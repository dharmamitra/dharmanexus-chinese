['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a06_15']	初來意者，夫行不虛設，必有其德。	初來意者，夫行不虛設，必有其德。	First, as for the reason for the chapter, practice is not empty and must have its virtues.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a08_3']	既解行圓妙，必勝德難思，收前行願成信德用，故次來也。	既解行圓妙，必勝德難思，收前行願成信德用，故次來也。	Since understanding and practice are perfect and wondrous, the supreme virtues must be inconceivable. It gathers the previous practices and vows to form the virtues and functions of faith, so it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a10_15']	又前智首舉果徵因，文殊廣顯其因略標其果，云獲一切勝妙功德，故問賢首令廣斯言，是以偈初躡前起後。	又前智首舉果徵因，文殊廣顯其因略標其果，云獲一切勝妙功德，故問賢首令廣斯言，是以偈初躡前起後。	Moreover, the previous chapter on Wisdom-head raised the effect to inquire about the cause. Mañjuśrī extensively revealed the cause and briefly indicated the effect, saying it attains all supreme and wondrous merits, so it asks Worthy Leader to extensively explain these words. Therefore, the beginning of the verse treads on the previous to give rise to the next.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a12_7']	二釋名者，謂體性至順調善曰賢，吉祥勝德超絕名首，即以此名。	二釋名者，謂體性至順調善曰賢，吉祥勝德超絕名首，即以此名。	Second, as for explaining the name, it means the essence is utmost compliance and goodness is called worthy, and auspicious supreme virtues surpass and are called leader. This is the name.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a14_2']	菩薩演說此法，賢即是首，賢首之品以當賢位之初，攝諸德故偏舉賢名。	菩薩演說此法，賢即是首，賢首之品以當賢位之初，攝諸德故偏舉賢名。	The bodhisattva expounds this Dharma, and the worthy is precisely the leader. The chapter on Worthy Leaders is at the beginning of the worthy stage, and it comprehensively includes all virtues, so it specifically uses the name worthy.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a17_6']	三宗趣者，於信門中成普賢行德而自在莊嚴，無方大用建立眾生，通貫始終該攝諸位以為其宗，令起圓融信行成位德用而為意趣。	三宗趣者，於信門中成普賢行德而自在莊嚴，無方大用建立眾生，通貫始終該攝諸位以為其宗，令起圓融信行成位德用而為意趣。	Third, as for the purport, within the gate of faith, it is to perfect the virtues of Samantabhadra's practices and be self-majestic and dignified, establishing sentient beings with vast and unrestricted great functions, penetrating from beginning to end and encompassing all stages as its purport, causing the arising of the practices of perfect and harmonious faith to accomplish the virtues and functions of the stages as its intent.

['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a20_13']	先結前已說。	先結前已說。	First, it concludes what has been said before.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a21_4']	順違皆順，客塵不能濁其心；	順違皆順，客塵不能濁其心；	Following and opposing are both in accord, and guests and dust cannot muddy one's mind;
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a22_5']	悲智雙游，萬境不能亂其慮，是曰清淨行矣。	悲智雙游，萬境不能亂其慮，是曰清淨行矣。	Compassion and wisdom both roam, and myriad realms cannot disturb one's thoughts. This is called the practice of purity.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a22_17']	大功德者，即前所成之果。	大功德者，即前所成之果。	Great merit refers to the fruits accomplished before.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a23_13']	後「欲顯示」下生後，文含始終。	後「欲顯示」下生後，文含始終。	Later, below to reveal, it leads in, with the text containing the beginning and end.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a24_17']	約終則顯示信滿菩提心殊勝功德，廣具五位因行盡故；	約終則顯示信滿菩提心殊勝功德，廣具五位因行盡故；	In terms of the end, it reveals the supreme merits of the perfection of faith and the mind of enlightenment, because it extensively possesses the causes and practices of the five stages to the end;
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a25_15']	約始但於生死誓證菩提，萬德攸依故。	約始但於生死誓證菩提，萬德攸依故。	In terms of the beginning, it simply vows to realize enlightenment in samsara, because the myriad virtues are based on it.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a26_3']	今顯示二偈。	今顯示二偈。	Now it reveals two verses.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a26_13']	正發起中，前半結前。	正發起中，前半結前。	In the initial inspiration, the first half concludes the previous.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a27_4']	偈文窄故，略無所成之德。	偈文窄故，略無所成之德。	Because the verse text is concise, it omits the virtues to be accomplished.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a28_6']	後半勸說，令說修行之德，則與長行文有影略。	後半勸說，令說修行之德，則與長行文有影略。	The second half encourages speaking, to speak the virtues of practice, which then has a shadow and omission with the prose text.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a28_19']	第二「時賢首」下賢首廣說。	第二「時賢首」下賢首廣說。	The second, At that time, the Worthy and Supreme One... is the extensive explanation by the Worthy and Supreme One.

['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618a29_17']	舉以偈答者，此略有二：	舉以偈答者，此略有二：	Raising it to answer with verses has two aspects:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b01_15']	一少言攝多義故、二美詞讚說令淨信故。	一少言攝多義故、二美詞讚說令淨信故。	First, because it condenses many meanings in few words, and second, because it praises and explains with beautiful words to make people believe.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b02_18']	以始德該終，散說難盡故，顯此勝妙之功德故。	以始德該終，散說難盡故，顯此勝妙之功德故。	Because the virtues of the beginning pervade the end, it is difficult to fully explain them in detail, so it reveals these supreme and wonderful merits.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b04_2']	第二正顯，偈詞有三百五十九頌半，大為三分：	第二正顯，偈詞有三百五十九頌半，大為三分：	The second, the correct revelation, has three hundred and fifty-nine and a half verses, which are divided into three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b05_15']	初四頌謙讚許說分、次三百四十六偈半正說勝德分、三九偈校量勸持分。	初四頌謙讚許說分、次三百四十六偈半正說勝德分、三九偈校量勸持分。	The first four verses are the section on humbly praising and permitting speaking, next, 346 and a half verses are the section on correctly speaking of the superior virtues, and finally, nine verses are the section on comparing and encouraging upholding.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b06_1']	初中分二：	初中分二：	In the beginning, there are two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b07_2']	初偈總明，前半讚問勸修、後半謙己少說。	初偈總明，前半讚問勸修、後半謙己少說。	The first verse generally clarifies, with the first half praising the question and encouraging practice, and the second half humbly speaking a little.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b07_10']	海喻，次下當明。	海喻，次下當明。	The analogy of the ocean will be explained below.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b08_10']	後三開章以發心之德，況出修行巧顯深廣。	後三開章以發心之德，況出修行巧顯深廣。	The latter three open up the chapters, with the virtues of arousing the mind surpassing the cultivation of practices, skillfully revealing the profound and vast.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b09_9']	於中，初偈舉發心章、次偈況出修行章。	於中，初偈舉發心章、次偈況出修行章。	Among them, the first verse raises the chapter on arousing the mind, and the next verse surpasses the chapter on cultivating practices.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b10_18']	初心祈於當證，德已叵量，況長時入位遍修，故多佛不能盡說。	初心祈於當證，德已叵量，況長時入位遍修，故多佛不能盡說。	The initial mind aspires to the realization to come, and its virtues are already immeasurable, let alone entering the stages for a long time and cultivating everywhere, therefore, many Buddhas cannot fully explain it.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b11_6']	後偈許說分齊。	後偈許說分齊。	The latter verse permits the scope of speaking.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b11_11']	前半法說。	前半法說。	The first half is a doctrinal explanation.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b12_14']	如是者，雙指發心、修行，下文具顯故，前文雙問故。	如是者，雙指發心、修行，下文具顯故，前文雙問故。	Thus refers to both arousing the mind and cultivating practices, as will be fully revealed in the following text, and because the previous text asked about both.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b13_3']	後半喻明，然有二意：	後半喻明，然有二意：	The latter half clarifies with an analogy, but there are two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b14_12']	一顯喻少分，謂發心行德如太空大地，所說者陿如足履一塵。	一顯喻少分，謂發心行德如太空大地，所說者陿如足履一塵。	First, the analogy is partially revealed: the virtues of the practice of generating the mind are like space and the earth, while what is spoken is narrow, like treading on a single dust mote.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b16_1']	二密喻不異，謂鳥足之空不異太空，微細之塵不殊大地。	二密喻不異，謂鳥足之空不異太空，微細之塵不殊大地。	Second, the analogy secretly shows non-difference: the space under the bird's feet is no different from space, and the tiny dust mote is no different from the great earth.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b17_1']	故此略說義無不周，若廣若略皆無邊故。	故此略說義無不周，若廣若略皆無邊故。	Therefore, this brief explanation has nothing incomplete in its meaning. Whether extensive or brief, it is all boundless.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b18_10']	〈出現品〉云「如鳥飛虛空經於百年，已經過處未經過處皆不可量。	〈出現品〉云「如鳥飛虛空經於百年，已經過處未經過處皆不可量。	The chapter on manifestation states: Like a bird flying in the sky for a hundred years, the places it has passed and not passed are both immeasurable.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b18_14']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b19_5']	虛空無邊際故」等。	虛空無邊際故」等。	Because space has no boundaries.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b19_15']	彼就果行，此就因德。	彼就果行，此就因德。	That is based on fruition practice, while this is based on causal virtues.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b21_5']	然普賢行德似同佛果，是故皆以虛空為量，上下文中皆同此說。	然普賢行德似同佛果，是故皆以虛空為量，上下文中皆同此說。	However, the virtues of Samantabhadra's practice seem to be the same as the Buddha's fruition. Therefore, they are all measured by space. The passages above and below all say the same thing.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b22_13']	此初發心，與下文十住初發心住及〈發心功德品〉各何別耶？	此初發心，與下文十住初發心住及〈發心功德品〉各何別耶？	This initial generation of the mind, and the initial generation of the mind in the ten abodes below, as well as the chapter on the merits of generating the mind - what are the differences between them?
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b24_2']	此中發心該於初後，取其成德乃是信終，取其為本乃在初發。	此中發心該於初後，取其成德乃是信終，取其為本乃在初發。	Here, the arousal of the mind encompasses the beginning and end. Taking its perfected virtues is the end of faith, taking its basis is at the initial arousal.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b24_13']	雖如輕毛，功歸初簣故。	雖如輕毛，功歸初簣故。	Although like a light feather, the merit returns to the first mound.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b25_7']	十住初發，即是此終成彼初發。	十住初發，即是此終成彼初發。	The initial arousal of the ten abodes is precisely this end, which perfects that initial arousal.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b26_12']	此終為能發、彼是所發，此正是發起之發，義兼開發；	此終為能發、彼是所發，此正是發起之發，義兼開發；	This end is the arouser, that is the aroused. This is precisely the arousal of arousing, the meaning is inclusive of revealing;
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b27_4']	彼是開發之發，義兼發起。	彼是開發之發，義兼發起。	That is the revealing of arousal, the meaning is inclusive of arousing.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618b28_2']	其〈發心品〉正顯十住初心之功德耳。	其〈發心品〉正顯十住初心之功德耳。	The chapter on arousing the mind precisely reveals the merits of the initial mind of the ten abodes.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c01_15']	以斯甄別，非無有異，故《瓔珞》云「發心住者，是人始從具縛未識三寶，乃至值佛菩薩，教法中起一念信便發菩提心。	以斯甄別，非無有異，故《瓔珞》云「發心住者，是人始從具縛未識三寶，乃至值佛菩薩，教法中起一念信便發菩提心。	Distinguishing in this way, there is no difference. Therefore, the Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle says: The abode of arousing the mind is when this person begins with complete bondage and has not yet recognized the Three Jewels, up to encountering the Buddha and bodhisattvas, and within the teachings gives rise to a single thought of faith and thus arouses the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c03_1']	」既云始從凡夫最初發心，明知此中發心該於初後。	」既云始從凡夫最初發心，明知此中發心該於初後。	Since it says it begins with the initial arousal of the mind as an ordinary person, it is clear that here the arousal of the mind encompasses the beginning and end.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c03_3']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c04_2']	此既是初，何得乃具後諸行位及普賢德耶？	此既是初，何得乃具後諸行位及普賢德耶？	Since this is the first [stage], how can it already possess the later practices, stages, and virtues of Samantabhadra?
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c04_11']	古德釋此略有二門：	古德釋此略有二門：	Ancient masters have explained this in two ways:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c06_24']	一行布次第門，謂從微至著、從淺至深，次第相乘以階彼岸，如《瓔珞》、《仁王》、《起信》、《瑜伽》等說。	一行布次第門，謂從微至著、從淺至深，次第相乘以階彼岸，如《瓔珞》、《仁王》、《起信》、《瑜伽》等說。	The first is the sequential approach, which means from subtle to obvious, from shallow to deep, the stages successively carry each other to reach the other shore, as explained in the Ornament of the Scriptures, the Benevolent Kings, the Awakening of Faith, the Yoga, and other texts.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c08_13']	二圓融通攝門，謂一位即具一切位等，如此經所說，亦如《大品》等中一行具一切行。	二圓融通攝門，謂一位即具一切位等，如此經所說，亦如《大品》等中一行具一切行。	The second is the approach of perfect fusion and inclusion, which means that each stage already possesses all stages, as explained in this sutra, and also as in the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, where one practice already possesses all practices.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c08_19']	此中有二門：	此中有二門：	This has two approaches:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c09_13']	一緣起相由門、二法界融攝門。	一緣起相由門、二法界融攝門。	The first is the approach of dependent origination and mutual dependence, and the second is the approach of the fusion and inclusion of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c11_1']	前中，普攬一切始終諸位，無邊行海同一緣起，為普賢行德。	前中，普攬一切始終諸位，無邊行海同一緣起，為普賢行德。	In the former, all beginning and ending stages and boundless ocean of practices are universally embraced as a single dependent origination, becoming the virtues of Samantabhadra's practices.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c11_12']	良以諸緣相望略有二義：	良以諸緣相望略有二義：	This is because the various conditions, when compared, have two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c13_1']	一約用，由相待故，有有力、無力義，是故得相收及相入也。	一約用，由相待故，有有力、無力義，是故得相收及相入也。	First, in terms of function, due to mutual dependence, there is the meaning of having power and being powerless, therefore, they can mutually include and enter each other.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c14_8']	二約體，由相作故，有有體、無體義，是故得相即及相入是也。	二約體，由相作故，有有體、無體義，是故得相即及相入是也。	Second, in terms of essence, due to mutual transformation, there is the meaning of having substance and being substanceless, therefore, they can mutually identify and enter each other.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c15_8']	此經之中依斯義故，行位相收總有四說：	此經之中依斯義故，行位相收總有四說：	Based on this meaning, in this sutra, the practices and stages mutually include each other in four ways:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c16_14']	一或始具終，如此門中具一切行位，普賢德海者是也。	一或始具終，如此門中具一切行位，普賢德海者是也。	First, sometimes the beginning is complete in the end, such as in this chapter, which is complete with all practices and stages, and is the virtue ocean of Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c18_1']	二或終具始，並在十地位，後如下文〈十定〉、〈十通〉等說。	二或終具始，並在十地位，後如下文〈十定〉、〈十通〉等說。	Second, sometimes the end is complete in the beginning, all in the ten grounds, as explained below in the chapters on the ten samādhis and ten supernormal powers.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c19_23']	三或諸位齊收，並在十住等，一一位中各收一切，悉至究竟，如下文〈十住〉、〈十行〉等說。	三或諸位齊收，並在十住等，一一位中各收一切，悉至究竟，如下文〈十住〉、〈十行〉等說。	Third, sometimes the various stages are equally included, all in the ten abodes and so forth, with each stage including all, reaching the ultimate, as explained below in the chapters on the ten abodes, ten practices, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c20_20']	四或諸位皆泯、行德顯然，如〈離世間品〉說。	四或諸位皆泯、行德顯然，如〈離世間品〉說。	Fourth, sometimes the various stages are all negated, while the practices and virtues are clearly manifest, as explained in the chapter on leaving the world.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c22_7']	二法界融攝門者，謂此諸位及所修行，皆不離普賢無盡法界。	二法界融攝門者，謂此諸位及所修行，皆不離普賢無盡法界。	As for the second gate of the fusion and subsumption of the Dharma realm, it means that these stages and the practices cultivated are all inseparable from the inexhaustible Dharma realm of Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c23_15']	然此法界圓融無限，隨在一位即具一切，今在信門收無不盡。	然此法界圓融無限，隨在一位即具一切，今在信門收無不盡。	However, this Dharma realm is perfectly fused and limitless. Within each stage, it is complete in all aspects. Now, within the gate of faith, it is completely subsumed.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c24_12']	下諸位中皆具一切者，並準此釋。	下諸位中皆具一切者，並準此釋。	In the following stages, all are complete in all aspects. This should be understood in the same way.

['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c25_16']	下〈發心功德品〉亦說初心具無邊德，與此何別？	下〈發心功德品〉亦說初心具無邊德，與此何別？	In the chapter on the merits of generating the mind, it is also said that the initial stage is endowed with boundless virtues. How is this different from this?
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c25_18']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c26_16']	此據行首信門所具，彼約行本菩提心具。	此據行首信門所具，彼約行本菩提心具。	This is based on the virtues subsumed within the initial stage of faith. That is based on the virtues subsumed within the fundamental bodhi mind of practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c26_18']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c27_9']	約法相收，是則可爾。	約法相收，是則可爾。	If subsumed according to the characteristics of the Dharma, that may be so.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c28_13']	約人修行，豈十千劫修信纔滿，即得如此無邊德海？	約人修行，豈十千劫修信纔滿，即得如此無邊德海？	In terms of a person's cultivation, how can one attain such an ocean of boundless virtues merely by completing the cultivation of faith in ten thousand eons?
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c28_15']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0618c29_6']	以法是圓融具德法故。	以法是圓融具德法故。	It is because the Dharma is the Dharma of perfect fusion and endowment.

It means that when observing the faculties to enter concentration, they should emerge from the faculties, yet they emerge from the objects. This is to show that faculties and objects are only one mind, and the principle of dependent origination is non-dual and interpenetrating. Therefore, the faculties enter and the objects emerge.

It means that in order to enter the concentration on phenomena, one should enter the concentration on principle. In order to contemplate the emptiness of nature, one should enter the concentration on phenomena and enter the concentration on principle.
['ZH_T35_1735_016:0624c03_13']	以契即事之理而不動故，入理即是入事；	以契即事之理而不動故，入理即是入事；	Because it accords with the principle that is phenomena without moving, entering principle is the same as entering phenomena;

This is because the contemplated objects are both the mundane and the real, and the dharma realm is non-dual, so the wisdom that discerns events is precisely the wisdom of non-arising, and the two contemplations are precisely one mind.
