['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b10_25']	21 維摩經略疏卷第二十一「且置」下，四、正明問疾。	21 維摩經略疏卷第二十一「且置」下，四、正明問疾。	In the Brief Commentary on the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, Scroll 21, below to put aside, the fourth is the correct explanation of inquiring about illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b11_7']	上來言談是賓主相見之儀，非其正意。	上來言談是賓主相見之儀，非其正意。	The above discussion is the etiquette of the guest and host meeting each other, not the main point.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b12_10']	神解既齊，辨無窮盡妨宣佛旨，故言「且置是事」。	神解既齊，辨無窮盡妨宣佛旨，故言「且置是事」。	Since the spiritual understanding is the same, the discussion is endless, obstructing the proclamation of the Buddha's teachings, therefore it says to put aside this matter.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b12_14']	文為二：	文為二：	The text is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b13_3']	一前宣佛旨、二文殊自述。	一前宣佛旨、二文殊自述。	First, proclaiming the Buddha's teachings; second, Mañjuśrī's own account.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b13_18']	本銜佛命，師旨尊重，故須前宣。	本銜佛命，師旨尊重，故須前宣。	Originally receiving the Buddha's order, the teacher's meaning is profound, therefore it is necessary to proclaim it first.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b15_2']	次須問託疾之深致，覈發大士闡揚利物，故自述己情。	次須問託疾之深致，覈發大士闡揚利物，故自述己情。	Next, it is necessary to inquire about the profound reason for the illness, investigating the great being's elucidation and benefiting beings, therefore he himself describes his own feelings.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b15_17']	若但宣佛旨，聲聞菩薩不應各辭；	若但宣佛旨，聲聞菩薩不應各辭；	If he only proclaims the Buddha's teachings, the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas should not each decline;
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b17_9']	但對勝人慰問疾義，往復事難餘人不堪，意在於此，故文殊次述己情。	但對勝人慰問疾義，往復事難餘人不堪，意在於此，故文殊次述己情。	But it is difficult for others to bear the task of going back and forth to comfort the sick for such a superior person. The intention is in this, so Mañjuśrī next explains his own thoughts.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b17_14']	宣旨為二：	宣旨為二：	The proclamation is in two parts:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b18_4']	一正宣旨、二總述佛意。	一正宣旨、二總述佛意。	First, the correct proclamation; second, a general explanation of the Buddha's intention.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b18_11']	初文三句為三：	初文三句為三：	The first text has three sentences, which are divided into three:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b19_17']	初句云「是疾寧可忍不」，淨名法身本自無疾，無忍不忍。	初句云「是疾寧可忍不」，淨名法身本自無疾，無忍不忍。	The first sentence says, Is this illness bearable or not? The Dharma body of Vimalakīrti is originally without illness, and there is no question of whether it is bearable or not.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b20_10']	既為眾生，還約眾生論忍不忍。	既為眾生，還約眾生論忍不忍。	Since he is for the sake of sentient beings, he still discusses whether it is bearable or not in terms of sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b21_16']	但佛處世迹同世間，故有勞問，如毘尼中佛亦慰問諸比丘：	但佛處世迹同世間，故有勞問，如毘尼中佛亦慰問諸比丘：	But since the Buddha abides in the world and his traces are the same as those in the world, there is a question of fatigue, just as in the Vinaya the Buddha also comforts the bhikṣus, saying:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b22_2']	道路疲不？	道路疲不？	Are you tired from the road?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b22_8']	乞食易得不？	乞食易得不？	Is it easy to beg for food or not?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b23_5']	又如《大品》諸佛自相慰問少病少惱等。	又如《大品》諸佛自相慰問少病少惱等。	Also, like in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra where the buddhas comfort each other, saying they have few illnesses and few afflictions, etc.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b23_17']	《智論》釋之，皆有深致。	《智論》釋之，皆有深致。	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom explains this, and it all has profound meaning.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b25_9']	今佛問淨名云寧可忍不者，淨名為眾生故疾，眾生不同，疾有可忍不可忍。	今佛問淨名云寧可忍不者，淨名為眾生故疾，眾生不同，疾有可忍不可忍。	Now the Buddha asks Vimalakīrti, Can you bear it or not? Vimalakīrti's illness is for the sake of sentient beings. Sentient beings are not the same, and illnesses can be bearable or unendurable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b26_3']	如人雖病而猶行涉是為可忍；	如人雖病而猶行涉是為可忍；	It is like a person who, although sick, is still able to move around. This is bearable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b26_18']	或有疾苦，起止不能，是不可忍。	或有疾苦，起止不能，是不可忍。	There may be those whose illness causes them to be unable to move or sit. This is unendurable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b27_3']	今亦約四土：	今亦約四土：	Now, it is also discussed in terms of the four lands:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655b29_11']	一、約同居穢淨，穢土疾者則有六道，十惡四重等業是三惡因疾，三途苦果是果疾，此之重疾是不可忍相。	一、約同居穢淨，穢土疾者則有六道，十惡四重等業是三惡因疾，三途苦果是果疾，此之重疾是不可忍相。	First, in terms of the defiled and pure lands of the same realm, the sick in the defiled land have the causes of illness of the six destinies, the ten evil deeds, the four grave offenses, etc., which are the causes of illness of the three evil destinies. The painful fruits of the three evil destinies are the fruits of illness. This serious illness is the aspect of unendurability.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c02_2']	若十善是修羅人天因疾，八苦五衰等是果疾，此苦小輕是可忍相。	若十善是修羅人天因疾，八苦五衰等是果疾，此苦小輕是可忍相。	If the ten wholesome deeds are the causes of illness of the asuras, humans, and gods, the eight sufferings and five decays, etc., are the fruits of illness. This lesser suffering is the aspect of endurability.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c03_8']	復次同居穢土果疾是一，而因疾九種不同，謂六道三乘。	復次同居穢土果疾是一，而因疾九種不同，謂六道三乘。	Furthermore, in the defiled land of the same realm, the fruits of illness are one, but the causes of illness are of nine kinds, namely the six destinies and the three vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c04_18']	若有六道因疾，無三乘根性，是不可忍相，若有三乘根性即是可忍。	若有六道因疾，無三乘根性，是不可忍相，若有三乘根性即是可忍。	If there are causes of illness in the six destinies but no potential for the three vehicles, this is an unbearable sign. If there is the potential for the three vehicles, it is then bearable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c06_15']	復次凡夫修三乘行根有利鈍、遮有輕重，根利遮輕疾則可忍，根鈍遮重則不可忍。	復次凡夫修三乘行根有利鈍、遮有輕重，根利遮輕疾則可忍，根鈍遮重則不可忍。	Furthermore, ordinary beings cultivating the practices of the three vehicles have sharp or dull faculties and light or heavy hindrances. If the faculties are sharp and the hindrances are light, the illness is then bearable. If the faculties are dull and the hindrances are heavy, it is then unbearable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c08_4']	復次三乘進行斷結，斷結者輕是則可忍，未斷者重則不可忍。	復次三乘進行斷結，斷結者輕是則可忍，未斷者重則不可忍。	Furthermore, those who practice the three vehicles and sever the bonds have light bonds and are then able to bear it. Those who have not severed them have heavy bonds and are unable to bear it.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c08_13']	淨名權疾皆悉同之。	淨名權疾皆悉同之。	The skillful illness of Vimalakīrti is all the same as this.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c09_14']	次同居淨土，除四惡趣，但約人天，三乘類前。	次同居淨土，除四惡趣，但約人天，三乘類前。	Next, in the Pure Land of the Shared Teaching, excluding the four evil destinies, it is only about humans and gods, with the three vehicles classified as before.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c10_10']	二、約有餘土，無分段之苦，通皆可忍。	二、約有餘土，無分段之苦，通皆可忍。	Second, in the Land of the Remainder Teaching, there is no suffering of the stage of differentiation, and all are generally able to bear it.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c12_12']	但麁細相形，二乘通教菩薩生彼土者鈍是不可忍，別圓菩薩生彼土者利是可忍，權同亦爾。	但麁細相形，二乘通教菩薩生彼土者鈍是不可忍，別圓菩薩生彼土者利是可忍，權同亦爾。	However, the coarse and subtle characteristics are distinguished. Those of the two vehicles and the bodhisattvas of the Shared Teaching who are born in that land have dull faculties and are unable to bear it. The bodhisattvas of the Distinct and Perfect Teachings who are born in that land have sharp faculties and are able to bear it. The skillful [illnesses] are also the same as this.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c14_14']	三、約果報土者，彼諸菩薩皆是法身無三乘異，雖有無明自體因果之疾皆悉可忍，權同亦然。	三、約果報土者，彼諸菩薩皆是法身無三乘異，雖有無明自體因果之疾皆悉可忍，權同亦然。	Third, in terms of the Land of Retribution, those bodhisattvas are all Dharma-bodies without the distinction of the three vehicles. Although there are the illnesses of ignorance, self-nature, cause, and effect, they are all able to endure them. The provisional is also the same.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c15_16']	若地位相形非為不得，但不如前有餘橫有其相。	若地位相形非為不得，但不如前有餘橫有其相。	If the stages are compared, it is not that they are not obtained, but it is not like the previous remaining horizontal aspects.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c17_11']	四、常寂光既是極地，眾惡永盡眾善普會，無疾無惱、無實權之疾忍不忍別。	四、常寂光既是極地，眾惡永盡眾善普會，無疾無惱、無實權之疾忍不忍別。	Fourth, the eternally quiescent and illuminated is the ultimate stage, where all evils are eternally extinguished and all wholesome dharmas are universally gathered. There is no illness, no affliction, no distinction between the real and provisional illnesses that are endured or not endured.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c18_10']	佛止一句慰問淨名，廣博深遠無所不該。	佛止一句慰問淨名，廣博深遠無所不該。	The Buddha's single phrase of consolation and inquiry to Vimalakīrti is vast, profound, and far-reaching, encompassing everything.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c18_12']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c19_4']	上言寂光有疾，今何以言無？	上言寂光有疾，今何以言無？	Above it was said that the eternally quiescent and illuminated has illness, but why is it said to be without now?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c19_6']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c20_2']	不定，但隨聖教，教有即有、教無即無。	不定，但隨聖教，教有即有、教無即無。	It is not definite. It is just in accordance with the holy teachings. When the teachings exist, it exists. When the teachings do not exist, it does not exist.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c20_12']	今據極地，無實疾也。	今據極地，無實疾也。	Now, based on the ultimate stage, there is no real illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c21_3']	「療治有損」，次宣第二句。	「療治有損」，次宣第二句。	The treatment causes harm is the second phrase that is proclaimed next.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c21_18']	療治有損者，世間有疾必須醫療。	療治有損者，世間有疾必須醫療。	The treatment causes harm means that when there is illness in the world, it must be treated.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c22_13']	既為眾生，苦治眾生，是治淨名。	既為眾生，苦治眾生，是治淨名。	Since it is for sentient beings, it is a pure treatment of sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c23_12']	但眾生疾有三不同，謂見思、無知、無明。	但眾生疾有三不同，謂見思、無知、無明。	However, there are three different kinds of illnesses for sentient beings: views and thoughts, ignorance, and ignorance.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c25_1']	此之三疾，即界內外一切因果諸疾之本，用三觀治之則三疾俱滅。	此之三疾，即界內外一切因果諸疾之本，用三觀治之則三疾俱滅。	These three illnesses are the root of all illnesses of cause and effect within the three realms, and using the three contemplations to treat them will eliminate the three illnesses.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c25_21']	具在《玄義》三觀中明，至釋下文自可見也。	具在《玄義》三觀中明，至釋下文自可見也。	It is fully explained in the three contemplations of the Profound Meaning, and it can be seen in the explanation below.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c26_4']	亦約四土：	亦約四土：	It is also about the four lands:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c27_4']	一、同居者，一從假入空，正治同居見思之疾。	一、同居者，一從假入空，正治同居見思之疾。	First, the same dwelling: one enters from the provisional into emptiness, which directly treats the illness of views and thoughts in the same dwelling.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c28_4']	二從空入假，正治有餘恒沙，傍治同居無知。	二從空入假，正治有餘恒沙，傍治同居無知。	Second, entering from emptiness into the provisional, which directly treats the illnesses of the remaining and the endless, and indirectly treats the ignorance in the same dwelling.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0655c28_19']	三中道正觀，正治有餘果報無明。	三中道正觀，正治有餘果報無明。	Third, the correct contemplation of the middle way, which directly treats the ignorance of the remaining rewards.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a01_2']	利根菩薩，傍治同居見思無知，亦傍治有餘無知。	利根菩薩，傍治同居見思無知，亦傍治有餘無知。	The sharp-witted bodhisattvas indirectly treat the views and thoughts and ignorance in the same dwelling, and also indirectly treat the ignorance in the remaining.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a01_16']	寂光無疾可治，今明治同居土。	寂光無疾可治，今明治同居土。	The tranquil light has no illness to be treated, and now it treats the same dwelling land.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a02_4']	《大論》作四種料簡：	《大論》作四種料簡：	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra gives four kinds of distinctions:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a03_6']	一根鈍遮重，即是鈍根凡夫，煩惱垢重不可治也。	一根鈍遮重，即是鈍根凡夫，煩惱垢重不可治也。	1. Dull faculties and heavy hindrances, referring to those of dull faculties and ordinary beings, whose afflictions and defilements are heavy and cannot be cured.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a04_14']	二鈍根遮輕，如周利槃特，一夏止誦一偈，而能發真成大羅漢。	二鈍根遮輕，如周利槃特，一夏止誦一偈，而能發真成大羅漢。	2. Dull faculties and light hindrances, like Cūdapanthaka, who could only recite one verse in one summer, yet was able to give rise to the true [path] and become a great arhat.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a06_11']	三根利遮重，如鴦掘魔羅，日殺九百九十九人，但其根利、遮不能障，見佛即悟。	三根利遮重，如鴦掘魔羅，日殺九百九十九人，但其根利、遮不能障，見佛即悟。	3. Sharp faculties and heavy hindrances, like Aṅgulimāla, who killed 999 people a day, but because his faculties were sharp, the hindrances could not obstruct him, and upon seeing the Buddha he immediately awakened.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a07_16']	四根利遮輕，如舍利弗，聞阿說示說三諦一偈，即得初果。	四根利遮輕，如舍利弗，聞阿說示說三諦一偈，即得初果。	4. Sharp faculties and light hindrances, like Śāriputra, who heard Aśvajit's explanation of the three truths in one verse and immediately attained the first fruit.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a08_7']	淨名同此等疾難損易損。	淨名同此等疾難損易損。	Vimalakīrti's illness is difficult to harm and easy to harm.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a09_8']	如四句中，槃特、鴦掘、身子等，皆是療治有損；	如四句中，槃特、鴦掘、身子等，皆是療治有損；	Among the four phrases, Cūdapanthaka, Aṅgulimāla, Śāriputra, and others are all curable and can be harmed.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a09_18']	若就有餘，無永不損。	若就有餘，無永不損。	If we consider the remaining [afflictions], there is never no harm.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a10_17']	若三乘相形，亦作三種分別有損，權疾亦然。	若三乘相形，亦作三種分別有損，權疾亦然。	If we distinguish the three vehicles from each other, there are also three kinds of distinctions with harm. The expedient illness is also like this.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a12_14']	若入果報平等法界，此是利根，但有一無明遮，約位傳論輕重無別，橫遮止有一損。	若入果報平等法界，此是利根，但有一無明遮，約位傳論輕重無別，橫遮止有一損。	If one enters the realm of retribution and the equality of dharmas, this is a person of sharp faculties. There is only one ignorance obstructing, and in terms of stages, there is no difference in lightness or heaviness. Horizontally obstructing, there is only one loss.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a13_19']	若約初心宿業，或作二句分別，無鈍根也，權疾亦然。	若約初心宿業，或作二句分別，無鈍根也，權疾亦然。	If in terms of the initial mind and past karma, it can be divided into two phrases. There are no dull faculties. The same is true for expedient illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a15_1']	常寂光土極地寂然，無此分別，故佛問云療治有損。	常寂光土極地寂然，無此分別，故佛問云療治有損。	In the land of constant quiescence and light, the ultimate ground is tranquil, without this discrimination. Therefore, the Buddha asks, Does the treatment cause harm?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a15_14']	「不至增乎」，次宣第三句。	「不至增乎」，次宣第三句。	Will it not increase? Next, he proclaims the third phrase.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a16_6']	此問意者，如世人疾具有四種：	此問意者，如世人疾具有四種：	The meaning of this question is that illnesses in the world have four types:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a17_9']	一有從初服藥，但增而不損，終無瘥理，是名增增。	一有從初服藥，但增而不損，終無瘥理，是名增增。	First, there are those who, from the beginning of taking medicine, only increase and do not decrease. In the end, there is no way to cure. This is called increasing increase.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a18_4']	二或雖困篤，方治即愈，是名增損。	二或雖困篤，方治即愈，是名增損。	Second, some, although gravely ill, are cured as soon as treated. This is called increasing decrease.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a19_4']	三或有服藥，初雖暫損而後更增，是名損增。	三或有服藥，初雖暫損而後更增，是名損增。	Third, some, although temporarily harmed by taking medicine, later increase again. This is called decreasing increase.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a19_19']	四從初漸損乃至平復，是為損損。	四從初漸損乃至平復，是為損損。	Fourth, from the beginning, gradually decreasing until recovery. This is called decreasing decrease.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a21_1']	淨名應生同居，說十二部經治眾生疾，亦四根緣：	淨名應生同居，說十二部經治眾生疾，亦四根緣：	Vimalakīrti should be born in the Shared and Distinct [realms] to expound the twelve divisions of the scriptures to cure the illnesses of sentient beings, which is also based on the four kinds of faculties:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a22_14']	一增增者，即底下凡夫，若為說法，更起誹謗闡提之罪，如善星、調達等也。	一增增者，即底下凡夫，若為說法，更起誹謗闡提之罪，如善星、調達等也。	1. The increasing-increasing type refers to the lowest ordinary beings. If the Dharma is expounded to them, they give rise to slander and the sin of icchantika, like Subhadra and Devadatta.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a23_9']	二增損者，如尸利鞠多、鴦掘等也。	二增損者，如尸利鞠多、鴦掘等也。	2. The increasing-decreasing type refers to Śṛgālavādin and Aṅgulimāla.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a25_2']	三損增者，如《大論》明四禪比丘謂是四果，臨終見生處，謗無涅槃，即墮地獄。	三損增者，如《大論》明四禪比丘謂是四果，臨終見生處，謗無涅槃，即墮地獄。	3. The decreasing-increasing type is as explained in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra, where it says that bhikṣus in the four dhyānas consider themselves to have attained the four fruits, but when they see their place of rebirth at the time of death, they slander nirvāṇa and fall into hell.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a25_22']	又《毘曇》、《成實》明退法人，皆是其相。	又《毘曇》、《成實》明退法人，皆是其相。	Also, the Abhidharma and Satyasiddhi-śāstra explain that those who regress are all of this type.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656a26_11']	四損損者，即身子等諸得道人。	四損損者，即身子等諸得道人。	4. The decreasing-decreasing type refers to Śāriputra and other people who have attained the Way.

The expedient illness of Vimalakīrti is the same as their origin.

These two are followed by birth, old age, sickness, and death.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c10_5']	」無明是過去癡，愛是現在癡，二世相避故立兩名。	」無明是過去癡，愛是現在癡，二世相避故立兩名。	Ignorance is the delusion of the past, and craving is the delusion of the present. The two periods are distinguished by two names.

The present craving and grasping moisten existence, and then there is future birth and death. Therefore, there is the wheel of the twelve links of dependent origination, revolving through the three realms and the twenty-five forms of existence. Experiencing birth and death, there is the cause of illness and the effect of illness.

['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c17_1']	何者？	何者？	What does this mean?

['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c19_15']	是二中間則有十二因緣因疾果疾，但是變易因緣與分段異。	是二中間則有十二因緣因疾果疾，但是變易因緣與分段異。	Between these two, there are the causes and effects of the twelve links of dependent arising, which are simply the causes and effects of the dependent arising of the transformation and change, different from those of the conditioned existence.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c21_15']	分段昇沈往返六趣，變易不爾，但約因愛生死，愛滅即生於上地，終不更退生於下地。	分段昇沈往返六趣，變易不爾，但約因愛生死，愛滅即生於上地，終不更退生於下地。	The conditioned existence rises and falls, going back and forth through the six destinies, but the transformation and change is not like this. It is only about the cause of craving and birth and death. When craving ceases, one is born in the upper realms, and never falls back to be born in the lower realms.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c21_18']	何者？	何者？	What does this mean?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c24_6']	三界結盡不生分段，亦不退細受麁，類如那含於欲身修得初禪，初禪死即生二禪，終不生欲界更退初禪。	三界結盡不生分段，亦不退細受麁，類如那含於欲身修得初禪，初禪死即生二禪，終不生欲界更退初禪。	When the bonds of the three realms are exhausted, one is not reborn in the conditioned realm, and one also does not regress from the subtle to the coarse. It is like the case of a non-returner who cultivates the first dhyāna in the desire realm. Upon death in the first dhyāna, they are immediately reborn in the second dhyāna, and never return to the desire realm to regress from the first dhyāna.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c25_9']	界內聖人尚爾，何況界外而更生分段及受麁變易？	界內聖人尚爾，何況界外而更生分段及受麁變易？	If even the sages within the realm of conditioned existence are like this, how much more so for those outside the realms who would be reborn in the conditioned realm and experience the coarse transformation body?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c27_1']	若變易眾生有此癡愛，淨名大悲即癡愛疾生，是答疾生之久近也。	若變易眾生有此癡愛，淨名大悲即癡愛疾生，是答疾生之久近也。	If the beings of the transformation body have this delusion and craving, then the great compassion of Vimalakīrti would give rise to the illness of delusion and craving. This answers the question of how long ago the illness arose.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0656c28_16']	若果報土無明未盡是癡，染依正是愛，是二中間有自體生死十二因緣因果疾生。	若果報土無明未盡是癡，染依正是愛，是二中間有自體生死十二因緣因果疾生。	If in the land of karmic rewards, ignorance has not yet been exhausted, this is delusion. Being tainted and dependent is craving. In between these two, there is the arising of the illness of the twelve links of dependent arising with their causes and effects.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0657a01_2']	故《勝鬘》云「無明住地其力最大，佛菩提智之所能斷。	故《勝鬘》云「無明住地其力最大，佛菩提智之所能斷。	Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says: The ground of ignorance has the greatest power, and can only be eliminated by the wisdom of Buddha-bodhi.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0657a03_1']	」若有餘癡愛疾滅，即果報癡愛疾生，淨名法身大悲即同其生，此亦答疾生之久近也。	」若有餘癡愛疾滅，即果報癡愛疾生，淨名法身大悲即同其生，此亦答疾生之久近也。	If there are other deluded attachments, they will quickly cease, and then the retribution of deluded attachments will quickly arise. The pure Dharma body and great compassion of Vimalakīrti will immediately arise together with it. This also answers the question of how long ago the illness arose.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0657a04_1']	寂光極地無實癡愛疾，故無權疾生之久近。	寂光極地無實癡愛疾，故無權疾生之久近。	In the ultimate stage of the quiescent light, there is no real deluded attachment or illness, so there is no question of how long ago the expedient illness arose.

The great compassion of Vimalakīrti without discrimination is also like this. Speaking of long and short is based on events.

Following the illnesses of sentient beings, the great compassion of the same essence arises from this, and is called the arising of long and short.

Beginningless ignorance gives rise to the myriad ignorances. The four inversions outside the realm and the four inversions within the realm. Vimalakīrti's exhaustion of the source of dependent origination is also like this.

['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a11_2']	所以至極法身離身無土、離土無身，身土理同而名有異。	所以至極法身離身無土、離土無身，身土理同而名有異。	Therefore, the ultimate Dharma body is apart from the body there is no land, apart from the land there is no body, the principle of body and land is the same but the names are different.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a12_9']	如天帝釋有多種名，解脫亦爾，或名毘盧遮那或名常寂光土。	如天帝釋有多種名，解脫亦爾，或名毘盧遮那或名常寂光土。	Just as the Heavenly Emperor has many names, liberation is also like this, sometimes called Vairocana or sometimes called the eternally quiescent light land.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a13_16']	故淨名空室表諸佛國空，唯置一床以疾而臥表三德解脫。	故淨名空室表諸佛國空，唯置一床以疾而臥表三德解脫。	Therefore, the empty room in the Vimalakīrti Sūtra illustrates the emptiness of the Buddha lands, only placing a bed with an illness to lie down illustrates the three kinds of liberation of the virtues.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a15_1']	若見室空即見以疾臥床，若見以疾臥床即見室空。	若見室空即見以疾臥床，若見以疾臥床即見室空。	If one sees the empty room, then one sees the bed with an illness to lie down on, if one sees the bed with an illness to lie down on, then one sees the empty room.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a16_5']	若見眾生心空即見諸佛國空，即心行中求得三解脫。	若見眾生心空即見諸佛國空，即心行中求得三解脫。	If one sees the emptiness of the mind of sentient beings, then one sees the emptiness of the Buddha lands, then one seeks and obtains the three kinds of liberation within the mind and activities.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a18_7']	故淨名因答佛國即相仍答諸佛解脫，則還扶成佛說不思議解脫之旨趣，顯佛國之宗致也。	故淨名因答佛國即相仍答諸佛解脫，則還扶成佛說不思議解脫之旨趣，顯佛國之宗致也。	Therefore, Vimalakīrti, in answering about the Buddha lands, immediately continues to answer about the liberation of the buddhas, thereby supporting and accomplishing the purport of the Buddha's teaching of the inconceivable liberation, and manifesting the fundamental purport of the Buddha lands.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a18_17']	助佛揚化，正意在此。	助佛揚化，正意在此。	The main intention of assisting the Buddha in spreading the teaching is in this.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a19_17']	下室內五品雖多有所明，結撮旨歸終從此出。	下室內五品雖多有所明，結撮旨歸終從此出。	Although the five chapters below the room have much to elucidate, the final conclusion of the purport returns to this.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a20_12']	「又仁所問」下，二、答無侍者。	「又仁所問」下，二、答無侍者。	Moreover, as for your question, is second, the answer to the lack of attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a21_4']	即表性淨永無愛見，故言無侍。	即表性淨永無愛見，故言無侍。	It immediately expresses the eternally pure nature without love or views, therefore saying there are no attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a22_7']	如世人侍，侍於兩邊驅馳使役，種種之侍正表此也。	如世人侍，侍於兩邊驅馳使役，種種之侍正表此也。	Like worldly people who serve, serving on both sides, driving and commanding, the various kinds of service correctly express this.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a22_11']	文為二：	文為二：	The text is in two parts:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a22_19']	一正答、二釋出。	一正答、二釋出。	First, the direct answer; second, the explanation.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a23_14']	一、正答云「一切眾魔外道皆吾侍也」。	一、正答云「一切眾魔外道皆吾侍也」。	First, the direct answer says, All māras and non-Buddhists are my attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a25_13']	此之答意，大士本以魔外為侍，今空室無侍，表常寂光無有愛見，即無魔外，故無侍也。	此之答意，大士本以魔外為侍，今空室無侍，表常寂光無有愛見，即無魔外，故無侍也。	The meaning of this answer is that the great being originally uses māras and non-Buddhists as attendants. Now, the empty room without attendants expresses the eternally quiescent light without love or views, which is the absence of māras and non-Buddhists, therefore there are no attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a26_13']	而有侍義者，若應三土有愛見眾生，即是魔外。	而有侍義者，若應三土有愛見眾生，即是魔外。	As for the meaning of attendants, if there are beings with attachment and views in the three lands, they are demons and outsiders.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a27_12']	淨名轉用，即為佛事利益眾生，即是侍義。	淨名轉用，即為佛事利益眾生，即是侍義。	Vimalakīrti transforms and uses them to perform Buddha's work and benefit beings, which is the meaning of attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a28_12']	若三土愛見眾生即空無所有者，是無侍義。	若三土愛見眾生即空無所有者，是無侍義。	If the beings with attachment and views in the three lands are empty and nonexistent, then there is no meaning of attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659a29_17']	而淨名為三土皆有愛見眾生，故現居諸土，即有侍也。	而淨名為三土皆有愛見眾生，故現居諸土，即有侍也。	But since Vimalakīrti is for the beings with attachment and views in the three lands, he manifests dwelling in the various lands, so there are attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b01_20']	若同居穢土，即有波旬眷屬及屬愛眾生，是右面侍；	若同居穢土，即有波旬眷屬及屬愛眾生，是右面侍；	If in the defiled land of the Land of Equal Enlightenment, there are Māra's retinue and beings attached to desire, they are attendants on the right side;
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b02_16']	六師九十六種及屬見眾生，是左面侍。	六師九十六種及屬見眾生，是左面侍。	The six masters, ninety-six kinds, and beings attached to views are attendants on the left side.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b06_8']	所以然者，淨名同居穢土現種種身於愛不捨，或作魔王調其眷屬以為佛事於見不動，或作外道迴邪入正調其眷屬以為佛事，此即用愛見所成眾生為侍。	所以然者，淨名同居穢土現種種身於愛不捨，或作魔王調其眷屬以為佛事於見不動，或作外道迴邪入正調其眷屬以為佛事，此即用愛見所成眾生為侍。	The reason for this is that Vimalakīrti manifests various bodies in the defiled land of the Land of Equal Enlightenment, not abandoning those with desire. Sometimes he becomes Māra's king, taming his retinue and using it as Buddha's work, not moving for those with views. Sometimes he becomes a non-Buddhist, turning the deviant to enter the correct, taming his retinue and using it as Buddha's work. This then uses beings accomplished through desire and views as attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b07_4']	現同居淨土亦然，但無惡魔外。	現同居淨土亦然，但無惡魔外。	The same is true for the Pure Land of the realm of desire, except that there are no evil demons or outsiders.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b09_18']	若有餘土見愛者，二乘通教菩薩生彼有禪定智慧，禪定是愛性、智慧是見性，猶是愛見宿業罪垢，故不見如來清淨之土。	若有餘土見愛者，二乘通教菩薩生彼有禪定智慧，禪定是愛性、智慧是見性，猶是愛見宿業罪垢，故不見如來清淨之土。	If there are those in the Land of the Reward Body who have views and attachments, the two vehicles and the bodhisattvas of the Shared Teaching who are born there have dhyāna concentration and wisdom. Dhyāna concentration is the nature of attachment, and wisdom is the nature of views. They still have the karmic offenses and defilements of attachment and views, so they do not see the Tathāgata's pure land.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b11_3']	淨名應生同其愛見，調伏教化使為佛事，即是侍也。	淨名應生同其愛見，調伏教化使為佛事，即是侍也。	Vimalakīrti should be born there and adjust to their attachment and views to tame and transform them, causing them to do Buddha's work. This is being his attendant.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b12_17']	若別圓菩薩雖有福慧，未見佛性未斷無明，即是無為愛見，所成猶是魔外。	若別圓菩薩雖有福慧，未見佛性未斷無明，即是無為愛見，所成猶是魔外。	If the bodhisattvas of the Distinct Teaching and the Perfect Teaching have merit and wisdom, but have not yet seen Buddha-nature and have not yet severed ignorance, this is still the attachment and views created by non-action. They are still demons and outsiders.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b14_15']	其變易土雖無天魔，而有樂生死魔，以染涅槃即是愛，愛故則有變易果報，即是魔也。	其變易土雖無天魔，而有樂生死魔，以染涅槃即是愛，愛故則有變易果報，即是魔也。	Although the Land of Transformation does not have celestial demons, it has the demon of delighting in birth and death. Being attached to nirvāṇa is attachment. Because of attachment, there is the retribution of transformation. This is the demon.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b15_13']	雖無真諦理外外道，而有中道理外外道。	雖無真諦理外外道，而有中道理外外道。	Although there are no non-Buddhist paths outside the truth of ultimate emptiness, there are non-Buddhist paths outside the truth of the Middle Way.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b16_16']	大士於愛不捨、於見不動而化度之，即以此為侍。	大士於愛不捨、於見不動而化度之，即以此為侍。	The great being does not abandon those who are attached, and does not move those who have views, but transforms and delivers them, and takes them as attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b19_10']	若果報土，始從初住雖見實諦圓斷法界見思，但未能盡，乃至法雲猶有細微愛見，故為無我輪惑所縛，餘一品死魔在。	若果報土，始從初住雖見實諦圓斷法界見思，但未能盡，乃至法雲猶有細微愛見，故為無我輪惑所縛，餘一品死魔在。	If it is the reward land, starting from the initial stage of abiding, although one sees the truth and completely eliminates the views and thoughts of the Dharma realm, one is still unable to completely eliminate them, and even up to the cloud of Dharma there are still subtle attachments and views, therefore one is bound by the wheel of ignorance and the delusion of selflessness, and the remaining one category of the demon of death is present.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b21_1']	淨名為此現生其土，調此愛見所成菩薩以為眷屬，即是皆吾侍也。	淨名為此現生其土，調此愛見所成菩薩以為眷屬，即是皆吾侍也。	Vimalakīrti manifests birth in that land for this reason, and adjusts those bodhisattvas who are formed by attachment and views as his retinue, which is precisely taking them all as his attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b22_17']	若究竟寂光，諸業所感依報永盡，故言空無所有，永無愛見所感正報，故言無侍。	若究竟寂光，諸業所感依報永盡，故言空無所有，永無愛見所感正報，故言無侍。	If it is the ultimate quiescent light, the dependent reward that is affected by various karmas is completely exhausted, therefore it is said to be empty and nonexistent. Forever without the correct reward that is affected by attachment and views, therefore it is said to be without attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b23_7']	空室無侍，遠表此也。	空室無侍，遠表此也。	The empty room and no attendants, from afar this is what is indicated.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b23_19']	「所以至不動」，二、釋。	「所以至不動」，二、釋。	The reason... second, the explanation.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b25_3']	如同居土以愛見魔外為侍者，三土愛見所成眾生亦皆名侍。	如同居土以愛見魔外為侍者，三土愛見所成眾生亦皆名侍。	It is like in the same dwelling land taking the demons of attachment and views as attendants, the sentient beings of the three lands who are formed by attachment and views are all called attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b25_19']	若愛見即空、不捨不動，即是無侍。	若愛見即空、不捨不動，即是無侍。	If one's love and views are empty, not abandoned, and unmoving, then there is no attendant.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b27_14']	即空而有愛見眾生，淨名不滯不捨不動而調伏之，令具一切佛法，即有侍義。	即空而有愛見眾生，淨名不滯不捨不動而調伏之，令具一切佛法，即有侍義。	Yet there are sentient beings with love and views who are empty, and Vimalakīrti does not dwell in, abandon, or move them, but tames them and causes them to be endowed with all Buddha-dharmas, which is the meaning of having attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b28_12']	寂光永無愛見，即無魔外，故無侍也。	寂光永無愛見，即無魔外，故無侍也。	In the eternally quiescent and illuminated, there is forever no love or views, so there are no demons or outsiders, and thus no attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b29_3']	「文殊」下，三、文殊問疾相。	「文殊」下，三、文殊問疾相。	Mañjuśrī - third, Mañjuśrī's appearance in asking about the illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659b29_9']	有三番問答：	有三番問答：	There are three rounds of questions and answers:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c01_6']	一問疾體相、二問疾用、三問成疾之法。	一問疾體相、二問疾用、三問成疾之法。	First, asking about the characteristics of the illness; second, asking about the function of the illness; third, asking about the method of creating the illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c02_3']	初問言「所疾為何等相」，即問疾體相。	初問言「所疾為何等相」，即問疾體相。	The first question says, What are the characteristics of the illness? - this is asking about the characteristics of the illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c03_16']	所以問者，既言法身眾患永斷，因於大悲現斯疾者，悲即疾體，有何等相？	所以問者，既言法身眾患永斷，因於大悲現斯疾者，悲即疾體，有何等相？	The reason for asking is that since it is said that the Dharma body eternally cuts off all afflictions, and the manifestation of this illness is due to great compassion, compassion is the essence of the illness, what are its characteristics?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c04_15']	若有定相則能利益，若無定相豈能有用？	若有定相則能利益，若無定相豈能有用？	If there are definite characteristics, then it can bring benefit. If there are no definite characteristics, how can it have a function?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c06_7']	淨名答言「我病無形不可見」，此明法身本來無疾，大悲善根而現此疾。	淨名答言「我病無形不可見」，此明法身本來無疾，大悲善根而現此疾。	Vimalakīrti replied, My illness has no form and cannot be seen. This clarifies that the Dharma body is originally free from illness, and this illness is manifested by the wholesome roots of great compassion.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c07_2']	無緣大悲無有處所，豈有形相？	無緣大悲無有處所，豈有形相？	The great compassion without conditions has no location, so how can there be form and appearance?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c08_11']	若眾生緣、法緣有所依倚可辨其相，同體大悲無緣無念豈有可見？	若眾生緣、法緣有所依倚可辨其相，同體大悲無緣無念豈有可見？	If the compassion with conditions, such as the compassion for sentient beings and the compassion for dharmas, has something to rely on, then its characteristics can be discerned. But the great compassion of the same essence, without conditions and without thought, how can it be seen?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c08_17']	如磁石吸鐵。	如磁石吸鐵。	It is like a magnet attracting iron.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c09_18']	如凡夫身患尚無相貌，況法身無緣而有可見？	如凡夫身患尚無相貌，況法身無緣而有可見？	If the body of ordinary beings has illness but still has no appearance, how much more so is the Dharma body without conditions and yet visible?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c10_17']	故答言我病無形不可見，即是答疾體也。	故答言我病無形不可見，即是答疾體也。	Therefore, the answer says, My illness has no form and cannot be seen, which is the answer to the essence of the illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c11_14']	「又問至如幻故」，二、問疾用。	「又問至如幻故」，二、問疾用。	He also asked, 'Why is it like an illusion?' Second, asking about the function of the illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c12_16']	所以問疾用者，應身權疾即是病用，進退二種與何法合？	所以問疾用者，應身權疾即是病用，進退二種與何法合？	The reason for asking about the function of the illness is that the expedient illness of the responsive body is precisely the function of the illness. Whether advancing or retreating, it is of two kinds, with which dharma does it correspond?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c13_12']	為與金剛身合、為與智慧心合？	為與金剛身合、為與智慧心合？	Does it correspond with the vajra body or does it correspond with the wisdom mind?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c14_4']	若與身合，法身應有其疾。	若與身合，法身應有其疾。	If it corresponds with the body, then the Dharma body should have illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c14_18']	若與心合，力無畏等心應有苦。	若與心合，力無畏等心應有苦。	If it were to unite with the mind, then the powers, fearlessnesses, and so forth would have suffering.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c15_6']	此約進合義問也。	此約進合義問也。	This question is based on the meaning of advancing union.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c16_13']	所以約金剛為色、智慧為心者，出《大經》佛答師子吼也。	所以約金剛為色、智慧為心者，出《大經》佛答師子吼也。	The reason for taking vajra as form and wisdom as mind comes from the Buddha's answer to the Lion's Roar in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c17_12']	若與眾生身合，眾生身實有疾，應身應實有疾。	若與眾生身合，眾生身實有疾，應身應實有疾。	If it were to unite with the bodies of sentient beings, and the bodies of sentient beings actually have illness, then the bodies of the responsive manifestations should actually have illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c18_13']	若與眾生心合，眾生心有實苦，應心應有實苦。	若與眾生心合，眾生心有實苦，應心應有實苦。	If it were to unite with the minds of sentient beings, and the minds of sentient beings have actual suffering, then the minds of the responsive manifestations should have actual suffering.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c19_2']	此約退合義問也。	此約退合義問也。	This question is based on the meaning of retreating union.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c20_6']	若不與金剛身、智慧心合，云何名法身起應從大悲生？	若不與金剛身、智慧心合，云何名法身起應從大悲生？	If it does not unite with the vajra body and wisdom mind, how can it be said that the Dharma body gives rise to responsive manifestations born from great compassion?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c21_6']	若不與眾生身心合者，云何而言應同其疾？	若不與眾生身心合者，云何而言應同其疾？	If it does not unite with the bodies and minds of sentient beings, how can it be said that it responds by being the same as their illnesses?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c21_21']	淨名答言「非身合，身相離故」。	淨名答言「非身合，身相離故」。	Vimalakīrti's answer says, It is not a union of bodies, because the characteristics of bodies are separate.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c23_16']	如凡夫病，現見不與身心而合，推假名身不見實疾但有名字，名字不論合與不合。	如凡夫病，現見不與身心而合，推假名身不見實疾但有名字，名字不論合與不合。	It is like an ordinary person's illness. It is presently seen not to be combined with the body and mind. Investigating the provisional name body, one does not see a real illness, but only a name. The name does not discuss whether it is combined or not combined.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c24_13']	身相離故求實不得，故病不與身合。	身相離故求實不得，故病不與身合。	Because the characteristics of the body are separated, seeking the reality cannot be obtained. Therefore, the illness is not combined with the body.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c25_7']	亦非心合，心如幻故念念不住。	亦非心合，心如幻故念念不住。	It is also not combined with the mind. Because the mind is like an illusion, it does not abide moment by moment.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0659c26_7']	豈況應身權疾，而與金剛身合，身相離故；	豈況應身權疾，而與金剛身合，身相離故；	How much more so for the expedient illness of the response body, which is combined with the vajra body, because the characteristics of the body are separated;

['ZH_T38_1778_007:0660a02_10']	雖不與鏡合，因鏡像現。	雖不與鏡合，因鏡像現。	Although it is not combined with the mirror, the forms and appearances appear due to the mirror.

['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b17_9']	前明〈問疾品〉約於權疾辨果、實疾明因。	前明〈問疾品〉約於權疾辨果、實疾明因。	Previously, the Chapter on Asking about Illness was explained in terms of the provisional illness to discern the fruition, and the actual illness to clarify the causes.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b19_15']	所說既略，利根之徒如八千天子已發道心，其未悟之流更廣辨果明因，決前權實疾義，故次來也。	所說既略，利根之徒如八千天子已發道心，其未悟之流更廣辨果明因，決前權實疾義，故次來也。	Since what was explained was brief, the sharp-witted ones, like the eight thousand sons of heaven, had already given rise to the aspiration for enlightenment. Those who had not yet awakened were further broadly explained about the fruition and causes, resolving the meaning of the provisional and actual illnesses from before, and thus came next.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b20_1']	此五品為二：	此五品為二：	These five chapters are divided into two parts:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b20_20']	一、此品正為決前〈問疾品〉約權疾明果；	一、此品正為決前〈問疾品〉約權疾明果；	First, this chapter directly resolves the Chapter on Asking about Illness in terms of the provisional illness to clarify the fruition;
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b22_15']	二、從〈觀眾生品〉至〈香積〉四品，正為決前〈問疾品〉約實疾明三教慰喻、三觀調伏之因。	二、從〈觀眾生品〉至〈香積〉四品，正為決前〈問疾品〉約實疾明三教慰喻、三觀調伏之因。	Second, from the Chapter on Contemplating Sentient Beings to the Chapter on Fragrant Accumulation, it is mainly to resolve the previous Chapter on Inquiring about Illness and clarify the causes of consolation through the three teachings and the three contemplations in subduing afflictions.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b23_6']	今略用三意通釋此品：	今略用三意通釋此品：	Now, I will briefly use three meanings to explain this chapter:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b24_4']	一品來意、二略釋不思議、三入文帖釋。	一品來意、二略釋不思議、三入文帖釋。	The first is the purpose of the chapter, second is a brief explanation of the inconceivable, and third is the detailed explanation of the text.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b24_20']	初來意者，〈問疾品〉明疾有權實。	初來意者，〈問疾品〉明疾有權實。	As for the first purpose, the Chapter on Inquiring about Illness clarifies that illness has provisional and real aspects.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b25_15']	權疾即是法身應用，本迹各有所居。	權疾即是法身應用，本迹各有所居。	The provisional illness is the response of the Dharma body, each with its own abode.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b26_15']	故淨名空室現疾而臥，表土表身表本表迹。	故淨名空室現疾而臥，表土表身表本表迹。	Therefore, Vimalakīrti's empty room, manifesting illness and lying down, represents the land, the body, the origin, and the traces.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b27_16']	文殊覩相知有所表，故因往復論決果地依正。	文殊覩相知有所表，故因往復論決果地依正。	Mañjuśrī observed the signs and knew what they represented, so he went to discuss and resolve the fruition ground's dependence on the correct.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667b29_17']	義意雖顯，而不思議垂迹權疾依正莫測之用猶未具明，故因身子生念，為致燈王之座。	義意雖顯，而不思議垂迹權疾依正莫測之用猶未具明，故因身子生念，為致燈王之座。	Although the meaning is evident, the inconceivable use of the traces of the provisional illness and dependence on the correct has not yet been fully explained, so he caused Śāriputra to give rise to thoughts and bring the seat of the Lamp King.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c01_8']	而此小室容多大座而無妨礙，即顯不思議垂迹權疾所居神用莫測。	而此小室容多大座而無妨礙，即顯不思議垂迹權疾所居神用莫測。	Yet this small room can accommodate many large seats without obstruction, which reveals the inconceivable spiritual function of the manifestation of illness by the trace.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c03_13']	廣論果地從本起迹，迹中變用依正自在，重廣顯權疾垂迹變現，眾生疾愈權疾亦愈，故此品來也。	廣論果地從本起迹，迹中變用依正自在，重廣顯權疾垂迹變現，眾生疾愈權疾亦愈，故此品來也。	The extensive discussion of the fruition ground arising from the root and the freely transforming and utilizing of the traces in the Dharma realm is further revealed. The manifestation of illness by the trace is extensively revealed, and when sentient beings are cured, the illness of the trace is also cured. Therefore, this chapter comes.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c04_7']	二、略釋不思議者，即有二意：	二、略釋不思議者，即有二意：	Second, the brief explanation of the inconceivable has two meanings:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c05_7']	一明三德解脫不思議、二明本迹依土不思議。	一明三德解脫不思議、二明本迹依土不思議。	First, clarifying the inconceivable liberation of the three virtues; second, clarifying the inconceivable fundamental trace-dependent land.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c05_15']	初意者即有三種：	初意者即有三種：	The first meaning has three kinds:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c06_7']	一真性、二實慧、三方便。	一真性、二實慧、三方便。	First, true nature; second, real wisdom; third, skillful means.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c09_7']	故淨名云「諸佛菩薩有解脫名不思議」，若菩薩住是解脫者，能以須彌之高廣內芥子中，乃至種種變現莫測，即是三種解脫不思議義。	故淨名云「諸佛菩薩有解脫名不思議」，若菩薩住是解脫者，能以須彌之高廣內芥子中，乃至種種變現莫測，即是三種解脫不思議義。	Therefore, Vimalakīrti says, The buddhas and bodhisattvas have a liberation called inconceivable. If a bodhisattva abides in this liberation, he can place the lofty and vast Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed... up to various freely transforming manifestations beyond comprehension, which is the meaning of the inconceivability of the three kinds of liberation.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c09_10']	何者？	何者？	What is it?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c11_9']	諸佛菩薩有解脫者即是真性，若菩薩住此者即是實慧，能以須彌內於芥等即是方便。	諸佛菩薩有解脫者即是真性，若菩薩住此者即是實慧，能以須彌內於芥等即是方便。	The liberation of buddhas and bodhisattvas is the true nature. If bodhisattvas abide in this, it is true wisdom. Being able to place Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed, etc., is skillful means.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c12_12']	但四教皆明三種之理悉有不思議義，而有二種：	但四教皆明三種之理悉有不思議義，而有二種：	But the four teachings all clarify the three kinds of principles, all of which have the meaning of the inconceivable. There are two kinds:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c12_20']	一相待、二絕待。	一相待、二絕待。	1. Relative, 2. Absolute.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c13_9']	若三教所明即是相待。	若三教所明即是相待。	If the three teachings that are clarified are relative.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c13_12']	何者？	何者？	What is it?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c14_12']	三教隨他意語，約斷結以明解脫，即是相待。	三教隨他意語，約斷結以明解脫，即是相待。	The three teachings follow the expedient teachings of others, and clarify liberation based on severing afflictions, which is relative.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c15_15']	圓教隨自，約不斷結以明解脫，即是絕待不思議也。	圓教隨自，約不斷結以明解脫，即是絕待不思議也。	The perfect teaching follows itself, and clarifies liberation based on not severing afflictions, which is absolute and inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c16_11']	相待即是有思之不思，皆是思議。	相待即是有思之不思，皆是思議。	The relative is the inconceivable that involves thought, and is all conceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c17_8']	絕待即是無思之不思，是真不思議。	絕待即是無思之不思，是真不思議。	The absolute is the inconceivable that does not involve thought, and is the true inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c18_6']	今此一品，正以絕待不思以釋不思議也。	今此一品，正以絕待不思以釋不思議也。	This chapter correctly uses the absolute inconceivable to explain the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c20_18']	所以三教成相待者，如三藏佛果神用變化，凡夫二乘及諸菩薩之所莫測即不思議，若待通教體法解脫還是思議。	所以三教成相待者，如三藏佛果神用變化，凡夫二乘及諸菩薩之所莫測即不思議，若待通教體法解脫還是思議。	Therefore, the three teachings form a relative relationship. For example, the spiritual functions and transformations of the Buddha's fruition in the Tripiṭaka are incomprehensible to ordinary beings, the two vehicles, and bodhisattvas, so they are inconceivable. If the essence of dharmas and liberation in the Shared Teaching are still conceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c22_15']	若通教八地已上道觀雙流，二乘下地之所莫測即不思議，若待佛地猶是思議。	若通教八地已上道觀雙流，二乘下地之所莫測即不思議，若待佛地猶是思議。	If the eighth ground and above in the Shared Teaching simultaneously flow in both the path and contemplation, they are incomprehensible to the two vehicles and lower grounds, so they are inconceivable. If compared to the Buddha ground, they are still conceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c25_6']	通若待別還是思議，別教登地見一實諦得三解脫，三乘通教別三十心所不測量即不思議，若待上地是思議。	通若待別還是思議，別教登地見一實諦得三解脫，三乘通教別三十心所不測量即不思議，若待上地是思議。	If the Shared Teaching is compared to the Distinct Teaching, it is still conceivable. In the Distinct Teaching, the ground of seeing the one true reality and attaining the three liberations is incomprehensible to the three vehicles, the Shared Teaching, and the thirty minds of the Distinct Teaching, so it is inconceivable. If compared to the higher grounds, it is conceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0667c26_7']	此三皆是下不思上，非是當位絕待之不思議。	此三皆是下不思上，非是當位絕待之不思議。	These three are all the lower not being able to conceive the higher, but not the inconceivability of the absolute transcendence within one's own stage.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a01_6']	今明圓教絕待不思議者，十二因緣三種非道即是三德解脫佛道，若菩薩行此十二因緣三種非道，不斷三惑不破三法而住三種解脫之道，即不思議絕待三德之解脫也。	今明圓教絕待不思議者，十二因緣三種非道即是三德解脫佛道，若菩薩行此十二因緣三種非道，不斷三惑不破三法而住三種解脫之道，即不思議絕待三德之解脫也。	Now, in explaining the inconceivable of the perfect teaching beyond comparison, the twelve links of dependent arising and the three kinds of non-dharmas are precisely the three virtues of liberation and the Buddha way. If bodhisattvas practice these twelve links of dependent arising and the three kinds of non-dharmas, without cutting off the three delusions and breaking the three dharmas, and abide in the way of the three kinds of liberation, then it is the inconceivable liberation of the three virtues beyond comparison.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a03_10']	是則非但下不思上，乃至上地諸佛菩薩亦不思下地及一切眾生因緣三道，即是絕待之不思議。	是則非但下不思上，乃至上地諸佛菩薩亦不思下地及一切眾生因緣三道，即是絕待之不思議。	This means that not only is the lower not thought of by the higher, but even the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the higher stages do not think of the lower stages and all sentient beings' three paths of dependent arising, which is the inconceivable beyond comparison.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a04_14']	故《文殊般若》云「佛界眾生界俱不可思議，無有異也。	故《文殊般若》云「佛界眾生界俱不可思議，無有異也。	Therefore, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says, The buddha realm and the realm of sentient beings are both inconceivable, without distinction.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a05_12']	」前釋「一名不可思議解脫」，已具明竟。	」前釋「一名不可思議解脫」，已具明竟。	The previous explanation of one is called inconceivable liberation has already been fully clarified.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a07_5']	二、約本迹依土者，前品空室表土，文殊見相問於佛國，但明寂光畢竟空寂。	二、約本迹依土者，前品空室表土，文殊見相問於佛國，但明寂光畢竟空寂。	Second, regarding the basis and traces according to the land, the previous chapter uses an empty room to symbolize the land. Mañjuśrī sees the signs and asks about the buddha land, but only clarifies the ultimate emptiness and stillness of the reward land.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a08_9']	此但是法身本土不可思議，未顯應身迹居不思議相。	此但是法身本土不可思議，未顯應身迹居不思議相。	This is merely the inconceivable native land of the Dharma body, not yet manifesting the traces of the responsive body dwelling in the inconceivable characteristics.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a11_15']	今用神力致座，明迹居穢土現不思議事，須彌大海地水火風十方佛土集在一國，示一切人如是等事，皆是依土現不思議莫測之相，具出在文。	今用神力致座，明迹居穢土現不思議事，須彌大海地水火風十方佛土集在一國，示一切人如是等事，皆是依土現不思議莫測之相，具出在文。	Now using spiritual power to bring forth the seat, it clarifies that the traces dwell in the defiled land and manifest inconceivable events. Mount Sumeru, the great ocean, earth, water, fire, wind, and the buddha lands of the ten directions are gathered in one country, showing all people such events, all of which are the inconceivable and unfathomable characteristics manifested by relying on the land. They are all fully presented in the text.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a13_1']	若迹居分段，依報塊然，尚示無礙，居餘三土豈可測量？	若迹居分段，依報塊然，尚示無礙，居餘三土豈可測量？	If the traces dwell in the segmented, the material of the dependent recompense still manifests unobstructedness. How could it be fathomed to dwell in the other three lands?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a13_3']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a13_19']	此十四品皆不思議，何得獨標此品？	此十四品皆不思議，何得獨標此品？	All fourteen chapters are inconceivable. Why is this chapter alone singled out?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a13_21']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a14_19']	雖復皆明，但此品廣出變用事顯，故別標題。	雖復皆明，但此品廣出變用事顯，故別標題。	Although they all clarify, only this chapter extensively presents the transformed functions and events are evident, so it is separately titled.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a16_10']	如摩訶般若始終皆明般若，佛言欲求般若當於〈須菩提品〉中求。	如摩訶般若始終皆明般若，佛言欲求般若當於〈須菩提品〉中求。	Just as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra throughout clarifies prajñā, the Buddha said, If you seek prajñā, you should seek it in the Subhūti Chapter.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a18_9']	而須菩提對佛、釋提桓因、舍利弗問難，一向皆入真空實相，即般若正意，故勸此品中求。	而須菩提對佛、釋提桓因、舍利弗問難，一向皆入真空實相，即般若正意，故勸此品中求。	And Subhūti, in response to the Buddha, Śakra Devānām-Indra, and Śāriputra's questions, all entered into the true emptiness and reality, which is the main point of prajñā, and therefore this chapter is encouraged to be sought.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a18_14']	今品亦爾。	今品亦爾。	Now this chapter is also like this.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a19_4']	「爾時」下，三、入文帖釋。	「爾時」下，三、入文帖釋。	At that time and below, third, the text is used to explain.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a19_10']	此品總為六：	此品總為六：	This chapter is generally divided into six parts:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a21_11']	一身子為眾念座、二淨名借座、三昧不思議神用、四迦葉欣仰、五時眾得益、六淨名述成。	一身子為眾念座、二淨名借座、三昧不思議神用、四迦葉欣仰、五時眾得益、六淨名述成。	First, Śāriputra thinks of a seat for the assembly; second, Vimalakīrti borrows a seat; third, the inconceivable spiritual function of samādhi; fourth, Kāśyapa looks up in admiration; fifth, the assembly benefits; sixth, Vimalakīrti praises.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a21_16']	初文為五：	初文為五：	The first text is divided into five parts:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a23_5']	一身子生念、二淨名問、三身子答、四淨名彈呵、五天子得法眼淨。	一身子生念、二淨名問、三身子答、四淨名彈呵、五天子得法眼淨。	First, Śāriputra has thoughts; second, Vimalakīrti asks; third, Śāriputra answers; fourth, Vimalakīrti's rebuke; fifth, the celestial sons attain the pure Dharma eye.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a24_7']	初文者，身子古聖，迹示此念，欲為開發不思議端。	初文者，身子古聖，迹示此念，欲為開發不思議端。	The first text is that Śāriputra, an ancient sage, shows this thought in traces, wishing to reveal the beginning of the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a25_2']	若不生念，無由得顯不思議用。	若不生念，無由得顯不思議用。	If he did not have thoughts, there would be no way to manifest the inconceivable function.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a27_13']	又欲為令小乘未證果者得法眼淨，或發大心已入位者得成生蘇，故示生念，因致彈呵，為借燈王之座廣說大用。	又欲為令小乘未證果者得法眼淨，或發大心已入位者得成生蘇，故示生念，因致彈呵，為借燈王之座廣說大用。	Moreover, he wished to cause those of the Lesser Vehicle who had not yet realized the fruits to attain the purity of the Dharma eye, or to give rise to the great mind and enter the stage, and to transform them into ripened curd, so he manifested this thought, which led to the reprimand, and borrowed the seat of King Lamp Lighter to extensively explain the great function.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668a28_15']	則諸聲聞鄙小慕大，堪聞《大品》、《法華》。	則諸聲聞鄙小慕大，堪聞《大品》、《法華》。	Then the śrāvakas despised the small and admired the great, and were able to hear the Great Perfection of Wisdom and the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b01_4']	約事論者，大眾立久，而二大士方論大道，言論未已，恐時眾疲怠不染法利。	約事論者，大眾立久，而二大士方論大道，言論未已，恐時眾疲怠不染法利。	As for discussing it in terms of events, the great assembly had been seated for a long time, while the two great beings were just discussing the great way. The discussion had not yet ended, and he feared that the assembly would become tired and not be receptive to the benefits of the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b02_3']	若有床座，咸得安穩，必獲大益，故生此念。	若有床座，咸得安穩，必獲大益，故生此念。	If there were seats, they would all be comfortable and would certainly gain great benefits, so he gave rise to this thought.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b02_13']	亦因空室，致有斯念。	亦因空室，致有斯念。	He also gave rise to this thought because of the empty room.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b03_15']	因此彈呵，神力借座，即得廣說不思議解脫神用。	因此彈呵，神力借座，即得廣說不思議解脫神用。	Because of this reprimand, he borrowed the seat through spiritual power, and was then able to extensively explain the inconceivable liberation and spiritual function.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b04_9']	皆是垂迹權疾利物自在之功。	皆是垂迹權疾利物自在之功。	All of this is the power of the traces of the skillful means of benefiting beings through the power of spiritual freedom.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b05_14']	若有此勝能用化物者，則除眾生實疾因果豈得不念？	若有此勝能用化物者，則除眾生實疾因果豈得不念？	If there is this superior ability to transform beings, then he would eliminate the causes and effects of the real illness of sentient beings. How could he not give rise to this thought?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b07_8']	若眾生因果疾愈，則佛菩薩淨名應同之疾皆愈，是則成前果地權疾之義。	若眾生因果疾愈，則佛菩薩淨名應同之疾皆愈，是則成前果地權疾之義。	If the causes and effects of sentient beings are quickly cured, then the pure names of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas should be the same as their illnesses being cured. This is the meaning of the previous provisional illness of the fruition ground.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b08_1']	「長者至床座耶」，二、問所念。	「長者至床座耶」，二、問所念。	The elder came to the bed and seat? Second, asking about what was thought.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b08_14']	身子雖生此念，眾生未盡知。	身子雖生此念，眾生未盡知。	Although Śāriputra had this thought, sentient beings did not yet fully understand.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b09_14']	將欲彈呵，故先問所念「為法來耶求床座耶」。	將欲彈呵，故先問所念「為法來耶求床座耶」。	He was about to rebuke, so he first asked about what was thought, Did you come for the Dharma or to seek a bed and seat?
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b10_3']	若為床座，不名行人。	若為床座，不名行人。	If it was for a bed and seat, it would not be called practicing.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b10_13']	若言為法，不應求座。	若言為法，不應求座。	If it was said to be for the Dharma, one should not seek a seat.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b10_18']	故須覈問。	故須覈問。	Therefore, it was necessary to investigate and ask.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b11_14']	若所念顯露，大眾同知，方可彈折。	若所念顯露，大眾同知，方可彈折。	If what was thought was obvious, and the great assembly knew it together, then it could be rebuked and corrected.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b12_12']	「舍利至求床座」，三、身子依念而答。	「舍利至求床座」，三、身子依念而答。	Śāriputra said, 'I seek a bed and seat.' Third, Śāriputra relied on his thoughts to answer.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b13_8']	「我為法來非為床座」，尋此答意即為三失：	「我為法來非為床座」，尋此答意即為三失：	I came for the Dharma, not for a bed and seat. Following this answer, there are immediately three faults:
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b14_5']	一、心念床座而云為法，是違心之失。	一、心念床座而云為法，是違心之失。	First, thinking of a bed and seat in the mind, but saying it is for the Dharma, is the fault of contradicting one's mind.
['ZH_T38_1778_007:0668b15_8']	二、所念聲聞法中三寶四諦等法，是不稱理之失。	二、所念聲聞法中三寶四諦等法，是不稱理之失。	Second, the mindfulness of the Dharma of the śrāvakas, such as the Three Jewels and Four Truths, is the fault of not conforming to principle.

The aggregates and sense bases are his retribution body. Based on this, he cultivates meditation and gives rise to the concentrations of the desire realm, the four meditations, and the four formless [absorptions]. Abiding in these various meditations, he contemplates the principle of the arising and cessation of the aggregates and sense bases in the three realms and severs the bonds of the three realms. Although he becomes an arhat, he still cycles through contemplating the impurities and returns to this [realm] to enter [nirvāṇa].

Therefore, it is criticized that one should not grasp at the provisional teachings and take the thirty-two marks as the Buddha, the nine divisions of the canon as the Dharma, and the precepts obtained through karman as the Saṅgha of affairs, and the fruits of seeing the truth as the Saṅgha of principle.

It is like reprimanding Kātyāyana, saying do not use a mind that arises and ceases to speak of the Dharma of reality.
