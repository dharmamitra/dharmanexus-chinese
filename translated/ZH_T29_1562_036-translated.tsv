['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b15_18']	4 四辯業品第四之四已辯業門略有二種，謂思、思已業差別故。	4 四辯業品第四之四已辯業門略有二種，謂思、思已業差別故。	036	Chapter 4, section 4: The four kinds of eloquence, the fourth part of the fourth chapter on the topic of karma. It has been explained that karma is roughly of two kinds, namely volition and post-volition, due to the distinction between karma and post-karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b16_12']	復有三種，謂身語意業差別故。	復有三種，謂身語意業差別故。	036	There are also three kinds, namely bodily, verbal, and mental karma, due to the distinction between bodily, verbal, and mental karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b17_15']	復有五種，謂身語二各表無表，及思惟一業差別故。	復有五種，謂身語二各表無表，及思惟一業差別故。	036	There are also five kinds, namely bodily, verbal, and mental karma, and the distinction between bodily and verbal karma.

['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b19_0']	無表記餘三，　　不善唯在欲，	無表記餘三，　　不善唯在欲，	036	Non-indication is the other three. Unskillful [karma] is only in the desire realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b20_0']	無表遍欲色，　　表唯有伺二，	無表遍欲色，　　表唯有伺二，	036	Non-indication is found in the desire and form realms. Indication is only in the two realms with investigation.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b21_13']	欲無有覆表，　　以無等起故。	欲無有覆表，　　以無等起故。	036	In the desire realm, there is no non-revealing [karma] with obstruction, because there is no motivation.

['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b22_16']	無表唯通善不善性，無有無記。	無表唯通善不善性，無有無記。	036	Non-indicative karma only has the nature of being skillful or unskillful, and there is no indeterminate [karma].
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b23_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	036	Why is this so?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b23_10']	是強力心所等起故。	是強力心所等起故。	036	Because it is produced by powerful mind and mental factors.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b25_7']	無記心劣，無有功能為因等起引強力業，令於後後餘心位中，及無心時亦恒續起。	無記心劣，無有功能為因等起引強力業，令於後後餘心位中，及無心時亦恒續起。	036	The indeterminate mind is weak and has no power to cause the arising of a powerful action that is its cause, and to make it continue to arise in the subsequent states of other minds and in the states of unconsciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b26_10']	所言餘者，謂二表及思三，謂皆通善、不善、無記。	所言餘者，謂二表及思三，謂皆通善、不善、無記。	036	The remaining three, namely, the two kinds of revealing and volition, are all of three kinds, good, bad, and indeterminate.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b27_7']	於中不善在欲非餘，有不善根無慚愧故。	於中不善在欲非餘，有不善根無慚愧故。	036	Bad volition exists in the realm of desire and not elsewhere, because there is no root of demerit, shamelessness, and lack of conscience.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545b28_8']	善及無記隨其所應，三界皆有，不別遮故。	善及無記隨其所應，三界皆有，不別遮故。	036	Good and indeterminate are found in the three realms as appropriate, because there is no specific prohibition.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c01_16']	欲色二界皆有無表，決定不在無色界中，以無色界中有伏色想故，厭背諸色入無色定，故彼定中不能生色。	欲色二界皆有無表，決定不在無色界中，以無色界中有伏色想故，厭背諸色入無色定，故彼定中不能生色。	036	Both revealing and nonrevealing exist in the realms of desire and form, but definitely not in the formless realm, because in the formless realm there is the subduing of the notion of form. One enters the formless concentrations because one is disgusted with form and turns one’s back on it. Therefore one cannot generate form in those concentrations.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c02_15']	或隨何處有身語轉，唯是處有身語律儀。	或隨何處有身語轉，唯是處有身語律儀。	036	Or, wherever there is the occurrence of bodily and vocal action, there is the restraint of body and speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c03_1']	有作是言：	有作是言：	036	There is an opinion that
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c03_14']	以無色界無大種故無無表色。	以無色界無大種故無無表色。	036	because the formless realm has no material elements, there is no nonrevealing form there.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c04_13']	彼但能遮有漏無表，無漏無表無理能遮。	彼但能遮有漏無表，無漏無表無理能遮。	036	They can only prevent impure non-manifest karma, but there is no reason to prevent pure non-manifest karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c06_14']	謂無色中無大種故，墮界繫地有漏律儀，必定無容是別界地大種所造，故無色無無漏律儀。	謂無色中無大種故，墮界繫地有漏律儀，必定無容是別界地大種所造，故無色無無漏律儀。	036	This is because in the formless realm there are no primary elements. The impure restraint that falls into the realms, stages, and grounds definitely does not allow for being produced by the primary elements of other realms and stages. Therefore there is no pure restraint in the formless realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c07_17']	既許得為別界別地大種所造，無色界有何理能遮？	既許得為別界別地大種所造，無色界有何理能遮？	036	Since it is allowed to be produced by the primary elements of other realms and stages, what principle in the formless realm can prevent it?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c08_7']	是故前說於理無過。	是故前說於理無過。	036	Therefore the previous explanation is without fault.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c08_16']	毘婆沙師作如是說：	毘婆沙師作如是說：	036	The Vaibhāṣikas say:
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c09_6']	為治惡戒故起尸羅。	為治惡戒故起尸羅。	036	Restraint is produced in order to counteract immorality.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c11_4']	唯欲界中有諸惡戒，無色於欲具四種遠，一所依遠、二行相遠、三所緣遠、四對治遠。	唯欲界中有諸惡戒，無色於欲具四種遠，一所依遠、二行相遠、三所緣遠、四對治遠。	036	Only in the desire realm are there various kinds of immorality. The formless realm is four kinds of distance from the desire realm: 1. distance of basis, 2. distance of aspect, 3. distance of object, 4. distance of antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c12_12']	所依遠者，謂於等至入出位中，等無間緣為所依體，無容有故。	所依遠者，謂於等至入出位中，等無間緣為所依體，無容有故。	036	Distance of basis means that in the states of entering and exiting samādhi, the immediately preceding condition as the basis does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c14_1']	行相遠者，謂無色心畢竟無能於欲界法作苦麁等諸行相故。	行相遠者，謂無色心畢竟無能於欲界法作苦麁等諸行相故。	036	As for the difference in mode of activity, the formless mind is absolutely incapable of taking the dharmas of the realm of desire as objects and activating the modes of activity of suffering, coarseness, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c15_17']	所緣遠義，類此應知，由無色心但能以下第四靜慮有漏諸法，為苦麁等行相所緣。	所緣遠義，類此應知，由無色心但能以下第四靜慮有漏諸法，為苦麁等行相所緣。	036	The meaning of difference in object should be understood in the same way as the difference in mode of activity. This is because the formless mind can only take the impure dharmas of the fourth trance state and below as objects in the modes of activity of suffering, coarseness, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c18_19']	對治遠者，謂若未離欲界貪時，必定無容起無色定，能為欲界惡戒等法厭壞及斷二對治故，非不能緣可能厭壞，故無色界無無表色。	對治遠者，謂若未離欲界貪時，必定無容起無色定，能為欲界惡戒等法厭壞及斷二對治故，非不能緣可能厭壞，故無色界無無表色。	036	As for the difference in antidote, if one has not yet eliminated the craving of the realm of desire, one is absolutely incapable of generating the formless concentrations that can be the two antidotes of disgust and destruction of the evil destinies, etc., of the realm of desire. It is not that the formless mind cannot take the realm of desire as an object, but it can only be disgusted with it. Therefore the formless realm has no nonmanifest form.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c20_7']	表色唯在二有伺地，謂通欲界初靜慮中，非上地中可言有表。	表色唯在二有伺地，謂通欲界初靜慮中，非上地中可言有表。	036	Manifest form exists only in the two stages with applied thought, i.e., the realm of desire and the first trance state, and not in the stages above that.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c21_6']	說有伺者，為顯一切初靜慮中遍有表業。	說有伺者，為顯一切初靜慮中遍有表業。	036	We speak of applied thought in order to show that all have manifest action in the first trance state.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c22_6']	若於上地表業全無，語表既無，何有聲處？	若於上地表業全無，語表既無，何有聲處？	036	If there is no manifest action in the stages above that, then speech is absent, and how can there be the sense base of sound?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c23_4']	有外大種為因發聲，不遮外聲，故無有失。	有外大種為因發聲，不遮外聲，故無有失。	036	The reason is that it is not denied that sound is produced by external great elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c23_9']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	036	Other masters say that
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c25_11']	上三靜慮亦有無覆無記表業，理必應爾，上三地中起三識身既無有失，如何不起發表業心？	上三靜慮亦有無覆無記表業，理必應爾，上三地中起三識身既無有失，如何不起發表業心？	036	in the three stages of trance there is also nondetermined action without moral influence. This must be so, because it is not a mistake to say that the three consciousnesses of the three stages of trance are produced. How is it that the mind that produces action does not arise?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c26_19']	然善染心上不起下，下善下染劣故斷故，由是生上無善染表。	然善染心上不起下，下善下染劣故斷故，由是生上無善染表。	036	However, a good mind or a defiled mind of a lower stage does not produce a good or defiled mind of a higher stage, because the lower is weak and the higher is severed. Consequently, there is no good or defiled action in the stages of trance.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c27_4']	前說為善。	前說為善。	036	The former explanation is correct.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c27_9']	所以者何？	所以者何？	036	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c27_19']	雖彼現前，非彼繫故。	雖彼現前，非彼繫故。	036	Even though the action is present, it is not bound to the stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0545c28_18']	有覆無記表欲界定無，唯初靜慮中可得說有。	有覆無記表欲界定無，唯初靜慮中可得說有。	036	Nondetermined action with moral influence does not exist in the realm of desire, but it is found in the first stage of trance.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a01_7']	曾聞大梵有誑諂言，謂自眾中為避馬勝所徵問故矯自歎等。	曾聞大梵有誑諂言，謂自眾中為避馬勝所徵問故矯自歎等。	036	It is said that the great brahma has deceitful and flattering words. For example, in his assembly he avoids being questioned by Aśvajit and falsely praises himself.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a02_2']	復以何緣二定以上都無表業？	復以何緣二定以上都無表業？	036	For what reason is there no action in the two stages of trance and above?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a03_5']	於欲界中無有有覆無記表業，以無發業等起心故。	於欲界中無有有覆無記表業，以無發業等起心故。	036	In the realm of desire there is no indication of the morally defiled and indeterminate, because there is no mind of instigation that generates action.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a04_4']	有尋伺心能發表業，二定以上都無此心。	有尋伺心能發表業，二定以上都無此心。	036	A mind with applied thought and sustained thought can generate indication, but above the second trance state this mind is totally absent.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a05_12']	豈不前言生上三地，如亦得起下三識身，發表業心如何不起？	豈不前言生上三地，如亦得起下三識身，發表業心如何不起？	036	We have already said that when one is born in the three upper stages, he can also generate the three consciousnesses of the lower stages and generate the indication of these actions. Why can’t he generate the mind that generates the indication of action?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a06_11', 'ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a06_16']	豈不已說依上地身，雖得現前而非彼繫。🔽有作是說：	豈不已說依上地身，雖得現前而非彼繫。 有作是說：	036	Haven’t we already said that even though one can manifest these consciousnesses of the lower stages by means of a body in the upper stages, they are not bound to the upper stages?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a07_13']	依餘地身，非起餘地心，能發身語表。	依餘地身，非起餘地心，能發身語表。	036	There is an opinion that holds that one cannot generate the mind of a lower stage by means of a body in the other stages and generate the indication of body and speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a09_1']	若爾，經說世尊一時升淨居天，彼諸天眾禮拜讚歎供養世尊。	若爾，經說世尊一時升淨居天，彼諸天眾禮拜讚歎供養世尊。	036	If this is so, then a scripture says that the World Honored One once ascended to the heaven of the Pure Abodes, and the hosts of gods there bowed in reverence, praised, and made offerings to the World Honored One.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a09_10']	此經應成有語無義。	此經應成有語無義。	036	This scripture would be one with words but no meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a10_8']	又聞經說，淨居天等來詣佛所讚禮問難。	又聞經說，淨居天等來詣佛所讚禮問難。	036	Also, we hear it said in the scriptures that the gods of the Pure Abodes came to where the Buddha was, praised him, bowed, and asked questions.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a11_8']	故生餘地，起餘地心發身語表，於理無失。	故生餘地，起餘地心發身語表，於理無失。	036	Therefore there is no error in principle in generating the mind of another stage by means of a body in another stage and generating the indication of body and speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a11_20']	然如識身等，非彼地所繫。	然如識身等，非彼地所繫。	036	However, the body consciousness, etc., are not bound to that realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a12_17']	又發表心唯修所斷，見所斷惑內門轉故。	又發表心唯修所斷，見所斷惑內門轉故。	036	Moreover, the mind that expresses is only eliminated by cultivation, because the delusions eliminated by views revolve internally.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a14_17']	以欲界中決定無有有覆無記修所斷惑，是故表業上三地都無，欲界中無有覆無記表。	以欲界中決定無有有覆無記修所斷惑，是故表業上三地都無，欲界中無有覆無記表。	036	Because in the desire realm there are definitely no deluded and indeterminate delusions eliminated by cultivation, therefore, in the upper three realms there is no expression, and in the desire realm there is no deluded and indeterminate expression.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a15_14']	為但由等起，令諸法成善不善性等？	為但由等起，令諸法成善不善性等？	036	Is it only by means of origination that dharmas are made to have good, bad natures, etc.?
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a15_17']	不爾。	不爾。	036	No, it is not so.

['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a17_17']	何法何性由何因成？	何法何性由何因成？	036	What dharmas, of what natures, are established by what causes?

['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a23_1']	勝義善者，謂真解脫，以安隱義說名為善。	勝義善者，謂真解脫，以安隱義說名為善。	036	That which is good by ultimate truth is true liberation, because it is called good by the meaning of peace and security.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a24_17']	謂涅槃中眾苦永寂、最極安隱，猶如無病，此由勝義安立善名，是故涅槃名勝義善。	謂涅槃中眾苦永寂、最極安隱，猶如無病，此由勝義安立善名，是故涅槃名勝義善。	036	That is, in nirvana the many sufferings are eternally extinguished and it is the ultimate peace and security, just as when one is free from illness. This is established as the name good by ultimate truth, and for that reason nirvana is called good by ultimate truth.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a27_13']	或真解脫是勝是義得勝義名，勝謂最尊無與等者，義謂別有真實體性，此顯涅槃無等實有故名勝義，如是勝義安隱名善。	或真解脫是勝是義得勝義名，勝謂最尊無與等者，義謂別有真實體性，此顯涅槃無等實有故名勝義，如是勝義安隱名善。	036	Or, true liberation is supreme and is the truth, and it is given the name ultimate truth. Supreme means most honored and without equal. Truth means that it has a separate, real substance. This shows that nirvana is without equal and really exists and is therefore called ultimate truth. Such ultimate truth is called good because it is peace and security.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546a29_2']	如是涅槃是善常故，於一切法其體最尊，是故獨摽為勝義善。	如是涅槃是善常故，於一切法其體最尊，是故獨摽為勝義善。	036	Thus nirvana is good and eternal and for that reason its substance is the most honored of all dharmas. Therefore it is called good by ultimate truth.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546b02_9']	自性善者，謂慚愧根，以有為中唯慚與愧及無貪等三種善根，不待相應及餘等起體性是善，猶如良藥。	自性善者，謂慚愧根，以有為中唯慚與愧及無貪等三種善根，不待相應及餘等起體性是善，猶如良藥。	036	That which is good by nature is the roots of virtue of conscience and shame, because in the realm of the conditioned only these two roots of virtue, and the three roots of good consisting of nongreed, etc., are good by nature, whether or not they are associated with other dharmas or are born together with them, just as good medicine is good by nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546b04_16']	相應善者，謂彼相應，以心心所要與慚愧善根相應方成善性，若不與彼慚等相應善性不成，如雜藥水。	相應善者，謂彼相應，以心心所要與慚愧善根相應方成善性，若不與彼慚等相應善性不成，如雜藥水。	036	That which is good by association is the associated dharmas, because mind and mental activities must be associated with conscience, etc., and the roots of goodness in order to constitute good natures. If they are not associated with conscience, etc., they do not constitute good natures, just as water mixed with medicine is not sweet.
['ZH_T29_1562_036:0546b07_4']	等起善者，謂身語業、生等及得、二無心定，以是自性及相應善所等起故立等起名，如良藥汁所引生乳。	等起善者，謂身語業、生等及得、二無心定，以是自性及相應善所等起故立等起名，如良藥汁所引生乳。	036	That which is good by originating from that is the same as that which is good by association. That is, good actions of body and speech, the four characteristics of form, the attainment of non-discrimination, and the attainment of cessation, are called good by originating from that, because they originate from the good natures of intrinsic and associated good.

The previous text has already explained the accomplishment of past and future. This sentence correctly clarifies the accomplishment of the present. Therefore, we know that the explanation of abiding manifests arising, not accomplishment, because it is not only accomplished and realized in the present. Because the unmanifest action of the fixed and path [consciousnesses] follows the mind, and because when the distracted mind is manifest, it definitely does not have that [unmanifest action].
