The vast and extensive Dharma wheel is profound and abstruse, without any other means to rely on, thus it is called sudden.

The teachings are divided into three.🔽As for the sequence, based on the definitive and true teachings of the One Vehicle, the differences in the methods of antidotes and practices are summarized into three to clarify the sequence:
['ZH_T35_1732_01a:0015c15_9']	一者據方便修相對治緣起自類因行以明三教，漸即在初、頓中、圓後，三義從漸說也，初漸以生信、次頓以成行、次圓以成體用耳。	一者據方便修相對治緣起自類因行以明三教，漸即在初、頓中、圓後，三義從漸說也，初漸以生信、次頓以成行、次圓以成體用耳。	01a	First, based on the antidotes cultivated through expedient means and the self-nature causes and conditions of the various teachings, the three teachings are clarified. The gradual is at the beginning, the sudden is in the middle, and the perfect is at the end. The three meanings follow the gradual explanation. The initial gradual teaching is to give rise to faith, the subsequent sudden teaching is to perfect the practices, and the subsequent perfect teaching is to perfect the essence and function.
['ZH_T35_1732_01a:0015c17_17']	若約實際緣起自體因行以明時，頓初、漸次、圓後，初示頓以令修、次示漸彰為物、後示圓果德備故也。	若約實際緣起自體因行以明時，頓初、漸次、圓後，初示頓以令修、次示漸彰為物、後示圓果德備故也。	01a	If it is clarified based on the self-nature causes and conditions of the actual reality, the sudden is at the beginning, the gradual is next, and the perfect is at the end. Initially, the sudden is shown so that it may be cultivated. Next, the gradual is shown to benefit beings. Finally, the perfect fruition virtues are shown to be complete.
['ZH_T35_1732_01a:0015c19_17']	若約窮實法界不增不減無障礙緣起自體甚深祕密果道時，即初圓、次頓、後漸也。	若約窮實法界不增不減無障礙緣起自體甚深祕密果道時，即初圓、次頓、後漸也。	01a	If it is in terms of the ultimate Dharma realm, which is neither increasing nor decreasing, unobstructed dependent origination, the profound and secret fruition path, then the first is perfect, the next is sudden, and the last is gradual.
['ZH_T35_1732_01a:0015c23_15']	所以爾者，正以沖宗不遺於玄想、圓道不揀於始門，是以事雖近而至遠、相雖著而至密，淺至極深方窮，故初示圓令見聞、次彰頓令隨喜、後辨漸階位顯德，起信行也。	所以爾者，正以沖宗不遺於玄想、圓道不揀於始門，是以事雖近而至遠、相雖著而至密，淺至極深方窮，故初示圓令見聞、次彰頓令隨喜、後辨漸階位顯德，起信行也。	01a	The reason for this is precisely because the profound teaching does not neglect the profound contemplation, and the perfect path does not discriminate the initial stage. Therefore, although the matter is close, it is extremely distant; although the characteristics are obvious, they are extremely subtle. The shallow reaches the utmost depth, and is therefore first shown to be perfect, so that one may see and hear it; next, the sudden is revealed, so that one may rejoice in it; finally, the gradual stages are distinguished, so that the virtues are manifested and the practice of faith is aroused.
['ZH_T35_1732_01a:0015c24_6']	此即約圓以明三耳。	此即約圓以明三耳。	01a	This is precisely the explanation of the three in terms of perfection.
