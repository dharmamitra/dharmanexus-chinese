This is the proof.
['ZH_T34_1721_012:0631a21_9']	又時眾應聞說普賢事得道，故有此品來也。	又時眾應聞說普賢事得道，故有此品來也。	012	Moreover, the assembly at that time should hear the teaching of Samantabhadra's affairs and attain the Way, so this chapter exists.
['ZH_T34_1721_012:0631a22_10']	又行一乘者即是行普賢行，故普賢來勸發也。	又行一乘者即是行普賢行，故普賢來勸發也。	012	Furthermore, those who practice the One Vehicle are practicing the conduct of Samantabhadra, so Samantabhadra comes to exhort them.
['ZH_T34_1721_012:0631a25_9']	又誦持此經者既是行普賢行，行與普賢相應，則感普賢必來教其懺悔，六根清淨見十方佛及滅五逆十惡等罪，如《普賢觀》說。	又誦持此經者既是行普賢行，行與普賢相應，則感普賢必來教其懺悔，六根清淨見十方佛及滅五逆十惡等罪，如《普賢觀》說。	012	Moreover, those who recite and uphold this sutra are already practicing the conduct of Samantabhadra, and their practice accords with Samantabhadra, so they will be inspired by Samantabhadra to come and teach them to repent, purify the six sense faculties, see the Buddhas of the ten directions, and eliminate the offenses of the five rebellious acts and the ten evil deeds, as explained in the Samantabhadra Contemplation Sutra.
['ZH_T34_1721_012:0631a26_5']	又《華嚴經》七處八會，普賢、文殊善其始；	又《華嚴經》七處八會，普賢、文殊善其始；	012	Furthermore, the Huayan Sutra's seven locations and eight assemblies, Samantabhadra and Mañjuśrī are good at the beginning;

The reason these two people are in that sutra from beginning to end is that the worldly tradition says, ultimately practicing Samantabhadra's conduct, fulfilling Mañjuśrī's vow.🔽Therefore, Samantabhadra manifests the perfection of his conduct, and Mañjuśrī clarifies the fulfillment of his vow. Thus, among all the bodhisattvas, he ultimately and completely manifests that the Huayan is a perfect Dharma gate.
['ZH_T34_1721_012:0631b02_20']	今說《法華》，亦明文殊開其始、普賢通其終，亦顯《法華》是究竟法。	今說《法華》，亦明文殊開其始、普賢通其終，亦顯《法華》是究竟法。	012	Now, expounding the Lotus Sutra, it also clarifies that Mañjuśrī opens its beginning and Samantabhadra connects its end, also manifesting that the Lotus Sutra is the ultimate Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1721_012:0631b08_6']	所以二經皆明兩大士者，欲顯《華嚴》即是《法華》，為直往菩薩說令入佛慧故名《華嚴》，為迴小入大菩薩說令入佛慧故名《法華》，約人有利鈍不同、就時初後為異，故兩教名字別耳，至論平等大慧清淨一道更無有異，是故兩經皆明二菩薩也。	所以二經皆明兩大士者，欲顯《華嚴》即是《法華》，為直往菩薩說令入佛慧故名《華嚴》，為迴小入大菩薩說令入佛慧故名《法華》，約人有利鈍不同、就時初後為異，故兩教名字別耳，至論平等大慧清淨一道更無有異，是故兩經皆明二菩薩也。	012	Therefore, both sutras clarify the two great beings, wanting to show that the Flower Ornament Sutra is precisely the Lotus Sutra. For the bodhisattvas who go straight, it is taught to make them enter the Buddha's wisdom, so it is called the Flower Ornament Sutra. For the bodhisattvas who turn from the small to the great, it is taught to make them enter the Buddha's wisdom, so it is called the Lotus Sutra. In terms of people, there is a difference in sharpness and dullness, and in terms of time, there is a difference in beginning and end, so the two teachings have different names. As for the ultimate equal great wisdom and pure single path, there is no difference. Therefore, both sutras clarify the two bodhisattvas.
