The essence of cognition reflects phenomena and forms the sense organ. The root of the organ is called the four great elements of purity. It is named the mind, like seeing in a dark room.

Apart from movement and apart from stillness, there is originally no substance for hearing. Without passage and without obstruction, the nature of smell is not born. Not changing and not bland, taste has no origin. Not apart and not united, the awareness of touch is originally non-existent. Without ceasing and without arising, where can cognition be found?
