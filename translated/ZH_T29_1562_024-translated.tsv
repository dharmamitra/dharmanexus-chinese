['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a15_1']	如無色界歿，中無連續，欲色界色生。	如無色界歿，中無連續，欲色界色生。	Just as when one dies in the formless realm, there is no continuity in the intermediate state, and form arises in the desire and form realms,
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a16_8']	如是亦應此死有滅，中無連續，彼生有起，所引穀喻於證無能。	如是亦應此死有滅，中無連續，彼生有起，所引穀喻於證無能。	in the same way, when this death existence ceases, there is no continuity in the intermediate state, and that birth existence arises. The cited analogy of the seed is unable to prove this.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a19_10']	又此喻中有非愛過，謂同法喻例法應同，然穀等種中唯生穀芽等，如是人歿應但生人，牛等歿時唯生牛等，故喻於此有非愛過。	又此喻中有非愛過，謂同法喻例法應同，然穀等種中唯生穀芽等，如是人歿應但生人，牛等歿時唯生牛等，故喻於此有非愛過。	Moreover, there is a fault of non-love in this analogy. In a similar analogy, the principle should be the same. However, only grains and so forth arise from the seeds of grains and so forth. In the same way, when a human dies, they should only give rise to humans. When cows and so forth die, they only give rise to cows and so forth. Therefore, the analogy has a fault of non-love in this case.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a21_16']	又種滅處即有芽生，應眼根中識等滅已，即於是處識等還生，則唯一根恒生識等，如是耳等便為無用。	又種滅處即有芽生，應眼根中識等滅已，即於是處識等還生，則唯一根恒生識等，如是耳等便為無用。	Moreover, the sprout arises in the place where the seed ceases. It should be that in the eye faculty, after the cessation of consciousness and so forth, consciousness and so forth arise again in that very place. Then only one faculty would always give rise to consciousness and so forth. In this way, the ear and so forth would be useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a23_6']	又一身中識等滅已，即復於此識等還生，是則恒存應無死義。	又一身中識等滅已，即復於此識等還生，是則恒存應無死義。	Also, in one body, when consciousness and so on cease, they arise again in that body. In that case, they would be eternal and there would be no death.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a26_14']	如是死有於此處滅，即於此處中有復生，後後念生即前前處，乃至中有滅，即此生有生，是則應無往餘生義，中有勝用於此頓亡，巧立如斯害自宗喻。	如是死有於此處滅，即於此處中有復生，後後念生即前前處，乃至中有滅，即此生有生，是則應無往餘生義，中有勝用於此頓亡，巧立如斯害自宗喻。	In the same way, when death existence ceases in a certain place, intermediate existence is born in that place. The subsequent moments of birth existence are born in the same place as the previous moments of intermediate existence. When intermediate existence ceases, birth existence is born. In that case, there would be no going to another birth. The superior function of intermediate existence would suddenly cease in that place. This clever establishment harms the analogy of your own school.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a27_6', 'ZH_T29_1562_024:0474a28_5']	此皆非理，所以者何？🔽從無色歿生有色者，色法生時有連續故。	此皆非理，所以者何？ 從無色歿生有色者，色法生時有連續故。	All of this is unreasonable. Why is it so?🔽Those who die in the formless realm and are born in the form realm, when form arises, there is continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b01_6']	謂無色歿生欲色時，即由是處大種和合，從順後受業有異熟色生，故彼色生非無連續。	謂無色歿生欲色時，即由是處大種和合，從順後受業有異熟色生，故彼色生非無連續。	When dying in the formless realm and being born in the desire or form realms, form arises due to the combination of the four great elements in that place. It arises from the ripening of karma that accords with subsequent experience. Therefore, the arising of that form is not without continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b04_3']	或總相續無間斷故，謂無色界異熟終時，四無色蘊無間無斷為緣引發，欲色界中與色俱生諸蘊令起，故彼色起非無連續。	或總相續無間斷故，謂無色界異熟終時，四無色蘊無間無斷為緣引發，欲色界中與色俱生諸蘊令起，故彼色起非無連續。	Or, the continuity of the aggregates is uninterrupted, because when the retribution of the formless realm ends, the four formless aggregates are uninterrupted and without discontinuity as conditions that attract and produce the aggregates born with form in the realms of desire and form. Therefore the arising of form is not without continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b06_3']	欲色界歿欲色界生，死生中間處所懸隔，若無少物於中連持，無色死生下豈得為同喻？	欲色界歿欲色界生，死生中間處所懸隔，若無少物於中連持，無色死生下豈得為同喻？	When one dies in the realm of desire or form and is born in the realm of desire or form, the place of death and the place of rebirth are far removed from each other. If there is no small amount of form to connect the two places, how can the formless realms be a similar example?
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b08_1']	又於此中無非愛過，如一稻種，為芽󰉓飯灰散五因，如是有情一趣相續，為五因故。	又於此中無非愛過，如一稻種，為芽󰉓飯灰散五因，如是有情一趣相續，為五因故。	Also, there is no fault of non-affection in this case, just as a single grain of rice is the five causes of a sprout, rice, porridge, cooked rice, and ashes. In the same way, sentient beings are the five causes of a single realm of rebirth.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b08_19']	謂一稻種能為五因，若遇順緣便生自果。	謂一稻種能為五因，若遇順緣便生自果。	That is, a single grain of rice can be the five causes. If it encounters favorable conditions, it will produce its own effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b10_17']	如是一趣有情相續，具為五因，若遇如是順緣和合便生自果，故無人等滅唯生自類過。	如是一趣有情相續，具為五因，若遇如是順緣和合便生自果，故無人等滅唯生自類過。	In the same way, the continuity of sentient beings in a single realm of rebirth is fully the five causes. If it encounters such a combination of favorable conditions, it will produce its own effect. Therefore there is no fault of the extinction of humans and so on and the production of only their own kind.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b12_8']	又無如種芽同處生滅失，以種相續生芽等時，雖無間斷非無處異。	又無如種芽同處生滅失，以種相續生芽等時，雖無間斷非無處異。	Also, there is no error that seed and sprout are born and perish in the same place, because when the continuity of the seed produces the sprout, etc., although there is no interruption, there is not no difference in place.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b13_7']	准斯理趣，內法亦然，故無果因唯同處失。	准斯理趣，內法亦然，故無果因唯同處失。	In accordance with this principle, internal dharmas are also like this. Therefore there is no error that cause and effect are only in the same place.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b16_4']	謂諸種聚於滅壞時，由水等緣和合攝助，能為麁大芽聚生因，於種滅時芽異處起，芽雖增長轉至遠方，而於中間隣次無斷。	謂諸種聚於滅壞時，由水等緣和合攝助，能為麁大芽聚生因，於種滅時芽異處起，芽雖增長轉至遠方，而於中間隣次無斷。	That is, when a mass of seeds is destroyed, through the combination of water, etc., it can be a cause for the production of a large mass of sprouts, etc. When the seeds are destroyed, the sprouts arise in another place. Although the sprouts grow and move to a distant place, there is no interruption in the continuity in the middle.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b18_2']	由此外法從種生芽處，非隔即隣次道理，如是內法隨所依身心相續轉，亦無有失。	由此外法從種生芽處，非隔即隣次道理，如是內法隨所依身心相續轉，亦無有失。	Because in external dharmas, from seed to sprout, the place is not separated but continuous. In the same way, internal dharmas, following the body and mind that are their supports, evolve in a continuity, and there is no error.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b23_14']	謂於死時，大種等聚由業風等緣所攝持，能與當生隣死處起大種等聚為能生因，獨業不能令彼色聚中無連續遠處欻生，隣死所生即是中有，從茲展轉趣餘方生，於其中間非即非越能至生有，如從種等芽等漸生能至於果，故舉穀喻非害自宗。	謂於死時，大種等聚由業風等緣所攝持，能與當生隣死處起大種等聚為能生因，獨業不能令彼色聚中無連續遠處欻生，隣死所生即是中有，從茲展轉趣餘方生，於其中間非即非越能至生有，如從種等芽等漸生能至於果，故舉穀喻非害自宗。	That is, at the time of death, the aggregate of the four great elements and so on is held by the conditions of karmic winds and so on, and is able to provide the cause for the arising of the aggregate of the four great elements and so on that will be born next, which occurs in the place of death. Karmic action alone cannot cause the aggregate of form to suddenly arise in a distant place without continuity. What is born next to death is the intermediate state of existence. From this, it gradually moves to the next place of birth. In the middle, it is neither the same as nor different from the existence at death, and is able to reach the existence at birth. It is like the gradual arising of the sprout and so on from the seed and so on, which is able to reach the fruit. Therefore, citing the analogy of grain does not harm our own position.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b26_11']	或復何勞強撥中有，世曾未見有諸色聚中無連續於異處生，唯見影光火焰等事中間連續至餘方生，故非頓亡中有勝用。	或復何勞強撥中有，世曾未見有諸色聚中無連續於異處生，唯見影光火焰等事中間連續至餘方生，故非頓亡中有勝用。	Or, moreover, why bother to strongly deny the intermediate state of existence? The world has never seen any aggregate of form that lacks continuity and arises in a different place. It is only seen that shadows, light, flames, and so on have continuity in the middle and reach the place of birth in another direction. Therefore, the excellent function of the intermediate state of existence is not suddenly lost.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b27_15']	然眼識等緣和合力，不越依身別別處起，無方所故。	然眼識等緣和合力，不越依身別別處起，無方所故。	However, the power of the combination of conditions, such as the eye consciousness and so on, does not go beyond the body and arises in separate places. Because it has no direction or location.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b28_18']	非住一根於一身中識常生滅，恒無死難由斯已解。	非住一根於一身中識常生滅，恒無死難由斯已解。	It is not that a single faculty always arises and ceases in a single body, and there is no danger of eternal non-death due to this.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474b29_18']	或復死者同分蘊滅、異分蘊生，故無斯過。	或復死者同分蘊滅、異分蘊生，故無斯過。	Or, death is the cessation of the aggregates of the same continuity and the arising of the aggregates of a different continuity, so this fault does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c03_5']	且化生者，先世所作業果色根并所依處，此處頓滅，即於此處容有其餘業果頓起，可疑死位與前無別。	且化生者，先世所作業果色根并所依處，此處頓滅，即於此處容有其餘業果頓起，可疑死位與前無別。	First, for those born supernaturally, the form faculties and their supporting bases that are the results of karma from previous lives suddenly cease, and in that very place, the results of other karma may suddenly arise. It is doubtful that the state of death is no different from before.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c05_13']	餘三生者，先世所作業果色根相續雖滅，而見依處相似隨轉，非後色根無所依處，別業果故，非即依前。	餘三生者，先世所作業果色根相續雖滅，而見依處相似隨轉，非後色根無所依處，別業果故，非即依前。	For those born from wombs, etc., the continuity of the form faculties and their supporting bases that are the results of karma from previous lives ceases, but it is seen that the similar supporting bases continue to function. It is not that the subsequent form faculties have no supporting bases, because they are the results of separate karma, and they are not based on the previous [body].
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c08_10']	由此證知，餘業所感根及依處，隣次前身根滅所依，異處而起有對礙法，自所住方必能障餘令不起故，於此無有恒不死疑。	由此證知，餘業所感根及依處，隣次前身根滅所依，異處而起有對礙法，自所住方必能障餘令不起故，於此無有恒不死疑。	This proves that the faculties and supporting bases produced by other karma arise in a different place from the faculties of the previous body, which have ceased as their supporting bases. This is because the obstructed dharmas, in the place where they exist, are certainly able to obstruct others and prevent them from arising. Therefore, there is no doubt that there is eternal non-death in this case.

['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c10_16']	猶如尺蠖前安前足後足後移，如是死生方所雖隔，先取後捨得至餘方，是故於斯中有無用。	猶如尺蠖前安前足後足後移，如是死生方所雖隔，先取後捨得至餘方，是故於斯中有無用。	It is like a millipede that first places its front foot and then moves its rear foot. In this way, although death and birth are separated in different places, it first takes the later and then abandons the earlier, and thus it can reach another place. Therefore, there is no need for an intermediate existence in this case.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c11_6']	毘婆沙者貶此釋言：	毘婆沙者貶此釋言：	The Vaibhāṣikas disparage this interpretation, saying:
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c12_15']	此釋極同下俚言義，如是便有非二有情二趣二心俱行過故。	此釋極同下俚言義，如是便有非二有情二趣二心俱行過故。	This interpretation is extremely similar to the meaning of vulgar speech. In this way, there would be the fault of two sentient beings, two destinies, and two minds operating together.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c14_5']	又尺蠖喻，其理不成，以彼蟲身中無間絕，安前移後處隔可然；	又尺蠖喻，其理不成，以彼蟲身中無間絕，安前移後處隔可然；	Moreover, the analogy of the millipede is not established, because there is no interruption in the body of that insect. It is reasonable that it places its front foot and then moves its rear foot in a continuous manner;
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c15_4']	死生有身中間隔絕，如何可得取生有身？	死生有身中間隔絕，如何可得取生有身？	But there is an interruption between death and birth. How can it take the body of birth?
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c15_14']	既未取生，如何捨死？	既未取生，如何捨死？	If it has not yet taken birth, how can it abandon death?
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c16_14']	非心心所處無斷可成，離所依身處續義無故。	非心心所處無斷可成，離所依身處續義無故。	It is not possible for mind and mental factors to be interrupted in a place without an interval, because there is no meaning of continuity in a place separated from the supporting body.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c17_13']	若謂有色為無斷依，則為中有義已成立。	若謂有色為無斷依，則為中有義已成立。	If it is said that form is the support for the uninterrupted [existence], then the meaning of intermediate existence is already established.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c18_12']	若謂死生雖隔而到，則尺蠖喻義不相應。	若謂死生雖隔而到，則尺蠖喻義不相應。	If it is said that although death and birth are separated, it reaches [the next existence], then the analogy of the millipede is not appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c18_17']	有餘復言：	有餘復言：	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c19_11']	死生二有雖隔而至，如意勢通。	死生二有雖隔而至，如意勢通。	Although death and birth exist separately, they are connected like the power of thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c20_1']	此亦不然，非所許故。	此亦不然，非所許故。	This is also unreasonable, because it is not accepted.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c21_1']	異此餘類此歿彼生，中間隔絕，應成通慧。	異此餘類此歿彼生，中間隔絕，應成通慧。	Other than this, if one dies here and is born there, the interval is cut off, and one should attain the supernormal power of spiritual penetrations.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c21_11']	若爾，此應是行差別。	若爾，此應是行差別。	If this is so, then this should be a kind of action.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c22_8']	實爾，細故難可了知，謂一剎那不應為難。	實爾，細故難可了知，謂一剎那不應為難。	This is true, but it is subtle and difficult to understand. It should not be difficult to understand in a single moment.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c23_16']	故前穀喻無過理成，以要相連處無間斷生有起故，定有中有。	故前穀喻無過理成，以要相連處無間斷生有起故，定有中有。	Therefore, the previous analogy of grain is reasonable and established without fault, because it must be connected, with no interruption, for birth to occur. Therefore, there definitely is an intermediate state.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c24_7']	又有別理，中有非無。	又有別理，中有非無。	There is another principle that the intermediate state is not nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c25_5']	現見剎那無間生者，決定方所無間生故。	現見剎那無間生者，決定方所無間生故。	It is seen that what arises without interruption definitely arises in a specific place without interruption.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c26_14']	謂世現見，從執受色無間還生執受色者，剎那處所俱無間生。	謂世現見，從執受色無間還生執受色者，剎那處所俱無間生。	It is seen in the world that what arises from appropriated form without interruption arises in a moment and in a place without interruption.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c28_3']	若生有色，許從死有剎那無間隣近而生，處所亦應無間隣近。	若生有色，許從死有剎那無間隣近而生，處所亦應無間隣近。	If one who is born in the form realm is allowed to arise without interruption in a moment from the intermediate state of death, the place should also be without interruption.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0474c28_15']	然無如是理，故中有義成。	然無如是理，故中有義成。	But this is not the case, and therefore the existence of an intermediate state is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a02_11']	若謂如從無色界歿生有色界，色初起時，昔色與今方所無間、剎那有間而得續生，亦應下界死生有色剎那無間處有間生。	若謂如從無色界歿生有色界，色初起時，昔色與今方所無間、剎那有間而得續生，亦應下界死生有色剎那無間處有間生。	If you say that when form first appears in one who dies in the formless realm and is reborn in the realm of form, the form of the present life is born in continuity with the form of the previous life, with no interval of space between them, but with an interval of time between them, then when one dies in the lower realms and is reborn in the realm of form, the form of the present life should be born in continuity with the form of the previous life, with no interval of time between them, but with an interval of space between them.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a03_2']	此亦不然，不了宗故。	此亦不然，不了宗故。	This is not so, because you do not understand the meaning of our argument.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a06_8']	謂於昔者從欲色歿生無色時，色身滅處，今從彼歿生欲色時，即前色身滅處，無間引今色起，非我所宗，是故此中剎那處所俱非隣近，不應為喻。	謂於昔者從欲色歿生無色時，色身滅處，今從彼歿生欲色時，即前色身滅處，無間引今色起，非我所宗，是故此中剎那處所俱非隣近，不應為喻。	When one dies in the realm of desire or form and is reborn in the formless realm, the place where the body of form ceases to exist is the place where the body of form is born when one dies in the formless realm and is reborn in the realm of desire or form. The body of form that is born is not born in continuity with the body of form that has ceased to exist. This is not our doctrine. Therefore in this case there is no continuity of place or time, and this is not a proper analogy.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a07_7']	又若剎那隣近生者，處所定爾，非由種故。	又若剎那隣近生者，處所定爾，非由種故。	Moreover, if birth is continuous in time, it must also be continuous in place, and not due to seeds.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a09_5']	謂諸剎那無間生者，處所必定亦無間生，非此相違有斯決定，故彼所例理不相應。	謂諸剎那無間生者，處所必定亦無間生，非此相違有斯決定，故彼所例理不相應。	That is, if there is continuity of time between moments of birth, there must also be continuity of place between them. There is no such certainty in the case of discontinuity. Therefore the analogy you have given is not appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a10_6']	又餘緣合方成因性，現所見故，中有義成。	又餘緣合方成因性，現所見故，中有義成。	Also, the nature of a cause is established only when other conditions are present, because this is what is seen in the present.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a11_6']	謂諸種子餘助緣合，能作芽因，世所現見。	謂諸種子餘助緣合，能作芽因，世所現見。	That is, it is seen in the present that seeds can be causes of sprouts only when other assisting conditions are present.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a12_14']	如是識種生生有色，必藉生處外色為緣，故識定與生處色合。	如是識種生生有色，必藉生處外色為緣，故識定與生處色合。	In the same way, the seeds of consciousness must rely on the external form of the place of rebirth as a condition in order to produce the form of the intermediate state and the form of rebirth. Therefore consciousness must be associated with the form of the place of rebirth.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a14_3']	不應一識與死有身及生處所處間斷色有俱合義，故有中有。	不應一識與死有身及生處所處間斷色有俱合義，故有中有。	It is not possible for a single consciousness to be associated with the form of the body of the prior existence, the form of the place of rebirth, and the form of the intermediate state. Therefore there is an intermediate existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_024:0475a15_2']	若謂非色無所住處故無過者，理亦不然。	若謂非色無所住處故無過者，理亦不然。	If you claim that there is no error because that which is not form has no place in which to exist, this is also unreasonable.
