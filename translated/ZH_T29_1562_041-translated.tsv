The sūtra says that there are four kinds of karma, namely, there is karma with black black ripening, or there is karma with white white ripening, or there is karma with black and white black and white ripening, or there is karma that is neither black nor white.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573a19_17']	無異熟業能盡諸業，經雖略示而不廣釋，今應釋彼，其相云何？	無異熟業能盡諸業，經雖略示而不廣釋，今應釋彼，其相云何？	Karma that can exhaust all karma without ripening, although the sūtra briefly shows it, it does not explain it in detail. Now it should be explained, what are its characteristics?

['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573b01_19']	無色界中有可意白，無明了白可施設故，不立白名。	無色界中有可意白，無明了白可施設故，不立白名。	The formless realm has desirable white but does not have clear white that can be designated, and therefore it is not called white.

['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573b10_10']	諸異熟因由業所顯，故非業者亦立業名，證知彼經非了義。	諸異熟因由業所顯，故非業者亦立業名，證知彼經非了義。	Because retribution is manifested by action, that which is not action is also called action. This proves that this scripture is not definitive.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573b11_18']	說欲界善業名為黑白，惡所雜故，異熟亦黑白，非愛果雜故。	說欲界善業名為黑白，惡所雜故，異熟亦黑白，非愛果雜故。	It is said that good action in the realm of desire is called black and white, because it is mixed with evil. Its retribution is also black and white, because it is mixed with undesirable results.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573b12_12']	此黑白名依相續立，非據自性。	此黑白名依相續立，非據自性。	The names black and white are established on the basis of the continuity of action, not on the basis of its own nature.

['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573b18_4']	欲界善劣無有功能𣣋伏不善，故彼樂果亦無功能雜苦異熟，故惡業果得純黑名。	欲界善劣無有功能𣣋伏不善，故彼樂果亦無功能雜苦異熟，故惡業果得純黑名。	Good in the realm of desire is weak and has no power to subdue evil, and therefore the result of pleasure has no power to mix with the retribution of suffering. Therefore the result of evil karma is called pure black.

For this reason, the two names black and white are established, but the substance of one karma is neither good nor evil.

This is called having a black intention but a white performance.

This is called having a black means but a white end.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573b26_15']	若爾，不善應名白黑，以如善業亦有如前意樂加行白黑雜起。	若爾，不善應名白黑，以如善業亦有如前意樂加行白黑雜起。	If this is so, then non-good should be called white and black, because, like good actions, it also arises from a mixture of white and black means and ends.

['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573b29_4']	諸無漏業能永斷盡前三業者名第四業，此無漏業非染污故，得非黑名，於理無失。	諸無漏業能永斷盡前三業者名第四業，此無漏業非染污故，得非黑名，於理無失。	The fourth kind of action is that which is able to eternally eliminate the first three kinds of action. This fourth kind of action is called pure, because it is not defiled.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573c01_4']	不墮界故、斷異熟故，名無異熟，亦無有失。	不墮界故、斷異熟故，名無異熟，亦無有失。	It is not erroneous to say that it is not black, because it does not fall into the three realms of existence, and it is not erroneous to say that it has no retribution, because it eliminates retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573c01_16']	既是勝義白，何故名非白？	既是勝義白，何故名非白？	Since it is the highest truth of purity, why is it called not white?

['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573c06_11']	如何此中白能治白？	如何此中白能治白？	How can purity here be the antidote to purity?

['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573c11_1']	故彼經中依如是義，於無學法說純白聲。	故彼經中依如是義，於無學法說純白聲。	Therefore, in that sūtra, based on this meaning, the purely white sound is spoken of with regard to the dharmas of the stage of post-learner.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573c12_9']	今此經中以無漏業非順愛故，又不能感白異熟故，說名非白。	今此經中以無漏業非順愛故，又不能感白異熟故，說名非白。	In this sūtra, because uncontaminated karma is not in accordance with what is desirable, and also because it cannot attract white retribution, it is called non-white.

['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573c22_6']	離欲界染第九無間聖道俱行，一無漏思雙令黑白及純黑盡，此時總斷欲界善故，亦斷第九不善業故。	離欲界染第九無間聖道俱行，一無漏思雙令黑白及純黑盡，此時總斷欲界善故，亦斷第九不善業故。	In the ninth uninterrupted path of the noble path accompanied by the separation from the defilements of the desire realm, one pure thought causes both black and white and pure black to be exhausted. At this time, because the wholesome karma of the desire realm is completely eliminated, the ninth unwholesome karma is also eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_041:0573c23_7']	離四靜慮一一地染，第九無間道俱行無漏思。	離四靜慮一一地染，第九無間道俱行無漏思。	In the separation from the defilements of each of the four meditations, the ninth uninterrupted path is accompanied by pure thoughts.
