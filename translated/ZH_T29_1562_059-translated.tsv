If one wishes to understand them all, one should seek them in the treatises on contemplation practices compiled by the sages.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668b04_3']	以要言之，初修行者應於解脫具深意樂，觀涅槃德背生死過，先應方便親近善友，善友能為眾行本故。	以要言之，初修行者應於解脫具深意樂，觀涅槃德背生死過，先應方便親近善友，善友能為眾行本故。	To put it briefly, a beginning practitioner should have a deep aspiration for liberation and contemplate the virtues of nirvāṇa and the faults of samsara. First, one should skillfully draw near to good friends, because good friends are the foundation of all practices.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668b04_12']	具聞等力得善友名。	具聞等力得善友名。	One is called a good friend by possessing the power of learning and so forth.

The medicines given should not be wasted.

['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668b29_12']	功德過失隨年位殊，故應觀察。	功德過失隨年位殊，故應觀察。	Because merit and demerit differ according to age and stage, one should observe this.

['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c06_0']	將趣見諦道，　　應住戒勤修，	將趣見諦道，　　應住戒勤修，	In order to enter the path of seeing the truth, one should abide in precepts and diligently practice,
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c07_13']	聞思修所成，　　謂名俱義境。	聞思修所成，　　謂名俱義境。	Realizing through hearing, thinking, and cultivation, with names, meanings, and objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c08_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c09_15']	諸有發心將趣見諦，應先安住清淨尸羅，然後勤修聞所成等，故世尊說：	諸有發心將趣見諦，應先安住清淨尸羅，然後勤修聞所成等，故世尊說：	Those who give rise to the mind and are about to enter the path of seeing the truth should first abide in pure precepts, and then diligently cultivate what is accomplished through hearing and so forth. Therefore, the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c10_8']	依住尸羅，於二法中能勤修習。	依住尸羅，於二法中能勤修習。	Relying on abiding in the precepts, one can diligently cultivate and practice in the two dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c13_13']	謂先安住清淨戒已，復數親近諸瑜伽師，隨瑜伽師教授誡勗，精勤攝受順見諦聞，聞已勤求所聞法義，令師教誡所生慧增漸勝漸明乃至純熟。	謂先安住清淨戒已，復數親近諸瑜伽師，隨瑜伽師教授誡勗，精勤攝受順見諦聞，聞已勤求所聞法義，令師教誡所生慧增漸勝漸明乃至純熟。	That is to say, having first abided in pure precepts, one should then frequently draw near to the yogis, and according to the yogis' instructions and admonitions, diligently accept and follow the hearing that accords with seeing the truth. Having heard, one diligently seeks the meaning of the Dharma that is heard, causing the wisdom that arises from the teacher's instructions and admonitions to gradually increase and become more and more pure until it is fully matured.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c15_3']	非唯於此生喜足心，復於法義自專思擇，如是如是決定慧生。	非唯於此生喜足心，復於法義自專思擇，如是如是決定慧生。	One should not be satisfied with this alone, but should also reflect on the meaning of the Dharma by oneself. In this way, the wisdom of certainty will arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c16_10']	自思為因決慧生已，能勤修習諸煩惱等自相共相二對治修。	自思為因決慧生已，能勤修習諸煩惱等自相共相二對治修。	When the wisdom of certainty arises due to self-reflection as the cause, one will be able to diligently cultivate the two types of antidotes to the afflictions and so forth, namely the specific and the general characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c18_13']	今於此中略攝義者，謂修行者住戒勤修，依聞所成慧起思所成慧，依思所成慧起修所成慧。	今於此中略攝義者，謂修行者住戒勤修，依聞所成慧起思所成慧，依思所成慧起修所成慧。	Now, in this brief summary, it means that the practitioner, abiding in the precepts and diligently cultivating, gives rise to the wisdom accomplished through hearing, which in turn gives rise to the wisdom accomplished through thinking, and based on the wisdom accomplished through thinking, one gives rise to the wisdom accomplished through cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c19_3']	此三慧相差別云何？	此三慧相差別云何？	What are the differences in the characteristics of these three wisdoms?
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c20_11']	謂如次緣名俱義境，理實三慧於成滿時，一切皆唯緣義為境。	謂如次緣名俱義境，理實三慧於成滿時，一切皆唯緣義為境。	It means that they take as their objects the names, the meanings associated with the names, and the meanings alone, respectively. In reality, when the three wisdoms are fully accomplished, all of them take only the meanings as their objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c21_18']	爾時難辯三慧相別，故今且約加行位辯說聞思修緣名俱義。	爾時難辯三慧相別，故今且約加行位辯說聞思修緣名俱義。	At that time, it is difficult to distinguish the differences in the characteristics of the three wisdoms, so now we will simply discuss the differences in the objects of hearing, thinking, and cultivation in terms of the stage of preparation.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c23_3']	非唯緣名境，有決定慧生，故聞所成慧，不但緣名境。	非唯緣名境，有決定慧生，故聞所成慧，不但緣名境。	It is not that the wisdom accomplished through hearing only takes names as its objects, for there is certainty in wisdom that arises from taking meanings as its objects. Therefore, the wisdom accomplished through hearing does not only take names as its objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c24_14']	然隨師說名句文身故，於義差別有決定慧生，此慧名為聞所成慧。	然隨師說名句文身故，於義差別有決定慧生，此慧名為聞所成慧。	However, because one follows the teacher’s words, phrases, and sentences, a definite understanding arises with regard to the distinctions in meaning. This understanding is called understanding consisting of hearing.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c25_13']	約入方便說但緣名，聞慧成已為知別義。	約入方便說但緣名，聞慧成已為知別義。	In terms of the expedient for entering, it is said to only take names as objects. After understanding consisting of hearing is accomplished, in order to know the distinctions in meaning,
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0668c28_1']	復加精勤自審思擇，欲令思擇無謬失故，復念師教名句文身，由此後時於義差別，生決定慧名思所成。	復加精勤自審思擇，欲令思擇無謬失故，復念師教名句文身，由此後時於義差別，生決定慧名思所成。	one further applies oneself diligently to careful consideration. In order to prevent mistakes in consideration, one further recollects the teacher’s words, phrases, and sentences. Because of this, one later generates a definite understanding with regard to the distinctions in meaning. This is called understanding consisting of thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a01_7']	此加行時由思義力，引念名故說緣俱境，思慧成已等引現前不待名言證義差別，此決定慧名修所成。	此加行時由思義力，引念名故說緣俱境，思慧成已等引現前不待名言證義差別，此決定慧名修所成。	At the time of this added effort, because of the power of the meaning of thought, one recollects the names. Therefore, it is said to take both as objects. After understanding consisting of thought is accomplished, it appears in samādhi. Without depending on names and words, one realizes the distinctions in meaning. This definite understanding is called understanding consisting of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a03_14']	諸瑜伽師此中立喻，如彩畫者習彩畫時，最初從師敬受畫本，審諦瞻相臨本倣學，數毀數習乃至刮真。	諸瑜伽師此中立喻，如彩畫者習彩畫時，最初從師敬受畫本，審諦瞻相臨本倣學，數毀數習乃至刮真。	Yogācāra masters establish a metaphor in this regard. It is like a painter who, when learning to paint, first respectfully receives a painting from his teacher. He carefully observes the image and imitates it according to the painting. He does this many times, and even when he has reached perfection, he still does not stop.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a04_14']	然後背本數思數習，為令所習無謬失故。	然後背本數思數習，為令所習無謬失故。	Then, turning away from the original object, one contemplates and repeatedly practices it, in order to avoid error in what one is practicing.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a06_3']	復將比校所倣畫本，令己所造等本或增，不爾所習無增進理。	復將比校所倣畫本，令己所造等本或增，不爾所習無增進理。	Again, one compares what one is imitating with the original object, so that what one has created is equal to the original or even surpasses it. If it is not so, there is no principle of progress in what one is practicing.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a07_2']	由此後時所作轉勝，無勞觀本隨欲皆成。	由此後時所作轉勝，無勞觀本隨欲皆成。	Because of this, what one does later becomes increasingly superior, and without the trouble of observing the original object, one can accomplish it as one wishes.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a07_11']	習三慧法應知亦爾。	習三慧法應知亦爾。	One should know that the method of cultivating the three wisdoms is also like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a08_19']	毘婆沙師復別立喻，如有一類浮深駛水，曾未學者不能離岸；	毘婆沙師復別立喻，如有一類浮深駛水，曾未學者不能離岸；	The Vaibhāṣikas also establish a separate analogy, like a person floating in deep, swift water. One who has never learned cannot leave the shore;
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a10_7']	及浮所依曾學未成，能暫捨離去之不遠，恐乏沈溺復還趣岸；	及浮所依曾學未成，能暫捨離去之不遠，恐乏沈溺復還趣岸；	and one who is floating and relying on what one has learned but is not yet accomplished can temporarily let go, but not go too far away, fearing exhaustion and drowning, and return to the shore again;
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a12_14']	或執所依曾善學者，能無勞倦不顧岸依，雖經極深險難洄澓，能免淪沒自在浮渡，如是應知三慧相別。	或執所依曾善學者，能無勞倦不顧岸依，雖經極深險難洄澓，能免淪沒自在浮渡，如是應知三慧相別。	or one who has learned well and relies on what one has relied on can be without fatigue and not care about the shore, and even though one goes through extremely deep and dangerous whirlpools, one can avoid sinking and drowning and freely float across. One should know that the distinctions of the three wisdoms are like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a14_3']	經主謂此思慧不成，謂此既通緣名緣義，如次應是聞修所成。	經主謂此思慧不成，謂此既通緣名緣義，如次應是聞修所成。	The author of the Śāstra says that this thought does not constitute wisdom, because it is both that which takes names as objects and that which takes things as objects, and as such it should be both hearing and cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a16_18']	今詳三相無過別者，謂修行者依聞至教所生勝慧名聞所成，依思正理所生勝慧名思所成，依修等持所生勝慧名修所成。	今詳三相無過別者，謂修行者依聞至教所生勝慧名聞所成，依思正理所生勝慧名思所成，依修等持所生勝慧名修所成。	We now examine the three characteristics and find that there is no error in distinguishing them. That is, the superior wisdom that arises in a practitioner in dependence on the teachings of the scriptures is called that which is accomplished by hearing. The superior wisdom that arises in dependence on the correct principles of thought is called that which is accomplished by thought. The superior wisdom that arises in dependence on samādhi is called that which is accomplished by cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a18_8']	彼由未達毘婆沙意故作是言，然毘婆沙辯三相別，意不如是。	彼由未達毘婆沙意故作是言，然毘婆沙辯三相別，意不如是。	Because they have not understood the meaning of the Vibhāṣā, they say this. However, the meaning of the Vibhāṣā in distinguishing the three characteristics is not like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a19_15']	謂若有慧於加行時，由緣名力引生義解，此所引慧名聞所成；	謂若有慧於加行時，由緣名力引生義解，此所引慧名聞所成；	That is, if there is wisdom that, at the time of added effort, induces the understanding of things by the power of taking names as objects, the wisdom that is induced is called that which is accomplished by hearing.
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0669a21_4']	若加行時由思義力引念名解，由此於後生決定慧名思所成；	若加行時由思義力引念名解，由此於後生決定慧名思所成；	If, at the time of added effort, one induces the understanding of names by the power of thinking about things, and on this basis one subsequently generates the wisdom of certainty, it is called that which is accomplished by thought.

One should know that this is called the contemplation of impurity.

['ZH_T29_1562_059:0672b14_5']	謂不淨觀能近治貪故，應正以無貪為性，貪因淨相、由觀力除，故說無貪為觀所順。	謂不淨觀能近治貪故，應正以無貪為性，貪因淨相、由觀力除，故說無貪為觀所順。	That is to say, the contemplation of impurity is able to directly treat greed, so it should correctly take non-greed as its nature. The cause of greed is the pure appearance, which is removed by the power of contemplation, so it is said that non-greed is what the contemplation accords with.

Therefore, if one guards the ear faculty, one must first dwell in the contemplation of impurity.

How then can this contemplation universally take desire and form as objects?
['ZH_T29_1562_059:0672c02_6']	此難不然，勝無滅者能觀天色為不淨故，佛能觀佛微妙色身為不淨故，由是此觀定能遍緣欲色為境。	此難不然，勝無滅者能觀天色為不淨故，佛能觀佛微妙色身為不淨故，由是此觀定能遍緣欲色為境。	This objection is not valid, because one superior to Aniruddha can contemplate the heavenly bodies as impure, and because the Buddha can contemplate his own subtle physical body as impure. Consequently, this contemplation can universally take desire and form as objects.
