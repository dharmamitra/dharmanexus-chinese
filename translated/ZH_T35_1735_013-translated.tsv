He came from other directions and embodied myriad virtues. He subdued demons and controlled outsiders with difficult-to-conceive eloquence. His transformations filled the dust and his functions pervaded the three periods of time. His Way was accomplished in a past eon, and he was already called the Honored King of the Dragon Species. He manifested the realization of enlightenment and was again called the Jeweled Accumulations. He truly is the mother of the Buddhas of the three times.

['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596a25_5']	然釋此偈，有通有別，通者此明菩提超情，別謂顯前光中所見之事。	然釋此偈，有通有別，通者此明菩提超情，別謂顯前光中所見之事。	However, in explaining this verse, there is the general and the specific. The general meaning is that this clarifies that enlightenment transcends conceptual mind. The specific meaning is to reveal the events seen in the light as mentioned above.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596a25_10']	於中又二：	於中又二：	Within this, there are two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596a26_6']	一約境，謂融前所照，顯理法故。	一約境，謂融前所照，顯理法故。	First, in terms of the object, it means to subsume what was illuminated before and reveal the principle of the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596a27_10']	二約觀，謂令大眾泯絕諸見，於所照事不生執取。	二約觀，謂令大眾泯絕諸見，於所照事不生執取。	Second, in terms of contemplation, it means to cause the great assembly to eliminate all views and not give rise to attachment to the events that were illuminated.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596a28_14']	然觀資理成、理由觀顯，故通而釋之即明菩提超情。	然觀資理成、理由觀顯，故通而釋之即明菩提超情。	However, contemplation relies on principle to be accomplished, and principle is revealed by means of contemplation. Therefore, the general explanation clarifies that enlightenment transcends conceptual mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596a29_1']	大分為二：	大分為二：	It is broadly divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596a29_11']	初一反顯、餘九順釋。	初一反顯、餘九順釋。	The first verse indirectly shows, and the remaining nine verses explain in accordance with the principle.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b01_11']	今初，反顯違理之失，謂菩提體德超絕一切。	今初，反顯違理之失，謂菩提體德超絕一切。	First, the opposite shows the fault of contradicting reason, namely, the essence of enlightenment is endowed with virtues that surpass everything.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b02_13']	《佛地論》明佛非漏非無漏，亦應於世非著非無著。	《佛地論》明佛非漏非無漏，亦應於世非著非無著。	The Buddha Land Treatise clarifies that the Buddha is neither contaminated nor uncontaminated, and should also be neither attached to the world nor unattached.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b04_18']	今乃見佛內離諸漏、外不著世，則有漏可離、有世不著，取捨未亡，此見違理，故非道眼。	今乃見佛內離諸漏、外不著世，則有漏可離、有世不著，取捨未亡，此見違理，故非道眼。	Now, if one sees the Buddha as internally free from defilements and externally unattached to the world, then there would be defilements to be abandoned and a world to be unattached to, with acceptance and rejection not yet extinguished. This view contradicts reason and is therefore not the eye of the Way.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b05_8']	證道眼者，無分別故。	證道眼者，無分別故。	The eye of the Way of realization is free from discrimination.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b06_10']	餘偈順顯見理之益，皆上三句觀相、下句觀益。	餘偈順顯見理之益，皆上三句觀相、下句觀益。	The remaining verses affirm the benefits of seeing the truth, all with the first three lines being the aspects of contemplation and the last line being the benefits of contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b07_6']	於中九偈各是一義，且分為四：	於中九偈各是一義，且分為四：	Among them, each of the nine verses has one meaning, and are roughly divided into four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b08_6']	初六觀佛、次一趣求、次一觀生、後一了法。	初六觀佛、次一趣求、次一觀生、後一了法。	The first six contemplate the Buddha, the next one seeks, the next one contemplates birth, and the last one understands the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b09_13']	初中，初偈正顯佛菩提性本來自空，稱此而知，則無上失。	初中，初偈正顯佛菩提性本來自空，稱此而知，則無上失。	In the first, the first verse correctly shows that the nature of the Buddha's enlightenment is originally empty by itself. If one knows according to this, there is no supreme loss.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b10_14']	體謂真性、相謂德相，並性無所有，竟何所離？	體謂真性、相謂德相，並性無所有，竟何所離？	Essence refers to true nature, and characteristics refers to virtuous characteristics. Since both are essentially non-existent, what is there to be separated from?
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b11_4']	本無有著，誰為無著？	本無有著，誰為無著？	Originally there is no attachment, so who is without attachment?
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b12_4']	如是知者名為正解，修習明了斯為正行。	如是知者名為正解，修習明了斯為正行。	One who knows in this way is called right understanding, and clearly cultivating and practicing this is called right practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b12_9']	下句觀益。	下句觀益。	The next line is the benefit of contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b13_10']	言疾作佛者，約文殊門，情盡理現即名作佛；	言疾作佛者，約文殊門，情盡理現即名作佛；	As for quickly becoming a buddha, according to the Manjushri approach, when emotions are exhausted and principle manifests, it is called becoming a buddha;
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b14_1']	約普賢門，信終圓收；	約普賢門，信終圓收；	according to the Samantabhadra approach, when faith is complete and inclusive;
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b14_17']	約行布說，則不見此理，成佛未期。	約行布說，則不見此理，成佛未期。	according to the approach of systematic arrangement, one does not see this principle, and the time of becoming a buddha is not yet determined.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b15_2']	他皆倣此。	他皆倣此。	The others all follow this.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b16_1']	次一偈依正等觀，佛菩提性依正無二故。	次一偈依正等觀，佛菩提性依正無二故。	The next verse is the contemplation of the equality of the Dharma realm, the Buddha's enlightenment nature, the environment and the beings, which are non-dual.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b16_13']	亦顯光所照處，以明離見。	亦顯光所照處，以明離見。	It also shows that where the light shines, it clarifies the transcendence of views.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b18_1']	謂上半於前所見世界，令離妄動，知真法界不應動故。	謂上半於前所見世界，令離妄動，知真法界不應動故。	The first half of the verse, regarding the previously seen world, makes one transcend false movement, knowing that the true Dharma realm should not move.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b19_6']	次句例前八相，佛身亦同，平等不動而了，故成勝智。	次句例前八相，佛身亦同，平等不動而了，故成勝智。	The next line gives the example of the previous eight appearances of the Buddha's body, which are also the same, equal, and unmoving, and thus perfect wisdom is accomplished.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b20_13']	次偈佛法等觀了同體故，二念豈生、一亦不存，得難思果。	次偈佛法等觀了同體故，二念豈生、一亦不存，得難思果。	Next verse: The Buddha and Dharma are equally observed, realizing the same essence, so how can two thoughts arise? Even one does not remain, attaining the inconceivable fruition.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b23_6']	次偈生佛等觀，言身即眾生，以梵本中云佛及我故，我即行人之身，稱理普周云平等住，平等則無能所，故曰無住。	次偈生佛等觀，言身即眾生，以梵本中云佛及我故，我即行人之身，稱理普周云平等住，平等則無能所，故曰無住。	Next verse: The Buddha and sentient beings are equally observed. The body is precisely sentient beings, because in the Sanskrit text it says Buddha and I. I am the body of the practitioner. In accordance with principle, it is all-pervading, called abiding in equality. Equality is without subject or object, therefore it is called no abiding.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b23_16']	我即法性，更不證入。	我即法性，更不證入。	I am precisely the nature of dharmas, not realizing and entering again.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b24_6']	法性無性，復何所入？	法性無性，復何所入？	The nature of dharmas has no nature, so what is there to enter?
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b27_6']	如是知者，曠世難逢，故《般若》文殊分云「若知我性即知無法，若知無法即無境界，若無境界即無所依，若無所依即無所住」也。	如是知者，曠世難逢，故《般若》文殊分云「若知我性即知無法，若知無法即無境界，若無境界即無所依，若無所依即無所住」也。	Knowing this is difficult to encounter in the vast world. Therefore, in the Prajnaparamita Sutra, the chapter on Manjushri says, If you know the nature of self, you know there are no dharmas. If you know there are no dharmas, there is no objective realm. If there is no objective realm, there is no basis. If there is no basis, there is no abiding.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b28_4']	又本會即住無所住，新集則入無所入。	又本會即住無所住，新集則入無所入。	Moreover, the original assembly abides in the unobtainable, while the newly gathered enter the unobtainable.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b28_6']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b29_1']	若皆平等，云何分別有三寶耶？	若皆平等，云何分別有三寶耶？	If they are all equal, how can one distinguish the Three Jewels?
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b29_8']	《智論》答云：	《智論》答云：	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom answers:
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596b29_15']	平等即是三寶。	平等即是三寶。	Equality is precisely the Three Jewels.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c01_14']	謂平等即法寶，法寶即是佛，以未得法不名佛故。	謂平等即法寶，法寶即是佛，以未得法不名佛故。	That is to say, equality is precisely the Jewel of the Dharma. The Jewel of the Dharma is precisely the Buddha, because without attaining the Dharma one is not called a Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c02_9']	得平等法，分別有須菩提等。	得平等法，分別有須菩提等。	Having attained the Dharma of equality, there are distinctions such as Subhūti and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c03_18']	次偈會通平等，謂上來主伴依正不離五蘊，五蘊性空即是平等。	次偈會通平等，謂上來主伴依正不離五蘊，五蘊性空即是平等。	The next verse unifies equality, which means that the host, the retinue, the dependent, and the correct are not apart from the five aggregates. The five aggregates are empty by nature, which is precisely equality.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c05_8']	有相差別總名為數，即同無為故非數法，離數超世成寂靜果。	有相差別總名為數，即同無為故非數法，離數超世成寂靜果。	Having characteristics and distinctions are collectively called numbers, which are the same as the unconditioned, and therefore are not conditioned dharmas. Being apart from numbers and transcending the world, one attains the fruit of tranquility.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c06_17']	次偈拂上出世，謂真出世者超越入出、不礙照知，故成光耀。	次偈拂上出世，謂真出世者超越入出、不礙照知，故成光耀。	The next verse brushes away the above worldly transcendence, which means that the true world-transcender transcends entering and exiting, and is unobstructed in illuminating and knowing, and therefore attains radiance.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c07_8']	又上第三偈佛即是法。	又上第三偈佛即是法。	Moreover, in the third verse above, the Buddha is precisely the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c07_16']	第四偈法即是眾。	第四偈法即是眾。	In the fourth verse, the Dharma is precisely the Saṅgha.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c08_16']	第五偈明是三寶皆無為相，此偈與虛空等。	第五偈明是三寶皆無為相，此偈與虛空等。	The fifth verse clarifies that these Three Jewels all have the characteristics of the unconditioned, and this verse is equal to space.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c10_8']	二有一偈趣求者，以上雖離見而知，猶恐帶寂，故上半勸求。	二有一偈趣求者，以上雖離見而知，猶恐帶寂，故上半勸求。	The second has one verse on those who seek. Although the above is free from views and knowledge, it is still feared that it may bring about quiescence, so the first half encourages seeking.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c11_14']	次句又觀性離，謂了迴向心本自不生，是離相迴向也。	次句又觀性離，謂了迴向心本自不生，是離相迴向也。	The next line also observes the nature as being apart from, meaning understanding that the mind of dedication is originally unborn, which is the dedication of the characteristics of separation.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c12_6']	離相求佛，得名稱果。	離相求佛，得名稱果。	Separating from characteristics to seek the Buddha, one attains the fruit of fame.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c13_16']	三次一偈，所見眾生亦皆稱真，故無生壞，知無眾生是無上道故。	三次一偈，所見眾生亦皆稱真，故無生壞，知無眾生是無上道故。	Third, there is one verse. The sentient beings seen are also all in accordance with truth, so there is no birth or destruction. Knowing that there are no sentient beings is the unsurpassed path.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c14_13']	下經云「無上摩訶薩，遠離眾生想。	下經云「無上摩訶薩，遠離眾生想。	The later sutra says, The unsurpassed Mahāsattva is far removed from the notion of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c15_9']	」末後一偈知法，即成前法會周遍所由。	」末後一偈知法，即成前法會周遍所由。	The last verse knows the Dharma, which completes the reason for the thorough pervasion of the Dharma assembly in the previous section.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c16_9']	上半標門，即十玄門中一多相容不同門也。	上半標門，即十玄門中一多相容不同門也。	The first half presents the gate, which is the gate of mutual inclusion of one and many among the ten mysteries.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c17_10']	次一句釋所由，即十種所由中緣起相由門也。	次一句釋所由，即十種所由中緣起相由門也。	The next line explains the reason, which is the gate of conditioned arising and mutual dependence among the ten reasons.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c18_7']	並如義分齊中謂一與多互相生起。	並如義分齊中謂一與多互相生起。	Both are as in the section on the division of meanings, which means that one and many mutually give rise to each other.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c19_13']	且一依多起，則一是所起而無力也，多是能起故有力也。	且一依多起，則一是所起而無力也，多是能起故有力也。	Moreover, if one depends on many to arise, then one is that which arises and lacks power, while many are that which gives rise and has power.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c21_1']	以多有力能攝一，以一無力入於多，是故此一恒在多中；	以多有力能攝一，以一無力入於多，是故此一恒在多中；	Because many have power, they can include one. Because one lacks power, it enters into many. Therefore, this one always exists within many.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c22_2']	多依一起準上知之，是則此多恒在一中也。	多依一起準上知之，是則此多恒在一中也。	The standard for many depending on one to arise can be known from the above. This means that many always exist within one.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c23_4']	以俱有力及俱無力各不並故，無彼不相在也；	以俱有力及俱無力各不並故，無彼不相在也；	Because having power and lacking power do not occur simultaneously, there is no mutual non-existence.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c24_5']	以一有力一無力不相違故，有此恒相在也。	以一有力一無力不相違故，有此恒相在也。	Because one having power and one lacking power are not contradictory, there is this constant mutual existence.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c25_4']	緣起法界理數常爾，稱斯而見何所畏哉？	緣起法界理數常爾，稱斯而見何所畏哉？	The principle of the Dharma realm of dependent origination is always thus. If one sees in accordance with this, what is there to fear?
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c27_3', 'ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c28_8']	由此緣起成前平等，由前平等成此緣起，文理昭然，不許事事無礙，恐未著深思。🔽第二重光照十方各十佛土者，是娑婆隣次之十剎也。	由此緣起成前平等，由前平等成此緣起，文理昭然，不許事事無礙，恐未著深思。🔽第二重光照十方各十佛土者，是娑婆隣次之十剎也。	Based on this dependent origination, the previous equality is established. Based on the previous equality, this dependent origination is established. The text and principle are clear. If one does not accept the unobstructedness of all phenomena, one may not yet have deeply contemplated this.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0596c29_1']	十偈通顯菩提因果，分三：	十偈通顯菩提因果，分三：	The ten verses generally reveal the causes and effects of bodhi, divided into three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a01_3']	初偈菩提之因、次五菩提果用、後四令物思齊。	初偈菩提之因、次五菩提果用、後四令物思齊。	The first verse is the cause of bodhi, the next five are the functions of the fruit of bodhi, and the last four encourage beings to aspire to equality.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a01_6']	今初。	今初。	Now, the first.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a03_7']	上半所為，謂無明造業，愛能潤業，故生死無窮，如泥中刺不覺其傷，如瘡中刺為其所毒。	上半所為，謂無明造業，愛能潤業，故生死無窮，如泥中刺不覺其傷，如瘡中刺為其所毒。	The first half is what is done, namely, ignorance creates karma, and craving can moisten karma, thus birth and death are endless, like a thorn in mud not realizing it is a wound, like a thorn in a sore being poisoned by it.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a05_4']	下半能為，即從癡有愛，菩薩悲生，非大菩提莫之能拔，無此悲智非佛法故。	下半能為，即從癡有愛，菩薩悲生，非大菩提莫之能拔，無此悲智非佛法故。	The second half is what is able to do, namely, from delusion there is craving, the bodhisattva's compassion arises, without great bodhi it cannot be pulled out, without this compassion and wisdom it is not the Buddha Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a06_11']	次五菩提果用中，初偈悲智雙滿，智見諸法、悲以轉授。	次五菩提果用中，初偈悲智雙滿，智見諸法、悲以轉授。	Among the next five verses on the functions of the fruit of bodhi, the first verse is the complete fulfillment of compassion and wisdom, wisdom sees all dharmas, compassion is used to transform and bestow.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a11_10']	普見通於性相故離二邊，謂真故無有、俗故無無，真故無有則雖無而有、俗故無無則雖有而無、雖有而無則不累於有、雖無而有則不滯於無，不滯於無則斷滅見息、不存於有則常著氷消，俱不俱等何由而有？	普見通於性相故離二邊，謂真故無有、俗故無無，真故無有則雖無而有、俗故無無則雖有而無、雖有而無則不累於有、雖無而有則不滯於無，不滯於無則斷滅見息、不存於有則常著氷消，俱不俱等何由而有？	Universally seeing penetrates both nature and characteristics, therefore it is free from the two extremes. That is to say, because of the true, there is no existence; because of the conventional, there is no non-existence. Because of the true, no existence means that although non-existent, it exists; because of the conventional, no non-existence means that although existent, it does not exist. Although existent, it does not exist, so it does not accumulate in existence; although non-existent, it exists, so it does not stagnate in non-existence. Not stagnating in non-existence means the view of annihilation ceases; not dwelling in existence means the attachment to permanence melts away. How can there be existence and non-existence, both and neither, and so forth?
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a11_19']	諸邊都寂故云皆離。	諸邊都寂故云皆離。	All extremes are completely still, therefore it is said they are all left behind.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a13_13']	次一美往因行、次一慈力降魔、次一智斷致用、後一法鼓警機，文相並顯。	次一美往因行、次一慈力降魔、次一智斷致用、後一法鼓警機，文相並顯。	The next verse praises past practices, the next verse uses compassionate power to subdue demons, the next verse uses wisdom and elimination to achieve function, and the last verse uses the Dharma drum to warn those with potential. The textual characteristics are all evident.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a14_16']	後四令物思齊者，斯即佛因，能如是行得諸佛道。	後四令物思齊者，斯即佛因，能如是行得諸佛道。	The last four verses cause beings to think of equality. This is precisely the Buddha's causes. One can attain the path of all Buddhas by practicing like this.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a15_4']	四偈顯四種行：	四偈顯四種行：	The four verses manifest four kinds of practices:
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a16_12']	一游剎無著，謂不壞其相故能普游，了剎性空故於有無著。	一游剎無著，謂不壞其相故能普游，了剎性空故於有無著。	The first is wandering through lands without attachment. That is to say, because one does not destroy their characteristics, one is able to universally wander; because one understands the nature of lands to be empty, one is without attachment to existence and non-existence.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a17_1']	二念佛生喜。	二念佛生喜。	Second, mindfulness of the Buddha gives rise to joy.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a18_5']	上半所念法身顯故如空永常，解脫累亡如空清淨；	上半所念法身顯故如空永常，解脫累亡如空清淨；	The first half shows that the Dharma body that is contemplated is eternally constant like space, and liberation is free from bondage like space's purity;
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a19_1']	下半能念憶持明記，故喜生願足。	下半能念憶持明記，故喜生願足。	The second half is able to remember and uphold with clear recollection, therefore joy arises and aspirations are fulfilled.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a19_18']	三亡苦濟物、四護法輕身，文並可知。	三亡苦濟物、四護法輕身，文並可知。	Third, transcending suffering and delivering beings, and fourth, protecting the Dharma and regarding the body lightly, the texts are all understandable.
['ZH_T35_1735_013:0597a20_15']	第三重光照百界，偈中顯佛八相菩提。	第三重光照百界，偈中顯佛八相菩提。	The third time the light shines on a hundred realms, in the verses it shows the Buddha's eight aspects of enlightenment.
