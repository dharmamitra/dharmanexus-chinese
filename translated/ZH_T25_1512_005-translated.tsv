['ZH_T25_1512_005:0828a02_16']	十地行滿金剛心後，顯性本有名法佛，萬德智惠圓滿名報佛，於眾聖中王名為大身，體是無為常住而不同有為身，故借之為喻也。	十地行滿金剛心後，顯性本有名法佛，萬德智惠圓滿名報佛，於眾聖中王名為大身，體是無為常住而不同有為身，故借之為喻也。	005	After the perfection of the practices of the ten grounds and the adamantine mind, the originally existent nature is manifested and is called the Dharma Buddha. The perfect completion of myriad virtues and wisdom is called the reward-body Buddha. Being the king among the sages is called having a great body.

['ZH_T25_1512_005:0828b04_3']	故偈言「智習唯識通」者，第八阿梨耶識，通明十地菩薩無漏真解佛果智慧方能通遠，見此淨土，得此土用故。	故偈言「智習唯識通」者，第八阿梨耶識，通明十地菩薩無漏真解佛果智慧方能通遠，見此淨土，得此土用故。	005	Therefore, the verse says The wisdom of cultivating only consciousness refers to the eighth ālaya consciousness. It is clearly said that only bodhisattvas of the ten grounds and the pure wisdom of the Buddha's fruition can penetrate and see this pure land and obtain the function of this land.

['ZH_T25_1512_005:0830b16_19']	「若是經典所在之處」者，明持經人即是經取住處也。	「若是經典所在之處」者，明持經人即是經取住處也。	005	Wherever this sutra is means that the person who upholds the sutra is the place where the sutra is kept.

In the latter age, if there are people who follow the Buddha's intention and uphold the sutra, it is no different from the Buddha.
['ZH_T25_1512_005:0830b23_7']	此人雖是凡夫不名為佛，而流通大乘、說法化人，生解斷或、證於聖果，分同於佛，故勸供養如佛也。	此人雖是凡夫不名為佛，而流通大乘、說法化人，生解斷或、證於聖果，分同於佛，故勸供養如佛也。	005	Although this person is an ordinary person and is not called the Buddha, they spread the Mahayana, expound the Dharma to transform people, give rise to understanding and cut off or attain the holy fruit, and share the same status as the Buddha. Therefore, it is encouraged to make offerings to them as if they were the Buddha.

It clarifies that great beings among bodhisattvas, in terms of wisdom, eliminating afflictions, expounding the Dharma, transforming beings, and benefiting themselves and others, also partially possess the wisdom of omniscience and partially awaken like a Buddha, and therefore they are called those who resemble a Buddha.
['ZH_T25_1512_005:0830b29_17']	明此持經人化物功齊菩薩故，勸供養持經人如供養菩薩，故云尊重似佛也。	明此持經人化物功齊菩薩故，勸供養持經人如供養菩薩，故云尊重似佛也。	005	It clarifies that the merit of this person who upholds the sutra in transforming beings is equal to that of a bodhisattva, and therefore it encourages making offerings to the person who upholds the sutra as if making offerings to a bodhisattva, and thus it says respecting those who resemble a Buddha.

The eternally abiding empty Dharma body of the past and present, whether cultivating the practices of the ten grounds or not, cannot be seen with form and marks. Because these thirty-two marks of a great man are not the marks of the Dharma body, it is said that they are not marks.

This directly brings out the meaning of the analogy, to clarify that the merit of giving the seven treasures is the defilement of afflictions. Therefore, it explains the two analogies of the world of微塵.

Because this pure and undefiled merit and virtue can only serve as the cause for the marks of a great man of the reward body Buddha, it cannot serve as the cause for the enlightenment of the Dharma body Buddha. Therefore, upholding the sūtra is upholding the enlightenment of the Dharma body Buddha. Therefore, the blessings of upholding the sūtra surpass the causes of the marks of a great man.

Therefore, I say that the marks of a great man's cultivation and attainment are only the marks of the reward-body Buddha, not the marks of the Dharma-body.

It clarifies that although followers of the Lesser Vehicle observe the emptiness of the selflessness of dharmas and persons in conditioned and unconditioned [phenomena], they have not yet attained the essence of conditioned and unconditioned dharmas and the emptiness of the true nature of dharmas, so he only speaks of attaining the wisdom eye and does not discuss attaining the Dharma eye.

['ZH_T25_1512_005:0836a13_18']	「何況為法捨」者，明直世間果報捨身命者，不如持經之福可小，何況復為無上菩提法故取相心捨，亦不及持經福也。	「何況為法捨」者，明直世間果報捨身命者，不如持經之福可小，何況復為無上菩提法故取相心捨，亦不及持經福也。	005	How much more so for the sake of the Dharma means that the merit of upholding the sūtra is not small compared to the merit of giving up one's body and life for worldly rewards, how much more so if one gives up with a conceptual mind for the sake of the Dharma of unsurpassed enlightenment, that merit is also not equal to upholding the sūtra.

['ZH_T25_1512_005:0836b03_16']	「是故彼福德中此福勝」者，是內外捨中無此八種功德，依此經中有八種功德故。	「是故彼福德中此福勝」者，是內外捨中無此八種功德，依此經中有八種功德故。	005	Therefore, among those merits, this merit is superior means that among internal and external abandonment, there are not these eight kinds of merits.
