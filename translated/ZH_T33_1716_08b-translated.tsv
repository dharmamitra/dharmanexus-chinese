['ZH_T33_1716_08b:0784b21_12']	一切有為，無常、苦、空、無我，能發得煗、頂、世第一法，發真無漏因，用真修道。	一切有為，無常、苦、空、無我，能發得煗、頂、世第一法，發真無漏因，用真修道。	08b	All conditioned phenomena are impermanent, suffering, empty, and without self, able to give rise to the dharmas of heat, summit, and world-first, giving rise to the true undefiled causes, using the true cultivation of the path.

['ZH_T33_1716_08b:0784b29_6']	二、空門者，即是彼教析正因緣，無明老死，苦集二諦，三假浮虛，破假實，悉入空平等，發真無漏，因空見真，空即第一義之門也。	二、空門者，即是彼教析正因緣，無明老死，苦集二諦，三假浮虛，破假實，悉入空平等，發真無漏，因空見真，空即第一義之門也。	08b	Second, the emptiness approach is the teaching that analyzes the twelve links of dependent origination, from ignorance to old age and death, the two truths of suffering and its origin, the three provisional natures, and refutes the real nature, all entering into the equality of emptiness, giving rise to true and undefiled wisdom. Seeing the truth through emptiness, emptiness is the gateway to the ultimate truth.

This is the gate to the ultimate truth.

After attaining the path by contemplating the emptiness of birth in the three vehicles, one further contemplates the emptiness of dharmas. The two realms of birth and dharmas are not fused.
