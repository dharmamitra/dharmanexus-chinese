They disparage Pure Land practice as provisional teachings and ridicule recitation and upholding as coarse practices. Aren't they addicted to the decaying house, content to sink and wander forever, and rebellious against their kind mother, deeply grieving the empty loss of a lifetime?

Teaching reveals the principle, relying on the principle to give rise to practice, and by practice one attains the fruition.

['ZH_T37_1761_001:0356c10_7']	「彼國眾生無有眾苦。	「彼國眾生無有眾苦。	001	The sentient beings in that land are free from all suffering.

['ZH_T37_1761_001:0356c17_7']	次、辨教相。	次、辨教相。	001	Next, to discern the characteristics of the teaching.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0356c19_6']	淨土教觀通明現在十方諸佛，即如下引，六方恒沙諸佛出廣長舌勸信是經，即其證也。	淨土教觀通明現在十方諸佛，即如下引，六方恒沙諸佛出廣長舌勸信是經，即其證也。	001	The teachings and contemplations of the Pure Land clearly explain the Buddhas of the ten directions in the present, as can be seen in the following passage where the Buddhas of the six directions and Ganges sands extend their tongues to encourage faith in this sutra.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0356c22_4']	又準下文，善男、善女聞經受持，不歷階漸皆不退轉阿耨菩提，故知一切淨土教門，皆是大乘圓頓成佛之法，定非偏小，如別委論。	又準下文，善男、善女聞經受持，不歷階漸皆不退轉阿耨菩提，故知一切淨土教門，皆是大乘圓頓成佛之法，定非偏小，如別委論。	001	Moreover, according to the following passage, good men and good women who hear the sutra and uphold it will not go through the stages but will all attain irreversible anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Therefore, we know that all the teachings of the Pure Land are the methods for attaining Buddhahood through the perfect and sudden Mahayana, and are definitely not partial or inferior. This can be discussed in detail elsewhere.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0356c22_20']	二、明理者，理即教體，亦分為二：	二、明理者，理即教體，亦分為二：	001	Second, clarifying the principle. The principle is the essence of the teachings and can be divided into two parts:
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0356c23_5']	初、通，二、別。	初、通，二、別。	001	First, general; second, specific.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0356c27_7']	初中，一切大乘皆以方等實相為體，方謂方廣，等即平等，實相妙理橫遍諸法故名方廣，竪該凡聖故言平等，故知橫竪一切諸法悉自緣生，皆不思議無非實相，此通一代大乘所詮之理。	初中，一切大乘皆以方等實相為體，方謂方廣，等即平等，實相妙理橫遍諸法故名方廣，竪該凡聖故言平等，故知橫竪一切諸法悉自緣生，皆不思議無非實相，此通一代大乘所詮之理。	001	First, all Mahayana teachings take the true aspect of Vaipulya as their essence. Vaipulya means vast and extensive, and true aspect refers to the wondrous principle that extends horizontally to all dharmas, thus called vast and extensive, and extends vertically to ordinary beings and sages, thus called equality. Therefore, know that all dharmas, horizontally and vertically, are all self-originated and inconceivable, none of which is not the true aspect. This is the principle expounded in all Mahayana teachings.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a02_7']	二、言別者，今經即以彌陀修因感果，依正莊嚴不思議功德為所詮理，良以因中發無相大願，修無住妙行，感無得聖果，點事如理，相即非相，故所感身土無非實相，即下經云：	二、言別者，今經即以彌陀修因感果，依正莊嚴不思議功德為所詮理，良以因中發無相大願，修無住妙行，感無得聖果，點事如理，相即非相，故所感身土無非實相，即下經云：	001	Second, the specific meaning is that this sutra takes Amitabha's cultivation of causes and attainment of effects, the inconceivable merits of the adornments of the依正, as the principle it expounds. The reason is that in the causal stage, he gave rise to the great vow of no characteristics, cultivated the wondrous practice of no abiding, and attained the holy fruit of no attainment. Pointing to phenomena as suchness, characteristics are none other than non-characteristics. Therefore, the body and land he attained are all the true aspect. As the sutra says below:
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a03_18']	「如我今者讚歎阿彌陀佛不可思議功德」，若非妙理，那稱不思議乎？	「如我今者讚歎阿彌陀佛不可思議功德」，若非妙理，那稱不思議乎？	001	Just as I now praise Amitabha Buddha's inconceivable merits. If it were not the wondrous principle, how could it be called inconceivable?
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a04_12']	三、明行者，行即教宗，亦有通別。	三、明行者，行即教宗，亦有通別。	001	Third, clarifying the practice, practice refers to the teachings and principles, which also have general and specific aspects.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a06_1']	初、通明大行，不出發無上道心、修六度萬行，備在眾經，不復具舉。	初、通明大行，不出發無上道心、修六度萬行，備在眾經，不復具舉。	001	First, generally clarifying the great practice, it does not go beyond arousing the mind of supreme enlightenment and cultivating the six perfections and myriad practices, which are all included in the various sūtras and will not be repeated here.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a07_4']	二、別論者，修行淨業感生淨土，別是一門出離徑術。	二、別論者，修行淨業感生淨土，別是一門出離徑術。	001	Second, for specific discussion, cultivating pure practices and responding to rebirth in the Pure Land is a separate gate and the direct method for liberation.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a13_6']	就淨業中復有多種，諸經所示行法各殊，《觀經》三福妙觀，《大本》一日一夜懸繒幡蓋，十日十夜奉持齋戒，《大悲經》中一日稱名展轉相勸，《般舟經》中一日若過，繫念現前，九十日中恒不坐臥，《鼓音聲經》十日十夜六時禮念，《陀羅尼集》誦諸神呪，《大法鼓經》但作生意知有彼佛。	就淨業中復有多種，諸經所示行法各殊，《觀經》三福妙觀，《大本》一日一夜懸繒幡蓋，十日十夜奉持齋戒，《大悲經》中一日稱名展轉相勸，《般舟經》中一日若過，繫念現前，九十日中恒不坐臥，《鼓音聲經》十日十夜六時禮念，《陀羅尼集》誦諸神呪，《大法鼓經》但作生意知有彼佛。	001	Within the pure practices, there are also many kinds. The practices shown in various sūtras are different. The Contemplation Sūtra teaches the three kinds of merit and wonderful contemplation, the Larger Sūtra teaches hanging silk banners and canopies for one day and night, and for ten days and ten nights observing the precepts and upholding the precepts, the Sūtra of Great Compassion teaches calling the name for one day and encouraging each other, the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra teaches for one day or more, focusing the mind and appearing before [Amitābha], not sitting or lying down for ninety days, the Sūtra of the Sound of the Drum teaches for ten days and ten nights, paying homage and reciting at the six periods, the Dhāraṇī Collection teaches reciting various divine spells, and the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum teaches merely giving rise to the intention and knowing the existence of that Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a14_5']	權巧赴機行法不一，教門雖異無不往生。	權巧赴機行法不一，教門雖異無不往生。	001	The skillful means in accord with capacities have many different practices. Although the teachings are different, they all lead to rebirth.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a15_14']	今經專示持名之法，正是經宗，於今為要，故當委示，不可籠通。	今經專示持名之法，正是經宗，於今為要，故當委示，不可籠通。	001	This sūtra specifically teaches the practice of chanting the name, which is precisely the main theme of the sūtra, and is essential for the present time. Therefore, it should be thoroughly explained, and cannot be generalized.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a16_3']	括束經文且為五例：	括束經文且為五例：	001	Summarizing the sūtra's meaning, there are roughly five categories:
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a16_15']	一、心起忻厭，厭苦忻樂；	一、心起忻厭，厭苦忻樂；	001	First, the mind gives rise to aversion and delight, averting suffering and delighting in bliss;
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a17_4']	二、身須西向，正立合掌；	二、身須西向，正立合掌；	001	Second, the body needs to face west, stand upright with palms joined;
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a17_16']	三、克期日限，一日七日；	三、克期日限，一日七日；	001	Third, set a date limit, one day or seven days;
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a18_6']	四、繫心佛境，專一不亂；	四、繫心佛境，專一不亂；	001	Fourth, focus the mind on the Buddha's realm, single-minded and undisturbed;
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a19_16']	五、期死無退，決誓求脫，若此稱名下至十念尚得往生，況一日七日乎？	五、期死無退，決誓求脫，若此稱名下至十念尚得往生，況一日七日乎？	001	Fifth, vow to die without retreating, resolutely seeking liberation. If one recites the name in this way, even ten recitations will lead to rebirth, let alone one day or seven days.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a20_12']	四、明果者，果即教用，亦有二別：	四、明果者，果即教用，亦有二別：	001	Fourth, clarifying the fruition. The fruition is the function of the teaching, and there are also two distinctions:
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a20_21']	一者、近果，經云：	一者、近果，經云：	001	First, the proximate fruition. The sutra says:
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a23_10']	「是人終時心不顛倒，即得往生極樂世界」，由前稱佛結業成因，捨此穢苦感彼淨樂，即獲法性淨身，住同居淨土也。	「是人終時心不顛倒，即得往生極樂世界」，由前稱佛結業成因，捨此穢苦感彼淨樂，即獲法性淨身，住同居淨土也。	001	At the end of this person's life, their mind is not deluded, and they immediately attain rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. This is because the previous recitation of the Buddha's name forms the cause of karma, averting this defiled suffering and evoking that pure bliss. One then attains the pure body of dharma-nature and abides in the pure land of shared enjoyment.
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a23_19']	二者、遠果，下云：	二者、遠果，下云：	001	Second, the distant fruition. The text below says:
['ZH_T37_1761_001:0357a26_10']	「眾生生者，皆得不退阿耨菩提」，此謂生彼國已，聞法得忍，修菩提道斷惑，證真究竟成佛，即證清淨法身，居法性土也。	「眾生生者，皆得不退阿耨菩提」，此謂生彼國已，聞法得忍，修菩提道斷惑，證真究竟成佛，即證清淨法身，居法性土也。	001	All sentient beings born there will attain irreversibility from supreme, perfect enlightenment, means that after being born in that land, hearing the Dharma, attaining forbearance, cultivating the path to enlightenment, severing afflictions, realizing truth, and ultimately becoming a Buddha, one will realize the pure Dharma body and dwell in the Dharma nature land.
