Therefore, in the desire realm, suffering is retained in the end. There are a total of thirty-one cycles of reducing objects and reducing practices. Later, there is only one practice and two moments of mind that contemplate the suffering of the desire realm, called the completion of middling patience. There is only one practice and one moment of mind that contemplates the suffering of the desire realm, called the accomplishment of upper patience.

Therefore, in the middle forbearance one fully cultivates the sixteen, twelve, eight, and four aspects. In the upper forbearance one also cultivates the four aspects. Although one gives rise to one aspect in one moment of mind, because one contemplates suffering, one is able to give rise to and cultivate the four aspects of the lower suffering.
