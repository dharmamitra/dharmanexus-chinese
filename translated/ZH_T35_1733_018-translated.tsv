Therefore, those dharmas are not what this [bodhisattva] can cultivate. Because of being unable to cultivate them as causes and conditions,

['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453a28_11']	二功德雲已去，有善財往求，顯位成故、根漸勝故、已發心故，知識不就，顯法重人尊故。	二功德雲已去，有善財往求，顯位成故、根漸勝故、已發心故，知識不就，顯法重人尊故。	018	Second, after G59903 devarāja, there are those whom Sudhana seeks out, showing the accomplishment of the stage, the gradual excellence of faculties, and the arousal of the mind. The knowledge-teachers do not come to him, showing the Dharma to be weighty and the person to be honored.

['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b08_15']	三是離增減義，如日東出西沒是增減相，南離二邊，表中道法界。	三是離增減義，如日東出西沒是增減相，南離二邊，表中道法界。	018	Third, it is the meaning of being free from increase and decrease. The sun rising in the east and setting in the west is the appearance of increase and decrease. South is free from the two extremes, symbolizing the Dharma realm of the middle way.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b10_1']	四是生義，謂南主其陽是其生義，北主其陰是滅義。	四是生義，謂南主其陽是其生義，北主其陰是滅義。	018	Fourth, it is the meaning of arising. South is the yang, which has the meaning of arising, and north is the yin, which has the meaning of cessation.

The Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, with the golden coffin with its head facing north, symbolizes the meaning of cessation.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b13_7']	於此四中，前二後一地前表之，其離增減義地後表之，地中正證離相故不可南表。	於此四中，前二後一地前表之，其離增減義地後表之，地中正證離相故不可南表。	018	Among these four, the first two and the last one are symbolized before the grounds. The meaning of being free from increase and decrease is symbolized after the grounds. Because the correct realization within the grounds is free from characteristics, it cannot be symbolized by south.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b14_1']	地後顯業用，不同地內也。	地後顯業用，不同地內也。	018	The subsequent manifestation of karmic activity is different from that within the grounds.

['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b17_4']	初三賢未證散在諸處；	初三賢未證散在諸處；	018	First, the three virtuous ones have not yet realized and are scattered in various places;
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b18_3']	二地上證真生在佛家，故多佛眾中等；	二地上證真生在佛家，故多佛眾中等；	018	Second, those on the grounds realize the truth and are born in the Buddha's family, so they are mostly among the Buddha's assembly;
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b18_13']	三地後起用亦散隨緣；	三地後起用亦散隨緣；	018	Third, after the grounds, they give rise to function and also scatter according to conditions;
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b19_8']	四普賢表因圓剋果，亦在佛所。	四普賢表因圓剋果，亦在佛所。	018	Fourth, Samantabhadra represents the completion of causes and attaining the fruition, also being in the Buddha's presence.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b19_16']	五遣不遣中有二：	五遣不遣中有二：	018	Fifth, in the section on sending and not sending, there are two:

['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b21_16']	初謂文殊自往就故無人教，後普賢遍故眼開自見又至。	初謂文殊自往就故無人教，後普賢遍故眼開自見又至。	018	The first is because Mañjuśrī himself goes to them, so there is no one to teach. The last is because Samantabhadra is omnipresent, so with the opening of the eyes one sees and arrives on one's own.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b22_14']	後文殊般若智成，自見法界故不待教；	後文殊般若智成，自見法界故不待教；	018	Later, the wisdom of Mañjuśrī's prajñā is accomplished, and one sees the Dharma realm on one's own, so there is no need for teaching;
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b23_8', 'ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b24_9']	餘位無此二義，皆有教遣。🔽又若不教遣，即諸知識獨著於己，何成自行？	餘位無此二義，皆有教遣。 又若不教遣，即諸知識獨著於己，何成自行？	018	The other stages do not have these two meanings and all have teaching to send.🔽Moreover, if there is no teaching to send, then the various good and wise advisors would be exclusive to oneself, how could it be one's own practice?
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b25_10']	又唯言知，一若不遣，餘求何成圓備之益？	又唯言知，一若不遣，餘求何成圓備之益？	018	Moreover, if one only speaks of knowing and does not send, how can the rest achieve the benefit of completeness?
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b26_5']	又若不遣，豈合一位不進昇後？	又若不遣，豈合一位不進昇後？	018	Moreover, if one does not send, how could it accord with not progressing to the later stages in one stage?
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b26_12']	六歎不歎中三：	六歎不歎中三：	018	Sixth, in the section on praising and not praising, there are three:
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b28_1']	初文殊亦歎亦不歎，謂善財未發心，但勸令發心，故不歎；	初文殊亦歎亦不歎，謂善財未發心，但勸令發心，故不歎；	018	In the first passage, Mañjuśrī both praises and does not praise. This means that Sudhana had not yet given rise to the mind [of enlightenment], so he was only encouraged to give rise to the mind, thus he was not praised;
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453b29_17']	後勸令發心已，方乃歎之，中間知識皆有歎，以發修進故，有不歎者應是略也。	後勸令發心已，方乃歎之，中間知識皆有歎，以發修進故，有不歎者應是略也。	018	after encouraging him to give rise to the mind, he then praised him. The knowledge-beings in between all have praise, because it promotes the cultivation and progress, those without praise should be an omission.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c01_13']	後文殊普賢不歎，以位成滿故。	後文殊普賢不歎，以位成滿故。	018	Later, Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra do not praise, because their stage is already complete.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c02_17']	七推不推中二，謂諸位知識皆有結自分仰推勝進。	七推不推中二，謂諸位知識皆有結自分仰推勝進。	018	In the seven [passages] of promotion and non-promotion, this means that the knowledge-beings in all stages have a conclusion to their own section and a promotion to the superior progress.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c04_1']	唯初一，後三無結無推，為顯人尊德滿故爾。	唯初一，後三無結無推，為顯人尊德滿故爾。	018	Only the first one and the last three do not have a conclusion or promotion, because it is to show that the person is most venerable and his virtue is complete.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c04_6']	何以有遣？	何以有遣？	018	Why is there dismissal?
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c05_1']	謂表令位增故，顯法門別故。	謂表令位增故，顯法門別故。	018	This means to show that the stage increases and to show the difference in the Dharma gate.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c05_15']	餘位有結有推，以因行未圓故。	餘位有結有推，以因行未圓故。	018	The other stages have a conclusion and promotion, because the causal practices are not yet complete.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c06_7']	若爾，普賢等何以不推佛？	若爾，普賢等何以不推佛？	018	If that is so, why do Samantabhadra and the others not promote the Buddha?
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c06_16']	以非因位善友攝故。	以非因位善友攝故。	018	Because they are not the good friends who include the causal stage.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c08_2']	八結不結中，前諸文皆無結通，以行未究竟故；	八結不結中，前諸文皆無結通，以行未究竟故；	018	Among the eight knots and non-knots, the previous texts all lack the conclusion, because the practice is not yet ultimate.
['ZH_T35_1733_018:0453c09_12']	唯後普賢有結通十方等於塵剎，以普遍故、行滿故、事究竟故。	唯後普賢有結通十方等於塵剎，以普遍故、行滿故、事究竟故。	018	Only the final Samantabhadra has the conclusion of the ten directions, etc., in the dust lands, because it is universal, the practice is complete, and the matter is ultimate.

Therefore, Sudhana sets the wonderful example of seeking the Dharma, and the good friends manifest the good rules of expounding the Dharma, causing sentient beings to follow this path and cultivate practices, which is to always make the Buddha's flowers bloom and the vast adornments always be present.

They should only humble themselves, bow down, and focus on obtaining the Dharma.
