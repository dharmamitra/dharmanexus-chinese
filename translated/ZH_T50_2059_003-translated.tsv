The Tripiṭaka Dharma gate, if one has the conditions, will surely be seen. Since the Buddha's teachings were moved east, this was the most prosperous time.

The various masters also produced the Four Āgamas, the five parts, the Khandhakas, and the Vibhāṣā, etc. They all accord with the original Dharma and satisfy the three seals.

This is probably because karma has a transmission of karmic retribution, and righteousness cannot be avoided. Therefore, although arhats have already exhausted all defilements, they still suffer the misfortune of being pierced in the head. Although Bi Gan was loyal and sincere, he still encountered the misfortune of being given a sword. Is this not so?

He used a copper bowl for eating, which was not permitted by the Vinaya rules. He faced the ground when confessing, which was not a method of repentance.

Later, he met Dharmayaśas, who was not a teacher who specialized in the Hinayana teachings. He simply wanted to make his body different, so he made up deviant practices.

Hearing about cause and effect, they are leisurely and stubbornly opposed. Seeing magical transformations, they rush and drink like a torrent. The meaning of following and falling is precisely this.

This will only result in vain transcriptions, forever hidden in boxes, and the true teachings of the sweet dew will never be unraveled. The supreme precious pearl will be hidden and unused. Isn't this a pity?
