Emptiness is neither existence nor non-existence, but it is not named as neither existence nor non-existence. This is because it is a brief explanation, so it is called the chapter on emptiness.

The sharp ones have already understood, but for the sake of the dull-witted, with a mind of great compassion, it is further clarified that the five aggregates are originally empty and tranquil.
