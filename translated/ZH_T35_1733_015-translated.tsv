['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a15_11']	謂答前十自在問也，以別譯《菩薩本業經》彼經問中名為十明故。	謂答前十自在問也，以別譯《菩薩本業經》彼經問中名為十明故。	It refers to answering the ten questions about mastery, because the separately translated Bodhisattvas' Past Activities Sūtra calls them the ten illuminations in the questions.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a17_4']	三宗趣者，即此十明是理量二智，明用自在無礙為宗。	三宗趣者，即此十明是理量二智，明用自在無礙為宗。	Third, the purport and objective: these ten illuminations are the two kinds of wisdom of principle and phenomena, and the objective is the mastery and unobstructed use of the illuminations.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a17_12']	十明義略作三門：	十明義略作三門：	The meaning of the ten illuminations is roughly made into three sections:
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a19_20']	一顯名者，一他心、二天眼、三宿命、四未來際、五天耳、六無畏神力、七音聲、八色身、九真實、十滅定。	一顯名者，一他心、二天眼、三宿命、四未來際、五天耳、六無畏神力、七音聲、八色身、九真實、十滅定。	First, the explanation of the names: the first is other minds, the second is the heavenly eye, the third is past lives, the fourth is the future limit, the fifth is the heavenly ear, the sixth is fearless spiritual powers, the seventh is sound, the eighth is the form body, the ninth is reality, and the tenth is the concentration of cessation.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a22_5']	於中滅定相應受，稱天眼、天耳，從趣及根為名，餘從境為目，此十皆是智之業用，故同名智用也。	於中滅定相應受，稱天眼、天耳，從趣及根為名，餘從境為目，此十皆是智之業用，故同名智用也。	Among them, the feeling associated with the concentration of cessation is called the heavenly eye and heavenly ear, which are named after the realm and faculties, while the others are named after their objects. These ten are all the functions of wisdom, so they are all called the functions of wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a23_6']	二體性同以大智為性，然通普賢性起之智。	二體性同以大智為性，然通普賢性起之智。	Second, the essence is the same in taking great wisdom as its essence, but it generally includes the wisdom of the nature of universal virtue.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a25_14']	若隨相分之，前八是量智、後二是理智，據實唯一無礙智，以後二明亦不礙起用故，前八亦不廢即寂故。	若隨相分之，前八是量智、後二是理智，據實唯一無礙智，以後二明亦不礙起用故，前八亦不廢即寂故。	If we follow the distinctions of their aspects, the first eight are the knowledge of the realm of objects, and the last two are the knowledge of the realm of reality. But in reality they are one unobstructed knowledge, because the last two, although they are knowledge of the realm of reality, do not obstruct the arising of function, and the first eight, although they are knowledge of the realm of objects, do not obstruct the state of quiescence.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380a26_5']	三諸門分別中有十：	三諸門分別中有十：	Third, there are ten topics in the detailed analysis.

['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b01_2']	唯彼第四出生不可思議淨妙音聲，無量世界無不普聞方便智明，此一約用同此，餘竝別事。	唯彼第四出生不可思議淨妙音聲，無量世界無不普聞方便智明，此一約用同此，餘竝別事。	Only the fourth knowledge, the knowledge of the inconceivable pure and wonderful sounds that are heard everywhere in innumerable worlds, is the same as the knowledge of skillful means in this chapter. The other knowledges are different.

['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b05_4']	此中無畏神力攝第五出生不可思議自在神力示現眾生智通，及第七於一念中往詣不可說不可說世界智通。	此中無畏神力攝第五出生不可思議自在神力示現眾生智通，及第七於一念中往詣不可說不可說世界智通。	Herein, the fearlessness and spiritual power encompass the fifth, the inconceivable spiritual power of manifesting to sentient beings, and the seventh, the knowledge of going to inconceivable worlds in a single thought.

The eighth, the knowledge of adorning all worlds with inconceivable adornments, is also included here. That is about adorning the dependent origination, this is about adorning the direct cause.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b10_11']	此中未來際智明亦攝彼天眼，以彼所見故。	此中未來際智明亦攝彼天眼，以彼所見故。	Herein, the knowledge of the end of the future also encompasses the divine eye, because that is what is seen.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b11_3']	此中音聲明亦攝天耳。	此中音聲明亦攝天耳。	Herein, the knowledge of sound also encompasses the divine ear.

['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b14_18']	一非三所攝，以彼亦為二乘所得，此不爾故。	一非三所攝，以彼亦為二乘所得，此不爾故。	First, they are not included in the three, because those are also attained by the two vehicles, but this is not so.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b17_2']	二縱佛菩薩所得三明，於此十中但三攝五，亦非盡故，謂天眼攝二，謂天眼及未來際明；	二縱佛菩薩所得三明，於此十中但三攝五，亦非盡故，謂天眼攝二，謂天眼及未來際明；	Second, even if the three knowledges attained by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are included in these ten, only three include five, and that is not exhaustive either. That is to say, the heavenly eye includes two, namely the heavenly eye and the knowledge of the future end of suffering;
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b17_8']	宿命唯一也；	宿命唯一也；	The knowledge of past lives is only one;
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b17_19']	漏盡攝二，謂末後二也。	漏盡攝二，謂末後二也。	The knowledge of the destruction of contaminations includes two, namely the last two.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b18_10']	依《涅槃經》亦有三明：	依《涅槃經》亦有三明：	Based on the Nirvana Sutra, there are also three knowledges:

['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b19_11']	二菩薩明，謂般若波羅蜜；	二菩薩明，謂般若波羅蜜；	Second, the knowledge of Bodhisattvas, which is prajnaparamita;
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b20_1']	三無明明，謂畢竟空。	三無明明，謂畢竟空。	Third, the knowledge of non-knowledge, which is ultimate emptiness.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b20_7']	與此不同也。	與此不同也。	This is different from the above.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b20_19']	四約六通相攝者，亦二義：	四約六通相攝者，亦二義：	Fourth, in terms of the correspondence between the six spiritual powers and the three knowledges, there are also two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b21_14']	一非六所攝，以彼亦為二乘得故；	一非六所攝，以彼亦為二乘得故；	First, they are not included in the six, because those are also attained by the two vehicles;
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b23_13']	二若佛所得，攝非不盡，謂於六中天眼、天耳、神足、漏盡，此四各分二，故為十也。	二若佛所得，攝非不盡，謂於六中天眼、天耳、神足、漏盡，此四各分二，故為十也。	Second, if the Buddha's attainments are included, they are not incomplete, namely, among the six, the divine eye, divine ear, spiritual powers, and the destruction of contaminants, these four each have two parts, thus making ten.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b25_2']	即天眼約見現未分二，以未來生死智明亦是天眼所見故；	即天眼約見現未分二，以未來生死智明亦是天眼所見故；	That is, the divine eye is divided into two according to seeing the present and future, because the knowledge of future births and deaths is also seen by the divine eye;
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b26_2']	天耳約聽聞聖教及分別音聲，故分為二。	天耳約聽聞聖教及分別音聲，故分為二。	The divine ear is divided into two according to listening to the holy teachings and discerning sounds.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b26_14']	神足，約業用及色身為二。	神足，約業用及色身為二。	Spiritual powers are divided into two according to karmic function and physical form.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b27_3']	漏盡，約定慧為二。	漏盡，約定慧為二。	The destruction of contaminants is divided into two according to concentration and wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380b28_1']	第九是慧也，餘二不分，故六攝十也。	第九是慧也，餘二不分，故六攝十也。	The ninth is wisdom, the other two are not divided, thus the six include the ten.

['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380c02_17']	復次直知死此生彼是名通，知行業因緣際會不失是名明。	復次直知死此生彼是名通，知行業因緣際會不失是名明。	Furthermore, directly knowing death here and rebirth there is called spiritual power, knowing the causes and conditions of karmic actions and their inevitable consequences is called wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380c04_14']	復次直知盡結使不知更生不生是名漏盡通，若知漏盡更不復生是名明。	復次直知盡結使不知更生不生是名漏盡通，若知漏盡更不復生是名明。	Furthermore, directly knowing the exhaustion of afflictions but not knowing whether one will be reborn or not be reborn is called the spiritual power of the exhaustion of outflows, if one knows the exhaustion of outflows and will never be reborn again, this is called wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380c06_1']	」六約教顯異者，若小乘三乘，竝三明六通，但分齊差別。	」六約教顯異者，若小乘三乘，竝三明六通，但分齊差別。	Sixth, in terms of revealing differences through the teachings, if it is the Lesser Vehicle or the Three Vehicles, they all have the three insights and six spiritual powers, but there are differences in their scope.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380c06_17']	若一乘，十明十通與前亦寬狹為異。	若一乘，十明十通與前亦寬狹為異。	If it is the One Vehicle, the ten insights and ten spiritual powers are also different from the previous in terms of their breadth and narrowness.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380c08_6']	七約所知分齊者，《智論》第三云「此三明，二乘亦得，但有不滿。	七約所知分齊者，《智論》第三云「此三明，二乘亦得，但有不滿。	Seventh, in terms of the scope of what is known, the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says, These three insights are also attained by the Two Vehicles, but they are not complete.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0380c09_6']	謂於過去或知一世，極至八萬，後不能知；	謂於過去或知一世，極至八萬，後不能知；	That is to say, regarding the past, they may know one lifetime, at most 80,000 eons, but cannot know beyond that;

The lower section of the chapter on Leaving the World uses an analogy to illustrate the aggregate of consciousness. The Sutra of the Adornment of the Contemplation of the Buddha uses an analogy to illustrate the eighth consciousness. The Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom uses an analogy to illustrate the external world. This sutra uses an analogy to illustrate the world, the world beyond the world, the pure and defiled realms, etc. The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra uses an analogy to illustrate all dharmas. The Treatise on the Precious Palm directly uses an analogy to illustrate conditioned dharmas.

This is explained from the perspective of the distinctions in capacities of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1733_015:0392b07_4']	二無礙門，謂報化不分，即權恒實，如樹王下現十佛身、丈六遍於十方、八相該於法界、諸根毛孔各無限量亦不礙限量，是則限無限無礙，此約一乘圓機說。	二無礙門，謂報化不分，即權恒實，如樹王下現十佛身、丈六遍於十方、八相該於法界、諸根毛孔各無限量亦不礙限量，是則限無限無礙，此約一乘圓機說。	The second is the aspect of non-obstruction, referring to the non-differentiation of the reward and transformation bodies, such that the provisional is always the real. For example, the ten buddha bodies manifested under the tree of enlightenment, the sixteen-foot body pervading the ten directions, the eight aspects of the Buddha's life encompassing the Dharma realm, each of the faculties and pores having infinite dimensions without obstructing finite dimensions. In this case, the finite and infinite are unobstructed. This is explained from the perspective of the perfect capacities of the one vehicle.

['ZH_T35_1733_015:0392b29_11']	今謂此品總顯佛德體用殊勝，次〈相海品〉別顯勝德之相，後〈小相品〉別辨勝德益用。	今謂此品總顯佛德體用殊勝，次〈相海品〉別顯勝德之相，後〈小相品〉別辨勝德益用。	Now, this chapter generally reveals the superior essence and function of the Buddha's merits, the next chapter on the ocean of characteristics specifically reveals the characteristics of superior merits, and the last chapter on the minor characteristics specifically distinguishes the superior merits and beneficial functions.
