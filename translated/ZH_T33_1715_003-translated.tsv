['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597a24_0']	「爾時世尊而說偈言」，因歎二智髣髴開宗中	「爾時世尊而說偈言」，因歎二智髣髴開宗中	At that time the World-Honored One spoke a verse, praising the two wisdoms and vaguely opening the doctrine.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597a27_7']	有二，長行與偈頌，此下是第二正明偈頌，但且長行中本二，一者寄言以歎二智、二者明寄絕言歎二智。	有二，長行與偈頌，此下是第二正明偈頌，但且長行中本二，一者寄言以歎二智、二者明寄絕言歎二智。	There are two parts: prose and verse. From here on is the second part, which clarifies the verses. But in the prose there are originally two parts: first, using words to praise the two wisdoms; second, clarifying the use of inexpressible words to praise the two wisdoms.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597a28_1']	今者十七行半偈亦分為二：	今者十七行半偈亦分為二：	Now, the seventeen and a half line verse is also divided into two parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b01_3']	第一有四行偈正頌上寄言歎二智，第二從「如是大果報」下有十三行半偈頌寄絕言歎二智。	第一有四行偈正頌上寄言歎二智，第二從「如是大果報」下有十三行半偈頌寄絕言歎二智。	The first has four lines of verse that正頌 the above use of words to praise the two wisdoms; the second, from Such great fruits and rewards, has thirteen and a half lines of verse that 頌 the use of inexpressible words to praise the two wisdoms.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b02_17']	但上長行寄言歎二智中本有二，一者將欲歎釋迦二智，故先歎諸佛二智；	但上長行寄言歎二智中本有二，一者將欲歎釋迦二智，故先歎諸佛二智；	But in the prose, the use of words to praise the two wisdoms originally had two parts: first, in order to praise the two wisdoms of Shakyamuni, it first praises the two wisdoms of all Buddhas;
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b03_7']	二者正歎釋迦二智。	二者正歎釋迦二智。	Second, it 正 praises the two wisdoms of Shakyamuni.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b03_16']	此兩雙中各有三重：	此兩雙中各有三重：	In these two pairs, each has three layers:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b04_13']	第一正歎二智、第二釋、第三結也。	第一正歎二智、第二釋、第三結也。	The first is the correct praise of the two knowledges, the second is the explanation, and the third is the conclusion.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b05_7']	今者四行偈頌之為體亦分為二：	今者四行偈頌之為體亦分為二：	Now, the four-line verse as the body is also divided into two parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b07_9']	初兩行偈併疊頌諸佛釋迦正歎二智，後兩行復併疊頌諸佛釋迦釋二智，結二智兩重也。	初兩行偈併疊頌諸佛釋迦正歎二智，後兩行復併疊頌諸佛釋迦釋二智，結二智兩重也。	The first two lines of verse collectively praise the two knowledges of the buddhas and Śākyamuni, while the last two lines collectively explain the two knowledges of the buddhas and Śākyamuni, concluding the two knowledges in two layers.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b09_4']	又就兩偈疊頌諸佛釋迦正歎二智中，前偈頌諸佛二智，後偈頌釋迦二智也。	又就兩偈疊頌諸佛釋迦正歎二智中，前偈頌諸佛二智，後偈頌釋迦二智也。	Moreover, in the two verses collectively praising the two knowledges of the buddhas and Śākyamuni, the former verse praises the two knowledges of the buddhas, while the latter verse praises the two knowledges of Śākyamuni.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b10_13']	但上歎諸佛二智中，先歎實智後歎權智，然先嘆實智中有二句：	但上歎諸佛二智中，先歎實智後歎權智，然先嘆實智中有二句：	However, in the praise of the two knowledges of the buddhas above, the real knowledge is praised first, followed by the expedient knowledge. There are two sentences in the praise of the real knowledge first:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b11_20']	初舉智體言「諸佛智慧」，第二句正歎言「甚深無量」。	初舉智體言「諸佛智慧」，第二句正歎言「甚深無量」。	The first sentence brings up the essence of knowledge, saying the wisdom of the buddhas, and the second sentence is the correct praise, saying extremely profound and immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b12_4']	後歎權智有三：	後歎權智有三：	The praise of expedient knowledge has three parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b14_7']	先舉智體言其智慧門，第二正歎言難解難入，第三出不知眾，言一切聲聞辟支佛所不能知也。	先舉智體言其智慧門，第二正歎言難解難入，第三出不知眾，言一切聲聞辟支佛所不能知也。	First, it raises the essence of wisdom and speaks of the gate of wisdom. The second praises it as difficult to understand and difficult to enter. The third reveals the assembly that does not know, saying that all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot know it.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b16_16']	今者「世雄不可量」一句，即得併頌實智權智各二句，「諸佛智慧甚深無量」、「其智慧門難解難入」等也。	今者「世雄不可量」一句，即得併頌實智權智各二句，「諸佛智慧甚深無量」、「其智慧門難解難入」等也。	Now, the single phrase the hero of the world, immeasurable can be used to praise both the actual wisdom and expedient wisdom, such as the wisdom of the buddhas is profound and immeasurable and the gate of wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b18_13']	諸佛應同十方此則世義，降四魔伏外道是雄義，權實二智非下人所測故言不可量也。	諸佛應同十方此則世義，降四魔伏外道是雄義，權實二智非下人所測故言不可量也。	The buddhas should be the same in the ten directions. This is the meaning of the world. Subduing the four demons and subduing the non-Buddhists is the meaning of the hero. The two wisdoms of expedient and actual cannot be measured by those of lower capacities, so it says immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b21_6']	「諸天及世人一切眾生類無能知佛者」下三句頌上權智，下第三句出不知眾，上言一切聲聞辟支佛所不能知也。	「諸天及世人一切眾生類無能知佛者」下三句頌上權智，下第三句出不知眾，上言一切聲聞辟支佛所不能知也。	Among the devas and worldly people, among all kinds of beings, there is none who can know the Buddha. The three phrases below praise the expedient wisdom. The third phrase below reveals the assembly that does not know. Above it says that all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot know it.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b22_5']	且今用此一偈頌前長行凡有四種不同：	且今用此一偈頌前長行凡有四種不同：	For now, this single verse is used to praise the previous prose section, which has four kinds of differences:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b23_14']	上長行中別歎實智與方便智，今此偈中合頌權實二智，一不同；	上長行中別歎實智與方便智，今此偈中合頌權實二智，一不同；	In the prose above, the real wisdom and expedient wisdom were praised separately, but in this verse, the expedient and real wisdoms are praised together, which is the first difference.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b24_18']	上當體歎權實二智，今此偈中舉人歎二智，二不同；	上當體歎權實二智，今此偈中舉人歎二智，二不同；	In the prose above, the expedient and real wisdoms were praised in terms of their essence, but in this verse, the two wisdoms are praised by referring to the person, which is the second difference.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b26_10']	上明不知人唯繫在權智下，今此偈中頌出不知人雙繫二智下，三不同；	上明不知人唯繫在權智下，今此偈中頌出不知人雙繫二智下，三不同；	In the prose above, the person who does not know is only connected to the expedient wisdom below, but in this verse, the person who does not know is praised by referring to both wisdoms, which is the third difference.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b29_3']	上長行中出不知人唯出聲聞、緣覺二人，今此偈中廣出人、天、聲聞、緣覺，遠及菩薩，併出五乘人都是不知眾，四不同。	上長行中出不知人唯出聲聞、緣覺二人，今此偈中廣出人、天、聲聞、緣覺，遠及菩薩，併出五乘人都是不知眾，四不同。	In the prose above, only the two people of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are mentioned as the people who do not know, but in this verse, the people of humans, gods, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and even bodhisattvas are mentioned, and all the people of the five vehicles are mentioned as the assembly who do not know, which is the fourth difference.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b29_10']	何如此不同耶？	何如此不同耶？	Why are there these differences?
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597b29_15']	解釋者言：	解釋者言：	The expounders say:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c01_6']	「此義亦微，有所以有。	「此義亦微，有所以有。	This meaning is also subtle, and there are reasons for it.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c06_1']	上長行中所以二智別歎者，則明義用異，但此二智只是聖人神解涉用為義，從機曲說未若權智，但此權智應有所出，是故先別歎實智是權家之本，後歎權智是智，是本家之末，是故權實互歎，此明用有勝負。	上長行中所以二智別歎者，則明義用異，但此二智只是聖人神解涉用為義，從機曲說未若權智，但此權智應有所出，是故先別歎實智是權家之本，後歎權智是智，是本家之末，是故權實互歎，此明用有勝負。	The reason for separately praising the two knowledges in the above prose section is to clarify that their meanings and functions are different. However, these two knowledges are simply the sagely person's spiritual understanding and functioning. Speaking according to the capacities is not as good as expedient knowledge. However, this expedient knowledge should have a source. Therefore, it first separately praises true knowledge, which is the basis of expedient knowledge. Later it praises expedient knowledge, which is the end of the knowledge that is the basis. Therefore, expedient and true are mutually praised. This clarifies that the functioning has victory and defeat.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c07_9']	偈中合頌者，此明二智雖有權實二名，照然則體一更無異也。	偈中合頌者，此明二智雖有權實二名，照然則體一更無異也。	The verse combines the praise. This clarifies that although the two knowledges have the two names of expedient and true, when illuminated, their essence is one and no different.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c07_18']	是故《維摩經》言：	是故《維摩經》言：	Therefore, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c08_16']	十方世界有若干也，其無礙慧無若干也。	十方世界有若干也，其無礙慧無若干也。	The worlds in the ten directions are various, but unobstructed wisdom is not various.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c10_18']	復言上當體歎二智者，明此經本意故，故當體歎偈中明二智所成人，故舉人總歎二智也。	復言上當體歎二智者，明此經本意故，故當體歎偈中明二智所成人，故舉人總歎二智也。	It is further said that above it praises the two knowledges in terms of their essence, clarifying that this is the fundamental meaning of the sūtra, and therefore it praises them in terms of their essence. In the verse it clarifies the person perfected by the two knowledges, and therefore it raises the person to comprehensively praise the two knowledges.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c14_9', 'ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c16_12']	復言上出不知人唯繫權智下，今此偈中雙繫二智下者，上宜鄙斥二人智慧狹劣，雖稟昔日權智之教不能究了，為是義故，上出不知人偏繫權智下。🔽而今偈中雙繫二智下者，明此二乘非直不解權智之用、實智冥然莫測，是故雙繫二智下。	復言上出不知人唯繫權智下，今此偈中雙繫二智下者，上宜鄙斥二人智慧狹劣，雖稟昔日權智之教不能究了，為是義故，上出不知人偏繫權智下。 而今偈中雙繫二智下者，明此二乘非直不解權智之用、實智冥然莫測，是故雙繫二智下。	Furthermore, it is said that in the previous verse only the wisdom of skillful means was mentioned, while in this verse both wisdoms are mentioned. The previous verse disparaged the wisdom of the two vehicles as narrow and inferior, saying that although they received the teachings of skillful means in the past, they were unable to fully understand them. For this reason, only the wisdom of skillful means was mentioned in the previous verse.🔽However, in this verse, both wisdoms are mentioned, clarifying that the two vehicles not only do not understand the function of skillful means, but also the wisdom of reality is completely beyond their comprehension. Therefore, both wisdoms are mentioned in this verse.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c21_9']	復言上長行唯出二乘至偈頌中言一切眾生類無能知佛者，廣出五乘人者，此為釋物疑情，但今日之教本為斥二乘封執之情，是故長行偏對二乘，但于時時眾謂言二智止是二乘不解，自二乘之外應有解者。	復言上長行唯出二乘至偈頌中言一切眾生類無能知佛者，廣出五乘人者，此為釋物疑情，但今日之教本為斥二乘封執之情，是故長行偏對二乘，但于時時眾謂言二智止是二乘不解，自二乘之外應有解者。	Furthermore, it is said that in the prose only the two vehicles were mentioned, while in the verse it is said that no sentient being is able to know the Buddha, and that the five vehicles of beings are broadly mentioned. This is to resolve people's doubts. The teachings of today are originally meant to refute the two vehicles' attachment to their own teachings. Therefore, the prose only addresses the two vehicles. But at that time, the assembly thought that the two wisdoms were only not understood by the two vehicles, and that there should be those who understand outside of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c22_18']	是故偈中言非唯二乘不解此權實之理，人天及菩薩亦復不解。	是故偈中言非唯二乘不解此權實之理，人天及菩薩亦復不解。	Therefore, the verse says that not only the two vehicles do not understand this principle of skillful means and reality, but also humans, gods, and bodhisattvas do not understand it.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c23_8']	如此頌類舉可知也。	如此頌類舉可知也。	Such verses can be cited to illustrate this point.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c24_9']	」「佛力無所畏」，此一偈正頌正歎釋迦二智。	」「佛力無所畏」，此一偈正頌正歎釋迦二智。	The Buddha's powers and fearlessnesses, this one verse directly praises Śākyamuni's two wisdoms.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c26_14']	上正歎釋迦二智中，先歎權智後歎實智，今此一行偈上半行先頌歎釋迦實智，下半行追頌權智。	上正歎釋迦二智中，先歎權智後歎實智，今此一行偈上半行先頌歎釋迦實智，下半行追頌權智。	In the original praise of Śākyamuni's two wisdoms, first praising skillful wisdom and then praising true wisdom, now this one line of verse first praises Śākyamuni's true wisdom in the upper half, and the lower half continues to praise skillful wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0597c29_1']	但上歎釋迦實智中，先正歎實智，後即舉力、無畏等，今此半偈正得略頌上諸功德句，不頌正歎句也。	但上歎釋迦實智中，先正歎實智，後即舉力、無畏等，今此半偈正得略頌上諸功德句，不頌正歎句也。	But in the original praise of Śākyamuni's true wisdom, first directly praising true wisdom, and then immediately citing powers, fearlessnesses, etc., now this half verse only briefly praises the phrase of various merits above, and does not praise the phrase of direct praise.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a01_7']	「及佛諸餘法無能測量者」，此半行倒頌上歎釋迦權智句。	「及佛諸餘法無能測量者」，此半行倒頌上歎釋迦權智句。	And the Buddha's other dharmas, none can fathom them, this half verse inverts the praise of Śākyamuni's skillful wisdom above.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a03_16']	上歎釋迦權智中正歎有三重，初「吾從成佛以來」明權智時節，「以種種因緣」下正歎，「引導眾生」下顯也。	上歎釋迦權智中正歎有三重，初「吾從成佛以來」明權智時節，「以種種因緣」下正歎，「引導眾生」下顯也。	The above praise of Śākyamuni's expedient wisdom has three layers of praise. The first, Since I attained Buddhahood, clarifies the time of expedient wisdom. The line below using various causes and conditions is the actual praise. The line below guiding sentient beings reveals it.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a04_16']	今此半偈只頌第二正歎句，不頌第一第二句也。	今此半偈只頌第二正歎句，不頌第一第二句也。	Now this half verse only praises the second line of the actual praise, not the first and second lines.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a05_20']	今者所以言「及佛諸餘法」者，權智在後故言餘也。	今者所以言「及佛諸餘法」者，權智在後故言餘也。	The reason it says and the Buddha's other teachings now is because expedient wisdom comes later, so it is called other.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a06_16']	此權智為三根人說之不一，故稱諸也。	此權智為三根人說之不一，故稱諸也。	This expedient wisdom is taught for people of the three capacities, so it is called various.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a07_11']	又用此一偈復頌長行有三不同。	又用此一偈復頌長行有三不同。	Moreover, this one verse again praises the three differences in the prose section.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a07_14']	何者？	何者？	What are they?
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a09_8']	長行中先歎釋迦權智後歎實智，今此偈中先頌實智後頌權智，一不同。	長行中先歎釋迦權智後歎實智，今此偈中先頌實智後頌權智，一不同。	In the prose section, it first praises Śākyamuni's expedient wisdom and then praises his true wisdom. In this verse, it first praises true wisdom and then praises expedient wisdom, the first difference.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a12_7']	上長行中言「如來知見廣大深遠」正歎實智，後舉諸功德同釋歎也，今偈中唯頌舉諸功德釋歎實智句，略不頌正歎實智句，二不同。	上長行中言「如來知見廣大深遠」正歎實智，後舉諸功德同釋歎也，今偈中唯頌舉諸功德釋歎實智句，略不頌正歎實智句，二不同。	In the prose above, The Tathagata's knowledge and vision is vast and profound praises his true wisdom, and later it cites various merits to explain the praise. Now in the verse, it only praises the explanation of the true wisdom with various merits, and does not praise the true wisdom itself, which is the second difference.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a13_19']	上長行中歎釋迦二智不出不知眾，今偈中言「無能測量者」，三不同。	上長行中歎釋迦二智不出不知眾，今偈中言「無能測量者」，三不同。	In the prose above, the praise and explanation of Shakyamuni's two wisdoms do not go beyond the assembly that cannot know, but now in the verse it says no one can fathom it, which is the third difference.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a14_3']	解釋者言：	解釋者言：	The interpreter says:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a17_13']	「上長行所以先歎權智後歎實智者，此明釋迦出世之意先權後實，偈中所以先頌實智後頌權智者，此明今日實用時，此皆前後互舉，迭相映發其義自彰。	「上長行所以先歎權智後歎實智者，此明釋迦出世之意先權後實，偈中所以先頌實智後頌權智者，此明今日實用時，此皆前後互舉，迭相映發其義自彰。	The reason why the prose first praises expedient wisdom and then praises true wisdom is to clarify that Shakyamuni's intention in appearing in the world is first expedient and then true. The reason why the verse first praises true wisdom and then praises expedient wisdom is to clarify that today is the time for the true use. These are all mutual references in sequence, and the meaning is revealed by their mutual illumination.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a19_7']	復言長行中有正歎實智有釋，偈中唯頌釋句者，此明有體一用異之義。	復言長行中有正歎實智有釋，偈中唯頌釋句者，此明有體一用異之義。	Furthermore, the reason why the prose has both praise and explanation of true wisdom, while the verse only praises the explanation, is to clarify the meaning of having one essence but different functions.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a19_17']	上長行語其用異之義。	上長行語其用異之義。	The prose section above discusses the meaning of their different functions.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a20_4']	何以知之？	何以知之？	How can this be known?
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a20_11']	智慧鑒照為義。	智慧鑒照為義。	The meaning of wisdom is to illuminate and perceive.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a22_10']	欲明實智所照之境有四一之義，有教一、理一、機一、人一，如來智照此四境，故稱實智。	欲明實智所照之境有四一之義，有教一、理一、機一、人一，如來智照此四境，故稱實智。	It clarifies that the realm perceived by true wisdom has the meaning of four ones: teaching one, principle one, capacity one, and person one. The Tathāgata's wisdom illuminates these four realms, thus it is called true wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a23_11']	力、無畏等諸功德不詺鑒照，故知長行據其用。	力、無畏等諸功德不詺鑒照，故知長行據其用。	The various merits such as powers and fearlessnesses are not called illumination and perception, therefore it is known that the prose section is based on their functions.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a26_4']	偈中唯頌諸功德者，此明功德與智慧只是一體，離此力、無畏、解脫三昧等更無別有智慧，亦離此智慧無別有功德。	偈中唯頌諸功德者，此明功德與智慧只是一體，離此力、無畏、解脫三昧等更無別有智慧，亦離此智慧無別有功德。	The verses only praise the various merits, which clarifies that merits and wisdom are just one essence. Apart from these powers, fearlessnesses, liberations, samādhis, etc., there is no separate wisdom. Wisdom is also apart from these merits.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a27_1']	故知體一，據用則有功德智慧之異；	故知體一，據用則有功德智慧之異；	Therefore it is known that the essence is one. Based on their functions, there is a difference between merits and wisdom;
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a27_15']	置用談體，智慧功德只是一體。	置用談體，智慧功德只是一體。	Setting aside the functions and discussing the essence, merits and wisdom are just one essence.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0598a28_7']	此皆前後互舉、兩義雙明。	此皆前後互舉、兩義雙明。	These are all mutual references in sequence, with both meanings clearly explained.

The conditioned fruit refers to the knowledge of exhaustion and the knowledge of non-arising.

The śrāvaka's complete elimination of the manifest afflictions of the three realms is likened to the sheep cart, the pratyekabuddha's slight encroachment on the habitual tendencies is likened to the deer cart, and the bodhisattva's complete elimination of the habitual tendencies is likened to the ox cart.

Therefore, it is said, The path you are practicing is the bodhisattva path.🔽Among these four ones, in the two knowledges, the true knowledge illuminates the realm. The four ones have both the same and different meanings. The realm illuminated by the true knowledge has the same conditions. Here there is no same conditions. The reason there are four is that within the same principle, it is divided into two kinds, namely, the same cause and the same fruit.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0603a29_1']	然因果皆是理，所以彼處明機一，今此中不明機一者，前明機一、此明二智所照境故明也。	然因果皆是理，所以彼處明機一，今此中不明機一者，前明機一、此明二智所照境故明也。	However, both cause and effect are principles. The reason it clarifies the same conditions there, but does not clarify the same conditions here, is because it clarifies the two knowledges that illuminate the realm.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0603b04_8']	此中明會三歸一，若遠相緣由亦應會三機為一機，但此三機實是眾生自有法，故不可會三歸一，自餘三一是諸佛昔日應三機，但以假名字分一為三，今日一乘機熟，故可得合三還歸於一也。	此中明會三歸一，若遠相緣由亦應會三機為一機，但此三機實是眾生自有法，故不可會三歸一，自餘三一是諸佛昔日應三機，但以假名字分一為三，今日一乘機熟，故可得合三還歸於一也。	Here it clarifies the merging of the three returns into one. If the distant characteristics are related, it should also merge the three capacities into one capacity. But these three capacities actually exist in sentient beings themselves, so they cannot be merged into one return. The remaining three ones are the three capacities that the buddhas of the past responded to. They only provisionally divided one into three using false names. Today, the capacity for the one vehicle has matured, so the three can be combined and returned to one.

Here, when it says one teaching, it means that because of the three capacities that were responded to in the past, there were three teachings. The three teachings are not one. The three teachings ultimately expound the one principle of today, so the three teachings of the past are ultimately formed into the one teaching of today.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0603b09_11']	此中明人一與實智所照境人不同。	此中明人一與實智所照境人不同。	Here, the one person is different from the person illuminated by true wisdom.

Today, the good opportunity of the One Vehicle of sentient beings has arisen. The person formed by a single opportunity is considered to be the same person. Therefore, all bodhisattvas are considered to be a single realm.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0603b15_17']	此中人一者，昔日三乘機一所成邊非是一，為三機善所成邊是一善理一，故會昔三人終成今日一菩薩人，但今日教一人一名字與實智所照教一人一名字同明義意異也；	此中人一者，昔日三乘機一所成邊非是一，為三機善所成邊是一善理一，故會昔三人終成今日一菩薩人，但今日教一人一名字與實智所照教一人一名字同明義意異也；	Here, the same person means that the aspect formed by the single opportunity of the three vehicles in the past is not the same. The aspect formed by the good opportunities of the three vehicles is the same good principle. Therefore, the three people of the past will eventually become a single bodhisattva today. However, the name of the single person today is the same as the name of the single person illuminated by true wisdom, but the meaning of the teaching is different.

Sentient beings have this future fruit from the beginning, but since the five turbidities have been strong and the obstructions heavy since ancient times, they are not yet able to hear the Mahayana and are not told of their future fruit. This future fruit then has the meaning of being closed.

Sentient beings hearing this statement give rise to the wisdom of hearing. This is the meaning of being shown.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0603c09_3']	且又三乘人相與思惟籌量，昔來是方便，今一因一果是真實，我等未來皆應得佛，深解此理，于時則生思慧詺為悟。	且又三乘人相與思惟籌量，昔來是方便，今一因一果是真實，我等未來皆應得佛，深解此理，于時則生思慧詺為悟。	Moreover, the people of the three vehicles together contemplate and calculate that this has been a skillful means in the past, and now the one cause and one fruit are the truth.

['ZH_T33_1715_003:0606c05_1']	且自昔日三乘教不說有無明住地之苦，就昔教既不說有此生死之苦，則於是苦無有厭心，故言貪著。	且自昔日三乘教不說有無明住地之苦，就昔教既不說有此生死之苦，則於是苦無有厭心，故言貪著。	Moreover, since the teachings of the three vehicles of old did not speak of the suffering of the stage of ignorance, and since the teachings of old did not speak of this suffering of birth and death, there is no mind of disgust towards this suffering, and therefore it is said to be attachment.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0606c07_5']	第二解言，故始須陀洹等，若論求道之邊此則遭苦厭老病死猶有妻子之愛，此則是貪著於生死。	第二解言，故始須陀洹等，若論求道之邊此則遭苦厭老病死猶有妻子之愛，此則是貪著於生死。	The second interpretation says that those who have just attained the stage of stream-entry, etc., in terms of seeking the Way, still have the love of wife and children while encountering suffering and being disgusted with old age, sickness, and death. This is attachment to birth and death.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0606c08_8']	此兩解隨意用之，後又言機中有厭情則有貪也。	此兩解隨意用之，後又言機中有厭情則有貪也。	These two interpretations can be used as one wishes. Later, it is said that if there is a mind of disgust among the capacities, then there is attachment.

First, it explains that the teachings of the Three Vehicles of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas are skillful means. It says that yesterday was the truth and today is the skillful means.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0606c14_15']	第二言「我此九部法」一偈倒開上人天二乘教亦是方便，故說是人天等經根本本為大故，言入大乘為本，以故說是經。	第二言「我此九部法」一偈倒開上人天二乘教亦是方便，故說是人天等經根本本為大故，言入大乘為本，以故說是經。	The second, I have these nine kinds of teachings, one verse explains that the teachings for humans and gods and the Two Vehicles are also skillful means. Therefore, the sutras for humans and gods, etc. are fundamentally for the sake of the Great. It says that entering the Great Vehicle is the basis, and therefore this sutra is taught.

Expounding the Mahayana teaching refers to the Mahayana of the three vehicles of the past, not the Mahayana of today. The second two lines of verse properly open this skillful means, which has two parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0606c21_14']	初「我記如是人」下一行半略記成佛，第二「佛知彼心行」下半行正開是方便，佛知彼心行為說三乘中之大乘也。	初「我記如是人」下一行半略記成佛，第二「佛知彼心行」下半行正開是方便，佛知彼心行為說三乘中之大乘也。	The first one and a half lines from I predict such a person briefly record the attainment of Buddhahood. The second half line from The Buddha knows their mental activities properly opens this skillful means, and the Buddha knows their mental activities in order to expound the Mahayana among the three vehicles.

['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a01_18']	第一從「說佛智慧故」下有一行三句偈，先明佛未應世時欲為眾生說一大乘果，不欲與小乘果；	第一從「說佛智慧故」下有一行三句偈，先明佛未應世時欲為眾生說一大乘果，不欲與小乘果；	The first, from Because it expounds the wisdom of the Buddha down, has one verse and three lines, first clarifying that before the Buddha appeared in the world, he wanted to expound the fruit of the One Great Vehicle for sentient beings, and did not want to give them the fruit of the Lesser Vehicle;
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a03_15']	第二從「如其所得法定慧力莊嚴」下有四行三句偈，正明出世以來欲與一乘果；	第二從「如其所得法定慧力莊嚴」下有四行三句偈，正明出世以來欲與一乘果；	The second, from The Dharma that he has attained, with the adornments of samādhi and prajñā down, has four verses and three lines, directly clarifying that since appearing in the world, he wants to give the fruit of the One Vehicle;
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a05_10']	第三從「舍利弗當知我本立誓願」有兩行，明如來本行菩薩道時欲與大乘果。	第三從「舍利弗當知我本立誓願」有兩行，明如來本行菩薩道時欲與大乘果。	The third, from Śāriputra, you should know that I have made a vow in the past has two lines, clarifying that when the Tathāgata was practicing the bodhisattva path, he wanted to give the fruit of the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a07_3']	又此三段前一後一不開，只就第二佛出世以來欲與大乘果有四重：	又此三段前一後一不開，只就第二佛出世以來欲與大乘果有四重：	Furthermore, the first and last sections are not opened up, only the second is divided into four layers since the Buddha's appearance in the world to the bestowal of the Mahāyāna fruit.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a08_7']	第一從「如其所得法」三句，正明佛將欲以大果與眾生。	第一從「如其所得法」三句，正明佛將欲以大果與眾生。	The first, from the Dharma that he has attained and three lines, clearly shows the Buddha about to bestow the great fruit on sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a11_8']	第二從「自證無上道」下一行半偈，釋佛出世之本意欲與大果，我若惜此大果，我是慳貪之人，無奈眾生無大果之機，是故先為說三。	第二從「自證無上道」下一行半偈，釋佛出世之本意欲與大果，我若惜此大果，我是慳貪之人，無奈眾生無大果之機，是故先為說三。	The second, from having realized the unsurpassed path and a line and a half of verse, explains the original intention of the Buddha's appearance in the world to bestow the great fruit. If I am stingy with this great fruit, I am a greedy person. I cannot help but first speak of the three for sentient beings who lack the capacity for the great fruit.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a12_15']	但時眾於中生疑，佛為自言欲與眾生大果，誰當信佛此語？	但時眾於中生疑，佛為自言欲與眾生大果，誰當信佛此語？	But the assembly at that time gave rise to doubts. The Buddha himself said he wants to bestow the great fruit on sentient beings, but who will believe the Buddha's words?
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a17_1']	故第三從「若人信歸佛」下有一行一偈引勝人證，汝言無有信者，自有人信三寶者，言佛不欺誑者，此等人信佛恒欲與眾生大果，時眾有生疑言，若使都無有信三寶者，誰當復信佛耶？	故第三從「若人信歸佛」下有一行一偈引勝人證，汝言無有信者，自有人信三寶者，言佛不欺誑者，此等人信佛恒欲與眾生大果，時眾有生疑言，若使都無有信三寶者，誰當復信佛耶？	Therefore, the third section, from If a person has faith and takes refuge in the Buddha, has one line and one verse, citing superior people as evidence. Your statement that there are no believers means that there are people who have faith in the Three Jewels and say that the Buddha is not deceptive. These people believe that the Buddha always wishes to bestow great fruits upon sentient beings. At that time, the assembly had doubts and said, If there are no believers in the Three Jewels at all, who would believe in the Buddha?
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a19_16']	第四「我以相嚴身」一偈，用佛自身功德相好，證佛與大果不虛，若是無威德人容可不實，佛既如此形相，云何當出言不實？	第四「我以相嚴身」一偈，用佛自身功德相好，證佛與大果不虛，若是無威德人容可不實，佛既如此形相，云何當出言不實？	The fourth section, I adorn my body with marks, is one verse using the Buddha's own merits and excellent characteristics to prove that the Buddha's bestowal of great fruits is not false. If it were a person without majestic virtue, it might not be true. Since the Buddha has such a form and appearance, how could his words be untrue?

['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a24_5']	第二六行偈出五濁體。	第二六行偈出五濁體。	The second six-line verse reveals the essence of the five turbidities.

['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607a27_14']	此三段之中前一後一不開，第二出五濁便成五重，「我知此眾生」兩行偈出眾生濁。	此三段之中前一後一不開，第二出五濁便成五重，「我知此眾生」兩行偈出眾生濁。	Within these three sections, the first and last are not opened. The second, revealing the five turbidities, becomes five layers. The two-line verse I know these sentient beings reveals the turbidity of sentient beings.

The one-line verse Entering the dense forest of wrong views reveals the turbidity of views. The sixty-two views take the view of self as the basis. Non-Buddhists consider the self to be the same as form, or separate from form, or the self residing in form, or form residing in the self, and so on up to the aggregate of mental activities.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607b02_17']	五陰上各有四五，便成二十見。	五陰上各有四五，便成二十見。	Each of the five aggregates has four or five [views], totaling twenty views.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607b06_1']	現在有二十見，此可見由因生故，故過去五陰上亦有二十見，復感未來種數，故未來世五陰復計二十見，合三世各二十見便成六十見。	現在有二十見，此可見由因生故，故過去五陰上亦有二十見，復感未來種數，故未來世五陰復計二十見，合三世各二十見便成六十見。	There are twenty views in the present, which can be seen to arise from causes, so the past five aggregates also have twenty views, which in turn give rise to future seeds, so the future five aggregates again have twenty views. Combining the twenty views of the three periods of time results in sixty views.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607b06_14']	見雖有六十，不出斷常二見。	見雖有六十，不出斷常二見。	Although there are sixty views, they do not go beyond the two views of annihilationism and eternalism.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607b06_19']	何故如此？	何故如此？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607b08_2']	若使計色即是我者，後時便成斷見，即是無見也。	若使計色即是我者，後時便成斷見，即是無見也。	If one considers form to be the self, later on it becomes the view of annihilationism, which is the view of non-existence.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607b09_3']	自餘三見皆離色計我便成常見，即是有見也。	自餘三見皆離色計我便成常見，即是有見也。	The remaining three views all consider the self to be separate from form, which becomes the view of eternalism, which is the view of existence.
['ZH_T33_1715_003:0607b10_17']	是知總而論之，是有無二見，別而談之有六十見，若總若別故有六十二見也。	是知總而論之，是有無二見，別而談之有六十見，若總若別故有六十二見也。	Thus, in general, there are the two views of existence and non-existence, and in detail there are sixty views. Whether in general or in detail, there are thus sixty-two views.
