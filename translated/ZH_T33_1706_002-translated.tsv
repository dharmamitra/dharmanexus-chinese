['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b07_9']	佛本無四，從所說教故有四佛當分之身。	佛本無四，從所說教故有四佛當分之身。	The Buddha originally has no four, but because of the teachings he expounds, there are four Buddhas with different bodies.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b08_17']	通而言之本唯一佛，以境本則三藏如來，於色相上四見不同。	通而言之本唯一佛，以境本則三藏如來，於色相上四見不同。	Speaking generally, the original is only one Buddha. From the perspective of the realm, the Tripiṭaka Tathāgata, in terms of form and appearance, has four different views.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b09_12']	以本迹則本是圓佛、垂為三迹。	以本迹則本是圓佛、垂為三迹。	From the perspective of the original and traces, the original is the perfect Buddha, manifesting as the three traces.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b10_11']	以真中則四教各二，而有三雙感應之別。	以真中則四教各二，而有三雙感應之別。	From the perspective of the true and provisional, the four teachings each have two, and there are three pairs of different responsive activities.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b11_7']	以體用則其體本一而用有四云云。	以體用則其體本一而用有四云云。	From the perspective of essence and function, the essence is originally one, but the function has four, and so on.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b12_3']	得是諸意，四佛同異之論無壅矣。	得是諸意，四佛同異之論無壅矣。	Obtaining these meanings, the discussion of the similarities and differences between the four Buddhas is unobstructed.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b14_10']	今且從當分以明，謂佛者翻名曰覺，覺有自他亦曰覺滿，能覺世出世間因果之法，所謂苦集道滅是也。	今且從當分以明，謂佛者翻名曰覺，覺有自他亦曰覺滿，能覺世出世間因果之法，所謂苦集道滅是也。	Now, following the individual aspects to clarify, it is said that the Buddha is translated as enlightened one. Enlightenment has self and other, and is also called perfect enlightenment. It is able to enlighten the worldly and world-transcending causes and effects, namely suffering, accumulation, path, and cessation.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b15_18']	身壽八十等者，示同人法，雖出乎人而未離乎人，猶劣應而已。	身壽八十等者，示同人法，雖出乎人而未離乎人，猶劣應而已。	Eighty years of life and so on show the same human characteristics. Although he transcends humans, he has not yet left humans, and is still an inferior response body.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b17_11']	三十四心即八忍、八智、九無礙、九解脫，總不出智斷二德，能破見思者也。	三十四心即八忍、八智、九無礙、九解脫，總不出智斷二德，能破見思者也。	The thirty-four mental states are the eight forbearances, eight knowledges, nine unobstructed [paths], and nine liberated [paths]. In total, they do not go beyond the two virtues of wisdom and elimination, which can destroy the views and attachments.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b18_19']	樹下成佛，所謂木菩提樹，簡異七寶故也，即三藏佛示成道相。	樹下成佛，所謂木菩提樹，簡異七寶故也，即三藏佛示成道相。	Becoming a Buddha under a tree, the so-called bodhi tree, distinguishes it from the seven treasures. It is the appearance of attaining enlightenment shown by the Tripiṭaka Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b21_7']	帶丈六像現尊特身者，通被衍門利鈍二機，故所見相勝劣不同，所謂合身尊特者是，而實一佛機見有異。	帶丈六像現尊特身者，通被衍門利鈍二機，故所見相勝劣不同，所謂合身尊特者是，而實一佛機見有異。	Wearing the image of the twelve-foot Buddha and manifesting the majestic body, it is for the sake of the sharp and dull capacities in the Mahāyāna gate. Therefore, the seen appearances are different in superiority and inferiority. The so-called combined majestic body is this, but in reality, it is one Buddha with different perceptions due to the capacities.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b22_8']	非謂大邊存小名之為帶，言合言共亦義云爾。	非謂大邊存小名之為帶，言合言共亦義云爾。	It is not said that the small is retained at the great limit, and is called wearing. The words combined and shared also have this meaning.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b23_1']	舊多錯解，故略示之云云。	舊多錯解，故略示之云云。	The old often misunderstand, so I have briefly shown it.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b26_2']	一念相應者，謂不同藏以三十四心漸修頓斷，今以智則一念相應與空無間，而斷有前後，則正使先已斷盡至果，但盡餘殘習氣而已。	一念相應者，謂不同藏以三十四心漸修頓斷，今以智則一念相應與空無間，而斷有前後，則正使先已斷盡至果，但盡餘殘習氣而已。	As for one thought of correspondence, it means unlike the Tripiṭaka Teaching's gradual cultivation and sudden elimination in thirty-four mental states, now with wisdom there is one thought of correspondence and no interval with emptiness, while the elimination has a before and after. Then the fundamental afflictions are already completely eliminated and reaching fruition, only the remaining habitual tendencies are completely eliminated.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b27_4']	有異乎藏者，大小教門為機設化不同故也云云。	有異乎藏者，大小教門為機設化不同故也云云。	There is a difference from the Tripiṭaka Teaching because the Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna teaching gates are established to transform according to the capacities differently.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b28_3']	別佛相者，唯現巍巍堂堂尊崇特勝之身。	別佛相者，唯現巍巍堂堂尊崇特勝之身。	As for the characteristics of the Buddha, only the majestic, lofty, venerable, and especially distinguished body is manifested.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291b29_6']	受佛記者，亦曰受佛職，即色究竟天受佛職者是也。	受佛記者，亦曰受佛職，即色究竟天受佛職者是也。	As for receiving the Buddha's prediction, it is also called receiving the Buddha's office. It is those who receive the Buddha's office in the Heaven of the Pinnacle of Existence.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c01_4']	此與《華嚴》應相全同，而位次升降有異。	此與《華嚴》應相全同，而位次升降有異。	This is completely the same as the characteristics of the response in the Huayan [Teaching], but the elevation and lowering of the stages are different.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c02_5']	在彼則以究竟果位升之，是為一化應相之始；	在彼則以究竟果位升之，是為一化應相之始；	In that [teaching], it is elevated to the ultimate fruition stage, which is the beginning of the characteristics of the response in one transformation;
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c03_17']	此當別教教道始斷一十二品無明，以權教行位降之，則止受佛職而已。	此當別教教道始斷一十二品無明，以權教行位降之，則止受佛職而已。	Here, it is lowered to the beginning of the teaching path in the Distinct Teaching, which has just eliminated twelve of the ten thousand kinds of ignorance, and only receives the Buddha's office in the provisional teaching and stages.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c05_3']	一往似同而實大異，雖異而同，未易定判，更當詳之云云。	一往似同而實大異，雖異而同，未易定判，更當詳之云云。	At first glance, it seems the same, but in reality it is very different. Although different, it is the same, and it is not easy to make a definitive judgment. We should discuss it further.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c07_4']	圓佛相者，不同前三，故曰隱前唯示不可思議如虛空相，要亦不離常所現相，以圓機一故。	圓佛相者，不同前三，故曰隱前唯示不可思議如虛空相，要亦不離常所現相，以圓機一故。	The perfect Buddha's appearance is different from the previous three, so it is said to conceal the previous and only show the inconceivable appearance like empty space. The essential point is also not apart from the commonly manifested appearance, because the perfect capacity is one.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c09_15']	得以稱性同虛空等法界，唯依心現，不可以言言、不可以識識，如是體了是謂究竟法身，故曰吾今此身即是法身。	得以稱性同虛空等法界，唯依心現，不可以言言、不可以識識，如是體了是謂究竟法身，故曰吾今此身即是法身。	It can be said to be in accordance with the nature, the same as empty space, and the Dharma realm, only manifested by the mind. It cannot be spoken of with words, and cannot be cognized with consciousness. Understanding this essence is called the ultimate Dharma body, so it is said, My present body is the Dharma body.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c10_2']	記復遮之曰：	記復遮之曰：	The record further blocks it, saying:
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c11_3']	非如太虛名為圓佛，政恐學者因言錯會故也。	非如太虛名為圓佛，政恐學者因言錯會故也。	It is not like empty space that is called the perfect Buddha. It is precisely because it fears that learners will misunderstand due to the words.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c11_13']	此深有意，宜可思之。	此深有意，宜可思之。	This has a deep meaning, and should be contemplated.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c12_1']	像法決疑下，引證。	像法決疑下，引證。	Below Resolving Doubts in the Semblance Dharma, it cites evidence.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c13_13']	四佛中，言或見蓮華臺等證別佛者，豈非應相全同華嚴而位次升降之異？	四佛中，言或見蓮華臺等證別佛者，豈非應相全同華嚴而位次升降之異？	Among the four Buddhas, it is said that some see the lotus platform and so forth as the separate Buddha. Isn't it that the appearance of the response is completely the same as the Flower Ornament Sutra, but the difference is in the elevation of the stages?
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c14_3']	餘三證義大略可知。	餘三證義大略可知。	The meaning of the other three proofs can be roughly understood.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c15_7']	本迹中以三佛為迹、一佛為本者，此約體用本迹言之。	本迹中以三佛為迹、一佛為本者，此約體用本迹言之。	In the original and trace, using the three Buddhas as the trace and the one Buddha as the original, this is speaking from the perspective of the original and trace of essence and function.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c16_9']	若以《法華》開顯部旨，所謂本是圓佛、垂為三迹。	若以《法華》開顯部旨，所謂本是圓佛、垂為三迹。	If using the opening and revealing of the purport of the Lotus Sutra, it is said that the original is the perfect Buddha, and the three traces are manifested.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c18_1']	又曰若得實意方知四佛體用同殊，與今對論，固不可同日而語云云。	又曰若得實意方知四佛體用同殊，與今對論，固不可同日而語云云。	It is also said that if one obtains the true meaning, one will know that the essence and function of the four Buddhas are the same but different. Compared with the present discussion, it cannot be spoken of on the same day.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c19_2']	約四佛明觀心者，不出以四句三觀攝今四佛。	約四佛明觀心者，不出以四句三觀攝今四佛。	In using the four Buddhas to clarify the contemplation of the mind, it does not go beyond using the four statements and three contemplations to include the present four Buddhas.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c20_17']	即于一念圓見三身，既見自心心佛不二，覺境斯契，亦託佛觀心之旨也云云。	即于一念圓見三身，既見自心心佛不二，覺境斯契，亦託佛觀心之旨也云云。	In a single thought, one fully sees the three bodies. Since one sees one's own mind and the Buddha of the mind are non-dual, the realm of enlightenment is in accord with this. It is also the purport of relying on the Buddha to contemplate the mind.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c21_14']	釋住者，謂佛具三身，住處有八云云。	釋住者，謂佛具三身，住處有八云云。	In explaining abiding, it means that the Buddha is endowed with the three bodies, and there are eight abodes.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c22_16']	大率西竺論家分別名義類多如此，然亦無可不可。	大率西竺論家分別名義類多如此，然亦無可不可。	Generally speaking, the Indian masters of debate classify names and meanings in many ways like this, but there is nothing right or wrong about it.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c24_12']	以今言之，佛本無住，無住之住有事有理，理住即第一義空，事住則如上分別。	以今言之，佛本無住，無住之住有事有理，理住即第一義空，事住則如上分別。	From the present perspective, the Buddha originally has no abode. The abode of no abode has both phenomena and principles. The abode of principle is the supreme truth of emptiness, while the abode of phenomena is as distinguished above.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c25_2']	然則與向何以異邪？	然則與向何以異邪？	Then, how is it different from before?
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c27_1']	苟曰無住無不住，則無在無不在，但本其實、神其化，則可限其數、定其量，則未之敢聞。	苟曰無住無不住，則無在無不在，但本其實、神其化，則可限其數、定其量，則未之敢聞。	If it is said to be without abode or not without abode, then it is neither present nor absent. But if one grasps its actuality and understands its transformation, then one can limit its number and determine its quantity, but I dare not hear of it.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c27_13']	分別如此，義不可盡云云。	分別如此，義不可盡云云。	The distinctions are like this, and the meaning cannot be exhausted, and so on.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0291c29_6']	約教釋住者，不出依四教門，由體析巧拙、次不次等，入證二理以為所住故。	約教釋住者，不出依四教門，由體析巧拙、次不次等，入證二理以為所住故。	As for the explanation of abode in terms of the teachings, it does not go beyond the four teaching methods, which are based on the skillful and unskillful analysis of the essence, the gradual and non-gradual entry into the two truths as the abode.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0292a01_17']	從能入門則有四，依所住理則唯二，二則真中之別、四乃即離之殊。	從能入門則有四，依所住理則唯二，二則真中之別、四乃即離之殊。	From the perspective of the methods of entry, there are four, but from the perspective of the truths that are abided in, there are only two. The two are distinguished as true and provisional, while the four are distinguished as immediate and distant.
['ZH_T33_1706_002:0292a03_7']	而言有涅槃祕藏異者，謂涅槃則從真空得名，祕藏則以三德受稱。	而言有涅槃祕藏異者，謂涅槃則從真空得名，祕藏則以三德受稱。	As for saying there is a secret treasury of nirvana that is different, it means that nirvana is named after true emptiness, while the secret treasury is called after the three virtues.

Therefore, it can be said that it was taught to those of lesser capacity and also to those who are gradually led to the Mahayana.

Therefore, we know that although their traces are the same as ordinary beings, their roots are all arhats and bodhisattvas and so forth.

The first is the stage of dry wisdom of the śrāvakas, which is the same as the common practice above. The practices and stages and merits are completely the same as the Tripiṭaka, and therefore it is called śrāvaka.
