Because it is distant, it is unable to transcend and give rise to the fourth [stage]. Therefore, among the seven undefiled meditative attainments, immediately after the first meditative absorption, six [attainments] arise, namely the two of its own [stage], the pure and undefiled [attainments] of the second and third [stages].
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0968c17_16']	無所有處無間生七，謂自下六上地唯淨。	無所有處無間生七，謂自下六上地唯淨。	Immediately after the sphere of nothingness, seven [attainments] arise, namely the six of its own [stage] and the pure [attainment] of the upper stage.

['ZH_T29_1563_039:0968c27_14']	謂為自地煩惱所逼，於下淨定亦生尊重，故有從染生次下淨，極相違故不生無漏。	謂為自地煩惱所逼，於下淨定亦生尊重，故有從染生次下淨，極相違故不生無漏。	Immediately after the pure concentration of the first trance state, seven states arise: the pure and defiled states of its own stage, the pure and defiled states of the second trance state, and the pure state of the third trance state. Immediately after the second trance state, eight states arise: the pure and defiled states of its own stage, the pure and defiled states of the first and third trance states, and the pure state of the fourth trance state. Immediately after the sphere of infinite space, nine states arise: the pure and defiled states of its own stage, the pure and defiled states of the first three trance states, and the pure state of the fourth trance state. Immediately after the sphere of infinite consciousness, ten states arise: the pure and defiled states of its own stage, the pure and defiled states of the first three trance states, and the pure and defiled states of the sphere of nothingness. Immediately after the remaining formless states, eleven states arise: the pure and defiled states of its own stage, the pure and defiled states of the first three trance states, and the pure and defiled states of the sphere of infinite space.
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0968c29_3']	若於染淨能正了知，可能從染轉生下淨，是則此淨還從淨生。	若於染淨能正了知，可能從染轉生下淨，是則此淨還從淨生。	If one can understand defilement and purity well, one can transform from defilement and generate a lower purity. In that case, this purity is generated from purity.
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a01_11']	以正了知是淨攝故，非諸染污能正了知，如何彼能從染生淨？	以正了知是淨攝故，非諸染污能正了知，如何彼能從染生淨？	This is because correct understanding is included in purity. Defiled states do not understand well. How can they generate purity from defilement?
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a01_16']	先願力故。	先願力故。	It is due to the power of a previous vow.
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a02_2']	謂先願言：	謂先願言：	That is, one previously vows,
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a02_12']	寧得下淨，不須上染。	寧得下淨，不須上染。	“I would rather obtain a lower purity than an upper defilement.”
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a03_10']	先願勢力隨相續轉，故後從染生下淨定。	先願勢力隨相續轉，故後從染生下淨定。	The power of the previous vow transforms according to the continuity. Therefore, later, from defilement, a lower pure samādhi is generated.
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a04_8']	如先立願方趣睡眠，至所期時便能覺寤。	如先立願方趣睡眠，至所期時便能覺寤。	It is like making a vow beforehand to go to sleep and being able to awaken at the appointed time.
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a05_12']	如是所說淨染生染，但約在定淨及染說，若生淨染。	如是所說淨染生染，但約在定淨及染說，若生淨染。	The above discussion of the generation of purity from pure and defiled samādhis and the generation of defilement from pure samādhis is only about samādhi in the state of meditative equipoise. If one generates purity or defilement from birth,
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a06_15']	生染不然，謂命終時從生得淨，一一無間生一切染。	生染不然，謂命終時從生得淨，一一無間生一切染。	the generation of defilement is not the same. That is, at the time of death, from the purity of birth, each and every one generates all defilements.
['ZH_T29_1563_039:0969a08_4']	若從生染一一無間能生自地一切下染，不生上者未離下故。	若從生染一一無間能生自地一切下染，不生上者未離下故。	If from the defilement of birth, each and every one generates the lower defilements of its own stage, it does not generate the higher ones, because it has not yet been separated from the lower ones.

Each stage has four [kinds], but the peak of existence has only three, because there is no higher stage to which one can proceed, so there are none in that stage that correspond to the stage of advancement.

Therefore, all pure dharmas are born only from this.

Those conducive to abiding are those that, dwelling in them, one neither regresses nor advances. Those conducive to advancement are those that, dwelling in them, one can advance. Those conducive to penetrating insight are those that, dwelling in them, one gives rise to the noble path.
