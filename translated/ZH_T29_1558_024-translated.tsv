It has already been explained that those who abide in the fruit but have not yet eliminated the afflictions to be eliminated in cultivation are called stream-enterers, who will be reborn a maximum of seven times.

If he eliminates the sixth category, he becomes a once-returner. He is called a once-returner because he returns to this world only once from the heavens. After this, there is no more rebirth.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124a12_16']	此或名曰薄貪瞋癡，唯餘下品貪瞋癡故。	此或名曰薄貪瞋癡，唯餘下品貪瞋癡故。	He is also called one who is thin in greed, anger, and delusion, because only the inferior categories of greed, anger, and delusion remain.

You should know that afflictions are also the same as karma, because they transcend the stage of the homogeneous cause and the fully ripened effect of that realm.

You should know that he is also called the candidate for the fruit of non-returner.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124b01_3']	先斷三四七八品惑入見諦者，後得果時乃至未修後勝果道，仍不名曰家家一間，未成治彼無漏根故。	先斷三四七八品惑入見諦者，後得果時乃至未修後勝果道，仍不名曰家家一間，未成治彼無漏根故。	One who has previously eliminated three, four, seven, or eight categories of delusions of the realm of desire to be eliminated by the path of cultivation and enters the path of insight, even though he has attained the fruit, as long as he has not yet cultivated the superior path of the subsequent fruit, he is still not called a once-returner or one interval, because he has not yet formed the pure faculties that counteract those delusions.

['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c09_4']	即此復有三種差別，全超、半超、遍歿異故。	即此復有三種差別，全超、半超、遍歿異故。	This is of three kinds, because of differences of total overcoming, half overcoming, and complete death.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c11_12']	言全超者，謂在欲界於四靜慮已具雜修，遇緣退失上三靜慮，以初靜慮愛味為緣，命終上生梵眾天處。	言全超者，謂在欲界於四靜慮已具雜修，遇緣退失上三靜慮，以初靜慮愛味為緣，命終上生梵眾天處。	Total overcoming means that one who in the realm of desire has already mixed the four trance states loses the three higher trance states because of encountering conditions, and by the condition of craving the bliss of the first trance state, one’s life ends and one is reborn in the heaven of great Brahma.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c14_2']	由於先世串習勢力，復能雜修第四靜慮，從彼處歿生色究竟，最初處歿生最後天，頓越中間是全超義。	由於先世串習勢力，復能雜修第四靜慮，從彼處歿生色究竟，最初處歿生最後天，頓越中間是全超義。	By the power of their repeated practice in previous lives, they are able to mix the fourth trance state and, having died from that state, are born in the heaven of the summit of existence. They die in the first place and are born in the last heaven, suddenly passing over the intermediate heavens, which is the meaning of total transcendence.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c16_2']	言半超者，從彼漸次生下淨居，乃至中間能越一處生色究竟，超非全故名為半超。	言半超者，從彼漸次生下淨居，乃至中間能越一處生色究竟，超非全故名為半超。	Those who are half transcenders are born in the lower pure abodes in order, and finally are born in the heaven of the summit of existence, having passed over one place, because their transcendence is not total, it is called half transcendence.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c17_2']	聖必不生大梵天處，僻見處故、一導師故。	聖必不生大梵天處，僻見處故、一導師故。	Holy beings are definitely not born in the heaven of the great brahma kings, because that place is perverse in views and has only one leader.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c19_1']	言遍歿者，從彼漸次於一切處皆遍受生，最後方能生色究竟，一切處死故名遍歿。	言遍歿者，從彼漸次於一切處皆遍受生，最後方能生色究竟，一切處死故名遍歿。	Those who die everywhere are born in all places in order, and finally are able to be born in the heaven of the summit of existence, because they die in all places, it is called dying everywhere.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c20_10']	無不還者，於已生處受第二生，由彼於生容求勝進，非等劣故。	無不還者，於已生處受第二生，由彼於生容求勝進，非等劣故。	There are no nonreturners who experience a second birth in the place where they were born, because they seek to advance to a superior place of birth, not to an equal or inferior one.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c21_10']	即由此故不還義滿，必不還生曾生處故。	即由此故不還義滿，必不還生曾生處故。	It is precisely because of this that the meaning of nonreturner is fulfilled, because they definitely do not return to be born in the place where they were born.
['ZH_T29_1558_024:0124c22_3']	尚不生本處，況有生於下。	尚不生本處，況有生於下。	They do not even take rebirth in their original place, much less in a lower level.
