Hearing good, one does not immediately rejoice; hearing evil, one does not immediately become angry. One is able to forbear both good and evil, thus it is called benevolence.

['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c09_14']	三界結盡則王安隱，此二乘所得名為仁王。	三界結盡則王安隱，此二乘所得名為仁王。	001	When the bonds of the three realms are exhausted, the king is at ease. This is what is attained by the two vehicles and is called the benevolent king.

If one contemplates that all dharmas, form is precisely emptiness, unborn and unceasing, like an illusion and a transformation, the afflictions of the three realms are suddenly severed at once, and one abides in the city of the provisional vehicle outside the realm. Giving rise to the thought of having already crossed over and the thought of being at ease, this is the three vehicles' people together practicing the ten grounds, able to protect the remaining city of the provisional vehicle, and each attaining the title of king.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c14_11']	此通教意。	此通教意。	001	This is the meaning of the Shared Teaching.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c16_14']	若觀諸法空即是色，色無邊故般若等法亦復無邊，雖復無邊而與心不相妨礙，如函大蓋大。	若觀諸法空即是色，色無邊故般若等法亦復無邊，雖復無邊而與心不相妨礙，如函大蓋大。	001	If one contemplates that emptiness is precisely form, because form is boundless, prajñā and other dharmas are also boundless. Although boundless, they do not obstruct the mind, like a large box with a large lid.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c19_17']	而無邊之法在一心中，一一法中具諸佛法，從於初地乃至妙覺，分分圓滿住蓮華臺，不動不轉能動能轉，即十地菩薩住檀等六各各為王。	而無邊之法在一心中，一一法中具諸佛法，從於初地乃至妙覺，分分圓滿住蓮華臺，不動不轉能動能轉，即十地菩薩住檀等六各各為王。	001	And the boundless dharmas are in a single mind. In each dharma, all Buddha-dharmas are complete. From the first ground up to wondrous enlightenment, each part is perfectly fulfilled, abiding in the lotus flower platform, unmoving and yet able to move, able to turn, this is the bodhisattvas of the ten grounds abiding in giving and the other six perfections, each acting as king.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c20_5']	此別教意也。	此別教意也。	001	This is the meaning of the Distinct Teaching.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c24_5']	若觀諸法本來不生、今則無滅，雖無生滅，生滅宛然，雙照雙亡契乎中道廣大如法界、究竟若虛空，即從初住乃至佛地，四十二心分分明證中道之理，住常寂光各得稱王。	若觀諸法本來不生、今則無滅，雖無生滅，生滅宛然，雙照雙亡契乎中道廣大如法界、究竟若虛空，即從初住乃至佛地，四十二心分分明證中道之理，住常寂光各得稱王。	001	If one contemplates that all dharmas are originally unborn and now have no cessation, although there is no birth or cessation, birth and cessation are still evident. Dually illuminating and dually extinguishing, one accords with the middle way, vast like the Dharma realm, and ultimately like space. Then, from the first abode up to the stage of Buddhahood, the forty-two minds clearly and distinctly realize the principle of the middle way, abiding in the eternally quiescent light, each attaining the title of king.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c24_11']	此圓教意也。	此圓教意也。	001	This is the meaning of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c27_7']	又三藏中，羅漢支佛煩惱盡故得仁王，菩薩及果向忍見思未盡但名王不名仁也，通教佛地別教妙覺圓教極果各是仁王。	又三藏中，羅漢支佛煩惱盡故得仁王，菩薩及果向忍見思未盡但名王不名仁也，通教佛地別教妙覺圓教極果各是仁王。	001	Moreover, in the Tripiṭaka teaching, the arhats and pratyekabuddhas are called benevolent kings because they have exhausted afflictions. Bodhisattvas and those in the stages of forbearance and insight who have not yet exhausted their views and thoughts are only called kings and not benevolent. In the shared teaching, the stage of Buddhahood; in the distinct teaching, the stage of wondrous enlightenment; and in the perfect teaching, the ultimate fruition—each is a benevolent king.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c28_4']	當教自有優劣，若非仁則是王也。	當教自有優劣，若非仁則是王也。	001	Within each teaching, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority. If it is not benevolent, then it is a king.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0253c29_9']	若約本迹，即三教之仁王為迹，圓教之仁王為本。	若約本迹，即三教之仁王為迹，圓教之仁王為本。	001	If we discuss in terms of the provisional and the actual, then the benevolent kings of the three teachings are provisional, while the benevolent kings of the perfect teaching are actual.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a03_2']	分論本迹，則圓教十行能為別教之本，通教佛地即是別教之迹，三藏二乘復是通教中本，展轉當教各有本迹云云。	分論本迹，則圓教十行能為別教之本，通教佛地即是別教之迹，三藏二乘復是通教中本，展轉當教各有本迹云云。	001	If we discuss the fundamental and provisional in terms of the teachings, then the ten practices of the perfect teaching can be the foundation for the separate teaching, and the buddha stage of the common teaching is precisely the provisional of the separate teaching. The two vehicles of the three-stage teaching are the foundation within the common teaching. Each teaching has its own fundamental and provisional.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a04_17']	觀心者，觀生滅法，見色是有析之至空，心於色上而得自在，此生滅觀心仁王也。	觀心者，觀生滅法，見色是有析之至空，心於色上而得自在，此生滅觀心仁王也。	001	As for contemplating the mind, contemplating the dharma of arising and ceasing, seeing form as existent and analyzing it to emptiness, the mind attains mastery over form. This is the contemplation of the mind of the king of the stage of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a05_18']	觀色即是空、空色自在，此無生觀心仁王也。	觀色即是空、空色自在，此無生觀心仁王也。	001	Contemplating form as precisely emptiness, emptiness and form are sovereign. This is the contemplation of the mind of the king of the stage of non-arising.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a07_4']	若觀空即是色，次第而入中道正觀，此無量觀心仁王也。	若觀空即是色，次第而入中道正觀，此無量觀心仁王也。	001	If one contemplates emptiness as precisely form, gradually entering the correct contemplation of the middle way, this is the contemplation of the mind of the king of the stage of the immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a10_3']	若觀色空空色不二而二、二而無二，雙照雙亡，此是實相一心三觀、三觀一心，如彼天目不縱不橫而得自在，此圓教觀心仁王也。	若觀色空空色不二而二、二而無二，雙照雙亡，此是實相一心三觀、三觀一心，如彼天目不縱不橫而得自在，此圓教觀心仁王也。	001	If one contemplates form and emptiness, emptiness and form are non-dual yet dual, dual yet non-dual, illuminating both and forgetting both. This is the contemplation of the mind of the perfect teaching, the contemplation of the one mind of true suchness, the contemplation of the one mind of the three contemplations, like the heavenly eye that is neither vertical nor horizontal yet attains mastery. This is the contemplation of the mind of the king of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a12_2']	我今聖主道化無方，子育蒼生仁恩普洽，恒以三觀安隱色心，迹尚叵窮，本誠難究矣。	我今聖主道化無方，子育蒼生仁恩普洽，恒以三觀安隱色心，迹尚叵窮，本誠難究矣。	001	I am now the sage-king, whose way of transforming the world is without bounds. I nurture the people of the world with benevolence and kindness, and always use the three contemplations to bring peace to body and mind. His traces are still difficult to fathom, and his essence is truly hard to investigate.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a13_13']	「般若」者，此云智慧，即《智論》四十二卷中釋也，開善藏法師並用此說。	「般若」者，此云智慧，即《智論》四十二卷中釋也，開善藏法師並用此說。	001	Prajñā means wisdom, which is explained in the 42-fascicle Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom. The Dharma Master of Kaishan Temple all use this explanation.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a14_4']	論第七十又有一解云：	論第七十又有一解云：	001	In the 70th chapter of the treatise, there is another explanation:

['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a15_12']	般若甚深極重，智慧輕薄，是故不能稱。	般若甚深極重，智慧輕薄，是故不能稱。	001	Prajñā is extremely profound and heavy, while wisdom is light and shallow, therefore it cannot fathom it.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a16_19']	莊嚴旻師以此文說般若名含眾義，智慧唯是一門，非正翻譯。	莊嚴旻師以此文說般若名含眾義，智慧唯是一門，非正翻譯。	001	Master Zhuangyan used this text to explain that the name Prajñā contains many meanings, while wisdom is only one aspect, and is not the correct translation.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a17_13']	詳二師說各成諍競，今為通之。	詳二師說各成諍競，今為通之。	001	Examining the explanations of the two masters, each leads to disputes. Now I will reconcile them.

['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a19_8']	實則圓教，權則前三。	實則圓教，權則前三。	001	The real is the perfect teaching, the provisional is the first three teachings.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a20_7']	又權不可翻，即三藏實色不可令色即是空。	又權不可翻，即三藏實色不可令色即是空。	001	Moreover, the provisional cannot be translated, meaning that the real form in the three treasuries cannot be made to be identical with emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a21_16']	實即可翻，即三智也，通教一切智、別教道種智、圓教一切種智。	實即可翻，即三智也，通教一切智、別教道種智、圓教一切種智。	001	The real can be translated, referring to the three kinds of wisdom: the wisdom of all things in the Shared Teaching, the wisdom of the path of the particular teachings, and the wisdom of all things in the Perfect Teaching.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a22_8']	豈可各固一見以局大方？	豈可各固一見以局大方？	001	How can one stick to one's own view and confine the great Dharma?
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a23_1']	火炎不可取，實當有在也。	火炎不可取，實當有在也。	001	The blazing fire cannot be grasped, but it must exist in reality.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a23_11']	然智與慧，經論解殊。	然智與慧，經論解殊。	001	However, wisdom and discernment are explained differently in the sūtras and treatises.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a24_8']	《成實》合釋，云「真慧名智」，即慧是智也。	《成實》合釋，云「真慧名智」，即慧是智也。	001	The Satyasiddhi combines the explanations, saying that true discernment is called wisdom, so discernment is wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a25_18']	《淨名》離說，「知一切眾生心念，如應說法，起於智業，不取不捨入一相門。	《淨名》離說，「知一切眾生心念，如應說法，起於智業，不取不捨入一相門。	001	The Vimalakīrti Sūtra explains them separately: Knowing the thoughts of all sentient beings and speaking the Dharma accordingly, one gives rise to the activity of wisdom without grasping or abandoning, entering the gate of the single characteristic.
['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254a26_7']	」起於慧業者，釋云：	」起於慧業者，釋云：	001	As for giving rise to the activity of discernment, the commentary says:

['ZH_T33_1705_001:0254b03_9']	」故知人王行仁不求恩報。	」故知人王行仁不求恩報。	001	Therefore, we know that the benevolent king practices benevolence without seeking rewards for his kindness.
