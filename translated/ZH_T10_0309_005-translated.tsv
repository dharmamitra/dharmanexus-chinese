The name of right enlightenment is not seen as tainted or attached. All dharmas are not seen as transcending. Equally manifesting the three vehicles, one does not see where they go, and is not attached to the world. Understanding names and appellations are without past, present, or future.
['ZH_T10_0309_005:0998b07_2']	所謂名相，謂一切智亦名法界，懷來道故將護彼志不傷其心。	所謂名相，謂一切智亦名法界，懷來道故將護彼志不傷其心。	Namely, name and form, referring to omniscience, is also called the dharma realm, because it embraces the Way. Protecting their aspirations does not injure their minds.

['ZH_T10_0309_005:0998b08_14']	斯諸法者亦無處所，來亦不知所從來處，去亦不知為從何滅。	斯諸法者亦無處所，來亦不知所從來處，去亦不知為從何滅。	These dharmas also have no location. When coming, they do not know where they come from, and when going, they do not know where they go to.
['ZH_T10_0309_005:0998b12_6']	菩薩行戒忍辱精進亦復如是，戒亦無戒忍亦無忍，解知精進不見有進，若人持戒恒護彼短，設見毀戒不以為恨，見戒完具不受用喜，是謂菩薩成就於戒。	菩薩行戒忍辱精進亦復如是，戒亦無戒忍亦無忍，解知精進不見有進，若人持戒恒護彼短，設見毀戒不以為恨，見戒完具不受用喜，是謂菩薩成就於戒。	The bodhisattva's practice of precepts, patience, and diligence is also like this. Precepts are also without precepts, patience is also without patience, and understanding diligence does not see any progress. If a person upholds the precepts and always protects others' shortcomings, even if they see those who violate the precepts, they do not bear resentment. Seeing complete precepts, they do not accept or delight in their use. This is called the bodhisattva's accomplishment in the precepts.
['ZH_T10_0309_005:0998b16_2']	菩薩行忍心不增減，有人來取菩薩身體節節支解，執心堅固不可沮壞，菩薩具施戒忍精進禪思智慧，其想著斷心不懷二，不起不滅興若干念，於諸罪福平等無二。	菩薩行忍心不增減，有人來取菩薩身體節節支解，執心堅固不可沮壞，菩薩具施戒忍精進禪思智慧，其想著斷心不懷二，不起不滅興若干念，於諸罪福平等無二。	The bodhisattva practices patience with an unwavering mind. If someone comes and takes the bodhisattva's body, cutting it into pieces, the bodhisattva's firm mind cannot be destroyed. The bodhisattva possesses the practices of giving, precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. Cutting off attachment to these concepts, the mind does not harbor duality, neither arising nor ceasing, giving rise to various thoughts, and regarding all sins and merits as equal and non-dual.

['ZH_T10_0309_005:0998b25_3']	菩薩進前修其道果，聖道自然不見邊岸，若有人來求其端緒，於賢聖法則為自損。	菩薩進前修其道果，聖道自然不見邊岸，若有人來求其端緒，於賢聖法則為自損。	The bodhisattva advances and cultivates the fruit of the path, the noble path is naturally unseen on the edge, if someone comes and seeks its beginning, then for the method of the noble ones it is self-damaging.

Those who come do so in accordance with the combination of causes and conditions. Sound comes from the void, and the auditory consciousness goes to listen. The teachings and written documents are neither true nor real. They follow the combination of conditions and disperse according to the conditions.

When ignorance ceases, then formations cease, up to old age, sickness, and death are also like this. Observing their roots according to their types, then administer the medicine, uphold the mind firmly, and clearly understand the thoughts in the minds of the assembly. This is good conduct.

He views sentient beings as a mother loves her child, nurturing them in a timely manner without any intention of increase or decrease. He always abides in the right view and does not follow other teachings. In the great assembly, he is like a lion king. He contemplates the earth, water, fire, and wind in the body. When the earth moves, the water diminishes. When the water moves, the fire diminishes. When the fire moves, the wind diminishes. When the four elements move, the faculties decline and the spirit leaves the body. At that time, what can relatives rely on? Only the good Dharma can be relied upon.

They go to the ten directions to pay homage to and serve the buddhas, making offerings with reverence. From one buddha land to another buddha land, wherever they go, they always establish the Dharma for the sake of sentient beings, eliminating all the difficulties of beginning and end. All those who have enmity and encounter suffering and distress are naturally eliminated.

They emit a single sound with the water of the Dharma flavor of the eight liberations to spread the teachings of the Dharma, causing the trichiliocosm to universally receive liberation. Those who are liberated have aspirations like vajra, pure inside and out. Moreover, with the supernormal powers, precepts, and Dharma, they adorn their bodies with the radiant major and minor marks like a pure golden mountain.
