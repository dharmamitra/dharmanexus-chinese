Whenever there is resonance, there is response, like the echo of a valley spirit; appearing in response is like the reflection in a mirror. It delivers from the twelve links of dependent arising and raises the twelve aspects of contemplation, saving from the eight difficulties and extreme suffering by revealing the eight kinds of divine dhāraṇīs.

The merit is equal to that of the honored ones who have already accomplished, and the traces are the same as those who have not yet reached the end. Embodying the nature of dharmas, one abides in eternal quiescence, and rescuing those who are drowning in decline, one gives rise to compassion. Wisdom reaches the ultimate spirit, and the body pervades the Dharma realm. The spirit penetrates everywhere and can illuminate the three karmas with faith and respect. The power of virtue is difficult to fathom, and it skillfully rescues the suffering and difficulties of the five destinies.

['ZH_T39_1802_001:1005a27_12']	一顯現事、二隱密。	一顯現事、二隱密。	One is manifest, and the other is hidden.
['ZH_T39_1802_001:1005a29_13']	是經所說神呪祕密之事，如法行者，是菩薩大士無形能不應有情之感，故以神呪為經宗也。	是經所說神呪祕密之事，如法行者，是菩薩大士無形能不應有情之感，故以神呪為經宗也。	The secret matters of the dhāraṇī taught in this sūtra, for one who practices according to the Dharma, this bodhisattva mahāsattva has no form and is able to respond to the feelings of sentient beings, and therefore the dhāraṇī is the main point of the sūtra.

['ZH_T39_1802_001:1005b05_4']	故下經曰「百千俱胝那由他佛名、稱菩薩稱名，二功德平等平等」也。	故下經曰「百千俱胝那由他佛名、稱菩薩稱名，二功德平等平等」也。	Thus, the sutra below says, The merit of the names of hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas and the merit of the names of Bodhisattvas are equal and the same.
['ZH_T39_1802_001:1005b05_6']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T39_1802_001:1005b05_20']	此經行法於三乘行中為何行耶？	此經行法於三乘行中為何行耶？	Among the practices of the Three Vehicles, what practice does this sutra's practice method belong to?
