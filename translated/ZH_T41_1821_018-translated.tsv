['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c14_12']	不和合性以聖法上非得為體。	不和合性以聖法上非得為體。	018	The nature of non-coalescence takes the non-attainment of the holy Dharma as its essence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c15_4']	由此起故不得入聖。	由此起故不得入聖。	018	Because of this, one cannot enter the holy.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c16_10']	雖異生性先於聖法亦有非得容得入聖　空法師意說。	雖異生性先於聖法亦有非得容得入聖　空法師意說。	018	Although the nature of ordinary beings first has non-attainment of the holy Dharma, it is possible to enter the holy. Master Kong Fazhi's meaning is explained.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c17_1']	無漏八正是和合體。	無漏八正是和合體。	018	The eight correct [paths] of the uncontaminated are the essence of coalescence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c17_10']	以是聖僧和合德故。	以是聖僧和合德故。	018	Because they are the virtue of coalescence of the holy saṅgha.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c18_2']	若能破此名破法輪僧。	若能破此名破法輪僧。	018	If one can destroy this, it is called destroying the Saṅgha of the Dharma Wheel.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c18_12']	而諸論但言破凡僧者。	而諸論但言破凡僧者。	018	However, the treatises only say that one destroys the ordinary Saṅgha.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c18_18']	破有近．遠。	破有近．遠。	018	There are two kinds of destruction, near and far.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c19_13']	由近破凡事和合僧故不得入聖。	由近破凡事和合僧故不得入聖。	018	Because the near destruction of the ordinary Saṅgha destroys the concordant Saṅgha, one cannot enter the noble.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c20_1']	遠破聖僧。	遠破聖僧。	018	The far destruction is of the noble Saṅgha.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c20_10']	是故聖僧是正所破。	是故聖僧是正所破。	018	Therefore, the noble Saṅgha is the primary object of destruction.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c21_12']	由破此重獲無間罪　難云諸論但言破凡非聖。	由破此重獲無間罪　難云諸論但言破凡非聖。	018	Because of this heavy destruction, one incurs the sin of immediate retribution. The difficulty is that the treatises only say that one destroys the ordinary, not the noble.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c22_4', 'ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c22_9']	而言破聖與論相違。🔽夫論破僧。	而言破聖與論相違。 夫論破僧。	018	Yet it is said that one destroys the noble, which contradicts the treatises.🔽As for the destruction of the Saṅgha,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c22_14']	破和合性。	破和合性。	018	it destroys the nature of concord.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c23_4']	若得聖已即不可破。	若得聖已即不可破。	018	If one has already attained the noble, then one cannot be destroyed.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c23_13']	若未得聖何所破耶。	若未得聖何所破耶。	018	If one has not yet attained the noble, what is there to destroy?
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c24_4']	此即違理　今解云。	此即違理　今解云。	018	This then contradicts principle. The present explanation is as follows.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c24_17']	不和合性以和合上非得為體。	不和合性以和合上非得為體。	018	The nature of non-concord is taken as the essence of non-attainment above concord.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c25_8']	謂僧未破有和合性。	謂僧未破有和合性。	018	It is said that before the Saṅgha is destroyed, there is the nature of concord.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c25_17']	同共和合許有聖道。	同共和合許有聖道。	018	The same concord and harmony allow for the noble path.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c26_12']	僧由有此和合性故容得入聖。	僧由有此和合性故容得入聖。	018	Because the Saṅgha has this nature of concord, it is possible to enter the noble.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c26_17']	若僧被破。	若僧被破。	018	If the Saṅgha is destroyed,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c27_4']	捨和合性。	捨和合性。	018	it abandons the nature of concord.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c27_11']	有不和合性起。	有不和合性起。	018	There is a nature of non-coalescence that arises.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c28_6']	由彼破此和合性故不得入聖。	由彼破此和合性故不得入聖。	018	Because they destroy this nature of coalescence, they cannot enter the holy.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c28_11']	故成無間。	故成無間。	018	Therefore, it becomes uninterrupted.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c29_2']	既不成就彼和合性。	既不成就彼和合性。	018	Since they do not accomplish that nature of coalescence,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0276c29_16']	即以和合體上非得為不和合性。	即以和合體上非得為不和合性。	018	They take the non-attainment on the basis of the essence of coalescence as the nature of non-coalescence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a01_11']	問破僧不和合非得以為體。	問破僧不和合非得以為體。	018	Question: The non-attainment of the non-coalescence of the schism of the Saṅgha is taken as its essence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a02_15']	亦可僧和合以彼得為體　解云諸法未必皆相翻立。	亦可僧和合以彼得為體　解云諸法未必皆相翻立。	018	Can the coalescence of the Saṅgha also be taken as its attainment? Answer: The principle is not necessarily established by the mutual inversion of all dharmas.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a03_7']	如異生性以非得為體。	如異生性以非得為體。	018	Like the nature of ordinary beings, which takes non-attainment as its essence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a03_16']	聖性非唯以得為體。	聖性非唯以得為體。	018	The nature of the noble ones is not only taken as attainment.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a04_5']	問破法輪僧。	問破法輪僧。	018	Question: The schism of the Saṅgha that breaks the wheel of the Dharma,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a04_10']	破羯磨僧。	破羯磨僧。	018	The schism of the Saṅgha that breaks the karman.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a05_5']	為體同不　古德休法師解云。	為體同不　古德休法師解云。	018	Are their essences the same or not? An ancient master, Dharma Master Xu, explained:
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a05_12']	破僧體有二種。	破僧體有二種。	018	The essence of the schism of the Saṅgha is of two kinds.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a05_18']	若破法輪僧。	若破法輪僧。	018	If it is the schism of the Saṅgha that breaks the wheel of the Dharma,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a06_6']	以非擇滅為體。	以非擇滅為體。	018	It takes non-discriminative cessation as its essence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a06_12']	若破羯磨僧。	若破羯磨僧。	018	If it is the schism of the Saṅgha that breaks the karman,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a07_1']	以不和合為體。	以不和合為體。	018	It takes non-coalescence as its essence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a07_14']	法輪僧上無有和合作羯磨事。	法輪僧上無有和合作羯磨事。	018	On the Saṅgha that turns the wheel of the Dharma, there is no coalescence to perform karman.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a08_5']	唯有緣差不生法故。	唯有緣差不生法故。	018	There is only the dharma of non-arising due to the absence of conditions.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a08_13']	所以非擇滅為體。	所以非擇滅為體。	018	Therefore, it is not taken as having non-analytical cessation as its essence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a09_6']	羯磨僧有和合作羯磨事。	羯磨僧有和合作羯磨事。	018	The Saṃgha of the Karma Saṃgha has the function of performing karmas together.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a09_16']	後被破已由捨和合故。	後被破已由捨和合故。	018	After being split, because of abandoning the unity,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a11_5']	以不和合為體　難云若說破羯磨僧以不和合為性。	以不和合為體　難云若說破羯磨僧以不和合為性。	018	it takes non-unity as its essence. It is argued that if it is said that the split in the Karma Saṃgha takes non-unity as its nature,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a11_10']	此亦無違。	此亦無違。	018	this is also not contradictory.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a12_6']	若言破法輪僧以非擇滅為體。	若言破法輪僧以非擇滅為體。	018	If it is said that the split in the Dharma-Wheel Saṃgha takes non-analytical cessation as its essence,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a12_11']	此即不然。	此即不然。	018	this is not so.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a13_6']	諸論皆說所破僧體不和合性。	諸論皆說所破僧體不和合性。	018	All treatises say that the essence of the split Saṃgha is the nature of non-unity.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a13_15']	言破法輪非擇滅性。	言破法輪非擇滅性。	018	It is said that the split in the Dharma-Wheel Saṃgha has the nature of non-analytical cessation.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a14_1']	豈不相違。	豈不相違。	018	How could this not be contradictory?
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a14_10']	若言論據羯磨僧說。	若言論據羯磨僧說。	018	If it is said that the treatises speak in terms of the Karma Saṃgha,

['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a15_9']	論據法輪僧故　又空法師意解。	論據法輪僧故　又空法師意解。	018	Because the treatises speak in terms of the Dharma-Wheel Saṃgha. The meaning of the master Kong's understanding is:
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a15_15']	若破法輪僧。	若破法輪僧。	018	If there is a split in the Dharma-Wheel Saṃgha,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a16_8']	以法輪理和合上非得為體。	以法輪理和合上非得為體。	018	it takes the non-attainment of the unity of the principle of the Dharma-Wheel as its essence.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a16_14']	若破羯磨僧。	若破羯磨僧。	018	If there is a split in the Karma Saṃgha,
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a18_2']	以羯磨事和合上非得為體　難云總言非得義亦不違。	以羯磨事和合上非得為體　難云總言非得義亦不違。	018	it takes the non-attainment of the unity of the karma affairs as its essence. It is argued that the general statement of non-attainment is also not contradictory in meaning.
['ZH_T41_1821_018:0277a18_17']	若言以彼聖法非得為破法輪僧體。	若言以彼聖法非得為破法輪僧體。	018	If it is said that the substance of the Saṅgha that breaks the wheel is the non-acquisition of the noble dharmas,

['ZH_T41_1821_018:0283b16_15']	或福業名顯作福義。	或福業名顯作福義。	018	Or the term 'meritorious karma' shows the meaning of creating merit.
