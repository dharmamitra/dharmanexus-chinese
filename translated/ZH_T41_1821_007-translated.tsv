['ZH_T41_1821_007:0144c08_16']	故唯未至能入欲心。	故唯未至能入欲心。	007	therefore only the mind of the stage of non-distinction can enter the desire realm mind.
['ZH_T41_1821_007:0144c09_6']	問若婆沙評家。	問若婆沙評家。	007	Question: If the definitive conclusion of the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra
['ZH_T41_1821_007:0144c09_17']	以二地心生欲心者為正。	以二地心生欲心者為正。	007	is that the mind of the two stages gives rise to the desire realm mind,
['ZH_T41_1821_007:0144c10_7']	何故出見道心中。	何故出見道心中。	007	why, in the explanation of the mind emerging from the path of seeing,

The question is: Why is it not possible to accomplish the contemplation of common characteristics in the stages prior to heat in those stages? The explanation says: Now, in this life, one enters the holy.
