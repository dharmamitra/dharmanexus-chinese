Moving yet still like the clear moon in the sky, speaking yet silent like a mani illuminating objects. Therefore, in the past the Tathagata resided on Vulture Peak, abiding in concentration and giving rise to compassion, with light radiating like the sun gathering and the mist condensing. Heavenly flowers scattered in disarray, and the mountains and valleys became level. Thus, the pure land and the defiled land were densely covered with clouds of compassion, and the holy assembly and the ordinary assembly all received the rain of Dharma.

Wisdom gives birth to the Buddhas and makes their virtues matchless. The external chapters of virtue are received through practice. The stages of practice are shallow and deep. It is not only the Buddha who speaks of this, but all Buddhas speak of it together. Because it is accomplished from causes, the fruition is perfected.

['ZH_T33_1709_01a:0429c23_7']	〈觀如來品〉云「若有人於恒河沙三千大千世界，滿中七寶以用布施大千世界一切有情皆得阿羅漢果；	〈觀如來品〉云「若有人於恒河沙三千大千世界，滿中七寶以用布施大千世界一切有情皆得阿羅漢果；	The Chapter on Contemplating the Tathāgata says, If someone were to fill the trichiliocosm with the seven treasures and use it as alms, and all sentient beings in the trichiliocosm were to attain the fruit of arhatship;

How much more so for those who copy, uphold, recite, and explain it for others - the merit they obtain is no different from that of the buddhas of the ten directions.

Even one's whole body is considered light, while half a verse is considered heavy. All buddhas speak the same correct causes for liberation.
['ZH_T33_1709_01a:0430a02_1']	若不因經無容解脫，令生解脫故說此經。	若不因經無容解脫，令生解脫故說此經。	If it were not for the sutra, there would be no liberation. In order to bring about liberation, this sutra is spoken.

The fruits of suffering in the three realms of existence revolve for a long time. Even if one gives rise to disgust and joy, one still fiercely cycles through birth and death. The various non-Buddhist paths starve themselves and throw themselves into the mountains. Although they exert great effort, it is in vain.
['ZH_T33_1709_01a:0430a05_14']	如來慜世現迹王宮，乘大智悲無倒宣說，略開五忍為十四忍。	如來慜世現迹王宮，乘大智悲無倒宣說，略開五忍為十四忍。	The Tathagata, out of compassion for the world, manifested traces in the royal palace.
