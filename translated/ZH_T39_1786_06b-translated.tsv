['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0157c26_3']	答：	答：	06b	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0157c28_1']	其實所顯理是一，能觀觀亦一，為對所破執故而分二空，顯空淺深故而寄二諦。	其實所顯理是一，能觀觀亦一，為對所破執故而分二空，顯空淺深故而寄二諦。	06b	In reality, what is revealed is one principle, and the contemplation is also one. It is in response to the attachment that is to be refuted that the two emptinesses are distinguished, and in order to reveal the shallow and deep emptinesses that the two truths are used.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0157c29_4']	是故性相空中，性空約理，理既未顯，但名世諦明空。	是故性相空中，性空約理，理既未顯，但名世諦明空。	06b	Therefore, within the emptiness of nature and characteristics, nature emptiness is based on principle. Since the principle has not yet been revealed, it is only called conventional truth and emptiness.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0157c29_19']	空猶未盡，但名性空，仍於世法。	空猶未盡，但名性空，仍於世法。	06b	Emptiness is still not exhausted, and it is only called nature emptiness, still within conventional dharmas.

Once the characteristics are refuted, the principle is revealed and is then called true reality. Once the contemplation is accomplished, it is then called characteristic emptiness. Therefore, the two truths are used to reveal the characteristics of the two emptinesses.

Therefore, when refuting the attachment to the self, it is temporarily called the emptiness of person.

['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b21_19']	諸經先須入定，定起方說；	諸經先須入定，定起方說；	06b	In various sūtras, one must first enter concentration, and only after concentration arises can one speak;
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b22_12']	今經何故一向在定而有所說耶？	今經何故一向在定而有所說耶？	06b	Why is it that this sūtra is entirely in concentration and yet there is something to be spoken?
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b22_14']	答：	答：	06b	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b23_11']	若論法性上定，豈有出入說默之異？	若論法性上定，豈有出入說默之異？	06b	If discussing the concentration above the dharma-nature, how could there be differences in entering and leaving, speaking and silence?
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b24_10']	既示其定，蓋順物機，物機所宜適樂不同。	既示其定，蓋順物機，物機所宜適樂不同。	06b	Since it demonstrates concentration, it generally accords with the capacities of beings, and the capacities of beings are suitable and delightful in different ways.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b26_6']	諸經示同往佛皆先入定，履歷法緣，對治散心妄有所說，故須入定，定起方說。	諸經示同往佛皆先入定，履歷法緣，對治散心妄有所說，故須入定，定起方說。	06b	Various sūtras demonstrate the same as the past buddhas, all first entering concentration, treading through the conditions of the Dharma, and counteracting the deluded speech of the scattered mind, therefore one must enter concentration, and only after concentration arises can one speak.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b27_2']	此經首尾在定而能說者，意同向理。	此經首尾在定而能說者，意同向理。	06b	The reason this sūtra is entirely in concentration from beginning to end and yet able to speak is that the meaning is the same as the principle.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b29_2']	又示金光明無量甚深自在無礙、寂照融遍，故說畢定起，印成三番快領如來所說法也。	又示金光明無量甚深自在無礙、寂照融遍，故說畢定起，印成三番快領如來所說法也。	06b	Moreover, it shows that the Golden Light is immeasurable, extremely profound, sovereign, unobstructed, tranquil, illuminating, and pervasive. Therefore, it speaks of definitely arising, sealing and confirming the three rounds of joyfully receiving what the Tathāgata has spoken.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159b29_10']	二、彰法性圓融。	二、彰法性圓融。	06b	Second, it reveals the perfect interfusion of the Dharma-nature.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c01_8']	言若作入法性者，顯理含容，不阻出入。	言若作入法性者，顯理含容，不阻出入。	06b	It says, If one enters the Dharma-nature, revealing that the principle encompasses and does not obstruct entering and exiting.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c02_11']	上唱法性無量甚深，一出一入有說有默，豈逾法性？	上唱法性無量甚深，一出一入有說有默，豈逾法性？	06b	Above, it proclaims the Dharma-nature to be immeasurable and extremely profound, with each exit and entry having speech and silence. How could it surpass the Dharma-nature?
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c02_18']	故云法性自在。	故云法性自在。	06b	Therefore, it says the Dharma-nature is sovereign.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c03_9']	言四佛者，即四方佛也。	言四佛者，即四方佛也。	06b	As for the four buddhas, they are the buddhas of the four directions.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c03_18']	五佛者，并釋迦耳。	五佛者，并釋迦耳。	06b	The five buddhas include Śākyamuni.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c06_16']	同處各處等者，信相室與靈鷲山雖異，若了唯心者，見唯妙土則弟子眾一，故五佛同處共一身一智也，是則四無來去、一無住在。	同處各處等者，信相室與靈鷲山雖異，若了唯心者，見唯妙土則弟子眾一，故五佛同處共一身一智也，是則四無來去、一無住在。	06b	As for the same place, different places, etc., although the room of Visākhā and Vulture Peak are different, if one understands that they are only the mind, and sees that they are only the wondrous land, then the assembly of disciples is one. Therefore, the five buddhas are in the same place, sharing the same body and the same wisdom. This means that the four have no coming and going, and the one has no abiding.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c09_9']	其執權教者弟子眾異，謂妙幢所居共佛耆山敻隔多里，故四佛五佛匪唯各處，亦見異身異智、實來實去、定住定在。	其執權教者弟子眾異，謂妙幢所居共佛耆山敻隔多里，故四佛五佛匪唯各處，亦見異身異智、實來實去、定住定在。	06b	The disciples of those who uphold the provisional teachings have different views. They say that Sudhana's abode is in Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, which is far apart from the Buddha's abode. Therefore, the four Buddhas and five Buddhas not only occupy different places, but also have different bodies, different wisdom, truly come and truly go, definitely abide and definitely reside.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c10_10']	雖此殊別，無離法性，故云隨人所覩皆無障礙也。	雖此殊別，無離法性，故云隨人所覩皆無障礙也。	06b	Although there are these differences, they are not apart from the nature of dharmas. Therefore, it is said that according to the people's perspective, there are no obstructions.

['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c12_9']	先明諸菩薩讚具三業為妙觀境。	先明諸菩薩讚具三業為妙觀境。	06b	First, it clarifies that the praises of the bodhisattvas are endowed with the three karmas as the wondrous realm of contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c13_15']	然讚雖在口，身須恭謹、心仍尊重，三業齊運讚義方成。	然讚雖在口，身須恭謹、心仍尊重，三業齊運讚義方成。	06b	Although the praise is in the mouth, the body must be respectful, and the mind still reveres it. The three karmas are used together, and only then does the meaning of praise be accomplished.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c14_4']	二、明理三觀成，二：	二、明理三觀成，二：	06b	Second, clarifying the accomplishment of the three contemplations in principle, in two parts:

['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c15_11']	言三觀心者，寄身等境示空假中能觀三觀心也。	言三觀心者，寄身等境示空假中能觀三觀心也。	06b	As for the three contemplations of the mind, it uses the realms of the body, etc. to demonstrate the three contemplations of the mind that are able to contemplate emptiness, provisional existence, and the Middle Way.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c16_7']	近有講人不知，便謂後人妄加心字。	近有講人不知，便謂後人妄加心字。	06b	Recently, some lecturers, not knowing this, say that the later person falsely added the character mind.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c17_2']	亦由向迷心為所觀，致有踳駮。	亦由向迷心為所觀，致有踳駮。	06b	It is also due to the previous confusion of taking the mind as the object of contemplation, which led to the disagreement.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c17_12']	斯之疎謬，不可云也。	斯之疎謬，不可云也。	06b	This kind of negligence and error cannot be said.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c19_3']	止如《十六觀經》本明佛觀，疏云「心觀為宗」，或不見斯意，乃妄有穿鑿。	止如《十六觀經》本明佛觀，疏云「心觀為宗」，或不見斯意，乃妄有穿鑿。	06b	It is like the Sutra of the Sixteen Contemplations, which originally clarifies the contemplation of the Buddha. The commentary says, The contemplation of the mind is the main point. Some do not see this meaning and falsely have speculations.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c19_13']	今之學者，切宜思之。	今之學者，切宜思之。	06b	The learners of today should think about this carefully.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c20_18']	觀身不得身者，先明身觀，推檢四大本無實性，名身性空；	觀身不得身者，先明身觀，推檢四大本無實性，名身性空；	06b	As for contemplating the body but not obtaining the body, first clarify the contemplation of the body. Analyzing the four elements, there is originally no real nature, called the emptiness of the nature of the body;
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c21_8']	但有名字，即身相也。	但有名字，即身相也。	06b	There are only names, which are the characteristics of the body.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c25_16']	名字多種，且舉六度十度等，如身行布施名檀、身離諸非名戒、身受所辱名忍、身勤前行名進、身能安靜名禪、身了體空名慧、身行其巧名方便、身立盟誓名願、身利及於他名力、身出生死名智。	名字多種，且舉六度十度等，如身行布施名檀、身離諸非名戒、身受所辱名忍、身勤前行名進、身能安靜名禪、身了體空名慧、身行其巧名方便、身立盟誓名願、身利及於他名力、身出生死名智。	06b	There are many kinds of names, such as the six perfections, ten perfections, etc. For example, practicing giving with the body is called generosity, refraining from wrongdoing with the body is called morality, enduring insults with the body is called patience, diligently progressing with the body is called vigor, being able to be tranquil with the body is called meditation, understanding the empty nature of the body is called wisdom, skillfully practicing with the body is called skillful means, making vows with the body is called aspiration, benefiting others with the body is called power, and transcending birth and death with the body is called knowledge.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c27_6']	身乃至身行八萬塵沙法門，行者隨受名字，達名無名，名身相空。	身乃至身行八萬塵沙法門，行者隨受名字，達名無名，名身相空。	06b	From the body up to practicing the eighty thousand dust-like dharma gates, the practitioner receives the names accordingly, and realizes that names are nameless, and the characteristics of the body are empty.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c29_8']	推檢性相雖空，而色心諸法宛然，故空不定空、假不定假，非空非假皆真實妙性，名顯中道也。	推檢性相雖空，而色心諸法宛然，故空不定空、假不定假，非空非假皆真實妙性，名顯中道也。	06b	Although the nature and characteristics are investigated and empty, the dharmas of form and mind are still clearly present. Therefore, emptiness is not necessarily empty, and the provisional is not necessarily provisional. Neither emptiness nor the provisional are all the wondrous true nature, which is called revealing the middle way.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0159c29_18']	觀身既然，口意例解。	觀身既然，口意例解。	06b	Just as it is with contemplating the body, so it is with the mouth and mind, which are to be understood by analogy.

['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a01_14']	初、明無觀俱失。	初、明無觀俱失。	06b	First, clarifying the loss of both non-contemplation and togetherness.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a03_2']	身等為境能發其觀，觀成境現事理雙明，猪揩金山方之可解。	身等為境能發其觀，觀成境現事理雙明，猪揩金山方之可解。	06b	Taking the body, etc. as objects, one can give rise to contemplation. When contemplation is accomplished, the objects manifest, and principle and phenomena are both illuminated, which can be understood by the analogy of a pig rubbing against a golden mountain.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a03_10']	二、以衣物為例。	二、以衣物為例。	06b	Second, using clothing as an example.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a04_6']	三衣者，僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會也。	三衣者，僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會也。	06b	The three robes are the saṃghāṭī, uttarāsaṅga, and antarvāsa.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a05_2']	六物者，兼尼師壇、鉢多羅、漉水囊也。	六物者，兼尼師壇、鉢多羅、漉水囊也。	06b	The six items also include the niṣidaka, pātra, and water strainer.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a05_9']	是知六外無三。	是知六外無三。	06b	This shows that outside of the six, there are no three.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a06_1']	亦如四禪八定，定外無禪。	亦如四禪八定，定外無禪。	06b	It is also like the four dhyānas and eight concentrations, where there are no dhyānas outside of concentration.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a06_12']	蓋衣名則局、物名稍通。	蓋衣名則局、物名稍通。	06b	The names of the robes are specific, while the names of the items are more general.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a07_14']	衣者遮覆之義也，鉢多羅等且非遮覆，故通名物也。	衣者遮覆之義也，鉢多羅等且非遮覆，故通名物也。	06b	Robes are for covering and concealing, while the pātra, etc. are not for covering and concealing, so they are collectively called items.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a09_3']	亦如無色四處受想慮亡，則無支林喜樂之名，故通受定名也。	亦如無色四處受想慮亡，則無支林喜樂之名，故通受定名也。	06b	It is also like the four formless realms, where the name of joy and bliss of the branches is absent when conceptualization and ideation are gone, so they are collectively called concentrations.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a10_3']	色界四處雖通靜慮，受想尚行則別受禪名。	色界四處雖通靜慮，受想尚行則別受禪名。	06b	Although the four realms of form are also called dhyānas, when conceptualization and ideation are still present, they are separately called dhyānas.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a11_6']	故知解之則事三理六俱明，昧之則三六四八俱暗。	故知解之則事三理六俱明，昧之則三六四八俱暗。	06b	Therefore, it should be known that if one understands, then both the three and the six are clear, but if one is confused, then both the three and the six are obscure.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a11_13']	三、得理俱成。	三、得理俱成。	06b	Third, the attainment of principle is accomplished together.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a13_4']	境由觀顯，理觀若成，身口意三名妙色心，故亦名六觀、亦名事理成也。	境由觀顯，理觀若成，身口意三名妙色心，故亦名六觀、亦名事理成也。	06b	The realm is manifested by contemplation. If the contemplation of principle is accomplished, the three of body, speech, and mind are called wondrous form and mind. Therefore, they are also called the six contemplations, and they are also called the accomplishment of phenomena and principle.
['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a14_3']	無六亦無三者，牒上例中若不解之文也。	無六亦無三者，牒上例中若不解之文也。	06b	Without six and also without three refers to the text in the above example that says if one does not understand.

['ZH_T39_1786_06b:0160a19_6']	予雖不敏，忝久親講授，遂纂集舊聞繫諸卷末。	予雖不敏，忝久親講授，遂纂集舊聞繫諸卷末。	06b	Although I am not intelligent, I have been fortunate to study and teach for a long time, so I have compiled the old teachings and attached them to the end of the scroll.
