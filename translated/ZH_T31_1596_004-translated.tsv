['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b15_1']	如夢唯是識者，覺時何故不如是轉？	如夢唯是識者，覺時何故不如是轉？	If in a dream it is only consciousness, why does one not turn away from it in the waking state?
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b16_8']	實智覺者亦如是轉，如正夢時此覺不生，若夢覺已此智即生。	實智覺者亦如是轉，如正夢時此覺不生，若夢覺已此智即生。	The realization of true wisdom is also like this. Just as this realization does not arise during a dream, if one awakens from the dream this wisdom arises.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b17_14']	如是未得真實智覺此智不生，若得真實智覺此智即生。	如是未得真實智覺此智不生，若得真實智覺此智即生。	Thus, without attaining true wisdom and enlightenment, this wisdom does not arise. If one attains true wisdom and enlightenment, this wisdom arises.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b18_13']	若未有真實智覺，云何於唯識得起比知？	若未有真實智覺，云何於唯識得起比知？	If there is no true wisdom and enlightenment yet, how can one give rise to inferential knowledge of consciousness-only?

['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b24_10']	若三昧境像不異定心，云何彼心還取彼心？	若三昧境像不異定心，云何彼心還取彼心？	If the images of the objects of samādhi are not different from the concentrated mind, how can that mind still grasp that mind?
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b24_13']	彌勒！	彌勒！	Maitreya!
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b25_16']	無有一法能取餘法，然彼心即如是生亦如是顯現。	無有一法能取餘法，然彼心即如是生亦如是顯現。	There is not a single dharma that can grasp another dharma, yet the mind arises in this way and appears in this way.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b26_18']	譬如因面見影，言我見影，謂所見影異於自面。	譬如因面見影，言我見影，謂所見影異於自面。	It is like seeing a reflection due to a face, saying I see a reflection, referring to the seen reflection as different from one's own face.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b27_19']	彼心亦爾，如是生起，即於彼心謂有別物可見。	彼心亦爾，如是生起，即於彼心謂有別物可見。	The mind is also like this, arising in this way, and within that mind, there is something else that can be seen.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b28_11']	由此阿含及道理故得顯現。	由此阿含及道理故得顯現。	Because of this scripture and reasoning, it becomes evident.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285b28_14']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c01_4']	此唯有識者，如《十地經》及《解節經》所說故，此攀緣唯識所顯故。	此唯有識者，如《十地經》及《解節經》所說故，此攀緣唯識所顯故。	This is only consciousness, as stated in the Daśabhūmika-sūtra and the Saṃgīti-sūtra, because this object is manifested by consciousness alone.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c02_4']	我說唯識者，此所攀緣唯識所顯，此有何義？	我說唯識者，此所攀緣唯識所顯，此有何義？	As for I say it is only consciousness, this object is manifested by consciousness alone. What does this mean?
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c03_15']	為顯唯識離義故，由是識所攝故，佛言我說為識顯彼三昧境界是識故。	為顯唯識離義故，由是識所攝故，佛言我說為識顯彼三昧境界是識故。	In order to show that only consciousness is free from objects, because it is included within consciousness, the Buddha said that I say it is consciousness in order to manifest the object of that samādhi as consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c04_12']	然如是生起者，為彼相類而生故。	然如是生起者，為彼相類而生故。	However, it arises in this way because it arises in the form of those appearances.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c05_11']	於中取為別義者，於中謂於三昧境界中。	於中取為別義者，於中謂於三昧境界中。	Among them, taking as a separate meaning means among the objects of samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c06_11']	取為別義者，於彼識影謂有別物為所取體故。	取為別義者，於彼識影謂有別物為所取體故。	Taking as a separate meaning means that in those consciousnesses, the reflections are taken as the substance of the object to be grasped, thinking there is a separate thing.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c07_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c08_10']	如是於靜心中，若見青等爾焰影像，即見自心，無別青等義。	如是於靜心中，若見青等爾焰影像，即見自心，無別青等義。	Thus, in a still mind, if one sees the images of blue and so forth, one sees one's own mind, not separate meanings such as blue.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c09_11']	由此道理，菩薩於一切識中應須比知唯是識量。	由此道理，菩薩於一切識中應須比知唯是識量。	By this principle, bodhisattvas should infer that all consciousnesses are only the measure of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c10_12']	又此青等非憶持識，以所見境界現前住故。	又此青等非憶持識，以所見境界現前住故。	Moreover, this blue and so forth is not a consciousness that remembers, because the seen object abides right before one.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c11_17']	於聞思中所有憶持識，攀緣過去但是彼影，故成唯識。	於聞思中所有憶持識，攀緣過去但是彼影，故成唯識。	The consciousness that remembers what was heard and contemplated in the past only takes the past as its object, and is therefore only the image of that, thus establishing consciousness only.
['ZH_T31_1596_004:0285c12_19']	以此比量，雖未得真如智覺，於唯識中則得比知。	以此比量，雖未得真如智覺，於唯識中則得比知。	By this inference, although one has not yet attained the wisdom of suchness, one can infer that it is only consciousness.
