Thus, we know that this way is both extremely close and extremely distant. Those who realize this way are both utterly still and yet vibrant.

Because it is bottomless, there is nothing it does not exhaust; because it is boundless, there is nothing it does not encompass. It unifies the divisions of the various scriptures and returns the myriad streams to a single flavor. It opens the most impartial intention of the Buddha and harmonizes the different disputes of the hundred schools. It causes the agitated beings of the four forms of birth to all return to the true nature of non-duality, and those who have been long asleep in dreams to all attain the ultimate fruit of great enlightenment.

Those who commit grave offenses will believe in this sutra and be able to extinguish their burning; those with good seeds will rely on this teaching and be reborn.
['ZH_T38_1769_001:0239b10_3']	所言大般涅槃經者，若也具存西域之音，應謂摩訶般涅槃那，此土譯之言大滅度。	所言大般涅槃經者，若也具存西域之音，應謂摩訶般涅槃那，此土譯之言大滅度。	001	As for the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, if we were to preserve the sound of the Western Regions, it should be called Mahaparinirvana. Translated into this land, it means great extinction.

Bodhisattvas penetrate the characteristics of the six consciousnesses, but have not yet realized the origin of the one mind, so it is said that they see the end but not the beginning.
