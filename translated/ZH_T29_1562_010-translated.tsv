['ZH_T29_1562_010:0383c29_7']	謂所依事依體而說，若能依事依處而說。	謂所依事依體而說，若能依事依處而說。	That is to say, the supported things are explained based on substance, while the supporting things are explained based on basis.
['ZH_T29_1562_010:0384a01_7']	或唯依體亦無有失，由此中說定俱生故。	或唯依體亦無有失，由此中說定俱生故。	Or, it is also without fault if it is only based on substance, because it is explained here that they definitely arise together.
['ZH_T29_1562_010:0384a02_6']	形色等體非決定有，光明等中則無有故。	形色等體非決定有，光明等中則無有故。	The substance of shape and color does not definitely exist, because it does not exist in light and so on.

['ZH_T29_1562_010:0384a06_14']	別說大種，此謗皆除。	別說大種，此謗皆除。	The separate explanation of the great elements eliminates all these slanders.
['ZH_T29_1562_010:0384a08_3']	若言大種各各別生造色果故應成多者，其理不然，約類說故。	若言大種各各別生造色果故應成多者，其理不然，約類說故。	If it is said that because derivative form arises as the effect of each of the great elements, it should be many, that reasoning is not so, because it is said in terms of types.
['ZH_T29_1562_010:0384a08_12']	已說有色決定俱生。	已說有色決定俱生。	The definite simultaneous arising of form has already been explained.

['ZH_T29_1562_010:0384a15_15']	或言顯此不遍諸行。	或言顯此不遍諸行。	The word “or” indicates that this attainment is not universal with respect to all conditioned factors.
