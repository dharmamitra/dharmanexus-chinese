That tree is always suitable, and when a sprout grows from the root, the tree immediately dies. The bamboo and reed also die after bearing fruit.

Accepting people's offerings of faith, eating from five hundred cauldrons of food every day, calling himself brave and able to fight with the enemy of afflictions, he instead invites disaster and misfortune. Therefore it is said, the warrior loses himself through greed.

If he had not attained spiritual powers, his offenses would not be worth mentioning. Since he greedily sought offerings, he did not reach the ultimate. Therefore it is said, Thus, greed has no benefit.
['ZH_T04_0212_015:0688c20_14']	當知從癡生者，皆是凡夫人志不堅固，或從正入邪不自覺知，設得信施快自喜慶，不慮後緣當受其報，是故說，當知從癡生也。	當知從癡生者，皆是凡夫人志不堅固，或從正入邪不自覺知，設得信施快自喜慶，不慮後緣當受其報，是故說，當知從癡生也。	As for Should be known to arise from delusion, this refers to all ordinary beings whose resolve is not firm, who may turn from right to wrong without being aware of it. If they obtain offerings of faith, they are delighted and do not consider the future consequences they will have to undergo. Therefore it is said, Should be known to arise from delusion.
['ZH_T04_0212_015:0688c22_10']	愚為此害賢者，諸善之法皆是賢人所習，非是愚者所學，是故說，愚為此害賢也。	愚為此害賢者，諸善之法皆是賢人所習，非是愚者所學，是故說，愚為此害賢也。	As for The foolish are harmed by this, while the wise are divided into different positions, all wholesome dharmas are practiced by the wise, not studied by the foolish.

Internally they give rise to jealousy and externally they hope for offerings, wanting the fourfold assembly to pay respects in a timely manner. Therefore, it is said, foolish people greedily seek offerings and benefits.
