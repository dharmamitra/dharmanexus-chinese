['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208b23_8']	來意有三：	來意有三：	02b	There are three intentions:
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208b24_8']	一、前〈壽量品〉總說菩提、涅槃二果，未能別知。	一、前〈壽量品〉總說菩提、涅槃二果，未能別知。	02b	First, the previous chapter on life span generally discusses the two fruits of enlightenment and nirvana, but one is not yet able to know them separately.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208b25_11']	〈壽量品〉內已為別說涅槃斷果，未為分別菩提智果。	〈壽量品〉內已為別說涅槃斷果，未為分別菩提智果。	02b	In the chapter on life span, the fruit of cessation of nirvana has already been explained separately, but the fruit of the wisdom of enlightenment has not yet been distinguished.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208b27_4']	今為分別三身不同，令差別解障治有別，修因而證，故虛空藏白世尊言：	今為分別三身不同，令差別解障治有別，修因而證，故虛空藏白世尊言：	02b	Now, in order to distinguish the three bodies as being different, to make the understanding of the differences in obstacles and antidotes be different, and to cultivate the causes and realize them, therefore, Akasagarbha addressed the World-Honored One, saying:
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208b28_3']	「云何菩薩於諸如來甚深祕密如法修行？	「云何菩薩於諸如來甚深祕密如法修行？	02b	How do bodhisattvas practice in accordance with the profound and secret teachings of the Tathāgatas?
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208b29_7']	」甚深祕密即三身果，如法修行即障治因，故此品來。	」甚深祕密即三身果，如法修行即障治因，故此品來。	02b	The profound and secret refers to the fruit of the three bodies, and practicing in accordance with the teachings refers to the causes of obstacles and antidotes. Therefore, this chapter comes.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c03_1']	第二來意，前品明其圓寂必因斷障而證，斷所斷已必智慧圓，故無性《攝論》彼〈果智分〉云「由斷所斷，獲得無垢無罣礙智故。	第二來意，前品明其圓寂必因斷障而證，斷所斷已必智慧圓，故無性《攝論》彼〈果智分〉云「由斷所斷，獲得無垢無罣礙智故。	02b	Second, the reason for the chapter: the previous chapter clarifies that the attainment of nirvana must be due to the elimination of hindrances, and after eliminating what is to be eliminated, wisdom must be perfected. Therefore, the Resultant Wisdom Section of the Compendium of the Great Vehicle Treatise states: By eliminating what is to be eliminated, one attains the wisdom that is free from defilements and unobstructed.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c03_14']	斷殊勝無間，次說果智殊勝。	斷殊勝無間，次說果智殊勝。	02b	The excellence of elimination is immediately followed by the excellence of resultant wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c04_3']	」故前品後有此品生。	」故前品後有此品生。	02b	Therefore, this chapter arises after the previous chapter.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c05_2']	第三來意，為機宜聞，慈悲為說令獲利樂。	第三來意，為機宜聞，慈悲為說令獲利樂。	02b	Third, the reason for the chapter: for those whose faculties are ready to hear, out of compassion one explains to them, enabling them to attain benefit and joy.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c07_8']	此品末云「諸佛如來四威儀中無非智攝，一切諸法無有不為慈悲所攝，無有不為利益安樂諸眾生者。	此品末云「諸佛如來四威儀中無非智攝，一切諸法無有不為慈悲所攝，無有不為利益安樂諸眾生者。	02b	The end of this chapter states: The four modes of deportment of all Buddha-Tathāgatas are not apart from wisdom. All dharmas are not apart from being embraced by compassion. There are none that do not bring benefit and joy to sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c09_3']	」即是為除八難等苦，故下文云「聽聞信解、不墮地獄、餓鬼、傍生、阿修羅道。	」即是為除八難等苦，故下文云「聽聞信解、不墮地獄、餓鬼、傍生、阿修羅道。	02b	This is precisely for the elimination of the suffering of the eight difficulties, etc. Therefore, the text below states: Listening, believing, and understanding will prevent one from falling into the paths of hell, hungry ghosts, animals, and asuras.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c09_11']	」此離四惡道難。	」此離四惡道難。	02b	This is the avoidance of the difficulty of the four evil destinies.

['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c10_12']	不生下賤，離生盲聾難。	不生下賤，離生盲聾難。	02b	Not born in low-caste families, free from the difficulty of being born blind or deaf.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c13_4']	恒得親近諸佛如來離佛前佛後難，聽受正法離世智辨聰難，常生諸佛清淨國土離長壽諸天難，乃至國土四種利益等皆為利安，故此品來。	恒得親近諸佛如來離佛前佛後難，聽受正法離世智辨聰難，常生諸佛清淨國土離長壽諸天難，乃至國土四種利益等皆為利安，故此品來。	02b	Constantly able to draw near to the buddhas and tathāgatas, free from the difficulty of being born after the Buddha has passed into extinction, listening to and receiving the true Dharma, free from the difficulty of being born with worldly wisdom and eloquence, always being born in the pure lands of the buddhas, free from the difficulty of being born as a long-lived god, up to the four kinds of benefits in the lands, all for the sake of benefiting and comforting, thus this chapter appears.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c13_10']	二、釋名者。	二、釋名者。	02b	Second, explaining the name.

The Liang lun says: The continuity of the buddhas of the three times is no different. According to their respective natures, the Dharma body generally takes the three meanings of essence as its basis and is called a body.

['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c22_17']	既言分別三身，即分別是能分別，三身是所分別。	既言分別三身，即分別是能分別，三身是所分別。	02b	Since it says distinguishing the three bodies, then distinguishing is the agent of distinguishing, and the three bodies are the objects of distinguishing.

['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c26_4']	此之三身為俱本有？	此之三身為俱本有？	02b	Do these three bodies all originally exist?
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c26_9']	為俱新起？	為俱新起？	02b	Are they all newly arisen?

['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c27_2']	據因俱本有，談果竝新成。	據因俱本有，談果竝新成。	02b	Based on the causes, both the fundamental and the newly arisen are discussed.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c27_16']	以自性身非生滅故，總云新成。	以自性身非生滅故，總云新成。	02b	Because the essential body is neither arising nor ceasing, it is generally said to be newly arisen.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0208c29_12']	自性法身體即真如，在纏名藏未名法身，恒沙萬德相未現故，非功德法之所依；	自性法身體即真如，在纏名藏未名法身，恒沙萬德相未現故，非功德法之所依；	02b	The essence of the Dharma body is true suchness. In the state of entrapment, it is called the tathāgatagarbha and not yet the Dharma body, because the characteristics of the myriad qualities of the sands of the Ganges have not yet manifested and it is not yet the basis of meritorious dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a02_1']	出纏之位即名法身，恒沙萬德相已現顯，說功德依名為法身。	出纏之位即名法身，恒沙萬德相已現顯，說功德依名為法身。	02b	In the state of being free from entrapment, it is called the Dharma body, because the characteristics of the myriad qualities of the sands of the Ganges have already manifested and it is said to be the basis of meritorious qualities, which is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a02_22']	故《勝鬘經》云「在纏名如來藏，出纏名法身。	故《勝鬘經》云「在纏名如來藏，出纏名法身。	02b	Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says, In the state of entrapment, it is called the tathāgatagarbha; free from entrapment, it is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a03_17']	」《成唯識論》云「在大牟尼名法身故」。	」《成唯識論》云「在大牟尼名法身故」。	02b	The Cheng weishi lun says, In the great sage, it is called the Dharma body.

['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a05_10']	應化二身因雖本有，果即新生。	應化二身因雖本有，果即新生。	02b	Although the causes of the two bodies of response and transformation are originally existent, their effects are newly arisen.

['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a07_8']	因體各別。	因體各別。	02b	Their causes and essence are each distinct.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a08_6']	自性法身即應得因得，應得因體即真如是。	自性法身即應得因得，應得因體即真如是。	02b	The essential Dharma body is attained through the cause of realization, and the essence of the cause of realization is suchness.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a09_18']	應化二身即加行因、圓滿因得，發心名加行、修足名圓滿，即六度是。	應化二身即加行因、圓滿因得，發心名加行、修足名圓滿，即六度是。	02b	The two bodies of response and transformation are attained through the cause of added effort and the cause of fulfillment. Generating the aspiration for enlightenment is called added effort, and perfecting the practice is called fulfillment, which are the six pāramitās.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a09_21']	三問：	三問：	02b	Three questions:
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a11_5']	若三因別體亦有別，云何下文云「雖有三數而無三體」。	若三因別體亦有別，云何下文云「雖有三數而無三體」。	02b	If the three causes are distinct in essence, are they also distinct in substance? How is it that the text below says Although there are three enumerations, there are not three substances?
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a11_7']	答：	答：	02b	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a11_22']	約性相說，真如是性，餘者是相。	約性相說，真如是性，餘者是相。	02b	From the perspective of nature and characteristics, suchness is the nature, and the others are characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a12_17']	非有一法出真如界別有體性，云無三體。	非有一法出真如界別有體性，云無三體。	02b	There is no single dharma that emerges from the realm of suchness and has a separate substance, so it is said there are not three substances.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a13_7']	非不離如體性不別。	非不離如體性不別。	02b	It is not that the substance is not separate from suchness.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a13_19']	又約攝相歸性，如體即一；	又約攝相歸性，如體即一；	02b	Moreover, from the perspective of subsuming characteristics and returning to the nature, the substance of suchness is precisely one;
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a14_10']	若相用別論，三體不同。	若相用別論，三體不同。	02b	If characteristics and functions are discussed separately, the three substances are not the same.

['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a22_1']	故下經云「非謂無心，忘想既滅是覺清淨，非謂無覺。	故下經云「非謂無心，忘想既滅是覺清淨，非謂無覺。	02b	Therefore, the sutra below says, It is not that there is no mind, for when deluded thoughts are extinguished, this is the purity of enlightenment. It is not that there is no enlightenment.
['ZH_T39_1788_02b:0209a22_16']	」金水及空本有無變，故喻自性。	」金水及空本有無變，故喻自性。	02b	Gold, water, and space originally exist without change, so they are used as analogies for the essence.
