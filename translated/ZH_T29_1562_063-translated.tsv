Thus far, the doctrines upheld by the elders have been refuted, and only the view of eight minds being called the realization of the truths is upheld.

['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687b17_4']	即無漏慧并餘相應同一所緣，名緣現觀，是即由見等心心所法同能取所緣四諦境義。	即無漏慧并餘相應同一所緣，名緣現觀，是即由見等心心所法同能取所緣四諦境義。	Pure wisdom together with the associated [dharmas] having the same object is called the realization of conditions, which is precisely by the mind and mental factors such as seeing, all being able to take the objects of the four truths as their objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687b19_15']	即諸能緣并餘俱有同一事業，名事現觀，是即由見等心心所法，并餘俱有戒及生相等，於諸諦中同所作義。	即諸能緣并餘俱有同一事業，名事現觀，是即由見等心心所法，并餘俱有戒及生相等，於諸諦中同所作義。	The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687b21_4', 'ZH_T29_1562_063:0687b23_2']	戒生相等是現觀因，於現觀中彼有事用，故亦於彼立現觀名。🔽如是應知，非相應法唯一現觀，除慧所餘心心所法有二現觀，唯無漏慧具足有三。	戒生相等是現觀因，於現觀中彼有事用，故亦於彼立現觀名。 如是應知，非相應法唯一現觀，除慧所餘心心所法有二現觀，唯無漏慧具足有三。	The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.🔽The seeing part and the other parts are the same in their activity of realizing the four truths.

['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687b28_16']	謂初觀見苦聖諦時，盡煩惱故即名斷集，得擇滅故即名證滅，起對治故即名修道。	謂初觀見苦聖諦時，盡煩惱故即名斷集，得擇滅故即名證滅，起對治故即名修道。	That is, when one first contemplates and sees the noble truth of suffering, one is said to have eliminated the cause of suffering because one has exhausted the passions, one is said to have realized cessation because one has attained cessation through discernment, and one is said to have cultivated the path because one has produced the antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c01_5']	以見苦位於集等三，有斷、證、修事現觀故，約事現觀名頓無失。	以見苦位於集等三，有斷、證、修事現觀故，約事現觀名頓無失。	Because the contemplation of suffering has the function of eliminating, realizing, and cultivating with regard to the other three truths, it is not incorrect to speak of a single sudden contemplation in terms of the function of contemplation.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c02_16']	若言依見應撥言非，此現觀必漸，諸諦相別故，一見理無多行相故。	若言依見應撥言非，此現觀必漸，諸諦相別故，一見理無多行相故。	If it is said that this must be gradual because it is based on seeing, since the aspects of the four truths are different, and one principle of seeing cannot have many aspects, this is not so.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c03_14']	隨彼自相一一諦中，世尊說言各各見故。	隨彼自相一一諦中，世尊說言各各見故。	Because the World Honored One said that each truth is seen according to its own characteristics.

['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c04_4']	正見云何？	正見云何？	What is right view?
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c07_1']	謂聖出世無漏無取，廣說乃至，諸聖弟子以苦行相思惟於苦，以集行相思惟於集，以滅行相思惟於滅，以道行相思惟於道。	謂聖出世無漏無取，廣說乃至，諸聖弟子以苦行相思惟於苦，以集行相思惟於集，以滅行相思惟於滅，以道行相思惟於道。	It is the noble, supramundane, uncontaminated, unattached, etc., up to the noble disciples contemplating suffering with the aspect of suffering, contemplating the cause with the aspect of cause, contemplating cessation with the aspect of cessation, and contemplating the path with the aspect of path.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c09_7']	無漏作意相應擇法，一見理無非一行相，故必無有別相諦中隨其自相俱時見理，由此定應許漸現觀。	無漏作意相應擇法，一見理無非一行相，故必無有別相諦中隨其自相俱時見理，由此定應許漸現觀。	The discernment of dharmas associated with pure attention has only one aspect, that of seeing the truth, and no other. Therefore one definitely cannot see the truth in the other aspects of the four truths. Consequently, one must admit that there is a gradual realization of the truths.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c10_16']	若謂以一無我行相頓觀四諦，理必不然，此不應名無漏慧故。	若謂以一無我行相頓觀四諦，理必不然，此不應名無漏慧故。	If you claim that one suddenly realizes the four truths with the one aspect of nonself, this is not reasonable, because this realization cannot be called pure wisdom.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c13_6']	謂無漏慧於諸諦中，一一別觀方名見諦，異此應說以非我行相思惟苦等，不應說言以苦等行相思惟苦等。	謂無漏慧於諸諦中，一一別觀方名見諦，異此應說以非我行相思惟苦等，不應說言以苦等行相思惟苦等。	That is, if one realizes the truths by separately contemplating each of the truths, this is called seeing the truths. If it were otherwise, one would have to say that one contemplates suffering, etc., with the aspects of nonself, etc., and one could not say that one contemplates suffering, etc., with the aspects of suffering, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c14_5']	又彼應說非我現觀，能治何等迷三諦惑？	又彼應說非我現觀，能治何等迷三諦惑？	Also, they must explain what kind of delusion concerning the three truths is eliminated by the realization of nonself.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c15_15']	非謗集等惑非我觀能治，以二行相都不相違，由此不應名真現觀。	非謗集等惑非我觀能治，以二行相都不相違，由此不應名真現觀。	Delusions that deny the truth of the origination of suffering, etc., are not eliminated by the realization of nonself, because the two aspects of the truths of suffering and origination are not opposed to each other. Consequently, this realization cannot be called true realization.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c16_14']	如迷諦惑別有四門，現觀亦應如彼有別。	如迷諦惑別有四門，現觀亦應如彼有別。	Just as delusions concerning the truths are divided into four classes, realization must also be divided like them.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c18_3']	唯迷苦境有我執生，唯悟此生非我行相能為對治，非頓總緣。	唯迷苦境有我執生，唯悟此生非我行相能為對治，非頓總緣。	Only when one is deluded about the object of suffering does the attachment to a self arise. Only when one realizes that this body is not a self can the aspect of practice that is the antidote arise. It cannot be a sudden, comprehensive contemplation.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c19_16']	若頓總觀諸法非我，如何於諦能別了知愛真有因、滅真寂靜、道真出離？	若頓總觀諸法非我，如何於諦能別了知愛真有因、滅真寂靜、道真出離？	If one suddenly and comprehensively contemplates that all dharmas are not a self, how can one separately understand and know that there is a true cause of love, that cessation is true quiescence, and that the path is true liberation?
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c20_10']	若不了知如是等相，何名見諦？	若不了知如是等相，何名見諦？	If one does not understand these characteristics, how can it be called seeing the truth?
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c21_9']	若觀滅道如苦行相，應名邪智，非如實知。	若觀滅道如苦行相，應名邪智，非如實知。	If one contemplates cessation and the path as one does suffering, it should be called wrong knowledge, not knowledge in accordance with reality.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c22_8']	是故但緣苦為非我可名現觀，非一切緣。	是故但緣苦為非我可名現觀，非一切緣。	Therefore, only contemplating suffering as not a self can be called realization, not all objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c23_8']	又若見苦時斷迷道等惑，修所斷惑何不能斷？	又若見苦時斷迷道等惑，修所斷惑何不能斷？	Moreover, if when one sees suffering one eliminates delusions about the path, etc., why can one not eliminate the delusions eliminated by cultivation?
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c24_7']	若爾，於苦得現觀時，應於一切所作已辦；	若爾，於苦得現觀時，應於一切所作已辦；	If that is so, when one attains realization of suffering, one should have accomplished all that needs to be done;
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c24_17']	既非所許，故理不然。	既非所許，故理不然。	since this is not accepted, the reasoning is not correct.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c28_3']	若謂數修能對治道，方能漸斷修所斷惑，非治頓起可名數修，亦應要由解道等見方能永斷迷道等惑，非解苦時名解道等，如何能斷迷道等惑？	若謂數修能對治道，方能漸斷修所斷惑，非治頓起可名數修，亦應要由解道等見方能永斷迷道等惑，非解苦時名解道等，如何能斷迷道等惑？	If you say that the path of cultivation, cultivated repeatedly, can gradually eliminate the passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation, and that the path of cultivation is not cultivated repeatedly if the path is not generated suddenly, then you must say that one can eliminate the passions that are confused about the path, etc., only by the view that understands the path, etc., and that when one understands suffering, it is not called understanding the path, etc. How then can one eliminate the passions that are confused about the path, etc.?
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0687c29_7']	又由佛說非四諦中總相頓觀成真現觀，故有設難：	又由佛說非四諦中總相頓觀成真現觀，故有設難：	Also, because the Buddha said that one cannot suddenly realize the four noble truths in a general way and achieve true insight, someone has raised the following objection:
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a01_1']	諦應如蘊一時總觀成真現觀。	諦應如蘊一時總觀成真現觀。	The truths must be generally realized all at once, just as one realizes the aggregates, and one must achieve true insight.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a02_4']	若異此者，法相無邊，現觀應無究竟時者唐捐其功。	若異此者，法相無邊，現觀應無究竟時者唐捐其功。	If this is not so, then since the characteristics of dharmas are infinite, the achievement of insight must be without a definite time, and the effort to achieve it is wasted.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a02_15']	如《善授經》佛告長者：	如《善授經》佛告長者：	As the Sutra of Good Counsel says, the Buddha said to the Elder:
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a05_13']	於四聖諦非頓現觀，必漸現觀，廣說乃至，無處無容於苦聖諦未現觀已能現觀集，如是乃至，無處無容於滅聖諦未現觀已能現觀道。	於四聖諦非頓現觀，必漸現觀，廣說乃至，無處無容於苦聖諦未現觀已能現觀集，如是乃至，無處無容於滅聖諦未現觀已能現觀道。	One cannot suddenly realize the four noble truths; one must realize them gradually. Expounding this extensively, there is no possibility that one can realize the truth of the origination of suffering without realizing the truth of suffering. In this way, there is no possibility that one can realize the truth of the path to the cessation of suffering without realizing the truth of the cessation of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a07_3']	如是慶喜及一苾芻，二經所言意皆同此，二經一一各有別喻。	如是慶喜及一苾芻，二經所言意皆同此，二經一一各有別喻。	In the same way, the two scriptures spoken of by Nanda and the bhikṣu each have a separate metaphor.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a09_1']	若言我等不誦此經，理不應然，如向所引分明顯示漸現觀經、頓現觀經不可得故。	若言我等不誦此經，理不應然，如向所引分明顯示漸現觀經、頓現觀經不可得故。	If you say that we do not recite this scripture, this is unreasonable. As previously cited, it clearly shows that the scripture on gradual realization and the scripture on sudden realization cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a11_7']	謂若汝等不誦此經，復無別經分明顯說必頓非漸是汝所誦，可為定量非撥此經，豈無分明說現觀教？	謂若汝等不誦此經，復無別經分明顯說必頓非漸是汝所誦，可為定量非撥此經，豈無分明說現觀教？	If you do not recite this scripture and there is no other scripture that clearly explains that it must be sudden and not gradual, which you recite as a definitive measure, how can you deny this scripture without clear teaching on realization?
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a12_15']	是故汝等應誦此經，此經不違諸餘聖教及法性故，不可非撥。	是故汝等應誦此經，此經不違諸餘聖教及法性故，不可非撥。	Therefore, you should recite this scripture, because this scripture does not contradict the other holy teachings and the nature of dharmas, and so cannot be denied.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a13_20']	又共所誦《轉法輪經》說現觀中別觀四諦，如彼經說：	又共所誦《轉法輪經》說現觀中別觀四諦，如彼經說：	Moreover, the commonly recited Sutra on Turning the Dharma Wheel speaks of separately realizing the four truths in realization, as that sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a15_18']	此苦聖諦是先未聞法，應如理思惟，廣說乃至，此道聖諦是先未聞法，應如理思惟。	此苦聖諦是先未聞法，應如理思惟，廣說乃至，此道聖諦是先未聞法，應如理思惟。	This is the noble truth of suffering that has not been heard before. One should contemplate it with right thought. Expounding in detail up to this is the noble truth of the path that has not been heard before. One should contemplate it with right thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a17_6']	不可判為初修業地，說此無間證等覺故，更不別說現觀位故。	不可判為初修業地，說此無間證等覺故，更不別說現觀位故。	It cannot be determined to be the stage of initial practice, because it is said that immediately after this one realizes supreme enlightenment, and because it does not separately mention the stage of realization.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a18_7']	若判此為初修業地，應言何處說入真現觀時？	若判此為初修業地，應言何處說入真現觀時？	If it is determined to be the stage of initial practice, it should be said: where is it said that when one enters true realization,
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a19_6']	既更無文，此即現觀，故漸現觀不違教理。	既更無文，此即現觀，故漸現觀不違教理。	since there is no further text, this is precisely realization. Therefore gradual realization does not contradict the teachings and principles.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a20_5']	又應詰彼頓現觀宗，執頓現觀依何教理？	又應詰彼頓現觀宗，執頓現觀依何教理？	Moreover, one should question those who uphold the doctrine of sudden realization: based on what teachings and principles do you uphold sudden realization?
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a20_10']	具依教理。	具依教理。	It is fully based on teachings and principles.

['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a21_17']	諸聖弟子入諦現觀故，俱時斷三結。	諸聖弟子入諦現觀故，俱時斷三結。	Because the noble disciples enter realization of the truths, they simultaneously sever the three bonds.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a22_6']	此中不見說漸次言。	此中不見說漸次言。	Here one does not see it said that it is gradual.

['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a23_1']	於觀四諦應知慧根。	於觀四諦應知慧根。	One should know the faculty of wisdom in contemplating the four truths.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a23_15']	此既總說觀四諦言，知頓現觀。	此既總說觀四諦言，知頓現觀。	Since it is said in general that one contemplates the four truths, we know that there is a sudden realization.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a23_20', 'ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a24_13']	又契經說：🔽修非常想斷諸欲貪，乃至廣說。	又契經說： 修非常想斷諸欲貪，乃至廣說。	Also, a scripture says:🔽Cultivating the notion of impermanence cuts off all craving for desires, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a25_11']	非漸現觀，唯非常想能斷一切欲貪等結。	非漸現觀，唯非常想能斷一切欲貪等結。	If realization is gradual, only the notion of impermanence can cut off all craving for desires and so on.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a25_16']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Also, a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a26_10']	若斷一切疑，由知薩因苦。	若斷一切疑，由知薩因苦。	If one cuts off all doubts, it is by knowing the cause of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a27_16']	薩是并義，此經意言遍知有取苦，并遍知苦集，顯頓現觀。	薩是并義，此經意言遍知有取苦，并遍知苦集，顯頓現觀。	The meaning of this scripture is that one universally knows suffering that is grasped, and one universally knows the cause of suffering, which shows that there is a sudden realization.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a28_2']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Also, a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a28_18']	若於苦無疑，於集滅道即亦得無疑。	若於苦無疑，於集滅道即亦得無疑。	If one has no doubt about suffering, then one also attains no doubt about the cause, cessation, and path of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688a29_8']	既頓捨疑，非漸現觀。	既頓捨疑，非漸現觀。	Since one suddenly abandons doubt, realization is not gradual.

['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688b05_4']	又如頓取五種色衣，謂如頓觀五色衣者，總取衣上五種顯色。	又如頓取五種色衣，謂如頓觀五色衣者，總取衣上五種顯色。	Also, it is like suddenly grasping a five-colored robe, meaning that one suddenly observes the five colors in a robe, grasping them as a whole.
['ZH_T29_1562_063:0688b06_3']	如是總以一種行相，頓觀苦等別諦理成。	如是總以一種行相，頓觀苦等別諦理成。	In the same way, one suddenly observes the distinct principles of the separate truths such as suffering as a whole with a single mode of activity.

This means that in the stage of cultivation, one gives rise to the contemplation of suffering and the path, and eliminates the desire bound to the three realms that is to be eliminated by cultivation, as well as agitation, pride, and ignorance.

The cause of suffering that is to be eliminated by the path of insight can be eliminated in this way, but the cause of suffering that is to be eliminated by the knowledge of the cause of suffering is not eliminated in this way, because, apart from the four aspects of cause, etc., one cannot eliminate the truth of the cause of suffering.

This is also so for the path of insight. Why insist on the contrary?

Therefore one may retrogress from the path of cultivation.
