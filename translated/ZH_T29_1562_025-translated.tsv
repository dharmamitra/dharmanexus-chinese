['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c11_18']	或說十一，如智事等經。	或說十一，如智事等經。	025	Sometimes eleven are explained, as in the Sūtra on the Characteristics of Wisdom and so forth.

['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c13_11']	或說有八，如契經言：	或說有八，如契經言：	025	Sometimes eight are explained, as a sūtra says:🔽All śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas who do not understand the nature of dharmas as they truly are...

['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c16_16']	論隨法性，經順化宜，故契經中分別緣起，隨所化者機宜異說。	論隨法性，經順化宜，故契經中分別緣起，隨所化者機宜異說。	025	The treatise follows the nature of dharmas, while the sūtras accord with the inclinations of those to be taught. Therefore, in the sūtras, dependent arising is explained according to the inclinations of those to be taught.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c17_7']	或論了義，經義不了。	或論了義，經義不了。	025	Or, the treatise has definitive meaning, while the meaning of the sūtras is not definitive.

Because they rely on sentient beings, defilement and purity can be accomplished. The Buddha reveals these two only for the sake of sentient beings. The Buddha appears in the world only for this one matter.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c20_16']	故契經中依有情說，為欲成立大義利故分別緣起。	故契經中依有情說，為欲成立大義利故分別緣起。	025	Therefore, in the sūtras, dependent arising is explained in terms of sentient beings. In order to establish the great benefit, dependent arising is explained.

['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c27_4']	十二支者，一無明、二行、三識、四名色、五六處、六觸、七受、八愛、九取、十有、十一生、十二老死。	十二支者，一無明、二行、三識、四名色、五六處、六觸、七受、八愛、九取、十有、十一生、十二老死。	025	The twelve links are: 1. ignorance, 2. karmic formations, 3. consciousness, 4. name-and-form, 5. six sense bases, 6. contact, 7. feeling, 8. craving, 9. grasping, 10. becoming, 11. birth, 12. old age and death.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c28_10']	言三際者，一前際、二後際、三中際，即是過未及現三生。	言三際者，一前際、二後際、三中際，即是過未及現三生。	025	As for the three periods of time, the first is the past, the second is the future, and the third is the present, which are the three lives of the past, future, and present.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0480c29_2']	云何十二支於三際建立？	云何十二支於三際建立？	025	How are the twelve links established in the three periods of time?
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a01_1']	謂前後際各立二支，中際八支，故成十二。	謂前後際各立二支，中際八支，故成十二。	025	It is because two links are established for the past and future, and eight for the present, thus making twelve.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a01_14']	無明、行在前際，謂過去生；	無明、行在前際，謂過去生；	025	Ignorance and karmic formations are in the past, referring to past lives;
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a02_4']	生、老死在後際，謂未來生；	生、老死在後際，謂未來生；	025	Birth and old age and death are in the future, referring to future lives;
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a02_16']	所餘八在中際，謂現在生。	所餘八在中際，謂現在生。	025	The remaining eight are in the present, referring to the present life.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a03_6']	前際二因，所招五果；	前際二因，所招五果；	025	The two causes in the past attract the five fruits;

['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a04_13']	非諸一生皆具此八，據圓滿者說有八支。	非諸一生皆具此八，據圓滿者說有八支。	025	Not all lives are complete with these eight, it is said that there are eight links based on the complete one.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a04_18']	圓滿者何？	圓滿者何？	025	What is the complete one?
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a05_3']	謂支無缺。	謂支無缺。	025	It means that the members are not lacking.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a06_11']	或由圓滿惑業所招，謂先增上惑業所引，此中意說補特伽羅。	或由圓滿惑業所招，謂先增上惑業所引，此中意說補特伽羅。	025	Or it is due to the perfection of the afflictions and karma that are attracted, that is, what is attracted by the superior afflictions and karma in the past. Here, the meaning is to speak of the pudgala.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a08_1']	歷一切位名圓滿者，非諸天中及色無色，羯剌藍等諸位闕故。	歷一切位名圓滿者，非諸天中及色無色，羯剌藍等諸位闕故。	025	Those who go through all stages are called perfect ones, because the stages such as kalala are lacking in the heavens and the formless realms.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a09_15']	世尊但約欲界少分補特伽羅說具十二，如《大緣起契經》中說，佛告阿難：	世尊但約欲界少分補特伽羅說具十二，如《大緣起契經》中說，佛告阿難：	025	The World-Honored One only speaks of the twelve members in relation to a part of the pudgala of the desire realm, as it is said in the Mahāpratītyasamutpāda Sūtra: The Buddha said to Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a10_5']	識若不入胎，得增廣大不？	識若不入胎，得增廣大不？	025	If consciousness does not enter the womb, can it grow and become great?

['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a10_16']	乃至廣說。	乃至廣說。	025	And so on, it is explained in detail.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a13_2']	是故若有補特伽羅，於次前生造無明行，具招現在識等五支，復於現生造愛取有，招次後世生等二支。	是故若有補特伽羅，於次前生造無明行，具招現在識等五支，復於現生造愛取有，招次後世生等二支。	025	Therefore, if there is a pudgala who creates ignorance and karma in the previous life, and fully attracts the five members such as consciousness in the present, and again creates craving, grasping, and becoming in the present life, and attracts the two members such as birth in the next life,
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a13_11']	應知此經依彼而說。	應知此經依彼而說。	025	One should know that this sūtra is spoken in relation to him.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a14_10']	若依一切補特伽羅立諸有支，便成雜亂。	若依一切補特伽羅立諸有支，便成雜亂。	025	If the members of existence are established in relation to all pudgalas, then they become confused.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a16_7']	謂彼或有現在五支，非次前生無明行果，及次後世生老死支，非現在生愛取有果。	謂彼或有現在五支，非次前生無明行果，及次後世生老死支，非現在生愛取有果。	025	That is, they may have the five members of the present, but these are not the results of ignorance and karmic forces that arose immediately before, nor are they the members of birth and old age and death that will arise in the future. Nor are the present members of craving, grasping, and becoming the results of birth in the present.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a17_15']	彼皆非此經意所明勿見果因相去隔絕，便疑因果感起無能。	彼皆非此經意所明勿見果因相去隔絕，便疑因果感起無能。	025	We must not suppose that the meaning of this scripture is that cause and result are separated by a great distance, and that therefore there is no power to attract cause and result.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a19_7']	應知緣起支，略唯二分前後際，如次七支五支，以果與因屬因果故。	應知緣起支，略唯二分前後際，如次七支五支，以果與因屬因果故。	025	We must understand that the members of conditioned arising are in two parts, past and future, and that the seven members and five members are cause and result, respectively, because they are categorized as cause and result.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a20_8']	或因與果五支七支，以因攝因、以果攝果故。	或因與果五支七支，以因攝因、以果攝果故。	025	Or, the five members and seven members are cause and result, because cause is categorized as cause and result is categorized as result.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a22_15']	謂現愛取即過無明，現在有支即過去行，現在世識即未來生，餘現四支即當老死，是名因果二分差別。	謂現愛取即過無明，現在有支即過去行，現在世識即未來生，餘現四支即當老死，是名因果二分差別。	025	That is, present craving and grasping are the same as past ignorance, and the present member of becoming is the same as past karmic forces. Present consciousness is the same as future birth, and the remaining four members of the present are the same as future old age and death. This is called the distinction between cause and result in the two parts.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a23_5']	此緣起言為目何義？	此緣起言為目何義？	025	What is the meaning of the term conditioned arising?
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a25_3']	今見此中差別義者，謂鉢剌底是現前義，壹女界是有義，一字界中有多義故。	今見此中差別義者，謂鉢剌底是現前義，壹女界是有義，一字界中有多義故。	025	Now, seeing the meaning of distinction in this, it means that prāpti is the meaning of present, and asti is the meaning of existence, because there are many meanings in the single syllable.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a27_10']	由先鉢剌底，壹女界成緣，訖埵緣是已義，此合所依變成獵比參是和合義，嗢是上升義，鉢地界是有義。	由先鉢剌底，壹女界成緣，訖埵緣是已義，此合所依變成獵比參是和合義，嗢是上升義，鉢地界是有義。	025	Due to prāpti coming first, asti becomes the condition, and kṛta is the meaning of already. This combination becomes samyoga, which is the meaning of combination. Urdhva is the meaning of rising up, and asti is the meaning of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a28_3']	由以嗢為先，鉢地界成起。	由以嗢為先，鉢地界成起。	025	By taking Urdhva as the first, asti becomes arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481a29_3']	此總義者，緣現已合，有法升起，是緣起義。	此總義者，緣現已合，有法升起，是緣起義。	025	The general meaning is that the present conditions have already combined, and the existent dharma rises up, which is the meaning of dependent arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b01_3']	緣現前言即目和合，復言和合有何別用？	緣現前言即目和合，復言和合有何別用？	025	As for the present conditions mentioned above, it refers to the combination. What is the separate function of saying combination again?
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b02_3']	為成無法唯一緣生，或顯俱生前生緣故。	為成無法唯一緣生，或顯俱生前生緣故。	025	It is to establish that there is only one condition for the arising of non-existent dharmas, or to show the simultaneous and prior conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b03_2']	緣現前者顯俱生緣，緣和合者顯前生緣。	緣現前者顯俱生緣，緣和合者顯前生緣。	025	The present conditions show the simultaneous conditions, and the combination shows the prior conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b04_3']	此則顯成依，此有彼有、此生故彼生，是緣起義。	此則顯成依，此有彼有、此生故彼生，是緣起義。	025	This then shows the establishment of because this exists, that exists; because this arises, that arises, which is the meaning of dependent arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b06_2']	又鉢剌底顯應行義，壹女馱都顯不壞法，參顯正集，此意總顯世出現因說名緣起。	又鉢剌底顯應行義，壹女馱都顯不壞法，參顯正集，此意總顯世出現因說名緣起。	025	Moreover, pratisandhi manifests the meaning of proper practice, utpatti manifests the meaning of indestructible dharmas, sam means manifesting the correct assembly, and this meaning generally manifests the cause of appearance in the world, which is called dependent origination.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b08_1']	謂壹女界，由鉢剌底為先助故，轉變成緣，正集及升為先助故，令鉢地界轉變成起。	謂壹女界，由鉢剌底為先助故，轉變成緣，正集及升為先助故，令鉢地界轉變成起。	025	That is to say, the realm of utpatti, due to pratisandhi as the prior aid, transforms into pratyaya. The correct assembly and ascent as the prior aid cause the realm of prthivī to transform into utpāda.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b08_10']	依如是義立緣起名。	依如是義立緣起名。	025	Based on this meaning, the name dependent origination is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b11_14']	經主此中釋差別義，鉢剌底是至義，醫底界是行義，由先助力界義轉變，故行由至轉變成緣，參是和合義，嗢是上升義，鉢地界是有義。	經主此中釋差別義，鉢剌底是至義，醫底界是行義，由先助力界義轉變，故行由至轉變成緣，參是和合義，嗢是上升義，鉢地界是有義。	025	The author of the treatise explains the meaning of distinction here: pratisandhi is the meaning of arrival, utpatti is the meaning of practice, due to the prior aid, the meaning of the realm transforms, therefore practice transforms into pratyaya due to arrival, sam means the meaning of combination, u means ascending, and the realm of prthivī is the meaning of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b13_4']	有藉合升轉變成起，由此有法至於緣已和合升起，是緣起義。	有藉合升轉變成起，由此有法至於緣已和合升起，是緣起義。	025	Existence relies on combination and ascent to transform into utpāda. Due to this, the dharma of existence arrives at pratyaya, combines, and ascends to arise. This is the meaning of dependent origination.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b13_14']	如是所釋，越彼所宗。	如是所釋，越彼所宗。	025	This explanation goes beyond their school.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b15_3']	且彼有界，由先助力轉變成起，非異有故，再顯有義竟何所成？	且彼有界，由先助力轉變成起，非異有故，再顯有義竟何所成？	025	Moreover, in the case of existence, by the prior assisting power, it transforms and becomes arising. Since it is not different from existence, what is accomplished by again manifesting the meaning of existence?
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b16_2']	以彼所宗無有非起，無起非有一應無義。	以彼所宗無有非起，無起非有一應無義。	025	Because in their doctrine there is no non-arising, and there is no arising that is not existent, there should be no meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b17_1']	經主自立此句義已，復自假興如是徵難：	經主自立此句義已，復自假興如是徵難：	025	The author of the treatise has already established this meaning of the sentence, and then again hypothetically raises such a question:
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b17_11']	如是句義，理不應然。	如是句義，理不應然。	025	This meaning of the sentence is not reasonable.

['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b19_5']	依一作者有二作用，於前作用應有已言，如有一人浴已方食。	依一作者有二作用，於前作用應有已言，如有一人浴已方食。	025	There are two functions based on a single agent. The prior function should have the word already. For example, a single person bathes and then eats.
['ZH_T29_1562_025:0481b20_13']	無少行法有在起前，先至於緣後時方起，非無作者可有作用。	無少行法有在起前，先至於緣後時方起，非無作者可有作用。	025	There is no dharma of slight practice that first reaches the object before arising, and only then arises later. Without an agent, there cannot be a function.

Because they have the same characteristic, it is said that there is conditioned arising, which has already illustrated the meaning of the condition of formations for consciousness, so consciousness is not separately said to have a condition from which it arises.

As will be said later, this condition is for existence. That is to say, the next question is, “What is the condition for existence?” It is again answered, “Up to the birth in the future existence.” The word “existence” indicates the karmic forces that are the object of consciousness.
