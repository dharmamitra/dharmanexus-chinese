['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a02_15']	苾芻當知，持息入者飲吸外風令入身內，持息出者驅擯內風令出身外。	苾芻當知，持息入者飲吸外風令入身內，持息出者驅擯內風令出身外。	Bhikṣus should know, as for holding the breath and inhaling, it is drinking in external wind and causing it to enter the body; as for holding the breath and exhaling, it is driving out internal wind and causing it to leave the body externally.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a03_14']	慧由念力觀此為境，故名阿那阿波那念。	慧由念力觀此為境，故名阿那阿波那念。	Because wisdom observes this as its object by the power of mindfulness, it is called mindfulness of inhalation and exhalation.

This expression indicates that inhalation and exhalation have the meaning of holding. Wisdom obtains this mindfulness by mindfully observing this.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a06_14']	辯屬身風，略有六種：	辯屬身風，略有六種：	As for the winds belonging to the body, there are roughly six kinds:
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a08_2']	一入息風、二出息風、三發語風、四除棄風、五隨轉風、六動身風。	一入息風、二出息風、三發語風、四除棄風、五隨轉風、六動身風。	1. inhalation wind, 2. exhalation wind, 3. speech-producing wind, 4. evacuative wind, 5. circulating wind, 6. moving-body wind.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a10_17']	謂諸有情處胎卵位，先於臍處業生風起，穿身成穴如藕根莖，最初有風來入身內，乘茲口鼻餘風續入，此初及後名入息風。	謂諸有情處胎卵位，先於臍處業生風起，穿身成穴如藕根莖，最初有風來入身內，乘茲口鼻餘風續入，此初及後名入息風。	It is said that for sentient beings in the embryonic or egg stage, a wind produced by karma first arises at the navel, penetrating the body and forming a hole like the stem of a lotus root. Initially, a wind comes and enters the body, and other winds continue to enter through the mouth, nose, and so on. This initial and subsequent wind is called inhalation wind.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a14_4']	此入息風適至身內，有風續出名出息風，如鍛金師開㰆囊口自然風入，風性法爾，但有孔隙必隨入故，入已按之其風還出，入息出息次第亦然。	此入息風適至身內，有風續出名出息風，如鍛金師開㰆囊口自然風入，風性法爾，但有孔隙必隨入故，入已按之其風還出，入息出息次第亦然。	When this in-breath wind arrives at the body, there is a wind that continues to emerge called the out-breath wind. It is like a goldsmith who opens the bellows' mouth and the wind naturally enters. The nature of wind is such that wherever there are openings, it will definitely enter. Having entered, if one presses it, the wind will come out again. The in-breath and out-breath occur in sequence in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a15_12']	理實此風無入無出，但如是轉能損益身，相續道中假名入出。	理實此風無入無出，但如是轉能損益身，相續道中假名入出。	In reality, this wind has no entering or exiting, but it transforms like this and can benefit or harm the body. In the continuity of the path, it is provisionally named entering and exiting.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a17_2']	入息轉位能逐身中腐敗污垢諸臭穢物，增長火界令身輕舉。	入息轉位能逐身中腐敗污垢諸臭穢物，增長火界令身輕舉。	When the in-breath transforms, it can follow the foul and dirty things that decay in the body, increase the fire element, and make the body light and buoyant.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a18_1']	出息轉時能除欝蒸，損減火界令身沈重。	出息轉時能除欝蒸，損減火界令身沈重。	When the out-breath transforms, it can remove stuffiness, reduce the fire element, and make the body heavy and dull.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a20_12']	發語風者，謂有別風是欲為先，展轉所引發語心起所令增盛，生從臍處，流轉衝喉擊異熟生，長養大種引等流性。	發語風者，謂有別風是欲為先，展轉所引發語心起所令增盛，生從臍處，流轉衝喉擊異熟生，長養大種引等流性。	The wind that produces speech is a wind that, with desire as the forerunner, is gradually drawn out. It causes the mind that arises from speech to increase and grow. It originates from the navel, circulates, and strikes the throat, causing the ripening of the great elements that are nurtured to produce the nature of the outflow.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a23_4']	風大種生鼓動齒脣舌腭差別，由此勢力引起未來顯名句文造色自性，此居口內名語亦業，流出外時但名為語。	風大種生鼓動齒脣舌腭差別，由此勢力引起未來顯名句文造色自性，此居口內名語亦業，流出外時但名為語。	The great element wind is born and moves the teeth, lips, tongue, and palate, and by the power of this wind, future visible form, name, phrase, and syllable are produced. This wind is in the mouth and is called speech and action. When it flows out, it is only called speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a23_14']	心生大種，其理極成。	心生大種，其理極成。	The mind and the great elements are completely established.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a24_12']	謂見貪瞋癡心起者，面有潤慘亂色異常。	謂見貪瞋癡心起者，面有潤慘亂色異常。	This is because when one sees a mind of greed, anger, or delusion arise, the face has a moist, sullen, or disturbed color that is not normal.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a26_2']	又亦傳聞懷瞋毒者，面門生焰非有慈心，貪引火生焚身等故。	又亦傳聞懷瞋毒者，面門生焰非有慈心，貪引火生焚身等故。	Also, it is heard that one who harbors anger and poison has flames born from the mouth, and one who has a compassionate mind does not. Greed attracts the birth of fire and burns the body, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a28_17']	除棄風者，謂有別風，隨便路行能蠲二穢，由穢內逼有苦受生，由苦受生發除棄欲，由除棄欲引起風心，此心起風成除棄業。	除棄風者，謂有別風，隨便路行能蠲二穢，由穢內逼有苦受生，由苦受生發除棄欲，由除棄欲引起風心，此心起風成除棄業。	The wind that removes is the wind that moves along the path and is able to remove the two impurities. Because the impurities press internally, there is the arising of painful feeling. Because painful feeling arises, the desire to remove it is aroused. Because of the desire to remove it, the mind that moves the wind is aroused. This mind produces the wind that accomplishes the action of removing.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673a29_7']	又此風力令身安隱。	又此風力令身安隱。	Also, the power of this wind makes the body peaceful and secure.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b01_15']	隨轉風者，謂有別風遍隨身支諸毛孔轉，由此故得隨轉風名。	隨轉風者，謂有別風遍隨身支諸毛孔轉，由此故得隨轉風名。	The circulating wind refers to a separate wind that circulates through the body's limbs and pores, and for this reason it is called the circulating wind.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b03_12']	此不依心但依業力，隨身孔隙自然流行，由此能除依孔隙住腐敗污垢諸臭穢物。	此不依心但依業力，隨身孔隙自然流行，由此能除依孔隙住腐敗污垢諸臭穢物。	This wind does not depend on the mind but only on the power of karma. It naturally flows through the body's openings, and for this reason it can remove putrid, dirty, and foul-smelling substances that reside in the body's openings.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b05_12']	動身風者，謂有別風能擊動身引起表業，應知此起以心為因，遍諸身支能為擊動。	動身風者，謂有別風能擊動身引起表業，應知此起以心為因，遍諸身支能為擊動。	The moving body wind refers to a separate wind that can strike and move the body, giving rise to manifest karma. You should know that this wind arises with the mind as its cause, and it pervades the body's limbs and can cause them to move.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b07_1']	因顯風義乘辯六風，然於此中正明二息，此中意辯持息念故。	因顯風義乘辯六風，然於此中正明二息，此中意辯持息念故。	The meaning of the wind revealed by the six winds is discussed here. However, in this context, the two breaths are explained, because the intention here is to discuss mindfulness of the breath.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b07_19']	此念自性是慧非餘，以契經說了知言故。	此念自性是慧非餘，以契經說了知言故。	The intrinsic nature of this mindfulness is wisdom, not something else, because the sutras say it is understanding.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b09_1']	此品念勝故得念名，由念力記持，入出息量故。	此品念勝故得念名，由念力記持，入出息量故。	This mindfulness is superior in this stage, and therefore it is called mindfulness. It is because of the power of mindfulness that one can remember the length of the inhalation and exhalation.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b09_20']	為顯緣息定慧得成，由念功能，故說為念。	為顯緣息定慧得成，由念功能，故說為念。	In order to reveal that concentration and wisdom are accomplished by relying on the breath, and because of the function of mindfulness, it is said to be mindfulness.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b10_9']	并隨行性，應准前門。	并隨行性，應准前門。	and the nature of the associated dharmas should be understood in the same way as in the previous section.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b12_15']	此念所依唯通五地，謂依欲界、靜慮中間及初二三靜慮近分，由此但與捨根相應，為對治尋修此念故。	此念所依唯通五地，謂依欲界、靜慮中間及初二三靜慮近分，由此但與捨根相應，為對治尋修此念故。	The basis of this mindfulness is only the five stages, namely, the desire realm, the intermediate state of meditation, and the access concentrations to the first, second, and third meditations. It is only associated with the faculty of indifference, because it is cultivated in order to counteract applied thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b14_4']	樂苦等受能順引發親里等尋，故對治尋，要任運受現在前位。	樂苦等受能順引發親里等尋，故對治尋，要任運受現在前位。	Because the feelings of pleasure, suffering, etc., can induce and produce applied thought concerning relatives, etc., therefore in order to counteract applied thought, it is necessary to be in a state in which one experiences spontaneous feelings.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b14_18']	若爾，何故辯息念中言覺喜樂？	若爾，何故辯息念中言覺喜樂？	If this is so, why does the explanation of mindfulness of breathing say that one experiences joy and pleasure?
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b16_2']	此亦無過，以諸勤修持息念位，中間有彼無色相生。	此亦無過，以諸勤修持息念位，中間有彼無色相生。	This also is not a mistake, because in the state of cultivating mindfulness of breathing, there is the appearance of those formless [concentrations].
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b18_8']	諸瑜伽師雖覺彼相，於持息念不名乖越，約此密說覺喜樂言，不可由斯執持息念亦容得與餘受相應。	諸瑜伽師雖覺彼相，於持息念不名乖越，約此密說覺喜樂言，不可由斯執持息念亦容得與餘受相應。	Even though the yoga masters experience those characteristics, they are not said to be in error with regard to mindfulness of breathing. This is said in a veiled way, referring to the experience of joy and pleasure. One cannot conclude from this that mindfulness of breathing may also be associated with other feelings.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b19_15']	理實此中亦覺餘法，以身念住加行位中亦說觀於多六法故。	理實此中亦覺餘法，以身念住加行位中亦說觀於多六法故。	In reality, one also experiences other dharmas in this, because in the state of added effort of the foundations of mindfulness, one also contemplates the many dharmas of the six elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b21_5']	謂若諸法隨屬於身，於彼法相如理觀察，亦名於身住循身觀。	謂若諸法隨屬於身，於彼法相如理觀察，亦名於身住循身觀。	That is, if dharmas are associated with the body, one contemplates their characteristics in accordance with principle, and this is called “dwelling in contemplation of the body in regard to the body.”
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b22_13']	或彼行者轉緣風覺，暫時觀察喜受樂受，是故說言覺喜覺樂。	或彼行者轉緣風覺，暫時觀察喜受樂受，是故說言覺喜覺樂。	Or, the practitioner turns to the perception of wind and temporarily contemplates the feeling of joy and the feeling of pleasure. Therefore, it is said that he is aware of joy and aware of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b23_11']	由此故說諸聖弟子爾時於受住循受觀。	由此故說諸聖弟子爾時於受住循受觀。	For this reason, it is said that the noble disciples at that time dwell in contemplation of feeling in regard to feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b24_2']	豈不此位出持息念？	豈不此位出持息念？	Isn't this state of mind already beyond mindfulness of breathing?
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b25_3']	不爾，彼加行意樂不息故，速復更起緣風念故。	不爾，彼加行意樂不息故，速復更起緣風念故。	No, because the intention and aspiration of that [mindfulness of breathing] are not yet ended, and because one quickly gives rise to mindfulness of wind again.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b25_17']	若爾，何故唯覺喜樂不覺餘受？	若爾，何故唯覺喜樂不覺餘受？	If that is so, why is it only aware of joy and pleasure and not aware of other feelings?
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b26_11']	由此二受為貪染因力最勝故。	由此二受為貪染因力最勝故。	Because these two feelings are the most powerful causes of defilement by craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b27_11']	行者欲令心於貪染速解脫故，偏觀喜樂。	行者欲令心於貪染速解脫故，偏觀喜樂。	The practitioner wishes to quickly liberate the mind from defilement by craving, so he only contemplates joy and pleasure.

['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b29_1']	此非息念，是彼加行所生功德，故覺喜樂立息念名。	此非息念，是彼加行所生功德，故覺喜樂立息念名。	This is not mindfulness of breathing, but a merit produced by its preparatory practice, so it is called mindfulness of breathing because it is aware of joy and pleasure.

['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673b29_19']	下三根本靜慮正在定位亦有捨受。	下三根本靜慮正在定位亦有捨受。	The three fundamental meditative states of dhyāna have the feeling of indifference in the state of samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673c01_17']	彼說此念通依八地，上定現前息便無故。	彼說此念通依八地，上定現前息便無故。	It is said that this mindfulness is found in the eight stages, because when the higher samādhis are present, the breath is absent.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673c02_16']	此念但緣息風為境，非通緣上所說六風。	此念但緣息風為境，非通緣上所說六風。	This mindfulness takes only the wind of the breath as its object and not the six winds mentioned above.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673c03_17']	此念初依欲界身起，唯人天趣，除北俱盧。	此念初依欲界身起，唯人天趣，除北俱盧。	This mindfulness first arises in the body of the desire realm, only in the destinies of humans and celestials, excluding the northern continent Uttarakuru.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673c05_10']	唯加行得非離染得，未離染者定由加行現在前故，非離染得地所攝故。	唯加行得非離染得，未離染者定由加行現在前故，非離染得地所攝故。	It is acquired only by exertion and not by the elimination of passions, because those who have not eliminated passions must manifest it by exertion, and because it is not acquired by the elimination of passions, since it is included in the stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673c06_4']	已說皆是近分地攝，非根本故。	已說皆是近分地攝，非根本故。	It is said that it is included in the preliminary concentration stages and not in the fundamental stages.

It is associated only with the mental activity of true suchness.

['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673c09_12']	外道無有，無說者故，彼不能覺微細法故。	外道無有，無說者故，彼不能覺微細法故。	Non-Buddhists do not have it, because there is no one to teach it to them, and because they are unable to understand subtle dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_060:0673c10_12']	此與我執極相違故，彼我執有，故此念無。	此與我執極相違故，彼我執有，故此念無。	Because it is in extreme opposition to the grasping of a self, and because the grasping of a self exists, therefore mindfulness does not exist.
