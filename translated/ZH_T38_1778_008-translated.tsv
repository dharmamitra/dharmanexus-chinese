['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c09_33']	24 維摩經略疏卷第二十四此下四品次〈不思議品〉來者，略用三義通釋：	24 維摩經略疏卷第二十四此下四品次〈不思議品〉來者，略用三義通釋：	008	The next four chapters after this, starting with the Chapter on the Inconceivable, are explained using three general meanings:
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c11_4']	一明此品及下三品來意、二略釋此品名、三帖釋入文。	一明此品及下三品來意、二略釋此品名、三帖釋入文。	008	First, clarifying the purpose of this chapter and the following three chapters; second, briefly explaining the name of this chapter; third, explaining the text by matching it.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c12_2']	一、釋來意者，上〈不思議〉一品成上果義。	一、釋來意者，上〈不思議〉一品成上果義。	008	First, explaining the purpose: the previous chapter on the inconceivable completes the meaning of the fruition above.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c12_15']	近而為語，即成〈問疾品〉。	近而為語，即成〈問疾品〉。	008	Speaking from a close perspective, it completes the chapter on inquiring about illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c16_9']	室內除諸所有表十方佛土皆空，唯置一床以疾而臥正表法身有大悲應用，為成此義廣明住不思議解脫有種種莫測之事，正明權疾非疾現疾，不思議因緣利物之疾。	室內除諸所有表十方佛土皆空，唯置一床以疾而臥正表法身有大悲應用，為成此義廣明住不思議解脫有種種莫測之事，正明權疾非疾現疾，不思議因緣利物之疾。	008	In the room, all appearances are removed, and the buddha lands in the ten directions are all empty, only a bed is placed, and he lies sick, which correctly represents the Dharma body having great compassion and application. In order to accomplish this meaning, it extensively clarifies abiding in inconceivable liberation having various unfathomable matters, correctly clarifying the expedient illness that is not illness manifesting illness, the illness of benefiting beings with inconceivable causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c19_5']	遠而為語，成上〈佛國品〉明淨土，身子及眾生罪故不見淨土，螺髻無罪見淨莊嚴，此不思議無方大用，唯應度者乃能見之。	遠而為語，成上〈佛國品〉明淨土，身子及眾生罪故不見淨土，螺髻無罪見淨莊嚴，此不思議無方大用，唯應度者乃能見之。	008	Speaking from a distance, it completes the above chapter on the Buddha Land, clarifying the pure land. Because Śāriputra and sentient beings have offenses, they do not see the pure land. The conch-haired one, being without offenses, sees the pure adornments. This inconceivable, unrestricted great function can only be seen by those who are to be liberated.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c21_14']	次從此品去有四品，近而為語，正為成〈問疾品〉三教慰喻、三觀調伏三種有疾菩薩，此中廣說，故得釋成上也。	次從此品去有四品，近而為語，正為成〈問疾品〉三教慰喻、三觀調伏三種有疾菩薩，此中廣說，故得釋成上也。	008	Next, from this chapter onward there are four chapters. Speaking from a near perspective, it is precisely to complete the chapter on inquiring about illness, comforting with the three teachings, and taming with the three contemplations for the three kinds of bodhisattvas with illness. This is extensively explained here, and therefore it can be used to explain the above.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c22_8']	遠而為論，亦得兼成室外四品也。	遠而為論，亦得兼成室外四品也。	008	Speaking from a distant perspective, it can also be used to supplement the four chapters outside the room.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c24_13']	分此四品對上〈問疾品〉三教慰喻三觀調伏實疾菩薩者，此品即成〈問疾品〉從假入空觀調伏也。	分此四品對上〈問疾品〉三教慰喻三觀調伏實疾菩薩者，此品即成〈問疾品〉從假入空觀調伏也。	008	Distinguishing these four chapters against the three teachings of consolation and the three contemplations of subduing the real illness of the bodhisattvas in the Chapter on Inquiring about Illness, this chapter is the Chapter on Inquiring about Illness from the contemplation of entering emptiness and subduing.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c26_16']	上云「今我病者，從前世妄想生乃至我及涅槃是二皆空，得此法者無有餘病唯有空病，空病亦空。	上云「今我病者，從前世妄想生乃至我及涅槃是二皆空，得此法者無有餘病唯有空病，空病亦空。	008	Above it says, Now my illness arises from the deluded thoughts of past lives, up to me and nirvana, these two are both empty. One who attains this dharma has no other illness but only the illness of emptiness, and the illness of emptiness is also empty.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c28_4']	」上文直約入空，未辨約空起四無量心，此品具辨，故小異也。	」上文直約入空，未辨約空起四無量心，此品具辨，故小異也。	008	The above text directly discusses entering emptiness, but it does not distinguish the arising of the four immeasurable minds based on emptiness. This chapter fully distinguishes it, so it is slightly different.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0671c29_13']	又上但明入空，此品文殊有窮源之問，淨名答至無住源本方止。	又上但明入空，此品文殊有窮源之問，淨名答至無住源本方止。	008	Moreover, above it only clarifies entering emptiness, but in this chapter Mañjuśrī has a question that reaches the ultimate source, and Vimalakīrti's answer stops at the original source of non-abiding.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a01_11']	又天女、身子往復問答分明，故廣上也。	又天女、身子往復問答分明，故廣上也。	008	Moreover, the questions and answers between the celestial maiden and Śāriputra are clear, so it elaborates on the above.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a02_10']	次〈佛道品〉釋成〈問疾品〉從空入假觀調伏。	次〈佛道品〉釋成〈問疾品〉從空入假觀調伏。	008	Next, the Chapter on the Buddha Way explains the Chapter on Inquiring about Illness from the contemplation of entering the provisional and subduing.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a03_15']	上云「以無所受而受諸受，未具佛法亦不滅受而取證也。	上云「以無所受而受諸受，未具佛法亦不滅受而取證也。	008	Above it says, By not grasping, one grasps all the various feelings. Before the Buddha's teachings are complete, one also does not extinguish feelings to attain realization.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a04_3']	」即從空入假觀。	」即從空入假觀。	008	This is entering the contemplation of emptiness and conventionality.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a05_12']	今〈佛道品〉云「行於非道通達佛道」，即決上〈問疾品〉明入假分明。	今〈佛道品〉云「行於非道通達佛道」，即決上〈問疾品〉明入假分明。	008	Now the chapter on the Buddha Way says, Practicing the non-way to penetrate the Buddha way, which decisively clarifies the chapter on inquiring about illness to illuminate the clear entry into conventionality.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a06_17']	三、〈入不二法門〉、〈香積〉兩品，釋成〈問疾品〉明中道正觀調伏。	三、〈入不二法門〉、〈香積〉兩品，釋成〈問疾品〉明中道正觀調伏。	008	Third, the two chapters on entering the non-dual Dharma gate and the fragrant accumulation clarify the chapter on inquiring about illness to illuminate the middle way correct contemplation and subduing.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a08_12']	上云「如我病者非真非有，眾生病亦非真非有」，又說「非垢行非淨行」道觀雙流。	上云「如我病者非真非有，眾生病亦非真非有」，又說「非垢行非淨行」道觀雙流。	008	Above it says, As for my illness, it is neither real nor existent. The illness of sentient beings is also neither real nor existent. It also says, Neither practicing defilement nor practicing purity. The contemplation of the way flows together.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a10_1']	〈入不二法門品〉明諸菩薩悉入不二法門，成〈問疾品〉明非真非有；	〈入不二法門品〉明諸菩薩悉入不二法門，成〈問疾品〉明非真非有；	008	The chapter on entering the non-dual Dharma gate clarifies that all bodhisattvas enter the non-dual Dharma gate, accomplishing the chapter on inquiring about illness to illuminate neither existence nor non-existence;
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a11_2']	〈香積品〉垢淨雙遊，成〈問疾品〉明道觀雙流義也。	〈香積品〉垢淨雙遊，成〈問疾品〉明道觀雙流義也。	008	The chapter on fragrant accumulation, with defilement and purity both wandering, accomplishes the chapter on inquiring about illness to illuminate the meaning of the contemplation of the way flowing together.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a11_16']	若遠論者，兼得成上室外四品。	若遠論者，兼得成上室外四品。	008	If we discuss it from a distance, it also completes the four chapters outside the room above.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a12_18', 'ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a15_3']	此品成上為國王長者說身無常夢幻等喻令求法身。🔽〈方便品〉但明世諦有為緣集通教體假入空，未辨染真諦涅槃空病亦空，今此具辨，故得廣上也。	此品成上為國王長者說身無常夢幻等喻令求法身。 〈方便品〉但明世諦有為緣集通教體假入空，未辨染真諦涅槃空病亦空，今此具辨，故得廣上也。	008	This chapter completes the above by saying to the kings and elders that the body is impermanent, like a dream or an illusion, and so forth, causing them to seek the Dharma body.🔽The chapter on skillful means only clarifies the conventional truth, conditioned arising, and the teaching of emptiness through the provisional, and has not yet distinguished the sickness of defiling true emptiness and nirvana. Now this fully distinguishes it, and therefore it can expand on the above.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a18_13']	次〈佛道品〉成上〈弟子品〉明別教義者，彈呵弟子為取證真諦涅槃無入假方便，今明行於非道通達佛道，廣辨入假名非道，破恒沙無知，善於知見得無礙礙。	次〈佛道品〉成上〈弟子品〉明別教義者，彈呵弟子為取證真諦涅槃無入假方便，今明行於非道通達佛道，廣辨入假名非道，破恒沙無知，善於知見得無礙礙。	008	Next, the chapter on the Buddha's path completes the chapter on disciples above to clarify the meaning of the separate teaching. It rebukes the disciples for attaining true emptiness and nirvana without the skillful means of entering the provisional. Now it clarifies practicing the non-way to penetrate the Buddha's way, extensively distinguishing entering the provisional as the non-way, breaking through the innumerable ignorances, and skillfully attaining unobstructedness in knowledge and vision.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a23_1']	次〈入不二法門品〉、〈香積品〉成上〈菩薩品〉圓教義者，若別教菩薩歷別修行，在因雖能入假，不能雙遊真俗，今〈入不二法門品〉入則生滅俱泯，〈香積品〉出則有無淨穢同遊，顯圓教法門除自體緣集。	次〈入不二法門品〉、〈香積品〉成上〈菩薩品〉圓教義者，若別教菩薩歷別修行，在因雖能入假，不能雙遊真俗，今〈入不二法門品〉入則生滅俱泯，〈香積品〉出則有無淨穢同遊，顯圓教法門除自體緣集。	008	Next, the Chapter on Entering the Non-dual Dharma Gate and the Chapter on Fragrant Accumulation complete the meaning of the perfect teaching in the Bodhisattva Chapter. If the bodhisattvas of the separate teaching practice separately, although they can enter the provisional in the cause, they cannot both dwell in the true and the conventional. Now, in the Chapter on Entering the Non-dual Dharma Gate, entering means the extinction of both arising and cessation. In the Chapter on Fragrant Accumulation, emerging means the same dwelling in existence and nonexistence, purity and defilement. It reveals the perfect teaching's Dharma gate, removing the conditions of one's own essence.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a23_19']	今得扶成〈佛國品〉者，成佛國因義也。	今得扶成〈佛國品〉者，成佛國因義也。	008	Now, obtaining support to complete the Chapter on the Buddha Land is the meaning of completing the cause of the Buddha land.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a25_8']	所以然者，緣縛若斷即得往生，若成佛時所化眾生即得來生其國也。	所以然者，緣縛若斷即得往生，若成佛時所化眾生即得來生其國也。	008	The reason for this is that if the bondage of conditions is severed, one can then be reborn. If one becomes a Buddha, the sentient beings to be transformed can then be reborn in their land.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a25_16']	此四品即為三段：	此四品即為三段：	008	These four chapters are divided into three sections:
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a29_4']	一〈觀眾生品〉正明從假入空觀、二〈佛道品〉正明從空入假觀、三〈入不二法門品〉、〈香積品〉明中道正觀雙流也，今此一品即是初明通相從假入空觀也。	一〈觀眾生品〉正明從假入空觀、二〈佛道品〉正明從空入假觀、三〈入不二法門品〉、〈香積品〉明中道正觀雙流也，今此一品即是初明通相從假入空觀也。	008	The first chapter, Contemplating Sentient Beings, clearly explains the contemplation of entering emptiness from the provisional. The second chapter, The Buddha Way, clearly explains the contemplation of entering the provisional from emptiness. The third chapter, Entering the Gate of the Non-dual Dharma, and the chapter on Fragrant Accumulation, explain the contemplation of the middle way that flows together. This chapter is the first to explain the general characteristics of entering emptiness from the provisional.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672a29_12']	二、略釋此品名。	二、略釋此品名。	008	Second, a brief explanation of the name of this chapter.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b01_15']	言「觀眾生」者，前〈問疾品〉明從假入空，但觀自身之疾；	言「觀眾生」者，前〈問疾品〉明從假入空，但觀自身之疾；	008	As for contemplating sentient beings, the previous chapter on Inquiring about Illness explains entering emptiness from the provisional, but only contemplates one's own illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b02_15']	今此品明從假入空，即觀自之與他一如無二。	今此品明從假入空，即觀自之與他一如無二。	008	This chapter explains entering emptiness from the provisional, which is to contemplate oneself and others as one, without duality.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b03_12']	《華嚴》云「心佛及眾生，是三無差別。	《華嚴》云「心佛及眾生，是三無差別。	008	The Flower Ornament Sutra says, The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings, these three are no different.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b04_10']	」自之與他互舉一邊，若不達自則不達他。	」自之與他互舉一邊，若不達自則不達他。	008	One's own and others mutually bring up one side. If one does not understand oneself, then one does not understand others.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b05_13']	上明達自自調，今此達他慈悲接物，故云觀眾生品。	上明達自自調，今此達他慈悲接物，故云觀眾生品。	008	Above it explains understanding oneself and self-cultivation. This now understands others and compassionately connects with beings, thus it is called the chapter on contemplating sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b06_6']	觀以觀達為義，亦是觀穿。	觀以觀達為義，亦是觀穿。	008	Contemplation means to penetrate through observation.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b06_19']	言觀達者，達眾生本源清淨。	言觀達者，達眾生本源清淨。	008	Penetrating observation means to penetrate to the original purity of sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b08_6']	如從假入空觀之所照達，雖復凡聖有殊，同歸空寂一如無二。	如從假入空觀之所照達，雖復凡聖有殊，同歸空寂一如無二。	008	Although there is a difference between ordinary beings and sages, they both return to the same emptiness and tranquility, without duality.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b09_3']	故《華嚴》云「如心佛亦爾，如佛眾生然。	故《華嚴》云「如心佛亦爾，如佛眾生然。	008	Therefore, the Huayan Sutra says, Just as the mind, so is the Buddha; just as the Buddha, so are sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b09_15']	心佛及眾生，是三無差別。	心佛及眾生，是三無差別。	008	The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings - these three are no different.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b10_10']	」上文云「彌勒如眾生如，一如無二。	」上文云「彌勒如眾生如，一如無二。	008	The above text says, Maitreya's suchness and sentient beings' suchness are one suchness, without duality.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b11_2']	」此即了達眾生畢竟清淨。	」此即了達眾生畢竟清淨。	008	This is precisely the thorough understanding and penetration of sentient beings' ultimate purity.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b14_11']	俗諦生空、真諦法空、中道第一義諦真平等空，達此三理深義者，眾生三諦惑障不同，所謂取相、無知、無明之別，雖有三惑障三諦理，菩薩照了通達無礙。	俗諦生空、真諦法空、中道第一義諦真平等空，達此三理深義者，眾生三諦惑障不同，所謂取相、無知、無明之別，雖有三惑障三諦理，菩薩照了通達無礙。	008	The conventional truth of the emptiness of beings, the true truth of the emptiness of phenomena, and the middle way of the ultimate truth of true equality and emptiness - one who penetrates these three principles deeply, understands that the afflictive hindrances of sentient beings with regard to the three truths are not the same, namely the distinctions of grasping characteristics, ignorance, and nescience. Although there are three kinds of afflictions that obstruct the principle of the three truths, bodhisattvas thoroughly understand and penetrate them without obstruction.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b15_17']	故《大經》云「即用利鑺斷之，磐石沙礫直過無礙，徹至金剛。	故《大經》云「即用利鑺斷之，磐石沙礫直過無礙，徹至金剛。	008	Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: Using a sharp axe to cut through, the rocks, sand, and gravel are directly penetrated without obstruction, reaching the vajra.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b16_4']	」即是觀達義也。	」即是觀達義也。	008	This is the meaning of penetrating insight.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b19_1']	觀穿義者，菩薩從假入空時，貫穿俗諦見思之磐石、滯真無知之沙、無明覆蔽一實之礫，洞徹無礙，即是窮至心性本際金剛。	觀穿義者，菩薩從假入空時，貫穿俗諦見思之磐石、滯真無知之沙、無明覆蔽一實之礫，洞徹無礙，即是窮至心性本際金剛。	008	As for the meaning of penetrating insight, when bodhisattvas enter emptiness from the provisional, they penetrate through the rocks of views and thoughts in the conventional truth, the sand of attachment to truth and ignorance, and the gravel of ignorance covering the one true reality, and directly penetrate without obstruction, reaching the vajra of the fundamental nature of the mind.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b20_13']	故《法華》云「譬如有人渴乏須水，於彼高原穿鑿求之，猶見乾土知水尚遠。	故《法華》云「譬如有人渴乏須水，於彼高原穿鑿求之，猶見乾土知水尚遠。	008	Therefore, the Lotus Sūtra says: It is like a person who is thirsty and needs water, digging for it on a high plain. Seeing only dry soil, he knows the water is still far away.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b21_17', 'ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b22_12']	施功不已轉見濕土，遂漸至泥，其心決定知水必近。🔽」見乾土者，觀眾生假，見真諦也。	施功不已轉見濕土，遂漸至泥，其心決定知水必近。 」見乾土者，觀眾生假，見真諦也。	008	Not giving up his efforts, he sees wet soil, and eventually reaches mud. He is certain that the water must be near.🔽Seeing dry soil is like contemplating the provisional nature of sentient beings and seeing the truth.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b23_6']	見濕土者，觀真不住，見假無礙。	見濕土者，觀真不住，見假無礙。	008	Seeing wet soil is like contemplating the truth without dwelling and seeing the provisional without obstruction.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b24_12']	遂漸至泥者，此明中道與無明合，如水與泥合，故言至泥。	遂漸至泥者，此明中道與無明合，如水與泥合，故言至泥。	008	Gradually reaching mud means that the middle way combines with ignorance, like water combining with mud, so it is said to reach mud.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b25_15']	若得清水，即中道理顯，離無明泥澄淳清淨即真解脫。	若得清水，即中道理顯，離無明泥澄淳清淨即真解脫。	008	If clear water is obtained, then the principle of the middle way is revealed, and being separated from the mud of ignorance, pure and clear, is true liberation.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b26_18']	故入此品明觀眾生有三種，即擬此三，即觀達義。	故入此品明觀眾生有三種，即擬此三，即觀達義。	008	Therefore, entering this chapter clarifies contemplating sentient beings having three kinds, which correspond to these three, and the meaning of penetrating contemplation.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b28_7']	又下文窮源撿之至無住本，即是觀穿五住至心本際金剛理也。	又下文窮源撿之至無住本，即是觀穿五住至心本際金剛理也。	008	Moreover, the text below exhaustively examines the source to the fundamental non-abiding, which is precisely contemplating penetrating the five abiding [afflictions] to the fundamental principle of the mind, the principle of vajra.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672b29_9']	言眾生者，即是陰入等法攬此為身，名眾生也。	言眾生者，即是陰入等法攬此為身，名眾生也。	008	As for sentient beings, they are the dharmas such as the aggregates and sense bases that are grasped to form the body, called sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672c01_6']	《毘曇》明所成眾生是無，能成實法是有。	《毘曇》明所成眾生是無，能成實法是有。	008	The Abhidharma clarifies that the formed sentient beings are non-existent, while the forming real dharmas exist.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672c01_20']	犢子云「我在第五不可說藏」。	犢子云「我在第五不可說藏」。	008	The Vātsīputrīya say, I am in the fifth indemonstrable storehouse.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672c02_17']	《成實》云「非但所成是假，能成亦假。	《成實》云「非但所成是假，能成亦假。	008	The Satyasiddhi says, Not only is the formed false, the forming is also false.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672c04_7']	」故以三假為世諦有假眾生，若空入真即無眾生，非但無所成亦無能成。	」故以三假為世諦有假眾生，若空入真即無眾生，非但無所成亦無能成。	008	Therefore, the three provisional posits are considered to be the provisional existence of sentient beings in the conventional truth. If one enters the true through emptiness, then there are no sentient beings. Not only is there nothing that is accomplished, but also there is no one who accomplishes.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0672c05_2']	此折假明能成所成以入空也。	此折假明能成所成以入空也。	008	This refutes the provisional and clarifies that both that which is accomplished and that which accomplishes enter emptiness.

You should know that when the bodhisattva enters emptiness from the provisional, although they enter emptiness together with the omniscience, within this emptiness they see the principle of the three truths and possess the three knowledges.

Not only are there no sentient beings, but also no real dharmas. The path of language is cut off, the realm of mental activity ceases, like the fifth great element and so forth, lacking this principle. This is contemplating sentient beings entering the ultimate truth, not seeing the characteristics of sentient beings.

The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says that those who have something to attain are called Hīnayāna, but those who only realize emptiness and have nothing to attain are called Mahāyāna.

The higher contemplation is that of the bodhisattvas, and the highest is that of the Buddha.

['ZH_T38_1778_008:0681b25_10']	一天自變為身子問、二身子以女像答、三天為解釋、四引佛語證。	一天自變為身子問、二身子以女像答、三天為解釋、四引佛語證。	008	First, the celestial being himself transforms into Śāriputra asking questions; second, Śāriputra answers with the appearance of a woman; third, the celestial being explains; fourth, citing the Buddha's words as evidence.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0681b27_13']	一、天自變為身子，轉身子為天女，而用身子像問者，即是上明神力為女，若不攝神力不可轉義。	一、天自變為身子，轉身子為天女，而用身子像問者，即是上明神力為女，若不攝神力不可轉義。	008	First, the celestial being himself transforms into Śāriputra, transforming Śāriputra into a celestial woman, and using Śāriputra's appearance to ask questions. This is the above explanation of using spiritual powers to become a woman. If one does not withdraw their spiritual powers, the meaning of transformation is impossible.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0681b28_14']	此表若業不轉凡女不轉，若機不轉應亦不轉。	此表若業不轉凡女不轉，若機不轉應亦不轉。	008	This illustrates that if karma does not transform, ordinary women do not transform. If the capacity does not transform, the response also does not transform.

It is like Śāriputra, who is held by the supernormal powers and thus cannot change, while all women are held by karma and ultimately cannot change.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0681c07_18']	若一切女人不除業而能轉者，則身子亦能轉也。	若一切女人不除業而能轉者，則身子亦能轉也。	008	If all women can change without eliminating karma, then Śāriputra can also change.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0681c09_9']	如舍利弗非女，為他神力變為女身，一切女人而為業力變為女身。	如舍利弗非女，為他神力變為女身，一切女人而為業力變為女身。	008	It is like Śāriputra, who is not a woman, but is transformed into a woman's body by the supernormal powers of others, while all women are transformed into women's bodies by the power of karma.

['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b15_2']	」所以作此並者，若身子問法身究竟成道，此乃十住不見其始，唯佛與佛乃能究盡。	」所以作此並者，若身子問法身究竟成道，此乃十住不見其始，唯佛與佛乃能究盡。	008	The reason for this is that if Śāriputra asks about the ultimate attainment of the Dharma body, this is the ten abodes not seeing its beginning, only the Buddhas and Buddhas are able to thoroughly understand it.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b16_15']	天設答身子時節久如，如《法華》明大通成道王子行因，身子豈能知此八相？	天設答身子時節久如，如《法華》明大通成道王子行因，身子豈能知此八相？	008	If the heavenly one answers Śāriputra about the length of time, it is like the Lotus Sūtra's explanation of Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū's attainment of Buddhahood and the princes practicing the causes, how could Śāriputra be able to know this eightfold appearance?
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b17_14']	祇得無生即能八相隨緣作佛，何須致問。	祇得無生即能八相隨緣作佛，何須致問。	008	He only attains non-arising and is able to follow conditions and become a Buddha in the eightfold appearance, why is it necessary to ask?
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b20_3']	次天自釋言「菩提無住處故無得」者，此是法身觀不思議真諦空無方所，諸佛不能行不能到，故說無有得者。	次天自釋言「菩提無住處故無得」者，此是法身觀不思議真諦空無方所，諸佛不能行不能到，故說無有得者。	008	Next, the heavenly one himself explains, Bodhi has no dwelling place, therefore it cannot be attained. This is the contemplation of the Dharma body, the inconceivable true emptiness without direction, the Buddhas are unable to practice it or reach it, therefore it is said that there is no one who can attain it.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b21_9']	「舍利弗言」下，二、身子約思議俗諦問，天還約不思議真諦答。	「舍利弗言」下，二、身子約思議俗諦問，天還約不思議真諦答。	008	Śāriputra said below, second, Śāriputra uses the conceivable conventional truth to ask, and the heavenly one still uses the inconceivable true truth to answer.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b23_8']	初身子問言「今諸佛得菩提如恒河沙」者，此將通教俗諦八相為問，故云如恒河沙。	初身子問言「今諸佛得菩提如恒河沙」者，此將通教俗諦八相為問，故云如恒河沙。	008	First, Śāriputra asked, Now, the Buddhas who attain bodhi are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. This is a question using the conventional truth of the common teachings and the eight appearances, hence it says as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b24_12']	所以然者，三藏不說有十方佛，雖有此意，義不彰顯。	所以然者，三藏不說有十方佛，雖有此意，義不彰顯。	008	The reason for this is that the Tripiṭaka does not speak of the existence of Buddhas in the ten directions, although it has this meaning, the meaning is not clearly expressed.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682b26_1']	次天即答云「皆以世俗文字說有三世之佛」，非謂真諦而有三世。	次天即答云「皆以世俗文字說有三世之佛」，非謂真諦而有三世。	008	Next, the god immediately replied, All use the conventional written language to speak of the three periods of time of the Buddha, not that the ultimate truth has the three periods of time.

This is like the Buddha's four-line question to Subhūti in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, and Subhūti's reply of not abiding in the four lines but truly attaining the path. This is the transcendence of the conceivable conventional four lines to see the truth and attain the path.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c02_12']	天曰「諸佛菩薩亦復如是」，是絕不思議俗四句，見不思議真得道。	天曰「諸佛菩薩亦復如是」，是絕不思議俗四句，見不思議真得道。	008	The goddess said, The buddhas and bodhisattvas are also like this. This is the transcendence of the four propositions of the inconceivable conventional truth, seeing the inconceivable true reality and attaining the Way.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c04_14']	所以然者，天意小乘思議得道尚以無得為得，何況大乘不思議得道而不絕四句無所得而得。	所以然者，天意小乘思議得道尚以無得為得，何況大乘不思議得道而不絕四句無所得而得。	008	The reason for this is that the goddess's meaning is that even the Hinayana's conceivable attainment of the Way still takes non-attainment as attainment, let alone the Mahayana's inconceivable attainment of the Way, which transcends the four propositions, has nothing to attain, and yet attains.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c05_6']	語類相竝，其意天隔。	語類相竝，其意天隔。	008	The language is similar, but the meaning is vastly different.

['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c12_2']	一、「已曾供養九十二億佛」者，是順佛教能觀因緣三諦，故得栖此空室以慈悲熏，現天女像，散如法華平等供養。	一、「已曾供養九十二億佛」者，是順佛教能觀因緣三諦，故得栖此空室以慈悲熏，現天女像，散如法華平等供養。	008	First, having already made offerings to 92 koṭīs of Buddhas means in accordance with the Buddha's teachings one is able to contemplate the three truths of dependent arising, thus attaining to dwell in this empty room, and with the permeation of compassion manifesting the appearance of a celestial maiden, scattering offerings equal to those of the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c14_7']	表通惑已盡、別惑侵除，得文字性離不思議解脫，即是述成天女答身子初問，明若離別惑華不著身。	表通惑已盡、別惑侵除，得文字性離不思議解脫，即是述成天女答身子初問，明若離別惑華不著身。	008	This illustrates that the common delusions are already exhausted and the separate delusions are mostly removed, attaining the inconceivable liberation of the separation of the nature of words, which is precisely the restatement of the celestial maiden's answer to Śāriputra's first question, clarifying that if one is apart from the separate delusions the flowers will not adhere to one's body.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c15_9']	亦述成答身子第二問，明思議不思議二脫不同。	亦述成答身子第二問，明思議不思議二脫不同。	008	It also restates the answer to Śāriputra's second question, clarifying that the two liberations of the conceivable and inconceivable are not the same.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c17_12']	二、「遊戲神通誓願具足」者，述入瞻蔔林不嗅餘香，亦述答第四轉女身問，如本願故現女身也。	二、「遊戲神通誓願具足」者，述入瞻蔔林不嗅餘香，亦述答第四轉女身問，如本願故現女身也。	008	Second, playing with spiritual powers and vows fulfilled restates entering the jasmine grove and not smelling other fragrances, and also restates the answer to the fourth question about transforming the female body, manifesting the female body according to the original vow.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c19_11']	三、「得無生忍」，即是述第六身子問久如得菩提，天女答無所得故而得，即是法身成道。	三、「得無生忍」，即是述第六身子問久如得菩提，天女答無所得故而得，即是法身成道。	008	Third, attaining the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas is the explanation of the sixth question by Śāriputra asking about the time of attaining enlightenment. The celestial maiden answered that it is attained because of non-attainment, which is the attainment of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T38_1778_008:0682c21_6']	四、「以本願故隨意能現教化眾生」，即是述第五身子問沒生，天女答如佛化生。	四、「以本願故隨意能現教化眾生」，即是述第五身子問沒生，天女答如佛化生。	008	Fourth, according to the original vow, one can manifest and teach and transform sentient beings as one wishes is the explanation of the fifth question by Śāriputra asking about passing away and being born. The celestial maiden answered that it is like the Buddha's transformation birth.
