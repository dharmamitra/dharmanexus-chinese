['ZH_T34_1720_007:0416c12_3']	初就一化始終具有八譬，次就正譬但有其六，後據子自序始終故有十譬，次就文意但有九。	初就一化始終具有八譬，次就正譬但有其六，後據子自序始終故有十譬，次就文意但有九。	007	The first is about the beginning and end of a single transformation, which has eight parables. Next, it is about the main parable, which only has six. Later, it is about the child's own account of the beginning and end, so there are ten parables. Next, it is about the meaning of the text, which only has nine.

['ZH_T34_1720_007:0416c18_2']	若領上者，父子相失領上總譬，總譬雖有六義而不出能化所化，故明父子相失即領總譬也。	若領上者，父子相失領上總譬，總譬雖有六義而不出能化所化，故明父子相失即領總譬也。	007	If it refers to the above, the separation of father and son refers to the general parable above. Although the general parable has six meanings, it does not go beyond the means of conversion and those to be converted, so clarifying the separation of father and son is precisely referring to the general parable.
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0416c19_17']	又見火譬中明父子相失，如云「汝諸子等先因遊戲來入此宅」，即是子失父義。	又見火譬中明父子相失，如云「汝諸子等先因遊戲來入此宅」，即是子失父義。	007	Moreover, in the parable of seeing the fire, it clarifies the separation of father and son, as it says, Your children, because of their previous play, have come into this house, which is the meaning of the child losing the father.

['ZH_T34_1720_007:0416c24_10']	父子相見譬、頭上見火譬，但上明見火，正是法身地見，故云「是時長者在門外立」，〈方便品〉亦然，故云「我以佛眼觀見六道眾生」，謂法身地見也。	父子相見譬、頭上見火譬，但上明見火，正是法身地見，故云「是時長者在門外立」，〈方便品〉亦然，故云「我以佛眼觀見六道眾生」，謂法身地見也。	007	The parables of father and son seeing each other and seeing fire on the head, only above it is said to see fire, which is precisely seeing from the ground of the Dharma body, so it is said at that time the elder stood outside the gate, the chapter on skillful means is also like this, so it is said I observe with the Buddha eye and see sentient beings of the six paths, which means seeing from the ground of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0416c25_6']	今云父子相見者，可就本迹二處明之。	今云父子相見者，可就本迹二處明之。	007	Now, as for the father and son seeing each other, it can be explained in terms of the two places of the essence and traces.

['ZH_T34_1720_007:0416c28_17']	若爾，從其父先來求子，不得此中即含子見父、父見子義也。	若爾，從其父先來求子，不得此中即含子見父、父見子義也。	007	If so, from the father's seeking the child before, not finding him, this already contains the meaning of the child seeing the father and the father seeing the child.
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a01_2']	二者就迹中而言，初成道時見其大機當發，名父見子；	二者就迹中而言，初成道時見其大機當發，名父見子；	007	Second, speaking in terms of the traces, when the Buddha first attained enlightenment, he saw that the great opportunity was about to arise, which was called the father seeing the child;
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a02_1']	中止一城踞師子座，爾時始明父子相見。	中止一城踞師子座，爾時始明父子相見。	007	Stopping in a city and sitting on a lion seat, at that time they just began to clarify the father and son seeing each other.
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a03_5']	若爾，父子相失及父子相見二譬，相帶領上見火譬也。	若爾，父子相失及父子相見二譬，相帶領上見火譬也。	007	If so, the two parables of the father and son losing each other and the father and son seeing each other are linked to the above parable of seeing the fire.
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a03_17']	喚子不得，領上救子不得。	喚子不得，領上救子不得。	007	Not being able to call the son is linked to the above not being able to save the son.
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a04_8']	喚子得，領上救子得。	喚子得，領上救子得。	007	Being able to call the son is linked to the above being able to save the son.
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a04_20']	委家業，領上等賜大車也。	委家業，領上等賜大車也。	007	Entrusting the family business is linked to the above equally bestowing the great vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a09_12']	不領不虛譬者，既領一化大宗，方悟佛屈曲恩深、崎岴德重，乃患慚之不足，豈敢疑佛虛哉。	不領不虛譬者，既領一化大宗，方悟佛屈曲恩深、崎岴德重，乃患慚之不足，豈敢疑佛虛哉。	007	As for not linking to the parable of not being in vain, since they already understand the great purport of the teaching, they realize that the Buddha's bending and kindness is deep, and his virtue is heavy. They are ashamed and insufficient, how could they dare doubt the Buddha's falsehood?
['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417a10_7']	又如此而悟，即是總領不虛旨也。	又如此而悟，即是總領不虛旨也。	007	Moreover, understanding in this way is precisely the overall understanding of the meaning of not being in vain.

['ZH_T34_1720_007:0417b22_6']	若就大乘化為得不得者，過去為沙彌時為說大乘即是化得，從背化已後為不得，至法華悟一乘為得。	若就大乘化為得不得者，過去為沙彌時為說大乘即是化得，從背化已後為不得，至法華悟一乘為得。	007	If, in terms of the transformation of the Great Vehicle, attainment and non-attainment are discussed, then when the Buddha was a novice monk in the past, teaching the Great Vehicle is considered successful transformation. After the Buddha turned his back on the teaching, it is considered a failure. Up to the enlightenment of the One Vehicle in the Lotus Sūtra, it is considered a success.

When one attains the first dhyāna, they think they have attained the first fruit, and so on, up to when they attain the fourth dhyāna, they think they have attained the fourth fruit.

The first person has already given rise to the aspiration, but the aspiration has not yet been accomplished, so it is called not yet giving rise to the mind;

If we take the meaning of not slandering, it is superior, but the meaning of not hearing the Dharma is inferior.
