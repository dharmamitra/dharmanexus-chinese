['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b01_13']	然此諸眾或總為一，一乘眾故。	然此諸眾或總為一，一乘眾故。	However, these assemblies can be generally combined into one, because they are the assembly of the One Vehicle.

['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b15_4']	當機之流，多皆是實。	當機之流，多皆是實。	those who are the main audience are mostly real.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b17_5']	諸教所明穢土之中，雜類菩薩聲聞皆通權實，地前是實、地上是權，法身無生生五道故。	諸教所明穢土之中，雜類菩薩聲聞皆通權實，地前是實、地上是權，法身無生生五道故。	In the teachings that clarify the defiled lands, the various kinds of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas are all both provisional and real. Those below the grounds are real, and those on the grounds are provisional, because the Dharma body is born in the five paths without being born.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b17_17']	淨土菩薩唯實，實報生故。	淨土菩薩唯實，實報生故。	The bodhisattvas in the pure lands are only real, because they are born in the reward of reality.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b18_5']	雜類聲聞是權。	雜類聲聞是權。	The various kinds of śrāvakas are provisional.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b19_6']	《攝論》云「欲令淨土不空，化作雜類眾」故。	《攝論》云「欲令淨土不空，化作雜類眾」故。	The Mahāyāna-samgraha says, In order to make the pure lands not empty, they transform into various kinds of assemblies.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b21_18']	若依此經，同生異生皆通權實，海印定現實德攝故、隨緣隨位而示現故、第二會初云「莫不皆是一生補處」故。	若依此經，同生異生皆通權實，海印定現實德攝故、隨緣隨位而示現故、第二會初云「莫不皆是一生補處」故。	If we rely on this sūtra, the same birth and different birth are both provisional and real, because the real virtues of the ocean seal samādhi are included, because they manifest according to conditions and according to the stages, and because it says at the beginning of the second assembly, All are at the stage of one birth before Buddhahood.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b22_16']	對前十類辯權實者，影響一眾自有二類：	對前十類辯權實者，影響一眾自有二類：	When comparing the provisional and true of these ten categories, the assembly of responsive transformation has two categories:
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b23_9']	一果德眾，謂能加證法。	一果德眾，謂能加證法。	First, the assembly of fruition virtues, which refers to those who can add and realize the Dharma.

['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b25_13']	有經云「昔為釋迦師，今為佛弟子。	有經云「昔為釋迦師，今為佛弟子。	There are sūtras that say, In the past he was Śākyamuni's teacher, now he is a disciple of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b26_1']	」二尊不並化故。	」二尊不並化故。	The two Honored Ones do not simultaneously transform the world.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b26_20']	「我為菩薩」等，當機唯實，餘八通權實。	「我為菩薩」等，當機唯實，餘八通權實。	I am a bodhisattva and so forth, the assembly of those who receive the teaching is exclusively true, while the remaining eight are both provisional and true.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b27_8']	第六地位者，有說：	第六地位者，有說：	Regarding the sixth, the stages, some say:
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b28_4']	一切皆是果位，以是舍那海印現故。	一切皆是果位，以是舍那海印現故。	All are stages of fruition, because they are manifested by the ocean seal of Vairocana.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b28_7']	或說：	或說：	Some say:
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b28_19']	一切皆因果海，非可見聞。	一切皆因果海，非可見聞。	All are the ocean of causes and effects, which cannot be seen or heard.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534b29_11']	世尊亦是因者，識所現故。	世尊亦是因者，識所現故。	The World-Honored One is also a cause, because he is manifested by consciousness.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c02_10']	或皆通因果，果得不捨、因隨類現故，因位願力助佛化故，當機之流正修趣故。	或皆通因果，果得不捨、因隨類現故，因位願力助佛化故，當機之流正修趣故。	Some say all are both causes and effects, because the fruition does not abandon the attainment, and the causes manifest according to type. Because the assembly of those who receive the teaching is correctly cultivating and progressing, the stage of causes assists the Buddha's transformation by the power of vows.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c03_6']	或俱非因果，緣起大眾因真性故。	或俱非因果，緣起大眾因真性故。	Or they are neither cause nor effect, because the great assembly of dependent origination is the true nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c04_7']	將此對前權實，則果位一向權、因位通權實。	將此對前權實，則果位一向權、因位通權實。	If we compare this with the previous provisional and true, then the fruition stage is exclusively provisional, while the causal stage is both provisional and true.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c05_16']	若對前十類，影響、證法通因果，餘八唯因，因位高下難以準定。	若對前十類，影響、證法通因果，餘八唯因，因位高下難以準定。	If we compare this with the previous ten categories, then the responsive and verifying Dharma are both cause and effect, while the other eight are only causes. The high and low of the causal stage are difficult to determine.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c07_2']	第七前後者，初列菩薩、後列餘眾者，表從本以起末。	第七前後者，初列菩薩、後列餘眾者，表從本以起末。	As for the seventh, the sequence, the bodhisattvas are listed first and the other assemblies are listed later, symbolizing the branching off from the root to form the branches.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c07_17']	下讚即後明菩薩者，表尋末歸本。	下讚即後明菩薩者，表尋末歸本。	The praise below clarifies the bodhisattvas first, symbolizing the returning to the root after seeking the branches.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c08_12', 'ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c09_12']	良以本末無二故，二文互舉。🔽又從本流末，必先小後大，故自在天為末；	良以本末無二故，二文互舉。 又從本流末，必先小後大，故自在天為末；	This is because the root and branches are non-dual, so the two texts mutually bring them up.🔽Moreover, branching off from the root to form the branches must first be the lesser and then the greater, so the independent heavenly beings are the branches.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c10_10']	攝末歸本，必從深至淺，故先明自在。	攝末歸本，必從深至淺，故先明自在。	Returning the branches to the root must be from the profound to the shallow, so the independent heavenly beings are clarified first.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c11_6']	然皆顯法界緣起逆順自在故也。	然皆顯法界緣起逆順自在故也。	However, they all manifest the free and easy reversal and progression of the dependent origination of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c13_3']	又表四十位，一一皆徹因門並該果海故，互舉前後，令物不作優劣之解故。	又表四十位，一一皆徹因門並該果海故，互舉前後，令物不作優劣之解故。	Moreover, it illustrates the forty stages, each of which penetrates the gate of causes and encompasses the ocean of fruits, so they are mentioned alternately before and after, causing beings not to have the understanding of superiority and inferiority.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0534c13_14']	第八有無者，亦有十類：	第八有無者，亦有十類：	Eighth, as for existence and non-existence, there are also ten categories:

Objects and cognition are not the same.

['ZH_T35_1735_005:0536c21_13']	言寂則異而同，境智無異味故。	言寂則異而同，境智無異味故。	When speaking of quiescence, it is different yet the same, because the object and cognition have no different flavor.
['ZH_T35_1735_005:0536c22_9']	同故無心於彼此，忘心契合故；	同故無心於彼此，忘心契合故；	Because they are the same, there is no mind of self and other, because forgetting the mind accords with reality;
