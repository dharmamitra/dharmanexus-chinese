['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b20_8']	此染污意何受相應？	此染污意何受相應？	With what feeling is this defiled mind associated?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b21_7']	有義，此俱唯有喜受，恒內執我生喜愛故。	有義，此俱唯有喜受，恒內執我生喜愛故。	There is an interpretation that it is only associated with the feeling of joy, because it always grasps an inner self and produces the love of joy.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b22_8']	有義，不然，應許喜受乃至有頂，違聖言故。	有義，不然，應許喜受乃至有頂，違聖言故。	There is an interpretation that this is not so, because it should be admitted that the feeling of joy extends to the peak of existence, and this contradicts the holy teachings.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b23_17']	應說此意四受相應，謂生惡趣，憂受相應，緣不善業所引果故；	應說此意四受相應，謂生惡趣，憂受相應，緣不善業所引果故；	It should be said that this manas is associated with four feelings, because when one is born in evil destinies, it is associated with the feeling of sorrow, because it has as its object the results of evil karma that one has attracted;
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b25_2']	生人欲天初二靜慮，喜受相應，緣有喜地善業果故；	生人欲天初二靜慮，喜受相應，緣有喜地善業果故；	when one is born in the human realm, the heavens of the first two trances, it is associated with the feeling of joy, because it has as its object the results of good karma that exist in the stages associated with joy;
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b26_2']	第三靜慮，樂受相應，緣有樂地善業果故；	第三靜慮，樂受相應，緣有樂地善業果故；	when one is in the third trance, it is associated with the feeling of pleasure, because it has as its object the results of good karma that exist in the stages associated with pleasure;
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b27_6']	第四靜慮乃至有頂，捨受相應，緣唯捨地善業果故。	第四靜慮乃至有頂，捨受相應，緣唯捨地善業果故。	when one is in the fourth trance and above, to the peak of existence, it is associated with the feeling of indifference, because it has as its object only the results of good karma that exist in the stages associated with indifference.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023b29_6']	有義，彼說亦不應理，此無始來任運一類緣內執我恒無轉易，與變異受不相應故。	有義，彼說亦不應理，此無始來任運一類緣內執我恒無轉易，與變異受不相應故。	There is an interpretation by Sthiramati that the above explanation is also unreasonable, because this manas has been evolving from beginningless time in a uniform, spontaneous, and single stream, taking the internal dharmas as its object, and always grasping them as a self, without any change, and therefore it is not associated with the feeling of pain.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c02_15']	又此末那與前藏識義有異者皆別說之，若四受俱亦應別說，既不別說定與彼同，故此相應唯有捨受。	又此末那與前藏識義有異者皆別說之，若四受俱亦應別說，既不別說定與彼同，故此相應唯有捨受。	Also, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that the manas is different from the store consciousness in many ways, and if it were associated with the four feelings, this would have to be mentioned, but it is not, and therefore manas is definitely the same as store consciousness in being associated with only the feeling of indifference.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c04_18']	未轉依位與前所說心所相應，已轉依位唯二十一心所俱起，謂遍行、別境各五、善十一。	未轉依位與前所說心所相應，已轉依位唯二十一心所俱起，謂遍行、別境各五、善十一。	In the stage prior to the transmutation of the support, manas is associated with the above mentioned mental activities, but in the stage of having transmuted the support, it is associated with only twenty one mental activities, namely, the five universal activities, the five activities with specific objects, and the eleven good activities.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c06_5']	如第八識已轉依位、唯捨受俱、任運轉故、恒於所緣平等轉故。	如第八識已轉依位、唯捨受俱、任運轉故、恒於所緣平等轉故。	This is because, like the eighth consciousness in the stage of having transmuted the support, manas in this stage is associated only with the feeling of indifference, evolves spontaneously, and always evolves in a uniform manner with regard to its object.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c06_14']	末那心所何性所攝？	末那心所何性所攝？	To what moral natures do the mental activities associated with manas belong?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c07_5']	有覆無記所攝，非餘。	有覆無記所攝，非餘。	They are categorized as the covered, impure class and not the others.🔽The four passions and so on that are associated with manas are defiled dharmas and therefore are said to be covered, because they cover and obscure the holy paths.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c08_13']	此意相應四煩惱等是染法故，障礙聖道隱蔽自心，說名有覆；	此意相應四煩惱等是染法故，障礙聖道隱蔽自心，說名有覆；	They are impure, because they are not separated from the passions.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c09_4']	非善不善，故名無記。	非善不善，故名無記。	It is called indeterminate because it is neither good nor bad.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c10_3']	如上二界諸煩惱等，定力攝藏是無記攝。	如上二界諸煩惱等，定力攝藏是無記攝。	Like the above passions, etc., of the two upper realms, it is categorized as indeterminate because it is hidden by the power of samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c11_11']	此俱染法所依細故，任運轉故亦無記攝，若已轉依唯是善性。	此俱染法所依細故，任運轉故亦無記攝，若已轉依唯是善性。	The subtle support of dharmas associated with it and its spontaneous evolution are also categorized as indeterminate. If the support has been transformed, it is only good.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c12_1']	末那心所何地繫耶？	末那心所何地繫耶？	To what stages are the mental activities of manas associated with it bound?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c12_10']	隨彼所生彼地所繫。	隨彼所生彼地所繫。	They are bound to the stage in which they are produced.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c15_1']	謂生欲界現行末那相應心所即欲界繫，乃至有頂應知亦然，任運恒緣自地藏識執為內我，非他地故。	謂生欲界現行末那相應心所即欲界繫，乃至有頂應知亦然，任運恒緣自地藏識執為內我，非他地故。	That is, when manas is presently active in the realm of desire, the mental activities associated with it are bound to the realm of desire, and so on, up to the peak of existence. One should understand that this is also so. Manas spontaneously and constantly takes as its object the store consciousness of its own stage and grasps it as a self, because it does not grasp other stages as a self.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c16_1']	若起彼地異熟藏識現在前者，名生彼地。	若起彼地異熟藏識現在前者，名生彼地。	If the store consciousness of another stage is generated and appears in the present, one is born in that stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c17_1']	染污末耶緣彼執我即繫屬彼，名彼所繫。	染污末耶緣彼執我即繫屬彼，名彼所繫。	The defiled manas takes that as an object and grasps it as a self, and so it is bound to that stage. It is called bound to that stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c18_1']	或為彼地諸煩惱等之所繫縛，名彼所繫。	或為彼地諸煩惱等之所繫縛，名彼所繫。	Or, it is bound by the passions, etc., of that stage and is called bound to that stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c18_11']	若已轉依，即非所繫。	若已轉依，即非所繫。	If the support has been transformed, it is not bound.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c19_17']	此染污意無始相續，何位永斷或暫斷耶？	此染污意無始相續，何位永斷或暫斷耶？	This defiled manas is a beginningless continuum. In what states is it permanently or temporarily eliminated?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c20_10']	阿羅漢、滅定出世道無有。	阿羅漢、滅定出世道無有。	It does not exist in arhats, in the samādhi of cessation, or in the transworldly path.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c21_4']	阿羅漢者，總顯三乘無學果位。	阿羅漢者，總顯三乘無學果位。	Arhats refers generally to those in the stage of post-learner of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c22_3']	此位染意種及現行俱永斷滅，故說無有。	此位染意種及現行俱永斷滅，故說無有。	In this stage, the seeds and actual form of defiled manas are both permanently eliminated, and for that reason it is said that it does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c23_3']	學位滅定出世道中俱暫伏滅，故說無有。	學位滅定出世道中俱暫伏滅，故說無有。	In the stage of learner, it is temporarily subdued in the samādhi of cessation and in the transworldly path, and for that reason it is said that it does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c24_11']	謂染污意無始時來微細一類任運而轉，諸有漏道不能伏滅。	謂染污意無始時來微細一類任運而轉，諸有漏道不能伏滅。	That is, defiled manas has been evolving subtly, uniformly, and spontaneously since beginningless time, and the impure paths are unable to subdue it.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c25_11']	三乘聖道有伏滅義，真無我解違我執故。	三乘聖道有伏滅義，真無我解違我執故。	The holy paths of the three vehicles have the meaning of subduing it, because the understanding of true no self contradicts the attachment to a self.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c26_10']	後得無漏現在前時，是彼等流亦違此意。	後得無漏現在前時，是彼等流亦違此意。	When subsequently acquired uncontaminated thought is present, it is the outflow of that understanding and also contradicts this manas.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c27_9']	真無我解及後所得俱無漏故，名出世道。	真無我解及後所得俱無漏故，名出世道。	Because the understanding of true no self and its subsequently acquired knowledge are both uncontaminated, it is called the transworldly path.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c28_8']	滅定既是聖道等流，極寂靜故，此亦非有。	滅定既是聖道等流，極寂靜故，此亦非有。	Since the samādhi of cessation is the outflow of the holy paths, and it is extremely tranquil, it also does not exist in that state.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0023c29_16']	由未永斷此種子故，從滅盡定聖道起已，此復現行乃至未滅。	由未永斷此種子故，從滅盡定聖道起已，此復現行乃至未滅。	Because its seeds have not yet been eternally exterminated, it is active again after one arises from the samādhi of cessation or the holy path, until it is finally exterminated.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a01_15']	然此染意相應煩惱是俱生故，非見所斷；	然此染意相應煩惱是俱生故，非見所斷；	However, the passions associated with this defiled manas are innate and therefore not eliminated by the path of insight.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a02_6']	是染污故，非非所斷。	是染污故，非非所斷。	They are defiled and therefore not eliminated by the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a03_9']	極微細故，所有種子與有頂地下下煩惱一時頓斷。	極微細故，所有種子與有頂地下下煩惱一時頓斷。	They are extremely subtle and their seeds are eliminated suddenly and simultaneously with the subtlest part of the propensities of the peak of existence.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a03_14']	勢力等故。	勢力等故。	Their power is the same.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a05_4']	金剛喻定現在前時，頓斷此種，成阿羅漢，故無學位永不復起。	金剛喻定現在前時，頓斷此種，成阿羅漢，故無學位永不復起。	When the diamond-like samādhi is present, their seeds are suddenly eliminated, and one becomes an arhat. Therefore, they never again appear in the state of post-learing.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a07_6']	二乘無學迴趣大乘，從初發心至未成佛，雖實是菩薩，亦名阿羅漢，應義等故不別說之。	二乘無學迴趣大乘，從初發心至未成佛，雖實是菩薩，亦名阿羅漢，應義等故不別說之。	The two vehicles in the state of post-learning who turn toward the Mahayana, from the first arousal of the bodhi mind until they become Buddhas, are really bodhisattvas, but they are also called arhats, because the meanings of the two terms are the same.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a09_10']	此中有義，末那唯有煩惱障俱，聖教皆言三位無故，又說四惑恒相應故，又說為識雜染依故。	此中有義，末那唯有煩惱障俱，聖教皆言三位無故，又說四惑恒相應故，又說為識雜染依故。	There is an interpretation by Sthiramati that manas is only associated with the obstacle to that which is to be known, because all holy teachings say that it is absent in the three states of samādhi, and because it is said that the four passions are always associated with it, and because it is said that it is the support of the defilement of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a10_10']	有義，彼說教理相違，出世末那經說有故。	有義，彼說教理相違，出世末那經說有故。	There is an interpretation by Sthiramati that the above statements contradict teachings and reason, because a scripture says that the seventh consciousness exists in a supramundane stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a11_10']	無染意識如有染時，定有俱生不共依故。	無染意識如有染時，定有俱生不共依故。	When defiled manas is present, there must be a simultaneous, innate, and unique support, just as when the sixth consciousness is defiled.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a14_17']	論說藏識決定恒與一識俱轉所謂末那，意識起時則二俱轉所謂意識及與末那，若五識中隨起一識則三俱轉，乃至或時頓起五識則七俱轉。	論說藏識決定恒與一識俱轉所謂末那，意識起時則二俱轉所謂意識及與末那，若五識中隨起一識則三俱轉，乃至或時頓起五識則七俱轉。	A treatise says, As for the store consciousness, it definitely evolves simultaneously with one consciousness, namely manas. When mental consciousness arises, then two evolve simultaneously, namely mental consciousness and manas. When one of the five first consciousnesses arises, then three evolve simultaneously, and so on, until finally when all five of the first consciousnesses arise simultaneously, then seven evolve simultaneously.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a16_7']	若住滅定無第七識，爾時藏識應無識俱，便非恒定一識俱轉。	若住滅定無第七識，爾時藏識應無識俱，便非恒定一識俱轉。	If manas does not exist in the samādhi of cessation, then at that time store consciousness must not be associated with any consciousness and is not always associated with only one consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a18_7']	住聖道時若無第七，爾時藏識應一識俱，如何可言若起意識爾時藏識定二俱轉？	住聖道時若無第七，爾時藏識應一識俱，如何可言若起意識爾時藏識定二俱轉？	If manas does not exist in the holy paths, then at that time store consciousness must be associated with only one consciousness. How can you say that when mental consciousness arises, store consciousness is always associated with two consciousnesses?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a19_3']	《顯揚論》說，末那恒與四煩惱相應。	《顯揚論》說，末那恒與四煩惱相應。	The *Mahāynasamgraha says, Manas is always associated with four passions.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a20_8']	或翻彼相應恃舉為行或平等行，故知此意通染不染。	或翻彼相應恃舉為行或平等行，故知此意通染不染。	Or, it is called manas because it is the support of the mind, or because it is the support of the sameness of the mind. Therefore, manas is associated with both defiled and nondefiled mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a22_8']	若由論說阿羅漢位無染意故便無第七，應由論說阿羅漢位捨賴耶故便無第八。	若由論說阿羅漢位無染意故便無第七，應由論說阿羅漢位捨賴耶故便無第八。	If you claim that manas does not exist in the state of arhat because it is said in the treatises that manas is defiled, then you must also claim that the eighth consciousness does not exist in the state of arhat, because it is called the store consciousness .
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a23_1']	彼既不爾，此云何然？	彼既不爾，此云何然？	But since that is not so, how can you claim that manas does not exist in the state of arhat?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a23_15']	又諸論言，轉第七識得平等智。	又諸論言，轉第七識得平等智。	Also, the treatises say that the seventh consciousness is transformed into the knowledge of sameness .
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a25_10']	彼如餘智定有所依相應淨識，此識無者彼智應無，非離所依有能依故。	彼如餘智定有所依相應淨識，此識無者彼智應無，非離所依有能依故。	Since that knowledge, like other forms of knowledge, must have a pure, simultaneous, supporting consciousness, and since the eighth consciousness is not simultaneous with it, it must be that the seventh consciousness is transformed into the knowledge of sameness.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a26_11']	不可說彼依六轉識，許佛恒行如鏡智故。	不可說彼依六轉識，許佛恒行如鏡智故。	You cannot claim that this knowledge is supported by the six consciousnesses, because it is admitted that it occurs constantly, like mirror knowledge.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a27_13']	又無學位若無第七識，彼第八識應無俱有依；	又無學位若無第七識，彼第八識應無俱有依；	Also, if the state of arhat has no seventh consciousness, then the eighth consciousness will not have a simultaneous support,
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024a28_7']	然必有此依，如餘識性故。	然必有此依，如餘識性故。	but it must have such a support, because it is by nature like other forms of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b01_2']	又如未證補特伽羅無我者彼我執恒行，亦應未證法無我者法我執恒行。	又如未證補特伽羅無我者彼我執恒行，亦應未證法無我者法我執恒行。	Also, just as attachment to a self always occurs in one who has not yet realized the nonexistence of a personal self, so also attachment to a self of dharmas always occurs in one who has not yet realized the nonexistence of a self of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b01_12']	此識若無，彼依何識？	此識若無，彼依何識？	If this eighth consciousness does not exist, what consciousness do they depend on?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b02_2']	非依第八，彼無慧故。	非依第八，彼無慧故。	They cannot depend on the eighth consciousness, because it is devoid of discernment.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b03_11']	由此應信二乘聖道滅定無學此識恒行，彼未證得法無我故。	由此應信二乘聖道滅定無學此識恒行，彼未證得法無我故。	Therefore you must believe that in the two vehicles, the holy paths, samādhi of cessation, and the state of post-learners, this eighth consciousness always occurs, because they have not yet realized the nonexistence of a self of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b04_11']	又諸論中以五同法，證有第七為第六依。	又諸論中以五同法，證有第七為第六依。	Also, various treatises prove by means of five similarities that there is a seventh consciousness as support for the sixth.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b06_11']	聖道起時及無學位，若無第七為第六依，所立宗因便俱有失，或應五識亦有無依。	聖道起時及無學位，若無第七為第六依，所立宗因便俱有失，或應五識亦有無依。	If there is no seventh consciousness as a support for the sixth at the time of the holy paths and in the state of post-learner, then the thesis and reason are both faulty, or else the five consciousnesses must also be without support.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b08_2']	五恒有依，六亦應爾，是故定有無染污意，於上三位恒起現前。	五恒有依，六亦應爾，是故定有無染污意，於上三位恒起現前。	Since the five are always supported, the sixth must be also. Therefore there must be a defiled manas that always appears in these three states.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b09_14']	言彼無有者，依染意說，如說四位無阿賴耶，非無第八，此亦應爾。	言彼無有者，依染意說，如說四位無阿賴耶，非無第八，此亦應爾。	When it is said that it does not exist, it is said in terms of the defiled manas, just as it is said that the four states are without the ālaya, but not that the eighth consciousness is absent. This must be so.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b10_8']	此意差別略有三種：	此意差別略有三種：	This manas is distinguished in three ways:
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b11_14']	一補特伽羅我見相應、二法我見相應、三平等性智相應。	一補特伽羅我見相應、二法我見相應、三平等性智相應。	associated with the view of a personal self, associated with the view of a self of dharmas, and associated with the knowledge of sameness.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b13_17']	初通一切異生相續二乘有學、七地以前一類菩薩有漏心位，彼緣阿賴耶識起補特伽羅我見。	初通一切異生相續二乘有學、七地以前一類菩薩有漏心位，彼緣阿賴耶識起補特伽羅我見。	The first is associated with the mind streams of all ordinary beings, learners in the two vehicles, and the impure minds of the first seven bodhisattva stages. It takes as its object ālaya consciousness and produces the view of a personal self.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b15_17']	次通一切異生聲聞獨覺相續、一切菩薩法空智果不現前位，彼緣異熟識起法我見。	次通一切異生聲聞獨覺相續、一切菩薩法空智果不現前位，彼緣異熟識起法我見。	The second is associated with the mind streams of all ordinary beings, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas, and with all bodhisattvas when the fruit of knowledge of the emptiness of dharmas is not present. It takes as its object the consciousness that is retribution and produces the view of a self of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b18_3']	後通一切如來相續、菩薩見道及修道中法空智果現在前位，彼緣無垢異熟識等起平等性智。	後通一切如來相續、菩薩見道及修道中法空智果現在前位，彼緣無垢異熟識等起平等性智。	The third is associated with the mind streams of all Tathāgatas and with bodhisattvas on the path of insight and on the path of cultivation when the fruit of knowledge of the emptiness of dharmas is present. It takes as its object the pure consciousness that is retribution and produces the knowledge of sameness.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0024b20_5']	補特伽羅我見起位，彼法我見亦必現前，我執必依法執而起，如夜迷杌等方謂人等故。	補特伽羅我見起位，彼法我見亦必現前，我執必依法執而起，如夜迷杌等方謂人等故。	When the view of a personal self is present, the view of a self of dharmas must also be present, because the grasping of a self of persons arises in dependence on the grasping of a self of dharmas, just as the notion of a person arises when one mistakes a post for a person in the dark.

['ZH_T31_1585_005:0025b28_6']	若謂加行界地依等有差別者，理亦不然，彼差別因由此有故，此若無者彼因亦無，是故定應別有此意。	若謂加行界地依等有差別者，理亦不然，彼差別因由此有故，此若無者彼因亦無，是故定應別有此意。	If you say that there is a difference in their preparatory practices, stages, supports, etc., this is not reasonable, because the causes for their differences exist because of the existence of this manas. If this manas does not exist, neither do those causes. Therefore, this manas must exist separately.

If this manas did not exist, the attachment to a self would not exist. There is no place else where those who are bound by all the bonds do not have the attachment to a self for their entire lives. If they did not have the attachment to a self, they would be like those in nirvāṇa and would not be abhorred by sages and ordinary beings alike.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0025c04_14']	初後有故無如是失，中間長時無故有過。	初後有故無如是失，中間長時無故有過。	This error does not exist because the attachment to a self exists at the beginning and end of the lives of sentient beings in the samādhi of non-discrimination. The error does exist, however, because it does not exist for a long time in the middle.

Since the store consciousness does not exist, perfuming does not exist. We have already shown that other dharmas are not suitable for perfuming. Therefore there must exist a separate defiled manas that always gives rise to the grasping of a self in the mindless states. Consequently, the sages and saints all condemn and detest these mindless states.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0025c10_13']	又契經說，異生善染無記心時恒帶我執，若無此識彼不應有。	又契經說，異生善染無記心時恒帶我執，若無此識彼不應有。	A scripture says that when the minds of ordinary beings are good, defiled, or indeterminate, they are always accompanied by the grasping of a self. If this seventh consciousness did not exist, that would not be so.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0025c12_15']	謂異生類三性心時，雖外起諸業而內恒執我，由執我故令六識中所起施等不能亡相。	謂異生類三性心時，雖外起諸業而內恒執我，由執我故令六識中所起施等不能亡相。	That is, when the minds of ordinary beings are of the three natures good, defiled, or indeterminate, even though they manifest externally in the performance of actions, internally there is always a grasping of a self. Because of the grasping of a self, the acts of giving, etc., that are performed by the six consciousnesses are unable to transcend the characteristics of impurity.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0025c14_15']	故《瑜伽》說染污末那為識依止，彼未滅時相了別縛不得解脫，末那滅已相縛解脫。	故《瑜伽》說染污末那為識依止，彼未滅時相了別縛不得解脫，末那滅已相縛解脫。	Therefore the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that defiled manas is the support of the first six consciousnesses. As long as it has not disappeared, the bonds of the characteristics of grasped and grasper are not eliminated, but when manas disappears, the bonds of the characteristics are eliminated.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0025c16_15']	言相縛者，謂於境相不能了達如幻事等，由斯見分相分所拘不得自在故名相縛。	言相縛者，謂於境相不能了達如幻事等，由斯見分相分所拘不得自在故名相縛。	As for the bonds of the image, it means that one is unable to understand the image of an object as being like a magical creation, etc., and therefore the seeing part is bound by the image part and is not free.

It cannot be said that the good mind, etc., becomes impure because there is a separate possession that is not associated with the mind and occurs in a series. This is because it has already been proven that this possession does not really exist.

The word impure means born together with impurity.

Only then can they be impure. Consequently, they perfume and form the seeds of impure dharmas, and later, when they appear, the meaning of impurity is established.

Therefore, there is no craving at all for a neutral object. If one does not hope for a desirable object, craving does not arise.

When one desires to contemplate an object, there is hope for it. If one does not desire to contemplate, but the object is encountered by chance, then there is no desire at all. For this reason, desire is not a universal.

Many holy teachings say that attention appearing in the present can generate consciousness. Nowhere is it said that desire can generate mind and its activities.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0028b07_11']	如說諸法愛為根本，豈心心所皆由愛生？	如說諸法愛為根本，豈心心所皆由愛生？	It is said that all dharmas have craving as their root, but can it be said that mind and its activities are all born from craving?
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0028b10_2']	故說欲為諸法本者，說欲所起一切事業，或說善欲能發正勤，由彼助成一切善事，故論說此勤依為業。	故說欲為諸法本者，說欲所起一切事業，或說善欲能發正勤，由彼助成一切善事，故論說此勤依為業。	Therefore, when it is said that desire is the root of all dharmas, it means that all activities that are produced by desire. It may also mean that good desire can generate correct effort, and because it assists in the accomplishment of all good things, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that its activity is to make effort its support.

['ZH_T31_1585_005:0028b12_13']	謂邪正等教理證力，於所取境審決印持，由此異緣不能引轉。	謂邪正等教理證力，於所取境審決印持，由此異緣不能引轉。	That is, through the power of false or correct teachings, reasonings, or proofs, one firmly grasps and decides upon an object to be grasped, and for this reason other conditions cannot draw the mind away.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0028b14_4']	故猶豫境勝解全無，非審決心亦無勝解，由斯勝解非遍行攝。	故猶豫境勝解全無，非審決心亦無勝解，由斯勝解非遍行攝。	Therefore, where there is doubt, there is no resolve, and where the mind is not in a state of decision, there is no resolve. Consequently, resolve is not a universal.

['ZH_T31_1585_005:0028b28_7']	謂觀德失俱非境中，由定令心專注不散，依斯便有決擇智生。	謂觀德失俱非境中，由定令心專注不散，依斯便有決擇智生。	That is, in the case of a contemplated object that is either good, bad, or neither, samādhi causes the mind to concentrate on the object and not be distracted. Knowledge that makes distinctions arises in dependence on this concentration.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0028c01_7']	心專注言顯所欲住即便能住，非唯一境，不爾見道歷觀諸諦前後境別應無等持。	心專注言顯所欲住即便能住，非唯一境，不爾見道歷觀諸諦前後境別應無等持。	The phrase mind concentrated indicates that the mind is able to remain on the object as desired and is not limited to a single object. Otherwise, when the path of insight contemplates the four truths, the objects of the various moments would be different, and there would be no samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_005:0028c02_8']	若不繫心專注境位便無定起，故非遍行。	若不繫心專注境位便無定起，故非遍行。	If the mind is not concentrated on the object, samādhi does not occur, and therefore it is not a universal.

It is like mindfulness, discernment, etc., which are not the same as mind, because they are subsumed among the faculties, powers, factors of enlightenment, and factors of the path.

Also, because the five consciousnesses of a Buddha have as objects the three times, because the Tathāgata is never in a mindless samādhi, and because the five consciousnesses are all the knowledge that does things.
