['ZH_T31_1598_009:0434c15_10']	斷謂菩薩無住涅槃，以捨雜染、不捨生死二所依止轉依為相。	斷謂菩薩無住涅槃，以捨雜染、不捨生死二所依止轉依為相。	Abandonment refers to the bodhisattva's nirvāṇa without abiding, characterized by the transformation of the basis that abandons defilement and does not abandon saṃsāra.
['ZH_T31_1598_009:0434c16_5']	此中生死，謂依他起性雜染分。	此中生死，謂依他起性雜染分。	Here, saṃsāra refers to the defiled aspect of the nature of dependent arising.

Therefore, the excellence of abandonment is explained immediately after that.
['ZH_T31_1598_009:0434c21_12']	無住涅槃者，不同世間聲聞獨覺安住生死或涅槃故。	無住涅槃者，不同世間聲聞獨覺安住生死或涅槃故。	As for “nirvāṇa without abiding,” it is unlike the worldly śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who abide in saṃsāra or nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1598_009:0434c23_4']	以捨雜染不捨生死者，害彼勢力如彼呪蛇，雖不棄捨而無染故。	以捨雜染不捨生死者，害彼勢力如彼呪蛇，雖不棄捨而無染故。	As for “abandoning defilement but not abandoning saṃsāra,” it is like a spell that harms a snake, in that although one does not abandon it, one is not defiled by it.

['ZH_T31_1598_009:0434c26_15']	若依利他，由與大悲共相應故，現處生死而不棄捨。	若依利他，由與大悲共相應故，現處生死而不棄捨。	if it is for the benefit of others, because it is associated with great compassion, it manifests in saṃsāra and does not abandon it.

['ZH_T31_1598_009:0435a01_18']	涅槃謂依他起性清淨分者，謂畢竟轉遍計所執圓成實分。	涅槃謂依他起性清淨分者，謂畢竟轉遍計所執圓成實分。	Nirvana is the pure part of the dependent nature. This means that the perfected nature is the part that is the ultimate transformation of the discriminated nature.

['ZH_T31_1598_009:0435a15_7']	二通達轉，謂諸菩薩已入大地，於真實非真實、顯現不顯現，現前住故，乃至六地。	二通達轉，謂諸菩薩已入大地，於真實非真實、顯現不顯現，現前住故，乃至六地。	The second is the transformation of penetrating understanding, which means that bodhisattvas who have already entered the stages, in regard to the real and the unreal, the manifest and the unmanifest, abide in the present moment, up to the sixth stage.

['ZH_T31_1598_009:0435a25_9']	若諸菩薩住廣大轉，有何功德？	若諸菩薩住廣大轉，有何功德？	If bodhisattvas abide in the vast transformation, what merits are there?

Non-nature is precisely emptiness, and emptiness is precisely the perfected nature of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1598_009:0435c17_10']	由是於生死非捨非不捨等者，謂即生死是涅槃故說名非捨，無復生死名想轉故名非不捨。	由是於生死非捨非不捨等者，謂即生死是涅槃故說名非捨，無復生死名想轉故名非不捨。	As for therefore, regarding saṃsāra, it is neither abandoned nor not abandoned, it means that because saṃsāra itself is nirvāṇa, it is said to be neither abandoned. Because the conception of saṃsāra is transformed, it is called neither not abandoned.
