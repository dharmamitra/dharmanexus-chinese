['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c22_6']	諸方等教皆是不思議，何故此經獨受其名？	諸方等教皆是不思議，何故此經獨受其名？	003	All the teachings of the Vaipulya are inconceivable, why is this sutra alone given this name?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c22_8']	答：	答：	003	The answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c23_10']	一切諸經雖皆是不思議，但此經即以不思議為名。	一切諸經雖皆是不思議，但此經即以不思議為名。	003	Although all the sutras are inconceivable, this sutra takes the inconceivable as its name.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c24_11']	例如一切佛皆有法寶，而寶積佛即以為名。	例如一切佛皆有法寶，而寶積佛即以為名。	003	It is similar to all Buddhas having the Dharma Jewel, while the Buddha Ratnagarbha takes it as his name.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c25_1']	又不思議凡有二種：	又不思議凡有二種：	003	Moreover, the inconceivable generally has two kinds:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c26_9']	一者通不思議，謂諸佛菩薩境界，並非二乘凡夫之有所能測度；	一者通不思議，謂諸佛菩薩境界，並非二乘凡夫之有所能測度；	003	First, the general inconceivability, referring to the realms of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, which cannot be fathomed by those of the two vehicles or ordinary beings;
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c27_9']	二者別不思議，謂神通奇特，如巨細相容。	二者別不思議，謂神通奇特，如巨細相容。	003	Second, the specific inconceivability, referring to the marvelous and extraordinary spiritual powers, such as the large containing the small.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c28_13']	眾經多明通不思議，此經多辨別不思議，故偏受斯稱。	眾經多明通不思議，此經多辨別不思議，故偏受斯稱。	003	Many sūtras mainly elucidate the general inconceivability, while this sūtra mainly discusses the specific inconceivability, thus it is given this title.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0867c28_15']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a01_9']	此經凡有二名，一維摩詰、二不思議，何故別有〈不思議品〉而無別維摩品耶？	此經凡有二名，一維摩詰、二不思議，何故別有〈不思議品〉而無別維摩品耶？	003	This sūtra has two names, one is Vimalakīrti and the other is Inconceivable. Why is there a chapter on the inconceivable but not a separate chapter on Vimalakīrti?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a02_14']	又此經名不思議經，別有〈不思議品〉，眾經何故不爾？	又此經名不思議經，別有〈不思議品〉，眾經何故不爾？	003	Also, if this sūtra is called the Inconceivable Sūtra, and there is a chapter on the inconceivable, why is it not so for other sūtras?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a03_6']	如般若等經，何故無般若品耶？	如般若等經，何故無般若品耶？	003	For example, the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras, why are there no chapters on prajñā?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a03_8']	答：	答：	003	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a04_16']	此經雖有人法二名，而維摩事彰，通為一經之主，不須別立品。	此經雖有人法二名，而維摩事彰，通為一經之主，不須別立品。	003	Although this sūtra has names of both people and dharmas, the matter of Vimalakīrti is prominent, serving as the main theme of the entire sūtra, so there is no need to establish a separate chapter.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a05_18']	不思議雖通貫一經，但不思議事未顯，須別立品。	不思議雖通貫一經，但不思議事未顯，須別立品。	003	Although inconceivable pervades the entire sutra, the inconceivable events have not yet been revealed, so a separate chapter must be established.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a06_18']	般若等經明般若事顯，故不須別立般若品也。	般若等經明般若事顯，故不須別立般若品也。	003	The Prajna and other sutras clarify the events of prajna, so a separate prajna chapter is not necessary.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a07_1']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a07_11']	此經何故辨不思議耶？	此經何故辨不思議耶？	003	Why does this sutra discuss the inconceivable?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a07_13']	答：	答：	003	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a07_18']	略有五義。	略有五義。	003	There are roughly five meanings.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a09_12']	一者欲稱歎諸佛菩薩解脫法門不可思議，令稟教之徒虛心頂受、慕仰信行。	一者欲稱歎諸佛菩薩解脫法門不可思議，令稟教之徒虛心頂受、慕仰信行。	003	First, it wishes to praise the inconceivable liberation Dharma gate of buddhas and bodhisattvas, causing those who receive the teachings to respectfully accept them with an empty mind and admire and believe in the practice.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a11_7']	二者淨名道德已遠，得無功用心、現通說法，有所施為任運即不假思量議度。	二者淨名道德已遠，得無功用心、現通說法，有所施為任運即不假思量議度。	003	Second, Vimalakirti's virtue and path are already far-reaching. He attains the effortless mind and manifests spiritual powers and expounds the Dharma. In his actions, he naturally does not need to think or deliberate.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a12_3']	既得此悟，還欲示人，故說不思議。	既得此悟，還欲示人，故說不思議。	003	Having attained this realization, he still wishes to show it to others, so he speaks of the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a13_3', 'ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a13_16']	三者欲顯一切諸法無定性相，故說不思議。🔽如長若定長，不可促長令短；	三者欲顯一切諸法無定性相，故說不思議。 如長若定長，不可促長令短；	003	Third, it wishes to reveal that all dharmas have no fixed nature or characteristics, so it speaks of the inconceivable.🔽If long is definitely long, it cannot be shortened to make it short;
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a14_8']	短若定短，不可延短令長。	短若定短，不可延短令長。	003	if short is definitely short, it cannot be extended to make it long.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a14_19']	以可延促，故無定相性。	以可延促，故無定相性。	003	Because it can be extended or shortened, it has no fixed nature.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a16_2']	以無定性，諸法即空，因此即悟入實相，故說不思議。	以無定性，諸法即空，因此即悟入實相，故說不思議。	003	Because it has no fixed nature, all dharmas are empty. Based on this, one immediately realizes the true nature, and therefore it is said to be inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a17_1']	四者此經正明不思議法，故立不思議名。	四者此經正明不思議法，故立不思議名。	003	Fourth, this sūtra directly clarifies the inconceivable Dharma, and therefore it establishes the name inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a18_4']	如不二法門，心行處滅、言語道斷，淨名默即是其事。	如不二法門，心行處滅、言語道斷，淨名默即是其事。	003	Like the Dharma gate of non-duality, where the realm of mental activity ceases and the path of speech is cut off, the silence of Vimalakīrti is precisely this matter.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a18_16']	以正說此法，故辨不思議。	以正說此法，故辨不思議。	003	Because it directly expounds this Dharma, it distinguishes the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a19_13']	五者此經欲示二種人法，故明不思議。	五者此經欲示二種人法，故明不思議。	003	Fifth, this sūtra wishes to show the two kinds of people and dharmas, and therefore it clarifies the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a22_3']	一者理外，謂凡夫二乘及有所得大乘人法，若所行之境、能行之智、所說教門，皆是有所得顛倒，故非不思議；	一者理外，謂凡夫二乘及有所得大乘人法，若所行之境、能行之智、所說教門，皆是有所得顛倒，故非不思議；	003	First, those outside the principle, namely ordinary beings, the two vehicles, and those of the Mahāyāna who have attained something. If the objects they practice, the wisdom that practices, and the teachings they expound are all inverted and have attained something, then they are not inconceivable;
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a24_9']	二者明理內諸佛菩薩，所行之境、能行之智、所說教門，並絕凡夫二乘有所得境界，故方是不可思議。	二者明理內諸佛菩薩，所行之境、能行之智、所說教門，並絕凡夫二乘有所得境界，故方是不可思議。	003	Second, it clarifies that the realm of practice, the wisdom of practice, and the teachings expounded by the buddhas and bodhisattvas within the principle are all beyond the realm of attainment of ordinary beings and the two vehicles, and therefore they are inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a24_11']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a24_16']	何以知然？	何以知然？	003	How do we know this to be so?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a24_18']	答：	答：	003	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a26_16']	此經呵凡斥聖、破大彈小者，良由凡聖大小皆是有所得顛倒，理外行心，所以非不思議。	此經呵凡斥聖、破大彈小者，良由凡聖大小皆是有所得顛倒，理外行心，所以非不思議。	003	This sūtra rebukes ordinary beings and sages, refutes the great and criticizes the small, precisely because ordinary beings, sages, and the great and small all have inverted attainment and practice their minds outside the principle, and therefore they are not inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a28_5']	廣說菩薩無方妙用、無礙法門，有得之徒莫能測度，故名不思議。	廣說菩薩無方妙用、無礙法門，有得之徒莫能測度，故名不思議。	003	It extensively explains the bodhisattvas' marvelous functions without limits and the Dharma gates without obstruction, which those with attainment are unable to fathom, and therefore it is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868a29_2']	是故當知欲開二種義，故明不思議。	是故當知欲開二種義，故明不思議。	003	Therefore, you should know that in order to open up these two kinds of meanings, it clarifies the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b01_6']	此是對可思議，故歎不思議，令捨可思議、悟不思議。	此是對可思議，故歎不思議，令捨可思議、悟不思議。	003	This is in contrast to the conceivable, and therefore it praises the inconceivable, causing one to abandon the conceivable and realize the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b02_15']	既無可思議亦無不思議，故諸佛菩薩所行之道，非思議非不思議。	既無可思議亦無不思議，故諸佛菩薩所行之道，非思議非不思議。	003	Since there is nothing conceivable, there is also no inconceivable, and therefore the path practiced by the buddhas and bodhisattvas is neither conceivable nor inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b02_17']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b04_13']	理外義宗，亦明絕四句、離百非，言語道斷、心行處滅，何故非不思議、無所得？	理外義宗，亦明絕四句、離百非，言語道斷、心行處滅，何故非不思議、無所得？	003	The doctrinal tenets outside the truth also clarify transcending the four propositions and leaving behind the hundred negations, where language is cut off and the mind's activity ceases. Why are they not inconceivable and not attained?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b05_10']	若四句、若絕四句，一切諸法皆不思議？	若四句、若絕四句，一切諸法皆不思議？	003	If it is the four propositions or transcending the four propositions, are all dharmas inconceivable?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b05_12']	答：	答：	003	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b06_5']	有所得，絕定絕，不可令不絕；	有所得，絕定絕，不可令不絕；	003	With attainment, transcending is definitely transcending, and it cannot be made not to transcend;
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b06_17']	不絕定不絕，不可令其絕。	不絕定不絕，不可令其絕。	003	not transcending is definitely not transcending, and it cannot be made to transcend.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b07_14']	如此絕不絕，皆有蹤迹處所可得思議。	如此絕不絕，皆有蹤迹處所可得思議。	003	In this way, transcending and not transcending both have traces and locations that can be conceived.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b08_11']	無所得，絕不絕並是因緣無礙不思議。	無所得，絕不絕並是因緣無礙不思議。	003	Without attainment, transcending and not transcending are both unobstructed and inconceivable due to causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b09_18']	又有所得，絕不絕悉皆不成、竟無此法，論何物不思議耶？	又有所得，絕不絕悉皆不成、竟無此法，論何物不思議耶？	003	Moreover, with attainment, transcending and not transcending are all ultimately not established, and there is no such dharma at all. What object is inconceivable?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b10_17']	無所得，絕不絕義始成，故方得有不思議。	無所得，絕不絕義始成，故方得有不思議。	003	Without attainment, the meaning of transcending and not transcending is only established, and only then can there be inconceivability.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b11_6']	至二智中當具說也。	至二智中當具說也。	003	It will be fully explained in the section on the two knowledges.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b11_26']	2 釋不思議名第二、釋不思議名略有三義：	2 釋不思議名第二、釋不思議名略有三義：	003	2. Explaining the Name of Inconceivability The second is explaining the name of inconceivability. There are three main points:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b12_9']	一者約本釋不思議名。	一者約本釋不思議名。	003	First, using the basis to explain the name of inconceivability.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b13_6']	由本是不思議故，方有不思議用耳。	由本是不思議故，方有不思議用耳。	003	Because the basis is inconceivable, there is only the inconceivable function.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b15_2']	不思議本即不二法門，不二法門謂諸法實相，諸法實相心行斷故，心不能思；	不思議本即不二法門，不二法門謂諸法實相，諸法實相心行斷故，心不能思；	003	The basis of inconceivability is precisely the gate of non-duality. The gate of non-duality refers to the true aspect of all dharmas. Because the activity of the mind is cut off in the true aspect of all dharmas, the mind cannot conceive of it;
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b15_12']	言語滅故，口不能議。	言語滅故，口不能議。	003	Because language ceases, the mouth cannot discuss it.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b17_19']	十四章經正為開不二，故前序云「淨名現病之本意、文殊問病之所由，當知為明本不思議，故名不思議也。	十四章經正為開不二，故前序云「淨名現病之本意、文殊問病之所由，當知為明本不思議，故名不思議也。	003	The fourteen chapters of the sūtra are precisely for revealing non-duality. Therefore, the preface says, The fundamental intention of Vimalakīrti's illness and Mañjuśrī's inquiry into the cause of the illness should be known to clarify the fundamental inconceivability, therefore it is called inconceivability.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b18_7']	」二者約淨名二智。	」二者約淨名二智。	003	Second, using Vimalakīrti's two kinds of wisdom.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b19_2']	由體不二之道，故有不二之智。	由體不二之道，故有不二之智。	003	Because of the non-dual path of essence, there is the wisdom of non-duality.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b21_1']	不二之智能適化無方、善巧妙用，並任運成就無功用心，不假思量議度，故名不思議。	不二之智能適化無方、善巧妙用，並任運成就無功用心，不假思量議度，故名不思議。	003	The wisdom of non-duality can adapt to transformation without direction, skillfully and wonderfully used, all accomplished spontaneously without effort, not relying on thought or deliberation, therefore it is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b22_8']	三者外示不思議跡。	三者外示不思議跡。	003	Third, externally demonstrating inconceivable traces.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b24_10']	若形若聲及說不思議本，若境若智，並非下位菩薩及與二乘凡夫所能測度，故名不思議。	若形若聲及說不思議本，若境若智，並非下位菩薩及與二乘凡夫所能測度，故名不思議。	003	Whether it is form, sound, or speaking of the inconceivable basis, whether it is the realm or wisdom, they are all not something that bodhisattvas of lower levels, the two vehicles, or ordinary beings can fathom, therefore it is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b25_10']	不思議體，但有於三不思議名，亦唯此三義。	不思議體，但有於三不思議名，亦唯此三義。	003	The substance of the inconceivable only has the three names of the inconceivable, and also only these three meanings.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b25_12']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b26_1']	此與關中舊釋何異？	此與關中舊釋何異？	003	How is this different from the old explanations in Guanzhong?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b26_3']	答：	答：	003	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b27_11']	肇公云「深遠幽微，二乘不能測」，謂不思議三義之中但是後意耳。	肇公云「深遠幽微，二乘不能測」，謂不思議三義之中但是後意耳。	003	Zhaozhou said, Profound and far-reaching, the two vehicles cannot fathom it, which is only the latter meaning among the three meanings of the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b28_5']	生公云「不思議者凡有二種：	生公云「不思議者凡有二種：	003	Shengzhao said, The inconceivable is of two kinds:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b28_16']	一者空理，非惑情所測；	一者空理，非惑情所測；	003	First, the principle of emptiness, which cannot be fathomed by deluded emotions;
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868b29_18']	二者神奇，非淺識能知」，三意之中具說初二義。	二者神奇，非淺識能知」，三意之中具說初二義。	003	Second, it is a spiritual wonder, not something that shallow knowledge can understand. Among the three meanings, it fully explains the first two meanings.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c02_11']	什公云「法身菩薩有所施為，欲能則能，不須作意」，三種之中亦得其一。	什公云「法身菩薩有所施為，欲能則能，不須作意」，三種之中亦得其一。	003	Master Kumārajīva said, Bodhisattvas of the Dharma body have something they do. If they wish to do it, they can do it without needing to make an effort. Among the three kinds, one can also obtain one of them.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c03_14']	今且敘三門，復辨本末次第及內外不同，則抱前諸意。	今且敘三門，復辨本末次第及內外不同，則抱前諸意。	003	Now, I will first describe three approaches, and then distinguish the sequence of the fundamental and the derivative, and the differences between the internal and the external, thus embracing the previous meanings.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c04_2']	三、辨不思議體。	三、辨不思議體。	003	Third, distinguishing the essence of the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c04_4']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c04_13']	今就何法明不思議？	今就何法明不思議？	003	Now, based on what dharma does one clarify the inconceivable?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c04_15']	答：	答：	003	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c05_4']	法雖無量，略有三種：	法雖無量，略有三種：	003	Although the dharmas are innumerable, there are roughly three kinds:
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c05_14']	一境、二智、三教門。	一境、二智、三教門。	003	First, objects, second, wisdom, and third, the teaching.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c07_1']	境即真俗二境不思議，智即權實兩智不思議，教謂二諦教門。	境即真俗二境不思議，智即權實兩智不思議，教謂二諦教門。	003	The objects refer to the inconceivable two objects of truth and convention. Wisdom refers to the inconceivable two wisdoms of provisional and real. The teaching refers to the teaching of the two truths.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c07_12']	此之三門，有二種次第。	此之三門，有二種次第。	003	These three approaches have two kinds of sequences.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0868c09_2']	若據能化，由真俗二境發權實兩智，由權實兩智故外說二諦教門。	若據能化，由真俗二境發權實兩智，由權實兩智故外說二諦教門。	003	If based on the ability to transform, it is because the two objects of truth and convention give rise to the two wisdoms of provisional and real. It is because of the two wisdoms of provisional and real that the teaching of the two truths is expounded externally.

['ZH_T38_1780_003:0871b04_6']	菩薩法空，自性空、自相空，即空為有、即有為空。	菩薩法空，自性空、自相空，即空為有、即有為空。	003	The bodhisattvas' emptiness of dharmas is the emptiness of intrinsic nature and the emptiness of intrinsic characteristics. Emptiness itself is existence, and existence itself is emptiness.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0871b05_3']	故二乘法空可思議，菩薩法空不思議。	故二乘法空可思議，菩薩法空不思議。	003	Therefore, the emptiness of dharmas of the two vehicles is conceivable, but the emptiness of dharmas of the bodhisattvas is inconceivable.

['ZH_T38_1780_003:0871b11_7']	菩薩能別相知一切法，謂麁細大小淺深，然後知其是空，故空廣大。	菩薩能別相知一切法，謂麁細大小淺深，然後知其是空，故空廣大。	003	Bodhisattvas can individually know all dharmas, coarse and fine, large and small, shallow and deep, and then know them to be empty, so emptiness is vast.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0871b12_10']	又二乘但得三界內人法空，故約有明空，空義即短。	又二乘但得三界內人法空，故約有明空，空義即短。	003	Moreover, the Two Vehicles only attain the emptiness of persons and dharmas within the three realms, so the emptiness of existence is short.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0871b13_15']	菩薩知三界內人外人法皆空，故約有明空，空義即長。	菩薩知三界內人外人法皆空，故約有明空，空義即長。	003	Bodhisattvas know that both persons and dharmas within and outside the three realms are empty, so the emptiness of existence is long.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0871b14_8']	故二乘得小分空，猶如兔馬。	故二乘得小分空，猶如兔馬。	003	Therefore, the Two Vehicles attain a small portion of emptiness, like a rabbit or a horse.

Existence is not empty, so it does not exist; emptiness is not existent, so it is not empty. Emptiness is clearly present and yet existent; existence is clearly present and yet empty.

Such unobstructed causes and conditions of emptiness and existence are only practiced by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and are therefore called inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0871c11_8']	上來明三境三智不思議竟。	上來明三境三智不思議竟。	003	The above clarifies the inconceivability of the three objects and three wisdoms.

Without the objective realm, there is no way to clarify wisdom; without wisdom, there is no way to discern the objective realm. Therefore, the objective realm is called the realm of wisdom, and wisdom is called the wisdom of the objective realm. The objective realm is not wisdom, and wisdom is not the objective realm. Neither the objective realm nor wisdom can be fully described.

['ZH_T38_1780_003:0872a13_7']	第三、通別不思議者，然大乘經通皆是不思議，如肇公云「始自淨國說乎法供養，其文雖殊，不思議一也。	第三、通別不思議者，然大乘經通皆是不思議，如肇公云「始自淨國說乎法供養，其文雖殊，不思議一也。	003	Third, as for the general and specific inconceivability, the Mahayana sutras are all inconceivable in general. As Master Sengzhao said, Starting from the Pure Land, speaking of the Dharma offerings, although the texts are different, the inconceivability is the same.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0872a15_2']	」故若境若智、若權若實，因之與果、依之與正，皆是諸佛菩薩法門，絕二乘境界。	」故若境若智、若權若實，因之與果、依之與正，皆是諸佛菩薩法門，絕二乘境界。	003	Therefore, whether it is the realm or wisdom, the provisional or the real, the cause or the effect, the dependent or the correct, they are all the Dharma gates of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, beyond the realm of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0872a16_9']	所以然者，理內無依無得、無有彰礙，不出不動、如幻如化。	所以然者，理內無依無得、無有彰礙，不出不動、如幻如化。	003	The reason for this is that within the principle, there is no reliance, no attainment, no obstruction, no going out, no movement, like an illusion, like a transformation.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0872a19_2']	凡夫二乘有所得學大乘人，皆是理外，聞有作有解、聞無起作無心，故不能思量佛菩薩舉足動出之事，況染妙道耶？	凡夫二乘有所得學大乘人，皆是理外，聞有作有解、聞無起作無心，故不能思量佛菩薩舉足動出之事，況染妙道耶？	003	Ordinary beings, the two vehicles, and those who have attained something in learning the Mahayana, are all outside the principle. Hearing of existence, they give rise to understanding of existence; hearing of nonexistence, they give rise to the mind of nonexistence. Therefore, they are unable to contemplate the events of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas raising their feet and moving, let alone being tainted by the wonderful path?
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0872a19_11']	故通皆是不思議也。	故通皆是不思議也。	003	Therefore, in general, they are all inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0872a21_18']	別不思議者，雖通唱不思議，恐凡夫二乘有所得人不肯信受，謂諸佛菩薩有言無事，故別示其不思議迹。	別不思議者，雖通唱不思議，恐凡夫二乘有所得人不肯信受，謂諸佛菩薩有言無事，故別示其不思議迹。	003	As for the separate inconceivable, although the inconceivable is generally proclaimed, it is feared that ordinary people and those of the two vehicles who grasp at things will not believe or accept it, thinking that buddhas and bodhisattvas have words but no substance, so the separate traces of the inconceivable are specifically shown.
['ZH_T38_1780_003:0872a23_7']	如高廣之座入於小室，小室宛然廣博，就事而觀，淵不可測。	如高廣之座入於小室，小室宛然廣博，就事而觀，淵不可測。	003	It is like a high and wide seat entering a small room, and the small room is still vast, observing from the perspective of phenomena, it is unfathomable.
