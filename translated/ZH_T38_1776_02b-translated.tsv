How does the mind of equanimity, which turns away from transforming, benefit others? There are four meanings in the explanation.
['ZH_T38_1776_02b:0467b18_6']	第一義者，向前三心雖有益物而未能得，故須修捨，捨前所緣自修能究竟，故須修捨。	第一義者，向前三心雖有益物而未能得，故須修捨，捨前所緣自修能究竟，故須修捨。	02b	The first meaning is that although the first three minds have benefits for beings, they are still unable to attain them, so equanimity must be cultivated. Letting go of the previously focused objects, one cultivates oneself to the ultimate, so equanimity must be cultivated.
['ZH_T38_1776_02b:0467b19_4']	捨前所為更修勝善，方能究竟利益眾生。	捨前所為更修勝善，方能究竟利益眾生。	02b	Abandoning what was previously done and cultivating superior wholesome [actions] again, one is then able to ultimately benefit sentient beings.

Compassion is to remove suffering for oneself and others, joy is to rejoice in others' attainment of happiness for oneself and others, and equanimity is to be impartial towards oneself and others. Because they are connected to and arise from the previous three, they are called benefiting others.
['ZH_T38_1776_02b:0467b22_1']	第四義者，捨前所益更化餘人，故名利他。	第四義者，捨前所益更化餘人，故名利他。	02b	The fourth meaning is to abandon those previously benefited and transform others instead, thus it is called benefiting others.

['ZH_T38_1776_02b:0467c02_12']	」於中別分，初之二種為眾生，中間二種偏為實際，後之二種偏為菩提。	」於中別分，初之二種為眾生，中間二種偏為實際，後之二種偏為菩提。	02b	Among them, the first two are for sentient beings, the middle two are biased towards ultimate reality, and the last two are biased towards bodhi.
['ZH_T38_1776_02b:0467c04_12']	如此說文中說言「以攝慳貪起檀波羅蜜，以化犯戒起尸波羅蜜」，故知初二偏為眾生。	如此說文中說言「以攝慳貪起檀波羅蜜，以化犯戒起尸波羅蜜」，故知初二偏為眾生。	02b	As explained in the text, Using giving to attract greed and give rise to the pāramitā of giving, using transformation to violate precepts and give rise to the pāramitā of morality, therefore it is known that the first two are biased towards sentient beings.
