The Buddha, with the power of his original vows and compassion for sentient beings, should attain enlightenment in the world. Because the Buddha's body manifests the Buddha, the body is therefore beyond the world.
['ZH_T35_1732_02a:0037b13_15']	若約一乘時，此閻浮處即一心法界境界，若佛若處俱顯處染無穢之最佛，故顯在此方成道也。	若約一乘時，此閻浮處即一心法界境界，若佛若處俱顯處染無穢之最佛，故顯在此方成道也。	02a	If we discuss the time according to the One Vehicle, this place of Jambudvīpa is the realm of the Dharma realm of one mind. Whether it is the Buddha or the place, they both show the most defiled place without defilement. Therefore, it is shown that he attains enlightenment in this region.
