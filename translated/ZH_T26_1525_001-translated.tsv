Therefore, they mistakenly grasp the view of eternalism, etc., which can accumulate karmic causes, and the characteristics of various afflictions rely on each other to increase and grow in the world. Because they firmly grasp and determine the causes of the world, they are apart from the view of true reality, and because they lack the mind to benefit others, they are attached to worldly pleasures.

Although they do not grasp the merits of giving and so forth, they are also not apart from the merits of giving and so forth, and are able to subdue afflictions and attain the supreme Dharma.

Demonstrating the four phrases of profound mind and so forth, they are able to embrace the four phrases of giving and so forth. For bodhisattvas, these are not the same dharmas, and they are able to attain omniscience. For this reason, the Tathāgata expounds this sūtra.

They abandon their own happiness and, in order to benefit all sentient beings, cultivate the wholesome roots and merits of giving and so forth, all of which they dedicate towards the wisdom of omniscience. They are free from all the evil paths of the māras. Therefore, it is said that when practicing the bodhisattva path, they subdue all the māras and enemies.
