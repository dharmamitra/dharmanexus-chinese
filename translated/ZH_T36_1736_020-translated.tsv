['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b15_8']	先釋總顯，自有二義：	先釋總顯，自有二義：	First, explaining revealing in general has two meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b15_14']	一望前為總。	一望前為總。	First, looking at it from the previous section, it is general.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b18_1']	前四十眾各隨所宜以顯勝德，所顯則局，如顯海神，云「佛功德海充滿其身」等，今總顯四十眾德。	前四十眾各隨所宜以顯勝德，所顯則局，如顯海神，云「佛功德海充滿其身」等，今總顯四十眾德。	In the previous forty groups, each according to their suitability reveals their superior virtues. What is revealed is limited, like revealing the sea gods, saying the ocean of the Buddha's merits fills their bodies and so on. Now it reveals the virtues of the forty groups in general.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b18_7']	二望後為總。	二望後為總。	Second, looking at it from the following section, it is general.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b19_3']	下四十眾得法各異，今總顯具德。	下四十眾得法各異，今總顯具德。	In the following forty groups, each attains the Dharma differently. Now it reveals in general that they are endowed with virtues.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b19_16']	從「前同生」下，躡跡成難。	從「前同生」下，躡跡成難。	From the previous same life below, it follows the traces to form a difficulty.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b20_1']	謂有難云：	謂有難云：	It means there is a difficulty:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b21_4']	前顯同生，云皆與毘盧遮那共集善根，豈非總耶？	前顯同生，云皆與毘盧遮那共集善根，豈非總耶？	The previous revelation of the same life says they all gathered wholesome roots with Vairocana. Isn't that already general?
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b21_9']	故今答云：	故今答云：	Therefore, the answer now is:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b22_8']	前局同生，今該同異，四十眾德方得名總。	前局同生，今該同異，四十眾德方得名總。	The previous section is limited to the same life, while now it encompasses the same and different. The virtues of the forty groups can only be called general.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b23_16']	又前明共集，下重通所難，非唯總別不等，實亦文意有殊。	又前明共集，下重通所難，非唯總別不等，實亦文意有殊。	Moreover, the previous clarifies the gathering together. Below, it further responds to the difficulty. Not only are the general and specific unequal, but the meaning of the text is also different.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b24_12']	前云共集，與佛德齊，故為主伴；	前云共集，與佛德齊，故為主伴；	Previously it was said that they gathered together and were equal to the Buddha's virtues, so they were the main and the companions;
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b25_7']	今曾攝受，唯為佛攝，故為眷屬。	今曾攝受，唯為佛攝，故為眷屬。	Now they have been accepted, and are only accepted by the Buddha, so they are the retinue.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b26_16']	為分二義，前略攝受，此略共集，可互影取，故云「影略其文」。	為分二義，前略攝受，此略共集，可互影取，故云「影略其文」。	In order to distinguish the two meanings, the previous brief acceptance and this brief gathering can be taken by mutual implication, so it is said that the text is abbreviated.

['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b28_16']	於中三：	於中三：	There are three parts to this:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151b29_13']	初科為三、二「初後是因」下科揀。	初科為三、二「初後是因」下科揀。	The first part is divided into three, and the second part is distinguished below the beginning and end are the causes.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c01_9']	三「又初段」下對前且字，今為二故久攝。	三「又初段」下對前且字，今為二故久攝。	The third part is below The first section, which is in response to the word for now above. Now it is divided into two, so it has been accepted for a long time.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c01_20']	「今見」下，亦是科揀。	「今見」下，亦是科揀。	Now seeing is also a distinction in the analysis.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c02_7']	上三分中，二即是緣。	上三分中，二即是緣。	Among the three parts above, the second is the conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c03_4']	初後是因者，約自行為因、佛攝為緣。	初後是因者，約自行為因、佛攝為緣。	As for the beginning and end are the causes, taking one's own practice as the cause and the Buddha's acceptance as the conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c03_19']	今得見佛，由昔曾攝，攝即親因。	今得見佛，由昔曾攝，攝即親因。	Now that I have attained to see the Buddha, it is due to being once embraced by him in the past. Embracing is the direct cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c04_13']	因緣既著為感，昔既曾攝故應。	因緣既著為感，昔既曾攝故應。	Since the causes and conditions are evident, it is the response. Since I was once embraced in the past, I should respond.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c05_20']	疏「言一切者，謂分別俱生、若種若現」者，謂二障各二：	疏「言一切者，謂分別俱生、若種若現」者，謂二障各二：	The commentary says all refers to discrimination and innate, seeds and manifestations. This means the two hindrances each have two aspects:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c07_10']	一者分別，謂因邪師邪教及邪思惟，此見道斷，入初地時便永斷盡。	一者分別，謂因邪師邪教及邪思惟，此見道斷，入初地時便永斷盡。	The first is discrimination, which is caused by wrong teachers, wrong teachings, and wrong thoughts. This is eliminated by the path of seeing and is completely eliminated upon entering the first ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c08_16']	二者俱生，不由上二，生而便有，此修道斷，地地斷之。	二者俱生，不由上二，生而便有，此修道斷，地地斷之。	The second is innate, which arises without the above two causes. This is eliminated by the path of cultivation and is eliminated ground by ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c09_1']	此又二種：	此又二種：	This is also of two kinds:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c09_11']	一者現行、二者種子。	一者現行、二者種子。	The first is manifest activity, and the second is seeds.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c10_1']	若所知現行，地地斷之。	若所知現行，地地斷之。	If the manifest activity of the knowable is eliminated ground by ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c10_12']	若煩惱現行，亦地地斷。	若煩惱現行，亦地地斷。	If the manifest activity of afflictions is also eliminated ground by ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c11_3']	煩惱種子，直至金剛定斷。	煩惱種子，直至金剛定斷。	The seeds of afflictions are eliminated up to the adamantine concentration.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c12_15']	疏「二障氣分麁重麁重」者，二障氣分即熏習所成，揀異現障故云習氣。	疏「二障氣分麁重麁重」者，二障氣分即熏習所成，揀異現障故云習氣。	The text says the coarse and heavy nature of the two hindrances - the coarse and heavy nature of the two hindrances is that which is formed by perfuming, distinguishing it from the present hindrances, thus it is called habitual tendencies.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c13_8']	然習氣有二，謂因與果。	然習氣有二，謂因與果。	However, there are two kinds of habitual tendencies, namely causal and resultant.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c14_3']	於現起障能為因者，亦名種子。	於現起障能為因者，亦名種子。	That which can be the cause for the present arising of hindrances is also called seeds.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c15_8']	此因習氣根本智斷，斷此因已現不起故，不起現因。	此因習氣根本智斷，斷此因已現不起故，不起現因。	This causal habitual tendency is eliminated by fundamental wisdom. Having eliminated this cause, the present [hindrances] do not arise, thus it is called the non-arising of the present cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c16_16']	但麁重者，唯名習氣，此果習氣後得智斷，斷現麁重知現無故。	但麁重者，唯名習氣，此果習氣後得智斷，斷現麁重知現無故。	As for the mere coarse and heavy nature, it is only called habitual tendencies. This resultant habitual tendency is eliminated by subsequently attained wisdom. Having eliminated the present coarse and heavy nature, one knows that the present [hindrances] do not exist.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c17_8']	言麁重者，違細輕故。	言麁重者，違細輕故。	As for the coarse and heavy nature, it is contrary to that which is subtle and light.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c17_14']	然麁重有三：	然麁重有三：	There are three kinds of coarse and heavy nature:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c18_14']	一現起麁重，貪瞋癡等令行者心無堪任故。	一現起麁重，貪瞋癡等令行者心無堪任故。	First, the coarse and heavy nature of present arising, such as greed, anger, and delusion, which make the practitioner's mind incapable of bearing [the truth].
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c19_11']	二種子麁重，煩惱種子障諸智故。	二種子麁重，煩惱種子障諸智故。	Second, the coarse and heavy nature of seeds, which obstructs various wisdoms due to the seeds of afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c21_1']	三麁重麁重，實非煩惱似煩惱故，如身子瞋習、畢陵慢習等。	三麁重麁重，實非煩惱似煩惱故，如身子瞋習、畢陵慢習等。	Third, the coarse and heavy nature of the coarse and heavy nature, which is actually not an affliction but resembles an affliction, such as Śāriputra's habitual anger and Pilin's habitual arrogance, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c21_18']	今即第三，以經言餘習故，又位極故。	今即第三，以經言餘習故，又位極故。	Now, the third is because the sutra speaks of remaining habits and because the stage is ultimate.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c22_18']	前二即是一切中攝，故疏釋云「若種若現」。	前二即是一切中攝，故疏釋云「若種若現」。	The first two are included in all, so the commentary explains them as seeds or manifestations.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c24_1']	上言已斷，即有能斷之道，揀異伏道，故云已斷。	上言已斷，即有能斷之道，揀異伏道，故云已斷。	The above statement of having already eliminated refers to the path that can eliminate, distinguishing it from the path of suppression, so it says already eliminated.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c26_1']	斷道有二，謂一根本無分別智，親證二空所顯真理，無境相故，能斷二障種子現行。	斷道有二，謂一根本無分別智，親證二空所顯真理，無境相故，能斷二障種子現行。	The path of elimination has two aspects: First, the fundamental non-discriminating cognition directly realizes the truth manifested by the two kinds of emptiness, without the appearance of objects, and is able to eliminate the seeds and actual manifestations of the two hindrances.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c28_16']	二後得無分別智，雖不親證，無力能斷迷理隨眠，而於安立非安立相明了現前無倒證故，亦能永斷彼修所斷迷事隨眠。	二後得無分別智，雖不親證，無力能斷迷理隨眠，而於安立非安立相明了現前無倒證故，亦能永斷彼修所斷迷事隨眠。	Second, the subsequent non-discriminating cognition, although not directly realizing and lacking the power to eliminate the dormant afflictions that are confused about the principle, clearly manifests in the characteristics of the established and unestablished, and is able to permanently eliminate the dormant afflictions that are confused about phenomena and are to be eliminated during cultivation.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0151c29_9']	上來皆是《唯識論》意。	上來皆是《唯識論》意。	All of the above are the meaning of the Vijñaptimātratā-śāstra.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a01_3']	更有釋者，所知障中亦有二種：	更有釋者，所知障中亦有二種：	There is another explanation: The obstacle to that which is to be known also has two kinds:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a02_7']	一於所知境而能為障，即是不染污無知而非法執。	一於所知境而能為障，即是不染污無知而非法執。	The first is that which obstructs the known objects, namely the undefiled ignorance, which is not the grasping of dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a03_11']	如於五明處有所未解，但是無知，何曾有執。	如於五明處有所未解，但是無知，何曾有執。	If one has not yet understood something in the five fields of learning, it is simply ignorance, how could it be grasping?
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a04_6']	然《唯識》云「由我法執，二障俱生。	然《唯識》云「由我法執，二障俱生。	However, the Vijñaptimātratā says: Due to the grasping of self and dharmas, the two hindrances arise together.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a05_14']	若證二空彼障隨斷者，據見道分別障說，以證空理而斷障故。	若證二空彼障隨斷者，據見道分別障說，以證空理而斷障故。	If one realizes the two kinds of emptiness, those hindrances are eliminated according to their arising. This is said in terms of the path of insight and the hindrance of discrimination, because by realizing the principle of emptiness one eliminates the hindrances.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a07_5']	言是障而非執者，據修道斷俱生障說，以遍知有成種智故。	言是障而非執者，據修道斷俱生障說，以遍知有成種智故。	As for saying it is a hindrance but not grasping, this is said in terms of the path of cultivation and the elimination of the innate hindrances, because by thoroughly knowing existence one attains the wisdom of the tathāgatas.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a07_13']	」上來所知之障。	」上來所知之障。	The above is the hindrance to the knowable.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a08_4']	二所知即障，名所知障。	二所知即障，名所知障。	Second, the knowable itself is the hindrance, named the hindrance to the knowable.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a09_12']	此體即是善心心所，以彼空有二相未除，帶相觀心有所得故。	此體即是善心心所，以彼空有二相未除，帶相觀心有所得故。	The essence of this is the wholesome mind and mental factors, because the two aspects of emptiness and existence have not yet been eliminated, and the mind that contemplates with characteristics has something to attain.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a10_9']	前據了俗，此據證真，說名智障。	前據了俗，此據證真，說名智障。	The previous [hindrance] is based on understanding the conventional, while this [hindrance] is based on realizing the true, and is called the hindrance to wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a10_18']	此障對治亦有二種：	此障對治亦有二種：	There are also two kinds of antidotes to this hindrance:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a11_18']	一者解有、二者達空，空有俱明名遍知故。	一者解有、二者達空，空有俱明名遍知故。	First, understanding existence, second, penetrating emptiness, the clear understanding of both emptiness and existence is called omniscience.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a12_13']	然《唯識》正義，唯所知之障。	然《唯識》正義，唯所知之障。	However, the correct meaning of the Vijñaptimātratā is only the obstacle to that which is to be known.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a13_1']	今就理通，故亦用之。	今就理通，故亦用之。	Now, from the perspective of principle, it is also used.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a13_3']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a14_2']	永斷習氣唯是如來，云何此亦皆云已斷？	永斷習氣唯是如來，云何此亦皆云已斷？	The complete elimination of habitual tendencies is only for the Tathāgata. Why is it said here that they have all been eliminated?
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a14_4']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a14_9']	此有二釋。	此有二釋。	There are two explanations for this.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a15_3']	一約法相，全分離盡，唯是如來。	一約法相，全分離盡，唯是如來。	First, from the perspective of dharmas, complete separation and elimination is only for the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a15_13']	若據分離，亦通菩薩。	若據分離，亦通菩薩。	If it is based on separation, it is also common to bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a16_8']	以經中說三種麁重，三位斷故。	以經中說三種麁重，三位斷故。	Because the sūtras say there are three kinds of coarseness, eliminated in three stages.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a16_19']	《解深密經》說三麁重：	《解深密經》說三麁重：	The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra speaks of three kinds of coarseness:
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a17_7']	一者在皮，初地即斷；	一者在皮，初地即斷；	First, in the skin, eliminated in the first ground;
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a17_17']	二者在膚，八地方斷；	二者在膚，八地方斷；	Second, in the flesh, eliminated in the eighth ground;
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a18_7']	三者在骨，唯佛地斷。	三者在骨，唯佛地斷。	Third, in the bones, only eliminated in the Buddha ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a19_16']	雖則餘位亦斷麁重，而三位顯，是故偏說初地，捨凡入聖位故。	雖則餘位亦斷麁重，而三位顯，是故偏說初地，捨凡入聖位故。	Although the other stages also eliminate coarseness, the three stages are prominent, and therefore it is said that in the first ground, one abandons the stage of ordinary beings and enters the holy stage.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a20_15']	八地無漏常相續故，佛地果滿頓得捨故。	八地無漏常相續故，佛地果滿頓得捨故。	Because the eighth ground is always uninterrupted by the uncontaminated [mind], and because the Buddha ground is fully attained and suddenly abandoned.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a21_11']	又此即是八地菩薩，故云斷也。	又此即是八地菩薩，故云斷也。	Moreover, this is precisely the bodhisattva of the eighth ground, therefore it is said to be severed.
['ZH_T36_1736_020:0152a22_2']	二約圓融，如疏文顯。	二約圓融，如疏文顯。	Second, in terms of perfect interfusion, as shown in the commentary.
