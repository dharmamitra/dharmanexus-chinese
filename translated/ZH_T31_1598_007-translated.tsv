['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419a26_1']	如是已說入所知相，彼入因果云何可見？	如是已說入所知相，彼入因果云何可見？	Thus, the characteristics of the knowable that are to be entered have been explained. How can their entry, causes, and effects be seen?
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419a27_1']	謂由施、戒、忍、精進、靜慮、般若六種波羅蜜多。	謂由施、戒、忍、精進、靜慮、般若六種波羅蜜多。	It is said that it is due to the six perfections of giving, morality, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419a27_14']	云何由六波羅蜜多得入唯識？	云何由六波羅蜜多得入唯識？	How does one enter into consciousness-only through the six perfections?
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419a28_8']	復云何六波羅蜜多成彼入果？	復云何六波羅蜜多成彼入果？	Moreover, how do the six perfections become the fruits of that entry?
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b02_5']	謂此菩薩不著財位，不犯尸羅，於苦無動，於修無懈，於如是等散動因中不現行時心專一境，便能如理簡擇諸法得入唯識。	謂此菩薩不著財位，不犯尸羅，於苦無動，於修無懈，於如是等散動因中不現行時心專一境，便能如理簡擇諸法得入唯識。	It is said that when this bodhisattva is not attached to wealth and status, does not violate morality, is unmoved by suffering, is not lax in cultivation, and does not engage in the causes of distraction such as these, the mind becomes focused on a single object and is able to discern phenomena in accordance with principle and enter into consciousness-only.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b03_16']	菩薩依六波羅蜜多入唯識已，證得六種清淨增上意樂所攝波羅蜜多。	菩薩依六波羅蜜多入唯識已，證得六種清淨增上意樂所攝波羅蜜多。	Having entered into consciousness-only by relying on the six perfections, the bodhisattva realizes the perfections that are subsumed by the six kinds of pure superior intention.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b07_4']	是故於此設離六種波羅蜜多現起加行，由於聖教得勝解故，及由愛重隨喜欣樂諸作意故，恒常無間相應方便修習六種波羅蜜多速得圓滿。	是故於此設離六種波羅蜜多現起加行，由於聖教得勝解故，及由愛重隨喜欣樂諸作意故，恒常無間相應方便修習六種波羅蜜多速得圓滿。	Therefore, even if one is separated from the six perfections in one's present practice, by gaining understanding of the holy teachings and by loving, rejoicing, and delighting in all practices, one always constantly and uninterruptedly practices the six perfections with appropriate skillful means, and they are quickly perfected.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b07_7']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b08_11']	入唯識因，謂加行時世間六種波羅蜜多，今當顯示。	入唯識因，謂加行時世間六種波羅蜜多，今當顯示。	The causes for entering into cognition-only, namely the worldly six perfections during the stage of added effort, will now be explained.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b10_19']	謂此菩薩不著財位者，無所貪求故名不著貪著，即是捨所對治，此即是施波羅蜜多所對治障，後五亦爾。	謂此菩薩不著財位者，無所貪求故名不著貪著，即是捨所對治，此即是施波羅蜜多所對治障，後五亦爾。	It is said that this bodhisattva is not attached to wealth and status. Because he is not greedy, he is called not attached. Attachment is the opposite of giving, and this is the obstacle to the perfection of giving. The same is true for the following five.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b11_18', 'ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b12_18']	不犯尸羅者，毀犯是戒波羅蜜多所對治障。🔽於苦無動者，忿動是忍波羅蜜多所對治障。	不犯尸羅者，毀犯是戒波羅蜜多所對治障。 於苦無動者，忿動是忍波羅蜜多所對治障。	Not violating morality means not breaking the precepts, which is the obstacle to the perfection of morality.🔽Not being moved by suffering means not being agitated by anger, which is the obstacle to the perfection of patience.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b13_18']	於修無懈者，懈是精進波羅蜜多所對治障。	於修無懈者，懈是精進波羅蜜多所對治障。	Not being lazy in practice means not being lazy, which is the obstacle to the perfection of vigor.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b15_14']	心專一境者，謂於靜慮波羅蜜多所對治障散動因中，遠離不轉，持心令定。	心專一境者，謂於靜慮波羅蜜多所對治障散動因中，遠離不轉，持心令定。	The mind is concentrated on a single object means that in the causes of distraction that are the counteragents to the perfection of meditative concentration, one is not unmoved, and one holds the mind to be concentrated.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b16_13']	便能如理簡擇諸法者，即是般若波羅蜜多。	便能如理簡擇諸法者，即是般若波羅蜜多。	One is then able to discern phenomena in accordance with principle is precisely the perfection of wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b18_14']	由此六種波羅蜜多得入唯識，既得入已證得清淨增上意樂所攝殊勝果分六種波羅蜜多。	由此六種波羅蜜多得入唯識，既得入已證得清淨增上意樂所攝殊勝果分六種波羅蜜多。	Through these six perfections one enters into consciousness only. Having already entered, one realizes the six kinds of perfections that are included in the pure superior intention and are the excellent fruit.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b20_12']	是故設離波羅蜜多現起加行，恒常無間修習六種波羅蜜多速得圓滿，為不爾耶？	是故設離波羅蜜多現起加行，恒常無間修習六種波羅蜜多速得圓滿，為不爾耶？	Therefore, even if one sets aside the actual practice of the perfections, if one always constantly and uninterruptedly cultivates the six perfections, will they quickly be perfected or not?
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b21_11']	若於尸羅波羅蜜多不起加行，應是犯戒。	若於尸羅波羅蜜多不起加行，應是犯戒。	If one does not perform the practice of the perfection of morality, one should be one who violates the precepts.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b22_4']	此義不然，不起勉勵加行故。	此義不然，不起勉勵加行故。	This is not so, because one does not make the effort to practice.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b23_11']	若於尸羅不起加行應有此失，非不發起勉勵加行而有此失。	若於尸羅不起加行應有此失，非不發起勉勵加行而有此失。	If one does not perform the practice of morality, one should have this fault. It is not that one has this fault without making the effort to practice.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b24_11']	由於聖教得勝解等任運加行，是故無失。	由於聖教得勝解等任運加行，是故無失。	Because they spontaneously engage in practice based on their superior understanding of the holy teachings, there is no fault.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b26_3']	此中於聖教得勝解者，謂於波羅蜜多相應聖教，雖極甚深而能信解。	此中於聖教得勝解者，謂於波羅蜜多相應聖教，雖極甚深而能信解。	Here, those who have attained superior understanding of the holy teachings are those who, although the holy teachings associated with the perfections are extremely profound, are able to believe and understand them.
['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419b27_3']	愛重作意者，謂於已得波羅蜜多受功德味。	愛重作意者，謂於已得波羅蜜多受功德味。	The attitude of cherishing means to experience the flavor of the virtues of the perfections that one has already attained.

['ZH_T31_1598_007:0419c01_6']	欣樂作意者，謂於未來，願我與此恒不相離及轉殊勝。	欣樂作意者，謂於未來，願我與此恒不相離及轉殊勝。	The attitude of delight means to wish in the future that oneself and these [perfections] will always be inseparable and will become more and more excellent.
