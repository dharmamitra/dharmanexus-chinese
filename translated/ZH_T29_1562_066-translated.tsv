['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b10_17']	由何等道離何地染？	由何等道離何地染？	066	By what kind of path can one be separated from the defilements of what stage?

['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b11_13']	有頂由無漏，　　餘由二離染。	有頂由無漏，　　餘由二離染。	066	The peak of existence is separated by the undefiled, the rest are separated by the two.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b12_2']	論曰：	論曰：	066	Discussion:
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b13_6']	有頂地中所有煩惱，唯無漏道能令永離，定非有漏。	有頂地中所有煩惱，唯無漏道能令永離，定非有漏。	066	As for the afflictions in the stage of the peak of existence, only the undefiled path can cause them to be permanently separated, it definitely is not the one with outflows.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b13_11']	所以者何？	所以者何？	066	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b13_20']	唯此力能治上地故。	唯此力能治上地故。	066	Only this power can treat the higher stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b14_17']	唯於次上近分地中，起世俗道治下地惑。	唯於次上近分地中，起世俗道治下地惑。	066	Only in the immediately higher stage of neighboring concentration does the worldly path arise to treat the afflictions of the lower stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b15_16']	有頂地惑既無上地，故無有漏能離彼染。	有頂地惑既無上地，故無有漏能離彼染。	066	The afflictions of the stage of the peak of existence have no higher stage, therefore there is no outflow that can separate from the defilements of that.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b16_17']	何緣世俗道不治自地惑，是自隨眠所隨增故。	何緣世俗道不治自地惑，是自隨眠所隨增故。	066	Why does the worldly path not eliminate the passions of its own stage? Because the passions of that stage increase in power when that path is present.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b18_6']	非彼隨眠所隨增事，應有勢用治彼隨眠，以順生長彼煩惱故。	非彼隨眠所隨增事，應有勢用治彼隨眠，以順生長彼煩惱故。	066	When a path does not increase the power of the passions, it can oppose the passions and eliminate them.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b19_14']	若有勢用能治彼者，此必非彼之所隨增，以緣此時彼損減故。	若有勢用能治彼者，此必非彼之所隨增，以緣此時彼損減故。	066	If a path has the power to eliminate the passions, then the passions do not increase in power when that path is present.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b20_13']	何緣下地起世俗道，不能對治上地隨眠？	何緣下地起世俗道，不能對治上地隨眠？	066	Why does the worldly path of a lower stage not eliminate the passions of a higher stage?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b23_1']	非彼隨眠所隨增故，不順生長彼煩惱故，應許能治上地隨眠，上地定非下地世俗厭行斷道所緣境故。	非彼隨眠所隨增故，不順生長彼煩惱故，應許能治上地隨眠，上地定非下地世俗厭行斷道所緣境故。	066	Because the passions of the higher stage do not increase in power when the lower path is present. It does not accord with the increase of the passions. It must be admitted that it can eliminate the passions of a higher stage, because the higher stage is not the object of the path of contemplation of the lower stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b23_19']	非厭下地能離上染，上地望下極微妙故。	非厭下地能離上染，上地望下極微妙故。	066	One cannot eliminate the passions of a higher stage by despising the lower stage, because the higher stage is extremely subtle in comparison with the lower.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b24_18']	由此證知，唯無漏力能離有頂，其理善成。	由此證知，唯無漏力能離有頂，其理善成。	066	Consequently, it is proven by this that only the power of the pure path can eliminate the passions of the peak of existence. The reason is sound.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b26_6']	餘八地中所有煩惱，通由二道能令永離，世出世道俱能離故。	餘八地中所有煩惱，通由二道能令永離，世出世道俱能離故。	066	The remaining eight stages are all abandoned by both the mundane and supramundane paths, because the afflictions of the remaining eight stages are all abandoned by both the mundane and supramundane paths.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b27_5']	既通由二離八地染，各有幾種離繫得耶？	既通由二離八地染，各有幾種離繫得耶？	066	Since the remaining eight stages are abandoned by both the mundane and supramundane paths, how many kinds of bonds are there in each?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b27_8']	頌曰：	頌曰：	066	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b28_13']	聖二離八修，　　各二離繫得。	聖二離八修，　　各二離繫得。	066	The noble ones abandon the eight stages by two paths, each with two bonds.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701b29_2']	論曰：	論曰：	066	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c02_8']	諸有學聖用有漏道離下八地修斷染時，能具引生二離繫得，有漏無漏二種斷道於八地中所作同故。	諸有學聖用有漏道離下八地修斷染時，能具引生二離繫得，有漏無漏二種斷道於八地中所作同故。	066	When the noble ones who are learners use the impure path to abandon the defilements of the lower eight stages that are to be abandoned by cultivation, they are able to fully produce two bonds of separation. This is because the impure and pure paths that are produced in the eight stages have the same function.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c03_7']	用無漏道離彼亦然，亦以於中所作同故。	用無漏道離彼亦然，亦以於中所作同故。	066	When they use the pure path to abandon them, it is also like this. This is because the pure path that is produced in the eight stages has the same function.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c04_15']	由此有學離八修斷世出世道隨一現前，各未來修世出世道。	由此有學離八修斷世出世道隨一現前，各未來修世出世道。	066	Therefore, when the learners abandon the eight stages that are to be abandoned by cultivation, whether the mundane or supramundane path is present, they each cultivate the mundane and supramundane paths in the future.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c08_2']	既說聖者二離八修各能引生二離繫得，准知聖者離有頂修及見斷時，用無漏道唯引無漏離繫得生，亦不未來修世俗道，與世俗道不同事故。	既說聖者二離八修各能引生二離繫得，准知聖者離有頂修及見斷時，用無漏道唯引無漏離繫得生，亦不未來修世俗道，與世俗道不同事故。	066	Since it is said that the noble one, in the two liberations and the eight cultivations, each can induce the arising of two types of disjunction acquisitions, it should be understood that when the noble one is free from the peak of existence and cultivating the path of insight, using the pure path, he only induces the arising of pure disjunction acquisitions. He also does not cultivate the mundane path in the future, because the pure and mundane paths are not the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c09_19']	異生離八用有漏道，唯引有漏離繫得生，亦不未來修無漏道，未入聖故不說自成。	異生離八用有漏道，唯引有漏離繫得生，亦不未來修無漏道，未入聖故不說自成。	066	When ordinary beings are free from the eight stages, using the contaminated path, they only induce the arising of contaminated disjunction acquisitions. They also do not cultivate the pure path in the future, because they have not yet entered the noble path. It is not necessary to explain this, as it is understood.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c10_4']	有餘師言：	有餘師言：	066	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c11_9']	以無漏道離下八地修斷染時，何緣知亦生有漏離繫得？	以無漏道離下八地修斷染時，何緣知亦生有漏離繫得？	066	When one is free from the contaminants to be eliminated by cultivation in the lower eight stages using the pure path, how can one know that one also produces contaminated disjunction acquisitions?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c12_2']	有捨無漏得煩惱不成故。	有捨無漏得煩惱不成故。	066	Because if one abandons the pure acquisitions, the contaminants will not be eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c16_6']	謂有學聖以無漏道離彼染時，若不引生同治有漏離繫得者，則以聖道具離八地，後依靜慮得轉根時，頓捨先來諸鈍聖道，唯得靜慮利果聖道，上惑離繫應皆不成，是即還應成彼煩惱。	謂有學聖以無漏道離彼染時，若不引生同治有漏離繫得者，則以聖道具離八地，後依靜慮得轉根時，頓捨先來諸鈍聖道，唯得靜慮利果聖道，上惑離繫應皆不成，是即還應成彼煩惱。	066	When the noble one who is still in training uses the uncontaminated path to eliminate the passions of the lower stages, if he does not generate the contaminated acquisition of separation that is simultaneously eliminated with the path, then he would eliminate the passions of the eight stages by means of the holy path, and later, when he relies on the realm of form to transform his faculties, he would suddenly abandon the former holy path of dull faculties and would only obtain the holy path of sharp faculties of the realm of form. The acquisition of separation from the passions of the upper stages would all be incomplete, and he would then fall back into the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c18_4']	然非所許，是故定知諸有學聖以無漏道離下八地修斷染時，亦具引生二離繫得。	然非所許，是故定知諸有學聖以無漏道離下八地修斷染時，亦具引生二離繫得。	066	But this is not admitted, and therefore we know with certainty that when the noble one who is still in training uses the uncontaminated path to eliminate the passions of the lower eight stages that are eliminated by cultivation, he also generates the two kinds of acquisitions of separation.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c18_9']	此證非理。	此證非理。	066	This proof is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c18_14']	所以者何？	所以者何？	066	Why is it unreasonable?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c20_13']	彼聖設無有漏斷得，亦不成就上地煩惱，如分離有頂得轉根時，及異生上生不成惑故。	彼聖設無有漏斷得，亦不成就上地煩惱，如分離有頂得轉根時，及異生上生不成惑故。	066	Even though that noble one does not have the contaminated acquisition of elimination, he still does not possess the passions of the upper stages, because when he is separated from the peak of existence and transforms his faculties, and because the ordinary beings who are born in the upper stages do not possess the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c23_2']	謂如分離有頂地染，後依靜慮得轉根時，無漏斷得既已頓捨，彼地離繫無有漏得，而彼地惑亦不成就。	謂如分離有頂地染，後依靜慮得轉根時，無漏斷得既已頓捨，彼地離繫無有漏得，而彼地惑亦不成就。	066	That is, when one who has already separated from the contaminant of the peak of existence later, on the basis of the realm of form, transforms his faculties, he suddenly abandons the acquisition of separation from the obstacle of the realm of formlessness, and the pure acquisition of separation from the obstacle of the peak of existence does not exist. However, one does not possess the obstacle of the peak of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c26_14']	又如異生生二定等，雖捨欲界等煩惱斷得，而不成就欲界等煩惱，以欲界等有漏離繫得初定等攝，唯彼能治故，若生上地此得必捨，生上地必捨下有漏善故。	又如異生生二定等，雖捨欲界等煩惱斷得，而不成就欲界等煩惱，以欲界等有漏離繫得初定等攝，唯彼能治故，若生上地此得必捨，生上地必捨下有漏善故。	066	Also, it is like the case of ordinary beings born in the second meditative absorption, etc., who, although they abandon the acquisition of separation from the passions of the realm of desire, etc., do not possess the passions of the realm of desire, etc., because the acquisition of separation from the obstacle of the realm of desire, etc., is categorized as the first meditative absorption, etc., and is only able to eliminate them. If one is born in a higher stage, this acquisition is necessarily abandoned, because one necessarily abandons the impure good of a lower stage when born in a higher stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c27_13']	此二雖無煩惱斷得，而勝進故遮惑得生；	此二雖無煩惱斷得，而勝進故遮惑得生；	066	Even though these two kinds of beings do not have the acquisition of separation from the passions, they are able to prevent the arising of the passions because they are superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c28_3']	彼亦應然，故證非理。	彼亦應然，故證非理。	066	This is also the case with the two kinds of beings mentioned above, and therefore your proof is not reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0701c28_12']	由此但可作如是言：	由此但可作如是言：	066	Consequently, we can only say the following.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a01_1']	二道於中所作同故，隨一現起引二得生，不可說言為成斷故。	二道於中所作同故，隨一現起引二得生，不可說言為成斷故。	066	The two paths are the same in their function in this matter, and when one of them is present, it causes the other to arise. It cannot be said that they are in order to perfect the acquisition of separation from the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a02_1']	已辯離染由道不同，今次應辯由地差別。	已辯離染由道不同，今次應辯由地差別。	066	Having discussed the differences in the paths of detachment, we now must discuss the differences in the stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a02_10']	由何地道離何地染？	由何地道離何地染？	066	By what stages and paths can one detach from what stages?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a02_13']	頌曰：	頌曰：	066	The treatise states:
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a03_0']	無漏未至道，　　能離一切地，	無漏未至道，　　能離一切地，	066	The pure path of non-entry can detach from all stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a04_13']	餘八離自上，　　有漏離次下。	餘八離自上，　　有漏離次下。	066	The remaining eight detach from themselves and above. The contaminated detach from the next lower.

['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a06_5']	諸無漏道通依九地，謂四靜慮、未至、中間及三無色。	諸無漏道通依九地，謂四靜慮、未至、中間及三無色。	066	All pure paths are based on nine stages, namely the four meditations, the preliminary concentration, the intermediate concentration, and the three formless attainments.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a08_16']	若未至攝能離欲界乃至有頂，餘八地攝隨其所應，各能離自及上地染不能離下，未離下時上道必無現在前故。	若未至攝能離欲界乃至有頂，餘八地攝隨其所應，各能離自及上地染不能離下，未離下時上道必無現在前故。	066	If they are included in the preliminary concentration, they can detach from the desire realm up to the peak of existence. The remaining eight stages, as appropriate, can each detach from themselves and higher stages. They cannot detach from lower stages, because when one has not yet detached from lower stages, the higher path will definitely not be present.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a10_15']	諸有漏道一切唯能離次下地，非自地等自地煩惱所隨增故，勢力劣故，先已離故。	諸有漏道一切唯能離次下地，非自地等自地煩惱所隨增故，勢力劣故，先已離故。	066	All contaminated paths can only detach from the next lower stage, not from themselves or higher stages, because the afflictions of one's own stage increase, one's power is inferior, and one has already detached from them.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a11_4']	諸依近分離下地染。	諸依近分離下地染。	066	Those who rely on the preliminary concentration to detach from the afflictions of lower stages.

['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a17_17']	所離有九，謂欲八定初三近分離下三染，第九解脫現在前時，或入根本或即近分。	所離有九，謂欲八定初三近分離下三染，第九解脫現在前時，或入根本或即近分。	066	There are nine that are separated from [defilements], namely the desire [realm] and the eight concentrations. The first three preliminary stages separate from the three defilements of the lower [realms]. When the ninth liberation is present, one either enters the fundamental [stage] or remains in the preliminary stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a19_15']	上五近分各離下染，第九解脫現在前時，必入根本非即近分，近分根本等捨根故。	上五近分各離下染，第九解脫現在前時，必入根本非即近分，近分根本等捨根故。	066	The upper five preliminary stages each separate from the defilements of the lower [realms]. When the ninth liberation is present, one necessarily enters the fundamental [stage] and does not remain in the preliminary stage, because the preliminary stage and the fundamental stage have different faculties of equanimity.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a21_4']	下三靜慮近分、根本受根異故，有不能入、轉入異受少艱難故。	下三靜慮近分、根本受根異故，有不能入、轉入異受少艱難故。	066	Because the faculties of the preliminary stages and the fundamental stages of the lower three meditations are different, some are unable to enter and transform into different faculties, because there is a slight difficulty.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0702a22_3']	離下染時必欣上故，若受無異必入根本。	離下染時必欣上故，若受無異必入根本。	066	When one is free from the passions of a lower stage, one necessarily delights in the higher stage. If one does not experience a difference, one necessarily enters the fundamental stage.

When realization is complete, one attains the fruit of non-return. It is not that one who has not yet separated from desire for the desire realm attains the fruit of non-return when realization is complete. Therefore, the worldly path can actually sever afflictions.

It is not the case that what has already been severed is severed again, therefore the cited scripture is not established as evidence.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c04_15']	此亦不然，此經意顯爾時唯得不還果故。	此亦不然，此經意顯爾時唯得不還果故。	066	This is also not so, because this scripture shows that at that time one only attains the fruit of non-returner.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c05_14']	謂諸漸次得不還者，爾時必斷五結無餘。	謂諸漸次得不還者，爾時必斷五結無餘。	066	That is, when one gradually becomes anāgāmin, at that time he necessarily eliminates the five lower bonds without remainder.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c07_3']	為令了知先離欲者入諦現觀唯得不還，故說爾時斷五下結。	為令了知先離欲者入諦現觀唯得不還，故說爾時斷五下結。	066	In order to make it understood that one who has previously detached from desire and enters into the realization of the truths only becomes anāgāmin, it is said that at that time he eliminates the five lower bonds.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c08_2']	此言意說便能斷盡，非謂今時能總斷五。	此言意說便能斷盡，非謂今時能總斷五。	066	The meaning of these words is that he is able to completely eliminate them, not that he is now able to completely eliminate the five.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c11_10']	理必應爾，以見道力不能無餘斷貪瞋結，要無餘斷方證不還，由此定知先離欲者已能實斷二下分結，為顯彼見諦唯證不還故，說彼今時斷五下結。	理必應爾，以見道力不能無餘斷貪瞋結，要無餘斷方證不還，由此定知先離欲者已能實斷二下分結，為顯彼見諦唯證不還故，說彼今時斷五下結。	066	Reason necessarily must be so, because the power of the path of seeing cannot completely eliminate the bonds of craving and hatred. One must completely eliminate them in order to realize anāgāmin. For this reason, it is definitely known that one who has previously detached from desire has already been able to truly eliminate the two lower bonds. In order to show that he who sees the truths only realizes anāgāmin, it is said that he now eliminates the five lower bonds.

['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c16_13']	謂雖先斷貪瞋二結，而同世俗說今便斷，如王至此久離所從，而假說今從何來等。	謂雖先斷貪瞋二結，而同世俗說今便斷，如王至此久離所從，而假說今從何來等。	066	That is, although one has previously eliminated the two fetters of craving and hatred, one is said to eliminate them now in accordance with worldly convention, just as when a king arrives at a place, although he has long been separated from his retinue, he says hypothetically, “Where did they come from?”
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c18_11']	或彼三結入現觀時，所有離繫得無漏得，貪瞋二結得永不生，故說爾時斷五無失。	或彼三結入現觀時，所有離繫得無漏得，貪瞋二結得永不生，故說爾時斷五無失。	066	Or, when the three fetters enter into the path of insight, the acquisition of separation from the fetters and the acquisition of pure liberation from the two fetters of craving and hatred are forever unarisen, and for that reason it is said that at that time one eliminates five fetters without error.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c21_1']	若謂雖說得第四定，後入現觀得不還果，而不定說斷伏下地，如何定知彼下地惑皆已實斷得，非唯伏現纏？	若謂雖說得第四定，後入現觀得不還果，而不定說斷伏下地，如何定知彼下地惑皆已實斷得，非唯伏現纏？	066	If it is said that although it is said that one acquires the fourth trance state and later enters the path of insight and acquires the fruit of nonreturner, it is not definitely said that one eliminates or subdues the lower stages, how do you know with certainty that one has really eliminated the lower stages and does not merely subdue the bonds of the lower stages?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c21_15']	此不應疑，以此經說得不還故。	此不應疑，以此經說得不還故。	066	This should not be doubted, because this scripture says that one acquires the fruit of nonreturner.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c22_9']	不可說言後漸方得，先已破故。	不可說言後漸方得，先已破故。	066	It cannot be said that one gradually acquires it later, because that has already been refuted.

['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c24_7']	謂唯能伏下地煩惱便生上地，非所極成；	謂唯能伏下地煩惱便生上地，非所極成；	066	That is, one is only able to subdue the passions of the lower stages and be born in the upper stages, but this is not universally accepted.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c25_14']	唯能實斷下地煩惱便生上地是所極成，故於此中不應猶豫。	唯能實斷下地煩惱便生上地是所極成，故於此中不應猶豫。	066	It is well known that one can be born in a higher stage only by actually eliminating the passions of the lower stage. Therefore, one should not doubt this.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c26_14']	如是名為有教證故，知世俗道亦能斷惑。	如是名為有教證故，知世俗道亦能斷惑。	066	This is called the teaching of the scriptures. It is known that the mundane path can also eliminate passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0704c29_12']	言有理者，謂煩惱力能繫縛自身令界地別，故若欲界惑得未實斷，有能往生色無色界，則諸煩惱應無功能縛界地生令有差別。	言有理者，謂煩惱力能繫縛自身令界地別，故若欲界惑得未實斷，有能往生色無色界，則諸煩惱應無功能縛界地生令有差別。	066	The second reason is that if the passions of the realm of desire have not been actually eliminated, and one is able to be born in the realms of form and of the formless, then the passions would be powerless to bind one to the realms of form and of the formless and cause one to be born there.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a03_10']	若謂未伏下地煩惱必不生上是彼功能，此亦不然，雖伏此地所有煩惱亦生此故，謂有能伏有頂煩惱，然復得生有頂地故。	若謂未伏下地煩惱必不生上是彼功能，此亦不然，雖伏此地所有煩惱亦生此故，謂有能伏有頂煩惱，然復得生有頂地故。	066	If it is claimed that if the passions of a lower stage have not been subdued, one cannot be born in a higher stage, and this is the function of the passions, this is not so, because even though one may subdue the passions of a certain stage, one can still be born there. That is, one may subdue the passions of the summit of existence, but one can still be born in the stage of the summit of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a05_12']	然依自地起世俗道，亦能制伏自地煩惱，如不淨觀持息念等，亦伏自地現行煩惱，斷煩惱得。	然依自地起世俗道，亦能制伏自地煩惱，如不淨觀持息念等，亦伏自地現行煩惱，斷煩惱得。	066	However, one can also subdue the passions of a certain stage by means of the mundane path of that stage, just as the contemplation of impurity, mindfulness of breathing, etc., can also subdue the actual passions of a certain stage and eliminate the possession of those passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a07_14']	要於此地諸煩惱中得解脫道，制伏煩惱令暫不行，工巧、威儀亦有此力，況善心起而無功能？	要於此地諸煩惱中得解脫道，制伏煩惱令暫不行，工巧、威儀亦有此力，況善心起而無功能？	066	One must attain the path of liberation from the afflictions of this stage, subduing the afflictions and causing them not to temporarily occur. Even in skillful and dignified deportment, one has this power. How much more so when a wholesome mind arises, which has no power?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a09_5']	如住此間能伏八地所有煩惱令不現行，於有頂何緣獨不能制伏？	如住此間能伏八地所有煩惱令不現行，於有頂何緣獨不能制伏？	066	Just as one dwelling here can subdue the afflictions of the eight stages and prevent them from occurring, why can one not alone subdue the afflictions of the peak of existence?
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a09_14']	彼定應許如是理趣。	彼定應許如是理趣。	066	They must certainly admit this principle.

['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a13_1']	故住此間必於有頂有伏煩惱善方便智。	故住此間必於有頂有伏煩惱善方便智。	066	Therefore, dwelling here, one must have the skillful wisdom that subdues the afflictions of the peak of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a15_16']	既不可說不斷有頂諸煩惱得唯由伏彼煩惱現行便不生彼，於下八地例亦應然，由此定知諸世俗道亦斷煩惱，其理極成。	既不可說不斷有頂諸煩惱得唯由伏彼煩惱現行便不生彼，於下八地例亦應然，由此定知諸世俗道亦斷煩惱，其理極成。	066	Since one cannot say that one does not cut off the afflictions of the peak of existence, but only by subduing the manifestation of those afflictions does one not give rise to them there, it should be the same for the lower eight stages. For this reason, one definitely knows that the worldly path also cuts off afflictions, and the principle is extremely established.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a16_17']	又應諸預流得生無色故，若伏下地即得上生。	又應諸預流得生無色故，若伏下地即得上生。	066	Also, all stream-enterers would obtain rebirth in the formless realm, and if they subdued the lower stages, they would be able to be reborn in the higher stages.

At the completion of clear realization, they should attain the fruit of stream-entry, not the fruit of non-returner, because it is admitted that they are bound by all the proclivities of the three realms, and because the path of seeing is not their antidote for elimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_066:0705a20_13']	彼住果位若致命終，決定應許生無色界，下二界惑先已伏故。	彼住果位若致命終，決定應許生無色界，下二界惑先已伏故。	066	If they remain in the state of the fruit and then die, it is definitely admitted that they will be reborn in the formless realm, because the proclivities of the two lower realms have already been subdued.
