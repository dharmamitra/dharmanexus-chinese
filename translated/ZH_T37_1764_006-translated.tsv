Now, based on one aspect, eleven are discussed. The first ten are the emptiness of characteristics, and the last one is the emptiness of truth. In the dharmas grasped by false emotions, the meaning of emptiness is clarified, which is called the emptiness of characteristics. In true consciousness, the meaning of emptiness is discussed, which is called the emptiness of truth.

All dharmas are the true mind. The essence of the true mind is tranquil, so the latter kind is based on wisdom to speak of emptiness.

The ninth uses existence to dispel non-existence as emptiness. The tenth uses the non-existence and non-non-existence to both refute existence and non-existence, which is named emptiness.

['ZH_T37_1764_006:0757b20_3']	二就觀行始終分別，凡夫本來謂內有我，故先觀內，內未不得謂外有之，故復觀外。	二就觀行始終分別，凡夫本來謂內有我，故先觀內，內未不得謂外有之，故復觀外。	Second, distinguishing based on the beginning and end of the practice of contemplation, ordinary beings originally consider there to be a self internally, so one first contemplates internally. Not yet attaining internally, one considers it to exist externally, so one then contemplates externally.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0757b21_16']	向者觀內不及其外，觀外之時復不及內，於此二中猶疑有我，故須合觀。	向者觀內不及其外，觀外之時復不及內，於此二中猶疑有我，故須合觀。	Previously, contemplating internally did not reach the external, when contemplating the external, it again did not reach the internal. Still doubting the existence of a self within these two, one therefore needs to contemplate in combination.

Therefore, followers of the two vehicles can only generally understand suffering, etc., but cannot understand them individually. Only bodhisattvas can understand them distinctly.

['ZH_T37_1764_006:0757c05_7']	無為法中，無我、我所名無為空，是中亦未空其法體。	無為法中，無我、我所名無為空，是中亦未空其法體。	Within unconditioned dharmas, the absence of self and what belongs to self is called the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, but here too it does not yet empty the essence of phenomena.

Therefore, the third is the general contemplation of internal and external conditioned and unconditioned dharmas.

Emptiness without beginning is no different from the previous five kinds of emptiness, but it is called emptiness without beginning because one contemplates the previous five kinds of emptiness in the past.

Therefore, in the Bodhisattvabhūmi, one contemplates the three times together. But now, in order to clarify that dharmas of the past are the fundamental cause of arising afflictions, and the place of attachment since beginningless time, one must contemplate them.

['ZH_T37_1764_006:0758c24_21']	向前六空之中並簡如來、法、僧、佛性，此性空中何故不然？	向前六空之中並簡如來、法、僧、佛性，此性空中何故不然？	In the previous six kinds of emptiness, the Tathāgata, Dharma, Saṃgha, and Buddha-nature are all distinguished. Why is it not so in this emptiness of nature?
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0758c25_2']	釋言：	釋言：	The explanation is:
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0758c26_14']	今此通就報果常、樂、我、淨以明性空，常樂我淨是佛、法、僧，所以不簡。	今此通就報果常、樂、我、淨以明性空，常樂我淨是佛、法、僧，所以不簡。	Now, this passage generally clarifies the emptiness of nature in terms of the eternal, blissful, self, and pure fruition of recompense. Eternal, blissful, self, and pure refer to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, so it does not distinguish them.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0758c27_17']	又，佛常、樂、我、淨報果通亦名性，以是義故，相不簡佛性。	又，佛常、樂、我、淨報果通亦名性，以是義故，相不簡佛性。	Moreover, the fruition of recompense of the Buddha's eternity, bliss, self, and purity is also called nature. For this reason, the characteristics do not distinguish the Buddha-nature.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0758c28_6']	下餘空中不簡例然。	下餘空中不簡例然。	The other emptinesses below are not distinguished in the same way.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0758c29_2', 'ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a01_13']	「無所有」中，先問，次辯，後總結之。🔽辯中，先明假名人相本無所有，「愚癡人」下明其因緣假名法相本無所有。	「無所有」中，先問，次辯，後總結之。 辯中，先明假名人相本無所有，「愚癡人」下明其因緣假名法相本無所有。	In non-existence, first it asks, then analyzes, and finally concludes.🔽In the analysis, it first clarifies that the characteristics of a person are originally non-existent, and below ignorant people it clarifies that the characteristics of the dharmas of provisional names and conditions are originally non-existent.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a04_6']	前中先喻，「如人無子言舍空」者，子相亦無，不但無性，畢竟觀空無有親愛約之顯法，此無人相不同前六空無人性。	前中先喻，「如人無子言舍空」者，子相亦無，不但無性，畢竟觀空無有親愛約之顯法，此無人相不同前六空無人性。	In the former, it first uses a metaphor. A person without children says the house is empty means that the characteristics of a child are also non-existent, not only that there is no nature. Ultimately observing emptiness, without any affection, it manifests the Dharma. This characteristic of no person is different from the previous six emptinesses that have no nature of a person.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a06_4']	後中先喻，「愚癡之人言諸方空」明其所異，愚人雖說諸方是空，於事分齊方實不空。	後中先喻，「愚癡之人言諸方空」明其所異，愚人雖說諸方是空，於事分齊方實不空。	Later, first the analogy: A foolish person says that all directions are empty clarifies what is different. Although a foolish person says that all directions are empty, in terms of the scope of things, the directions are actually not empty.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a07_17']	「貧窮之人言一切空」彰其所同，貧窮之人言無物者，物相亦無，非直無性。	「貧窮之人言一切空」彰其所同，貧窮之人言無物者，物相亦無，非直無性。	A poor person says that everything is empty shows what is the same. A poor person says that there is nothing, and the characteristics of things are also non-existent, not just lacking inherent nature.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a09_18']	「如是所計或空、不空」重辯前喻，貧人所計實無所有故言或空，愚人所計事實不空名或不空。	「如是所計或空、不空」重辯前喻，貧人所計實無所有故言或空，愚人所計事實不空名或不空。	Thus, what is conceived as either empty or not empty reiterates the previous analogy. Since what is conceived by a poor person is actually nothing, it is said to be either empty. What is conceived by a foolish person is actually not empty, so it is called either not empty.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a11_7']	下約顯法，「菩薩觀空如貧無物，一切皆空」，不同愚人不空言空。	下約顯法，「菩薩觀空如貧無物，一切皆空」，不同愚人不空言空。	Below, it is applied to illustrate the Dharma: Bodhisattvas contemplate emptiness like a poor person with no possessions, all are empty, unlike the foolish person who says that what is not empty is empty.

['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a15_4']	後中，先問何等名為第一義空，有業、有報故非定無，非定無故第一義空。	後中，先問何等名為第一義空，有業、有報故非定無，非定無故第一義空。	Later in the middle, first asking what is called the emptiness of ultimate truth, because there is karma and retribution, it is not definitely non-existent. Because it is not definitely non-existent, it is the emptiness of ultimate truth.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a16_14']	以其因緣假有破無，不將性有而破彼無，故復說言「不見作者」。	以其因緣假有破無，不將性有而破彼無，故復說言「不見作者」。	Because it uses conditioned arising to provisionally exist and destroy non-existence, it does not use inherent existence to destroy that non-existence, so it further says not seeing the doer.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a16_21']	「如是」下結。	「如是」下結。	Thus and below concludes.

['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a21_18']	言是無者牒前八空，前八空中以無破有故曰是無。	言是無者牒前八空，前八空中以無破有故曰是無。	This non-existence refers to the previous eight kinds of emptiness. In the previous eight kinds of emptiness, it uses non-existence to destroy existence, so it is said to be non-existent.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a22_14']	就此有、無以說空義，故曰空空。	就此有、無以說空義，故曰空空。	Based on this existence and non-existence, the meaning of emptiness is explained, so it is called the emptiness of emptiness.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a23_8']	「是是、非是是名空空」破詮顯理。	「是是、非是是名空空」破詮顯理。	This is and that is not is called emptiness of emptiness, which refutes the provisional teachings to reveal the principle.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0759a25_14']	前句雖復就詮辯理，非留彼詮故復破之，是向有是、是向無是，兩俱非是方名空空，非留有無說為空空。	前句雖復就詮辯理，非留彼詮故復破之，是向有是、是向無是，兩俱非是方名空空，非留有無說為空空。	Although the previous statement discusses the principle based on the provisional teachings, it does not retain those provisional teachings, so it refutes them again. This is the is of the previous existence and the is of the previous non-existence, both of which are not the is, which is then called emptiness of emptiness. It does not retain existence or non-existence and call it emptiness of emptiness.

Because they have the same essence, non-existence is said to be existence, and existence is said to be non-existence. Because non-existence is existence, existence is not existence; because existence is non-existence, non-existence is not non-existence. Because it is neither existence nor non-existence, it is called emptiness of emptiness.

The śrāvakas' attainments are discussed differently. In the Abhidharma teachings, it is said that śrāvakas first contemplate the five aggregates as not the self or what belongs to the self, simply called emptiness. Later, they contemplate that the previous cognition is also not the self or what belongs to the self, thus called emptiness of emptiness.

Kasyapa replied to the Buddha, clarifying that it is not definite. If asuras can cross, it is conceivable, but if humans cross, it is inconceivable. He briefly answered, Or it is conceivable, or not.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0770a15_7']	「何以」下釋，此明修羅能渡可思，喻佛如來能渡可思。	「何以」下釋，此明修羅能渡可思，喻佛如來能渡可思。	Why? below explains. This clarifies that asuras being able to cross is conceivable, which is a metaphor for the Tathagata Buddha being able to cross being conceivable.

Kāśyapa correctly answers that it is inconceivable. The Buddha then uses this to explain that this bodhisattva's momentary ability to measure all birth and death is inconceivable.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0770a26_16']	第四段中辯明菩薩常觀生死、無常苦等，而於其中為諸眾生分別佛性常、樂、我、淨，雖說常等而於生死不起倒見，是故不思。	第四段中辯明菩薩常觀生死、無常苦等，而於其中為諸眾生分別佛性常、樂、我、淨，雖說常等而於生死不起倒見，是故不思。	In the fourth section, it is clarified that the bodhisattva always contemplates the impermanence, suffering, etc. of birth and death, but within this he distinguishes the Buddha-nature of sentient beings as permanent, blissful, self, and pure. Although he speaks of permanence, etc., he does not give rise to inverted views within birth and death, and therefore it is inconceivable.

['ZH_T37_1764_006:0770b11_20']	心證菩提故不可思，良以是心本從緣染，後息妄染，內照實性，所以可說。	心證菩提故不可思，良以是心本從緣染，後息妄染，內照實性，所以可說。	Because the mind realizes enlightenment, it is inconceivable. This mind originally arises from conditioned defilements, and later, by ceasing deluded defilements and internally illuminating the true nature, it can be spoken of.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0770b13_7']	行證之時，法從心現，不從外來，故無師諮而能自得阿耨菩提。	行證之時，法從心現，不從外來，故無師諮而能自得阿耨菩提。	When practicing and realizing, the Dharma appears from the mind and does not come from outside, so without consulting a teacher, one can attain supreme enlightenment by oneself.

If nirvana, buddha-nature, and other such dharmas are definitely inaudible, then they are simply called unheard, and cannot be called unheard yet heard.

['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b07_12', 'ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b11_3']	喻中，生到反得三事共顯一義，亦可去到喻聞涅槃，生與不生喻顯佛性，得與不得喻顯菩提。🔽就初喻中，將「去」喻聞，「到」喻不聞，「譬如去者」喻能聞人，「到則不去」類顯初句，如彼世人已得到者不可言去，所況如是，諸佛菩薩已得涅槃，不聞法竟不得言聞。	喻中，生到反得三事共顯一義，亦可去到喻聞涅槃，生與不生喻顯佛性，得與不得喻顯菩提。 就初喻中，將「去」喻聞，「到」喻不聞，「譬如去者」喻能聞人，「到則不去」類顯初句，如彼世人已得到者不可言去，所況如是，諸佛菩薩已得涅槃，不聞法竟不得言聞。	In the analogy, going and reaching together illustrate one meaning, and going and reaching can also be used as analogies for hearing nirvana, going and not going can be used as analogies to illustrate buddha-nature, and reaching and not reaching can be used as analogies to illustrate bodhi.🔽In the first analogy, going is used as an analogy for hearing, reaching is used as an analogy for not hearing, like a goer is used as an analogy for a person who can hear, and reaching then not going illustrates the first sentence, just as a person in the world who has already reached a place cannot be said to be going, the meaning being similar to this, all buddhas and bodhisattvas have already attained nirvana, and cannot be said to hear the Dharma again after having already heard it.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b13_5']	「去則不到」類顯後句，如彼世人在路去時不得名到，所況如是，已得聞者則更不得聞於不聞。	「去則不到」類顯後句，如彼世人在路去時不得名到，所況如是，已得聞者則更不得聞於不聞。	Going then not reaching illustrates the latter sentence, just as a person in the world who is on the road going cannot be said to have reached, the meaning being similar to this, those who have already heard cannot hear the unheard again.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b18_17']	第二喻中，將「生」喻聞，「不生」喻於不聞之義，「生已不生」類顯後句，如彼生相生諸法時不得說言生於不生，所況如是，已得聞時不得宣說聞於不聞，「不生不生」類向前句，如彼虛空不可生故正名不生不得言生，所況即是，不可聞法正名不聞不得言聞。	第二喻中，將「生」喻聞，「不生」喻於不聞之義，「生已不生」類顯後句，如彼生相生諸法時不得說言生於不生，所況如是，已得聞時不得宣說聞於不聞，「不生不生」類向前句，如彼虛空不可生故正名不生不得言生，所況即是，不可聞法正名不聞不得言聞。	In the second analogy, arising is likened to hearing, and non-arising to the meaning of non-hearing. Having arisen, not arising illustrates the latter phrase, just as when the characteristic of arising gives rise to dharmas, one cannot say it gives rise to non-arising. The analogy is like this. When hearing has been attained, one cannot proclaim hearing of non-hearing. Non-arising, non-arising illustrates the former phrase. Just as space cannot be arisen, so it is rightly called non-arising, and one cannot say it is arisen. The analogy is just like this. The Dharma that cannot be heard is rightly called unhearable, and one cannot say it is heard.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b20_7']	第三喻中，將「得」喻聞，「不得」喻於不聞之義，「得已不得」類向後句。	第三喻中，將「得」喻聞，「不得」喻於不聞之義，「得已不得」類向後句。	In the third analogy, attainment is likened to hearing, and non-attainment to the meaning of non-hearing. Having attained, not attaining illustrates the latter phrase.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b23_11', 'ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b26_8']	如彼十四不相應中，有一非色非心之得能得諸法，今取為喻，即彼諸得得諸法時，不得名為得於不得，所況如是，已得聞持不得說為聞於不聞。🔽「不得不得」類顯前句，如兔角等不可得法正名不得，不可說之為不得得，所況如是，不可聞法正名不聞，不得說之為不聞聞。	如彼十四不相應中，有一非色非心之得能得諸法，今取為喻，即彼諸得得諸法時，不得名為得於不得，所況如是，已得聞持不得說為聞於不聞。 「不得不得」類顯前句，如兔角等不可得法正名不得，不可說之為不得得，所況如是，不可聞法正名不聞，不得說之為不聞聞。	Just as among the fourteen non-associated dharmas, there is a non-form, non-mind attainment that can attain all dharmas, now taking it as an analogy, when those attainments attain all dharmas, it cannot be said that they attain non-attainment, much less is it so for the already attained hearing and retention that cannot be said to hear the unhearable.🔽Non-attainment of non-attainment illustrates the previous phrase. Just as the unobtainable dharmas such as rabbit horns are correctly called non-attainment, it cannot be said to be the attainment of non-attainment, much less is it so for the unobtainable dharma that is correctly called unhearable, which cannot be said to be the hearing of the unhearable.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785b28_20']	上來立喻，「聞已不聞、不聞不聞亦復如是」合之顯法，「聞已不得」舉向後句以合前喻，「不聞不聞」舉上初句以合前喻。	上來立喻，「聞已不聞、不聞不聞亦復如是」合之顯法，「聞已不得」舉向後句以合前喻，「不聞不聞」舉上初句以合前喻。	The above establishes the analogy. Having heard, not hearing, not hearing, not hearing is also like this combines it to illustrate the dharma. Having heard, not attaining raises the latter phrase to combine with the previous analogy. Not hearing, not hearing raises the first phrase to combine with the previous analogy.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c01_11']	第三對中，初句就其未聞之時難破有聞，明其唯是不聞不聞，非不聞聞。	第三對中，初句就其未聞之時難破有聞，明其唯是不聞不聞，非不聞聞。	In the third pair, the first sentence uses the time of not yet hearing to refute the existence of hearing, clarifying that it is only the non-hearing of non-hearing, not the non-hearing of hearing.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c03_9']	後句就其不聞之時難破不聞，彰先有聞，先有聞，　後得聖時聞於可聞，非聞不聞。	後句就其不聞之時難破不聞，彰先有聞，先有聞，　後得聖時聞於可聞，非聞不聞。	The latter sentence uses the time of not hearing to refute non-hearing, showing that there was hearing before, and after attaining sagehood, one hears what can be heard, not the non-hearing of non-hearing.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c04_17']	前中，「世尊若不聞聞者」審定如來未聞之時已有聞性，名不聞聞。	前中，「世尊若不聞聞者」審定如來未聞之時已有聞性，名不聞聞。	In the former, World-Honored One, if one hears what has not been heard examines and determines that when the Tathāgata has not yet heard, there is already the nature of hearing, called the non-hearing of hearing.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c05_8']	下就設難，難有三階：	下就設難，難有三階：	Below, it presents a difficulty. The difficulty has three stages:
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c07_20']	一就地前凡夫設難，若未聞時已有聞者，「一切眾生未有菩提即應有之，未得涅槃亦應得之，未見佛性亦應見之」。	一就地前凡夫設難，若未聞時已有聞者，「一切眾生未有菩提即應有之，未得涅槃亦應得之，未見佛性亦應見之」。	First, it presents a difficulty based on the ordinary beings before the grounds. If there is hearing when one has not yet heard, all sentient beings should already have bodhi, should already attain nirvāṇa, and should already see the Buddha-nature.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c09_17']	二就十住菩薩設難，若未聞時已有聞者，「云何說言十住菩薩雖見佛性，未得明了」。	二就十住菩薩設難，若未聞時已有聞者，「云何說言十住菩薩雖見佛性，未得明了」。	Second, it presents a challenge based on the bodhisattvas in the ten abodes, saying that if they already had hearing before hearing it, why is it said that the bodhisattvas in the ten abodes, although they see the Buddha-nature, have not yet attained clarity?
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c11_3']	三就佛設難，若未聞時已有聞者，「如來本昔從誰得聞」。	三就佛設難，若未聞時已有聞者，「如來本昔從誰得聞」。	Third, it presents a challenge based on the Buddha, saying that if he already had hearing before hearing it, from whom did the Tathāgata originally hear it in the past?
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c12_2']	若有聞處，「何故如來於《阿含》中說言無師」。	若有聞處，「何故如來於《阿含》中說言無師」。	If there was a place of hearing, why did the Tathāgata say in the Āgamas that he had no teacher?
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c13_11']	後中初言「若不聞不聞」審定如來未聞之時令無聞性，名不聞不聞。	後中初言「若不聞不聞」審定如來未聞之時令無聞性，名不聞不聞。	In the latter part, it first says, If there is no hearing of the unheard, examining and determining that when the Tathāgata had not yet heard it, he had no nature of hearing, called no hearing of the unheard.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c14_1', 'ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c15_4']	下就設難，難意如何？🔽若佛如來本未聞時一向無聞，後得菩提及見佛性。	下就設難，難意如何？ 若佛如來本未聞時一向無聞，後得菩提及見佛性。	Below, it presents a challenge. What is the meaning of the challenge?🔽If the Buddha Tathāgata originally had no hearing at all before hearing it, and later attained enlightenment and saw the Buddha-nature,
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c16_11']	一切眾生未聞之時亦無有聞，亦應同佛得成菩提見於佛性。	一切眾生未聞之時亦無有聞，亦應同佛得成菩提見於佛性。	then when all sentient beings have not yet heard it, they also have no hearing, and they should also be the same as the Buddha in attaining enlightenment and seeing the Buddha-nature.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c17_15']	一切眾生不得菩提不見佛性，可得宣說本無有聞。	一切眾生不得菩提不見佛性，可得宣說本無有聞。	All sentient beings cannot attain bodhi and do not see the buddha-nature, so it is possible to proclaim that there was originally no hearing.
['ZH_T37_1764_006:0785c19_9']	佛得菩提見佛性故明本有聞，本有聞故佛令聞時聞於先聞，非聞不聞。	佛得菩提見佛性故明本有聞，本有聞故佛令聞時聞於先聞，非聞不聞。	Because the Buddha attains bodhi and sees the buddha-nature, it is clear that there was originally hearing. Since there was originally hearing, when the Buddha causes hearing, hearing hears what was originally heard, not hearing what is not heard.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
