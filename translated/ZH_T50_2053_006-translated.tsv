When its form is hidden and not seen, even the wise are still deluded. How much more so for the Buddha's Way, which is lofty and empty, riding on the profound to control tranquility, widely benefiting the myriad kinds, and governing the ten directions. Raising its majestic spirit, it is unsurpassed. Suppressing its spiritual power, it has no lower limit. Magnified, it fills the universe. Diminished, it is contained within a single hair. Without extinction or birth, it passes through a thousand eons without becoming old. Like hiding or revealing, it operates for a hundred blessings and remains in the present. The wondrous Way is profoundly still, and those who follow it do not know its end. The flowing Dharma is calmly still, and those who measure it do not fathom its source. Therefore, how can the foolish and the ordinary, the mediocre and the base, cast aside their doubts and confusion when encountering its purport?
