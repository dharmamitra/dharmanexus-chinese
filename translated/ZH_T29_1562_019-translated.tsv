['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b23_13']	等無間緣何法為性？	等無間緣何法為性？	019	What is the nature of the condition as direct antecedent?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b24_3']	非後已生心心所法。	非後已生心心所法。	019	It is not the mind and mental factors that have arisen later.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b25_13']	謂除阿羅漢最後心心所，諸餘已生心心所法，一切皆是等無間緣。	謂除阿羅漢最後心心所，諸餘已生心心所法，一切皆是等無間緣。	019	That is to say, with the exception of the final mind and mental factors of an arhat, all other arisen mind and mental factors are the condition as direct antecedent.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b26_8']	為簡未來無為法故，說已生言。	為簡未來無為法故，說已生言。	019	In order to distinguish future and unconditioned dharmas, the words already arisen are used.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b27_2']	為簡諸色不相應故，說心心所。	為簡諸色不相應故，說心心所。	019	In order to distinguish form and the factors not directly associated with mind, mind and mental factors are used.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b27_13']	何故等無間緣唯心心所？	何故等無間緣唯心心所？	019	Why is the condition as direct antecedent only mind and mental factors?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b28_5']	此與等無間緣義相應故。	此與等無間緣義相應故。	019	Because this accords with the meaning of the condition as direct antecedent.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442b29_4']	此緣生法等而無間，依此義立等無間名。	此緣生法等而無間，依此義立等無間名。	019	The meaning of this condition is that the dharmas that arise are equal and without interval. The name condition as direct antecedent is established based on this meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c01_3']	謂一相續必無同類二法俱生，故說名等。	謂一相續必無同類二法俱生，故說名等。	019	That is to say, in a single continuity, two dharmas of the same type do not necessarily arise simultaneously, and therefore it is called equal.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c02_2']	此緣對果，無同類法中間為隔，故名無間。	此緣對果，無同類法中間為隔，故名無間。	019	Because there is no similar dharma in the interval, it is called uninterrupted.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c03_9']	若說此果無間續生名無間者，出無想等心等望前應非無間。	若說此果無間續生名無間者，出無想等心等望前應非無間。	019	If it is said that this result is called uninterrupted because it arises without interruption, then the mind and so on of one emerging from the attainment of non-perception should not be called uninterrupted.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c04_17']	或無等法於中間起名等無間，是二中間無容得有等法生義。	或無等法於中間起名等無間，是二中間無容得有等法生義。	019	Or, it is called uninterrupted because no equal dharma arises in the interval. This means that no equal dharma can arise in the interval between the two.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c06_6']	或前俱生心心所品等，與無間後品為緣，非唯類同名等無間。	或前俱生心心所品等，與無間後品為緣，非唯類同名等無間。	019	Or, the class of mind and mental factors that arise together with the preceding moment is a condition for the subsequent uninterrupted class, and it is not only called uninterrupted because of the similarity of type.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c06_15']	唯執同類相續者言：	唯執同類相續者言：	019	Those who hold that only similar and continuous [dharmas] are so [say]:
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c07_14']	唯心心所一一自類，前能為後等無間緣。	唯心心所一一自類，前能為後等無間緣。	019	Only the individual members of mind and mental factors can be the condition as the equivalent and immediate antecedent for the subsequent [members of the same type].
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c08_7', 'ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c08_15']	如是便違本論所說，如說：🔽云何心等無間法？	如是便違本論所說，如說： 云何心等無間法？	019	This contradicts what is said in the Abhidharma-śāstra, which states:🔽What are the dharmas that are the equivalent and immediate antecedent?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c09_10']	謂心無間餘心心所法，乃至廣說。	謂心無間餘心心所法，乃至廣說。	019	It is said: The mind and mental factors that are immediately antecedent to the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c10_14']	理亦有違，謂有尋伺三摩地無間或無尋伺三摩地現前。	理亦有違，謂有尋伺三摩地無間或無尋伺三摩地現前。	019	This also contradicts reason, because the samādhi with initial and sustained thought can be immediately followed by the samādhi without initial but with sustained thought, or by the samādhi without either.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c11_15']	彼尋伺應非等無間緣性及無尋伺三摩地無間。	彼尋伺應非等無間緣性及無尋伺三摩地無間。	019	Then investigation and analysis would not be the nature of the similar and immediately antecedent condition, and the samādhi without investigation and analysis would not be without [the similar and immediately antecedent condition].
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c12_18']	或有尋伺三摩地現前，彼尋伺應無等無間緣起。	或有尋伺三摩地現前，彼尋伺應無等無間緣起。	019	Or, when a samādhi with investigation and analysis is present, that investigation and analysis would not arise with the similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c13_2']	彼言：	彼言：	019	They say:
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c15_13']	心心所雖等無間生，然非剎那無間必起，如從無想有情天沒時，五百劫前久滅心心所，與今心心所為等無間緣。	心心所雖等無間生，然非剎那無間必起，如從無想有情天沒時，五百劫前久滅心心所，與今心心所為等無間緣。	019	Although mind and mental factors arise with the similar and immediately antecedent condition, they are not necessarily produced without interval in a moment, just as when sentient beings fall from the heaven of non-perception, the mind and mental factors that have long ceased five hundred eons ago become the similar and immediately antecedent condition for the present mind and mental factors.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c16_15']	及出二定心心所法，以入心心所為等無間緣。	及出二定心心所法，以入心心所為等無間緣。	019	And the mind and mental factors of emerging from the two meditative absorptions take the mind and mental factors of entering [the absorptions] as the similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c17_13']	是等無間生，非剎那無間，此亦應爾。	是等無間生，非剎那無間，此亦應爾。	019	This is arising with the similar and immediately antecedent condition, but not without interval in a moment. This is also so.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c19_10']	彼有久滅有尋有伺、無尋無伺三摩地法，為今自類等無間緣，故無如前所說過失。	彼有久滅有尋有伺、無尋無伺三摩地法，為今自類等無間緣，故無如前所說過失。	019	They have the dharmas of meditative absorption with investigation and analysis, and without investigation and analysis that have long ceased, as the similar and immediately antecedent condition for their present own category, therefore there is no fault as stated above.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c20_9']	彼言非理，過去為現等無間緣，理不成故。	彼言非理，過去為現等無間緣，理不成故。	019	Their statement is unreasonable, because it is not established that the past becomes the similar and immediately antecedent condition for the present.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c22_6']	若正滅位已取後時心心所法為等無間，豈不便成等無間法亦有時分間隔方生。	若正滅位已取後時心心所法為等無間，豈不便成等無間法亦有時分間隔方生。	019	If the mind and mental activities of the present that are perishing take the subsequent mind and mental activities as similar and antecedent conditions, how can it be said that similar and antecedent conditions are born with an interval of time?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c23_5']	誰作定因無間不起，要餘分位間隔方生？	誰作定因無間不起，要餘分位間隔方生？	019	Who says that there is no interval of time between them? It is you who say that they are born with an interval of time.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c25_11']	然無想天、二無心定有隔時分當起定因，是則汝宗餘有心位心心所法，應非一切皆能為後等無間緣。	然無想天、二無心定有隔時分當起定因，是則汝宗餘有心位心心所法，應非一切皆能為後等無間緣。	019	If the causes for the birth of the two mindless samādhis and the mindless heavens are separated by a period of time, then the minds and mental activities of other states with minds in your school would not be similar and antecedent conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c28_16']	若汝謂此如阿羅漢後心心所，設不為後等無間緣，有何過者，亦不應理，彼後無間心心所法永不生故，此後無間心心所法當有可生於中亦無。	若汝謂此如阿羅漢後心心所，設不為後等無間緣，有何過者，亦不應理，彼後無間心心所法永不生故，此後無間心心所法當有可生於中亦無。	019	If you say that they are like the final mind and mental activities of an arhat, which, even though they are not similar and antecedent conditions for a subsequent mind, are not faulty, this is not reasonable, because the final mind and mental activities of an arhat are never born again, and the subsequent mind and mental activities are also never born.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0442c29_8']	等類為間，何非緣體？	等類為間，何非緣體？	019	What is wrong with saying that a similar and antecedent condition is a condition that is not similar and antecedent?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a01_6']	又此心品無間所生，復以何緣非等無間？	又此心品無間所生，復以何緣非等無間？	019	Also, what is the condition for the mind and mental activities that are born with an interval of time, that they are not similar and antecedent conditions?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a03_7']	然有能容後餘心心所令必可起名等無間緣，彼阿羅漢後心心所無容起後，故非此例。	然有能容後餘心心所令必可起名等無間緣，彼阿羅漢後心心所無容起後，故非此例。	019	However, it is able to contain the subsequent remaining mind and mental activities, enabling them to definitely arise, and is therefore called the similar and immediately antecedent condition. The final mind and mental activities of an arhat do not contain subsequent mind and mental activities, and therefore this is not an example of the similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a03_17']	於有漏定，理且如前；	於有漏定，理且如前；	019	The principle of the impure concentrations is as discussed above.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a04_5', 'ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a07_4']	無漏定中當更徵斥。🔽謂若依止有尋伺定而得證入正性離生，不起期心復得上果，後入無漏無尋伺定，前所依定不復現前，彼前定應非等無間緣性。	無漏定中當更徵斥。 謂若依止有尋伺定而得證入正性離生，不起期心復得上果，後入無漏無尋伺定，前所依定不復現前，彼前定應非等無間緣性。	019	We must further refute the pure concentrations.🔽That is, if one relies on a concentration with applied thought and sustained thought and attains entry into the state of correct sharp insight, does not arouse a limited aspiration, and again obtains the fruit of a superior stage, and later enters a pure concentration without applied thought and sustained thought, then the previously relied on concentration does not appear again. The previous concentration should not be the similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a11_13']	或若依止第二靜慮乃至依止第四靜慮而得證入正性離生，不起期心得阿羅漢，後入無漏初靜慮等，彼後定應無等無間緣起，非執同類相續者宗必有當生有尋伺定故，及有已滅無尋伺定故。	或若依止第二靜慮乃至依止第四靜慮而得證入正性離生，不起期心得阿羅漢，後入無漏初靜慮等，彼後定應無等無間緣起，非執同類相續者宗必有當生有尋伺定故，及有已滅無尋伺定故。	019	Or, if one relies on the second trance state up to the fourth trance state and attains entry into the state of correct sharp insight, does not arouse a limited aspiration and obtains the state of arhat, and later enters a pure first trance state, etc., then the subsequent concentration should not arise with the similar and immediately antecedent condition, because the school that maintains that the same species continues does not necessarily have a future concentration with applied thought and sustained thought, and because it has already been extinguished without applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a12_3']	又此何勞更深徵斥？	又此何勞更深徵斥？	019	Why bother to refute it further?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a13_4']	且初無漏心等應不生，無等無間緣為能取故。	且初無漏心等應不生，無等無間緣為能取故。	019	Moreover, the first pure mind, etc., should not arise, because the condition as cause is not grasped.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a14_11']	既爾，解脫畢竟應無，豈不如無同類因取而有無漏初心等生？	既爾，解脫畢竟應無，豈不如無同類因取而有無漏初心等生？	019	If this is so, then liberation should be absolutely nonexistent. How is it that, just as there is no similar cause to grasp, the first pure mind, etc., are born?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a15_13']	如是雖無等無間緣取，何妨無漏初心等亦生。	如是雖無等無間緣取，何妨無漏初心等亦生。	019	In the same way, even though there is no condition as cause to grasp, why is it not possible for the first pure mind, etc., to be born?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a16_3']	此例非等，緣必具故。	此例非等，緣必具故。	019	This example is not the same, because conditions must be complete.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a17_15']	謂此雖無同類因取，有餘因故定有因緣，初無漏心及心所法有所緣故。	謂此雖無同類因取，有餘因故定有因緣，初無漏心及心所法有所緣故。	019	That is, although there is no similar cause to grasp, there is a cause because there is a condition as cause. The first pure mind and mental activities have an object.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a19_8']	如餘一切心心所法定四緣生，執同類宗二事皆闕，此心心所如何得生？	如餘一切心心所法定四緣生，執同類宗二事皆闕，此心心所如何得生？	019	Like all other minds and mental activities, they definitely arise from four conditions. The first pure mind and mental activities are not born, because they lack both a similar and immediately antecedent condition and a condition as cause. How can they be born?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a20_16']	非有極成心心所法從三緣起可為同喻，是故解脫畢竟應無。	非有極成心心所法從三緣起可為同喻，是故解脫畢竟應無。	019	There is no commonly recognized mind or mental activity that arises from three conditions that could serve as a point of comparison. Therefore liberation should be absolutely nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a22_7', 'ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a24_5']	若爾，唯應此心心所生由異類等無間緣，如無同類因唯異類牽起。🔽此亦非理，種子理故立同類因，有漏不應為無漏種，故非許此有同類因等無間緣。	若爾，唯應此心心所生由異類等無間緣，如無同類因唯異類牽起。 此亦非理，種子理故立同類因，有漏不應為無漏種，故非許此有同類因等無間緣。	019	If this is so, then only mind and its activities are born from the power of a different kind of similar and immediately antecedent condition, just as they are born from the power of a different kind of homogeneous cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a25_9']	由開避理，同類異類皆有此能與處牽生，力無別故。	由開避理，同類異類皆有此能與處牽生，力無別故。	019	This is not reasonable, because the principle of seeds is the reason for establishing homogeneous cause. Impure dharmas should not be the seeds of pure dharmas, and therefore it is not admitted that pure dharmas have a homogeneous cause. The similar and immediately antecedent condition is the power of the opening up of a place, and it is the same whether it is of the same species or not, because there is no difference in power.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a27_6']	諸心心所隨其所應同類異類皆能引起，許皆能作等無間緣，於教及理並無違失。	諸心心所隨其所應同類異類皆能引起，許皆能作等無間緣，於教及理並無違失。	019	Mind and its activities, as the case may be, are of the same species or of different species and are all able to attract and produce each other, and it is admitted that they are all similar and immediately antecedent conditions. This is not contrary to doctrine or reason.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443a28_14']	無想等喻與法不同，謂不相應非心心所，故不能作等無間緣。	無想等喻與法不同，謂不相應非心心所，故不能作等無間緣。	019	The analogy of the samādhi of nonconceptualization is not the same as the dharmas, because nonassociated dharmas are neither mind nor activities and therefore cannot be similar and immediately antecedent conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b01_4']	沒及出時心心所法，可還用彼生及入時心心所法為此緣起。	沒及出時心心所法，可還用彼生及入時心心所法為此緣起。	019	When one emerges from the samādhi of nonconceptualization, the mind and mental activities of the moment of emergence can use the mind and mental activities of the moment of entry into samādhi as a similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b02_14']	餘有心位剎那剎那等無間緣曾無暫闕，何勞以隔越為等無間緣？	餘有心位剎那剎那等無間緣曾無暫闕，何勞以隔越為等無間緣？	019	In other states of mind, the condition as cause is never absent for a moment, so why bother to make a distant state a condition as indirect antecedent?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b03_7']	夫等無間緣，謂與處牽起。	夫等無間緣，謂與處牽起。	019	The condition as direct antecedent is said to be that which immediately precedes a state.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b04_10']	異類心等與處牽起義同，而非等無間緣，斯有何理？	異類心等與處牽起義同，而非等無間緣，斯有何理？	019	The same is true of the relationship between dissimilar states of mind, and so on, and their states, but they are not conditions as direct antecedents. What reason can be given for this?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b05_17']	又應貪等等無間緣無間唯生貪等煩惱，則善心等無容得生；	又應貪等等無間緣無間唯生貪等煩惱，則善心等無容得生；	019	Also, if the condition as direct antecedent of craving is only craving, then other passions would not be born immediately after craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b08_5']	如是信等等無間緣無間唯應生於信等，則染心等無容得生，由是等難便為善伏唯執同類相續者論。	如是信等等無間緣無間唯應生於信等，則染心等無容得生，由是等難便為善伏唯執同類相續者論。	019	In the same way, if the condition as direct antecedent of faith is only faith, then defiled states of mind would not be born immediately after faith. For this and other reasons, the theory of a homogeneous series is easily refuted.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b09_4']	何故一身心心所法，無有同類二體俱生？	何故一身心心所法，無有同類二體俱生？	019	Why is it that in one body, mind and mental activities of the same species do not arise simultaneously?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b09_13']	等無間緣無第二故。	等無間緣無第二故。	019	Because there is no second condition as direct antecedent.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b10_8']	復何緣故無有第二等無間緣？	復何緣故無有第二等無間緣？	019	Why is there no second condition as direct antecedent?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b11_3']	一一有情各唯一心相續轉故。	一一有情各唯一心相續轉故。	019	Because each sentient being has only one mind series.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b12_2']	復何緣故知諸有情各唯一心相續而轉？	復何緣故知諸有情各唯一心相續而轉？	019	For what reason do we know that all sentient beings have only one mind continuum?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b13_1']	心於餘境正馳散時，於餘境中不審知故。	心於餘境正馳散時，於餘境中不審知故。	019	Because when the mind is scattered and running to other objects, it does not know other objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b14_1']	又心在定專一境時，餘境散心必不生故。	又心在定專一境時，餘境散心必不生故。	019	Also, when the mind is concentrated on one object, the scattered mind with respect to other objects does not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b14_10']	又現有能調伏心故。	又現有能調伏心故。	019	Also, because there is a present ability to subdue the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b15_8']	謂若許有二心俱生，誰復障多令不俱起？	謂若許有二心俱生，誰復障多令不俱起？	019	If it is admitted that two minds arise simultaneously, what prevents many from arising simultaneously?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b15_17']	是則應有多心並生。	是則應有多心並生。	019	Then it would follow that many minds would arise simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b16_16']	一有一心尚難調伏，況一有二或一有多。	一有一心尚難調伏，況一有二或一有多。	019	One mind is difficult to subdue, much more so one mind with two or many.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b17_17']	既現有能調伏心者，故知一身內一心相續生。	既現有能調伏心者，故知一身內一心相續生。	019	Since there is a present ability to subdue the mind, we know that in one body one mind continuum arises.
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b18_17']	又若一身多心並起，為境各別、為共相應？	又若一身多心並起，為境各別、為共相應？	019	Also, if many minds arise simultaneously in one body, are their objects different or are they associated?
['ZH_T29_1562_019:0443b19_16']	若共相應，一境一相無差別故，俱起唐捐。	若共相應，一境一相無差別故，俱起唐捐。	019	If they are associated, since one object and one characteristic are without distinction, their simultaneous arising is useless.
