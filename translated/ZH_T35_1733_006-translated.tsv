['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215b11_17']	此中意說一切眾生皆依真緣起，本識之心隨名言有支我見等薰，有六道身現。	此中意說一切眾生皆依真緣起，本識之心隨名言有支我見等薰，有六道身現。	006	The meaning here explains that all sentient beings rely on the true dependent arising, and the mind of the fundamental consciousness, according to the perfuming of the factors of existence, the view of self, etc., manifests the bodies of the six destinies.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215b13_1']	緣起虛假，不礙無、不壞有，是故會攝有其二門：	緣起虛假，不礙無、不壞有，是故會攝有其二門：	006	Dependent arising is false, not obstructing non-existence, not destroying existence, therefore, reconciling and subsuming existence has two approaches:
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215b13_18']	若會緣從實，即差別相盡，唯一真如；	若會緣從實，即差別相盡，唯一真如；	006	If reconciling conditions from reality, then the characteristics of differentiation are exhausted, and there is only one true suchness;

The upper line clarifies that the creator is not the created, using the analogy that the real subsuming the false is not identical to the false, because its nature is real.🔽The lower line clarifies that the created is not the creator, using the analogy that the false relying on the real is not identical to the real, because its nature is empty.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215b28_2']	下半明妄不離真，謂以虛徹真，虛盡真現，故云不離。	下半明妄不離真，謂以虛徹真，虛盡真現，故云不離。	006	The lower half clarifies that the false is not separate from the real, meaning that by penetrating the emptiness of the real, the emptiness is exhausted and the real appears, therefore it is said to be not separate.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215b28_16']	是故不離、不異、不即，思之。	是故不離、不異、不即，思之。	006	Therefore, it is not separate, not different, and not identical. Contemplate this.

The painter's mind in this analogy is like the fundamental consciousness, etc., the mind that is able to transform. The painted colors are analogous to the five aggregates, the body that is the retribution transformed.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c03_14']	上半明能所不即、下半顯本末不離，謂以心本形末所以不即，心變為報是故不離。	上半明能所不即、下半顯本末不離，謂以心本形末所以不即，心變為報是故不離。	006	The upper half clarifies that the able and the transformed are not identical, and the lower half reveals that the fundamental and the derivative are not separate. This is because the mind is fundamental and the form is derivative, so they are not identical. The mind transforms into retribution, therefore they are not separate.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c04_18']	此明心能變境，心體非境，境從心變，境相非心。	此明心能變境，心體非境，境從心變，境相非心。	006	This clarifies that the mind is able to transform objects, but the essence of the mind is not the object. The characteristics of the object are not the mind.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c05_8']	從心變故，境不離心；	從心變故，境不離心；	006	Because it transforms from the mind, the object is not separate from the mind;
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c05_18']	能變境故，心不離境。	能變境故，心不離境。	006	Because it can transform the object, the mind is not separate from the object.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c06_18']	是故雖不即不離，而要唯是識，非唯境也。	是故雖不即不離，而要唯是識，非唯境也。	006	Therefore, although it is neither identical nor separate, it is only consciousness, not only the object.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c07_1']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c08_9']	前偈但明彩不離四大，不明四大不離彩，何故與此不同耶？	前偈但明彩不離四大，不明四大不離彩，何故與此不同耶？	006	The previous verse only clarifies that the colors are not separate from the four great elements, but does not clarify that the four great elements are not separate from the colors. Why is it different from this?

['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c09_10']	前明真不變妄，此顯心變於境，故不同也。	前明真不變妄，此顯心變於境，故不同也。	006	The previous verse clarifies that the true does not change the false. This reveals that the mind transforms the object. Therefore, it is not the same.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c10_17']	後偈上半明畫師工巧心，喻能變識無住為本，故難思也。	後偈上半明畫師工巧心，喻能變識無住為本，故難思也。	006	The first half of the latter verse clarifies the skillful mind of the painter, which is a metaphor for the transforming consciousness that takes non-abiding as its basis, and is therefore difficult to fathom.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c12_2']	下半顯所現畫色，喻所變相各從心現，無體可相知。	下半顯所現畫色，喻所變相各從心現，無體可相知。	006	The second half reveals the painted colors that are manifested, which is a metaphor for the transformed phenomena that each arise from the mind and have no essence that can be known.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c13_6']	後半畫師不知此畫皆從心現，喻諸眾生迷自心量。	後半畫師不知此畫皆從心現，喻諸眾生迷自心量。	006	The latter half of the verse, the painter does not know that these paintings all arise from the mind, is a metaphor for sentient beings being deluded about their own mind's scope.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c13_16']	下一偈半法合，可知。	下一偈半法合，可知。	006	The following half verse is the Dharma correspondence, which can be understood.

Just as the mind is, so is the Buddha. Taking the ordinary to be like the Buddha, just as the mind creates the ordinary, creating the Buddha is also like this, all arising from the mind.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c16_4']	如佛眾生然，將佛類凡。	如佛眾生然，將佛類凡。	006	Taking the Buddha to be like the ordinary,

['ZH_T35_1733_006:0215c17_13']	心作凡夫，心凡無別。	心作凡夫，心凡無別。	006	The mind creating ordinary beings, the mind and ordinary beings are no different.

The first half clarifies that body and mind have different appearances and are therefore not identical. The second half clarifies that the body appears based on the mind and is therefore not separate.

The next one clarifies that the one who praises the Buddha attains great merit. The last six praise the Buddha's responsive manifestations of form and sound.
['ZH_T35_1733_006:0216a04_8', 'ZH_T35_1733_006:0216a04_14']	前中，初一明離六塵相，謂初句離香味觸三塵，故云不可取也；🔽次句離色塵；	前中，初一明離六塵相，謂初句離香味觸三塵，故云不可取也； 次句離色塵；	006	In the first half, the first verse clarifies the transcendence of the six sense objects. The first line transcends the three sense objects of smell, taste, and touch, thus it says cannot be grasped.🔽The next line transcends the sense object of form.
