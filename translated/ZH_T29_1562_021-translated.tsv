['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c08_12']	已善伏除雜脩靜慮上中品障，意樂調柔、離諸熱惱，故名無熱。	已善伏除雜脩靜慮上中品障，意樂調柔、離諸熱惱，故名無熱。	Having well subdued and eliminated the middling and upper level hindrances to mixed cultivation of dhyana, the mind is pliable and free from distress, and for this reason it is called No Heat.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c09_12']	或令下生煩惱名熱，此初離遠，得無熱名。	或令下生煩惱名熱，此初離遠，得無熱名。	Or, the afflictions that cause rebirth in lower realms are called heat. Because one is initially far from them, it is called No Heat.

['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c18_4']	有餘別說十七處名，初靜慮中總立二處，第四靜慮別說無想。	有餘別說十七處名，初靜慮中總立二處，第四靜慮別說無想。	Some others explain the name of the seventeen places differently, establishing two places in the first trance state in general, and calling the fourth trance state the non-conceptual state.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c19_17']	彼師應言處有十八，以彼大梵望梵輔天，壽量身量、無尋受等皆有別故。	彼師應言處有十八，以彼大梵望梵輔天，壽量身量、無尋受等皆有別故。	That teacher should say that there are eighteen places, because the great Brahma, compared to the Brahma assistants, has a different life span, body size, and feeling without investigation, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c21_5']	豈不無想望廣果天，唯異生等有差別故，前亦應言處有十八？	豈不無想望廣果天，唯異生等有差別故，前亦應言處有十八？	Isn't it that the non-conceptual state, compared to the heaven of vast fruit, has only differences in ordinary beings, etc., so the previous should also say that there are eighteen places?
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c22_4']	此難非理，無想天生即廣果天繫業果故。	此難非理，無想天生即廣果天繫業果故。	This objection is unreasonable, because the birth of the non-conceptual state is bound to the fruit of karma of the heaven of vast fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c23_12']	若爾，大梵所受生身，亦梵輔天繫業果故，不應別說為一天處。	若爾，大梵所受生身，亦梵輔天繫業果故，不應別說為一天處。	If this is so, then the body of the great brahma god born in the first trance heaven is also the result of karma bound to the heaven of brahma’s assistants, and it should not be separately established as a heaven.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c25_5']	即梵輔天上品繫業招大梵果，此業望彼少有差別，故招壽等亦少不同。	即梵輔天上品繫業招大梵果，此業望彼少有差別，故招壽等亦少不同。	The superior karma that binds to the heaven of brahma’s assistants attracts the result of the great brahma god. This karma has a slight difference from that which attracts life, etc., and therefore it also attracts a slight difference in life, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c27_4']	若大梵天望彼梵輔，壽量等別合為一處，則少光等壽等雖殊，應合一處，成大過失。	若大梵天望彼梵輔，壽量等別合為一處，則少光等壽等雖殊，應合一處，成大過失。	If the great brahma god is combined with the heaven of brahma’s assistants into one place because of the difference in life, etc., then the difference in life, etc., in the heaven of little light, etc., should be combined into one place, resulting in a great error.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c27_14']	此例不然，大梵一故。	此例不然，大梵一故。	This example is not correct, because the great brahma god is one.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0456c28_13']	要依同分立天處名，非一梵王可名同分。	要依同分立天處名，非一梵王可名同分。	The name of a heaven is established on the basis of a commonality of karma. The one brahma king cannot be called a commonality of karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a02_10']	雖壽量等與餘不同，然由一身不成同分，故與梵輔合立一天，高下雖殊，然地無別，少光天等與此相違，故彼不應引之為例。	雖壽量等與餘不同，然由一身不成同分，故與梵輔合立一天，高下雖殊，然地無別，少光天等與此相違，故彼不應引之為例。	Although life, etc., are different from the others, still, because one body does not constitute a commonality of karma, it is combined with the heaven of brahma’s assistants to establish one heaven. Although there is a difference in height, the ground is not different. The heaven of little light, etc., is contrary to this, and therefore it should not be cited as an example.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a03_6']	上座色界立十八天，故作是言：	上座色界立十八天，故作是言：	The Sthaviravāda establishes eighteen heavens in the form realm. Therefore, it is said:
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a04_1']	修諸靜慮各有三品，謂上中下。	修諸靜慮各有三品，謂上中下。	The cultivation of the various meditations is divided into three grades, superior, middling, and inferior.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a04_11']	隨三品因，生三天處。	隨三品因，生三天處。	According to these three grades of causes, one is born in the three heavens.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a06_1']	第一靜慮大梵天王，自類相望得有同分，與梵輔處勝劣有殊。	第一靜慮大梵天王，自類相望得有同分，與梵輔處勝劣有殊。	The great Brahma kings of the first meditation have the same species, but there is a difference in superiority and inferiority between them and the Brahmapurohita gods.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a06_19']	如聚落邊阿練若處，雖相隣近而處不同。	如聚落邊阿練若處，雖相隣近而處不同。	Although the āranya and kūṭāgāra are close to a village, the places are not the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a08_8']	無想有情於第四定為第四處，與廣果天有差別故，處成十八。	無想有情於第四定為第四處，與廣果天有差別故，處成十八。	The fourth place of the fourth meditation is the sentient beings of non-conceptual meditation. Because there is a difference from the Bṛhatphala gods, the places are established as eighteen.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a09_15']	此亦不然，初靜慮地處應四故、無想有情應離廣果不別立故。	此亦不然，初靜慮地處應四故、無想有情應離廣果不別立故。	This is also not so, because the places of the first meditation should be four, and the sentient beings of non-conceptual meditation should be separated from the Bṛhatphala gods and not established separately.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a13_2']	若謂隨修三品靜慮，諸靜慮地處各三者，則大梵王壽等勝故，應異初定上中下因別用中間勝定業感，故應大梵異初定三，別業所招成第四處。	若謂隨修三品靜慮，諸靜慮地處各三者，則大梵王壽等勝故，應異初定上中下因別用中間勝定業感，故應大梵異初定三，別業所招成第四處。	If it is said that according to the cultivation of the three grades of meditations, the places of the various meditations are each divided into three, then because the lifespan and so forth of the great Brahma kings are superior, they should be different from the superior, middling, and inferior causes of the first meditation and be attracted by the karma of the superior meditation of the intermediate state. Therefore, the great Brahma kings should be different from the three of the first meditation and be attracted by separate karma, becoming the fourth place.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a15_1']	或應大梵無別有因，無想有情與彼廣果壽身量等無差別故，應無異因，處非第四。	或應大梵無別有因，無想有情與彼廣果壽身量等無差別故，應無異因，處非第四。	Or else, the great Brahma would have no separate cause, because the life span and body size of the sentient beings of the base of non-apperception are the same as those of the base of universal non-apperception. Therefore, there should be no difference in their causes, and that place should not be the fourth.
['ZH_T29_1562_021:0457a15_11']	故立十八，理必不成。	故立十八，理必不成。	Therefore, the establishment of eighteen is definitely not correct.

Even though the karma that accords with that retribution has already produced its results, they will definitely experience birth and the results of other karma, because the power of the results of other karma is swift.
