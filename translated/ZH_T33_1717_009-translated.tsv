['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876a25_0']	次明慧聖行，中二：先標列，次釋。釋中但	次明慧聖行，中二：先標列，次釋。釋中但	Next, explaining the wise holy practices, there are two parts: first, listing the headings; second, explaining. In the explanation,
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876a28_3']	釋四種四諦、不復判開者，前之兩行並在外凡，雖辨淺深，初心立信須明濃淡以標遠志。	釋四種四諦、不復判開者，前之兩行並在外凡，雖辨淺深，初心立信須明濃淡以標遠志。	only the four kinds of four truths are explained, and they are not further divided or revealed. The first two practices are both outside of the ordinary stage, and although the shallow and deep are distinguished, the initial mind establishes faith and must clarify the rich and dilute to set a distant goal.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b02_3']	今慧聖行始從初住終至初地，行自親證故不勞判，況歷位竪深義同四教已當於判，初地證同義當於開，是故此行不復辨開。	今慧聖行始從初住終至初地，行自親證故不勞判，況歷位竪深義同四教已當於判，初地證同義當於開，是故此行不復辨開。	Now, the wise holy practice begins from the initial abode and ends at the initial ground. The practice is personally realized, so there is no need to divide it. Moreover, the vertical depth of the stages is the same as the four teachings, which should correspond to the division. The meaning of realizing the same at the initial ground corresponds to the revelation. Therefore, this practice is no longer distinguished.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b03_3']	若欲判之，住前如乳，生滅等四如後四味。	若欲判之，住前如乳，生滅等四如後四味。	If it is to be divided, then what is before the abode is like milk, and the four such as arising and ceasing are like the subsequent four flavors.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b05_3']	所言開者，至初地時，地前諸行皆入初地薩婆若海，變為無緣一切法相，具如後辨。	所言開者，至初地時，地前諸行皆入初地薩婆若海，變為無緣一切法相，具如後辨。	As for the revelation, when reaching the initial ground, all the practices before the ground enter the ocean of sarvajña at the initial ground, and transform into the characteristics of all dharmas without conditions, which will be explained later.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b12_4']	今此四四諦雖並在別教，既約生滅等四竪判一教，別教菩薩即此自行而用化他，故十行中橫辨此四全為利物，所以四相各附彼教而為相狀，故初用生滅教慈悲六度在道諦中明，次無生無量中慈悲六度在滅諦後明，次無作中於四諦後略言無緣慈悲及明攝諸度及離怖畏得二十五三昧。	今此四四諦雖並在別教，既約生滅等四竪判一教，別教菩薩即此自行而用化他，故十行中橫辨此四全為利物，所以四相各附彼教而為相狀，故初用生滅教慈悲六度在道諦中明，次無生無量中慈悲六度在滅諦後明，次無作中於四諦後略言無緣慈悲及明攝諸度及離怖畏得二十五三昧。	Now, although these four four truths are all in the separate teaching, since they are vertically divided into one teaching according to the four such as arising and ceasing, the bodhisattvas of the separate teaching use this self-practice to transform others. Therefore, the ten practices horizontally discuss these four, which are entirely for benefiting beings. Therefore, the four characteristics each rely on that teaching to be the characteristics. Therefore, the first uses the teaching of arising and ceasing, compassion, and the six perfections in the truth of the path. Next, in the truth of cessation in the teachings of no arising and immeasurable, compassion and the six perfections are clarified. Next, in the teaching of no characteristics, the compassion of no conditions and the clarification of embracing all the perfections and leaving fear are briefly mentioned after the four truths, and the twenty-five samādhis are attained.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b13_11']	又復四中皆以苦集二諦並苦前集後，道滅並以道前滅後。	又復四中皆以苦集二諦並苦前集後，道滅並以道前滅後。	Moreover, in the four, the two truths of suffering and accumulation are both before suffering and after accumulation, and the path and cessation are both before the path and after cessation.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b16_1']	所以爾者，生滅等四智雖巧拙，莫不發足皆知苦斷集，先廣習道法後取涅槃，故與常儀所列稍異。	所以爾者，生滅等四智雖巧拙，莫不發足皆知苦斷集，先廣習道法後取涅槃，故與常儀所列稍異。	The reason for this is that although the four wisdoms such as arising and ceasing are skillful and clumsy, they all know suffering and cut off accumulation before starting out, and later extensively practice the Dharma of the path and attain nirvāṇa. Therefore, they are slightly different from the usual sequence.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b17_14']	生滅菩薩既不斷惑，故道諦中具諸願行無生無量，並斷惑已方乃赴難。	生滅菩薩既不斷惑，故道諦中具諸願行無生無量，並斷惑已方乃赴難。	Since the bodhisattvas of arising and extinction do not sever delusions, therefore in the truth of the path they possess all vows and practices, without birth and without measure, all severing delusions and only then responding to difficulties.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b18_14']	無作既在初地已證，以願滿故且略不論。	無作既在初地已證，以願滿故且略不論。	Since the bodhisattvas of no-more-learning have already realized it in the first ground, because their vows are fulfilled they are for the time being briefly not discussed.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b19_14']	真如分滿分具諸行，是故於此但明廣攝。	真如分滿分具諸行，是故於此但明廣攝。	The partial and complete of suchness are fully endowed with all practices, therefore here it only clarifies the extensive inclusion.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b20_18']	若通論願始並在戒聖行初，此中分進，分論故爾。	若通論願始並在戒聖行初，此中分進，分論故爾。	If one generally discusses the beginning of vows, they are all in the initial holy practice of precepts. Here it is divided and discussed in this way.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b21_14']	今初明生滅四諦，自為四文不同。	今初明生滅四諦，自為四文不同。	Now, first clarifying the four truths of arising and extinction, there are four different texts.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b23_14']	初苦諦者，苦體常作逼惱迫窄之事不自在故，三苦八苦廣如《大經．聖行》中明。	初苦諦者，苦體常作逼惱迫窄之事不自在故，三苦八苦廣如《大經．聖行》中明。	First, the truth of suffering. The essence of suffering always creates oppressive and constricting matters, because it is not free. The three sufferings and eight sufferings are extensively explained in the chapter on holy practices in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b24_9']	皆可見故，是顯了法，故云「現相」。	皆可見故，是顯了法，故云「現相」。	All can be seen, therefore it is an evident dharma, therefore it is said manifest characteristics.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b25_4']	三界皆苦不出此三，故云「三苦」。	三界皆苦不出此三，故云「三苦」。	The three realms are all suffering, not going beyond these three, therefore it is said three sufferings.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b25_15']	三苦如《止觀》第七記。	三苦如《止觀》第七記。	The three sufferings are as recorded in the seventh [fascicle] of the Śamathavipaśyanā.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b26_10']	「以不起迷著依正」者，此中恐剩「不」字。	「以不起迷著依正」者，此中恐剩「不」字。	Not giving rise to delusion and attachment to the environment and beings - here, the character not is missing.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876b29_9']	此集諦慧中先明三惡由迷依正，次明三善由達世間因果過故不行十惡及以十善，善之與惡俱是生長之相，故知剩「不」字。	此集諦慧中先明三惡由迷依正，次明三善由達世間因果過故不行十惡及以十善，善之與惡俱是生長之相，故知剩「不」字。	In this wisdom of the truth of accumulation, it first clarifies the three evils arising from delusion regarding the environment and beings, and then clarifies the three goods arising from penetrating the faults of worldly causes and effects, thus not engaging in the ten evils and ten goods. Goodness and evil are both characteristics of growth, so it is known that the character not is missing.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c02_7']	「終不」下至「邪僻失真」，明十善業道，以一「終不」字冠下諸句，終不殺他活己，不殺也。	「終不」下至「邪僻失真」，明十善業道，以一「終不」字冠下諸句，終不殺他活己，不殺也。	Never... up to deviating from the truth clarifies the ten wholesome courses of action. The single character never is placed at the beginning of the following sentences. Never killing others to sustain oneself is not killing.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c02_18']	終不奪彼潤身，不盜也。	終不奪彼潤身，不盜也。	Never depriving others of what they need to sustain their bodies is not stealing.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c03_9']	終不耽湎不淨，不婬也。	終不耽湎不淨，不婬也。	Never indulging in impurity is not sexual misconduct.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c04_1']	終不隱曲求直，不妄也。	終不隱曲求直，不妄也。	Never concealing crookedness to seek what is straight is not lying.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c05_5']	終不離合至榮辱，不兩舌也，謂離親合怨間榮搆辱。	終不離合至榮辱，不兩舌也，謂離親合怨間榮搆辱。	Never separating loved ones or bringing together those who hate, leading to honor or disgrace is not divisive speech, meaning separating loved ones, bringing together those who hate, and creating honor and disgrace.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c05_17']	終不內諂外佞，不綺語也。	終不內諂外佞，不綺語也。	Never being deceitful within or fawning without is not frivolous speech.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c06_9']	闕不惡口，以兩舌兼之。	闕不惡口，以兩舌兼之。	Lacking in not speaking harshly, it is combined with divisive speech.

['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c07_12']	終不縱毒傷道，不瞋也。	終不縱毒傷道，不瞋也。	Never giving free rein to poison that harms the Way, it is non-hatred.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c08_4']	終不邪僻失真，不邪見也。	終不邪僻失真，不邪見也。	Never deviating from the truth, it is non-delusion.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c09_8']	「生長等相」者，以由集故復至來世，故名為「長」。	「生長等相」者，以由集故復至來世，故名為「長」。	As for the characteristics of growth, etc., it is called growth because it leads to future lives.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c09_20']	由集輪迴，故名為「轉」。	由集輪迴，故名為「轉」。	It is called turning because it causes the cycle of rebirth.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c10_11']	遍起有因，故「云二十五有相」。	遍起有因，故「云二十五有相」。	It is called the characteristics of the twenty-five existences because it gives rise to causes everywhere.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c12_9']	道滅諦慧中俱云「除相」者，除是滅家之相，苦集是所除，道是能除，滅是除已，故無能字。	道滅諦慧中俱云「除相」者，除是滅家之相，苦集是所除，道是能除，滅是除已，故無能字。	In the wisdom of the truths of the path and cessation, both are called characteristics of elimination. Elimination is the characteristic of cessation. Suffering and accumulation are what is eliminated. The path is what eliminates. Cessation is what has already been eliminated, so there is no word for ability.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0876c13_2']	從所滅為名，故云「除相」。	從所滅為名，故云「除相」。	It is named after what is eliminated, so it is called characteristics of elimination.

The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra, fascicle 50, first quotes the sūtra as saying:

It extends to all dharmas, and even the Buddha is like an illusion and transformation. The Dharma of nirvana is also like an illusion and transformation.

Hearing these two things is like being startled and doubtful of an illusion, thinking that Subhuti has mistakenly said it and the listener has misunderstood, so he asks Subhuti again.

Although knowing that the path has no objects to be treated or crossed, and no one to cross over, one still constantly cultivates the path to treat suffering and accumulation, and to benefit sentient beings. The agent and object are both empty, yet treating and crossing over are both like illusory transformations. Therefore, there is nothing to attain.

When one's own and others' tasks are completed in illusory nirvāṇa, one attains the non-attainment of attainment.

However, the names of leaving fear actually pervade both the great and small vehicles. Because when the three bodhisattvas reach the holy stage, they are all able to leave the five fears. The bodhisattva of the Tripiṭaka, upon reaching the third asaṃkhyeya kalpa, is able to leave fear. Therefore, this statement pervades both the great and small vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0878b04_21']	如《雜含》中亦云「成就四力離五怖畏」，五怖畏名與《地持》同。	如《雜含》中亦云「成就四力離五怖畏」，五怖畏名與《地持》同。	As the Saṃyuktâgama also says, Accomplishing the four powers and leaving the five fears, the names of the five fears are the same as in the Bodhisattvabhūmi-sūtra.

['ZH_T33_1717_009:0878c27_17']	言「愛善道等及無愛憎身」者，不於善道起愛、惡道起憎，名無惡道畏；	言「愛善道等及無愛憎身」者，不於善道起愛、惡道起憎，名無惡道畏；	As for loving the good paths and so forth, and having no love or hatred in the body, not giving rise to love for the good paths or hatred for the evil paths is called having no fear of evil paths;
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0878c28_13']	不於善惡身起愛憎，名無死畏。	不於善惡身起愛憎，名無死畏。	Not giving rise to love or hatred for the bodies in the good or evil paths is called having no fear of death.

The first set of explanations is based on being free from the five fears, therefore there is no creation of the suffering and accumulation of evil, in order to manifest the perfect path of cessation, therefore it is said there is no creation.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0879a02_16']	縱使地前行次第行，至此據位亦是無作苦集諦壞。	縱使地前行次第行，至此據位亦是無作苦集諦壞。	Even if one practices the gradual practices before the grounds, reaching this stage is also the destruction of the suffering and accumulation of evil without creation.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0879a04_14']	準此應云離界內外兩五怖畏，同體我想不生，無界內外依報愛，故離兩處不活畏。	準此應云離界內外兩五怖畏，同體我想不生，無界內外依報愛，故離兩處不活畏。	Based on this, it should be said that one is free from the fears of the two sets of five within and without the realms, the view of self and the view of the aggregates of the same essence do not arise, and there is no attachment to the dependent rewards within and without the realms, thus one is free from the fear of not surviving in the two realms.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0879a05_17']	既得常身，欲常饒益十界眾生，故離九界惡名之畏。	既得常身，欲常饒益十界眾生，故離九界惡名之畏。	Having attained the eternal body, one always wishes to benefit the beings of the ten realms, thus one is free from the fear of the evil names of the nine realms.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0879a07_1']	於同體我見我想不生，故離分段、變易二死畏。	於同體我見我想不生，故離分段、變易二死畏。	The view of self and the view of the aggregates of the same essence do not arise, thus one is free from the fear of the two deaths of the stage of differentiation and the stage of transformation.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0879a08_14']	於實報土中受生，必常與舍那佛法身菩薩共會故，無方便教惡道畏也。	於實報土中受生，必常與舍那佛法身菩薩共會故，無方便教惡道畏也。	Being born in the land of true rewards, one will always be in the company of the Dharma body bodhisattvas of Vairocana Buddha, thus there is no fear of the evil paths of the expedient teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_009:0879a09_13']	既得法身無過上者，故離大眾威德畏。	既得法身無過上者，故離大眾威德畏。	Having attained the Dharma body that is unsurpassed, one is thus free from the fear of the majestic virtue of the great assembly.
