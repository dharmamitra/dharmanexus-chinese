The Hīnayāna is entrusted to the śrāvakas, and the Mahāyāna is entrusted to the bodhisattvas. Therefore, the text below says, Of the twelve divisions of the canon, only the vaipulya division is upheld by the bodhisattvas, while the remaining eleven divisions are upheld by the two vehicles.
['ZH_T37_1764_002:0649a14_4']	二就大乘淺深分別，淺付聲聞、深付菩薩，故龍樹說《波若》義淺付囑聲聞、《法華》義深付諸菩薩。	二就大乘淺深分別，淺付聲聞、深付菩薩，故龍樹說《波若》義淺付囑聲聞、《法華》義深付諸菩薩。	Second, the distinction between the shallow and profound within the Mahāyāna. The shallow is entrusted to the śrāvakas, and the profound is entrusted to the bodhisattvas. Therefore, Nāgārjuna says that the meaning of the Prajñāpāramitā is shallow and entrusted to the śrāvakas, while the meaning of the Lotus Sūtra is profound and entrusted to the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T37_1764_002:0649a15_3']	《波若》多說破相空理，未顯實義，故名為淺；	《波若》多說破相空理，未顯實義，故名為淺；	The Prajñāpāramitā often speaks of the principle of emptiness that refutes characteristics, and has yet to reveal the true meaning, so it is called shallow;
['ZH_T37_1764_002:0649a16_2']	《法華》宣說聲聞作佛，顯其有性，故名為深；	《法華》宣說聲聞作佛，顯其有性，故名為深；	The Lotus Sūtra proclaims that the śrāvakas will become buddhas, revealing their inherent nature, so it is called profound;
['ZH_T37_1764_002:0649a19_3']	三就深經教義分別，論其教法通付聲聞，義付菩薩，故下文言「今問阿難欲令受持《大涅槃經》，阿難比丘所未聞」者，弘廣菩薩當能流通。	三就深經教義分別，論其教法通付聲聞，義付菩薩，故下文言「今問阿難欲令受持《大涅槃經》，阿難比丘所未聞」者，弘廣菩薩當能流通。	Third, the distinction between the teaching and meaning within the profound sūtras. As for the teaching, it is generally entrusted to the śrāvakas. As for the meaning, it is entrusted to the bodhisattvas. Therefore, the text below says, Now I ask Ānanda to uphold the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra. The bhikṣu Ānanda has not yet heard it. The bodhisattva Hongguang will be able to spread it.
