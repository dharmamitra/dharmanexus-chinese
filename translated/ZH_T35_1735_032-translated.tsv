['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744a29_9']	說已默住、二「是時」下三家五請、三「爾時金剛藏觀察」下許說分齊。	說已默住、二「是時」下三家五請、三「爾時金剛藏觀察」下許說分齊。	032	after speaking, he remained silent; second, from At that time below, the three families made five requests; third, from At that time, Vajra Treasury observed below, the section on permission to speak.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b01_14']	所以默者，將欲演之，必固默之，欲令大眾渴仰請說故。	所以默者，將欲演之，必固默之，欲令大眾渴仰請說故。	032	The reason for remaining silent is that he will surely remain silent in order to expound it, causing the great assembly to yearn for the teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b02_8']	所以俟請者，略有二意：	所以俟請者，略有二意：	032	The reason for waiting for the request is roughly for two reasons:
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b02_18']	一增諸菩薩尊敬法故；	一增諸菩薩尊敬法故；	032	First, to increase the respect of the bodhisattvas for the Dharma;
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b04_6']	二前本分中舉地歎勝為增樂，欲令此請中生正解故。	二前本分中舉地歎勝為增樂，欲令此請中生正解故。	032	Second, in the previous fundamental section, praising the ground with praise increases the desire for joy, causing the request to give rise to correct understanding.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b04_11']	云何生解？	云何生解？	032	How does one give rise to understanding?
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b05_18']	謂由請故得說默之由，顯地體甚深離於言念，令眾先解；	謂由請故得說默之由，顯地體甚深離於言念，令眾先解；	032	That is to say, because of the request, one obtains the reason for speaking in silence, revealing that the essence of the ground is extremely profound and beyond words and thoughts, causing the assembly to first understand;
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b06_12']	後聞說分不隨聲取，離謬解故。	後聞說分不隨聲取，離謬解故。	032	Later, when hearing the section on speaking, one does not grasp according to the sound, avoiding mistaken understanding.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b07_9']	即復由此故，有第三示說分齊。	即復由此故，有第三示說分齊。	032	It is precisely because of this that there is a third section on demonstrating the limits of the teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b07_14']	初默可知。	初默可知。	032	The first silence can be understood.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b09_6']	第二請中，三家請殊，即分三段，謂初解脫月請、二大眾請、三如來請。	第二請中，三家請殊，即分三段，謂初解脫月請、二大眾請、三如來請。	032	In the second request, there are three different requests from three parties, which are divided into three parts, namely the first request by Liberation Moon, the second request by the great assembly, and the third request by the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b10_3']	所以要三家者，顯法深妙，令聞解故。	所以要三家者，顯法深妙，令聞解故。	032	The reason why three parties are necessary is to show that the Dharma is profound and wondrous, so that the listeners will understand.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b11_2']	眾首顯揚，當機渴仰，化主加勸，事方周故。	眾首顯揚，當機渴仰，化主加勸，事方周故。	032	The leader of the assembly proclaims it, the receptive audience eagerly looks up to it, and the teaching master encourages it, so that the matter is complete.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b11_12']	道大兼亡，法應請故。	道大兼亡，法應請故。	032	The Way is great and all-encompassing, and the Dharma should be requested.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b12_7']	為順請主，此眾堪聞，言不虛故。	為順請主，此眾堪聞，言不虛故。	032	In order to follow the requestor, this assembly is able to listen, and the words are not empty.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b13_7']	為成請者，如來護念而生信受，言有徵故。	為成請者，如來護念而生信受，言有徵故。	032	In order to accomplish the requestor, the Tathāgata's protection and remembrance give rise to faith and acceptance, and the words have evidence.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b13_20']	此約因請、生請，亦是次第。	此約因請、生請，亦是次第。	032	This is based on the request for causes and the request for birth, and is also in sequence.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b14_9']	又佛請者，即名為加。	又佛請者，即名為加。	032	Moreover, the Buddha's request is also called empowerment.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b15_7']	謂眾雖已請，要假主佛威光方堪說故。	謂眾雖已請，要假主佛威光方堪說故。	032	It means that although the assembly has already requested, it must rely on the majestic light of the main Buddha in order to be able to speak.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b16_8']	亦名為教，如來教說顯剛藏說，傳佛教故。	亦名為教，如來教說顯剛藏說，傳佛教故。	032	It is also called teaching, as the Tathāgata's teaching manifests through Vajragarbha's explanation, transmitting the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b17_4']	又前二家請，顯此地法因人修故；	又前二家請，顯此地法因人修故；	032	Moreover, the first two parties' requests show that the methods of this ground are cultivated by people,
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b17_18']	後一家請，顯此地法佛所證故。	後一家請，顯此地法佛所證故。	032	while the latter party's request shows that the methods of this ground are realized by the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b20_1']	前之二請餘經容有，後之一請餘經所無，《法華》三請但是一家，良以地法甚深寄位難說故。	前之二請餘經容有，後之一請餘經所無，《法華》三請但是一家，良以地法甚深寄位難說故。	032	The first two requests may be found in other sūtras, but the latter request is not found in other sūtras. The three requests in the Lotus Sūtra are only by one party. This is because the methods of the grounds are extremely profound and difficult to explain from a provisional position.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b21_4']	又三請次第者，初解脫月者，彼眾上首故，餘問則亂。	又三請次第者，初解脫月者，彼眾上首故，餘問則亂。	032	Moreover, the sequence of the three requests is as follows: First, Samantabhadra, as the leader of the assembly, requests. If others asked, it would be chaotic.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b21_13']	何緣大眾不亂問耶？	何緣大眾不亂問耶？	032	Why is it that the great assembly does not ask in a chaotic manner?
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b22_11']	眾調伏故，由前二止三請抑揚時眾故。	眾調伏故，由前二止三請抑揚時眾故。	032	Because the assembly is well-disciplined. Due to the two previous silences and three requests, the assembly is restrained and uplifted.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b24_1']	次眾請以表虔誠，然非爭起，依前請儀同聲齊請，故亦不亂。	次眾請以表虔誠，然非爭起，依前請儀同聲齊請，故亦不亂。	032	Next, the assembly requests to express their sincerity, but they do not rise up in competition. They request together in the same voice as before, so it is also not chaotic.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b24_13']	後聽說理窮，故如來勸說。	後聽說理窮，故如來勸說。	032	Finally, they listen to the explanation of the principle to the end, so the Tathāgata encourages the explanation.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b25_6']	今初眾首請中，總有三請。	今初眾首請中，總有三請。	032	Now, in the request by the leader of the assembly, there are three requests in total.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744b27_7']	所以三者，順世儀式，少不殷重、多則繁亂，正得中故，以止有三，抑揚當時，調伏機故。	所以三者，順世儀式，少不殷重、多則繁亂，正得中故，以止有三，抑揚當時，調伏機故。	032	The reason for three is to accord with worldly etiquette. If there are too few, it is not sincere; if there are too many, it is chaotic. Since it is just right, it ends with three. It restrains and elevates the present time, and subdues the faculties.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c01_11']	二家助成各唯一請，然依三請應分三段，若兼三止應分為六，以前默住之止，通為五請之本，不可唯屬於初，故止請相乘且為五段。	二家助成各唯一請，然依三請應分三段，若兼三止應分為六，以前默住之止，通為五請之本，不可唯屬於初，故止請相乘且為五段。	032	The two schools each have only one request to assist in accomplishing. However, according to the three requests, it should be divided into three sections. If the three stops are included, it should be divided into six, because the stop of remaining silent is the basis for the five requests, and cannot be limited to the first. Therefore, the stops and requests are combined into five sections.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c01_18']	一怪默騰疑請；	一怪默騰疑請；	032	1. The request to explain the doubt due to the strange silence;
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c02_6']	二法深難受止；	二法深難受止；	032	2. The stop due to the difficulty of receiving the profound Dharma;
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c02_13']	三歎眾堪聞請；	三歎眾堪聞請；	032	3. The request to praise the assembly's ability to hear;
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c03_14']	四不堪有損止，謂雖有堪者，亦有不堪故；	四不堪有損止，謂雖有堪者，亦有不堪故；	032	4. The stop due to the harm of inability, meaning that although there are those who are able, there are also those who are unable;
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c05_18']	五雙歎人法請，謂不堪聞者以法深故，亦得佛護，固應為說，於是剛藏理窮，更無違請。	五雙歎人法請，謂不堪聞者以法深故，亦得佛護，固應為說，於是剛藏理窮，更無違請。	032	5. The request to praise both the person and the Dharma, meaning that those who are unable to hear it are due to the profundity of the Dharma, and can also be protected by the Buddha, and should definitely be explained. Then, Vajra Treasury exhausted the principles and had no further requests to disobey.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c06_5']	就初請中分二：	就初請中分二：	032	In the first request, it is divided into two:

['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c07_10']	今初。	今初。	032	Now, the first.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c08_11']	言何因何緣者，疑怪之辭，為因說者不能說耶？	言何因何緣者，疑怪之辭，為因說者不能說耶？	032	The words what cause and what condition are words of doubt and wonder, doubting whether the reason is that the speaker is unable to speak,
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c09_3']	為緣聽者不堪聞耶？	為緣聽者不堪聞耶？	032	or whether the condition is that the listeners are unable to hear.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c09_14']	「金剛藏」下出所疑事。	「金剛藏」下出所疑事。	032	Vajra Treasury below lists the matters of doubt.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c10_2']	二騰疑為請，中二：	二騰疑為請，中二：	032	Second, raising the doubt and making a request, it is divided into two:

['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c12_17']	初偈說者無過，亦遣大眾何因之疑；	初偈說者無過，亦遣大眾何因之疑；	032	The first verse shows that the speaker has no fault, and also dispels the great assembly's doubt of what cause.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c13_14']	後四聽者無過，亦遣大眾何緣之疑。	後四聽者無過，亦遣大眾何緣之疑。	032	The last four show that the listeners have no fault, and also dispel the great assembly's doubt of what condition.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c15_6']	雖似初二，徵默所由為拂眾疑，後三請說為遂眾欲，文彰略耳。	雖似初二，徵默所由為拂眾疑，後三請說為遂眾欲，文彰略耳。	032	Although it seems that the first two verses are about the reason for the silence to dispel the assembly's doubts, and the last three request the teaching to fulfill the assembly's wishes, the text only shows a brief outline.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c15_16']	非不互通，故依前判。	非不互通，故依前判。	032	It is not that they do not mutually penetrate, and thus I rely on the previous analysis.

['ZH_T35_1735_032:0744c18_17']	聖德雖多，偏歎淨覺者，是說因故。	聖德雖多，偏歎淨覺者，是說因故。	032	Although the sage has many virtues, he praises pure awareness in particular because it is the cause of speech.

['ZH_T35_1735_032:0745c21_14']	二難見難得，亦非思慧心眼見故。	二難見難得，亦非思慧心眼見故。	032	Second, it is difficult to see and attain, also because it is not seen by the wisdom-eye of thought.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0745c23_13']	三離念難得，亦非世間修慧境故，以地智是於真修故，非地前心數分別緣修之境。	三離念難得，亦非世間修慧境故，以地智是於真修故，非地前心數分別緣修之境。	032	Third, it is difficult to attain by leaving behind thought, also because it is not the realm of worldly wisdom in cultivation. Because the wisdom of the stages is true cultivation, it is not the realm of conceptualized cultivation by the mind of the stage before the ground.

Not only is it not the realm of the stage before the ground, it is also not the realm of the wisdom of the path of cultivation that is naturally attained through rebirth for those who have ascended to the grounds. The consciousness of retribution that arises from transformation is called naturally attained through rebirth, and because one is able to know impermanence and so forth upon birth, it is called the wisdom of the path of cultivation that is naturally attained through rebirth. Because it is not the wisdom that illuminates reality, it also does not fathom the wisdom of the grounds.

This shows that it does not exist. It is said that wind on tree leaves can be seen because there are leaves to rely on, but the wind in space has no support and therefore cannot be seen.

['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c02_3']	以其客故者，出名無性不住所以。	以其客故者，出名無性不住所以。	032	Because it is a guest explains the reason why the nature of non-abiding is inexpressible.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c02_20']	謂名是實之賓，故無所住，無自性也。	謂名是實之賓，故無所住，無自性也。	032	It means that the name is a guest of reality, therefore it does not abide, it has no essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c03_15']	二合前非無，云非不於中有此言說。	二合前非無，云非不於中有此言說。	032	Second, it corresponds to the above not non-existent, saying not not in it is this verbal expression.

['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c06_15']	言說顯示下是能分別，合上空中事。	言說顯示下是能分別，合上空中事。	032	Verbal expression and display and below is what distinguishes, corresponding to the above things in the empty space.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c07_14']	以詮從旨，故亦難見，合上不可說處。	以詮從旨，故亦難見，合上不可說處。	032	Because the meaning is followed by the expression, it is also difficult to see, corresponding to the above inexpressible place.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c08_5']	然論佛智，即今經牟尼智。	然論佛智，即今經牟尼智。	032	However, the treatise's Buddha's wisdom is the Muni's wisdom in the present sūtra.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c09_2']	牟尼此云寂默，以智相即智性故。	牟尼此云寂默，以智相即智性故。	032	Muni means silent because the characteristic of wisdom is identical to the nature of wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c09_17']	此即地智而名佛智者，無二體故。	此即地智而名佛智者，無二體故。	032	The reason why the wisdom of the stage is called the wisdom of the Buddha is because there is no difference in essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c10_15']	亦是譯人見牟尼之言，謂是釋迦故耳。	亦是譯人見牟尼之言，謂是釋迦故耳。	032	This is also because the translator saw the word Muni and took it to mean Shakyamuni.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c11_15']	第三揀喻不同者，舉二喻者，喻旨別故。	第三揀喻不同者，舉二喻者，喻旨別故。	032	The third is the different analogies. The reason for using two analogies is that the meanings of the analogies are different.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c13_10']	論云畫者喻名字句依相說故，謂畫有相狀，如名句之屈曲，能顯地相。	論云畫者喻名字句依相說故，謂畫有相狀，如名句之屈曲，能顯地相。	032	The treatise says, Painting is used as an analogy because it illustrates the characteristics of names and phrases. That is to say, painting has a form, like the bending and curving of names and phrases that can manifest the characteristics of the stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c14_7']	風者以喻音聲，聲無屈曲如風之相。	風者以喻音聲，聲無屈曲如風之相。	032	Wind is used as an analogy for sound, because sound has no bending and curving, like the characteristics of wind.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c14_17']	假實既殊，故雙舉之。	假實既殊，故雙舉之。	032	Since the analogy and the real are different, both are mentioned.

Therefore, it is said that the speaker uses these two things to speak, and the listener uses these two things to listen. Therefore, two analogies are used to illustrate speaking and listening.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0746c17_15']	若將二喻喻所詮者，仍有兩重：	若將二喻喻所詮者，仍有兩重：	032	If the two analogies are used to illustrate what is being expounded, there are still two levels:

That is to say, following the teachings and practicing is called the purity of the scriptures, and realizing the principle and giving rise to practice is called the purity of realization.

Following the scriptures one thinks of, one attains the purity of mindfulness and awareness of skillful means, which means that attaining skillful means is called pure and clear, not grasping at the characteristics of mindfulness.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0747a14_6']	二善修諸行者求淨，三業敬順起求法行故。	二善修諸行者求淨，三業敬順起求法行故。	032	Second, well cultivating all practices is the purity of seeking. The three karmas respectfully follow and give rise to the practice of seeking the Dharma.

['ZH_T35_1735_032:0747a27_10']	相見道後至金剛無間道中皆是修道，復數修習無分別智，故名修道，滅二麁重皆使不行。	相見道後至金剛無間道中皆是修道，復數修習無分別智，故名修道，滅二麁重皆使不行。	032	From the time of the path of seeing up to the uninterrupted path of diamond-like concentration, it is all the path of cultivation. Again, one repeatedly cultivates nondiscriminating cognition, and therefore it is called the path of cultivation, which eliminates the two kinds of coarseness and makes them not occur.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0747a28_6']	對見道中初斷所知，故云垢染。	對見道中初斷所知，故云垢染。	032	In contrast to the initial elimination of the knowable on the path of seeing, it is called defiled.

Due to the power of intention, they may temporarily occur in the seven stages without being a fault. From the eighth stage on, they never occur again.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0747b04_12']	煩惱即是垢染，不行即是無有。	煩惱即是垢染，不行即是無有。	032	The passions are precisely the defilements, and not occurring again is precisely being nonexistent.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0747b05_8']	然見道中非不斷惑，見理義增；	然見道中非不斷惑，見理義增；	032	However, on the path of seeing, it is not that one does not eliminate the passions; the meaning of seeing the principle is predominant.
['ZH_T35_1735_032:0747b06_7']	修道位中審慮重觀，除障義勝，故此偏說。	修道位中審慮重觀，除障義勝，故此偏說。	032	In the stage of cultivation, one carefully considers and deeply contemplates, and the meaning of eliminating obstacles is superior, and therefore this [path of cultivation] is said to be biased [in this regard].
