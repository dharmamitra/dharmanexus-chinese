['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b09_17']	「為從」下，二、約無生行破一生受記。	「為從」下，二、約無生行破一生受記。	006	Is it from suchness that one is born? Below this is second, using the practice of non-arising to refute the prediction of one birth.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b10_11']	所以約行破者，乃由彌勒以有伏難。	所以約行破者，乃由彌勒以有伏難。	006	The reason for refuting it based on practice is because Maitreya has a counter-argument.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b10_14']	難云：	難云：	006	The argument states:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b11_1']	理無受記可然。	理無受記可然。	006	The principle of not receiving a prediction is reasonable.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b11_17']	何妨緣無生行，行成智斷得菩提記。	何妨緣無生行，行成智斷得菩提記。	006	How can it be that the conditions of the practice of non-arising do not obstruct the attainment of the prediction of bodhi through the completion of practice and the realization of wisdom and elimination?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b12_1']	文為四：	文為四：	006	The text is in four parts:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b12_17']	一雙定、二雙破、三雙並、四雙結。	一雙定、二雙破、三雙並、四雙結。	006	First, a double determination; second, a double refutation; third, a double parallel; fourth, a double conclusion.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b13_3']	一、雙定者，為從如生？	一、雙定者，為從如生？	006	First, the double determination: Is it from suchness that one is born?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b13_8']	為從如滅？	為從如滅？	006	Or is it from suchness that one ceases?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b14_13']	所以然者，彌勒情猶未愜，若無生理理即是如，無記不記。	所以然者，彌勒情猶未愜，若無生理理即是如，無記不記。	006	The reason for this is that Maitreya's feelings are still not satisfied. If there is no principle of arising, the principle is precisely suchness, and there is no prediction.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b15_7']	但眾生無始迷理，即有生死。	但眾生無始迷理，即有生死。	006	However, sentient beings have been deluded about the principle since beginningless time, and thus there is birth and death.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b17_8']	諸佛菩薩觀於無生，其真智明生則惑暗漸滅，若智生照極則妄惑斯盡，智斷滿足名菩提果。	諸佛菩薩觀於無生，其真智明生則惑暗漸滅，若智生照極則妄惑斯盡，智斷滿足名菩提果。	006	Buddhas and bodhisattvas contemplate non-arising, and as their true wisdom illuminates, the darkness of delusion gradually ceases. If wisdom arises and illumination is perfected, then false delusions are exhausted. When wisdom and cessation are fulfilled, it is called the fruit of bodhi.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b17_17']	豈事如理呵有受記？	豈事如理呵有受記？	006	How can it be like the principle of scolding and receiving predictions?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b18_16']	故先雙定為如生如滅智斷果滿得受記耶？	故先雙定為如生如滅智斷果滿得受記耶？	006	Therefore, first, both are determined: is it like arising, like cessation, wisdom, cutting off, fulfilling the fruit, and receiving predictions?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b19_18']	就此雙定，玄約三教菩薩如生如滅智斷受記。	就此雙定，玄約三教菩薩如生如滅智斷受記。	006	In this double determination, the profound is based on the three teachings of bodhisattvas, like arising, like cessation, wisdom, cutting off, and receiving predictions.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b21_12']	若通別教，一往事同而理有異，通圓二教事理俱異，與別教理同而事異。	若通別教，一往事同而理有異，通圓二教事理俱異，與別教理同而事異。	006	If it is the shared and distinct teachings, the events are generally the same, but the principle has differences. In the two teachings of the shared and perfect teachings, both events and principles are different, with the principle being the same as the distinct teaching, but the events being different.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b21_14']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b22_3']	別圓何得理同事異？	別圓何得理同事異？	006	How can the distinct and perfect teachings have the same principle but different events?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b22_5']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b22_19']	同是中道故同，兩修之別故異。	同是中道故同，兩修之別故異。	006	They are the same because they are both the middle way, and they are different because of the difference in the two cultivations.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b23_12']	「若以至有滅」，二、雙難。	「若以至有滅」，二、雙難。	006	If it is like up to the cessation of existence, second, a double difficulty.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b24_1']	既默然受定，即約行雙難。	既默然受定，即約行雙難。	006	Since he silently accepts the determination, he then uses the double difficulty based on practice.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b25_7']	亦玄約三教智斷一生受菩提記，即約偏圓二真以雙難也。	亦玄約三教智斷一生受菩提記，即約偏圓二真以雙難也。	006	It also uses the three teachings' wisdom and elimination to receive the prediction of bodhi in one life, and uses the two truths of biased and perfect to pose a double difficulty.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b26_9']	一約通教者，通教偏真即是真如理，理非智斷。	一約通教者，通教偏真即是真如理，理非智斷。	006	As for the first, regarding the shared teaching, the biased truth of the shared teaching is precisely the principle of suchness. The principle is not wisdom or elimination.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b28_6']	若觀真如即智生惑滅，如雖無生而能發智，智從如生生不離如，即是如生之智德。	若觀真如即智生惑滅，如雖無生而能發智，智從如生生不離如，即是如生之智德。	006	If one contemplates suchness, wisdom arises and delusions are extinguished. Although suchness is unborn, it can give rise to wisdom. Wisdom arises from suchness, and arising does not depart from suchness. This is precisely the virtue of wisdom that arises from suchness.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b29_9']	如雖非滅，見如惑滅，滅不離如，即是如滅之斷德。	如雖非滅，見如惑滅，滅不離如，即是如滅之斷德。	006	Although suchness is not extinguished, seeing suchness extinguishes delusions. Extinguishment does not depart from suchness. This is precisely the virtue of elimination that is extinguished by suchness.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638b29_15']	今淨名難言：	今淨名難言：	006	Now Vimalakīrti poses the difficulty, saying:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c01_16']	若以如生如滅得受記者，從如有生，如無有生；	若以如生如滅得受記者，從如有生，如無有生；	006	If one receives the prediction by means of the arising of suchness and the extinguishment of suchness, then from the existence of suchness there is the arising of suchness;🔽from the non-existence of suchness there is the non-arising of suchness;
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c02_6']	從如有滅，如無有滅。	從如有滅，如無有滅。	006	from the existence of suchness there is the extinguishment of suchness; from the non-existence of suchness there is the non-extinguishment of suchness.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c03_9']	難意正言如體非生非滅，約如說生說滅有智斷之德。	難意正言如體非生非滅，約如說生說滅有智斷之德。	006	The meaning of the difficulty is precisely that the essence of suchness is neither arising nor extinguishing. Speaking of arising and extinguishing in terms of suchness has the virtues of wisdom and elimination.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c04_4']	如若生滅則不名如，即是世諦。	如若生滅則不名如，即是世諦。	006	If suchness arises and extinguishes, then it is not called suchness. This is precisely the conventional truth.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c05_18']	若非生滅非世諦者，即真無生滅，是則如非生滅，不得說從如有生滅之智斷。	若非生滅非世諦者，即真無生滅，是則如非生滅，不得說從如有生滅之智斷。	006	If it is not arising and ceasing, not conventional truth, then it is truly unborn and unceasing. In that case, suchness is unborn and unceasing, and one cannot say that from suchness arises the wisdom of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c06_14']	故淨名言「從如有生，如無有生；	故淨名言「從如有生，如無有生；	006	Therefore Vimalakīrti said, From suchness arises, suchness has no arising;
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c07_2']	從如有滅，如無有滅。	從如有滅，如無有滅。	006	from suchness ceases, suchness has no ceasing.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c08_5']	」若如無生滅不成智斷者，豈得離如別有生滅智斷？	」若如無生滅不成智斷者，豈得離如別有生滅智斷？	006	If suchness has no arising and ceasing, it does not constitute wisdom and severance. How can one apart from suchness have a wisdom and severance that arises and ceases?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c09_5']	是則無有約無生行可以受一生智斷之記。	是則無有約無生行可以受一生智斷之記。	006	In that case, there is no practice of non-arising according to which one can receive the prediction of the wisdom and severance of one birth.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c10_5']	復次由能緣無生之心成智斷，智即是自生；	復次由能緣無生之心成智斷，智即是自生；	006	Furthermore, if the mind that contemplates non-arising constitutes wisdom and severance, wisdom is then self-arisen;
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c10_16']	若由所緣理，即是他生；	若由所緣理，即是他生；	006	if it is due to the principle that is contemplated, then it is other-arisen;
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c11_6']	若能所合，即是共生；	若能所合，即是共生；	006	if the subject and object are combined, then it is co-arisen;
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c11_20']	若離能所，即是無因生之智斷。	若離能所，即是無因生之智斷。	006	if apart from subject and object, then it is wisdom and severance that arises without cause.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c13_8']	故龍樹偈云「諸法不自生」，豈得能緣真如之心生智斷而得受記？	故龍樹偈云「諸法不自生」，豈得能緣真如之心生智斷而得受記？	006	Therefore Nāgârjuna's verse says, Dharmas do not arise from themselves, how can the mind that contemplates suchness give rise to wisdom and severance and receive the prediction?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c14_18']	乃至不無因生，並如初句，皆引《中論》偈成四句之中正破他生。	乃至不無因生，並如初句，皆引《中論》偈成四句之中正破他生。	006	Up to not without arising from a cause, all are like the first sentence, all citing the verses of the Middle Treatise to accomplish the correct refutation of other-production within the four sentences.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c14_21']	何者？	何者？	006	What is it?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c16_18']	彌勒謂因如發智成智斷行者得受記，故二雙難別圓兩教，一一類通教難覈勿失一句。	彌勒謂因如發智成智斷行者得受記，故二雙難別圓兩教，一一類通教難覈勿失一句。	006	Maitreya said that the practitioner who attains the wisdom of realizing the truth through causes receives the prediction, therefore the two pairs of difficulties are the difficulties of the two teachings of the Distinct and the Perfect, each corresponding to the teaching of the Shared.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c17_15']	但通別二教，通緣偏真、別教緣修。	但通別二教，通緣偏真、別教緣修。	006	But the two teachings of the Shared and the Distinct correspond to the biased truth, and the teaching of the Distinct corresponds to the conditioned.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c18_10']	又別教緣修為自、圓教真修為自。	又別教緣修為自、圓教真修為自。	006	Moreover, the conditioned of the teaching of the Distinct is the self, and the true cultivation of the teaching of the Perfect is the self.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c18_15']	慎勿濫也。	慎勿濫也。	006	Be careful not to confuse them.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c19_14']	問何以通別以緣修為自、圓教以真修為自？	問何以通別以緣修為自、圓教以真修為自？	006	Question: Why is the conditioned of the Shared and the Distinct considered the self, and the true cultivation of the teaching of the Perfect considered the self?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c19_16']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c20_13']	通別用智成佛，如但是境，故緣是自。	通別用智成佛，如但是境，故緣是自。	006	The Shared and the Distinct use wisdom to attain Buddhahood, as suchness is merely the object, therefore the conditioned is the self.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c21_13']	圓用真成佛，緣修但是福慧莊嚴，故真如為自。	圓用真成佛，緣修但是福慧莊嚴，故真如為自。	006	The Perfect uses the true to attain Buddhahood, and the conditioned cultivation is merely the adornment of merit and wisdom, therefore suchness is the self.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c21_15']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c22_19']	通教既是斷無之真，發智而已，智是行人，說之為自。	通教既是斷無之真，發智而已，智是行人，說之為自。	006	Since the Shared Teaching is the true cessation of non-existence, it only gives rise to wisdom. Wisdom is the practitioner, and it is called self.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c23_8']	理但是境，可得是他。	理但是境，可得是他。	006	The principle is only the object, and it can be called other.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c24_2']	別明中理，何不同圓而同通教？	別明中理，何不同圓而同通教？	006	Why is the distinct explanation of the middle principle not the same as the Perfect Teaching, but the same as the Shared Teaching?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c24_4']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c24_14']	理雖同圓，機教不等。	理雖同圓，機教不等。	006	Although the principle is the same as the Perfect Teaching, the capacity and teaching are not equal.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c26_10']	別明緣真，真雖是常，而理非智，用智觀理未發真智，緣修之智不名為常，故不同圓。	別明緣真，真雖是常，而理非智，用智觀理未發真智，緣修之智不名為常，故不同圓。	006	The distinct explanation of the conditioned arising of truth, although truth is permanent, the principle is not wisdom. Using wisdom to contemplate the principle, before the true wisdom arises, the wisdom of conditioned arising is not called permanent, therefore it is not the same as the Perfect Teaching.

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c28_1']	圓以真為自，四句云何？	圓以真為自，四句云何？	006	In the Perfect Teaching, taking truth as self, what are the four propositions?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0638c28_3']	答：	答：	006	Answer:

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a02_13']	若四句撿智斷叵得，則無受圓教一生之記。	若四句撿智斷叵得，則無受圓教一生之記。	006	If the wisdom and elimination are unobtainable through the four propositions, then one cannot receive the prediction of one life in the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a04_2']	但淨名難意難圓自生真修智斷，是中窮覈非兩十番之所能。	但淨名難意難圓自生真修智斷，是中窮覈非兩十番之所能。	006	But the meaning of Vimalakīrti's criticism is to criticize the true cultivation of wisdom and elimination in the perfect teaching. The thorough investigation here cannot be done by the two sets of ten approaches.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a04_18']	夫不深見此意，圓教真修義則難存。	夫不深見此意，圓教真修義則難存。	006	Those who do not deeply see this meaning find it difficult to preserve the meaning of true cultivation in the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a05_12']	圓真尚爾，通別緣修豈易可存？	圓真尚爾，通別緣修豈易可存？	006	If the true in the perfect is still like this, how can the conditioned cultivation in the shared and distinct teachings be easily preserved?

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a07_13']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a09_6']	昔還陜鄉，見導因寺張公為梁宣帝於大殿北壁畫一鋪盧舍那，并畫一龜。	昔還陜鄉，見導因寺張公為梁宣帝於大殿北壁畫一鋪盧舍那，并畫一龜。	006	In the past, when I returned to my hometown in Shaanxi, I saw that Zhang Gong of Duyin Temple painted a Vairocana and a turtle on the north wall of the main hall for Emperor Xuan of Liang.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a10_4']	其像兩眼隨人動止皆悉視人，龜眼亦爾。	其像兩眼隨人動止皆悉視人，龜眼亦爾。	006	The two eyes of the image followed the person's movements and looked at the person, and the eyes of the turtle were also like this.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a11_7']	世色法妙尚能如是，豈況淨名住不思議之妙智也。	世色法妙尚能如是，豈況淨名住不思議之妙智也。	006	The wonderful Dharma of the worldly form can still be like this, how much more so for Vimalakīrti's dwelling in the wonderful wisdom of the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a12_6']	一番所難，令三各破執心之患自捨者哉。	一番所難，令三各破執心之患自捨者哉。	006	The difficulty raised in one place is to make the three each break the affliction of grasping the mind and abandon it by themselves.

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0639a18_14']	順並者，眾生即假人，假人如與彌勒如一如無二如。	順並者，眾生即假人，假人如與彌勒如一如無二如。	006	As for sequential comparison, sentient beings are the provisional person, the suchness of the provisional person is the same suchness as the suchness of Maitreya, one suchness without two suchnesses.

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649b22_12']	初意者，淨名住不思議權謀，輔翼大聖，顯不思議真性解脫，助成佛國因果之教。	初意者，淨名住不思議權謀，輔翼大聖，顯不思議真性解脫，助成佛國因果之教。	006	The first meaning is that Vimalakīrti abides in inconceivable expedient wisdom, assisting the Great Sage, manifesting inconceivable true nature liberation, and aiding in the teaching of the causes and effects of the Buddha's land.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649b26_5']	前已用四教折伏凡夫二乘及諸偏菩薩，今歎圓教三脫之果，接引攝受，令修三觀之因入不思議解脫，得見淨剎隨業往生成淨土之行，故有此品及下五品。	前已用四教折伏凡夫二乘及諸偏菩薩，今歎圓教三脫之果，接引攝受，令修三觀之因入不思議解脫，得見淨剎隨業往生成淨土之行，故有此品及下五品。	006	Previously, using the four teachings to subdue ordinary beings, the two vehicles, and biased bodhisattvas, now praising the fruit of the perfect teaching's three liberations, guiding and accepting them, causing them to cultivate the causes of the three contemplations and enter inconceivable liberation, seeing the pure lands and being reborn according to karma, thus forming the practice of the Pure Land. Therefore, there are this chapter and the following five chapters.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649b26_10']	此又為五：	此又為五：	006	This is also divided into five parts:

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c01_13']	初意者，雖諸王、士庶、弟子、菩薩稱述大士勝智勝德，大眾虛心渴仰而已，未獲見聞。	初意者，雖諸王、士庶、弟子、菩薩稱述大士勝智勝德，大眾虛心渴仰而已，未獲見聞。	006	The first meaning is that although the kings, officials, disciples, and bodhisattvas praise the great being's superior wisdom and virtues, the great assembly only yearns with an empty mind and has not yet attained seeing and hearing.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c04_14']	若得問疾之人，隨從親承，即得見聞大士神智、詫疾興教利物之事，是故奉命赴時眾之心，令見詫疾空室所表，聞說不思議權實兩疾。	若得問疾之人，隨從親承，即得見聞大士神智、詫疾興教利物之事，是故奉命赴時眾之心，令見詫疾空室所表，聞說不思議權實兩疾。	006	If one who is able to ask about the illness follows and personally serves, one will then be able to see and hear the great being's spiritual wisdom, the matter of the teaching arising from the illness to benefit beings. Therefore, one respectfully receives the order and responds to the minds of the assembly at the time, allowing them to see the empty room that the illness represents, and to hear the inconceivable provisional and real two illnesses.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c06_13']	次意者，室外彈呵諸稟偏教未入正位，及諸凡夫雖復心折慕仰正道而莫知修入方軌。	次意者，室外彈呵諸稟偏教未入正位，及諸凡夫雖復心折慕仰正道而莫知修入方軌。	006	The second meaning is that outside the room, those who receive biased teachings and have not yet entered the correct position, as well as ordinary beings, although their minds are broken and they yearn for the correct path, they do not know the method of cultivation and entry.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c08_13']	若文殊入室問有疾菩薩云何調伏其心，淨名略廣明三觀調伏，即是攝受引入義也。	若文殊入室問有疾菩薩云何調伏其心，淨名略廣明三觀調伏，即是攝受引入義也。	006	If Mañjuśrī enters the room and asks the bodhisattva who is sick how to subdue his mind, and Vimalakīrti briefly and extensively clarifies the three contemplations for subduing, this is the meaning of embracing and leading in.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c10_10']	三意者，若因文殊問疾，能修三觀，隨障盡多少各生淨土，所有願行皆成淨土之行。	三意者，若因文殊問疾，能修三觀，隨障盡多少各生淨土，所有願行皆成淨土之行。	006	The third meaning is that if one is able to cultivate the three contemplations due to Mañjuśrī's inquiry about illness, then according to the amount of afflictions exhausted one will each be born in a pure land, and all vows and practices will be the practice of the pure land.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c13_11']	四意者，若已入正位，前雖聞大乘猶未轉酪，今因文殊入室更聞六品之說即轉成生蘇，故迦葉云「今諸聲聞皆應號泣」，即其事也。	四意者，若已入正位，前雖聞大乘猶未轉酪，今因文殊入室更聞六品之說即轉成生蘇，故迦葉云「今諸聲聞皆應號泣」，即其事也。	006	The fourth meaning is that if one has already entered the correct stage, although one has previously heard the Mahayana it has not yet turned into curd. Now due to Mañjuśrī entering the room and hearing the teachings of the six chapters, it will turn into fresh butter. Therefore Kāśyapa says, Now all the śrāvakas should all wail, and this is the matter.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c14_13']	若至《大品》得為熟蘇，《法華》、《涅槃》即成醍醐。	若至《大品》得為熟蘇，《法華》、《涅槃》即成醍醐。	006	If one reaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, it becomes mature butter, and the Lotus Sūtra and Nirvāṇa Sūtra then become ghee.

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c20_1']	五意者，若不因文殊問疾入室與淨名往復說六品竟，豈得掌擎大眾還菴羅園，對佛印定前後所說，起發阿難對佛廣明淨土，接妙喜界來入此國，令諸大眾皆得見聞發願往生修無動行。	五意者，若不因文殊問疾入室與淨名往復說六品竟，豈得掌擎大眾還菴羅園，對佛印定前後所說，起發阿難對佛廣明淨土，接妙喜界來入此國，令諸大眾皆得見聞發願往生修無動行。	006	The five meanings are: If it were not for Mañjuśrī asking about his illness, entering the room, and having a dialogue with Vimalakīrti, explaining the six chapters, how could he hold the great assembly in his palm and return to the mango grove, facing the Buddha, confirming what was said before and after, inspiring Ānanda to explain the pure land in detail to the Buddha, bringing the wonderful and joyful world to enter this country, causing the great assembly to all see and hear, make vows to be reborn, and cultivate unmoving practices?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c21_18']	是則結撮淨名室外室內所有闡揚，皆扶成大聖不思議解脫法身淨佛國土因果之教。	是則結撮淨名室外室內所有闡揚，皆扶成大聖不思議解脫法身淨佛國土因果之教。	006	This then concludes the teachings of Vimalakīrti's room and inner room, all supporting and accomplishing the inconceivable liberation and Dharma body of the great sage, the teaching of the causes and effects of purifying the Buddha's lands.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c23_10']	二、明文殊堪為問疾人者，上命五百及諸菩薩，各述被彈皆辭不堪。	二、明文殊堪為問疾人者，上命五百及諸菩薩，各述被彈皆辭不堪。	006	Second, explaining why Mañjuśrī is suitable to ask about his illness, above he was ordered to go with the five hundred and various bodhisattvas, each recounting their being scolded and all declining the task.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c24_7']	今文殊獨堪承佛聖旨者，略出五意：	今文殊獨堪承佛聖旨者，略出五意：	006	Now, why is it that only Mañjuśrī is able to carry out the Buddha's holy decree? Briefly presenting five meanings:

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c26_9']	一位高者，文殊與諸菩薩雖同居等覺，不無高下。	一位高者，文殊與諸菩薩雖同居等覺，不無高下。	006	First, in terms of rank, although Mañjuśrī and the bodhisattvas are all in the stage of equal enlightenment, there are still differences in rank.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c27_12']	故《瓔珞》云「住等覺位入重玄門，經無量劫倒修凡事。	故《瓔珞》云「住等覺位入重玄門，經無量劫倒修凡事。	006	Therefore, the Ornament of the Sutra of Brahma's Net says, Abiding in the stage of equal enlightenment, entering the profound gate, and practicing ordinary matters for immeasurable eons.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c28_17']	」文殊修行積久、智德高勝，位等淨名，故堪為問疾人也。	」文殊修行積久、智德高勝，位等淨名，故堪為問疾人也。	006	Mañjuśrī's cultivation has been long, and his wisdom and virtue are superior. His rank is equal to that of Vimalakīrti, so he is suitable to ask about his illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0649c29_3']	此亦一往也。	此亦一往也。	006	This is also a one-sided explanation.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a02_11']	二、垂迹者，諸菩薩多是實位補處，但文殊本地是龍種如來、今迹居補處，與淨名本迹義齊，故堪問疾人也。	二、垂迹者，諸菩薩多是實位補處，但文殊本地是龍種如來、今迹居補處，與淨名本迹義齊，故堪問疾人也。	006	Second, in terms of manifesting traces, the bodhisattvas are mostly in the stage of true rank and are only substitutes. However, Mañjuśrī's original ground is the Tathāgata of the Dragon Species, and now he manifests as a substitute. His meaning of original and manifested traces is the same as Vimalakīrti's, so he is suitable to ask about his illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a02_17']	又一往明耳。	又一往明耳。	006	This is also a one-sided explanation.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a04_8']	三、顯圓者，菩薩本迹豈可定測，但諸菩薩多示弘方便，故悉為所彈。	三、顯圓者，菩薩本迹豈可定測，但諸菩薩多示弘方便，故悉為所彈。	006	Third, in terms of revealing the perfect, how can the original and manifested traces of the bodhisattvas be definitively measured? However, the bodhisattvas mostly manifest the promotion of skillful means, so they are all reprimanded.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a05_10']	文殊多示弘圓教，與淨名事同，故堪為問疾人也。	文殊多示弘圓教，與淨名事同，故堪為問疾人也。	006	Mañjuśrī mostly manifests the promotion of the perfect teaching, and his affairs are the same as Vimalakīrti's, so he is suitable to ask about his illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a05_12']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a06_2']	若爾，何得為鴦掘所折？	若爾，何得為鴦掘所折？	006	If so, how could he be defeated by Aṅgulimāla?

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a06_14']	事等從多，鴦掘從少。	事等從多，鴦掘從少。	006	The matter is equal, following the majority. Aṅgulimāla follows the minority.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a07_11']	文殊未為淨名所彈，今承聖旨於義無妨。	文殊未為淨名所彈，今承聖旨於義無妨。	006	Mañjuśrī has not yet been refuted by Vimalakīrti. Now, following the holy meaning, there is no obstruction in the principle.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a07_20']	四、愜物情者，問：	四、愜物情者，問：	006	Fourth, in terms of satisfying the feelings of beings, the question is:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a08_14']	諸菩薩同輔大師，何得全不愜物情？	諸菩薩同輔大師，何得全不愜物情？	006	Since all the bodhisattvas equally assist the Great Teacher, how could they completely fail to satisfy the feelings of beings?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a08_16']	答：	答：	006	The answer is:
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a11_9']	彌勒雖是補處而是右面侍者，諸菩薩事儀疎外，文殊雖同居補處而是左面侍者，如左面大臣裁斷自在，故愜物情。	彌勒雖是補處而是右面侍者，諸菩薩事儀疎外，文殊雖同居補處而是左面侍者，如左面大臣裁斷自在，故愜物情。	006	Although Maitreya is the one who will succeed the position of Śākyamuni, he is the attendant on the right side. The bodhisattvas are distant from the ceremonial procedures. Although Mañjuśrī is the same in succeeding the position, he is the attendant on the left side. Like a minister on the left side who makes independent decisions, he therefore satisfies the feelings of beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a14_12']	五、隨物機者，諸菩薩與淨名如砧槌成物，今文殊與淨名如兩槌成物，故入室往復辭無屈滯，悅可眾心為淨名稱歎，豈同諸菩薩發言被折？	五、隨物機者，諸菩薩與淨名如砧槌成物，今文殊與淨名如兩槌成物，故入室往復辭無屈滯，悅可眾心為淨名稱歎，豈同諸菩薩發言被折？	006	Fifth, in terms of following the capacities of beings, the bodhisattvas are like a hammer and anvil for Vimalakīrti to shape beings. Now, Mañjuśrī and Vimalakīrti are like two hammers shaping beings. Therefore, entering the room and going back and forth, his words are without any obstruction or stagnation. Pleasing the minds of the assembly is praised by Vimalakīrti. How could it be the same as the bodhisattvas speaking and being refuted?
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a15_4']	以是諸義堪為問疾人也。	以是諸義堪為問疾人也。	006	For these reasons, he is worthy of being the one to inquire about Vimalakīrti's illness.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a15_11']	三、釋權實者。	三、釋權實者。	006	Third, explaining the expedient and the real.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0650a16_4']	疾義雖多，原其正意不出權實。	疾義雖多，原其正意不出權實。	006	Although there are many meanings of illness, the original intention is not beyond the expedient and the real.

Due to those illnesses, Vimalakīrti also has the expedient illnesses of the causes and effects of the six kinds. If these illnesses are cured, then Vimalakīrti is also cured.

He also wanted to reiterate the events of the previous rebuke, all in order to support and continue the teachings on the Pure Land.🔽Now that Mañjuśrī has come, the reason he manifested the appearance of the empty room is to illustrate that the Buddha lands are all empty, and he wants to have an extensive discussion of the Buddha lands with Mañjuśrī, which is to continue the previous.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0652c28_14']	二、生後者，若現空室表佛國皆空，文殊知表，因即往復論佛國義，故於此品即得明佛國也。	二、生後者，若現空室表佛國皆空，文殊知表，因即往復論佛國義，故於此品即得明佛國也。	006	Second, giving rise to the later means that if he manifested the empty room to illustrate that the Buddha lands are all empty, and Mañjuśrī understood the illustration, he would then go back and forth to discuss the meaning of the Buddha lands, so in this chapter he would be able to clarify the Buddha lands.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0653a01_3']	又因空室，身子為眾須床、念食，時眾得見燈王佛土、香積淨剎。	又因空室，身子為眾須床、念食，時眾得見燈王佛土、香積淨剎。	006	Moreover, due to the empty room, Śāriputra needed a bed for the assembly and thought of food, and then the assembly got to see the Buddha Land of Dīpaṃkara and the pure realm of Fragrant Accumulation.

He initiated the Tathāgata to extensively explain the chapter on the practice of bodhisattvas, clarifying the causes and effects of the Buddha lands, and the chapter on seeing Akṣobhya Buddha. Immeasurable great assemblies saw that Buddha land, and based on this they gave rise to the intention to cultivate the practice of Akṣobhya Buddha's pure land and be reborn in that land. All of this was established by the empty room manifesting signs, which immediately gave rise to the latter part.

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0653a10_13']	若穢不空則不可破壞，以穢業空故依報可除，即是除諸所有、破諸魔外愛見正報，即是及諸侍者。	若穢不空則不可破壞，以穢業空故依報可除，即是除諸所有、破諸魔外愛見正報，即是及諸侍者。	006	If defilements were not empty, they would be indestructible. Since defiled karma is empty, the dependent environment can be removed, which is the same as removing all that exists and destroying the love and views of demons and outsiders in the direct reward. This is the same as the attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0653a12_9']	次表同居淨土，雖無雜穢依報、魔外正報，而有分段清淨依報、分段愛見正報。	次表同居淨土，雖無雜穢依報、魔外正報，而有分段清淨依報、分段愛見正報。	006	Next, it illustrates the pure land of the shared realm, which although has no mixed defiled dependent environment or demons and outsiders in the direct reward, it has the pure dependent environment of the segmented and the love and views of the segmented in the direct reward.

With the power of wisdom, he eliminated the karma of the segmented direct and dependent rewards, so it says removing all that exists and the attendants.

Although there are no segmented defiled direct and dependent rewards, there are the dependent environment of transformation and the unconditioned direct reward, which are the love and views of demons and outsiders.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0653a16_17']	故淨名呵須菩提云「同於煩惱入諸邪見」。	故淨名呵須菩提云「同於煩惱入諸邪見」。	006	Therefore, Vimalakīrti scolded Subhūti, saying, You are the same as the afflictions and enter all wrong views.

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0653a21_9']	淨名應生，知國即空，用智慧力除彼依正，故言除去所有及諸侍者。	淨名應生，知國即空，用智慧力除彼依正，故言除去所有及諸侍者。	006	Vimalakīrti responded to birth in that land, knowing the country to be empty, and used the power of wisdom to remove their dependent and correct [aspects], therefore saying removing all possessions and attendants.
['ZH_T38_1778_006:0653a23_11']	次常寂光國，究竟清淨空無所有，即是極地所居，無可除斷，故《大經》明無所斷者名無上士。	次常寂光國，究竟清淨空無所有，即是極地所居，無可除斷，故《大經》明無所斷者名無上士。	006	Next, in the eternally quiescent and illuminated land, ultimate purity is empty and has nothing whatsoever, which is the ultimate stage of dwelling, with nothing to be removed or severed. Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra clarifies that those who have nothing to sever are called the unsurpassed person.

['ZH_T38_1778_006:0653a26_8']	故《地持》明二障斷時離一切見清淨淨禪，此即其義。	故《地持》明二障斷時離一切見清淨淨禪，此即其義。	006	Therefore, the Bodhisattvabhūmi Sūtra clarifies that when the two hindrances are severed, one is free from all views and has pure meditation, which is precisely the meaning of this [passage].

Based on this, he can discuss the two kinds of illnesses, real and expedient, which are the teachings of the Tathāgata and the reprimands of Vimalakīrti, and the supporting teachings are all clearly revealed.
