['ZH_T39_1786_06a:0152a21_14']	慈心治嗔者，嗔既通於界內界外，能治慈觀不獨觀於眾生作父母想與世間樂，觀一切法無性無相能與眾生涅槃之樂，觀一切法無非法界能與眾生究竟之樂，以此治於三種嗔心，是故釋論明三種慈也。	慈心治嗔者，嗔既通於界內界外，能治慈觀不獨觀於眾生作父母想與世間樂，觀一切法無性無相能與眾生涅槃之樂，觀一切法無非法界能與眾生究竟之樂，以此治於三種嗔心，是故釋論明三種慈也。	06a	As for using a compassionate mind to treat anger, since anger extends to both within and outside the realms, the contemplation of compassion that can treat it is not only the contemplation of all beings as one's parents, giving rise to the happiness of the world, but also the contemplation of all dharmas as having no nature and no characteristics, which can give rise to the happiness of nirvāṇa for all beings, and the contemplation of all dharmas as being none other than the dharma realm, which can give rise to the ultimate happiness for all beings. Using these to treat the three kinds of angry minds, this is why the Śāstra on the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra explains the three kinds of compassion.
['ZH_T39_1786_06a:0152a24_6']	不淨治貪者，不獨修於實想假想破於凡夫依正之染，亦能破於二乘涅槃之染，亦破菩薩執於次第三諦之染。	不淨治貪者，不獨修於實想假想破於凡夫依正之染，亦能破於二乘涅槃之染，亦破菩薩執於次第三諦之染。	06a	The purification of greed by impurity not only cultivates the real and provisional thoughts to break through the defilements of the ordinary person's reliance on the correct, but also can break through the defilements of the two vehicles' nirvana, and also break through the bodhisattva's attachment to the three levels of truth.

['ZH_T39_1786_06a:0152a28_14']	因緣治癡者，不獨觀於三世無常因果破於凡夫斷常之癡，亦能次第觀於三諦十二因緣破於二乘有無之癡，又能一心觀於四種十二因緣破於菩薩縱橫之癡。	因緣治癡者，不獨觀於三世無常因果破於凡夫斷常之癡，亦能次第觀於三諦十二因緣破於二乘有無之癡，又能一心觀於四種十二因緣破於菩薩縱橫之癡。	06a	The purification of delusion by causes and conditions not only observes the impermanence of the three periods of time and the causes and effects to break through the delusion of ordinary people's annihilation and permanence, but also can sequentially observe the three levels of truth and the twelve links of dependent arising to break through the delusion of the two vehicles' existence and non-existence, and can also observe the four kinds of twelve links of dependent arising with one mind to break through the bodhisattva's vertical and horizontal delusion.
['ZH_T39_1786_06a:0152a29_12']	是故《大經》觀十二因緣具四種智也。	是故《大經》觀十二因緣具四種智也。	06a	Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra observes the twelve links of dependent arising and possesses the four kinds of wisdom.

Moreover, it can realize that each breath in counting the breath is the middle way, and all dharmas lead to the breath to break through the distracted mind of bodhisattvas on the two extremes.
['ZH_T39_1786_06a:0152b05_16']	故《請觀音》於數息法得三乘道、住首楞嚴身，如瑠璃毛孔見佛。	故《請觀音》於數息法得三乘道、住首楞嚴身，如瑠璃毛孔見佛。	06a	Therefore, in the Request to Avalokiteśvara it is said that by the method of counting the breath one attains the path of the three vehicles and abides in the śūraṃgama body, like seeing the Buddha in the crystal-like pores.

These three can be based on the sequence or non-sequence.

How much more so are loving-kindness and the other four not the three contemplations?
