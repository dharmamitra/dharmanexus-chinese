['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a13_15']	理須消釋使義相當，然下諸品並是流通本迹二門，所以此中雖於對治中雙消二意，義亦通於餘之三悉，以〈隨喜品〉文既校量滅後五品之初，義當現在四信之首，並由聞長壽增益品秩，故須雙述今昔二門。	理須消釋使義相當，然下諸品並是流通本迹二門，所以此中雖於對治中雙消二意，義亦通於餘之三悉，以〈隨喜品〉文既校量滅後五品之初，義當現在四信之首，並由聞長壽增益品秩，故須雙述今昔二門。	10b	It is necessary to explain the principles so that the meanings correspond. However, the following chapters are all about circulating the two gates of the present and the traces. Therefore, although here it explains the two meanings in the counteraction aspect, the meaning also applies to the other three aspects. Because the text of the chapter on rejoicing compares the first of the five categories after the extinction of the Dharma, the meaning corresponds to the first of the four faiths in the present. It is all due to hearing the long life and increasing the rank of the chapters, so it is necessary to explain the two gates of the present and the past.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a16_3']	下〈法師功德品〉，正當現在四信之位及隨喜後位，所以不復雙存兩釋，由〈分別〉中及〈隨喜〉中已具釋竟。	下〈法師功德品〉，正當現在四信之位及隨喜後位，所以不復雙存兩釋，由〈分別〉中及〈隨喜〉中已具釋竟。	10b	The chapter on the merits of the Dharma teachers is precisely the position of the four faiths in the present and the position after rejoicing. Therefore, it no longer retains the two explanations. Because it has already been explained in the chapter on distinctions and the chapter on rejoicing.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a18_6']	又是稱揚五種法師功用，能入六根同於現在四信之位，〈不輕〉已下既總云法華，豈獨在迹？	又是稱揚五種法師功用，能入六根同於現在四信之位，〈不輕〉已下既總云法華，豈獨在迹？	10b	Moreover, extolling the five kinds of Dharma teachers' functions, one can enter the six sense faculties and be the same as the four kinds of faith in the present. Since the chapter on the Inconceivable Virtues of the Tathagata and below generally refer to the Lotus Sutra, how can it be exclusive to the trace teaching?
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a19_3']	若爾，爾前諸文亦云法華，亦應具二。	若爾，爾前諸文亦云法華，亦應具二。	10b	If so, then the texts before that also refer to the Lotus Sutra, and they should also have both [trace and origin teachings].
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a19_5']	答：	答：	10b	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a19_10']	後未說故。	後未說故。	10b	Because the latter has not yet been expounded.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a20_9']	初世界中文先略釋名，次廣釋，三總結。	初世界中文先略釋名，次廣釋，三總結。	10b	In the first chapter on the world, it first briefly explains the name, then broadly explains it, and thirdly concludes.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a21_6']	以初貫後故先釋名，初文先隨、次喜。	以初貫後故先釋名，初文先隨、次喜。	10b	Because the beginning penetrates the later, it first explains the name. The first text first follows, then rejoices.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a23_8']	初釋隨中事理秖是權實異名，了此權實即非權實故無二無別，即隨順開權顯實之事理也。	初釋隨中事理秖是權實異名，了此權實即非權實故無二無別，即隨順開權顯實之事理也。	10b	First, in explaining following, the principle and phenomena are just different names for provisional and real. Understanding this provisional and real is precisely not provisional and real, so there is no duality and no distinction. This is precisely the principle and phenomena of following the opening of provisional and revealing real.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a25_10']	次廣釋釋喜中言「己人」者，還是迹中事理之力，理有事故故能慶人，事有理故故能自慶。	次廣釋釋喜中言「己人」者，還是迹中事理之力，理有事故故能慶人，事有理故故能自慶。	10b	Next, in broadly explaining rejoicing, it says self and others. This is still the power of principle and phenomena in the trace teaching. Because principle has phenomena, one is able to rejoice for others. Because phenomena have principle, one is able to rejoice for oneself.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a26_12']	又不二而二，故慶己他，二而不二故了非己他。	又不二而二，故慶己他，二而不二故了非己他。	10b	Moreover, not two yet two, therefore rejoicing in oneself and others. Two yet not two, therefore understanding that it is not oneself or others.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a27_11']	次「聞深」下再釋中，亦先釋隨具權實功德。	次「聞深」下再釋中，亦先釋隨具權實功德。	10b	Next, below hearing the profound, it again explains the merit of following the provisional and real virtues.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344a28_11']	次「慶己有智慧」下，又再釋喜具悲智功德。	次「慶己有智慧」下，又再釋喜具悲智功德。	10b	Next, below rejoicing in having wisdom, it again explains the joy of possessing the merit of compassion and wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b02_4']	雖曰慶己正為利他，雖曰慶人正為顯己，故云有智及有慈悲，以自聞經復能教他，故悲智具足方乃名喜。	雖曰慶己正為利他，雖曰慶人正為顯己，故云有智及有慈悲，以自聞經復能教他，故悲智具足方乃名喜。	10b	Although it is said to be rejoicing in oneself, it is mainly for benefiting others. Although it is said to be rejoicing in others, it is mainly for manifesting oneself. Therefore, it is said to have wisdom and compassion, because one can hear the sūtra oneself and also teach others. Therefore, only when compassion and wisdom are complete can it be called joy.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b03_5']	況聞經之始行願俱時，故一句一偈自他俱益。	況聞經之始行願俱時，故一句一偈自他俱益。	10b	Moreover, hearing the sūtra begins with practice and vows occurring simultaneously, so every line and verse benefits both oneself and others.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b04_5']	今此初心專立自行，亦以願力而慶彼耳。	今此初心專立自行，亦以願力而慶彼耳。	10b	Now, this initial mind is exclusively established for one's own practice, and it is also with the power of vows that one rejoices for them.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b04_19']	「權實」下結前兩意共立品名。	「權實」下結前兩意共立品名。	10b	Provisional and real concludes the two previous meanings and establishes the chapter title together.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b07_3']	權實結隨、智斷結喜，慈悲即化他，化他屬解脫，解脫即屬斷，且以自他事理慶喜故屬世界。	權實結隨、智斷結喜，慈悲即化他，化他屬解脫，解脫即屬斷，且以自他事理慶喜故屬世界。	10b	The bonds of expedient and real are followed, and the bonds of wisdom and elimination are delighted in. Compassion is precisely transforming others. Transforming others belongs to liberation. Liberation belongs to elimination. For now, it is rejoicing in the events and principles of self and others, so it belongs to the world.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b08_5']	「又順理」下對治中約本門者，亦先釋、次結品。	「又順理」下對治中約本門者，亦先釋、次結品。	10b	Furthermore, in accordance with principle - in the counteraction, in terms of the original gate, it first explains and then concludes the chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b08_14']	初釋中先隨、次喜。	初釋中先隨、次喜。	10b	In the initial explanation, it first follows and then rejoices.

['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b09_17']	三結成。	三結成。	10b	Third, it concludes.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b10_5']	初文先理、次事。	初文先理、次事。	10b	The initial text first discusses principle and then events.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b12_8']	先理者，若信長遠，信必依理，理與迹中妙理不殊，但指在久本功歸實證，理深時遠故云深遠。	先理者，若信長遠，信必依理，理與迹中妙理不殊，但指在久本功歸實證，理深時遠故云深遠。	10b	First, in terms of principle, if one believes in the distant, one's belief must rely on principle. The principle is no different from the wonderful principle in the traces. It only points to the distant basis, and the merit returns to the true realization. The principle is profound and the time is distant, so it is called profound and distant.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b13_4']	言「信順」者，於理聞久豈敢竊疑？	言「信順」者，於理聞久豈敢竊疑？	10b	As for believing and following, how could one dare to secretly doubt it when hearing about the distant in terms of principle?
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b13_13']	故無一毫疑於久理。	故無一毫疑於久理。	10b	Therefore, there is not a single doubt about the distant principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b16_15']	次「順事」者，秖是如來自從本成利物之相，迹中但有橫論化儀，本中須加久遠竪相，故以化久為竪、化廣為橫，中間節節遍十方故。	次「順事」者，秖是如來自從本成利物之相，迹中但有橫論化儀，本中須加久遠竪相，故以化久為竪、化廣為橫，中間節節遍十方故。	10b	Next, following events means that the Tathagata himself, from his original attainment, has the appearance of benefiting beings. In the traces, there is only a horizontal discussion of the methods of transformation. In the origin, it must be added with the appearance of the distant vertical. Therefore, the long transformation is taken as the vertical, and the vast transformation is taken as the horizontal. In the middle, it is everywhere in the ten directions.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b17_5']	「該亘」秖是橫竪遍耳。	「該亘」秖是橫竪遍耳。	10b	Encompassing simply means the horizontal and vertical pervasiveness.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b20_4']	觀相者，非理無以能化，非化無以顯理，即施迹近事見遠本理，亦是本迹雖殊不思議一，雖一而本迹宛然，故云不二而二。	觀相者，非理無以能化，非化無以顯理，即施迹近事見遠本理，亦是本迹雖殊不思議一，雖一而本迹宛然，故云不二而二。	10b	As for contemplating the appearance, without principle there is no ability to transform. Without transformation, there is no way to manifest the principle. It is the manifestation of the near events of the traces to see the distant principle of the origin. It is also that although the origin and traces are different, they are inconceivably one. Although one, the origin and traces are still distinct. Therefore, it is said that they are non-dual yet dual.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b20_6']	問：	問：	10b	Question:
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b20_14']	別與二同異云何？	別與二同異云何？	10b	How are the distinctions and the two the same and different?
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b20_16', 'ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b22_3']	答：🔽有二，通約本迹、別對多境，以本迹中各有不同之相故也。	答： 有二，通約本迹、別對多境，以本迹中各有不同之相故也。	10b	Answer:🔽There are two. Generally speaking, the origin and traces are different. Specifically, it is in contrast to the many realms. Because there are different appearances in the origin and traces.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b23_11']	次「雖二」下却覆收入，若本若迹皆以三千方顯稱理之妙事也。	次「雖二」下却覆收入，若本若迹皆以三千方顯稱理之妙事也。	10b	Next, below Although two, it is reversed and included. Whether it is the origin or the traces, they are all manifested by the three thousand, which is the wonderful event that accords with principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b25_1']	三「如此」下結者，秖是收束向來事理不二而二等同名一隨。	三「如此」下結者，秖是收束向來事理不二而二等同名一隨。	10b	The third, the conclusion below thus, only collects the previous non-duality of phenomena and principle, and the same name of one following.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b27_14']	「如來」下釋喜，先寄時約人以斥迹權，故四十餘年及七方便，非至今經不會方便無以顯本，望彼不聞故慶我得聞。	「如來」下釋喜，先寄時約人以斥迹權，故四十餘年及七方便，非至今經不會方便無以顯本，望彼不聞故慶我得聞。	10b	The explanation of joy below Tathāgata first uses the time and person to criticize the provisional traces, therefore for more than forty years and the seven expedient means, not reaching the present sūtra, without revealing the provisional means there is no way to manifest the origin, hoping that they did not hear it, therefore rejoicing that I have heard it.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344b28_4']	次「慶我」下正釋喜。	次「慶我」下正釋喜。	10b	Next, below rejoicing I, it correctly explains joy.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c02_2']	三「以凡夫心」下，明喜心相，由聞故知、因知生見，唯佛知佛久遠之壽，唯佛見佛久證實理，聞佛聞顯與佛不殊，入觀行位。	三「以凡夫心」下，明喜心相，由聞故知、因知生見，唯佛知佛久遠之壽，唯佛見佛久證實理，聞佛聞顯與佛不殊，入觀行位。	10b	The third, below with an ordinary person's mind, clarifies the appearance of the joyful mind, because of hearing one knows, due to knowing one gives rise to seeing, only the Buddha knows the Buddha's long-lasting life, only the Buddha sees the Buddha's long-attained true principle, hearing the Buddha's hearing reveals no difference from the Buddha, entering the stage of contemplation and practice.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c02_20']	「如此」下結觀相，亦是橫竪不二意也。	「如此」下結觀相，亦是橫竪不二意也。	10b	The conclusion of the appearance of contemplation below thus is also the meaning of the non-duality of horizontal and vertical.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c03_18']	究竟法界義通橫竪，應云深廣，但是言略。	究竟法界義通橫竪，應云深廣，但是言略。	10b	The ultimate Dharma realm's meaning extends to horizontal and vertical, it should say deep and vast, but it is just a brief statement.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c05_10']	「廣無涯」等者，通歎橫竪，無可與彼、無等同者，故重云「無等等」。	「廣無涯」等者，通歎橫竪，無可與彼、無等同者，故重云「無等等」。	10b	Vast and boundless and so forth praises both horizontally and vertically, there is nothing comparable to it, nothing equal to it, therefore it is said again unequalled.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c06_3']	亦應結云是名為喜，文無者略。	亦應結云是名為喜，文無者略。	10b	It should also be concluded by saying this is called joy, but the text omits it.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c07_2']	「佛今」下結成品名，除事理疑故名對治。	「佛今」下結成品名，除事理疑故名對治。	10b	The Buddha now and below concludes the name of the completed product, because it eliminates doubts about phenomena and principles it is called antidotal.

['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c10_6']	初重牒人相即是牒位，次「初但有」下牒隨，次「但有」下牒喜，三「未有」下雙牒隨喜敘意校量，四「誰聞」下結勸也。	初重牒人相即是牒位，次「初但有」下牒隨，次「但有」下牒喜，三「未有」下雙牒隨喜敘意校量，四「誰聞」下結勸也。	10b	First, it reiterates the characteristics of the person, which is the same as reiterating the stage. Next, at first there is only and below reiterates the following. Next, there is only and below reiterates joy. Third, not yet and below reiterates the following and joy, and arranges the meaning of comparison. Fourth, who hears and below concludes the exhortation.

['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c12_11']	次「所獲」下雙明隨喜功大。	次「所獲」下雙明隨喜功大。	10b	Next, what is obtained and below, it clarifies the great merit of the following and joy.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c13_15']	三「如來」下正引經校量，即舉下文四百萬億，故云巧喻。	三「如來」下正引經校量，即舉下文四百萬億，故云巧喻。	10b	Third, from the Tathāgata is the correct citation of the sutra for comparison, which refers to the four hundred myriads of koṭis in the following text, thus saying skillful metaphor.
['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c15_5']	喻第五十人，是故況云何況最初，此是初品故云何況第五品耶？	喻第五十人，是故況云何況最初，此是初品故云何況第五品耶？	10b	It is a metaphor for the fiftieth person, therefore it is said how much more so for the first person? This is the first chapter, therefore it is said how much more so for the fifth chapter?

['ZH_T34_1719_10b:0344c29_1']	別人知中言「門拙」者，以於地前聞但中名，未即觀故。	別人知中言「門拙」者，以於地前聞但中名，未即觀故。	10b	The separate teaching people know the middle and say the gate is clumsy because before the grounds, they only hear the name of the middle, and have not yet contemplated it.

If one person were to compose a treatise, it would make all the explanations the same. It is not possible to use the small teaching of Abhidharma to explain the Mahayana. Therefore, we know that the treatise itself explains the Vaipulya sutras. The reason why Kasyapa lamented the ruined seeds is that at the assembly of the Lotus Sutra, the ruined seeds sprouted again. Vasubandhu then used the treatise to explain it.

Therefore, the conditions and understanding are said to originally exist as seeds. It still uses nature virtue to clarify the two causes, because it is opposed to the newly perfumed cultivation and attainment. These three are the cause, and the turning cause results in the effect.

But when abiding in the cause, the nature of the effect is called the cause, and when in the effect, it embraces the cause and is called the effect. Although the names may be mutually obtained, the principle is always thus.

The non-slighting only proclaims twenty-four characters, with a thesis and an explanation, fully describing cause and effect. Since the cause is the three natures, the effect is the three virtues. Moreover, using the four ones to benefit oneself and others, it directly points to the two causes as the teaching proclaimed by the non-slighting. Therefore, it is said to be vast purport.

How can it be said to be merely becoming a buddha? Therefore, all must be explained in terms of the two teachings, only then does it match what Light-Keeper proclaimed, and it accords with what Sound of Thunder proclaimed.

Seeing that the principle of sentient beings' nature is equal to the principle of fruition, therefore paying homage to the nature and paying homage to the Buddha, their source is no different. This is their own practice.

How could this not be encouraging us to cultivate perfect causes? This refers to those who are in accord with the present, who also have faith and practice, and who also practice the Dharma.

Far means that although Shengyi did not accept it in the present, he received it in his mind. Due to the fault of slandering and scolding, he fell into the evil paths. By the power of hearing and being in accord, he encountered Buqing again, and even to this day he was made to enter the assembly. For this reason, even the arrogant still formed distant causes. How could hearing and believing not have present benefits?
