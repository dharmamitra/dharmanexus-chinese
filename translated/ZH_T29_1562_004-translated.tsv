Therefore, now they will be discussed in terms of the eighteen elements. Through this, the meanings of the aggregates and sense bases will be accomplished.

['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b05_17']	所緣有對，謂心心所於自所緣和會被礙，得有對名。	所緣有對，謂心心所於自所緣和會被礙，得有對名。	004	Obstruction as object refers to mind and mental activities that are obstructed and hindered by their own objects and for that reason are called obstructed.
['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b06_8']	境界、所緣復有何別？	境界、所緣復有何別？	004	What is the difference between domain and object?
['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b07_6']	若於彼法，此有功能，即說彼為此法境界。	若於彼法，此有功能，即說彼為此法境界。	004	If something has the power with regard to a dharma, it is said to be the domain of that dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b08_5']	如人於彼有勝功能，便說彼為我之境界。	如人於彼有勝功能，便說彼為我之境界。	004	For example, if a person has superior power with regard to another, the latter is called his domain.
['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b09_4']	心心所法執彼而起，彼於心等名為所緣。	心心所法執彼而起，彼於心等名為所緣。	004	Mind and mental activities grasp and arise with regard to objects, and objects are therefore called their objects.

['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b13_13']	越彼於餘此不轉故。	越彼於餘此不轉故。	004	Because they do not evolve with regard to other objects beyond those.

['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b17_10']	障礙有對謂可集色，自於他處被礙不生，如手石等更相障礙。	障礙有對謂可集色，自於他處被礙不生，如手石等更相障礙。	004	Resistance as obstruction refers to the aggregation of form, because it is obstructed by itself and other places and is not born, like hands and stones that obstruct each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b18_18']	今於如是三有對中唯辯障礙，故但言十，更相障礙對義勝故。	今於如是三有對中唯辯障礙，故但言十，更相障礙對義勝故。	004	Now, among these three kinds of resistance, we are discussing only obstruction, and therefore we speak only of ten dharmas. The meaning of resistance as mutual obstruction is superior.

['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b23_3']	說十有色名為有對，義准說餘名為無對。	說十有色名為有對，義准說餘名為無對。	004	It is said that the ten with form are called resistant, and by implication the rest are called non-resistant.
['ZH_T29_1562_004:0348b23_18']	言有色者，謂除無表，餘色蘊攝。	言有色者，謂除無表，餘色蘊攝。	004	As for those with form, it means excluding the formless, which is included in the aggregate of form.
