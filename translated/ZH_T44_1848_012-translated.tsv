['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359a27_13']	以真心隨熏全體成動而作諸法。	以真心隨熏全體成動而作諸法。	012	Because the true mind, in accordance with perfuming, completely transforms the entire body into movement and creates all phenomena.
['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359a28_6']	如金生器等故云生也。	如金生器等故云生也。	012	It is like gold producing vessels, and so it is called arising.

['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b02_13']	故疏云。	故疏云。	012	Therefore, the commentary says:
['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b03_3']	心源還淨故云滅也。	心源還淨故云滅也。	012	The source of the mind returns to purity, and thus it is called cessation.
['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b03_12']	此約真心顯生滅義。	此約真心顯生滅義。	012	This, based on the true mind, reveals the meaning of arising and ceasing.

['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b08_1']	皆妄有生滅。	皆妄有生滅。	012	they are all falsely arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b08_7']	真無生滅也。	真無生滅也。	012	The true has neither arising nor ceasing.
['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b09_3']	既心下。	既心下。	012	Having already discussed the mind,

['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b12_14']	當知無明能生一切染法。	當知無明能生一切染法。	012	One should know that ignorance can give rise to all defiled dharmas.
['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b13_7']	以一切染法皆是不覺相故。	以一切染法皆是不覺相故。	012	Because all defiled dharmas are the characteristics of non-enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_012:0359b13_12']	今文復云。	今文復云。	012	The present text further says:
