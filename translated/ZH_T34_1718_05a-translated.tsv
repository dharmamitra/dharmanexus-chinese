The two vehicles benefit themselves with the middling and lower, and their kindness does not reach others. Bodhisattvas drive oxen to transport others out of the fire, and are therefore called mahāsattvas. This is the parable in the Tripiṭaka Teaching.

They can only partially and not completely eliminate the common delusions. They are not pāramitās. The bodhisattvas give rise to the mind of enlightenment for a long time, the principle is deep, the wisdom is strong, and they eliminate the specific delusions, exhausting the source and exhausting the nature.

Hearing this Dharma sound, relying on the Buddha's mouth to hear and rejoice, so it is called oral joy. Attaining what has never been attained before, this is my understanding of the Buddha's intention, so it is called mental joy. This is the chapter heading.

In the past, when the Buddha was a bodhisattva, he received predictions, but I was not included in this matter. Seeing the Buddha was distant. Since I did not see the Buddha, there was no bodily joy.
['ZH_T34_1718_05a:0064b16_2']	「聞如是法」者，若日照高山時，密有聞義，顯如聾如啞，不得道聞如是法也，秖是方等教中聞大乘實慧與今不殊，故言聞如是法也。	「聞如是法」者，若日照高山時，密有聞義，顯如聾如啞，不得道聞如是法也，秖是方等教中聞大乘實慧與今不殊，故言聞如是法也。	Hearing such a Dharma means that when the sun shines on high mountains, there is secretly the meaning of hearing, but it is as if deaf or mute. One who has not attained the Way does not hear such a Dharma. It is just the real wisdom of the Mahayana that one hears in the Vaipulya teachings, which is no different from the present, so it is called hearing such a Dharma.

Since the body is in the mountains and forests, and the mind clings to the lesser vehicle, then one does not hear the Dharma, so there is no joy in the mouth.

They doubt the three teachings, which are the means to enter, based on the one principle that is entered. Since the one principle is the same, they have lost the insight of the Buddha. Since the three teachings are different, the bodhisattvas receive the prediction. Receiving the prediction means that the Tathāgata has partiality, which becomes a mistake. Now, recounting this mistake, it says repenting.

The reason is that without waiting for the explanation of the causes, there is no true understanding. Also, because of not recognizing skillful means, there is no provisional understanding. Because of lacking understanding, there is no joy in the mind. The past mistakes having been revealed, the present attainment becomes self-evident.
['ZH_T34_1718_05a:0064c03_8']	不待說所因者，自責不解實也；	不待說所因者，自責不解實也；	Not waiting for the explanation of the causes means blaming oneself for not understanding the real.

The initial illumination of the high mountain clarifies the wisdom of the three truths, which is the cause of attaining Buddhahood. Using this to oppose me, I do not accept it, losing it in the past;

Although one has not yet realized the truth, one is wearing the Tathāgata's robe and is called the forbearance of cessation. The three truths contain all merits. The wisdom of right contemplation subdues attachment and views. The middle way illuminates both the provisional and the real. One who has accumulated good roots for a long time can cultivate this contemplation. This contemplation surpasses the seven expedient means. This contemplation contemplates the nature of the mind and is called the supreme concentration. Then the three karmas are without fault. When encountering conditions and facing objects, one's deportment is without error. One who can contemplate in this way has the characteristics of deep faith and understanding, and all Buddhas rejoice.
