The able transformation is the response, and the spiritual powers and preaching of the Dharma. The transformed is the inspiration, and the retinue and benefits. These ten are the names that can be interpreted in the teaching of one generation. The meaning of the great part is to reveal that all the names are wonderful.

The three thousand worlds are all empty, provisional, and middle. This is the great body of this sutra, the wonderful opening, the realm, and the story and principle are both fused. Because wisdom arises from this, it is without conditions. Because practice arises from this, it is without action. Because the stages go through this, they are mutually inclusive. Because the three dharmas are completely exhausted in this, the fruition is fulfilled. Because beings possess this, a single thought can evoke a response. Because the Buddha attains this, he responds without scheming. Because the spiritual powers use this, the transformations are endless. Because the teaching of the Dharma relies on this, the bestowal and revelation are sovereign. Because the retinue is completely this, the natural affinity is close. Because the benefits accord with this, not a single one does not become a Buddha.

One should know that the ten approaches of the Mohezhiguan are discussed separately, but each approach is not apart from the three thousand realms, which are empty, provisional, and the middle. Therefore, it is said that the great principle of contemplation is the Dharma.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a07_17']	《義例》云：	《義例》云：	001	The Yilei says:
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a10_2']	「散引諸文該乎一代，文體正意唯歸二經，一依《法華》本迹顯實，二依《涅槃》扶律顯常，以此二經同醍醐故。	「散引諸文該乎一代，文體正意唯歸二經，一依《法華》本迹顯實，二依《涅槃》扶律顯常，以此二經同醍醐故。	001	The various scriptures are scattered throughout the teachings of the Buddha, but the main purpose of the text is to return to the two sutras. The first is the Lotus Sutra, which reveals the ultimate truth through the teachings of the original and the traces. The second is the Nirvana Sutra, which supports the precepts and reveals the eternal. This is because these two sutras are both like the finest cream.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a11_7']	」是知用此十妙絕待之義為觀體者，方譬日光不與暗共。	」是知用此十妙絕待之義為觀體者，方譬日光不與暗共。	001	Therefore, one should know that using the absolute meaning of the ten mysteries as the principle of contemplation is like the sunlight that does not coexist with darkness.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a13_10']	又此三千法門遍於諸法，若色若心、依之與正、眾生諸佛、剎剎塵塵無不具足，故《華嚴》云：	又此三千法門遍於諸法，若色若心、依之與正、眾生諸佛、剎剎塵塵無不具足，故《華嚴》云：	001	Moreover, this Dharma gate of the three thousand realms is found in all dharmas, whether form or mind, the dependent or the principal, sentient beings or buddhas, lands or particles of dust, all of which are complete. Therefore, the Huayan Sutra says:
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a14_11']	「如心佛亦爾，如佛眾生然，心佛及眾生，是三無差別。	「如心佛亦爾，如佛眾生然，心佛及眾生，是三無差別。	001	Just as the mind, so is the Buddha; just as the Buddha, so are sentient beings. The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings - these three are no different.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a15_18']	」故今家釋經題法字，約此三法各具三千互具互融方名妙法。	」故今家釋經題法字，約此三法各具三千互具互融方名妙法。	001	Therefore, the present commentary on the word dharma in the title of the sutra is based on these three dharmas, each possessing the three thousand realms, mutually inclusive and mutually interpenetrating, which is then called the wonderful Dharma.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a19_1']	然雖諸法彼彼各具，若為觀體必須的指心法三千，故玄文云，佛法太高，眾生法太廣，於初心為難，心佛及眾生，是三無差別，觀心則易。	然雖諸法彼彼各具，若為觀體必須的指心法三千，故玄文云，佛法太高，眾生法太廣，於初心為難，心佛及眾生，是三無差別，觀心則易。	001	Although all dharmas possess each other, if it is to be the essence of contemplation, it must specifically point to the mind dharma and the three thousand realms. Therefore, the Profound Text says, The Buddha Dharma is too lofty, and the sentient beings' Dharma is too vast. For beginners, it is difficult.

If it were not so, why would each section only discuss the mind? How could the dust, lands, birth, and Buddhas not be complete?

['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a26_12']	迹因具明境智行位四者，離因故迹；	迹因具明境智行位四者，離因故迹；	001	The traces of the causes are fully explained in the four of realm, wisdom, practice, and stages, because the causes are separated.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a27_7']	果惟明三法一妙者，合果故本。	果惟明三法一妙者，合果故本。	001	The result only clarifies the three dharmas and one wondrousness, because the result is combined.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a28_5']	中不云境等，唯明一本因妙者，合因故；	中不云境等，唯明一本因妙者，合因故；	001	In the middle, it does not say realm, etc., and only clarifies the one original wondrousness of the cause, because the cause is combined.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706a29_7']	本果之外，更立本國土、本涅槃、本壽命者，離果故。	本果之外，更立本國土、本涅槃、本壽命者，離果故。	001	Outside of the original result, it further establishes the original land, original nirvana, and original lifespan, because the result is separated.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b02_3']	故知唯云因妙必具境等，唯云三法必具國土等，若知因果不殊，自他豈應有異？	故知唯云因妙必具境等，唯云三法必具國土等，若知因果不殊，自他豈應有異？	001	Therefore, know that only saying the wondrousness of the cause must include the realm, etc., and only saying the three dharmas must include the land, etc. If one knows that the cause and result are not different, how could one's own and others' be different?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b03_11']	以本初坐道場時亦遍赴物，豈不現通說法，豈無眷屬獲益邪？	以本初坐道場時亦遍赴物，豈不現通說法，豈無眷屬獲益邪？	001	Because when the original one first sat in the place of enlightenment, he also went everywhere to respond to beings. How could he not manifest spiritual powers and expound the Dharma? How could he not have retinue who gained benefits?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b04_18']	應知久近雖異，皆以三千俱空假中而為大綱，故云不思議一。	應知久近雖異，皆以三千俱空假中而為大綱，故云不思議一。	001	One should know that although the near and distant are different, they all take the three thousand as emptiness, conventionality, and the Middle as the main framework, hence it is said to be the inconceivable one.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b05_9']	二、況體下，例四章。	二、況體下，例四章。	001	Second, from Furthermore, the essence below, it gives examples of the four chapters.

The general and specific are called the ten kinds of wonderful realms, which are the essence, wisdom, practice, stages, and Dharma are the main point, and the three kinds of wonderful responses and so forth are the function. Since the moved and retinue have obtained benefits, they must combine from the cause to the effect and give rise to the function of benefiting others, which also has the essence and so forth. Therefore, it is said that it is only because of the Dharma of self, other, cause, and effect.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b11_12']	又名等四章皆是被下之法，即屬教也，而須以相別其麁妙。	又名等四章皆是被下之法，即屬教也，而須以相別其麁妙。	001	Moreover, the four chapters such as name and so forth are all the Dharma that is explained below, which belongs to the teaching, and it is necessary to use characteristics to distinguish their coarseness and subtlety.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b13_15']	今之四章，出前三教四時之上，復能開前令皆圓妙，故永異之言含其待絕，以唯今經能遍開故。	今之四章，出前三教四時之上，復能開前令皆圓妙，故永異之言含其待絕，以唯今經能遍開故。	001	The four chapters now expounded come from above the four teachings and four periods of the past, and are able to open up the past, making them all perfect and wonderful, therefore they are eternally different. The words containing its dependence and transcendence are because only the present sutra can universally open them up.

['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b14_19']	初、指妙歸心。	初、指妙歸心。	001	First, pointing to the wondrous and returning to the mind.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b17_16']	三千妙體為教所歸，故一期之內五味傳傳相生故縱，四教各各趣理故橫，而所詮法雖有顯覆，準今經意，未嘗暫離三千妙法。	三千妙體為教所歸，故一期之內五味傳傳相生故縱，四教各各趣理故橫，而所詮法雖有顯覆，準今經意，未嘗暫離三千妙法。	001	The wondrous essence of the three thousand is where the teachings return. Therefore, within one period, the five flavors are transmitted to each other, hence the longitudinal. The four teachings each lead to principle, hence the horizontal. However, although the expounded Dharma has revealed and concealed, according to the meaning of the present sutra, it has never been apart from the wondrous Dharma of the three thousand for a moment.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b19_12']	又雖諸法皆具三千，今為易成妙解妙觀故，的指一念即三法，妙中特取心法也。	又雖諸法皆具三千，今為易成妙解妙觀故，的指一念即三法，妙中特取心法也。	001	Moreover, although all dharmas are endowed with the three thousand, in order to easily accomplish wondrous understanding and wondrous contemplation, it specifically points to a single thought, which is the three dharmas. Among the wondrous, it specifically takes the dharma of the mind.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b21_19']	應知心法就迷就事而辨，故《釋籤》云，眾生法，一往通因果，二往唯局因，佛法定在果，心法定在因。	應知心法就迷就事而辨，故《釋籤》云，眾生法，一往通因果，二往唯局因，佛法定在果，心法定在因。	001	You should know that mental factors are distinguished based on delusion and phenomena. Therefore, the Shijiao lun says, The dharma of sentient beings generally includes causes and effects, but specifically only refers to causes. The dharma of buddhas definitely belongs to the effect. The dharma of mind definitely belongs to the cause.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b22_16']	若約迷悟分之，佛唯屬悟，二皆在迷。	若約迷悟分之，佛唯屬悟，二皆在迷。	001	If we divide it based on delusion and enlightenment, buddhas only belong to enlightenment, while the other two are both in delusion.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b24_1']	復就迷中眾生屬他，通一切故，心法屬己，別指自心故。	復就迷中眾生屬他，通一切故，心法屬己，別指自心故。	001	Furthermore, within delusion, sentient beings belong to others because they include everything. Mental factors belong to oneself because they specifically point to one's own mind.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b26_10']	四念處節節皆云觀一念無明心，止觀初觀陰入心九境，亦約事中明心，故云煩惱心、病心乃至禪見心等。	四念處節節皆云觀一念無明心，止觀初觀陰入心九境，亦約事中明心，故云煩惱心、病心乃至禪見心等。	001	In each section of the four establishments of mindfulness, it says to contemplate a moment of ignorant mind. In the beginning of the Śhīxiǎnpíng, contemplating the aggregates and sense bases, and the mind of the nine realms, it also discusses the mind in terms of phenomena, saying the mind of afflictions, the mind of illness, up to the mind of meditation and views.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b27_12']	及隨自意中四運心等，豈非就迷就事辨所觀心。	及隨自意中四運心等，豈非就迷就事辨所觀心。	001	And in the following one's own mind section, the mind of the four activities, how could this not be distinguishing the contemplated mind based on delusion and phenomena?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b28_10']	有人解今一念云是真性，恐未稱文旨。	有人解今一念云是真性，恐未稱文旨。	001	Some people explain the present moment as true nature, but I'm afraid it doesn't match the meaning of the text.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b28_13']	何者？	何者？	001	Why is that?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706b29_7']	若論真性，諸法皆是，何獨一念！	若論真性，諸法皆是，何獨一念！	001	If discussing true nature, all dharmas are it, how can it be only a single moment?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706c01_6']	又諸文多云觀於己心，豈可真理有於己他？	又諸文多云觀於己心，豈可真理有於己他？	001	Moreover, many texts say to contemplate one's own mind. How can the true principle have self and other?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706c04_8']	更有人全不許立陰、界、入等為所觀境，唯云不思議境，此之二師灼然違教，唯《摩訶止觀》先於六章廣示妙解，豈不論諸法本真皆不思議？	更有人全不許立陰、界、入等為所觀境，唯云不思議境，此之二師灼然違教，唯《摩訶止觀》先於六章廣示妙解，豈不論諸法本真皆不思議？	001	There are also people who do not allow the aggregates, realms, and sense bases to be established as the observed objects, only saying that the inconceivable realm. These two teachers clearly contradict the teachings. Only the Mahāyāna Calming and Contemplation first extensively demonstrates the wondrous understanding in the six chapters. How could it not discuss all dharmas being originally true and inconceivable?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706c08_9']	然欲立行造修，須揀入理之門、起觀之處，故於三科揀却界、入復於五陰，又除前四的取識陰，《輔行》又揀能招報心，及以發得屬於下境，此是去丈就尺，去尺就寸，如炙得穴也。	然欲立行造修，須揀入理之門、起觀之處，故於三科揀却界、入復於五陰，又除前四的取識陰，《輔行》又揀能招報心，及以發得屬於下境，此是去丈就尺，去尺就寸，如炙得穴也。	001	However, wanting to establish practice and cultivation, one must select the gateway to enter the principle and the place to give rise to contemplation. Therefore, among the three categories, the realms are eliminated. Within the five aggregates, the first four are also eliminated, and the aggregate of consciousness is specifically taken. The Supplementary Practice also eliminates the mind that can attract retribution and what is attained through development, which belong to the lower realm. This is like going from a zhang to a chi, going from a chi to a cun, like finding the acupuncture point for moxibustion.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706c11_8']	乃依此心觀不思議，顯三千法乃至貪瞋等心，及諸根塵，皆云觀陰、入、界及下九境，文中揀判毫末不差，豈是直云真性及不思議？	乃依此心觀不思議，顯三千法乃至貪瞋等心，及諸根塵，皆云觀陰、入、界及下九境，文中揀判毫末不差，豈是直云真性及不思議？	001	Therefore, based on this mind, the inconceivable is contemplated, revealing the three thousand dharmas, up to the mind of greed, anger, etc., and all faculties and objects, all of which are said to contemplate the aggregates, sense bases, and elements, as well as the nine objects below. The distinctions in the text are not the slightest bit off. How can it simply be said to be the true nature and the inconceivable?

How could one not read the text that divides the sections in the Supplementary Practice? First, it clarifies the realm, which is the text that goes from the foot to the inch. Next, it clarifies the cultivation of contemplation, which is the text of the ten contemplations such as contemplating the inconceivable realm.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706c18_8']	況《輔行》委示二境之相非不分明，豈得直以一念名真理及不思議邪！	況《輔行》委示二境之相非不分明，豈得直以一念名真理及不思議邪！	001	How much more so is the explanation in the Supplementary Explanations of the characteristics of the two objects not clear? How can one simply take the one thought as the true principle and the inconceivable?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706c20_12']	應知不思議境對觀智邊不分而分名所觀境，若對所破陰等諸境，故不思議境之與觀皆名能觀。	應知不思議境對觀智邊不分而分名所觀境，若對所破陰等諸境，故不思議境之與觀皆名能觀。	001	One should know that the inconceivable object, in relation to the observing wisdom, is divided without being divided and is called the observed object. If it is in relation to the objects to be destroyed, such as the aggregates, then both the inconceivable object and the observation are called the observer.
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0706c20_19']	故《止觀》云：	故《止觀》云：	001	Therefore, the Mohe Zhiguan says:

The first person has dull weapons, weak physical strength, and little wisdom and strategy. He first breaks through two layers, then reorganizes his troops and equipment to break through the third layer. Therefore, he circles around for days and months.

Now, using a strong body to illustrate the three truths of the perfect teaching, sharp weapons to illustrate the three cessations of the perfect teaching, and many strategies to illustrate the three contemplations of the perfect teaching, the weapons and other things are all based on physical strength.

Just as afflictions are identical to enlightenment and birth and death are identical to nirvana. The Profound Text briefly lists the ten practices, all established based on this.

Therefore, the Yi Le explains this text, saying: If the essence is understood and the practice of contemplation arises or confronts the aggregates and sense fields, it does not go beyond the Dharma realm and becomes inconceivable.

['ZH_T46_1928_001:0707b04_18']	諸家不明性惡，遂須翻惡為善、斷惡證善，故極頓者仍云本無惡元是善，既不能全惡是惡，故皆即義不成。	諸家不明性惡，遂須翻惡為善、斷惡證善，故極頓者仍云本無惡元是善，既不能全惡是惡，故皆即義不成。	001	Various schools do not understand inherent evil, so they must turn evil into good and eliminate evil to realize good. Therefore, even the most sudden teaching still says that originally there is no evil and it is all good. Since they cannot completely take evil as evil, the meaning of identity is not established in all cases.

Since it is about enlightenment based on identity, there is nothing to be overturned. Afflictions and birth and death are the nine realms. Since the Dharma of the ten realms mutually includes each other, it is called perfect. How can the Buddha destroy the nine and turn the nine?
['ZH_T46_1928_001:0707b20_1']	如是方名達於非道，魔界即佛。	如是方名達於非道，魔界即佛。	001	Only in this way can it be called penetrating the non-way, and the realm of demons is precisely the Buddha.

Therefore, they only obtain the name of identity but not the meaning of identity.

If one can understand this, one can freely take or abandon it. Therefore, the Mohe Zhiguan also says, Only believe in the nature of dharmas, do not believe in the various. The words seem to discard delusion and contemplate the origin, but how is it different from the teachings of the ancients?

Therefore, it is required to cultivate cessation and contemplation using the ten dharmas to perfect the vehicle, only then can one personally contemplate the subtle realms, arouse wisdom, establish practices, traverse the stages, and attain the fruits. Therefore, the ten vehicles can enable practitioners to accomplish their own causes and effects.

This text on unraveling the net discusses the arising in a general way, although it is after the fruition and transforming others, if one carefully examines its meaning, it often clarifies the initial mind's own practice. Therefore, the text says, Various sūtras and treatises open people's eyes. Grasping this and doubting that, one is right and others are wrong. Now, harmonizing the sūtras and treatises, untie the knots and emerge from the cage. Isn't this the beginner's ability to unravel others' nets!

The Buddha Dharma of the Ganges sands is understood in a single thought. Isn't this the arising of teachings for one's own practice?

Therefore, it says, Sticky hands are easily attached, and incoherent dreams are hard to wake up from. Sealing the text and equating it with the meaning, one considers oneself to be correct.
