['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247a23_2']	9 釋學果寂滅勝相品釋學果寂滅勝相第九論曰：	9 釋學果寂滅勝相品釋學果寂滅勝相第九論曰：	013	Commentary on the Chapter on the Supreme Characteristics of the Cessation of Learning, Explaining the Supreme Characteristics of the Cessation of Learning, Chapter 9. The treatise states:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247a24_3']	如此已說依慧學差別，云何應知寂滅差別？	如此已說依慧學差別，云何應知寂滅差別？	013	Thus, the distinctions based on the learning of wisdom have been explained. How should one understand the distinctions in cessation?
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247a24_6']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary states:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247a26_3']	菩薩道與二乘道既有差別，由道得滅，菩薩滅與二乘滅亦應有差別，云何可知？	菩薩道與二乘道既有差別，由道得滅，菩薩滅與二乘滅亦應有差別，云何可知？	013	Since the bodhisattva path and the path of the two vehicles have distinctions, the cessation attained through the path, the bodhisattva's cessation, and the cessation of the two vehicles should also have distinctions. How can this be known?
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247a27_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise states:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247a27_16']	諸菩薩惑滅，即是無住處涅槃。	諸菩薩惑滅，即是無住處涅槃。	013	The bodhisattvas' cessation of afflictions is the nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247a27_19']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary states:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b01_7']	二乘與菩薩同以惑滅為滅諦，二乘惑滅一向背生死趣涅槃，菩薩惑滅不背生死不背涅槃，故異二乘。	二乘與菩薩同以惑滅為滅諦，二乘惑滅一向背生死趣涅槃，菩薩惑滅不背生死不背涅槃，故異二乘。	013	The two vehicles and bodhisattvas are the same in taking the cessation of afflictions as the truth of cessation. The cessation of afflictions of the two vehicles completely turns away from saṃsāra and heads towards nirvāṇa, while the cessation of afflictions of bodhisattvas does not turn away from saṃsāra and does not turn away from nirvāṇa, thus differing from the two vehicles.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b03_6']	菩薩此滅，於四種涅槃中是無住處，一本來清淨涅槃、二無住處涅槃、三有餘、四無餘。	菩薩此滅，於四種涅槃中是無住處，一本來清淨涅槃、二無住處涅槃、三有餘、四無餘。	013	This cessation of the bodhisattva, among the four kinds of nirvāṇa, is the abode of non-abiding, namely, the originally pure nirvāṇa, the nirvāṇa of no abiding, the nirvāṇa with remainder, and the nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b06_13']	菩薩不見生死涅槃異，由般若不住生死、由慈悲不住涅槃，若分別生死則住生死，若分別涅槃則住涅槃，菩薩得無分別智，無所分別，故無所住。	菩薩不見生死涅槃異，由般若不住生死、由慈悲不住涅槃，若分別生死則住生死，若分別涅槃則住涅槃，菩薩得無分別智，無所分別，故無所住。	013	The bodhisattva does not see the difference between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Due to prajñā, he does not abide in saṃsāra. Due to compassion, he does not abide in nirvāṇa. If one discriminates saṃsāra, then one abides in saṃsāra. If one discriminates nirvāṇa, then one abides in nirvāṇa. The bodhisattva attains the wisdom of non-discrimination and has nothing to discriminate, therefore he has no abode.

['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b08_2']	無住處涅槃以何法為相？	無住處涅槃以何法為相？	013	What are the characteristics of the nirvāṇa of no abiding?
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b09_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise states:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b10_2']	捨離惑與不捨離生死，二所依死，轉依為相。	捨離惑與不捨離生死，二所依死，轉依為相。	013	Its characteristics are the transformation of the basis, which is both the abandonment of afflictions and the non-abandonment of saṃsāra.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b10_5']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary states:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b11_7']	若菩薩在轉依位，不與諸惑緣起處，故名捨離。	若菩薩在轉依位，不與諸惑緣起處，故名捨離。	013	When the bodhisattva is in the stage of transformation of the basis, he is not the basis for the arising of afflictions, and is therefore said to have abandoned them.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b12_6']	惑在出觀位，必起分別故，名不捨離生死。	惑在出觀位，必起分別故，名不捨離生死。	013	Because delusions arise necessarily in the state of emerging from concentration, they are called not abandoning birth and death.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b13_5']	若偏觀前後明此二義，亦得一時具二義；	若偏觀前後明此二義，亦得一時具二義；	013	If one contemplates only one of the two aspects, it is clear that these two meanings can be present at the same time.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b14_8']	若雙觀二義，必在一時，此二義並以依他性為依止。	若雙觀二義，必在一時，此二義並以依他性為依止。	013	If one contemplates both aspects, they must be present at the same time. Both of these two meanings are based on the dependent nature.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b15_18']	無住處涅槃以轉依為相，即轉二著，凡夫著生死、二乘著涅槃。	無住處涅槃以轉依為相，即轉二著，凡夫著生死、二乘著涅槃。	013	The nirvāṇa with no fixed abode has the characteristic of transformation, which transforms the two attachments: ordinary beings are attached to birth and death, and the two vehicles are attached to nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b18_14']	菩薩得無分別智，不見生死涅槃有差別，雖滅惑不住涅槃，雖起分別不住生死，故此涅槃以轉依為相，此轉依即依止依他性。	菩薩得無分別智，不見生死涅槃有差別，雖滅惑不住涅槃，雖起分別不住生死，故此涅槃以轉依為相，此轉依即依止依他性。	013	Bodhisattvas attain non-discriminating cognition and do not see any difference between birth and death and nirvāṇa. Although they extinguish afflictions, they do not abide in nirvāṇa. Although they give rise to discrimination, they do not abide in birth and death. Therefore, this nirvāṇa has the characteristic of transformation. This transformation is based on the dependent nature.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b19_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b20_12']	此中生死是依他性不淨品一分為體，涅槃是依他性淨品一分為體。	此中生死是依他性不淨品一分為體，涅槃是依他性淨品一分為體。	013	Herein, birth and death takes the impure part of the dependent nature as its essence, and nirvāṇa takes the pure part of the dependent nature as its essence.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b20_15']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b21_5']	此釋二所依止義。	此釋二所依止義。	013	This explains the meaning of the two bases.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b22_14']	本識名依他性，本識若起分別，即是不淨品，說此一分為生死體。	本識名依他性，本識若起分別，即是不淨品，說此一分為生死體。	013	The fundamental consciousness is called the nature of dependent arising. If the fundamental consciousness gives rise to discrimination, it is then the impure class, and a part of this is said to be the essence of samsara.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b24_10']	如分別依他性，此性不如此有，此分別無所有即是淨品，依此一分為涅槃體。	如分別依他性，此性不如此有，此分別無所有即是淨品，依此一分為涅槃體。	013	As discrimination is the nature of dependent arising, this nature does not exist in this way. This discrimination being non-existent is the pure class, and a part of this is taken as the essence of nirvana.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b25_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b25_18']	本依者，是具淨不淨品二分依他性。	本依者，是具淨不淨品二分依他性。	013	The fundamental basis refers to the nature of dependent arising that possesses both the pure and impure classes.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b26_2']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b28_2']	分別性是生死，真實性是涅槃，從本以來此二品以依他性為依止，即說依他性為本依。	分別性是生死，真實性是涅槃，從本以來此二品以依他性為依止，即說依他性為本依。	013	The nature of discrimination is samsara, and the nature of reality is nirvana. From the beginning, these two classes take the nature of dependent arising as their basis, and so the nature of dependent arising is called the fundamental basis.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247b29_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c01_14']	轉依者，對治起時，此依他性由不淨品分永改本性，由淨品分永成本性。	轉依者，對治起時，此依他性由不淨品分永改本性，由淨品分永成本性。	013	The transformation of the basis refers to when the antidote arises, this nature of dependent arising permanently transforms its original nature due to the impure class, and permanently establishes its original nature due to the pure class.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c01_17']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c02_6']	轉依亦屬依他性。	轉依亦屬依他性。	013	The transformation of the basis also belongs to the nature of dependent arising.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c04_3']	三乘道是對治，此依他性道未起時如見諦等，或能起諸業感惡道報，名不淨品。	三乘道是對治，此依他性道未起時如見諦等，或能起諸業感惡道報，名不淨品。	013	The path of the three vehicles is the antidote. Before this dependent nature path arises, it is like seeing the truth, etc., or it can give rise to various actions that lead to the retribution of evil destinies, which is called the impure category.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c05_6']	道起已後，如此不淨品滅不更生，故言永改本性。	道起已後，如此不淨品滅不更生，故言永改本性。	013	After the path arises, this impure category ceases and does not arise again, so it is said to permanently change the original nature.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c06_17']	此依他性道及道果名淨品，道即戒定慧，道果有二種，謂有為無為。	此依他性道及道果名淨品，道即戒定慧，道果有二種，謂有為無為。	013	This dependent nature path and the path's fruit are called the pure category. The path is precepts, concentration, and wisdom. The path's fruit is of two kinds: conditioned and unconditioned.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c08_2']	有為即解脫、解脫知見，無為即本惑滅及未來惑不生。	有為即解脫、解脫知見，無為即本惑滅及未來惑不生。	013	The conditioned is liberation and the knowledge and insight of liberation. The unconditioned is the extinction of original afflictions and the non-arising of future afflictions.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c09_3']	道未起時，戒等淨品未成立，但有本性清淨。	道未起時，戒等淨品未成立，但有本性清淨。	013	Before the path arises, the precepts and other pure categories are not yet established, but there is only the originally pure nature.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c11_3']	由道起故，與五分法身及無垢清淨相應，如此相應乃至得佛無有變異，故言永成本性。	由道起故，與五分法身及無垢清淨相應，如此相應乃至得佛無有變異，故言永成本性。	013	Because the path arises, it is associated with the five parts of the Dharma body and the pure nature without defilements. This association lasts until one attains Buddhahood without change, so it is said to permanently establish the original nature.

['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c12_14']	此轉依若略說，有六種轉。	此轉依若略說，有六種轉。	013	In brief, this transformation of the basis has six kinds of transformations.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c12_17']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary says:🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c14_6']	若約三乘道及道果，廣說則有多轉依義，今略說故但有六種。	若約三乘道及道果，廣說則有多轉依義，今略說故但有六種。	013	If we discuss the three vehicles' path and the fruits of the path, there are many meanings of transformation. Now, because we are speaking briefly, there are only six kinds.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c15_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c16_2']	一益力損能轉，由隨信樂位，住聞熏習力故。	一益力損能轉，由隨信樂位，住聞熏習力故。	013	The first is the transformation of increasing power and diminishing ability, which occurs in the stage of faith and joy due to the power of hearing and cultivation.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c16_5']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c17_11']	由三乘聖道起阿黎耶識中，聞熏習功能更增，說名益力。	由三乘聖道起阿黎耶識中，聞熏習功能更增，說名益力。	013	Because the holy paths of the three vehicles arise, the power of hearing and cultivation in the ālaya consciousness increases even more, which is called increasing power.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c19_1']	於阿黎耶識中所有諸惑熏習，由對治起故無復本用，說名損能。	於阿黎耶識中所有諸惑熏習，由對治起故無復本用，說名損能。	013	The habitual tendencies of all afflictions in the ālaya consciousness, because the antidotes arise, no longer have their original function, which is called diminishing ability.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c19_11']	此二事何位何因得成？	此二事何位何因得成？	013	In what stage and by what causes are these two things accomplished?
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c22_8']	若人住願樂位中，聞如來說廣大甚深正教，於中起三信，願樂修行隨順不違，此損益以聞熏習力為因，聞思慧為聞熏習體。	若人住願樂位中，聞如來說廣大甚深正教，於中起三信，願樂修行隨順不違，此損益以聞熏習力為因，聞思慧為聞熏習體。	013	If a person abides in the stage of faith and joy, hears the Tathāgata's vast and profound true teachings, gives rise to the three kinds of faith, and practices in accordance with the teachings without contradiction, this diminishing and increasing is caused by the power of hearing and cultivation. The essence of hearing and cultivation is the hearing and contemplation wisdoms.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c23_5']	因此二慧生修慧，修慧是聞熏習力。	因此二慧生修慧，修慧是聞熏習力。	013	Based on these two wisdoms, one gives rise to the cultivation wisdom. The cultivation wisdom is the power of hearing and cultivation.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c23_17']	若無修慧，本依則不得轉。	若無修慧，本依則不得轉。	013	If there is no cultivated wisdom, the original basis cannot be transformed.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c24_7']	由此力故損益義成。	由此力故損益義成。	013	By this power, the meaning of benefit and harm is established.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c25_6']	若人已得如此轉依，煩惱行於此人云何？	若人已得如此轉依，煩惱行於此人云何？	013	If a person has already attained this transformation of the basis, how do the activities of afflictions occur for that person?
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c26_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c26_18']	由煩惱有羞行、慚弱行或永不行故。	由煩惱有羞行、慚弱行或永不行故。	013	Because of the existence of afflictions, there are those who act with shame, those who act with weak shame, and those who never act.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c27_2']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary says:

['ZH_T31_1595_013:0247c28_16']	又復微弱，或永不起。	又復微弱，或永不起。	013	Moreover, they are weak, or they never arise.

['ZH_T31_1595_013:0248a02_9']	釋曰：	釋曰：	013	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0248a03_4']	得無分別智證真如，故名通達。	得無分別智證真如，故名通達。	013	Attaining non-discriminating wisdom and realizing true suchness is called thorough understanding.
['ZH_T31_1595_013:0248a03_17']	由此通達，有別轉異於地前。	由此通達，有別轉異於地前。	013	By this thorough understanding, there is a separate transformation different from the stage before the grounds.
