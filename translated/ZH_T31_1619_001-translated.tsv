Because sentient beings' confused minds discriminate them within consciousness, they give rise to discriminations of the six sense objects. These discriminations appear as if external, and within the four conditions, they are called the condition qua object of perception for consciousness, because they are the characteristics of the essence of consciousness and because consciousness arises from them.
