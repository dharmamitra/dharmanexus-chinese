['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b08_7']	辯賢聖品第七之三已辯見修二道生異，當依此道分位差別建立眾聖補特伽羅。	辯賢聖品第七之三已辯見修二道生異，當依此道分位差別建立眾聖補特伽羅。	031	Chapter 7, Part 3: Distinguishing the Noble Ones, has already explained the differences in the arising of the two paths of seeing and cultivation. One should rely on the distinctions in the stages of these paths to establish the various noble beings.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b09_9']	且依見道十五心位建立眾聖有差別者，頌曰：	且依見道十五心位建立眾聖有差別者，頌曰：	031	As for establishing the distinctions among the noble ones based on the fifteen moments of mind in the path of seeing, the verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b10_0']	名隨信法行，　　由根鈍利別，	名隨信法行，　　由根鈍利別，	031	They are called followers of faith and followers of the dharma, distinguished by dull and sharp faculties,
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b11_0']	具脩惑斷一，　　至五向初果，	具脩惑斷一，　　至五向初果，	031	Fully possessing afflictions to be eliminated, up to five, heading towards the first fruit,
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b12_13']	斷次三向二，　　離八地向三。	斷次三向二，　　離八地向三。	031	Eliminating the next three, heading towards the second, free from the eight stages, heading towards the third.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b13_2']	論曰：	論曰：	031	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b14_10']	見道位中聖者有二，一隨信行、二隨法行，由根鈍利別立二名。	見道位中聖者有二，一隨信行、二隨法行，由根鈍利別立二名。	031	In the stage of the path of seeing, there are two kinds of noble ones: followers of faith and followers of the dharma. The two names are established based on the distinctions of dull and sharp faculties.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b15_10']	諸鈍根名隨信行者，由先信敬力修集加行故。	諸鈍根名隨信行者，由先信敬力修集加行故。	031	Those of dull faculties are called followers of faith, because they cultivated the preparations based on the power of faith and respect from before.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b16_12']	諸利根名隨法行者，由先樂觀察修集加行故。	諸利根名隨法行者，由先樂觀察修集加行故。	031	Those of sharp faculties are called followers of the dharma, because they cultivated the preparations based on delighting in contemplation from before.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b19_11']	諸有情類種姓差別，法爾先來如是安住，於諸事業有不樂觀、或有樂觀能不能轉，即二聖者由於修惑具斷有殊，立為三向。	諸有情類種姓差別，法爾先來如是安住，於諸事業有不樂觀、或有樂觀能不能轉，即二聖者由於修惑具斷有殊，立為三向。	031	The various kinds of sentient beings are distinguished by their spiritual genes, which are established naturally from beginningless time. Some are not inclined to observe the various activities of the world, and some are inclined to observe them. Those who are able to change their inclinations are called the two kinds of noble ones. Because of the difference in the complete or incomplete abandonment of the passions that are objects to be eliminated by the path of cultivation, they are established as the three kinds of candidates for the fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b20_14']	謂彼二聖，若於先來未以世道斷修斷惑，名為具縛。	謂彼二聖，若於先來未以世道斷修斷惑，名為具縛。	031	That is, if the two kinds of noble ones have not previously eliminated the passions that are objects to be eliminated by the path of cultivation by means of the worldly path, they are called those who are bound by all the bonds.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b22_3']	或先已斷欲界一品乃至五品，至此位中名初果向，趣初果故。	或先已斷欲界一品乃至五品，至此位中名初果向，趣初果故。	031	Or, if they have previously eliminated one to five categories of the passions of the realm of desire, they are called candidates for the first fruit when they reach this stage, because they are approaching the first fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b23_6']	言初果者，謂預流果，此於一切沙門果中必初得故。	言初果者，謂預流果，此於一切沙門果中必初得故。	031	The first fruit is called the fruit of stream-enterer, because it is necessarily the first of all the fruits of śramaṇas.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b24_17']	若先已斷欲界六品或七八品，至此位中名第二果向，趣第二果故。	若先已斷欲界六品或七八品，至此位中名第二果向，趣第二果故。	031	If they have previously eliminated six, seven, or eight categories of the passions of the realm of desire, they are called candidates for the second fruit when they reach this stage, because they are approaching the second fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b25_17']	第二果者，謂一來果，遍得果中此第二故。	第二果者，謂一來果，遍得果中此第二故。	031	The second fruit is called the fruit of once-returner, because it is the second of the fruits of the śramaṇa.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b28_2']	若先已離欲界九品，或先已斷初定一品，乃至具離無所有處，至此位中名第三果向，趣第三果故。	若先已離欲界九品，或先已斷初定一品，乃至具離無所有處，至此位中名第三果向，趣第三果故。	031	If one has previously already been free from the nine grades of passion of the desire realm, or has previously already eliminated the first trance, up to being completely free from the sphere of nothingness, at this stage one is called the third fruit-stage, because one is heading for the third fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925b28_17']	第三果者，謂不還果，數准前釋。	第三果者，謂不還果，數准前釋。	031	The third fruit is called the fruit of non-returner. The number is explained as before.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c01_4']	如是隨信隨法行者，由先具縛斷惑有殊，數別各成七十三種。	如是隨信隨法行者，由先具縛斷惑有殊，數別各成七十三種。	031	Thus, the followers of faith and followers of the dharma, due to the differences in eliminating delusions while still bound by all, are separately established as seventy-three types.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c02_3']	謂於欲界具縛為初，至斷九品以為第十。	謂於欲界具縛為初，至斷九品以為第十。	031	That is to say, from being bound by all in the desire realm as the first, up to eliminating the ninth grade as the tenth.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c03_2']	如是乃至無所有處，地地各九，為七十三。	如是乃至無所有處，地地各九，為七十三。	031	In this way, up to the sphere of nothingness, each ground has nine, making seventy-three.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c04_1']	諸後具縛即前離九，故後七地無別具縛。	諸後具縛即前離九，故後七地無別具縛。	031	The subsequent bound by all is the previous free from nine, therefore the latter seven grounds have no separate bound by all.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c05_2']	次依修道道類智時建立眾聖有差別者，頌曰：	次依修道道類智時建立眾聖有差別者，頌曰：	031	Next, based on the time of the path of cultivation and the knowledge of the classes of the path, the establishment of the differences of the various sages is as follows. A verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c06_0']	至第十六心，　　隨三向住果，	至第十六心，　　隨三向住果，	031	Up to the sixteenth thought, following the three directions and abiding in the fruits,
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c07_13']	名信解見至，　　亦由鈍利別。	名信解見至，　　亦由鈍利別。	031	Are called faith-understanding and view-attainment, also due to the distinctions of dull and sharp.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c08_2']	論曰：	論曰：	031	The Treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c09_19']	即前隨信、隨法行者，至第十六道類智心，名為住果不復名向，隨前三向今住三果。	即前隨信、隨法行者，至第十六道類智心，名為住果不復名向，隨前三向今住三果。	031	Those who previously followed faith and those who previously followed the teachings, when they reach the sixteenth mind of the path of insight into the four truths, are called abiders in the fruit and are no longer called candidates. They abide in the three fruits according to the previous three candidates.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c11_12']	謂前預流向今住預流果，前一來向今住一來果，前不還向今住不還果。	謂前預流向今住預流果，前一來向今住一來果，前不還向今住不還果。	031	That is, those who were previously candidates for the fruit of stream-enterer now abide in the fruit of stream-enterer; those who were previously candidates for the fruit of once-returner now abide in the fruit of once-returner; those who were previously candidates for the fruit of non-returner now abide in the fruit of non-returner.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c13_1']	阿羅漢果必無初得，異生無容離有頂故，見道無容斷修惑故。	阿羅漢果必無初得，異生無容離有頂故，見道無容斷修惑故。	031	The fruit of arhatship is definitely not attained for the first time, because ordinary beings are not able to be free from the peak of existence, and the path of insight is not able to eliminate the proclivities to be eliminated by cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c14_18']	至住果位，捨得二名，謂不復名隨信法行，轉得信解、見至二名，此亦由根鈍利差別。	至住果位，捨得二名，謂不復名隨信法行，轉得信解、見至二名，此亦由根鈍利差別。	031	When one reaches the stage of abiding in the fruit, one abandons the two names of candidate and obtains the two names of one who attains through faith and one who attains through views. This is also due to the difference of dullness and sharpness of faculties.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c16_4']	諸鈍根者，先名隨信行，今名信解，由信增上力勝解顯故。	諸鈍根者，先名隨信行，今名信解，由信增上力勝解顯故。	031	Those of dull faculties, who were previously called those who follow faith, are now called those who attain through faith, because the power of faith is superior and resolve is manifested.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c17_9']	諸利根者，先名隨法行，今名見至，由慧增上力正見顯故。	諸利根者，先名隨法行，今名見至，由慧增上力正見顯故。	031	Those of sharp faculties, who were previously called those who follow the teachings, are now called those who attain through views, because the power of wisdom is superior and right views are manifested.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c20_22']	何緣先時斷修所斷欲一至五、或七八品、初定一品，廣說乃至無所有處第九品惑，至第十六道類智心，但名預流、一來、不還果，非一來、不還、阿羅漢向？	何緣先時斷修所斷欲一至五、或七八品、初定一品，廣說乃至無所有處第九品惑，至第十六道類智心，但名預流、一來、不還果，非一來、不還、阿羅漢向？	031	Why is it that when one has previously eliminated one to five degrees of the passions that are to be eliminated by cultivation in the realm of desire, or seven or eight degrees, or one degree of the first trance state, and so on, up to the ninth degree of the ninth trance state, and at the time of the sixteenth mind of the path of insight into the truths, one is only called a “stream-winner,” “once-returner,” or “non-returner,” and not a “once-returner,” “non-returner,” or “arhat”?
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c21_2']	頌曰：	頌曰：	031	A verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c22_0']	諸得果位中，　　未得勝果道，	諸得果位中，　　未得勝果道，	031	In the state of attaining the fruit, one has not yet attained the path of the superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c23_13']	故未起勝道，　　名住果非向。	故未起勝道，　　名住果非向。	031	Therefore, before the superior path is produced, one is called a dweller in the fruit and not a candidate for the fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c24_2']	論曰：	論曰：	031	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c26_2']	依得聖道建立八聖，故初得果位未得勝果道，以得果心於勝果道所對治惑非對治故。	依得聖道建立八聖，故初得果位未得勝果道，以得果心於勝果道所對治惑非對治故。	031	The eight saints are established on the basis of the attainment of the path of the saints. Therefore, in the state of first attaining the fruit, one has not yet attained the path of the superior fruit. Because the mind that attains the fruit is not the antidote to the passions that are to be eliminated by the path of the superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c27_2']	非非彼治現在前時得彼治道，其理決定。	非非彼治現在前時得彼治道，其理決定。	031	It is definitely not the case that when the antidote to those passions is present, one attains the path that is the antidote to them.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0925c28_14']	又非得果時即有勝果道所斷煩惱離繫得生，道類忍不能斷彼繫得故。	又非得果時即有勝果道所斷煩惱離繫得生，道類忍不能斷彼繫得故。	031	Also, when one attains the fruit, the acquisition of the separation from the bonds that are eliminated by the path of the superior fruit does not arise, because the receptivity to the knowledge of the doctrine in regard to the path cannot eliminate the acquisition of those bonds.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a01_16']	若道力能斷彼繫得，此道引彼離繫得生，可說此道能證彼滅，以得前果時未得勝果道故。	若道力能斷彼繫得，此道引彼離繫得生，可說此道能證彼滅，以得前果時未得勝果道故。	031	If the power of the path can sever the acquisition of those bonds, and this path induces the arising of the acquisition of separation from those bonds, then it can be said that this path can realize the cessation of those bonds. Because when one attains a prior fruit, one has not yet attained the path of a superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a03_14']	住果者乃至未起勝果道時，雖先已斷修所斷惑欲一品等，但名住果，不名後向。	住果者乃至未起勝果道時，雖先已斷修所斷惑欲一品等，但名住果，不名後向。	031	Even though one who abides in a fruit has already severed the first category of the passions to be eliminated by cultivation, etc., he is only said to abide in a fruit and not to be a candidate for the subsequent fruit until he generates the path of a superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a04_11']	後於何時得先所斷修惑離繫無漏得耶？	後於何時得先所斷修惑離繫無漏得耶？	031	At what time does one acquire the pure acquisition of separation from the passions to be eliminated by cultivation that were previously severed?
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a05_6']	於勝果道現前時得為諸先斷。	於勝果道現前時得為諸先斷。	031	One acquires them when the path of a superior fruit is present.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a06_10']	後修斷惑入離生位得前果已，此生定起勝果道耶？	後修斷惑入離生位得前果已，此生定起勝果道耶？	031	After one has severed all the passions to be eliminated by cultivation and has entered the state of being free from passions, does one necessarily generate the path of a superior fruit in this life after having attained a prior fruit?
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a06_15']	理必應然。	理必應然。	031	Reason demands that this must be so.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a06_20']	以本論說：	以本論說：	031	Because the Śāstra says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a08_16']	聖生第四靜慮以上，無漏樂根定成就故，彼障已斷必欣彼故，障已斷道易現前故。	聖生第四靜慮以上，無漏樂根定成就故，彼障已斷必欣彼故，障已斷道易現前故。	031	Holy ones born in the fourth trance state and above necessarily accomplish the pure faculty of pleasure, because they must delight in it since its obstacle has already been eliminated, and because the path that eliminates its obstacle is easy to manifest.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a11_4']	如是已依先具倍離及全離欲入見諦者十六心位立眾聖別，當約修惑辯漸次生能對治道分位差別。	如是已依先具倍離及全離欲入見諦者十六心位立眾聖別，當約修惑辯漸次生能對治道分位差別。	031	Thus, in the sixteen moments of the path of seeing, those who have already completely or partially abandoned the desires of the realm of desire are established as the various holy beings. Now, in terms of the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm, we will discuss the gradual arising of the counteracting paths and their stages of distinction.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a11_7']	頌曰：	頌曰：	031	A verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a12_13']	地地失德九，　　下中上各三。	地地失德九，　　下中上各三。	031	In each stage, there are nine faults and virtues, each divided into three levels: lower, middle, and upper.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a13_2']	論曰：	論曰：	031	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a13_12']	失謂過失，即所治障。	失謂過失，即所治障。	031	Faults refer to faults, which are the obstacles to be eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a14_1']	德謂功德，即能治道。	德謂功德，即能治道。	031	Virtues refer to virtues, which are the counteracting paths.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a15_17']	如先已辯欲修斷惑九品差別，上四靜慮及四無色應知亦然，生死無非九地攝故。	如先已辯欲修斷惑九品差別，上四靜慮及四無色應知亦然，生死無非九地攝故。	031	As explained above, the afflictions to be eliminated through cultivation are divided into nine grades. The four formless concentrations and the four formless absorptions should be understood in the same way, because birth and death are subsumed in the nine stages.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a17_6']	如所治障一一地中各有九品，諸能治道無間解脫九品亦然。	如所治障一一地中各有九品，諸能治道無間解脫九品亦然。	031	Just as the obstacles to be eliminated are divided into nine grades in each stage, the counteracting paths, the uninterrupted paths and the liberated paths, are also divided into nine grades in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a17_15']	失德如何各分九品？	失德如何各分九品？	031	How are the faults and virtues each divided into nine grades?
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a20_9']	謂根本品有下中上，此三各分下中上別，由此失德各分九品，謂下下、下中、下上、中下、中中、中上、上下、上中、上上品。	謂根本品有下中上，此三各分下中上別，由此失德各分九品，謂下下、下中、下上、中下、中中、中上、上下、上中、上上品。	031	That is, the fundamental stage has three grades, superior, medium, and inferior, and each of these is divided into three, superior, medium, and inferior. Consequently, errors and virtues are divided into nine grades. That is, inferior-inferior, inferior-medium, inferior-superior, medium-inferior, medium-medium, medium-superior, superior-inferior, superior-medium, and superior-superior.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a23_12']	應知此中下下品道勢力能斷上上品障，如是乃至上上品道勢力能斷下下品障，上上品等諸能治德初未有故，此德有時上上品等失已無故。	應知此中下下品道勢力能斷上上品障，如是乃至上上品道勢力能斷下下品障，上上品等諸能治德初未有故，此德有時上上品等失已無故。	031	You must understand that the power of the path of the inferior-superior grade can eliminate the obstacle of the superior-superior grade, and so on, up to the power of the path of the superior-superior grade that can eliminate the obstacle of the inferior-inferior grade. Because the superior-superior grade, etc., of the virtues that are antidotes do not yet exist at the beginning, and because at the time when these virtues exist, the errors of the superior-superior grade, etc., no longer exist.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a24_12']	應知此中智雖勝惑，未增盛故道名下品。	應知此中智雖勝惑，未增盛故道名下品。	031	You must understand that in this context, even though knowledge is superior to delusion, it is called the inferior grade of the path because it is not yet vigorous.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a25_11']	相續中惑雖極難斷，細隨行故障名下品。	相續中惑雖極難斷，細隨行故障名下品。	031	Even though the delusion in a continuum is extremely difficult to eliminate because it is subtle and follows along, the obstacle is called the inferior grade.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a26_19']	依如是理應立譬喻，如浣衣位麁垢先除，於後後時漸除細垢。	依如是理應立譬喻，如浣衣位麁垢先除，於後後時漸除細垢。	031	In accordance with this principle, you should establish a simile, just as in the process of washing clothes, coarse stains are removed first, and then gradually finer stains are removed.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a27_17']	又如麁闇小明能滅，要以大明方滅細闇。	又如麁闇小明能滅，要以大明方滅細闇。	031	Also, it is like the case where coarse darkness is extinguished by a small light, but subtle darkness is extinguished only by a great light.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a28_7']	失德相對理亦應然。	失德相對理亦應然。	031	The principle of the contrast between faults and virtues is also like this.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926a29_14']	由此可言白勝黑劣，以剎那頃能治道生拔無始來諸惑根故。	由此可言白勝黑劣，以剎那頃能治道生拔無始來諸惑根故。	031	For this reason, it can be said that the good overcomes the bad, because the path of elimination arises for a moment and uproots the roots of all passions that have existed since beginningless time.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926b01_14']	已辯失德差別九品，次當依彼立聖者別。	已辯失德差別九品，次當依彼立聖者別。	031	Having distinguished the nine grades of faults and virtues, next we will establish the distinctions among the holy ones based on them.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926b03_12']	且諸有學修道位中，總亦名為信解、見至，隨位復有多種差別，先應建立都未斷者。	且諸有學修道位中，總亦名為信解、見至，隨位復有多種差別，先應建立都未斷者。	031	First, those in the path of cultivation who have not yet eliminated any of the passions are generally called those liberated by faith and those who have attained insight, but there are many distinctions based on their stages. We will first establish those who have not yet eliminated any of the passions.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926b03_15']	頌曰：	頌曰：	031	A verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926b04_13']	未斷修斷失，　　住果極七返。	未斷修斷失，　　住果極七返。	031	Those who have not yet eliminated the losses of the passions eliminated in the path of cultivation are called those who attain the fruit of stream-entry and return to the world up to seven times.
['ZH_T29_1563_031:0926b05_2']	論曰：	論曰：	031	The commentary says:
