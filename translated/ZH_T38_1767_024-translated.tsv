The middle is precisely the meaning of birth and death.
['ZH_T38_1767_024:0176b18_4']	言中道者，兩因夾一果，一果居中，如此論中方是妙中，破生死義。	言中道者，兩因夾一果，一果居中，如此論中方是妙中，破生死義。	As for the middle way, two causes sandwich one fruit, with one fruit in the middle. In this treatise, this is the wonderful middle that refutes the meaning of birth and death.
