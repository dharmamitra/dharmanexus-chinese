['ZH_T38_1767_003:0052c24_18']	一辨疏密、二辨德行、三釋名。	一辨疏密、二辨德行、三釋名。	003	1. Distinguishing the explicit and implicit, 2. Distinguishing virtues and practices, 3. Explaining the name.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0052c26_11']	初意者，依天竺文猶屬〈壽命品〉開破今昔常無常義，於義則密、於文則疏；	初意者，依天竺文猶屬〈壽命品〉開破今昔常無常義，於義則密、於文則疏；	003	The first meaning is based on the Indian text, which still belongs to the Lifespan Chapter. It opens up the meaning of permanence and impermanence in the past and present, which is implicit in meaning but explicit in text;
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0052c27_12']	謝氏從人從事題純陀品，於文則密、於義則疏。	謝氏從人從事題純陀品，於文則密、於義則疏。	003	The Xie family titles it the Cunda Chapter based on the person and the event, which is explicit in text but implicit in meaning.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0052c29_7']	今明涅槃施章，於梵漢兩文俱無所失，隨前人則施常命、隨後事則施常修云云。	今明涅槃施章，於梵漢兩文俱無所失，隨前人則施常命、隨後事則施常修云云。	003	Now, clarifying the chapter on giving in the nirvāṇa, in both Indian and Chinese texts, there is no loss. Following the previous person, it gives permanence and life; following the later event, it gives the practice of permanence and so on.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a01_8']	次德行者，純陀是二恒之數，何故別立一品？	次德行者，純陀是二恒之數，何故別立一品？	003	Next, as for virtues and practices, Cunda is one of the two Ganges' sands. Why is a separate chapter established for him?
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a01_13']	略明十異：	略明十異：	003	Briefly, ten differences are clarified:

['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a07_2']	純陀十異逈超眾表，何不前供而後獻耶？	純陀十異逈超眾表，何不前供而後獻耶？	003	Pure Gift's ten differences are far beyond the common people, so why did he not offer first and then present?

['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a07_12']	後供者讓他德也。	後供者讓他德也。	003	The later offerings are to give way to the virtue of others.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a08_17']	舊明五讓，謂賤讓貴、凡讓聖、麁讓妙、少讓多、近讓遠。	舊明五讓，謂賤讓貴、凡讓聖、麁讓妙、少讓多、近讓遠。	003	The old explanation of the five ways of giving way is: the humble give way to the noble, the ordinary give way to the sages, the coarse give way to the wonderful, the few give way to the many, and the near give way to the far.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a09_3']	今依文宜為十讓：	今依文宜為十讓：	003	Now, according to the text, there should be ten ways of giving way:
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a09_14']	初以俗讓道，謂僧尼眾；	初以俗讓道，謂僧尼眾；	003	First, using the secular to give way to the Way, referring to the assembly of monks and nuns;
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a10_4']	次以凡讓聖，謂學無學；	次以凡讓聖，謂學無學；	003	Next, using the ordinary to give way to the sages, referring to those in training and those beyond training;
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a10_15']	三以淺讓深，謂諸菩薩；	三以淺讓深，謂諸菩薩；	003	Third, using the shallow to give way to the profound, referring to the bodhisattvas;

['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a11_19']	五以顯讓冥，謂天龍鬼神；	五以顯讓冥，謂天龍鬼神；	003	Fifth, using the manifest to yield to the obscure, referring to heavenly dragons and spirits;
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a12_11']	六以少麁讓多妙，謂人天等；	六以少麁讓多妙，謂人天等；	003	Sixth, using the few coarse to yield to the many wonderful, referring to humans and gods;
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a13_2']	七以財讓法，即是魔眾；	七以財讓法，即是魔眾；	003	Seventh, using wealth to yield to the Dharma, referring to the demon hordes;
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a13_17']	八以同類讓異類，即師子鳥蠭等；	八以同類讓異類，即師子鳥蠭等；	003	Eighth, using the same kind to yield to the different kind, referring to lions, birds, and insects;
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a14_9']	九以近讓遠，謂十方菩薩；	九以近讓遠，謂十方菩薩；	003	Ninth, using the near to yield to the far, referring to bodhisattvas in the ten directions;

['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a15_16']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a16_8']	何故昔默今默而有受不受異？	何故昔默今默而有受不受異？	003	Why was there silence in the past and silence now, with the difference of acceptance and non-acceptance?
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a16_10']	答：	答：	003	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a17_1']	佛意難如，今通別兩解。	佛意難如，今通別兩解。	003	The Buddha's intention is difficult to fathom. Now there are two general and specific explanations.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a19_7']	今昔二默俱是四悉，世人所默有受不受，佛隨世界故有二默受不受異，或宜默受、宜默不受，二俱生善。	今昔二默俱是四悉，世人所默有受不受，佛隨世界故有二默受不受異，或宜默受、宜默不受，二俱生善。	003	The two silences of the past and present are both the four siddhāntas. People who are silent may or may not accept. The Buddha follows the world and therefore has two silences, with the difference of acceptance and non-acceptance. Some are suitable to accept silence, some are suitable to not accept silence, both of which give rise to goodness.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a20_14']	欲生彼善故有二默，破惡得道亦復如是，聖無唐捐非凡所測。	欲生彼善故有二默，破惡得道亦復如是，聖無唐捐非凡所測。	003	In order to give rise to good in them, there are two kinds of silence. Destroying evil and attaining the Way is also like this. The sages do not speak pointlessly, and this is not something ordinary people can fathom.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a22_3']	別釋者，時眾無奇緣弱不感，令追責往緣，是名世界默然不受。	別釋者，時眾無奇緣弱不感，令追責往緣，是名世界默然不受。	003	The specific explanation is this: The assembly at that time had no extraordinary causes and conditions, and their weak feelings did not move the Buddha. The Buddha made them pursue and reflect on their past causes and conditions. This is called the worldly silence and refusal to accept.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a23_14']	初若發言不受則後供息心，眾供都集普皆等受，是名為人默然不受。	初若發言不受則後供息心，眾供都集普皆等受，是名為人默然不受。	003	If at the beginning he had spoken and refused to accept, then later the offerings would have ceased. The assembly's offerings were all gathered and universally equally accepted. This is called the human silence and refusal to accept.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a25_10']	默不受者，貶其不能因食以明不食，開無常顯常無勝治力，是名對治默然不受。	默不受者，貶其不能因食以明不食，開無常顯常無勝治力，是名對治默然不受。	003	The silence and refusal to accept deprecates their inability to use food to clarify not eating. It opens up the impermanent and reveals the permanent, without the power of a superior remedy. This is called the counteractive silence and refusal to accept.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a26_18']	若是食身可默受食，法身常諸無食無受，是名第一義默然不受。	若是食身可默受食，法身常諸無食無受，是名第一義默然不受。	003	If it were the body of food, one could silently accept the food. But the Dharma body is permanent, without food or acceptance. This is called the ultimate truth silence and refusal to accept.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a27_18']	默然不受是佛境界，義不可盡，略言四耳。	默然不受是佛境界，義不可盡，略言四耳。	003	The silence and refusal to accept is the Buddha's realm. The meaning cannot be exhausted. It is briefly said to be four.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a28_8']	三釋名者，純陀名也。	三釋名者，純陀名也。	003	Third, the explanation of the names. Pure Giving is the name.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a29_6']	六卷云「姓華名子純，子之與陀二文互出。	六卷云「姓華名子純，子之與陀二文互出。	003	The six-fascicle text says, His surname is Hua, and his personal name is Zichun. The two texts of Zichun and Tuo appear alternately.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053a29_10']	」舊云：	」舊云：	003	The old texts say:
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b01_4']	本名純陀，後大眾稱德號為妙義。	本名純陀，後大眾稱德號為妙義。	003	His original name was Chuntuo, and later the great assembly praised his virtues and called him Miaoyi.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b01_9']	今則不然。	今則不然。	003	This is not so now.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b02_1']	純陀是彼音，妙義是此語。	純陀是彼音，妙義是此語。	003	Chuntuo is their sound, and Miaoyi is our language.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b03_16']	先立嘉名為最後作瑞，所以大眾稱美，不應名德兩分，例如善吉空生即其儔也。	先立嘉名為最後作瑞，所以大眾稱美，不應名德兩分，例如善吉空生即其儔也。	003	First establishing a beautiful name is the last auspicious act. The reason the great assembly praises him is that his name and virtue should not be divided into two. It is similar to Subhūti and Ānanda.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b05_22']	然妙義淵博不可言盡，略示其十，謂義妙、解妙、檀妙、位妙、德妙、感妙、通妙、說妙、田妙、益妙。	然妙義淵博不可言盡，略示其十，謂義妙、解妙、檀妙、位妙、德妙、感妙、通妙、說妙、田妙、益妙。	003	However, Miaoyi is profound and cannot be fully expressed. I will briefly show ten aspects, namely, the subtlety of meaning, the subtlety of understanding, the subtlety of giving, the subtlety of stage, the subtlety of virtue, the subtlety of inspiration, the subtlety of spiritual powers, the subtlety of teaching, the subtlety of field, and the subtlety of benefit.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b07_8']	義妙者，三點四德不縱不橫不並不別，佛及眾生皆悉安住祕密藏中。	義妙者，三點四德不縱不橫不並不別，佛及眾生皆悉安住祕密藏中。	003	The subtlety of meaning refers to the three dots and four virtues, which are neither vertical nor horizontal, neither combined nor separate. Both buddhas and sentient beings all abide in the secret treasury.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b08_10']	文云「諸佛境界不可思議，一切法中有安樂性。	文云「諸佛境界不可思議，一切法中有安樂性。	003	The text says, The realm of buddhas is inconceivable. All dharmas have the nature of bliss.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b10_1']	」解妙者，解大涅槃微妙智慧，照窮理性動合機宜，發心畢竟等無差別。	」解妙者，解大涅槃微妙智慧，照窮理性動合機宜，發心畢竟等無差別。	003	Understanding the subtle means understanding the subtle wisdom of great nirvana, illuminating the principle to the end and harmonizing with the capacities of beings, with no difference between the initial and final stages of generating the mind.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b11_2']	文云「言純陀者，名解妙義，雖受人身心如佛心。	文云「言純陀者，名解妙義，雖受人身心如佛心。	003	The text says, As for Cunda, his name means 'understanding subtle meaning.' Although he has a human body, his mind is like the Buddha's mind.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b11_20']	」檀妙者，八斛四斗充足一切鍼鋒大眾。	」檀妙者，八斛四斗充足一切鍼鋒大眾。	003	The subtlety of giving means that eight bushels and four pecks of food can satisfy the entire great assembly, down to the tip of a needle.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b12_11']	文云「令汝具足檀波羅蜜。	文云「令汝具足檀波羅蜜。	003	The text says, It will enable you to perfect the perfection of giving.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b14_11']	」位妙者，雖在居家蓋諸無學，工巧之賤、釋梵歸仰，如盛滿月映蔽星辰，是優婆塞等法王子。	」位妙者，雖在居家蓋諸無學，工巧之賤、釋梵歸仰，如盛滿月映蔽星辰，是優婆塞等法王子。	003	The subtlety of status means that although he is a layperson, he surpasses all those beyond study. The lowly craft of a butcher is revered by Śakra and Brahmā, like the full moon outshining the stars. He is an upāsaka and a Dharma prince.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b15_3']	文云「如幼出家墮大僧數。	文云「如幼出家墮大僧數。	003	The text says, Like a young monk, he is counted among the great assembly of monks.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b16_3', 'ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b16_11']	」德妙者，如前十異十讓，為佛為眾之所稱歎。🔽文云「南無純陀！	」德妙者，如前十異十讓，為佛為眾之所稱歎。 文云「南無純陀！	003	The subtlety of virtue means the ten differences and ten remissions mentioned above, praised by the Buddha and the assembly.🔽The text says, Homage to Cunda!
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b16_16']	南無純陀！	南無純陀！	003	Homage to Cunda!
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b17_4']	而為我等之所瞻仰。	而為我等之所瞻仰。	003	We look up to him.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b18_10']	」感妙者，東方佛使作大神通，人天枯燥，齎持香飯獻而不受。	」感妙者，東方佛使作大神通，人天枯燥，齎持香飯獻而不受。	003	The wonderful object refers to the Buddhas of the east manifesting great spiritual powers, causing humans and gods to wither, bringing fragrant food to offer but not accepting it.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b20_4']	九方亦爾況復人天，純陀一請即為哀納，故知物妙非妙、食麁不麁，非麁非妙。	九方亦爾況復人天，純陀一請即為哀納，故知物妙非妙、食麁不麁，非麁非妙。	003	The Buddhas of the nine directions are also like this, let alone humans and gods. Pūrṇa alone invited them and they pitifully accepted it. Therefore, know that the object is wonderful, not wonderful; the food is coarse, not coarse, neither coarse nor wonderful.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b21_1']	文云「普為大會哀受純陀最後供養。	文云「普為大會哀受純陀最後供養。	003	The text says, Universally pitifully accepting Pūrṇa's final offering for the great assembly.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b22_12']	」神通妙者，始辦供具地六種動，正獻食時說十三偈，如經，即神通妙。	」神通妙者，始辦供具地六種動，正獻食時說十三偈，如經，即神通妙。	003	The wonderful spiritual powers refer to when the offerings were prepared, the earth shook in six ways. When the food was presented, thirteen verses were spoken, as in the sūtra, which are the wonderful spiritual powers.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b23_7']	說妙者，巧興五難善覆有為，如經。	說妙者，巧興五難善覆有為，如經。	003	The wonderful explanation refers to skillfully raising five difficulties and well covering conditioned arising, as in the sūtra.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b23_20']	田妙者，最後入滅是良福田。	田妙者，最後入滅是良福田。	003	The wonderful field refers to entering extinction for the last time, which is a good field of blessings.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b24_11']	文云「汝為眾生作良福田。	文云「汝為眾生作良福田。	003	The text says, You are a good field of blessings for sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b26_2']	」益妙者，因受其供普受大會則財益，一切因食開常即法益一切，如經。	」益妙者，因受其供普受大會則財益，一切因食開常即法益一切，如經。	003	The wonderful benefit refers to universally accepting the great assembly based on accepting the offerings, which is the benefit of wealth. All universally open up the eternal based on the food, which is the benefit of the Dharma, as in the sūtra.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b27_7']	純陀大士具此十妙及餘無量一切諸妙，故名純陀品。	純陀大士具此十妙及餘無量一切諸妙，故名純陀品。	003	The great being Cunda possesses these ten wonderful things and many other immeasurable wonderful things, therefore it is called the chapter on Cunda.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b28_14']	若依經名應言十大，若依人名故言十妙，妙之與大左右之異。	若依經名應言十大，若依人名故言十妙，妙之與大左右之異。	003	If based on the sutra title, it should be called the ten great; if based on the person's name, it is called the ten wonderful. Wonderful and great are different in left and right.
['ZH_T38_1767_003:0053b29_5']	從此訖眾問是涅槃施。	從此訖眾問是涅槃施。	003	From here to the questions of the assembly is the giving of nirvana.
