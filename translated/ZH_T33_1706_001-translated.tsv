['ZH_T33_1706_001:0286c27_9']	二約教釋者，一家教門以藏、通、別、圓為釋義之綱目，故一一文義必約此四以辯淺深，則教旨有歸、機解無失。	二約教釋者，一家教門以藏、通、別、圓為釋義之綱目，故一一文義必約此四以辯淺深，則教旨有歸、機解無失。	As for the second, explaining based on the teachings, the teachings of our school take the Tripitaka, Shared, Distinct, and Perfect teachings as the framework for explaining the meaning, thus each and every textual meaning must be discussed in terms of these four to discern the shallow and profound, then the purport of the teachings has a destination and the understanding of the capacities is not mistaken.

['ZH_T33_1706_001:0286c29_12']	初明藏教。	初明藏教。	The first is explaining the Tripitaka teachings.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a01_4']	若見諸法生等，則藏詮生滅。	若見諸法生等，則藏詮生滅。	If one sees the arising of all dharmas and so on, then the Tripitaka teaches arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a02_6']	法不即空，必析滅會空，故生即有也、滅即空也。	法不即空，必析滅會空，故生即有也、滅即空也。	Dharmas are not empty, one must analyze and cease to unite with emptiness, thus arising is existence and ceasing is emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a02_18']	空則塵等皆容，是為國義。	空則塵等皆容，是為國義。	Emptiness then accommodates all phenomena and so on, this is the meaning of the country.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a03_15']	故不動轉，約文帖釋，則國安而王泰也。	故不動轉，約文帖釋，則國安而王泰也。	Therefore, it is unshakable. If explained according to the text, then the country is secure and the king is at peace.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a05_3']	二乘所得名為王者，以果從因而實兼果，對土可知，餘三例爾。	二乘所得名為王者，以果從因而實兼果，對土可知，餘三例爾。	The attainment of the two vehicles is called the king. Following the cause and actually including the fruit, it can be known in contrast to the land. The other three are the same.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a06_9']	通詮諸法色即是空，與藏體析之異，故不生滅，悉如幻化。	通詮諸法色即是空，與藏體析之異，故不生滅，悉如幻化。	Universally revealing all dharmas, form is precisely emptiness, different from the Hīnayāna's analysis of the essence. Therefore, it is non-arising and non-ceasing, all like magical transformations.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a07_3']	三界煩惱一時頓斷，從果言也。	三界煩惱一時頓斷，從果言也。	The afflictions of the three realms are suddenly severed at once. Speaking from the fruit.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a07_13']	若亦從因，仍通次斷。	若亦從因，仍通次斷。	If also speaking from the cause, it still generally includes gradual severance.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a08_16']	「住於界外」下，約文帖釋也，別詮三諦次第，言空不異；	「住於界外」下，約文帖釋也，別詮三諦次第，言空不異；	Abiding outside the realm and below is the explanation according to the text. Separately revealing the three truths in sequence, speaking of emptiness is no different;
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a09_6']	通色無邊，故等假也；	通色無邊，故等假也；	Universally revealing form is boundless, therefore equal to the provisional.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a10_1']	雖復無邊，而與心不相妨礙，中也。	雖復無邊，而與心不相妨礙，中也。	Although boundless, it does not obstruct the mind, the middle.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a11_7']	若據教道，止應齊此，而言無邊之法在一心中，則似妨詮旨。	若據教道，止應齊此，而言無邊之法在一心中，則似妨詮旨。	If based on the teaching path, it should only reach this point. Speaking of the boundless dharmas being in a single mind, it seems to obstruct the revealed purport.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a13_1']	今以二義通之，謂一約能造心是，不妨在心亦融，但所造法非，於色不可耳。	今以二義通之，謂一約能造心是，不妨在心亦融，但所造法非，於色不可耳。	Now, I explain it with two meanings: First, it is based on the mind that creates, and it does not hinder that which is in the mind being also fused, but the created dharmas are not, and it is not possible in form.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a14_14']	二約住果而不在因，如說八地入無功用道現十種身，是亦不妨教道之說。	二約住果而不在因，如說八地入無功用道現十種身，是亦不妨教道之說。	Second, it is based on abiding in the fruition and not in the cause, such as saying that the bodhisattva on the eighth ground enters the path of effortless activity and manifests ten kinds of bodies, and this does not hinder the teachings of the path of teaching.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a15_4']	「從於初地」下，帖釋。	「從於初地」下，帖釋。	From the first ground and below, it is a supplementary explanation.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a17_3']	言不動轉而能動轉者，即華嚴十地菩薩隨力隨分住十度中，其於事行無礙自在故也。	言不動轉而能動轉者，即華嚴十地菩薩隨力隨分住十度中，其於事行無礙自在故也。	It says without moving and yet able to move because the bodhisattva on the ten grounds of the Flower Ornament Sutra abides in the ten perfections according to their power and degree, and in their activities and practices there are no obstructions and they are free and at ease.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a17_10']	「六」字恐誤。	「六」字恐誤。	The character six is probably a mistake.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a17_16']	應作「十」。	應作「十」。	It should be ten.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a19_1']	「若觀」下，圓詮諸法本唯理性故無生滅，以圓見事理一念具足故。	「若觀」下，圓詮諸法本唯理性故無生滅，以圓見事理一念具足故。	Below if contemplating, the perfect interpretation of all dharmas is originally only the rational nature, so there is no arising or ceasing. Because the perfect view of phenomena and principles is complete in a single thought,
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a20_16']	雖無生滅而生滅宛然，失唯生滅宛然則約俗以名照，本無生滅則約真以言亡。	雖無生滅而生滅宛然，失唯生滅宛然則約俗以名照，本無生滅則約真以言亡。	although there is no arising or ceasing, arising and ceasing are still evident. If one loses the view of only arising and ceasing being evident, then it is named illumination based on the conventional. If one understands the original absence of arising and ceasing, then it is called forgetting based on the true.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a22_17']	是亦照真照俗以言照、遮真遮俗以言亡，則亡前遮照、照前遮照，亡照叵得而契乎中道。	是亦照真照俗以言照、遮真遮俗以言亡，則亡前遮照、照前遮照，亡照叵得而契乎中道。	This is also using illumination to illuminate the true and the conventional, and using negation to negate the true and the conventional. If one speaks of the negation of illumination and the illumination of negation, then the negation of illumination cannot be obtained, and one reaches the middle way.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a23_9']	三皆稱性，故廣大如法性；	三皆稱性，故廣大如法性；	The three are all in accordance with the nature, therefore vast like the Dharma-nature;
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a23_21']	三皆不動，故究竟若虛空。	三皆不動，故究竟若虛空。	The three are all unmoving, therefore ultimately like empty space.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a25_1']	「從初住」下，約分真究竟，帖釋住國稱王等義也。	「從初住」下，約分真究竟，帖釋住國稱王等義也。	From the initial abode and below, it is about the partial truth and ultimate truth, and it explains the meaning of being called a king who abides in the country, etc.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a26_2']	「又三藏」下，通約四教因果以判二字有得不得。	「又三藏」下，通約四教因果以判二字有得不得。	Furthermore, in the Tripiṭaka and below, it generally uses the causes and effects of the four teachings to distinguish whether the two characters are obtained or not.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a27_9']	則三藏四果以惑盡故得稱仁王，餘皆未得，合名王而不仁。	則三藏四果以惑盡故得稱仁王，餘皆未得，合名王而不仁。	Then, the four fruits in the Tripiṭaka are called benevolent kings because the delusions are exhausted, the others have not yet obtained it, and are collectively called kings but not benevolent.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a28_5']	通教以去並從果說，故通稱王亦可。	通教以去並從果說，故通稱王亦可。	The teachings from the Shared Teaching onwards are all spoken from the perspective of the fruit, therefore they are all called kings.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287a29_6']	三教止名小王，所謂二三小王各理蒼品是也。	三教止名小王，所謂二三小王各理蒼品是也。	The three teachings are only called minor kings, namely the two or three minor kings each governing a part of the people.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b02_11']	當教自有優劣者，謂各當其教相望言之，則仁王二字自為優劣，故曰非仁則王，即優劣可知云云。	當教自有優劣者，謂各當其教相望言之，則仁王二字自為優劣，故曰非仁則王，即優劣可知云云。	As for the teaching itself having superiority and inferiority, it means comparing them within their respective teachings. The two characters benevolence and king themselves have superiority and inferiority. Therefore, it is said that if one is not benevolent, one cannot be a king. The superiority and inferiority can be known, and so on.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b04_6']	又以世教言之，仁而不王者有之，未有不仁而王者也，不仁而王則桀紂是矣。	又以世教言之，仁而不王者有之，未有不仁而王者也，不仁而王則桀紂是矣。	Moreover, in terms of worldly teachings, there are those who are benevolent but not kings, but there are none who are not benevolent yet are kings. If one is not benevolent yet is a king, then Jie and Zhou are such examples.

['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b06_1']	謂久遠本迹則唯在《法華》，迹門尚非所聞，況餘部耶？	謂久遠本迹則唯在《法華》，迹門尚非所聞，況餘部耶？	As for the distant original and traces, it is only in the Lotus Sutra. The traces gate is not even heard of, let alone the other parts.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b06_14']	其餘迹中但得借用體用本迹。	其餘迹中但得借用體用本迹。	In the other traces, one can only borrow the use of the essence and function of the original and traces.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b08_10']	此復略開二義，謂一約偏圓本迹云云、二約分論淺深，則圓行為本、別果為迹。	此復略開二義，謂一約偏圓本迹云云、二約分論淺深，則圓行為本、別果為迹。	This is further briefly opened into two meanings: First, in terms of the original and traces of the biased and perfect, and so on. Second, in terms of the shallow and deep discussion of the parts, the perfect practice is the original, and the separate fruit is the traces.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b09_5']	通教佛地雖當果位，而望別成迹。	通教佛地雖當果位，而望別成迹。	Although the Buddha ground of the shared teaching is the position of the fruit, it is still the traces compared to the separate [vehicle].
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b10_6']	三藏二乘雖同小果，而望通屬末，末猶迹也。	三藏二乘雖同小果，而望通屬末，末猶迹也。	Although the Tripiṭaka and two vehicles have the same small fruit, compared to the through [vehicle] they belong to the end, where end means trace.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b10_17']	故知屈轉相望其義皆通。	故知屈轉相望其義皆通。	Therefore, know that the meaning of bending and turning each other is all inclusive.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b11_14']	或約當教自論，各有本迹，義不一揆。	或約當教自論，各有本迹，義不一揆。	Or, in terms of each teaching itself, each has its own root and trace, and the meaning is not the same.

['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b15_4']	四觀心釋者，於前三釋雖極圓妙，而望觀屬事，唯圓觀自行乃得其理，故曰譬如貧窮人日夜數他寶，為是故須觀心釋也。	四觀心釋者，於前三釋雖極圓妙，而望觀屬事，唯圓觀自行乃得其理，故曰譬如貧窮人日夜數他寶，為是故須觀心釋也。	As for the fourth, the explanation of contemplating the mind, although the previous three explanations are extremely perfect and wonderful, compared to contemplation they belong to phenomena. Only the perfect contemplation of one's own practice attains its principle, therefore it is said to be like a poor person counting others' treasures day and night. Therefore, one must explain the contemplation of the mind.

['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b18_9']	約四諦觀門，觀色空等境，隨教觀別，故曰觀生滅法，見色是有等，三藏觀也，謂生滅色由心所轉，故心得自在也。	約四諦觀門，觀色空等境，隨教觀別，故曰觀生滅法，見色是有等，三藏觀也，謂生滅色由心所轉，故心得自在也。	In terms of the four truths and contemplation gates, contemplating form, emptiness, etc., the contemplation is distinguished according to the teaching. Therefore, it is said to contemplate arising and ceasing dharmas, seeing form as existence, etc., is the Tripiṭaka contemplation. It means that arising and ceasing form is transformed by the mind, therefore the mind attains mastery.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b20_3']	觀色即是空等，通觀也，不唯心得自在，以即空故色亦自在，故曰空色自在。	觀色即是空等，通觀也，不唯心得自在，以即空故色亦自在，故曰空色自在。	Contemplating form as emptiness, etc. is comprehensive contemplation. Not only does the mind attain mastery, but because it is empty, form also attains mastery, thus it is called the mastery of empty form.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b20_18']	若觀空是色，次第而入，別觀也。	若觀空是色，次第而入，別觀也。	If one contemplates emptiness as form, entering in sequence, is separate contemplation.

['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b22_7']	若觀色空不二，圓觀也。	若觀色空不二，圓觀也。	If one contemplates form and emptiness as non-dual, is perfect contemplation.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b24_16']	惟其圓頓色空本唯一理，以約照邊不二而二，即照而亡二而不二，雙照雙亡只在一念，體即中道故無非實相。	惟其圓頓色空本唯一理，以約照邊不二而二，即照而亡二而不二，雙照雙亡只在一念，體即中道故無非實相。	Because the perfect and sudden form and emptiness are originally only one principle, from the perspective of illumination, it is non-dual yet dual. It is precisely in illumination that duality is forgotten, and non-duality is not dual. The double illumination and double forgetting are only in one thought. The essence is the middle way, therefore all are the true aspect.
['ZH_T33_1706_001:0287b27_8']	一心三觀、三觀一心，本無前後，是亦一心三觀故非縱、三觀一心故非橫，不縱不橫如天目等，自在之妙莫極於斯。	一心三觀、三觀一心，本無前後，是亦一心三觀故非縱、三觀一心故非橫，不縱不橫如天目等，自在之妙莫極於斯。	One mind and three contemplations, three contemplations and one mind, originally have no sequence. This is also because of the one mind and three contemplations, it is not sequential; because of the three contemplations and one mind, it is not lateral. Not sequential and not lateral, like the eyes of heaven, etc., the wondrous mastery does not reach its ultimate here.

Although it attains the provisional meaning of the Shared Teaching, it loses the true meaning of the Perfect and Sudden. If one loses the true meaning, then both the provisional and the true are not.

Therefore, even though it decreases from the beginning to a hundred years, they are generally able to give rise to the Buddha, and so the Buddha appears in their land.

This contrasts with those who have not yet destroyed evil and are therefore unable to give rise to the Buddha, which is the perfection of counteraction.
