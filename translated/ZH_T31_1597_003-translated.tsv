This defiled mental consciousness ceases in the intermediate existence, and in the mother's womb, the consciousness and kalala come together again.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0331c18_9']	若即意識與彼和合，既和合已依止此識於母胎中有意識轉。	若即意識與彼和合，既和合已依止此識於母胎中有意識轉。	If the mental consciousness itself comes together with it, and having come together, relies on this consciousness in the mother's womb, the mental consciousness turns.

['ZH_T31_1597_003:0331c23_13']	設和合識即是意識，為此和合意識即是一切種子識、為依止此識所生餘意識是一切種子識？	設和合識即是意識，為此和合意識即是一切種子識、為依止此識所生餘意識是一切種子識？	Even if the united consciousness is precisely mental consciousness, is this united mental consciousness precisely the consciousness that is the support of all seeds, or is the other mental consciousness that arises in dependence on this consciousness the one that is the support of all seeds?
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0331c25_4']	若此和合識是一切種子識，即是阿賴耶識，汝以異名立為意識。	若此和合識是一切種子識，即是阿賴耶識，汝以異名立為意識。	If this united consciousness is the consciousness that is the support of all seeds, it is precisely the store consciousness, and you establish it as mental consciousness by means of a different name.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0331c27_8']	若能依止識是一切種子識，是則所依因識非一切種子識，能依果識是一切種子識，不應道理。	若能依止識是一切種子識，是則所依因識非一切種子識，能依果識是一切種子識，不應道理。	If the consciousness that is the support is the consciousness that is the support of all seeds, then the consciousness that is the cause, i.e., the support, is not the consciousness that is the support of all seeds, and the consciousness that is the result, i.e., that which is supported, is the consciousness that is the support of all seeds. This is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0331c28_16']	是故成就此和合識非是意識，但是異熟識，是一切種子識。	是故成就此和合識非是意識，但是異熟識，是一切種子識。	Therefore, this united consciousness is not mental consciousness but is the consciousness that is retribution, which is the consciousness that is the support of all seeds.

This defiled mental consciousness has as its object the existence that is born and ceases in the intermediate state between death and rebirth.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a06_5']	言和合者，識與赤白同一安危，若和合識即是意識，依此復生所餘意識，是則一時二意識轉，謂所依止和合意識及能依止所餘意識。	言和合者，識與赤白同一安危，若和合識即是意識，依此復生所餘意識，是則一時二意識轉，謂所依止和合意識及能依止所餘意識。	The phrase “the union of the consciousness with the semen and blood” means that the consciousness and the semen and blood are in the same place and are not separated. If the united consciousness is the mental consciousness, then the remaining mental consciousnesses would arise supported by it. In that case, two mental consciousnesses would occur simultaneously, namely, the mental consciousness that is the support of the union and the mental consciousness that is supported by it.

['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a07_15']	依染污故、時無斷故。	依染污故、時無斷故。	Because it is defiled and because there is no interruption of the period of time.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a09_13']	謂此意識貪等煩惱所染污意為所依止，緣生有境故是染污，即此為依名依染污。	謂此意識貪等煩惱所染污意為所依止，緣生有境故是染污，即此為依名依染污。	This mental consciousness is defiled by the passions of craving, etc., and it is defiled because it is supported by the defiled manas and because it has as its object the existence that is born. It is defiled because it is supported by manas, and it is the support of the remaining mental consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a10_13']	於此位中所依異熟不容染污，是無記故。	於此位中所依異熟不容染污，是無記故。	In this state, the consciousness that is retribution of the fundamental consciousness is not defiled, because it is indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a11_8']	此和合識常無間斷，任業轉故。	此和合識常無間斷，任業轉故。	This consciousness of synthesis is always without interruption, because it is the evolving consciousness that is the support of karmic predispositions.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a12_15']	意識所緣不可得故者，意識所緣明了可得，所謂諸法。	意識所緣不可得故者，意識所緣明了可得，所謂諸法。	Because the objects of the mental consciousness cannot be found, the objects of the mental consciousness are clearly found, that is, all dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a14_4']	此和合識無有如是明了所緣，是故此識是意識性，不應道理。	此和合識無有如是明了所緣，是故此識是意識性，不應道理。	This consciousness of synthesis does not have such a clearly evident object, and therefore it is not reasonable that this consciousness is the nature of mental consciousness.

['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a21_1']	不堅住故者，謂餘六識各別處故、易動轉故。	不堅住故者，謂餘六識各別處故、易動轉故。	Because they are not firmly abiding means that the remaining six consciousnesses are in separate locations and are easily moved and transformed.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332a22_10']	且如眼識眼為別依，如是其餘耳等諸識，耳等色根為各別依。	且如眼識眼為別依，如是其餘耳等諸識，耳等色根為各別依。	For example, visual consciousness has the eye as its special support. In the same way, the other consciousnesses, such as auditory consciousness, have the material organs such as the ears as their special supports.

If they were apart from the ālaya consciousness, the organs such as the eyes would not be able to appropriate them as support and would then decay and perish.

['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332b14_1']	意思食者，是能悕望，由希望故饒益所依，如遠見水雖渴不死。	意思食者，是能悕望，由希望故饒益所依，如遠見水雖渴不死。	The food of volition is that which is able to hope for, because by hoping for it benefits the support. For example, although one sees water in the distance, one does not die of thirst.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332b15_13']	識食者，是能執受，由執受故所依久住，若不爾者，應同死屍不久爛壞。	識食者，是能執受，由執受故所依久住，若不爾者，應同死屍不久爛壞。	The food of consciousness is that which is able to grasp and hold, because by grasping and holding the support remains for a long time. If it were not so, then it would quickly rot and decay like a corpse.
['ZH_T31_1597_003:0332b16_13']	是故應許識亦是食，能作所依饒益事故。	是故應許識亦是食，能作所依饒益事故。	Therefore, it must be admitted that consciousness is also food, because it is able to act as a support and benefit.

In the concentrated stages, the continuation of rebirth is due to the non-concentrated defiled mental consciousness.🔽As for the defiled, it is defiled by the passions of that stage.

It is because of this mind that there is rebirth and the continuity of consciousness.
