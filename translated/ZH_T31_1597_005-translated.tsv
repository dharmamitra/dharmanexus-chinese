['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343a29_13']	成稱體多體，　　雜體相違故。	成稱體多體，　　雜體相違故。	005	There is contradiction in the establishment of the correspondence of essence, multiplicity of essences, and mixture of essences.

['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b04_8']	如依他起自性，遍計所執分雖顯現可得，而非稱彼體。	如依他起自性，遍計所執分雖顯現可得，而非稱彼體。	005	Although the imagined aspect of the dependent nature appears and can be obtained, it does not correspond to its essence.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b05_9']	為顯此義故，說由名前覺無稱體相違故等。	為顯此義故，說由名前覺無稱體相違故等。	005	In order to illustrate this meaning, it is said that the cognition before the name contradicts the essence of the name.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b06_14']	若依他起、遍計所執同一相者，應不待名，於義覺轉。	若依他起、遍計所執同一相者，應不待名，於義覺轉。	005	If the dependent and the imagined have the same characteristic, then the cognition of the object should occur without depending on the name.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b07_15']	如執有瓶，若離瓶名，於瓶義中無有瓶覺。	如執有瓶，若離瓶名，於瓶義中無有瓶覺。	005	Just as when grasping the existence of a pot, if one is apart from the name of the pot, there is no cognition of the pot in regard to the meaning of the pot.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b08_14']	若此瓶名與彼瓶義同一相者，瓶覺應轉；	若此瓶名與彼瓶義同一相者，瓶覺應轉；	005	If this name of the pot and that meaning of the pot have the same characteristic, then the cognition of the pot should occur;
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b09_5']	以非一相是故不轉。	以非一相是故不轉。	005	but because they do not have the same characteristic, it does not occur.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b11_13']	由此名義，若體相稱則成相違，此中安立名為依他起、義為遍計所執，以依他起由名勢力成所遍計故。	由此名義，若體相稱則成相違，此中安立名為依他起、義為遍計所執，以依他起由名勢力成所遍計故。	005	By this, if the name and meaning have the same essence, then it becomes contradictory. Here, the name is established as the dependent and the meaning as the imagined, because the dependent is imagined by the power of the name.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b13_5']	又於一義有眾多名，若名與義同一相者，義應如名亦有多種。	又於一義有眾多名，若名與義同一相者，義應如名亦有多種。	005	Moreover, there are many names for one meaning. If the name and meaning have the same characteristic, then the meaning should be like the name and also have many kinds.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b14_5']	若爾，此義應成多體，一義多體則成相違。	若爾，此義應成多體，一義多體則成相違。	005	If so, then this meaning should become multiple entities. One meaning and multiple entities then become contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b15_4']	是故兩性若同一相，則成第二相違過失。	是故兩性若同一相，則成第二相違過失。	005	Therefore, if the two natures have the same characteristic, it becomes the second fault of contradiction.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b16_1']	又名不決定，以一瞿聲於九義轉。	又名不決定，以一瞿聲於九義轉。	005	Moreover, names are indeterminate, because the one sound go occurs with nine meanings.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b17_10']	若執名義同一相者，多義相違應同一體，則成第三相違過失。	若執名義同一相者，多義相違應同一體，則成第三相違過失。	005	If one grasps that names and meanings have the same characteristic, then many meanings contradicting each other should have the same essence, which becomes the third fault of contradiction.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b18_15']	由執牛等非一相義，同一性故，初一伽他重顯此義。	由執牛等非一相義，同一性故，初一伽他重顯此義。	005	Because one grasps that the meanings of cow, etc. are not of the same characteristic, but of the same nature, the first verse reiterates this meaning.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b19_15']	於中成者，顯依他起、遍計所執非一義成。	於中成者，顯依他起、遍計所執非一義成。	005	Among them, established shows that the other-dependent and the imagined are not established as having the same meaning.

['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b26_12']	似虛空者，譬如虛空雖非雲等所能染污，性清淨故，而離彼時說名清淨。	似虛空者，譬如虛空雖非雲等所能染污，性清淨故，而離彼時說名清淨。	005	As for being like space, it is like how space, although not defiled by clouds and so forth because its nature is pure, is said to be pure when separated from them.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343b28_7']	當知諸法亦復如是，雖實無染，性清淨故，然客障垢得滅離時說名清淨。	當知諸法亦復如是，雖實無染，性清淨故，然客障垢得滅離時說名清淨。	005	One should understand that dharmas are also like this. Although they are not really defiled because their nature is pure, when the adventitious defilements are extinguished and eliminated, they are said to be pure.

['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343c04_6']	若依他起及圓成實自性無有，應成無有染淨過失。	若依他起及圓成實自性無有，應成無有染淨過失。	005	If the dependent nature and the perfected nature did not exist, there would be the error of no defilement and purity.
['ZH_T31_1597_005:0343c05_6']	既現可得雜染清淨，是故不應一切皆無。	既現可得雜染清淨，是故不應一切皆無。	005	Since defilement and purity are presently obtained, therefore everything should not be nonexistent.
