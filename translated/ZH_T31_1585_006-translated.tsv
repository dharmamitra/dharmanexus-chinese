['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b22_1']	唯善心俱，名善心所，謂信慚等定有十一。	唯善心俱，名善心所，謂信慚等定有十一。	Only those that accompany wholesome minds are called wholesome mental factors, namely faith, conscience, etc., which definitely number eleven.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b22_6']	云何為信？	云何為信？	What is faith?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b23_10']	於實德能深忍樂欲心淨為性，對治不信樂善為業。	於實德能深忍樂欲心淨為性，對治不信樂善為業。	Its nature is that of mental purity consisting of deep conviction and delight in realities, virtues, and abilities, and its activity is that of countering faithlessness and delighting in the good.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b24_1']	然信差別略有三種：	然信差別略有三種：	However, faith is differentiated in three ways:
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b25_1']	一信實有，謂於諸法實事理中深信忍故；	一信實有，謂於諸法實事理中深信忍故；	First, faith in what really exists, which means deeply believing and accepting the realities and principles of all dharmas;
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b26_1']	二信有德，謂於三寶真淨德中深信樂故；	二信有德，謂於三寶真淨德中深信樂故；	Second, faith in what has virtues, which means deeply believing and delighting in the true and pure virtues of the Three Jewels;
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b27_9']	三信有能，謂於一切世出世善深信有力能得能成起希望故。	三信有能，謂於一切世出世善深信有力能得能成起希望故。	The third is the belief in the power of the mind, that is, the deep belief that all mundane and supramundane good has the power to be obtained and accomplished, and the arising of hope.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b28_11']	由斯對治彼不信心，愛樂證修世出世善。	由斯對治彼不信心，愛樂證修世出世善。	This, as an antidote, opposes the lack of faith in the mind and delights in the realization and cultivation of mundane and supramundane good.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b29_2']	忍謂勝解，此即信因。	忍謂勝解，此即信因。	Forbearance is a kind of resolve, and this is the cause of faith.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029b29_12']	樂欲謂欲，即是信果。	樂欲謂欲，即是信果。	Desire is will, and this is the result of faith.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c01_2']	礭陳此信自相是何？	礭陳此信自相是何？	What is the specific characteristic of this faith?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c01_11']	豈不適言心淨為性。	豈不適言心淨為性。	Isn’t it said that its nature is that of a purity of mind?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c03_2']	此猶未了彼心淨言，若淨即心應非心所，若令心淨慚等何別？	此猶未了彼心淨言，若淨即心應非心所，若令心淨慚等何別？	This is still not clear. If purity is the mind, it should not be a mental activity. If it is said to purify the mind, how does it differ from conscience?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c03_12']	心俱淨法，為難亦然。	心俱淨法，為難亦然。	The same difficulty arises if it is said to be a pure dharma associated with the mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c05_1']	此性澄清能淨心等，以心勝故立心淨名，如水清珠能清濁水。	此性澄清能淨心等，以心勝故立心淨名，如水清珠能清濁水。	Its nature is that of clarity and purity, and it can purify the mind and other dharmas. Because the mind is preeminent, it is said that the mind is purified, just as a water-purifying jewel can purify turbid water.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c06_1']	慚等雖善，非淨為相，此淨為相無濫彼失。	慚等雖善，非淨為相，此淨為相無濫彼失。	Even though conscience, etc., are good, their characteristics are not purity. If faith is characterized by purity, there is no error of confusion with conscience, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c08_1']	又諸染法各別有相，唯有不信自相渾濁，復能渾濁餘心心所，如極穢物自穢穢他。	又諸染法各別有相，唯有不信自相渾濁，復能渾濁餘心心所，如極穢物自穢穢他。	Moreover, each defiled dharma has its own characteristics. Only nonfaith has the characteristic of turbidity and is able to make other minds and mental activities turbid, just as an extremely filthy thing is itself filthy and makes other things filthy.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c08_11']	信正翻彼，故淨為相。	信正翻彼，故淨為相。	Faith is the opposite of that, and therefore its characteristic is purity.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c10_2']	有說信者愛樂為相，應通三性，體應即欲，又應苦集非信所緣。	有說信者愛樂為相，應通三性，體應即欲，又應苦集非信所緣。	Some say that faith has the characteristic of delight, but it should be common to all three natures, its substance should be the same as desire, and it should not have the truth of suffering and the truth of the cause of suffering as objects.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c13_2']	有執信者隨順為相，應通三性，即勝解欲，若印順者即勝解故，若樂順者即是欲故，離彼二體無順相故，由此應知心淨是信。	有執信者隨順為相，應通三性，即勝解欲，若印順者即勝解故，若樂順者即是欲故，離彼二體無順相故，由此應知心淨是信。	Some hold that faith has the characteristic of conformity, but it should be common to all three natures, and it should be the same as resolve and desire. If it is the conformity of conviction, it is resolve, and if it is the conformity of pleasure, it is desire. Apart from those two natures, there is no characteristic of conformity. Consequently, you should understand that purity of mind is faith.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c13_7']	云何為慚？	云何為慚？	What is APTRPA?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c14_12']	依自法力崇重賢善為性，對治無慚止息惡行為業。	依自法力崇重賢善為性，對治無慚止息惡行為業。	Its nature is that of venerating the good and respecting the virtuous on the basis of oneself and the Dharma, and its activity is that of countering shamelessness and putting a stop to evil actions.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c16_4']	謂依自法尊貴增上，崇重賢善羞恥過惡，對治無慚息諸惡行。	謂依自法尊貴增上，崇重賢善羞恥過惡，對治無慚息諸惡行。	That is, on the basis of the supremacy of oneself and the Dharma, one venerates the good and respects the virtuous, and is ashamed of and detests evil. It counters shamelessness and puts a stop to evil actions.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c16_9']	云何為愧？	云何為愧？	What is OBTRPA?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c17_13']	依世間力輕拒暴惡為性，對治無愧止息惡行為業。	依世間力輕拒暴惡為性，對治無愧止息惡行為業。	Its nature is that of despising and resisting evil on the strength of worldly opinion. Its activity is that of countering shamelessness and putting a stop to evil conduct.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c19_5']	謂依世間訶厭增上，輕拒暴惡羞恥過罪，對治無愧息諸惡業。	謂依世間訶厭增上，輕拒暴惡羞恥過罪，對治無愧息諸惡業。	That is, on the strength of worldly censure and disgust, one despises and resists evil and is ashamed of faults and offenses, one counters shamelessness and puts a stop to evil conduct.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c20_5']	羞恥過惡是二通相，故諸聖教假說為體。	羞恥過惡是二通相，故諸聖教假說為體。	Shame at faults and offenses is the common characteristic of both. Therefore holy teachings say that it is the essence of both.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c22_5']	若執羞恥為二別相，應慚與愧體無差別，則此二法定不相應，非受想等有此義故。	若執羞恥為二別相，應慚與愧體無差別，則此二法定不相應，非受想等有此義故。	If you insist that shame is the specific characteristic of both, then the substance of conscience and sense of shame would be no different, and these two dharmas would definitely not be associated, because feeling, conceptualization, etc., do not have this meaning.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c23_7']	若待自他立二別者，應非實有，便違聖教。	若待自他立二別者，應非實有，便違聖教。	If you establish the difference between the two on the basis of self and others, then they would not really exist, and this contradicts holy teachings.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c24_6']	若許慚愧實而別起，復違論說十遍善心。	若許慚愧實而別起，復違論說十遍善心。	If you admit that conscience and sense of shame really exist and arise separately, then this contradicts the Yogācārabhūmi which says that ten dharmas are found in all good minds.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c25_5']	崇重輕拒若二別相，所緣有異應不俱生。	崇重輕拒若二別相，所緣有異應不俱生。	If the specific characteristics of the two are respect and contempt, then they must have different objects and therefore not occur together.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c25_15']	二失既同，何乃偏責？	二失既同，何乃偏責？	Since both are equally subject to these two errors, why do you single out the second?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c26_5']	誰言二法所緣有異？	誰言二法所緣有異？	Who says that the objects of the two dharmas are different?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c26_10']	不爾如何？	不爾如何？	If not, how can it be said that they have different objects?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c28_7']	善心起時隨緣何境，皆有崇重善及輕拒惡義，故慚與愧俱遍善心所緣無別。	善心起時隨緣何境，皆有崇重善及輕拒惡義，故慚與愧俱遍善心所緣無別。	When a good mind occurs, regardless of the object, there is respect for good and rejection of evil, and therefore shame and conscience are found in all good minds and have no separate objects.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c28_16']	豈不我說亦有此義？	豈不我說亦有此義？	Don’t we also have this interpretation?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0029c29_16']	汝執慚愧自相既同，何理能遮前所設難？	汝執慚愧自相既同，何理能遮前所設難？	If you insist that the specific characteristics of shame and conscience are the same, what reason do you have to refute the objections raised above?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a02_16']	然聖教說顧自他者，自法名自、世間名他，或即此中崇拒善惡於己益損名自他故。	然聖教說顧自他者，自法名自、世間名他，或即此中崇拒善惡於己益損名自他故。	However, when the holy teachings say that one is concerned with oneself and others, one’s own Dharma is called oneself, and the world is called others, or one is concerned with oneself and others because one respects and rejects good and evil and benefits and injures oneself.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a04_8']	無貪等者等無瞋癡，此三名根，生善勝故，三不善根近對治故。	無貪等者等無瞋癡，此三名根，生善勝故，三不善根近對治故。	Noncovetousness, etc., means noncovetousness, nonhatred, and nondelusion. These three are called roots because they are superior in generating good and because they are direct antidotes to the three unwholesome roots.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a04_13']	云何無貪？	云何無貪？	What is noncovetousness?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a05_12']	於有有具無著為性，對治貪著作善為業。	於有有具無著為性，對治貪著作善為業。	Its nature is that of nonattachment to existence and the causes of existence. Its activity is that of countering covetousness and promoting good.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a05_17']	云何無瞋？	云何無瞋？	What is nonhatred?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a07_1']	於苦苦具無恚為性，對治瞋恚作善為業。	於苦苦具無恚為性，對治瞋恚作善為業。	Its nature is that of nonaversion to suffering and the causes of suffering. Its activity is that of countering hatred and promoting good.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a08_1']	善心起時隨緣何境，皆於有等無著無恚。	善心起時隨緣何境，皆於有等無著無恚。	When a good mind occurs, regardless of the object, there is nonattachment to existence, etc., and nonaversion.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a09_11']	觀有等立，非要緣彼，如前慚愧觀善惡立，故此二種俱遍善心。	觀有等立，非要緣彼，如前慚愧觀善惡立，故此二種俱遍善心。	The two dharmas of shame and compunction are established on the basis of observing good and evil, as was explained earlier, and therefore these two are found in all good minds.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a09_16']	云何無癡？	云何無癡？	What is nondelusion?
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a10_15']	於諸理事明解為性，對治愚癡作善為業。	於諸理事明解為性，對治愚癡作善為業。	Its nature is that of clear understanding of things and events, and its activity is that of counteracting delusion and promoting good actions.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a12_19']	有義，無癡即慧為性，《集論》說此報教證智決擇為體，生得聞思修所生慧，如次皆是決擇性故。	有義，無癡即慧為性，《集論》說此報教證智決擇為體，生得聞思修所生慧，如次皆是決擇性故。	There is an interpretation that nondelusion is by nature discernment, because the Abhidharmasamuccaya says that it is the discernment of retribution, teaching, and realization. The discernment that is innate, that which is born of listening, reflection, and cultivation, is, respectively, discernment by retribution, teaching, and realization.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a14_4']	此雖即慧，為顯善品有勝功能，如煩惱見故復別說。	此雖即慧，為顯善品有勝功能，如煩惱見故復別說。	Although it is discernment, it is again separately mentioned in order to show that it has a superior function in the class of good dharmas, just as the defilement of views is.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a15_13']	有義，無癡非即是慧，別有自性正對無明，如無貪瞋，善根攝故。	有義，無癡非即是慧，別有自性正對無明，如無貪瞋，善根攝故。	According to another interpretation, nondelusion is not discernment by nature, but has a separate substance, because it directly opposes delusion, just as noncraving and nonhatred do.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a16_8']	論說大悲，無瞋癡攝，非根攝故。	論說大悲，無瞋癡攝，非根攝故。	The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that great compassion is categorized as nonhatred and nondelusion, but is not categorized as a faculty, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a17_10']	若彼無癡以慧為性，大悲如力等，應慧等根攝。	若彼無癡以慧為性，大悲如力等，應慧等根攝。	If nondelusion is by nature discernment, then great compassion, like the powers, etc., would be categorized as a faculty, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a19_9']	又若無癡無別自性，如不害等應非實物，便違論說十一善中三世俗有餘皆是實。	又若無癡無別自性，如不害等應非實物，便違論說十一善中三世俗有餘皆是實。	Also, if nondelusion has no separate substance of its own, like nonharming, etc., it should not be a real entity, and this contradicts the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra, which says that among the eleven good dharmas, three are conventionally real and the rest are real.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a20_17']	然《集論》說慧為體者，舉彼因果顯此自性，如以忍樂表信自體。	然《集論》說慧為體者，舉彼因果顯此自性，如以忍樂表信自體。	However, the Abhidharmasamuccaya says that nondelusion has wisdom as its substance. This is done to reveal its cause and effect and to show its own nature, just as faith is revealed by patience and joy.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a21_4']	理必應爾。	理必應爾。	This must be the correct principle.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a22_8']	以貪瞋癡六識相應，正煩惱攝，起惡勝故，立不善根。	以貪瞋癡六識相應，正煩惱攝，起惡勝故，立不善根。	Because craving, hatred, and delusion are associated with the six consciousnesses, are categorized as real passions, and are the most powerful in generating evil, they are established as the roots of nongood.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a23_17', 'ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a25_7']	斷彼必由通別對治，通唯善慧，別即三根，由此無癡必應別有。🔽勤謂精進，於善惡品修斷事中勇悍為性，對治懈怠滿善為業。	斷彼必由通別對治，通唯善慧，別即三根，由此無癡必應別有。 勤謂精進，於善惡品修斷事中勇悍為性，對治懈怠滿善為業。	One must definitely rely on both general and specific antidotes to eliminate them. The general antidote is good discernment, and the specific antidotes are the three roots. Consequently, nondelusion must be a separate entity.🔽Vigor is zeal. Its nature is that of bravery in the cultivation and elimination of good and evil things. Its activity is that of counteracting indolence and fulfilling the good.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a26_17']	勇表勝進簡諸染法，悍表精純簡淨無記，即顯精進唯善性攝。	勇表勝進簡諸染法，悍表精純簡淨無記，即顯精進唯善性攝。	Bravery reveals the excellence of vigor and distinguishes it from defiled dharmas. Bravery reveals the purity of vigor and distinguishes it from pure, indeterminate dharmas. This shows that vigor is categorized as only good by nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030a29_7']	此相差別略有五種，所謂被甲、加行、無下、無退、無足，即經所說有勢、有勤、有勇、堅猛、不捨善軛，如次應知。	此相差別略有五種，所謂被甲、加行、無下、無退、無足，即經所說有勢、有勤、有勇、堅猛、不捨善軛，如次應知。	There are five kinds of characteristics of vigor: donning armor, performance, nonregression, nonretrogression, and nonself-satisfaction. These are the vigor with power, effort, courage, resoluteness, and nonabandonment of the yoke of the good law mentioned in the scriptures. You should understand that they correspond to the above five kinds.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b01_11']	此五別者，謂初發心自分勝進，自分行中三品別故；	此五別者，謂初發心自分勝進，自分行中三品別故；	The five are distinguished as follows: the first is the initial resolve, the second is the superior progress of the resolve, and the third is the three grades of practice of the resolve.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b02_9']	或初發心長時無間慇重無餘修差別故；	或初發心長時無間慇重無餘修差別故；	Or, the first is the initial resolve, and the other four are the differences of the four kinds of practice—long-term, uninterrupted, earnest, and complete.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b03_10']	或資糧等五道別故，二乘究竟道欣大菩提故；	或資糧等五道別故，二乘究竟道欣大菩提故；	Or, they are the differences of the five paths of equipment, etc., because the ultimate path of the two vehicles is the delight in great enlightenment.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b04_4']	諸佛究竟道樂利樂他故；	諸佛究竟道樂利樂他故；	The ultimate path of all buddhas is the delight in benefiting and gladdening others.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b04_17']	或二加行無間解脫勝進別故。	或二加行無間解脫勝進別故。	Or, the first two are the paths of added effort, the third is the uninterrupted path, the fourth is the path of liberation, and the fifth is the path of progress.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b06_8']	安謂輕安，遠離麁重調暢身心堪任為性，對治惛沈轉依為業。	安謂輕安，遠離麁重調暢身心堪任為性，對治惛沈轉依為業。	Tranquility is the same as serenity. Its nature is that of freedom from grossness, a sense of comfort in body and mind, and fitness. Its activity is that of countering torpor and transforming the basis.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b07_8']	謂此伏除能障定法，令所依止轉安適故。	謂此伏除能障定法，令所依止轉安適故。	That is, it subdues and removes the dharmas that obstruct samādhi and causes the basis to become comfortable and fit.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b09_8']	不放逸者，精進三根於所斷修防修為性，對治放逸、成滿一切世出世間善事為業。	不放逸者，精進三根於所斷修防修為性，對治放逸、成滿一切世出世間善事為業。	Nonnegligence is by nature the three roots of good, plus effort, in the task of preventing and cultivating. Its activity is that of countering negligence and perfecting all mundane and supramundane good things.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b12_1']	謂即四法於斷修事皆能防修名不放逸，非別有體，無異相故，於防惡事修善事中離四功能無別用故。	謂即四法於斷修事皆能防修名不放逸，非別有體，無異相故，於防惡事修善事中離四功能無別用故。	That is, the four dharmas of faith, conscience, etc., in the task of preventing evil and cultivating good are called nonnegligence. It does not have a separate substance, because it has no characteristics different from the four dharmas, and because apart from the four powers of preventing evil and cultivating good, it has no function of its own.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b13_10']	雖信慚等亦有此能，而方彼四勢用微劣，非根遍策故非此依。	雖信慚等亦有此能，而方彼四勢用微劣，非根遍策故非此依。	Even though faith, conscience, etc., also have this power, in comparison with the four dharmas, their power is weak, they are not roots, and they do not universally stimulate. Therefore they are not the support of nonnegligence.
['ZH_T31_1585_006:0030b14_10']	豈不防修是此相用，防修何異精進三根？	豈不防修是此相用，防修何異精進三根？	Is not the characteristic and function of nonnegligence to prevent evil and cultivate good? How does it differ from effort and the three roots?
