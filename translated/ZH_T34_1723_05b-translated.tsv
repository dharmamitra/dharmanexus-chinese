Therefore, wrong views are taken as equal. These extreme and wrong views encompass the 62 views held by non-Buddhists. Now, it is shown that based on words, one abandons wrong views and returns to the correct. Therefore, this is stated in particular.

These people have used the Buddha's words to eliminate the causes of suffering, such as the view of self, and are certain that future suffering will not arise again.

They each are unable to know that they will attain Buddhahood, and do not know what Dharma they have already realized and attained.

It is as the chapter on expedient means says: Knowing that sentient beings have various desires, according to their fundamental natures, using various expedient means to expound the Dharma for them. All of this is for the sake of attaining the One Buddha Vehicle and omniscience. This is precisely the explanation of the provisional in the past and the explanation of the true in the present. The reason for being like this is to transform the bodhisattvas. Because of this, it is called the reason for the explanation.

The transformation Buddha only rules the three thousand worlds. The country is large and wide, a metaphor for the great chiliocosm. The town is next, a metaphor for the medium chiliocosm.

Although the suffering of birth and death is painful, they still have no intention of detesting birth and death and do not seek to leave the world or realize nirvana. Therefore, the previous chapter says, They do not seek the Buddha with great power and the Dharma to end suffering. Such sentient beings are deeply pitiable.

The characteristic of the unconditioned virtue is one and general, so it only speaks of the transformed city.

['ZH_T34_1723_05b:0748c24_7']	行能即是斷惑等用智力功能。	行能即是斷惑等用智力功能。	The ability to practice is the function of the power of wisdom in cutting off delusions and so on.

['ZH_T34_1723_05b:0749a09_7']	彼所證得世間禪定，虛指為車名得出門，為漸入大乘因證大涅槃位。	彼所證得世間禪定，虛指為車名得出門，為漸入大乘因證大涅槃位。	The worldly dhyāna and samādhi that they realize is provisionally pointed to as a vehicle, called leaving the gate, in order to gradually enter the cause of the Great Vehicle and realize the stage of great nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T34_1723_05b:0749a12_3']	故本論云「第一人者，以世間種種善根三昧功德方便令戲，後令入涅槃」，故三乘之教合名為門，理出教外故名門外。	故本論云「第一人者，以世間種種善根三昧功德方便令戲，後令入涅槃」，故三乘之教合名為門，理出教外故名門外。	Therefore the original treatise says, The first person uses various worldly good roots, samādhi merits, and skillful means to amuse them, and later causes them to enter nirvāṇa. Therefore the teachings of the three vehicles are collectively called the gate, and the principle is outside the teachings, so it is called outside the gate.
['ZH_T34_1723_05b:0749a15_3']	又此門者三乘因行，果出因中故言門外，此中定取分別種智以為車體，故經數言「究竟令得一切種智」，亦乘亦大名大乘義。	又此門者三乘因行，果出因中故言門外，此中定取分別種智以為車體，故經數言「究竟令得一切種智」，亦乘亦大名大乘義。	Moreover, this gate is the causal practices of the three vehicles, and the fruition emerges from within the causes, so it is said to be outside the gate. In this context, it definitely takes the wisdom of discrimination as the essence of the vehicle, so the sūtra repeatedly says, Ultimately causing them to attain omniscience. It is both a vehicle and great, so it is called the meaning of the Great Vehicle.

The middling type, upon hearing once, gradually knows the expedient and real, and although they discern what to accept and reject, they still do not know the causes for acceptance. Therefore, the three vehicles are taught to make them recognize the practices of the One Vehicle. The enlightenment and quiescence within the fruits are concealed, and the wisdom vehicle within the causes is spoken of. The principle vehicle within the causes is hidden, and the cultivation of the various knowledges is eliminated. Because the principles are gradually understood, and because the wisdom is not yet familiar.

Again, it is revealed that the principles have the provisional and the true. The basis is taught to make them accept and reject. The wisdom categories within the fruits are concealed, and the double adornment within the causes is hidden. The responses to the capacities are not the same, and the three parts differ slightly. This is because the causes and fruits of the One Vehicle are spoken of in a biased and complete way, and because the enlightenment and quiescence within the fruits are shown as perfect and incomplete.

['ZH_T34_1723_05b:0749b20_10']	今以所斷障同、生空理同、假擇滅同，由此三義同故化城名一。	今以所斷障同、生空理同、假擇滅同，由此三義同故化城名一。	Now, because the same obstacles are eliminated, the same principle of emptiness of beings is realized, and the same provisional cessation through discrimination is attained, for these three reasons they are the same, therefore the illusory cities are said to be one.

Horses are like the swift and outstanding Mahayana, not comparable to the slowness of the small vehicle's donkey cart. Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says drawn by horses. Elephants are used because their physical virtues are great, unlike the smaller physical virtues of cows, deer, and sheep.
