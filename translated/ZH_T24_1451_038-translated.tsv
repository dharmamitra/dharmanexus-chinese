At that time, there was a non-Buddhist ascetic named Subhadra in the city of Kuśinagara, who was 120 years old and had a decrepit appearance.

When he was first born, the flowers gradually had some color. When he was a child, the flowers were about to bloom. Disgusted by old age, sickness, and death, he left for the mountains and forests, and the flowers grew larger, shaped like a crow's beak. When he practiced austerities, the flowers withered and drooped. After abandoning austerities, his breath became smooth and he ate various foods, as explained above. Finally, when he attained perfect enlightenment, the flowers opened.

He then went to Kuśinagara to lie down for the last time, and the shape and color of the flowers on the tree withered and drooped, causing those who saw it to be shocked and amazed.
