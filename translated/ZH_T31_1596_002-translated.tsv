['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276a17_4']	於中因相者，是諸染法，此阿梨耶識如彼一切種子，一切時現起為因故。	於中因相者，是諸染法，此阿梨耶識如彼一切種子，一切時現起為因故。	002	Among them, the causal nature refers to all defiled dharmas, as this ālaya consciousness is the cause for the arising of all seeds at all times.

Since its characteristics are not yet known in these different explanations, the characteristics of the ālaya consciousness itself, its causal characteristics, its resultant characteristics, and so forth are explained.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276a22_12']	於中自相者，一切染法熏習緣故，識有生彼功能勝異，顯示識體有此功能故。	於中自相者，一切染法熏習緣故，識有生彼功能勝異，顯示識體有此功能故。	002	Among them, the characteristic of the ālaya consciousness itself is that it is the condition for the perfuming of all defiled dharmas, and the consciousness has the superior power to produce them. This shows that the essence of the consciousness has this power.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276a24_5']	攝持種子相應者，彼一切染法熏習已，即為彼法生因，故言攝持種子。	攝持種子相應者，彼一切染法熏習已，即為彼法生因，故言攝持種子。	002	The characteristic of holding seeds in association means that after being perfumed by all defiled dharmas, it becomes the cause for the production of those dharmas, and is therefore said to hold seeds.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276a25_17']	彼熏習與彼勝能合故名相應，即此自相一切染法熏習已，為彼得生因。	彼熏習與彼勝能合故名相應，即此自相一切染法熏習已，為彼得生因。	002	Because those perfuming activities are combined with that superior power, it is called association. This characteristic of the ālaya consciousness itself, after being perfumed by all defiled dharmas, becomes the cause for their production.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276a27_5']	攝持種子相應識，為諸染法熏習已得勝功能，能為彼生因。	攝持種子相應識，為諸染法熏習已得勝功能，能為彼生因。	002	The consciousness that holds seeds in association becomes the cause for the production of those defiled dharmas after being perfumed by them and acquiring superior power.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276a27_14']	此是阿梨耶識因相。	此是阿梨耶識因相。	002	This is the causal characteristic of the ālaya consciousness.

['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b06_14']	譬如胡麻以華熏之，胡麻與華同生同滅，以胡麻中有彼華香生因故能生香。	譬如胡麻以華熏之，胡麻與華同生同滅，以胡麻中有彼華香生因故能生香。	002	It is like sesame being perfumed by flowers. The sesame is born together with and ceases together with the flowers. Because there is the cause for the birth of the fragrance of those flowers in the sesame, it can produce fragrance.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b08_2']	又如欲等行熏習，欲等與心同生同滅已，後為欲等生因。	又如欲等行熏習，欲等與心同生同滅已，後為欲等生因。	002	It is also like the perfuming of desire and so forth. Desire and so forth are born together with and cease together with the mind, and then become the cause for the birth of desire and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b10_5']	又如多聞，有多聞熏習思念所聞與心同生同滅已，為彼記錄生因，由攝持熏習故說名持法者。	又如多聞，有多聞熏習思念所聞與心同生同滅已，為彼記錄生因，由攝持熏習故說名持法者。	002	It is also like the case of one who has heard much, whose mind is born and perishes together with the mind that thinks about what has been heard, and which has already become the cause for the arising of that [mind], because it is the cause for the arising of that [mind]. Due to the perfuming of grasping and holding, it is called one who upholds the Dharma.

['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b11_11']	彼法者，即前染法。	彼法者，即前染法。	002	The Dharma refers to the previously mentioned defiled dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b12_13']	同生同滅已後為彼生因者，謂還與彼染法為因體。	同生同滅已後為彼生因者，謂還與彼染法為因體。	002	Having been born and perished together, it later becomes the cause for their arising means that it again becomes the essence of the cause for those defiled dharmas.

['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b17_9']	無別物體於識中住，亦非不異，然阿梨耶識如此而生，有勝功能能生彼法，說名一切種子識。	無別物體於識中住，亦非不異，然阿梨耶識如此而生，有勝功能能生彼法，說名一切種子識。	002	There is no separate substance that abides in the consciousness, nor is it not different. However, the ālaya consciousness arises in this way, having a superior ability to give rise to those dharmas, and is called the consciousness with all seeds.

['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b21_5']	又阿梨耶識剎那滅義不成，由分分差別故。	又阿梨耶識剎那滅義不成，由分分差別故。	002	Moreover, the meaning of the momentary cessation of the ālaya consciousness would not be established, because of the distinctions.
['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276b22_9']	又善惡法所熏習，即成善惡種子體，然此是無記故。	又善惡法所熏習，即成善惡種子體，然此是無記故。	002	Moreover, the perfuming of good and evil dharmas would immediately become the substance of good and evil seeds, but this is indeterminate.

['ZH_T31_1596_002:0276c13_8']	以依炷故焰得生，即炷為焰生因；	以依炷故焰得生，即炷為焰生因；	002	Because it relies on the wick, the flame is able to arise, and the wick becomes the cause for the flame's arising;
