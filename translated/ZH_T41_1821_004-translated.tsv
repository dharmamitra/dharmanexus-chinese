['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b15_11']	論曰至隨一不減者。	論曰至隨一不減者。	The treatise states: In the desire realm, the smallest aggregation of form has at least one of the eight factors, with no less.

['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b18_9']	即釋上兩句。	即釋上兩句。	It explains the above two lines.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b18_18']	於欲界中色聚極細。	於欲界中色聚極細。	In the desire realm, the aggregation of form is the most subtle.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b19_4']	無聲無根。	無聲無根。	It is without sound and without faculties.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b19_18']	外山．河等猶八俱生隨一不減。	外山．河等猶八俱生隨一不減。	The external mountains, rivers, etc. still have eight factors arising together, with at least one not less.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b20_4']	立微聚名。	立微聚名。	It is given the name subtle aggregation.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b21_2']	為顯更無細於此者　言微聚者。	為顯更無細於此者　言微聚者。	This is to show that there is nothing finer than this. The term subtle aggregation
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b21_7']	顯細少聚。	顯細少聚。	shows that it is subtle, few, and aggregated.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b22_2']	謂色聚中極少細聚名為微聚。	謂色聚中極少細聚名為微聚。	In the aggregation of form, the smallest and most subtle aggregation is called a subtle aggregation.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b22_8']	即微是聚也。	即微是聚也。	The subtle itself is the aggregation.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b22_17']	非是極微名為微聚。	非是極微名為微聚。	It is not that extremely subtle particles are called a collection of subtle particles.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b23_5']	又正理第十云。	又正理第十云。	Also, the tenth chapter of the Nyāyapraveśa says:
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b23_14']	如是眾微展轉和合。	如是眾微展轉和合。	In this way, many subtle particles are mutually combined.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b24_14']	定不離者說為微聚彼論微之聚故名為微聚。	定不離者說為微聚彼論微之聚故名為微聚。	Those that are definitely not separated are called a collection of subtle particles. That treatise calls them a collection of subtle particles because they are a collection of subtle particles.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b24_19']	各據一義。	各據一義。	Each has its own meaning.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b24_26']	亦不相違應知。	亦不相違應知。	It should be understood that they are also not contradictory. One should know that.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b25_2']	微有二種。	微有二種。	There are two kinds of subtle particles.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b25_7']	一色聚微。	一色聚微。	The first is a collection of subtle particles of form.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b26_1']	即極少八事俱生不可減也。	即極少八事俱生不可減也。	It is the least that can arise together with eight things and cannot be reduced further.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b26_7']	此論據斯說。	此論據斯說。	This treatise is based on this to explain.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b26_12']	二極微微。	二極微微。	The second is an extremely subtle subtle particle.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b27_2']	即色極少更不可分。	即色極少更不可分。	It is the least that can be divided no further.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b27_8']	正理據此說。	正理據此說。	The Nyāyapraveśa is based on this to explain.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b27_14']	云何八事者。	云何八事者。	What are the eight things?
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b27_16']	問。	問。	This is the question.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b28_10']	謂四大種至色香味觸者。	謂四大種至色香味觸者。	It refers to the four great elements, form, smell, taste, and touch.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b28_12']	答。	答。	This is the answer.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b28_16']	數可知。	數可知。	The number can be known.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b29_10']	無聲有根至處各別故者。	無聲有根至處各別故者。	Because there is no sound, there are faculties, and the locations are different.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070b29_15']	釋下兩句。	釋下兩句。	This explains the last two sentences.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c01_3']	若內無聲有根。	若內無聲有根。	If there is no sound inside, there are faculties.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c01_16']	諸極微聚有身根聚九事俱生。	諸極微聚有身根聚九事俱生。	In the collection of subtle particles, there is a collection of body faculties that arises together with nine things.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c02_11']	八事如前外無聲處身為第九。	八事如前外無聲處身為第九。	The eight things are as before, with the addition of the body as the ninth, in a place without external sounds.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c03_9']	有餘眼．耳．鼻．舌根聚十事俱生。	有餘眼．耳．鼻．舌根聚十事俱生。	In some cases, the aggregates of eye, ear, nose, and tongue faculties are born together with ten things.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c04_4']	九事如前有身根處加眼等一。	九事如前有身根處加眼等一。	Nine things are as before, with the addition of one of the body faculties.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c05_1']	眼．耳．鼻．舌必不離身依身轉故。	眼．耳．鼻．舌必不離身依身轉故。	The eye, ear, nose, and tongue faculties are never separate from the body, because they depend on the body to function.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c05_6']	顯定有身。	顯定有身。	This shows that the body definitely exists.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c06_1']	眼等四根展轉相望處各別故。	眼等四根展轉相望處各別故。	The four faculties of eye, ear, nose, and tongue are each in a different location when compared to each other.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c06_6']	顯非同聚。	顯非同聚。	This shows that they are not in the same aggregate.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c07_1']	於前諸聚至大種因起者。	於前諸聚至大種因起者。	In the previous aggregates, up to the origination of the great elements,
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c07_6']	此別顯加。	此別顯加。	This specifically shows the addition.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c07_17']	於前八．九．十等諸聚。	於前八．九．十等諸聚。	In the previous aggregates of eight, nine, ten, and so on,
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c08_5']	若有聲生八增至九。	若有聲生八增至九。	If sound is produced, the eight increase to nine.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c08_10']	九增至十。	九增至十。	The nine increase to ten.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c08_16']	十增至十一。	十增至十一。	The ten increase to eleven.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c09_8']	以有聲處下通伏難。	以有聲處下通伏難。	The existence of the sound realm below resolves a potential objection.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c09_13']	伏難意云。	伏難意云。	The intention of the objection is as follows:
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c10_4']	外聲相顯此即可知。	外聲相顯此即可知。	External sounds are clearly manifest, so this can be known.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c10_13']	內有根處何得有聲。	內有根處何得有聲。	How can there be sound in the internal faculties?
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c11_8']	故今通言以有聲處不離根生。	故今通言以有聲處不離根生。	Therefore, it is now explained that the existence of the sound realm is not separate from the faculties.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c11_17']	謂有執受大種因起。	謂有執受大種因起。	It is said that it arises with the great elements that are conjoined as its cause.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c13_3']	此即正顯不離根聲　又解內聲相隱所以偏明。	此即正顯不離根聲　又解內聲相隱所以偏明。	This directly shows that sound is not separate from the faculties. Another explanation is that the characteristics of internal sound are hidden, so it is specifically clarified.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c15_4']	外聲相顯故不別說　又解不說外聲影顯可知　問於內身中聲若新加至十．十一。	外聲相顯故不別說　又解不說外聲影顯可知　問於內身中聲若新加至十．十一。	External sound has obvious characteristics, so it is not explained separately. Another explanation is that external sound is not mentioned, but it can be understood by implication. A question is asked: If sound is newly added to the internal body from the tenth to the eleventh,
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c16_4']	何故發智論云若成就身定成就色．聲觸。	何故發智論云若成就身定成就色．聲觸。	why does the Abhidharma-jñāna-vibhāṣā-śāstra say: If one possesses the body, one definitely possesses form, sound, and touch.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c16_7']	又云。	又云。	And it says:
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c16_16']	身．色．聲．觸界。	身．色．聲．觸界。	The realms of body, form, sound, and touch
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c16_22']	欲色界成就。	欲色界成就。	Are accomplished in the desire and form realms.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c17_6']	無色界不成就。	無色界不成就。	They are not accomplished in the formless realm.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c17_11']	准彼論文。	准彼論文。	According to that treatise,
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c18_1']	內有情身恒成就聲。	內有情身恒成就聲。	The internal bodies of sentient beings always accomplish sound.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c19_8']	如何此論說聲新加　解云聲在內身雖定成就相續不斷。	如何此論說聲新加　解云聲在內身雖定成就相續不斷。	How can this treatise say that sound is newly added? The explanation is: Although sound in the internal body is definitely accomplished and continues without interruption,
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c19_17']	非能總遍一切身分。	非能總遍一切身分。	It cannot universally pervade all parts of the body.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c20_12']	發智言成據一身中相續不斷。	發智言成據一身中相續不斷。	The statement of accomplishment in the Abhidharma is based on its continuous existence in one body.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c21_8']	此論言無據身一分不發聲處。	此論言無據身一分不發聲處。	The statement of non-existence in this treatise is based on the fact that sound is not produced in some parts of the body.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c21_17']	各據一義竝不相違。	各據一義竝不相違。	Each of these explanations is based on a single meaning and does not contradict the others.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c22_6']	故婆沙九十云。	故婆沙九十云。	Therefore the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra says:
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c22_15']	身．色．聲．觸界。	身．色．聲．觸界。	The realms of body, form, sound, and touch
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c22_22']	欲．色界成就。	欲．色界成就。	are accomplished in the desire realm and form realm.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c23_7']	無色界不成就者。	無色界不成就者。	They are not accomplished in the formless realm.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c23_17']	問身．色．觸界可爾。	問身．色．觸界可爾。	Question: The realms of body, form, and touch may be so.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c24_6']	聲界云何恒時成就。	聲界云何恒時成就。	How can the realm of sound always be accomplished?
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c24_11']	有作是說。	有作是說。	Some say:
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c25_1']	大種合離必生聲界。	大種合離必生聲界。	The combination and separation of the four great elements necessarily produces the realm of sound.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c25_10']	有情若在欲色界中。	有情若在欲色界中。	If sentient beings are in the desire realm or form realm,
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c26_1']	大種恒有故常發聲。	大種恒有故常發聲。	the four great elements always exist, and therefore sound is always produced.
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c26_4']	評曰。	評曰。	The treatise evaluates this:
['ZH_T41_1821_004:0070c26_11']	彼不應作是說。	彼不應作是說。	They should not say this.
