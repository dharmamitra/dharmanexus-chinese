['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b11_7']	7 七辯緣起品第三之七如是所成取為緣故，馳求種種可意境時，必定牽生招當有業。	7 七辯緣起品第三之七如是所成取為緣故，馳求種種可意境時，必定牽生招當有業。	027	Chapter 3, section 7 on the seven kinds of eloquence, as in the previous section. When one takes the above as conditions and runs after various pleasing objects, one will definitely give rise to and attract karma that will lead to future existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b13_14']	謂由愛力取增盛時，種種馳求善不善境，為得彼故，積集眾多能招後有淨不淨業，此業生位總名有支。	謂由愛力取增盛時，種種馳求善不善境，為得彼故，積集眾多能招後有淨不淨業，此業生位總名有支。	027	That is to say, when the power of craving increases due to grasping, one runs after various good and bad objects in various ways. In order to obtain them, one accumulates much pure and impure karma that can lead to future existence. This karma, in the stage of arising, is collectively called the link of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b14_13']	應知此中由此依此能有當果，故立有名。	應知此中由此依此能有當果，故立有名。	027	One should know that in this case, it is called existence because it can have future results based on this.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b14_18']	上座釋言：	上座釋言：	027	The elder explains:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b15_8']	有謂有性，故世尊說：	有謂有性，故世尊說：	027	Existence refers to the nature of existence. Therefore, the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b15_17']	有謂當來後有生起。	有謂當來後有生起。	027	Existence refers to the arising of future existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b16_10']	有性即是當來世中果生起義。	有性即是當來世中果生起義。	027	The nature of existence is the meaning of the arising of future results.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b17_10']	如是所釋，理教相違，有應與生無差別故。	如是所釋，理教相違，有應與生無差別故。	027	This explanation contradicts both reasoning and teachings, because existence should be no different from arising.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b18_8']	當果生起體即生支，則緣起支便應數減。	當果生起體即生支，則緣起支便應數減。	027	If the body that is produced by the present existence is the same as the member of birth, then the members of dependent origination would be reduced in number.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b19_17']	若謂現業是有因故假立有名，亦不應理，業體即是現有性故。	若謂現業是有因故假立有名，亦不應理，業體即是現有性故。	027	If you say that present action is called existence because it is the cause of future existence, this also is unreasonable, because the substance of action is the present nature of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b21_1']	業是現有性，能為當有因，故不可但言有因故名有。	業是現有性，能為當有因，故不可但言有因故名有。	027	Action is the present nature of existence and is able to be the cause of future existence. Therefore you cannot say that it is called existence only because it is a cause of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b21_11']	自性是有，寧假立名？	自性是有，寧假立名？	027	If its own nature is existence, why is it necessary to give it the name existence?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b22_11']	如業有為因感異熟，有此果有，豈假因有為名？	如業有為因感異熟，有此果有，豈假因有為名？	027	Just as action is the cause that attracts retribution, and existence is the result of this cause. How can it be said that existence is given the name existence because it is a cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b23_12']	設許假立名，非失有自體，能有所有俱有性故。	設許假立名，非失有自體，能有所有俱有性故。	027	Even if it is granted that the name is given hypothetically, this does not mean that it does not have its own substance, because the cause and the result are of the same nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b24_13']	為證彼義，不應引此經，由此經文有異誦者故。	為證彼義，不應引此經，由此經文有異誦者故。	027	In order to prove this meaning, you should not cite this scripture, because there is a different recitation of the text of this scripture.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b24_18']	云何異誦？	云何異誦？	027	What is the different recitation?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b25_3']	如有誦言：	如有誦言：	027	There is a recitation that says:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b25_12']	有謂能令後有生起。	有謂能令後有生起。	027	Existence is that which causes the production of subsequent existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b26_11']	設如彼誦，理亦無違，此於因中說果名故。	設如彼誦，理亦無違，此於因中說果名故。	027	Even if we grant that the recitation is as you say, there is no disagreement with our interpretation, because in this case the name of the result is applied to the cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b27_10']	由有體是當有起因，假說當來後有生起。	由有體是當有起因，假說當來後有生起。	027	Because the existence of the cause of future rebirth is designated as future rebirth.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b27_20']	為顯此義，故世尊說：	為顯此義，故世尊說：	027	In order to illustrate this meaning, the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b28_4']	取緣有已。	取緣有已。	027	Grasping is the condition for existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b28_18']	次為顯有是生緣故，說此契經。	次為顯有是生緣故，說此契經。	027	Next, in order to show that existence is the condition for birth, this sūtra is spoken.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b29_12']	又有於生為因最近，故契經說：	又有於生為因最近，故契經說：	027	Moreover, existence is the most proximate cause for birth, therefore a sūtra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491b29_17']	業為生因。	業為生因。	027	Karma is the cause for birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c02_3']	為顯業有是生近因，故於業有因上假說果名，此事必然。	為顯業有是生近因，故於業有因上假說果名，此事必然。	027	In order to show that karma has the most proximate cause for birth, therefore the effect is provisionally designated on the cause of existence of karma, this matter is inevitable.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c02_18']	故後總結，言取緣有，有緣生故。	故後總結，言取緣有，有緣生故。	027	Therefore, the concluding summary says: Grasping is the condition for existence, existence is the condition for birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c03_7']	又餘經說，佛告慶喜：	又餘經說，佛告慶喜：	027	Moreover, another sūtra says, the Buddha told Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c03_17']	招後有業，此中名有。	招後有業，此中名有。	027	The karma that brings about rebirth is called existence here.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c04_14']	是故上座所引契經，於自釋有不堪為證。	是故上座所引契經，於自釋有不堪為證。	027	Therefore, the sūtra cited by the elder is not sufficient evidence for his own interpretation of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c05_14']	唯對法者所釋有名，符理順經最為殊勝。	唯對法者所釋有名，符理順經最為殊勝。	027	Only the interpretation of existence by the Abhidharma masters accords with reason and the sūtras, and is most excellent.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c06_7']	有有二種，謂業、異熟。	有有二種，謂業、異熟。	027	Existence is of two kinds: karma and karmic retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c07_5']	今於此中唯取業有，辯當生果近因性故。	今於此中唯取業有，辯當生果近因性故。	027	Now, in this context, only karma-existence is taken, because it is explained as the proximate cause of the future result.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c07_14']	如前異誦契經中言：	如前異誦契經中言：	027	As stated in the previous variant sutra:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c08_4']	有謂能令後有生起。	有謂能令後有生起。	027	Existence means that which causes future rebirth.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c10_2']	即如前際業說行支，今後際中業名為有，此顯生死前後際同，惑業為因招異熟果。	即如前際業說行支，今後際中業名為有，此顯生死前後際同，惑業為因招異熟果。	027	Just as karma in the previous period is called the link of karmic formations, so karma in the future period is called existence. This shows that the causes of affliction and karma at the previous and future limits of cyclic existence are the same in attracting the result of karmic maturation.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c11_3']	上座妄執此有支名總攝一切有，經不別說故。	上座妄執此有支名總攝一切有，經不別說故。	027	The elder wrongly grasps the term existence as comprehensively including all existences, because the sutra does not specifically mention them.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c12_2']	謂佛總說有略有三，故知有支攝一切有。	謂佛總說有略有三，故知有支攝一切有。	027	That is to say, the Buddha generally speaks of existence as being of three kinds, therefore we know that the link of existence includes all existences.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c13_1']	若不爾者，世尊但應說此為行，或說為業。	若不爾者，世尊但應說此為行，或說為業。	027	If it were not so, the World-Honored One should have only spoken of it as karmic formations, or spoken of it as karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c13_11']	復有經證，如契經言：	復有經證，如契經言：	027	There is also a sutra that provides evidence, as a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c13_20']	有謂當來後有生起。	有謂當來後有生起。	027	Existence means the arising of future rebirth.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c14_8']	又世尊告阿難陀言：	又世尊告阿難陀言：	027	Also, the World-Honored One told Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c14_20']	有略有三，欲、色、無色。	有略有三，欲、色、無色。	027	Existence is generally of three kinds: desire, form, and formless.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c15_7']	又世尊告阿難陀言：	又世尊告阿難陀言：	027	Also, the World-Honored One told Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c15_16']	業感當來後有名有。	業感當來後有名有。	027	Karma attracts future rebirth, which is called existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c16_2']	又契經說：	又契經說：	027	Another scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c16_12']	諸有若無，頗有有不？	諸有若無，頗有有不？	027	If there were no existence, could there be non-existence?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c16_17']	乃至廣說。	乃至廣說。	027	And so on, at length.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c17_14']	故取能作業有生因，業為有助令生有起。	故取能作業有生因，業為有助令生有起。	027	Therefore, grasping is the productive cause of action, and action is the contributory cause that makes grasping arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c19_3']	是為略述上座所宗，如是所言皆非善說，雖不別說然應別解。	是為略述上座所宗，如是所言皆非善說，雖不別說然應別解。	027	This is a brief statement of the tenets of the Sthaviras. Such statements are all not well-said. Although not specifically mentioned, they should be explained separately.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c21_4']	如說識等緣名色等，雖於此中總說三界所有緣起，而許依容有說識緣名色、名色緣六處。	如說識等緣名色等，雖於此中總說三界所有緣起，而許依容有說識緣名色、名色緣六處。	027	As it is said that consciousness, etc. are the conditions for name-and-form, etc., although the dependent origination of all in the three realms is generally discussed here, it is accepted that consciousness is said to be the condition for name-and-form, and name-and-form is said to be the condition for the six sense bases, based on the possibility of their occurrence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c21_18']	如是此中雖不別說，而應別解。	如是此中雖不別說，而應別解。	027	In the same way, although not specifically mentioned here, it should be explained separately.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c22_10']	謂三界繫業，說三界有名。	謂三界繫業，說三界有名。	027	Namely, the karma of the three realms is said to be the name of the three realms.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c22_16']	如是有何過？	如是有何過？	027	What is the error in this?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c23_6']	若異此者，應攝非情。	若異此者，應攝非情。	027	If it were otherwise, it would include insentient things.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c23_11']	謂彼自言：	謂彼自言：	027	Namely, they themselves say:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c24_13']	若於此法，欲色無色貪等隨增，此法如應名三界有。	若於此法，欲色無色貪等隨增，此法如應名三界有。	027	If desire, form, and formless realms, such as craving, etc., increase in this dharma, this dharma is called the existence of the three realms as appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c26_2']	非情諸法亦欲色界貪等隨增，以於此中不別說故，亦應攝彼；	非情諸法亦欲色界貪等隨增，以於此中不別說故，亦應攝彼；	027	The attachment of the realm of desire and the realm of form increase in regard to dharmas that are not associated with mind, because they are not mentioned separately. They should be included,
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c26_12']	而彼不許，故非總攝。	而彼不許，故非總攝。	027	but they are not accepted as such. Therefore, they are not included in the general statement.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0491c27_18']	若謂此中依無明等有情說故，雖總說有而不可謂亦攝非情。	若謂此中依無明等有情說故，雖總說有而不可謂亦攝非情。	027	If it is said that in this passage, sentient beings are discussed on the basis of ignorance, etc., although they are generally said to exist, they cannot be said to include insentient things.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a01_18']	豈不此中但依流轉還滅次第，及依惑業為因感生次第說故，雖總說有，而隨所應但依不善、善有漏業，說為欲、色、無色三有。	豈不此中但依流轉還滅次第，及依惑業為因感生次第說故，雖總說有，而隨所應但依不善、善有漏業，說為欲、色、無色三有。	027	Isn’t it that in this passage, the order of evolution and involution and the order of the causes of affliction and action in producing birth are discussed? Therefore, although it is said in general that they exist, they are only discussed in accordance with what is appropriate, i.e., only unwholesome and wholesome contaminated action is discussed as the three kinds of existence of desire, form, and formlessness.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a02_14']	若此有體如彼行支，何不如彼以行名說？	若此有體如彼行支，何不如彼以行名說？	027	If the substance of this existence is like the member of action, why is it not discussed like that member under the name of action?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a03_12']	前於思擇行名義中已辯餘無所隨義故。	前於思擇行名義中已辯餘無所隨義故。	027	It has already been discussed under the name of action in the previous discussion of the meaning of the name action.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a03_17']	何不名業？	何不名業？	027	Why is it not called action?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a05_11']	為欲顯此感後有因是業差別，非一切業皆後有因，故立有名不說為業。	為欲顯此感後有因是業差別，非一切業皆後有因，故立有名不說為業。	027	In order to show that the cause that attracts subsequent existence is a kind of action and not all action is a cause of subsequent existence, the name existence is established and it is not called action.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a06_22']	又業名有，聖教極成，如《七有經》說為業有，故彼所說，不別說故。	又業名有，聖教極成，如《七有經》說為業有，故彼所說，不別說故。	027	Also, the name existence is well known in the holy teachings, as in the scripture on the seven existences, which says, Existence is due to action. Therefore their explanation is not good, because it does not distinguish the two.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a07_17']	知有支名攝諸有者，違理教故非為善說。	知有支名攝諸有者，違理教故非為善說。	027	To say that the name member of existence includes all existences is not a good explanation, because it contradicts reason and the teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a08_7']	彼所引經應正詳辯。	彼所引經應正詳辯。	027	The scriptures they quote must be carefully examined.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a10_14']	且初所引頗勒具那契經中說，有謂當來後有生起，此前已釋，謂此經文有異誦故，及於因中說果名故。	且初所引頗勒具那契經中說，有謂當來後有生起，此前已釋，謂此經文有異誦故，及於因中說果名故。	027	First, as for the scripture on Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, it says that existence is the production of a later existence in the future. This has already been explained above, because there is a variant reading of this scripture and because the name of the result is applied to the cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a13_2']	又彼所引三有契經亦不相違，總問答故，非我等說一切取蘊不皆名有，但有支內業有勝故唯業得名。	又彼所引三有契經亦不相違，總問答故，非我等說一切取蘊不皆名有，但有支內業有勝故唯業得名。	027	Also, the scripture on the three existences that they quote does not contradict our interpretation, because it is a general question and answer. We do not say that all the aggregates of grasping are not called existence, but only that among the members of existence, action is the most important and therefore only action is called existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a15_2']	然彼阿難陀總問諸有、不問有支故，佛還總答，故彼所引非證有支通以三界諸有為體。	然彼阿難陀總問諸有、不問有支故，佛還總答，故彼所引非證有支通以三界諸有為體。	027	However, Ānanda asked in general about all existences and did not ask about the members of existence, and therefore the Buddha answered in general. Therefore the scripture they quote does not prove that the members of existence are, in general, the substance of all existences in the three realms.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a16_1']	又彼所引二有契經亦不相違，以總說故。	又彼所引二有契經亦不相違，以總說故。	027	Also, the two sutra passages that they cite are not contradictory, because they are spoken in a general way.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a16_19']	謂於業有異熟有中總說有聲，俱有性故。	謂於業有異熟有中總說有聲，俱有性故。	027	That is, the word “existence” is used in a general way to refer to the existence of action and the existence of results of retribution, because they are both existent.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a17_16']	前三界有總以有聲說三界繫一切業果。	前三界有總以有聲說三界繫一切業果。	027	The first three realms of existence are generally referred to as existence and are said to be bound to the three realms because they are the results of all action.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a18_16']	今此為顯因果差別，業與異熟說為別有。	今此為顯因果差別，業與異熟說為別有。	027	Now, in order to reveal the differences of cause and effect, action and its results of retribution are said to be separate existences.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a20_13']	或三界有以一有聲說無量門諸有漏法，今此但說感當來業及後有果總名為有。	或三界有以一有聲說無量門諸有漏法，今此但說感當來業及後有果總名為有。	027	Or, the three realms of existence are generally referred to as one existence, because they are the many impure dharmas that are its doors. Now, only the action that attracts future existence and the result of retribution of future existence are generally referred to as existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a22_12']	或此經說業感當來後有名有，此經正辯感後有業名為有支，如何引之證通名有？	或此經說業感當來後有名有，此經正辯感後有業名為有支，如何引之證通名有？	027	Or, this scripture speaks of action that attracts future existence and future existence as existence. The scripture is correctly interpreting the action that attracts future existence and calls it the member of existence. How can you cite it as evidence that the general name is existence?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a23_2']	故此文後復作是言：	故此文後復作是言：	027	Therefore, after this passage, the scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a24_1']	若欲界繫業有無者，頗得施設欲界有耶？	若欲界繫業有無者，頗得施設欲界有耶？	027	If there is action bound to the realm of desire, can one establish the existence of the realm of desire?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a24_4', 'ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a24_7']	不也。🔽世尊！	不也。 世尊！	027	No, World-Honored One.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a24_12']	乃至廣說。	乃至廣說。	027	In detail.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0492a27_17']	此顯要有業有方有異熟有義，即正說有緣生謂當生位，已有身根命根異熟說名後有，如是即以有聲說生，非業俱行異熟名有，此於後有無感用故。	此顯要有業有方有異熟有義，即正說有緣生謂當生位，已有身根命根異熟說名後有，如是即以有聲說生，非業俱行異熟名有，此於後有無感用故。	027	This shows that there must be karma, a place, a ripening, and a meaning. The dependent origination that is being discussed is the existence that will arise. In the state of arising, there is already the ripening of the body faculty and life faculty, which is called subsequent existence.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494b24_6']	謂結生時所有五蘊，於有情相續非並能為緣，契經但言識入胎故。	謂結生時所有五蘊，於有情相續非並能為緣，契經但言識入胎故。	027	This means that the five aggregates at the time of connecting with rebirth are not all able to be conditions for the continuity of sentient beings, because the sutra only says that consciousness enters the womb.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494b26_8']	又失生惑業次第生理故，謂從六處觸受次第起諸煩惱，煩惱發業，業復引生，皆不成故。	又失生惑業次第生理故，謂從六處觸受次第起諸煩惱，煩惱發業，業復引生，皆不成故。	027	Moreover, it loses the principle of the order of birth, afflictions, and karma, because it means that the various afflictions arise in order from the six sense bases, contact, and feeling, and the afflictions give rise to karma, and karma again leads to birth, all of which are not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494b28_5']	又因差別應不成故，謂說有情前後諸蘊，皆總相望前為後因，則失立因差別道理。	又因差別應不成故，謂說有情前後諸蘊，皆總相望前為後因，則失立因差別道理。	027	Moreover, the distinction of causes should not be established, because it means that the various aggregates before and after sentient beings are generally compared to each other, and the previous ones are the causes of the later ones, then the principle of establishing causes with distinctions is lost.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c01_13']	雖有前後無間而生，然非一切因能生一切果，如色法起雖藉外緣，然自種力無間引起諸心心所各別因生。	雖有前後無間而生，然非一切因能生一切果，如色法起雖藉外緣，然自種力無間引起諸心心所各別因生。	027	Although there is a succession of causes and effects without interruption, not all causes can produce all effects. For example, although the arising of form depends on external conditions, the power of its own seeds immediately produces it. The various minds and mental activities are born from their own specific causes.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c06_13']	又應愛等不數生故，謂受為緣數生於愛，惑愛為緣數生於取，若許分位，此不應成，其位已過無重起故。	又應愛等不數生故，謂受為緣數生於愛，惑愛為緣數生於取，若許分位，此不應成，其位已過無重起故。	027	Also, craving, etc., would not arise frequently, because feeling as a condition gives rise frequently to craving, and craving as a condition gives rise frequently to grasping. If you admit that there is a difference in states, this would not be so, because the state would have already passed and would not arise again.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c09_3']	又《緣起經》是了義故，謂此經義佛自決了，前際無智等名為無明，福非福不動說名為行，六識身等名為識等。	又《緣起經》是了義故，謂此經義佛自決了，前際無智等名為無明，福非福不動說名為行，六識身等名為識等。	027	Also, because the Scripture on Dependent Origination is of explicit meaning, that is, the meaning of this scripture is decided and understood by the Buddha himself. He says that ignorance is the lack of knowledge of the prior and subsequent links, that merit, nonmerit, and immobility are called action, and that the group of six consciousnesses, etc., are called consciousness, etc.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c11_1']	今謂上座所立諸因，無一能遮分位緣起。	今謂上座所立諸因，無一能遮分位緣起。	027	Now, the reasons established by the elder are none of which can refute the conditioned arising of states.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c12_1']	且初結生不應理者，此非正因，就勝說故。	且初結生不應理者，此非正因，就勝說故。	027	First, the claim that the initial conception is unreasonable is not a proper reason, because it is said in terms of the superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c13_3']	謂初結生位，識用最強故，入母胎時偏說其識。	謂初結生位，識用最強故，入母胎時偏說其識。	027	That is to say, at the time of the initial conception, the function of consciousness is the strongest, therefore when entering the mother's womb, only consciousness is mentioned.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c15_9']	然非離受想等識可獨生，相應俱有因中已廣成立，故就勝說識入母胎，此顯所依無，能依必非有。	然非離受想等識可獨生，相應俱有因中已廣成立，故就勝說識入母胎，此顯所依無，能依必非有。	027	However, apart from feeling, conception, etc., consciousness cannot arise alone, because the causes of association and co-existence have been extensively established, therefore in terms of the superior, it is said that consciousness enters the mother's womb. This shows that if the basis does not exist, the dependent must also not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c16_18']	上座自說，佛以識聲總說一切心心所法，故識支通攝一切心心所。	上座自說，佛以識聲總說一切心心所法，故識支通攝一切心心所。	027	The elder himself says that the Buddha uses the term consciousness to generally refer to all mental factors, therefore the link of consciousness includes all mental factors.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c20_13']	謂如識位就勝為名，六處等位中六處等勝故，於六處等位說六處等名。	謂如識位就勝為名，六處等位中六處等勝故，於六處等位說六處等名。	027	That is, in the state of consciousness, the name is established on the basis of the most outstanding factor, and in the states of the six sense bases, etc., the six sense bases, etc., are the most outstanding factors. Therefore, in the states of the six sense bases, etc., the names of the six sense bases, etc., are mentioned.

The passions give rise to karma, and karma again gives rise to birth. What is wrong with this?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c23_19']	若如經說而執義者，定失如是次第生義，謂非六處獨能生觸，以說三和而有觸故。	若如經說而執義者，定失如是次第生義，謂非六處獨能生觸，以說三和而有觸故。	027	If one grasps the meaning of the sūtra passages in this way, one definitely loses the meaning of the order of arising, because it is not the case that the six sense bases alone can give rise to contact, because it is said that contact exists due to the union of the three.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c24_9']	觸既非有，受從何生？	觸既非有，受從何生？	027	Since contact does not exist, from what does feeling arise?

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c26_15']	復有餘經說觸生愛，應不唯說觸為受緣則失有支次第生理。	復有餘經說觸生愛，應不唯說觸為受緣則失有支次第生理。	027	Moreover, there are other sūtras that say contact gives rise to craving. If one does not say that contact is the condition for feeling, then one loses the principle of the order of arising of the members of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c28_7']	是故憎背分位有支，言失生惑業次第生理者，彼所說過自害彼宗。	是故憎背分位有支，言失生惑業次第生理者，彼所說過自害彼宗。	027	Therefore, those who reject the existence of the members of existence in the state of birth and say that the principle of the order of arising of passions, karma, and so forth is lost commit a fault that destroys their own position.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0494c29_15']	又因差別應不成者，理亦不然，依分位說因差別理乃善成故。	又因差別應不成者，理亦不然，依分位說因差別理乃善成故。	027	Also, the reason that “the distinctions of causes would not be established” is not reasonable, because the principle of distinctions of causes is well established on the basis of states.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a03_12']	謂非我等許從一切還生一切是差別因，以諸位中許有少色，於所餘色為勝生因，或有少色於心心所，心心所法為因亦然。	謂非我等許從一切還生一切是差別因，以諸位中許有少色，於所餘色為勝生因，或有少色於心心所，心心所法為因亦然。	027	This is because we do not admit that everything arises from everything else. The reason for distinctions is that in all states, some dharmas are admitted as superior generative causes of other dharmas. For example, some material dharmas are superior generative causes of other material dharmas, and some material dharmas are superior generative causes of mind and its activities. The same is true of mind and its activities.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a05_1']	非我所宗說一切位色心心所皆為勝因，彼彼位生種種別故。	非我所宗說一切位色心心所皆為勝因，彼彼位生種種別故。	027	We do not maintain that all material dharmas and mind and its activities in all states are superior generative causes, because in the various states, there are various distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a06_17']	有位色勝、有位心勝、有位心所隨一為勝，由遇彼彼差別因緣，如是如是差別生故。	有位色勝、有位心勝、有位心所隨一為勝，由遇彼彼差別因緣，如是如是差別生故。	027	In some states, material dharmas are superior, in some states, mind is superior, and in some states, one of the mental activities is superior, because, encountering this or that distinct cause and condition, there is this or that distinction in arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a08_7']	唯許分位緣起理中，得有如斯因果差別分明可見，何乃撥無？	唯許分位緣起理中，得有如斯因果差別分明可見，何乃撥無？	027	Only in the principle of dependent origination in states can we see clearly the distinctions of cause and effect. Why do you deny them?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a09_6']	又於無學成過失者，此無有失，是所許故。	又於無學成過失者，此無有失，是所許故。	027	As for the error that you say we commit in regard to the post-learner, this is not an error, because it is admitted.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a10_14']	謂於愛位或於取位得阿羅漢，我宗許彼無愛緣取及取緣有。	謂於愛位或於取位得阿羅漢，我宗許彼無愛緣取及取緣有。	027	We admit that an arhat who has attained his state through the power of the path of vision or through the power of the worldly path does not have craving as a condition for grasping or grasping as a condition for becoming.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a13_5']	上座若謂得阿羅漢，猶有愛緣取及取緣有者，是則因有應復招生，既復招生定有老死，如是應供當自歸依。	上座若謂得阿羅漢，猶有愛緣取及取緣有者，是則因有應復招生，既復招生定有老死，如是應供當自歸依。	027	If the elder Vasubandhu says that an arhat who has attained his state through the power of the worldly path still has craving as a condition for grasping and grasping as a condition for becoming, then it follows that becoming would again give rise to birth, and since birth would again give rise to old age and death, the arhat would have to take refuge in himself.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a14_13']	然非此中所說緣起，總依一切補特伽羅，是故無容於此設難。	然非此中所說緣起，總依一切補特伽羅，是故無容於此設難。	027	However, the dependent origination that is being discussed here is based on all sentient beings in general, and therefore it is not possible to raise objections to it.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a16_3']	豈阿羅漢有愛有取，而可說言謂阿羅漢若愛取位得阿羅漢？	豈阿羅漢有愛有取，而可說言謂阿羅漢若愛取位得阿羅漢？	027	How can an arhat have craving and grasping? It can be said that an arhat who has attained his state through the power of the worldly path still has craving and grasping.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a18_11']	非離轉根有阿羅漢得阿羅漢，是故上座所出言詞非慧所發，豈能如實宣釋甚深微細難知緣起道理？	非離轉根有阿羅漢得阿羅漢，是故上座所出言詞非慧所發，豈能如實宣釋甚深微細難知緣起道理？	027	There is no arhat who attains arhatship without changing his faculties. Therefore the words spoken by the elder are not born of wisdom. How can he proclaim and explain the principle of dependent origination, which is profound, subtle, and difficult to understand?
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a19_12']	又應愛等不數生者，此亦無違，非所遮故。	又應愛等不數生者，此亦無違，非所遮故。	027	Moreover, it is not contradictory that craving, etc., do not arise frequently, because they are not being refuted.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0495a20_13']	謂非說分位緣起論者，言觸受愛取，餘位不行。	謂非說分位緣起論者，言觸受愛取，餘位不行。	027	Those who do not explain dependent arising in terms of states say that contact, feeling, craving, and grasping do not occur in other states.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496a11_22']	謂髮毛爪等。	謂髮毛爪等。	027	It refers to hair, body hair, nails, and so forth.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496a14_4']	彼謂所引不可為證，非彼經中欲以地界辯髮毛等。	彼謂所引不可為證，非彼經中欲以地界辯髮毛等。	027	They say that what is cited cannot be used as evidence, because in that sutra it is not intended to explain hair, body hair, and so forth with the earth element.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496a14_10']	若彼經問言：	若彼經問言：	027	If that sutra asks:

Just as in that aggregate, the earth element is predominant, and the other inferior ones are abandoned in favor of the predominant one.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496a23_17']	如是此中雖一一位皆具五蘊，而得於此就勝者說無明等支，如何乃言所引非證？	如是此中雖一一位皆具五蘊，而得於此就勝者說無明等支，如何乃言所引非證？	027	In the same way, although each of these stages is fully endowed with the five aggregates, one can speak of the members such as ignorance in terms of the predominant ones among them.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496a27_15']	諸阿羅漢雖有五蘊而無有行，隨福非福不動、行識乃至愛等，是故經義即如所說。	諸阿羅漢雖有五蘊而無有行，隨福非福不動、行識乃至愛等，是故經義即如所說。	027	Although arhats have the five aggregates, they do not have the activities of following merit, demerit, and immovable [karma], consciousness, up to craving, etc. Therefore, the meaning of the sutra is just as stated.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496a29_5']	如是所識無深理趣，俱有因義前已成立，經主於中非不忍許。	如是所識無深理趣，俱有因義前已成立，經主於中非不忍許。	027	In this way, the consciousness that is cognized does not have profound principles. The meaning of the co-existent cause has already been established. The master of the sutra does not admit it in the middle.

['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496b04_8']	唯執無明為行緣者，諸阿羅漢既雖有受而無有愛，應非唯受能為愛緣。	唯執無明為行緣者，諸阿羅漢既雖有受而無有愛，應非唯受能為愛緣。	027	Only those who grasp ignorance as the condition for activities, the arhats, although having feeling, do not have craving. It should not be that only feeling can be the condition for craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496b06_2']	然此經中說受緣愛，更無差別，故非如說即是經義，然更於中應求別理。	然此經中說受緣愛，更無差別，故非如說即是經義，然更於中應求別理。	027	However, in this sutra, it is said that feeling is the condition for craving, without any further distinction. Therefore, it is not the meaning of the sutra as it is stated. However, one should seek another principle in it.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496b08_19']	若無明觸所生諸受能為愛緣，非一切受，諸阿羅漢無無明故，雖有諸受而無愛者，豈不經義非即如說，經無如是分別說故。	若無明觸所生諸受能為愛緣，非一切受，諸阿羅漢無無明故，雖有諸受而無愛者，豈不經義非即如說，經無如是分別說故。	027	If the feeling born from the contact of ignorance can be a condition for craving, not all feeling, then even though arhats have feeling, they do not have craving, because they are without ignorance. Doesn’t this contradict the meaning of the sūtra? Because the sūtra does not make such a distinction as you say.
['ZH_T29_1562_027:0496b09_17']	由此應信順阿笈摩、不違正理是此經義。	由此應信順阿笈摩、不違正理是此經義。	027	Therefore, you should believe and accept the sūtra, which does not contradict correct reasoning, as the meaning of this sūtra.

Therefore, the meaning of this sūtra is explained according to what is most important. Then the principle of conditioned arising in terms of states is established.
