['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b05_1']	此中作因有八，一總相，為令眾生離苦得樂，不為貪求利養等故。	此中作因有八，一總相，為令眾生離苦得樂，不為貪求利養等故。	Herein, the causal basis for composition is eightfold: first, the general characteristic, in order to cause sentient beings to abandon suffering and attain happiness, not for the sake of seeking profit and offerings, etc.

The Buddha's form and mind were supreme, and he expounded boundless meanings and flavors in a single voice. Therefore, treatises were not necessary.

['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b22_5']	云何立義分？	云何立義分？	What is the section on establishing the meaning?
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b23_1']	謂摩訶衍略有二種，有法及法。	謂摩訶衍略有二種，有法及法。	It is said that the Mahāyāna is generally of two kinds: the existent and the dharma.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b23_13']	言有法者，謂一切眾生心。	言有法者，謂一切眾生心。	As for the existent, it refers to the mind of all sentient beings.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b26_9']	是心則攝一切世間出世間法，依此顯示摩訶衍義，以此心真如相即示大乘體故，此心生滅因緣相能顯示大乘體相用故。	是心則攝一切世間出世間法，依此顯示摩訶衍義，以此心真如相即示大乘體故，此心生滅因緣相能顯示大乘體相用故。	This mind includes all mundane and supramundane dharmas. Based on this, the meaning of the Mahāyāna is revealed, because the true suchness characteristic of this mind directly shows the essence of the Great Vehicle, and because the arising and ceasing conditioned arising characteristic of this mind can reveal the essence, characteristics, and functions of the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b26_19']	所言法者，略有三種。	所言法者，略有三種。	As for the dharma, there are generally three kinds.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b28_8']	一體大，謂一切法真如，在染在淨性恒平等，無增無減無別異故。	一體大，謂一切法真如，在染在淨性恒平等，無增無減無別異故。	First, the essence of the great, which refers to the suchness of all dharmas. Whether defiled or pure, its nature is always equal, without increase or decrease, without distinction.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584b29_11']	二者相大，謂如來藏本求具足無量無邊性功德故。	二者相大，謂如來藏本求具足無量無邊性功德故。	Second, the characteristics of the great, which refers to the fundamental endowment of the tathāgatagarbha with immeasurable and limitless inherent qualities.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c02_12']	三者用大，能生一切世出世間善因果故，一切諸佛本所乘故，一切菩薩皆乘於此入佛地故。	三者用大，能生一切世出世間善因果故，一切諸佛本所乘故，一切菩薩皆乘於此入佛地故。	Third, the function of the great, which refers to the ability to produce all mundane and supramundane good causes and effects, because it is the vehicle that all buddhas have originally ridden, and because all bodhisattvas all ride this to enter the stage of buddhahood.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c03_5']	云何解釋分？	云何解釋分？	What is the section on explanation?
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c04_13']	此有三種，所謂顯示實義故、對治邪執故、分別修行正道相故。	此有三種，所謂顯示實義故、對治邪執故、分別修行正道相故。	There are three kinds of this, namely, revealing the true meaning, countering false attachments, and distinguishing the characteristics of the correct path of practice.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c06_3']	此中顯示實義者，依於一心有二種門，所謂心真如門、心生滅門。	此中顯示實義者，依於一心有二種門，所謂心真如門、心生滅門。	Among them, revealing the true meaning is based on one mind with two kinds of gates, namely, the gate of the true suchness of mind and the gate of the arising and ceasing of mind.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c07_3']	此二種門各攝一切法，以此展轉不相離故。	此二種門各攝一切法，以此展轉不相離故。	These two kinds of gates each include all dharmas, because they are mutually inseparable.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c09_18']	心真如者，即是一法界大總相法門體，以心本性不生不滅相，一切諸法皆由妄念而有差別，若離妄念則無境界差別之相。	心真如者，即是一法界大總相法門體，以心本性不生不滅相，一切諸法皆由妄念而有差別，若離妄念則無境界差別之相。	As for the true suchness of mind, it is the essence of the great general characteristics of the one dharma realm, because the inherent nature of mind is unborn and unceasing. All dharmas are due to deluded thoughts and thus have distinctions. If one is apart from deluded thoughts, then there are no characteristics of distinctions among objects.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c12_15']	是故諸法從本已來性離語言，一切文字不能顯說，離心攀緣無有諸相，究竟平等永無變異不可破壞，唯是一心，說名真如。	是故諸法從本已來性離語言，一切文字不能顯說，離心攀緣無有諸相，究竟平等永無變異不可破壞，唯是一心，說名真如。	Therefore, all dharmas from the very beginning are devoid of language. All written words cannot express them. Apart from the mind grasping and clinging, there are no various characteristics. Ultimately equal, eternally unchanging, indestructible, only one mind, called true suchness.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c14_13']	以真如故，從本已來不可言說不可分別，一切言說唯假非實，但隨妄念無所有故。	以真如故，從本已來不可言說不可分別，一切言說唯假非實，但隨妄念無所有故。	Because of suchness, from the very beginning it cannot be spoken of or discriminated. All speech is only provisional and not real, because it only follows false thoughts and has no existence.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c16_11']	言真如者，此亦無相，但是一切言說中極以言遣言，非其體性有少可遣、有少可立。	言真如者，此亦無相，但是一切言說中極以言遣言，非其體性有少可遣、有少可立。	As for true suchness, it also has no characteristics. It is only the ultimate in speech among all speech, using words to eliminate words. Its essence cannot be eliminated or established in the slightest.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c16_14']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c17_7']	若如是者，眾生云何隨順悟入？	若如是者，眾生云何隨順悟入？	If it is like this, how do sentient beings follow and understand it?
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c17_10']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c19_12']	若知雖說一切法而無能說所說，雖念一切法而無能念所念，爾時隨順妄念都盡，名為悟入。	若知雖說一切法而無能說所說，雖念一切法而無能念所念，爾時隨順妄念都盡，名為悟入。	If one knows that although all dharmas are spoken of, there is no speaker or object spoken of, and although all dharmas are thought of, there is no thinker or object thought of, at that time, following the complete exhaustion of false thoughts, it is called understanding and entering.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c20_15']	復次真如者，依言說建立有二種別。	復次真如者，依言說建立有二種別。	Furthermore, as for true suchness, based on verbal establishment, there are two kinds of distinctions.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c21_15']	一真實空，究竟遠離不實之相，顯實體故。	一真實空，究竟遠離不實之相，顯實體故。	The first is true emptiness, ultimately free from unreal characteristics, manifesting the real essence.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c22_15']	二真實不空，本性具足無邊功德，有自體故。	二真實不空，本性具足無邊功德，有自體故。	The second is true non-emptiness, inherently endowed with boundless merits, having its own essence.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c24_14']	復次真實空者，從本已來一切染法不相應故，離一切法差別相故，無有虛妄分別心故。	復次真實空者，從本已來一切染法不相應故，離一切法差別相故，無有虛妄分別心故。	Furthermore, the true emptiness means that from the very beginning it is not associated with any defiled dharmas, it is free from the characteristics of all differentiated dharmas, and there is no false discriminating mind.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c26_16']	應知真如非有相、非無相、非有無相、非非有無相，非一相、非異相、非一異相、非非一異相。	應知真如非有相、非無相、非有無相、非非有無相，非一相、非異相、非一異相、非非一異相。	One should know that suchness is not a characteristic of existence, not a characteristic of non-existence, not a characteristic of both existence and non-existence, not a characteristic of neither existence nor non-existence, not a single characteristic, not a differentiated characteristic, not a characteristic of both being single and differentiated, and not a characteristic of neither being single nor differentiated.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c27_16']	略說以一切眾生妄分別心所不能觸，故立為空。	略說以一切眾生妄分別心所不能觸，故立為空。	In brief, because it cannot be touched by the discriminating minds of all sentient beings, it is established as emptiness.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0584c29_3']	據實道理，妄念非有、空性亦空，以所遮是無、能遮亦無故。	據實道理，妄念非有、空性亦空，以所遮是無、能遮亦無故。	According to the principle of reality, false thoughts do not exist, and the nature of emptiness is also empty, because what is negated is non-existent, and the negation itself is also non-existent.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a01_15']	言真實不空者，由妄念空無故，即顯真心常恒不變淨法圓滿，故名不空。	言真實不空者，由妄念空無故，即顯真心常恒不變淨法圓滿，故名不空。	As for the true non-emptiness, because false thoughts are empty and non-existent, it reveals that the true mind is eternally unchanging and the perfect dharmas are complete, thus it is called non-empty.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a03_1']	亦無不空相，以非妄念心所行故，唯離念智之所證故。	亦無不空相，以非妄念心所行故，唯離念智之所證故。	It also has no characteristic of non-emptiness, because it is not the object of the discriminating mind, and because it is only realized by the wisdom that is free from thoughts.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a05_17']	心生滅門者，謂依如來藏有生滅心轉，不生滅與生滅和合，非一非異，名阿賴耶識。	心生滅門者，謂依如來藏有生滅心轉，不生滅與生滅和合，非一非異，名阿賴耶識。	As for the arising and ceasing aspect of mind, it means that based on the tathāgatagarbha, the arising and ceasing mind arises and turns. The non-arising and ceasing and the arising and ceasing are united, neither the same nor different, and is called the ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a06_17']	此識有二種義，謂能攝一切法、能生一切法。	此識有二種義，謂能攝一切法、能生一切法。	This consciousness has two kinds of meanings, namely, it can include all dharmas and can give rise to all dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a07_14']	復有二種義，一者覺義、二者不覺義。	復有二種義，一者覺義、二者不覺義。	There are also two kinds of meanings, the first is the meaning of enlightenment and the second is the meaning of non-enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a08_12']	言覺義者，謂心第一義，性離一切妄念相。	言覺義者，謂心第一義，性離一切妄念相。	As for the meaning of enlightenment, it means the mind's ultimate truth, whose nature is free from all false thoughts.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a10_6']	離一切妄念相故，等虛空界無所不遍，法界一相，即是一切如來平等法身。	離一切妄念相故，等虛空界無所不遍，法界一相，即是一切如來平等法身。	Because it is free from all false thoughts, it is equal to the realm of space and pervades everywhere. The dharma realm is of one characteristic, which is precisely the equal dharma body of all tathāgatas.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a11_10']	依此法身，說一切如來為本覺，以待始覺立為本覺。	依此法身，說一切如來為本覺，以待始覺立為本覺。	Based on this dharma body, it is said that all tathāgatas are originally enlightened, and it is established as original enlightenment in contrast to subsequent enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a12_4']	然始覺時即是本覺，無別覺起。	然始覺時即是本覺，無別覺起。	However, when there is subsequent enlightenment, it is precisely original enlightenment, and no separate enlightenment arises.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a13_5']	立始覺者，謂依本覺有不覺，依不覺說有始覺。	立始覺者，謂依本覺有不覺，依不覺說有始覺。	As for establishing subsequent enlightenment, it means that based on original enlightenment there is non-enlightenment, and based on non-enlightenment it speaks of subsequent enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a14_7']	又以覺心源故名究竟覺，不覺心源故非究竟覺。	又以覺心源故名究竟覺，不覺心源故非究竟覺。	Moreover, because one awakens to the mind's source, it is called ultimate awakening. Not awakening to the mind's source is not ultimate awakening.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a15_12']	如凡夫人，前念不覺起於煩惱，後念制伏令不更生。	如凡夫人，前念不覺起於煩惱，後念制伏令不更生。	It is like ordinary people, who in the previous moment of thought give rise to afflictions without being aware, and in the subsequent moment of thought suppress them to prevent further arising.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a16_3']	此雖名覺，即是不覺。	此雖名覺，即是不覺。	Although this is called awakening, it is actually non-awakening.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a17_16']	如二乘人及初業菩薩，覺有念無念體相別異，以捨麁分別故名相似覺。	如二乘人及初業菩薩，覺有念無念體相別異，以捨麁分別故名相似覺。	It is like practitioners of the two vehicles and beginners in bodhisattva practice, who are aware that the essence and characteristics of thought and non-thought are separate and different. Because they abandon coarse discrimination, it is called similar awakening.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a19_4']	如法身菩薩，覺念無念皆無有相，捨中品分別故名隨分覺。	如法身菩薩，覺念無念皆無有相，捨中品分別故名隨分覺。	It is like bodhisattvas of the Dharma body, who are aware that both thought and non-thought are devoid of characteristics. Because they abandon middling discrimination, it is called partial awakening.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a20_10']	若超過菩薩地，究竟道滿足，一念相應覺心初起始名為覺。	若超過菩薩地，究竟道滿足，一念相應覺心初起始名為覺。	If one transcends the stage of bodhisattva and perfects the ultimate path, the moment of thought that accords with awakening is first called awakening.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a22_4']	遠離覺相微細分別究竟永盡，心根本性常住現前，是為如來，名究竟覺。	遠離覺相微細分別究竟永盡，心根本性常住現前，是為如來，名究竟覺。	Far removed from the subtle discrimination of the characteristics of awakening, ultimately extinguished, the fundamental nature of the mind is always present. This is the Tathāgata, called ultimate awakening.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a22_9']	是故經說：	是故經說：	Therefore, the sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a23_12']	若有眾生能觀一切妄念無相，則為證得如來智慧。	若有眾生能觀一切妄念無相，則為證得如來智慧。	If there are sentient beings who are able to contemplate that all false thoughts are without characteristics, then they will realize the wisdom of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a23_15']	又言：	又言：	It is also said:
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a24_13']	心初起者但隨俗說，求其初相終不可得。	心初起者但隨俗說，求其初相終不可得。	The initial arising of the mind is merely conventionally spoken of; if one seeks its initial characteristic, it can never be obtained.
['ZH_T32_1667_001:0585a25_3']	心尚無有，何況有初？	心尚無有，何況有初？	Since the mind does not even exist, how could there be an initial [arising]?
