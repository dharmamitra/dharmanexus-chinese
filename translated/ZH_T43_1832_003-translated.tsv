['ZH_T43_1832_003:0709c26_15']	由觀現法有酬前用。	由觀現法有酬前用。	Because we observe that present dharmas have a function of repaying a previous cause,

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0710a01_12']	然說樂受亦名壞苦。	然說樂受亦名壞苦。	However, it is said that pleasant feeling is also the suffering of change,
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0710a01_18']	謂壞時苦故。	謂壞時苦故。	Because it is suffering when it changes.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0710a02_13']	當必滅故說過去者。	當必滅故說過去者。	Because it will definitely cease in the future, it is said to be in the past.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0710a02_18']	此時顯故。	此時顯故。	Because at that time the present is manifest,
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0710a03_8']	異他宗故約世分故。	異他宗故約世分故。	Because it is different from other schools and because it is divided into time periods.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720b28_1']	此言俱有為因為果俱是現有。	此言俱有為因為果俱是現有。	The words being simultaneous with the cause means that the effect is simultaneously present.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720b29_1']	瑜伽簡他未生已滅為因之者故開為二。	瑜伽簡他未生已滅為因之者故開為二。	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra distinguishes those that are causes for others that have not yet arisen or have already ceased, so it expands them into two.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720b29_10']	此論據因同時為一。	此論據因同時為一。	This treatise takes the simultaneous causes as one.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c01_4']	故云雖因與果有俱不俱。	故云雖因與果有俱不俱。	Therefore it says, Although the cause may or may not be simultaneous with the effect,

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c10_6']	一無常法是因。	一無常法是因。	The first is that impermanent dharmas are causes.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c11_5']	亦簡真如受熏為種　要集云。	亦簡真如受熏為種　要集云。	It also excludes true suchness from being perfumed and becoming seeds. The Yaoshan Collection says:
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c11_14']	如雖受熏不為法因。	如雖受熏不為法因。	Although suchness is perfumed, it is not the cause of dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c12_10']	但所持種為法因故　此不識意。	但所持種為法因故　此不識意。	However, because the seeds it holds are the causes of dharmas, this does not understand the meaning.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c13_5']	此中攝持種子相應。	此中攝持種子相應。	Here, the seeds are held and associated.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c13_18']	謂有生法俱生俱滅故成熏習。	謂有生法俱生俱滅故成熏習。	It means that the produced dharmas are born together and cease together, thus becoming perfumed.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c15_9']	如是熏習攝持種子應正道理　真如常法不是持種故非法因。	如是熏習攝持種子應正道理　真如常法不是持種故非法因。	In this way, the perfuming holds the seeds, which is the correct principle. Because true suchness is a permanent dharma, it does not hold seeds, so it is not the cause of dharmas.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c18_4']	本疏三義名現　西明云。	本疏三義名現　西明云。	The original commentary has three meanings for present. Ximing says:
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c18_18']	種與現行果俱在現在故名為現。	種與現行果俱在現在故名為現。	Because the seeds and the present functioning fruit exist together in the present, it is called present.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c22_11']	亦破初說　有云二義。	亦破初說　有云二義。	It also refutes the first explanation. Some say there are two meanings:

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c25_1']	有釋．有云於理為勝　今謂有釋不簡假法如有解破。	有釋．有云於理為勝　今謂有釋不簡假法如有解破。	Some explain, some say it is superior in principle. Now it is said that some explanations do not distinguish hypothetical dharmas, as if there were an understanding to refute.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c25_15']	若云護法宗假法如無非因緣故。	若云護法宗假法如無非因緣故。	If it is said that in the school of Dharmapāla, hypothetical dharmas are like non-existent, because they are not causes and conditions,
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c26_10']	不相應行假實門簡故此不遮。	不相應行假實門簡故此不遮。	because the gate of distinguishing the hypothetical and real among the non-associated activities excludes this, it does not block it.🔽It should also be said that the eternal dharmas and the various evolving consciousnesses do not need to be blocked or distinguished.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0720c29_11']	云親生自果即引自果。	云親生自果即引自果。	It is said that that which directly produces its own result is that which attracts its own result.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0721a01_4']	既云及所生果不一不異。	既云及所生果不一不異。	Since it is said that the result that is produced is neither the same nor different,
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0721a01_13']	即與果俱後何須簡。	即與果俱後何須簡。	then why is it necessary to distinguish later on that it is simultaneous with the result?
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0721a02_4']	故諸門中具義多少。	故諸門中具義多少。	Therefore, in the various gates, the amount of meaning is complete.🔽It is also necessary to distinguish the hypothetical.

['ZH_T43_1832_003:0721a05_12']	故於此中但簡前後若種若現。	故於此中但簡前後若種若現。	Therefore, in this, only the past and future, whether seeds or manifestations, are distinguished.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0721a06_13']	及他相離無和合者　此亦不得疏之本意。	及他相離無和合者　此亦不得疏之本意。	And that which is separated from others and has no combination - this also does not get the original meaning of the commentary.
['ZH_T43_1832_003:0721a07_9']	以無性人第七恒轉亦具七義。	以無性人第七恒轉亦具七義。	Because for those without nature, the seventh always turns and also has the seven meanings.
