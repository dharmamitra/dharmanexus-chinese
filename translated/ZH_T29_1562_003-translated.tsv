Even though there is no movement in the case of arising in a series with different objects, still it is said that the experiencer experiences, because it is able to experience objects.

['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b17_2']	論曰：	論曰：	003	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b18_5']	如五識界，別有眼等五界為依，第六意識無別所依。	如五識界，別有眼等五界為依，第六意識無別所依。	003	Just as the five consciousnesses have separate eyes, etc., as supports for the five elements, the sixth consciousness, i.e., mental consciousness, has no separate support.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b19_4']	如離所緣識無起義，離依亦爾，識不得生。	如離所緣識無起義，離依亦爾，識不得生。	003	Just as there is no meaning for consciousness to arise apart from its object, the same is true of its support. Consciousness cannot arise without a support.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b19_14']	為成此依，故說意界。	為成此依，故說意界。	003	In order to establish this support, the mind element is spoken of.

['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b21_2']	如何已滅名現識依？	如何已滅名現識依？	003	How can that which has already perished be called the support of present consciousness?
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b21_12']	是現識生，隣近緣故。	是現識生，隣近緣故。	003	Because it is a proximate condition for the arising of present consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b22_6']	如雖有色而要依眼，眼識得生。	如雖有色而要依眼，眼識得生。	003	Although there is form, eye consciousness can only be produced in dependence on the eye.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b23_8']	如是雖有所緣境界而後識生，要依前念無間滅意。	如是雖有所緣境界而後識生，要依前念無間滅意。	003	In the same way, although there is an object-support, a subsequent consciousness can only be produced in dependence on a previous moment of mind that has just ceased.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b24_16']	是故前言無間滅者，為遮前念有間滅心，雖先聞避而未生故。	是故前言無間滅者，為遮前念有間滅心，雖先聞避而未生故。	003	Therefore, the previous statement that the mind that has just ceased is the manas is in order to exclude the mind of the previous moment that has ceased with an interval, because although it has been heard, it has not yet been produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b25_16']	由此無間已滅六識，為現識依，說為意界。	由此無間已滅六識，為現識依，說為意界。	003	On the basis of this, the six consciousnesses that have just ceased without interval are the support of the present consciousness and are called the mind sense base.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b27_4']	或現在識正成依用，過去已成等無間緣，亦於現在能取果故。	或現在識正成依用，過去已成等無間緣，亦於現在能取果故。	003	Or, the present consciousness is in the process of accomplishing the function of support, and the past [consciousness] has already become the condition as cause, and it is also able to take a result in the present.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b28_12']	雖依彼生而非隨彼，故心依心不名心所，心所品類必隨心故。	雖依彼生而非隨彼，故心依心不名心所，心所品類必隨心故。	003	Although it is produced in dependence on that, it is not said to be a mental activity because it is not necessarily of the same kind as the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342b29_2']	已釋諸蘊取蘊處界。	已釋諸蘊取蘊處界。	003	The aggregates, the appropriated aggregates, the sense bases, and the elements have been explained.

['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c02_10']	五蘊、無為，名一切法。	五蘊、無為，名一切法。	003	The five aggregates and unconditioned dharmas are called all dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c02_20']	別攝如是，應辯總攝。	別攝如是，應辯總攝。	003	The specific inclusion is like this. We should now discuss the general inclusion.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c03_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	003	A verse says:

['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c05_13']	攝自性非餘，　　以離他性故。	攝自性非餘，　　以離他性故。	003	They include their own nature, not others, because they are apart from the nature of others.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c06_2']	論曰：	論曰：	003	The treatise says:

['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c07_11']	總是集義。	總是集義。	003	Generally means the meaning of collection.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c08_6']	置總言者，令知總三，勿謂各一。	置總言者，令知總三，勿謂各一。	003	The word generally is used to let people know that there are three generally included dharmas, not just one each.

['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c11_1']	且如說三蘊攝八支聖道，若攝自性，慧蘊唯應攝於正見，非正思惟及正精進；	且如說三蘊攝八支聖道，若攝自性，慧蘊唯應攝於正見，非正思惟及正精進；	003	For example, it is said that the three aggregates include the eight factors of the noble path. If they only included their own nature, the aggregate of wisdom would only include right view, not right thought and right effort;

['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c12_13']	既契經中不如是說，故知諸法唯攝他性。	既契經中不如是說，故知諸法唯攝他性。	003	Since the sutras do not say it this way, we know that dharmas only include the nature of others.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c13_3']	此執不然，無定因故。	此執不然，無定因故。	003	This interpretation is not correct, because there is no fixed reason.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c15_1']	若攝他性，何因決定慧蘊唯能攝正思惟及正精進，不攝正念及與正定或所餘法。	若攝他性，何因決定慧蘊唯能攝正思惟及正精進，不攝正念及與正定或所餘法。	003	If it includes other natures, what is the fixed reason that the aggregate of discernment only includes correct thought and correct effort, and does not include correct mindfulness and correct meditation, or other dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c16_17']	若言此攝，亦有定因，謂正思惟及正精進，其性猛銳相涉般若念定等法，慧相相違；	若言此攝，亦有定因，謂正思惟及正精進，其性猛銳相涉般若念定等法，慧相相違；	003	If it is said that this inclusion also has a fixed reason, namely that correct thought and correct effort are by nature vigorous and can include the dharmas of discernment, mindfulness, meditation, etc., but are incompatible with the characteristic of discernment;
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c17_8']	念涉定相，非思惟等。	念涉定相，非思惟等。	003	mindfulness includes meditation, but is not the same as thought, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c18_6']	若爾，便成唯攝自性，由不許攝異相法故。	若爾，便成唯攝自性，由不許攝異相法故。	003	In that case, it would only include its own nature, because it does not include dharmas with different characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c19_14']	諸法相望無非異相，若片相似許相攝者，應許一切攝一切法。	諸法相望無非異相，若片相似許相攝者，應許一切攝一切法。	003	All dharmas, when compared with each other, have no characteristics that are not different. If it is allowed that they are included when they resemble each other to some extent, then all dharmas should be allowed to include all dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c20_13']	豈不如與他性相應，而非一切一切相應。	豈不如與他性相應，而非一切一切相應。	003	Why is it not the case that, just as they are associated with other natures, not all are associated with everything?
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c21_12']	如是應許他性相攝，而非一切一切相攝。	如是應許他性相攝，而非一切一切相攝。	003	In the same way, it should be allowed that other natures are included, but not that all are included in everything.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c23_14']	此不應例，夫相應者唯有緣法，異體相望共一緣轉，時依行相品類等同，此說相應故非一切。	此不應例，夫相應者唯有緣法，異體相望共一緣轉，時依行相品類等同，此說相應故非一切。	003	This is not a proper analogy. Associates are only dharmas that have objects, and they are mutually similar in that they are associated with the same object, the same time, the same support, the same aspect, the same class, and so on. This is the meaning of association, and not all dharmas are associates.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c24_18']	其相攝者通一切法，有何定因，此唯攝彼不攝餘法？	其相攝者通一切法，有何定因，此唯攝彼不攝餘法？	003	As for the meaning of inclusion, it is common to all dharmas. What is the definite reason that only this includes that and does not include other dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c25_7']	故應一切攝一切法。	故應一切攝一切法。	003	Therefore, all dharmas should include all dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_003:0342c26_15']	以諸色法及不相應展轉相望，無一緣等互相似義可不相應；	以諸色法及不相應展轉相望，無一緣等互相似義可不相應；	003	Because the various material dharmas and the dharmas not directly associated with mind are mutually dissimilar in that they do not have the same object, and so on. Therefore, they are not associates.
