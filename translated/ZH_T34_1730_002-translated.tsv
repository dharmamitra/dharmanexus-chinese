It is only in order to avoid the extreme of superimposition that it is provisionally said to be non-arising, because one does not give rise to a mind of arising in what arises nor a mind of non-arising in what does not arise;

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973b29_8']	然心王之義略有二種：	然心王之義略有二種：	There are roughly two meanings of the term mind king:
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c01_5']	一者八識之心御諸心數故名心王；	一者八識之心御諸心數故名心王；	First, the mind of the eight consciousnesses controls the various mental factors, thus it is called the mind king;
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c02_2']	二者一心之法總御眾德故名心王。	二者一心之法總御眾德故名心王。	Second, the dharma of the one mind universally controls the various virtues, thus it is called the mind king.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c03_5']	今此菩薩入無生行證一心王，故從所體以立名也。	今此菩薩入無生行證一心王，故從所體以立名也。	Now, this bodhisattva enters the practice of non-arising and realizes the One Mind King, and therefore he is named based on his essence.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c04_4']	今此品中明無生行，所以心王菩薩發問。	今此品中明無生行，所以心王菩薩發問。	In this chapter, it clarifies the practice of non-arising, and therefore Bodhisattva Mind King asks about it.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c05_8']	出三界外不可思議者，是出所聞之法以為發問之本。	出三界外不可思議者，是出所聞之法以為發問之本。	Beyond the three realms, inconceivable refers to the Dharma that is heard and serves as the basis for asking questions.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c12_12']	後一頌正發問。	後一頌正發問。	The latter verse is the actual question.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c13_20']	既無有生，應無忍心故。	既無有生，應無忍心故。	Since there is no arising, there should be no mind of acceptance.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c16_2']	得無生忍，即為虛妄。	得無生忍，即為虛妄。	Attaining the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas is itself false.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c16_16']	答意有二：	答意有二：	The meaning of the answer is twofold:
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c17_9']	先示無生忍相、後顯有得過失。	先示無生忍相、後顯有得過失。	First, it shows the characteristics of the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, and second, it reveals the fault of attainment.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c19_9']	無生法忍者，達法本無生，是則定慧諸行亦無有生，非於無生有能忍行，故言非無生行。	無生法忍者，達法本無生，是則定慧諸行亦無有生，非於無生有能忍行，故言非無生行。	The acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas means penetrating that dharmas are originally unborn. This means that samādhi and prajñā activities are also unborn. It is not that within non-arising there is an activity of acceptance, therefore it says not non-arising activities.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c20_14']	於中有得能忍之行，則乖真忍無住無行，故言即為虛妄。	於中有得能忍之行，則乖真忍無住無行，故言即為虛妄。	Within this, if one attains the practice of forbearance, then it contradicts true forbearance, which is without abiding and without practice, and therefore it is said to be false.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c24_9']	若謂有得有忍是虛妄者，則謂無得無忍應非虛妄，反虛妄故。	若謂有得有忍是虛妄者，則謂無得無忍應非虛妄，反虛妄故。	If it is said that attaining and having forbearance are false, then it is said that not attaining and not having forbearance should not be false, because it is the opposite of false.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c25_8']	諸學大乘無所得者作如是計，自謂非妄。	諸學大乘無所得者作如是計，自謂非妄。	Those who study the Mahāyāna and do not attain anything make this kind of calculation, thinking that they themselves are not false.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0973c25_18']	為顯彼妄，故作是難。	為顯彼妄，故作是難。	In order to reveal their falsity, this objection is made.🔽The sūtra says:

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a02_3']	若彼意謂無得無忍，則雖不得有得有忍之有，而猶得其無得無忍之無。	若彼意謂無得無忍，則雖不得有得有忍之有，而猶得其無得無忍之無。	If the other party thinks there is no attainment and no patience, then even though there is no attainment of attainment and patience, there is still the non-existence of non-attainment and non-patience.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a02_15']	既得於無者，則心住於無。	既得於無者，則心住於無。	Since there is attainment of non-existence, the mind abides in non-existence.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a14_19']	初言無忍無生心者，是牒正在法忍之心。	初言無忍無生心者，是牒正在法忍之心。	The first says the mind of no patience and no birth, this is a restatement of the mind in the patience of Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a15_12']	言心無形段者，顯心無所得。	言心無形段者，顯心無所得。	The mind has no form or substance reveals the mind has nothing to attain.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a17_1']	形之言體、段之言分，就諸緣中求心體分，若即若離皆無所得。	形之言體、段之言分，就諸緣中求心體分，若即若離皆無所得。	Form means essence, substance means parts. Seeking the essence and parts of the mind within various conditions, whether identical or separate, all have nothing to attain.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a17_19']	由是道理故無形段，非謂無色形段相也。	由是道理故無形段，非謂無色形段相也。	For this reason, there is no form or substance, but it is not that there is no form or substance of the appearance of form.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a20_4']	其在無所者，就此木中有諸極微，於中都無火性所在。	其在無所者，就此木中有諸極微，於中都無火性所在。	it is not present anywhere. In this wood, there are many extremely subtle particles, and within them, the nature of fire is completely absent.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a21_4']	如是理中有恒沙法門，於中求心永無所在。	如是理中有恒沙法門，於中求心永無所在。	In this way, within the principles, there are countless Dharma gates, and when seeking the mind, it is permanently absent.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a22_10']	如是火性無處道理，有佛無佛法性常爾，故言決定性故。	如是火性無處道理，有佛無佛法性常爾，故言決定性故。	In this way, the principle of the absence of a location for the nature of fire is such that whether there are Buddhas or not, the nature of dharmas is always thus, and therefore it is said because of the definitive nature.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a22_19']	火性名下義不可得。	火性名下義不可得。	The meaning of the name nature of fire cannot be obtained.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a25_6']	推析此名但有諸字，轉求諸字皆無所得。	推析此名但有諸字，轉求諸字皆無所得。	Analyzing this name, it is only the various characters. Continuously seeking the various characters, all are unobtainable.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a26_5']	忍心名相當知亦爾，故次合言心相亦爾。	忍心名相當知亦爾，故次合言心相亦爾。	The corresponding name of the mind of endurance should also be understood in this way. Therefore, the following combines it and says the appearance of the mind is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a27_4']	得忍菩薩知心如是，何得於中能取心生？	得忍菩薩知心如是，何得於中能取心生？	Bodhisattvas who have attained acceptance understand the mind to be like this. How can they grasp at the arising of the mind within it?
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974a27_13']	以之故言則無生心。	以之故言則無生心。	For this reason, it is said that there is no arising of the mind.

Since there is no time of stopping, there is no effort. Because there is no effort, they both do not produce results.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974b17_7']	如偈說言「諸行皆剎那，住尚無況用。	如偈說言「諸行皆剎那，住尚無況用。	As a verse says, All conditioned phenomena are momentary. There is no abiding, let alone function.

Since there is no arising, there is no cessation. Therefore, it is said that dependent arising is not arising, and the passing of conditions is not cessation. Thus, seeking in this way, both concealment and manifestation are non-existent.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974b20_12']	隱者，種子在土下故。	隱者，種子在土下故。	Concealment means that the seeds are below the soil.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974b28_18']	菓種不一，其相不同故。	菓種不一，其相不同故。	The fruit and seed are not the same, their characteristics are different, therefore.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c02_12']	菓不出種，種時無菓故。	菓不出種，種時無菓故。	The fruit does not emerge from the seed, because at the time of the seed there is no fruit, therefore.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c03_7']	不入不出故不生，不常不斷故不滅。	不入不出故不生，不常不斷故不滅。	Because it does not enter or emerge, it does not arise. Because it is not eternal or annihilated, it does not cease.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c04_4']	不滅故不可說無，不生故不可說有。	不滅故不可說無，不生故不可說有。	Because it is not extinguished, it cannot be said to be nonexistent. Because it is not produced, it cannot be said to be existent.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c05_13']	不當一中，故不可說非有非無。	不當一中，故不可說非有非無。	Because it should not be confined to one, it cannot be said to be neither existent nor nonexistent.

The mind of acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas is also not different from this, so it is said that the nature of the mind of non-arising is also like this and so forth.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c13_8']	直是妄執，能障菩提及其般若，是明不得性淨菩提、能證般若。	直是妄執，能障菩提及其般若，是明不得性淨菩提、能證般若。	It is just false grasping, which can obstruct bodhi and prajñā. This clarifies that one does not attain the intrinsically pure bodhi and the prajñā that can be realized.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c13_18']	又菩提者，始起菩提。	又菩提者，始起菩提。	Moreover, bodhi is the initial arising of bodhi.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c14_7']	言般若者，菩提之因。	言般若者，菩提之因。	As for prajñā, it is the cause of bodhi.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c20_14']	無漏智生，通達聖諦故。	無漏智生，通達聖諦故。	The uncontaminated wisdom arises and penetrates the holy truth.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c21_9']	」知心性如者，知自觀心體性平等故。	」知心性如者，知自觀心體性平等故。	Knowing that the nature of the mind is thus means knowing that the essence of one's own observation of the mind is equal.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c23_15']	如是觀心體用平等，無生無滅、無始無終，以之故言是無生行。	如是觀心體用平等，無生無滅、無始無終，以之故言是無生行。	Thus, observing the mind's essence and function as equal, unborn, unceasing, beginningless, and endless, it is called the practice of non-arising.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c27_18']	在聖之行與理一味，遍通之理與智平等，平等一味故聖人所不能異也，有通有別故聖人所不能同也。	在聖之行與理一味，遍通之理與智平等，平等一味故聖人所不能異也，有通有別故聖人所不能同也。	The practice of sages is of one flavor with principle, and the principle that pervades everywhere is equal to wisdom. Because of the equal flavor, sages cannot make distinctions. Because there are commonalities and differences, sages cannot make sameness.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0974c29_1']	不能同者即同而異也，不能異者即異而同也。	不能同者即同而異也，不能異者即異而同也。	Not being able to make sameness means being different within sameness, and not being able to make distinctions means being the same within differences.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0975a02_1']	同者辨同於異、異者明異於同，明異於同者非分同為異也，辨同於異者非銷異為同也。	同者辨同於異、異者明異於同，明異於同者非分同為異也，辨同於異者非銷異為同也。	Clarifying sameness within differences does not mean dividing differences into sameness, and discerning sameness within differences does not mean dissolving differences into sameness.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0975a04_13']	良由同非銷異故不可說是同，異非分同故不可說是異，但以不可說異故可得說是同，不可說同故可得說是異耳。	良由同非銷異故不可說是同，異非分同故不可說是異，但以不可說異故可得說是同，不可說同故可得說是異耳。	It is precisely because sameness is not eliminated in difference that it cannot be said to be the same. Difference is not divided into sameness, so it cannot be said to be different. But it is precisely because it cannot be said to be different that it can be said to be the same. It is precisely because it cannot be said to be the same that it can be said to be different.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a10_17']	亦如是者，空寂之理同前出世心之無生故。	亦如是者，空寂之理同前出世心之無生故。	Also like this means the principle of emptiness and quiescence is the same as the non-arising of the mind of the supramundane.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a11_8']	何以故下，第二廣釋。	何以故下，第二廣釋。	Why is it so? is the second extensive explanation.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a11_13']	眼者眼根。	眼者眼根。	Eye refers to the eye faculty.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a12_7']	眼觸即是遍行中觸，依三和生。	眼觸即是遍行中觸，依三和生。	Eye contact is the contact among the universal mental factors, which arises based on the union of the three.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a13_1']	令三和合，欲明散空，故偏舉之。	令三和合，欲明散空，故偏舉之。	It causes the three to unite, wanting to clarify the emptiness of dispersion, thus it is mentioned specifically.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a13_17']	識亦空者，眼觸既空，眼識不生故。	識亦空者，眼觸既空，眼識不生故。	Consciousness is also empty means that since eye contact is empty, eye consciousness does not arise.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a14_19']	無有相續遷動，亦無剎那不遷故，言無有動不動相。	無有相續遷動，亦無剎那不遷故，言無有動不動相。	There is no continuity or change, nor is there a moment that does not change, therefore it is said there are no characteristics of movement or stillness.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a15_16']	言內無三受者，三受生起本來寂滅故。	言內無三受者，三受生起本來寂滅故。	As for internally there are no three feelings, the arising of the three feelings is originally quiescent and extinguished.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a17_2']	諸心數中觸受相近，有大勝能，故舉此二通遣餘法也。	諸心數中觸受相近，有大勝能，故舉此二通遣餘法也。	Among the mental factors, contact and feeling are closely related and have great power, therefore mentioning these two generally eliminates the other dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a17_19']	耳鼻舌身者，謂耳、耳觸、耳識等也。	耳鼻舌身者，謂耳、耳觸、耳識等也。	Ear, nose, tongue, and body refers to the ear, ear contact, ear consciousness, and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a20_1']	心意意識者，是第六識，未來名心、過去名意、現名意識，依隨轉門舉此三名，為顯三世皆空寂故。	心意意識者，是第六識，未來名心、過去名意、現名意識，依隨轉門舉此三名，為顯三世皆空寂故。	Mind, thought, and consciousness is the sixth consciousness. The future is called mind, the past is called thought, and the present is called consciousness. Following the doctrine of dependent arising, these three names are mentioned to show that the three times are all empty and quiescent.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a21_1']	末那、梨耶，第七第八，皆同眼識，故亦不生也。	末那、梨耶，第七第八，皆同眼識，故亦不生也。	The seventh and eighth consciousnesses, i.e., manas and ālaya, are the same as the eye consciousness, therefore they are also unborn.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a21_6', 'ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a22_2']	廣釋文竟。🔽次言寂滅心者，近結八識空寂之文。	廣釋文竟。 次言寂滅心者，近結八識空寂之文。	The extensive explanation of the text is finished.🔽Next, the mind of quiescent extinction is a close conclusion to the text on the emptiness and quiescence of the eight consciousnesses.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a22_17']	及無生心者，遠結體寂無生之文。	及無生心者，遠結體寂無生之文。	The mind of non-arising is a distant conclusion to the text on the quiescent and unborn essence.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a24_13']	經曰　「若生寂滅心、若生無生心，是有生行、非無生行，內生三受、三行、三戒。	經曰　「若生寂滅心、若生無生心，是有生行、非無生行，內生三受、三行、三戒。	The sūtra says: If one gives rise to the mind of quiescent extinction or the mind of non-arising, this is a practice with arising, not a practice without arising. Internally, one gives rise to three feelings, three practices, and three precepts.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a25_1']	此是第二舉非。	此是第二舉非。	This is the second point of non-compliance.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a26_6']	謂有所得大乘學者，不空八識違其寂滅，故言生寂滅心。	謂有所得大乘學者，不空八識違其寂滅，故言生寂滅心。	It refers to those who study the Mahāyāna with something to attain. Since the eight consciousnesses are not empty, they go against quiescent extinction, so it says giving rise to the mind of quiescent extinction.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a27_12']	不知出世心之無生，謂有心生證無相理，故言生無生心。	不知出世心之無生，謂有心生證無相理，故言生無生心。	Not knowing that the mind beyond the world is unborn, they think that there is a mind that gives rise to the realization of the principle of no characteristics, so it says giving rise to the mind of non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a29_1']	直是世間流轉之行，而乖出世無生忍行，故言是有生行等也。	直是世間流轉之行，而乖出世無生忍行，故言是有生行等也。	This is simply the practice of worldly transmigration, which goes against the practice of acquiescing to non-arising beyond the world, so it says this is a practice with arising, etc.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976a29_16']	言三行者，身口意作，通善不善。	言三行者，身口意作，通善不善。	As for the three practices, they are the wholesome and unwholesome actions of body, speech, and mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b01_9']	言三戒者，身口意止，唯取其善。	言三戒者，身口意止，唯取其善。	As for the three precepts, they are the wholesome abstentions of body, speech, and mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b02_17']	生此三行三戒為因，而生三有，具受三受，如是流轉不得解脫。	生此三行三戒為因，而生三有，具受三受，如是流轉不得解脫。	Giving rise to these three practices and three precepts as causes, one gives rise to the three existences and fully experiences the three feelings. Transmigrating in this way, one does not attain liberation.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b06_9']	經曰　「若寂滅生心不生，心常寂滅無功無用，不證寂滅相，亦不住於無證，可處無住、總持無相，即無三受等三，悉皆寂滅、清淨無住，不入三昧、不住坐禪，無生無行。	經曰　「若寂滅生心不生，心常寂滅無功無用，不證寂滅相，亦不住於無證，可處無住、總持無相，即無三受等三，悉皆寂滅、清淨無住，不入三昧、不住坐禪，無生無行。	The sūtra says: If the mind of quiescent extinction arises, the mind does not arise. The mind is always quiescent and extinguished, without function or purpose. It does not realize the characteristics of quiescent extinction, and also does not abide in non-realization. It can abide in non-abiding, universally maintain the markless, and be without the three feelings and so forth, all of which are completely extinguished, pure and non-abiding. It does not enter samādhi, does not abide in sitting meditation, is without arising and without practice.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b10_8']	心常寂滅無功無用者，反前若生無生心句，離諸生滅起動之相，亦無作意分別功用故。	心常寂滅無功無用者，反前若生無生心句，離諸生滅起動之相，亦無作意分別功用故。	The mind is always quiescent and extinguished, without function or purpose reverses the previous phrase if the mind of non-arising arises, being apart from all characteristics of arising and ceasing agitation, and also being without the function of intentional discrimination.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b13_15']	可處無住者，總明離住著過，諸可住處皆無所住故。	可處無住者，總明離住著過，諸可住處皆無所住故。	The abode of non-abiding, generally clarifying the fault of separation from attachment, because there is no abiding in all abodes.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b15_11']	可住處者，若遣生起則可住寂滅、若遣有證則可住無證，如是可處皆無住故。	可住處者，若遣生起則可住寂滅、若遣有證則可住無證，如是可處皆無住故。	The abode is that if one dismisses arising, then one can abide in quiescent extinction; if one dismisses realization, then one can abide in non-realization. In this way, because there is no abiding in all abodes,
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b17_3']	總持無相者，總顯具功德，謂無生心持諸行德而同一味無差別相故。	總持無相者，總顯具功德，謂無生心持諸行德而同一味無差別相故。	The total retention of the signless generally reveals the possession of merit, that is, because the mind of non-arising retains the merit of all practices and has the same flavor without the characteristic of discrimination.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b18_10']	則無三受等三者，反前內生三受等句，遠離流轉因果相故。	則無三受等三者，反前內生三受等句，遠離流轉因果相故。	Then there are no three feelings, etc., the three sentences of internal arising of feelings, etc., are reversed, because they are far removed from the characteristics of the causes and effects of saṃsāra.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b19_5']	悉皆寂滅者，達三受等本來空故。	悉皆寂滅者，達三受等本來空故。	All are completely extinguished, because one penetrates that the three feelings, etc., are originally empty.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b20_16']	不入三昧者，能亡世間入定心故。	不入三昧者，能亡世間入定心故。	Not entering samādhi, because the mind that is able to forget the world and enter concentration is absent.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0976b21_11']	不住坐禪者，亦遣世間住禪靜故。	不住坐禪者，亦遣世間住禪靜故。	Not abiding in sitting meditation also means to transcend worldly dwelling in meditation and stillness.

Why does the mind of no birth and no practice in the world not also enter and abide in meditative absorption?

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0979b23_18']	既無出入，不在空有，故言心處無在。	既無出入，不在空有，故言心處無在。	Since there is no coming or going, it is not in emptiness or existence, and therefore it is said that the mind's abode is nowhere.

The perfect completion of initial enlightenment is the same as fundamental enlightenment. The fundamental and initial are non-dual, so it is called the one enlightenment. Since there is nothing it does not do, it is called the holy power.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0979c19_17']	一覺之內俱四大智持諸功德，故言智地。	一覺之內俱四大智持諸功德，故言智地。	Within the one enlightenment, there are all four great wisdoms that uphold all merits, so it is called the wisdom ground.

Sometimes they are gathered due to being associated with afflictions, and sometimes they are alone due to the mind's activities being apart from delusion. Even when apart from afflictions, there is still conceptualization grasping at dharmas, and when together with afflictions, one is still tainted by afflictions.

It means relying on the Buddha's sūtras to turn the mind and spirit, to send away the characteristics of persons and dharmas, and to abide in the principle of the two emptinesses.

Therefore, it is said that one sits alone in the open.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0980a25_15']	言果果者，以無上覺證大涅槃，覺知無覺諸識皆入，故言識陰般涅槃也。	言果果者，以無上覺證大涅槃，覺知無覺諸識皆入，故言識陰般涅槃也。	As for the fruition of the fruition, with supreme enlightenment one realizes great nirvāṇa. One awakens to the non-awakening of all consciousnesses and enters them all. Therefore, it is said that the aggregate of consciousness enters parinirvāṇa.

This clarifies that nirvana is the benefit of fundamental enlightenment, and this benefit of fundamental enlightenment is the fundamental nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0980b20_17']	其始覺者即同本覺，所以無異，故無得也。	其始覺者即同本覺，所以無異，故無得也。	The initial enlightenment is the same as the fundamental enlightenment, so there is no difference, and therefore no attainment.

This means that in the first emptiness, the conventional revealed by emptiness is emptied, and in the second emptiness, the truth revealed by emptiness is emptied. Since these two are not two, it says also empty. This merges the one truth and reveals the one dharma realm. The one dharma realm is precisely the one mind.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988a03_11']	初解脫者，內有色相外觀色等，謂內存色等五陰法相，觀內我空；	初解脫者，內有色相外觀色等，謂內存色等五陰法相，觀內我空；	The first liberation is internally having the characteristics of form and externally observing form, etc., meaning internally retaining the characteristics of the five aggregates of dharmas, observing the emptiness of the internal self;
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988a04_1']	外存色等，觀眾生空。	外存色等，觀眾生空。	Externally, one observes the emptiness of sentient beings, with form and so forth existing externally.

Therefore, it is said that the wisdom of hearing attains the two aspects of internal and external, which cannot be obtained. Because form and so forth are not eliminated to observe emptiness, there is something similar to empty space that does not eliminate the characteristics of form. Therefore, it is said to be the liberation of empty space.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988a08_10']	第二解脫者，內無色相外觀色等，內遣色等五陰法相，外觀一切山河等空。	第二解脫者，內無色相外觀色等，內遣色等五陰法相，外觀一切山河等空。	As for the second liberation, internally there are no characteristics of form, and externally one observes form and so forth. Internally, one eliminates the characteristics of the five aggregates such as form, and externally one observes all mountains, rivers, and so forth as empty.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988a09_13']	欲界諸法無所不空，是空難解思慧所觀，故言思慧。	欲界諸法無所不空，是空難解思慧所觀，故言思慧。	The dharmas of the desire realm are all empty, and this emptiness is difficult to understand. It is observed through the wisdom of reflection. Therefore, it is said to be the wisdom of reflection.

Contemplating the dharmas of the concentration of cessation as also unobtainable is called the liberation of the cessation of sensation and conceptualization.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988a20_10']	皆從所遣以立其名，故言四空，五陰及滅定觀皆不可得故。	皆從所遣以立其名，故言四空，五陰及滅定觀皆不可得故。	All are established based on what is sent away, and are therefore called the four formless liberations. Contemplating the five aggregates and the concentration of cessation as all unobtainable is the same.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988a22_2']	五解脫如相故，如是三慧觀人法空，伏離二執現行二縛，故名解脫。	五解脫如相故，如是三慧觀人法空，伏離二執現行二縛，故名解脫。	The five liberations are like the characteristics of suchness. In this way, the three kinds of wisdom contemplate the emptiness of persons and dharmas, and subdue and eliminate the two kinds of grasping and the two kinds of bonds that are presently active, and are therefore called liberation.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988c21_13']	三界空寂名涅槃宅，安心栖託之淨處故。	三界空寂名涅槃宅，安心栖託之淨處故。	The emptiness and tranquility of the three realms is called the house of nirvana, because the mind rests in the pure place of reliance.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988c23_4']	三解脫觀入三界空而不取證，還起俗心普化三界，故言心起三界。	三解脫觀入三界空而不取證，還起俗心普化三界，故言心起三界。	The contemplation of the three liberations enters the emptiness of the three realms and does not take realization, but still gives rise to the worldly mind and universally transforms the three realms, therefore it is said that the mind arises in the three realms.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988c23_18']	起三界心而不染著，即是存用。	起三界心而不染著，即是存用。	Giving rise to the mind of the three realms and yet not being attached, this is precisely preserving the function.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988c24_16']	著如來衣入法空處，即是守一心如之觀。	著如來衣入法空處，即是守一心如之觀。	Wearing the robe of the Tathāgata and entering the place of emptiness of dharmas, this is precisely the contemplation of guarding the suchness of the one mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0988c26_5']	謂涉三界普化之時，著忍辱衣而不疲倦，還入法空守一心如。	謂涉三界普化之時，著忍辱衣而不疲倦，還入法空守一心如。	That is to say, when traversing the three realms and universally transforming, wearing the robe of forbearance and not being weary, one returns to enter the emptiness of dharmas and guards the suchness of the one mind.

In that empty ocean of the one ground, they are like someone who has drunk alcohol and is intoxicated and not sober, and for many eons they still do not awaken.

Where wisdom and mind are extinguished, the essence of the samādhi of cessation arises, blocking mind and mental factors. This is called attaining the body of samādhi.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0989a16_12']	樂寂熏習在本識中，因是不悟空海一地。	樂寂熏習在本識中，因是不悟空海一地。	The habitual tendencies of delighting in quiescence are present in the fundamental consciousness, and due to this, one does not realize the ocean of emptiness, the one ground.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0989a19_17']	如得酒病惛醉不醒乃至數劫猶不覺者，須陀洹人八萬劫住，乃至羅漢二萬劫住，辟支佛者十千劫住，住於涅槃而不覺悟，今總相說乃至數劫。	如得酒病惛醉不醒乃至數劫猶不覺者，須陀洹人八萬劫住，乃至羅漢二萬劫住，辟支佛者十千劫住，住於涅槃而不覺悟，今總相說乃至數劫。	Just as one who has drunk alcohol and is intoxicated and confused does not awaken, even for many eons, one who has attained the fruit of stream-entry abides for 80,000 eons, and one who has attained the fruit of arhatship abides for 20,000 eons, and one who has attained the fruit of pratyekabuddha abides for 10,000 eons, abiding in nirvāṇa without realizing it.

According to the thickness of the habitual tendencies of attachment, when the intoxicating effect of attachment is dissipated and one regains consciousness, one's mind arises again. When the mind arises, one turns one's mind and enters the Great Vehicle, and then cultivates the three kinds of contemplative practices as explained above.

In the place of the practice stage, with a single thought of pure mind, he is determined and clear, with the power of vajra wisdom, irreversible, delivering sentient beings with compassion that is inexhaustible.

['ZH_T34_1730_002:0989b01_2']	於修行地之所即發一念淨心，即是十住之初發心。	於修行地之所即發一念淨心，即是十住之初發心。	In the place of the practice stage, he immediately gives rise to a single thought of pure mind, which is the initial generation of the resolve in the ten abodes.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0989b01_18']	決定明白者，謂十行位眾行明淨故。	決定明白者，謂十行位眾行明淨故。	Determined and clear means that in the stage of the ten practices, the myriad practices are clear and pure.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0989b02_14']	金剛智力者，謂十迴向堅固智力故。	金剛智力者，謂十迴向堅固智力故。	The power of vajra wisdom means that in the ten dedications, the power of firm wisdom is unshakable.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0989b03_12']	阿鞞跋致者，謂初地已上真證無退故。	阿鞞跋致者，謂初地已上真證無退故。	Non-retrogression refers to the stage of true realization above the first ground, because there is no retrogression.
['ZH_T34_1730_002:0989b05_2']	度脫眾生慈悲無盡者，即於前位利他行故，為別二乘不能行故。	度脫眾生慈悲無盡者，即於前位利他行故，為別二乘不能行故。	Liberating sentient beings with inexhaustible compassion means the practice of benefiting others in the previous stages, because it distinguishes from the two vehicles that are unable to practice.

The nature of precepts is equal to emptiness, and the upholder is deluded and inverted.

Without leaving the three buddhas, one gives rise to bodhi. Within the three signlessnesses, one follows the mind and profoundly enters.
