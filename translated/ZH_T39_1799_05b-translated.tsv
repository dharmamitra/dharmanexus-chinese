Therefore, the verse of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi says: When at that time there is nothing to be attained in the object, then one abides in mere consciousness, because one is free from the characteristics of the two graspings.
['ZH_T39_1799_05b:0902a26_11']	」當爾之時方名親證，乃至盡空如來國土淨穢、有無，皆是我心變化所現，故五位中名通達位也。	」當爾之時方名親證，乃至盡空如來國土淨穢、有無，皆是我心變化所現，故五位中名通達位也。	05b	At that time, it is called direct realization. Even the pure and impure, existence and non-existence of the lands of the Tathāgatas throughout empty space, are all manifestations created by the transformations of my mind. Therefore, among the five stages, it is called the stage of penetrating understanding.

Therefore, immeasurable Buddhas emerge from the nature of consciousness.

I contemplate that in the ten directions it is only consciousness. The conscious mind is perfectly clear and enters the perfectly accomplished nature, far away from the dependent and the universal grasping, and attains the acceptance of non-arising. This is foremost.

This is precisely not giving rise to false universal grasping, grasping the self and dharmas, which is precisely being free from the universal grasping.
['ZH_T39_1799_05b:0902b08_18']	決了能變、所變元是菩提妙覺明性，即離依他，唯一圓成清淨寶覺，故云遠離依他及遍計執。	決了能變、所變元是菩提妙覺明性，即離依他，唯一圓成清淨寶覺，故云遠離依他及遍計執。	05b	Having decisively understood that the transforming and transformed are originally the wondrous enlightened mind-nature, one is immediately free from the dependent nature, and there is only the perfect nature of pure precious enlightenment. Therefore, it is said that one is far removed from the dependent nature and the imagined nature.
['ZH_T39_1799_05b:0902b10_9']	故《唯識》云「初即相無性，次無自然性，後由遠離前，所執我、法性。	故《唯識》云「初即相無性，次無自然性，後由遠離前，所執我、法性。	05b	Therefore, the Vijñaptimātratā Sūtra says, The first is the nature of the absence of characteristics, the next is the nature of the absence of naturalness, and the last is due to being far removed from the previously grasped natures of self and dharmas.
