['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360b22_11']	我執依止故，假說心為我。	我執依止故，假說心為我。	Because it is the basis for the grasping of self, the mind is metaphorically called self.

['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360b27_3']	眼等為此所依親近，故說名內；	眼等為此所依親近，故說名內；	The eyes and so on are called internal because they are the proximate supports for the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360b27_17']	色等為此所緣疎遠，故名為外。	色等為此所緣疎遠，故名為外。	Form and so on are called external because they are the objects of the mind and are more remote.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360b28_16']	若爾，六識應不名內，未至意位，非心依故。	若爾，六識應不名內，未至意位，非心依故。	If this is so, then the six consciousnesses should not be called internal, because prior to becoming mental consciousness they are not the support for mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360b29_16']	至意位時不失六識界，未至意位亦非越意相。	至意位時不失六識界，未至意位亦非越意相。	But when they become mental consciousness, they do not lose the nature of the six consciousnesses, and prior to becoming mental consciousness they do not transcend the characteristics of mental consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c02_14']	若異此者，意界唯應在過去世，六識唯在現在未來，便違自宗許十八界皆通三世。	若異此者，意界唯應在過去世，六識唯在現在未來，便違自宗許十八界皆通三世。	If this were not so, then the realm of mental consciousness would exist only in the past, and the six consciousnesses would exist only in the present and future, and this would contradict the accepted doctrine that the eighteen realms are found in all three times.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c04_12']	又若未來現在六識無意界相，設至過去意界位中亦應不立，相於三世無改易故。	又若未來現在六識無意界相，設至過去意界位中亦應不立，相於三世無改易故。	Also, if the six consciousnesses of the present and future do not have the nature of the realm of mental consciousness, then even when they reach the state of past mental consciousness they should not be established as such, because their nature does not change in the three times.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c05_2']	此釋不然，今且應說。	此釋不然，今且應說。	This explanation is not correct. We will now explain.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c06_11']	何緣一生一住一滅及一果等心心所中，說心名內、心所為外？	何緣一生一住一滅及一果等心心所中，說心名內、心所為外？	Why is it that among the mind and mental activities of one birth, one abiding, one cessation, and one fruit, etc., mind is said to be internal and mental activities are said to be external?
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c07_17']	豈不心所依假我心，是能依性對彼所依極親近故，轉應名內。	豈不心所依假我心，是能依性對彼所依極親近故，轉應名內。	Are not mental activities the support of the false self and mind? They are the supported, and as such, they are extremely close to the support, and therefore they should be called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c09_15']	又非眼等與眼識等常為所依，未曾有心不與心所為所依性，故唯心所應名為內。	又非眼等與眼識等常為所依，未曾有心不與心所為所依性，故唯心所應名為內。	Also, the eye, etc., are not always the support of visual consciousness, etc., but there is no mind that is not the support of mental activities. Therefore only mental activities should be called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c11_4']	或復此中有何殊理，與假我心為所依者立之為內，不立能依？	或復此中有何殊理，與假我心為所依者立之為內，不立能依？	Or, again, what is the special reason for calling that which is the support of the false self and mind internal, and not calling that which is supported internal?
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c11_13']	故彼所言無深理趣。	故彼所言無深理趣。	Therefore the above explanation has no profound meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c13_2']	又心少分是我執依，一切心依皆名為內，由此不應作如是釋：	又心少分是我執依，一切心依皆名為內，由此不應作如是釋：	Also, a small part of mind is the support of self-attachment, and all minds that are supports are called internal. For this reason, you should not explain the above passage as follows:
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c13_14']	我執依止故，假說心為我。	我執依止故，假說心為我。	Because it is the support of self-attachment, mind is metaphorically called self.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c14_12']	又少分心，貪等依故，應一切心皆成染污。	又少分心，貪等依故，應一切心皆成染污。	Also, because a small part of mind is the support of craving, etc., all minds should be defiled.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c15_11']	或少分心，尋伺依故，一切應成有尋有伺。	或少分心，尋伺依故，一切應成有尋有伺。	Or, if it is only a part of mind, then all would have vitarka and vicara, because they are the support of vitarka and vicara.

['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c16_10']	差別因緣不可得故。	差別因緣不可得故。	Because we cannot find a reason for the distinction.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c17_4']	又彼何能遮心所等我執依性？	又彼何能遮心所等我執依性？	Moreover, how can they deny that the support of self-attachment is a mental activity?
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c17_17']	以有身見緣五取蘊為境界故。	以有身見緣五取蘊為境界故。	Because the view of a real self has as its object the five aggregates that are grasped.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c18_8']	是故彼釋，理定不然。	是故彼釋，理定不然。	Therefore their explanation is definitely unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c18_18']	若爾，何緣說心為我？	若爾，何緣說心為我？	If this is so, then why is mind said to be self?
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c19_6']	恒於自境自在行故。	恒於自境自在行故。	Because it is always master of itself and its objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c20_16']	我謂於自境常自在行，心曾無有時不行自境，故一切心皆名為我。	我謂於自境常自在行，心曾無有時不行自境，故一切心皆名為我。	Self means being always master of itself and its objects. Mind is never at any time not master of its own objects, and therefore all mind is called self.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c22_7']	非諸心所亦得我名，意為上首故、經說獨行故、彼要依心能行境故。	非諸心所亦得我名，意為上首故、經說獨行故、彼要依心能行境故。	Mental activities do not also obtain the name of self, because the thinking consciousness is the chief, because a scripture says that it travels alone, and because it can travel to its objects only by depending on mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c23_6']	如諸心所雖亦調伏，而但就勝說調伏心；	如諸心所雖亦調伏，而但就勝說調伏心；	Even though mental activities are also disciplined, still, because it is the most excellent, it is said that mind is disciplined.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c23_16']	說我亦然，唯心非所。	說我亦然，唯心非所。	The same is true of the term self; it refers only to mind, not to mental activities.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c24_14']	若法與此似我之心為不共益，彼名為內；	若法與此似我之心為不共益，彼名為內；	If a dharma is a special benefit to the mind that resembles the self, it is called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c25_13']	與此相違，餘法名外，故諸心所無成內失。	與此相違，餘法名外，故諸心所無成內失。	Dharmas that are contrary to this are called external. Therefore there is no error in the theory that the mental activities are internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c26_16']	又諸心所雖復與心一生住等，而心望心獨名為內。	又諸心所雖復與心一生住等，而心望心獨名為內。	Also, even though the mental activities are born, endure, etc., together with the mind, the mind alone is called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c28_1']	非心所者，同異類心展轉相望為所依性，皆不捨故。	非心所者，同異類心展轉相望為所依性，皆不捨故。	The reason is that the mind and its activities are of the same species, and the mind is the support of the other mental activities, which are not mutually supportive.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0360c28_19', 'ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a01_12']	諸心所法異類望心必定捨離，能依性故。🔽謂若善心望善染污及無記心為所依性，皆不捨離，染污無記心亦如是。	諸心所法異類望心必定捨離，能依性故。 謂若善心望善染污及無記心為所依性，皆不捨離，染污無記心亦如是。	The mental activities are of different species from the mind, and they definitely abandon the nature of support.🔽That is, if a good mind is the support of a good, soiled, or nondefiled mind, it does not abandon them. The same is true of a soiled or nondefiled mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a03_1']	若善心所望彼染污及無記心捨能依性，染污無記望餘亦爾。	若善心所望彼染污及無記心捨能依性，染污無記望餘亦爾。	If a good mental activity is the support of a soiled or nondefiled mind, it abandons the nature of support. The same is true of a soiled or nondefiled mental activity in relation to the others.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a04_1']	故心望心為所依性，無相簡隔，得名為內；	故心望心為所依性，無相簡隔，得名為內；	Therefore the mind, in relation to the mind, is the support and is not distinguished as being different, and so it is called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a05_1']	心所望心為能依性，有相簡隔，不得內名。	心所望心為能依性，有相簡隔，不得內名。	The mental activities are the supported in relation to the mind, but they are not called internal because they are distinguished by their characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a06_1']	又諸心所，望同類心為能依性，或多或少。	又諸心所，望同類心為能依性，或多或少。	Also, the mental activities are the supported in relation to the mind of the same species, but the mind is not so in relation to them.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a06_19']	心為所依則不如是，由此內名在心非所。	心為所依則不如是，由此內名在心非所。	Therefore the name internal belongs to the mind and not to the mental activities.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a07_9']	若爾，大法應受內名。	若爾，大法應受內名。	In that case, the great elements should be called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a08_7']	不爾，心所朋類壞故，如異生中不墮法者。	不爾，心所朋類壞故，如異生中不墮法者。	No, because the class of mental activities is destroyed, just as the nonfallen dharmas of ordinary people.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a09_15']	復有餘師依訓詞理以釋內名，謂我於彼有增上用故名為內。	復有餘師依訓詞理以釋內名，謂我於彼有增上用故名為內。	There is another interpretation that the name internal is explained in terms of the meaning of the word, that is, because we have a dominant power over them, they are called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a10_10']	我謂自體，於所餘法有增上用。	我謂自體，於所餘法有增上用。	We means self-body. We have a dominant power over the remaining dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a11_4', 'ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a12_0']	如彼大德鳩摩邏多說如是頌：🔽「若爪指舌端，　　無別增上用，	如彼大德鳩摩邏多說如是頌： 「若爪指舌端，　　無別增上用，	The great virtuous Kumāralāta says in verse:🔽If the fingernail, tip of the tongue, and so on, had no dominant power,

['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a15_7']	」色香味觸諸色聚中，或唯身根有增上用，如是廣說乃至眼根。	」色香味觸諸色聚中，或唯身根有增上用，如是廣說乃至眼根。	In a collection of forms such as color, smell, taste, and touch, the body faculty alone has a dominant function, and so on up to the eye faculty.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a16_6']	心亦於餘有增上用，是故十二皆得內名。	心亦於餘有增上用，是故十二皆得內名。	The mind also has a dominant function with regard to the other faculties. Therefore the twelve are all called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a17_14']	若爾，受等自體差別，亦見於餘有增上用，是則諸法皆應名內。	若爾，受等自體差別，亦見於餘有增上用，是則諸法皆應名內。	If this is so, then the distinctions in the nature of feeling, etc., are also seen to have a dominant function with regard to other faculties, and in that case all dharmas should be called internal.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a18_17']	上座所宗既一切法皆法處攝，彼宗云何建立內外？	上座所宗既一切法皆法處攝，彼宗云何建立內外？	Since the Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr hold that all dharmas are included in the dharma realm, how do they establish the internal and external?
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a19_8']	彼說如餘，云何如餘？	彼說如餘，云何如餘？	They say that it is like the other , i.e., the five sense bases. How is it like the other five?
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a20_15']	謂為六識作所依者建立為內，不為六識作所依者建立為外。	謂為六識作所依者建立為內，不為六識作所依者建立為外。	That which serves as a support for the six consciousnesses is established as internal, and that which does not serve as a support for the six consciousnesses is established as external.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a21_15']	夫所依者，唯有情數親近不共，色等不定。	夫所依者，唯有情數親近不共，色等不定。	That which is a support is only animate, is close, and is unique, but form, etc., are not necessarily so.

['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a25_10']	如是眼等雖法處攝，與受等同是所依故，而立為內不立為外，所餘法處唯名為外。	如是眼等雖法處攝，與受等同是所依故，而立為內不立為外，所餘法處唯名為外。	Although the eye, etc., are included in the sense base of dharmas, they are established as internal because they are the same as feeling, etc., and are the support, but they are not established as external. The remaining sense bases of dharmas are only called external.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a26_17']	又雖眼等皆通二分，而內外性互不相違，是故不應執此為難。	又雖眼等皆通二分，而內外性互不相違，是故不應執此為難。	Moreover, although the eye, etc., are both internal and external, the natures of internal and external are not mutually contradictory. Therefore, you should not insist on this as a difficulty.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361a28_6']	謂作眼等識所依時立為內性，若作意識所緣境時立為外性。	謂作眼等識所依時立為內性，若作意識所緣境時立為外性。	That is to say, when they are the support for the consciousnesses of the eye, etc., they are established as internal natures. When they are the objects of consciousness as the mental faculty, they are established as external natures.

['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361b05_3']	且於此經，非一切法皆法處攝，由此經中遮十一處攝法處故。	且於此經，非一切法皆法處攝，由此經中遮十一處攝法處故。	Moreover, in this scripture, not all dharmas are included in the dharma realm, because in this scripture it is said that the dharma realm is not included in the eleven sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361b06_10']	亦非唯彼所執別法名為法處，由此經中非如意處說無色故。	亦非唯彼所執別法名為法處，由此經中非如意處說無色故。	Also, it is not only the separate dharmas conceived by them that are called the dharma realm, because in this scripture it is not said that the formless dharmas are like the sense base of mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_006:0361b07_10']	彼宗唯執受想思蘊名別法處，於中無色。	彼宗唯執受想思蘊名別法處，於中無色。	That school only conceives the aggregates of feeling, perception, and impulse, which are called separate dharmas in the dharma realm, to be formless.
