['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a17_18']	從世第一善根無間，即緣欲界苦聖諦境有無漏攝法智忍生，此忍名為苦法智忍。	從世第一善根無間，即緣欲界苦聖諦境有無漏攝法智忍生，此忍名為苦法智忍。	Immediately after the supreme worldly dharmas, there arises a receptivity that is included in the class of pure dharmas and that has as its object the noble truth of suffering in the realm of desire. This receptivity is called receptivity to the knowledge of the dharma of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a18_8']	寧知此忍是無漏攝？	寧知此忍是無漏攝？	How do we know that this receptivity is included in the class of pure dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a20_11']	從世第一無間而生，以契經中言世第一無間入正性決定，或正性離生，爾時名越異生地故。	從世第一無間而生，以契經中言世第一無間入正性決定，或正性離生，爾時名越異生地故。	Because a scripture says, Immediately after the supreme worldly dharmas, one enters into certainty, or the noble path, or the birth of the noble path. At that time, one is said to transcend the stage of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a21_10']	此忍既是決定離生一分所攝，定是無漏。	此忍既是決定離生一分所攝，定是無漏。	Since this receptivity is included in the class of certainty and the noble path, it must be pure.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a22_17']	從世第一無間而生，說無漏言，為欲簡別世第一法所從世忍。	從世第一無間而生，說無漏言，為欲簡別世第一法所從世忍。	It arises immediately after the supreme worldly dharmas. The word pure is used to distinguish it from the supreme worldly dharmas and the receptivity that follows them.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a23_17']	此無漏忍，以欲苦法為其所緣，名苦法忍。	此無漏忍，以欲苦法為其所緣，名苦法忍。	This pure receptivity has as its object the dharmas of suffering in the realm of desire and is called receptivity to the knowledge of the dharma of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a25_15']	謂於苦法無始時來身見所迷執我我所，今創見彼唯苦法性，忍可現前，名苦法忍。	謂於苦法無始時來身見所迷執我我所，今創見彼唯苦法性，忍可現前，名苦法忍。	That is, from beginningless time, the view of a self has been deluded and has grasped me and mine. Now for the first time one sees that they are only the nature of the dharmas of suffering. One is able to accept and manifest this, and it is called receptivity to the knowledge of the dharma of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a27_3']	此能引後苦法智生，是彼智生障之對治，故復名曰苦法智忍。	此能引後苦法智生，是彼智生障之對治，故復名曰苦法智忍。	This is able to induce the subsequent knowledge of dharmas regarding suffering, and is the antidote to the obstacles to the arising of that knowledge, and is therefore also called the receptivity to the knowledge of dharmas regarding suffering.

['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683a29_13']	此能生法智是法智因，得法智忍名，如花果樹。	此能生法智是法智因，得法智忍名，如花果樹。	This is able to give rise to the knowledge of dharmas, and is the cause of the knowledge of dharmas, and is given the name of the knowledge of dharmas, like a tree of flowers and fruits.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b01_16']	詳彼意謂唯說忍言，恐此有同加行忍失，此無深理。	詳彼意謂唯說忍言，恐此有同加行忍失，此無深理。	The intention of that [commentary] is to be examined. It says receptivity alone, fearing that this might be mistaken for the receptivity of preparation. This is not of profound meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b03_1']	非為彼法有此法生，此法必應與彼同類，如花果樹；	非為彼法有此法生，此法必應與彼同類，如花果樹；	It is not that when a dharma arises, this dharma must necessarily be of the same type as that dharma, like a tree of flowers and fruits;

How can the receptivity that gives rise to it be the same as it in being pure?
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b06_17']	又此無同加行忍失，說世第一無間生故，說此能越異生地故，非有漏忍能成此事。	又此無同加行忍失，說世第一無間生故，說此能越異生地故，非有漏忍能成此事。	Also, this patience is not lost through the same preparatory effort, because it is said that the supreme worldly dharmas immediately produce it, and because it is said that it is able to transcend the stage of ordinary beings. A contaminated patience cannot accomplish this.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b07_15']	又如何知此苦法忍以苦法智為等流果？	又如何知此苦法忍以苦法智為等流果？	Also, how do you know that the knowledge of suffering is the outflowing result of the patience that knows suffering?
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b09_5']	若謂此忍是無漏故及前生故，理亦不然，未說此忍無漏理故。	若謂此忍是無漏故及前生故，理亦不然，未說此忍無漏理故。	If you say that this patience is uncontaminated and was previously produced, this is not reasonable, because the principle that this patience is uncontaminated has not yet been established.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b09_14']	由此證知前釋為善。	由此證知前釋為善。	Therefore, this proves that the previous explanation is correct.

Because this is the initial entry into correct determination and the initial entry into correct separation from birth, the scripture speaks of correct nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b14_5']	所謂涅槃或正性言，目諸聖道能決趣涅槃，或決了諦相，故諸聖道得決定名，至得決定說名為入。	所謂涅槃或正性言，目諸聖道能決趣涅槃，或決了諦相，故諸聖道得決定名，至得決定說名為入。	This refers to nirvāṇa, or the correct nature refers to the path of the noble ones that is able to determine and enter nirvāṇa, or is able to determine and understand the characteristics of the truths. Therefore, the path of the noble ones obtains the name of correct determination. The attainment of correct determination is called entry.

['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683b20_7']	又見道中障治定別，以定唯斷見所斷故，餘道不然，謂修位中或有雙斷見修斷惑或唯斷修。	又見道中障治定別，以定唯斷見所斷故，餘道不然，謂修位中或有雙斷見修斷惑或唯斷修。	Also, in the path of insight, the obstacles and their antidotes are definitely separate, because it definitely only eliminates that which is eliminated by insight. It is not so in other paths. This means that in the path of cultivation, sometimes both that which is eliminated by insight and that which is eliminated by cultivation are eliminated, and sometimes only that which is eliminated by cultivation is eliminated.

When this receptivity arises, one abandons the nature of an ordinary person. At the stage of the cessation of this receptivity, one eliminates the ten propensities.

When the lamp reaches the state of extinction, the wick is burned out and the oil is exhausted. If you say that the two abilities belong to the light and heat of the lamp, you should not cite this as an analogy, because one dharma cannot have two abilities.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c07_16']	此難不然，如一法上生位滅位二有性殊，兩位功能亦應異故，理不應許生時有性如滅，亦不應許滅時有性如生。	此難不然，如一法上生位滅位二有性殊，兩位功能亦應異故，理不應許生時有性如滅，亦不應許滅時有性如生。	This objection is not correct. Just as the two states of birth and extinction of a single dharma have different natures, the two abilities of the two states should also be different. It is not reasonable to assert that the nature of birth is like extinction, nor is it reasonable to assert that the nature of extinction is like birth.

['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c13_2']	謂有生時起功能者，有於滅位方有功能。	謂有生時起功能者，有於滅位方有功能。	That is to say, when it is born, it gives rise to one ability, and when it reaches the state of extinction, it has another ability.

['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c20_16']	苦法智忍如解脫道，與異生性不成得俱生故。	苦法智忍如解脫道，與異生性不成得俱生故。	The receptivity to the cognition of the factors of the path, like the path of liberation, arises together with the non-possession of the nature of an ordinary person.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c22_7']	此忍無間即緣欲苦，有法智生，名苦法智，於唯是苦法得決斷慧故。	此忍無間即緣欲苦，有法智生，名苦法智，於唯是苦法得決斷慧故。	Immediately after this receptivity, there arises the cognition of the factors of the path that has the same object as the receptivity, called the cognition of the factors of the path of suffering. This is because one attains the wisdom that definitively understands the factors that are only suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c23_6']	應知此智亦無漏攝，前無漏言遍流後故。	應知此智亦無漏攝，前無漏言遍流後故。	It should be understood that this knowledge is also categorized as pure, because the word pure extends to the following.

It is called patience of conformity with knowledge of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c26_14']	此忍無間即緣此境，有類智生名苦類智。	此忍無間即緣此境，有類智生名苦類智。	Immediately after this patience, there arises knowledge of conformity with regard to the same object, called knowledge of conformity with suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c28_12']	最初證知諸法真理故名法智，此後境智與前相似故得類名，是後隨前而證境義。	最初證知諸法真理故名法智，此後境智與前相似故得類名，是後隨前而證境義。	It is called knowledge of the factors because it is the first knowledge that realizes the truth of dharmas. The knowledge of the subsequent realms is similar to the previous knowledge of the factors and is therefore called knowledge of conformity. It is the knowledge of the subsequent realms that conforms to the previous knowledge of the factors.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0683c29_13']	或從前生故，後得前類名，如世間言子是父類。	或從前生故，後得前類名，如世間言子是父類。	Or it is called knowledge of conformity with the previous knowledge of the factors because it is born from the previous knowledge of the factors, just as the world says that the son conforms to the father.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0684a01_14']	即是從欲界苦決定覺，所生餘界苦決定覺義。	即是從欲界苦決定覺，所生餘界苦決定覺義。	This means that the knowledge of the suffering of the upper realms is born from the knowledge of the suffering of the realm of desire.
['ZH_T29_1562_062:0684a03_12']	如緣苦諦欲界及餘，生法類忍、法類智四，緣餘三諦各四亦然，即緣一一有四心義。	如緣苦諦欲界及餘，生法類忍、法類智四，緣餘三諦各四亦然，即緣一一有四心義。	For example, in regard to the truth of suffering, four are produced in the realm of desire and in the other realms, namely, the receptivity to the knowledge of the law, the knowledge of the law, the receptivity to inferential knowledge, and inferential knowledge. The same is so for the other three truths, each of which produces four. That is, in regard to each of the truths, there is the meaning of four thoughts.
