['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377b01_7']	世尊何故別說根名？	世尊何故別說根名？	Why did the World-Honored One separately speak of the name of faculties?
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377b02_15']	在內界全及法一分，依增上義別說為根，彼彼事中得增上故。	在內界全及法一分，依增上義別說為根，彼彼事中得增上故。	The entire internal realms and one part of the dharma realms are separately spoken of as faculties based on the meaning of predominance, because they attain predominance in each matter.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377b08_21']	諸法相望各各別有增上用故，應並名根，此極增上，別說義成，如師子王及村邑長、轉輪王等，於獸、村邑、四大洲等極增上故。	諸法相望各各別有增上用故，應並名根，此極增上，別說義成，如師子王及村邑長、轉輪王等，於獸、村邑、四大洲等極增上故。	Because each of the dharmas has a superior function with regard to the others, all should be called roots. However, only the most superior are given the name. This is like the lion king, the head of a village, or a universal monarch, who are the most superior among animals, villages, and the four continents, respectively.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377b15_7']	莊嚴身者，謂五根中隨闕一根身醜陋故。	莊嚴身者，謂五根中隨闕一根身醜陋故。	As for adorning the body, it means that if any one of the five faculties is missing, the body is ugly.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377b16_11']	導養身者，謂因見聞避險難故，及於段食能受用故。	導養身者，謂因見聞避險難故，及於段食能受用故。	As for nourishing the body, it means that based on seeing and hearing, one avoids danger and difficulty, and is able to enjoy material food.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377b26_2']	不共事者，謂取自境，見聞嗅甞覺別境故。	不共事者，謂取自境，見聞嗅甞覺別境故。	The unique function refers to apprehending its own object, because it sees, hears, smells, tastes, and cognizes its own object.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377c01_2']	女男命意各於二事有增上用。	女男命意各於二事有增上用。	The female, male, life, and mind faculties each have a dominant influence on two things.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377c02_1']	且女男根二增上者，一有情異、二分別異。	且女男根二增上者，一有情異、二分別異。	As for the two dominant influences of the female and male faculties, the first is the difference in sentient beings, and the second is the difference in discrimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377c03_9']	有情異者，劫初有情形類皆等，二根生已便有女男形類差別。	有情異者，劫初有情形類皆等，二根生已便有女男形類差別。	As for the difference in sentient beings, in the beginning of the eon, the forms and types of sentient beings were all the same.

Because when this exists, they exist; when this does not exist, they do not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377c13_1']	或於眾同分能續及能持，於無色界要有命根，方有所生處決定故。	或於眾同分能續及能持，於無色界要有命根，方有所生處決定故。	Or, in the formless realm, there must be the life faculty in order for the place of rebirth to be determined.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377c22_2']	心雜染故有情雜染，心清淨故有情清淨。	心雜染故有情雜染，心清淨故有情清淨。	Because the mind is defiled, sentient beings are defiled; because the mind is purified, sentient beings are purified.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0377c23_19']	樂等五受、信等八根，於染淨中有增上力，謂樂等五於染增上，貪等隨眠所依事故。	樂等五受、信等八根，於染淨中有增上力，謂樂等五於染增上，貪等隨眠所依事故。	The five faculties such as pleasure have the power of predominance in both defilement and purity. The five such as pleasure have the power of predominance in defilement, because they are the basis for the latent tendencies of craving, etc.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a02_15']	能導養身，非眼等用，是識增上，要由諸識了違順境，方能避險難及受段食故。	能導養身，非眼等用，是識增上，要由諸識了違順境，方能避險難及受段食故。	The function of consciousness, not that of the eye, etc., is predominant in guiding and nourishing the body, because one is able to avoid danger and accept material food only by means of the consciousnesses that perceive favorable and unfavorable objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a05_3']	即彼復謂能見色等不共功能亦非異識，故不共事於眼等根，不可立為別增上用，故非由此眼等成根。	即彼復謂能見色等不共功能亦非異識，故不共事於眼等根，不可立為別增上用，故非由此眼等成根。	They also say that the unique function of seeing form, etc., is not different from consciousness, so the unique function cannot be established as a separate predominant activity for the faculties such as the eye. Therefore, the eye, etc., do not become faculties by means of this.

The five faculties such as the eye have a predominant function in the consciousness that distinguishes each specific object, while the sixth mental faculty has a predominant function in the consciousness that distinguishes all objects. Therefore, the eye and the other six are each established as a faculty.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a16_15']	然無境界亦成根失，以眼等根與能了別一切境識為通因故、識但隨根有明昧故。	然無境界亦成根失，以眼等根與能了別一切境識為通因故、識但隨根有明昧故。	However, there is no error in establishing as a faculty even that which does not have an object, because the eye and other faculties are the common cause for the consciousness that distinguishes all objects, and because the consciousness only has clarity or obscurity according to the faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a17_10']	此說非理，彼同分根應非根故。	此說非理，彼同分根應非根故。	This explanation is unreasonable, because the homogeneous faculties should not be faculties.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a20_10']	又非一切與能了別一切色識為通因性，以諸眼根剎那滅故、了諸色識不俱生故。	又非一切與能了別一切色識為通因性，以諸眼根剎那滅故、了諸色識不俱生故。	Also, the eye is not the common cause of all consciousnesses that perceive form, because the eye is momentary and the consciousnesses that perceive form are not simultaneous.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a21_9']	若言眼類無差別者，色亦應同，類無異故。	若言眼類無差別者，色亦應同，類無異故。	If you say that the eye is not differentiated, then form also should not be differentiated, because the class of form is not differentiated.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a22_16']	若謂青黃種類別者，眼亦應爾，有異熟生及所長養類不同故。	若謂青黃種類別者，眼亦應爾，有異熟生及所長養類不同故。	If you say that blue and yellow are differentiated, then the eye also should be differentiated, because the eye is differentiated as being retribution or being nourished.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a25_4']	識但隨根有明昧者，此亦非因，識體生已方可得有隨根明昧，未生令生增上力等隨闕一種則不生故。	識但隨根有明昧者，此亦非因，識體生已方可得有隨根明昧，未生令生增上力等隨闕一種則不生故。	This is not a reason, because the substance of consciousness must be born before it can be clear or unclear according to the organ. If it is not born, it is not born, even if it is assisted by the dominant force of the organ.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a25_13']	或識隨根有明昧故。	或識隨根有明昧故。	Or, consciousness is clear or unclear according to the organ.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378a28_10']	眼用若微，隨發劣識不了險難令身顛墜，故導養身在根非識。	眼用若微，隨發劣識不了險難令身顛墜，故導養身在根非識。	When the function of the eye is weak, it produces a weak consciousness that does not understand danger and causes the body to fall into it.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378b09_6']	女男根體不離身根，身一分中立此名故。	女男根體不離身根，身一分中立此名故。	The substance of the male and female faculties is not separate from the body faculty, because it is given this name on the basis of a part of the body.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378b11_8']	此處少異餘處身根，謂是欲界身根一分唯能為依，發貪俱起不善身識，故從身根別立為二。	此處少異餘處身根，謂是欲界身根一分唯能為依，發貪俱起不善身識，故從身根別立為二。	This place is slightly different from other places in terms of the body faculty. It is said that in the desire realm, a part of the body faculty can only serve as the support for giving rise to the unwholesome body consciousness that arises together with craving. Therefore, two faculties are established separately from the body faculty.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378b12_16']	劫初等位雖有身根，而無女男身形等異，故應從彼別立二根。	劫初等位雖有身根，而無女男身形等異，故應從彼別立二根。	Even though there is the body faculty in the period at the beginning of the eon, etc., there is no difference in physical form, etc., between male and female. Therefore, two faculties should be established separately from that.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378b14_6']	此亦未越前門中義，前說二根於有情異及分別異，有增上故。	此亦未越前門中義，前說二根於有情異及分別異，有增上故。	This also does not go beyond the meaning within the previous section. The previous explanation is that the two faculties have dominance over the differences among sentient beings and the differences in discrimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378b16_12']	又說命根五受信等，於同分住及染淨中，如其次第有增上用立為根者，此與前門亦無別故，不應重述。	又說命根五受信等，於同分住及染淨中，如其次第有增上用立為根者，此與前門亦無別故，不應重述。	It is also said that the life faculty, the five beginning with faith, etc., have a dominant function in the continuance of similar species and in defilement and purification, respectively, and are established as faculties. This is also no different from the previous section, and therefore should not be repeated.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378b21_6']	亦不異前，無勞重說，即是於淨有增上故。	亦不異前，無勞重說，即是於淨有增上故。	It is also not different from the previous, so there is no need to repeat it. It is precisely because it has the dominant function with regard to purity.

The three stages of seeing, cultivation, and no-more-learning are each different. They do not mutually include each other. One cannot give rise to doubt.

Just as the male and female faculties are established separately from the body faculty, apart from the body faculty there are no separate two faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c03_3']	三根亦爾，雖從九根別義建立，而非離九別有三根，此釋應理。	三根亦爾，雖從九根別義建立，而非離九別有三根，此釋應理。	The three faculties are also like this. Although they are established separately from the nine faculties based on their distinct meanings, they are not separate from the nine and have three faculties. This explanation is reasonable.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c07_8']	此亦不然，唯無間道名增上者，見修道中加行解脫勝進道攝，應不名根。	此亦不然，唯無間道名增上者，見修道中加行解脫勝進道攝，應不名根。	This is also unreasonable. Only the uninterrupted path is called dominant. The path of preparation, the path of liberation, and the path of advancement included in the path of insight and the path of cultivation should not be called faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c09_6']	若通四道皆增上者，順決擇分道類智等，於見所斷煩惱滅中有增上故，應初根攝。	若通四道皆增上者，順決擇分道類智等，於見所斷煩惱滅中有增上故，應初根攝。	If it is the case that the four paths are all dominant faculties, then the path of preparation that conforms to penetration, the knowledge of the class of the four truths, etc., have dominance in the cessation of the passions that are to be eliminated by the path of insight, and therefore should be categorized as the first faculty.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c12_2']	已知根性應攝第三，過失眾多非為善釋，今以別義釋彼等言，謂無漏慧於諸諦理，先未現觀今得現觀有增上力，立第一根；	已知根性應攝第三，過失眾多非為善釋，今以別義釋彼等言，謂無漏慧於諸諦理，先未現觀今得現觀有增上力，立第一根；	The faculty of ultimate knowledge should be categorized as the third faculty, but there are many errors in this interpretation and it is not a good explanation. Now, on the basis of a different interpretation, we explain the term et cetera in the holy teachings. That is, pure understanding has the power of dominance in first attaining realization of the truths that have not been realized, and therefore the first faculty is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c13_18']	若無漏慧已得現觀，於餘煩惱漸永斷中加行希望猶未滿足有增上力，立第二根；	若無漏慧已得現觀，於餘煩惱漸永斷中加行希望猶未滿足有增上力，立第二根；	If pure understanding has already attained realization of the truths, in the gradual elimination of the remaining passions, the power of dominance is established in the hope of the path of added effort, and therefore the second faculty is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c15_8']	若無漏慧已離煩惱，於諸無漏現法樂住有增上力，立第三根。	若無漏慧已離煩惱，於諸無漏現法樂住有增上力，立第三根。	If pure understanding is already free from the passions, the power of dominance is established in the enjoyment of the present life of all pure dharmas, and therefore the third faculty is established.

The seven knowledges are the repeated realization of the truths, and therefore are not included in the first faculty.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c19_7']	又隔忍故，非第二攝，此解脫道應不名根。	又隔忍故，非第二攝，此解脫道應不名根。	Also, because they are separated from acquiescence, they are not included in the second faculty. In that case, the path of liberation should not be called a faculty.

In that case, the faculties that are established would be confused.

It is just as in the world, where one who has already realized the truths is said to realize for the first time the pure truths that he had not realized previously.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0378c26_9']	又如苦集體雖一物，而行相別現觀有別，若於諦理未審決者唯見現觀，若已審決方得名為智見現觀，故彼七智亦得名為先未現觀今得現觀。	又如苦集體雖一物，而行相別現觀有別，若於諦理未審決者唯見現觀，若已審決方得名為智見現觀，故彼七智亦得名為先未現觀今得現觀。	Also, it is just as suffering and its cause are one thing, but their aspects are different and their realizations are different. If one has not yet ascertained and penetrated the truths, he only realizes the truths by seeing. If one has already ascertained and penetrated them, he is said to realize the truths by knowledge and seeing. Therefore the seven knowledges are said to realize for the first time the truths that were not realized previously.

It is not the case in the state of the path of insight.

['ZH_T29_1562_009:0379a02_14']	然盡智等，如初剎那，相續亦爾，皆能任持，金剛喻定所害煩惱、諸離繫得令相續故。	然盡智等，如初剎那，相續亦爾，皆能任持，金剛喻定所害煩惱、諸離繫得令相續故。	However, the knowledge of exhaustion, etc., is like the first moment, and it is also like this in continuity, because it is all able to support the bonds of the passions that are destroyed by the diamond-like samādhi, and it causes the acquisition of separation from those bonds to continue.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0379a03_4']	經主不應同此無失。	經主不應同此無失。	The author of the commentary should not be the same as this and not have the fault.

Therefore, following the majority, it is said that with regard to all objects it is called realization, and it is established as the faculty of having understood.
['ZH_T29_1562_009:0379a07_11']	非度大海或妙高山，餘芥子量未能度故，可名於彼未得度者，此亦應然。	非度大海或妙高山，餘芥子量未能度故，可名於彼未得度者，此亦應然。	It is not that one has not yet crossed the great ocean or the wondrous high mountain, because one has not yet crossed the remaining measure of mustard seeds, that one can be called one who has not yet crossed them. This should be the same as that.

Therefore it is only said that sorrow alone has retribution.

It is not like this for the indeterminate and pure faculties, which collectively are the cause of retribution. Therefore the out-of-order explanation has a profound purpose.

The remaining faculties are the mental faculty and the four faculties of feeling other than sorrow. The phrase faith and so on includes the four faculties of effort and so on. These eleven faculties are both.🔽The mental faculty, faculty of pleasure, faculty of joy, and faculty of equanimity, when unwholesome, wholesome, and contaminated, have retribution.
