['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a08_12']	實非名不悟，故寄中以宣之；	實非名不悟，故寄中以宣之；	001	Reality cannot be understood without a name, so it relies on the middle to proclaim it;
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a09_8']	言非釋不盡，故假論以明之。	言非釋不盡，故假論以明之。	001	words cannot be exhausted without explanation, so it relies on the treatise to clarify it.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a10_14']	其實既宣、其言既明，於菩薩之行、道場之照朗然懸解矣。	其實既宣、其言既明，於菩薩之行、道場之照朗然懸解矣。	001	When reality is proclaimed and words are clarified, the bodhisattva's practice and the illumination of the Way-place are suddenly understood.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a11_11']	夫滯惑生於倒見，三界以之而淪溺；	夫滯惑生於倒見，三界以之而淪溺；	001	Delusion arises from inverted views, and the three realms are drowned in it;

['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a16_2']	故知大覺在乎曠照、小智纏乎隘心，照之不曠則不足以夷有無一道俗、知之不盡則未可以涉中途泯二際，道俗之不夷、二際之不泯，菩薩之憂也。	故知大覺在乎曠照、小智纏乎隘心，照之不曠則不足以夷有無一道俗、知之不盡則未可以涉中途泯二際，道俗之不夷、二際之不泯，菩薩之憂也。	001	Therefore, we know that great enlightenment lies in vast illumination, while lesser wisdom is confined to narrow thoughts. If illumination is not vast, it is insufficient to level the one path of existence and nonexistence, and if knowledge is not exhaustive, it is not yet able to traverse the middle way and obliterate the two ends. The non-leveling of the path of existence and nonexistence, and the non-obliteration of the two ends, are the worries of the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a17_8']	是以龍樹大士，析之以中道，使惑趣之徒望玄指而一變；	是以龍樹大士，析之以中道，使惑趣之徒望玄指而一變；	001	Therefore, the great sage Nāgârjuna analyzes it with the middle way, causing those who pursue delusion to change with a single glance at the profound pointer;

['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a20_8']	蕩蕩焉，真可謂坦夷路於沖階、敞玄門於宇內，扇慧風於陳枚、流甘露於枯悴者矣。	蕩蕩焉，真可謂坦夷路於沖階、敞玄門於宇內，扇慧風於陳枚、流甘露於枯悴者矣。	001	Vast and expansive, it can truly be said to level the path in the void, open the gate of mysteries within the universe, fan the wind of wisdom among the myriad things, and pour the sweet dew on the withered and emaciated.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a22_2']	夫百樑之搆興則鄙茅茨之仄陋，覩斯論之宏曠則知偏悟之鄙倍。	夫百樑之搆興則鄙茅茨之仄陋，覩斯論之宏曠則知偏悟之鄙倍。	001	When the construction of a hundred-beam building begins, it disparages the narrow and humble thatched hut. Seeing the vastness of this treatise, one knows that biased enlightenment is a hundred times more contemptible.

There are also quite a few who have written commentaries to expound it.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001a28_1']	今所出者，是天竺梵志名賓伽羅、秦言青目之所釋也。	今所出者，是天竺梵志名賓伽羅、秦言青目之所釋也。	001	What is presented now is the commentary by the Indian Brahmin named Pingala, which means blue-eyed in Chinese.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001b01_11']	其人雖信解深法而辭不雅中，其中乖闕煩重者法師皆裁而裨之，於經通之理盡矣，文或左右未盡善也。	其人雖信解深法而辭不雅中，其中乖闕煩重者法師皆裁而裨之，於經通之理盡矣，文或左右未盡善也。	001	Although that person had faith and understanding of the profound Dharma, his words were not elegant or moderate. The Dharma Master has edited and supplemented the parts that were incomplete, lacking, verbose, or repetitive, and has made them consistent with the sutra. The meaning is complete, but the wording may still be left and right, not yet perfect.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001b04_7']	《百論》治外以閑邪，斯文袪內以流滯，《大智釋論》之淵博，《十二門觀》之精詣，尋斯四者，真若日月入懷，無不朗然鑒徹矣。	《百論》治外以閑邪，斯文袪內以流滯，《大智釋論》之淵博，《十二門觀》之精詣，尋斯四者，真若日月入懷，無不朗然鑒徹矣。	001	The Bai Lun deals with the external world to eliminate evil, while this text removes internal stagnation. The Da Zhi Shi Lun is profound and vast, and the Shi Er Men Guan is precise and penetrating. If one studies these four texts, it is truly like the sun and moon entering one's heart, illuminating everything clearly.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001b06_5']	予翫之味之，不能釋手，遂復忘其鄙拙託悟懷於一序，并目品義題之於首。	予翫之味之，不能釋手，遂復忘其鄙拙託悟懷於一序，并目品義題之於首。	001	I played with it and savored it, unable to let go of it, and thus forgot my own vulgarity and clumsiness, entrusting my enlightened thoughts to a preface, and named the chapters and meanings at the beginning.

['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001b23_11']	有如是等謬故，墮於無因、邪因、斷常等邪見，種種說我我所，不知正法。	有如是等謬故，墮於無因、邪因、斷常等邪見，種種說我我所，不知正法。	001	Because of these kinds of errors, they fall into wrong views such as no cause, wrong cause, annihilation, and permanence, and various explanations of self and what belongs to self, not knowing the true Dharma.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001b27_13']	佛欲斷如是等諸邪見令知佛法故，先於聲聞法中說十二因緣，又為已習行有大心堪受深法者以大乘法說因緣相，所謂一切法不生不滅、不一不異等，畢竟空、無所有。	佛欲斷如是等諸邪見令知佛法故，先於聲聞法中說十二因緣，又為已習行有大心堪受深法者以大乘法說因緣相，所謂一切法不生不滅、不一不異等，畢竟空、無所有。	001	The Buddha, wishing to eliminate these kinds of wrong views and cause them to know the Buddha's teachings, first explained the twelve links of dependent arising in the teachings for śrāvakas. Moreover, for those who have already practiced and have a great mind capable of receiving the profound teachings, he explained the characteristics of dependent arising using the Mahāyāna teachings, namely that all dharmas are neither produced nor extinguished, neither one nor different, and so forth, ultimately empty and nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001b28_2']	如《般若波羅蜜》中說：	如《般若波羅蜜》中說：	001	As it is said in the Prajñāpāramitā:

They sought the definitive characteristics of the twelve links of dependent arising, the five aggregates, the twelve sense fields, the eighteen elements, and so forth. Not knowing the Buddha's intent, they were attached only to the words. Hearing the teaching of ultimate emptiness in the Mahāyāna, they did not know why it was empty, and so gave rise to doubts and views.
['ZH_T30_1564_001:0001c05_6']	『若都畢竟空，云何分別有罪福報應等？	『若都畢竟空，云何分別有罪福報應等？	001	If everything is ultimately empty, how can there be distinctions of sin, merit, and karmic retribution?

Some say cause and effect are one, some say cause and effect are different, some say the effect pre-exists in the cause, some say the effect does not pre-exist in the cause, some say it arises from itself, some say it arises from others, some say it arises from both, some say it arises from existence, and some say it arises from non-existence.

Existing before and now non-existent is precisely annihilation. If there was a nature before, it is precisely permanence. Therefore, speaking of non-permanence and non-annihilation enters the meaning of non-arising and non-cessation.
