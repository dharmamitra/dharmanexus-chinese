['ZH_T30_1580_001:0883c23_15']	今說《瑜伽師地論》者，名義云何？	今說《瑜伽師地論》者，名義云何？	Now, what is the meaning of the name Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra?
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0883c25_6']	謂一切乘境、行、果等所有諸法皆名瑜伽，一切並有方便善巧相應義故。	謂一切乘境、行、果等所有諸法皆名瑜伽，一切並有方便善巧相應義故。	It is said that all dharmas of the realm, practice, and fruition of all vehicles are called yoga, because they all have the meaning of being associated with skillful means.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0883c27_10']	境瑜伽者，謂一切境無顛倒性、不相違性、能隨順性、趣究竟性，與正理教行果相應，故名瑜伽。	境瑜伽者，謂一切境無顛倒性、不相違性、能隨順性、趣究竟性，與正理教行果相應，故名瑜伽。	As for the yoga of the realm, it refers to the non-erroneous nature, non-contradictory nature, nature that can be followed, and nature that leads to the ultimate of all realms, which is in accord with the correct principles, teachings, practices, and fruits, and is therefore called yoga.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0884a01_8']	此境瑜伽雖通一切，然諸經論就相隨機種種異說，或說諸法四種道理名為瑜伽，觀待作用法爾證成，總攝一切正道理故。	此境瑜伽雖通一切，然諸經論就相隨機種種異說，或說諸法四種道理名為瑜伽，觀待作用法爾證成，總攝一切正道理故。	Although this yoga of the realm is common to all, various sūtras and treatises explain it differently according to their characteristics and types, either saying that the four kinds of principles of all dharmas are called yoga, namely dependence, function, naturalness, and proof, because they comprehensively include all correct principles;
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0884a02_14']	或說二十四不相應行中一名瑜伽，因果相稱無乖違故。	或說二十四不相應行中一名瑜伽，因果相稱無乖違故。	or saying that among the twenty-four kinds of non-associated compositional factors, one is called yoga, because cause and effect are in accord and there is no contradiction;
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0884a03_10']	此二並如〈決擇分〉等處處廣說。	此二並如〈決擇分〉等處處廣說。	these two are extensively explained in various places such as the Section on Ascertainment.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0884a05_2']	或說雜染清淨無性名為瑜伽，除違契順最為勝故，如《大梵問》契經等說。	或說雜染清淨無性名為瑜伽，除違契順最為勝故，如《大梵問》契經等說。	Or it is said that the nature of defilement and purity is called yoga, because it is the most supreme in removing what is contrary to the scriptures, as the scriptures such as the Mahābrahmā Questions Sūtra say.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0884a09_10']	諸瑜伽師，觀無少法可令其生及可令滅，亦無少法欲令證得及欲現觀，謂於一切雜染無性瑜伽中行，觀無少法可令其生及可令滅，及於一切清淨無性瑜伽中行，觀無少法欲令證得及欲現觀。	諸瑜伽師，觀無少法可令其生及可令滅，亦無少法欲令證得及欲現觀，謂於一切雜染無性瑜伽中行，觀無少法可令其生及可令滅，及於一切清淨無性瑜伽中行，觀無少法欲令證得及欲現觀。	The yoga practitioners contemplate that there is no dharma that can be made to arise or made to cease, and also there is no dharma that they wish to realize or wish to realize directly, that is, they practice in the yoga of the nature of defilement without any dharma to be made to arise or cease, and they practice in the yoga of the nature of purity without any dharma that they wish to realize or wish to realize directly.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0884a11_10']	或說究竟清淨真如名為瑜伽，理中最極，一切功德共相應故，如《入楞伽》契經中說。	或說究竟清淨真如名為瑜伽，理中最極，一切功德共相應故，如《入楞伽》契經中說。	Or it is said that the ultimate pure suchness is called yoga, because it is the most supreme among principles and is associated with all merits, as the Laṅkâvatāra Sūtra says.

['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c07_4']	言五識身相應地者，謂眼等根，是眼等識不共所依，眼等不為餘識依故。	言五識身相應地者，謂眼等根，是眼等識不共所依，眼等不為餘識依故。	The phrase “the stage associated with the group of five consciousnesses” means that the eye, etc., are the special supports of visual consciousness, etc., because the eye, etc., are not the supports of other consciousnesses.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c07_18']	又是親依，眼等利鈍識明昧故。	又是親依，眼等利鈍識明昧故。	They are also the proximate supports, because consciousness is clear or dim according to the sharpness or dullness of the eye, etc.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c08_13']	又同時依，必俱有故，非如意等。	又同時依，必俱有故，非如意等。	They are also simultaneous supports, because they must exist simultaneously with consciousness, unlike such things as intention.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c10_2']	由是五識用眼等根標別其名，猶如麥芽、如鼓聲等，故名五識。	由是五識用眼等根標別其名，猶如麥芽、如鼓聲等，故名五識。	Therefore the five consciousnesses are named according to their special supports, just as barley sprouts are called barley sprouts and the sound of a drum is called the sound of a drum.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c11_11']	由所依根有形礙故，又必不離所依身故，猶如身受，故名為身。	由所依根有形礙故，又必不離所依身故，猶如身受，故名為身。	They are called bodies because their supports are material and because they are never separated from their supports, just as bodily sensation is.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c13_4']	又復身者，依義、體義，如六識身、六思身等，依五識身建立此地，故名相應。	又復身者，依義、體義，如六識身、六思身等，依五識身建立此地，故名相應。	Also, body means support and substance, just as there are six consciousnesses, six thoughts, etc. This stage is established on the basis of the group of five consciousnesses, and therefore it is called associated.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c14_7']	如律中說，王相應論、賊相應論，謂依王賊而興言論。	如律中說，王相應論、賊相應論，謂依王賊而興言論。	It is like the saying in the Vinaya that there is talk associated with the king and talk associated with thieves, that is, talk that occurs on the basis of the king and thieves.

['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c16_6']	又五識身相應心品，總名相應。	又五識身相應心品，總名相應。	Also, the class of mind associated with the five consciousnesses is generally called associated.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c17_4']	於此地中雖明多法，以心、心所勝故別說。	於此地中雖明多法，以心、心所勝故別說。	Although many dharmas are discussed in this stage, mind and its activities are the most important and are therefore mentioned separately.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c17_14']	又相應者，是攝屬義。	又相應者，是攝屬義。	Also, associated means the meaning of being included and belonging to.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c19_7']	謂此地中說五識身所攝屬法，即是自性所依所緣、助伴作業，故名相應。	謂此地中說五識身所攝屬法，即是自性所依所緣、助伴作業，故名相應。	That is, the dharmas included in this stage and belonging to the five consciousnesses are the same as the nature, support, objects, companions, and activities of the five consciousnesses, and for that reason they are called associated.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c19_12']	地如前說。	地如前說。	The stage is as explained above.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c20_16']	自後諸地識身相應，隨其所應，亦有通者，略故不說。	自後諸地識身相應，隨其所應，亦有通者，略故不說。	The associated consciousnesses of the other stages have the same meaning, but they are omitted because of the desire for brevity.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c21_16']	言意地者，六、七、八識，同依意根。	言意地者，六、七、八識，同依意根。	The mental stage refers to the sixth, seventh, and eighth consciousnesses, all of which depend on the mental organ.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c22_8']	略去識身相應三語，故但言意。	略去識身相應三語，故但言意。	The three terms consciousness, stage, and associated are omitted, and therefore it is simply called mental.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c23_7']	又實義門雖有八識，然隨機門但有六識。	又實義門雖有八識，然隨機門但有六識。	Also, although there are eight consciousnesses in the true interpretation, there are only six in the interpretation that follows the capacities.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c24_6']	六七八識同第六攝，就所依名故但言意。	六七八識同第六攝，就所依名故但言意。	The sixth, seventh, and eighth consciousnesses are included in the sixth consciousness, because they are named according to their support.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c25_6']	所依非色，或離於身猶如心受，故不言身。	所依非色，或離於身猶如心受，故不言身。	The support is not form, and they are sometimes separated from the body, just like mind and feeling, and therefore they are not called body.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c25_16']	相應准前，故略不說。	相應准前，故略不說。	Association is the same as above, and therefore it is not mentioned.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c27_18']	又六、七、八雖皆同有心、意、識義，心法、意處、識蘊攝故，然意義等，故但言意，皆是思量意根攝故。	又六、七、八雖皆同有心、意、識義，心法、意處、識蘊攝故，然意義等，故但言意，皆是思量意根攝故。	Also, although the sixth, seventh, and eighth consciousnesses all have the meaning of mind, thought, and consciousness, because they are categorized as mental activities, the sense base of thought, and the aggregate of consciousness, their meanings are different, and therefore they are called thought. They are all categorized as the sense base of thought, because they all think.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c28_8']	第八持種，心義偏強；	第八持種，心義偏強；	The eighth consciousness holds the seeds, and the meaning of mind is predominant in it.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0885c29_12']	第六普遍了別境界，識義偏強，是故不說心地、識地。	第六普遍了別境界，識義偏強，是故不說心地、識地。	The sixth consciousness is universal and discriminates objects, and the meaning of consciousness is predominant in it. Therefore, it is not called the mind realm or the consciousness realm.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a01_1']	身及相應，略故不說。	身及相應，略故不說。	The sense base of body and association are omitted because they are too obvious.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a01_6']	地義如前。	地義如前。	The meaning of realm is as explained above.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a03_3']	何緣五識合立一地說在最初，餘識立一說在第二？	何緣五識合立一地說在最初，餘識立一說在第二？	Why are the first five consciousnesses combined into one realm and said to be the first, and the other consciousnesses are each one realm and said to be the second?
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a04_11']	五識同無，當說分別所緣等業，所說事少故合立一，說在最初。	五識同無，當說分別所緣等業，所說事少故合立一，說在最初。	The five consciousnesses are the same in not having these, and their objects, etc., will be discussed later. Since the objects they grasp are few, they are established together as one, and it is said first.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a05_6']	意地翻此，故別立一，說在第二。	意地翻此，故別立一，說在第二。	The mental consciousness is the opposite of this, and therefore it is established separately as one, and it is said second.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a06_4']	又以五識同依色根、同緣色境，故合立一。	又以五識同依色根、同緣色境，故合立一。	Also, the five consciousnesses are the same in depending on material organs and in having the same object, and therefore they are established together as one.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a06_19']	餘依無色、所緣不定，故別立一。	餘依無色、所緣不定，故別立一。	The others depend on immaterial organs, and their objects are not the same, and therefore they are established separately as one.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a07_12']	自性依緣麁細次第，故說先後。	自性依緣麁細次第，故說先後。	The order is that of coarseness and subtlety of nature, support, and object, and therefore they are said first and second.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a08_12']	又以五識同現量攝，故合立一，說在最初。	又以五識同現量攝，故合立一，說在最初。	Also, the five consciousnesses are the same in being categorized as direct perception, and therefore they are established together as one, and it is said first.
['ZH_T30_1580_001:0886a09_16']	餘識不定，或現或比、或非量攝，故別立一，說在第二。	餘識不定，或現或比、或非量攝，故別立一，說在第二。	The other consciousnesses are not definite, sometimes being direct perception, sometimes inference, and sometimes not categorized as either, and therefore it is established separately as one, and it is said second.
