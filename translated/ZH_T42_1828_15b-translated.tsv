['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a04_12']	欲界初起者不定感報。	欲界初起者不定感報。	The initial arising in the desire realm is not necessarily a retribution.

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a13_6']	故知以色界等更起定方受報。	故知以色界等更起定方受報。	Therefore, we know that one receives retribution only after giving rise to samādhi in the form realm, etc.

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a15_14']	若受報。	若受報。	If one receives retribution,
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a16_3']	即應一千劫受彼果。	即應一千劫受彼果。	one should receive its fruits for a thousand eons.

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a21_4']	今時不受此果此業便於生未熟羸劣故。	今時不受此果此業便於生未熟羸劣故。	Now, if one does not receive this fruit, these karmic actions would not yet ripen in the next life, and would therefore be weak.

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a25_10']	義曰。	義曰。	The meaning is said to be:
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a26_2']	即於彼受別報故名後報。	即於彼受別報故名後報。	because one receives separate retribution there, it is called later retribution.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a26_5']	若爾。	若爾。	If so,
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a27_5']	即前於欲界生入定時受別報亦名後報業耶。	即前於欲界生入定時受別報亦名後報業耶。	is the karma that receives separate retribution when one enters concentration in the desire realm also called later retribution karma?

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650a29_4']	又此文云先於此起謂入定。	又此文云先於此起謂入定。	Moreover, this text says first giving rise to it here means entering concentration.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b01_4']	後於色者謂長讀下文謂後生色欲受彼報。	後於色者謂長讀下文謂後生色欲受彼報。	Later in the form realm means reading the following text, which means later being born in the form realm and desire realm to receive that retribution.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b01_13']	非後於色界入定也。	非後於色界入定也。	It is not entering concentration in the form realm later.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b02_8']	若已建立於一切處皆得現前者。	若已建立於一切處皆得現前者。	If it has already been established, it can manifest everywhere.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b03_3']	若依隨轉理門未建立賴耶教。	若依隨轉理門未建立賴耶教。	If one follows the principle of transformation and does not establish the teaching of the storehouse consciousness,
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b04_10']	不還之人先在欲界斷三禪惑伏第四定已上諸惑得入滅定。	不還之人先在欲界斷三禪惑伏第四定已上諸惑得入滅定。	a non-returner who has previously severed the three stages of the desire realm and subdued the afflictions above the fourth meditation can enter the concentration of cessation.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b05_5']	後退滅定生於色界重起滅定。	後退滅定生於色界重起滅定。	Later, regressing from the concentration of cessation, they are reborn in the form realm and again give rise to the concentration of cessation.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b05_17']	恐成斷滅要依色身方入定。	恐成斷滅要依色身方入定。	Fearing annihilation, they must rely on a form body to enter concentration.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b06_8']	故無色界中不起滅定。	故無色界中不起滅定。	Therefore, the concentration of cessation does not arise in the formless realm.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b07_1']	若依真實理建立賴耶教。	若依真實理建立賴耶教。	If one follows the principle of reality and establishes the teaching of the storehouse consciousness,

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b08_5']	而依賴耶亦起滅定。	而依賴耶亦起滅定。	they can still give rise to the concentration of cessation based on the storehouse consciousness.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b08_15']	故於三界處皆得現前。	故於三界處皆得現前。	Therefore, it can manifest everywhere in the three realms.

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b09_8']	依般若等不立賴耶教。	依般若等不立賴耶教。	Based on the Prajñāpāramitā and other teachings that do not establish the storehouse consciousness,
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b09_17']	唯依色身得起滅定。	唯依色身得起滅定。	only by relying on a form body can one give rise to the concentration of cessation.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b10_10']	若依解深密等建立賴耶教。	若依解深密等建立賴耶教。	If one follows the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra and other teachings that establish the storehouse consciousness,
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b11_1']	生無色界得起滅定。	生無色界得起滅定。	one born in the formless realm can give rise to the concentration of cessation.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b11_18']	言依已生無想有情天中名滅分位等者。	言依已生無想有情天中名滅分位等者。	As for the statement based on the already arisen non-perceptual sentient beings in the heavens, it is called the position of cessation, etc.,

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b13_9']	皆言謂不恒行心心所滅之所建立。	皆言謂不恒行心心所滅之所建立。	The two mindless samādhis and the non-perceptual heavens in the Abhidharma all say: It is established by the cessation of the non-continuously operating mind and mental factors.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b14_8']	故知但就彼天果報意識種子立無想天。	故知但就彼天果報意識種子立無想天。	Therefore, it is known that it is only based on the seeds of the manas consciousness of those heavens that the non-perceptual heavens are established.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b15_12']	以彼種子前後相續體是果報無記於彼建立無想天。	以彼種子前後相續體是果報無記於彼建立無想天。	Because those seeds continue before and after, and their substance is the retribution of the indeterminate [dharmas]. They are established in those [heavens] as the non-perceptual heavens.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b16_3']	故無想天亦名異熟。	故無想天亦名異熟。	Therefore, the non-perceptual heavens are also called the matured [results].

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b17_15']	若就本識四蘊名上建立。	若就本識四蘊名上建立。	If it is established based on the four aggregates of the fundamental consciousness,

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b20_1']	就彼天中阿賴耶識建立無想故。	就彼天中阿賴耶識建立無想故。	The non-perception is established based on the ālaya-vijñāna in those heavens.

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b21_14']	故云謂能引發無想定思感彼異熟。	故云謂能引發無想定思感彼異熟。	Therefore it is said that the volition that can induce the attainment of non-perception and feeling experiences its retribution.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b22_6']	即說無想定能滅無想。	即說無想定能滅無想。	It is said that the attainment of non-perception can extinguish the attainment of non-perception.

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b27_10']	又上四句云成賴耶不成六識謂無想天等。	又上四句云成賴耶不成六識謂無想天等。	Also, the four sentences above say that the ālaya consciousness is established but the six consciousnesses are not, referring to the gods in the attainment of non-perception and so on.
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b28_4']	云何此文說命終時有心耶。	云何此文說命終時有心耶。	How can this text say that at the time of death there is mind?

['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650b29_15']	三藏又云。	三藏又云。	The Tripiṭaka master also says:
['ZH_T42_1828_15b:0650c01_5']	後想生已從彼沒者。	後想生已從彼沒者。	As for the text that says after the thought is born, one passes away from there,
