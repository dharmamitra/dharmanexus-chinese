['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a02_1']	此五順益下分界故。	此五順益下分界故。	Because these five accord with and benefit the lower part of the realm.
['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a03_1']	謂唯欲界得下分名，此五於彼能為順益。	謂唯欲界得下分名，此五於彼能為順益。	That is, only those of the realm of desire are called the lower portion. These five are able to assist it.

['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a07_10']	前三能障超下有情，後二能令不超下界，故五皆得順下分名。	前三能障超下有情，後二能令不超下界，故五皆得順下分名。	The first three are able to obstruct the transcendence of lower sentient beings, and the last two are able to prevent the transcendence of the lower realm. Therefore, the five are all called the lower portion.

['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a11_2']	謂所斷中類有三種，唯一通二通四部故，說斷三種攝彼三門。	謂所斷中類有三種，唯一通二通四部故，說斷三種攝彼三門。	That is, among those that are severed, there are three kinds. Only one is common to the two, and the four categories are common. Therefore, saying that he severs three kinds subsumes those three gates.
['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a12_15']	又所斷中三隨三轉，謂邊執見隨身見轉，見取隨戒取轉，邪見隨疑轉。	又所斷中三隨三轉，謂邊執見隨身見轉，見取隨戒取轉，邪見隨疑轉。	Furthermore, among the objects to be eliminated, the three [wrong views] correspond to the three [afflictions] that are eliminated by the path of cultivation. That is, extreme view corresponds to the view of self, adherence to rules and rituals corresponds to adherence to mere rules and rituals, and wrong view corresponds to doubt.
['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a13_15']	說斷三種攝彼三根，故說斷三已說斷六。	說斷三種攝彼三根，故說斷三已說斷六。	It is said that eliminating the three [afflictions] includes eliminating the three roots [of non-virtue]. Therefore, it is said that by eliminating the three, the six are eliminated.

['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a18_11']	趣解脫者亦有如斯相似三障，謂由身見怖畏解脫不欲發趣，由戒禁取依執邪道迷失正路，由疑於道深懷猶預。	趣解脫者亦有如斯相似三障，謂由身見怖畏解脫不欲發趣，由戒禁取依執邪道迷失正路，由疑於道深懷猶預。	Those who seek liberation also have similar three obstacles: because of the view of self, they fear liberation and do not want to set out; because of adherence to mere rules and rituals, they rely on wrong paths and lose their way; because of doubt, they deeply doubt the path.
['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a19_11']	佛顯預流永斷如是趣解脫障，故說斷三。	佛顯預流永斷如是趣解脫障，故說斷三。	The Buddha shows that the stream-enterer permanently eliminates these obstacles to seeking liberation, and therefore says that by eliminating the three, the six are eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1558_021:0109a20_12']	佛於餘經，如順下分，說順上分亦有五種。	佛於餘經，如順下分，說順上分亦有五種。	In other sūtras, the Buddha says that there are also five factors that accord with the upper realms, just as there are with the lower realms.

That is, the first six annihilations are established by means of three conditions, because one acquires the pure possession of separation from bonds, because one pierces the summit of existence, and because one destroys the two causes.

Even though one has pierced the summit of existence in the state of the knowledge of the factors with regard to suffering and the patience that is the knowledge of the factors with regard to the origin, one has still not destroyed the two causes, because one has not yet destroyed the two causes that are universally eliminated by the path of insight.

Therefore, the condition of transcending the realm is established separately from the extinction of the two kinds of causes.
