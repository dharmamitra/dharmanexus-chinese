The Fashang catalogue says that Tripiṭaka Master Paramārtha translated the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha-śāstra in 20 fascicles in the second year of Taiqing of the Liang dynasty, but this must be a mistake. It is probably a mistake in the transmission of the 12 fascicles. Now, according to the Fanglu, Paramārtha's translation of the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha-śāstra is in the Chen dynasty. Since the Liang catalogue does not exist, it is not included. The total number of lost Mahāyāna sūtras, vinaya, and śāstras is:
