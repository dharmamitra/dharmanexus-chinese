The various sutras of the Vaipulya class are not as detailed as the Sutra of the Jeweled Necklace in clarifying the stages, and the various sutras of the Prajnaparamita class are not as detailed as the Sutra of the Benevolent King in clarifying the stages. However, the Sutra of the Jeweled Necklace mostly preserves the separate teaching, and the Sutra of the Benevolent King mostly belongs to the perfect and separate teachings and contains the meaning of the common teaching, but they both do not clearly explain the meaning of the stages.

Relying on the mind being unmixed, he attained the name white, and the principle of the heavenly supreme wheel king is naturally so.

The Abhidharma of Establishing the World has an outer path that calculates that the great earth always moves without stopping. The Buddha refutes it, saying that if an object is thrown forward, the object should go backward.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0884a29_12']	又有計云地恒墜下，佛言擲物向上應不至地。	又有計云地恒墜下，佛言擲物向上應不至地。	There are also those who calculate that the earth always falls downward. The Buddha says that if an object is thrown upward, it should not reach the ground.

Now, it says not killing up to the seven precepts. It is because one who fully receives [the precepts] may partially uphold them, and the superior upholding is given the name.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0884b03_20']	「世間戒」者，譏嫌戒也。	「世間戒」者，譏嫌戒也。	Worldly precepts are the precepts against shameful acts.

['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886b05_12']	此中皆約菩薩故也。	此中皆約菩薩故也。	Here, they are all about bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886b07_7']	初如三藏云伏見思即指菩薩，今明無量多在出假故，且置二乘故；	初如三藏云伏見思即指菩薩，今明無量多在出假故，且置二乘故；	First, as the Tripiṭaka says, subduing the delusions of views refers to bodhisattvas. Now, it is explained that the immeasurable is mostly in the stage of skillful means, so the two vehicles are temporarily set aside.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886b08_1']	通教中亦指出假，助謂助別。	通教中亦指出假，助謂助別。	In the Shared Teaching, it is also said that skillful means assist the Distinct.

If based on the beginning and end, although one severs on the grounds, since the realization of the Way is the same as the perfect, one should know that there is the meaning of severing in the teaching path.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886b12_9']	故今從事且判地前屬於別教，則迴向中伏望於圓理，故得事名。	故今從事且判地前屬於別教，則迴向中伏望於圓理，故得事名。	Therefore, now following the matter, it is provisionally judged that the stage before the grounds belongs to the Distinct Teaching, then the subduing in the stage of intent towards the Way looks up to the perfect principle, and thus obtains the name of matter.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886b13_10']	圓人破無明位長，故指初住去以為無量四判。	圓人破無明位長，故指初住去以為無量四判。	The stage of breaking ignorance for the perfect person is long, therefore it points to the initial ground and above as the immeasurable four judgments.

The seventh chapter of the Compendium of the Great Vehicle, in explaining the fourth characteristic of cause and effect, also only clarifies the ten grounds such as the ground of joy. The Treatise on the Stages of Concentration Practice clarifies the six stages such as the spiritual lineage. As quoted in the fifth chapter of the Mohe Zhiguan, the first text of the Shizhu Posha only clarifies the ten grounds.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886b23_2']	次釋地相亦無諸位，《大論》略出通別，文但引例，故知諸論明位麁略。	次釋地相亦無諸位，《大論》略出通別，文但引例，故知諸論明位麁略。	Next, explaining the characteristics of the stages, there are also no various positions. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra briefly presents the general and specific, the text only cites examples, therefore it is known that the various treatises clarify the positions in a rough and brief manner.

The meaning is to accomplish the correct meaning of the practitioner entering the Way. If there are no stages, what can be used as the standard for the wise to contemplate and emulate?
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886b27_10']	將何以越增上慢罪？	將何以越增上慢罪？	What can be used to transcend the sin of overestimating oneself?

['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886c06_8']	今一家別位若不依《纓珞》則位無始終，若不依《大品》則諸位全無斷惑高下用觀分齊，若不依《涅槃》則菩薩願行淺深相狀遠近莫知，三經相成佛旨無失。	今一家別位若不依《纓珞》則位無始終，若不依《大品》則諸位全無斷惑高下用觀分齊，若不依《涅槃》則菩薩願行淺深相狀遠近莫知，三經相成佛旨無失。	Now, if our family's separate stages do not rely on the Sutra of the Jeweled Necklace, then the stages will have no beginning or end. If they do not rely on the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, then the various stages will be completely without the high and low uses of severing delusions and the distinctions of the contemplation. If they do not rely on the Nirvana Sutra, then the characteristics of the bodhisattva's vows and practices, whether shallow or deep, near or far, will be unknown. The three sutras support each other and the Buddha's purport is not lost.

['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886c12_2']	「如來成道二十九年，先已為我說《摩訶般若》」，故知《仁王》在後明矣。	「如來成道二十九年，先已為我說《摩訶般若》」，故知《仁王》在後明矣。	Twenty-nine years after the Tathagata attained enlightenment, he first expounded the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra for me. Therefore, it is known that the Benevolent Kings Sutra is later.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886c13_19']	若《光讚經》準諸經目錄，弘始五年四月二十三日譯《大品》竟，二十七卷成者是也。	若《光讚經》準諸經目錄，弘始五年四月二十三日譯《大品》竟，二十七卷成者是也。	If the Sutra of the Profound Meaning is based on various sutra catalogs, the translation of the Great Section was completed on the twenty-third day of the fourth month in the fifth year of Hongshi, and the twenty-seven-scroll version was completed.
['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886c16_23']	後竺法護晉太康元年譯上帙為《光讚》，又朱仕衡譯為二十卷，名《放光般若》，羅什又重譯為十卷，名「小品」，支讖又譯為十卷，名「道行」。	後竺法護晉太康元年譯上帙為《光讚》，又朱仕衡譯為二十卷，名《放光般若》，羅什又重譯為十卷，名「小品」，支讖又譯為十卷，名「道行」。	Later, Zhu Faxing translated the upper fascicle as the Sutra of the Profound Meaning in the first year of Taikang in the Jin dynasty, and Zhu Shiheng translated it into twenty scrolls, named the Sutra of the Profound Meaning of Prajna, which was again translated by Kumarajiva into ten scrolls, named the Small Section, and Zhi Chen also translated it into ten scrolls, named the Way of Practice.

['ZH_T33_1717_010:0886c22_2']	為是義故，與《仁王》、《天王》而為次第者，未可全用。	為是義故，與《仁王》、《天王》而為次第者，未可全用。	For this reason, using it as a sequence with the Benevolent Kings and Heavenly Kings sutras, it is not entirely usable.

Either the three encompass the six, or the three essentials are briefly mentioned. However, the functions of the various stages, the characteristics of the practices and vows, the types of afflictions eliminated, the breadth of benefiting beings, the purity of the lands relied upon, the frequency of revealing traces, the superiority or inferiority of the true and provisional, the corresponding Dharma gates, and so forth, cannot be listed in detail. Therefore, the present text only clarifies one approach. The reason for not elaborating on the characteristics of the Dharma in detail is that the present text follows the structure and does not go into great detail. If one extensively searches the sūtras and treatises, one may add miscellaneous content to the original text. Therefore, one should know that relying on the characteristics of this text is sufficient to distinguish the provisional and the real.

Entering emptiness from the provisional is the general characteristic in the cause. Entering the provisional from emptiness is the specific characteristic in the cause. When individuals cultivate the middle, they first only have the general characteristic, which is the general in the result. If they enter the first ground and illuminate the two truths simultaneously, it is the specific in the result. One should know that the four meanings are no different from the three.

Under the names there is meaning, which then reveals what is to be interpreted. Above the meaning there are names, which then know that the interpretation is different. Therefore, the chapter on names and meanings comes first.

Having already understood the functions of cutting off and subduing in the perfect approach, if one does not compare it to the previous positions which are all coarse, how can one know that this position is the most supreme among all positions?

Since conditions arise alternately, matters must be abandoned alternately. The teachings before the Lotus Sutra arise and are abandoned alternately. Although the teachings are abandoned in terms of people, the Dharma still remains. Moreover, the great and small are both taught, but the benefits received are not equal.

Whether horizontal or vertical, the flavors of the Dharma are distinct. When the time is ripe and the transformation is complete, all will gather in the Lotus Sutra. Since the faculties and conditions are the same, there should be no different traces. All the coarse will reach this subtle principle, which is equal. Therefore, there must be the appearance of revealing and manifesting.

Since one enters the ten faiths through the ten practices, the meaning of this passage must be complete in both horizontal and vertical aspects.

Compassion and vast vows are upheld by the power of mindfulness. The mind's peace in calming and insight is due to vigor. Breaking through the three hindrances, wondrous wisdom is then all-pervasive. The unobstructedness of the penetrating [wisdom] is due to the power of determination. Originally cultivating the factors of the path is for the sake of nonretrogression. The absence of deficiency in the correct and auxiliary [practices] turns the cause towards the fruition. Not confusing the stages is then able to protect the Dharma. The inner and outer imperturbability is due to skillfully preventing non-dharmas. The absence of attachment to the Dharma is due to the power of great vows.
