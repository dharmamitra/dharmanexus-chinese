For this reason, they imagine and speculate that conditioned forces either temporarily abide or are ultimately permanent.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366a24_7']	是故世尊為顯諸行因果展轉，無始時來雖剎那滅而不壞斷，非一切果從一因生，亦非無因而生諸行，密意為說如是契經，以眼為門唯為見色，廣說乃至以意為門唯為了法。	是故世尊為顯諸行因果展轉，無始時來雖剎那滅而不壞斷，非一切果從一因生，亦非無因而生諸行，密意為說如是契經，以眼為門唯為見色，廣說乃至以意為門唯為了法。	007	Therefore, the World-Honored One, in order to show that conditioned forces, cause and effect, have continued from beginningless time, although momentary and ceasing, are not destroyed, and that not all effects arise from a single cause, and conditioned forces do not arise without a cause, spoke this sutra with a hidden meaning, saying, The eye is the door, only for seeing forms, and so on, up to The mind is the door, only for cognizing dharmas.

['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366a28_18']	又此契經為顯眼等各有二用，一能為門、二能取境。	又此契經為顯眼等各有二用，一能為門、二能取境。	007	Also, this sūtra passage shows that each of the sense bases such as the eye has two functions: one is to serve as a door, and the other is to grasp an object.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b01_6']	能為門者，且如眼根能為所依，令心心所各別行相於境而轉。	能為門者，且如眼根能為所依，令心心所各別行相於境而轉。	007	As for serving as a door, the eye sense base, for example, serves as a support, causing mind and mental activities to evolve with their respective modes of activity in regard to objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b02_1']	能取境者，且如眼根唯為見色。	能取境者，且如眼根唯為見色。	007	As for grasping an object, the eye sense base, for example, only sees form.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b03_1']	若異此者，唯義相違，諸心心所唯應見故。	若異此者，唯義相違，諸心心所唯應見故。	007	If this were not so, there would be a contradiction with the meaning, because mind and mental activities would only see.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b04_1']	然心心所皆眼為門，汝執見體唯心非所。	然心心所皆眼為門，汝執見體唯心非所。	007	However, mind and mental activities all have the eye as a door. You maintain that the substance of seeing is only mind and not mental activities.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b05_9']	又受想等諸心所法，領納取像造作等用各各不同，不應唯見。	又受想等諸心所法，領納取像造作等用各各不同，不應唯見。	007	Also, such mental activities as feeling, conceptualization, and volition have different functions, such as the experiencing of an object, grasping an image, and creating karma. They should not only see.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b06_7']	既言唯見，明知是眼，由此眼根唯能見故。	既言唯見，明知是眼，由此眼根唯能見故。	007	Since it is said that they only see, it is clear that this is the eye, because the eye sense base only sees.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b07_7']	如是眼用略有二種，一能為門、二能見色。	如是眼用略有二種，一能為門、二能見色。	007	Thus the function of the eye is of two kinds: one is to serve as a door, and the other is to see form.

['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b09_13']	又此契經更有別義，謂見方便假說為門，世於方便說門言故。	又此契經更有別義，謂見方便假說為門，世於方便說門言故。	007	Moreover, this sūtra has another meaning, namely, the expedient of seeing is metaphorically called a door, because the world speaks of a door in terms of expedient means.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b09_18']	如世間說：	如世間說：	007	It is just as the world says:
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b10_11']	我依此門必當獲得如意財寶。	我依此門必當獲得如意財寶。	007	I must obtain the wealth and treasures I desire by relying on this door.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b11_2']	即是我依此方便義。	即是我依此方便義。	007	This means that I rely on this expedient.

['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b12_10']	謂四攝事為攝方便。	謂四攝事為攝方便。	007	That is, the four means of gathering [the assembly] are the expedient means of gathering.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b13_9']	此說眼識為見方便，眼由識持，能見色故；	此說眼識為見方便，眼由識持，能見色故；	007	This says that eye consciousness is the expedient of seeing, because the eye, held by consciousness, is able to see forms;
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b14_8']	識是眼根，見方便故、見依止故，假說名眼。	識是眼根，見方便故、見依止故，假說名眼。	007	because consciousness is the expedient of seeing for the eye faculty and is the basis of seeing, it is metaphorically called the eye.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b16_15']	此意說言，識為方便，眼能見色，如餘經中了別色位，以眼是識所依性故、隣近緣故，於眼根體假說識名。	此意說言，識為方便，眼能見色，如餘經中了別色位，以眼是識所依性故、隣近緣故，於眼根體假說識名。	007	This means that consciousness is the expedient, and the eye is able to see forms. It is just as in other sūtras, where the state of distinguishing forms is metaphorically called the eye, because the eye is the nature that is the support of consciousness and is a proximate condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b17_1']	故契經言：	故契經言：	007	Therefore a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b17_6']	眼所識色。	眼所識色。	007	The eye cognizes forms.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b19_3']	此中亦爾，觀照色位以識是眼，隣近緣故、所依止故，於眼識體假說眼名，無違經失。	此中亦爾，觀照色位以識是眼，隣近緣故、所依止故，於眼識體假說眼名，無違經失。	007	The same is true here. In the stage of illuminating form, consciousness is the eye because it is the proximate condition and the support. It is provisionally said to be the eye in the substance of visual consciousness, and there is no error in contradicting the scripture.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b21_6']	為捨外道我任持根，令能取境顛倒執故，如是假說，令彼梵志了識持根能取自境，非我持故。	為捨外道我任持根，令能取境顛倒執故，如是假說，令彼梵志了識持根能取自境，非我持故。	007	In order to abandon the non-Buddhist view that the self supports the faculties and enables them to grasp objects with error, this provisional designation is made. It is to enable those Brahmins to understand that consciousness supports the faculties and is able to grasp its own objects, not that the self supports them.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b23_12']	若爾，應說眼識為門唯為見色，不應說識，勿彼外道執我能見，謂所執我以識名說，世聞多執識為我故。	若爾，應說眼識為門唯為見色，不應說識，勿彼外道執我能見，謂所執我以識名說，世聞多執識為我故。	007	If that is so, it should be said that visual consciousness is the door only for seeing forms, and it should not be said to be consciousness, lest those non-Buddhists grasp the self as the seer, thinking that the self they grasp is referred to by the term consciousness, because the world often grasps consciousness as the self.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b24_11']	若說為眼，即知眼識眼為所依，定非是我。	若說為眼，即知眼識眼為所依，定非是我。	007	If it is said to be the eye, then one would know that visual consciousness is the eye, which is the support. It definitely is not the self.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b25_1']	我體常住，定無所依；	我體常住，定無所依；	007	The substance of the self is eternally abiding and definitely has no support.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b25_11']	聞說有依，我想便息。	聞說有依，我想便息。	007	When one hears that there is a support, the thought of self is then eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b26_4']	又避餘過不應說識，謂經當說：	又避餘過不應說識，謂經當說：	007	Moreover, in order to avoid other errors, consciousness should not be said. The scripture should say:
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b26_13']	以意為門唯為了法。	以意為門唯為了法。	007	The mind is the door only for the understanding of dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b27_7']	若說識者，即定應說意識為門。	若說識者，即定應說意識為門。	007	If you say that consciousness is the door, then you must say that mental consciousness is the door.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366b28_15']	若作是說，便不應理，以即意識能了諸法，非餘意了識為方便。	若作是說，便不應理，以即意識能了諸法，非餘意了識為方便。	007	If you say this, then it is not reasonable, because it is mental consciousness itself that understands dharmas, not that the mind understands by means of consciousness as a means.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c01_3']	豈不說意亦有斯過，謂如說眼為門，即知是眼識為見方便。	豈不說意亦有斯過，謂如說眼為門，即知是眼識為見方便。	007	Isn't it the case that the same error applies to the statement about the mind? That is, just as it is known that eye consciousness is the means by which the eye sees when it is said that the eye is the door,
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c02_1']	如是說意為門，亦知是意識為了方便。	如是說意為門，亦知是意識為了方便。	007	in the same way, it is known that mental consciousness is the means by which the mind understands when it is said that the mind is the door.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c02_11']	雖復說意，而無斯過。	雖復說意，而無斯過。	007	Even though it is said to be the mind, there is no such error.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c03_6']	由聞意名，唯作意解，非謂意識。	由聞意名，唯作意解，非謂意識。	007	This is because when the name mind is heard, one only understands it to be the mind, not mental consciousness.

['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c03_21']	眼根有用，識俱生故。	眼根有用，識俱生故。	007	Because the eye faculty has a function, being born together with consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c04_17']	眼識與眼作見方便，故於此識可說眼名。	眼識與眼作見方便，故於此識可說眼名。	007	Because eye consciousness is the means by which the eye sees, the name eye can be applied to this consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c06_6']	意根無用，以過去故，意識與意不作方便，故於意識不說名意。	意根無用，以過去故，意識與意不作方便，故於意識不說名意。	007	The mind faculty has no function, because it is past. Mental consciousness is not the means by which the mind understands, and therefore mental consciousness is not called the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c07_5']	意為意識了法方便，要依意根能了法故。	意為意識了法方便，要依意根能了法故。	007	The mind is the expedient means by which mental consciousness perceives dharmas, because it must rely on the mind faculty in order to perceive dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c08_8']	由是若說以眼為門，智者應知為捨我執說識為眼。	由是若說以眼為門，智者應知為捨我執說識為眼。	007	Therefore, when it is said that the eye is the door, the wise should understand that the Buddha spoke of consciousness as the eye in order to eliminate the attachment to a self.
['ZH_T29_1562_007:0366c10_2']	若至第六說意為門，智者應知意即是意無了用故，意為方便意識能了。	若至第六說意為門，智者應知意即是意無了用故，意為方便意識能了。	007	When it is said that the sixth consciousness is the door, the wise should understand that the mind is the mind, because it has no function of perception. The mind is the expedient means by which mental consciousness is able to perceive.
