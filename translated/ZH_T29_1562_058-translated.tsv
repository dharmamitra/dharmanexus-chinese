['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a07_18']	定無實樂，受唯是苦。	定無實樂，受唯是苦。	There is definitely no real pleasure, only suffering in feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a08_3']	云何知然？	云何知然？	How do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a08_8']	由理教故。	由理教故。	Because of reasoning and teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a08_13']	由何等理？	由何等理？	What are the reasons?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a08_18']	後苦增故。	後苦增故。	Because suffering increases later.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a10_5']	謂於一切所作事業及威儀中，若久習住，皆於後位苦增可得。	謂於一切所作事業及威儀中，若久習住，皆於後位苦增可得。	That is to say, if one dwells for a long time in all activities and deportment, one can obtain increasing suffering later.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a11_13']	理必無有習住樂因，令於後時苦漸增盛，故知決定無實樂受。	理必無有習住樂因，令於後時苦漸增盛，故知決定無實樂受。	Reasonably, there is definitely no cause of dwelling in pleasure that can make suffering gradually increase later, therefore we know that there is definitely no real pleasant feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a14_10']	又處生死有動作故，謂有動作是生死法，身有沐浴飲食等事，心有於境了別等業，事業驅迫甞不安寧，故生死中無非是苦。	又處生死有動作故，謂有動作是生死法，身有沐浴飲食等事，心有於境了別等業，事業驅迫甞不安寧，故生死中無非是苦。	Moreover, because there is activity in the cycle of birth and death. That is to say, having activity is a characteristic of the cycle of birth and death. The body has activities such as bathing and eating, and the mind has activities such as cognizing objects. Activities oppress and never bring peace, therefore there is no non-suffering in the cycle of birth and death.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a17_15']	又由微苦伏勝樂故，謂少苦因蚊虻𭪿等所生微苦現在前位，力能摧伏廣大樂因，沐浴塗香飲食眠等，所生勝樂令不現前，故有漏蘊唯是苦性。	又由微苦伏勝樂故，謂少苦因蚊虻𭪿等所生微苦現在前位，力能摧伏廣大樂因，沐浴塗香飲食眠等，所生勝樂令不現前，故有漏蘊唯是苦性。	Moreover, because of the subduing of superior pleasure by slight suffering, that is, when slight suffering produced by the causes of mosquitoes, gadflies, and wind is present, it is able to subdue the superior pleasure produced by the causes of bathing, anointing, eating, sleeping, etc., and prevent it from being present. Therefore the contaminated aggregates are only of the nature of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a18_14']	又於對治重苦逼中，愚夫起樂增上慢故。	又於對治重苦逼中，愚夫起樂增上慢故。	Moreover, because fools give rise to the conceit of superior pleasure in the midst of the oppression of heavy suffering that is to be counteracted.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a21_2']	謂若未遇飢渴寒熱疲欲等苦所逼迫時，於能治中不生樂覺，是故樂覺由治苦生，非緣樂生故無實樂。	謂若未遇飢渴寒熱疲欲等苦所逼迫時，於能治中不生樂覺，是故樂覺由治苦生，非緣樂生故無實樂。	That is, if one is not oppressed by the suffering of hunger, thirst, cold, heat, fatigue, and desire, etc., then one does not give rise to the perception of pleasure in that which counteracts it. Therefore the perception of pleasure arises from the counteraction of suffering, not from the arising of pleasure. Therefore there is no real pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a22_1']	又於眾苦易脫位中，世間有情樂覺生故。	又於眾苦易脫位中，世間有情樂覺生故。	Moreover, because the perception of pleasure arises in the state of easy deliverance from various sufferings.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a22_11']	依如是義，故有頌言：	依如是義，故有頌言：	Based on this meaning, there is a verse that says:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a23_0']	「如擔重易肩，　　及疲勞止息，	「如擔重易肩，　　及疲勞止息，	Just as when carrying a heavy load one changes shoulders, or when tired one stops to rest,
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a24_13']	世間由此苦，　　脫彼苦亦然。	世間由此苦，　　脫彼苦亦然。	The world, by this suffering, is delivered from that suffering as well.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a25_17']	」故愚夫類於辛苦中，有樂覺生實無有樂。	」故愚夫類於辛苦中，有樂覺生實無有樂。	Therefore, the class of foolish people have the perception of pleasure in suffering, but there is no real pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a26_3']	由何等教？	由何等教？	By what teaching?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a26_8']	如世尊言：	如世尊言：	As the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a26_17']	諸所有受無非是苦。	諸所有受無非是苦。	All that is felt is not non-suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a27_2']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Also, the sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a27_14']	此生時苦生、此滅時苦滅。	此生時苦生、此滅時苦滅。	When this arises, suffering arises; when this ceases, suffering ceases.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a27_19']	又契經言：	又契經言：	Also, the sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a28_10']	於苦謂為樂，名想顛倒等。	於苦謂為樂，名想顛倒等。	Regarding suffering as pleasure is called the perversion of conceptualization, and so on.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a28_15']	又契經言：	又契經言：	Also, the sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663a29_4']	汝應以苦觀於樂受。	汝應以苦觀於樂受。	You should contemplate pleasure as suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b01_3']	此謂他宗對法諸師咸作是說定有實樂。	此謂他宗對法諸師咸作是說定有實樂。	This is what the Abhidharma masters of other schools all say, that there is definitely real pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b01_8']	云何知然？	云何知然？	How do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b02_7']	苦樂生因功能別故，體實有異，猶如貪瞋。	苦樂生因功能別故，體實有異，猶如貪瞋。	Because the power of the causes of pleasure and suffering is different, their substance is truly different, just like greed and hatred.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b03_14']	現見貪瞋生因各別，別因生已功能復異，因能異故體別極成。	現見貪瞋生因各別，別因生已功能復異，因能異故體別極成。	It is currently seen that the causes of greed and hatred are different, and after arising from different causes, their power is also different. Because the causes are different, their difference is well established.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b05_3']	苦樂生因既亦有別，世間現見大種互違便有苦生，調和生樂。	苦樂生因既亦有別，世間現見大種互違便有苦生，調和生樂。	The causes of pleasure and suffering are also seen to be different in the world. It is seen that suffering arises from the mutual opposition of the great elements, and pleasure arises from their harmony.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b06_2']	別因生已功能亦異，苦能損害，樂能攝益。	別因生已功能亦異，苦能損害，樂能攝益。	The function of the cause of differentiation is also different from that of the cause of birth. Suffering harms, while pleasure benefits.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b07_1']	生因功能見有別故，定知苦外實有樂體。	生因功能見有別故，定知苦外實有樂體。	Because the function of the cause of birth is seen to be different, we definitely know that apart from suffering there really is a substance of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b07_10']	上座於此亦作是言：	上座於此亦作是言：	The Sthavira also says this:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b09_7']	雖現非無攝益受位，而於苦類未為超越，以有漏法唯是苦因，故生死中受唯是苦。	雖現非無攝益受位，而於苦類未為超越，以有漏法唯是苦因，故生死中受唯是苦。	Although there is no lack of a state of feeling that benefits in the present, it has not yet transcended the category of suffering, because contaminated dharmas are only causes of suffering. Therefore, feeling in saṃsāra is only suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b09_12']	此亦非理。	此亦非理。	This is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b09_17']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b10_17', 'ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b11_15']	言相違故、唯立宗故、成非愛故、不極成故。🔽言相違者，謂若非無攝益受位，不應唯苦。	言相違故、唯立宗故、成非愛故、不極成故。 言相違者，謂若非無攝益受位，不應唯苦。	Because it contradicts what you have said, because it only establishes a thesis, because it would result in something undesirable, and because it is not established.🔽As for contradicting what you have said, if there is no lack of a state of feeling that benefits, then it should not be only suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b13_3']	若言唯苦，不應攝益，理但應言下苦受位有劣損害，無容攝益。	若言唯苦，不應攝益，理但應言下苦受位有劣損害，無容攝益。	If you say it is only suffering, then it should not benefit. The principle should only say that in the state of inferior suffering there is slight harm and no benefit is allowed.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b15_1']	唯立宗者，謂彼但說未越苦類，竟不說因，以何證知攝益受位於苦受類未為超越？	唯立宗者，謂彼但說未越苦類，竟不說因，以何證知攝益受位於苦受類未為超越？	The only thing they establish is that pleasure does not transcend the category of suffering, but they do not give a reason. How do you know that the experience of pleasure does not transcend the category of suffering?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b16_17']	成非愛者，謂彼宗中執信與貪不越思類，是則彼二體應成一，染淨二品更相雜故。	成非愛者，謂彼宗中執信與貪不越思類，是則彼二體應成一，染淨二品更相雜故。	The second reason is that in their system, faith and craving do not transcend the category of thought. In that case, these two must be identical, because the pure and the defiled would be mixed.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b18_6']	解脫應無成非愛失，彼既無雜，此亦應然，受類雖同而苦樂異。	解脫應無成非愛失，彼既無雜，此亦應然，受類雖同而苦樂異。	Liberation would be without the fault of being defiled, because they are not mixed. Pleasure and suffering are the same in being experiences, but they are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b19_15']	不極成者，謂生死中樂受定無，非極成故，是則有漏亦是樂因。	不極成者，謂生死中樂受定無，非極成故，是則有漏亦是樂因。	The third reason is that in samsara, there is definitely no pleasure, because it is not established. In that case, contaminated dharmas are also causes of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b21_3']	以我宗許有樂受故，如何可言諸有漏法唯苦因故，證樂是苦？	以我宗許有樂受故，如何可言諸有漏法唯苦因故，證樂是苦？	Because we admit that there is the experience of pleasure. How can you say that all contaminated dharmas are only causes of suffering, and therefore prove that pleasure is suffering?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b21_12']	故彼所說有言無義。	故彼所說有言無義。	Therefore what they say has words but no meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b23_1']	又應決定有實樂受異於苦受，以苦與樂有愛非愛相差別故。	又應決定有實樂受異於苦受，以苦與樂有愛非愛相差別故。	Also, you must definitely admit that there is a real experience of pleasure that is different from suffering, because there is a difference between the two in that one is loved and the other is not loved.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b24_2']	若謂樂受可愛性不成，以離染時復成非愛故。	若謂樂受可愛性不成，以離染時復成非愛故。	If you say that the nature of pleasure is not established because it becomes unpleasant when one is free from passion,
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b25_1']	此亦非理，於離染時由異門觀為非愛故。	此亦非理，於離染時由異門觀為非愛故。	this is also unreasonable, because when one is free from passion, one views it as unpleasant from a different perspective.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b26_9']	非觀行者觀樂性邊以為非愛，但以餘相厭患樂受，如後當說。	非觀行者觀樂性邊以為非愛，但以餘相厭患樂受，如後當說。	The practitioner does not view the aspect of pleasure as unpleasant, but rather becomes disgusted with pleasant feeling through other characteristics, as will be explained later.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b27_7']	又離苦外實有樂受，以契經中佛說有故。	又離苦外實有樂受，以契經中佛說有故。	Moreover, there really is pleasant feeling apart from pain, because the Buddha said it exists in the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b27_12']	如契經說：	如契經說：	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b28_7']	受有三種，謂樂及苦、不苦不樂。	受有三種，謂樂及苦、不苦不樂。	There are three kinds of feeling, namely pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663b29_6']	若受自性實皆苦者，佛說三受有何勝利？	若受自性實皆苦者，佛說三受有何勝利？	If the intrinsic nature of feeling is all painful, what benefit is there in the Buddha's teaching of the three feelings?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c02_4']	若謂世尊隨世故說，謂世於苦下上中位，如其次第起樂等覺，世尊隨彼說樂等三。	若謂世尊隨世故說，謂世於苦下上中位，如其次第起樂等覺，世尊隨彼說樂等三。	If you say that the World-Honored One taught according to the world, meaning that the world gives rise to the awareness of pleasure, etc. in the lower, higher, and middle states of pain respectively, and the World-Honored One taught the three of pleasure, etc. according to that,
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c02_14']	理亦不然，非極成故。	理亦不然，非極成故。	this is also unreasonable, because it is not universally accepted.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c03_12']	謂第三受世不極成，如何世尊隨世說有？	謂第三受世不極成，如何世尊隨世說有？	The third feeling is not universally accepted in the world, so how can the World-Honored One teach it according to the world?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c04_3']	故說三受唯依真見。	故說三受唯依真見。	Therefore it is said that the three feelings are based only on true seeing.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c05_13']	又於觀樂受，說如實言故，不應隨世說有三受，非下苦受如實是樂。	又於觀樂受，說如實言故，不應隨世說有三受，非下苦受如實是樂。	Also, in speaking of the contemplation of pleasant feeling, the Buddha used the words “in accordance with reality.” Therefore one should not speak of the existence of three feelings in accordance with worldly convention. Lower painful feeling is not really pleasant.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c06_12']	又樂亦有下等三故，不應言樂唯是下苦。	又樂亦有下等三故，不應言樂唯是下苦。	Also, because pleasure also has three kinds, lower, etc., one should not say that pleasure is only lower painful feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c08_3']	又應非福感愛果故，謂非福業許有三品，下品能招下苦受果；	又應非福感愛果故，謂非福業許有三品，下品能招下苦受果；	Also, because non-meritorious action would produce a pleasant result. Non-meritorious action is admitted to be of three grades. The lowest grade can produce a result that is lower painful feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c09_2']	汝言下苦體即是樂，豈不非福應感愛果？	汝言下苦體即是樂，豈不非福應感愛果？	You say that lower painful feeling is in reality pleasure. Would it not be that non-meritorious action would produce a pleasant result?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c10_2']	又如如苦成下品時，如是如是成上品樂；	又如如苦成下品時，如是如是成上品樂；	Also, as painful feeling becomes lower and lower, so pleasure becomes higher and higher.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c11_10']	下品非福既感下苦，汝宗下苦即是上樂，豈不下因能招上果？	下品非福既感下苦，汝宗下苦即是上樂，豈不下因能招上果？	When the lowest grade of non-meritorious action produces the lowest grade of pain, according to your theory, the lowest grade of pain is the highest grade of pleasure. How can a low cause produce a high result?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c11_19']	便與因果感赴理違。	便與因果感赴理違。	This contradicts the principle of the correspondence between cause and result.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c12_17']	又如如苦成下下時，如是如是樂成上上；	又如如苦成下下時，如是如是樂成上上；	Also, as painful feeling becomes lower and lower, so pleasure becomes higher and higher.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c14_7']	是則下下非福為因，能感上上樂受為果，誰復為善、設大功用？	是則下下非福為因，能感上上樂受為果，誰復為善、設大功用？	Then, inferior non-meritorious karma as a cause would be able to produce superior pleasant feeling as a result. Who would then do good and expend great effort?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c15_14']	又福非福各有九品，如何下下非福為因，能感上上樂受為果？	又福非福各有九品，如何下下非福為因，能感上上樂受為果？	Moreover, meritorious and non-meritorious karma each have nine grades. How could inferior non-meritorious karma as a cause produce superior pleasant feeling as a result?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c17_4']	又上上福、下下非福，同感下下苦受為果，則福非福應無差別。	又上上福、下下非福，同感下下苦受為果，則福非福應無差別。	Moreover, superior meritorious karma and inferior non-meritorious karma would both produce inferior painful feeling as a result. Then, meritorious and non-meritorious karma would be without distinction.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c17_13']	於餘八品徵難亦爾。	於餘八品徵難亦爾。	The same objection applies to the other eight grades.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c19_3']	又應一果二因所感，或應許福即是非福，是則違害如來至教。	又應一果二因所感，或應許福即是非福，是則違害如來至教。	Moreover, a single result would be produced by two causes. Or it would be necessary to admit that merit is itself demerit. This would contradict the teachings of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c21_1']	又下三定許有樂受，上地唯有不苦不樂，誰知苦受下下上中，設大劬勞厭下欣上？	又下三定許有樂受，上地唯有不苦不樂，誰知苦受下下上中，設大劬勞厭下欣上？	Moreover, the three lower concentrations are admitted to have pleasant feeling. In the upper stages, there is only neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling. Who knows that painful feeling is inferior, and that superior and middling are superior? Even if one expends great effort, one tires of the inferior and delights in the superior?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c21_20']	又定漸勝、執苦漸增，於非理中誰復過此？	又定漸勝、執苦漸增，於非理中誰復過此？	Moreover, as concentration gradually becomes superior, you hold that pain gradually increases. Who could be more unreasonable than this?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c23_7']	又若下苦即名為樂，樂受領納應不猛利，理非下受領納分明。	又若下苦即名為樂，樂受領納應不猛利，理非下受領納分明。	If a weak suffering is called pleasure, then pleasant feeling would not be a very intense experience, and it would not be reasonable for a weak feeling to be clearly experienced.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c24_6']	執下分明中翻闇昧，誰有智者能忍此執？	執下分明中翻闇昧，誰有智者能忍此執？	If you hold that a weak feeling is clearly experienced, then a medium feeling would be unclearly experienced. Who with intelligence would accept such a doctrine?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c24_15']	故知苦外實有樂受。	故知苦外實有樂受。	Therefore we know that apart from suffering there really is a pleasant feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c27_12']	又彼容起餘執過故，謂若苦樂無異體者，是則容他更起異執，唯許可愛別離位中，於樂受無起於苦覺，無別苦受名餘執過。	又彼容起餘執過故，謂若苦樂無異體者，是則容他更起異執，唯許可愛別離位中，於樂受無起於苦覺，無別苦受名餘執過。	Also, they may give rise to other doctrines that are erroneous. If pleasure and suffering have no different substance, then it is possible for others to give rise to other doctrines. They may say that only the state of separation from what is lovable gives rise to the perception of suffering in the absence of pleasure, and there is no separate suffering. This is an erroneous doctrine.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c29_10']	或容有計唯有樂受是真實有，餘受實無，但於樂受上下中位，如次立為樂等三受。	或容有計唯有樂受是真實有，餘受實無，但於樂受上下中位，如次立為樂等三受。	Or it is possible to hold the view that only the feeling of pleasure really exists and the other feelings do not really exist, and that the three feelings of pleasure, etc., are established in order in the superior, medium, and weak states of the feeling of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0663c29_19']	彼與此執理無別故。	彼與此執理無別故。	This is because their reasoning is no different from the previous doctrine.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664a02_8']	如彼但由自分別力執唯有苦，約品立三，此亦應然，故彼非善。	如彼但由自分別力執唯有苦，約品立三，此亦應然，故彼非善。	Just as they hold that only suffering exists because of the power of their own discrimination, and that the three feelings are established according to the degree of suffering, so it is in this case. Therefore their doctrine is not good.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664a03_15']	又苦樂受定實有異，說六觸處為天、世間及那落迦有差別故。	又苦樂受定實有異，說六觸處為天、世間及那落迦有差別故。	Also, the two feelings of pain and pleasure are definitely real and different, because the scriptures say that the six sense bases are the heavens, the world, and the hells, and there are distinctions among them.

['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664a20_4']	故知樂受自相是樂。	故知樂受自相是樂。	Therefore we know that the intrinsic nature of pleasant feeling is pleasure.

['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664a23_10']	謂我不許唯外境力能生苦樂，若唯境者，初與事業威儀合時，便應發生增上苦受。	謂我不許唯外境力能生苦樂，若唯境者，初與事業威儀合時，便應發生增上苦受。	We do not admit that the power of external objects alone can generate pain and pleasure. If objects alone were the cause, then when one first engages in activities and deportment, one should immediately generate a feeling of extreme pain.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664a24_17']	謂由此境於最後時為緣發生增上苦受，初時已與如是境合。	謂由此境於最後時為緣發生增上苦受，初時已與如是境合。	That is, because these objects at the final moment become the conditions that generate extreme pain, one has already engaged with such objects at the beginning.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664a25_16']	若唯境力生苦樂者，境纔合時應生上苦；	若唯境力生苦樂者，境纔合時應生上苦；	If pain and pleasure were generated by the power of objects alone, then when the object is first encountered, one should generate the highest degree of pain;

['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664a30_2']	謂至所依如是分位，冷煖等觸能為樂因，無至此時非樂因理、為苦因者，理亦應然，故觀別因便令外境為苦樂受各別生因。	謂至所依如是分位，冷煖等觸能為樂因，無至此時非樂因理、為苦因者，理亦應然，故觀別因便令外境為苦樂受各別生因。	That is, when the basis reaches such a state, cold, warm, and other contacts can become the causes of pleasure. There is no principle that when they reach this time, they are not the causes of pleasure. As for being the causes of pain, the principle should be the same. Therefore, observing the separate causes, we make external objects the causes of the generation of each of the feelings of pain and pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664b01_3']	是故不應由事業等後生增上苦，便撥無實樂；	是故不應由事業等後生增上苦，便撥無實樂；	Therefore, you should not deny the existence of real pleasure because of the increased suffering that arises later due to activities, etc.

['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664b05_3']	以經久時身心勞倦，身中便有異大種生，由此後時方生苦受。	以經久時身心勞倦，身中便有異大種生，由此後時方生苦受。	Because after a long time, the body becomes tired and exhausted, and different primary elements arise in the body, which then give rise to the feeling of suffering later.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664b06_11']	以諸外境要待別因，方能為因生苦樂受，故生苦樂因非不定。	以諸外境要待別因，方能為因生苦樂受，故生苦樂因非不定。	Because external objects must depend on other causes in order to be able to be the causes that give rise to the feelings of pleasure and suffering, therefore the causes of the arising of pleasure and suffering are not indeterminate.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664b07_10']	亦不可以後時苦增，便謂初時已生苦受。	亦不可以後時苦增，便謂初時已生苦受。	Also, one cannot say that because suffering increases later, suffering was already produced at the beginning.

['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664b11_2']	先有聖樂微故不知，後時漸增方覺為有。	先有聖樂微故不知，後時漸增方覺為有。	Because the subtle, prior, holy bliss is not known, but later, as it gradually increases, it is perceived as existing.

If there is no real bliss in the three meditative absorptions, then it should not be said that later suffering increases because of the existence of bliss.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664b16_3']	知決定無真實樂受，非畢竟故。	知決定無真實樂受，非畢竟故。	Therefore we know that there definitely is no real blissful feeling, because it is not permanent.

Observing them as coarse hindrances also leads to freedom from attachment.

Therefore, the body that is being harmed by mosquitoes, gadflies, etc., cannot serve as a cause that assists bathing, etc., in producing the feeling of pleasure, because at that time one only feels suffering. One should not deny the existence of pleasure, because when there are causes that assist, pleasure is produced.

This is as explained above.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0664c14_2']	謂見有處所有樂因，唯能生樂曾不生苦，如三靜慮，以於欲界苦著樂微，故遇樂緣不能奪苦。	謂見有處所有樂因，唯能生樂曾不生苦，如三靜慮，以於欲界苦著樂微，故遇樂緣不能奪苦。	That is, we see that there are cases where only the cause of pleasure can produce pleasure and never pain, such as the three trance states. Because in the realm of desire, attachment to pleasure is slight, so when encountering a condition of pleasure, it cannot overcome pain.

The repeated words show that they frequently give rise to heterodox views.

['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a03_7']	一切有為及諸擇滅，以是煩惱聖道境故，染淨因果性差別故。	一切有為及諸擇滅，以是煩惱聖道境故，染淨因果性差別故。	All conditioned dharmas and cessation resulting from discrimination are included in the truths, because they are the objects of both passions and the holy path, because they are the natures of defiled and pure causes and results.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a06_13']	空非擇滅，有自體故、正見境故，亦是諦攝，然非煩惱聖道境故，亦非染淨因果性故，亦非欣厭所行境故，非覺悟彼得成聖故，不預此中聖諦所攝。	空非擇滅，有自體故、正見境故，亦是諦攝，然非煩惱聖道境故，亦非染淨因果性故，亦非欣厭所行境故，非覺悟彼得成聖故，不預此中聖諦所攝。	Space and cessation not resulting from discrimination are included in the truth of suffering, because they have their own nature and are the objects of right views. They are also included in the truth of the path, because they are not the objects of passions and the holy path, because they are not the natures of defiled or pure causes and results, because they are not objects of the practice of disgust, and because one does not become a saint by understanding them.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a07_3']	何緣煩惱不緣彼生？	何緣煩惱不緣彼生？	Why do the passions not arise with regard to these two?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a08_2']	以彼二法是無漏故，不能違害有漏法故。	以彼二法是無漏故，不能違害有漏法故。	Because these two dharmas are pure and cannot violate impure dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a09_10']	謂愛但緣有漏為境，欣無漏法違諸有故，不名為愛是善法欲。	謂愛但緣有漏為境，欣無漏法違諸有故，不名為愛是善法欲。	That is, craving only has impure dharmas as objects, and craving for pure dharmas violates all existence. Therefore it is not called craving but is called desire for good dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a11_7']	若境極能順生貪愛，此境遍是煩惱所緣，由愛所緣便於彼滅，及彼滅道不欲疑謗。	若境極能順生貪愛，此境遍是煩惱所緣，由愛所緣便於彼滅，及彼滅道不欲疑謗。	If an object is able to assist in the generation of craving, then that object is universally the object of the passions. Because of the objects of craving, one does not desire, doubt, or deny cessation with regard to that object, or the path to that cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a12_6']	空非擇滅與此相違，故定不為煩惱境界。	空非擇滅與此相違，故定不為煩惱境界。	Space and non-analytical cessation are the opposite of this, and therefore they definitely are not the objects of defilements.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a13_14']	豈不於二譬喻等師，緣之亦生不欲疑謗，寧說緣彼煩惱不生？	豈不於二譬喻等師，緣之亦生不欲疑謗，寧說緣彼煩惱不生？	Isn't it the case that the teachers of the two similes and so on also give rise to aversion, doubt, and denial in regard to them? How can it be said that defilements do not arise in regard to them?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a14_13']	非緣彼生無智疑見，障證苦滅及苦滅道。	非緣彼生無智疑見，障證苦滅及苦滅道。	It is not that ignorance, doubt, and views arise in regard to them, obstructing the realization of the cessation of suffering and the path to the cessation of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a16_11']	如緣苦等成染污性，如阿羅漢於道路等亦有無智疑謗現行，豈可說為染污煩惱？	如緣苦等成染污性，如阿羅漢於道路等亦有無智疑謗現行，豈可說為染污煩惱？	Just as in the defiled nature in regard to suffering and so on, just as in the arhat there is also the actual manifestation of ignorance, doubt, and denial in regard to roads and so on. How can it be said to be defiled afflictions?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a17_10']	是故皆是不染污性，由此說無緣彼煩惱。	是故皆是不染污性，由此說無緣彼煩惱。	Therefore, they are all of an undefiled nature. For this reason, it is said that there are no afflictions that take them as objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a17_13']	有說：	有說：	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a18_9']	非謗空非擇滅，但謗其名，不緣其體。	非謗空非擇滅，但謗其名，不緣其體。	It is not the case that space and non-analytical cessation are denied, but only their names are denied, not their substance as objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a19_7']	此二唯善俗智境界，於苦等諦何不亦然？	此二唯善俗智境界，於苦等諦何不亦然？	These two are only the objects of conventional knowledge of the wholesome. Why is it not the same in regard to the truths of suffering and so on?
['ZH_T29_1562_058:0668a19_16']	是故應知前說無失。	是故應知前說無失。	Therefore, one should know that the previous explanation is without error.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
