If he were to convey the meaning, the feelings of the assembly would be even more uplifted, so he is addressed first.

If they enter these concentrations, they know others' minds and see the capacities of beings.

Emerging from the true and entering the conventional, there is then mind and speech. This is using a mind of arising and ceasing to speak of the Dharma of true suchness.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626a20_1']	既是生滅，不稱實相，豈以此心而說實相？	既是生滅，不稱實相，豈以此心而說實相？	005	Since it is arising and ceasing, it does not accord with true suchness. How can this mind speak of true suchness?
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626a21_1']	又四義是生、寂滅是滅，如此分別非說實相。	又四義是生、寂滅是滅，如此分別非說實相。	005	Moreover, the four meanings are arising, and quiescent extinction is ceasing. Such discrimination is not speaking of true suchness.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626a22_10']	又出觀心起是生、入觀心忘是滅，實相不爾，何以此心說實相法？	又出觀心起是生、入觀心忘是滅，實相不爾，何以此心說實相法？	005	Moreover, the mind arising from emerging from samādhi is arising, and the mind forgetting from entering samādhi is ceasing. True suchness is not like this. How can this mind speak of the Dharma of true suchness?
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626a23_18']	又旃延因有無入道，還約有無以說五義，生即是有、滅即是無。	又旃延因有無入道，還約有無以說五義，生即是有、滅即是無。	005	Moreover, because of existence and non-existence, Chandaka entered the Way. He still used existence and non-existence to speak of the five meanings. Arising is existence, and ceasing is non-existence.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626a25_7']	所說既是生滅有無，能說必爾，故云「無以生滅心行說實相法」。	所說既是生滅有無，能說必爾，故云「無以生滅心行說實相法」。	005	Since what is spoken is arising and ceasing, existence and non-existence, the speaker must be so. Therefore, it says, Do not use a mind of arising and ceasing to speak of the Dharma of true suchness.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626a27_20']	又聲聞四門五義皆是折法生滅之觀，故《中論》云「為鈍根聲聞說因緣生滅」，是則四門雖異，皆是生滅心行說實相法。	又聲聞四門五義皆是折法生滅之觀，故《中論》云「為鈍根聲聞說因緣生滅」，是則四門雖異，皆是生滅心行說實相法。	005	Moreover, the four gates and five meanings of the śrāvakas are all the contemplation of the arising and ceasing of the deconstructed dharma. Therefore, the Madhyamaka-śāstra says, For the sake of the dull-witted śrāvakas, it is taught that dharmas arise and cease due to causes and conditions. This means that although the four gates are different, they are all the arising and ceasing mind engaging in the teaching of the dharma of ultimate reality.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b03_2']	又旃延非但說法心非，亦不知根。	又旃延非但說法心非，亦不知根。	005	Moreover, not only was Cunda's mind not in accord with the teaching, he also did not know the capacities [of the assembly].

Therefore, the great being scolded him for the arising and ceasing [mind], which lacks the power of fixed wisdom, and for not seeing the other's capacities, and for mistakenly teaching the five meanings that are roundabout and unskillful.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b08_9']	今淨名為說體法五義，非但止通入真亦通中道。	今淨名為說體法五義，非但止通入真亦通中道。	005	Now Vimalakīrti expounds the five meanings of the essence of dharmas, which not only leads to the true through the provisional, but also leads to the middle way.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b10_6']	「諸法畢竟不生不滅是無常義」者，三藏明麁細生滅無常，只是無常，非無常義。	「諸法畢竟不生不滅是無常義」者，三藏明麁細生滅無常，只是無常，非無常義。	005	The ultimate non-arising and non-cessation of all dharmas is the meaning of impermanence - the Tripiṭaka teaches coarse and subtle arising and ceasing as impermanence, which is merely impermanence, not the meaning of impermanence.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b12_5']	若了諸法非生非滅，橫計生滅，故以四句撿生回得即無有滅，是則不生不滅是無常義。	若了諸法非生非滅，橫計生滅，故以四句撿生回得即無有滅，是則不生不滅是無常義。	005	If one understands that all dharmas are neither arising nor ceasing, then the false imputation of arising and ceasing is refuted using the four propositions. Since there is no arising, there is also no ceasing. This is then the meaning of impermanence as non-arising and non-cessation.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b13_21']	「五受陰洞達空無所起是苦義」者，三藏明麁細五陰，此只是苦，非苦義也。	「五受陰洞達空無所起是苦義」者，三藏明麁細五陰，此只是苦，非苦義也。	005	Thoroughly penetrating the emptiness of the five aggregates without arising is the meaning of suffering - the Tripiṭaka teaches coarse and subtle five aggregates, which are merely suffering, not the meaning of suffering.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b14_18']	衍明體達本無麁細，妄計有故，體有即空。	衍明體達本無麁細，妄計有故，體有即空。	005	The Mahāyāna teaches that fundamentally there are no coarse or subtle [aggregates]. Falsely imputed existence is refuted by realizing that existence is empty.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b15_12']	不見苦相名無所起，即是苦義。	不見苦相名無所起，即是苦義。	005	Not seeing the characteristics of suffering is called unoriginated, which is the meaning of suffering.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b18_7']	衍明體此諸法即是實相本來空寂，妄計人法故。	衍明體此諸法即是實相本來空寂，妄計人法故。	005	The Mahāyāna teaches that the essence of these dharmas is precisely the true reality, originally empty and quiescent, because of false conceptualization of persons and dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b19_2']	既言究竟無所有，即不須破折。	既言究竟無所有，即不須破折。	005	Since it is said to be ultimately non-existent, there is no need to break it down.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b20_9']	即是畢竟無所有是真空義也。	即是畢竟無所有是真空義也。	005	This is precisely the meaning of the ultimate non-existence, which is the true emptiness.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b22_1']	「於我無我而不二是無我義」者，三藏明人無我，只是無我，非無我義。	「於我無我而不二是無我義」者，三藏明人無我，只是無我，非無我義。	005	The non-duality between self and non-self is the meaning of non-self means that the Tripiṭaka teaches the non-self of persons, which is merely non-self, not the meaning of non-self.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b23_7']	衍明實相真空本來無有我與無我，妄計有故，說於無我。	衍明實相真空本來無有我與無我，妄計有故，說於無我。	005	The Mahāyāna teaches that the true reality and true emptiness are originally devoid of self and non-self, because of false conceptualization of existence, it speaks of non-self.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b25_3']	若不得我，亦無無我，我與無我本來無二，無二即無性，無性之性即真無我義也。	若不得我，亦無無我，我與無我本來無二，無二即無性，無性之性即真無我義也。	005	If the self is not attained, there is also no non-self. The self and non-self are originally non-dual. Non-duality is non-nature. The nature of non-nature is the true meaning of non-self.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b27_2']	「法本不然今則無滅是寂滅義」者，三藏所明以有還無名寂滅涅槃，只是寂滅，非寂滅義。	「法本不然今則無滅是寂滅義」者，三藏所明以有還無名寂滅涅槃，只是寂滅，非寂滅義。	005	The Dharma is originally non-existent and now there is no cessation. This is the meaning of quiescent extinction. The Tripiṭaka masters explain that existence returning to non-existence is called quiescent extinction nirvāṇa. It is merely quiescent extinction, not the meaning of quiescent extinction.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626b28_12']	衍明諸法從本來常自寂滅相，即大涅槃不可復滅，即真寂滅義也。	衍明諸法從本來常自寂滅相，即大涅槃不可復滅，即真寂滅義也。	005	The Mahāyāna explains that all dharmas from the beginning are always characterized by quiescent extinction, which is great nirvāṇa that cannot be extinguished again. This is the true meaning of quiescent extinction.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c01_6']	而凡夫妄見流動，二乘對治滅之，菩薩體達法本不然，即是真諦寂滅之理。	而凡夫妄見流動，二乘對治滅之，菩薩體達法本不然，即是真諦寂滅之理。	005	However, ordinary beings mistakenly see it as flowing and moving. The two vehicles counteract and extinguish it. Bodhisattvas fundamentally understand that the Dharma is originally non-existent, which is the principle of quiescent extinction of true suchness.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c03_7']	本來無有煩惱生死，今則無因滅果滅之滅諦涅槃，若見生滅真空不二之理即是真滅義。	本來無有煩惱生死，今則無因滅果滅之滅諦涅槃，若見生滅真空不二之理即是真滅義。	005	It has originally never had afflictions and birth and death. Now there is no extinction of causes and effects. The truth of extinction is nirvāṇa. If one sees the principle of non-duality between the arising and ceasing true emptiness, it is the true meaning of extinction.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c03_17']	三藏明五法名義皆異。	三藏明五法名義皆異。	005	The Tripiṭaka masters explain that the names and meanings of the five dharmas are all different.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c07_17']	若破旃延有無縱容明五義者，應云諸法畢竟不生不滅是無常義，何得有無縱容是無常義？	若破旃延有無縱容明五義者，應云諸法畢竟不生不滅是無常義，何得有無縱容是無常義？	005	If one refutes the Mahāyāna's five meanings of existence and non-existence, one should say that all dharmas are ultimately unborn and unceasing, which is the meaning of impermanence. How can existence and non-existence be the meaning of impermanence?

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c10_14']	若破真入中，結真成枯，中自成榮。	若破真入中，結真成枯，中自成榮。	005	If one refutes the true and enters the middle, the conclusion of the true becomes withering, and the middle itself becomes flourishing.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c12_14']	如《涅槃》明二鳥雙遊，常無常俱，真無常義不得離常，故此經明於我無我而不二即真無我義。	如《涅槃》明二鳥雙遊，常無常俱，真無常義不得離常，故此經明於我無我而不二即真無我義。	005	It is like the Nirvana Sutra clarifying that the two birds fly together, permanence and impermanence are both present. The true meaning of impermanence cannot be separated from permanence, so this sutra clarifies the non-duality of self and non-self, which is the true meaning of non-self.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c14_10']	若《大經》明我與無我其性不二，不二之性即真我義，即是無我法中有真我也。	若《大經》明我與無我其性不二，不二之性即真我義，即是無我法中有真我也。	005	If the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says that self and non-self are of the same nature, and the nature of non-duality is the meaning of true self, then there is true self in the Dharma of non-self.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c15_15']	淨名結真明四枯者，意為顯榮，正是方等生蘇教意。	淨名結真明四枯者，意為顯榮，正是方等生蘇教意。	005	Vimokṣa's conclusion of true emptiness and the four kinds of withering is intended to reveal the flourishing, which is precisely the meaning of the teaching of the production of ghee in the Vaipulya [Sūtras].
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c16_15']	出沒未顯，豈得頓同《法華》、《涅槃》？	出沒未顯，豈得頓同《法華》、《涅槃》？	005	The emergence and submergence have not yet been revealed, so how can it be suddenly the same as the Lotus Sūtra and Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra?

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c20_4']	後因大士呵於旃延方廢生滅，用無生五義稱機而說，即便入道。	後因大士呵於旃延方廢生滅，用無生五義稱機而說，即便入道。	005	Later, because the great being scolded Chandaka, he then abandoned arising and ceasing and used the five meanings of non-arising to speak in accordance with the capacities of the audience, and they immediately entered the Way.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0626c23_1']	故《大品》歎羅漢德云「心得好解脫、慧得好解脫」者，即是脫三界思惟，心得自在，具八解脫。	故《大品》歎羅漢德云「心得好解脫、慧得好解脫」者，即是脫三界思惟，心得自在，具八解脫。	005	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra praises the virtues of the arhats, saying the mind attains good liberation, and wisdom attains good liberation. This means being liberated from the thoughts of the three realms and attaining mastery of the mind, possessing the eight liberations.

He remained silent and had no reply. How could he be worthy of transmitting the meaning? Therefore, he declined, saying he was not fit.

The Great Sage, the Dharma King, wishes to enable sentient beings to attain the inconceivable dependent and proper [rewards]. First, he ordered the great disciples to each state their inability. Because the śrāvakas have attained the biased truth and are all stuck in the unconditioned, they each declined [the Buddha's request] and were rebuked.

The inconceivable true Dharma body of the correct reward has not yet been revealed, and the true pure dependent reward of the Buddha land has not yet been accomplished.

How could they fully reveal the spiritual wisdom of Vimalakīrti?

If this teaching was given to benefit people in the Tripiṭaka, it is the secret teaching. If the bodhisattvas heard it separately, it is the indeterminate teaching.

Those who are not rebuked deeply understand the meaning of the teaching, do not cling to views, and have no love for the path, so they do not need to be rebuked.

Now, I will only clarify the differences in teachings.🔽First, the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva, who gives rise to compassion and great vows based on the arising and ceasing four noble truths, gives rise to the bodhi mind, and through the three asaṃkhyeya kalpas and six pāramitās, subdues afflictions and matures, entering the stage of nonretrogression.🔽Second, the bodhisattva of the Shared Teaching, who gives rise to compassion and great vows based on the four noble truths of nonarising, cultivates the six pāramitās of nonarising and severs afflictions within the realm, entering the stage of nonretrogression.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0634c21_11']	三別教大乘，緣無量四諦起慈悲弘誓發菩提心，行無量六度乃至十度斷恒沙無知入阿鞞跋致位。	三別教大乘，緣無量四諦起慈悲弘誓發菩提心，行無量六度乃至十度斷恒沙無知入阿鞞跋致位。	005	Third, the bodhisattva of the Distinct Teaching, who gives rise to compassion and great vows based on the immeasurable four noble truths, practices the immeasurable six pāramitās up to the ten pāramitās, severs the innumerable ignorance, and enters the stage of nonretrogression.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0634c23_17']	四圓教菩薩，緣無作四諦起慈悲弘誓發菩提心，修無作六度乃至十度圓斷法界無明入阿鞞跋致位。	四圓教菩薩，緣無作四諦起慈悲弘誓發菩提心，修無作六度乃至十度圓斷法界無明入阿鞞跋致位。	005	Fourth, the bodhisattvas of the perfect teaching arouse compassion and great vows based on the four truths of non-action, give rise to the mind of enlightenment, cultivate the six perfections up to the ten perfections of non-action, completely sever the ignorance of the Dharma realm, and enter the stage of non-retrogression.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0634c24_15']	發心行位橫竪不同，具如《玄義》。	發心行位橫竪不同，具如《玄義》。	005	The stages of practice and realization are different in terms of horizontal and vertical, as explained in detail in the Profound Meaning.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0634c27_4']	但大聖於四不可說中用四悉檀，赴求佛慧眾生四種根緣，故說四教，明菩薩義三權一實，非權非實而權而實。	但大聖於四不可說中用四悉檀，赴求佛慧眾生四種根緣，故說四教，明菩薩義三權一實，非權非實而權而實。	005	However, the Great Sage, within the four inexpressibles, uses the four siddhāntas to respond to the four kinds of capacities of sentient beings who seek the wisdom of Buddhahood, and therefore expounds the four teachings to clarify the meaning of bodhisattvas, with three provisional and one true, neither provisional nor true yet both provisional and true.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0634c29_8']	今言「菩薩品」者，四大菩薩及諸菩薩悉是釋迦法身眷屬，如來應生赴緣利物，示四佛身說四大乘。	今言「菩薩品」者，四大菩薩及諸菩薩悉是釋迦法身眷屬，如來應生赴緣利物，示四佛身說四大乘。	005	Now, as for the chapter on bodhisattvas, the four great bodhisattvas and all bodhisattvas are all the Dharma body retinue of Śākyamuni. The Tathāgata, in response to conditions, benefits beings by taking birth, manifesting the bodies of the four buddhas and expounding the four great vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a02_6']	法身菩薩亦各隨機所感，示為四種菩薩，輔翼法王引接四緣，各共信受方便三種。	法身菩薩亦各隨機所感，示為四種菩薩，輔翼法王引接四緣，各共信受方便三種。	005	The Dharma body bodhisattvas also each manifest as the four kinds of bodhisattvas in accordance with the capacities of beings they inspire, assisting the Dharma King and guiding the four kinds of conditions, each together believing and accepting the three provisional [teachings].
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a03_18']	道觀稍成欲轉其觀，令學圓教究竟之道，若不先折其師弟子則不可轉。	道觀稍成欲轉其觀，令學圓教究竟之道，若不先折其師弟子則不可轉。	005	The path and contemplation have been slightly accomplished, and he wants to turn their contemplation, causing them to study the ultimate path of the perfect teaching. If he does not first break down their teachers and disciples, then they cannot be turned.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a04_19']	無容佛自說教物，忽自改蹤易轍，是事不可。	無容佛自說教物，忽自改蹤易轍，是事不可。	005	It is not appropriate for the Buddha himself to speak the teachings to transform beings, suddenly changing his tracks and altering his course. This is impossible.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a06_1']	淨名既多示居圓教上地，故得彈呵諸方便上地。	淨名既多示居圓教上地，故得彈呵諸方便上地。	005	Since Vimalakīrti often manifests dwelling in the upper grounds of the perfect teaching, he is able to rebuke and admonish the superior grounds of the expedient teachings.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a10_2']	方便上地既各示受屈，其諸眷屬住方便者即執心內折，自鄙所行未是真極，莫不仰慕圓真大道，或即發圓心或豁然開朗得真實無生，如此皆由四大菩薩及諸大士方便善誘。	方便上地既各示受屈，其諸眷屬住方便者即執心內折，自鄙所行未是真極，莫不仰慕圓真大道，或即發圓心或豁然開朗得真實無生，如此皆由四大菩薩及諸大士方便善誘。	005	Since the superior grounds of the expedient teachings each manifest receiving humiliation, the various retinues dwelling in the expedient teachings immediately fold their minds inwardly, feeling ashamed that their practice is not yet the true ultimate. None do not look up to the perfect true great path, either immediately giving rise to the perfect mind or suddenly becoming enlightened and attaining true non-arising. In this way, it is all due to the skillful guidance of the four great bodhisattvas and the great beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a11_10']	今命問疾，若各述被彈，即重益時眾成五種利益，故言菩薩品。	今命問疾，若各述被彈，即重益時眾成五種利益，故言菩薩品。	005	Now, if he is ordered to inquire about his illness and each relates being rebuked, then it will greatly benefit the assembly and accomplish the five kinds of benefits, and thus it is called the Chapter on Bodhisattvas.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a16_20']	同是實隣果，如《仁王般若》云「十地有三生」，諸菩薩是始生、住生，淨名是終生，於諸菩薩為勝也。	同是實隣果，如《仁王般若》云「十地有三生」，諸菩薩是始生、住生，淨名是終生，於諸菩薩為勝也。	005	They are both truly close to the fruit. As the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra for Humane Kings says, The ten grounds have three births. The bodhisattvas are those of the beginning, abiding, and final births. Vimalakīrti is the final birth, and thus superior among the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a18_10']	今當實判，諸菩薩與淨名皆有本迹同權同實，但是共來輔佛成熟眾生。	今當實判，諸菩薩與淨名皆有本迹同權同實，但是共來輔佛成熟眾生。	005	Now I will truly judge. The bodhisattvas and Vimalakīrti both have fundamental and provisional aspects, and are the same in being provisional and the same in being real. They simply come together to assist the Buddha in bringing sentient beings to maturity.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a19_19']	四大士等沒實用權輔成權教，淨名、鴦掘沒權用實輔成實教。	四大士等沒實用權輔成權教，淨名、鴦掘沒權用實輔成實教。	005	The four great beings and so forth use the provisional to assist in establishing the provisional teachings. Vimalakīrti and Aṅgulimāla use the real to assist in establishing the real teachings.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a20_14']	權者如砧、實者如槌，成眾生器。	權者如砧、實者如槌，成眾生器。	005	The provisional is like a hammer, and the real is like a mallet, forming the vessels of sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a21_3']	若論益物，權實俱益。	若論益物，權實俱益。	005	If we discuss benefiting beings, both provisional and real benefit.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635a23_7']	若論扣擊，槌彈砧受俱不思議，共利眾生，尚非二乘諸小菩薩所知，豈是博地凡夫能知本迹高下。	若論扣擊，槌彈砧受俱不思議，共利眾生，尚非二乘諸小菩薩所知，豈是博地凡夫能知本迹高下。	005	If we discuss striking, both hammer and mallet, anvil and receiver are inconceivable, together benefiting beings, still not known by the two vehicles and lesser bodhisattvas, how could it be known by ordinary worldlings? The heights and depths of the original and traces.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635b03_3']	故云「一切眾生即菩提相」，此恐是十住之相。	故云「一切眾生即菩提相」，此恐是十住之相。	005	Therefore, he said, All sentient beings are the characteristics of bodhi, fearing this might be the characteristics of the ten abodes.

['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635b07_3']	次呵持世，令知魔界佛界一如無二，魔家眷屬修無盡燈即是事理無礙，魔事佛事善惡融通，此恐擬悟迴向之相。	次呵持世，令知魔界佛界一如無二，魔家眷屬修無盡燈即是事理無礙，魔事佛事善惡融通，此恐擬悟迴向之相。	005	Next, he rebuked Zhi Shi, causing him to know that the demon realm and the Buddha realm are one and the same, without duality. The endless lamp cultivated by the demon's family and retinue is precisely the unobstructedness of phenomena and principle, and the good and evil of demon affairs and Buddha affairs are harmoniously integrated. This might involve realizing the characteristics of the ten dedications.
['ZH_T38_1778_005:0635b09_7']	次呵善得，行檀高下不二，財中具法，上奉難勝下濟乞人，悲敬無差名法施會，此恐擬入十地之相。	次呵善得，行檀高下不二，財中具法，上奉難勝下濟乞人，悲敬無差名法施會，此恐擬入十地之相。	005	Next, he rebuked Shan De, causing him to know that the high and low practices of giving are non-dual, and that the Dharma is contained within wealth. Above, he respectfully offered to the Buddha Nan Sheng; below, he saved the beggars. Compassion and respect are without difference, called the Dharma offering assembly. This might involve entering the characteristics of the ten grounds.

Those who receive the perfect teachings but do not understand the meaning cling to the words, and their attachment to the Dharma naturally disappears.

Now, the perfect teaching is submerged and the three remain. This means that those who receive the Buddha's expedient teachings all revere Maitreya.

The Dharma body's own practice and the reward body's transformation of others will certainly accomplish the eternally abiding Buddha fruit.

Whether it is wisdom or elimination, it is the non-arising forbearance of dharmas of the bodhisattva of the perfect teaching, which is the prediction of non-arising of the perfect teaching.
