They also do not become attached to the location of life. This is called the liberation of the practice of faith.

They also do not see the characteristics of the mind, and are able to know that the six elements, aggregates, and sense bases are all equal and the same as the dharma realm. Because they are without discrimination, they know that the dharma realm has no different characteristics. This is called the faith-giving.
