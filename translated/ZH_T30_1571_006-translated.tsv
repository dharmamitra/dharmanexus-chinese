Next, if it is as you say, the characteristics of dharmas exist conventionally, while the principle of ultimate truth is empty. The Tathāgata's wisdom and insight are unobstructed in this regard, and his speech and eloquence skillfully understand others' minds. How is it that the world is still bewitched by various false views and disputes are rife?

['ZH_T30_1571_006:0215c23_11']	要具三德名為法器：	要具三德名為法器：	006	One must possess three virtues to be called a Dharma vessel:
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0215c24_12']	一者稟性柔和無有偏黨，恒自審察不貪己見；	一者稟性柔和無有偏黨，恒自審察不貪己見；	006	First, one's nature is gentle and free from partiality, always self-reflective and not greedy for one's own views;
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0215c25_13']	二者常希勝解求法無厭，不守己分而生喜足；	二者常希勝解求法無厭，不守己分而生喜足；	006	Second, one always aspires for superior understanding and seeks the Dharma without weariness, not guarding one's own portion and giving rise to satisfaction;
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0215c26_14']	三者為性聰慧，於善惡言能正了知德失差別。	三者為性聰慧，於善惡言能正了知德失差別。	006	Third, one's nature is intelligent, and one is able to correctly understand the distinctions between good and evil words and virtues and faults.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0215c27_13']	若無如是所說三德，雖有師資終無勝利。	若無如是所說三德，雖有師資終無勝利。	006	If one lacks the three virtues as described above, even if there is a teacher and disciple, there will ultimately be no benefit.

['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a02_8']	如彼六師諸外道等，雖聞正法而無所證，非佛於彼無愍濟心，亦非聖教不中正理，以於世間所應度者，聞佛聖教皆已度訖。	如彼六師諸外道等，雖聞正法而無所證，非佛於彼無愍濟心，亦非聖教不中正理，以於世間所應度者，聞佛聖教皆已度訖。	006	Like the six teachers and other non-Buddhists, although they hear the correct Dharma, they have nothing to realize. It is not that the Buddha has no compassionate mind towards them, nor is it that the holy teachings are not of correct principles. It is because those who should be liberated in the world have all been liberated by hearing the Buddha's holy teachings.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a02_18']	為顯此義，故次頌曰：	為顯此義，故次頌曰：	006	In order to illustrate this meaning, the following verse is spoken:

['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a06_11']	諸佛如來無礙智見，觀利他事不過四種，謂所捨、證及此二因。	諸佛如來無礙智見，觀利他事不過四種，謂所捨、證及此二因。	006	The unobstructed wisdom and insight of all Buddha-Tathāgatas observes that the affairs of benefiting others do not go beyond four types, namely, what is abandoned, what is realized, and the causes of these two.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a07_8']	體義皆真名言非謬，即是四諦聖教所攝。	體義皆真名言非謬，即是四諦聖教所攝。	006	The essence and meaning are all true, and the words are not false, which is precisely what is included in the four noble truths and the teachings of the sages.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a08_8']	佛雖廣說而彼不知，過在世間，非牟尼失。	佛雖廣說而彼不知，過在世間，非牟尼失。	006	Although the Buddha extensively explains, they do not understand. The fault lies with the worldly, not with the Sage.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a09_6']	以諸外道覺慧庸微，及闕正修故不能解。	以諸外道覺慧庸微，及闕正修故不能解。	006	Because the awareness and wisdom of all non-Buddhists are mediocre and weak, and they lack proper cultivation, therefore they are unable to understand.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a10_5']	如彼烈日放千光明，盲者不見於日無咎。	如彼烈日放千光明，盲者不見於日無咎。	006	It is like the blazing sun emitting a thousand lights, but the blind cannot see. The fault lies with the sun.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a12_10']	復次彼諸外道定為無明放逸睡眠纏覆心識，於自所許不能信依。	復次彼諸外道定為無明放逸睡眠纏覆心識，於自所許不能信依。	006	Furthermore, the minds and consciousness of all non-Buddhists are certainly covered by ignorance, heedlessness, and sloth. They cannot believe in and rely on what they themselves accept.

['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a18_19']	諸外道宗皆言棄捨我所有事，唯我獨存遠離󰊋纏，蕭然解脫無為惔怕名曰涅槃，離相真空絕諸妄境，亦無分別執有等心。	諸外道宗皆言棄捨我所有事，唯我獨存遠離󰊋纏，蕭然解脫無為惔怕名曰涅槃，離相真空絕諸妄境，亦無分別執有等心。	006	All the schools of non-Buddhists say that abandoning one's own affairs, only existing alone, far removed from entanglements, peacefully liberated, unconditioned, and tranquil is called nirvāṇa. Devoid of characteristics, the true emptiness transcends all false realms, and there is also no discriminating mind that grasps at existence, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a20_16']	觀此能除一切心境，正歸無上大般涅槃，不違汝等所求解脫，如何憎背而不生欣？	觀此能除一切心境，正歸無上大般涅槃，不違汝等所求解脫，如何憎背而不生欣？	006	Contemplating this can eliminate all mind and objects, truly returning to the unsurpassed great nirvāṇa. It does not contradict the liberation that you seek. Why do you hate and turn away from it, not giving rise to joy?
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a21_16']	我等涅槃唯除我所，空亦破我，知何所欣？	我等涅槃唯除我所，空亦破我，知何所欣？	006	We say that nirvāṇa only eliminates one's own affairs. Emptiness also destroys the self. Knowing what is there to rejoice in?
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a22_15']	汝涅槃中若有我者，必不離所，何成涅槃？	汝涅槃中若有我者，必不離所，何成涅槃？	006	If there is a self in your nirvāṇa, it must not be apart from what is grasped. How can it be nirvāṇa?
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a23_13']	我如前破，不應重執，故當欣此離我真空。	我如前破，不應重執，故當欣此離我真空。	006	I have already refuted the self before. You should not grasp it again. Therefore, one should rejoice in this true emptiness devoid of self.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a24_3']	有則可除，空無能遣。	有則可除，空無能遣。	006	What exists can be eliminated, but emptiness cannot be dispelled.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a25_12']	執有起過觀空即除，空有二途德失懸隔，云何汝等黨有誹空？	執有起過觀空即除，空有二途德失懸隔，云何汝等黨有誹空？	006	Grasping at existence gives rise to faults. Contemplating emptiness immediately eliminates them. The two paths of existence and emptiness have vastly different merits and demerits. Why do you, [followers of non-Buddhist paths], side with existence and slander emptiness?
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a27_10']	可愍邪徒癡狂無智，不能信受有益真空，常好邪求無益妄有，而於正教反生嫌嫉。	可愍邪徒癡狂無智，不能信受有益真空，常好邪求無益妄有，而於正教反生嫌嫉。	006	It is pitiful that the deluded and ignorant of the heterodox path cannot believe and accept the beneficial true emptiness, but always delight in seeking the harmful false existence, and give rise to resentment towards the correct teachings.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216a29_7']	如彼惡子婬亂迷心，耽媔色聲猖蹶無禮，於母慈訓不知敬從，自任凶頑反生怨害。	如彼惡子婬亂迷心，耽媔色聲猖蹶無禮，於母慈訓不知敬從，自任凶頑反生怨害。	006	It is like that evil child whose mind is confused by lust and disorder, who indulges in form and sound, runs wild without propriety, does not know to respect and follow the kind instructions of his mother, considers himself to be fierce and stubborn, and on the contrary gives rise to resentment and harm.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b01_15']	復次若離真空，畢竟無別捨證方便。	復次若離真空，畢竟無別捨證方便。	006	Furthermore, if one departs from true emptiness, there is ultimately no other method of abandonment and realization.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b02_1']	故次頌曰：	故次頌曰：	006	Therefore, the next verse says:
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b03_14']	「不知捨證因，　　無由能捨證；	「不知捨證因，　　無由能捨證；	006	Not knowing the cause of abandonment and realization, there is no way to abandon and realize;
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b04_13']	是故牟尼說，　　清涼餘定無。	是故牟尼說，　　清涼餘定無。	006	Therefore, the Sage has said that apart from the cool and refreshing [meditation], there is no other [means of] cessation.

['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b06_19']	彼諸外道雖復發心求證涅槃及捨生死，由不善知捨證方便，於所捨證終不能成。	彼諸外道雖復發心求證涅槃及捨生死，由不善知捨證方便，於所捨證終不能成。	006	Although those non-Buddhists give rise to the aspiration to seek and realize nirvana and abandon saṃsāra, because they do not skillfully understand the method of abandonment and realization, they will ultimately be unable to accomplish the abandonment and realization.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b08_16']	憎背真空耽著妄有，故於方便名不善知，除真空觀，無捨生死及證涅槃別方便故。	憎背真空耽著妄有，故於方便名不善知，除真空觀，無捨生死及證涅槃別方便故。	006	Because they hate the true void and are attached to false existence, they are said to be not skilled in skillful means. Except for the contemplation of true void, there are no other skillful means for abandoning birth and death and realizing nirvana.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b09_15']	諸有貪求外道見者，終不能得出世清涼。	諸有貪求外道見者，終不能得出世清涼。	006	Those who greedily seek the views of non-Buddhists will never be able to attain the worldly coolness.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b10_14']	言清涼者，則是一切苦及苦因究竟寂靜。	言清涼者，則是一切苦及苦因究竟寂靜。	006	The term coolness refers to the ultimate tranquility of all suffering and the causes of suffering.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b11_13']	唯有空觀是證得因，除此更無別方便故。	唯有空觀是證得因，除此更無別方便故。	006	Only the contemplation of emptiness is the cause for realization. Apart from this, there are no other skillful means.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b13_12']	如是空觀佛法中有，一切外道邪論所無，故牟尼說四沙門果，我法中有，餘法定無。	如是空觀佛法中有，一切外道邪論所無，故牟尼說四沙門果，我法中有，餘法定無。	006	Such contemplation of emptiness exists within the Buddha Dharma, but it is absent in all the false theories of non-Buddhists. Therefore, the Sage has said that the four fruits of the śramaṇa exist in my teachings but are definitely absent in other teachings.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b14_10']	以諸外道執著己見，誹空觀故不證涅槃。	以諸外道執著己見，誹空觀故不證涅槃。	006	Because non-Buddhists are attached to their own views and slander the contemplation of emptiness, they do not realize nirvana.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b15_8']	云何應知我等所執定非捨證正方便耶？	云何應知我等所執定非捨證正方便耶？	006	How should we know that what we uphold is definitely not the correct skillful means for abandoning and realizing?
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b16_13']	前已具說，執常句義立實有時，皆有過失，後當廣破。	前已具說，執常句義立實有時，皆有過失，後當廣破。	006	It has already been fully explained that when establishing the meaning of permanence, there are faults in all cases of positing reality. This will be extensively refuted later.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b17_6']	執根境等，故知汝執非正方便。	執根境等，故知汝執非正方便。	006	Therefore, we know that your assertion is not a correct method.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b19_4']	又諸外道於涅槃處，實不能離我所見等，而謂彼處有自內我，解脫我所名為涅槃。	又諸外道於涅槃處，實不能離我所見等，而謂彼處有自內我，解脫我所名為涅槃。	006	Moreover, non-Buddhists, in regard to nirvana, are truly unable to abandon the view of mine, etc., yet they say that in that place there is an inner self, and the liberation from the self and mine is called nirvana.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b19_9']	所以者何？	所以者何？	006	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b20_3']	我與我所畢竟無有相離義故。	我與我所畢竟無有相離義故。	006	Because there is no meaning of separation between the self and the self and mine.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b21_11']	汝不可言苦樂等法，於涅槃處遠離於我，汝自立為我所有故。	汝不可言苦樂等法，於涅槃處遠離於我，汝自立為我所有故。	006	You cannot say that the dharmas of suffering, happiness, etc., are far removed from the self in nirvana, because you establish them as belonging to the self.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b22_19']	如汝所執我之自體，亦不可言我之自體非我所有，同喻無因。	如汝所執我之自體，亦不可言我之自體非我所有，同喻無因。	006	As for the intrinsic nature of the self that you assert, it also cannot be said that the intrinsic nature of the self is not belonging to the self, because the example is without a cause.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b23_18']	勿汝所執我無自體，便似空華，有違宗過。	勿汝所執我無自體，便似空華，有違宗過。	006	Do not let the self that you assert be without intrinsic nature, and then resemble a sky flower, with the fault of contradicting your own tenets.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b25_15']	是故汝等外道所執，不能究竟捨離生死，亦不能證究竟涅槃，由此應知非正方便。	是故汝等外道所執，不能究竟捨離生死，亦不能證究竟涅槃，由此應知非正方便。	006	Therefore, the self that you non-Buddhists assert is unable to ultimately abandon birth and death, and also is unable to realize ultimate nirvana. For this reason, you should understand that it is not a correct method.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b27_19']	復次諸外道等製造書論，雖彼所詮少分有實，謂說施等是牽引因，能招善趣及餘勝樂；	復次諸外道等製造書論，雖彼所詮少分有實，謂說施等是牽引因，能招善趣及餘勝樂；	006	Moreover, the treatises composed by non-Buddhists, although they have some truth in their explanations, such as saying that giving and so forth are the causes that attract and can lead to good destinies and other excellent happiness;
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216b28_17']	又說殺等是牽引因，能招惡趣及餘劇苦。	又說殺等是牽引因，能招惡趣及餘劇苦。	006	and also saying that killing and so forth are the causes that attract and can lead to evil destinies and other severe suffering.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216c01_15']	然彼書論前後相違，亦復許為殺生等業，又能引發諸惡見趣，亦從如是見趣所生。	然彼書論前後相違，亦復許為殺生等業，又能引發諸惡見趣，亦從如是見趣所生。	006	However, those treatises contradict each other before and after, and they also allow for the karma of killing and so forth, which can also give rise to various evil views and the paths of those views.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216c02_14']	如有盲人遇遊正道，或時迷失復履邪途。	如有盲人遇遊正道，或時迷失復履邪途。	006	It is like a blind person encountering the correct path while traveling, who sometimes becomes confused and lost, and again treads the wrong path.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216c03_13']	外道書論亦復如是，有實有虛不可依信。	外道書論亦復如是，有實有虛不可依信。	006	The treatises of non-Buddhists are also like this, having both truth and falsehood, and cannot be relied upon for faith.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216c05_11']	若爾如來三藏聖教，或有所說難可信解，是則一切內外經書無可信者，成太過失。	若爾如來三藏聖教，或有所說難可信解，是則一切內外經書無可信者，成太過失。	006	If that is so, then the holy teachings of the three baskets of the Tathāgata may have some explanations that are difficult to believe and understand, and then all the internal and external scriptures will have nothing to be trusted, resulting in the fault of going too far.
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216c05_16']	所以者何？	所以者何？	006	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1571_006:0216c07_10']	佛經中說種種神變不可思議，又說甚深真實義理，諸有情類不能測量。	佛經中說種種神變不可思議，又說甚深真實義理，諸有情類不能測量。	006	The Buddha's sutras speak of various supernatural transformations that are inconceivable, and also of the extremely profound and true principles that sentient beings are unable to fathom.
