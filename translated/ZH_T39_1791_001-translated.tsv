There was a city lord named Rāvaṇa, who rode in his palace to meet the Venerable One's countenance, played music to pray for the wonderful Dharma, used the cresting peak to express his aspirations, and pointed to the ocean of treasures to clarify the essence.

It extensively illustrates the profound meaning and clearly illuminates the deep principles, neither arising nor ceasing, neither existent nor non-existent, cutting off the two paths of coming and going, and abandoning the dualistic grasping of annihilation and permanence, using the ultimate truth to attain the most supreme and wonderful treasure.

The three natures are all empty, and the two kinds of no-self are both extinguished. Enter the treasury of the Tathāgata and roam the gate of liberation.

In the first year of the Yongshou era, the year gengzi, the Lin Zhong calendar, the Yandi Emperor presiding over the constellations, at that time avoiding the summer heat on Jifeng, observing the wind at Ying Water, in the San Yang Palace, I reissued this sutra, investigating the essential teachings of the three versions, forming the complete teaching of seven scrolls.

Looking at the four unobstructed abilities, I am full of shame; gazing at the One Vehicle, I am at a loss. It is difficult to refuse the request of the secular world, so I forcefully compose this literary text with my brush. My words are clumsy and my reasoning is flawed, adding to my deep shame and embarrassment.

['ZH_T39_1791_001:0434a19_15']	欲明達境心空，海亦自寂，心境俱寂，事無不照，猶如大海無風，日月森羅，煥然明白。	欲明達境心空，海亦自寂，心境俱寂，事無不照，猶如大海無風，日月森羅，煥然明白。	It is to clarify that when the mind is empty of objects, the ocean also becomes still by itself. When both mind and objects are still, nothing is not illuminated, just as when the great ocean is without wind, the sun, moon, and myriad phenomena are all clearly visible.
