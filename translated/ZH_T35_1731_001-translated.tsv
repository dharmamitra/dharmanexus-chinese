They only see Sudatta's Jetavana and do not see the Jetavana of the Dharma realm, they only see Śākyamuni's enjoyment and do not see Mahāvairocana's enjoyment, they only see the assembly of the three vehicles and do not see the assembly of bodhisattvas alone, they only see the teachings of the three vehicles and do not see the single great teaching.

Not only do they not see the traces of Śākyamuni and Vairocana, but they also do not see the origin of Vairocana and Śākyamuni. Not only do they not see the defiled and pure of the leaves and platform, but they also do not see the pure and defiled of the platform and leaves.
['ZH_T35_1731_001:0008c04_9']	所以不見二身兩土者，彼無二慧故。	所以不見二身兩土者，彼無二慧故。	001	The reason why they do not see the two bodies and two lands is because they do not have the two wisdoms.

['ZH_T35_1731_001:0008c13_18']	言知而不見者，此句正取前菩薩見淨不見穢義。	言知而不見者，此句正取前菩薩見淨不見穢義。	001	As for knowing but not seeing, this sentence correctly takes the meaning of bodhisattvas seeing the pure and not seeing the defiled.
['ZH_T35_1731_001:0008c15_16']	所以言菩薩知而不見，菩薩知聲聞以顛倒斷常業感得丘墟不淨土，知彼見此土。	所以言菩薩知而不見，菩薩知聲聞以顛倒斷常業感得丘墟不淨土，知彼見此土。	001	Therefore, it is said that bodhisattvas know but do not see. Bodhisattvas know that śrāvakas, due to the karmic retribution of inverted views of permanence and annihilation, attain a land that is uneven and impure, and they know that they see this land.
['ZH_T35_1731_001:0008c16_17']	而菩薩土，而菩薩淨業淨心而不見彼所見土。	而菩薩土，而菩薩淨業淨心而不見彼所見土。	001	But the land of bodhisattvas is a pure land of pure karma and mind, and they do not see the land seen by them.

The true Dharma is neither the original nor the trace, and is one Buddha. Neither the original nor the trace is the original and the trace, and is the two places.

['ZH_T35_1731_001:0010c12_1']	一佛一見者，法身佛非本非迹，緣如法身而見，故是一佛一見也。	一佛一見者，法身佛非本非迹，緣如法身而見，故是一佛一見也。	001	As for one Buddha and one seeing, the Dharma-body Buddha is neither the original nor the traces. Seeing in accordance with the Dharma-body is thus one Buddha and one seeing.

['ZH_T35_1731_001:0010c13_9']	既本迹赴緣，緣則見本迹。	既本迹赴緣，緣則見本迹。	001	Since the original and traces respond to conditions, conditions then see the original and traces.

['ZH_T35_1731_001:0010c20_6']	此則一釋迦在淨穢等處。	此則一釋迦在淨穢等處。	001	This means that a single Śākyamuni is present in both pure and defiled realms.

Since Śākyamuni's defiled land already has a pure land, Amitâbha's pure land also has a defiled land. Therefore, it is said that a single Buddha is present in many places.

Śākyamuni's ability to transform fully elucidates cause and effect, while Mahāvairocana's ability to transform clarifies the effect but not the cause.
['ZH_T35_1731_001:0012a20_16']	舍那所化具明因果，釋迦所化但明因、不明果。	舍那所化具明因果，釋迦所化但明因、不明果。	001	Mahāvairocana's transformation fully elucidates cause and effect, while Śākyamuni's transformation only clarifies the cause but not the effect.

It fully clarifies the causes and effects of the two worlds, so it is the clarification of causes and the discussion of effects. The attainment of perfect enlightenment under the bodhi tree is precisely the discussion of effects, so it is said that Śākyamuni's ability to transform fully clarifies causes and effects.

This is the mutual relationship between ability and object, where there is no ability without accomplishing the object, and no object without accomplishing the ability. Ability is the ability of the object, and the object is the object of the ability. This ability and object are all endowed with cause and effect.

Using the effect of the ability to combine with the cause of the object, and using the cause of the object to combine with the cause of the ability, this ability and object are also the meaning of one cause and one effect.

Shakyamuni can be the primary and Vairocana can be the primary. Shakyamuni can have the meaning of one and two, and Vairocana can have the meaning of two and one. These two are one and two, and this one is two and one. This primary is the trace primary, and this trace is the primary trace. Because of the primary and trace, there is one and two, and because of the trace primary, there is two and one. One and two combine with two and one, and two and one combine with one and two. Because of the primary and trace combining with the trace primary, the trace primary combines with the primary trace.

The original is not the trace, the trace is not the original. One and two are not two, two and one are not one. The able and transformed are not the transformed, the able and transformed are not the able. This is neither one nor two, neither original nor trace, ultimately pure.

It clarifies that this sutra initially only speaks of Vairocana's two results of依正. The ten buddha lands are the result of依, and the ocean of the ten buddha worlds is the result of正.
