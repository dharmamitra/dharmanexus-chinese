The Buddha then revealed the traces and resolved the doubts, saying that in the past they gave rise to the great aspiration together with him and were thus classmates. He surpassed them and became a buddha first due to his diligence, while they still upheld the sūtra due to their extensive learning. Their traces were as attendants, but their original grounds were like this. Now that they have received the wonderful prediction, what is there to doubt?

Discussing them separately, verbal action is teaching others, while physical and mental actions are one's own practice. Discussing them comprehensively, the three actions are one's own standard, which is the Dharma teacher of one's own practice.

Compassionately covering beings and benefiting oneself is called the Tathāgata's room. Preventing others' evil and blocking one's own ugliness is called the robe. Settling the mind in emptiness, one is able to settle others. Settling others and settling oneself is called the seat. This is oneself following the three dharmas and is also called the Dharma master.

['ZH_T34_1718_08a:0108b26_16']	法者軌則也，師者訓匠也，法雖可軌，體不自弘，通之在人，五種通經皆得稱師，舉法成其自行，皆以妙法為師，師於妙法自行成就，故言法師。	法者軌則也，師者訓匠也，法雖可軌，體不自弘，通之在人，五種通經皆得稱師，舉法成其自行，皆以妙法為師，師於妙法自行成就，故言法師。	08a	The Dharma is the standard, and the teacher is the one who instructs and guides. Although the Dharma can be the standard, its essence cannot be widely promoted by itself. Its transmission lies in people. All five types of people who transmit the sutra can be called teachers. Upholding the Dharma accomplishes one's own practice. All use the wonderful Dharma as the teacher. The teacher of the wonderful Dharma accomplishes one's own practice, so it is called the Dharma teacher.

After the main teaching, understanding, and receiving of the predictions is finished, the following five chapters are the circulation of the chapter on traces. It is not only to benefit the present time, but also to moisten the future world, thus there is the circulation of the five chapters.

Considering their own weakness to be of no benefit to themselves or others, they give rise to discouragement. The Buddha speaks the chapter on ease and comfort for these people, and if they rely on it to spread the Dharma, they need not worry about danger or suffering.
