['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0316b02_4']	故至釋此品，應委騰前四品之意，謂法師下三，通以法師室衣座三，為流通之軌，故釋前三品題及以消文，咸依此三明品元意，若隨文相別生起不同文起盡耳。	故至釋此品，應委騰前四品之意，謂法師下三，通以法師室衣座三，為流通之軌，故釋前三品題及以消文，咸依此三明品元意，若隨文相別生起不同文起盡耳。	09a	Therefore, in explaining this chapter, one should thoroughly explain the meaning of the previous four chapters. The three chapters below Dharma Master generally use the three of the Dharma Master's room, robe, and seat as the standard for circulation, so the titles of the previous three chapters are explained and the text is eliminated, all relying on these three to clarify the original meaning of the chapter. If it follows the textual characteristics and arises differently, the text ends there.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0316b03_13']	以〈法師品〉是流通之始，是故具列三法為軌，況流通者演布正說？	以〈法師品〉是流通之始，是故具列三法為軌，況流通者演布正說？	09a	Since the Dharma Master Chapter is the beginning of circulation, it lists the three dharmas as the standard. Moreover, circulation is the spreading of the correct teaching?
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0316b05_13']	故令說者依三建志，方能光顯所弘之典，令物慕仰法可弘通，冥資顯益是如來使。	故令說者依三建志，方能光顯所弘之典，令物慕仰法可弘通，冥資顯益是如來使。	09a	Therefore, the expounder should rely on the three to establish his will, only then can he glorify the scriptures he propagates, causing beings to revere and admire the Dharma that can be widely spread, and secretly benefit and be nourished by the Tathāgata's emissaries.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0316b07_14']	若不爾者，何故世尊命弘經人，量其功用堪掌任者，故使此土他土上方下方進否異轍。	若不爾者，何故世尊命弘經人，量其功用堪掌任者，故使此土他土上方下方進否異轍。	09a	If it were not so, why would the World-Honored One order those who propagate the sūtra to measure their abilities and those who are capable of handling the responsibility? Therefore, in this land and other lands, in the upper and lower directions, there are different approaches to progress and retreat.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0316b12_2']	若己自行不長物信，如熱病者而貨冷藥，是故不可率爾傳經，故三周開顯若法若喻不逾三德，若修若性準而則之，性德不當開與不開，修德隨時轉名赴物，在今同異無非一乘。	若己自行不長物信，如熱病者而貨冷藥，是故不可率爾傳經，故三周開顯若法若喻不逾三德，若修若性準而則之，性德不當開與不開，修德隨時轉名赴物，在今同異無非一乘。	09a	If one's own practice does not increase the faith of others, it is like a person with a fever selling cold medicine. Therefore, one should not rashly transmit the sūtra. Therefore, in the three periods of opening and revealing, whether it is the Dharma or parables, they do not go beyond the three virtues. Whether it is cultivation or nature, they are in accordance with it. The nature virtues should not be opened or not opened. The cultivation virtues change their names according to the times to accord with beings. Whether in the present or different, they are all the One Vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0316b14_17']	故流通之首還約此藏以之為軌，所以法師名室衣座，以於敷弘義便故也。	故流通之首還約此藏以之為軌，所以法師名室衣座，以於敷弘義便故也。	09a	Therefore, at the beginning of the chapter on circulation, it still takes this treasury as the standard. This is why the Dharma master's name, room, robe, and seat are used, because they are convenient for expounding the meaning.

If one's body is the bed and seat of Devadatta, if one does not deeply understand these three, how can one lightly regard one's life and value the Dharma?

The explanation lists and explains in the middle. In the explanation, each first clarifies the appearance of practice, next clarifies what is to be avoided, and third concludes the meaning.

Therefore, the following extensively explains the four phrases from external paths and so on, as well as the absolute negation. The absolute negation also abandons, so there are five non-acceptances, up to the four gates and absolute negation of the perfect teaching.

Discussing it in terms of essence, it should be further distinguished. Since the names of joy are the same, it is only used to distinguish them with biased and perfect.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c07_3']	四行既是三業止觀及以弘誓，俱行俱運止觀同時，況一一行攝一切行，況前初品衣座室三無三差別，故無次第。	四行既是三業止觀及以弘誓，俱行俱運止觀同時，況一一行攝一切行，況前初品衣座室三無三差別，故無次第。	09a	Since the four practices are the cessation and contemplation of the three karmas and the great vows, the cessation and contemplation are practiced and carried out together at the same time. How much more so is each practice inclusive of all practices? How much more so is there no difference between the three of clothing, seat, and room in the first chapter above? Therefore, there is no sequence.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c14_21']	先明有所離故不墮，次「有止行故」下具三方軌，三「止行離」下具足三德。	先明有所離故不墮，次「有止行故」下具三方軌，三「止行離」下具足三德。	09a	First, it clarifies that because there is something to be left behind, one does not fall. Next, below because there is the practice of cessation, it is equipped with the three norms. Third, below the practice of cessation and leaving, it is fully endowed with the three virtues.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c18_2']	於中先明具德，次明相生，「餘口」下例者，三業俱有慈悲，誓願亦具止觀，故四行例同，故知還用前品為今行相，若不爾者，非善弘經。	於中先明具德，次明相生，「餘口」下例者，三業俱有慈悲，誓願亦具止觀，故四行例同，故知還用前品為今行相，若不爾者，非善弘經。	09a	In this, it first clarifies the complete virtues, and next clarifies the mutual generation. The example below the other mouth is that the three karmas all have compassion, and the vows are also equipped with cessation and contemplation. Therefore, the four practices are the same. Therefore, it should be known that they still use the previous chapter as the present practice. If it were not so, it would not be skillfully propagating the sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c19_18']	五正釋者，釋「行處近處」中，先三古師，次章安破者，以初家行淺近深，即初兩家。	五正釋者，釋「行處近處」中，先三古師，次章安破者，以初家行淺近深，即初兩家。	09a	As for the fifth correct explanation, in explaining the place of practice and the place of proximity, first there are the three ancient masters, and next Zhizhe refutes them. The first master's practice is shallow and the place is deep, which is the first two masters.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c22_1']	於中次家二釋，初釋因果別，後釋通因果，故破初家及次家初釋云十地有行非獨初心。	於中次家二釋，初釋因果別，後釋通因果，故破初家及次家初釋云十地有行非獨初心。	09a	Among them, the two interpretations of the first family are first interpreted as separate cause and effect, and later interpreted as common cause and effect. Therefore, the first family and the first interpretation of the next family are refuted, saying that the ten grounds have practice, not just the initial mind.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c24_1']	次破後家者，瑤師以七住已上為行，七住已前為近，故引《淨名》等覺極深亦名為近。	次破後家者，瑤師以七住已上為行，七住已前為近，故引《淨名》等覺極深亦名為近。	09a	Next, the latter family is refuted. The Yao teacher takes the seven abodes and above as practice, and the seven abodes and below as near, so he quotes the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, saying that even the extremely profound state of equal enlightenment is also called near.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c24_14']	「若兩行」去總判三家互失。	「若兩行」去總判三家互失。	09a	If both practices and below, in general, judges that the three families mutually lose.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c26_1']	言「兩行」者，行近兩處俱得名行，所以俱淺俱深並皆有過。	言「兩行」者，行近兩處俱得名行，所以俱淺俱深並皆有過。	09a	As for two practices, both the practice and the near are called practice, so both shallow and deep have faults.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c27_1']	言前品者，指〈持品〉中能忍違從，即深行也。	言前品者，指〈持品〉中能忍違從，即深行也。	09a	As for the previous chapter, it refers to being able to endure going against and following in the chapter on upholding the sūtra, which is profound practice.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c28_2']	何關此中言七方便者，權行所行不涉今品。	何關此中言七方便者，權行所行不涉今品。	09a	How is it related to the seven expedient means in this chapter? The practices of provisional practices do not involve this chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0317c28_13']	「然行名」下立理破也。	「然行名」下立理破也。	09a	However, the name of practice and below establish principles to refute.

Each practice includes both aspects, so they are all inclusive of both shallow and profound. They cannot be both profound or both shallow, or alternately profound and shallow.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318a04_4']	然今品文始行正當並淺而永異古師，以通俱深異七方便，淺名雖通其意則別，下去約位義通於深，以深攝淺故也。	然今品文始行正當並淺而永異古師，以通俱深異七方便，淺名雖通其意則別，下去約位義通於深，以深攝淺故也。	09a	However, the text of this chapter begins with the initial practice, which is properly both shallow and eternal, differing from the ancient masters, with both being profound, differing from the seven expedient means. The name shallow is通通, but the meaning is different. The following positions are generally profound, because the profound includes the shallow.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318a05_10']	「又行近」下引義以破，既是〈法師品〉中衣座室三，理無淺深。	「又行近」下引義以破，既是〈法師品〉中衣座室三，理無淺深。	09a	Moreover, practicing and approaching... below cites the meaning to refute. Since it is the three of robe, seat, and room in the Dharma Master Chapter, there is no shallow or profound principle.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318a09_9']	附事者，離十惱亂等事中下文亦觀空等，如引義中寂滅忍與畢竟空豈容深淺？	附事者，離十惱亂等事中下文亦觀空等，如引義中寂滅忍與畢竟空豈容深淺？	09a	As for the attached matters, they are apart from the matters of the ten kinds of vexations and so forth. The lower text also contemplates emptiness and so forth, just like the meaning of the forbearance of quiescent extinction and ultimate emptiness. How could there be deep and shallow?
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318a13_1']	但對事說得忍衣名，約理以說得空座名，故附事必依理，從理必經事，不應圓行事理條然，亦如二諦必真俗相即，各說一邊非無所詣，約行準說。	但對事說得忍衣名，約理以說得空座名，故附事必依理，從理必經事，不應圓行事理條然，亦如二諦必真俗相即，各說一邊非無所詣，約行準說。	09a	But speaking in terms of matters, one obtains the name of the robe of forbearance. Speaking in terms of principles, one obtains the name of the seat of emptiness. Therefore, the attached matters must rely on principles. Following principles must go through matters. One should not make the matters and principles of the perfect teaching separate. It is also like the two truths, which must be the mutual identity of the true and the conventional. Speaking of only one side is not without something to which to go. Speaking in terms of practice, it is the same.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318b10_5']	能住是行，人得理故能行勝行，行即不行，故云「行於不行之行」也。	能住是行，人得理故能行勝行，行即不行，故云「行於不行之行」也。	09a	Abiding is practice, because the person who attains principle is able to practice superior practices. Practice is precisely non-practice, thus it is said practicing the practice of non-practice.

The basis refers to the stage of forbearance. Because one abides in one stage, one possesses the three such as gentleness. The first sentence like myriad things generally cites the previous stage to establish the second practice. The first sentence is a metaphorical explanation. Various practices combines the metaphor. If one attains clarifies the merit of being able to give birth. Within this, it specifically eliminates the three sentences. This is based on principle, and only then can one be gentle and so forth, and be at peace when startled.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318b17_10']	「無量」下德釋功德所由，「地無所生」指前實理，「而生功德」即柔和等。	「無量」下德釋功德所由，「地無所生」指前實理，「而生功德」即柔和等。	09a	Immeasurable and below explain the basis for merit. The earth does not give birth refers to the previous true principle. Yet it gives birth to merit refers to gentleness and so forth.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318b21_9']	言「遍無分別」者，行與不行性相無二，見諸法實名不分別，無不分別名亦不行不分別。	言「遍無分別」者，行與不行性相無二，見諸法實名不分別，無不分別名亦不行不分別。	09a	As for pervasively without discrimination, the nature and characteristics of practice and non-practice are non-dual. Seeing the reality of all dharmas is called non-discrimination, and the absence of non-discrimination is also called neither practicing nor not practicing non-discrimination.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318b22_15']	「三無三」下對處結名，以得實處故，使其行有一三相。	「三無三」下對處結名，以得實處故，使其行有一三相。	09a	Below the three without the three, it concludes the name based on the place, because by attaining the real place, it causes its practice to have the characteristics of one and three.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318b25_6']	四「如此」下與前品義合者，初句總標，「休息」下對前三句，休息即行不行，隨生即不行行，遍無即非行非不行。	四「如此」下與前品義合者，初句總標，「休息」下對前三句，休息即行不行，隨生即不行行，遍無即非行非不行。	09a	Fourth, below thus, it combines the meaning with the previous chapter. The first sentence generally indicates. Below resting, it corresponds to the previous three sentences. Resting is practicing and not practicing. Following arising is not practicing and practicing.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c01_16']	真俗假實通於三教，今意在圓，何但異二乘耶？	真俗假實通於三教，今意在圓，何但異二乘耶？	09a	The provisional and real of true and conventional extends to the three teachings, but the meaning now lies in the perfect. How is it only different from the two vehicles?
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c02_6']	且隨難辨故暫對之。	且隨難辨故暫對之。	09a	For now, it is provisionally distinguished according to difficulty.

The conventional is provisional, and the real is true. Therefore, the Profound Text says:
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c05_7']	「世諦破性，真諦破假」，假破即相空，性破即性空，故真俗不二。	「世諦破性，真諦破假」，假破即相空，性破即性空，故真俗不二。	09a	The conventional truth breaks down natures, and the truth breaks down the provisional. Breaking down the provisional is the emptiness of characteristics, and breaking down natures is the emptiness of natures. Therefore, the true and conventional are not two.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c06_11']	二空俱時，為對所破以分真俗，即不思議之真俗也。	二空俱時，為對所破以分真俗，即不思議之真俗也。	09a	The two emptinesses are simultaneous. In order to distinguish the true and conventional based on what is broken down, it is the inconceivable true and conventional.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c07_15']	通中亦有此之二空，名同義異，俱時不殊須善斟酌。	通中亦有此之二空，名同義異，俱時不殊須善斟酌。	09a	The common teaching also has these two emptinesses. The names are the same but the meanings are different. They are not different in being simultaneous. One must carefully consider this.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c12_9']	若為六忍，即離伏忍中「和」字，餘同五忍。	若為六忍，即離伏忍中「和」字，餘同五忍。	09a	If we divide it into six forbearances, we separate the character gentle from the forbearance of patience, and the rest are the same as the five forbearances.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c13_9']	若更開為四十二忍，但於無生、寂滅二忍中出；	若更開為四十二忍，但於無生、寂滅二忍中出；	09a	If we further divide it into forty-two forbearances, they are all within the two forbearances of non-arising and quiescent extinction;

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c15_18']	若言一地具四十一，則地地四十一忍，亦地地有伏順等。	若言一地具四十一，則地地四十一忍，亦地地有伏順等。	09a	If we say that one stage has forty-one, then each stage has forty-one forbearances, and each stage has the forbearances of patience, compliance, and so forth.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c23_23']	初、二如文。	初、二如文。	09a	The first two are as the text.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c25_10']	三舉別教中，即以二忍判彼四忍，即伏順在地前，故云「生忍」。	三舉別教中，即以二忍判彼四忍，即伏順在地前，故云「生忍」。	09a	Third, in the distinct teaching, using the two forbearances to distinguish the four forbearances of the other, the forbearances of伏順 are in the stage before the grounds, thus it says forbearance of birth.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c26_17']	無生在地上，寂滅在極果，故從初地依法得忍，通名「法忍」。	無生在地上，寂滅在極果，故從初地依法得忍，通名「法忍」。	09a	The forbearance of 無生 is on the grounds, and the forbearance of寂滅 is at the ultimate fruit, thus from the first ground, relying on the Dharma to attain forbearance, it is generally called forbearance of the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0318c27_10']	四今圓中圓位，諸忍俱無淺深。	四今圓中圓位，諸忍俱無淺深。	09a	Fourth, in the perfect and perfect stages, all forbearances are without shallowness or depth.

The reason for not explaining the stage of abiding in forbearance, etc., is that the establishment of the perfect four forbearances is all due to abiding in the stage of forbearance, therefore it is left for now.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0319a09_2']	於生忍中又不消柔和善順者，即不卒心不驚去是柔和等德，既了不卒暴等前則準知，故知四忍並依理者，為顯圓故。	於生忍中又不消柔和善順者，即不卒心不驚去是柔和等德，既了不卒暴等前則準知，故知四忍並依理者，為顯圓故。	09a	Within the patience of birth, if one does not eliminate gentleness and obedience, then one's mind is not abrupt and one does not go away in alarm.

['ZH_T34_1719_09a:0322c26_15']	《經》云「有大」等者，如來見此小乘賢聖已除界內因果，名「與陰戰」，至般若後名「大功勳」，故三毒等且在小中。	《經》云「有大」等者，如來見此小乘賢聖已除界內因果，名「與陰戰」，至般若後名「大功勳」，故三毒等且在小中。	09a	The sutra says there is a great and so on. The Tathagata sees that these Hinayana sages have already eliminated the causes and effects within the realm, called battling with the aggregates.

Next, the sixteen practices say all. According to the explanation below, it starts from the ten faiths and ends with wonderful enlightenment. Therefore, we know that the three delusions are only the coarse three poisons in the desire realm, because the ten faiths completely eliminate the delusions of the three realms. Below, there are still the three of views, thoughts, and so on. Therefore, it says all, because the word all comprehensively includes the three delusions that turn together.

Previously, it has already been clarified that the merit of propagating the sutra after the Buddha's passing is profound. The ancient Buddhas have certified the sutra, and the present Buddha has attained enlightenment. The benefits of propagating it in this land and other directions for 28,000 myriads of koṭis of kalpas cannot be measured. The reason why people obtain wonderful merit is because the Dharma is true. Therefore, at the end of the distribution, it is repeatedly discussed what is being distributed.

Being able to practice these four practices also includes the power of propagating the sutra. The merit of transforming returns to oneself, and the characteristics of the fruition first appear. Therefore, it causes the great being to dream for an instant longer than a billion years, showing that the merit of propagating the teaching in one lifetime surpasses that of many eons.
