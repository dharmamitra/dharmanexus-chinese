['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c06_14']	依彼種上立此性故。	依彼種上立此性故。	Because this nature is established based on those seeds,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c07_5']	即說彼種名異生性障。	即說彼種名異生性障。	those seeds are called the obstacle of the nature of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c07_15']	此即異生之障依主釋。	此即異生之障依主釋。	This is an explanatory compound, with the obstacle belonging to ordinary beings.

['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c12_9']	若分別二障現種為體。	若分別二障現種為體。	If the two obstacles of discrimination are taken as their essence,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c12_18']	如何二愚唯現非種。	如何二愚唯現非種。	why are the two delusions only actual and not seeds?

['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c13_10']	障寬愚狹故不相違。	障寬愚狹故不相違。	Because the obstacles are broader and the delusions are narrower, there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c13_16']	又此異生性。	又此異生性。	Moreover, this nature of ordinary beings,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c14_6']	雖通本隨分別現種。	雖通本隨分別現種。	although it is common to both fundamental and derivative, and is discriminated as actual and seeds,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c14_15']	然由執著云何引發。	然由執著云何引發。	nevertheless, it is caused by attachment and how it is brought forth.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c15_5']	故貪瞋等攝屬二執。	故貪瞋等攝屬二執。	Therefore, greed, anger, and so forth are included in the two attachments.

['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c15_12']	聖位翻凡。	聖位翻凡。	The holy stage is the opposite of the ordinary.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c16_3']	何故初地聖性唯依種立。	何故初地聖性唯依種立。	Why is the holy nature of the first ground only established based on seeds?

['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c16_15']	以現行間斷故非聖性。	以現行間斷故非聖性。	Because the actual functioning is intermittently cut off, it is not the holy nature.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c16_17']	問。	問。	Question:
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c17_9']	若爾地前已有無漏法爾智種。	若爾地前已有無漏法爾智種。	If that is so, then there are already pure innate wisdom seeds on the ground of preparation.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c17_18']	何不於彼立為聖性。	何不於彼立為聖性。	Why are they not established as the holy nature there?
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c18_1']	答。	答。	Answer:
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c18_14']	以凡聖二性同時相違過失故。	以凡聖二性同時相違過失故。	Because the error of the simultaneous mutual contradiction of the two natures of ordinary and holy exists.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c19_3']	雖有種而非聖性。	雖有種而非聖性。	Although there is a type, it is not the nature of the noble ones.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c19_8']	如滅心定。	如滅心定。	Like the concentration that extinguishes the mind.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c19_14']	依種假立微。	依種假立微。	Based on the type, the subtle is provisionally established.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c20_7']	微心時雖有彼性而非滅定。	微心時雖有彼性而非滅定。	Even though there is that nature at the time of the subtle mind, it is not the concentration that extinguishes the mind.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c21_2']	以有心無心義相違故亦同彼。	以有心無心義相違故亦同彼。	Because the meaning of having mind and being without mind are mutually contradictory, it is also the same as that.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c21_17']	又釋地前未有彼無漏種故非聖性。	又釋地前未有彼無漏種故非聖性。	Another explanation is that before the ground, there is no uncontaminated type, so it is not the nature of the noble ones.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c22_7']	法爾種子非所許故。	法爾種子非所許故。	Because the seeds of dharmas are not accepted.

['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c23_1']	既異生性是不相應行攝。	既異生性是不相應行攝。	Since the nature of ordinary beings is included in the non-associated compositional factors,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c23_6']	聖性翻凡。	聖性翻凡。	the noble nature is the opposite of the ordinary.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c23_15']	何不亦立不相應邪。	何不亦立不相應邪。	Why is it also not established as a non-associated compositional factor?

['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c24_2']	依大乘宗。	依大乘宗。	According to the Mahāyāna school,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c24_11']	聖性亦是不相應攝。	聖性亦是不相應攝。	the noble nature is also included in the non-associated compositional factors.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c25_2']	即二十四中非得是也。	即二十四中非得是也。	It is the non-acquisition among the twenty-four.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c25_11']	以宗許此通無漏故。	以宗許此通無漏故。	Because this school accepts that it extends to the uncontaminated,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c26_1']	不同小乘不通無漏。	不同小乘不通無漏。	unlike the Hīnayāna, which does not extend to the uncontaminated.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c26_8']	又釋異生劣故。	又釋異生劣故。	Another explanation is that because the nature of ordinary beings is inferior,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c26_14']	別立不相應。	別立不相應。	it is separately established as a non-associated compositional factor.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c27_1']	聖法力勝故。	聖法力勝故。	Because the power of the noble dharmas is superior,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c27_9']	不別立亦不相違。	不別立亦不相違。	it is not contradictory to not separately establish it.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c27_14']	又唯識云。	又唯識云。	Moreover, the Vijñaptimātratā says:
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c28_4']	雖初地所斷實通二障。	雖初地所斷實通二障。	Although the obstacles that are eliminated in the first stage are actually both obstacles,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c28_15']	而異生性障意取所知說。	而異生性障意取所知說。	the obstacle of the nature of ordinary beings is said to be the obstacle to that which is to be known.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c29_4']	十無明非染污故。	十無明非染污故。	The ten kinds of ignorance are not defiled.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0228c29_13']	無明即是十障品愚。	無明即是十障品愚。	Ignorance is precisely the delusion in the ten categories of obstacles.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a01_3']	上來且約斷煩惱說。	上來且約斷煩惱說。	The above discussion is based on the elimination of the passions.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a01_16']	理實初地亦除惡趣諸業果等。	理實初地亦除惡趣諸業果等。	In reality, the first stage also eliminates the results of actions such as the evil destinies.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a02_10']	是故要說具斷二愚及彼麁重。	是故要說具斷二愚及彼麁重。	Therefore, it is necessary to say that it completely eliminates the two delusions and their coarseness.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a02_17']	一執著我法愚。	一執著我法愚。	The first is the delusion of attachment to self and dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a03_5']	即是異生性障。	即是異生性障。	This is precisely the obstacle of the nature of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a03_12']	二惡趣雜染愚。	二惡趣雜染愚。	The second is the delusion of the defilement of the evil destinies.

['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a05_7']	顯上二愚非唯無明執我法時。	顯上二愚非唯無明執我法時。	It shows that the above two delusions are not only ignorance. When one is attached to self and dharmas,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a06_1']	所有愚及俱起法說為初愚。	所有愚及俱起法說為初愚。	the delusion and the dharmas that arise together are called the first delusion.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a06_13']	愚品類惡趣業果體雖非愚。	愚品類惡趣業果體雖非愚。	The category of delusions, the body of actions and results of the evil destinies, although not delusions,
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a07_7']	愚所發業及所感果總說為愚。	愚所發業及所感果總說為愚。	are generally referred to as delusions because they are produced by delusion and are the results of delusion.
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a07_12']	彼論又說。	彼論又說。	That treatise also says:
['ZH_T85_2755_001:0229a08_4']	利鈍障品俱起以為二愚。	利鈍障品俱起以為二愚。	The two delusions are made up of the categories of sharp and dull obstacles that arise together.
