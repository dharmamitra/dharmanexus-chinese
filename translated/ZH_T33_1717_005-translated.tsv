['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846b26_17']	文中三麁一妙者，且以但麁對獨妙說，餘之三味麁妙相帶，故略未論，下文具列。	文中三麁一妙者，且以但麁對獨妙說，餘之三味麁妙相帶，故略未論，下文具列。	005	In the text, there are three coarse and one wonderful. For now, it is said that only the coarse is opposed to the unique wonderful. The other three flavors are coarse and wonderful, so they are not discussed in detail. The following text lists them in full.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846b27_1']	於中二：	於中二：	005	There are two parts in this:

['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846b29_14']	若觀心十，並皆附在諸文之末，或存或沒不別開章。	若觀心十，並皆附在諸文之末，或存或沒不別開章。	005	If it is the ten of contemplating the mind, they are all attached to the end of various texts, sometimes existing and sometimes disappearing, not opening a separate chapter.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846c02_10']	既其觀心寄在諸文之下，今但約迹本兩門各具十妙，義各攝於心佛眾生。	既其觀心寄在諸文之下，今但約迹本兩門各具十妙，義各攝於心佛眾生。	005	Since contemplating the mind is entrusted to the end of various texts, now it is only about the two gates of trace and origin each having ten wonderful meanings, each meaning includes the mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846c03_1']	今初迹門十妙者，為二：	今初迹門十妙者，為二：	005	Now, the first ten wonderful meanings of the trace gate are divided into two:

['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846c06_8']	釋中為五者，第一中云廣解五章，一一廣起五心者，故今釋名迹十妙中望前七番以成五心，唯少開合，及觀心等並散在諸文故也。	釋中為五者，第一中云廣解五章，一一廣起五心者，故今釋名迹十妙中望前七番以成五心，唯少開合，及觀心等並散在諸文故也。	005	In the commentary, the first part says explaining the five chapters in detail, each giving rise to five minds. This means that in the explanation of the ten wondrous principles of the traces, compared to the previous seven sets, it forms the five minds, only lacking the opening and closing, as well as the contemplation of the mind, which are scattered throughout various texts.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846c08_11']	故今標章起念引證起信生起起定，況諸妙下處處皆然，并觀心起進開合起慧，五心足也。	故今標章起念引證起信生起起定，況諸妙下處處皆然，并觀心起進開合起慧，五心足也。	005	Therefore, now the chapter headings are raised, thoughts are drawn, evidence is cited, faith is aroused, and arising is determined. Moreover, in the various wondrous principles below, everywhere is the same, along with the arising of the contemplation of the mind, the opening and closing of progress, and the wisdom of arising. The five minds are complete.

It is not just simply listing the ten names, but also listing each of the various sections within the chapters, such as the realm fully listing six, and the wisdom listing twenty, etc. The text can be understood by observing it.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0846c14_10']	釋者事，須略述諸科文相大體，攬下觀今，粗亦可見，乃至一一妙中皆先列竟、末後說意，如境妙云「境是所師」，智云「導行」等，尋之可知。	釋者事，須略述諸科文相大體，攬下觀今，粗亦可見，乃至一一妙中皆先列竟、末後說意，如境妙云「境是所師」，智云「導行」等，尋之可知。	005	As for the explanation, it is necessary to briefly discuss the general outline of the various sections. By examining the following, one can roughly see it. Even in each wonderful [aspect], it first lists and then explains the meaning at the end. For example, the wonderful realm says the realm is what is relied upon, and the wonderful wisdom says guiding practice and so on. One can understand it by searching.

['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847a18_12']	言「經又稱」等者，生已復生，生生不已，故云「十二牽連」等也。	言「經又稱」等者，生已復生，生生不已，故云「十二牽連」等也。	005	As for saying the sutra also calls and so on, having been born, one is born again, and birth after birth is unceasing, thus it is said twelve connected links and so on.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847a19_7']	「此十二」下釋名，新新秪是念念續起。	「此十二」下釋名，新新秪是念念續起。	005	These twelve explains the name, new and new only refers to the continuous arising of moment after moment.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847a25_10']	次料簡中云「纓珞中無明緣行生十二，則一百二十支」者，準彼經第四釋十二因緣云，從無明緣行便生十二支，乃至有緣生老死便生十二，既以未來二支合說，則始從無明來至老死有十一番，此十一番但十箇中間，一一皆生一十二支，故十中間有百二十。	次料簡中云「纓珞中無明緣行生十二，則一百二十支」者，準彼經第四釋十二因緣云，從無明緣行便生十二支，乃至有緣生老死便生十二，既以未來二支合說，則始從無明來至老死有十一番，此十一番但十箇中間，一一皆生一十二支，故十中間有百二十。	005	Next, in the analysis it says in the Sutra of the Jeweled Necklace, the twelve branches born from the condition of ignorance and the condition of action have one hundred and twenty branches. According to that sutra's fourth explanation of the twelve links of dependent arising, it says that from the condition of ignorance and the condition of action, twelve links are born, up to the condition of existence and the condition of birth and old age, twelve are born. Since the two future links are combined and explained, starting from ignorance up to old age there are ten times. These ten times, but ten in the middle, each give rise to twelve links, thus in the ten intervals there are one hundred and twenty.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847a26_14']	若依今文乃成一百三十二支，以開生死為二番故。	若依今文乃成一百三十二支，以開生死為二番故。	005	If based on the present text, it becomes 132 links, because birth and death are opened into two parts.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847a28_10']	雖開合不同，大意不別，今雖開生死，結數依經，是故但云「一百二十」。	雖開合不同，大意不別，今雖開生死，結數依經，是故但云「一百二十」。	005	Although the opening and combining are different, the main idea is not different. Although birth and death are opened here, the number of links is based on the sutra, therefore it is only said to be 120.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847b01_7']	「初是癡」等者，既十二支無明為本，一一復具一十二支，當知支支皆具無明乃至老死。	「初是癡」等者，既十二支無明為本，一一復具一十二支，當知支支皆具無明乃至老死。	005	As for the first is delusion and so on, since the twelve links have ignorance as their root, each one also has the twelve links. One should know that each link is fully endowed with ignorance up to old age and death.

['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847b05_4']	如《伽羅那經》說云，夫緣起法，一切皆是有為法故。	如《伽羅那經》說云，夫緣起法，一切皆是有為法故。	005	As the Kālāma Sūtra says: All dharmas of dependent origination are conditioned dharmas.

['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847b10_23']	故有說者云因是緣起、果是緣生，如因果義，事所事、相所相、成所成、續所續、生所生、取所取亦如是，事如因、所事如果，乃至取亦如是論中初但云因果，次開對二因二果。	故有說者云因是緣起、果是緣生，如因果義，事所事、相所相、成所成、續所續、生所生、取所取亦如是，事如因、所事如果，乃至取亦如是論中初但云因果，次開對二因二果。	005	Therefore, some say that causes are dependent origination and effects are conditioned arising, like the meaning of cause and effect. Events, objects, characteristics, the characterized, accomplishments, what is accomplished, continuums, what is continued, births, what is born, and grasping, what is grasped are also like this. Events are like causes and objects are like effects, up to grasping which is also like this. In the treatise, it first only says cause and effect, and then opens up the two causes and two effects.
['ZH_T33_1717_005:0847b11_15']	復有說者，過去是緣起，現在是緣生不云未來。	復有說者，過去是緣起，現在是緣生不云未來。	005	Again, some say that the past is dependent origination and the present is conditioned arising, not mentioning the future.

The different capacities of sentient beings lead to the differences in the Dharma. From the one true principle, the provisional principle is opened. The two principles of the provisional and real have different teachings that can be expounded, so the teachings of the four kinds of distinctions arise.

['ZH_T33_1717_005:0853a17_16']	次文中言「爾前」者，齊初僧祇初皆名爾前，故容有墮，以此菩薩至第三僧祇始離五障方乃不墮，何必第三阿僧祇末始惡道出？	次文中言「爾前」者，齊初僧祇初皆名爾前，故容有墮，以此菩薩至第三僧祇始離五障方乃不墮，何必第三阿僧祇末始惡道出？	005	In the next passage, it says before that. Up to the first asaṃkhyeya kalpa, it is all called before that, and therefore one may still fall. Because this bodhisattva reaches the third asaṃkhyeya kalpa and only then departs from the five hindrances, he does not fall.
