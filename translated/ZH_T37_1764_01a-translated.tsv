['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a06_0', 'ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a07_0']	聖教萬差，要唯有二，謂聲聞藏及菩薩藏，教🔽聲聞法名聲聞藏、教菩薩法名菩薩藏。聲聞	聖教萬差，要唯有二，謂聲聞藏及菩薩藏，教 聲聞法名聲聞藏、教菩薩法名菩薩藏。聲聞	The myriad differences in the teachings can be summarized as two: the Sravaka Canon and the Bodhisattva Canon.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a08_6']	藏中所教有二：	藏中所教有二：	The teachings for sravakas are called the Sravaka Canon, and the teachings for bodhisattvas are called the Bodhisattva Canon. In the Sravaka Canon, there are two types of teachings:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a08_18']	一聲聞聲聞、二緣覺聲聞。	一聲聞聲聞、二緣覺聲聞。	1. Sravaka-sravakas, 2. Pratyekabuddha-sravakas.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a13_5']	聲聞聲聞者，是人先來求聲聞道，常樂觀察四真諦法，成聲聞性，於最後身值佛，為說四真諦法而得悟道，本聲聞性，今復聞聲而得悟道，是故名曰聲聞聲聞，如經中說「求聲聞者為說四諦」。	聲聞聲聞者，是人先來求聲聞道，常樂觀察四真諦法，成聲聞性，於最後身值佛，為說四真諦法而得悟道，本聲聞性，今復聞聲而得悟道，是故名曰聲聞聲聞，如經中說「求聲聞者為說四諦」。	Sravaka-sravakas are those who have been seeking the sravaka path, always delighting in contemplating the four noble truths, and have attained the sravaka nature. In their final life, they encounter the Buddha, who teaches them the four noble truths, and they attain enlightenment. They originally had the sravaka nature, and now they again hear the teachings and attain the path. Therefore, they are called sravaka-sravakas. As it is said in the sutras, For those seeking the sravaka path, the four noble truths are taught.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a17_13']	據此為言，緣覺聲聞者，是人本來求緣覺道，常樂觀察十二緣法，於最後身值佛，為說十二緣法而得悟道，本緣覺性，於最後身聞聲悟道，是故名為緣覺聲聞，如經中說「為求緣覺者說十二緣法」。	據此為言，緣覺聲聞者，是人本來求緣覺道，常樂觀察十二緣法，於最後身值佛，為說十二緣法而得悟道，本緣覺性，於最後身聞聲悟道，是故名為緣覺聲聞，如經中說「為求緣覺者說十二緣法」。	Based on this statement, those who are pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas are people who originally sought the path of pratyekabuddhas and always enjoyed contemplating the twelve links of dependent origination. In their final lifetime, they encountered the Buddha, who taught them the Dharma of the twelve links of dependent origination, and they attained enlightenment. The original nature of pratyekabuddhas, in their final lifetime, awakened to the path upon hearing sounds. Therefore, they are called pratyekabuddha śrāvakas. As it is said in the sūtras, For those seeking pratyekabodhi, I teach the Dharma of the twelve links of dependent origination.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a19_5']	就斯為論，是二雖殊，同求小法，藉教、處等，是故對斯二人所說為聲聞藏。	就斯為論，是二雖殊，同求小法，藉教、處等，是故對斯二人所說為聲聞藏。	Based on this, although these two are different, they are the same in seeking the lesser Dharma, relying on teachings, places, and so forth. Therefore, the teachings spoken for these two people are the śrāvaka canon.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a19_18']	菩薩藏中所教之人亦有二種：	菩薩藏中所教之人亦有二種：	There are also two kinds of people taught in the bodhisattva canon:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a20_5']	一漸、二頓。	一漸、二頓。	1. gradual, and 2. sudden.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a23_7']	言漸入者，是人過去曾習大法，中間學小，後還入大，大從小入，謂之為漸，故經說言「除先修習學小乘者，我今亦令入是法中」，此是漸入。	言漸入者，是人過去曾習大法，中間學小，後還入大，大從小入，謂之為漸，故經說言「除先修習學小乘者，我今亦令入是法中」，此是漸入。	As for gradual entry, this person in the past had already practiced the great Dharma, but in the middle they studied the small, and later they returned to enter the great. The great enters from the small, which is called gradual. Therefore the sutra says, Except for those who have previously cultivated and studied the lesser vehicle, I will now also cause them to enter this Dharma. This is gradual entry.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a27_7']	言頓悟者，有諸眾生久習大乘相應善根，今始見佛則能入大，大不由小，目之為頓，故經說言「或有眾生，世世已來常受我化，始見我身、聞我所說則皆信受，入如來慧」，此是頓悟。	言頓悟者，有諸眾生久習大乘相應善根，今始見佛則能入大，大不由小，目之為頓，故經說言「或有眾生，世世已來常受我化，始見我身、聞我所說則皆信受，入如來慧」，此是頓悟。	As for sudden enlightenment, there are sentient beings who have long cultivated wholesome roots corresponding to the Mahayana. Now, upon first seeing the Buddha, they are able to enter the great. The great does not depend on the small, which is called sudden. Therefore the sutra says, There are sentient beings who, from lifetime to lifetime, have always received my transformation. Upon first seeing my body and hearing what I say, they all believe and accept it, and enter the Tathāgata's wisdom. This is sudden enlightenment.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613a29_11']	漸入菩薩始小終大、頓悟之人一往入深，頓、漸雖殊，以其當時受大處一，是故對斯二人所說為菩薩藏。	漸入菩薩始小終大、頓悟之人一往入深，頓、漸雖殊，以其當時受大處一，是故對斯二人所說為菩薩藏。	The bodhisattva who gradually enters begins with the small and ends with the great. The person who is suddenly enlightened enters the profound all at once. Although sudden and gradual are different, because at that time they equally accept the great, therefore the teachings given to these two people are called the bodhisattva canon.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b01_7']	聖教雖眾，不出此二，故龍樹云：	聖教雖眾，不出此二，故龍樹云：	Although the teachings of the sages are numerous, they do not go beyond these two. Therefore Nāgârjuna said:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b03_10']	「佛滅度後，迦葉、阿難於王舍城結集三藏為聲聞藏，文殊、阿難於鐵圍山集摩訶衍經為菩薩藏。	「佛滅度後，迦葉、阿難於王舍城結集三藏為聲聞藏，文殊、阿難於鐵圍山集摩訶衍經為菩薩藏。	After the Buddha's nirvāṇa, Kāśyapa and Ānanda compiled the Tripiṭaka in Rājagṛha as the Sūtra Piṭaka for the śrāvakas, and Mañjuśrī and Ānanda compiled the Mahāyāna sūtras on Vulture Peak as the Sūtra Piṭaka for the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b04_13']	」《地持》亦云「佛為聲聞菩薩行出苦道，說修多羅。	」《地持》亦云「佛為聲聞菩薩行出苦道，說修多羅。	The Bodhisattvabhūmi-sūtra also says, The Buddha spoke the sūtras for the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas to cultivate the path out of suffering.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b06_5', 'ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b07_14']	」結集經者，集為二藏，以說聲聞所行為聲聞藏、說菩薩所行為菩薩藏。🔽彼論復云「十二部中，唯方廣部是菩薩藏，餘十一部是聲聞藏。	」結集經者，集為二藏，以說聲聞所行為聲聞藏、說菩薩所行為菩薩藏。 彼論復云「十二部中，唯方廣部是菩薩藏，餘十一部是聲聞藏。	Those who compiled the sūtras compiled them into two piṭakas, with the practices for the śrāvakas in the Sūtra Piṭaka for the śrāvakas and the practices for the bodhisattvas in the Sūtra Piṭaka for the bodhisattvas.🔽That treatise also says, Among the twelve divisions, only the vaipulya division is the Sūtra Piṭaka for the bodhisattvas, while the remaining eleven divisions are the Sūtra Piṭaka for the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b08_18']	」此經亦云「唯方廣部菩薩所持，餘十一部二乘所持。	」此經亦云「唯方廣部菩薩所持，餘十一部二乘所持。	This sūtra also says, Only the vaipulya division is upheld by the bodhisattvas, while the remaining eleven divisions are upheld by the two vehicles.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b10_6']	」菩薩所持猶菩薩藏，二乘所持猶聲聞藏，故知聖說無出此二。	」菩薩所持猶菩薩藏，二乘所持猶聲聞藏，故知聖說無出此二。	What the bodhisattvas uphold is like the Bodhisattva Canon, what the two vehicles uphold is like the Śrāvaka Canon. Therefore, we know that the sage's teachings do not go beyond these two.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b11_11']	此二亦名大乘、小乘，半、滿教等，名雖改變，其義不殊。	此二亦名大乘、小乘，半、滿教等，名雖改變，其義不殊。	These two are also called the Great Vehicle and the Small Vehicle, the Gradual Teachings and the Sudden Teachings, etc. Although the names change, their meanings are not different.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b13_9']	今此經者，二藏之中菩薩藏收，漸教眾生長養法門，故下文言「先教半字，後教滿字」。	今此經者，二藏之中菩薩藏收，漸教眾生長養法門，故下文言「先教半字，後教滿字」。	This sūtra, among the two canons, is included in the Bodhisattva Canon. It is a teaching for gradually guiding sentient beings to cultivate the Dharma. Therefore, the text below says, First teach the half-syllable teachings, later teach the full-syllable teachings.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b13_16']	已知教之分齊。	已知教之分齊。	We have already understood the scope of the teachings.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b13_21']	次釋其名。	次釋其名。	Next, we explain the name.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b14_15']	今言大涅槃者，乃是標經別部名也。	今言大涅槃者，乃是標經別部名也。	Now, the term Great Nirvāṇa is the specific title of this sūtra.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b17_6']	經名不同，乃有多種，或有當法、或復就人、或時隨事、或從喻況、或就人法、或從法喻、或隨事法，其例非一。	經名不同，乃有多種，或有當法、或復就人、或時隨事、或從喻況、或就人法、或從法喻、或隨事法，其例非一。	The names of sūtras are not the same and there are many types. Some accord with the Dharma, some are based on people, some follow events, some are from metaphors, some are about people and Dharma, some are from Dharma and metaphors, some follow events and Dharma, and their examples are not one.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b18_9']	今此經者從法為名，法謂諸佛大涅槃果，故始舉之。	今此經者從法為名，法謂諸佛大涅槃果，故始舉之。	Now, this sutra takes its name from the Dharma. The Dharma refers to the great nirvāṇa fruit of all buddhas, and thus it is mentioned at the beginning.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b19_7']	此名不足，若依梵本，名為摩訶般涅槃那。	此名不足，若依梵本，名為摩訶般涅槃那。	This name is insufficient. If based on the Sanskrit text, it is called Mahāparinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b19_17']	摩訶名大，歎勝之詞。	摩訶名大，歎勝之詞。	Mahā means great, which is an expression of praise.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b20_13']	涅槃有三，謂聲聞、緣覺及佛所得。	涅槃有三，謂聲聞、緣覺及佛所得。	There are three kinds of nirvāṇa, namely that attained by śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b21_14']	簡別前二不加，是故言大，體實絕待，寄對顯之。	簡別前二不加，是故言大，體實絕待，寄對顯之。	Distinguishing the former two, it is not added, and therefore it is called great. In reality, it transcends all comparisons, but it is used to illustrate it.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b21_19']	大義有六：	大義有六：	There are six meanings of great:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b22_15']	一常故名大，故下文言「大名為常」；	一常故名大，故下文言「大名為常」；	First, it is called great because it is eternal. Therefore, the text below says, Great means eternal.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b24_19']	二勝故名大，如世勝人名為大人，故下文言「是人若能安住正法，名人中勝」，勝故名大，涅槃如是；	二勝故名大，如世勝人名為大人，故下文言「是人若能安住正法，名人中勝」，勝故名大，涅槃如是；	Second, it is called great because it is superior. Like the superior people in the world are called great people. Therefore, the text below says, If such a person can abide in the true Dharma, he is the most superior among people. Because of its superiority, it is called great. Nirvāṇa is like this.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b26_2']	三廣故名大，故下文言「大名廣博」，體窮法界，名性廣博；	三廣故名大，故下文言「大名廣博」，體窮法界，名性廣博；	Third, it is called great because it is vast. Therefore, the text below says, Great means vast. Its essence pervades the Dharma realm, and is called vast by nature.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613b28_1']	四多故名大，故下文言「譬如大藏，多諸珍異」，涅槃如是，多有種種妙法珍寶，故名為大；	四多故名大，故下文言「譬如大藏，多諸珍異」，涅槃如是，多有種種妙法珍寶，故名為大；	Fourth, it is called great because of abundance. Therefore, the text below says, It is like a great treasury with many rare treasures. Nirvana is like this, with many kinds of wonderful Dharma treasures, so it is called great;
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c01_9']	五高故名大，故下文言「譬如大山，人不能上，故名大山」，涅槃如是，凡夫二乘乃至十住不能到故，名之為大；	五高故名大，故下文言「譬如大山，人不能上，故名大山」，涅槃如是，凡夫二乘乃至十住不能到故，名之為大；	Fifth, it is called great because of loftiness. Therefore, the text below says, It is like a great mountain that people cannot climb, so it is called a great mountain. Nirvana is like this, because ordinary beings, two vehicles, and even the ten abodes cannot reach it, it is called great;
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c03_9']	六深故名大，如海淵深，名為大海，故下文言「大者名為不可思議，淵深難測，名不可思」。	六深故名大，如海淵深，名為大海，故下文言「大者名為不可思議，淵深難測，名不可思」。	Sixth, it is called great because of profundity. Like the ocean's depth is called the great ocean. Therefore, the text below says, Great means inconceivable, profound and difficult to fathom, called inconceivable.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c03_19', 'ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c04_18']	大體不同，略有三種：🔽一者體大，謂性淨涅槃，體窮真性，義充法界；	大體不同，略有三種： 一者體大，謂性淨涅槃，體窮真性，義充法界；	The essence of greatness is not the same, and in brief there are three kinds:🔽First, the essence of greatness, referring to the pure nirvana, whose essence reaches the ultimate true nature, and whose meaning fills the Dharma realm;
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c05_18']	二者相大，謂方便涅槃，過無不盡，德無不備；	二者相大，謂方便涅槃，過無不盡，德無不備；	Second, the characteristic of greatness, referring to the skillful means nirvana, whose faults are completely exhausted and whose virtues are completely possessed;
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c06_18']	三者用大，謂應化涅槃，妙用曠周，巧化無盡。	三者用大，謂應化涅槃，妙用曠周，巧化無盡。	Third is the greatness of function, referring to the wondrous function that pervades and transforms without end in response and transformation nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c08_6']	故下文言「大般涅槃能建大義」，義猶用也，具斯三義，是故言大。	故下文言「大般涅槃能建大義」，義猶用也，具斯三義，是故言大。	Therefore, the text below says, The great nirvāṇa can establish great meaning. Meaning is still function. Endowed with these three meanings, therefore it is called great.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c08_16']	所言般者，此翻名入。	所言般者，此翻名入。	As for the word prati [in nirvāṇa], it is translated as to enter.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c09_1']	入義有三：	入義有三：	There are three meanings of to enter:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c10_1']	一就實以論，息妄歸真，從因趣果，名之為入；	一就實以論，息妄歸真，從因趣果，名之為入；	First, from the perspective of reality, it refers to ceasing delusion and returning to truth, from cause to fruition, which is called to enter;
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c11_1']	二據化辨入，示滅有因，現亡身智，趣入無為；	二據化辨入，示滅有因，現亡身智，趣入無為；	Second, from the perspective of transformation, it refers to demonstrating the cause of cessation, manifesting the extinction of body and wisdom, and entering into the unconditioned;
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c11_15']	三就真應相對說入，息化歸真。	三就真應相對說入，息化歸真。	Third, from the perspective of the true and the provisional, it refers to ceasing transformation and returning to the true.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c12_4']	今此所論，備具三義。	今此所論，備具三義。	The present discussion is endowed with all three meanings.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c13_3']	言涅槃者，有人釋言「非梵、非漢，直是佛語。	言涅槃者，有人釋言「非梵、非漢，直是佛語。	As for the word nirvāṇa, some people explain it as neither Indian nor Chinese, it is simply the Buddha's word.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c13_19']	」若論佛語，一切皆是，豈獨涅槃？	」若論佛語，一切皆是，豈獨涅槃？	If discussing the Buddha's words, all of them are. How can nirvāṇa alone be so?
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c16_5']	故下文言「種種異論、文章、呪術，皆是佛說」，雖是佛說，不離方言，若離方言，佛則無說，云何而言非梵、非漢？	故下文言「種種異論、文章、呪術，皆是佛說」，雖是佛說，不離方言，若離方言，佛則無說，云何而言非梵、非漢？	Therefore, the text below says, The various different theories, writings, and spells are all spoken by the Buddha. Although they are spoken by the Buddha, they are not apart from local languages. If apart from local languages, the Buddha has no speaking. How can it be said to be neither Sanskrit nor Chinese?
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c17_17']	有人復言「是天竺語，名總萬德，此方更無一名能翻，故存梵本，名曰涅槃。	有人復言「是天竺語，名總萬德，此方更無一名能翻，故存梵本，名曰涅槃。	Some people also say, This is the language of India, which is called 'comprehending myriad virtues.' There is no single name in this land that can translate it, so the Sanskrit original is preserved and called 'nirvāṇa.'
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c20_19']	」涅槃之體實備萬德，涅槃一名非盡萬德，若使涅槃名含萬德，是則宣說萬德之時，不應隨德更立名字，欲說萬德，更立別名，明知非總。	」涅槃之體實備萬德，涅槃一名非盡萬德，若使涅槃名含萬德，是則宣說萬德之時，不應隨德更立名字，欲說萬德，更立別名，明知非總。	The essence of nirvāṇa truly encompasses myriad virtues, but the single name 'nirvāṇa' does not exhaust myriad virtues. If the name 'nirvāṇa' were to contain myriad virtues, then when proclaiming myriad virtues, one should not follow the virtues and establish different names. If one wishes to proclaim myriad virtues and establish separate names, it is clear that it is not comprehensive.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c22_6']	若言此方無名能翻，此義不然，如下文中如來隨類普告眾生：	若言此方無名能翻，此義不然，如下文中如來隨類普告眾生：	If it is said that this land has no name that can translate it, this meaning is not so. As explained below in the text, the Tathāgata universally announces to sentient beings according to their kind:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c22_16']	「今日如來將欲涅槃。	「今日如來將欲涅槃。	Today the Tathāgata is about to enter nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c23_6']	」隨音異告，云何叵翻？	」隨音異告，云何叵翻？	Why is it difficult to translate?
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c23_16']	今正相翻，名之為滅；	今正相翻，名之為滅；	Now it is being translated correctly, and it is called extinction;
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c26_6']	隨義傍翻，名別多種，或云不生、或云不滅、或稱不燃、或言不織、或曰寂靜、或名無為、或云無相，如是非一。	隨義傍翻，名別多種，或云不生、或云不滅、或稱不燃、或言不織、或曰寂靜、或名無為、或云無相，如是非一。	Following the meaning, it is translated as many different things, such as non-arising, non-cessation, non-burning, non-weaving, tranquility, unconditioned, or signless. There are not just one or two such [names].
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c26_15']	云何得知是滅非總？	云何得知是滅非總？	How can one know that it is extinction and not a general [term]?
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c27_4']	今此且以四義驗之：	今此且以四義驗之：	Now, this is examined with four meanings:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0613c29_13']	一就昔以求，如來昔於餘契經中每常宣說生死因果盡無之處以為涅槃，今日涅槃，名不異昔，何忽是總？	一就昔以求，如來昔於餘契經中每常宣說生死因果盡無之處以為涅槃，今日涅槃，名不異昔，何忽是總？	First, seeking from the past, the Tathāgata always proclaimed in other sūtras that the place where the causes and effects of birth and death are exhausted is nirvāṇa. Today's nirvāṇa is no different from the past, so how could it suddenly be general?
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0614a01_13']	二據終以驗，如來今於婆羅樹間，大音普告云：	二據終以驗，如來今於婆羅樹間，大音普告云：	Second, verifying from the end, the Tathāgata now proclaims with a great voice between the two śāla trees:
['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0614a01_18']	「今涅槃。	「今涅槃。	Now entering nirvāṇa.

['ZH_T37_1764_01a:0614a04_4']	若使涅槃名總萬德，是則宣唱萬德示人，眾生應喜，何故悲泣，詣佛請住？	若使涅槃名總萬德，是則宣唱萬德示人，眾生應喜，何故悲泣，詣佛請住？	If nirvāṇa is said to be the totality of myriad virtues, then proclaiming the myriad virtues to others would cause sentient beings to rejoice. Why would they weep and go to the Buddha to request him to remain?
