['ZH_T29_1563_008:0809c23_6']	辯差別品第三之四雖離所相別有生等，與所相法俱時而起，而無一法一時即生即住即異即滅過失，如體不同用有別故。	辯差別品第三之四雖離所相別有生等，與所相法俱時而起，而無一法一時即生即住即異即滅過失，如體不同用有別故。	008	Although arising, etc. exist separately from the characterized, arising simultaneously with the characterized dharmas, there is no fault of a single dharma being produced, abiding, changing, and ceasing at one time, because the substance is not the same and the functions are distinct.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0809c25_8']	執所相外無別生等，一一剎那有四相者，如斯過失不可救療，一法一時功能差別理不成故。	執所相外無別生等，一一剎那有四相者，如斯過失不可救療，一法一時功能差別理不成故。	008	If one grasps that apart from the characterized there are no separate arising, etc., and that each moment has four characteristics, such faults cannot be cured, because the distinctions in function of a single dharma at one time are not logically possible.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0809c27_2']	許所相外有別生等，無斯過失，相體不同、助緣差別、時分功能理有異故。	許所相外有別生等，無斯過失，相體不同、助緣差別、時分功能理有異故。	008	If one allows that apart from the characterized there are separate arising, etc., there is no such fault, because the substance of the characteristics is not the same, the assisting conditions are distinct, and the time periods and functions are logically different.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0809c28_12']	然有為法分位不同，略有三種，謂引果用，未得、正得、已滅別故。	然有為法分位不同，略有三種，謂引果用，未得、正得、已滅別故。	008	However, conditioned dharmas have different states, which are roughly of three kinds: because of the difference in the function of attracting effects, which has not yet been obtained, is being obtained, and has already ceased.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0809c29_8']	此諸有為復有二種，謂有作用及唯有體。	此諸有為復有二種，謂有作用及唯有體。	008	These conditioned dharmas are also of two kinds: those with activity and those that merely have substance.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a01_17']	前是現在，後是去來，此復一一各有二種，謂彼功能有勝有劣。	前是現在，後是去來，此復一一各有二種，謂彼功能有勝有劣。	008	The former is present, and the latter is past and future. Each of these has two kinds, namely, superior and inferior power.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a02_17']	諸有為法，若能為因引攝自果，名為作用；	諸有為法，若能為因引攝自果，名為作用；	008	If conditioned dharmas can act as causes to attract their own effects, this is called function.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a03_11', 'ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a06_4']	若能為緣攝助異類，是謂功能。🔽若有別法於未獲得引果用時，由遇未得，正得已滅，引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是名生相。	若能為緣攝助異類，是謂功能。 若有別法於未獲得引果用時，由遇未得，正得已滅，引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是名生相。	008	If they can act as conditions to assist other kinds, this is called power.🔽If there is a separate dharma that, when it has not yet obtained the function of attracting effects, is assisted by external conditions that have not yet been obtained, are being obtained, or have already ceased, and gives rise to the power of internal conditions that assist in accomplishing its own affairs, this is called the characteristic of birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a08_11']	或復有法，於正獲得引果用時，由遇未得，正得已滅，引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能。	或復有法，於正獲得引果用時，由遇未得，正得已滅，引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能。	008	Or, there may be a dharma that, when it is in the process of obtaining the function of attracting effects, is assisted by external conditions that have not yet been obtained, are being obtained, or have already ceased, and gives rise to the power of internal conditions that assist in accomplishing its own affairs.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a12_12']	是餘三相，於正生位生為內緣起所生法，至已生位此所生法名為已起，於正滅位住為內緣安所住法，令引自果至已滅位，此所住法名於自果已能引發即正滅位。	是餘三相，於正生位生為內緣起所生法，至已生位此所生法名為已起，於正滅位住為內緣安所住法，令引自果至已滅位，此所住法名於自果已能引發即正滅位。	008	The other three characteristics, in the state of being born, are the internal conditions that give rise to dharmas that are born. When they reach the state of being born, these dharmas that are born are called arisen. In the state of perishing, abiding is the internal condition that stabilizes the dharma that abides, causing it to attract its own effect. When it reaches the state of having perished, this dharma that abides is called able to attract its own effect, which is precisely the state of perishing.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a13_16']	滅為內緣壞所滅法至已滅位，此所滅法名為已壞。	滅為內緣壞所滅法至已滅位，此所滅法名為已壞。	008	Perishing is the internal condition that destroys the dharma that is perishing. When it reaches the state of having perished, this dharma that is perishing is called perished.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a14_7']	異相亦爾，如應當知。	異相亦爾，如應當知。	008	The characteristic of difference is also like this, as should be known according to the circumstances.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a14_12']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	008	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a15_7']	因要待處、世時位伴，能與果故。	因要待處、世時位伴，能與果故。	008	Because causes must rely on place, world, time, state, and companions in order to give effects.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a16_16']	生已生時起用差別，謂或有因待處與果，如雨要待雲處方生。	生已生時起用差別，謂或有因待處與果，如雨要待雲處方生。	008	After arising, the distinctions in function arise. This means that there are causes that rely on place to give effects. For example, rain must rely on the place of clouds in order to arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a17_16']	要贍部洲處金剛座，方證無上正等菩提。	要贍部洲處金剛座，方證無上正等菩提。	008	One must rely on the vajra seat of Jambudvīpa in order to realize supreme perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a19_6']	或復有因待世與果，如異熟因順解脫分，要在過去方能與果。	或復有因待世與果，如異熟因順解脫分，要在過去方能與果。	008	Or there are causes that depend on the world and its results, such as the cause of retribution and the cause of the stage of liberation, which can only give results when they are in the past.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a20_13']	或復有因待時與果，如輪王業要劫增時方能獲得轉輪王位。	或復有因待時與果，如輪王業要劫增時方能獲得轉輪王位。	008	Or there are causes that depend on time and give results, such as the karma of a wheel-turning king, which can only obtain the position of a wheel-turning king when the eon is increasing.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a22_1']	或復有因待位與果，如諸種子至變異位方能生芽。	或復有因待位與果，如諸種子至變異位方能生芽。	008	Or there are causes that depend on state and give results, such as seeds, which can only produce sprouts when they reach a changed state.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a23_18']	初無漏心及光明等體雖先有，而要未來正生位中能有所作，或復有因待伴與果。	初無漏心及光明等體雖先有，而要未來正生位中能有所作，或復有因待伴與果。	008	Although the substance of the first pure mind and light, etc. existed previously, they can only function in the future when they are in the state of arising. Or there are causes that depend on companions and give results.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a24_17']	如四大種心心所等，要與伴俱能有所作。	如四大種心心所等，要與伴俱能有所作。	008	Such as the four great elements, mind, mental factors, etc., which can only function when they are accompanied by companions.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a27_5']	由斯差別緣起正理，四相起用分位不同，謂正生時生相起用，至已生位住異滅三同於一時各起別用。	由斯差別緣起正理，四相起用分位不同，謂正生時生相起用，至已生位住異滅三同於一時各起別用。	008	Due to these distinctions, the correct principle of dependent origination, the different stages of the arising of the four characteristics, are as follows: When just arising, the characteristic of birth performs its function. When it reaches the stage of having arisen, abiding, changing, and ceasing, the three perform their respective functions at the same time.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810a28_12']	如是四相用時既別，故無一法一時即生即住即異即滅過失。	如是四相用時既別，故無一法一時即生即住即異即滅過失。	008	Since the four characteristics function at different times, there is no error in saying that a single dharma is produced, endures, ages, and is destroyed at one time.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b03_8']	又正滅時，此所相法由餘住相為勝因故暫時安住能引自果，即於爾時由餘異相為勝因故令其衰損，即於爾時由餘滅相為勝因故令其滅壞，故三一時無相違失。	又正滅時，此所相法由餘住相為勝因故暫時安住能引自果，即於爾時由餘異相為勝因故令其衰損，即於爾時由餘滅相為勝因故令其滅壞，故三一時無相違失。	008	Moreover, when it is about to be destroyed, the dharma that is characterized by these characteristics temporarily endures because the characteristic of endurance is its dominant condition. It is able to attract its own effect. At that very moment, because the characteristic of aging is its dominant condition, it causes it to decay. At that very moment, because the characteristic of destruction is its dominant condition, it causes it to be destroyed. Therefore, there is no error in saying that the three characteristics exist at one time.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b05_7']	時所相法為名安住、為名衰異、為名壞滅，由能相力，所相一時所望不同，具有三義。	時所相法為名安住、為名衰異、為名壞滅，由能相力，所相一時所望不同，具有三義。	008	When the dharma that is characterized by these characteristics is called enduring, it is called decaying and changing, and it is called being destroyed. Because of the power of the characteristics, the characterized dharma is said to have three meanings at one time, depending on the point of view.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b05_12']	如何異相？	如何異相？	008	What is the characteristic of aging?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b07_4']	即於住時衰損能引自果作用損彼作用，令後果生劣於前因，是異相力。	即於住時衰損能引自果作用損彼作用，令後果生劣於前因，是異相力。	008	It is the decay of the dharma that is characterized by endurance. It is able to attract its own effect. Its power damages the power of the characteristic of endurance, causing the subsequent effect to be produced in a way that is inferior to the prior cause. This is the power of the characteristic of aging.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b07_14']	後果漸劣，由因有異。	後果漸劣，由因有異。	008	The subsequent effect gradually becomes inferior because the cause has changed.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b08_16']	此果復由俱起異相為緣衰損，能令後果更劣於前。	此果復由俱起異相為緣衰損，能令後果更劣於前。	008	This result is also due to the arising together of different characteristics as conditions, which can cause the subsequent result to be even worse than the previous.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b10_5']	如是一切有為相續剎那剎那令後後異，故前前念有異義成。	如是一切有為相續剎那剎那令後後異，故前前念有異義成。	008	In this way, the continuity of all conditioned phenomena in each moment causes the subsequent to be different, so the meaning of difference in each preceding moment is established.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b10_15']	此義既成，應為比量。	此義既成，應為比量。	008	Since this meaning is established, it should be used as an inference.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b11_13']	謂見最後有差別故，前諸剎那定有差別。	謂見最後有差別故，前諸剎那定有差別。	008	That is to say, because the last is seen to have differences, the preceding moments must have differences.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b12_12']	若爾，相續漸增長時異相應無，不見果故。	若爾，相續漸增長時異相應無，不見果故。	008	If that is so, when the continuity gradually increases, the differences should not exist, because the result is not seen.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b13_15']	無斯過失，住相爾時由外緣助勢力增強，摧伏異故。	無斯過失，住相爾時由外緣助勢力增強，摧伏異故。	008	There is no such fault, because at that time the characteristic of abiding is assisted by external conditions, whose power is greatly increased, and subdues the differences.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b14_16']	若生在未來生所生法，未來一切法何不頓生？	若生在未來生所生法，未來一切法何不頓生？	008	If arising exists in the future, and the arising causes the dharmas to be produced, why do not all future dharmas arise at once?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b15_6']	彼能生因各常合故。	彼能生因各常合故。	008	Because the causes that can produce them are always combined.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b15_11']	此先已辯。	此先已辯。	008	This has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b15_16']	先何所辯？	先何所辯？	008	What was explained earlier?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b18_8']	謂有別法於未獲得引果用時，由遇未得，正得已滅，引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是名生相。	謂有別法於未獲得引果用時，由遇未得，正得已滅，引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是名生相。	008	That is, there is a separate dharma that, when the function of attracting a result has not yet been obtained, is grasped by encountering what has not yet been obtained, is correctly obtained, and has ceased. When the function of attracting a result is obtained, external conditions assist in grasping. With regard to accomplishing its own affairs, it generates the power of internal conditions assisting in grasping. This is called the characteristic of birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b19_7']	又作是說，因要待處、世時位伴方與果故。	又作是說，因要待處、世時位伴方與果故。	008	Moreover, there is a theory that says: Because causes must depend on place, world, time, and companions in order to give results.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b19_16']	即依此義說如是言。	即依此義說如是言。	008	Based on this meaning, the following statement is made.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b20_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	008	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b21_13']	生能生所生，　　非離因緣合。	生能生所生，　　非離因緣合。	008	Birth can give rise to what is born, but not apart from the combination of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b22_2']	論曰：	論曰：	008	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b23_10']	非離所餘因緣和合，唯生相力能生所生，故諸未來非皆頓起。	非離所餘因緣和合，唯生相力能生所生，故諸未來非皆頓起。	008	Apart from the combination of the remaining causes and conditions, the power of the characteristic of birth alone cannot give rise to what is born, and therefore not all future [dharmas] arise suddenly.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b25_7']	生相雖作俱起近因，能生所生諸有為法而必應待前自類因及餘外緣和合攝助。	生相雖作俱起近因，能生所生諸有為法而必應待前自類因及餘外緣和合攝助。	008	Although the characteristic of birth acts as a proximate cause that arises together, it can give rise to the conditioned dharmas that are born, but it must necessarily depend on the causes of its own kind that precede it, and on the combination of assistance from other external conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b26_6']	如種地等差別因緣，助芽等生令生芽等。	如種地等差別因緣，助芽等生令生芽等。	008	Just as the various causes and conditions such as seeds and earth assist in the arising of sprouts and cause the arising of sprouts, etc.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b27_6']	若爾，我等唯見因緣有生功能，無別生相。	若爾，我等唯見因緣有生功能，無別生相。	008	If this is so, we only see that causes and conditions have the power to produce, and there is no separate characteristic of production.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b28_4']	有因緣合諸法即生，無即不生，何勞生相？	有因緣合諸法即生，無即不生，何勞生相？	008	When causes and conditions come together, dharmas are produced. Without them, they are not produced. What need is there for a characteristic of production?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b28_13']	故應唯有因緣力生。	故應唯有因緣力生。	008	Therefore, there should only be production by the power of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810b29_12']	此責不然，唯許眾緣諸法生者，此責同故。	此責不然，唯許眾緣諸法生者，此責同故。	008	This criticism is unreasonable, because the same criticism applies to the view that only the coming together of causes and conditions produces dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c01_15']	謂若唯許未來諸法因緣和合而得生者，此責亦同。	謂若唯許未來諸法因緣和合而得生者，此責亦同。	008	That is to say, if one only allows that future dharmas are produced by the coming together of causes and conditions, this criticism is the same.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c02_12']	未來諸法因緣無別者，何不頓皆生？	未來諸法因緣無別者，何不頓皆生？	008	If there is no difference between the causes and conditions of future dharmas, why do they not all arise suddenly?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c03_11']	又因緣中隨𨵗一種，具所餘故果亦應生。	又因緣中隨𨵗一種，具所餘故果亦應生。	008	Moreover, since the remaining ones are complete in the causes and conditions, the effect should also be produced.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c04_10']	且如眼根先業所引，雖離大種而亦應生。	且如眼根先業所引，雖離大種而亦應生。	008	For example, the eye faculty is drawn by past karma. Even if it is separated from the great elements, it should still be produced.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c05_8']	或應但由大種功力，不由先業眼根得生。	或應但由大種功力，不由先業眼根得生。	008	Or it should be said that the eye faculty is produced only by the power of the great elements, not by past karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c06_17']	或諸眼根隨業所引能生大種，無不合時，於一生時餘亦應起。	或諸眼根隨業所引能生大種，無不合時，於一生時餘亦應起。	008	Or the great elements drawn by past karma that can produce the eye faculty are never out of step. When one is produced, the others should also arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c08_18']	或應大種於眼無能，不見離前眼大種獨生故，但應因前眼後眼得生，許大種能生應成無用。	或應大種於眼無能，不見離前眼大種獨生故，但應因前眼後眼得生，許大種能生應成無用。	008	Or else, the primary elements have no power with regard to the eye, because the eye is not seen apart from the primary elements of the former eye, and the later eye is produced only on the basis of the former eye. If you admit that the primary elements have the power to produce, then this power is useless.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c09_17']	又如種子水土等緣，隨𨵗一時芽必不起。	又如種子水土等緣，隨𨵗一時芽必不起。	008	Again, just as seeds, water, soil, etc., are not all present at the same time, and the sprout does not necessarily arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c10_12']	故知種等功力極成於眼等生。	故知種等功力極成於眼等生。	008	Therefore we know that the power of seeds, etc., is fully realized in the production of the eye, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c11_7']	地等大種能生功力，非所現見。	地等大種能生功力，非所現見。	008	The power of the primary elements of earth, etc., to produce is not directly perceived.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c12_5']	既不現見大種功力，應不為因生於眼等。	既不現見大種功力，應不為因生於眼等。	008	Since the power of the primary elements is not directly perceived, they should not be causes producing the eye, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c13_13']	又汝所執有業種子相續轉變，誰為障礙，不能頓生一切業果？	又汝所執有業種子相續轉變，誰為障礙，不能頓生一切業果？	008	Again, who is the obstacle to the transformation of the continuity of the seeds of karma that you maintain, so that it cannot suddenly produce all the results of karma?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c14_15']	若由緣助業種方能生，應但緣能生，何勞業種？	若由緣助業種方能生，應但緣能生，何勞業種？	008	If the seeds of karma are able to produce only when assisted by conditions, then the conditions alone should be able to produce. Why bother with the seeds of karma?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c15_13']	以眾緣助業果乃生，眾緣若無果不生故。	以眾緣助業果乃生，眾緣若無果不生故。	008	Because the results of karma are produced only when assisted by many conditions. If the conditions are absent, the results are not produced.
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c16_14']	既賴緣助而業種非無，雖藉眾緣寧撥無生相。	既賴緣助而業種非無，雖藉眾緣寧撥無生相。	008	Since the seeds of karma are not without existence when they rely on the assistance of conditions, even though they rely on many conditions, how can you deny the existence of the characteristics of production?
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c17_9']	又於眼等諸識生中，處處經言：	又於眼等諸識生中，處處經言：	008	Moreover, in the arising of the various consciousnesses such as the eye consciousness, the scriptures say:
['ZH_T29_1563_008:0810c18_3']	雖有眼色，若離作意眼識不生。	雖有眼色，若離作意眼識不生。	008	Even though there is an eye and form, if the attention is absent, the eye consciousness does not arise.
