['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a10_12']	2釋教化品之餘「時諸大眾」下，眾既聞法深廣，其得法利亦復稱是，故經云云，謂以類則六道八部之別，以益則無生正位之殊，得道賒促、歷生多少、入位有異，疏簡惡道得忍可知。	2釋教化品之餘「時諸大眾」下，眾既聞法深廣，其得法利亦復稱是，故經云云，謂以類則六道八部之別，以益則無生正位之殊，得道賒促、歷生多少、入位有異，疏簡惡道得忍可知。	004	At that time, the great assembly - having heard the profound and vast Dharma, the benefits they attained were also praised accordingly. The sutra says thus and so. In terms of categories, there are the distinctions of the six paths and eight groups. In terms of benefits, there are the differences in the stage of non-arising. The length of time in attaining the Way, the number of lifetimes experienced, and the differences in entering the stage are all explained in the commentary. The avoidance of evil paths and the attainment of forbearance can be understood.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a12_8']	無生法忍正當諸教證真之位，大約與正位無別，如《普賢觀》明無生入正位是也。	無生法忍正當諸教證真之位，大約與正位無別，如《普賢觀》明無生入正位是也。	004	The forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas is precisely the stage of realizing the truth in various teachings. Generally speaking, it is no different from the stage of truth. It is like the Samādhi of Universal Worthy which clarifies entering the stage of truth through non-arising.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a13_12']	據今所明，復似不同，一以二空言之、二約真似為說。	據今所明，復似不同，一以二空言之、二約真似為說。	004	According to what is explained here, it seems to be different again. First, it is discussed in terms of the two kinds of emptiness, and second, it is explained in terms of true and semblance.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a14_12']	則正位通真似，無生唯局真，未知的何所據？	則正位通真似，無生唯局真，未知的何所據？	004	Then, the stage of truth includes both true and semblance, while non-arising is only in the true stage. It is not known on what basis this is determined.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a15_10']	然以證聖人性句正之，是亦義當證位。	然以證聖人性句正之，是亦義當證位。	004	However, using the phrase attaining the nature of sagehood to verify it, this is also equivalent to the stage of realization.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a16_14']	疏雖未始定判，而證入位次務在所得，豈必為定論邪？	疏雖未始定判，而證入位次務在所得，豈必為定論邪？	004	Although it has not been definitively determined, the sequence of entry into realization is based on what is attained. How could it necessarily be a definitive discussion?
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a17_8']	二空之說亦隨文用與爾云云。	二空之說亦隨文用與爾云云。	004	The teachings on the two emptinesses are also used according to the text.

['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a19_2']	或約損生，如今文例釋云云。	或約損生，如今文例釋云云。	004	Or based on reducing lives, as explained in the current text.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a20_5']	「善男子」下，如來述成，合於教理，蓋其本迹深遠故也。	「善男子」下，如來述成，合於教理，蓋其本迹深遠故也。	004	Good sons and below, the Tathāgata's approval, combining with the teachings and principles, is because its basis and traces are profound and distant.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a22_6']	於是先告實發迹，據疏釋實合在得道果上，言其本所住位與佛相隣，驗知今迹去佛不遠。	於是先告實發迹，據疏釋實合在得道果上，言其本所住位與佛相隣，驗知今迹去佛不遠。	004	Here, he first announces the true disclosure of the traces, according to the commentary, the truth should be above the attainment of the fruit of the path, saying that the original abode and the Buddha are adjacent, verifying that the current traces are not far from the Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a23_1']	十地法雲能師子吼，豈虛授哉？	十地法雲能師子吼，豈虛授哉？	004	The Dharma cloud of the tenth ground is able to roar like a lion, how could it be given in vain?

['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a25_7']	唯佛與佛，「與」或作「以」，如經律亦有作與義用者。	唯佛與佛，「與」或作「以」，如經律亦有作與義用者。	004	Only the Buddhas and the Buddhas, with may be written as by, in the sutras and vinaya there are also those that use the meaning of with.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a25_20']	以《法華》正之，終不若與。	以《法華》正之，終不若與。	004	Using the Lotus Sutra to rectify it, it is still not as good as with.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a26_24']	不為菩薩者，「為」恐作「唯」，發問之言，亦從初云爾。	不為菩薩者，「為」恐作「唯」，發問之言，亦從初云爾。	004	Not for the Bodhisattvas, for is feared to be written as only, the words of asking about the meaning, also follow the beginning to say so.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306a29_8']	依義廣釋中，言一切諸佛是中生等者，中應作二釋，謂其中之中，則一切諸佛雖有生滅化三，皆不離其中。	依義廣釋中，言一切諸佛是中生等者，中應作二釋，謂其中之中，則一切諸佛雖有生滅化三，皆不離其中。	004	In the extensive explanation based on the meaning, it says all Buddhas are born in the middle and so forth. The middle should be explained in two ways, namely the middle of the middle, then although all Buddhas have the three of birth, cessation, and transformation, they are all not apart from the middle.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b01_14']	若作中道之中，則雖復生滅，無非中道，亦猶佛常好中云。	若作中道之中，則雖復生滅，無非中道，亦猶佛常好中云。	004	If it is taken as the middle of the middle way, then even though there is birth and cessation, it is all the middle way, it is also like the Buddha always being fond of the middle.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b02_1']	就明空義為三：	就明空義為三：	004	In clarifying the meaning of emptiness, it is divided into three:
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b02_16']	一約化相空，則曰無生無滅無化。	一約化相空，則曰無生無滅無化。	004	First, in terms of the emptiness of the transformed characteristics, it says no birth, no cessation, no transformation.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b03_16']	謂以蕩立言之，則法身本無相，為物故有形。	謂以蕩立言之，則法身本無相，為物故有形。	004	If we use the method of negation to establish the teaching, then the Dharma body is originally without characteristics, but for the sake of beings it has form.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b04_15']	所以王宮生雙林滅者，以生滅化眾生立也。	所以王宮生雙林滅者，以生滅化眾生立也。	004	The reason for being born in the royal palace and passing away in the twin trees is to use birth and death to transform sentient beings and establish the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b05_7']	又曰無生滅化者，蕩也。	又曰無生滅化者，蕩也。	004	It is also said that the transformation without birth and death is negation.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b06_1']	即蕩而立、即立而蕩，中道在焉。	即蕩而立、即立而蕩，中道在焉。	004	Negation is establishment, and establishment is negation. The middle way is in this.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b06_21']	「無自無他」下，疏謂逐難重釋，其說似迂。	「無自無他」下，疏謂逐難重釋，其說似迂。	004	Without self and without other - the commentary says it is a further explanation of the difficult points, and the explanation seems roundabout.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b07_8']	今只作躡上覆疏釋之。	今只作躡上覆疏釋之。	004	Now I will only follow the previous commentary to explain.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b08_8']	謂凡言化必有自他，有自他則有一二故覆。	謂凡言化必有自他，有自他則有一二故覆。	004	It means that all transformations must have self and other. If there is self and other, then there is one and two, so it is covered.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b10_4']	疏云無自無他、無一無二，第合作無非化非不化，則化不化雙泯，安有於相乎？	疏云無自無他、無一無二，第合作無非化非不化，則化不化雙泯，安有於相乎？	004	The commentary says without self and without other, without one and without two. It should be said neither transformation nor not transformation. Then transformation and non-transformation are both negated. How can there be characteristics?
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b10_10']	則無相而已。	則無相而已。	004	It is simply without characteristics.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b11_5']	而曰非無無相者，則又反上重立。	而曰非無無相者，則又反上重立。	004	But it is said not without the absence of characteristics. This is again a double negation.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b12_2']	既無無相，而無相亦無，何有於去來？	既無無相，而無相亦無，何有於去來？	004	Since there is no absence of characteristics, and the absence of characteristics is also absent, how can there be coming and going?
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b13_4']	亦應云非無去來，所謂不來相而來、無見相而見。	亦應云非無去來，所謂不來相而來、無見相而見。	004	It should also be said that there is no absence of past and future, namely, coming without the appearance of coming, seeing without the appearance of seeing.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b13_20']	非無來去，亡其迹耳，故曰如虛空。	非無來去，亡其迹耳，故曰如虛空。	004	It is not without coming and going, but only the traces are lost, therefore it is said to be like space.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b15_5']	此下凡有三如虛空句，並結終歸於空，則畢竟空而已矣。	此下凡有三如虛空句，並結終歸於空，則畢竟空而已矣。	004	Below this, there are three phrases about space, all concluding in returning to emptiness, which is ultimately just emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b15_18']	故今約三節釋義，其理明矣。	故今約三節釋義，其理明矣。	004	Therefore, now explaining the meaning in three sections, the principle is clear.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b16_12']	二約眾生人法明空，如文云云。	二約眾生人法明空，如文云云。	004	Second, using the person and dharmas of sentient beings to clarify emptiness, as the text says.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b18_4']	謂一切眾生無生滅等，總明人法空，故生滅等三亦悉叵得，故皆空也。	謂一切眾生無生滅等，總明人法空，故生滅等三亦悉叵得，故皆空也。	004	It means that all sentient beings are without birth and cessation, etc., generally clarifying the emptiness of person and dharmas, therefore birth, cessation, etc., the three are also all unobtainable, therefore all are empty.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b19_15']	非不因果者，例上蕩立可知，如疏引《大品》等具釋顯然，今不別解。	非不因果者，例上蕩立可知，如疏引《大品》等具釋顯然，今不別解。	004	Not without cause and effect can be understood by analogy with the above negation and establishment, as the commentary quotes the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, etc., the explanation is clear, and now it is not separately explained.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b20_2']	「煩惱」下，別明二空。	「煩惱」下，別明二空。	004	Afflictions and below specifically clarify the two kinds of emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b20_18']	此我人等本屬見使，故以煩惱該之。	此我人等本屬見使，故以煩惱該之。	004	This self, person, etc., originally belong to the view-afflictions, therefore afflictions encompass them.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b22_14']	若論我所，即假名所託本當實法，今以「者」字當之，約能計者說，當是人法二執。	若論我所，即假名所託本當實法，今以「者」字當之，約能計者說，當是人法二執。	004	If we discuss the self, it is the basis of the provisional name, which originally corresponds to real dharmas. Now the word 者 corresponds to it, and is spoken in terms of the one who conceives, which is the two attachments to person and dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b23_5']	「一切法集」下，以實法顯空。	「一切法集」下，以實法顯空。	004	The collection of all dharmas below shows emptiness through real dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b24_4']	實本非假，為成空義，故以名等三假言之。	實本非假，為成空義，故以名等三假言之。	004	Real dharmas are originally not provisional, but in order to establish the meaning of emptiness, they are spoken of in terms of the three provisional names such as name.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b26_1']	法境界空者，正言人法所顯之空，此空無相故不可轉，此空不顛倒故不順幻化。	法境界空者，正言人法所顯之空，此空無相故不可轉，此空不顛倒故不順幻化。	004	The emptiness of the realm of dharmas means the emptiness revealed by person and dharmas. This emptiness is signless, so it cannot be turned. This emptiness is non-inverted, so it does not accord with illusory transformations.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b27_9']	《圓覺》所謂知幻即離離幻即覺，故不隨諸幻，是亦不順之義也。	《圓覺》所謂知幻即離離幻即覺，故不隨諸幻，是亦不順之義也。	004	As the Perfect Enlightenment Sutra says, Knowing the illusion is to be free from it, and being free from the illusion is enlightenment. Therefore, it does not follow the various illusions. This is also the meaning of not according.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b28_14']	無三寶者，凡諸名相本對治之說，苟無所對則名亦不立。	無三寶者，凡諸名相本對治之說，苟無所對則名亦不立。	004	There are no Three Jewels - all names and characteristics are originally teachings for counteracting [afflictions]. If there is nothing to be countered, then the names also do not stand.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306b29_4']	今顯空義，是故云爾。	今顯空義，是故云爾。	004	Now, in revealing the meaning of emptiness, this is why it is said.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c01_16']	又曰無聖人六道者，謂所空境界既無世出世之異，聖名凡號復從誰立？	又曰無聖人六道者，謂所空境界既無世出世之異，聖名凡號復從誰立？	004	It also says the six paths without sages means that since the realm of emptiness is already without the distinction between worldly and transcendent, from whom can the names of sages and ordinary beings be established?
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c02_8']	所謂絕凡聖之假名是也。	所謂絕凡聖之假名是也。	004	In other words, it is the cessation of the provisional names of sages and ordinary beings.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c03_5']	「三般若無知」下，克就般若當體明空。	「三般若無知」下，克就般若當體明空。	004	The three prajñas are without knowledge clarifies prajña from its own essence.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c04_13']	謂聖凡人法皆空，則唯有般若，而般若亦空，故曰般若無知等。	謂聖凡人法皆空，則唯有般若，而般若亦空，故曰般若無知等。	004	It means that since both sages and ordinary beings are empty, there is only prajña, and even prajña is empty, thus it says prajña is without knowledge and so forth.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c06_11']	謂般若者，以智為名、以空為體，以無知無見為相，所謂知止於其所不知，其言至矣。	謂般若者，以智為名、以空為體，以無知無見為相，所謂知止於其所不知，其言至矣。	004	Prajña is named after wisdom and has emptiness as its essence. It takes non-knowledge and non-seeing as its characteristic. It is said that knowledge ends where it does not know. Its words are most profound.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c07_11']	肇師為之作《般若無知論》焉，故其論云云。	肇師為之作《般若無知論》焉，故其論云云。	004	Master Sengzhao wrote the Treatise on Prajña's Non-knowledge. Therefore, the treatise says...
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c08_2']	而經言不行者，心路絕也。	而經言不行者，心路絕也。	004	But the sutra says not practicing because the path of the mind is cut off.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c10_5']	不緣不因者，不同諸法因緣所成也，直即空而已，故不受一切法，不受亦不受始得為今不受也。	不緣不因者，不同諸法因緣所成也，直即空而已，故不受一切法，不受亦不受始得為今不受也。	004	Not relying on conditions means not being formed by causes and conditions like all dharmas. It is simply emptiness, therefore it does not accept any dharmas. Not accepting also means not accepting even non-acceptance, which is the true non-acceptance now.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c11_9']	不得一切照相者，能照既亡、所照亦寂，直如行道相爾。	不得一切照相者，能照既亡、所照亦寂，直如行道相爾。	004	Not attaining any characteristics of illumination means that when the ability to illuminate is gone, the objects illuminated are also quiescent. It is simply like the characteristics of practicing the Way.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c13_5']	行猶行深般若之行，此其所以為行道相，亦如經空相而已矣，故曰法相如是等。	行猶行深般若之行，此其所以為行道相，亦如經空相而已矣，故曰法相如是等。	004	Practice means practicing the practice of profound prajñā. This is why it is called the characteristics of practicing the Way. It is also like the sūtra's characteristics of emptiness. Therefore, it says the characteristics of dharmas are like this, etc.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c14_7', 'ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c15_7']	總結上說法相，如於虛空，無非般若，故曰如如。🔽不可以有心得，故無可立，以一切法悉皆如故；	總結上說法相，如於虛空，無非般若，故曰如如。 不可以有心得，故無可立，以一切法悉皆如故；	004	It concludes the above explanation of the characteristics of dharmas, which are like empty space, and are all prajñā. Therefore, it says suchness.🔽Because it cannot be attained by the mind of existence, there is nothing to establish, because all dharmas are thus;
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c16_8']	不可以無心得，故無可遣，以一切法悉皆真故。	不可以無心得，故無可遣，以一切法悉皆真故。	004	Because it cannot be attained by the mind of non-existence, there is nothing to eliminate, because all dharmas are real.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c19_6']	是則般若功德，非眾生心行所及，故不可以眾生五陰假實中行，與夫境界智解皆所莫及故也唯順於空契無相然乃可行爾。	是則般若功德，非眾生心行所及，故不可以眾生五陰假實中行，與夫境界智解皆所莫及故也唯順於空契無相然乃可行爾。	004	This is the merit of prajñā, which is beyond the reach of the mental activities of sentient beings. Therefore, it cannot be reached by the practices of the five aggregates of sentient beings, whether real or provisional, nor by the objects, wisdom, and understanding. It can only be practiced by conforming to emptiness and being in accord with the signless.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c20_8']	故知般若其為不可思議，言語斷心路絕者是矣。	故知般若其為不可思議，言語斷心路絕者是矣。	004	Therefore, we know that prajñā is inconceivable, that speech is cut off, and that the path of the mind is severed.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c22_3']	惟其不可思議，故菩薩於守行之，是為一切行藏，即前所謂三十忍等是也。	惟其不可思議，故菩薩於守行之，是為一切行藏，即前所謂三十忍等是也。	004	Because it is inconceivable, bodhisattvas guard and practice it. This is the treasury of all practices, which are the so-called thirty forbearances and so forth mentioned above.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c24_4']	一切如來於中住化，是為一切佛藏，即上品寂光，極智所照之境，故皆不可言言而識識也。	一切如來於中住化，是為一切佛藏，即上品寂光，極智所照之境，故皆不可言言而識識也。	004	All tathāgatas abide and transform within it. This is the treasury of all buddhas, which is the supreme quiescent light, the realm illuminated by the ultimate wisdom. Therefore, they are all beyond verbal expression and conceptual understanding.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c24_16']	「善男子」下，述贊功德。	「善男子」下，述贊功德。	004	Good sons and below is the praise of the merit.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c25_13']	既不可思議亦不可度量，則王之所說勝矣。	既不可思議亦不可度量，則王之所說勝矣。	004	Since it is inconceivable and immeasurable, the king's explanation is superior.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c26_11']	只合云於王所說如海一滴，其文曉然。	只合云於王所說如海一滴，其文曉然。	004	It should only be said that it is like a drop in the ocean of what the king has said, the meaning is clear.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c27_11']	而經云如王所說，義似反覆，故使從容釋之。	而經云如王所說，義似反覆，故使從容釋之。	004	But the sutra says as the king has said, which seems to contradict itself, so it is explained with circumlocution.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0306c28_9']	至於問答，顯王說為勝，以其有本故也。	至於問答，顯王說為勝，以其有本故也。	004	As for the questions and answers, it is shown that the king's explanation is superior because it has a basis.

The text divides the true and conventional according to what is illuminated, but it is not saying that the true that can illuminate should also be what is transformed.🔽If we take the true that can illuminate and compare it to the conventional that is transformed, then the true and conventional are both true;

Therefore, it is said that prajñā is without characteristics, etc.

['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309b10_4']	故曰若取文字不行空者，反斥非顯是也。	故曰若取文字不行空者，反斥非顯是也。	004	Therefore, it is said that if one grasps at the written words and does not practice emptiness, it is a rebuke of what is not and a manifestation of what is.

['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309b14_2']	言如如者，意與前後別，當是如於所如之文字，以修諸佛智母，而能生於當果，故云智母。	言如如者，意與前後別，當是如於所如之文字，以修諸佛智母，而能生於當果，故云智母。	004	As for the meaning of suchness, it is different from the previous and following [passages]. It should be the suchness of the written words as they are, using them to cultivate the mother of the buddhas' wisdom, and thus being able to give rise to the future fruit, therefore called the mother of wisdom.

['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309b18_2']	「若三乘般若」下，行性性也。	「若三乘般若」下，行性性也。	004	If the prajñā of the three vehicles and below is the nature of practices.

['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309b20_9']	又曰一切眾生以此為覺性者，以通證別也。	又曰一切眾生以此為覺性者，以通證別也。	004	It is also said that all sentient beings take this as the nature of enlightenment, which is to verify the general through the specific.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309b21_14']	但前明理性故曰根本，此從行說故曰覺性，大體無別也。	但前明理性故曰根本，此從行說故曰覺性，大體無別也。	004	But because the previous clarification was about the principle of reality, it is called the fundamental, while this is spoken from the perspective of practice, so it is called the nature of enlightenment. The great essence is no different.

This is called being without acceptance and without written words.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309b27_18']	無文字者非無文字，文字性離為離文字，止觀所謂達文非文非文非不文，尚何文字之有，故曰離文字為非文字。	無文字者非無文字，文字性離為離文字，止觀所謂達文非文非文非不文，尚何文字之有，故曰離文字為非文字。	004	Being without written words does not mean the absence of written words. The nature of written words is detached, which is detaching from written words. Zhiguan (Mohe Zhiguan) says, Understanding that words are not words, not words, and not not words. How can there be any written words? Therefore, it is said that detaching from written words is not written words.

The text says it this way, but it should say, All dharmas are originally neither one nor two, and the gate of contemplation is immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309c09_1']	抑又以觀從諦本非一二，以諦從觀乃有無量。	抑又以觀從諦本非一二，以諦從觀乃有無量。	004	Moreover, in terms of contemplation following the truth, it is originally neither one nor two, but in terms of truth following contemplation, there are innumerable [aspects].

This means that the bodhisattva does not see the characteristic of sentient beings, and does not see any dharma or two dharmas that can be obtained.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0309c18_15']	若菩薩見眾生相、見有一法二法而可得者，即不見今第一義諦之一二也，故曰一二者第一義諦也。	若菩薩見眾生相、見有一法二法而可得者，即不見今第一義諦之一二也，故曰一二者第一義諦也。	004	If bodhisattvas see sentient beings and see that there are one or two dharmas that can be attained, then they do not see the one and two of the ultimate truth now, therefore it is said that one and two are the ultimate truth.

This is why the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas realize this principle, so it is called the inconceivable meaning, the true nature liberation manifests in accordance with the nature, not as something separate.

The text does not have the words for the main one, but it refers to Ratnasaṃbhava as the main one of the transformation bodies, and the main one is the original one, so the question says Mahāvairocana as the original one, and so on.

Although the words are the same, they are different from that. Therefore, the answer says that the Brahma Net Sutra explains the traces and origin, which means the origin within the traces, not the long-lasting origin, which is different from this sutra.
['ZH_T33_1706_004:0312a11_18']	約體用以言，則法身為本、應化為迹，故曰本迹雖殊不思義一也。	約體用以言，則法身為本、應化為迹，故曰本迹雖殊不思義一也。	004	If it is explained in terms of essence and function, then the Dharma body is the origin and the responsive transformation is the traces, so it is said that although the traces and origin are different, the inconceivable meaning is the same.

However, they have not yet fulfilled the first incalculable eon, and although they will enter the stage of acceptance, they have not yet entered it. They also constantly study the Dharma of patience and subdue the path of patience, but they have not practiced it for a long time. Therefore, they cannot be called those who have determined their status.
