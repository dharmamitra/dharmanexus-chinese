He taught the Bodhisattvas to cultivate the water essence and enter samadhi. Observing the water nature within the body to be unobtainable, starting from nasal mucus and saliva, thus exhausting bodily fluids, essence, blood, and excrement, the swirling water nature within the body is the same as the floating jeweled banners and various fragrant seas outside the world, without any distinction.

When I was a monk, peacefully in meditation in the room, my disciple peeked through the window and looked into the room, only seeing pure water filling the house, with nothing else to be seen. The ignorant child took a piece of tile and pebble and threw it into the water, stirring up the water and making a sound, then left looking back. After I emerged from meditation, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my heart, like when Shariputra encountered the ghost that causes harm. I thought to myself:
['ZH_T19_0945_005:0127c07_1']	『今我已得阿羅漢道久離病緣，云何今日忽生心痛，將無退失？	『今我已得阿羅漢道久離病緣，云何今日忽生心痛，將無退失？	005	'Now I have attained the path of arhatship and have long been free from the conditions of illness. Why did I suddenly experience heart pain today? Could it be that I have regressed?'

Later, when he entered concentration, he saw the water and tiles and pebbles as before. He opened the door and removed them. When I later emerged from concentration, my body was as it was before. I encountered countless Buddhas in this way, up to the Tathāgata Mountain-Sea-Sovereign-Power-Freedom. Only then was I able to transcend my body and merge with the nature of true emptiness, which is non-dual and without distinction from the fragrant seas of the ten directions. Now I have attained the name of youthfulness in the Tathāgata and am included in the assembly of bodhisattvas.

All movements are non-dual, equal and without distinction. At that time, I clearly realized that the nature of these various movements comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. Sentient beings in the ten directions, with inverted views, are all one false [perception]. Thus, up to the three thousand great one thousand [worlds], within a single world, all sentient beings are like a hundred mosquitoes and gadflies buzzing in a single vessel, drumming up a frenzied commotion within the span of an inch.

Moreover, in my own mind, I manifested a great perfect mirror, from which ten kinds of subtle and wonderful jeweled lights radiated out, flowing and permeating the ten directions, reaching the ends of empty space. The banners and kings of all lands came and entered within the mirror, penetrating into my body. My body was the same as empty space, without obstruction. My body was able to skillfully enter the minute lands, widely performing buddha-works and attaining great accord. This great spiritual power came from my discerning observation that the four elements have no basis, and that deluded thoughts arise and cease. Empty space is non-dual, and the buddha-lands are originally the same. Within this sameness, I attained the illumination of non-arising and the acceptance of non-birth.

When Dīpaṃkara Buddha appeared in the world, I was able to accomplish the unsurpassed, wondrous, perfect samādhi of the mind of consciousness.
