['ZH_T16_0656_009:0080a09_12']	今聞如來說甚深法諸賢聖律所入之門，其有聞知了此法者，亦不見著亦不見脫，於空無法而無所損，不見諸法有所從來有所從去。	今聞如來說甚深法諸賢聖律所入之門，其有聞知了此法者，亦不見著亦不見脫，於空無法而無所損，不見諸法有所從來有所從去。	Now, hearing the Tathāgata speak of the profound Dharma and the gateway to entering the sages' and worthies' precepts, if there are those who hear and understand this Dharma, they will neither see attachment nor see liberation. In emptiness and non-existence, there is nothing to lose, and one does not see the dharmas coming from anywhere or going anywhere.
['ZH_T16_0656_009:0080a11_5']	若善男子、善女人，深觀此法無所從來無所從去，爾乃明達名為解脫。	若善男子、善女人，深觀此法無所從來無所從去，爾乃明達名為解脫。	If good men and good women deeply contemplate this Dharma as coming from nowhere and going nowhere, then they will be clearly enlightened and be called liberated.
['ZH_T16_0656_009:0080a14_15']	一切諸法各各別異，其所言見悉各離散無有合偶，復於諸法不生想念而有所成，亦復不念有解脫者，所觀諸法亦不有內亦不有外，亦無有遠亦無有近。	一切諸法各各別異，其所言見悉各離散無有合偶，復於諸法不生想念而有所成，亦復不念有解脫者，所觀諸法亦不有內亦不有外，亦無有遠亦無有近。	All dharmas are each different, and what is said and seen is all scattered and separate, without any combination. Moreover, one does not give rise to thoughts or attachments to dharmas, and one also does not think of there being liberation. The observed dharmas are neither internal nor external, and there is neither distance nor proximity.
['ZH_T16_0656_009:0080a17_7']	得慧菩薩深了本無，其知是者去貢高心不生憍慢，是為善男子、善女人於諸善法而得解脫，便得住於無生滅地。	得慧菩薩深了本無，其知是者去貢高心不生憍慢，是為善男子、善女人於諸善法而得解脫，便得住於無生滅地。	Bodhisattvas who have attained wisdom deeply understand that they are originally non-existent. Those who know this abandon the mind of arrogance and do not give rise to pride. This is how good men and good women attain liberation in the wholesome dharmas and are able to abide in the stage of non-arising and non-ceasing.
['ZH_T16_0656_009:0080a19_14']	其所住者不見有住，復於諸法住無所住，亦於諸法見無所見，是謂善男子、善女人正其性行不念非邪。	其所住者不見有住，復於諸法住無所住，亦於諸法見無所見，是謂善男子、善女人正其性行不念非邪。	Those who abide do not see abiding, and moreover abide in the dharmas without abiding in anything. Also, with regard to the dharmas, they see without seeing anything. This is called the good men and good women who rectify their nature and conduct and do not think of what is false.
['ZH_T16_0656_009:0080a21_4']	其作正見者，便於內性觀了色相亦無有色，亦不見色而有色也。	其作正見者，便於內性觀了色相亦無有色，亦不見色而有色也。	Those who cultivate right views will then observe the characteristics of form within their own nature, and there will be no form. They will also not see form as being form.

This is called the good sons and good women attaining liberation in all dharmas.

Where there is acceptance of the bodhisattva, there is no arising or ceasing. The mind of the bodhisattva is equal to the Way, without duality or variety.
['ZH_T16_0656_009:0080b04_14']	道心適等無若干者，於一切人必有平等無二之心，是謂菩薩故名曰等而無差別。	道心適等無若干者，於一切人必有平等無二之心，是謂菩薩故名曰等而無差別。	When the mind of the Way is equal and without variety, it must have an equal and non-dual mind towards all people. This is called the bodhisattva, and therefore it is called equal without distinction.

All their dust and defilements were extinguished, and they attained the purity of the Dharma eye.
