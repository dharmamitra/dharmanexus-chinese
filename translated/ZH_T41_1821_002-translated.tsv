['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a03_17']	各有勢力相逼之時。	各有勢力相逼之時。	Each has its own power. When they approach each other,
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a04_11']	互相拒遏不得觸著故不相觸。	互相拒遏不得觸著故不相觸。	They mutually resist and obstruct each other, and cannot touch each other, so they do not touch.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a04_16']	故正理云。	故正理云。	Therefore the correct principle says:
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a05_7']	雖於中間有少空隙。	雖於中間有少空隙。	Although there is a small gap in the middle,

['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a09_11']	所以然者。	所以然者。	The reason for this is:
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a10_2']	香體微妙勢力復強。	香體微妙勢力復強。	The substance of smells is subtle and their power is strong.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a10_7']	所以稍遠。	所以稍遠。	Therefore they are slightly farther away.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a10_16']	味體次麁力勢次劣。	味體次麁力勢次劣。	The substance of taste is next coarser, and the power of the substance of touch is next weaker.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a11_5']	觸體最麁其力最弱。	觸體最麁其力最弱。	The substance of touch is the coarsest, and its power is the weakest.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a11_14']	故最近者名為所觸。	故最近者名為所觸。	Therefore, the closest one is called the tangible object.

['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a12_10']	若謂所觸亦能觸者。	若謂所觸亦能觸者。	If it is said that the tangible object can also be the tangible agent,
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a13_1']	應許身根亦是所觸。	應許身根亦是所觸。	then the body faculty should also be the tangible object.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a13_11']	則境．有境便應雜亂。	則境．有境便應雜亂。	Then the object and the agent would be mixed up and confused.

['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a17_2']	非眼瞼等同得至名。	非眼瞼等同得至名。	It is not that the eyelids and so on all attain the same name of close.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a17_11']	即令一切至無差別。	即令一切至無差別。	It does not cause all to be equally close without distinction.
['ZH_T41_1821_002:0052a18_10']	瞼籌藥醫於彼眼根漸隣近中品類別故。	瞼籌藥醫於彼眼根漸隣近中品類別故。	Because the eyelids, counting rods, medicine, and doctor have distinctions within the category of gradual closeness to that eye faculty.
