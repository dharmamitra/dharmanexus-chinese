['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a12_1']	佛於經中說諦有四，一苦、二集、三滅、四道。	佛於經中說諦有四，一苦、二集、三滅、四道。	029	The Buddha has explained in the sutras that there are four truths, namely suffering, origination, cessation, and the path.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a13_17']	於此論中亦先已說，謂有為法除諸聖道，為果性邊皆名苦諦，為因性邊皆名集諦。	於此論中亦先已說，謂有為法除諸聖道，為果性邊皆名苦諦，為因性邊皆名集諦。	029	In this treatise, they have also been explained before, namely conditioned dharmas except for the noble path, which are all called the truth of suffering on the side of being results, and are all called the truth of origination on the side of being causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a15_15']	物雖無異，數分無失，依彼建立現觀位中諸忍智等行相別故，如四正斷出離尋等。	物雖無異，數分無失，依彼建立現觀位中諸忍智等行相別故，如四正斷出離尋等。	029	Although the substance is not different, it is not a mistake to divide it into categories. Based on them, the aspects of patience and knowledge, etc., in the stage of direct realization are established, just like the four right efforts, the investigations of deliverance, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a17_13']	擇滅無為名為滅諦，學無學法皆名道諦，因前果後理數必然，由此定應列諦名處。	擇滅無為名為滅諦，學無學法皆名道諦，因前果後理數必然，由此定應列諦名處。	029	Cessation as a result of discrimination is called the truth of cessation, and the dharmas of learners and post-learners are called the truth of the path. The order of cause and effect is a matter of course. Therefore, the order of the truths must be established.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a18_12']	苦居集後，道在滅前，何故此中果前因後？	苦居集後，道在滅前，何故此中果前因後？	029	Suffering is placed after accumulation, and the path is placed before cessation. Why is the fruit placed before the cause here?
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a19_2']	隨現觀位次第而說。	隨現觀位次第而說。	029	It is explained according to the order of the stages of insight.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a20_2']	謂隨行者現觀位中，前觀前說、後觀後說。	謂隨行者現觀位中，前觀前說、後觀後說。	029	That is to say, in the stages of insight of the practitioner, what is observed first is explained first, and what is observed later is explained later.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a20_16']	然或有法說次隨生，如念住等。	然或有法說次隨生，如念住等。	029	However, there are dharmas whose order is explained according to their arising, such as the foundations of mindfulness.

['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a23_1']	何緣加行必如是觀？	何緣加行必如是觀？	029	Why is it necessary to observe in this way in the stage of added effort?
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a24_18']	謂若有法最為逼惱，修加行位理應先觀，次求彼因，次求彼脫，後應求彼解脫方便。	謂若有法最為逼惱，修加行位理應先觀，次求彼因，次求彼脫，後應求彼解脫方便。	029	That is to say, if there is a dharma that is the most oppressive, in the stage of cultivating added effort, one should first observe it, next seek its causes, next seek its liberation, and finally one should seek the expedient means for liberation.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a26_7']	譬如良醫先觀病者所患病狀，次尋其因，次思病愈，後求良藥。	譬如良醫先觀病者所患病狀，次尋其因，次思病愈，後求良藥。	029	It is like a good doctor who first examines the symptoms of a patient's illness, then seeks its causes, next thinks of the illness's cure, and finally seeks good medicine.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a26_12']	故契經言：	故契經言：	029	Therefore a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914a28_10']	夫醫王者，謂具四德能拔毒箭，一善知病狀、二善知病因、三善知病愈、四善知良藥。	夫醫王者，謂具四德能拔毒箭，一善知病狀、二善知病因、三善知病愈、四善知良藥。	029	The king of doctors, endowed with four virtues, is able to pull out poisonous arrows: first, he well knows the symptoms of illness; second, he well knows the causes of illness; third, he well knows the cure for illness; fourth, he well knows good medicine.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b01_17']	如來亦爾，為大醫王，如實了知苦集滅道，故加行位依此次觀，現觀位中觀次亦爾，由加行力所引發故。	如來亦爾，為大醫王，如實了知苦集滅道，故加行位依此次觀，現觀位中觀次亦爾，由加行力所引發故。	029	The Tathāgata is also like this. As the great king of doctors, he truly understands suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Therefore, in the stage of added effort, he observes in this sequence. In the stage of direct realization, the sequence of observation is also like this, because it is attracted by the power of added effort.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b02_16']	如縱心誦先所誦文，故列聖諦名隨現觀。	如縱心誦先所誦文，故列聖諦名隨現觀。	029	It is like reciting in sequence what one has previously recited. Therefore, the names of the noble truths are listed in the order of direct realization.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b03_9']	次第現等覺，故立現觀名。	次第現等覺，故立現觀名。	029	Because they are directly realized in sequence, they are called direct realizations.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b03_19']	正覺所緣，故唯無漏。	正覺所緣，故唯無漏。	029	Because they are the objects directly realized, they are only pure.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b04_8']	此覺真淨，故得正名。	此覺真淨，故得正名。	029	This realization is truly pure, and thus it is called right.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b04_17']	此聖諦名為目何義？	此聖諦名為目何義？	029	What do the names of these noble truths refer to?
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b05_7']	聖者諦故，得聖諦名。	聖者諦故，得聖諦名。	029	Because they are truths for the noble ones, they are called noble truths.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b06_15']	謂唯聖者於此四諦，能以聖行聖智實觀，異生不然，故名聖諦。	謂唯聖者於此四諦，能以聖行聖智實觀，異生不然，故名聖諦。	029	That is to say, only the noble ones, by means of the noble path and noble cognition, are able to truly contemplate these four truths. Ordinary beings are not, and therefore they are called the noble truths.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b08_3']	唯受一分是苦自體，所餘並非，如何可言諸有漏行皆是苦諦？	唯受一分是苦自體，所餘並非，如何可言諸有漏行皆是苦諦？	029	Only a part of feeling is the substance of suffering. The rest are not. How can it be said that all impure conditioned dharmas are the truth of suffering?

['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b17_6']	此中可意有漏行法，由壞苦合故名為苦，未離染者於彼壞時必定應生憂愁等故。	此中可意有漏行法，由壞苦合故名為苦，未離染者於彼壞時必定應生憂愁等故。	029	In this context, agreeable contaminated dharmas are called suffering because they are associated with the suffering of change, because when they change, those who are not free from attachment necessarily experience sorrow and so on.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b17_15']	以薄伽梵契經中言：	以薄伽梵契經中言：	029	The Bhagavān said in a sūtra:

['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b25_2']	因緣所造皆是非常，有漏非常無非是苦，故有漏法皆是苦性。	因緣所造皆是非常，有漏非常無非是苦，故有漏法皆是苦性。	029	All dharmas produced by causes and conditions are impermanent. All contaminated dharmas are impermanent and none are not suffering. Therefore, all contaminated dharmas are by nature suffering.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b26_1']	豈不一切有漏行法，據此皆容是行苦性。	豈不一切有漏行法，據此皆容是行苦性。	029	Isn't it the case that all contaminated conditioned dharmas are all included in the nature of suffering as the result of activity?
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914b26_19']	不應但說非苦樂受，及彼資糧為行苦性。	不應但說非苦樂受，及彼資糧為行苦性。	029	One should not say that only the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain and its requisites are the nature of suffering as the result of activity.

['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914c06_19']	一可以物破為細分、二可以慧析除餘法。	一可以物破為細分、二可以慧析除餘法。	029	One can be broken down into subtle parts, and the other can be analyzed by wisdom to remove other dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914c09_6']	謂且於色諸和合聚，破為細分彼覺便無，名世俗諦，猶如瓶等，非破瓶等為瓦等時，復可於中生瓶等覺。	謂且於色諸和合聚，破為細分彼覺便無，名世俗諦，猶如瓶等，非破瓶等為瓦等時，復可於中生瓶等覺。	029	That is to say, regarding the various composite aggregates of form, if they are broken down into subtle parts, the corresponding cognition will cease to exist, and they are called conventional truths, just like vases and so forth. When vases and so forth are broken into shards and so on, one cannot subsequently give rise to the cognition of vases and so on in relation to them.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914c11_4']	有和合聚，雖破為多，彼覺非無，猶如水等，若以勝慧析除餘法，彼覺方無，亦世俗諦。	有和合聚，雖破為多，彼覺非無，猶如水等，若以勝慧析除餘法，彼覺方無，亦世俗諦。	029	There are composite aggregates such that, although they are broken into many parts, the corresponding cognition does not cease to exist, just like water and so forth. If they are analyzed by superior wisdom to remove other dharmas, the corresponding cognition will then cease to exist. They are also conventional truths.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914c12_6']	非水等被慧析除色等時，復可於中生水等覺。	非水等被慧析除色等時，復可於中生水等覺。	029	When water and so forth are analyzed by wisdom to remove form and so on, one cannot subsequently give rise to the cognition of water and so forth in relation to them.
['ZH_T29_1563_029:0914c13_14']	故於彼物未破析時，以世想名施設為彼，施設有故名為世俗。	故於彼物未破析時，以世想名施設為彼，施設有故名為世俗。	029	Therefore, when those substances have not yet been broken down, they are designated by conventional names in accordance with worldly conventions. Because they are designated, they are called conventional.
