['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c14_9']	此是頓部，非是頓教，以彼部中兼一別故，人不見者便謂華嚴頓於法華者誤矣。	此是頓部，非是頓教，以彼部中兼一別故，人不見者便謂華嚴頓於法華者誤矣。	002	This is a sudden part, not a sudden teaching, because within that part it also includes the one and the separate. Those who do not see it think that the Huayan is sudden in relation to the Lotus Sūtra, which is a mistake.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c17_3']	「頓說」下明說頓意，良由下說頓之由由相隔故。	「頓說」下明說頓意，良由下說頓之由由相隔故。	002	From suddenly speaking below it clarifies the intention of speaking suddenly. The reason for speaking suddenly is due to the separation of characteristics.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c17_21']	言「大隔小」者，小人未轉，為大所隔。	言「大隔小」者，小人未轉，為大所隔。	002	As for the great is separated from the small, the small person has not yet turned, and is separated by the great.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c19_1']	「此如華嚴」下結《華嚴》譬以同涅槃，故云「如」也。	「此如華嚴」下結《華嚴》譬以同涅槃，故云「如」也。	002	From this is like the Huayan below, it concludes the Huayan analogy to be the same as the Nirvana Sutra, so it says like.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c22_18']	次照幽谷，亦先提《華嚴》譬，「淺行」下亦舉感應以合譬，乃至《法華》文中皆有結譬同法得益。	次照幽谷，亦先提《華嚴》譬，「淺行」下亦舉感應以合譬，乃至《法華》文中皆有結譬同法得益。	002	Next, illuminating the hidden valleys, first citing the parable of the Flower Ornament Sutra, shallow practice and below also use stimulus and response to match the parable, up to the Lotus Sutra, the text all has concluding parables, the same Dharma gaining benefits.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c24_3']	結名結說次第，尋初頓教意以對下四味，比說可知。	結名結說次第，尋初頓教意以對下四味，比說可知。	002	The sequence of concluding the name and concluding the teaching, seeking the initial sudden teaching, to correspond with the four flavors below, the explanation can be known.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c25_7']	唯三藏結部名在前，餘文或闕說意等，尋之可見。	唯三藏結部名在前，餘文或闕說意等，尋之可見。	002	Only the conclusion of the name of the chapter in the Tripiṭaka is at the beginning, the rest of the text may lack the meaning of the teaching, etc., seeking it can be seen.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c28_10']	「大雖在座」等者，大人示迹隱在小中，「多跢」是學行之相，「嘙啝」是習語之聲，示為三藏始行初教，而三藏實行者謂之為實，故云「不識」。	「大雖在座」等者，大人示迹隱在小中，「多跢」是學行之相，「嘙啝」是習語之聲，示為三藏始行初教，而三藏實行者謂之為實，故云「不識」。	002	Although the great one is in the seat and so on, the great person shows traces, hidden in the small, duō tuó is the appearance of learning and practice, wēi wēi is the sound of learning to speak, showing to be the initial teaching of the beginning practitioner of the Tripiṭaka, while the actual practitioner of the Tripiṭaka considers it to be real, therefore it is said not recognized.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c29_17']	「影臨萬水」至「方等」者，至方等中具說四教，以未融故，故見不同。	「影臨萬水」至「方等」者，至方等中具說四教，以未融故，故見不同。	002	As for the shadow reflected in myriad waters up to vaipulya, in the vaipulya period, the four teachings are fully expounded, but because they are not yet fused, the views are still different.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0822c29_19']	問：	問：	002	Question:
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a02_2']	華嚴鹿苑大小永融，纔說方等，則同座並聞者何？	華嚴鹿苑大小永融，纔說方等，則同座並聞者何？	002	In the Huayan and Deer Park, the great and small are permanently fused. As soon as the vaipulya is expounded, why are they all heard together on the same seat?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a02_4']	答：	答：	002	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a06_12']	若以祕密橫被無時不遍，若約橫論豎則隱顯在機，佛本意在大故遂本居初，然由一分漸機致使聖慈未暢，前已專大、次復專小，今雖同座大小仍隔，但小被大彈為成生蘇，以此為次耳。	若以祕密橫被無時不遍，若約橫論豎則隱顯在機，佛本意在大故遂本居初，然由一分漸機致使聖慈未暢，前已專大、次復專小，今雖同座大小仍隔，但小被大彈為成生蘇，以此為次耳。	002	If the secret teachings are applied horizontally, they are everywhere at all times. If we discuss the vertical in terms of the horizontal, the hidden and revealed are in the capacity of the audience. The Buddha's original intention is in the great, so he originally abided in the beginning. However, due to the gradual capacity of a portion of the audience, the sage's compassion was not yet fully expressed. Previously, he exclusively taught the great, and next, he exclusively taught the small. Now, although they are on the same seat, the great and small are still separated. However, the small is criticized by the great to form the mature milk. This is considered the sequence.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a07_16']	故知於創稟者，仍互不相知，故有此諸喻意不同。	故知於創稟者，仍互不相知，故有此諸喻意不同。	002	Therefore, we know that for those who initially received the teachings, they still do not know each other, so there are these various metaphors with different meanings.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a10_3']	「影臨萬水」譬現身不同，「逐器方圓」譬示土不同，「隨波動靜」譬說法不同，「示一佛土」至「不共」合譬也。	「影臨萬水」譬現身不同，「逐器方圓」譬示土不同，「隨波動靜」譬說法不同，「示一佛土」至「不共」合譬也。	002	The shadow reflected in myriad waters illustrates the different appearances of the body, following the vessel's squareness or roundness illustrates the different lands shown, following the waves' movement or stillness illustrates the different teachings, and showing a single buddha land up to not in common combines the parables.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a12_15']	從「故見有」下明機見不同，對前三相，初見淨如梵王、見穢如身子，開彼三相，總引經文，兼約六根明斥小也。	從「故見有」下明機見不同，對前三相，初見淨如梵王、見穢如身子，開彼三相，總引經文，兼約六根明斥小也。	002	From Therefore, seeing there is below, it clarifies the different perceptions of the capacities, corresponding to the previous three characteristics. Initially seeing purity is like Brahma, seeing impurity is like Śāriputra. Opening those three characteristics, it generally cites the sutra text, and also uses the six sense faculties to clarify the refutation of the Lesser Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a13_9']	「見有淨穢」對前現土眼根也。	「見有淨穢」對前現土眼根也。	002	Seeing purity and impurity corresponds to the previously manifested lands, which is the eye faculty.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a14_13']	亦應更云覩相優劣，已舉見土身必稱土，故不繁文。	亦應更云覩相優劣，已舉見土身必稱土，故不繁文。	002	It should also further say seeing the superiority and inferiority of appearances. Since the body must correspond to the land, the text is not verbose.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a15_3']	「聞有褒貶」，耳根也。	「聞有褒貶」，耳根也。	002	Hearing praise and blame is the ear faculty.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a15_14']	「嗅有薝蔔」，鼻根也。	「嗅有薝蔔」，鼻根也。	002	Smelling jasmine is the nose faculty.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a15_25']	「華有著身」，身根也。	「華有著身」，身根也。	002	The flower adheres to the body is the body faculty.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a16_10']	「慧有若干」，意根也。	「慧有若干」，意根也。	002	Wisdom has various kinds is the mind faculty.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a17_14']	若語身者，應云如須彌山巨身也；	若語身者，應云如須彌山巨身也；	002	If speaking of the body, it should say the body is as large as Mount Sumeru;
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a18_5']	始坐佛樹，細身也。	始坐佛樹，細身也。	002	sitting under the bodhi tree, the body is small.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a19_13']	又佛歎文殊、淨名，褒也。	又佛歎文殊、淨名，褒也。	002	Moreover, the Buddha praises Mañjuśrī and Vimalakīrti, which is praise;
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a20_2']	聲聞菩薩被折，貶也。	聲聞菩薩被折，貶也。	002	the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas are reprimanded, which is criticism.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a20_11']	其例蓋多不能具記。	其例蓋多不能具記。	002	There are many such examples, but I cannot record them all.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a22_2']	隨其心淨即佛土淨，入此室者不嗅餘香，結習盡者華不著也。	隨其心淨即佛土淨，入此室者不嗅餘香，結習盡者華不著也。	002	In accordance with the purity of the mind, the Buddha land is pure. Those who enter this room do not smell other fragrances. For those whose habitual tendencies are exhausted, the flowers do not stick.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a22_17']	聲聞有若干，其無礙慧無若干也。	聲聞有若干，其無礙慧無若干也。	002	There are various śrāvakas, but their unobstructed wisdom is not various.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a23_5']	即是褒貶之意。	即是褒貶之意。	002	This is the meaning of praise and criticism.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a25_17']	世人判《楞伽》，或同《華嚴》，或同《法華》，具如《止觀》記已有二處引《楞伽》文判屬方等，以彼經文具四教故、有彈訶故。	世人判《楞伽》，或同《華嚴》，或同《法華》，具如《止觀》記已有二處引《楞伽》文判屬方等，以彼經文具四教故、有彈訶故。	002	Worldly people classify the Laṅkā Sutra as either the same as the Flower Ornament Sutra or the same as the Lotus Sutra. As explained in the Zhizhe Chanfa, there are already two places that cite the Laṅkā Sutra to classify it as the vaipulya sutras, because the sutra text contains the four teachings and has reprimands.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a27_1']	此中闕說意，應云方等本折小彈偏，圓無所間。	此中闕說意，應云方等本折小彈偏，圓無所間。	002	Here, the meaning of the mind is omitted, and it should be said that the Vaipulya [sutras] originally refuted the Lesser Vehicle and criticized the biased [teachings], but the Perfect [Vehicle] has nothing to be criticized.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823a28_6']	又闕說由，應云良由小未全轉，致使五百聞大成斥。	又闕說由，應云良由小未全轉，致使五百聞大成斥。	002	Moreover, the reason is omitted, and it should be said that it is precisely because the Lesser Vehicle has not yet completely turned that it causes the five hundred [monks] to hear the refutation of the Great [Vehicle].
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b02_12']	「復有義」者，《華嚴經》譬但云平地，今離彼平地，以譬方等般若法華，方等如食時，般若如禺中，法華如正中，於彼義上更加二義，故云「復有」。	「復有義」者，《華嚴經》譬但云平地，今離彼平地，以譬方等般若法華，方等如食時，般若如禺中，法華如正中，於彼義上更加二義，故云「復有」。	002	As for there is another meaning, the Huayan Sutra only uses the analogy of flat ground. Now, apart from that flat ground, it is used as an analogy for the Vaipulya, Prajna, and Lotus Sutras. The Vaipulya is like the meal time, the Prajna is like noon, and the Lotus is like midday. On top of that meaning, two more meanings are added, so it says there is another.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b06_12']	言「大人蒙其光用」等者，菩薩大人蒙般若光諸法之用，二乘之人既無此用，是故譬之如七日嬰兒若視日輪令眼失光，故名為「喪」，外人暗證譬如夜遊，菩薩利他譬如作務。	言「大人蒙其光用」等者，菩薩大人蒙般若光諸法之用，二乘之人既無此用，是故譬之如七日嬰兒若視日輪令眼失光，故名為「喪」，外人暗證譬如夜遊，菩薩利他譬如作務。	002	As for the great beings are illuminated by its light and function, the great beings of the bodhisattvas are illuminated by the light of prajna and the function of all dharmas. Since the people of the two vehicles do not have this function, it is therefore likened to a seven-day-old infant. If they look at the sun, their eyes will lose their light, so it is called lost. The externalist's obscure realization is like traveling at night, while the bodhisattvas' benefiting others is like working.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b06_20']	「務」者運役也。	「務」者運役也。	002	To strive means to exert oneself.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b09_1']	故「文云」下引信解聲聞自述以合嬰兒喪其睛明，一切智明於般若光，無明全在義之如喪。	故「文云」下引信解聲聞自述以合嬰兒喪其睛明，一切智明於般若光，無明全在義之如喪。	002	Therefore, below the text says, it cites the self-statement of the śrāvakas' faith and understanding to match the infant losing its bright eyes. The bright eyes of omniscience are the light of prajñā. The meaning of the complete presence of ignorance is like losing [the eyes].
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b09_13']	「雖三人俱學」下說意也。	「雖三人俱學」下說意也。	002	Although the three people study together below explains the intention.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b10_14']	仍闕說由，亦應云良由小稍通泰，致使被加令說。	仍闕說由，亦應云良由小稍通泰，致使被加令說。	002	It still lacks the explanation of the reason. It should also say, It is precisely because the lesser [vehicle] is gradually becoming more open and expansive that it causes them to be empowered to explain [the Mahāyāna].
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b12_5']	次譬法華中「土圭」等者，「圭」者累土也，故字從重土謂之為圭。	次譬法華中「土圭」等者，「圭」者累土也，故字從重土謂之為圭。	002	Next, in the analogy of the Lotus Sūtra, a soil cubit and so forth. Cubit means piling up soil, so the character is made from a heavy soil called a cubit.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b15_15']	如宋嚴觀法師與此太史官何承天，共論此土是邊是中，觀乃引周公測影之法，以一尺二寸土圭用測日影，夏至之日猶有餘陰，天竺此日則無餘陰。	如宋嚴觀法師與此太史官何承天，共論此土是邊是中，觀乃引周公測影之法，以一尺二寸土圭用測日影，夏至之日猶有餘陰，天竺此日則無餘陰。	002	Like Song Dynasty Dharma Master Yan Guan discussing with the court astronomer He Chengtian whether this land is a border or the center, Guan then cited the method of Zhou Gong's measurement of shadows, using a soil cubit of one chi and two cun to measure the sun's shadow. On the summer solstice, there is still remaining shade, but in India, this day has no remaining shade.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b17_2']	故叡法師云「如日方中無處不南」，此指中方無餘陰處。	故叡法師云「如日方中無處不南」，此指中方無餘陰處。	002	Therefore, Dharma Master Rui said, Just as when the sun is at noon there is no place that is not south, referring to how there is no place in the central region that is not illuminated.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b17_16']	準此算法，地上寸影天上萬里。	準此算法，地上寸影天上萬里。	002	According to this mathematical calculation, on the ground an inch of shadow corresponds to ten thousand miles in the sky.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b19_19']	「若低頭若微善」者，總結散亂、小善之類無不開之，以成佛因，以用合譬，同入一實，故無盈縮。	「若低頭若微善」者，總結散亂、小善之類無不開之，以成佛因，以用合譬，同入一實，故無盈縮。	002	Whether bowing the head or performing a slight wholesome deed summarizes the various types of scattered thoughts and small wholesome deeds that are all revealed to become causes for attaining Buddhahood. Using this to correspond with the parable, they all enter the one true reality, so there is no expansion or contraction.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b20_7']	「不令」下說意。	「不令」下說意。	002	Not allowing and below explains the intention.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b21_15']	亦闕說由，應云良由大機已熟，眾無枝葉，致使一切佛知見開。	亦闕說由，應云良由大機已熟，眾無枝葉，致使一切佛知見開。	002	It also lacks the explanation of the reason, which should say that it is precisely because the great capacity has matured, the assembly is without branches and leaves, causing all the Buddha's wisdom and insight to be revealed.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b23_11']	「若約法被緣名漸圓教」者，此文語略，具足應云鹿苑漸後會漸歸圓，故云漸圓。	「若約法被緣名漸圓教」者，此文語略，具足應云鹿苑漸後會漸歸圓，故云漸圓。	002	If it is called the gradual and perfect teaching based on the Dharma being applied to conditions - this passage is concise, and in full detail it should say that after the gradual of the Deer Park, the gradual returns to the perfect, thus it is called gradual and perfect.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b26_15']	人不見之，便謂法華為漸圓，華嚴為頓圓，不知華嚴部中有別，乃至般若中方便二教皆從法華一乘開出，故云「於一佛乘分別說三」。	人不見之，便謂法華為漸圓，華嚴為頓圓，不知華嚴部中有別，乃至般若中方便二教皆從法華一乘開出，故云「於一佛乘分別說三」。	002	People do not see this and consider the Lotus Sūtra to be gradual and perfect, and the Huayan to be sudden and perfect. They do not know that within the Huayan canon there are distinctions, and even within the Prajñāpāramitā there are two teachings of skillful means that all come from the opening of the One Vehicle of the Lotus Sūtra. Therefore, it is said, In the One Buddha Vehicle, the Three are distinguished and taught.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b27_11']	故疏云「於一佛乘開出，帶二帶三」。	故疏云「於一佛乘開出，帶二帶三」。	002	Therefore, the commentary says, From the One Buddha Vehicle, the Two and the Three are opened and revealed.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b28_7']	今法華部無彼二三，故云無二亦無三。	今法華部無彼二三，故云無二亦無三。	002	Now, in the Lotus Sūtra canon there are no longer those Two and Three, so it is said there are no Two and no Three.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823b29_16']	又上結云華嚴兼等，此經無復兼但對帶，此非難見，如何固迷？	又上結云華嚴兼等，此經無復兼但對帶，此非難見，如何固迷？	002	Moreover, above it is concluded that the Huayan is mixed and so forth, but this sūtra is no longer mixed but only opposed to the revealed. This is not difficult to see, so how can one stubbornly remain confused?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823c02_9']	又今文諸義凡一一科皆先約四教，以約麁妙，則前三為麁、後一為妙。	又今文諸義凡一一科皆先約四教，以約麁妙，則前三為麁、後一為妙。	002	Moreover, in each section of the present text, it first discusses the Four Teachings, and by discussing the coarse and subtle, the first three are coarse and the last one is subtle.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823c05_2']	次約五味以判麁妙，則前四味為麁、醍醐為妙，全不推求上下文意，直指一語便謂法華劣於華嚴，幾許誤哉！	次約五味以判麁妙，則前四味為麁、醍醐為妙，全不推求上下文意，直指一語便謂法華劣於華嚴，幾許誤哉！	002	Next, if we use the five flavors to distinguish the coarse and subtle, then the first four flavors are coarse and the finest flavor is subtle. Completely not seeking the meaning of the context, directly pointing to a single word and saying that the Lotus Sutra is inferior to the Huayan Sutra, how mistaken!
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823c05_7']	幾許誤哉！	幾許誤哉！	002	How mistaken!
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823c08_16']	「約說次第名醍醐味相」者，此五味教相生之文，在第十三〈聖行品〉末，佛印無垢藏王菩薩竟，云譬如從牛出乳乃至醍醐，譬從佛出十二部經乃至涅槃。	「約說次第名醍醐味相」者，此五味教相生之文，在第十三〈聖行品〉末，佛印無垢藏王菩薩竟，云譬如從牛出乳乃至醍醐，譬從佛出十二部經乃至涅槃。	002	Using the order of the teachings to name the finest flavor means that the text on the arising of the characteristics of the five flavors is at the end of the chapter on the holy practices in the thirteenth chapter. After the Buddha has certified the bodhisattva King of the Treasury of No-defilements, it says, It is like milk coming from a cow up to ghee. It is like the twelve divisions of the sutras coming from the Buddha up to nirvana.

The remaining capacities reach there like remnants and factions are not difficult. Therefore, the Lotus Sutra is the great harvest, and the Nirvana Sutra is the gleaning.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0823c15_3']	若不爾者，《涅槃》不應遙指八千聲聞於法華中得授記莂，見如來性，如秋收冬藏更無所作。	若不爾者，《涅槃》不應遙指八千聲聞於法華中得授記莂，見如來性，如秋收冬藏更無所作。	002	If it were not so, the Nirvana Sutra should not remotely point to the eight thousand shravakas who in the Lotus Sutra received the prediction of their future enlightenment, saw the nature of the Tathagata, like the autumn harvest and winter storage, with nothing more to do.

The sun rising and other parables in the Flower Ornament Sutra are the same as the five flavors in the Nirvana Sutra, but there is only a difference in breadth.

Sunakṣatra was the Buddha's son when he was a bodhisattva. He severed the bonds of the desire realm and realized the fourth dhyāna. Why did the Tathāgata prophesy that he is a icchantika, one who will dwell in hell for an eon and cannot be cured?

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0824a20_15']	故《涅槃》云「功用無二」。	故《涅槃》云「功用無二」。	002	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, The two functions are non-dual.

The question is, since the characteristics and flavors of the five flavors are already five, why are the three flavors in the middle all called gradual?

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0824b02_2']	從「又若」去重以五句分別漸頓，且約一期五味相生，則漸頓一向，若當部橫辨則漸頓互通，雖曰互通各有其意，故須更以五句分別。	從「又若」去重以五句分別漸頓，且約一期五味相生，則漸頓一向，若當部橫辨則漸頓互通，雖曰互通各有其意，故須更以五句分別。	002	From Again, if onwards, the gradual and sudden are distinguished again with five phrases. For now, it is about the gradual and sudden in terms of the five flavors arising from each other in one period. If it is about the horizontal discussion in a certain teaching, then the gradual and sudden mutually penetrate each other. Although it is said that they mutually penetrate, each has its own meaning, so it is necessary to further distinguish them with five phrases.

For now, it is said like this by comparing the great and small vehicles. If it is about the discussion of the gradual in the separate teaching, it should be said that the sudden includes the gradual, and the gradual does not obstruct the sudden. For now, it is for the sake of forming five phrases to manifest the five flavors.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0824b06_11']	若言漸中有頓則下方等句同，故略不列且云一向。	若言漸中有頓則下方等句同，故略不列且云一向。	002	If it is said that there is the sudden within the gradual, then the following phrases are the same, so it is briefly not listed and just said to be one-sided.

For now, it is said from the perspective of ripening the small vehicle.

There are also those who initially enter the small practices in the gradual, such as seeing the land as defiled and attaining the purity of the Dharma eye, and speaking of impermanence outside the room for the lay followers. Because the small is opposed to the great, it is called presented side by side.

As the commentary says, the opening is the preface for the combination. Since the immeasurable meaning is again a preface for the previous opening, it will not be long before it must be combined.

In the Vaipulya, the great is a resource for the small. In the assembly of the Prajnaparamita, hearing adds two people. Speaking for bodhisattvas is called a small resource for the great.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0824b20_11']	亦應云頓資漸，互出無在。	亦應云頓資漸，互出無在。	002	It should also be said that the sudden is a resource for the gradual, and vice versa, there is no fixed order.

Without choosing time and place, the body, speech, and mind are secret, and according to any of the four gates, there is unobstructed freedom. Adapting to the time and meeting the occasion, all are not in vain.

It should be said that the three teachings each have their own return, but they do not reach the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827b14_10']	次山譬者，經中具列土山黑山小大鐵圍及十寶山，以比須彌。	次山譬者，經中具列土山黑山小大鐵圍及十寶山，以比須彌。	002	Next, the metaphor of the mountain. The sutra fully lists earth mountains, black mountains, small and large iron enclosures, and the ten jeweled mountains, comparing them to Mount Sumeru.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827b17_12']	天居四寶頂如醍醐在四味上，反以四寶譬四誹謗，天居其上如教離謗也。	天居四寶頂如醍醐在四味上，反以四寶譬四誹謗，天居其上如教離謗也。	002	The heavens dwell on the peak of the four treasures, like ghee on top of the four flavors. The four treasures are used as a metaphor for the four kinds of slander. The heavens dwelling above them is like the teaching of leaving slander.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827b18_4']	四謗如前《金剛藏》意。	四謗如前《金剛藏》意。	002	The four kinds of slander are as explained in the meaning of Vajragarbha above.

The various heavens are not apart from the four jeweled mountains.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827b21_15']	若盡消經者，應以土等四山如四味，須彌在十山之內而最高，如佛界在十界之內而最勝。	若盡消經者，應以土等四山如四味，須彌在十山之內而最高，如佛界在十界之內而最勝。	002	If one completely analyzes the sutra, one should use the four mountains such as earth as the four flavors. Mount Sumeru is within the ten mountains and is the highest, like the Buddha realm being within the ten realms and being the most supreme.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827b23_12']	次月譬者，實如盈、權如虧，同體權實如月輪無缺，會漸入頓如月明相漸圓。	次月譬者，實如盈、權如虧，同體權實如月輪無缺，會漸入頓如月明相漸圓。	002	Next, the moon metaphor: the real is like waxing, and the provisional is like waning. The same essence of provisional and real is like the moon disc having no defects. Uniting the gradual and entering the sudden is like the bright appearance of the moon gradually becoming full.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827b24_15']	故知前標教相中云「是漸頓」者，與月譬意同。	故知前標教相中云「是漸頓」者，與月譬意同。	002	Therefore, one should know that the statement in the previous section on the characteristics of the teaching that it is gradual and sudden has the same meaning as the moon metaphor.

Although the celestial king is mentioned, since the sutra combines it by saying this Lotus Sutra is the most illuminating, therefore now only the perfect is taken, and also the illumination is used as a metaphor.

Now, in the combination of the sun metaphor, it only says it destroys the provisional city, therefore it only takes the sun's illumination as able to eclipse all other lights.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827c01_7']	若更合者，亦可以燈等四，譬二乘及通別菩薩，並與無明共住故也。	若更合者，亦可以燈等四，譬二乘及通別菩薩，並與無明共住故也。	002	If further combined, the four such as lamps can also be used as metaphors for the two vehicles and the bodhisattvas of the shared and distinct teachings, because they all dwell together with ignorance.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827c08_4']	輪王地居如俗，釋王居天如真，梵於三界如中，若真俗自在、中未必自在，若中自在、真俗必自在，故以今經譬於梵王。	輪王地居如俗，釋王居天如真，梵於三界如中，若真俗自在、中未必自在，若中自在、真俗必自在，故以今經譬於梵王。	002	The wheel-turning king is on the earth, like the mundane; the king of the Shakra heaven is in the heavens, like the true; Brahma is in the three realms, like the middle. If it is the mundane and the true, it may be sovereign, but the middle may not be sovereign. If it is sovereign in the middle, the mundane and the true must be sovereign. Therefore, the present sutra is compared to the Brahma King.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0827c10_6']	文中便簡歷別中道亦非自在，且約教道，故知梵王兼譬二中，今譬圓融故云「最」也。	文中便簡歷別中道亦非自在，且約教道，故知梵王兼譬二中，今譬圓融故云「最」也。	002	In the text, it is said that the separate and distinct middle way is also not sovereign. It is just about the path of teaching, so it is known that the Brahma King is compared to the two middles. Now it is compared to the perfect and harmonious, so it is said the most.

Using this benefits others, and it is both expedient and real, responding to the long-term spiritual capacities of sentient beings, so it is finer than the purport. The characteristics of the teachings are the discrimination of the previous four, so they are finer than the four, and therefore placed last.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828a23_15']	然五章玄義亦不出自他事理，今更以此事理等五雙橫判五章，以一一雙皆攝五章故也。	然五章玄義亦不出自他事理，今更以此事理等五雙橫判五章，以一一雙皆攝五章故也。	002	However, the profound meaning of the five chapters is also not beyond self, other, phenomena, principle, etc. Now, using these five pairs of phenomena and principle, etc., to horizontally classify the five chapters, each pair includes the five chapters.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828a25_5']	雖自他事理稍同，而一一章則不攝五雙，故知法相文義各別；	雖自他事理稍同，而一一章則不攝五雙，故知法相文義各別；	002	Although self, other, phenomena, principle, etc. are slightly the same, each chapter does not include the five pairs, so we know that the characteristics of dharmas and the meaning of the text are different.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828a28_4']	雖並攝五章，而五雙生起次第宛別，由有事理故有教行，由教行為因故感於果，由因果滿故能化他，由他機異故宜說宜默。	雖並攝五章，而五雙生起次第宛別，由有事理故有教行，由教行為因故感於果，由因果滿故能化他，由他機異故宜說宜默。	002	Although they all include the five chapters, the sequence of the five pairs is completely different. Because there are phenomena and principle, there is teaching and practice. Because teaching and practice are the cause, they give rise to the effect. Because the cause and effect are fulfilled, they are able to transform others. Because the capacities of others are different, they should be taught or silent.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b11_8']	廢權顯實，權若廢已，權實不二，豈不墮因中有果耶？	廢權顯實，權若廢已，權實不二，豈不墮因中有果耶？	002	In the case of discarding the provisional to reveal the real, if the provisional is discarded, the non-duality of provisional and real would not fall into the existence of cause within effect, would it?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b12_2']	答意者，因果名同，時異教異。	答意者，因果名同，時異教異。	002	The meaning of the answer is: The names of cause and effect are the same, but the time and teaching are different.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b13_9']	外人因果既為初教所破，尚非三藏麁因麁果，況復通別？	外人因果既為初教所破，尚非三藏麁因麁果，況復通別？	002	Since the causes and effects of outsiders have already been refuted by the initial teaching, they are not even the coarse causes and coarse effects of the Tripiṭaka, let alone the Shared and Distinct [Teachings]?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b13_15']	況妙因果耶？	況妙因果耶？	002	How much less so the wondrous causes and effects?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b14_3']	新舊醫如餘文說。	新舊醫如餘文說。	002	The new and old doctors are explained in other texts.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b16_1']	次問者，此問依前答生，前答妙因妙果因果俱時，華果體即，小乘屬權，權亦即實；	次問者，此問依前答生，前答妙因妙果因果俱時，華果體即，小乘屬權，權亦即實；	002	Next, the question arises based on the previous answer. The previous answer states that the wondrous causes and effects are simultaneous, with the flower and fruit being identical in substance. The Lesser Vehicle belongs to the provisional, and the provisional is also identical to the real;
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b16_11']	菴城亦小，何不即耶？	菴城亦小，何不即耶？	002	The city of the womb is also small, so why not identify it?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b17_11']	若破菴城則無華唯蓮，破權方實即義安在？	若破菴城則無華唯蓮，破權方實即義安在？	002	If the city of the womb is refuted, then there are only lotus flowers and no flowers. Refuting the provisional and revealing the real, where is the meaning of identification?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b19_11']	答「小乘是化他」乃至「喻耳」者，且約初說小隔於大，是故云破，以大破之，故云「須破」。	答「小乘是化他」乃至「喻耳」者，且約初說小隔於大，是故云破，以大破之，故云「須破」。	002	The answer states, The Lesser Vehicle is for transforming others... up to it is a metaphor. It is said that the initial teaching of the Lesser Vehicle is separate from the Great, and therefore it is said to be refuted. Since the Great refutes it, it is said to need to be refuted.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b20_17']	自行即是體內之權故以華喻，然化他之權據佛本意並屬自行。	自行即是體內之權故以華喻，然化他之權據佛本意並屬自行。	002	One's own practice is the provisional within the essence, and therefore it is likened to a flower. However, the provisional for transforming others, according to the Buddha's original intention, all belongs to one's own practice.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b22_10']	又初約施權故屬化他，今論開權故屬自行，施開被緣其理不二。	又初約施權故屬化他，今論開權故屬自行，施開被緣其理不二。	002	Moreover, the first is about expounding the provisional, so it belongs to transforming others, while now discussing the disclosure of the provisional belongs to one's own practice. Expounding and disclosing the provisional for the sake of conditions, the principle is not two.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b25_3']	七譬者，一火宅、二窮子、三藥草、四化城、五繫珠、六頂珠、七醫子，須以七譬各對蓮華權實之義，方得顯於總別意耳。	七譬者，一火宅、二窮子、三藥草、四化城、五繫珠、六頂珠、七醫子，須以七譬各對蓮華權實之義，方得顯於總別意耳。	002	The seven parables are: 1. the burning house, 2. the poor son, 3. the medicinal herbs, 4. the transformed city, 5. the tied jewel, 6. the jewel on the head, 7. the doctor and son. They must each correspond to the meaning of the provisional and real of the lotus flower, only then can the general and specific meanings be revealed.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b25_6']	何者？	何者？	002	What is it?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b26_11']	蓮華秖是為實施權、開權顯實，七譬皆然，故得名別。	蓮華秖是為實施權、開權顯實，七譬皆然，故得名別。	002	The lotus flower is precisely for the sake of expounding the provisional for the real and disclosing the provisional to reveal the real. The seven parables are all like this, so they can be called specific.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b27_12']	如譬喻中，初設三車是施權，後賜大車是顯實。	如譬喻中，初設三車是施權，後賜大車是顯實。	002	As in the parable, first setting up the three vehicles is expounding the provisional, and later bestowing the great vehicle is revealing the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b28_13']	窮子中，雇作已前是施權，體業已後是顯實。	窮子中，雇作已前是施權，體業已後是顯實。	002	In the poor son, before being hired is expounding the provisional, and after accepting the work is revealing the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b29_13']	藥草中，三草二木是施權，一地一雨是顯實。	藥草中，三草二木是施權，一地一雨是顯實。	002	In the medicinal herbs, the three grasses and two trees are expounding the provisional, and the one earth and one rain are revealing the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828b30_13']	化城中，為疲設化是施權，引至寶所是顯實。	化城中，為疲設化是施權，引至寶所是顯實。	002	In the transformed city, creating the transformation for the sake of fatigue is expounding the provisional, and leading to the treasure site is revealing the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c01_14']	繫珠中，得少為足是稟權，後示衣珠是顯實。	繫珠中，得少為足是稟權，後示衣珠是顯實。	002	In the section on tying the pearl, being content with little is following the provisional, while later showing the pearl in the robe is revealing the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c02_15']	頂珠中，隨功賞賜是施權，解髻與珠是顯實。	頂珠中，隨功賞賜是施權，解髻與珠是顯實。	002	In the section on the top pearl, rewarding according to merit is bestowing the provisional, while unravelling the topknot and giving the pearl is revealing the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c04_13']	醫子中，非生現生、非滅現滅，各有形聲權實二益，生滅迹也，非生非滅本也。	醫子中，非生現生、非滅現滅，各有形聲權實二益，生滅迹也，非生非滅本也。	002	In the section on the doctor's son, not being born yet appearing to be born, not perishing yet appearing to perish, each has the two benefits of provisional and real in form and sound. Birth and death are the traces, non-birth and non-death are the basis.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c07_1']	故前六約迹、後一約本，故知蓮華總譬本迹權實，本迹同異之相具如後簡，故知但語蓮華則兼別矣。	故前六約迹、後一約本，故知蓮華總譬本迹權實，本迹同異之相具如後簡，故知但語蓮華則兼別矣。	002	Therefore, the first six are about the traces, and the last one is about the basis. Therefore, it is known that the lotus flower metaphorically illustrates the basis, traces, provisional and real. The same and different aspects of the basis and traces are fully explained in the later selection. Therefore, it is known that if only speaking of the lotus flower, it also includes the separate teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c09_1']	次問體者，此問準文及理為問，一切諸法皆是法界無非實相，則諸法皆體，何意簡權？	次問體者，此問準文及理為問，一切諸法皆是法界無非實相，則諸法皆體，何意簡權？	002	Next, the question on essence is a question based on the text and principle. All dharmas are the Dharma realm, none are not the true aspect. Then all dharmas are the essence. Why is it necessary to select the provisional?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c10_6']	答意者，若為實施權未識經體，開權顯實實如所問。	答意者，若為實施權未識經體，開權顯實實如所問。	002	The meaning of the answer is: If the provisional is bestowed for the real, the essence of the sutra is not yet known. Opening the provisional and revealing the real, the real is as asked.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c11_13']	「廢權顯實如前所用」者，謂約廢說則簡權取實，以為經體。	「廢權顯實如前所用」者，謂約廢說則簡權取實，以為經體。	002	Discarding the provisional and revealing the real as used before means that in terms of discarding, the provisional is selected and the real is taken as the essence of the sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c11_16']	何者？	何者？	002	What is that?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c13_19']	廢已無權，簡於為實施權之權，如前標體中簡於自行化他及化他體，故云「如前所用」。	廢已無權，簡於為實施權之權，如前標體中簡於自行化他及化他體，故云「如前所用」。	002	After discarding, there is no more provisional. The provisional that was used to establish the provisional for the sake of the real is selected. It is like selecting the essence of practice for oneself, practice for others, and the essence of practice for others in the previous section on the essence. Therefore, it says as used before.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c14_11']	次問宗者，宗猶尊也主也。	次問宗者，宗猶尊也主也。	002	Next, the question on the main purport. The main purport is like the honored one or the master.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c15_8']	如國無二王，何以用二法為宗耶？	如國無二王，何以用二法為宗耶？	002	If a country has no two kings, why use two dharmas as the main purport?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c16_4']	答意者，因果雖二而不二也。	答意者，因果雖二而不二也。	002	The meaning of the answer is that although cause and effect are two, they are not two.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c17_15']	以單因單果不獨成故，有果可取因為果因，果若有因果為因果。	以單因單果不獨成故，有果可取因為果因，果若有因果為因果。	002	Because a single cause and a single effect are not accomplished alone, there is a result that can be taken as the cause of the result, and if there is a cause of the result, the result is the cause of the cause.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c20_6']	故知能辦藉所為期、所辦藉能而顯，如臣辦王事、王能理臣，君臣相藉共經一國，異類為譬其理亦成。	故知能辦藉所為期、所辦藉能而顯，如臣辦王事、王能理臣，君臣相藉共經一國，異類為譬其理亦成。	002	Therefore, it should be known that the ability to accomplish depends on what is to be accomplished, and what is to be accomplished depends on the ability to manifest. It is like a minister accomplishing the king's affairs, and the king being able to govern the ministers. The ruler and ministers depend on each other to jointly govern a country. The analogy of different kinds also makes the principle be established.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c21_2']	況下文日月綱天等譬，文意可知。	況下文日月綱天等譬，文意可知。	002	How much more so for the similes of the sun and moon governing the heavens and so forth in the following text, the meaning of which can be understood.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c23_8']	論宗既取自行，論用何故俱取自他？	論宗既取自行，論用何故俱取自他？	002	Since the main purport of the treatise takes self-benefit, why does the main use take both self and other?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c23_12']	答如文。	答如文。	002	The answer is as the text.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c24_11']	此下諸問對簡者，正為簡用兼為顯宗。	此下諸問對簡者，正為簡用兼為顯宗。	002	The following questions and distinctions are made precisely to distinguish the use and to reveal the main purport.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c26_7']	「問用是化他」等者，牒答重徵，宗是自行，既不取化他，用是益他，應簡自行。	「問用是化他」等者，牒答重徵，宗是自行，既不取化他，用是益他，應簡自行。	002	Asking about the use being for benefiting others and so forth cites the answer and re-examines it. Since the main purport is self-benefit, it does not take benefiting others. Since the use is for benefiting others, it should distinguish self-benefit.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0828c27_12']	答中意者，若自破惑但用實道，名為自用，自必簡他。	答中意者，若自破惑但用實道，名為自用，自必簡他。	002	The meaning of the answer is this: If one breaks through one's own delusions and only uses the true path, it is called one's own use. One's own use must distinguish from others.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a01_2']	若破他惑，他宜用大亦名為用，是故化他不可純小，是故亦用自行權實，若用於實，即以此實自利利他。	若破他惑，他宜用大亦名為用，是故化他不可純小，是故亦用自行權實，若用於實，即以此實自利利他。	002	If one breaks through others' delusions, it is appropriate for others to use the great and it is also called use. Therefore, benefiting others cannot be purely the small vehicle. Therefore, it also uses the provisional and true of one's own benefit. If one uses the true, then one uses this true for one's own benefit and for benefiting others.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a03_6']	次「並」意者，宗是因果，亦可示他名化他，宗亦應俱取化他因果自利利他，何故簡他唯取於自？	次「並」意者，宗是因果，亦可示他名化他，宗亦應俱取化他因果自利利他，何故簡他唯取於自？	002	Next, the meaning of both is that the main point is cause and effect, and it can also be called teaching others, and the main point should also be taken together as the cause and effect of teaching others and benefiting oneself and others. Why is it that only the self is taken, not others?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a04_6']	答意者，化他因果非一乘宗，是故不取。	答意者，化他因果非一乘宗，是故不取。	002	The meaning of the answer is that the cause and effect of teaching others is not the main point of the One Vehicle, and therefore it is not taken.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a05_13']	並意者，因果屬宗，何不亦以化他因果，共為經宗而利於他？	並意者，因果屬宗，何不亦以化他因果，共為經宗而利於他？	002	The meaning of both is that cause and effect belong to the main point. Why is it that the cause and effect of teaching others are not taken together as the main point of the sutra to benefit others?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a07_8']	答意者，宗屬自行唯求佛果，尚不取自行化他，況以化他因果而自行耶？	答意者，宗屬自行唯求佛果，尚不取自行化他，況以化他因果而自行耶？	002	The meaning of the answer is that the main point belongs to one's own practice and only seeks the fruit of Buddhahood. One does not even take one's own practice of teaching others, let alone take the cause and effect of teaching others as one's own practice?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a07_17']	以化他邊即屬用故。	以化他邊即屬用故。	002	Because the aspect of teaching others belongs to the function.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a08_13']	次「並」者，用中亦不應俱取？	次「並」者，用中亦不應俱取？	002	Next, the meaning of both is that in the function, one should not take both together?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a09_11']	答意者，化他漸誘，事不獲已，是故取之。	答意者，化他漸誘，事不獲已，是故取之。	002	The meaning of the answer is that teaching others gradually leads, and it cannot be helped, and therefore it is taken.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a11_9']	「問宗用俱明智斷」等者，正由向文或以宗難用、或以用難宗，恐法雜亂，故須此問。	「問宗用俱明智斷」等者，正由向文或以宗難用、或以用難宗，恐法雜亂，故須此問。	002	Asking about the teachings and practices both clarifying wisdom and elimination and so on means that because the previous text sometimes uses the teachings to challenge the practices, or uses the practices to challenge the teachings, fearing that the Dharma would become chaotic, this question is necessary.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a12_8']	宗是自行，用是化他，各有智斷，為同異耶？	宗是自行，用是化他，各有智斷，為同異耶？	002	The teachings are one's own practice, and the practices are teaching others. Each has wisdom and elimination. Are they the same or different?
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a14_4']	此文正問宗用智斷，然下答中於自於他各有智斷，宗是自行，用是化他故也。	此文正問宗用智斷，然下答中於自於他各有智斷，宗是自行，用是化他故也。	002	This text correctly asks about the wisdom and elimination in the teachings and practices. However, in the answer below, each has wisdom and elimination in terms of oneself and others. The teachings are one's own practice, and the practices are teaching others.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a15_4']	故以宗用釋於自他智斷不同，得名各別。	故以宗用釋於自他智斷不同，得名各別。	002	Therefore, using the teachings and practices to explain the wisdom and elimination in terms of oneself and others being different, the names are established separately.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a16_17']	前文既以自行為宗，化他為用，今此自他各有智斷，乃成自他各有宗用。	前文既以自行為宗，化他為用，今此自他各有智斷，乃成自他各有宗用。	002	Since the previous text takes one's own practice as the teachings and teaching others as the practices, now each of oneself and others has wisdom and elimination, which becomes each of oneself and others having the teachings and practices.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a17_18']	宗雖有用，用屬於斷，此乃名為宗家之用。	宗雖有用，用屬於斷，此乃名為宗家之用。	002	Although the teachings have practices, the practices belong to elimination. This is called the practices of the teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a19_6']	「自他智斷俱為宗」者，自行以智德為宗，化他以斷德為宗。	「自他智斷俱為宗」者，自行以智德為宗，化他以斷德為宗。	002	The wisdom and elimination of oneself and others are both the teachings means that in one's own practice, the virtue of wisdom is the teaching, and in teaching others, the virtue of elimination is the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a22_5']	「化他智斷俱為用」者，以自望他智斷俱為智，以他望自智斷俱為斷，文從以他望自而說，是故單云「化他智斷俱為用」也。	「化他智斷俱為用」者，以自望他智斷俱為智，以他望自智斷俱為斷，文從以他望自而說，是故單云「化他智斷俱為用」也。	002	As for the wisdom and severance of transforming others are both used, from the perspective of oneself, wisdom and severance are both wisdom; from the perspective of others, wisdom and severance are both severance. The text speaks from the perspective of others, therefore it simply says the wisdom and severance of transforming others are both used.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a23_3']	次總料簡五章者，前是料簡四章已竟。	次總料簡五章者，前是料簡四章已竟。	002	Next, the general analysis of the five chapters, the previous analysis of the four chapters is already complete.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a25_11']	從「問經經」去復似料簡教相，教相秖是分別四章，四章若異教相亦異，故云「經經各異」。	從「問經經」去復似料簡教相，教相秖是分別四章，四章若異教相亦異，故云「經經各異」。	002	From asking about the sutras of each sutra onwards, it again seems to analyze the characteristics of the teachings. The characteristics of the teachings are just the distinctions of the four chapters. If the four chapters are different, the characteristics of the teachings are also different, therefore it says each sutra is different.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a26_4', 'ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a27_3']	以教對四即是料簡五章故也。🔽若經經各立則名義俱別，故云得別失同；	以教對四即是料簡五章故也。 若經經各立則名義俱別，故云得別失同；	002	Using the teachings to correspond with the four is precisely the analysis of the five chapters.🔽If each sutra establishes its own, then both the name and meaning are distinct, therefore it says obtaining the distinct loses the same;
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829a27_19']	今名同義別，故云「得同不失別」。	今名同義別，故云「得同不失別」。	002	Now the name is the same but the meaning is distinct, therefore it says obtaining the same does not lose the distinct.
['ZH_T33_1717_002:0829b01_13']	觀心者，初示用觀處，七番共解已釋五章，會異居後今所未論，故總將第六觀心一章以消前五，令一一文俱入觀門。	觀心者，初示用觀處，七番共解已釋五章，會異居後今所未論，故總將第六觀心一章以消前五，令一一文俱入觀門。	002	As for contemplating the mind, the first shows the place of using contemplation, and the seven rounds of common understanding have already explained the five chapters. The reconciliation of differences is at the end and has not yet been discussed, so the sixth chapter on contemplating the mind is used to eliminate the previous five, making each text enter the contemplation gate.

It is like the five layers of profound meanings, with the name at the very beginning, crowning the entire text. Within the text, it does not discuss the three of essence, purpose, and function. The world is also at the beginning of the four siddhāntas. The three of giving rise to good and so forth do not go beyond the world. Therefore, they are the same.

['ZH_T33_1717_002:0830a21_4']	言「中觀」者，謂觀中之觀，名為中觀，故用所觀以申於體，能觀因果以申於宗，所以引《纓珞》助申論者，破立之義與用義同，利益眾生具須破立復同用也。	言「中觀」者，謂觀中之觀，名為中觀，故用所觀以申於體，能觀因果以申於宗，所以引《纓珞》助申論者，破立之義與用義同，利益眾生具須破立復同用也。	002	As for middle observation, it refers to the observation within the middle, which is called the middle observation. Therefore, the observed is used to explain the essence, and the cause and effect of the observation are used to explain the purport. The reason for citing the Sutra of the Jeweled Necklace to assist in explaining the treatise is that the meaning of refuting and establishing is the same as the meaning of using. The benefit of sentient beings must include refuting and establishing, which is also the same as using.
