Therefore it is said he ascended. It illustrates the gradual increase of his position. Not dwelling in the human realm, his position is revealed to be pure, so he resides in the heavens.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0626c07_4']	若天表淨，何獨妙高。	若天表淨，何獨妙高。	If the heavens illustrate purity, why is it only Mount Sumeru?

All grasses, trees, birds, and beasts, wherever they go, take on the same color as it, and their own color does not change.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0626c12_1']	四者德妙，謂八方猛風不能令動。	四者德妙，謂八方猛風不能令動。	Fourth, the virtues are wondrous, as the eight-sided fierce winds cannot move it.

['ZH_T35_1735_017:0626c17_8']	十堅固妙，於輪圍中最在後壞。	十堅固妙，於輪圍中最在後壞。	Tenth, the marvelous firmness is that it is the last to be destroyed by the outer ring of mountains.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0626c19_14']	高者，高八萬四千由旬，入水亦爾，下據金剛、上隣空界，頂上縱廣量亦如之，獨出九山故稱高也。	高者，高八萬四千由旬，入水亦爾，下據金剛、上隣空界，頂上縱廣量亦如之，獨出九山故稱高也。	As for its height, it is 84,000 yojanas high, and its roots enter the water the same distance. Below it rests on vajra, and above it borders the realm of space. The size of its peak is also the same. Because it stands alone above the nine mountains, it is called high.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0626c26_12']	十住之行亦復如是，聞思修解而為妙體，四德八聖以為妙相，四辯為色令物解同，雖同眾音自智不變，八法不動而為妙德，七支奉戒金山圍繞，七識流轉而為海印，第一義天依持而住，可以神會非情能升，不離本處遍應十方，映蔽佛口及菩薩月，而成涅槃生死晝夜，生教行果而為妙樹。	十住之行亦復如是，聞思修解而為妙體，四德八聖以為妙相，四辯為色令物解同，雖同眾音自智不變，八法不動而為妙德，七支奉戒金山圍繞，七識流轉而為海印，第一義天依持而住，可以神會非情能升，不離本處遍應十方，映蔽佛口及菩薩月，而成涅槃生死晝夜，生教行果而為妙樹。	The practices of the ten abodes are also like this. Hearing, thinking, and cultivation are the wondrous essence. The four virtues and eight holy ones are the wondrous characteristics. The four unobstructed abilities are the color that causes beings to understand the same. Although the same as the various sounds, one's own wisdom does not change. The eight dharmas are unmoving, which is the wondrous virtue. The seven branches of the precepts surround like a golden mountain. The seven consciousnesses flowing are the ocean seal. The ultimate truth heaven relies on and abides. It can be spiritually understood, not something the emotions can ascend to. Not leaving the original place, it universally responds to the ten directions. It outshines the Buddha's mouth and the bodhisattvas' moon. It forms nirvana and the day and night of birth and death. The teaching, practice, and fruition of birth are the wondrous tree.

['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a05_15']	四王處半旁而非正，表住不退異信輕毛，故越彼天居妙高頂。	四王處半旁而非正，表住不退異信輕毛，故越彼天居妙高頂。	The Four Heavenly Kings dwell halfway up the mountain, but not at the summit, symbolizing that the abodes are irreversible, unlike the light-tufted hair of faith. Therefore, one transcends the heavens and dwells on the peak of Mount Sumeru.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a07_3']	善財童子於妙峯山頂見德雲者，亦表斯位，彌顯有由。	善財童子於妙峯山頂見德雲者，亦表斯位，彌顯有由。	The fact that Sudhana saw Devaghoṣa on the summit of Mount Sumeru also illustrates this stage, further emphasizing the reasons for it.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a09_14']	然上所釋皆圓教意，故下〈發心品〉云「應知此人即與三世諸佛同等，與三世佛功德平等，得如來一身無量身。	然上所釋皆圓教意，故下〈發心品〉云「應知此人即與三世諸佛同等，與三世佛功德平等，得如來一身無量身。	However, the above explanations are all based on the perfect teaching. Therefore, the chapter on arousing the mind states: One should know that this person is the same as the buddhas of the three times, equal in merit to the buddhas of the three times, and attains the one body and innumerable bodies of the Tathāgata.

['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a15_12']	合本性淨，是四德寶而自莊嚴，斯則本覺如來升法須彌之頂。	合本性淨，是四德寶而自莊嚴，斯則本覺如來升法須彌之頂。	Combining with the fundamentally pure nature, this is the four virtues and treasures, adorning oneself, this is the originally enlightened Tathāgata ascending to the peak of the Dharma Mount Sumeru.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a16_16']	三宗趣者，先約會以十住行德為宗，攝位德果為趣。	三宗趣者，先約會以十住行德為宗，攝位德果為趣。	Third, the purport and intent: First, discussing in terms of the assembly, the intent of the ten abodes, practices, and virtues is the purport, encompassing the virtues and fruits of the stages is the intent.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a18_3']	二品，以嚴處請佛赴感為宗，根緣契合說法為趣。	二品，以嚴處請佛赴感為宗，根緣契合說法為趣。	Second, the two chapters take adorning the place and the Buddha responding to the invitation as the purport, the mutual accord of faculties and conditions and expounding the Dharma as the intent.

['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a22_7']	一是方便，謂前品化主赴機、後品助化讚佛，主伴圓備方演法故；	一是方便，謂前品化主赴機、後品助化讚佛，主伴圓備方演法故；	One is skillful means, referring to the host of transformations responding to capacities in the previous chapter and the praise of the Buddha by the assisting transformations in the later chapter. Only when the host and companions are complete can the Dharma be expounded.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a25_1']	二是所依，謂三天說法各有偈讚，欲顯三賢皆依佛智有差別故，離如來智無自體故，獨為方便甚抑讚詞。	二是所依，謂三天說法各有偈讚，欲顯三賢皆依佛智有差別故，離如來智無自體故，獨為方便甚抑讚詞。	The second is the basis, referring to the three heavens expounding the Dharma each with verses of praise. This is to show that the three sagely stages all rely on the Buddha's wisdom and have distinctions, because apart from the Tathāgata's wisdom they have no self-nature. The skillful means alone are greatly suppressed and praised.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0627a25_10']	行向二會同此科判。	行向二會同此科判。	The two assemblies of the stages of practice and progress are classified in the same way.

They all enter the hall at the same time, 7. The sounds of music stop simultaneously, 8. Each contemplates past causes, 9. They equally praise the Tathāgata, 10.

Abiding is the universal essence, and going is the responsive function. Response is the essence of response. Although ascending later, it is not apart from the previous.

['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629b27_13']	初五敘因佛光見多盛事，初一敘此品放光、次一敘前品請讚、餘三重敘此品。	初五敘因佛光見多盛事，初一敘此品放光、次一敘前品請讚、餘三重敘此品。	First, five verses recount many grand events seen due to the Buddha's light. The first verse recounts the light emitted in this chapter, the next verse recounts the request for praise in the previous chapter, and the remaining three verses recount this chapter again.

['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c04_9']	十頌分六：	十頌分六：	The ten verses are divided into six parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c05_11']	初二違理觀佛非見佛、次四了法真性真見佛。	初二違理觀佛非見佛、次四了法真性真見佛。	The first two verses, contemplating the Buddha contrary to principle, are not seeing the Buddha; the next four verses, understanding the true nature of dharmas, truly see the Buddha.

Because of the above not relying on the true, then grasping at characteristics goes against the truth, only seeing the net of afflictions bound to the prison of suffering, blind without the eye of wisdom, and not seeing the Dharma body of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c13_4']	然此遮取相故，假設長時，無有多劫，全不了義，以見如來增智慧故。	然此遮取相故，假設長時，無有多劫，全不了義，以見如來增智慧故。	However, this avoids grasping at characteristics, so hypothetically using a long time, without many kalpas, completely not understanding the meaning, because seeing the Tathāgata increases wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c13_17']	第二四偈，了法真性真見佛。	第二四偈，了法真性真見佛。	The second four verses clarify the true nature of phenomena and truly see the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c14_2']	於中二：	於中二：	Within this, there are two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c14_12']	前二真觀、後二真止。	前二真觀、後二真止。	The first two are true contemplation, and the latter two are true cessation.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c15_5']	前中，初二句空觀，緣生無性故；	前中，初二句空觀，緣生無性故；	Within the former, the first two lines are the contemplation of emptiness, because arising from conditions is without nature;
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c15_17']	次二句假觀，隨俗假名故；	次二句假觀，隨俗假名故；	The next two lines are the contemplation of conventionality, because following worldly conventions are provisional names;
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c17_6']	次二句中觀，由前生滅一切諸法即無性故，相體即是不生滅也。	次二句中觀，由前生滅一切諸法即無性故，相體即是不生滅也。	The next two lines are the middle contemplation, because all dharmas that arise and cease are without nature, therefore the essence of their characteristics is precisely non-arising and non-ceasing.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c18_18']	後二句觀益，諸法如即是佛如，無生滅佛體本常，觀稱於如則佛常現。	後二句觀益，諸法如即是佛如，無生滅佛體本常，觀稱於如則佛常現。	The latter two lines are the benefits of contemplation. The suchness of all dharmas is precisely the suchness of the Buddha. The essence of the Buddha, who is without arising and ceasing, is originally permanent. Contemplation that accords with suchness is precisely the constant manifestation of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c19_15']	況三觀一心，則佛之體用無不現矣。	況三觀一心，則佛之體用無不現矣。	How much more so when the three contemplations are practiced with one mind, then the essence and function of the Buddha will all be manifested.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c20_16']	後二真止中，以觀觀法能所紛動，故須寂之。	後二真止中，以觀觀法能所紛動，故須寂之。	Within the latter two true cessations, because the contemplation of dharmas through contemplation is a flurry of subject and object, therefore it must be stilled.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c21_4']	初句牒前法性；	初句牒前法性；	The first line summarizes the previous nature of dharmas;
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c21_11']	次句泯其能所。	次句泯其能所。	The next line obliterates subject and object.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c22_13']	法性本空，非觀之使空，故無所取，何有能見？	法性本空，非觀之使空，故無所取，何有能見？	The nature of dharmas is originally empty, not made empty by contemplation, therefore there is nothing to grasp, how can there be a grasper?
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c23_8']	次二句心冥性佛故，止絕思求。	次二句心冥性佛故，止絕思求。	The next two lines are about the mind merging with the nature of the Buddha, therefore ceasing and transcending thought and seeking.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c26_4']	又上來空以遣有、假以遣空，如則雙遣空假、形奪兩亡，若謂雙非還成戲論，故辨起心皆妄、絕念方真，念本自無斯絕亦滅。	又上來空以遣有、假以遣空，如則雙遣空假、形奪兩亡，若謂雙非還成戲論，故辨起心皆妄、絕念方真，念本自無斯絕亦滅。	Moreover, above emptiness is used to eliminate existence, and provisional positing is used to eliminate emptiness. Suchness is the double elimination of emptiness and provisional positing, and the mutual negation of the two is completely absent. If one says the double negation still constitutes frivolous discourse, therefore it is distinguished that all arising of thought is false, and only the cessation of thought is true. Thought is originally non-existent, and this cessation also perishes.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c27_1']	故《中論》云「如來寂滅相，分別有亦非。	故《中論》云「如來寂滅相，分別有亦非。	Therefore the Zhong lun says: The characteristics of the Tathagata's quiescent extinction, even the existence of discrimination is not.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c27_13']	如是性空中，思惟亦不可。	如是性空中，思惟亦不可。	In suchness, emptiness, even thought cannot be.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c27_19']	」用斯文也。	」用斯文也。	This is the use of this text.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c28_4']	後一顯觀益。	後一顯觀益。	The last line shows the benefits of contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c28_14']	心冥體性，惑何由生？	心冥體性，惑何由生？	The mind merges with the essence, how can delusion arise?
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0629c29_2']	亦含三止意也。	亦含三止意也。	It also contains the meaning of the three cessations.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a01_9']	又亦通結止觀，稱上而觀，見惑性空即同佛性，何能染哉？	又亦通結止觀，稱上而觀，見惑性空即同佛性，何能染哉？	Moreover, it also generally concludes cessation and contemplation. Contemplating in accordance with the above, seeing the empty nature of afflictions is the same as Buddha-nature, how can it be able to defile?
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a02_13']	第三一偈迷性中，上半取法、次句迷性、末句結過。	第三一偈迷性中，上半取法、次句迷性、末句結過。	In the third verse on delusion regarding the nature, the first half grasps at dharmas, the next line is delusion regarding the nature, and the last line concludes the faults.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a03_4']	第四一偈，佛即同法如。	第四一偈，佛即同法如。	In the fourth verse, the Buddha is the same as the dharma-nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a05_1']	謂同空法故離三世，同假法故相具足，同雙遣故無住無著，同如體故遍不動搖。	謂同空法故離三世，同假法故相具足，同雙遣故無住無著，同如體故遍不動搖。	That is to say, because it is the same as the Dharma of emptiness, it is free from the three times; because it is the same as provisional phenomena, its characteristics are complete; because it is the same as the double negation, it has no abode and no attachment; because it is the same as the essence of thusness, it is universally unmoving.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a05_19']	第五一偈引己中，此親自證，希眾無惑。	第五一偈引己中，此親自證，希眾無惑。	The fifth verse, I myself have personally realized this, is to encourage the assembly to be free from doubt.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a06_14']	第六一偈推功有本者，非師心也。	第六一偈推功有本者，非師心也。	The sixth verse, Ascribing the merit to the source, is not to be self-centered.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a07_16']	亦謙己推人，異乎凡情，令法鉤鎖殊塗同致。	亦謙己推人，異乎凡情，令法鉤鎖殊塗同致。	It also humbles oneself and ascribes it to others, differing from ordinary emotions, causing the Dharma hook to lead to the same destination on different paths.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a08_2']	下八準之。	下八準之。	The following eight verses are based on this.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a09_6']	第三西方勝慧，以解佛勝智，隨空心淨，故以為名。	第三西方勝慧，以解佛勝智，隨空心淨，故以為名。	Third, the Western Superior Wisdom, using the Buddha's superior wisdom to follow the pure mind of emptiness, is therefore named.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a10_11']	頌意為顯欲令菩薩智慧明了，即大智了如及佛性故。	頌意為顯欲令菩薩智慧明了，即大智了如及佛性故。	The meaning of the verse is to manifest and cause bodhisattvas to have clear wisdom, because they understand thusness and buddha-nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a10_16']	十頌分四：	十頌分四：	The ten verses are divided into four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a12_9']	初一讚智為迷悟本、次四正顯迷悟、次四喻前得失、後一推功有在。	初一讚智為迷悟本、次四正顯迷悟、次四喻前得失、後一推功有在。	The first verse praises wisdom as the basis for delusion and enlightenment, the next four verses正顯迷悟, the next four verses喻前得失, and the last verse ascribes the merit to the source.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a13_9']	今初，由難思故，迷難則容有，思者故有悟。	今初，由難思故，迷難則容有，思者故有悟。	First, because of inconceivability, those who are confused may have it, while those who contemplate it may have realization.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a14_3']	次四迷悟中，初二迷、後二悟。	次四迷悟中，初二迷、後二悟。	Next, in the four on confusion and realization, the first two are confusion and the latter two are realization.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a15_6']	迷中，初一心外取境生想違理，故不能見無相之佛。	迷中，初一心外取境生想違理，故不能見無相之佛。	In confusion, the first is externally grasping objects and giving rise to thoughts that contradict principle, thus being unable to see the Buddha of no characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a16_5']	後偈取蘊內相、不了蘊性，故不見心佛。	後偈取蘊內相、不了蘊性，故不見心佛。	The latter verse grasps the internal characteristics of the aggregates and does not understand the nature of the aggregates, thus not seeing the Buddha of the mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a16_18']	亦是愚法小乘，故名無知者。	亦是愚法小乘，故名無知者。	It is also the foolish dharma of the lesser vehicle, thus called the ignorant one.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a17_14']	後二迷中，前明倒想，內外俱妄；	後二迷中，前明倒想，內外俱妄；	In the latter two confusions, the former clarifies inverted thoughts, both internal and external being false;
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a18_4']	今有了因，內外皆悟。	今有了因，內外皆悟。	Now, with the cause of understanding, both internal and external are realized.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a20_6']	初偈翻前外取，謂了一切法即心自性，性亦非性，情破理現則見舍那，稱於法性無內外也。	初偈翻前外取，謂了一切法即心自性，性亦非性，情破理現則見舍那，稱於法性無內外也。	The first verse overturns the previous external grasping, meaning understanding all dharmas as the self-nature of the mind, and the nature is also not a nature. When emotions are destroyed and principle manifests, one sees Mahāvairocana, in accordance with the nature of dharmas, without internal or external.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a22_2']	後偈翻前內取，了蘊性相，則見自心之佛，與盧舍那非一非異，故難思議。	後偈翻前內取，了蘊性相，則見自心之佛，與盧舍那非一非異，故難思議。	The latter verse overturns the previous internal grasping, understanding the nature and characteristics of the aggregates, then seeing the Buddha of one's own mind, which is neither the same as nor different from Mahāvairocana, thus being difficult to conceive.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a22_12']	然此一偈，文含多意：	然此一偈，文含多意：	However, this single verse contains many meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a23_13']	一但是蘊縛無有我人，則破前凡夫取我相也；	一但是蘊縛無有我人，則破前凡夫取我相也；	First, it only shows that the aggregates are bound and there is no self or person, thus refuting the previous ordinary beings' grasping at the characteristics of self;
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a24_14']	二前後因依相續無性，則破凡小取法相也。	二前後因依相續無性，則破凡小取法相也。	Second, the continuity of causes and conditions before and after is without nature, thus refuting the ordinary beings' and lesser vehicles' grasping at the characteristics of dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a25_13']	此性即第一義空，第一義空即是佛性。	此性即第一義空，第一義空即是佛性。	This nature is precisely the emptiness of ultimate truth, and the emptiness of ultimate truth is precisely buddha-nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a26_6']	又上性無所有，正因性也。	又上性無所有，正因性也。	Moreover, the above nature is non-existent is the nature of the correct cause.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a26_16']	前解此了，皆了因性。	前解此了，皆了因性。	The previous understanding of this is all the nature of the illuminating cause.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a27_9']	此蘊相續，即是正因，亦名生因。	此蘊相續，即是正因，亦名生因。	This continuity of the aggregates is precisely the correct cause, and is also called the generative cause.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a28_6']	言正因者，是中道義，中道即是佛性。	言正因者，是中道義，中道即是佛性。	As for the correct cause, it is the meaning of the middle way, and the middle way is precisely buddha-nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630a29_16']	謂現在陰滅、中陰陰生，是現在陰終不變為中陰五陰，故現陰非常。	謂現在陰滅、中陰陰生，是現在陰終不變為中陰五陰，故現陰非常。	It refers to the cessation of the present aggregates and the arising of the intermediate state aggregates. The present aggregates will never transform into the intermediate state five aggregates, thus the present aggregates are not permanent.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630b01_17']	如種生牙，種不至牙，雖不至牙而能生牙。	如種生牙，種不至牙，雖不至牙而能生牙。	It is like a seed producing a sprout. The seed does not reach the sprout. Although it does not reach the sprout, it can produce the sprout.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630b03_1']	此現在陰雖不至後，而能生後，則現陰非斷。	此現在陰雖不至後，而能生後，則現陰非斷。	This present aggregate does not reach the future, but it can produce the future, thus the present aggregate is not annihilated.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630b04_6']	而中陰五陰亦非自生、不從餘來，因現五陰生中陰陰。	而中陰五陰亦非自生、不從餘來，因現五陰生中陰陰。	The five aggregates of the intermediate state are also not born from themselves, nor do they come from elsewhere. They are born from the present five aggregates, giving rise to the five aggregates of the intermediate state.
['ZH_T35_1735_017:0630b05_2']	斯則後陰非無因，故後陰非常；	斯則後陰非無因，故後陰非常；	This means that the subsequent aggregates are not without a cause, and therefore the subsequent aggregates are not permanent;

As for investigating the seeing to have a basis, it means that because the Buddha speaks of the one path of purity, he is able to dispel existence.
