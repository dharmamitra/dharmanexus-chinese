['ZH_T12_0376_005:0882c17_8']	若使是苦名苦諦者，地獄畜生皆有苦諦。	若使是苦名苦諦者，地獄畜生皆有苦諦。	If suffering is called the truth of suffering, then hell and animal realms both have the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0882c18_7']	名苦諦者，謂知如來常住法身非穢食身。	名苦諦者，謂知如來常住法身非穢食身。	As for the truth of suffering, it means knowing that the Tathāgata abides in the Dharma body, not the defiled food body.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0882c20_5']	眾生不得如來尊智，知苦故以非法為法，久遠癡愛煩惱結縛，彌劫生死苦輪常轉。	眾生不得如來尊智，知苦故以非法為法，久遠癡愛煩惱結縛，彌劫生死苦輪常轉。	Because sentient beings do not attain the Tathāgata's supreme wisdom and know suffering, they take what is not the Dharma to be the Dharma, and for a long time are bound by the afflictions of delusion and craving, constantly turning the wheel of suffering through births and deaths for eons.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0882c21_17']	假使如來常住二字暫經耳者，欲生天上及求解脫，必得聖果自然快樂。	假使如來常住二字暫經耳者，欲生天上及求解脫，必得聖果自然快樂。	Even if the two characters 'Tathāgata abides' temporarily pass through the ears, if one wishes to be born in the heavens or seek liberation, one will surely attain the holy fruit and naturally experience bliss.

For a long time in the past, they did not know the Tathāgata's eternal teaching, and thus they have gone through immeasurable births and deaths, suffering and delusion. Knowing suffering in this way is knowing the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0882c25_6']	若異此者非知苦諦。	若異此者非知苦諦。	If it is different from this, it is not knowing the truth of suffering.

The true Dharma then perishes. Because of ignorance, they remain in birth and death for a long time, revolving in the suffering of delusion. One should know that such people destroy the true Dharma and will never attain the fruit of rebirth in the heavens or liberation.

The retribution for false speech will also cause them to suffer in birth and death for a long time. Knowing in this way is knowing the truth of the accumulation of suffering.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0883a02_11']	若異此者不名知集。	若異此者不名知集。	If it is different from this, it is not called knowing the accumulation of suffering.

['ZH_T12_0376_005:0883a07_18']	當知一切皆有如來常住之性，滅諸結縛煩惱永盡，顯現如來常住之性，起於一心便得妙果，常樂自在名法自在王，是為修行苦滅聖諦。	當知一切皆有如來常住之性，滅諸結縛煩惱永盡，顯現如來常住之性，起於一心便得妙果，常樂自在名法自在王，是為修行苦滅聖諦。	One should know that all possess the nature of the Tathāgata's permanence. Destroying the bonds and afflictions, and completely extinguishing them, manifests the nature of the Tathāgata's permanence. Arousing a single thought, one attains the wonderful fruit, eternally blissful and sovereign, called the Dharma Sovereign. This is the cultivation of the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.

['ZH_T12_0376_005:0883a11_14']	是如來性因故，如是知者為知如來平等滅諦。	是如來性因故，如是知者為知如來平等滅諦。	Because this is the nature of the Tathāgata. Knowing it in this way is knowing the Tathāgata's truth of cessation, which is equal for all.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0883a12_4']	若異此者不名知滅。	若異此者不名知滅。	If it is different from this, it is not called knowing cessation.

['ZH_T12_0376_005:0883a14_7']	於四種法不知實故，長處生死無量苦惑。	於四種法不知實故，長處生死無量苦惑。	Because one does not truly understand these four dharmas, one remains in birth and death for immeasurable eons, deluded by suffering.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0883a16_19']	於生死中能勤修行，了知如來法僧解脫，是常住法，非變易法非磨滅法，不盡不壞，起於一心得微妙果快樂自在。	於生死中能勤修行，了知如來法僧解脫，是常住法，非變易法非磨滅法，不盡不壞，起於一心得微妙果快樂自在。	In the midst of birth and death, one is able to diligently practice and understand that the Tathāgata, the Dharma, the Saṃgha, and liberation are the dharmas of permanence, not subject to change, not subject to destruction, not exhausted, and not decaying. By giving rise to a single thought, one attains the subtle fruits of happiness and freedom.
['ZH_T12_0376_005:0883a18_5']	於此常住不空四法作非法想者，當知是輩得邪見果報。	於此常住不空四法作非法想者，當知是輩得邪見果報。	Those who regard these four dharmas of permanence and non-emptiness as non-dharmas will attain the fruits and retributions of wrong views.
