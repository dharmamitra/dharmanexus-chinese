['ZH_T32_1633_001:0028c25_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0028c25_11']	汝稱我言說無道理；	汝稱我言說無道理；	You say my words are illogical;
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0028c26_4']	若如此者，汝言說亦無道理。	若如此者，汝言說亦無道理。	If so, your words are also illogical.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0028c27_1']	若汝言說無道理，我言說則有道理。	若汝言說無道理，我言說則有道理。	If your words are illogical, then my words are logical.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0028c28_3']	若汝言說有道理，稱我言說無道理者，是義不然。	若汝言說有道理，稱我言說無道理者，是義不然。	If your words are logical but you say my words are illogical, this is unreasonable.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0028c29_5']	復次無道理者自體中有道理，是故無有無道理。	復次無道理者自體中有道理，是故無有無道理。	Moreover, illogicality itself contains logic, therefore there is no such thing as illogicality.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a01_16']	若自體中無道理者，無道理亦應無，是故汝說我無道理，是義不然。	若自體中無道理者，無道理亦應無，是故汝說我無道理，是義不然。	If there is no logic in itself, illogicality should also be nonexistent. Therefore your claim that I am illogical is unreasonable.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a02_13']	又若汝稱我言說無道理，自顯汝無智。	又若汝稱我言說無道理，自顯汝無智。	Furthermore, if you say my words are illogical, it reveals your lack of wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a02_17']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a03_18']	無道理者則無所有，言說者與無道理為一為異？	無道理者則無所有，言說者與無道理為一為異？	That which is unreasonable does not exist. Is speech the same as or different from the unreasonable?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a04_19']	若一者，言說亦無，汝云何稱我言說無道理？	若一者，言說亦無，汝云何稱我言說無道理？	If the same, then speech also does not exist. How can you say my speech is unreasonable?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a06_3']	若異者，言說有道理，汝復何故稱我言說無道理耶？	若異者，言說有道理，汝復何故稱我言說無道理耶？	If different, then speech is reasonable. Why do you say my speech is unreasonable?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a06_12']	復次言說自相破故。	復次言說自相破故。	Moreover, speech itself is contradictory.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a07_11']	汝難言說共我言說，為同時、為不同時？	汝難言說共我言說，為同時、為不同時？	Do you say that your criticism of speech is simultaneous with my speech or not simultaneous?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a08_17']	同時者，則不能破我言說，譬如牛角馬耳同時生故不能相破。	同時者，則不能破我言說，譬如牛角馬耳同時生故不能相破。	If simultaneous, it cannot refute my speech, just as the horns of an ox and the ears of a horse cannot refute each other because they are born simultaneously.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a10_2']	若不同者，汝難在前、我言在後，我言未出汝何所難？	若不同者，汝難在前、我言在後，我言未出汝何所難？	If not simultaneous, your criticism is before and my speech is after. Before my speech comes out, what do you criticize?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a10_8']	是故不成難。	是故不成難。	Therefore, it is not a criticism.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a11_8']	若我言在前、汝難在後，我言已成，復何所難？	若我言在前、汝難在後，我言已成，復何所難？	If my speech is before and your criticism is after, my speech is already established. What more is there to criticize?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a13_4']	若同時者，我言汝難是難是可難不可分別，譬如江水海水同時和合不可分別。	若同時者，我言汝難是難是可難不可分別，譬如江水海水同時和合不可分別。	If they are simultaneous, I say your objection is an objection that can be objected to, but cannot be distinguished, just like the Ganges water and ocean water mixing together simultaneously and being indistinguishable.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a13_18']	又汝難為難自義、為不難自義？	又汝難為難自義、為不難自義？	Moreover, does your objection object to your own meaning or not object to your own meaning?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a14_13']	若難自義，自義自壞，我言自成。	若難自義，自義自壞，我言自成。	If it objects to your own meaning, your own meaning is self-contradictory, and my statement is self-established.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a15_4']	若不難自義，難則不成就。	若不難自義，難則不成就。	If it does not object to your own meaning, the objection is not established.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a15_8']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a15_18']	於自義中不成就難故。	於自義中不成就難故。	Because the objection is not established within your own meaning.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a16_13']	若成就者，自義則壞、他義則成。	若成就者，自義則壞、他義則成。	If it were established, your own meaning would be destroyed and the other's meaning would be established.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a18_14']	復次汝稱我言說無道理者，非是言說，若是言說不得無道理，有言說、無道理，此二相違。	復次汝稱我言說無道理者，非是言說，若是言說不得無道理，有言說、無道理，此二相違。	Furthermore, you call my statement unreasonable, but it is not a statement. If it is a statement, it cannot be unreasonable. A statement and unreasonableness are mutually contradictory.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a19_9']	譬如童女有兒，若是童女，不得有兒；	譬如童女有兒，若是童女，不得有兒；	For example, a virgin having a child. If she is a virgin, she cannot have a child;
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a19_18']	若有兒，則非童女。	若有兒，則非童女。	if she has a child, she is not a virgin.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a21_2']	童女、有兒此二相違，是故稱有言說無道理，是義不然。	童女、有兒此二相違，是故稱有言說無道理，是義不然。	The characteristics of a virgin and having a child are mutually contradictory. Therefore, to say that there is speech but it is unreasonable is not correct.

['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a23_7']	證智力大，汝言則壞。	證智力大，汝言則壞。	The power of the knowledge of realization is great, and your words are destroyed.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a24_12']	譬如有人說聲不為耳識得，耳識既得聲，為證智所成就。	譬如有人說聲不為耳識得，耳識既得聲，為證智所成就。	It is like someone saying that sound is not obtained by the ear consciousness, but since the ear consciousness does indeed obtain sound, it is accomplished by the knowledge of realization.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a25_2']	證智力大，此言則壞。	證智力大，此言則壞。	The power of the knowledge of realization is great, and this statement is destroyed.

['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a26_19']	若無道理，言說亦無；	若無道理，言說亦無；	If it is unreasonable, then speech also does not exist;
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a27_9']	若有言說，知有道理。	若有言說，知有道理。	if there is speech, then one knows that it is reasonable.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a28_3']	譬如有人說聲常住，從因生故。	譬如有人說聲常住，從因生故。	It is like someone saying that sound is permanent because it arises from causes.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a29_8']	一切從因生者則無常住，譬如瓦器從因生故不得常住。	一切從因生者則無常住，譬如瓦器從因生故不得常住。	Everything that arises from causes is impermanent, like a clay pot, which does not remain permanent because it arises from causes.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029a29_19']	聲若從因生，不得常住；	聲若從因生，不得常住；	If sound arises from causes, it cannot be permanent;
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b01_10']	若常住者，不得從因生。	若常住者，不得從因生。	if it is permanent, it cannot arise from causes.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b02_1']	無常住者，比智所成就。	無常住者，比智所成就。	The impermanent is accomplished by inferential cognition.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b02_11']	比智力大，常住則壞。	比智力大，常住則壞。	Inferential cognition is powerful, and permanence is destroyed.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b04_2']	有道理者，若有言說則有道理，有道理者比智所成就，無道理者則壞。	有道理者，若有言說則有道理，有道理者比智所成就，無道理者則壞。	That which is reasonable, if there is speech, then there is reason. That which is reasonable is accomplished by inferential cognition, and that which is unreasonable is destroyed.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b04_11']	復次與世間相違故。	復次與世間相違故。	Furthermore, because it contradicts worldly convention.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b05_9']	汝稱我言說無道理，是語與世間相違。	汝稱我言說無道理，是語與世間相違。	You say my speech is unreasonable, but this statement contradicts worldly convention.

['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b08_10']	相待道理者，如長短父子。	相待道理者，如長短父子。	The reason of mutual dependence is like long and short, father and son.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b09_4']	成就道理者，如五分言成就義。	成就道理者，如五分言成就義。	The reason of accomplishment is like the accomplishment of meaning in the five-part speech.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b09_14']	如如道理者，有三種：	如如道理者，有三種：	The reason of suchness is of three kinds:
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b10_11']	一無我如如、二無常如如、三寂靜如如。	一無我如如、二無常如如、三寂靜如如。	First, the suchness of no-self, second, the suchness of impermanence, and third, the suchness of quiescence.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b12_7']	於世間中言說為果、道理為因，世間中若見果則知有因，若見言說則知有道理。	於世間中言說為果、道理為因，世間中若見果則知有因，若見言說則知有道理。	In the world, speech is the effect, and reasoning is the cause. In the world, if one sees the effect, one knows there is a cause. If one sees speech, one knows there is reasoning.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b13_5']	汝稱我言說無道理，是義與世間相違。	汝稱我言說無道理，是義與世間相違。	You say my speech has no reasoning, this meaning contradicts the world.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b13_19']	若有言說無道理者，無有是處。	若有言說無道理者，無有是處。	If there is speech without reasoning, there is no such place.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b15_10']	汝稱我言說異，不相應故，我今共汝辯決是處，若人說異則有過失。	汝稱我言說異，不相應故，我今共汝辯決是處，若人說異則有過失。	You say my speech is different, because it is not appropriate. I now debate with you to decide this point. If a person says different, then there is a fault.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b16_15']	汝自立義與我義異，則是自說則是異說，是故汝得過失。	汝自立義與我義異，則是自說則是異說，是故汝得過失。	You establish your own meaning as different from my meaning, then it is your own saying, then it is a different saying, therefore you incur the fault.

['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b18_19']	若不異，汝則同我，則無有異，汝說我異，此是邪語。	若不異，汝則同我，則無有異，汝說我異，此是邪語。	If it is not different, then you are the same as me, then there is no difference. You say I am different, this is wrong speech.
['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b19_11']	復次異與異無異，是故無異。	復次異與異無異，是故無異。	Moreover, difference and difference are not different, therefore there is no difference.

['ZH_T32_1633_001:0029b26_4']	若汝說不說異者，我亦說不說異。	若汝說不說異者，我亦說不說異。	If you say difference is not said, then I also say difference is not said.
