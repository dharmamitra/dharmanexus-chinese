['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b04_9']	一開義、二融合。	一開義、二融合。	007	1. Opening up the meaning, and 2. Merging and integrating.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b04_20']	初中真、應，各有二義。	初中真、應，各有二義。	007	In the first, the true and the responsive each have two meanings.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b06_1']	真中，一不變義，謂雖現化而常湛然，初句顯之；	真中，一不變義，謂雖現化而常湛然，初句顯之；	007	In the true, the first is the meaning of immutability, which means that although manifestations appear, they are always tranquil and still. The first sentence reveals this.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b07_5']	二隨緣義，謂不守自性無不現應，故云亦非非化。	二隨緣義，謂不守自性無不現應，故云亦非非化。	007	The second is the meaning of following conditions, which means not clinging to one's own nature and manifesting in response to all. Therefore, it says also not not transformation.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b08_10']	二化中，一無體即空義，謂攬緣無性，故云諸法無化；	二化中，一無體即空義，謂攬緣無性，故云諸法無化；	007	In the second, the first is the meaning of having no substance and being empty, which means embracing conditions without essence. Therefore, it says all dharmas have no transformation.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b09_5']	二從緣幻有義，故云示現有化。	二從緣幻有義，故云示現有化。	007	The second is the meaning of illusory existence arising from conditions, and therefore it says manifesting as having transformation.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b09_13']	二融合，亦二義：	二融合，亦二義：	007	Second, merging and integrating also has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b10_1']	一別合、二通融。	一別合、二通融。	007	1. Separate combination, and 2. Universal merging and integrating.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b11_14']	初中，由真中隨緣則不變故，是故亦真亦不真、非真不非真，名為真法身。	初中，由真中隨緣則不變故，是故亦真亦不真、非真不非真，名為真法身。	007	In the first, because the true follows conditions, it is immutable. Therefore, it is both true and not true, neither true nor not true, and is called the true Dharma body.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b13_3']	化中，體空則幻有故，是故亦化亦不化、非化非不化，名為佛化身。	化中，體空則幻有故，是故亦化亦不化、非化非不化，名為佛化身。	007	In transformation, the essence is empty, yet illusory existence is still present, therefore it is both transformation and non-transformation, neither transformation nor non-transformation, and is called the Buddha's transformation body.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b15_7']	二通融，謂由真不變，顯化體空，此是真不無、化不有，以為法身不無化用，以有化中空義故。	二通融，謂由真不變，顯化體空，此是真不無、化不有，以為法身不無化用，以有化中空義故。	007	Second, the comprehensive fusion, which means that due to the unchanging true nature, the empty essence of transformation is revealed. This is the true nature not being nonexistent, and the transformation not being existent, forming the Dharma body not being nonexistent with transformative function, because there is the meaning of emptiness within transformation.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b17_8']	又由真隨緣，顯化幻有，此是化不無、真不有，以為化身不無真理，以有真中隨緣義故。	又由真隨緣，顯化幻有，此是化不無、真不有，以為化身不無真理，以有真中隨緣義故。	007	Moreover, due to the true nature following conditions, the illusory existence of transformation is revealed. This is the transformation not being nonexistent, and the true nature not being existent, forming the transformation body not being nonexistent with true reality, because there is the meaning of following conditions within the true nature.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b20_6']	又由隨緣幻有不異不變體空故，是故現化紛然未甞不寂、真性湛然無曾不化，真化鎔融為一無礙清淨法界，思之可見。	又由隨緣幻有不異不變體空故，是故現化紛然未甞不寂、真性湛然無曾不化，真化鎔融為一無礙清淨法界，思之可見。	007	Moreover, due to the non-difference between the illusory existence that follows conditions and the empty essence that does not change, therefore the manifested transformation is in disorder yet never not tranquil, and the true nature is tranquil yet never not transforming. The true and the transformed merge into one unobstructed pure Dharma realm. This can be seen through contemplation.

['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b28_11']	一一身圓廣，故云十方見；	一一身圓廣，故云十方見；	007	First, each body is perfect and vast, so it is said that the ten directions see it;
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240b29_5']	二一身則一切，故云見一切佛；	二一身則一切，故云見一切佛；	007	Second, one body is all, so it is said that one sees all Buddhas;
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240c01_1']	三明此用未曾暫歇，故云常見；	三明此用未曾暫歇，故云常見；	007	Third, it clarifies that this function has never ceased for a moment, so it is said that one always sees;
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240c01_16']	四顯此用未曾不寂，故云無來處；	四顯此用未曾不寂，故云無來處；	007	Fourth, it reveals that this function has never been without quiescence, so it is said that there is no place it comes from;
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240c02_11']	五彰所說復深，故云法亦無著。	五彰所說復深，故云法亦無著。	007	Fifth, it shows that what is spoken is also profound, so it is said that the Dharma is also without attachment.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0240c05_10']	下明德無窮內，謂前所現一切之身，彼一一身各攝法界無盡之德，是故於不思劫說彼一身之德尚不可盡，況餘一切之身。	下明德無窮內，謂前所現一切之身，彼一一身各攝法界無盡之德，是故於不思劫說彼一身之德尚不可盡，況餘一切之身。	007	Below, it clarifies that the virtues are inexhaustible within. It means that all the bodies manifested before each encompass the inexhaustible virtues of the Dharma realm. Therefore, even if one were to speak of the virtues of a single body for inconceivable eons, it would still be impossible to exhaust them, let alone the virtues of all the other bodies.

['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c13_19']	一約菩提心有三心故，《起信論》云「菩提心有三：	一約菩提心有三心故，《起信論》云「菩提心有三：	007	First, based on the three kinds of bodhicitta, the Awakening of Faith says: There are three kinds of bodhicitta:
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c14_9']	一直心，正念真如法故；	一直心，正念真如法故；	007	First, the mind of right mindfulness, because it correctly contemplates true suchness;

['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c17_1']	」二約成菩薩三聚戒故，謂律儀離過，向實際也；	」二約成菩薩三聚戒故，謂律儀離過，向實際也；	007	Second, it is because it accomplishes the bodhisattva's three collections of precepts. That is to say, the precepts of restraint are to leave behind faults and head towards reality;
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c17_11']	攝善廣修，向菩提也；	攝善廣修，向菩提也；	007	the collection of good dharmas is to cultivate extensively and head towards enlightenment;
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c18_1']	攝生大悲，向眾生也。	攝生大悲，向眾生也。	007	the collection of benefiting beings is great compassion and heads towards sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c19_8']	是故《法集經》云「若菩薩捨於三聚迴向之心，菩薩不應共住。	是故《法集經》云「若菩薩捨於三聚迴向之心，菩薩不應共住。	007	Therefore, the Dharma Collection Sutra says, If a bodhisattva abandons the mind of dedication towards the three collections, bodhisattvas should not dwell together with them.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c20_10']	」三約成二行，實際向護煩惱行，餘二護二乘行。	」三約成二行，實際向護煩惱行，餘二護二乘行。	007	Third, it is because it accomplishes two practices. Heading towards reality is the practice of guarding against afflictions, while the other two are the practices of guarding against the two vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c21_15']	四成二利行，向實自利、向眾生利他、向菩提通二利。	四成二利行，向實自利、向眾生利他、向菩提通二利。	007	Fourth, it accomplishes the two kinds of benefiting practices.

Due to the three practices in the causal stage, the result is the three virtues. Heading towards reality is the virtue of cessation, heading towards enlightenment is the virtue of wisdom, and heading towards sentient beings is the virtue of kindness. The three bodies can be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c26_7']	六約成悲智，智中照理顯事分二，故有三也。	六約成悲智，智中照理顯事分二，故有三也。	007	Sixth, in terms of accomplishing compassion and wisdom. In wisdom, illuminating principle and manifesting phenomena are divided into two, thus there are three.
['ZH_T35_1733_007:0243c26_19']	七唯約悲，謂何故向菩提？	七唯約悲，謂何故向菩提？	007	Seventh, only in terms of compassion. Why does one head towards enlightenment?
