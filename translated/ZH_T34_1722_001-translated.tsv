['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633b15_2']	蓋聞無上調御一切種智，內鏡三明、外流七辨，蓄莫限之質、適無方之化，並皆會道無匪稱機。	蓋聞無上調御一切種智，內鏡三明、外流七辨，蓄莫限之質、適無方之化，並皆會道無匪稱機。	001	I have heard that the unsurpassed tamer, the one with omniscience, internally mirrors the three insights and externally flows with the seven abilities. Accumulating limitless substance, adapting to transformations in all directions, all of which are in accord with the Way and not apart from responding to capacities.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633b18_5']	至如《妙法蓮華經》者，斯乃窮理盡性之格言、究竟無餘之極說，理致淵遠，統群典之要，文旨婉麗，窮巧妙之談，三聖之所揄揚，四依之所頂戴。	至如《妙法蓮華經》者，斯乃窮理盡性之格言、究竟無餘之極說，理致淵遠，統群典之要，文旨婉麗，窮巧妙之談，三聖之所揄揚，四依之所頂戴。	001	As for the Lotus Sūtra, this is the exemplary saying that exhausts the principle and completes the nature, the ultimate teaching that leaves nothing remaining. The principle is profoundly distant, encompassing the essentials of all scriptures. The meaning of the text is elegant, exhausting the discussion of skillful subtlety. It is praised by the three sages and revered by the four types of followers.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633b21_9']	昔仙人薗內未曜此摩尼，今靈鷲山中方灑茲甘露，良以小志前開故早馳羊鹿，大心後發方駕此白牛，斯實薩埵之明訓、道場之玄軌也。	昔仙人薗內未曜此摩尼，今靈鷲山中方灑茲甘露，良以小志前開故早馳羊鹿，大心後發方駕此白牛，斯實薩埵之明訓、道場之玄軌也。	001	In the past, within the garden of the sage, this maṇi was not yet illuminated. Now, on Vulture Peak, it is about to sprinkle this sweet dew. It is because the small aspiration was opened earlier, so the sheep and deer carts were driven early. The great mind was aroused later, and only then did it drive this white ox cart. This is truly the clear instruction of the bodhisattva and the profound track of the site of enlightenment.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633b26_16']	皆是吾子等賜大車，既知止息同到寶所，謂乘真實也。	皆是吾子等賜大車，既知止息同到寶所，謂乘真實也。	001	All are my sons, equally bestowing the great vehicle. Knowing to rest and together arriving at the treasure site - this is called riding the true means.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633b28_2']	燃燈授記、伽耶成道、王宮誕生、雙林唱滅，謂身方便也；	燃燈授記、伽耶成道、王宮誕生、雙林唱滅，謂身方便也；	001	Receiving the prediction from Dīpaṃkara, attaining enlightenment at Gayā, being born in the royal palace, proclaiming extinction at the twin trees - this is called the provisional body;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633b29_19']	逸多不見其始，窮學莫惻其終，六趣無以攝其生，力負無以化其體，謂身真實也。	逸多不見其始，窮學莫惻其終，六趣無以攝其生，力負無以化其體，謂身真實也。	001	Viśvāmitra does not see its beginning, those who study to the end cannot fathom its end. The six destinies cannot encompass its birth, and no power can transform its substance - this is called the true body.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633c01_11']	兩門既為方便，所以言麁；	兩門既為方便，所以言麁；	001	Since the two gates are provisional means, therefore they are called coarse;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0633c02_4']	二種並云真實，故目之為妙。	二種並云真實，故目之為妙。	001	Since the two kinds are both called true, therefore they are called wonderful.

It is made a standard for beings and is called Dharma. The Way is profound beyond form and is metaphorically called lotus flower. As for sūtra, it subtly reveals the speechless and tranquil extinction, which has not changed from ancient times to the present. Its essence can be examined and touched, and thus it is called a sūtra.

Now, in order to speak the practices of the bodhisattvas for the bodhisattvas who turn from the Lesser Vehicle to enter the Great Vehicle, this sūtra is expounded.

For such people, I will now also enable them to hear this sutra and enter the Buddha's wisdom. Since it is called first seeing my body, it refers to seeing Vairocana Buddha at the site of nirvana. Hearing what I say refers to the teachings of the Flower Garland. Therefore, we know that from the past, it was for the sake of those of direct progress that the practices of bodhisattvas were expounded.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a02_11']	「除前脩習學小乘者」，則知爾前未為二乘說菩薩行。	「除前脩習學小乘者」，則知爾前未為二乘說菩薩行。	001	Except for those who have previously cultivated and studied the Lesser Vehicle, we know that before that time, the practices of bodhisattvas were not expounded for the Two Vehicles.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a08_6']	直往之人久行佛道福德利根，是故前為；	直往之人久行佛道福德利根，是故前為；	001	The people who go straight [to enlightenment] have practiced the Buddha's path for a long time, have merit and sharp faculties, therefore it is for them first;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a09_7']	迴小入大之人不行佛道薄福鈍根，是故後為。	迴小入大之人不行佛道薄福鈍根，是故後為。	001	The people who have turned from the Lesser Vehicle to enter the Great Vehicle have not practiced the Buddha's path, have little merit and dull faculties, therefore it is for them later.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a11_8']	故〈方便品〉云「有佛子心淨柔軟亦利根，無量諸佛所而行深妙道，為此諸佛子說是大乘經」；	故〈方便品〉云「有佛子心淨柔軟亦利根，無量諸佛所而行深妙道，為此諸佛子說是大乘經」；	001	Therefore, the chapter on skillful means says: There are Buddha's disciples whose minds are pure and gentle, and who also have sharp faculties. In the presence of innumerable Buddhas, they have practiced the profound and wonderful path. For the sake of these Buddha's disciples, the Buddha expounds this Mahayana sutra.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a13_21']	「鈍根樂小乘法、貪著於生死，於諸無量佛不行深妙道，眾苦所惱亂，為是說涅槃」，乃至「今正是其時，決定說大乘」。	「鈍根樂小乘法、貪著於生死，於諸無量佛不行深妙道，眾苦所惱亂，為是說涅槃」，乃至「今正是其時，決定說大乘」。	001	Those with dull faculties delight in the Lesser Vehicle, are attached to birth and death, do not practice the profound and wondrous path under innumerable Buddhas, are troubled by various sufferings, for whom I teach nirvāṇa, up to Now is the right time to definitively teach the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a15_5']	故知菩薩利根先聞大道，聲聞淺劣後入佛慧，明既其證也。	故知菩薩利根先聞大道，聲聞淺劣後入佛慧，明既其證也。	001	Therefore, we know that bodhisattvas with sharp faculties first hear the great path, while śrāvakas with shallow and inferior faculties later enter the Buddha's wisdom. This is clearly their realization.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a15_18']	二者、欲受梵王請故說是經。	二者、欲受梵王請故說是經。	001	Second, it is because he wishes to accept the Brahma King's request that he expounds this sūtra.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a17_5']	答：	答：	001	The answer:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a17_15', 'ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a18_18']	請有二時，酬亦兩種。🔽請二時者，初請說一乘根本法輪，後請說三乘枝末之教。	請有二時，酬亦兩種。 請二時者，初請說一乘根本法輪，後請說三乘枝末之教。	001	There are two times for requesting, and the response is also of two kinds.🔽The two times for requesting are first requesting to expound the fundamental Dharma wheel of the One Vehicle, and later requesting to expound the branch teachings of the Three Vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a20_12']	酬亦二時者，自昔已來受請說三乘之教，今方得酬其請說一乘根本法輪。	酬亦二時者，自昔已來受請說三乘之教，今方得酬其請說一乘根本法輪。	001	The two times for responding are that from the past up to now, he has accepted the request to expound the teachings of the Three Vehicles, and now he has just begun to respond to the request to expound the fundamental Dharma wheel of the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a22_1']	是故今明受請與昔為異，具如〈方便品〉及《智度論》初卷說也。	是故今明受請與昔為異，具如〈方便品〉及《智度論》初卷說也。	001	Therefore, the explanation of accepting the invitation now is different from the past, as is explained in the Skillful Means Chapter and the first fascicle of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a23_7']	三者、欲明十方三世諸佛權實二智互相資成故說此經。	三者、欲明十方三世諸佛權實二智互相資成故說此經。	001	Third, it is to clarify that the two wisdoms of expedient and true of the Buddhas of the ten directions and three periods mutually assist each other in forming this sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a24_8']	然諸佛之心未曾權之與實，豈是一之與三？	然諸佛之心未曾權之與實，豈是一之與三？	001	However, the mind of the Buddhas has never been expedient or true, how could it be one or three?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a26_2']	故內外並冥、緣觀俱寂，但於無名相中假名相說，欲出處眾生故，強稱權實。	故內外並冥、緣觀俱寂，但於無名相中假名相說，欲出處眾生故，強稱權實。	001	Therefore, the inner and outer are both merged, and the conditions and contemplation are both tranquil. It is only in the nameless and formless that names and forms are provisionally spoken, in order to deliver sentient beings, and so it is forcefully called expedient and true.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a28_20']	則於互有相資成故，非實無以辨權、非權無以辨實，實有起權之功、權有資實之用，是以文云「於一佛乘分別說三」，謂從實起權；	則於互有相資成故，非實無以辨權、非權無以辨實，實有起權之功、權有資實之用，是以文云「於一佛乘分別說三」，謂從實起權；	001	Then, in the mutual existence, they assist each other in forming. Without the true, the expedient cannot be distinguished; without the expedient, the true cannot be distinguished. The true has the function of giving rise to the expedient, and the expedient has the use of assisting the true. Therefore, the text says, In the Buddha's vehicle, I distinguish and speak of three, which means giving rise to the expedient from the true;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634a29_17']	「我設是方便令得入佛慧」則以權通實。	「我設是方便令得入佛慧」則以權通實。	001	I set up this expedient to enable them to enter the Buddha's wisdom uses the expedient to penetrate the true.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b03_1']	執權喪實者，自昔已來執三乘教人不能悟入一實者也。	執權喪實者，自昔已來執三乘教人不能悟入一實者也。	001	Those who cling to the provisional and lose the real are those who have adhered to the teachings of the Three Vehicles since ancient times and are unable to awaken to the One Reality.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b04_17']	執實喪權者，謂稟《法花》一乘菩薩既聞道理唯一無有三乘，遂守其理一失於三用。	執實喪權者，謂稟《法花》一乘菩薩既聞道理唯一無有三乘，遂守其理一失於三用。	001	Those who cling to the real and lose the provisional are the bodhisattvas who receive the teaching of the One Vehicle of the Lotus Sutra. Having heard that the principle is only one and there are not three vehicles, they then adhere to the principle of oneness and lose the three practices.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b06_18']	如《法花論》釋〈藥草喻品〉「為破菩薩病故來，雖一地所生、一雨所潤，而諸草木各有差別」。	如《法花論》釋〈藥草喻品〉「為破菩薩病故來，雖一地所生、一雨所潤，而諸草木各有差別」。	001	As the Fahua Lun (Treatise on the Lotus Sutra) explains in the chapter on the Parable of the Herbs, It comes to break the bodhisattvas' illness. Although they are born from the same ground and moistened by the same rain, the various grasses and trees have their own distinctions.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b07_18']	此明理雖是一隨緣有三，豈可守一而失三用耶？	此明理雖是一隨緣有三，豈可守一而失三用耶？	001	This clarifies that although the principle is one, it follows conditions to be three. How can one adhere to oneness and lose the three practices?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b10_14']	然昔稟三乘教人既喪於實亦復失權，執一乘教人既其失權亦復喪實，故此二人皆失如來權實二智，並住顛倒虛妄斷常。	然昔稟三乘教人既喪於實亦復失權，執一乘教人既其失權亦復喪實，故此二人皆失如來權實二智，並住顛倒虛妄斷常。	001	However, those who have received the teachings of the Three Vehicles since ancient times have already lost the real and also lost the provisional. Those who adhere to the teachings of the One Vehicle have already lost the provisional and also lost the real. Therefore, these two groups have both lost the Tathāgata's wisdom of the provisional and the real, and both abide in inverted, false views of annihilation and permanence.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b16_12']	然眾生本性寂滅未曾垢淨，雖非垢淨，於眾生顛倒是故成垢，但此垢重眾生不可頓拔，故諸佛菩薩漸漸出之，所以開三淨之教：	然眾生本性寂滅未曾垢淨，雖非垢淨，於眾生顛倒是故成垢，但此垢重眾生不可頓拔，故諸佛菩薩漸漸出之，所以開三淨之教：	001	However, the fundamental nature of sentient beings is quiescent extinction and has never been defiled or pure. Although it is neither defiled nor pure, it becomes defiled due to the errors of sentient beings. But because these defilements are heavy, sentient beings cannot be suddenly liberated, therefore buddhas and bodhisattvas gradually remove them. Therefore they open the teaching of three purities:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b17_5']	一者以五戒十善淨於三塗；	一者以五戒十善淨於三塗；	001	First, using the five precepts and ten wholesome [acts] to purify the three evil paths;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b17_14']	次說二乘以淨三界；	次說二乘以淨三界；	001	Next, teaching the two vehicles to purify the three realms;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b18_5']	後明一道以淨二乘。	後明一道以淨二乘。	001	Later, clarifying the one path to purify the two vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b19_15']	以三塗為重苦，三界為中苦，變易為下苦，故說三門以淨其三垢。	以三塗為重苦，三界為中苦，變易為下苦，故說三門以淨其三垢。	001	Taking the three evil paths as heavy suffering, the three realms as middling suffering, and the changes as lesser suffering, therefore three gates are spoken to purify the three defilements.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b20_12']	三垢既滅則三淨亦忘，故說此經也。	三垢既滅則三淨亦忘，故說此經也。	001	Since the three defilements are extinguished, the three purities are also forgotten. Therefore this sūtra is spoken.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b22_17']	然說三淨為止三垢，垢若不留淨亦便息，了悟諸法本性寂然未曾垢淨，乃入於佛慧直至道場也。	然說三淨為止三垢，垢若不留淨亦便息，了悟諸法本性寂然未曾垢淨，乃入於佛慧直至道場也。	001	However, it is said that the three purities stop the three defilements. If the defilements do not remain, the purities also cease. Fully understanding that the inherent nature of all dharmas is originally tranquil, never defiled or pure, one then enters the Buddha's wisdom and goes straight to the site of enlightenment.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b24_8']	總談群聖垂教凡有三門：	總談群聖垂教凡有三門：	001	In general, the teachings of the sages can be summarized into three methods:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b25_11']	一、攝邪歸正門，二、攝異歸同門，三、攝因歸果門。	一、攝邪歸正門，二、攝異歸同門，三、攝因歸果門。	001	1. The method of subsuming heterodoxy and returning to orthodoxy, 2. The method of subsuming differences and returning to sameness, 3. The method of subsuming causes and returning to fruition.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b26_8']	攝邪歸正門者，釋迦未出之前凡有二邪：	攝邪歸正門者，釋迦未出之前凡有二邪：	001	As for the method of subsuming heterodoxy and returning to orthodoxy, before Shakyamuni appeared in the world, there were generally two kinds of heterodoxy:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b27_5']	一、在家起愛眾生，二、出家諸見外道；	一、在家起愛眾生，二、出家諸見外道；	001	1. Sentient beings who give rise to attachment while staying at home, 2. Renunciant non-Buddhists with various views;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b27_16']	此二並乖正道故稱為邪。	此二並乖正道故稱為邪。	001	These two deviate from the right path, so they are called heterodox.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634b29_2']	故〈方便品〉云「以諸欲因緣備受諸苦毒」，即起愛之流也；	故〈方便品〉云「以諸欲因緣備受諸苦毒」，即起愛之流也；	001	Therefore, the chapter on skillful means says, Because of various desires, one experiences all kinds of suffering and harm, which refers to those who give rise to attachment.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c01_1']	「入邪見稠林若有若無等」，謂諸外道也。	「入邪見稠林若有若無等」，謂諸外道也。	001	Entering the dense forest of wrong views, such as existence and non-existence, etc., refers to various non-Buddhist paths.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c02_16']	乃至〈譬喻品〉云起愛譬彼毒虫，諸見喻同惡鬼，如來出世攝彼二邪歸五乘之正。	乃至〈譬喻品〉云起愛譬彼毒虫，諸見喻同惡鬼，如來出世攝彼二邪歸五乘之正。	001	Up to the Parable Chapter, which says that giving rise to craving is like a poisonous insect, and various views are the same as evil ghosts. The Tathāgata appears in the world to gather these two evils and return them to the right of the five vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c03_18']	此二人中有無聞非法者，以人天善根而成就之；	此二人中有無聞非法者，以人天善根而成就之；	001	Among these two kinds of people, there are those who have never heard the Dharma and are not suitable for it. They are accomplished through the wholesome roots of humans and gods;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c04_15']	有三乘根性者，以三乘法而攝取之。	有三乘根性者，以三乘法而攝取之。	001	There are those with the aptitude for the three vehicles, who are gathered and accepted through the Dharma of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c05_7']	故攝彼二邪歸五乘正也。	故攝彼二邪歸五乘正也。	001	Therefore, they gather those two evils and return them to the right of the five vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c07_4']	二、攝異歸同門者，若稟教之徒聞昔三乘而頓悟一道者，不須復更說法花之教；	二、攝異歸同門者，若稟教之徒聞昔三乘而頓悟一道者，不須復更說法花之教；	001	Second, the gate of gathering differences and returning to sameness means that if those who receive the teaching hear the three vehicles of the past and suddenly realize the one path, they do not need to be further taught the Dharma Flower Sutra;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c09_1']	但鈍根之流雖捨二邪更對執五異，今欲攝茲五異同歸一乘，謂攝異歸同門也。	但鈍根之流雖捨二邪更對執五異，今欲攝茲五異同歸一乘，謂攝異歸同門也。	001	But for those with dull faculties, although they abandon the two evils, they still cling to the five differences. Now, wanting to gather these five differences and return them to the one vehicle, is the gate of gathering differences and returning to sameness.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c11_9']	三、攝因歸果門者，攝前五異同歸一乘但是因行，今為欲令修因證果故說如來真應兩身，謂攝因歸果門。	三、攝因歸果門者，攝前五異同歸一乘但是因行，今為欲令修因證果故說如來真應兩身，謂攝因歸果門。	001	Third, the gate of subsuming causes and returning to fruition. The previous five differences are subsumed and return to the One Vehicle, which is merely the practice of causes. Now, in order to cause the cultivation of causes and the realization of fruition, the true and response bodies of the Tathāgata are spoken of. This is called the gate of subsuming causes and returning to fruition.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c12_12']	《法花》之前但有初門，斯經既融會一化則具足三門。	《法花》之前但有初門，斯經既融會一化則具足三門。	001	Before the Lotus Sūtra, there was only the first gate. Since this sūtra has merged the One Teaching, it is fully endowed with the three gates.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c14_14']	然明此三門，意欲為通寂滅無言之道，令玄悟之賓體斯妙極未曾邪正，乃至豈是因果耶？	然明此三門，意欲為通寂滅無言之道，令玄悟之賓體斯妙極未曾邪正，乃至豈是因果耶？	001	However, the intention of clarifying these three gates is to universally transmit the path of quiescent extinction and speechlessness, causing the guests of profound understanding to realize this wondrous ultimate, which has never been biased or correct, up to whether it is causes and effects.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0634c16_4']	故此三門無教不收、無理不攝、如空之含萬像、若海之納百川。	故此三門無教不收、無理不攝、如空之含萬像、若海之納百川。	001	Therefore, these three gates include all teachings and subsume all principles, like the sky containing myriad forms, or like the ocean containing a hundred rivers.

Since there are not even five, there are also not not-five. The inherent nature is tranquil and does not rely on anything, which is called the Middle Way. The Middle Way is precisely the Wonderful Dharma.

Those who contemplate the Buddha with a mind attached to objects are actually contemplating what is attached to objects and not the Buddha.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a08_15']	又若執應身不一、法身不二者，亦未免二見、有所得心，即是不動而應十方現前，既不動而應、雖應常寂，故此應身則是法身。	又若執應身不一、法身不二者，亦未免二見、有所得心，即是不動而應十方現前，既不動而應、雖應常寂，故此應身則是法身。	001	Moreover, if one grasps the responsive bodies as not one and the Dharma body as not two, one still cannot avoid the two views and the mind of attainment, which is precisely not moving while responding to the ten directions and manifesting in the present. Since one does not move while responding, although responding, one always abides in quiescence. Therefore, this responsive body is precisely the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a10_18']	如《涅槃》云「吾今此身則是法身常寂而應」，不失應身故不二而二，開於本迹二而不二，未始二身。	如《涅槃》云「吾今此身則是法身常寂而應」，不失應身故不二而二，開於本迹二而不二，未始二身。	001	As the Nirvana Sutra says, This body of mine is precisely the Dharma body, always quiescent while responding, not losing the responsive body, therefore not two while two. Opening the two of essence and trace, yet not two, never before two bodies.

Being unborn and undying is called the Dharma body, and expediently proclaiming extinction is called the responsive function.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a14_13']	若復言法身自不生不滅、應身自生滅，還成生滅無生滅二見。	若復言法身自不生不滅、應身自生滅，還成生滅無生滅二見。	001	If it is said again that the Dharma body itself is unborn and undying, and the responsive body itself is born and perishes, it would still constitute the two views of perishing and not perishing.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a15_14']	雙樹唱滅，滅而不失。	雙樹唱滅，滅而不失。	001	Proclaiming extinction under the twin trees is perishing without being lost.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a17_4']	故生滅宛然未曾起謝，生滅宛然故是應用，未曾起謝稱為法身。	故生滅宛然未曾起謝，生滅宛然故是應用，未曾起謝稱為法身。	001	Therefore, arising and perishing are evident, yet never arising or passing away. Because arising and perishing are evident, it is the responsive function. Being called the Dharma body means never arising or passing away.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a18_3']	三者、過去久成佛、未來不滅，稱為法身。	三者、過去久成佛、未來不滅，稱為法身。	001	Third, attaining Buddhahood long ago in the past and not perishing in the future is called the Dharma body.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a22_6']	所以然者，悟本悟於法身，法身既無久近故，則知悟亦無久近。	所以然者，悟本悟於法身，法身既無久近故，則知悟亦無久近。	001	The reason for this is that enlightenment is the enlightenment of the Dharma body. Since the Dharma body has no long or short, it should be known that enlightenment also has no long or short.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a24_16']	若爾，釋迦久悟而實無久，當知今近悟亦無有近，故知遠悟亦無有遠，故知近遠無二，不二而二，不失古今也。	若爾，釋迦久悟而實無久，當知今近悟亦無有近，故知遠悟亦無有遠，故知近遠無二，不二而二，不失古今也。	001	If it is so, then Śākyamuni's long enlightenment is actually not long. It should be known that the recent enlightenment now is also not recent. Therefore, it should be known that distant enlightenment is also not distant.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a25_9']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a27_7']	就釋迦應身，必備此三，初則法身不二、迹身不一，未知不二之身為有生滅為無生滅？	就釋迦應身，必備此三，初則法身不二、迹身不一，未知不二之身為有生滅為無生滅？	001	In terms of Śākyamuni's response body, it must be equipped with these three. First, the Dharma body is not two, and the trace body is not one. It is not yet known whether the non-dual body has arising and ceasing or not arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a28_3']	故次明法身無生滅、應身有生滅。	故次明法身無生滅、應身有生滅。	001	Therefore, the next clarifies that the Dharma body has no arising and ceasing, while the response body has arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636a29_13']	雖明法身無生滅、應身有生滅，未知釋迦為始證法身、為久證法身？	雖明法身無生滅、應身有生滅，未知釋迦為始證法身、為久證法身？	001	Although it clarifies that the Dharma body has no arising and ceasing, while the response body has arising and ceasing, it is not yet known whether Śākyamuni initially realized the Dharma body or realized it for a long time.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b01_2']	故第三次明久近。	故第三次明久近。	001	Therefore, the third is next to clarify the long and recent.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b02_2']	一切諸佛多具前二義，釋迦則具足有三句。	一切諸佛多具前二義，釋迦則具足有三句。	001	All buddhas mostly possess the first two meanings, while Śākyamuni fully possesses all three phrases.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b02_4']	問：	問：	001	Question:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b02_13']	三身云何辨於權實？	三身云何辨於權實？	001	How are the three bodies distinguished in terms of provisional and real?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b02_15']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b03_16']	法身但實而非權，化身但權而非實，應身有二句：	法身但實而非權，化身但權而非實，應身有二句：	001	The dharma body is only real and not provisional, while the transformation body is only provisional and not real. The response body has two phrases:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b06_17']	一者內與法身相應名為應身，法身既常故應身亦常，此即應身是實而非權，故《涅槃經》云「諸佛所師所謂法也，以法常故諸佛亦常」；	一者內與法身相應名為應身，法身既常故應身亦常，此即應身是實而非權，故《涅槃經》云「諸佛所師所謂法也，以法常故諸佛亦常」；	001	First, internally corresponding with the dharma body is called the response body. Since the dharma body is eternal, the response body is also eternal. This response body is real and not provisional. Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, The teacher of all buddhas is the Dharma. Because the Dharma is eternal, the buddhas are also eternal.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b10_7']	二者外與大機相應淨土成佛故名應身，此之應身是權而非實，故七卷《金光明》云「應化兩身是假名有，非是真實，念念生滅故名曰無常」，則其證也。	二者外與大機相應淨土成佛故名應身，此之應身是權而非實，故七卷《金光明》云「應化兩身是假名有，非是真實，念念生滅故名曰無常」，則其證也。	001	Second, externally corresponding with the great opportunity and manifesting the pure land and becoming a buddha is called the response body. This response body is provisional and not real. Therefore, the seven-fascicle Golden Light Sutra says, The two bodies of response and transformation are nominally existent, not truly existent. Because they arise and cease moment by moment, they are called impermanent. This is the evidence.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b11_6']	既識三義即便識佛，故今念佛三昧倍復增益。	既識三義即便識佛，故今念佛三昧倍復增益。	001	Having recognized these three meanings, one immediately recognizes the Buddha, so now the samādhi of mindfulness of the Buddha increases even more.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b11_16']	又合此三種以為二義：	又合此三種以為二義：	001	Furthermore, these three kinds are combined into two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b13_1']	前之二義以明身之權實，後之一義以明壽之權實。	前之二義以明身之權實，後之一義以明壽之權實。	001	The first two meanings clarify the provisional and real of the body, and the last one meaning clarifies the provisional and real of lifespan.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b15_2']	《涅槃經》亦明長壽與金剛身，所以但明此二者，眾生唯有形與壽命，隨順之亦明斯二也。	《涅槃經》亦明長壽與金剛身，所以但明此二者，眾生唯有形與壽命，隨順之亦明斯二也。	001	The Nirvana Sutra also clarifies long life and the vajra body. The reason it only clarifies these two is because sentient beings only have form and lifespan, and in accordance with them, it also clarifies these two.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b15_4']	問：	問：	001	Question:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b15_15']	《大品》云「云何念佛？	《大品》云「云何念佛？	001	The Large Sutra says, What is mindfulness of the Buddha?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b16_7']	以無憶故」，既其無憶，云何念也？	以無憶故」，既其無憶，云何念也？	001	Because there is no recollection. Since there is no recollection, how can there be mindfulness?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b16_9']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b18_10']	了眾生與佛本來不二，即不見佛為所念、眾生為能念，故內外並忘緣觀俱寂，故名無憶也。	了眾生與佛本來不二，即不見佛為所念、眾生為能念，故內外並忘緣觀俱寂，故名無憶也。	001	Realizing that sentient beings and Buddhas are originally non-dual, one does not see the Buddha as the object of mindfulness or sentient beings as the subject of mindfulness. Therefore, both internal and external are forgotten, and both the object and subject of meditation are tranquil. This is called no recollection.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b18_12']	問：	問：	001	Question:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b19_9']	《大品》可有斯文，今經何處明斯念佛也？	《大品》可有斯文，今經何處明斯念佛也？	001	The Large Sutra may have this text, but where in the present sutra is this mindfulness of the Buddha clarified?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b19_11']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b22_6']	〈壽量品〉云「如來如實知見三界之相，無有生死若退若出，亦無在世及滅度者，非實非虛非如非異，不如三界見於三界」。	〈壽量品〉云「如來如實知見三界之相，無有生死若退若出，亦無在世及滅度者，非實非虛非如非異，不如三界見於三界」。	001	The Chapter on Life Span states: The Tathāgata truly knows and sees the characteristics of the three realms, which have no birth and death, no regression or emergence, no existence in the world or attainment of nirvana, are neither real nor false, neither as they appear nor different, and are not seen in the three realms as the three realms.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b23_11']	三界即是眾生，故知眾生與佛無二，寧有能念所念義耶？	三界即是眾生，故知眾生與佛無二，寧有能念所念義耶？	001	Since the three realms are precisely sentient beings, we know that sentient beings and buddhas are non-dual. How can there be the meaning of one who recollects and that which is recollected?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b24_7']	故《中論》云「生死、涅槃無有二際」。	故《中論》云「生死、涅槃無有二際」。	001	Therefore, the Zhong lun says: Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa have no two ends.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b24_17']	眾生、法身義亦如是。	眾生、法身義亦如是。	001	The meaning of sentient beings and the Dharma body is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b25_11']	斯即經論大宗，必須依斯禮念也。	斯即經論大宗，必須依斯禮念也。	001	This is precisely the great purport of the sūtras and treatises. One must rely on this for paying homage and recollecting.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b27_2']	十者、欲為現在未來十方眾生如實分別罪福果報，故說是經。	十者、欲為現在未來十方眾生如實分別罪福果報，故說是經。	001	Tenth, in order to truly distinguish the fruits of sin and merit for sentient beings in the ten directions of the present and future, this sūtra is expounded.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b28_1']	如一言毀法及謗持經人，則獲廣大罪報；	如一言毀法及謗持經人，則獲廣大罪報；	001	As one word of slander against the Dharma or denigration of the person who upholds the sūtra will result in vast and grave consequences;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636b28_12']	一念隨喜則招無邊之福。	一念隨喜則招無邊之福。	001	A single thought of sympathetic joy will bring forth boundless blessings.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c01_7']	所以然者，夫論罪福從乖符理生，此經既說實理，故信之福多、毀呰之罪重。	所以然者，夫論罪福從乖符理生，此經既說實理，故信之福多、毀呰之罪重。	001	The reason for this is that when discussing sin and merit, they arise from deviating from or conforming to principle. Since this sutra expounds the true principle, the merit of believing in it is great, and the sin of slandering it is heavy.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c02_8']	一舊疏本明說經因緣甚廣，今略明十門也。	一舊疏本明說經因緣甚廣，今略明十門也。	001	One old commentary clearly explains the causes and conditions of expounding the sutra in great detail, but now I will briefly explain it in ten aspects.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c04_9']	第二、明宗旨門者，自古至今明宗旨與體，或言是一、或言是有異。	第二、明宗旨門者，自古至今明宗旨與體，或言是一、或言是有異。	001	The second, clarifying the main purport, from ancient times to the present, those who clarify the main purport and essence, some say they are the same, some say there are differences.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c07_17']	言其異者，以教為體、以理為宗，故《涅槃》釋七善文云「知法知義」，知法者謂十二部經，知義者謂教所表理，故以能表之教以為經體，所表之理用以為經宗。	言其異者，以教為體、以理為宗，故《涅槃》釋七善文云「知法知義」，知法者謂十二部經，知義者謂教所表理，故以能表之教以為經體，所表之理用以為經宗。	001	Those who say there are differences consider the teachings to be the essence and the principles to be the main purport. Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra explains the seven good texts, saying knowing the Dharma and knowing the meaning. Knowing the Dharma refers to the twelve divisions of the scriptures, and knowing the meaning refers to the principles manifested by the teachings. Therefore, the teachings that can manifest are taken as the essence of the sutra, and the principles that are manifested are used as the main purport of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c09_10']	言宗體一者，所表之理既是理宗旨，能詮之文還詮宗旨，故宗體不二。	言宗體一者，所表之理既是理宗旨，能詮之文還詮宗旨，故宗體不二。	001	Those who say the main purport and essence are the same consider that since the principles that are manifested are the main purport of the principles, the texts that can expound them still expound the main purport. Therefore, the main purport and essence are not two.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c10_12']	今明一之與異隨時用之，貴在得悟，義無定也。	今明一之與異隨時用之，貴在得悟，義無定也。	001	Now, I clarify that oneness and difference are used according to the time, the precious thing is in attaining enlightenment, the meaning is not fixed.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c12_2']	昔在會稽，撰釋法華宗旨凡有十三家，今略明即世盛行，有其三說：	昔在會稽，撰釋法華宗旨凡有十三家，今略明即世盛行，有其三說：	001	In the past, in Kuaiji, I compiled the main points of the Lotus Sutra, which had thirteen schools. Now I briefly clarify the three main teachings that are prevalent in the world:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c12_14']	一云以萬善之因為此經宗。	一云以萬善之因為此經宗。	001	The first says that the cause of myriad good deeds is the main point of this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c15_12']	所以然者，斯經文雖有七軸而宗歸一乘，是者即因也，故乘以運出為義，運載行人從因至果，至果則更無進趣，是故非乘。	所以然者，斯經文雖有七軸而宗歸一乘，是者即因也，故乘以運出為義，運載行人從因至果，至果則更無進趣，是故非乘。	001	The reason for this is that although the text of this sutra has seven scrolls, the main point returns to the One Vehicle, which is the cause. Therefore, the meaning of the vehicle is to transport out, transporting the practitioner from the cause to the fruition. When reaching the fruition, there is no further progress, so it is not the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c17_18']	如《大品》云「是乘從三界出，到薩波若中住」，《智度論》釋此語云「乘到菩提變名種智」，故知以因為乘。	如《大品》云「是乘從三界出，到薩波若中住」，《智度論》釋此語云「乘到菩提變名種智」，故知以因為乘。	001	As the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, This vehicle goes out from the three realms and reaches the state of sarvajña. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra explains this saying, The vehicle reaches bodhi and is transformed into the name of universal wisdom. Therefore, we know that the cause is the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c19_3']	《勝鬘經》云「於佛果上更無說一乘法事」，故則知果非乘矣。	《勝鬘經》云「於佛果上更無說一乘法事」，故則知果非乘矣。	001	The Śrīmālā-sūtra says, There is no further teaching of the One Vehicle Dharma above the Buddha's fruition, so we know that the fruition is not the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c19_5']	問：	問：	001	Question:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c20_7']	此經初分明因門、後分辯果門，云何偏以因乘為宗？	此經初分明因門、後分辯果門，云何偏以因乘為宗？	001	The first part of this sutra clarifies the gate of causes, and the latter part discusses the gate of effects. Why is it biased towards taking the cause vehicle as the main point?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c20_9']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c22_1']	後章辯果為成前因，以行一乘之因得壽量之果，故舉果成因、以因為宗。	後章辯果為成前因，以行一乘之因得壽量之果，故舉果成因、以因為宗。	001	The latter chapter discusses effects in order to establish the previous causes. By practicing the cause of the One Vehicle, one attains the effect of the lifespan. Therefore, the effect is used to establish the cause, and the cause is taken as the main point.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c22_14']	二者有人言，此經以果為宗。	二者有人言，此經以果為宗。	001	Second, some say that this sutra takes the effect as its main point.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0636c28_16']	所以然者，夫欲識經宗宜觀經題，題云妙法者謂如來靈智為體也，陶冶塵滓眾塵斯盡故名為妙，動為物作軌即所以稱法，自因位以來麁法未盡，不得稱為妙，既以果德為妙法，即以果德為經宗，是以釋迦以玄音始唱歎佛智甚深，多寶讚善稱大惠平等，即其證也。	所以然者，夫欲識經宗宜觀經題，題云妙法者謂如來靈智為體也，陶冶塵滓眾塵斯盡故名為妙，動為物作軌即所以稱法，自因位以來麁法未盡，不得稱為妙，既以果德為妙法，即以果德為經宗，是以釋迦以玄音始唱歎佛智甚深，多寶讚善稱大惠平等，即其證也。	001	The reason for this is that if one wants to understand the main point of the sutra, one should observe the title of the sutra. The title says Wonderful Dharma, which refers to the enlightened wisdom of the Tathagata as its essence. It refines away the impurities of the dust, and all the dust is exhausted, thus it is called wonderful. It moves to make a model for beings, and this is why it is called Dharma. From the stage of causes and below, the coarse Dharma has not yet been exhausted, and it cannot be called wonderful. Since the wonderful Dharma is taken as the effect virtues, it is taken as the main point of the sutra. Therefore, Shakyamuni began by chanting the profound sound, praising the Buddha's wisdom as being very deep. Prabhutaratna praised it as good, calling it the great wisdom that is equal. This is the evidence.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a03_8']	三有人言，此經具以一乘因果為宗，故初分明一乘之因，後章明一乘之果，借蓮花為喻者，此花不有而已，有即花實俱含，此經不說而已，說即有因果雙辨也。	三有人言，此經具以一乘因果為宗，故初分明一乘之因，後章明一乘之果，借蓮花為喻者，此花不有而已，有即花實俱含，此經不說而已，說即有因果雙辨也。	001	Third, some people say that this sutra takes the cause and effect of the One Vehicle as its main theme. Therefore, the first chapter clearly explains the cause of the One Vehicle, and the later chapters explain the fruit of the One Vehicle. Borrowing the lotus flower as a metaphor, this flower does not exist, but once it exists, the flower and its fruit are both contained. This sutra does not speak, but once it speaks, it explains both cause and effect.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a07_1']	言破而不取者，今不與舊同亦不與舊異。	言破而不取者，今不與舊同亦不與舊異。	001	As for refuting but not accepting, now it is neither the same as the old [interpretations] nor different from the old [interpretations].
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a08_8']	所以然者，求上來義不成，或不可與其同、或不可與其異。	所以然者，求上來義不成，或不可與其同、或不可與其異。	001	The reason for this is that seeking the meaning above is not established, and it cannot be the same as them or different from them.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a09_4']	求上諸義既不可得，與誰論同異耶？	求上諸義既不可得，與誰論同異耶？	001	Since the meaning above cannot be obtained by seeking, with whom can one discuss sameness and difference?

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a12_13']	今略題數門示不成相：	今略題數門示不成相：	001	Now, I briefly list several gates to show the aspect of non-establishment:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a14_6']	三師既以萬善為因、壽量為果，為萬行因內有壽量之果、為無果耶？	三師既以萬善為因、壽量為果，為萬行因內有壽量之果、為無果耶？	001	Since the three teachers take myriad wholesome deeds as the cause and longevity as the effect, is there the effect of longevity within the cause of myriad practices or is there no effect?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a15_6']	如若其有果，即因無生果之能，果無酬因之用。	如若其有果，即因無生果之能，果無酬因之用。	001	If there is the effect, then the cause has no ability to produce the effect, and the effect has no function of repaying the cause.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a16_7']	若萬行之因無壽量之果，雖修萬行終不生果；	若萬行之因無壽量之果，雖修萬行終不生果；	001	If the cause of myriad practices has no effect of longevity, then even if one cultivates myriad practices, the effect will never arise;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a17_10']	若萬行因無果而生果者，萬惡亦無佛果應生佛果。	若萬行因無果而生果者，萬惡亦無佛果應生佛果。	001	If the cause of myriad practices has no effect but gives rise to the effect, then myriad evils also have no Buddha effect and should give rise to the Buddha effect.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637a20_8']	又《大品經》云「若言因中有果、因中無果、亦有亦無、非有非無，如是之人即謗佛法僧繫屬於魔，是魔眷屬」，豈是一乘因果義耶？	又《大品經》云「若言因中有果、因中無果、亦有亦無、非有非無，如是之人即謗佛法僧繫屬於魔，是魔眷屬」，豈是一乘因果義耶？	001	Moreover, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, If one says that cause has effect, cause has no effect, both has and has not, neither has nor has not, such a person slanders the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha and is bound to Māra, a follower of Māra.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637b18_1']	一、初開宗即云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著」，二者、後〈流通〉富樓那歎佛云「甚奇世尊以智惠方便拔出眾生處處貪著」，處處貪著者著小著大、著三著一，故知此經正明無所得也。	一、初開宗即云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著」，二者、後〈流通〉富樓那歎佛云「甚奇世尊以智惠方便拔出眾生處處貪著」，處處貪著者著小著大、著三著一，故知此經正明無所得也。	001	First, at the beginning it says, I use countless skillful means to guide sentient beings to be free from all attachments. Second, in the final chapter, Pūrṇa praises the Buddha, saying, It is truly amazing, World-Honored One, that with your wisdom and skillful means you pull out sentient beings from all their attachments. All attachments refers to attachment to the small, attachment to the great, attachment to the three, and attachment to the one. Therefore, we know that this sūtra clearly explains non-attainment.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637b21_2', 'ZH_T34_1722_001:0637b22_19']	又此經盛談寂滅，如云「是法不可示言辭相寂滅」，又云「諸法從本來常自寂滅相」，寂滅相即是無得實相異名，不應言此經辨有所得也。🔽三者、則用此經文責之，若言乘是因者，是義不然，今講《法花》宜以《法花》為證。	又此經盛談寂滅，如云「是法不可示言辭相寂滅」，又云「諸法從本來常自寂滅相」，寂滅相即是無得實相異名，不應言此經辨有所得也。🔽三者、則用此經文責之，若言乘是因者，是義不然，今講《法花》宜以《法花》為證。	001	Moreover, this sūtra extensively discusses cessation, as it says, This Dharma cannot be shown, its verbal characteristics are extinguished, and also says, All dharmas from the beginning are always characterized by cessation. The characteristic of cessation is another name for the true characteristic of non-attainment, and one should not say that this sūtra explains attainment.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c01_7']	《法花》明三車一車皆悉是果，故〈譬喻品〉云「今此三車皆是在門外」，即三界外果德為車，故下合譬談皆以果德合之，舉涅槃合羊車，舉自然惠合鹿車，舉佛果四德智合牛車，舉大涅槃果德合大車，故云「皆以如來滅度而滅度之」，又舉佛果眾德以合大車，故云「悉與諸佛解脫三昧」，故名等賜大車，則知三車一車皆是果乘非因乘矣。	《法花》明三車一車皆悉是果，故〈譬喻品〉云「今此三車皆是在門外」，即三界外果德為車，故下合譬談皆以果德合之，舉涅槃合羊車，舉自然惠合鹿車，舉佛果四德智合牛車，舉大涅槃果德合大車，故云「皆以如來滅度而滅度之」，又舉佛果眾德以合大車，故云「悉與諸佛解脫三昧」，故名等賜大車，則知三車一車皆是果乘非因乘矣。	001	The Lotus Sutra explains that the three carts and one cart are all fruits. Therefore, the Parable Chapter says, Now these three carts are all outside the gate, which means that the fruition virtues outside the three realms are the carts. Therefore, the following combined parable all combines them with the fruition virtues. Taking nirvana to combine with the sheep cart, taking natural wisdom to combine with the deer cart, taking the four virtues and wisdom of the Buddha's fruition to combine with the ox cart, and taking the fruition virtues of great nirvana to combine with the great cart, it says, All by means of the Tathagata's nirvana to bring about nirvana. It also takes the many virtues of the Buddha's fruition to combine with the great cart, so it says, All give the liberation samadhi of the buddhas. Therefore, it is called equally bestowing the great cart. It should be known that the three carts and one cart are all vehicles of fruition, not vehicles of causes.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c02_17']	又此經秤名「妙法」，妙法者佛果德無不圓、累無不盡，故名為妙；	又此經秤名「妙法」，妙法者佛果德無不圓、累無不盡，故名為妙；	001	Moreover, this sutra is called the Wonderful Dharma. The wonderful dharma is the fruition virtues of the Buddha, which are all perfect and all exhausted, so it is called wonderful;

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c07_10']	諸子求車，佛即賜車，諸子得車即諸子得果，故云乘是寶車直至道場，即知以因為乘寧非乘也。	諸子求車，佛即賜車，諸子得車即諸子得果，故云乘是寶車直至道場，即知以因為乘寧非乘也。	001	When the children sought the vehicle, the Buddha immediately bestowed the vehicle. When the children obtained the vehicle, it means the children attained the fruition. Therefore, it is said that they ride in the jeweled vehicle straight to the place of practice. This shows that taking the cause as the vehicle is indeed the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c08_13']	又《大品》等經皆明乘是因義，何得偏用果為乘耶？	又《大品》等經皆明乘是因義，何得偏用果為乘耶？	001	Moreover, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra and other sūtras all clarify that the vehicle is the meaning of the cause. How can it be appropriate to unilaterally take the fruition as the vehicle?

Second, it extensively explains the disclosure of the Buddha's knowledge and insight. Third, Many Treasures praises the great wisdom as being impartial. Therefore, it is known that in the initial part, from beginning to end, it extensively discusses the virtues of the fruition, not clarifying the cause.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c23_12']	一、《正觀論》云「從因緣品來推求諸法，有亦無、無亦無、亦有亦無亦無、非有非無亦無，是名名如、法性、實際、涅槃」，故知求有所得因果，不可得即是妙法。	一、《正觀論》云「從因緣品來推求諸法，有亦無、無亦無、亦有亦無亦無、非有非無亦無，是名名如、法性、實際、涅槃」，故知求有所得因果，不可得即是妙法。	001	First, the Zhengguan Lun says, From the chapter on causes and conditions, we investigate all dharmas, existence is also non-existent, non-existence is also non-existent, both existence and non-existence are also non-existent, neither existence nor non-existence is also non-existent. This is called the suchness of names, the nature of dharmas, the ultimate reality, and nirvana. Therefore, we know that seeking for obtainable causes and effects is precisely the wonderful Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c25_4']	二者、《法花論》釋〈方便品〉云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著，著有四種：	二者、《法花論》釋〈方便品〉云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著，著有四種：	001	Second, the Fahua Lun explains the chapter on skillful means, saying, I use countless skillful means to guide sentient beings to be free from all attachments. There are four kinds of attachments:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c25_14']	一者著界，謂三界等；	一者著界，謂三界等；	001	First, attachment to realms, referring to the three realms and so forth;

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c27_9']	三者分著，謂在家著五欲、出家著名利；	三者分著，謂在家著五欲、出家著名利；	001	Third, partial attachment, referring to householders attached to the five desires and renunciants attached to fame and profit;

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0637c29_2']	故知有所著不名妙法，無所著即是經宗。	故知有所著不名妙法，無所著即是經宗。	001	Therefore, we know that having attachments is not called the wonderful Dharma, and being without attachments is precisely the main purport of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0638a03_1']	三者關中肇公《百論．序》云「蕭焉無寄理自玄會，儻然靡據事不失真，變本之道著乎茲矣」，故知心無所依著即是妙法，為此經宗也。	三者關中肇公《百論．序》云「蕭焉無寄理自玄會，儻然靡據事不失真，變本之道著乎茲矣」，故知心無所依著即是妙法，為此經宗也。	001	Third, the preface to the Hundred Treatises by Master ZHAO of Guanzhong says, Solitary and unattached, the principle is mysteriously in accord; seemingly without basis, phenomena do not lose their truth. The way of transforming the basis is seen here. Therefore, we know that the mind without any attachment is the wondrous Dharma, which is the main purport of this sutra.

If sentient beings should hear causes as the main purport and attain enlightenment, then causes are explained for them. If those who should hear the fruition as the main purport attain enlightenment, then the fruition is explained for them. If those who should hear both causes and fruition as the main purport attain enlightenment, then causes and fruition are explained for them.

The author of the treatise does not judge them as right or wrong, because they all come from the Buddha's mouth and are able to open the way and always benefit beings, so they are all orthodox sūtras.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0638a19_5']	五者、《中論．觀法品》云「諸法無決定相，諸佛有無量方便，或說一切實、或說一切不實、亦實亦非實、非實非非實，四句並皆得道，皆是佛法」。	五者、《中論．觀法品》云「諸法無決定相，諸佛有無量方便，或說一切實、或說一切不實、亦實亦非實、非實非非實，四句並皆得道，皆是佛法」。	001	Fifth, the Zhonglun, Guanfa pin says, All dharmas have no definite characteristics. The Buddhas have immeasurable skillful means. Sometimes they say everything is real, sometimes they say everything is unreal, both real and unreal, neither real nor unreal. All four statements lead to the Way and are the Buddha Dharma.

Those with biased attachments have right and wrong, but the enlightened ones have no conflicts.

The first, the section on the intention of establishing the name, the Nirvana Sutra says: Dīrghāyu, although he does not really eat oil, he is forcefully called one who eats oil. Nirvana is also like this, although it is actually without names and characteristics, it is forcefully called by names and characteristics.

Since nirvana is without names and characteristics and is forcefully called by names and characteristics, the Lotus Sūtra is also without names and characteristics and is forcefully called by names and characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0638c14_8']	所以強名相說者，欲令眾生因名以悟理、因理以起行、因行以得解脫故也。	所以強名相說者，欲令眾生因名以悟理、因理以起行、因行以得解脫故也。	001	The reason for forcefully calling it by names and characteristics is to enable sentient beings to awaken to the principle through the name, to arouse practice through the principle, and to attain liberation through practice.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0638c21_18']	二、立名不同門者，眾經或佛自立名，或待弟子發問然後方立，或序品之中預前立名，或正說之內方始立名字，或隨說一義即立名字，或說一經竟最後制名，或一經之內但標一題，或一經之內立於多名，或有眾經立於一名字，或有一部無別立名，立名不同略有五雙十義，具如《淨名玄義》已廣述之。	二、立名不同門者，眾經或佛自立名，或待弟子發問然後方立，或序品之中預前立名，或正說之內方始立名字，或隨說一義即立名字，或說一經竟最後制名，或一經之內但標一題，或一經之內立於多名，或有眾經立於一名字，或有一部無別立名，立名不同略有五雙十義，具如《淨名玄義》已廣述之。	001	Second, in terms of the different ways of establishing names, various sūtras sometimes have the Buddha himself establish the name, sometimes disciples make inquiries and then the name is established, sometimes the name is preemptively established in the introductory chapter, sometimes the name is established within the main teaching, sometimes the name is established based on a single meaning that is taught, sometimes the name is established at the very end after the entire sūtra is taught, sometimes a single sūtra only has one title, sometimes a single sūtra has many names, sometimes many sūtras have the same name, and sometimes a single text does not have a separate established name. The different ways of establishing names are roughly five pairs and ten meanings, which are already extensively discussed in the Profound Meaning of the Vimalakīrti Sūtra.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a01_5']	如《涅槃》云「或名法鏡或云名甘露鼓」等，今此《法花經》於二種中名字古今不轉，故大通智勝佛、威音王、二萬日月燈明，及釋迦佛所說，皆稱妙法蓮花。	如《涅槃》云「或名法鏡或云名甘露鼓」等，今此《法花經》於二種中名字古今不轉，故大通智勝佛、威音王、二萬日月燈明，及釋迦佛所說，皆稱妙法蓮花。	001	As the Nirvana Sutra says, It is called the Dharma Mirror or the Drum of Amrita, and so on. This Lotus Sutra, among the two kinds, does not change its name with ancient and modern times. Therefore, the Buddha of Great Permeation and Wisdom, the King of Majestic Sound, the twenty thousand suns and moon lamps, and Shakyamuni Buddha all call it the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a02_8']	所以有轉不轉門者，蓋是隨宜不同，適時而說也。	所以有轉不轉門者，蓋是隨宜不同，適時而說也。	001	The reason there is a gate of turning and not turning is that it is not the same for everyone, but is taught according to the time.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a04_15']	四、具義多少門者，眾經立名多小無定，或一義立名，或二義立名，或三義標名。	四、具義多少門者，眾經立名多小無定，或一義立名，或二義立名，或三義標名。	001	Fourth, the gate of the quantity of meanings: the naming of various sutras has no fixed length, sometimes one meaning is used for the name, sometimes two meanings are used for the name, and sometimes three meanings are used for the title.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a05_21']	一義立名者，或但人、但法、但處、但時、但事、但喻。	一義立名者，或但人、但法、但處、但時、但事、但喻。	001	Using one meaning for the name, it may only be a person, only a dharma, only a place, only a time, only an event, or only a metaphor.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a06_8']	但人者，《提謂》之流；	但人者，《提謂》之流；	001	But for people, it is like the Tidiwei scriptures;

Srimala is the name of a person, lion's roar is a metaphorical name, and great skillful means of the One Vehicle is the Dharma name.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a15_17']	五、前後門者，依天竺梵本前皆無題，但云悉曇，此言好法亦名成就，立名皆在經末。	五、前後門者，依天竺梵本前皆無題，但云悉曇，此言好法亦名成就，立名皆在經末。	001	Fifth, the front and back doors: In the Indian Sanskrit version, there are no titles at the beginning, but only siddham, which means good Dharma or accomplishment. The titles are all at the end of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a17_13']	而迴後在初者，蓋是翻經之人隨震旦國法，欲令因名字不同識部類差別故也。	而迴後在初者，蓋是翻經之人隨震旦國法，欲令因名字不同識部類差別故也。	001	But the later part is placed at the beginning, which is probably because the translator followed the Chinese method, wanting to use different names to recognize the differences in the categories.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a19_19']	六、翻譯門者，依梵本云「薩達摩分陀利修多羅」，竺法護翻薩為正，故云「正法花經」；	六、翻譯門者，依梵本云「薩達摩分陀利修多羅」，竺法護翻薩為正，故云「正法花經」；	001	Sixth, the translation section: According to the Sanskrit version, it says Sadharmapundarika Sutra. Zhu Fahu translated sa as zheng, so it says Zhengfahua Jing.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a21_15']	晉羅什翻薩為妙，故云「妙法蓮花經」，逕山慧遠雙用前二，更加兩名，謂「真法好法」。	晉羅什翻薩為妙，故云「妙法蓮花經」，逕山慧遠雙用前二，更加兩名，謂「真法好法」。	001	In the Jin Dynasty, Kumarajiva translated sa as miao, so it says Miaofa Lianhuajing. Huìyuǎn of Jìngshān used both previous two, and added two more names, namely Zhēnfǎ and Hǎofǎ.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a23_2']	今謂天竺一題名具含眾義，譯經之人隨取一義故各別翻之耳。	今謂天竺一題名具含眾義，譯經之人隨取一義故各別翻之耳。	001	Now, I think that a single title in India contains many meanings. The translators each translate it based on one meaning.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a24_14']	所言具含多義者，然諸佛所行之道未曾邪正，為對內外二邪故立為正：	所言具含多義者，然諸佛所行之道未曾邪正，為對內外二邪故立為正：	001	As for the phrase containing many meanings, the way practiced by all Buddhas has never been biased or correct. In contrast to the two biases of internal and external, it is established as correct:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639a26_17']	一者、九十六種所說之法，稱之為邪，如來所說之法目之為正，故對彼異道之邪明佛道為正。	一者、九十六種所說之法，稱之為邪，如來所說之法目之為正，故對彼異道之邪明佛道為正。	001	First, the teachings expounded by the ninety-six kinds of teachings are called biased. The teachings expounded by the Tathāgata are called correct. Therefore, in contrast to the biases of the heterodox paths, the Buddha's path is clarified as correct.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639b19_16']	凡有三義：	凡有三義：	001	There are three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639b21_12']	一者、經有妙文而無正稱，如云「我法妙難思」，又云「是乘微妙清淨第一」，即其證也。	一者、經有妙文而無正稱，如云「我法妙難思」，又云「是乘微妙清淨第一」，即其證也。	001	First, the sutra has marvelous words but no correct appellation, such as saying my Dharma is marvelous and difficult to conceive, and also saying this vehicle is subtle, pure, and supreme, which are the evidence.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639b23_14']	二者、妙是精微深遠之稱，立妙名則稱歎義便，以我法微妙凡夫二乘及以始行菩薩不能思量義。	二者、妙是精微深遠之稱，立妙名則稱歎義便，以我法微妙凡夫二乘及以始行菩薩不能思量義。	001	Second, wonderful is a term for subtlety, profundity, and distance. If the name wonderful is established, then the meaning of praise is convenient. It is because the meaning of my Dharma is subtle, and ordinary people, the two vehicles, and beginner bodhisattvas are unable to contemplate it.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639b24_17']	若云我法正難思義，則方言不巧、於義不便也。	若云我法正難思義，則方言不巧、於義不便也。	001	If it is said that my Dharma is precisely difficult to contemplate, then the language is not skillful and the meaning is inconvenient.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639b27_8']	三者、次就義推，夫正以形耶受稱，妙以待麁得名，宜以九十六法為邪，如來五乘之法稱正，故正在五乘之法也。	三者、次就義推，夫正以形耶受稱，妙以待麁得名，宜以九十六法為邪，如來五乘之法稱正，故正在五乘之法也。	001	Third, next, from the perspective of meaning, the correct is named based on the heretical, and the wonderful is named based on the coarse. It is appropriate to take the ninety-six dharmas as heretical, and the Tathāgata's five vehicles of Dharma are called correct, therefore the correct is in the five vehicles of Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c01_3']	五乘雖正，正而猶麁，唯一乘之法乃稱為妙，故妙主於一也，不得云外道為麁、五乘為妙，亦不得云五乘為邪、一乘為正。	五乘雖正，正而猶麁，唯一乘之法乃稱為妙，故妙主於一也，不得云外道為麁、五乘為妙，亦不得云五乘為邪、一乘為正。	001	Although the five vehicles are correct, the correct is still coarse. Only the one vehicle of Dharma is called wonderful, therefore the wonderful is the master of the one. It cannot be said that non-Buddhist teachings are coarse and the five vehicles are wonderful, nor can it be said that the five vehicles are heretical and the one vehicle is correct.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c01_17']	外道之形佛法，其猶石之與玉；	外道之形佛法，其猶石之與玉；	001	The contrast between non-Buddhist teachings and Buddhist teachings is like that between stone and jade;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c03_8']	五乘之與一乘，同皆是玉，但玉有精麁，故以五乘為麁、一乘為妙也。	五乘之與一乘，同皆是玉，但玉有精麁，故以五乘為麁、一乘為妙也。	001	The five vehicles and the one vehicle are both jade, but jade has fine and coarse distinctions, so the five vehicles are considered coarse and the one vehicle is considered wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c04_17']	第七、釋名門，今解達摩之法則釋妙義。	第七、釋名門，今解達摩之法則釋妙義。	001	Seventh, the section on explaining the name, now explaining the Dharma method is explaining the wonderful meaning.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c05_18']	此經文雖七軸，宗歸一乘，宜以一乘之法為妙。	此經文雖七軸，宗歸一乘，宜以一乘之法為妙。	001	Although the text of this sutra has seven scrolls, the main point returns to the one vehicle, which should be considered wonderful based on the Dharma of the one vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c07_17']	故〈譬喻品〉云「是乘微妙清淨第一，於諸世間為無有上」，此偈對四乘之麁歎佛乘為妙。	故〈譬喻品〉云「是乘微妙清淨第一，於諸世間為無有上」，此偈對四乘之麁歎佛乘為妙。	001	Therefore, the Parable Chapter says, This vehicle is subtle, pure, and supreme, unsurpassed in the world. This verse praises the Buddha vehicle as wonderful in contrast to the coarseness of the four vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c09_6']	上半對二乘之麁嘆佛乘為妙，下半對人天乘之麁嘆佛乘為妙。	上半對二乘之麁嘆佛乘為妙，下半對人天乘之麁嘆佛乘為妙。	001	The first half praises the Buddha vehicle as wonderful in contrast to the coarseness of the two vehicles, and the second half praises the Buddha vehicle as wonderful in contrast to the coarseness of the human and heavenly vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c11_5']	「是乘」者，謂佛乘也，「微妙清淨」者，歎佛乘也，以德無不圓故云微妙，累無不盡故名清淨。	「是乘」者，謂佛乘也，「微妙清淨」者，歎佛乘也，以德無不圓故云微妙，累無不盡故名清淨。	001	This vehicle refers to the Buddha vehicle. Subtle and pure praises the Buddha vehicle. Since its virtues are all-encompassing, it is called subtle. Since its afflictions are all exhausted, it is called pure.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c12_15']	又夫論累者所謂麁也，在麁既盡則眾德並圓，累盡德圓故稱為妙。	又夫論累者所謂麁也，在麁既盡則眾德並圓，累盡德圓故稱為妙。	001	Moreover, to discuss the afflictions is to speak of the coarse. When the coarse is exhausted, then the myriad virtues are all complete. Because the afflictions are exhausted and virtues are complete, it is called wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c16_4']	又累無不盡不可為有，德無不圓不可言無，非有非無則中道之法，故稱為妙，同大涅槃空不空義，以空無二十五有不可言有，有常樂我淨不可言無。	又累無不盡不可為有，德無不圓不可言無，非有非無則中道之法，故稱為妙，同大涅槃空不空義，以空無二十五有不可言有，有常樂我淨不可言無。	001	Moreover, because the afflictions are not non-exhausted, they cannot be said to exist. Because the virtues are not non-complete, they cannot be said to be non-existent. Being neither existent nor non-existent is the Dharma of the Middle Way, and thus it is called wonderful. It is the same as the meaning of emptiness and non-emptiness in the Great Nirvana, because emptiness is devoid of the twenty-five existences and cannot be said to exist, and existence has permanence, bliss, self, and purity and cannot be said to be non-existent.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c19_1']	而一乘與大涅槃更無有異，故〈譬喻品〉云「舉大涅槃合於大車」，故云「不令有人獨得滅度，皆以如來滅度而滅度之」，則其證也。	而一乘與大涅槃更無有異，故〈譬喻品〉云「舉大涅槃合於大車」，故云「不令有人獨得滅度，皆以如來滅度而滅度之」，則其證也。	001	The One Vehicle is no different from the Great Nirvana, thus the Parable Chapter says, Taking the Great Nirvana to correspond to the great carriage. Therefore it says, Not allowing anyone to attain extinction alone, all are to be extinguished through the extinction of the Tathāgata, which is its proof.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c21_1']	所言第一者，〈方便品〉云「唯有一佛乘，無有餘乘若二若三」，則知第一之名對二三而起也。	所言第一者，〈方便品〉云「唯有一佛乘，無有餘乘若二若三」，則知第一之名對二三而起也。	001	As for the term first, the Skillful Means Chapter says, There is only the One Buddha Vehicle, there is no other vehicle, whether second or third. Thus we know that the name first arises in contrast to second and third.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c23_9']	以二三乘累猶未盡、德猶未圓，如《涅槃》云「二乘之人但見於空、不見不空，故不行中道，不得稱為第一」。	以二三乘累猶未盡、德猶未圓，如《涅槃》云「二乘之人但見於空、不見不空，故不行中道，不得稱為第一」。	001	Because the two or three vehicles still have not exhausted their afflictions and their virtues are not yet perfect, as the Nirvana Sutra says, The two vehicles only see emptiness and do not see non-emptiness, therefore they do not practice the middle way and cannot be called supreme.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c25_2']	諸佛如來德無不圓、累無不盡，具見空與不空義，行於中道，故稱為第一也。	諸佛如來德無不圓、累無不盡，具見空與不空義，行於中道，故稱為第一也。	001	The virtues of all Buddhas and Tathagatas are complete and their afflictions are completely exhausted, they fully see the meaning of emptiness and non-emptiness and practice the middle way, therefore they are called supreme.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0639c26_17']	「於諸世間為無有上」，人天為世間，世間乘則非妙，故云於諸世間為無有上也。	「於諸世間為無有上」，人天為世間，世間乘則非妙，故云於諸世間為無有上也。	001	In all worlds, there is none above them, humans and gods are the worlds, and worldly vehicles are not wonderful, therefore it is said that in all worlds there is none above them.

The five precepts lead to the human realm, so the human vehicle is considered wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a01_11']	人乘樂少苦多故稱為麁，十善感得天身則苦少樂多則天乘為妙；	人乘樂少苦多故稱為麁，十善感得天身則苦少樂多則天乘為妙；	001	The happiness of the human vehicle is little and suffering is much, therefore it is called coarse. The ten wholesome deeds lead to the heavenly body, with little suffering and much happiness, so the heavenly vehicle is considered wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a02_16']	人天未勉生老病死故名為麁，聲聞得出三界故名為妙；	人天未勉生老病死故名為麁，聲聞得出三界故名為妙；	001	Because humans and gods have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, and death, they are called coarse. Because śrāvakas have left the three realms, they are called subtle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a04_1']	聲聞福少鈍根稱之為麁，緣覺福厚利根名之為妙；	聲聞福少鈍根稱之為麁，緣覺福厚利根名之為妙；	001	Because śrāvakas have little merit and dull faculties, they are called coarse. Because pratyekabuddhas have abundant merit and sharp faculties, they are called subtle.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a05_17']	聲聞緣覺累猶未盡、德猶未圓故稱為麁，唯有佛乘德無不圓、累無不盡故稱為妙。	聲聞緣覺累猶未盡、德猶未圓故稱為麁，唯有佛乘德無不圓、累無不盡故稱為妙。	001	Because śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas still have not exhausted their afflictions and have not yet perfected their virtues, they are called coarse. Only the Buddha vehicle, whose virtues are not incomplete and whose afflictions are not unexhausted, is called subtle.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a11_1']	又〈藥草喻品〉云「究竟涅槃常寂滅相終歸於空」，終歸於空者，終灰身滅智入無餘涅槃，故猶是無常；	又〈藥草喻品〉云「究竟涅槃常寂滅相終歸於空」，終歸於空者，終灰身滅智入無餘涅槃，故猶是無常；	001	And the Parable of the Herbs chapter says, The ultimate nirvāṇa, the appearance of eternal quiescence, ultimately returns to emptiness. Ultimately returning to emptiness means ultimately burning the body, extinguishing cognition, and entering nirvāṇa without remainder. Therefore, it is still impermanent.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a11_12']	至《大涅槃》方辨常住。	至《大涅槃》方辨常住。	001	It is only in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra that it is distinguished as being permanent.

But compared to the previous sūtras that have not yet distinguished the past, which is more numerous than the dust particles, and the future, which is twice as many as the above, this sūtra is praised as being wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a14_2']	若望涅槃教，則猶是麁也。	若望涅槃教，則猶是麁也。	001	But compared to the teaching of the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, it is still coarse.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a16_16']	所以然者，此經未除八倒、不明四德，但明壽命無窮，故是覆相辨常；	所以然者，此經未除八倒、不明四德，但明壽命無窮，故是覆相辨常；	001	The reason for this is that this sūtra has not yet eliminated the eight inversions and has not clarified the four virtues. It only clarifies that lifespan is endless, so it is the teaching of permanence through concealment;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640a17_6']	至涅槃教方顯了辨常。	至涅槃教方顯了辨常。	001	It is only in the teaching of the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra that permanence is clearly distinguished.

The Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra says, Because the three bodies are different, apart from them is the Tathāgata. Therefore, we know that the Tathāgata is not a conditioned dharma, and the body is precisely the eternally abiding.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b04_4']	《淨名．方便品》云「此身可患厭，當樂法身」，蓋是毀生死身無常，即歎法身常住，故逼引之教成、欣厭之觀立。	《淨名．方便品》云「此身可患厭，當樂法身」，蓋是毀生死身無常，即歎法身常住，故逼引之教成、欣厭之觀立。	001	The Vimalakīrti Sūtra, in the chapter on skillful means, says, This body can be despised and loathed, one should delight in the dharma body. This is precisely the criticism of the impermanence of the body of birth and death, and the praise of the eternally abiding dharma body. Therefore, the teachings of coercion and guidance are established, and the contemplation of delight and loathing is set up.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b05_9']	若生死無常法身復改起滅者，則同可厭棄，何所欣哉？	若生死無常法身復改起滅者，則同可厭棄，何所欣哉？	001	If birth and death are impermanent and the dharma body also changes and arises and ceases, then they are the same in being despicable and abandoned. What is there to delight in?

The Dharma body is unconditioned and does not fall into any categories, which clarifies that the fruition of Buddhahood is unconditioned and eternally abiding.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b10_2']	尋《波若》、《淨名》，是《法花》前教當辨常住，《法花》居二經之後，寧是無常耶？	尋《波若》、《淨名》，是《法花》前教當辨常住，《法花》居二經之後，寧是無常耶？	001	Examining the Prajñāpāramitā and Vimalakīrti sūtras, which are teachings prior to the Lotus Sūtra, they should clarify eternal abiding.

All phenomena from the beginning have always been characterized by quiescent extinction. This passage clarifies the true and false of the two cessations of the small and great vehicles in the past and present.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b18_7']	〈譬喻品〉云「但離虛妄名為解脫，其實未得一切解脫」，聲聞之人但斷四住惑，名離虛妄，未斷無明住地，即顯今教具斷五住地名一切解脫。	〈譬喻品〉云「但離虛妄名為解脫，其實未得一切解脫」，聲聞之人但斷四住惑，名離虛妄，未斷無明住地，即顯今教具斷五住地名一切解脫。	001	The Chapter on Parables says, Only by leaving false thoughts is it called liberation, but in reality one has not yet attained complete liberation. The śrāvakas only sever the four abodes of delusion, which is called leaving false thoughts, but they have not yet severed the ground of nescience, which shows that the teachings of this sūtra completely sever the five abodes of delusion and are called complete liberation.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b20_3']	若爾者，小乘之人二生死之因未傾故是無常，如來五住地並盡所以是常住。	若爾者，小乘之人二生死之因未傾故是無常，如來五住地並盡所以是常住。	001	If that is so, then the followers of the Lesser Vehicle, because the causes of the two kinds of birth and death have not yet been exhausted, are impermanent. The Tathāgata has completely exhausted the five abodes of delusion and is therefore permanently abiding.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b24_8']	《法花論》云「復倍上數者，示現如來常命不可盡故」，則知此文非無常矣。	《法花論》云「復倍上數者，示現如來常命不可盡故」，則知此文非無常矣。	001	The Fahua lun says, As for 'double the above number,' it shows that the Tathāgata's eternal life cannot be exhausted. One should know that this passage is not about impermanence.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b26_9']	三、用關河舊釋者，關中僧叡面受羅什《法花》，其經〈序〉云「分身明其不實，壽量定其非數」。	三、用關河舊釋者，關中僧叡面受羅什《法花》，其經〈序〉云「分身明其不實，壽量定其非數」。	001	Third, using the old explanations from Guanzhong: Sengrui of Guanzhong received the Lotus Sutra from Kumārajīva in person. The preface to the sutra says, The manifestation of the multiple bodies clarifies that they are not real, and the determination of the lifespan establishes that it is not a number.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b28_6']	分身明其不實者，釋迦與諸佛互指為分身，則知俱非實佛，實佛者謂如來妙法身也。	分身明其不實者，釋迦與諸佛互指為分身，則知俱非實佛，實佛者謂如來妙法身也。	001	The manifestation of the multiple bodies clarifies that they are not real means that Śākyamuni and the buddhas point to each other as multiple bodies, so it is known that they are all not real buddhas. The real buddha refers to the wondrous Dharma body of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640b29_16']	壽量定其非數者，壽者不可數，明如來壽命不墮諸數中，是常住。	壽量定其非數者，壽者不可數，明如來壽命不墮諸數中，是常住。	001	The determination of the lifespan establishes that it is not a number means that the lifespan cannot be counted, clarifying that the lifespan of the Tathāgata does not fall into any numbers, and is thus eternal.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c02_6']	與《法花論》玄會也，又與《淨名經》「佛身無為不墮諸數」其義同也。	與《法花論》玄會也，又與《淨名經》「佛身無為不墮諸數」其義同也。	001	This accords with the profound meaning of the Lotus Sutra Treatise, and also has the same meaning as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, which states, The body of the Buddha is unconditioned and does not fall into any categories.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c06_18']	河西道朗著《法花疏》，釋〈見寶塔品〉「明法身常住理無存沒，亦〈壽量品〉明如來壽量同虛空，一切世間唯身與命，今隨從世法亦明斯兩，故前明法身常、後辨壽無滅」，與《涅槃經》前明長壽、後辨金剛身無異也。	河西道朗著《法花疏》，釋〈見寶塔品〉「明法身常住理無存沒，亦〈壽量品〉明如來壽量同虛空，一切世間唯身與命，今隨從世法亦明斯兩，故前明法身常、後辨壽無滅」，與《涅槃經》前明長壽、後辨金剛身無異也。	001	Dao Lang of Hexi wrote the Fahua Shu, explaining the Seeing the Treasure Pagoda Chapter, clarifying the principle of the permanence of the Dharma body, without existence or non-existence, also the Lifespan Chapter clarifies the Tathagata's lifespan is the same as empty space, all worlds only have body and life, now following worldly dharmas also clarifies these two, therefore, the previous clarifies the permanence of the Dharma body, and later distinguishes the non-extinction of lifespan, which is no different from the Nirvana Sutra's previous clarification of long life and later distinction of the indestructible vajra body.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c07_10']	第四、明用義難者，凡有十義：	第四、明用義難者，凡有十義：	001	Fourth, clarifying the difficult meaning of application, there are ten meanings in total:
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c10_8']	一者、此經雖明因果而妙義在果，因未圓極則猶未妙，若佛果猶是無常，無常則苦，既無常苦則無我不淨，乃是麁法，何名為妙？	一者、此經雖明因果而妙義在果，因未圓極則猶未妙，若佛果猶是無常，無常則苦，既無常苦則無我不淨，乃是麁法，何名為妙？	001	First, although this sutra clarifies cause and effect, the wonderful meaning lies in the effect. If the cause is not yet perfect, it is still not wonderful. If the Buddha's effect is still impermanent, impermanence is suffering. Since it is impermanent and suffering, there is no self and impurity, which is a coarse dharma. How can it be called wonderful?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c12_3']	二者、經云「為一大事因緣故出現於世」，何容終始以無常不了麁法以化物耶？	二者、經云「為一大事因緣故出現於世」，何容終始以無常不了麁法以化物耶？	001	Second, the sūtra says for the sake of the one great matter of the cause and condition of appearance in the world, how could it be appropriate to end with impermanence, and to transform beings with the unclear coarse dharmas?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c12_17']	此則乖父子恩情、傷諸佛本意。	此則乖父子恩情、傷諸佛本意。	001	This would then go against the affection between father and son, and injure the fundamental intention of all buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c13_17']	三者、前明一乘異昔三乘，後明常住異昔無常。	三者、前明一乘異昔三乘，後明常住異昔無常。	001	Third, previously it clarified the one vehicle as different from the former three vehicles, and later it clarified the eternal abiding as different from the former impermanence.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c14_18']	以一乘異昔三乘故，得以一乘為藥破於三病；	以一乘異昔三乘故，得以一乘為藥破於三病；	001	Because the one vehicle is different from the former three vehicles, one can use the one vehicle as medicine to break through the three illnesses;
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c16_8']	以常異昔無常故，亦得以常住為藥破無常病，則是雙治之義。	以常異昔無常故，亦得以常住為藥破無常病，則是雙治之義。	001	because the eternal is different from the former impermanence, one can also use eternal abiding as medicine to break through the illness of impermanence, which is the meaning of treating both.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c18_3']	若今猶是無常者，但有以一破三，無有以常破無常，則治病未圓、顯理不足。	若今猶是無常者，但有以一破三，無有以常破無常，則治病未圓、顯理不足。	001	If it is still impermanent now, there is only using the one to break the three, and there is not using the eternal to break impermanence, then treating the illness is not complete, and revealing the principle is insufficient.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c20_5']	四者、若一乘異三，而一乘之果猶是無常者，則還同昔異，終是三乘，則無一乘教，都無兩治也。	四者、若一乘異三，而一乘之果猶是無常者，則還同昔異，終是三乘，則無一乘教，都無兩治也。	001	Fourth, if the One Vehicle is different from the Three, and the fruit of the One Vehicle is still impermanent, then it would still be the same as before, and ultimately still the Three Vehicles. There would then be no teaching of the One Vehicle at all, and no two remedies.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c22_1']	五者、又若今一異昔三而無常猶同昔，則因果果聲聞果同羅漢，都非義也。	五者、又若今一異昔三而無常猶同昔，則因果果聲聞果同羅漢，都非義也。	001	Fifth, moreover, if the present One is different from the Three of the past and is still impermanent, the same as before, then the fruit of the cause and the fruit of the śrāvakas would be the same as the arhat. This is not the meaning at all.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c25_5']	六者、前文明身子為請主，而身子小乘中之極、執異之窮，故說一乘令改小入大捨異歸同，則大有接小之義、小有欣大之理，則初分經機教符會；	六者、前文明身子為請主，而身子小乘中之極、執異之窮，故說一乘令改小入大捨異歸同，則大有接小之義、小有欣大之理，則初分經機教符會；	001	Sixth, in the previous chapter, Śāriputra is clarified as the host of the request. Śāriputra is the ultimate of the Lesser Vehicle and the extreme of grasping at difference. Therefore, the One Vehicle is taught to make him abandon the Lesser and enter the Great, and to abandon difference and return to sameness. Then the Great has the meaning of receiving the Lesser, and the Lesser has the principle of delighting in the Great. Then the first part of the sūtra's host and teaching are in accord.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0640c27_19']	後分經彌勒為請主，彌勒是因位之窮、無常之極，若說佛果猶是無常，則果無接因之理、因無欣果之義，便機教相乖也。	後分經彌勒為請主，彌勒是因位之窮、無常之極，若說佛果猶是無常，則果無接因之理、因無欣果之義，便機教相乖也。	001	In the latter part of the sūtra, Maitreya is the host of the request. Maitreya is the extreme of the stage of causes and the extreme of impermanence. If the Buddha-fruit is still said to be impermanent, then the fruit has no principle of receiving the causes, and the causes have no meaning of delighting in the fruit. Then the host and teaching are in disagreement.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0641a02_9']	七者、天親釋〈壽量品〉明於三身，伽耶成佛為化身，久已得佛壽命無量為報身，無有生死若退若出、非實非虛非如非異為法身，既具明三身，豈非是常住？	七者、天親釋〈壽量品〉明於三身，伽耶成佛為化身，久已得佛壽命無量為報身，無有生死若退若出、非實非虛非如非異為法身，既具明三身，豈非是常住？	001	Seventh, Vasubandhu's commentary on the chapter on life span clarifies the three bodies. The Buddha's enlightenment at Gayā is the transformation body, the attainment of the immeasurable life span of the reward body is long past, there is no birth and death, no regression or emergence, it is neither real nor false, neither thus nor different, as the Dharma body. Since it clearly explains the three bodies, how could it not be the eternal abode?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0641a05_5']	八者、《涅槃經．菩薩品》云「如《法花經》八千聲聞，得受記別成大果實，如秋收冬藏更無所作」，故知《法花》顯了究竟，豈不明常耶？	八者、《涅槃經．菩薩品》云「如《法花經》八千聲聞，得受記別成大果實，如秋收冬藏更無所作」，故知《法花》顯了究竟，豈不明常耶？	001	Eighth, the Nirvana Sutra, in the chapter on bodhisattvas, says, Like the Lotus Sutra, the eight thousand śrāvakas received predictions and accomplished great fruits, like autumn harvest and winter storage, with nothing more to do. Therefore, we know that the Lotus Sutra is clearly the ultimate, how could it not clarify the eternal?
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0641a07_16']	九者、二萬日月燈明佛說《法花經》竟便入涅槃，當知說了義之法已竟然後滅耳，若未說了義之法則便不得滅也。	九者、二萬日月燈明佛說《法花經》竟便入涅槃，當知說了義之法已竟然後滅耳，若未說了義之法則便不得滅也。	001	Ninth, the two myriads of sun and moon lamp buddhas finished expounding the Lotus Sutra and then entered nirvana. We should know that after finishing the teaching of definitive meaning, they then passed away. If the definitive meaning had not yet been taught, then they would not have been able to pass away.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0641a20_3']	乘方便謂三因三果，乘真實謂一因一果，身方便謂生滅無常之身，身真實謂無生滅常住身。	乘方便謂三因三果，乘真實謂一因一果，身方便謂生滅無常之身，身真實謂無生滅常住身。	001	The expedient of the vehicle refers to the three causes and three fruits, the truth of the vehicle refers to the one cause and one fruit, the expedient of the body refers to the body of birth and cessation that is impermanent, and the truth of the body refers to the body of no birth and cessation that is eternally abiding.

The Lotus Sutra extensively clarifies the One Vehicle and briefly discusses the meaning of permanence, while the Nirvana Sutra extensively clarifies eternal abiding and briefly discusses the One Vehicle.

Therefore, the Chapter on Belief and Understanding says: But he did not explain to me. You should have a share of the Tathagata's knowledge and vision, the treasure store. This is the evidence.

Because of the teachings, the principle becomes manifest. Therefore, it uses the lotus flower as a metaphor for principle and teachings. Thus, the sutra says, Its meaning is profound and far-reaching, its words are skillful and wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0643b14_3']	三者、花未開而實未現，花開則實方顯，未開方便門則真實相未顯，開方便門則真實相方顯，故以花開喻方便門開，實現譬真實相顯也。	三者、花未開而實未現，花開則實方顯，未開方便門則真實相未顯，開方便門則真實相方顯，故以花開喻方便門開，實現譬真實相顯也。	001	Third, before the flower blooms, the fruit is not yet manifest. When the flower blooms, the fruit becomes evident. Before the gate of skillful means is opened, the true nature is not yet manifest. When the gate of skillful means is opened, the true nature becomes evident. Therefore, it uses the blooming of the flower as a metaphor for the opening of the gate of skillful means, and the manifestation of the fruit as a metaphor for the manifestation of the true nature.

It also says, This flower is where Buddhas and Bodhisattvas sit. This sutra is also for causing those who abandon the contemptible people of the two vehicles to equally enter the One Vehicle and sit together with Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on the wondrous lotus flower seat. Therefore, it borrows the lotus flower as a metaphor.

The six destinies are in turmoil, truly resulting from attachment. Therefore, know that the suffering of the turning current sea uses attachment as its source. The transcendence of the other shore uses non-attainment as its basis. But because the accumulation of fruits is not one, there are many gates for stopping inversions. Either beginning and end are both great, or beginning and end are both small, or beginning is small and end is great, or beginning is great and end is small, or within one time, both great and small are clarified, or in immeasurable time, only one dharma is discerned, or different dharmas are explained but are not the same before and after, or the same dharma is clarified but is different in the beginning and end. It is precisely because the understanding of capacities is not one that the adaptation of teachings has no fixed direction. It cannot be limited to the five periods or confined to the four teachings.

The three phrases belong to the category of the bodhisattva canon. The revealed teaching of śrāvakas and the non-secret transformation of bodhisattvas are included in the Tripiṭaka teaching.

['ZH_T34_1722_001:0645c09_4']	如《智度論》云「顯示教中說羅漢斷煩惱清淨，菩薩未斷煩惱故不清淨；	如《智度論》云「顯示教中說羅漢斷煩惱清淨，菩薩未斷煩惱故不清淨；	001	As the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, In the exoteric teachings, it is said that arhats have eliminated afflictions and are pure, while bodhisattvas have not yet eliminated afflictions and are therefore impure.

The Prajnaparamita Sutra explains that bodhisattvas become buddhas, which is easy to understand, so it is not secret.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0645c19_6']	故《智度論》云「羅漢作佛，至佛時乃解，論甚深者正可論其餘事」。	故《智度論》云「羅漢作佛，至佛時乃解，論甚深者正可論其餘事」。	001	Therefore the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says, Arhats becoming buddhas is understood only when one becomes a buddha. Discussing the very profound can only discuss other matters.

Here, using one, two, and three as numbers, the One Vehicle is considered one, the pratyekabuddhas are two, and the śrāvakas are three. It can be known that the One Vehicle is still one out of three.

The two vehicles are considered skillful means. Taking off his precious clothes and putting on tattered, dirty clothes, he skillfully approached his son and told him to work diligently.

Therefore, the text says, Only this one truth, the other two are not true, so it clarifies that the One Vehicle is one of the three vehicles.

In the past, for the sake of the two vehicle practitioners, the Buddha taught the expedient body, so the Buddha vehicle is the expedient body. Now, using this teaching to clarify that the Buddha's body is the true one, the true vehicle is different from the expedient Buddha, like the elder on the lion seat is different from the elder wearing tattered and dirty clothes. By discussing the two teachings of the past and present, it clarifies that the Buddha has different expedient and true aspects, therefore the One Vehicle is not one of the three vehicles.

All sentient beings are my children. This shows that this sutra clarifies the way of parents.
['ZH_T34_1722_001:0648c16_20']	父則有樂無苦，子則有苦無樂，今大悲拔子之苦，大慈與子之樂，令一切眾生普皆成佛，故說《法花經》。	父則有樂無苦，子則有苦無樂，今大悲拔子之苦，大慈與子之樂，令一切眾生普皆成佛，故說《法花經》。	001	As a father, one has joy and no suffering. As a child, one has suffering and no joy. Now, with great compassion, one removes the suffering of the child and with great kindness gives the joy of the child.

This sutra discards the different attachments of the five vehicles and establishes the profound ultimate truth. Therefore, it criticizes ordinary people and sages, rejects the great and destroys the small. It refers to heavenly demons as poisonous insects and speaks of non-Buddhist paths as evil ghosts. It denigrates those who cling to the small vehicle as poor and lowly, and humbles bodhisattvas as beginners. Therefore, heavenly demons hate to hear it, non-Buddhists find it offensive, the two vehicles are startled, and bodhisattvas are timid.
