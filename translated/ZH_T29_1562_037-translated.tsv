['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a11_11', 'ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a12_18']	靜慮律儀與心俱得。🔽若得有漏近分根本靜慮地心靜慮律儀，爾時便得彼心俱故。	靜慮律儀與心俱得。 若得有漏近分根本靜慮地心靜慮律儀，爾時便得彼心俱故。	037	The precepts of concentration are obtained together with the mind.🔽If one obtains the mind of the stage of the contaminated formless concentration or fundamental concentration, one then obtains the precepts of concentration that accompany that mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a15_1']	從無色界歿生色界時，隨得彼地中生得靜慮，即亦得彼俱行律儀，無漏律儀亦心俱故。	從無色界歿生色界時，隨得彼地中生得靜慮，即亦得彼俱行律儀，無漏律儀亦心俱故。	037	When one dies in the formless realm and is born in the form realm, one obtains the precepts of concentration that are obtained through birth in that stage, and one also obtains the precepts that accompany them. The uncontaminated precepts are also obtained together with the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a16_13']	若得無漏近分根本靜慮地心，爾時便得，此復二種，謂由加行及離染故。	若得無漏近分根本靜慮地心，爾時便得，此復二種，謂由加行及離染故。	037	If one obtains a pure mind of the stage of access or fundamental meditation, then one obtains it. This is of two kinds: that obtained through added effort and that obtained through freedom from passion.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a17_7']	由加行者，如得勝進加行道攝。	由加行者，如得勝進加行道攝。	037	That obtained through added effort is like that included in the path of added effort that seeks a higher stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a18_2']	由離染者，如得無間解脫道攝。	由離染者，如得無間解脫道攝。	037	That obtained through freedom from passion is like that included in the uninterrupted and liberated paths of the stage of freedom from passion.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a19_1']	彼聲為顯前靜慮心，復說聖言簡取無漏。	彼聲為顯前靜慮心，復說聖言簡取無漏。	037	The word “pure” is used to indicate the mind of the stage of meditation, and the word “holy” is used to distinguish it as pure.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a20_12']	六靜慮地有無漏心，謂未至、中間及四根本定，非三近分，如後當辨。	六靜慮地有無漏心，謂未至、中間及四根本定，非三近分，如後當辨。	037	The six stages of meditation have pure minds, namely, the preliminary concentration, intermediate concentration, and the four fundamental meditations. They are not in the three access concentrations, as will be explained later.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a23_11']	頌言定生得定地者，此言有失，以定地言總攝此地所有諸法律儀，亦是此地所收，是則得律儀由得律儀故，若作是說便無所成。	頌言定生得定地者，此言有失，以定地言總攝此地所有諸法律儀，亦是此地所收，是則得律儀由得律儀故，若作是說便無所成。	037	The verse says that one obtains the precepts of the stage of meditation. This statement is incorrect, because the words “precepts of the stage” generally include all the rules and regulations of this stage, and they are also included in this stage. This means that one obtains the precepts by obtaining the precepts. If this is said, then nothing is accomplished.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a24_10']	經主此中應自思擇，故但應說得靜慮言。	經主此中應自思擇，故但應說得靜慮言。	037	The author of the commentary should consider this himself. Therefore, it should only be said that one obtains the meditation.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a26_10']	別解脫律儀由他教等得，能教他者說名為他，從如是他教力發戒故，說此戒由他教得。	別解脫律儀由他教等得，能教他者說名為他，從如是他教力發戒故，說此戒由他教得。	037	The prātimokṣa precepts are obtained through the power of others, etc. Those who can teach others are called others. Because the precepts are generated from the power of such others' teachings, it is said that these precepts are obtained through the power of others' teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a27_10']	此復二種，謂從僧伽、補特伽羅有差別故。	此復二種，謂從僧伽、補特伽羅有差別故。	037	This is further divided into two kinds, namely, from the Saṃgha and from individuals, because there are distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a28_7']	從僧伽得者，謂苾芻、苾芻尼及正學戒。	從僧伽得者，謂苾芻、苾芻尼及正學戒。	037	Those obtained from the Saṃgha refer to the precepts of fully ordained monks, fully ordained nuns, and those in the stage of right practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551a29_2']	從補特伽羅得者，謂餘五種戒。	從補特伽羅得者，謂餘五種戒。	037	Those obtained from individuals refer to the remaining five kinds of precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b01_10']	諸毘奈耶毘婆沙師說，有十種得具戒法，為攝彼故復說等言。	諸毘奈耶毘婆沙師說，有十種得具戒法，為攝彼故復說等言。	037	The masters of the Vinaya say that there are ten ways of obtaining the precepts of full ordination. In order to include those, the word etc. is again used.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b01_15']	何者為十？	何者為十？	037	What are the ten?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b03_4']	一由自然，謂佛獨覺自然，謂智以不從師，證此智時得具足戒。	一由自然，謂佛獨覺自然，謂智以不從師，證此智時得具足戒。	037	First, by oneself, referring to the Buddha and pratyekabuddhas who attain enlightenment by themselves. That is to say, they realize this wisdom without a teacher, and when they realize this wisdom, they obtain the precepts of full ordination.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b04_8']	二由佛命善來苾芻，謂耶舍等由本願力、佛威加故。	二由佛命善來苾芻，謂耶舍等由本願力、佛威加故。	037	Second, by the Buddha's command, Come, bhikṣu, referring to Yaśas and others who, by the power of their original vows and the Buddha's spiritual power,
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b05_10']	三由得入正性離生，謂五苾芻由證見道得具足戒。	三由得入正性離生，謂五苾芻由證見道得具足戒。	037	Third, by entering the stage of certainty of liberation, that is, the five bhikṣus who, by realizing the path of seeing, attained the complete precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b06_6']	四由信受佛為大師，謂大迦葉。	四由信受佛為大師，謂大迦葉。	037	Fourth, by believing and accepting the Buddha as their teacher, that is, Mahākāśyapa.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b06_20']	五由善巧酬答所問，謂蘇陀夷。	五由善巧酬答所問，謂蘇陀夷。	037	Fifth, by skillfully answering questions, that is, Sudayin.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b07_13']	六由敬受八尊重法，謂大生主。	六由敬受八尊重法，謂大生主。	037	Sixth, by respectfully accepting the eight weighty precepts, that is, Mahāprajāpatī.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b08_3']	七由遣使，謂法授尼。	七由遣使，謂法授尼。	037	Seventh, by sending a messenger, that is, the nun Dharmadinnā.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b08_17']	八由持律為第五人，謂於邊國。	八由持律為第五人，謂於邊國。	037	Eighth, by having a vinaya master as the fifth person, that is, in border regions.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b09_7']	九由十眾，謂於中國。	九由十眾，謂於中國。	037	Ninth, by a group of ten, that is, in central regions.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b10_7']	十由三說歸佛法僧，謂六十賢部共集受具戒。	十由三說歸佛法僧，謂六十賢部共集受具戒。	037	Tenth, by reciting three times that one takes refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, that is, the group of sixty elders who gathered together to receive the complete precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b12_5']	此中或由本願力故，或阿世耶極圓滿故，或薄伽梵威所加故，隨其所應得具足戒。	此中或由本願力故，或阿世耶極圓滿故，或薄伽梵威所加故，隨其所應得具足戒。	037	Here, it is due to the power of their original vows, or because their intentions are extremely complete, or because they are empowered by the Bhagavān's authority, that they attain the complete precepts, according to their respective circumstances.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b13_4']	如是所說別解律儀，應齊幾時要期而受？	如是所說別解律儀，應齊幾時要期而受？	037	To what extent should the prātimokṣa precepts be received with a vow?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b13_7']	頌曰：	頌曰：	037	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b14_13']	別解脫律儀，　　盡壽或晝夜。	別解脫律儀，　　盡壽或晝夜。	037	The prātimokṣa restraint lasts either for life or for a day and night.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b15_2']	論曰：	論曰：	037	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b16_1']	七眾所依別解脫戒，唯應盡壽要期而受。	七眾所依別解脫戒，唯應盡壽要期而受。	037	The prātimokṣa restraint that is the basis for the seven assemblies must be received with a vow to last for life.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b16_19']	近住所依別解脫戒，唯一晝夜要期而受。	近住所依別解脫戒，唯一晝夜要期而受。	037	The prātimokṣa restraint that is the basis for the one-day [vows] must be received with a vow to last for a single day and night.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b17_4']	此時定爾。	此時定爾。	037	This time is fixed.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b17_9']	何因故然？	何因故然？	037	What is the reason for this?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b18_9']	非毘奈耶相應義理，非一切智者能測量其實。	非毘奈耶相應義理，非一切智者能測量其實。	037	It is not a matter of the principles of the Vinaya, and it cannot be measured by one who is not omniscient.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b22_4']	謂有何因，別解脫戒有於眾內執三衣等、禮眾求師、審問遮難、白四羯磨為先故得，或有但籍補特伽羅教命等緣為先故得，或有得戒不籍外緣，此等必應有決定理。	謂有何因，別解脫戒有於眾內執三衣等、禮眾求師、審問遮難、白四羯磨為先故得，或有但籍補特伽羅教命等緣為先故得，或有得戒不籍外緣，此等必應有決定理。	037	What is the reason that the prātimokṣa restraint is obtained by some in the assembly through taking the three robes, etc., requesting a teacher from the assembly, examining and asking about obstacles, and first performing the four announcements and karman, or by some only through the conditions of the instructions and commands of individual people, or by some who obtain the precepts without relying on external conditions? There must certainly be a definite principle for this.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b22_14']	佛知而說，非餘所量。	佛知而說，非餘所量。	037	The Buddha knows and speaks of it, and it cannot be measured by others.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b25_10']	又以何因造無間者，後雖悔愧修諸善業，於因果理能定信知，而於身中戒無容發，故佛遮彼出家受具，定知別有順受戒身。	又以何因造無間者，後雖悔愧修諸善業，於因果理能定信知，而於身中戒無容發，故佛遮彼出家受具，定知別有順受戒身。	037	Also, why is it that one who has committed a transgression with an immediately successive retribution, even though he later repents and cultivates good actions, is unable to generate morality in his person, even though he is able to believe and understand the principles of cause and effect? Therefore the Buddha prohibits him from leaving the home-life and receiving the precepts. It is definitely known that there is a separate body that accords with the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b27_7']	以受尸羅能救惡趣，非所受戒於無間生必定能招所應受果，亦非於後無招果能。	以受尸羅能救惡趣，非所受戒於無間生必定能招所應受果，亦非於後無招果能。	037	Because receiving morality can save one from evil destinies, but the precepts that are received cannot definitely attract the results that should be received in an immediately successive retribution. It is also not the case that later there is no ability to attract results.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b28_15']	又非彼人非佛悲境，理應定有律儀種性，唯依此處餘處不生。	又非彼人非佛悲境，理應定有律儀種性，唯依此處餘處不生。	037	Also, that person is not the object of the Buddha's compassion. It is reasonable that there definitely is a seed nature of moral discipline, and it only arises in this place, not in other places.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b29_6']	是故不應徵其所以。	是故不應徵其所以。	037	Therefore one should not question its reason.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551b29_11']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	037	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c01_17']	世尊覺知戒時邊際但有二種，一壽命邊際、二晝夜邊際。	世尊覺知戒時邊際但有二種，一壽命邊際、二晝夜邊際。	037	The World-Honored One realized that the limits of receiving precepts are only of two kinds: the limit of lifespan and the limit of day and night.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c02_15']	重說晝夜為半月等，故佛但說二受戒時。	重說晝夜為半月等，故佛但說二受戒時。	037	Day and night are repeatedly mentioned as half a month and so forth, therefore the Buddha only speaks of the two times for receiving precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c03_1']	何法名時？	何法名時？	037	What dharma is called time?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c04_4']	非離諸行，但光闇位四洲不同，如次應知立為晝夜。	非離諸行，但光闇位四洲不同，如次應知立為晝夜。	037	Apart from the formations, there is no difference in the light and dark periods in the four continents. One should understand that they are established as day and night in order.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c04_13']	此中經部作如是言：	此中經部作如是言：	037	Here, the Sautrāntika school says:
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c06_7']	二邊際中盡壽可爾，於命終後雖有要期，而不能生別解脫戒，依身別故。	二邊際中盡壽可爾，於命終後雖有要期，而不能生別解脫戒，依身別故。	037	It is possible to observe the precepts for one's whole life up to the two limits, but after death, even if one makes a vow, one cannot give rise to the precepts of liberation, because the basis of the body is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c07_1']	別依身中無加行故、無憶念故。	別依身中無加行故、無憶念故。	037	Because there is no preparatory effort in a different body and because there is no recollection.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c08_16']	一晝夜後或五或十晝夜等中受近住戒，何法為障令彼眾多近住律儀非亦得起？	一晝夜後或五或十晝夜等中受近住戒，何法為障令彼眾多近住律儀非亦得起？	037	After one day and night, or in five or ten days and nights, etc., one receives the precepts of the upavāsa. What dharma is the obstacle that prevents the arising of many upavāsa precepts?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c09_7']	彼如是說豈不違經？	彼如是說豈不違經？	037	If they say this, isn't it contrary to the sūtra?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c12_7']	遍覽諸經曾不見說過晝夜受近住律儀，汝等何緣以己劣慧貶量諸佛一切智境，數言五夜等受近住律儀，以佛經中唯說晝夜故。	遍覽諸經曾不見說過晝夜受近住律儀，汝等何緣以己劣慧貶量諸佛一切智境，數言五夜等受近住律儀，以佛經中唯說晝夜故。	037	Thoroughly examining all the sūtras, I have never seen it said that one receives the upavāsa precepts for more than a day and night. Why do you, with your inferior wisdom, measure the realm of omniscience of all buddhas and say that one receives the upavāsa precepts for five nights, etc.? Because in the Buddha's sūtras it is only said to be for a day and night.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c12_15']	對法者亦作是言：	對法者亦作是言：	037	The Abhidharma masters also say this:
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c14_13']	近住律儀唯晝夜受，必應有法能為障礙，令過晝夜彼戒不生，故佛經中唯說晝夜。	近住律儀唯晝夜受，必應有法能為障礙，令過晝夜彼戒不生，故佛經中唯說晝夜。	037	The precepts of the upavāsa are received only for a day and night, and there must be a principle that can serve as an obstacle, preventing the arising of those precepts after a day and night has passed. Therefore, the Buddha's sūtras only speak of a day and night.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c15_3']	然彼復說應共尋思：	然彼復說應共尋思：	037	However, they also say that we should investigate together:
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c16_11']	為佛正觀一晝夜後理無容起近住律儀，故於經中說一晝夜？	為佛正觀一晝夜後理無容起近住律儀，故於經中說一晝夜？	037	Did the Buddha see that it is impossible for the upavāsa precepts to arise after a day and night, and therefore speak of a day and night in the sūtras?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c17_11']	為觀所化根難調者，且應授與一晝夜戒？	為觀所化根難調者，且應授與一晝夜戒？	037	Or did he see that those to be converted whose faculties are difficult to tame should first be given the precepts for a day and night?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c18_1']	依何理教作如是言？	依何理教作如是言？	037	Based on what principle and teaching do you say this?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c18_19']	過此戒生不違理故，復減於此何理相違？	過此戒生不違理故，復減於此何理相違？	037	Because there is no contradiction in principle for the precepts to arise after this, and what principle is contradicted if they are reduced to less than this?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c21_6']	謂所化根有難調者，已許為說晝夜律儀，何不為調漸難調者，說唯一夜一晝須臾，以難調根有多品故。	謂所化根有難調者，已許為說晝夜律儀，何不為調漸難調者，說唯一夜一晝須臾，以難調根有多品故。	037	Those whose faculties are difficult to tame are already allowed to be taught the precepts for a day and night. Why not teach those whose faculties are gradually more difficult to tame only for one night, one day, or a short while? Because there are many levels of difficult faculties to tame.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c22_14']	由此知有近住定時，若減若增便不發戒，世尊觀見故唯說此。	由此知有近住定時，若減若增便不發戒，世尊觀見故唯說此。	037	From this we know that there is a fixed time for the upavāsa. If it is reduced or increased, the precepts will not arise. The World-Honored One saw this and therefore only spoke of this.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c23_13']	是故經部與正理師，無諍理中橫興諍論。	是故經部與正理師，無諍理中橫興諍論。	037	Therefore, the Sutra school and the orthodox masters, in a matter of non-disputation, give rise to disputation.
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c24_3']	依何邊際得不律儀？	依何邊際得不律儀？	037	On what basis does one obtain non-restraint?

['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c27_10']	所以者何？	所以者何？	037	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_037:0551c27_19']	以此非如善戒受故。	以此非如善戒受故。	037	Because this is not like the proper acceptance of precepts.
