['ZH_T36_1739_005:0746c27_0']	十方佛所以同名，為此十住法證聖位法流，已	十方佛所以同名，為此十住法證聖位法流，已	005	The reason the Buddhas of the ten directions have the same name is that for this stage of the ten abodes, the Dharma of realizing the holy stage flows,
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0746c28_13']	入法界大海，同佛聖位智慧故。	入法界大海，同佛聖位智慧故。	005	having already entered the great ocean of the Dharma realm, the same as the holy stage and wisdom of the Buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0746c29_11']	是以佛與法慧菩薩名同，為表法同故。	是以佛與法慧菩薩名同，為表法同故。	005	Therefore, the Buddha and the Bodhisattva Dharma Wisdom have the same name, in order to express the same Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a01_3']	又明十住法門因果齊故。	又明十住法門因果齊故。	005	It also clarifies that the cause and effect of the Dharma door of the ten abodes are equal.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a02_4']	佛位果德，菩薩為因，因與果體不異，是故同名。	佛位果德，菩薩為因，因與果體不異，是故同名。	005	The fruition virtues of the Buddha stage are the cause of the bodhisattvas, and the essence of the cause and effect is non-dual, which is why they have the same name.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a05_13']	說此十住法時，昇須彌山頂上，有六品經，共成十住法門之行相，一〈昇須彌山頂品〉、二〈偈讚品〉、三〈十住品〉、四〈梵行品〉、五〈初發心功德品〉、六〈明法品〉。	說此十住法時，昇須彌山頂上，有六品經，共成十住法門之行相，一〈昇須彌山頂品〉、二〈偈讚品〉、三〈十住品〉、四〈梵行品〉、五〈初發心功德品〉、六〈明法品〉。	005	When expounding this Dharma of the ten abodes, ascending to the summit of Mount Sumeru, there are six chapters of sutra that together form the characteristics of the practice of the Dharma door of the ten abodes: 1. Chapter on Ascending to the Summit of Mount Sumeru, 2. Chapter on Verses of Praise, 3. Chapter on the Ten Abodes, 4. Chapter on Pure Conduct, 5. Chapter on the Merits of the First Aspiration for Enlightenment, 6. Chapter on Illuminating the Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a07_12']	且依此六品經中解行法門修學悟入，必能成就十住法門，住佛種性、生如來家，為真佛子。	且依此六品經中解行法門修學悟入，必能成就十住法門，住佛種性、生如來家，為真佛子。	005	Relying on the practice and understanding of the six chapters of this sutra, one can definitely accomplish the Dharma gates of the ten abodes, abide in the Buddha's lineage, be born in the Tathāgata's family, and become a true son of the Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a08_17']	不同權教初地菩薩始生佛家，或說三賢菩薩以誓願成佛。	不同權教初地菩薩始生佛家，或說三賢菩薩以誓願成佛。	005	This is different from the provisional teachings, where bodhisattvas at the first ground are said to be newly born in the Buddha's family, or where it is said that bodhisattvas at the three stages of worthiness become Buddhas through vows.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a12_9']	此《華嚴經》直論實證位，不論誓願，為此教門總一時一際法界無異念，前後情絕、凡聖一性，不論情繫，應以無念無作法界門照之可見，若立情見，不可信也。	此《華嚴經》直論實證位，不論誓願，為此教門總一時一際法界無異念，前後情絕、凡聖一性，不論情繫，應以無念無作法界門照之可見，若立情見，不可信也。	005	This Flower Ornament Sutra directly discusses the stages of true realization, not vows. For this teaching, the Dharma realm of one time and one moment is without different thoughts, the feelings of before and after are cut off, and the one nature of ordinary beings and sages is not discussed in terms of emotional attachments. It should be illuminated by the Dharma gate of the inconceivable and effortless Dharma realm. If one establishes emotional views, it cannot be believed.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a13_4']	設生信者，玄信佛語，故非是自見。	設生信者，玄信佛語，故非是自見。	005	Even if one gives rise to faith, it is profound faith in the Buddha's words, and therefore not one's own understanding.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a14_13']	若自見者，唯情絕想亡，心與理合、智與境冥，方知萬境性相通收。	若自見者，唯情絕想亡，心與理合、智與境冥，方知萬境性相通收。	005	If it were one's own understanding, only when thoughts and emotions are cut off, and mind merges with principle, and wisdom merges with the realm, can one know that the nature and characteristics of the myriad realms are universally included.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a15_13']	若不如斯，心常彼此，是非競作，垢淨何休？	若不如斯，心常彼此，是非競作，垢淨何休？	005	If one does not do it this way, the mind will always be caught up in this and that, disputes over right and wrong will be made, and how can defilement and purity ever cease?
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a18_17']	若也稱性情亡，法界重玄之門自達，一多純雜自在含容，總別之門圓融自在，於利生之法善達諸根，隨所堪能悉皆成益，敬承親近者皆能友之。	若也稱性情亡，法界重玄之門自達，一多純雜自在含容，總別之門圓融自在，於利生之法善達諸根，隨所堪能悉皆成益，敬承親近者皆能友之。	005	If one accords with the nature and the mind is extinguished, then the gate of the profound Dharma realm will naturally be penetrated. One and many, pure and mixed, freely contain each other. The gate of totality and particularity is perfectly fused and free. In the Dharma of benefiting beings, one skillfully understands the faculties of all, and according to their abilities, all will attain benefit. Those who respect, follow, and draw near are all able to be friends.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a20_19']	如昇夜摩天宮說〈十行品〉，及如來於兩足上放百千妙色光明，為表依空建行，始可理事自在。	如昇夜摩天宮說〈十行品〉，及如來於兩足上放百千妙色光明，為表依空建行，始可理事自在。	005	Like ascending to the Heaven of Yāma and expounding the Chapter on Ten Practices, and like the Tathāgata emitting a hundred thousand sublime lights from the soles of his feet, it is to illustrate that relying on emptiness to establish practices can begin to freely accord with principle and phenomena.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a22_13']	明十住之位證法身本智，十行之位以法身根本智無礙方行萬行，行亦無礙。	明十住之位證法身本智，十行之位以法身根本智無礙方行萬行，行亦無礙。	005	It clarifies that the stage of ten abodes realizes the fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body, and the stage of ten practices uses the unobstructed myriad practices based on the fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body. The practices are also unobstructed.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a24_3']	若不見法身本智，所行萬行皆屬人天因果，皆為有漏生滅之福。	若不見法身本智，所行萬行皆屬人天因果，皆為有漏生滅之福。	005	If one does not see the fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body, the myriad practices one engages in all belong to the causes and effects of humans and gods, and are all contaminated meritorious virtues of birth and cessation.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747a29_15']	以法身自智慧用治諸惑，以萬行悲濟眾生，法身智身任無作大悲一時頓用，雖寄七地悲增、八地智增之行相，此華嚴法界門十住初位，總該諸位在十住初門，位同佛果，為一法界體用故，以一位中具十波羅蜜諸十法故，以諸法重玄門照之可見。	以法身自智慧用治諸惑，以萬行悲濟眾生，法身智身任無作大悲一時頓用，雖寄七地悲增、八地智增之行相，此華嚴法界門十住初位，總該諸位在十住初門，位同佛果，為一法界體用故，以一位中具十波羅蜜諸十法故，以諸法重玄門照之可見。	005	Using the wisdom of the Dharma body to eliminate afflictions and with myriad practices of compassion to save sentient beings, the Dharma body and wisdom body spontaneously function with great compassion simultaneously and universally. Although it relies on the characteristics of increased compassion in the seventh ground and increased wisdom in the eighth ground, this is the Dharma realm gate of the Flower Ornament Sutra, where the initial stage of the ten abodes encompasses all stages. Being in the initial gate of the ten abodes is the same as the fruition of Buddhahood, because it is the essence and function of the single Dharma realm. Because each stage is endowed with the ten perfections and the ten dharmas, one can see it by illuminating it with the profound gate of the interpenetration of all dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b02_14']	此乃總是如來藏身普賢菩薩世界海漩法門，此乃如日月照臨，盲者不見，非日月咎。	此乃總是如來藏身普賢菩薩世界海漩法門，此乃如日月照臨，盲者不見，非日月咎。	005	This is the Dharma gate of the whirlpool of the ocean of worlds of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, the body of the Tathāgata's treasury. This is like the sun and moon shining, but the blind do not see it, which is not the fault of the sun and moon.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b03_11']	應自責躬修德，可以頂敬以定慧觀之。	應自責躬修德，可以頂敬以定慧觀之。	005	One should blame oneself for not cultivating virtue and can pay respect with samādhi and prajñā contemplation.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b04_16']	如來藏身者，則法身也，諸福智海莫不居中，故稱為藏。	如來藏身者，則法身也，諸福智海莫不居中，故稱為藏。	005	The body of the Tathāgata's treasury is the Dharma body, and all oceans of blessings and wisdom are not apart from it, thus it is called the treasury.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b06_1']	若不見法身，一切福智大慈大悲悉皆不辦，總屬生滅。	若不見法身，一切福智大慈大悲悉皆不辦，總屬生滅。	005	If one does not see the Dharma body, all merits, wisdom, great compassion, and great mercy will not be accomplished, and all belong to birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b08_9']	世界海漩者，悲智觀根，屈曲徹俗身土及業，重重眾生、重重諸業，各別大悲普救，根無不盡故，名之曰海漩。	世界海漩者，悲智觀根，屈曲徹俗身土及業，重重眾生、重重諸業，各別大悲普救，根無不盡故，名之曰海漩。	005	As for the whirlpool of the ocean of worlds, with compassion and wisdom observing faculties, the body and land penetrating the mundane world with twists and turns, and the various karmas of sentient beings, the great compassion of each and every one universally saving, with faculties inexhaustible, it is therefore called the whirlpool of the ocean.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b08_19']	漩者，甚深漩澓義也。	漩者，甚深漩澓義也。	005	A whirlpool means the meaning of a very deep vortex.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b11_4']	像此佛果位中菩薩，一入法界之門，攝重重眾生根業盡故，無出世心，永沒生死大海漩流，無出沒故。	像此佛果位中菩薩，一入法界之門，攝重重眾生根業盡故，無出世心，永沒生死大海漩流，無出沒故。	005	Like this, in the fruition stage of a buddha, a bodhisattva enters one gate of the Dharma realm, and because it encompasses the faculties and karmas of sentient beings, without the mind of leaving the world, one forever sinks in the vortex of the great ocean of birth and death, without emerging.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b13_13']	此十行門同普賢行，前十住門同文殊師利法身根本無相智慧，二人齊體互為主伴，中間無作智即為佛果。	此十行門同普賢行，前十住門同文殊師利法身根本無相智慧，二人齊體互為主伴，中間無作智即為佛果。	005	These ten stages of practice are the same as Samantabhadra's practices. The previous ten stages of abiding are the same as Mañjuśrī's fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body without characteristics. The two people's essence is the same, mutually serving as the host and companion. The effortless wisdom in the middle becomes the fruition of buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b14_8']	三人體一，寄安五位，用接凡迷。	三人體一，寄安五位，用接凡迷。	005	The essence of the three people is one, provisionally abiding in the five stages, using this to connect with ordinary deluded beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b18_9']	若有凡夫信滿發心，十住之初三身同德，文殊是佛法身、普賢是佛行身、無作之智果是佛報身，常以文殊法身無相妙慧以為先導，說時先後證則三身一時，法合如是，廢一不可。	若有凡夫信滿發心，十住之初三身同德，文殊是佛法身、普賢是佛行身、無作之智果是佛報身，常以文殊法身無相妙慧以為先導，說時先後證則三身一時，法合如是，廢一不可。	005	If there are ordinary beings who fully believe and give rise to the aspiration, at the beginning of the ten abodes, the three bodies share the same virtue. Mañjuśrī is the Dharma body of the Buddha, Samantabhadra is the body of the Buddha's practices, and the fruition of non-active wisdom is the reward body of the Buddha. Always using Mañjuśrī's formless wondrous wisdom of the Dharma body as the forerunner, when speaking, the earlier and later realizations are the three bodies at one time. The Dharma is combined like this, and one cannot be omitted.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b19_5']	若廢文殊存普賢，所有行門屬有漏；	若廢文殊存普賢，所有行門屬有漏；	005	If Mañjuśrī is omitted and only Samantabhadra is retained, all the practices belong to the contaminated.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b20_2']	若廢普賢存文殊，所證寂定是二乘；	若廢普賢存文殊，所證寂定是二乘；	005	If Samantabhadra is omitted and only Mañjuśrī is retained, the realized tranquil concentration is the two vehicles.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b21_1']	若廢佛存文殊普賢，佛是覺義，無覺者故。	若廢佛存文殊普賢，佛是覺義，無覺者故。	005	If the Buddha is omitted and only Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra are retained, the Buddha is the meaning of enlightenment, because there is no one who is enlightened.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b22_1']	以是義故，三人不可廢一，若廢一三不成故。	以是義故，三人不可廢一，若廢一三不成故。	005	For this reason, the three people cannot omit one, because if one is omitted, the three are not accomplished.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b24_10']	是故三乘權教中，無此三人始終不相去離，以教門未實總是化身，權逐小根且略權施，待其熟故方遷就實。	是故三乘權教中，無此三人始終不相去離，以教門未實總是化身，權逐小根且略權施，待其熟故方遷就實。	005	Therefore, in the provisional teachings of the Three Vehicles, these three types of people are always together from beginning to end, because the teaching methods are not yet real and are all the transformation body. The provisional teachings are temporarily established for those of small capacity, waiting for them to mature before gradually transitioning to the real.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b25_5']	如《法華》、《涅槃》總是漸漸遷向實教。	如《法華》、《涅槃》總是漸漸遷向實教。	005	Like the Lotus Sutra and Nirvana Sutra, they all gradually transition towards the real teachings.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747b27_3']	如此經十住中初位，即是十行、十迴向、十地、等覺位，總得其初及得其終，互相貫通。	如此經十住中初位，即是十行、十迴向、十地、等覺位，總得其初及得其終，互相貫通。	005	In this sutra, the first stage of the ten abodes is the ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and the stage of enlightenment. They all attain the beginning and the end, penetrating each other.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c01_9']	一位中得五十法門，以互相徹故，一一位中二千五百總別之義齊現，乃至無盡諸位地等進修行相層級，不廢漸漸而是一時、不廢一時中漸漸。	一位中得五十法門，以互相徹故，一一位中二千五百總別之義齊現，乃至無盡諸位地等進修行相層級，不廢漸漸而是一時、不廢一時中漸漸。	005	In each stage, fifty dharma gates are attained, because they penetrate each other. In each stage, the total and specific meanings of two thousand five hundred are equally present, up to the endless stages and grounds, etc. The progressive aspects of practice are not abandoned, yet they are simultaneous. Not abandoning the simultaneous, yet within the simultaneous there is gradual progression.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c03_7']	此十行位中隨其十方，各有一大菩薩來至佛所，各將十佛剎微塵數菩薩而來集會。	此十行位中隨其十方，各有一大菩薩來至佛所，各將十佛剎微塵數菩薩而來集會。	005	In this stage of ten practices, following the ten directions, there is a great bodhisattva who comes to where the Buddha is, each leading bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in a buddha-land to gather for the assembly.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c04_4']	十箇上首菩薩，下名悉同，名之為林。	十箇上首菩薩，下名悉同，名之為林。	005	The ten foremost bodhisattvas below all have the same name, called forest.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c04_19']	本從來國，下名悉同，名之為慧。	本從來國，下名悉同，名之為慧。	005	The name of the country from which they originally came is the same below, called wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c05_13']	本所事佛，下名悉同，名之為眼。	本所事佛，下名悉同，名之為眼。	005	The buddha they originally served is the same below, called eye.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c06_9']	十箇上首菩薩，下名悉同，名之為林。	十箇上首菩薩，下名悉同，名之為林。	005	The ten foremost bodhisattvas below all have the same name, called forest.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c06_15']	林者有五德：	林者有五德：	005	Forest has five virtues:
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c09_5']	一建立德、二身幹枝條緣互相生無生德、三華葉果實成益德、四能障炎暑得清涼德、五人龍鳥獸鬼神所歸德。	一建立德、二身幹枝條緣互相生無生德、三華葉果實成益德、四能障炎暑得清涼德、五人龍鳥獸鬼神所歸德。	005	First, the virtue of establishment; second, the virtue of mutual arising without arising of the main trunk and branches; third, the virtue of benefiting from flowers, leaves, and fruits; fourth, the virtue of being able to block the scorching heat and obtain coolness; fifth, the virtue of being the refuge of humans, dragons, birds, beasts, and spirits.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c10_6']	一何謂建立德？	一何謂建立德？	005	What is the virtue of establishment?
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c11_5']	謂如大林，內有龍神所居，外無大風所折。	謂如大林，內有龍神所居，外無大風所折。	005	It refers to a great forest, within which dragons and spirits reside, and outside of which there is no great wind that can break it.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c11_19']	若不如是，不得建立高顯成林。	若不如是，不得建立高顯成林。	005	If it were not so, it would not be established as tall and prominent, forming a forest.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c13_10']	為明此位菩薩，內有大智之龍，常以大慈悲神而自守護，了境內寂；	為明此位菩薩，內有大智之龍，常以大慈悲神而自守護，了境內寂；	005	To clarify that in this stage the bodhisattva internally has the great wisdom dragon, always protecting himself with great compassion and spirit, and understanding the inner tranquility of objects;
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c14_13']	外無色塵境風所折，異道邪論以智摧之，無能所伐。	外無色塵境風所折，異道邪論以智摧之，無能所伐。	005	Externally, he is not swayed by the winds of form and dust objects, and with wisdom he subdues the heterodox views and false doctrines, with nothing that can be cut down.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c14_18']	而建萬行。	而建萬行。	005	And he establishes myriad practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c15_19']	與一切眾生皆共同之，常為利益故，為建立德。	與一切眾生皆共同之，常為利益故，為建立德。	005	He shares them with all sentient beings, always for the sake of benefiting them, and thus establishes virtue.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c16_14']	二何謂身幹枝條緣互相生無生德？	二何謂身幹枝條緣互相生無生德？	005	Second, what is meant by the virtue of mutual arising without arising of the trunk and branches of the body?
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c18_4']	為明樹身幹枝條上各各求能生所生性了不可得，但為緣生。	為明樹身幹枝條上各各求能生所生性了不可得，但為緣生。	005	To clarify that the trunk and branches of the tree body each seek the nature of that which can give rise to and that which is given rise to, but it cannot be found. It is merely arising from conditions.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c19_7']	緣生之法，緣緣無所生，本來不生生、本來生不生。	緣生之法，緣緣無所生，本來不生生、本來生不生。	005	The dharma of arising from conditions, the conditions and objects of conditions have nothing that arises. Originally non-arising arises, and originally arising does not arise.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c20_2']	為明此位菩薩所行，行無盡門故。	為明此位菩薩所行，行無盡門故。	005	To clarify that the practices carried out by the bodhisattva in this stage are the gateway of inexhaustible practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c22_3']	為以法身本智為先導故，常行萬行，於身於境求能行所行了不可得，但以法如是行故。	為以法身本智為先導故，常行萬行，於身於境求能行所行了不可得，但以法如是行故。	005	It is because the fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body is taken as the forerunner, always practicing myriad practices. In terms of the body and objects, the one who practices and the practiced are unobtainable. It is only because the Dharma is like this that it is practiced.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c23_10']	三何謂華葉果實成益德？	三何謂華葉果實成益德？	005	Third, what is meant by the virtue of benefiting through the formation of flowers, leaves, and fruits?
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c25_9']	謂如樹林華敷可觀令人愛樂，葉能映障炎熱令得清涼，果實資養眾生飢渴者皆充足。	謂如樹林華敷可觀令人愛樂，葉能映障炎熱令得清涼，果實資養眾生飢渴者皆充足。	005	It is like a forest whose blooming flowers are delightful to behold, whose leaves provide shade and coolness, and whose fruits nourish sentient beings, satisfying those who are hungry and thirsty.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c26_8']	為明此位菩薩常行萬行，令人天樂見；	為明此位菩薩常行萬行，令人天樂見；	005	It clarifies that the bodhisattvas of this stage always practice myriad practices, causing humans and gods to delight in seeing them;
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c27_3']	廣布大慈悲之葉，令人親而不捨；	廣布大慈悲之葉，令人親而不捨；	005	They spread the leaves of great compassion, causing people to be close to them without abandoning them;
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0747c28_5']	施大智之果充足法界眾生，皆令滿足本願方終。	施大智之果充足法界眾生，皆令滿足本願方終。	005	They bestow the fruit of great wisdom, satisfying sentient beings in the Dharma realm, causing them all to fulfill their original vows before ending.

Therefore, this chapter on the culmination of the path and fruition within the ten grounds penetrates to the beginning.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0750a12_3']	前光舉果勸修，後十地放光明自修至果，是故光明名菩薩力。	前光舉果勸修，後十地放光明自修至果，是故光明名菩薩力。	005	Previously, the light raised the fruition as an encouragement to practice, and later, the ten grounds emit light, practicing on their own until reaching fruition. Therefore, the light is called the power of the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0750a13_17']	以菩薩修自精勤力、無退轉力、不懈怠力，而能修習至此十地如來法界藏故。	以菩薩修自精勤力、無退轉力、不懈怠力，而能修習至此十地如來法界藏故。	005	Because the bodhisattvas cultivate with the power of their own diligence, the power of irreversibility, and the power of non-slacking, they are able to practice and reach these ten grounds and the Tathāgata's Dharma realm treasury.

The intention is to distinguish the correct path and the auxiliary path, so thirty-seven bodhisattvas are established to form the thirty-seven auxiliary path Dharma gates, not the correct fruition.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0750a22_1']	十住以來菩薩，所行皆是助道，非是正位故。	十住以來菩薩，所行皆是助道，非是正位故。	005	The bodhisattvas' practices since the ten abodes are all auxiliary paths, not the correct stage.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0750a23_9']	意欲明行所行者是為助道，無住無行任真自體名之為正果故。	意欲明行所行者是為助道，無住無行任真自體名之為正果故。	005	The intention is to clarify that what is practiced is the auxiliary path, and the unconditioned true essence itself without abiding or practice is called the correct fruition.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0750a25_10']	若以初發心住，以法性無相根本智不離無作用之體行諸萬行，菩薩與佛因果本來體齊。	若以初發心住，以法性無相根本智不離無作用之體行諸萬行，菩薩與佛因果本來體齊。	005	If, from the initial stage of generating the mind, one uses the formless fundamental wisdom of the nature of dharmas to practice the myriad practices without departing from the essence of non-action, the bodhisattva and the Buddha are originally equal in terms of cause and effect.

The eyebrows and eyes cannot but be distinguished.

The thirty-seven who are called treasuries are the thirty-seven bodhisattvas, and the one who is called Moon of Liberation is by himself alone.
['ZH_T36_1739_005:0750b12_5']	何故同名為藏者？	何故同名為藏者？	005	Why are those who are called treasuries the same?

Only the one bodhisattva Moon of Liberation is alone the companion, clarifying that he is not of the same Dharma assembly, so a separate name is established.

In the stage of the ten abodes, Vajra Banner Bodhisattva entered the bodhisattvas' samadhi of wisdom light. Now, in this stage of the ten grounds, Vajra Treasury Bodhisattva entered the bodhisattvas' samadhi of great wisdom light. Because in this stage, the bodhisattvas' wisdom and illumination increase, and their wondrous functioning and discernment increase and become even more illuminated. He further adds wisdom. This is because the Dharma doors of each stage become increasingly superior. However, the other stages are not without the functioning of wisdom.

['ZH_T36_1739_005:0753a09_4']	如《佛名經》，無量聲如來、日月光明如來，世尊偏增致敬，重加三禮，云滅罪多者，如來方便引凡心生令策志故。	如《佛名經》，無量聲如來、日月光明如來，世尊偏增致敬，重加三禮，云滅罪多者，如來方便引凡心生令策志故。	005	As the Buddha-name Sūtra says, the Tathāgata of Immeasurable Sounds and the Tathāgata of Sun and Moon Light, the World-Honored One specially increases respect and adds three prostrations. Saying that the one who destroys more sins is the Tathāgata's skillful means to attract the ordinary mind to generate and encourage aspiration.

['ZH_T36_1739_005:0753a13_12']	今時佛果中諸菩薩安立地位境界增廣，如是漸次言千佛世界萬佛世界，乃至數終，一一數體緣起相徹，一一數中始終相入無前後際，是諸佛密意方便故。	今時佛果中諸菩薩安立地位境界增廣，如是漸次言千佛世界萬佛世界，乃至數終，一一數體緣起相徹，一一數中始終相入無前後際，是諸佛密意方便故。	005	Now, in the fruition of Buddhahood, the bodhisattvas establish the stages and the realm expands. In this way, the gradual sequence speaks of the worlds of a thousand Buddhas, the worlds of ten thousand Buddhas, and so forth, up to the end of counting. The essence of each number is interpenetrated with the characteristics of dependent origination. In each number, the beginning and end mutually enter without a front or back limit. This is because it is the secret skillful means of all Buddhas.

Still, using the same nature, the same time, and dependent origination at the same time, therefore, the Dharma gate of establishing the realm is like this.
