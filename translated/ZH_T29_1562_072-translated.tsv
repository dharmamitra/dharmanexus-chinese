['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730b20_17']	且見道位見三諦時，一一唯得法戒證淨，見道諦位兼得佛僧，謂見苦時得聖愛戒及法證淨。	且見道位見三諦時，一一唯得法戒證淨，見道諦位兼得佛僧，謂見苦時得聖愛戒及法證淨。	072	When one sees the three truths, one obtains only the purity of Dharma and morality. When one sees the truth of the path, one also obtains the purity of Buddha and Sangha. When one sees suffering, one obtains the morality loved by the noble ones and the purity of Dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730b21_11']	於何等法如何而得法證淨耶？	於何等法如何而得法證淨耶？	072	With regard to what dharmas and how does one obtain the purity of Dharma?

One gives rise to definitive faith. In this way, in the stage of seeing the truth of the origin, one also only obtains the two purities as before. One understands that only the dharmas of the origin are able to be the cause of suffering, and there is no inner person. One gives rise to definitive faith. From this, without interval, when one sees the truth of cessation, one also only obtains the two purities as before. One understands that only the dharmas of cessation are the true nirvana, and it is truly worth pursuing. One gives rise to definitive faith. From this, subsequently, when one sees the truth of the path, one also obtains the two purities of Buddha and Sangha. One obtains the purity of Buddha with regard to the dharmas of the non-learners in the continuum of Buddha. One obtains the purity of Sangha with regard to the dharmas of learners and non-learners in the continuum of Sangha.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c01_13']	兼言為顯見道諦時，亦得聖戒及法證淨，達唯道法是證滅因、誠可遵求，生決定信。	兼言為顯見道諦時，亦得聖戒及法證淨，達唯道法是證滅因、誠可遵求，生決定信。	072	The word “also” is used to indicate that at the time of seeing the truth of the path, one also obtains the holy precepts and the purity of Dharma. One understands that only the Dharma of the path is the cause of realizing cessation, and one gives rise to definite faith.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c02_19']	然所信法略有二種，一別、二總，總通四諦，別唯三諦全。	然所信法略有二種，一別、二總，總通四諦，別唯三諦全。	072	However, the Dharma that is believed in is roughly of two kinds: specific and general. The general is common to the four truths, while the specific is only the three truths in their entirety.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c04_2']	菩薩獨覺道，菩薩道者唯有學法，獨覺道者通學無學。	菩薩獨覺道，菩薩道者唯有學法，獨覺道者通學無學。	072	The path of the bodhisattva and pratyekabuddha, the path of the bodhisattva only consists of the dharmas of training, while the path of the pratyekabuddha is common to both training and no training.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c06_17']	若無漏信緣別法生，名不雜緣於法證淨，若無漏信兼緣佛僧名為雜緣於法證淨，故見三諦唯得二種，見道諦時具足得四。	若無漏信緣別法生，名不雜緣於法證淨，若無漏信兼緣佛僧名為雜緣於法證淨，故見三諦唯得二種，見道諦時具足得四。	072	If pure faith arises in relation to specific dharmas, it is called the purity of Dharma with specific objects. If pure faith is also in relation to the Buddha and Saṅgha, it is called the purity of Dharma with mixed objects. Therefore, when seeing the three truths, one only obtains two kinds. When seeing the truth of the path, one fully obtains the four.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c07_15']	見道諦位為於現前得佛法僧三證淨不？	見道諦位為於現前得佛法僧三證淨不？	072	At the stage of seeing the truth of the path, does one obtain the three purities of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha in the present?
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c08_15']	非皆現得，見道諦時現行總緣諸道諦故。	非皆現得，見道諦時現行總緣諸道諦故。	072	Not all are presently obtained, because at the time of seeing the truth of the path, one generally contemplates the various truths of the path in the present.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c10_4']	應知現在唯有雜緣一法證淨，乘此勢力修得未來多剎那信。	應知現在唯有雜緣一法證淨，乘此勢力修得未來多剎那信。	072	You should know that in the present there is only the impure one pure faith that takes one dharma as object, and by the power of this, one cultivates and acquires many moments of faith in the future.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c12_2']	於中有別緣佛法僧，或有總緣二三寶者，諸別緣者名三證淨，諸總緣者法證淨攝。	於中有別緣佛法僧，或有總緣二三寶者，諸別緣者名三證淨，諸總緣者法證淨攝。	072	Among these, there are those that take the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha as separate objects, and those that take two or three treasures as their general object. Those that take them separately are called the three pure faiths, and those that take them generally are included in the pure faith in the Dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c13_1']	道類智時修八智故，亦得三諦法戒二種。	道類智時修八智故，亦得三諦法戒二種。	072	At the time of the knowledge of the species of the path, one cultivates eight knowledges, and therefore also acquires the two kinds of Dharma and precepts of the three truths.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c14_17']	道法忍等三剎那中，未來唯修道諦四種，由所信別故名有四，應知實事唯有二種。	道法忍等三剎那中，未來唯修道諦四種，由所信別故名有四，應知實事唯有二種。	072	In the three moments of the receptivity to the knowledge of the Dharma of the path, etc., in the future one only cultivates the four kinds of truth of the path, which are called the four kinds due to the difference in what is believed, but one should know that in reality there are only two kinds.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c16_7']	謂於佛等三種證淨以信為體，聖戒證淨以戒為體，故唯有二。	謂於佛等三種證淨以信為體，聖戒證淨以戒為體，故唯有二。	072	That is, the three kinds of pure faith in the Buddha, etc. take faith as their essence, and the pure faith in the holy precepts takes precepts as their essence, and therefore there are only two.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c17_7']	若七支戒實唯一者，如何覺分中實事有十一？	若七支戒實唯一者，如何覺分中實事有十一？	072	If the seven kinds of precepts are really only one, how is it that in the factors of enlightenment there are eleven real entities?
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c18_16']	應唯有十種，或十六或多，以覺分中身語二業說有差別及相有異。	應唯有十種，或十六或多，以覺分中身語二業說有差別及相有異。	072	There should be only ten kinds, or sixteen or more, because in the factors of enlightenment, the two karmas of body and speech are said to have differences and different characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c19_16']	正命一種雖有別說，離身語業無別體相。	正命一種雖有別說，離身語業無別體相。	072	Although right livelihood is mentioned separately, apart from bodily and verbal action it has no separate essence.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c20_15']	依有別相，前覺分中說言實事有十一種。	依有別相，前覺分中說言實事有十一種。	072	Based on the fact that it has a separate characteristic, the former chapter on enlightenment factors says that there are eleven real entities.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c21_20']	雖身語業一一有多，然種類同，故各立一，如四念住。	雖身語業一一有多，然種類同，故各立一，如四念住。	072	Although bodily and verbal action each has many kinds, their types are the same, and therefore each is established as one, just as in the case of the four foundations of mindfulness.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c23_17']	前三證淨謂慧與信，若不雜緣隨所緣別，雖有多種而類同故，各立為一，此亦應然。	前三證淨謂慧與信，若不雜緣隨所緣別，雖有多種而類同故，各立為一，此亦應然。	072	The first three purities are wisdom and faith. If they are not mixed in their objects, they are distinguished according to their objects. Although there are many kinds, their types are the same, and therefore each is established as one. This should be the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c25_10']	今證淨中依身語業聖戒相等，及契經中同說不缺、不穿等故總立為一。	今證淨中依身語業聖戒相等，及契經中同說不缺、不穿等故總立為一。	072	Now, in the purities, the holy precepts are distinguished according to bodily and verbal action, etc., and the same is said in the scriptures about being unbroken and unpunctured, etc. Therefore, they are established as one in total.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c26_17']	隨身語業類別分二，聖戒相同總立為一，故二與一無相違過。	隨身語業類別分二，聖戒相同總立為一，故二與一無相違過。	072	Distinguishing according to the different types of bodily and verbal action, they are divided into two. The holy precepts are the same and are established as one in total. Therefore, there is no error in contradiction between two and one.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c27_7']	為依何義立證淨名？	為依何義立證淨名？	072	On what meaning is the name purity of cognition established?
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0730c29_5']	如實覺知四聖諦理故名為證，正信三寶及妙尸羅俱名為淨，由證得淨立證淨名。	如實覺知四聖諦理故名為證，正信三寶及妙尸羅俱名為淨，由證得淨立證淨名。	072	Because one realizes and understands the principle of the four noble truths, it is called realization. Correct faith in the Three Jewels and the wonderful precepts are both called purity. Because one realizes and attains purity, the name realization and purity is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0731a01_13']	正信是心清淨相攝可名為淨，尸羅不是清淨相攝，寧立淨名？	正信是心清淨相攝可名為淨，尸羅不是清淨相攝，寧立淨名？	072	Correct faith is the characteristic of the purity of the mind and can be called purity. The precepts are not the characteristic of purity, so how can they be established as purity?
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0731a02_13']	此四皆是清淨相攝，離不信垢、破戒垢故。	此四皆是清淨相攝，離不信垢、破戒垢故。	072	These four are all the characteristic of purity, because they are free from the defilement of lack of faith and the defilement of breaking the precepts.

['ZH_T29_1562_072:0731a05_8']	餘三以佛為根本故，佛於正說有功能故，於彼證淨立在最初；	餘三以佛為根本故，佛於正說有功能故，於彼證淨立在最初；	072	Because the other three have the Buddha as their root, because the Buddha has the function of correct teaching, the realization and purity in him is established as the first.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0731a06_7']	正說功能由悟法故，於彼證淨立為第二；	正說功能由悟法故，於彼證淨立為第二；	072	The function of correct teaching is due to the realization of the Dharma, so the realization and purity in that is established as the second.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0731a07_6']	現觀法藏唯聖僧故，於彼證淨立為第三；	現觀法藏唯聖僧故，於彼證淨立為第三；	072	Because the treasury of the Dharma realized by the noble Sangha is only the noble Sangha, the realization and purity in that is established as the third.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0731a08_5']	觀法藏能依聖戒故，聖戒證淨立在最後。	觀法藏能依聖戒故，聖戒證淨立在最後。	072	Because one observes the precepts that are the basis of the treasury of the Dharma, the realization and purity of the noble precepts is established as the last.

['ZH_T29_1562_072:0734b06_3']	雖斷餘結所得義中，契經亦言是離是滅，然離滅名別目前二，故於此義唯說斷聲。	雖斷餘結所得義中，契經亦言是離是滅，然離滅名別目前二，故於此義唯說斷聲。	072	Even though the scriptures also say in the meaning of the acquisition of the cessation of other bonds that it is separation and it is extinction, still, the words separation and extinction are different from the two mentioned above, and therefore in this meaning only the word cessation is used.

The three realms are thus really distinct, but they are established as one nature of nirvana in combination. Therefore it is said that the three realms are mutually inclusive.

However, this scripture says that they are all to be extinguished and abandoned, and therefore we know that this scripture speaks with a special intention.

Do not say that the realm of cessation is the essence of the two realms. The noble path should also be a matter to be abandoned, because the matter to be abandoned is only the object of craving.

Just as form, etc. are called abandoned because of the abandonment of craving, so they should also be called separated because of separation from craving, and called extinguished because of the extinction of craving. This means that only in terms of the complete abandonment of craving is abandonment, separation, and extinction spoken of.

The realm of cessation should contain the realm of elimination and separation. In this way, the three realms should be without distinction.

The thought of separation is the thought that one is presently cutting off in the stage of separation from passion. The thought of extinction is the thought that one has already cut off in the stage of having already accomplished the task.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0734c18_11']	或於已受蘊重擔中，見不捨過起欲捨想名為斷想，以捨與斷名差別故。	或於已受蘊重擔中，見不捨過起欲捨想名為斷想，以捨與斷名差別故。	072	Or, in the case of the aggregates that one has already accepted as a heavy burden, one sees the fault of not abandoning them and generates the thought of abandoning them, called the thought of cutting off, because abandoning and cutting off are different names for the same thing.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0734c20_4']	若於餘蘊不復生中見勝功德起欲求想名為滅想，不生與滅名差別故。	若於餘蘊不復生中見勝功德起欲求想名為滅想，不生與滅名差別故。	072	If one sees the excellent qualities of not being born again in the case of the other aggregates, one generates the thought of seeking non-birth, called the thought of extinction, because non-birth and extinction are different names for the same thing.
['ZH_T29_1562_072:0734c22_6']	既得離染清淨相續，於諸蘊法無所顧戀，於般涅槃見靜妙想名為離想，無戀與離名差別故。	既得離染清淨相續，於諸蘊法無所顧戀，於般涅槃見靜妙想名為離想，無戀與離名差別故。	072	Having already attained separation from passion and a pure continuum, one has no concern for the dharmas of the aggregates. Seeing the thought of quiescent and wonderful extinction in parinirvāṇa is called the thought of separation, because having no concern and separation are different names for the same thing.
