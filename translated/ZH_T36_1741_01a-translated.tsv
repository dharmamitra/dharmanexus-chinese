['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a06_0', 'ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a07_1']	夫大方廣佛華嚴經者，是一乘圓教佛果之🔽門。	夫大方廣佛華嚴經者，是一乘圓教佛果之 門。	As for the Mahāvaipulya Buddhâvataṃsaka Sūtra, it is the gateway to the perfect teaching of the One Vehicle and the Buddha's fruition.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a08_6']	佛果者，體無成壞，以化眾生故，示現自成正覺佛果之樣。	佛果者，體無成壞，以化眾生故，示現自成正覺佛果之樣。	As for the Buddha's fruition, its essence is beyond formation and destruction. In order to transform sentient beings, it manifests the model of the Buddha's fruition of perfect enlightenment that it itself achieves.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a10_7']	舉自五位因果，及攝化境界、報得莊嚴，示與後人，令其發志依法倣學，令修行者所歸不疑。	舉自五位因果，及攝化境界、報得莊嚴，示與後人，令其發志依法倣學，令修行者所歸不疑。	It presents its own five stages of cause and effect, as well as the realm of transformative activity and the adornments obtained through retribution, showing them to later generations so that they may aspire to follow the Dharma and learn from it. It enables practitioners to have no doubts about their destination.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a11_8']	若不曉解發心初因，如何發意修其成佛之道？	若不曉解發心初因，如何發意修其成佛之道？	If one does not understand the initial causes for arousing the mind, how can one arouse the intention to cultivate the path to becoming a Buddha?
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a15_8']	設畏罪修福，及息妄住心，及願生淨土，乃至二乘得果永超三界，且是求自免苦之心，未有以十方三塗人天苦道及自心之境便成智境，與一切眾生及以諸佛同一智海之門。	設畏罪修福，及息妄住心，及願生淨土，乃至二乘得果永超三界，且是求自免苦之心，未有以十方三塗人天苦道及自心之境便成智境，與一切眾生及以諸佛同一智海之門。	Even if one cultivates merit out of fear of sin, or abides in the mind by ceasing delusion, or wishes to be born in the Pure Land, or even attains the fruits of the two vehicles and forever transcends the three realms, it is still the mind seeking to escape suffering for oneself, and has not yet taken the realms of the ten directions, the three evil paths, humans, gods, and one's own mind to be the realm of wisdom, the same wisdom ocean as all sentient beings and buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a19_12']	三乘之流，但且說空破有，說一切眾生有自性清淨，又說三千大千世界為一佛報境，又云無數劫修菩薩行成佛，又說他方有淨土、此間是穢土，皆是隨情接引，皆是化城，非真實說。	三乘之流，但且說空破有，說一切眾生有自性清淨，又說三千大千世界為一佛報境，又云無數劫修菩薩行成佛，又說他方有淨土、此間是穢土，皆是隨情接引，皆是化城，非真實說。	The followers of the three vehicles merely speak of emptiness to destroy existence, speak of all sentient beings having self-nature purity, speak of the trichiliocosm as the realm of one buddha's retribution, say that one becomes a buddha after cultivating bodhisattva practices for countless eons, and say that there are Pure Lands in other directions and defiled lands here, all of which are expedient teachings to guide, all of which are provisional cities, not the true teaching.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a20_2']	此一乘智境，皆非邊量。	此一乘智境，皆非邊量。	This wisdom realm of the One Vehicle is all beyond limits.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a21_11']	云十佛剎微塵數身土交參，意明如虛空無盡無限，智境相入故。	云十佛剎微塵數身土交參，意明如虛空無盡無限，智境相入故。	It is said that the bodies and lands are as numerous as the dust motes in ten buddha lands, which clarifies that like space it is inexhaustible and limitless, because the realms of wisdom interpenetrate.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a22_1']	化儀利物，皆如是故。	化儀利物，皆如是故。	Transforming according to circumstances to benefit beings is all like this.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a25_4']	三世劫量，無去無來、無時可遷，不見三世，不見世間及以眾生，不見成佛及不成佛，不見有佛處、無佛處，亦無正法、像法、末法，時分法故。	三世劫量，無去無來、無時可遷，不見三世，不見世間及以眾生，不見成佛及不成佛，不見有佛處、無佛處，亦無正法、像法、末法，時分法故。	The measure of eons in the three times has no past, no future, and no time that can be changed. One does not see the three times, nor does one see the world or sentient beings. One does not see becoming a buddha or not becoming a buddha, nor does one see places with buddhas or places without buddhas. There is also no true Dharma, semblance Dharma, or final Dharma, because it is the Dharma of time and measure.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a27_12']	但以自性普光明無作大智、如虛空平等無作大悲，住眾生見，應根利物而無失時，無所造作，法如是故。	但以自性普光明無作大智、如虛空平等無作大悲，住眾生見，應根利物而無失時，無所造作，法如是故。	But only by the self-nature of universal light, effortless great wisdom, and the equality of space, without effort, great compassion abides in the view of sentient beings, responding to their capacities and benefiting them without missing the right time, without any creation, because the Dharma is like this.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a28_8']	智由三昧觀照迷解顯得，不是修成；	智由三昧觀照迷解顯得，不是修成；	Wisdom is manifested by the contemplation of samādhi, not by cultivation;
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a28_18']	悲由願興，不是自然。	悲由願興，不是自然。	Compassion arises from vows, not naturally.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012a29_7']	以願興成，功終願廢。	以願興成，功終願廢。	Because it is accomplished by the arising of vows, once the merit is completed the vows are abandoned.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012b02_12']	五位之中，十住第八、十行第八、十迴向第八、十地第八，分分無功智悲任運利物，故皆至等覺方終。	五位之中，十住第八、十行第八、十迴向第八、十地第八，分分無功智悲任運利物，故皆至等覺方終。	Among the five stages, the eighth of the ten abodes, the eighth of the ten practices, the eighth of the ten dedications, and the eighth of the ten grounds, each has the wisdom and compassion that operate spontaneously to benefit beings without effort, so they all end only at the stage of equal enlightenment.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012b04_1']	智悲道滿，時亦不改、法亦不移，但為住熟不同，時法元來不異。	智悲道滿，時亦不改、法亦不移，但為住熟不同，時法元來不異。	When the path of wisdom and compassion is fulfilled, the time does not change and the Dharma does not move. It is only because the stages of abiding and maturation are different that the time and Dharma originally do not differ.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012b05_20']	如三乘一乘境界殊別，事廣難量，今但略敘紀綱，廣申難盡，意令行者順轍，不枉其功。	如三乘一乘境界殊別，事廣難量，今但略敘紀綱，廣申難盡，意令行者順轍，不枉其功。	Just as the realms of the Three Vehicles and One Vehicle are distinct, the events are vast and difficult to measure. Now I will briefly describe the main points, but it is difficult to fully explain the details. The intention is to enable practitioners to follow the tracks and not waste their efforts.
['ZH_T36_1741_01a:1012b07_9']	於此一部之經略立十門，以知進修之軌，望得免其未得識過歸真。	於此一部之經略立十門，以知進修之軌，望得免其未得識過歸真。	In this one part of the sūtra, I will briefly establish ten topics to understand the rules for advancing and cultivating, hoping to avoid the mistake of not recognizing the faults and returning to the truth.
