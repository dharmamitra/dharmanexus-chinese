['ZH_T32_1647_002:0383c15_2']	揣食眾生並患飢苦，如地獄品說，是故飢病最為第一。	揣食眾生並患飢苦，如地獄品說，是故飢病最為第一。	002	Sentient beings who consume solid food all suffer from hunger and pain, as explained in the chapter on hells. Therefore, hunger and illness are the most severe.

Because the faculties are extinguished, the mental factors follow and are extinguished. Warmth, life, and consciousness abandon the body faculty. At that time, it is called death.
['ZH_T32_1647_002:0383c20_1']	如偈說：	如偈說：	002	As a verse says:

['ZH_T32_1647_002:0384a12_13']	怖畏苦故，是人臨終為死金剛之所破壞，應往他方，非所究悉，將離親友，我之愛熱所護身屋崩破壞時，永離所作生重怖畏，故說死苦。	怖畏苦故，是人臨終為死金剛之所破壞，應往他方，非所究悉，將離親友，我之愛熱所護身屋崩破壞時，永離所作生重怖畏，故說死苦。	002	Because of the suffering of fear, when this person is about to die, they are destroyed by the adamantine vajra of death, they should go to another place, but they cannot investigate it, they are about to part from their friends, and when the house of the body that is protected by my beloved heat collapses and is destroyed, they are permanently separated from what they have done and give rise to grave fear. Therefore, the suffering of death is explained.

As the Sutra on the Dharma of Death says, it is therefore called the suffering of death.
['ZH_T32_1647_002:0384a17_15']	復次劇胎苦故，是人在胎中時恒受重苦，或母飲食相違威儀疲極，他所逼苦，雖受大苦而不失命。	復次劇胎苦故，是人在胎中時恒受重苦，或母飲食相違威儀疲極，他所逼苦，雖受大苦而不失命。	002	Moreover, because of the severe suffering in the womb, this person constantly experiences great suffering while in the womb, either due to the mother's diet being incompatible, her deportment being tired and exhausted, or being oppressed by others. Although they experience great suffering, they do not lose their life.
['ZH_T32_1647_002:0384a18_9']	若死苦來，頓奪前苦，命根即絕。	若死苦來，頓奪前苦，命根即絕。	002	If the suffering of death comes, it suddenly takes away the previous suffering, and the life root is immediately severed.
['ZH_T32_1647_002:0384a19_3']	出胎亦爾，雖受大苦亦不失命。	出胎亦爾，雖受大苦亦不失命。	002	It is the same when leaving the womb. Although one experiences great suffering, one still does not lose one's life.
['ZH_T32_1647_002:0384a19_18']	死苦若來，奪此生苦，命根即滅。	死苦若來，奪此生苦，命根即滅。	002	If the suffering of death comes, it takes away the suffering of this birth, and the life root is extinguished.

Having not lived with loved ones for long, due to youth, health, nature, strength, freedom, and the superiority of wealth, one always gives rise to intoxicated arrogance.
['ZH_T32_1647_002:0384a22_13']	是時若死，其苦無比。	是時若死，其苦無比。	002	At that time, if one dies, the suffering is incomparable.
