['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c06_0', 'ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c07_1']	問：菩薩有二，謂頓、漸悟，疏有二釋，何者為🔽長？	問：菩薩有二，謂頓、漸悟，疏有二釋，何者為 長？	001	Question: There are two kinds of bodhisattvas, namely those who awaken suddenly and those who awaken gradually. The treatise has two explanations. Which one is correct?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c07_3']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c08_10']	據其證理名頓悟，得聖迴心名漸悟，勝未得聖者，理未悟故。	據其證理名頓悟，得聖迴心名漸悟，勝未得聖者，理未悟故。	001	According to the realization of truth, it is called sudden awakening. Attaining sagehood and turning the mind is called gradual awakening. Those who have not yet attained sagehood are superior because the truth has not yet been realized.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c10_12']	若以信悟而名漸悟，有定姓大乘人，曾未聞大，創即聞小，雖不趣求聞而信解，豈名漸悟耶？	若以信悟而名漸悟，有定姓大乘人，曾未聞大，創即聞小，雖不趣求聞而信解，豈名漸悟耶？	001	If awakening through faith is called gradual awakening, there are those of the definite Mahāyāna lineage who have never heard the Mahāyāna before. They first hear the Hīnayāna. Although they do not seek it, they hear and believe it. How can this be called gradual awakening?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c11_16']	若此信解不名漸悟，故未得聖即迴心者，亦非漸悟。	若此信解不名漸悟，故未得聖即迴心者，亦非漸悟。	001	If this faith and understanding is not called gradual awakening, then those who have not yet attained sagehood and immediately turn the mind are also not gradually awakened.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c12_14']	若爾彼類定生時等生數無多，何非漸悟？	若爾彼類定生時等生數無多，何非漸悟？	001	If so, their kind has a definite time of birth, etc., and the number of births is not many. Why is it not gradual awakening?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c13_1']	此亦不然。	此亦不然。	001	This is also not so.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c13_19']	若趣小果已定生等，若迴趣大生數不定。	若趣小果已定生等，若迴趣大生數不定。	001	If they are already definitely born, etc., in the direction of the Hīnayāna fruit, if they turn to the Mahāyāna, the number of births is indefinite.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c14_1']	問：	問：	001	Question:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c15_1']	既定生時，即無多生又不造業，如何不定？	既定生時，即無多生又不造業，如何不定？	001	Once the time of birth is determined, there are not many births and one does not create karma. How is it not indeterminate?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c15_7']	誰言不造業？	誰言不造業？	001	Who says one does not create karma?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c16_13']	論說有支非攝二位，以憎背有故，若許造業，何非有支？	論說有支非攝二位，以憎背有故，若許造業，何非有支？	001	The treatise says that the two states of existence are not included in the links of existence, because one turns one's back on existence. If one is allowed to create karma, why is it not a link of existence?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c16_15']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c16_19']	有二解：	有二解：	001	There are two explanations:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c17_8']	一釋據無漏者非有支攝。	一釋據無漏者非有支攝。	001	One explanation says that those without outflows are not included in the links of existence.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c17_16']	所以《雜集》云：	所以《雜集》云：	001	Therefore the Saṃyuktâbhidharmahṛdaya says:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c18_12']	道諦攝非有漏者，不爾如何感十王果？	道諦攝非有漏者，不爾如何感十王果？	001	The truth of the path includes that which is not contaminated. Otherwise, how does it give rise to the fruits of the ten kings?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c19_17']	諸論皆說六波羅蜜，咸感彼故，設無相行亦感彼果故。	諸論皆說六波羅蜜，咸感彼故，設無相行亦感彼果故。	001	All treatises say that the six perfections all give rise to those fruits. Even if there is formless practice, it also gives rise to those fruits.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c20_7']	無著《般若論》云：	無著《般若論》云：	001	Asaṅga's Prajñāpāramitā Treatise says:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c20_21']	一遍故，若不感有漏如何言遍？	一遍故，若不感有漏如何言遍？	001	One is pervasive. If it does not give rise to contaminated [existence], how can it be said to be pervasive?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c21_17']	又正二，不能正感，於此位造感有業故。	又正二，不能正感，於此位造感有業故。	001	Moreover, the two correct [attitudes] cannot correctly give rise to [existence]. Because in this state one creates karma that gives rise to existence.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c22_6']	《緣起經》云：	《緣起經》云：	001	The Pratītyasamutpāda Sūtra says:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c22_11']	內法異生。	內法異生。	001	The ordinary person of internal dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c23_12']	若放逸者，三種無明為緣，若不放逸不說無明為緣。	若放逸者，三種無明為緣，若不放逸不說無明為緣。	001	If one is heedless, the three kinds of ignorance are the conditions. If one is not heedless, ignorance is not said to be a condition.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c24_15']	又說，諸聖有學不造感後有業，不言非聖亦不造業。	又說，諸聖有學不造感後有業，不言非聖亦不造業。	001	It is also said that the noble ones in training do not create karma that leads to future existence, but it is not said that the non-noble ones also do not create karma.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c25_14']	又云若無苦無苦下，無明諸行不生二位。	又云若無苦無苦下，無明諸行不生二位。	001	It is also said that if there is no suffering or suffering below, the ignorance and formations do not arise in two states.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c26_6']	既容現行，何不造業？	既容現行，何不造業？	001	Since it is possible to engage in present activity, why not create karma?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c27_11']	加行頓伏據滿位說，以此故知迴心行經多生，故成頓悟。	加行頓伏據滿位說，以此故知迴心行經多生，故成頓悟。	001	The sudden subduing of the preparatory [path] is said in terms of the complete [stage]. For this reason, we know that those who turn back [to the Mahayana] experience many lives before becoming suddenly enlightened.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c28_2']	又《雜集論》第十三云：	又《雜集論》第十三云：	001	Also, the thirteenth chapter of the Abhidharmasamuccaya-vyākhyā says:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0854c29_5']	於此生中決定堪能通達諦理，是名通達順決擇分。	於此生中決定堪能通達諦理，是名通達順決擇分。	001	In this life, one is definitely able to penetrate the truth, and this is called the stage of penetrating the truth that leads to decisive discrimination.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a02_14']	即此位中不定種姓者，為欲迴向最勝菩提，及諸獨覺為求無師自證菩提轉趣餘生，是名餘生順決擇分。	即此位中不定種姓者，為欲迴向最勝菩提，及諸獨覺為求無師自證菩提轉趣餘生，是名餘生順決擇分。	001	In this stage, those of indeterminate lineage, in order to turn towards the supreme enlightenment, and the solitary realizers, in order to seek enlightenment without a teacher, turn towards other lives. This is called the stage of penetrating the truth that leads to decisive discrimination in other lives.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a03_7']	既云轉趣餘生，明生不定。	既云轉趣餘生，明生不定。	001	Since it is said that one turns towards other lives, it is clear that the life is indeterminate.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a04_10']	又復法師本意不說若定生等，雖後迴心必取聖果。	又復法師本意不說若定生等，雖後迴心必取聖果。	001	Moreover, the original intention of the Dharma master is not to say that if one is definitely born, etc., even if one later turns the mind, one will necessarily attain the holy fruit.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a04_21']	下引《善勇猛般若》云：	下引《善勇猛般若》云：	001	Below, it cites the Prajñā of Subāhu:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a06_11']	未入正性離生者，據不受變易者，既不受變易，明即趣大、非小聖果。	未入正性離生者，據不受變易者，既不受變易，明即趣大、非小聖果。	001	One who has not yet entered the correct state of separation from birth refers to one who does not undergo transformation. Since one does not undergo transformation, it is clear that one proceeds to the great, not to the fruit of the lesser vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a07_1']	言定生時等，假敘他爾。	言定生時等，假敘他爾。	001	The phrase at the time of definite birth, etc. hypothetically describes it as such.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a09_3']	今又助釋，設是凡夫未求於小即求大乘，但不定姓亦名漸悟，以必不能一往趣故，必中退故。	今又助釋，設是凡夫未求於小即求大乘，但不定姓亦名漸悟，以必不能一往趣故，必中退故。	001	Now, I will further explain. Even if one is an ordinary person who has not yet sought the lesser and seeks the Great Vehicle, but is of undetermined lineage, one is also called gradually enlightened, because one is necessarily unable to proceed directly and must regress in the middle.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a11_4']	若云不聞說一乘即可有退，聞說一乘即必不退，舍利弗等曾亦聞說妙法一乘，如何有退？	若云不聞說一乘即可有退，聞說一乘即必不退，舍利弗等曾亦聞說妙法一乘，如何有退？	001	If it is said that one can regress if one does not hear the teaching of the One Vehicle, and that one will necessarily not regress if one hears the teaching of the One Vehicle, then Śāriputra and others have also heard the teaching of the wonderful Dharma of the One Vehicle. How is it that they regressed?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a12_12']	以此故知但有小姓必退取小，得聖方迴始成不退，故名漸悟。	以此故知但有小姓必退取小，得聖方迴始成不退，故名漸悟。	001	For this reason, we know that only those of the lesser lineage will necessarily regress and attain the lesser, and only after attaining the holy will they turn and begin to become non-regressing, thus being called gradually enlightened.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a14_17']	設有種種界，雖有小姓容有不退，終是彼類，以有一分小乘種子成漸悟法，亦名漸悟，是不定姓故。	設有種種界，雖有小姓容有不退，終是彼類，以有一分小乘種子成漸悟法，亦名漸悟，是不定姓故。	001	Even if there are various types of faculties, although there may be those of low family who are not subject to retrogression, they are still of that type, because they have the seeds of the Lesser Vehicle, which are the dharmas of gradual enlightenment, and are also called gradually enlightened, because they are of indeterminate type.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a14_19']	問：	問：	001	Question:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a15_17']	既為斷疑說斯妙法，何故聞已復更疑生？	既為斷疑說斯妙法，何故聞已復更疑生？	001	Since this wonderful Dharma was taught in order to eliminate doubts, why did doubts arise again after hearing it?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a15_19']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a16_16']	疑有新舊，舊疑不得作佛，故未迴心。	疑有新舊，舊疑不得作佛，故未迴心。	001	There are new and old doubts. The old doubt was that one could not become a Buddha, so the mind had not yet been turned.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a18_9']	說昔非真皆當作佛，初聞佛所說，心中大驚疑，將非魔作佛惱亂我心耶？	說昔非真皆當作佛，初聞佛所說，心中大驚疑，將非魔作佛惱亂我心耶？	001	When it was said that what was taught in the past was not true and that everyone would become a Buddha, upon first hearing what the Buddha taught, there was great doubt in their minds, thinking, Is this not a demon pretending to be a Buddha, disturbing our minds?
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a19_3']	乃至我聞疑網斷，故為斷疑。	乃至我聞疑網斷，故為斷疑。	001	Up to when they heard that the web of doubt was to be eliminated, it was in order to eliminate doubt.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a20_12']	言謂已定生，即此生時及一生順決擇分等者，《雜集》十三云：	言謂已定生，即此生時及一生順決擇分等者，《雜集》十三云：	001	As for saying that they were already determined to be born, and when they were born, and when they gave rise to the factors conducive to penetration, etc., the Abhidharmasamuccaya-vyākhyā says:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a23_11']	未具資糧補特伽羅、已具未具資糧補特伽羅、已具資糧補特伽羅，乃至云如是三種補特伽羅由成就順解脫分、順決擇分各三品故。	未具資糧補特伽羅、已具未具資糧補特伽羅、已具資糧補特伽羅，乃至云如是三種補特伽羅由成就順解脫分、順決擇分各三品故。	001	There are three kinds of persons: those who have not yet accumulated the equipment, those who have accumulated and have not accumulated the equipment, and those who have accumulated the equipment. In this way, the three kinds of persons are distinguished according to the possession of three grades of the factors that contribute to liberation and penetration.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a25_15']	約能引生順決擇分及諦現觀，如其次第未定已定即此生時，於諦增上法淨信勝解相是順解脫分。	約能引生順決擇分及諦現觀，如其次第未定已定即此生時，於諦增上法淨信勝解相是順解脫分。	001	In terms of being able to induce the factors that contribute to penetration and the clear realization of the truths, in the order in which they occur, those that are not yet determined and those that are already determined, at the time of their occurrence, the characteristics of faith and understanding that are superior to the truths are the factors that contribute to liberation.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a26_13']	即於此法諦密法忍相是順決擇分。	即於此法諦密法忍相是順決擇分。	001	The characteristics of the acquiescence to the truths of the Dharma that are secret in the Dharma are the factors that contribute to penetration.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a27_9']	如其次第信增上故、慧增上故。	如其次第信增上故、慧增上故。	001	In the order in which they occur, they are superior to faith and superior to discernment.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a28_5']	此中三品順決擇分者，除世第一法。	此中三品順決擇分者，除世第一法。	001	Among these, the three grades of factors that contribute to penetration are distinguished except for the supreme worldly dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855a29_16']	由世第一法性唯一剎那必不相續，即此生時定入現觀，非前位故。	由世第一法性唯一剎那必不相續，即此生時定入現觀，非前位故。	001	Because the nature of the supreme worldly dharmas is only one instant and they definitely do not continue, when they occur, one definitely enters the clear realization, because it is not the previous stage.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b02_8']	前文意顯資糧、加行二位之中各有三品，如其次第未定已定即此生時。	前文意顯資糧、加行二位之中各有三品，如其次第未定已定即此生時。	001	The meaning of the above passage is that in the two stages of equipment and added effort there are three grades, which are respectively not yet determined, already determined, and the time of their arising.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b04_15']	然加行位分為三品，未定已定即此生時在煗、頂、忍，除世第一法，世第一法唯一剎那必不相續不可分之。	然加行位分為三品，未定已定即此生時在煗、頂、忍，除世第一法，世第一法唯一剎那必不相續不可分之。	001	However, the stage of added effort is divided into three grades, which are not yet determined, already determined, and the time of their arising. They are in the stages of heat, summit, and patience, excluding the supreme worldly dharmas. The supreme worldly dharmas are only one instant and necessarily do not continue, so they cannot be divided.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b06_12']	然云即此生時定入現觀者，此據剎那生說，前解脫分言即此生時約一期生說。	然云即此生時定入現觀者，此據剎那生說，前解脫分言即此生時約一期生說。	001	However, it is said that at the time of their arising one definitely enters into clear realization. This is said from the perspective of the arising of an instant. The previous explanation of the stage of liberation is said from the perspective of a lifetime.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b09_16']	又解俱約一期生說，以世第一法云即此生時，既除世第一法明約一期，雖增上忍亦一剎那猶隔世第一法，非即此剎那生，無間入見故。	又解俱約一期生說，以世第一法云即此生時，既除世第一法明約一期，雖增上忍亦一剎那猶隔世第一法，非即此剎那生，無間入見故。	001	Another interpretation is that both are said from the perspective of a lifetime, because the supreme worldly dharmas are said to be at the time of their arising. Since the supreme worldly dharmas are excluded, it is clear that it is from the perspective of a lifetime. Although the supreme worldly dharmas are also one instant, they are still separated from the supreme worldly dharmas, and are not the arising of that instant, because they enter into the path of insight without interval.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b10_13']	又復通分煗、頂、忍三，為三時故。	又復通分煗、頂、忍三，為三時故。	001	Moreover, it is also a general division of the three stages of heat, summit, and patience, because they are the three times.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b11_3']	就順決擇分復有六種：	就順決擇分復有六種：	001	As for the aids to penetration, there are six kinds:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b12_10']	一隨順順決擇分、二勝進、三通達、四餘轉、五一生、六一坐。	一隨順順決擇分、二勝進、三通達、四餘轉、五一生、六一坐。	001	1) aids to penetration that are conducive to penetration, 2) aids to penetration that are superior progress, 3) aids to penetration that are penetrating insight, 4) aids to penetration that are turning away from the rest, 5) aids to penetration that are in one life, and 6) aids to penetration that are in one sitting.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b13_12']	最初所起緣諦境行下品善根，名隨順順決擇分。	最初所起緣諦境行下品善根，名隨順順決擇分。	001	The lowest grade of good roots that are conditioned by the objects of the four truths and that are initially produced are called aids to penetration that are conducive to penetration.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b14_19']	即此善根轉成中品，名勝進順決擇分，望前下品為增勝故。	即此善根轉成中品，名勝進順決擇分，望前下品為增勝故。	001	These good roots, when they turn into the middle grade, are called aids to penetration that are superior progress, because they are superior to the lower grade.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b16_11']	即此善根增至上品，於此生中決定堪能通達諦理，名通達順決擇分。	即此善根增至上品，於此生中決定堪能通達諦理，名通達順決擇分。	001	These good roots, when they increase to the highest grade, are called aids to penetration that are penetrating insight, because in this life one is definitely able to penetrate the principle of the four truths.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b17_2']	此前三種在煖、頂、忍位。	此前三種在煖、頂、忍位。	001	These first three kinds are in the stages of heat, summit, and patience.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b18_2']	若約小乘，可得如次配未定已定即此生時；	若約小乘，可得如次配未定已定即此生時；	001	If one is speaking of the Hinayana, one can assign them in order to the undetermined, the determined, and the very time of this life.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b19_15']	若大乘者，中忍滿位方名即此生時，若在下忍及中忍位未滿之時猶多生故。	若大乘者，中忍滿位方名即此生時，若在下忍及中忍位未滿之時猶多生故。	001	If one is speaking of the Mahayana, the stage of full patience in the middle grade is called the very time of this life. If one is in the lower or middle grades of patience that are not yet full, one still has many lives.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b20_19']	若二乘位，雖即此生可有迴趣，名餘轉順決擇分。	若二乘位，雖即此生可有迴趣，名餘轉順決擇分。	001	If one is in the stage of the two vehicles, although one may turn toward the Great Vehicle in this very life, one is called one who turns to the other and conforms to the factors of enlightenment that penetrate to the truth.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b22_8']	若餘轉者生生即不定，以求獨覺無上菩提更於多生修勝行故。	若餘轉者生生即不定，以求獨覺無上菩提更於多生修勝行故。	001	If one turns to the other, one is not definitely fixed in life after life, because in seeking the enlightenment of a pratyekabuddha or supreme enlightenment, one cultivates superior practices in many lives.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0855b24_18']	若在大乘順決擇分者，必不迴心趣餘下乘，況一生等以第七住昇名不退，此決擇分在迴向修，以此准之。	若在大乘順決擇分者，必不迴心趣餘下乘，況一生等以第七住昇名不退，此決擇分在迴向修，以此准之。	001	If one is in the stage of conforming to the factors of enlightenment that penetrate to the truth in the Great Vehicle, one certainly does not turn toward other lower vehicles, much less in one life, etc., because in the seventh abode one ascends and is called nonretrogression.

This gives rise to the current of craving and entering the dense forest of wrong views and various views of non-Buddhists. When the Tathāgata appears in the world, he gathers these two kinds of wrong views and returns them to the five vehicles of rightness. Among these two, there are those who have not heard the Dharma and those who practice non-Dharma, who are accomplished as humans and gods.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0859b13_15']	三乘性者，三法攝故，攝彼二邪歸乎五正。	三乘性者，三法攝故，攝彼二邪歸乎五正。	001	As for those with the nature of the three vehicles, they are included in the three dharmas, and thus those two kinds of wrong views are gathered and returned to the five kinds of rightness.

For those of dull faculties, although they abandon the two kinds of wrong views, there are still differences in the five vehicles. Gathering the previous five differences, they are returned to the same one vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0859b18_4']	三攝因歸異者，離攝五歸一但是因行，欲令修因證極果故，說稱如來真應兩身為攝因歸果門。	三攝因歸異者，離攝五歸一但是因行，欲令修因證極果故，說稱如來真應兩身為攝因歸果門。	001	Third, gathering the causes and returning to the different means that apart from gathering the five and returning to the one, this is merely the practice of causes. In order to cultivate the causes and realize the ultimate fruit, it is said that the Tathāgata's true and response bodies are the gate of gathering the causes and returning to the fruit.

For over forty years he spoke of the three trainings. Now, in this Lotus Sutra, he finally unifies them into one, which is gathering the branches and returning to the root.

For these three illnesses, three kinds of teaching methods are shown.

Not born and not extinguished is called the Dharma body. The expedient preaching of extinction is called the trace function. Therefore, being born in the royal palace is not arising, and being extinguished at the twin trees is not losing. Although the traces are born and extinguished, the Dharma body has never arisen or passed away.

According to the Commentary on the Wheel of Schools, each has four kinds, namely teaching, principle, practice, and fruition, which can be summarized into three.

As those treatises say, I have already drunk the nectar and attained immortality.

['ZH_T34_1724_001:0860a21_13']	三如法言者，如佛所說因果道理，說苦集是世間因果，滅道為出世因果，道理相稱不乖僻故，名如法言。	三如法言者，如佛所說因果道理，說苦集是世間因果，滅道為出世因果，道理相稱不乖僻故，名如法言。	001	Third, as for the words in accordance with the Dharma, it is as the Buddha said, the principle of cause and effect. He said that suffering and its cause are the cause and effect of the world, while cessation and the path are the cause and effect of transcending the world. The principle corresponds and does not deviate, so it is called the words in accordance with the Dharma.

Therefore, it is called accordance with the essence.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0860a25_11']	行有三者：	行有三者：	001	There are three practices:

The teaching is precisely the goodness of beginning, middle, and end, etc. The principle is precisely the separation from the exaggeration and denigration, etc. of practice, the separation from suffering and happiness, etc. The fruit is not the basis of the various sufferings of the world, and is not tainted by the afflictions of consciousness. Therefore, it is called purity.

['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861b18_18']	一者離喻，二合喻，三者通喻。	一者離喻，二合喻，三者通喻。	001	First, the separate metaphor, second, the combined metaphor, and third, the general metaphor.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861b20_1']	言離喻者，一明此華不有而已，有則華實俱合；	言離喻者，一明此華不有而已，有則華實俱合；	001	As for the separate metaphor, first, this flower is not just present, if present, then the flower and fruit are both present;
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861b21_14']	此經不說而已，說則因果雙舉，故以蓮華喻於因果，故論云示現因果相等。	此經不說而已，說則因果雙舉，故以蓮華喻於因果，故論云示現因果相等。	001	This sutra is not just spoken, if spoken, then cause and effect are both mentioned, therefore using the lotus flower as a metaphor for cause and effect, therefore the treatise says manifesting the characteristics of cause and effect, etc.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861b23_14']	二者由華開而實現，由言發而理顯，故以蓮華喻於教理，故下云其義深遠其語巧妙等。	二者由華開而實現，由言發而理顯，故以蓮華喻於教理，故下云其義深遠其語巧妙等。	001	Second, because the flower blooms and the fruit becomes apparent, because the words are spoken and the principle becomes evident, therefore using the lotus flower as a metaphor for the teaching and principle, therefore the following says its meaning is profound and its words are skillful and wonderful, etc.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861b27_7']	三者華未開而實未現，華開則實方現，未開方便門則真實相未顯，開方便門則真實相方顯，華開喻方便門開，實現譬真實相顯也，故下云開方便門顯真實相。	三者華未開而實未現，華開則實方現，未開方便門則真實相未顯，開方便門則真實相方顯，華開喻方便門開，實現譬真實相顯也，故下云開方便門顯真實相。	001	Third, the flower has not yet bloomed and the fruit is not yet visible. When the flower blooms, the fruit is then revealed. If the gate of skillful means is not opened, the true nature is not yet manifest. When the gate of skillful means is opened, the true nature is then revealed. The blooming flower is a metaphor for the opening of the gate of skillful means, and the actual fruit is a metaphor for the manifestation of the true nature. Therefore, the text below says, Opening the gate of skillful means and revealing the true nature.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861b27_17']	二合喻者，略有十義：	二合喻者，略有十義：	001	The second is the combined metaphor, which has ten meanings in brief:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861b29_3']	一華從種生，喻一乘必有種起，故下云佛種從緣起等。	一華從種生，喻一乘必有種起，故下云佛種從緣起等。	001	First, the flower grows from the seed, a metaphor for the One Vehicle that must arise from the seed. Therefore, the text below says, The Buddha's seed arises from conditions.

Therefore, the text below says, The Tathāgata has already left the burning house of the three realms, peacefully dwelling in the forest.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861c06_12']	四者此華雖出泥水而不捨泥水，喻佛雖出四流之外，而不捨三界之中，故下云在門外立聞有人言驚入火宅方宜救濟。	四者此華雖出泥水而不捨泥水，喻佛雖出四流之外，而不捨三界之中，故下云在門外立聞有人言驚入火宅方宜救濟。	001	Fourth, although this flower comes from mud and water, it does not abandon the mud and water. It is a metaphor for the Buddha, who although he has emerged beyond the four currents, does not abandon the three realms within. Therefore, the text below says, Standing outside the gate, he heard someone say, startled, he entered the burning house and devised a plan to rescue them.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861c08_15']	五者此華妙潔第一，喻於佛乘五乘第一，故下云是乘微妙清淨第一，於諸世間為無有上等。	五者此華妙潔第一，喻於佛乘五乘第一，故下云是乘微妙清淨第一，於諸世間為無有上等。	001	Fifth, this flower is supremely pure and clean, a metaphor for the Buddha vehicle being the foremost of the five vehicles. Therefore, the text below says, This vehicle is subtle, pure, and foremost, unsurpassed in the world.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861c11_3']	六者此華凡聖歎愛，佛乘亦爾，世出世間稱歎愛敬，故下云佛所悅可一切眾生所應稱讚供養禮拜。	六者此華凡聖歎愛，佛乘亦爾，世出世間稱歎愛敬，故下云佛所悅可一切眾生所應稱讚供養禮拜。	001	Sixth, this flower is praised and loved by both ordinary and holy beings.

Therefore, it says below that the Buddha himself abides in the Mahayana, and the Dharma he has attained is adorned with the power of samādhi and prajñā, and with this he delivers sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861c18_5']	九者此華開合有時，喻此一乘隱顯有時，昔隱今顯，故下云所以未曾說，說時未至故，今正是其時，決定說大乘。	九者此華開合有時，喻此一乘隱顯有時，昔隱今顯，故下云所以未曾說，說時未至故，今正是其時，決定說大乘。	001	Ninth, this flower opens and closes at times, and it is a metaphor for the Mahayana being hidden and revealed at times. It was hidden in the past but revealed now. Therefore, it says below, The reason it has not been explained before is that the time for explaining it has not yet come. Now is precisely the right time, and the Mahayana will definitely be explained.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861c22_3']	十者此華劫初成時梵王坐上為眾生父，是經亦爾，故下云如大梵王一切世間之父，此經亦爾，為一切世間之父，為一切賢聖等父，餘處復說智度菩薩母以方便為父等。	十者此華劫初成時梵王坐上為眾生父，是經亦爾，故下云如大梵王一切世間之父，此經亦爾，為一切世間之父，為一切賢聖等父，餘處復說智度菩薩母以方便為父等。	001	Tenth, when this flower first forms in the kalpa, the Brahma King sits on top of it as the father of sentient beings. This sutra is also like this. Therefore, it says below, Just as the Great Brahma King is the father of all worlds, this sutra is also like this, serving as the father of all worlds, as the father of all sages and saints, and so forth. In other places, it is also said that prajñā is the mother of bodhisattvas and skillful means is the father, and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0861c22_15']	三通喻者，《大集經》云：	三通喻者，《大集經》云：	001	Third, the general metaphor, the Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra says:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0862a01_3']	慈悲為根莖，智慧為華葉，三昧為鬚臺，解脫為敷實，菩薩為蜂王，涅槃為甘露，是故我頂禮《妙法蓮華經》。	慈悲為根莖，智慧為華葉，三昧為鬚臺，解脫為敷實，菩薩為蜂王，涅槃為甘露，是故我頂禮《妙法蓮華經》。	001	Compassion is the roots and stems, wisdom is the flowers and leaves, samādhi is the stamens and pedestals, liberation is the spreading fruit, the bodhisattvas are the bee kings, nirvāṇa is the sweet dew.

['ZH_T34_1724_001:0862a03_14']	良以妙法難解，從近喻遠也。	良以妙法難解，從近喻遠也。	001	It is because the wonderful Dharma is difficult to understand that it is compared to something familiar to illustrate something distant.
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0862a04_8']	次意乃多，略擬前後合成六喻：	次意乃多，略擬前後合成六喻：	001	The meaning is many, but briefly it is compared to the before and after, forming six metaphors:
['ZH_T34_1724_001:0862a06_10']	一為蓮故華，喻為實故權，故下云知第一寂滅，以方便力故，雖示種種道，其實為佛乘等。	一為蓮故華，喻為實故權，故下云知第一寂滅，以方便力故，雖示種種道，其實為佛乘等。	001	First, for the sake of the lotus, there is the flower, which is a metaphor for the provisional for the sake of the real. Therefore, the text below says, Knowing the supreme quiescence, by the power of skillful means, although various paths are shown, in reality it is for the sake of the Buddha vehicle, and so forth.

['ZH_T34_1724_001:0862a11_16']	四又蓮喻本，華喻於迹，從本垂迹，迹依於本，下文云劫濁亂時，乃至云是故諸佛如來以方便力於一佛乘分別說三等。	四又蓮喻本，華喻於迹，從本垂迹，迹依於本，下文云劫濁亂時，乃至云是故諸佛如來以方便力於一佛乘分別說三等。	001	Fourth, moreover, the lotus is a metaphor for the origin, and the flower is a metaphor for the traces. Extending the traces from the origin, the traces depend on the origin. The text below says, During the turbulent times of the kalpa defilements... and so on, up to Therefore, the buddhas and tathāgatas, with the power of skillful means, distinguish the one buddha vehicle and speak of the three...

The text below says, The Dharma of all buddhas and tathāgatas is like this. In order to save sentient beings, all of it is real and not false...

It dispels the attachment to the teachings of the provisional city, abandons the lingering emotions of the grass hut, opens the provisional gate of skillful means, reveals the wonderful principle of the true reality, unifies the minor practices of the myriad virtues, and returns to the vast and great One Vehicle. The upper, middle, and lower capacities are all given predictions.

Therefore, it increases the path and reduces the four forms of birth, becoming a neighbor of great enlightenment. The matters and principles of the one-time transformative path are both perfectly manifested. The metaphor of the lotus flower is intended for this.

Since Wonderful Sound manifested, he was able to see him as a condition. He definitely needed the Buddha's power. Therefore, although they sat together, he saw him only after requesting.

It cannot be said that the stupa is gone by the time of the text, as there is no place in the text where the stupa is dismissed.

The three vehicles are separately explained as antidotes. Since there are definitely people, there is no nirvana but there is a sense of superiority. Because there is worldly samādhi and samāpatti, there is no true nirvana but one gives rise to the thought of nirvana. The parable of the illusory city is explained as an antidote to this.

Seeking temporary rest, he is led by emptiness to head towards the great. Now there is another meaning to counteract the capable ones among the learners who are not yet determined, and those who are determined grasp the nirvāṇa attained by the adepts as being ultimate, and aspire towards it.

Therefore, the treatise says that in order to show the supremacy of the seed, the analogy of rain is given. As for the practice you are engaged in is the bodhisattva path, it means that after regressing from the aspiration for enlightenment, one may arouse it again. The previously cultivated wholesome roots are not extinguished, because they are the same as the later attainment of the fruit.

They are only able to cultivate again and attain buddhahood. It is in order to make firm the aspiration for those who have already aroused it, and in order to make those who have not yet aroused it hear of the unsurpassed and arouse the aspiration.

It is to clarify that what you are practicing is the good bodhisattva path, clarifying that the wholesome roots of the mind generated in the past are not extinguished.

Therefore, it is said that the Tathāgata of Great Permeation and Wisdom, when about to attain enlightenment, still spent ten kalpas, showing that the superior fruit is cultivated with the supreme cause.

Although the Dharma-body and the reward-body are always present, the transformation-body responds to things without being fixed.

Arousing faith, making offerings, hearing the Dharma, upholding and praising it, one attains boundless blessings. Manifesting spiritual powers, taking the superior practices and people and the Dharma as evidence, and further, due to long-practiced causes, one is able to transform and receive. The sages arrive from afar and express their hearing of the sūtra. The Tathāgata touches their heads and earnestly praises them three times, clarifying this superior matter, wishing to make it flow through, therefore the unsurpassed supreme power is explained next.
