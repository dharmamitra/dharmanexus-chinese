['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b13_0']	「須菩提！於意云何？若滿三千七寶布施」以下，	「須菩提！於意云何？若滿三千七寶布施」以下，	Subhūti, what do you think? If one were to give away the seven treasures filling the three thousand worlds...
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b14_0', 'ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b15_1']	此中有九段經文，名為第七具足功德挍量🔽分。	此中有九段經文，名為第七具足功德挍量 分。	Here there are nine sections of sutra text, called the seventh section on the comparison of the merit of completeness.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b15_9']	云何名挍量分者？	云何名挍量分者？	Why is it called the section on comparison?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b17_4']	明以三千七寶布施得福雖多，取相心施是有漏因，但招三界人天有為果報；	明以三千七寶布施得福雖多，取相心施是有漏因，但招三界人天有為果報；	It clarifies that although the merit obtained from giving away the seven treasures filling the three thousand worlds is great, giving with a mind grasping at characteristics is a contaminated cause that only brings about conditioned fruits in the three realms of humans and gods;
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b18_12']	不如受持此經一四句偈，乃與無上佛果具足功德作無漏勝因。	不如受持此經一四句偈，乃與無上佛果具足功德作無漏勝因。	It is not as good as upholding a single four-line verse of this sutra, which becomes an uncontaminated superior cause for the merit of completeness leading to the unsurpassed Buddha fruit.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b19_18']	如此比挍優劣上下勝如不同故，名具足功德挍量分也。	如此比挍優劣上下勝如不同故，名具足功德挍量分也。	Because of comparing the superiority and inferiority, the high and low, and the differences in excellence in this way, it is called the section on the comparison of the merit of completeness.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b20_6']	有何次第起者？	有何次第起者？	What is the sequence in which it arises?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b20_12']	此有疑故也。	此有疑故也。	This arises because of doubt.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b20_19']	此疑從何處生？	此疑從何處生？	Where does this doubt arise from?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b22_1']	從前第六段中如來所說法皆不可取說中生。	從前第六段中如來所說法皆不可取說中生。	It arises from the sixth section above, in the explanation that the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata is all ungraspable.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b22_8']	第二疑云何生？	第二疑云何生？	How does the second doubt arise?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b24_12']	若所證法非是名相、不可取說，所說經教是名相可取可說者，則證說二法名相、無名相條然有異。	若所證法非是名相、不可取說，所說經教是名相可取可說者，則證說二法名相、無名相條然有異。	If the realized Dharma is not names and appearances, and cannot be grasped or spoken of, while the spoken sūtras are names and appearances that can be grasped and spoken of, then the names and appearances of the realized and spoken two Dharmas would be completely different.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b25_4']	若爾，尋此言教不能得證。	若爾，尋此言教不能得證。	If so, then seeking this spoken teaching cannot attain realization.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b26_6']	若不能得證者，受持讀誦此所說經教應無福德。	若不能得證者，受持讀誦此所說經教應無福德。	If one cannot attain realization, then upholding and reciting this spoken sūtra should not have merit.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b26_18']	若無福德者，則因義不成。	若無福德者，則因義不成。	If there is no merit, then the meaning of the cause is not established.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b27_14']	若因義不成，則為空說，無有利益。	若因義不成，則為空說，無有利益。	If the meaning of the cause is not established, then it is empty talk without any benefit.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b28_5']	若無利益，則無修道得果。	若無利益，則無修道得果。	If there is no benefit, then there is no cultivation of the path and attainment of fruition.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820b29_1']	云何餘經中言如來不空說法也。	云何餘經中言如來不空說法也。	How is it that other sūtras say the Tathāgata does not speak the Dharma in vain?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c01_1']	若然，受持此能詮言教，為有福德、為無福德？	若然，受持此能詮言教，為有福德、為無福德？	If so, is there merit or no merit in upholding this able to expound the teaching?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c01_18']	有此疑也，故引三千世界等經文答之。	有此疑也，故引三千世界等經文答之。	There is this doubt, so the sūtra text of the three thousand worlds and so forth is cited to answer it.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c03_4']	答意云受持此經一四句偈所得功德勝前七寶施福。	答意云受持此經一四句偈所得功德勝前七寶施福。	The meaning of the answer is that the merit obtained from upholding a single four-line verse of this sūtra surpasses the merit of the previous offering of the seven treasures.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c05_3']	所以然者，明此一偈經教雖證法中無，而由得證故、方能說法故，此言教乃證中一分。	所以然者，明此一偈經教雖證法中無，而由得證故、方能說法故，此言教乃證中一分。	The reason for this is that although this one verse of the sutra teaching is not the Dharma that is realized, it is able to expound the Dharma because it is attained and realized. Therefore, this teaching is a part of realization.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c06_7']	要尋此言教，解無為法身、發聞思修慧等，然後得證。	要尋此言教，解無為法身、發聞思修慧等，然後得證。	One must seek this teaching in order to understand the unconditioned Dharma body and give rise to the wisdom of hearing, thinking, and cultivation, and then one can attain realization.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c07_18']	明知一偈經教能與佛果證法作因，勝七寶施福，故次明此挍量分也。	明知一偈經教能與佛果證法作因，勝七寶施福，故次明此挍量分也。	It is clear that this one verse of the sutra teaching is able to serve as the cause for the realized Dharma of the Buddha's fruition, surpassing the merit of giving the seven treasures. Therefore, the next section compares and clarifies this.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c10_4']	「三千大千世界」者，百億須彌、百億四天下、百億日月，上至有頂、下至風輪，名此為三千大千世界也。	「三千大千世界」者，百億須彌、百億四天下、百億日月，上至有頂、下至風輪，名此為三千大千世界也。	A world system consisting of a triple-thousand great one-thousand worlds refers to a hundred koṭīs of Sumerus, a hundred koṭīs of four continents, a hundred koṭīs of suns and moons, extending from the peak of existence below to the wind-wheel, which is called a world system consisting of a triple-thousand great one-thousand worlds.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c13_1']	「滿中七寶持用布施得福多不」者，如來將欲以受持經教一四句偈挍量勝如故，先引七寶施福以問須菩提得福多不也。	「滿中七寶持用布施得福多不」者，如來將欲以受持經教一四句偈挍量勝如故，先引七寶施福以問須菩提得福多不也。	If one were to fill it with the seven treasures and use it for giving, would the merit obtained be much? The Tathāgata, about to compare the superiority of upholding a single four-line verse of the sutra teaching, first cites the merit of giving the seven treasures to ask Subhūti if the merit obtained would be much.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c13_5']	「甚多。	「甚多。	Very much.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c13_9']	婆伽婆！	婆伽婆！	Bhagavān!
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c13_12']	甚多。	甚多。	Very much.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c15_6']	脩伽陀」者，今須菩提將明施者用寶既多得福亦多，敬答於佛，故仰并如來二號也。	脩伽陀」者，今須菩提將明施者用寶既多得福亦多，敬答於佛，故仰并如來二號也。	Sugata - now Subhūti is about to clarify that the giver uses many treasures, and the obtained blessings are also many. He respectfully answers the Buddha, thus he praises the Tathāgata's two epithets.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c16_6']	「婆伽婆」者，西國正音，義翻云一切種智人。	「婆伽婆」者，西國正音，義翻云一切種智人。	Bhagavān is the correct pronunciation in the Western regions, which translates as one who has the knowledge of all modes.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c16_18']	「脩伽陀」者，漢翻善逝。	「脩伽陀」者，漢翻善逝。	Sugata is translated as well-gone in Chinese.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c17_8']	略舉二德答佛施福多也。	略舉二德答佛施福多也。	Briefly citing two virtues to answer the Buddha's question about the great blessings of giving.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c19_5']	「何以故」者，問如來何以故，明此三千七寶布施得福甚多譬喻，故云何以故也。	「何以故」者，問如來何以故，明此三千七寶布施得福甚多譬喻，故云何以故也。	Why is it so? asks why the Tathāgata clarifies that the merit obtained from giving the seven treasures of the three thousand worlds is very great. Therefore, it says why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c21_14']	即答「是福德聚即非福德聚」，上言七寶布施得福甚多，今復云是福德聚即非福德聚，此二言何故前後相違？	即答「是福德聚即非福德聚」，上言七寶布施得福甚多，今復云是福德聚即非福德聚，此二言何故前後相違？	The answer is this accumulation of merit is not an accumulation of merit. Above it said that giving the seven treasures obtains much merit, but now it says this accumulation of merit is not an accumulation of merit. Why do these two statements contradict each other?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c22_15']	似須菩提失冥加力，謂此福甚多而似答不契。	似須菩提失冥加力，謂此福甚多而似答不契。	It seems that Subhūti lost the power of the dark blessings, thinking that this merit is very much and seems to be an inappropriate answer.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c23_9']	今須菩提申己不失冥加之力；	今須菩提申己不失冥加之力；	Now Subhūti extends his own power of the dark blessings that he has not lost;
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c27_9']	又亦非說多不當理，我得冥加力故，玄知下如來以七寶施福雖多，是有漏福德不能遠趣佛果故，挍量不及持經四句偈得出世無為法身無漏福多故，此採取下挍量之意也。	又亦非說多不當理，我得冥加力故，玄知下如來以七寶施福雖多，是有漏福德不能遠趣佛果故，挍量不及持經四句偈得出世無為法身無漏福多故，此採取下挍量之意也。	and also it is not that speaking much is not in accord with principle, because I have obtained the power of the dark blessings, I profoundly know that although the merit of giving the seven treasures is great, it is a merit with outflows and cannot go far to the fruition of Buddhahood, therefore, comparing it to the merit of upholding four lines of verse from the sūtra, which produces the merit of the unconditioned Dharma body with no outflows, this merit is greater, this is the meaning of collecting and comparing below.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0820c28_6']	「是福德聚」者，是七寶布施福德聚也。	「是福德聚」者，是七寶布施福德聚也。	This accumulation of merit refers to the accumulation of merit from giving the seven treasures.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a01_6']	「非福德聚」者，明此福雖多，是取相因，但感人天有漏果報，非是得出世間無漏福德聚也。	「非福德聚」者，明此福雖多，是取相因，但感人天有漏果報，非是得出世間無漏福德聚也。	Not an accumulation of merit clarifies that although this merit is great, it is a cause of grasping characteristics and only gives rise to the conditioned fruits of humans and gods, it is not an accumulation of merit that can produce the unconditioned merit of the world beyond.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a03_6']	「是故如來說福德聚福德聚」者，前既明七寶布施非福德聚者，恐人謂今無福名非福德。	「是故如來說福德聚福德聚」者，前既明七寶布施非福德聚者，恐人謂今無福名非福德。	Therefore the Tathagata speaks of the accumulation of blessings and virtues, the accumulation of blessings and virtues - since it was previously clarified that the giving of the seven treasures is not the accumulation of blessings and virtues, it is feared that people will think that now there are no blessings and virtues.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a04_4']	以如此義故，引如來說有二種福德聚：	以如此義故，引如來說有二種福德聚：	For this reason, it cites the Tathagata's statement of two kinds of accumulations of blessings and virtues:
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a05_1']	一是有漏福德聚，二是無漏福德聚。	一是有漏福德聚，二是無漏福德聚。	one is the accumulation of contaminated blessings and virtues, and the other is the accumulation of uncontaminated blessings and virtues.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a07_10']	有漏若非福德者，但應有一，不應說二，是故當知有世間福，但非出世福耳，故知不得聞非福德謂全無漏也。	有漏若非福德者，但應有一，不應說二，是故當知有世間福，但非出世福耳，故知不得聞非福德謂全無漏也。	If the contaminated were not blessings and virtues, there should only be one, not two. Therefore, one should know that there are worldly blessings and virtues, but they are not the blessings and virtues of the supramundane. Therefore, one should know that one should not hear not blessings and virtues and think that it completely excludes the uncontaminated.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a08_18']	從「佛言」以下至「七寶布施」，將欲挍量故，還牒上譬喻來也。	從「佛言」以下至「七寶布施」，將欲挍量故，還牒上譬喻來也。	From The Buddha said up to giving the seven treasures, in order to make a comparison, it restates the parable above.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a11_9']	「若復有人於此經中」至「不可數」者，明有人受持此經四句偈福，能得無為法身無量福德，勝前七寶施福不可算數也。	「若復有人於此經中」至「不可數」者，明有人受持此經四句偈福，能得無為法身無量福德，勝前七寶施福不可算數也。	If there are people in this sutra up to incalculable means that it is explained that the merit of upholding this sutra's four-line verse can attain the immeasurable merit of the unconditioned Dharma body, surpassing the merit of giving the seven treasures mentioned above, which cannot be calculated.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a13_18']	此言「一四句偈」者，莫問偈及長行，但使表法身理足者以為一四句偈，不取說因緣事等經文為一四句偈也。	此言「一四句偈」者，莫問偈及長行，但使表法身理足者以為一四句偈，不取說因緣事等經文為一四句偈也。	As for the phrase one four-line verse, it does not matter whether it is a verse or prose, as long as it expresses the principle of the Dharma body sufficiently, it is considered one four-line verse. It does not take the sutra text that explains causes and conditions, etc. as one four-line verse.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a14_4']	「何以故？	「何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a14_8']	須菩提！	須菩提！	Subhūti!
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a15_19']	一切諸佛菩提皆從此經出，諸佛如來皆從此經生」者，此釋前挍量中疑。	一切諸佛菩提皆從此經出，諸佛如來皆從此經生」者，此釋前挍量中疑。	All the buddhas' enlightenment comes from this sutra, and all the buddhas and tathāgatas are born from this sutra explains the doubt in the previous comparison.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a16_11']	「何以故」者，有人疑云：	「何以故」者，有人疑云：	Why is it so? means that some people doubt:
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a17_11']	何故七寶布施是其了因，其功甚多，得福乃少？	何故七寶布施是其了因，其功甚多，得福乃少？	Why is it that giving the seven treasures is a direct cause, its merit is very great, but the blessings obtained are few?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a18_11']	受持一偈亦是了因，其功甚少，得福乃多。	受持一偈亦是了因，其功甚少，得福乃多。	Even upholding a single verse is also a condition for enlightenment, and its merit is extremely small, yet the blessings obtained are vast.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a18_18']	故云何以故也。	故云何以故也。	Therefore, it says why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a20_5']	答意明前布施是取相之福，唯獲三界報，不能得三種佛菩提；	答意明前布施是取相之福，唯獲三界報，不能得三種佛菩提；	The answer clarifies that the previous giving is a merit of grasping at characteristics, only obtaining the rewards of the three realms, and cannot attain the three kinds of Buddha's enlightenment;
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a22_1']	受持此經，獲不取相福，能得三種佛菩提，是故受持一偈之福勝七寶施福。	受持此經，獲不取相福，能得三種佛菩提，是故受持一偈之福勝七寶施福。	Upholding this sūtra, one obtains the merit of not grasping at characteristics, and can attain the three kinds of Buddha's enlightenment. Therefore, the merit of upholding a single verse surpasses the merit of giving the seven treasures.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a23_9']	所以然者，以此一偈經教，用功雖少得福乃多，能出生佛果故。	所以然者，以此一偈經教，用功雖少得福乃多，能出生佛果故。	The reason for this is that although the effort used in this single verse of sūtra teaching is small, the blessings obtained are vast, because it can give rise to the fruition of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a25_12']	受持此經生聞乃至能得十地證智，終與法身作其了因，與報、應二佛以為生因故，所以勝也。	受持此經生聞乃至能得十地證智，終與法身作其了因，與報、應二佛以為生因故，所以勝也。	Upholding this sūtra gives rise to hearing, and one can finally attain the wisdom of the ten grounds and realize the Dharma body, serving as a condition for the reward and response two Buddhas, and therefore it is superior.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a27_14']	此言「阿耨菩提」者，即無為法身無上正遍知正道也，明此法身古今一定湛然常住，體非作法。	此言「阿耨菩提」者，即無為法身無上正遍知正道也，明此法身古今一定湛然常住，體非作法。	The phrase supreme, perfect enlightenment refers to the unconditioned Dharma body, the supreme, perfect knowledge, and the right path. It clarifies that this Dharma body is eternally fixed and always abiding, and its essence is not a created dharma.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821a29_2']	受持此經教，但能作其了因，不能作生因，故言皆從此經出。	受持此經教，但能作其了因，不能作生因，故言皆從此經出。	Upholding this sutra only serves as the enabling cause, not the producing cause, so it says all emerge from this sutra.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b01_15']	「一切諸佛如來皆從此經生」者，有受持此經言教，能與報佛如來以為生因。	「一切諸佛如來皆從此經生」者，有受持此經言教，能與報佛如來以為生因。	All buddhas and tathagatas are born from this sutra means that upholding the teachings of this sutra can serve as the producing cause for the reward-body tathagata.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b04_8']	以此報佛要因受持此經，發菩提心，始從習種終于解行，修世間功德智慧，逕一大阿僧祇行道證初地，名為見道。	以此報佛要因受持此經，發菩提心，始從習種終于解行，修世間功德智慧，逕一大阿僧祇行道證初地，名為見道。	This reward-body buddha must rely on upholding this sutra, giving rise to the bodhi mind, beginning from the stage of practice and ending at the stage of understanding and practice, cultivating worldly merits and wisdom, passing through one great asankheya eon practicing the path and realizing the first ground, which is called seeing the path.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b06_9']	逕三阿僧祇，十地行滿金剛心謝，即本有之性顯時有二種莊嚴，用此詶往因，故名為報因。	逕三阿僧祇，十地行滿金剛心謝，即本有之性顯時有二種莊嚴，用此詶往因，故名為報因。	Passing through three asankheya eons, the practices of the ten grounds are fulfilled, and the vajra mind is eliminated. At that time, the originally existent nature manifests with two kinds of adornments, repaying the past causes with this, which is called the reward cause.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b08_9']	受持經教依而修行，報得佛果，用義說了為生，故言從此經生，非如世間法辨體為生也。	受持經教依而修行，報得佛果，用義說了為生，故言從此經生，非如世間法辨體為生也。	Relying on the sutra teachings to cultivate practice, one attains the fruition of Buddhahood. The meaning is explained as arising, therefore it is said to arise from this sutra, not like worldly dharmas which take substance as arising.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b09_10']	若報佛為生因，所生為當是有為、為是無為？	若報佛為生因，所生為當是有為、為是無為？	If the fruition Buddha is the cause of arising, is what is produced conditioned or unconditioned?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b10_13']	若是有為，則應無常，故下經引須彌山王喻釋也。	若是有為，則應無常，故下經引須彌山王喻釋也。	If it is conditioned, then it should be impermanent, therefore the sutra below uses the analogy of Mount Sumeru to explain.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b11_11']	若應佛藉經教從生因生者，應是實佛。	若應佛藉經教從生因生者，應是實佛。	If the responsive Buddha arises from the cause of the sutra teachings, then it should be the true Buddha.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b12_17']	若是實佛，何故上經云「無有定法應佛如來得三菩提」也。	若是實佛，何故上經云「無有定法應佛如來得三菩提」也。	If it is the true Buddha, why did the sutra above say there is no definite dharma that the responsive Tathagata attains the enlightenment of the three knowledges?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b13_17']	若定非實佛，供養此佛為有福德、為無福德？	若定非實佛，供養此佛為有福德、為無福德？	If it is definitely not the true Buddha, is there merit or no merit in making offerings to this Buddha?
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b14_10']	此疑下微塵喻，經未當釋也。	此疑下微塵喻，經未當釋也。	This doubt will be explained by the analogy of fine dust in the sutra below.
['ZH_T25_1512_004:0821b15_15']	既有報佛，必有應佛影像之用，故應佛亦言從此經生也。	既有報佛，必有應佛影像之用，故應佛亦言從此經生也。	Since there is the fruition Buddha, there must be the responsive Buddha with the function of reflection, therefore the responsive Buddha is also said to arise from this sutra.

The doubter cites the Buddha's statement about receiving the prediction to create a difficulty of something that can be grasped, and should still be answered with the meaning of something that cannot be grasped. Why does he say that there is truly nothing to attain in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi? This is an incorrect answer.

The answer clarifies that the prediction made by Dīpaṃkara Buddha in the past was only verbal language, and verbal language is the nature of sound, therefore it can be grasped and spoken of. It is not the realized Dharma that can be grasped or spoken of, and thus it can be established that it cannot be grasped or spoken of.

The meaning of the answer clarifies that although the realized Dharma is beyond words, it can be spoken of because it can be realized. By investigating this verbal expression, one can still realize it, and therefore the teachings are the Dharma, not non-Dharma.
