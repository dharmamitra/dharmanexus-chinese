['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c17_0']	然此迹門，談其因果及以自他，使一代教門	然此迹門，談其因果及以自他，使一代教門	Now, this chapter on the traces [of the Buddha's life] discusses its causes and effects, as well as self and others, causing the teachings of the entire lifetime [of the Buddha]
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c18_5']	融通入妙故。	融通入妙故。	to be harmonized and enter the marvelous.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c19_9']	凡諸義釋，皆約四教及以五味，意在開教，悉入醍醐。	凡諸義釋，皆約四教及以五味，意在開教，悉入醍醐。	Therefore, all the explanations of the meaning are based on the four teachings and the five flavors, with the intention of revealing the teachings and causing them all to enter into the finest nectar.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c21_16']	觀心乃是教行樞機，仍且略點，寄在諸說或存或沒，非部正意，故縱有施設託事附法，或辯十觀列名而已。	觀心乃是教行樞機，仍且略點，寄在諸說或存或沒，非部正意，故縱有施設託事附法，或辯十觀列名而已。	Contemplating the mind is the pivot of the teachings and practices. It is briefly pointed out and entrusted to various explanations, sometimes present and sometimes absent. It is not the main meaning of the text, so even if there are arrangements based on events or the Dharma, or if the ten contemplations are discussed and their names are listed,
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c23_1']	所明理境、智行、位法，能化所化意在能詮，詮中咸妙。	所明理境、智行、位法，能化所化意在能詮，詮中咸妙。	the principles of reality, wisdom, practices, stages, and the teachings of the teacher and the taught that are clarified are intended to be in the expounding. All within the expounding is marvelous.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c25_11']	為辯詮內始末自他故，具演十妙搜括一化，出世大意罄無不盡，故不可不了十妙大綱，故撮十妙為觀法大體。	為辯詮內始末自他故，具演十妙搜括一化，出世大意罄無不盡，故不可不了十妙大綱，故撮十妙為觀法大體。	In order to discuss the beginning and end, self and others within the expounding, the ten marvelous [aspects] are fully expounded to search out the entire teaching of the Buddha's life, leaving nothing of the great intention of appearing in the world unexhausted. Therefore, one cannot fail to understand the great framework of the ten marvelous [aspects]. Therefore, the ten marvelous [aspects] are summarized as the great essence of the method of contemplation.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c26_10']	若解迹妙，本妙非遙，應知但是離合異耳。	若解迹妙，本妙非遙，應知但是離合異耳。	If one understands the marvelous traces, the marvelous origin is not far away. One should know that they are only different in terms of separation and combination.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c26_20']	因果義一，自他何殊？	因果義一，自他何殊？	The meaning of cause and effect is one, so how different are self and others?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0702c27_14']	故下文云，本迹雖殊、不思議一。	故下文云，本迹雖殊、不思議一。	Therefore, the text below says, The origin and traces are different, but the inconceivable is one.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a01_3']	況體宗用秖是自他因果法故，況復教相秖是分別前之四章，使前四章與諸文永異，若曉斯旨則教有所歸。	況體宗用秖是自他因果法故，況復教相秖是分別前之四章，使前四章與諸文永異，若曉斯旨則教有所歸。	Moreover, the essence, purport, and function are just the dharmas of self and others, cause and effect. Moreover, the characteristics of the teachings are just the distinctions of the previous four chapters, making the previous four chapters and the other texts completely different. If one understands this meaning, then the teachings have a place to return.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a03_4']	一期縱橫不出一心，三千世間即空假中，理境乃至利益咸爾，則止觀十乘，成今自行因果；	一期縱橫不出一心，三千世間即空假中，理境乃至利益咸爾，則止觀十乘，成今自行因果；	The entire period, whether horizontal or vertical, does not go beyond the one mind. The three thousand worlds are emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle. The principle realm and even the benefits are all like this. Then the ten realizations of the Mohe Zhiguan become the cause and effect of one's own practice now;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a03_16']	起教一章，成今化他能所。	起教一章，成今化他能所。	The chapter on initiating the teaching becomes the ability and function of transforming others now.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a04_18']	則彼此昭著，法華行成，使功不唐捐，所詮可識。	則彼此昭著，法華行成，使功不唐捐，所詮可識。	Then this and that are clearly distinguished, and the practice of the Lotus Sutra is accomplished, so that the effort is not wasted, and what is expounded can be recognized.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a05_7', 'ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a05_10']	故更以十門收攝十妙。🔽何者？	故更以十門收攝十妙。🔽何者？	Therefore, I will further use ten gates to include the ten marvels.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a08_1']	為實施權則不二而二，開權顯實則二而不二，法既教部咸開成妙，故此十門不二為目，一一門下以六即檢之。	為實施權則不二而二，開權顯實則二而不二，法既教部咸開成妙，故此十門不二為目，一一門下以六即檢之。	If the real is used to establish the provisional, then the non-dual is dual. If the provisional is revealed and the real is manifested, then the dual is non-dual. Since the Dharma and the teachings are all revealed as wonderful, these ten gates have non-duality as their focus. Each gate should be examined with the six identities.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a09_8']	本門已廣引誠證，此下但直申一理，使一部經旨皎在目前。	本門已廣引誠證，此下但直申一理，使一部經旨皎在目前。	The main part has already extensively cited authentic evidence. From here on, it simply straightforwardly presents one principle, making the meaning of the entire sutra clear before one's eyes.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a14_2']	一者、色心不二門，二者、內外不二門，三者、修性不二門，四者、因果不二門，五者、染淨不二門，六者、依正不二門，七者、自他不二門，八者、三業不二門，九者、權實不二門，十者、受潤不二門。	一者、色心不二門，二者、內外不二門，三者、修性不二門，四者、因果不二門，五者、染淨不二門，六者、依正不二門，七者、自他不二門，八者、三業不二門，九者、權實不二門，十者、受潤不二門。	The first is the gate of the non-duality of form and mind, the second is the gate of the non-duality of internal and external, the third is the gate of the non-duality of cultivation and nature, the fourth is the gate of the non-duality of cause and effect, the fifth is the gate of the non-duality of defilement and purity, the sixth is the gate of the non-duality of the dependent and the proper, the seventh is the gate of the non-duality of self and others, the eighth is the gate of the non-duality of the three karmas, the ninth is the gate of the non-duality of the provisional and the real, and the tenth is the gate of the non-duality of being moistened.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a14_13']	是中第一，從境妙立名；	是中第一，從境妙立名；	Among them, the first is named based on the wonderful realm;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a15_3']	第二第三，從智行立名；	第二第三，從智行立名；	The second and third are named based on wisdom and practice;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a15_12']	第四，從位法立名；	第四，從位法立名；	Fourth, the name is established based on the stage and Dharma;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a16_6']	第五第六第七，從感應神通立名；	第五第六第七，從感應神通立名；	Fifth, sixth, and seventh, the name is established based on spiritual powers in response;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a16_17']	第八第九，從說法立名；	第八第九，從說法立名；	Eighth and ninth, the name is established based on expounding the Dharma;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a17_7']	第十，從眷屬利益立名。	第十，從眷屬利益立名。	Tenth, the name is established based on the benefits of the retinue.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a19_6']	一、色心不二門者，且十如境乃至無諦，一一皆可總別二意，總在一念，別分色心。	一、色心不二門者，且十如境乃至無諦，一一皆可總別二意，總在一念，別分色心。	First, the gate of the non-duality of form and mind: Moreover, the ten suchnesses of the realm up to the non-ultimate truth, each can be understood in two ways, general and specific. Generally, they are in one thought, specifically, they are divided into form and mind.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a19_9']	何者？	何者？	What is it?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a21_1']	初十如中，相唯在色，性唯在心，體、力、作、緣義兼色心，因、果唯心，報唯約色；	初十如中，相唯在色，性唯在心，體、力、作、緣義兼色心，因、果唯心，報唯約色；	In the first ten suchnesses, characteristics are only in form, nature is only in mind, essence, power, function, and conditions are both in form and mind, cause and effect are only in mind, and retribution is only in form;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a21_15']	十二因緣苦業兩兼，惑唯在心；	十二因緣苦業兩兼，惑唯在心；	The twelve links of dependent arising are both suffering and karma, and afflictions are only in mind;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a22_8']	四諦則三兼色心，滅唯在心；	四諦則三兼色心，滅唯在心；	The four truths are both in form and mind, and cessation is only in mind;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a23_3']	二諦三諦皆俗具色心、真中唯心；	二諦三諦皆俗具色心、真中唯心；	The two truths and three truths are both in form and mind, and the true and middle are only in mind;
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a23_13']	一實及無，準此可見。	一實及無，準此可見。	The one true and the non-existent can be seen according to this.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a25_1']	既知別已，攝別入總，一切諸法無非心性，一性無性三千宛然。	既知別已，攝別入總，一切諸法無非心性，一性無性三千宛然。	Having understood the distinctions, subsume the distinctions into the totality. All dharmas are none other than the nature of mind, one nature without nature, the three thousand are still distinct.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a27_3']	當知心之色心即心名變，變名為造，造謂體用，是則非色非心而色而心，唯色唯心良由於此。	當知心之色心即心名變，變名為造，造謂體用，是則非色非心而色而心，唯色唯心良由於此。	One should know that the form and mind of the mind are the mind itself, called transformation. Transformation is called creation, which refers to essence and function. This means that it is neither form nor mind, yet form and mind. Only form and only mind are due to this.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a27_17']	故知但識一念，遍見己他生佛。	故知但識一念，遍見己他生佛。	Therefore, one should know that by merely being aware of a single thought, one can fully see oneself, others, birth, and buddhas.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a28_16']	他生他佛尚與心同，況己心生佛寧乖一念？	他生他佛尚與心同，況己心生佛寧乖一念？	Since the birth of others and the buddhas of others are still the same as the mind, how could one's own mind, birth, and buddhas be contrary to a single thought?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703a29_9']	故彼彼境法，差差而不差。	故彼彼境法，差差而不差。	Therefore, each and every realm and dharma, different and yet not different.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b03_3']	二、內外不二門者，凡所觀境不出內外，外謂託彼依正色心，即空假中，即空假中妙，故色心體絕。	二、內外不二門者，凡所觀境不出內外，外謂託彼依正色心，即空假中，即空假中妙，故色心體絕。	Second, the gate of non-duality between internal and external. All observed realms are not beyond internal and external. External refers to relying on the form and mind of the environment and beings, immediately empty, provisional, and the middle way. The wondrous emptiness, provisional, and middle way causes the essence of form and mind to be cut off.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b05_11']	唯一實性無空假中，色心宛然豁同真淨，無復眾生七方便異，不見國土淨穢差品，而帝網依正終自炳然。	唯一實性無空假中，色心宛然豁同真淨，無復眾生七方便異，不見國土淨穢差品，而帝網依正終自炳然。	There is only one true nature, without emptiness, provisional existence, or the middle way. Form and mind are clearly the same as true purity. There are no more distinctions among sentient beings in the seven kinds of spiritual capacity, and one does not see the differences in purity and defilement of the lands. Yet the dependent and the principal in the Indra net are ultimately distinct.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b07_6']	所言內者，先了外色心一念無念，唯內體三千即空假中，是則外法全為心性。	所言內者，先了外色心一念無念，唯內體三千即空假中，是則外法全為心性。	As for the internal, first understand that external form and mind are not contemplated in a single thought. Only internally realize the three thousand as emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle. This is then the external dharmas completely becoming the nature of the mind.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b09_5']	心性無外攝無不周，十方諸佛法界有情，性體無殊一切咸遍，誰云內外、色心、己他？	心性無外攝無不周，十方諸佛法界有情，性體無殊一切咸遍，誰云內外、色心、己他？	The nature of the mind is without externality, encompassing all that is not all-pervading. The Buddhas of the ten directions and the sentient beings of the Dharma realm, their natures and substance are without distinction, all pervading. Who says there is internal and external, form and mind, self and other?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b09_16']	此即用向色心不二門成。	此即用向色心不二門成。	This then uses the previously explained gate of the non-duality of form and mind to accomplish this.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b13_12']	三、修性不二門者，性德秖是界如一念，此內界如三法具足，性雖本爾，藉智起修，由修照性，由性發修，存性則全修成性，起修則全性成修，性無所移、修常宛爾。	三、修性不二門者，性德秖是界如一念，此內界如三法具足，性雖本爾，藉智起修，由修照性，由性發修，存性則全修成性，起修則全性成修，性無所移、修常宛爾。	Third, the gate of non-duality between cultivation and nature. The nature virtues are simply the realm and suchness of a single thought. Within this, the three dharmas of the realm and suchness are complete. Although the nature is originally so, it relies on wisdom to give rise to cultivation. Due to cultivation illuminating the nature, and due to the nature giving rise to cultivation, if the nature is preserved, then the entire cultivation becomes the nature. If cultivation is given rise to, then the entire nature becomes cultivation. The nature does not move, and cultivation is always apparent.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b13_17']	修又二種：	修又二種：	Cultivation is also of two kinds:
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b14_1']	順修、逆修。	順修、逆修。	顺修 and 逆修.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b14_15']	順謂了性為行，逆謂背性成迷。	順謂了性為行，逆謂背性成迷。	顺 refers to understanding the nature as practice. 逆 refers to turning one's back on the nature and becoming deluded.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b15_14']	迷了二心，心雖不二，逆順二性，性事恒殊。	迷了二心，心雖不二，逆順二性，性事恒殊。	The two minds of delusion and understanding, although the mind is non-dual, the two natures of顺 and 逆, the nature and phenomena are always different.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b17_9']	可由事、不移心，則令迷修成了，故須一期迷了，照性成修，見性修心，二心俱泯。	可由事、不移心，則令迷修成了，故須一期迷了，照性成修，見性修心，二心俱泯。	It can be done through phenomena without moving the mind, and cause deluded cultivation to become accomplished. Therefore, one must for a period of time illuminate the nature through delusion and understanding, and see the nature and cultivate the mind, with the two minds both disappearing.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b18_15']	又了順修對性有離有合，離謂修性各三，合謂修二性一。	又了順修對性有離有合，離謂修性各三，合謂修二性一。	Moreover, understanding and顺 cultivation correspond to the nature with separation and combination. Separation means that cultivation and nature each have three. Combination means that cultivation has two and the nature is one.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b19_16']	修二各三，共發性三，是則修雖具九，九秖是三。	修二各三，共發性三，是則修雖具九，九秖是三。	The two cultivations each have three, together forming three natures. Although cultivation has nine, the nine are only three.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b21_6']	為對性明修故，合修為二，二與一性如水為波，二亦無二亦如波水。	為對性明修故，合修為二，二與一性如水為波，二亦無二亦如波水。	In order to clarify cultivation in contrast to nature, cultivation is combined into two, and the two and the one nature are like water and waves. The two are also non-dual, just like waves and water.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b22_8']	應知性指三障，是故具三，修從性成，成三法爾。	應知性指三障，是故具三，修從性成，成三法爾。	It should be known that nature refers to the three obstacles, and therefore it is complete with three. Cultivation is accomplished from nature, and the three are accomplished as a matter of course.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b23_7']	達無修性、唯一妙乘，無所分別，法界洞朗。	達無修性、唯一妙乘，無所分別，法界洞朗。	Understanding that there is no cultivation and nature, there is only the wonderful vehicle, without any discrimination, and the Dharma realm is completely illuminated.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b23_16']	此由內外不二門成。	此由內外不二門成。	This is accomplished through the gate of non-duality between internal and external.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b25_15']	四、因果不二門者，眾生心因既具三軌，此因成果名三涅槃，因果無殊始終理一。	四、因果不二門者，眾生心因既具三軌，此因成果名三涅槃，因果無殊始終理一。	Fourth, the gate of non-duality between cause and effect. Since the mind-cause of sentient beings is already complete with the three tracks, this cause becomes the result, which is called the three nirvanas. Cause and effect are no different, and the principle is one from beginning to end.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b26_8']	若爾因德已具，何不住因？	若爾因德已具，何不住因？	If so, since the virtues of the cause are already complete, why not abide in the cause?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b26_17']	但由迷因各自謂實。	但由迷因各自謂實。	It is only because of the delusion of the cause that each considers it to be real.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b27_18']	若了迷性實，唯住因故，久研此因，因顯名果。	若了迷性實，唯住因故，久研此因，因顯名果。	If one understands that the nature of delusion is real, one only abides in the cause. Therefore, by thoroughly investigating this cause, the cause manifests and is called the result.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703b29_5']	秖緣因果理一，用此一理為因，理顯無復果名，豈可仍存因號？	秖緣因果理一，用此一理為因，理顯無復果名，豈可仍存因號？	It is precisely because the principle of cause and effect is one that this single principle is used as the cause. When the principle is revealed, there is no longer the name of effect. How can the name of cause still be retained?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c01_9']	因果既泯，理性自亡，秖由亡智親疎，致使迷成厚薄。	因果既泯，理性自亡，秖由亡智親疎，致使迷成厚薄。	When cause and effect are both eliminated, the principle of reality itself disappears. It is only due to the near and far of the eliminated wisdom that delusion becomes thick or thin.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c02_8']	迷厚薄故，強分三惑，義開六即，名智淺深。	迷厚薄故，強分三惑，義開六即，名智淺深。	Because of the thickness or thinness of delusion, the three delusions are forcefully divided, the six identities are opened up in meaning, and the names of wisdom are shallow or deep.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c05_17']	故如夢勤加、空名惑絕，幻因既滿鏡像果圓，空像雖即義同，而空虛像實，像實故稱理本有，空虛故迷轉成性，是則不二而二立因果殊，二而不二始終體一。	故如夢勤加、空名惑絕，幻因既滿鏡像果圓，空像雖即義同，而空虛像實，像實故稱理本有，空虛故迷轉成性，是則不二而二立因果殊，二而不二始終體一。	Therefore, like diligently practicing in a dream, the empty name of delusion is eliminated. When the illusory cause is fulfilled, the mirror image of the effect is complete. Although the empty image is the same in meaning, the empty is virtual and the image is real. Because the image is real, it is called the originally existent principle. Because the empty is virtual, delusion turns into the nature. This means that although non-dual and dual, cause and effect are distinguished. Although dual and not dual, the essence is the same from beginning to end.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c06_19']	若謂因異果，因亦非因，曉果從因，因方克果。	若謂因異果，因亦非因，曉果從因，因方克果。	If it is said that the cause is different from the effect, the cause is also not a cause. Understanding that the effect comes from the cause, the cause then accomplishes the effect.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c07_18']	所以三千在理同名無明，三千果成咸稱常樂。	所以三千在理同名無明，三千果成咸稱常樂。	Therefore, the three thousand in principle are all called ignorance. The three thousand when the effect is accomplished are all called permanence and bliss.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c08_17']	三千無改無明即明，三千並常俱體俱用。	三千無改無明即明，三千並常俱體俱用。	The three thousand are unchanging, with ignorance being precisely enlightenment, and the three thousand are both the essence and the function.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c09_7']	此以修性不二門成。	此以修性不二門成。	This is accomplished through the gate of the non-duality of cultivation and essence.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c11_10']	五、染淨不二門者，若識無始，即法性為無明，故可了今即無明為法性。	五、染淨不二門者，若識無始，即法性為無明，故可了今即無明為法性。	Fifth, the gate of the non-duality of defilement and purity. If one understands that from the beginningless beginning, the dharma-nature is precisely ignorance, then one can understand that now, ignorance is precisely the dharma-nature.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c13_4']	法性之與無明遍造諸法，名之為染，無明之與法性遍應眾緣，號之為淨。	法性之與無明遍造諸法，名之為染，無明之與法性遍應眾緣，號之為淨。	The dharma-nature and ignorance create all dharmas, which are called defilements. Ignorance and the dharma-nature respond to various conditions, which are called purity.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c15_18']	濁水清水，波濕無殊，清濁雖即由緣，而濁成本有，濁雖本有而全體是清，以二波理通、舉體是用，故三千因果俱名緣起。	濁水清水，波濕無殊，清濁雖即由緣，而濁成本有，濁雖本有而全體是清，以二波理通、舉體是用，故三千因果俱名緣起。	Turbid water and clear water, waves and wetness are no different. Although clarity and turbidity are due to conditions, turbidity is originally present. Although turbidity is originally present, its entire essence is clarity. Since the principle of the two waves is inclusive, and the entire essence is function, therefore the three thousand causes and effects are all called dependent arising.

The nature of a thought-moment is always so. The principle of dependent arising is one. Within the one principle, purity and impurity are distinguished. Separately, there are six impure and four pure. Generally, the ten are both pure and impure.

The three thousand have not yet been revealed, verifying that the essence is still deluded. Therefore, in the stage of similarity, the six sense faculties are universally illuminating.

Because of illumination, the three thousand are always complete. Because of blocking, the principle of emptiness and the middle is ultimately empty all day long, and yet one still illuminates all day long. Without moving from this thought, one universally responds to all places. According to the stimulus, one bestows the pure and defiled, which are both negated.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c24_19']	亡淨穢故以空以中，仍由空中轉染為淨。	亡淨穢故以空以中，仍由空中轉染為淨。	Because the pure and defiled are negated, one relies on emptiness and the middle. Still, due to emptiness and the middle, one transforms the defiled into the pure.
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0703c25_17']	由了染淨空中自亡，此以因果不二門成。	由了染淨空中自亡，此以因果不二門成。	Because one understands the defiled and pure, emptiness and the middle are naturally negated. This is accomplished through the gate of cause and effect being non-dual.

Having already realized the non-duality of the one essence of Śākyamuni, it is precisely because of the three thousand in a single thought since beginningless [time].

Since the primary and secondary are both in one mind, how can the one mind be divided into subject and object?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0704a01_16']	雖無能所，依正宛然，是則理性、名字、觀行，已有不二依正之相，故使自他因果相攝。	雖無能所，依正宛然，是則理性、名字、觀行，已有不二依正之相，故使自他因果相攝。	Although there is no subject and object, the primary and secondary are still distinct. This means that in principle, name, and contemplation, there is already the appearance of non-dual primary and secondary. Therefore, self and other, cause and effect, are mutually inclusive.

From beginning to end, it does not change, and there is no obstruction between the large and small. The principle of cause and effect is the same, so how can the primary and secondary be different?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0704a08_18']	故淨穢之土、勝劣之身，塵身與法身量同，塵國與寂光無異，是則一一塵剎一切剎，一一塵身一切身，廣狹勝劣難思議，淨穢方所無窮盡，若非三千空假中，安能成茲自在用。	故淨穢之土、勝劣之身，塵身與法身量同，塵國與寂光無異，是則一一塵剎一切剎，一一塵身一切身，廣狹勝劣難思議，淨穢方所無窮盡，若非三千空假中，安能成茲自在用。	Therefore, the pure and defiled lands, the superior and inferior bodies, the defiled body and the Dharma body are the same in size, the defiled country and the quiescent light are no different. This means that in each particle there are all lands, and in each particle there are all bodies. The vastness and inferiority are difficult to imagine, and the pure and defiled directions are endless. If it were not for the emptiness, provisional, and middle of the three thousand dharmas, how could this free and easy function be accomplished?
['ZH_T46_1927_001:0704a09_14']	如是方知生佛等，彼此事理互相收。	如是方知生佛等，彼此事理互相收。	In this way, one should know that sentient beings and Buddhas are equal, and the phenomena and principles of self and others mutually include each other.

The transformation and manifestation of each realm does not go beyond a single thought, and the mutual arising of each land does not go beyond the quiescent light.

Because the buddhas have perfected the three thousand principles, they are able to respond. The responses are everywhere, and the joy of the capacities is not mistaken.

If a single form were placed in front of it and it could not reflect the image, then the principle of the mirror would be exhausted and the events of the form would not be transmitted.

Removing the dust is done by the person polishing it. The reflection of the image has nothing to do with the polisher. Using this analogy, the general purport of contemplating the Dharma can be understood.

Since beginningless time, perfuming has been either provisional or real. The provisional and real are due to perfuming, but the principle is always equal.

The Buddha's fruition faculties are also neither provisional nor real, but become the provisional and real response. When the capacities of sentient beings and the response of the Buddha meet, the body and land are impartial, and all are the realm of the Dharma, which is always the eternally quiescent and illuminated.

Just as the realm originally possesses the three, relying on principle to give rise to understanding is called wisdom.
