['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791a26_17']	五義皆與藏對辨，皆正斥三藏名同義異，以由境同觀別故也。	五義皆與藏對辨，皆正斥三藏名同義異，以由境同觀別故也。	006	The five meanings are all distinguished from the Tripiṭaka, and all correctly refute the Tripiṭaka's same name but different meaning, because the object is the same but the contemplation is different.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791a28_4']	「諸法究竟」等者，小亦名空而非空義，小空無旨真義不成。	「諸法究竟」等者，小亦名空而非空義，小空無旨真義不成。	006	The ultimate of all dharmas and so forth, the Lesser Vehicle also calls it emptiness but it is not the meaning of emptiness, the Lesser Vehicle's emptiness has no purport, the true meaning is not established.

['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791a29_19']	「三藏所明生法二空」者，或一或三，具如目連章中已辨。	「三藏所明生法二空」者，或一或三，具如目連章中已辨。	006	The two kinds of emptiness of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena explained in the Tripiṭaka may be one or three, as already explained in the chapter on Maudgalyāyana.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b01_12']	「衍明實相真空」者，義通真中。	「衍明實相真空」者，義通真中。	006	The true aspect of emptiness explained in the Mahāyāna the meaning is common to the truth and the middle.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b03_13']	此正用真，密兼中道，故此正與目連章意，及為國王長者所說，并下釋〈觀眾生品〉大旨略同。	此正用真，密兼中道，故此正與目連章意，及為國王長者所說，并下釋〈觀眾生品〉大旨略同。	006	This is the correct use of truth, and it also secretly includes the middle way. Therefore, this is roughly the same as the meaning of the chapter on Maudgalyāyana, what is said for the king and elders, and the explanation of the chapter on contemplating sentient beings below.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b04_17']	餘非全無，不及三處，此中經意亦正明通義，故顯說通。	餘非全無，不及三處，此中經意亦正明通義，故顯說通。	006	The other two are not completely without, but they are not as good as the three places. The meaning of the sūtra here also correctly clarifies the meaning of the common, and therefore it is clearly said to be common.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b06_7']	故知此之四義稍隱不彰，於寂滅中偏顯圓別，是故文中指大涅槃。	故知此之四義稍隱不彰，於寂滅中偏顯圓別，是故文中指大涅槃。	006	Therefore, we know that these four meanings are slightly hidden and not manifested. In the state of quiescent extinction, the perfect and distinct are biased and manifested. Therefore, the text points to the great nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b06_20']	二、「三藏」下，對辨結示。	二、「三藏」下，對辨結示。	006	Second, The Tripiṭaka and below, comparing and distinguishing to conclude and demonstrate.

['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b08_14']	此是通塗者，秖以此章義含三意，故曰通塗，故前後文多皆含於中道之說。	此是通塗者，秖以此章義含三意，故曰通塗，故前後文多皆含於中道之說。	006	This is the common path. Because this chapter's meaning includes the three meanings, it is called the common path. Therefore, many texts before and after often include the teachings of the middle way.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b09_13']	故此中云亦得即是等者，教法通深故也。	故此中云亦得即是等者，教法通深故也。	006	Therefore, it is said here that it can also be the same, because the teaching method is commonly profound.

['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b10_21']	荊溪云：	荊溪云：	006	Jingshan says:
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b11_11']	秖緣前含，是故問答欲令意顯。	秖緣前含，是故問答欲令意顯。	006	It is precisely because of the previous inclusion that there is the question and answer, wishing to make the meaning clear.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b12_19']	故問意云，為顯四榮應以榮折，雖著義字苦等仍存，故云枯也。	故問意云，為顯四榮應以榮折，雖著義字苦等仍存，故云枯也。	006	Therefore, the meaning of the question is: In order to manifest the four glories, one should use glory to break, although the meaning of suffering still exists, therefore it is called withered.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b13_9']	但是四枯，顯榮何在？	但是四枯，顯榮何在？	006	But this is only the four withered, where is the glory manifested?
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b13_15']	二、答，二：	二、答，二：	006	Second, the answer, in two parts:
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b13_23']	初、明即枯是榮。	初、明即枯是榮。	006	First, clarifying that the withered is precisely the glorious.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b14_3']	荊溪云：	荊溪云：	006	Jingshan says:
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b14_17']	答意者，破拙入巧，巧拙自殊。	答意者，破拙入巧，巧拙自殊。	006	The meaning of the answer is to break through the clumsy and enter the skillful. The skillful and clumsy are different by themselves.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b15_14']	意顯破拙即入中也，借結此拙而成枯意。	意顯破拙即入中也，借結此拙而成枯意。	006	The meaning is manifested by breaking through the clumsy and entering the middle. Borrowing the conclusion of this clumsiness forms the meaning of withering.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b16_9']	巧自成榮，故先入巧，入已見中。	巧自成榮，故先入巧，入已見中。	006	The skillful naturally forms the glorious, therefore first entering the skillful, and upon entering seeing the middle.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b17_16']	雙遊之義，枯即榮也，故引二鳥其義善成，故居士訶即名榮也。	雙遊之義，枯即榮也，故引二鳥其義善成，故居士訶即名榮也。	006	The meaning of the two birds flying together, the withered is precisely the glorious, therefore citing the two birds the meaning is well formed, therefore the layman's scolding is precisely called the glorious.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b20_11']	苦等一一皆云義故，故可結為非枯非榮，義字不間真中故也，故立不生不滅我與無我不二等言，況此通門元通妙理。	苦等一一皆云義故，故可結為非枯非榮，義字不間真中故也，故立不生不滅我與無我不二等言，況此通門元通妙理。	006	Each of suffering, etc., is said to have meaning, therefore it can be concluded as neither withered nor flourishing. The character meaning is not between the true and the middle, therefore the words non-arising, non-ceasing, self and non-self are not two, etc. are established. Moreover, this universal approach originally universally penetrates the wondrous principle.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b22_2']	「二鳥雙遊」者，〈鳥喻品〉云「一者迦隣提、二者鴛鴦，遊止共俱不相捨離。	「二鳥雙遊」者，〈鳥喻品〉云「一者迦隣提、二者鴛鴦，遊止共俱不相捨離。	006	As for the two birds flying together, the Parable of the Birds says: The first is the kalaviṅka, the second is the ruddy goose, they play and rest together, never leaving each other.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b22_13']	」古人多解，委如彼疏。	」古人多解，委如彼疏。	006	 Ancient people have many explanations, as detailed in that commentary.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b23_3']	今師以雄喻常、雌喻無常。	今師以雄喻常、雌喻無常。	006	Now the master takes the male to symbolize permanence and the female to symbolize impermanence.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b24_1']	生死有性善，故無常即常，如二鳥在下。	生死有性善，故無常即常，如二鳥在下。	006	Because samsara has the nature of good, impermanence is precisely permanence, like the two birds below.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b24_19']	涅槃有性惡，故常即無常，如二鳥飛高。	涅槃有性惡，故常即無常，如二鳥飛高。	006	Because nirvana has the nature of evil, permanence is precisely impermanence, like the two birds flying high.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b25_18']	是則在高在下雌雄共俱，雙遊並息其義皆成。	是則在高在下雌雄共俱，雙遊並息其義皆成。	006	This means that whether high or low, male and female are together, the meaning of flying together and resting together is all accomplished.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b27_1']	故今雖結枯名，枯即榮也，以二鳥不相捨離故。	故今雖結枯名，枯即榮也，以二鳥不相捨離故。	006	Therefore, although now concluding the withered name, withered is precisely flourishing, because the two birds never leave each other.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b28_2']	「無我法中有真我」者，此示《大經》迦葉歎佛文也。	「無我法中有真我」者，此示《大經》迦葉歎佛文也。	006	In the Dharma of no-self, there is the true self - this shows the passage in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra where Kāśyapa praises the Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791b29_16']	亦應例云無常中有常、苦中有樂、空有不空，悉是二鳥雙遊、即枯是榮意也。	亦應例云無常中有常、苦中有樂、空有不空，悉是二鳥雙遊、即枯是榮意也。	006	It should also be said that in impermanence there is permanence, in suffering there is bliss, in emptiness there is non-emptiness, all of which are the meaning of the two birds flying together and the withered tree being the flourishing tree.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791c01_7']	二、「淨名」下，明部意猶蜜。	二、「淨名」下，明部意猶蜜。	006	Second, The Vimalakīrti Sūtra clarifies that the meaning of the text is like honey.

['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791c02_7']	淨名結真等者，正出答意，具如向述。	淨名結真等者，正出答意，具如向述。	006	The Vimalakīrti Sūtra concludes with the true... This is the main point of the answer, as explained above.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791c03_1']	真即是中，雙遊之言必相即故。	真即是中，雙遊之言必相即故。	006	The true is the middle, and the phrase flying together must refer to mutual inclusion.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791c04_3']	不生不滅雖結無常，不專無常，以無常義仍通故。	不生不滅雖結無常，不專無常，以無常義仍通故。	006	Although non-arising and non-ceasing concludes with impermanence, it is not exclusively about impermanence, because the meaning of impermanence is still general.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791c05_1']	故宜斥於三藏二乘，令於此座成生酥益。	故宜斥於三藏二乘，令於此座成生酥益。	006	Therefore, it is appropriate to refute the Tripiṭaka and two vehicles, causing them to attain the benefit of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma on this very seat.
['ZH_T38_1779_006:0791c05_11']	三、諸比丘心得解脫。	三、諸比丘心得解脫。	006	Third, the bhikṣus attained liberation of the mind.

The conclusion of attaining arhatship verifies the previous explanation of the distinct and perfect principles, which clarifies the power of the teaching, not the correct criticism of characteristics.
