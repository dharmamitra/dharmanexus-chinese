The antidote of elimination refers to the uninterrupted path that directly eliminates the obtainment of afflictions. The second, the antidote of upholding, refers to the path of liberation that immediately follows this. It upholds the obtainment of the elimination of the defiled dharmas of this category. According to this, the obtainment of defiled dharmas is unconditioned. It is not because the unconditioned is eliminated by the same category, the same type, and the same object. Therefore the correct principle states:

As for the passions that take the unconditioned as an object, they are the passions that have as their objects cessation and the path and that are associated with pure dharmas. The power of these passions attracts the possession that is their fruit. The words “the passions that do not take this as an object” refer to the passions that have as their objects cessation and the path and that are associated with impure dharmas. As for the words, “the cause and fruit of the passions of the three times,” this means that when these possessions are in the present, they are the outflow of past passions and are therefore called fruit. They are the condition as cause of future passions and are therefore called cause. There are possessions that can be born and there are possessions that cannot be born. However, these possessions are contrary to the actualities of the possession of the antidote to the passions that are to be eliminated. They hold the passions to be eliminated of the three times and therefore cause all passions that have as their objects this object and the passions that have as their objects other objects to continue in a series.
