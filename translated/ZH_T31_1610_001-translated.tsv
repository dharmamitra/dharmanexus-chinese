['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a08_2']	1 緣起分緣起分第一問曰：	1 緣起分緣起分第一問曰：	001	Chapter 1: The Arising of the Teaching, Part 1 Question:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a08_11']	佛何因緣說於佛性？	佛何因緣說於佛性？	001	For what causes and conditions did the Buddha teach about buddha-nature?
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a08_14']	答曰：	答曰：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a09_19']	如來為除五種過失、生五功德故，說一切眾生悉有佛性。	如來為除五種過失、生五功德故，說一切眾生悉有佛性。	001	The Tathāgata taught that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature in order to eliminate five kinds of faults and give rise to five kinds of merits.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a12_13']	除五種過失者，一為令眾生離下劣心故、二為離慢下品人故、三為離虛妄執故、四為離誹謗真實法故、五為離我執故。	除五種過失者，一為令眾生離下劣心故、二為離慢下品人故、三為離虛妄執故、四為離誹謗真實法故、五為離我執故。	001	As for eliminating the five kinds of faults, the first is in order to cause sentient beings to abandon inferior thoughts, the second is in order to cause those of low status to abandon arrogance, the third is in order to cause them to abandon false grasping, the fourth is in order to cause them to abandon slandering the true Dharma, and the fifth is in order to cause them to abandon grasping at self.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a15_6']	一為令眾生離下劣心者，有諸眾生未聞佛說有佛性理，不知自身必當有得佛義故，於此身起下劣想，不能發菩提心。	一為令眾生離下劣心者，有諸眾生未聞佛說有佛性理，不知自身必當有得佛義故，於此身起下劣想，不能發菩提心。	001	As for the first, in order to cause sentient beings to abandon inferior thoughts, there are sentient beings who, before hearing the Buddha teach the principle of buddha-nature, did not know that their own bodies would certainly attain buddhahood, and therefore gave rise to inferior thoughts about this body and were unable to give rise to the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a16_7']	今欲令其發心，捨下劣意故，說眾生悉有佛性。	今欲令其發心，捨下劣意故，說眾生悉有佛性。	001	Now, in order to cause them to give rise to the mind and abandon inferior thoughts, it is said that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a19_2']	二為離高慢心者，若有人曾聞佛說眾生有佛性故，因此發心，既發心已，便謂我有佛性故能發心，作輕慢意，謂他不能。	二為離高慢心者，若有人曾聞佛說眾生有佛性故，因此發心，既發心已，便謂我有佛性故能發心，作輕慢意，謂他不能。	001	Second, for those who wish to be free from the mind of arrogance, if there are people who have heard the Buddha say that sentient beings possess buddha-nature, they will give rise to the mind based on this. Once they have given rise to the mind, they will think, Because I possess buddha-nature, I am able to give rise to the mind, and give rise to thoughts of contempt, thinking that others are unable to do so.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a19_19']	為破此執故，佛說一切眾生皆有佛性。	為破此執故，佛說一切眾生皆有佛性。	001	In order to break this attachment, the Buddha says that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a21_12']	三為離虛妄執者，若人有此慢心，則於如理如量正智不得生顯故起虛妄。	三為離虛妄執者，若人有此慢心，則於如理如量正智不得生顯故起虛妄。	001	Third, for those who wish to be free from false grasping, if a person has this arrogant mind, then correct wisdom that accords with principle and reality will not be able to arise and manifest, and thus false grasping will occur.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a22_3']	虛妄者，是眾生過失。	虛妄者，是眾生過失。	001	False grasping is a fault of sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a22_8']	過失有二：	過失有二：	001	Faults are of two kinds:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a22_16']	一本無、二是客。	一本無、二是客。	001	First, non-existent; second, adventitious.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a24_1']	一本無者，如如理中本無人我，作人我執，此執無本。	一本無者，如如理中本無人我，作人我執，此執無本。	001	As for the first, non-existent, it is like grasping at a self in what accords with reality when there is originally no self in what accords with reality. This grasping is without basis.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a24_12']	由無本執故，起無明等。	由無本執故，起無明等。	001	Because of grasping without basis, ignorance and so forth arise.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a25_3']	由無明起業，由業起果報。	由無明起業，由業起果報。	001	Because of ignorance, karma arises; because of karma, retribution arises.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a26_7']	如此三種無實根本所執是無，故知能執皆成虛妄故。	如此三種無實根本所執是無，故知能執皆成虛妄故。	001	Since these three kinds do not have a real fundamental grasped object, they are nonexistent. Therefore, it is known that the grasper is all false.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787a28_7']	由於此執所起無明諸業果報並是虛妄故，無受者作者而於中執有，是虛妄故言本無。	由於此執所起無明諸業果報並是虛妄故，無受者作者而於中執有，是虛妄故言本無。	001	Because the ignorance, karma, and retribution that arise from this grasping are all false, there is no experiencer or doer, yet within it, grasping exists. This is false, so it is said to be originally nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b01_11']	二是客者，有為諸法皆念念滅無停住義，則能罵所罵二無所有，但初剎那為舊、次剎那為客。	二是客者，有為諸法皆念念滅無停住義，則能罵所罵二無所有，但初剎那為舊、次剎那為客。	001	Second, as guests: all conditioned dharmas cease moment by moment, without the meaning of abiding. Then, the one who scolds and the one scolded both do not exist. But the first moment is old, and the next moment is a guest.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b03_12']	能罵所罵起而即謝，是則初剎那是怨、次則非怨，以於客中作於舊執，此執不實故名虛妄。	能罵所罵起而即謝，是則初剎那是怨、次則非怨，以於客中作於舊執，此執不實故名虛妄。	001	The one who scolds and the one scolded arise and then disappear. This is then the enemy in the first moment, and in the next moment, it is not an enemy. Taking the guest to be the old, this grasping is unreal, so it is called false.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b04_2']	若起此執，正智不生。	若起此執，正智不生。	001	If this grasping arises, right wisdom does not arise.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b04_12']	為除此執，故說佛性。	為除此執，故說佛性。	001	In order to eliminate this grasping, the Buddha-nature is taught.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b05_6']	佛性者，即是人法二空所顯真如。	佛性者，即是人法二空所顯真如。	001	The Buddha-nature is precisely the true suchness revealed by the emptiness of both persons and dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b05_17']	由真如故，無能罵所罵。	由真如故，無能罵所罵。	001	Because of suchness, there is no one who is scolded or who scolds.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b06_8']	通達此理，離虛妄執。	通達此理，離虛妄執。	001	Penetrating this principle, one is free from false grasping.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b08_12']	四為除誹謗真實法者，一切眾生過失之事並是二空，由解此空故所起清淨智慧功德，是名真實。	四為除誹謗真實法者，一切眾生過失之事並是二空，由解此空故所起清淨智慧功德，是名真實。	001	Fourth, in order to eliminate those who slander the true Dharma, all the faults of sentient beings are both empty. By understanding this emptiness, the pure wisdom and merits that arise are called true reality.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b10_6']	言誹謗者，若不說佛性則不了空，便執實有，違謗真如，淨智功德皆不成就。	言誹謗者，若不說佛性則不了空，便執實有，違謗真如，淨智功德皆不成就。	001	As for slander, if the Buddha-nature is not spoken of, then emptiness is not understood, and one grasps at true existence, contradicting and slandering suchness. The pure wisdom and merits are all not accomplished.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b11_15']	五離我執者，若不見虛妄過失、真實功德，於眾生中不起大悲。	五離我執者，若不見虛妄過失、真實功德，於眾生中不起大悲。	001	Fifth, in order to eliminate the grasping of self, if one does not see false faults and true merits, then great compassion does not arise for sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b13_13']	由聞佛說佛性故，知虛妄過失、真實功德，則於眾生中起大悲心，無有彼此故除我執。	由聞佛說佛性故，知虛妄過失、真實功德，則於眾生中起大悲心，無有彼此故除我執。	001	Because of hearing the Buddha speak of the Buddha-nature, one knows false faults and true merits, and then gives rise to a mind of great compassion for sentient beings. Because there is no distinction between self and others, the grasping of self is eliminated.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b14_11']	為此五義因緣，佛說佛性生五種功德。	為此五義因緣，佛說佛性生五種功德。	001	For these five meanings and causes, the Buddha speaks of the Buddha-nature giving rise to five kinds of merits.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b16_2']	五功德者，一起正勤心、二生恭敬事、三生般若、四生闍那、五生大悲。	五功德者，一起正勤心、二生恭敬事、三生般若、四生闍那、五生大悲。	001	The five merits are: 1. Arousing a mind of right effort, 2. Giving rise to respectful service, 3. Giving rise to prajñā, 4. Giving rise to jñāna, 5. Giving rise to great compassion.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b17_1']	由五功德能翻五失，由正勤故，翻下劣心；	由五功德能翻五失，由正勤故，翻下劣心；	001	By the five merits, one is able to reverse the five faults. Due to right effort, one reverses the inferior mind;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b17_11']	由恭敬故，翻輕慢意；	由恭敬故，翻輕慢意；	001	Due to respect, one reverses the intention of slighting;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b18_1']	由般若故，翻妄想執；	由般若故，翻妄想執；	001	Due to prajñā, one reverses conceptual attachment;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b19_18']	由生闍那俗智，能顯實智及諸功德故，翻謗真法，由大悲心，慈念平等，故翻我執。	由生闍那俗智，能顯實智及諸功德故，翻謗真法，由大悲心，慈念平等，故翻我執。	001	By giving rise to jñāna, the worldly wisdom, one is able to manifest true wisdom and all merits, thus reversing the slander of the true Dharma. Due to the mind of great compassion, one equally thinks with loving-kindness, thus reversing the grasping of self.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b21_2']	翻我執者，由佛性故觀一切眾生二無所有，息自愛念；	翻我執者，由佛性故觀一切眾生二無所有，息自愛念；	001	Reversing the grasping of self is due to buddha-nature. Observing all sentient beings' two kinds of non-existence, one ceases self-cherishing;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b22_10']	觀諸眾生二空所攝，一切功德而得成就，是故於他而生愛念。	觀諸眾生二空所攝，一切功德而得成就，是故於他而生愛念。	001	Observing sentient beings' inclusion in the two kinds of emptiness, one attains the accomplishment of all merits. Therefore, one gives rise to cherishing others.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b22_20']	由般若故，滅自愛念；	由般若故，滅自愛念；	001	Due to prajñā, one extinguishes self-cherishing;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b23_9']	由大悲故，生他愛念。	由大悲故，生他愛念。	001	Due to great compassion, one gives rise to cherishing others.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b23_19']	由般若故，捨凡夫執；	由般若故，捨凡夫執；	001	Due to prajñā, one abandons the grasping of ordinary beings;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b24_8']	由大悲故，捨二乘執。	由大悲故，捨二乘執。	001	Because of great compassion, one abandons the attachments of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b24_18']	由般若故，不捨涅槃；	由般若故，不捨涅槃；	001	Because of prajñā, one does not abandon nirvāṇa;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b25_7']	由大悲故，不捨生死。	由大悲故，不捨生死。	001	Because of great compassion, one does not abandon saṃsāra.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b25_17']	由般若故，成就佛法；	由般若故，成就佛法；	001	Because of prajñā, one accomplishes the Buddha Dharma;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b26_6']	由大悲故，成熟眾生。	由大悲故，成熟眾生。	001	Because of great compassion, one brings sentient beings to maturity.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787b28_8']	由二方便住無住處，無有退轉速證菩提，滅五過失、生五功德，是故佛說一切眾生皆有佛性。	由二方便住無住處，無有退轉速證菩提，滅五過失、生五功德，是故佛說一切眾生皆有佛性。	001	By means of these two skillful means, one abides in the abode of no abode, without retrogression, and quickly realizes bodhi. One eliminates the five faults and gives rise to the five merits. Therefore, the Buddha says that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c01_14']	2 破執分1 破小乘執品佛性論破執分第二中破小乘執品第一復次佛性有無，成、破立義應知。	2 破執分1 破小乘執品佛性論破執分第二中破小乘執品第一復次佛性有無，成、破立義應知。	001	Chapter on Refuting the Attachments of the Lesser Vehicle, Part 2, Chapter 1 of the Treatise on Refuting Attachments and Establishing the Existence of Buddha-Nature. Next, one should understand the establishment and refutation of the doctrine of the existence or non-existence of buddha-nature.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c01_19']	破有三種：	破有三種：	001	Refutation is of three kinds:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c02_16']	一破小乘執、二破外道執、三破菩薩執。	一破小乘執、二破外道執、三破菩薩執。	001	1. Refuting the attachments of the lesser vehicle, 2. Refuting the attachments of non-Buddhists, 3. Refuting the attachments of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c04_5']	初破小乘執者，佛為小乘人說有眾生不住於性，永不般涅槃故。	初破小乘執者，佛為小乘人說有眾生不住於性，永不般涅槃故。	001	First, as for refuting the attachments of the lesser vehicle, the Buddha told those of the lesser vehicle that there are sentient beings who do not abide in their nature, because they will never attain parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c04_15']	於此生疑，起不信心。	於此生疑，起不信心。	001	They give rise to doubts about this and do not give rise to faith.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c04_18']	釋曰。	釋曰。	001	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c05_17']	所以生疑者，由佛說故，小乘諸部解執不同。	所以生疑者，由佛說故，小乘諸部解執不同。	001	The reason for giving rise to doubts is because of the Buddha's teachings. The various schools of the Lesser Vehicle interpret and uphold them differently.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c07_10']	若依分別部說，一切凡聖眾生並以空為其本，所以凡聖眾生皆從空出故。	若依分別部說，一切凡聖眾生並以空為其本，所以凡聖眾生皆從空出故。	001	If we follow the Vibhajyavādins, all ordinary and holy beings are fundamentally empty. The reason is that all ordinary and holy beings emerge from emptiness.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c08_5']	空是佛性，佛性者即大涅槃。	空是佛性，佛性者即大涅槃。	001	Emptiness is the Buddha-nature. The Buddha-nature is precisely great nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c09_18']	若依毘曇薩婆多等諸部說者，則一切眾生無有性得佛性，但有修得佛性。	若依毘曇薩婆多等諸部說者，則一切眾生無有性得佛性，但有修得佛性。	001	If we follow the Abhidharma, the Sarvâstivāda, and other schools, then all beings do not inherently possess the Buddha-nature, but only have the Buddha-nature that is cultivated.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c10_8']	分別眾生凡有三種：	分別眾生凡有三種：	001	Beings are generally of three kinds:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c11_10']	一定無佛性，永不得涅槃，是一闡提犯重禁者。	一定無佛性，永不得涅槃，是一闡提犯重禁者。	001	1. Those definitely without the Buddha-nature, who will never attain nirvāṇa, are icchantikas and those who commit the grave offenses.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c12_17']	二不定有無，若修時即得、不修不得，是賢善共位以上人故。	二不定有無，若修時即得、不修不得，是賢善共位以上人故。	001	2. Those whose existence or non-existence is uncertain. If they cultivate, they will attain it; if they do not cultivate, they will not attain it. This is because those above the stage of commoners and virtuous people are included in this category.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c13_8']	三定有佛性，即三乘人：	三定有佛性，即三乘人：	001	3. Those definitely possessing the Buddha-nature are the people of the three vehicles:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c15_15']	一聲聞從苦忍以上即得佛性，二獨覺從世法以上即得佛性，三者菩薩十迴向以上是不退位時得於佛性。	一聲聞從苦忍以上即得佛性，二獨覺從世法以上即得佛性，三者菩薩十迴向以上是不退位時得於佛性。	001	First, the śrāvaka attains buddha-nature from the stage of patience with suffering and above; second, the pratyekabuddha attains buddha-nature from the stage of worldly dharmas and above; third, the bodhisattva attains buddha-nature at the stage of irreversibility above the ten grounds of the bodhisattva.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c16_6']	所以然者，如經說：	所以然者，如經說：	001	The reason for this is as stated in the sūtra:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c17_1']	有眾生不住於性，永無般涅槃故。	有眾生不住於性，永無般涅槃故。	001	There are sentient beings who do not abide in nature, because they will never attain parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c17_6']	又阿鋡說：	又阿鋡說：	001	Moreover, the Abhidharma says:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c18_19']	佛十力中性力所照，眾生境界有種種性，乃至麁妙等界不同，故稱性力。	佛十力中性力所照，眾生境界有種種性，乃至麁妙等界不同，故稱性力。	001	Among the ten powers of the Buddha, the power of nature illuminates that the realm of sentient beings has various natures, and even the realms of coarseness and subtlety are not the same, so it is called the power of nature.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c19_4']	所以者何？	所以者何？	001	Why is this so?
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c19_15']	一切眾生有性無性異故。	一切眾生有性無性異故。	001	Because all sentient beings have different natures, with or without buddha-nature.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c20_18']	有佛性者則修種種妙行，無佛性者則起種種麁惡。	有佛性者則修種種妙行，無佛性者則起種種麁惡。	001	Those with buddha-nature cultivate various wonderful practices, while those without buddha-nature give rise to various coarse and evil [actions].
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c22_8']	是故學小乘人見此二說皆有道理，未知何者為定，故起疑心。	是故學小乘人見此二說皆有道理，未知何者為定，故起疑心。	001	Therefore, practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle see that both of these teachings are reasonable, but they do not know which one is definitive, so they give rise to doubt.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c23_10']	復次生不信心者，於二說中各偏一執，故不相信。	復次生不信心者，於二說中各偏一執，故不相信。	001	Furthermore, those who do not give rise to faith, in the two explanations, each grasp one side and therefore do not believe.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c23_13']	何者？	何者？	001	What is it?
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c24_8']	若從分別部說，則不信有無性眾生；	若從分別部說，則不信有無性眾生；	001	If following the Vibhajyavādins, then they do not believe in the existence of sentient beings without Buddha-nature;
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c25_6']	若薩婆多等部說，則不信皆有佛性故。	若薩婆多等部說，則不信皆有佛性故。	001	if following the Sarvâstivādins and others, then they do not believe that all have Buddha-nature.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c25_17']	明有佛性者問執無性曰：	明有佛性者問執無性曰：	001	Those who clarify the existence of Buddha-nature ask those who grasp the non-existence of Buddha-nature:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c26_12']	汝云何有無性眾生永不般涅槃？	汝云何有無性眾生永不般涅槃？	001	How can you say that sentient beings without Buddha-nature will never attain parinirvāṇa?
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c26_15']	答曰：	答曰：	001	They reply:
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c27_17']	眾生既有種種麁妙不同，故知理有有性、無性。	眾生既有種種麁妙不同，故知理有有性、無性。	001	Since sentient beings have various coarse and subtle differences, we know that there are those with Buddha-nature and those without.
['ZH_T31_1610_001:0787c29_12']	汝若不信有無性眾生永不涅槃，而信有眾生有種種麁妙等界者，是義不然？	汝若不信有無性眾生永不涅槃，而信有眾生有種種麁妙等界者，是義不然？	001	If you do not believe that sentient beings without Buddha-nature will never attain parinirvāṇa, but believe that there are sentient beings with various coarse and subtle realms, this is unreasonable.
