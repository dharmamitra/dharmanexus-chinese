This is because one does not understand the distinctions between the karmic rewards, dominant results, and outflow results obtained from the field and the thought of giving practiced many times. It means that in a past life one temporarily planted the cause of giving in a good field, and therefore attracted wealth and happiness.
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627b23_9']	然不數習能捨物思故於今生仍惟慳悋。	然不數習能捨物思故於今生仍惟慳悋。	013	However, one did not practice the thought of giving up one's possessions many times, and therefore in this life one is still stingy.

['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627b28_11']	若爾何故至與彼相違。	若爾何故至與彼相違。	013	If so, why is it said that the world arises from karma?
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627b29_4']	問　若由業異果有異者。	問　若由業異果有異者。	013	The question: If the distinctions in effects are due to the distinctions in karma,
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627b29_17']	且如人中內身外物俱從業生。	且如人中內身外物俱從業生。	013	then in the human realm, both the internal body and external objects arise from karma.
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c01_16']	何故業生外物欝金．旃檀等甚可愛樂。	何故業生外物欝金．旃檀等甚可愛樂。	013	Why is it that the external objects produced by karma, such as saffron and sandalwood, are very delightful,
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c02_7']	而內身形等不淨穢惡。	而內身形等不淨穢惡。	013	while the internal body and form are impure and foul?

['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c04_4']	答　業類不同　雜業生人感內身形常流不淨。	答　業類不同　雜業生人感內身形常流不淨。	013	The answer is: Karma is not the same. Mixed karma produces humans, causing the internal body to always flow with impurities.
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c05_1']	感外香等能對治彼　淨業生天。	感外香等能對治彼　淨業生天。	013	It causes external fragrances and so forth to be able to counteract that. Pure karma produces heavenly beings.

['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c08_6']	如是二業至身語意業。	如是二業至身語意業。	013	Thus, these two types of karma are divided into three: bodily, verbal, and mental karma.
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c08_13', 'ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c08_15']	此分二為三也。🔽論。	此分二為三也。 論。	013	This divides two into three.

['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c14_4']	謂業依身故名身業。	謂業依身故名身業。	013	That is to say, because karma relies on the body, it is called body karma.
['ZH_T41_1822_013:0627c14_13']	業性即語故名語業。	業性即語故名語業。	013	Because the nature of karma is speech, it is called speech karma.
