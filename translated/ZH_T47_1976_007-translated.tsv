['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406b17_13']	如佛在時有一比丘得四禪，生增上慢，謂得阿羅漢，不復求進。	如佛在時有一比丘得四禪，生增上慢，謂得阿羅漢，不復求進。	007	When the Buddha was present, there was a bhikshu who attained the four dhyanas, gave rise to conceit, thinking he had attained arhatship, and no longer sought progress.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406b19_3']	命欲盡時，見有四禪中陰相來，便生邪見謂無涅槃，佛為欺我！	命欲盡時，見有四禪中陰相來，便生邪見謂無涅槃，佛為欺我！	007	When his life was about to end, he saw the signs of the intermediate existence in the four dhyanas coming, and gave rise to wrong views, thinking there is no nirvana, and the Buddha deceived me!

When his life ended, he was immediately reborn in Avici Hell.

['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c01_13']	五、菩薩初發心時生如來家者。	五、菩薩初發心時生如來家者。	007	5. Bodhisattvas who, upon first arousing the mind, are born in the family of the Tathāgatas.

['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c04_16']	一、菩薩生人中者，如《般若經》云：	一、菩薩生人中者，如《般若經》云：	007	First, when a bodhisattva is born among humans, as the Prajnaparamita Sutra says:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c07_10']	「有菩薩人中命終，還生人中者，除阿毘跋致，是菩薩根鈍，不能疾與般若波羅蜜相應，諸陀羅尼門、三昧門，不能疾現在前。	「有菩薩人中命終，還生人中者，除阿毘跋致，是菩薩根鈍，不能疾與般若波羅蜜相應，諸陀羅尼門、三昧門，不能疾現在前。	007	There are bodhisattvas who, after passing away among humans, are reborn among humans again. Except for those who are irreversible, these bodhisattvas have dull faculties and are unable to quickly accord with prajnaparamita. The doors of dharani and samadhi do not quickly appear before them.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c09_4']	」夫人中火宅，百苦相纏，唯大菩薩處之則無染累，如鵝入水水不令濕。	」夫人中火宅，百苦相纏，唯大菩薩處之則無染累，如鵝入水水不令濕。	007	The human realm is like a burning house, with a hundred sufferings entangling one. Only great bodhisattvas dwelling there are unstained and unfettered, like a goose entering water without being wet.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c10_9']	若諸小菩薩，非深種善根，尺進丈退，何由得諸三昧？	若諸小菩薩，非深種善根，尺進丈退，何由得諸三昧？	007	If the various lesser bodhisattvas have not deeply planted good roots, they retreat a zhang for every step forward. By what means can they attain various samadhis?
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c13_11']	如舍利弗千六十劫行菩薩道，欲渡布施河時，有乞人來乞其眼，舍利弗出一眼與之，乞者得眼，于舍利弗前嚊之，唾而棄地，又以脚蹹。	如舍利弗千六十劫行菩薩道，欲渡布施河時，有乞人來乞其眼，舍利弗出一眼與之，乞者得眼，于舍利弗前嚊之，唾而棄地，又以脚蹹。	007	Like Shariputra, who practiced the bodhisattva path for 1,600 kalpas. When he was about to cross the river of giving, a beggar came and asked for his eyes. Shariputra took out an eye and gave it to him. The beggar got Shariputra's eye, sniffed it in front of him, spat on the ground, and kicked it with his foot.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c13_18']	舍利弗思惟言：	舍利弗思惟言：	007	Śāriputra thought,
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c14_17']	「如此弊人等，難可度也，不如自調早脫生死。	「如此弊人等，難可度也，不如自調早脫生死。	007	Such inferior people are difficult to save. It's better to tame oneself and quickly escape birth and death.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c15_12']	」思惟是已，于菩薩道退迴小乘。	」思惟是已，于菩薩道退迴小乘。	007	Having thought this, he turned away from the bodhisattva path and entered the Lesser Vehicle.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c16_11']	又如飛行仙人，以王夫人手觸，神通頓失。	又如飛行仙人，以王夫人手觸，神通頓失。	007	Also, like the flying sage who suddenly lost his spiritual powers when touched by the king's wife.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c17_9']	迦文往因，以歡喜丸媚藥，䁥就婬女。	迦文往因，以歡喜丸媚藥，䁥就婬女。	007	Kāśyapa in a past life, with betel nut and aphrodisiacs, approached a prostitute.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c17_19']	賢聖猶爾，何況初心。	賢聖猶爾，何況初心。	007	Even the sages are like this, let alone beginners.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c18_11']	豈若一念阿彌，三昧疾現；	豈若一念阿彌，三昧疾現；	007	How is it like a single thought of Amitābha, with samādhi quickly manifesting?
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c19_4']	寄質蓮邦，永離貪欲者哉！	寄質蓮邦，永離貪欲者哉！	007	Entrusting one's form to the Lotus Land, forever leaving off lustful desires!
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c19_7']	論曰：	論曰：	007	The treatise says:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c19_20']	「菩薩以不見現在佛故心鈍。	「菩薩以不見現在佛故心鈍。	007	Because bodhisattvas do not see the present Buddha, their minds are dull.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c21_1']	」即知菩薩常當近佛，以近佛根利，疾得般若故。	」即知菩薩常當近佛，以近佛根利，疾得般若故。	007	This means that bodhisattvas should always be near the Buddha, because being near the Buddha sharpens their faculties and they quickly attain prajñā.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c23_2']	二、菩薩生兜率天者，為一生補處菩薩，皆生兜率；	二、菩薩生兜率天者，為一生補處菩薩，皆生兜率；	007	Second, as for bodhisattvas being born in Tuṣita Heaven, it is because bodhisattvas destined to be reborn once more before attaining Buddhahood are all born in Tuṣita;
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c23_15']	菩薩欲隨下生者，亦生彼處。	菩薩欲隨下生者，亦生彼處。	007	Bodhisattvas who wish to follow those being reborn below are also born there.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c24_1']	《十疑論》曰：	《十疑論》曰：	007	The Ten Doubts Discourse says:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c25_19']	「兜率天宮是欲界，退位者多，又有女人，長諸天愛欲，天女微妙，諸天耽玩自不能捨；	「兜率天宮是欲界，退位者多，又有女人，長諸天愛欲，天女微妙，諸天耽玩自不能捨；	007	The Tuṣita Heaven Palace is in the desire realm, with many levels of retrogression, and there are also women. It increases the heavenly beings' love and desire. The heavenly maidens are subtle and wonderful, and the heavenly beings indulge in them and cannot let go of them by themselves;
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c27_13']	不如阿彌淨土，純一大乘清淨良伴，煩惱惡業，畢竟不起，遂致無生之位。	不如阿彌淨土，純一大乘清淨良伴，煩惱惡業，畢竟不起，遂致無生之位。	007	It is not as good as the pure land of Amitâbha, which is a pure companion of the Great Vehicle, where afflictions and evil karma never arise, and one finally attains the stage of non-arising.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c28_19']	如師子覺菩薩生彼，為受天樂，從去已來，總不見彌勒。	如師子覺菩薩生彼，為受天樂，從去已來，總不見彌勒。	007	Like the Bodhisattva Siṃhaprajñā, who was born there to experience heavenly bliss, from then on he never saw Maitreya again.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0406c29_13']	諸小菩薩尚著五欲，何況凡夫。	諸小菩薩尚著五欲，何況凡夫。	007	Even the lesser bodhisattvas are still attached to the five desires, let alone ordinary beings.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a02_1']	」又《彌勒上生經》得入正定，方始得生，更無方便接引之義。	」又《彌勒上生經》得入正定，方始得生，更無方便接引之義。	007	Moreover, the Sutra on Maitreya's Ascent to Birth states that one must enter right concentration before being able to be born there, and there is no meaning of being received and guided by skillful means.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a04_8']	是則兜率內院，尚不求生，何況欲界諸天妙欲之藪，豈有需飲而入焦石之鄉，避溺而沈大海之底者哉。	是則兜率內院，尚不求生，何況欲界諸天妙欲之藪，豈有需飲而入焦石之鄉，避溺而沈大海之底者哉。	007	This means that one does not even seek to be born in the inner courtyard of Tuṣita Heaven, let alone the mire of the wonderful desires of the heavens in the desire realm. How could there be someone who needs to drink and enters the land of burning rocks, or avoids drowning and sinks to the bottom of the great ocean?
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a05_17']	三、菩薩生長壽等天者，《智度論》曰：	三、菩薩生長壽等天者，《智度論》曰：	007	Third, as for bodhisattvas being reborn in heavens with long lifespans, the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a10_4']	「菩薩無方便入初禪，乃至行六波羅蜜，無方便者入初禪時不念眾生，住時起時不念眾生，但著禪味，不能與初禪和合行般若波羅蜜，是菩薩慈悲心薄故，功德薄少，為初禪果報所牽，生長壽天。	「菩薩無方便入初禪，乃至行六波羅蜜，無方便者入初禪時不念眾生，住時起時不念眾生，但著禪味，不能與初禪和合行般若波羅蜜，是菩薩慈悲心薄故，功德薄少，為初禪果報所牽，生長壽天。	007	Bodhisattvas without skillful means enter the first dhyāna, up to practicing the six perfections. Those without skillful means, when entering the first dhyāna, do not think of sentient beings, and when abiding and emerging, they do not think of sentient beings. They are only attached to the taste of dhyāna, and are unable to practice prajñā-pāramitā in union with the first dhyāna. Because these bodhisattvas' mind of compassion is thin, their merit is meager, and they are dragged by the fruits of the first dhyāna to be reborn in heavens with long lifespans.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a11_4']	」長壽天者，非有想非無想處，壽八萬大劫。	」長壽天者，非有想非無想處，壽八萬大劫。	007	As for heavens with long lifespans, it refers to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, with a lifespan of 80,000 great eons.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a13_1']	或有人言，一切無色定通名長壽天，以無形不可化故，不任得道，常是凡夫處故。	或有人言，一切無色定通名長壽天，以無形不可化故，不任得道，常是凡夫處故。	007	Some say that all formless concentrations are collectively called heavens with long lifespans, because they are without form and cannot be transformed, so they are not suitable for attaining the Way, and always dwell in the realm of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a13_18']	或說無想天名為長壽，亦不任得道故。	或說無想天名為長壽，亦不任得道故。	007	Some say that the heaven of non-perception is called long-lived, also because it is not suitable for attaining the Way.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a15_11']	或說從初禪至第四禪，除淨居天，皆名長壽，以著味邪見，善心難生故。	或說從初禪至第四禪，除淨居天，皆名長壽，以著味邪見，善心難生故。	007	Or it is said that from the first dhyāna up to the fourth dhyāna, excluding the Pure Abodes, are all called long-lived, because they are attached to flavors and have wrong views, and it is difficult for wholesome thoughts to arise.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a15_16']	如經中說：	如經中說：	007	As it is said in the sūtras:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a16_1']	「佛問比丘：	「佛問比丘：	007	The Buddha asked the bhikṣus:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a16_12']	『甲頭土多，地上土多？	『甲頭土多，地上土多？	007	'Is the amount of soil on the fingernail more, or is the amount of soil on the ground more?'
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a16_18']	』諸比丘言：	』諸比丘言：	007	The bhikṣus said:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a17_6']	『地上甚多，不可為喻。	『地上甚多，不可為喻。	007	'The amount on the ground is much more, it cannot be compared.'
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a17_10']	』佛言：	』佛言：	007	The Buddha said:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a18_12']	『天上命終還生人中者如甲頭土，墮地獄者如地土。	『天上命終還生人中者如甲頭土，墮地獄者如地土。	007	'Those who end their lives in the heavens and are reborn among humans are like the amount of soil on the fingernail, those who fall into the hells are like the amount of soil on the ground.'
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a18_18']	』」何以故？	』」何以故？	007	 Why is this?
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a20_14']	以本發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，或於禪中集諸福德，方得還生人中，聞佛法故。	以本發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，或於禪中集諸福德，方得還生人中，聞佛法故。	007	Because they originally gave rise to the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment, or accumulated various merits and virtues within the dhyānas, and only then were able to be reborn among humans, in order to hear the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a22_5']	若是最初發心求生淨土，即常得聞法，直至不退，豈有如是等過。	若是最初發心求生淨土，即常得聞法，直至不退，豈有如是等過。	007	If they first give rise to the mind and seek to be born in the Pure Land, then they will always get to hear the Dharma until they reach the stage of nonretrogression. How could there be such faults?
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a23_13']	四、菩薩生三界外者，有二種：	四、菩薩生三界外者，有二種：	007	Fourth, those bodhisattvas born outside the three realms are of two kinds:
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a25_18']	一、二乘三種菩薩，折伏現行煩惱，捨分段而生界外，悲智狹劣，于嚴土利他，不生喜樂，為如來所呵。	一、二乘三種菩薩，折伏現行煩惱，捨分段而生界外，悲智狹劣，于嚴土利他，不生喜樂，為如來所呵。	007	First, the three types of bodhisattvas of the two vehicles subdue the manifest afflictions, abandon the compounded, and are born in the unconditioned realm. Their compassion and wisdom are narrow and inferior, and they do not delight in adorning the lands and benefiting others, so they are reprimanded by the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a26_17']	若不迴心行六度等行，畢竟不入大乘智海。	若不迴心行六度等行，畢竟不入大乘智海。	007	If they do not turn their minds and practice the six pāramitās, etc., they will never enter the great vehicle's ocean of wisdom.
['ZH_T47_1976_007:0407a27_11']	二、法身菩薩，如《般若經》：	二、法身菩薩，如《般若經》：	007	Second, the dharmakāya bodhisattvas, as stated in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra:

When such people encounter the Buddha and hear the Mahayana teachings, they give rise to the aspiration for supreme perfect enlightenment, immediately practice the six perfections, enter the stage of bodhisattvas, and attain the stage of nonretrogression.

This person will take a long time, countless eons, perhaps reaching or perhaps not reaching, due to the thin causes and conditions of their previous lives' merit and virtue, and moreover being of dull faculties with an unstable mind, like one riding a sheep.
