['ZH_T37_1762_001:0363c23_13']	原夫諸佛憫念群迷隨機施化，雖歸元無二而方便多門，然於一切方便中求其至直捷至圓頓者，莫若念佛求生淨土。	原夫諸佛憫念群迷隨機施化，雖歸元無二而方便多門，然於一切方便中求其至直捷至圓頓者，莫若念佛求生淨土。	The Buddhas, out of compassion for the deluded masses, teach according to their capacities. Although the ultimate truth is non-dual, there are many skillful means. However, among all skillful means, if one seeks the most direct and the most perfect, nothing surpasses the practice of reciting the Buddha's name and seeking rebirth in the Pure Land.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0363c28_10']	又於一切念佛法門之中，求其至簡易至穩當者，莫若信願專持名號，是故淨土三經並行於世，而古人獨以《阿彌陀經》別為日課，豈非有見於持名一法普被三根，攝事理以無遺、統宗教而無外，尤不可思議也哉！	又於一切念佛法門之中，求其至簡易至穩當者，莫若信願專持名號，是故淨土三經並行於世，而古人獨以《阿彌陀經》別為日課，豈非有見於持名一法普被三根，攝事理以無遺、統宗教而無外，尤不可思議也哉！	Moreover, among all the methods of reciting the Buddha's name, if one seeks the most simple and the most reliable, nothing surpasses the practice of single-mindedly reciting the name with faith and resolve. Therefore, the three sūtras on the Pure Land circulate in the world, and the ancients alone took the Sutra on Amitābha Buddha as their daily recitation. Is this not because they saw that the practice of reciting the name universally benefits the three capacities, encompasses all phenomena and principles without exception, and includes all teachings and practices without exclusion? It is truly inconceivable!
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a01_3']	古來註疏代不乏人，世遠就湮所存無幾，雲棲和尚著為《疏鈔》，廣大精微；	古來註疏代不乏人，世遠就湮所存無幾，雲棲和尚著為《疏鈔》，廣大精微；	In the past, there have been many people who wrote commentaries, but as the years go by, fewer and fewer remain. Master Yunqi wrote a subcommentary that is vast and profound;

It is like the sun and moon in the sky, visible to all who have eyes. However, because the text is rich and the meaning is complex, with no discernible boundaries, beginners with shallow understanding may find it difficult to enter the stage of faith and resolve. Therefore, I have once again rashly attempted to write an essential commentary, not daring to compete with the two masters in difference, nor daring to force agreement with the two masters.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a06_16']	譬如側看成峯橫看成嶺，縱皆不盡廬山真境，要不失為各各親見廬山而已。	譬如側看成峯橫看成嶺，縱皆不盡廬山真境，要不失為各各親見廬山而已。	It is like looking at a peak from the side or looking at a ridge from the oblique, although neither fully captures the true scenery of Mount Lu, they are each a personal encounter with Mount Lu.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a07_6']	將釋經文五重玄義。	將釋經文五重玄義。	I will now explain the five profound meanings of the sutra text.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a08_17']	第一釋名者，此經以能說、所說人為名。	第一釋名者，此經以能說、所說人為名。	The first is the explanation of the title, which is named after the speaker and the person being spoken about in the sutra.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a11_9']	佛者，此土能說之教主，即釋迦牟尼如來，乘大悲願力生五濁惡世，以先覺而覺後覺，無法不知無法不見故名佛也。	佛者，此土能說之教主，即釋迦牟尼如來，乘大悲願力生五濁惡世，以先覺而覺後覺，無法不知無法不見故名佛也。	Buddha refers to the teacher who expounds the teachings in this land, namely Shakyamuni Tathagata. Riding on the power of great compassion and vows, he was born in the defiled world of the five turbidities, using his prior enlightenment to enlighten those who are yet to be enlightened. There is no Dharma he does not know and no Dharma he does not see, thus he is called the Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a13_5']	說者，悅所懷也，佛以度生為懷，眾生機熟，佛為應時說法令得度脫，故悅也。	說者，悅所懷也，佛以度生為懷，眾生機熟，佛為應時說法令得度脫，故悅也。	Expounds means to delight in what is in the mind. The Buddha's mind is to deliver sentient beings. When the capacities of sentient beings are ripe, the Buddha responds by expounding the Dharma in a timely manner to enable them to attain liberation, thus delighting them.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a15_6']	阿彌陀者，即所說彼土之導師，以四十八願接信願念佛眾生，令生極樂世界永階不退者也。	阿彌陀者，即所說彼土之導師，以四十八願接信願念佛眾生，令生極樂世界永階不退者也。	Amitabha refers to the guide of that land that is expounded. With forty-eight vows, he receives sentient beings who have faith, vows, and mindfulness of the Buddha, enabling them to be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss and forever attain irreversibility.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a16_4']	梵語阿彌陀，此云無量壽，亦云無量光。	梵語阿彌陀，此云無量壽，亦云無量光。	The Sanskrit word Amitabha means infinite life and also infinite light.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a18_7']	以要言之，功德智慧，神通道力，依正莊嚴，說法化度，一一無量，聊舉壽命、光明二事以為言端耳。	以要言之，功德智慧，神通道力，依正莊嚴，說法化度，一一無量，聊舉壽命、光明二事以為言端耳。	In brief, his merits, wisdom, spiritual powers, supernatural abilities, adornments of the environment and beings, expounding of the Dharma, and transforming and delivering [beings] are all infinite. He is merely mentioned by his two qualities of lifespan and light.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a20_6']	經者、訓法訓常，一切金口所宣通名為經，今對佛說阿彌陀五字、即是通別合為題也。	經者、訓法訓常，一切金口所宣通名為經，今對佛說阿彌陀五字、即是通別合為題也。	Sutra means teaching the Dharma and teaching permanence. All that is proclaimed by the golden mouth is called a sutra. Now, the five characters Amitabha Buddha are the combined general and specific title.

['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a22_17']	第二辨體者，諸大乘經皆以實相為正體。	第二辨體者，諸大乘經皆以實相為正體。	Second, in distinguishing the essence, all Mahayana sutras take true suchness as their main essence.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a23_3']	何謂實相？	何謂實相？	What is true suchness?
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364a23_15']	即現前一念心之自性是也。	即現前一念心之自性是也。	It is the intrinsic nature of the present moment of mind.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b01_12']	吾人現前一念心性，不在內、不在外、不在中間，非過去、非現在、非未來，非青黃赤白、非長短方圓、非香、非味、非觸、非法，覓之了不可得而不可言其無，具造百界千如而不可言其有，離一切緣慮分別相，而緣慮分別亦非離此實相別有自性，離一切語言文字相，而語言文字亦非離此實相別有自性。	吾人現前一念心性，不在內、不在外、不在中間，非過去、非現在、非未來，非青黃赤白、非長短方圓、非香、非味、非觸、非法，覓之了不可得而不可言其無，具造百界千如而不可言其有，離一切緣慮分別相，而緣慮分別亦非離此實相別有自性，離一切語言文字相，而語言文字亦非離此實相別有自性。	The nature of the present thought in our mind is not within, not without, not in between, not past, not present, not future, not blue, yellow, red, or white, not long, short, square, or round, not fragrant, not tasting, not tactile, not dharmic. Searching for it, it cannot be found, but it cannot be said to be nonexistent. It creates the myriad realms and suchnesses, but it cannot be said to be existent. It is apart from all conceptual and discriminating characteristics, yet conceptual and discriminating are not apart from this reality. It is apart from all characteristics of language and texts, yet language and texts are not apart from this reality.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b04_4']	以要言之，離一切相、即一切法，唯其離一切相故無相，惟其即一切法故無不相，無相無不相故不得已強名實相。	以要言之，離一切相、即一切法，唯其離一切相故無相，惟其即一切法故無不相，無相無不相故不得已強名實相。	In brief, it is apart from all characteristics and yet includes all dharmas. Because it is apart from all characteristics, it is without characteristics. Because it includes all dharmas, it is without that which is not characteristics. Because it is without characteristics and without that which is not characteristics, it is provisionally called reality by force.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b06_9']	實相之體非寂非照，而復寂而恒照、照而恒寂，照而恒寂強名為常寂光土，寂而恒照強名清淨法身。	實相之體非寂非照，而復寂而恒照、照而恒寂，照而恒寂強名為常寂光土，寂而恒照強名清淨法身。	The essence of reality is neither quiescent nor illuminating, yet it is always quiescent and always illuminating, and always illuminating and always quiescent. Being always illuminating and always quiescent is strongly named the eternally quiescent light land, and being always quiescent and always illuminating is strongly named the pure Dharma body.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b07_10']	又照而恒寂強名法身，寂而恒照強名報身。	又照而恒寂強名法身，寂而恒照強名報身。	Moreover, being always illuminating and always quiescent is strongly named the Dharma body, and being always quiescent and always illuminating is strongly named the reward body.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b08_9']	又性德寂照強名法身，修德寂照名報身。	又性德寂照強名法身，修德寂照名報身。	Moreover, the quiescence and illumination of inherent nature is strongly named the Dharma body, and the quiescence and illumination of cultivated virtue is named the reward body.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b09_15']	又修德照而恒寂名為受用身，修德寂而恒照強名應化身。	又修德照而恒寂名為受用身，修德寂而恒照強名應化身。	Moreover, the cultivated virtue of being always illuminating and always quiescent is named the enjoyment body, and the cultivated virtue of being always quiescent and always illuminating is strongly named the responsive transformation body.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b14_13']	當知寂照不二、性修不二、身土不二無非實相，實相無二亦無不二，是故舉體作依、作正、作法、作報、作自、作他，乃至能說所說、能度所度、能信所信、能願所願、能持所持、能生所生、能讚所讚，無非實相正印之所印也。	當知寂照不二、性修不二、身土不二無非實相，實相無二亦無不二，是故舉體作依、作正、作法、作報、作自、作他，乃至能說所說、能度所度、能信所信、能願所願、能持所持、能生所生、能讚所讚，無非實相正印之所印也。	One should know that quiescence and illumination are non-dual, nature and cultivation are non-dual, body and land are non-dual, and none of them is not the true aspect. The true aspect is non-dual and also not non-dual. Therefore, the entire body becomes the support, the correct, the Dharma, the reward, the self, the other, up to the expounder, the expounded, the one who is liberated, the one who is to be liberated, the one who has faith, the one who has vows, the one who upholds, the one who is born, the one who praises, and the one who is praised. None of them is not sealed by the true aspect's correct seal.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b16_7']	第三明宗者，宗是修行之要徑、會體之樞機，而萬行之綱領也。	第三明宗者，宗是修行之要徑、會體之樞機，而萬行之綱領也。	Third, clarifying the purport. The purport is the essential path of practice, the pivot of unifying with the essence, and the guiding principle of myriad practices.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b17_16']	提其綱則眾目皆張，挈其領則襟袖隨至，故次體之後應須辨宗。	提其綱則眾目皆張，挈其領則襟袖隨至，故次體之後應須辨宗。	If one grasps the main thread, all the details will be displayed. If one pulls the collar, the sleeves will follow. Therefore, after the essence, one should distinguish the purport.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b18_11']	此經以信願持名為修行之宗要。	此經以信願持名為修行之宗要。	This sūtra takes faith, vows, and chanting the name as the essential purport of practice.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b22_6']	非信不足以啟願，非願不足以導行，非持名妙行不足以滿其所願而證所信，是故經中先演極樂依正以生信，次勸應當發願以導行，次示七日持名以徑登不退。	非信不足以啟願，非願不足以導行，非持名妙行不足以滿其所願而證所信，是故經中先演極樂依正以生信，次勸應當發願以導行，次示七日持名以徑登不退。	Without faith, one cannot give rise to vows. Without vows, one cannot guide practice. Without the wonderful practice of chanting the name, one cannot fulfill one's vows and realize what one has faith in. Therefore, the sutra first expounds the pure land of ultimate bliss to give rise to faith, next it encourages one to give rise to vows to guide practice, and finally it shows how chanting the name for seven days can lead one directly to the stage of nonretrogression.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b24_7']	信則信自、信他、信因、信果、信事、信理，願則厭離娑婆欣求極樂，行則執持名號一心不亂。	信則信自、信他、信因、信果、信事、信理，願則厭離娑婆欣求極樂，行則執持名號一心不亂。	Faith means faith in oneself, faith in others, faith in causes, faith in effects, faith in events, and faith in principles. Vows mean being disgusted with the Sahā world and longing to seek ultimate bliss. Practice means single-mindedly and uninterruptedly chanting the name.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b26_9']	信自者，信我現前一念之心本非肉團亦非緣影，竪無初後、橫絕邊涯，終日隨緣、終日不變。	信自者，信我現前一念之心本非肉團亦非緣影，竪無初後、橫絕邊涯，終日隨緣、終日不變。	Faith in oneself means believing that the present thought in one's mind is originally neither flesh nor a reflection. Vertically it has no beginning or end, horizontally it has no boundaries. All day long it follows conditions, all day long it is unchanging.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364b29_11']	十方虛空微塵國土，元我一念心中所現之物，我今雖復昏迷倒惑，苟能一念回心，決定得生自己心中本具極樂，更無疑慮，是名信自。	十方虛空微塵國土，元我一念心中所現之物，我今雖復昏迷倒惑，苟能一念回心，決定得生自己心中本具極樂，更無疑慮，是名信自。	The worlds in the ten directions, as numerous as dust motes in the empty space, are originally objects manifested by a single thought in my mind. Although I am now confused and deluded, if I can turn my mind back in a single thought, I will definitely be reborn in the original bliss inherent in my own mind, without any doubt. This is called believing in oneself.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c03_11']	信他者，信彼釋迦如來決無誑語，彌陀世尊決無虛願，六方諸佛廣長舌決無二言，隨順諸佛真實教誨，決志求生更無疑惑，是名信他。	信他者，信彼釋迦如來決無誑語，彌陀世尊決無虛願，六方諸佛廣長舌決無二言，隨順諸佛真實教誨，決志求生更無疑惑，是名信他。	As for believing in others, it means believing that Shakyamuni Buddha never speaks false words, Amitabha Buddha never makes empty vows, and the Buddhas of the six directions never speak two different words. Following the true teachings of the Buddhas, one resolutely aspires to be reborn without any doubt. This is called believing in others.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c05_5']	信因者，深信散亂稱名猶為成佛種子，何況一心不亂安得不非生淨土因！	信因者，深信散亂稱名猶為成佛種子，何況一心不亂安得不非生淨土因！	As for believing in causes, it means deeply believing that even casually chanting the name is still a cause for becoming a Buddha, let alone single-minded, undisturbed concentration. How could it not be the cause for being reborn in the Pure Land?
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c05_10']	是名信因。	是名信因。	This is called believing in causes.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c08_6']	信果者，深信淨土上善聚會皆從念佛三昧得生，譬如種瓜得瓜、種豆得豆，亦如影必隨形、響必應聲，決無虛棄，是名信果。	信果者，深信淨土上善聚會皆從念佛三昧得生，譬如種瓜得瓜、種豆得豆，亦如影必隨形、響必應聲，決無虛棄，是名信果。	Believing in the effect means deeply believing that the Pure Land, the assembly of the highest goodness, all come from the samadhi of mindfulness of the Buddha, just like planting a melon and getting a melon, planting a bean and getting a bean, also like a shadow must follow a form, a sound must respond to a voice, there is definitely no waste, this is called believing in the effect.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c11_14']	信事者，深信只今現前一念不可盡故，所以依心所現一切十方世界亦不可盡，實有極樂國土在十萬億土之外，最極清淨莊嚴不同莊生寓言，是名信事。	信事者，深信只今現前一念不可盡故，所以依心所現一切十方世界亦不可盡，實有極樂國土在十萬億土之外，最極清淨莊嚴不同莊生寓言，是名信事。	Believing in the matter means deeply believing that only now, the present thought is inexhaustible, therefore, all the worlds of the ten directions that appear based on the mind are also inexhaustible, there really is the Land of Ultimate Bliss beyond ten trillion lands, the ultimate purity and adornments are not the same as Zhuangzi's allegorical statements, this is called believing in the matter.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c14_5']	信理者，深信極樂國土雖在十萬億土之遠，而實不出我只今現前介爾一念心外，以吾現前一念心性實無外故。	信理者，深信極樂國土雖在十萬億土之遠，而實不出我只今現前介爾一念心外，以吾現前一念心性實無外故。	Believing in the principle means deeply believing that although the Land of Ultimate Bliss is far away beyond ten trillion lands, it is actually not outside of my only present thought, because the nature of my present thought is truly without outside.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c17_17']	又復，深信西方若依正、若主伴，皆吾現前一念妙明真心中所現影，全事即理、全妄即真、全修即性、全他即自，我心遍故佛心亦遍，佛心遍故一切眾生心性亦遍。	又復，深信西方若依正、若主伴，皆吾現前一念妙明真心中所現影，全事即理、全妄即真、全修即性、全他即自，我心遍故佛心亦遍，佛心遍故一切眾生心性亦遍。	Moreover, deeply believe that the adornments of the West, whether the environment or the beings, are all reflections manifested by the wondrous and bright true mind of the present moment. The whole phenomenon is the principle, the whole falsity is the truth, the whole practice is the nature, and the whole other is the self. Because my mind is all-pervading, the Buddha's mind is also all-pervading. Because the Buddha's mind is all-pervading, the mind-nature of all sentient beings is also all-pervading.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c19_3']	譬一室千燈光光互遍，重重交攝不相妨礙，是名信理。	譬一室千燈光光互遍，重重交攝不相妨礙，是名信理。	It is like a room with a thousand lamps, each light pervading all the others, interpenetrating and supporting each other without obstruction. This is called believing in the principle.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c20_8']	如此信已，則娑婆即自心所感之穢，而自心穢理應厭離；	如此信已，則娑婆即自心所感之穢，而自心穢理應厭離；	Having such belief, then the Saha world is the impurity attracted by one's own mind, and the impurity of one's own mind should be abhorred;
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c22_15']	極樂即自心所感之淨，而自心之淨理應欣求，厭穢須捨至究竟方無可捨，欣淨須取至究竟方無可取。	極樂即自心所感之淨，而自心之淨理應欣求，厭穢須捨至究竟方無可捨，欣淨須取至究竟方無可取。	the Land of Ultimate Bliss is the purity attracted by one's own mind, and the purity of one's own mind should be joyfully sought. Abhorring impurity must be abandoned until the ultimate point where there is nothing to abandon; joyfully taking purity must be grasped until the ultimate point where there is nothing to grasp.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c23_3']	故《妙宗鈔》云：	故《妙宗鈔》云：	Therefore, the Notes on the Wondrous Summit says:
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c23_17']	取捨若極，與不取捨亦非異轍。	取捨若極，與不取捨亦非異轍。	If grasping and abandoning are ultimate, they are also not different from non-grasping and non-abandoning.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c25_9']	今設不從事於取捨，但尚不取不捨，即是執理廢事，既廢於事，理亦非圓。	今設不從事於取捨，但尚不取不捨，即是執理廢事，既廢於事，理亦非圓。	Now, if one does not engage in accepting and rejecting, but only upholds non-acceptance and non-rejection, this is clinging to principle and neglecting phenomena. Since phenomena are neglected, principle is also not perfect.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0364c27_7']	若達全事即理，則取亦即理、捨亦即理，一取一捨無非法界，故次信之後而明願也。	若達全事即理，則取亦即理、捨亦即理，一取一捨無非法界，故次信之後而明願也。	If one realizes that phenomena are entirely principle, then accepting is also principle, and rejecting is also principle. Every acceptance and every rejection is the Dharma realm. Therefore, after faith, aspiration is explained.
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0365a02_5']	言執持名號一心不亂者，名以召德，德既不可思議，故名號亦功德亦復不可思議，名號功德不可思議，故使散亂稱名為佛種，況執持至一心不亂，安有不徑登不退者乎！	言執持名號一心不亂者，名以召德，德既不可思議，故名號亦功德亦復不可思議，名號功德不可思議，故使散亂稱名為佛種，況執持至一心不亂，安有不徑登不退者乎！	As for upholding the name and being undistracted, the name is used to call forth virtue. Since the virtue is inconceivable, the name and virtue are also inconceivable. Since the name and virtue are inconceivable, even distractedly calling the name becomes a cause for Buddhahood. How much more so for upholding it to the point of single-minded non-distraction? How could one not quickly attain the stage of non-retrogression?
['ZH_T37_1762_001:0365a04_6']	然諸經所示淨土要行萬別千差，如觀像、觀想、禮拜、供養、五悔、六念等，一一行成皆生淨土；	然諸經所示淨土要行萬別千差，如觀像、觀想、禮拜、供養、五悔、六念等，一一行成皆生淨土；	However, the essential practices for attaining the Pure Land as shown in various sūtras are myriad and varied, such as contemplating images, visualization, prostration, making offerings, the five repentances, the six recollections, and so forth.

It can truly be called the foremost of skillful means, the unsurpassed definitive meaning among definitive meanings, and the most perfect of all perfect and sudden teachings.

When the cause is mentioned, the fruition will certainly follow. Therefore, faith, vows, and chanting the name of the Buddha are the main purport of the sutra.
