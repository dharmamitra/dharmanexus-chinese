['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a08_20']	第五段中云教修十善道者，身三口四意三，是欲界生天善，上者云四禪，色界業也。	第五段中云教修十善道者，身三口四意三，是欲界生天善，上者云四禪，色界業也。	In the fifth section, it says teaching the cultivation of the ten wholesome paths. The three of body, the four of speech, and the three of mind are the wholesome [actions] for rebirth in the heavens of the desire realm. The higher ones are said to be the four dhyānas, which are the karma of the form realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a09_20']	初禪滅憂、二禪滅苦、三禪滅喜、四禪唯寂靜。	初禪滅憂、二禪滅苦、三禪滅喜、四禪唯寂靜。	In the first dhyāna, sorrow is eliminated, in the second dhyāna, suffering is eliminated, in the third dhyāna, joy is eliminated, and in the fourth dhyāna, only tranquility remains.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a10_17']	云教住四無量心，此是有為中慈悲喜捨。	云教住四無量心，此是有為中慈悲喜捨。	It says teaching to abide in the four immeasurable minds. These are the immeasurable [minds] of loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity within the conditioned [realm].
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a11_13']	云教住四無色定，此是無色界定。	云教住四無色定，此是無色界定。	It says teaching to abide in the four formless concentrations. These are the concentrations of the formless realm.

['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a13_18']	云教住須陀洹果，謂初斷見惑，捨異生性，初獲聖性，入聖行流故，故名入流。	云教住須陀洹果，謂初斷見惑，捨異生性，初獲聖性，入聖行流故，故名入流。	It says teaching to abide in the fruit of stream-entry. This means initially severing the afflictions of the view of the transitory collection, abandoning the nature of an ordinary being, initially attaining the nature of a noble one, and entering the stream of the noble one's practice, thus it is called entering the stream.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a16_10']	云教住斯陀含果，此云一來，謂此聖者雖斷欲界六品惑，然為有餘三品未斷，令此聖者一度來欲界生，故名一來果。	云教住斯陀含果，此云一來，謂此聖者雖斷欲界六品惑，然為有餘三品未斷，令此聖者一度來欲界生，故名一來果。	It says teaching to abide in the fruit of once-returning. This is called one coming, meaning this noble one, although having severed the six types of afflictions of the desire realm, still has the remaining three types not yet severed. This causes this noble one to come to the desire realm once more, thus it is called the fruit of once-returning.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a18_11']	云教住阿那含果，此云不還，謂斷欲界九品惑盡，從此生色界，更不來欲界受生，故名不還。	云教住阿那含果，此云不還，謂斷欲界九品惑盡，從此生色界，更不來欲界受生，故名不還。	How does one abide in the fruit of non-returner? This is called non-returner, meaning one who has exhausted the nine grades of afflictions of the desire realm, and from here is reborn in the form realm, never again coming to the desire realm to take rebirth, thus called non-returner.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a19_10']	此十使中，見道疑未能明了，不入羅漢果。	此十使中，見道疑未能明了，不入羅漢果。	Among these ten afflictions, one is still unclear about doubt in the path of seeing and does not enter the fruit of arhatship.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a19_16']	如十使煩惱：	如十使煩惱：	Like the ten afflictions:
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a21_1']	一身見、二邊見、三見取、四戒取、五邪見，已前五為利使；	一身見、二邊見、三見取、四戒取、五邪見，已前五為利使；	1. The view of the self, 2. extreme views, 3. the grasping of views, 4. the grasping of precepts and observances, 5. wrong views - the first five are sharp afflictions;
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a22_5']	已後五為鈍使，見諦斷，六貪、七瞋、八癡、九慢、十疑。	已後五為鈍使，見諦斷，六貪、七瞋、八癡、九慢、十疑。	The latter five are dull afflictions, to be eliminated by seeing the truths. 6. Greed, 7. anger, 8. delusion, 9. pride, 10. doubt.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a22_16']	此五鈍使能迷隨行之事。	此五鈍使能迷隨行之事。	These five dull afflictions can obscure the matters that are followed.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a24_5']	此之十使，前五利使，須陀洹見諦之後伏之不起，後五鈍使薄。	此之十使，前五利使，須陀洹見諦之後伏之不起，後五鈍使薄。	Of these ten afflictions, the first five sharp afflictions are subdued by the stream-enterer after seeing the truths and do not arise. The latter five dull afflictions are slight.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a26_3']	斯陀含斷欲界六種惑，非無色界貪，於瞋癡慢三種微而且薄，現行不生，非種無故。	斯陀含斷欲界六種惑，非無色界貪，於瞋癡慢三種微而且薄，現行不生，非種無故。	The once-returner has eliminated the six types of afflictions of the desire realm, but not the craving of the formless realm. In terms of anger, delusion, and pride, there are three types that are subtle and thin, not arising in present activity, because their seeds have not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a27_2']	為上二界報且無瞋，為修定伏而現行不起。	為上二界報且無瞋，為修定伏而現行不起。	As for the upper two realms, there is no anger, and they are subdued through cultivation, so that they do not arise in present activity.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838a28_14']	須、斯二果有厭患，而不令增長，常求出世之心，以此不成三界沈淪種子。	須、斯二果有厭患，而不令增長，常求出世之心，以此不成三界沈淪種子。	The two fruits of the once-returner and non-returner have aversion, but do not allow them to increase. They always seek the mind of leaving the world, and thus do not form the seeds of sinking and drowning in the three realms.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b01_5']	阿那含厭令永息，唯有見道疑，以見道不分明，不能頓超三界業果。	阿那含厭令永息，唯有見道疑，以見道不分明，不能頓超三界業果。	The non-returner completely stops aversion, but only has doubts about the path of seeing. Because the path of seeing is not clear, they cannot suddenly transcend the karmic fruits of the three realms.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b02_4']	阿羅漢為見道無疑，三界業果一時盡故。	阿羅漢為見道無疑，三界業果一時盡故。	The arhat has no doubts about the path of seeing, and the karmic fruits of the three realms are exhausted at once.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b03_9']	望前三果，設斷九種煩惱，唯有疑在，不得名為斷煩惱。	望前三果，設斷九種煩惱，唯有疑在，不得名為斷煩惱。	Compared to the previous three fruits, even if one eliminates the nine types of afflictions, only the doubts remain, and it cannot be called the elimination of afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b04_8']	為見諦無明未明，總名厭伏，不得名斷。	為見諦無明未明，總名厭伏，不得名斷。	Because the ignorance of seeing the truth is not yet clear, it is all called aversion and suppression, and cannot be called elimination.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b07_1']	又羅漢、辟支佛但欣出世，淨土菩薩及空觀菩薩為但欣出世行六波羅蜜，總是折伏現行無明，不得名為永斷煩惱。	又羅漢、辟支佛但欣出世，淨土菩薩及空觀菩薩為但欣出世行六波羅蜜，總是折伏現行無明，不得名為永斷煩惱。	Moreover, Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas merely delight in transcending the world. Pure Land Bodhisattvas and Emptiness-Contemplation Bodhisattvas, who practice the six perfections with the aspiration to transcend the world, all subdue the active manifestations of ignorance, but cannot be said to have permanently severed afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b08_6']	為且以空觀折伏無明，不了無明從本已來是不動智佛。	為且以空觀折伏無明，不了無明從本已來是不動智佛。	For now, they use emptiness contemplation to subdue ignorance, but do not understand that ignorance has primordially been the immovable wisdom of the Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b10_6']	為不了根本，以空折伏使令不起，乃至十地但得意生身等，不名以如來一切種智生身。	為不了根本，以空折伏使令不起，乃至十地但得意生身等，不名以如來一切種智生身。	Because they do not understand the fundamental nature, they use emptiness to subdue it and prevent it from arising. Even up to the tenth ground, they only attain the mind-born body, and are not said to attain the body born of the Tathāgata's omniscience.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b12_1']	以作十真如等觀，斷十種麁重，不了無明本是如來根本智故、大用恒寂故。	以作十真如等觀，斷十種麁重，不了無明本是如來根本智故、大用恒寂故。	Because they cultivate the contemplations of the ten suchnesses and sever the ten kinds of coarseness, they do not understand that ignorance is primordially the fundamental wisdom of the Tathāgata, and therefore the great function is always quiescent.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b14_2']	一乘佛果教中，依佛果發心，初發心時達根本無明是根本無分別智，成差別智大用法門。	一乘佛果教中，依佛果發心，初發心時達根本無明是根本無分別智，成差別智大用法門。	In the teaching of the fruition of the One Vehicle Buddha-Fruit, one generates the resolve based on the Buddha-Fruit. When one first generates the resolve, one penetrates fundamental ignorance, which is the fundamental non-discriminating wisdom, and achieves the great Dharma door of discriminating wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b15_5']	初心之上圓滿一切諸佛共所乘門，名乘一切智乘。	初心之上圓滿一切諸佛共所乘門，名乘一切智乘。	The first stage of the mind is the complete attainment of the vehicle shared by all buddhas, called the vehicle of omniscience.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b17_1']	若智悲願行毫釐不似佛，信心亦不成，何況住佛所住、生在如來一切種智家。	若智悲願行毫釐不似佛，信心亦不成，何況住佛所住、生在如來一切種智家。	If wisdom, compassion, vows, and practices are even slightly different from the Buddha, faith will not be accomplished, let alone abiding in the abode of the Buddha, being born in the family of the Tathāgata's omniscience.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b19_6']	生為佛真子具諸佛事，以智不異、願行平等大悲不異、無限境界不異、過去未來劫差別與一念不異。	生為佛真子具諸佛事，以智不異、願行平等大悲不異、無限境界不異、過去未來劫差別與一念不異。	Being born as the true child of the Buddha, endowed with all the affairs of the Buddha, with wisdom being no different, vows and practices being equal, great compassion being no different, limitless realms being no different, and the distinctions of past and future kalpas being no different from a single thought.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b19_17']	應如是，定慧照之可見。	應如是，定慧照之可見。	One should be like this, and insight and wisdom can illuminate and see it.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b20_16']	此是名依佛菩薩正善知識、依根本智發心。	此是名依佛菩薩正善知識、依根本智發心。	This is called relying on the true and virtuous spiritual friends of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and giving rise to the aspiration based on fundamental wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b23_7']	如下文纔發心菩薩能於十方示身成佛者，為初發心時，乘如來不思議一切智乘，得佛種智，生如來法界之家。	如下文纔發心菩薩能於十方示身成佛者，為初發心時，乘如來不思議一切智乘，得佛種智，生如來法界之家。	As stated in the following text, the bodhisattvas who have just given rise to the aspiration are able to manifest their bodies becoming buddhas in the ten directions. This is because when they first give rise to the aspiration, they ride the inconceivable vehicle of omniscience of the Tathāgata, attain the wisdom of the Buddha's lineage, and are born in the family of the Tathāgata's Dharma realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b24_11']	乘佛一分之智慧大慈悲勢分，即能如是示身成佛。	乘佛一分之智慧大慈悲勢分，即能如是示身成佛。	Riding on the Buddha's one part of wisdom and great compassion, one is able to manifest the body and attain Buddhahood like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b25_12']	如下頌云「菩薩於佛十力中，雖未證得亦無疑。	如下頌云「菩薩於佛十力中，雖未證得亦無疑。	As the verse below says, Although bodhisattvas have not yet realized the ten powers of the Buddha, they are still without doubt.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b26_9']	菩薩於一毛孔中，普現十方無量剎。	菩薩於一毛孔中，普現十方無量剎。	In a single pore of a bodhisattva, immeasurable lands of the ten directions are universally manifested.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b27_15']	」如是總明初發心菩薩之德，為得如來一分智慧，勢分如是。	」如是總明初發心菩薩之德，為得如來一分智慧，勢分如是。	In this way, it generally clarifies the virtues of the bodhisattvas who have just given rise to the resolve for enlightenment. In order to attain the Buddha's one part of wisdom, the power is like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b28_18']	如輪王大子，權統王政亦得自在，一分與父王相似。	如輪王大子，權統王政亦得自在，一分與父王相似。	It is like the crown prince of a wheel-turning king who, in charge of the royal government, also attains sovereignty, one part being similar to the king.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838b29_18']	如動地興供，明法威力，亦明大眾法悅心悅。	如動地興供，明法威力，亦明大眾法悅心悅。	Like the shaking of the earth and the offering of offerings, it clarifies the power of the Dharma and also clarifies the joy of the great assembly, the joy of the mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c01_14']	地動明心境體無二故，境由心現故。	地動明心境體無二故，境由心現故。	The shaking of the earth clarifies that the substance of the mind and the realm are non-dual, because the realm is manifested by the mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c03_11']	如十方各過萬佛剎微塵數佛，同名法慧來現其前者，為明與十方諸佛智慧合故。	如十方各過萬佛剎微塵數佛，同名法慧來現其前者，為明與十方諸佛智慧合故。	Like the Buddhas with the same name of Dharma Wisdom, each from beyond the dust-like lands of the ten directions, coming to appear before him, it is to clarify the merging with the wisdom of the Buddhas of the ten directions.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c04_10']	萬佛剎塵者，明昇進修行啟迷悟法之量。	萬佛剎塵者，明昇進修行啟迷悟法之量。	As many as the dust particles in ten thousand buddha-lands clarifies the measure of the Dharma of enlightenment and delusion in the practice of advancement.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c05_16']	十信十，十住百，十行千，總是明昇進見諦解迷悟法之名。	十信十，十住百，十行千，總是明昇進見諦解迷悟法之名。	The ten faiths are ten, the ten abodes are one hundred, and the ten practices are one thousand. This all clarifies the name of the Dharma of enlightenment and delusion in the insight and understanding of advancement.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c09_2']	如下萬佛剎微塵數菩薩發心，受過千不可說劫成佛之記，皆同號之為清淨心者，亦明達如是千不可說劫量法門總清淨故，故佛號清淨心。	如下萬佛剎微塵數菩薩發心，受過千不可說劫成佛之記，皆同號之為清淨心者，亦明達如是千不可說劫量法門總清淨故，故佛號清淨心。	As it is said below, Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in ten thousand buddha-lands gave rise to the mind of enlightenment and received the prediction of buddhahood after an inexpressibly long eon of a thousand kalpas. They all had the same name of Pure Mind, this also clarifies the complete purity of the Dharma gates of an inexpressibly long eon of a thousand kalpas. Therefore, the Buddha's name is Pure Mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c09_16']	非是實有如情所見長遠之劫也。	非是實有如情所見長遠之劫也。	It is not truly existent as seen by sentient beings as a long eon.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c11_5']	總明當位隨迷悟法之名，不是存其劫量之說，如妄情所見也。	總明當位隨迷悟法之名，不是存其劫量之說，如妄情所見也。	It generally clarifies the name of the Dharma of enlightenment and delusion in the present stage, not retaining the teaching of the measure of the eon as seen by deluded thoughts.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c12_4']	自此已下直至品末，如文自具如文稱歎。	自此已下直至品末，如文自具如文稱歎。	From here onward until the end of the chapter, the text is self-contained as it praises the text.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c13_16']	如是已下二百四十二行頌、一百六十八行，總歎佛果及信等六位法門。	如是已下二百四十二行頌、一百六十八行，總歎佛果及信等六位法門。	From here on, there are 242 lines of verse and 168 lines in total praising the Buddha's fruition and the Dharma gates of the six stages such as faith.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c15_12']	已下七十四行所歎，此品之內挍量發心功德廣大難比，如文具明，隨文稱歎。	已下七十四行所歎，此品之內挍量發心功德廣大難比，如文具明，隨文稱歎。	The praise below for 74 lines is the comparison of the vast and difficult to compare merits of giving rise to the mind in this chapter, as fully explained in the text, praising according to the text.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c16_1']	四行一頌，准例知之。	四行一頌，准例知之。	Four lines per verse, understand by analogy.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c20_19']	如是挍量初發心功德，設使以等虛空無限境界，以一切樂具總供養無限眾生，皆令得人天勝樂，又教令得四沙門果及辟支佛及三乘出世菩提，如是虛空境界及所度眾生雖等，然未令所化眾生得成佛，亦不可比。	如是挍量初發心功德，設使以等虛空無限境界，以一切樂具總供養無限眾生，皆令得人天勝樂，又教令得四沙門果及辟支佛及三乘出世菩提，如是虛空境界及所度眾生雖等，然未令所化眾生得成佛，亦不可比。	Thus comparing the merits of first giving rise to the mind, even if using the infinite realm of space, offering all kinds of pleasures to infinite sentient beings, causing them to attain the supreme bliss of humans and gods, and also teaching them to attain the four fruits of the śramaṇa, the pratyekabuddha, and the three vehicles' supramundane enlightenment, although the realm of space and the sentient beings to be saved are equal in this way, still it does not cause the sentient beings to be transformed to attain Buddhahood, and is also incomparable.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c22_12']	於此教中，初發心乘如來大智，等佛所行普化眾生皆成佛故，發菩提心。	於此教中，初發心乘如來大智，等佛所行普化眾生皆成佛故，發菩提心。	In this teaching, those who first generate the mind of enlightenment ride the Tathāgata's great wisdom, equally practicing as the buddhas do, universally transforming sentient beings to all attain buddhahood, and thus generate the mind of enlightenment.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c24_7']	以是義故，所舉境界廣狹不等，所化眾生成佛不成佛不等故，不可為比故。	以是義故，所舉境界廣狹不等，所化眾生成佛不成佛不等故，不可為比故。	For this reason, the scope of the realms mentioned is not the same, and whether the sentient beings transformed attain buddhahood or not is not the same, so they cannot be compared.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c27_6']	是故此品下文云「初發心菩薩不於三世少有所得，所謂若諸佛、若諸佛法，若菩薩、若菩薩法，若獨覺、若獨覺法，若聲聞、若聲聞法。	是故此品下文云「初發心菩薩不於三世少有所得，所謂若諸佛、若諸佛法，若菩薩、若菩薩法，若獨覺、若獨覺法，若聲聞、若聲聞法。	Therefore, the text below in this chapter says, The bodhisattvas who first generate the mind of enlightenment do not obtain anything in the three times, namely, the buddhas, the buddhas' teachings, the bodhisattvas, the bodhisattvas' teachings, the pratyekabuddhas, the pratyekabuddhas' teachings, the śrāvakas, or the śrāvakas' teachings.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c28_14']	」乃至廣說如經，但為唯求一切智，於諸法界心無所著發菩提心。	」乃至廣說如經，但為唯求一切智，於諸法界心無所著發菩提心。	And so on, as extensively explained in the sūtra, but only seeking omniscience, with no attachment to the dharma realm, they generate the mind of enlightenment.
['ZH_T36_1739_018:0838c29_4']	略說菩提，其法有四：	略說菩提，其法有四：	In brief, there are four aspects to enlightenment:
