['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419a25_4']	後經亦應得作是釋：	後經亦應得作是釋：	015	The latter scripture should also be interpreted as follows:
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419a26_10']	此生故彼生者，此說有因相續為先，然後有果相續而住。	此生故彼生者，此說有因相續為先，然後有果相續而住。	015	The arising of this exists because that arising exists means that the continuity of causes exists first, and then the continuity of effects exists.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419a27_10']	非彼宗有與生義別，如非將生時與將起時異。	非彼宗有與生義別，如非將生時與將起時異。	015	In that school, there is no difference between the meaning of arising and the meaning of existence, just as there is no difference between the time of about to arise and the time of about to occur.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419a27_15']	又所疑問：	又所疑問：	015	Moreover, the question raised:
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419a28_1']	誰生為先？	誰生為先？	015	Who arises first?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419a28_6']	誰住已住？	誰住已住？	015	Who abides after having abided?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419a29_10']	亦不應理，前後二門不相待故，二門所待義各異故。	亦不應理，前後二門不相待故，二門所待義各異故。	015	This also is unreasonable, because the two gates do not depend on each other, and because the meanings of the two gates that are depended on are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b03_8']	非前所說依此有彼有，復待後說此生故彼生，謂前已說依此有彼有，不待疑問誰生故彼生，并待後釋因生故果生，前義方了。	非前所說依此有彼有，復待後說此生故彼生，謂前已說依此有彼有，不待疑問誰生故彼生，并待後釋因生故果生，前義方了。	015	It is not the case that what was previously explained as this existing, that exists again depends on the later explanation of this arising, that arises, meaning that what was previously explained as this existing, that exists does not depend on the question of who arises, that arises, and only becomes understood when combined with the later explanation of causes arising, effects arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b05_6']	如後所說此生故彼生，要待疑問誰生故彼生，復待別釋因生故果生，義即明了；	如後所說此生故彼生，要待疑問誰生故彼生，復待別釋因生故果生，義即明了；	015	Just as what is later explained as this arising, that arises must depend on the question of who arises, that arises, and only becomes clearly understood when combined with the separate explanation of causes arising, effects arise,
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b07_2']	如是前說依此有彼有，亦待疑問依誰有彼有，復待別釋依因有果有，義即明了。	如是前說依此有彼有，亦待疑問依誰有彼有，復待別釋依因有果有，義即明了。	015	Thus, the former statement, “When this exists, that exists,” also requires a question, “Dependent on what does that exist?” It also requires a separate explanation, “Dependent on causes, that exists.” The meaning is then clear.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b08_19']	是故前後所待各別，故我所說初經為顯俱生因義、後經復顯前生因義，其理極成。	是故前後所待各別，故我所說初經為顯俱生因義、後經復顯前生因義，其理極成。	015	Therefore, the two statements are different. Thus, the first sūtra passage I cited is to show the meaning of the cause of simultaneous arising, and the second sūtra passage shows the meaning of the cause of prior arising. The reasoning is completely established.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b09_8']	彼復異門釋此經義：	彼復異門釋此經義：	015	They also explain the meaning of this sūtra passage in another way:
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b10_7']	前經為顯諸行有因，後經為遮計常因執。	前經為顯諸行有因，後經為遮計常因執。	015	The former sūtra passage is to show that conditioned forces have causes, and the latter sūtra passage is to refute the view that the cause is eternal.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b11_6']	此亦非理，但說後經如是二門皆成就故。	此亦非理，但說後經如是二門皆成就故。	015	This is also unreasonable, because it is only said that the latter sūtra passage accomplishes these two aspects.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b12_2']	謂經但說此生故彼生，二事俱辯。	謂經但說此生故彼生，二事俱辯。	015	That is to say, the sūtra only says, “Because this arises, that arises,” and both aspects are discussed.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b14_8']	由說因果相繼而生，顯行有因遮無因論，由生言故顯無常因，亦即能遮說常因論，諸常住法必無生故。	由說因果相繼而生，顯行有因遮無因論，由生言故顯無常因，亦即能遮說常因論，諸常住法必無生故。	015	Because it is said that cause and effect succeed one another in arising, it shows that conditioned forces have causes and refutes the theory of causelessness. Because of the word “arising,” it shows that the cause is impermanent and also can refute the theory that the cause is eternal, because the dharmas of permanence and abiding definitely do not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b15_7']	既由後說二事俱成，則說前經便為無用。	既由後說二事俱成，則說前經便為無用。	015	Since both things are established by the later statement, the earlier sūtra statement is useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b16_6']	非薄伽梵說無用經，故知二經非如彼釋。	非薄伽梵說無用經，故知二經非如彼釋。	015	The Bhagavān does not speak sūtras that are useless, therefore we know that the two sūtras are not as explained by you.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b18_4']	設許如是解釋前經，亦不乖違俱生因義，謂即依此俱生因有而能令彼俱生果有。	設許如是解釋前經，亦不乖違俱生因義，謂即依此俱生因有而能令彼俱生果有。	015	Even if we allow this explanation of the earlier sūtra, it does not contradict the meaning of the co-arising cause, which means that the co-arising effect exists because of the existence of this co-arising cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b19_3']	豈不由此顯行有因，亦即能遮執無因論？	豈不由此顯行有因，亦即能遮執無因論？	015	How is it not shown by this that conditioned forces have a cause, and that it also refutes the theory of causelessness?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b21_2']	如後所說此生故彼生，由此能顯因是無常，亦即能遮說常因論，而不違害說前生因。	如後所說此生故彼生，由此能顯因是無常，亦即能遮說常因論，而不違害說前生因。	015	As will be explained later, “because this arises, that arises,” by this it is shown that the cause is impermanent, and it also refutes the theory of a permanent cause, without contradicting the explanation of the previously arising cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b23_1']	如是前說依此有彼有，由此能顯諸行有因，亦即能遮說無因論，而不違害說俱生因。	如是前說依此有彼有，由此能顯諸行有因，亦即能遮說無因論，而不違害說俱生因。	015	In the same way, the earlier explanation “because this exists, that exists” shows that conditioned forces have a cause, and it also refutes the theory of causelessness, without contradicting the explanation of the co-arising cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b23_20']	又前生因正居有位，未來無故，都無所生。	又前生因正居有位，未來無故，都無所生。	015	Moreover, the previously arising cause is actually present, and because the future does not exist, it does not produce anything at all.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b25_7']	彼宗自說未來無故，既無所生，如何善逝分明顯說此有彼有？	彼宗自說未來無故，既無所生，如何善逝分明顯說此有彼有？	015	They themselves say that the future does not exist. Since there is nothing that is produced, how can the Well-Gone One clearly state that this exists and that exists?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b25_12']	如此有言：	如此有言：	015	As the saying goes:

['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b26_17']	故彼有言，亦差別說；	故彼有言，亦差別說；	015	Therefore, the word that is also a distinction;
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b27_15']	所說有義，亦應現有，此彼異因不可得故。	所說有義，亦應現有，此彼異因不可得故。	015	The meaning of existence that is stated should also exist in the present, because the different causes cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b28_15']	如是同喻，彼此極成，如言彼色居正滅位。	如是同喻，彼此極成，如言彼色居正滅位。	015	In this way, the common example is well-established by both parties, just as it is said that form exists in the state of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419b29_13']	又曾無處於極成無作差別說，言彼是有；	又曾無處於極成無作差別說，言彼是有；	015	Moreover, there is no place where it is said that what is well-established as nonexistent is distinguished and said to exist;
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c02_2']	如何可於未來無法作差別說言彼是有，於差別說而說為無？	如何可於未來無法作差別說言彼是有，於差別說而說為無？	015	How can it be said that what is nonexistent in the future is distinguished and said to exist? In the distinction, it is said to be nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c02_12']	如是所言，違害正理。	如是所言，違害正理。	015	Such statements contradict correct reasoning.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c03_10']	又未來法許有因故，雖無作用而體應有。	又未來法許有因故，雖無作用而體應有。	015	Moreover, future dharmas are allowed to have causes, so although they lack function, their substance should exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c04_8']	若彼不許未來有因，應許畢竟無同兔角。	若彼不許未來有因，應許畢竟無同兔角。	015	If they do not allow that the future has causes, they should allow that it is ultimately nonexistent, like the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c05_7']	既許有因，亦必應許未來體有異畢竟無。	既許有因，亦必應許未來體有異畢竟無。	015	Since you admit that there is a cause, you must also admit that the future has a nature that is different from absolute nonexistence.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c05_17']	諸所言無，義有多種：	諸所言無，義有多種：	015	There are many meanings to the word nonexistence.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c06_8']	未生、已滅、畢竟、互無。	未生、已滅、畢竟、互無。	015	Nonexistence can refer to that which has not yet arisen, that which has already perished, absolute nonexistence, and mutual nonexistence.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c08_13']	初二言無，但無作用，故未來世非體全無，得有能生及所生義，於正生位作用雖無，而有功能生所生法。	初二言無，但無作用，故未來世非體全無，得有能生及所生義，於正生位作用雖無，而有功能生所生法。	015	The first two kinds of nonexistence refer to the absence of activity. Therefore, the future is not completely nonexistent. It can have the meaning of that which produces and that which is produced. Even though activity does not exist in the present state of arising, there is a potentiality that produces the dharma that is produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c10_2']	又我不許諸未生因及已生因是真作者，諸法無有真作用故。	又我不許諸未生因及已生因是真作者，諸法無有真作用故。	015	Moreover, we do not admit that causes that have not yet arisen or that have already arisen are true agents, because dharmas have no true activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c11_1']	真作用者，謂諸因緣，於所生果常能造作。	真作用者，謂諸因緣，於所生果常能造作。	015	True activity refers to the fact that causes and conditions are always able to produce the results that are produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c11_10']	此真作用非佛所許。	此真作用非佛所許。	015	The Buddha does not admit this true activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c13_1']	然諸法生互相繫屬，隨有所闕，餘則不生，非此不生彼有生義。	然諸法生互相繫屬，隨有所闕，餘則不生，非此不生彼有生義。	015	However, the arising of dharmas is mutually related. If any one is lacking, the others do not arise. It is not the case that if this does not arise, that has the meaning of arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c14_10']	依如是量說此為因，此因功能非恒時有，故無諸法恒時生過。	依如是量說此為因，此因功能非恒時有，故無諸法恒時生過。	015	Based on this amount, we say that this is the cause. The function of this cause does not always exist, so there is no error of all dharmas being produced at all times.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c15_17']	又我不許唯俱生因不假餘因能生諸法，故無諸法恒時生過。	又我不許唯俱生因不假餘因能生諸法，故無諸法恒時生過。	015	Moreover, I do not allow that only the co-arisen cause, without needing other causes, can produce all dharmas, so there is no error of all dharmas being produced at all times.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c16_16']	又唯說有前生因者，於如是過豈獨言無？	又唯說有前生因者，於如是過豈獨言無？	015	Moreover, as for those who only speak of the previously arisen cause, how can they alone be said to be free from this error?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c17_15']	彼前生因恒時有故，應一切法一切時生。	彼前生因恒時有故，應一切法一切時生。	015	Because the previously arisen cause always exists, all dharmas should be produced at all times.

How can your school alone be harmed by the error of all dharmas being produced at all times?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c23_5']	若汝雖執唯前生因而待餘緣方能生果，何故不許此俱生因亦待餘緣方能生法，如汝所執唯前生因能生諸法？	若汝雖執唯前生因而待餘緣方能生果，何故不許此俱生因亦待餘緣方能生法，如汝所執唯前生因能生諸法？	015	If you grasp that only the previously arisen cause can produce results, but it must await other conditions before it can produce, why do you not allow that this co-arisen cause also must await other conditions before it can produce dharmas, just as you grasp that only the previously arisen cause can produce all dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c23_20']	然不恒生，未來亦爾，不應為難。	然不恒生，未來亦爾，不應為難。	015	But they are not always produced, and the same is true of future dharmas. You should not raise any objections.

All of these are unreasonable. We see that when one of the two horns is broken, the other is not broken.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c26_16']	若隨一壞餘亦壞者，可比相生，如心心所。	若隨一壞餘亦壞者，可比相生，如心心所。	015	If when one is broken the other is also broken, then they can be inferred to be produced from each other, like mind and mental activities.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c27_18']	又我不許一切俱生皆有展轉為因果義，許有者何？	又我不許一切俱生皆有展轉為因果義，許有者何？	015	Moreover, we do not admit that all dharmas that are produced together have the meaning of being causes and effects of each other. What do we admit?
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0419c29_3']	謂共一果或展轉果方有此義，或由此力彼法得生。	謂共一果或展轉果方有此義，或由此力彼法得生。	015	We admit that they have this meaning when they have the same effect or when they are effects of each other, or when a dharma is produced by the power of this.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0420a01_11']	如是俱生有因果義，非牛兩角有上所說，故不可引為同法喻。	如是俱生有因果義，非牛兩角有上所說，故不可引為同法喻。	015	In this way, dharmas that are produced together have the meaning of being causes and effects, but this is not the case with the two horns of an ox, as was said above. Therefore, you cannot cite them as an example.

['ZH_T29_1562_015:0420a07_4']	如是說有俱生因者，亦許少分俱生非因，非諸俱生皆無因義。	如是說有俱生因者，亦許少分俱生非因，非諸俱生皆無因義。	015	In the same way, it is said that there is a simultaneous cause, and it is also allowed that there is a small part that is simultaneous and not a cause, but it is not the case that all that is simultaneous is without the meaning of cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_015:0420a09_2']	又有別喻證俱生因，故彼立因有不定過，謂世現見燈之與明俱時而生，有因果故。	又有別喻證俱生因，故彼立因有不定過，謂世現見燈之與明俱時而生，有因果故。	015	There is also a separate analogy that proves the simultaneous cause, and therefore the reason they establish has the fault of being inconclusive, because it is seen in the world that a lamp and its light arise simultaneously, because there is a cause and effect.

Therefore you should not cite this as an example.
