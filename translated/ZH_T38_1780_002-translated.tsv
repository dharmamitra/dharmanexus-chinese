The vast and great is the common name of various sūtras. All Mahāyāna sūtras say it is vast and great, also called vast and great. It is said in the Great Vast and Great Assembly Sūtra, and the Nirvāṇa Sūtra also says the vast and great is the nectar, which is called Vaipulya among the twelve divisions, so the name vast and great is the common name.

['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b15_4']	《釋論》云「前三地慧多定小，後三地定多慧少，故定慧不等。	《釋論》云「前三地慧多定小，後三地定多慧少，故定慧不等。	002	The Treatise says, In the first three grounds, wisdom is greater and concentration is lesser; in the latter three grounds, concentration is greater and wisdom is lesser, so concentration and wisdom are not equal.
['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b15_16']	今定慧平等，故云等定慧。	今定慧平等，故云等定慧。	002	Now concentration and wisdom are equal, so it is called equal concentration and wisdom.

In the sixth ground, the still discernment of prajñā is concentration, and the moving illumination through skillful means is wisdom.
['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b18_4']	六地妙於靜鑒、拙於動涉，故定慧未等。	六地妙於靜鑒、拙於動涉，故定慧未等。	002	In the sixth ground, one is skillful in still discernment but clumsy in moving engagement, so concentration and wisdom are not yet equal.

['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b19_19']	定慧既等，何故名無生耶？	定慧既等，何故名無生耶？	002	Since concentration and wisdom are already equal, why is it called birthlessness?
['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b20_1']	答：	答：	002	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b21_4', 'ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b21_14']	《釋論》云「七地具了眾生及法皆悉無生，名無生忍」。🔽不偏著有，有心不生；	《釋論》云「七地具了眾生及法皆悉無生，名無生忍」。 不偏著有，有心不生；	002	The Treatise says, The seventh ground fully understands that both sentient beings and dharmas are all birthless, called the acceptance of non-arising.🔽Not biased towards existence, the mind of existence does not arise;
['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b22_3']	不偏滯於空，空心不起。	不偏滯於空，空心不起。	002	Not stuck in emptiness, the mind of emptiness does not arise.
['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b23_8']	故慧常方便、方便常慧，空有雙遊，無所偏著，故云無生。	故慧常方便、方便常慧，空有雙遊，無所偏著，故云無生。	002	Therefore, wisdom is always accompanied by skillful means, and skillful means is always accompanied by wisdom. Emptiness and existence travel together, without attachment to either side. Therefore, it is called non-arising.
['ZH_T38_1780_002:0866b24_9']	三者七地雖得無生已能並觀，但猶有功用心。	三者七地雖得無生已能並觀，但猶有功用心。	002	Third, although the seventh ground has attained non-arising and is able to contemplate both emptiness and existence, there is still the use of effort.
