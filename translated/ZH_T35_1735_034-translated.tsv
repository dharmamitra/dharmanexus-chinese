['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769a22_1']	雖不足全別十地，為是化生之法，故用之耳。	雖不足全別十地，為是化生之法，故用之耳。	Although they are not completely separate from the ten stages, they are the Dharma of transforming beings, therefore, they are used.

['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769a24_17']	若不爾者，何不二地言二度增？	若不爾者，何不二地言二度增？	If it were not so, why not say that the second ground has two perfections increasing?
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769a25_7']	檀度初地先已增故。	檀度初地先已增故。	Because the perfection of generosity in the first ground has already increased.

First, it cites the offering to the Buddha and transformation of life as the refiner, and the pure dharmas such as faith as the refined. Later, it raises the previous dedication as the refiner to make the faith and so forth pure.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b08_3']	言轉轉者，此之信等於初地中有三節，淨謂初住地時證前緣修令成真修，已是一淨；	言轉轉者，此之信等於初地中有三節，淨謂初住地時證前緣修令成真修，已是一淨；	As for turning and turning, this faith and so forth have three sections in the first ground. Purity refers to when one first abides in the ground, realizing the conditioned cultivation of the previous to make it true cultivation, which is already one purity;
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b08_18']	二行校量中對除障法，復一度淨；	二行校量中對除障法，復一度淨；	In the second, comparing and measuring the practices, it again purifies by removing the dharma of obstacles;
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b09_13']	今此地後更歷三修，故云轉轉。	今此地後更歷三修，故云轉轉。	Now, after this ground, one further goes through the three cultivations, thus it says turning and turning.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b10_17']	第二喻中，金師喻菩薩，金喻信等，火喻供等三行。	第二喻中，金師喻菩薩，金喻信等，火喻供等三行。	In the second analogy, the goldsmith is analogous to the bodhisattva, the gold is analogous to faith and so forth, and the fire is analogous to the three practices such as offering.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b11_16']	三行非一名數數入，調柔成就喻鍊行成。	三行非一名數數入，調柔成就喻鍊行成。	The three practices are not one, thus it is called entering again and again. The accomplishment of pliancy is analogous to the accomplishment of refined practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b12_16']	金性本有從緣始顯，信等修生云何同喻？	金性本有從緣始顯，信等修生云何同喻？	The nature of gold originally exists, but is only revealed from conditions. How can faith and so forth that are cultivated and born be the same as the analogy?
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b13_2']	信等有二：	信等有二：	Faith and so forth have two aspects:
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b14_4']	一未證真前但約緣修為對治行，妄識為體。	一未證真前但約緣修為對治行，妄識為體。	First, before realizing the truth, it is only about expedient practice as the practice of counteracting, with false consciousness as its essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b17_5']	二證真之後乃知信等非是今有，即如來藏中恒沙佛法真心為體，真心為體即是理性，信等相殊說為行性，此二不二並可喻金。	二證真之後乃知信等非是今有，即如來藏中恒沙佛法真心為體，真心為體即是理性，信等相殊說為行性，此二不二並可喻金。	Second, after realizing the truth, one knows that faith and so forth are not newly arisen, but are the essence of the true mind of the Tathāgatagarbha's innumerable Buddha-dharmas. The essence of the true mind is precisely the principle of nature, and the distinct characteristics of faith and so forth are called the nature of practice. These two are non-dual and can both be compared to gold.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b18_3']	雖假供等緣修以成真德，德由真起。	雖假供等緣修以成真德，德由真起。	Although it relies on the expedient cultivation of offerings and so forth to accomplish true virtue, virtue arises from the truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b18_13']	後成嚴具，亦不異金。	後成嚴具，亦不異金。	Later, when it becomes an ornament, it is also not different from gold.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b20_3']	既了於真，真非妄外，故全妄識即是真心，寄相顯真故分能所。	既了於真，真非妄外，故全妄識即是真心，寄相顯真故分能所。	Since one understands the truth, and the truth is not outside of delusion, the entire deluded consciousness is precisely the true mind. It relies on characteristics to manifest the truth, so it distinguishes between subject and object.
['ZH_T35_1735_034:0769b20_13']	第三法合，準喻可知。	第三法合，準喻可知。	The third is the application to the Dharma, which can be understood according to the analogy.
