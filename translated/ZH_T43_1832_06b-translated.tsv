The answer is: The Pratītyasamutpāda Sūtra says: The four kinds of transformations of ignorance induced by improper attention of ordinary beings in the external dharma
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780a23_3']	既由非理作意引生四種無明。	既由非理作意引生四種無明。	Since the four kinds of ignorance are produced by improper attention,

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780a27_12']	若不放逸起非福業雖無明發。	若不放逸起非福業雖無明發。	If one is not heedful and gives rise to inauspicious karma, although it is produced by ignorance,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780a28_4']	不能為緣招三惡趣。	不能為緣招三惡趣。	it is unable to serve as a condition to summon the three evil destinies.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780a29_14']	故非無明支　內法異生若諸放逸及不放逸起福．不動所有無明。	故非無明支　內法異生若諸放逸及不放逸起福．不動所有無明。	Therefore it is not a part of the link of ignorance. Internally-stimulated ordinary beings, whether heedful or heedless, give rise to meritorious and unmoving karma, and the ignorance that is possessed.

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b03_4']	於生於死起定信故。	於生於死起定信故。	Because one gives rise to definite faith in birth and death.

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b06_6']	是於生死起定信故　又復求生知足淨土。	是於生死起定信故　又復求生知足淨土。	Because one generates firm faith in samsara.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b06_15']	亦是生死由定信故。	亦是生死由定信故。	Moreover, seeking rebirth in the Pure Land of contentment is also due to firm faith in samsara.🔽It subsumes that ignorance which is the nature of being obscured.

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b08_10']	通有覆．不善無明所發。	通有覆．不善無明所發。	they are produced by both obscured and unwholesome ignorance.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b09_1']	以放逸者當感惡趣。	以放逸者當感惡趣。	Because those who are negligent will experience evil destinies.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b10_3']	經唯說彼不放逸之者造非福行不感惡趣故。	經唯說彼不放逸之者造非福行不感惡趣故。	The sutra only says that those who are not negligent and create non-meritorious actions do not experience evil destinies.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b10_16']	如何不起不善無明發於福行。	如何不起不善無明發於福行。	How is it that unwholesome ignorance does not produce meritorious actions?
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b11_16']	即諸但求人．天福樂放逸之者起不善發。	即諸但求人．天福樂放逸之者起不善發。	That is, those who are negligent and only seek the blessings and happiness of humans and gods produce them through unwholesome ignorance.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b12_11']	若求知足希見佛等即有覆發。	若求知足希見佛等即有覆發。	If one seeks contentment and aspires to see the Buddha, etc., they are produced by the obscured.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b12_16']	此釋為勝。	此釋為勝。	This explanation is superior.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b13_13']	若不放逸發福．不動又有二說。	若不放逸發福．不動又有二說。	If one is not negligent and produces meritorious and immovable [actions], there are two explanations.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b13_18']	一云隨眠。	一云隨眠。	One says that it is the latent tendencies.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b14_5']	非現行發故。	非現行發故。	Because they are not produced by manifest [ignorance].
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b14_12']	雜集論第七云。	雜集論第七云。	The seventh chapter of the Abhidharmasamuccaya says:
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b15_3']	未見諦者雖起善心。	未見諦者雖起善心。	Those who have not yet seen the truth, although they give rise to wholesome thoughts,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b15_16']	由彼隨眠所隨逐故亦名愚癡。	由彼隨眠所隨逐故亦名愚癡。	Because they are pursued by these latent afflictions, they are also called fools.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b16_12']	由彼勢力於三界苦不如實知。	由彼勢力於三界苦不如實知。	Due to the power of these [afflictions], one does not truly understand the suffering of the three realms.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b17_3']	便發福．不動業。	便發福．不動業。	One then gives rise to meritorious and immovable karma.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b17_10']	緣起經下卷云。	緣起經下卷云。	The lower fascicle of the Pratītyasamutpāda Sūtra says:
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b18_1']	又不放逸內法果生。	又不放逸內法果生。	Moreover, the internal fruits of non-negligence arise.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b18_10']	若造福行及不動行。	若造福行及不動行。	If one creates meritorious or immovable karma,

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b20_5']	解脫為依迴向解脫而引發故。	解脫為依迴向解脫而引發故。	Because it is drawn forth in dependence on liberation and directed towards liberation,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b20_14']	雖於善趣感殊勝生。	雖於善趣感殊勝生。	although one experiences a superior rebirth in the good destinies,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b21_5']	而非無明起增上緣。	而非無明起增上緣。	it is not the dominant condition for the arising of ignorance.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b21_16']	既云相應善心之所引發。	既云相應善心之所引發。	Since it is said to be drawn forth by the wholesome mind,

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b25_5']	何故用下無明發上地行　答樞要釋．云。	何故用下無明發上地行　答樞要釋．云。	why does it use the lower ignorance to give rise to the karmic formations of the upper stages? Answer: The Pivot of Abhidharma explains:
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b25_15']	有下現行無明為因起。	有下現行無明為因起。	There is the ignorance of present activity that arises with inferior [realms] as its cause.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b26_7']	自迷真實義愚現見有故。	自迷真實義愚現見有故。	Because it is deluded about the true meaning and foolishly clings to what is presently seen.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0780b27_13']	此意由愚求上地生故下愚發一云唯除不共餘無明發。	此意由愚求上地生故下愚發一云唯除不共餘無明發。	This mind, due to being foolish and seeking rebirth in higher realms, gives rise to the inferior [realms]. One says it only gives rise to the other ignorance, excluding the unique [ignorance].

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a03_16']	由愚是彼境界果受之因故。	由愚是彼境界果受之因故。	it is because delusion is the cause of experience, which is the fruit of those objects.

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a05_14']	不言境界愚愛故前第四云。	不言境界愚愛故前第四云。	It does not say that objects, delusion, and craving are the same, so the fourth chapter says:

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a07_10']	一云由此第二境界所生受之迷增上果愚。	一云由此第二境界所生受之迷增上果愚。	The second says: 'Because of the delusion that arises from the second kind of objects, namely the dominant fruits of experience,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a08_1']	意云此境界所生受。	意云此境界所生受。	The meaning is that this experience that arises from objects,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a08_12']	是迷外增上果愚之所生。	是迷外增上果愚之所生。	This is born from the delusion regarding the dominant fruit of the external.

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a10_5']	即由第二境界所生受因境所生。	即由第二境界所生受因境所生。	so the feeling produced by the second object is produced by the object.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a10_14']	又取受字云受果愚。	又取受字云受果愚。	Also, taking the word feeling as feeling the fruit of delusion,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a11_6']	即因愚起舉果顯因。	即因愚起舉果顯因。	it is because delusion arises from the cause, and the fruit is manifested by the cause.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a11_17']	云第二境界所生受果愚。	云第二境界所生受果愚。	It is said that the feeling produced by the second object is the delusion of the fruit of feeling.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a12_16']	正說應云迷外增上果境界愚為緣起受。	正說應云迷外增上果境界愚為緣起受。	The correct explanation should say that feeling arises with the delusion regarding the dominant fruit of the external as its condition,
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a13_10']	受彼外果方起愛．取故。	受彼外果方起愛．取故。	because one gives rise to craving and grasping only after experiencing the external fruit.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a14_1']	前云受二種先業果。	前云受二種先業果。	Previously it was said that feeling is of two kinds, the fruit of past karma,

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a14_18']	及境界所生受增上果。	及境界所生受增上果。	and feeling produced by the object, the dominant fruit.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a15_3']	此意云。	此意云。	This means,

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a15_15']	受外增上果。	受外增上果。	experiences the dominant fruit of the external.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a16_5']	不得說境是受之果。	不得說境是受之果。	One cannot say that the object is the fruit of feeling.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a16_15']	論云受二種先業果故。	論云受二種先業果故。	The treatise says that feeling is of two kinds, the fruit of past karma.

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a18_6']	緣境界受發生貪愛。	緣境界受發生貪愛。	Feeling that takes external objects as its object gives rise to craving.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a18_16']	此即直明　西明二解。	此即直明　西明二解。	This directly clarifies. The Ximing Monastery has two explanations.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a19_4']	一云迷受生愚。	一云迷受生愚。	One says that delusion arises from feeling.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a19_15']	此受是外境界增上果故。	此受是外境界增上果故。	This feeling is the dominant fruit of external objects.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a20_6']	此論即云外增上果愚。	此論即云外增上果愚。	This treatise then says it is delusion regarding the dominant fruit of external objects.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a20_11']	故不相違。	故不相違。	Therefore, there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a21_2']	一云迷境界生愚故。	一云迷境界生愚故。	One says that delusion arises from being deluded about objects.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a21_12']	此論云迷外增上果愚。	此論云迷外增上果愚。	This treatise says it is delusion regarding the dominant fruit of external objects.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a22_3']	然境界是受增上果。	然境界是受增上果。	However, objects are the dominant fruit of feeling.
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a23_2']	故瑜伽即云境界所生受果愚　要集云。	故瑜伽即云境界所生受果愚　要集云。	Therefore, the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says it is delusion regarding the fruit of feeling that arises from objects. The Yaoshanji says:
['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0782a23_12']	後解為勝　今謂俱非。	後解為勝　今謂俱非。	The latter explanation is superior. Now, I say that both are not correct.

['ZH_T43_1832_06b:0786c04_5']	以立唯識故。	以立唯識故。	Because it establishes only consciousness.
