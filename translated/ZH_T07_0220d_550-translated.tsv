The initial arising of the mind cannot realize supreme perfect enlightenment, nor can it be apart from the initial arising of the mind. The subsequent arising of the mind cannot realize supreme perfect enlightenment, nor can it be apart from the subsequent arising of the mind. However, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas practicing the skillful means of the profound perfection of wisdom cause their wholesome roots to increase and be fulfilled, and are able to realize supreme perfect enlightenment.
