['ZH_T11_0310_006:0031b23_11']	於一切法自性如實不分別時，一切諸法悉入其中，離於無作及有作故。	於一切法自性如實不分別時，一切諸法悉入其中，離於無作及有作故。	When the intrinsic nature of all dharmas is truly not discriminated, all dharmas are included within it, because they are apart from non-action and action.

['ZH_T11_0310_006:0031c17_18']	由彼彼門得說法名，若說文字，若說語業，彼一切門亦不可得，門清淨故、無所有故。	由彼彼門得說法名，若說文字，若說語業，彼一切門亦不可得，門清淨故、無所有故。	Because of those various gates, the name of the Dharma is expounded. Whether expounding written language or expounding verbal actions, all those gates are also unobtainable, because the gates are pure and nonexistent.
