['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c10_6']	實無涅槃生涅槃想，說化城治。	實無涅槃生涅槃想，說化城治。	The countermeasure of the transformed city is taught for those who actually have no nirvāṇa but give rise to the notion of nirvāṇa.

['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c14_13']	若但依此七各有對治，則為法作譬說譬領解，佛以譬述等理似不成。	若但依此七各有對治，則為法作譬說譬領解，佛以譬述等理似不成。	If one only relies on these seven, each with its own countermeasure, then the Dharma becomes a parable, the parable becomes an understanding, and the principle of the Buddha's narration with parables seems to be incomplete.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c17_3']	應知論意，火宅則不指大車邊窮子，正用領付之意，雲雨令開權二乘故，化城以寶所引之，餘則可知。	應知論意，火宅則不指大車邊窮子，正用領付之意，雲雨令開權二乘故，化城以寶所引之，餘則可知。	One should know that the meaning of the treatise is that the burning house does not refer to the great vehicle on the side of the poor son, but uses the meaning of receiving and entrusting, and the clouds and rain cause the two vehicles to open up the provisional, therefore the city of the treasure attracts them, the rest can be known.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c19_4']	他若云今品唯出生者，全達經旨，況復論文從於能潤以雨為名，經從所潤故云藥草。	他若云今品唯出生者，全達經旨，況復論文從於能潤以雨為名，經從所潤故云藥草。	If others say that this chapter only produces the born, they completely understand the meaning of the sutra, let alone the treatise text which takes the rain as its name based on what can moisten, and the sutra takes what is moistened as its basis, therefore it says medicinal herbs.

['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c21_2']	「草木有二，一不知同，二不知異。	「草木有二，一不知同，二不知異。	Herbs and trees have two kinds, one that does not know the same, and one that does not know the different.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c22_8']	」若有瑞草，即能知同以喻迦葉，此則但從迦葉所領可爾。	」若有瑞草，即能知同以喻迦葉，此則但從迦葉所領可爾。	If there are auspicious herbs, then they can know the same, using this to compare with Kāśyapa, this can only be so based on what Kāśyapa understands.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c23_6']	若從佛述，豈可餘之藥草悉云不知？	若從佛述，豈可餘之藥草悉云不知？	If it is from the Buddha's narration, how can it be said that the remaining medicinal herbs all do not know?
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c24_15']	又亦不知三草二木是瑞非瑞，是故須云今昔方顯瑞之是非。	又亦不知三草二木是瑞非瑞，是故須云今昔方顯瑞之是非。	Moreover, they also do not know that the three kinds of grass and two kinds of trees are auspicious or not auspicious, therefore it is necessary to say that only now and in the past can the auspiciousness or not be revealed.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c25_13']	今謂至此法華，何得更有非瑞之草？	今謂至此法華，何得更有非瑞之草？	Now, having reached this Lotus Sutra, how can there still be non-auspicious grasses?
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0287c28_10']	應云是諸草木雖元一地所生一味一澤，而不自知，忽蒙開顯莫非祥瑞，乃使彈指合掌通成妙因，生無生慧咸成種智。	應云是諸草木雖元一地所生一味一澤，而不自知，忽蒙開顯莫非祥瑞，乃使彈指合掌通成妙因，生無生慧咸成種智。	It should be said that although all grasses and trees are originally born from the same earth and nourished by the same moisture, they do not know it themselves. Suddenly receiving the revelation, none are not auspicious omens, causing even snapping fingers and joining palms to become the wondrous causes, and the wisdom of birthlessness and non-arising to all become the wisdom of the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a01_7']	然文中四悉且從迦葉領述邊說，於中先總徵起，次「土地」下別釋四悉以酬向徵。	然文中四悉且從迦葉領述邊說，於中先總徵起，次「土地」下別釋四悉以酬向徵。	However, the four aspects in the text are based on what Kāśyapa has understood and explained. First, he raises the question in general, and next, under land and soil, he specifically explains the four aspects to respond to the question.

['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a03_16']	譬中土地約今，草木兼昔，故云「通皆有用」，藥草在今，藥之草故，名為「藥草」。	譬中土地約今，草木兼昔，故云「通皆有用」，藥草在今，藥之草故，名為「藥草」。	In the analogy, land and soil refers to the present, while grasses and trees include the past, thus saying all have a use. The medicinal herbs are in the present, and because they are medicinal herbs, they are called medicinal herbs.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a05_3']	「所生」等者，若從如來所述義邊，無非是藥，故云「通皆有用」；	「所生」等者，若從如來所述義邊，無非是藥，故云「通皆有用」；	As for what is born, if it is from the meaning explained by the Tathāgata, there is nothing that is not medicine, thus saying all have a use;
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a06_11']	若從能領中草為名，則秖應云中草品耳，故云「藥草用彊」。	若從能領中草為名，則秖應云中草品耳，故云「藥草用彊」。	If it is named based on the medium herbs that it can receive, then it should only be called the medium herb class. Therefore, it says the use of the herbs is strong.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a08_2']	「有漏」下合，先合昔，次「無漏」下合今，於中先合，次引證，三「述其」下結意。	「有漏」下合，先合昔，次「無漏」下合今，於中先合，次引證，三「述其」下結意。	The combined explanation first combines the past, and then below without outflows it combines the present. Within this, it first combines, then cites evidence, and thirdly below explains its it concludes the meaning.

['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a10_8']	若從佛述，應云草木及以地雨，今品既是述成之文，如何但指聲聞中草云四大弟子等耶？	若從佛述，應云草木及以地雨，今品既是述成之文，如何但指聲聞中草云四大弟子等耶？	If it is based on the Buddha's explanation, it should say herbs, trees, earth, and rain. Now that this chapter is a text that explains and confirms, how can it only point to the medium herbs among the śrāvakas and say the four great disciples, etc.?
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a10_10']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a11_14']	實如所問，言通意別故云藥草，言別意通且指聲聞。	實如所問，言通意別故云藥草，言別意通且指聲聞。	It is truly as asked. The words are general but the meaning is specific, therefore it says herbs. The words are specific but the meaning is general, so it just points to the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a13_8']	佛意雖通述，其得解別在迦葉，述其不及及以復宗，若別若通皆成藥草；	佛意雖通述，其得解別在迦葉，述其不及及以復宗，若別若通皆成藥草；	Although the Buddha's meaning is general in explaining and confirming, the specific understanding is in Kāśyapa. Explaining what he did not understand and restoring the main point, whether specific or general, all become herbs.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a14_4']	地雨復是述其領實，故不別說。	地雨復是述其領實，故不別說。	The earth and rain are also explaining his understanding of the truth, therefore they are not explained separately.

The sutra says he told Mahakasyapa. Kasyapa was the head of the monks, so he was specifically told. Therefore, we know that although the four people were listed in the faith and understanding, Subhuti was the head, but the chant of self-declaration belonged to Kasyapa, so he was now specifically told.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a18_2']	又言「及諸大弟子」，信知得悟不專四人。	又言「及諸大弟子」，信知得悟不專四人。	Moreover, it says and the great disciples. We can be sure that the realization was not exclusive to the four people.
['ZH_T34_1719_07c:0288a20_15']	「述其」等者，悟必通該、領述從別，佛雙述善哉及迦葉領通名藥草，並與歡喜意同，及領兼述同名世界，故可從通。	「述其」等者，悟必通該、領述從別，佛雙述善哉及迦葉領通名藥草，並與歡喜意同，及領兼述同名世界，故可從通。	Explaining their... Realization must be comprehensive, but the explanation follows the specific. The Buddha's double explanation of good and Kasyapa's general understanding are both called medicinal herbs, which is the same as the joyful meaning. And the explanation also includes the general, which is called the world. Therefore, it can follow the general.

Innate nature and characteristics are like the earth, giving rise to the mind of the Great Vehicle is like planting seeds, giving rise to the mind of the Two Vehicles is like the sprouts and stems of grasses and trees, now entering the first stage is like the sprouts and stems of the fully enlightened vehicle.

In the past, when removing the four abodes of consciousness, it only nourished the five skandhas. It now shades with the cloud of impartial compassion and sprinkles with the Dharma rain of impartiality, causing the distant seeds to gain benefits without partiality, and causing the impermanent grass to become the medicine king of permanence.

In the middle, wandering in the flow or again generating the mind, one does not leave the seven dharmas, therefore the seven dharmas are horizontal, and opposed to the one true as vertical.

Since the two vehicles are separately listed here, the conditioned liberation of the Tripiṭaka is that of the bodhisattvas, and the name of the unimpeded liberation of the Shared is shared by the three vehicles.

When the assembly heard the explanation of the Tathāgata's two knowledges, they knew that the Dharma body of the Buddha constantly thinks of the great and small, but were afraid that the understanding of the teachings might not be entirely good, so the Buddha used the two teachings and two knowledges to explain that the teachings are the same without error.

Since Kāśyapa himself understood from beginning to end, and also experienced the provisional and real of the five periods, the meaning includes everything, and therefore he is also able to praise it as very rare.

The Tathāgata remotely perceived that Kāśyapa was able to teach and explore the two understandings, how could he not know the kindness of the first four aspirations, and even to the end, causing me to transform others? The rituals of the ten directions are also not beyond this, therefore, in this chapter, the prose and verse universally describe it, then the three grasses, two trees, one earth, and one rain all describe Kāśyapa's beginning and end.

In the separate teaching, one can turn the Dharma wheel on the first ground, which is the nonretrogression of thought. In the shared and discrete teachings, one only turns the Dharma wheel upon reaching the fruition. How can one be called such a bodhisattva? Therefore, one should know that this is in the separate teaching.
