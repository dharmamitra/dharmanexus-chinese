['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028b08_13']	三九雖殊同歸一體，一尚無一，豈有九三？	三九雖殊同歸一體，一尚無一，豈有九三？	003	Although the three and nine are different, they all return to the one essence. Since there is not even one, how can there be three or nine?
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028b09_2']	雖無九三，九三宛爾。	雖無九三，九三宛爾。	003	Although there are not three or nine, the three and nine are still apparent.

['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028b23_15']	」一相寂滅即中道雙遮也，種種皆知即中道雙照也，當知三智圓融名一切種智。	」一相寂滅即中道雙遮也，種種皆知即中道雙照也，當知三智圓融名一切種智。	003	The single characteristic of quiescence is the double negation of the middle way, and knowing the various [characteristics] is the double illumination of the middle way. One should know that the perfect fusion of the three knowledges is called omniscience.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028b25_10']	故下結云「三智一心中得，照中即一切種智、照真即一切智、照俗即道種智。	故下結云「三智一心中得，照中即一切種智、照真即一切智、照俗即道種智。	003	Therefore, the conclusion below says, The three knowledges are attained in a single thought. Illuminating the middle is omniscience, illuminating the true is the knowledge of all modes, and illuminating the conventional is the knowledge of paths.

['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c04_18']	攝一切法攝一切人者，十界實法假人俱在一念，即三德故。	攝一切法攝一切人者，十界實法假人俱在一念，即三德故。	003	As for embracing all dharmas and all people, the real dharmas of the ten realms and the provisional people are all in a single thought, because they are the three virtues.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c05_14']	悉皆入中者，我究竟入，諸子分入。	悉皆入中者，我究竟入，諸子分入。	003	All enter within it means that I have ultimately entered, while the disciples have partially entered.

['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c08_2']	世人解諦等者，下疏云「舊或以境為四諦、或以智為四諦」，謂凡夫無智但有於境。	世人解諦等者，下疏云「舊或以境為四諦、或以智為四諦」，謂凡夫無智但有於境。	003	As for worldly people understanding the truths, etc., the commentary below says, The old masters sometimes take the objects as the four truths, and sometimes take the wisdom as the four truths. This means that ordinary beings have no wisdom but only objects.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c10_19']	所以經云「有苦無諦」，或云「苦集滅道皆是對境說智」，智即是諦，境能發智令智無所有，智能照境了境本無，境智相成故言四諦。	所以經云「有苦無諦」，或云「苦集滅道皆是對境說智」，智即是諦，境能發智令智無所有，智能照境了境本無，境智相成故言四諦。	003	Therefore, the sūtra says, There is suffering but no truth, or it says, The truths of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path are all spoken from the perspective of the object giving rise to cognition. Cognition is precisely truth. The object can give rise to cognition, but cognition has nothing. Cognition can illuminate the object, but the object is originally non-existent. Object and cognition are mutually accomplished, therefore it is called the four truths.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c12_4']	下疏中闕約教釋諦義，應謂言教詮辨分明是審諦義。	下疏中闕約教釋諦義，應謂言教詮辨分明是審諦義。	003	The lower commentary lacks the explanation of the meaning of truth from the perspective of the teachings. It should be said that the teachings clearly explain the meaning of truth.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c12_19']	經云「心喜說真諦」，說即教也。	經云「心喜說真諦」，說即教也。	003	The sūtra says, The mind rejoices in speaking the true truth. Speaking is precisely the teachings.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c13_9']	各得一途，故云非無此義。	各得一途，故云非無此義。	003	Each obtains one aspect, therefore it is said that this meaning is not non-existent.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c14_4']	今用理釋諦者，此即用興皇義也。	今用理釋諦者，此即用興皇義也。	003	Now using principle to explain truth is precisely using the meaning of Xinghuang.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c16_7']	故下疏云「興皇云諦者，只是佛性涅槃非境非智、非漏非無漏、非因非果、非世出世，故名聖諦。	故下疏云「興皇云諦者，只是佛性涅槃非境非智、非漏非無漏、非因非果、非世出世，故名聖諦。	003	Therefore, the lower commentary says, Xinghuang says that truth is precisely buddha-nature and nirvāṇa, neither object nor cognition, neither contaminated nor uncontaminated, neither cause nor effect, neither worldly nor supramundane, therefore it is called the noble truth.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c16_15']	」此乃約理釋也。	」此乃約理釋也。	003	This is precisely the explanation from the perspective of principle.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c18_2']	然今約一理，隨機而有四種四諦之別，則興皇所釋未為盡善。	然今約一理，隨機而有四種四諦之別，則興皇所釋未為盡善。	003	However, now, in terms of one principle, there are four kinds of four truths according to the capacities of beings. Then the explanation by Xinghuang is not entirely correct.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c19_2']	理當即境正者，以境是事，事元依理，故境正。	理當即境正者，以境是事，事元依理，故境正。	003	As for the principle corresponds to the correct object, the object is a phenomenon, and the phenomenon originally relies on the principle, so the object is correct.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c20_1']	即智教俱正者，以依境發智，依智說教故。	即智教俱正者，以依境發智，依智說教故。	003	As for the wisdom and teaching are both correct, it is because the wisdom is aroused based on the object, and the teaching is expounded based on the wisdom.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c21_7']	「以理」下，理為境智教之本，舉本攝末，故以理釋諦義方允合。	「以理」下，理為境智教之本，舉本攝末，故以理釋諦義方允合。	003	As for the principle, the principle is the basis of the object, wisdom, and teaching. Taking the basis to include the branches, therefore, using the principle to explain the meaning of truth is truly in accord.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c22_2']	能生生所生者，習因招苦果也。	能生生所生者，習因招苦果也。	003	The able producer produces the produced refers to the habit cause attracting the effect of suffering.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c23_11']	所生還生能生者，於苦果上還起集因，因又招果，故云苦集迴轉。	所生還生能生者，於苦果上還起集因，因又招果，故云苦集迴轉。	003	The produced again produces the able producer means that on top of the effect of suffering, one again gives rise to the cause of accumulation. The cause again attracts the effect, so it is said that suffering and accumulation revolve.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c24_6']	道名能壞者，戒定慧能治苦集也。	道名能壞者，戒定慧能治苦集也。	003	The path is called the able destroyer means that precepts, concentration, and wisdom can cure suffering and accumulation.
['ZH_T38_1766_003:0028c25_2']	滅是所壞者，苦集盡處名滅諦也。	滅是所壞者，苦集盡處名滅諦也。	003	Extinction is the destroyed means that the place where suffering and accumulation are exhausted is called the truth of extinction.

The last three passages in the explanation of the four truths wisdom state as the sutra says, all referring to the two chapters.

['ZH_T38_1766_003:0029a01_8']	解苦無苦者，陰入皆如，無苦可捨；	解苦無苦者，陰入皆如，無苦可捨；	003	Understanding suffering as having no suffering means that the aggregates and sense bases are all suchness, with no suffering to abandon;

In order to make it easier to understand, the four propositions are collectively called the name, non-arising non-arising is the essence, non-arising arising is the purport, arising non-arising is the function, and such explanation is the teaching. Not only is the meaning of the essence of the sūtra clarified, but the other meanings are also revealed.
