If so, how can the seeds increase later when there is no present perfuming? Answer: The power of the perfuming thoughts that give rise to delusions is superior, and the substance of the perfumed seeds increases more and more later.

The second explanation is that increase means that the power of the seven branches to prevent evil delusions on the seeds increases exponentially.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b06_1']	何所以者。	何所以者。	02a	Why is this so?
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b06_10']	要現熏習種方生故。	要現熏習種方生故。	02a	Because the seeds must be perfumed by the present [mind] in order to arise.

['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b12_13']	本有勢力不及新故。	本有勢力不及新故。	02a	Because the power of the originally existing [substance] is not as good as the new [substance].

['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b23_6']	若於此時起住不同分心。	若於此時起住不同分心。	02a	If at this time one gives rise to a mind that is not of the same class as the original mind,
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b23_11']	或在無心。	或在無心。	02a	or if one is in a mindless state,🔽then the establishment of the non-manifest action is based on the last mind that is the proximate cause and the original intention.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b25_8']	即依前位近因等起末後心立　二云始初乞惑乃至第三羯磨後念所熏成種。	即依前位近因等起末後心立　二云始初乞惑乃至第三羯磨後念所熏成種。	02a	The second opinion is that the seeds perfumed from the first request for ordination up to the third announcement are all able to increase and grow,
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b25_17']	期心滿故皆可增長。	期心滿故皆可增長。	02a	because the original intention is fulfilled.🔽Therefore, it is permissible to establish it in a general way based on many seeds.🔽If this is so, how can the first moment only establish one set of seven branches of non-manifest form?
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b28_2']	故可總依多種假立　若爾如何初念唯立一具七支無表色耶　答種雖有多各各有能。	故可總依多種假立　若爾如何初念唯立一具七支無表色耶　答種雖有多各各有能。	02a	The answer is: although there are many seeds, each has its own function.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b28_12']	唯防一具身．語七支。	唯防一具身．語七支。	02a	It only prevents one set of seven branches of bodily and verbal action.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b29_2']	故說初念唯有七支。	故說初念唯有七支。	02a	Therefore, it is said that the first moment only has seven branches.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840b29_7']	實非唯七。	實非唯七。	02a	In reality, it is not only seven.

['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840c02_16']	非依多種無有前失。	非依多種無有前失。	02a	It is not based on many seeds, and there is no previous mistake.

['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840c10_3']	功能力齊有依．不依所以無故。	功能力齊有依．不依所以無故。	02a	There is no reason why it should not be able to give rise to nonmanifest action.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840c10_12']	非如有宗表唯一念。	非如有宗表唯一念。	02a	It is not like the theory of the SAUTRĀNTIKAS, in which manifest action is only one moment.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840c11_3']	大乘身．語既相續流。	大乘身．語既相續流。	02a	In the MAHĀYĀNA, bodily and vocal action continues in a series,
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840c11_12']	能發彼思皆名表故。	能發彼思皆名表故。	02a	and the volition that is able to give rise to it is called manifest action.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840c12_3']	故無表色依多念思。	故無表色依多念思。	02a	Therefore nonmanifest action is based on the volition of many moments.
['ZH_T43_1833_02a:0840c12_12']	但表皆能發無表故。	但表皆能發無表故。	02a	But all manifest action is able to give rise to nonmanifest action.
