['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c06_0', 'ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c07_4']	為三釋。一云無性先陳。三性後說。今釋外🔽難即指論。	為三釋。一云無性先陳。三性後說。今釋外 難即指論。	divided into three interpretations. The first says that Asvabhāva first mentioned and later explained the three natures. Now, in explaining the objections raised by others, he points to the treatise,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c07_15']	云即依此前所明三性中。	云即依此前所明三性中。	saying: Immediately relying on the three natures that were clarified previously,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c08_10']	世尊經中後時解說三種無性。	世尊經中後時解說三種無性。	the World-Honored One later explained in the sūtras the three kinds of naturelessness.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c09_1']	雖前總說諸法無性。	雖前總說諸法無性。	Although the naturelessness of all dharmas was generally explained before,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c09_10']	不為顯說三種無性。	不為顯說三種無性。	it was not clearly explained that there are three kinds of naturelessness.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c10_5']	後方分別所說無者即依三性。	後方分別所說無者即依三性。	Later, when distinguishing what was said to be nonexistent, it is based on the three natures.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c10_11']	云立彼後說。	云立彼後說。	It is said that the later explanation is established based on this.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c11_2']	非三性後方說無性。	非三性後方說無性。	It is not that the three natures are later explained to be natureless.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c11_15']	如第一卷釋外難云若唯有識。	如第一卷釋外難云若唯有識。	Like the first fascicle, in explaining the objections raised by others, it says: If there is only consciousness,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c12_10']	云何世間及諸聖教說有我法。	云何世間及諸聖教說有我法。	how is it that the world and the holy teachings speak of self and dharmas?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c13_5']	論主為答所說我法皆依識變。	論主為答所說我法皆依識變。	The treatise author answers by saying that the self and dharmas spoken of are all based on the transformations of consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c13_16']	不是先說唯識後說我法。	不是先說唯識後說我法。	It is not that only consciousness is first explained and then self and dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c15_1']	此解亦順深密三時　問既三性後陳無性先說。	此解亦順深密三時　問既三性後陳無性先說。	This explanation also accords with the three periods of time in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. Question: Since the three natures are mentioned later and the absence of nature is mentioned first,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c16_11']	何故此論及深密等先明三性　答欲顯無性必依三性是故先舉。	何故此論及深密等先明三性　答欲顯無性必依三性是故先舉。	why do this treatise and the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra and so forth first clarify the three natures? Answer: In order to show that the absence of nature must rely on the three natures, therefore they are first mentioned.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c16_15']	何以故。	何以故。	Why is this?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c17_10']	為能遍計必依所計方起妄執。	為能遍計必依所計方起妄執。	Because the ability to falsely grasp must rely on what is grasped before it can arise.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c19_13']	所以先舉　問若爾何故深密經中先說三性　答彼為德本菩薩先問於何齊何立善巧菩薩。	所以先舉　問若爾何故深密經中先說三性　答彼為德本菩薩先問於何齊何立善巧菩薩。	Therefore they are first mentioned. Question: If that is so, why does the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra first explain the three natures? Answer: That is because the Bodhisattva of Meritorious Virtue first asked, From what and up to what is the skillful bodhisattva established?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c20_13']	世尊為答於此三性齊此三性施設善巧。	世尊為答於此三性齊此三性施設善巧。	The World-Honored One answered, Up to these three natures, skillful means are established with regard to these three natures.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c21_5']	非始問答所說三性。	非始問答所說三性。	The three natures explained in the question and answer are not the first ones.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c22_5']	如百法論問答一切法及以無我非先不說。	如百法論問答一切法及以無我非先不說。	Just as in the Hundred Dharmas Treatise, the question and answer about all dharmas and no-self were not explained first.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c22_16']	又深密經中勝義生菩薩。	又深密經中勝義生菩薩。	Moreover, in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, the Bodhisattva Viśālamati
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c23_7']	不牒前說三性為問。	不牒前說三性為問。	did not ask about the previously explained three natures.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c24_3']	但舉世尊先說諸蘊．諦等善巧。	但舉世尊先說諸蘊．諦等善巧。	He only brought up the skillful means of the aggregates, truths, and so forth that the World-Honored One previously explained.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c24_16']	何故復立一切諸法皆無自性。	何故復立一切諸法皆無自性。	Why is it also established that all dharmas are without self-nature?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c25_7']	明不是前先說三性。	明不是前先說三性。	It clarifies that it is not the three natures that were previously explained.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c25_16']	今外舉經難此前說。	今外舉經難此前說。	Now, the sutra is cited externally to challenge the previous explanation.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c27_7']	故論主答不違彼教後說無性　一云前．後經說三性．無性。	故論主答不違彼教後說無性　一云前．後經說三性．無性。	Therefore, the treatise master answers that it does not contradict that teaching, later explaining that there is no nature. One says that the previous and later sutras explain the three natures and the absence of nature.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c27_16']	故今論云即依此前。	故今論云即依此前。	Therefore, the treatise now says based on the previous.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c28_2']	此前兼二。	此前兼二。	The previous includes two.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c28_7']	依此論前。	依此論前。	Based on the previous of this treatise,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c28_16']	及依經前說三自性。	及依經前說三自性。	and based on the previous of the sutra, the three natures are explained.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0790c29_10']	觀生意樂密意趣故後立無性。	觀生意樂密意趣故後立無性。	Because it observes the intention and secret purport, later the absence of nature is established.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a01_12']	今此為會顯不相違　問何故先說三種自性。	今此為會顯不相違　問何故先說三種自性。	Now this is to reconcile and show that they are not contradictory. The question is why the three kinds of natures were explained first,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a02_6']	後說無性　答順機欲故。	後說無性　答順機欲故。	and the absence of nature later. The answer is in accordance with the desire of the faculties.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a02_15']	欲顯無性依三性故。	欲顯無性依三性故。	It is in order to show that the absence of nature is based on the three natures.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a03_4']	故顯揚十六云。	故顯揚十六云。	Therefore, the sixteenth chapter of the Manifestation of the Essence says:
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a03_13']	當知無性不離自性。	當知無性不離自性。	It should be known that the absence of nature is not apart from the nature.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a05_1']	是故先說三自性義　問若爾何故說三性教為第三時。	是故先說三自性義　問若爾何故說三性教為第三時。	Therefore, the meaning of the three natures is explained first. The question is, if that is so, why is the teaching of the three natures said to be the third period?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a05_6']	應第二時。	應第二時。	It should be the second period.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a05_11']	在空前故。	在空前故。	Because it is before the emptiness of emptiness.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a05_16']	又准深密。	又准深密。	Moreover, according to the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra,🔽they sit together in one sūtra, not before or after.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a06_16']	同坐一經非前．後故　答經辨三時非約前後。	同坐一經非前．後故　答經辨三時非約前後。	The sūtra distinguishes the three periods, not according to sequence.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a07_8']	但以類相從有為第一。	但以類相從有為第一。	But it is just that the conditioned is the first,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a07_13']	空為第二。	空為第二。	emptiness is the second,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a08_1']	俱為第三。	俱為第三。	and both are the third.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a08_10']	以三自性遍計是空。	以三自性遍計是空。	Because the three natures are empty of the imagined,🔽and the other two are existent, so they are the third.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a09_14']	餘二是有故當第三　又據漸悟一類菩薩說此三時。	餘二是有故當第三　又據漸悟一類菩薩說此三時。	Moreover, this is said based on the gradual enlightenment of a certain type of bodhisattva.🔽It is not based on sudden enlightenment.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a10_11']	非望頓悟　若爾何故先說了義。	非望頓悟　若爾何故先說了義。	If that is so, why is the definitive meaning explained first,🔽and the non-definitive later?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a11_6']	後陳不了　答華嚴等云。	後陳不了　答華嚴等云。	The Huayan Sūtra and others say:
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a11_15']	譬如日出先耀高山。	譬如日出先耀高山。	It is like the sun first shining on the high mountains.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a12_9']	於大乘教頓悟先熟故先三性。	於大乘教頓悟先熟故先三性。	Because the sudden enlightenment in the Mahāyāna teachings is first ripe, the three natures are first explained.🔽The gradual enlightenment is accomplished later, so the naturelessness is explained later.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a13_10']	漸悟後成後說無性　若爾復違法華等教。	漸悟後成後說無性　若爾復違法華等教。	If that is so, it contradicts the teachings of the Lotus Sūtra and others,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a14_6']	以為漸悟第二說空第三空有。	以為漸悟第二說空第三空有。	which take the gradual enlightenment as explaining emptiness second and naturelessness third.🔽How can it be said that it is for the sake of gradual enlightenment that emptiness is explained later?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a15_14']	如何得言為漸悟故後時說空　答約頓．漸二性無性在後。	如何得言為漸悟故後時說空　答約頓．漸二性無性在後。	The answer is that based on the two natures of sudden and gradual, naturelessness is later.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a16_11']	偏據漸悟初．中．後殊空為第二。	偏據漸悟初．中．後殊空為第二。	Biasedly relying on gradual enlightenment, the initial, middle, and later distinctions of emptiness are the second.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a17_5']	今此論中通對頓．漸兩教前後。	今此論中通對頓．漸兩教前後。	Now, in this treatise, it is generally applied to the teachings before and after both the sudden and gradual teachings.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a18_2']	故云即依此前頓悟菩薩所聞三性。	故云即依此前頓悟菩薩所聞三性。	Therefore, it is said: Relying on the three natures heard by the bodhisattvas of sudden enlightenment,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a18_15']	後時為彼漸悟菩薩密立無性。	後時為彼漸悟菩薩密立無性。	Later, for the bodhisattvas of gradual enlightenment, the nature of non-existence is secretly established.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a19_2']	故不相違。	故不相違。	Therefore, there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a19_11']	本疏所明意含二解。	本疏所明意含二解。	The meaning explained in the original commentary includes two interpretations.🔽This accords with the sutra text, having emptiness before and after.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a20_10']	此順經文有前空後　又釋二教非定前後。	此順經文有前空後　又釋二教非定前後。	Another explanation: The two teachings are not necessarily before and after.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a21_8']	深密且對一類宜聞有．空前．後。	深密且對一類宜聞有．空前．後。	The profound and secret is just for one type that prefers to hear existence and emptiness before and after.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a21_16']	論云即依此前等。	論云即依此前等。	The treatise says: Relying on the previous, etc.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a22_8']	此順華嚴如來以一語言中。	此順華嚴如來以一語言中。	This accords with the Huayan, where the Tathāgata, in a single word,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a22_17']	演出無邊契經海文。	演出無邊契經海文。	Emanates the boundless ocean of sūtras.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a23_8']	各有一理任情取捨。	各有一理任情取捨。	Each has a principle, to be taken or rejected according to one's preference.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a23_13']	然第二勝。	然第二勝。	However, the second is superior.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a24_4']	依文對機有差別故。	依文對機有差別故。	Because it relies on the text and accords with the capacities of sentient beings, there are differences.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a25_1']	論。	論。	Treatise.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a25_12']	雖依他起非勝義故等者。	雖依他起非勝義故等者。	Although the dependent origination is not the ultimate truth, etc.,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a25_18']	云非者無也。	云非者無也。	The word non means no.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a26_10']	無無分別智所緣之義故。	無無分別智所緣之義故。	Because there is no meaning that is the object of nondiscriminating cognition.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a26_17']	故名勝義無性。	故名勝義無性。	Therefore, it is called the nature of the ultimate non-existence.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a27_6']	故顯揚十六云。	故顯揚十六云。	Therefore, the 16th chapter of the Abhidharmasamuccaya says:
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a27_13']	由無勝義性故。	由無勝義性故。	Because there is no nature of the ultimate,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a28_11']	此意依他名勝義無自性性者有二義。	此意依他名勝義無自性性者有二義。	This means that the other-dependent is called the nature of the ultimate non-self-nature. There are two meanings.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a29_5']	一由依他體非勝義性故。	一由依他體非勝義性故。	First, because the essence of the other-dependent is not the nature of the ultimate,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a29_12']	名勝義無性性。	名勝義無性性。	It is called the nature of the ultimate non-existence.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791a29_17']	無者非也。	無者非也。	The word no means not.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b01_8']	一由依他無自然生性。	一由依他無自然生性。	Second, because the other-dependent has no naturally arising nature,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b02_10']	亦名無自性性　若爾應云勝義生無自性性。	亦名無自性性　若爾應云勝義生無自性性。	It is also called the nature of no self-nature. If that is so, it should be called the nature of the ultimate arising non-self-nature.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b03_13']	何故但云勝義無自性性　答言勝義無無彼勝義。	何故但云勝義無自性性　答言勝義無無彼勝義。	Why is it only called the nature of the ultimate non-self-nature? The answer is: The ultimate has no non-ultimate.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b04_6']	若言生無恐緣生亦無。	若言生無恐緣生亦無。	If it is said that arising is non-existent, it is feared that conditioned arising is also non-existent.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b04_13']	又不無生無故。	又不無生無故。	Moreover, because the non-existence of arising is not non-existent,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b05_1']	但言勝義無。	但言勝義無。	It is only said that the ultimate is non-existent.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b05_6']	又濫二性。	又濫二性。	Moreover, it is confused with the two natures.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b06_1']	亦是勝義亦是生無前已說生無。	亦是勝義亦是生無前已說生無。	It is also the ultimate and also the non-existence of arising. The non-existence of arising has already been explained before.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b06_12']	今但說勝義無故不雙無。	今但說勝義無故不雙無。	Now, only the non-existence of the ultimate is explained, so it is not both non-existent.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b07_5']	又復依他不但自然生無。	又復依他不但自然生無。	Moreover, it is not only that the dependent nature does not naturally arise.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b07_16']	所執相亦無故不言生無。	所執相亦無故不言生無。	The characteristics grasped by the imagined nature also do not exist, so it is not said that they do not arise.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b08_5']	又復無彼勝義無。	又復無彼勝義無。	Moreover, there is no ultimate non-existence.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b08_11']	不無相生無。	不無相生無。	The non-existence of arising of characteristics is not non-existent.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b09_1', 'ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b10_5']	據無分別智境義。🔽依他不是故云非勝義　問何故不名非勝義無性。	據無分別智境義。 依他不是故云非勝義　問何故不名非勝義無性。	Based on the meaning of the realm of non-discriminating cognition.🔽The dependent nature is not, so it is said to be not ultimate. Why is it not called non-ultimate naturelessness?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b11_6']	而云勝義無性　答顯密義故云勝義無性。	而云勝義無性　答顯密義故云勝義無性。	Why is it said to be ultimate naturelessness? The answer is: in order to reveal the hidden meaning, it is said to be ultimate naturelessness.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b11_17']	勝義是相生無之所顯性。	勝義是相生無之所顯性。	Ultimate is the naturelessness of arising of characteristics that is revealed.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b12_8']	又顯依他上勝義性無。	又顯依他上勝義性無。	Moreover, it reveals that the ultimate nature above the dependent nature does not exist.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b12_15']	即勝義無之性。	即勝義無之性。	It is the nature of ultimate naturelessness.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b13_3']	亦名勝義無性。	亦名勝義無性。	It is also called ultimate naturelessness.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b13_8']	略去之言。	略去之言。	The word of is omitted.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b14_14']	總云勝義無性性　何以得知有其之言　答深密第二云。	總云勝義無性性　何以得知有其之言　答深密第二云。	It is generally said to be ultimate naturelessness. How do we know there is the word of? The answer is: the second chapter of the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra says:
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b15_14']	無自性性之所顯故　若四俗真相對而辨。	無自性性之所顯故　若四俗真相對而辨。	Because it is revealed by the nature of non-nature. If the four conventional and true natures are distinguished,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b16_9']	依他亦是後得勝智家之境義。	依他亦是後得勝智家之境義。	the dependent nature is also the realm of the subsequently attained superior cognition.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b16_14']	若約親緣。	若約親緣。	If it is based on direct perception,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b17_11']	後得相分亦得是清淨所緣名為勝義。	後得相分亦得是清淨所緣名為勝義。	The subsequently acquired aspect is also called the pure object, and is called the ultimate.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b18_5']	深密等但說根本清淨所緣。	深密等但說根本清淨所緣。	The Ghanavyūha Sūtra, etc. only speak of the fundamental pure object.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b19_5']	云依他起非是清淨所緣　又勝義有三義。	云依他起非是清淨所緣　又勝義有三義。	How is the dependent nature not the pure object? Moreover, the ultimate has three meanings.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b19_10']	一勝之義。	一勝之義。	First, the meaning of supremacy.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0791b19_15']	二勝為義。	二勝為義。	Second, supremacy as the meaning.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0793c28_9']	法恚即嗔。	法恚即嗔。	The hatred of dharmas is anger.🔽How can it be indeterminate?

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a19_7']	而能三事練磨其心。	而能三事練磨其心。	But one is able to train one's mind with these three things.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a22_13']	以唯在定。	以唯在定。	Because it is only in concentration.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a25_9']	所知未全。	所知未全。	the [afflictions] regarding the knowable are not yet completely [subdued].

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a27_17']	不爾如何五地方斷。	不爾如何五地方斷。	If it were not so, how could it be eliminated on the fifth ground?
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a28_7']	設不起現種至此除。	設不起現種至此除。	Even if one does not give rise to the manifest [afflictions], the seeds are eliminated upon reaching this [fifth] ground.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a28_16']	故未斷前猶須練磨。	故未斷前猶須練磨。	Therefore, before it is eliminated, one still needs to refine and subdue [the mind].
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a29_7']	論且舉初影顯於後。	論且舉初影顯於後。	The treatise only mentions the first [obstacle], but by implication the others are also [eliminated].
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794a29_16']	如斷四處不唯地前。	如斷四處不唯地前。	Just as the elimination of the four [types of] grasping does not only occur before the grounds,🔽doubt and the grasping of non-doubt and discrimination still exist on the seventh ground.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794b03_1']	論文不說通地上故。	論文不說通地上故。	because the treatise does not say that they extend to the grounds above [the first ground].
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794b03_14']	地上二障煩惱障品皆能伏故。	地上二障煩惱障品皆能伏故。	Because on the grounds above [the first ground], the two obstacles, in the category of afflictive obstructions, are all able to be subdued.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0794b04_4']	所除四處據分別說。	所除四處據分別說。	The four obstacles that are eliminated [on the first ground] are discussed in terms of discrimination.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0797c19_8']	一云即各三品先斷煩惱三品之中。	一云即各三品先斷煩惱三品之中。	One says: It is the three grades of each. First, it cuts off the three grades of afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0797c20_2']	各有無間．解脫成其六心。	各有無間．解脫成其六心。	One says: The three grades of afflictions are first eliminated. Within the three grades, there are six minds of uninterrupted and liberated [paths].
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0797c21_4']	次斷所知既起異類斷道即起勝進復有一心。	次斷所知既起異類斷道即起勝進復有一心。	Next, in eliminating the knowable, since the path of elimination of different types arises, there is also one mind of advancement.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0797c22_11']	欲入相見起一勝進。	欲入相見起一勝進。	In order to enter the path of seeing, one generates one mind of advancement.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a01_5']	實相見道重法於前。	實相見道重法於前。	The real aspect-seeing path is based on the previous dharma.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a01_10']	以曾得故。	以曾得故。	Because it has been attained before,

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a02_3']	中．上合法。	中．上合法。	The middle and upper grades combine the dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a02_8']	故說三心。	故說三心。	Therefore, it is said to be three minds.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a03_6']	非實如是　二云所斷之障雖成六品。	非實如是　二云所斷之障雖成六品。	It is not really like this. The second explanation is that although the obstacles to be eliminated are formed into six grades,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a03_15']	斷煩惱已欲斷所知。	斷煩惱已欲斷所知。	after eliminating the afflictions, one wishes to eliminate the knowable.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a04_14']	一類緣真更不別起勝進方入斷所知道。	一類緣真更不別起勝進方入斷所知道。	A single type of mind takes the truth as its object and does not give rise to superior progress again, and then enters the elimination of the path of knowing.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a06_1']	故十三心真見究竟　三云從真入相以曾修故。	故十三心真見究竟　三云從真入相以曾修故。	Therefore, the thirteen minds truly see the ultimate. The third explanation is that from the truth one enters the aspects, because one has cultivated them before,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a06_11']	勝入劣故亦不起勝進。	勝入劣故亦不起勝進。	and the superior enters the inferior, so one also does not give rise to superior progress.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a07_8']	但十二心　問從真入相不起勝進。	但十二心　問從真入相不起勝進。	There are only twelve minds. The question is: From the truth one enters the aspects and does not give rise to superior progress.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a09_7']	從相入修真無漏道起勝進不　答相入真修難故起勝進道　或已曾得入修。	從相入修真無漏道起勝進不　答相入真修難故起勝進道　或已曾得入修。	From the aspects one enters cultivation. Does the true untainted path give rise to superior progress or not? The answer is: Because it is difficult to enter cultivation from the aspects, one gives rise to the path of superior progress. Or one has already attained entry into cultivation,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a09_14']	不更起勝進道。	不更起勝進道。	and does not give rise to the path of superior progress again.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a10_5']	雖有二解起將為勝。	雖有二解起將為勝。	Although there are two explanations, the latter is considered superior.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a11_1']	非相見後即入修道真斷惑道。	非相見後即入修道真斷惑道。	It is not that after the path of insight one immediately enters the path of cultivation and truly eliminates the passions.🔽In the interval, one generates the various kinds of superior powers and only later enters the true path of cultivation and elimination.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a12_16']	中間起散別時方入修真斷道故有勝進　四云准第十云二乘根鈍漸斷障時。	中間起散別時方入修真斷道故有勝進　四云准第十云二乘根鈍漸斷障時。	The fourth opinion is that of the tenth chapter of the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra, which says that those of the two vehicles, because their faculties are dull, when they gradually eliminate obstacles,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a13_9']	必各別起無間．解脫。	必各別起無間．解脫。	they necessarily generate the uninterrupted and liberated paths separately.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a13_14']	菩薩不爾。	菩薩不爾。	Bodhisattvas are not like this.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a14_4']	即後無間是前解脫。	即後無間是前解脫。	The subsequent uninterrupted path is the preceding liberated path.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a14_17']	斷煩惱時有三剎那無間斷道。	斷煩惱時有三剎那無間斷道。	When they eliminate the passions, there are three moments of uninterrupted paths of elimination.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a15_8']	起勝進道欲斷所知。	起勝進道欲斷所知。	When they generate the path of superior faculties and desire to eliminate the knowable,
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a16_3']	即為煩惱第三無間之解脫。	即為煩惱第三無間之解脫。	they are the liberated path of the third uninterrupted path of the passions.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a16_8']	即有四心。	即有四心。	There are then four moments.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a16_17']	斷所知中三品亦爾。	斷所知中三品亦爾。	The elimination of the three classes of the knowable is also like this.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a17_7']	欲入相見起勝進道。	欲入相見起勝進道。	When they desire to enter the path of insight, they generate the path of superior faculties.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a17_16']	即為第三無間解脫。	即為第三無間解脫。	They are the third uninterrupted path and the liberated path.🔽Therefore, true insight is perfected in eight moments.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a19_9']	故但八心真見究竟　五云斷煩惱障三無間已即斷所知不起勝進。	故但八心真見究竟　五云斷煩惱障三無間已即斷所知不起勝進。	The fifth opinion is that of Sthiramati, who says that after the three uninterrupted paths of elimination of the obstacle of the passions, one then eliminates the knowable and does not generate the path of superior faculties.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a20_1']	即以所知初無間道。	即以所知初無間道。	The first uninterrupted path of the knowable
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a20_14']	為彼煩惱第三無間之解脫道。	為彼煩惱第三無間之解脫道。	is the liberated path of the third uninterrupted path of the passions.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a21_4']	故但七心真見究竟。	故但七心真見究竟。	Therefore, only seven minds truly see the ultimate.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a21_11']	准此應為六釋。	准此應為六釋。	According to this, there should be six explanations.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a22_3']	以入相見亦除勝進。	以入相見亦除勝進。	Because entering the characteristics and seeing also excludes the superior progress.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a22_17']	准前一解　又解二障各分上下。	准前一解　又解二障各分上下。	According to the previous one explanation. Another explanation: The two hindrances are each divided into upper and lower.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a23_8']	麁細難易斷差別故。	麁細難易斷差別故。	Because of the differences in subtlety, difficulty, and ease of elimination.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a24_7']	如佛十力根上下力中根隨應屬上下故。	如佛十力根上下力中根隨應屬上下故。	Just as in the power of the upper and lower faculties among the ten powers of the Buddha, the faculties belong to the upper and lower as appropriate.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a24_12', 'ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a25_7']	斷障亦爾。🔽中品隨應由觀行者意樂力故。	斷障亦爾。 中品隨應由觀行者意樂力故。	Eliminating the hindrances is also like this.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a27_15']	隨上下斷故各分二　若爾云何名為漸斷　答由上下別得名為漸　又解本意二障各二不分中品。	隨上下斷故各分二　若爾云何名為漸斷　答由上下別得名為漸　又解本意二障各二不分中品。	The middle grade is eliminated according to the power of the practitioner's intention as appropriate. Therefore, each is divided into two. If so, how is it called gradual elimination? The answer is: It is called gradual because of the difference between upper and lower. Another explanation: The original intention is that the two hindrances each have two, not dividing the middle grade.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a28_7']	以各麁細易難斷故。	以各麁細易難斷故。	Because each has coarse and subtle, easy and difficult to eliminate.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a28_16']	二障合有四品斷別。	二障合有四品斷別。	The two hindrances combined have four grades of elimination.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a29_7']	亦有五釋義准前明。	亦有五釋義准前明。	There are also five explanations, the meaning of which is clarified according to the previous.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798a29_16']	准其義加亦應六釋。	准其義加亦應六釋。	According to the meaning, it should also be six explanations.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b01_3']	義亦如前。	義亦如前。	The meaning is also as before.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b01_8']	又解二障。	又解二障。	Another explanation: The two hindrances.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b01_13']	各分上下。	各分上下。	Each is divided into upper and lower.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b02_3']	二障下品必各別斷。	二障下品必各別斷。	The lower grades of the two obstacles must each be eliminated separately.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b02_8']	以創斷故。	以創斷故。	Because they are newly eliminated.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b02_17']	二障上品即合共斷。	二障上品即合共斷。	The upper grades of the two obstacles are combined and eliminated together.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b03_7']	以能重起斷障道故。	以能重起斷障道故。	Because they are able to repeatedly arise and eliminate the path of obstacles.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b03_16']	以前斷彼二下品故。	以前斷彼二下品故。	Because the previous elimination of the two lower grades
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b04_7']	即以煩惱下品為下。	即以煩惱下品為下。	makes the lower grade of afflictions the lower.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b04_14']	所知下品為中。	所知下品為中。	The lower grade of knowables is the middle.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b05_1']	望初難故。	望初難故。	Because it is difficult to eliminate at the beginning.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b05_8']	二各上品為上。	二各上品為上。	The two upper grades are the upper.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b05_13']	以難斷故。	以難斷故。	Because they are difficult to eliminate.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b05_18']	既三品斷。	既三品斷。	Since there are three grades of elimination,

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b13_8']	二云六心。	二云六心。	Second, it says six minds.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b13_13']	除勝進道。	除勝進道。	Excluding the path of superior progress.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0798b13_18']	三云五心。	三云五心。	Third, it says five minds.

Question: Since there are seven and four moments of difference, how can it be called sudden? Answer: The two obstacles are simultaneously eliminated, which is called sudden. If so, how does the Fifty-Eight Treatise, etc., speak of three minds? Answer: The three minds are the same as the previous gradual elimination explanation.

The second says they do not enter. If that is so, why is it said that the pratyekabuddhas attain the fruit of pratyekabuddhahood with thirty-four [moments of the] mind? The answer is: that is said by the Hīnayāna.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0802b07_9']	此意因果皆欲修證名為攝善。	此意因果皆欲修證名為攝善。	This means that both cause and effect are called embracing wholesome dharmas because they are both what is cultivated and what is realized.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0802c05_13']	既異生性體亦是障。	既異生性體亦是障。	Since the nature of ordinary beings is also a hindrance,

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0802c15_1']	西明說異生性通依現種者不爾。	西明說異生性通依現種者不爾。	The Ximing interpretation that the nature of being an ordinary being is common to both actual dharmas and seeds is not so.

['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0802c23_8']	故云應知愚品總說為愚。	故云應知愚品總說為愚。	Therefore it is said that the various kinds of ignorance should be understood as collectively referred to as ignorance.
['ZH_T43_1832_07a:0802c24_2']	若云執著我法愚即是無明。	若云執著我法愚即是無明。	If it is said that the ignorance that is attached to the view of self and dharmas is itself ignorance,
