['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b13_0']	功德同無相□□□□自此以來明有大利益。今舉智辯無相結攝受無邊。	功德同無相□□□□自此以來明有大利益。今舉智辯無相結攝受無邊。	001	Merits are the same as signlessness. From here on, it clarifies that there are great benefits. Now, it raises the signlessness of wisdom and eloquence to conclude the acceptance of the boundless.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b15_20']	佛告勝鬘汝今更說一切諸佛所說攝受正法得理□□□□□□□□□說名一乘將明空解。	佛告勝鬘汝今更說一切諸佛所說攝受正法得理□□□□□□□□□說名一乘將明空解。	001	The Buddha told Śrīmālā, You should now explain what all buddhas have said about accepting the true Dharma and attaining the principle. The Dharma that is explained is called the One Vehicle. It is about to clarify the understanding of emptiness.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b17_15']	即是出相故命更說之勝鬘白佛言善哉世尊唯然受教攝受淵曠求或無崖命演斯利得不說乎即白佛言世尊攝受正法者是摩訶衍攝受空解。	即是出相故命更說之勝鬘白佛言善哉世尊唯然受教攝受淵曠求或無崖命演斯利得不說乎即白佛言世尊攝受正法者是摩訶衍攝受空解。	001	It is precisely the emergence of signlessness, so it commands her to explain it again. Śrīmālā said to the Buddha, Excellent, World-Honored One! I will respectfully receive the teaching. Accepting the Dharma is vast and boundless, and seeking it may be endless. Why not explain the benefits of expounding it? She then said to the Buddha, World-Honored One, accepting the true Dharma is the Mahāyāna. Accepting the understanding of emptiness,
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b19_14']	即大乘出相何以故三乘空解何以即之一大摩訶衍者出生一切聲聞緣覺世間出世間善法三乘空解皆從理出。	即大乘出相何以故三乘空解何以即之一大摩訶衍者出生一切聲聞緣覺世間出世間善法三乘空解皆從理出。	001	Why is it so? The three vehicles' understanding of emptiness is all included in the one great Mahāyāna. The great Mahāyāna gives rise to all the good dharmas of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and the mundane and supramundane. The three vehicles' understanding of emptiness all arises from principle.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b20_9']	理出無出悟即同入同入無入故無不入。	理出無出悟即同入同入無入故無不入。	001	Principle gives rise to without giving rise. Realization is the same as entering. Entering is without entering, therefore there is nothing that is not entered.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b22_22']	一三之義得不然也世尊如阿耨大池出八大河如是摩訶衍出生一切聲聞緣覺世間出世間善法泉源淵曠滿隨通流。	一三之義得不然也世尊如阿耨大池出八大河如是摩訶衍出生一切聲聞緣覺世間出世間善法泉源淵曠滿隨通流。	001	The meaning of one and three can be understood in this way. World-Honored One, just as the great lake Anavatapta gives rise to the eight great rivers, so does the Mahāyāna give rise to all the good dharmas of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and the mundane and supramundane. The spring source is vast and full, flowing with the openings.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b23_3']	流從處異。	流從處異。	001	The flows differ from the place of origin.

['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b23_28']	虛解常同。	虛解常同。	001	The empty understanding is always the same.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b23_39']	同從出異出無不同世尊。	同從出異出無不同世尊。	001	The same arises from the different, but there is no difference in the same. World-Honored One,
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b24_12']	又如一切種子皆依於地而得生長。	又如一切種子皆依於地而得生長。	001	it is also like all seeds relying on the earth to grow and flourish.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b26_8']	如是一切聲聞緣覺世間出世間善法依於大乘而得增長其生無異長亦同之。	如是一切聲聞緣覺世間出世間善法依於大乘而得增長其生無異長亦同之。	001	In this way, all the good dharmas of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and the mundane and supramundane [paths] of the world rely on the Mahāyāna to increase and grow. Their arising is no different, and their growth is the same.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b26_13']	是故世尊。	是故世尊。	001	Therefore, the World-Honored One,
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b28_1']	住於大乘攝受大乘即住於二乘攝受二乘一切世間出世間善法以理統名則名無異也。	住於大乘攝受大乘即住於二乘攝受二乘一切世間出世間善法以理統名則名無異也。	001	abiding in the Mahāyāna and embracing the Mahāyāna, abides in the two vehicles and embraces the two vehicles, as well as all the good dharmas of the mundane and supramundane [paths] of the world. Governing them with principle, they are then called no different.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b28_8']	如世尊說六處。	如世尊說六處。	001	As the World-Honored One said, there are six aspects.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278b28_13']	何等為六。	何等為六。	001	What are the six?
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c01_13']	謂正法住正法滅波羅提木叉比尼出家受具足為大乘故說此六處夫一極之道非小心所尋故。	謂正法住正法滅波羅提木叉比尼出家受具足為大乘故說此六處夫一極之道非小心所尋故。	001	They are the abiding of the true Dharma, the extinction of the true Dharma, the Prātimokṣa, the Vinaya, going forth, and receiving the full precepts. These six aspects are taught for the sake of the Mahāyāna. The ultimate Way is not sought by the small mind,
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c01_23']	以權三之名密詮一致。	以權三之名密詮一致。	001	so it secretly explains the one principle with the names of the three provisional [vehicles].
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c01_34']	是以向說三乘出於一極。	是以向說三乘出於一極。	001	Therefore, it was said earlier that the three vehicles emerge from the one ultimate.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c02_1']	今明指大作小則期通於大。	今明指大作小則期通於大。	001	Now, it is clarified that pointing to the great as the small aims to be inclusive of the great.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c02_18']	大通非小乃所謂大也何以故大小不同。	大通非小乃所謂大也何以故大小不同。	001	The great being inclusive is not the small, and this is what is called the great. Why is this so? The great and the small are not the same.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c04_18']	何以說小為大正法住者為大乘故說大乘住者即正法住正法滅者為大乘故說大乘滅者即正法滅空理湛然古今不變。	何以說小為大正法住者為大乘故說大乘住者即正法住正法滅者為大乘故說大乘滅者即正法滅空理湛然古今不變。	001	Why is it said that the small is the great Dharma abiding? It is for the sake of the Great Vehicle. Speaking of the Great Vehicle abiding is precisely the Great Dharma abiding. Speaking of the Great Dharma perishing is precisely the Great Vehicle perishing. The principle of emptiness is eternally still, unchanging throughout ancient and modern times.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c04_23']	顯之為住。	顯之為住。	001	To manifest it is abiding.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c04_28']	隱則為滅。	隱則為滅。	001	To conceal it is perishing.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c06_5']	豈離大乘別有住滅波羅提木叉比尼此二法者義一名異遮犯為木叉。	豈離大乘別有住滅波羅提木叉比尼此二法者義一名異遮犯為木叉。	001	How can there be abiding and perishing apart from the Great Vehicle? Pārājika and vinaya, these two dharmas have the same meaning but different names. Restraining offenses is pārājika.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c06_11']	治犯為比尼。	治犯為比尼。	001	Curing offenses is vinaya.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c06_20']	此二俱是大乘之義。	此二俱是大乘之義。	001	These two are both the meaning of the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c06_31']	而施小乘之稱故曰名異。	而施小乘之稱故曰名異。	001	Yet they are given the designation of the Lesser Vehicle, thus it is said they have different names.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c06_36']	名異理一。	名異理一。	001	Different names, one principle.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c07_23']	是以即之大乘比尼者即大乘學遮治離相即大乘學也何以故遮治本出於小。	是以即之大乘比尼者即大乘學遮治離相即大乘學也何以故遮治本出於小。	001	Therefore, the Great Vehicle vinaya is precisely the Great Vehicle training. Restraining and curing the characteristics of separation are precisely the Great Vehicle training. Why is this? Restraining and curing originally come from the Lesser Vehicle.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c08_16']	何以即之大也以依佛出家而受具足依大說小無別小也。	何以即之大也以依佛出家而受具足依大說小無別小也。	001	Why is it identified with the Great? Because relying on the Buddha to leave home and receive full ordination, relying on the Great to speak of the Lesser, there is no separate Lesser.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c08_22']	捨異為出家。	捨異為出家。	001	Abandoning differences is leaving home.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c11_20']	得理為具足是故說大乘威儀戒是比尼是出家是受具足小無別小故以大為小是故阿羅漢無別出家受具足何以故阿羅漢依如來出家受具足故因無別從起則同趣。	得理為具足是故說大乘威儀戒是比尼是出家是受具足小無別小故以大為小是故阿羅漢無別出家受具足何以故阿羅漢依如來出家受具足故因無別從起則同趣。	001	Attaining the principle is considered complete. Therefore, it is said that the Mahayana is the precepts of deportment, the Vinaya, the going forth, and the full ordination. The Hinayana has no separate Hinayana, so the Mahayana is considered the Hinayana. Therefore, Arhats have no separate going forth and full ordination. Why is this? Because Arhats rely on the Tathagata to go forth and receive full ordination. Because there is no separate cause, the same goal arises.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c12_4']	是以六處之義無非大乘。	是以六處之義無非大乘。	001	Therefore, the meaning of the six aspects is none other than the Mahayana.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c13_24']	阿羅漢歸依於佛阿羅漢有恐怖上說乘之開合明理一無殊。	阿羅漢歸依於佛阿羅漢有恐怖上說乘之開合明理一無殊。	001	Arhats take refuge in the Buddha. Arhats have fear. The above discusses the opening and closing of the vehicle, clarifying that the principle is not different.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c14_9', 'ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c14_16']	下明悟一出相有盡不盡。🔽盡稱乘云無餘。	下明悟一出相有盡不盡。 盡稱乘云無餘。	001	Below, it clarifies that there is one enlightenment, with characteristics that are exhausted and not exhausted.🔽The exhausted are called the vehicle without remainder.

['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c18_11']	此心是以仰依大覺何以故經言羅漢已得無為有何怖也阿羅漢於一切無行怖畏想住如人執劍欲來害已二乘捨有未盡於無未盡無行深所畏也是故阿羅漢無究竟樂有無永盡形心澹泊。	此心是以仰依大覺何以故經言羅漢已得無為有何怖也阿羅漢於一切無行怖畏想住如人執劍欲來害已二乘捨有未盡於無未盡無行深所畏也是故阿羅漢無究竟樂有無永盡形心澹泊。	001	This mind is what they look up to and rely on the Great Awakened One. Why is it so? The sutra says that arhats have already attained the unconditioned, so how can they have fear? Arhats dwell in the thought of fearlessness towards all conditioned things, just as a person holding a sword wants to come and harm them. The two vehicles have not yet exhausted existence and have not yet exhausted non-existence. The conditioned is deeply feared by them. Therefore, arhats do not have ultimate bliss. Existence and non-existence are completely exhausted, and body and mind are tranquil.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c18_20']	無相無為乃曰究竟。	無相無為乃曰究竟。	001	The signless and unconditioned is called ultimate.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c18_37']	羅漢未然得不畏也何以故受究竟之名。	羅漢未然得不畏也何以故受究竟之名。	001	Arhats have not yet attained fearlessness. Why is it so? They obtain the name of ultimate.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c21_14']	何以無究竟樂也世尊依不求依如眾生無依彼彼恐怖以恐怖故則求歸依如是阿羅漢有怖畏以怖畏故依於如來無所依求唯佛一人。	何以無究竟樂也世尊依不求依如眾生無依彼彼恐怖以恐怖故則求歸依如是阿羅漢有怖畏以怖畏故依於如來無所依求唯佛一人。	001	Why is there no ultimate bliss? The World-Honored One relies on the unobtainable reliance, just as sentient beings have no reliance and are afraid here and there. Because of fear, they seek refuge. In this way, arhats have fear. Because of fear, they rely on the Tathagata. Those who have nothing to rely on and nothing to seek are only the Buddha alone.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c21_19']	眾生未悟。	眾生未悟。	001	Sentient beings have not yet awakened.

The Hinayana is gradual and incomplete, not leading to the ultimate. The World-Honored One, Arhats, and Pratyekabuddhas have fear. Above, the meaning of taking refuge in the Great is explained, so the Hearers are explained everywhere.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c22_29']	下明恐怖不盡之行。	下明恐怖不盡之行。	001	Below, the practice of not exhausting fear is clarified.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c24_15']	是以兼及二乘是故阿羅漢辟支佛有餘生法不盡故有生二乘究竟雖有四行名曰涅槃無行。	是以兼及二乘是故阿羅漢辟支佛有餘生法不盡故有生二乘究竟雖有四行名曰涅槃無行。	001	Therefore, it also includes the Two Vehicles. Therefore, Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas have remaining birth dharmas that are not exhausted, so there is birth. Although the Two Vehicles ultimately have four practices, they are called Nirvana without practice.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c25_10']	是有之餘法有法有生生未盡也有餘梵行成故不純解雖盡有未盡於無。	是有之餘法有法有生生未盡也有餘梵行成故不純解雖盡有未盡於無。	001	This is the remaining dharma of existence. There is the dharma of existence, and birth is not yet exhausted. Because the pure practice of existence is accomplished, the understanding is not pure. Although exhausted, there is not yet exhaustion in non-existence.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c26_27']	若盡有無乃名純也事不空竟故當有所作悟未窮宗必有方解為當作不度彼故當有所斷後有相續必更有斷。	若盡有無乃名純也事不空竟故當有所作悟未窮宗必有方解為當作不度彼故當有所斷後有相續必更有斷。	001	If existence and non-existence are exhausted, it is then called pure. Because the matter is not yet empty, there must be something to be done. The realization has not yet reached the ultimate principle, and there must be a method of understanding. It is not yet crossed, so there must be something to be eliminated. The continuation of later existence will definitely have further elimination.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c27_3', 'ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c27_12']	此上則四智有餘也。🔽前二明所盡之不盡。	此上則四智有餘也。 前二明所盡之不盡。	001	The above then has the remaining four knowledges.🔽The first two clarify the non-exhaustion of what is to be exhausted.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0278c27_21']	後二明無生之更生。	後二明無生之更生。	001	The last two clarify the further arising of non-birth.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279a01_12']	不盡而生故後有不盡以不斷故去涅槃界遠後有相續則生死無窮。	不盡而生故後有不盡以不斷故去涅槃界遠後有相續則生死無窮。	001	Because it is not exhausted yet, there is birth. Therefore, the later existence is not exhausted. Because it is not cut off, it is far from the realm of nirvana. The continuation of later existence means the endlessness of birth and death.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279a01_31']	故去涅槃遠也何以故上五句本是無餘之名。	故去涅槃遠也何以故上五句本是無餘之名。	001	Therefore, it is far from nirvana. Why is this? The above five sentences are originally the name of nirvana without remainder.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279a04_29']	何故今言有餘唯有如來應等正覺得般涅槃成就一切功德故阿羅漢辟支佛不成就一切功德言得涅槃者是佛方便顯極以明有餘失神冥理極名為等覺相滅無滅名得涅槃。	何故今言有餘唯有如來應等正覺得般涅槃成就一切功德故阿羅漢辟支佛不成就一切功德言得涅槃者是佛方便顯極以明有餘失神冥理極名為等覺相滅無滅名得涅槃。	001	Why is it said now that there is remainder? Only the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One, attains parinirvāṇa and accomplishes all merits. Therefore, arhats and pratyekabuddhas do not accomplish all merits. As for those who are said to attain nirvana, it is the Buddha's skillful means to manifest the ultimate. To clarify the remainder, losing the spirit and reaching the ultimate principle is called equal enlightenment. The extinction of characteristics without extinction is called attaining nirvana.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279a05_31']	涅槃盡有名為一切盡有無生則我生已盡二乘未能盡有而受涅槃名者以終名引始遠同無生。	涅槃盡有名為一切盡有無生則我生已盡二乘未能盡有而受涅槃名者以終名引始遠同無生。	001	Nirvana that has the name of exhaustion is called all exhaustion. Non-arising means my birth is already exhausted. The two vehicles are not yet able to exhaust existence and accept the name of nirvana. Using the final name to draw the beginning, they are far the same as non-arising.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279a08_10']	即生未盡釋上生有餘也唯有如來得般涅槃成就無量功德故阿羅漢辟支佛成就有量功德言得涅槃者是佛方便窮無為無量行能窮無明梵行已立。	即生未盡釋上生有餘也唯有如來得般涅槃成就無量功德故阿羅漢辟支佛成就有量功德言得涅槃者是佛方便窮無為無量行能窮無明梵行已立。	001	Immediately giving rise to the remainder of birth explains the above having the remainder of birth. Only the Tathāgata attains parinirvāṇa and accomplishes immeasurable merit. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas accomplish immeasurable merit. Saying they attain nirvāṇa is a skillful means of the Buddha. The immeasurable practices are able to exhaust ignorance. The holy life has been established.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279a10_20']	釋上梵行不純也唯有如來得般涅槃成就不可思議功德故阿羅漢辟支佛成就思議功德言得涅槃者是佛方便不可思議者有無圓通之稱。	釋上梵行不純也唯有如來得般涅槃成就不可思議功德故阿羅漢辟支佛成就思議功德言得涅槃者是佛方便不可思議者有無圓通之稱。	001	Explains the above the holy life is not pure. Only the Tathāgata attains parinirvāṇa and accomplishes inconceivable merit. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas accomplish conceivable merit. Saying they attain nirvāṇa is a skillful means of the Buddha. Inconceivable refers to the perfect and unobstructed state.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279a10_31']	若行能圖通即所作已辦。	若行能圖通即所作已辦。	001	If the practice is able to reach perfection, then what should be done has been done.

Only the Tathāgata attains parinirvāṇa and completely eliminates all faults that should be eliminated, accomplishing the foremost purity. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas have remaining faults and are not of the foremost purity. Saying they attain nirvāṇa is a skillful means of the Buddha. Extinguishing all continuity is to eliminate.

The World-Honored One, the power of the ground of nescience is the greatest among the four abodes of craving. Above, the four abodes are compared to the seeds of nescience.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279c07_8']	今以無明力於四住下以喻譬之譬如惡魔波旬於他化自在天色力壽命眷屬眾具自在殊勝如是無明住地力於有愛數四住地其力最勝天魔處尊率下無明以本統末。	今以無明力於四住下以喻譬之譬如惡魔波旬於他化自在天色力壽命眷屬眾具自在殊勝如是無明住地力於有愛數四住地其力最勝天魔處尊率下無明以本統末。	001	Now, the power of nescience is compared to the four abodes below using a metaphor. It is like the evil Mara Pāpīyān, whose form, strength, lifespan, retinue, and possessions are supremely superior in the Heaven of Free Enjoyment of Manifestations by Others. In the same way, the power of the ground of nescience is the most supreme among the four abodes of craving. The heavenly demon occupies the highest position and leads the lower realms. Nescience governs the end based on the beginning.

In this way, the World-Honored One, the ground of nescience is the most powerful. The Buddha eliminates it. It can be said to be great. The World-Honored One, it is also like the grasping that takes contaminated karma as its cause and gives rise to the three existences. It has already revealed its power.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279c12_16']	今明其用。	今明其用。	001	Now it clarifies its function.

In this way, the ground of nescience takes pure karma as its cause and gives rise to the three kinds of mind-made bodies of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and powerful bodhisattvas. The four graspings are the conditions for the compounded.

The arising of these three kinds of mind-made bodies and the arising of pure karma depend on the ground of ignorance and have conditions, not without conditions. Therefore, the three kinds of mind-made bodies and the cause of pure karma are the ground of ignorance. The three do not arise by themselves. When they arise, they must have conditions. The ground of ignorance is the condition for the three. The World-Honored One thus counts the ground of attachment to existence as the fourth ground of attachment. It does not share the same function as the ground of ignorance. It clarifies the difference in nourishing birth from the beginning.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279c21_4']	今明斷滅之異所以不同也無明住地異離四住地佛地所斷佛菩提智所斷二乘斷四不斷無明。	今明斷滅之異所以不同也無明住地異離四住地佛地所斷佛菩提智所斷二乘斷四不斷無明。	001	Now it clarifies the difference in eradication. The reason why they are not the same is that the ground of ignorance is different and separate from the four grounds of attachment. It is eradicated by the wisdom of Buddha's enlightenment. The two vehicles eradicate the four but not ignorance.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279c23_10']	佛斷無明無四可斷所以異也何以故阿羅漢辟支佛斷四種住地無漏不盡不得自在力亦不作證上來三地分為三界四住妄取於有。	佛斷無明無四可斷所以異也何以故阿羅漢辟支佛斷四種住地無漏不盡不得自在力亦不作證上來三地分為三界四住妄取於有。	001	The Buddha has severed ignorance, which is different from the four that can be severed. Why is this? Arhats and pratyekabuddhas sever the four kinds of abodes, but they do not exhaust the outflows, do not attain mastery, and do not realize the above three stages are divided into three realms. The four abodes mistakenly grasp existence.
['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279c23_19']	於有起漏名有漏界。	於有起漏名有漏界。	001	In existence, outflows arise, called the realm of outflows.

['ZH_T85_2763_001:0279c24_8']	是以二乘雖斷有漏。	是以二乘雖斷有漏。	001	Therefore, although the two vehicles sever existence and outflows,

The exhaustion of the undefiled is precisely the exhaustion of the ground of ignorance. If it is not exhausted, then ignorance is not exhausted. World-Honored One, arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas in their final body are obscured by the ground of ignorance, and therefore they do not know and do not realize those dharmas.

Because it is not severed, it is called liberation with remaining faults, not liberation from all faults. Then, my birth has remaining existence. This is called having remaining purity, not all purity. Then, the practice of austerity has remaining. It is called accomplishing remaining merits, not all merits. Then, what is done has remaining. Because it accomplishes remaining liberation, remaining purity, and remaining merits, it is known that suffering with remaining has remaining accumulation to realize, remaining cessation to cultivate, and remaining path. Because afflictions are not exhausted, it causes what is known to have remaining. This is called attaining partial nirvāṇa. Attaining partial nirvāṇa is called heading towards the realm of nirvāṇa, having something to penetrate, and attaining is called partial.
