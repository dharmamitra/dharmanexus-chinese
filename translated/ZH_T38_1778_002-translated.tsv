If both precepts and the vehicle are strict, they are reborn in the human realm or heavens. With the body of a Śakra or Brahmā, they encounter Mahāvairocana in the seven places and nine assemblies, like the sun first shining on the high mountains;

The four statements of laxity and strictness in precepts and vehicle can be understood by analogy with the faith-practitioner, but there are slight differences in sharpness and dullness.

Those near are like those who hear the Flower Ornament Sutra and immediately believe and accept it, entering the wisdom of the Tathāgata. Those far away are like those with the capacity for gradual enlightenment. Initially they practice the two vehicles and distance themselves from the Buddha's path, but later they hear the Vaipulya and Prajñā [Sūtras], and by the Lotus Sutra and Nirvāṇa Sūtra they are all liberated by the Tathāgata's nirvāṇa. The mutual generation of the five flavors is precisely this meaning.

If their karmic rewards are exhausted, they will transmigrate in the cycle of birth and death. Therefore, it is said that it is better to be Devadatta and die to enter hell, than to be Pūraṇa and be born in the heavens to experience pleasure.
