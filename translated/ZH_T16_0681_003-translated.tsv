Turning further away, without a place to return to, they go against the holy path and lose their own benefits. Among the three vehicles, they do not even attain the Dharma of one vehicle. Bound by grasping, they do not see the truth, and do not attain entry into the land of the secret and wondrous. They do not even get to hear the name.
