['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c17_8']	6 六辯差別品第二之六又彼經主於此生疑：	6 六辯差別品第二之六又彼經主於此生疑：	Chapter 6, section 6 on the distinctions of the six [characteristics], the master of that scripture also has doubts about this:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c18_9']	爾時此法，為名安住、為名衰異、為名壞滅？	爾時此法，為名安住、為名衰異、為名壞滅？	At that time, is this dharma called abiding, called change, or called destruction?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c18_14']	今當為決。	今當為決。	Now I will resolve this.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c20_7']	已生位中，住異滅三起用各別，令所相法於一時中所望不同，具有三義。	已生位中，住異滅三起用各別，令所相法於一時中所望不同，具有三義。	In the state of having already arisen, abiding, change, and destruction each perform their own function separately, causing the dharma that is characterized to be different from what it was before in one moment, and to have all three meanings.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c20_17']	如斯通釋，何理相違？	如斯通釋，何理相違？	If it is explained like this, what principle is contradicted?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c21_5']	故彼所疑未為應理。	故彼所疑未為應理。	Therefore the doubts of that [master] are not reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c22_5']	又次前說，設許未來生有作用，如何成未來？	又次前說，設許未來生有作用，如何成未來？	Moreover, the previous explanation says, even if it is allowed that arising has function in the future, how does it become the future?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c22_11']	應說未來相。	應說未來相。	It should be explained what the characteristics of the future are.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c23_7']	法現在時生用已謝，如何成現在？	法現在時生用已謝，如何成現在？	When a dharma is in the present, the function of arising has already ceased. How does it become the present?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c23_13']	應說現在相。	應說現在相。	It should be explained what the characteristics of the present are.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c24_6']	此無所違，無非現在有作用故。	此無所違，無非現在有作用故。	This is not contradictory, because there is no present without function.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c25_14']	豈不生相未來生時能生諸法即是作用，何故乃言此唯現在？	豈不生相未來生時能生諸法即是作用，何故乃言此唯現在？	Isn’t it that when the characteristic of birth arises in the future, it can give rise to dharmas, which is precisely its activity? Why then do you say that this is only present?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c25_17']	天愛！	天愛！	O one loved by heaven!
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c26_13']	作用非汝所知，此是功能非關作用。	作用非汝所知，此是功能非關作用。	Activity is not what you know. This is a function, not related to activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c27_12']	謂有為法，若能為因引攝自果，名為作用；	謂有為法，若能為因引攝自果，名為作用；	It is said that conditioned dharmas, if able to act as causes and attract their own effects, are called activity;
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c28_7']	若能為緣攝助異類，是謂功能。	若能為緣攝助異類，是謂功能。	If able to act as conditions and assist other types of dharmas, this is called function.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0409c29_18']	如前已辯，一切現在皆能為因引攝自果，非諸現在皆能為緣攝助異類。	如前已辯，一切現在皆能為因引攝自果，非諸現在皆能為緣攝助異類。	As explained before, all present dharmas are able to act as causes and attract their own effects, but not all present dharmas are able to act as conditions and assist other types of dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a03_6']	謂闇中眼或有功能被損害者，便於眼識不能為緣攝助令起，然其作用非闇所損，定能為因引當眼故。	謂闇中眼或有功能被損害者，便於眼識不能為緣攝助令起，然其作用非闇所損，定能為因引當眼故。	It is said that the eye in darkness, or that which has a damaged function, is not able to act as a condition for visual consciousness and assist in its arising. However, its activity is not damaged by darkness, because it can definitely act as a cause and attract future eyes.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a03_16']	由斯作用、功能有別。	由斯作用、功能有別。	Therefore, activity and function are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a05_4']	然於同類相續果生有定不定，攝引勢力名為作用亦名功能。	然於同類相續果生有定不定，攝引勢力名為作用亦名功能。	However, in the arising of homogeneous and continuous effects, there is a definite or indefinite power of attraction and guidance, which is called activity and also called function.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a06_13']	若於異類相續果生，但能為緣攝助令起，此非作用，但是功能。	若於異類相續果生，但能為緣攝助令起，此非作用，但是功能。	If it produces a result in a different class of homogeneous continuation, it merely serves as a condition to assist its arising. This is not its activity but its power.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a06_18']	豈不論言：	豈不論言：	Isn’t it said in the treatises:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a08_1']	苦法智、忍、光明生相，如是三法皆於未來能起作用。	苦法智、忍、光明生相，如是三法皆於未來能起作用。	The light of the forbearance and knowledge of dharmas in regard to suffering arises in this way. These three dharmas all have activity in the future.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a08_4']	天愛！	天愛！	Oh, our friend!
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a11_15']	汝今執文迷義，我宗釋言此文但約近緣功能假說作用，以於多種法生緣中生是近緣，理極成立，故以餘位因作用名，於此位中假立名想，如是住等隨應當知。	汝今執文迷義，我宗釋言此文但約近緣功能假說作用，以於多種法生緣中生是近緣，理極成立，故以餘位因作用名，於此位中假立名想，如是住等隨應當知。	You now grasp the words and are confused about the meaning. Our school explains that this passage only provisionally establishes activity in terms of the power of a proximate condition. Because it is well established that in the many conditions for the arising of dharmas, this is the proximate condition, therefore the name and concept of activity in the cause in other states is provisionally established in this state. This should be understood in the same way for abiding, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a13_5']	苦忍光明亦於此位有勝功力假立此名，實唯引果方名作用。	苦忍光明亦於此位有勝功力假立此名，實唯引果方名作用。	The light of the forbearance of dharmas in regard to suffering also has superior power in this state and is provisionally given this name. In reality, only that which attracts a result is called activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a13_10']	或有難言：	或有難言：	Or there is an objection:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a14_15']	於正生位若無生等，如何此時生有作用，非住異滅？	於正生位若無生等，如何此時生有作用，非住異滅？	If in the state of just arising there is no arising, etc., how is it that at this time arising has activity but abiding, change, and cessation do not?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a15_13']	於此位中若有生等，如何住等無用唯生？	於此位中若有生等，如何住等無用唯生？	If birth, etc., exist in this state, how can it be said that birth alone is useful and the others are not?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a17_2']	此難不然，且正生位生等非無，住等爾時非現在故功能未有。	此難不然，且正生位生等非無，住等爾時非現在故功能未有。	This objection is not reasonable. In the state of present birth, birth, etc., are not nonexistent. Because the others, abiding, etc., are not present at that time, their functions do not yet exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a19_8']	設此位中未有生等，如汝因果，理亦無違，由汝宗中果將生位，能生因性或有或無，許有隣近展轉因故。	設此位中未有生等，如汝因果，理亦無違，由汝宗中果將生位，能生因性或有或無，許有隣近展轉因故。	Even if these states do not yet have birth, etc., this is not contradictory, because in your system, when the effect is about to arise, the nature of the producing cause may exist or not exist, because you admit that there are proximate and indirect causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a20_8']	又彼經主於四相中許三撥異，作如是說：	又彼經主於四相中許三撥異，作如是說：	Moreover, the author of the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra, among the four characteristics, denies difference and says:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a21_6']	又應一法生已未壞名住，住已壞時名滅。	又應一法生已未壞名住，住已壞時名滅。	Moreover, it should be said that a single dharma, having arisen but not yet destroyed, is called abiding. When it has abided and is about to be destroyed, it is called cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a21_11']	理且可然。	理且可然。	This principle is reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a22_6']	異於一法進退推徵，理不應有。	異於一法進退推徵，理不應有。	Difference, with regard to a single dharma, is not reasonable whether examined in terms of advance or retreat.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a22_11']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a23_13']	異謂前後性相轉變，非即此法可言異此，故說頌言：	異謂前後性相轉變，非即此法可言異此，故說頌言：	Difference means the transformation of the nature and characteristics of what precedes and what follows. It is not possible to say that a dharma is different from itself. Therefore, a verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a24_0']	即前異不成，　　異前非一法，	即前異不成，　　異前非一法，	Difference is not established in what is prior, nor in what is different from what is prior, in a single dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a25_13']	是故於一法，　　立異終不成。	是故於一法，　　立異終不成。	Therefore, in one dharma, positing difference is ultimately not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410a28_10']	且已略成異有別體，剎那相續異並不成，今復各應思擇此義，謂許法外有異相體，由此能令所相一法異而不異。	且已略成異有別體，剎那相續異並不成，今復各應思擇此義，謂許法外有異相體，由此能令所相一法異而不異。	Having already briefly established that difference has a separate substance, difference in momentary continuity is not established. Now, each should consider this meaning. That is to say, it is accepted that apart from dharmas there is the substance of the characteristic of difference, by which the characterized single dharma is different yet not different.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b01_7']	此我應思，不許法外有異相體，而許剎那相續有異，如何外緣雖無差別然得有異？	此我應思，不許法外有異相體，而許剎那相續有異，如何外緣雖無差別然得有異？	This I should consider. Not accepting that apart from dharmas there is the substance of the characteristic of difference, yet accepting that momentary continuity has difference, how can there be difference even though external conditions are without distinction?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b02_11']	經主應思我所應思，於後思擇三世義處，當兼顯了。	經主應思我所應思，於後思擇三世義處，當兼顯了。	The treatise master should consider what I should consider. In the later investigation of the meaning of the three times, it will be clearly revealed.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b03_10']	今於此中正當義便，故略成立用遣所疑。	今於此中正當義便，故略成立用遣所疑。	Now, in this context, it is appropriate to the meaning, and therefore briefly established to dispel doubts.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b06_6']	謂從本來諸法唯有自體安住、差別用無，由遇前生俱生緣力，令差別用本無而起，即此名為現在作用，亦名能引自果功能。	謂從本來諸法唯有自體安住、差別用無，由遇前生俱生緣力，令差別用本無而起，即此名為現在作用，亦名能引自果功能。	That is to say, from the beginningless beginning, dharmas only have their own substance abiding, and the function of distinction is non-existent. Due to the power of the conditions arising before and arising together, it causes the function of distinction to arise where it was originally non-existent. This is called the present function, and is also called the ability to attract one's own effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b06_15']	依此世尊作如是說：	依此世尊作如是說：	On the basis of this, the World Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b07_6']	本無今有，有已還無。	本無今有，有已還無。	What was originally non-existent now exists, and what existed will again become non-existent.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b08_12']	此用與體不可言異，如能益損差別功能與能領受自體不異。	此用與體不可言異，如能益損差別功能與能領受自體不異。	This function and substance cannot be said to be different, just as the ability to benefit or harm and the ability to experience one's own substance are not different.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b10_2']	又如所執，於後心中，前心差別所引習氣，此不可說異於後心。	又如所執，於後心中，前心差別所引習氣，此不可說異於後心。	Moreover, it is like the grasped [grasping] habitual tendencies attracted by the distinctions of the previous mind in the subsequent mind. This cannot be said to be different from the subsequent mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b11_10']	或復如善有見有對造色業性，雖不異色，而彼品類差別義成。	或復如善有見有對造色業性，雖不異色，而彼品類差別義成。	Or, it is like the nature of good, visible, obstructed, and conditioned form, which, although not different from form, still constitutes a category of distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b13_5']	故於此中，諸對法者於法自體、差別用中立有異名，非唯自體謂有為法。	故於此中，諸對法者於法自體、差別用中立有異名，非唯自體謂有為法。	Therefore, in this regard, the Abhidharma masters establish the name of difference in the distinctions of the substance and function of dharmas, not just in the substance itself, referring to conditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b14_10']	於自體中能引自果作用名住，即此作用衰損名異。	於自體中能引自果作用名住，即此作用衰損名異。	The function of attracting its own effect in the substance is called abiding, and the decline of this function is called change.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b15_10']	此住及衰無容自有，應有別法令住令衰。	此住及衰無容自有，應有別法令住令衰。	This abiding and decline cannot exist by themselves, and there must be other dharmas that cause abiding and cause decline.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b15_20']	此二之因，即住異相。	此二之因，即住異相。	The causes of these two are the characteristics of abiding and change.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b16_9']	於斯正理，何不忍歟？	於斯正理，何不忍歟？	Why not accept this correct principle?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b17_16']	我於此中不能忍者，此差別用於現在時，與其自體非異性故。	我於此中不能忍者，此差別用於現在時，與其自體非異性故。	We cannot accept this distinction of function in the present time, because it is not of a different nature from its own substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b18_16']	此用既異，體亦應然，如何乃言用異非體？	此用既異，體亦應然，如何乃言用異非體？	Since this function is different, the substance should also be so. Why do you say that the function is different but not the substance?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b20_4']	若執過去未來體無，於彼所宗可有此失，非許三世恒有體者。	若執過去未來體無，於彼所宗可有此失，非許三世恒有體者。	If one grasps that the substance of the past and future does not exist, one may have this fault in one's tenets, but not one who accepts that the substance of the three times always exists.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b20_9']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b21_12']	若作用息，唯捨現在，法體猶存，云何乃令體亦有異？	若作用息，唯捨現在，法體猶存，云何乃令體亦有異？	If the function ceases, one only abandons the present, and the substance of the dharma still exists. How can one cause the substance to also have a difference?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b21_17']	故說頌言：	故說頌言：	Therefore, a verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b22_0']	自體名有異，　　由勝用衰損，	自體名有異，　　由勝用衰損，	The name of difference in one's own substance is due to the decline of superior function.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b23_5']	如何於一法？	如何於一法？	How can one establish difference in a single dharma?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b23_13']	　　立異終不成。	　　立異終不成。	In the end, it will not be accomplished.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b24_17']	非正生位立有異名，作用爾時未衰損故。	非正生位立有異名，作用爾時未衰損故。	The present state of arising is not called different, because at that time its function has not yet declined.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b25_17']	即由此理，立住異名，此能衰損引果用故。	即由此理，立住異名，此能衰損引果用故。	Precisely because of this principle, abiding is called different, because it can cause the function of attracting results to decline.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b26_10']	由法作用被衰損時方引自果。	由法作用被衰損時方引自果。	When the activity of a dharma is damaged, it attracts its own effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b27_10']	由因被損，後果生位漸劣前因，故果漸劣。	由因被損，後果生位漸劣前因，故果漸劣。	Because the cause is damaged, the effect that arises later is gradually inferior to the previous cause, so the effect gradually becomes inferior.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410b29_4']	由因有異，此果剎那復由俱起異相為緣令衰損故，復能為後果漸劣緣。	由因有異，此果剎那復由俱起異相為緣令衰損故，復能為後果漸劣緣。	Because the cause is different, this effect is also caused by the different characteristics that arise together to be damaged. Therefore, it can also be the cause for the gradual inferiority of the later effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c01_12']	如是一切有為相續，剎那剎那令後後異，故前前念有異義成。	如是一切有為相續，剎那剎那令後後異，故前前念有異義成。	In this way, the continuity of all conditioned dharmas is made different from the later to the later moment by moment, so the meaning of difference of the previous moments is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c03_18']	此義既成，應為比量，謂見最後有差別故，前諸剎那定有差別，非如幻惑譬喻論師所立剎那相續異理。	此義既成，應為比量，謂見最後有差別故，前諸剎那定有差別，非如幻惑譬喻論師所立剎那相續異理。	When this meaning is established, it should be used as an inference. That is to say, because the last [moment] is seen to have a difference, the previous moments definitely have a difference. It is not like the principle of difference in the continuity of moments established by the Vijñānavādin.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c04_19']	若爾，相續漸增長時，異相應無，不見果故。	若爾，相續漸增長時，異相應無，不見果故。	If that is so, when the continuity gradually increases, the difference should not exist, because the effect is not seen.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c06_2']	無斯過失，住相爾時由外緣助勢力增強摧伏異故。	無斯過失，住相爾時由外緣助勢力增強摧伏異故。	There is no such fault, because at that time the characteristic of abiding is assisted by external conditions, and its power becomes stronger, subduing the difference.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c06_7']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c08_8']	諸法作用無有能住過一剎那，是故有為說名有異，非捨自相方得異名，亦非有為有常性過。	諸法作用無有能住過一剎那，是故有為說名有異，非捨自相方得異名，亦非有為有常性過。	The activity of dharmas does not last for more than a single moment. Therefore conditioned dharmas are said to be different. They do not abandon their own characteristics and only then acquire the name of difference. Nor do conditioned dharmas have the fault of having a permanent nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c10_6']	由此法性自體恒然，非作非轉不可改易，故火常用煖為自體，離煖更無火體可得。	由此法性自體恒然，非作非轉不可改易，故火常用煖為自體，離煖更無火體可得。	Because the nature of dharmas is eternally so, not made, not transformed, and cannot be changed. Therefore fire always uses heat as its essence. Apart from heat, there is no fire essence to be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c11_5']	然火作用要藉眾緣，故宗立火為無常性。	然火作用要藉眾緣，故宗立火為無常性。	However, the activity of fire must rely on many conditions. Therefore the school establishes fire as having an impermanent nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c12_4']	若自體異，即成別法，應非無常，體無變故。	若自體異，即成別法，應非無常，體無變故。	If the essence is different, it becomes a separate dharma and should not be impermanent, because its essence does not change.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c13_12']	謂若唯執現在世有、去來體無，則諸行法其性應常，無變異故。	謂若唯執現在世有、去來體無，則諸行法其性應常，無變異故。	That is to say, if one only grasps that the present exists and that the past and future do not exist, then the nature of conditioned dharmas should be permanent, because there is no change.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c13_17']	云何無異？	云何無異？	How can there be no difference?
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c14_11']	謂有與無性各安立，無變異故。	謂有與無性各安立，無變異故。	Because existence and nonexistence each have an established nature without change.
['ZH_T29_1562_014:0410c16_8']	彼唯執有現在世法剎那性故不可變異，未來過去其體並無，無法如何當言變異？	彼唯執有現在世法剎那性故不可變異，未來過去其體並無，無法如何當言變異？	They only hold that dharmas of the present moment exist and are immutable. The substance of future and past dharmas does not exist. How can a nonexistent dharma be said to change?
