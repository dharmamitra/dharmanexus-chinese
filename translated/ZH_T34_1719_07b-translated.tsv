['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281a15_0']	次「遣旁人」者，約教約人，約教則理教相望，	次「遣旁人」者，約教約人，約教則理教相望，	07b	Next, Sending Away the Side Attendants refers to the teachings and the people. In terms of the teachings, it is the mutual comparison of principle and teachings.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281a21_13']	初約教者，理即法身、智即報身，由智故說智為能遣，智雖能遣所依者理，能遣如臣、所依如王，所遣者教故理正教旁，故報望教報亦名正，然報由理成、理親報疎，故二正中從親以說。	初約教者，理即法身、智即報身，由智故說智為能遣，智雖能遣所依者理，能遣如臣、所依如王，所遣者教故理正教旁，故報望教報亦名正，然報由理成、理親報疎，故二正中從親以說。	07b	In the first, in terms of the teachings, the principle corresponds to the Dharma body, and the wisdom corresponds to the reward body. Because of wisdom, wisdom is said to be able to send away. Although wisdom can send away, the basis is the principle. The able sender is like a minister, and the basis is like a king. What is sent away is the teaching, so the principle is correct and the teaching is secondary. Therefore, the reward body is also called correct in comparison with the teaching. However, the reward body is formed by the principle, and the principle is closer to the reward body, so the two correct ones follow the closer one to speak.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281a24_6']	「又旁人者」下約人釋者，〈賢首品〉後〈十住品〉在忉利天，十慧菩薩法慧為首，餘之九慧各以偈讚，次法慧菩薩廣說十住；	「又旁人者」下約人釋者，〈賢首品〉後〈十住品〉在忉利天，十慧菩薩法慧為首，餘之九慧各以偈讚，次法慧菩薩廣說十住；	07b	Moreover, the side attendants and below, the explanation in terms of the people, after the Chapter on the Foremost of Worthies, the Chapter on the Ten Abodes is in the Heaven of the Thirty-three. Ten wise bodhisattvas, with Dharma wisdom as the foremost, the remaining nine wise ones each praise with verses, followed by the bodhisattva Dharma wisdom extensively explaining the ten abodes;
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281a25_18']	次〈夜摩天自在品〉有十林菩薩，九林亦各以偈讚已，功德林廣說十行；	次〈夜摩天自在品〉有十林菩薩，九林亦各以偈讚已，功德林廣說十行；	07b	Next, in the Chapter on the Freedom of the Heaven of Yāma, there are ten forest bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas in nine forests also each praise with verses. Then, the Forest of Merits extensively explains the ten practices.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281a27_10']	次〈升兜率品〉有十幢菩薩，九幢亦各以偈讚已，次金剛幢廣說十向；	次〈升兜率品〉有十幢菩薩，九幢亦各以偈讚已，次金剛幢廣說十向；	07b	Next, in the Chapter on Ascending Tuṣita, there are ten banner bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas in nine banners also each praise with verses. Then, the Diamond Banner extensively explains the ten directions.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b01_9']	次〈升他化品〉有三十六藏菩薩，金剛藏為首，有菩薩名解脫月請說十地，是四菩薩說此位時，並云佛力故說，故名「所遣」。	次〈升他化品〉有三十六藏菩薩，金剛藏為首，有菩薩名解脫月請說十地，是四菩薩說此位時，並云佛力故說，故名「所遣」。	07b	Next, in the Chapter on Ascending the Transformation of Others, there are thirty-six storehouse bodhisattvas, with the Diamond Storehouse as the leader. There is a bodhisattva named Liberation Moon who requests the explanation of the ten grounds. When these four bodhisattvas explain this stage, they all say it is due to the Buddha's power. Therefore, it is called what is sent.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b03_20']	次釋疾走中亦約人教，先約教中但以顯露為疾，「若以菩薩」下重述約人，菩薩自有神通，又被佛加故名為「疾」。	次釋疾走中亦約人教，先約教中但以顯露為疾，「若以菩薩」下重述約人，菩薩自有神通，又被佛加故名為「疾」。	07b	Next, in the explanation of running fast, it is also about people and teachings. First, in the explanation of the teachings, it only takes the revealed as fast. Below If with a bodhisattva, it restates about people. The bodhisattvas themselves have spiritual powers, and they are also empowered by the Buddha, so it is called fast.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b05_13']	「乖心」等者，乖必不識、驚必愕然，如覩不意乖心不識，此教於彼亦復如是。	「乖心」等者，乖必不識、驚必愕然，如覩不意乖心不識，此教於彼亦復如是。	07b	Disagreeable and so forth means that if it is disagreeable, one will definitely not recognize it, and if it is shocking, one will be startled. It is like seeing something unexpected and being disagreeable and not recognizing it. This teaching is also like this for them.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b08_10']	「稱怨大喚」者，《經》但云「怨」而不云「苦」，疏文釋中即以大喚為苦痛，所以具有二義者，逢怨必苦故以大喚擬之，義理合然。	「稱怨大喚」者，《經》但云「怨」而不云「苦」，疏文釋中即以大喚為苦痛，所以具有二義者，逢怨必苦故以大喚擬之，義理合然。	07b	Crying out in resentment - the sutra only says resentment and does not say suffering. The commentary explains it as crying out in pain. The reason it has both meanings is because encountering resentment must be suffering, so crying out is used to refer to it. The meaning of the teaching is like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b10_10']	「若令煩惱即菩提」者，即是令其不斷煩惱，煩惱不斷必招苦報，豈有生死即涅槃耶？	「若令煩惱即菩提」者，即是令其不斷煩惱，煩惱不斷必招苦報，豈有生死即涅槃耶？	07b	If it is said that afflictions are bodhi means that it is said that one should not cut off afflictions. If afflictions are not cut off, one will definitely attract suffering. How can there be samsara that is nirvana?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b11_8']	是故稱怨大喚義當因果，文意兩申。	是故稱怨大喚義當因果，文意兩申。	07b	Therefore, crying out in resentment corresponds to cause and effect. The meaning of the text is explained in two ways.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b13_1']	「自念無罪」等者，自省未能同物入惡起貪欲等，今若為之名為罪行。	「自念無罪」等者，自省未能同物入惡起貪欲等，今若為之名為罪行。	07b	Thinking that one has no faults and so forth means that one reflects on oneself not yet being able to enter evil like others and give rise to greed and so forth. If one were to do it now, it would be called sinful conduct.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b13_17']	菩薩必入生死牢獄，故云「囚執」。	菩薩必入生死牢獄，故云「囚執」。	07b	Bodhisattvas must enter the prison of birth and death, therefore it is said they are imprisoned.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b15_3']	「無大方便」者，無入假智令起貪欲入生死，名「失慧命」。	「無大方便」者，無入假智令起貪欲入生死，名「失慧命」。	07b	Lacking great skillful means means lacking the wisdom of entering the provisional to give rise to craving and enter birth and death, which is called losing the life of wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b16_13']	「必墮」下二釋，墮三途苦則大小咸失，溺無明地，地須義兼界內界外。	「必墮」下二釋，墮三途苦則大小咸失，溺無明地，地須義兼界內界外。	07b	Will certainly fall - the two explanations below, falling into the suffering of the three paths is losing both the small and great, drowning in the ground of ignorance, the ground must be understood as encompassing both within and beyond the realms.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b17_12']	「約人為使者」者，取機之法須同類身。	「約人為使者」者，取機之法須同類身。	07b	Using people as messengers means the method of taking the opportunity must be in a body of the same kind.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b19_2']	「淨名」等者，遣化菩薩往取香飯，彼菩薩見問化菩薩，化菩薩答。	「淨名」等者，遣化菩薩往取香飯，彼菩薩見問化菩薩，化菩薩答。	07b	Vimalakīrti and so forth - sending a transformed bodhisattva to take fragrant food, that bodhisattva sees and asks the transformed bodhisattva, the transformed bodhisattva answers.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b20_11']	以彼菩薩聞說穢土佛及菩薩能此勞謙，彼聞欲來成雙流行。	以彼菩薩聞說穢土佛及菩薩能此勞謙，彼聞欲來成雙流行。	07b	Because that bodhisattva hears of the defiled land, the Buddha and bodhisattvas are able to humble themselves like this, they wish to come upon hearing it, accomplishing the double flow.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b20_16']	彼佛誡曰：	彼佛誡曰：	07b	That Buddha admonishes, saying:
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b21_2']	攝身香等。	攝身香等。	07b	Absorb the fragrance of the body and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b22_17']	彼來於此亦令此土未發心者發心，已發心者修行，故令攝勝從劣現同類也。	彼來於此亦令此土未發心者發心，已發心者修行，故令攝勝從劣現同類也。	07b	They come here to cause those in this land who have not yet given rise to the mind to give rise to the mind, and those who have already given rise to the mind to practice. Therefore, they cause the superior to be included in the inferior and manifest as the same type.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b26_5']	「普賢入此」等者，普賢菩薩身量無邊、音聲無邊、色像無邊，欲來此國，乃以自在神通之力促身令小，閻浮提人三障重故，以智慧力化乘白象。	「普賢入此」等者，普賢菩薩身量無邊、音聲無邊、色像無邊，欲來此國，乃以自在神通之力促身令小，閻浮提人三障重故，以智慧力化乘白象。	07b	Samantabhadra enters this and so forth. The body of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva is boundless, his voice is boundless, and his form is boundless. Wishing to come to this country, he uses the power of sovereign spiritual penetrations to reduce his body to a small size. The people of Jambudvīpa have heavy karmic hindrances, so he uses the power of wisdom to transform and ride a white elephant.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b27_12']	亦為不宜見於勝應者故，菩薩勝報亦不可令二乘見之。	亦為不宜見於勝應者故，菩薩勝報亦不可令二乘見之。	07b	It is also because those who are not suitable to see the superior manifestation should not be allowed to see the bodhisattva's superior reward.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b27_14']	問：	問：	07b	Question:
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b29_3']	若爾，經何不云汝勿令見威德之身，而但云勿彊將來耶？	若爾，經何不云汝勿令見威德之身，而但云勿彊將來耶？	07b	If so, why doesn't the sūtra say you should not allow them to see the majestic body, but only say do not forcibly bring it?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281b29_5']	答：	答：	07b	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c02_6']	身若同類誘之必來，汝身猶勝必令彼懼，故告使言不須彊以勝身化之，故云「勿彊」。	身若同類誘之必來，汝身猶勝必令彼懼，故告使言不須彊以勝身化之，故云「勿彊」。	07b	If the body is the same type, they will definitely come when enticed. Your body is still superior, so you must make them afraid. Therefore, the messenger is told that it is not necessary to transform them with a superior body by force, so it says do not forcibly.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c02_15']	勿彊之言釋成前句。	勿彊之言釋成前句。	07b	Do not use forceful words explains the previous sentence.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c05_15']	「私謂」下此中雖無思惟之言，譬文誡勸並有此語，勸門擬宜云「作是思惟我身手有力」，誡門擬宜云「如所思惟具告諸子」，故私引之。	「私謂」下此中雖無思惟之言，譬文誡勸並有此語，勸門擬宜云「作是思惟我身手有力」，誡門擬宜云「如所思惟具告諸子」，故私引之。	07b	I think - although there are no words of contemplation here, the parable text has admonitions and exhortations with these words. The exhortation is to imagine, saying I have strong arms and hands, the admonition is to imagine, saying tell all the children as you have thought. Therefore, I privately quote it.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c07_3']	須即生善故云不須，即息勸善，彊即誡惡故云勿彊，即息誡惡。	須即生善故云不須，即息勸善，彊即誡惡故云勿彊，即息誡惡。	07b	Because it is necessary to immediately give rise to goodness, it is said not to be necessary, which immediately stops exhorting goodness. Do not use forceful words means that because it is forceful to admonish evil, it immediately stops admonishing evil.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c08_19']	「宜以」至「如面也」者，觀其秖宜聞生滅教，取灰斷理說有理之教，故云「理水」。	「宜以」至「如面也」者，觀其秖宜聞生滅教，取灰斷理說有理之教，故云「理水」。	07b	It is appropriate to use to like a face means that observing that they are only suitable to hear the teaching of arising and ceasing, and accept the principle of annihilation, the teaching that speaks of the principle is called the water of principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c10_11']	「面」者以向釋之，有背生死向涅槃機，故名為面，非謂灑彼涅槃名面。	「面」者以向釋之，有背生死向涅槃機，故名為面，非謂灑彼涅槃名面。	07b	Face is explained as facing, having the potential to turn away from birth and death and face nirvana, therefore it is called a face, it does not mean that sprinkling nirvana is called a face.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c11_2']	「莫復與語」語秖是教。	「莫復與語」語秖是教。	07b	Do not speak with them again - speak is just the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c13_11']	「不語他人」至「菩薩也」者，此中一往但云昔小，然法華前諸大乘經不說二乘是菩薩者，將護二乘豈關菩薩。	「不語他人」至「菩薩也」者，此中一往但云昔小，然法華前諸大乘經不說二乘是菩薩者，將護二乘豈關菩薩。	07b	Not speaking to others up to bodhisattva - here it is said that in the past it was only small, but before the Lotus Sutra, the Mahayana sutras did not say that the two vehicles are bodhisattvas. Protecting the two vehicles, how is it related to bodhisattvas?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c14_5']	覆實護權故云「覆護」。	覆實護權故云「覆護」。	07b	Concealing the truth and protecting the provisional is called covering and protecting.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c16_5']	亦是覆陰將護不彰其實，故法華前一實之外皆名隨他，且隱四味之言，通云小乘教耳。	亦是覆陰將護不彰其實，故法華前一實之外皆名隨他，且隱四味之言，通云小乘教耳。	07b	It is also covering and sheltering, protecting without revealing the truth. Therefore, before the Lotus Sutra, everything outside of the one truth is called following others, and the words of the four flavors are hidden. It is simply called the teaching of the Small Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c18_13']	以昔二味猶有小教、定無小乘作佛之語，故乳及二酥並對小機云不說耳，乃由彈斥加說得二味名。	以昔二味猶有小教、定無小乘作佛之語，故乳及二酥並對小機云不說耳，乃由彈斥加說得二味名。	07b	Because in the past two flavors there was still the teaching of the Small Vehicle, but there was definitely no talk of the Small Vehicle becoming a Buddha. Therefore, milk and the two kinds of cream are all called not spoken in response to the Small Vehicle. It is because of the reprimanding and adding of the teaching that the two flavors are given their names.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c21_12']	「即是息化」至「從地而起」者，此中二釋，兩地不同、二起無別，故息一大化離二種地，讚大墜苦故有前釋，用小取得故有次釋。	「即是息化」至「從地而起」者，此中二釋，兩地不同、二起無別，故息一大化離二種地，讚大墜苦故有前釋，用小取得故有次釋。	07b	This is the end of the transformation to rising from the ground - there are two explanations here, with two different grounds and two risings without distinction, therefore ending one great transformation and leaving two kinds of grounds, praising the great and falling into suffering is the first explanation, using the small to obtain is the second explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c24_5']	次釋中云「無明地」者，若云「臥地」則譬二無明，若言「而起」，則且從界內，故知不解大小具二無明並名為「臥」。	次釋中云「無明地」者，若云「臥地」則譬二無明，若言「而起」，則且從界內，故知不解大小具二無明並名為「臥」。	07b	In the next explanation, the ground of ignorance - if it is said lying on the ground, then it is a metaphor for the two kinds of ignorance, if it is said rising, then it is just from within the realm, therefore it is known that not understanding the great and small is called lying.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c24_21']	今逗小法先治界內，故且云「起」。	今逗小法先治界內，故且云「起」。	07b	Now, in accordance with the small teaching, first treating within the realm, therefore it is said rising.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c27_5']	「於四諦中」至「衣食」者，宜趣所對之境故云「往至」，小仍在機故以欲釋求，下句方云「長者將欲」故也。	「於四諦中」至「衣食」者，宜趣所對之境故云「往至」，小仍在機故以欲釋求，下句方云「長者將欲」故也。	07b	Within the four truths to clothing and food - it is appropriate to go to the objects that are opposed, therefore it is said going to, the small is still in the opportunity, therefore using desire to explain seeking, the next sentence then says the elder is about to, therefore.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0281c28_10']	境攝法狹故云「貧里」，欲趣小果還須正助故云「衣食」。	境攝法狹故云「貧里」，欲趣小果還須正助故云「衣食」。	07b	The realm subsumes the Dharma, so it is called poor village. If one wishes to attain the small fruit, one still needs the correct and auxiliary [teachings], so it is called clothing and food.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a01_19']	「又以他日」下「取意領法身地」者，言中且云「在道樹前」，意則俱指漸頓教前，以云「致難尊特」，故知通至頓前。	「又以他日」下「取意領法身地」者，言中且云「在道樹前」，意則俱指漸頓教前，以云「致難尊特」，故知通至頓前。	07b	And on another day below, taking the meaning to lead to the ground of the Dharma body - the words merely say in front of the bodhi tree, but the meaning refers to both the gradual and sudden teachings, because it says to present difficulties to the majestic and special [body]. Therefore, it is known that [the meaning] extends to the front of the sudden [teaching].
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a03_17']	「問四大弟子」等者，答中意者，既聞譬已，具領二周、入大不虛，故自推云「若始」等也。	「問四大弟子」等者，答中意者，既聞譬已，具領二周、入大不虛，故自推云「若始」等也。	07b	The four great disciples ask... The meaning of the answer is that, having already heard the parables, they fully understand the two periods and enter the great without falsehood, so they infer themselves and say if it begins... and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a05_3']	納法既重必有此知，約化儀說從容進退，故先齊後探耳。	納法既重必有此知，約化儀說從容進退，故先齊後探耳。	07b	Since the acceptance of the Dharma is heavy, there must be this understanding. Speaking from the perspective of the ritual of transformation, one can advance or retreat as appropriate, so first equal and then explore.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a09_15']	豈有自獲小來方五十載，具覩菩薩難思境界，遍聞諸法一切融通，非全不知，然未測本源省己絕分，今蒙法譬分染圓常，推知如來往日先照，故下佛歎甚為希有，故以二味所覩驗先見非真。	豈有自獲小來方五十載，具覩菩薩難思境界，遍聞諸法一切融通，非全不知，然未測本源省己絕分，今蒙法譬分染圓常，推知如來往日先照，故下佛歎甚為希有，故以二味所覩驗先見非真。	07b	How could it be that I have attained it myself for fifty years, fully witnessed the inconceivable realm of the bodhisattvas, and heard all dharmas completely merging, not knowing it completely, but still not measuring the original source and considering myself to have no share? Now I have received the division of the dharmic analogy, tainted with the perfect and eternal, and infer that the Tathāgata's previous illumination, therefore the Buddha's praise below is very rare, therefore using the two flavors to verify that the previous view is not true.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a11_12']	「脫大小相」者，相為大相海、好為小相海，全隱無量相好海身，故譬云「脫」。	「脫大小相」者，相為大相海、好為小相海，全隱無量相好海身，故譬云「脫」。	07b	Removing the major and minor marks means that the major marks are the ocean of major marks, and the excellent characteristics are the ocean of minor marks. Completely concealing the body of the ocean of immeasurable major and minor marks, therefore the analogy says removing.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a12_1']	相好難量喻之於海。	相好難量喻之於海。	07b	The major and minor marks are difficult to measure, comparing them to an ocean.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a13_4']	「密遣二人」者，於中先釋二人，次「初擬」下方釋密遣。	「密遣二人」者，於中先釋二人，次「初擬」下方釋密遣。	07b	Secretly dispatching two people - in this, first explaining the two people, next below first intending explaining the secret dispatch.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a13_14']	人是所遣，密是遣意。	人是所遣，密是遣意。	07b	People are those who are sent, secret is the intention of sending.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a14_13']	初文先明但二之意，故對菩薩且通指二人。	初文先明但二之意，故對菩薩且通指二人。	07b	The first text first clarifies the meaning of only two, therefore generally pointing to the two people in contrast to the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a15_8']	次「約法」下約法約人以分二也。	次「約法」下約法約人以分二也。	07b	Next, under in terms of the Dharma, it divides into two based on the Dharma and the person.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a16_13']	次釋密遣者，先對旁人以辯異，即之與密顯覆異耳。	次釋密遣者，先對旁人以辯異，即之與密顯覆異耳。	07b	Next, in explaining the secret dispatch, first distinguishing it from the side person, the secret and dispatch reveal the difference in concealment.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0282a18_9']	今明密遣者，覆實名密、用小為遣，覆滿明半準例可知，即是分字解也。	今明密遣者，覆實名密、用小為遣，覆滿明半準例可知，即是分字解也。	07b	Now, in explaining the secret dispatch, concealing the truth is called secret, using the small as the dispatch. Concealing the full reveals the half, which can be understood by analogy, which is the analysis of the characters.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0283a18_14']	今亦如是，非中故偏、不遍故狹，故法身地觀無大機，唯見偏狹先熟故也。	今亦如是，非中故偏、不遍故狹，故法身地觀無大機，唯見偏狹先熟故也。	07b	Now it is also like this. Because it is not in the middle, it is biased, and because it is not universal, it is narrow. Therefore, on the ground of the Dharma body, the view is not for those with great capacity, but only for those who are ripe first and who see it as biased and narrow.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0283a19_14']	乃由子隔窓牖之外，何關長者偏視之非？	乃由子隔窓牖之外，何關長者偏視之非？	07b	It is because the children are separated from the window and the window, how is it the fault of the elder's biased vision?

Forbearing the harm of sentient beings is called the forbearance of sentient beings, and forbearing the harm of non-sentient beings is called the forbearance of dharmas.

The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra lists ten afflictions of the Buddha: six years of ascetic practice, slander by Sundarī, golden spurs, barley gruel, Rāhula killing Śākyas, begging for food with an empty bowl, slander by the woman Candalī, Devadatta pushing a mountain, cold wind asking for clothes, and back pain at the twin trees.

The seven factors of enlightenment are before the eightfold path. The *Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra has a detailed analysis, briefly like the seventh record of the Śamathavipaśyanā.

Therefore, it is explained from the correct cultivation of mindfulness. Although it is said that the stages must be combined with the arising of characteristics, only then can this be explained. Therefore, the text below says diligently cultivating mindfulness and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0283b09_12']	「生空如來」等者，此教作法所有生法不涉大乘，即《阿含》中是老死誰老死，故生法二空並屬正道，具如《止觀》第三記。	「生空如來」等者，此教作法所有生法不涉大乘，即《阿含》中是老死誰老死，故生法二空並屬正道，具如《止觀》第三記。	07b	As for the emptiness of beings and the Tathāgata, the methods in this teaching do not involve the Mahāyāna, but are from the Āgamas. It is like asking who is old and dying? Therefore, the emptiness of beings and phenomena both belong to the correct path, as fully explained in the third record of the Śamathavipaśyanā.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0283b12_7']	「無常等為助」者，若諦觀中云無常者，乃是正觀，今以二空望於事中對治無常，但得名助，況復更以一期念念以之為助？	「無常等為助」者，若諦觀中云無常者，乃是正觀，今以二空望於事中對治無常，但得名助，況復更以一期念念以之為助？	07b	As for impermanence and so forth being aids, if it is said impermanent in the contemplation of the truths, this is the correct contemplation. Now, from the perspective of the two kinds of emptiness, in the counteraction of impermanence in phenomena, it is only called an aid. Moreover, using the entire life and moment by moment as aids?

Out of the thirty-two, in twenty weeks the aspects are reduced, in seven weeks the objects are reduced, until finally only one aspect remains, contemplating a single moment entering the supreme worldly dharmas. It is briefly like the Profound Meaning and the Brief Commentary on the Treatise, which briefly quote the text of the Abhidharma-kośa.

The treatise says composed by Kātyāyanīputra based on the treatise that was composed and the one who conceived of it. How can it be that by reconciling the two one returns to the Agamas?

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0283b28_10']	若準《大論》，至初果已名之為死，不任復發。	若準《大論》，至初果已名之為死，不任復發。	07b	If based on the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra, having reached the first fruit is called death, and one is no longer able to give rise [to the bodhisattva path].

The first one combines the numbers to make twenty, and the next six explanations only establish two names, such as taking the elimination of views as one and the elimination of thoughts as one.

The eight forbearances are used to suppress [afflictions], and the eight knowledges are used to eliminate [afflictions]. In the path of cultivation, the nine [forbearances] and the nine [knowledges] are used together to make eighteen.

Among the five upper parts, form-realm afflictions and formless-realm afflictions are only upper. Although agitation, pride, etc. are also lower, they cannot pull one down, so they are called upper parts.

Anger is only in the lower [realms] and does not extend to the upper [realms]. The other three completely encompass all the views of the upper [realms].

Because of the three, one returns to the lower [realms]. Even if one severs craving and so forth up to the sphere of nothingness, due to the view of self and so forth, one returns to the desire realm. It is explained in detail in the *Abhidharma-kośa.

The first two lines from Shariputra, you should know, I see the Buddha's disciples... show the great beings in motion, which is the basis for the parable of seeking the carriage now.

Those who wish to discuss it further should describe the great principles. The flavors are divided simultaneously, but the schools differ. In terms of principle, the names are different, but they all return to permanence. In terms of capacity, they are called gleaning. In terms of the Dharma, they preserve the three provisional teachings. In terms of intention, they carry the precepts. In terms of realization, they include the small fruits. In terms of benefiting, they have no extensive records. The length of time of the teachings is eternally different. The discussion of permanence in the past and future is not the same. The parables are about the remaining forces of the great army. The auspicious signs and expressions are different. The difficulty of breaking attachments is not the same. The understanding of the near and far traces is different. The accomplishment of the faculties is not equal. The treatment of birth and death is not the same. The entrustment has the lower and this.

However, the child's essence is compared to the father's greatness, and the father's essence is compared to the child's smallness without contradiction. From beginning to end, it is said that the child has not yet realized the father, so when seeing the majestic body, one sees it but does not accept it. Since it is so for seeing the body, the other examples can be understood.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0284b28_9']	「由此見尊特身」者，如《淨名》中「譬如須彌山王顯于大海，安處眾寶師子之座，蔽於一切諸來大眾」，《藥師》中「巍巍堂堂如星中之月」，《大集》中「集二界中間」，諸方等經是例非一，乃至聞說大法見大神通，覩大菩薩難思大事等，皆由已得阿羅漢果，斥奪不疑故云「由此」。	「由此見尊特身」者，如《淨名》中「譬如須彌山王顯于大海，安處眾寶師子之座，蔽於一切諸來大眾」，《藥師》中「巍巍堂堂如星中之月」，《大集》中「集二界中間」，諸方等經是例非一，乃至聞說大法見大神通，覩大菩薩難思大事等，皆由已得阿羅漢果，斥奪不疑故云「由此」。	07b	For this reason, one sees the majestic body means that in the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, it is said, It is like Mount Sumeru, which appears in the great ocean. Sitting on the lion throne adorned with various treasures, it outshines the entire great assembly that has come. In the Bhaiṣajya Sūtra, it says, Majestic and resplendent like the moon among the stars. In the Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra, it says, Gathering in the middle of the two realms. There are many such examples in the vaipulya sūtras. Even hearing the teaching of the great Dharma and seeing the great spiritual powers, witnessing the great bodhisattvas' inconceivable great matters, etc., are all due to having already attained the fruit of arhatship, and there is no doubt in rejecting and denying it, so it is said for this reason.

Discussing the expounding teachings must be complete with the four. Gold is just following the principle, therefore it is said that it does not go beyond these two. In addition, many of the two vehicles have become common and separate by this time, so it is also said.

There are three of these. The first one is the main meaning in prajñā. The next one is based on principle. At the time of prajñā, it secretly clarifies non-duality, but the two vehicles do not know it. It is said that the intention is common in the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0284c14_3']	第三就今意者，於佛即是付財，二乘自謂加說，故《般若》中云「豈聲聞人敢有所說？	第三就今意者，於佛即是付財，二乘自謂加說，故《般若》中云「豈聲聞人敢有所說？	07b	The third is based on the present meaning. For the Buddha, it is entrusting the wealth. The two vehicles themselves say it is added. Therefore, the Prajñā[pāramitā Sūtra] says, How dare the śrāvakas speak anything?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0284c14_12']	有所說者皆是佛力。	有所說者皆是佛力。	07b	Anything that is spoken is all the Buddha's power.

It is manifested in the bodhisattvas and secretly covers the two vehicles. However, the four periods above all have two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0284c18_11']	一述佛化意，二已納密機，是則我身領佛二義，是故名「領」。	一述佛化意，二已納密機，是則我身領佛二義，是故名「領」。	07b	First, recounting the Buddha's intention for his teachings, second, the secret opportunity has already been accepted.

Since prajñā is not one, the time in between is long, and it is generally called a short time, looking forward to the later urging. In each time and assembly, there is thinking and consideration.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0284c24_18']	「失不失」者，失則於己無分，不失復未同菩薩，踟蹰之際即機欲發時，正發乃在三請時也。	「失不失」者，失則於己無分，不失復未同菩薩，踟蹰之際即機欲發時，正發乃在三請時也。	07b	Lost and not lost means that if lost, one has no share in oneself, and if not lost, one still does not share equally with the bodhisattvas. The juncture of hesitation is precisely the time when the opportunity is about to arise, and the correct arising is at the time of the three requests.

Since it is the end of the four flavors, it is called gradual and already. Since there are no differences in capacities, it is called pervading and unobstructed.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0284c28_5']	發在須臾故名為「即」。	發在須臾故名為「即」。	07b	It arises in a moment, therefore it is called immediately.

Wealth is what is earned, and teaching is what is created. They are all the teaching activities of the bodhisattvas' cultivation of the three causes.

The borders are wide and narrow, the people are more or less, the resources are different, and what is produced is not the same.

From above the first and below, first the previous three meanings are raised. Beside and chasing are the two meanings in the exhortation. Again chasing are the two meanings in the warning gate. Letting go is the cessation of the transformation in the two gates.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286a22_4']	言「三苦」者，由三苦故五濁加重，所以二門並無大機但堪小化。	言「三苦」者，由三苦故五濁加重，所以二門並無大機但堪小化。	07b	As for the three sufferings, it is because of the three sufferings that the five turbidities become heavier. Therefore, there is no great response in the two gates, but only the small transformation is suitable.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286a23_3']	五濁逼故即是三苦，無明覆故即是無知。	五濁逼故即是三苦，無明覆故即是無知。	07b	Because of the oppression of the five turbidities, it is the three sufferings. Because of the covering of ignorance, it is the lack of knowledge.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286a23_11']	「今合」下正合。	「今合」下正合。	07b	Now combined and below is the correct combination.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286a24_17']	「二門無機」者，「何為見捉」即勸門無機，「自念無罪」即誡門無機。	「二門無機」者，「何為見捉」即勸門無機，「自念無罪」即誡門無機。	07b	No response in the two gates means why am I caught? which is the lack of response in the exhortation gate. Thinking of myself as innocent is the lack of response in the warning gate.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286a25_13']	不云二門擬宜者，即以二門無機兼之。	不云二門擬宜者，即以二門無機兼之。	07b	It does not say that the two gates are expedient means, but the lack of response in the two gates includes it.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286b04_17']	是則但合初文第二，即攝下三及初第一，故上文正放捨云「我今放汝隨意所趣」，已知有小志，故於大放捨。	是則但合初文第二，即攝下三及初第一，故上文正放捨云「我今放汝隨意所趣」，已知有小志，故於大放捨。	07b	This then only agrees with the second part of the first part, and includes the following three and the first first part, so the above text says to release and abandon, I now release you to go wherever you wish. Since it is already known that there is a lesser aspiration, therefore, in the great release and abandonment.

The manifestation of the superior response body is not the originally existent Dharma body. Further operating dependent on the emptiness of compassion, therefore it is called building.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286b22_10']	《經》云「頓止一城」者，「頓」謂頓乏，示迹之相義同於之。	《經》云「頓止一城」者，「頓」謂頓乏，示迹之相義同於之。	07b	The sutra says suddenly stopping in a city. Suddenly means suddenly exhausted. The appearance of showing traces is the same as that.

The suffering of loss and the joy of gain are both in the father's mind. Therefore, at the time of loss, he already harbors joy, knowing that the son will definitely return later.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286c06_17']	「法身是師是王」等者，此文合在次文畏避段中，若準上文秖應法身如王，加著「師」者重加一譬耳。	「法身是師是王」等者，此文合在次文畏避段中，若準上文秖應法身如王，加著「師」者重加一譬耳。	07b	The Dharma body is the teacher, the king, and so on and so on, this passage should be in the section on fear and avoidance next, if according to the above text it should only be that the Dharma body is like the king, adding teacher is just adding another analogy.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286c08_6']	「報應是長者」者，秖應云報如王等，兼語應身者，報是勝應故也。	「報應是長者」者，秖應云報如王等，兼語應身者，報是勝應故也。	07b	The reward and response are the elder and so on, it should only be said that the reward is like the king and so on, speaking of the response body together is because the reward is the superior response.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286c13_2']	「授決」者，《華嚴》前文無授記語，〈入法界品〉旁論授記，亦得名為授記故也。	「授決」者，《華嚴》前文無授記語，〈入法界品〉旁論授記，亦得名為授記故也。	07b	Receiving predictions means that the previous text of the Flower Ornament Sutra does not have the words bestowing predictions, but the chapter on entering the Dharma realm discusses bestowing predictions, which can also be called bestowing predictions.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286c13_15']	「弘誓及行」者，彼最委悉。	「弘誓及行」者，彼最委悉。	07b	Vast vows and practices means that they are the most detailed.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286c18_11']	「上旁人追文有三」者，初喚為勸門二義，次喚為誡門二義，次「是人」下第三二行頌無機，即放捨。	「上旁人追文有三」者，初喚為勸門二義，次喚為誡門二義，次「是人」下第三二行頌無機，即放捨。	07b	The three in the upper text, the side person chasing the text means first calling it the two meanings of the exhortation gate, next calling it the two meanings of the admonition gate, and next, under this person, the third two lines of verse have no capacity, so they are abandoned.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286c19_18']	無機者，重牒二門無機，以無機故方乃息化，故云釋放捨也。	無機者，重牒二門無機，以無機故方乃息化，故云釋放捨也。	07b	Having no capacity means reiterating the two gates without capacity, and because of having no capacity, the transformation is then stopped, so it is said to explain the abandonment.

The meaning of the text of the teaching of the same vehicle is from the Way of Enlightenment, taking the meaning of attracting the small capacity as turning the wheel. The meaning of the text of probing the understanding of the same vehicle is that at the time of the Dharma body ground, there is no time when [the Buddha] does not have compassion, how could he not teach? How could he wait to turn the wheel?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0286c23_16']	故云教作。	故云教作。	07b	Therefore it is said teaching.

Knowing that I enjoy the small combines with the father and son seeing each other.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a10_8']	樂小由退大所以相失，退大由樂小所以相見，故二句相成攝八句也。	樂小由退大所以相失，退大由樂小所以相見，故二句相成攝八句也。	07b	Enjoying the small is due to turning away from the great, which is why they lose each other. Turning away from the great is due to enjoying the small, which is why they see each other. Therefore, the two phrases complement each other and encompass the eight phrases.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a17_11']	言「委業」者，委即是命。	言「委業」者，委即是命。	07b	As for entrusting the affairs, entrusting is the same as commanding.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a19_5']	「今初一行長頌受命領知上頌所無」者，上頌譬中全無命知，但有受命中三耳。	「今初一行長頌受命領知上頌所無」者，上頌譬中全無命知，但有受命中三耳。	07b	The first line of the long verse accepts the command and understands what was not in the above verse - in the above verse, the parable is completely without commanding to understand, but only has the three in the acceptance of the command.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a21_1']	「初一行標斷德」者，以云內滅，內即惑體，三界惑盡故云內滅，故屬斷德也。	「初一行標斷德」者，以云內滅，內即惑體，三界惑盡故云內滅，故屬斷德也。	07b	The first line indicates the virtue of cessation means that since it says internal extinction, internal refers to the substance of afflictions. Since the afflictions of the three realms are exhausted, it is called internal extinction, and therefore it belongs to the virtue of cessation.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a22_2']	「次標智德」者，既云若聞，聞教屬智，故云智德。	「次標智德」者，既云若聞，聞教屬智，故云智德。	07b	Next, it indicates the virtue of wisdom means that since it says if one hears, hearing the teaching belongs to wisdom, and therefore it is called the virtue of wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a23_2']	以小智具故不欣大智，此二並舉失顯過。	以小智具故不欣大智，此二並舉失顯過。	07b	Because of possessing small wisdom, one does not delight in great wisdom. These two both raise the loss to reveal the fault.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a27_7']	次「所以者何下六行雙釋智斷」者，初二行釋斷，次一行半釋智，次一行半重釋斷，次一行重釋智，故知初二行明自住小斷，次一行半明失大智，次一行半重釋小斷，次一行釋失大智。	次「所以者何下六行雙釋智斷」者，初二行釋斷，次一行半釋智，次一行半重釋斷，次一行重釋智，故知初二行明自住小斷，次一行半明失大智，次一行半重釋小斷，次一行釋失大智。	07b	Next, the six lines below 'Why is it so?' both explain wisdom and cessation means that the first two lines explain cessation, the next one and a half lines explain wisdom, the next one and a half lines explain cessation again, and the next line explains wisdom again. Therefore, it is known that the first two lines clarify abiding in the small cessation oneself, the next one and a half lines clarify the loss of great wisdom, the next one and a half lines explain the small cessation again, and the next line explains the loss of great wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287a28_13']	「分得大乘習果也」者，得初住時破一品無明名為習果。	「分得大乘習果也」者，得初住時破一品無明名為習果。	07b	It is the fruit of practice obtained by partially attaining the Great Vehicle means that when one attains the first stage of abiding, one breaks through one level of ignorance, which is called the fruit of practice.

['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b05_13']	初室有三恩，初一是通遍被之恩，次二是別拔與之恩，通被是四弘之始，別被是填願中終，則發心後起行之來，自成道前處處蒙益，蒙益之相不出與拔，與拔之澤知何可報。	初室有三恩，初一是通遍被之恩，次二是別拔與之恩，通被是四弘之始，別被是填願中終，則發心後起行之來，自成道前處處蒙益，蒙益之相不出與拔，與拔之澤知何可報。	07b	First, the room has three kinds of kindness. The first is the kindness of universal coverage, and the next two are the kindness of specific rescue and bestowal. Universal coverage is the beginning of the four universal vows, and specific coverage is the end of fulfilling the vows. Then, after arousing the mind and engaging in practice, before attaining enlightenment, one is benefited everywhere. The characteristics of being benefited do not go beyond rescue and bestowal, and the grace of rescue and bestowal is difficult to repay.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b07_12']	所以難報者，初以自行之真令我修習，自稟教後退大輪迴，慈悲不離處處與拔。	所以難報者，初以自行之真令我修習，自稟教後退大輪迴，慈悲不離處處與拔。	07b	The reason it is difficult to repay is that first, with the truth of one's own practice, one allows me to cultivate. After receiving the teaching, one may regress and revolve in the great wheel, but compassion never departs, and everywhere one rescues and bestows.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b13_2']	次衣恩有四者，我受教已大小並忘，處處調停知我機遂，即於此界頓漸道成，雖先正為大機，兼亦憂我善種，故於頓後便垂小化，彈斥淘汰鎚砧鍛鍊，貶之以貧事草庵，誘之以富豪家業，宿萌稍剖尚未敷榮，長遠之恩何由可報？	次衣恩有四者，我受教已大小並忘，處處調停知我機遂，即於此界頓漸道成，雖先正為大機，兼亦憂我善種，故於頓後便垂小化，彈斥淘汰鎚砧鍛鍊，貶之以貧事草庵，誘之以富豪家業，宿萌稍剖尚未敷榮，長遠之恩何由可報？	07b	Next, the four kinds of kindness of the Dharma robe: I received the teachings but forgot both the large and small, adjusting everywhere and knowing that my faculties were fulfilled, then in this realm the gradual and sudden paths were accomplished. Although I was originally corrected for the great faculties, I was also worried about my good seeds. Therefore, after the sudden teaching, I immediately manifested the small teaching, reprimanding and refining like a hammer and anvil, disparaging me with poverty and a grass hut, enticing me with the wealth and family business of the rich and powerful. The latent sprouts slightly opened but were not yet flourishing. How could I repay the kindness of the long-distant path?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b13_16']	是故四中初以人天，次及三味。	是故四中初以人天，次及三味。	07b	Therefore, among the four, the first is the kindness of the human and heavenly realms, and the next is the three flavors.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b15_15']	如來座恩有三者，至法華時始獲妙益，兼能利物，化道初成，難報之恩良有以也。	如來座恩有三者，至法華時始獲妙益，兼能利物，化道初成，難報之恩良有以也。	07b	The kindness of the Tathāgata's seat has three: At the time of the Lotus Sūtra, I finally attained wonderful benefits and was able to benefit others. The initial accomplishment of the teaching of transformation is a kindness that is difficult to repay, and there is a reason for this.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b16_14']	所以第八是授記恩，九十令我能利物恩。	所以第八是授記恩，九十令我能利物恩。	07b	Therefore, the eighth is the kindness of granting predictions, and the ninth and tenth are the kindness of enabling me to benefit others.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b20_1']	所以室得衣故有覆育之恩，室有座故成與拔之用，座假衣室令自他行成，衣假座室令初後理顯，是故三義合成大恩，此始終恩將何以報？	所以室得衣故有覆育之恩，室有座故成與拔之用，座假衣室令自他行成，衣假座室令初後理顯，是故三義合成大恩，此始終恩將何以報？	07b	Therefore, since the room has clothing, there is the grace of covering and nurturing; since the room has a seat, it accomplishes the function of pulling out [beings from suffering]. The seat relies on clothing and the room to make one's own practice and that of others be accomplished. The clothing relies on the seat and room to make the principle of the beginning and end be revealed. Therefore, the three meanings combine to form a great grace. How can this beginning and end grace be repaid?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b21_9']	注家但云物不答施於天地，子不謝生於父母，以感報斯亡。	注家但云物不答施於天地，子不謝生於父母，以感報斯亡。	07b	The annotator only says that things do not repay the bestowal of heaven and earth, and children do not thank their parents for giving birth, so that the response is lost.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b22_7']	今意正論荷恩難報，何得以亡報釋之？	今意正論荷恩難報，何得以亡報釋之？	07b	Now the meaning is precisely discussing the difficulty of repaying the grace that is borne. How can it be explained as lost repayment?
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b23_13']	況復秖緣令我報亡，斯恩叵報，故不得直以亡報釋之。	況復秖緣令我報亡，斯恩叵報，故不得直以亡報釋之。	07b	Moreover, it is precisely because it makes my repayment lost that this grace is difficult to repay, so one cannot directly explain it as lost repayment.
['ZH_T34_1719_07b:0287b25_5']	凡言亡者，治彼不亡，今非領亡但領難報，二時既別且釋荷恩。	凡言亡者，治彼不亡，今非領亡但領難報，二時既別且釋荷恩。	07b	As for the term lost, it is used to govern that which is not lost. Now it is not receiving the lost but receiving the difficult to repay. Since the two times are different, let us first explain the grace that is borne.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
