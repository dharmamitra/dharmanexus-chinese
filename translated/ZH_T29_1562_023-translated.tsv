['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b01_1']	於死有後、在生有前，即彼中間有自體起，為至生處故起此身，二有中間故名中有。	於死有後、在生有前，即彼中間有自體起，為至生處故起此身，二有中間故名中有。	After death existence and before birth existence, in the middle there arises its own body, in order to reach the place of birth it gives rise to this body, because it is between the two existences it is called intermediate existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b01_15']	如何此有，體有起歿而不名生？	如何此有，體有起歿而不名生？	How is it that this existence has arising and perishing but is not called birth?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b02_11']	又此有身，為從業得、為自體有？	又此有身，為從業得、為自體有？	Also, does this bodily existence come from karma or does it exist by itself?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b03_9']	從業得者，此應名生，業為生因，契經說故。	從業得者，此應名生，業為生因，契經說故。	That which is obtained from action should be called birth, because action is the cause of birth, as the scriptures say.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b04_7']	自體有者，此應無因，則同無因外道論失。	自體有者，此應無因，則同無因外道論失。	That which exists by itself should have no cause, and then one would fall into the error of the non-Buddhist doctrine of causelessness.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b04_16']	是故中有應即名生。	是故中有應即名生。	Therefore the intermediate existence should be called birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b05_15']	生謂當來所應至處，依所至義建立生名。	生謂當來所應至處，依所至義建立生名。	Birth means the place to which one should go in the future. The name birth is established based on the meaning of arriving at that place.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b06_15']	此中有身體雖起歿，而未至彼，故不名生。	此中有身體雖起歿，而未至彼，故不名生。	Although the body of this intermediate existence arises and perishes, it has not yet arrived there, so it is not called birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b08_3']	體謂此中異熟五蘊，此但名起，不說為生，死生有中暫時起故。	體謂此中異熟五蘊，此但名起，不說為生，死生有中暫時起故。	The body refers to the five aggregates of karmic maturation in this intermediate existence. It is only called arising, not birth, because it arises temporarily in the intermediate existence between death and birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b09_3']	或復生者是所起義，中有能起，所以非生。	或復生者是所起義，中有能起，所以非生。	Or, birth means that which is to be produced. The intermediate existence is able to produce, so it is not birth.

['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b10_3']	謂業所引異熟五蘊究竟分明。	謂業所引異熟五蘊究竟分明。	It refers to the five aggregates of karmic maturation that are finally manifested and clearly distinguished by karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b11_19']	以業為生因，契經說故，此應名生者，其理不然，不說業為因皆名為生，故契經說：	以業為生因，契經說故，此應名生者，其理不然，不說業為因皆名為生，故契經說：	Because karma is said to be the cause of birth in the scriptures, it should be called birth. This reasoning is not correct, because not all that is said to be the cause of karma is called birth. Therefore the scriptures say:
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b13_1']	有補特伽羅，已斷起結、未斷生結，廣說四句。	有補特伽羅，已斷起結、未斷生結，廣說四句。	There are sentient beings who have already eliminated the fetters of rebirth but have not yet eliminated the fetters of birth. The four alternatives are explained in detail.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b14_14']	由是准知，有順中有非生有業，此業所得不說為生，故與彼經無相違過。	由是准知，有順中有非生有業，此業所得不說為生，故與彼經無相違過。	By this we know that there are karmas that lead to rebirth in the intermediate state but not to rebirth in the next life. The results obtained by this karma are not called rebirth. Therefore, there is no contradiction with that sutra.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b15_13']	此既與生同一業引，如何中有名起非生？	此既與生同一業引，如何中有名起非生？	Since this is led by the same karma as rebirth, how can the intermediate state be called arising but not rebirth?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b16_12']	豈不前說，所至所趣乃說為生，中有不爾。	豈不前說，所至所趣乃說為生，中有不爾。	Isn't it said before that the place where one arrives and goes is called rebirth, but the intermediate state is not like this?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b18_1']	又一業果多故無失，如一念業有多念果，一無色業色無色果。	又一業果多故無失，如一念業有多念果，一無色業色無色果。	Moreover, there is no fault in the result of one karma being many, just as one moment of karma has many moments of result, and one formless realm karma has form and formless realm results.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b18_20']	如是一業所引之果，有生有起，理何相違？	如是一業所引之果，有生有起，理何相違？	In the same way, how can there be a contradiction in the principle that the result led by one karma has rebirth and arising?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b19_17']	有餘部師執無中有，有與理教並相違故。	有餘部師執無中有，有與理教並相違故。	Other schools hold that there is no intermediate state, but this contradicts both principle and teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b21_15']	理相違者，前蘊滅處、後異即生，俱有過故，謂若異處前蘊滅已，異處後生則無中有。	理相違者，前蘊滅處、後異即生，俱有過故，謂若異處前蘊滅已，異處後生則無中有。	As for contradicting principle, the previous aggregates cease in one place, and the subsequent ones arise in a different place, both of which have faults. This means that if the previous aggregates cease in one place and the subsequent ones arise in a different place, then there is no intermediate state.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b22_13']	如何不許死有無間即於異處生有蘊生？	如何不許死有無間即於異處生有蘊生？	Why do you not admit that the intermediate existence is born in another place without any interval after death?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b24_11']	若於此處前蘊滅已，此處後生亦無中有，是則應許死有無間即於此處生有蘊生。	若於此處前蘊滅已，此處後生亦無中有，是則應許死有無間即於此處生有蘊生。	If the aggregates of the prior existence perish in this place and the aggregates of the subsequent existence are born in this place without an intermediate existence, then you must admit that the aggregates of the subsequent existence are born in this place without any interval after death.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b25_11']	如是中有異前滅處，若生不生皆無用故。	如是中有異前滅處，若生不生皆無用故。	In this way, the intermediate existence is different from the place where the prior existence perished. If it is born, it is born in another place. If it is not born, it is useless to be born.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b26_11']	死有無間生有即生，其理極成，故無中有。	死有無間生有即生，其理極成，故無中有。	Therefore, the aggregates of the subsequent existence are born without any interval after death. The principle is well established, and therefore there is no intermediate existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468b29_8']	又曾不說中有業故，謂有經說順現受等三業不同，曾無契經說有第四順中有業，不可說中有無業而生，勿一切無因自然生故。	又曾不說中有業故，謂有經說順現受等三業不同，曾無契經說有第四順中有業，不可說中有無業而生，勿一切無因自然生故。	Also, because the existence of an intermediate existence is not taught by the scriptures. That is, some scriptures teach that there are three kinds of karma, that is, karma whose results are experienced in the present life, etc. There is no scripture that teaches that there is a fourth kind of karma whose results are experienced in an intermediate existence. It cannot be said that an intermediate existence is born without karma, because then everything would be born without a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c01_19']	又應諸有情皆具神通故，謂離功用，一切有情皆應性得神通自在；	又應諸有情皆具神通故，謂離功用，一切有情皆應性得神通自在；	Also, because all sentient beings would be endowed with supernatural powers. That is, all sentient beings would naturally possess supernatural powers and freedom without effort.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c02_17']	然多用功少有成辦，是故中有理定應無。	然多用功少有成辦，是故中有理定應無。	However, many expend effort and few achieve success. Therefore, an intermediate existence must be nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c03_16']	又許有死生有應成，謂要有生方有死故；	又許有死生有應成，謂要有生方有死故；	Also, if you admit that there is death, there must be birth, because there is death only if there is birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c05_14']	若許有死不由生成，有太過失，謂於諸趣雖無頓生應有頓死，無生有死理極相違。	若許有死不由生成，有太過失，謂於諸趣雖無頓生應有頓死，無生有死理極相違。	Also, if you admit that there is death without birth, then there would be the error of too much, because even though there is no sudden birth in the various destinies, there would be sudden death. The principle of death without birth is extremely contradictory.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c06_13']	又取有無俱成失故，謂死無間取中有不？	又取有無俱成失故，謂死無間取中有不？	Also, there would be the error of both existence and nonexistence of grasping, because does the intermediate existence grasp after death or not?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c07_8']	若取應生，經所說故，如契經說：	若取應生，經所說故，如契經說：	If it grasps, then it would be born, because of the scriptures. A scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c08_2']	若捨此身更取餘身，我記生故。	若捨此身更取餘身，我記生故。	“When one abandons this body and grasps another body, I predict that one will be born.”
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c09_1']	如其不取，應般涅槃，既般涅槃，何有中有？	如其不取，應般涅槃，既般涅槃，何有中有？	If it does not grasp, then it should enter nirvāṇa. Since it has entered nirvāṇa, how could there be an intermediate existence?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c10_8']	又彼應有無窮過故，謂死生間既有中有，生中中死兩隙寧無？	又彼應有無窮過故，謂死生間既有中有，生中中死兩隙寧無？	Also, there would be the error of endlessness, because if there is an intermediate existence between death and birth, then how could there be no intermediate existence between the birth of the intermediate existence and death?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c10_17']	設有便成無窮過失。	設有便成無窮過失。	If there is, then there would be the error of endlessness.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c11_12']	如是略辯與理相違、與教相違。	如是略辯與理相違、與教相違。	Thus we have briefly discussed the contradictions with reason and the contradictions with the teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c12_2']	今次當說，謂世尊說：	今次當說，謂世尊說：	Now we will explain further. The World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c12_11']	預流有情極於七有。	預流有情極於七有。	Beings who are stream-enterers are reborn at most seven times.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c13_6']	若有中有，世尊應言極十四有。	若有中有，世尊應言極十四有。	If there were an intermediate existence, the World-Honored One should have said that they are reborn at most fourteen times.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c14_1']	又無間業應成有間，謂契經言：	又無間業應成有間，謂契經言：	Moreover, the uninterrupted karma would become interrupted, because a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c14_15']	五無間業作已，無間生地獄中。	五無間業作已，無間生地獄中。	Having committed the five uninterrupted karmas, one is immediately reborn in hell.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c15_4']	若隔中有，違無間義。	若隔中有，違無間義。	If there were an intermediate existence in between, it would contradict the meaning of being uninterrupted.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c15_19']	又有中住，契經所遮，謂契經說：	又有中住，契經所遮，謂契經說：	Moreover, the existence of an intermediate existence is refuted in a scripture, which says:
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c16_0']	「再生汝今過盛位，　　至衰將近琰魔王，	「再生汝今過盛位，　　至衰將近琰魔王，	Regeneration, you now pass beyond the flourishing stage, and approach the end of life under the king of death.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c17_17']	欲往前路無資糧，　　求住中間無所止。	欲往前路無資糧，　　求住中間無所止。	Desiring to go on the road ahead but lacking provisions, seeking to stay in the middle but having no place to rest.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c18_17']	」若有中有，如何世尊言彼中間無有所止？	」若有中有，如何世尊言彼中間無有所止？	If there were an intermediate existence, how could the World-Honored One say that there is no place to rest in between?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c19_12']	又彼非為宿住智緣，謂契經言：	又彼非為宿住智緣，謂契經言：	Moreover, it is not the object of the knowledge of past abodes, because a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c20_6']	知宿住者，言我彼歿來生此間。	知宿住者，言我彼歿來生此間。	One who knows past abodes says, 'I died there and was reborn here.'
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c20_15']	不言彼歿曾生中有。	不言彼歿曾生中有。	It does not say that after dying, one was first born in an intermediate existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c21_14']	由與如是理教相違，故知定無中有可得。	由與如是理教相違，故知定無中有可得。	Because it contradicts such principles and teachings, we know for sure that there is no intermediate existence to be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c22_13']	前宗所執略述如是，今謂一切皆非證因。	前宗所執略述如是，今謂一切皆非證因。	The previous school's assertions are briefly described in this way. Now, I say that all of them are not established by evidence.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c24_6']	且彼初說，前蘊滅處、後異即生，俱有過者，此難非理，許隣死處中有生故。	且彼初說，前蘊滅處、後異即生，俱有過者，此難非理，許隣死處中有生故。	First, as for their statement that the previous aggregates cease and the subsequent ones arise differently, both incurring faults, this objection is unreasonable, because it is accepted that the intermediate existence arises adjacent to the place of death.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c26_13']	謂許中有於前死處，非隔非即隣次而起，如是後後乃至結生恒隣次起，故無前失，至辯自宗當更顯示。	謂許中有於前死處，非隔非即隣次而起，如是後後乃至結生恒隣次起，故無前失，至辯自宗當更顯示。	That is to say, it is accepted that the intermediate existence arises adjacent to the place of death, neither separated nor immediately adjacent. In this way, it arises adjacent to the subsequent [rebirths] up to the point of rebirth, and thus there is no previous fault. This will be further revealed when explaining our own school.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c27_13']	又言不說中有業者，理亦不然，有處說故。	又言不說中有業者，理亦不然，有處說故。	Moreover, their statement that the intermediate existence is not mentioned in the scriptures is also unreasonable, because it is mentioned in some places.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c27_18']	謂契經說：	謂契經說：	That is to say, a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c29_10']	我由如是雜滓穢身所造惡業，願令一切皆成現受，勿隨勿生勿後當受。	我由如是雜滓穢身所造惡業，願令一切皆成現受，勿隨勿生勿後當受。	By this defiled body I have created evil karma, I wish that all of it be transformed into present retribution, not following, not being born, not to be experienced in the future.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0468c29_19']	豈不隨言即顯中有？	豈不隨言即顯中有？	Isn't it clear that the intermediate existence is indicated by the word following?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a01_17']	謂現身後方便異熟順生順後，總說名隨。	謂現身後方便異熟順生順後，總說名隨。	That is to say, the ripening of skillful and unskillful karma that is experienced in the present life, in the next life, or in subsequent lives is generally called following.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a03_6']	中有名為方便異熟，以有惡業順中有受，故發遮願說勿隨言。	中有名為方便異熟，以有惡業順中有受，故發遮願說勿隨言。	The name of the middle one is that of the retribution of skillful means, because there is evil karma that conforms to the retribution of the intermediate state. Therefore, it is said that one should not follow the words of the vow.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a04_6']	或業能招當所往趣，此即能感中有異熟。	或業能招當所往趣，此即能感中有異熟。	Or, karma that can summon the future destiny is able to produce the retribution of the intermediate state.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a05_10']	中生二有一業所牽，如前已辯，故中有業不可言無。	中生二有一業所牽，如前已辯，故中有業不可言無。	The two existences of the intermediate state and birth are drawn by one karma, as has been explained previously. Therefore, the karma of the intermediate state cannot be said to be nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a06_18']	然佛世尊略說三種分位定業，感中有業攝在其中，故不別說。	然佛世尊略說三種分位定業，感中有業攝在其中，故不別說。	However, the World-Honored Buddha briefly explains three kinds of definite karmas, and the karma that summons the intermediate state is included in them. Therefore, he does not explain it separately.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a07_19']	又言諸有情應具神通者，亦不違理，此位有故。	又言諸有情應具神通者，亦不違理，此位有故。	Moreover, it is said that all sentient beings should be endowed with spiritual powers. This is also not contrary to reason, because this state exists.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a08_17']	若中有位一切有情具業成通，斯亦何咎？	若中有位一切有情具業成通，斯亦何咎？	If in the state of the intermediate state, all sentient beings are endowed with the spiritual powers accomplished by karma, what fault is there in this?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a10_7']	非此位有，例餘皆然，勿一時間作野干等或異生類則例恒然。	非此位有，例餘皆然，勿一時間作野干等或異生類則例恒然。	This state does not exist, but it is not the case for the rest. Do not take the example of a jackal or other ordinary beings at one time and take it as always being so.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a13_4']	或應汝曹謗中有者，許有情類皆具神通，謂諸有情於此處歿，能超無量億踰繕那極遠處生都無障礙，此外何有餘大神通？	或應汝曹謗中有者，許有情類皆具神通，謂諸有情於此處歿，能超無量億踰繕那極遠處生都無障礙，此外何有餘大神通？	Or you should slander the existence of the intermediate state, because you allow that all sentient beings possess supernatural powers, that is, all sentient beings, having died in this place, can go to a place extremely far away, beyond innumerable yojanas, and are born there without any obstruction at all. What other great supernatural power is there besides this?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a14_8']	又言許有死生有應成者，此難亦不然，許生差別故。	又言許有死生有應成者，此難亦不然，許生差別故。	Also, the objection that if you allow that there is death and birth, then there must be existence as birth, is also unreasonable, because we allow that birth is a different kind of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a17_7']	應理論者於生差別立中有名，非即生有，如往人趣，於未到間有生差別，是生方便，未名人趣已得名人，未到所應生、一業所引故。	應理論者於生差別立中有名，非即生有，如往人趣，於未到間有生差別，是生方便，未名人趣已得名人，未到所應生、一業所引故。	The proponents of the theory of the intermediate state establish the name existence as birth for a particular kind of birth, not for existence as birth itself. It is like going to the realm of humans. In the interval before arriving, there is a particular kind of birth, which is the means of birth. One is not yet called a human, but one has already obtained the name human. One has not yet reached the place where one should be born, because one is attracted by a single action.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a18_5']	由此故無諸趣頓死，許中有是生方便故。	由此故無諸趣頓死，許中有是生方便故。	For this reason, there is no sudden death in the various destinies, because it is allowed that the intermediate state is the means of birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0469a19_4']	由此亦答取有無因，於取差別名中有故。	由此亦答取有無因，於取差別名中有故。	For this reason, this also answers the question of whether there is a cause for grasping, because grasping is named the intermediate state.

It is seen that grains, etc., continue to be born in another place, and there is definitely no interruption in the middle place. Therefore, the continuity of sentient beings is also like this.

['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471a20_2']	然見月像有分限者，以彼本質有分限故，現像必隨所依本質。	然見月像有分限者，以彼本質有分限故，現像必隨所依本質。	However, the reason why the reflected moon has a limited size is because its original substance has a limited size. The reflected image must follow the original substance on which it is based.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471a21_10']	或無分限本質為緣，於水上生無分限像，猶如於水現空想青。	或無分限本質為緣，於水上生無分限像，猶如於水現空想青。	Or, if the original substance has no limited size as a condition, a limitless reflected image arises in the water, just like the blue sky is reflected in the water.

Therefore, in terms of your assertion, there is also no meaning of contradiction. Then the reason you state is not accepted by either party.

['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b12_14']	同處雖無亦應可取，汝執無者亦可取故。	同處雖無亦應可取，汝執無者亦可取故。	Even though they do not occupy the same place, they should still be apprehensible, because what you assert as non-existent can also be apprehended.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b13_13']	亦不可說非一切無皆悉可取，無異因故。	亦不可說非一切無皆悉可取，無異因故。	It cannot be said that not all non-existents are apprehensible, because there is no different reason.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b14_11']	謂一切無相無差別，故不可說可不可取。	謂一切無相無差別，故不可說可不可取。	Because all are without characteristics and without distinctions, they cannot be said to be graspable or ungraspable.

Only in the existent, due to the distinction of states, many colors can be grasped, but not in the non-existent.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b18_8']	要於實有所見境中，由根明遠近方所等差別，得有邪正了色不同。	要於實有所見境中，由根明遠近方所等差別，得有邪正了色不同。	It is necessary that regarding the actually seen object, due to the distinction of the faculties, clarity, distance, direction, etc., there can be right and wrong, with the understanding of color being different.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b19_16']	如觀日光所照實有，蠨蛸網色孔雀尾輪，方所等殊所見有異。	如觀日光所照實有，蠨蛸網色孔雀尾輪，方所等殊所見有異。	Just as observing the actually existent color illuminated by the sunlight, the color of a spider's web, the tail of a peacock, the direction of a wheel, etc., the views have differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b21_5']	亦如觀見旋火輪等，是故定知實有像色，由分位別有取眾多。	亦如觀見旋火輪等，是故定知實有像色，由分位別有取眾多。	It is also like observing and seeing a whirling fire wheel, etc. Therefore, it is definitely known that there are real images, with the many being grasped due to the distinction of states.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b21_15']	故彼遮因，翻證像有。	故彼遮因，翻證像有。	Therefore, their refuting reason, on the contrary, proves the existence of images.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b23_3']	或如燈焰眾色雜居，由所住方有礙別故，非住一切見皆周盡。	或如燈焰眾色雜居，由所住方有礙別故，非住一切見皆周盡。	Or, just as the flame of a lamp is mixed with many colors, due to the obstruction of the location where it resides, it does not reside everywhere, with the view being completely exhausted.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b24_2']	又如觀箭曲直不同，雖有取多亦無有過。	又如觀箭曲直不同，雖有取多亦無有過。	Also, it is like observing an arrow as either straight or bent. Although it grasps many, there is no fault.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b26_1']	雖無一處異色同止，而有取時謂為同處，如斯理趣前已具論，故彼推徵於像無害。	雖無一處異色同止，而有取時謂為同處，如斯理趣前已具論，故彼推徵於像無害。	Although there is no difference in color in one place, when it is grasped, it is called the same place. This principle has already been fully discussed before, so their investigation does not harm the reflection.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b27_11']	又彼所說其量無差見動作故像非實者，理亦不然，前已說故。	又彼所說其量無差見動作故像非實者，理亦不然，前已說故。	Also, their statement that the reflection is not real because its size is undifferentiated but its movement is seen is also unreasonable, because it has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471b29_16']	謂雖別有實像色生，而像必隨所依本質，故量雖等，而隨所應於所依上，如其本質有顯形動三種像生。	謂雖別有實像色生，而像必隨所依本質，故量雖等，而隨所應於所依上，如其本質有顯形動三種像生。	That is to say, although the real reflected color arises separately, the reflection must follow the original substance that it depends on. Therefore, although the size is the same, according to what is appropriate, on the basis of what it depends on, three kinds of reflected images arise, namely, the manifest, the shaped, and the moving, just like the original substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c02_6']	像隨所依及本質故，雖無動作而似往來，及餘運動三用可得。	像隨所依及本質故，雖無動作而似往來，及餘運動三用可得。	Because the reflection follows what it depends on and the original substance, although there is no movement, it appears as if it goes and comes, and the other two uses of movement can be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c06_3']	如是動相，或由本質餘方運轉無間生故，或由所依隨持者等有動搖故，或由觀者自有動搖謂像轉故，如是諸像不越所依分量處所，隨本質等見有往來及餘動相。	如是動相，或由本質餘方運轉無間生故，或由所依隨持者等有動搖故，或由觀者自有動搖謂像轉故，如是諸像不越所依分量處所，隨本質等見有往來及餘動相。	Such moving images are due to the movement of the substance in another place, or to the movement of the support, or to the movement of the observer himself, that is, the image moves. In this way, the images do not exceed the dimensions of their supports, and one sees them moving back and forth and in other ways.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c06_12']	此於造色有何相違？	此於造色有何相違？	What contradiction is there in this with the created form?
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c08_9']	言見有此故非造色，不可異餘造色相故便非造色，如青黃等雖互相異而是造色。	言見有此故非造色，不可異餘造色相故便非造色，如青黃等雖互相異而是造色。	It is said that because one sees it, it is not created form. It cannot be that it is not created form because it is different from other created forms, just as blue and yellow, etc., are different from each other but are created form.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c09_9']	或應堅相異煖等故便非大種，餘例亦然。	或應堅相異煖等故便非大種，餘例亦然。	Or, because the characteristic of solidity is different from heat, etc., it should not be a great element. The same is the case with the others.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c10_16']	如諸大種與所造色，雖互相異而色性同，故此無能遮造色性。	如諸大種與所造色，雖互相異而色性同，故此無能遮造色性。	Just as the great elements and the created form, although different from each other, are the same in having the nature of form, therefore there is no ability to block the nature of created form.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c12_14']	又彼所說見像及依處各別故非造色者，理亦不然，空界月像同依水等而發生故。	又彼所說見像及依處各別故非造色者，理亦不然，空界月像同依水等而發生故。	Also, what they say, that the image and the support are seen as separate and therefore it is not created form, is also unreasonable, because the image of the moon in the sky and the image in the water are both produced in dependence on the water, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c14_5']	謂空界色與彼月輪，次第安布近遠差別，是見依像處差別因。	謂空界色與彼月輪，次第安布近遠差別，是見依像處差別因。	That is, the color of the space element and the moon disc are arranged in sequence, with a difference of near and far. This is the cause of the difference in the place of the seen image.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c15_12']	空界是有，色處所攝，前已成立，故與月輪於水等上各能生像。	空界是有，色處所攝，前已成立，故與月輪於水等上各能生像。	The space element is existent and is included in the form realm. This has already been established, so it can each give rise to an image on water and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c16_12']	由所生像與質相同，故見與依處似差別。	由所生像與質相同，故見與依處似差別。	Because the generated image is the same as the substance, the seen and the support seem to be different places.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c17_11']	或由如是見緣和合，非遠近中令見遠近。	或由如是見緣和合，非遠近中令見遠近。	Or, because of seeing such a combination, it causes the seen to be far or near, even though it is not far or near.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c18_10']	如觀采畫錦繡等文，無高下中見有高下；	如觀采畫錦繡等文，無高下中見有高下；	Just as when observing a painting or embroidery, one sees high and low even though there is no high or low.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c19_1']	由月遠故，見像亦然。	由月遠故，見像亦然。	Because the moon is far, the seen image is also like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_023:0471c19_11']	如滿月輪，見像無缺。	如滿月輪，見像無缺。	Just as the full moon disc is seen without a lack in the image.
