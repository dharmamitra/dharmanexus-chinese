['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854a11_18']	譬中「色空」即譬二諦。	譬中「色空」即譬二諦。	In the example, form and emptiness is an analogy for the two truths.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854a13_9']	引事中引近事以況遠理，入事禪如「悟真」，身虛心豁如「了俗」。	引事中引近事以況遠理，入事禪如「悟真」，身虛心豁如「了俗」。	In citing events, citing recent events to illustrate distant principles, entering events and meditation is like realizing the truth, and the body being empty and the mind open is like understanding the conventional.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854a14_6']	譬顯中見惑如「小雲」，思惑如「大雲」。	譬顯中見惑如「小雲」，思惑如「大雲」。	In the analogy, the view afflictions are like small clouds, and the thought afflictions are like large clouds.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854a14_22']	「無漏」謂見真，「世智」謂了俗。	「無漏」謂見真，「世智」謂了俗。	Pure refers to seeing the truth, and worldly wisdom refers to understanding the conventional.

['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854a23_6']	初文者，凡諸釋義或從廣之略、或先略後廣，從略即預用跨節，從廣則教門當分，故略言之唯一法性以對無明，無明是迷真之始，法性則全指無明無始時來奚甞非真，未發心前無真不俗，秖點一法，二諦宛然。	初文者，凡諸釋義或從廣之略、或先略後廣，從略即預用跨節，從廣則教門當分，故略言之唯一法性以對無明，無明是迷真之始，法性則全指無明無始時來奚甞非真，未發心前無真不俗，秖點一法，二諦宛然。	In the first text, when explaining various meanings, sometimes it goes from broad to brief, or first brief and then broad. From brief, it immediately uses the cross-section method, and from broad, the teaching method is according to the division. Therefore, it briefly says there is only one Dharma nature to correspond to ignorance. Ignorance is the beginning of confusion about truth. The Dharma nature completely points to ignorance. Since beginningless time, how could it ever not be true? Before giving rise to the mind, there is no truth that is not worldly. It only points to one Dharma, and the two truths are evident.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854a26_14']	俗即百界千如，真即同居一念，仍顯相異，義理雖足其如麁淺，聞之墮苦，故佛於一代曲開七重、二十一重以赴物情，使佛本懷暢、使物宿種遂故。	俗即百界千如，真即同居一念，仍顯相異，義理雖足其如麁淺，聞之墮苦，故佛於一代曲開七重、二十一重以赴物情，使佛本懷暢、使物宿種遂故。	The worldly is the hundred realms and thousand suchnesses, and the true is the same dwelling in a single thought. It still shows the difference in appearance. Although the meaning and principles are sufficient, it is still coarse and shallow. Hearing it leads to suffering. Therefore, the Buddha in the one period of teaching skillfully opened seven layers and twenty-one layers to respond to people's feelings, to make the Buddha's original intention flourish and to fulfill people's past seeds.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854a27_9']	以下二門判之開之，意如前說。	以下二門判之開之，意如前說。	Therefore, the following two gates are used to distinguish and open it. The meaning is as explained above.

['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b03_14']	初意者，一藏，二通，三別接通，四圓接通，五別，六圓接別，七圓。	初意者，一藏，二通，三別接通，四圓接通，五別，六圓接別，七圓。	The first meaning is: one canon, two common, three distinctions connecting the common, four circles connecting the common, five distinctions, six circles connecting the distinctions, seven circles.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b06_17']	若《止觀》中為成理觀，但以界外理以接界內理，故藏通兩教明界內理，別圓二教明界外理，通別兩教是明兩理之交際，是故但明別接通耳。	若《止觀》中為成理觀，但以界外理以接界內理，故藏通兩教明界內理，別圓二教明界外理，通別兩教是明兩理之交際，是故但明別接通耳。	If in the Zhiguan, in order to accomplish the principle contemplation, only the principle outside the realm is used to connect the principle inside the realm, therefore the two teachings of the canon and the common clarify the principle inside the realm, and the two teachings of the distinction and the circle clarify the principle outside the realm. The two teachings of the common and the distinction are the juncture of clarifying the two principles, therefore only the distinction connecting the common is explained.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b10_1']	今前六重仍存教道，於法華前逗彼權機，故有圓接通別二義，實道秖應圓理接權，故釋今文，應順教道復以圓中接於但中。	今前六重仍存教道，於法華前逗彼權機，故有圓接通別二義，實道秖應圓理接權，故釋今文，應順教道復以圓中接於但中。	The first six layers still preserve the path of teaching, accommodating those provisional capacities before the Lotus Sūtra, thus there are two meanings of the perfect accommodating the shared and the distinct. The real path should only accommodate the provisional with the perfect principle, thus the interpretation of this text should follow the path of teaching and further accommodate the mere emptiness with the perfect middle.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b12_6']	又此七名雖立二諦，後之五意義已含三，幻有即俗，空即是真，不空是中，但觀名中空，合在何諦？	又此七名雖立二諦，後之五意義已含三，幻有即俗，空即是真，不空是中，但觀名中空，合在何諦？	Moreover, although these seven names establish the two truths, the latter five meanings already contain three: illusory existence is the conventional, emptiness is the true, and non-emptiness is the middle. The mere contemplation of emptiness is called the middle, so in which truth is it included?
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b13_5']	若合在俗諦，即如別教名含真入俗二諦；	若合在俗諦，即如別教名含真入俗二諦；	If it is included in the conventional truth, it is like the distinct teaching's name containing the true entering the conventional two truths;
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b15_6']	若合入真諦，如別圓入通名含中入真二諦，藏通即名單俗單真，圓教即名不思議真俗。	若合入真諦，如別圓入通名含中入真二諦，藏通即名單俗單真，圓教即名不思議真俗。	if it is included in the true truth, it is like the distinct and perfect entering the shared name containing the middle entering the true two truths. The shared and distinct teachings are then called the single conventional and the single true, and the perfect teaching is called the inconceivable true and conventional.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b16_2']	細得此意，尋名釋義不失毫微。	細得此意，尋名釋義不失毫微。	If one carefully understands this meaning, when seeking the names and interpreting the meanings, one will not miss even a hair's breadth.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b19_8']	次解釋中文自為七，若欲憑教者，然此七文散在諸經，無一處具出，唯《大經》十二，四諦文後列八二諦，章安作七二諦銷之，初一是總，餘七是別。	次解釋中文自為七，若欲憑教者，然此七文散在諸經，無一處具出，唯《大經》十二，四諦文後列八二諦，章安作七二諦銷之，初一是總，餘七是別。	Next, the explanation of the text itself has seven parts. If one wishes to rely on the teachings, these seven passages are scattered throughout various sūtras and are not found in one place. Only the Great Sūtra in twelve parts, after the passage on the four truths, lists eight kinds of two truths. Zhizhe composed seven kinds of two truths to explain them. The first is general, and the remaining seven are specific.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b20_17']	初云「如出世人心所見者，名第一義諦，世人心所見者，名為世諦。	初云「如出世人心所見者，名第一義諦，世人心所見者，名為世諦。	The first states: That which is seen by the mind of the one who has transcended the world is called the ultimate truth, and that which is seen by the worldly mind is called the worldly truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b22_14']	」疏云總冠諸諦，世情多種束為世諦，聖智多知束為第一義諦，即是諸教隨情智也。	」疏云總冠諸諦，世情多種束為世諦，聖智多知束為第一義諦，即是諸教隨情智也。	The commentary states: This is the general crown of all truths. The many kinds of worldly feelings are gathered into the worldly truth, and the many kinds of knowledge of the sages are gathered into the ultimate truth. This is the teachings that follow along with feelings and knowledge.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b23_11']	經云「五陰和合稱名某甲，是名世諦；	經云「五陰和合稱名某甲，是名世諦；	The sūtra states: The combination of the five aggregates is called by the name of a certain person. This is called the worldly truth;

['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b27_5']	無陰無名即假實空，若離陰者名太虛空，是故離陰亦無某甲及二諦名。	無陰無名即假實空，若離陰者名太虛空，是故離陰亦無某甲及二諦名。	Without aggregates and without names is the emptiness of the provisional and the real. If apart from the aggregates, it is called the great empty space. Therefore, apart from the aggregates, there is also no so-and-so or the names of the two truths.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b27_14']	疏云名無名二諦也。	疏云名無名二諦也。	The commentary says it is the two truths of name and no-name.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854b28_13']	世諦有名、真諦無名，即生滅二諦也。	世諦有名、真諦無名，即生滅二諦也。	The conventional truth has names, the ultimate truth has no names. This is the two truths of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c01_4']	經云「或有法有名有實是名第一義諦，或有法有名無實是名世諦。	經云「或有法有名有實是名第一義諦，或有法有名無實是名世諦。	The sutra says, Some dharmas have names and substance, this is called the ultimate truth. Some dharmas have names but no substance, this is called the conventional truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c01_19']	」幻化假名即空，故實即真諦也。	」幻化假名即空，故實即真諦也。	Illusory transformations are provisionally named emptiness, therefore the substance is the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c03_4']	秖指幻化，但有假名，故名世諦，故疏云實不實二諦也。	秖指幻化，但有假名，故名世諦，故疏云實不實二諦也。	Only pointing to illusory transformations, there are only provisional names, therefore it is called the conventional truth. Therefore the commentary says it is the two truths of substance and non-substance.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c03_19']	真實幻化不實也，即無生二諦也。	真實幻化不實也，即無生二諦也。	The real is illusory transformations, which are not real. This is the two truths of non-arising.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c05_19']	經云「如我人眾生壽命知見，乃至如龜毛兔角等，陰界入是名世諦，苦集滅道是名真諦。	經云「如我人眾生壽命知見，乃至如龜毛兔角等，陰界入是名世諦，苦集滅道是名真諦。	The sutra says, Self, person, sentient being, life, knowing and seeing, up to tortoise hair and rabbit horns, etc., the aggregates, realms, and sense bases are called the conventional truth. Suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path are called the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c07_11']	」兔角之俗與前不殊，故成單俗，四諦義含共為真諦，即是含中真諦也。	」兔角之俗與前不殊，故成單俗，四諦義含共為真諦，即是含中真諦也。	The common of rabbit horns is no different from the previous, so it becomes a single common. The meaning of the four truths includes the common and becomes the truth of ultimate truth, which is the truth of ultimate truth that includes the middle way.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c08_2']	故疏云定不定二諦也。	故疏云定不定二諦也。	Therefore, the commentary says it is the two truths of definite and indefinite.

['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c14_7']	」五種世法名與前異，大意不別亦是單俗，於世無倒謂見實相，教道但中雖未究竟，此中究竟望前故實，故疏云法不法二諦也。	」五種世法名與前異，大意不別亦是單俗，於世無倒謂見實相，教道但中雖未究竟，此中究竟望前故實，故疏云法不法二諦也。	The names of the five kinds of worldly dharmas are different from the previous, but the general meaning is no different. They are also the single common. Being without inversion regarding the world is called seeing the true aspect. The teaching path is only the middle way, although it is not yet ultimate. In this context, it is ultimate compared to the previous, so it is real. Therefore, the commentary says it is the two truths of dharma and non-dharma.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c15_6']	法謂實相，不法謂俗，亦是含中二諦也。	法謂實相，不法謂俗，亦是含中二諦也。	Dharma refers to the true aspect, and non-dharma refers to the common. It is also the two truths that include the middle way.

Ascending to the grounds and seeing permanence, there is no burning, etc. Therefore, the commentary says it is the two truths of burning and not burning.

The absence of the eight kinds of suffering is precisely the true aspect, so the commentary says it is the two truths of suffering and non-suffering, which is also the complex conventional and the simple middle.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c22_14']	教道有苦，圓中無苦。	教道有苦，圓中無苦。	The teaching path has suffering, the perfect middle has no suffering.

Relying on parents to be born is called conventional truth, relying on the combination of the twelve links of dependent origination to be born is called ultimate truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0854c27_10']	」依父母生即十二緣，而分二者，以《大經》中明十二緣即佛性故，且據顯說，即以佛性而為真諦，依父母生即是無明名為世諦。	」依父母生即十二緣，而分二者，以《大經》中明十二緣即佛性故，且據顯說，即以佛性而為真諦，依父母生即是無明名為世諦。	The twelve conditions based on the birth from parents are divided into two because the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra clarifies that the twelve conditions are precisely buddha-nature. It is based on the manifest teaching that buddha-nature is taken as ultimate truth, and the birth from parents is precisely ignorance, which is called conventional truth.

All take the general similarities of the categories to meet, if further elaborated in detail, it is feared to be cumbersome and mixed.
['ZH_T33_1717_006:0860c06_12']	如無量無作中云「界外四聖涅槃」者，涅槃之名通大小故，且用言之，故云「亦是般若解脫，亦是法身」也。	如無量無作中云「界外四聖涅槃」者，涅槃之名通大小故，且用言之，故云「亦是般若解脫，亦是法身」也。	As in the immeasurable and non-abiding it says the four holy nirvanas outside the realms, the name nirvana is common to both the great and small vehicles, so it is used to speak of it, therefore it says it is also prajna and liberation, it is also the dharma body.

If the characteristics and nature are the same, there is no distinction. It is like the characteristics and nature of the six destinies not yet being called the truth of non-existence, and the four holy ones only being able to be generally called the truth of non-existence.
