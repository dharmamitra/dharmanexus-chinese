The ten grounds and harmonies fuse compassion, vows, wisdom, and principle, equal and vast, pervading the Dharma realm, equal to the extent of sentient beings. The Dharma is manifested in the middle way, and in the middle place, it still speaks of the meaning of the middle way. Speaking of the ten grounds and harmonizing compassion, vows, wisdom, and principle, it is in the middle place of the desire realm, because the Heaven of Joy has both heavens above and below.

['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878a06_15']	第四禪表佛果周妙，用圓滿故。	第四禪表佛果周妙，用圓滿故。	The fourth dhyana symbolizes the perfection of the Buddha fruit, as its function is complete.

It also clarifies that the wisdom of each ground is progressively higher, surpassing the sequence.

Therefore, it does not rely on the emptiness contemplation to subdue the presently active afflictions. The ten grounds are only for attaining the mind-born body.
['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878a20_2']	此教雖說如來無量色受想行識及心意者，明不壞俗境以達成差別智故，非同伏惑留生往生淨土故。	此教雖說如來無量色受想行識及心意者，明不壞俗境以達成差別智故，非同伏惑留生往生淨土故。	Although this teaching speaks of the Tathāgata's immeasurable form, feeling, perception, impulse, and consciousness, and the mind and thought, it clarifies that the undestroyed conventional realm is used to accomplish the wisdom of distinctions. It is not the same as subduing the afflictions and remaining in birth to be reborn in the Pure Land.

Compared to this teaching, within the initial mind of faith, it only takes the limitless Buddha realm, with the ten directions contained in a particle of dust and the Dharma realm contained in a single hair, as the basis for faith and progress in practice. It does not say that the three thousand great one-thousand worlds are the Buddha's reward realm. It is just like the chapter on the Virtuous Leader being the gateway for what is believed, delighted in, and cultivated, and the chapter on the Merits of Generating the Mind being the virtues of realization and entry into the ten abodes.

The enlightenment of cultivating the ten kinds of similar true suchness contemplations, cultivating the ten perfections, having the ten hindrances to true suchness, the eleven kinds of coarseness, and the twenty-two kinds of foolishness;

The enlightenment of relying on the ten kinds of wisdom of the Tathāgata to cultivate the ten perfections, taking endless eons as a single instant, harmonizing with endless many lives as a single life and thought, and the wisdom of the Tathāgata when delusion is resolved.
['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878b02_12']	此明依根本智發菩提心。	此明依根本智發菩提心。	This clarifies the generation of the enlightenment mind based on fundamental wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878b05_5']	如《起信論》亦有此文，「依本覺故而有不覺」，又云「覺心源故名究竟覺」，明知依如來智上而有不覺，依無明上而有覺者。	如《起信論》亦有此文，「依本覺故而有不覺」，又云「覺心源故名究竟覺」，明知依如來智上而有不覺，依無明上而有覺者。	As the Awakening of Faith also has this text, Based on original enlightenment, non-enlightenment exists, and also says, Because one awakens to the source of the enlightened mind, it is called ultimate enlightenment, it is clear that based on the Tathāgata's wisdom, non-enlightenment exists, and based on ignorance, enlightenment exists.
['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878b06_4']	於此覺者，隨根種性有此五種覺法差別。	於此覺者，隨根種性有此五種覺法差別。	In this enlightenment, there are these five kinds of distinctions in the Dharma of enlightenment according to the different spiritual capacities and natures of beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878b09_6']	如此經菩提，並一乘佛果根本智上不退菩提，如《起信論》說，或言超劫成佛，或云「我於無量劫修行成佛道」者，皆為懈慢眾生作無數方便。	如此經菩提，並一乘佛果根本智上不退菩提，如《起信論》說，或言超劫成佛，或云「我於無量劫修行成佛道」者，皆為懈慢眾生作無數方便。	This sutra's enlightenment is all the non-retrogressive enlightenment on the fundamental wisdom of the Buddha's fruition of the One Vehicle, as explained in the Awakening of Faith. Some say one transcends eons to become a Buddha, while some say, For innumerable eons I practiced and attained Buddhahood, all of which are skillful means for those with indolent minds.
['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878b10_19']	或云「要經三僧祇方得成佛」者，此皆逐世情說為三乘，不依根本智發心。	或云「要經三僧祇方得成佛」者，此皆逐世情說為三乘，不依根本智發心。	Some say one must go through three incalculable eons to become a Buddha, but these are all spoken for the sake of the three vehicles according to worldly sentiments, not based on the fundamental wisdom to give rise to the resolve for enlightenment.
['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878b14_6']	此教依智發心，若以智論之，不隨迷情，直以不可數阿僧祇劫以為無時，以此無時假施設，一剎那際攝無限三世劫，無限三世劫總不出一剎那際。	此教依智發心，若以智論之，不隨迷情，直以不可數阿僧祇劫以為無時，以此無時假施設，一剎那際攝無限三世劫，無限三世劫總不出一剎那際。	This teaching relies on wisdom to give rise to the mind. If discussed with wisdom, it does not follow deluded emotions. Directly taking innumerable asaṃkhyeya kalpas as timeless, using this timelessness to provisionally establish a single instant that encompasses infinite kalpas of the three times, and infinite kalpas of the three times are not apart from a single instant.

Using wisdom to encompass emotions, emotions dwell within wisdom, and immeasurable kalpas of emotions exist within the wisdom of a single instant.

['ZH_T36_1739_023:0878b20_19']	法界性中無別他方，以未至位處，名他方故。	法界性中無別他方，以未至位處，名他方故。	Within the nature of the Dharma realm, there is no separate other direction, because the place that has not yet reached is called the other direction.
