['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138b19_4']	所言有者，諸緣於何性而有所說？	所言有者，諸緣於何性而有所說？	002	What is meant by existence? In what nature do conditions have something to say?

['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138b20_19']	若有彼因及作用事，如上所說，此即為有如是果緣。	若有彼因及作用事，如上所說，此即為有如是果緣。	002	If there is that cause and the matter of function, as explained above, this is then the existence of such a causal condition.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138b21_14']	其義顯明，如瓶燈等，此應思擇。	其義顯明，如瓶燈等，此應思擇。	002	The meaning is clearly manifested, like a vase, lamp, etc., this should be contemplated.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138b22_18']	此中決定若有所離，即無所有亦非無有，緣不和合故。	此中決定若有所離，即無所有亦非無有，緣不和合故。	002	In this, if there is something to be separated, it is non-existent and also not non-existent, because the conditions do not combine.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138b24_17']	如所說果或果分位，彼三種功用能所性極成，彼若緣異即無功用所施作故，此說顯明。	如所說果或果分位，彼三種功用能所性極成，彼若緣異即無功用所施作故，此說顯明。	002	As it is said, the effect or the state of the effect, those three kinds of function and the nature of the agent are well established. If they rely on difference, then there is no function in what is done, this is clearly stated.

['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c09_7']	此中雖有亦復不成決定生性，彼有即是增上所作。	此中雖有亦復不成決定生性，彼有即是增上所作。	002	Although this exists, it is also not accomplished as a definite nature of production. That existence is the superior function.

['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c12_12']	謂以生時種類所作或有或無，後亦如是，不離有性無性或有所得。	謂以生時種類所作或有或無，後亦如是，不離有性無性或有所得。	002	It means that when arising, the type of activity is either existent or nonexistent, and later it is also like this, not apart from the nature of existence or nonexistence or having something to attain.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c13_18']	如是有諸緣論中說是相，非不有故，如兔角等亦有說相。	如是有諸緣論中說是相，非不有故，如兔角等亦有說相。	002	Such is the characteristic explained in the treatises on conditions, not because it is nonexistent, like the horns of a rabbit, which are also said to have characteristics.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c14_12']	此有說相即世俗諦，非勝義諦。	此有說相即世俗諦，非勝義諦。	002	This characteristic of having a description is the conventional truth, not the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c15_7']	能成彼果說名因緣，然彼亦無。	能成彼果說名因緣，然彼亦無。	002	That which can accomplish that effect is called the causal condition, but that also does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c15_16']	諸法不有亦非不有。	諸法不有亦非不有。	002	All dharmas are neither existent nor nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c17_3']	若其不有，即無法可成，若爾云何有此能成之因而得和合？	若其不有，即無法可成，若爾云何有此能成之因而得和合？	002	If they are nonexistent, then there is no dharma that can be accomplished. If so, how can there be this accomplishing cause that can be combined?
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c17_13']	有若不成，與成相違。	有若不成，與成相違。	002	If existence is not accomplished, it contradicts accomplishment.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c18_11']	無即決定不成，無彼有性生故，譬如兔角。	無即決定不成，無彼有性生故，譬如兔角。	002	Nonexistence is definitely not accomplished, because there is no arising of that existent nature, like the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c20_13']	亦有亦無決定不成，於一法中相違自性本不生故，二俱有過，以如是因成如是果，豈得和合？	亦有亦無決定不成，於一法中相違自性本不生故，二俱有過，以如是因成如是果，豈得和合？	002	Existence and non-existence together are definitely not established, because in one dharma, contradictory natures are originally unborn. Both [existence and non-existence] have faults, because such a cause produces such a result. How can they be combined?
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c22_6']	若或於彼心心所法而有取著，此即說為所緣緣法，如是決定彼不和合。	若或於彼心心所法而有取著，此即說為所緣緣法，如是決定彼不和合。	002	If there is attachment to the mind and mental factors, this is called the objective condition. In this way, they are definitely not combined.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c24_15']	若勝義諦中如是眼識等有法可說，彼法生時無言說性，是故此中非所緣法而得和合，若有所說彼即相違。	若勝義諦中如是眼識等有法可說，彼法生時無言說性，是故此中非所緣法而得和合，若有所說彼即相違。	002	If in the ultimate truth, such eye consciousness, etc., exist, when those dharmas arise, they have no nature of speech. Therefore, here the objective dharmas are not combined. If there is something to be said, that is contradictory.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c25_1']	無亦相違。	無亦相違。	002	Non-existence is also contradictory.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c25_20']	若有所緣，應知皆是世俗諦故，非勝義諦。	若有所緣，應知皆是世俗諦故，非勝義諦。	002	If there is an object, one should know that it is all due to the conventional truth, not the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0138c27_15']	勝義諦者，此中止遣，若有法轉時，即諸相隨轉，是即所緣，此說是為所緣緣法。	勝義諦者，此中止遣，若有法轉時，即諸相隨轉，是即所緣，此說是為所緣緣法。	002	In the ultimate truth, this is refuted. If a dharma is turning, then all characteristics follow and turn. This is called the objective condition.

['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a02_5']	彼體無成故。	彼體無成故。	002	Because its substance is not established.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a03_16']	又若等無間滅法，彼即容受所作為等無間緣，此中決定如是分別。	又若等無間滅法，彼即容受所作為等無間緣，此中決定如是分別。	002	Moreover, if a dharma that has ceased without interval, it is then able to be the immediately preceding condition that is acted upon by the six sense bases. Here, it is definitely distinguished in this way.

['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a09_5']	是故無彼次第緣法而得和合，以生滅性不和合故。	是故無彼次第緣法而得和合，以生滅性不和合故。	002	Therefore there is no dharma of the immediately preceding condition that can be combined, because the nature of arising and ceasing is not combined.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a09_19']	即滅即生，而彼滅緣當云何有？	即滅即生，而彼滅緣當云何有？	002	If it ceases and arises, how can there be a condition for that cessation?
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a10_9']	是故緣滅無說性可轉。	是故緣滅無說性可轉。	002	Therefore the nature of cessation has no turning.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a10_18']	如是則應生時為緣。	如是則應生時為緣。	002	In this case, it should be a condition at the time of arising.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a11_15']	若生時為緣者，生時已生又何用緣？	若生時為緣者，生時已生又何用緣？	002	If arising is a condition, then what is already arisen has no need for a condition.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a12_10']	生者起義，此不有故彼何有緣？	生者起義，此不有故彼何有緣？	002	What is arisen is the meaning of arising, and since this does not exist, how could there be a condition for it?
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a13_2']	若有所成即是增上緣法。	若有所成即是增上緣法。	002	If there is something to be accomplished, it is the dominant condition.
['ZH_T30_1567_002:0139a14_5']	此若決定，起伺察時即無所有，故此諸法皆無自性。	此若決定，起伺察時即無所有，故此諸法皆無自性。	002	If this is definite, then when investigation arises, it does not exist. Therefore, all these dharmas are without self-nature.
