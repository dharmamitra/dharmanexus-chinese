As the Buddha said, it is better to embrace a burning dry tree and have one's entire body scorched, than to have an unawakened mind regarding the Tathāgata's expedient secret teachings. Hearing about permanence, one then gives rise to slander, saying that the teachings of Māra are worldly songs and praises, and that those who speak of impermanence are truthful;

If one hears others say this, one should be frightened. One should have compassion for those who speak in this way. One should have deep faith that the Tathāgata's Dharma body abides, and is not destroyed by the dharmas of old age, sickness, and death. One should know that the World-Honored One is inconceivable, and so is his teaching. One should uphold well the sūtras taught by me, such as the Sūtra of the Dry Tree. This is how a bodhisattva can be self-reliant.

For those who are receptive to the teachings, you first speak of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and impurity. If you were to speak of the Dharma of abiding permanence to those whose faith is not yet firm, it would destroy their faculty of faith, and the ghee of permanence would not be digested.

For my disciples, I first teach the food of impurity, impermanence, suffering, and emptiness, which is soft. When their resolve for the Way has increased and they can accept the Great Vehicle, I then teach them this Mahāparinirvāṇa, which is the food of the six flavors - sweet, bitter, pungent, sour, salty, and bland - that is firm and substantial. With the bitter and sour flavors of suffering and impermanence, the salty flavor of non-self and suffering, the sweet flavor of blissful self, the bland flavor of the self of permanence, and the pungent flavor of the Dharma, I burn the firewood of afflictions with the fire of illusory practices and ripen the food of the Dharma of great parinirvāṇa, which is like nectar.
