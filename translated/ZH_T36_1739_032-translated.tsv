['ZH_T36_1739_032:0939c20_18']	如佉陀羅山者，是木名。	如佉陀羅山者，是木名。	032	As for the Kṛta mountains, this is the name of a tree.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0939c21_8']	尼民陀羅，此云持邊山。	尼民陀羅，此云持邊山。	032	Nimindhara means holding the edge mountain.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0939c22_7']	目真隣陀山，此云解脫，此是解脫龍所居處。	目真隣陀山，此云解脫，此是解脫龍所居處。	032	Mount Mucilinda is called liberation, which is where the liberation dragon resides.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0939c22_19']	優波尼沙陀分，前已釋訖。	優波尼沙陀分，前已釋訖。	032	The part of Upanishad is already explained above.

['ZH_T36_1739_032:0939c27_3']	如是已上都有百喻，如來出現身心智慧十無量事境界，皆是非喻為喻略示少分，是心智路絕，任不思議無性無作，任無限自在之功用故，非言量譬喻所表及故。	如是已上都有百喻，如來出現身心智慧十無量事境界，皆是非喻為喻略示少分，是心智路絕，任不思議無性無作，任無限自在之功用故，非言量譬喻所表及故。	032	Thus, above, there are a total of a hundred analogies. The realm of the Tathāgata's appearance, body, mind, wisdom, and the ten immeasurable matters, are all non-analogies used as analogies to briefly indicate a small part. This is the cessation of the path of mental cognition, relying on the inconceivable, natureless, and unconditioned, relying on the function of unlimited freedom, therefore it is not manifested by verbal cognition or analogy.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a01_7']	如此品付囑流通中，此法門不入餘眾生手者，樂學小乘三乘聲聞緣覺，樂空無我願生淨土者，是餘眾生，以未迴心住變易生死是餘眾生故。	如此品付囑流通中，此法門不入餘眾生手者，樂學小乘三乘聲聞緣覺，樂空無我願生淨土者，是餘眾生，以未迴心住變易生死是餘眾生故。	032	As for not entrusting this Dharma door to the hands of other sentient beings in the entrustment and dissemination section of this chapter, those who delight in learning the Lesser Vehicle, the Three Vehicles, the Hearers, and the Solitary Realizers, and those who delight in emptiness, no-self, and vowing to be born in the Pure Land, are other sentient beings, because they have not yet turned their minds and abide in the transformation death.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a02_13']	若有大心凡夫及三乘有迴心者，佛所付囑，名曰流通。	若有大心凡夫及三乘有迴心者，佛所付囑，名曰流通。	032	If there are ordinary beings with great resolve and those of the Three Vehicles who have turned their minds, they are entrusted by the Buddha and are called dissemination.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a04_3']	設令於此法聖位菩薩自所演說，無凡夫樂學，不名付囑，不名流通。	設令於此法聖位菩薩自所演說，無凡夫樂學，不名付囑，不名流通。	032	Even if this Dharma is expounded by a holy stage bodhisattva, if there are no ordinary beings who delight in learning it, it is not called entrusted and not called dissemination.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a05_14']	明此經付囑凡夫及三乘有迴心者，令使樂學，學已悟入，名曰流通。	明此經付囑凡夫及三乘有迴心者，令使樂學，學已悟入，名曰流通。	032	It is clarified that this sūtra is entrusted to ordinary beings and those of the Three Vehicles who have turned their minds, causing them to delight in learning, and after learning, to awaken and enter, which is called dissemination.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a06_10']	不付囑已生佛家入位十地已去菩薩。	不付囑已生佛家入位十地已去菩薩。	032	It is not entrusted to bodhisattvas who have already been born in the Buddha's family and entered the stages of the ten grounds and above.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a08_11']	若論十地已去入佛境界菩薩，十方此土數分難量，如來何須慮恐無人信樂、無人流通？	若論十地已去入佛境界菩薩，十方此土數分難量，如來何須慮恐無人信樂、無人流通？	032	If we discuss the bodhisattvas who have entered the Buddha's realm from the tenth ground onward, their number in the ten directions and this land is difficult to measure, how could the Tathāgata need to worry about no one believing and enjoying it, or no one circulating it?
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a10_13']	是故當知付大心凡夫及三乘迴心者，令其悟入，名曰付囑流通，不付囑十地已去大菩薩等。	是故當知付大心凡夫及三乘迴心者，令其悟入，名曰付囑流通，不付囑十地已去大菩薩等。	032	Therefore, you should know that it is entrusted to ordinary beings with great resolve and those of the three vehicles who have turned their minds, to enable them to awaken and enter, which is called entrusting and circulating, not entrusting to the great bodhisattvas from the tenth ground onward.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a13_5']	經意唯為趣向乘不思議乘菩薩說此法門，明趣向二乘凡夫迴心悟入法界乘，乘不思議乘十信十住令其昇進故。	經意唯為趣向乘不思議乘菩薩說此法門，明趣向二乘凡夫迴心悟入法界乘，乘不思議乘十信十住令其昇進故。	032	The meaning of the sūtra is only to explain this Dharma door for the bodhisattvas who are heading towards the inconceivable vehicle, to clarify that those who are heading towards the two vehicles and ordinary beings who turn their minds and awaken to enter the Dharma realm vehicle, ride the inconceivable vehicle, and the ten faiths and ten abodes enable them to advance.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a15_4']	又舉「輪王太子具足王相者，王命終後所有七寶不散滅喻，便以此子能治王正位故。	又舉「輪王太子具足王相者，王命終後所有七寶不散滅喻，便以此子能治王正位故。	032	Moreover, it cites the analogy of the son of a wheel-turning king who is fully endowed with the king's characteristics, after the king's life ends, the seven treasures do not disperse and disappear, because this son is able to govern the king's proper position.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a16_7']	若無此子，王命終後此諸寶等於七日中悉皆散滅。	若無此子，王命終後此諸寶等於七日中悉皆散滅。	032	If there were no such son, after the king's life ends, these treasures would all disperse and disappear within seven days.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a16_10']	佛子！	佛子！	032	Buddha's disciple!
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a18_12']	此經珍寶亦復如是，不入一切餘眾生手，唯除如來法王真子，生如來家、種如來相諸善根者。	此經珍寶亦復如是，不入一切餘眾生手，唯除如來法王真子，生如來家、種如來相諸善根者。	032	This precious sutra is also like this. It does not enter the hands of any other sentient beings, except for the true sons of the Dharma King, the Tathagata, who are born in the family of the Tathagata and plant the roots of goodness of the marks of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a19_11']	若無此等佛之真子，如是法門不久散滅。	若無此等佛之真子，如是法門不久散滅。	032	If there are no such true sons of the Buddha, this Dharma door will not last long and will be scattered and destroyed.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a20_15']	」明知但令凡夫發心悟入，不付囑十地已去諸菩薩故。	」明知但令凡夫發心悟入，不付囑十地已去諸菩薩故。	032	 It is clear that it only allows ordinary beings to give rise to the resolve and realize entry, and does not entrust it to the bodhisattvas who have already attained the ten grounds.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a22_11']	若論入地已去諸菩薩先得道者，數若世界海微塵猶尚未比，何慮無人流通？	若論入地已去諸菩薩先得道者，數若世界海微塵猶尚未比，何慮無人流通？	032	If we discuss the bodhisattvas who have entered the grounds and have attained the Way first, their number is like the dust motes in the ocean of worlds, and it is still not comparable. How can we worry that there will be no one to circulate it?
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a23_14']	意明設有聖者常說，無凡夫樂修悟入，其法自滅。	意明設有聖者常說，無凡夫樂修悟入，其法自滅。	032	It clarifies that if there are sages who always expound it, but there are no ordinary beings who enjoy cultivating and realizing entry, the Dharma will naturally disappear.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a24_8']	言無凡夫修行言滅，法無生滅。	言無凡夫修行言滅，法無生滅。	032	It says that if there are no ordinary beings practicing, the teaching will disappear, but the Dharma has no arising or ceasing.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a26_5']	經云「唯除如來法王真子生如來家種如來相諸善根」者，明如來以解脫智慧為家。	經云「唯除如來法王真子生如來家種如來相諸善根」者，明如來以解脫智慧為家。	032	The sutra says, Except for the true sons of the Dharma King, the Tathagata, who are born in the family of the Tathagata and plant the roots of goodness of the marks of the Tathagata, clarifying that the Tathagata takes liberation and wisdom as his family.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a28_9']	如一念無念，身心諸見已亡，便生如來無性妙理正智慧家故，名十住中初發心住，為初生佛家。	如一念無念，身心諸見已亡，便生如來無性妙理正智慧家故，名十住中初發心住，為初生佛家。	032	Just like a single thought without thought, when the various views of body and mind are already gone, one gives rise to the wondrous principle of the Tathagata's non-nature, the family of right wisdom and knowledge, and is therefore called the initial stage of the ten abodes, the abode of initial arousal of the mind, and is born into the Buddha's family for the first time.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940a29_4']	四地得三界法盡，亦名初生佛家。	四地得三界法盡，亦名初生佛家。	032	In the fourth stage, one attains the exhaustion of dharmas in the three realms, and is also called being born into the Buddha's family for the first time.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b01_6']	八地得一分無功用現前，亦名初生如來無生忍家。	八地得一分無功用現前，亦名初生如來無生忍家。	032	In the eighth stage, one attains a portion of effortless manifestation, and is also called being born into the Tathagata's family of acceptance of non-arising for the first time.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b01_11']	如前已說。	如前已說。	032	As explained above.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b04_1']	種如來相諸善根者，如來見一切法無性為性、無相為相，不壞相而無相，明智境相自真故，名種如來相。	種如來相諸善根者，如來見一切法無性為性、無相為相，不壞相而無相，明智境相自真故，名種如來相。	032	As for planting the wholesome roots of the characteristics of the Tathagata, the Tathagata sees that the nature of all dharmas is naturelessness, and the characteristics are signlessness, without destroying characteristics while being signless, because the characteristics of the realm of bright wisdom are originally true. Therefore, it is called planting the characteristics of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b04_17']	明自心智境界非生住滅，是如來相。	明自心智境界非生住滅，是如來相。	032	It is explained that the realm of one's own mind's wisdom is neither arising, abiding, nor ceasing, and is the characteristic of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b08_13']	明自心智慧等一切諸佛及以一切眾生智慧，皆一性無性、一相無相，無表裏中間，如虛空界，能隨眾生性欲樂現如影隨身，生無來處、滅無去處，達心境如幻是如來相。	明自心智慧等一切諸佛及以一切眾生智慧，皆一性無性、一相無相，無表裏中間，如虛空界，能隨眾生性欲樂現如影隨身，生無來處、滅無去處，達心境如幻是如來相。	032	Illuminating one's own mind, wisdom, and so forth, the wisdom of all Buddhas and all sentient beings is all of one nature, without nature, of one characteristic, without characteristics, without inside or outside, in between, like the realm of space, able to manifest according to the inclinations and desires of sentient beings, like a shadow following the body, arising without a place of coming, ceasing without a place of going, penetrating the mind and objects as illusory, this is the characteristic of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b09_7']	達如斯法者，是生在佛家。	達如斯法者，是生在佛家。	032	Those who penetrate such a Dharma are born in the Buddha's family.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b10_12']	種如來相諸善根者，種者，明有修學如來如是真智慧種故。	種如來相諸善根者，種者，明有修學如來如是真智慧種故。	032	Those who plant the roots of goodness of the characteristics of the Tathāgata, plant clarifies that there is the cultivation and study of the seeds of such true wisdom of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b12_9']	如是凡夫聞此法已，修學如來如是真智慧種，名為佛種不斷，名曰付囑流通。	如是凡夫聞此法已，修學如來如是真智慧種，名為佛種不斷，名曰付囑流通。	032	Thus, ordinary beings, having heard this Dharma, cultivate and study the seeds of such true wisdom of the Tathāgata, which is called the Buddha's lineage being unbroken, and is called entrusting and circulating.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b13_8']	是故當知此教不付囑已入位得道菩薩故。	是故當知此教不付囑已入位得道菩薩故。	032	Therefore, one should know that this teaching is not entrusted to bodhisattvas who have already entered the stages and attained the Way.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b17_10']	經云「設有菩薩於無量百千那由他劫行六波羅蜜，修集種種菩提分法，若未聞此如來不思議大威德法門，或時聞已不信不解、不順不入，不得名為真實菩薩，以不能生如來家故。	經云「設有菩薩於無量百千那由他劫行六波羅蜜，修集種種菩提分法，若未聞此如來不思議大威德法門，或時聞已不信不解、不順不入，不得名為真實菩薩，以不能生如來家故。	032	The sutra says, Suppose there are bodhisattvas who practice the six perfections for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of eons, cultivating various factors of enlightenment, but if they have not heard this inconceivable Dharma door of the great majestic virtue of the Tathāgata, or even if they have heard it, they do not believe, understand, follow, or enter it, they cannot be called true bodhisattvas, because they are unable to give rise to the family of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b20_2']	」如是菩薩即是權教中觀空無我、但欣出世，雖修六波羅蜜，厭苦發心樂求淨土，非是達自無明是根本如來智故。	」如是菩薩即是權教中觀空無我、但欣出世，雖修六波羅蜜，厭苦發心樂求淨土，非是達自無明是根本如來智故。	032	In this way, bodhisattvas in the provisional teachings contemplate emptiness and no-self, only delighting in transcending the world. Although they cultivate the six perfections, they are weary of suffering, give rise to the resolve [for enlightenment], and happily seek the Pure Land. This is not because they realize that their own ignorance is the fundamental wisdom of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b22_19']	此菩薩修於淨行，觀空無我、厭苦發心，取捨全在、二見恒存，非如此教依智發心達自心境本不思議，無欣厭心、無淨穢障故。	此菩薩修於淨行，觀空無我、厭苦發心，取捨全在、二見恒存，非如此教依智發心達自心境本不思議，無欣厭心、無淨穢障故。	032	These bodhisattvas cultivate pure practices, contemplate emptiness and no-self, are weary of suffering, give rise to the resolve [for enlightenment], and have grasping and rejecting, with the two views always present. This is not like the teachings of this sūtra, which rely on wisdom to give rise to the resolve [for enlightenment] and realize the originally inconceivable mind and objects, without the mind of delight and weariness, and without the hindrances of purity and defilement.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b24_5']	眾生境界是如來境界，眾生心是如來心，一如此品所說。	眾生境界是如來境界，眾生心是如來心，一如此品所說。	032	The realm of sentient beings is the realm of the Tathāgata, and the mind of sentient beings is the mind of the Tathāgata, just as explained in this chapter.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b26_1']	說此品時其地六種十八相動，說〈普賢行品〉直言六種震動者，為明直言行體。	說此品時其地六種十八相動，說〈普賢行品〉直言六種震動者，為明直言行體。	032	When this chapter was spoken, the earth shook in six ways and eighteen aspects. When speaking of the chapter on Samantabhadra's practices, it simply says it shook in six ways, to illustrate the essence of the practices directly.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940b27_14']	此品乃明法身理智并普賢行悲智圓滿，舉十方國動故，乃至興供亦圓滿。	此品乃明法身理智并普賢行悲智圓滿，舉十方國動故，乃至興供亦圓滿。	032	This chapter clarifies the Dharma body, wisdom, and the perfect compassion and wisdom of Samantabhadra's practices. Shaking the lands in the ten directions, and even making offerings, is also perfect.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c02_9']	云十方各過八十不可說百千億那由他佛剎微塵數世界外，各有八十不可說百千億那由他佛剎微塵數如來同名普賢，皆現其身而來作證稱歎等事，皆舉八十為量。	云十方各過八十不可說百千億那由他佛剎微塵數世界外，各有八十不可說百千億那由他佛剎微塵數如來同名普賢，皆現其身而來作證稱歎等事，皆舉八十為量。	032	It says that in the worlds beyond the east, west, south, and north, the four intermediate directions, the zenith and nadir, each for eighty unspeakable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of buddha-lands as numerous as the dust particles, there are eighty unspeakable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of tathāgatas from the buddha-lands as numerous as the dust particles, all with the same name Samantabhadra, all manifesting their bodies to come and serve as witnesses, praising and so forth. All take eighty as the measure.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c04_2']	佛號同名普賢者，明以八聖道是佛所行，以所行之行以立佛名號故。	佛號同名普賢者，明以八聖道是佛所行，以所行之行以立佛名號故。	032	The buddhas with the same name Samantabhadra clarify that the eightfold noble path is what the buddhas practice, and the practices they carry out are used to establish the buddhas' names and titles.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c06_1']	此明八聖道覺行齊圓遍十方故，故以八十不可說那由他佛剎微塵數佛同號普賢。	此明八聖道覺行齊圓遍十方故，故以八十不可說那由他佛剎微塵數佛同號普賢。	032	This clarifies that the eightfold noble path is perfectly complete and extends throughout the ten directions, so eighty-inconceivable-number-of-buddha-fields-dust-motes-number buddhas with the same name Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c06_14']	此覺行圓滿，以八聖行為體。	此覺行圓滿，以八聖行為體。	032	This perfect completion of the path of enlightenment takes the eightfold noble path as its essence.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c09_11']	此會中十方佛剎微塵數菩薩摩訶薩得一切神通三昧皆得一生之記者，明既自己修行行果，此是所化之眾故，亦乃一生得記。	此會中十方佛剎微塵數菩薩摩訶薩得一切神通三昧皆得一生之記者，明既自己修行行果，此是所化之眾故，亦乃一生得記。	032	In this assembly, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas as numerous as dust motes in a buddha-field in the ten directions attained the samādhi of all spiritual powers and all attained the prediction of one lifetime, clarifying that since one's own cultivation and fruition of the path are the assembly to be transformed, they too attain the prediction in one lifetime.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c10_9']	一生者，不見三世生故，名為一生義也。	一生者，不見三世生故，名為一生義也。	032	One lifetime means not seeing the arising of the three times, so it is called the meaning of one lifetime.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c11_6']	此乃總攝凡聖元一體相，無別異性。	此乃總攝凡聖元一體相，無別異性。	032	This comprehensively includes ordinary beings and sages as one essence and appearance, without a separate different nature.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c12_10']	以一剎那生入此位者名為一生，更不見三世生性故。	以一剎那生入此位者名為一生，更不見三世生性故。	032	One who enters this stage in a single instant is called one lifetime, because one no longer sees the arising nature of the three times.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c12_20']	實法如是，餘見皆非。	實法如是，餘見皆非。	032	The true Dharma is like this, the rest are all not so.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c17_17']	又佛剎微塵數眾生發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，我亦與受記於當來世經不可說佛剎微塵數劫皆得成佛同號殊勝境界者，明以一剎那中方便三昧顯正智慧海現前時，無邊劫迷一時頓滅，心境解脫，名為佛殊勝境界。	又佛剎微塵數眾生發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，我亦與受記於當來世經不可說佛剎微塵數劫皆得成佛同號殊勝境界者，明以一剎那中方便三昧顯正智慧海現前時，無邊劫迷一時頓滅，心境解脫，名為佛殊勝境界。	032	Moreover, sentient beings as numerous as the dust particles in a buddha-land aroused the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment. I also gave them predictions, saying that in the future, after an ineffable number of eons equal to the number of dust particles in a buddha-land, they will all attain buddhahood and have the same name, 'Supramundane Realm.' This clarifies that when the ocean of correct wisdom appears in a single instant through the samādhi of skillful means, the delusions of boundless eons are instantly extinguished, and the mind and its objects are liberated. This is called the supramundane realm of the buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c18_11']	非如情繫有如許塵劫次第積修。	非如情繫有如許塵劫次第積修。	032	It is not like being bound by emotions, accumulating practices sequentially for as many eons as there are dust particles.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c19_8']	作此解者徒生想慮，未有成佛之期。	作此解者徒生想慮，未有成佛之期。	032	Those who understand this in this way merely give rise to thoughts and plans, and have no hope of attaining buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_032:0940c19_16']	真法中未曾如是。	真法中未曾如是。	032	In the true Dharma, it has never been like this.
