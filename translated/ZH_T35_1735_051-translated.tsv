['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c06_4']	初明來意。	初明來意。	First, clarifying the reason for coming.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c06_9']	來意有三：	來意有三：	There are three reasons:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c07_10']	一分來，前明修因契果生解分，則於法起解；	一分來，前明修因契果生解分，則於法起解；	First, in terms of sections, the previous section on cultivating causes and conforming with fruition clarifies the arising of understanding, which is the arising of understanding of the Dharma;
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c08_13']	今明託法進修成行分，則依解起行，義次第故。	今明託法進修成行分，則依解起行，義次第故。	Now, the section on relying on the Dharma to advance in practice and cultivate practices clarifies the arising of practice based on understanding, thus the sequence of meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c10_9']	二會來者，前會因圓果滿生解之終，此會正行處世無染，通於始終，故次來也。	二會來者，前會因圓果滿生解之終，此會正行處世無染，通於始終，故次來也。	Second, in terms of assemblies, the previous assembly concludes the arising of understanding with the completion of causes and fruition; this assembly is the correct practice of being in the world without defilement, which extends to the beginning and end, thus it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c11_17']	三品來者，前品出現之果殊勝，今明依彼起行圓融，故次來也。	三品來者，前品出現之果殊勝，今明依彼起行圓融，故次來也。	Third, in terms of chapters, the previous chapter on the marvelous fruition of appearance now clarifies the perfect and harmonious practice based on that, thus it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c12_18']	雖一分一會一品是同，所對既殊，來意亦別。	雖一分一會一品是同，所對既殊，來意亦別。	Although the sections, assemblies, and chapters are the same, since the objects they address are different, the reasons for coming are also distinct.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c13_3']	第二釋名。	第二釋名。	Second, explaining the names.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c13_8']	亦有三別：	亦有三別：	There are also three distinctions:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c15_1']	一分名者，沒彼位名，但彰行法，欲顯行位無礙、前後圓融，故以名也。	一分名者，沒彼位名，但彰行法，欲顯行位無礙、前後圓融，故以名也。	As for the name of one part, it is the name that has disappeared from that stage, but only manifests the practice method. It is to show that practice and stage are unobstructed and perfectly integrated before and after, so it uses the name.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c16_6']	二會名者，約法不異分名，約處名三會普光明殿之會。	二會名者，約法不異分名，約處名三會普光明殿之會。	As for the name of the assembly, it is not different from the name of the Dharma. It is named the assembly of the Hall of Universal Light.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c16_17']	第七重會，會終歸始故。	第七重會，會終歸始故。	The seventh assembly, the assembly ends and returns to the beginning.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c17_10']	雖越四天，同為生解之會；	雖越四天，同為生解之會；	Although it goes beyond the four heavens, it is the same as the assembly that gives rise to understanding;
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c18_13']	今復重會，通對彼分始終，依解成行，故會普光。	今復重會，通對彼分始終，依解成行，故會普光。	Now it is assembled again, and in general it faces that division from beginning to end. Relying on understanding to form practice, therefore it assembles in the Hall of Universal Light.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c19_11']	而前分生解差別，故寄歷處以顯淺深；	而前分生解差別，故寄歷處以顯淺深；	But the previous division gives rise to understanding and distinctions, therefore it relies on passing through places to show shallow and deep;
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c21_4']	今分起行圓融，故一會並收因果，亦表成行不離普光明智故。	今分起行圓融，故一會並收因果，亦表成行不離普光明智故。	Now it divides the practice that arises and is perfectly integrated, therefore it completely includes cause and effect in one assembly. It also shows that forming practice is no different from the wisdom of universal light. Therefore.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c22_1']	此中不隔餘處，何有重會之義？	此中不隔餘處，何有重會之義？	In this, it does not separate from other places. How can there be the meaning of assembling again?
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c22_15']	若約次第，前時後時即是重義。	若約次第，前時後時即是重義。	If it is about sequence, then the previous time and the later time is precisely the meaning of assembling again.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c23_16']	若約圓融，就義名重，故不動前二而升四天。	若約圓融，就義名重，故不動前二而升四天。	If we discuss it in terms of perfect interfusion, the meaning of the name is repeated, and therefore one can ascend to the four heavens without moving from the previous two.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c25_12']	二七相望亦何所隔，明知約義亦猶燈光涉入無礙，亦似燈炷重發重明。	二七相望亦何所隔，明知約義亦猶燈光涉入無礙，亦似燈炷重發重明。	The seven stages are also mutually inclusive, just like the unobstructed interpenetration of light and darkness, or like the lamp wick repeatedly producing light.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c26_6']	約人，名普慧普賢問答之會。	約人，名普慧普賢問答之會。	In terms of people, it is the assembly of questions and answers between Samantabhadra and Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c26_12']	三品名有二：	三品名有二：	The three chapters have two names:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c27_1']	一得名、二釋名。	一得名、二釋名。	one is the name and the other is the explanation of the name.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c27_7']	今初，又二：	今初，又二：	The first, again, has two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c27_11']	一異名。	一異名。	one is the different names.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c27_21']	下文十義，至彼當辨。	下文十義，至彼當辨。	The ten meanings in the following text will be discussed there.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0887c28_13']	有別行本名度世經，度即離義。	有別行本名度世經，度即離義。	There is a separate edition called the Sutra of Crossing the World, where crossing means the meaning of leaving.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a01_2']	又有別行名普賢菩薩答難二千經，此就能離人法受稱。	又有別行名普賢菩薩答難二千經，此就能離人法受稱。	There is also a separate edition called the Sutra of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva Answering Questions in Two Thousand, which is named after the person and Dharma who can leave.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a02_2']	二正辨本稱，總由超絕世染故受其名。	二正辨本稱，總由超絕世染故受其名。	The second is the correct explanation of the original name, which is generally named after transcending worldly defilements.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a02_7']	別有三義：	別有三義：	There are three specific meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a02_19']	一約法、二約行、三約位。	一約法、二約行、三約位。	one is in terms of Dharma, the second is in terms of practice, and the third is in terms of stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a03_10']	約法之中，先世、後離世。	約法之中，先世、後離世。	In terms of Dharma, first the world and then leaving the world.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a03_14']	有三類：	有三類：	There are three categories:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a04_16']	一約事相有二世間，謂器及有情，此約依正分之。	一約事相有二世間，謂器及有情，此約依正分之。	First, in terms of phenomena, there are two kinds of worlds: the world of the container and the world of sentient beings. This is divided in terms of the environment and beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a05_4']	二約麁細亦二：	二約麁細亦二：	Second, in terms of coarse and fine, there are also two:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a06_7']	一有為世間、二無為世間，此約分段、變易分之。	一有為世間、二無為世間，此約分段、變易分之。	The conditioned world and the unconditioned world. This is divided in terms of the compounded and the uncompounded.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a07_1']	以變易非三有攝，名之無為。	以變易非三有攝，名之無為。	Because the uncompounded is not included in the three realms of existence, it is called unconditioned.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a07_18']	故《勝鬘》云「有為生死，無為生死。	故《勝鬘》云「有為生死，無為生死。	Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says, The conditioned cycle of birth and death, and the unconditioned cycle of birth and death.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a08_6']	」然麁細雖殊，體不出二。	」然麁細雖殊，體不出二。	However, although coarse and fine differ, their essence does not go beyond the two.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a08_13']	三約染淨有三：	三約染淨有三：	Third, in terms of defiled and pure, there are three:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a10_1']	於初二中，加智正覺示同世間，不同世故，如《地論》辨。	於初二中，加智正覺示同世間，不同世故，如《地論》辨。	Within the first two, adding wisdom and right enlightenment shows the same as the world, but not the same as the world. Therefore, it is explained like the Treatise on the Stages of Yoga Practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a10_11']	二明離者，離有二義：	二明離者，離有二義：	Second, clarifying detachment. There are two meanings of detachment:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a11_6']	一性離，世間性空即是出世間故；	一性離，世間性空即是出世間故；	First, the meaning of inherent detachment. The nature of the world is empty, which is precisely transcending the world.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a11_17']	二明事離，行成無染故。	二明事離，行成無染故。	Second, the meaning of manifest detachment. Because practice is accomplished without defilement.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a12_15']	力林頌云「三世五蘊法，說名為世間。	力林頌云「三世五蘊法，說名為世間。	The verse in the Forest of Merit Sutra says, The dharmas of the five aggregates in the three times are called the world.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a13_7']	彼滅非世間，如是但假名。	彼滅非世間，如是但假名。	Their cessation is not of the world, thus it is only a provisional name.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a14_13']	」滅通二義，於事離中有似離真離、分離全離，次下當辨。	」滅通二義，於事離中有似離真離、分離全離，次下當辨。	Cessation is common to both meanings. In terms of phenomena, there is partial cessation and true cessation, cessation of separation and complete cessation, which will be explained below.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a15_3']	二約行者，略為四句：	二約行者，略為四句：	Second, in terms of the practitioner, there are roughly four statements:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a15_15']	一隨、二離、三俱、四泯。	一隨、二離、三俱、四泯。	First, following; second, separation; third, both; fourth, negation.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a16_9']	言隨者，凡夫沈溺世蘊，非離非隨。	言隨者，凡夫沈溺世蘊，非離非隨。	As for following, ordinary beings are immersed in worldly aggregates, neither separated nor following.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a17_6']	二乘無悲不能隨世，雖離非真。	二乘無悲不能隨世，雖離非真。	Those of the two vehicles lack compassion and cannot follow the world, although they are separated, it is not true.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a18_3']	菩薩能隨，方為真離，故以隨釋離。	菩薩能隨，方為真離，故以隨釋離。	Bodhisattvas are able to follow, which is truly separation, therefore following is used to explain separation.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a19_6']	二離者，有大智故了世性離，處而不染亦異凡小。	二離者，有大智故了世性離，處而不染亦異凡小。	Second, as for separation, because of great wisdom, one understands the nature of the world to be separated, abiding in it without defilement, also different from ordinary beings and the two vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a20_5']	三俱者，悲故常行世間，智故不染世法。	三俱者，悲故常行世間，智故不染世法。	Third, as for both, because of compassion, one always practices in the world; because of wisdom, one is not defiled by worldly dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a21_11']	既以世與性離無二為其境，故以悲智無二為其行。	既以世與性離無二為其境，故以悲智無二為其行。	Since the world and its nature are non-dual as the realm, therefore compassion and wisdom are non-dual as practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a22_2']	境行融通有其三句：	境行融通有其三句：	The realm and practice interpenetrate in three statements:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a23_6']	一悲無不智，則世無不離，是以常在世間未曾不出。	一悲無不智，則世無不離，是以常在世間未曾不出。	First, compassion without wisdom is not worldly detachment, therefore it is always in the world and never does not appear.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a24_13']	二智無不悲故，離無不世，是以恒越世表，無不遊世。	二智無不悲故，離無不世，是以恒越世表，無不遊世。	Second, wisdom without compassion is not worldly detachment, therefore it is always beyond the world and does not not wander in the world.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a25_13']	三雙融故動靜無二，唯是一念，所謂無念。	三雙融故動靜無二，唯是一念，所謂無念。	Third, because they are both fused, movement and stillness are not two, it is only one thought, namely no thought.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a26_6']	無念等故，世與出世無有障礙。	無念等故，世與出世無有障礙。	Because no thought is equal, the world and the supramundane are unobstructed.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a27_18']	四俱泯者，謂境既世與性離，形奪兩亡，故令悲智俱融，二念雙絕。	四俱泯者，謂境既世與性離，形奪兩亡，故令悲智俱融，二念雙絕。	Fourth, the obliteration of both means that since the object is both worldly and detached from nature, they negate each other and both disappear, thus causing compassion and wisdom to be fused and the two thoughts to be completely severed.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a28_17']	又由境行相由，形奪齊離，則絕待離言。	又由境行相由，形奪齊離，則絕待離言。	Moreover, because the object and practice are mutually dependent, they are equally detached, thus transcending dependence and being inexpressible.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888a29_15']	融前四句皆無障礙，方為真離世間也。	融前四句皆無障礙，方為真離世間也。	Fusing the previous four statements into all being unobstructed is precisely true worldly detachment.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b02_13']	三約位者，凡夫染而非離，二乘分離非真，謂果離分段、因唯事離，非今所明。	三約位者，凡夫染而非離，二乘分離非真，謂果離分段、因唯事離，非今所明。	Third, regarding the stages, ordinary beings are defiled and not detached, while the two vehicles are detached and not true. The result is detached from the compounded, and the cause is only detached from phenomena, which is not what is being discussed now.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b03_11']	菩薩具上真行，可得名離，而非究竟。	菩薩具上真行，可得名離，而非究竟。	Bodhisattvas who possess the above true practices can be called liberated, but not ultimately so.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b04_13']	唯佛為離，故經云「佛常在世間，而不染世法。	唯佛為離，故經云「佛常在世間，而不染世法。	Only the Buddha is truly liberated, thus the sutra says, The Buddha always abides in the world without being tainted by worldly dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b06_13']	」然今文中備六位之行即是行離，行所依位即是位離，故若事若理、若因若果皆名離也。	」然今文中備六位之行即是行離，行所依位即是位離，故若事若理、若因若果皆名離也。	However, the practices of the six stages in this text are precisely the liberation through practice, and the stages upon which the practices are based are precisely the liberation through stages. Therefore, both phenomena and principle, both causes and effects, are called liberation.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b07_9']	二釋名者，約法事離，無他受稱。	二釋名者，約法事離，無他受稱。	Second, in terms of explaining the names, in terms of the liberation from phenomena and events, there is no other name to be given.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b07_19']	離非世間，即相違釋。	離非世間，即相違釋。	Liberation from the non-worldly is a contradictory explanation.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b08_9']	若約性離，通持業釋。	若約性離，通持業釋。	If in terms of the liberation of nature, it is a general explanation of the dependent arising of attributes.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b09_12']	約行四句，前三句俱通持業、相違二，事理離故。	約行四句，前三句俱通持業、相違二，事理離故。	In terms of practice, there are four statements. The first three statements are both general explanations of the dependent arising of attributes and contradictory explanations, because of the liberation from phenomena and principle.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b09_19']	泯句並非六釋。	泯句並非六釋。	The statement of subsuming is not any of the six explanations.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b10_9']	亦可持業，泯即離故。	亦可持業，泯即離故。	It can also be an explanation of the dependent arising of attributes, because subsuming is precisely liberation.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b10_14']	第三宗趣。	第三宗趣。	Third, the purport.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b12_1']	頓彰六位理事二離為宗，令體性離頓成真離究竟為趣。	頓彰六位理事二離為宗，令體性離頓成真離究竟為趣。	The purport is to suddenly manifest the two liberations of phenomena and principle in the six stages, and to take the essence of liberation as the ultimate liberation.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b12_6']	第四釋文。	第四釋文。	Fourth, explaining the text.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b14_16']	長科十分，一序分、二三昧分、三發起分、四起分、五請分、六說分、七結勸分、八現瑞分、九證成分、十重頌分。	長科十分，一序分、二三昧分、三發起分、四起分、五請分、六說分、七結勸分、八現瑞分、九證成分、十重頌分。	The text is divided into ten sections: 1. Introduction, 2. Samādhi section, 3. Arising section, 4. Arousing section, 5. Request section, 6. Teaching section, 7. Conclusion and exhortation section, 8. Auspicious signs section, 9. Attainment section, 10. Verses section.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b15_1']	今初，有三：	今初，有三：	Now, the first part has three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b15_13']	一器世間圓滿，義如前釋。	一器世間圓滿，義如前釋。	First, the perfect world of the vessel, the meaning is as explained above.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b16_5']	二「妙悟」下智正覺世間圓滿。	二「妙悟」下智正覺世間圓滿。	Second, from wonderful realization below, the perfect world of wisdom and right enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b17_1']	「與三不可說」下眾生世間圓滿。	「與三不可說」下眾生世間圓滿。	Below together with the three inexpressibles, the perfect world of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b18_10']	二中明佛二十一種殊勝功德，廣引諸論，已見〈升兜率品〉。	二中明佛二十一種殊勝功德，廣引諸論，已見〈升兜率品〉。	In the second, it clarifies the Buddha's twenty-one kinds of supreme merits, extensively citing various treatises, which have already been seen in the Ascending to Tuṣita Heaven Chapter.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b19_14']	今但略明，初句為總，具下二十一種功德，故云妙悟皆滿。	今但略明，初句為總，具下二十一種功德，故云妙悟皆滿。	Now, it is only briefly explained. The first sentence is the general, which is endowed with the following twenty-one kinds of merits, therefore it says wonderful realization is completely fulfilled.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b20_2']	後「二行」下別。	後「二行」下別。	Below the two practices, it is specific.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b20_15']	於中，前四自利、餘皆利他。	於中，前四自利、餘皆利他。	Among them, the first four are self-benefit, the rest are all benefiting others.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b21_16']	前中，一智德、二斷德、三恩德、四作用平等德。	前中，一智德、二斷德、三恩德、四作用平等德。	The first of these is the merit of wisdom, the second is the merit of elimination, the third is the merit of kindness, and the fourth is the merit of the equality of function.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b22_15']	今初，二行永絕，即於所知一向無障轉功德。	今初，二行永絕，即於所知一向無障轉功德。	Now, the first two are the eternal cessation of the two practices, which is the merit of unimpeded transformation in regard to the knowable.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b23_7']	《佛地經》名不二現行。	《佛地經》名不二現行。	The Buddha Land Sutra calls it the non-dual practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_051:0888b23_22']	「不」字，此宜言無，即永絕義。	「不」字，此宜言無，即永絕義。	The character not here should be said to be no, which is the meaning of eternal cessation.
