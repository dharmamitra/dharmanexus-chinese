For example, compassion saves the nine categories of beings, and wisdom understands non-arising. Those who can be saved are exclusively benefiting others.
['ZH_T36_1736_038:0290a28_2']	有悲無智即墮愛見，有智無悲即滯二乘。	有悲無智即墮愛見，有智無悲即滯二乘。	038	Having compassion without wisdom falls into love and views, and having wisdom without compassion is stuck in the two vehicles.

['ZH_T36_1736_038:0290b02_2']	然前釋樂住生死具悲智二意，今為對遠離義，故但舉悲，故樂住生死。	然前釋樂住生死具悲智二意，今為對遠離義，故但舉悲，故樂住生死。	038	However, the previous explanation of delighting in abiding in samsara includes both compassion and wisdom. Now, in contrast to the meaning of far-reaching detachment, only compassion is mentioned, therefore delighting in abiding in samsara.
