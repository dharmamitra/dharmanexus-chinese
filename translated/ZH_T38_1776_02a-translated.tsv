['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a17_16']	然此句中念待聖問，非念為病，良以維摩悲物情深、待化如渴，故興此念。	然此句中念待聖問，非念為病，良以維摩悲物情深、待化如渴，故興此念。	02a	However, in this sentence, the thought of waiting for the sage's question is not the illness. It is because Vimalakīrti's compassion for beings is deep and his desire to transform them is like thirst, so he gives rise to this thought.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a19_19']	維摩現病專情為物，心雖為物，得佛影響化事方成，故念自己「寢疾于床，世尊大慈寧不垂愍」。	維摩現病專情為物，心雖為物，得佛影響化事方成，故念自己「寢疾于床，世尊大慈寧不垂愍」。	02a	Vimalakīrti's illness is focused on beings, and although his mind is for beings, he can only attain the Buddha's influence and transform matters. Therefore, he thinks, I am lying sick in bed, and the World-Honored One's great compassion will surely not fail to take pity on me.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a20_12']	病為慈境，故念自己寢疾于床。	病為慈境，故念自己寢疾于床。	02a	Since illness is the realm of compassion, he thinks of himself as lying sick in bed.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a21_2']	愍苦唯佛，故念世尊。	愍苦唯佛，故念世尊。	02a	Only the Buddha has pity on suffering, so he thinks of the World-Honored One.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a21_17']	佛有深慈，於苦多憐，故念大悲。	佛有深慈，於苦多憐，故念大悲。	02a	The Buddha has profound compassion, and has pity on those who suffer, so he thinks of great compassion.

['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a24_16']	我今病苦，安能忍此而不垂愍。	我今病苦，安能忍此而不垂愍。	02a	I am now suffering from illness, how can I endure this without his pity?

['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a28_1']	解有三義：	解有三義：	02a	There are three meanings in the explanation:
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a28_17']	一、為彰如來心等不偏，所以通告。	一、為彰如來心等不偏，所以通告。	02a	First, to show that the Tathāgata's mind is impartial, therefore he announces it to all.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445a29_9']	與《涅槃》中普告大眾令問相似。	與《涅槃》中普告大眾令問相似。	02a	Similar to the announcement in the Nirvana Sutra to the great assembly to ask questions.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b01_9', 'ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b01_19']	第二為欲廣寄眾言顯維摩德，故須通告。🔽告命不堪，彰其德高；	第二為欲廣寄眾言顯維摩德，故須通告。 告命不堪，彰其德高；	02a	Second, in order to widely entrust the words of the assembly to manifest the virtue of Vimalakīrti, therefore he must announce it to all.🔽Announcing the inability shows his lofty virtue;
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b02_8']	告命堪者，顯其德妙。	告命堪者，顯其德妙。	02a	Announcing the ability shows his subtle virtue.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b03_11']	第三為欲廣寄眾言以顯維摩所說之法，故須通告。	第三為欲廣寄眾言以顯維摩所說之法，故須通告。	02a	Third, in order to widely entrust the words of the assembly to manifest the Dharma spoken by Vimalakīrti, therefore he must announce it to all.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b04_14']	故下文中先告不堪彰昔所說，後告所堪明今所說。	故下文中先告不堪彰昔所說，後告所堪明今所說。	02a	Therefore, in the text below, first announcing the inability shows what was spoken in the past, then announcing the ability clarifies what is spoken now.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b05_13']	等是通告，以何義故先告不堪、後告堪者？	等是通告，以何義故先告不堪、後告堪者？	02a	This is the same as the announcement to all. Why is it that he first announces the inability and then the ability?
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b05_18']	解有兩義：	解有兩義：	02a	There are two meanings to understanding:
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b07_3']	一者欲次第等告令問，成上三義，以是義故先告不堪；	一者欲次第等告令問，成上三義，以是義故先告不堪；	02a	First, wanting to announce in order, to make them ask, to accomplish the above three meanings. For this reason, he first announced the incapable ones;
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b07_17']	若先告堪，後則無宜告不堪者。	若先告堪，後則無宜告不堪者。	02a	If he first announced the capable ones, then it would not be appropriate to later announce the incapable ones.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b09_15']	第二為欲約對不堪顯後能問，所問人高、所說必深，令人渴仰，以是義故先告不堪。	第二為欲約對不堪顯後能問，所問人高、所說必深，令人渴仰，以是義故先告不堪。	02a	Second, wanting to clarify the later able ones by contrasting with the incapable ones. The person who is asked is lofty, and what is said must be profound, causing people to yearn for it. For this reason, he first announced the incapable ones.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b10_9']	告不堪中，先告聲聞、後告菩薩。	告不堪中，先告聲聞、後告菩薩。	02a	In announcing the incapable ones, he first announced the śrāvakas and then the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b11_3']	如來熟知聲聞不堪，何勞通告？	如來熟知聲聞不堪，何勞通告？	02a	The Tathāgata was well aware that the śrāvakas were incapable, so why bother to announce it to them?
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b11_8']	解二有三：	解二有三：	02a	There are three explanations for this:
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b12_13']	第一為顯佛心平等，與《涅槃》中先告比丘令問相似。	第一為顯佛心平等，與《涅槃》中先告比丘令問相似。	02a	First, wanting to show that the Buddha's mind is impartial, similar to in the Nirvana Sutra where he first announced to the bhikṣus to ask questions.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b13_11']	第二為欲廣對眾人顯維摩德，故須通告。	第二為欲廣對眾人顯維摩德，故須通告。	02a	Second, wanting to widely contrast with the multitude of people to show the virtue of Vimalakīrti, therefore he must announce it to all.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b14_14']	故下文中先告聲聞，對之以顯維摩德高超出二乘；	故下文中先告聲聞，對之以顯維摩德高超出二乘；	02a	Thus, in the text below, he first announced to the śrāvakas, contrasting them to show that Vimalakīrti's virtue surpasses the two vehicles;
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b15_12']	後告菩薩，對之以顯維摩德高過諸菩薩。	後告菩薩，對之以顯維摩德高過諸菩薩。	02a	Later, he announced to the bodhisattvas, confronting them to show that Vimalakīrti's virtue surpassed that of all the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b16_16']	第三為欲廣寄眾言以顯維摩所說之法，故須通告。	第三為欲廣寄眾言以顯維摩所說之法，故須通告。	02a	Third, in order to extensively entrust the words of the assembly to show the Dharma that Vimalakīrti spoke, it is necessary to announce it to all.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b17_15']	故下文中先告聲聞，明其所說教聲聞法；	故下文中先告聲聞，明其所說教聲聞法；	02a	Therefore, in the text below, he first announced to the śrāvakas, clarifying the Dharma he spoke that teaches the śrāvakas;
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b18_10']	後告菩薩，明其所說教菩薩法。	後告菩薩，明其所說教菩薩法。	02a	Later, he announced to the bodhisattvas, clarifying the Dharma he spoke that teaches the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b19_9']	等是通告，以何義故先告聲聞、後告菩薩？	等是通告，以何義故先告聲聞、後告菩薩？	02a	This is all the announcement. For what meaning does he first announce to the śrāvakas and later announce to the bodhisattvas?
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b19_14']	解有三義：	解有三義：	02a	There are three explanations:
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b20_4']	一聲聞近佛，隨近先告；	一聲聞近佛，隨近先告；	02a	First, the śrāvakas are close to the Buddha, and he announces to them first according to their closeness;
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b20_14']	菩薩不爾，為是後告。	菩薩不爾，為是後告。	02a	The bodhisattvas are not like this, so he announces to them later.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b22_2']	第二為欲聲聞菩薩等告令問，成前三義，以是義故先告聲聞；	第二為欲聲聞菩薩等告令問，成前三義，以是義故先告聲聞；	02a	Second, in order to announce to the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas equally, to form the previous three meanings, for this meaning he first announces to the śrāvakas;
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b23_6']	若使如來先告菩薩，後則無宜更告聲聞，以彼劣故。	若使如來先告菩薩，後則無宜更告聲聞，以彼劣故。	02a	If he had the Tathāgata first announce to the bodhisattvas, later it would not be appropriate to further announce to the śrāvakas, because they are inferior.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b26_15']	第三義者約法次第，前品之中明教凡法從凡至聖，故此品中次告聲聞，對之以顯教聲聞法從小至大，故至後品方告菩薩，對之以顯教菩薩法化法應爾。	第三義者約法次第，前品之中明教凡法從凡至聖，故此品中次告聲聞，對之以顯教聲聞法從小至大，故至後品方告菩薩，對之以顯教菩薩法化法應爾。	02a	The third meaning is in terms of the sequence of the Dharma. In the previous chapter, it clarifies the Dharma for teaching ordinary beings, from the ordinary to the holy. Therefore, in this chapter, it next addresses the śrāvakas, using them to show the Dharma for teaching the śrāvakas, from the small to the great. Therefore, it reaches the later chapters to address the bodhisattvas, using them to show the Dharma for teaching the bodhisattvas, transforming the Dharma should be like this.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b27_20']	就此品中，所告聲聞凡有五百，前十別列，餘悉總舉。	就此品中，所告聲聞凡有五百，前十別列，餘悉總舉。	02a	In this chapter, there are five hundred śrāvakas who are addressed. The first ten are listed separately, the rest are all mentioned collectively.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445b29_3']	就前十中，對初九人明法身因，對後一人明法身果。	就前十中，對初九人明法身因，對後一人明法身果。	02a	Among the first ten, in relation to the first nine people, it clarifies the causes of the Dharma body, in relation to the last person, it clarifies the fruition of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445c01_6']	就前九中，對初八人明修行法，對後一人明出家法。	就前九中，對初八人明修行法，對後一人明出家法。	02a	Among the first nine, in relation to the first eight people, it clarifies the Dharma of cultivation, in relation to the last person, it clarifies the Dharma of leaving the home life.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445c02_10']	就前八中，對前七人明修善法，對後一人彰滅惡法。	就前八中，對前七人明修善法，對後一人彰滅惡法。	02a	Among the first eight, in relation to the first seven people, it clarifies the cultivation of wholesome dharmas, in relation to the last person, it reveals the Dharma of extinguishing unwholesome dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445c03_13']	就前七中，對前六人明修道行，對後一人明起通行。	就前七中，對前六人明修道行，對後一人明起通行。	02a	Among the first seven, in relation to the first six people, it clarifies the cultivation of the path, in relation to the last person, it clarifies the arising of the practice of the path.
['ZH_T38_1776_02a:0445c04_3']	修道行體，起通行用。	修道行體，起通行用。	02a	The essence of the cultivation of the path is the arising of the function of the practice of the path.
