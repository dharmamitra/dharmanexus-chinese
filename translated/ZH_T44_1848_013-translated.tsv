['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c03_6']	以有境界緣故。	以有境界緣故。	013	Because there are objective conditions,
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c03_12']	復生六種相。	復生六種相。	013	Six kinds of characteristics arise again.

['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c09_8']	即同衣等。	即同衣等。	013	then it would be the same as clothes, etc.,
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c09_13']	是可思議。	是可思議。	013	which is conceivable.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c09_20']	即是凡夫所見。	即是凡夫所見。	013	This is what ordinary beings see.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c10_7']	若一向不可熏變。	若一向不可熏變。	013	If it is entirely unsusceptible to permeation and transformation,
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c10_12']	即如玉石。	即如玉石。	013	then it would be like jade and stone,

['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c11_5']	便同權教所說。	便同權教所說。	013	This would be the same as what is taught in the provisional teachings.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c11_16']	今以俱非此二故不思議。	今以俱非此二故不思議。	013	Now, because it is neither of these two, it is inconceivable.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c12_6']	三廣釋經義二。	三廣釋經義二。	013	Third, extensively explaining the meaning of the sutra, there are two parts.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c12_13']	初細中二因三。	初細中二因三。	013	First, the two causes in the subtle, there are three.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c13_1']	初解云下正釋。	初解云下正釋。	013	First, the explanation below is the correct explanation.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c13_8']	言不可熏等者。	言不可熏等者。	013	It says unsusceptible to permeation and so on.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c14_7']	以自性清淨心從本已來不與妄染相應故。	以自性清淨心從本已來不與妄染相應故。	013	Because the originally pure mind has always been unassociated with deluded defilements.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c14_17']	又無明之法本性虛妄。	又無明之法本性虛妄。	013	Moreover, the dharma of ignorance is originally false by nature.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c15_5']	今以虛妄之法。	今以虛妄之法。	013	Now, using this false dharma,
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c15_14']	而能熏動性靜之體。	而能熏動性靜之體。	013	one is able to permeate and agitate the still essence.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c16_4']	是不可熏處而熏也。	是不可熏處而熏也。	013	This is permeating where one is unsusceptible to permeation.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c16_11']	言熏則不熏者。	言熏則不熏者。	013	It says permeation is not permeation.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c17_4']	雖熏真如而真如性且不動。	雖熏真如而真如性且不動。	013	Although it permeates true suchness, the nature of true suchness remains unmoved.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c17_17']	又此無明體全是覺一相無異。	又此無明體全是覺一相無異。	013	Moreover, the essence of this ignorance is entirely the one characteristic of enlightenment, without difference.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c18_7']	將何以為能熏所熏。	將何以為能熏所熏。	013	What can be used as the perfumer and the perfumed?
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c18_17']	雖無能所而現法宛然。	雖無能所而現法宛然。	013	Although there is no perfumer and perfumed, the present dharma is still clearly manifest.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c19_5']	故云不熏之熏。	故云不熏之熏。	013	Therefore, it is said to be the perfuming of that which is not perfumable.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c19_13']	言不可變而變者。	言不可變而變者。	013	As for the phrase that which cannot be transformed yet transforms,
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c19_18']	夫真如者。	夫真如者。	013	the true suchness
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c20_4']	是無變異義。	是無變異義。	013	is the meaning of immutability.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c20_9']	本不合變。	本不合變。	013	It originally does not accord with transformation,
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c21_1']	而受無明熏之成變動故。	而受無明熏之成變動故。	013	yet it receives the perfuming of ignorance and becomes transformed.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c21_6']	變動相者。	變動相者。	013	The characteristic of transformation
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c21_11']	即業相等。	即業相等。	013	is the characteristic of karma and so forth.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c21_19']	是又變即不變者。	是又變即不變者。	013	Moreover, transformation is precisely non-transformation.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c22_9']	雖動成識相而性淨無改。	雖動成識相而性淨無改。	013	Although movement forms the characteristics of consciousness, its pure nature does not change.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c23_1']	雖性無改而全體見動。	雖性無改而全體見動。	013	Although its nature does not change, its entire essence is seen to move.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c23_11']	如水成波而濕性不變。	如水成波而濕性不變。	013	It is like water becoming waves, yet the wet nature does not change.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c24_1']	濕雖不變而全體動。	濕雖不變而全體動。	013	Although wetness does not change, its entire essence moves.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c24_8']	故云不變之變。	故云不變之變。	013	Therefore, it is said to be the transformation of that which does not transform.
['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c25_8']	勝鬘下二引經證同。	勝鬘下二引經證同。	013	The following two citations from the sutras prove the same point.

['ZH_T44_1848_013:0364c29_2']	以能熏是無明之妄。	以能熏是無明之妄。	013	Because the perfumer is the delusion of ignorance.
