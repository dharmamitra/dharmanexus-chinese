['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b08_13']	兩成尊重故，　　由等流殊勝；	兩成尊重故，　　由等流殊勝；	Because both are respected, by the superior of the same outflow;
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b09_13']	煩惱因性故，　　由劣亦勝故。	煩惱因性故，　　由劣亦勝故。	Because of the nature of the cause of afflictions, by the inferior and also the superior.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b10_18']	言「兩成尊重」者，由所託處成制底塔故。	言「兩成尊重」者，由所託處成制底塔故。	As for both are respected, it is because the place where it is relied upon becomes a caitya.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b13_1']	謂是說法之地，其所依身成如大師尊重性故，即是持經之人施寶之地，及能施者無如是事故。	謂是說法之地，其所依身成如大師尊重性故，即是持經之人施寶之地，及能施者無如是事故。	It is said that this is the ground where the Dharma is spoken, and the body that relies on it becomes the nature of respect like the Great Teacher, therefore, the person who upholds the sūtra is the ground for giving treasures, and the one who is able to give does not have such a matter.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b14_4']	次下經文，顯此法門乃是諸佛親所證會等流之性。	次下經文，顯此法門乃是諸佛親所證會等流之性。	The following sūtra text shows that this Dharma door is the nature of the same outflow that is personally realized by the Buddhas.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b15_1']	「頗曾有法是如來說不」者，此明何意？	「頗曾有法是如來說不」者，此明何意？	Has there ever been a Dharma that was spoken by the Tathāgata? What does this clarify?
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b16_1']	言無有法是如來獨說，皆是諸佛共宣揚故。	言無有法是如來獨說，皆是諸佛共宣揚故。	It is said that there is no Dharma that only the Tathāgata alone teaches, because it is all that is proclaimed in common by the buddhas.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b19_19']	又此施珍寶福是苦惱事生起之因，法門功德乃是煩惑斷除之要，優劣懸隔，是故下文將地塵為喻，如來說作非塵，由此說為地塵；	又此施珍寶福是苦惱事生起之因，法門功德乃是煩惑斷除之要，優劣懸隔，是故下文將地塵為喻，如來說作非塵，由此說為地塵；	Moreover, the merit of this generosity of precious jewels is the cause for the arising of suffering and distress, while the merit of the Dharma gate is the essential method for eliminating afflictions and delusions. The difference is vast. Therefore, the text below uses the analogy of particles of earth. The Tathāgata says they are not particles, and for this reason they are called particles of earth;
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b21_4']	所言世界，如來說為非界，由此說為世界者，此有何意？	所言世界，如來說為非界，由此說為世界者，此有何意？	As for the term world, the Tathāgata says it is not a realm, and for this reason it is called a world. What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b22_3']	言此地塵不是染等性塵，是故名作地塵。	言此地塵不是染等性塵，是故名作地塵。	It is said that these particles of earth are not the particles of the nature of defilement, and for this reason they are called particles of earth.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b23_4']	又彼世界非是煩惱之因名界，為此說為世界。	又彼世界非是煩惱之因名界，為此說為世界。	Moreover, that world is not the cause of afflictions and is called a realm, and for this reason it is called a world.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b23_16']	界是因義，即是世之因也。	界是因義，即是世之因也。	Realm means the meaning of cause, which is the cause of the world.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b26_5']	斯言意顯彼福乃是煩惑塵坌之因，由其外塵雖是無記，彼福縱善方之極卑，況並成佛福因而不更為微劣？	斯言意顯彼福乃是煩惑塵坌之因，由其外塵雖是無記，彼福縱善方之極卑，況並成佛福因而不更為微劣？	The meaning of these words is evident: that merit is the cause of the dust and defilements of afflictions. Although those external dust [objects] are indeterminate, even if that merit is good, it is still extremely low compared to [the merit of upholding the Dharma]. How much more so for the merit of upholding the Dharma, which is the cause of Buddha-hood, and yet is still considered inferior?
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b27_16']	又彼能成大丈夫相所有福業，󰁨此成菩提因持說法門之福亦為是劣。	又彼能成大丈夫相所有福業，󰁨此成菩提因持說法門之福亦為是劣。	Moreover, the meritorious karma that can create the physical characteristics of a great man, compared to the merit of upholding and expounding the Dharma, which is the cause of attaining enlightenment, is also inferior.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878b29_8']	由彼眾相非是正覺之體性故，為此名為大丈夫相，是彼標相故。	由彼眾相非是正覺之體性故，為此名為大丈夫相，是彼標相故。	Because those various characteristics are not the essence of perfect enlightenment, they are called the physical characteristics of a great man, because they are the characteristics that indicate him.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c03_1']	由持說福能得大覺性，為此名劣，亦勝過施寶之福，況法身因而不超越，是故劣亦勝也，即是寶福極卑為能成立因。	由持說福能得大覺性，為此名劣，亦勝過施寶之福，況法身因而不超越，是故劣亦勝也，即是寶福極卑為能成立因。	Because the merit of upholding and expounding can attain the essence of great enlightenment, it is called inferior, and yet it surpasses the merit of giving treasures. How much more so for the cause of the Dharma body, which transcends [the merit of giving]? Therefore, it is inferior and yet superior. This means that the merit of giving treasures is extremely low, and yet it is the cause that can establish [the Dharma body].
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c04_8']	此既成立施寶之福與此福因有差別已，次下諸文更復成立。	此既成立施寶之福與此福因有差別已，次下諸文更復成立。	Since it has already been established that the merit of giving treasures and this meritorious cause are different, the following passages further establish this.

['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c05_0']	彼果勝苦故，　　難逢勝事故，	彼果勝苦故，　　難逢勝事故，	Because its fruit is superior suffering, it is difficult to encounter and has superior significance,
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c06_0']	境岸非知故，　　於餘不共故，	境岸非知故，　　於餘不共故，	Because its object is not known, and because it is not shared with others,
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c07_0']	是甚深性故，　　勝餘略詮故，	是甚深性故，　　勝餘略詮故，	Because it is the nature of the profound, and because it surpasses other brief explanations,
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c08_13']	胄族高勝故，　　望福福殊勝。	胄族高勝故，　　望福福殊勝。	Because its lineage is superior, and because its merit is superior to that of merit.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c09_4']	此述何義？	此述何義？	What meaning does this describe?
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c09_6']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c10_4']	施寶之福獲得自身所受用果，彼身是勝。	施寶之福獲得自身所受用果，彼身是勝。	The merit of giving jewels obtains the fruit of what is enjoyed by the body. That body is superior.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c11_16']	以能捨彼無邊之身，此福勝前，由彼自身是苦性故，何況為彼而行其施。	以能捨彼無邊之身，此福勝前，由彼自身是苦性故，何況為彼而行其施。	Because one can abandon that boundless body, this merit surpasses the previous, because that body itself is of the nature of suffering, let alone practicing giving for it.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c13_5']	爾時具壽妙生，了彼自身是苦事故，由法勢力遂便墮淚。	爾時具壽妙生，了彼自身是苦事故，由法勢力遂便墮淚。	At that time, the Venerable Subhūti, understanding that his own body is of the nature of suffering, by the power of the Dharma, then shed tears.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c13_14']	此之法門復是難逢。	此之法門復是難逢。	This Dharma door is also difficult to encounter.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c15_3']	妙生自從生智已來，亦未曾聞，復是勝事，此言欲顯般若之名。	妙生自從生智已來，亦未曾聞，復是勝事，此言欲顯般若之名。	Subhūti, ever since he attained wisdom, has never heard it before, and it is also a superior matter. This statement wishes to manifest the name of prajñā.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c16_19']	此下意欲成立是勝妙事，即經云「如來說為般若波羅蜜多者，彼即非波羅蜜多」。	此下意欲成立是勝妙事，即經云「如來說為般若波羅蜜多者，彼即非波羅蜜多」。	Below this, the intention is to establish this as a supreme and wonderful matter. The sutra says, What the Tathagata calls prajnaparamita is not a paramita.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c17_8']	為何意趣作如是說？	為何意趣作如是說？	What is the underlying meaning of saying this?
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c17_10']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c17_16']	境岸非知故。	境岸非知故。	Because the other shore of objects is not known.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c19_1']	由其所知境岸，除佛於餘無能知者，復是於餘不共故。	由其所知境岸，除佛於餘無能知者，復是於餘不共故。	Because the other shore of objects to be known, except for the Buddha, there is no one who can know it, and it is also because it is not shared with others.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c20_4']	此之法門所有實想即實想者，除佛教已餘處無故。	此之法門所有實想即實想者，除佛教已餘處無故。	This Dharma gate, all true thoughts are true thoughts, because except for the Buddha's teachings, they do not exist elsewhere.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c22_8']	言實想者唯此處有，言非實者是於餘不生義，是故文云「若能生如是想者，彼當成就第一希有」。	言實想者唯此處有，言非實者是於餘不生義，是故文云「若能生如是想者，彼當成就第一希有」。	As for true thoughts, they exist only in this place. As for non-true thoughts, they are the meaning of not arising elsewhere. Therefore, the text says, If one can give rise to such thoughts, they will attain the first rarity.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c23_17']	又此法門亦是甚深，由於此經或少受或遍持，於我等想不復生起。	又此法門亦是甚深，由於此經或少受或遍持，於我等想不復生起。	Moreover, this Dharma gate is also very profound. Because in this sutra, whether one receives a little or upholds it completely, thoughts of self and others will no longer arise.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c24_18']	「於我等想不生故」者，明於所取義無有顛倒。	「於我等想不生故」者，明於所取義無有顛倒。	Because the notion of self does not arise clarifies the absence of error regarding the object to be grasped.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c25_18']	「於我等想即是非想」者，明於能取無有顛倒。	「於我等想即是非想」者，明於能取無有顛倒。	The notion of self is precisely non-notion clarifies the absence of error regarding the grasper.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c27_7']	此二如其次第，明我、法二無性智，佛於此義隨印妙生所說之事。	此二如其次第，明我、法二無性智，佛於此義隨印妙生所說之事。	These two, in their respective order, clarify the wisdom of the absence of self-nature in the two, self and dharmas. The Buddha approves Subhūti's statement regarding this meaning.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0878c29_4']	言「不驚、不怖、不畏」者，此三皆名為懼，即是驚懼、怖懼、畏懼，然隨事不同故有三別。	言「不驚、不怖、不畏」者，此三皆名為懼，即是驚懼、怖懼、畏懼，然隨事不同故有三別。	As for not startled, not frightened, not terrified, these three are all called fear, which is precisely startled fear, frightened fear, and terrified fear. However, because the specific situations are not the same, there are three distinctions.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a01_9']	言驚者謂，於非處生懼若正譯梵音應云越怖，今言驚等者，此為不能移舊；	言驚者謂，於非處生懼若正譯梵音應云越怖，今言驚等者，此為不能移舊；	As for startled, it means to give rise to fear in an inappropriate situation. If translated according to the Sanskrit, it should be called overcome fear. The present startled and so forth are because they cannot change the old.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a02_6']	若准論釋，驚義未甚相當，下二准此應可思之也，違越正理如越正道，可厭惡故。	若准論釋，驚義未甚相當，下二准此應可思之也，違越正理如越正道，可厭惡故。	If following the commentary's explanation, the meaning of startled is not very appropriate. The following two should be contemplated accordingly. Violating proper principles is like violating the proper path, because it can be detested.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a03_7']	言怖者應云續怖，相續生懼怖，既生已不能除斷故。	言怖者應云續怖，相續生懼怖，既生已不能除斷故。	The term fear should be said to be continuing fear, fear arising in continuity, and since it arises it cannot be eliminated.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a04_3']	言畏者應云定怖，生決定心一向畏懼。	言畏者應云定怖，生決定心一向畏懼。	The term dread should be said to be definite fear, giving rise to a definite mind of one-sided fear and dread.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a07_12']	此等若無，便成心離惶惑若不見本音本意，於文即未閑釋義，為此註出本音，斯乃可亡疑惑，餘家釋別，義非此論又此法門勝餘略詮故者，由經說此是最勝波羅蜜多如來所說經是略詮，又此法門族胄高勝故。	此等若無，便成心離惶惑若不見本音本意，於文即未閑釋義，為此註出本音，斯乃可亡疑惑，餘家釋別，義非此論又此法門勝餘略詮故者，由經說此是最勝波羅蜜多如來所說經是略詮，又此法門族胄高勝故。	If these do not exist, the mind becomes free from confusion. If one does not see the original sound and meaning, one is not yet familiar with the text and explaining the meaning. For this reason, the original sound is annotated, and then one can eliminate doubt. Other explanations are different, and the meaning is not that of this treatise. Moreover, this Dharma gate is superior to other brief explanations, because the sutra says that this is the most excellent perfection, and the Tathagata's sutra is a brief explanation. Moreover, this Dharma gate is of high lineage.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a08_5']	言勝族者，謂由諸佛所共說故。	言勝族者，謂由諸佛所共說故。	The term superior lineage means that it is spoken by all Buddhas.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a09_16']	然彼寶施無有如斯眾德圓備，即是成立此福望前福聚昇，況理別也。	然彼寶施無有如斯眾德圓備，即是成立此福望前福聚昇，況理別也。	However, the precious giving does not have such a complete collection of virtues, which is to establish this merit in comparison to the previous collection of merits, let alone the separate principle.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a12_10']	所云「於身是其苦性，彼施即是苦果性故，其福卑劣」者，然此法門若有持說，彼之大士行諸苦行，此亦豈非是招苦報？	所云「於身是其苦性，彼施即是苦果性故，其福卑劣」者，然此法門若有持說，彼之大士行諸苦行，此亦豈非是招苦報？	As for what is said, in the body it is the nature of suffering, because that giving is precisely the nature of the fruit of suffering, therefore the merit is inferior, then if this Dharma door is upheld and expounded, and that great being practices various austerities, is this also not the cause for the retribution of suffering?
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a12_19']	如何不是得苦果耶？	如何不是得苦果耶？	How is it not the fruit of suffering that is obtained?

['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a15_13']	彼德難量故，　　由斯名勝事。	彼德難量故，　　由斯名勝事。	Because the virtue is difficult to measure, it is called the superior matter.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a16_0']	由無恚怒情，　　不名為苦性，	由無恚怒情，　　不名為苦性，	Because there is no angry mind, it is not called the nature of suffering,

['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a18_6']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a19_15']	縱令彼人行苦行時有苦惱果，然於彼時由有堪忍性故，此名勝事。	縱令彼人行苦行時有苦惱果，然於彼時由有堪忍性故，此名勝事。	Even if that person has the fruit of suffering when practicing austerities, at that time because there is the nature of endurance, this is called the superior matter.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a20_1']	有其二因：	有其二因：	There are two causes:
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a21_2']	一是善性故，由諸波羅蜜多皆以善為體性故；	一是善性故，由諸波羅蜜多皆以善為體性故；	First, because it is of good nature, since all perfections are of good nature;
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a22_5']	二是彼德難量故，如經云「此即是其非波羅蜜多」。	二是彼德難量故，如經云「此即是其非波羅蜜多」。	Second, because their virtues are difficult to measure, as the sutra says this is not a perfection.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a23_3']	由彼德岸曾無知者，為此名為不知其岸。	由彼德岸曾無知者，為此名為不知其岸。	Because the other shore of those virtues has never been known, it is called not knowing its shore.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a25_4']	由與勝法相應故，即此難行之苦，望前苦惱自有殊別，何況我想瞋想悉皆無故必無其苦；	由與勝法相應故，即此難行之苦，望前苦惱自有殊別，何況我想瞋想悉皆無故必無其苦；	Because it is associated with superior dharmas, even this difficult practice and suffering have their own distinctions compared to previous sufferings, let alone the absence of the notion of self and the notion of anger, which definitely do not cause suffering;
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a26_7']	非但無苦更生悲樂，如經云「我無是想亦非無想」。	非但無苦更生悲樂，如經云「我無是想亦非無想」。	Not only is there no suffering, but compassion and joy are born, as the sutra says I have no such thoughts, nor am I without thoughts.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a27_3']	言非無想者，此顯有想與悲心相應。	言非無想者，此顯有想與悲心相應。	As for not being without thoughts, this shows that there are thoughts associated with the mind of compassion.
['ZH_T25_1513_002:0879a29_13']	准斯語理，若諸有情於我想等不除遣者，苦行之時見有苦惱，即便欲捨菩提之心，是故應離諸想，乃至廣說。	准斯語理，若諸有情於我想等不除遣者，苦行之時見有苦惱，即便欲捨菩提之心，是故應離諸想，乃至廣說。	According to this language and principle, if sentient beings do not eliminate the notion of self, etc., when they practice austerities, they will see suffering and immediately want to abandon the mind of enlightenment. Therefore, one should be free from all thoughts, and so on, as explained in detail.
