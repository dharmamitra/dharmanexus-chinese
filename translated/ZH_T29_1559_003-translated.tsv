['ZH_T29_1559_003:0184b05_3']	若人執滅心定無心，此人則有如此失，我今執滅心定有心。	若人執滅心定無心，此人則有如此失，我今執滅心定有心。	If one holds that the attainment of cessation is without mind, then one would have this fault. I now hold that the attainment of cessation has mind.

['ZH_T29_1559_003:0184b09_15']	若汝言佛世尊說緣受生愛，今有受於阿羅漢愛不生，如此於無心定雖復有觸，受想等不生。	若汝言佛世尊說緣受生愛，今有受於阿羅漢愛不生，如此於無心定雖復有觸，受想等不生。	If you say the World-Honored Buddha has said that craving arises based on feeling, and now there is feeling but craving does not arise for arhats, so it is the same in the attainment of non-perception, even though there is contact, feeling, perception, and so forth do not arise.

Therefore this explanation is not satisfactory.

Because of the arising of this mind, only the non-arising of other minds remains as its characteristic in the intervening period, so there is no separate entity.

When the practitioner emerges from samādhi, since it was previously non-existent and will later become non-existent, this samādhi is provisionally called conditioned.
