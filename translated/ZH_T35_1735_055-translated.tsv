Without the primary, there is no way to extend to the secondary; without the secondary, there is no way to manifest the primary. Without people, there is no way to realize the dharmas; without the dharmas, there is no way to perfect people.

['ZH_T35_1735_055:0917c24_7']	雖人有五十四，文殊一人四會說故，德生、有德同一問答，遍友無答不成會故。	雖人有五十四，文殊一人四會說故，德生、有德同一問答，遍友無答不成會故。	055	Although there are fifty-four people, because Mañjuśrī has four assemblies, and the virtues of Pūrṇa and the virtues of Sudhana are the same in terms of questions and answers, and because Manicintana has no answer and does not form an assembly.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0917c25_13']	若以遍友承前指後得名會者，善財則有五十四會。	若以遍友承前指後得名會者，善財則有五十四會。	055	If we take Manicintana's continuation of the previous and pointing to the later as forming an assembly, then Sudhana has fifty-four assemblies.

['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a01_16']	若以會顯人，則五十七，文殊分四故。	若以會顯人，則五十七，文殊分四故。	055	If we use the assemblies to reveal the people, there are fifty-seven, because Mañjuśrī is divided into four.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a02_11']	或剎塵數、或無盡無盡，思之。	或剎塵數、或無盡無盡，思之。	055	Or as numerous as dust motes in a buddha land, or endlessly endless. Think about it.

['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a06_8']	若爾，下文善財應收歸重閣，何乃見在菩提場耶？	若爾，下文善財應收歸重閣，何乃見在菩提場耶？	055	If that is so, then Sudhana should be subsumed and returned to the great pavilion. Why is he then seen to be in the site of enlightenment?
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a06_17']	以菩提為諸會本故。	以菩提為諸會本故。	055	Because enlightenment is the basis of all the assemblies.

['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a09_14']	一相對明表、二互融顯圓。	一相對明表、二互融顯圓。	055	First, using mutual contrast to clarify their representations; second, using mutual fusion to manifest their completeness.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a10_2']	今初，略明三對：	今初，略明三對：	055	First, roughly clarifying three pairs:
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a10_9']	一以能所相對。	一以能所相對。	055	First, using the host and guest to contrast each other.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a12_3']	普賢表所依法界，即在纏如來藏故，《理趣般若》云「一切眾生皆如來藏」。	普賢表所依法界，即在纏如來藏故，《理趣般若》云「一切眾生皆如來藏」。	055	Samantabhadra represents the Dharma realm that is relied upon, which is the tathāgatagarbha that is bound up with defilements. The Prajñāpāramitā of the Ultimate Meaning says: All sentient beings are tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a13_2']	普賢菩薩自體遍故，初會即入藏身三昧故。	普賢菩薩自體遍故，初會即入藏身三昧故。	055	Because the essence of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva is all-pervading, at the first assembly he immediately enters the samādhi of the womb of the Tathāgata's body.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a15_2']	文殊表能信之心，故《佛名經》說「一切諸佛皆因文殊而發心故」，善財始見發大心故。	文殊表能信之心，故《佛名經》說「一切諸佛皆因文殊而發心故」，善財始見發大心故。	055	Mañjuśrī represents the mind that is able to believe, therefore the Buddha-name Sūtra says: All buddhas are due to Mañjuśrī's arousing of the mind. Because Sudhana first saw him and aroused the great mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a15_9']	二以解行相對。	二以解行相對。	055	Second, in terms of understanding and practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a16_9']	普賢表所起萬行，上下諸經皆說普賢行故。	普賢表所起萬行，上下諸經皆說普賢行故。	055	Samantabhadra represents the myriad practices that are aroused, because the various sūtras above and below all speak of Samantabhadra's practices.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a17_5']	文殊表能起之解，通解理事故。	文殊表能起之解，通解理事故。	055	Mañjuśrī represents the understanding that is able to arouse them, because he comprehensively understands principles and events.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a17_9']	慈氏云：	慈氏云：	055	Maitreya says:
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a18_3']	「汝見善友，皆文殊力等」故。	「汝見善友，皆文殊力等」故。	055	You see good friends, all due to the power of Mañjuśrī.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a18_10']	三以理智相對。	三以理智相對。	055	Third, in terms of wisdom and principle.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a20_7']	普賢即所證法界，善財入身故，又云得究竟三世平等身故，普賢身相如虛空故。	普賢即所證法界，善財入身故，又云得究竟三世平等身故，普賢身相如虛空故。	055	Samantabhadra is the realized Dharma realm, because Sudhana entered his body, and also because it is said he attained the ultimate body equal in the three times, because Samantabhadra's body is like space.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a22_8']	文殊即能證大智，本所事佛名不動智故，見後文殊方見普賢故，又理開體用智分因果。	文殊即能證大智，本所事佛名不動智故，見後文殊方見普賢故，又理開體用智分因果。	055	Mañjuśrī is the realized great wisdom, because the Buddha he originally served was named Unmoving Wisdom, because after seeing Mañjuśrī one then sees Samantabhadra, and also because principle opens up essence and function, and wisdom divides cause and effect.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a22_18']	二互融顯圓者，亦二：	二互融顯圓者，亦二：	055	Second, revealing the perfect by the mutual inclusion of the two, also in two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a23_8']	先以二門各自圓融。	先以二門各自圓融。	055	First, using the two approaches to each have perfect interfusion.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a24_10']	謂解由前信方離邪見，信解真正成極智故。	謂解由前信方離邪見，信解真正成極智故。	055	This means that understanding is only possible after faith, because one then departs from wrong views, and with correct faith and understanding one achieves ultimate wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a26_2']	依體起行行必稱體，由行證理理行不殊，故隨一證即一切證。	依體起行行必稱體，由行證理理行不殊，故隨一證即一切證。	055	Based on essence to give rise to practice, practice must accord with essence, because through practice one realizes principle, and principle and practice are not different, so following any one realization is the realization of all.
['ZH_T35_1735_055:0918a27_2']	二以二聖法門互融，謂始信必信於理故。	二以二聖法門互融，謂始信必信於理故。	055	Second, using the two sages' Dharma approaches to mutually include, meaning that beginning with faith one must have faith in principle,
