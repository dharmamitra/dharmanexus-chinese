['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c04_9']	諸論中說貪瞋等隨次第起善不善者，謂愛非愛從此緣起，非不從緣，應知不正思惟分別能為起煩惱緣。	諸論中說貪瞋等隨次第起善不善者，謂愛非愛從此緣起，非不從緣，應知不正思惟分別能為起煩惱緣。	The treatises say that greed, hatred, etc. arise in sequence as good or bad, meaning that love and non-love arise from this condition, not without conditions. One should know that incorrect thought and discrimination can serve as the conditions for the arising of afflictions.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c06_6']	此中立驗，第一義中諸陰等有自體，是第一義中陰等從因緣起故，譬如貪等。	此中立驗，第一義中諸陰等有自體，是第一義中陰等從因緣起故，譬如貪等。	Here, a syllogism is established: In the ultimate truth, the aggregates, etc. have their own nature, because in the ultimate truth, the aggregates, etc. arise from causes and conditions, like greed, etc.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c07_1']	若無自體，不從緣起，譬如虛空華。	若無自體，不從緣起，譬如虛空華。	If they have no self-nature, they do not arise from conditions, like a sky flower.

['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c10_18']	非實者，謂貪等煩惱非第一義中起。	非實者，謂貪等煩惱非第一義中起。	Not real means that afflictions such as greed do not arise in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c11_12']	以是故汝闕譬喻，是立義有過。	以是故汝闕譬喻，是立義有過。	Therefore, your example is lacking, and there is an error in your thesis.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c12_15']	汝若言我以世諦為喻非第一義者，無有所成立法。	汝若言我以世諦為喻非第一義者，無有所成立法。	If you say that I use worldly truth as an analogy, not the ultimate truth, then there is no established dharma.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c13_11']	若於世諦中有成立者，反成我義。	若於世諦中有成立者，反成我義。	If there is establishment in worldly truth, it turns into establishing my meaning.

['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c17_15']	此謂我者非世諦得成，亦非第一義中得成，以是故若離於我則煩惱不有。	此謂我者非世諦得成，亦非第一義中得成，以是故若離於我則煩惱不有。	This means that the self is not established in worldly truth, nor is it established in the ultimate truth. Therefore, if apart from the self, then the afflictions do not exist.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c18_2']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c18_14']	能依無體故，所依亦無體。	能依無體故，所依亦無體。	Because the basis does not have a substance, the supported also lacks a substance.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c20_4']	為開此義，故如偈說，因我有煩惱者，煩惱是我法，亦是所受用故。	為開此義，故如偈說，因我有煩惱者，煩惱是我法，亦是所受用故。	In order to elucidate this meaning, the verse says, Because of my existence, there are afflictions. The afflictions are the dharmas of the self, and are also what is enjoyed and used.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c21_11']	然我自體不成，如〈觀我品〉中觀煩惱無能依處故，其驗如是。	然我自體不成，如〈觀我品〉中觀煩惱無能依處故，其驗如是。	However, the substance of the self is not established, as in the chapter on contemplating the self, because the afflictions are contemplated as having no basis to rely on. The evidence is like this.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c23_6']	第一義中貪等皆無，我依止無體故，譬如石女不生子，何得說言子色白黑耶？	第一義中貪等皆無，我依止無體故，譬如石女不生子，何得說言子色白黑耶？	In the ultimate truth, greed and so forth are all non-existent, because the self as a basis does not exist. It is like a barren woman not giving birth to a child. How can one say that the child's color is white or black?
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c23_11']	自部人言：	自部人言：	People of our own school say:
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c24_9']	雖無有我，但心與煩惱和合故有煩惱起。	雖無有我，但心與煩惱和合故有煩惱起。	Although there is no self, afflictions arise due to the combination of mind and afflictions.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c25_10']	而煩惱是心上法，汝立無我義者，其因不成。	而煩惱是心上法，汝立無我義者，其因不成。	And afflictions are dharmas that arise on the basis of mind. For you who establish the doctrine of no-self, your reason is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c25_14']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c25_19']	汝語非也。	汝語非也。	Your statement is not correct.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c26_5']	其過如論偈說：	其過如論偈說：	The error is as stated in the treatise's verses:
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c27_14']	「誰有彼煩惱，　　有義則不成；	「誰有彼煩惱，　　有義則不成；	Who has those afflictions? The meaning is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c28_13']	若離眾生者，　　煩惱則無屬。	若離眾生者，　　煩惱則無屬。	If apart from sentient beings, afflictions have no basis.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0121c29_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The commentary states:
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a01_4']	此謂煩惱是眾生者，於一切處推求眾生不可得。	此謂煩惱是眾生者，於一切處推求眾生不可得。	This means that if afflictions belong to sentient beings, sentient beings cannot be found anywhere upon thorough search.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a03_8']	若離眾生，煩惱無屬心起者，先已遮故，亦除識自體故，亦遮有實故，汝心義不成，非我因義不成。	若離眾生，煩惱無屬心起者，先已遮故，亦除識自體故，亦遮有實故，汝心義不成，非我因義不成。	If apart from sentient beings, afflictions have no connection to the arising of the mind, this has already been refuted. Also, because consciousness itself is excluded, and because real existence is refuted, your meaning of mind is not established, but my reason is not unestablished.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a03_13']	自部人言：	自部人言：	A person of our own school says:
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a05_2']	彼受無煩惱義者則以無為體，無體之體成故，諸體更互無體相。	彼受無煩惱義者則以無為體，無體之體成故，諸體更互無體相。	That which has the meaning of being without afflictions is then taken as having the nature of non-existence, because the nature of non-existence is established. Therefore, all natures mutually have the characteristic of non-existence.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a05_6']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a07_2', 'ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a08_17']	汝今欲得諸體若瓶若絹及餘物等有者，為是體、為是無體而言能起有覺因耶？🔽欲令瓶是無體者，則不應說此瓶與青黃黑色等和合，亦不應說青黃等色示人。	汝今欲得諸體若瓶若絹及餘物等有者，為是體、為是無體而言能起有覺因耶？ 欲令瓶是無體者，則不應說此瓶與青黃黑色等和合，亦不應說青黃等色示人。	If you now wish to obtain that all natures, whether a pot, cloth, or other objects, exist, is it by having a nature or by having no nature that you say can give rise to the cause of cognition?🔽If you wish to make the pot have no nature, then you should not say that this pot is a combination of blue, yellow, black, and other colors, and you should also not say that blue, yellow, and other colors can be pointed out to others.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a10_8']	若有無瓶絹處不可說，青黃等色亦不可指示於人，無依止處故。	若有無瓶絹處不可說，青黃等色亦不可指示於人，無依止處故。	If there is no pot or cloth, it cannot be said, and blue, yellow, and other colors also cannot be pointed out to others, because there is no basis.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a12_5']	是諸煩惱畢竟無主無體義者，如石女兒無青黃相可說故，是故以無為體義不成。	是諸煩惱畢竟無主無體義者，如石女兒無青黃相可說故，是故以無為體義不成。	The meaning of the ultimate non-existence of a master and substance of these afflictions is like the impossibility of speaking of the blue and yellow characteristics of a barren woman's child, therefore the meaning of having non-existence as substance is not established.

['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a14_13']	煩惱與染心，　　五求不可得。	煩惱與染心，　　五求不可得。	The afflictions and defiled mind are unobtainable in the five searches.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a15_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The explanation says:
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a16_6']	名色聚集因名為身，緣於自身起染污見，是名身見。	名色聚集因名為身，緣於自身起染污見，是名身見。	The accumulation of name and form is called the body. The defiled view that arises based on one's own body is called the view of the body.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a17_17']	貪等三種與此義同，如〈觀如來品〉中偈說「非陰不離陰，陰中無如來。	貪等三種與此義同，如〈觀如來品〉中偈說「非陰不離陰，陰中無如來。	The three kinds such as craving are the same in meaning as this. As a verse in the chapter on contemplating the Tathāgata says: Not the aggregates, not apart from the aggregates, the Tathāgata is not in the aggregates.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a18_8']	如來中無陰，非如來有陰。	如來中無陰，非如來有陰。	The Tathāgata is not in the aggregates, the Tathāgata does not possess the aggregates.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a19_17']	」諸煩惱亦如五種中無煩惱者，能起苦故名為煩惱，染者非煩惱。	」諸煩惱亦如五種中無煩惱者，能起苦故名為煩惱，染者非煩惱。	The afflictions are also like this. Among the five kinds, the afflictions do not exist. Because they can give rise to suffering, they are called afflictions. The defiled one is not an affliction.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a21_2']	今為遮不異義故，若染者即煩惱，能燒所燒同得一過。	今為遮不異義故，若染者即煩惱，能燒所燒同得一過。	Now, in order to refute the meaning of non-difference, if the defiled one is the same as the defilements, the burner and the burned would both incur the same fault.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a21_18']	亦不異煩惱有染者，此義已如先遮。	亦不異煩惱有染者，此義已如先遮。	Also, it is not the case that the defiled one exists differently from the defilements. This meaning has already been refuted above.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a23_8']	復次若異煩惱得有染者，則離煩惱獨有染者過，是故異體不成。	復次若異煩惱得有染者，則離煩惱獨有染者過，是故異體不成。	Moreover, if the defiled one exists differently from the defilements, then there would be the fault of the defiled one existing alone, apart from the defilements. Therefore, a different substance is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a25_3']	染者中亦無煩惱，煩惱中亦無染者，亦非染者有煩惱，如是五種求煩惱無體。	染者中亦無煩惱，煩惱中亦無染者，亦非染者有煩惱，如是五種求煩惱無體。	Within the defiled one, there are also no defilements. Within the defilements, there is also no defiled one. The defiled one does not possess defilements. In this way, the five kinds of seeking for the defilements have no substance.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122a26_4']	以煩惱無體故，則無能成立法，是汝譬喻有過。	以煩惱無體故，則無能成立法，是汝譬喻有過。	Because the defilements have no substance, then there is no dharma that can be established. This is the fault in your analogy.

For this reason, in the ultimate truth, afflictions are not dharmas that arise from conditions, because there is no dharma that can establish this as your thesis.

['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122b09_10']	此中說驗，第一義中有愛非愛顛倒為緣，能起貪瞋癡等，第一義中物有體故。	此中說驗，第一義中有愛非愛顛倒為緣，能起貪瞋癡等，第一義中物有體故。	Here, a logical argument is presented: In the ultimate truth, attachment and non-attachment as conditions can give rise to greed, anger, delusion, etc., because substances have substance in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122b10_18']	若言無者，非六物體，譬如生盲者眼識，又貪瞋等能起顛倒分別。	若言無者，非六物體，譬如生盲者眼識，又貪瞋等能起顛倒分別。	If it is said that they do not exist, they are not the substance of the six substances, like the eye consciousness of one born blind. Moreover, greed, anger, etc. can give rise to inverted discrimination.
['ZH_T30_1566_014:0122b12_3']	如我所說，因有力故有諸顛倒，以是因緣譬喻無過。	如我所說，因有力故有諸顛倒，以是因緣譬喻無過。	As I have said, because the cause has power, there are various inversions. For this reason, the analogy is faultless.
