['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c18_12']	明於見後方起修故。	明於見後方起修故。	This clarifies that only after seeing does one give rise to cultivation.

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c20_11']	略解釋者。	略解釋者。	The brief explanation is as follows.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c21_1']	此中初以九地漸斷。	此中初以九地漸斷。	Here, the first is the gradual elimination of the nine grounds.

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c21_17']	得一來果必依未至。	得一來果必依未至。	Attaining the fruit of once-returning must rely on the stage of not yet attained.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c22_5']	其不還亦爾。	其不還亦爾。	The non-returner is also like this.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c24_2']	然必起無漏道方始得果　有入靜慮．無色起對治道亦有何失　此亦不然。	然必起無漏道方始得果　有入靜慮．無色起對治道亦有何失　此亦不然。	However, one must generate the uncontaminated path in order to begin to attain the fruits. What is wrong with entering the meditative absorptions and formless attainments and generating the counteractive path? This is also not so.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c25_3']	五十三說不還者唯五地於欲界有斷對治。	五十三說不還者唯五地於欲界有斷對治。	The Abhidharma-saṃuccaya says that non-returners only have five grounds for eliminating the counteractive path in the desire realm.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c25_9']	不說無色有。	不說無色有。	It does not say that the formless realm has it.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c25_15']	又此唯超越。	又此唯超越。	Moreover, this is only for those who skip stages.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c26_14']	非次第者　第二三界九地合為九品斷者。	非次第者　第二三界九地合為九品斷者。	It is not for those who progress in sequence. The second, those who eliminate the three realms and nine grounds as nine grades,

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c27_16']	餘果不能起勝作業。	餘果不能起勝作業。	The other fruits cannot generate superior karmic activity.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c28_3']	缺煩惱故。	缺煩惱故。	Because they lack afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0590c28_14']	指端經．及分別經中說。	指端經．及分別經中說。	The Sutra on the Finger Garland and the Sutra on Distinctions say:

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a02_1']	此亦依三無色。	此亦依三無色。	This also relies on the three formless realms.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a02_14']	斯有何過　然加行心是色界。	斯有何過　然加行心是色界。	What is wrong with this? However, the mind of applied practice is of the form realm,
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a03_11']	總緣三界故無間道可起無色上地。	總緣三界故無間道可起無色上地。	because it generally takes the three realms as its object. The uninterrupted path can generate the upper grounds of the formless realm.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a04_8']	如不還於五地有欲界斷對治故。	如不還於五地有欲界斷對治故。	For example, nonreturners have the antidote for the elimination of the realm of desire in the five stages.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a04_13']	此亦應爾。	此亦應爾。	This should be the same.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a05_4']	應說此義理不違也。	應說此義理不違也。	You should explain this so that it does not contradict reason.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a05_14']	但非以下道能斷上惑。	但非以下道能斷上惑。	However, it is not the case that a lower path can eliminate the passions of a higher stage.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a06_7']	由意樂力別故應作四句。	由意樂力別故應作四句。	You should make a fourfold distinction on the basis of the power of aspiration.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a07_1']	不爾但以五地得第三果。	不爾但以五地得第三果。	Otherwise, one would only attain the third fruit in the five stages.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a07_11']	無色於下無斷對治故。	無色於下無斷對治故。	Because the formless realm has no antidote for the elimination of lower stages.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a08_11']	尚不許九無間道入根本定得次第第三果。	尚不許九無間道入根本定得次第第三果。	One is not even allowed to enter the fundamental samādhi of the nine uninterrupted paths and attain the third fruit in sequence.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a09_12', 'ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a10_5']	況預流者得四靜慮．及三無色證超果也。🔽於修道中未得下斷惑道。	況預流者得四靜慮．及三無色證超果也。 於修道中未得下斷惑道。	How much less could one who has attained the stream enter the four meditations and three formless states and realize the fruit of nonreturner?🔽In the path of cultivation, one who has not yet attained the path of elimination of the passions of a lower stage
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a10_14']	不能起上斷惑道故。	不能起上斷惑道故。	cannot generate the path of elimination of the passions of a higher stage.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0591a11_1']	遊觀可爾。	遊觀可爾。	This is possible for the contemplation of the four truths.

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b18_11']	此中初說唯無分別智能斷二障隨眠。	此中初說唯無分別智能斷二障隨眠。	There is an interpretation that the fundamental [wisdom] is able to eliminate the two obstacles' latent tendencies, because it is the antidote that is able to eliminate.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b18_16']	後得不然。	後得不然。	The subsequently attained [wisdom] is not like this,

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b19_15']	相分境相仍有故不能斷。	相分境相仍有故不能斷。	Because the aspect of the objective realm still exists, it is unable to eliminate [latent tendencies].
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b20_7']	唯無分別智有此斷能。	唯無分別智有此斷能。	Only the wisdom that is without discrimination has this ability to eliminate.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b21_3']	諸經論中無說後得能斷隨眠。	諸經論中無說後得能斷隨眠。	Among the various sūtras and treatises, there is no statement that the subsequently attained [wisdom] is able to eliminate latent tendencies.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b22_3']	非諸菩薩見．修二道前斷所知用無分別。	非諸菩薩見．修二道前斷所知用無分別。	It is not the case that the bodhisattvas' two paths of insight and cultivation do not use non-discrimination to eliminate the knowable before [eliminating the afflictive hindrances].

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b24_10']	後得無力能斷迷理見．疑等隨眠。	後得無力能斷迷理見．疑等隨眠。	The subsequently-attained [cognition] is powerless to eliminate the latent afflictions of views and doubts that are deluded about principles.

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b26_8']	迷理隨眠行相深遠。	迷理隨眠行相深遠。	The latent afflictions of being deluded about principles have a profound mode of activity.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b26_17']	要證彼理方能斷之。	要證彼理方能斷之。	One must realize that principle in order to eliminate them.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b27_7']	迷事隨眠行相淺近。	迷事隨眠行相淺近。	The latent afflictions of being deluded about objects have a shallow mode of activity.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b27_17']	雖實有相觀亦能斷之。	雖實有相觀亦能斷之。	Even though they have real characteristics, contemplation can still eliminate them.

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b28_11']	故瑜伽說至相執引故。	故瑜伽說至相執引故。	Therefore the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that the subsequently-attained [cognition] is able to eliminate the latent afflictions of the realm of objects because it is attracted by the grasping of characteristics.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b28_14']	述曰。	述曰。	The commentary says:
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594b29_1']	第五十五說。	第五十五說。	The fifty-fifth [chapter] says:

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594c03_8']	以有二因。	以有二因。	Because there are two causes.
['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594c03_13']	如文可解。	如文可解。	As the text can be understood.

['ZH_T43_1830_10b:0594c10_12']	亦是後得斷　不違理故。	亦是後得斷　不違理故。	It is also the elimination by subsequently attained [cognition], because it does not contradict principle.
