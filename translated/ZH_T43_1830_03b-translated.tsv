['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b16_6']	初廣前。	初廣前。	03b	The first is the extensive explanation of the previous,
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b17_1']	故破他　正三和體謂根．境．識。	故破他　正三和體謂根．境．識。	03b	therefore refuting others. The correct essence of the three being in harmony refers to the faculty, object, and consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b17_6']	體異名三。	體異名三。	03b	The different essences are called the three.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b18_1']	不相乖返更相交涉名為隨順。	不相乖返更相交涉名為隨順。	03b	Not contradicting each other and mutually corresponding is called following.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b18_15']	如識不生根．境或起名為乖返。	如識不生根．境或起名為乖返。	03b	For example, if consciousness does not arise, the faculties and objects may arise, which is called contradicting.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b19_15']	又如耳根．眼識．香境三法乖返不名三和。	又如耳根．眼識．香境三法乖返不名三和。	03b	Moreover, the three dharmas of the ear faculty, eye consciousness, and fragrance object contradict each other and are not called the three combined.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b20_1']	若相順者。	若相順者。	03b	If they correspond with each other,
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b20_6']	三必俱生。	三必俱生。	03b	the three must arise together.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b20_15']	既不相違故名隨順。	既不相違故名隨順。	03b	Since they do not contradict each other, they are called following.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b21_1']	根可為依。	根可為依。	03b	The faculty can serve as the basis.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b21_6']	境可為取。	境可為取。	03b	The object can be grasped.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b21_11']	識二所生。	識二所生。	03b	Consciousness is produced by the two.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b22_2']	可依於根而取於境。	可依於根而取於境。	03b	It can rely on the faculty to grasp the object.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b22_11']	如此交涉名三和體。	如此交涉名三和體。	03b	Such mutual correspondence is called the essence of the three combined.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b23_12']	下解於觸由二義故亦名三和。	下解於觸由二義故亦名三和。	03b	Below, it explains that because of two meanings, contact is also called the three combined.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b24_1']	論。	論。	03b	The treatise states:
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b24_11']	觸依彼生至故說為彼。	觸依彼生至故說為彼。	03b	Contact arises in dependence on them, therefore it is said to be of them.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b24_14']	述曰。	述曰。	03b	The commentary states:
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b25_14']	即由二義觸名三和　一依彼生　彼即根等。	即由二義觸名三和　一依彼生　彼即根等。	03b	Contact is called the three combined because of two meanings: first, it arises in dependence on them, where them refers to the faculties and so forth.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b26_1']	是觸之因。	是觸之因。	03b	This is the cause of contact.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b26_10']	依三和故亦名三和。	依三和故亦名三和。	03b	Because it depends on the three combined, it is also called the three combined.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b27_1']	故聖教言三和生觸。	故聖教言三和生觸。	03b	Therefore the holy teachings say that the three combined give rise to contact.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b28_3']	對法亦云依三和合　二令彼合　彼亦根等。	對法亦云依三和合　二令彼合　彼亦根等。	03b	The Abhidharma also says that it is based on the combination of the three. The two make them combine. Those also are the faculties, etc.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b28_8']	即觸之果。	即觸之果。	03b	It is the effect of contact.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b29_9']	謂觸能令根等三法合為依．取．所生了別。	謂觸能令根等三法合為依．取．所生了別。	03b	That is to say, contact can make the three dharmas of the faculties, etc., combine to be the basis, the grasping, and the discrimination that is produced by the two.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328b29_18']	此三和合由觸故然。	此三和合由觸故然。	03b	This combination of the three is made possible by contact.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c01_7']	故說觸能和合三法。	故說觸能和合三法。	03b	Therefore it is said that contact can combine the three dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c01_16']	由此二義觸名三和。	由此二義觸名三和。	03b	For these two reasons, contact is called the combination of the three.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c02_8']	非一觸體可名三故。	非一觸體可名三故。	03b	Because a single contact cannot be called the three.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c02_18']	從觸之因．及所和果。	從觸之因．及所和果。	03b	From the cause of contact and the effect that is combined,🔽Contact is said to be the combination of the three.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c04_2']	說觸為彼三和合也　問境在未來根住過去。	說觸為彼三和合也　問境在未來根住過去。	03b	Question: The object is in the future, the faculty abides in the past,
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c04_7']	識居現在。	識居現在。	03b	And consciousness is in the present.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c05_10']	觸如何和　答令相隨順為依．為取．為二所生。	觸如何和　答令相隨順為依．為取．為二所生。	03b	How does contact combine them? Answer: It makes them conform to each other, to be the basis, to be the grasping, and to be produced by the two.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c07_2']	即名三和　豈是合三令住一處方名三和　或依增上根說三和。	即名三和　豈是合三令住一處方名三和　或依增上根說三和。	03b	This is called the combination of the three. How can it be that combining the three and making them abide in one place is called the combination of the three? Or, based on the superior faculty, the combination of the three is spoken of.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c07_11']	非等無間觸名三和。	非等無間觸名三和。	03b	The contact that is not immediately antecedent is called the combination of the three.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c07_16']	於理無失。	於理無失。	03b	There is no error in principle.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c08_8']	根．境．識三常現在世。	根．境．識三常現在世。	03b	The three faculties, objects, and consciousnesses are always present in the present world.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c08_17']	無一根境住於他世。	無一根境住於他世。	03b	There is no faculty or object that abides in the past or future worlds.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c09_13']	去．來二世非實有故　問境在未來。	去．來二世非實有故　問境在未來。	03b	Because the two worlds of past and future do not really exist. Question: If the object is in the future,
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c10_1']	觸在現在。	觸在現在。	03b	and contact is in the present,🔽how can contact be said to be the effect of that?
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c11_2']	如何說觸是彼果耶　答誰言所生即是彼果。	如何說觸是彼果耶　答誰言所生即是彼果。	03b	Answer: Who says what is produced is the effect of that?
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c11_11']	未來諸法為現取時。	未來諸法為現取時。	03b	When future dharmas are grasped by the present,
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c12_2']	但能為境順生心等。	但能為境順生心等。	03b	they can only serve as objects and give rise to mind and so forth in accordance with them.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c12_12']	故現識．觸名境所生。	故現識．觸名境所生。	03b	Therefore, the present consciousness and contact are called what is produced by the object.🔽It is not necessary that what is produced is the effect of that.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c13_11']	非要所生即是彼果　又彼境界體唯現在。	非要所生即是彼果　又彼境界體唯現在。	03b	Moreover, the substance of that object is only in the present.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c14_3']	似於去．來觸雖所生。	似於去．來觸雖所生。	03b	Although contact, which resembles the past and future, is what is produced,
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c14_8']	亦名為果。	亦名為果。	03b	it is also called the effect.
['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c15_17']	上來解總觸謂三和　自下釋前分別變異。	上來解總觸謂三和　自下釋前分別變異。	03b	The above explains the general contact, which is the three unities. From here below, it explains the discrimination and transformation mentioned previously.

['ZH_T43_1830_03b:0328c20_1']	謂此三法居種子時。	謂此三法居種子時。	03b	This means that when these three dharmas are in the state of seeds,
