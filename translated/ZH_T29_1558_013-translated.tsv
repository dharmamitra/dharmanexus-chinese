['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b12_2']	非由一主先覺而生，但由有情業差別起。	非由一主先覺而生，但由有情業差別起。	It is not produced by a single ruler who awakens first, but arises from the differences in the karma of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b12_12']	若爾，何故俱從業生？	若爾，何故俱從業生？	If so, why do they all arise from karma?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b13_13']	欝金栴檀等甚可愛樂，而內身形等與彼相違。	欝金栴檀等甚可愛樂，而內身形等與彼相違。	Saffron, sandalwood, etc. are very delightful, but the inner physical form, etc. are contrary to them.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b15_4']	以諸有情業類如是，若造雜業感內身形，於九瘡門常流不淨。	以諸有情業類如是，若造雜業感內身形，於九瘡門常流不淨。	It is because the types of karma of sentient beings are like this. If one creates mixed karma, one will experience an inner physical form, with the nine orifices constantly flowing with impurities.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b16_4']	為對治彼，感外具生色香味觸甚可愛樂。	為對治彼，感外具生色香味觸甚可愛樂。	In order to counteract that, one experiences the arising of external objects with very delightful color, smell, taste, and touch.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b17_4']	諸天眾等造純淨業，故彼所招二事俱妙。	諸天眾等造純淨業，故彼所招二事俱妙。	The heavenly beings, etc. create pure karma, therefore the two things they attract are both wonderful.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b17_13']	此所由業其體是何？	此所由業其體是何？	What is the nature of the action that causes this?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b18_3']	謂心所思及思所作。	謂心所思及思所作。	It is volition and what is done by volition.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b18_8']	故契經說：	故契經說：	Therefore a scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b19_12']	有二種業，一者思業、二思已業，思已業者謂思所作。	有二種業，一者思業、二思已業，思已業者謂思所作。	There are two kinds of action: first, the action of volition; second, the action that is done by volition. Action that is done by volition refers to what is done by volition.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b20_13']	如是二業分別為三，謂即有情身、語、意業。	如是二業分別為三，謂即有情身、語、意業。	These two actions are distinguished as three: that is, the actions of body, speech, and mind of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b21_2']	如何建立此三業耶？	如何建立此三業耶？	How are these three actions established?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b21_17']	為約所依、為據自性、為就等起？	為約所依、為據自性、為就等起？	Are they established on the basis of support, or on the basis of nature, or on the basis of origination?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b22_3']	縱爾何違？	縱爾何違？	What is wrong with these interpretations?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b23_3']	若約所依應唯一業，以一切業並依身故。	若約所依應唯一業，以一切業並依身故。	If they are established on the basis of support, there should be only one action, because all actions are supported on the body.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b24_5']	若據自性應唯語是業，以三種中唯語即業故。	若據自性應唯語是業，以三種中唯語即業故。	If they are established on the basis of nature, there should be only speech as action, because of the three, only speech is action.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b25_7']	若就等起亦應唯一業，以一切業皆意等起故。	若就等起亦應唯一業，以一切業皆意等起故。	If they are established on the basis of origination, there should be only one action, because all actions originate in the mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b26_7']	毘婆沙師說立三業，如其次第由上三因。	毘婆沙師說立三業，如其次第由上三因。	The Vaibhāṣikas say that the establishment of the three actions is due to the above three reasons in the order in which they are presented.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b27_16']	然心所思即是意業，思所作業分為身、語二業，是思所等起故。	然心所思即是意業，思所作業分為身、語二業，是思所等起故。	However, the mental activity that is thought is itself mental action. The activity that is generated by thought is divided into the two actions of body and speech because they are the equal and immediate condition for the generation of thought.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b28_5']	身語二業自性云何？	身語二業自性云何？	What is the essential nature of the two actions of body and speech?

['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067b29_13']	此身語二業，　　俱表無表性。	此身語二業，　　俱表無表性。	These two actions of body and speech are by nature both revealing and nonrevealing.

['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c02_3']	應知如是所說諸業中，身語二業俱表無表性。	應知如是所說諸業中，身語二業俱表無表性。	It should be understood that among the actions discussed above, the two actions of body and speech are by nature both revealing and nonrevealing.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c02_12']	且身語表其相云何？	且身語表其相云何？	What are the characteristics of revealing and nonrevealing forms of the two actions of body and speech?

['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c03_0']	身表許別形，　　非行動為體，	身表許別形，　　非行動為體，	It is admitted that bodily revealing form is a particular shape, not movement by nature,
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c04_13']	以諸有為法，　　有剎那盡故。	以諸有為法，　　有剎那盡故。	Because all conditioned dharmas perish moment by moment.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c05_0']	應無無因故，　　生因應能滅，	應無無因故，　　生因應能滅，	If it were movement, there would be no cause for it, and therefore the cause of arising would be the cause of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c06_0']	形亦非實有，　　應二根取故，	形亦非實有，　　應二根取故，	Shape also does not really exist, because it should be perceived by two sense organs.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c07_13']	無別極微故，　　語表許言聲。	無別極微故，　　語表許言聲。	There is no separate atom of shape, and therefore vocal revealing form is admitted to be the sound of speech.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c08_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c09_3']	由思力故，別起如是如是身形，名身表業。	由思力故，別起如是如是身形，名身表業。	By the power of thought, a particular shape of the body is produced, and this is called bodily revealing form.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c09_8']	有餘部說：	有餘部說：	Other schools say:
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c10_3']	動名身表，以身動時由業動故。	動名身表，以身動時由業動故。	Motion is called bodily manifest action, because when the body moves, it is moved by action.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c11_6']	為破此故，說非行動，以一切有為皆有剎那故。	為破此故，說非行動，以一切有為皆有剎那故。	In order to refute this, it is said that it is not motion, because all conditioned dharmas have moments.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c11_11']	剎那何謂？	剎那何謂？	What is a moment?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c12_18']	得體無間滅，有此剎那法，名有剎那，如有杖人名為有杖。	得體無間滅，有此剎那法，名有剎那，如有杖人名為有杖。	The dharma that has a moment is called having a moment, just as a person with a staff is called having a staff.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c13_17']	諸有為法纔得自體，從此無間必滅歸無。	諸有為法纔得自體，從此無間必滅歸無。	All conditioned dharmas, as soon as they obtain their own nature, necessarily perish in the next moment and return to nonexistence.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c15_8']	若此處生即此處滅，無容從此轉至餘方，故不可言動名身表。	若此處生即此處滅，無容從此轉至餘方，故不可言動名身表。	If they are born in this place, they perish in this place. It is not possible for them to move and reach another place. Therefore it cannot be said that motion is called bodily manifest action.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c16_8']	若有為法皆有剎那，不至餘方義可成立。	若有為法皆有剎那，不至餘方義可成立。	If all conditioned dharmas have moments, the meaning of not reaching another place can be established.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c17_17']	諸有為法皆有剎那，其理極成後必盡故，謂有為法滅不待因。	諸有為法皆有剎那，其理極成後必盡故，謂有為法滅不待因。	All conditioned dharmas have moments. This principle is completely established because they must perish later. This means that the cessation of conditioned dharmas does not depend on a cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c18_4']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c18_19']	待因謂果，滅無非果，故不待因。	待因謂果，滅無非果，故不待因。	That which depends on a cause is a result. Cessation is not a result, and therefore it does not depend on a cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c19_11']	滅既不待因，纔生已即滅。	滅既不待因，纔生已即滅。	Since cessation does not depend on a cause, as soon as it is born it immediately ceases.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c20_11']	若初不滅，後亦應然，以後與初有性等故。	若初不滅，後亦應然，以後與初有性等故。	If it did not cease at the beginning, it should not cease later either, because later it is the same as at the beginning.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c21_2']	既後有盡，知前有滅。	既後有盡，知前有滅。	Since later it is exhausted, we know that at the beginning it ceased.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c22_2']	若後有異方可滅者，不應即此而名有異。	若後有異方可滅者，不應即此而名有異。	If later it is different and then ceases, it should not be called different from what it was.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c22_12']	即此相異，理必不然。	即此相異，理必不然。	It is definitely not reasonable for it to be different from itself.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c23_11']	豈不世間現見薪等，由與火合故致滅無？	豈不世間現見薪等，由與火合故致滅無？	Isn't it seen in the world that firewood, etc. are destroyed by contact with fire?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c24_11']	定無餘量過現量者，故非法滅皆不待因。	定無餘量過現量者，故非法滅皆不待因。	There is definitely no other valid cognition that surpasses direct perception, so the destruction of dharmas is not all independent of causes.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c25_4']	如何知薪等，由火合故滅？	如何知薪等，由火合故滅？	How do you know that firewood, etc. are destroyed by contact with fire?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c25_16']	以薪等火合，後便不見故。	以薪等火合，後便不見故。	Because after firewood, etc. come into contact with fire, they are no longer seen.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c26_16']	應共審思，如是薪等，為由火合滅故不見？	應共審思，如是薪等，為由火合滅故不見？	We should carefully consider whether firewood, etc. are not seen because they are destroyed by contact with fire,
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c28_7']	為前薪等生已自滅，後不更生無故不見，如風手合燈焰鈴聲？	為前薪等生已自滅，後不更生無故不見，如風手合燈焰鈴聲？	or whether the firewood, etc. that have already been born cease by themselves, and because they are not born again later, they are not seen, like the flame of a lamp or the sound of a bell when they come into contact with wind or a hand?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c28_16']	故此義成應由比量。	故此義成應由比量。	Therefore, this meaning should be established by inference.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c29_3']	何謂比量？	何謂比量？	What is inference?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0067c29_17']	謂如前說，滅無非果故不待因。	謂如前說，滅無非果故不待因。	It is as explained above. Cessation is not a result and therefore does not depend on a cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a02_8']	又若待因薪等方滅，應一切滅無不待因，如生待因，無無因者。	又若待因薪等方滅，應一切滅無不待因，如生待因，無無因者。	Moreover, if fuel, etc., depend on a cause in order to cease, then all cessation would not depend on a cause, just as arising depends on a cause and there is nothing without a cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a03_16']	然世現見覺焰音聲，不待餘因剎那自滅，故薪等滅亦不待因。	然世現見覺焰音聲，不待餘因剎那自滅，故薪等滅亦不待因。	But the world clearly sees that the flame of a lamp and a sound, without depending on another cause, cease by themselves in a moment. Therefore the cessation of fuel, etc., also does not depend on a cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a04_7']	有執覺聲前因後滅。	有執覺聲前因後滅。	There is an opinion that the flame of a lamp and a sound cease after the cause that produces them.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a04_17']	彼亦非理，二不俱故。	彼亦非理，二不俱故。	This also is unreasonable, because the two do not occur together.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a05_16']	疑智苦樂及貪瞋等，自相相違理無俱義。	疑智苦樂及貪瞋等，自相相違理無俱義。	Doubt, knowledge, suffering, pleasure, craving, hatred, etc., are mutually contradictory in their essential natures and there is no meaning in their occurring together.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a07_13']	若復有位明了覺聲無間便生不明了者，如何同類不明了法能滅明了同類法耶？	若復有位明了覺聲無間便生不明了者，如何同類不明了法能滅明了同類法耶？	Moreover, if in a certain state a clear and distinct flame of a lamp or a sound is immediately followed by an unclear and indistinct one, how can a similar indistinct state extinguish a similar clear and distinct state?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a08_4']	最後覺聲復由誰滅？	最後覺聲復由誰滅？	By what is the final flame of a lamp or the final sound extinguished?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a08_16']	有執燈焰滅，以住無為因。	有執燈焰滅，以住無為因。	There is an opinion that the extinction of the flame of a lamp is caused by the state of abiding.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a09_9']	有執焰滅時，由法非法力。	有執焰滅時，由法非法力。	There is an opinion that when the flame of a lamp is extinguished, it is due to the power of dharmas and non-dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a09_19']	彼俱非理，無非因故。	彼俱非理，無非因故。	Both of these are unreasonable, because there is no non-cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a11_2']	非法非法為生滅因，以剎那剎那順違相反故。	非法非法為生滅因，以剎那剎那順違相反故。	Non-dharmas and non-dharmas are the causes of birth and cessation, because moment after moment they are in opposition to each other.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a12_2']	或於一切有為法中，皆可計度有此因義。	或於一切有為法中，皆可計度有此因義。	Or, in all conditioned dharmas, one can calculate that there is this meaning of cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a13_5']	既爾，本諍便應止息，許不待餘因皆有剎那故。	既爾，本諍便應止息，許不待餘因皆有剎那故。	If this is so, then the original dispute should come to an end, because it is admitted that all dharmas have moments without waiting for other causes.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a14_16']	又若薪等滅，火合為因，於熟變生中有下中上，應生因體即成滅因。	又若薪等滅，火合為因，於熟變生中有下中上，應生因體即成滅因。	Moreover, if the cessation of firewood, etc., is caused by the combination of fire, and there is inferior, middling, and superior in the production of cooked transformation, then the essence of the cause of production becomes the cause of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a15_3']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a16_8']	謂由火合能令薪等有熟變生，中上熟生、下中熟滅。	謂由火合能令薪等有熟變生，中上熟生、下中熟滅。	This is because the combination of fire can cause firewood, etc., to have the production of cooked transformation. Superior cooked transformation is produced, and inferior and middling cooked transformation ceases.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a17_15']	或即或似生上中因，即能為因滅下中熟，則生因體應即滅因。	或即或似生上中因，即能為因滅下中熟，則生因體應即滅因。	Either the cause of the production of superior and middling is the same as or similar to the cause of the cessation of inferior and middling cooked transformation, then the essence of the cause of production should be the same as the cause of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a19_13']	或滅生因應相無別，不應由即此，或似此彼有，彼復由即此，或似此非有。	或滅生因應相無別，不應由即此，或似此彼有，彼復由即此，或似此非有。	Or the cause of cessation and the cause of production should be without any difference in characteristics. It should not be that by means of this or what is similar to this, that exists, and that again by means of this or what is similar to this, it does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a20_12']	設於火焰差別生中，容計能生能滅因異；	設於火焰差別生中，容計能生能滅因異；	Even if you allow that in the case of the difference in the arising of flames, you can imagine that the causes of arising and cessation are different,
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a22_3']	於灰雪酢日水地合能令薪等熟變生中，如何計度生滅因異？	於灰雪酢日水地合能令薪等熟變生中，如何計度生滅因異？	in the case of the combination of ashes, snow, vinegar, sun, water, and earth that causes the maturation and transformation of firewood, etc., how can you imagine that the causes of arising and cessation are different?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a23_4']	若爾，現見煎水減盡，火合於中為何所作？	若爾，現見煎水減盡，火合於中為何所作？	If this is so, then you now see that boiling water diminishes and is exhausted. What function does the combination with fire have in this case?
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a25_13']	由事火合火界力增，由火界增能令水聚於後後位生漸漸微，乃至最微後便不續，是名火合於中所作。	由事火合火界力增，由火界增能令水聚於後後位生漸漸微，乃至最微後便不續，是名火合於中所作。	Due to the combination with fire, the power of the fire element increases. Due to the increase in the fire element, it can cause the aggregate of water to gradually diminish in each subsequent state, until it is the most subtle and then does not continue. This is called the function of the combination with fire in this case.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a26_14']	故無有因令諸法滅，法自然滅，是壞性故。	故無有因令諸法滅，法自然滅，是壞性故。	Therefore there is no cause that causes dharmas to cease. Dharmas naturally cease, because this is their nature of destruction.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a27_3']	自然滅故，纔生即滅。	自然滅故，纔生即滅。	Because they naturally cease, they cease as soon as they arise.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a27_15']	由纔生即滅，剎那滅義成。	由纔生即滅，剎那滅義成。	Because they cease as soon as they arise, the meaning of cessation in a moment is established.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068a29_8']	有剎那故定無行動，然於無間異方生中，如燒草焰行，起行增上慢。	有剎那故定無行動，然於無間異方生中，如燒草焰行，起行增上慢。	Because there is a moment, there is definitely no movement. However, in the arising in a different place without interruption, like the movement of a burning grass flame, the supernormal knowledge of movement arises.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068b01_7']	既由斯理行動定無，身表是形理得成立。	既由斯理行動定無，身表是形理得成立。	Therefore, movement definitely does not exist, and bodily expression is established as shape.
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068b01_12']	然經部說：	然經部說：	However, the Sautrāntikas say:
['ZH_T29_1558_013:0068b05_16']	形非實有，謂顯色聚一面多生即於其中假立長色，待此長色於餘色聚一面少中假立短色，於四方面並多生中假立方色，於一切處遍滿生中假立圓色，所餘形色隨應當知。	形非實有，謂顯色聚一面多生即於其中假立長色，待此長色於餘色聚一面少中假立短色，於四方面並多生中假立方色，於一切處遍滿生中假立圓色，所餘形色隨應當知。	Shape does not really exist. They say that when a mass of visible form is born in abundance on one side, it is provisionally established as the color long. In dependence on this color long, when there is a paucity of color on another side, it is provisionally established as the color short.

That is to say, one first establishes a vow to not do evil, and later frequently recollects and brings forth a sense of shame and remorse, able to restrain oneself and not violate the precepts.
