['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c09_15']	初一恒生不生破。	初一恒生不生破。	The first is a refutation of eternal production and non-production.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c09_19']	於中四。	於中四。	In this, there are four.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c10_2']	初出過。	初出過。	First, pointing out the error.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c10_7']	二牒計破。	二牒計破。	Second, refuting the theory by citing it.

['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c10_17']	四結成破。	四結成破。	Fourth, concluding the refutation.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c11_1']	前二縱破。	前二縱破。	The first two are refutations by concession.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c11_9']	謂將已生同未生。	謂將已生同未生。	That is to say, if what has already arisen is the same as what has not yet arisen,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c11_14']	則應恒生。	則應恒生。	then it should always arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c11_19']	後二奪破。	後二奪破。	The latter two are refutations by negation.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c12_5']	將未生同已生。	將未生同已生。	If what has not yet arisen is the same as what has already arisen,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c12_11']	則應恒不生。	則應恒不生。	then it should never arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c13_1']	前中第二牒計破中。	前中第二牒計破中。	In the second refutation of the objection within the first,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c13_4']	量云。	量云。	the argument is as follows:
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c13_12']	因應生果已更生。	因應生果已更生。	The cause should give rise to the effect that has already arisen again,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c13_20']	以因中常有果故。	以因中常有果故。	because the effect is always present in the cause,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c14_5']	如未生果因。	如未生果因。	like the cause of an effect that has not yet arisen.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c14_16']	以未生與生因位不改故。	以未生與生因位不改故。	This is because the state of the cause of what has not yet arisen and what has arisen does not change.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c15_10']	又以已生之果不異未生時故。	又以已生之果不異未生時故。	Moreover, this is because the effect that has already arisen is no different from the time when it had not yet arisen.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c16_2']	是故因中恒有常生也。	是故因中恒有常生也。	Therefore, there is always constant arising within the cause.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c16_12']	從是有邊復應更生者。	從是有邊復應更生者。	From this, there should be further arising of what has an end,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c17_6']	謂此果法在因出因俱是有故。	謂此果法在因出因俱是有故。	that is to say, because this dharma of the effect is in the cause and comes out of the cause, it is always existent.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c17_11']	在因既生。	在因既生。	Since it has already arisen while in the cause,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c17_18']	出因何得不生。	出因何得不生。	how could it not arise when coming out of the cause?
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c18_5']	是故生已更生。	是故生已更生。	Therefore, what has already arisen arises again.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c18_10']	是則無窮。	是則無窮。	This is then endless.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c18_17']	此是重生無窮。	此是重生無窮。	This is the endless rebirth.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c19_3']	三遮救破。	三遮救破。	Third, refuting the rescue,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c19_10']	亦是恒不生破。	亦是恒不生破。	which is also the refutation of never arising.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c19_18']	於中先牒外救云。	於中先牒外救云。	Within this, first it cites the opponent's rescue, saying:
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c20_4']	已生是事成。	已生是事成。	The arising of this event has already been accomplished.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c20_10']	事成不須生。	事成不須生。	When the event is accomplished, there is no need for further arising.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c20_16']	未生是性有。	未生是性有。	The nature of what has not yet arisen exists.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c21_2']	性有故須生。	性有故須生。	Because the nature exists, it needs to arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c21_7']	後正破云。	後正破云。	Later, the correct refutation states:
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c21_12']	無生理者。	無生理者。	As for the principle of non-arising,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c21_18']	既已生是有。	既已生是有。	since what has already arisen exists,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c22_3']	而不更生。	而不更生。	it does not arise again.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c22_8']	未生亦有。	未生亦有。	What has not yet arisen also exists.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c22_13']	應亦不生。	應亦不生。	It should also not arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c22_20']	故云終無生理。	故云終無生理。	Therefore, it is said that there is ultimately no principle of arising.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c23_4']	亦有量云。	亦有量云。	There is also a logical argument:
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c23_12']	未生因應不生果。	未生因應不生果。	The cause of what has not yet arisen should not give rise to the effect.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c24_3']	以因中有果無生理故。	以因中有果無生理故。	Because the principle of the existence of the effect within the cause does not arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c24_9']	如已生果因。	如已生果因。	Like the already arisen effect and cause.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c24_16']	此是常不生過。	此是常不生過。	This is the fault of permanence and non-arising.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c25_2']	若以已同未。	若以已同未。	If what has already arisen is the same as what has not yet arisen,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c25_7']	則應常生。	則應常生。	then it should always arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c25_13']	若以未同已。	若以未同已。	If what has not yet arisen is the same as what has already arisen,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c25_19']	則應常不生。	則應常不生。	then it should always not arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c26_3']	由具斯失。	由具斯失。	Because of these faults,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c26_12']	是故第四總結無生。	是故第四總結無生。	therefore, the fourth concludes that there is no arising.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c27_1']	第二俱有不齊破。	第二俱有不齊破。	The second refutation is that both together are not equal.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c27_5', 'ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c27_11', 'ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c27_19']	破意云。🔽若已未俱有。🔽遂得一生一不生。	破意云。 若已未俱有。 遂得一生一不生。	The meaning of the refutation is as follows:🔽If what has already arisen and what has not yet arisen both exist,🔽then one can arise and one does not arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c28_7']	亦可已生與未生。	亦可已生與未生。	It is also possible that what has already arisen and what has not yet arisen,🔽...
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c28_13']	一有一不有。	一有一不有。	One is existent, one is not existent.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c29_4']	若言未是性有故有生。	若言未是性有故有生。	If it is said that because it is not yet existent by nature, it has arising,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0221c29_12']	已是事有故不生。	已是事有故不生。	Since it is already an existent thing, it does not arise.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a01_1']	亦可生亦有二生。	亦可生亦有二生。	It can also be said that there are two kinds of arising:
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a01_7']	一是性生故。	一是性生故。	One is arising by nature,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a01_13']	二是事生故。	二是事生故。	And the other is arising as an existent thing.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a01_18']	不生文中。	不生文中。	In the section on non-arising,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a02_1']	初牒執。	初牒執。	First, it cites the assertion,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a02_5']	後正破。	後正破。	And then refutes it.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a02_8', 'ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a02_16']	可知。🔽第三已未相違破。	可知。 第三已未相違破。	It can be understood.🔽The third refutation of the contradiction between the already arisen and the not yet arisen,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a03_1']	此中先正破。	此中先正破。	First, it directly refutes,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a03_5']	後釋成。	後釋成。	And then explains.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a03_8']	初者。	初者。	First,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a03_17']	生與未生既是相違。	生與未生既是相違。	Since arising and non-arising are contradictory,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a04_2']	未生是有。	未生是有。	Non-arising is existent,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a04_7']	生已應無。	生已應無。	And arising should be non-existent.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a04_12']	以相違故。	以相違故。	Because they are contradictory,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a04_17']	如明闇等。	如明闇等。	Like light and darkness, etc.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a05_5']	釋中二作亦相違者。	釋中二作亦相違者。	In the explanation, the two actions are also contradictory.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a05_12']	未生以有作相。	未生以有作相。	Non-arising has the characteristic of having action,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a06_1']	生已亦以有作相。	生已亦以有作相。	And arising also has the characteristic of having action.
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a06_8']	已未既其相反。	已未既其相反。	Since the already arisen and the not yet arisen are opposed to each other,
['ZH_T42_1826_002:0222a06_15']	作相那不相違。	作相那不相違。	How can the characteristics of action not be contradictory?
