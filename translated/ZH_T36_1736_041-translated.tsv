['ZH_T36_1736_041:0311c22_12']	疏「釋此四分具如雜集第十三」者，然此論建立補特伽羅，略有七種，謂病行差別故、出離差別故、任持差別故、方便差別故、果差別故、界差別故、修行差別故。	疏「釋此四分具如雜集第十三」者，然此論建立補特伽羅，略有七種，謂病行差別故、出離差別故、任持差別故、方便差別故、果差別故、界差別故、修行差別故。	041	Tang Dynasty monk Chengguan of the Great Huayan Monastery on Mount Qingliang explains: The explanation of these four parts is complete in the thirteenth chapter of the Saṃyuktâbhidharmahṛdaya. This treatise establishes seven kinds of pudgalas, namely, due to the difference in illness and practice, the difference in liberation, the difference in upholding, the difference in expedient means, the difference in fruit, the difference in realm, and the difference in cultivation.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0311c23_4']	今當病行差別，自有七種：	今當病行差別，自有七種：	041	Now, this is the difference in illness and practice, which itself has seven kinds:
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0311c24_14']	一貪行、二瞋行、三癡行、四慢行、五尋伺行、六等分行、七薄塵行。	一貪行、二瞋行、三癡行、四慢行、五尋伺行、六等分行、七薄塵行。	041	1. Greed-practice, 2. anger-practice, 3. delusion-practice, 4. arrogance-practice, 5. investigation-and-reflection practice, 6. equal-parts practice, 7. thin defilement practice.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0311c28_17']	言貪行補特伽羅者，謂有猛利長時貪欲標也，雖於下劣可愛境界，而能發起上品貪欲此釋猛利，起即長時無有斷滅此釋長時，如貪行者，乃至尋伺行者亦爾，各隨自境猛利長行，如理配釋。	言貪行補特伽羅者，謂有猛利長時貪欲標也，雖於下劣可愛境界，而能發起上品貪欲此釋猛利，起即長時無有斷滅此釋長時，如貪行者，乃至尋伺行者亦爾，各隨自境猛利長行，如理配釋。	041	As for the person with a predominance of craving, it means one with intense and long-lasting craving. Even towards inferior and attractive objects, they can give rise to intense craving. This explains intense. It arises for a long time without interruption. This explains long-lasting. Like one with a predominance of craving, up to one with a predominance of discursive thought is the same. Each should be explained according to their own objects, intensity, and duration.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a02_1']	等分補特伽羅者，謂住自性位煩惱，遠離猛劣，住平等境煩惱故、隨境勢力煩惱現行故。	等分補特伽羅者，謂住自性位煩惱，遠離猛劣，住平等境煩惱故、隨境勢力煩惱現行故。	041	As for the person with an equal share of afflictions, it means one who abides in the state of natural afflictions, far from intense and weak, abiding in afflictions towards equal objects, and giving rise to afflictions in accordance with the power of objects.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a02_4']	釋曰：	釋曰：	041	The commentary says:
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a03_3']	猛揀前五，劣揀第七，住平等境釋成自性。	猛揀前五，劣揀第七，住平等境釋成自性。	041	Intense distinguishes from the previous five, weak distinguishes from the seventh. Abiding in afflictions towards equal objects explains the natural state.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a06_3']	隨境勢力煩惱現行，釋自性煩惱，謂勝境貪心即增、劣境貪心則下，不同前五於下劣境起上品貪等，亦猶顏回怒不過分等。	隨境勢力煩惱現行，釋自性煩惱，謂勝境貪心即增、劣境貪心則下，不同前五於下劣境起上品貪等，亦猶顏回怒不過分等。	041	The power of the object's influence causes the afflictions to manifest. This explains the intrinsic nature of afflictions. It means that when the object is superior, the greedy mind increases, and when the object is inferior, the greedy mind decreases. It is different from the first five [categories] that give rise to superior greed, etc. towards inferior objects. It is also like Yan Hui who did not get angry excessively, etc.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a06_12']	或與境等名為等分。	或與境等名為等分。	041	Or it is called equal division because it is equal to the object.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a07_9']	又於所起無偏勝劣，故云等也。	又於所起無偏勝劣，故云等也。	041	Moreover, there is no partiality or superiority in what is produced, so it is called equal.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a08_11']	論云「薄塵行補特伽羅者，謂住自性位薄煩惱。	論云「薄塵行補特伽羅者，謂住自性位薄煩惱。	041	The treatise says: The person who practices with weak afflictions abides in the intrinsic nature state with weak afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a09_14']	如前所說自性位煩惱相，今此煩惱望彼微薄故。	如前所說自性位煩惱相，今此煩惱望彼微薄故。	041	As explained before, the characteristics of the afflictions in the intrinsic nature state are now weaker than those.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a11_8']	雖於增上所緣境界，而微薄性煩惱現行，昔所修習勝對治力所推伏故。	雖於增上所緣境界，而微薄性煩惱現行，昔所修習勝對治力所推伏故。	041	Although the afflictions manifest in superior objects, their nature is weak, because they are suppressed by the power of the superior antidotes cultivated in the past.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a11_12']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	041	The commentary says:
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a12_11']	非如前等分等於前境，境勝則貪重等；	非如前等分等於前境，境勝則貪重等；	041	It is not like the equal division that is equal to the previous object. When the object is superior, greed increases, etc.;
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a13_11']	今勝亦劣，故不同前，則父母之讐亦無加報。	今勝亦劣，故不同前，則父母之讐亦無加報。	041	Now, the superior is also inferior, so it is different from the previous. Then, even the enemy of one's parents has no retribution.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a14_14']	又上有七，經多說四者，取其三毒為不善根故。	又上有七，經多說四者，取其三毒為不善根故。	041	Moreover, above there are seven, and the sūtras often speak of four because the three poisons are taken as the roots of unwholesomeness.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a15_11']	等分之中攝餘三故，故疏云等分。	等分之中攝餘三故，故疏云等分。	041	Because the rest of the three are included in the equal division, therefore the commentary says equal division.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a16_7']	分其輕重，輕即薄塵，重即正是。	分其輕重，輕即薄塵，重即正是。	041	Distinguishing between light and heavy, light is thin dust, and heavy is precisely that.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a17_4']	等分既等於境，望於薄塵故為重耳。	等分既等於境，望於薄塵故為重耳。	041	Since equal division is equal to the object, it is heavy in comparison to thin dust.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a17_15']	又等皆相似，無有勝劣；	又等皆相似，無有勝劣；	041	Moreover, the equal is all similar, without superiority or inferiority;
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a18_5']	前三則有互增之義。	前三則有互增之義。	041	The first three have the meaning of mutual increase.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a19_3']	疏「五求人天樂為樂生死」者，恐有難云：	疏「五求人天樂為樂生死」者，恐有難云：	041	The commentary says seeking the bliss of humans and gods is taking birth and death as bliss. There may be a difficulty:
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a19_8']	誰復樂死？	誰復樂死？	041	Who would enjoy death?
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a19_13']	故今答云：	故今答云：	041	Therefore, the answer now is:
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a20_15']	所謂樂生，以生必死故，人天之樂是生死中事故。	所謂樂生，以生必死故，人天之樂是生死中事故。	041	That is to say, taking birth as bliss, because birth must end in death, the bliss of humans and gods is an event within birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a21_18']	疏「樂事寂者令成理寂」者，即為人意，亦即對治。	疏「樂事寂者令成理寂」者，即為人意，亦即對治。	041	The commentary says causing those who enjoy events to achieve the tranquility of principle, which is the intention for others, and also the antidote.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a23_17']	疏「即依法不依人」者，即第一文連義正對，即依義不依文也，疏以文義顯故，更不釋之。	疏「即依法不依人」者，即第一文連義正對，即依義不依文也，疏以文義顯故，更不釋之。	041	The commentary's relying on the Dharma, not relying on the person is the first text connected with the meaning, which directly corresponds to relying on the meaning, not relying on the words. The commentary clarifies the meaning with words, so it does not further explain it.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a25_9']	第二句中有其兩對，即依法不依人、依智不依識，具法四依也。	第二句中有其兩對，即依法不依人、依智不依識，具法四依也。	041	The second sentence has two pairs: relying on the Dharma, not relying on the person, and relying on wisdom, not relying on consciousness, which are the four reliances on the Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a27_1']	即《淨名經．法供養品》而以義語、智識、了義不了義、人法而為其次。	即《淨名經．法供養品》而以義語、智識、了義不了義、人法而為其次。	041	It is the Chapter on the Offerings of the Dharma in the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra, which takes meaning, wisdom, definitive meaning, and non-definitive meaning, and person and Dharma as the sequence.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312a27_11']	四依之義，三門分別：	四依之義，三門分別：	041	The meaning of the four reliances is distinguished in three aspects:

['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312b01_19']	智無分別，能決斷故，是以應依。	智無分別，能決斷故，是以應依。	041	Wisdom is non-discriminating and able to decisively understand, therefore one should rely on it.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312b02_15']	識為了別，能起於染著，故不應依。	識為了別，能起於染著，故不應依。	041	Consciousness is for the sake of discrimination and can give rise to defilement and attachment, so it should not be relied upon.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312b04_9']	「依了義經不依不了義」者，顯實分明名為了義，憑之起解，是故應依；	「依了義經不依不了義」者，顯實分明名為了義，憑之起解，是故應依；	041	Rely on the definitive meaning sutras, not on the non-definitive meaning sutras means that that which reveals reality clearly is called definitive meaning, and one should rely on it to give rise to understanding;

['ZH_T36_1736_041:0312b09_5']	二大小乘門。	二大小乘門。	041	2. The approach of the Great and Lesser Vehicles.

Therefore, sages who have a little thought do not attain the holy fruits.

['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317b24_18']	而云各者，正取上半觀相、下半觀益，為各二義，即依他、圓成，如下疏列。	而云各者，正取上半觀相、下半觀益，為各二義，即依他、圓成，如下疏列。	041	It says each because it takes the first half as the appearance of contemplation and the second half as the benefits of contemplation, as the two meanings of each. The dependent and perfect [natures] are listed below in the commentary.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317b26_6']	而下遣能亦含依圓，故此各言兼於能所，方順二偈兼修之言。	而下遣能亦含依圓，故此各言兼於能所，方順二偈兼修之言。	041	The elimination of the able [to perceive] also contains the dependent and perfect [natures], thus this word each also includes the able and the perceived, only then following the two verses' words of cultivating both.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317b27_10']	疏「一者成前」下，別示二義之相，此即依他中義也。	疏「一者成前」下，別示二義之相，此即依他中義也。	041	The commentary states first, completing the previous and below specifically shows the characteristics of the two meanings, which is the meaning within the dependent [nature].

['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317c01_6']	此偈遣所相色心法體，由四相相成其有為，當法緣生故無自性。	此偈遣所相色心法體，由四相相成其有為，當法緣生故無自性。	041	This verse refutes the characterized form and mind dharmas, because the four characteristics form its conditioned arising, and the present dharma is born from conditions, thus having no self-nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317c01_12']	觀益，可知。	觀益，可知。	041	The benefits of contemplation can be known.

['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317c06_12']	前義依他圓成俱無所了，後義依圓皆無能了，皆由即性即無性故，故疏結云「能所雙亡」，即正結上二義也，亦通結上二偈能所。	前義依他圓成俱無所了，後義依圓皆無能了，皆由即性即無性故，故疏結云「能所雙亡」，即正結上二義也，亦通結上二偈能所。	041	The former meaning is that both the dependent and perfected [natures] have nothing to be cognized, while the latter meaning is that both the dependent and perfected [natures] have no ability to cognize, all because they are identical to nature and identical to non-nature. Therefore, the commentary concludes by saying both subject and object are utterly absent, which directly concludes the above two meanings, and also generally concludes the subject and object of the above two verses.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317c09_10']	疏「不了國等依他謂為現見」者，而言等者，國即共業緣生，以後偈總結云「世間國土性」，世間之言通有情世間，故致「等」言。	疏「不了國等依他謂為現見」者，而言等者，國即共業緣生，以後偈總結云「世間國土性」，世間之言通有情世間，故致「等」言。	041	The commentary states: Not understanding that the country and so forth are dependent on others, one takes them to be direct perception. The word and so forth means that the country is born from the shared karma of sentient beings. The following verse concludes by saying the nature of the world and countries. The word world includes the world of sentient beings, hence the word and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317c10_12']	言謂為現見者，以《中論》內小乘被破，皆悉救云：	言謂為現見者，以《中論》內小乘被破，皆悉救云：	041	As for the statement taking them to be direct perception, when the Hinayana was refuted in the Madhyamaka-śāstra, they all defended by saying:
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317c10_18']	世間現見故。	世間現見故。	041	Because it is directly seen in the world.
['ZH_T36_1736_041:0317c11_7']	意云不合與世間相違。	意云不合與世間相違。	041	The meaning is that it should not contradict the world.
