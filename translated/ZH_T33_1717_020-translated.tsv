Next, below if it is the five periods, it is used to investigate and analyze. It analyzes the teachings and doctrines used by the three in the south and the seven in the north in order. It can be seen by searching, and it is not divided again.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956a22_17']	「全失三門亦失七門」者，以般若中有共不共故，不共雖有別圓不同，且總言之名為「不空」，對共中四以為八門；	「全失三門亦失七門」者，以般若中有共不共故，不共雖有別圓不同，且總言之名為「不空」，對共中四以為八門；	Completely losing three gates is also losing seven gates means that within prajñā there are shared and unshared [gates]. Although the unshared [gates] are different in the Shared and Distinct [Teachings], they are generally referred to as not empty and are opposed to the four shared [gates] to form eight gates.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956a23_18']	既但得一，全失共三及不共四，故云「失七」。	既但得一，全失共三及不共四，故云「失七」。	Since one only obtains one [gate], one completely loses the three shared and the four unshared [gates], thus it is said losing seven.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956a26_15']	「此得斥小一種聲聞，全失七種聲聞者」，藏通八門各有聲聞，若斥有相，但斥三藏有門一種，全失餘三及通中四，故云「失七」。	「此得斥小一種聲聞，全失七種聲聞者」，藏通八門各有聲聞，若斥有相，但斥三藏有門一種，全失餘三及通中四，故云「失七」。	This obtains the refutation of one kind of Hīnayāna śrāvakas, completely losing seven kinds of śrāvakas means that the eight gates of the Tripiṭaka and Shared [Teachings] each have śrāvakas. If one refutes with characteristics, one only refutes the one kind of gate with characteristics in the Tripiṭaka [Teaching], completely losing the remaining three and the four in the Shared [Teaching], thus it is said losing seven.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956a27_5']	「會五」者，五謂人天及三。	「會五」者，五謂人天及三。	Uniting five means the five are humans, gods, and the three [vehicles].
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956a28_3']	「不會七」者，「七」謂聲聞支佛各有二故。	「不會七」者，「七」謂聲聞支佛各有二故。	Not uniting seven means the seven are the two śrāvakas and the two pratyekabuddhas.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b01_2']	「永失七術」者，常樂等四及非常非無常等四，總成八術，故知但常唯得八術中之一耳。	「永失七術」者，常樂等四及非常非無常等四，總成八術，故知但常唯得八術中之一耳。	Permanently losing the seven techniques means the four of permanence, bliss, self, and purity, and the four of impermanence, suffering, no-self, and impurity, totaling eight techniques. Therefore, it is known that one who only believes in permanence can only obtain one of the eight techniques.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b01_16']	又「八術」如《止觀》第八記。	又「八術」如《止觀》第八記。	Moreover, the eight techniques are as explained in the eighth record of the Mohe Zhiguan.

['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b09_17']	或「娑羅」翻為「鴛鴦」，引證云「問中云娑羅，答中云鴛鴦，類異義同」，故以鴛鴦替於娑羅。	或「娑羅」翻為「鴛鴦」，引證云「問中云娑羅，答中云鴛鴦，類異義同」，故以鴛鴦替於娑羅。	Or śāla is translated as pair of mandarin ducks, citing the evidence saying the question says śāla, the answer says mandarin ducks, the species are different but the meaning is the same, so mandarin ducks replace śāla.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b10_25']	或云「娑羅」翻為「天鶴」，引六卷《泥洹》云「雁鶴舍利」。	或云「娑羅」翻為「天鶴」，引六卷《泥洹》云「雁鶴舍利」。	Or it is said śāla is translated as celestial crane, citing the six-fascicle Nirvana Sutra saying geese and cranes are śāriputra.

The intention is in the analogy, taking the male and female to play and rest together, comparing the one containing the innumerable, and the innumerable containing the one.

['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b16_16']	若觀常時不識生死無常，若觀生死無常不識涅槃常住，二解不分，如識金不識鍮、識鍮不識金，精識二物是名雙觀；	若觀常時不識生死無常，若觀生死無常不識涅槃常住，二解不分，如識金不識鍮、識鍮不識金，精識二物是名雙觀；	If contemplating permanence, one does not recognize the impermanence of birth and death; if contemplating the impermanence of birth and death, one does not recognize the permanence of nirvāṇa. The two understandings are not distinguished, like recognizing gold but not recognizing brass, recognizing brass but not recognizing gold. Precisely recognizing the two things is called the double contemplation;
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b17_3']	餘三亦爾。	餘三亦爾。	The other three are also like this.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b17_13']	凡聖俱然，故云雙遊。	凡聖俱然，故云雙遊。	Since both ordinary and sages are thus, it is said that they both roam.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b19_6']	此釋違喻，一鳥窮下之生死，一鳥窮高之涅槃，升沈永乖，雙遊何在？	此釋違喻，一鳥窮下之生死，一鳥窮高之涅槃，升沈永乖，雙遊何在？	This explanation contradicts the analogy. One bird reaches the end of the lower realm of birth and death, while the other bird reaches the height of nirvana. The ascent and sinking are eternally incompatible, so where is the double roaming?
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b19_17']	又有人約半滿以明雙遊。	又有人約半滿以明雙遊。	Moreover, some people explain double roaming in terms of the half and full teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b22_5']	夫雙遊者，生死涅槃各有常與無常，取生死涅槃中雙常為一雙滿，取生死涅槃中一雙無常為一雙半。	夫雙遊者，生死涅槃各有常與無常，取生死涅槃中雙常為一雙滿，取生死涅槃中一雙無常為一雙半。	The double roamers take the double permanence in birth and death and nirvana as one pair of the full, and take the double impermanence in birth and death and nirvana as one pair of the half.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b24_1']	今明不爾，兩常俱起乃是二雄，兩無常俱起乃是二雌，亦與喻乖，是故不用。	今明不爾，兩常俱起乃是二雄，兩無常俱起乃是二雌，亦與喻乖，是故不用。	Now, this is not so. The two permanences arising together are the two males, and the two impermanences arising together are the two females. This also contradicts the analogy, so it is not used.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b27_1']	今言雙遊者，生死涅槃中俱有常無常，在下在高雙遊並息，事理相即，二即中、中即二，非二中而二中，事理雌雄義並成也。	今言雙遊者，生死涅槃中俱有常無常，在下在高雙遊並息，事理相即，二即中、中即二，非二中而二中，事理雌雄義並成也。	Now, the double roamers take the permanence and impermanence in birth and death and nirvana as both roaming and both ceasing, the phenomenal and the principle mutually including each other, the two are the middle, the middle is the two, not two and middle yet two and middle, the meaning of the phenomenal and principle, male and female, is all accomplished.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b28_6']	故此雙遊須約六即，此中具有凡共聖等，如前三句。	故此雙遊須約六即，此中具有凡共聖等，如前三句。	Therefore, this double cultivation must be based on the six identities. In this, there are ordinary beings and sages, etc., as in the previous three sentences.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956b29_18']	用一音者，「有慧方便解」等者，慧即是實，方便是權，二義相即不得相離。	用一音者，「有慧方便解」等者，慧即是實，方便是權，二義相即不得相離。	As for using one sound, those with wisdom and skillful means - wisdom is the real, and skillful means is the provisional. The two meanings are mutually inclusive and cannot be separated.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c03_6']	他用五時但得方便而無實慧，故《淨名》云「無慧方便縛」，故無實慧而用方便，名愛見悲，即三藏菩薩也。	他用五時但得方便而無實慧，故《淨名》云「無慧方便縛」，故無實慧而用方便，名愛見悲，即三藏菩薩也。	Others use the five periods, but only attain skillful means and lack true wisdom. Therefore, the Vimalakirti Sutra says bound by the lack of wisdom and skillful means. Therefore, lacking true wisdom and using skillful means is called the compassion of craving and views, which is the bodhisattvas of the Tripiṭaka Teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c04_6']	總而言之，除無緣外，皆悉名為方便縛也。	總而言之，除無緣外，皆悉名為方便縛也。	To put it simply, except for the unconditioned, all are called the bondage of skillful means.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c05_4']	是則別教地前，通教出假，皆名愛見。	是則別教地前，通教出假，皆名愛見。	This means that in the Distinct Teaching, those below the grounds, and in the Shared Teaching, those who manifest in the conventional world, are all called craving and views.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c07_4']	若但一音而無權慧，何但方便是縛，慧亦非解，故《淨名》云「無方便慧縛」，即二眾空慧也。	若但一音而無權慧，何但方便是縛，慧亦非解，故《淨名》云「無方便慧縛」，即二眾空慧也。	If there is only one sound and no provisional wisdom, not only is skillful means a bondage, but wisdom is also not liberation. Therefore, the Vimalakirti Sutra says bound by the lack of skillful means and wisdom, which refers to the wisdom of emptiness in the two vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c08_4']	總而言之，通別入空菩薩，皆名無方便慧。	總而言之，通別入空菩薩，皆名無方便慧。	To put it simply, the bodhisattvas who enter emptiness through the general and specific [teachings] are all called lacking skillful means and wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c10_15']	今用此意，斥彼用教，諸味用實，雖名一音，若無赴緣，彈斥洮汰成生熟蘇，使至法華堪入一實，名無方便。	今用此意，斥彼用教，諸味用實，雖名一音，若無赴緣，彈斥洮汰成生熟蘇，使至法華堪入一實，名無方便。	Now, using this meaning, I refute their use of the teachings. Although the various flavors use the real [truth], if there is no response to conditions, and if there is no rebuke, washing, and maturing of raw and cooked ghee, causing [beings] to reach the Lotus Sutra and be able to enter the one true [reality], it is called lacking skillful means.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c12_2']	若用五時漸誘之益，則失諸味平等一音，名為無慧。	若用五時漸誘之益，則失諸味平等一音，名為無慧。	If one uses the benefit of the gradual guidance of the five periods, then one loses the equality and one sound of the various flavors, and it is called lacking wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0956c12_7']	故今斥之。	故今斥之。	Therefore, I now refute it.

['ZH_T33_1717_020:0957b03_18']	次「始自」去始自人天終至佛乘，亦名為漸，此是約人。	次「始自」去始自人天終至佛乘，亦名為漸，此是約人。	Next, from starting from below, starting from the human and heavenly up to the Buddha vehicle, is also called gradual, this is about the person.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0957b07_6']	人雖在於諸味漸稟，而得益深淺始自人天次第入實，此如《止觀》初破三途後達常住，此人不經華嚴，但從鹿苑之前，初稟人天後漸深入。	人雖在於諸味漸稟，而得益深淺始自人天次第入實，此如《止觀》初破三途後達常住，此人不經華嚴，但從鹿苑之前，初稟人天後漸深入。	Although people gradually receive teachings in the various flavors, they gain deeper and shallower benefits. They start from the human and heavenly realms and enter the truth in order. This is like the initial breaking of the three evil paths in the Śamathavipaśyanā, followed by reaching the eternal abode. This person does not go through the Flower Ornament, but only from before the Deer Park, first receiving the human and heavenly realms, and later gradually entering deeply.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0957b09_14']	言「中間」者，或復初從方等般若，後漸漸深入，皆如前說，並名為漸，以鹿苑後皆有人天乃至實相故也。	言「中間」者，或復初從方等般若，後漸漸深入，皆如前說，並名為漸，以鹿苑後皆有人天乃至實相故也。	As for in the middle, it means that some first follow the Vaipulya and Prajñā, and later gradually enter deeply, all as explained above. They are all called gradual, because after the Deer Park there are those who receive the human and heavenly realms up to the true aspect.

Although the teachings go through the gradual, they may gain sudden benefits. Those who have not yet entered, if they come to the Lotus Sutra, will be opened and united, and are also called gradual and sudden. This is a separate approach, not entirely called gradual.

This is like the five thousand who again become indefinite.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0957b24_18']	言「菩薩」者，即藏通菩薩，至涅槃中方得聞常破於無明，亦屬不定，是等皆名發不定故。	言「菩薩」者，即藏通菩薩，至涅槃中方得聞常破於無明，亦屬不定，是等皆名發不定故。	As for bodhisattvas, they refer to those of the Tripitaka and Shared Teachings. They only attain to hear about permanence and destroy ignorance in the Nirvana Sutra, and are also included in the indeterminate. All of these are called arousing the indeterminate.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0957b27_7']	言「七種方便皆入究竟」者，今釋不定，非但涅槃之中七種方便皆得入實名為不定，前諸教中亦復如是。	言「七種方便皆入究竟」者，今釋不定，非但涅槃之中七種方便皆得入實名為不定，前諸教中亦復如是。	As for the seven kinds of skillful means all enter the ultimate, now explaining the indeterminate, it is not only in the Nirvana Sutra that the seven kinds of skillful means all attain to enter the truth and are called indeterminate, it is also like this in the previous teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0957b28_15']	若圓教中及別登地得入實者不名不定，故不定名必在方便。	若圓教中及別登地得入實者不名不定，故不定名必在方便。	If in the Perfect Teaching and the Distinct Teaching one ascends the grounds and attains to enter the truth, it is not called indeterminate. Therefore, the name indeterminate must be in the skillful means.

If that Cessation and Contemplation only discusses the practice of receiving from a teacher, it is indeterminate. Therefore, that text says either gradual, sudden, cessation, or contemplation.
['ZH_T33_1717_020:0957c08_1']	既云天台傳於南嶽，不可從師傳於所發，是故不同。	既云天台傳於南嶽，不可從師傳於所發，是故不同。	Since it is said that Tiantai transmitted from Nanyue, it cannot be transmitted from a teacher to what is aroused. Therefore, it is different.
