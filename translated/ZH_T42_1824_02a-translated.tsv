['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c07_12']	所以世諦破性實生滅者。	所以世諦破性實生滅者。	The reason for the conventional truth refuting inherent true arising and ceasing is as follows:
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c08_1']	良由實生即墮常。	良由實生即墮常。	The reason is that if there is truly arising, it falls into permanence.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c08_7']	實滅即墮斷。	實滅即墮斷。	If there is truly ceasing, it falls into annihilation.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c08_17']	是故世諦破實生滅也。	是故世諦破實生滅也。	Therefore, the conventional truth refutes true arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c09_7']	二者顯成世諦中道義。	二者顯成世諦中道義。	Second, it reveals the meaning of the middle way within the conventional truth.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c10_2']	所以世諦假生假滅是中道者。	所以世諦假生假滅是中道者。	The reason why the conventional truth's provisional arising and provisional ceasing is the middle way is as follows.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c10_13']	良由假生非定生故不常。	良由假生非定生故不常。	The reason is that provisional arising is not definite arising, so it is not permanent.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c11_3']	假滅非定滅故不斷。	假滅非定滅故不斷。	Provisional ceasing is not definite ceasing, so it is not annihilated.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c11_12']	不斷不常故名中道。	不斷不常故名中道。	Not annihilated and not permanent, it is called the middle way.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c12_7']	故舉不常不斷釋成世諦中道也。	故舉不常不斷釋成世諦中道也。	Therefore, it raises not permanent and not annihilated to explain the middle way of the conventional truth.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c12_17']	問不常不斷既是中道。	問不常不斷既是中道。	Question: If not permanent and not annihilated is the middle way,
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c13_7']	不生不滅亦是中道。	不生不滅亦是中道。	not arising and not ceasing is also the middle way.

['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c16_11']	所以然者以經論之中多就不常不斷明中道。	所以然者以經論之中多就不常不斷明中道。	The reason is that in the sūtras and treatises, the middle way is often clarified based on not permanent and not annihilated.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c17_1']	涅槃師子吼品云。	涅槃師子吼品云。	The chapter on the lion's roar in the Nirvana Sutra says:

['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c20_9']	以經論多就不常不斷明中道其義顯彰。	以經論多就不常不斷明中道其義顯彰。	Because the sūtras and treatises often clarify the middle way in terms of neither permanence nor annihilation, the meaning becomes evident.

['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c21_6']	故舉不常不斷釋成中道。	故舉不常不斷釋成中道。	Therefore, using neither permanence nor annihilation, it explains and establishes the middle way.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c22_4']	三者上雖言世諦因果相生是假生滅。	三者上雖言世諦因果相生是假生滅。	Third, although it was said above that the arising of cause and effect in the conventional truth is provisional arising and ceasing,

['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c24_1', 'ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c24_12']	所以然者既稱假生。🔽或可謂因中有果故假生。	所以然者既稱假生。 或可謂因中有果故假生。	The reason for this is that since it is called provisional arising,🔽it may be said that there are effects within the cause, and therefore it is provisionally arising.
['ZH_T42_1824_02a:0023c25_3']	或是因中無果故假生。	或是因中無果故假生。	Or it may be said that there are no effects within the cause, and therefore it is provisionally arising.
