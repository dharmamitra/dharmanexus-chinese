['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a07_18']	為欲簡持能立、能破義中真實，故造斯論。	為欲簡持能立、能破義中真實，故造斯論。	In order to distinguish and uphold the true meaning of proof and refutation, this treatise is composed.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a08_17']	宗等多言說能立，　　是中唯隨自意樂；	宗等多言說能立，　　是中唯隨自意樂；	The many statements of thesis, etc. are able to prove, which is only in accordance with one's own intention;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a09_17']	為所成立說名宗，　　非彼相違義能遣。	為所成立說名宗，　　非彼相違義能遣。	What is stated for the sake of being established is called a thesis, and the meaning that contradicts it cannot be refuted.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a11_19']	「宗等多言說能立」者，由宗、因、喻多言辯說，他未了義，故此多言於《論式》等說名能立。	「宗等多言說能立」者，由宗、因、喻多言辯說，他未了義，故此多言於《論式》等說名能立。	As for the many statements of thesis, etc. are able to prove, because the meaning that is not yet understood by others is debated through the many statements of thesis, reason, and example, these many statements are called able to prove in treatises, etc.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a13_12']	又以一言說能立者，為顯總成一能立性，由此應知隨有所闕名能立過。	又以一言說能立者，為顯總成一能立性，由此應知隨有所闕名能立過。	Moreover, when it is said that one statement is able to prove, it is in order to show that it collectively forms the nature of being able to prove. Therefore, it should be understood that if there is any deficiency, it is a fault of being able to prove.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a15_1']	言「是中」者，起論端義，或簡持義，是宗等中，故名是中。	言「是中」者，起論端義，或簡持義，是宗等中，故名是中。	As for the word here, it has the meaning of initiating a discussion, or the meaning of distinguishing and upholding. It is among the theses, etc., and is therefore called here.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a15_13']	所言「唯」者，是簡別義。	所言「唯」者，是簡別義。	As for the word only, it has the meaning of distinguishing.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a16_6']	「隨自意」顯不顧論宗，隨自意立。	「隨自意」顯不顧論宗，隨自意立。	According to one's own intention shows not caring about the established doctrines, but establishing according to one's own intention.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a17_1']	「樂」為所立，謂不樂為能成立性。	「樂」為所立，謂不樂為能成立性。	Pleasure is what is established, meaning not taking pleasure as the nature of what is to be established.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a18_1']	若異此者說所成立，似因、似喻應亦名宗。	若異此者說所成立，似因、似喻應亦名宗。	If it were otherwise, what is to be established would be called a thesis, like an inference or an example.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a19_4']	為顯離餘立宗過失，故言「非彼相違義能遣」。	為顯離餘立宗過失，故言「非彼相違義能遣」。	In order to show the faults of establishing a thesis apart from the others, it says the meaning that is contrary to it cannot be refuted.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a20_4']	若非違義言聲所遣，如立「一切言皆是妄」；	若非違義言聲所遣，如立「一切言皆是妄」；	If the meaning that is not contrary is refuted by the sound of words, like establishing all words are false;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a21_3']	或先所立宗義相違，如獯狐子立「聲為常」；	或先所立宗義相違，如獯狐子立「聲為常」；	or if it contradicts the meaning of the thesis that was previously established, like the son of a fox establishing sound is permanent;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a22_19']	又若於中由不共故，無有比量，為極成言相違義遣，如說「懷兔，非月有故」；	又若於中由不共故，無有比量，為極成言相違義遣，如說「懷兔，非月有故」；	and moreover, if it is because it is unique, there is no valid cognition, and it is refuted by the meaning that contradicts the word established, like saying the rabbit is not in the moon because it does not exist;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a24_19']	又於有法，即彼所立為此極成現量、比量相違義遣，如有成立「聲非所聞」「瓶是常」等。	又於有法，即彼所立為此極成現量、比量相違義遣，如有成立「聲非所聞」「瓶是常」等。	Moreover, regarding existent dharmas, the meaning contradicted by the presently established direct perception and inference established by them is eliminated, just as in the establishment of sound is not audible and pot is permanent, etc.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a25_17']	諸有說言宗因相違名「宗違」者，此非宗過；	諸有說言宗因相違名「宗違」者，此非宗過；	Those who say that the contradiction between the thesis and reason is called contradiction with the thesis are not at fault in the thesis;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a27_15']	以於此中立「聲為常，一切皆是無常故」者，是喻方便惡立異法，由合喻顯非一切故。	以於此中立「聲為常，一切皆是無常故」者，是喻方便惡立異法，由合喻顯非一切故。	because in this case, establishing sound is permanent, because all are impermanent, is a bad establishment of the dissimilar example by means of the similar example, because it shows that it is not all.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a28_11']	此因非有，以聲攝在一切中故。	此因非有，以聲攝在一切中故。	This reason does not exist, because sound is included in all.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001a29_12']	或是所立一分義故，此義不成，名因過失。	或是所立一分義故，此義不成，名因過失。	Or because it is a part of the meaning to be established, this meaning is not established, and is called a fault of the reason.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b01_11']	喻亦有過，由異法喻先顯宗無，後說因無。	喻亦有過，由異法喻先顯宗無，後說因無。	The example also has a fault, because by the dissimilar example, the absence of the thesis is first shown, and then the absence of the reason is stated.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b01_16']	應如是言：	應如是言：	It should be said like this:
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b02_13']	「無常一切」是謂非「非一切」義故；	「無常一切」是謂非「非一切」義故；	Impermanent all is called the meaning of not not all;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b03_12']	然此倒說「一切無常」，是故此中喻亦有過。	然此倒說「一切無常」，是故此中喻亦有過。	However, this inverted statement that all are impermanent is therefore also faulty in this case.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b04_8']	如是已說宗及似宗。	如是已說宗及似宗。	Thus, the thesis and pseudo-thesis have been explained.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b05_8']	因與似因多是宗法，此差別相今當顯示：	因與似因多是宗法，此差別相今當顯示：	The reason and pseudo-reason are mostly the property of the thesis. The characteristics of their distinctions will now be revealed:
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b06_15']	宗法於同品，　　謂有、非有、俱；	宗法於同品，　　謂有、非有、俱；	The property of the thesis in the similar instance is said to be existent, non-existent, and both;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b07_14']	於異品各三，　　有、非有及二。	於異品各三，　　有、非有及二。	In the dissimilar instance, there are three each, existent, non-existent, and both.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b08_12']	豈不總以樂所成立合說為宗？	豈不總以樂所成立合說為宗？	Isn't it that the thesis is generally established by what is agreeable and explained together?
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b09_8']	云何此中乃言宗者唯取有法？	云何此中乃言宗者唯取有法？	How is it that in this case the thesis only takes the property possessor?
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b09_13']	此無有失。	此無有失。	This is not a mistake.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b10_11']	以其總聲於別亦轉，如言「燒衣」；	以其總聲於別亦轉，如言「燒衣」；	Because the general sound also applies to the individual, like saying burn the robe;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b10_20']	或有宗聲唯詮於法。	或有宗聲唯詮於法。	Or there is the sound of thesis that only expresses the property.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b11_17']	此中宗法，唯取立論及敵論者決定同許。	此中宗法，唯取立論及敵論者決定同許。	Here, the property of the thesis only takes what is definitely agreed upon by the proponent and the opponent.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b12_13']	於同品中，有、非有等亦復如是。	於同品中，有、非有等亦復如是。	In the similar instance, the existent, non-existent, and so on are also like this.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b12_17']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b14_6']	今此唯依證了因故，但由智力了所說義，非如生因由能起用。	今此唯依證了因故，但由智力了所說義，非如生因由能起用。	Now, this is only based on the cause of realization and understanding, so it is only by the power of knowledge that one understands the meaning of what is said, not like a generative cause that gives rise to function.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b15_6']	若爾，既取智為了因，是言便失能成立義。	若爾，既取智為了因，是言便失能成立義。	If that is so, since one takes knowledge as the cause of realization, then speech loses the meaning of being able to establish.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b17_2']	此亦不然，令彼憶念本極成故，是故此中唯取彼此俱定許義，即為善說。	此亦不然，令彼憶念本極成故，是故此中唯取彼此俱定許義，即為善說。	This is also not so, because it causes them to remember what was originally well-established. Therefore, in this case, only taking what is definitely accepted by both parties is considered to be a good explanation.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b18_15']	由是若有彼此不同許，定非宗法，如有成立「聲是無常，眼所見故」。	由是若有彼此不同許，定非宗法，如有成立「聲是無常，眼所見故」。	Thus, if there is something that is not accepted by both parties, it definitely cannot be a property of the thesis, like establishing sound is impermanent because it is seen by the eyes.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b19_15']	又若敵論不同許者，如對顯論「所作性故」。	又若敵論不同許者，如對顯論「所作性故」。	Moreover, if the opponent does not accept it, like in the case of the Vaibhāṣika, because of being produced.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b21_5']	又若猶豫，如依烟等起疑惑時，成立「大種和合火有，以現烟故」。	又若猶豫，如依烟等起疑惑時，成立「大種和合火有，以現烟故」。	Moreover, if there is doubt, like when giving rise to doubt based on smoke, establishing there is fire in the combination of the primary elements, because smoke is present.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b22_16']	或於是處有法不成，如成立「我其體周遍，於一切處生樂等故」。	或於是處有法不成，如成立「我其體周遍，於一切處生樂等故」。	Or, if the property of the subject is not established in this case, like establishing the self is all-pervading, because pleasure and so forth arise everywhere.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b23_14']	如是所說一切品類所有言詞，皆非能立。	如是所說一切品類所有言詞，皆非能立。	All such statements, regardless of their type, are not valid forms of proof.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b24_14']	於其同品有、非有等，亦隨所應當如是說。	於其同品有、非有等，亦隨所應當如是說。	The same should be said about the presence or absence of similar instances, as appropriate.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b26_8']	於當所說因與相違及不定中，唯有共許決定言詞說名能立、或名能破。	於當所說因與相違及不定中，唯有共許決定言詞說名能立、或名能破。	In the following proofs, only statements that are mutually agreed upon and definite can be called valid forms of proof or refutation.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b27_3']	非互不成猶豫言詞，復待成故。	非互不成猶豫言詞，復待成故。	Ambiguous statements that are not mutually established require further proof.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b28_3']	夫立宗法，理應更以餘法為因成立此法：	夫立宗法，理應更以餘法為因成立此法：	When establishing a thesis, one should further use other principles as reasons to prove it.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001b29_18']	若即成立有法為有、或立為無，如有成立「最勝為有，現見別物有總類故」；	若即成立有法為有、或立為無，如有成立「最勝為有，現見別物有總類故」；	If one directly proves the existence of a dharma or its non-existence, like proving that the supreme is existent because it is seen to have a general category like other things;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c01_11']	或立為「無，不可得故」。	或立為「無，不可得故」。	or proving that it is non-existent because it cannot be apprehended.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c01_16']	其義云何？	其義云何？	What does this mean?
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c02_20']	此中但立「別物定有一因為宗」，不立「最勝」，故無此失。	此中但立「別物定有一因為宗」，不立「最勝」，故無此失。	Here, only the thesis that other things definitely have one cause is established, not the supreme, so there is no fault.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c04_3']	若立為「無」，亦假安立「不可得法」，是故亦無有有法過。	若立為「無」，亦假安立「不可得法」，是故亦無有有法過。	If one establishes it as non-existent, one also provisionally establishes the dharma of non-attainment. Therefore, there is also no error of the existence of a dharma.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c05_15']	若以有法立餘有法、或立其法，如以烟立火，或以火立觸，其義云何？	若以有法立餘有法、或立其法，如以烟立火，或以火立觸，其義云何？	If one uses an existent dharma to establish another existent dharma, or to establish its dharma, like using smoke to establish fire, or using fire to establish contact, what is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c07_2']	今於此中非以成立「火」「觸」為宗，但為成立此相應物。	今於此中非以成立「火」「觸」為宗，但為成立此相應物。	In this case, it is not to establish fire and contact as the thesis, but only to establish this corresponding object.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c08_7']	若不爾者，依烟立火、依火立觸，應成宗義一分為因。	若不爾者，依烟立火、依火立觸，應成宗義一分為因。	If it were not so, then using smoke to establish fire and using fire to establish contact would constitute using part of the thesis as the reason.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c09_10']	又於此中非欲成立火、觸有性，共知有故。	又於此中非欲成立火、觸有性，共知有故。	Moreover, in this case, it is not to establish that fire and contact have nature, because it is commonly known that they exist.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c10_16']	又於此中觀所成故立法、有法，非德、有德，故無有過。	又於此中觀所成故立法、有法，非德、有德，故無有過。	Moreover, in this case, the establishment of dharma and existence is based on observation, not on virtue and existence. Therefore, there is no error.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c10_21']	重說頌言：	重說頌言：	Again, a verse is spoken:
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c11_18']	有法非成於有法、　　及法，此非成有法；	有法非成於有法、　　及法，此非成有法；	Existence is not established in existence, nor is dharma established in existence;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c12_17']	但由法故成其法，　　如是成立於有法。	但由法故成其法，　　如是成立於有法。	But only by the dharma does it become its dharma, in this way it is established in the existent dharma.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c14_12']	若有成立「聲非是常，業等應常故、常應可得故」，如是云何名為宗法？	若有成立「聲非是常，業等應常故、常應可得故」，如是云何名為宗法？	If there is an establishment that sound is not permanent, because of the permanence of action, etc., and because of the attainability of permanence, how is this called the property of the thesis?
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c16_15']	此說彼過由宗、因門，以有所立，說「應」言故、以先立「常，無形礙故」，後但立宗，斥彼因過。	此說彼過由宗、因門，以有所立，說「應」言故、以先立「常，無形礙故」，後但立宗，斥彼因過。	This is said to be an error by the method of thesis and reason, because there is something to be established, the word should is used, and because permanence is established first because of being formless and unobstructed, later only the thesis is established, and the error of the reason is refuted.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c18_1']	若如是立「聲是無常，所作非常故、常非所作故」，此復云何？	若如是立「聲是無常，所作非常故、常非所作故」，此復云何？	If it is established in this way that sound is impermanent, because of the impermanence of what is produced, and because of the non-production of what is permanent, what is this again?
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c18_6']	是喻方便。	是喻方便。	This is a method of analogy.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c19_13']	同法、異法如其次第宣說其因，宗定隨逐，及宗無處定無因故。	同法、異法如其次第宣說其因，宗定隨逐，及宗無處定無因故。	The similar and dissimilar [examples] are explained in order by the reason. The thesis is definitely followed, and where there is no thesis, there is definitely no reason.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c21_13']	以於此中由合顯示所作性因，如是此聲定是所作、非非所作，此所作性定是宗法。	以於此中由合顯示所作性因，如是此聲定是所作、非非所作，此所作性定是宗法。	Because in this case, by combining, the reason of the nature of what is produced is shown. In this way, this sound is definitely produced, not non-produced. This nature of what is produced is definitely the property of the thesis.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c21_18']	重說頌言：	重說頌言：	Again, a verse is spoken:
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c22_6']	說因，宗所隨；	說因，宗所隨；	The reason is what the thesis follows.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c22_15']	　　宗無，因不有。	　　宗無，因不有。	Without the thesis, the reason does not exist.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c23_13']	依第五顯喻，　　由合故知因。	依第五顯喻，　　由合故知因。	Relying on the fifth, the example, the reason is known through combination.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c26_4']	由此已釋反破方便，以所作性於無常見故、於常不見故，如是成立「聲非是常，應非作故」。	由此已釋反破方便，以所作性於無常見故、於常不見故，如是成立「聲非是常，應非作故」。	By this, the method of refutation is already explained, because the nature of being produced is seen in the impermanent, and it is not seen in the permanent. In this way, it is established that sound is not permanent, because it should not be produced.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c26_19']	是故順成、反破方便，非別解因。	是故順成、反破方便，非別解因。	Therefore, the method of affirmation and refutation is not a separate explanation of the reason.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c27_17']	如破數論，我已廣辯，故應且止廣諍傍論。	如破數論，我已廣辯，故應且止廣諍傍論。	As for refuting the Sāṃkhya, I have already extensively argued, therefore one should stop the extensive debate on the secondary matter.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c28_10']	如是宗法三種差別，謂：	如是宗法三種差別，謂：	Thus, there are three kinds of distinctions in the property of the thesis, namely:
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c28_19']	同品有、非有及俱。	同品有、非有及俱。	Presence in the similar instance, absence in the dissimilar instance, and both.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0001c29_5']	先除「及」字。	先除「及」字。	First, remove the word and.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0002a01_11']	此中若品與所立法隣近均等，說名同品，以一切義皆名品故。	此中若品與所立法隣近均等，說名同品，以一切義皆名品故。	Here, if a class is proximate and equal to the property to be established, it is called the similar instance, because all meanings are called classes.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0002a02_11']	若所立無，說名異品，非與同品相違或異。	若所立無，說名異品，非與同品相違或異。	If the established is absent, it is called the dissimilar instance, not contradicting or different from the similar instance.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0002a03_2']	若相違者，應唯簡別；	若相違者，應唯簡別；	If they were contradictory, then it would only be a distinction;
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0002a03_12']	若別異者，應無有因。	若別異者，應無有因。	if they were different, then there would be no cause.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0002a04_20']	由此道理，「所作性故」能成「無常」及「無我」等，不相違故。	由此道理，「所作性故」能成「無常」及「無我」等，不相違故。	By this principle, because of being a product can establish impermanence and non-self and so on, because they are not contradictory.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0002a05_15']	若法能成相違所立，是相違過，即名似因。	若法能成相違所立，是相違過，即名似因。	If a dharma can establish a contradiction, it is a contradictory fault, and is called a pseudo-reason.
['ZH_T32_1628_001:0002a06_6']	如無違法，相違亦爾：	如無違法，相違亦爾：	Like the dharma without contradiction, the contradiction is also like this:
