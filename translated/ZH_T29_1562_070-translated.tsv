['ZH_T29_1562_070:0720c28_1']	14 十四辯賢聖品第六之十四復以何緣，諸阿羅漢等離有頂染同不受後生？	14 十四辯賢聖品第六之十四復以何緣，諸阿羅漢等離有頂染同不受後生？	Chapter 14: Distinguishing the Noble Ones, part 6, section 14. What is the reason that all arhats who have separated from the defilements of the peak of existence do not accept rebirth?
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0720c28_19']	然於其中有於煩惱證不生法，而非一切。	然於其中有於煩惱證不生法，而非一切。	However, among them, there are those who have realized the state of non-arising of the afflictions, but not all of them.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0720c29_8']	有說由根有差別故。	有說由根有差別故。	Some say it is because there are differences in faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a02_6']	此釋非理，以契經說退不退法根品同故，如說五根增上猛利極圓滿故名俱解脫。	此釋非理，以契經說退不退法根品同故，如說五根增上猛利極圓滿故名俱解脫。	This explanation is unreasonable, because the scriptures say that those with the nature of retrogression and non-retrogression are the same in terms of faculties. As it is said, because the five faculties are extremely superior, sharp, and perfect, they are called liberated by both parts.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a03_7']	然有俱解脫是退種性故，非根勝故證惑不生。	然有俱解脫是退種性故，非根勝故證惑不生。	However, there are those liberated by both parts who have the nature of retrogression, so it is not because of the superiority of faculties that the afflictions are not realized as non-arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a04_11']	若爾，由何種性別故，六種種性唯應果有，餘亦有耶？	若爾，由何種性別故，六種種性唯應果有，餘亦有耶？	If that is so, then why is it that the six types of nature are only found in the fruits of the saints, and not in others?
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a05_6']	修習練根唯無學位，餘位亦有。	修習練根唯無學位，餘位亦有。	The cultivation and training of faculties is only in the stage of post-learning, but it is also found in other stages.

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a08_19']	有學異生種性亦六，六種應果彼為先故，由所安住種性差別，故有斷惑後生不生。	有學異生種性亦六，六種應果彼為先故，由所安住種性差別，故有斷惑後生不生。	Learners and ordinary beings also have six types of dispositions, because the six types of results are preceded by them. Due to the distinction of the dispositions in which they abide, there is either subsequent birth or non-birth of the severing of afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a09_12']	定於何時於所斷惑證不生法？	定於何時於所斷惑證不生法？	At what time is the non-arising of the severed afflictions realized?
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a10_7']	謂得能止此類煩惱殊勝道時。	謂得能止此類煩惱殊勝道時。	It is said that when one attains the superior path that can stop this type of affliction,
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a11_3']	若爾，此不生應是擇滅，非非擇滅。	若爾，此不生應是擇滅，非非擇滅。	then this non-arising should be cessation through discrimination, not non-cessation through discrimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a12_7']	若是非擇滅，則非擇滅應是道果，如是便與聖教相違。	若是非擇滅，則非擇滅應是道果，如是便與聖教相違。	If it is non-cessation through discrimination, then non-cessation through discrimination should be the fruit of the path, and this would contradict the holy teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a12_10']	如說：	如說：	As it is said:
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a12_16']	云何非果法？	云何非果法？	What are non-fruit dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a13_4']	謂非擇滅及虛空。	謂非擇滅及虛空。	They are non-cessation through discrimination and space.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a14_12']	無此不生成擇滅失，以勝道轉非為此故，既非所為故非道果。	無此不生成擇滅失，以勝道轉非為此故，既非所為故非道果。	There is no error in making this non-arising into cessation through discrimination, because the superior path transforms, not for this [non-cessation through discrimination], and since it is not what is to be done, it is not the fruit of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a16_1']	謂勝道轉為證擇滅，非非擇滅，故道轉時所證不生不名道果。	謂勝道轉為證擇滅，非非擇滅，故道轉時所證不生不名道果。	That is, the superior path is turned into the realization of cessation through discrimination, not cessation not due to discrimination. Therefore, when the path is turned, the non-arising that is realized is not called the fruit of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a18_7']	如然燈者本為破闇非為盡油，而燈生時非唯破闇亦令油盡，然此油盡非本所為，是故不說名然燈果。	如然燈者本為破闇非為盡油，而燈生時非唯破闇亦令油盡，然此油盡非本所為，是故不說名然燈果。	It is like the case of lighting a lamp, which is originally done to dispel darkness, not to consume oil. When the lamp is lit, it not only dispels darkness but also consumes the oil. However, the consumption of the oil is not what was originally intended, so it is not called the fruit of lighting the lamp.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a18_17']	此亦應然，故無有失。	此亦應然，故無有失。	This should be the same, so there is no error.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a19_15']	故勝種性勝道生時亦證不生，然非道果。	故勝種性勝道生時亦證不生，然非道果。	Therefore, when the superior lineage and superior path arise, non-arising is also realized, but it is not the fruit of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a21_13']	今詳由道所證不生，定不由根，應皆得故，但由殊勝種性力得，故不動者惑必不生。	今詳由道所證不生，定不由根，應皆得故，但由殊勝種性力得，故不動者惑必不生。	Now, it is analyzed that the non-arising realized by the path is definitely not due to the faculties, because all should be able to attain it. It is only attained by the power of the superior lineage, so for the unshakable one, afflictions will definitely not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a23_2']	前說無學退法有三，一增進根、二退住學、三住自位而般涅槃。	前說無學退法有三，一增進根、二退住學、三住自位而般涅槃。	Previously it was said that there are three types of non-returners who regress to the state of learner: one who advances faculties, one who regresses and abides as a learner, and one who abides in their own stage and attains parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a25_11']	思等四隨應有四五六七，非唯無學有增進根，有學異生亦有此義，唯非見道能修練根，此位無容起加行故。	思等四隨應有四五六七，非唯無學有增進根，有學異生亦有此義，唯非見道能修練根，此位無容起加行故。	The four of thought and so on have four, five, six, and seven, respectively. Not only those beyond training can perfect their faculties. Those in training and ordinary beings also have this meaning. Only those in the path of insight can cultivate and perfect their faculties. In this state, they cannot give rise to added effort.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a27_9']	謂見道位速疾運轉，無暇於中更修餘事，唯於信解異生位中能修練根，如無學位。	謂見道位速疾運轉，無暇於中更修餘事，唯於信解異生位中能修練根，如無學位。	That is to say, the state of the path of insight quickly moves forward and does not have the leisure to cultivate other matters in it. Only in the state of faith and understanding and in the state of ordinary beings can one cultivate and perfect one’s faculties, as in the state beyond training.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721a28_9']	如說不動退現法樂，如何不動法亦許有退義？	如說不動退現法樂，如何不動法亦許有退義？	As it is said that the unshakable one does not regress and enjoys the present dharma, how is it that the unshakable one is also said to regress?

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b04_19']	二未得退，謂未能得應得功德；	二未得退，謂未能得應得功德；	The second is regression of what has not been obtained, which refers to not yet being able to obtain the merits that should be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b05_17']	三受用退，謂諸已得殊勝功德不現在前。	三受用退，謂諸已得殊勝功德不現在前。	The third is the degeneration of enjoyment, which is the non-manifestation of the superior qualities that have already been attained.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b06_16']	三中前二非得為體，第三唯彼不現在前。	三中前二非得為體，第三唯彼不現在前。	Among the three, the first two have non-acquisition as their substance, and the third is only their non-manifestation.

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b10_3']	除佛世尊，餘不動法具有未得及受用退。	除佛世尊，餘不動法具有未得及受用退。	Except for the World-Honored Buddha, the immovable Dharma has both the degeneration of what has not yet been attained and the degeneration of enjoyment.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b11_7']	謂於殊勝無諍定等應得功德未能得故，有未得退；	謂於殊勝無諍定等應得功德未能得故，有未得退；	This means that the superior qualities such as the attainment of the meditation of non-conflict have not yet been attained, so there is the degeneration of what has not yet been attained;
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b12_10']	有餘事業牽引其心，已得功德無暇起故，有受用退。	有餘事業牽引其心，已得功德無暇起故，有受用退。	there are other tasks that draw the mind, and there is no opportunity for the qualities that have already been attained to arise, so there is the degeneration of enjoyment.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b13_8']	餘五種性容具有三，亦容退失已得德故。	餘五種性容具有三，亦容退失已得德故。	The other five types of nature may all have the three, because they may also retrogress from the qualities that have already been attained.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b14_8']	約受用退，說不動法退現法樂，無相違過。	約受用退，說不動法退現法樂，無相違過。	In terms of the degeneration of enjoyment, it is said that the immovable Dharma retrogresses from the present enjoyment of the Dharma, but there is no contradiction.

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b19_2']	然於靜慮起自在中可有退者名為退法，不可退者名不退法。	然於靜慮起自在中可有退者名為退法，不可退者名不退法。	However, there are those who regress in the mastery of the trance states and are called those who regress, and those who do not regress are called those who do not regress.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b19_12']	如是思等，如理應思。	如是思等，如理應思。	The same is true of the other three types of perfected beings, such as those who contemplate.

The superior trance states produced by these two types of perfected beings do not regress even when they encounter conditions that cause regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721b24_5']	安住法者但於已住諸勝德中能無退失，不能更引餘勝德生。	安住法者但於已住諸勝德中能無退失，不能更引餘勝德生。	Those who are steadfast only do not lose the superior virtues they have already attained, but they are unable to induce the arising of other superior virtues.

This is the difference between the three kinds of arhats, those who do not fall away, etc. But this classification of arhats as falling away, etc., is not established.

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c03_5']	雖言安住新起勝德可有退理異於不退，而安住名不依彼立，安住名顯離進退故。	雖言安住新起勝德可有退理異於不退，而安住名不依彼立，安住名顯離進退故。	Even though it is said that those who are steadfast generate new superior qualities and can fall away from them, this is different from those who do not fall away, still, the name steadfast is not established on the basis of this, because the name steadfast is a designation for one who is free from falling away and progress.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c04_4']	又彼宗許安住利根，寧言有退新起勝德？	又彼宗許安住利根，寧言有退新起勝德？	Moreover, your school admits that those who are steadfast are of keen faculties. How can you say that they fall away and generate new superior qualities?
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c04_14']	若許有退，應名退法。	若許有退，應名退法。	If you admit that they fall away, they should be called those who fall away.

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c07_18']	所言不動由練根得，異不退法，理亦不成，以彼所宗於現法樂怖失自在故修練根，練所得根為退不退？	所言不動由練根得，異不退法，理亦不成，以彼所宗於現法樂怖失自在故修練根，練所得根為退不退？	The explanation that those who are unshakable are obtained through the exercise of faculties is also unreasonable, because according to their system, one exercises ones faculties in order to fearlessly enjoy the bliss of samādhi in this life. Are the faculties obtained through exercise liable to retrogress or not?
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c09_7']	若許有退應名退法，以彼自說若於靜慮退失自在名退法故。	若許有退應名退法，以彼自說若於靜慮退失自在名退法故。	If you admit that they retrogress, they should be called those who retrogress, because they themselves say that those who retrogress from mastery of samādhi are called those who retrogress.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c10_15']	若許不退，如由退力立退法名，如是亦應由不退力名為不退。	若許不退，如由退力立退法名，如是亦應由不退力名為不退。	If you admit that they do not retrogress, then just as one is called one who retrogresses because of the power of retrogressing, so one would be called one who does not retrogress because of the power of not retrogressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c11_14']	是則不動與不退同，如何於中固立差別？	是則不動與不退同，如何於中固立差別？	In that case, the unshakable would be the same as those who do not retrogress, so how can you insist on establishing a difference between them?

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c14_20']	是則應同安住堪達，彼許安住本性利根，非練根得，同無退故。	是則應同安住堪達，彼許安住本性利根，非練根得，同無退故。	Then they would be the same as those who are steadfast and capable of penetrating insight, because they admit that those who are steadfast are by nature sharp faculties, not faculties attained through practice, because they are the same in not retrogressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c16_16']	雖言不退能新引起殊勝功德與安住異，理亦不然，不約新起殊勝功德立不退故。	雖言不退能新引起殊勝功德與安住異，理亦不然，不約新起殊勝功德立不退故。	Even though it is said that they do not retrogress and are able to newly arouse superior merits that are different from those of the steadfast, this is not reasonable, because nonretrogressing is not established on the basis of newly aroused superior merits.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c18_14']	謂彼所宗言此種性於新勝德若起不起，性利根故，於現法樂不失自在是不退相。	謂彼所宗言此種性於新勝德若起不起，性利根故，於現法樂不失自在是不退相。	That is, according to their doctrines, whether or not this nature newly arouses superior merits, it is sharp by nature, and it does not lose mastery over the bliss of the present state of existence. This is the characteristic of nonretrogressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c19_4']	安住亦然，故應無別。	安住亦然，故應無別。	The steadfast are also like this, and therefore there should be no difference.

Their doctrines do not say that from this nature one goes to another class of pure liberation. It must be admitted that they are able to practice the cultivation of the impure faculties. They are definitely based on the former nature of retrogressing. The practice of cultivating the faculties is called capable of penetrating insight. This means that the capable of penetrating insight also perfects the faculties through cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0721c22_19']	此所成根為退不退？	此所成根為退不退？	Are the perfected faculties subject to retrogressing or not?

However, he is able to see the end of the contaminants with wisdom. The World Honored One says that he is liberated by wisdom.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0725b16_9']	由此彼謂《蘇尸摩經》且據圓滿慧解脫說，唯約已得滅盡定者立俱解脫，其理不成。	由此彼謂《蘇尸摩經》且據圓滿慧解脫說，唯約已得滅盡定者立俱解脫，其理不成。	Because of this, they say that the Sūtra on Subhūti is about the perfected liberated by wisdom, and that only those who have attained the absorption of cessation are called liberated in both ways. Their reasoning is not established.

Only those who are able to produce the fundamental meditative absorptions in the present are called endowed with the three clear knowledges.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0725b19_14']	有俱解脫非具三明，謂阿羅漢得八解脫，而未能起三明現前。	有俱解脫非具三明，謂阿羅漢得八解脫，而未能起三明現前。	There are those who are liberated in both ways but not endowed with the three clear knowledges.

['ZH_T29_1562_070:0725b21_11']	今詳諸經真實意趣，慧俱解脫若圓滿者其體各異，未起根本已得滅盡位懸隔故。	今詳諸經真實意趣，慧俱解脫若圓滿者其體各異，未起根本已得滅盡位懸隔故。	Now, examining the true meaning of the scriptures, if the one liberated by both parts is complete, its substance is each different, because the stage of having already attained cessation is far removed from the stage of not yet producing the fundamental [attainments].
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0725b22_12']	不圓滿者二體相雜，隨說皆通，不應為諍。	不圓滿者二體相雜，隨說皆通，不應為諍。	If it is incomplete, the two substances are mixed together. Either explanation is acceptable. There should be no dispute.

Although the fundamental meditative absorptions are not presently active, one necessarily perfects them in the past and future.
['ZH_T29_1562_070:0725b25_17']	由此可說具三明者，理通攝在二解脫中。	由此可說具三明者，理通攝在二解脫中。	Based on this, one can say that one who possesses the three kinds of clear knowledge is generally included in the two kinds of liberation.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
