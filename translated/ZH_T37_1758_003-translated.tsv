The power of good karma is weak, and the life-force gradually becomes shorter, due to the karma of killing.
['ZH_T37_1758_003:0346b28_12']	若諸眾生不識父母、不識沙門及宗族尊長，不修義理、不怖不畏今世後世惡業果報，不修惠施不作功德、不修齊法不持禁戒，是名有情濁。	若諸眾生不識父母、不識沙門及宗族尊長，不修義理、不怖不畏今世後世惡業果報，不修惠施不作功德、不修齊法不持禁戒，是名有情濁。	003	If sentient beings do not recognize their parents, do not recognize śramaṇas or their venerable elders, do not cultivate meaning and principle, are not afraid or fearful of the results of evil karma in this world and the next, do not practice charity or create merit, do not cultivate proper principles or uphold precepts, this is called the impurity of sentient beings.

It is combined with the eighth consciousness and the five aggregates as its nature.

This is not the greed for non-dharma, the sword of wisdom, etc. that causes killing, or the stinginess that only abandons the sword for the sake of wealth. The disputes arising from the cause of greed for non-dharma, etc. ultimately arise, and all the other evil and unwholesome dharmas completely include all the afflictions and secondary afflictions. Due to the nature of frequent practice, when encountering evil circumstances, the afflictions are even heavier.

When afflictions increase and evil karma becomes even heavier, then one invites evil consequences and the three calamities arise.
