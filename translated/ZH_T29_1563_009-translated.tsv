Because one's own substance should not depend on one's own substance, and also because one should not depend on the substance of the same category.

Mind also uses them as a simultaneous cause, that is, just as derivative form is not the result of birth, etc., and birth, etc., are not not simultaneous causes of the primary elements, so it is in this case.

['ZH_T29_1563_009:0815b09_16']	豈不但言一生住滅，即知亦是墮一世中。	豈不但言一生住滅，即知亦是墮一世中。	Why not simply say that they arise, endure, and are destroyed, and that they fall into one time period?

In order to refute the view that only the effect of human action arises simultaneously with the cause, because in the aggregate that arises simultaneously with the cause, they are mutually effects.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0815b20_15']	自非自體士用果故，即顯非彼俱起和合。	自非自體士用果故，即顯非彼俱起和合。	Because the self is not the effect of human action of its own self, it is shown that it is not the effect of human action in the simultaneous aggregate.

['ZH_T29_1563_009:0818c16_10']	雖有此誦，於義無失，謂諸世間於設功用所欣事辦共立果名。	雖有此誦，於義無失，謂諸世間於設功用所欣事辦共立果名。	Even though there is this recitation, there is no error in meaning, because in the world, when one has accomplished what he has striven for through exertion, people commonly call it a result.

['ZH_T29_1563_009:0818c19_7']	言無因者，道於所得擇滅無為非六因故。	言無因者，道於所得擇滅無為非六因故。	It is said that it has no cause, because the path is not the six causes in regard to the cessation that is realized.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0818c21_14']	擇滅於道非所生果是所證果，道於擇滅非能生因是能證因，故道與滅更互相對，因果是非不可定執。	擇滅於道非所生果是所證果，道於擇滅非能生因是能證因，故道與滅更互相對，因果是非不可定執。	Cessation is not a fruit produced by the path, but a fruit realized by the path, and the path is not a cause that produces cessation, but a cause that realizes cessation. Therefore, the path and cessation are mutually related as cause and effect, but it cannot be definitely asserted that the relationship is that of producing cause and produced effect.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0818c23_3']	若道於滅為證得因，是則但應得為道果，誰言道果定非滅得？	若道於滅為證得因，是則但應得為道果，誰言道果定非滅得？	If the path is the cause that realizes cessation, then it should only be the fruit of the path. Who says that the fruit of the path is definitely not the acquisition of cessation?

['ZH_T29_1563_009:0818c26_2']	然此非聖正所求果，聖不求有為而修聖道故，道於滅得為能生因，道於滅體為能證因。	然此非聖正所求果，聖不求有為而修聖道故，道於滅得為能生因，道於滅體為能證因。	However, this is not the holy fruit that is truly sought, because the holy ones do not seek conditioned dharmas but cultivate the holy path. Therefore, the path is the productive cause of the acquisition of cessation, and the path is the realizing cause of the essence of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0818c27_1']	既許無為是能作因，應許無為有增上果。	既許無為是能作因，應許無為有增上果。	Since you admit that unconditioned dharmas are efficient causes, you must admit that unconditioned dharmas have dominant fruits.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0819a01_2']	以不障故立能作因，非能生故無增上果，由如是理，如有為法建立因果，無為不然，是故擇滅是因無果、是果無因，餘二無為是因非果。	以不障故立能作因，非能生故無增上果，由如是理，如有為法建立因果，無為不然，是故擇滅是因無果、是果無因，餘二無為是因非果。	Because it does not obstruct, it is established as the efficient cause. Because it is not a productive cause, it does not have a dominant result. For this reason, conditioned dharmas establish causes and effects, but unconditioned dharmas do not. Therefore, cessation through discrimination is a cause but not a result, and it is a result but not a cause. The remaining two unconditioned dharmas are both causes and results.

['ZH_T29_1563_009:0819a09_17']	異熟從異熟生，故此不應名無異熟。	異熟從異熟生，故此不應名無異熟。	Karmic retribution arises from karmic retribution, so it should not be called non-karmic retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0819a12_4']	彼言非理，同類、異熟二因所生義各別故，謂前異熟為同類因，生後異熟為等流果，即後異熟由先業成。	彼言非理，同類、異熟二因所生義各別故，謂前異熟為同類因，生後異熟為等流果，即後異熟由先業成。	This is unreasonable, because the two causes of similar and karmic retribution produce different meanings. That is to say, the previous karmic retribution becomes the cause of similar type, and the subsequent karmic retribution is born as the result of the same outflow. The subsequent karmic retribution is accomplished by previous karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0819a13_3']	能成諸業名異熟因，所成異熟即異熟果。	能成諸業名異熟因，所成異熟即異熟果。	The karma that accomplishes it is called the cause of karmic retribution, and the accomplished karmic retribution is the result of karmic retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0819a14_2']	二因體異，二果義分，因果類殊無相雜過。	二因體異，二果義分，因果類殊無相雜過。	The natures of the two causes are different, and the meanings of the two results are distinct. There is no error of confusion between the causes and results of different types.
['ZH_T29_1563_009:0819a15_19']	然異熟體如熟飲食，於生異熟無勝功能，故唯不善及善有漏，是異熟因名有異熟。	然異熟體如熟飲食，於生異熟無勝功能，故唯不善及善有漏，是異熟因名有異熟。	However, the nature of karmic retribution is like cooked food and drink. It has no superior function in producing karmic retribution. Therefore, only the unwholesome and the wholesome contaminated are the causes of karmic retribution and are called having karmic retribution.

['ZH_T29_1563_009:0819a18_6']	增上之果名增上果，唯無障住有何增上？	增上之果名增上果，唯無障住有何增上？	The result of dominance is called the dominant result. What is the dominant fruit of mere non-obstruction?
