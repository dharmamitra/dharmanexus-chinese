In the previous treatise verse, it briefly raises the question and answer, saying In this Dharma realm, it is neither one nor different.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0867c27_7']	此明碎三千世界極細微塵，為無色香味觸之塵，然今窓中因日光見者此是麁塵，析此為三百分方謂微塵，此微塵非凡夫二乘所見。	此明碎三千世界極細微塵，為無色香味觸之塵，然今窓中因日光見者此是麁塵，析此為三百分方謂微塵，此微塵非凡夫二乘所見。	010	This clarifies that the extremely fine dust particles of the shattered trichiliocosm are dust particles without form, smell, taste, or touch. However, what is seen through the window due to sunlight now are coarse dust particles. Analyzing these into three hundred parts is called fine dust. This fine dust is not seen by ordinary beings or the two vehicles.

Although the number is large, it cannot be said to abide in one place, in a different place, or to be combined into one, in order to illustrate that the three Buddhas and the Buddhas of the ten directions are also numerous and immeasurable.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a03_16']	然此諸佛雖多，斷煩惱盡時，於真如法界中，不可說言一異，亦不可說言一處住、異處住。	然此諸佛雖多，斷煩惱盡時，於真如法界中，不可說言一異，亦不可說言一處住、異處住。	010	Moreover, although these Buddhas are numerous, when they have exhausted the afflictions, in the Dharma realm of suchness, it cannot be said that they are one or different, nor can it be said that they abide in one place or in different places.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a05_12']	眾生佛性性淨解脫，據眾生雖多，而真如理中古今平等，亦不可說言一異多少。	眾生佛性性淨解脫，據眾生雖多，而真如理中古今平等，亦不可說言一異多少。	010	The Buddha-nature of sentient beings is the pure liberation of their nature. Although sentient beings are numerous, the principle of suchness is the same throughout past and present. It cannot be said to be one, different, many, or few.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a06_2']	為釋此疑，故次明也。	為釋此疑，故次明也。	010	In order to resolve this doubt, the following is explained.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a08_2']	「以三千世界微塵」者，此舉三千世界極細微塵也。	「以三千世界微塵」者，此舉三千世界極細微塵也。	010	With the dust motes of the trichiliocosm refers to the most minute dust motes of the trichiliocosm.

The character jie means nature, so this single dust mote is discussed in terms of the world and is also called a world and also called a dust mote.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a11_10']	「碎為微塵」者，復碎此極細微塵為無色香味觸微塵也。	「碎為微塵」者，復碎此極細微塵為無色香味觸微塵也。	010	Crushing them into dust motes means further crushing those most minute dust motes into dust motes without form, taste, smell, or touch.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a13_2']	「阿僧祇」者，明非但碎三千世界為微塵，亦碎阿僧祇世界以為微塵。	「阿僧祇」者，明非但碎三千世界為微塵，亦碎阿僧祇世界以為微塵。	010	Asankhyeya means not only crushing the trichiliocosm into dust motes, but also crushing asankhyeya worlds into dust motes.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a14_3']	亦得言無色味微塵不可算數故，言阿僧祇也。	亦得言無色味微塵不可算數故，言阿僧祇也。	010	It can also be said that the dust motes without form and taste are incalculable, so it is said to be asankhyeya.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a18_10']	」此明如來向者所說彼塵眾多；	」此明如來向者所說彼塵眾多；	010	This clarifies that the Tathāgata just now said that mass of dust is much;
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a20_18']	雖多，以無色香味觸形狀方所、無妨無礙故，不可說一處住、異處住、合作一，以喻十方諸佛亦甚多無量。	雖多，以無色香味觸形狀方所、無妨無礙故，不可說一處住、異處住、合作一，以喻十方諸佛亦甚多無量。	010	although much, it has no color, smell, taste, touch, shape, or location, and is unobstructed, so it cannot be said to abide in one place or in different places, combined into one, using it as a metaphor for the Buddhas of the ten directions who are also very numerous and immeasurable.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a21_19']	此十方諸佛，若據行者而言，一行者自作一佛；	此十方諸佛，若據行者而言，一行者自作一佛；	010	These Buddhas of the ten directions, if based on practitioners, then one practitioner creates one Buddha;
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a22_10']	行者既多，故佛亦多也。	行者既多，故佛亦多也。	010	since there are many practitioners, there are also many Buddhas.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a23_3']	諸佛據行者既多，不可說一；	諸佛據行者既多，不可說一；	010	Since the Buddhas based on practitioners are numerous, they cannot be said to be one;
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a24_2']	二障永盡，法身平等無有差別，不可說異。	二障永盡，法身平等無有差別，不可說異。	010	The two hindrances are eternally extinguished, and the Dharma body is equal and without distinction, and cannot be said to be different.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a28_1']	然此微塵碎為無色味之塵雖多，無有形狀故，無色味等，亦無六方故，不可說一處，喻十方諸佛斷除二鄣會真如法界時，無有形礙，亦無方所故，不可說言一處住、異處住也。	然此微塵碎為無色味之塵雖多，無有形狀故，無色味等，亦無六方故，不可說一處，喻十方諸佛斷除二鄣會真如法界時，無有形礙，亦無方所故，不可說言一處住、異處住也。	010	However, although these dust motes are shattered into formless, tasteless dust, they are numerous, but because they have no shape or appearance, they also have no color, taste, etc., and also have no six directions, so they cannot be said to be in one place. The analogy is that when the buddhas of the ten directions eliminate the two hindrances and unite with the Dharma realm of suchness, there is no obstruction of form and also no location, so it cannot be said that they abide in one place or abide in different places.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a28_14']	須菩提解佛意故，仰答如上。	須菩提解佛意故，仰答如上。	010	Subhūti understood the Buddha's intention and thus responded as above.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868a29_3']	眾中有人因生疑念：	眾中有人因生疑念：	010	There were people in the assembly who gave rise to doubts:
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b01_9']	前既言碎微塵作虛空，無有六方形狀，復云微塵眾甚多。	前既言碎微塵作虛空，無有六方形狀，復云微塵眾甚多。	010	Previously, it was said that the dust motes are shattered to form space, which has no six directions or shape, and it is also said that the multitude of dust motes is extremely numerous.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b01_17']	此二言何故相違？	此二言何故相違？	010	Why are these two statements contradictory?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b02_6']	故言「何以故」也。	故言「何以故」也。	010	Thus, it says why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b05_9']	即答「若是微塵眾實有者，佛則不說微塵眾」，此明若使微塵眾實有六方形狀色香味觸不空者，佛則不假設說碎細微塵以為無色味微塵也。	即答「若是微塵眾實有者，佛則不說微塵眾」，此明若使微塵眾實有六方形狀色香味觸不空者，佛則不假設說碎細微塵以為無色味微塵也。	010	He immediately replied, If this multitude of dust particles were truly existent, the Buddha would not speak of a multitude of dust particles. This clarifies that if the multitude of dust particles were truly existent with the six characteristics of form, appearance, color, smell, taste, and touch, and were not empty, then the Buddha would not provisionally speak of the subtle dust particles that are broken down into formless and flavorless dust particles.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b05_13']	復疑云：	復疑云：	010	He further doubts,
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b06_17']	若此微塵體空無色味是不實者，何故如來說為微塵？	若此微塵體空無色味是不實者，何故如來說為微塵？	010	If these dust particles are empty in essence, formless and flavorless, and not real, why does the Thus-Come One speak of them as dust particles?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b08_5']	以如來說為微塵故，明知微塵是實不空，故言「何以故」。	以如來說為微塵故，明知微塵是實不空，故言「何以故」。	010	Because the Thus-Come One speaks of them as dust particles, it is clear that the dust particles are real and not empty. Therefore, he says, Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b10_3']	即答「佛說微塵眾則非微塵眾」，此明如來依世諦道中說虛妄微塵故，言佛說微塵眾也。	即答「佛說微塵眾則非微塵眾」，此明如來依世諦道中說虛妄微塵故，言佛說微塵眾也。	010	He immediately replies, The Buddha speaks of a multitude of dust particles, but it is not a multitude of dust particles. This clarifies that the Thus-Come One, based on the worldly truth, speaks of false dust particles, and therefore says the Buddha speaks of a multitude of dust particles.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b11_8']	此微塵眾虛妄不實，本來空寂，故言「則非微塵眾」。	此微塵眾虛妄不實，本來空寂，故言「則非微塵眾」。	010	This multitude of dust particles is false and unreal, originally empty and quiescent, and therefore says it is not a multitude of dust particles.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b12_5']	此之微塵既是虛妄，寧有實塵而可說也？	此之微塵既是虛妄，寧有實塵而可說也？	010	Since these subtle particles are false, how can there be any real particles to speak of?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b14_4']	「是故佛說微塵眾」者，以是故，如來上說無色香味觸無形狀之塵故，說於無塵為塵也。	「是故佛說微塵眾」者，以是故，如來上說無色香味觸無形狀之塵故，說於無塵為塵也。	010	Therefore, the Buddha speaks of the multitude of subtle particles - for this reason, the Tathāgata previously spoke of the lack of form and characteristics of the particles of color, smell, taste, and touch, and thus speaks of the lack of particles as particles.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b15_11']	亦得道是故佛說非微塵眾，此因事無，以明因緣法體空也。	亦得道是故佛說非微塵眾，此因事無，以明因緣法體空也。	010	It is also because of this that the Buddha speaks of the non-multitude of subtle particles. This matter of cause and effect being nonexistent clarifies the emptiness of the essence of dependent origination.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b16_3']	「世尊！	「世尊！	010	World-Honored One!
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b18_2']	如來說三千大千世界則非世界」者，向明微塵喻，據極細而言，此言三千世界，就塵為語。	如來說三千大千世界則非世界」者，向明微塵喻，據極細而言，此言三千世界，就塵為語。	010	The Tathāgata speaks of the three-thousand great one-thousand worlds as not being worlds - previously, the subtle particles were clarified, speaking from the perspective of the utmost subtlety. Here, the three-thousand worlds are spoken of, speaking from the perspective of the particles.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b18_7']	然復有疑：	然復有疑：	010	However, there is still a doubt:
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b19_4']	上佛說細微塵，其體不實故，所以是無。	上佛說細微塵，其體不實故，所以是無。	010	Previously, the Buddha spoke of the subtle particles, whose essence is not real, and therefore they are nonexistent.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b20_16']	然要以細微塵成麁世界，若細微塵無實者，何故有此三千世界等麁物？	然要以細微塵成麁世界，若細微塵無實者，何故有此三千世界等麁物？	010	However, the coarse worlds are formed from the subtle particles. If the subtle particles are unreal, why are there these coarse things such as the three-thousand great one-thousand worlds and so forth?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b22_10']	然此麁世界既為細塵所成，若細塵無者，何故眼見三千世界等麁物是有？	然此麁世界既為細塵所成，若細塵無者，何故眼見三千世界等麁物是有？	010	However, since this coarse world is composed of subtle particles, if subtle particles did not exist, why would the eyes see that the coarse objects such as the three thousand worlds exist?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b23_5']	以麁物有故，明知細塵亦有也。	以麁物有故，明知細塵亦有也。	010	Since coarse objects exist, it is clear that subtle particles also exist.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b24_15']	故答「如來說三千大千世界則非世界」，明如來說假三千成一世界。	故答「如來說三千大千世界則非世界」，明如來說假三千成一世界。	010	Therefore, the answer states, The Tathāgata says the three thousand great one thousand worlds are not worlds. This clarifies that the Tathāgata speaks of the three thousand worlds as being a single world.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b25_12']	若有一世界不為他成，可有世界是實；	若有一世界不為他成，可有世界是實；	010	If there were a single world that was not formed by other things, then there would be a real world;
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b26_7']	然無一世界不為他成，是故無實。	然無一世界不為他成，是故無實。	010	however, there is not a single world that is not formed by other things, and therefore it is unreal.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b27_7']	以其無實故，言如來說三千世界則非世界也。	以其無實故，言如來說三千世界則非世界也。	010	Because it is unreal, it is said that the Tathāgata says the three thousand worlds are not worlds.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868b28_8']	然此細塵既無，明知三千麁界亦虛假不實也。	然此細塵既無，明知三千麁界亦虛假不實也。	010	Since these subtle particles do not exist, it is clear that the coarse worlds of the three thousand worlds are also false and unreal.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c01_5']	「是故佛說三千世界」者，欲明若有一世界是實非虛妄者，佛則不虛說言三千世界；	「是故佛說三千世界」者，欲明若有一世界是實非虛妄者，佛則不虛說言三千世界；	010	Therefore, the Buddha speaks of the three thousand worlds means that if there were a single world that was real and not false, then the Buddha would not speak falsely of the three thousand worlds;
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c02_4']	佛既說攬三千為一世界，故知虛假不實。	佛既說攬三千為一世界，故知虛假不實。	010	Since the Buddha has said that the three thousand worlds are grasped as one world, we know that they are false and unreal.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c03_13']	「何以故」者，有人乘生疑念：	「何以故」者，有人乘生疑念：	010	Why is it so? Some people give rise to doubts:
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c05_2']	若微塵、世界二俱不實者，如來何說微塵集故世界成、散故世界壞？	若微塵、世界二俱不實者，如來何說微塵集故世界成、散故世界壞？	010	If both the subtle dust particles and the worlds are unreal, why did the Tathagata say that the world is formed by the accumulation of subtle dust particles and destroyed when they disperse?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c06_2']	以此聖言誠驗，故知微塵是實，何故言空？	以此聖言誠驗，故知微塵是實，何故言空？	010	Since this holy teaching is a true verification, we know that the subtle dust particles are real. Why is it said to be empty?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c06_9']	故云何以故也。	故云何以故也。	010	Therefore, it says why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c08_9']	即答「若世界實有者，則是一合相」，此言「世界」者，名微塵為世界，明何故三千世界是不實。	即答「若世界實有者，則是一合相」，此言「世界」者，名微塵為世界，明何故三千世界是不實。	010	The answer is: If the world truly exists, then it is a single aggregate. Here, world refers to the subtle dust particles as the world. It clarifies why the three thousand worlds are unreal.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c10_7']	若微塵世界是實者，四方微塵來則冥然一合，作一世界不可分別，不應有三千之名。	若微塵世界是實者，四方微塵來則冥然一合，作一世界不可分別，不應有三千之名。	010	If the subtle dust particles and the world are real, then the subtle dust particles from the four directions would come and merge into one, forming a single world that cannot be distinguished, and there should not be the name of three thousand.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c11_10']	既有三千之名，故知能成微塵世界是虛妄不實也。	既有三千之名，故知能成微塵世界是虛妄不實也。	010	Since there is the name of three thousand, we know that the subtle dust particles and the world that form it are false and unreal.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c12_7']	以此微塵虛妄不實故，即體是空。	以此微塵虛妄不實故，即體是空。	010	Because these dust motes are false and unreal, their substance is emptiness.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c13_8']	空無形狀故，往來無障，乃至鐵圍山亦不相妨礙。	空無形狀故，往來無障，乃至鐵圍山亦不相妨礙。	010	Emptiness has no form or shape, so coming and going are unobstructed, and even the Iron Encircling Mountains do not obstruct each other.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c15_6']	故理而言之，東方微塵來無障無礙，西方乃至南北上下六方微塵來皆無障無礙。	故理而言之，東方微塵來無障無礙，西方乃至南北上下六方微塵來皆無障無礙。	010	Therefore, in principle, dust motes from the east come without obstruction or hindrance, and dust motes from the west, and even the six directions of north, south, above, and below, all come without obstruction or hindrance.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0868c17_2']	此微塵既不相障礙，亦無聚集之相，泯然空無有形狀，乃至須彌山亦不可見。	此微塵既不相障礙，亦無聚集之相，泯然空無有形狀，乃至須彌山亦不可見。	010	Since these dust motes do not obstruct each other, they also have no aggregated form. They are utterly empty and formless, and even Mount Sumeru cannot be seen.

The buddhas are also like this. Because afflictions are exhausted, they are neither the same nor different.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b03_13']	初偈云「世界作微塵」等一偈，釋經中「善男子善女人以下乃至阿僧祇世界」，若依世辨論中名此微塵為世界，非謂三千等世界也。	初偈云「世界作微塵」等一偈，釋經中「善男子善女人以下乃至阿僧祇世界」，若依世辨論中名此微塵為世界，非謂三千等世界也。	010	The first verse, The world is made into dust particles, and so forth, explains the passage in the sutra from Good men and good women up to innumerable worlds. If we rely on the explanations in the treatises, this dust particle is called a world, and it does not refer to the three thousand worlds and so forth.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b05_8']	此明破有色味微塵為無色味微塵，此微塵無色香味觸亦無方所故名微塵。	此明破有色味微塵為無色味微塵，此微塵無色香味觸亦無方所故名微塵。	010	This clarifies that the coarse dust particles with form and taste are broken down into the subtle dust particles without form and taste. These dust particles have no form, smell, taste, or touch, and also have no location, so they are called dust particles.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b07_9']	「此喻示彼義」者，明借此微塵喻，釋上疑問於是法界處不一亦不異義，故云示彼義也。	「此喻示彼義」者，明借此微塵喻，釋上疑問於是法界處不一亦不異義，故云示彼義也。	010	This analogy illustrates that meaning clarifies that borrowing this dust particle analogy explains the above question about the meaning of the Dharma realm being neither the same nor different, and therefore it says illustrates that meaning.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b09_19']	「微塵碎為末」者，重舉上喻碎於微塵為無色味塵，喻諸佛如來成道之時永無二障，故下句言「示現煩惱盡」也。	「微塵碎為末」者，重舉上喻碎於微塵為無色味塵，喻諸佛如來成道之時永無二障，故下句言「示現煩惱盡」也。	010	The fine dust is crushed to powder refers to the above analogy of crushing the fine dust to become formless and flavorless dust, which is analogous to the time when all Buddhas and Tathagatas attain enlightenment, they are forever free from the two hindrances, thus the next line says manifesting the exhaustion of afflictions.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b10_20']	「此明何義」者，問此一偈引喻之意，為明何義也。	「此明何義」者，問此一偈引喻之意，為明何義也。	010	What does this clarify? asks the meaning of citing this analogy in one verse, to clarify what meaning?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b12_12']	偈言「於是法界處，非一亦非異」者，論主引前偈論略答微塵喻所況事也。	偈言「於是法界處，非一亦非異」者，論主引前偈論略答微塵喻所況事也。	010	The verse says, In this Dharma realm, it is neither the same nor different. The author of the treatise briefly answers the matter illustrated by the analogy of fine dust.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b14_18']	「彼諸佛如來於真如法界中」等，還解所引偈，明諸佛雖多，於真如法界中非一處住亦非異處住也。	「彼諸佛如來於真如法界中」等，還解所引偈，明諸佛雖多，於真如法界中非一處住亦非異處住也。	010	Those Buddhas and Tathagatas in the true suchness Dharma realm... and so on, again explains the cited verse, clarifying that although the Buddhas are many, they do not abide in the same place in the true suchness Dharma realm, nor do they abide in different places.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b16_14']	「為示此義故說世界碎微塵喻」者，釋諸佛不一處、不異處住竟，提喻來結也。	「為示此義故說世界碎微塵喻」者，釋諸佛不一處、不異處住竟，提喻來結也。	010	In order to illustrate this meaning, the analogy of the world being crushed into fine dust is given. This explains that the Buddhas do not abide in the same place or in different places, and brings up the analogy to conclude.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b19_4']	「此喻示何義」者，問此微塵喻況諸佛於真如法界中非一處住異處住者，未知此喻有何相似，得以此喻示況也？	「此喻示何義」者，問此微塵喻況諸佛於真如法界中非一處住異處住者，未知此喻有何相似，得以此喻示況也？	010	What does this analogy illustrate? The question is asking about the analogy of the particles of dust, which illustrates that the buddhas do not abide in one place or in different places within the Dharma realm of suchness. It is not yet known what similarities this analogy has, and how it can be used to illustrate this.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b20_6']	即以下半偈答言「微塵碎為末，示現煩惱盡」故。	即以下半偈答言「微塵碎為末，示現煩惱盡」故。	010	The answer is given in the second half of the verse, which states: The breaking of the dust into particles illustrates the exhaustion of afflictions.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b20_20']	明若不碎世界，則有彼此之殊；	明若不碎世界，則有彼此之殊；	010	It clarifies that if the world is not broken, then there will be distinctions between this and that;
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b21_12']	既碎為微塵，使無此彼之𮥯。	既碎為微塵，使無此彼之𮥯。	010	once it is broken into particles of dust, it eliminates the distinction between this and that.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b22_17']	喻諸佛如來斷二障盡時，於真如法界中無彼此障礙。	喻諸佛如來斷二障盡時，於真如法界中無彼此障礙。	010	The analogy illustrates that when the buddhas and tathāgatas have eliminated the two hindrances, there are no hindrances of this and that within the Dharma realm of suchness.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b23_14']	一處異處有如此相似，故以況之也。	一處異處有如此相似，故以況之也。	010	There are such similarities between one place and different places, and therefore it is used as an illustration.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b26_2']	「此喻非聚集微塵眾」者，將作偈釋經故，先舉經中所明喻意，言微塵眾者，非實有微塵聚集名為眾也。	「此喻非聚集微塵眾」者，將作偈釋經故，先舉經中所明喻意，言微塵眾者，非實有微塵聚集名為眾也。	010	This analogy is not about a collection of particles of dust - in order to compose the verse to explain the sūtra, it first cites the meaning of the analogy that is explained in the sūtra. It says that the collection of particles of dust is not actually a collection of real particles of dust.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b27_10']	「示現非一喻」者，為示現諸佛甚多，假設以無色味塵為微塵眾也。	「示現非一喻」者，為示現諸佛甚多，假設以無色味塵為微塵眾也。	010	The non-one metaphor is to show that the buddhas are very numerous, and to use the formless flavor dust as the multitude of dust motes.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870b29_4']	第二偈，釋經中「於意云何是微塵眾寧為多不是故佛說一合相」一段經也。	第二偈，釋經中「於意云何是微塵眾寧為多不是故佛說一合相」一段經也。	010	The second verse explains the passage in the sūtra that goes: What do you think? Is this multitude of dust motes very many or not? Therefore the Buddha says the one combined appearance.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c01_5']	「非聚集」者，上經言「微塵眾甚多」，似如實有微塵。	「非聚集」者，上經言「微塵眾甚多」，似如實有微塵。	010	Not a collection means that the above sūtra says the multitude of dust motes is very many, as if there really were dust motes.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c02_18']	此明以無色味塵為塵，非是實有微塵聚集而言微塵眾多，故言非聚集也。	此明以無色味塵為塵，非是實有微塵聚集而言微塵眾多，故言非聚集也。	010	This clarifies that using the formless flavor dust as dust is not the real existence of a multitude of dust motes gathered together, and therefore it says not a collection.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c03_6']	「故集」者，疑云：	「故集」者，疑云：	010	Therefore a collection means the doubt:
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c04_1']	若無實微塵聚集，何故言微塵眾多？	若無實微塵聚集，何故言微塵眾多？	010	If there is no real multitude of dust motes gathered together, why is it said that the multitude of dust motes is many?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c06_3']	故答道言聚集者，依世諦名字假設，無集中說集，非謂實有微塵眾聚集而言多，故云故集也。	故答道言聚集者，依世諦名字假設，無集中說集，非謂實有微塵眾聚集而言多，故云故集也。	010	Therefore the answer says that the collection is based on the conventional name of the worldly truth, speaking of a collection in the midst of no collection, not referring to the multitude of dust motes gathered together as many, and therefore it says therefore a collection.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c07_8']	「非唯是一喻」者，若實無微塵聚集，何故假設言甚多也？	「非唯是一喻」者，若實無微塵聚集，何故假設言甚多也？	010	It is not only this one analogy means that if there are truly no accumulated subtle particles, why then speak of a great many?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c08_14']	明以微塵微既多，況十方諸佛亦是甚多，不可說一故也。	明以微塵微既多，況十方諸佛亦是甚多，不可說一故也。	010	It clarifies that since the subtle particles are already numerous, how much more so are the buddhas of the ten directions, who are also extremely numerous and indescribable as one.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c11_5']	微塵既是無體，不可說言定有微塵聚集，以喻如來斷煩惱盡體無障礙，不可說言一處集，故云非唯是一喻也。	微塵既是無體，不可說言定有微塵聚集，以喻如來斷煩惱盡體無障礙，不可說言一處集，故云非唯是一喻也。	010	Since the subtle particles are already without substance, one cannot say that there are definitely accumulated subtle particles, using this as an analogy for the Tathāgata's exhaustion of afflictions and the absence of obstructions in his essence, which cannot be said to be accumulated in one place, thus it says it is not only this one analogy.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c12_12']	「聚集處非彼」者，明微塵雖多，以體空故，聚集處無實塵可得。	「聚集處非彼」者，明微塵雖多，以體空故，聚集處無實塵可得。	010	The place of accumulation is not that clarifies that although there are many subtle particles, since their substance is empty, no real particles can be obtained in the place of accumulation.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c14_5']	一處無故，亦不從異處而來，以異處無實微塵可得故，云聚集處非彼也。	一處無故，亦不從異處而來，以異處無實微塵可得故，云聚集處非彼也。	010	Since there is none in one place, they also do not come from other places, because no real subtle particles can be obtained in other places, thus it says the place of accumulation is not that.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c16_2']	「非是差別喻」者，明如微塵無礙，一處聚集相不可得故，異處差別來相亦不可得；	「非是差別喻」者，明如微塵無礙，一處聚集相不可得故，異處差別來相亦不可得；	010	This is not a simile of distinction means that just as a particle is unobstructed, the characteristic of aggregation in one place cannot be obtained, and the characteristic of coming from a different place with distinctions also cannot be obtained;
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c17_12']	況諸佛亦然，清淨法身體既無礙，非一處住故，亦非條然異處差別。	況諸佛亦然，清淨法身體既無礙，非一處住故，亦非條然異處差別。	010	how much more so is it the case with the buddhas? The pure Dharma body, being unobstructed, does not abide in one place, and is also not distinct in different places.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c18_13']	如東方阿閦等亦不可得，故云非是差別喻也。	如東方阿閦等亦不可得，故云非是差別喻也。	010	Just as Akṣobhya in the east and so forth cannot be obtained, therefore it is said that this is not a simile of distinction.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c18_19']	「此義云何？	「此義云何？	010	What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c19_15']	如微塵至無聚集物故」，釋上半偈也。	如微塵至無聚集物故」，釋上半偈也。	010	Just as a particle, up to the absence of aggregated objects, explains the first half of the verse.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c20_16']	「亦非異處差別至以差別不住故」，釋下半偈也。	「亦非異處差別至以差別不住故」，釋下半偈也。	010	Also not distinct in different places, up to the absence of distinctions, explains the second half of the verse.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0870c22_6']	「如是諸佛如來至亦非異處住」，上解偈中喻意，此義釋合喻之意也。	「如是諸佛如來至亦非異處住」，上解偈中喻意，此義釋合喻之意也。	010	Thus, all buddhas and tathāgatas, up to not abiding in different places, above it explains the meaning of the simile in the verse, this meaning explains the meaning of the simile in the verse.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0871c29_1']	所以明此者，上云存二空之人有細障在心，故不名得道。	所以明此者，上云存二空之人有細障在心，故不名得道。	010	The reason for clarifying this is that above it says that those who maintain the two emptinesses have subtle hindrances in their minds, and therefore they are not called those who have attained the Way.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0871c29_17']	明見真如者皆遠離細障，名為得道。	明見真如者皆遠離細障，名為得道。	010	It is clarified that those who see suchness are all far removed from subtle hindrances, and are called those who have attained the Way.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a06_11']	「及三昧」者，離垢等無量三昧，釋經中「如是信」也。	「及三昧」者，離垢等無量三昧，釋經中「如是信」也。	010	And samādhi refers to immeasurable samādhis such as freedom from defilements, explaining believing thus in the sutra.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a06_20']	故云二智及三昧也。	故云二智及三昧也。	010	Therefore it says two kinds of wisdom and samādhi.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a08_10']	「如是得遠離」者，明具智慧、三昧二種功德之人，得理究竟，能離細障也。	「如是得遠離」者，明具智慧、三昧二種功德之人，得理究竟，能離細障也。	010	Thus attaining freedom clarifies that a person endowed with the two kinds of merits of wisdom and samādhi attains the ultimate truth and is able to leave behind subtle hindrances.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a09_6']	「化身示現福」者，前經中有人生疑：	「化身示現福」者，前經中有人生疑：	010	The merit of manifesting the transformation body - in the previous sutra, there were people who gave rise to doubts:
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a11_13']	化佛既不脩行斷惑、不證菩提，亦不說法，有生滅去來，非是實佛，供養之者，為有福德、為無福德也？	化佛既不脩行斷惑、不證菩提，亦不說法，有生滅去來，非是實佛，供養之者，為有福德、為無福德也？	010	Since the transformation Buddha does not cultivate practice to sever afflictions, does not realize enlightenment, and also does not expound the Dharma, has birth and death, coming and going, and is not the true Buddha, will those who make offerings to him have merit or not?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a12_14']	若得福德，與供養真佛，為有差降、為無差降？	若得福德，與供養真佛，為有差降、為無差降？	010	If they obtain merit, is it the same as making offerings to the true Buddha or is there a difference?

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a17_11']	以此應佛從真處來，與彼二佛有其一義，復不言我是化佛，故供養化佛所得功德與真佛不異。	以此應佛從真處來，與彼二佛有其一義，復不言我是化佛，故供養化佛所得功德與真佛不異。	010	Because this responding Buddha comes from the true abode, it has the same meaning as those two Buddhas, and it also does not say I am the transformation Buddha. Therefore, the merit obtained from making offerings to the transformation Buddha is no different from that of the true Buddha.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a18_13', 'ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a20_7']	示現有福，非無無盡之福，有無量無邊功德故。🔽經引七寶施福雖多，而不如供養化佛，亦不及受化佛所說經教得福多也。	示現有福，非無無盡之福，有無量無邊功德故。 經引七寶施福雖多，而不如供養化佛，亦不及受化佛所說經教得福多也。	010	It manifests merit, and is not without inexhaustible merit, because it has immeasurable and boundless merit.🔽Although the merit of giving the seven treasures is said to be great in the sutra, it is still not as good as making offerings to the transformation Buddha, and it is also not as good as receiving the merit obtained from the sutra taught by the transformation Buddha.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a22_6']	然經中但辨受持化佛所說經尚勝七寶布施之福，明知供養化佛亦勝七寶施福也。	然經中但辨受持化佛所說經尚勝七寶布施之福，明知供養化佛亦勝七寶施福也。	010	However, the sutra only distinguishes the merit of receiving and upholding the sutra taught by the transformation Buddha, which is superior to the merit of giving the seven treasures. It is clear that making offerings to the transformation Buddha is also superior to the merit of giving the seven treasures.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872a23_10']	此二句，釋經中「若有發菩提心者至無量阿僧祇」也。	此二句，釋經中「若有發菩提心者至無量阿僧祇」也。	010	These two lines explain the sutra's If there are those who give rise to the bodhi mind, up to immeasurable asaṃkhyeyas.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872c23_5']	答意雖通明外色等法，大意舉境明心空也。	答意雖通明外色等法，大意舉境明心空也。	010	Although the meaning generally clarifies external forms and so forth, the main idea is to illustrate the emptiness of the mind by means of the objects.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872c23_17']	「如星」者，喻內能見心。	「如星」者，喻內能見心。	010	Like stars is a metaphor for the internal mind that can see.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872c26_3']	所以內能見心喻之以星，外道凡夫多計日月星辰是常故實，亦計內心是常是實，是故就其情計以破之。	所以內能見心喻之以星，外道凡夫多計日月星辰是常故實，亦計內心是常是實，是故就其情計以破之。	010	The reason the internal mind that can see is compared to stars is because non-Buddhists and ordinary people often consider the sun, moon, and stars to be permanent and real, and also consider the internal mind to be permanent and real. Therefore, based on their conceptual attachments, it is refuted.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0872c28_3']	明日月星辰迭相形奪遷轉不定故，所以不實，心法亦然，少分相似故，喻之如天上星宿。	明日月星辰迭相形奪遷轉不定故，所以不實，心法亦然，少分相似故，喻之如天上星宿。	010	The sun, moon, and stars alternately eclipse each other and change without fixed regularity, therefore they are not real. Mental phenomena are also like this, slightly similar, therefore they are likened to stars in the sky.

Before the supramundane verifying cognition and pure holy understanding arise, the deluded mental phenomena have the function of grasping objects.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a03_17']	聖解既起，妄想心法殄滅無餘，以其不實故也。	聖解既起，妄想心法殄滅無餘，以其不實故也。	010	Once the holy understanding arises, the deluded mental phenomena are completely extinguished without remainder, because they are not real.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a06_18']	何以得知心心法是實？	何以得知心心法是實？	010	How can one know that the mind and mental phenomena are real?
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a08_1']	以其能見前境能取六塵故，是如實故，喻之如翳。	以其能見前境能取六塵故，是如實故，喻之如翳。	010	Because it can see the preceding realm and can grasp the six sense objects, it is as it is in reality, and is likened to an eye disease.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a09_12']	以小乘人取謂翳揵闥婆城等是虛妄不實，能見六識及所見六塵是實故。	以小乘人取謂翳揵闥婆城等是虛妄不實，能見六識及所見六塵是實故。	010	Because the adherents of the Lesser Vehicle take the eye disease, gandharva city, etc. to be false and unreal, and take the six consciousnesses that can see and the six sense objects that are seen to be real.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a10_12']	如來就其所解，引以喻之，破其所執也。	如來就其所解，引以喻之，破其所執也。	010	The Tathāgata, based on what they understand, uses this as a metaphor to refute what they cling to.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a11_14']	如人目上有翳，於虛空中妄見毛輪等色，以之為實。	如人目上有翳，於虛空中妄見毛輪等色，以之為實。	010	It is like a person whose eyes are diseased, who falsely sees the colors of hair wheels, etc. in empty space, taking them to be real.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a13_10']	觀有為法心亦復如是，於色等有為虛妄法中，謂不實為實，以心倒取境故也。	觀有為法心亦復如是，於色等有為虛妄法中，謂不實為實，以心倒取境故也。	010	The mind that observes conditioned phenomena is also like this. Within the false and unreal conditioned phenomena such as form, etc., it takes what is unreal to be real, because the mind mistakenly grasps the objects.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873a17_17']	如世人燃燈，要以清油淨炷及以燈爐，三法相假後方得燃。	如世人燃燈，要以清油淨炷及以燈爐，三法相假後方得燃。	010	It is like when people light a lamp, they must use clear oil, a clean wick, and a lamp stand. Only when these three factors come together can the lamp be lit.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873c09_14']	「非有為非離」者，言「非有」者，明諸佛所得常住涅槃出世間法體，絕生滅起動、無始終之相，故非有為。	「非有為非離」者，言「非有」者，明諸佛所得常住涅槃出世間法體，絕生滅起動、無始終之相，故非有為。	010	Neither conditioned nor apart from - as for not existent, it clarifies that the essence of the supramundane dharmas attained by the buddhas, which is the eternal nirvana, transcends arising, ceasing, movement, and the characteristics of beginning and end, thus it is not conditioned.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873c10_19']	若非有為者，可條然異處，不住有為法中，故言「非離」。	若非有為者，可條然異處，不住有為法中，故言「非離」。	010	If it is not conditioned, then it can be distinctly separate, not abiding within conditioned dharmas, thus it says not apart from.

['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873c13_12']	故下句云「諸如來涅槃」，明證大涅槃時，不住有為法中，亦不離有為法也。	故下句云「諸如來涅槃」，明證大涅槃時，不住有為法中，亦不離有為法也。	010	Thus the following line says the nirvana of the tathāgatas, clarifying that when realizing great nirvana, one does not abide within conditioned dharmas, yet also does not depart from conditioned dharmas.

It clarifies that the tathāgatas, the buddhas, have attained the correct observation that transcends the world and see that conditioned phenomena are originally quiescent and extinguished, which is precisely the nature of nirvāṇa. It is not the same as the śrāvakas who see the world as different from nirvāṇa, and therefore abandon conditioned phenomena with aversion and grasp at nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873c19_18']	今言有為即涅槃者，是佛性妙有常住涅槃。	今言有為即涅槃者，是佛性妙有常住涅槃。	010	Now, saying that conditioned phenomena are precisely nirvāṇa means that this is the wondrous existence of buddha-nature, the eternally abiding nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T25_1512_010:0873c23_3']	明諸佛如來觀有為法即是性淨涅槃，既見性淨涅槃，斷二障永盡，得此妙智正觀時，能即得彼現果方便涅槃故，不捨有為而住涅槃也。	明諸佛如來觀有為法即是性淨涅槃，既見性淨涅槃，斷二障永盡，得此妙智正觀時，能即得彼現果方便涅槃故，不捨有為而住涅槃也。	010	It clarifies that the tathāgatas, the buddhas, observe conditioned phenomena to be precisely the pure nirvāṇa of nature. Since they see the pure nirvāṇa of nature, they eliminate the two hindrances forever and completely. When they attain this wondrous wisdom and correct observation, they are able to immediately attain the presently manifested nirvāṇa of skillful means.
