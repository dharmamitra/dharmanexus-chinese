It is called wonderful because it is made of the four treasures. The east side is gold, the west is silver, the south is crystal, and the north is agate;
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192b12_2']	餘山唯金故非妙。	餘山唯金故非妙。	005	Other mountains are only gold, so they are not wonderful.

It means that in the center of this mountain peak, there is Indra's palace, with eight terraces on each side, three yojanas away from Indra. In the middle, there is a separate palace city. The thirty-two gods assist Indra, and together with Indra, there are thirty-three.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192b17_1']	今趣釋宮，故云頂也。	今趣釋宮，故云頂也。	005	Now heading to Indra's palace, therefore it is called the peak.

['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192b22_3']	有三意，一以彼是雜鬼神天，顯法非勝，故超過也；	有三意，一以彼是雜鬼神天，顯法非勝，故超過也；	005	There are three meanings. First, since those are the heavens of mixed ghosts and spirits, it shows that the Dharma is not superior, therefore surpassing them;
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192b24_2']	二為寄法，以十信是外凡退位，十住是內凡不退，欲表進退懸殊，故越四天王處也；	二為寄法，以十信是外凡退位，十住是內凡不退，欲表進退懸殊，故越四天王處也；	005	Second, it is to convey the Dharma. The ten faiths are the stage of regression for outer ordinary beings, and the ten abodes are the stage of non-regression for inner ordinary beings. In order to show the vast difference between progress and regression, it skips over the four heavenly kings.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192b26_6']	三若未至山頂容有進退，到山頂上即安住不退，是故越彼山腹處天至此頂處以表法也。	三若未至山頂容有進退，到山頂上即安住不退，是故越彼山腹處天至此頂處以表法也。	005	Third, if one has not yet reached the peak, there may be progress and regression. Once one reaches the peak, one abides in non-regression. Therefore, it skips over the heavens in the mountain's belly and goes to this peak to convey the Dharma.

['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192b29_11']	三前信但是位前方便，方便既滿，正位顯彰，故次來也。	三前信但是位前方便，方便既滿，正位顯彰，故次來也。	005	Third, the previous faith is merely a preliminary expedient before the stage. Once the expedient is complete, the correct stage becomes apparent, so it comes next.

['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192c06_16']	二約法，謂十住教義，義中以平等法界為體、十住行位為相、應教所詮為用，教中以六決定為體、十住不同為相、益機為用，相即無礙，準上思之。	二約法，謂十住教義，義中以平等法界為體、十住行位為相、應教所詮為用，教中以六決定為體、十住不同為相、益機為用，相即無礙，準上思之。	005	Second, in terms of dharmas, it refers to the teachings and principles of the ten abodes. In terms of principles, the equal dharma realm is taken as the essence, the practices and stages of the ten abodes are taken as the characteristics, and the teachings that are expounded are taken as the function. In terms of teachings, the six kinds of certainty are taken as the essence, the differences in the ten abodes are taken as the characteristics, and benefiting beings is taken as the function. The characteristics are unobstructed, which can be understood by analogy based on the above.

This is because it shows that within the stage of the ten abodes, the main theme of the perfection of cause and effect is complete.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0192c12_9']	前中三：	前中三：	005	The first part is divided into three:

Among them, each of the ten directions has Jambudvīpas, etc., which are explained in the chapter on the light of enlightenment. In the worlds of the ten directions, up to the ineffable and inconceivable space and Dharma realms, there are all Vairocana Buddhas under the bodhi tree, each with an assembly of bodhisattvas in the ocean, and together with Mañjuśrī up to Samantabhadra, all of whom are expounding the Dharma.

['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a04_11']	一云：	一云：	005	One says:
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a05_10']	本釋迦身不起道樹，別起應化以昇天上。	本釋迦身不起道樹，別起應化以昇天上。	005	The original Śākyamuni body does not arise from the bodhi tree, but a separate transformed body arises to ascend to the heavens.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a06_15']	若依此釋，昇天之身是重化身，既非深妙，恐乖文意。	若依此釋，昇天之身是重化身，既非深妙，恐乖文意。	005	If this interpretation is followed, the body that ascends to the heavens is a secondary transformed body. Since it is not profound and wondrous, it may contradict the meaning of the text.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a06_18']	一云：	一云：	005	One says:
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a07_10']	不起是法身，昇天是化用。	不起是法身，昇天是化用。	005	Not arising refers to the Dharma body, and ascending to the heavens refers to the function of transformation.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a08_5']	此恐非理，豈可法身坐道樹耶？	此恐非理，豈可法身坐道樹耶？	005	This may not be reasonable. How could the Dharma body sit under the bodhi tree?
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a08_8']	一云：	一云：	005	One says:
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a09_11']	此昇天是不往而至，以往即不往故，所以不起也；	此昇天是不往而至，以往即不往故，所以不起也；	005	This ascending to the heavens is arriving without going, because going is precisely not going, so there is no arising;
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a10_3']	不往即往故，所以昇天也。	不往即往故，所以昇天也。	005	Because not going is precisely going, therefore one ascends to the heavens.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a10_14']	如不來相而來名善來等。	如不來相而來名善來等。	005	It is like the good coming of one who comes without the appearance of coming.

['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a12_17']	今解此文，略有八義：	今解此文，略有八義：	005	Now, there are eight meanings in explaining this text:
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a15_1']	一約處即入門，謂以一處中有一切處故，是故此天宮等即本來在彼樹王下中，故云不起也。	一約處即入門，謂以一處中有一切處故，是故此天宮等即本來在彼樹王下中，故云不起也。	005	First, in terms of place, it means entering the gate. It means that in one place there are all places, therefore this heavenly palace, etc., is originally in the tree king below, so it is said not to rise.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a16_6']	然先未用此天宮處，今欲於中說法用故，說為昇也。	然先未用此天宮處，今欲於中說法用故，說為昇也。	005	However, this place of the heavenly palace was not used before, and now it is used to speak the Dharma, so it is said to ascend.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a17_1']	又相即故不起也，門別故有昇也。	又相即故不起也，門別故有昇也。	005	Moreover, because of the same appearance, it does not rise; because of the different gates, there is ascending.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a18_5']	二約佛，謂此坐樹王下之佛身，即遍法界一切處故。	二約佛，謂此坐樹王下之佛身，即遍法界一切處故。	005	Second, in terms of the Buddha, it means that the Buddha's body sitting under the tree king is universally in all places in the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1733_005:0193a20_13']	是故佛身本來在彼忉利等處故不待起也，今欲用此忉利門中之佛，故曰昇也，是故若起即不成昇也。	是故佛身本來在彼忉利等處故不待起也，今欲用此忉利門中之佛，故曰昇也，是故若起即不成昇也。	005	Therefore, the Buddha's body is originally in the places such as the Heaven of the Thirty-three, so it does not need to rise. Now, it is used to use the Buddha in the gate of the Heaven of the Thirty-three, so it is said to ascend. Therefore, if it rises, it would not be ascending.

['ZH_T35_1733_005:0194b28_9']	今即返此，始覺同本故云悉淨，故不生滅也。	今即返此，始覺同本故云悉淨，故不生滅也。	005	Now, it is the opposite of this. The enlightened mind is the same as the original, therefore it is said to be completely pure, therefore not subject to birth and cessation.
