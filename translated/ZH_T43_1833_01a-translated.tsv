['ZH_T43_1833_01a:0819a22_3']	既云所變必有能變。	既云所變必有能變。	01a	Since it is said that there must be a transformer when there is something transformed,

The question is: Why does the verse say that self and dharmas are called that, and seeing and characteristics are called this? The answer is: The terms that and this are established because of the near and far differences in relation to the self-authenticating part.
['ZH_T43_1833_01a:0819a29_6']	三法轉依遠．近別故。	三法轉依遠．近別故。	01a	The three dharmas transform and rely on each other because of the near and far differences.

['ZH_T43_1833_01a:0819b02_8']	既云思量。	既云思量。	01a	Since it is said to be thinking and measuring,

The answer is: Because the eighth consciousness universally cognizes the three kinds of objects, there is no confusion, so it is not mentioned. If that is so, the sixth consciousness universally cognizes all objects.
