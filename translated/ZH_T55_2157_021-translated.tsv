That sutra was originally translated by the Chang'an monk Shi Daobiao and revised by the Qi dynasty Jiangzhou monk Daoping. After careful consideration, some say this is not so. Shi Daobiao was a monk who interpreted the teachings under Kumarajiva, not the translator. Even if he was the translator, what is lacking in the text and meaning? By the time of the Qi dynasty, the years had passed and the descriptions were different. It is said that the revision by Daoping is difficult to rely on.
