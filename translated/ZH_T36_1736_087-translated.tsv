This is because the three ranks of sages and the ten stages of sages are generally similar, so they are the same as those in the fourth abode before and the same as those in the fourth ground after.

This is because wisdom nourishes concentration, and stillness is never without illumination, while movement is never apart from tranquility, so it is called being without delusion and disturbance.
