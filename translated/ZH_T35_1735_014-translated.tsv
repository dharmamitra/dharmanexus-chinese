['ZH_T35_1735_014:0606a19_11']	偈云「隨解取眾相，顛倒不如實」故。	偈云「隨解取眾相，顛倒不如實」故。	014	The verse says: Following understanding, grasping various characteristics, upside-down, not as it really is.

['ZH_T35_1735_014:0606c13_11']	又別則身受不同，通則受等皆身，是故三偈皆致身言。	又別則身受不同，通則受等皆身，是故三偈皆致身言。	014	Moreover, specifically, the body and feelings are different, but generally, feelings and so forth are all the body. Therefore, the three verses all refer to the body.

['ZH_T35_1735_014:0606c24_4']	又薪火不續識鈍謂輪，命實遷流妄謂相續。	又薪火不續識鈍謂輪，命實遷流妄謂相續。	014	Moreover, when firewood and fire are not continuous, consciousness is dull and considers it a wheel. Life truly flows and changes, but falsely considers it continuous.

The first half clarifies the contemplation of emptiness. Retribution arises from karma, like a dream arising from thought. Because it is unreal, it is empty.

['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607b18_8']	此上皆約生報，前生作故。	此上皆約生報，前生作故。	014	The above is all based on the retribution of the present life, because it was created in a previous life.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607b19_8']	五現作現受名現報，隔一生去受名為後報。	五現作現受名現報，隔一生去受名為後報。	014	The fifth is called present retribution because it is experienced in the present life, and future retribution because it is experienced after skipping a life.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607b21_8']	三「然法界」下結難，謂二無我理即真法界，真法界中定無善惡，未知苦樂從何而生？	三「然法界」下結難，謂二無我理即真法界，真法界中定無善惡，未知苦樂從何而生？	014	The third is the conclusion of the difficulty, which states that the principle of the two kinds of non-self is the true Dharma realm. In the true Dharma realm, there is definitely no good or evil. It is not known from where suffering and joy arise.

['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607b28_14']	法若定有，不可造受，便違正理。	法若定有，不可造受，便違正理。	014	If dharmas definitely exist, they cannot be created or experienced, and this contradicts right reasoning.

The next verse is an analogy for the absence of a creator and experiencer. The third verse is an analogy for the difference in characteristics within the same nature. The last four verses are analogies for the absence of a source for the essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c10_7']	初中，初偈雙喻業果皆真心現，雖無實體而相不同；	初中，初偈雙喻業果皆真心現，雖無實體而相不同；	014	In the first part, the first verse is a double analogy for both karma and its fruits being manifestations of the true mind. Although they have no real substance, their characteristics are not the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c10_17']	次偈喻能生因緣相虛；	次偈喻能生因緣相虛；	014	The next verse is an analogy for the emptiness of the characteristics of the causes that give rise to them.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c11_9']	後偈喻所生業果無實。	後偈喻所生業果無實。	014	The last verse is an analogy for the unreality of the karma and its fruits that are produced.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c11_12']	今初。	今初。	014	Now, the first.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c13_9']	若法相宗唯以本識為鏡，今依法性宗亦以如來藏性而為明鏡，然有二義：	若法相宗唯以本識為鏡，今依法性宗亦以如來藏性而為明鏡，然有二義：	014	If in the Dharma Characteristics School only the fundamental consciousness is taken as the mirror, now in the Dharma Nature School the nature of the Tathāgatagarbha is also taken as the illuminating mirror. However, there are two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c14_10']	一隨境界質現業緣影，故合云業性亦如是。	一隨境界質現業緣影，故合云業性亦如是。	014	First, following the substance of the objective realm, the reflections of karmic conditions are manifested. Therefore, it is combined to say that the nature of karma is also like this.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c15_19']	二隨業緣質現果影像，故前偈云「隨其所行業，如是果報生。	二隨業緣質現果影像，故前偈云「隨其所行業，如是果報生。	014	Second, following the substance of karmic conditions, the reflections of the fruits are manifested. Therefore, the previous verse says, According to the karma one performs, such fruits will be born.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c16_12']	」二文影略，共顯業果似有無體。	」二文影略，共顯業果似有無體。	014	The two passages are abbreviated, together illustrating that karma and its fruits seem to exist but are without substance.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c17_10']	合云業者，謂善惡等三性者通性及相。	合云業者，謂善惡等三性者通性及相。	014	The text says karma refers to the three natures of good, evil, etc., which are both nature and characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c18_17']	謂此業體以無性之法而為其性，不失業果之相而為其性。	謂此業體以無性之法而為其性，不失業果之相而為其性。	014	It means that the essence of this karma takes the dharma of no nature as its nature, and takes the characteristic of not losing the fruit of karma as its nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c19_9']	由無性故，能成業果。	由無性故，能成業果。	014	Because of no nature, it can accomplish the fruit of karma.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c20_1']	由不壞相，方顯真空。	由不壞相，方顯真空。	014	Because of the indestructible characteristic, it then reveals true emptiness.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c21_10']	故《中論》云「雖空亦不斷，雖有而不常，業果亦不失，是名佛所說。	故《中論》云「雖空亦不斷，雖有而不常，業果亦不失，是名佛所說。	014	Therefore, the Zhong lun says: Although empty, it is not cut off; although existent, it is not permanent; the fruit of karma is also not lost; this is called the Buddha's teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c22_1']	」不失業果方顯中道。	」不失業果方顯中道。	014	The fruit of karma not being lost then reveals the middle way.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c23_5']	又如鏡現穢像，非直不污鏡淨，亦乃由此顯鏡踰淨。	又如鏡現穢像，非直不污鏡淨，亦乃由此顯鏡踰淨。	014	It is also like a mirror reflecting a defiled image, not only does it not defile the purity of the mirror, it also reveals that the mirror is even purer because of this.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c25_5']	如來藏現生死業果亦然，非直不損真性平等，亦乃由此知如來藏自性恒淨也。	如來藏現生死業果亦然，非直不損真性平等，亦乃由此知如來藏自性恒淨也。	014	The tathāgatagarbha manifesting the karma and fruit of birth and death is also like this; not only does it not harm the true nature of equality, it also reveals that the tathāgatagarbha's self-nature is always pure because of this.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c25_10']	此有四位：	此有四位：	014	This has four stages:
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c26_1']	一能現位，復有二義：	一能現位，復有二義：	014	The first is the stage of manifestation, which has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c27_1']	一由真淨故現染、二由真淨故不為污。	一由真淨故現染、二由真淨故不為污。	014	First, because of true purity, it manifests defilement; second, because of true purity, it is not defiled.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c27_11']	二所現位，亦有二義：	二所現位，亦有二義：	014	The two states that are manifested also have two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c28_10']	一由相虛故不能污、二由相虛故虛相現。	一由相虛故不能污、二由相虛故虛相現。	014	First, because the characteristics are empty, they cannot defile; second, because the characteristics are empty, empty characteristics are manifested.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0607c29_1']	三相對位，亦有二義：	三相對位，亦有二義：	014	The two relative states also have two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a01_5']	一由分明現染方顯性淨、二由性本恒淨令染妄現。	一由分明現染方顯性淨、二由性本恒淨令染妄現。	014	First, because the clear manifestation of defilement reveals the nature of purity; second, because the nature is originally always pure, it causes the false manifestation of defilement.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a02_4']	四真淨虛染鎔融一味無礙圓融，思之。	四真淨虛染鎔融一味無礙圓融，思之。	014	Fourth, the true purity, the empty defilement, and the fusion into a single flavor are unobstructed and perfectly integrated. Contemplate this.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a03_2']	此約染淨門，以但有所現即為染故。	此約染淨門，以但有所現即為染故。	014	This is based on the gate of defilement and purity, because wherever there is manifestation, it becomes defilement.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a04_2']	更約喻中以一異門釋，謂一鏡是定一門。	更約喻中以一異門釋，謂一鏡是定一門。	014	Again, in the analogy, it is explained based on the gate of sameness and difference, meaning that the single mirror is the gate of sameness.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a05_11']	二所現染淨妍媸等殊是定異門，染淨雖虛不能相攝，故是異也；	二所現染淨妍媸等殊是定異門，染淨雖虛不能相攝，故是異也；	014	Second, the different manifestations of defilement, purity, beauty, ugliness, etc. are the gate of difference. Although defilement and purity are empty, they cannot mutually include each other, so they are different;
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a06_7']	鏡現染處不異現淨，故是一也。	鏡現染處不異現淨，故是一也。	014	The mirror manifesting defilement is no different from manifesting purity, so it is the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a07_4']	三像不異鏡是非異義，鏡外無像故。	三像不異鏡是非異義，鏡外無像故。	014	Third, the image is no different from the mirror, which is the meaning of non-difference, because there is no image outside the mirror.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a08_7']	鏡不異像是非一義，正現像時去像亦失鏡故。	鏡不異像是非一義，正現像時去像亦失鏡故。	014	The mirror is not different from the reflections, and yet it is not the same, because when it is reflecting the reflections, it is also losing the reflections.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a08_16']	上二即非一非異門。	上二即非一非異門。	014	The above two are the gate of neither the same nor different.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a10_7']	四像雖即鏡而不壞像，鏡雖即像而不礙鏡，是亦一亦異門也。	四像雖即鏡而不壞像，鏡雖即像而不礙鏡，是亦一亦異門也。	014	Fourth, although the reflections are the mirror, they do not destroy the reflections; although the mirror is the reflections, it does not obstruct the mirror. This is the gate of both the same and different.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a13_12']	二田種生芽喻能生者，田喻業緣也，種子喻於識種因也，此二相待無性故不相知，由不相知方能生，於後有苦芽，故云自然能出生也。	二田種生芽喻能生者，田喻業緣也，種子喻於識種因也，此二相待無性故不相知，由不相知方能生，於後有苦芽，故云自然能出生也。	014	Second, the field and seeds producing sprouts can produce. The field is a metaphor for the conditions of karma. The seeds are a metaphor for the seeds of consciousness as the cause. Because these two are mutually dependent and have no nature, they do not know each other. Because they do not know each other, they are able to produce the sprouts of suffering in subsequent existence. Therefore it is said that they are naturally able to give rise to.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a14_4']	亦本識為田，名言為種。	亦本識為田，名言為種。	014	It is also the root consciousness as the field, and the names and expressions as the seeds.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a15_9']	三幻師現幻喻喻所生者，若幻色喻報，則幻師喻業；	三幻師現幻喻喻所生者，若幻色喻報，則幻師喻業；	014	Third, the magician manifesting illusions is a metaphor for what is produced. If illusory forms are metaphors for retribution, then the magician is a metaphor for karma;
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a16_3']	若幻色喻業，則幻師喻業因。	若幻色喻業，則幻師喻業因。	014	If illusory forms are metaphors for karma, then the magician is a metaphor for the causes of karma.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a17_1']	以業亦緣生，同報無體，而幻相不亡。	以業亦緣生，同報無體，而幻相不亡。	014	Because karma is also produced from conditions, it is the same as retribution in having no substance, yet the illusory appearances are not lost.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a17_18']	故《中論》內以化復現化喻業果俱空。	故《中論》內以化復現化喻業果俱空。	014	Therefore, in the Madhyamaka-śāstra, the example of a transformation manifesting another transformation is used to illustrate that both karma and its fruits are empty.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a18_9']	若幻唯喻報，業則不空。	若幻唯喻報，業則不空。	014	If the illusion only illustrates the retribution, then karma would not be empty.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a19_3']	四衢以喻四識住，造業處故。	四衢以喻四識住，造業處故。	014	The four-way intersection is used to illustrate the four abodes of consciousness, because it is the place where karma is created.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a19_14']	二機關出聲喻無造受者。	二機關出聲喻無造受者。	014	The second example of two mechanisms producing sounds illustrates that there is no creator or experiencer.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a20_16']	機關緣造，體虛無人，喻業從緣，故無造者。	機關緣造，體虛無人，喻業從緣，故無造者。	014	The mechanisms are created by conditions, their substance is empty and there is no person, illustrating that karma arises from conditions and therefore there is no creator.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a21_17']	從機出聲，尤更非實，喻報因業起，安有受人？	從機出聲，尤更非實，喻報因業起，安有受人？	014	The sound comes from the mechanism, which is even more unreal, illustrating that retribution arises from karma, how can there be a person who experiences it?
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a22_8']	夫無我者，因對我無。	夫無我者，因對我無。	014	As for the absence of self, it is due to the absence of self.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a22_18']	既無有我，何有非我？	既無有我，何有非我？	014	Since there is no self, how can there be non-self?
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a23_7']	著無我者亦是倒故。	著無我者亦是倒故。	014	Because clinging to non-self is also a perversion.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a24_17']	三出㲉音別喻性一相殊者，如鳥在㲉含聲未吐，喻業同一性；	三出㲉音別喻性一相殊者，如鳥在㲉含聲未吐，喻業同一性；	014	The third example of the different sounds from the eggshell illustrates that the nature is one but the characteristics are different. It is like a bird in the eggshell containing the sound but not yet expressing it, illustrating that karma has the same nature;
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a25_9']	出㲉聲別，猶感報無差。	出㲉聲別，猶感報無差。	014	When it comes out of the shell, the sound is different, just as the retribution is without error.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a26_10']	然鷄子之中終無鳳響，業雖無性善惡冥熏。	然鷄子之中終無鳳響，業雖無性善惡冥熏。	014	However, there is never the sound of a phoenix in a chicken egg. Although karma has no nature, good and evil are secretly cultivated.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a27_2']	四有四偈喻體無來處。	四有四偈喻體無來處。	014	The next four verses use four analogies to illustrate that the essence has no place of origin.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a27_17']	皆從緣來，即無來故，然亦不同。	皆從緣來，即無來故，然亦不同。	014	All come from conditions, so there is no coming, but they are also not the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608a29_13']	初一喻因含於果故無來處、次偈果酬於因故無所從，此二喻內異熟業果也。	初一喻因含於果故無來處、次偈果酬於因故無所從，此二喻內異熟業果也。	014	The first analogy illustrates that the cause contains the effect, so there is no place of origin. The next verse illustrates that the effect repays the cause, so there is nowhere it comes from. These two analogies illustrate the internally matured karmic effects.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b01_10']	次偈轉輪王七寶喻外增上業果也。	次偈轉輪王七寶喻外增上業果也。	014	The next verse uses the analogy of the seven treasures of the universal monarch to illustrate the externally increased karmic effects.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b02_20']	後偈喻無漏業果，無漏智火焚蕩有漏，智因漏發，故亦無來。	後偈喻無漏業果，無漏智火焚蕩有漏，智因漏發，故亦無來。	014	The last verse uses an analogy to illustrate the karmic effects of the uncontaminated. The fire of uncontaminated wisdom burns away the contaminated, and contaminated wisdom arises from the contaminated, so it also has no coming.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b03_9']	業果寂然，方依幻住。	業果寂然，方依幻住。	014	Karmic effects are tranquil, and only depend on illusory abodes.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b05_8']	第四說法甚深，亦可名應現甚深，問及答中通三業故，以說法化勝故，從此立名。	第四說法甚深，亦可名應現甚深，問及答中通三業故，以說法化勝故，從此立名。	014	The fourth, the profundity of expounding the Dharma, can also be called the profundity of responding and manifesting, because the question and answer encompass the three karmic activities. Because expounding the Dharma is the supreme teaching, the name is established based on this.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b05_18']	先問中，初總標告問。	先問中，初總標告問。	014	First, in the question, it first generally indicates the question.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b06_7']	德首者，顯佛德故。	德首者，顯佛德故。	014	Foremost in virtue shows the Buddha's virtues.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b06_15']	二正顯問端中三：	二正顯問端中三：	014	Second, in correctly revealing the question, there are three parts:

['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b08_19']	二「云何」下正設疑難，謂證悟既一，說現乃多，為一耶？	二「云何」下正設疑難，謂證悟既一，說現乃多，為一耶？	014	Second, from why is it so below, it is the correct setting up of doubts and difficulties, meaning that since the realization is the same, the teachings manifested are many. Is it one?
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b09_1']	多耶？	多耶？	014	Or many?
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b10_7']	偏取互妨，並立相違，就法即體用相違，約佛是證教相違。	偏取互妨，並立相違，就法即體用相違，約佛是證教相違。	014	Biased grasping obstructs each other, and both established contradictories are mutually exclusive. In terms of the Dharma, it is the contradiction between essence and function. In terms of the Buddha, it is the contradiction between realization and teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b11_4']	下辨十種相違，前九是別、後一總結。	下辨十種相違，前九是別、後一總結。	014	Below, ten kinds of contradictions are distinguished. The first nine are specific, and the last one is a general conclusion.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b12_12']	三「而法性」下釋成前難，謂非唯佛悟於一，我觀法界亦不有多。	三「而法性」下釋成前難，謂非唯佛悟於一，我觀法界亦不有多。	014	Third, from yet the nature of dharmas below, it explains the previous difficulty, meaning that not only does the Buddha realize the one, but I also observe the Dharma realm to be not many.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b14_3']	能證所證既並不殊，以何因緣而現多種，將無如來乖法界耶？	能證所證既並不殊，以何因緣而現多種，將無如來乖法界耶？	014	Since both the realization and the realized are not different, for what causes and conditions does it manifest many kinds? Is it not the case that the Tathāgata goes against the Dharma realm?
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b14_8']	答有二意：	答有二意：	014	The answer has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b15_11']	一云所證雖一，隨機現多，多在物情，佛常無念。	一云所證雖一，隨機現多，多在物情，佛常無念。	014	One says that although the realized is one, it manifests many according to the capacities of beings. The many are in the minds of beings, while the Buddha is always without thought.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b16_13']	二者所悟一法即無礙法界，即事之理全在多中；	二者所悟一法即無礙法界，即事之理全在多中；	014	Second, the one principle that is realized is the unobstructed Dharma realm, which is the principle in phenomena, entirely present in the many;
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b17_8']	所現乃即理之事，全居一內。	所現乃即理之事，全居一內。	014	What is manifested is precisely the phenomena in principle, entirely residing within the one.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b18_16']	以即多之一是所悟，即一之多是所說，既無障礙，何有相違？	以即多之一是所悟，即一之多是所說，既無障礙，何有相違？	014	Since the one in the many is what is realized, and the many in the one is what is explained, since there are no obstructions, how can there be contradictions?
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b20_2']	豈唯不違，亦由得一方能廣現，由多現故方令悟一。	豈唯不違，亦由得一方能廣現，由多現故方令悟一。	014	Not only are there no contradictions, but also because of being able to manifest widely from one perspective, and because of manifesting in the many, it causes the realization of the one.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b20_7']	偈中分二：	偈中分二：	014	The verse is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b20_14']	初一歎問利益。	初一歎問利益。	014	The first praises the benefits of the question.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b21_1']	上半歎深。	上半歎深。	014	The first half praises the profundity.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b21_11']	但言一理，深而非甚；	但言一理，深而非甚；	014	It only speaks of one principle, which is profound but not extremely so;
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b22_2']	今即多是一，故曰甚深。	今即多是一，故曰甚深。	014	Now it is the one in the many, therefore it is called extremely profound.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b23_2']	即一之多尤更難了，不可但以一多知故。	即一之多尤更難了，不可但以一多知故。	014	The many in the one is even more difficult to understand, it cannot be known simply by the one and the many.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b23_16']	下半知益，知此甚深方知愛樂。	下半知益，知此甚深方知愛樂。	014	The second half knows the benefits, knowing this extreme profundity is called knowing and delighting in it.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b24_13']	後九喻答，皆三句喻況、下句法合。	後九喻答，皆三句喻況、下句法合。	014	The last nine similes answer, all with three lines of simile and the last line of Dharma combination.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b25_13']	喻中，皆上二句即體之用、三二兩句即用之寂。	喻中，皆上二句即體之用、三二兩句即用之寂。	014	In the similes, the first two lines in each case are the function based on the essence, and the last two lines are the quiescence of the function.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b26_15']	又初二句以一成多、次句不礙常一，故不相違。	又初二句以一成多、次句不礙常一，故不相違。	014	Moreover, the first two lines show that one can accomplish many, while the next line shows that it does not obstruct the constant oneness, thus there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T35_1735_014:0608b27_14']	然此九喻別答九種無量，總顯境界無量。	然此九喻別答九種無量，總顯境界無量。	014	However, these nine similes specifically answer the nine kinds of immeasurables, and generally show that the realm is immeasurable.
