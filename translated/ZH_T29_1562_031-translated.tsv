The lower world systems are destroyed by the three calamities. After a long time, in the empty space below, due to the power of the increased karma of sentient beings, a slight wind arises, which gradually increases and forms a wheel by coiling and solidifying.

['ZH_T29_1562_031:0515a10_19']	如是水輪，於未凝結位，深十一億二萬踰繕那，廣稱風輪，有言狹小。	如是水輪，於未凝結位，深十一億二萬踰繕那，廣稱風輪，有言狹小。	031	In this way, the water wheel, in its uncongealed state, is eleven koṭīs and twenty thousand yojanas deep, and is said to be as wide as the wind wheel. Some say it is smaller.
['ZH_T29_1562_031:0515a12_7']	有情業力持令不散，如所食飲未熟變時終不移流墮於熟藏。	有情業力持令不散，如所食飲未熟變時終不移流墮於熟藏。	031	Sentient beings’ karma causes it to be held and not scattered, just as food and drink not yet digested do not flow downward into the intestines.

Therefore the water wheel decreases to a thickness of only eight koṭis, and the remainder transforms into gold, three million two hundred thousand yojanas thick.
['ZH_T29_1562_031:0515a17_6']	二輪界別有百俱胝，一一二輪廣量皆等，謂徑十二億三千四百半。	二輪界別有百俱胝，一一二輪廣量皆等，謂徑十二億三千四百半。	031	The two wheels are separate and consist of one hundred koṭis. The breadth of each of the two wheels is the same, namely, twelve koṭis, three hundred and forty-five yojanas.

Great clouds arise and rain falls on the golden wheel above in drops like chariot axles for a long time, accumulating water that rushes and surges to a depth exceeding eighty thousand yojanas. Fierce winds churn and strike, and treasures and so on are transformed and born.
