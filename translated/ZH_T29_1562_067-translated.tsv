It takes the pure holy path as its essence, not the worldly path, because it can completely and ultimately pacify all faults.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706b08_13']	由此異生雖能已斷無所有處染，而非真沙門，以諸過失尚有餘故，暫時靜息非究竟故。	由此異生雖能已斷無所有處染，而非真沙門，以諸過失尚有餘故，暫時靜息非究竟故。	For this reason, although ordinary beings are able to eliminate the defilements of the sphere of nothingness, they are not true śramaṇas, because faults still remain for them, and temporary pacification is not ultimate.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706b10_4']	既無漏道是沙門性，通以有為無為為果，故沙門果體通有為無為。	既無漏道是沙門性，通以有為無為為果，故沙門果體通有為無為。	Since the pure path is the nature of the śramaṇa, and its fruits are both conditioned and unconditioned, therefore the essence of the fruits of the śramaṇa are both conditioned and unconditioned.

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706b17_14']	見斷法斷欲修斷斷，是謂無為不還果體。	見斷法斷欲修斷斷，是謂無為不還果體。	The abandonment of dharmas that are eliminated by the path of insight and the abandonment of the proclivities that are eliminated by the path of cultivation in the realm of desire is called the unconditioned nature of the fruit of non-returning.

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706b28_14']	一切種者，謂斷自性及斷能緣即名永斷，唯見苦斷諸法斷位。	一切種者，謂斷自性及斷能緣即名永斷，唯見苦斷諸法斷位。	All kinds means that the abandonment of the intrinsic nature and the abandonment of the object are called the abandonment of all. Only the abandonment of dharmas abandoned by seeing suffering is so.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706b29_8']	見苦斷法，已斷自性未斷能緣；	見苦斷法，已斷自性未斷能緣；	Dharmas abandoned by seeing suffering have already abandoned their intrinsic nature but have not yet abandoned their objects;

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c04_13']	譬喻者說沙門果體唯是無為，由教理故。	譬喻者說沙門果體唯是無為，由教理故。	The Sautrāntikas say that the substance of the fruits of the śramaṇa is only unconditioned dharmas, because of teachings and principles.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c06_10']	教如前說，今當辯理，以諸有為是可壞故不可保信，沙門果體是可保信故唯無為。	教如前說，今當辯理，以諸有為是可壞故不可保信，沙門果體是可保信故唯無為。	The teachings are as explained above. We will now explain the principles. Because all conditioned dharmas are perishable and cannot be relied upon, the substance of the fruits of the śramaṇa can be relied upon and therefore is only unconditioned.

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c09_19']	契經雖言預流果體謂斷三結，而不言唯，如四修定中現法樂住定。	契經雖言預流果體謂斷三結，而不言唯，如四修定中現法樂住定。	Although a scripture says that the substance of the fruit of the stream-enterer is the severing of the three bonds, it does not say that it is only that, just as in the case of the four kinds of samādhi for attaining bliss in the present life.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c11_7']	謂經說此是初靜慮，然實此定理亦通餘，故不言唯顯有別意。	謂經說此是初靜慮，然實此定理亦通餘，故不言唯顯有別意。	That is, a scripture says that this is the first trance state, but in reality this samādhi is also common to the other trance states. Therefore, the phrase “only” shows that there is another meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c11_17']	此經亦爾，不應固執。	此經亦爾，不應固執。	This scripture is the same and should not be insisted upon as definitely meaning only the first trance state.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c13_8']	若謂有餘經說現法樂住通四靜慮，此不爾者，理亦不然，與彼同故。	若謂有餘經說現法樂住通四靜慮，此不爾者，理亦不然，與彼同故。	If you say that there is another scripture that says that attaining bliss in the present life is common to the four trance states, and that this is not so in the case of the fruit of the stream-enterer, this is not reasonable, because it is the same as the other case.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c14_7']	謂餘經說六法永斷名為預流，豈唯三結？	謂餘經說六法永斷名為預流，豈唯三結？	Other scriptures say that the five aggregates are permanently eliminated and called the fruit of stream-entry. How can it be said that only the three bonds are eliminated?
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c15_5']	又預流者，理實亦應有邊執見及貪等斷。	又預流者，理實亦應有邊執見及貪等斷。	Also, in the case of the stream-enterer, the view of grasping extremes and the elimination of craving, etc., are also in principle eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c16_7']	此非預流果，無別證因，由此彼所言不令生喜。	此非預流果，無別證因，由此彼所言不令生喜。	This is not the fruit of stream-entry, because there is no separate cause for realization. Therefore, what they say does not give rise to joy.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c17_6']	故非由此所引契經，證唯無為是沙門果。	故非由此所引契經，證唯無為是沙門果。	Therefore, the scriptures they cite do not prove that only the unconditioned is the fruit of the religious practitioner.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c18_7']	理亦非理，若無顛倒智望無為法最可保信故。	理亦非理，若無顛倒智望無為法最可保信故。	Reason also does not allow it. If the knowledge that is not erroneously inverted is most reliable with respect to unconditioned dharmas,
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c20_7']	謂觀行者如實智生，能自了知我生盡等，雖是可壞法而極可保信，以能顯了無倒義故。	謂觀行者如實智生，能自了知我生盡等，雖是可壞法而極可保信，以能顯了無倒義故。	then when the knowledge of the practitioner of contemplation arises as it really is, he can himself understand that his births are exhausted, etc. Although these are dharmas that can be destroyed, they are extremely reliable, because they are able to manifest the meaning of non-erroneous inversion.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c21_6']	由此定知四沙門果，其體通攝有為無為。	由此定知四沙門果，其體通攝有為無為。	Therefore, it is definitely known that the four fruits of the religious practitioner include both conditioned and unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c22_6']	復有至教證沙門果亦通有為，如契經說：	復有至教證沙門果亦通有為，如契經說：	There is also a definitive teaching that proves that the fruits of the religious practitioner also include conditioned dharmas, as a scripture says:

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c25_10']	唯依有為法立補特伽羅，補特伽羅由果顯了，故知果體亦通有為。	唯依有為法立補特伽羅，補特伽羅由果顯了，故知果體亦通有為。	The person is established on the basis of conditioned dharmas, and the person is manifested by the fruit. Therefore we know that the substance of the fruit also includes conditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c26_17']	然譬喻宗理最不可，依無為立補特伽羅，彼執無為無有體故。	然譬喻宗理最不可，依無為立補特伽羅，彼執無為無有體故。	However, the theory of the Vātsīputrīyas is the most unreasonable, because they establish the person on the basis of the unconditioned. This is because they hold that the unconditioned has no substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c28_14']	不應無體法為立假者因，謂彼執無為唯不轉為相，故不可依託立補特伽羅。	不應無體法為立假者因，謂彼執無為唯不轉為相，故不可依託立補特伽羅。	It is not proper for a dharma that has no substance to be the cause for establishing a hypothetical person, because they hold that the unconditioned is characterized only by non-transformation, and therefore it cannot be relied upon to establish the person.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0706c29_14']	若謂但依彼得建立，得是道故，必是有為。	若謂但依彼得建立，得是道故，必是有為。	If you say that it is established on the basis of the possession of that , because that is a path and therefore must be conditioned,
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a02_14']	由此應知，依向果道建立八種補特伽羅，補特伽羅既依道立，道體通向果，果豈唯無為？	由此應知，依向果道建立八種補特伽羅，補特伽羅既依道立，道體通向果，果豈唯無為？	then you should understand that the eight kinds of persons are established on the basis of the path that is the objective of the fruit. Since the person is established on the basis of the path, and the substance of the path includes both the objective of the path and the fruit, how can the fruit be only unconditioned?
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a04_2']	又設劬勞求得名果，果位攝道既是所求，如何可言彼道非果？	又設劬勞求得名果，果位攝道既是所求，如何可言彼道非果？	Moreover, if you seek and obtain it after great effort, it is called the fruit. The path included in the state of the fruit is that which is sought. How can you say that that path is not the fruit?
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a04_11']	如何知道亦是所求？	如何知道亦是所求？	How do we know that knowledge is also what is sought?

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a08_13']	無相心定以解為果。	無相心定以解為果。	The concentration of signless mind has liberation as its fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a10_8']	解體即是盡無生智，定即沙門，此即顯成阿毘達磨說沙門果體通有為無為。	解體即是盡無生智，定即沙門，此即顯成阿毘達磨說沙門果體通有為無為。	Liberation is precisely the knowledge of the exhaustion of defilements and the knowledge of non-arising. Concentration is precisely the religious practitioner. This then clarifies the Abhidharma's statement that the essence of the fruits of the religious practitioner includes both conditioned and unconditioned dharmas.

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a13_16']	或以無為法是果非有果，道通二種故略不說。	或以無為法是果非有果，道通二種故略不說。	Or, because unconditioned dharmas are fruits but not causes, while the path is common to both, it is not mentioned in brief.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a14_15']	或無為法離有為過，為令欣樂是故偏說。	或無為法離有為過，為令欣樂是故偏說。	Or, because unconditioned dharmas are free from the faults of conditioned dharmas, they are mentioned in particular in order to cause delight.
['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a16_13']	或此唯說無為果經，是有餘言，不應封執，謂此唯說三結斷等，不遍說餘煩惱斷故。	或此唯說無為果經，是有餘言，不應封執，謂此唯說三結斷等，不遍說餘煩惱斷故。	Or this scripture speaks only of unconditioned fruits, and the words “only” are not to be taken literally. It means that it speaks only of the elimination of the three bonds, etc., and does not speak of the elimination of other passions.

['ZH_T29_1562_067:0707a17_11']	心速迴轉精進能證無上菩提。	心速迴轉精進能證無上菩提。	“The mind is swift in its changes, and it is through exertion that one can realize supreme bodhi.”
