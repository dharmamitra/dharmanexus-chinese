['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451a24_7']	由序已竟，正宗宜開，將顯一乘為真實故，前開三乘為方便，故次明〈方便品〉。	由序已竟，正宗宜開，將顯一乘為真實故，前開三乘為方便，故次明〈方便品〉。	Since the introduction has been completed, the main theme should be opened.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451a26_17']	上根之徒聞前法說即便領悟，中根之者未能忘言會法，可以虛心待譬，故次明〈譬喻品〉，稟前法說、飡後譬喻。	上根之徒聞前法說即便領悟，中根之者未能忘言會法，可以虛心待譬，故次明〈譬喻品〉，稟前法說、飡後譬喻。	Those of the highest capacity, upon hearing the previous doctrinal explanation, immediately understand. Those of the middling capacity are still unable to forget words and unite with the Dharma. They can empty their minds and wait for the parables, so the chapter on parables is explained next.

Therefore, the beginning of the past karmic connection is explained, and the present parable of the illusory city is told, so there is the chapter on the parable of the illusory city.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451b04_17']	下根之人聞上二周之說及後宿世因緣，便得領解堪與授記，故有〈五百弟子受記品〉。	下根之人聞上二周之說及後宿世因緣，便得領解堪與授記，故有〈五百弟子受記品〉。	Those of the lowest capacity, hearing the teachings of the two previous chapters and the subsequent chapter on the causes and conditions of the past, then attained understanding and were worthy of receiving predictions, thus there is the chapter on The Prediction for the Five Hundred Disciples.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451b14_10']	既於惡世欲弘善道多諸苦難，故辨弘經之方，令安住四行身心快樂，故有〈安樂行品〉。	既於惡世欲弘善道多諸苦難，故辨弘經之方，令安住四行身心快樂，故有〈安樂行品〉。	Since in the evil world one wishes to propagate the good path, there are many hardships and difficulties.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451b25_13']	自前諸品歎法美人其義已顯，十方諸佛見二世眾生信持此經心生歡喜，現七種神力，故有〈神力品〉。	自前諸品歎法美人其義已顯，十方諸佛見二世眾生信持此經心生歡喜，現七種神力，故有〈神力品〉。	From before, the chapters praise the Dharma and the beautiful person, and their meaning is already evident.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451b29_13']	今說此本緣利益時會，故有〈藥王本事品〉。	今說此本緣利益時會，故有〈藥王本事品〉。	Now, in order to benefit those present at the assembly, he speaks of this fundamental cause, hence the Chapter on the Past Activities of the Medicine King.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c02_14']	藥王雖報恩供養猶未辨宣通此法，故召彼妙音明分身六趣為物弘經，故有〈妙音菩薩品〉。	藥王雖報恩供養猶未辨宣通此法，故召彼妙音明分身六趣為物弘經，故有〈妙音菩薩品〉。	Although the Medicine King repays kindness and makes offerings, he still has not clarified the propagation of this Dharma, so he summons that Wonderful Sound to clarify the manifestation of bodies in the six destinies for the sake of beings and the propagation of the sutra, hence the Chapter on the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c14_4']	一者從法受名，如〈方便品〉等，二者從譬為目，如〈譬喻品〉等，三者從人受稱，如〈提婆達多品〉等，四從事為目，如〈涌出品〉等。	一者從法受名，如〈方便品〉等，二者從譬為目，如〈譬喻品〉等，三者從人受稱，如〈提婆達多品〉等，四從事為目，如〈涌出品〉等。	First, taking the name from the Dharma, such as the chapter on skillful means; second, taking the name from a simile, such as the chapter on parables; third, taking the name from a person, such as the chapter on Devadatta; fourth, taking the name from an event, such as the chapter on the emergence of the earth.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c15_5']	二義立名者，或人法雙舉，如〈觀世音普門品〉等；	二義立名者，或人法雙舉，如〈觀世音普門品〉等；	Being named by two meanings means either the person and Dharma are both mentioned, such as the chapter on Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva's Universal Gate;
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c15_21']	或能所合為目，如〈見寶塔品〉等。	或能所合為目，如〈見寶塔品〉等。	Or the subject and object are combined to form the name, such as the chapter on seeing the jeweled stupa.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c17_13']	三義立名者，如〈五百弟子受記品〉，五百是數名，弟子是其人稱，受記是其法目。	三義立名者，如〈五百弟子受記品〉，五百是數名，弟子是其人稱，受記是其法目。	As for the third meaning of establishing the name, it is like the Chapter on the Predictions Given to the Five Hundred Disciples. Five hundred is a numerical name, disciples is a designation for people, and receiving predictions is a Dharma title.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c17_15']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c18_3']	品名為是佛說？	品名為是佛說？	Are the chapter names spoken by the Buddha?
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c18_16']	為是集經者安，為後人所製？	為是集經者安，為後人所製？	Are they arranged by the compilers of the sūtras, or are they composed by later people?
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c18_18']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c19_2']	具有三義：	具有三義：	They have all three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c20_14']	一者、若經文內標於品名，如云「聞是藥王本事品功德無量」，蓋是佛說。	一者、若經文內標於品名，如云「聞是藥王本事品功德無量」，蓋是佛說。	First, if the chapter name is labeled within the sūtra text, like saying the merit of hearing this chapter on the past events of the Medicine King is immeasurable, it is spoken by the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c22_2']	二者、若標於品名置在文初，蓋是集法藏人取佛語意故製品名。	二者、若標於品名置在文初，蓋是集法藏人取佛語意故製品名。	Second, if the chapter name is labeled at the beginning of the text, it is a product of the compilers of the Dharma treasury taking the Buddha's words and meaning.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c23_6']	三者、如《大品》等九十章經無有品名，悉是後人所製故。	三者、如《大品》等九十章經無有品名，悉是後人所製故。	Third, sūtras like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra with ninety chapters do not have chapter names, they are all composed by later people.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c23_21']	叡法師《大品．序》述什公語云：	叡法師《大品．序》述什公語云：	Master Rui's preface to the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra states Master Kumārajīva's words:
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c25_2']	「《大品經》但有三品，謂〈序品〉、〈魔事品〉、〈阿鞞跋致品〉。	「《大品經》但有三品，謂〈序品〉、〈魔事品〉、〈阿鞞跋致品〉。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra only has three chapters: the Introduction Chapter, the Māra Chapter, and the A-bi-bō-zhì Chapter.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c25_20']	以品非佛說，故略去其二唯留〈序品〉。	以品非佛說，故略去其二唯留〈序品〉。	Because the chapters are not spoken by the Buddha, the two are omitted and only the Introduction Chapter is retained.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c26_10']	」故知非佛說，後人製之也。	」故知非佛說，後人製之也。	Therefore, it is known that they were not spoken by the Buddha, but composed by later people.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c28_12']	第三、論品前後者，諸經〈囑累品〉多在經末，至如此經安〈神力品〉後者，依於梵本及《法華論》。	第三、論品前後者，諸經〈囑累品〉多在經末，至如此經安〈神力品〉後者，依於梵本及《法華論》。	Third, regarding the sequence of the chapters, the entrustment chapters of various sūtras are mostly at the end of the sūtras. As for placing it after the Divine Power Chapter in this sūtra, it is based on the Sanskrit text and the Fahua Lun.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0451c29_14']	又即此秦地新翻《法華》，並安〈囑累品〉在於經末。	又即此秦地新翻《法華》，並安〈囑累品〉在於經末。	Moreover, in the newly translated Lotus Sūtra in the Qin land, the Entrustment Chapter is also placed at the end of the sūtra.

Placing the Entrustment Chapter after the Divine Power Chapter must have a profound reason.

The Buddhas of the transformed bodies come to reveal the Buddha's long life span. Since the long life span is already revealed, they each return to their original lands and the land reverts to its defiled state. This chapter's meaning is concluded, so it is entrusted.

Since the two vehicles of cause and effect are already complete, the assembly disperses. For this causal condition, the Chapter on Entrustment is placed before the Chapter on the Medicine King.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0452a17_7']	又〈囑累〉一品既明付屬，〈藥王〉等品即是受命弘經。	又〈囑累〉一品既明付屬，〈藥王〉等品即是受命弘經。	Moreover, since the Chapter on Entrustment already clarifies the entrustment, the Chapter on the Medicine King and other chapters are the acceptance of the order to propagate the sūtra.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0452b01_15']	」羅什既在龜茲國，不見此品故不翻之。	」羅什既在龜茲國，不見此品故不翻之。	Since Kumarajiva was in the country of Kucha, he did not see this chapter and therefore did not translate it.

If he had translated the entire Treatise on the Stages of Concentration Practice, it would have been ten times longer than this, but fearing it would be difficult to seek out, he abridged it to one hundred fascicles.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0453c06_12']	次雙覆者，脫珍御服著弊垢衣，以身方便覆身真實，隱於傍使更遣餘人，即是以乘方便覆乘真實，謂雙覆也。	次雙覆者，脫珍御服著弊垢衣，以身方便覆身真實，隱於傍使更遣餘人，即是以乘方便覆乘真實，謂雙覆也。	Next, the double concealment refers to taking off precious garments and putting on tattered, dirty clothes, using bodily skillful means to conceal the true body, hiding the attendants and instead sending other people, which is using the vehicle skillful means to conceal the true vehicle, which is the double concealment.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0453c08_12']	三雙開者，明昔三乘是方便、今一乘為真實，辨昔身是方便、今身為真實，謂雙開也。	三雙開者，明昔三乘是方便、今一乘為真實，辨昔身是方便、今身為真實，謂雙開也。	Third, the double revelation refers to explaining that the three vehicles of the past were skillful means and the one vehicle of the present is the truth, and distinguishing that the body of the past was skillful means and the body of the present is the truth, which is the double revelation.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0453c09_11']	然乘之與身更無二體，即一正觀隨宜說之。	然乘之與身更無二體，即一正觀隨宜說之。	However, the vehicle and the body are essentially not two, but are one correct contemplation explained according to suitability.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0453c10_19']	運用自在故名為乘，體可軌模故名為法，以法為身故稱法身。	運用自在故名為乘，體可軌模故名為法，以法為身故稱法身。	Because of freely using and applying it, it is called the vehicle. Because its essence can serve as a model, it is called the Dharma. Because the Dharma is the body, it is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0453c12_1']	流通二者，始從格量偈竟〈神力品〉謂讚歎流通；	流通二者，始從格量偈竟〈神力品〉謂讚歎流通；	Second, from the verses on evaluation to the chapter on spiritual powers, it is called the praise and dissemination.

['ZH_T34_1721_001:0453c15_9']	所以明此二者，將欲付囑使物弘宣，必須讚法功深美人德重，物欣此利然後受命弘經，故前明讚歎、後辨付囑。	所以明此二者，將欲付囑使物弘宣，必須讚法功深美人德重，物欣此利然後受命弘經，故前明讚歎、後辨付囑。	The reason for clarifying these two is that in order to entrust and spread the teaching to others, one must praise the profound merit of the Dharma and the weighty virtue of the person. People will delight in this benefit and then accept the mission to spread the sutra. Therefore, the praise is explained first, followed by the entrustment.

In this case, their minds are superior but their forms are inferior, so they are in the second place;
['ZH_T34_1721_001:0457b14_8']	凡夫心形兩劣，所以居第三。	凡夫心形兩劣，所以居第三。	Ordinary people are inferior in both mind and form, so they are in the third place.

It is said that before the tenth stage, the first six minds are not yet established in provisional understanding, and they regress from the bodhi mind to become two vehicles.

The sixth is called the mind of non-regression. Since the five roots are already established, one later attains non-regression.

Because one relies on good and virtuous friends, one is able to plant various roots of goodness and is therefore protected and remembered by the buddhas. This is called the skillful means of embracing good and virtuous friends.
