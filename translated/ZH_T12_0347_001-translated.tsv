Due to meritorious karma, one obtains the body of the gods and experiences the superior blissful fruits. Or, abandoning the body of the gods, due to evil karma, one obtains the retribution of hell and experiences the fruits of various sufferings. Transmigrating and changing, one becomes various bodies. Consciousness is like saffron, madder, and lotus flowers, whose seeds are all white. If one breaks open the seeds, one does not see the sprouts or flowers, nor does one see different colors. If one plants them in the ground and moistens them with water, sprouts and so forth will grow in accordance with the season, and the flowers and fruits will bloom in various colors, such as red and white. The colors are not in the seeds, but apart from the seeds, they cannot grow.

Consciousness, with its wonderful vision, hearing, sound, touch, taste, dharmas, and mental faculties, knows the good and evil karma that has been created and takes on a bodily retribution, like a silkworm making a cocoon, binding itself and transforming within it;

Consciousness itself produces the body and then wraps itself up. It abandons the body and receives other karmic retributions. Because there are seeds, there are form, smell, and taste. Consciousness abandons the body and follows its transformations. The faculties, objects, and the realm of dharmas all follow it.

Form is the cause of the body. There is no body of bones and flesh, but there are faculties. There is the experience of wonderful thoughts, knowing to accept good and evil, like various fruits such as jujubes, pomegranates, mangos, apricots, coconuts, and melons, which may be spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, salty, or astringent, with different flavors and powers, nourishing digestion in different ways, and when the fruits decay, the flavors and powers follow the seeds to transform and grow.

Because consciousness sustains the body, the body knows suffering and pleasure, the complexion is radiant, and the activities of coming and going, speaking, laughing, worrying, and so forth are clearly evident, one should know that there is consciousness.
