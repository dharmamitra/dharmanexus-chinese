['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a12_17']	三法者，一法身清淨因、二佛智德生因、三佛恩德因。	三法者，一法身清淨因、二佛智德生因、三佛恩德因。	As for the three dharmas, first is the cause of the purity of the Dharma body, second is the cause of the arising of the wisdom and virtue of the Buddha, and third is the cause of the virtue of the Buddha's beneficence.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a13_13']	法身清淨因者，修習信樂大乘應知。	法身清淨因者，修習信樂大乘應知。	As for the cause of the purity of the Dharma body, it should be known that it is cultivated by faith and joy in the Great Vehicle.

['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a17_2']	修習信樂大乘者，與器相似，此中有無量定慧大寶所遍滿故，故說與器相似。	修習信樂大乘者，與器相似，此中有無量定慧大寶所遍滿故，故說與器相似。	Those who cultivate faith and joy in the Great Vehicle are similar to a vessel, because it is filled with immeasurable samādhis, prajñā, and great treasures, and thus it is said to be similar to a vessel.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a18_2']	修習般若禪定與寶相似者，般若無分別故；	修習般若禪定與寶相似者，般若無分別故；	Cultivating prajñā and dhyāna concentration is similar to treasures, because prajñā is non-discriminating,
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a18_16']	禪定不可思惟，功德所依止故。	禪定不可思惟，功德所依止故。	and dhyāna concentration is the basis of inconceivable merits.

['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a21_4']	修習菩薩大悲如清淨水，於一切世間眾生潤滑一味故，譬如大海唯一醎味。	修習菩薩大悲如清淨水，於一切世間眾生潤滑一味故，譬如大海唯一醎味。	Cultivating the great compassion of bodhisattvas is like pure water, because it moistens all beings in the world with a single flavor, just as the great ocean has only a single salty taste.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a23_4']	菩薩大悲潤諸眾生亦復如是，故此三法於因地中為所依能依，故說總攝名如來法海。	菩薩大悲潤諸眾生亦復如是，故此三法於因地中為所依能依，故說總攝名如來法海。	The great compassion of bodhisattvas moistening all beings is also like this. Therefore, these three dharmas are the basis and that which is based upon in the stage of causes, and thus it is said that they comprehensively include the Dharma of the Tathāgatas.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a23_9']	是名因攝。	是名因攝。	This is called inclusion by causes.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a24_18']	次由果攝者，明如來法身有三種法，與三譬相似故，能總攝三譬。	次由果攝者，明如來法身有三種法，與三譬相似故，能總攝三譬。	Next, inclusion by results means that the Dharma body of the Tathāgatas has three kinds of dharmas that are similar to three metaphors, and thus they are able to comprehensively include the three metaphors.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a25_7']	相似者，如日有三：	相似者，如日有三：	The similar aspects are like the sun having three things:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a25_16']	一體、二光、三明。	一體、二光、三明。	The essence, the light, and the brightness.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a26_3']	此與三身相似故。	此與三身相似故。	This is similar to the three bodies, so it is mentioned.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a26_7']	三法者：	三法者：	The three dharmas are:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a26_19']	一神通、二流滅、三顯淨。	一神通、二流滅、三顯淨。	The spiritual powers, the cessation of the flow, and the manifestation of purity.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801a28_11']	一神通者，譬日有明，能除障自境界無明之暗，以為事用故，與日明相似。	一神通者，譬日有明，能除障自境界無明之暗，以為事用故，與日明相似。	The first spiritual power is like the sun having brightness, which can remove the darkness of ignorance in its own realm, and take that as its function, so it is similar to the sun's brightness.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b01_4']	二流滅者，謂盡、無生智能燒除業煩惱令無餘，以為事用故，與日光相似。	二流滅者，謂盡、無生智能燒除業煩惱令無餘，以為事用故，與日光相似。	The second cessation of the flow refers to the wisdom of exhaustion and non-arising that can burn away karma and afflictions without remainder, and take that as its function, so it is similar to the sun's light.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b01_20']	所言滅者，即是真智，正能除惑故。	所言滅者，即是真智，正能除惑故。	What is called cessation is precisely true wisdom, which can directly remove delusions.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b02_19']	與滅名盡者，即惑無時名為解脫，故與盡稱。	與滅名盡者，即惑無時名為解脫，故與盡稱。	What is called exhaustion is the time when delusions are gone, which is called liberation, so it is called exhaustion.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b04_12']	三顯淨者，謂盡、無生境名轉依，極清淨故、無垢故、澄靜故，與日輪相似。	三顯淨者，謂盡、無生境名轉依，極清淨故、無垢故、澄靜故，與日輪相似。	The third manifestation of purity refers to the realm of exhaustion and non-arising, which is called the transformation of the basis, because it is extremely pure, free from defilements, and clear and still, and is similar to the sun's orb.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b05_1']	清淨者，解脫障滅故。	清淨者，解脫障滅故。	Purity means the removal of the obstacle of liberation.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b05_12']	無垢者，一切智障滅故。	無垢者，一切智障滅故。	Being immaculate means that all cognitive hindrances are eliminated.

['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b07_8']	轉依者，勝聲聞、獨覺、菩薩三人所依止法故。	轉依者，勝聲聞、獨覺、菩薩三人所依止法故。	Being the basis of transformation means that it is the basis for the three types of people: śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b07_16']	又有四種相應知：	又有四種相應知：	There are also four aspects that should be known:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b09_1']	一者為生依、二滅依、三善熟思量果、四法界清淨相。	一者為生依、二滅依、三善熟思量果、四法界清淨相。	1) being the basis for arising, 2) being the basis for cessation, 3) being the well-considered result, and 4) being the pure characteristic of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b11_6']	一生依者，佛無分別道相續依止，若不緣此法，無分別道即不得生，以依緣此故，名此法為道生依。	一生依者，佛無分別道相續依止，若不緣此法，無分別道即不得生，以依緣此故，名此法為道生依。	1) As for being the basis for arising, the Buddha's path of non-discrimination is the continuous basis. If it does not take this Dharma as its object, the path of non-discrimination would not be able to arise. Because it relies on this as its object, this Dharma is called the basis for the arising of the path.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b12_11']	二滅依者，一切諸惑及習氣究竟滅不生，無所依止故。	二滅依者，一切諸惑及習氣究竟滅不生，無所依止故。	2) As for being the basis for cessation, all afflictions and habitual tendencies are ultimately extinguished and do not arise again, because there is no basis for them.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b13_17']	若不依此轉依法究竟滅惑者，則聲聞獨覺與佛滅惑不異。	若不依此轉依法究竟滅惑者，則聲聞獨覺與佛滅惑不異。	If the ultimate cessation of afflictions did not rely on this transformed basis, then the cessation of afflictions by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas would be no different from that of the Buddha.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b14_15']	由不同故，故知此法為究竟滅惑依止。	由不同故，故知此法為究竟滅惑依止。	Because they are not the same, we know that this dharma is the ultimate basis for the cessation of delusions.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b16_11']	三善熟思量果者，善正通達長時恭敬無間無餘等修習所知真如，是轉依果。	三善熟思量果者，善正通達長時恭敬無間無餘等修習所知真如，是轉依果。	Third, the fruit of good and thorough contemplation: the realization of the suchness of objects of knowledge through long-term respectful cultivation without interruption or remainder is the fruit of the transformation of the basis.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b17_1']	若在道中，轉依為因；	若在道中，轉依為因；	If it is in the path, the transformation of the basis is the cause;
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b17_11']	若在道後，即名為果。	若在道後，即名為果。	if it is after the path, it is then called the fruit.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b18_20']	若轉依非是善熟思量果者，則諸佛自性應更熟思量、更滅、更淨。	若轉依非是善熟思量果者，則諸佛自性應更熟思量、更滅、更淨。	If the transformation of the basis were not the fruit of good and thorough contemplation, then the intrinsic nature of the buddhas would have to be further contemplated, further extinguished, and further purified.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b19_16']	而不然者，故知轉依為善熟思量之果。	而不然者，故知轉依為善熟思量之果。	But since this is not so, we know that the transformation of the basis is the fruit of good and thorough contemplation.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b20_15']	四法界清淨相者，一切妄想於中滅盡故。	四法界清淨相者，一切妄想於中滅盡故。	Fourth, the characteristic of the purity of the dharma realm: all false imaginations are extinguished within it.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b22_1']	此法界過思量、過言說所顯現故，故以法界清淨為相。	此法界過思量、過言說所顯現故，故以法界清淨為相。	Because this dharma realm is manifested beyond thought and beyond speech, it is therefore characterized by the purity of the dharma realm.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b23_8']	此即心行處滅、言語道斷，不可詮詺，方是得無所得真如理故。	此即心行處滅、言語道斷，不可詮詺，方是得無所得真如理故。	This is where the activity of the mind ceases and the path of language is cut off. It cannot be described or designated, because it is the attainment of the suchness of non-attainment.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b24_5']	復次如來轉依有八種法攝持應知。	復次如來轉依有八種法攝持應知。	Furthermore, it should be known that the Tathāgata's transformation of the basis is subsumed by eight dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b26_4']	八法者，一不可思量、二無二、三無分別、四清淨、五照了因、六對治、七離欲、八離欲因。	八法者，一不可思量、二無二、三無分別、四清淨、五照了因、六對治、七離欲、八離欲因。	The eight dharmas are: 1) inconceivable, 2) non-dual, 3) non-discriminating, 4) pure, 5) cause of illumination, 6) counteragent, 7) detachment, and 8) cause of detachment.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b26_11']	此八合有二意：	此八合有二意：	These eight have two meanings in total:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b26_19']	一離欲，是滅諦；	一離欲，是滅諦；	1) detachment, which is the truth of cessation;
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b27_8']	二離欲因，即是道諦。	二離欲因，即是道諦。	2) the cause of detachment, which is the truth of the path.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b28_13']	前不可思量等三句屬滅諦攝，次清淨等三句屬道諦攝。	前不可思量等三句屬滅諦攝，次清淨等三句屬道諦攝。	The first three phrases such as inconceivable belong to the truth of cessation, and the next three phrases such as pure belong to the truth of the path.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801b29_1']	初離欲有三句：	初離欲有三句：	The initial detachment has three phrases:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c03_5']	一者云何不可思量於有無等四句，覺觀思量不能通達故、一切眾生言語名句味等不能詮辯故、唯聖人無分別智所證知故，故名不可思量。	一者云何不可思量於有無等四句，覺觀思量不能通達故、一切眾生言語名句味等不能詮辯故、唯聖人無分別智所證知故，故名不可思量。	1) How is it inconceivable? Because it cannot be penetrated by the conceptual thoughts of the four propositions such as existence and non-existence, because it cannot be described by the words, phrases, and sentences of all sentient beings, and because it is realized only by the non-discriminating cognition of the sages, it is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c03_15']	二無二者，如經中說：	二無二者，如經中說：	2) Non-dual means, as stated in the sūtra:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c03_19']	舍利弗！	舍利弗！	Śāriputra!
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c04_11']	諸佛法身無二法、無分別法。	諸佛法身無二法、無分別法。	The Dharma body of all buddhas is devoid of two dharmas and is a dharma of non-discrimination.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c05_5']	所言二者，煩惱及業是名為二。	所言二者，煩惱及業是名為二。	What are called the two are afflictions and karma, which are called the two.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c05_19']	如來法身無此二法，故名無二。	如來法身無此二法，故名無二。	The Dharma body of the Tathāgata is devoid of these two dharmas, and is therefore called non-dual.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c07_7']	三無分別，分別者，煩惱業家習不正思惟，由不正思惟故起二。	三無分別，分別者，煩惱業家習不正思惟，由不正思惟故起二。	The three non-discriminations are discriminations. Afflictions and karma are the habits of improper contemplation. Due to improper contemplation, the two arise.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c08_7']	由通達自性故滅二，是二及分別不應不行。	由通達自性故滅二，是二及分別不應不行。	Due to penetrating the intrinsic nature, the two are extinguished. These two and discrimination should not be non-existent.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c09_2']	不應者，上心煩惱不相應共行；	不應者，上心煩惱不相應共行；	Should not means the upper level afflictions are not associated with common activities;
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c09_15']	不行者，隨眠煩惱不共隨行。	不行者，隨眠煩惱不共隨行。	Non-existent means the latent afflictions do not accompany common activities.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c11_2']	即不應不行此二處故，故說如來法身苦滅究竟永無生起。	即不應不行此二處故，故說如來法身苦滅究竟永無生起。	Because these two places should not be non-existent, it is said that the Dharma body of the Tathāgata is the ultimate cessation of suffering and is forever unarisen.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c11_7']	云何如此？	云何如此？	How is this so?
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c12_8']	非為除滅一法故名為滅，以本來不生故名為滅。	非為除滅一法故名為滅，以本來不生故名為滅。	It is not called cessation because of the cessation of a single dharma, but because it is originally unborn, it is called cessation.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c12_18']	如《無上依經》中說：	如《無上依經》中說：	As the Supremely Dependent Sūtra says:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c12_21']	阿難！	阿難！	Ānanda!
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c13_17']	於無生無滅法中，心意及識決定不生故。	於無生無滅法中，心意及識決定不生故。	Because the mind, thought, and consciousness do not arise in the Dharma of non-arising and non-ceasing.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c14_2']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The explanation says:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c15_12']	心者即六識心，意者阿陀那識，識者阿梨耶識，於此三中不得生故。	心者即六識心，意者阿陀那識，識者阿梨耶識，於此三中不得生故。	The mind refers to the six consciousnesses, the thought refers to the ālaya consciousness, and the consciousness refers to the ālaya consciousness. Because these three do not arise.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c16_16']	此中若無三識則無分別，分別既無亦無不正思惟等。	此中若無三識則無分別，分別既無亦無不正思惟等。	Here, if the three consciousnesses do not exist, then there is no discrimination. Since discrimination does not exist, there is also no incorrect thought, etc.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c18_8']	既無三識則不得起無明，是以如來法身離不正思惟故則不起無明。	既無三識則不得起無明，是以如來法身離不正思惟故則不起無明。	Since there are no three consciousnesses, then ignorance cannot arise. Therefore, the Tathāgata's Dharma body is free from incorrect thought, and thus does not give rise to ignorance.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c19_9']	若不起無明，十二有分不為生緣，故名不生。	若不起無明，十二有分不為生緣，故名不生。	If ignorance does not arise, then the twelve links of dependent arising are not conditions for birth, and thus are called unborn.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c19_17']	又《勝鬘經》說：	又《勝鬘經》說：	Moreover, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c20_8']	是苦滅者，非滅壞法名為苦滅。	是苦滅者，非滅壞法名為苦滅。	This cessation of suffering is not a Dharma of cessation and destruction, and is called the cessation of suffering.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c21_3']	壞者，破三界見諦，得有餘涅槃。	壞者，破三界見諦，得有餘涅槃。	Destruction refers to the destruction of the three realms of views, and attaining nirvāṇa with remainder.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c22_7']	滅者，除四種生死思惟煩惱，得無餘涅槃，故言滅壞。	滅者，除四種生死思惟煩惱，得無餘涅槃，故言滅壞。	Cessation refers to the elimination of the afflictions of thought in the four kinds of birth and death, and attaining nirvāṇa without remainder, and thus is called cessation and destruction.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c25_15']	由苦滅名無始時節非作非生、無滅離盡、常住恒寂、湛然自性清淨、解脫一切煩惱㲉、功德過恒沙數，相攝非相離，不捨離智、不可思惟，與如來法相應。	由苦滅名無始時節非作非生、無滅離盡、常住恒寂、湛然自性清淨、解脫一切煩惱㲉、功德過恒沙數，相攝非相離，不捨離智、不可思惟，與如來法相應。	Because of the cessation of suffering, it is called beginningless, neither created nor produced, without cessation, free from exhaustion, eternally abiding, always tranquil, naturally pure, liberated from all afflictions, with merits surpassing the number of sands in the Ganges River, inseparable from the characteristics, not apart from wisdom, inconceivable, and in accord with the dharmas of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c26_15']	如來法身諸佛所說，是如來法身，說名離欲。	如來法身諸佛所說，是如來法身，說名離欲。	The Dharma body of the Tathāgata is spoken of by all Buddhas. This Dharma body of the Tathāgata is called the detachment.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c27_16']	二離欲因者，為得此法身，見諦道、修道所攝。	二離欲因者，為得此法身，見諦道、修道所攝。	The two causes of detachment are: in order to attain this Dharma body, it is included in the path of seeing the truth and the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c28_12']	由境界故，說無分別智有三義與日相似：	由境界故，說無分別智有三義與日相似：	Due to the object, the non-discriminating cognition is said to have three meanings that are similar to the sun:
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0801c29_5', 'ZH_T31_1610_003:0802a01_1']	無流清淨故，與日輪相似；🔽能照了一切境界故，與日明相似；	無流清淨故，與日輪相似； 能照了一切境界故，與日明相似；	Because it is pure without outflows, it is similar to the sun disk;🔽Because it can illuminate all objects, it is similar to the sun's brightness;
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0802a01_18']	能對治一切真見暗障故，與日光相似。	能對治一切真見暗障故，與日光相似。	Because it can counteract the darkness that obstructs true seeing, it is similar to the sunlight.

['ZH_T31_1610_003:0802a03_3']	真見暗障者，謂具足想、煩惱難、業難、果報難。	真見暗障者，謂具足想、煩惱難、業難、果報難。	The true view is the darkness and obstruction of those who possess the notion of completeness, the difficulty of afflictions, the difficulty of karma, and the difficulty of retribution.
['ZH_T31_1610_003:0802a05_2']	具足想者，以隨眠煩惱為因、五塵欲為緣、不正思惟為俱起因，具此三故，名為具足想。	具足想者，以隨眠煩惱為因、五塵欲為緣、不正思惟為俱起因，具此三故，名為具足想。	Those who possess the notion of completeness take the latent afflictions as the cause, the desire for the five sense objects as the condition, and incorrect thought as the co-arising cause. Because they possess these three, it is called possessing the notion of completeness.

['ZH_T31_1610_003:0802a14_2']	此觀能除真實見暗障，是如來法身至得家因，見修二道所攝故。	此觀能除真實見暗障，是如來法身至得家因，見修二道所攝故。	This observation can eliminate the obstacles of darkness in the view of reality, it is the cause for attaining the family of the Tathāgata's Dharma body, because it is included in the two paths of seeing and cultivation.
