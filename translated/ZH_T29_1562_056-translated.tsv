['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a14_7']	修能對治勝進位中，所斷諸惑為再斷不？	修能對治勝進位中，所斷諸惑為再斷不？	In the stage of advancing cultivation that is the antidote, are the various delusions to be eliminated again or not?
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a14_16']	所得離繫有重得耶？	所得離繫有重得耶？	Is there a repeated attainment of the disjunction [from the delusions]?

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a15_0']	諸惑無再斷，　　離繫有重得，	諸惑無再斷，　　離繫有重得，	The various delusions are not eliminated again, but there is a repeated attainment of disjunction,
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a16_13']	謂治生得果，　　練根六時中。	謂治生得果，　　練根六時中。	That is, in the six situations of producing the antidote, attaining the fruit, and sharpening the faculties.

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a18_19']	所斷諸惑由得自分無間道故便頓永斷，離退後時無再斷義，斷已復斷則為唐捐。	所斷諸惑由得自分無間道故便頓永斷，離退後時無再斷義，斷已復斷則為唐捐。	The various delusions to be eliminated are suddenly and permanently eliminated by attaining the uninterrupted path of one's own stage. After one has retreated, there is no meaning of eliminating them again later. If one eliminates them again after having already eliminated them, it would be useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a22_1']	所得離繫雖無隨道漸勝進理，而道進時容有重起彼勝得理，以離繫得道所攝故，捨得道時彼亦捨得，故諸離繫有重得理此依容有。	所得離繫雖無隨道漸勝進理，而道進時容有重起彼勝得理，以離繫得道所攝故，捨得道時彼亦捨得，故諸離繫有重得理此依容有。	Although there is no principle of gradual progress in the bonds that are eliminated, there is a principle of repeated production of the superior acquisition of these bonds when the path progresses, because the bonds that are eliminated are included in the path. When one abandons the path, one also abandons the acquisition of the bonds. Therefore there is a principle of repeated acquisition of the bonds. This is based on the possibility of such a principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a22_17']	時總有六，謂治道起、得果、練根。	時總有六，謂治道起、得果、練根。	There are six times when one acquires the previously unacquired path, namely, when the antidote arises, when one acquires a fruit, and when one sharpens one's faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a23_18']	說治生言通目二義，若據住此能證離繫，目無間道；	說治生言通目二義，若據住此能證離繫，目無間道；	The words when the antidote arises generally refer to two meanings. If one abides in this antidote, one is able to realize the bonds that are eliminated, and this refers to the uninterrupted path.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a24_12']	若據住此正證離繫，目解脫道。	若據住此正證離繫，目解脫道。	If one abides in this antidote, one realizes the bonds that are eliminated, and this refers to the path of liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a25_13']	言得果者，謂得預流、一來、不還、阿羅漢果。	言得果者，謂得預流、一來、不還、阿羅漢果。	Acquiring a fruit means acquiring the fruits of stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arhatship.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a26_1']	言練根者，謂增進根。	言練根者，謂增進根。	Sharpening one's faculties means progressing in one's faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a26_19']	由此六時得未曾道，有捨曾道得離繫故。	由此六時得未曾道，有捨曾道得離繫故。	Because of these six times, one acquires the previously unacquired path, because one abandons the previously acquired path and acquires the bonds that are eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a28_16']	說得果言既無差別，如攝四果應攝練根，以轉根時必得果故，何勞長說此練根言？	說得果言既無差別，如攝四果應攝練根，以轉根時必得果故，何勞長說此練根言？	Since the words “attaining a fruit” are not distinguished, the four fruits should be included in the words “purifying the faculties,” because one necessarily attains a fruit when one transforms faculties. Why bother with the lengthy expression “purifying the faculties?”
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652a29_17']	為顯練根異斷惑得果故，得果外說練根無失。	為顯練根異斷惑得果故，得果外說練根無失。	In order to show that the purification of the faculties is different from the elimination of the passions and the attainment of a fruit, there is no error in speaking of the purification of the faculties apart from the attainment of a fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b01_16']	然得離繫，隨其所應有具六時乃至唯二。	然得離繫，隨其所應有具六時乃至唯二。	However, the acquisition of separation from the bonds is complete in six times up to only two times, as is appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b03_5']	謂欲界繫見四諦斷，及色無色見三諦斷，所得離繫得具六時。	謂欲界繫見四諦斷，及色無色見三諦斷，所得離繫得具六時。	That is, the acquisition of separation from the bonds that is eliminated by insight into the four truths in the realm of desire and that which is eliminated by insight into the three truths in the realms of form and of formlessness is complete in six times.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b05_3']	色無色界見道諦斷，所得離繫得唯五時，由治生時即得果故，說得果已不說治生。	色無色界見道諦斷，所得離繫得唯五時，由治生時即得果故，說得果已不說治生。	The acquisition of separation from the bonds that is eliminated by insight into the truth of the path in the realms of form and of formlessness is complete in five times, because when the antidote is produced, one attains a fruit. Therefore, having spoken of the attainment of a fruit, one does not speak of the production of the antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b06_2']	欲界修斷五品離繫，亦五時得，除預流果。	欲界修斷五品離繫，亦五時得，除預流果。	The five grades of separation from the bonds that are eliminated by cultivation in the realm of desire are also attained in five times, excluding the fruit of streamenterer.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b07_1']	第六離繫得唯四時，得果、治生時無別故。	第六離繫得唯四時，得果、治生時無別故。	The sixth separation from the bonds is attained in only four times, because there is no distinction between the time of attaining a fruit and the time of producing an antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b07_19']	第七八品亦唯四時，得果四中除前二故。	第七八品亦唯四時，得果四中除前二故。	The eighth and ninth stages also have only four times, because the first two of the four times of obtaining fruits are excluded.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b08_17']	第九離繫得唯三時，亦治生時即得果故。	第九離繫得唯三時，亦治生時即得果故。	The ninth separation from bonds has only three times, because the time of obtaining the fruit is the same as the time of producing the antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b10_15']	色無色界修所斷中，唯除有頂第九離繫，所餘離繫亦唯三時，得果四中除前三故。	色無色界修所斷中，唯除有頂第九離繫，所餘離繫亦唯三時，得果四中除前三故。	In the realm of form and the formless realm, with the exception of the ninth separation from bonds of the peak of existence, the remaining separations from bonds also have only three times, because the first three of the four times of obtaining the fruit are excluded.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b11_15']	有頂第九得唯二時，得果、治生同一時故。	有頂第九得唯二時，得果、治生同一時故。	The ninth of the peak of existence has only two times, because the time of obtaining the fruit is the same as the time of producing the antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b13_15']	此約鈍說，若就利根，前諸位中除練根得，豈不八地容世俗道，斷應分二種，對治生時得？	此約鈍說，若就利根，前諸位中除練根得，豈不八地容世俗道，斷應分二種，對治生時得？	This is said with reference to the dull faculties. If we refer to the sharp faculties, in the previous stages, the attainment of the sharp faculties is excluded. Are the bonds of the eight stages not divided into two kinds, according to whether the antidote is produced or not, when the mundane path is possible?
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b14_13']	不爾，此說漸次得故，惑此唯約無漏得故。	不爾，此說漸次得故，惑此唯約無漏得故。	No, because this is said with reference to gradual attainment, and because the bonds are only discussed in terms of the attainment of the pure path.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b17_11', 'ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b19_16', 'ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b20_16', 'ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b22_4']	若依越次通有漏得，則世俗道八地染中，隨離少多入聖道者彼得離繫，隨其所應有具六時，乃至唯一，以利根故，除練根時。🔽謂欲界中先斷五品入見諦者，彼見所斷五品離繫具六時得，謂有二種自治生時，及得果時復四成六。🔽彼修所斷五品離繫，唯五時得，除預流果。🔽先斷六品入見諦者，彼見所斷六品離繫，亦五時得，除一如前。	若依越次通有漏得，則世俗道八地染中，隨離少多入聖道者彼得離繫，隨其所應有具六時，乃至唯一，以利根故，除練根時。 謂欲界中先斷五品入見諦者，彼見所斷五品離繫具六時得，謂有二種自治生時，及得果時復四成六。 彼修所斷五品離繫，唯五時得，除預流果。 先斷六品入見諦者，彼見所斷六品離繫，亦五時得，除一如前。	If we discuss the matter in terms of the order of the stages, then, in the case of the defiled dharmas of the eight stages of the realm of desire and the realm of form, when one enters the holy path by abandoning a few or many of the passions, he obtains freedom from the bonds. He possesses the six times in accordance with his circumstances, and there is only one time, because he is of sharp faculties. The time of the perfecting of faculties is excluded.🔽That is, in the realm of desire, one who has previously abandoned the first five classes of the impure enters into the path of insight. He possesses the six times in regard to the bonds that are to be severed by the path of insight. There are two kinds of times of the arising of the selfsame antidote, and there are four times of the acquisition of the fruit, making six in all.🔽In regard to the bonds that are to be severed by the path of cultivation, he possesses only five times, excluding the fruit of stream-winner.🔽One who has previously abandoned the first six classes of the impure enters into the path of insight. He possesses five times in regard to the bonds that are to be severed by the path of insight, excluding one time as before.🔽🔽
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b24_2']	彼修所斷六品離繫，唯世俗道治生時得，必不起彼無漏對治，是一來果向道攝故。	彼修所斷六品離繫，唯世俗道治生時得，必不起彼無漏對治，是一來果向道攝故。	If we discuss the matter in terms of the path of cultivation, then the path of cultivation of the two vehicles is able to eliminate the passions of the nine stages. The bodhisattva and the Buddha are able to eliminate the passions of the nine stages by means of the path of cultivation. The bodhisattva and the Buddha are able to eliminate the passions of the nine stages by means of the path of cultivation.

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b25_1']	非住果時起彼向道，以住勝果不起劣故。	非住果時起彼向道，以住勝果不起劣故。	One does not generate the path of progress while abiding in the fruit, because one does not generate inferior dharmas while abiding in superior fruits.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b26_9']	先斷八品入見諦者，彼見所斷八品離繫，亦五時得，除一如前。	先斷八品入見諦者，彼見所斷八品離繫，亦五時得，除一如前。	Those who have previously eliminated the first eight classes of passions and then enter the path of insight have five times for obtaining the bonds of the class of passions that are eliminated by the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652b27_8']	彼修所斷前六離繫，唯一時得，如前應知。	彼修所斷前六離繫，唯一時得，如前應知。	Those who have previously eliminated the first six classes of the passions to be eliminated by the path of cultivation have one time for obtaining the bonds of the first six classes of passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation.

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c02_8']	依根本地入見諦者，彼見所斷九品離繫亦一時得，如前應知。	依根本地入見諦者，彼見所斷九品離繫亦一時得，如前應知。	Those who have previously eliminated the first nine classes of passions and then enter the path of insight by relying on the fundamental stage of the realm of form have one time for obtaining the bonds of the first nine classes of passions that are eliminated by the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c05_4']	根本非欲斷對治故，若依未至、若依根本，彼修所斷九品離繫亦一時得，如前應知，必不起彼無漏對治，是不還果向道攝故。	根本非欲斷對治故，若依未至、若依根本，彼修所斷九品離繫亦一時得，如前應知，必不起彼無漏對治，是不還果向道攝故。	Because the fundamental ground is not the antidote for the elimination of desire. If one relies on the preliminary stage or the fundamental ground, the nine grades of bonds to be eliminated by cultivation are also obtained at one time. As before, one should know that one definitely does not give rise to the impure antidote, because it is included in the path of the non-returner fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c06_14']	先斷上七地入見諦者，彼見三諦斷七地離繫亦四時得，如前應知。	先斷上七地入見諦者，彼見三諦斷七地離繫亦四時得，如前應知。	Those who first eliminate the upper seven grounds and enter the truth of the path, their bonds to be eliminated by the three truths of the seven grounds are also obtained at four times, as should be known as before.

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c09_11']	彼修所斷七地離繫，唯三時得，謂二治生及一得果。	彼修所斷七地離繫，唯三時得，謂二治生及一得果。	The bonds to be eliminated by cultivation of the seven grounds are only obtained at three times, namely, when the two antidotes are produced and when the one fruit is obtained.

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c12_7']	見道諦斷離繫，二時，由治生時即得果故。	見道諦斷離繫，二時，由治生時即得果故。	The bonds to be eliminated by the path of insight are eliminated in two moments, because one obtains the fruit when the antidote is produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c13_6']	修斷八品離繫，二時，謂一治生及一得果。	修斷八品離繫，二時，謂一治生及一得果。	The bonds of the eight categories to be eliminated by cultivation are eliminated in two moments, that is, one when the antidote is produced and one when the fruit is obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c14_5']	第九離繫唯一時得，以治生時即得果故。	第九離繫唯一時得，以治生時即得果故。	The bonds of the ninth category are eliminated in one moment, because when the antidote is produced, one obtains the fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c15_4']	諸分離染見修位中進斷所餘，准此應說。	諸分離染見修位中進斷所餘，准此應說。	Those who are free from the bonds of the various stages of the path of insight and the path of cultivation and eliminate the remaining bonds should be discussed in accordance with this principle.

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c18_10']	應如是知，應如是見彼從欲漏心得解脫，乃至廣說。	應如是知，應如是見彼從欲漏心得解脫，乃至廣說。	Because of the teachings of the scriptures. A scripture says, in regard to the correct realization and attainment of the fruit of arhatship, It should be known and seen that he is liberated from the mind of the asravas of desire, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c20_1']	由此位中亦得欲界厭患對治等無學法智故，知彼離繫亦應重得。	由此位中亦得欲界厭患對治等無學法智故，知彼離繫亦應重得。	Because in this stage one also obtains the knowledge of dharmas and the knowledge of subsequent states that are counteragents to disgust with the realm of desire, etc., and are unlearnable, we know that one again obtains the bonds that were previously eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c21_19']	前言斷欲六品九品入見諦者，彼先修斷六九離繫，無無漏得，為永不得、暫不得耶？	前言斷欲六品九品入見諦者，彼先修斷六九離繫，無無漏得，為永不得、暫不得耶？	As for the above statement that one who has eliminated six or nine classes of passions enters the path of insight, the bonds of the six or nine classes that one has previously eliminated through cultivation are not the possession of pure disconnection. Does this mean that one never obtains them or that one temporarily does not obtain them?
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c22_7']	應決定言彼永不得。	應決定言彼永不得。	You must definitely say that one never obtains them.

['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c25_5']	若彼先時所斷離繫有無漏得今時捨者，於彼今應得無漏得；	若彼先時所斷離繫有無漏得今時捨者，於彼今應得無漏得；	If one loses the pure possession of the bonds eliminated previously, one should now acquire pure possession of them.

When one acquires the bonds of disconnection, only the antidote that is cultivated arises, and when one acquires a superior path, one loses the inferior one.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c28_2']	諸有先依根本靜慮入見諦者，得無學時，寧從欲漏心得解脫？	諸有先依根本靜慮入見諦者，得無學時，寧從欲漏心得解脫？	When one who previously relied on the fundamental meditations to enter the path of insight realizes the state of arhat, how can he be said to be liberated from the mind of the impurity of desire?
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0652c29_1']	就依未至入見諦者及次第者，說故無失。	就依未至入見諦者及次第者，說故無失。	There is no error in this statement, because it is made with reference to one who enters the path of insight relying on the preliminary stage of meditation and to one who enters it in the regular order.

It is on the basis of this that it is said that one is liberated from the mind that is the asava of desire.
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0653a03_6']	由此即釋契經所言：	由此即釋契經所言：	On the basis of this, we explain the meaning of the following passage from the scriptures:
['ZH_T29_1562_056:0653a03_15']	阿羅漢果永斷瞋恚。	阿羅漢果永斷瞋恚。	The fruit of arhatship is the eternal abandonment of hatred.
