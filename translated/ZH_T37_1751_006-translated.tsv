['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b05_13']	彼云無邊既稱尊特，此何獨非？	彼云無邊既稱尊特，此何獨非？	Since the boundless in that text is called the superior body, why is this not so?

['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b09_3']	何故《法華疏》中判觀無量壽佛經云「實有量而言無量」？	何故《法華疏》中判觀無量壽佛經云「實有量而言無量」？	Why does the Fahua Shu classify the Guan Wuliangshou Fo Jing as actually having a measure but speaking of immeasurable?
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b09_5']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b09_18']	此乃《刊正鈔》中錯引彼疏。	此乃《刊正鈔》中錯引彼疏。	This is a mistake in the Kanzheng Chuo in citing that commentary.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b11_2']	彼疏並云「實有量而言無量，如《阿彌陀》與《金光疏》及此疏同。	彼疏並云「實有量而言無量，如《阿彌陀》與《金光疏》及此疏同。	That commentary all says actually having a measure but speaking of immeasurable, like the Amituo and the Jin Guang Shu, and this commentary are the same.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b12_14']	」蓋以小大二彌陀經不專尊特被於頓機，故彼佛現三十二相通被眾機。	」蓋以小大二彌陀經不專尊特被於頓機，故彼佛現三十二相通被眾機。	It is because the two Amituo sutras in small and large are not exclusive to the honored and special, and are for the sudden teaching, so that Buddha manifests the thirty-two marks and is universally for the various teachings.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b15_8']	大機雖見尊特常身，其慣習小人洎諸凡夫，雖因迴向得生彼土，未宜尊特說常住理，故以應化說無常法，成其小果。	大機雖見尊特常身，其慣習小人洎諸凡夫，雖因迴向得生彼土，未宜尊特說常住理，故以應化說無常法，成其小果。	Although the great teaching sees the honored and special eternal body, its habitual small people and all ordinary beings, although they attain rebirth in that land by means of turning towards, are not yet suitable for the honored and special teaching of the principle of eternal abiding, so they use the responsive transformation to speak of the impermanent teaching, and accomplish their small fruits.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b16_2']	是故佛壽雖不可數，終歸有量。	是故佛壽雖不可數，終歸有量。	Therefore, although the Buddha's life span cannot be counted, it will eventually have a measure.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b17_2']	娑婆生彼多是此機，以別圓似位人難及故。	娑婆生彼多是此機，以別圓似位人難及故。	Those born in the Saha world are mostly of this teaching, because it is difficult for those in the stages of similarity in the distinct and perfect teachings to reach.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b17_16']	三疏約此，故判彌陀在有量中。	三疏約此，故判彌陀在有量中。	The three commentaries judge Amitabha to be within the limited, based on this.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b18_18']	若《觀無量壽佛經》純被圓人，明說佛身全法界起。	若《觀無量壽佛經》純被圓人，明說佛身全法界起。	If the Sutra on Contemplating the Buddha of Immeasurable Life is exclusively for those of the Perfect Teaching, it clearly explains that the Buddha's body arises entirely from the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b20_7']	應既有本，生即同法，的類《釋論》法性尊特，正當無量之無量也。	應既有本，生即同法，的類《釋論》法性尊特，正當無量之無量也。	Since the response body already has the fundamental, birth is the same as the Dharma, specifically corresponding to the Dharma-nature and majestic body of the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom, which is precisely the immeasurable of the immeasurable.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b21_8']	故《釋籤》云「教分二身，為機劣故，暫現生身」。	故《釋籤》云「教分二身，為機劣故，暫現生身」。	Therefore, the Shijiao lun says, The teachings divide the two bodies, because the capacities are inferior, temporarily manifesting the birth body.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b21_18']	今機不劣，豈對生身？	今機不劣，豈對生身？	Now the capacities are not inferior, how could it be the birth body?

['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b22_16']	《大本》中云「生我國者身皆具足三十二相」。	《大本》中云「生我國者身皆具足三十二相」。	The Sutra of Immeasurable Life says, Those born in my land all possess the thirty-two marks.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b24_4']	彼國人民既具此相，佛身理合超勝於人，故知常身有八萬相。	彼國人民既具此相，佛身理合超勝於人，故知常身有八萬相。	Since the people of that land already possess these marks, the Buddha's body should surpass that of humans. Therefore, we know that the eternal body has eighty-four thousand marks.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b25_5']	《般舟經》云「三十二相」，蓋借釋迦為初心觀境耳。	《般舟經》云「三十二相」，蓋借釋迦為初心觀境耳。	The Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sutra says thirty-two marks, which is merely borrowing Śākyamuni as the realm of contemplation for beginners.

['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b26_8']	《般舟經》云「菩薩用是念佛，故當得生阿彌陀佛國。	《般舟經》云「菩薩用是念佛，故當得生阿彌陀佛國。	The Panhou Jing says, The bodhisattva uses this mindfulness of the Buddha to be reborn in Amitâbha Buddha's land.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b28_4']	當念如是佛身，有三十二相悉具足，光明徹照端正無比，在比丘僧中說經」。	當念如是佛身，有三十二相悉具足，光明徹照端正無比，在比丘僧中說經」。	One should contemplate the Buddha's body thus, with the thirty-two marks all complete, the light penetrating and illuminating, upright and incomparably correct, expounding the sutras among the assembly of bhikṣus.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226b29_3']	經指彌陀有三十二相，何文言借釋迦為境？	經指彌陀有三十二相，何文言借釋迦為境？	The sutra refers to Amitâbha having the thirty-two marks. What text says to borrow Śākyamuni as the object of contemplation?
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c01_3']	況《止觀》無文、《輔行》不說，豈得自言成於己見？	況《止觀》無文、《輔行》不說，豈得自言成於己見？	Moreover, the Zhizhe Guan does not have this text, and the Fuxing does not discuss it. How can one claim to have achieved one's own understanding by oneself?
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c02_7']	又彼人民三十二相，故佛常相須八萬者，其義不然。	又彼人民三十二相，故佛常相須八萬者，其義不然。	Furthermore, the people there have the thirty-two marks, so the Buddha's constant marks must be eighty thousand. This meaning is not so.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c04_8']	以同居土佛應同人，只淨由土人皆有於三十二相，故佛常身須現此相，但於同中相相皆勝。	以同居土佛應同人，只淨由土人皆有於三十二相，故佛常身須現此相，但於同中相相皆勝。	Because in the land of shared enjoyment, the Buddha's response to people is only due to the land. Since the people all have the thirty-two marks, the Buddha's constant body must manifest these marks. But within the shared, each mark is superior.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c06_11']	穢土佛身雖異凡鄙，亦同上人，故應此方所有相法，故三十二同輪王相，亦於同中而分明昧。	穢土佛身雖異凡鄙，亦同上人，故應此方所有相法，故三十二同輪王相，亦於同中而分明昧。	Although the Buddha's body in the defiled land is different from ordinary people, it is also like the superior person, so it should correspond to the characteristics of this world. Therefore, the thirty-two marks are the same as the marks of the wheel-turning king, and they are also clear and obscure within the same.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c07_10']	三十二相既同彼人，驗是彼土常身常相。	三十二相既同彼人，驗是彼土常身常相。	Since the thirty-two marks are the same as those of that person, it is verified that this is the eternal body and eternal marks of that land.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c08_9']	是知八萬別為大機現尊特相，更何所疑？	是知八萬別為大機現尊特相，更何所疑？	Know that the eighty minor marks are specifically manifested for the great capacity, showing the superior and special marks. What else is there to doubt?

['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c09_4']	一等尊特，以何因緣相分三品？	一等尊特，以何因緣相分三品？	For the same superior and special marks, what causes and conditions divide the marks into three grades?
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c09_6']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c09_12']	悉檀因緣故。	悉檀因緣故。	It is due to the causes and conditions of the siddhānta.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c10_18']	蓋一類機應以藏塵尊特之相得四益者，故佛稱機而為現之。	蓋一類機應以藏塵尊特之相得四益者，故佛稱機而為現之。	It is because there are some capacities that should attain the four benefits through the marks of the hidden dust superior and special body, so the Buddha responds to those capacities and manifests it for them.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c12_13']	應以八萬尊特之相、應以三十二尊特之相得四益者，佛皆稱機而為現之。	應以八萬尊特之相、應以三十二尊特之相得四益者，佛皆稱機而為現之。	There are those that should attain the four benefits through the marks of the eighty minor marks superior and special body, and those that should attain the four benefits through the marks of the thirty-two major marks superior and special body, the Buddha all responds to those capacities and manifests it for them.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c14_9']	仍須了知此之相海，別教則用別修緣了成就此相，即修成之尊特，故名報身。	仍須了知此之相海，別教則用別修緣了成就此相，即修成之尊特，故名報身。	It should also be known that this ocean of characteristics, in the Distinct Teaching, uses distinct cultivation of conditions and wisdom to accomplish these characteristics, which are then the honored and special body cultivated and perfected, and is therefore called the reward body.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c15_15']	圓教能了二修即性修德無功，乃性具之尊特，故名法身。	圓教能了二修即性修德無功，乃性具之尊特，故名法身。	In the Perfect Teaching, one is able to understand that the two cultivations are identical to the nature, and the cultivation of virtue is effortless. This is the honored and special body endowed in the nature, and is therefore called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c16_4']	已在此觀開章中說。	已在此觀開章中說。	This has already been explained in the chapter on opening the topic in this contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c17_8']	須知《華嚴》華藏塵數之相雖多，此以兼別故猶帶修成。	須知《華嚴》華藏塵數之相雖多，此以兼別故猶帶修成。	It should be known that although the characteristics of the ocean of the Dharma realm in the Flower Ornament Sutra are numerous, this is because it also includes the Distinct Teaching, and so it still involves cultivation and perfection.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c18_18']	此論八萬既唯圓頓無非性具，故三聖觀疏皆示云「觀於法身」。	此論八萬既唯圓頓無非性具，故三聖觀疏皆示云「觀於法身」。	This treatise on the eighty minor marks is exclusively the Perfect and Sudden, and none of them are not endowed in the nature, and so the commentaries on the contemplations of the three sages all show that one contemplates the Dharma body.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c20_10']	行者當須以教定理、就理明觀、於觀顯相，無得但以多數斥少、使勝成劣。	行者當須以教定理、就理明觀、於觀顯相，無得但以多數斥少、使勝成劣。	Practitioners must use the teachings to determine the principles, use the principles to clarify the contemplations, and manifest the characteristics in the contemplations. One should not just use the many numbers to criticize the few, and make the superior become inferior.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c21_8']	實在精學然後勤修，欲罷不能故茲辯析。	實在精學然後勤修，欲罷不能故茲辯析。	It is truly necessary to study carefully and then diligently cultivate, wanting to stop but being unable to do so, and so this analysis is made.

['ZH_T37_1751_006:0226c29_18']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0227a01_12']	淨土勝應，不可以穢土劣應例也。	淨土勝應，不可以穢土劣應例也。	The superior manifestation in the Pure Land cannot be compared to the inferior manifestation in the defiled land.

If it were not for good from samādhi, how could they reach this? Therefore, the Treatise on Resolving Ten Doubts about the Pure Land says, Those who meet a good friend at the end of their life and accomplish the ten recitations are all those with strong wholesome karma from past lives who have just met a spiritual friend.

['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229a12_4']	故上上品善通下下品，下下品惡通上上品。	故上上品善通下下品，下下品惡通上上品。	Thus, the highest of the highest grade of wholesome deeds includes the lowest of the lowest grade, and the lowest of the lowest grade of unwholesome deeds includes the highest of the highest grade.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229a14_1']	三心六念或聞或修，未能伏惑屬下三品，以此伏惑入中三品，能破二惑方預上三。	三心六念或聞或修，未能伏惑屬下三品，以此伏惑入中三品，能破二惑方預上三。	The three minds and six recollections, whether heard or practiced, are unable to subdue afflictions and belong to the lower three grades. Using them to subdue afflictions enters the middle three grades, and only being able to break through the two afflictions barely qualifies for the upper three grades.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229a14_20']	如五逆罪，臨終十念為能消功，屬下下品。	如五逆罪，臨終十念為能消功，屬下下品。	For example, the five heinous crimes, if repented at the time of death with ten recitations, can be eliminated and belong to the lowest of the lowest grade.

Therefore, the Tathāgata devised a different expedient, first contemplating the setting sun in the west to stabilize the mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229b08_16']	疏云「除五逆罪，下輩自論」，故知妙觀想落日成，當下下品。	疏云「除五逆罪，下輩自論」，故知妙觀想落日成，當下下品。	The commentary says, Excluding the crimes of the five heinous acts, the lower grades discuss themselves, so we know that when the wonderful contemplation of the setting sun is accomplished, it corresponds to the lower grade of the lower grade.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229b09_9']	次以三觀想水結氷，合在下中。	次以三觀想水結氷，合在下中。	Next, using the three contemplations to contemplate the water freezing into ice, it is combined in the middle and lower grade.

It is not yet possible to immediately contemplate the wondrous physical characteristics, so one cultivates the three contemplations to contemplate the jeweled image. When the image appears, the views and delusions are completely eliminated.

['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229b19_18']	事識既盡，全依業識可觀三聖真法之身，及普觀成，在八九信，即上中品，故難思相、法界光明、十方佛事悉能洞見。	事識既盡，全依業識可觀三聖真法之身，及普觀成，在八九信，即上中品，故難思相、法界光明、十方佛事悉能洞見。	When the discriminating consciousness is exhausted, one completely relies on the karmic consciousness to contemplate the true Dharma body of the three sages, and when the universal contemplation is accomplished, it is in the eighth and ninth stages of faith, which is the middle and upper grades, so one is able to clearly see the inconceivable characteristics, the light of the Dharma realm, and the activities of the buddhas in the ten directions.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229b22_9']	後修雜觀及三輩觀成，當第十信，即上上品，內外塵沙任運除盡，故隨機應相，及差別行業觀察明了、宣示無窮。	後修雜觀及三輩觀成，當第十信，即上上品，內外塵沙任運除盡，故隨機應相，及差別行業觀察明了、宣示無窮。	Later, when the miscellaneous contemplations and the three grades of contemplations are accomplished, it is the tenth stage of faith, which is the upper and upper grades. The internal and external dust-like [delusions] are naturally eliminated, so one responds to the characteristics according to one's capacity, and the various types of karmic activities are clearly observed and explained endlessly.

This is said from the perspective of gradually changing the contemplation and entering the grades in sequence.

This is from the stage of name and form to the accomplishment of contemplation, entering the stage of similarity and going through the nine grades.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229c04_14']	然十六中佛境最宜，從劣觀勝成於九品，故疏令觀釋迦毫相，以為初心入門之漸。	然十六中佛境最宜，從劣觀勝成於九品，故疏令觀釋迦毫相，以為初心入門之漸。	However, among the sixteen, the Buddha's realm is the most suitable. Observing from the inferior to the superior, it becomes the nine grades. Therefore, the commentary instructs to contemplate Śākyamuni's tuft of white hair as the initial step for entering the door.
['ZH_T37_1751_006:0229c05_18']	雜觀令觀一丈六像，經雖不云從一相入，據理合然。	雜觀令觀一丈六像，經雖不云從一相入，據理合然。	The miscellaneous contemplation instructs to contemplate a twelve-foot image. Although the sūtra does not say to enter from a single characteristic, according to principle it should be so.
