['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268a29_17']	普為饒益一切有情，正發無上菩提大願。	普為饒益一切有情，正發無上菩提大願。	Universally for the benefit of all sentient beings, correctly giving rise to the great vow of unsurpassed enlightenment.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b03_19']	等觀世間，常為種種不正尋伺紛擾暴風亂心相續，邪見羂網之所羂網，生死樊籠之所樊籠，無量憂苦毒箭所射，諸有所行皆離明慧。	等觀世間，常為種種不正尋伺紛擾暴風亂心相續，邪見羂網之所羂網，生死樊籠之所樊籠，無量憂苦毒箭所射，諸有所行皆離明慧。	Equally observing the world, always disturbed by various kinds of improper discursive thoughts, the violent wind of a disturbed mind, the net of the snare of wrong views, the cage of birth and death, shot by the poisoned arrows of immeasurable sorrow and suffering, all activities are devoid of wisdom.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b09_3']	故我依止如淨虛空、絕諸戲論、寂靜安樂、勝義諦理，悲願纏心，不忍見彼眾苦所集，為欲解脫自他相續煩惱固縛、住無退壞，踰於金剛堅固輪圍增上意樂，誓處無邊生死大海，不憚其中所受無量眾苦災橫，發金剛喻不壞精進。	故我依止如淨虛空、絕諸戲論、寂靜安樂、勝義諦理，悲願纏心，不忍見彼眾苦所集，為欲解脫自他相續煩惱固縛、住無退壞，踰於金剛堅固輪圍增上意樂，誓處無邊生死大海，不憚其中所受無量眾苦災橫，發金剛喻不壞精進。	Therefore, I rely on the principle of ultimate truth, which is like pure space, free from all conceptual proliferation, tranquil, peaceful, and blissful. With a mind bound by compassion and vows, I cannot bear to see the mass of suffering of sentient beings. In order to liberate myself and others from the firm bonds of afflictions, to abide without regression or destruction, with a superior intention surpassing even the firm adamantine outer rim, I vow to dwell in the boundless ocean of cyclic existence, not shrinking from the immeasurable suffering and misfortune I will endure within it, and arouse indestructible effort likened to a vajra.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b13_12']	為正開覺如是觀察，要證出世無分別智，方能正知先所未了一切有情聚根勝解、界行差別，及能破裂自他相續所起一切有習無習眾苦根本煩惱羅網，亦能為他起真誓願，堅固受持大士戒行。	為正開覺如是觀察，要證出世無分別智，方能正知先所未了一切有情聚根勝解、界行差別，及能破裂自他相續所起一切有習無習眾苦根本煩惱羅網，亦能為他起真誓願，堅固受持大士戒行。	In order to truly awaken to this kind of observation, one must realize the supramundane non-discriminating cognition, only then can one correctly understand the distinctions in the faculties, inclinations, and realms of practice of all sentient beings that were previously unknown, and can break through the net of afflictions that are the root of all suffering with habitual tendencies and without habitual tendencies that arise in one's own and others' continuums. One can also truly make vows for others and firmly uphold the precepts and practices of a great being.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b15_5']	然證出世無分別智，要須積習能壞一切邪見眼瞙無倒觀空安膳那藥。	然證出世無分別智，要須積習能壞一切邪見眼瞙無倒觀空安膳那藥。	However, to realize supramundane non-discriminating cognition, one must accumulate the practice that can destroy all views of wrong views, the unmistaken observation of emptiness, the medicine of aśana.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b16_12']	如是積習無倒觀空安膳那藥，要藉能遣一切所緣自性聞慧。	如是積習無倒觀空安膳那藥，要藉能遣一切所緣自性聞慧。	In this way, accumulating the practice of unmistaken observation of emptiness, the medicine of aśana, one must rely on the wisdom of hearing that can eliminate the nature of all objects.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b18_2']	由是或有依廣文義正決擇門，已入法性數復勤修勝進加行。	由是或有依廣文義正決擇門，已入法性數復勤修勝進加行。	Therefore, some rely on the gate of correct discernment based on extensive texts and meanings, and having already entered the nature of dharmas, they diligently cultivate superior practices.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b19_1']	於廣文義決擇現前，甚大劬勞心生懈倦。	於廣文義決擇現前，甚大劬勞心生懈倦。	In the presence of the discernment of extensive texts and meanings, the mind becomes weary from great exertion.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b20_18']	或有雖復未入法性而是利根，為欲令彼易證真空速入法性故，略製此《掌珍論》。	或有雖復未入法性而是利根，為欲令彼易證真空速入法性故，略製此《掌珍論》。	Some, although not yet having entered the nature of dharmas, are of sharp faculties. In order to enable them to easily realize true emptiness and quickly enter the nature of dharmas, this Treatise on the Palm Treasury was composed in brief.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b21_13']	真性有為空，　　如幻緣生故；	真性有為空，　　如幻緣生故；	The true nature of conditioned phenomena is empty, like illusory dependent origination;
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b22_13']	無為無有實，　　不起似空華。	無為無有實，　　不起似空華。	Unconditioned phenomena have no reality, they do not arise like sky-flowers.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b24_7']	於自他宗計度差別，雖有眾多遍計所執，然所知境略有二種：	於自他宗計度差別，雖有眾多遍計所執，然所知境略有二種：	Although there are many imagined differences in the views of one's own and others' schools, there are roughly two kinds of objects of knowledge:
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b24_17']	一者有為、二者無為。	一者有為、二者無為。	First, the conditioned, and second, the unconditioned.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268b26_19']	以諸愚夫不正覺了勝義諦理有為無為無顛倒性，妄執諸法自性差別，增益種種邪見羂網。	以諸愚夫不正覺了勝義諦理有為無為無顛倒性，妄執諸法自性差別，增益種種邪見羂網。	Because foolish people do not correctly understand the non-erroneous nature of the conditioned and unconditioned in the ultimate truth, they mistakenly grasp the self-nature and distinctions of dharmas, and increase the various nets of wrong views.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c01_5']	如世有一無智畫師，畫作可畏藥叉鬼像或女人像，眩目亂意謂為實有，執實有故自起驚怖或生貪染，於彼境界眾多計度，增長分別諸見羂網。	如世有一無智畫師，畫作可畏藥叉鬼像或女人像，眩目亂意謂為實有，執實有故自起驚怖或生貪染，於彼境界眾多計度，增長分別諸見羂網。	It is like a painter in the world who, without wisdom, paints a frightening yakṣa ghost or a woman, and with dizzying intent regards it as truly existent. Because of grasping at true existence, he himself becomes frightened or gives rise to desire and attachment. He makes many judgments about that object and increases the nets of various views.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c04_11']	若正覺知勝義諦理有為無為無顛倒性，爾時如世有智畫師，不執彼有真實自性，非如前說有為無為境界差別邪見羂網，以自纏裹如蠶處繭。	若正覺知勝義諦理有為無為無顛倒性，爾時如世有智畫師，不執彼有真實自性，非如前說有為無為境界差別邪見羂網，以自纏裹如蠶處繭。	If one correctly understands the non-erroneous nature of the conditioned and unconditioned in the ultimate truth, then it is like a wise painter in the world who does not grasp at their true self-nature. Unlike the previously mentioned nets of wrong views regarding the distinctions of conditioned and unconditioned objects, he does not wrap himself up like a silkworm in a cocoon.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c05_5']	彼非有故，無分別慧趣入行成。	彼非有故，無分別慧趣入行成。	Because they do not exist, the wisdom of non-discrimination enters and is accomplished.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c06_9']	為顯斯義，先辯有為。	為顯斯義，先辯有為。	In order to reveal this meaning, first we explain the conditioned.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c07_8']	以諸世間於此境上多起分別，故說是言：	以諸世間於此境上多起分別，故說是言：	Because in regard to this object, the world often gives rise to discrimination, therefore we say:
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c07_20']	真性有為空，如幻緣生故。	真性有為空，如幻緣生故。	The true nature of the conditioned is empty, because it arises from illusory conditions.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c09_11']	此中世間同許有者，自亦許為世俗有故世俗現量生起因緣亦許有故。	此中世間同許有者，自亦許為世俗有故世俗現量生起因緣亦許有故。	Here, that which is accepted as existing by the world, we also accept as conventionally existing, because the causes and conditions that give rise to conventional direct perception are also accepted as existing.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c11_1']	眼等有為世俗諦攝，牧牛人等皆共了知，眼等有為是實有故。	眼等有為世俗諦攝，牧牛人等皆共了知，眼等有為是實有故。	The conditioned such as the eye, which is included in the conventional truth, is understood by all, including cowherds and so forth, because the conditioned such as the eye truly exists.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c12_4']	勿違如是自宗所許、現量共知，故以真性簡別立宗。	勿違如是自宗所許、現量共知，故以真性簡別立宗。	Do not contradict such acceptance and direct perception that is commonly known within one's own school, therefore we establish the thesis by specifying with the true nature.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c12_18']	真義自體說名真性，即勝義諦。	真義自體說名真性，即勝義諦。	The essence of the true meaning is called true nature, which is the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c13_12']	就勝義諦立有為空，非就世俗。	就勝義諦立有為空，非就世俗。	We establish the emptiness of the conditioned in terms of the ultimate truth, not in terms of the conventional.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c15_10']	眾緣合成有所造作故名有為，即十二處，唯除法處一分虛空、擇非擇滅及真如性。	眾緣合成有所造作故名有為，即十二處，唯除法處一分虛空、擇非擇滅及真如性。	Because it is produced by the combination of many conditions, it is called conditioned, which refers to the twelve sense bases, excluding a part of the sense base of mental objects, namely space, cessation through deliberation, cessation not through deliberation, and suchness.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c17_1']	此中復除他宗所許虛妄顯現幻等有為，若立彼為空，立已成過故。	此中復除他宗所許虛妄顯現幻等有為，若立彼為空，立已成過故。	Here, we further exclude the false appearances of illusions and so forth accepted by other schools as conditioned, because if we establish them as empty, the established [thesis] would be faulty.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c18_4']	若他遍計所執有為，就勝義諦實有自性，今立為空。	若他遍計所執有為，就勝義諦實有自性，今立為空。	If the conditioned things imagined by others in ultimate truth really have self-nature, now we establish them as empty.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c20_2']	且如眼處一種有為，就勝義諦辯其體空，空與無性虛妄顯現門之差別，是名立宗。	且如眼處一種有為，就勝義諦辯其體空，空與無性虛妄顯現門之差別，是名立宗。	For example, one kind of conditioned thing such as the eye faculty, in terms of ultimate truth, its substance is empty. The difference between emptiness and the absence of self-nature and false appearances is called establishing the thesis.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c22_4']	眾緣所起男、女、羊、鹿諸幻事等，自性實無顯現似有，所立能立法皆通有，為同法喻故說如幻。	眾緣所起男、女、羊、鹿諸幻事等，自性實無顯現似有，所立能立法皆通有，為同法喻故說如幻。	The various illusions such as men, women, sheep, deer, and so forth produced by conditions, their self-nature is really non-existent but appears as if existent. The established [thesis] and the means of establishment are all present, so it is said to be like an illusion as a similar example.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c23_17']	隨其所應假說所立能立法同，假說同故，不可一切同喻上法，皆難令有。	隨其所應假說所立能立法同，假說同故，不可一切同喻上法，皆難令有。	According to what is appropriate, the established [thesis] and the means of establishment are provisionally said to be the same. Because they are provisionally said to be the same, it is not possible for all the dharmas in the similar example to be difficult to have.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c25_1']	如說女面端嚴如月，不可難令一切月法皆面上有。	如說女面端嚴如月，不可難令一切月法皆面上有。	For example, saying that a woman's face is as beautiful as the moon, it is not possible to make the difficulty that all the dharmas of the moon are present on the face.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c25_10']	隨結頌法說此同喻。	隨結頌法說此同喻。	Following the method of composing verses, this is stated as the similar example.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c26_9']	如是次第，由此半頌是略本處，故無有失。	如是次第，由此半頌是略本處，故無有失。	In this order, because this half verse is the concise original, there is no fault.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c28_11']	所立有法皆從緣生，為立此因說緣生故，因等眾緣共所生故，說名緣生，即緣所起緣所現義。	所立有法皆從緣生，為立此因說緣生故，因等眾緣共所生故，說名緣生，即緣所起緣所現義。	The established property-possessor is all produced from conditions. In order to establish this reason, it is said to be produced from conditions. Because it is produced by the collective conditions such as causes, it is called produced from conditions, which means produced by conditions and manifested by conditions.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0268c29_15']	為遮異品立異法喻，異品無故遮義已成，是故不說。	為遮異品立異法喻，異品無故遮義已成，是故不說。	In order to refute the dissimilar class, a dissimilar example is established. Because there is no dissimilar class, the meaning of refutation is already accomplished. Therefore, it is not stated.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a01_13']	於辯釋時假說異品建立比量，亦無有過。	於辯釋時假說異品建立比量，亦無有過。	When explaining and analyzing, it is permissible to provisionally state the dissimilar class and establish inference, and there is also no fault.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a02_8', 'ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a03_3']	云何此中建立比量？🔽謂就真性眼處性空，眾緣生故。	云何此中建立比量？ 謂就真性眼處性空，眾緣生故。	How is inference established here?🔽It means that in terms of true nature, the eye faculty is empty of intrinsic nature, because it is produced from conditions.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a04_6']	諸緣生者，皆就真性其自性空，牧牛女等尚所共了。	諸緣生者，皆就真性其自性空，牧牛女等尚所共了。	All that is produced from conditions, in terms of true nature, has its intrinsic nature as empty. Even cowherds and women can understand this.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a06_13']	如有威神呪術藥力，加被草木塊塼等物，眾緣所現男女、象馬、宮殿、園林、水火等相，誑惑愚夫種種幻事。	如有威神呪術藥力，加被草木塊塼等物，眾緣所現男女、象馬、宮殿、園林、水火等相，誑惑愚夫種種幻事。	It is like the power of a powerful mantra or medicine that empowers grass, trees, clods of earth, and other objects, causing them to manifest the forms of men, women, elephants, horses, palaces, gardens, water, fire, and other things, deceiving and confusing the ignorant.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a07_8']	若彼自性少有實者，應非顛倒。	若彼自性少有實者，應非顛倒。	If they had even the slightest real nature of their own, they would not be mistaken.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a08_4']	故世尊言：	故世尊言：	Therefore the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a09_3']	「一切法性非眼所見，諸緣生法皆無自性。	「一切法性非眼所見，諸緣生法皆無自性。	The nature of all dharmas is not seen by the eyes. All dependently arisen dharmas are without self-nature.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a10_15']	諸有智者若知緣生即知法性，若知法性即知空性，若知空性即見智者。	諸有智者若知緣生即知法性，若知法性即知空性，若知空性即見智者。	The wise, if they know dependent arising, know the nature of dharmas. If they know the nature of dharmas, they know emptiness. If they know emptiness, they see the wise.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a11_1']	」又作是言：	」又作是言：	He also said:
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a11_20']	「諸緣生者皆是無生，由彼都無生自性故。	「諸緣生者皆是無生，由彼都無生自性故。	All dependently arisen things are non-arisen, because they are completely without the nature of arising.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a12_17']	若說緣生即說空性，知空性者即無放逸。	若說緣生即說空性，知空性者即無放逸。	If one speaks of dependent arising, one speaks of emptiness. One who knows emptiness is without negligence.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a13_11']	」此中一切不空論者皆設難言：	」此中一切不空論者皆設難言：	Here, all those who do not accept emptiness raise objections, saying:
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a15_1']	若立一切有為皆空，便無色等，如緣兔角現量智生，理不成就；	若立一切有為皆空，便無色等，如緣兔角現量智生，理不成就；	If you establish that all conditioned things are empty, then there would be no form, just as the cognition of direct perception that arises in dependence on the horns of a rabbit is not established;
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a15_15']	似色等緣諸現量覺，亦應不生。	似色等緣諸現量覺，亦應不生。	the cognition of direct perception that arises in dependence on form, etc. would also not arise.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a18_10']	然彼實有各別內證，是故汝宗憎背法性，便有違害現量過失，及有違害共知過失，撥無一切牧牛人等同所了知眼等體故。	然彼實有各別內證，是故汝宗憎背法性，便有違害現量過失，及有違害共知過失，撥無一切牧牛人等同所了知眼等體故。	However, they really exist and are each individually realized internally. Therefore, your school, hating and turning away from the nature of dharmas, has the fault of contradicting direct perception, and has the fault of contradicting what is commonly known, because it denies the substance of the eye, etc., which is commonly understood by all cowherds and others.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a20_12']	諸有智者，今當遣除朋黨執毒住處中慧，應共思議我所立宗，為當違害自相續中所生現量？	諸有智者，今當遣除朋黨執毒住處中慧，應共思議我所立宗，為當違害自相續中所生現量？	Now, the wise should remove the poison of sectarian attachment and abide in the wisdom of the middle way. They should think together about the thesis I have established: Does it contradict the direct perception that arises in one's own continuum?
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a21_7']	為當違害他相續中所生現量？	為當違害他相續中所生現量？	Or does it contradict the direct perception that arises in the continuum of another?
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a24_12']	若言違害自相續中所生現量，諸現量覺就勝義諦自性皆空，眾緣生故，如睡夢中諸現量覺非實現量，是故我宗且不違害自相續中所生現量。	若言違害自相續中所生現量，諸現量覺就勝義諦自性皆空，眾緣生故，如睡夢中諸現量覺非實現量，是故我宗且不違害自相續中所生現量。	If you say that it contradicts the direct perception that arises in one's own continuum, that all direct perceptions are empty of intrinsic nature in ultimate truth because they arise from many conditions, like the direct perceptions in a dream are not real direct perceptions, therefore our school does not contradict the direct perception that arises in one's own continuum.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a28_4']	若言違害他相續中所生現量，非淨眼者顯彼眾多，眼瞖眩者所見不實，髮、蠅、月等是虛妄現，違害現量應正道理，是故我宗亦不違害他相續中所生現量。	若言違害他相續中所生現量，非淨眼者顯彼眾多，眼瞖眩者所見不實，髮、蠅、月等是虛妄現，違害現量應正道理，是故我宗亦不違害他相續中所生現量。	If you say that it contradicts the direct perception that arises in another's continuum, it is not correct to say that the many things seen by someone with cataracts, such as hairs, flies, and double moons, are false appearances that contradict direct perception, therefore our school also does not contradict the direct perception that arises in another's continuum.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269a29_17']	若總相說，如愚夫等一切世俗所生現量，今此不遮，世俗有故無容違害。	若總相說，如愚夫等一切世俗所生現量，今此不遮，世俗有故無容違害。	If it is said in general terms, like the direct perceptions produced by all worldly people, this is not refuted now, because worldly existence is possible without contradiction.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269b01_11']	言有違害共知過失，此亦不然。	言有違害共知過失，此亦不然。	Saying that there is the fault of contradicting commonly known things is also not correct.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269b02_10']	若言違害自論共知不應道理，自論許故。	若言違害自論共知不應道理，自論許故。	If it is said that contradicting what is commonly known in one's own treatises is not correct, because it is accepted in one's own treatises,
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269b03_8']	設違自論是違自宗，非是違害共知過失。	設違自論是違自宗，非是違害共知過失。	If it contradicts one’s own treatises, it contradicts one’s own tenets, but it is not a fault of contradicting what is commonly known.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269b04_16']	若言違害他論共知亦不應理，一切論興皆為破遣他共知故。	若言違害他論共知亦不應理，一切論興皆為破遣他共知故。	If it is said that contradicting what is commonly known by others is also unreasonable, this is because all treatises are composed in order to refute what is commonly known by others.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269b06_18']	若言違害牧牛人等共所了知亦不應理，諸佛弟子立一切行皆剎那滅，諸法無我亦無有情。	若言違害牧牛人等共所了知亦不應理，諸佛弟子立一切行皆剎那滅，諸法無我亦無有情。	If it is said that contradicting what is commonly known by cowherds and others is also unreasonable, this is because the disciples of the Buddha establish that all conditioned things are momentary, that all dharmas are without self and also without sentient beings.
['ZH_T30_1578_001:0269b07_13']	諸勝論者，實異色等有異實等；	諸勝論者，實異色等有異實等；	The Vaiśeṣikas say that substance is different from color, etc., and that there are differences within substance, etc.;
