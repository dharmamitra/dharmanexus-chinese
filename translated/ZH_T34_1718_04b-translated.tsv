['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0058c26_4']	次離五濁文，為四譬之本，開而不合。	次離五濁文，為四譬之本，開而不合。	Next, the text on leaving the five turbidities is the basis for the four parables, opening them up but not combining them.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0058c26_17']	不虛為不虛譬本，不合不開。	不虛為不虛譬本，不合不開。	Not being empty is the basis for the parable of not being empty, not combining or opening.

Previously, the direct explanation of the Dharma caused the superior capacity to immediately understand and awaken, but the middling and inferior capacities had not yet awakened. Therefore, parables were used to illustrate the three and one, causing them to understand clearly.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059a10_1']	前法說中既略廣開三顯一，後譬說中亦應略廣許三賜一，因緣中亦應引三入一，若作三譬、六譬、十譬，於三周之文不合，於四人信解乖離，是所不用。	前法說中既略廣開三顯一，後譬說中亦應略廣許三賜一，因緣中亦應引三入一，若作三譬、六譬、十譬，於三周之文不合，於四人信解乖離，是所不用。	In the previous explanation of the Dharma, the three were briefly opened and the one was revealed. Later, in the explanation through parables, the three should also be briefly allowed and the one bestowed. In the chapter on causes and conditions, the three should also be drawn into the one. If three, six, or ten parables were used, it would not correspond with the text of the three periods, and it would be discordant with the faith and understanding of the four types of people. This is not what I use.

Lack of peace and security refers to the realm of the three realms of birth and death where one practices transformation. It is called lack of peace and security because it has the obstructions of the five turbidities, serving as the basis for the parable of the burning house below.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059a21_1']	眾生即是五道受化之徒，為下五百人譬作本。	眾生即是五道受化之徒，為下五百人譬作本。	Sentient beings are the followers who receive the teaching in the five paths, serving as the basis for the parable of the five hundred people below.

['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059b26_1']	又一時大開為三譬：	又一時大開為三譬：	Moreover, the great revelation at one time is divided into three parables:

['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c01_14']	若承上本下略廣二頌，則通三周及信解中，文之與義悉皆不闕。	若承上本下略廣二頌，則通三周及信解中，文之與義悉皆不闕。	If one follows the above basis and the brief and extensive two verses below, then the three periods and the understanding in faith are all not lacking in text and meaning.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c03_13']	若約廣頌，更開四意頌上四義，為下四譬作本，此亦通三周及信解中文義不闕。	若約廣頌，更開四意頌上四義，為下四譬作本，此亦通三周及信解中文義不闕。	If we discuss the extensive verses, they further open up four meanings to praise the above four meanings, serving as the basis for the following four parables. This also covers the three periods and the text and meaning in the chapter on understanding and faith.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c06_8']	若更子派，開頌五濁中為三，開頌方便中為二，開頌顯實中為四，不虛中但一，合成十意，作下十譬之本。	若更子派，開頌五濁中為三，開頌方便中為二，開頌顯實中為四，不虛中但一，合成十意，作下十譬之本。	If we further branch out, opening up the verses on the five turbidities into three, opening up the verses on skillful means into two, opening up the verses on revealing the truth into four, and only having one on the non-emptiness, forming ten meanings, serving as the basis for the following ten parables.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c08_11']	此之十意但在法、譬兩周，信解及因緣中其文則闕，故作三節開章承上本下，非是無趣漫作。	此之十意但在法、譬兩周，信解及因緣中其文則闕，故作三節開章承上本下，非是無趣漫作。	These ten meanings are only in the two periods of the Dharma and parables. In the chapter on understanding and faith and the chapter on causes and conditions, the text is then lacking. Therefore, the sections are opened up in three parts, continuing from the basis above and below, and are not aimlessly made without direction.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c10_3']	頌略中初一行，頌上顯實，後一行頌上開權，此文雖窄，具頌四一。	頌略中初一行，頌上顯實，後一行頌上開權，此文雖窄，具頌四一。	In the brief praise, the first line praises the above revelation of the truth, and the last line praises the above disclosure of skillful means.

['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c13_5']	「安隱」者，涅槃祕藏是安隱處，佛自住其中，亦安置眾生入祕密藏。	「安隱」者，涅槃祕藏是安隱處，佛自住其中，亦安置眾生入祕密藏。	Peace and security refers to the secret treasury of nirvana, which is a place of peace and security. The Buddha himself abides within it and also places sentient beings within the secret treasury.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c15_3']	安隱處即頌理一，眾生即頌人一，種種法門入於佛道即頌行一，宣示即教一。	安隱處即頌理一，眾生即頌人一，種種法門入於佛道即頌行一，宣示即教一。	The place of peace and security corresponds to the oneness of principle in the verse, sentient beings correspond to the oneness of people, the various Dharma gates entering the Buddha Way correspond to the oneness of practice, and proclaiming corresponds to the oneness of teaching.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c15_16']	「智慧力」者，即權智力也。	「智慧力」者，即權智力也。	Wisdom and power refers to the power of expedient wisdom.

['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c19_9']	二偈雖略，收佛一化開權顯實，原始要終罄無不盡，故稱略頌為下總譬本也。	二偈雖略，收佛一化開權顯實，原始要終罄無不盡，故稱略頌為下總譬本也。	Although the two verses are brief, they encompass the Buddha's entire teaching of revealing the real after removing the provisional. From beginning to end, there is nothing that is not completely included, and therefore the brief verse is called the basis for the following general simile.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0059c20_13']	二、從「我以佛眼觀」下，四十一行半，廣頌上六義。	二、從「我以佛眼觀」下，四十一行半，廣頌上六義。	2. From I observe with the Buddha-eye below, there are forty-one and a half lines extensively praising the above six meanings.

['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0060a01_1']	上云為五濁故說三，今云為五濁故出世，出世本應說大，障不獲已，故前說小。	上云為五濁故說三，今云為五濁故出世，出世本應說大，障不獲已，故前說小。	The text above says that the three are taught due to the five turbidities. Now it says that the world appears due to the five turbidities. The original purpose of appearing in the world was to teach the great, but due to obstacles, the small was taught first.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0060a01_6']	此又為三：	此又為三：	This is divided into three parts:

Raising the below to prove the above, it is known that the Buddha is in the stage of the Dharma body, always using the perfectly still Buddha eye to universally illuminate the various capacities. If the faculties are sharp and the turbidities light, then he uses the image of Vairocana to expound the Dharma of the One Vehicle;
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0060a09_16']	若根鈍濁重，則脫瓔珞以老比丘像，驚入火宅方便開三，秖是于時鑒機，故言「我以佛眼觀見」也。	若根鈍濁重，則脫瓔珞以老比丘像，驚入火宅方便開三，秖是于時鑒機，故言「我以佛眼觀見」也。	If the faculties are dull and the turbidities heavy, then he removes the necklaces and uses the image of an old bhikṣu, startlingly entering the burning house to expediently open the Three. This is just the discernment of capacities at that time, therefore it says I observe and see with the Buddha eye.
['ZH_T34_1718_04b:0060a11_7']	若觀色法應用天眼，若分別根機應用法眼，云何言以佛眼見耶？	若觀色法應用天眼，若分別根機應用法眼，云何言以佛眼見耶？	If contemplating form dharmas, one should use the heavenly eye. If discerning faculties and capacities, one should use the Dharma eye. How can it be said that one sees with the Buddha eye?

Some say that the various views are precisely suffering, and suffering is the cause of action. Hoping to abandon suffering by practicing this, how could it be possible?
