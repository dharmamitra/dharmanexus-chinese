The names are generally labeled as three, and the characteristics of the teachings are divided into four. Therefore, the Lotus Sutra does not clarify the characteristics of the teachings, causing the previous four meanings to be obscure and unexpressed. Without the expression of the four meanings, the wonderful Dharma is difficult to clarify. Therefore, not clarifying the characteristics of the teachings is actually lacking in principle.

The expedient teachings revealed in the sutras before the Lotus Sutra, such as the separate teachings in the Huayan Sutra, the four agamas of the Deer Park, the three of the Vaipulya Sutra, and the two of the Prajnaparamita Sutra, are only the framework and outline of the perfect teaching.

From after the time of Great Brightness up to the present, in the intervals of this period, the Buddha has employed various teachings to transform sentient beings, all in accordance with the capacities and dispositions of sentient beings, whether gradual or sudden, great or small, all for the sake of taking in the capacities of sentient beings and bestowing the Dharma distinctions.

From the seeds they have planted it correctly brings up the present sūtra, narrating the meaning of using the teachings in the one great matter. Therefore the previous text says, From the beginning of the Flower Ornament Sūtra up to the Prajñāpāramitā, it does not explain the meaning of establishing the teachings. Therefore from here below it brings up the meaning of the present sūtra, narrating the basis for the use of the teachings in the one great matter. Therefore the initial teaching of the Flower Ornament Sūtra means to be for those with the great capacity. Speaking without involving the small means the three meanings are not yet complete. One, it does not include the small capacities. Two, it does not reveal the provisional. Three, it does not reveal the traces.

The meaning is for those of the small capacity. It also has three meanings that are not yet complete. One, it does not involve the great capacities. The other two are the same as before.

The Buddha then agreed to subdue those māras with the Mahā-dhāraṇī, and later expounded the methods for eliminating offenses and cultivating practice.

Since the meaning of the request was far-reaching, the teachings at the Deer Park and the Vaipulya teachings still did not satisfy Brahma's mind. Therefore, even up to the Prajñāpāramitā, it is still responding to the initial request.

After finishing, he said, The buddhas of the three times and ten directions have no one who does not explain these ten grounds. All bodhisattvas follow the Buddha's explanation and speak like this. After speaking, he remained silent. All bodhisattvas, having heard this, thirsted to hear it and each thought, Why did Vajra Treasury Bodhisattva explain the names of the ten grounds and then remain silent?

If we rely on the two places where the bodhisattvas are guests and hosts for each other, they are both in deep positions, so it seems they are equal. Therefore, it says if there is a difference. Although the leaders of the two assemblies are Śākyamuni and Mahāvairocana, they are merely slightly different in robes and necklaces, but their inner bodies are not different.

Knowing each other is close, and giving rise to the mind is secret. Knowing each other can mutually benefit each other, but giving rise to the mind does not change the teacher's position.

This means that the teacher of transformation and the retinue are both the same as the one body and the immeasurable bodies, mutually being the host and companion, the same yet not the same, the one body and the many bodies freely interpenetrating, yet concealing the teaching of the manifestation of the bodies, only saying that the host and companion are related.

The born body has cold, heat, and even nine vexations, while the Dharma body is without illness. Therefore, he asks about the born body but does not ask about the Dharma body.

How could it be that because of the inferior capacity, the Buddha temporarily manifests impermanence, and then uses impermanence to falsely accuse the Dharma nature and make it impermanent?

If one gives rise to the mind of great compassion to benefit beings, one should be in birth and death to form karmic connections with beings, planting seeds and liberating them to bring them to maturity. Therefore, the two vehicles have already severed birth and death and permanently make a barrier with birth and death, so they cannot enter birth and death again to benefit beings.
