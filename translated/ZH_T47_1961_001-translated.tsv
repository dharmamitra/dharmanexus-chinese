Without the power of patience, the mind follows objects and is bound by sounds and forms. One falls into the three evil paths oneself, so how can one save sentient beings?

Perhaps due to generosity, precepts, and cultivating merit, one is born among humans and becomes a king, minister, or wealthy and powerful person.

Greedy, deluded, and indulgent, one widely creates many offenses. Riding on this evil karma, one enters the three evil paths and experiences countless eons. Emerging from the hells, one receives a poor and lowly body;
