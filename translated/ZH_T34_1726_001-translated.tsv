Abiding in existence is not eternal quiescence, entering the principle of non-duality. Thus, the three karmas lead to requests and liberation from the limits of suffering, and the four great vows ensure the attainment of supreme bliss. Therefore, in the Saha world, he receives the name of fearlessness, and in the Buddha's treasury, he receives the name of Avalokitesvara. Having already attained perfect enlightenment, he is called Samantabhadra. Next, he will be the successor, called Samantabhadra.

It is simply the wondrous principle, empty and penetrating, provisionally speaking of name and form within the nameless and formless. Therefore, it establishes the name of the nameless and provisionally designates person and dharma. Although it is not a number, it is also discussed in terms of numbers.

['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877b13_8']	譬如人受一期果報，攬陰成人，雖具無量德行，必先標名字，故以人法居初，意亦例此。	譬如人受一期果報，攬陰成人，雖具無量德行，必先標名字，故以人法居初，意亦例此。	It is like a person receiving a lifetime of karmic retribution, grasping the aggregates to form a person. Although possessing innumerable virtues and practices, one must first establish a name, so using people and dharmas as the initial is also intended to be an example of this.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877b14_8']	人法居九義之初可爾，何意乘以人法為次耶？	人法居九義之初可爾，何意乘以人法為次耶？	It is reasonable for people and dharmas to be the initial among the nine meanings, but why does the vehicle use people and dharmas as the next?

The sutra says, For this cause and condition, he is called Avalokitesvara, which clarifies the person first, and later says, The power of skillful means, manifesting in all ways, which then discusses the Dharma. Since people can uphold the Dharma, it is called people and dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877b19_22']	二次慈悲者，良由觀音之人觀於實相普門之法，達於非人、非法實相之理，一切眾生亦復如是，故《華嚴》云「心、佛及眾生，是三無差別。	二次慈悲者，良由觀音之人觀於實相普門之法，達於非人、非法實相之理，一切眾生亦復如是，故《華嚴》云「心、佛及眾生，是三無差別。	Second, regarding compassion, it is precisely because Avalokitesvara observes the principle of the universal gate of reality, and penetrates the principle of reality that is neither a person nor a dharma, that all sentient beings are also like this. Therefore, the Huayan Sutra says, The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings, these three are no different.

['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877b24_9']	復次，若就言說為便，初慈後悲，亦是就菩薩本懷，欲大慈與樂，既不得樂，次大悲拔苦，故初慈後悲。	復次，若就言說為便，初慈後悲，亦是就菩薩本懷，欲大慈與樂，既不得樂，次大悲拔苦，故初慈後悲。	Furthermore, if we take the convenience of language, compassion comes first and compassion comes later. This is also based on the original intention of the bodhisattva, who wishes to bestow great compassion and happiness. Since they do not obtain happiness, next, with great compassion, they eliminate suffering. Therefore, compassion comes first and compassion comes later.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877b26_9']	若從用次第者，初以大悲拔苦，後方以大慈與樂，又就行者先脫苦、後蒙樂，故先悲後慈。	若從用次第者，初以大悲拔苦，後方以大慈與樂，又就行者先脫苦、後蒙樂，故先悲後慈。	If following the order of application, first using great compassion to pull out suffering, then using great kindness to bestow happiness.

['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c05_11']	又，資故先福、導故先慧。	又，資故先福、導故先慧。	Moreover, blessings are the basis, while wisdom is the guide.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c06_17']	四真應者，若智慧轉明則契於法性，法性即實相，名為法身。	四真應者，若智慧轉明則契於法性，法性即實相，名為法身。	As for the fourth, true and provisional, if wisdom becomes increasingly bright, then it accords with the nature of dharmas. The nature of dharmas is precisely the true aspect, which is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c08_5']	法身既顯，能從真起應，真顯應起，只由福慧開發，故次第四也。	法身既顯，能從真起應，真顯應起，只由福慧開發，故次第四也。	Since the Dharma body is already manifest, it can arise from the true and manifest the provisional. The true is revealed and the provisional arises, precisely because blessings and wisdom are developed. Therefore, there is a fourth stage.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c09_1']	又，若就方便化物，先用應、後用真。	又，若就方便化物，先用應、後用真。	Moreover, if one uses expedient means to transform beings, one first uses the provisional and then uses the true.

First, clarifying the true and provisional, directly speaking of realization and attainment, not yet involving benefiting others. Now, it is clarified that both bodies are able to benefit beings. The true body destroys grasping at characteristics, likened to medicine. The provisional body responds to myriad conditions, likened to a jewel.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c12_16']	就兩字明次第者，與慈悲相似也。	就兩字明次第者，與慈悲相似也。	In terms of the two characters, it clarifies the sequence, which is similar to compassion.

Now, it is discussed that the conditions that are benefited may obtain obscure benefits or manifest benefits, so it is explained after the two bodies.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c15_11']	七明權實者，前緣得益，何意不同？	七明權實者，前緣得益，何意不同？	Seventh, clarifying the expedient and the real: The previous conditions that obtain benefits, why are they not the same?
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c16_19']	良由權巧無方，赴機允當，不失其宜，二智之力，故以此為次也。	良由權巧無方，赴機允當，不失其宜，二智之力，故以此為次也。	It is precisely because of the expedient skillful means that there is no fixed pattern, responding to the capacities of beings in a proper manner, without missing the appropriate time. This is the power of the two knowledges, so this is the sequence.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c17_12']	先權後實者，此就淺深為次也。	先權後實者，此就淺深為次也。	First, the expedient, and then the real: This is the sequence based on shallow and deep.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c18_13']	若依文者，先以實益，次以權度，此隨物為次。	若依文者，先以實益，次以權度，此隨物為次。	If based on the text, first with real benefits, and then with expedient means, this is the sequence based on beings.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c20_2']	若就佛本意，先只為一大事因緣，先顯實益，眾生未堪，後用權度。	若就佛本意，先只為一大事因緣，先顯實益，眾生未堪，後用權度。	If based on the Buddha's original intention, first only for the cause and condition of the great matter, first manifesting real benefits, beings not yet able to bear it, later using expedient means.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c24_3']	八明本迹者，雖復益物，權實之巧，而巧有優降，必是上、中、下智本迹之殊，權實略而且橫，今欲細判高下以明次位，若其本高，所作權實之迹則妙，是故次總略之後，辯其細妙之能也。	八明本迹者，雖復益物，權實之巧，而巧有優降，必是上、中、下智本迹之殊，權實略而且橫，今欲細判高下以明次位，若其本高，所作權實之迹則妙，是故次總略之後，辯其細妙之能也。	Eighth, clarifying the fundamental and traces. Although benefiting beings with the skillful means of provisional and real, the skill has superior and inferior, which must be the distinction of the superior, middling, and inferior wisdom's fundamental and traces. The provisional and real are briefly and horizontally explained. Now, wanting to finely distinguish the high and low to clarify the stages, if its foundation is high, the traces of the provisional and real it creates are wonderful. Therefore, after the general and brief explanation, its subtle and wonderful ability is debated.
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c24_15']	非本無以垂迹，故先明本；	非本無以垂迹，故先明本；	Without the foundation, there is no way to manifest the traces. Therefore, the foundation is clarified first;
['ZH_T34_1726_001:0877c25_7']	非迹無以顯本，應先迹也。	非迹無以顯本，應先迹也。	Without the traces, there is no way to reveal the foundation. The traces should be explained first.

The practitioner above arouses the mind and practices, from the cause to attain the fruition, transforming others and benefiting beings, the depth and shallowness are not the same. From the person and dharma to the true and response, this is the sequence of one's own practice. The medicine and pearl to the fundamental and traces is the sequence of transforming others. This is the sequence of following the discussion, not yet tracing back to the fundamental.

Therefore Buddhas forever have no more evil. Because of sovereignty, they extensively use various evil dharmas to transform and liberate sentient beings. All day long they employ them, all day long they are not tainted. Because they are not tainted, they do not arise. How can you take icchantikas as an analogy?

Wholesome and unwholesome [actions] are supported by it as the seeds of all [dharmas]. Since icchantikas do not sever indeterminate ignorance, they still give rise to wholesome [roots].

Although he gives rise to evil, his understanding mind is unstained. Penetrating the extremity of evil is precisely the ultimate reality. He can attain liberation through the characteristics of the five heinous crimes, and is neither bound nor liberated. He practices the non-way and penetrates the Buddha way;
