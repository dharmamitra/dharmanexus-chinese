['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a10_8']	辯緣起品第四之三已辯內外羯剌藍等種等道理因果相續，應知此即說名緣起。	辯緣起品第四之三已辯內外羯剌藍等種等道理因果相續，應知此即說名緣起。	Chapter 4, Part 3: Discrimination of Dependent Origination, having already distinguished the principles of internal and external kalala, etc., seeds, etc., cause and effect continuity, one should know that this is called dependent origination.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a10_17']	如是緣起其相云何？	如是緣起其相云何？	What are the characteristics of such dependent origination?

['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a12_0']	如是諸緣起，　　十二支三際，	如是諸緣起，　　十二支三際，	Thus, dependent origination has twelve factors and three periods,
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a13_13']	前後際各二，　　中八據圓滿。	前後際各二，　　中八據圓滿。	Each with two in the past and future, and eight in the middle according to completeness.

['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a14_11']	非諸緣起唯有十二。	非諸緣起唯有十二。	Dependent origination is not only twelve.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a14_16']	云何知然？	云何知然？	How do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a15_1']	如本論說：	如本論說：	As the Abhidharma treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a15_7']	云何為緣起？	云何為緣起？	What is dependent origination?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a15_13']	謂一切有為。	謂一切有為。	It refers to all conditioned [dharmas].
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a17_2', 'ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a17_15']	然契經中辯緣起處，或時具說十二有支，如《勝義空契經》等說。🔽或說十一，如《智事》等經。	然契經中辯緣起處，或時具說十二有支，如《勝義空契經》等說。 或說十一，如《智事》等經。	However, when explaining dependent origination, sometimes all twelve factors are fully explained, as in the Sūtra on the Emptiness of Ultimate Reality and other sūtras.🔽Sometimes eleven are explained, as in the Sūtra on the Characteristics of Wisdom and other sūtras.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a18_4']	或唯說十，如《成喻經》等。	或唯說十，如《成喻經》等。	Sometimes only ten are explained, as in the Sūtra on the Parable of the Raft and other sūtras.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a18_20']	或復說九，如《大緣起契經》中說。	或復說九，如《大緣起契經》中說。	Or it is said to be nine, as stated in the Mahāpratītyasamutpāda Sūtra.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a19_7']	或說有八，如契經言：	或說有八，如契經言：	Or it is said to be eight, as a sūtra says:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a20_5']	諸有沙門或婆羅門，不如實知諸法性等。	諸有沙門或婆羅門，不如實知諸法性等。	All śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas who do not know the nature of dharmas as they really are...
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a21_4']	諸如是等所說差別，何緣論說與經有異？	諸如是等所說差別，何緣論說與經有異？	For what reason does the treatise differ from the sūtras in its explanations?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a22_12']	論隨法性，經順化宜，故契經中分別緣起，隨所化者機宜異說。	論隨法性，經順化宜，故契經中分別緣起，隨所化者機宜異說。	The treatise follows the nature of dharmas, while the sūtras accord with what is suitable for transforming [beings]. Therefore, in the sūtras, dependent arising is explained according to the capacities of those to be transformed.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a23_2']	或論了義，經義不了。	或論了義，經義不了。	Or the treatise has definitive meaning, while the meaning of the sūtras is not definitive.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a24_10']	或論通說有情無情，契經但依有情數說，依有情故染淨得成。	或論通說有情無情，契經但依有情數說，依有情故染淨得成。	Or the treatise explains both sentient and insentient [dharmas], while the sūtras only explain in terms of sentient beings. Because of sentient beings, defilement and purity can be established.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a26_7']	佛為有情開顯此二，但為此事佛現世間，故契經中依有情說，為欲成立大義利故。	佛為有情開顯此二，但為此事佛現世間，故契經中依有情說，為欲成立大義利故。	The Buddha reveals these two for the sake of sentient beings. He appears in the world only for this matter. Therefore, in the sūtras, it is explained in terms of sentient beings, in order to establish the great benefit.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840a28_6']	分別緣起諸有支中，具無量門義類差別，今且略辯三生分位無間相續有十二支：	分別緣起諸有支中，具無量門義類差別，今且略辯三生分位無間相續有十二支：	In the various members of dependent arising, there are innumerable categories of meanings. Now, I will briefly discuss the twelve members in the uninterrupted continuity of the three stages of birth:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b01_1']	一無明、二行、三識、四名色、五六處、六觸、七受、八愛、九取、十有、十一生、十二老死。	一無明、二行、三識、四名色、五六處、六觸、七受、八愛、九取、十有、十一生、十二老死。	1. ignorance, 2. karmic formations, 3. consciousness, 4. name-and-form, 5. six sense bases, 6. contact, 7. feeling, 8. craving, 9. grasping, 10. becoming, 11. birth, 12. old age and death.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b02_6']	言三際者，一前際、二後際、三中際，即是過未及現三生。	言三際者，一前際、二後際、三中際，即是過未及現三生。	As for the three periods of time, the first is the past, the second is the future, and the third is the present, which are the three lives of the past, future, and present.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b02_17']	云何十二支於三際建立？	云何十二支於三際建立？	How are the twelve members established in the three periods of time?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b03_17']	謂前後際各立二支，中際八支，故成十二。	謂前後際各立二支，中際八支，故成十二。	It is because two members are established for the past and future, and eight for the present, thus making twelve.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b04_9']	無明、行在前際，謂過去生。	無明、行在前際，謂過去生。	Ignorance and karmic formations are in the past, referring to past lives.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b05_2']	生、老死在後際，謂未來生。	生、老死在後際，謂未來生。	Birth and old age and death are in the future, referring to future lives.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b05_14']	所餘八在中際，謂現在生。	所餘八在中際，謂現在生。	The remaining eight are in the present, referring to the present life.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b07_12']	前際二因所招五果，後際二果所待三因，非諸一生皆具此八，據圓滿者說有八支。	前際二因所招五果，後際二果所待三因，非諸一生皆具此八，據圓滿者說有八支。	The five effects attracted by the two causes of the prior limit are the three causes that are the support for the two effects of the later limit. It is not the case that all existences are endowed with these eight. It is said that there are eight members in the case of a complete existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b07_17']	圓滿者何？	圓滿者何？	What is meant by complete?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b09_2']	謂支無缺，或由圓滿惑業所招，謂先增上惑業所引。	謂支無缺，或由圓滿惑業所招，謂先增上惑業所引。	It means that the members are not lacking, or that they are attracted by complete passions and actions, that is, they are attracted by superior passions and actions.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b11_2']	此中意說補特伽羅歷一切位名圓滿者，非諸中夭及色無色、羯剌藍等，諸位闕故。	此中意說補特伽羅歷一切位名圓滿者，非諸中夭及色無色、羯剌藍等，諸位闕故。	What is meant here is that a person who passes through all the states is called complete, not those who die in the middle, or those in the form and formless realms, or those in the state of kalala, etc., because some states are lacking.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b12_17']	世尊但約欲界少分補特伽羅說具十二，如《大緣起契經》中說，佛告阿難：	世尊但約欲界少分補特伽羅說具十二，如《大緣起契經》中說，佛告阿難：	The World Honored One spoke only of the twelve members in relation to a part of a person in the desire realm, as the Mahāpratītyasamutpāda Sūtra says, the Buddha told Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b13_8']	識若不入胎，得增廣大不？	識若不入胎，得增廣大不？	If consciousness does not enter the womb, can it grow and become great?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b13_11']	不也。	不也。	No, World Honored One.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b13_14']	世尊！	世尊！	The Buddha said:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b13_19']	乃至廣說。	乃至廣說。	And so on, at length.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b15_6']	是故若有補特伽羅，於次前生造無明行，具招現在識等五支。	是故若有補特伽羅，於次前生造無明行，具招現在識等五支。	Therefore, if there is a person who creates ignorance and action in the immediately prior existence, they will fully attract the five members of consciousness, etc., in the present existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b16_5']	復於現生造愛、取、有，招次後世生等二支。	復於現生造愛、取、有，招次後世生等二支。	Also, in the present life one creates craving, grasping, and becoming, which attract the two members of birth and so on in the next life.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b17_12']	應知此經依彼而說，若依一切補特伽羅立諸有支便成雜亂。	應知此經依彼而說，若依一切補特伽羅立諸有支便成雜亂。	You should understand that this scripture explains the members of existence in terms of the above. If one established the members of existence in terms of all sentient beings, there would be confusion.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b19_10']	謂彼或有現在五支非次前生無明、行果，及次後世生、老死支非現在生愛取有果。	謂彼或有現在五支非次前生無明、行果，及次後世生、老死支非現在生愛取有果。	That is, some sentient beings in the present may have the five members of the present life that are not the results of ignorance and karmic forces in the immediately preceding life, and the members of birth and old age and death in the next life may not be the results of craving, grasping, and becoming in the present life.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b20_19', 'ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b22_10']	彼皆非此經意所明，勿見果因相去隔絕，便疑因果感赴無能。🔽應知緣起支略唯二，分前後際如次七支五支，以果與因屬因果故。	彼皆非此經意所明，勿見果因相去隔絕，便疑因果感赴無能。 應知緣起支略唯二，分前後際如次七支五支，以果與因屬因果故。	These are not what this scripture means to make clear. Do not suppose that the cause and effect are separated by a great distance and that there is no power to attract cause and effect.🔽You should understand that the members of conditioned arising are in brief of two kinds, divided into the seven members of the prior limit and the five members of the subsequent limit, because the members are categorized as cause and effect.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b23_8']	或因與果五支七支，以因攝因果攝果故。	或因與果五支七支，以因攝因果攝果故。	Or, the members are of two kinds, the five members and the seven members, because the five members are categorized as cause, and the seven members are categorized as effect.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b25_15']	謂現愛、取即過無明，現在有支即過去行，現在世識即未來生，餘現四支即當老死，是名因果二分差別。	謂現愛、取即過無明，現在有支即過去行，現在世識即未來生，餘現四支即當老死，是名因果二分差別。	That is, present craving and grasping are past ignorance, the present existence is past action, the present consciousness is future birth, and the remaining four present members are future old age and death. This is called the distinction of cause and effect.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b26_15']	既說三際立十二支，謂無明行，乃至廣說。	既說三際立十二支，謂無明行，乃至廣說。	Since it is said that the twelve members are established in the three periods of time, referring to ignorance, action, and so on.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b27_4']	此中何法名為無明？	此中何法名為無明？	What dharma is called ignorance in this context?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b27_13']	乃至何法名為老死？	乃至何法名為老死？	Up to what dharma is called old age and death?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b27_16']	頌曰：	頌曰：	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b28_0']	宿惑位無明，　　宿諸業名行，	宿惑位無明，　　宿諸業名行，	The state of past afflictions is ignorance, and past actions are called action.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840b29_0']	識正結生蘊，　　六處前名色，	識正結生蘊，　　六處前名色，	The aggregates that just connect with birth are consciousness, and before the six sense bases are name-and-form.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c01_0']	從生眼等根，　　三和前六處，	從生眼等根，　　三和前六處，	From birth, the eye and other faculties, the three combined before the six sense bases,
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c02_0']	於三受因異，　　未了知名觸，	於三受因異，　　未了知名觸，	Before the distinction of the causes of the three feelings, the state of not yet understanding is called contact.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c03_0']	在婬愛前受，　　貪資具婬愛，	在婬愛前受，　　貪資具婬愛，	Before sexual desire and love, there is feeling. Craving for possessions is sexual desire and love.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c04_0']	為得諸境界，　　遍馳求名取，	為得諸境界，　　遍馳求名取，	In order to obtain various sense objects, the state of seeking everywhere is called grasping.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c05_0']	有謂正能造，　　牽當有果業，	有謂正能造，　　牽當有果業，	Existence refers to the present ability to create action that attracts future results.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c06_13']	結當有名生，　　至當受老死。	結當有名生，　　至當受老死。	The formation of the name of the future is birth, up to the future experience of old age and death.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c07_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c08_1']	於宿生中諸煩惱位至今果熟，總謂無明。	於宿生中諸煩惱位至今果熟，總謂無明。	The state of afflictions in past lives, when the fruits of the present are ripe, is generally called ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c08_11']	何故無明聲總說煩惱？	何故無明聲總說煩惱？	Why is the term ignorance used to generally refer to afflictions?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c09_2']	與牽後有行為定因故。	與牽後有行為定因故。	Because it is the definite cause of the karma that leads to subsequent existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c10_5']	業由惑發能牽後有，無惑有業後有無故非牽後有。	業由惑發能牽後有，無惑有業後有無故非牽後有。	Karma arises from delusion and can lead to subsequent existence. Without delusion, there is karma, but subsequent existence is not possible. Therefore, it does not lead to subsequent existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c11_17']	諸行生時貪等於中皆有作用，彼行起位定賴無明，故無明聲總說煩惱。	諸行生時貪等於中皆有作用，彼行起位定賴無明，故無明聲總說煩惱。	When the various karmic formations arise, craving and so forth all have a function within them. Those karmic formations arise relying on ignorance. Therefore, the term ignorance generally refers to afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c12_17']	若爾，何故唯前生惑總謂無明，此生不爾？	若爾，何故唯前生惑總謂無明，此生不爾？	If that is so, why is it that only the afflictions of past lives are generally called ignorance, and not those of this life?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c13_6']	唯前生惑似無明故。	唯前生惑似無明故。	This is because only the afflictions of past lives resemble ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c14_6']	貪等煩惱未得果時，勢力無虧說為明利。	貪等煩惱未得果時，勢力無虧說為明利。	When the afflictions such as craving have not yet obtained their fruits, their power is not diminished and is called clear and sharp.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c15_2']	若得果已，取與用虧不名明利。	若得果已，取與用虧不名明利。	If they have obtained their fruits, their function of taking and giving is diminished and is not called clear and sharp.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c16_6']	無明勢力設未虧損亦非明利，彼現行時亦難知故。	無明勢力設未虧損亦非明利，彼現行時亦難知故。	Even though the power of ignorance has not yet been destroyed, it is not clear and sharp, because it is difficult to know when it is actually functioning.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c18_7']	前生諸惑至於今生，已得果故勢力虧損，其相不明似無明品，故唯前世惑可說無明聲。	前生諸惑至於今生，已得果故勢力虧損，其相不明似無明品，故唯前世惑可說無明聲。	The various passions of a previous life, having reached the present life and having already obtained a fruit, are weakened in power, and their characteristics are unclear, resembling the class of ignorance. Therefore only the passions of a previous life can be said to be the sound of ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c19_9']	非於行中亦應同此說假立名想，唯於同類故。	非於行中亦應同此說假立名想，唯於同類故。	It should not be said that the same is true of the name and concept of the designation of the members of the present life. It is only in the same class.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c20_9']	於宿生中福等業位至今果熟，總名為行。	於宿生中福等業位至今果熟，總名為行。	In a previous life, the state of action such as merit, etc., reaches the present life and ripens into a fruit, and in general it is called action.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c20_18']	初句位言流至老死。	初句位言流至老死。	The word state in the first phrase extends to old age and death.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c21_10']	福等諸業相，業品當廣辯。	福等諸業相，業品當廣辯。	The characteristics of the actions of merit, etc., will be broadly discussed in the chapter on action.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c22_1']	何緣此宿業獨名為行？	何緣此宿業獨名為行？	Why is this previous action alone called action?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c22_7']	名隨義立故。	名隨義立故。	Because the name is established according to the meaning.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c22_12']	其義云何？	其義云何？	What is the meaning?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c23_11']	謂依眾緣和合已起，惑展轉力和合已生。	謂依眾緣和合已起，惑展轉力和合已生。	It means that having relied on the combination of conditions, it arises. The various passions arise having relied on the combination of the power of the self and the combination of conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c25_2']	又能為緣已令果和合，或此和合已能為果緣，是謂行名所隨實義。	又能為緣已令果和合，或此和合已能為果緣，是謂行名所隨實義。	Also, it is able to act as a condition and cause the fruit to combine, or having combined, it is able to act as a condition for the fruit. This is the real meaning that is followed by the name action.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c26_19']	宿生中業果今熟者，行相圓滿獨立行名，由此已遮來生果業，以彼業果仍未熟故。	宿生中業果今熟者，行相圓滿獨立行名，由此已遮來生果業，以彼業果仍未熟故。	If the results of actions in previous lives have matured, the characteristics are complete and it is called an action independently. This excludes actions whose results will be experienced in future lives, because the results of those actions have not yet matured.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c28_16']	相未圓滿不立行名，豈不一切已與自果異熟因體皆具此相，即應一切皆立行名？	相未圓滿不立行名，豈不一切已與自果異熟因體皆具此相，即應一切皆立行名？	If the characteristics are not complete, it is not called an action. Aren’t all causes whose results have already been experienced characterized in this way? Then all of them should be called actions.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c29_3']	此體是何？	此體是何？	What is the substance of this action?
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0840c29_12']	謂諸非業及業前生。	謂諸非業及業前生。	It is all that is not action and all that is prior to action.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0841a01_18']	已得果者雖有此理，而就勝說業為異熟因，牽果最勝故。	已得果者雖有此理，而就勝說業為異熟因，牽果最勝故。	Although this principle applies to that which has already experienced its results, still, because it is the most excellent in attracting results, action is said to be the cause of results.
['ZH_T29_1563_014:0841a03_12']	現在生業果麁顯易知，故因此能信知過去生果業，是故唯此獨立行名。	現在生業果麁顯易知，故因此能信知過去生果業，是故唯此獨立行名。	Because the results of present and past actions are gross and obvious and easy to know, one can believe in and know the actions whose results are experienced in future lives. Therefore, only this is called an action independently.

For this reason, it is said that before the state of six sense bases there is the state of name-and-form. This explanation is correct.

The body consciousness also arises in the stage of name and form. How much more so in the stage of the six sense bases! You say that the three kinds of contact do not exist, but the other consciousnesses may still arise.
