Because of this, the function of this sutra has the previous four flavors. By contemplating this sutra, one achieves wonderful practice, beginning and end, the meaning of the six identities and four ones is revealed. Therefore, the four explanations accomplish the present four ones. How much more so for the vast, lofty, and long that pervades the four explanations?

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b10_8']	次心法妙意者，《大論》云：	次心法妙意者，《大論》云：	004	Next, the meaning of the wonderful Dharma of the mind. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says:
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b11_11']	「眾生心性猶如利刀，唯用割泥，泥無所成，刀日就損。	「眾生心性猶如利刀，唯用割泥，泥無所成，刀日就損。	004	The nature of sentient beings' minds is like a sharp knife, only used to cut mud. The mud does not accomplish anything, but the knife is damaged day by day.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b12_1']	」理體常妙，眾生自麁。	」理體常妙，眾生自麁。	004	The essence of truth is always wonderful, but sentient beings are coarse by themselves.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b14_3']	初引《安樂行》中既云「觀一切法，不為生死所動，不為煩惱所退」，以煩惱生死是法界故。	初引《安樂行》中既云「觀一切法，不為生死所動，不為煩惱所退」，以煩惱生死是法界故。	004	First, citing the Practice of Peace and Bliss, it says, Contemplating all dharmas, not moved by birth and death, not retreating due to afflictions, because afflictions and birth and death are the dharma realm.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b14_19']	又「一念心隨喜」等者，即觀行位。	又「一念心隨喜」等者，即觀行位。	004	A single thought of joyful acceptance and so forth refer to the stage of contemplation.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b16_11']	初秖於貪瞋一念心起，體即權實，諸皆例然，隨順三諦，故云「隨喜」。	初秖於貪瞋一念心起，體即權實，諸皆例然，隨順三諦，故云「隨喜」。	004	At the beginning, one merely contemplates the arising of a single thought of greed or anger, which is essentially provisional and real. All other dharmas are the same. One accords with the three truths, therefore it is called joyful acceptance.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b16_20']	是故隨喜名心法妙。	是故隨喜名心法妙。	004	Therefore, joyful acceptance is called the marvelous dharma of the mind.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b19_5']	《普賢觀》意者，心體即理故云「自空」，誰執罪福故云「無主」，應遍十界以明罪福，在一念心方成妙觀。	《普賢觀》意者，心體即理故云「自空」，誰執罪福故云「無主」，應遍十界以明罪福，在一念心方成妙觀。	004	The meaning of the Samantabhadra Contemplation Sutra is that the essence of the mind is principle, therefore it is called empty by itself. Who grasps at sin and merit? Therefore it is called without a master. It should pervade the ten dharma realms to clarify sin and merit. Only in a single thought can one accomplish the marvelous contemplation.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b20_8']	「觀心無心」等者，能緣之心既無，所緣之法安在？	「觀心無心」等者，能緣之心既無，所緣之法安在？	004	Contemplating the mind without mind and so forth means that since the mind that can be contemplated does not exist, how can the dharma that is contemplated exist?
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b21_14']	能所不二，故云「純是」，以心體本妙，故可於心行而求解脫。	能所不二，故云「純是」，以心體本妙，故可於心行而求解脫。	004	The subject and object are not two, therefore it is called pure. Since the essence of the mind is originally marvelous, one can seek liberation within the activities of the mind.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b22_9']	破心微塵如《止觀》第三記。	破心微塵如《止觀》第三記。	004	The destruction of the subtle dust of the mind is as explained in the third record of the Śamathavipaśyanā.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b26_7']	初略明得名所依，言「若廣眾生法一往通論諸因果及一切法」等者，然眾生義通故云「通論」。	初略明得名所依，言「若廣眾生法一往通論諸因果及一切法」等者，然眾生義通故云「通論」。	004	First, briefly clarifying the basis for the name. It says If the sentient beings' dharma is broadly discussed in a general way, it includes all causes and effects as well as all dharmas. The meaning of sentient beings is inclusive, therefore it says general discussion.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b27_2']	若其通論，義非究竟，故云「一往」。	若其通論，義非究竟，故云「一往」。	004	If it is a general discussion, the meaning is not ultimate, therefore it says in a general way.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b28_1']	一往雖通，二往則局，不通於佛，及唯在因。	一往雖通，二往則局，不通於佛，及唯在因。	004	Although in a general way it is inclusive, in a specific way it is exclusive and does not extend to the Buddha, and is only in the causes.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b29_15']	佛法及心不云一往者，佛法定在於果，心法定在於因，故此三法得名各別。	佛法及心不云一往者，佛法定在於果，心法定在於因，故此三法得名各別。	004	The Buddha's dharma and the mind do not say in a general way. The Buddha's dharma is definitely in the effect, and the mind dharma is definitely in the causes. Therefore, these three dharmas have different names.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839b29_18', 'ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c02_4']	何者？🔽如眾生身中佛法心法猶通因果，況眾生名通通凡通聖？	何者？ 如眾生身中佛法心法猶通因果，況眾生名通通凡通聖？	004	What are they?🔽For example, in the body of a sentient being, the Buddha's dharma and the mind dharma still include causes and effects, let alone the name sentient being which is inclusive and extends to both ordinary and holy beings.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c03_13']	若佛身中眾生心法亦定在果，心法之中佛法眾生法此二在因。	若佛身中眾生心法亦定在果，心法之中佛法眾生法此二在因。	004	If in the body of a Buddha, the mind dharma of sentient beings is also definitely in the effect, within the mind dharma, the Buddha's dharma and the dharma of sentient beings, these two are in the causes.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c04_8']	若爾，何故經云「三無差別」？	若爾，何故經云「三無差別」？	004	If so, why does the sutra say the three are no different?

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c05_16']	理體無差，差約事用，此義廣明，具如《止觀》十法成乘中說。	理體無差，差約事用，此義廣明，具如《止觀》十法成乘中說。	004	The principle body is without difference, the difference is based on the functioning of events. This meaning is explained in detail in the ten dharmas that constitute the vehicle in the Calming and Insight.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c07_11']	即是心法及眾生法，彼佛法界亦兼於果而不專於果，彼文寄果明理性故也。	即是心法及眾生法，彼佛法界亦兼於果而不專於果，彼文寄果明理性故也。	004	This is the dharma of the mind and the dharma of sentient beings. The Buddha Dharma realm also includes the fruit, but is not exclusive to the fruit. That text uses the fruit to illustrate the principle of nature.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c08_1']	次正廣釋中自三：	次正廣釋中自三：	004	Next, in the extensive explanation, there are three parts:

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c10_1']	初通論諸經增數，次正約今經。	初通論諸經增數，次正約今經。	004	First, discussing the increased numbers in various sutras, and next, specifically discussing the present sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c13_7']	初通諸經者，此中釋法唯立三門釋妙則本迹各十，且如下文通釋妙數中云「本迹三中一一各十，十中復各待絕不同，故有一百二十重妙」。	初通諸經者，此中釋法唯立三門釋妙則本迹各十，且如下文通釋妙數中云「本迹三中一一各十，十中復各待絕不同，故有一百二十重妙」。	004	First, regarding various sutras, in this explanation of the dharma, only three gates are established. In explaining the wonderful, each of the本迹 has ten. For example, in the explanation of the wonderful numbers below, it says In each of the three of本迹, there are ten each. Within the ten, there are also differences in the relative and absolute, thus there are one hundred and twenty layers of wonderful.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c15_14']	當知諸經所列法數，一往且從增數而說，據其道理須論四教，四教之中皆有迹中三十麁法、三十妙法。	當知諸經所列法數，一往且從增數而說，據其道理須論四教，四教之中皆有迹中三十麁法、三十妙法。	004	It should be known that the enumeration of dharmas listed in various sūtras is generally spoken of according to increasing numbers, but according to their principles, they must be discussed in terms of the four teachings. Within the four teachings, there are all thirty coarse dharmas and thirty wondrous dharmas in the traces.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c17_17']	更約五味以論麁妙，兼但對帶，依此等法而生增數，始從一法乃至百千，不出心佛眾生法故。	更約五味以論麁妙，兼但對帶，依此等法而生增數，始從一法乃至百千，不出心佛眾生法故。	004	Furthermore, using the five flavors to discuss the coarse and wondrous, along with the mere, corresponding, and attached, based on these dharmas, the increasing numbers arise, starting from one dharma up to a hundred thousand, but they do not go beyond the mind, Buddha, sentient beings, and dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0839c18_13']	增數之相略如《止觀》第六記。	增數之相略如《止觀》第六記。	004	The characteristics of increasing numbers are roughly like those in the sixth record of the Mohe Zhiguan.

The thirty-three bodies of Avalokitesvara and Wonderful Sound are all texts of sages having the provisional.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0840a10_14']	「如此抑沒」等者，抑凡無實、沒聖無權。	「如此抑沒」等者，抑凡無實、沒聖無權。	004	As for Such suppression and submergence, etc., it suppresses ordinary beings as having no reality and submerges sages as having no provisional.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0840a15_10']	若且約界判，則九界為權、佛界為實，一一界中又各具十，尚權實相即，何況具耶？	若且約界判，則九界為權、佛界為實，一一界中又各具十，尚權實相即，何況具耶？	004	If we provisionally discuss it in terms of realms, then the nine realms are provisional and the Buddha realm is real. Within each realm, there are also ten realms each. The provisional and real are still mutually inclusive, let alone being replete with each other?
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0840a16_8']	一心既爾，諸心例然，是故不同舊人所見。	一心既爾，諸心例然，是故不同舊人所見。	004	Since the one mind is like this, all minds are the same. Therefore, it is different from the views of the old masters.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0840a18_18']	四釋十法界名約三諦者，具如《止觀》第五記。	四釋十法界名約三諦者，具如《止觀》第五記。	004	The fourth explanation of the names of the ten dharma realms in terms of the three truths is fully discussed in the fifth record of the Mohe Zhiguan.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0840a20_9']	如無別體全依於界，前釋本末等已約三諦即是十界皆三諦竟。	如無別體全依於界，前釋本末等已約三諦即是十界皆三諦竟。	004	Suchness has no separate essence and is entirely based on the realms. The previous explanation of the primary and secondary, etc., is already in terms of the three truths, which is the same as the ten realms all being the three truths.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0840a22_14']	今重明者，按「十法界」三字解義，使十界中三諦分明，則令如中三諦復顯，彼此相成，令知不異。	今重明者，按「十法界」三字解義，使十界中三諦分明，則令如中三諦復顯，彼此相成，令知不異。	004	Now, to clarify this again, by analyzing the meaning of the three characters ten dharma realms, making the three truths in the ten realms clear, it causes the three truths in the middle to be revealed again, with each supporting the other, making one understand that they are not different.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0840a24_7']	故《止觀》中不思議境一念三千，非思量分別之所能解，是故立此不思議名。	故《止觀》中不思議境一念三千，非思量分別之所能解，是故立此不思議名。	004	Therefore, in the Zhiguan (Mohe Zhiguan), the inconceivable realm of a single thought of the three thousand is not something that can be understood through deliberation and discrimination. For this reason, this inconceivable name is established.

Therefore, ordinary beings who have the fruit definitely have retribution. If the people of the two vehicles are also generally called fruits, they cannot discuss retribution, because in their teachings it is not said that the two vehicles have a place of rebirth.

Then, those with the undefiled as the cause still use the original name, and are therefore called the undefiled as the cause giving rise to the land of expedient means.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0842a07_13']	今初釋菩薩報亦但名菩薩者，以菩薩中得八相佛，復通權實，權非佛界之因、實方招於佛報，是故須分三教菩薩屬菩薩界，圓教菩薩即屬佛界。	今初釋菩薩報亦但名菩薩者，以菩薩中得八相佛，復通權實，權非佛界之因、實方招於佛報，是故須分三教菩薩屬菩薩界，圓教菩薩即屬佛界。	004	Now, in the initial explanation of the retribution of bodhisattvas, they are still only called bodhisattvas, because among the bodhisattvas there are those who attain the eight aspects of a buddha, and they also include the provisional and the real. The provisional is not the cause of the realm of buddhas, while the real attracts the retribution of a buddha.

The meaning of not yet severing the separate delusions corresponds to entering emptiness. According to the analogy, the ten abodes of the separate teaching should be in the middle. Because these five people have no meaning of subduing the separate delusions, and the aspiration of the aroused mind is different, they form a category of their own.

As for subduing the separate delusions, this refers to the ten dedications and the ten practices and ten abodes. The meaning of the ten practices corresponds to emerging from emptiness. This is the dust-sand and ignorance that together form the separate delusions. Even if one severs the dust-sand, one only subdues ignorance. It is also only called subdued. Therefore, the thirty people of the separate teaching are all called subdued.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a08_6']	遍在諸位，故云「通途」。	遍在諸位，故云「通途」。	004	It is present in all stages, thus it is called general.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a10_1']	所言「分」者，以下後文釋報究竟在佛，故下地為分，以報名通故，故下地定十。	所言「分」者，以下後文釋報究竟在佛，故下地為分，以報名通故，故下地定十。	004	As for the term part, it is because the text below explains that the ultimate reward is in the Buddha, thus the lower grounds are called parts. Since the name reward is general, therefore the ten rewards are in the lower grounds.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a12_4']	此中所引諸文皆通云「報」，唯《大經》文云「無上報」，既其初後皆云「分得」，當知「無上」之言亦是望下。	此中所引諸文皆通云「報」，唯《大經》文云「無上報」，既其初後皆云「分得」，當知「無上」之言亦是望下。	004	The various texts quoted here all generally say reward, only the text of the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says unsurpassed reward. Since it says partial attainment at the beginning and end, one should know that the word unsurpassed also refers to the lower grounds.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a13_14']	次《攝大乘》下釋下地有報所以，先引論，次「何者」下釋有生滅。	次《攝大乘》下釋下地有報所以，先引論，次「何者」下釋有生滅。	004	Next, the commentary below the Compendium of the Great Vehicle explains why the lower grounds have retribution. First, it cites the treatise, and then below What is... it explains the existence of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a15_13']	初文中言「就佛界亦九亦十」者，通途為語，從初地去皆屬佛界，地地有報，故定具十。	初文中言「就佛界亦九亦十」者，通途為語，從初地去皆屬佛界，地地有報，故定具十。	004	In the initial text, it says In the Buddha realm, it is both nine and ten. This is a general statement. Starting from the first ground, all belong to the Buddha realm. Each ground has retribution, so it definitely possesses ten.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a16_20']	故引此經，《大經》、《仁王》、《攝論》並論初住已上文也。	故引此經，《大經》、《仁王》、《攝論》並論初住已上文也。	004	Therefore, this sutra, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, the Benevolent Kings Sūtra, and the Compendium of the Great Vehicle all discuss the text above the initial abode.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a19_3']	既云生死，秖是生滅。	既云生死，秖是生滅。	004	Since it says birth and death, it is just arising and ceasing.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a21_14']	初正釋中二重者，前約智斷為生滅，次「又殘」下全約惑邊以論生滅。	初正釋中二重者，前約智斷為生滅，次「又殘」下全約惑邊以論生滅。	004	In the initial correct explanation, there are two layers. The first is based on wisdom and elimination as arising and ceasing, and the next is based entirely on the side of afflictions to discuss arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a22_15']	次引《大論》中有喻有合，喻中耘如滅，種如生；	次引《大論》中有喻有合，喻中耘如滅，種如生；	004	Next, citing the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra has a metaphor and a combination. In the metaphor, weeding is like elimination, and seeds are like arising;
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a22_19']	合可見。	合可見。	004	The combination can be seen.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a23_15']	又增道損生亦如生滅，生故感報也。	又增道損生亦如生滅，生故感報也。	004	Moreover, increasing the path and reducing birth is also like arising and ceasing. Because of birth, one receives retribution.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a25_4']	次從「若就」去別約妙覺位「亦九亦十」者，損生義足是故唯九；	次從「若就」去別約妙覺位「亦九亦十」者，損生義足是故唯九；	004	Next, from If we discuss onwards, specifically discussing the stage of wondrous enlightenment. It is both nine and ten means that the meaning of reducing birth is complete, so it is only nine;
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a25_19']	約現生後，既有現報，亦可為十。	約現生後，既有現報，亦可為十。	004	In terms of present birth and future, since there is present retribution, it can also be ten.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a27_2']	如《大纓珞》慧眼菩薩問文殊，具如《止觀》第五記。	如《大纓珞》慧眼菩薩問文殊，具如《止觀》第五記。	004	Like the Great Entwining, Bodhisattva of Wisdom Eye asked Mañjuśrī, which is fully recorded in the fifth note of the Śamathavipaśyanā.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843a28_14']	「三十生盡等大覺」者，有本云「四十生盡」「四十一生盡」等，並誤也。	「三十生盡等大覺」者，有本云「四十生盡」「四十一生盡」等，並誤也。	004	When the thirty births are exhausted, one is equal to the Great Awakened One - some texts say when the forty births are exhausted or when the forty-one births are exhausted and so on, but these are all errors.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b01_20']	言「三十」者，《仁王經》中一一地中分為三品，即以一品為一生，《仁王經》中不立等覺，故三十生盡即入妙覺。	言「三十」者，《仁王經》中一一地中分為三品，即以一品為一生，《仁王經》中不立等覺，故三十生盡即入妙覺。	004	As for thirty, in the Renwang Jing, each stage is divided into three grades, with each grade being considered one lifetime. The Renwang Jing does not establish the stage of enlightenment, so when the thirty lifetimes are exhausted, one enters the wondrous enlightenment.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b03_3']	他不見之，便以四十位或四十一位為四十生等。	他不見之，便以四十位或四十一位為四十生等。	004	Others, not seeing this, take the forty positions or forty-one positions as the forty lifetimes, etc.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b04_13']	「又約現生後論九論十」者，有現報故名為有報，無生後故亦言無報。	「又約現生後論九論十」者，有現報故名為有報，無生後故亦言無報。	004	Also, in terms of the present life and the next, it is discussed in nine ways or ten ways means that because there is a present retribution, it is called having retribution, and because there is no retribution in the next life, it is also said to be without retribution.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b06_8']	始自初入變易土中，受法性身，既並無復隔生之義，故無生後二種報也。	始自初入變易土中，受法性身，既並無復隔生之義，故無生後二種報也。	004	Starting from the initial entry into the transformed land and receiving the Dharma-nature body, since there is no more meaning of being separated by lifetimes, there are no two kinds of retribution in the next life.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b06_21']	故《涅槃》中〈純陀品〉云：	故《涅槃》中〈純陀品〉云：	004	Therefore, in the Nirvana Sutra's chapter on Cunda, it says:
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b08_2']	「我今所獻食，願得無上報」，是則報中無上不過於佛。	「我今所獻食，願得無上報」，是則報中無上不過於佛。	004	The food I now offer, I wish to attain the unsurpassed retribution. This means that within retribution, nothing surpasses the Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b11_3']	「何者」下并四復次作所表釋佛報無上，復引《賢聖集》釋五文意，復約五味判《賢聖集》意，故至法華方名無上，稱歎之意良有以也。	「何者」下并四復次作所表釋佛報無上，復引《賢聖集》釋五文意，復約五味判《賢聖集》意，故至法華方名無上，稱歎之意良有以也。	004	What is it? and below, along with four further explanations, makes a provisional explanation of the Buddha's unsurpassed reward. It also cites the Xian Sheng Ji to explain the meaning of the five texts, and further divides the meaning of the Xian Sheng Ji according to the five flavors. Therefore, it is only called unsurpassed in the Lotus Sutra. The meaning of the praise is indeed reasonable.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b13_1']	「賢聖集意」者，亦如《俱舍》云「下無升見上」，例知二乘下智不了上智，非正遍知。	「賢聖集意」者，亦如《俱舍》云「下無升見上」，例知二乘下智不了上智，非正遍知。	004	The meaning of the Xian Sheng Ji is also like the Treatise on the Treasury of Abhidharma saying those below do not see those above. It can be known that the lower wisdom of the two vehicles does not understand the higher wisdom, and is not the correct and all-encompassing knowledge.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b14_17']	約五味中，初約乳云「或入即假或入即中」者，依《中論》偈，汎用即名其實。	約五味中，初約乳云「或入即假或入即中」者，依《中論》偈，汎用即名其實。	004	In the five flavors, the first uses milk to say either entering the provisional or entering the middle. It relies on the verses of the Treatise on the Middle Way and generally uses the name immediate.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b15_9']	華嚴二教未即、機緣未合故著。	華嚴二教未即、機緣未合故著。	004	The two teachings of the Flower Ornament Sutra are not immediate, and the conditions of the teachings are not yet united, so they are attached.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b16_11']	或言部中雖有無上之教，為帶別故部非無上；	或言部中雖有無上之教，為帶別故部非無上；	004	Some say that although there is the teaching of the unsurpassed in the sutra, it is accompanied by the separate teaching, so the sutra is not unsurpassed;

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b20_6']	「復次」下開權者，至《法華經》復有二種入妙不同，引入及按位入故也。	「復次」下開權者，至《法華經》復有二種入妙不同，引入及按位入故也。	004	Next, below, opening the provisional means that up to the Lotus Sutra there are also two kinds of entry into the wonderful that are different, namely entering by introduction and entering by pressing the position.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b21_13']	言「又按其性相不論引入」者，如從伏位來入伏位，名為按位。	言「又按其性相不論引入」者，如從伏位來入伏位，名為按位。	004	It is said that pressing its nature and characteristics, without discussing introduction, such as coming from the position of subduing and entering the position of subduing, is called pressing the position.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b22_9']	從伏惑位入斷惑位，名為引入。	從伏惑位入斷惑位，名為引入。	004	From the position of subduing delusions, entering the position of severing delusions, is called introduction.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b23_11']	今不論引入，當位即妙，妙體稱本，無隔異故。	今不論引入，當位即妙，妙體稱本，無隔異故。	004	Now, without discussing introduction, the present position is precisely wonderful. The wonderful essence accords with the original, without any separation.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b25_18']	云「縱橫甚多」者，於一一界各具十法故名為「橫」，按次第起名之為「縱」。	云「縱橫甚多」者，於一一界各具十法故名為「橫」，按次第起名之為「縱」。	004	It is said that the vertical and horizontal are very many because each of the individual realms possesses ten dharmas, which is called horizontal. Pressing the sequence and arising is called vertical.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b29_1']	雖若縱若橫無非三諦，故知實非縱橫義言縱橫，雖非縱橫，以交互起不可分別，故雖千萬起不可分別，若以下文諸意結之則令可識。	雖若縱若橫無非三諦，故知實非縱橫義言縱橫，雖非縱橫，以交互起不可分別，故雖千萬起不可分別，若以下文諸意結之則令可識。	004	Although in terms of both vertical and horizontal, they are all the three truths, we should know that the meaning of vertical and horizontal is not truly vertical and horizontal. Although not vertical and horizontal, they arise alternately and cannot be distinguished. Therefore, although they arise a thousand times, they cannot be distinguished. If we conclude with the various meanings in the following text, it will make them recognizable.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843b29_7']	次正結中二：	次正結中二：	004	Next, in the correct conclusion, there are two parts:

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843c06_16']	《中論》偈意本是一實不可思議遍申諸經，故今用結百界千如以成一心稱一切教，故云「攝得前多」。	《中論》偈意本是一實不可思議遍申諸經，故今用結百界千如以成一心稱一切教，故云「攝得前多」。	004	The meaning of the verses in the Middle Treatise is originally one inconceivable reality that pervades all sutras, so now it is used to conclude the hundred realms and thousand suchnesses to form one mind, conforming to all teachings, so it is said to include the many before.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843c09_2']	《大經》偈云「通教同稱無常」者，未見常理故，別教次第滅於生滅，先內次外，佛界一切眾生即滅盡定。	《大經》偈云「通教同稱無常」者，未見常理故，別教次第滅於生滅，先內次外，佛界一切眾生即滅盡定。	004	The verse in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says the common teaching is called impermanence because they have not yet seen the principle of permanence. The separate teaching gradually extinguishes birth and cessation, first internally and then externally. The Buddha realm and all sentient beings are the samādhi of complete cessation.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843c10_4']	「又生」下重釋者，別教登地亦得寂滅，故須此釋也。	「又生」下重釋者，別教登地亦得寂滅，故須此釋也。	004	The repeated explanation below the word again is because the separate teaching's stage of entering the grounds also attains quiescence and cessation, so this explanation is necessary.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0843c11_15']	「七佛通戒偈」者，過現諸佛皆用此偈以為略戒，遍攝諸戒故名為通。	「七佛通戒偈」者，過現諸佛皆用此偈以為略戒，遍攝諸戒故名為通。	004	The verse on the common precepts of the seven buddhas means that the buddhas of the past and present all use this verse as a brief precept, which universally includes all precepts, so it is called common.

The method of transformation does not go beyond manifesting the body and expounding the Dharma, therefore it uses these two to clarify self and other, therefore one should know that it just uses the perspective of the fruition to clarify the Buddha Dharma.

Now it says the nature of the mind is called the supreme concentration, therefore the words the nature of the mind are very brief, one should understand that this nature is replete with Buddhadharmas and sentient beings' dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844a12_13']	雖復具足，心性冥妙不一不多，以心性觀則似可見；	雖復具足，心性冥妙不一不多，以心性觀則似可見；	004	Although it is replete, the profound and wondrous nature of the mind is neither one nor many. If one contemplates with the nature of the mind, it seems as if it can be seen;

One cannot further conceive of the one who roams and the place roamed. This essence of the Dharma realm is ultimately empty, so it is called like space.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844a27_12']	法本無名假立心佛，故云「即假」。	法本無名假立心佛，故云「即假」。	004	The Dharma originally has no name, but provisionally establishes the mind and Buddha, so it is called provisional.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b05_18']	次重釋諸佛境界者，遍法界故，故云「上等佛法下等眾生法」。	次重釋諸佛境界者，遍法界故，故云「上等佛法下等眾生法」。	004	Next, the repeated explanation of the realm of all buddhas is because it pervades the Dharma realm, therefore it is said that above it is equal to the Dharma of buddhas, below it is equal to the Dharma of sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b07_3']	次重釋心者，眾生及佛不出於心，故無差別，名心法妙。	次重釋心者，眾生及佛不出於心，故無差別，名心法妙。	004	Next, the repeated explanation of mind is because sentient beings and buddhas are not apart from the mind, therefore there is no distinction, and it is called the wonderful Dharma of the mind.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b07_17']	是故結歸三無差別，方名為妙。	是故結歸三無差別，方名為妙。	004	Therefore, it is concluded that the three are no different from each other, and only then are they called wonderful.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b11_2']	佛果已滿何須復云百界千法？	佛果已滿何須復云百界千法？	004	Since the fruition of buddhahood is already complete, why is it necessary to say again that it is a hundred realms and a thousand dharmas?
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b11_11']	已云心法即餘二故。	已云心法即餘二故。	004	It is already said that the Dharma of the mind is the other two.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b13_7']	若不問餘二，心法之二既其不妙，却令心法亦未為妙，故知義言應兼問二。	若不問餘二，心法之二既其不妙，却令心法亦未為妙，故知義言應兼問二。	004	If one does not ask about the other two, since the two dharmas of the mind are not subtle, it will cause the mind dharma to also not be subtle. Therefore, it should be known that the meaning refers to also asking about the two.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b13_18']	具如《止觀》不思議境。	具如《止觀》不思議境。	004	It is like the inconceivable realm in the Mohe Zhiguan.

If one misses this meaning, when explaining the ten wondrous petals, the wondrous will turn into the coarse. Up to the end of the seventh fascicle, the same purport is expressed.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b21_15']	又更略引小乘名通，以示其相，如《中含》第三，諸比丘歎舍利子所說妙中之妙，然舍利子但說事中行忍，是巧方便不損他境，名妙中妙。	又更略引小乘名通，以示其相，如《中含》第三，諸比丘歎舍利子所說妙中之妙，然舍利子但說事中行忍，是巧方便不損他境，名妙中妙。	004	Moreover, it is briefly quoted that the name of the Hinayana is common, to show its characteristics. Like the third of the Madhyama Agama, the bhikṣus praise Śāriputra's explanation as the most wondrous among the wondrous. However, Śāriputra only explained the practice of forbearance in things, which is skillful means without harming other realms, called the most wondrous among the wondrous.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b23_3']	又四十三，佛告諸比丘，莫求欲樂極下賤法為凡夫行；	又四十三，佛告諸比丘，莫求欲樂極下賤法為凡夫行；	004	Moreover, in the forty-third [chapter], the Buddha told the bhikṣus not to seek the pleasures of desire, which is the extreme of the foolish;
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844b24_17']	亦莫自苦，苦非聖行，離此二邊則有中道成於眼智，歷一切法，皆悉如是。	亦莫自苦，苦非聖行，離此二邊則有中道成於眼智，歷一切法，皆悉如是。	004	nor should one torment oneself, as that is not the practice of the sages. Departing from these two extremes, there is the middle way that gives rise to the eye of wisdom, and this applies to all dharmas, all of which are like this.

Therefore, the explanations of the various wonders now use the two to crown the beginning. Therefore, in the traces approach, each of the ten wonders opens up many sub-topics, none of which are not explained in two ways.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0844c13_7']	言「更無非待非絕」等者，理性實是非待非絕，秖向待絕約理論二，不同雙非二邊更有中道之理。	言「更無非待非絕」等者，理性實是非待非絕，秖向待絕約理論二，不同雙非二邊更有中道之理。	004	As for the phrase there is no more non-dependence and non-extinction, the principle of reality is truly non-dependent and non-extinct. It is only in terms of the theories of dependence and extinction that the two are distinguished. It is not the same as the principle of the middle way that exists apart from the two extremes of non-dependence and non-extinction.

This principle of dependence and extinction has already destroyed ignorance and has already revealed the middle way.

Although the Distinct Teaching sometimes enters through the stages before the grounds, it still needs to be adjusted by the two flavors of raw and ripe milk. Therefore, these two flavors are also called skillful means.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845a22_12']	云「方等帶生蘇論妙以待麁」者，二乘鈍根於方等中得生蘇益，帶此益故以論圓妙；	云「方等帶生蘇論妙以待麁」者，二乘鈍根於方等中得生蘇益，帶此益故以論圓妙；	004	As for the Vaipulya [sutras] using raw milk to discuss the wonderful in order to wait for the coarse, the dull faculties of the two vehicles obtain the benefits of raw milk in the Vaipulya [sutras].

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845b06_8']	通教中根帶於即空、下根帶假，別教亦然，是故皆麁。	通教中根帶於即空、下根帶假，別教亦然，是故皆麁。	004	In the general teaching, the middle-level faculty still has emptiness, and the lower-level faculty still has provisional positing. The specific teaching is also like this, so they are all coarse.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845b07_2']	言「直通」者，空即假中，是故名妙。	言「直通」者，空即假中，是故名妙。	004	He says directly penetrating means that emptiness is provisional positing and the middle, so it is called subtle.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845b08_2']	此亦是判未得名開，開無復麁，空假皆妙。	此亦是判未得名開，開無復麁，空假皆妙。	004	This is also the distinction of what has not yet been attained being called opening. In opening, there is no more coarseness. Emptiness and provisional are all wonderful.

Since the meaning is already mixed, how can this be understood?
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845b12_15']	答意者，滿名雖同不無差別，故作四航之譬，以解五味之譬。	答意者，滿名雖同不無差別，故作四航之譬，以解五味之譬。	004	The meaning of the answer is that although the name full is the same, there are still differences. Therefore, the analogy of the four boats is used to explain the analogy of the five flavors.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845b13_14', 'ZH_T33_1717_004:0845b15_5']	四航之中三官一私，雖同名官不無差別。🔽教門亦爾，通雖名滿，所通處近如至中洲，別圓通遠如至彼岸。	四航之中三官一私，雖同名官不無差別。 教門亦爾，通雖名滿，所通處近如至中洲，別圓通遠如至彼岸。	004	Among the four boats, three are official and one is private.

['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845c28_19']	「若法為待成」者，待麁而得妙。	「若法為待成」者，待麁而得妙。	004	Next, the Zhong lun is cited to corroborate the present text. If a dharma is formed through dependence means that through dependence on the coarse, the subtle is obtained.
['ZH_T33_1717_004:0845c29_12']	「是法還成待」者，是妙還成待。	「是法還成待」者，是妙還成待。	004	This dharma still forms dependence means that the subtle still forms dependence.

Dependence refers to dependent origination, therefore it is only the absence of dependence. Therefore, it quotes the absence to prove the present sutra. Holding the absence and the wonderful are both in the Lotus Sutra, which is also not greatly different. Due to dependence, one knows the wonderful. The essence of the wonderful is the absence. The absence also has no reliance. The essence of the wonderful is non-dual. The meaning of the Huayan text is also the same as this.

This is to clarify that the three kinds of wondrous are only called wondrous in the Lotus Sutra, therefore the two kinds of wondrous are used to make the three kinds of wondrous dharmas wondrous. Therefore, although the other teachings have perfect and harmonious [dharmas], they are completely devoid of the two kinds of wondrous, and the three [kinds of wondrous dharmas] are already made wondrous. Therefore, the above text says, This wondrous is the Dharma, and this Dharma is wondrous, therefore the three dharmas all have ten, forming thirty kinds of wondrous. This is precisely why.

Using this both being absolute, it is called provisional in comparison to the previous. The provisional has not yet been subsumed, and only when subsumed is it called absolute. Therefore, this part obtains the name of the two kinds of wondrous.

Therefore, it is said that although the traces and the origin are different, they are inconceivably one. Because they are one and yet different, we should know that merely citing the distant and near is not yet understanding the contemplation of the mind. The distant and near are themselves distant and near. What do they have to do with me?
