['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191b25_1']	而今開異，義小殊耳。	而今開異，義小殊耳。	025	But now it is opened differently, with only a slight difference in meaning.
['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191b25_12']	故了謂照了，不通於生。	故了謂照了，不通於生。	025	Therefore, understanding refers to illumination and does not extend to generation.
['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191b26_2']	緣謂眾緣，義通生了。	緣謂眾緣，義通生了。	025	Conditions refer to various conditions and their meaning extends to both generation and understanding.

['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191b27_12']	如不可生，故但名了。	如不可生，故但名了。	025	Because it cannot be generated, it is only called understanding.

['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191c02_4']	一空者，所謂生死。	一空者，所謂生死。	025	The first empty refers to birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191c02_14']	不空者，是謂大涅槃。	不空者，是謂大涅槃。	025	Not empty refers to great nirvāṇa.

['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191c07_13']	此二不二，是真平等，悟法性空是真如故。	此二不二，是真平等，悟法性空是真如故。	025	These two are non-dual, which is true equality, because realizing the emptiness of dharmas is true suchness.
['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191c09_1']	經云「汝已嚴淨此法身」者，對上真如，即是法身出障名淨。	經云「汝已嚴淨此法身」者，對上真如，即是法身出障名淨。	025	The sutra says You have already purified this Dharma body - in contrast to the above true suchness, it is the Dharma body that is called pure when free from obstructions.
['ZH_T36_1736_025:0191c09_17']	「因華行滿」是已莊嚴，易故不釋。	「因華行滿」是已莊嚴，易故不釋。	025	Because the practice of the cause is fulfilled is the adornment that has already been accomplished, it is easy and therefore not explained.
