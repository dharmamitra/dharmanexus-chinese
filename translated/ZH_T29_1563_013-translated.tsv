['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834a29_11']	死後生前有自體起，具足五蘊為至生處，在二有中，故名中有。	死後生前有自體起，具足五蘊為至生處，在二有中，故名中有。	013	After death and before birth, there arises a self-body endowed with the five aggregates to reach the place of birth, and is in the middle between the two existences, therefore it is called intermediate existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b01_4']	如何此有體有起歿而不名生？	如何此有體有起歿而不名生？	013	How is it that this existence has arising and perishing but is not called birth?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b01_18']	又此有身為從業得、為自體有？	又此有身為從業得、為自體有？	013	Also, does this existence arise from karma or does it exist by itself?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b02_19']	從業得者，此應名生，業為生因，契經說故。	從業得者，此應名生，業為生因，契經說故。	013	If it arises from karma, it should be called birth, because karma is the cause of birth, as the scriptures say.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b03_18']	自體有者，此應無因，則同無因外道論失。	自體有者，此應無因，則同無因外道論失。	013	If it exists by itself, it should have no cause, and then fall into the error of the non-Buddhists who claim that things arise without a cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b04_7']	是故中有應即名生。	是故中有應即名生。	013	Therefore the intermediate existence should be called birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b05_6']	生謂當來所應至處，依所至義建立生名。	生謂當來所應至處，依所至義建立生名。	013	Birth is the place to which one should go in the future. The name birth is established on the basis of the meaning of arriving at that place.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b06_6']	此中有身，體雖起歿而未至彼，故不名生。	此中有身，體雖起歿而未至彼，故不名生。	013	This intermediate existence, although its body arises and perishes, has not yet arrived there, and therefore it is not called birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b07_13']	體謂此中異熟五蘊，此但名起不說為生，死生有中暫時起故。	體謂此中異熟五蘊，此但名起不說為生，死生有中暫時起故。	013	The body refers to the five aggregates of karmic retribution in this intermediate existence. It is only called arising and not called birth, because it arises temporarily in the intermediate existence between death and birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b08_13']	或復生者是所趣義，中有能趣，所以非生。	或復生者是所趣義，中有能趣，所以非生。	013	Or, moreover, birth means the meaning of that to which one goes. The intermediate existence is able to go there, and therefore it is not birth.

['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b09_7']	謂業所引異熟五蘊。	謂業所引異熟五蘊。	013	It refers to the five aggregates of karmic retribution that are attracted by karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b10_14']	究竟分明以業為生因，契經說故，此應名生者，其理不然。	究竟分明以業為生因，契經說故，此應名生者，其理不然。	013	The ultimate and clear cause of birth is karma, because it is explained in the sutras. This should be called birth, but that principle is not correct.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b11_9']	不說業為因皆名為生，故契經說：	不說業為因皆名為生，故契經說：	013	It is not said that all causes of karma are called birth, and therefore the sutra explains:
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b12_9']	有補特伽羅，已斷生結、起結未斷，廣說四句。	有補特伽羅，已斷生結、起結未斷，廣說四句。	013	There is a person who has already severed the bond of birth but has not yet severed the bond of arising. The four phrases are explained in detail.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b14_2']	由是准知，有順中有非生有業，此業所得不說為生，故與彼經無相違失。	由是准知，有順中有非生有業，此業所得不說為生，故與彼經無相違失。	013	Therefore, it is understood that there is karma in the intermediate state that is conducive to rebirth, but the results of this karma are not called rebirth. Therefore, there is no contradiction with that sūtra.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b15_1']	此既與生同一業引，如何中有名起非生？	此既與生同一業引，如何中有名起非生？	013	Since this [intermediate existence] is attracted by the same karma as rebirth, how is it called arising in the intermediate state but not rebirth?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b15_19']	豈不前說所至所趣乃說為生，中有不爾。	豈不前說所至所趣乃說為生，中有不爾。	013	Isn't it said before that the place one reaches and goes to is called rebirth, but intermediate existence is not like that?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b17_7']	又一業果多故無失，如一念業有多念果，一無色業色無色果。	又一業果多故無失，如一念業有多念果，一無色業色無色果。	013	Moreover, there is no fault because the result of one karma is multiple. Just as one moment of karma has many moments of result, and one formless realm karma has form and formless realm results.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b18_7']	如是一業所引之果，有生有起，理何相違？	如是一業所引之果，有生有起，理何相違？	013	In the same way, how is there any contradiction in the principle that the result attracted by one karma has rebirth and arising?

['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834b29_0']	從一生多故，　　非相續二生，	從一生多故，　　非相續二生，	013	Because one gives rise to many, therefore it is not born from the two of a continuous series,

['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c02_2']	論曰：	論曰：	013	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c02_11']	且由理故中有非無。	且由理故中有非無。	013	Moreover, because of reasoning, there is no intermediate state.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c03_9']	中有若無，應定非有從餘處歿餘處續生。	中有若無，應定非有從餘處歿餘處續生。	013	If there were no intermediate state, one would definitely not exist, passing away from one place and continuing birth in another place.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c04_8']	未見世間相續轉法，處雖有間而可續生。	未見世間相續轉法，處雖有間而可續生。	013	One has not seen in the world a dharma that continues and transforms, where even though there is an interval in place, one can continue to be born.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c06_6']	既許有情從餘處歿生於餘處，則定應許中間連續中有非無，譬如世間穀等相續。	既許有情從餘處歿生於餘處，則定應許中間連續中有非無，譬如世間穀等相續。	013	Since you admit that sentient beings die in one place and are born in another, you must also admit that there is a continuous intermediate existence, just as there is a continuity of grain, for example.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c07_5']	現見穀等餘處續生，必於中間處無間斷。	現見穀等餘處續生，必於中間處無間斷。	013	We see that grain, etc., is born in another place, but it does not occur without a break in continuity in the interval.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c08_13']	故有情類相續亦然，剎那續生處必無間，是故中有實有義成。	故有情類相續亦然，剎那續生處必無間，是故中有實有義成。	013	The continuity of sentient beings is also like this. Birth in another place is without a break in continuity in the interval. Therefore intermediate existence really exists.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c10_2']	豈不世間亦見有色，處雖間斷而得續生，如鏡等中從質生像。	豈不世間亦見有色，處雖間斷而得續生，如鏡等中從質生像。	013	Is it not also seen in the world that form is born in another place without a break in continuity in the interval, as when an image is born in a mirror, etc., from a substance?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c10_11']	死生二有理亦應然。	死生二有理亦應然。	013	The principle of death and birth must also be like this.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c11_19']	我許質依中間有物，連續無斷諸像方生，故於其中亦無間斷。	我許質依中間有物，連續無斷諸像方生，故於其中亦無間斷。	013	We admit that the substance that is the support has a thing in the interval that is continuous and without a break, and then the image is born. Therefore there is no break in continuity in the interval.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c13_16']	謂月面等大種，恒時法爾能生，清妙大種無間遍至，現對所依在所皆生似本像色。	謂月面等大種，恒時法爾能生，清妙大種無間遍至，現對所依在所皆生似本像色。	013	That is, the primary elements of the moon, the face, etc., are always able to produce primary elements that are clear and wonderful, which are born in the place of the support without a break in continuity and resemble the original form.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c16_13']	依若清徹像顯易知，依若麁穢像隱難了，雖二中間亦有像色，由清妙故在依方顯，如日光等雖復遍生，在壁等依方現可見。	依若清徹像顯易知，依若麁穢像隱難了，雖二中間亦有像色，由清妙故在依方顯，如日光等雖復遍生，在壁等依方現可見。	013	If the basis is clear and transparent, the reflection is easy to perceive. If the basis is coarse and turbid, the reflection is hidden and difficult to perceive. Although there is also reflected form in between the two, because it is clear and subtle, it is only manifest in the basis, just like sunlight, although it is produced everywhere, is only manifest and visible when in a basis such as a wall.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c17_3']	如何知像連質而生？	如何知像連質而生？	013	How do we know that a reflection is produced in continuity with its substance?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c17_12']	中間有隔像不生故。	中間有隔像不生故。	013	Because if there is an obstruction in between, a reflection is not produced.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c19_1']	謂若月等中無連續，於水等中能生像者，中間有隔像亦應生。	謂若月等中無連續，於水等中能生像者，中間有隔像亦應生。	013	If there were no continuity between the moon, etc., and the water, etc., a reflection would also be produced even if there were an obstruction in between.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c21_16']	如彼所宗執無中有餘處蘊滅餘處蘊生，又像形容屈申俯仰及往來等隨本質故，由斯證像連質而生，不可引為遮中有喻。	如彼所宗執無中有餘處蘊滅餘處蘊生，又像形容屈申俯仰及往來等隨本質故，由斯證像連質而生，不可引為遮中有喻。	013	Just as in their system, they maintain that the aggregates do not cease in one place and arise in another place without an intermediate state. Also, because the form of a reflection bends, stretches, inclines, raises, and moves back and forth, etc., in accordance with the substance, this proves that a reflection is produced in continuity with its substance. It cannot be cited as an example to refute an intermediate state.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c23_1']	然經主等一類諸師，許像不成故非譬者，彼說非理。	然經主等一類諸師，許像不成故非譬者，彼說非理。	013	However, the author of the commentary and other teachers maintain that a reflection is not a valid example because it is not established. They say that this is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c24_5', 'ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c26_3']	像非不成，對別現生如是像故，猶如此像本質所依。🔽謂鏡等中鏡等現質為依緣故，有隨所依本質像起分明可得，像所緣質實有極成。	像非不成，對別現生如是像故，猶如此像本質所依。 謂鏡等中鏡等現質為依緣故，有隨所依本質像起分明可得，像所緣質實有極成。	013	The image is not unreal, because it appears in dependence on something else, just as the image does in dependence on the original object.🔽That is, in a mirror, etc., the image appears in dependence on the original object in the mirror, etc., and it is clearly perceived in dependence on the original object. It is generally agreed that the original object that is the objective condition of the image really exists.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c28_10']	此像為緣，於別鏡等亦有隨質，所依像起分明可得，故知前像緣起像故實有義成，由是應知諸像實有。	此像為緣，於別鏡等亦有隨質，所依像起分明可得，故知前像緣起像故實有義成，由是應知諸像實有。	013	In dependence on this image as a condition, another image also arises in dependence on another mirror, etc., and it is clearly perceived. Therefore, we know that the former image exists as a real entity because it is the condition for the arising of the latter image. Consequently, you must admit that images are real.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0834c29_1']	此若無者，餘像何緣？	此若無者，餘像何緣？	013	If they are unreal, what is the condition for the arising of the other images?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a01_19']	若言前像所緣本質為此緣者，理亦不然，前質不對後所依故，後像不隨前質起故。	若言前像所緣本質為此緣者，理亦不然，前質不對後所依故，後像不隨前質起故。	013	If you claim that the original object that is the objective condition of the former image is the condition for the latter image, that is not reasonable, because the former object is not present in the support of the latter image and because the latter image does not arise in dependence on the former object.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a03_7']	謂後所依，唯對前像不對前質，如何可說前質為緣現於後像？	謂後所依，唯對前像不對前質，如何可說前質為緣現於後像？	013	That is, the support of the latter image only faces the former image and does not face the former object. How can you claim that the former object is the condition for the arising of the latter image?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a05_5']	曾未見有背鏡等質於鏡等中為緣現像，由斯後像不隨前質，但隨前像其理極成。	曾未見有背鏡等質於鏡等中為緣現像，由斯後像不隨前質，但隨前像其理極成。	013	We have never seen a back side of a mirror or other reflecting medium that is the condition for the appearance of a reflection. Therefore, the later reflection does not follow the earlier object, but only the earlier reflection. This principle is completely established.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a05_14']	復如何知像體實有？	復如何知像體實有？	013	How do we know that the substance of a reflection really exists?
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a06_4']	由像不越實有相故。	由像不越實有相故。	013	Because a reflection does not violate the characteristics of real existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a07_12']	謂若不越眼等識境，皆是實有後當成立，像既可見故知實有。	謂若不越眼等識境，皆是實有後當成立，像既可見故知實有。	013	If it does not violate the objects of visual consciousness, etc., it must be real, as will be established later. Since a reflection can be seen, we know that it must be real.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a08_2']	又像有時而可得故。	又像有時而可得故。	013	Also, a reflection sometimes can be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a09_1']	此若無者，應一切時定不可得、或常可得。	此若無者，應一切時定不可得、或常可得。	013	If it did not exist, it would never be obtainable, or it would always be obtainable.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a10_16']	若謂有時可不可得，由所待緣合不合者，是則應知餘有為法於緣合位實有義成。	若謂有時可不可得，由所待緣合不合者，是則應知餘有為法於緣合位實有義成。	013	If it is said that sometimes it can be obtained and sometimes not because of the coming together or not of the necessary conditions, then you must understand that other conditioned dharmas are really existent when the necessary conditions come together.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a12_7']	又像能遮餘色生故，謂像能礙餘像色生，於自所居障餘生故。	又像能遮餘色生故，謂像能礙餘像色生，於自所居障餘生故。	013	Also, because a reflection can block the arising of other colors. That is, a reflection can obstruct the arising of other reflected colors, because it blocks the arising of others in its own location.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a14_6']	又無分別識所緣故，謂五識身所緣境界實有極成，然像既通眼識所得，故知實有。	又無分別識所緣故，謂五識身所緣境界實有極成，然像既通眼識所得，故知實有。	013	Also, because it is the object of nondiscriminative consciousness, that is, the objects of the five material consciousnesses are really existent and universally recognized. However, the image is perceived by visual consciousness, and therefore it is known to be real.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a15_13']	若法隨具如前相者，當知彼法實有極成，此像既然故知實有。	若法隨具如前相者，當知彼法實有極成，此像既然故知實有。	013	If a dharma is endowed with the above characteristics, it should be known that it is real and universally recognized. Since the image is like this, it is known to be real.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a16_13']	然經主等立像無因，謂一處所無二並故。	然經主等立像無因，謂一處所無二並故。	013	However, the Śāstra master and others establish the nonexistence of the image, saying that two things do not exist in the same place.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a18_3']	彼謂一處鏡色及像並見現前，二色不應同處並有，依異大故。	彼謂一處鏡色及像並見現前，二色不應同處並有，依異大故。	013	They say that in one place, the color of the mirror and the image are both seen in front of one, and two colors should not exist in the same place, because they depend on different elements.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a19_3', 'ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a20_11']	又挾水上兩岸色形，同處一時俱現二像。🔽居兩岸者互見分明，曾無一處並見二色，不應謂此二色俱生。	又挾水上兩岸色形，同處一時俱現二像。 居兩岸者互見分明，曾無一處並見二色，不應謂此二色俱生。	013	Also, the colors of the two banks of a body of water appear in the same place and at the same time as two images.🔽Those on the two banks see them clearly, and never see two colors in the same place. It should not be said that these two colors exist simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1563_013:0835a22_8']	又影與光未甞同處，然曾見鏡懸置影中，光像顯然現於鏡面，不應於此謂二並生。	又影與光未甞同處，然曾見鏡懸置影中，光像顯然現於鏡面，不應於此謂二並生。	013	Also, shadows and light never exist in the same place.

It is like mica and other things that are extremely close to the colors they separate: one perceives them as being in the same place.
