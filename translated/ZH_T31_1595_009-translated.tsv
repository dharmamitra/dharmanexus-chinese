['ZH_T31_1595_009:0216b01_5']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The explanation is as follows:
['ZH_T31_1595_009:0216b03_6']	施由戒故清淨，若人不持戒，身口意業則不清淨，所行之施亦不清淨，以依止不清淨故；	施由戒故清淨，若人不持戒，身口意業則不清淨，所行之施亦不清淨，以依止不清淨故；	Giving is purified by morality. If a person does not uphold morality, their bodily, verbal, and mental actions will not be pure, and the giving they practice will also be impure, because it is based on impurity.
['ZH_T31_1595_009:0216b04_2']	由能持戒，依止清淨故，施得清淨。	由能持戒，依止清淨故，施得清淨。	By being able to uphold morality, the basis becomes pure, and giving becomes pure.

['ZH_T31_1595_009:0216b06_2']	忍由精進故清淨，以精進能生善滅惡故。	忍由精進故清淨，以精進能生善滅惡故。	Patience is purified by vigor. This is because vigor can give rise to good and eliminate evil.
['ZH_T31_1595_009:0216b07_6']	精進由定故清淨，若精進不在修位則不能除惑故。	精進由定故清淨，若精進不在修位則不能除惑故。	Vigor is purified by concentration. If vigor is not in the state of cultivation, it cannot eliminate afflictions.
['ZH_T31_1595_009:0216b08_16']	定由智慧故清淨，若不了別真如，雖復得定，以有流故即生死法；	定由智慧故清淨，若不了別真如，雖復得定，以有流故即生死法；	Concentration is purified by wisdom. If one does not discern true suchness, even if one attains concentration, it is still a dharma of birth and death because it has outflows;
['ZH_T31_1595_009:0216b09_14']	若見真如所得之定則成無流，為涅槃道。	若見真如所得之定則成無流，為涅槃道。	If one sees true suchness and attains concentration, it becomes without outflows and becomes the path to nirvāṇa.
