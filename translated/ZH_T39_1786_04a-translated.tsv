The first states arises from the combination of various causes and conditions and earth, water, fire, and wind combine to form and establish, while the latter states when the water, fire, and wind elements disperse and perish. How could this not be the arising and ceasing of the four elements?
['ZH_T39_1786_04a:0129c26_5']	而言生滅皆從種無明者，彰此生滅不離迷妄也。	而言生滅皆從種無明者，彰此生滅不離迷妄也。	04a	As for saying that arising and ceasing all come from the ignorance of seeds, this shows that this arising and ceasing is not apart from deluded confusion.
['ZH_T39_1786_04a:0129c28_10']	故前生云妄想故起，至後滅云散滅壞時此乃死支，合云憂悲苦惱，斯是無明之果，復是無明之因。	故前生云妄想故起，至後滅云散滅壞時此乃死支，合云憂悲苦惱，斯是無明之果，復是無明之因。	04a	Therefore, the previous arising states arises due to delusion, and the subsequent ceasing states when dispersing and perishing. This is the stage of death, which should be combined with worry, sorrow, suffering, and distress. This is the effect of ignorance and also the cause of ignorance.
['ZH_T39_1786_04a:0129c29_3']	故論云「老死有果，所謂無明。	故論云「老死有果，所謂無明。	04a	Therefore, the treatise states: Old age and death have effects, which are called ignorance.

The shared teaching clarifies that the four great elements are originally empty by nature, thus they are originally non-arising and non-ceasing. Due to ignorance, one sees arising and ceasing, like the arising of an illusion and the ceasing of an illusion.
['ZH_T39_1786_04a:0130a07_4']	別教四大，體是佛性，由無明故四大生滅，性無生滅、相有生滅。	別教四大，體是佛性，由無明故四大生滅，性無生滅、相有生滅。	04a	The distinct teaching clarifies that the four great elements are the Buddha-nature. Due to ignorance, the four great elements arise and cease, but the nature is non-arising and non-ceasing, while the characteristics have arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T39_1786_04a:0130a10_5']	圓教四大，體亦佛性，而性本具九界四大，故九四大若生若滅皆是法界，是故性相俱不生滅，乃不思議論生滅也，故《法華》明世間相常。	圓教四大，體亦佛性，而性本具九界四大，故九四大若生若滅皆是法界，是故性相俱不生滅，乃不思議論生滅也，故《法華》明世間相常。	04a	The perfect teaching clarifies that the four great elements are also the Buddha-nature, and the nature originally possesses the four great elements of the nine realms. Therefore, whether the four great elements of the nine realms arise or cease, they are all the Dharma realm. Thus, the nature and characteristics are both non-arising and non-ceasing, which is the inconceivable discussion of arising and ceasing. Therefore, the Lotus Sutra clarifies that the characteristics of the world are constant.
