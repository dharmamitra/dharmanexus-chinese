['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299a26_0']	將說此經，十門分別：初述大意、次辨宗致、三	將說此經，十門分別：初述大意、次辨宗致、三	001	Before explaining this sutra, it is analyzed in ten aspects: First, stating the general meaning; second, discerning the main purport; third,
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299a29_5']	二藏是非、四三經同異、五生身處所、六出世時節、七二世有無、八三會增減、九發心久近、十證果前後。	二藏是非、四三經同異、五生身處所、六出世時節、七二世有無、八三會增減、九發心久近、十證果前後。	001	the distinction between the two canons; fourth, the similarities and differences between the three sutras; fifth, the place of birth; sixth, the time of appearance in the world; seventh, the presence or absence in the two worlds; eighth, the increase or decrease in the three assemblies; ninth, the length of time since arousing the aspiration for enlightenment; tenth, the sequence of attaining Buddhahood.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b05_2']	第一述大意者，蓋聞彌勒菩薩之為人也，遠近莫量、深淺莫測，無始無終、非心非色，天地不能載其功、宇宙不能容其德，八聖未甞窺其𨓍、七辨無足談其極，窈窈冥冥、非言非默者乎。	第一述大意者，蓋聞彌勒菩薩之為人也，遠近莫量、深淺莫測，無始無終、非心非色，天地不能載其功、宇宙不能容其德，八聖未甞窺其𨓍、七辨無足談其極，窈窈冥冥、非言非默者乎。	001	The first, stating the general meaning, is this: I have heard that the person of Maitreya Bodhisattva is immeasurable in distance, unfathomable in depth, without beginning or end, neither mind nor form. Heaven and earth cannot contain his merit, the universe cannot encompass his virtue. The eight noble ones have never glimpsed his essence, the seven abilities are insufficient to discuss his ultimate. He is profound and obscure, neither speaking nor silent.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b07_12']	然不周之山之高其跡可跋、朝夕之池之深其疆可涉，是知至人之玄猶有可尋之跡、玄德之遼非無可□之行。	然不周之山之高其跡可跋、朝夕之池之深其疆可涉，是知至人之玄猶有可尋之跡、玄德之遼非無可□之行。	001	However, the high mountains that are not complete have traces that can be climbed, and the vastness of the morning and evening pools can be crossed. This shows that the profundity of the sages still has traces that can be sought, and the vastness of the mysterious virtues is not without practices that can be followed.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b08_9']	今隨跡疆之近蹤，誠論始終之遠趣。	今隨跡疆之近蹤，誠論始終之遠趣。	001	Now, following the traces and vastness of the recent tracks, truly discussing the distant goal of beginning and end.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b11_2']	言其始也，感慈定之光熾、發廣度之道心，浴八解之清流、息□覺之苑林，四等之情等閏四生、三明之慧明導三界。	言其始也，感慈定之光熾、發廣度之道心，浴八解之清流、息□覺之苑林，四等之情等閏四生、三明之慧明導三界。	001	Speaking of its beginning, feeling the light of compassionate concentration flourishing, giving rise to the mind of the way of extensive liberation, bathing in the clear stream of the eight liberations, resting in the garden grove of enlightenment, the feelings of the four equalities equally nourishing the four kinds of birth, the wisdom of the three insights illuminating and guiding the three realms.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b14_4']	論其終也，度苦海於法雲、發等覺於長夢，却二障之重闇、照四智之明鏡，乘六通之實車、遊八極之曠野，千應萬化之術事啻百億□□□。	論其終也，度苦海於法雲、發等覺於長夢，却二障之重闇、照四智之明鏡，乘六通之實車、遊八極之曠野，千應萬化之術事啻百億□□□。	001	Discussing its end, crossing the sea of suffering in the Dharma cloud, giving rise to equal enlightenment in the long dream, turning away the heavy darkness of the two hindrances, illuminating the bright mirror of the four knowledges, riding the real chariot of the six spiritual powers, wandering in the vast wilderness of the eight directions, the techniques of a thousand responses and myriad transformations are more than a hundred koṭīs of merits and virtues.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b15_11']	今此經者，斯乃略歎至人垂天之妙迹、勸物修觀之真典也。	今此經者，斯乃略歎至人垂天之妙迹、勸物修觀之真典也。	001	Now, this sutra is a brief praise of the subtle traces of the Sage who has descended from heaven, and an exhortation to cultivate the true canon of contemplation.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b16_17']	彌勒菩薩者，此云慈氏覺士，賢劫千佛之內是其□□如來。	彌勒菩薩者，此云慈氏覺士，賢劫千佛之內是其□□如來。	001	Maitreya Bodhisattva, which means Compassionate One, is the Buddha of the Worthy Kalpa among the thousand Buddhas.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b18_17']	弗沙佛時無習慈定，熏修其心遂成常性，從此已來每稱慈氏，乃至成佛猶立是名也。	弗沙佛時無習慈定，熏修其心遂成常性，從此已來每稱慈氏，乃至成佛猶立是名也。	001	During the time of Buddha Phussa, he had not yet cultivated the meditation on compassion, but by perfuming and cultivating his mind, he eventually attained a constant nature. From then on, he was always called Maitreya, and even when he became a Buddha, he still retained this name.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b22_1']	兜率陀者，譯言知足，欲界六天之中是其第四□□□□、欲情重，上二浮、逸心多，此第四天，欲輕逸少、非沈非浮，莫蕩於塵，故名知足。	兜率陀者，譯言知足，欲界六天之中是其第四□□□□、欲情重，上二浮、逸心多，此第四天，欲輕逸少、非沈非浮，莫蕩於塵，故名知足。	001	Tuṣita Heaven is translated as Contentment. Among the six heavens of the desire realm, it is the fourth heaven. The beings in the lower two heavens are too attached to desires, and those in the upper two are too frivolous and distracted. The beings in this fourth heaven have less attachment to desires and are neither depressed nor floating, so they are not swayed by worldly affairs, thus it is called Contentment.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b23_1']	□受用具，不待營作、隨念自然，故名為天。	□受用具，不待營作、隨念自然，故名為天。	001	They enjoy all the necessary things without having to work for them, as they appear spontaneously just by being thought of, so they are called gods.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b23_13']	菩薩從人昇天，故曰上生。	菩薩從人昇天，故曰上生。	001	The Bodhisattva ascends to heaven from the human realm, so it is called ascending birth.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b24_4']	行者靜慮思察，名之為觀。	行者靜慮思察，名之為觀。	001	Practitioners contemplate in meditative absorption, which is called contemplation.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b25_11']	聞金口、演玉句，澍法雨之沃閏、成佛種之華菓，故言佛說。	聞金口、演玉句，澍法雨之沃閏、成佛種之華菓，故言佛說。	001	Hearing the golden mouth expound the jade phrases, pouring down the nourishing rain of Dharma, producing the flowers and fruits of Buddha-nature, therefore it is said spoken by the Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b27_13']	若人受持此經、觀察彼天，則能生妙樂之淨處，承慈氏之至人，登無退之聖階、謝有死之凡塵。	若人受持此經、觀察彼天，則能生妙樂之淨處，承慈氏之至人，登無退之聖階、謝有死之凡塵。	001	If a person upholds this sūtra and contemplates that heaven, they will be able to be born in the pure place of wondrous bliss, receive the supreme person Maitreya, ascend the noble stage of non-retrogression, and leave behind the ordinary dust of death.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299b29_4']	舉是大意，以標題目，故言佛說觀彌勒菩薩上生兜率陀天經云云。	舉是大意，以標題目，故言佛說觀彌勒菩薩上生兜率陀天經云云。	001	Raising the great meaning to mark the title, therefore it is said Sūtra Spoken by the Buddha on Contemplating Bodhisattva Maitreya's Rebirth in Tuṣita Heaven and so forth.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c02_17']	次第二明經宗致者，此經正以觀行因果而為其宗，令人生天、永無退轉以為意致。	次第二明經宗致者，此經正以觀行因果而為其宗，令人生天、永無退轉以為意致。	001	Next, the second point clarifies the purport of the sūtra. The main purport of this sūtra is the cause and effect of contemplation practice, with the intention of causing people to be born in the heavens and never retrogress.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c03_7']	所言觀者，有其二種：	所言觀者，有其二種：	001	What is meant by contemplation has two aspects:
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c04_5']	一觀彼天依報莊嚴、二觀菩薩正報殊勝。	一觀彼天依報莊嚴、二觀菩薩正報殊勝。	001	First, contemplating the adornments of the heavens' dependent environment; second, contemplating the excellence of the bodhisattva's own body.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c04_15']	專念觀察，故名三昧；	專念觀察，故名三昧；	001	Single-mindedly contemplating and observing, it is called samādhi;
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c05_4']	而非修慧，唯在聞思。	而非修慧，唯在聞思。	001	But it is not the wisdom cultivated through practice, but only through hearing and contemplation.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c06_4']	此但名為電光三昧，而無輕安，是欲界因也。	此但名為電光三昧，而無輕安，是欲界因也。	001	This is only called the lightning samadhi, but without lightness and comfort, it is the cause of the desire realm.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c06_14']	所言行者，略有三種：	所言行者，略有三種：	001	There are roughly three kinds of practitioners mentioned:
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c07_10']	一者聞大慈名，敬心悔前所作之罪；	一者聞大慈名，敬心悔前所作之罪；	001	The first is hearing the name of great kindness and repenting with a respectful mind for the previous misdeeds committed;
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c08_6']	二者聞慈氏名，仰信此名所表之德；	二者聞慈氏名，仰信此名所表之德；	001	The second is hearing Maitreya's name and looking up to believe in the virtues represented by this name;
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c09_10']	三者行於掃塔塗地、香華供養等諸事業，如下文說。	三者行於掃塔塗地、香華供養等諸事業，如下文說。	001	The third is practicing such activities as sweeping stupas, smearing the ground with mud, and making offerings of incense and flowers, as explained below in the text.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c10_8']	此觀此行合為一根，所生之果略有四種：	此觀此行合為一根，所生之果略有四種：	001	These contemplations and practices together form one root, and the fruits produced are roughly of four kinds:
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c12_6']	一者牙莖離土之果、二者華葉蔭涼之果、三者妙華開敷之果、四者芳菓成就之果。	一者牙莖離土之果、二者華葉蔭涼之果、三者妙華開敷之果、四者芳菓成就之果。	001	The first is the fruit of the sprouts and stems being separated from the soil, the second is the fruit of the flowers and leaves providing shade and coolness, the third is the fruit of the wonderful flowers blooming, and the fourth is the fruit of the fragrant fruits being perfected.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c13_14']	第一牙莖離土果者，伏滅前來所作眾罪，是因初行所得果也。	第一牙莖離土果者，伏滅前來所作眾罪，是因初行所得果也。	001	As for the first fruit of the sprouts and stems being separated from the soil, it is the subduing and extinguishing of the various misdeeds committed in the past. This is the fruit obtained by the initial practice of the cause.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c15_3']	第二華葉蔭涼果者，不墮三途邊地耶見，因第二行所得果也。	第二華葉蔭涼果者，不墮三途邊地耶見，因第二行所得果也。	001	The second fruit of the shade of the flower leaves means not falling into the three evil paths, borderlands, or wrong views, which is the fruit obtained from the second practice.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c16_11']	第三妙華開敷果者，謂得兜率依正妙報，因第三行之所得也。	第三妙華開敷果者，謂得兜率依正妙報，因第三行之所得也。	001	The third fruit of the blooming of the wonderful flower means obtaining the wonderful rewards of Tuṣita Heaven, which is obtained from the third practice.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c17_19']	第四芳菓成就果者，於無上道得不退轉，依前二觀之所得也。	第四芳菓成就果者，於無上道得不退轉，依前二觀之所得也。	001	The fourth fruit of the accomplishment of fragrant fruits means attaining irreversibility in the unsurpassed path, which is obtained from the previous two contemplations.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c20_2']	所以然者，觀察菩薩依正報故，生彼天時親承聖導，永不退於阿耨菩提，故依二觀得第四果。	所以然者，觀察菩薩依正報故，生彼天時親承聖導，永不退於阿耨菩提，故依二觀得第四果。	001	The reason for this is that by contemplating the rewards of the bodhisattvas' dependent origination, when one is born in that heaven one personally receives the guidance of the sages and never retrogresses from supreme perfect enlightenment. Therefore, one obtains the fourth fruit by relying on the two contemplations.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c22_4']	由聞慈氏之名、信其仁賢之德，遠離不聞賢聖名處，恒隨正見、成就眷屬，故依聞名得第二果。	由聞慈氏之名、信其仁賢之德，遠離不聞賢聖名處，恒隨正見、成就眷屬，故依聞名得第二果。	001	By hearing the name of Maitreya and believing in his benevolent and virtuous qualities, one is far removed from places where one does not hear the names of the sages, always following right views and accomplishing one's retinue. Therefore, one obtains the second fruit by relying on hearing the name.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c22_14']	餘二因果，相當可知。	餘二因果，相當可知。	001	The other two causes and fruits can be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c24_4']	知是觀行因果成就，無上菩提自然而至，是謂上生之果之所致也。	知是觀行因果成就，無上菩提自然而至，是謂上生之果之所致也。	001	Knowing that this is the accomplishment of the causes and effects of contemplation practice, the unsurpassed enlightenment naturally arrives. This is called the attainment of the fruit of rebirth above.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c25_14']	次第三明二藏是非者，諸說不同。	次第三明二藏是非者，諸說不同。	001	Next, the third explanation of the right and wrong of the two treasuries is that there are different opinions.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c26_13']	或有說者，此上生經是小乘教，聲聞藏攝。	或有說者，此上生經是小乘教，聲聞藏攝。	001	Some say that this Sutra of Rebirth Above is a teaching of the Lesser Vehicle, included in the Sravaka Treasury.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c28_11']	所以然者，說阿逸多具凡夫身、未斷諸漏，又說彼果為十善報，以之故知非大乘教。	所以然者，說阿逸多具凡夫身、未斷諸漏，又說彼果為十善報，以之故知非大乘教。	001	The reason for this is that it says that Ajita has the body of an ordinary person and has not yet eliminated the defilements, and it also says that the fruit of rebirth above is the reward for the ten wholesome deeds. For this reason, it is known to be not a teaching of the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0299c29_19']	或有說者，此經正是大乘之教，菩薩藏收，略以四文而證此義。	或有說者，此經正是大乘之教，菩薩藏收，略以四文而證此義。	001	Some say that this sutra is precisely a teaching of the Great Vehicle, included in the Bodhisattva Treasury. It is briefly proven by four passages.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a02_5']	一者《智度論》說「聲聞藏中無菩薩眾，猶如川流不容大海。	一者《智度論》說「聲聞藏中無菩薩眾，猶如川流不容大海。	001	First, the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says: In the Sravaka Treasury there are no bodhisattvas, just as a stream does not contain a great ocean.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a03_8']	菩薩藏中有菩薩眾及聲聞眾，猶如大海容於眾流。	菩薩藏中有菩薩眾及聲聞眾，猶如大海容於眾流。	001	In the Bodhisattva Treasury there are bodhisattvas and sravakas, just as a great ocean contains many streams.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a04_12']	」今此經中既有聲聞及菩薩眾，故知是大而非小也。	」今此經中既有聲聞及菩薩眾，故知是大而非小也。	001	Since this sutra has both shravakas and bodhisattvas, it is known to be Mahayana and not Hinayana.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a06_5']	《金剛般若》序中雖無初菩薩眾，後流通分列菩薩眾，是故不應以彼作難。	《金剛般若》序中雖無初菩薩眾，後流通分列菩薩眾，是故不應以彼作難。	001	Although the preface to the Diamond Prajna Paramita Sutra does not mention the initial assembly of bodhisattvas, the distribution section lists bodhisattvas, so it should not be used as a challenge.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a07_17']	二者經下文中說「牢度大神禮十方佛發弘誓願」，故知是大而非小也。	二者經下文中說「牢度大神禮十方佛發弘誓願」，故知是大而非小也。	001	Second, the text below says that the great god Rama bowed to the Buddhas of the ten directions and made a great vow, so it is known to be Mahayana and not Hinayana.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a08_8']	以小乘教中無十方佛故。	以小乘教中無十方佛故。	001	Because there are no Buddhas of the ten directions in the teachings of Hinayana.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a11_13']	三者下文說言「晝夜六時常說不退轉地法輪之行，逕一時中成就五百億天子令不退於阿耨菩提」，此言實非小乘教所容，故知是大而非小也。	三者下文說言「晝夜六時常說不退轉地法輪之行，逕一時中成就五百億天子令不退於阿耨菩提」，此言實非小乘教所容，故知是大而非小也。	001	Third, the text below says, At the six times of the day and night, he always expounds the practice of the irreversible stage of the Dharma wheel, and in one period of time he accomplishes five hundred koṭis of heavenly beings, causing them to be irreversible from supreme perfect enlightenment. These words are truly not contained in the teachings of Hinayana, so it is known to be Mahayana and not Hinayana.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a13_7']	四者聞說是經，他方來會十萬菩薩得首楞嚴三昧，八萬億諸天發菩提心。	四者聞說是經，他方來會十萬菩薩得首楞嚴三昧，八萬億諸天發菩提心。	001	Fourth, having heard this sutra, one hundred thousand bodhisattvas from other directions came to the assembly and attained the samadhi of shoulengyan, and eighty koṭis of heavenly beings gave rise to the aspiration for enlightenment.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a14_7']	准此得益菩薩行願，故知所聞是大乘教也。	准此得益菩薩行願，故知所聞是大乘教也。	001	According to this, the benefits and bodhisattva practices and vows are obtained. Therefore, it is known that what is heard is the Mahāyāna teaching.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a14_10']	評曰：	評曰：	001	The commentator says:
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a17_7']	此教通被大小根性，如言「愛敬無上菩提心者欲為彌勒作弟子者」，乃至廣說，故但小不容大、大能含小，故隨所宗，菩薩藏攝。	此教通被大小根性，如言「愛敬無上菩提心者欲為彌勒作弟子者」，乃至廣說，故但小不容大、大能含小，故隨所宗，菩薩藏攝。	001	This teaching is universally given to those with small and large capacities. As it is said, Those who love and respect the unsurpassed bodhi mind and wish to be disciples of Maitreya, and so on, it is explained in detail. Therefore, only the small cannot accommodate the large, but the large can contain the small. Therefore, according to the school, it is included in the Bodhisattva Canon.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a17_16']	所以後師所說是也。	所以後師所說是也。	001	This is why the later master's explanation is so.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a17_18']	問：	問：	001	Question:
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a18_11']	若如後說，初所引文云何和會？	若如後說，初所引文云何和會？	001	If it is as explained later, how is the text quoted at the beginning reconciled?
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a18_14']	解云：	解云：	001	The explanation says:
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a19_13']	所言具凡夫身等者，是舉小乘所執釋作問。	所言具凡夫身等者，是舉小乘所執釋作問。	001	As for the phrase endowed with the body of an ordinary person, it raises the question by citing the small vehicle's attachment.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a21_19']	而答文言身圓光中有首楞嚴三昧波若波羅蜜字義炳然者，是表菩薩位登十地，以此三昧在彼地故。	而答文言身圓光中有首楞嚴三昧波若波羅蜜字義炳然者，是表菩薩位登十地，以此三昧在彼地故。	001	But the answer says, The letters of the śūraṃgama samādhi and prajñā-pāramitā are clearly manifest within the body's halo, which indicates that the bodhisattva's stage has ascended to the ten grounds, because this samādhi is in those grounds.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a23_7']	又言十善報應者，欲明菩薩十善之報實遍十方，非直在此。	又言十善報應者，欲明菩薩十善之報實遍十方，非直在此。	001	Moreover, as for the ten wholesome deeds and their retributions, it clarifies that the retribution for the bodhisattva's ten wholesome deeds is truly universal throughout the ten directions, not just here.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a24_5']	但應物機，局示彼天，以之故言十善報應。	但應物機，局示彼天，以之故言十善報應。	001	But in response to beings' capacities, it specifically shows that heaven, and for that reason it speaks of the retribution for the ten wholesome deeds.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a24_15']	由是道理，彌合大教。	由是道理，彌合大教。	001	For this reason, it greatly accords with the great teaching.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a27_15']	如下文言「若我住世一小劫中，應說一生補處菩薩報應及十善果者，不能窮盡」，故知非直十善果義說名報應，亦示以淨報應於物機。	如下文言「若我住世一小劫中，應說一生補處菩薩報應及十善果者，不能窮盡」，故知非直十善果義說名報應，亦示以淨報應於物機。	001	As the text below says, If I were to dwell in the world for a small kalpa, and were to explain the retribution for the bodhisattva who is one life away from Buddhahood and the fruits of the ten wholesome deeds, I would not be able to exhaust it, therefore it is known that it is not only the meaning of the fruits of the ten wholesome deeds that is called retribution, it also shows the pure retribution in response to beings' capacities.
['ZH_T38_1773_001:0300a29_5']	依如是義故言報應，非直實報名十善果，由是不違大乘道理也。	依如是義故言報應，非直實報名十善果，由是不違大乘道理也。	001	For this reason, it speaks of retribution, and it is not only the actual retribution that is called the fruits of the ten wholesome deeds. For this reason, it does not contradict the principle of the Great Vehicle.
