['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c10_15']	爾時正斷敵對相違。	爾時正斷敵對相違。	026	At that time, the elimination of doubt and the acquisition of doubt are mutually opposed.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c11_6']	未已斷故而非決斷。	未已斷故而非決斷。	026	Because it has not yet been eliminated, it is not a definite elimination.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c11_14']	非決斷故不名智。	非決斷故不名智。	026	Because it is not a definite elimination, it is not called knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c12_6']	可見性攝推度性故。	可見性攝推度性故。	026	Because it is of the nature of inferential understanding, which is of the nature of seeing.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c13_2']	雖先離欲四法忍位自疑已斷。	雖先離欲四法忍位自疑已斷。	026	Although in the state of the four forbearances of the dharma that precede the stage of separation from desire, one's own doubt has already been eliminated,
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c13_11']	是疑得俱忍流類故。	是疑得俱忍流類故。	026	it is because the forbearances are of the same class as the acquisition of doubt.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c13_16']	故亦非智。	故亦非智。	026	Therefore, they are also not knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c14_5']	異生斷惑諸無間道。	異生斷惑諸無間道。	026	In the case of ordinary beings eliminating afflictions, the various uninterrupted paths,
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c14_14']	雖疑得俱非真對治。	雖疑得俱非真對治。	026	although they are simultaneous with the acquisition of doubt, are not true antidotes.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c15_5']	非極相違後容退故。	非極相違後容退故。	026	Because they are not extremely opposed, one may retrogress later.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c15_10']	而得名智。	而得名智。	026	But they are called knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c16_1']	故婆沙四十四云。	故婆沙四十四云。	026	Therefore, the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra, fascicle 44, says:
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c16_4']	復次。	復次。	026	Next,
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c16_17']	忍與所斷疑得俱故非智所攝。	忍與所斷疑得俱故非智所攝。	026	because the forbearances are simultaneous with the acquisition of the eliminated doubt, they are not included in knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c17_7']	設不與俱而是彼類。	設不與俱而是彼類。	026	Even if they are not simultaneous, they are of the same class as that.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c18_1']	有漏無間道非真對治故。	有漏無間道非真對治故。	026	Because the uninterrupted path of the contaminated [realm] is not a true antidote,🔽although it is simultaneous with the acquisition of doubt, it is still knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c19_1']	雖疑得俱而亦是智已上論文　問疑障決斷。	雖疑得俱而亦是智已上論文　問疑障決斷。	026	Question: Doubt obstructs definite understanding.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c19_12']	忍與疑得俱忍即不名智。	忍與疑得俱忍即不名智。	026	The forbearances are simultaneous with the acquisition of doubt, so the forbearances are not called knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c19_18']	無明障推度。	無明障推度。	026	The obstruction of ignorance is conceptualization.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c21_3']	忍與癡得俱忍應不名見　解云疑有相應無明。	忍與癡得俱忍應不名見　解云疑有相應無明。	026	If patience and ignorance are obtained together, patience should not be called seeing. The explanation is that doubt has associated ignorance.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c21_12']	助疑得有力能違忍。	助疑得有力能違忍。	026	Assisting doubt obtains power that can go against patience.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c22_2']	獨頭無明無惑助。	獨頭無明無惑助。	026	Independent ignorance has no delusion to assist.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c22_12']	忍與彼得俱可說名見。	忍與彼得俱可說名見。	026	Patience and its attainment together can be said to be seeing.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c23_4']	若言亦有相應無明。	若言亦有相應無明。	026	If it is said that there is also associated ignorance,

['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c24_11']	未已斷言顯未重知。	未已斷言顯未重知。	026	The phrase not yet abandoned shows that it is not yet known repeatedly.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c24_16']	故婆沙云。	故婆沙云。	026	Therefore the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra says:
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c25_7']	問諸無漏忍何故非智。	問諸無漏忍何故非智。	026	Question: Why are all pure patiences not knowledge?
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c25_17']	答於諸見境未重觀故。	答於諸見境未重觀故。	026	Answer: Because they do not repeatedly contemplate the seen objects.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c26_8']	謂無始來於四聖諦。	謂無始來於四聖諦。	026	That is to say, from beginningless time, regarding the four noble truths,
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c26_17']	未以無漏真實慧見。	未以無漏真實慧見。	026	They have not been seen with pure true wisdom.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c27_8']	今雖創見而未重觀。	今雖創見而未重觀。	026	Now, although they are newly seen, they have not been repeatedly contemplated.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c27_13']	故不名智。	故不名智。	026	Therefore they are not called knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c28_8']	要同類慧於境重觀方成智故。	要同類慧於境重觀方成智故。	026	Only when the wisdom of the same type repeatedly contemplates the objects can it become knowledge.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0383c28_18']	又婆沙一百九十六云。	又婆沙一百九十六云。	026	Moreover, the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra, fascicle 196, says:

['ZH_T41_1821_026:0394c16_1']	以緣欲界四諦境故。	以緣欲界四諦境故。	026	Because it takes the four truths of the desire realm as its object.

['ZH_T41_1821_026:0394c17_15']	謂生上二界必不起法智。	謂生上二界必不起法智。	026	It is said that one who is born in the upper two realms definitely does not give rise to the cognition of dharmas.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0394c18_7']	以彼厭下苦．集諦故。	以彼厭下苦．集諦故。	026	Because they are disgusted with the lower truths of suffering and accumulation,

Question: Can one born in the form realm give rise to the uncontaminated cognition of others' minds and take the mind of the desire realm as its object? Answer: Since it is said that the cognition of dharmas does not take the path of the desire realm as its object,
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0394c24_12']	明知不緣。	明知不緣。	026	it is clear that it does not take it as its object.

['ZH_T41_1821_026:0401c20_2']	退上果得下果。	退上果得下果。	026	regressing from the upper fruit and obtaining the lower fruit,

['ZH_T41_1821_026:0401c23_1']	一從來未曾得。	一從來未曾得。	026	One is never-before-obtained from the beginning.

['ZH_T41_1821_026:0401c24_8']	雖有昔曾得。	雖有昔曾得。	026	although there was a time when it was obtained in the past,
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0401c25_1']	由勝進位得勝曾得故。	由勝進位得勝曾得故。	026	Because in the stage of advancement, one obtains the superior previously obtained,
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0401c25_7']	亦名未曾得。	亦名未曾得。	026	it is also called never before obtained.

['ZH_T41_1821_026:0402a01_10']	故言曾得非所修也。	故言曾得非所修也。	026	Therefore, it says that the previously obtained is not what is cultivated.
['ZH_T41_1821_026:0402a02_6']	若據少分得勝曾得亦是所修。	若據少分得勝曾得亦是所修。	026	If based on the small part of obtaining the superior previously obtained, it is also what is cultivated.
