For what great causes and conditions did he speak the Prajnaparamita Sutra?
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559a12_10']	」故疏引此生起教興大意。	」故疏引此生起教興大意。	001	Therefore, the commentary quotes this to give rise to the general idea of the rise of the teaching.

The Prajna Sutra extensively explains that the intrinsic nature of all dharmas is empty, turning them away from the Lesser Vehicle and leading them to enter the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559a18_12']	故《大品》云「若人欲得阿羅漢果，當學般若波羅蜜」等。	故《大品》云「若人欲得阿羅漢果，當學般若波羅蜜」等。	001	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra says, If a person wishes to attain the fruit of arhatship, they should study prajñā-pāramitā.

This causes the sun of wisdom of true emptiness to hide its brilliance in the dark clouds, and the mysterious pearl of prajñā to be confused by the fish eyes.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559a21_4']	」「三令」下，二、顯理成行。	」「三令」下，二、顯理成行。	001	The three orders and below, second, revealing the principle to form practice.

Correct view means to cause one to believe and understand the true reality, to realize the truth within, and not to grasp at form and emptiness as definitely real. Only then is it called correct view.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559a25_3']	「二諦中道」者，以是此經之所詮故。	「二諦中道」者，以是此經之所詮故。	001	The middle way of the two truths means that this is what is expounded in this sutra.

['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559a27_6']	彼文具彰真俗空有、與奪存壞，以明緣有性空。	彼文具彰真俗空有、與奪存壞，以明緣有性空。	001	The text fully clarifies the emptiness and existence of the two truths, as well as their affirmation and negation, preservation and destruction, in order to illustrate the emptiness of nature that exists due to conditions.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559a28_8']	或相奪全盡、或相與全存、或自壞自存無有障礙。	或相奪全盡、或相與全存、或自壞自存無有障礙。	001	Sometimes they completely negate each other, sometimes they completely affirm each other, and sometimes they mutually destroy and preserve each other without obstruction.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559a29_17']	若相與門，則不壞有之空與彼不壞空之有理不雜故，成非一門。	若相與門，則不壞有之空與彼不壞空之有理不雜故，成非一門。	001	If it is the gate of mutual affirmation, then the emptiness that does not destroy existence and the principle of emptiness that does not destroy existence are not mixed, thus forming the gate of non-oneness.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b02_3']	若相奪門，則此壞有之空與盡空之有全奪，故非一也。	若相奪門，則此壞有之空與盡空之有全奪，故非一也。	001	If it is the gate of mutual negation, then the emptiness that destroys existence here and the complete negation of the emptiness that destroys existence are not one.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b02_19']	若各自存門，則不相是，故非一也。	若各自存門，則不相是，故非一也。	001	If it is the gate of each preserving itself, then they are not the same, thus they are not one.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b03_15']	若各自壞門，則無一可一，故非一也。	若各自壞門，則無一可一，故非一也。	001	If each is destroyed, then there is no one that can be one, therefore it is not one.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b05_4']	以存壞無礙二理不雜，不墮邊故不失中道，是謂二諦中道也。	以存壞無礙二理不雜，不墮邊故不失中道，是謂二諦中道也。	001	Because the two principles of existence and destruction are unobstructed and not mixed, not falling into extremes, and not losing the middle way, this is called the middle way of the two truths.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b05_14']	非異之義，如彼所明。	非異之義，如彼所明。	001	The meaning of non-difference is as explained by them.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b06_12']	又非一與非異復無有二，以緣起無二故。	又非一與非異復無有二，以緣起無二故。	001	Moreover, non-one and non-different are also not two, because dependent arising is non-dual.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b08_16']	以壞有之空即是盡空之有無障礙故，極相違反還極相順，是故相奪相與復無有二，鎔融無礙也。	以壞有之空即是盡空之有無障礙故，極相違反還極相順，是故相奪相與復無有二，鎔融無礙也。	001	Because the emptiness that destroys existence is precisely the emptiness that exhausts existence, there is no obstruction. Therefore, the most extreme contradiction is also the most extreme accord. Therefore, negation and affirmation are also not two, and there is unobstructed fusion.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b09_12']	由非一即非異故，即二諦為中道。	由非一即非異故，即二諦為中道。	001	Because of non-one, there is non-different, therefore the two truths are the middle way.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b10_8']	由非異即非一故，即中道為二諦。	由非異即非一故，即中道為二諦。	001	Because of non-different, there is non-one, therefore the middle way is the two truths.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b12_5']	又非一與非異亦非一，是故即非一之非異與即非異之非一，義不雜故而非一也。	又非一與非異亦非一，是故即非一之非異與即非異之非一，義不雜故而非一也。	001	Moreover, non-one and non-different are also not one, therefore the non-different of non-one and the non-one of non-different are not mixed in meaning, and therefore they are not one.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b14_6']	謂不異中之二、不異二之中融通不雜，故非中非二具足中二，是謂中邊無障無礙之中道。	謂不異中之二、不異二之中融通不雜，故非中非二具足中二，是謂中邊無障無礙之中道。	001	It means that within non-differentiation, the two are not differentiated, and within the non-differentiation of the two, they are harmoniously integrated without being mixed. Therefore, it is neither the middle nor the two, yet it is fully endowed with the middle and the two. This is called the middle way of the middle and the extremes, which is unobstructed and unimpeded.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b14_17']	」令悟此故，斯教興也。	」令悟此故，斯教興也。	001	In order to cause people to realize this, this teaching is established.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b15_13']	「五顯」等者，此下欲成勝行，故演斯經。	「五顯」等者，此下欲成勝行，故演斯經。	001	As for manifesting and so forth, below this, it wishes to accomplish the supreme practices, and therefore expounds this sutra.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b16_15']	以淨信大心萬行之本，又發三心修十信即是行故。	以淨信大心萬行之本，又發三心修十信即是行故。	001	Because pure faith, the great mind, and the myriad practices are the basis, and furthermore, giving rise to the three minds and cultivating the ten faiths is precisely the practice.
['ZH_T33_1713_001:0559b18_8']	「佛德」者，常等四德及佛地河沙真淨功德，義同《華嚴》舉果勸樂生信心也。	「佛德」者，常等四德及佛地河沙真淨功德，義同《華嚴》舉果勸樂生信心也。	001	As for the virtues of the Buddha, the four virtues such as permanence and the true and pure merits and virtues of the Buddha ground as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River, the meaning is the same as the Huayan Sutra, which takes the fruition as an example to encourage the arising of the mind of faith.
