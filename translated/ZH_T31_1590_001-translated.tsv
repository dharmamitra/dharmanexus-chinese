['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074b28_10']	安立大乘三界唯識，以契經說三界唯心，心、意、識、了，名之差別。	安立大乘三界唯識，以契經說三界唯心，心、意、識、了，名之差別。	001	The Mahāyāna is established with the three realms being only consciousness, because a sūtra says the three realms are only mind. Mind, thought, consciousness, and cognition are different names.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c01_14']	此中說心，意兼心所，唯遮外境，不遣相應，內識生時似外境現，如有眩瞖見髮蠅等，此中都無少分實義。	此中說心，意兼心所，唯遮外境，不遣相應，內識生時似外境現，如有眩瞖見髮蠅等，此中都無少分實義。	001	Here, mind is said to include thought and mental factors. It only excludes external objects and does not eliminate the associated [factors]. When internal consciousness arises, it appears as if external objects, like seeing hair, flies, etc. due to an eye disease. There is absolutely no real meaning here.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c02_4']	即於此義，有設難言。	即於此義，有設難言。	001	Regarding this meaning, there are objections.

['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c07_1']	若離識實有色等外法，色等識生不緣色等，何因此識有處得生，非一切處？	若離識實有色等外法，色等識生不緣色等，何因此識有處得生，非一切處？	001	If apart from consciousness there are real external dharmas such as form, and the consciousness of form, etc. arises without relying on form, etc., why is it that this consciousness can arise in some places but not everywhere?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c07_15']	何故此處有時識起，非一切時？	何故此處有時識起，非一切時？	001	Why does consciousness sometimes arise in this place and not at all times?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c08_13']	同一處時有多相續，何不決定隨一識生？	同一處時有多相續，何不決定隨一識生？	001	If there are many continua in the same place and time, why is it not certain that consciousness arises for only one of them?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c09_12']	如眩瞖人見髮蠅等，非無眩瞖有此識生。	如眩瞖人見髮蠅等，非無眩瞖有此識生。	001	It is like a person with blurred vision seeing hairs, flies, and so forth. This consciousness does not arise without blurred vision.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c12_2']	復有何因，諸眩瞖者所見髮等無髮等用，夢中所得飲食、刀杖、毒藥、衣等無飲等用，尋香城等無城等用。	復有何因，諸眩瞖者所見髮等無髮等用，夢中所得飲食、刀杖、毒藥、衣等無飲等用，尋香城等無城等用。	001	What other reason is there that the hairs, etc. seen by those with blurred vision have no function of hairs, etc., the food, drink, swords, staffs, poisons, clothes, etc. obtained in dreams have no function of food, etc., and the fragrant cities, etc. have no function of cities, etc.?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c14_8']	餘髮等物其用非無，若實同無色等外境，唯有內識似外境生，定處、定時、不定相續、有作用物皆不應成。	餘髮等物其用非無，若實同無色等外境，唯有內識似外境生，定處、定時、不定相續、有作用物皆不應成。	001	The function of other hairs, etc. is not nonexistent. If they are really the same as external objects such as form, etc., and there is only internal consciousness appearing like external objects, then definite places, definite times, indefinite continua, and things with functions would all not be established.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c14_13']	非皆不成。	非皆不成。	001	They are not all not established.

['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c18_19']	如夢意說如夢所見，謂如夢中雖無實境，而或有處見有村園男女等物，非一切處。	如夢意說如夢所見，謂如夢中雖無實境，而或有處見有村園男女等物，非一切處。	001	The phrase “like a dream” means like what is seen in a dream. This means that although there is no real external object in a dream, there are places where one sees villages, gardens, men, women, and so on, but not everywhere.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c19_18']	即於是處，或時見有彼村園等，非一切時。	即於是處，或時見有彼村園等，非一切時。	001	In those places, sometimes one sees villages, gardens, and so on, but not all the time.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c20_16']	由此雖無離識實境，而處時定非不得成。	由此雖無離識實境，而處時定非不得成。	001	Therefore, although there is no real external object apart from consciousness, it is not the case that place and time are not determined.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c21_7']	說如鬼言，顯如餓鬼。	說如鬼言，顯如餓鬼。	001	The phrase “like a ghost” shows that it is like a hungry ghost.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c22_6']	河中膿滿故名膿河，如說酥瓶其中酥滿。	河中膿滿故名膿河，如說酥瓶其中酥滿。	001	A river filled with pus is called a river of pus, just as a vessel filled with ghee is called a vessel of ghee.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c23_15']	謂如餓鬼同業異熟，多身共集皆見膿河，非於此中定唯一見。	謂如餓鬼同業異熟，多身共集皆見膿河，非於此中定唯一見。	001	This means that hungry ghosts, due to the ripening of the same karma, gather in many bodies and all see a river of pus, not that only one of them sees it.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c25_4']	等言顯示或見糞等，及見有情執持刀杖遮捍守護不令得食。	等言顯示或見糞等，及見有情執持刀杖遮捍守護不令得食。	001	The word “and so on” shows that they may see excrement and so on, and see sentient beings holding swords and staves to block and guard it so that they cannot eat it.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c26_3']	由此雖無離識實境，而多相續不定義成。	由此雖無離識實境，而多相續不定義成。	001	Therefore, although there is no real external object apart from consciousness, the meaning of the non-determination of many continuums is established.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c27_2']	又如夢中境雖無實，而有損失精血等用。	又如夢中境雖無實，而有損失精血等用。	001	Moreover, although the objects in a dream are unreal, they have the function of losing semen and blood and so on.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c28_1']	由此雖無離識實境，而有虛妄作用義成。	由此雖無離識實境，而有虛妄作用義成。	001	Therefore, although there is no real object apart from consciousness, the meaning of false function is established.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0074c28_19']	如是且依別別譬喻，顯處定等四義得成。	如是且依別別譬喻，顯處定等四義得成。	001	In this way, the four meanings such as definite place are established based on various analogies.

['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a04_1']	應知此中一地獄喻，顯處定等一切皆成。	應知此中一地獄喻，顯處定等一切皆成。	001	It should be known that in this case, one analogy of hell illustrates that all the meanings such as definite place are established.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a04_19']	如地獄言，顯在地獄受逼害苦諸有情類。	如地獄言，顯在地獄受逼害苦諸有情類。	001	The phrase like the hells illustrates the beings in the hells who experience the suffering of being harmed.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a08_5']	謂地獄中雖無真實有情數攝獄卒等事，而彼有情同業異熟增上力故，同處同時眾多相續，皆共見有獄卒、狗、烏、鐵山物等來至其所為逼害事。	謂地獄中雖無真實有情數攝獄卒等事，而彼有情同業異熟增上力故，同處同時眾多相續，皆共見有獄卒、狗、烏、鐵山物等來至其所為逼害事。	001	That is to say, although in the hells there are no real beings belonging to the category of jailers and so forth, due to the power of the dominant effect of the same karma of those beings, in the same place and at the same time, many continuums all together see there are jailers, dogs, crows, iron mountains, and other things coming to their places to cause harm.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a09_4']	由此雖無離識實境，而處定等四義皆成。	由此雖無離識實境，而處定等四義皆成。	001	Because of this, although there are no real objects apart from consciousness, the four meanings such as definite place are all established.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a09_17']	何緣不許獄卒等類是實有情？	何緣不許獄卒等類是實有情？	001	Why do you not admit that the wardens of the hells are real sentient beings?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a10_3']	不應理故。	不應理故。	001	Because it is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a11_2']	且此不應那落迦攝，不受如彼所受苦故。	且此不應那落迦攝，不受如彼所受苦故。	001	They are not included among the hell beings, because they do not experience the suffering experienced by the hell beings.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a11_16']	互相逼害，應不可立彼那落迦。	互相逼害，應不可立彼那落迦。	001	If they are mutually oppressive, they cannot be considered hell beings.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a14_1']	此獄卒等形量力既等，應不極相怖，應自不能忍受鐵地炎熱猛焰恒燒然苦，云何於彼能逼害他？	此獄卒等形量力既等，應不極相怖，應自不能忍受鐵地炎熱猛焰恒燒然苦，云何於彼能逼害他？	001	If the wardens are the same in size, strength, and power, they cannot be mutually fearful. They cannot endure the suffering of the burning iron ground, so how can they oppress others there?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a15_13']	非那落迦不應生彼，如何天上現有傍生，地獄亦然，有傍生鬼為獄卒等。	非那落迦不應生彼，如何天上現有傍生，地獄亦然，有傍生鬼為獄卒等。	001	If they are not hell beings, they should not be born there. How is it that animals exist in heaven, and likewise in hell there are animals and hungry ghosts as wardens?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a15_18']	此救不然。	此救不然。	001	This is not a correct explanation.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a16_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	001	A verse says:
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a17_0']	如天上傍生，　　地獄中不爾，	如天上傍生，　　地獄中不爾，	001	Animals in heaven are not like that in hell.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a18_13']	所執傍生鬼，　　不受彼苦故。	所執傍生鬼，　　不受彼苦故。	001	Because the animals and hungry ghosts you posit do not experience that suffering.

['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a21_17']	諸有傍生生天上者，必有能感彼器樂業，生彼定受器所生樂，非獄卒等受地獄中器所生苦，故不應許傍生鬼趣生那落迦。	諸有傍生生天上者，必有能感彼器樂業，生彼定受器所生樂，非獄卒等受地獄中器所生苦，故不應許傍生鬼趣生那落迦。	001	Animals that are born in the heavens must have karma that can attract the instruments of pleasure there. When born there, they definitely experience the pleasure produced by those instruments. The wardens of hell do not experience the suffering produced by the instruments in hell. Therefore it is not accepted that animals and hungry ghosts are born in the hells.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a25_13']	若爾，應許彼那落迦業增上力生異大種，起勝形顯量力差別，於彼施設獄卒等名，為生彼怖，變現種種動手足等差別作用，如羝羊山乍離乍合、剛鐵林刺或低或昂。	若爾，應許彼那落迦業增上力生異大種，起勝形顯量力差別，於彼施設獄卒等名，為生彼怖，變現種種動手足等差別作用，如羝羊山乍離乍合、剛鐵林刺或低或昂。	001	If that is so, then it must be accepted that by the power of the karma of those in the hells, different primary elements are produced, giving rise to differences in form, appearance, size, and strength. There, the names of wardens, etc. are established, and in order to frighten them, various transformations appear, such as moving the hands and feet, etc. The differences in function are like the mountain of rams sometimes separating and sometimes joining, and the iron forest thorns sometimes lowering and sometimes raising.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075a26_3']	非事全無，然不應理。	非事全無，然不應理。	001	It is not that these things do not exist at all, but it is not reasonable.

['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075b01_1']	何緣不許識由業力如是轉變，而執大種？	何緣不許識由業力如是轉變，而執大種？	001	Why is it not accepted that consciousness transforms in this way by the power of karma, while it is held that the primary elements do so?

['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075b07_10']	執那落迦由自業力生差別大種起形等轉變，彼業熏習理應許在識相續中，不在餘處有熏習識，汝便不許有果轉變，無熏習處翻執有果，此有何因？	執那落迦由自業力生差別大種起形等轉變，彼業熏習理應許在識相續中，不在餘處有熏習識，汝便不許有果轉變，無熏習處翻執有果，此有何因？	001	It is reasonable to allow that the perfuming of karma exists in the continuity of consciousness, not in other places. If there is no perfumed consciousness, you would not allow the transformation of fruit, but you grasp that there is fruit in a place without perfuming. What is the reason for this?
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075b08_17']	有教為因，謂若唯識似色等現無別色等，佛不應說有色等處。	有教為因，謂若唯識似色等現無別色等，佛不應說有色等處。	001	The teaching is the cause, which means that if only consciousness appears as form, etc., without separate form, etc., the Buddha should not say that there are places of form, etc.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075b09_8']	此教非因，有別意故。	此教非因，有別意故。	001	This teaching is not the cause, because it has a separate meaning.

['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075b13_18']	如佛說有化生有情，彼但依心相續不斷能往後世密意趣說，不說實有化生有情。	如佛說有化生有情，彼但依心相續不斷能往後世密意趣說，不說實有化生有情。	001	Just as the Buddha said that there are sentient beings born by transformation, he only spoke with an ulterior intention, relying on the uninterrupted continuity of mind that can go to the next world, and did not say that there really are sentient beings born by transformation.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075b14_16']	說無有情我，但有法因，故說色等處。	說無有情我，但有法因，故說色等處。	001	He said that there is no sentient being or self, but only dharmas and causes, and therefore spoke of the sense bases of form, etc.
['ZH_T31_1590_001:0075b16_1']	契經亦爾，依所化生宜受彼教，密意趣說，非別實有。	契經亦爾，依所化生宜受彼教，密意趣說，非別實有。	001	The sūtras are also like this. Relying on the teachings that those to be converted are inclined to accept, he spoke with an ulterior intention, and not because they really exist separately.

The Buddha, in accordance with those seeds and the form that appears, respectively spoke of them as the eye sense base and the form sense base.

The Buddha, based on those seeds and the tangibles that appear, respectively teaches them as the body sense base and the tangible sense base.
