This is called the three poisons leaving the three realms. It is common to the three gates of liberation. Leaving the mind enters the gate of liberation of emptiness. Leaving form enters the gate of liberation of signlessness. Leaving both enters the gate of liberation of wishlessness. It is common to the meaning of the five dharmas. Leaving the mind is called non-arising. Leaving the characteristics of form is non-birth. Leaving both is precisely non-delusion. Leaving the mind is precisely right knowledge. Miscellaneous colors are precisely thusness. Leaving both is precisely right knowledge and thusness. It is common to the three natures. Leaving the mind and false characteristics is the non-arising of the nature of dependent origination. Leaving form and dependent origination is the non-arising of the nature of dependent origination. Leaving both is precisely the accomplished nature. It is common to the two kinds of no-self. Leaving the mind attains the no-self of persons.

The three kinds of patience: the patience of the inherent non-arising, the patience of the natural non-arising, or the patience of the non-arising of suffering. Separating from mind, one realizes the patience of the inherent non-arising. Separating from form, one attains the patience of the natural non-arising. Separating from both, one realizes the patience of the non-arising of suffering. The meaning of the three virtues is manifested through cultivation and elimination: great prajñā, liberation, and the dharma body. Separating from mind, one manifests the principle.

Detachment from delusion is for transforming sentient beings. Detachment from form is for gathering scattered wholesome dharmas and receiving their retribution. Detachment from both is for attaining all the precepts of the Dharma. There are three kinds of patience: patience in enduring harm from others, patience in peacefully enduring suffering, and patience in investigating the Dharma. Detachment from the mind attains the highest. Detachment from form attains the middle. Detachment from both attains the lowest. There are three kinds of vigor: donning armor, gathering wholesome dharmas, and benefiting and bringing happiness to others. Detachment from the mind is donning armor. Detachment from form is gathering wholesome dharmas. Detachment from both is benefiting and bringing happiness to others. There are three kinds of meditation: meditation of abiding in tranquility, meditation of discerning phenomena, and meditation of evoking spiritual powers. Detachment from the mind is abiding in tranquility. Detachment from form is evoking spiritual powers. Detachment from both is discerning phenomena. There are three kinds of wisdom: non-discriminating wisdom of realizing the emptiness of beings, non-discriminating wisdom of realizing the emptiness of dharmas, and non-discriminating wisdom of realizing the emptiness of both.

The wisdom of emptiness and non-discrimination attained by detaching from form is next. Both are attained by detachment. Always practice based on these three. Moreover, the three knowledges are used to eliminate the three poisons, leave the three realms, and enter the three gates of liberation. By detaching from the three natures, the two kinds of no-self are realized, the three kinds of birth are revealed, the three virtues are perfected, and the three bodies are accomplished. The above is the first expedient correct principle.

The name total manifestation of the Buddha's essence is used. All are called total manifestation because of detaching from mind and form and being common to all. The five faculties are all the gate of wisdom. Seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing are all common to form. The meaning of the faculty of thought is immovable, which is the gate of knowledge. The immovability of mental consciousness is the opening of the gate of wisdom. The summary is finished. If one does not attain the expedient correct immovability,
