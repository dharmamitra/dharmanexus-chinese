['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b15_14']	答互相攝。	答互相攝。	007	Answer: They mutually include each other.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b16_3']	謂前五因是因緣。	謂前五因是因緣。	007	The first five causes are causal conditions.

['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b17_14']	謂前五因是因緣。	謂前五因是因緣。	007	The first five causes are causal conditions.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b18_3']	能作因是增上緣。	能作因是增上緣。	007	The efficient cause is the dominant condition.

['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b19_5']	非因所攝　然無評家。	非因所攝　然無評家。	007	However, there is no definitive conclusion.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b20_7']	今詳二說不同意者　前師兼有作用為能作因。	今詳二說不同意者　前師兼有作用為能作因。	007	Now, examining the two interpretations, the one that is not acceptable is that of the former teacher, who includes the function of action in the efficient cause.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b20_16']	除五因外所有作用。	除五因外所有作用。	007	The function of all dharmas apart from the five causes
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b21_4']	皆能作因攝。	皆能作因攝。	007	is included in the efficient cause.🔽Consequently, the function of making room and of supporting is also included in the efficient cause.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b22_13']	由此開避．任杖之用亦能作因攝　後師取不障礙義為能作因。	由此開避．任杖之用亦能作因攝　後師取不障礙義為能作因。	007	The latter teacher takes the meaning of nonobstruction as the efficient cause.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b23_4']	故即六因攝用不盡。	故即六因攝用不盡。	007	Therefore, the function is not completely included in the six causes.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b23_15']	由斯不障礙是增上緣義。	由斯不障礙是增上緣義。	007	Consequently, nonobstruction is the meaning of the dominant condition,
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b24_7']	非是開避及任杖義。	非是開避及任杖義。	007	and it is not the meaning of making room and supporting.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b25_6']	今詳二說相攝為善　問若爾何故。	今詳二說相攝為善　問若爾何故。	007	Now, I think that the two explanations are best when they are combined.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b25_11']	顯宗論云。	顯宗論云。	007	Question: If this is so, why does the Abhidharma-nyāyânusāra-śāstra say:
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b26_5']	六因．四緣體雖無別而義有異。	六因．四緣體雖無別而義有異。	007	The six causes and four conditions, although not different in substance, have different meanings.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b27_1']	且等無間．及所緣緣既非因攝。	且等無間．及所緣緣既非因攝。	007	Moreover, the immediately preceding condition and the condition as object are not included in the causes.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b27_10']	故知餘二義亦有殊。	故知餘二義亦有殊。	007	Therefore, we know that the other two also have different meanings.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b28_1']	緣義等故與因皆別。	緣義等故與因皆別。	007	Because the meanings of conditions are the same, they are all different from the causes.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b28_11']	故有總辨因．緣異言。	故有總辨因．緣異言。	007	Therefore, there is a general statement that the causes and conditions are different.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b28_16']	因謂能生。	因謂能生。	007	Causes are that which can produce.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b29_2']	緣能長養。	緣能長養。	007	Conditions are that which can nourish.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574b29_12']	猶如生．養二母差別。	猶如生．養二母差別。	007	They are like the difference between the two mothers, the one who gives birth and the one who raises.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c01_1']	又緣攝助因方能生。	又緣攝助因方能生。	007	Moreover, conditions assist causes so that they can produce.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c01_11']	生已相續緣力長養故。	生已相續緣力長養故。	007	After production, they continue in succession, and the power of conditions nourishes them.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c02_1']	或有說因唯有一。	或有說因唯有一。	007	Some say that causes are only one,
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c02_6']	緣乃眾多。	緣乃眾多。	007	while conditions are many.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c02_17']	猶如種子．糞．土等異。	猶如種子．糞．土等異。	007	They are like the differences between seeds, manure, and soil, etc.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c03_1']	又因不共。	又因不共。	007	Moreover, causes are not shared.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c03_6']	共者是緣。	共者是緣。	007	That which is shared is a condition.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c03_9']	如眼。	如眼。	007	For example, the eye.

['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c10_3']	是故因．緣別立名想。	是故因．緣別立名想。	007	Therefore, cause and condition are established as separate names and concepts.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c10_13']	此總意顯因親．緣疎。	此總意顯因親．緣疎。	007	The general meaning shows that the cause is close and the condition is distant.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c11_4']	故因親中親五．疎一。	故因親中親五．疎一。	007	Therefore, among the close causes, five are close and one is distant.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c11_14']	疎緣之中疎三．親一。	疎緣之中疎三．親一。	007	Among the distant conditions, three are distant and one is close.🔽Having briefly explained the various conditions according to principle and teaching, since the treatise explains this, what principle can be used to prove that the inclusion is good?
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c13_12', 'ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c13_17']	已隨理．教略辨諸緣　論既此說何理證知相攝為善　答總說因之與緣非無有異。🔽因是親稱。	已隨理．教略辨諸緣　論既此說何理證知相攝為善　答總說因之與緣非無有異。 因是親稱。	007	The general explanation is that there is a difference between cause and condition.🔽Cause is a close designation.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c14_4']	緣是疎名。	緣是疎名。	007	Condition is a distant name.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c14_17']	六因之中五是親故以親名同。	六因之中五是親故以親名同。	007	Among the six causes, the first five are direct, so they are called direct causes.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c15_11']	四緣之中三是疎故以疎名同。	四緣之中三是疎故以疎名同。	007	Among the four conditions, the first three are indirect, so they are called indirect conditions.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c15_17']	然因中有疎。	然因中有疎。	007	However, among the causes there are indirect ones,
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c16_4']	謂能作因。	謂能作因。	007	namely the condition as direct cause.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c16_12', 'ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c17_7']	緣中有親因緣也。🔽不可以緣義疎故因緣疎能作。	緣中有親因緣也。 不可以緣義疎故因緣疎能作。	007	Among the conditions there are direct causes, namely the condition as cause.🔽One cannot say that because the meaning of condition is indirect, the condition as cause is indirect.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c18_3']	不可以因義親故能作親因緣。	不可以因義親故能作親因緣。	007	One cannot say that because the meaning of cause is direct, the condition as cause is a direct cause.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c18_8']	故顯宗云。	故顯宗云。	007	Therefore the Abhidharma-nyāyânusāra-śāstra says:
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c19_3']	六因．四緣體雖無別而義有異。	六因．四緣體雖無別而義有異。	007	Although the substance of the six causes and four conditions is not different, their meanings are different.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c19_9']	又准婆沙云。	又准婆沙云。	007	Moreover, according to the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāṣra,
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c20_1']	我說作用以為因．果。	我說作用以為因．果。	007	I say that function is the cause and effect.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c20_10']	諸法實體恒無轉變。	諸法實體恒無轉變。	007	The real substance of dharmas is always unchanging,🔽because it is not a cause or effect.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c21_2']	非因．果故　准此故知。	非因．果故　准此故知。	007	According to this, it is known that
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c21_10']	因緣以作用為體。	因緣以作用為體。	007	the condition as cause takes function as its substance.🔽Since function is the same, it is known that there is no difference.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c22_7']	作用既一故知無異　又顯宗云。	作用既一故知無異　又顯宗云。	007	Moreover, the Abhidharma-nyāyânusāra-śāstra says:
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c23_3']	且等無間．及所緣緣既非因攝。	且等無間．及所緣緣既非因攝。	007	Moreover, the condition as immediate antecedent and the condition as object are not included in the causes.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c23_12']	故知餘二義亦有殊。	故知餘二義亦有殊。	007	Therefore it is known that the other two have different meanings.
['ZH_T41_1822_007:0574c24_7']	緣義等故　今詳此說義有餘也。	緣義等故　今詳此說義有餘也。	007	Because the meanings of conditions and so on are the same. Now, examining this explanation, there is more to the meaning.
