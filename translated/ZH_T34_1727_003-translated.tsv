Therefore, under the tree of enlightenment, in thirty-four minds, they realize the four true truths above the dharma of dust and sand. Therefore, they cause the correct afflictions and the two habitual tendencies to be extinguished simultaneously. Therefore, they are able to ultimately reach both truths, and are different from the disciples of the three vehicles. They alone manifest the Buddha's eye and the Buddha's wisdom.
