['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0283c22_17']	或說三相。	或說三相。	Or, it is said to have three characteristics.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0283c23_7']	如此經說三有為相。	如此經說三有為相。	As this sutra says, the three characteristics of the conditioned.

['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a01_17']	故經說一謂即無常　何故生．滅等合名無常　以有非恒有。	故經說一謂即無常　何故生．滅等合名無常　以有非恒有。	Therefore, the sutra says one, which is precisely impermanence. Why are arising, ceasing, etc. collectively called impermanence? Because existence is not always existent,
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a02_5']	無非恒無故。	無非恒無故。	And non-existence is not always non-existent, therefore.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a02_14']	無非恒無所以言生。	無非恒無所以言生。	Non-existence is not always non-existent, so it is said to arise.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a03_5']	有非恒有所以言滅。	有非恒有所以言滅。	It is said that existence is not always existent, so it is called cessation.

['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a05_11']	無不恒無不同兔角。	無不恒無不同兔角。	Nonexistence is not always nonexistent, unlike the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a05_17']	故合名無常。	故合名無常。	Therefore, they are collectively called impermanent.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a06_9']	無彼有．無之常相故。	無彼有．無之常相故。	Because they do not have the constant characteristics of existence and nonexistence.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a06_18']	此非即是四中滅相。	此非即是四中滅相。	This is not the same as the characteristic of cessation among the four.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a07_9']	亦兼生故　住異與生。	亦兼生故　住異與生。	It also includes arising. Abiding and change

['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a08_19']	生及住異俱生所顯。	生及住異俱生所顯。	Arising and abiding change are manifested by arising together.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a09_8']	故住異二合為一分。	故住異二合為一分。	Therefore, abiding and change are combined into one part.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a09_13']	建立生品。	建立生品。	The chapter on arising is established.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a10_4']	於第二分建立滅品。	於第二分建立滅品。	In the second part, the chapter on cessation is established.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a10_13']	此法有時名為生品。	此法有時名為生品。	At a certain time, this dharma is called the chapter on arising.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a11_3']	若後無常名為滅品。	若後無常名為滅品。	If it is later impermanent, it is called the chapter on cessation.

['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a13_4']	又無常相起厭思惟。	又無常相起厭思惟。	The characteristic of impermanence gives rise to the contemplation of disgust.
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a14_1']	即是此中說二所以　說三相者。	即是此中說二所以　說三相者。	This is the reason for speaking of two in this context. As for speaking of three characteristics,
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a14_5']	謂一生。	謂一生。	They are: 1. birth,
['ZH_T43_1830_02b:0284a14_8']	二滅。	二滅。	2. cessation,
