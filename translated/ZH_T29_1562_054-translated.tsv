If it arises from love, it is associated with a non-defiled mind. This is called a similarity in practice but a difference in substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_054:0642c22_7']	如是於行見不續生，從邪方便生，此屬斷見；	如是於行見不續生，從邪方便生，此屬斷見；	054	In the same way, the view that the aggregates do not continue to be reborn after death arises from wrong means. This belongs to the view of annihilation.

['ZH_T29_1562_054:0642c27_11']	或由定力於他有情許有煩惱，彼命終後不見中生二有續故，宿住隨念智有礙故，由如是等有斷見生。	或由定力於他有情許有煩惱，彼命終後不見中生二有續故，宿住隨念智有礙故，由如是等有斷見生。	054	Or, due to the power of samādhi, they allow that other sentient beings have afflictions, but they do not see that after the sentient being dies, there is an intermediate existence and two existences that continue. Because the knowledge of recollecting past lives is obstructed, views of annihilation arise due to these and other such causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_054:0643a01_3']	若常見生或由尋伺，見行相似相續轉故，能憶先時所更事故，受持外道常見論故，或由定力隨念宿住所更事故。	若常見生或由尋伺，見行相似相續轉故，能憶先時所更事故，受持外道常見論故，或由定力隨念宿住所更事故。	054	If eternalist views arise, they may do so because of investigation and analysis, because they see that the continuity of activity is similar, because they remember past events, because they uphold the eternalist doctrines of non-Buddhists, or because of recollecting past lives due to the power of samādhi.

['ZH_T29_1562_054:0643a10_17']	非不有見隨眠隨增，二取見隨眠於彼隨增故。	非不有見隨眠隨增，二取見隨眠於彼隨增故。	054	It is not that the proclivity of view does not increase, because the proclivities of the two graspings increase there.
['ZH_T29_1562_054:0643a11_16']	何緣三見別立見結，二取別立為取結耶？	何緣三見別立見結，二取別立為取結耶？	054	Why are the three views separately established as the fetter of view, and the two graspings separately established as the fetter of grasping?
['ZH_T29_1562_054:0643a13_6']	三見、二取物取等故，謂彼三見有十八物，二取亦然，故名物等。	三見、二取物取等故，謂彼三見有十八物，二取亦然，故名物等。	054	Because the three views and the two graspings are the same in substance and grasping. That is to say, those three views have eighteen substances, and the two graspings are also like this, thus they are called the same in substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_054:0643a13_15']	說此物等於義何益？	說此物等於義何益？	054	What benefit is there in saying that these substances are the same?

It is said that with regard to the various prosperous things of others, one seeks out means to destroy them first and foremost, causing the mind to be scorched and agitated.

Therefore, these three subsume those three faculties.

Therefore, he rebuked him, revealing that the view of self, etc.
