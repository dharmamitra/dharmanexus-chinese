['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c06_1']	一圓滿義，具轂、輞、輻，或擇法覺等，體用周備名之為輪。	一圓滿義，具轂、輞、輻，或擇法覺等，體用周備名之為輪。	04b	First, the meaning of being complete. It is called a wheel because the essence and function of the dharmas such as the understanding of dharmas are completely contained, like a wheel with a hub, rim, and spokes.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c07_10']	二摧壞義，此四種法，若伏、若斷、若助、若正，未斷煩惱皆能摧故。	二摧壞義，此四種法，若伏、若斷、若助、若正，未斷煩惱皆能摧故。	04b	Second, the meaning of crushing. It is called a wheel because these four kinds of dharmas can all crush the afflictions that have not yet been eliminated, whether by subduing them, cutting them off, assisting, or directly confronting them.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c08_4']	三鎮遏義，已伏煩惱令勢遠故。	三鎮遏義，已伏煩惱令勢遠故。	04b	Third, the meaning of suppressing and obstructing. It is called a wheel because it suppresses the afflictions that have already been subdued and keeps them from gaining strength.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c11_17']	四不定義，從自見至自脩，從自脩至自無學，從自無學智發言教，他從言教解於諦理，他從諦理起於正行，他從正行起於果智，如是展轉復為他說；	四不定義，從自見至自脩，從自脩至自無學，從自無學智發言教，他從言教解於諦理，他從諦理起於正行，他從正行起於果智，如是展轉復為他說；	04b	Fourth, the meaning of being indefinite. It is called a wheel because it goes from one's own view to one's own cultivation, from one's own cultivation to one's own state of no more learning, from one's own state of no more learning to the arising of wisdom and verbal teachings, from others' understanding of the truth through verbal teachings, from others' correct practice based on the truth, to others' arising of the wisdom of fruition. In this way, it continues to be explained to others.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c13_13']	如轉輪王所有輪寶，能降未伏諸煩惱故，能鎮已伏諸煩惱故，往復往故。	如轉輪王所有輪寶，能降未伏諸煩惱故，能鎮已伏諸煩惱故，往復往故。	04b	It is like the precious wheel possessed by a universal monarch, which can subdue those who have not yet been subdued and can control those who have already been subdued, going back and forth.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c16_14']	《瑜伽論》說「當知世尊轉所解法置於阿若憍陳如身中，此復隨轉置餘身中，彼復隨轉置餘身中，以是展轉隨轉義故說名為輪。	《瑜伽論》說「當知世尊轉所解法置於阿若憍陳如身中，此復隨轉置餘身中，彼復隨轉置餘身中，以是展轉隨轉義故說名為輪。	04b	The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says: You should know that the Bhagavān turns the Dharma he has realized and places it in the body of Ājñātakauṇḍinya. This then continues to turn and is placed in the bodies of others. This then continues to turn and is placed in the bodies of still others. Because of this successive continuation, it is called a wheel.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c17_6']	」法即是輪，持業釋也。	」法即是輪，持業釋也。	04b	 The Dharma is itself the wheel, a compound word in which the word wheel is the qualifier and Dharma is the qualified.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c17_20']	「轉」者動也顯也、運也起也。	「轉」者動也顯也、運也起也。	04b	Turning means moving, manifesting, conveying, and arising.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c20_11']	動宣言教顯揚妙理，運聖道於聲前，起真智於言後，圓摧障惱名轉法輪，所轉即法輪，法輪之轉，二釋皆得。	動宣言教顯揚妙理，運聖道於聲前，起真智於言後，圓摧障惱名轉法輪，所轉即法輪，法輪之轉，二釋皆得。	04b	Moving and proclaiming the teachings, manifesting the wondrous principle, conveying the holy path in front of the sound, and giving rise to true wisdom after the words, completely destroying obstacles and afflictions is called turning the Dharma wheel. The turning is itself the Dharma wheel, both explanations are acceptable.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c21_17']	轉相者，九十五說由五種相轉法輪者，當知名為善轉法輪：	轉相者，九十五說由五種相轉法輪者，當知名為善轉法輪：	04b	As for the characteristics of turning, the Jiuku wu says that turning the Dharma wheel through five characteristics is called turning the Dharma wheel well:
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c22_17']	一者世尊為菩薩時，為得所得所緣境界；	一者世尊為菩薩時，為得所得所緣境界；	04b	First, the World-Honored One, when he was a bodhisattva, attained the objects of his attainment;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c23_8']	二者為得所得方便；	二者為得所得方便；	04b	Second, he attained the skillful means of his attainment;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c23_17']	三者證得自所應得；	三者證得自所應得；	04b	Third, he realized what he should attain for himself;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c24_17']	四者得已樹他相續，令於自證深生信解；	四者得已樹他相續，令於自證深生信解；	04b	Fourth, having attained it, he established others in the continuity [of practice], causing them to deeply believe and understand his own realization;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c25_11']	五者令於他所證深生信解。	五者令於他所證深生信解。	04b	Fifth, he caused them to deeply believe and understand what others have realized.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0731c28_16']	此意總說化身化相，自證果時令聲聞等亦有所證，不依菩薩報身成義，或亦依實菩薩轉義，總依始終究竟作論，不依一會得成三轉。	此意總說化身化相，自證果時令聲聞等亦有所證，不依菩薩報身成義，或亦依實菩薩轉義，總依始終究竟作論，不依一會得成三轉。	04b	This generally refers to the transformation body and its transformations. When he realized his own fruit, he also caused the śrāvakas, etc. to have something to realize. It does not rely on the meaning of the bodhisattva's reward body being accomplished, or it also relies on the meaning of the actual bodhisattva's transformation. It generally relies on the ultimate conclusion of the beginning and end to make a treatise, not on a single assembly being able to accomplish the three turnings.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a01_9']	所緣境者謂四聖諦依安立諦、非安立諦依於三性，皆此攝故。	所緣境者謂四聖諦依安立諦、非安立諦依於三性，皆此攝故。	04b	The objects are the four noble truths. They rely on the truth of establishment and the truth of non-establishment. They rely on the three natures, because they are all included in this.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a03_12']	得方便者，謂即於此四聖諦中三周正轉十二相智，此自三周轉法輪相，為得無上菩提因故。	得方便者，謂即於此四聖諦中三周正轉十二相智，此自三周轉法輪相，為得無上菩提因故。	04b	The skillful means of attainment refers to the wisdom of the twelve aspects that correctly turns three times in these four noble truths. This is the characteristic of turning the wheel of the Dharma three times for oneself, because it is the cause for attaining supreme enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a06_16']	最初轉者，謂昔菩薩入現觀時，如實了知，是苦聖諦，廣說乃至，是道聖諦，於中所有現量聖智能斷見道所斷煩惱，爾時說名真聖慧眼。	最初轉者，謂昔菩薩入現觀時，如實了知，是苦聖諦，廣說乃至，是道聖諦，於中所有現量聖智能斷見道所斷煩惱，爾時說名真聖慧眼。	04b	The first turning is that when the Bodhisattva entered into realization, he truly knew that this is the holy truth of suffering, and so on up to this is the holy truth of the path. The holy wisdom of direct perception that can eliminate the passions eliminated by the path of insight is called the true holy wisdom-eye.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a08_3']	即此由依去來今世有差別故，如其次第名智明覺。	即此由依去來今世有差別故，如其次第名智明覺。	04b	This is called knowledge, illumination, and enlightenment because it exists in the past, future, and present.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a11_12']	此說一智總名法眼，有三行相名智明覺，非於一諦別起四智，由真見道唯一剎那，不同小乘上下別觀，依詮證滅說通三世，非是滅諦通三世有。	此說一智總名法眼，有三行相名智明覺，非於一諦別起四智，由真見道唯一剎那，不同小乘上下別觀，依詮證滅說通三世，非是滅諦通三世有。	04b	This is said to be one knowledge, generally called the Dharma-eye, which has three aspects called knowledge, illumination, and enlightenment. It is not that four knowledges are separately produced with regard to one truth. Because the path of insight of reality is only one moment, it is not like the Hinayana, which observes the upper and lower truths separately. It is said that it is common to the three periods of time in order to realize cessation in dependence on the teaching, but cessation is not common to the three periods of time.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a15_17']	第二轉者，謂是有學，以其妙慧如實通達，我當於後猶有所作，應當遍知未知苦諦，應當永斷未斷集諦，應當作證未證滅諦，應當脩習未脩道諦，如是亦有四種行相，如前應知。	第二轉者，謂是有學，以其妙慧如實通達，我當於後猶有所作，應當遍知未知苦諦，應當永斷未斷集諦，應當作證未證滅諦，應當脩習未脩道諦，如是亦有四種行相，如前應知。	04b	The second turning is that of the learner, who, with his wondrous understanding, realizes that he still has something to do, that he must thoroughly understand the truth of suffering that he has not yet understood, that he must completely eliminate the truth of the accumulation that he has not yet eliminated, that he must realize the truth of cessation that he has not yet realized, and that he must cultivate the truth of the path that he has not yet cultivated. There are also four aspects, which should be known as before.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a19_2']	第三轉者，謂是無學，已得盡智無生智故，言所應作我皆已作，謂我已遍知未知苦諦，乃至廣說，我已脩習未脩道諦，亦有四行類前應知。	第三轉者，謂是無學，已得盡智無生智故，言所應作我皆已作，謂我已遍知未知苦諦，乃至廣說，我已脩習未脩道諦，亦有四行類前應知。	04b	The third turning is that of the post-learner, because he has attained the knowledge of extinction and the knowledge of non-arising. He says, What should be done, I have already done, meaning that he has already thoroughly understood the truth of suffering that he did not yet understand, and so on, and that he has already cultivated the truth of the path that he did not yet cultivate. There are also four aspects, which should be known as before.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a21_1']	此差別者，謂前二轉四種行相是其有學真聖慧眼，最後一種是其無學真聖慧眼。	此差別者，謂前二轉四種行相是其有學真聖慧眼，最後一種是其無學真聖慧眼。	04b	The difference is that the four aspects of the first two turnings are the true wisdom eye of the learner, while the last kind is the true wisdom eye of the post-learner.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a23_13']	觀此文意，初轉之時，見道以前加行智位，雖知四諦但是轉因猶非正轉，未摧壞故，由此但名損力益能，轉位所攝。	觀此文意，初轉之時，見道以前加行智位，雖知四諦但是轉因猶非正轉，未摧壞故，由此但名損力益能，轉位所攝。	04b	According to the meaning of this text, at the time of the first turning, even though the state of added effort prior to the path of insight knows the four truths, it is only a cause of the turning and is not yet the actual turning, because it has not yet destroyed the passions. Consequently, it is only called the stage of weakening the power of the passions and increasing the power of the antidote, and it is included in the stage of the turning.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a24_13']	入見道中真無間道正名為轉，正斷惑故。	入見道中真無間道正名為轉，正斷惑故。	04b	When one enters the path of insight, the true uninterrupted path is called the actual turning, because one is actually eliminating the passions.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732a26_13']	其解脫道及相見道亦名初轉，雖不斷惑，斷麁重故、鎮已伏故、亦非別知四諦相故。	其解脫道及相見道亦名初轉，雖不斷惑，斷麁重故、鎮已伏故、亦非別知四諦相故。	04b	The path of liberation and the path of insight into the knowledge of the knowledge of the four truths are also called the first turning, because even though one does not eliminate the passions, one does eliminate the gross propensities, because one subdues the passions that have already been subdued, and because one does not know the characteristics of the four truths separately.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b01_5']	此後脩道未斷惑前，所起行相應遍知等，是正轉相，正起真智乃至金剛心，斷諸煩惱亦此轉攝，起別行相但擬趣聖，斷惑道故，折伏正斷俱名轉故。	此後脩道未斷惑前，所起行相應遍知等，是正轉相，正起真智乃至金剛心，斷諸煩惱亦此轉攝，起別行相但擬趣聖，斷惑道故，折伏正斷俱名轉故。	04b	The subsequent path of cultivation, prior to the elimination of the passions, generates aspects of knowledge that are to be fully understood, etc., and this is the actual turning, because one generates true knowledge, up to the diamondlike concentration, and eliminates the various passions. This turning also includes the generation of other aspects of knowledge, because it is the path that is directed toward the holy and that eliminates the passions, because both the subduing and the actual elimination of the passions are called the turning.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b03_2']	至其無學解脫道後，起我已作所應作智，後更不斷，但鎮已伏無降未伏。	至其無學解脫道後，起我已作所應作智，後更不斷，但鎮已伏無降未伏。	04b	After the path of liberation of the stage of post-learner, one generates the cognition that one has done what should be done. After that, one does not cut off again, but only subdues what has already been subdued and does not subdue what has not yet been subdued.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b04_11']	然見道前雖有伏道不與轉名，非無漏故，前無無漏故不同脩。	然見道前雖有伏道不與轉名，非無漏故，前無無漏故不同脩。	04b	However, although there is a path of subduing before the path of insight, it is not given the name of turning, because it is not pure. Because there was no pure [path] before, it is not the same as cultivation.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b09_12']	如是菩薩自為三轉，初轉在見道名印相轉，次轉在脩道名應脩轉，後轉在無學道名已作轉，一一轉時於一一諦生四行相，三轉竪論成十二相，如是四諦合四十八，不過十二以數等故，總名三轉十二行相。	如是菩薩自為三轉，初轉在見道名印相轉，次轉在脩道名應脩轉，後轉在無學道名已作轉，一一轉時於一一諦生四行相，三轉竪論成十二相，如是四諦合四十八，不過十二以數等故，總名三轉十二行相。	04b	Thus, the bodhisattva has three turnings for himself. The first turning is in the path of insight and is called the turning of the seal of characteristics. The next turning is in the path of cultivation and is called the turning of what should be cultivated. The last turning is in the path of post-learner and is called the turning of what has been done. At each turning, four aspects are generated for each truth. Discussing the three turnings vertically, they form twelve aspects. Thus, for the four truths combined, there are forty-eight. They do not exceed twelve because the number is equal. Therefore, they are collectively called the three turnings and twelve aspects.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b11_6']	《俱舍》亦說眼、智、明、覺，別觀諦故，彼以法忍、法智、類忍、類智，如次為四。	《俱舍》亦說眼、智、明、覺，別觀諦故，彼以法忍、法智、類忍、類智，如次為四。	04b	The Abhidharma-kośa also speaks of eye, cognition, illumination, and enlightenment, because one contemplates the truths separately. The four are respectively the cognition of dharmas, subsequent cognition, cognition of suffering, and cognition of origination.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b12_8']	若作此釋，所作八諦觀於一一諦便無四行相。	若作此釋，所作八諦觀於一一諦便無四行相。	04b	If this interpretation is made, then the eight kinds of contemplations of the four noble truths would not have four aspects for each truth.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b14_13']	或忍、智一一皆具四行相，照境分明者名眼，對治無知名智，對治無明名明，對治邪覺名覺。	或忍、智一一皆具四行相，照境分明者名眼，對治無知名智，對治無明名明，對治邪覺名覺。	04b	Or, each of the forbearances and knowledges has all four aspects. That which illuminates objects clearly is called eye, that which counteracts ignorance is called knowledge, that which counteracts ignorance is called illumination, and that which counteracts wrong awakening is called awakening.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b17_6']	不同於此證得自所應得者，謂得無上正等菩提，謂即雙取菩提、涅槃，前為後因，前無間道為解脫道因。	不同於此證得自所應得者，謂得無上正等菩提，謂即雙取菩提、涅槃，前為後因，前無間道為解脫道因。	04b	Not the same as this, attaining what one should attain for oneself means attaining unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, which refers to simultaneously taking enlightenment and nirvāṇa, with the former being the cause of the latter, and the uninterrupted path being the cause of the path of liberation.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b19_16']	此說菩薩自三周轉法輪之果，或說法身涅槃真理名無上菩提，起無學位菩提報身已作之智，證法身故。	此說菩薩自三周轉法輪之果，或說法身涅槃真理名無上菩提，起無學位菩提報身已作之智，證法身故。	04b	This explains the fruit of the Bodhisattva's three turnings of the Dharma wheel, or it explains the unsurpassed enlightenment of the Dharma body nirvāṇa truth, because the knowledge of the fruition of the Bodhi retribution body that arises in the stage of no-more-learning has already realized the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b23_3']	《俱舍論》等無佛自轉樹他相續令於自證生信解者，謂如長老阿若憍陳如，從世尊所聞正法已，最初悟解四聖諦法，又答問言我已解法。	《俱舍論》等無佛自轉樹他相續令於自證生信解者，謂如長老阿若憍陳如，從世尊所聞正法已，最初悟解四聖諦法，又答問言我已解法。	04b	The Abhidharma-kośa and other texts do not mention that the Buddha himself turned the wheel of the Dharma in the mental continuum of others, causing them to generate faith and understanding in their own realization. This refers to elders such as Kauṇḍinya, who first comprehended the four noble truths after hearing the true Dharma from the World-Honored One, and also answered the question by saying, I have already understood the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b24_11']	從此已後如前所說究竟行相，五皆證得阿羅漢果生解脫處。	從此已後如前所說究竟行相，五皆證得阿羅漢果生解脫處。	04b	From then on, as previously explained, all five of them attained the fruit of arhatship and gave rise to the state of liberation.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b27_3']	此說世尊自得道故，復為於他三轉法輪，同《俱舍》說三周循歷四聖諦故，謂此是苦，乃至此是道，是名初轉；	此說世尊自得道故，復為於他三轉法輪，同《俱舍》說三周循歷四聖諦故，謂此是苦，乃至此是道，是名初轉；	04b	This is said because the World-Honored One himself attained the Way and then turned the wheel of the Dharma for others. It is the same as the Abhidharma-kośa's explanation of the three revolutions that thoroughly investigate the four noble truths, namely, This is suffering, up to This is the path, which is the first revolution;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b28_2']	謂此應遍知，乃至此應脩習，是第二轉；	謂此應遍知，乃至此應脩習，是第二轉；	04b	This should be thoroughly known, up to This should be cultivated, is the second revolution;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732b28_18']	此已遍知乃至此已脩習，是第三轉。	此已遍知乃至此已脩習，是第三轉。	04b	This has been thoroughly known up to This has been cultivated is the third revolution.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732c01_4']	如次顯示見道、脩道、無學道三，此是佛為他三轉者：	如次顯示見道、脩道、無學道三，此是佛為他三轉者：	04b	These respectively reveal the three: the path of seeing, the path of cultivation, and the path of no-more-learning. This is the Buddha's turning the wheel of the Dharma for others:
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732c01_15']	初名示相，示四諦相故；	初名示相，示四諦相故；	04b	The first is called indicating the characteristics, because it indicates the characteristics of the four truths;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732c02_7']	次名勸脩，勸脩諦行故；	次名勸脩，勸脩諦行故；	04b	The next is called encouraging practice, because it encourages the practice of the truths;
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732c03_3']	後名作證，為作證明知彼滿故。	後名作證，為作證明知彼滿故。	04b	The last is called attaining realization, because it serves as a witness to their completion.
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732c04_3']	由彼憍陳最初悟解入見道已，佛問彼言：	由彼憍陳最初悟解入見道已，佛問彼言：	04b	Because Kauṇḍinya first understood and entered the path of seeing, the Buddha asked him,
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732c04_8']	汝已解耶？	汝已解耶？	04b	Have you understood?
['ZH_T34_1723_04b:0732c04_11']	彼答：	彼答：	04b	He replied,
