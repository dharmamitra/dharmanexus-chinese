['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b13_18']	如是四緣，依十五處義差別故，立為十因。	如是四緣，依十五處義差別故，立為十因。	These four conditions are established as ten causes based on the distinctions in meaning of fifteen bases.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b14_8']	云何此依十五處立？	云何此依十五處立？	How are they established based on fifteen bases?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b16_17']	一語依處，謂法名想所起語性，即依此處立隨說因，謂依此語隨見聞等說諸義故，此即能說為所說因。	一語依處，謂法名想所起語性，即依此處立隨說因，謂依此語隨見聞等說諸義故，此即能說為所說因。	The first is the base of speech, which refers to the nature of speech that arises from dharmas, names, and concepts. Based on this base, the reason of following speech is established. It means that based on this speech, one speaks about various meanings according to what one sees, hears, etc. This is the reason of what is spoken for what is able to be spoken.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b18_18']	有論說此是名想見，由如名字取相執著隨起說故，若依彼說，便顯此因是語依處。	有論說此是名想見，由如名字取相執著隨起說故，若依彼說，便顯此因是語依處。	Some treatises say this is names, concepts, and views. Because one speaks according to what one grasps in terms of characteristics and clings to according to names, if one relies on those explanations, it is then shown that this reason is the base of speech.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b21_12']	二領受依處，謂所觀待能所受性，即依此處立觀待因，謂觀待此令彼諸事或生或住或成或得，此是彼觀待因。	二領受依處，謂所觀待能所受性，即依此處立觀待因，謂觀待此令彼諸事或生或住或成或得，此是彼觀待因。	The second is the base of experience, which refers to the nature of what is observed and the ability to experience. Based on this base, the reason of observation is established. It means that observing this causes those matters to either arise, abide, be accomplished, or be attained. This is the reason of observation for that.

On the basis of this support, the projecting cause is established, because it is able to project its own distant result.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b25_5']	四有潤種子依處，謂內外種已成熟位，即依此處立生起因，謂能生起近自果故。	四有潤種子依處，謂內外種已成熟位，即依此處立生起因，謂能生起近自果故。	The fifth is the support of moistened seeds, that is, internal and external seeds in a mature state. On the basis of this support, the productive cause is established, because it is able to produce its own proximate result.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b26_2', 'ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b26_16']	五無間滅依處，謂心心所等無間緣。🔽六境界依處，謂心心所所緣緣。	五無間滅依處，謂心心所等無間緣。 六境界依處，謂心心所所緣緣。	The sixth is the support of cessation without a remainder, that is, the similar and immediately antecedent condition of mind and mental activities.🔽The seventh is the support of objects, that is, the condition as object of mind and mental activities.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b27_10', 'ZH_T31_1585_008:0041b28_16']	七根依處，謂心心所所依六根。🔽八作用依處，謂於所作業作具作用，即除種子，餘助現緣。	七根依處，謂心心所所依六根。 八作用依處，謂於所作業作具作用，即除種子，餘助現緣。	The eighth is the support of organs, that is, the six organs that are the support of mind and mental activities.🔽The ninth is the support of activity, that is, the activity of the instrument in the performance of an action, that is, the remaining aids to the actualization of seeds.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c01_4']	九士用依處，謂於所作業作者作用，即除種子，餘作現緣。	九士用依處，謂於所作業作者作用，即除種子，餘作現緣。	The tenth is the support of the doer, that is, the activity of the doer in the performance of an action, that is, the remaining aids to the actualization of seeds.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c02_9']	十真實見依處，謂無漏見，除引自種於無漏法能助引證。	十真實見依處，謂無漏見，除引自種於無漏法能助引證。	The eleventh is the support of true views, that is, pure views, that is, the ability to assist in attracting and realizing pure dharmas, excluding the attraction of ones own seeds.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c04_2']	總依此六立攝受因，謂攝受五辦有漏法，具攝受六辦無漏故。	總依此六立攝受因，謂攝受五辦有漏法，具攝受六辦無漏故。	In general, the six are established as the cause of assistance, because the first five assist in the production of impure dharmas, and the sixth assists in the production of pure dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c06_1']	十一隨順依處，謂無記染善現種諸行能隨順同類勝品諸法，即依此處立引發因。	十一隨順依處，謂無記染善現種諸行能隨順同類勝品諸法，即依此處立引發因。	The eleventh is the basis of conformity, that is, the various activities of the indeterminate, the impure, and the good, which are seeds, that conform to and assist dharmas of their own species that are superior. The cause of attraction is established on the basis of this basis.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c07_1']	謂能引起同類勝行及能引得無為法故。	謂能引起同類勝行及能引得無為法故。	That is, it is able to attract and generate activities of its own species that are superior, and it is able to attract and obtain unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c09_16']	十二差別功能依處，謂有為法各於自果有能起證差別勢力，即依此處立定異因，謂各能生自界等果及各能得自乘果故。	十二差別功能依處，謂有為法各於自果有能起證差別勢力，即依此處立定異因，謂各能生自界等果及各能得自乘果故。	The twelfth is the basis of specific power, that is, conditioned dharmas each have a power to generate and realize their own results. The cause of specific determination is established on the basis of this basis, because each is able to generate its own realm, etc., as results, and each is able to obtain its own vehicle as a result.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c13_5']	十三和合依處，謂從領受乃至差別功能依處，於所生住成得果中有和合力，即依此處立同事因，謂從觀待乃至定異皆同生等一事業故。	十三和合依處，謂從領受乃至差別功能依處，於所生住成得果中有和合力，即依此處立同事因，謂從觀待乃至定異皆同生等一事業故。	The thirteenth is the basis of combination, that is, from the basis of grasping up to the basis of specific power, there is a power of combination in the generation, duration, completion, and acquisition of results. The cause of the same activity is established on the basis of this basis, because from the basis of contemplation up to the basis of specific determination, all are the same in having one activity, such as the generation, etc., of results.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c15_6']	十四障礙依處，謂於生住成得事中能障礙法，即依此處立相違因，謂彼能違生等事故。	十四障礙依處，謂於生住成得事中能障礙法，即依此處立相違因，謂彼能違生等事故。	The fourteenth is the foundation of obstruction, which refers to dharmas that obstruct the events of birth, abiding, and so forth. Obstructive causes are established on the basis of this foundation, because they are able to obstruct the events of birth and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c17_11', 'ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c18_2']	十五不障礙依處，謂於生住成得事中不障礙法，即依此處立不相違因，謂彼不違生等事故。🔽如是十因二因所攝：	十五不障礙依處，謂於生住成得事中不障礙法，即依此處立不相違因，謂彼不違生等事故。 如是十因二因所攝：	The fifteenth is the foundation of nonobstruction, which refers to dharmas that do not obstruct the events of birth, abiding, and so forth. Nonobstructive causes are established on the basis of this foundation, because they do not obstruct the events of birth and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c18_10']	一能生、二方便。	一能生、二方便。	These ten causes are subsumed in two causes: the first is the productive cause, and the second is the circumstantial cause.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c19_16']	〈菩薩地〉說牽引種子生起種子名能生因，所餘諸因方便因攝。	〈菩薩地〉說牽引種子生起種子名能生因，所餘諸因方便因攝。	The Bodhisattvabhūmi Sāstra says that the projecting seed and the productive seed are called the productive cause, and the remaining causes are circumstantial causes.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c22_1']	此說牽引生起引發定異同事不相違中諸因緣種，未成熟位名牽引種，已成熟位名生起種。	此說牽引生起引發定異同事不相違中諸因緣種，未成熟位名牽引種，已成熟位名生起種。	This means that among the projecting, productive, attracting, differentiating, cooperating, and nonopposing seeds of the causes and conditions, those that are not yet mature are called projecting seeds, and those that are mature are called productive seeds.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c23_1']	彼六因中諸因緣種，皆攝在此二位中故。	彼六因中諸因緣種，皆攝在此二位中故。	Because all the seeds of causes and conditions among the six causes are included in these two states.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c24_11']	離有現起是能生因，如四因中生自種者而多間斷，此略不說。	離有現起是能生因，如四因中生自種者而多間斷，此略不說。	The cause that is able to generate is the cause that is separated from the present state of activity, as the four causes that generate their own seeds, but it is often interrupted and therefore is not mentioned here.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c25_12']	或親辦果亦立種名，如說現行穀麥等種。	或親辦果亦立種名，如說現行穀麥等種。	Or, a cause that directly produces results is also called a seed, as in the case of the seeds of present actual dharmas such as grain and wheat.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c27_11']	所餘因謂初二五九，及六因中非因緣法，皆是生熟因緣種餘，故總說為方便因攝。	所餘因謂初二五九，及六因中非因緣法，皆是生熟因緣種餘，故總說為方便因攝。	The remaining causes are the first two, the fifth, and the ninth, and the non-pervading dharmas among the six causes, which are the remaining causes of the cause that is the condition as cause of the cause that generates and the cause that matures. Therefore they are generally said to be included in the facilitating cause.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c28_13']	非此二種唯屬彼二因，餘四因中有因緣種故。	非此二種唯屬彼二因，餘四因中有因緣種故。	These two kinds of causes are not only the two causes mentioned above, because the cause that is the condition as cause is included in the remaining four causes.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0041c29_15']	非唯彼八名所餘因，彼二因亦有非因緣種故。	非唯彼八名所餘因，彼二因亦有非因緣種故。	The remaining causes are not only the eight causes mentioned above, because the two causes mentioned above also include the non-pervading dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a01_15']	有尋等地說生起因是能生因，餘方便攝。	有尋等地說生起因是能生因，餘方便攝。	The stages with applied thought, etc., say that the generating cause is the cause that generates, and the others are included in the facilitating cause.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a03_6']	此文意說六因中現種是因緣者皆名生起因，能親生起自類果故。	此文意說六因中現種是因緣者皆名生起因，能親生起自類果故。	The meaning of this passage is that among the six causes, the present and seeds that are the condition as cause are all called generating causes, because they are able to directly generate results of the same species.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a04_15']	此所餘因皆方便攝，非此生起唯屬彼因，餘五因中有因緣故。	此所餘因皆方便攝，非此生起唯屬彼因，餘五因中有因緣故。	The remaining causes are all included in the facilitating causes, because the generation of this consciousness is not due to that cause alone, because the other five causes include the cause of similar species.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a05_17']	非唯彼九名所餘因，彼生起因中有非因緣故。	非唯彼九名所餘因，彼生起因中有非因緣故。	It is not only the remaining causes that are not called projecting causes, because the projecting cause includes the cause of similar species that is not a cause of direct result.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a07_7']	或〈菩薩地〉所說牽引生起種子即彼二因，所餘諸因即彼餘八。	或〈菩薩地〉所說牽引生起種子即彼二因，所餘諸因即彼餘八。	Or, the projecting and productive seeds mentioned in the Bodhisattvabhūmi are the two causes, and the remaining causes are the other eight.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a08_9']	雖二因內有非能生因，而因緣種勝顯故偏說。	雖二因內有非能生因，而因緣種勝顯故偏說。	Even though there are causes in the two causes that are not productive causes, the seeds of direct results are predominant and manifest and for that reason are mentioned.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a09_11']	雖餘因內有非方便因，而增上者多顯故偏說。	雖餘因內有非方便因，而增上者多顯故偏說。	Even though there are causes in the remaining causes that are not facilitating causes, the dominant ones are manifest and for that reason are mentioned.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a11_8', 'ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a12_12']	有尋等地說生起因是能生因餘方便者，生起即是彼生起因，餘因應知即彼餘九。🔽雖生起中有非因緣種，而去果近親，顯故偏說。	有尋等地說生起因是能生因餘方便者，生起即是彼生起因，餘因應知即彼餘九。 雖生起中有非因緣種，而去果近親，顯故偏說。	The Bhūmi-vastu says that the productive cause is the productive cause and the others are the facilitating causes. The productive cause is the productive cause, and the other causes should be understood as the other nine.🔽Even though there are seeds in the productive cause that are not causes of direct results, they are close to the result and manifest and for that reason are mentioned.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a13_14']	雖牽引中亦有因緣種，而去果遠親，隱故不說。	雖牽引中亦有因緣種，而去果遠親，隱故不說。	Even though there are seeds of direct results in the projecting cause, they are distant from the result and hidden and for that reason are not mentioned.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a14_4']	餘方便攝，准上應知。	餘方便攝，准上應知。	The other perfuming conditions should be understood in the same way.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a14_13']	所說四緣依何處立？	所說四緣依何處立？	On the basis of which of the ten kinds of foundational consciousness are the four conditions established?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a15_4']	復如何攝十因二因？	復如何攝十因二因？	How are they included in the ten causes and two causes?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a17_1']	論說因緣依種子立，依無間滅立等無間，依境界立所緣，依所餘立增上。	論說因緣依種子立，依無間滅立等無間，依境界立所緣，依所餘立增上。	The treatise says that the condition as cause is established on the basis of seeds, the condition as object is established on the basis of the objective realm, and the dominant condition is established on the basis of the remaining ones.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a18_8']	此中種子即是三、四、十一、十二、十三、十五六依處中因緣種攝。	此中種子即是三、四、十一、十二、十三、十五六依處中因緣種攝。	Among these, seeds are included in the condition as cause of the third, fourth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth foundational conscious nesses.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a19_8']	雖現四處亦有因緣而多間斷，此略不說。	雖現四處亦有因緣而多間斷，此略不說。	Even though the other four foundational consciousnesses have the condition as cause, it is often interrupted and therefore is not mentioned here.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a20_8']	或彼亦能親辦自果如外麥等，亦立種名。	或彼亦能親辦自果如外麥等，亦立種名。	Or, like wheat, etc., in the external world, they are also called seeds because they are able to directly produce their own results.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a21_7']	或種子言唯屬第四，親疎隱顯取捨如前。	或種子言唯屬第四，親疎隱顯取捨如前。	Or, the term seeds refers only to the fourth foundational consciousness, and the reasons for this are as before.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a23_7']	言無間滅境界處者，應知總顯二緣依處非唯五六，餘依處中亦有中間二緣義故。	言無間滅境界處者，應知總顯二緣依處非唯五六，餘依處中亦有中間二緣義故。	The phrase the immediately antecedent state of mind that has perished and the objective realm should be understood as generally indicating the two conditions and their ten foundational natures, not only the fifth and sixth. This is because the remaining foundational natures also have the meaning of the two conditions of the immediately antecedent and the condition as object.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a24_7']	或唯五六，餘處雖有而少隱故略不說之。	或唯五六，餘處雖有而少隱故略不說之。	Or there are only five or six. Although other places have more, they are hidden and are not mentioned.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a25_15']	論說因緣能生因攝，增上緣性即方便因，中間二緣攝受因攝。	論說因緣能生因攝，增上緣性即方便因，中間二緣攝受因攝。	The treatise says that the causal condition includes the productive cause, the dominant condition is the same as the expedient cause, and the middle two conditions are included in the supporting cause.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a26_15']	雖方便內具後三緣，而增上多，故此偏說。	雖方便內具後三緣，而增上多，故此偏說。	Although the expedient cause includes the latter three conditions, the dominant condition is predominant, so it is mentioned here.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a27_13']	餘因亦有中間二緣，然攝受中顯故偏說。	餘因亦有中間二緣，然攝受中顯故偏說。	The other causes also have the middle two conditions, but the supporting cause is prominent, so it is mentioned here.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a28_12']	初能生攝進退如前，所說因緣必應有果。	初能生攝進退如前，所說因緣必應有果。	The first productive cause is as discussed previously. The causal condition must have a result.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a28_17']	此果有幾？	此果有幾？	How many results are there?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042a29_3']	依何處得？	依何處得？	Where are they obtained?

['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042b01_12']	一者異熟，謂有漏善及不善法所招自相續異熟生無記。	一者異熟，謂有漏善及不善法所招自相續異熟生無記。	1. Ripened result, which is the good or bad dharmas that attract the ripening of one's own continuity, which is the indeterminate result of ripening.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042b02_16']	二者等流，謂習善等所引同類，或似先業後果隨轉。	二者等流，謂習善等所引同類，或似先業後果隨轉。	2. Similar result, which is the same kind attracted by the practice of good, etc., or the subsequent result that resembles previous karma.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042b03_16']	三者離繫，謂無漏道斷障所證善無為法。	三者離繫，謂無漏道斷障所證善無為法。	3. Dissociated result, which is the good unconditioned dharmas realized by the uncontaminated path in cutting off hindrances.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042b04_15']	四者士用，謂諸作者假諸作具所辦事業。	四者士用，謂諸作者假諸作具所辦事業。	The fourth is the effect of human action, which is the work accomplished by the doer through the use of various tools.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042b05_11']	五者增上，謂除前四餘所得果。	五者增上，謂除前四餘所得果。	The fifth is the effect of dominance, which is the remaining effects not included in the former four.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042b08_4']	《瑜伽》等說習氣依處得異熟果，隨順依處得等流果，真見依處得離繫果，士用依處得士用果，所餘依處得增上果。	《瑜伽》等說習氣依處得異熟果，隨順依處得等流果，真見依處得離繫果，士用依處得士用果，所餘依處得增上果。	The Yogācārabhūmi Sāstra and other texts say that the causal condition that is the seeds of perfuming produces the retribution result, the causal condition that is the support of similar and immediately antecedent states produces the similar result, the causal condition that is the correct view produces the result of separation, the causal condition that is the dominant condition produces the effect of dominance.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0042b13_4']	習氣處言顯諸依處感異熟果一切功能，隨順處言顯諸依處引等流果一切功能，真見處言顯諸依處證離繫果一切功能，士用處言顯諸依處招士用果一切功能，所餘處言顯諸依處得增上果一切功能。	習氣處言顯諸依處感異熟果一切功能，隨順處言顯諸依處引等流果一切功能，真見處言顯諸依處證離繫果一切功能，士用處言顯諸依處招士用果一切功能，所餘處言顯諸依處得增上果一切功能。	The words causal condition that is the seeds of perfuming indicate the power of all causal conditions to summon retribution results. The words causal condition that is the support of similar and immediately antecedent states indicate the power of all causal conditions to summon similar results. The words causal condition that is the correct view indicate the power of all causal conditions to summon the result of separation. The words causal condition that is the effect of human action indicate the power of all causal conditions to summon the effect of human action. The words causal condition that is the dominant condition indicate the power of all causal conditions to summon the effect of dominance.

['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c02_1']	由此一切順現受業、別助當業，皆非行支。	由此一切順現受業、別助當業，皆非行支。	Consequently, all actions whose results are experienced in the present life and all actions that assist in the production of future results are not members of the chain that constitute the karmic forces.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c03_13']	二所引支，謂本識內親生當來異熟果攝識等五種，是前二支所引發故。	二所引支，謂本識內親生當來異熟果攝識等五種，是前二支所引發故。	The second is the members that are projected, i.e., the seeds of the five results, consciousness, etc., that are included in the store consciousness and that are born with it. They are projected by the first two members.

The seeds of consciousness as retribution are included in name-and-form.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c10_19']	經說識支通能所引業種識種，俱名識故，識是名色依，非名色攝故。	經說識支通能所引業種識種，俱名識故，識是名色依，非名色攝故。	A scripture says that the member of consciousness is both that which is projected and that which projects, because both the seeds of action and the seeds of consciousness are called consciousness, and because consciousness is the support of name-and-form, but is not itself included in name-and-form.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c12_17']	識等五種由業熏發雖實同時，而依主伴總別勝劣因果相異，故諸聖教假說前後。	識等五種由業熏發雖實同時，而依主伴總別勝劣因果相異，故諸聖教假說前後。	Even though the five seeds of consciousness, etc., are really simultaneous, being perfumed and producing by action, they are said to be in a temporal sequence in the holy teachings because of differences of master and servant, totality and particularity, superiority and inferiority, and cause and effect.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c13_16']	或依當來現起分位有次第故，說有前後。	或依當來現起分位有次第故，說有前後。	Or, they are said to be in a temporal sequence because of a sequence in the future actual state.

Ignorance of external dominant results produces craving for objects of the six sense consciousnesses. Craving in turn produces the four kinds of grasping. Craving and grasping together moisten the seeds of action and the seeds that are attracted by those actions, and this is called becoming, because it is close to having a later result.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c22_15']	有處唯說業種名有，此能正感異熟果故。	有處唯說業種名有，此能正感異熟果故。	Some sources say that only the seeds of action are called becoming, because they are able to directly summon retribution.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c23_15']	復有唯說五種名有，親生當來識等種故。	復有唯說五種名有，親生當來識等種故。	Some sources say that only the five seeds are called becoming, because they are close to producing the future consciousness, etc.

['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c26_15']	謂從中有至本有中未衰變來皆生支攝，諸衰變位總名為老，身壞命終乃名為死。	謂從中有至本有中未衰變來皆生支攝，諸衰變位總名為老，身壞命終乃名為死。	That is, from the intermediate existence until the present existence, before the stage of decay, this is called the member of birth. All stages of decay are generally called old age, and the end of life and the breaking up of the body are called death.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c27_7']	老非定有、附死立支。	老非定有、附死立支。	Old age is not definitely existent and is added to death to make a member.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c27_12']	病何非支？	病何非支？	Why is illness not a member?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c27_17']	不遍定故。	不遍定故。	Because it is neither universal nor fixed.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c29_7']	老雖不定，遍故立支，諸界趣生除中夭者，將終皆有衰朽行故。	老雖不定，遍故立支，諸界趣生除中夭者，將終皆有衰朽行故。	Although old age is not fixed, it is universal and therefore established as a member, because all worlds, destinies, and forms of birth have decay and death except for those who die prematurely.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0043c29_17']	名色不遍，何故立支？	名色不遍，何故立支？	Name-and-form is not universal. Why is it established as a member?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a02_1']	定故立支，胎卵濕生者六處未滿定有名色故。	定故立支，胎卵濕生者六處未滿定有名色故。	Because it is fixed. For those born from wombs, embryos, or moisture, before the six sense bases are complete, name-and-form is fixed.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a04_1']	又名色支亦是遍有，有色化生初受生位，雖具五根而未有用，爾時未名六處支故。	又名色支亦是遍有，有色化生初受生位，雖具五根而未有用，爾時未名六處支故。	Also, the member of name-and-form is also universally existent. For those born by transformation in the realm of form, although they have the five sense organs at the time of first receiving life, they are not yet functioning, and at that time it is not called the member of the six sense bases.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a05_4']	初生無色雖定有意根而不明了，未名意處故。	初生無色雖定有意根而不明了，未名意處故。	Although those who are first born in the formless realm definitely have the mental faculty, it is not clear, and it is not called the mental sense base.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a06_4']	由斯論說十二有支一切一分上二界有。	由斯論說十二有支一切一分上二界有。	Therefore the treatise says that the twelve members all exist in the upper two realms in part.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a06_14', 'ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a07_4']	愛非遍有，寧別立支？🔽生惡趣者不愛彼故。	愛非遍有，寧別立支？ 生惡趣者不愛彼故。	Craving is not universal. Why is it separately established as a member?🔽Because it is fixed. Those born in evil destinies do not crave them.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a08_5']	定故別立，不求無有，生善趣者定有愛故。	定故別立，不求無有，生善趣者定有愛故。	Those born in good destinies definitely have craving and do not seek nonexistence.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a09_6']	不還潤生，愛雖不起，然如彼取，定有種故。	不還潤生，愛雖不起，然如彼取，定有種故。	Although the love that nourishes rebirth does not occur in nonreturners, still, like the grasping that occurs in them, it definitely exists in seeds.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a10_5']	又愛亦遍，生惡趣者於現我境亦有愛故。	又愛亦遍，生惡趣者於現我境亦有愛故。	Also, love is universal, because those who are born in evil destinies have love for their present bodies.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a11_7']	依無希求惡趣身愛，經說非有，非彼全無。	依無希求惡趣身愛，經說非有，非彼全無。	The scriptures say that love does not exist in evil destinies, but this refers to the absence of love that seeks a body in evil destinies, not to the total absence of love.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a12_6']	何緣所生立生老死，所引別立識等五支？	何緣所生立生老死，所引別立識等五支？	Why are birth and old age and death established as that which is produced, and why are the five members of consciousness, etc., established as that which projects?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a13_6']	因位難知差別相故，依當果位別立五支。	因位難知差別相故，依當果位別立五支。	Because the characteristics of the causal state are difficult to know, the five members are established separately on the basis of the future effects.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a15_14']	謂續生時因識相顯，次根未滿名色相增，次根滿時六處明盛，依斯發觸因觸起受，爾時乃名受果究竟。	謂續生時因識相顯，次根未滿名色相增，次根滿時六處明盛，依斯發觸因觸起受，爾時乃名受果究竟。	That is, at the time of the linking of conception, the characteristics of consciousness are evident. Next, when the sense organs are not yet complete, the characteristics of name-and-form increase. Next, when the sense organs are complete, the six sense bases are bright and flourishing. On the basis of this, contact arises, and because of contact, feeling occurs. At that time, it is said that the experience of the effect is finally completed.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a17_7']	依此果位立因為五，果位易了差別相故，總立二支以顯三苦。	依此果位立因為五，果位易了差別相故，總立二支以顯三苦。	On the basis of this state of effect, the five causes are established. Because the characteristics of the state of effect are easy to understand, two members are established in summary to reveal the three kinds of suffering.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a18_7']	然所生果若在未來，為生厭故說生老死；	然所生果若在未來，為生厭故說生老死；	However, if the effect that is produced is in the future, birth, old age, and death are mentioned in order to generate aversion.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a19_9']	若至現在，為令了知分位相生，說識等五。	若至現在，為令了知分位相生，說識等五。	When it reaches the present, in order to make one understand the arising of the characteristics of the state, it is said that the five, consciousness, etc., are established.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a20_8']	何緣發業總立無明，潤業位中別立愛取？	何緣發業總立無明，潤業位中別立愛取？	Why is it that in the stage of projecting the cause of birth, ignorance is established in general, and in the stage of nourishing the cause of birth, craving and grasping are established separately?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a22_9']	雖諸煩惱皆能發潤，而發業位無明力增，以具十一殊勝事故，謂所緣等，廣如經說。	雖諸煩惱皆能發潤，而發業位無明力增，以具十一殊勝事故，謂所緣等，廣如經說。	Even though all passions are able to project and nourish, still in the stage of projecting the cause of birth, the power of ignorance is dominant, because it is endowed with eleven kinds of superiority, such as the object, etc., as is extensively explained in the scriptures.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a23_17']	於潤業位愛力偏增，說愛如水能沃潤故，要數溉灌方生有芽。	於潤業位愛力偏增，說愛如水能沃潤故，要數溉灌方生有芽。	In the stage of nourishing the cause of birth, the power of craving is dominant, because it is said that craving is like water that can moisten. It is necessary to water frequently before the sprout of existence can be born.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a24_17']	且依初後分愛取二，無重發義立一無明。	且依初後分愛取二，無重發義立一無明。	Moreover, it is only in the first and last of the two, craving and grasping, that there is the meaning of repeated projection, and therefore one ignorance is established.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a26_1']	雖取支中攝諸煩惱，而愛潤勝，說是愛增。	雖取支中攝諸煩惱，而愛潤勝，說是愛增。	Even though the member of grasping includes all passions, still craving is the most important, and therefore it is said that craving increases.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a27_10']	諸緣起支皆依自地，有所發行依他無明，如下無明發上地行。	諸緣起支皆依自地，有所發行依他無明，如下無明發上地行。	All members of conditioned arising are based on their own stages, but in the case of the performance of action, it is based on the ignorance of another stage, just as the ignorance of a lower stage projects the action of a superior stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044a29_1']	不爾，初伏下地染者所起上定應非行支，彼地無明猶未起故。	不爾，初伏下地染者所起上定應非行支，彼地無明猶未起故。	If it were not so, then the superior samādhi produced by one who has temporarily subdued the passions of a lower stage would not be a member of action, because the ignorance of that stage has not yet arisen.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b01_2']	從上下地生下上者，彼緣何受而起愛支？	從上下地生下上者，彼緣何受而起愛支？	When one is born in a lower or higher stage from a higher or lower stage, what feeling does one take as an object when one generates the member of craving?
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b02_1']	彼愛亦緣當生地受若現若種，於理無違。	彼愛亦緣當生地受若現若種，於理無違。	This craving also has as an object the feeling of the stage where one will be born, whether actual or as seeds. There is no disagreement with reason.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b03_17']	此十二支，十因二果定不同世，因中前七與愛取有或異或同，若二三七各定同世。	此十二支，十因二果定不同世，因中前七與愛取有或異或同，若二三七各定同世。	The ten causes and two results of the twelve members are definitely not the same in temporal period. The first seven members and the members of thirst, grasping, and becoming are sometimes the same and sometimes not. The second, third, and seventh members are definitely the same in temporal period.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b05_16']	如是十二一重因果足顯輪轉及離斷常，施設兩重實為無用，或應過此便致無窮。	如是十二一重因果足顯輪轉及離斷常，施設兩重實為無用，或應過此便致無窮。	In this way, one cycle of cause and effect of the twelve members is sufficient to show the turning of the wheel of death and rebirth and to avoid the errors of eternalism and nihilism. The establishment of two cycles is really useless, or else there would be an infinite regress.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b07_15']	此十二支，義門別者九實三假，已潤六支合為有故，即識等五三相位別名生等故。	此十二支，義門別者九實三假，已潤六支合為有故，即識等五三相位別名生等故。	As for the different meanings of the twelve members, nine are real dharmas and three are fictional, because the six members after thirst are combined to form becoming, and the five members of consciousness, etc., are distinguished according to different states of the three appearances of birth, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b08_20']	五是一事，謂無明、識、觸、受、愛五，餘非一事。	五是一事，謂無明、識、觸、受、愛五，餘非一事。	Five members are single events, i.e., ignorance, consciousness, contact, feeling, and thirst, because the remaining members are not single events.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b10_4']	三唯是染煩惱性故，七唯不染異熟果故，七分位中容起染故。	三唯是染煩惱性故，七唯不染異熟果故，七分位中容起染故。	Three members are only impure, because they are by nature passions. Seven members are only pure, because they are results as retribution. The seven states may contain impurity, because they may generate passions.
['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b10_14']	假說通二，餘通二種。	假說通二，餘通二種。	The remaining ten are of both kinds.

['ZH_T31_1585_008:0044b12_23']	六唯非色，謂無明、識、觸、受、愛、取，餘通二種。	六唯非色，謂無明、識、觸、受、愛、取，餘通二種。	Six are not form, namely, ignorance, consciousness, contact, feeling, craving, and grasping. The remaining ten are of both kinds.
