['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0309c29_0', 'ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a01_1']	此中四度云「見寶塔」，下文云「四番」即四悉🔽也。	此中四度云「見寶塔」，下文云「四番」即四悉 也。	In this, the four times say seeing the treasure stupa, the text below says four times refers to the four perspectives.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a02_4']	初世界中翻名有無三世不同，覩必歡喜故是世界。	初世界中翻名有無三世不同，覩必歡喜故是世界。	First, in the world, the names are different in the three periods of time, and seeing it necessarily brings joy, so it is the world.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a03_12']	言「經云佛三種身」者，借《普賢觀經》也，既結此經故可證同。	言「經云佛三種身」者，借《普賢觀經》也，既結此經故可證同。	It is said that the sutra says the Buddha has three kinds of bodies, borrowing the Sutra of Universal Worthy's Contemplation, since it concludes this sutra, it can be used as evidence.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a04_19']	「當佛亦然」者，未來有說《法華經》處，此塔還現、彼佛亦坐。	「當佛亦然」者，未來有說《法華經》處，此塔還現、彼佛亦坐。	The present Buddha is also like this means that in the future, wherever the Lotus Sutra is expounded, this stupa will appear again, and that Buddha will also sit.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a05_12']	本論亦云「此經為三身菩提故。	本論亦云「此經為三身菩提故。	The original treatise also says this sutra is for the enlightenment of the three bodies.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a06_13']	此經已說師弟因果，故古佛證、集分身佛。	此經已說師弟因果，故古佛證、集分身佛。	This sutra has already explained the causes and effects of the teacher and disciples, so the ancient Buddhas testify and gather the transformed Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a09_11']	」彼《華嚴經》加四菩薩說菩薩因果，能加但是迹佛主伴，故不假集佛，但云十方互為主伴，仍不云伴是佛分身，但云眷屬而已。	」彼《華嚴經》加四菩薩說菩薩因果，能加但是迹佛主伴，故不假集佛，但云十方互為主伴，仍不云伴是佛分身，但云眷屬而已。	In that Flower Ornament Sutra, four bodhisattvas are added to expound the causes and effects of bodhisattvas. The one who adds is only the trace Buddha, the host and companions. Therefore, it does not require the assembly of Buddhas. It only says that the ten directions are mutually the host and companions, and still does not say that the companions are the emanations of the Buddha, but only calls them retinue.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a10_10']	文中諸品皆云「集諸菩薩」，注家云：	文中諸品皆云「集諸菩薩」，注家云：	In the various chapters of the text, it all says gathering the bodhisattvas. The annotator says:
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a10_20']	道非存亡，古今一揆。	道非存亡，古今一揆。	The Way is not about existence or non-existence. Ancient and modern are of one measure.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a12_13']	然則裂地踊塔以表雙林不滅，更延接影微顯丈六非生，故云「見寶塔品」。	然則裂地踊塔以表雙林不滅，更延接影微顯丈六非生，故云「見寶塔品」。	Then, splitting the earth and emerging from the stupa to illustrate the non-extinction of the twin trees, further extending and connecting the shadow slightly revealing the non-birth of the thirty-two feet, therefore it is called seeing the treasure stupa chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a14_1']	今謂古佛塔今佛坐，則表古今實道不生，未必預表雙林不滅。	今謂古佛塔今佛坐，則表古今實道不生，未必預表雙林不滅。	Now it is said that the ancient Buddha's stupa and the present Buddha's sitting place illustrate the non-birth of the real Way of the ancient and modern, and it may not necessarily prefigure the non-extinction of the twin trees.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a15_3']	一往觀之，謂今現佛入古滅佛之塔，表滅不滅。	一往觀之，謂今現佛入古滅佛之塔，表滅不滅。	Looking at it from one perspective, it is said that the present manifested Buddha enters the stupa of the ancient extinguished Buddha, illustrating extinction and non-extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a17_1']	今謂不然，古佛塔現示滅而不滅，釋迦入塔示生而不生，不生不滅故並坐表之。	今謂不然，古佛塔現示滅而不滅，釋迦入塔示生而不生，不生不滅故並坐表之。	Now, I say this is not so. The ancient Buddha's stupa appears to show non-extinction within extinction, and Śākyamuni enters the stupa to show non-birth within birth. Because of neither birth nor extinction, they are both seated to represent it.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a18_5']	集分身召本屬，乃顯舍那非成，豈唯丈六示滅他人？	集分身召本屬，乃顯舍那非成，豈唯丈六示滅他人？	Gathering the transformed bodies and summoning the original assembly reveals that Vairocana is not an accomplishment. How can it be said that only the twelve-foot Śākyamuni shows extinction to others?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a18_8']	問云：	問云：	A question is asked:
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a18_17']	大眾見塔為根為識？	大眾見塔為根為識？	Do the great assembly see the stupa with the faculties or with consciousness?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a19_3']	為塔令見？	為塔令見？	Is it the stupa that causes seeing?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a21_20']	廣約譬類以破自他，此深不曉經之大旨，三周之後縱有凡夫咸殊凡見，然《中論》觀法被末代鈍根，佛世當機何勞設此？	廣約譬類以破自他，此深不曉經之大旨，三周之後縱有凡夫咸殊凡見，然《中論》觀法被末代鈍根，佛世當機何勞設此？	Extensively using analogies to refute self and other, this deeply fails to understand the great purport of the sūtra. After the three periods, even ordinary beings all have extraordinary understanding, but the Zhong lun observes the Dharma and is applied to the dull faculties of the end times. Why bother setting this up for the primary audience of the Buddha's time?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a22_8']	消經觀行理合如然。	消經觀行理合如然。	The practice of contemplating the sūtra should be like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a23_8']	凡諸釋經若無通見，致令後學不閑宗途；	凡諸釋經若無通見，致令後學不閑宗途；	In all explanations of the sūtra, if there is no comprehensive understanding, it will cause later students to be unfamiliar with the fundamental path.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a24_1']	今正為證經旁論所表。	今正為證經旁論所表。	Now, it is precisely to testify to the sūtra and the side discussions that are represented.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a24_5']	有人問：	有人問：	Someone asks:
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a25_2']	召古佛、集分身，身何故多，塔何故一？	召古佛、集分身，身何故多，塔何故一？	Why are there many bodies in summoning the ancient Buddhas and gathering the transformed bodies, and why is there only one stupa?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a26_9']	今為答之，證經義足，故寶塔不多，合多寶願，故分身不一。	今為答之，證經義足，故寶塔不多，合多寶願，故分身不一。	Now, in order to answer this, the meaning of the sutra is complete, so the jeweled pagoda is not many, and in order to fulfill the vow of Prabhūtaratna, the transformed bodies are not one.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a27_4']	假令證經須集多塔，塔豈不多？	假令證經須集多塔，塔豈不多？	Even if it is necessary to gather many pagodas to certify the sutra, how could the pagodas not be many?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a28_10']	既能應現十方，信知塔亦非一，故分身是化、塔亦宜權。	既能應現十方，信知塔亦非一，故分身是化、塔亦宜權。	Since they are able to manifest in the ten directions, we can be sure that the pagodas are also not one. Therefore, the transformed bodies are provisional, and the pagodas should also be expedient.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310a29_12']	今從所表，今佛一身而集多身，密表迹用之非一；	今從所表，今佛一身而集多身，密表迹用之非一；	Now, following what is represented, the present Buddha's single body gathers many bodies, secretly representing that the provisional functions are not one;
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b02_8']	古佛多塔但示一塔，顯表實理之不二，況從地在空及諸校飾，悉非徒爾。	古佛多塔但示一塔，顯表實理之不二，況從地在空及諸校飾，悉非徒爾。	The ancient Buddha's many pagodas only show one pagoda, explicitly representing that the true principle is non-dual. Moreover, the location in space and all the adornments are not just for nothing.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b04_3']	「明顯此事」者，三世諸佛轉法輪等，皆至法華出世事說，故今經文加四支徵。	「明顯此事」者，三世諸佛轉法輪等，皆至法華出世事說，故今經文加四支徵。	To make this matter clear means that the buddhas of the three times turning the wheel of the Dharma and so forth all reach the Lotus Sutra when speaking of worldly matters, so the present sutra text adds the four limbs to investigate.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b05_1']	「瓔珞」下為人者，以校量福為生善也。	「瓔珞」下為人者，以校量福為生善也。	Necklaces and so forth are for benefiting people, taking the comparison of blessings to generate goodness.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b05_20']	「善吉問」等者，第九〈供養舍利品〉云：	「善吉問」等者，第九〈供養舍利品〉云：	Subhūti's question and so forth, the ninth chapter Chapter on Making Offerings to the Relics says:
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b06_12']	「佛因善吉問供養全碎生法同耶別耶？	「佛因善吉問供養全碎生法同耶別耶？	The Buddha, due to Subhūti's question, compared the merit of making offerings to the whole and broken relics and the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b07_1']	佛廣校量云：	佛廣校量云：	The Buddha extensively compared them, saying:
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b08_13']	如供養一佛舍利起塔滿一四天下，不如供養生身，由色身有舍利故。	如供養一佛舍利起塔滿一四天下，不如供養生身，由色身有舍利故。	It is not as good as making offerings to the physical body, because the relics exist due to the physical body.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b10_5']	又起塔滿大千供養色身，不如供養法身，由法身有色身故。	又起塔滿大千供養色身，不如供養法身，由法身有色身故。	Moreover, it is not as good as making offerings to the Dharma body, because the physical body exists due to the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b12_3']	」當知見色不及聞經，以由聞經有法身故，故經偏圓即法身全碎功德不等。	」當知見色不及聞經，以由聞經有法身故，故經偏圓即法身全碎功德不等。	One should know that seeing the physical body is not as good as hearing the sūtra, because the Dharma body exists due to hearing the sūtra. Therefore, the merit of the sūtra being partial or complete is not the same as the merit of the Dharma body being whole or broken.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b13_12']	「頂王」等者，曾檢《大乘頂王經》及《方等頂王經》各一卷，並未見此。	「頂王」等者，曾檢《大乘頂王經》及《方等頂王經》各一卷，並未見此。	The King of the Peak and so on, I have searched through the Mahāyāna Sūtra of the King of the Peak and the Vaipulya Sūtra of the King of the Peak, each one fascicle, and have not seen this.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b14_10']	難意者，教與舍利時同益同，何得不等？	難意者，教與舍利時同益同，何得不等？	The difficulty is that the teaching and the relics are the same in time and benefit, so why are they not equal?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b15_4']	答意者，舍利時等亦生身之力。	答意者，舍利時等亦生身之力。	The meaning of the answer is that the relics are the same in time, but they are also the power of the physical body.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b16_4']	「北地師」下破謬斥非，義當破惡，即對治也。	「北地師」下破謬斥非，義當破惡，即對治也。	The Northern School below refutes errors and exposes fallacies, the meaning corresponds to destroying evil, which is the counteractive [teaching].
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b16_19']	「云說經竟」者，意云正經已畢。	「云說經竟」者，意云正經已畢。	It is said that the sutra is finished means that the main sutra has already ended.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b17_17']	「地師」去表身不二，以稱理故屬第一義也。	「地師」去表身不二，以稱理故屬第一義也。	The Northern School below shows that the body is non-dual, because it accords with principle, it belongs to the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b18_7']	「釋論」下證地師非。	「釋論」下證地師非。	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra below proves that the Northern School is wrong.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b18_16']	「師言」，南嶽也。	「師言」，南嶽也。	The teacher says refers to Nanyue.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b19_7']	雖云三身，意將法報以斥地師。	雖云三身，意將法報以斥地師。	Although it is said that there are three bodies, the meaning is to use the Dharma-body and reward-body to refute the Northern School.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b20_5']	「無來」者不合東來，「無出」者不應踊出。	「無來」者不合東來，「無出」者不應踊出。	No coming means it does not correspond to coming from the east, no leaving means it should not emerge.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b20_16']	「巍巍」者，不應塔內。	「巍巍」者，不應塔內。	Awe-inspiring means it should not be inside the stupa.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b21_3']	「應身」者，不應唯此。	「應身」者，不應唯此。	Response body means it should not be only this.

['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b23_8']	尚非應身，豈具三身？	尚非應身，豈具三身？	It is not even the response body, how could it possess the three bodies?
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b24_3']	故知多寶是法身者，未盡經旨。	故知多寶是法身者，未盡經旨。	Therefore, it should be known that regarding Prabhūtaratna as the Dharma body, one has not fully understood the purport of the sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b25_3']	「秖是表示」等者，秖以釋迦等事表理可也。	「秖是表示」等者，秖以釋迦等事表理可也。	It is only the manifestation and so on means that it is acceptable to use the events of Śākyamuni and so on to manifest the principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b26_6']	故知非直來證乃表經常，故多寶表法及具三身。	故知非直來證乃表經常，故多寶表法及具三身。	Therefore, it should be known that it is not only the coming and the proof, but also the constant manifestation of the sūtra. Therefore, Prabhūtaratna manifests the Dharma and possesses the three bodies.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310b27_1']	多寶久滅今出證經，生不生也；	多寶久滅今出證經，生不生也；	Prabhūtaratna, who has long been extinguished, now appears to prove the sūtra, manifesting birth and non-birth.

['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310c12_3']	初文又二：	初文又二：	The first text is also in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310c12_13']	先明塔出，證前起後。	先明塔出，證前起後。	First, it clarifies the emergence of the stupa, verifying the past and initiating the future.

['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310c14_2']	故二文皆以證前當約教，起後當本迹。	故二文皆以證前當約教，起後當本迹。	Therefore, both texts use [the Buddha's] testimony to prove the previous [part on] the provisional and real, and to give rise to the subsequent [part on] the original and traces.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310c14_8']	初證前中二：	初證前中二：	The first [part on] proving the previous has two [parts]:
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310c15_7']	先約真實，次約大慧，以此二是多寶證詞。	先約真實，次約大慧，以此二是多寶證詞。	First, [the Buddha] uses the true to testify, and next, [the Buddha] uses the great wisdom to testify. This is because these two are the words of testimony by Prabhūtaratna.
['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310c15_11']	初文三：	初文三：	The first [part] has three [parts]:

['ZH_T34_1719_08d:0310c20_6']	初文者，既重述證秖可從略，故但云「真實」，況處中及廣皆約所非，所非必多、能非唯一，故三周中雖或四一、若十若多，不出實相。	初文者，既重述證秖可從略，故但云「真實」，況處中及廣皆約所非，所非必多、能非唯一，故三周中雖或四一、若十若多，不出實相。	The first [part] states that since [the Buddha] repeats the testimony, he can only use the concise. Therefore, it only says the truth. Moreover, the middle [part] and the extensive [part] all discuss what is not [the truth].

The functioning of the resultant stage does not contradict principle. In the Śūraṃgama Samādhi, all kinds of samādhis are included. It is not the dhyāna seen at the time of the past causes. How could the relinquishment of attachments and so on transform over three thousand?

Therefore, it says, If one wishes to attain mastery, one should cultivate the spheres of mastery. If one wishes to attain vastness, one should cultivate the spheres of totality. If one only uses the small, one only uses the three thousand.

Therefore, these Buddhas gather to open the stūpa. When they gather, they do not arrive but only send their attendants to transmit greetings, etc., which is like giving consent. Therefore, the attendants only express their greetings and do not speak the words of giving consent.

The original purpose of the many treasures is to come to testify to the sutra, and the assembly should be allowed to see it. The Buddha's body represents the real, and the opening of the stupa represents the provisional, so opening the stupa represents opening the provisional, and seeing the Buddha represents revealing the real.
