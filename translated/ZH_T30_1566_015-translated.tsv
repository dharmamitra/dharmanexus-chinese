['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a11_7']	今此品者，亦為遮空所對治，令解涅槃無自體義故說。	今此品者，亦為遮空所對治，令解涅槃無自體義故說。	015	Now this chapter is also to refute the opposite of emptiness, in order to make one understand the meaning of the non-self-nature of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a12_5']	鞞婆沙人言：	鞞婆沙人言：	015	The Vātsīputrīya say:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a13_8']	彼先言，若一切非空，則無有起滅，此謂無自體義。	彼先言，若一切非空，則無有起滅，此謂無自體義。	015	They previously said, If all is not empty, then there is no arising or ceasing, which is called the meaning of no self-nature.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a14_2']	無自體者，如石女兒，則無起滅。	無自體者，如石女兒，則無起滅。	015	That which has no self-nature, like the son of a barren woman, has no arising or ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a14_14']	煩惱無自體故，非是起滅。	煩惱無自體故，非是起滅。	015	Because afflictions have no self-nature, they are not arising or ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a16_4']	而煩惱及名色因亦非起滅者，如上偈說「無斷苦證滅，復誰得涅槃？	而煩惱及名色因亦非起滅者，如上偈說「無斷苦證滅，復誰得涅槃？	015	And the causes of afflictions and name-and-form are also not arising or ceasing. As the above verse says, Without ending suffering and realizing cessation, who attains nirvāṇa?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a17_6']	」彼先已作此說者，我今欲得有所斷故證於涅槃。	」彼先已作此說者，我今欲得有所斷故證於涅槃。	015	They have previously made this statement, but I now wish to attain something to be ended and thus realize nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a17_11']	如經所說：	如經所說：	015	As the sutra says:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a18_2']	「染與染者共起煩惱。	「染與染者共起煩惱。	015	The defiled and the defiler arise together with afflictions.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a18_12']	此盡滅故，名為涅槃。	此盡滅故，名為涅槃。	015	Because of their complete cessation, it is called nirvana.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a19_6']	如是涅槃，心得解脫，譬如燈滅。	如是涅槃，心得解脫，譬如燈滅。	015	In such nirvana, the mind attains liberation, like a lamp going out.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a19_20']	」得涅槃者，由煩惱有自體故。	」得涅槃者，由煩惱有自體故。	015	Those who attain nirvana do so because afflictions have their own substance.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a21_4']	如彼上說無自體者，若無煩惱體亦無涅槃，譬如石女兒。	如彼上說無自體者，若無煩惱體亦無涅槃，譬如石女兒。	015	As stated above, if there is no substance, then there is also no nirvana, like the child of a barren woman.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a23_6']	復次若以無自體為驗無得涅槃者，亦破得涅槃義，即是破於差別法體，是彼立義出因之過。	復次若以無自體為驗無得涅槃者，亦破得涅槃義，即是破於差別法體，是彼立義出因之過。	015	Moreover, if using the absence of substance as a reason to refute the attainment of nirvana also refutes the meaning of attaining nirvana, then it refutes the substance of distinct phenomena, which is a fault in their proposed argument.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a23_10']	論者言：	論者言：	015	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a23_15']	汝說不善。	汝說不善。	015	You say it is unwholesome.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a24_18']	諸法無自體者，如幻燈滅，是亦不違世諦智境界故。	諸法無自體者，如幻燈滅，是亦不違世諦智境界故。	015	The absence of inherent substance in phenomena, like an illusory lamp going out, does not contradict the realm of conventional wisdom.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a25_18']	無自體者，從無始因緣展轉而起，如幻如焰。	無自體者，從無始因緣展轉而起，如幻如焰。	015	That which has no inherent substance arises from beginningless causes and conditions, like an illusion, like a flame.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a26_8']	諸行無起，即是涅槃。	諸行無起，即是涅槃。	015	The non-arising of conditioned phenomena is precisely nirvana.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a27_2']	證得涅槃亦復如是，無有自體。	證得涅槃亦復如是，無有自體。	015	Attaining nirvāṇa is also like this, without any self-nature.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a27_16']	我亦不立無體體故，非立義過。	我亦不立無體體故，非立義過。	015	I also do not establish that which lacks self-nature as having self-nature, so it is not a fault in the meaning I establish.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a28_12']	上引石女為喻者，於第一義中得成。	上引石女為喻者，於第一義中得成。	015	The above analogy of a barren woman is established in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128a29_13']	汝執有自體義者，不可壞故，有所斷者不然。	汝執有自體義者，不可壞故，有所斷者不然。	015	The meaning of your assertion of having self-nature is indestructible, so the one who has something to be eliminated is not so.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b02_3']	以是故，若不見真實理而說有自體者，得涅槃義不成，法自體壞故。	以是故，若不見真實理而說有自體者，得涅槃義不成，法自體壞故。	015	For this reason, if one does not see the true principle and speaks of having self-nature, the meaning of attaining nirvāṇa is not established, because the self-nature of dharmas is destroyed.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b02_8']	是事云何？	是事云何？	015	How is this so?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b03_6']	汝向出因、立義、譬喻，三法皆不成故有過。	汝向出因、立義、譬喻，三法皆不成故有過。	015	Because the three factors you have brought up - the reason, the thesis, and the analogy - are all unestablished, there is an error.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b03_14']	復次鞞婆沙人言：	復次鞞婆沙人言：	015	Next, the Vātsīputrīya says:

['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b05_7']	無斷苦證滅，復誰得涅槃」者不然。	無斷苦證滅，復誰得涅槃」者不然。	015	Without eliminating suffering and realizing cessation, who then attains nirvāṇa? This is not so.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b05_14']	我今立有涅槃。	我今立有涅槃。	015	I now establish that nirvāṇa exists.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b05_20']	云何為涅槃？	云何為涅槃？	015	What is nirvāṇa?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b07_11']	謂第一義中諸行有自體，斷諸煩惱及滅名色而得涅槃故，非如駝角。	謂第一義中諸行有自體，斷諸煩惱及滅名色而得涅槃故，非如駝角。	015	It means that in the ultimate truth, all conditioned phenomena have their own nature, and by severing afflictions and extinguishing name-and-form, one attains nirvana, therefore it is not like a camel's horn.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b08_6']	涅槃不爾，有體有斷有滅有得故。	涅槃不爾，有體有斷有滅有得故。	015	Nirvana is not like this, because it has a nature, has something to be severed, has something to be extinguished, and has something to be attained.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b08_10']	論者言：	論者言：	015	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b09_7']	如先偈說「若一切非空，則無有起滅。	如先偈說「若一切非空，則無有起滅。	015	As previously stated in the verse, If all are not empty, then there is no arising or ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b10_10']	無斷苦證滅，云何得涅槃」者，此謂有自體，不可壞故。	無斷苦證滅，云何得涅槃」者，此謂有自體，不可壞故。	015	Without severing suffering and realizing cessation, how can one attain nirvana? This means that if something has its own nature, it cannot be destroyed.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b11_16']	自體者，若是自宗出因立喻有相似者，所成能成則為有力。	自體者，若是自宗出因立喻有相似者，所成能成則為有力。	015	As for its own nature, if in one's own doctrine, the reason given and the example cited are similar, then what is established and the means of establishment will have power.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b13_2']	而今無此力故，因與喻義亦不成，又亦違汝先所立義。	而今無此力故，因與喻義亦不成，又亦違汝先所立義。	015	But now this power is lacking, so the meaning of the reason and example is also not established, and it also contradicts your previously established meaning.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b13_18']	我今問汝所立涅槃，為是第一義諦？	我今問汝所立涅槃，為是第一義諦？	015	I now ask you, is the nirvana you establish the ultimate truth?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b14_3']	為是世諦？	為是世諦？	015	Or is it the conventional truth?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b14_18']	若欲得是第一義諦者，我今答之。	若欲得是第一義諦者，我今答之。	015	If you wish to make it the ultimate truth, I will now answer.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b15_3']	如論偈說：	如論偈說：	015	As stated in the treatise, in a verse it is said:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b16_0']	「無退亦無得，　　非斷亦非常，	「無退亦無得，　　非斷亦非常，	015	There is neither retrogression nor attainment, neither annihilation nor permanence,

['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b18_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	015	The commentary states:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b18_14']	此謂如是涅槃，我所欲得。	此謂如是涅槃，我所欲得。	015	This means that such nirvāṇa is what we wish to attain.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b21_1']	如汝所說，斷故滅故為出因等，斷諸煩惱得涅槃者，此等因義今皆不成，顛倒心故作如是說，義皆不然。	如汝所說，斷故滅故為出因等，斷諸煩惱得涅槃者，此等因義今皆不成，顛倒心故作如是說，義皆不然。	015	As you have said, because of cessation and extinction, it is the cause of liberation, and those who attain nirvāṇa by severing afflictions, these causal meanings are now all unestablished, because of speaking in this way with an inverted mind, the meaning is all incorrect.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b22_8']	復次諸執有涅槃者，或說涅槃是真實法，或說涅槃是施設法。	復次諸執有涅槃者，或說涅槃是真實法，或說涅槃是施設法。	015	Furthermore, those who cling to the existence of nirvāṇa, some say nirvāṇa is a real dharma, some say nirvāṇa is a nominally existent dharma.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b22_13']	二俱不然。	二俱不然。	015	Both are incorrect.

['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b26_18']	此謂涅槃有自體者，無驗可令信解。	此謂涅槃有自體者，無驗可令信解。	015	This means that for those who say nirvāṇa has its own essence, there is no evidence to make one believe and understand.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b27_11']	若令涅槃有體，即墮老死相。	若令涅槃有體，即墮老死相。	015	If you say nirvana has substance, then it would fall into the characteristics of old age and death.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b27_15']	何以故？	何以故？	015	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128b28_12']	無有體離老死相，亦無老相死相離體。	無有體離老死相，亦無老相死相離體。	015	There is no substance apart from the characteristics of old age and death, nor are there the characteristics of old age and death apart from substance.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c01_17']	小乘之人不欲涅槃有老死相，以是故，如我出驗，第一義中涅槃非是體，無老死相故，譬如石女兒。	小乘之人不欲涅槃有老死相，以是故，如我出驗，第一義中涅槃非是體，無老死相故，譬如石女兒。	015	The adherents of the Lesser Vehicle do not want nirvana to have the characteristics of old age and death. For this reason, my inference is that in the ultimate truth, nirvana is not a substance, because it lacks the characteristics of old age and death, just like the child of a barren woman.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c02_7']	是故汝宗因義不成。	是故汝宗因義不成。	015	Therefore, the reason in your thesis is not established.

['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c03_8']	復次今更與過。	復次今更與過。	015	Furthermore, I will now add another fault.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c05_5']	若汝不欲涅槃是有為，而欲得涅槃是無為者不然，無處有一物是體復是無為者。	若汝不欲涅槃是有為，而欲得涅槃是無為者不然，無處有一物是體復是無為者。	015	If you do not want nirvana to be conditioned, but want to say nirvana is unconditioned, that is not so, because there is no place where a single thing is both a substance and unconditioned.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c06_4']	今當立驗，涅槃非是體，無為故，譬如空華。	今當立驗，涅槃非是體，無為故，譬如空華。	015	Now I will establish an inference: Nirvana is not a substance, because it is unconditioned, like a sky flower.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c06_16']	復次更說其過，如論偈說：	復次更說其過，如論偈說：	015	Furthermore, I will explain another fault, as the treatise says in a verse:

['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c09_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	015	The explanation is as follows:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c10_4']	此謂體者，皆藉因得有施設，涅槃是體不得無因。	此謂體者，皆藉因得有施設，涅槃是體不得無因。	015	This means that all entities are established as existent by relying on causes. Nirvana is an entity and cannot be without a cause.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c11_15']	以是故此中出驗，涅槃非是體，無因能施設故，譬如兔角、多摩羅跋。	以是故此中出驗，涅槃非是體，無因能施設故，譬如兔角、多摩羅跋。	015	Therefore, in this case, a logical argument is presented: Nirvana is not an entity, because it cannot be established without a cause, like the horns of a rabbit or a tamāla leaf.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c12_13']	及修多羅人等言多摩羅跋者唐言赤銅葉：	及修多羅人等言多摩羅跋者唐言赤銅葉：	015	As for the Sūtra school's statement about tamāla leaves,

['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c14_12']	我今說涅槃者，但是無起，於世諦中施設有故，我所立者其義相應。	我今說涅槃者，但是無起，於世諦中施設有故，我所立者其義相應。	015	I now say that nirvana is simply non-arising, because it is established as existent in the conventional truth. The meaning of my position is consistent.

['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c18_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	015	The explanation is as follows:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c19_4']	鞞婆沙等分別涅槃是第一義善，以息煩惱為因。	鞞婆沙等分別涅槃是第一義善，以息煩惱為因。	015	The Vibhāṣā and others distinguish nirvāṇa as the highest good, taking the cessation of afflictions as its cause.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c20_8']	今汝義非如是體故，而言涅槃無體者，為無善等耶？	今汝義非如是體故，而言涅槃無體者，為無善等耶？	015	Now, your meaning is not like this in essence, yet you say that nirvāṇa has no essence. Do you mean it has no goodness, etc.?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c20_18']	義皆不然，譬如空華。	義皆不然，譬如空華。	015	All meanings are not so, like empty flowers.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c21_17']	若言涅槃無實無自體者，無如是驗能令開解。	若言涅槃無實無自體者，無如是驗能令開解。	015	If you say nirvāṇa has no reality and no essence, there is no such evidence that can cause understanding.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c22_14']	涅槃非無體者，汝之所說難令人解。	涅槃非無體者，汝之所說難令人解。	015	Nirvāṇa is not without essence, but what you say is difficult for people to understand.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c25_2']	復次鞞婆沙分別涅槃先有體後無體，以燈為喻者，此是顯示世間所解，以燈未滅時有體，滅已是無體。	復次鞞婆沙分別涅槃先有體後無體，以燈為喻者，此是顯示世間所解，以燈未滅時有體，滅已是無體。	015	Furthermore, the Vibhāṣā distinguishes nirvāṇa as having an essence before and no essence later, using the lamp as a metaphor. This shows what is understood in the world, that when the lamp has not yet gone out, it has an essence, but when it has gone out, it is without essence.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c26_13']	若汝計無體，同彼已滅燈者，如向偈說「若涅槃無體，云何是無因？	若汝計無體，同彼已滅燈者，如向偈說「若涅槃無體，云何是無因？	015	If you reckon it is without essence, the same as the lamp that has already gone out, as the previous verse says, If nirvāṇa has no essence, how can it be without a cause?
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c27_8']	」此謂如燈無體而有，因施設作燈。	」此謂如燈無體而有，因施設作燈。	015	This means that like the lamp, although without essence, it has a cause that is established as a lamp.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c28_6']	如是諸陰煩惱無體而有，因施設為涅槃。	如是諸陰煩惱無體而有，因施設為涅槃。	015	Thus, these aggregates and afflictions are without essence but exist, and are established as nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c28_11']	如論偈說：	如論偈說：	015	As the treatise verse says:
['ZH_T30_1566_015:0128c29_14']	「涅槃非無體，　　而不藉因者；	「涅槃非無體，　　而不藉因者；	015	Nirvāṇa is not without essence, nor does it depend on causes;
