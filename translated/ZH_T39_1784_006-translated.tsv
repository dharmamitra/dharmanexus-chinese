The stage of contemplation and practice subsumes the five categories of practice. The stage of similarity subsumes the ten stages of faith. The stage of partial realization subsumes the forty-one stages. The ultimate stage subsumes the stage of wondrous enlightenment.

['ZH_T39_1784_006:0041c06_5']	既就三德論於六位，須論六位皆即三德所攝之法，故云六位寧不備收。	既就三德論於六位，須論六位皆即三德所攝之法，故云六位寧不備收。	006	Since the six levels are discussed based on the three virtues, it is necessary to discuss how the six levels are all the dharmas included in the three virtues. Therefore, it says, How could the six levels not be completely inclusive?

The meaning of contemplation secretly accords with the identity of subject and object. The sutra king can be revealed here.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0041c18_16']	二、會同金光明示位。	二、會同金光明示位。	006	Second, demonstrating the stage by harmonizing with the Golden Light.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0041c20_13']	以帝慧王與金光明皆是法性當體之名，欲令經王統攝義顯，是故重安帝王之目。	以帝慧王與金光明皆是法性當體之名，欲令經王統攝義顯，是故重安帝王之目。	006	Because Emperor Hui and the Golden Light are both names for the essence of the Dharma nature, in order to make the meaning of the sutra king's comprehensive rule clear, the title of the emperor is重安重ly placed again.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0041c21_16']	今欲行者知此二名同詮法性，故持會同金等明位。	今欲行者知此二名同詮法性，故持會同金等明位。	006	Now, those who wish to practice should know that these two names both expound the Dharma nature, so the holding and assembly are the same as the gold, etc., and the stage.

Therefore, the name is explained next, and the essence is discussed separately, enabling one to transcend thoughts in the nature of dharmas and roam freely.

Therefore, only by explaining the name can one correspond to discerning the essence. The total retention of the Dharma is without words, and words manifest the total retention. This is what is meant.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0042a20_10']	既釋體名，又引經論證成體義，復約說證料簡於體，辨體之旨曲盡其妙，那言不立辨體章門？	既釋體名，又引經論證成體義，復約說證料簡於體，辨體之旨曲盡其妙，那言不立辨體章門？	006	Having already explained the name of the essence, it also cites sutras and treatises to prove the meaning of the essence.

Therefore, it says that the Dharma nature is neither permanent nor impermanent, yet is able to be permanent and impermanent. How is this not the three natures?
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0043c27_6']	修極三身與性冥故，故使三身各有三義，斯由性三互具成九，致令修三亦成九義。	修極三身與性冥故，故使三身各有三義，斯由性三互具成九，致令修三亦成九義。	006	Because the three bodies of the ultimate cultivation merge with the nature, therefore the three bodies each have three meanings. This is because the three natures mutually possess and form nine, causing the three of cultivation to also form nine meanings.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0043c27_16']	顯無別修，故論二九；	顯無別修，故論二九；	006	It manifests that there is no separate cultivation, therefore the treatise discusses the two nines;
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0043c28_6']	二無二體，秖是一九。	二無二體，秖是一九。	006	The two have no separate essence, they are just one nine.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0043c29_18']	九秖是三，三非定三、三秖是一，舉一不少、言九非多，修性圓妙其義如是。	九秖是三，三非定三、三秖是一，舉一不少、言九非多，修性圓妙其義如是。	006	Nine is just three, three is not definitely three, three is just one, mentioning one is not little, saying nine is not many, the meaning of the perfect and wondrous cultivation and nature is like this.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a01_8']	二、約二身即法故難思。	二、約二身即法故難思。	006	Second, in terms of the two bodies, it is difficult to conceive because they are identical to the Dharma.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a01_18']	上約離義，修性各三；	上約離義，修性各三；	006	Above, in terms of the meaning of separation, cultivation and nature each have three;
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a02_12']	今就合義，故以報化冥於法性。	今就合義，故以報化冥於法性。	006	Now, in terms of the meaning of combination, therefore, the reward and transformation bodies are merged with the Dharma nature.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a03_2']	二既即性，安可數知？	二既即性，安可數知？	006	Since the two are identical to the nature, how can they be counted?
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a04_5']	乃即八十應化之身壽不可計，是故四偈皆云釋尊。	乃即八十應化之身壽不可計，是故四偈皆云釋尊。	006	It is precisely the eighty transformed bodies whose lifespan cannot be measured. Therefore, the four verses all say Shakyamuni.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a05_4']	此意皆由果宗顯性，故使二身同法性壽。	此意皆由果宗顯性，故使二身同法性壽。	006	This meaning is all because the fruition principle manifests the nature, thus causing the two bodies to have the same lifespan as the Dharma nature.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a05_12']	三、託疑者彰失。	三、託疑者彰失。	006	Third, relying on doubts to show the loss.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a07_2']	信相若知果能顯體非常非無常、能常能無常，終不見短定謂之短。	信相若知果能顯體非常非無常、能常能無常，終不見短定謂之短。	006	If the faithful appearance knew that the fruition can manifest the essence as neither permanent nor impermanent, and can be permanent and impermanent, he would never see the shortness and definitely call it short.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a07_13']	二、約化事比況釋，二：	二、約化事比況釋，二：	006	Second, in terms of the expedient matter, using analogy to explain, there are two parts:
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a07_18']	初、立況。	初、立況。	006	First, setting up the analogy.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a07_23']	二、結釋。	二、結釋。	006	Second, concluding and explaining.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a09_12']	所言長短非法性者，其實長短全是法性，良由迷者定執長短、不識法性；	所言長短非法性者，其實長短全是法性，良由迷者定執長短、不識法性；	006	As for what is said about long and short not being the nature of dharmas, in reality, long and short are precisely the nature of dharmas. It is simply because the deluded cling to long and short and do not recognize the nature of dharmas;
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a10_15']	故於長短指非長短而為法性，若見法性必能長短。	故於長短指非長短而為法性，若見法性必能長短。	006	Therefore, in long and short, they point to what is not long and short as the nature of dharmas. If one sees the nature of dharmas, one will certainly be able to understand long and short.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a10_20']	二、顯得。	二、顯得。	006	Second, revealing what is attained.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a11_14']	若見此意者，指今立果為宗意也。	若見此意者，指今立果為宗意也。	006	If one sees this meaning, it refers to establishing the fruition as the main point.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a12_4']	此意若立，諸義皆成。	此意若立，諸義皆成。	006	If this meaning is established, all the meanings are accomplished.

['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a13_10']	修二性一而論三身，顯體之果正是報身，常義成也。	修二性一而論三身，顯體之果正是報身，常義成也。	006	Cultivating the two natures as one and discussing the three bodies, the fruition that manifests the essence is precisely the reward body, and the meaning of permanence is accomplished.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a13_19']	所顯之體豈非法身？	所顯之體豈非法身？	006	How could the essence that is manifested not be the Dharma body?
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a14_8']	非常非無常義成也。	非常非無常義成也。	006	The meaning of neither permanent nor impermanent is accomplished.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a15_3']	法報既合，應身赴機，無常義也。	法報既合，應身赴機，無常義也。	006	Since the Dharma and reward bodies are combined, the response body responds to capacities, and the meaning of impermanence is also accomplished.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a15_13']	此等義立，功由果證。	此等義立，功由果證。	006	The establishment of these meanings is due to the realization of fruition.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a16_2']	果為宗要，其義善成。	果為宗要，其義善成。	006	The fruition is the essential point, and its meaning is well accomplished.

['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a18_3']	《文句》云「應佛能為常與無常」，是則能常亦是應身。	《文句》云「應佛能為常與無常」，是則能常亦是應身。	006	The Wenju says, The responsive Buddha can be both permanent and impermanent, which means that the ability to be permanent is also the responsive body.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a18_17']	今文何故常屬於報，應唯無常？	今文何故常屬於報，應唯無常？	006	Why does the present text attribute permanence to the reward body and impermanence only to the responsive body?
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a18_19']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a21_7']	報應乃是法身常與無常二種之用，法身是體，性不偏屬，故法身云非常非無常，報身屬常，應屬無常。	報應乃是法身常與無常二種之用，法身是體，性不偏屬，故法身云非常非無常，報身屬常，應屬無常。	006	The reward and responsive bodies are the two kinds of functions of the permanent and impermanent Dharma body. The Dharma body is the essence, whose nature does not belong to either side, so the Dharma body is said to be neither permanent nor impermanent. The reward body belongs to permanence, and the responsive body belongs to impermanence.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a23_1']	而《文句》云應身能常者，以能現長，人天莫數，能彰法性常住之用，故云常耳。	而《文句》云應身能常者，以能現長，人天莫數，能彰法性常住之用，故云常耳。	006	As for the Wenju saying that the responsive body can be permanent, it is because it can manifest for a long time, and humans and gods cannot count it. It can manifest the function of the permanence of the Dharma nature, so it is said to be permanent.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a24_4']	若望報身，長短二應俱名無常，故與下釋義不相違。	若望報身，長短二應俱名無常，故與下釋義不相違。	006	If compared to the reward body, both the long and short responsive bodies are called impermanent, so it does not contradict the explanation below.

['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a26_15']	一、不能分別大小法體，故將三藏三種無為，曲解方等四德之果。	一、不能分別大小法體，故將三藏三種無為，曲解方等四德之果。	006	First, they cannot distinguish the essence of the great and small dharmas, so they interpret the three kinds of unconditioned dharmas of the Tripiṭaka in the Vaipulya sūtras as the four virtues of the fruit.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a27_15']	二、不知今經果宗顯體，果人果壽冥乎法性。	二、不知今經果宗顯體，果人果壽冥乎法性。	006	Second, they do not know that the present sūtra reveals the essence of the fruit, and the fruit of the person and the fruit of longevity are merged with the Dharma-nature.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a28_16']	法性既非常非無常，果人果法亦非常非無常。	法性既非常非無常，果人果法亦非常非無常。	006	Since the Dharma-nature is neither permanent nor impermanent, the fruit of the person and the Dharma of the fruit are also neither permanent nor impermanent.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044a29_17']	法性既能常能無常，果人果法亦能常能無常。	法性既能常能無常，果人果法亦能常能無常。	006	Since the Dharma-nature is able to be permanent and impermanent, the fruit of the person and the Dharma of the fruit are also able to be permanent and impermanent.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b01_16']	以果三身皆即性故，是故三身一一互具。	以果三身皆即性故，是故三身一一互具。	006	Because the three bodies of the fruit are all the nature, therefore the three bodies each possess the others.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b02_11']	古人迷此，故齊海滴判為無常。	古人迷此，故齊海滴判為無常。	006	The ancients were confused about this, so they judged the ocean drops as impermanent.

['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b08_8']	先且總舉滅惡生善。	先且總舉滅惡生善。	006	First, generally mentioning the elimination of evil and the cultivation of good.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b09_12']	宗既冥體，體之力用任運發生，能為群機滅惡生善。	宗既冥體，體之力用任運發生，能為群機滅惡生善。	006	Since the purport is in accord with the essence, the power and function of the essence spontaneously arise, able to eliminate evil and cultivate good for the various capacities.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b12_5']	若偏對者，力能滅惡、用能生善，以滅惡故力乃成功、以生善故用乃成德，故舉功德顯其力用，欲令易解故且偏言。	若偏對者，力能滅惡、用能生善，以滅惡故力乃成功、以生善故用乃成德，故舉功德顯其力用，欲令易解故且偏言。	006	If biased, power can eliminate evil and function can cultivate good, because of eliminating evil, power then accomplishes merit, and because of cultivating good, function then accomplishes virtue, therefore, mentioning merit to show its power and function, wanting to make it easy to understand, so for now speaking in a biased way.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b13_4']	若其盡理，力用功德一一皆能滅惡生善。	若其盡理，力用功德一一皆能滅惡生善。	006	If it is the complete principle, power, function, and merit, each and every one can eliminate evil and cultivate good.

Although adorned with immeasurable cultivated merits, cultivation is precisely inherent nature, so adornment has nothing to adorn. Understanding suffering to be precisely inherent nature, there is no suffering to eliminate, and one is then able to eliminate all suffering.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b20_2']	知樂即性，無樂可與，乃能遍與究竟樂也。	知樂即性，無樂可與，乃能遍與究竟樂也。	006	Knowing joy to be precisely inherent nature, there is no joy to bestow, and one is then able to universally bestow ultimate joy.

['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b27_19']	懺有三種，謂作法、取相、無生。	懺有三種，謂作法、取相、無生。	006	There are three kinds of repentance: ritual, visualization, and non-arising.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044b28_16']	無生為生，以二為助，是故能令貪瞋癡滅。	無生為生，以二為助，是故能令貪瞋癡滅。	006	Non-arising is the source, and the other two are aids. Therefore, it can extinguish greed, anger, and delusion.
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0044c01_10']	此三煩惱有通有別，今了通別同居一念頓照無生，兼事懺助無惡不滅。	此三煩惱有通有別，今了通別同居一念頓照無生，兼事懺助無惡不滅。	006	These three afflictions are both general and specific. Now, understanding the general and specific to be dwelling together in a single thought, suddenly illuminating non-arising, along with assisting through ritual repentance, there is no evil that is not extinguished.

['ZH_T39_1784_006:0046b01_8']	蓋論通教，須具三義：	蓋論通教，須具三義：	006	It is said that the Shared Teaching must have three meanings:
['ZH_T39_1784_006:0046b02_7']	一因果俱通、二因通果不通、三通別通圓。	一因果俱通、二因通果不通、三通別通圓。	006	First, cause and effect are both shared; second, the cause is shared but the effect is not shared; third, it is shared with the Distinct and the Perfect.
