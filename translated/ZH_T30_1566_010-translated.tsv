['ZH_T30_1566_010:0099a11_14']	而彼驗中立義言，諸行若常若無常者，是斷常過故。	而彼驗中立義言，諸行若常若無常者，是斷常過故。	But in that inference, the proposition is stated as follows: If conditioned things are either permanent or impermanent, this is the error of annihilationism or eternalism.
['ZH_T30_1566_010:0099a12_13']	有流轉者不然，而說諸行畢竟無有流轉。	有流轉者不然，而說諸行畢竟無有流轉。	It is not so that there is transmigration, yet it is said that conditioned things ultimately have no transmigration.

Therefore, it is called merit.
['ZH_T30_1566_010:0099c09_16']	非福者，謂作種種不善之事，能令眾生入諸惡道。	非福者，謂作種種不善之事，能令眾生入諸惡道。	Non-merit refers to creating various unwholesome things that can cause sentient beings to enter the evil paths.

Therefore, at the beginning of the chapter, it is said that karma united with its fruit is the cause of emergence. In the ultimate truth, the meaning of birth and death can be established, because there is bondage and liberation, and therefore the substance of birth and death exists.

['ZH_T30_1566_010:0099c25_7']	若業自體起已無間不壞，後方有壞者不然，墮常過故。	若業自體起已無間不壞，後方有壞者不然，墮常過故。	If the intrinsic nature of an action arises and immediately does not perish, and only later perishes, this is not so, because it would fall into the error of permanence.

['ZH_T30_1566_010:0099c28_6']	竹葦等一一剎那隨壞不住，後時相似相續斷者，於世諦中說壞耳。	竹葦等一一剎那隨壞不住，後時相似相續斷者，於世諦中說壞耳。	Bamboos, reeds, and so forth, each moment perishes and does not abide. Later, when the similar continuity is severed, in the conventional truth one speaks of perishing.
['ZH_T30_1566_010:0099c29_8']	若第一義中說業如竹葦等相續至受果者不然。	若第一義中說業如竹葦等相續至受果者不然。	If in the ultimate truth one speaks of an action like bamboos, reeds, and so forth, continuing until the fruition is received, this is not so.
['ZH_T30_1566_010:0100a01_14']	若言有業法自體先後俱不壞者，難令物解，汝非無過。	若言有業法自體先後俱不壞者，難令物解，汝非無過。	If one says that there is a dharma of action, whose intrinsic nature first, later, or simultaneously does not perish, it is difficult to make others understand, and you are not without error.
