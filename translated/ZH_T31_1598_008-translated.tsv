['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428a25_11']	若諸菩薩無少所施等者，謂諸菩薩一切有情攝為己體，通達自他平等性故。	若諸菩薩無少所施等者，謂諸菩薩一切有情攝為己體，通達自他平等性故。	If bodhisattvas have nothing to give, it means that bodhisattvas include all sentient beings in their own bodies, because they have realized the equality of self and others.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428a26_11']	彼行施時即菩薩施，故無少施，名能行施。	彼行施時即菩薩施，故無少施，名能行施。	When they practice giving, it is the bodhisattvas' giving, so there is nothing to give, yet they are called givers.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428a27_13']	又以一切所有財物施於一切，是故說名無少所施。	又以一切所有財物施於一切，是故說名無少所施。	Moreover, they give all their possessions to all, therefore it is said they have nothing to give.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428a29_2']	又所施物、施者、受者皆不可得，三輪清淨，是故說名無少所施。	又所施物、施者、受者皆不可得，三輪清淨，是故說名無少所施。	Moreover, the given objects, the giver, and the receiver are all unobtainable, and the three spheres are pure, therefore it is said they have nothing to give.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b01_7']	若諸菩薩於一切施都無欲樂者，此既遮言，是不樂義。	若諸菩薩於一切施都無欲樂者，此既遮言，是不樂義。	If bodhisattvas have no desire for any giving at all, this is a negation, meaning they do not delight in it.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b03_4']	於來求施，當施我施先施我施，此等一切皆無欲樂，唯樂攀緣安住涅槃而行惠施。	於來求施，當施我施先施我施，此等一切皆無欲樂，唯樂攀緣安住涅槃而行惠施。	When giving to those who come seeking, they give to me, they gave to me, they will give to me - none of these do they delight in. They only delight in taking as their object and abiding in nirvāṇa while practicing generosity.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b04_17']	若諸菩薩不信如來而行布施者，謂證法性自了自信而行惠施，非唯信他。	若諸菩薩不信如來而行布施者，謂證法性自了自信而行惠施，非唯信他。	If bodhisattvas do not believe in the Tathāgata and practice giving, it means they realize the nature of dharmas, have self-understanding and self-confidence, and practice generosity, not just believing in others.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b06_16']	若諸菩薩於惠施中不自策勵者，謂能任運常行施故不須自策，而能策他勸令施故。	若諸菩薩於惠施中不自策勵者，謂能任運常行施故不須自策，而能策他勸令施故。	If bodhisattvas do not spur themselves on in generosity, it means they can always practice giving spontaneously and do not need to spur themselves, but they can spur others and encourage them to give.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b08_2']	若諸菩薩無有暫時少有所施者，是一切時一切施義。	若諸菩薩無有暫時少有所施者，是一切時一切施義。	If bodhisattvas do not give a little for a short time, this means they give everything at all times.

Now taking the secret meaning, being free from the notion of flowing and scattering, means the samādhi of abiding in concentration while practicing giving.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b12_14']	若諸菩薩殟波陀慳者，殟波陀言，顯目生起、密詮拔足，今取密義拔除慳足而行惠施。	若諸菩薩殟波陀慳者，殟波陀言，顯目生起、密詮拔足，今取密義拔除慳足而行惠施。	If bodhisattvas are stingy like an oṃpāda, the word oṃpāda manifests as arising and secretly refers to the foot being pulled out, now taking the secret meaning of pulling out the foot of stinginess and practicing generosity.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b14_4']	若諸菩薩不住究竟者，不同一向趣寂聲聞安住究竟無餘涅槃。	若諸菩薩不住究竟者，不同一向趣寂聲聞安住究竟無餘涅槃。	If bodhisattvas do not abide in the ultimate, it is not the same as the śrāvakas who go only to quiescence and abide in the ultimate nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b15_12']	若諸菩薩於惠施中不自在轉者，謂令慳等施所治障不自在轉。	若諸菩薩於惠施中不自在轉者，謂令慳等施所治障不自在轉。	If bodhisattvas are not free in the turning of generosity, it means that they do not allow stinginess and other obstacles to generosity to turn freely.
['ZH_T31_1598_008:0428b17_3']	若諸菩薩不住無盡者，謂得圓滿無盡增上究竟佛果而不安住。	若諸菩薩不住無盡者，謂得圓滿無盡增上究竟佛果而不安住。	If bodhisattvas do not abide in the inexhaustible, it means that they attain the perfect, inexhaustible, supreme, ultimate Buddha fruit but do not abide in it.
