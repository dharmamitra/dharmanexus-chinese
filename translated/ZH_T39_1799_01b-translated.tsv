['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0834c24_7']	如來之身定是汝體，見汝面故，如汝心眼。	如來之身定是汝體，見汝面故，如汝心眼。	The body of the Tathāgata is definitely your body, because it sees your face, just like your mind and eyes.
['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0834c25_16']	設或不許佛身是汝，汝之心眼亦非是汝，便同前文，自非汝體也。	設或不許佛身是汝，汝之心眼亦非是汝，便同前文，自非汝體也。	If you do not allow the Buddha's body to be you, then your mind and eyes are also not you, which is the same as the previous text, that they are not your body.
['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0834c26_6']	三、根身互闕能知破。	三、根身互闕能知破。	Third, the refutation of mutual deficiency in the sense faculties.
['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0834c27_10']	「汝眼已知，身合非覺。	「汝眼已知，身合非覺。	Your eyes already know, but your body should not be aware.

['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0834c29_8']	身若有覺，眼必無知。	身若有覺，眼必無知。	If the body has awareness, the eyes must be without knowledge.
['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0835a01_3']	在一不在一，經文巧略故不言也。	在一不在一，經文巧略故不言也。	Being in one place and not being in one place, the text skillfully omits the words.

['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0835a14_7']	今雖通舉，要取後句法生心生以為據也。	今雖通舉，要取後句法生心生以為據也。	Although it is generally mentioned now, the key point is to take the latter phrase because dharmas arise, various minds arise as the basis.
['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0835a16_12']	「我今思惟，即思惟體實我心性，隨所合處，心則隨有，亦非內外中間三處。	「我今思惟，即思惟體實我心性，隨所合處，心則隨有，亦非內外中間三處。	I now contemplate, contemplating the essence of the mind is the true nature of the self. Wherever it combines, the mind follows and exists. It is also not in the three places of inside, outside, and in between.
['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0835a17_13']	」現今思惟，誠有緣慮，及推所止，三處元非。	」現今思惟，誠有緣慮，及推所止，三處元非。	The present contemplation truly has conditions and thoughts, and when investigating where it rests, the three places are originally not [the mind].
['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0835a19_6']	應知隨境而生，心與境合，境既不一，心亦隨多，頗合佛言，必無虛論。	應知隨境而生，心與境合，境既不一，心亦隨多，頗合佛言，必無虛論。	One should know that the mind arises following the objects, and the mind combines with the objects. Since the objects are not one, the mind also follows and is many. It mostly accords with the Buddha's words and must not be a false discussion.

['ZH_T39_1799_01b:0840b11_18']	故知今言不得漏盡，乃指不斷二障之漏，不證大乘羅漢也，況究竟無學，佛地始稱，故佛三號有阿羅訶也。	故知今言不得漏盡，乃指不斷二障之漏，不證大乘羅漢也，況究竟無學，佛地始稱，故佛三號有阿羅訶也。	Therefore, we know that the statement here about not being able to exhaust defilements refers to not cutting off the defilements of the two hindrances and not realizing the arhatship of the Great Vehicle, let alone the ultimate stage of learning, which is only called the stage of Buddhahood.

The eternally abiding true essence is precisely revealed through this, because the seeing and the seen conditions are ungraspable, originally the same as empty flowers, and originally the wondrous and luminous non-arising and non-ceasing.
