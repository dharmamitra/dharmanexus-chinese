['ZH_T35_1735_044:0833c23_4']	雖於一切品類宣說法中得大自在，而未能得圓滿法身現前證受，今精勤修習，已得圓滿，故有此來。	雖於一切品類宣說法中得大自在，而未能得圓滿法身現前證受，今精勤修習，已得圓滿，故有此來。	Although one has attained great mastery in the exposition of all kinds of teachings, one is still unable to fully realize and experience the manifestation of the Dharma body. Now, through diligent practice, one attains fullness, and therefore this ground appears.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0833c25_1']	論云「於九地中已作淨佛國土及化眾生，第十地中修行令智覺滿，此是勝故。	論云「於九地中已作淨佛國土及化眾生，第十地中修行令智覺滿，此是勝故。	The treatise states: In the ninth ground, one has already purified the Buddha-lands and transformed sentient beings. In the tenth ground, one cultivates to perfect the wisdom of enlightenment. This is superior,
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0833c26_3']	以八九二地同無功用故，對之顯勝，有此地來。	以八九二地同無功用故，對之顯勝，有此地來。	because the eighth and ninth grounds are the same in being effortless. In contrast to them, it shows superiority, and therefore this ground appears.

['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a01_11']	一喻智慧、二喻法身、三喻應身、四喻多聞熏因。	一喻智慧、二喻法身、三喻應身、四喻多聞熏因。	First, they metaphorically represent wisdom; second, they metaphorically represent the Dharma body; third, they metaphorically represent the response body; fourth, they metaphorically represent the cause of the perfuming of much learning.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a01_16']	空亦四義：	空亦四義：	Space also has four meanings:

['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a04_6']	《攝大乘論》云「由得總緣一切法智，含藏一切陀羅尼門三摩地門。	《攝大乘論》云「由得總緣一切法智，含藏一切陀羅尼門三摩地門。	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha-śāstra says: By attaining the cognition that universally cognizes all dharmas, it contains all dhāraṇī-gates and samādhi-gates.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a06_3']	」此喻含水義，總緣一切法契經等智，不離真如，如雲合空，總持三昧即是水也。	」此喻含水義，總緣一切法契經等智，不離真如，如雲合空，總持三昧即是水也。	 This metaphor illustrates the meaning of containing water. The cognition that universally cognizes all dharmas, such as the sūtras, is inseparable from true suchness, like clouds covering the sky. The dhāraṇīs and samādhis are the water.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a07_1']	又云「譬如大雲能覆如空，廣大障故。	又云「譬如大雲能覆如空，廣大障故。	It also says: It is like a great cloud that can cover the vast obstructions in the sky.

['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a09_19']	一喻霔雨義，即上之智出生功德，充滿所依法身故；	一喻霔雨義，即上之智出生功德，充滿所依法身故；	One metaphor is the meaning of pouring rain, which is the merit produced by the above wisdom, filling the dharmakāya that is relied upon;
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a10_14']	二喻遍滿，即前之智自滿法身耳。	二喻遍滿，即前之智自滿法身耳。	The second metaphor is the pervasiveness, which is the self-fulfillment of the dharmakāya by the previous wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a11_13']	故《金光明》云「法身如虛空，智慧如大雲。	故《金光明》云「法身如虛空，智慧如大雲。	Therefore, the Golden Light Sūtra says, The dharmakāya is like empty space, and wisdom is like the great clouds.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a12_10']	」《成唯識》中亦有三義，全同《攝論》。	」《成唯識》中亦有三義，全同《攝論》。	The Cheng Weishi Lun also has three meanings, which are completely the same as the She Lun.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a13_16']	而《瑜伽》云「麁重之身廣如虛空，法身圓滿譬如大雲皆能遍覆。	而《瑜伽》云「麁重之身廣如虛空，法身圓滿譬如大雲皆能遍覆。	However, the Yuqie Lun says, The body of coarseness is vast like empty space, and the dharmakāya is perfectly full, like a great cloud that can universally cover.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a14_8']	」此同《攝論》第二義。	」此同《攝論》第二義。	This is the same as the second meaning in the She Lun.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a15_11']	而無性釋以智覆空，此以法身者智滿，則法身圓滿。	而無性釋以智覆空，此以法身者智滿，則法身圓滿。	However, Wuxing's commentary uses wisdom to cover emptiness, while this uses the dharmakāya. When wisdom is fulfilled, then the dharmakāya is perfectly full.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a16_5']	《起信論》云「顯現法身智純淨故。	《起信論》云「顯現法身智純淨故。	The Qixin Lun says, Because the pure wisdom manifests the dharmakāya.

['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a17_6']	」亦以法身喻雲。	」亦以法身喻雲。	It also uses the dharmakāya as a metaphor for clouds.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a18_14']	真諦三藏釋《金光明經》云「虛空喻三法身，雲喻三道之智。	真諦三藏釋《金光明經》云「虛空喻三法身，雲喻三道之智。	The Tripiṭaka Master Paramārtha's commentary on the Golden Light Sūtra says: The sky is a metaphor for the three Dharma bodies, and the clouds are a metaphor for the wisdom of the three paths.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a19_16']	」此法喻亦齊，似非經意，此喻位極，非道前故。	」此法喻亦齊，似非經意，此喻位極，非道前故。	This metaphor is also equal, and does not seem to be the meaning of the sūtra. This metaphor is at the ultimate stage, and is not before the path.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a22_10']	《莊嚴論》第十三云「於第十地中，由三昧門及陀羅尼門，攝一切聞熏習因，遍滿阿梨耶識中，譬如浮雲遍滿虛空。	《莊嚴論》第十三云「於第十地中，由三昧門及陀羅尼門，攝一切聞熏習因，遍滿阿梨耶識中，譬如浮雲遍滿虛空。	The thirteenth chapter of the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras says: In the tenth stage, by means of the door of samādhis and the door of dhāraṇīs, all the causes of perfumed hearing are gathered and pervade the ālaya-vijñāna, like floating clouds filling the sky.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a25_1']	能以此聞熏習雲，於一一剎那、於一一相、於一一好、於一一毛孔，雨無量無邊法雨，充足一切所化眾生。	能以此聞熏習雲，於一一剎那、於一一相、於一一好、於一一毛孔，雨無量無邊法雨，充足一切所化眾生。	One is able to use these clouds of perfumed hearing to rain down immeasurable and boundless Dharma rain in each instant, in each mark, in each minor mark, and in each pore, and to satisfy all the sentient beings to be transformed.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a25_15']	由能如雲雨法雨故，故名法雲。	由能如雲雨法雨故，故名法雲。	Because one is able to rain down the Dharma rain like clouds, one is called 'Dharma Cloud.'
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a26_12']	」此從法身，未及佛故，立賴耶名。	」此從法身，未及佛故，立賴耶名。	 This is because it comes from the Dharma body, but has not yet reached Buddhahood, and so the name ālaya is established.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a27_9']	《十住論》云「於無佛世界，能雨法雨故。	《十住論》云「於無佛世界，能雨法雨故。	The Dashabhumika-vibhasa-sastra says, In worlds without Buddhas, it can rain the rain of Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a27_18']	」《瑜伽》又意云：	」《瑜伽》又意云：	The Yoga Sastra also says:
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a28_6']	言大雲者，未現等覺。	言大雲者，未現等覺。	As for the great cloud, it has not yet manifested perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a29_2']	若現等覺，能雨大雨作利益故。	若現等覺，能雨大雨作利益故。	If it has manifested perfect enlightenment, it can rain the great rain and bring about benefit.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834a29_14']	是則密雲不雨，含德而已。	是則密雲不雨，含德而已。	This means that the dense cloud does not rain, but contains virtue.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b02_4']	然諸釋雖眾，不出三義，謂以智慧含德、遍斷諸障、遍證法身。	然諸釋雖眾，不出三義，謂以智慧含德、遍斷諸障、遍證法身。	Although there are many explanations, they do not go beyond three meanings, namely, using wisdom to contain virtue, universally severing all obstructions, and universally realizing the Dharma body.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b04_8']	故所覆麁重即所離障，謂於諸法中未得自在障，此障十地大法智雲及所含藏所起事業故。	故所覆麁重即所離障，謂於諸法中未得自在障，此障十地大法智雲及所含藏所起事業故。	Therefore, the coarse and heavy that are covered are precisely the obstructions that are eliminated, namely, the obstruction to not yet attaining mastery over all dharmas. This obstruction is to the great Dharma wisdom cloud of the ten grounds, as well as the activities that arise from what it contains.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b05_17']	斯即二愚障所起業，名大神通愚障大智雲，即悟入微細祕密愚。	斯即二愚障所起業，名大神通愚障大智雲，即悟入微細祕密愚。	This is precisely the two kinds of delusion that obstruct the activities that arise, namely, the delusion of great spiritual powers obstructing the great wisdom cloud, and the delusion of subtle and secret realization.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b09_8']	斷此障故，便能證得業自在等所依真如，謂神通作業總持定門皆自在故，便成受位等行，具智波羅蜜，得化身三昧等果，即是雲雨究竟成佛法身。	斷此障故，便能證得業自在等所依真如，謂神通作業總持定門皆自在故，便成受位等行，具智波羅蜜，得化身三昧等果，即是雲雨究竟成佛法身。	By severing this obstacle, one is able to realize the suchness that is the basis for mastery over karma, etc. This means that because one has mastery over spiritual powers, activities, dhāraṇīs, and samādhis, one then accomplishes the practices of receiving empowerment, etc., perfects the pāramitā of wisdom, attains the fruits of the transformation body, samādhi, etc., and ultimately becomes a buddha with the Dharma body.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b10_6']	及所證如皆亦所遍虛空，其旨一耳。	及所證如皆亦所遍虛空，其旨一耳。	And the suchness that is realized also pervades empty space. The meaning is the same.

['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b17_4']	前二用益普周、後三隨見不等。	前二用益普周、後三隨見不等。	The first two functions benefit universally, and the last three show that the views are not equal.

['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b18_18']	初一智了世幻故，文有喻合；	初一智了世幻故，文有喻合；	The first one is the wisdom that understands the world is illusory, and the text has a metaphor and combination;
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b20_15']	後二證窮性相故，於中半偈證體、半偈起用、半偈用不離體、半偈體用泯絕。	後二證窮性相故，於中半偈證體、半偈起用、半偈用不離體、半偈體用泯絕。	The last two realize the nature and characteristics, and within that, half a verse realizes the essence, half a verse gives rise to function, half a verse shows the function is not apart from the essence, and half a verse shows the essence and function are both negated.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b21_15']	後三請中，初一結默念請、後二上首言請。	後三請中，初一結默念請、後二上首言請。	Among the last three requests, the first one concludes the silent thought request, and the last two are the foremost's verbal request.
['ZH_T35_1735_044:0834b22_4']	第二正說，論分八分：	第二正說，論分八分：	The second correct explanation is divided into eight parts by the treatise:
