The remainder of the food eaten by the inexhaustible precepts and samādhis🔽Clarifies that when the Buddha cultivated the causes of giving, he cultivated with an unrestricted mind, and therefore the fruition he now experiences is also unrestricted. The flavor of the treasury of all merits means realizing the principle through fragrance.🔽The middle way true aspect perfectly encompasses myriad practices, and therefore one attains this samādhi.
['ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c03_1', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c03_8', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c03_17', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c04_1', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c04_12', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c04_17', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c05_6', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c05_15', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c06_8', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c06_14', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c08_1', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c08_6', 'ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c08_10']	德無不具也。🔽即經云王三昧。🔽三諦三昧等皆異也。🔽又經云。🔽般若雖空一心具足萬行。🔽又大經云。🔽金剛寶藏無所缺減。🔽皆此三昧之異名也。🔽然後緣雖殊於法飯而悟理。🔽未易於真如。🔽故雖淨國之香亦以悟圓中道為三昧也　是殺生報者。🔽報有三種。🔽論頌云。	德無不具也。🔽即經云王三昧。🔽三諦三昧等皆異也。🔽又經云。🔽般若雖空一心具足萬行。🔽又大經云。🔽金剛寶藏無所缺減。🔽皆此三昧之異名也。🔽然後緣雖殊於法飯而悟理。🔽未易於真如。🔽故雖淨國之香亦以悟圓中道為三昧也　是殺生報者。🔽報有三種。🔽論頌云。	The merit of the Tathāgata's fragrant rice is therefore inexhaustible. The remainder of the food eaten by the inexhaustible precepts and samādhis refers to the Buddha's practice of giving with an unlimited mind in the past, and therefore now he has also attained an unlimited fruition. The taste of the treasury of all merits refers to realizing the principle through fragrance. The middle way true aspect is perfectly endowed with myriad practices, and therefore one attains this samādhi. Merit is not lacking. It is the samādhi of the king mentioned in the sūtra. The samādhi of the three truths and so forth are all different. The sūtra also says: Although prajñā is empty, the one mind is perfectly endowed with myriad practices. The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra also says: The adamantine treasure is without deficiency. These are all different names for this samādhi. Then, although the conditions are different from the Dharma meal, one realizes the principle. It is not easy to attain true suchness. Therefore, although the fragrance of the pure land is also used as the samādhi to realize the middle way of the perfect [truth], the retribution for killing refers to the three kinds of retribution. The verse in the treatise says:
['ZH_T85_2778_002:0532c08_16']	皆能招異熟。	皆能招異熟。	All can attract retribution.

The equal flow and dominant fruits, the equal flow retribution and dominant retribution, cause others to suffer and attract retribution. Because of cutting off life and destroying, cutting off life attracts equal flow, and destroying attracts dominant. Moreover, the ten evil retributions attract the three evil destinies.
