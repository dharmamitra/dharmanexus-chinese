['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539a14_14']	異熟非遍故不隨立。	異熟非遍故不隨立。	004	Because the nature of retribution is not universal, it does not follow in establishing.

['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539a26_12']	一切非得總有三種。	一切非得總有三種。	004	All non-acquisitions are generally of three kinds.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539a26_18']	一在彼法前。	一在彼法前。	004	First, prior to the dharma.

['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539a28_6']	所不得法亦有三種。	所不得法亦有三種。	004	The dharmas that are not acquired are also of three kinds.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539a28_14']	一唯有法前非得。	一唯有法前非得。	004	First, there is only non-acquisition prior to the dharma.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539a29_7']	謂未來情數等畢竟不生法。	謂未來情數等畢竟不生法。	004	This refers to dharmas that are ultimately unproduced, such as future sentient beings, etc.,
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b01_2']	及入無餘涅槃最後剎那心等。	及入無餘涅槃最後剎那心等。	004	and the final moment of mind, etc., of one who has entered nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b01_15']	二有法通有法前．法後非得。	二有法通有法前．法後非得。	004	Second, there is non-acquisition that is both prior to and subsequent to the dharma.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b02_6']	謂餘隨所應有情數法。	謂餘隨所應有情數法。	004	This refers to other sentient beings and dharmas, as appropriate.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b03_4']	三有法無彼前後俱非得而有非得。	三有法無彼前後俱非得而有非得。	004	Third, there are dharmas that have neither prior, subsequent, nor simultaneous non-acquisition, yet still have non-acquisition.

['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b04_18']	是所得法必有得故。	是所得法必有得故。	004	the dharma that is acquired must have acquisition.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b05_8']	非所得法無非得故。	非所得法無非得故。	004	Because the dharma that is not acquired does not have non-acquisition.

['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b07_14']	然諸非得性羸劣故唯成現在。	然諸非得性羸劣故唯成現在。	004	However, because the nature of all non-acquisitions is weak, they only exist in the present.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b08_4']	一一剎那得已即捨。	一一剎那得已即捨。	004	In each instant, having been acquired, they are immediately abandoned.
['ZH_T41_1822_004:0539b08_14']	於未得彼法及已捨位。	於未得彼法及已捨位。	004	In the state of not yet acquiring that dharma or having already abandoned it,
