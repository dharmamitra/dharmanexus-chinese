['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b07_8']	辯差別品第三之七緣與因義差別云何？	辯差別品第三之七緣與因義差別云何？	011	Chapter 3, Section 7: Distinguishing the Differences. What is the difference between conditions and causes?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b07_11', 'ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b08_17']	有說：🔽因緣遍不遍異，初四二緣攝六因故，二三二緣非因攝故。	有說： 因緣遍不遍異，初四二緣攝六因故，二三二緣非因攝故。	011	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b11_7']	六因四緣體雖無別而義有異，且等無間及所緣緣既非因攝，故知餘二義亦有殊，緣義等故、與因皆別故。	六因四緣體雖無別而義有異，且等無間及所緣緣既非因攝，故知餘二義亦有殊，緣義等故、與因皆別故。	011	The difference lies in whether they are universal or non-universal conditions. The first four are subsumed by the two conditions, because the six causes are included. The second and third are not subsumed by the causes, therefore they are known to be different in meaning from the other two. Because the meaning of conditions is the same, and because they are all different from causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b12_15']	有總辯因緣異，言因謂能生，緣能長養，猶如生養二母差別。	有總辯因緣異，言因謂能生，緣能長養，猶如生養二母差別。	011	There is a general distinction between causes and conditions, saying that causes are what gives rise, and conditions are what nurtures and grows, like the difference between the two mothers who give birth and raise.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b13_15']	又緣攝助因方能生，生已相續，緣力長養故。	又緣攝助因方能生，生已相續，緣力長養故。	011	Moreover, conditions assist causes so that they can give rise, and after arising, they continue in succession. The power of conditions nurtures and grows.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b13_19']	或有說：	或有說：	011	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b14_18']	因唯有一，緣乃眾多，猶如種子糞土等異。	因唯有一，緣乃眾多，猶如種子糞土等異。	011	Causes are only one, while conditions are many, like the differences between seeds, manure, and soil.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b15_13']	又因不共，共者是緣，如眼如色。	又因不共，共者是緣，如眼如色。	011	Moreover, the cause is not common, while the condition is common, like the eye and form.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b16_11']	又作自事名因，若作他事名緣，如種糞等。	又作自事名因，若作他事名緣，如種糞等。	011	Moreover, that which performs its own function is called a cause, while that which performs the function of another is called a condition, like a seed and manure.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b17_10']	又能引起名因，能任持者名緣，如花如帶。	又能引起名因，能任持者名緣，如花如帶。	011	Moreover, that which can give rise to is called a cause, while that which can support is called a condition, like a flower and a ribbon.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b18_6']	又近名因，遠者名緣，如珠如日。	又近名因，遠者名緣，如珠如日。	011	Moreover, the proximate is called a cause, while the distant is called a condition, like a pearl and the sun.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b19_7']	又因能生，緣者能辦，如酪出生酥，人鑽器能辦。	又因能生，緣者能辦，如酪出生酥，人鑽器能辦。	011	Moreover, the cause is that which gives birth, while the condition is that which accomplishes, like curds giving rise to ghee, and a person churning with an implement accomplishing it.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b20_8', 'ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b21_12']	又正有義名因，能助顯發名緣，如字界字緣。🔽於義有差別，如斯等類差別眾多，是故因緣別立名想。	又正有義名因，能助顯發名緣，如字界字緣。 於義有差別，如斯等類差別眾多，是故因緣別立名想。	011	Moreover, that which has a direct meaning is called a cause, while that which can assist and manifest is called a condition, like the syllables and the syllables' conditions.🔽There are many such distinctions in meaning, therefore cause and condition are established as separate names and concepts.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b22_12']	此總意顯因親緣疎，故因緣中親疎數廣。	此總意顯因親緣疎，故因緣中親疎數廣。	011	The general meaning shows that the cause is close and the condition is distant, therefore the close and distant are frequently mentioned in the causes and conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b23_2', 'ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b23_15']	已隨理教略辯諸緣。🔽如是諸緣顯法生滅以為作用？	已隨理教略辯諸緣。 如是諸緣顯法生滅以為作用？	011	In accordance with principle and teaching, the various conditions have been briefly explained.🔽How do these conditions manifest the arising and ceasing of dharmas as their function?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b24_9']	應說何緣於何位法而興作用？	應說何緣於何位法而興作用？	011	It should be said for which stage of dharmas do the conditions function?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b24_12']	頌曰：	頌曰：	011	The verse states:
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b25_0']	二因於正滅，　　三因於正生，	二因於正滅，　　三因於正生，	011	The two causes function at the time of cessation, the three causes function at the time of arising,
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b26_13']	餘二緣相違，　　而興於作用。	餘二緣相違，　　而興於作用。	011	The other two causes function in opposition to the conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b27_2']	論曰：	論曰：	011	The treatise states:
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b28_19']	前說五因為因緣性，二因作用於正滅時，正滅時言顯法現在，滅現前故名正滅時。	前說五因為因緣性，二因作用於正滅時，正滅時言顯法現在，滅現前故名正滅時。	011	The previously mentioned five causes are the nature of causes and conditions. The two causes function at the time of cessation. The phrase at the time of cessation refers to dharmas in the present. Because cessation is present, it is called at the time of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824b29_18']	俱有、相應二因，於法滅現前位而作功能。	俱有、相應二因，於法滅現前位而作功能。	011	The two causes of co-existence and association function at the stage of the present cessation of dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c02_11']	此位二因作功能者，謂俱生品，隨闕一時作用皆無，不能取境於現在位。	此位二因作功能者，謂俱生品，隨闕一時作用皆無，不能取境於現在位。	011	The two causes function at this stage, referring to those born together. If either is lacking, the function is completely absent. They cannot take objects in the present stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c03_14']	如是二因雖俱一時取果與果，而今但約與果功能。	如是二因雖俱一時取果與果，而今但約與果功能。	011	Thus, although these two causes simultaneously take effects and give effects at the same time, now they are only about the power to give effects.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c05_4']	所言三因於正生者，謂未來法於正生位生現前故，名正生時。	所言三因於正生者，謂未來法於正生位生現前故，名正生時。	011	The so-called three causes at the time of arising refer to future dharmas. At the stage of arising, arising is present, so it is called at the time of arising.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c06_8']	同類、遍行、異熟三種法，正生位而作功能，故有說言：	同類、遍行、異熟三種法，正生位而作功能，故有說言：	011	The three kinds of dharmas, similar, universal, and retributive, perform their functions in the present, and for this reason it is said that
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c07_2']	等流、異熟二果，因力牽引令生。	等流、異熟二果，因力牽引令生。	011	the two kinds of results, similar and retributive, are attracted by the power of the cause and are caused to arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c08_9']	同類、遍行容有無間等流果起，可言彼果於正生時因興作用。	同類、遍行容有無間等流果起，可言彼果於正生時因興作用。	011	Similar and universal results may arise without an interval, and it can be said that when the result is in the present, the cause performs its function.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c09_17']	異熟因果必隔遠時，其因久滅果方正起，如何作用在果生時？	異熟因果必隔遠時，其因久滅果方正起，如何作用在果生時？	011	The cause and result of retribution are separated by a long period of time. The cause has long since perished and the result is just now arising. How can the function exist when the result is born?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c11_6']	非過去時可有作用，此言作用意顯功能，二相別中已曾思擇。	非過去時可有作用，此言作用意顯功能，二相別中已曾思擇。	011	It is not possible for the past to have a function. The word “function” here indicates power, and the difference between the two has already been discussed in the chapter on the two characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c12_10']	其因雖滅經無量時，而有功能令自果起，由不共故。	其因雖滅經無量時，而有功能令自果起，由不共故。	011	Even though the cause has perished and a long time has passed, it has the power to cause its result to arise, because it is unique.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c14_14']	自果生時作用雖無，而於自果與功能上立作用名，唯取果功能乃名真作用，餘名作用皆是假說。	自果生時作用雖無，而於自果與功能上立作用名，唯取果功能乃名真作用，餘名作用皆是假說。	011	Even though the function does not exist when the result is born, it is given the name function in regard to the power of the result. Only the power of the result is the true function, and the rest are called functions only figuratively.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c15_13']	已說因緣二時作用，二緣作用與此相違。	已說因緣二時作用，二緣作用與此相違。	011	The two conditions of cause and condition as direct antecedent have been discussed above in terms of their functions at two times. The two conditions of homogeneous immediately antecedent and condition as object have functions that are the opposite of these.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c17_2']	等無間緣於法生位而興作用，以彼生時前心心所引開避故。	等無間緣於法生位而興作用，以彼生時前心心所引開避故。	011	The condition as direct antecedent functions at the time a dharma is born, because when it is born, the prior mind and mental activities are attracted and opened up.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c19_13']	若所緣緣能緣滅位而興作用，以心心所要現在時方取境故，其增上緣法生滅位皆無障住，故彼作用一切無遮。	若所緣緣能緣滅位而興作用，以心心所要現在時方取境故，其增上緣法生滅位皆無障住，故彼作用一切無遮。	011	The condition as object functions at the time the condition is destroyed, because mind and mental activities must take objects in the present. The dominant condition is unobstructed as to the time of the arising and cessation of dharmas, and therefore its function is not restricted to any one time.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c21_7']	今應思擇，俱有、相應及所緣緣，若法生已方興作用，何須立此二因一緣？	今應思擇，俱有、相應及所緣緣，若法生已方興作用，何須立此二因一緣？	011	Now we must consider the following question: If the two conditions of coexistent and associated, and the condition as object function after the dharma is born, why establish these two causes and one condition?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c22_15']	若執因緣要有作用方許立為因緣性者，則未來世應無因緣。	若執因緣要有作用方許立為因緣性者，則未來世應無因緣。	011	If it is held that a cause must have a function in order to be established as a cause condition, then in the future world there would be no cause conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c23_6']	然宗所許，不應為難。	然宗所許，不應為難。	011	However, this is not a problem for our school, which maintains that cause conditions exist in the future.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c23_16']	若爾，云何說有作用？	若爾，云何說有作用？	011	If this is so, why is it said that they have a function?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c25_3']	若離如是二因一緣，正滅位中所引諸法，應無作用取境功能。	若離如是二因一緣，正滅位中所引諸法，應無作用取境功能。	011	If the present state of cessation were to lack these two causes and one condition, then the dharmas that are being attracted into cessation would lack the function of grasping an object.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c26_10']	若作用無亦名緣者，諸阿羅漢最後心等亦應可立等無間緣。	若作用無亦名緣者，諸阿羅漢最後心等亦應可立等無間緣。	011	If the function of grasping an object is absent and it is still called a condition, then the final mind of an arhat would also be able to be established as an immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c27_2']	此責非理，前已辯故。	此責非理，前已辯故。	011	This criticism is unreasonable, because it has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0824c28_9']	說所緣緣非要由有作用方立，何相關涉而將例彼等無間緣？	說所緣緣非要由有作用方立，何相關涉而將例彼等無間緣？	011	It has been explained that the object-condition is not necessarily established by the presence of a function. What is the connection that would lead one to cite the immediately antecedent condition as an example?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a01_17']	彼緣要由開避牽引，故唯現在正可安立，於未來世定無彼緣，於現在時曾有作用，故雖過去亦可安立。	彼緣要由開避牽引，故唯現在正可安立，於未來世定無彼緣，於現在時曾有作用，故雖過去亦可安立。	011	That condition is necessarily established by the opening up and attraction of the mind, and therefore it is only in the present that it can be properly established. In the future, that condition definitely does not exist. Since it has had a function in the present, it can also be established in the past.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a03_6']	其所緣緣非唯現在，但有體性皆可成緣，不必要由作用而立。	其所緣緣非唯現在，但有體性皆可成緣，不必要由作用而立。	011	The object-condition is not only in the present. As long as it has a nature that exists, it can all be established as a condition. It is not necessarily established by the presence of a function.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a04_6']	唯於少分少分成緣得作用名，非於一切。	唯於少分少分成緣得作用名，非於一切。	011	Only in a small part and in a small way is the function of a condition obtained, not in all cases.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a04_16']	云何知有體方得成緣？	云何知有體方得成緣？	011	How do we know that only when it has a nature that exists can it be established as a condition?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a05_7']	所緣體若無，覺不生故。	所緣體若無，覺不生故。	011	Because if the substance of the object does not exist, consciousness does not arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a06_5']	若所緣緣要有作用，後法無為應有前果。	若所緣緣要有作用，後法無為應有前果。	011	If the condition as object has a function, then the subsequent unconditioned dharma should have a prior effect.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a08_3']	或此作用非據親生諸果而立，但據諸法起用所憑說為作用，故後無為無前果失。	或此作用非據親生諸果而立，但據諸法起用所憑說為作用，故後無為無前果失。	011	Or, this function is not established on the basis of directly producing effects, but rather is said to be the function on which dharmas rely in arising. Therefore, subsequent unconditioned dharmas have no prior effect.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a08_12']	應言何法由幾緣生？	應言何法由幾緣生？	011	What dharmas are produced by how many conditions?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a08_15']	頌曰：	頌曰：	011	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a09_0']	心心所由四，　　二定但由三，	心心所由四，　　二定但由三，	011	Mind and mental factors arise from four, the two meditative absorptions arise from only three,
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a10_13']	餘由二緣生，　　非天次等故。	餘由二緣生，　　非天次等故。	011	The remaining dharmas arise from two conditions, not from the next moment, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a11_2']	論曰：	論曰：	011	Commentary:
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a12_2']	此中由言為顯故義，謂心心所四緣故生。	此中由言為顯故義，謂心心所四緣故生。	011	Here, the word by is used to indicate the meaning of cause. Mind and mental factors arise from four conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a14_5']	其所緣緣，除生心等無別有用，謂六識身及相應法，隨其所應以色等五及一切法為所緣緣。	其所緣緣，除生心等無別有用，謂六識身及相應法，隨其所應以色等五及一切法為所緣緣。	011	As for the condition as object, except for producing mind, etc., it has no separate function. The six consciousnesses and their associated dharmas, according to their respective cases, take the five such as form and all dharmas as the condition as object.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a15_13']	心等因緣具五因性，前生自類開避引發，是謂心等等無間緣。	心等因緣具五因性，前生自類開避引發，是謂心等等無間緣。	011	The five causes are complete in the conditions of mind, etc. The preceding homogeneous class makes way for and induces the subsequent homogeneous class. This is called the condition as direct antecedent of mind, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a16_13']	此增上緣，即一切法各除自性，隨其所應。	此增上緣，即一切法各除自性，隨其所應。	011	This dominant condition is all dharmas, each excluding its own nature, according to its own case.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a17_3']	豈不一緣二因作用？	豈不一緣二因作用？	011	Isn’t the function of the one condition and the two causes?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a17_12']	非於彼法生時即有。	非於彼法生時即有。	011	It is not that at the time of the arising of those dharmas they exist.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a18_2']	如何心等四緣故生？	如何心等四緣故生？	011	How is it that mind, etc., arise from the four conditions?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a18_11']	如何因緣具五因性？	如何因緣具五因性？	011	How is it that the condition as cause has the nature of the five causes?
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a20_18']	雖法滅位作用方成，而法生時非無功力，離此彼法必不生故，以心心所必仗所緣及託二因方得生故。	雖法滅位作用方成，而法生時非無功力，離此彼法必不生故，以心心所必仗所緣及託二因方得生故。	011	Even though the function of a dharma is established only at the time of its cessation, still it is not without efficacy at the time of its arising, because that dharma definitely will not arise apart from this efficacy. This is because mind and its activities necessarily depend on their objects and the two causes in order to be born.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a22_1']	若法與彼法為所緣，或因無暫時，非本論說故。	若法與彼法為所緣，或因無暫時，非本論說故。	011	If a dharma is the condition as object for another dharma, or is a cause for it, it is never for a short time. This is not the case in the Abhidharma.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a23_1']	二無心定三緣故生，除所緣緣，非能緣故。	二無心定三緣故生，除所緣緣，非能緣故。	011	The two mindless samādhis arise from three conditions, excluding the condition as object, because they do not grasp objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a23_10']	此因緣者但有二因：	此因緣者但有二因：	011	The condition as cause in this case is only two causes:
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a24_5']	一俱有因，謂二定上生等諸相；	一俱有因，謂二定上生等諸相；	011	the first is the simultaneous cause, that is, the characteristics of birth, etc., in the two samādhis;
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a24_19']	二同類因，謂前已生自地善法。	二同類因，謂前已生自地善法。	011	Second is similar cause, that is, previously arisen good dharmas of the same stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a25_13']	等無間緣，謂入定心及相應法。	等無間緣，謂入定心及相應法。	011	The condition as direct antecedent is the mind and mental factors that enter samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a26_3']	增上緣者，謂如前說。	增上緣者，謂如前說。	011	The dominant condition is as explained above.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a27_12']	豈不無想亦三緣生，是心心所等無間故，亦應說為心等無間。	豈不無想亦三緣生，是心心所等無間故，亦應說為心等無間。	011	Isn't the attainment of non-perception also born from three conditions? Because it is the condition as direct antecedent of mind and mental factors, it should also be said to be the condition as direct antecedent of mind, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_011:0825a28_11']	但非心等加行引生，故於此中廢而不說。	但非心等加行引生，故於此中廢而不說。	011	But because it is not produced by the exertion of mind, etc., it is omitted here and not mentioned.
