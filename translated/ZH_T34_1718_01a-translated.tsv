If the seeds are not planted, then the sprouts do not grow, then the foul-smelling fluids do not flow out, then the maggots do not appear. Therefore, it is called non-arising.

Thinking of the five desires is giving rise to the sprouts of suffering. The six sense faculties grasping the six sense objects is called the flowing out of foul-smelling fluids. The competition between good and evil within the six sense objects is called maggots. If one knows that eyes and forms are impermanent, suffering, empty, and without self, then greed and anger do not arise, thoughts of desire do not arise, grasping of objects does not arise, and good and evil actions do not arise. This is non-arising.

The image is not born from the mirror, not born from the face, not born from the combination of mirror and face, not born apart from mirror and face. Since it is not born from the four propositions, it is neither inside, outside, nor in between. It is not eternally existent and has no place of cessation. When it goes, it does not reach the four directions of east, west, south, and north. Its nature is originally unborn, not ceasing, not ceasing and not non-ceasing. Its nature is originally unceasing, not ceasing, not ceasing and not non-ceasing. Because of non-arising and non-ceasing, it is called non-arising.

An illusion does not arise from illusory objects, nor does it arise from the illusionist, nor does it arise from the combination of objects and the illusionist, nor does it arise apart from objects and the illusionist. Searching for the arising of an illusion in the four propositions, arising has no origin. Searching for the cessation of an illusion in the four directions, cessation has no destination. Since its nature is originally unborn, it is not extinguished. Since non-arising is unborn, its nature is originally unceasing. Since non-cessation is unceasing, non-arising and non-cessation are called unborn.

From the very beginning, each is not real. They arise due to false thoughts. The power of karma and mechanisms falsely form an empty aggregation. The essence of ignorance has never existed by itself. It exists due to the combination of false thoughts and conditions. Existence has never existed by itself. Conditions form all afflictions, karma, and suffering like a whirling fire wheel. Contemplate their original non-existence, all as explained above. This is the general meaning and so forth.
