['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a20_11']	今此品者，亦為遮空所對治，以鞞世師等於前品中立時不成故說。	今此品者，亦為遮空所對治，以鞞世師等於前品中立時不成故說。	This chapter is also to refute the opposite of emptiness, because the Vaiśeṣikas and others in the previous chapter established time as not being established, therefore it is said.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a21_4']	鞞婆沙人及僧佉人等言：	鞞婆沙人及僧佉人等言：	The Vaiśeṣikas and Sāṃkhyas and others say:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a21_19']	第一義中有如是時，果有生滅故。	第一義中有如是時，果有生滅故。	In the ultimate truth, there is such time, because the arising and ceasing of effects exist.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a23_1']	如種子與水土和合，以時節有體故而芽得生。	如種子與水土和合，以時節有體故而芽得生。	Just as a seed combines with water and soil, because time has a substance, sprouts can be born.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a23_11']	若無因者，果則不生。	若無因者，果則不生。	If there is no cause, the effect will not arise.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a24_8']	以是故如前所說，因有力故，當知有時。	以是故如前所說，因有力故，當知有時。	For this reason, as previously stated, because the cause has power, one should know that there is time.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a24_12']	論者言：	論者言：	The Proponent of the Treatise says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a25_10']	若有說言因緣和合有果生者，今當答之。	若有說言因緣和合有果生者，今當答之。	If someone says that effects arise from the combination of causes and conditions, now I will answer.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a25_15']	如論偈說：	如論偈說：	As the treatise verse says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a26_14']	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合而果生；	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合而果生；	If you say the effect arises from the combination of causes and conditions,
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a27_13']	是果先已有，　　何須和合生？	是果先已有，　　何須和合生？	then the effect must already exist, so why is it necessary for it to arise from the combination?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a28_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The explanation is:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a28_15']	和合中若有果者，得如是過。	和合中若有果者，得如是過。	If there is an effect within the combination, then this fault is incurred.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a28_19']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a29_3']	有不生故。	有不生故。	Because there is no arising.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111a29_18']	若有而從和合中生者，有云何生？	若有而從和合中生者，有云何生？	If there is something that arises from the combination, what does existence arise from?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b01_9']	若言生者，和合中則無。	若言生者，和合中則無。	If it is said to arise, then there is no existence within the combination.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b01_13']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b02_2']	有之與生二法相違。	有之與生二法相違。	Because existence and arising are two mutually contradictory dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b02_15']	復次若有果則不生，已有故。	復次若有果則不生，已有故。	Furthermore, if there is an effect, it does not arise, because it already exists.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b03_4']	果若已有不須更生。	果若已有不須更生。	If the effect already exists, it does not need to arise again.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b03_8']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b03_17']	生與不生此二相違。	生與不生此二相違。	Because arising and non-arising are two mutually contradictory things.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b05_1']	若有言因緣和合中無果而能生果者，今當答之。	若有言因緣和合中無果而能生果者，今當答之。	If someone says that there is no effect within the combination of causes and conditions, but it can give rise to an effect, we will now respond to this.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b05_6']	如論偈說：	如論偈說：	As the treatise verse says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b06_14']	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合而果生；	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合而果生；	If you say the effect arises from the combination of causes and conditions,🔽then the effect must already exist, so why is it necessary for it to arise from the combination?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b07_13']	和合中無果，　　何須和合生？	和合中無果，　　何須和合生？	Within the combination, there is no effect. Why is it necessary for the combination to produce?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b08_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The explanation is:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b08_18']	此謂果不生，無有生故，譬如兔角。	此謂果不生，無有生故，譬如兔角。	This means that the effect does not arise because there is no arising, like the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b09_14']	若無生者，生法體壞，是汝立義等過。	若無生者，生法體壞，是汝立義等過。	If there is no arising, the essence of the arising dharma is destroyed. This is the fault of your established thesis, etc.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b10_10']	若立因緣和合中有果者，今當重破。	若立因緣和合中有果者，今當重破。	If you establish that within the combination of causes and conditions there is an effect, now it should be refuted again.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b10_15']	如論偈說：	如論偈說：	As the treatise verse says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b11_0']	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合而有果，	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合而有果，	If it is said that within the combination of causes and conditions there is an effect,
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b12_13']	是果應可取，　　而實不可取。	是果應可取，　　而實不可取。	Then that effect should be graspable, but in reality it is ungraspable.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b13_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The explanation is:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b13_9']	此謂果不可取。	此謂果不可取。	This means that the effect is ungraspable.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b13_13']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b14_7']	一心欲取而不能取，以果無故。	一心欲取而不能取，以果無故。	Because the mind desires to grasp but cannot grasp it, due to the non-existence of the effect.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b15_4']	此下作驗，和合中有芽名果亦不可取。	此下作驗，和合中有芽名果亦不可取。	Below this, a logical argument is made that the sprout within the combination is also ungraspable.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b15_8']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b15_19']	和合中無果，故不可取。	和合中無果，故不可取。	Because there is no effect within the combination, it is ungraspable.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b16_18']	若不可取者，是中則無，譬如種中無有瓶絹。	若不可取者，是中則無，譬如種中無有瓶絹。	If it is ungraspable, then it does not exist within it, like a pot or silk does not exist within a seed.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b17_14']	如是於和合中無芽名果，故不可取。	如是於和合中無芽名果，故不可取。	In this way, there is no name of sprout in the combination, so it cannot be grasped.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b17_19']	僧佉人言：	僧佉人言：	The Sāṃkhya person says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b20_3']	彼說和合中不可取者，亦有是義，所謂極遠極近及諸根損患、心迷悶時、有隔障等，能障於取。	彼說和合中不可取者，亦有是義，所謂極遠極近及諸根損患、心迷悶時、有隔障等，能障於取。	As for what you said about not being able to grasp in the combination, there is also this meaning, namely, being too far away, too close, having damaged faculties, the mind being confused, having obstructions, etc., which can obstruct grasping.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b21_2']	雖有物體而不可取，非一向無故不可取。	雖有物體而不可取，非一向無故不可取。	Although there is an entity, it cannot be grasped, not because it is completely non-existent, but because it cannot be grasped.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b21_16']	若言無者，是彼出因立義之過。	若言無者，是彼出因立義之過。	If you say it does not exist, this is a fault in the reason and thesis that they put forth.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b22_6']	復次更有異僧佉人言：	復次更有異僧佉人言：	Next, there is another Sāṃkhya person who says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b22_18']	如前所說過者，今當更說。	如前所說過者，今當更說。	As for the faults mentioned above, I will now explain further.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b23_15']	彼上出因言不可取者，此因有何等義？	彼上出因言不可取者，此因有何等義？	As for the reason they put forth above, saying it cannot be grasped, what is the meaning of this reason?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b24_5']	為是現量不可取耶？	為是現量不可取耶？	Is it that it cannot be grasped by direct perception?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b25_4']	如諸根識而實是有，亦不為現量所取故。	如諸根識而實是有，亦不為現量所取故。	Just as the faculties and consciousnesses actually exist, but are not grasped by direct perception.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b25_14']	彼立因者，非是一向。	彼立因者，非是一向。	The reason they put forth is not one-sided.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b27_1']	若以驗量不可取者，因義不成，猶如驗因中果有取可量故。	若以驗量不可取者，因義不成，猶如驗因中果有取可量故。	If it is said that the result cannot be grasped through inference, then the reason is not established, because in the case of inferring a result, there is something graspable that can be measured.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111b27_17']	若可量者，因則不空，譬如有果體。	若可量者，因則不空，譬如有果體。	If it can be measured, then the reason is not empty, like the existence of a result.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c01_7']	如是苦樂二種能為貪瞋諸見三煩惱因，色聲五種亦能為貪瞋等三煩惱因，以是因等有驗量故，因中果有取。	如是苦樂二種能為貪瞋諸見三煩惱因，色聲五種亦能為貪瞋等三煩惱因，以是因等有驗量故，因中果有取。	In the same way, both suffering and pleasure can be the causes of the three afflictions of greed, anger, and various views. The five sense objects of form, sound, etc. can also be the causes of the three afflictions of greed, anger, etc. Because there is something graspable through inference and measurement, the result exists in the cause.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c02_12']	汝雖言現量不可取，然今驗量有可取故，彼出因義不成。	汝雖言現量不可取，然今驗量有可取故，彼出因義不成。	Although you say that direct perception cannot grasp, since there is something graspable through inference and measurement now, the reason you give is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c03_15']	若現量及驗量俱不可取者，此違我義及因不成。	若現量及驗量俱不可取者，此違我義及因不成。	If both direct perception and inference are ungraspable, then this contradicts my view and the reason is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c03_19']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c05_4']	我道不可取者，謂於因緣和合中畢竟無果故不可取。	我道不可取者，謂於因緣和合中畢竟無果故不可取。	What I say is ungraspable means that ultimately there is no result in the combination of causes and conditions, so it cannot be grasped.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c06_17']	汝言極遠等亦不可取，非一向無者，世諦之中亦無此理，何況第一義耶。	汝言極遠等亦不可取，非一向無者，世諦之中亦無此理，何況第一義耶。	You say that extremely distant things and so forth can also not be grasped, but not that they are completely non-existent. Even in the conventional truth, this principle does not exist, let alone in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c08_13']	於第一義中亦無極遠等物，如上苦樂色聲等於第一義中亦無，是則因義不成。	於第一義中亦無極遠等物，如上苦樂色聲等於第一義中亦無，是則因義不成。	In the ultimate truth, there are also no extremely distant things and so forth, just as above, pleasure and pain, form, sound and so forth do not exist in the ultimate truth. This then means that the reason is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c09_6']	所言果者，果亦自體空故。	所言果者，果亦自體空故。	As for the so-called effect, the effect is also empty of its own nature.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c10_17']	若因中無果者，世諦中果亦不生，譬如拒不能生拒，因亦不能生因。	若因中無果者，世諦中果亦不生，譬如拒不能生拒，因亦不能生因。	If there is no effect within the cause, then in the conventional truth, the effect also does not arise. For example, a non-cause cannot produce a non-cause, and a cause also cannot produce a cause.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c11_15']	汝言因能生果者，於世諦中亦已被破。	汝言因能生果者，於世諦中亦已被破。	You say that the cause can produce the effect, but even in the conventional truth, this has already been refuted.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c12_4']	復有異僧佉人言：	復有異僧佉人言：	Furthermore, a certain Saṃkhya person says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c13_4']	若因未生時先無因體，果亦先無而後方生。	若因未生時先無因體，果亦先無而後方生。	If the cause has not yet arisen, and prior to it there is no essence of the cause, then the effect also does not exist prior to it, but arises later.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c13_8']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c13_13']	今當說驗。	今當說驗。	Now a logical argument will be presented.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c14_20']	若先無因，後亦不生，無有故，譬如空華石女等，廣如前說驗。	若先無因，後亦不生，無有故，譬如空華石女等，廣如前說驗。	If there is no cause prior to it, then it will not arise later either, because it does not exist, like a sky flower, the child of a barren woman, and so forth, as extensively explained above.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c16_7']	今更總答修多羅人及鞞世師等計因中無果者，如論偈說：	今更總答修多羅人及鞞世師等計因中無果者，如論偈說：	Now, I will further answer the Sūtra master and the Vaiśeṣika and others who believe that there is no effect in the cause. As the treatise verse says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c17_14']	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合無果者；	「若謂眾因緣，　　和合無果者；	If it is said that the combination of many causes and conditions is without effect,
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c18_13']	是則眾因緣，　　與非因緣同。	是則眾因緣，　　與非因緣同。	Then the many causes and conditions would be the same as non-causes and conditions.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c19_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The commentary explains:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c19_13']	此言無果者，謂果空故。	此言無果者，謂果空故。	This statement of without effect means that the effect is empty.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c20_2']	因之與果云何差別？	因之與果云何差別？	How is there a distinction between cause and effect?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c21_6']	因相者，謂自果生、無間生、自分生等差別，是為因相。	因相者，謂自果生、無間生、自分生等差別，是為因相。	The characteristic of a cause is that it produces its own effect, produces without interval, produces its own kind, and so on. This is the characteristic of a cause.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c23_4']	緣相者，謂通生種種果，能長養他，令他相續，乃至遠處通生諸果，非自分生能廣饒益。	緣相者，謂通生種種果，能長養他，令他相續，乃至遠處通生諸果，非自分生能廣饒益。	The characteristic of a condition is that it generally produces various effects, is able to nourish others, causes others to continue, up to producing effects in distant places, produces its own kind, and is able to extensively benefit.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c23_15']	如是等名為因緣差別相。	如是等名為因緣差別相。	These are called the distinguishing characteristics of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c24_12']	與非因緣同者，謂非因緣不生於果。	與非因緣同者，謂非因緣不生於果。	The same as non-causes and conditions means that non-causes and conditions do not produce effects.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c24_16']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c24_20']	果空故。	果空故。	Because the effect is empty.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c25_10']	以是故因緣與非因緣同。	以是故因緣與非因緣同。	Therefore, causes and non-causes are the same.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c27_2']	復次今為執因中無果者出驗，第一義中種子等諸因緣不能生果。	復次今為執因中無果者出驗，第一義中種子等諸因緣不能生果。	Next, for those who hold that there is no effect in the cause, a logical argument is presented: in the ultimate truth, seed and other causes are unable to produce effects.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c27_6']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c27_16']	果空故，譬如非因緣。	果空故，譬如非因緣。	Because the effect is empty, like non-causes.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c28_3']	復次修多羅人言：	復次修多羅人言：	Next, the Sūtra master says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c28_8']	緣能生果。	緣能生果。	Conditions are able to produce effects.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c28_12']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c29_1']	有決定緣能生果故。	有決定緣能生果故。	Because there are definite conditions that can produce effects.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c29_11']	若果空者，義不相應。	若果空者，義不相應。	If the effect is empty, the meaning is not coherent.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0111c29_15']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a01_12']	第一義中無如是驗，還同上非因緣過。	第一義中無如是驗，還同上非因緣過。	In the ultimate truth, there is no such logical argument, and it falls back into the error of non-causes.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a02_4']	欲令他信解者，汝驗無力。	欲令他信解者，汝驗無力。	If one wishes to make others understand, your logical argument is powerless.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a02_11']	修多羅人復言：	修多羅人復言：	The Sūtra master further says:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a03_13']	見麥種子能生麥芽，以是故彼出因者無有義理。	見麥種子能生麥芽，以是故彼出因者無有義理。	It is seen that barley seeds can produce barley sprouts, therefore the argument you put forth is unreasonable.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a03_17']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a04_16']	世諦之中實見麥種能生麥芽，非第一義。	世諦之中實見麥種能生麥芽，非第一義。	In the conventional truth, it is indeed seen that barley seeds can produce barley sprouts, but not in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a05_13']	若於第一義中麥生芽者，是義不然。	若於第一義中麥生芽者，是義不然。	If in the ultimate truth a wheat seed produces a wheat sprout, this is not so.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a06_9']	如是觀察有果生者不然，如先答。	如是觀察有果生者不然，如先答。	Thus, observing the arising of an existent effect is not so, as previously explained.
['ZH_T30_1566_012:0112a07_8']	汝立果生滅以為因者，果有生義不然。	汝立果生滅以為因者，果有生義不然。	If you establish the arising and cessation of an effect as the cause, the meaning of the arising of an effect is not so.
