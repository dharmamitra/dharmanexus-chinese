['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a01_19']	若無我者，心等生已無間即滅，宿生念智憶昔某名即是今我，此不應有。	若無我者，心等生已無間即滅，宿生念智憶昔某名即是今我，此不應有。	If there is no self, then the mind and so forth arise and immediately cease. The wisdom that recollects past lives thinking I was named such-and-such in the past should not exist.

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a02_9']	今昔異故。	今昔異故。	Because past and present are different.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a04_2']	世間不見憶昔他身謂為今我，是故定有常住句義緣之生念，言彼即我。	世間不見憶昔他身謂為今我，是故定有常住句義緣之生念，言彼即我。	The world does not see the recollection of a past body and take it to be the present self. Therefore, there definitely exists the meaning of permanence as a basis for the arising of recollection, saying that is me.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a05_10']	此亦不然，我先已說因果雖殊相續假一，緣此假一言昔是今。	此亦不然，我先已說因果雖殊相續假一，緣此假一言昔是今。	This is also not so. I have previously said that cause and effect, although different, are provisionally regarded as one continuum. Based on this, one can provisionally say in the past it was, and now it is.

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a09_10']	若宿生念依相似相，見昔似今謂今為昔，便謂有我是一是常。	若宿生念依相似相，見昔似今謂今為昔，便謂有我是一是常。	If memory of past lives depends on similar characteristics, seeing the past as similar to the present, one takes the present as the past and then says there is a self that is one and permanent.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a10_17']	既見今身依相似相，瘡痕似昔謂昔為今，身亦應許是常是一。	既見今身依相似相，瘡痕似昔謂昔為今，身亦應許是常是一。	Since one sees the present body based on similar characteristics, with wounds and scars similar to the past, one takes the past as the present and the body should also be said to be permanent and one.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a12_15']	此顯共知有差別物，依相續假亦謂無異，故不可以謂無異相，比知有我是一是常。	此顯共知有差別物，依相續假亦謂無異，故不可以謂無異相，比知有我是一是常。	This shows that commonly known different things, based on the continuity metaphor, are also said to be without difference. Therefore, one cannot infer the existence of a self that is one and permanent based on the absence of a difference in characteristics.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a14_12']	又憶昔身苦樂等事，謂今是昔而是無常，亦應比知雖謂今昔我無有異而非常住。	又憶昔身苦樂等事，謂今是昔而是無常，亦應比知雖謂今昔我無有異而非常住。	Moreover, one remembers the events of past bodies, such as suffering and happiness, and says the present is the past and is impermanent. One should also infer that although one says the present and past self are without difference, it is not permanently abiding.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a17_10']	又雖今昔其體有異，然由昔智了受所緣，有勝功能熏在宅識，隨緣覺發念力相應，似昔所緣境界相現，如是名為憶宿生事。	又雖今昔其體有異，然由昔智了受所緣，有勝功能熏在宅識，隨緣覺發念力相應，似昔所緣境界相現，如是名為憶宿生事。	Moreover, although the substance of the present and past is different, the past cognition that understands the object of feeling has a superior function that perfumes the store consciousness, and in accordance with conditions, the power of memory corresponds with it, and the characteristics of the object as it was in the past appear. This is called remembering past lives.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a20_11']	雖無有我是一是常，而有憶念宿生事智，世間現見服仙藥等，服之經久，藥體雖無，然有所引勝功能在，後時成熟除疾益壽，然無有我。	雖無有我是一是常，而有憶念宿生事智，世間現見服仙藥等，服之經久，藥體雖無，然有所引勝功能在，後時成熟除疾益壽，然無有我。	Although there is no self that is one or permanent, there is the knowledge of remembering past lives. It is seen in the world that by taking elixirs, even though the substance of the elixir is gone after a long time, there is still a superior function that is brought about, which later ripens to remove illness and prolong life. However, there is no self.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a21_6']	此亦如是，若唯有念，誰為念者？	此亦如是，若唯有念，誰為念者？	This is also like this. If there is only memory, who is the one who remembers?
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a22_4']	亦不可言念為念者，以有二種俱無過故。	亦不可言念為念者，以有二種俱無過故。	It cannot be said that memory is the one who remembers, because there are two kinds that are both without fault.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a22_14']	設復有我，誰為念者？	設復有我，誰為念者？	Even if there is a self, who is the one who remembers?
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a23_12']	亦不可言我為念者，以所執我非智相故。	亦不可言我為念者，以所執我非智相故。	It also cannot be said that the self is the one who remembers, because the self that is grasped is not the characteristic of knowledge.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a25_10']	若言我體雖非智相，與思合故能有思念，是則此我與思合時，於自他相應有取捨。	若言我體雖非智相，與思合故能有思念，是則此我與思合時，於自他相應有取捨。	If it is said that although the essence of the self is not the characteristic of knowledge, it can have thought and memory because it combines with thought, then when this self combines with thought, there should be acceptance and rejection in relation to self and others.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a25_19']	若有取捨便是無常；	若有取捨便是無常；	If there is acceptance and rejection, then it is impermanent;
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a26_17']	若無取捨不異前故，與思合時亦無思念。	若無取捨不異前故，與思合時亦無思念。	if there is no acceptance and rejection, it is no different from before, so when combining with thought, there is also no thought.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198a27_7']	是則此我亦非念者。	是則此我亦非念者。	Then this self would also not be the thinker.

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b03_2']	若所執我本性非思，與思合故轉成思念，如頗胝迦體非青等，青等合故變成青等。	若所執我本性非思，與思合故轉成思念，如頗胝迦體非青等，青等合故變成青等。	If the self grasped as having a nature that is not thought, because combined with thought, transforms into thought, then it would be like crystal, whose nature is not blue, etc., but becomes blue, etc., because combined with blue, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b04_1']	是則此思與非思我而共合故，應成非思。	是則此思與非思我而共合故，應成非思。	Then this thought, because combined with a self that is not thought, should become not thought.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b04_19']	若思雖與非思我合，不捨本性不成非思。	若思雖與非思我合，不捨本性不成非思。	If thought, although combined with a self that is not thought, does not abandon its original nature and does not become not thought,

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b07_6']	頗胝迦寶青等合時，舉體別生故見異色，非即本性變成餘相。	頗胝迦寶青等合時，舉體別生故見異色，非即本性變成餘相。	When crystal is combined with blue, etc., it produces a completely different color, so it is seen as a different color. It is not that its original nature transforms into another appearance.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b09_4']	以頗胝迦其體清潤，餘色合故舉體別生，形相同前謂為本質，實非本性變成餘色。	以頗胝迦其體清潤，餘色合故舉體別生，形相同前謂為本質，實非本性變成餘色。	Because the substance of crystal is clear and moist, and when other colors are combined, the entire substance produces a new color. The shape is the same as before, which is called the original substance, but it is not really the original nature that transforms into another color.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b10_3']	又頗胝迦前後異體，相差別故，如青黃等。	又頗胝迦前後異體，相差別故，如青黃等。	Moreover, the substance of crystal is different before and after, and the characteristics are different, just like blue, yellow, etc.

When other colors are combined, they reside in separate places, do not abandon their original characteristics, and do not take on other characteristics.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b14_7']	若有作意或不作意，還見本相及近彼色。	若有作意或不作意，還見本相及近彼色。	Whether there is intention or not, one still sees the original characteristics and the color near it.

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b16_14']	頗胝迦寶其性明徹猶如明鏡，餘色合時影現其內，見者目亂謂成餘色，而實此寶不變如前。	頗胝迦寶其性明徹猶如明鏡，餘色合時影現其內，見者目亂謂成餘色，而實此寶不變如前。	The nature of crystal is clear and penetrating, just like a bright mirror. When other colors are combined, reflections appear within it. The viewer is confused and considers it to become another color, but in reality this crystal does not change like before.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b17_4']	此皆非理，違比量故。	此皆非理，違比量故。	All of these are unreasonable, because they contradict inference.

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b19_11']	又所執我思生前後，其相有無不決定故，則應同思念念生滅。	又所執我思生前後，其相有無不決定故，則應同思念念生滅。	Moreover, the self that you posit has the thought of arising before and after, and its characteristics are uncertain as to existence or nonexistence, so it would be the same as thought, arising and ceasing moment by moment.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b20_10']	又我思合轉成思者，與苦樂合應成苦樂。	又我思合轉成思者，與苦樂合應成苦樂。	Moreover, if the self transforms into thought through the combination of thought, it should become painful or pleasurable when combined with pain or pleasure.
['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198b21_18']	若不爾者，雖苦樂合不捨前位，猶如虛空雨火無變，應非受者。	若不爾者，雖苦樂合不捨前位，猶如虛空雨火無變，應非受者。	If it is not so, then even though combined with pain and pleasure, it does not abandon its previous state, just as space is unchanged by rain or fire, and it should not be a subject of experience.

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0198c02_5']	即念自性似所念境，相狀生時雖無主宰，似有作用假名念者，記別分明說名為念。	即念自性似所念境，相狀生時雖無主宰，似有作用假名念者，記別分明說名為念。	The nature of memory is similar to the remembered object. Although there is no master or controller when the appearance arises, it is provisionally called memory based on the apparent activity. It is called memory because it clearly distinguishes and remembers.

The other parts of the self are not united with the mind, do not generate thought, and are therefore not called the thinker. The mind has resistance and is subtle, like the most subtle atoms. The nature of the self is empty and pervasive, vast like the realm of space. A small part of the mind is united and can generate thought, but the other parts, which are boundless, do not have thought. Therefore, you should consider the many parts to be the characteristics of the self, and should not consider the few parts to be the thinker.

The self has none of these two things, and therefore I should not be called the thinker.

['ZH_T30_1571_003:0200a16_14']	若不別顯我之自相，終不能立我有實體，自相畢竟不可說故，汝所立我則為無我。	若不別顯我之自相，終不能立我有實體，自相畢竟不可說故，汝所立我則為無我。	If you do not reveal the specific characteristics of the self, you will never be able to establish that the self has a real substance, because its specific characteristics are ultimately indescribable. The self you establish is then non-self.
