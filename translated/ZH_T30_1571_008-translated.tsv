['ZH_T30_1571_008:0229c29_8']	6 破邊執品破邊執品第六如是已辨根境皆虛，復為滌除非真句義邊執垢穢，故說頌曰：	6 破邊執品破邊執品第六如是已辨根境皆虛，復為滌除非真句義邊執垢穢，故說頌曰：	Chapter 6: Refuting Extreme Attachments, Refuting Extreme Attachments. Thus, the sense faculties and objects have all been shown to be false. In order to further wash away the defilements of extreme attachments to non-true sentence meanings, a verse is spoken:
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a01_14']	「諸法若實有，　　應不依他成；	「諸法若實有，　　應不依他成；	If dharmas really exist, they should not be established in dependence on others;
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a02_13']	既必依他成，　　定知非實有。	既必依他成，　　定知非實有。	Since they must be established in dependence on others, one should know they definitely do not really exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a03_2']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a04_1']	若一切法性相實有，應不依他而得成立。	若一切法性相實有，應不依他而得成立。	If the nature and characteristics of all dharmas really exist, they should not be established in dependence on others.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a04_19', 'ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a05_17']	既色等法必依他成，如此彼岸定非實有。🔽鵂鶹所執實等句義，有等為因而得顯了；	既色等法必依他成，如此彼岸定非實有。 鵂鶹所執實等句義，有等為因而得顯了；	Since form and other dharmas must be established in dependence on others, this and the other shore definitely do not really exist.🔽The sentence meaning of real and so forth grasped by the owl must be manifested by causes such as existence;
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a06_16']	有等句義復因實等，為自所依方可了別。	有等句義復因實等，為自所依方可了別。	The sentence meaning of existence and so forth again depend on real and so forth as their own basis in order to be cognized.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a08_14']	又色等法待自因緣及光明等而得顯現，不見少法自體為依，故色等塵皆非實有。	又色等法待自因緣及光明等而得顯現，不見少法自體為依，故色等塵皆非實有。	Moreover, form and so forth are manifested in dependence on their own causes and conditions and on light and so forth. We do not see that the substance of form and so forth is independent. Therefore form and so forth do not really exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a10_3']	若言相待雖立別名，而此彼岸其體實有，即色等故，同喻不成。	若言相待雖立別名，而此彼岸其體實有，即色等故，同喻不成。	If you say that although the names of this shore and the other shore are established in dependence on each other, the substance of this shore and the other shore really exist, because they are form and so forth, the example is not established.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a10_8']	此說不然。	此說不然。	This statement is not correct.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a12_6']	色等相待體相無異，此彼兩岸相待有殊，故此彼岸非即色等，其體非實，同喻得成。	色等相待體相無異，此彼兩岸相待有殊，故此彼岸非即色等，其體非實，同喻得成。	The substance of form and so forth is not different in dependence on each other, but this shore and the other shore are different in dependence on each other. Therefore this shore and the other shore are not form and so forth. Their substance is not real, and the example is established.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a14_3']	又彼所宗實等句義，若無因立應似空花，若有因成應同幻事，故不可執其體實有。	又彼所宗實等句義，若無因立應似空花，若有因成應同幻事，故不可執其體實有。	Moreover, the meanings of the categories such as substance that are accepted by the other party are like empty flowers if they are established without a cause. If they are established with a cause, they are like illusions. Therefore you cannot accept that their substance really exists.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a15_11']	數論宗中色等諸法，不離樂等依樂等成，樂等亦應依他而立。	數論宗中色等諸法，不離樂等依樂等成，樂等亦應依他而立。	In the Sāṃkhya school, form and so forth are not separate from pleasure and so forth and are established in dependence on pleasure and so forth. Pleasure and so forth should also be established in dependence on something else.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a16_1']	若不爾者，轉變應無。	若不爾者，轉變應無。	If this is not so, there would be no transformation.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a16_11']	有因無因，類同前說。	有因無因，類同前說。	Whether there is a cause or not, the categories are the same as those discussed previously.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a16_20']	是故色等其體非真。	是故色等其體非真。	Therefore, form and so forth are not real in substance.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a18_20']	復次諸外道宗執有瓶等，即色離色皆不得成，以必依他瓶等可了，如前同喻，其體非真。	復次諸外道宗執有瓶等，即色離色皆不得成，以必依他瓶等可了，如前同喻，其體非真。	Moreover, the non-Buddhist schools hold that there are such things as pots, but they cannot be established as either identical with or different from form, because they must depend on something else for their cognition, like the previously mentioned analogies, which are not real in substance.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a19_17']	不可說言瓶等即色瓶依色了，故不依他。	不可說言瓶等即色瓶依色了，故不依他。	One cannot say that pots and so forth are identical with form, because pots are cognized in dependence on form, and so they do not depend on something else.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a20_3']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?

['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a23_1']	非即色體可立有瓶，聲等亦成瓶自性故。	非即色體可立有瓶，聲等亦成瓶自性故。	A pot cannot be established as identical with the substance of form, because sound and so forth would also become the intrinsic nature of the pot.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a23_19']	色非聲等為其自性，如何可立色即是瓶？	色非聲等為其自性，如何可立色即是瓶？	Form is not the intrinsic nature of sound and so forth. How can it be established that form is precisely the pot?
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a24_18']	聲等亦應非即瓶體，義同色破，故不別論。	聲等亦應非即瓶體，義同色破，故不別論。	Sound and so forth should also not be the very substance of the pot, because the meaning is the same as the refutation of form. Therefore, it is not discussed separately.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a25_17']	又一一瓶多法為體，色等不爾，如何即瓶？	又一一瓶多法為體，色等不爾，如何即瓶？	Moreover, each pot has many dharmas as its substance, but form and so forth are not like this. How can it be precisely the pot?
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a27_13']	色等即瓶應如瓶一，瓶即色等應如彼多，故不可言瓶與色等體俱實有相即而成。	色等即瓶應如瓶一，瓶即色等應如彼多，故不可言瓶與色等體俱實有相即而成。	Color, etc., would be the same as the pot, and the pot would be the same as color, etc. Therefore, it cannot be said that the pot and color, etc., are both real and identical.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a28_11']	若謂色體散時，體非瓶聚即轉為瓶；	若謂色體散時，體非瓶聚即轉為瓶；	If it is said that when the substance of color is scattered, the substance is not the pot but becomes the pot,
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230a29_7']	亦應色體散時，體是色聚轉成非色。	亦應色體散時，體是色聚轉成非色。	then it should also be said that when the substance of color is scattered, the substance is color but becomes non-color.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b02_5']	若色聚時亦瓶亦色，是則一法應有二相，此前已破體應成多，是故瓶等非即色等。	若色聚時亦瓶亦色，是則一法應有二相，此前已破體應成多，是故瓶等非即色等。	If when color is aggregated it is both the pot and color, then one dharma would have two characteristics. This has already been refuted earlier. The substance would become many. Therefore, pots, etc., are not identical to color, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b02_10']	有作是說：	有作是說：	There are some who say:

['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b04_3']	瓶依有等方可了知，是假非真已如前說。	瓶依有等方可了知，是假非真已如前說。	The pot is only known in dependence on existence, etc. This is provisional, not real. It has already been explained above.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b04_12']	又不可執離色有瓶。	又不可執離色有瓶。	Moreover, one cannot grasp that there are pots apart from color.

['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b09_4']	瓶衣等物若非色等，應如空等非色等依。	瓶衣等物若非色等，應如空等非色等依。	If such things as pots and clothes are not form, etc., they should be like space, etc., and not the supports of form, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b10_3']	是則應無瓶衣等物，以不共德無故如意。	是則應無瓶衣等物，以不共德無故如意。	Then there should be no such things as pots and clothes, because they lack unique qualities, just like mind.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b11_12']	意必是無，非無常故，如先所破我虛空等，是故瓶等非離色等。	意必是無，非無常故，如先所破我虛空等，是故瓶等非離色等。	Mind must be nonexistent, because it is impermanent, as previously refuted. Self, space, etc., are also like this. Therefore, pots, etc., are not apart from form, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b12_2']	若即若離，義既不成。	若即若離，義既不成。	If they are not apart from or identical to, the meaning is not established.

['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b17_19']	此中依言或表因義，欲顯實德因果不成。	此中依言或表因義，欲顯實德因果不成。	Here, the word support may express the meaning of cause. It is intended to show that real qualities are not established as cause and effect.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b18_17']	鵂鶹子執依瓶等因有色等果，此違比量。	鵂鶹子執依瓶等因有色等果，此違比量。	The son of Kākāsyaka holds that such effects as color, etc., have as their causes such things as pots, etc., which is contrary to inference.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b20_15']	謂非色等瓶等為因，是色等聲所詮表故，取色等心所緣境故，如色性等常故無因。	謂非色等瓶等為因，是色等聲所詮表故，取色等心所緣境故，如色性等常故無因。	That is, color, etc., do not have pots, etc., as their causes, because they are signified by such terms as “color,” etc., and because they are objects perceived by the mind that grasps color, etc., just as such qualities of the self as permanence have no causes.

['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b26_18']	若言色等樂等為性，既許體同無斯過者，此亦不然，違汝自宗根境別故。	若言色等樂等為性，既許體同無斯過者，此亦不然，違汝自宗根境別故。	If you say that color, etc., are by nature pleasure, etc., and that there is no error in admitting that their substance is the same, this is also not so, because you contradict your own doctrine that the sense organs and their objects are different.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b27_17']	復大過失，樂苦癡三有性亦同，應無異故。	復大過失，樂苦癡三有性亦同，應無異故。	There is also a great error, because pleasure, suffering, and delusion would have the same nature, and there would be no difference.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230b29_11']	若言樂等非是有性，應如兔角其體都無，色等亦應同彼非有，不相離故。	若言樂等非是有性，應如兔角其體都無，色等亦應同彼非有，不相離故。	If it is said that pleasure, etc. are not of the nature of existence, they should be completely non-existent like the horns of a rabbit. Form, etc. should also be the same as that, because they are inseparable.
['ZH_T30_1571_008:0230c01_14']	如樂等三，是即一切皆非實有，故非色等為瓶等因。	如樂等三，是即一切皆非實有，故非色等為瓶等因。	Like the three of pleasure, etc., all are not really existent. Therefore, form, etc. are not the causes of vases, etc.
