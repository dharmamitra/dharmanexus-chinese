['ZH_T41_1821_025:0381b24_8']	故見四諦時皆得法證淨。	故見四諦時皆得法證淨。	Therefore, when one sees the four truths, one attains the purity of Dharma realization.
['ZH_T41_1821_025:0381b25_1']	聖所愛戒與現觀俱故。	聖所愛戒與現觀俱故。	Because the precepts loved by the sages are together with insight.

['ZH_T41_1821_025:0381b29_12']	故見三諦唯得二種。	故見三諦唯得二種。	Therefore, when one sees the three truths, one only attains two kinds.
['ZH_T41_1821_025:0381c01_3']	見道諦時具足得四。	見道諦時具足得四。	When one sees the truth of the path, one fully obtains four.
