This phenomenon is truly non-existent, yet it is seen. This is knowledge without an object.
['ZH_T32_1646_002:0254c19_15']	又汝言以三昧力故生此無相，如實有色壞為空者，若色實有而壞為空則是顛倒，又少而言無亦無顛倒。	又汝言以三昧力故生此無相，如實有色壞為空者，若色實有而壞為空則是顛倒，又少而言無亦無顛倒。	002	Moreover, you say that by the power of samādhi, this signlessness arises, and that truly existent form is destroyed and becomes empty.

If a learner has attained a pure faculty and it is in the present, even though it has already ceased in the past and has not yet arrived in the future, because it is accomplished, one cannot say it does not exist.
['ZH_T32_1646_002:0256a02_15']	又汝言聖人不應記未來者，聖智力爾，雖未有法而能玄記，如過去法雖已滅盡，念力能知。	又汝言聖人不應記未來者，聖智力爾，雖未有法而能玄記，如過去法雖已滅盡，念力能知。	002	Moreover, you say that a sage should not predict the future. The power of a sage's wisdom is such that even though a dharma has not yet arisen, he can profoundly predict it, just as past dharmas, although already extinguished, can be known through the power of recollection.
['ZH_T32_1646_002:0256a05_4']	又汝言不應念五塵者，是凡夫人癡故妄念先取定相，後雖滅盡猶生憶念，憶法應爾，非如兔角等。	又汝言不應念五塵者，是凡夫人癡故妄念先取定相，後雖滅盡猶生憶念，憶法應爾，非如兔角等。	002	Moreover, you say that one should not recollect the five sense objects. This is because ordinary people, due to delusion, falsely grasp definite characteristics in the past, and although they have already ceased, they still give rise to recollection. Recollection should be like this, not like rabbit horns and so forth.

There are two kinds of mind: one is momentary arising and ceasing, the other is successive continuation. Using the present mind to observe the successive mind, it is not yet present.

It is to prevent the causes and conditions of evil dharmas in the future, and also to give rise to the causes and conditions of good dharmas in the future.
['ZH_T32_1646_002:0256a13_12']	又汝言則無佛者，佛寂滅相，雖現於世不攝有無，況滅度耶。	又汝言則無佛者，佛寂滅相，雖現於世不攝有無，況滅度耶。	002	Moreover, you say that there would be no Buddha. The Buddha's characteristic of quiescent extinction, although manifesting in the world, does not include existence and non-existence, let alone nirvana.
