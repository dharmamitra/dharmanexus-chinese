['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c18_9']	然法身若約報上論法，應云真如出纏是法身出現；	然法身若約報上論法，應云真如出纏是法身出現；	However, if the Dharma body is discussed in terms of the reward above, it should be said that the true suchness free from entanglements is the manifestation of the Dharma body;
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c19_12']	今以出纏為報，直就體上，故云「如理常現」。	今以出纏為報，直就體上，故云「如理常現」。	Now, being free from entanglements is the reward, and it is directly based on the essence, so it is said the principle is always present.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c19_17']	餘二可知。	餘二可知。	The other two can be understood.

['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c21_8']	先會三身十身、後會品名證成前義。	先會三身十身、後會品名證成前義。	First, it harmonizes the three bodies and ten bodies, and later it harmonizes the chapter name to prove the previous meaning.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c21_13']	前中有三：	前中有三：	There are three parts in the former:
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c22_14']	初以法報相對、二真應相對、三結融三十。	初以法報相對、二真應相對、三結融三十。	First, it compares the Dharma body and the reward body, second, it compares the true and the provisional, and third, it concludes the thirty harmonizations.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c22_17']	今初。	今初。	Now, the first.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c24_11']	言「新佛舊成曾無二體」者，以報就法，如出模之像，像本舊成，故無二體。	言「新佛舊成曾無二體」者，以報就法，如出模之像，像本舊成，故無二體。	As for the new Buddha and the old accomplishment have never had two bodies, it is because the reward is based on the Dharma. It is like a mold being removed from an image. The image has been accomplished for a long time, so there are not two bodies.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c26_7']	言「新成舊佛法報似分」者，以法就報，如金成像，金像似分，以有未成像金故。	言「新成舊佛法報似分」者，以法就報，如金成像，金像似分，以有未成像金故。	As for the newly accomplished old Buddha, the Dharma and reward seem to be divided, it is because the Dharma is based on the reward. It is like gold becoming an image. The gold and the image seem to be divided, because there is gold that has not yet become an image.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c26_17']	今成像竟，似分二矣。	今成像竟，似分二矣。	Now, the image has been accomplished, and it seems to be divided into two.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c28_7']	前對是非異，此對是非一，非一即非異，故言似分，竟無二體。	前對是非異，此對是非一，非一即非異，故言似分，竟無二體。	The previous comparison is about the difference between right and wrong, and this comparison is about the non-unity of right and wrong. Non-unity is not difference, so it is said to seem to be divided, but in the end there are not two bodies.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0614c29_6']	疏「無不應時」下，第二真應相對以辯融通。	疏「無不應時」下，第二真應相對以辯融通。	The commentary below there is no time that is not appropriate is the second part, which uses the comparison of the true and provisional to discuss the harmonization.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a01_3']	法報皆真體上常用故，即真成應；	法報皆真體上常用故，即真成應；	Because both the Dharma body and the reward body are always used on the basis of the true essence, the true becomes the responsive;
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a01_14']	用不離體故，即應而真。	用不離體故，即應而真。	Because the function is not separate from the essence, the responsive is precisely the true.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a02_10']	疏「三佛圓融」下，第三結融三十。	疏「三佛圓融」下，第三結融三十。	The third, the three Buddhas are perfectly fused, concludes the fusion of the thirty.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a03_3']	謂以三佛收十佛，不出三身。	謂以三佛收十佛，不出三身。	It means that the ten Buddhas are included in the three Buddhas, which are not apart from the three bodies.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a03_18']	三身既融，十身即三，自體無礙。	三身既融，十身即三，自體無礙。	Since the three bodies are fused, the ten bodies are precisely the three, and their own essence is unobstructed.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a04_12']	「故辯應成」下，結成正義。	「故辯應成」下，結成正義。	Therefore, it is said that the responsive is accomplished, concludes the correct principle.

['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a05_13']	二經品名，即為二別。	二經品名，即為二別。	The chapter names of the two sūtras are divided into two parts.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a05_18']	先會晉經。	先會晉經。	First, reconciling the sūtra of the Jin dynasty.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a07_4']	初二句總標，以將晉經用成前義，故有「是以」之言。	初二句總標，以將晉經用成前義，故有「是以」之言。	The first two sentences are a general statement, using the sūtra of the Jin dynasty to accomplish the previous meaning, so there is the phrase therefore.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a07_17']	「雖是義加」者，梵本無故。	「雖是義加」者，梵本無故。	Although it is a doctrinal addition, because the Sanskrit version does not have it.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a08_12']	後「以應雖從緣」下，釋性起義順應現義。	後「以應雖從緣」下，釋性起義順應現義。	Later, Although the responsive is from conditions, explains the meaning of arising from nature in accordance with the meaning of manifesting in response.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a09_4']	於中總有六義，證成性起。	於中總有六義，證成性起。	In this, there are a total of six meanings, proving and establishing the arising from nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a09_15']	今初，立理即不相違門。	今初，立理即不相違門。	First, establishing the principle is the gate of non-contradiction.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a10_10']	然出現義亦名緣起，亦名性起。	然出現義亦名緣起，亦名性起。	The meaning of appearance is also called dependent origination, also called nature origination.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a12_3']	若取相說，覽緣出現故名緣起，謂由眾生業感，如來大悲而出現故。	若取相說，覽緣出現故名緣起，謂由眾生業感，如來大悲而出現故。	If taken as a characteristic, it is called dependent origination because it observes conditions and appears, meaning that due to sentient beings' karmic retribution, the Tathāgata's great compassion appears.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a12_17']	八相成道從法性生，故名性起。	八相成道從法性生，故名性起。	The eight aspects of attaining enlightenment arise from the dharma-nature, therefore it is called nature origination.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a13_12']	今以從緣無性緣起，即名性起。	今以從緣無性緣起，即名性起。	Now, because dependent origination without nature from conditions is called nature origination.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a14_8']	又淨緣起常順於性，亦名性起。	又淨緣起常順於性，亦名性起。	Moreover, pure dependent origination always accords with nature, and is also called nature origination.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a15_2']	故云「應雖從緣不違性故」。	故云「應雖從緣不違性故」。	Therefore it says: Although the response is from conditions, it does not contradict the nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a16_2']	疏「無不從此法界流故」者，第二引梁論證成。	疏「無不從此法界流故」者，第二引梁論證成。	The commentary says: Because there is nothing that does not flow from this dharma realm, the second is citing the Liang Dynasty treatise to prove it.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a16_14']	即相成門，明性成於緣故。	即相成門，明性成於緣故。	It is the gate of mutual accomplishment, clarifying that nature accomplishes conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a17_3']	此性起自有二義：	此性起自有二義：	This nature origination itself has two meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a18_4']	一從緣無性而為性起、二法性隨緣故名性起。	一從緣無性而為性起、二法性隨緣故名性起。	First, it takes the absence of nature from conditions as its nature origination, and second, the dharma-nature follows conditions and is therefore called nature origination.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a18_16']	前段即初義，今段即後義。	前段即初義，今段即後義。	The previous section is the first meaning, and this section is the latter meaning.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a19_1']	亦應云：	亦應云：	It should also be said:
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a19_10']	無不還證此法身故。	無不還證此法身故。	Because there is no one who does not realize this Dharma body.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a20_8']	此乃緣智相成，即緣成性，即是前義。	此乃緣智相成，即緣成性，即是前義。	This is the mutual accomplishment of conditioned cognition, which is the nature of conditioned accomplishment, which is the meaning above.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a21_10']	但前取無違，今取相成，是故此為相成門也。	但前取無違，今取相成，是故此為相成門也。	But the previous understanding does not contradict this, and now the mutual accomplishment is taken. Therefore, this is the gate of mutual accomplishment.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a22_15']	疏「以淨奪染性即起」者，第三明相奪門，亦是通妨。	疏「以淨奪染性即起」者，第三明相奪門，亦是通妨。	The commentary states: The pure nature subsumes the defiled nature and arises. The third clarifies the gate of mutual subsumption, which is also a general response to objections.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a22_20']	謂有問言：	謂有問言：	There is a question:
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a23_18']	性起唯淨、緣起通染，云何緣起即是性起？	性起唯淨、緣起通染，云何緣起即是性起？	The nature of arising is only pure, while conditioned arising is common to the defiled. How can conditioned arising be the same as the nature of arising?
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a24_3']	故為此通。	故為此通。	Therefore, this is a general response.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a24_9']	謂緣起有二：	謂緣起有二：	There are two kinds of conditioned arising:
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a24_15']	一染、二淨。	一染、二淨。	One is defiled, the other pure.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a25_17']	淨謂如來大悲、菩薩萬行等，染者謂眾生惑業等。	淨謂如來大悲、菩薩萬行等，染者謂眾生惑業等。	The pure refers to the great compassion of the Tathāgata, the myriad practices of bodhisattvas, etc. The defiled refers to the afflictions and karma of sentient beings, etc.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a26_14']	若以染奪淨，則屬眾生，故唯緣起。	若以染奪淨，則屬眾生，故唯緣起。	If the defiled subsumes the pure, it belongs to sentient beings, and therefore is only conditioned arising.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a27_11']	今以淨奪染，唯屬諸佛，故名性起。	今以淨奪染，唯屬諸佛，故名性起。	Now, if the pure subsumes the defiled, it only belongs to the buddhas, and is therefore called the nature of arising.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a28_17']	疏「若離於緣性叵說故」者，即第四是相即門，亦是通妨。	疏「若離於緣性叵說故」者，即第四是相即門，亦是通妨。	If apart from conditions, nature cannot be spoken of is the fourth gate, which is also a comprehensive response to objections.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a29_1']	謂有問言：	謂有問言：	There is a question:
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615a29_16']	緣起約事、性起約理、如何相即？	緣起約事、性起約理、如何相即？	How are conditioned arising in terms of phenomena and nature arising in terms of principle mutually inclusive?
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b01_1']	故為此通。	故為此通。	Therefore, this comprehensive response is given.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b01_11']	從緣無性，方顯性起。	從緣無性，方顯性起。	Only when there is no nature from conditions can nature arising be revealed.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b02_11']	又由見緣，推知性起，若離於緣，復論何性？	又由見緣，推知性起，若離於緣，復論何性？	Moreover, by seeing conditions, one can infer nature arising. If apart from conditions, what nature can be discussed?
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b03_1']	離緣有性是斷空故。	離緣有性是斷空故。	Because having a nature apart from conditions is nihilistic emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b04_5']	疏「下加性起」者，即第五段，引當經證，即以人表法門。	疏「下加性起」者，即第五段，引當經證，即以人表法門。	The following adds nature arising is the fifth section, citing the present sutra as evidence, using people to illustrate the Dharma gate.

['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b05_9']	妨云：	妨云：	The objection is:
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b06_12']	若緣即性，妄本自空，當體即性，何以不得染奪淨耶？	若緣即性，妄本自空，當體即性，何以不得染奪淨耶？	If conditions are identical to nature, delusion is originally empty, and the essence is identical to nature, why can't delusion overpower purity?
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b06_17']	故為此通。	故為此通。	Therefore, this comprehensive response is given.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b07_8']	淨緣順性，染緣違故。	淨緣順性，染緣違故。	Because pure conditions accord with nature, while defiled conditions go against it.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b08_15']	故《瓔珞》云「始起一想住於緣，順第一義諦為善，違背為惡。	故《瓔珞》云「始起一想住於緣，順第一義諦為善，違背為惡。	Therefore, the Ornament of the Sutra of Brahma's Net says: When a single thought first arises and abides in the object, in accordance with the ultimate truth it is good, and in opposition to it it is evil.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b09_17']	」疏「今以起義多含直云出現」下，第二會通今經。	」疏「今以起義多含直云出現」下，第二會通今經。	The commentary says: Now, since the arising of meaning includes many, it is simply called appearance. The second is reconciling with the present sutra.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b11_1']	則性起局性、出現即起，起含緣性，故曰多含。	則性起局性、出現即起，起含緣性，故曰多含。	Then, nature arising is limited to nature, and appearance is precisely arising. Arising includes conditioned nature, so it is said to include many.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b11_14', 'ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b12_4']	言「從性」者性起，即法身。🔽「從因」者緣起，緣起即報身。	言「從性」者性起，即法身。 「從因」者緣起，緣起即報身。	As for arising from nature, nature arising is precisely the Dharma body.🔽As for arising from causes, conditioned arising is precisely the reward body.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b12_16']	「從真從感」，即是化身。	「從真從感」，即是化身。	Arising from the true and arising from the responsive are precisely the transformation body.

['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b14_1']	謂依法報而起於化，名曰從真。	謂依法報而起於化，名曰從真。	It is said that relying on the Dharma and reward bodies to give rise to the transformation is called arising from the true.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b14_11']	從感約生，即是緣起。	從感約生，即是緣起。	Arising from the responsive is about sentient beings, and it is precisely conditioned arising.

This is the explanation of the word place in the first consciousness that transforms in the Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi-śāstra.
['ZH_T36_1736_079:0615b20_2']	論云「所言處者，謂異熟識，由共相種成熟力故，變似色等器世間相，即外大種及所造色。	論云「所言處者，謂異熟識，由共相種成熟力故，變似色等器世間相，即外大種及所造色。	The treatise says, As for the word 'place,' it means that the consciousness that ripens, by the power of the maturation of its common characteristics, transforms into the appearances of the external world such as form, etc. This is the external great elements and the form that they create.

As for not speaking of reducing the Buddha-nature, it is because among the five natures, only one and a half natures have the Buddha-nature, namely the bodhisattva nature and half of the indeterminate nature, because the indeterminate nature may be empty or existent.
