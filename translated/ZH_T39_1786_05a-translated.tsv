['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0141c21_16']	三身相好不獨在應身，報法亦通等者，如今所列。	三身相好不獨在應身，報法亦通等者，如今所列。	05a	The characteristics and marks of the three bodies are not only in the response body, the reward and Dharma are also common. As listed now,
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0141c23_12']	目齒輪網，例於上下二十八相，通能莊嚴三種身也，以身相是一，隨見成三。	目齒輪網，例於上下二十八相，通能莊嚴三種身也，以身相是一，隨見成三。	05a	The eyes, teeth, wheels, and nets are examples of the twenty-eight major and minor marks, which can all adorn the three kinds of bodies, because the physical characteristics are one, and the three are formed according to what is seen.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0141c25_17']	莊嚴父母生身者，以藏通人但言偏空，所見佛相謂由正習構造而成，相非奇特，但能少勝輪王而已。	莊嚴父母生身者，以藏通人但言偏空，所見佛相謂由正習構造而成，相非奇特，但能少勝輪王而已。	05a	As for adorning the body born of parents, those of the Tripitaka and Shared Teachings only speak of biased emptiness. They see the Buddha's physical characteristics as constructed by right and habitual practices, and consider them to be nothing special, only slightly surpassing those of a wheel-turning king.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0141c26_17']	以不知心現見從外來，取色分齊，故名生身。	以不知心現見從外來，取色分齊，故名生身。	05a	Because they do not know that the mind manifests and see it as coming from the outside, they grasp at its physical boundaries, thus calling it a body born of parents.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0141c27_17']	此乃如來曲順凡小，示現此身，故名為應。	此乃如來曲順凡小，示現此身，故名為應。	05a	This is the Tathāgata's skillful means in accordance with the ordinary and the small, manifesting this body, thus called the responsive.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a03_17']	莊嚴尊特身者，以別教人能信中道妙色妙心隨緣變造，所見佛相知從心現，無有分齊，或現大身十蓮華藏世界塵相、或現八萬四千相好、或時秖於丈六三十二相，令其機緣無分齊見，不同藏通分齊之身，故名尊特。	莊嚴尊特身者，以別教人能信中道妙色妙心隨緣變造，所見佛相知從心現，無有分齊，或現大身十蓮華藏世界塵相、或現八萬四千相好、或時秖於丈六三十二相，令其機緣無分齊見，不同藏通分齊之身，故名尊特。	05a	As for adorning the majestic and unique body, those of the Distinct Teaching are able to believe in the wondrous color and wondrous mind of the Middle Way, which transforms according to conditions. They see the Buddha's physical characteristics as arising from the mind, without any boundaries. Sometimes he manifests a huge body with the dust-like characteristics of ten lotus treasury worlds, sometimes he manifests eighty-four thousand major and minor marks, and sometimes he only manifests in a body of six feet with thirty-two marks, causing those with the right conditions to see without boundaries, unlike the bodies with boundaries of the Tripitaka and Shared Teachings, thus called majestic and unique.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a04_11']	此乃如來修道所得，故名為報。	此乃如來修道所得，故名為報。	05a	This is what the Tathāgata attains through cultivating the path, thus called the reward.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a07_14']	莊嚴法門者，以圓教人了大小身及多少相，皆性本具、修德無功，相雖是色、色即是心，故《起信論》云「色性即智說名智身，智性即色說名法身。	莊嚴法門者，以圓教人了大小身及多少相，皆性本具、修德無功，相雖是色、色即是心，故《起信論》云「色性即智說名智身，智性即色說名法身。	05a	As for the adornment of the Dharma gate, the person of the perfect teaching understands that the large and small bodies and the many and few characteristics are all originally possessed by the nature, and there is no effort in cultivating virtue. Although the characteristics are form, form is precisely mind. Therefore, the Awakening of Faith says, The nature of form is precisely wisdom, which is called the body of wisdom. The nature of wisdom is precisely form, which is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a09_3']	」今從即智名法門故，以八萬四千陀羅尼為髮，乃至定慧為足。	」今從即智名法門故，以八萬四千陀羅尼為髮，乃至定慧為足。	05a	Now, because of being precisely wisdom, it is called the Dharma gate. Therefore, the eighty-four thousand dhāraṇīs are taken as hair, and up to samādhi and prajñā are taken as feet.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a09_17']	以即色故，故得名為法身相好。	以即色故，故得名為法身相好。	05a	Because of being precisely form, it is able to be called the characteristics and marks of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a10_15']	此乃相好隨解而轉，故使莊嚴三身相異。	此乃相好隨解而轉，故使莊嚴三身相異。	05a	This is precisely the characteristics and marks that turn according to understanding, causing the adornments of the three bodies to be different.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a11_6']	二、「此中」下，別示法門。	二、「此中」下，別示法門。	05a	Second, Herein and below specifically show the Dharma gate.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a13_3']	此乃指經智淵無邊而為智德，百千三昧而為斷德，此之二德能收一切莊嚴法門也。	此乃指經智淵無邊而為智德，百千三昧而為斷德，此之二德能收一切莊嚴法門也。	05a	This refers to the boundless ocean of wisdom in the sūtra as wisdom virtue, and the hundreds of thousands of samādhis as the virtue of elimination. These two virtues are able to gather all the adornments of the Dharma gate.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a14_7']	學者若於色心分隔而解此義，則永不識法身相好也。	學者若於色心分隔而解此義，則永不識法身相好也。	05a	If learners understand this meaning by dividing form and mind, then they will never recognize the characteristics and merits of the Dharma body.

One must understand that the former does not know the latter, and one must understand that the latter must see the former, because the former is coarse and the latter is wonderful.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a19_6']	今四天王是大菩薩，就圓稱歎，見三身相與妙三德無二無別，應是解脫，豈隔二德？	今四天王是大菩薩，就圓稱歎，見三身相與妙三德無二無別，應是解脫，豈隔二德？	05a	Now the Four Heavenly Kings are great bodhisattvas. From the perfect perspective, they praise and see the characteristics of the three bodies and the wonderful three virtues as non-dual and non-separate. This corresponds to liberation. How could it be separated from the two virtues?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a19_11']	報法準知。	報法準知。	05a	The reward and Dharma can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a20_4']	欲彰此義，是故特云無有障礙。	欲彰此義，是故特云無有障礙。	05a	In order to reveal this meaning, therefore, it is specifically said that there is no obstruction.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a21_1']	若知此意，方是深達金光明法門也。	若知此意，方是深達金光明法門也。	05a	If one understands this meaning, then one truly deeply understands the Dharma gate of the Golden Light.

['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a25_14']	言佛化為四身者，法身妙色而為化法，報應二身照理鑑機而為化主，曲順機緣現九界身而為化事。	言佛化為四身者，法身妙色而為化法，報應二身照理鑑機而為化主，曲順機緣現九界身而為化事。	05a	As for the Buddha manifesting the four bodies, the wondrous form of the Dharma body is the Dharma of transformation, the two bodies of reward and response illuminate principle and perceive the capacities of beings, and they manifest the bodies of the nine realms in accordance with karmic conditions, which is the transformed activity.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a26_9']	今以化事顯具上三，故論四身。	今以化事顯具上三，故論四身。	05a	Now, using the transformed activity to manifest the above three, therefore discussing the four bodies.

['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142a29_18']	三章是法、三身是人，攬法為人、人不離法，故云辭異其義是同。	三章是法、三身是人，攬法為人、人不離法，故云辭異其義是同。	05a	The three chapters are the Dharma, and the three bodies are the person. Embracing the Dharma to form the person, the person is not apart from the Dharma, therefore it is said that the words differ but the meaning is the same.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b01_13']	佛月清淨者，取偈初句成今三身。	佛月清淨者，取偈初句成今三身。	05a	As for the pure Buddha's moon, taking the first line of the verse to form the present three bodies.

['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b05_9']	二、料簡機應。	二、料簡機應。	05a	Second, distinguishing between the responsive and the responding.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b06_16']	上明三身無有障礙，其義幽微，猶慮學人三相不泯、情有分張。	上明三身無有障礙，其義幽微，猶慮學人三相不泯、情有分張。	05a	Above, it is explained that the three bodies are unobstructed, the meaning is profound and subtle, still fearing that students' three characteristics are not extinguished, and their feelings are divided.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b07_18']	今明三身及以所被無非法界，法界無外更何彼此？	今明三身及以所被無非法界，法界無外更何彼此？	05a	Now, it is explained that the three bodies and what they cover are all the Dharma realm, the Dharma realm has no outside, so what else is there to be here or there?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b08_12']	三、初一問答，明法外無餘。	三、初一問答，明法外無餘。	05a	Third, the first question and answer clarify that there is nothing else outside the Dharma.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b09_6']	言法不作報非報者，非報是應。	言法不作報非報者，非報是應。	05a	It is said that the Dharma does not make retribution or non-retribution, non-retribution is the response.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b09_9']	難云：	難云：	05a	The difficulty says:
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b10_4']	三身秖一法界，豈有能作作所作耶？	三身秖一法界，豈有能作作所作耶？	05a	The three bodies are only one Dharma realm, how can there be an able maker, a maker, and something to be made?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b11_9']	而言依法者，此同體依，依而復即全體之用，用還依體。	而言依法者，此同體依，依而復即全體之用，用還依體。	05a	It is said to rely on the Dharma, this is the reliance of the same essence, relying and yet fully the function of the whole essence, the function still relies on the essence.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b12_18']	二一問答，報即法界、影是應身、非影是化身，以現九界非佛像故。	二一問答，報即法界、影是應身、非影是化身，以現九界非佛像故。	05a	The second question and answer: the response is the Dharma realm, the reflection is the responsive body, and the non-reflection is the transformation body, because manifesting the nine realms is not the Buddha's image.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b14_10']	法界下注云云者，更合明於應是法界，三同祕藏，豈有一身非法界耶？	法界下注云云者，更合明於應是法界，三同祕藏，豈有一身非法界耶？	05a	The note under Dharma realm says and so on, which further combines the explanation that the response is the Dharma realm, the three are the same as the secret treasury, how can there be a body that is not the Dharma realm?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b15_4']	三、「又並」下一問答，明機外無應。	三、「又並」下一問答，明機外無應。	05a	Third, the question and answer below Moreover clarifies that there is no response outside the capacity.

['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b16_20', 'ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b17_9']	初、設並顯。🔽動譬機生，不能覩應。	初、設並顯。 動譬機生，不能覩應。	05a	First, setting up a parallel to show.🔽Motion is a metaphor for the arising of capacity, which cannot see the response.

['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b18_4']	水譬正因。	水譬正因。	05a	Water is a metaphor for the correct cause.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b19_8']	安樂性者，即大涅槃既是三德，性必妙融，寧非法界？	安樂性者，即大涅槃既是三德，性必妙融，寧非法界？	05a	The nature of bliss is precisely great nirvana. Since it is the three virtues, the nature must be wonderfully integrated. How can it not be the Dharma realm?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b20_6']	故〈自他不二門〉云「物機無量，不出三千。	故〈自他不二門〉云「物機無量，不出三千。	05a	Therefore, the chapter on The Non-Duality of Self and Other says: The immeasurable capacities of beings are not beyond the three thousand.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b20_16']	能應雖多，不出十界。	能應雖多，不出十界。	05a	Although the responses are many, they do not go beyond the ten realms.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b21_4']	物機應契，身土無偏。	物機應契，身土無偏。	05a	When the capacities of beings and the responses accord, the bodies and lands are impartial.

['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b24_17']	今從圓說，始窮經意，良以自他性本不二，方有能感及有能資。	今從圓說，始窮經意，良以自他性本不二，方有能感及有能資。	05a	Now, following the perfect teaching, it begins to exhaust the meaning of the sutra. The reason is that the nature of self and other is originally non-dual, and only then can there be the able to respond and the able to assist.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b25_10']	因感出世者，即十界機感。	因感出世者，即十界機感。	05a	As for the cause of responding to the world, it refers to the capacities of the ten realms.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b27_6']	十界應也，以生地獄與佛地獄性不二故，方能感見地獄之應，乃至感佛亦復如是。	十界應也，以生地獄與佛地獄性不二故，方能感見地獄之應，乃至感佛亦復如是。	05a	The ten realms respond, because the nature of the hells and the Buddha's hells is non-dual, one is able to respond to and see the hells. Up to responding to the Buddha, it is also like this.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b28_6']	今宗所論感應皆具十法界者，為顯不二。	今宗所論感應皆具十法界者，為顯不二。	05a	The discussion of the present school regarding the response of the ten dharma realms is to manifest non-duality.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142b29_10']	義若不然，豈惟眾生不能感佛，抑亦十處不成法界。	義若不然，豈惟眾生不能感佛，抑亦十處不成法界。	05a	If the meaning is not so, not only can sentient beings not move the Buddha, but also the ten places do not form the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c01_1']	宜深究之，宜深究之。	宜深究之，宜深究之。	05a	You should investigate deeply, you should investigate deeply.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c01_17']	由生成佛者，眾生能作成佛勝緣也。	由生成佛者，眾生能作成佛勝緣也。	05a	As for because of generating and becoming a Buddha, sentient beings are able to create the supreme conditions for becoming a Buddha.

['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c03_6']	而惡逆者其功最強，如無達多，佛豈成道？	而惡逆者其功最強，如無達多，佛豈成道？	05a	But those who commit grave offenses have the strongest merit, just like Devadatta. How could the Buddha have attained enlightenment?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c04_4']	然若惡法本非佛性，何能資助菩薩成佛？	然若惡法本非佛性，何能資助菩薩成佛？	05a	However, if evil dharmas are originally not Buddha-nature, how can they assist bodhisattvas in becoming Buddhas?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c05_12']	菩薩不觀生為法界，非同體悲、非無作行，何能成就大菩提果？	菩薩不觀生為法界，非同體悲、非無作行，何能成就大菩提果？	05a	Bodhisattvas do not view sentient beings as the Dharma realm. If it is not compassion that takes all beings as oneself, and not practice without conceptualization, how can they accomplish the great fruit of supreme enlightenment?
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c06_7']	若其佛外有一眾生，非佛法界；	若其佛外有一眾生，非佛法界；	05a	If there is a single sentient being outside of the Buddha, not the Dharma realm of the Buddha;
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c06_17']	生外有佛，法界不成。	生外有佛，法界不成。	05a	If there is a Buddha outside of sentient beings, the Dharma realm is not complete.
['ZH_T39_1786_05a:0142c07_11']	不作此解，未超三藏，何況通別？	不作此解，未超三藏，何況通別？	05a	If one does not understand this, one has not transcended the Tripiṭaka teachings, let alone the Shared and Distinct teachings.
