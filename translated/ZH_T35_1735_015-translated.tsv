['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c20_12']	謂田既是一，植福應齊，施報有差，由何而起？	謂田既是一，植福應齊，施報有差，由何而起？	015	It means that since the field is the same, planting blessings should be equal. The rewards for giving have differences. From what do they arise?

['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c22_15']	云田雖齊等，心有高下，容可有殊。	云田雖齊等，心有高下，容可有殊。	015	It says that although the field is the same, the mind has high and low, and it is possible to have differences.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c23_7']	既心無異思，報云何異。	既心無異思，報云何異。	015	Since the mind has no different thoughts, how can the rewards be different?
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c23_12']	答有數意：	答有數意：	015	The answer has several meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c23_17']	一約眾生。	一約眾生。	015	First, in terms of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c25_1']	由器有大小、心有輕重，故得報有差，非如來咎。	由器有大小、心有輕重，故得報有差，非如來咎。	015	Because the vessels have large and small capacities, and the minds have light and heavy weights, the karmic retributions obtained are different, not the fault of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c25_16', 'ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c26_7']	二約佛遍稱差別之機，方稱平等。🔽即一之多，差不乖等；	二約佛遍稱差別之機，方稱平等。 即一之多，差不乖等；	015	Second, in terms of the Buddha's universal response to the differentiated capacities, it is then called equality.🔽Within the one, there are many; the differentiated does not contradict equality.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c26_17']	即多之一，等不礙差。	即多之一，等不礙差。	015	Within the many, there is one; equality does not obstruct differentiation.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0608c28_4']	由心平等無私，方能隨現多果，終令解脫一味，曾何異哉？	由心平等無私，方能隨現多果，終令解脫一味，曾何異哉？	015	Because the mind is impartial and equal, it can then manifest many fruits according to the capacities, and ultimately cause them to attain liberation with a single flavor. How could it be different?

['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a08_9']	後五皆約佛明。	後五皆約佛明。	015	The latter five all clarify the Buddha.

['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a17_10']	二正顯問端中四：	二正顯問端中四：	015	In the second, revealing the question, there are four parts:

['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a19_11']	一謂斷煩惱集證出離滅，此義不殊，彼此共許。	一謂斷煩惱集證出離滅，此義不殊，彼此共許。	015	First, it means cutting off afflictions and accumulating, realizing the cessation of liberation. This meaning is not different, and both sides agree.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a20_2']	二謂多人同見，所見不異。	二謂多人同見，所見不異。	015	Second, it means many people have the same view, and what they see is not different.

['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a20_18']	難亦有二：	難亦有二：	015	The difficulties also have two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a21_2']	一對初義。	一對初義。	015	First, in response to the first meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a21_13']	見教之後何以久而不脫？	見教之後何以久而不脫？	015	After seeing the teachings, why do they not quickly become free?
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a22_6']	故云云何不即斷惑出離。	故云云何不即斷惑出離。	015	Therefore it says, Why do they not immediately cut off afflictions and leave?
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a22_11']	二對後義。	二對後義。	015	Second, in response to the latter meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a23_4']	多人同見，何以有脫不脫？	多人同見，何以有脫不脫？	015	Many people see the same thing, why are there those who are liberated and those who are not?
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a23_15']	故言云何不悉斷惑而出。	故言云何不悉斷惑而出。	015	Therefore, it is said, Why do they not all eliminate afflictions and attain liberation?
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a25_2']	三「然其」下釋成前難，正釋後義，多人苦集皆不殊故。	三「然其」下釋成前難，正釋後義，多人苦集皆不殊故。	015	Third, below However, it explains the previous difficulty and correctly explains the later meaning, because the suffering and accumulation of many people are not different.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a25_17']	五蘊是正，三界通依，此苦果也；	五蘊是正，三界通依，此苦果也；	015	The five aggregates are the correct, the three realms are the common basis, this is the result of suffering;
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a26_7']	癡愛發潤，為集因也。	癡愛發潤，為集因也。	015	Ignorance and craving give rise to and moisten, which are the causes of accumulation.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a27_2']	兼顯初義，前後苦集亦不殊故。	兼顯初義，前後苦集亦不殊故。	015	It also reveals the initial meaning, because the suffering and accumulation before and after are also not different.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a27_13']	四「是則」下結成相違。	四「是則」下結成相違。	015	Fourth, below This is then, it concludes the contradiction.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a28_12']	出者有益，不出無益，佛教是一，其義安在？	出者有益，不出無益，佛教是一，其義安在？	015	Those who leave have benefits, those who do not leave have no benefits, the Buddha's teachings are one, where is the meaning?
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609a28_16']	答意云：	答意云：	015	The meaning of the answer is:
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b01_17']	修有勤惰、障有深淺、機有生熟、緣有具闕、智有明昧、功有厚薄，故成有遲速，答初難也。	修有勤惰、障有深淺、機有生熟、緣有具闕、智有明昧、功有厚薄，故成有遲速，答初難也。	015	Cultivation has diligence and laziness, hindrances have depth and shallowness, faculties have maturity and immaturity, conditions have completeness and lack, wisdom has clarity and obscurity, and merit has thickness and thinness, therefore, there are slow and fast accomplishments, answering the first difficulty.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b02_14']	修與不修，故見同益異，答後難也。	修與不修，故見同益異，答後難也。	015	Cultivation and non-cultivation, therefore, seeing the same benefits and differences, answering the later difficulty.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b03_9']	上之別義，不出勤惰二門故。	上之別義，不出勤惰二門故。	015	The separate meanings above are not beyond the two approaches of diligence and laziness.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b03_14']	十頌分二：	十頌分二：	015	The ten verses are divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b04_18']	初一開章許說，謂上半許稱實而說、下半開二章門；	初一開章許說，謂上半許稱實而說、下半開二章門；	015	The first verse opens the chapter and allows speaking, meaning that in the first half it allows speaking in accordance with reality, and in the second half it opens two chapter headings;
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b05_18']	餘九別釋，初一釋速解脫、後八釋難出離。	餘九別釋，初一釋速解脫、後八釋難出離。	015	The remaining nine verses explain separately, with the first explaining quick liberation and the latter eight explaining difficulty in leaving.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b06_12']	今初，上半牒疑、下半為釋。	今初，上半牒疑、下半為釋。	015	Now, the first half raises doubts, and the second half provides an explanation.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b07_9']	勤則通策萬行，離身心相，故能速出。	勤則通策萬行，離身心相，故能速出。	015	Diligence universally encourages myriad practices, and being free from the characteristics of body and mind, one is thus able to quickly leave.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b07_14']	然有五相：	然有五相：	015	However, there are five aspects:
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b08_16']	一有勢力，由被甲精進故，謂於佛法中發大誓願；	一有勢力，由被甲精進故，謂於佛法中發大誓願；	015	First, having power, due to armor-like vigor, meaning making great vows within the Buddha's teachings;
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b09_15']	二勇捍，謂於廣大法中無怯劣精進故；	二勇捍，謂於廣大法中無怯劣精進故；	015	Second, being brave, meaning being free from cowardice and inferiority in the vast Dharma, due to vigor;
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b10_15']	三堅猛，由寒熱蚊虻等所不能動精進故；	三堅猛，由寒熱蚊虻等所不能動精進故；	015	Third, being firm and fierce, due to not being moved by cold, heat, mosquitoes, gadflies, etc., due to vigor;
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b11_16']	四常不捨善軛，由於無下劣無喜足精進故；	四常不捨善軛，由於無下劣無喜足精進故；	015	Fourth, always not abandoning the yoke of goodness, due to being free from inferiority and contentment, due to vigor;
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b12_10']	五精進，由加行精進故。	五精進，由加行精進故。	015	Fifth, vigor, due to the vigor of added effort.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b13_11']	由斯五相發勤精進，速證通慧，滅障解脫。	由斯五相發勤精進，速證通慧，滅障解脫。	015	Due to these five aspects, one gives rise to diligent effort and quickly realizes spiritual powers, extinguishing hindrances and attaining liberation.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b14_10']	下八以喻釋難出章，總相翻前皆名懈怠。	下八以喻釋難出章，總相翻前皆名懈怠。	015	The following eight analogies explain difficulties and bring out the points, generally reversing the previous [seven] and calling them all laziness.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b17_7']	一火微樵濕喻，喻善根生及三障重，暫一聞教纔少修行，而業惑內侵，令所聞速失、所行速廢，故成懈怠，難出離也。	一火微樵濕喻，喻善根生及三障重，暫一聞教纔少修行，而業惑內侵，令所聞速失、所行速廢，故成懈怠，難出離也。	015	The first, the analogy of small fire with wet firewood, illustrates the arising of wholesome roots and the heaviness of the three hindrances. Temporarily hearing the teachings once and practicing a little, yet karma and afflictions inwardly encroach, causing what is heard to be quickly lost and what is practiced to be quickly abandoned, thus forming laziness, making it difficult to escape.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b18_1']	二鑽火數息喻，喻修有懈退。	二鑽火數息喻，喻修有懈退。	015	The second, the analogy of drilling for fire and stopping frequently, illustrates the slackness in cultivation.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b19_12', 'ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b20_6']	然此下喻多通三慧以辨懈怠，此喻約聞，即聽習數息，明解不生；🔽約思即決擇數息，真智不生；	然此下喻多通三慧以辨懈怠，此喻約聞，即聽習數息，明解不生； 約思即決擇數息，真智不生；	015	However, this analogy often covers the three wisdoms in distinguishing laziness. This analogy, regarding hearing, clarifies that understanding does not arise from frequently listening and practicing.🔽Regarding contemplation, it clarifies that true wisdom does not arise from frequently discerning.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b20_19']	約修即定慧數息，聖道不生。	約修即定慧數息，聖道不生。	015	Regarding cultivation, it clarifies that the holy path does not arise from frequently counting the breath in concentration and wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b21_17']	聖道如火能燒惑薪，煖頂已前皆名未熱。	聖道如火能燒惑薪，煖頂已前皆名未熱。	015	The holy path is like fire that can burn the firewood of afflictions. Before the stage of heat and peak, it is all called not yet hot.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b23_4']	已熱而息火尚不生，未熱數息雖經年劫終無得理。	已熱而息火尚不生，未熱數息雖經年劫終無得理。	015	If the fire is already hot and you stop blowing, the fire will still not be born. If you count the breath without heat, even if you spend years and eons, you will never attain the principle.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b24_2']	故《遺教》對此明小水長流則能穿石。	故《遺教》對此明小水長流則能穿石。	015	Therefore, the Sutra of the Buddha's Last Teachings clarifies this with the analogy of a small stream of water that can still wear through a rock.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b25_2']	禪宗六祖共傳斯喻，願諸學者銘心書紳。	禪宗六祖共傳斯喻，願諸學者銘心書紳。	015	The Chan School's Six Patriarchs all transmit this analogy. I wish all learners to engrave it in their hearts and write it on their sashes.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b28_2']	若直就修行以釋，當以智慧鑽注於一境，以方便繩善巧迴轉，心智無住四儀無間則聖道可生，瞥爾起心暫時亡照皆名息也。	若直就修行以釋，當以智慧鑽注於一境，以方便繩善巧迴轉，心智無住四儀無間則聖道可生，瞥爾起心暫時亡照皆名息也。	015	If we directly explain it in terms of cultivation, we should use wisdom to focus on a single object, and use skillful means to skillfully turn around. If the mind and wisdom are without dwelling and the four deportments are without interruption, then the holy path can be born. If there is even a momentary thought or a brief loss of illumination, it is all called stopping.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b28_9']	三闕緣求火喻。	三闕緣求火喻。	015	Third, the analogy of seeking fire without conditions.
['ZH_T35_1735_015:0609b28_16']	物者，艾等也。	物者，艾等也。	015	Things refers to moxa and other things.
