They rob people's wholesome dharmas, making no distinction between good and bad, causing them to become destitute, solitary, and naked, and to become icchantikas. Without good protection, they are robbed by them.

Having obtained it, one contemplates and cultivates entering meditation and formlessness, relying on concentration to contemplate the Dharma, attaining the wisdom of non-arising. Relying on the wisdom of non-arising, one gives rise to the realization of suchness. Relying on the realization of suchness, one attains unobstructed cognition, and is then able to deliver sentient beings out of the suffering of birth and death, and attain the bliss of nirvana.

This means that the three kinds of defilements are all conceptualization, thus the commentary previously explained that the three kinds of defilements are all called conceptualization.
['ZH_T36_1736_060:0483b17_10']	二由念眾生，常在世間不捨離故。	二由念眾生，常在世間不捨離故。	060	Second, due to thoughts of sentient beings, one always abides in the world without abandoning it.

The treatise generally says that it is exhausted, because all dharmas taught by the Tathāgata arise in accordance with the realization of suchness.
