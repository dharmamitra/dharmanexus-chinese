['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511b23_13']	但入此大慧有種種門，或從法說門入，或從譬說門入，或從亦法亦譬門入，若因此三門悟入大慧，則三種是門；	但入此大慧有種種門，或從法說門入，或從譬說門入，或從亦法亦譬門入，若因此三門悟入大慧，則三種是門；	005	But there are various gates to enter this great wisdom, either through the gate of Dharma explanation, or through the gate of simile explanation, or through the gate of both Dharma and simile. If one awakens to and enters the great wisdom through these three gates, then the three are gates;

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511b27_4']	故《涅槃經》云「或有服甘露，壽命得長存，或有服甘露，傷命而早夭，無礙智甘露，所謂大乘典，如是大乘典，亦名雜毒藥」。	故《涅槃經》云「或有服甘露，壽命得長存，或有服甘露，傷命而早夭，無礙智甘露，所謂大乘典，如是大乘典，亦名雜毒藥」。	005	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says: Some drink the nectar of immortality and attain longevity, while some drink the nectar of immortality and lose their lives early. The nectar of unobstructed wisdom is called the Mahayana canon. Such a Mahayana canon is also called a mixed poison.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511b29_10']	但上根之人聞法說已解，無待譬喻，故涅槃經云「乃為利根人說大乘九部經略於譬喻」，即其事也。	但上根之人聞法說已解，無待譬喻，故涅槃經云「乃為利根人說大乘九部經略於譬喻」，即其事也。	005	However, those of the highest capacity understand upon hearing the doctrinal explanation, without needing parables. Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, For the sake of those of sharp faculties, the Mahayana nine-part scriptures are expounded, with few parables, which is exactly the case.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c02_1']	中根之徒未能忘言領法，故聞法說不解，而能虛心待譬，故為說譬喻。	中根之徒未能忘言領法，故聞法說不解，而能虛心待譬，故為說譬喻。	005	Those of middling capacity are unable to forget words and grasp the Dharma, so they do not understand upon hearing the doctrinal explanation, but they are able to empty their minds and await parables, so parables are expounded for them.

Borrowing from the distant to illustrate the near, as the Nirvana Sutra says, For example, nirvana is neither existent nor non-existent, and offenses are also like this, neither existent nor non-existent.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c15_3']	三、以近喻近，如《中論》云「國無鍮石，譬之如金」。	三、以近喻近，如《中論》云「國無鍮石，譬之如金」。	005	3. Using the near to illustrate the near, as the Zhong Lun says, The country has no brass, it is likened to gold.

Since the first chapter already has a separate title of Chapter on Skillful Means, what name does it receive now?

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c21_1']	所言別者，法說語通，方便名別，故從別為稱。	所言別者，法說語通，方便名別，故從別為稱。	005	What is meant by specific? The teaching on the Dharma is general, while the name skillful means is specific, so it is named based on the specific.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c22_9']	今言譬喻，其語則通，故從通為目，斯則法喻雙舉、通別互題也。	今言譬喻，其語則通，故從通為目，斯則法喻雙舉、通別互題也。	005	Now, the parables are general, so it is named based on the general. This is the mutual titles of the specific and general, and the parables and teaching on the Dharma.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c23_8']	答：	答：	005	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c24_10']	若前品是法、今譬上法者，則先法後譬，謂後喻也。	若前品是法、今譬上法者，則先法後譬，謂後喻也。	005	If the previous chapter is the Dharma and the present chapter is a metaphor for the Dharma, then it is Dharma first and metaphor later, which is the later metaphor.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c25_11']	若就此品而言，未有法說，前明於譬，是前喻也。	若就此品而言，未有法說，前明於譬，是前喻也。	005	If we speak in terms of this chapter, there is no Dharma explanation yet, and the previous chapter clarifies the metaphor, which is the earlier metaphor.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c26_1']	又今火宅喻是遍喻也。	又今火宅喻是遍喻也。	005	Moreover, the present parable of the burning house is a universal metaphor.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c26_10']	八種喻中可含三也。	八種喻中可含三也。	005	Among the eight kinds of metaphors, it can contain three.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c27_19']	但法譬二名其義不定，人多謂譬但為事、法定是理，此實不然。	但法譬二名其義不定，人多謂譬但為事、法定是理，此實不然。	005	But the meanings of the two terms Dharma and metaphor are not fixed. Many people think that metaphors are only for events and the Dharma is definitely principle, but this is not so.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c28_15']	《大經》云「譬如涅槃」，則涅槃為譬；	《大經》云「譬如涅槃」，則涅槃為譬；	005	The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, It is like nirvāṇa, then nirvāṇa becomes the metaphor;
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0511c29_13']	「喻如金剛」，則金剛為譬，故知法譬之名義無定也。	「喻如金剛」，則金剛為譬，故知法譬之名義無定也。	005	It is likened to a vajra, then the vajra becomes the metaphor. Therefore, we know that the terms Dharma and metaphor have no fixed meaning.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a03_5']	以不定故，可得法以為譬、譬以為法，以譬為法則法非定法，以法為譬則譬非定譬，當知非法非譬強名法譬。	以不定故，可得法以為譬、譬以為法，以譬為法則法非定法，以法為譬則譬非定譬，當知非法非譬強名法譬。	005	Because they are not fixed, the Dharma can be used as a metaphor and a metaphor can be used as the Dharma. If a metaphor is used as the Dharma, then the Dharma is not a fixed Dharma. If the Dharma is used as a metaphor, then the metaphor is not a fixed metaphor. One should know that it is not the Dharma and not a metaphor, yet it is forcefully called the Dharma and metaphor.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a05_21']	故因此法譬為令眾生了悟正道非法非譬，故上文言「是法不可示言辭相寂滅」，寄言題品令悟無言，故云「譬喻品」也。	故因此法譬為令眾生了悟正道非法非譬，故上文言「是法不可示言辭相寂滅」，寄言題品令悟無言，故云「譬喻品」也。	005	Therefore, based on this Dharma and parables, it is for causing sentient beings to understand the right path, which is neither Dharma nor parable. Therefore, the above text says, This Dharma cannot be shown, the characteristics of words are quiescent and extinguished. It uses words to name the chapter, causing understanding of the absence of words, thus it is called the Chapter on Parables.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a07_5']	立品名應從「爾時舍利弗白佛言，我今無復疑悔」文安之。	立品名應從「爾時舍利弗白佛言，我今無復疑悔」文安之。	005	The name of the chapter should be placed after the text where Śāriputra says to the Buddha, I now have no more doubts or regrets.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a08_11']	而卷初身子領解如來述成及與授記，此之三章未是譬喻。	而卷初身子領解如來述成及與授記，此之三章未是譬喻。	005	But at the beginning of the scroll, Śāriputra's understanding, the Tathāgata's confirmation, and the bestowal of the prophecy, these three sections are not yet parables.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a09_6']	而忽在此立品名者，有人言：	而忽在此立品名者，有人言：	005	As for suddenly establishing the name of the chapter here, some people say:
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a11_3']	上根人領解，望下立「信解品」，應別立品名，但文少不足別題，故寄〈譬喻品〉初說也。	上根人領解，望下立「信解品」，應別立品名，但文少不足別題，故寄〈譬喻品〉初說也。	005	The understanding of the people of the highest capacity, looking down, establishes the Chapter on Belief and Understanding. It should have a separate name for the chapter, but the text is short and not enough for a separate title, so it is mentioned at the beginning of the Chapter on Parables.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a13_4']	今明身子要由解前法說方能請後譬喻，故後譬由前領法，所以立譬喻品在領解之初也。	今明身子要由解前法說方能請後譬喻，故後譬由前領法，所以立譬喻品在領解之初也。	005	Now, it is explained that Śāriputra must understand the previous explanation of the Dharma in order to request the subsequent parables, therefore, the parables are due to the understanding of the Dharma, and thus the Parable Chapter is established at the beginning of the understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a14_8']	「爾時舍利弗」下，此是法說中第二大段，上根人領解。	「爾時舍利弗」下，此是法說中第二大段，上根人領解。	005	At that time, Śāriputra and below, this is the second major section in the explanation of the Dharma, the understanding of those with the highest capacity.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a15_7']	所以得領解者，以教是緣教，故言教稱緣；	所以得領解者，以教是緣教，故言教稱緣；	005	The reason they were able to understand is because the teaching is the condition for the teaching, therefore it is said that the teaching accords with the conditions;
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a15_18']	緣是教緣，故言緣稱教。	緣是教緣，故言緣稱教。	005	the conditions are the conditions for the teaching, therefore it is said that the conditions accord with the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a17_6']	教稱緣故應病授藥，緣稱教故如法服行，是故上根即便領悟也。	教稱緣故應病授藥，緣稱教故如法服行，是故上根即便領悟也。	005	Because the teaching accords with the conditions, the medicine is given according to the illness; because the conditions accord with the teaching, the practice is carried out according to the Dharma, and therefore those with the highest capacity immediately understood.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a18_8']	何故眾經得道不陣領悟，此教受解而自敘耶？	何故眾經得道不陣領悟，此教受解而自敘耶？	005	Why is it that in other sūtras attaining the Way is not immediately understood, but in this teaching acceptance and understanding are described by oneself?
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a18_10']	答：	答：	005	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a19_9']	為是義故眾教不同，若須一類，何名多部？	為是義故眾教不同，若須一類，何名多部？	005	It is for this meaning that the various teachings are not the same. If they must be of one kind, how can they be called the many schools?
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a20_10']	又《法華》之前大小分流，《法華》之後三一已會。	又《法華》之前大小分流，《法華》之後三一已會。	005	Moreover, before the Lotus Sūtra, the Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna flowed separately. After the Lotus Sūtra, the three and one had already been harmonized.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a21_18']	此經既是大小交際，反三之始、歸一之初，以義難明，故須述解。	此經既是大小交際，反三之始、歸一之初，以義難明，故須述解。	005	Since this sutra is the juncture of the great and small vehicles, the beginning of the reversal of the three, and the beginning of the return to the one, it is difficult to understand the meaning, so it is necessary to explain it.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a22_17']	又小乘之人而信大法，雖言已解容有僻謬；	又小乘之人而信大法，雖言已解容有僻謬；	005	Moreover, those of the lesser vehicle who believe in the great Dharma, although they say they have already understood, may have biased errors;

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a27_3']	又若上根人不序領悟，則中下之流便謂無人得解，教便虛設則望崖而退，為欲誨引迷情故須述解也。	又若上根人不序領悟，則中下之流便謂無人得解，教便虛設則望崖而退，為欲誨引迷情故須述解也。	005	Moreover, if those of the highest capacity do not express their understanding, then those of the middle and lower ranks may think that no one can understand it, and the teaching will be set up in vain, so they will give up in despair. In order to guide and inspire deluded minds, it is necessary to explain it.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a28_11']	又佛上自說則是大人化小人，今身子陳悟則是小人化小人。	又佛上自說則是大人化小人，今身子陳悟則是小人化小人。	005	Moreover, the Buddha's explanation above is that of a great person transforming lesser people, while Śāriputra's expression of understanding is that of a lesser person transforming lesser people.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512a29_19']	又上父化於子，今是子化子，以義兼二化，故取信不難。	又上父化於子，今是子化子，以義兼二化，故取信不難。	005	Moreover, above it is the father transforming the son, and now it is the son transforming the son. Since the meaning encompasses both transformations, it is not difficult to gain belief.

This is all in accordance with their rational capacity and is not enough to be described as understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512b03_10']	今忽小人悟大，蓋是教所希聞，故須述解；	今忽小人悟大，蓋是教所希聞，故須述解；	005	Now, a small person suddenly awakens to the great, which is what the teaching hopes to hear, so it is necessary to describe the understanding;
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0512b05_2']	若不述解，容言小人終不悟大，無得佛理則還同昔經，則今教空設也。	若不述解，容言小人終不悟大，無得佛理則還同昔經，則今教空設也。	005	If the understanding is not described, it may be said that a small person will never awaken to the great, and if there is no attainment of the principle of Buddhahood, it would be the same as the teachings of the past, and the present teaching would be set up in vain.

From the perspective of the teachings, the length of time is just appropriate. From the perspective of realizing non-arising, the length of time is also according to one's wishes.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0518c24_2']	故〈方便品〉云「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相」。	故〈方便品〉云「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相」。	005	Therefore, the chapter on skillful means says, All dharmas from the very beginning are always characterized by quiescence and extinction.

For the sake of the bodhisattvas, the twelve links of dependent arising are taught as non-arising and non-ceasing. Therefore, there are two meanings of contemplation, one of arising and ceasing and one of non-arising and non-ceasing, for the two vehicles of the Great and Small Vehicles.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a02_16']	答：	答：	005	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a04_13']	菩薩了無量四聖諦亦本來不生不滅，故無明體性本自不有，妄想因緣和合而生。	菩薩了無量四聖諦亦本來不生不滅，故無明體性本自不有，妄想因緣和合而生。	005	The bodhisattva understands that the four noble truths of immeasurability are also originally non-arising and non-ceasing. Therefore, the essence of ignorance is originally non-existent, and arises due to the combination of deluded thoughts and conditions.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a06_18']	既言妄想因緣而生，有集為能生、苦為所生，此即是無生滅生滅，雖生滅不生滅也，故與二乘不同。	既言妄想因緣而生，有集為能生、苦為所生，此即是無生滅生滅，雖生滅不生滅也，故與二乘不同。	005	Since it is said that [the five aggregates] arise from deluded conceptualization and causes and conditions, there is accumulation as the producer and suffering as the produced. This is precisely non-arising and non-cessation arising and ceasing. Although arising and ceasing, they are non-arising and non-ceasing, therefore they are different from the two vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a08_11']	又言五眾生滅者，小乘人言五眾無常苦空無我，今略舉無常故云生滅。	又言五眾生滅者，小乘人言五眾無常苦空無我，今略舉無常故云生滅。	005	Moreover, the followers of the Lesser Vehicle say that the five aggregates are impermanent, suffering, empty, and without self. Now, since impermanence is briefly mentioned, it is said to be arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a09_8']	又云有觀為生、空觀為滅，故云生滅。	又云有觀為生、空觀為滅，故云生滅。	005	It is also said that the contemplation of existence is arising and the contemplation of emptiness is cessation, therefore it is said to be arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a11_7']	又二乘未得有餘有煩惱生，得有餘則煩惱滅，未入無餘則身智生，入無餘則身智滅。	又二乘未得有餘有煩惱生，得有餘則煩惱滅，未入無餘則身智生，入無餘則身智滅。	005	Moreover, those of the two vehicles who have not yet attained the remainderless [nirvāṇa] have the arising of afflictions. Having attained the remainderless [nirvāṇa], the afflictions cease. Before entering the remainderless [nirvāṇa], the body and wisdom arise. Having entered the remainderless [nirvāṇa], the body and wisdom cease.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a12_6']	今明煩惱之與身智本自不生，今亦無滅。	今明煩惱之與身智本自不生，今亦無滅。	005	Now, it is clarified that afflictions and the body and wisdom are originally unborn and now also non-ceasing.

Now, wishing to approach from a different perspective, it is said that the five aggregates are non-arising and non-ceasing, neither permanent nor impermanent.

Now, knowing that they are originally not arising and not ceasing, one changes the two attachments.

Therefore, the sutra says, All conditioned things are impermanent, they are the dharma of arising and ceasing. How can it be said that the five aggregates arising and ceasing are the Lesser Vehicle?

Speaking of the five aggregates arising and ceasing is merely for the purpose of the counteractive siddhānta.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a23_11']	若第一義悉檀，即說五眾不生不滅。	若第一義悉檀，即說五眾不生不滅。	005	If it is the ultimate meaning siddhānta, then it explains that the five aggregates are not arising and not ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0519a25_16']	若悟第一義悉檀則生實觀，實觀即是妙慧，妙慧即是妙法，妙法即是一乘，是故說五眾不生不滅也。	若悟第一義悉檀則生實觀，實觀即是妙慧，妙慧即是妙法，妙法即是一乘，是故說五眾不生不滅也。	005	If one awakens to the supreme truth of the siddhānta, one gives rise to true contemplation. True contemplation is precisely wondrous wisdom, wondrous wisdom is precisely the wondrous Dharma, the wondrous Dharma is precisely the One Vehicle, therefore it is said that the five aggregates are neither produced nor extinguished.

Praising the Tathāgata's virtues as being perfectly round and his afflictions as being completely exhausted.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0520b06_12']	德無不圜故解救患之方，累無不盡故能濟物之累，此為化物之本故先明之。	德無不圜故解救患之方，累無不盡故能濟物之累，此為化物之本故先明之。	005	Because the virtues are perfectly round, he understands the methods for saving from suffering.

Therefore, there is the second parable of seeing the fire.

As for the four parables that are born from the former, the parable of seeing the fire is born from the former text I observe with the Buddha-eye and see the beings of the six paths.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522b09_16']	一者、通序。	一者、通序。	005	First, a general introduction.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522b11_15']	三界並皆轉變具受眾災，若爾既常有火宅亦常有火災，此二實是一時，但說成前後耳。	三界並皆轉變具受眾災，若爾既常有火宅亦常有火災，此二實是一時，但說成前後耳。	005	The three realms all undergo transformation and experience various calamities. If so, since there is always a burning house, there is also always a fire calamity. These two are actually simultaneous, but they are spoken of as if they occur before and after.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522b13_7']	前明舍宅序其無常，後辨火災明具眾苦，苦與無常是物所患故偏說之。	前明舍宅序其無常，後辨火災明具眾苦，苦與無常是物所患故偏說之。	005	First, explaining the house illustrates its impermanence, and later discussing the fire calamity illustrates its possession of various sufferings.

Since the Buddha has passed away, they give rise to afflictions again. Because of afflictions, they experience various suffering results. Therefore, the burning house is explained first, and the arising of the fire is discussed later.

The five hundred people generally illustrate the beings of the five paths, while the thirty sons specifically clarify those who have previously received the teachings.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c06_16']	今別明三十子，雖是五道所攝但別有三乘根性，故別說之。	今別明三十子，雖是五道所攝但別有三乘根性，故別說之。	005	Now, the thirty children are specifically discussed. Although they are included in the five realms, they only have the potential for the three vehicles, so they are specifically mentioned.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c07_14']	昔曾稟教生善，善從佛生，詺善為子。	昔曾稟教生善，善從佛生，詺善為子。	005	In the past, they received the teachings and gave rise to goodness. Goodness arises from the Buddha, so goodness is called a child.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c08_5']	以善目人，人受子名也。	以善目人，人受子名也。	005	Goodness is used to refer to people, and people receive the name of children.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c08_8']	舊云：	舊云：	005	The old explanation says:
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c10_1']	「十」譬聲聞，「二」十譬緣覺，「三十」譬菩薩，聲聞德少故數少，菩薩德多故數多。	「十」譬聲聞，「二」十譬緣覺，「三十」譬菩薩，聲聞德少故數少，菩薩德多故數多。	005	Ten is likened to śrāvakas, two tens to pratyekabuddhas, and thirty to bodhisattvas. Since śrāvakas have few virtues, their number is small. Bodhisattvas have many virtues, so their number is large.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c10_4']	又云：	又云：	005	It is also said:

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c13_1']	今並不同此二義，以「十」譬菩薩，「二十」譬緣覺，「三十」譬聲聞。	今並不同此二義，以「十」譬菩薩，「二十」譬緣覺，「三十」譬聲聞。	005	Now, both of these two explanations are incorrect. Ten is likened to bodhisattvas, twenty to pratyekabuddhas, and thirty to śrāvakas.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c20_8']	子有定數，何故言或至三十耶？	子有定數，何故言或至三十耶？	005	Why does it say or up to thirty when the number of disciples is fixed?
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c20_10']	答：	答：	005	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c20_15']	凡有三義：	凡有三義：	005	There are three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c22_5']	一者、或開聲聞緣覺為二乘，或合為一小乘，以開合不定所以言或。	一者、或開聲聞緣覺為二乘，或合為一小乘，以開合不定所以言或。	005	First, sometimes the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas are divided into two vehicles, and sometimes they are combined into one small vehicle. Since the division and combination are not fixed, it says or.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0522c23_13']	例如上「一百二百乃至五百」，修羅或開或合故有「乃至」之言。	例如上「一百二百乃至五百」，修羅或開或合故有「乃至」之言。	005	For example, above it says one hundred, two hundred, up to five hundred, the asuras are sometimes included and sometimes not, so there is the phrase up to.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a01_16']	二者、就昔三乘根性不定，如《大品》六十菩薩退為羅漢，迦葉本是緣覺根性，值佛故成聲聞，聲聞之人若不值佛即成緣覺，以不定故所以言或。	二者、就昔三乘根性不定，如《大品》六十菩薩退為羅漢，迦葉本是緣覺根性，值佛故成聲聞，聲聞之人若不值佛即成緣覺，以不定故所以言或。	005	Second, based on the uncertain spiritual capacities of the three vehicles in the past, as in the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra where sixty bodhisattvas regress to becoming arhats. Kāśyapa originally had the spiritual capacity for becoming a pratyekabuddha, but because he encountered the Buddha he became a śrāvaka. Śrāvaka disciples, if they do not encounter the Buddha, become pratyekabuddhas. Because of their uncertainty, the word or is used.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a02_20']	三者、昔雖有三乘根性終並成菩薩，故復云「或」也。	三者、昔雖有三乘根性終並成菩薩，故復云「或」也。	005	Third, although there were three types of spiritual capacities in the past, they will all eventually become bodhisattvas, so it is said or again.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a03_17']	「長者見是大火」下，第二、明見火譬。	「長者見是大火」下，第二、明見火譬。	005	The elder sees this great fire is the second, the simile of seeing the fire.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a05_16']	此譬所以來者，上歎佛德無不圓、累無不盡，今見子累無不圓、德無不盡，故起大悲心也。	此譬所以來者，上歎佛德無不圓、累無不盡，今見子累無不圓、德無不盡，故起大悲心也。	005	The reason this simile is presented is that above it praises the Buddha's virtues as being complete and his afflictions as being exhausted. Now, seeing the disciples' afflictions as being complete and their virtues as being exhausted, he gives rise to the mind of great compassion.

['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a12_15']	初有三句，一、能見；	初有三句，一、能見；	005	The first part has three sentences: First, the one who sees;
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a12_20']	二、所見；	二、所見；	005	Second, what is seen;
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a13_3']	三、驚怖也。	三、驚怖也。	005	Third, the fear.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a15_3']	「是長者見是」者，將欲救難故前明見，即譬如來居法身地，以佛眼見眾生無樂有苦也。	「是長者見是」者，將欲救難故前明見，即譬如來居法身地，以佛眼見眾生無樂有苦也。	005	The elder saw this - because he was about to save from the difficulty, he first clarified seeing, which is a metaphor for the Tathāgata dwelling in the ground of the Dharma-body, using the Buddha-eye to see that sentient beings have no joy but only suffering.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a15_17']	「是大火」下，第二、明所見。	「是大火」下，第二、明所見。	005	Great fire and below is the second, clarifying what was seen.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a16_6']	普燒三界故稱「大火」也。	普燒三界故稱「大火」也。	005	Because it universally burns the three realms, it is called great fire.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a16_20']	「四面起」者，即是生老病死。	「四面起」者，即是生老病死。	005	Arising on the four sides refers to birth, old age, sickness, and death.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a18_12']	《涅槃經》取譬四山，今譬之四面，生為東面，老為南面，病為西面，死為北面。	《涅槃經》取譬四山，今譬之四面，生為東面，老為南面，病為西面，死為北面。	005	The Nirvana Sutra takes the four mountains as a metaphor, and now it is compared to the four sides. Birth is the eastern side, old age is the southern side, sickness is the western side, and death is the northern side.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a19_3']	「即大驚怖」者，第三、明驚怖。	「即大驚怖」者，第三、明驚怖。	005	Immediately greatly frightened is the third, clarifying the fear.
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a20_5']	別據三十子而言者，昔經受化不應致火，故驚；	別據三十子而言者，昔經受化不應致火，故驚；	005	Specifying the thirty sons, it means that in the past they received the teaching and should not have caused the fire, so they were surprised;
['ZH_T34_1721_005:0523a21_4']	迷著苦境恐慧命將盡成一闡提，所以怖也。	迷著苦境恐慧命將盡成一闡提，所以怖也。	005	They were attached to the realm of suffering, fearing that the life of wisdom would soon be exhausted and become icchantikas, so they were frightened.

Since there are no doors to the east and west, they run and play with their backs to principle, so there is no meaning of coming out. If they turn their backs on the north and face the south, they turn their backs on delusion and face principle, so there is the meaning of coming out.
