It is not definite knowledge or attainment. The essence of suchness is tranquil and completely devoid of the two characteristics of existence and non-existence. Therefore, based on the three natures, it is all said to be non-existent. It is not that when true knowledge arises, everything becomes non-existent. It is said that both knowledge and the object of knowledge are called prajñā. True suchness is grasped without characteristics, because it does not grasp characteristics.

Although it concludes that form is not different from emptiness, without arising or ceasing, and so on, it has not yet explained the reason why form and so on do not exist. Now it reveals the reason why there are no dharmas in emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1710_002:0540c23_11']	若色等中體少是有，應依勝義有少所得，既都無得，故本皆空。	若色等中體少是有，應依勝義有少所得，既都無得，故本皆空。	If the essence of form and so on were partially existent, there should be some attainment based on the ultimate truth. Since there is absolutely nothing to attain, therefore they are all originally empty.

The dependent and perfected are not definitely the six characteristics, so non-attainment is used to explain the above non-existence.

There are false inversions and the deluded dreams of birth and death. Because of this, one delights in ultimately attaining nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T33_1710_002:0541a12_2']	既依般若達色等空，便無拘礙、苦畏、倒想，以色生死即涅槃故，何假虛求究竟圓寂？	既依般若達色等空，便無拘礙、苦畏、倒想，以色生死即涅槃故，何假虛求究竟圓寂？	Having already relied on prajñā to understand that form and so forth are empty, one is then without restriction, suffering, fear, and inverted thoughts.

The bodhisattva always takes the spoken words as the object of learning, giving rise to contemplation, seeking the true nature through contemplation, cultivating the retinue, not falsely seeking to know all realms, which is called relying on prajñā.
