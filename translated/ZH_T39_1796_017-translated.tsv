['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750b10_6']	彼祕密主！	彼祕密主！	O Lord of Secrets!
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750b12_4']	有祕密八印甚極祕密者，如來前品中說入住祕密漫荼羅法竟，時諸大會復作此念：	有祕密八印甚極祕密者，如來前品中說入住祕密漫荼羅法竟，時諸大會復作此念：	There are eight secret mudrās, which are extremely secret. After the Tathāgata explained the secret of entering and abiding in the maṇḍala in the previous chapter, the great assembly again had this thought:
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750b13_17']	「如是祕密甚為難解之法，更有何方便具足之相，速令真言行者得成就耶？	「如是祕密甚為難解之法，更有何方便具足之相，速令真言行者得成就耶？	This secret is extremely difficult to understand. Are there any other complete characteristics of expedient means that can quickly enable the practitioner of mantras to attain accomplishment?

['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750b16_11']	以不能測故，無能發問者，故佛不待彼問，但無問而自說也。	以不能測故，無能發問者，故佛不待彼問，但無問而自說也。	Because they were unable to fathom it, no one was able to ask about it. Therefore, the Buddha did not wait for their question but spoke on his own without being asked.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750b19_18']	所謂有神驗者，若行者或內或外敷列彼本尊等漫荼羅座位之時，以此八印及真言，本尊之所加持故，彼諸尊等自然降赴道場，滿彼正行之願事也。	所謂有神驗者，若行者或內或外敷列彼本尊等漫荼羅座位之時，以此八印及真言，本尊之所加持故，彼諸尊等自然降赴道場，滿彼正行之願事也。	The so-called 'efficacious' means that when the practitioner either internally or externally arranges the seats of the maṇḍala of the principal deity and so forth, because they are empowered by the eight mudrās and mantras of the principal deity, those deities will naturally descend to the ritual arena and fulfill the practitioner's vows.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750b20_13']	復於本尊位中安置，有神驗同。	復於本尊位中安置，有神驗同。	Moreover, they are placed in the position of the principal deity, with the same efficacy.

['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750b28_32']	兼漫荼羅如本尊相應者，如本尊有如是法，我亦有之，故為具也此如是一事，以上同彼尊也，謂形色坐立喜亦爾。	兼漫荼羅如本尊相應者，如本尊有如是法，我亦有之，故為具也此如是一事，以上同彼尊也，謂形色坐立喜亦爾。	In addition, the maṇḍala is in accordance with the appearance of the deity. Just as the deity has such dharmas, so do I, therefore it is complete. This one matter is the same as that deity above, referring to form, color, sitting, standing, joy, and so forth.

['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750c05_1']	如本尊住者，前雖配祕密漫荼羅，若請本尊，謂須作此法方乃可得也，若不作此則未圓也。	如本尊住者，前雖配祕密漫荼羅，若請本尊，謂須作此法方乃可得也，若不作此則未圓也。	As for abiding like the deity, although the secret maṇḍala was previously arranged, if one invites the deity, one should perform this method in order to attain it. If one does not perform this, it is not yet complete.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0750c06_11']	此經皆前後相成，共為一事綺互其文，行者甚須相照覽乃可知也。	此經皆前後相成，共為一事綺互其文，行者甚須相照覽乃可知也。	This sutra is all mutually supporting before and after, together forming one matter, and the text is intertwined. Practitioners should greatly need to illuminate each other, and then it can be known.

['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757b28_8']	如前三世無障礙戒中，先令不捨三寶，又令不捨菩提之心，此即菩薩真四重禁也。	如前三世無障礙戒中，先令不捨三寶，又令不捨菩提之心，此即菩薩真四重禁也。	As in the precepts without obstruction in the three times mentioned earlier, first do not abandon the Three Jewels, and also do not abandon the bodhi mind, which are the true four grave prohibitions for bodhisattvas.

Because bodhisattvas take refuge in the Buddha, they then accomplish the myriad practices such as the perfections in all stages, just as a seed is the cause for the arising of a fruit.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c05_3']	若捨阿字本自然之智，則一切善不得生，故捨佛即是斷一切菩薩之命，而絕其成佛之根。	若捨阿字本自然之智，則一切善不得生，故捨佛即是斷一切菩薩之命，而絕其成佛之根。	If one abandons the original natural wisdom of the letter A, then all wholesome dharmas cannot arise. Therefore, abandoning the Buddha is to sever the life of all bodhisattvas and cut off the root of their Buddhahood.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c06_12']	若行婬盜殺妄，但於道有礙，非是絕成佛之根本，故但成偷蘭也。	若行婬盜殺妄，但於道有礙，非是絕成佛之根本，故但成偷蘭也。	If one engages in sexual misconduct, stealing, killing, or lying, it only obstructs the path, but it is not the severing of the fundamental root of Buddhahood, and thus it only constitutes a sthūlātyaya offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c07_4']	以佛不可捨故，法僧亦爾。	以佛不可捨故，法僧亦爾。	Because the Buddha cannot be abandoned, the Dharma and Saṃgha are also like this.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c08_15']	如聲聞經尚云捨一卷經戒，捨七眾生一人，即和合義斷，不成具戒。	如聲聞經尚云捨一卷經戒，捨七眾生一人，即和合義斷，不成具戒。	Even in the sūtras of the śrāvakas, it is said that abandoning a single fascicle of the sūtras and precepts, or abandoning a single person from among the seven assemblies, immediately severs the meaning of harmony and does not constitute the complete precepts.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c10_12']	況一切菩薩同乘一道而至道場，佛佛無異無別，故當知隨有所捨即斷一切法命也。	況一切菩薩同乘一道而至道場，佛佛無異無別，故當知隨有所捨即斷一切法命也。	How much more so for all bodhisattvas who ride the same path to the site of enlightenment, with each Buddha being no different and no separate? Therefore, one should know that wherever there is abandonment, it is the severing of the life of all dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c11_7']	菩提心亦爾，是一切諸行之本。	菩提心亦爾，是一切諸行之本。	The mind of enlightenment is also like this, as it is the root of all practices.

['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c13_11']	如聲聞經犯重已，即非沙門非釋子，不入眾數。	如聲聞經犯重已，即非沙門非釋子，不入眾數。	It is like the śrāvaka sūtras, which state that if one commits a grave offense, one is no longer a śramaṇa, a son of Śākya, and is not counted among the assembly.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c14_20']	今此中若捨佛法僧、菩提心，即不入眾數，如彼二乘毀四重也。	今此中若捨佛法僧、菩提心，即不入眾數，如彼二乘毀四重也。	Now, if one abandons the Buddha, Dharma, Saṃgha, and the mind of enlightenment, one is not counted among the assembly, just as those of the two vehicles who violate the four grave precepts.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c16_4']	然行者自知犯戒，更自洗浣其心而重受之，即還得戒。	然行者自知犯戒，更自洗浣其心而重受之，即還得戒。	However, the practitioner himself knows that he has violated the precepts, and he washes his mind again and receives them again, and he then regains the precepts.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c17_1']	不同二乘戒，折石斷頭無再得義也。	不同二乘戒，折石斷頭無再得義也。	It is not the same as the precepts of the two vehicles, where breaking a grave precept is like breaking a rock or cutting off one's head, and there is no meaning of regaining them.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c18_8']	復次菩薩自有十重戒，如前不殺等不在其數，乃是偷蘭也。	復次菩薩自有十重戒，如前不殺等不在其數，乃是偷蘭也。	Furthermore, the bodhisattva himself has ten grave precepts, such as not killing, which are not included in the number, but are thullaccaya offenses.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c18_13']	云何十耶？	云何十耶？	What are the ten?
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c19_8']	其四如前所說，更有六重并為十也。	其四如前所說，更有六重并為十也。	The first four are as explained above, and there are six more grave precepts, making ten.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c20_5']	第五重禁者，謂不謗一切三乘經法。	第五重禁者，謂不謗一切三乘經法。	The fifth grave prohibition is not to slander the sūtras and teachings of the Three Vehicles.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c21_7']	若謗者即是謗佛法僧、謗大菩提心，故犯重也。	若謗者即是謗佛法僧、謗大菩提心，故犯重也。	If one slanders them, it is the same as slandering the Buddha, Dharma, Saṃgha, and the mind of great enlightenment, and thus one commits a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c22_18']	以祕密藏中一切方便皆是佛之方便，是故毀一一法即是謗一切法也。	以祕密藏中一切方便皆是佛之方便，是故毀一一法即是謗一切法也。	Because all skillful means in the secret treasury are the skillful means of the Buddha, therefore to slander any single dharma is to slander all dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c24_17']	乃至世間治生產業藝術等事，隨有正理相順是佛所說者亦不得謗，何況三乘法耶。	乃至世間治生產業藝術等事，隨有正理相順是佛所說者亦不得謗，何況三乘法耶。	Even worldly affairs such as agriculture, commerce, and the arts, as long as they accord with the correct principles, are also spoken by the Buddha and should not be slandered, let alone the teachings of the Three Vehicles.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c25_19']	第六不應於一切法生於慳悋，若犯，毀重禁也。	第六不應於一切法生於慳悋，若犯，毀重禁也。	Sixth, one should not be stingy with any dharma. If one violates this, it is a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c26_14']	以菩薩集一切法，本為一切眾生。	以菩薩集一切法，本為一切眾生。	Because bodhisattvas gather all dharmas originally for all sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c27_12']	若有所祕惜，即是捨菩提，故犯重也。	若有所祕惜，即是捨菩提，故犯重也。	If there is anything that is kept secret, it is abandoning bodhi, and therefore it is a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c28_18']	第七不得邪見，謂謗無因果，無佛無見道人等諸邪見皆是也。	第七不得邪見，謂謗無因果，無佛無見道人等諸邪見皆是也。	Seventh, one should not have wrong views, such as denying cause and effect, denying the existence of the Buddha, denying the existence of those who have seen the path, and so on. All wrong views are included here.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0757c29_19']	若生邪見，自然捨佛法僧及菩提，故犯重戒。	若生邪見，自然捨佛法僧及菩提，故犯重戒。	If one gives rise to wrong views, one will naturally abandon the Buddha, the Dharma, the Saṅgha, and bodhi, and therefore it is a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0758a02_6']	而聲聞但得偷蘭，是故當知方便不具足，但是隨一途說也。	而聲聞但得偷蘭，是故當知方便不具足，但是隨一途說也。	But śrāvakas only incur the offense of thullaccaya. Therefore, one should know that the skillful means are not complete, and this is just a partial explanation.

['ZH_T39_1796_017:0758a05_13']	若見其懈退而不勸發，或阻止其心，若令離無上菩提之道，即是違逆一切如來所應作事，故犯重也。	若見其懈退而不勸發，或阻止其心，若令離無上菩提之道，即是違逆一切如來所應作事，故犯重也。	If one sees their laziness and regression and does not encourage them, or blocks their aspiration, causing them to depart from the path of unsurpassed enlightenment, then one is in opposition to the duties of all Tathāgatas and thus commits a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0758a07_13']	第九於小乘人前不觀彼根而為說大法，或於大根人前不觀彼根而說小法行，犯重禁。	第九於小乘人前不觀彼根而為說大法，或於大根人前不觀彼根而說小法行，犯重禁。	The ninth is to not consider the faculties of those in the Lesser Vehicle when teaching the Great Dharma in front of them, or to not consider the faculties of those with great faculties when teaching the Lesser Dharma, and to commit a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0758a09_6']	此即是方便不具，以違逆如來方便故，差機說法為人天怨，故犯重也。	此即是方便不具，以違逆如來方便故，差機說法為人天怨，故犯重也。	This is a lack of skillful means, because it goes against the skillful means of the Tathāgata. Teaching the Dharma without regard for the capacities of the audience becomes an enemy to humans and gods, and thus one commits a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0758a11_13']	第十菩薩常當行施，然不得施與他人害物之具，謂施酒施毒藥刀杖之類一切不饒益他之具，即犯重也。	第十菩薩常當行施，然不得施與他人害物之具，謂施酒施毒藥刀杖之類一切不饒益他之具，即犯重也。	The tenth is that bodhisattvas should always practice giving, but they should not give others the tools for harming beings, such as giving alcohol, poisonous substances, knives, and staffs - all the tools that are not beneficial to others, and thus commit a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0758a12_13']	以菩薩常行利他行，今則相背，故犯重也。	以菩薩常行利他行，今則相背，故犯重也。	Because the bodhisattva always practices benefiting others, now they turn their backs on each other, so it is a grave offense.
['ZH_T39_1796_017:0758a13_16']	當知前不殺等是將順他人意，又初入法者所持之戒。	當知前不殺等是將順他人意，又初入法者所持之戒。	One should know that the previous precepts against killing and so forth are to be in accordance with the intentions of others, and are also the precepts upheld by those who have just entered the Dharma.
