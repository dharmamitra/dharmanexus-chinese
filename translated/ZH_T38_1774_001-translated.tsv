['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303b03_1']	一者略辨、二者廣辨。	一者略辨、二者廣辨。	001	First, a brief discussion; second, an extensive discussion.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303b05_3']	言略辨者，竊以法性致深，體遍法界、用周宇宙，體遍法界故遠近難量、用周宇宙故空有豈測。	言略辨者，竊以法性致深，體遍法界、用周宇宙，體遍法界故遠近難量、用周宇宙故空有豈測。	001	As for the brief discussion, I humbly think that the nature of Dharma is profound, pervading the Dharma realm and its function extending throughout the universe. Since its essence pervades the Dharma realm, it is difficult to measure its distance; since its function extends throughout the universe, how can its emptiness and existence be fathomed?
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303b05_13']	良真理同□□□□□。	良真理同□□□□□。	001	The truth is truly the same as the Dharma realm,

['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303b09_5']	無所不融故理事俱現一心之鏡，無所不照故鏡智同潛一如之海，是義至聖圓智方等究證。	無所不融故理事俱現一心之鏡，無所不照故鏡智同潛一如之海，是義至聖圓智方等究證。	001	Because there is nothing that is not fused, both principle and phenomena appear simultaneously in the mirror of the one mind. Because there is nothing that is not illuminated, the mirror-like cognition and the hidden one suchness of the ocean are the same. This meaning is realized to the utmost by the perfect cognition of the supreme sage.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303b10_2']	是故彌勒大士位登妙覺，迹垂娑婆。	是故彌勒大士位登妙覺，迹垂娑婆。	001	Therefore, the great being Maitreya, having attained the wondrous enlightenment, manifests in the Saha world.

['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303b19_2']	二為於正法生尊重心，顯已所聞令生信故。	二為於正法生尊重心，顯已所聞令生信故。	001	Second, it is to generate a sense of reverence for the true Dharma, to manifest what he has heard and generate faith.

['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c03_7']	所以然者，如來善權方便，非□。	所以然者，如來善權方便，非□。	001	The reason for this is that the Tathāgata's skillful means are not limited.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c04_13']	□□可□□異□□相雖然□□說□經所被□□□二種：	□□可□□異□□相雖然□□說□經所被□□□二種：	001	As for the two kinds of beings that the sutra is directed towards, although the characteristics are different, the causes and conditions are the same.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c05_5']	一者聖者、二異生。	一者聖者、二異生。	001	First, the sages, second, ordinary beings.

['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c07_5']	一為此方菩薩，如經云「如來一音聲說百億陀羅尼門，彌勒菩薩應時即得」故。	一為此方菩薩，如經云「如來一音聲說百億陀羅尼門，彌勒菩薩應時即得」故。	001	First, for bodhisattvas in this realm, as the sutra says, The Tathagata speaks with one voice, expounding hundreds of billions of dharani gates, and Maitreya Bodhisattva immediately attains them.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c09_2']	二化他方菩薩，如經云「如來說兜率天十善報應，十方菩薩得首楞嚴三昧法門」。	二化他方菩薩，如經云「如來說兜率天十善報應，十方菩薩得首楞嚴三昧法門」。	001	Second, for bodhisattvas in other realms, as the sutra says, The Tathagata speaks of the rewards of the ten wholesome deeds in the Tuṣita Heaven, and bodhisattvas in the ten directions attain the gate of the śūraṃgama samādhi.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c09_9']	後異生有三品。	後異生有三品。	001	The latter ordinary beings are of three grades.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c12_1']	謂上品修者，或修觀佛三昧、或懺眾罪，□於□身得見彌勒，□□優劣、見形大小，廣如《方等陀羅尼經》及《上生經》說。	謂上品修者，或修觀佛三昧、或懺眾罪，□於□身得見彌勒，□□優劣、見形大小，廣如《方等陀羅尼經》及《上生經》說。	001	That is to say, those of the highest grade, either cultivating the samādhi of contemplating the Buddha or repenting of various offenses, will see Maitreya in their present bodies, seeing his superior and inferior forms, large and small, as extensively explained in the Vaipulya Dhāraṇī Sūtra and the Sūtra on Rebirth Above.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c14_6']	中品修者，或修觀佛三昧、或修淨業，捨身之後生於彼天，始□彌勒至不退轉，亦如《上生經》說。	中品修者，或修觀佛三昧、或修淨業，捨身之後生於彼天，始□彌勒至不退轉，亦如《上生經》說。	001	Those of the middle grade, either cultivating the samādhi of contemplating the Buddha or cultivating pure karma, will be reborn in that heaven after leaving this body, and will only attain irreversibility when Maitreya arrives, also as explained in the Sūtra on Rebirth Above.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c15_6']	下品修者，修施戒等種□□，發弘誓願□□彌勒。	下品修者，修施戒等種□□，發弘誓願□□彌勒。	001	Those of lower grade practice giving, precepts, and so forth, plant various good roots, make great vows, and follow Maitreya.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c17_10']	捨此身後隨業受生，乃至彌勒成道時，得值彌勒，三會蒙度，是即如《下生》、《成佛》二經說。	捨此身後隨業受生，乃至彌勒成道時，得值彌勒，三會蒙度，是即如《下生》、《成佛》二經說。	001	After abandoning this body, they are reborn according to their karma, and when Maitreya attains Buddhahood, they will meet Maitreya, be liberated in the three assemblies, which is just as the two sutras on the lower and upper births and becoming a Buddha explain.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c18_5']	有說《上生經》為化中品，餘二經為化下品。	有說《上生經》為化中品，餘二經為化下品。	001	Some say that the Sutra of the Upper Birth is for transforming those of middling grade, and the other two sutras are for transforming those of lower grade.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c18_19']	其上品者，正是方等經所被機。	其上品者，正是方等經所被機。	001	Those of the upper grade are precisely the faculties that are reached by the Vaipulya sutras.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c21_12']	上□上生經□□上中二品，若科為上品而不為上品，□□便違《上生經》，□云「命終時彌勒放大人相光迎此人」故。	上□上生經□□上中二品，若科為上品而不為上品，□□便違《上生經》，□云「命終時彌勒放大人相光迎此人」故。	001	The upper and upper birth sutra is for the upper and middling two grades. If classified as the upper grade but not being the upper grade, it would then contradict the Sutra of the Upper Birth, which says, When their life ends, Maitreya emits the light of the major marks to welcome this person.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c21_18']	故初□為勝。	故初□為勝。	001	Therefore, the first classification is superior.

['ZH_T38_1774_001:0303c23_7']	身既不殊，何須如來別說三經？	身既不殊，何須如來別說三經？	001	Since the body is not distinct, why does the Tathagata need to separately explain the three sutras?

['ZH_T38_1774_001:0304c25_16']	餘二經皆小乘攝，謂《下生經》從《增一》出，《成佛經》從《長阿含》出，文義淺薄、得小果故。	餘二經皆小乘攝，謂《下生經》從《增一》出，《成佛經》從《長阿含》出，文義淺薄、得小果故。	001	The other two sutras are both included in the Hinayana, namely the Sutra of Rebirth in the Lower Realms comes from the Ekottara Agama, and the Sutra of Attaining Buddhahood comes from the Dīgha Nikāya, because the text and meaning are shallow and one attains the fruit of the Hinayana.

The Sūtra on Rebirth Above says that first it was for Bhadrapāla, Mañjuśrī, and others, and also attained the practice of irreversibility always expounded in the six periods, because five hundred koṭīs of heavenly beings did not regress from supreme enlightenment.

The teaching's recipients are precisely the causes and conditions for the teaching's arising.
['ZH_T38_1774_001:0306a01_9']	次聖教所說分，謂正顯聖教所說法門品類差別故。	次聖教所說分，謂正顯聖教所說法門品類差別故。	001	Next is the section on what is spoken in the holy teaching, which refers to clearly revealing the categories and distinctions of the Dharma gates spoken in the holy teaching.

It is only because the Buddha Land Sūtra, in the place where it reveals the teaching, immediately explains the capacity of those to be influenced that it makes this statement.

['ZH_T38_1774_001:0306b23_6']	二唯識時，謂說聽徒心識上反作三世時。	二唯識時，謂說聽徒心識上反作三世時。	001	The second is the meaning of consciousness-only time, referring to the time when the minds of the assembly of speakers and listeners create the three times in reverse.
