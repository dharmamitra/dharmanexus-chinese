['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c06_16']	自知一乘、為得說《法華》方乃知耶？	自知一乘、為得說《法華》方乃知耶？	The treatise discusses whether arhats know the One Vehicle or do not know the One Vehicle. The question is: If one attains the intention of an arhat, does one then know the One Vehicle by oneself, or does one know it only after attaining the teaching of the Lotus Sūtra?
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c07_11']	又〈方便品〉以簡真偽章二文相違。	又〈方便品〉以簡真偽章二文相違。	Moreover, the chapter on distinguishing the genuine and the false in the chapter on skillful means contradicts the two texts.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c08_9']	初云「若實得羅漢，不信此法，無有是處。	初云「若實得羅漢，不信此法，無有是處。	The first says, If one truly attains arhatship, it is impossible not to believe this teaching.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c09_4']	若不信，此增上慢人，非阿羅漢。	若不信，此增上慢人，非阿羅漢。	If one does not believe it, one is a person of increased arrogance, not an arhat.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c09_14']	」此明羅漢必信一乘。	」此明羅漢必信一乘。	This clarifies that an arhat must believe in the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c10_7']	次文云「除佛滅後，現前無佛。	次文云「除佛滅後，現前無佛。	The next text says, Except after the Buddha's extinction, when there is no Buddha present.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c11_1']	」明佛滅後，羅漢亦有不信一乘。	」明佛滅後，羅漢亦有不信一乘。	It clarifies that even after the Buddha's extinction, arhats may still not believe in the One Vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c13_19']	一切得道並知得歸常住。	一切得道並知得歸常住。	All who attain the Way know that they return to the eternal abode.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c14_18']	若知同歸常住，皆是菩薩，無有二乘成聖。	若知同歸常住，皆是菩薩，無有二乘成聖。	If they know that they all return to the eternal abode, then they are all bodhisattvas, and there are no two vehicles that attain sagehood.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c16_2']	故《大經》云「不知常住尚不得二乘菩提說後無上道」。	故《大經》云「不知常住尚不得二乘菩提說後無上道」。	Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, If one does not know the eternal abode, one cannot attain the enlightenment of the two vehicles, let alone the unsurpassed way in the future.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c16_19']	若爾，前章明羅漢，此名據權行之人；	若爾，前章明羅漢，此名據權行之人；	If that is so, then the previous chapter clarifies that arhats are named based on those who practice expedient means;
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c18_2']	後明不信者，此據六心之前有實行聲聞，故不信了。	後明不信者，此據六心之前有實行聲聞，故不信了。	the later clarification of those who do not believe is based on those who actually practice as śrāvakas before the sixth ground, and thus do not believe in understanding.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c20_18']	一切道要得會空，不必須知同歸常住，故亦有知者亦有不知者，利根則知、鈍根不知，前文據知者、後文據不知。	一切道要得會空，不必須知同歸常住，故亦有知者亦有不知者，利根則知、鈍根不知，前文據知者、後文據不知。	All paths must attain emptiness, but it is not necessarily the case that they must know that they return to the eternal abode. Therefore, there are those who know and those who do not know. Those with sharp faculties know, while those with dull faculties do not know. The previous text is based on those who know, while the later text is based on those who do not know.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c22_13']	前說就理為論，三乘初業不愚於法故，凡是羅漢皆知同歸，聞經則信。	前說就理為論，三乘初業不愚於法故，凡是羅漢皆知同歸，聞經則信。	The previous explanation is based on principle, because those who are beginners in the three vehicles are not ignorant of the Dharma. Therefore, all arhats know that they return to the same, and if they hear the sūtra, they will believe it.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c23_16']	後就教中為論，羅漢稟小乘教成聖，不知同歸。	後就教中為論，羅漢稟小乘教成聖，不知同歸。	Later, in the teaching, arhats who follow the teachings of the Lesser Vehicle attain sagehood, but do not know about the same return.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c24_18']	例如《大經》云「十住菩薩，如來不說，不知佛性。	例如《大經》云「十住菩薩，如來不說，不知佛性。	It is similar to what the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: The Tathāgata does not speak of the bodhisattvas of the ten abodes, and they do not know the Buddha-nature.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c25_2']	」今亦然也。	」今亦然也。	Now it is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c25_6']	有人言：	有人言：	Some people say:
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c26_5']	是真羅漢則知，後據末世凡夫，故是不知耳。	是真羅漢則知，後據末世凡夫，故是不知耳。	If they are true arhats, then they know. Later, it is based on ordinary people in the latter age, so they are said to not know.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c27_12']	所以然者，凡夫具足三毒，聞經尚信，況末世羅漢而不信耶？	所以然者，凡夫具足三毒，聞經尚信，況末世羅漢而不信耶？	The reason for this is that ordinary people are fully endowed with the three poisons, and still believe the sūtra when they hear it, let alone arhats in the latter age who would not believe it?
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c27_16']	有人言：	有人言：	Some people say:
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0405c29_14']	此為時座，今其專聽速決疑心，若不信受則抱疑永世，以傳後佛來令促乘可以決言。	此為時座，今其專聽速決疑心，若不信受則抱疑永世，以傳後佛來令促乘可以決言。	This is for the sake of the assembly at that time, who are now listening intently and quickly resolving their doubts. If they do not believe and accept it, then they will hold doubts for a long time, and transmit it to future Buddhas, urging them to resolve it with words.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a01_13']	蓋是一經之大宗，不可存於異釋。	蓋是一經之大宗，不可存於異釋。	This is the great purport of the sūtra, and should not be left to different interpretations.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a02_16']	然眾師厝意不同，皆言二文相違，故異釋紛綸耳。	然眾師厝意不同，皆言二文相違，故異釋紛綸耳。	However, the various masters have different ideas, all saying that the two passages contradict each other, so the different interpretations are confused.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a03_5']	今明二文不相違也。	今明二文不相違也。	Now, I will clarify that the two texts are not contradictory.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a03_18']	前明是真羅漢者，聞經必信。	前明是真羅漢者，聞經必信。	The previous explanation states that true arhats, upon hearing the sutra, will definitely have faith.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a04_11']	若聞經不信者，此非羅漢也。	若聞經不信者，此非羅漢也。	If they hear the sutra and do not have faith, they are not arhats.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a05_18']	後文佛更簡之，若真羅漢聞經必信，頗有羅漢不信一乘以不？	後文佛更簡之，若真羅漢聞經必信，頗有羅漢不信一乘以不？	In the later text, the Buddha further distinguishes them, saying that if true arhats hear the sutra, they will definitely have faith. Is there any arhat who does not believe in the One Vehicle?
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a08_8']	是故釋云亦有此義，即佛滅度後，現前無佛復無傳經之人及所傳之法，闕此三義則羅漢亦有不信義也。	是故釋云亦有此義，即佛滅度後，現前無佛復無傳經之人及所傳之法，闕此三義則羅漢亦有不信義也。	Therefore, the explanation states that there is also this meaning. That is to say, after the Buddha's nirvana, there is no Buddha present, nor is there anyone transmitting the sutra or the Dharma that is transmitted. If these three meanings are lacking, then there is also the meaning that arhats may not have faith.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a09_15']	若佛雖滅度，有傳經人及所傳之法，羅漢聞之則便信受也。	若佛雖滅度，有傳經人及所傳之法，羅漢聞之則便信受也。	If the Buddha has already entered nirvana, but there are people transmitting the sutra and the Dharma that is transmitted, then the arhats will have faith upon hearing it.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a13_14']	晚見《法華論》亦不明二文相違。	晚見《法華論》亦不明二文相違。	Later, I saw the Fahua Lun, which also does not clarify the contradiction between the two passages.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a15_18']	除佛滅後現前無佛者，論明云何如來不成不堪說法人，為斷此疑，如經除佛滅度後現前無佛故也。	除佛滅後現前無佛者，論明云何如來不成不堪說法人，為斷此疑，如經除佛滅度後現前無佛故也。	Excluding after the Buddha's extinction when there is no Buddha present, the treatise clarifies how the Tathāgata does not become one who is incapable of expounding the Dharma. To cut off this doubt, it says in the sūtra, Except after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa when there is no Buddha present.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a17_8']	論意明如來在世說一乘，必然令羅漢信受，故不成不堪說法人。	論意明如來在世說一乘，必然令羅漢信受，故不成不堪說法人。	The meaning of the treatise clarifies that when the Tathāgata is in the world expounding the One Vehicle, it is certain to make the arhats believe and accept it, and therefore he does not become one who is incapable of expounding the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406a18_7']	明除佛滅後無復佛者，則有羅漢不信耳。	明除佛滅後無復佛者，則有羅漢不信耳。	It clarifies that after the Buddha's extinction when there is no Buddha, then there are arhats who do not believe.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406b01_7']	故知二乘不聞《法華》不知同歸也。	故知二乘不聞《法華》不知同歸也。	Therefore, we know that the two vehicles do not hear the Lotus Sūtra and do not know about the common return.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0406b02_11']	又二乘自知作佛者，何得云為諸聲聞說《妙法華經》？	又二乘自知作佛者，何得云為諸聲聞說《妙法華經》？	Moreover, if the two vehicles themselves knew they would become Buddhas, how could it be said that the Wonderful Dharma Flower Sutra was spoken for the sake of the śrāvakas?

Seeking the carriage can be likened to I see the Buddha's disciples, etc., giving rise to the great capacity. Bestowing the carriage can be likened to among the bodhisattvas, being straightforward and abandoning skillful means, only speaking of the unsurpassed path. Joyfully obtaining the carriage can be likened to the bodhisattvas hearing this teaching, all their nets of doubt are already removed, and the 1,200 arhats will also become buddhas.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a02_3']	三者還譬上〈方便品〉三事，索車擬三請中大眾執動疑生也，賜車擬佛詶請廣說也，得車歡喜擬身子領解也。	三者還譬上〈方便品〉三事，索車擬三請中大眾執動疑生也，賜車擬佛詶請廣說也，得車歡喜擬身子領解也。	Third, it corresponds to the three matters in the chapter on Skillful Means above; the request for the carriage corresponds to the arising of doubts due to the agitation of the great assembly in the three requests; the bestowal of the carriage corresponds to the Buddha's response to the request for extensive explanation; and the joy of obtaining the carriage corresponds to Śāriputra's understanding.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a04_6']	三請中通明大眾皆疑悔，非獨身子，故得擬之。	三請中通明大眾皆疑悔，非獨身子，故得擬之。	In the three requests, it is generally clarified that the great assembly all had doubts and regrets, not just Śāriputra, so it can correspond to them.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a08_9']	次別序索車大意者，上一乘化不得，故虛指門外明有三車，引出諸子。	次別序索車大意者，上一乘化不得，故虛指門外明有三車，引出諸子。	Next, the general meaning of the separate preface requesting the vehicles is that since the teaching of the One Vehicle was not received, the three vehicles were provisionally indicated outside the gate to lead the children out.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a10_2']	諸子並承權出宅，有智之者不執父言，懸領父意知權有實無則無所索；	諸子並承權出宅，有智之者不執父言，懸領父意知權有實無則無所索；	All the children, by following the provisional, left the house. Those with wisdom did not cling to the father's words, but distantly understood the father's intention, knowing that the provisional has reality and is not nonexistent, so they did not request anything;
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a11_7']	無智之子執父之言不領父意，未鑒權有實無是故有索。	無智之子執父之言不領父意，未鑒權有實無是故有索。	The children without wisdom clung to the father's words and did not understand the father's intention. They were not yet aware that the provisional has reality and is not nonexistent, so they had requests.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a14_7']	佛以此喻令執三之徒因此而改，未信一乘藉斯而信，故前身子請云「善哉世尊願為四眾說其因緣」，今說索譬即說因緣詶其請也。	佛以此喻令執三之徒因此而改，未信一乘藉斯而信，故前身子請云「善哉世尊願為四眾說其因緣」，今說索譬即說因緣詶其請也。	The Buddha used this analogy to make those who cling to the three change based on this, and those who have not yet believed in the One Vehicle to believe based on this. Therefore, Shariputra's request earlier was, Excellent, World-Honored One! Please explain the causes and conditions for the four assemblies. Now explaining the analogy of requesting is explaining the causes and conditions to respond to his request.

This is why they requested [three].

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a21_15']	一者本以三車譬於三果，故云今此三車皆在門外。	一者本以三車譬於三果，故云今此三車皆在門外。	First, the three carriages are originally used as a metaphor for the three fruits, so it is said, Now these three carriages are all outside the gate.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a22_17']	二乘人出門外至許車處，覓果不得，可言索果；	二乘人出門外至許車處，覓果不得，可言索果；	The two vehicles leave the gate and reach the place where the carriages are allowed, but they cannot find the fruits, so it can be said that they request the fruits;
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a24_1']	菩薩之人未至許車處，覓佛果不得，何有索佛果耶？	菩薩之人未至許車處，覓佛果不得，何有索佛果耶？	The bodhisattvas have not yet reached the place where the carriages are allowed, and cannot find the Buddha's fruit, so how could there be requesting the Buddha's fruit?
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a26_2']	二者設云六地菩薩出三界外乃不索佛果，亦同二乘索盡無生智，故菩薩三人亦有索者。	二者設云六地菩薩出三界外乃不索佛果，亦同二乘索盡無生智，故菩薩三人亦有索者。	Second, if it is said that the bodhisattvas of the sixth ground leave the three realms and do not request the Buddha's fruit, it is also the same as the two vehicles requesting the knowledge of extinction and non-arising, so the three people of the bodhisattvas also have those who request [the Buddha's fruit].
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a26_17']	是義不然，尋大小乘經無菩薩索。	是義不然，尋大小乘經無菩薩索。	This meaning is not so. Searching through the Mahayana and Hinayana sutras, there is no bodhisattva seeking.
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a27_6']	小乘中明二種菩薩：	小乘中明二種菩薩：	In the Hinayana, two kinds of bodhisattvas are explained:

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408a29_12']	故《彌勒觀經》優婆離白佛：	故《彌勒觀經》優婆離白佛：	Therefore, in the Sutra of Maitreya's Contemplation, Upāli addressed the Buddha, saying:
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408b01_8']	「是阿逸多未斷三毒，命終當生何處？	「是阿逸多未斷三毒，命終當生何處？	This Ajita has not yet severed the three poisons. Where will he be reborn after his life ends?
['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408b02_7']	」故知始行終心皆是凡夫，不得出門外索也。	」故知始行終心皆是凡夫，不得出門外索也。	Therefore, it is known that from the initial practice to the final mind, all are ordinary beings, and they cannot go outside the door to seek.

['ZH_T34_1720_006:0408b05_10']	三十四心是佛，三十三心是菩薩，而見諦已傾思惟未盡、此時未出三界，故無索；	三十四心是佛，三十三心是菩薩，而見諦已傾思惟未盡、此時未出三界，故無索；	In the thirty-fourth mental state, he became a Buddha.
