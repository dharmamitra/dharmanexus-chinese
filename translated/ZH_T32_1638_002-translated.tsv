['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b23_12']	此之四相剎那剎那有所轉故，不相應相而無其實。	此之四相剎那剎那有所轉故，不相應相而無其實。	002	These four characteristics are constantly changing from moment to moment, so they are not real characteristics that are not associated [with mind].
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b25_11']	於不相應無實相中，不可起二分別，不可說一時、不可說異時，一時、異時無生起故。	於不相應無實相中，不可起二分別，不可說一時、不可說異時，一時、異時無生起故。	002	Within the unreal characteristics that are not associated, two kinds of discrimination cannot arise. They cannot be said to be simultaneous or different, because there is no arising either simultaneously or at different times.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b26_2']	又不可說無時，理相違故。	又不可說無時，理相違故。	002	Moreover, they cannot be said to be without time, because that contradicts reason.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b26_13']	若說壞時，壞即不生故。	若說壞時，壞即不生故。	002	If it is said that they cease at the time of cessation, then cessation itself does not arise.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b27_11']	是故當知生時無住，住時亦復而無所得。	是故當知生時無住，住時亦復而無所得。	002	Therefore, you should know that at the time of arising there is no abiding, and at the time of abiding there is also nothing to be attained.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b28_1']	彼無住性，云何有滅？	彼無住性，云何有滅？	002	How can that which has no abiding nature have cessation?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b28_10']	彼生與住說名為異。	彼生與住說名為異。	002	Arising and abiding are called changing.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b28_20']	若本無生，云何有住？	若本無生，云何有住？	002	If there is originally no arising, how can there be abiding?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b29_9']	若法無住，即云何得？	若法無住，即云何得？	002	If a dharma has no abiding, how can it be obtained?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152b29_18']	以無生故及無住故。	以無生故及無住故。	002	Because it is unborn and has no abiding.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c01_7']	於何義中而說有滅？	於何義中而說有滅？	002	In what meaning is it said to have cessation?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c02_2']	若法有住，於住法中可說異性；	若法有住，於住法中可說異性；	002	If a dharma has abiding, in an abiding dharma one can speak of a different nature;
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c02_12']	法既無住，何有異性？	法既無住，何有異性？	002	since the dharma has no abiding, how can there be a different nature?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c03_1']	無異性中不應分別。	無異性中不應分別。	002	In a nature that is not different, one should not discriminate.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c03_19']	當知異性而非住性，實無一性而可分別。	當知異性而非住性，實無一性而可分別。	002	One should know that a different nature is not an abiding nature, and in reality there is no single nature that can be discriminated.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c05_3']	是故諸相及分別心，此為二種，若無諸相即無分別。	是故諸相及分別心，此為二種，若無諸相即無分別。	002	Therefore, the characteristics and the discriminating mind are these two kinds. If there are no characteristics, then there is no discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c06_2']	若彼諸相、若分別心有分別者，二俱分別。	若彼諸相、若分別心有分別者，二俱分別。	002	If those characteristics and the discriminating mind are discriminated, both are discriminated.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c06_13']	如實義者，無相無分別。	如實義者，無相無分別。	002	In the true meaning, there are no characteristics and no discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c08_3']	生住異滅若有性者，於一切時、一切處、一切法初中後分不可安立。	生住異滅若有性者，於一切時、一切處、一切法初中後分不可安立。	002	If birth, abiding, change, and cessation have a nature, then at all times, in all places, and in all dharmas, the initial, middle, and final parts cannot be established.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c09_3']	若能如是如理思惟者，佛說是人名為大智。	若能如是如理思惟者，佛說是人名為大智。	002	If one is able to contemplate in this way according to the principle, the Buddha says that such a person is called greatly wise.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c11_8']	初分中分後分諸性，於三分性中實無一性有所生起，是故諸法非一性、非多性、一多中間俱無所得。	初分中分後分諸性，於三分性中實無一性有所生起，是故諸法非一性、非多性、一多中間俱無所得。	002	In the first, middle, and latter parts, there is no real nature that arises in the three natures. Therefore, dharmas are neither a single nature nor multiple natures, and neither one nor many can be attained in between.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c13_11']	若一切法離一性、離多性，即常與無常無所分別，是故非無常、非非無常，不應於中起二分別。	若一切法離一性、離多性，即常與無常無所分別，是故非無常、非非無常，不應於中起二分別。	002	If all dharmas are apart from a single nature and apart from multiple natures, then permanence and impermanence are not distinguished. Therefore, they are neither impermanent nor not impermanent, and one should not give rise to two discriminations within them.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c15_1']	當知初分中分後分不俱時生、不俱時有，如他人性即自所無。	當知初分中分後分不俱時生、不俱時有，如他人性即自所無。	002	One should know that the first, middle, and latter parts do not arise or exist simultaneously, just like the nature of another person is not one's own.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c15_11']	若自體性，他云何有？	若自體性，他云何有？	002	If one's own nature exists, how can another exist?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c16_4']	此中所說自性尚無，他性何有？	此中所說自性尚無，他性何有？	002	Here, one's own nature is said to be non-existent, so how can another nature exist?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c17_10']	是故自亦無性、他亦無性，當知一切法所行所作不離因性。	是故自亦無性、他亦無性，當知一切法所行所作不離因性。	002	Therefore, one's own nature is also non-existent, and another's nature is also non-existent. One should know that all dharmas that are practiced and produced are not apart from the nature of causes.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c19_18']	若壞不壞，非心所思、不可分別，初中後分如實思惟，皆無為相、無別異相，不應分別彼彼諸法、各各種子。	若壞不壞，非心所思、不可分別，初中後分如實思惟，皆無為相、無別異相，不應分別彼彼諸法、各各種子。	002	Whether destroyed or not destroyed, it is not what the mind thinks, and cannot be discriminated. In the initial, middle, and final stages, if one truly contemplates, they are all the characteristics of the unconditioned, without the characteristics of differentiation. One should not discriminate the seeds of each and every dharma.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c21_11']	彼各各性，一一不離智種子生，剎那剎那時分轉易，是故彼彼一切法性。	彼各各性，一一不離智種子生，剎那剎那時分轉易，是故彼彼一切法性。	002	Each and every nature arises from the seeds of wisdom, one by one, and changes moment by moment. Therefore, the nature of each and every dharma
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c22_1']	云何心能思惟生起？	云何心能思惟生起？	002	How can the mind give rise to thought?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c23_18']	一切法中差別事相，當知無因亦無差別，諸法本來無所造作，雖作用相續當何有實？	一切法中差別事相，當知無因亦無差別，諸法本來無所造作，雖作用相續當何有實？	002	In all dharmas, the characteristics of differentiated phenomena should be known to be without cause and without differentiation. Originally, dharmas are not created. Although the characteristics of function continue, how can they be real?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c25_3']	是故所知諸法及能知者，是二於剎那中不能和合。	是故所知諸法及能知者，是二於剎那中不能和合。	002	Therefore, the known dharmas and the knower, these two cannot unite in a moment.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c26_3']	彼如是性實無能取，是中無所有亦無所得。	彼如是性實無能取，是中無所有亦無所得。	002	That such a nature is truly ungraspable, in this there is nothing and also nothing to attain.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c27_11']	當觀諸法生已即壞，若法不壞即非生法，以法壞故而無所得。	當觀諸法生已即壞，若法不壞即非生法，以法壞故而無所得。	002	One should contemplate that all phenomena arise and then perish. If a phenomenon does not perish, it is not a born phenomenon. Because phenomena perish, there is nothing to be attained.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0152c28_19']	彼不壞者是常住性，即常住性彼亦復離，即離之言是中亦離。	彼不壞者是常住性，即常住性彼亦復離，即離之言是中亦離。	002	That which does not perish is the nature of permanence, and that very nature of permanence is also apart from. The words apart from are also apart from in this context.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a01_7']	若如是知，即了諸法彼差別性是常住因，無差別性亦復如是。	若如是知，即了諸法彼差別性是常住因，無差別性亦復如是。	002	If one understands in this way, one will understand that the differentiated nature of all phenomena is the cause of permanence, and the undifferentiated nature is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a02_2']	諸有為法即生即滅，故名無住。	諸有為法即生即滅，故名無住。	002	All conditioned phenomena are born and extinguished, and therefore they are called non-abiding.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a02_12']	若有住者，應有所得。	若有住者，應有所得。	002	If there is abiding, there should be something to be attained.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a03_18']	以無住相、無所得故，彼無住法是故相應一切行中諸差別行。	以無住相、無所得故，彼無住法是故相應一切行中諸差別行。	002	Because of the characteristic of non-abiding and the lack of attainment, that non-abiding dharma is therefore in accord with all the differentiated practices.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a04_18']	若彼彼性有所得者，於無差別行云何對治？	若彼彼性有所得者，於無差別行云何對治？	002	If there is something to be attained in each and every nature, how does one counteract the undifferentiated practices?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a05_10']	是故差別行中無性可生。	是故差別行中無性可生。	002	Therefore, in the differentiated practices, there is no nature that can be born.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a07_3']	復次當知眼等諸識有現量性，大牟尼師親所宣說。	復次當知眼等諸識有現量性，大牟尼師親所宣說。	002	Furthermore, one should know that the various consciousnesses such as the eye consciousness have the nature of direct perception, as personally proclaimed by the Great Sage.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a08_5']	若離現量性別取量非量者，彼於此中當云何得？	若離現量性別取量非量者，彼於此中當云何得？	002	If apart from the distinct valid cognition of direct perception, there is a separate valid cognition or invalid cognition, how can they be obtained in this case?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a09_8']	世間所有先所作事皆無所依，如諸所作無作用性。	世間所有先所作事皆無所依，如諸所作無作用性。	002	All the previously performed activities in the world are without support, just like all activities that lack the nature of function.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a10_7']	若彼如是，諸現前事如其現前亦無所成。	若彼如是，諸現前事如其現前亦無所成。	002	If they are like this, then all the present activities, just as they are present, are also without accomplishment.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a11_8']	是中若有所行及非所行，即諸作用義皆相違。	是中若有所行及非所行，即諸作用義皆相違。	002	In this case, if there is something to be practiced or not to be practiced, then the meaning of all functions is mutually contradictory.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a12_12']	是故一切無實作事皆如虛空，常與無常俱不可執。	是故一切無實作事皆如虛空，常與無常俱不可執。	002	Therefore, all real activities are like empty space, and permanence and impermanence are both ungraspable.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a14_10']	當知諸法皆從緣生，雖生亦無少法可得，緣如幻故所生如幻，即彼如是出生諸法。	當知諸法皆從緣生，雖生亦無少法可得，緣如幻故所生如幻，即彼如是出生諸法。	002	One should know that all dharmas arise from conditions. Although they arise, no dharma can be obtained, because the conditions are like illusions, and what arises is also like an illusion. It is those illusions that give rise to all dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a15_4']	以是義故，諸法無性亦非無性。	以是義故，諸法無性亦非無性。	002	For this reason, all dharmas are without nature and also not without nature.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a15_18']	此如是義，正等正覺如實宣說。	此如是義，正等正覺如實宣說。	002	This meaning is correctly and equally proclaimed by the Perfectly Enlightened One as it truly is.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a16_17']	當知一切法無著無礙，於大乘中此真實說。	當知一切法無著無礙，於大乘中此真實說。	002	One should know that all dharmas are without attachment and obstruction. This is the true teaching within the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a17_12']	如是了知，即菩提心本來平等。	如是了知，即菩提心本來平等。	002	Understanding this is the originally equal mind of enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a21_3']	十方三世一切如來如實知故，出生方便宣說一切甚深法門，如其所應名言分別，是故各各宣說表示出生諸法，所謂彼彼法是四諦法、彼彼法是唯識法。	十方三世一切如來如實知故，出生方便宣說一切甚深法門，如其所應名言分別，是故各各宣說表示出生諸法，所謂彼彼法是四諦法、彼彼法是唯識法。	002	Because the tathāgatas of the ten directions and three times know this as it truly is, they give rise to skillful means and proclaim all the profound Dharma gates, distinguishing them with names and words as appropriate. Therefore, each one proclaims and reveals the arising of all dharmas, saying that such and such dharmas are the Dharma of the four truths, and such and such dharmas are the Dharma of consciousness only.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a23_5']	雖有所說而常真實，彼彼諸法皆悉如幻，由如幻故不可尋、不可伺、不可知、無表示、無攝藏。	雖有所說而常真實，彼彼諸法皆悉如幻，由如幻故不可尋、不可伺、不可知、無表示、無攝藏。	002	Although there are teachings, they are always true. All those dharmas are like illusions. Because they are like illusions, they cannot be sought, cannot be observed, cannot be known, cannot be indicated, and cannot be concealed.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a24_10']	若離如是等，即知法真實，以知真實故而菩提心速得解脫。	若離如是等，即知法真實，以知真實故而菩提心速得解脫。	002	If one departs from this and so forth, one will then know the truth of dharmas. Because of knowing the truth, the mind of enlightenment will quickly attain liberation.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a26_7']	若菩提心如是解脫，即諸佛亦然、眾生亦然、生死亦然、涅盤亦然、法界亦然。	若菩提心如是解脫，即諸佛亦然、眾生亦然、生死亦然、涅盤亦然、法界亦然。	002	If the mind of enlightenment is liberated like this, then the buddhas are also thus, sentient beings are also thus, birth and death are also thus, nirvāṇa is also thus, and the Dharma realm is also thus.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a27_7']	是故佛與眾生二俱平等，生死涅盤亦復平等。	是故佛與眾生二俱平等，生死涅盤亦復平等。	002	Therefore, the Buddha and sentient beings are both equally equal, and birth and death and nirvana are also equally equal.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153a29_5']	若於此中如是如實了知是義，佛說此為諸佛菩提，乃於一切所行所作悉能成辦。	若於此中如是如實了知是義，佛說此為諸佛菩提，乃於一切所行所作悉能成辦。	002	If one can understand this meaning in this way, the Buddha says that this is the enlightenment of the buddhas, and one will be able to accomplish all practices and activities.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b01_4']	此所說義是第一義，離此無別有第一義。	此所說義是第一義，離此無別有第一義。	002	The meaning explained here is the ultimate truth, apart from this there is no separate ultimate truth.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b05_4']	此第一義攝一切法，是不思議真實語行，離有離無、非智非愚、非少非多，無相無性、無所照達、智不可知、識不可識，不即自性不離自性、無取無捨離取捨相，從如實智之所出生。	此第一義攝一切法，是不思議真實語行，離有離無、非智非愚、非少非多，無相無性、無所照達、智不可知、識不可識，不即自性不離自性、無取無捨離取捨相，從如實智之所出生。	002	This ultimate truth includes all dharmas, it is the inconceivable true language practice, apart from existence and apart from nonexistence, neither wisdom nor foolishness, neither few nor many, without characteristics and without nature, nothing to illuminate or understand, wisdom cannot know it, consciousness cannot cognize it, not identical to one's own nature and not apart from one's own nature, without grasping and without abandoning, apart from the characteristics of grasping and abandoning, born from the wisdom of suchness.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b06_11']	隨所出生、隨所言說，無取相、無攝藏，非心所思，不可知故；	隨所出生、隨所言說，無取相、無攝藏，非心所思，不可知故；	002	According to what is born and according to what is spoken, without grasping characteristics and without concealment, not what is thought by the mind, because it cannot be known;
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b07_1']	非眼所見，不可見故。	非眼所見，不可見故。	002	not seen by the eyes, because it cannot be seen.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b07_5']	何以故？	何以故？	002	Why is this?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b07_11']	心無自性故。	心無自性故。	002	Because the mind has no inherent nature.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b10_12']	由心無自性，即一切法無自無他，以無自他二種差別即一切法自性相應，無生無滅、無集無散、非智非愚，無有少法有所表示、有所照達。	由心無自性，即一切法無自無他，以無自他二種差別即一切法自性相應，無生無滅、無集無散、非智非愚，無有少法有所表示、有所照達。	002	Since the mind has no inherent nature, all dharmas have no self and no other. Since there is no self and other duality, the inherent nature of all dharmas is in accord, unborn, unceasing, neither accumulating nor dispersing, neither wisdom nor folly. There is not even a little dharma that can be indicated or illuminated.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b11_11']	當知彼彼菩提種子而彼彼相，為表了故。	當知彼彼菩提種子而彼彼相，為表了故。	002	One should know that those various characteristics of the seeds of enlightenment are for the sake of indication.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b12_12']	若能於彼彼相觀無我者，菩提種子亦無所生。	若能於彼彼相觀無我者，菩提種子亦無所生。	002	If one can observe the absence of self in those various characteristics, then the seeds of enlightenment will also not arise.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b14_16']	諸菩薩摩訶薩自性真實，以善方便出現世間，起大悲心示有所證，而諸菩薩自性真實無生無滅。	諸菩薩摩訶薩自性真實，以善方便出現世間，起大悲心示有所證，而諸菩薩自性真實無生無滅。	002	The true nature of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, by skillful means, appears in the world, gives rise to a mind of great compassion, demonstrates attainment, and yet the true nature of bodhisattvas is unborn and unceasing.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b16_10']	當知識法遠離疑惑，無有少法而可生起，我我所空，而無有相顯了表示。	當知識法遠離疑惑，無有少法而可生起，我我所空，而無有相顯了表示。	002	One should know that the dharma of cognition is far removed from doubt, there is not even a little dharma that can arise, the self and what belongs to the self are empty, and there are no characteristics that can be clearly indicated.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b18_1']	識相光明而無自性，然光明性彼性自常，是故我相性者無有光明。	識相光明而無自性，然光明性彼性自常，是故我相性者無有光明。	002	The characteristics of consciousness are luminous, yet they are without intrinsic nature. However, the nature of luminosity is always their nature. Therefore, the characteristics of my nature are without luminosity.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b18_14']	無光明中云何可說有光明相？	無光明中云何可說有光明相？	002	How can one speak of the characteristics of luminosity in the absence of luminosity?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b19_13']	如諸光明而能破暗，然暗與明不近不合。	如諸光明而能破暗，然暗與明不近不合。	002	Just as luminosity can dispel darkness, yet darkness and light are not in contact or united.
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b20_2']	不近故明何能破？	不近故明何能破？	002	If they are not in contact, how can light dispel it?
['ZH_T32_1638_002:0153b20_10']	不合故暗何所破？	不合故暗何所破？	002	If they are not united, what is darkness that is dispelled?
