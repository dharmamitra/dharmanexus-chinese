['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c07_17']	9 九辯差別品第二之九已辯六因相別世定，必應對果建立因名。	9 九辯差別品第二之九已辯六因相別世定，必應對果建立因名。	Chapter 9, section 2: Distinguishing the Differences, part 9. The characteristics of the six causes have already been discussed. The world definitely establishes the name of cause in relation to the effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c08_7']	何等名為因所對果？	何等名為因所對果？	What are called the effects corresponding to the causes?

['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c09_13']	果有為離繫，　　無為無因果。	果有為離繫，　　無為無因果。	Unconditioned has no cause or effect.

['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c11_1']	果有五種，後當廣說，今且略標有為離繫。	果有五種，後當廣說，今且略標有為離繫。	There are five kinds of effects, which will be discussed in detail later. For now, they are briefly indicated as conditioned and unattached.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c11_6']	如本論說：	如本論說：	As the Abhidharma says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c11_11']	果法云何？	果法云何？	What are the dharmas of effect?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c12_1']	謂諸有為及與擇滅。	謂諸有為及與擇滅。	It means all conditioned dharmas and the cessation obtained through discrimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c12_14']	豈不擇滅許是果故必應有因？	豈不擇滅許是果故必應有因？	Isn't it that because cessation obtained through discrimination is accepted as an effect, it must have a cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c13_9']	非無有因可說為果，曾未見故。	非無有因可說為果，曾未見故。	It is not that without a cause it can be said to be an effect, because it has never been seen.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c14_7']	我亦許道為證得因，經說此為沙門果故。	我亦許道為證得因，經說此為沙門果故。	I also accept the path as the cause for its realization, because the sūtras say it is the effect of śramaṇas.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c14_17']	此六因內，從何因得？	此六因內，從何因得？	From which of these six causes is it obtained?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c15_15']	我說此果非從六因，前說六因生所賴故。	我說此果非從六因，前說六因生所賴故。	I say that this result is not from the six causes, because the six causes previously mentioned are what is relied upon for production.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c16_14']	若爾，應許此證得因，離前六因別為第七。	若爾，應許此證得因，離前六因別為第七。	If that is so, then you should admit that this realization is a cause, apart from the previous six causes, as a seventh.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c18_5']	我宗所許，如汝所言，豈不汝宗有如是誦，涅槃是果而無有因？	我宗所許，如汝所言，豈不汝宗有如是誦，涅槃是果而無有因？	The position accepted by our school is as you have stated. Isn't there such a recitation in your school that nirvana is a result but has no cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c18_15']	雖有此誦，於義無失。	雖有此誦，於義無失。	Although there is this recitation, there is no error in the meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c19_14']	謂諸世間，於設功用所欣事辦共立果名。	謂諸世間，於設功用所欣事辦共立果名。	That is to say, in the world, when one has accomplished what one desires through exertion, it is commonly called a result.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c20_14']	死於士夫極為衰惱，故於不死，士最所欣。	死於士夫極為衰惱，故於不死，士最所欣。	Death is the greatest calamity for a person, so non-death is what a person most desires.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c21_12']	如是所欣，由道功用所證得故，說名為果。	如是所欣，由道功用所證得故，說名為果。	This most desired [state] is attained through the exertion of the path, so it is called a result.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c22_10', 'ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c23_6']	言無因者，道於所得擇滅無為非六因故。🔽擇滅於道，非所生果，是所證果；	言無因者，道於所得擇滅無為非六因故。 擇滅於道，非所生果，是所證果；	As for saying it has no cause, the path is not one of the six causes in relation to the unconditioned cessation that is attained.🔽Cessation is not a result produced by the path, but a result realized by the path;
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c23_21']	道於擇滅，非能生因，是能證因。	道於擇滅，非能生因，是能證因。	the path is not a productive cause in relation to cessation, but a realizing cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c24_17']	故道與滅更互相對，因果是非不可定說。	故道與滅更互相對，因果是非不可定說。	Therefore, the path and cessation are mutually corresponding, and cause and effect and right and wrong cannot be definitively stated.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c25_16']	若道於滅為證得因，是則但應得為道果。	若道於滅為證得因，是則但應得為道果。	If the path is the cause of realizing cessation, then it should only be said to be the fruit of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c26_6']	誰言道果定非滅得？	誰言道果定非滅得？	Who says that the fruit of the path is definitely not the attainment of cessation?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0428c27_5']	道於滅得為同類因，或亦說為俱有因故。	道於滅得為同類因，或亦說為俱有因故。	Because the path is the homogeneous cause of the attainment of cessation, or it is also said to be the coexistent cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a01_2']	然此非聖正所求果，由諸聖者以所得滅蘊在心中修行聖道，故道勝果唯所得滅，非滅之得，以諸聖者非求有為而修聖道。	然此非聖正所求果，由諸聖者以所得滅蘊在心中修行聖道，故道勝果唯所得滅，非滅之得，以諸聖者非求有為而修聖道。	However, this is not the holy fruit that is truly sought, because the noble ones, with the cessation they have attained included in their minds, practice the holy path. Therefore, the superior fruit of the path is only the cessation that is attained, not the attainment of cessation, because the noble ones do not practice the holy path in order to seek conditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a02_7']	故薄伽梵於契經中說沙門果，唯斷非道，非唯為證道。	故薄伽梵於契經中說沙門果，唯斷非道，非唯為證道。	Therefore, the Bhagavān said in the sūtras that the fruits of the śramaṇa are only the severing of bonds, not the realization of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a03_5']	修道非無用，得初念道時，應所作已辦。	修道非無用，得初念道時，應所作已辦。	The path of cultivation is not without use, because when the first moment of the path is attained, what should be done has already been accomplished.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a04_4']	若許擇滅是能作因，應許涅槃有增上果。	若許擇滅是能作因，應許涅槃有增上果。	If you admit that cessation through discrimination is the efficient cause, you must admit that nirvāṇa has a dominant fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a05_3']	非許擇滅，眼等生時有能生用可如聲等。	非許擇滅，眼等生時有能生用可如聲等。	It is not that extinction obtained through contemplation is like sound, etc., in having a productive function when the eye, etc., are produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a06_11']	謂有為法正生位中，有為無為皆不為障，故一切法皆能作因。	謂有為法正生位中，有為無為皆不為障，故一切法皆能作因。	That is, when conditioned dharmas are in the state of being produced, neither conditioned nor unconditioned dharmas obstruct them, and therefore all dharmas can be causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a07_10']	然有為中唯過現法有取與用，說為有果。	然有為中唯過現法有取與用，說為有果。	However, only past and present dharmas among conditioned dharmas have the function of taking and giving, and are said to have results.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a08_10']	未來諸法及諸無為無如是用，故非有果。	未來諸法及諸無為無如是用，故非有果。	Future dharmas and unconditioned dharmas do not have this function, and therefore they do not have results.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a08_15']	故契經說：	故契經說：	Therefore a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a09_9']	諸因諸緣能生識者皆是無常。	諸因諸緣能生識者皆是無常。	All causes and conditions that produce consciousness are impermanent.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a10_11']	雖無為法是因是緣，而不能生，故佛不說。	雖無為法是因是緣，而不能生，故佛不說。	Although unconditioned dharmas are causes and conditions, they cannot produce, and therefore the Buddha did not say so.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a11_10']	如前思擇能作因中，說能作因略有二種：	如前思擇能作因中，說能作因略有二種：	As discussed previously in the consideration of the efficient cause, the efficient cause is briefly of two kinds:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a13_1']	一有生力、二唯無障，故無為法無障成因，由不能生故非有果。	一有生力、二唯無障，故無為法無障成因，由不能生故非有果。	one has the power to produce, and the other merely does not obstruct. Therefore unconditioned dharmas are causes that do not obstruct, but because they cannot produce, they do not have results.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a13_6']	豈不經說：	豈不經說：	Isn’t it the case that a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a13_15']	意法為緣生於意識。	意法為緣生於意識。	The mental consciousness is produced with mind and dharmas as conditions?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a14_9']	何故無為是法所攝而不能生？	何故無為是法所攝而不能生？	Why is unconditioned dharmas included in dharmas but unable to produce?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a15_8']	依多能生，密作是說，何妨少分有不能生。	依多能生，密作是說，何妨少分有不能生。	Based on the majority being able to produce, this is said in an implicit manner. How can it be prevented that a small part is unable to produce?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a16_13']	或復無為亦能生識，然識非果，如前說故、非能生故；	或復無為亦能生識，然識非果，如前說故、非能生故；	Or, unconditioned dharmas are also able to produce consciousness. However, consciousness is not a result, as explained before, because it is not able to produce.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a17_6']	便是無常，彼說能生後有識故。	便是無常，彼說能生後有識故。	If it is able to produce subsequent consciousness, it would be impermanent.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a19_6']	由如是理，如有為法建立因果，無為不然，是故擇滅是因無果、是果無因，理極成立。	由如是理，如有為法建立因果，無為不然，是故擇滅是因無果、是果無因，理極成立。	Due to this principle, conditioned dharmas establish cause and effect, but unconditioned dharmas do not. Therefore, cessation through discernment is cause without result, and is result without cause. The principle is extremely established.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a21_12']	此中多類誹謗涅槃，彼誹謗因紛競非一，我今正破經主謗因兼破餘師，成立擇滅，因茲亦辯餘二無為。	此中多類誹謗涅槃，彼誹謗因紛競非一，我今正破經主謗因兼破餘師，成立擇滅，因茲亦辯餘二無為。	Here, there are many types that slander nirvāṇa. The causes for their slander are not uniform. I will now refute the master of the treatise's causes for slander and also refute other teachers, establishing cessation through discernment. Due to this, I will also discuss the other two unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a23_6']	此中經主引經部說，一切無為皆非實有，如色受等別有實物，此所無故。	此中經主引經部說，一切無為皆非實有，如色受等別有實物，此所無故。	Here, the master of the treatise cites the Sautrāntika theory that all unconditioned dharmas do not really exist, because they do not exist separately as real substances like form, feeling, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a24_15']	然經說者唯無所觸說名虛空，謂於闇中無所觸對，便作是說：	然經說者唯無所觸說名虛空，謂於闇中無所觸對，便作是說：	However, the scriptures say that only the absence of contact is called space. When in the dark there is no contact, one says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a25_1', 'ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a26_6']	此是虛空。🔽已起隨眠生種滅位，由揀擇力餘不更生，說名擇滅。	此是虛空。 已起隨眠生種滅位，由揀擇力餘不更生，說名擇滅。	This is space.🔽When the seeds of the already arisen latent afflictions are destroyed, due to the power of discernment the remaining [afflictions] do not arise again, and this is called cessation through discernment.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a27_17']	離揀擇力，由闕緣故餘不更生，名非擇滅，如殘眾同分中夭者餘蘊。	離揀擇力，由闕緣故餘不更生，名非擇滅，如殘眾同分中夭者餘蘊。	Apart from the power of discernment, due to the lack of conditions the remaining [afflictions] do not arise again, and this is called cessation not through discernment, like the remaining aggregates of one who dies prematurely.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a28_8']	此皆非理，無因證故。	此皆非理，無因證故。	This is all unreasonable, because there is no evidence.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429a29_16']	且彼所言唯無所觸說名虛空，無觸名空我亦信受，空無觸故。	且彼所言唯無所觸說名虛空，無觸名空我亦信受，空無觸故。	First, regarding what they say, that only the absence of contact is called space, and that space is the absence of contact, we also believe and accept this, because space is without contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b01_15']	言唯無觸說名虛空，非別有體，此何因證？	言唯無觸說名虛空，非別有體，此何因證？	As for the statement that only the absence of contact is called space, and that it does not have a separate substance, what evidence is there for this?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b02_10']	已證闇中無所觸對，便作是說：	已證闇中無所觸對，便作是說：	It has already been proven that in the dark there is no contact, and then one says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b02_15']	此是虛空。	此是虛空。	This is space.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b04_3']	豈不此因能證非有，非唯用此所說為因能證虛空決定非有。	豈不此因能證非有，非唯用此所說為因能證虛空決定非有。	Isn't this evidence able to prove that it does not exist? It is not only by using this statement as evidence that one can prove that space definitely does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b04_17']	謂彼但說此是虛空，非所觸對。	謂彼但說此是虛空，非所觸對。	They only say that this is space, which is not in contact with anything.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b05_11']	如何知彼唯於無觸說名虛空？	如何知彼唯於無觸說名虛空？	How do we know that they only say space is the absence of contact?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b05_16']	如世說言：	如世說言：	As the world says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b06_2']	此樂非苦。	此樂非苦。	This pleasure is not suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b06_11']	豈唯無苦說名為樂？	豈唯無苦說名為樂？	How can it be that only the absence of suffering is called pleasure?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b07_11']	若謂不然，苦樂二受有損有益，所作別故。	若謂不然，苦樂二受有損有益，所作別故。	If it is not so, then the two feelings of suffering and pleasure have harm and benefit, because their functions are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b09_18']	非此虛空少有所作，可得如樂，故喻不同，是則前因應成無用，由今但以虛空都無所作可得證非有故。	非此虛空少有所作，可得如樂，故喻不同，是則前因應成無用，由今但以虛空都無所作可得證非有故。	This space has little function, and it cannot be obtained like pleasure, so the analogy is not the same. This means that the previous reason should be useless, because now it is only used to prove that space definitely does not exist because it has no function that can be obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b12_6']	且定不可以無觸對謂是虛空為決定因，證虛空體唯無所觸，是則經主此中無因能證虛空決定非有。	且定不可以無觸對謂是虛空為決定因，證虛空體唯無所觸，是則經主此中無因能證虛空決定非有。	Moreover, it cannot be definitely used as a reason that space is said to be the absence of contact to prove that the substance of space is only the absence of contact. This means that the author of the treatise has no reason here that can prove that space definitely does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b12_11']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Moreover, a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b13_6']	虛空無為，有所作故，非不如樂。	虛空無為，有所作故，非不如樂。	Unconditioned space exists because it has a function, and it is not like pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b13_11']	如世尊說：	如世尊說：	As the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b14_4']	風依虛空，無作有依，非有心執。	風依虛空，無作有依，非有心執。	Wind relies on space, without action there is reliance, not with mental grasping.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b14_13']	又光明色是虛空相。	又光明色是虛空相。	Moreover, light color is the characteristic of space.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b15_3']	故知虛空其體實有。	故知虛空其體實有。	Therefore, we know that the substance of space truly exists.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b15_8']	如契經說：	如契經說：	As a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b15_18']	然藉光明，虛空顯了。	然藉光明，虛空顯了。	However, it relies on light for space to be revealed.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b17_1']	由此定顯虛空之相，所謂光明，所以契經復說此語。	由此定顯虛空之相，所謂光明，所以契經復說此語。	This definitely shows the characteristic of space, namely light. Therefore, the sutra again says this:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b18_8']	謂佛先說風依虛空，後說虛空無所依止，勿彼梵志生如是疑：	謂佛先說風依虛空，後說虛空無所依止，勿彼梵志生如是疑：	The Buddha previously said that wind relies on space, and later said that space has no support. Do not let those Brahmins give rise to such doubts:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b18_17']	如何證知虛空是有？	如何證知虛空是有？	How can we know that space exists?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b19_17']	而世尊說風依虛空，為遣彼疑，復說此語。	而世尊說風依虛空，為遣彼疑，復說此語。	Yet the World-Honored One says that wind relies on space. To dispel their doubts, he again says this.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b20_7']	若空非有，何藉光明？	若空非有，何藉光明？	If space does not exist, what need is there for light?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b20_16']	光明有色有見有對。	光明有色有見有對。	Light has color, is visible, and has resistance.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b21_6']	若無虛空，誰能容受？	若無虛空，誰能容受？	If there were no space, what could contain it?
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b22_12']	故世尊說然藉光明虛空顯者，顯光明色能與虛空為實有相。	故世尊說然藉光明虛空顯者，顯光明色能與虛空為實有相。	Therefore, the World-Honored One says that it relies on light for space to be revealed. This reveals that light color can serve as the characteristic of the true existence of space.
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b23_12']	然彼上座不了此經所說義趣，妄作是詰：	然彼上座不了此經所說義趣，妄作是詰：	However, that elder did not understand the meaning expressed in this sūtra and falsely asked this question:
['ZH_T29_1562_017:0429b24_11']	若藉光明，虛空顯了，虛空應是色法所收。	若藉光明，虛空顯了，虛空應是色法所收。	If it is illuminated by light, and space is manifested, then space should be categorized as a form dharma.
