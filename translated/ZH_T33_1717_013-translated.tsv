['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909a28_18']	次「二者」下明藏等四，且置頓與不定，令識漸中四相分明，復須除祕故云「顯露」。	次「二者」下明藏等四，且置頓與不定，令識漸中四相分明，復須除祕故云「顯露」。	Next, after second, it clarifies the four such as the Tripitaka. It sets aside the sudden and the indeterminate, allowing one to recognize the four aspects in the gradual clearly. It also needs to remove the secret, therefore it says revealed.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909b01_2']	秖是重分別前漸中所用四法之相，故云「更明」。	秖是重分別前漸中所用四法之相，故云「更明」。	It is just a repeated distinction of the four dharmas used in the previous gradual, therefore it says further clarification.

How bitter it is to give rise to false comparisons and decisions!

Therefore, it is so.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909b07_13']	今藏等中離人為界，故藏三通四，通真含中以為佛界故爾。	今藏等中離人為界，故藏三通四，通真含中以為佛界故爾。	Now, in the Tripiṭaka and other teachings, the realms are distinguished by the people. Therefore, the Tripiṭaka has three, the Shared has four, and the Distinct has five. The Shared truth includes the middle way, which is taken as the Buddha realm, so it is so.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909b08_10']	此以兩教佛界有教無人故置不說。	此以兩教佛界有教無人故置不說。	This is because the two teachings of the Buddha realm have teachings but no people, so they are left out and not discussed.

However, in establishing this sudden and gradual, manifest and secret sequence, it must be expounded in the form of a Buddha with the eight characteristics.

Therefore, it is known that its number of verses cannot be known by measuring the number of drops of seawater or the number of hairs. It cannot be written with ink made from grinding Mount Sumeru. Therefore, it is known that the number of verses brought from the West can be few?

['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909b29_9']	於正明相中，先明人天，次明出世。	於正明相中，先明人天，次明出世。	In the section on clarifying the characteristics, first, the human and heavenly [teachings] are clarified, and then the supramundane [teachings] are clarified.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909c02_18']	初文中云「人天教永不詮真，但詮思議之俗」者，但是俗而非諦，望出世法，屬俗諦攝，故云「思議俗」耳。	初文中云「人天教永不詮真，但詮思議之俗」者，但是俗而非諦，望出世法，屬俗諦攝，故云「思議俗」耳。	In the initial text, it says the human and heavenly teachings never expound the truth, but only expound the conceivable conventional. This is only conventional and not a truth. From the perspective of supramundane teachings, it belongs to the category of the conventional truth, therefore it is called the conceivable conventional.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909c03_7']	次出世中先漸、次頓。	次出世中先漸、次頓。	Next, in the supramundane [teachings], first gradual, then sudden.

At the beginning, it only speaks of impermanence, suffering, and so forth, therefore it is said it correctly interprets the conceivable conventional.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909c08_13']	雖通涅槃，涅槃是小乘法性，若初詮法性，恐增邪倒，不能破於常等僻，故「俗正真傍」。	雖通涅槃，涅槃是小乘法性，若初詮法性，恐增邪倒，不能破於常等僻，故「俗正真傍」。	Although it is common to nirvāṇa, nirvāṇa is the nature of the Lesser Vehicle. If it first interprets the nature of dharmas, it may increase wrong views. It cannot destroy the biases of permanence and so forth, therefore the conventional is primary and the true is secondary.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909c10_6']	無常少寬即正示真理，則無常幻化悉皆為傍，是故次云「真正俗傍」。	無常少寬即正示真理，則無常幻化悉皆為傍，是故次云「真正俗傍」。	Impermanence is slightly broader, which directly indicates true reality. Then impermanence and illusory transformations are all secondary. Therefore, the next sentence says the true is primary and the conventional is secondary.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909c12_2']	既獲小果，正欲令其入真中道，傍以菩薩不思議真兼帶而說，故云「真正俗傍」。	既獲小果，正欲令其入真中道，傍以菩薩不思議真兼帶而說，故云「真正俗傍」。	Having already attained the small fruit, it correctly wishes to cause them to enter the true middle way, and secondarily teaches the inconceivable true of the bodhisattvas together with the conventional. Therefore, it is said the true is primary and the conventional is secondary.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0909c14_9']	言「中後」者，此兼方等、般若兩意，故方等中所得小果，多因正詮思議之真，至般若中即不思議之傍正也。	言「中後」者，此兼方等、般若兩意，故方等中所得小果，多因正詮思議之真，至般若中即不思議之傍正也。	As for middle and later, this combines the two meanings of Vaipulya and Prajñā. Therefore, in the Vaipulya period, the small fruits obtained are mostly due to the correct interpretation of the conceivable truth, and in the Prajñā period, it is the inconceivable truth that is both the main and the secondary.

Therefore, the previous text clarifies that the initial mind of the two vehicles only says that the conventional [truth] is primary and the true [truth] is secondary. Later, since it is divided according to the teachings, the Tripiṭaka [teaching] is divided into two sections. From the perspective of principle, the bodhisattvas in both places are both primary in the conventional [truth] and secondary in the true [truth]. The practitioners of the two vehicles in both places are both primary in the true [truth] and secondary in the conventional [truth]. This is because the bodhisattva vehicle is the same as the initial mind of the two vehicles.

These two are both about the meaning of the sutra, and therefore only one sound and one principle are established. Although it is said to be coarse and subtle, the meaning is already appropriate.

Therefore it says, The ultimate non-arising and non-cessation of all dharmas is the meaning of impermanence. Therefore, know that the arising and cessation of all dharmas is merely impermanence, not the meaning of impermanence. Analyzing this arising with the four propositions, it is originally non-arising and also non-cessation, only then can it be called the meaning of impermanence.

The ultimate non-existence of all dharmas is the meaning of emptiness. Not distinguishing between self and non-self is the meaning of non-self. The dharmas originally do not arise and now do not cease is the meaning of quiescent cessation. The other examples can be understood by thinking about the first sentence.

The gradual aspect is like that of Chandaka, and the sudden aspect is like that of Subhuti. The response is like the two birds of nirvana flying together and not being able to be separated. Therefore, the true meaning of impermanence is now explained as not apart from permanence, and thus it is said that non-arising and non-cessation is the meaning of impermanence.

If non-arising and non-cessation are spoken of, it is concluded as belonging to the indeterminate. If concluded as impermanence, it belongs to the four withered trees. If concluded as permanence, it belongs to the four flourishing trees. If concluded as neither impermanence nor permanence, it belongs to the four trees that are neither withered nor flourishing. The following four phrases can be understood based on this.

Therefore, it is only in the second chapter that the nine, three, one, and eleven are used to distinguish the Great and Small Vehicles in terms of the general and specific. Therefore, the first two chapters are merely the means of expression. Applying this means of expression to what is to be reached, there is the chapter on conditions. Because the conditions are not the same, the expressed meaning is different.

The means of reaching, what is to be reached, the means of expression, and the expressed meaning, from beginning to end, manifest the teaching for one period. In order to clarify the coarse and wonderful of what is spoken and what is transformed, it is also necessary to open up these coarse and non-coarse. Therefore, the fifth chapter is necessary to judge, open, and establish together, only then can it begin to manifest the Dharma that is spoken, and finally be equipped with the two wonderful meanings of dependence and transcendence.

Since what is to be reached is pure, one can recognize the wonderful means of reaching. Since what is expressed is recognized, one can understand the fusion of the means of expression. Therefore, all that has come before belongs to the teaching.

['ZH_T33_1717_013:0913a19_6']	依願立名，事亦局凡，通非無願亦從勝立名亦通後，事局小聖及以大賢，不通於凡。	依願立名，事亦局凡，通非無願亦從勝立名亦通後，事局小聖及以大賢，不通於凡。	The name is established based on the vow, and the matter is also limited to ordinary people. The common non-vow is also established based on the superior. The name is also common to the later, but the matter is limited to the small sage and the great virtuous, and does not apply to ordinary people.

Some who should come can be called the one who should be born in common, but the matter is limited to the great sage and does not apply to the small virtuous.

The matter is limited to the world-transcending and does not apply to delusion.

['ZH_T33_1717_013:0913a26_4']	然法門及以業願通應莫不觀心，但為隨事得名既殊，故以觀心別置科目。	然法門及以業願通應莫不觀心，但為隨事得名既殊，故以觀心別置科目。	However, the Dharma gate and the vow of karma are all contemplating the mind, but because the names obtained according to the matter are different, the contemplation of the mind is placed in a separate category.
['ZH_T33_1717_013:0913a28_7']	又《淨名》所答正從理觀，然亦未得觀心名者，以對事立稱觀道不專，故立觀心唯對一境。	又《淨名》所答正從理觀，然亦未得觀心名者，以對事立稱觀道不專，故立觀心唯對一境。	Moreover, the answers in the Vimalakīrti Sūtra are based on principle contemplation, but they are not yet called contemplation of the mind, because the path of contemplation is established in response to phenomena and is not exclusive, so the contemplation of the mind is only established in relation to a single object.

Although the previous texts briefly describe them based on what is nearby, they are not as comprehensive as the general judgment and opening up after the text. Therefore, after the correct explanation, another section is established.
