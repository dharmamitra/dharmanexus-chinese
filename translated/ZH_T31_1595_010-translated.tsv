['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221b14_6', 'ZH_T31_1595_010:0221b14_13']	五於下乘般涅槃無明；🔽六麁相行無明；	五於下乘般涅槃無明； 六麁相行無明；	010	Fifth, the ignorance of attaining parinirvāṇa in the lower vehicle;🔽Sixth, the ignorance of coarse characteristics and practices;

If this ignorance is not eradicated, one will not be able to enter the first ground. Therefore, this ignorance is the obstacle of the first ground.
['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221b22_13']	依身業等於諸眾生起邪行無明，是二地障。	依身業等於諸眾生起邪行無明，是二地障。	010	The ignorance that gives rise to wrong practices toward sentient beings based on physical actions and so forth is the obstacle of the second ground.

['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221b29_12']	若不斷此無明，則不得入二地，故此無明為二地障。	若不斷此無明，則不得入二地，故此無明為二地障。	010	If one does not eliminate this ignorance, one cannot enter the second ground. Therefore, this ignorance is an obstacle to the second ground.
['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c01_12']	心遲苦無明，聞思修忘失無明，是三地障。	心遲苦無明，聞思修忘失無明，是三地障。	010	The ignorance of slowness and suffering in the mind, the ignorance of forgetting what one has heard, contemplated, and cultivated, is an obstacle to the third ground.

Because it obstructs the faculties and cultivation, it is called the ignorance obstacle.

['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c07_16']	煩惱行者，法執分別種子為體，生住滅不停故名行。	煩惱行者，法執分別種子為體，生住滅不停故名行。	010	The activity of afflictions takes the seeds of the discrimination of the attachment to dharmas as its essence, because birth, abiding, and cessation do not stop, it is called activity.
['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c09_5']	此種子為身見因，此種子體亦即是身見，以是法分別種類故。	此種子為身見因，此種子體亦即是身見，以是法分別種類故。	010	This seed is the cause of the view of a self, and this seed itself is also the view of a self, because it is the type of discrimination of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c10_1']	此煩惱最下品故者，此釋微細義。	此煩惱最下品故者，此釋微細義。	010	Because this affliction is the most inferior type means this explains the meaning of subtlety.

['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c13_11']	雖復不能染菩薩心，隨正思惟起，與正思惟相應，故不可說無，以能障菩薩一切智故。	雖復不能染菩薩心，隨正思惟起，與正思惟相應，故不可說無，以能障菩薩一切智故。	010	Although it cannot defile the mind of a bodhisattva, it arises in accordance with correct thought, and is associated with correct thought, and therefore it cannot be said to be nonexistent, because it can obstruct the omniscience of a bodhisattva.
['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c14_10']	已遠離隨順本所行事故者，此釋離伴義。	已遠離隨順本所行事故者，此釋離伴義。	010	Because it has already been abandoned and the accompanying activities of the past have been eliminated means this explains the meaning of being separated from companions.

['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c24_3']	若不斷此無明，不得入五地，故此無明為五地障。	若不斷此無明，不得入五地，故此無明為五地障。	010	If one does not eliminate this ignorance, one will not be able to enter the fifth ground, so this ignorance is an obstruction to the fifth ground.
['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c24_14']	麁相行無明，是六地障。	麁相行無明，是六地障。	010	The ignorance of the coarse characteristics and activities is the obstacle of the sixth ground.
['ZH_T31_1595_010:0221c27_1']	若人修行六地，一切諸行相續生如量如理證已，多住厭惡諸行心中，未能多住無相心中，故稱無明。	若人修行六地，一切諸行相續生如量如理證已，多住厭惡諸行心中，未能多住無相心中，故稱無明。	010	If a person cultivates the sixth ground, having already realized the continuity of arising of all characteristics according to their extent and according to principle, they often dwell in a mind that detests the continuity of characteristics, but they are still unable to often dwell in a mind without characteristics, and therefore it is called ignorance.
