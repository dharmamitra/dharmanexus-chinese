Fearing that the text will be too verbose, I will now give a small portion of similes.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T45_1893_002:0827a03_9']	結使者，阿梨邪藏染分種子名之為結；	結使者，阿梨邪藏染分種子名之為結；	The afflictions are the seeds of the defiled part of the store consciousness, which are called bonds;

The pursuit of afflictions continues for a moment.

Due to love and hatred, one forms the karma of grasping and abandoning. Because of falsely grasping and abandoning, delusion thickens, which obstructs the wisdom eye.
['ZH_T45_1893_002:0827a12_18']	慧眼未開名無明闇，闇心緣事，與顛倒相應，抱真常性愛生死苦，生死流浪，迷失正道。	慧眼未開名無明闇，闇心緣事，與顛倒相應，抱真常性愛生死苦，生死流浪，迷失正道。	The eye of wisdom not yet opened is called the darkness of ignorance. The mind of darkness conditions things, and is associated with inverted views. Embracing the nature of true permanence, it loves the suffering of birth and death. Wandering in birth and death, it loses the right path in confusion.
['ZH_T45_1893_002:0827a14_17']	未見正道名為迷惑，無常常想，無樂樂想，無我見我，無淨見淨，如是狂錯皆因結使。	未見正道名為迷惑，無常常想，無樂樂想，無我見我，無淨見淨，如是狂錯皆因結使。	Not yet seeing the right path is called confusion. The view of permanence in impermanence, the view of happiness in suffering, the view of self in non-self, and the view of purity in impurity - such madness and error all arise from the afflictions.
['ZH_T45_1893_002:0827a17_13']	如是結使造顛倒業，欲斷結使即修五停觀法以對治之，安般守意入三脫門，觀空離相結使斷除，身心寂靜，故不起煩惱。	如是結使造顛倒業，欲斷結使即修五停觀法以對治之，安般守意入三脫門，觀空離相結使斷除，身心寂靜，故不起煩惱。	Such afflictions create inverted karma. To cut off the afflictions, one cultivates the five methods of stopping and contemplating to counteract them. Mindfulness of breathing enters the three gates of liberation. Contemplating emptiness and detaching from characteristics, the afflictions are eliminated. Body and mind are tranquil, so afflictions do not arise.
['ZH_T45_1893_002:0827a19_9']	煩惱滅處名真解脫，解脫者則大涅槃，欲起染心當自挫辱，挫不令散，名為淨心。	煩惱滅處名真解脫，解脫者則大涅槃，欲起染心當自挫辱，挫不令散，名為淨心。	The place where afflictions cease is called true liberation. Liberation is great nirvana. If one wants to give rise to defiled thoughts, one should humble oneself. Subduing and not letting them scatter is called a pure mind.
