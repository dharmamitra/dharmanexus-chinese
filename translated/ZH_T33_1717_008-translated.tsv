['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a10_1']	「因於拙教果復不融」者，次第為拙，教門所說果理不融，以果隔越不與因理融通故也。	「因於拙教果復不融」者，次第為拙，教門所說果理不融，以果隔越不與因理融通故也。	The cause is based on the clumsy teaching, and the effect is not yet fused means that the sequence is clumsy, and the principle of the effect taught by the teaching gate is not yet fused, because the effect is separated and does not merge with the principle of the cause.

['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a16_8']	判中云「若待十智為麁」者，《大品》十一智，十智同小乘，第十一如實智屬大乘。	判中云「若待十智為麁」者，《大品》十一智，十智同小乘，第十一如實智屬大乘。	In the analysis, it says if the ten knowledges are taken as coarse, the eleven knowledges in the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra are the same as the ten knowledges in the Lesser Vehicle, and the eleventh knowledge of suchness belongs to the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a17_11']	今文大小通立如實，於諸如實中唯圓如實為妙。	今文大小通立如實，於諸如實中唯圓如實為妙。	Now, the text establishes suchness in both the Lesser and Great Vehicles, and among all suchnesses, only the perfect suchness is wonderful.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a18_8']	次開顯者，唯開顯如實方成妙實。	次開顯者，唯開顯如實方成妙實。	Next, revealing the wonderful truth only reveals the suchness of the wonderful truth.

['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a23_1']	六境既展轉開合，故須六智隨其開合亦隨境轉照，若智隨境得名，是則諸智亦義同名異；	六境既展轉開合，故須六智隨其開合亦隨境轉照，若智隨境得名，是則諸智亦義同名異；	Since the six objects go back and forth between opening and combining, the six knowledges must follow their opening and combining and also turn to illuminate according to the objects. If the knowledges are named according to the objects, then the various knowledges also have the same meaning but different names;
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a24_14']	名異故各照，義同故傳照，是則不可思議境智，一境一切境、一智一切智。	名異故各照，義同故傳照，是則不可思議境智，一境一切境、一智一切智。	The names are different, so they each illuminate; the meanings are the same, so they transmit illumination. This is the inconceivable realm and wisdom, one realm and all realms, one wisdom and all wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a26_17']	如可思議中尚六界十如結攝一切異名諸境，諸境亦爾、諸智亦然，況不思議大小偏圓互相攝耶？	如可思議中尚六界十如結攝一切異名諸境，諸境亦爾、諸智亦然，況不思議大小偏圓互相攝耶？	In the conceivable, there are still the six elements and ten suchnesses that summarize all different realms. All realms are also like this, and all wisdoms are also so. How much more so for the inconceivable, where the partial and perfect, large and small, mutually include each other?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a28_14']	故下結云諦融智融圓成開顯法華妙旨，若不見始終妙意，徒自云云何益者乎？	故下結云諦融智融圓成開顯法華妙旨，若不見始終妙意，徒自云云何益者乎？	Therefore, the conclusion below says that the truths merge, the wisdom merges, and the perfect accomplishment reveals the wonderful meaning of the Lotus Sutra. If one does not see the wonderful meaning from beginning to end, how can one benefit by merely speaking about it?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a29_1']	於中又四：	於中又四：	Within this, there are four more points:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869a29_7']	初正明傳照。	初正明傳照。	The first is to clarify the transmission of illumination.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b01_9']	次「如此等」下義當於判開，傳照如判，俱融如開。	次「如此等」下義當於判開，傳照如判，俱融如開。	Next, such as these corresponds to the division and revelation. The transmission of illumination is like the division, and the merging of both is like the revelation.

['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b03_2']	四略以智例境也。	四略以智例境也。	Fourth, it briefly uses wisdom to exemplify the realm.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b05_16']	初文者，秖是以後智傳照前境，十如居初故不論智，據理亦應以十如智照於五境，是則六智一一皆能照於五境。	初文者，秖是以後智傳照前境，十如居初故不論智，據理亦應以十如智照於五境，是則六智一一皆能照於五境。	The first text only uses later wisdom to transmit illumination to the previous realm. The ten suchnesses are the first, so wisdom is not discussed. According to principle, the wisdom of the ten suchnesses should also illuminate the five realms. This means that each of the six wisdoms can illuminate the five realms.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b06_7']	如文可見，不須委論。	如文可見，不須委論。	As can be seen in the text, it does not need to be discussed in detail.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b08_8']	若不解此，諸境諸智若大若小更相間入，若判若開互為法界，如何能識《法華》所宗？	若不解此，諸境諸智若大若小更相間入，若判若開互為法界，如何能識《法華》所宗？	If one does not understand this, the various realms and wisdoms, whether large or small, will repeatedly enter each other. If judged or opened, they will mutually become the Dharma realm. How can one understand the fundamental purport of the Lotus Sutra?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b10_4']	豈能了於一心妙境境智相稱，如何能見下諸妙文所依所發乃至化他不思議用？	豈能了於一心妙境境智相稱，如何能見下諸妙文所依所發乃至化他不思議用？	How can one understand the wondrous realm of the one mind, where the realm and wisdom correspond? How can one see the wondrous texts below, which are based on and arise from this? And up to the inconceivable function of transforming others?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b11_16']	妙感妙應乃至眷屬並從此生，乃至本證亦不出此，人不見之謂為煩芿。	妙感妙應乃至眷屬並從此生，乃至本證亦不出此，人不見之謂為煩芿。	The wondrous response and even the retinue all arise from this. Even the fundamental realization does not go beyond this. People do not see it and call it troublesome.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b12_15']	次明行妙中，文自為二，今又為三：	次明行妙中，文自為二，今又為三：	Next, in explaining the wondrous practice, the text itself has two parts. Now it is divided into three:

['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b14_7']	初文又二：	初文又二：	The first text is also two:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b15_5']	初對前境智舉麁，次「妙行者」下顯妙。	初對前境智舉麁，次「妙行者」下顯妙。	First, opposite the previous realm and wisdom raising the coarse, next wonderful practice and below revealing the wonderful.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b15_10']	初文又三：	初文又三：	The first text is also three:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b16_16']	初明三法次第相須，次明三法更互相顯，三「如此」下結。	初明三法次第相須，次明三法更互相顯，三「如此」下結。	First, clarifying the three dharmas in sequence mutually requiring, next clarifying the three dharmas again mutually revealing, third like this and below concluding.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b18_7']	初文者，行假智、智假境，智行是能到、理境是所到，到清涼池也。	初文者，行假智、智假境，智行是能到、理境是所到，到清涼池也。	The first text, practice relying on wisdom, wisdom relying on realm, wisdom and practice are able to reach, principle realm is that which is reached, reaching the clear and cool pool.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b18_18']	次文者，「解」即智也。	次文者，「解」即智也。	The next text, understanding is wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b21_8']	智為行本則行藉智生，行能成智則智藉行成，智能顯理智生則理生，理未窮故則智未息，故理生則智生。	智為行本則行藉智生，行能成智則智藉行成，智能顯理智生則理生，理未窮故則智未息，故理生則智生。	Wisdom as the root of practice then practice relying on wisdom arising, practice able to accomplish wisdom then wisdom relying on practice accomplishing, wisdom able to reveal principle wisdom arising then principle arising, principle not yet exhausted then wisdom not yet ceasing, therefore principle arising then wisdom arising.

['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b21_15']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b24_1']	若一心三智為妙行本，乃至一心三智照中道理到於初住清涼池者，何麁之有而斥為非妙耶？	若一心三智為妙行本，乃至一心三智照中道理到於初住清涼池者，何麁之有而斥為非妙耶？	If the three contemplations in one mind are the basis of wonderful practice, and if one contemplates the principle in the middle with the three contemplations in one mind and reaches the cool pond of the initial abode, then what coarseness is there to be refuted as not being wonderful?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b24_3']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b27_2']	似如所問，今云麁者，未見一理而三理乃至一行而三行，乃至六即初後俱三，三一不殊，初後不二，乃至修德性德一念三身等。	似如所問，今云麁者，未見一理而三理乃至一行而三行，乃至六即初後俱三，三一不殊，初後不二，乃至修德性德一念三身等。	It is similar to the question asked now. The coarse one has not yet seen one principle and three principles, up to one practice and three practices, up to the six identities, the initial and final are both three, three and one are not different, the initial and final are not two, up to the virtues of cultivation and the virtues of nature, the three bodies in one thought, and so forth.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b27_11']	若如是者方名妙行。	若如是者方名妙行。	If it is like this, then it is called wonderful practice.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b28_2']	「妙行者」下釋其相也。	「妙行者」下釋其相也。	Wonderful practice below explains its characteristics.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869b28_14']	次釋妙行中，初標，次釋。	次釋妙行中，初標，次釋。	Next, in explaining wonderful practice, first it is labeled, then explained.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c01_14']	初言「一行一切行」者，須約六即以明三德，今言行者多在住前，三法妙顯多於初住故也。	初言「一行一切行」者，須約六即以明三德，今言行者多在住前，三法妙顯多於初住故也。	The first says one practice is all practices. It must be discussed in terms of the six identities to clarify the three virtues. Now, the practitioner is mostly in the stage before the ten faiths. The three dharmas are wonderfully manifested, mostly in the initial abode, therefore.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c01_16']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c02_7']	一行一切行其相如何？	一行一切行其相如何？	What are the characteristics of one practice being all practices?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c02_9']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c05_7']	如四三昧是菩薩行，一一三昧無非法界諸度具足，故一施一戒皆具三諦三智三德，成波羅蜜，攝諸善法，是故名為一切行也。	如四三昧是菩薩行，一一三昧無非法界諸度具足，故一施一戒皆具三諦三智三德，成波羅蜜，攝諸善法，是故名為一切行也。	Like the four samādhis, which are the practices of bodhisattvas, each samādhi is not apart from the Dharma realm, and all the pāramitās are complete. Therefore, each act of giving and each precept all possess the three truths, three knowledges, and three virtues, accomplishing the pāramitās and subsuming all wholesome dharmas. This is called all practices.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c05_12']	次釋又二：	次釋又二：	Next, the explanation is also in two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c06_4']	先正釋，次與境智互融。	先正釋，次與境智互融。	First, the correct explanation, second, the mutual fusion of objects and wisdom.

['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c06_18']	初引經，次結成三德。	初引經，次結成三德。	First, citing the sūtra, second, concluding with the three virtues.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c07_2']	初如文。	初如文。	The first part is as the text.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c10_12']	次文言「深盡」等者，「盡」即法身，「具」即解脫，「深」即般若，如此三德在一心中，境即理性三德，智即三德之解，行即三德之觀，始從觀行，終至六根，無非妙法。	次文言「深盡」等者，「盡」即法身，「具」即解脫，「深」即般若，如此三德在一心中，境即理性三德，智即三德之解，行即三德之觀，始從觀行，終至六根，無非妙法。	The next passage says deeply exhausting and so on. Exhausting refers to the Dharma body, endowed refers to liberation, and deep refers to prajñā. Such three virtues are in one mind. The object is the three virtues of principle, wisdom is the understanding of the three virtues, and practice is the contemplation of the three virtues. Beginning from contemplation and practice, up to the six sense faculties, there is nothing that is not the wonderful Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c10_17']	次文又三：	次文又三：	The next passage is also in three parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c11_19']	先總明，次「前境說」下別明，三「若三」下結。	先總明，次「前境說」下別明，三「若三」下結。	First, generally clarify, next, below the spoken realm specifically clarify, third, below if three conclude.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c14_5']	初言「與前境智一而論三」者，「一」謂涅槃，「三」謂三德，「境」是法身，「智」是般若，「行」是解脫，當知秖一涅槃而論此三。	初言「與前境智一而論三」者，「一」謂涅槃，「三」謂三德，「境」是法身，「智」是般若，「行」是解脫，當知秖一涅槃而論此三。	The first says with the realm and wisdom one, yet speak of three - one refers to nirvana, three refers to the three virtues, realm is the Dharma body, wisdom is prajñā, practice is liberation, one should know that it is only one nirvana, yet speak of these three.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c15_6']	又境即理三，智即名字三，行即觀行相似三也。	又境即理三，智即名字三，行即觀行相似三也。	Moreover, the realm is the principle three, wisdom is the name three, and practice is the contemplation and similarity three.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c16_8']	當知九秖是三，三秖是一，一尚無一，豈有九三？	當知九秖是三，三秖是一，一尚無一，豈有九三？	One should know that nine is only three, and three is only one, since one is still not one, how could there be nine or three?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c16_13']	二三如文。	二三如文。	The two and three are as the text.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c16_19']	次正釋中二：	次正釋中二：	Next, in the correct explanation there are two:
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c17_13']	先敘來意，次「若直」下正釋。	先敘來意，次「若直」下正釋。	First, state the reason for coming, next, below if direct correctly explain.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c18_4']	釋中先釋通途，次釋約教。	釋中先釋通途，次釋約教。	In the explanation, first explain the general course, next explain the teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c19_7']	言通途者，還依向妙以立通途，未判屬一教故也。	言通途者，還依向妙以立通途，未判屬一教故也。	As for the general course, it still relies on the wonderful to establish the general course, because it has not yet been divided into one teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c20_19']	隨教各別自明增數，故曰「約教」，如諸部中有共教者，即其事也。	隨教各別自明增數，故曰「約教」，如諸部中有共教者，即其事也。	Following the teachings, each has its own distinct increase in numbers, therefore it is called based on the teachings. As in the various schools there are those with common teachings, this is exactly that matter.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c23_1']	所謂華嚴共二，乃至般若共三，於諸部中復有同聽異聞自成約教，故須有此二種釋義。	所謂華嚴共二，乃至般若共三，於諸部中復有同聽異聞自成約教，故須有此二種釋義。	It is said that the Huayan has two in common, up to the Prajna has three in common. Within the various schools there are also those who hear the same but understand differently, which naturally becomes based on the teachings. Therefore, these two kinds of explanations are necessary.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c24_10']	所以列此增數行者，為知行妙遍收諸行，攝一切教所明諸行。	所以列此增數行者，為知行妙遍收諸行，攝一切教所明諸行。	The reason for listing these increased numbers of practices is to know that the wonderful practice universally includes all practices, and includes all the practices explained in the teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c25_19']	相須之行正在別教，藏通二教亦有此義，而理淺近置而不論。	相須之行正在別教，藏通二教亦有此義，而理淺近置而不論。	The practice of mutual reliance is mainly in the distinct teaching. The two teachings of the canon and the shared also have this meaning, but the principle is shallow and close, so it is set aside and not discussed.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c28_16']	今明圓人境智行三，一一具三方名行妙，如行即有具深盡三，依理起解名為智三，理體即是理性之三，此之三三不假相須。	今明圓人境智行三，一一具三方名行妙，如行即有具深盡三，依理起解名為智三，理體即是理性之三，此之三三不假相須。	Now, explaining the three of realm, cognition, and practice for the perfect person, each one is endowed with three, which is then called the wonderful practice. As in practice, there is the endowment of the three, exhausting the three based on principle, giving rise to understanding is called the three of cognition, and the essence of principle is precisely the three of the principle of nature. These three sets of three do not need to rely on each other.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0869c29_15']	復以境智行三，用對三德，不縱不橫。	復以境智行三，用對三德，不縱不橫。	Furthermore, using the three of realm, cognition, and practice to correspond to the three virtues, not vertically nor horizontally.

['ZH_T33_1717_008:0870a01_4']	何故不名增一？	何故不名增一？	Why is it not called increasing by one?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0870a02_2']	如《增一阿含》及《毘尼》等，而言增數耶？	如《增一阿含》及《毘尼》等，而言增數耶？	Like the Ekottarikâgama and the Vinaya and so forth, why is it said to be increasing in number?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0870a02_4']	答：	答：	Answer:

The assembly of the Great and Lesser Vehicles universally uses the precepts to determine their positions, therefore each relies on the precepts to determine their positions. Thus, the bodhisattvas are great when among the great, and small when among the small. Therefore, it is known that when the bodhisattvas are in the assembly of the Lesser Vehicle, they still sit according to the positions of the Lesser Vehicle, and when among the assembly of the Great Vehicle, they sit according to the positions of the Great Vehicle.

First, asking questions and answering to distinguish, distinguishing the coarse precepts is what is opened, which is a further distinction.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0873b21_6']	於判麁妙文以顯開麁，故下結云「此說猶是待麁之戒」，他既不曾分於四菩薩別，今問三祇菩薩及《大品》中三乘共位菩薩為持何戒？	於判麁妙文以顯開麁，故下結云「此說猶是待麁之戒」，他既不曾分於四菩薩別，今問三祇菩薩及《大品》中三乘共位菩薩為持何戒？	In the text on distinguishing the coarse and wonderful, it clarifies the opening of the coarse, therefore the conclusion below says this explanation is still the precepts that are relative to the coarse. Since others have never divided the four bodhisattvas separately, now the question is, which precepts are upheld by the bodhisattvas of the three asaṃkhyeya kalpas and the bodhisattvas of the shared stages of the three vehicles in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra?
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0873b22_4']	若持梵網，何故重仍存四、輕分四篇？	若持梵網，何故重仍存四、輕分四篇？	If one upholds the Brahma Net Sutra, why are the four grave precepts still retained and the four light precepts divided into four sections?

Such differences cannot be fully explained.

If a monastic bodhisattva fully uses the white four [part ceremony], but for the sake of protecting others, the six grave precepts are added as restrictions, which is only slightly different from the Hinayana. The other light and grave [precepts] each follow their respective teachings.

The two sutras of the Tripiṭaka and Shared do not list the assemblies separately, but monastics are in the two monastic assemblies and laypeople are in the two lay assemblies. Therefore, we know that they still follow the sequence of the two monastic precepts of the Hinayana. Therefore, the two teachings do not have separate bodhisattva precepts.
['ZH_T33_1717_008:0873c02_4']	故《大論》三十八云：	故《大論》三十八云：	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says in chapter 38:
