['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144a22_11']	以無因故，如虛空等，非一邊故。	以無因故，如虛空等，非一邊故。	004	Because it has no cause, like space, etc., it is not one-sided.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144a23_5']	此說非彼因性可得，本性無體故。	此說非彼因性可得，本性無體故。	004	This explanation cannot be obtained as their causal nature, because the inherent nature has no substance.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144a24_5']	雖瓶等有因，而非意中謂彼一向有體可成。	雖瓶等有因，而非意中謂彼一向有體可成。	004	Although pots and so forth have causes, they are not established as having a real substance in the mind.

['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144a25_13']	既非同生性，彼即非道理。	既非同生性，彼即非道理。	004	Since they are not of the same nature as arising, they are not in accordance with reason.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144a26_8']	又若分別虛空等，常非一切所向。	又若分別虛空等，常非一切所向。	004	Moreover, if one discriminates space and so forth as permanent, it is not directed towards everything.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144a27_12']	以虛空等方分分別，若或別異有性可立者，故頌遣言：	以虛空等方分分別，若或別異有性可立者，故頌遣言：	004	Because space and so forth are discriminated as having spatial divisions, if there is a nature that can be established as separate or different, the verse refutes this by saying:
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144a28_14']	「是故於色中，　　離有無分別。	「是故於色中，　　離有無分別。	004	Therefore, within form, one should be free from the discrimination of existence and non-existence.

['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b02_5']	如其分別於諸色中能造所造、若果若因計有體者，皆是諍論安立處所，於自所成中而有相違。	如其分別於諸色中能造所造、若果若因計有體者，皆是諍論安立處所，於自所成中而有相違。	004	If one discriminates and establishes that within all forms, the primary and secondary elements, effects and causes, have real substance, then all of this is a place of established disputes, and there is contradiction within one's own established position.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b02_19']	如佛所言，色處者謂四大所造。	如佛所言，色處者謂四大所造。	004	As the Buddha said, the sense base of form refers to what is created by the four great elements.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b03_18']	彼能造義，即因義成，應知所說非勝義諦。	彼能造義，即因義成，應知所說非勝義諦。	004	The meaning of what can create is established as the meaning of cause, and one should know that what is said is not ultimate truth.

['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b06_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	004	The explanation says:
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b07_18']	彼諸大種堅濕暖動自性而不可見，非彼自性色有所得，是故非諸大種與果和合。	彼諸大種堅濕暖動自性而不可見，非彼自性色有所得，是故非諸大種與果和合。	004	Those great elements such as solidity, moisture, heat, and movement are by nature invisible, and their nature is not something that can be obtained through form. Therefore, the great elements do not combine with the effect.

['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b11_20']	若不相似性，即無果可成，止其果性故。	若不相似性，即無果可成，止其果性故。	004	If there is no similarity in nature, then there can be no effect accomplished, because it stops the nature of the effect.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b12_8']	受等多義亦同此說。	受等多義亦同此說。	004	The many meanings such as feeling are also explained in the same way.

['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b18_7']	謂離諸因即不可得，以眼色等因諸有分位彼彼無實因性所成。	謂離諸因即不可得，以眼色等因諸有分位彼彼無實因性所成。	004	It means that apart from causes, they cannot be obtained. Because the various states of the eyes, forms, and so forth are not established by any real causal nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_004:0144b19_6']	若或離彼無實因性，是中亦無少法可得。	若或離彼無實因性，是中亦無少法可得。	004	If they are apart from that real causal nature, then in this case there is also no dharma that can be obtained.
