If we absolutely want to make this have a separate meaning, we must make an interpretation that is free of error. That is, although anger, like craving, has many categories, it can be generally referred to as a single latent tendency.

Therefore, there are those who consider it to be true liberation. The Buddha refutes the notion of true liberation, and therefore establishes the name existence in the higher realms. Craving for the two higher realms is called craving for existence.

Those sentient beings mostly deeply delight in samādhi and its basis, and therefore it is said that they only delight in the self and not in objects, because they are free from craving for desire. For this reason, only they are called craving for existence.

This means that it has already been said that both samādhi and the body are called the self that is associated with the name.

There is no holy teaching that speaks of the existence of craving only in the realms of form and non-form. Therefore, the difficulty is based on faith.

Why not say that the term “craving” is used with regard to objects? The latent tendency of craving in the realm of desire should not be established separately.

However, within these five aggregates that are grasped, the latent tendencies of conceit and craving for self have not yet been eliminated. In reality, there is only conceit and craving for self in the higher aggregates that are grasped.
