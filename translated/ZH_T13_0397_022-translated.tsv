Due to the causes and conditions of Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, they expounded the Dharma of the voice-hearers, mixed with the four noble truths.
['ZH_T13_0397_022:0154a22_8']	爾時，眾中有諸人輩，本是外道，諸根闇鈍自謂有智，起大憍慢，增長色慢、欲慢、無明慢、勝慢、非法慢，未得第二第三第四沙門果證。	爾時，眾中有諸人輩，本是外道，諸根闇鈍自謂有智，起大憍慢，增長色慢、欲慢、無明慢、勝慢、非法慢，未得第二第三第四沙門果證。	At that time, there were people in the assembly who were originally non-Buddhists.

In what they have not attained, they give rise to the thought of attainment. In what they do not know, they give rise to the thought of knowing. Within the Tathāgata's teachings, they do not practice.
