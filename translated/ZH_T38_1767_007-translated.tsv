['ZH_T38_1767_007:0075b16_5']	寢臥床席者，沈空滯寂失遊戲神通。	寢臥床席者，沈空滯寂失遊戲神通。	007	As for lying on a bed, sinking in emptiness and stagnating in quiescence loses the spiritual powers of play.

Because of little truth, it is called weak. Because of not being superior cultivation, it is called inferior. The remaining life is almost gone, about to enter into annihilation.
['ZH_T38_1767_007:0075b20_14']	次「有一富人者」下，譬如來不應付囑。	次「有一富人者」下，譬如來不應付囑。	007	Next, from There was a wealthy person below, it is a simile for the Tathāgata not entrusting [the Dharma] to others.
['ZH_T38_1767_007:0075b21_3']	智斷圓滿故言富人。	智斷圓滿故言富人。	007	Because of the perfection of wisdom and elimination, it is said to be a wealthy person.
['ZH_T38_1767_007:0075b22_7']	緣事欲行者，適化多務故言緣事，乘如起應故言欲行。	緣事欲行者，適化多務故言緣事，乘如起應故言欲行。	007	On business, about to depart means that because of adapting to the transformations, there are many tasks, so it is said to be on business. Riding the suchness to give rise to response is called about to depart.
