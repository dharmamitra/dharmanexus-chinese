['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b07_19']	此何意耶？	此何意耶？	What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b09_12']	欲明所有一切眾生悉皆攝同菩薩，己身由斯但是寂滅，己身無別有情也。	欲明所有一切眾生悉皆攝同菩薩，己身由斯但是寂滅，己身無別有情也。	It clarifies that all sentient beings are all included in the same as the bodhisattva's own body. Because of this, it is only quiescent extinction, and there are no separate sentient beings.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b10_12']	若作別有眾生不為己想者，此即不名菩薩。	若作別有眾生不為己想者，此即不名菩薩。	If one makes separate sentient beings and does not think of them as one's own, then one is not called a bodhisattva.

['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b15_13']	此即由依有身見故我等想生，為令正斷是不顛倒，次下當顯諸有發趣菩薩乘者應如是修行。	此即由依有身見故我等想生，為令正斷是不顛倒，次下當顯諸有發趣菩薩乘者應如是修行。	This is because the thought of self and so forth arises based on the view of a real self.

Due to the absence of weariness, one is diligent; having understood the minds of others, one is concentrated; and one proclaims the true Dharma with wisdom.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b25_3']	此是大菩薩修行之處，即是以一施聲收盡六度。	此是大菩薩修行之處，即是以一施聲收盡六度。	This is the place of practice for great bodhisattvas, and it is precisely by means of the single term giving that the six perfections are completely encompassed.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b26_11']	經云「菩薩不住於事，應行布施」如是等者，此中何謂不住性耶？	經云「菩薩不住於事，應行布施」如是等者，此中何謂不住性耶？	The sutra says, Bodhisattvas should practice giving without abiding in things. What is meant by the nature of non-abiding here?
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b26_14']	頌曰：	頌曰：	A verse says:

['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b28_20']	言「不住於事」者，此顯不著自身、不住隨處。	言「不住於事」者，此顯不著自身、不住隨處。	As for the phrase not dwelling on things, this shows non-attachment to one's own body and not dwelling on the circumstances.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875b29_18']	「應行布施」者，此顯不著報恩於利養恭敬等。	「應行布施」者，此顯不著報恩於利養恭敬等。	As for the phrase one should practice giving, this shows non-attachment to repaying kindness and to gain and respect, etc.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c02_4']	求恩望益之處事有多途，故云不應隨處生著而行布施。	求恩望益之處事有多途，故云不應隨處生著而行布施。	The circumstances of seeking kindness and expecting benefits are many, therefore it is said that one should not give rise to attachment to the circumstances and practice giving.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c02_19']	「不住於色」等者，謂不著果報。	「不住於色」等者，謂不著果報。	As for the phrase not dwelling on form, etc., this refers to non-attachment to the fruits and retributions.

['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c03_8']	何須如是行不住施耶？	何須如是行不住施耶？	Why is it necessary to practice giving in this way without dwelling?
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c03_11']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c04_13']	為離於不起，　　及離為餘行。	為離於不起，　　及離為餘行。	In order to avoid not giving rise to it, and to avoid giving for other practices.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c06_7']	由顧自身不行其施，為欲離其不起心故，莫著自身速應行施。	由顧自身不行其施，為欲離其不起心故，莫著自身速應行施。	Because of caring for one's own body, one does not practice giving. In order to avoid the mind not giving rise to it, one should not be attached to one's own body and quickly practice giving.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c08_5']	由望恩心及悕果故，遂捨正覺菩提果性，為於餘事而行惠施，是故當捨求餘行施。	由望恩心及悕果故，遂捨正覺菩提果性，為於餘事而行惠施，是故當捨求餘行施。	Because of the mind expecting kindness and hoping for results, one abandons the nature of the fruit of right enlightenment and bodhi, and practices giving for other things. Therefore, one should abandon seeking to give for other practices.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c08_13']	次下當說攝伏心。	次下當說攝伏心。	The following will explain the method of subduing the mind.

['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c13_7']	經云「菩薩如是應行布施乃至相想亦不應著」，此顯所捨之物及所施眾生并能施者，於此三處除著想心。	經云「菩薩如是應行布施乃至相想亦不應著」，此顯所捨之物及所施眾生并能施者，於此三處除著想心。	The sūtra says, Bodhisattvas should practice giving like this, and should not even be attached to the thought of characteristics. This shows that one should eliminate the thought of attachment to the three things: the objects to be given away, the sentient beings to whom one gives, and the one who gives.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c13_14']	次明布施利益。	次明布施利益。	Next, it clarifies the benefits of giving.

['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c17_13']	為顯若人不著相想，方能行彼不著施也。	為顯若人不著相想，方能行彼不著施也。	It is to show that if a person is not attached to characteristics, they can then practice giving without attachment.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c18_12']	從此已後所有經文，皆為除遣後後疑惑。	從此已後所有經文，皆為除遣後後疑惑。	From here on, all the subsequent sutra text is to dispel doubts one after another.

['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c20_7']	若不著於法而行施者，如何為求正覺勝果行惠施耶？	若不著於法而行施者，如何為求正覺勝果行惠施耶？	If one does not become attached to the Dharma when practicing giving, how does one practice giving in order to seek the supreme fruit of perfect enlightenment?
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c21_1']	為答此疑，經云「於汝意云何？	為答此疑，經云「於汝意云何？	In order to answer this doubt, the sutra says, What do you think?
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c21_16']	可以勝相觀如來不」，如是廣說。	可以勝相觀如來不」，如是廣說。	Can one see the Tathagata through his excellent characteristics? and so on, explaining in detail.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c21_19']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c22_0']	若將為集造，　　妙相非勝相，	若將為集造，　　妙相非勝相，	If one takes the creation of the excellent characteristics as the collection, they are not the excellent characteristics,
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c23_13']	三相遷異故，　　無此謂如來。	三相遷異故，　　無此謂如來。	Because they are subject to the three characteristics of change. There is no such thing as the Tathagata.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c25_14']	若謂如來是由施等因緣所造，於有為相中得最勝性者，便見如來有其勝相。	若謂如來是由施等因緣所造，於有為相中得最勝性者，便見如來有其勝相。	If one says that the Tathagata is created by the causes and conditions of giving and so forth, and attains the nature of supremacy among conditioned things, then one sees the Tathagata as having excellent characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c27_17']	若望如來真如之性，即無此勝相，是故不應以勝妙相觀於如來，由彼法身是非集造之所顯故。	若望如來真如之性，即無此勝相，是故不應以勝妙相觀於如來，由彼法身是非集造之所顯故。	If one regards the true nature of the Tathagata, then there are no such excellent characteristics. Therefore, one should not see the Tathagata through excellent and wonderful characteristics, because that Dharma body is not manifested by what is created through accumulation.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0875c28_5']	次云「何以故？	次云「何以故？	Next, it says, Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a01_1']	如來說彼勝相三相遷異故，由此勝相即非勝相」，此中意說三相之體是遷流故。	如來說彼勝相三相遷異故，由此勝相即非勝相」，此中意說三相之體是遷流故。	The Tathāgata says that those superior characteristics are subject to the three characteristics of change. Therefore, those superior characteristics are not superior characteristics. The meaning here is that the essence of the three characteristics is subject to change and flow.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a01_5']	「妙生！	「妙生！	Subhūti!
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a03_2']	所有勝相皆是虛妄，是故應以勝相非相觀於如來」，此意欲明從因生法是虛假故無。	所有勝相皆是虛妄，是故應以勝相非相觀於如來」，此意欲明從因生法是虛假故無。	All superior characteristics are false. Therefore, one should view the Tathāgata with superior characteristics that are not characteristics. This meaning intends to clarify that dharmas produced from causes are false and nonexistent.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a04_7']	此謂如來由彼全無三種相故，由離此相即以無相為相。	此謂如來由彼全無三種相故，由離此相即以無相為相。	This means that because the Tathāgata is completely devoid of the three kinds of characteristics, by being apart from these characteristics, he is characterized by being without characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a06_5']	「若於是處無生住滅變異之性可了知」者，此顯如來不是有為造作之性因緣所成。	「若於是處無生住滅變異之性可了知」者，此顯如來不是有為造作之性因緣所成。	If in this place there is no nature of birth, abiding, cessation, or change that can be known, this shows that the Tathāgata is not a nature that is produced by conditioned arising.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a07_15']	如是明解如來性已，雖為佛果而行布施非著法施，即是除去疑情。	如是明解如來性已，雖為佛果而行布施非著法施，即是除去疑情。	Thus, having clearly understood the nature of the Tathāgata, although one practices giving for the sake of the fruition of Buddhahood, one is not attached to giving the Dharma, which is precisely removing doubts.
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a08_5']	次下妙生重生疑念：	次下妙生重生疑念：	Next, Subhūti gives rise to doubts again:
['ZH_T25_1513_001:0876a09_3']	若由如是行無住施者，即因極甚深；	若由如是行無住施者，即因極甚深；	If one practices giving without attachment in this way, then the cause is extremely profound;
