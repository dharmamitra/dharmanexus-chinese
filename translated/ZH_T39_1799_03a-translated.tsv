If discussed in detail, the clear eyes are likened to the nature of enlightenment. Due to the sudden appearance of fatigue, ignorance is not understood, so it becomes thought-movement. Due to the appearance of fatigue, one sees flowers in the sky, which is likened to the manifestation of deluded sense objects and the body due to the movement of thought.

Fatigue refers to the manifested faculties, sense objects, and the seeing mind. This mind, sense objects, and moving thoughts are all the ignorant fatigued appearances within the nature of the bodhisattva. They have no substance to be found. They arise falsely, just like seeing flowers in the sky due to staring. They are both fatigue.

['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860b20_17']	」既因動心現妄境界，於此妄境派成根塵，互為對待相形而立，本無自性，體不可得。	」既因動心現妄境界，於此妄境派成根塵，互為對待相形而立，本無自性，體不可得。	03a	Since deluded objects are manifested by the moving mind, within these deluded objects, faculties and objects are divided, mutually serving as supports for each other, and thus established. They originally have no self-nature and cannot be apprehended.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860b22_1']	下文云「由塵發知，因根有相，相見無性，猶如交蘆。	下文云「由塵發知，因根有相，相見無性，猶如交蘆。	03a	The text below says, Consciousness arises due to objects, and form exists due to faculties. Form and seeing have no nature, just like two bundles of reeds supporting each other.

Once faculties and objects are complete, the nature of seeing is formed. Therefore, it says absorbing this is called the nature of seeing, and so forth.

The manifesting consciousness is also like this. According to the five sense objects, when they come into contact, it immediately manifests.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860b27_14']	」明暗尚如影象無體可得，況所發見而有體耶？	」明暗尚如影象無體可得，況所發見而有體耶？	03a	Even light and darkness are like shadows and images without any substance to be found, let alone the seeing that arises having any substance?
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860b28_2']	故云離彼無體。	故云離彼無體。	03a	Therefore, it is said that apart from them, there is no substance.

['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c02_15']	」前文雖云因于明暗，為顯根性本無，假他而有，就妄分別而似有因。	」前文雖云因于明暗，為顯根性本無，假他而有，就妄分別而似有因。	03a	Although the previous text says it is caused by light and darkness, it is to show that the nature of the faculties is originally non-existent, and only exists provisionally based on others, and from the perspective of false discrimination, it seems to have causes.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c03_12']	今以四處推窮，體無生處，故此標也。	今以四處推窮，體無生處，故此標也。	03a	Now, by investigating the four locations, the substance has no place of arising, therefore this is indicated.

['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c04_4', 'ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c04_19']	「何以故？🔽若從明來，暗即隨滅，應非見暗。	「何以故？ 若從明來，暗即隨滅，應非見暗。	03a	Why is it so?🔽If it comes from light, darkness would immediately cease, and it should not see darkness.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c05_12']	若從暗來，明即隨滅，應無見明。	若從暗來，明即隨滅，應無見明。	03a	If it comes from darkness, light would immediately cease, and it should not see light.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c06_1']	若從根生，必無明暗。	若從根生，必無明暗。	03a	If it arises from the faculties, it must be without light and darkness.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c06_10']	如是見精本無自性。	如是見精本無自性。	03a	Thus, the seeing essence is originally without self-nature.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c07_6']	若於空出，前矚塵像，歸當見根。	若於空出，前矚塵像，歸當見根。	03a	If it emerges from space, when it first encounters the images of objects, it should return to the seeing faculty.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c07_16']	又空自觀，何關汝入？	又空自觀，何關汝入？	03a	Moreover, space itself observes, so what does it have to do with your sense faculties?
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c09_15']	」初破境生，境中自有明暗相背，因明即不見暗，以暗時無明，見隨明滅故，因暗反此。	」初破境生，境中自有明暗相背，因明即不見暗，以暗時無明，見隨明滅故，因暗反此。	03a	First, refuting that it arises from the objects. Within the objects, light and darkness are mutually exclusive. Due to light, one does not see darkness. When it is dark, there is no light, and seeing ceases with the disappearance of light. The opposite is the case due to darkness.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c10_17']	次破根生，根生即不假明暗，明暗不來，根無自性。	次破根生，根生即不假明暗，明暗不來，根無自性。	03a	Next, refuting that it arises from the faculties. If it arises from the faculties, it would not depend on light and darkness. Without light and darkness coming, the faculties have no self-nature.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c12_8']	此中言根生者，以自望自，非謂破識，亦可勝義望世俗根，故云根生。	此中言根生者，以自望自，非謂破識，亦可勝義望世俗根，故云根生。	03a	Here, saying it arises from the faculties means that it arises from the faculties themselves, not that it refutes the consciousness. It can also be said that the ultimate truth regards the faculties of the conventional truth as arising from the faculties.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c13_16']	次破空生，若言虛空能生，勝義在浮塵內，進既觀像，退應觀根。	次破空生，若言虛空能生，勝義在浮塵內，進既觀像，退應觀根。	03a	Next, refuting that it arises from space. If it is said that space can give rise to it, the ultimate truth is within the floating dust. When advancing, it should observe the images; when retreating, it should observe the faculties.
['ZH_T39_1799_03a:0860c14_13']	又空中自能有見，何關汝之眼入？	又空中自能有見，何關汝之眼入？	03a	Moreover, space itself can have seeing. What does it have to do with your eye sense faculty?

Because the ear faculty is strained, sounds are produced in the head. The ears and the strain are the same in being the appearances of the straining of bodhi.

The sense organ and the object depend on each other for the hearing to be accomplished. Therefore, this ear sense organ has no substance apart from the dust.
