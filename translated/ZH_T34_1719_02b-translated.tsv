['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0179b05_1']	非聖全不交凡名之為絕，如以凡望凡交者方識，況以凡望聖理合絕交，交好既絕，豈以識之多少言耶？	非聖全不交凡名之為絕，如以凡望凡交者方識，況以凡望聖理合絕交，交好既絕，豈以識之多少言耶？	02b	It is not that sages completely do not interact with ordinary people, but it is called no interaction because those who interact are only those who are recognized as ordinary people. How much more so is it appropriate for ordinary people to have no interaction with sages? Since interaction and fondness are already cut off, how can one speak of them in terms of the quantity of those who know and recognize them?
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0179b08_5']	「特以」等者，今聖為引凡發彼同類，機緣不等隨類接之，故現少識之迹以接隱德之徒，故不以凡夫能知能識而判所知所識位高下也。	「特以」等者，今聖為引凡發彼同類，機緣不等隨類接之，故現少識之迹以接隱德之徒，故不以凡夫能知能識而判所知所識位高下也。	02b	As for in particular, now sages lead ordinary people to give rise to their own kind, and the conditions of the various types are not equal, so they connect with them according to their type. Therefore, they manifest traces of having few acquaintances in order to connect with those with hidden virtues. Therefore, they do not judge the high and low positions of those who can know and recognize them based on whether ordinary people can know and recognize them.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0179b10_5']	故言不可以多少之迹失其本，故不可以多人知識為本高、以少人知識為本下。	故言不可以多少之迹失其本，故不可以多人知識為本高、以少人知識為本下。	02b	Therefore, it is said that the basis cannot be lost due to the number of traces, and therefore the basis cannot be considered high because of being known by many people, or low because of being known by few people.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0179b12_13']	又不可多知識者為有實本、少知識者為無實本，故知多識少識俱迹而別有理本，若久本者自有實成。	又不可多知識者為有實本、少知識者為無實本，故知多識少識俱迹而別有理本，若久本者自有實成。	02b	Moreover, those with many acquaintances cannot be considered to have a real basis, and those with few acquaintances cannot be considered to lack a real basis. Therefore, it is known that many acquaintances and few acquaintances are both traces, but there is a separate principle basis. If it is a long-standing basis, it will naturally be truly accomplished.

Although one who has initially entered the stage of effortless practice can be called a post-learner, it is only a partial attainment, so it is further distinguished based on completeness.

Those who return seven times, once-returners, and non-returners all do not learn again. If one progresses through the fruits, the meaning belongs to the previous statement. Moreover, what has already been cut off is not to be cut off again, which also corresponds to the fourth statement.

The first two sentences are the same as before. The last two sentences are because they study and abide in their own stage. As for the arhats, the Buddha also abides in wholesome dharmas, which is studying as a non-learner.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0179c02_19']	若準羅漢，佛亦住於善法，為無學學。	若準羅漢，佛亦住於善法，為無學學。	02b	If based on the arhats, the Buddha also abides in wholesome dharmas, which is studying as a non-learner.

It can be understood by analogy with the common teaching.

Both the separate and perfect teachings take the stage of incompleteness. Among them, there are also ancient Buddhas, which are the non-learner people of the second section.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0179c08_11']	又「滿」字者，滿通三教簡二從圓。	又「滿」字者，滿通三教簡二從圓。	02b	Also, the full character means that completeness is common to the three teachings, distinguishing the two and taking the perfect.

At that time, it was already the adornment of non-duality, but beginners clung to the traces and obscured the origin. Only when they arrived at the Lotus Sutra and Nirvana Sutra was it finally revealed. It is like the Sutra of Great Final Nirvana mentioning the six people as causes, who, upon seeing the Buddha-nature, became the same as the Tathagata, with duality being non-dual, thus called adornment.

Two more phrases should be established: not contemplating yet contemplating is called no-learning learning, always contemplating like this is called learning no-learning. In contrast to those who have not yet cultivated, it forms the fifth phrase. It can also be used as the fifth phrase in terms of principle. Each of the three contemplations can also be used as five phrases. It can be seen by thinking about it.

The hundred realms and thousand suchnesses only form one thousand, which is the ten realms and hundred realms, with each realm having ten suchnesses. It should also be further discussed with the hundred suchnesses and thousand realms.

For example, if the first and last of the ten suchnesses are present, then the ten suchnesses become one hundred. Using this to correspond to the ten realms, wouldn't it be one thousand realms?

Therefore, the first two sections simply list the numbers.

The two characters corresponding are pronounced with the departing tone, so they jointly clarify the inherent and revealed, and contemplation of the mind, because the causes and conditions cannot be combined and explained, and the teachings and principles should be mutually inclusive. Now, wanting to discuss the host and companions, the inherent and revealed, and contemplation of the mind, is convenient.

The contemplation of the mind is not jointly clarified because their appearance and clothing are distant, there is no beginning and end, they are not weighty to beings, and it is not for the sake of the sūtra's distinction.

The related causes and conditions must be set up together. Sometimes one person is related to many people, and many people are related to one person. Sometimes one person is related to one, and many people are related to many.

There is not a single sage who does not accord with the capacities and conditions of beings, so it is called curved and skillful. There is not a single mental state that does not become a wonderful contemplation, so it is called subtle and refined. Following capacities is curved, and guiding forward is skillful.

At that time, who would say that the aggregates have not yet been exhausted, the pure life has not yet been established, and what is to be done has not yet been accomplished, and there is still transformation?

The twenty mental factors assist the mind king in relating to wholesome objects. Like initially giving rise to contemplation, it is inseparable from the mind and mental factors. The general mental factors are still general, generally reaching wholesome objects. Using this great wholesome [mind] to experience conditions and relate to objects, the wholesome becomes increasingly profound, like reaching the present sutra. Therefore, these wholesome mental factors have no separate mind substance, but simply transform the unwholesome mental factors to arise. Therefore, from externally entering the small, from the small entering the great, from beginning to end it is called the ultimate wholesome. Although wholesome practices are many, they do not go beyond these ten, thus it is said that the ten wholesome mental states are the basis.

If one wishes to briefly distinguish the similarities and differences by matching the old names, the new translation says faith, which means to acquiesce in the three jewels, which is the same as the old name and meaning.

Now, the focus is on entering contemplation through the names, so the good king and good number together guide the various evils to become wonderful goodness. Therefore, the mind that assists the king is also like this. As for using the number to correspond to the people according to their characteristics, it should also be understandable.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0181c24_4']	十人既爾，以十望諸乃至無數，不出心所，何但一萬二千乃至未受化來，以惡心所攝之亦盡，何但善及通耶？	十人既爾，以十望諸乃至無數，不出心所，何但一萬二千乃至未受化來，以惡心所攝之亦盡，何但善及通耶？	02b	Since it is like this for the ten people, from ten to innumerable, they are not beyond the mental factors. How can it be only ten thousand two thousand, and so on, up to those who have not yet received guidance?

It should also be further said that they arise in sequence.

If one mind changes, the others follow along. If they mutually support each other in turning, they all enter the real realm together. There is nothing that is not the true king, and the king and the numbers are not distinguished. Therefore, know that according to the person, whichever is biased and strong is taken as the object of contemplation, and the weak ones follow along. Wonderfully attaining this meaning, in the four deportments and three karmas, cultivating contemplation has a basis. Moreover, being able to contemplate, one must distinguish the differences and similarities?

If one conceives of a subject of contemplation, it is called the mind of self, and because there is the mind of self, subject and object are not eliminated.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0182a10_9']	我所若空，罪福無主。	我所若空，罪福無主。	02b	If the object of self is empty, then there is no doer of good and evil.

Therefore, it is only called complete upon reaching wondrous enlightenment.

It is like the five skandhas, where cause and effect have the same name but their substance is eternally separate.

If the mind of the object of contemplation does not transform sentient beings, then the subject of contemplation, the king, numbers, teacher, and disciple will not cease.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0182a17_8']	「云云」者，廣明王數能觀所觀，訖與不訖、成不成相，正覺之名又通諸地等。	「云云」者，廣明王數能觀所觀，訖與不訖、成不成相，正覺之名又通諸地等。	02b	And so on means extensively clarifying the king, numbers, subject of contemplation, object of contemplation, whether it is complete or not, the characteristics of success or failure, and the name of right enlightenment also applies to various stages, etc.

If we rely on the present text, first we should recognize the existence or non-existence of the common and separate parts of the various schools, and then we will understand the meaning of listing the assemblies in the present sutra.

Moreover, the five flavors are all judged to be bodhisattvas, therefore using curd to correspond to the common teaching, the two kinds of butter to correspond to the distinct teaching, and ghee to correspond to the perfect teaching. Because the various bodhisattvas go through these four flavors and enter the indeterminate, the meaning corresponds to the three contemplations:
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0182b27_12']	即三藏菩薩轉入通時，義當於酪，據時並在方等已前；	即三藏菩薩轉入通時，義當於酪，據時並在方等已前；	02b	When the bodhisattvas of the Tripiṭaka Teaching enter into the Shared Teaching, it corresponds to the stage of curds, and in terms of time, it is before the Vaipulya period;

This seems to be a common stage, so it is difficult for it to not become the meaning of the separate teaching. It is the same for the difficulty with the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c03_12']	若言七地始入無功用道，此是別教教道明義，故不成圓。	若言七地始入無功用道，此是別教教道明義，故不成圓。	02b	If it is said that the seventh ground begins to enter the path of effortless function, this is the meaning of the teaching path of the separate teaching, so it does not become perfect.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c04_10']	言「進退」等者，斥進不成圓、退非通別。	言「進退」等者，斥進不成圓、退非通別。	02b	As for the phrase advancing and retreating, it criticizes advancing as not being perfect and retreating as not being common or specific.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c05_13']	今文「橫豎」者，豎歎赴情意本在圓，先正釋，次料簡。	今文「橫豎」者，豎歎赴情意本在圓，先正釋，次料簡。	02b	As for the phrase horizontal and vertical in the current text, the vertical praise of responding to emotions is originally in the perfect teaching. First, it is correctly explained, and then it is analyzed.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c09_15']	然初豎中初文雖借離二之名，須異《瓔珞》二為方便，還依一念具三不退以為初地，圓離三垢、圓發三智，圓明圓轉，一念供養，圓植德本為佛圓歎，具圓三慈不二佛慧下去準知。	然初豎中初文雖借離二之名，須異《瓔珞》二為方便，還依一念具三不退以為初地，圓離三垢、圓發三智，圓明圓轉，一念供養，圓植德本為佛圓歎，具圓三慈不二佛慧下去準知。	02b	However, in the initial vertical section, although the name of leaving the two is borrowed, it must be different from the two in the Yiqie jing as skillful means. It still relies on the three non-retrogressions in a single thought to be the initial ground, perfectly leaving the three defilements, perfectly giving rise to the three knowledges, perfectly illuminating and perfectly turning, making offerings in a single thought, perfectly planting the root of virtue to be praised by the perfect Buddha, possessing the perfect three kinds of compassion and the non-dual Buddha wisdom. The following should be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c11_6']	若不開等覺則四句同歎十地，今從開說，故後三句歎於等覺。	若不開等覺則四句同歎十地，今從開說，故後三句歎於等覺。	02b	If the stage of equal enlightenment is not opened, then the four phrases praise the ten grounds equally. Now, following the opening, the last three phrases praise the stage of equal enlightenment.

['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c13_4']	但不從初即具，故似別耳。	但不從初即具，故似別耳。	02b	It is just that it is not complete from the beginning, so it seems separate.

['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c19_12']	立宗意者，斷惑也。	立宗意者，斷惑也。	02b	The meaning of the proposition is to sever delusions.

The Tripiṭaka bodhisattvas do not sever delusions from beginning to end, and may not be praised there.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c22_16']	於斷惑中尚歎二乘，迹為通別斷惑菩薩何得不歎，而橫豎二歎悉唯歎圓。	於斷惑中尚歎二乘，迹為通別斷惑菩薩何得不歎，而橫豎二歎悉唯歎圓。	02b	In the section on severing delusions, he still praises the Two Vehicles. For the bodhisattvas who sever delusions through the Shared and Distinct [Teachings], why would he not praise them? Yet the two praises, horizontal and vertical, are all praises of the Perfect [Teaching].
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0183c26_14']	答意者，義通本迹、意唯在圓，豎文似歎於別，依部唯歎於圓，借迹消文經意從本，故準歎聲聞從迹，亦應菩薩四教俱歎，但欲知圓旨故亡迹以存本及去初而取後。	答意者，義通本迹、意唯在圓，豎文似歎於別，依部唯歎於圓，借迹消文經意從本，故準歎聲聞從迹，亦應菩薩四教俱歎，但欲知圓旨故亡迹以存本及去初而取後。	02b	The meaning of the answer is that the meaning extends to the original and traces, but the intention is only in the Perfect [Teaching]. The vertical text seems to praise the Distinct [Teaching], but based on the sutra, it only praises the Perfect [Teaching]. Borrowing the traces to explain the text, the meaning of the sutra follows the original, therefore, the praise of the śrāvakas is based on the traces. It should also be that for the bodhisattvas, all four teachings are praised. But in order to know the purport of the Perfect [Teaching], the traces are forgotten to preserve the original, and the beginning is discarded to take the end.

Since the stages of the eight grounds are not yet ultimate, the old explanations still possess virtues without doubt.

The two phrases of making offerings and planting merit are combined as the fourth demonstration, and the two phrases of fame and saving beings are combined as the tenth demonstration, thus forming ten demonstrations, all named after irreversibility.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0184a09_12']	故知圓釋句句互通，一一示現具十示現、具一切諸句，何但十示現十二句耶？	故知圓釋句句互通，一一示現具十示現、具一切諸句，何但十示現十二句耶？	02b	Therefore, it is known that the perfect explanation of each phrase mutually penetrates, and each demonstration is endowed with ten demonstrations and all the phrases, not just ten demonstrations and twelve phrases.

The reason the sutra text briefly cultivates the mind is because kindness is the mind, and the mind perfuming the body, it is not separately explained.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0184a13_8']	乃至依我空法空不退，故知地住俱證二空。	乃至依我空法空不退，故知地住俱證二空。	02b	Up to relying on emptiness of self and emptiness of dharmas, one does not regress. Therefore, it is known that the grounds and abodes both realize the two emptinesses.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0184a16_16']	所以豎釋文雖別對意非別者，一者以有次文橫釋是約豎論橫，二者依《論》句句義意以對諸地，如初地云不墮二邊三觀具足，自利利他有無雙照。	所以豎釋文雖別對意非別者，一者以有次文橫釋是約豎論橫，二者依《論》句句義意以對諸地，如初地云不墮二邊三觀具足，自利利他有無雙照。	02b	The reason for the vertical explanation, although the text is different, the meaning is not different, is first, because there is a subsequent horizontal explanation, which is about the vertical discussing the horizontal. Second, relying on the treatise, the meaning of each phrase is used to correspond with the various grounds. For example, the first ground says not falling into the two extremes, fully endowed with the three contemplations, benefiting oneself and benefiting others, the double illumination of existence and non-existence.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0184a17_15']	若福若智不離一心，內因外緣何嘗不具？	若福若智不離一心，內因外緣何嘗不具？	02b	Whether it is merit or wisdom, it is not apart from the one mind. How could the internal causes and external conditions ever not be complete?

The horizontal and vertical are fully contained within this ground. It is in response to the sequential provisional borrowing of the ground names, in order to reveal the sole perfect. Those require a horizontal explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_02b:0184a22_4']	故《論》中攝取事門即當豎釋，是故今文具用《論》中二門解釋，但今文中準《論》，於何等境界下剩「何等」二字。	故《論》中攝取事門即當豎釋，是故今文具用《論》中二門解釋，但今文中準《論》，於何等境界下剩「何等」二字。	02b	Therefore, in the treatise, the gate of encompassing activities corresponds to the horizontal explanation. Therefore, the present text fully uses the two gates in the treatise to explain, but in the present text, according to the treatise, below what kind of realm, the two characters what kind of are added.

The following explains it in terms of events, taking what is received as sound. This explains it in terms of the ability to contemplate, taking what is proclaimed as sound. Because of the contemplation, the teaching is established, so it is said that contemplation is the basis of speech.
