['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017b11_4']	密義者，佛若不說，偏小不知，故名密義。	密義者，佛若不說，偏小不知，故名密義。	The secret meaning is that if the Buddha did not speak, the biased and small would not know, thus it is called the secret meaning.

Now discussing this meaning, it is said to reveal the secret meaning of the Tathāgata's skillful means.

['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017b28_2']	無翻五者，以彼語多含、此方單淺，不可以單翻複，應留本音。	無翻五者，以彼語多含、此方單淺，不可以單翻複，應留本音。	The five meanings of not having a translation are that their language contains many meanings, while in this land it is single and shallow, so it cannot be translated single for complex, and should retain the original sound.

['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017c03_16']	昔佛法初度梵漢未明，故有無翻之說，乃是河西群學所傳，晚人承用耳。	昔佛法初度梵漢未明，故有無翻之說，乃是河西群學所傳，晚人承用耳。	In the past, when Buddhism first arrived, the Sanskrit and Chinese were not yet clear, so there were teachings that were not translated. This was transmitted by the scholars of Hexi, and later people followed it.
['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017c05_9']	有翻之家雖具五義，以經為正，以此方先聖之語悉名經，故以佛語為經。	有翻之家雖具五義，以經為正，以此方先聖之語悉名經，故以佛語為經。	Although the translation school has five meanings, it takes sūtra as the main one. Because the words of the sages of this land are all called sūtras, the words of the Buddha are taken as sūtras.

['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017c13_1']	後名中諦，遮照不二故大，故云又名不思議等。	後名中諦，遮照不二故大，故云又名不思議等。	Later, it is called the truth of the middle way, which is great because concealment and illumination are non-dual, thus it says it is also called inconceivable, etc.
['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017c13_19']	不因小相者，虛空絕待，非對小名大也。	不因小相者，虛空絕待，非對小名大也。	Not depending on small characteristics means empty space is beyond comparison, not that it is called great in contrast to small.
['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017c14_8']	二、約真俗中俱名滅也。	二、約真俗中俱名滅也。	Second, it is about both the true and conventional being called cessation.

['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017c22_4']	三諦無著悉是過越，咸得度名。	三諦無著悉是過越，咸得度名。	The three truths are unattached and all surpass, all attaining the name of transcendence.

['ZH_T38_1766_001:0017c24_9']	不著雙照故云度。	不著雙照故云度。	Not being attached to the double illumination is called transcendence.

If they are placed side by side, it does not form 'i', and if they are placed vertically, it also does not form. Only when it is like the three eyes on the face of Maheśvara does it form 'i'.

['ZH_T38_1766_001:0018a10_1']	總既含別、別不離總，故體即是大，宗即是度，用即是滅，教相分別總別之三法耳，是故五章不出三法。	總既含別、別不離總，故體即是大，宗即是度，用即是滅，教相分別總別之三法耳，是故五章不出三法。	Since the general includes the specific, and the specific is not apart from the general, therefore the essence is the great, the purport is the crossing, the function is the extinction, and the characteristics of the teaching are the three dharmas of the general and specific. Therefore, the five chapters are not apart from the three dharmas.

Because it contains the three thousand worlds, it is called the treasure trove. Because it is not subject to the changes of the two kinds of death, it is called eternally secure. Because it is free from the three kinds of afflictions and distress, it is called cool and refreshing. Not aging and not dying is precisely eternal and unchanging.
