['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631a18_17']	彼謂諸法行於世時，由類有殊非體有異，如破金器作餘物時，形雖有殊而體無異。	彼謂諸法行於世時，由類有殊非體有異，如破金器作餘物時，形雖有殊而體無異。	052	He says that when dharmas move through the three times, they differ in kind but not in substance. It is like when a gold vessel is destroyed and made into another object, the shape differs but the substance does not.

['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b04_5']	如一女人待前待後，如其次第名女名母。	如一女人待前待後，如其次第名女名母。	052	It is like a single woman who is called a daughter in relation to her mother and a mother in relation to her daughter.

['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b07_5']	此四種說一切有中，傳說最初執法轉變，故應置在數論朋中。	此四種說一切有中，傳說最初執法轉變，故應置在數論朋中。	052	Among the four theories of Sarvāstivāda, it is said that the first theory of the transformation of dharmas should be placed among the Sāṃkhya.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b08_13']	今謂不然，非彼尊者說有為法其體是常，歷三世時法隱法顯。	今謂不然，非彼尊者說有為法其體是常，歷三世時法隱法顯。	052	We now say this is not so. The Venerable One did not say that conditioned dharmas are permanently existent and hidden or manifest at different times in the three periods of time.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b09_12']	但說諸法行於世時，體相雖同而性類異。	但說諸法行於世時，體相雖同而性類異。	052	He only said that when dharmas move through time, although their substance and characteristics are the same, their natures and kinds are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b10_11']	此與尊者世友分同，何容判同數論外道？	此與尊者世友分同，何容判同數論外道？	052	This is the same as the Venerable Vasumitra, so how can it be judged to be the same as the Sāṃkhya non-Buddhist path?
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b14_6']	第二第四立世相雜，故此四中第三最善，以約作用位有差別，由位不同立世有異，如我所辯實有去來，不違法性聖教所許，若撥去來便違法性，毀謗聖教有多過失。	第二第四立世相雜，故此四中第三最善，以約作用位有差別，由位不同立世有異，如我所辯實有去來，不違法性聖教所許，若撥去來便違法性，毀謗聖教有多過失。	052	The second and fourth establish the past and future as mixed with the present, therefore among these four, the third is the best, because it distinguishes the past, present, and future based on the differences in the states of activity. The differences in the states are what distinguish the past, present, and future. As I have explained, the past and future really exist, and do not contradict the nature of dharmas or what is allowed in the holy teachings. If one denies the past and future, then one contradicts the nature of dharmas and slanders the holy teachings, with many faults.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b15_15']	由此應知尊者世友所立實有過去未來，符理順經，無能傾動。	由此應知尊者世友所立實有過去未來，符理順經，無能傾動。	052	From this one should know that the Venerable Vasumitra's establishment that the past and future really exist accords with reason and the sūtras, and cannot be shaken.

['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b19_10']	謂一切行，作用未有名為未來，有作用時名為現在，作用已滅名為過去，非體有殊。	謂一切行，作用未有名為未來，有作用時名為現在，作用已滅名為過去，非體有殊。	052	That is to say, all conditioned dharmas, when their activity has not yet arisen, are called future; when they have activity, they are called present; when their activity has already ceased, they are called past, not because their substance is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b19_19']	此作用名為何所目？	此作用名為何所目？	052	What is the meaning of this function?

['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b21_1']	即餘性生時，能為因性義。	即餘性生時，能為因性義。	052	It is the meaning of being able to serve as a cause when other natures arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b22_10']	若能依此立世有殊，或能作餘無過辯異，智者應許名鑒理人。	若能依此立世有殊，或能作餘無過辯異，智者應許名鑒理人。	052	If one can rely on this to establish the difference in the three periods of time, or if one can make other distinctions without fault, the wise should accept it as a principled person.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b23_17']	若有由迷立世別理，怖他難故棄捨聖言，或了義經撥為不了。	若有由迷立世別理，怖他難故棄捨聖言，或了義經撥為不了。	052	If there are those who, due to confusion, establish a different principle for the three periods of time, fearing the difficulties of others, they abandon the holy teachings, or deny the definitive meaning sutras as being non-definitive.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b26_5']	許有現在言無去來，或許唯現仍是假有，或總非撥三世皆無，此等皆違聖教正理，智者應斥為迷理人。	許有現在言無去來，或許唯現仍是假有，或總非撥三世皆無，此等皆違聖教正理，智者應斥為迷理人。	052	They accept the present existence but say past and future do not exist, or they accept only the present as still provisionally existent, or they deny all three periods of time as non-existent, all of these contradict the holy teachings and correct principles, and the wise should rebuke them as confused people.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b27_13']	諸有謗無實三世者，為無量種過失所塗，多設劬勞難令解脫。	諸有謗無實三世者，為無量種過失所塗，多設劬勞難令解脫。	052	Those who slander the true existence of the three periods of time are smeared with innumerable faults, and it is difficult for them to attain liberation even if they make great efforts.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631b29_2']	諸說三世實有論師，設有小違易令解脫，故有智者勿謗言無。	諸說三世實有論師，設有小違易令解脫，故有智者勿謗言無。	052	The proponents of the true existence of the three periods of time, even if there are minor disagreements, can easily attain liberation, therefore the wise should not slander them as non-existent.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c01_10']	然我且依尊者世友，約作用立三世有殊，隨己堪能排諸過難。	然我且依尊者世友，約作用立三世有殊，隨己堪能排諸過難。	052	However, I will now rely on Venerable Vasumitra, who distinguishes the three times based on function, and will use my own abilities to eliminate the various objections.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c01_19']	且彼經主作是難言：	且彼經主作是難言：	052	First, the author of the treatise raises this objection:
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c03_7']	若約作用立三世別，彼同分攝眼等諸根現在前時有何作用？	若約作用立三世別，彼同分攝眼等諸根現在前時有何作用？	052	If the distinction between the three times is established based on function, when the eyes and other faculties included in one's own continuity are present, what function do they have?
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c05_6']	若謂彼能取果與果，是則過去同類因等既能與果應有作用、有半作用，世相應雜。	若謂彼能取果與果，是則過去同類因等既能與果應有作用、有半作用，世相應雜。	052	If it is said that they can take effects and give effects, then past homogeneous causes and so forth, since they can give effects, should have function, and should have half a function, and the characteristics of the three times would be mixed up.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c06_14']	此難都由不了法性，諸法勢力總有二種，一名作用、二謂功能。	此難都由不了法性，諸法勢力總有二種，一名作用、二謂功能。	052	This objection is entirely due to not understanding the nature of dharmas. The power of dharmas is generally of two kinds: one is function, and the other is capability.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c08_2', 'ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c09_1']	引果功能名為作用，非唯作用總攝功能，亦有功能異於作用。🔽且闇中眼見色功能為闇所違，非違作用。	引果功能名為作用，非唯作用總攝功能，亦有功能異於作用。 且闇中眼見色功能為闇所違，非違作用。	052	The capability of producing effects is called function. Function does not only generally include capability, there is also capability that is different from function.🔽For example, the capability of the eyes in the dark to see forms is obstructed by the dark, but it does not obstruct function.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c09_19']	謂有闇障違見功能，故眼闇中不能見色。	謂有闇障違見功能，故眼闇中不能見色。	052	That is to say, the obstruction of the dark opposes the capability of seeing, therefore the eyes in the dark are unable to see forms.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c10_17']	引果作用非闇所違，故眼闇中亦能引果。	引果作用非闇所違，故眼闇中亦能引果。	052	The function of attracting results is not obstructed by darkness, therefore one can attract results even in the dark.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c11_16']	無現在位作用有闕，現在唯依作用立故。	無現在位作用有闕，現在唯依作用立故。	052	There is no deficiency in the function of the present state, because the present is established only on the basis of function.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c14_13']	諸作用滅不至無為，於餘性生能為因性，此非作用但是功能，唯現在時能引果故，無為不能引自果故，唯引自果名作用故。	諸作用滅不至無為，於餘性生能為因性，此非作用但是功能，唯現在時能引果故，無為不能引自果故，唯引自果名作用故。	052	The cessation of function does not reach the unconditioned, but in the arising of other natures it can be the cause. This is not function but rather capacity, because only the present time can attract results, and because the unconditioned cannot attract its own results, and because only the attraction of one's own results is called function.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c15_12']	由此經主所舉釋中，與果功能亦是作用。	由此經主所舉釋中，與果功能亦是作用。	052	For this reason, in the explanation given by the author of the treatise, the capacity to give results is also function.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c17_1']	良由未善對法所宗，以過去因雖能與果，無作用故世相無雜。	良由未善對法所宗，以過去因雖能與果，無作用故世相無雜。	052	This is because he has not yet understood the fundamental tenets of the Abhidharma, because although past causes can give results, they do not have function, and therefore the characteristics of time are not mixed up.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c18_17']	然彼經主於此義中，迷執情深復廣興難，謂廣論者不能善通，矯為我宗作理窮釋。	然彼經主於此義中，迷執情深復廣興難，謂廣論者不能善通，矯為我宗作理窮釋。	052	However, the author of the treatise, in this matter, is deeply confused and has many doubts. He says that the author of the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā cannot explain it well, and so he makes up a forced explanation for our school.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c19_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	052	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c20_0']	何礙用云何，　　無異世便壞，	何礙用云何，　　無異世便壞，	052	What obstructs function and how? If there were no difference in time, the world would be destroyed.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c21_13']	有誰未生滅，　　此法性甚深。	有誰未生滅，　　此法性甚深。	052	Who has not yet produced cessation? This dharma nature is very profound.

['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c23_18']	彼言若法自體恒有，應一切時能起作用，以何礙力令此法體所起作用時有時無？	彼言若法自體恒有，應一切時能起作用，以何礙力令此法體所起作用時有時無？	052	If the intrinsic nature of a dharma is always existent, it should be able to give rise to function at all times. What obstructing force would cause the function of this dharma to sometimes be present and sometimes absent?
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c25_7']	此難意言，諸法體相既恒無別，以何礙力非一切時唯一性類？	此難意言，諸法體相既恒無別，以何礙力非一切時唯一性類？	052	The meaning of this objection is: Since the characteristics of dharmas are always without distinction, what obstructing force would cause them not to be of a single nature at all times?
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c26_6']	此難非理，體相無別於性類一非證因故。	此難非理，體相無別於性類一非證因故。	052	This objection is unreasonable, because the absence of distinction in characteristics and nature is not a valid reason for the oneness of nature and class.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c27_5']	謂不可以體相無別，於性類一為能證因。	謂不可以體相無別，於性類一為能證因。	052	That is to say, one cannot use the absence of distinction in characteristics and nature as a valid reason for the oneness of nature and class.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0631c28_13']	現見世間體相無別，性類有別，如前已辯，謂地界等受等眼等。	現見世間體相無別，性類有別，如前已辯，謂地界等受等眼等。	052	It is currently seen in the world that there is distinction in nature and class even when there is no distinction in characteristics and nature, as has already been explained, namely the earth element, etc., feeling, etc., and the eye, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0632a02_2']	或難意言，我宗諸行眾緣和合本無而生，然彼眾緣種種差別，有時和合有不合時，法不恒生，可無過失。	或難意言，我宗諸行眾緣和合本無而生，然彼眾緣種種差別，有時和合有不合時，法不恒生，可無過失。	052	Or the meaning of the objection is: In our school, the various activities are originally non-existent when the various conditions come together, but those various conditions have various distinctions, sometimes coming together and sometimes not coming together. The dharma is not always produced, so there is no fault in saying this.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0632a03_20']	汝宗諸行及彼眾緣，於一切時許常有體，勿許諸法本無今有，應常現在，何能為礙？	汝宗諸行及彼眾緣，於一切時許常有體，勿許諸法本無今有，應常現在，何能為礙？	052	Your school asserts that all conditioned forces and their conditions always exist in substance at all times. Do not allow that dharmas that did not exist previously exist now. They should always be present. How can you obstruct them so that their activity is not eternal and they are not always present?
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0632a04_9']	此亦不然，前義成故。	此亦不然，前義成故。	052	This is also not so, because the former meaning is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0632a05_8']	謂且前說體相雖同，而性類殊，義已成立。	謂且前說體相雖同，而性類殊，義已成立。	052	That is, it is said that although substance and characteristics are the same, their natures are different, and the meaning is already established.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0632a07_5']	而言諸行自體眾緣，於一切時許常有體，何礙令彼作用非恒，非一切時常現在者。	而言諸行自體眾緣，於一切時許常有體，何礙令彼作用非恒，非一切時常現在者。	052	It is said that the substance of conditioned forces and their conditions always exist in substance at all times. What obstructs them so that their activity is not eternal? It is not that they are not always present.
['ZH_T29_1562_052:0632a09_3']	若解前義，此難應無，以體雖同而性類別，足能成立作用非恒，故彼不應作如是難。	若解前義，此難應無，以體雖同而性類別，足能成立作用非恒，故彼不應作如是難。	052	If you understand the former meaning, this objection should not exist, because although substance is the same, their natures are different, and this is sufficient to establish that activity is not eternal. Therefore, they should not make this kind of objection.
