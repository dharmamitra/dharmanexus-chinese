Outside of oneself, there is no other over there. Subsuming others as the same as oneself, one always practices to rescue and liberate.
['ZH_T38_1782_04a:1055a16_11']	他外無自此，他得樂時，如我得故。	他外無自此，他得樂時，如我得故。	04a	Outside of others, there is no self here. When others attain happiness, it is as if oneself attains it.
