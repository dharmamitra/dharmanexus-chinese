Therefore, among the praises of virtues above, none do not enter the stage of consecration, which is the stage of the ten grounds.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c01_4']	又云獲諸菩薩普見三昧者，明以其十地智眼普見眾生根欲差別故。	又云獲諸菩薩普見三昧者，明以其十地智眼普見眾生根欲差別故。	Moreover, it is said that they attained the bodhisattvas' universal vision samādhi, which illustrates that with the wisdom eye of the ten grounds, they universally see the differences in the faculties and desires of sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c03_8']	大悲安隱一切眾生者，以自十地道滿，不離方便三空七覺方便行華引接含識，是入普賢行故。	大悲安隱一切眾生者，以自十地道滿，不離方便三空七覺方便行華引接含識，是入普賢行故。	With great compassion, they bring peace and security to all sentient beings. With the perfection of their own ten grounds, they do not leave behind the practices of the three emptinesses and seven factors of enlightenment, using the flowers of skillful means to guide and transform sentient beings. This is entering the approach of Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c06_1']	於此品以三昧力三求推覓不見普賢者，明三昧雖有慈悲，是出世心多，以此不見十一地之位普賢入俗利生之門。	於此品以三昧力三求推覓不見普賢者，明三昧雖有慈悲，是出世心多，以此不見十一地之位普賢入俗利生之門。	In this chapter, using the power of samādhi to search in three ways but not seeing Samantabhadra illustrates that although samādhi has compassion, it is mostly a supramundane mind, and thus does not see the approach of Samantabhadra on the eleventh ground of entering the mundane to benefit beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c07_16']	三求推覓方見普賢者，明從十地昇進入普賢行果之位，成普賢寂用自在門故。	三求推覓方見普賢者，明從十地昇進入普賢行果之位，成普賢寂用自在門故。	The third, seeking and searching only then seeing Samantabhadra, clarifies ascending from the ten grounds into the position of Samantabhadra's practice and fruition, accomplishing the gate of Samantabhadra's tranquil and functioning self-mastery.

['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c14_11']	又明雖成八地已後乃至十地十一地及佛位，而常不壞七地以前三空七覺諸方便行故，是故列眾之內以菩薩名數表之，使易解故。	又明雖成八地已後乃至十地十一地及佛位，而常不壞七地以前三空七覺諸方便行故，是故列眾之內以菩薩名數表之，使易解故。	Moreover, it clarifies that although one accomplishes the grounds from the eighth ground onward up to the tenth ground, the eleventh ground, and the stage of buddhahood, one always does not destroy the various skillful means practices such as the three emptinesses and the seven factors of enlightenment prior to the seventh ground. Therefore, within the list of the assembly, it uses the number of bodhisattvas to represent it, making it easy to understand.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c15_17']	都舉十佛剎塵為數量者，明一一菩薩總具如是行遍周故。	都舉十佛剎塵為數量者，明一一菩薩總具如是行遍周故。	The total number of ten buddha-realms' dust motes is used to clarify that each and every bodhisattva is universally endowed with such practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c17_7']	是故《淨名經》云「雖成正覺轉於法輪，不捨菩薩之道，是菩薩行。	是故《淨名經》云「雖成正覺轉於法輪，不捨菩薩之道，是菩薩行。	Therefore, the Vimalakīrti Sūtra says, Although he has attained perfect enlightenment and turned the wheel of the Dharma, he does not abandon the bodhisattva path, which is the practice of the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c19_7']	」此〈十定〉列眾之位，總是已成十地出世智悲之眾，不捨七地已前諸助道門，以利眾生故。	」此〈十定〉列眾之位，總是已成十地出世智悲之眾，不捨七地已前諸助道門，以利眾生故。	The ranks of the assembly listed in these ten samādhis are all those who have already attained the wisdom and compassion of the ten grounds and transcend the world, but they do not abandon the various aids to the path before the seventh ground in order to benefit sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c20_18']	亦是一切菩薩從初發心不離此定體，信進修行至於果滿，不遷時故。	亦是一切菩薩從初發心不離此定體，信進修行至於果滿，不遷時故。	This is also the case for all bodhisattvas, who from their initial generation of the mind of enlightenment do not depart from the essence of this samādhi. They progress in faith and practice until they reach the fulfillment of the fruit, without any passage of time.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c23_16']	此品之初以敘如來初成正覺之意，明說此四十品經及出生滅度時日總不遷，始終一際故、法本如是故，非是如來神通使然。	此品之初以敘如來初成正覺之意，明說此四十品經及出生滅度時日總不遷，始終一際故、法本如是故，非是如來神通使然。	At the beginning of this chapter, it describes the Tathāgata's initial attainment of perfect enlightenment, clarifying that the teaching of this forty-fascicle sūtra and the time of his birth and parinirvāṇa are all without passage, with beginning and end as one, because the Dharma is originally thus, and it is not the case that the Tathāgata's spiritual powers make it so.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c24_18']	約智境實論，不隨妄情所說多劫，以智照之可見。	約智境實論，不隨妄情所說多劫，以智照之可見。	In terms of the realm of wisdom, if one truly discusses it, it is not subject to the many eons spoken of by deluded emotions. It can be seen through the illumination of wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0923c26_18']	所列前後五位之法及眾，各以隨位菩薩一時頓彰，明智法界無始末也，總以此十定為體。	所列前後五位之法及眾，各以隨位菩薩一時頓彰，明智法界無始末也，總以此十定為體。	The five stages of dharmas and assemblies listed before and after are each manifested by the bodhisattvas of the corresponding stage at one time, clarifying that the Dharma realm of wisdom has no beginning or end, and this is generally taken as the essence of the ten samādhis.

['ZH_T36_1739_029:0924a03_2']	以實而論，無有盡極，但以根本智為佛自果，餘差別智中一切法總是菩薩行故，故以十佛剎塵為數量。	以實而論，無有盡極，但以根本智為佛自果，餘差別智中一切法總是菩薩行故，故以十佛剎塵為數量。	In reality, there is no limit, but the fundamental wisdom is taken as the Buddha's own fruition, and all dharmas in the remaining discriminating wisdom are the practices of the bodhisattvas, so the dust motes in the ten buddha lands are taken as the quantity.

For this reason, the Tathāgata instructs one to think of Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0924a27_1']	經云「諸菩薩得如來力」者，即十力也。	經云「諸菩薩得如來力」者，即十力也。	The sūtra says, The bodhisattvas attain the power of the Tathāgata, which refers to the ten powers.

Using the wisdom of the ten grounds to perfect the discriminating wisdom of Samantabhadra, it reaches the chapter on manifestation, where it finally matches. As for what is symbolized in that chapter, it is as explained in that chapter itself.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0924b04_16']	如善財見彌勒菩薩，同一生之佛果，却令見文殊，憶念文殊便聞普賢名，及入無量三昧，自見其身入普賢身，是其樣式。	如善財見彌勒菩薩，同一生之佛果，却令見文殊，憶念文殊便聞普賢名，及入無量三昧，自見其身入普賢身，是其樣式。	It is like Sudhana seeing Maitreya Bodhisattva, the same fruition of Buddhahood in one life, but then being made to see Mañjuśrī. Remembering Mañjuśrī, he then hears the name Samantabhadra, and enters immeasurable samādhis. He sees his own body enter the body of Samantabhadra. This is the pattern.

The chapter on leaving the world is the practices of Samantabhadra after the fruition of Buddhahood.

['ZH_T36_1739_029:0924b12_13']	如十地佛果後普賢行及所有三昧，純是善入世間，無求出世佛果故。	如十地佛果後普賢行及所有三昧，純是善入世間，無求出世佛果故。	Like the Buddha-fruit after the ten grounds and the practices of Samantabhadra, and all the samadhis, they are purely entering the world, without seeking the Buddha-fruit of leaving the world.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0924b14_10']	以將兼修悲智出世佛果三昧，三求不見，純是大悲無有自利之行，即不相見故。	以將兼修悲智出世佛果三昧，三求不見，純是大悲無有自利之行，即不相見故。	Because they are about to cultivate the samadhis of compassion, wisdom, leaving the world, and the Buddha-fruit, the three searches do not see them, they are purely great compassion without the practice of benefiting oneself, so they do not see each other.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0924b16_1']	以十地佛果已前行普賢行，有自利利他之心，以求出世間解脫故。	以十地佛果已前行普賢行，有自利利他之心，以求出世間解脫故。	Because the practices of Samantabhadra before the Buddha-fruit of the ten grounds have the mind of benefiting oneself and others, seeking to leave the world and attain liberation.
['ZH_T36_1739_029:0924b17_6']	以十一地行普賢之行，不求自己解脫，純是利生之行故。	以十一地行普賢之行，不求自己解脫，純是利生之行故。	Because the practices of Samantabhadra in the eleventh ground do not seek one's own liberation, they are purely the practices of benefiting sentient beings.
