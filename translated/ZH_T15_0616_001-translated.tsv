Because one is free from desire, evil, and unwholesome states, and has a single-pointed concentration, one is able to experience bliss. The form realm's derivative form has the characteristic of light, and therefore the practitioner sees a wondrous light illuminating both inside and outside of the body.
['ZH_T15_0616_001:0288b23_11']	行者如是心意轉異，瞋處不瞋、喜處不喜，世間八法所不能動，信敬慚愧轉多增倍，於衣服飲食等心不貪著，但以諸善功德為貴、餘者為賤，於天五欲尚不繫心，何況世間不淨五欲？	行者如是心意轉異，瞋處不瞋、喜處不喜，世間八法所不能動，信敬慚愧轉多增倍，於衣服飲食等心不貪著，但以諸善功德為貴、餘者為賤，於天五欲尚不繫心，何況世間不淨五欲？	001	The practitioner's mind and thoughts become transformed in this way, not being angry where one should not be angry, and not being joyful where one should not be joyful. The eight worldly dharmas are unable to move him. Faith, respect, shame, and conscience increase twofold. He is not attached to clothing, food, and drink, but only values wholesome virtues and considers other things to be inferior. He does not even fixate his mind on the five desires of the heavens, let alone on the impure five desires of the world.

The desire realm body receiving bliss cannot be universally pervasive. The fires of desire and anger in the desire realm heat the body. Entering the pool of the first dhyāna, the supreme cool bliss removes all heat and distress, like entering a cool pool after extreme heat.

Although good thoughts and contemplations seem like good friends, they are also thieves, because they rob one's great benefits. Therefore, he should advance to seek the cessation of the two thoughts and contemplations. The disturbance of thoughts and contemplations is like the disturbance of various sounds to a tired and peaceful sleeper. Therefore, the practitioner, after extinguishing these thoughts and contemplations, seeks the second meditation. It is like wind and soil being able to muddy clear water so that one cannot see one's face in it. The five desires of the desire realm muddy the mind like soil muddying water, and thoughts and contemplations disturb the mind like wind moving water. Because thoughts and contemplations are extinguished, one internally attains purity, without thoughts and contemplations, and the joy and pleasure of concentration arise, entering the second meditation.

In the same way, the inner mind is pure, so it is called the noble silence.

The second dhyāna concentration has afflictions that cover the mind, namely love, pride, wrong views, doubt, and so forth, which destroy the concentrated mind. These are the thieves of the second dhyāna that block the door to the third dhyāna. Therefore, one should seek to eliminate these faults in order to attain the third dhyāna.

It is like a person who knows his wife is a rākṣasa, and is able to abandon her without regret or thought. Joy is a coarse and not wonderful delusion. In the third dhyāna, the body experiences bliss, and there is no worldly bliss that surpasses it. The sages pass through it, able to experience and abandon the bliss without joy.

If the mind becomes sunken, they should use the power of diligence and wisdom to uplift the mind. If it becomes greatly agitated, they should apply concentration.

Seeking the pleasure of the first meditation, because the disturbance of initial and sustained thought is abandoned, the great joy of the second meditation is abandoned because of agitation, and the third meditation knows that pleasure is impermanent and difficult to maintain, so it is abandoned. For this reason, one should abandon this pleasure and seek the land of peace and security in the fourth meditation.

If it were the suffering of the realm of desire, he should have said to first cut off suffering, sorrow, and joy, but he did not say so. For this reason, we know it is not the suffering of the realm of desire;

When the pleasure of the third dhyāna arises and abides, it is pleasant. When it ceases, it is suffering. For this reason, it is said to cease pleasure and cease suffering.

['ZH_T15_0616_001:0289c25_13']	若三禪中樂，生住時樂、滅時為苦，今說初禪二禪中喜，何獨不爾？	若三禪中樂，生住時樂、滅時為苦，今說初禪二禪中喜，何獨不爾？	001	If the pleasure of the third dhyāna is pleasant when arising and abiding, and suffering when ceasing, then why is it not the same for the joy of the first and second dhyānas as described here?

['ZH_T15_0616_001:0289c27_5']	佛經所說，離三禪時，斷樂斷苦無滅憂喜，初禪二禪不作是說。	佛經所說，離三禪時，斷樂斷苦無滅憂喜，初禪二禪不作是說。	001	In the Buddha's sūtras, it is said that when one is free from the third dhyāna, one ceases pleasure and suffering, and eliminates sorrow and joy. The first and second dhyānas do not say this.

The mind is attached to it. Because of attachment, impermanence gives rise to suffering. Because joy is coarse, it cannot pervade the body. Although there are losses, great sorrow does not arise. For this reason, the Buddha's sūtras do not speak of it.
['ZH_T15_0616_001:0290a03_13']	不苦不樂者，第四禪中雖有不苦不樂受，捨者捨三禪樂，行不苦不樂受不憶不悔。	不苦不樂者，第四禪中雖有不苦不樂受，捨者捨三禪樂，行不苦不樂受不憶不悔。	001	As for neither suffering nor pleasure, although there is neither-suffering-nor-pleasure feeling in the fourth dhyāna, one abandons the pleasure of the three dhyānas. One practices neither-suffering-nor-pleasure feeling, does not recollect, and does not regret.

It is like lighting a lamp in the wind on open ground. Although there is oil and a wick, because of the wind blowing, the light cannot illuminate;
['ZH_T15_0616_001:0290a08_15']	二禪中雖一識攝，以喜大發故定心散亂，是故不名念清淨；	二禪中雖一識攝，以喜大發故定心散亂，是故不名念清淨；	001	Although in the second meditation there is a single consciousness, because joy arises greatly, the concentrated mind is scattered and confused, and therefore it is not called pure mindfulness.

['ZH_T15_0616_001:0290a10_9']	四禪中都無此事故言念清淨。	四禪中都無此事故言念清淨。	001	In the fourth meditation, there is none of this, and therefore it is said to be pure mindfulness.

Here, because there is no inhalation and exhalation of breath, the mind is then easy to concentrate. Because it is easy to concentrate, mindfulness is pure.
['ZH_T15_0616_001:0290a16_5']	復次第四禪名為真禪，餘三禪者方便階梯，是第四禪譬如山頂，餘三禪定如上山道，是故第四禪，佛說為不動處，無有定所動處故，有名安隱調順之處，是第四禪相。	復次第四禪名為真禪，餘三禪者方便階梯，是第四禪譬如山頂，餘三禪定如上山道，是故第四禪，佛說為不動處，無有定所動處故，有名安隱調順之處，是第四禪相。	001	Furthermore, the fourth meditation is called true meditation, and the other three meditations are expedient steps. This fourth meditation is like the peak of a mountain, and the other three meditations are like the path up the mountain. Therefore, the Buddha said that the fourth meditation is an immovable place, because there is no place that is moved by concentration. It is called a place of peace and tranquility, which is the characteristic of the fourth meditation.
['ZH_T15_0616_001:0290a19_17']	譬如善御調馬隨意所至，行者得此第四禪，欲行四無量心隨意易得，欲修四念處修之則易，欲得四諦疾得不難，欲入四無色定易可得入，欲得六通求之亦易。	譬如善御調馬隨意所至，行者得此第四禪，欲行四無量心隨意易得，欲修四念處修之則易，欲得四諦疾得不難，欲入四無色定易可得入，欲得六通求之亦易。	001	It is like a skilled charioteer who can drive a horse wherever he wants to go. When a practitioner attains this fourth dhyāna, if he wants to practice the four immeasurables, it is easy to attain them as he wishes. If he wants to cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness, it is easy to cultivate them. If he wants to attain the four truths, it is not difficult to attain them quickly. If he wants to enter the four formless concentrations, it is easy to enter them. If he wants to attain the six supernormal powers, it is also easy to seek them.

['ZH_T15_0616_001:0292b12_12']	頂上、額上、眉間、鼻端、心處，如是等處住意在骨不令外念，外念諸緣攝之令還。	頂上、額上、眉間、鼻端、心處，如是等處住意在骨不令外念，外念諸緣攝之令還。	001	The top of the head, the forehead, between the eyebrows, the tip of the nose, and the heart. In these and other places, dwell the mind in the bones, not allowing external thoughts, and gather back the external conditions of thoughts.

If the mind is exhausted, abandon external thoughts and focus the mind on the object, like a monkey that is tethered to a post and runs around all day, but the chain always pulls it back.

The practitioner's contemplation of the mind is also like this. Gradually control the mind and make it dwell on the object. If the mind dwells for a long time, this is the method of dhyāna.

This is called the contemplation of purity. At this time, one immediately attains the mind in the form realm. This is called the initial practice of the method of dhyāna.

Due to the power of the light, one sees the appearance of the skeleton, similar to the arising and ceasing of various mental factors associated with the mind, like water flowing in a beryl tube. At this time, the mind and breath attain bliss, incomparable to the bliss of a lustful person.
