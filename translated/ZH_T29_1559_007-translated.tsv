They warmed ghee and oil, and the juice of smooth śamali, and used it to smear their hands. Their hands held a small sharp blade, and inside the womb, like a cesspool, in the most intense stench, darkness, and impure vessel, the abode of countless thousands of worms, with filthy juice constantly flowing, always needing to be counteracted, with impurities, blood, dirt, grease, and mucus, wet, rotten, and smelly, stained by smoothness, contemptible and hard to see, with a thin skin that was pierced and leaking, covering the top, created by past karma, with a large wound hole in the body, the hand inserted inside, cutting and pulling it out piece by piece.

['ZH_T29_1559_007:0205a09_2']	由此道理，生以惑業為因，惑業以生為因，生復以惑業為因，如是應知生死輪無初。	由此道理，生以惑業為因，惑業以生為因，生復以惑業為因，如是應知生死輪無初。	By this principle, birth has afflictions and karma as its cause, afflictions and karma have birth as their cause, and birth again has afflictions and karma as its cause. In this way, one should understand that the wheel of birth and death has no beginning.
['ZH_T29_1559_007:0205a09_6', 'ZH_T29_1559_007:0205a10_1']	何以故？🔽若分別執有初，此初應成無因。	何以故？ 若分別執有初，此初應成無因。	Why is this?🔽If one discriminates and grasps that there is a beginning, this beginning would be established as having no cause.

It is the same with fire and so forth as causes for cooking and so forth. Therefore there is no arising without a cause.
['ZH_T29_1559_007:0205a14_4']	說常住為因，於前已破，是故生死必定無初。	說常住為因，於前已破，是故生死必定無初。	As for the assertion of a permanent cause, that has already been refuted above. Therefore birth and death definitely have no beginning.
