The Dharma body has no form and also no arising or ceasing. Sentient beings have the capacity for arising and ceasing, which moves the Dharma body. By the power of the Tathāgata's vows, he responds by being the same as arising and ceasing. The view of arising and ceasing comes from sentient beings themselves.

Relying on the four siddhāntas to treat the illnesses of sentient beings is like well treating various illnesses.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134b18_19']	《無量義》云「醫王大醫王」，以大醫故稱為良醫。	《無量義》云「醫王大醫王」，以大醫故稱為良醫。	09b	The Infinite Meaning Sutra says king of physicians, great king of physicians, because of being a great physician it is called a good doctor.

['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134b22_16']	一、就一切眾生，皆有三種性德，佛性即是佛子，故云「其中眾生悉是吾子」，此文云「多諸子息」也。	一、就一切眾生，皆有三種性德，佛性即是佛子，故云「其中眾生悉是吾子」，此文云「多諸子息」也。	09b	First, all sentient beings possess three kinds of inherent virtues, and buddha-nature is precisely the Buddha's son. Therefore, it is said that all sentient beings are my children. This text says many sons and daughters.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134b25_8']	約十心數法即有百子，心王為正因佛性，慧是了因性，餘九相扶起屬緣因性，一數起時九數扶助，如是成百也。	約十心數法即有百子，心王為正因佛性，慧是了因性，餘九相扶起屬緣因性，一數起時九數扶助，如是成百也。	09b	In terms of the ten mental activities, there are then a hundred sons. The mind-king is the inherent buddha-nature of the direct cause, wisdom is the inherent buddha-nature of the understanding cause, and the remaining nine mutually support each other and belong to the inherent buddha-nature of the conditional cause. When a single mental activity arises, the other nine activities assist it. In this way, it becomes a hundred.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134b27_12']	性德佛子非善非惡而通善惡，故此十數及與心王為通心數，是以性德三因，悉屬正因佛子。	性德佛子非善非惡而通善惡，故此十數及與心王為通心數，是以性德三因，悉屬正因佛子。	09b	The inherent virtuous buddha-son is neither good nor evil but pervades good and evil. Therefore, these ten mental activities and the mind-king are the universal mental activities. Thus, the three inherent causes all belong to the buddha-son of the direct cause.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134b29_11']	二者就昔結緣為佛子，如十六王子覆講《法華》，時聞法者亦生微解，即成了因性；	二者就昔結緣為佛子，如十六王子覆講《法華》，時聞法者亦生微解，即成了因性；	09b	Second, those who formed the karmic affinity in the past and became the Buddha's disciples, like the sixteen princes who expounded the Lotus Sutra in the past, those who heard the Dharma then also gave rise to subtle understanding, which became the nature of accomplished causes;
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c01_3']	昔微能修行，為緣因性；	昔微能修行，為緣因性；	09b	In the past, they were able to cultivate the practice, which became the nature of conditional causes;

These three causes all belong to conditional causes, which assist in giving rise to the understanding of the one true reality today. Therefore, those who formed the karmic affinity in the past are called the Buddha's disciples who are conditional causes, which are the thirty children in the burning house.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c04_18']	此約十信，一信起時即具餘九，還有百信，故得結緣為佛子也。	此約十信，一信起時即具餘九，還有百信，故得結緣為佛子也。	09b	This is based on the ten stages of faith. When one faith arises, it is already endowed with the other nine, and there are also one hundred faiths. Therefore, they are able to form the karmic affinity and become the Buddha's disciples.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c07_17']	三者了因之子，即是今日聞《法華經》，安住實智中，我定當作佛，決了聲聞法，是諸經之王，從佛口生、得佛法分，故名真子。	三者了因之子，即是今日聞《法華經》，安住實智中，我定當作佛，決了聲聞法，是諸經之王，從佛口生、得佛法分，故名真子。	09b	Third, the children of the discerning cause are those who hear the Lotus Sutra today, abide in true wisdom, determine to become Buddhas, understand the Dharma of the śrāvakas, which is the king of all sūtras, are born from the Buddha's mouth, and receive their share of the Buddha's Dharma. Therefore, they are called true children.

['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c18_7']	一、諸子於後飲毒，譬上機應相關，見諸眾生德薄垢重，眾生於佛滅後，樂著三界邪師之法，故云「飲他毒藥」，即是「遊行詣他國」，輪轉諸趣墮在三界，故云「宛轉于地」。	一、諸子於後飲毒，譬上機應相關，見諸眾生德薄垢重，眾生於佛滅後，樂著三界邪師之法，故云「飲他毒藥」，即是「遊行詣他國」，輪轉諸趣墮在三界，故云「宛轉于地」。	09b	First, the children drinking poison is a metaphor for the connection between the Buddha's response and the capacities of sentient beings. Seeing that sentient beings have shallow virtues and heavy defilements, after the Buddha's nirvāṇa, they delight in and cling to the teachings of non-Buddhist masters in the three realms, thus it says drinking other's poisonous medicine, which is the same as wandering and going to other countries. Transmigrating through the various destinies and falling into the three realms, it says rolling on the ground.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c19_14']	「是時其父還來歸家」下，譬上我少出家得三菩提第二非生現生也。	「是時其父還來歸家」下，譬上我少出家得三菩提第二非生現生也。	09b	At that time, the father returned home below is a metaphor for the Buddha's second non-birth appearing as birth, which is mentioned above in the line I left home at a young age and attained supreme perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c22_15']	上有二，形聲及利益不虛，今言諸子飲毒去譬上形益，信受邪師之法名為「飲毒」，「失心」是無大小機感生，不失心是有大小機感生。	上有二，形聲及利益不虛，今言諸子飲毒去譬上形益，信受邪師之法名為「飲毒」，「失心」是無大小機感生，不失心是有大小機感生。	09b	There are two parts above: the non-emptiness of form, sound, and benefits. Now, the metaphor of the children drinking poison is a metaphor for the above form and benefits. Clinging to and accepting the teachings of non-Buddhist masters is called drinking poison. Losing one's mind means lacking the capacities for the Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna to give rise to the Buddha's appearance in the world. Not losing one's mind means having the capacities for the Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna to give rise to the Buddha's appearance in the world.

['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c27_1']	不失心者，雖著五欲而不失三乘善根，為是人故非生現生，善強惡輕見佛即能修道斷結，如子見父求藥病愈；	不失心者，雖著五欲而不失三乘善根，為是人故非生現生，善強惡輕見佛即能修道斷結，如子見父求藥病愈；	09b	Those who do not lose their minds, although attached to the five desires, do not lose the wholesome roots of the Three Vehicles. For their sake, the Buddha appears in the world even though he is not born. Those with strong wholesome [roots] and light evil [karma] see the Buddha and are immediately able to cultivate the path and sever their bonds, like a child seeing his father and seeking medicine to cure his illness.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0134c29_2']	善輕惡重得見佛，亦求護而不修道，如子見父求救不肯服藥，父為此子唱言應死。	善輕惡重得見佛，亦求護而不修道，如子見父求救不肯服藥，父為此子唱言應死。	09b	Those with light wholesome [roots] and heavy evil [karma] also see the Buddha and seek protection, but do not cultivate the path, like a child seeing his father and seeking rescue, but unwilling to take medicine. The father declares that he should die for this child.
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0135a02_4']	「遙見」者，明佛出世時眾生亦見色身，而為見、思障隔五分，不得親奉法身，故云「遙」也。	「遙見」者，明佛出世時眾生亦見色身，而為見、思障隔五分，不得親奉法身，故云「遙」也。	09b	Seeing from afar clarifies that when the Buddha appears in the world, sentient beings also see his physical body, but are obstructed by the five parts of views and thoughts, and are unable to personally receive the Dharma body, so it is said from afar.

['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0135a04_7']	「父見子等苦」下，譬上聲益，又二：	「父見子等苦」下，譬上聲益，又二：	09b	The father sees the suffering of his children below illustrates the benefit of sound mentioned above, and has two parts:
['ZH_T34_1718_09b:0135a05_1']	初譬佛受請轉二諦法輪也。	初譬佛受請轉二諦法輪也。	09b	First, it illustrates the Buddha accepting the request and turning the Dharma wheel of the two truths.
