The śrāvaka teachings only eliminate the afflictive hindrances, while the bodhisattva teachings eliminate both the afflictive hindrances and the cognitive hindrances.

For those capable of receiving the great path, the Buddha Vehicle is taught, which is called the Great Vehicle. For those incapable of receiving it, the Small Vehicle is taught.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0382c29_2']	」又云「是波若中廣說三乘之教」，又云「二乘智斷是菩薩無生法忍」，又云「欲住須陀洹者亦不應離是忍」，故知波若是三乘通教。	」又云「是波若中廣說三乘之教」，又云「二乘智斷是菩薩無生法忍」，又云「欲住須陀洹者亦不應離是忍」，故知波若是三乘通教。	003	It also says, In this prajñā-pāramitā, the teachings of the three vehicles are extensively explained, and it also says, The wisdom and severance of the two vehicles are the non-arising of dharmas forbearance of the bodhisattva, and it also says, Those who wish to abide in the stream-enterer stage should also not be apart from this forbearance. Therefore, we know that prajñā-pāramitā is the common teaching of the three vehicles.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0383a02_13']	今欲為彌勒等廣說菩薩行，故說《波若》。	今欲為彌勒等廣說菩薩行，故說《波若》。	003	Now, wishing to extensively expound the practices of the bodhisattvas for Maitreya and the others, it therefore expounds the prajñā-pāramitā.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0383a03_21']	不言今欲通說三乘人行故說《波若》，即知《波若》非三乘通教。	不言今欲通說三乘人行故說《波若》，即知《波若》非三乘通教。	003	It does not say that now, wishing to commonly expound the practices of the people of the three vehicles, it therefore expounds the prajñā-pāramitā. Therefore, we know that the prajñā-pāramitā is not the common teaching of the three vehicles.

Because of contemplating with lower wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of the śrāvakas, up to because of contemplating with higher wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of all buddhas.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0383a17_9']	又云《波若》出生三乘，故是三乘通教者，《大經》云「即是聲聞藏出生諸聲聞，即是因緣藏出生緣覺。	又云《波若》出生三乘，故是三乘通教者，《大經》云「即是聲聞藏出生諸聲聞，即是因緣藏出生緣覺。	003	Moreover, it is said that prajna gives birth to the three vehicles, so it is the common teaching of the three vehicles. The Mahaparinirvana Sutra says: It is the sravaka canon that gives birth to all sravakas, it is the canon of dependent origination that gives birth to pratyekabuddhas.

Since the Prajñāpāramitā clarifies these two, then the Lotus Sūtra's clarification of becoming a buddha is the same as the Prajñāpāramitā. The Prajñāpāramitā and the Lotus Sūtra are not different, but the disclosure of the provisional side is different from the Prajñāpāramitā.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387b10_20']	《波若》因果大宗若斯。	《波若》因果大宗若斯。	003	The great purport of the causes and effects of the Prajnaparamita Sutra is like this.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387b13_3']	《法華》因果者，此經正開權顯實，故辨因明果，可謂融會今昔、結束始終，總序釋迦一化之大意也。	《法華》因果者，此經正開權顯實，故辨因明果，可謂融會今昔、結束始終，總序釋迦一化之大意也。	003	As for the causes and effects of the Lotus Sutra, this sutra directly opens the provisional and reveals the real, therefore distinguishing the causes and clarifying the fruits, which can be said to be harmonizing the past and present, and concluding the beginning and end, comprehensively outlining the great purport of Shakyamuni's teachings.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387b17_1']	一期出世教門雖多，不出權實二智、真應兩身，初則開權顯實，明三乘為方便、一乘為真實，故破昔三因三果，明今日一因一果，以因無別感唯有一因，果無異酬唯有一果。	一期出世教門雖多，不出權實二智、真應兩身，初則開權顯實，明三乘為方便、一乘為真實，故破昔三因三果，明今日一因一果，以因無別感唯有一因，果無異酬唯有一果。	003	Although the teachings of appearing in the world for one period are numerous, they do not go beyond the two kinds of wisdom of provisional and real, and the two kinds of bodies of true and response. First, it opens the provisional and reveals the real, clarifying that the three vehicles are expedient and the one vehicle is real. Therefore, it breaks the three causes and three fruits of the past and clarifies the one cause and one fruit of today. The cause is without distinction and only has one cause, and the fruit is without difference and only has one fruit.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387b18_18']	時眾雖知唯有一因無有異因、唯有一果無有異果，未知一果為同昔果、為異昔果？	時眾雖知唯有一因無有異因、唯有一果無有異果，未知一果為同昔果、為異昔果？	003	At that time, although the assembly knew there was only one cause and no other cause, and there was only one fruit and no other fruit, they still did not know whether the one fruit was the same as the fruits of the past or different from the fruits of the past.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387b20_3']	是故次辨開近顯遠，近謂如來應迹，遠即常住法身。	是故次辨開近顯遠，近謂如來應迹，遠即常住法身。	003	Therefore, next, it distinguishes the revealed from the concealed, with the concealed referring to the Tathāgata's response-body, and the revealed referring to the eternally abiding Dharma-body.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387b22_10']	但昔方便說近以覆遠，今開近顯遠，近遠既彰則本迹義顯，本迹義顯故成一果義，果義既成一因始立。	但昔方便說近以覆遠，今開近顯遠，近遠既彰則本迹義顯，本迹義顯故成一果義，果義既成一因始立。	003	But in the past, the Buddha used skillful means to speak of the concealed in order to conceal the revealed. Now, he reveals the concealed and manifests the revealed. Since the concealed and revealed are both made clear, the meaning of the original and traces is manifested. Since the meaning of the original and traces is manifested, the meaning of the one fruit is established. Since the meaning of the fruit is already established, the one cause is then set up.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387b28_6']	餘失心子不肯服藥，保執昔無常教，是以如來唱滅，因此廣破無常病逗以常藥，正以佛性為因、涅槃為果。	餘失心子不肯服藥，保執昔無常教，是以如來唱滅，因此廣破無常病逗以常藥，正以佛性為因、涅槃為果。	003	The other deluded sons were unwilling to take the medicine, clinging to the past teaching of impermanence. Therefore, the Tathāgata proclaimed extinction, and on this basis extensively refuted the illness of impermanence and applied the medicine of permanence. Precisely using buddha-nature as the cause and nirvāṇa as the fruit.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387c04_7']	如來之身所以常者，良由本有佛性，見佛性故所以為常，故〈純陀品〉云「未見佛性名為無常，見佛性故常恒無變。	如來之身所以常者，良由本有佛性，見佛性故所以為常，故〈純陀品〉云「未見佛性名為無常，見佛性故常恒無變。	003	The reason the Tathāgata's body is permanent is precisely because it originally has buddha-nature. Because one sees buddha-nature, it is therefore permanent. Therefore, the chapter on Cunda says: Not seeing buddha-nature is called impermanence. Because one sees buddha-nature, it is eternally unchanging.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387c06_16']	」故佛性之因、涅槃之果更無有異，隱名佛性、顯名涅槃，亦隱名如來藏、顯則成法身，又隱則為因、顯則為果。	」故佛性之因、涅槃之果更無有異，隱名佛性、顯名涅槃，亦隱名如來藏、顯則成法身，又隱則為因、顯則為果。	003	Therefore, the cause of buddha-nature and the fruition of nirvāṇa are no different. When hidden, it is called buddha-nature; when revealed, it is called nirvāṇa. It is also hidden as the tathāgatagarbha and revealed as the Dharma body. Moreover, when hidden it is the cause, and when revealed it is the fruition.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387c08_4']	然佛性未曾隱顯，約眾生不了故名為隱，若得了悟自為顯也。	然佛性未曾隱顯，約眾生不了故名為隱，若得了悟自為顯也。	003	However, buddha-nature has never been hidden or revealed. It is called hidden because sentient beings do not understand it. If they gain enlightenment, it is revealed by themselves.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387c11_13']	今三寶一體，所以常住。	今三寶一體，所以常住。	003	Now, the Three Jewels have one body, therefore they abide permanently.
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387c12_17']	故〈長壽品〉末云「如汝父母各各異故」，知是故無常；	故〈長壽品〉末云「如汝父母各各異故」，知是故無常；	003	Therefore, at the end of the chapter on long life, it says, Because your parents are each different, you should know that this is impermanent;
['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387c13_9']	以三寶不異，所以常住也。	以三寶不異，所以常住也。	003	Because the Three Jewels are not different, therefore they abide permanently.

Since the meaning of fruition is established, the meaning of cause is then revealed, and therefore it is also a further explanation and establishment of cause and effect.

['ZH_T34_1720_003:0387c18_1']	《大經》云「諸優婆塞常樂觀察諸對治門，謂常無常乃至我無我。	《大經》云「諸優婆塞常樂觀察諸對治門，謂常無常乃至我無我。	003	The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, The upāsakas always delight in contemplating the various gates for countering [mistaken views], namely permanence and impermanence, up to self and non-self.

Within it, all the teachings of the one vehicle that have not yet been understood are all harmonized and integrated. Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra is also called the Sutra that Opens the Secret Treasury.

Because bodhisattvas practice this cause, they directly progress to the fruit of buddhahood, and it is therefore called the fundamental Dharma wheel.

Therefore, they temporarily stop the great transformation and give various mixed teachings, either starting with the small and ending with the great, or starting with impermanence and ending with permanence.
