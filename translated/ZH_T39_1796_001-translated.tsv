['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a08_16']	「大毘盧遮那成佛神變加持」者，梵音毘盧遮那者是日之別名，即除暗遍明之義也。	「大毘盧遮那成佛神變加持」者，梵音毘盧遮那者是日之別名，即除暗遍明之義也。	The Mahāvairocana Buddha's Spiritual Powers and Transformations - the Sanskrit word Vairocana is a different name for the sun, which means removing darkness and illuminating everywhere.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a10_14']	然世間日則有方分，若照其外不能及內，明在一邊不至一邊，又唯在晝光不燭夜；	然世間日則有方分，若照其外不能及內，明在一邊不至一邊，又唯在晝光不燭夜；	However, the sun in the world has boundaries. If it shines outside, it cannot reach the inside. The light is on one side and does not reach the other side. Moreover, it only shines during the day and does not illuminate the night;
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a12_8']	如來智慧日光則不如是，遍一切處作大照明矣，無有內外方所晝夜之別。	如來智慧日光則不如是，遍一切處作大照明矣，無有內外方所晝夜之別。	The sun-like wisdom light of the Tathāgata is not like this. It universally illuminates everywhere, without any distinction of inside and outside, day and night.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a14_3']	復次日行閻浮提，一切卉木叢林隨其性分各得增長，世間眾務因之得成；	復次日行閻浮提，一切卉木叢林隨其性分各得增長，世間眾務因之得成；	Furthermore, as the sun travels through Jambudvīpa, all plants, trees, and forests grow according to their nature. Worldly affairs are accomplished through it;
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a16_10']	如來日光遍照法界，亦能平等開發無量眾生種種善根，乃至世間、出世間殊勝事業莫不由之而得成辦。	如來日光遍照法界，亦能平等開發無量眾生種種善根，乃至世間、出世間殊勝事業莫不由之而得成辦。	The sunlight of the Tathāgata universally illuminates the Dharma realm, and is also able to equally develop the various wholesome roots of innumerable sentient beings, up to the most excellent worldly and supramundane activities, which are all accomplished by it.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a20_10']	又如重陰昏蔽日輪隱沒亦非壞滅、猛風吹雲日光顯照亦非始生，佛心之日亦復如是，雖為無明煩惱戲論重雲之所覆障而無所減、究竟諸法實相三昧圓明無際而無所增。	又如重陰昏蔽日輪隱沒亦非壞滅、猛風吹雲日光顯照亦非始生，佛心之日亦復如是，雖為無明煩惱戲論重雲之所覆障而無所減、究竟諸法實相三昧圓明無際而無所增。	Moreover, it is like when heavy clouds obscure the sun's disk, it is not destroyed, and when a fierce wind blows away the clouds and the sunlight shines brightly, it is not newly arisen. The sun of the Buddha's mind is also like this. Although it is covered by the heavy clouds of ignorance, afflictions, and conceptual proliferation, it does not diminish; and in the ultimate samādhi of the true characteristics of dharmas, it is perfectly clear and boundless, without increase.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a22_13']	以如是等種種因緣，世間之日不可為喻，但取其少分相似，故加以大名，曰摩訶毘盧遮那也。	以如是等種種因緣，世間之日不可為喻，但取其少分相似，故加以大名，曰摩訶毘盧遮那也。	For these and other various reasons, the sun in the world cannot be used as a metaphor, but because it has a little similarity, it is given the great name, called Mahāvairocana.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a23_15']	「成佛」者，具足梵音應云成三菩提，是正覺正知義。	「成佛」者，具足梵音應云成三菩提，是正覺正知義。	To become a Buddha means to fully attain samyak-saṃbodhi, which is the meaning of right enlightenment and right knowledge.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a25_18']	謂以如實智，知過去未來現在、眾生數非眾生數、有常無常等一切諸法皆了了覺知，故名為覺。	謂以如實智，知過去未來現在、眾生數非眾生數、有常無常等一切諸法皆了了覺知，故名為覺。	That is to say, using the wisdom of suchness, one knows that all dharmas of the past, future, and present, whether sentient or non-sentient, permanent or impermanent, are all clearly and fully understood, and therefore it is called enlightenment.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a26_16']	而佛即是覺者，故就省文但云成佛也。	而佛即是覺者，故就省文但云成佛也。	And since the Buddha is precisely the enlightened one, in order to save on words it is simply said that he attained Buddhahood.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579a27_20']	「神變加持」者，舊譯或云神力所持、或云佛所護念。	「神變加持」者，舊譯或云神力所持、或云佛所護念。	Divine transformation and empowerment is translated in the old texts as either empowered by spiritual power or protected and remembered by the Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b02_5']	然此自證三菩提出過一切心地，現覺諸法本初不生，是處言語盡竟心行亦寂，若離如來威神之力，則雖十地菩薩尚非其境界，況餘生死中人。	然此自證三菩提出過一切心地，現覺諸法本初不生，是處言語盡竟心行亦寂，若離如來威神之力，則雖十地菩薩尚非其境界，況餘生死中人。	However, this self-realized enlightenment transcends all mind-grounds, and presently awakens to the original non-arising of all dharmas. In this place, language is completely exhausted and even mental activity is still. If one were to depart from the power of the Tathāgata's majestic spiritual power, then even the bodhisattvas of the tenth ground would not be its realm, let alone other people in the realm of birth and death.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b03_2']	爾時世尊往昔大悲願故，而作是念：	爾時世尊往昔大悲願故，而作是念：	At that time, due to the Tathāgata's great compassionate vows from the past, he had this thought:
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b04_3']	「若我但住如是境界，則諸有情不能以是蒙益。	「若我但住如是境界，則諸有情不能以是蒙益。	If I were to only abide in such a realm, then sentient beings would not be able to benefit from it.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b06_15']	」是故住於自在神力加持三昧，普為一切眾生示種種諸趣所憙見身、說種種性欲所宜聞法、隨種種心行開觀照門。	」是故住於自在神力加持三昧，普為一切眾生示種種諸趣所憙見身、說種種性欲所宜聞法、隨種種心行開觀照門。	Therefore, abiding in the samādhi of empowered spiritual powers, he universally manifests for all sentient beings various bodies that are pleasing to see in the various destinies, expounds various teachings that are suitable to hear according to their dispositions and desires, and opens the door of insight in accordance with their various mental activities.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b08_9']	然此應化非從毘盧遮那身或語或意生，於一切時處起滅邊際俱不可得。	然此應化非從毘盧遮那身或語或意生，於一切時處起滅邊際俱不可得。	However, these transformations do not arise from the body, speech, or mind of Vairocana. The limits of arising and ceasing in all times and places are both unobtainable.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b10_12']	譬如幻師以呪術力加持藥草，能現種種未曾有事，五情所對悅可眾心，若捨加持然後隱沒。	譬如幻師以呪術力加持藥草，能現種種未曾有事，五情所對悅可眾心，若捨加持然後隱沒。	It is like a magician who, by the power of spells and herbs, is able to manifest various unprecedented events that delight the minds of the five senses. If he abandons the empowerment, they will then disappear.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b12_11']	如來金剛之幻亦復如是，緣謝則滅、機興則生，即事而真無有終盡，故曰神力加持經。	如來金剛之幻亦復如是，緣謝則滅、機興則生，即事而真無有終盡，故曰神力加持經。	The vajra-like illusions of the Tathāgata are also like this. When conditions cease, they disappear; when conditions arise, they appear. They are real in the midst of events and have no end. Therefore, it is called the Sutra of Empowered Spiritual Powers.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b13_9']	若據梵本，應具題云大廣博經因陀羅王。	若據梵本，應具題云大廣博經因陀羅王。	If based on the Sanskrit text, it should be fully titled as the Sutra of Great Vastness, the King of Indra.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b13_19']	因陀羅王者，帝釋也。	因陀羅王者，帝釋也。	The King of Indra is Śakra.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b15_14']	言此經是一切如來祕要之藏，於大乘眾教威德特尊，猶如千目為釋天之主。	言此經是一切如來祕要之藏，於大乘眾教威德特尊，猶如千目為釋天之主。	It is said that this sutra is the secret treasury of all Tathagatas, and its majestic virtue is especially revered among the teachings of the Mahayana, just as Indra, with a thousand eyes, is the lord of the gods.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b16_7']	今恐經題大廣，故不具存。	今恐經題大廣，故不具存。	Now, fearing that the title of the sutra is too long, it is not fully preserved.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b17_3']	入真言門住心品者，梵本具有二題：	入真言門住心品者，梵本具有二題：	The chapter on entering the mantra gate and abiding in the mind has two titles in the Sanskrit version:
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b18_3']	初云〈脩真言行品〉、次云〈入真言門住心品〉。	初云〈脩真言行品〉、次云〈入真言門住心品〉。	The first is Chapter on Cultivating Mantra Practices, and the second is Chapter on Entering the Mantra Gate and Abiding in the Mind.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b19_4']	竊謂入住之義以兼修行語，故離煩文但著其一。	竊謂入住之義以兼修行語，故離煩文但著其一。	I suspect that the meaning of entering and abiding also includes the words cultivation and practice, so the troublesome text is removed and only one is kept.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b20_6']	真言，梵曰漫怛攞，即是真語如語、不忘不異之音。	真言，梵曰漫怛攞，即是真語如語、不忘不異之音。	Mantra, in Sanskrit mantra, is the sound of true speech, such as speech, not forgotten and not different.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b21_8']	龍樹釋論謂之祕密號，舊譯云呪，非正翻也。	龍樹釋論謂之祕密號，舊譯云呪，非正翻也。	Nagarjuna's commentary on the treatise calls it a secret name, and the old translation calls it a spell, which is not the correct translation.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b22_10']	此品統論經之大意，所謂眾生自心即是一切智智。	此品統論經之大意，所謂眾生自心即是一切智智。	This chapter generally discusses the main idea of the sutra, namely, the mind of sentient beings is the wisdom of all buddhas.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b23_4']	如實了知名為一切智者。	如實了知名為一切智者。	One who truly understands this is called the one with omniscience.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b25_12']	是故此教諸菩薩真語為門，自心發菩提即心具萬行，見心正等覺、證心大涅槃，發起心方便嚴淨心佛國。	是故此教諸菩薩真語為門，自心發菩提即心具萬行，見心正等覺、證心大涅槃，發起心方便嚴淨心佛國。	Therefore, in this teaching, the true words of the bodhisattvas are the gateway. Generating bodhicitta is the mind itself, which is replete with myriad practices. Seeing the mind is perfect enlightenment, realizing the mind is great nirvāṇa. Generating the mind's skillful means purifies the mind's buddha land.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b26_20']	從因至果皆以無所住而住其心，故曰〈入真言門住心品〉也。	從因至果皆以無所住而住其心，故曰〈入真言門住心品〉也。	From cause to fruition, all abide in the mind without abiding. Therefore, it is called the chapter on entering the mantra gateway and abiding in the mind.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b27_9']	入真言門，略有三事：	入真言門，略有三事：	Entering the mantra gateway is briefly threefold:
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579b28_14']	一者身密門、二者語密門、三者心密門，是事下當廣說。	一者身密門、二者語密門、三者心密門，是事下當廣說。	First, the door of the body's secrets; second, the door of the speech's secrets; third, the door of the mind's secrets. These will be explained in detail below.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c02_7']	行者以此三方便自淨三業，即為如來三密之所加持，乃至能於此生滿足地波羅密，不復經歷劫數備修諸對治行。	行者以此三方便自淨三業，即為如來三密之所加持，乃至能於此生滿足地波羅密，不復經歷劫數備修諸對治行。	The practitioner, with these three skillful means, purifies the three karmas, and is then empowered by the Tathāgata's three secrets. Even in this lifetime, they can perfect the pāramitās and will not have to undergo numerous eons cultivating various counteractive practices.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c03_12']	故《大品》云「或有菩薩初發心時，即上菩薩位得不退轉。	故《大品》云「或有菩薩初發心時，即上菩薩位得不退轉。	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says: There are bodhisattvas who, upon first generating the mind of enlightenment, immediately ascend to the bodhisattva stages and attain irreversibility.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c04_10']	或有初發心時，即得無上菩提便轉法輪。	或有初發心時，即得無上菩提便轉法輪。	Some, when first generating the mind, immediately attain unsurpassed enlightenment and immediately turn the Dharma wheel.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c05_15']	」龍樹以為如遠行，乘羊去者久久乃到，馬則差速。	」龍樹以為如遠行，乘羊去者久久乃到，馬則差速。	Nāgârjuna considered it to be like traveling a long distance, going by sheep is very slow, but by horse it is much faster.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c06_11']	若乘神通人，於發意頃便至所詣。	若乘神通人，於發意頃便至所詣。	If one rides a person with spiritual powers, in the time it takes to raise one's thoughts one arrives at one's destination.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c07_3']	不得云發意間云何得到？	不得云發意間云何得到？	One cannot say that in the time it takes to raise one's thoughts how can one arrive?
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c07_13']	神通相爾，不應生疑。	神通相爾，不應生疑。	The characteristics of spiritual powers are like this, one should not give rise to doubt.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c07_20']	則此經深旨也。	則此經深旨也。	This is the profound purport of this sūtra.

The five meanings at the beginning of the sūtra are extensively explained in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c10_6']	然此經梵本闕無通序。	然此經梵本闕無通序。	However, the Sanskrit text of this sūtra lacks a general introduction.

['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c12_5']	「毘盧遮那大本有十萬偈，以浩廣難持故，傳法聖者採其宗要凡三千餘頌。	「毘盧遮那大本有十萬偈，以浩廣難持故，傳法聖者採其宗要凡三千餘頌。	The great text of Mahāvairocana has one hundred thousand gāthās. Because it is vast and difficult to uphold, the holy ones who transmit the Dharma have selected its essential points, a total of over three thousand gāthās.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c13_9']	雖真言行法文義略周，以非大經正本故，不題通序。	雖真言行法文義略周，以非大經正本故，不題通序。	Although the text and meaning of the mantra practice method are briefly complete, because it is not the main text of the great sūtra, it does not have a general preface.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c14_1']	」今以例加之，於義無傷也。	」今以例加之，於義無傷也。	Now, by adding it as an example, there is no harm to the meaning.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c14_15']	薄伽梵者，論師所解具有六義。	薄伽梵者，論師所解具有六義。	The Bhagavān has six meanings according to the master's explanation.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c15_18']	今此宗中，薄伽梵是能破義，如人執持利器多所摧伏。	今此宗中，薄伽梵是能破義，如人執持利器多所摧伏。	In this school, the Bhagavān has the meaning of being able to destroy, like a person holding a sharp weapon that can subdue many.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c17_1']	其本未有此名，世議觀其事迹，故號為能破者。	其本未有此名，世議觀其事迹，故號為能破者。	Its origin did not have this name, but the world observes its events and deeds, thus calling it the destroyer.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c18_1']	世尊亦爾，以大智明，破一切識心無明煩惱。	世尊亦爾，以大智明，破一切識心無明煩惱。	The World-Honored One is also like this. With the bright great wisdom, he destroys the ignorance and afflictions in the minds of all consciousnesses.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c19_10']	此等本自無生亦無相貌，然慧日出時暗惑自除，是故義名為破。	此等本自無生亦無相貌，然慧日出時暗惑自除，是故義名為破。	These are originally unborn and also have no appearance, but when the sun of wisdom arises, the dark delusions are naturally removed. Therefore, the meaning is called destruction.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c20_6']	《釋論》亦云「婆伽名破，婆名能破。	《釋論》亦云「婆伽名破，婆名能破。	The Śāstra also says, Bhagavān means destruction, and bhagavān means being able to destroy.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c20_18']	能破婬怒癡，故名婆伽婆。	能破婬怒癡，故名婆伽婆。	Being able to destroy lust, anger, and delusion, it is called bhagavān.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c22_1']	二乘雖破三毒，亦不了了盡，如盛香器餘氣故在。	二乘雖破三毒，亦不了了盡，如盛香器餘氣故在。	Although the two vehicles have destroyed the three poisons, they have not completely exhausted them, like the remaining fragrance in a fragrant vessel.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c22_18']	又如草木薪火，以力薄故，灰炭不盡。	又如草木薪火，以力薄故，灰炭不盡。	It is also like firewood and charcoal, which are not completely burned due to their weak power.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c23_19']	如來如劫燒火，一切都盡無烟無炭，故名婆伽婆。	如來如劫燒火，一切都盡無烟無炭，故名婆伽婆。	The Tathāgata is like a fire at the end of an eon, completely burning everything without any smoke or charcoal, and is therefore called Bhagavān.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c25_5']	」復次帝釋聲論，謂女人為薄伽，是欲求因緣能息煩惱義。	」復次帝釋聲論，謂女人為薄伽，是欲求因緣能息煩惱義。	Next, in the Vedic language, bhagavān means a woman, which means the cause and condition for seeking desire can extinguish afflictions.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c25_12']	又是所從生義。	又是所從生義。	It also means the meaning of what is born from.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c26_3']	金剛頂宗，即翻此義。	金剛頂宗，即翻此義。	In the Vajra Peak school, this meaning is reversed.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c27_8']	云女人者，即是般若佛母，無礙知見人，皆悉從是生。	云女人者，即是般若佛母，無礙知見人，皆悉從是生。	It is said that a woman is the mother of prajñā and the Buddha, and all those with unobstructed knowledge and insight are born from her.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0579c29_6']	其有志求因緣，得與相應，煩惱戲論皆悉永息，非如世間欲熱雖小止息而實更增也。	其有志求因緣，得與相應，煩惱戲論皆悉永息，非如世間欲熱雖小止息而實更增也。	Those who aspire to seek the cause and condition can attain harmony with her, and all afflictions and disputes will be permanently extinguished, unlike in the world where the heat of desire is temporarily quelled but actually increases again.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0580a01_11']	以密教不可直宣故，多有如是隱語，學者當觸類思之。	以密教不可直宣故，多有如是隱語，學者當觸類思之。	Because the secret teachings cannot be directly proclaimed, there are many such hidden words. Learners should think about them by touching on the similarities.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0580a03_6']	又薄伽梵者，即帶有聲，如人多有資財名持資財者，以有金故名持金者。	又薄伽梵者，即帶有聲，如人多有資財名持資財者，以有金故名持金者。	Bhagavat also carries the meaning of having, just as a person with much wealth is called a wealth-holder, and one who possesses gold is called a gold-holder.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0580a05_1']	以如來具殊勝德故名持眾德者，《釋論》亦云「婆伽言德、婆者言有，是名有德。	以如來具殊勝德故名持眾德者，《釋論》亦云「婆伽言德、婆者言有，是名有德。	Because the Tathagata possesses supreme virtues, he is called a virtue-holder. The Treatise on the Interpretation of the Buddha's Intention also says, Bhagavat means virtue, and bhava means having, thus it is called having virtue.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0580a05_18']	婆伽名名聲、婆者言有，是名有名聲。	婆伽名名聲、婆者言有，是名有名聲。	Bhagavat means fame, and bhava means having, thus it is called having fame.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0580a06_15']	」一切世間無有德名聲如佛者，則其義也。	」一切世間無有德名聲如佛者，則其義也。	 There is no one in the entire world whose virtue and fame are like the Buddha's, which is the meaning of this.
['ZH_T39_1796_001:0580a07_11']	經中多譯為世尊，是歎德之總稱。	經中多譯為世尊，是歎德之總稱。	In the sutras, it is often translated as World-Honored One, which is a general term of praise for virtues.
