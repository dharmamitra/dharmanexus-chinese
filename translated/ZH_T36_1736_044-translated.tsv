['ZH_T36_1736_044:0337c08_11']	又八地之中，無明未盡亦是夢境，永斷夢妄思想念，無復諸大陰界入，唯佛一人，是故如來獨稱大覺。	又八地之中，無明未盡亦是夢境，永斷夢妄思想念，無復諸大陰界入，唯佛一人，是故如來獨稱大覺。	Moreover, within the eighth ground, since ignorance is not yet exhausted, it is also a dream-like realm. Permanently severing dream-like delusions and thoughts, and no longer having the various great aggregates, elements, and sense fields, only the Buddha is the one person who is thus called the Greatly Awakened One.
['ZH_T36_1736_044:0337c09_3']	疏「如夢度河」，即八地經。	疏「如夢度河」，即八地經。	The commentary says like dreaming of crossing a river, which is from the sutra on the eighth ground.

['ZH_T36_1736_044:0337c11_2']	故此釋云：	故此釋云：	Therefore, this resolves it by saying:
['ZH_T36_1736_044:0337c12_1']	所說法如實際，即此言說常同實際故。	所說法如實際，即此言說常同實際故。	The Dharma that is expounded is like the ultimate reality, because this speech is always the same as the ultimate reality.
