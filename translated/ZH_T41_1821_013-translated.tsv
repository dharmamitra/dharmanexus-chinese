Moreover, it is explained that the various fruits arise only due to the karma of sentient beings.

['ZH_T41_1821_013:0200c13_13']	或造雜業感內淨．外穢　或造純不淨業感內．外俱穢　或造純淨業感內．外俱淨　此皆由業不同。	或造雜業感內淨．外穢　或造純不淨業感內．外俱穢　或造純淨業感內．外俱淨　此皆由業不同。	The results they experience are different. Either they create shared pure karma and experience saffron and so on, or they create shared impure karma and experience poisonous thorns and so on. Or they create unshared pure karma and experience a pure internal body, or they create unshared impure karma and experience an impure internal body, or they create mixed karma and experience an impure internal body and a pure external body, or they create mixed karma and experience a pure internal body and an impure external body, or they create purely impure karma and experience an internal and external body that are both impure, or they create purely pure karma and experience an internal and external body that are both pure.

['ZH_T41_1821_013:0200c15_4']	若造雜業故所感果內穢．外淨。	若造雜業故所感果內穢．外淨。	If one creates mixed karma, then the internal is defiled and the external is pure.

['ZH_T41_1821_013:0200c17_5']	故與欝金等不可例同　若諸天等造純淨業。	故與欝金等不可例同　若諸天等造純淨業。	Therefore, it cannot be compared to saffron and so forth. If the gods and so forth create pure karma,
['ZH_T41_1821_013:0200c18_3']	故所感果內．外俱妙　言雜業純業者。	故所感果內．外俱妙　言雜業純業者。	then the internal and external of what they experience are both wonderful. The term mixed karma refers to

['ZH_T41_1821_013:0200c21_12']	造天善業雖亦起惑。	造天善業雖亦起惑。	Even though one creates heavenly good karma and also gives rise to afflictions,
['ZH_T41_1821_013:0200c22_4']	善勝惡劣故得純名。	善勝惡劣故得純名。	good karma is superior and evil karma is inferior, so it is called pure.

['ZH_T41_1821_013:0205a23_4']	此思種子不能動身發語表示內心名無表業。	此思種子不能動身發語表示內心名無表業。	this seed of volition is unable to move the body, emit speech, or indicate the inner mind, and is called non-manifest karma.
['ZH_T41_1821_013:0205a23_18']	依經部宗身．語二表是無記性。	依經部宗身．語二表是無記性。	According to the Sautrāntika school, the two kinds of manifest karma of body and speech are indeterminate in nature.
['ZH_T41_1821_013:0205a24_16']	思通三性故唯思業能熏成種表不能熏。	思通三性故唯思業能熏成種表不能熏。	Because volition is of three natures, only volition can perfume and produce seeds, while manifest karma cannot perfume.

['ZH_T41_1821_013:0211c10_14']	又此大種無有其餘執受相故。	又此大種無有其餘執受相故。	Moreover, these great elements do not have the characteristics of being grasped by others.

The seven branches of body and speech are each produced from one set of four great elements. The great elements that are the support are like the concentrated mind, which is also one without distinction.
['ZH_T41_1821_013:0211c13_4']	所以大種造隨心戒亦一四大造。	所以大種造隨心戒亦一四大造。	Therefore the great elements that produce the precepts that follow the mind are also produced from one set of four great elements.
