He is not obstructed by the true and real Dharma, is not obstructed by the wisdom of the essential meaning of the sages, is not obstructed by the wisdom and eloquence, and is not obstructed by the wisdom of illuminating understanding. This is called the bodhisattva's practice of unobstructed wisdom. He surpasses the multitudes and decisively resolves mental doubts to attain the unconditioned, and together with innumerable and incalculably numerous types of sentient beings, universally causes them to be liberated and forever dwell in peace and security. He eliminates the notion of permanence and contemplates impermanence, and then severs attachment to desire and attachment to form and formlessness.

First, remove attachment to the body and do not give rise to thoughts. These five aggregates, this body, are impure with leaking bonds. The eyes are like water bubbles and are also not solid or true.

With attachment to the six sense faculties, there are then deluded actions, up to old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and myriad sufferings. One comes and goes, circling in the three realms, flowing into the five paths without end.
