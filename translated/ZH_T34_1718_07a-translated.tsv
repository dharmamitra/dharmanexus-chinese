The produced and moistened are all useful, but the medicinal herbs have strong uses. All contaminated wholesome [dharmas] can eliminate evil, with the uncontaminated being the best. Among the uncontaminated [dharmas], the four great disciples used parables to deeply understand the Sage's mind. The Buddha praised them, saying it was extremely rare. He described their understanding using parables, thus it is called the Chapter on the Parable of the Medicinal Herbs.
['ZH_T34_1718_07a:0090c03_13']	夫藥草叢育日久，一蒙雲雨扶疏暐曄，芽莖豐蔚於外，力用充潤於內，譬諸無漏住最後身有餘涅槃，更不願求無上佛道；	夫藥草叢育日久，一蒙雲雨扶疏暐曄，芽莖豐蔚於外，力用充潤於內，譬諸無漏住最後身有餘涅槃，更不願求無上佛道；	Medicinal herbs grow in abundance for a long time. Once they receive the clouds and rain, they flourish and shine, with abundant buds and stems on the outside, and their power and function are fully nourished on the inside. This is a parable for those with uncontaminated [dharmas] who dwell in their final body with remaining nirvāṇa, no longer wishing for the unsurpassed Buddha path;
['ZH_T34_1718_07a:0090c06_11']	今得聞經自乘佛乘兼以運人，文云「我等今日真是聲聞」，以佛道聲令一切聞，內外自他具勝力用，故稱「藥草喻品」。	今得聞經自乘佛乘兼以運人，文云「我等今日真是聲聞」，以佛道聲令一切聞，內外自他具勝力用，故稱「藥草喻品」。	Now, having heard the sutra, one rides the Buddha vehicle and also transports others. The text says, We are truly the disciples of the Buddha today, using the sound of the Buddha's path to make everyone hear. Internally and externally, oneself and others, are endowed with superior power and function, so it is called the Chapter on the Parable of the Herbs.

Now, having suddenly become a medicine king under the clouds and rain, by ingesting it one universally cures all illnesses and transforms the body into an immortal. The analogy is like the uncontaminated hearing of the sutra, breaking through the delusions of ignorance and opening the Buddha's insight. The text says, We are truly the Buddha's disciples today. The unsurpassed treasure trove is obtained without seeking. What the Buddha's disciples should attain, they have all attained. Facing the Buddha, they receive the prophecy. It is remarkable and called subtle, so it is called the Chapter on the Parable of the Herbs.
