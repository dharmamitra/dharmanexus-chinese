['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a10_7', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a10_11', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a10_13']	答。🔽云何者。🔽徵。	答。 云何者。 徵。	This is the question.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a11_17']	上兩句明別解脫。	上兩句明別解脫。	The first two lines clarify the separate liberation.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a12_6']	下兩句明定．道。	下兩句明定．道。	The last two lines clarify the concentrations and the path.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a15_3']	謂受善戒離惡根本．加行．後起故。	謂受善戒離惡根本．加行．後起故。	Because one accepts good precepts and abandons the fundamental, preparatory, and subsequent actions of evil.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a15_13']	於發惡處還發得善戒。	於發惡處還發得善戒。	In the case of giving rise to evil, one still gives rise to good precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a16_8']	從二得者至性罪遮罪者。	從二得者至性罪遮罪者。	Obtaining from two means obtaining from natural offenses and prohibited offenses.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a16_13']	釋從二得。	釋從二得。	The commentary explains obtaining from two.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a17_1']	謂從二類得。	謂從二類得。	It means obtaining from two categories.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a17_11']	一從情．非情類處得。	一從情．非情類處得。	One obtains from the category of sentient beings and non-sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a18_11']	二從發性罪．遮罪類處得　又解言二類者。	二從發性罪．遮罪類處得　又解言二類者。	Two obtains from the category of natural offenses and prohibited offenses. Another explanation says the two categories are:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a18_17']	有兩種二類。	有兩種二類。	There are two kinds of two categories.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a19_4']	一有情類。	一有情類。	One is the category of sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a19_9']	二非情類。	二非情類。	Two is the category of non-sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a19_14']	一性罪類。	一性罪類。	One is the category of natural offenses.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a20_7']	二遮罪類　又解言二類者。	二遮罪類　又解言二類者。	Two is the category of prohibited offenses. Another explanation says the two categories are:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a20_19', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a22_8']	一有情類能發性罪．遮罪。🔽二非情類能發性罪．遮罪　今受善戒能離性罪及與遮罪故。	一有情類能發性罪．遮罪。 二非情類能發性罪．遮罪　今受善戒能離性罪及與遮罪故。	One is the category of sentient beings that can give rise to natural offenses and prohibited offenses.🔽Two is the category of non-sentient beings that can give rise to natural offenses and prohibited offenses. Now, accepting good precepts can abandon natural offenses and prohibited offenses.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a23_6']	從二類發性罪．遮罪處還發得善戒。	從二類發性罪．遮罪處還發得善戒。	Therefore, in the case of giving rise to good precepts from the category of natural offenses and prohibited offenses, one still gives rise to good precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a23_14']	故正理三十九云。	故正理三十九云。	Therefore, the Thirty-Nine of Correct Principles says:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a24_5']	於情性罪謂殺等業。	於情性罪謂殺等業。	Natural offenses towards sentient beings refer to actions such as killing.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a24_14']	遮謂女人同室宿等。	遮謂女人同室宿等。	The prohibited [acts] refer to things like sleeping in the same room as a woman.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a25_4']	非情性罪謂盜外財。	非情性罪謂盜外財。	The offenses of a nature that are not related to sentient beings refer to stealing external property.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a26_8']	從現得者至有情處故者。	從現得者至有情處故者。	As for because it is obtained from the present, in the case of sentient beings,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a26_17']	釋從現得此別解脫。	釋從現得此別解脫。	it explains that this individual liberation is obtained from the present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a27_16']	於三世中謂從現世蘊．處．界．發得。	於三世中謂從現世蘊．處．界．發得。	Among the three times, it is obtained from the present aggregates, sense bases, and elements.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a28_3']	非從去．來。	非從去．來。	It is not obtained from the past or future.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a28_8']	所以者何。	所以者何。	Why is this?
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a28_18']	由此律儀於現有情轉。	由此律儀於現有情轉。	Because this discipline operates on present sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230a29_16']	及於現有情所依止處轉　於現有情轉者。	及於現有情所依止處轉　於現有情轉者。	And it operates on the present bases of sentient beings. Operating on present sentient beings means
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b01_6', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b02_1']	謂從有情邊發戒。🔽如邪欲等從守護有情得罪。	謂從有情邊發戒。 如邪欲等從守護有情得罪。	that precepts are obtained from sentient beings.🔽It is like the case of deviant desires, where one commits offenses based on guarding sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b03_12']	若離邪欲等從守護有情發戒隨其所應　於現有情所依止處轉者。	若離邪欲等從守護有情發戒隨其所應　於現有情所依止處轉者。	If one abstains from deviant desires, etc., one obtains precepts based on guarding sentient beings as appropriate. Operating on the present bases of sentient beings means
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b03_18']	有情所依處。	有情所依處。	the bases of sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b04_3']	謂內身。	謂內身。	It refers to the internal body.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b04_10']	有情所依止處。	有情所依止處。	The bases of sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b05_5']	謂外器　於現有情所依處者。	謂外器　於現有情所依處者。	It refers to the external environment. Operating on the present bases of sentient beings means🔽.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b06_1']	於現有情內所依身發得此戒。	於現有情內所依身發得此戒。	The precepts are obtained in relation to the present sentient beings who are the basis of support of the body.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b06_12']	如行殺等從所依處得罪。	如行殺等從所依處得罪。	If one commits killing, etc., one commits offenses in relation to the basis of support.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b07_6']	若離殺等從所依處發戒。	若離殺等從所依處發戒。	If one abstains from killing, etc., one obtains precepts in relation to the basis of support.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b08_3']	隨其所應　於現有情所止處者。	隨其所應　於現有情所止處者。	As appropriate. In relation to the present sentient beings who are the abode,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b08_16']	於現有情外所止器發得此戒。	於現有情外所止器發得此戒。	the precepts are obtained in relation to the present sentient beings who are the abode of the environment.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b09_9']	如掘地等從所止處得罪。	如掘地等從所止處得罪。	If one digs the ground, etc., one commits offenses in relation to the abode.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b10_17']	若不掘地等從所止處發戒隨其所應　去．來非是有情。	若不掘地等從所止處發戒隨其所應　去．來非是有情。	If one does not dig the ground, etc., one obtains precepts in relation to the abode, as appropriate. Past and future sentient beings do not exist,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b11_9']	亦非是有情所依止處。	亦非是有情所依止處。	and they are also not the abode of sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b12_1']	故不能發別解脫戒。	故不能發別解脫戒。	Therefore they cannot give rise to the precepts of individual liberation.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b12_6', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b12_11']	故正理云。🔽有情處者。	故正理云。 有情處者。	Therefore the correct principle says:🔽The abode of sentient beings
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b13_4']	謂諸有情及諸有情所依止處。	謂諸有情及諸有情所依止處。	refers to all sentient beings and the abode of all sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b13_11', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b13_20']	現蘊．處．界。🔽內者即是有情所依。	現蘊．處．界。 內者即是有情所依。	The present aggregates, sense bases, and elements.🔽The internal is the basis of support of sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b14_8']	外者名為有情所止。	外者名為有情所止。	The external is called the abode of sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b15_14']	非過．未故　問若從現在有情處得如盜現在窣堵波物。	非過．未故　問若從現在有情處得如盜現在窣堵波物。	Because it is not past or future. If one obtains it from a present sentient being, then stealing the property of a present stūpa would be a pārājika offense.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b16_8']	婆沙一百一十三評家云。	婆沙一百一十三評家云。	The arbiter in the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra says:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b17_12']	如是說者於佛處得　准彼正義於過去佛邊結罪。	如是說者於佛處得　准彼正義於過去佛邊結罪。	Those who say this obtain it from the Buddha. According to their correct interpretation, one commits an offense in relation to past Buddhas.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b19_3']	如何乃言於現有情處得　解云評家理應望現守護者邊結罪。	如何乃言於現有情處得　解云評家理應望現守護者邊結罪。	How can it be said that one obtains it from present sentient beings? The explanation is that the arbiter should reasonably say that one commits an offense in relation to the present guardian.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b19_12']	而言於佛結彼罪者。	而言於佛結彼罪者。	But it is said that one commits that offense in relation to the Buddha.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b21_6']	以施佛故顯物重故推在如來　又解評家意說罪．福二門非皆齊等。	以施佛故顯物重故推在如來　又解評家意說罪．福二門非皆齊等。	Because one gives to the Buddha, it shows that the object is heavy, and it is attributed to the Tathāgata. Another explanation is that the arbiter's intention says that the two aspects of offense and merit are not all equal.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b21_16']	若論發戒現有情處得。	若論發戒現有情處得。	If discussing the arising of precepts, one obtains them from present sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b22_13']	若論結罪無妨亦有於過去佛處得。	若論結罪無妨亦有於過去佛處得。	If discussing the committing of offenses, there is no obstruction in also obtaining them from past Buddhas.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b23_9']	若得靜慮至況從遮罪者。	若得靜慮至況從遮罪者。	If one obtains the meditative absorptions, how much more so for the precepts from proscribed offenses?
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b23_15']	釋從根本得。	釋從根本得。	The explanation is that one obtains them from the fundamental [precepts].
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b24_15']	若得定．道戒應知但從發根本業道處得。	若得定．道戒應知但從發根本業道處得。	If discussing the precepts of meditative absorption and the path, one should know that one obtains them only from the place where one gives rise to the fundamental karmic paths.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b25_15']	尚不從彼發加行．後起處得道．定戒。	尚不從彼發加行．後起處得道．定戒。	One does not obtain the morality of the samādhi and the fixed samādhi from the place of the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b26_8']	況從發遮罪處得此律儀。	況從發遮罪處得此律儀。	How much less does one obtain this moral restraint from the place of the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.🔽This is a heavy matter, and the light is also so.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b27_12']	此即舉重況輕也　又解別解律儀教制遮罪故。	此即舉重況輕也　又解別解律儀教制遮罪故。	Also, the moral restraint of the prātimokṣa is taught and prohibited in the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b28_3']	從遮罪處發得遮戒。	從遮罪處發得遮戒。	Therefore, one obtains the moral restraint of the prātimokṣa from the place of the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230b29_1']	定．道律儀無教制遮罪故無別遮戒。	定．道律儀無教制遮罪故無別遮戒。	The moral restraint of the samādhi and the fixed samādhi is not taught and prohibited in the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts, and therefore there is no separate moral restraint of the prātimokṣa.🔽Because there is no separate moral restraint of the prātimokṣa, one does not obtain it from the place of the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.🔽Why is it that the moral restraint of the prātimokṣa is also obtained from the place of the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts, but the moral restraint of the samādhi and the fixed samādhi is not?
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c02_17']	由無別遮戒不從遮罪處發　問別解脫律儀何故亦從加行．後起處得非定．道律儀　解云別解律儀教制加行．後起罪故。	由無別遮戒不從遮罪處發　問別解脫律儀何故亦從加行．後起處得非定．道律儀　解云別解律儀教制加行．後起罪故。	The moral restraint of the prātimokṣa is taught and prohibited in the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c03_8']	從加行．後起處發。	從加行．後起處發。	Therefore, one obtains it from the place of the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c03_18']	定．道律儀無教制故。	定．道律儀無教制故。	The moral restraint of the samādhi and the fixed samādhi is not taught and prohibited.🔽Therefore, one does not obtain it from the place of the preliminary and subsequent activity of the precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c05_14']	所以不於加行．後起處得　又解散位律儀於散位中加行．根本．後起三位。	所以不於加行．後起處得　又解散位律儀於散位中加行．根本．後起三位。	Also, in the scattered state, the moral restraint of the scattered state is in the three states of preliminary, fundamental, and subsequent activity.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c06_6']	皆容得有別解律儀現行。	皆容得有別解律儀現行。	The practice of the moral restraint of the prātimokṣa is possible in all of them.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c07_4']	如受大戒加行等中有勤策戒等故。	如受大戒加行等中有勤策戒等故。	It is like the case of the preparatory stage of the full ordination, in which there is the morality of the novice monk.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c07_16']	得戒時通於三種起惡處得。	得戒時通於三種起惡處得。	When one obtains morality, it is obtained in the three kinds of actions.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c08_12']	定位律儀於定位中唯在根本起。	定位律儀於定位中唯在根本起。	Morality of the meditative state is only in the fundamental ground of the meditative state.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c09_9']	即根本故不在加行．後起位中。	即根本故不在加行．後起位中。	Because it is only in the fundamental ground, it is not in the preparatory or subsequent stages.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c10_1']	於定前．後無此戒故。	於定前．後無此戒故。	Because there is no such morality before or after the meditative state.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c10_14']	故得戒時唯於一種起惡處得。	故得戒時唯於一種起惡處得。	Therefore, when one obtains morality, it is obtained in only one kind of action.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c11_1']	故正理云。	故正理云。	Therefore the correct principle says:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c12_1']	若得靜慮．無漏律儀應知但從根本業道。	若得靜慮．無漏律儀應知但從根本業道。	If one obtains the regulation of the meditative state and the pure regulation, one should know that it is only obtained from the fundamental path of action.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c12_12']	以定中唯有根本業道故。	以定中唯有根本業道故。	Because in the meditative state there is only the fundamental path of action.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c13_4', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c14_17']	非從前．後近分而得。🔽以在定位唯有根本在不定位中無此律儀故　又解散位律儀於散位中。	非從前．後近分而得。 以在定位唯有根本在不定位中無此律儀故　又解散位律儀於散位中。	It is not obtained from the preliminary stages before or after.🔽Because in the meditative state there is only the fundamental, and in the non-meditative state there is no such regulation.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c15_10']	有加行．根本．後起故。	有加行．根本．後起故。	Moreover, the regulation of the dispersed state is in the preparatory, fundamental, and subsequent stages of the dispersed state.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c16_3']	得戒時通於三種起惡處得。	得戒時通於三種起惡處得。	Therefore, when one obtains morality, it is obtained in the three kinds of actions.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c16_12']	定位律儀於定位中。	定位律儀於定位中。	The regulation of the meditative state is in the fundamental ground of the meditative state.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c17_2']	無有加行．後起。	無有加行．後起。	There is no preparatory or subsequent stage.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c17_8']	起即根本故。	起即根本故。	Because the arising is the fundamental stage.🔽When precepts are obtained, they are only obtained in relation to the one type of arising of evil.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c18_13']	得戒時唯於一種起惡處得　又解散戒．定戒俱對除惡。	得戒時唯於一種起惡處得　又解散戒．定戒俱對除惡。	Moreover, the precepts of non-concentration and the precepts of concentration are both obtained in relation to the elimination of evil.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c19_4']	惡與散戒同欲界故。	惡與散戒同欲界故。	Because evil and the precepts of non-concentration are in the same realm of desire.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c19_10']	以相去近故。	以相去近故。	Because they are close to each other.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c19_15']	難防護故。	難防護故。	Because they are difficult to guard.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c20_1']	故得散戒。	故得散戒。	Therefore, the precepts of non-concentration are obtained.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c20_10']	通於三種起惡處得。	通於三種起惡處得。	They are obtained in relation to the three types of arising of evil.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c21_1']	惡與定戒不同界故。	惡與定戒不同界故。	Because evil and the precepts of concentration are in different realms.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c21_6']	相去遠故。	相去遠故。	Because they are far apart from each other.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c21_11']	易防護故。	易防護故。	Because they are easy to guard.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c21_16']	故得定戒。	故得定戒。	Therefore, the precepts of concentration are obtained.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c22_5']	唯於一種起惡處得。	唯於一種起惡處得。	They are only obtained in relation to the one type of arising of evil.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c23_5']	釋從恒時得。	釋從恒時得。	The explanation is that the time of obtaining is obtained.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c23_17']	謂從三世蘊．處．界得故。	謂從三世蘊．處．界得故。	Because it is obtained in relation to the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c24_13']	名從恒時得　問何故別解唯於現得。	名從恒時得　問何故別解唯於現得。	It is called obtaining from the time of obtaining. The question is why the precepts of individual liberation are only obtained in the present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c25_15']	定．道二戒通過．未　解云別解律儀依教受得。	定．道二戒通過．未　解云別解律儀依教受得。	The two precepts of concentration and the path are obtained in the past and future. The explanation is that the precepts of individual liberation are obtained through accepting the teachings.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c26_8']	教意唯防現在故唯現在發。	教意唯防現在故唯現在發。	The intention of the teaching is only to prevent the present, therefore it is only generated in the present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c26_17']	定道二戒不依教受。	定道二戒不依教受。	The two precepts of concentration and the path are not received according to the teaching.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c28_3']	隨心而生故通三世發　又解隨心轉戒其力是強。	隨心而生故通三世發　又解隨心轉戒其力是強。	Because they arise in accordance with the mind, they are generated in the three times. Another explanation: the power of the precepts that accompany the mind is strong.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0230c28_18']	通防三世故於三世蘊．處．界得。	通防三世故於三世蘊．處．界得。	Because they universally prevent the three times, they are obtained in the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a01_3']	別解不爾故唯於現得　又解此戒俱心皆成三世故。	別解不爾故唯於現得　又解此戒俱心皆成三世故。	The precepts of individual liberation are not like this, therefore they are only obtained in the present. Another explanation: because the mind that accompanies these precepts all becomes the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a01_17']	心俱戒通於三世蘊．處．界得。	心俱戒通於三世蘊．處．界得。	Therefore the precepts that accompany the mind are obtained in the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the three times.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a02_15']	故正理云從恒時者。	故正理云從恒時者。	Therefore the Nyāyapraveśa says:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a03_12']	謂從過去未來現在蘊．處．界得。	謂從過去未來現在蘊．處．界得。	From the eternal time means that they are obtained in the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the past, future, and present.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a06_1']	戒與彼心俱有因故。	戒與彼心俱有因故。	Because the precepts are the co-existent cause of that mind.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a06_17']	通三世蘊．處．界得。	通三世蘊．處．界得。	they are obtained in the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a07_1']	別解不爾。	別解不爾。	The prātimokṣa is not like this.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a07_6']	唯防現在。	唯防現在。	It only prevents the present.🔽It is only obtained in the present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a07_18']	唯現處得　又解如戒俱心。	唯現處得　又解如戒俱心。	Another explanation: Like the mind associated with precepts,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a08_8']	及心俱戒皆斷三世。	及心俱戒皆斷三世。	and the precepts associated with the mind, all sever the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a09_5']	以說斷律儀斷欲惡戒及能起惑。	以說斷律儀斷欲惡戒及能起惑。	Because it is said that the prātimokṣa severs the unwholesome precepts of desire and the afflictions that give rise to them.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a09_10']	以此明知。	以此明知。	By this, it is clearly known.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a09_15']	戒斷三世。	戒斷三世。	The precepts sever the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a10_7']	由心俱戒能斷三世故。	由心俱戒能斷三世故。	Because the precepts associated with the mind can sever the three times,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a10_15']	亦通於三世法得。	亦通於三世法得。	they are also obtained in relation to dharmas of the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a11_7']	別解脫不爾故唯現得。	別解脫不爾故唯現得。	The prātimokṣa is not like this, so it is only obtained in the present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a11_12']	非能斷故。	非能斷故。	Because it cannot sever [the past and future].
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a12_7']	由此差別至加行後起者。	由此差別至加行後起者。	For this reason, there is a distinction between the preparatory and subsequent actions.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a13_11']	以別解脫律儀對定．道二律儀發處差別應作四句。	以別解脫律儀對定．道二律儀發處差別應作四句。	The prātimokṣa precepts should be distinguished from the two precepts of concentration and the path in terms of the place where they are produced, and four sentences should be made.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a14_16']	有蘊．處．界從彼唯得別解律儀非餘定．道二律儀等。	有蘊．處．界從彼唯得別解律儀非餘定．道二律儀等。	There are aggregates, sense bases, and elements from which only the prātimokṣa precepts are obtained, not the other two precepts of concentration and the path, etc.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a16_11']	第四句中不言遮罪略而不說　又婆沙一百二十。	第四句中不言遮罪略而不說　又婆沙一百二十。	Also, in the one hundred and twentieth fascicle of the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a17_10']	作四句中第一句不言遮罪者亦略不論。	作四句中第一句不言遮罪者亦略不論。	In the four alternatives, the first does not mention the proscribed offenses, and also does not discuss them in brief.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a18_5']	非於正得至防護過現者。	非於正得至防護過現者。	As for the present, up to guarding against past and present offenses,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a18_16']	論主彈前第一第三句云。	論主彈前第一第三句云。	the author of the treatise refutes the first and third alternatives, saying:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a19_14']	非於正得善律儀時可有現在惡業道。	非於正得善律儀時可有現在惡業道。	When one is properly obtaining wholesome restraint, one cannot have present evil karmic paths,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a20_4']	及加行．後起。	及加行．後起。	as well as the preparatory and subsequent actions,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a20_9']	並諸遮罪。	並諸遮罪。	and all the proscribed offenses.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a20_18']	何故乃言第一句中。	何故乃言第一句中。	Why then does the first alternative say:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a21_7']	從現在加行．後起。	從現在加行．後起。	From the present preparatory and subsequent actions,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a21_12']	及諸遮罪。	及諸遮罪。	and all the proscribed offenses,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a22_4']	第三句從現世根本業道。	第三句從現世根本業道。	The third alternative says: From the present fundamental karmic paths.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a22_9']	彈訖正云。	彈訖正云。	After the refutation, it is correctly said:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a22_17']	是故第一句應言。	是故第一句應言。	Therefore, the first alternative should say:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a23_12']	從現在加行後起及諸遮罪處。	從現在加行後起及諸遮罪處。	From the present preparatory and subsequent actions, and all the proscribed offenses.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a25_3']	第三句應言從現在根本業道處　此中且正第一．第三句。	第三句應言從現在根本業道處　此中且正第一．第三句。	The third alternative should say: From the present fundamental karmic paths. Here, the first and third alternatives are just corrected.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a25_12']	理實四句皆加處字。	理實四句皆加處字。	In reality, all four alternatives should add the word place.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a27_8']	遮罪處。	遮罪處。	The context of the proscribed offenses.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a27_13']	正訖又云。	正訖又云。	It is also said:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a28_3', 'ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a28_16']	若據發戒有通三世。🔽若論防護理應但說防護未來。	若據發戒有通三世。 若論防護理應但說防護未來。	If one speaks of the origination of precepts, they extend to the three time periods.🔽If one discusses their protection, it should only be said that they protect the future.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a29_9']	定不應言防護過．現。	定不應言防護過．現。	It is definitely not appropriate to say that they protect the past and present.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231a29_19']	現在已生。	現在已生。	The present has already arisen.🔽There is no need to protect them.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b01_9']	不須防故　正理救云。	不須防故　正理救云。	The Nyāyānusāra-śāstra rescues this by saying:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b02_3']	於業道等處置業道等聲。	於業道等處置業道等聲。	The context of karmic paths and so forth uses the terms karmic paths and so forth.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b02_12']	故前四句義亦無失。	故前四句義亦無失。	Therefore, the meaning of the previous four phrases is also not lost.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b03_9']	由如是理亦通防護過．現業道等。	由如是理亦通防護過．現業道等。	By this principle, it also extends to the protection of karmic paths and so forth of the past and present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b03_15']	非唯防未來。	非唯防未來。	It is not only the protection of the future.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b04_8']	以業道等聲說彼依處故。	以業道等聲說彼依處故。	This is because the terms karmic paths and so forth refer to their bases.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b05_4']	若異此者則應但說防護未來。	若異此者則應但說防護未來。	If it were otherwise, then one would only speak of the protection of the future.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b06_5']	律儀但能防未來罪令不起故非防過．現。	律儀但能防未來罪令不起故非防過．現。	The precepts can only prevent future offenses and cause them not to arise. They do not prevent the past and present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b07_15']	已滅．已生律儀於彼無防用故　解云於能發不善業道等所依境處。	已滅．已生律儀於彼無防用故　解云於能發不善業道等所依境處。	because the precepts that have already ceased and those that have already arisen do not have the function of preventing those objects.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b08_8']	說能依不善業道等聲。	說能依不善業道等聲。	The explanation is that the voice of the precepts that are based on the objects that give rise to unwholesome karmic paths, etc.,🔽is spoken of.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b09_4']	從不善業道等所依境處發戒故。	從不善業道等所依境處發戒故。	Because the precepts are produced from the objects that are the basis for the unwholesome karmic paths, etc.,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b09_14']	說從不善業道等發戒。	說從不善業道等發戒。	it is said that the precepts are produced from the unwholesome karmic paths, etc.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b10_6']	故前四句義亦無失。	故前四句義亦無失。	Therefore, the meaning of the previous four statements is also without error.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b11_4']	由如是不善業道所依境處通三世理。	由如是不善業道所依境處通三世理。	By this principle, the objects that are the basis for the unwholesome karmic paths are common to the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b11_17']	亦通防護過．現不善業道等。	亦通防護過．現不善業道等。	They are also common to the prevention of the unwholesome karmic paths, etc., of the past and present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b12_17']	以能於過．現不善業道所依境處發律儀時。	以能於過．現不善業道所依境處發律儀時。	Because when the precepts are produced in the objects that are the basis for the unwholesome karmic paths, etc., of the past and present,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b13_10']	即防護過．現不善業道。	即防護過．現不善業道。	they immediately prevent the unwholesome karmic paths, etc., of the past and present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b13_15']	所依境處。	所依境處。	The objects that are the basis.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b14_4']	不令發不善業等。	不令發不善業等。	They do not allow the production of unwholesome karmic paths, etc.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b14_17']	亦說防護過．現不善業道等。	亦說防護過．現不善業道等。	They are also said to prevent the unwholesome karmic paths, etc., of the past and present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b15_4']	以業道等聲。	以業道等聲。	Because the voice of the karmic paths, etc.,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b15_18']	說彼不善業道等所依境界處故。	說彼不善業道等所依境界處故。	speaks of the objects that are the basis for those unwholesome karmic paths, etc.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b16_13']	若異此防護不善業道所依境處。	若異此防護不善業道所依境處。	If it were otherwise, and the basis of the unwholesome karmic paths were guarded against,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b17_9']	唯說防護能依不善業道體者。	唯說防護能依不善業道體者。	and only the body of the unwholesome karmic paths that are the support were guarded against,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b18_7']	即應但說唯未來法發唯防護未來。	即應但說唯未來法發唯防護未來。	then it would only be said that only future dharmas are produced and only the future are guarded against.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b19_3']	律儀但能防未來罪令不起故。	律儀但能防未來罪令不起故。	Because the precepts can only guard against future offenses and prevent them from arising.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b19_15']	非防過．現不善業道等體。	非防過．現不善業道等體。	They do not guard against the bodies of the unwholesome karmic paths of the past and present.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b20_1']	過去已滅。	過去已滅。	The past has already ceased.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b20_6']	現在已生。	現在已生。	The present has already arisen.🔽The precepts have no preventing function towards them to make them not arise.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b21_7']	律儀於彼無有防用令不起故　俱舍師破云。	律儀於彼無有防用令不起故　俱舍師破云。	The Abhidharma masters refute this, saying:
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b22_7']	唯加處字於義無疑何故不加廣勞異釋。	唯加處字於義無疑何故不加廣勞異釋。	By simply adding the word basis, there is no doubt about the meaning. Why not add it? It is troublesome to give different explanations.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b22_17']	豈從彼世法發得律儀。	豈從彼世法發得律儀。	How can one obtain precepts from dharmas of the three times?
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b23_8']	即防彼世惡業道等。	即防彼世惡業道等。	One obtains precepts from dharmas of the three times, and the precepts guard against evil karmic paths of the three times.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b24_8']	發戒雖復通於三世防過無防唯在未來。	發戒雖復通於三世防過無防唯在未來。	Obtaining precepts is common to the three times, but guarding against the past is only in the future.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b24_15']	反難令防未來。	反難令防未來。	The counter-argument is to make one guard against the future.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0231b25_4']	此乃誠如所說。	此乃誠如所說。	This is indeed as stated.

If one relies on the correct principles, the precepts of concentration have relinquishment through separation from defilements.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239a03_4']	由離染位捨退分故。	由離染位捨退分故。	Because in the state of separation from defilements, one relinquishes the part that is subject to regression.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239a03_17']	以彼退分與彼煩惱相出入故。	以彼退分與彼煩惱相出入故。	Because that part subject to regression comes in and out of association with those defilements.

['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239b28_10']	不成彼心戒亦隨捨有斷善捨　惡戒不爾。	不成彼心戒亦隨捨有斷善捨　惡戒不爾。	When that mind is not formed, the precepts are also abandoned. There is abandonment through severing the roots of goodness. Evil precepts are not like this.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239c01_13']	無斷善捨　問於惡戒中何故無斷惡捨　解云求惡戒心是不善惑斷彼惑時必得定戒。	無斷善捨　問於惡戒中何故無斷惡捨　解云求惡戒心是不善惑斷彼惑時必得定戒。	There is no abandonment through severing the roots of goodness. Question: Why is there no abandonment through severing evil in the case of evil precepts? Explanation: The mind seeking evil precepts is an unwholesome affliction. When one severs that affliction, one necessarily obtains the precepts of concentration.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239c02_5']	得定戒已必捨惡戒。	得定戒已必捨惡戒。	Having obtained the precepts of concentration, one necessarily abandons the evil precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239c03_15']	無有斷彼惑已不得定戒故無斷惡捨　又解得戒義當斷惡捨。	無有斷彼惑已不得定戒故無斷惡捨　又解得戒義當斷惡捨。	There is no case of severing that affliction without obtaining the precepts of concentration, so there is no abandonment through severing evil. Another explanation: The meaning of obtaining the precepts is equivalent to abandoning evil.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239c04_11']	得善戒時雖復猶成求惡戒心。	得善戒時雖復猶成求惡戒心。	When one obtains wholesome precepts, even though one still forms the mind seeking evil precepts,
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239c07_7']	以不成彼惡戒體故名為斷惡　斷惡捨雖成求惡戒心由得善戒故能捨惡戒名為斷惡捨．　斷善捨善。	以不成彼惡戒體故名為斷惡　斷惡捨雖成求惡戒心由得善戒故能捨惡戒名為斷惡捨．　斷善捨善。	because one does not form the substance of those evil precepts, it is called severing evil. Although the abandonment through severing evil still forms the mind seeking evil precepts, because one obtains wholesome precepts, one is able to abandon evil precepts, so it is called abandonment through severing evil. Abandonment through severing the roots of goodness is wholesome.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239c07_16']	非由惡戒能捨善戒。	非由惡戒能捨善戒。	It is not due to evil precepts that one is able to abandon wholesome precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_015:0239c08_4']	但由邪見故。	但由邪見故。	But it is only due to wrong views.

Because the precepts have a time limit of days and nights, they are abandoned at the end of the night. Because the evil precepts have no time limit of days and nights, they are not abandoned at the end of the night. At death.
