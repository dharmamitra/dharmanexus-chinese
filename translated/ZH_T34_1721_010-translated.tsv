['ZH_T34_1721_010:0593c28_8']	釋安樂行凡有六門：	釋安樂行凡有六門：	Explaining the Peaceful and Joyful Practices has six aspects:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0593c28_14', 'ZH_T34_1721_010:0593c28_20']	一、來意門；🔽二、釋名門；	一、來意門； 二、釋名門；	1. The aspect of purpose;🔽2. The aspect of explaining the name;

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a01_6']	來意門者亦有二義：	來意門者亦有二義：	The aspect of purpose has two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a01_16']	一者成前，二者開後。	一者成前，二者開後。	1. Fulfilling what came before; 2. Opening up what comes after.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a02_4']	成前者凡有三意：	成前者凡有三意：	Fulfilling what came before has three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a02_16']	一者、佛教聲聞凡有三事：	一者、佛教聲聞凡有三事：	1. The Buddha's teachings for śrāvakas have three things:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a03_15']	一、令迴小入大發菩提心，則上三周說是也；	一、令迴小入大發菩提心，則上三周說是也；	1. Causing them to turn from the small to enter the great and give rise to the bodhi mind, which is explained in the three chapters above;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a04_11']	二、令修菩薩行，則四安樂行是也；	二、令修菩薩行，則四安樂行是也；	2. Causing them to cultivate bodhisattva practices, which are the four peaceful and joyful practices;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a05_5']	三、令得佛果，後〈壽量〉文是也。	三、令得佛果，後〈壽量〉文是也。	3. Causing them to attain the fruit of Buddhahood, which is the chapter on lifespan that comes later.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a05_16']	為此因緣故有今品來也。	為此因緣故有今品來也。	For these causes and conditions, this chapter exists.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a06_7']	二者、妙法蓮華凡有二種：	二者、妙法蓮華凡有二種：	2. The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower has two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a06_15']	一者、善巧用門；	一者、善巧用門；	First, the skillful means gate;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a07_2']	二者、真實體門。	二者、真實體門。	Second, the true reality gate.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a09_1']	上破三辨一謂對治之用，三病既廢一藥亦除，欲顯不一不三無二正觀即妙法華體。	上破三辨一謂對治之用，三病既廢一藥亦除，欲顯不一不三無二正觀即妙法華體。	Above, breaking down the three to reveal the one is called the function of counteracting. Since the three illnesses are eliminated, the one medicine is also removed. It wishes to reveal the wondrous Dharma Flower Sutra, which is neither one nor three, and is the correct contemplation that is not two.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a11_6']	下偈云「觀一切法空如實相亦不行不分別」，則知三一兩捨、緣觀並忘，今欲攝用歸體故有此品來也。	下偈云「觀一切法空如實相亦不行不分別」，則知三一兩捨、緣觀並忘，今欲攝用歸體故有此品來也。	The verse below says, Contemplating all dharmas as empty and the true nature, one does not engage in practice and does not discriminate. This shows that both the three and the one are abandoned, and both the object and contemplation are forgotten. Now, wishing to gather the function and return to the essence, this chapter comes.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a14_16']	三者、〈持品〉末云「惡世弘經被毀辱誹謗受諸苦惱」，小行之流多生退沒不能弘經，是故今明安住四行雖居惡世常受快樂，今欲示末世弘經模軌故說此品。	三者、〈持品〉末云「惡世弘經被毀辱誹謗受諸苦惱」，小行之流多生退沒不能弘經，是故今明安住四行雖居惡世常受快樂，今欲示末世弘經模軌故說此品。	Third, at the end of the Chapter on Upholding, it says, In the evil world, propagating the sutra will lead to slander and suffering. Those of lesser practice will often give rise to retreat and submersion, and will not be able to propagate the sutra. Therefore, now it clarifies abiding in the four practices, and although dwelling in the evil world, always experiencing happiness. Now, wishing to show the model and standard for propagating the sutra in the latter age, this chapter is spoken.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a16_3']	二、生後者，將明遠壽之果，故今說遠壽之因即四行是也。	二、生後者，將明遠壽之果，故今說遠壽之因即四行是也。	Second, as for giving rise to what follows, it will clarify the fruition of distant longevity, and therefore now speaks of the cause of distant longevity, which is precisely the four practices.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a17_13']	二、釋名門者，釋四行名不同，今依竺道生及《注法華經》辨四行者：	二、釋名門者，釋四行名不同，今依竺道生及《注法華經》辨四行者：	Second, in the section on explaining the names, the explanations of the names of the four practices are different. Now, based on Zhu Daosheng and the commentary to the Lotus Sutra, the four practices are distinguished:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a17_19']	一、空寂行；	一、空寂行；	First, the practice of emptiness and tranquility;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a18_3']	二、無憍慢行；	二、無憍慢行；	Second, the practice of being free from arrogance and pride;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a18_10']	三、離嫉妬行；	三、離嫉妬行；	Third, the practice of being free from jealousy and envy;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a18_16']	四、慈悲行。	四、慈悲行。	Fourth, the practice of compassion and kindness.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a22_2']	第一前明空寂行者，空寂即是諸法實相、波若正觀，既乖實相理則便有苦無樂，與理相應則便有樂無苦，今正明弘經安樂之義，是故初明空寂行也。	第一前明空寂行者，空寂即是諸法實相、波若正觀，既乖實相理則便有苦無樂，與理相應則便有樂無苦，今正明弘經安樂之義，是故初明空寂行也。	The first, the practice of emptiness and tranquility, emptiness and tranquility are precisely the true characteristics of all dharmas and the correct contemplation of prajñā. Since one deviates from the principle of true characteristics, there is suffering and no joy. When one accords with principle, there is joy and no suffering. Now, it is precisely explaining the meaning of peace and joy in promoting the sūtra, therefore, the practice of emptiness and tranquility is explained first.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a23_17']	雖內修空觀，但始行之人觀力未成，處眾說法多恃解陵物，是故次明離憍慢行。	雖內修空觀，但始行之人觀力未成，處眾說法多恃解陵物，是故次明離憍慢行。	Although one cultivates the contemplation of emptiness internally, but for beginners, the power of contemplation is not yet accomplished. When dwelling in the assembly and expounding the Dharma, one often relies on one's understanding to look down on others. Therefore, the practice of being free from arrogance and pride is explained next.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a25_18']	夫為師匠若恃解陵他則忌他勝己，蓋是有識之常情、為弘經之巨患，是故次明離嫉妬行。	夫為師匠若恃解陵他則忌他勝己，蓋是有識之常情、為弘經之巨患，是故次明離嫉妬行。	As a teacher, if one relies on one's understanding to look down on others, then one will resent others surpassing oneself. This is the usual attitude of those with consciousness and a great affliction for propagating the sutra, therefore, the next clarifies the practice of leaving jealousy.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a27_1']	通法之人雖無憍慢嫉妬，但所化之流凡有二種：	通法之人雖無憍慢嫉妬，但所化之流凡有二種：	A person who thoroughly understands the Dharma may be without arrogance and jealousy, but those who are transformed by him are generally of two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594a27_13']	一、求大道，二、執小乘。	一、求大道，二、執小乘。	First, those who seek the great way, second, those who adhere to the lesser vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b01_3']	於此二人多生愛恚，若起愛恚則癡使隨之，故須於學大乘者當起慈心，於非菩薩宜生愍側，是故次辨菩薩慈悲行。	於此二人多生愛恚，若起愛恚則癡使隨之，故須於學大乘者當起慈心，於非菩薩宜生愍側，是故次辨菩薩慈悲行。	For these two types of people, they often give rise to love and anger. If love and anger arise, then the afflictions of delusion will follow. Therefore, one should give rise to a compassionate mind towards those who study the Mahayana, and should give rise to pity towards those who are not bodhisattvas. Therefore, the next clarifies the practice of compassion and pity of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b02_12']	義不盡者文當具足，通稱安樂行者，安住四法則便得樂故稱安樂。	義不盡者文當具足，通稱安樂行者，安住四法則便得樂故稱安樂。	The meaning that is not exhausted will be fully explained in the text. The general term practitioner of peace and joy is because if one peacefully abides in the four dharmas, one will then attain joy, thus it is called peace and joy.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b03_9']	行者涉行之義，謂心行此四法也。	行者涉行之義，謂心行此四法也。	Practitioner means the meaning of engaging in practice, which refers to the mind engaging in these four dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b04_6']	第三、開合門者，開成四行、合但二門：	第三、開合門者，開成四行、合但二門：	Third, the gate of opening and combining. Opening it becomes four practices, combining it is only two gates:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b04_18']	初一是智慧，後三為功德。	初一是智慧，後三為功德。	The first is wisdom, and the latter three are merit.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b05_17']	心安福慧弘道利人則便得樂，謂福慧一雙也。	心安福慧弘道利人則便得樂，謂福慧一雙也。	If one's mind is at ease, merit and wisdom flourish, and one benefits others through the Way, then one will attain happiness. This is the pair of merit and wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b07_2']	二者、雖有四行不出得離二門，得門之中有兩種德：	二者、雖有四行不出得離二門，得門之中有兩種德：	Second, although there are four practices, they do not go beyond the two gates of attainment and liberation. Within the gate of attainment, there are two kinds of virtues:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b07_14']	空寂是智慧，慈悲為功德；	空寂是智慧，慈悲為功德；	Emptiness and quiescence are wisdom, and compassion is merit.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b08_9']	中間二種稱之為離，故離門亦兩：	中間二種稱之為離，故離門亦兩：	The two in the middle are called liberation, so the gate of liberation also has two:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b08_15']	、一離憍慢；	、一離憍慢；	First, liberation from arrogance;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b08_21']	二、離嫉妬。	二、離嫉妬。	Second, liberation from jealousy.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b09_5']	謂得離一雙也。	謂得離一雙也。	This is the pair of attainment and liberation.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b10_18']	三者、雖有四行不出空有二行，初一是空行，餘三為有行，謂空有一雙也。	三者、雖有四行不出空有二行，初一是空行，餘三為有行，謂空有一雙也。	Third, although there are four practices, they do not go beyond the two practices of emptiness and existence. The first is the practice of emptiness, and the remaining three are the practice of existence. This is the pair of emptiness and existence.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b12_13']	四者、雖有四行不出自行化他，初三為自行，慈悲是化他，謂自行化他一雙也。	四者、雖有四行不出自行化他，初三為自行，慈悲是化他，謂自行化他一雙也。	Fourth, although there are four practices, they do not go beyond one's own practice and guiding others. The first three are one's own practice, and compassion is guiding others. This is the pair of one's own practice and guiding others.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b15_6']	第四、體相門者，第一行以畢竟空觀為體，第二行以無憍慢心為體，第三行以無嫉妬心為體，第四行以慈悲心為體。	第四、體相門者，第一行以畢竟空觀為體，第二行以無憍慢心為體，第三行以無嫉妬心為體，第四行以慈悲心為體。	Fourth, the gate of essence and characteristics: the first practice takes the contemplation of ultimate emptiness as its essence, the second practice takes the mind free from arrogance as its essence, the third practice takes the mind free from jealousy as its essence, and the fourth practice takes the mind of compassion as its essence.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b16_5']	然此四行唯一正觀，約用不同故開四種：	然此四行唯一正觀，約用不同故開四種：	However, these four practices are only one true contemplation, which is divided into four types according to its different functions:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b21_1']	觀實相義名空寂行，即此正觀離過之義謂無憍慢嫉妬，即此空觀拔苦與樂故名慈悲，慈悲心不礙畢竟空、畢竟空不妨慈悲，雖行慈悲常畢竟空、畢竟空不捨慈悲，是故超凡越聖稱菩薩行也，亦是空悲二道。	觀實相義名空寂行，即此正觀離過之義謂無憍慢嫉妬，即此空觀拔苦與樂故名慈悲，慈悲心不礙畢竟空、畢竟空不妨慈悲，雖行慈悲常畢竟空、畢竟空不捨慈悲，是故超凡越聖稱菩薩行也，亦是空悲二道。	Contemplating the meaning of the true aspect is called the practice of emptiness and quiescence. This very true contemplation, the meaning of being free from faults, is called being free from arrogance and jealousy. This very contemplation of emptiness, extracting suffering and bestowing happiness, is called compassion. The mind of compassion does not obstruct ultimate emptiness, and ultimate emptiness does not hinder compassion. Although practicing compassion, one is always ultimately empty; ultimate emptiness does not abandon compassion. Therefore, it transcends the ordinary and surpasses the sages, and is called the practice of the bodhisattva, which is also the two paths of emptiness and compassion.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b21_17']	《大品》云「菩薩住二法魔不能壞：	《大品》云「菩薩住二法魔不能壞：	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, The bodhisattva abides in two dharmas, which cannot be destroyed by Māra:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b21_23']	一者、知空；	一者、知空；	First, knowing emptiness;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b22_7']	二、不捨眾生」。	二、不捨眾生」。	Second, not abandoning sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b28_8']	第五、階位門者，從初發心乃至佛地五十二位皆具四行，其中自有成與未成及功用無功用義，明昧淺深隨位差別，但經正意為接退沒之人，末世弘經多受苦惱，故令安住四法則便得樂，高位已上自具四行無俟說之，是故發心之人須依此品自行化他坐禪誦經懺悔。	第五、階位門者，從初發心乃至佛地五十二位皆具四行，其中自有成與未成及功用無功用義，明昧淺深隨位差別，但經正意為接退沒之人，末世弘經多受苦惱，故令安住四法則便得樂，高位已上自具四行無俟說之，是故發心之人須依此品自行化他坐禪誦經懺悔。	Fifth, the section on the stages. From the initial arousal of the mind up to the stage of Buddhahood, all fifty-two stages are endowed with the four practices. Within them, there are distinctions of accomplishment and non-accomplishment, as well as the principles of effort and effortless functioning. The distinctions of clarity and obscurity, shallow and deep, follow the differences in the stages. However, the main meaning of the sūtra is to connect with those who have fallen back. In the final age, those who propagate the sūtra will often suffer distress, so it is said that if one abides in the four methods, one will then attain happiness. Those in the higher stages are already endowed with the four practices, so there is no need to speak of them. Therefore, those who arouse the mind should rely on this chapter to practice and transform themselves, sit in meditation, recite the sūtra, and repent.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b29_5']	第六同異門者，〈法師品〉末明於三事：	第六同異門者，〈法師品〉末明於三事：	Sixth, the section on similarities and differences. At the end of the Dharma Teacher Chapter, three matters are clarified:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b29_12']	一、入慈悲室；	一、入慈悲室；	First, entering the room of compassion;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594b29_19']	二、著忍辱衣；	二、著忍辱衣；	Second, wearing the robe of patience;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c01_4']	三、諸法空為座。	三、諸法空為座。	Third, the seat of the emptiness of all dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c02_6']	與今四行義不同者，上文前明有行，次辨於空。	與今四行義不同者，上文前明有行，次辨於空。	The meaning of the four practices is different from this. The above text first clarifies the practice of existence, and then distinguishes emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c02_18']	所以然者，上品正釋法師。	所以然者，上品正釋法師。	The reason for this is that the previous chapter correctly explains the Dharma teacher.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c06_5']	夫為法師則為物說法宜前運慈悲，但慈悲之心久處生死多諸患難宜應行忍，雖有慈悲忍辱若不入空觀則慈悲忍不成，故次明空行，故從有入空。	夫為法師則為物說法宜前運慈悲，但慈悲之心久處生死多諸患難宜應行忍，雖有慈悲忍辱若不入空觀則慈悲忍不成，故次明空行，故從有入空。	As a Dharma master, one should speak the Dharma for others. One should first cultivate compassion. However, the mind of compassion dwells in birth and death for a long time and encounters many difficulties and hardships. One should practice forbearance. Although there is compassion and forbearance, if one does not enter the contemplation of emptiness, then compassion and forbearance are not accomplished. Therefore, the practice of emptiness is explained next. Therefore, one enters emptiness from existence.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c08_13']	此品正為惡世弘經多受苦惱心生退沒，故前明入畢竟空則不見身心，自他俱靜便得快樂，故初明空行；	此品正為惡世弘經多受苦惱心生退沒，故前明入畢竟空則不見身心，自他俱靜便得快樂，故初明空行；	This chapter is precisely for those who propagate the sutra in an evil world and who receive much suffering and distress. The mind gives rise to retreat and decline. Therefore, the entry into ultimate emptiness is explained first. One does not see body and mind, and oneself and others are both tranquil. One then attains joy and happiness. Therefore, the practice of emptiness is explained first.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c10_8']	以得空觀故能不起憍慢嫉妬，以得空觀故導成慈悲，故前明空行後辨有行。	以得空觀故能不起憍慢嫉妬，以得空觀故導成慈悲，故前明空行後辨有行。	Because one attains the contemplation of emptiness, one is able to give rise to arrogance and jealousy. Because one attains the contemplation of emptiness, one guides and accomplishes compassion. Therefore, the practice of emptiness is explained first, and the practice of existence is explained later.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c11_6']	又兩品欲示空有不二，故前後互說也。	又兩品欲示空有不二，故前後互說也。	Moreover, the two chapters wish to show that emptiness and existence are non-dual, and therefore they are explained alternately before and after.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c11_11']	就品為二：	就品為二：	The chapter is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c11_15']	一、問；	一、問；	First, the question;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c11_19']	二、答。	二、答。	Second, the answer.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c12_11']	二、問後。	二、問後。	Second, asking about the later.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c12_16']	答中亦二：	答中亦二：	The answer is also twofold:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c12_24']	初、總標四行名；	初、總標四行名；	First, it generally lists the names of the four practices;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c13_7']	二、別出四行體。	二、別出四行體。	Second, it specifically brings out the essence of the four practices.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c14_13']	「安住四法」者，心安住四法則無復苦，故得安樂，名安樂行。	「安住四法」者，心安住四法則無復苦，故得安樂，名安樂行。	Abiding in the four dharmas means that if the mind abides in the four practices, then there will be no more suffering, and one can attain peace and joy, which is called the practice of peace and joy.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c15_17']	「一者安住菩薩行處及親近處」下，第二、別出四行體。	「一者安住菩薩行處及親近處」下，第二、別出四行體。	The first is abiding in the bodhisattva's practice and the place of intimacy and below is the second, specifically bringing out the essence of the four practices.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c16_1']	又開四別：	又開四別：	It is further divided into four parts:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c16_8']	初、正明行體；	初、正明行體；	First, it clarifies the essence of the practice;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c16_13']	二、歎教；	二、歎教；	Second, it praises the teaching;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c16_18']	三、勸修；	三、勸修；	Third, it encourages cultivation;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c17_1']	四、總釋安樂義。	四、總釋安樂義。	Fourth, it comprehensively explains the meaning of peace and joy.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c17_11']	就出四行體即為四別。	就出四行體即為四別。	As for bringing out the essence of the four practices, it is divided into four parts.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0594c18_1']	就初行體又開為三：	就初行體又開為三：	As for the first essence of practice, it is further divided into three parts:

Practicing the forbearance of dharmas, he attains immeasurable wisdom. The forbearance of sentient beings refers to adverse and favorable conditions, etc. The bodhisattva is able to patiently endure them.

The emptiness of dharmas is already profound and receives the title of wisdom. This is based on the shallow and profound of the two emptinesses to distinguish merit and wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0595a17_13']	又俱就有門以明二忍，忍違順眾生為生忍，忍眾生違順等法為法忍，此二亦有淺深。	又俱就有門以明二忍，忍違順眾生為生忍，忍眾生違順等法為法忍，此二亦有淺深。	Furthermore, within the present existence, it clarifies the two forbearances. Forbearance of sentient beings who violate and accord is the forbearance of sentient beings. Forbearance of the dharmas of sentient beings who violate and accord, etc., is the forbearance of dharmas.

Second, it is able to give birth like the earth. Because one is able to forbear all humiliations and attain the great Dharma, myriad wholesome [activities] are born, therefore the mind of forbearance is called the ground.

Otherwise, one will fall into the stage of the two vehicles.

Because one enters emptiness, one does not practice any dharmas of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, etc.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0595b17_6']	「不分別」者，亦不分別行與不行也。	「不分別」者，亦不分別行與不行也。	Not discriminating means also not discriminating between practicing and not practicing.

Since the buddhas always teach the Dharma based on the two truths, therefore the bodhisattvas rely on the buddhas to cultivate and study, also making the contemplation of the two truths.

First, not practicing all dharmas is the emptiness of dharmas, and not discriminating between male and female is the emptiness of sentient beings. The reason for first clarifying the emptiness of dharmas and then discussing the emptiness of beings is that one is the sequential order of the teaching, and second, it is to remove the notion of a practitioner for those who are deluded. The Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom also has this text.

Therefore, it is called the contemplation of the middle way that is neither true nor conventional.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0595c02_9']	此三諦是因緣義，以不二言二，二名二諦，二不二為中道也。	此三諦是因緣義，以不二言二，二名二諦，二不二為中道也。	These three truths are the meaning of dependent origination. Using non-duality to speak of duality, duality is called the two truths, and duality and non-duality are the middle way.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0595c05_4']	所言緣盡觀者，一切顛倒邪緣皆盡於正觀內也。	所言緣盡觀者，一切顛倒邪緣皆盡於正觀內也。	What is meant by the exhaustion of conditions within contemplation is that all inverted and deviant conditions are exhausted within correct contemplation.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0595c05_18']	亦不行不分別者，觀盡於緣也。	亦不行不分別者，觀盡於緣也。	Neither practicing nor discriminating means the exhaustion of conditions within contemplation.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0595c06_19']	以邪緣既盡，正觀亦息，故緣觀並忘境智俱寂。	以邪緣既盡，正觀亦息，故緣觀並忘境智俱寂。	Since deviant conditions are already exhausted, correct contemplation also ceases. Therefore, both conditions and contemplation are forgotten, and objects and cognition are both quiescent.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0595c08_16']	後偈中亦有此意，初明生法二空謂盡緣，次偈言「不得諸法不知不見」即盡觀也。	後偈中亦有此意，初明生法二空謂盡緣，次偈言「不得諸法不知不見」即盡觀也。	The later verse also has this meaning. The first clarifies the emptiness of both arising and dharmas, which is the exhaustion of conditions. The next verse says not attaining, not knowing, and not seeing all dharmas is the exhaustion of contemplation.

Since sages have no wisdom of existence or non-existence, there is no mind internally. Externally there are no numbers, internally there is no mind.

The assembly of the transformed Buddhas clarifies that the Buddhis of the Pure Land are responsive and not real, in order to manifest that Śākyamuni is a trace and not the original. Therefore, it is called the manifestation of the one who can transform.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0599a21_6']	今舉所化顯能化者，涌出菩薩既多，即顯釋迦成佛來久，故名所化顯能化也。	今舉所化顯能化者，涌出菩薩既多，即顯釋迦成佛來久，故名所化顯能化也。	Now, by manifesting the transformed, it manifests the one who can transform. Since the bodhisattvas who emerge are numerous, it manifests that Śākyamuni has become a Buddha for a long time. Therefore, it is called the manifestation of the transformed manifesting the one who can transform.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0599a23_14']	二者、法身唯一，應身即多。	二者、法身唯一，應身即多。	Second, the Dharma body is one, while the responsive body is many.

This one meaning is still unclear, so the chapter on the emergence of the multitude is used to show that Śākyamuni's realization of the Dharma-body is long-standing. With these three aspects, the meaning is complete.

He only uses names and forms within the nameless and formless to provisionally speak of names and forms for the sake of sentient beings, and also distinguishes the body and life.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0599b04_2']	今品以去明佛壽命，身則不生滅、隨緣生滅，壽則無始無終、方便始終，辨此二門則果德究竟。	今品以去明佛壽命，身則不生滅、隨緣生滅，壽則無始無終、方便始終，辨此二門則果德究竟。	The chapter from here on clarifies the Buddha's life span. The body is unborn and unceasing, following conditions to be born and cease. Life has no beginning and no end, and is provisionally beginning and ending. Discussing these two aspects is the ultimate fruition of the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0599b05_15']	故肇師《涅槃論》云「六趣無以攝其生，力負無以化其體」，此明身無生滅也。	故肇師《涅槃論》云「六趣無以攝其生，力負無以化其體」，此明身無生滅也。	Therefore, Master ZHAO's Nirvana Treatise says, The six destinies cannot encompass its birth, and the power of carrying it cannot transform its body, which clarifies that the body has no birth or cessation.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0599b06_17']	「隨之不見其蹤，迎之罔眺其首」，謂壽無始終也。	「隨之不見其蹤，迎之罔眺其首」，謂壽無始終也。	Following it, one does not see its traces; welcoming it, one cannot see its head, referring to life having no beginning or end.

Now the bodhisattvas from the lower regions should follow the command and emerge to promote the sutra, so Maitreya's verses clarify the emerging bodhisattvas, saying to make offerings to the Buddha and protect and uphold this sutra, and so on, up to the beginning of the Chapter on Spiritual Powers, where the emerging bodhisattvas vow to promote the sutra, which is the evidence.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0599b23_10']	今廢始終之教，顯佛壽無始終，如烈地涌出。	今廢始終之教，顯佛壽無始終，如烈地涌出。	Now, abandoning the teachings of beginning and end, the Buddha's lifespan is revealed to be without beginning or end, like the emergence from the earth.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0599c09_5']	二乘既其是因，人天亦遠屬因攝。	二乘既其是因，人天亦遠屬因攝。	Since the two vehicles are the cause, the human and heavenly realms are also remotely included in the category of causes.

Because of the bodhisattvas emerging from the earth, they are able to reveal Shakyamuni's distant lifespan. Therefore, the bodhisattvas from other directions are taken as the distant causes and conditions, and the correct clarification of the emergence is taken as the proximate causes and conditions.

This is to clarify that the three sages together reveal the lifespan. First, due to Shakyamuni's command to uphold the sutra, second, the bodhisattvas wait until this chapter to respectfully request to uphold it, and third, Shakyamuni stops the request, therefore there are still the bodhisattvas who emerge from the earth revealing the lifespan.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0600a02_7']	故初分經有釋迦現瑞，彌勒生疑，文殊答問，三聖共開乘權乘實；	故初分經有釋迦現瑞，彌勒生疑，文殊答問，三聖共開乘權乘實；	Therefore, in the first part of the sutra, Shakyamuni manifests auspicious signs, Maitreya gives rise to doubts, and Manjushri answers the questions, the three sages together reveal the provisional and actual vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0600a03_2']	今亦三聖共開發身權身實也。	今亦三聖共開發身權身實也。	Now, it is also the three sages together revealing the provisional and actual bodies.

This is a mutual support between the beginning and end, not a contradiction.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0600a08_3']	是以前文命持故得弘經，後文止持故開遠壽，則是弘經也。	是以前文命持故得弘經，後文止持故開遠壽，則是弘經也。	Therefore, because of the previous text's command to uphold, he was able to propagate the sūtra; because of the later text's stopping of upholding, he revealed the distant life span, which is the propagation of the sūtra.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0601c01_7']	昔以權教覆實實則不顯，今開身權身實則真應義顯，如師子舒申義也。	昔以權教覆實實則不顯，今開身權身實則真應義顯，如師子舒申義也。	In the past, the provisional teachings covered the real, so the real was not revealed. Now, by revealing the provisional body and the real body, the meaning of the true and the responsive becomes evident, like the lion stretching and contracting.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0601c02_7']	昔為緣不堪故不說法身真實，故名有畏。	昔為緣不堪故不說法身真實，故名有畏。	In the past, because the conditions were not yet ripe, the Dharma body's true reality was not spoken of, so it was called fearful.

Although it manifests as long or short, it has never been long or short, so it is called inconceivable. If it was short in the past and long now, how could it be called inconceivable?

Therefore, the text below says, not real, not false, not so, not different. How can it be discriminated by permanence, impermanence, and so forth?

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c05_6']	然如來之壽實無長短，所以然者，既稱法身則以正法為身，正法豈是短之與長常、無常乃至五句可取耶？	然如來之壽實無長短，所以然者，既稱法身則以正法為身，正法豈是短之與長常、無常乃至五句可取耶？	However, the lifespan of the Tathāgata is truly neither long nor short. The reason for this is that since it is called the Dharma body, it takes the true Dharma as its body. How can the true Dharma be taken as short or long, permanent or impermanent, or even the five propositions?
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c05_17']	但隨所宜故有長短方便。	但隨所宜故有長短方便。	It is only because of following what is suitable that there is long and short skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c06_10']	昔非短說短，今非長說長。	昔非短說短，今非長說長。	In the past, it was not short but was said to be short, and now it is not long but is said to be long.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c09_16']	非短說短欲令識短是長短，非長說長欲令悟長是短長，若聞短不識長則不成於短，聞長不識短則亦不成長，如此障礙行心，失佛方便意也。	非短說短欲令識短是長短，非長說長欲令悟長是短長，若聞短不識長則不成於短，聞長不識短則亦不成長，如此障礙行心，失佛方便意也。	Not saying short as short is to make people recognize that short is long, and not saying long as long is to make people realize that long is short. If one hears short but does not recognize long, then short is not accomplished. If one hears long but does not recognize short, then long is also not accomplished. Such an obstructed mind of practice loses the Buddha's skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c11_6']	又所以昔說短今明長者，欲令眾生因此長短悟不長不短正法耳。	又所以昔說短今明長者，欲令眾生因此長短悟不長不短正法耳。	Moreover, the reason why the Buddha spoke of it as short in the past and now explains it as long is to enable sentient beings to realize the true Dharma of neither long nor short based on this length and shortness.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c12_2']	以悟不長不短，故有長短方便用。	以悟不長不短，故有長短方便用。	Because of realizing neither long nor short, there is the expedient use of length and shortness.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c14_9']	若言昔短既非、今長亦非，今長既是、昔短亦是，但非長非短，今因機緣宜歎為長，明今長為是、昔短則非。	若言昔短既非、今長亦非，今長既是、昔短亦是，但非長非短，今因機緣宜歎為長，明今長為是、昔短則非。	If it is said that the shortness of the past is not so, and the length of the present is also not so, and the length of the present is so, and the shortness of the past is also so, but it is neither long nor short, now due to the suitability of the circumstances, it is praised as long, clarifying that the length of the present is so, and the shortness of the past is not so.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0602c15_10']	如《涅槃經》云「不可言佛定是有為、定是無為」。	如《涅槃經》云「不可言佛定是有為、定是無為」。	As the Nirvana Sutra says, It cannot be said that the Buddha is definitely conditioned or definitely unconditioned.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a03_19']	一、用五時教者云，過去過塵沙、未來倍上數，猶是無常，終歸盡滅，故前云終歸於空，故如來壽有限量也。	一、用五時教者云，過去過塵沙、未來倍上數，猶是無常，終歸盡滅，故前云終歸於空，故如來壽有限量也。	First, those who use the teaching of the five periods say that the past is more numerous than dust and sand, and the future is twice as many, but it is still impermanent and will eventually perish. Therefore, it is said that it will return to emptiness, so the Tathagata's life span has a limit.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a05_3']	二、執四時教者云，此經覆相辨常，則覆相明壽無量也。	二、執四時教者云，此經覆相辨常，則覆相明壽無量也。	Second, those who adhere to the teaching of the four periods say that this sutra uses concealment to discuss permanence, so it uses concealment to clarify the immeasurable life span.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a06_12']	第三、半滿義者云，一切大乘經皆明佛常，謂顯了明佛壽無量也。	第三、半滿義者云，一切大乘經皆明佛常，謂顯了明佛壽無量也。	Third, those who use the meaning of the half and full teachings say that all Mahayana sutras clarify the Buddha's permanence, which is to say they explicitly clarify the immeasurable life span of the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a07_7']	今謂初謗經罪重，為下根人也；	今謂初謗經罪重，為下根人也；	Now, the first one slanders the sutra and the sin is grave, for the sake of those with inferior faculties;

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a13_1']	所言體者，法身超四句、絕百非，不可言常與無常等，故非量與無量，如《華嚴經》云「法界非有量亦復非無量，牟尼悉超越有量及無量」，法界則法身也。	所言體者，法身超四句、絕百非，不可言常與無常等，故非量與無量，如《華嚴經》云「法界非有量亦復非無量，牟尼悉超越有量及無量」，法界則法身也。	As for the essence, the Dharma body transcends the four propositions and the hundred negations, and cannot be said to be either permanent or impermanent, etc., therefore it is neither measurable nor immeasurable. As the Huayan Sutra says, The Dharma realm is neither measurable nor immeasurable. The Sage completely transcends the measurable and the immeasurable. The Dharma realm is the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a14_17']	又下文云「非實非虛非如非異」，《中論．觀如來品》云「寂滅相中無常無常等四句」。	又下文云「非實非虛非如非異」，《中論．觀如來品》云「寂滅相中無常無常等四句」。	Moreover, the text below says, It is neither real nor false, neither thus nor otherwise. The Zhong lun, in the chapter on contemplating the Tathāgata, says, Within the characteristics of quiescent extinction, there is neither permanence nor impermanence, and so on, the four propositions.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a16_18']	所言用者，非常非無常，昔為眾生故說為無常，故云「諸佛弟子眾尚捨無常身」，明佛壽有量。	所言用者，非常非無常，昔為眾生故說為無常，故云「諸佛弟子眾尚捨無常身」，明佛壽有量。	As for the term function, it is neither permanent nor impermanent. In the past, for the sake of sentient beings, it was said to be impermanent, hence it is said that even the disciples of the buddhas still abandon impermanent bodies, clarifying that the Buddha's lifespan has a limit.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a18_13']	今為破凡夫二乘執佛王宮實生、雙林實滅，故非常非無常歎美為常，顯佛壽無量。	今為破凡夫二乘執佛王宮實生、雙林實滅，故非常非無常歎美為常，顯佛壽無量。	Now, in order to refute the attachment of ordinary beings and the two vehicles that the Buddha truly took birth in the royal palace and truly entered extinction under the twin trees, it is said to be neither permanent nor impermanent, praising it as permanent, revealing that the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a27_18']	二、報身佛壽量有始無終，故下文云「我本行菩薩道所成壽命今猶未盡」，以行因滿初證佛果是故有始，一證已後湛然不滅故無有盡終。	二、報身佛壽量有始無終，故下文云「我本行菩薩道所成壽命今猶未盡」，以行因滿初證佛果是故有始，一證已後湛然不滅故無有盡終。	Second, the lifespan of the reward body Buddha has a beginning but no end, so the text below says, The lifespan I attained when I originally practiced the bodhisattva path is not yet exhausted. Because the fulfillment of the causes of practice initially realizes the fruition of Buddhahood, there is a beginning. Once realized, it remains eternally without extinction, so there is no end.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603a28_19']	三、法身佛壽本自在之，不生不滅無始無終。	三、法身佛壽本自在之，不生不滅無始無終。	Third, the lifespan of the Dharma body Buddha is originally free and independent, unborn and unceasing, without beginning or end.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b02_5']	明化身壽量謂開方便門，辨法報二身壽量謂顯真實義，故云壽量品。	明化身壽量謂開方便門，辨法報二身壽量謂顯真實義，故云壽量品。	It clarifies the lifespan of the transformation body, which is called opening the gate of skillful means, and it distinguishes the lifespans of the Dharma and reward bodies, which is called revealing the true meaning, so it is called the Chapter on Lifespan.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b02_12', 'ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b03_4']	今更四句釋之：🔽一、實而非權，謂法身壽也。	今更四句釋之： 一、實而非權，謂法身壽也。	Now, it is further explained in four statements:🔽First, it is real but not provisional, referring to the lifespan of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b03_17']	二、權而非實，謂化身壽也。	二、權而非實，謂化身壽也。	Second, it is provisional but not real, referring to the lifespan of the transformation body.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b04_8']	三、亦權亦實，謂報身壽也。	三、亦權亦實，謂報身壽也。	Third, both provisional and real, referring to the lifespan of the reward body.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b04_20']	報身即是應身，應身有二：	報身即是應身，應身有二：	The reward body is precisely the response body. The response body has two aspects:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b06_15']	一者內應，謂與法身相應，是故經云「諸佛所師所謂法也」，以法常故諸佛亦常。	一者內應，謂與法身相應，是故經云「諸佛所師所謂法也」，以法常故諸佛亦常。	First, inner response, referring to being in accord with the Dharma body. Therefore, the sutra says, The teacher of all buddhas is the Dharma. Because the Dharma is eternal, the buddhas are also eternal.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b07_19']	二者外應，謂與大機性相應，故為大菩薩於淨土中成佛。	二者外應，謂與大機性相應，故為大菩薩於淨土中成佛。	Second, outer response, referring to being in accord with the nature and characteristics of the great capacity. Therefore, for great bodhisattvas, the Buddha attains enlightenment in the Pure Land.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b09_2']	內應即實非權，外應謂權而非實，故云亦權亦實。	內應即實非權，外應謂權而非實，故云亦權亦實。	Inner response is real and not provisional. Outer response is provisional and not real. Therefore, it is said to be both provisional and real.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b11_9']	第四、非權非實，上之三門皆是無名相中假名相說，欲令眾生因此名相悟無名相，故泯上三門歸乎寂滅。	第四、非權非實，上之三門皆是無名相中假名相說，欲令眾生因此名相悟無名相，故泯上三門歸乎寂滅。	Fourth, neither provisional nor real. The above three approaches are all provisional names and characteristics within the nameless and formless. It is hoped that sentient beings will awaken to the nameless and formless through these names and characteristics. Therefore, the above three approaches are dissolved and return to quiescence.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b12_14']	第四、開合門者，經論之中說佛，開合不定，大明四句：	第四、開合門者，經論之中說佛，開合不定，大明四句：	Fourth, the approach of opening and combining. In the sutras and treatises, the Buddha is spoken of with indefinite opening and combining. The great illumination has four statements:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b13_20']	一、本迹俱合，二、本迹俱開，三、開本合迹，四、開迹合本。	一、本迹俱合，二、本迹俱開，三、開本合迹，四、開迹合本。	First, the original and traces are both combined; second, the original and traces are both revealed; third, revealing the original and combining the traces; fourth, revealing the traces and combining the original.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b14_16']	本迹俱合或合名一佛，謂三寶中一佛寶也。	本迹俱合或合名一佛，謂三寶中一佛寶也。	The original and traces are both combined or combined and called one Buddha, referring to the one Buddha treasure among the three treasures.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b16_4']	或開為二身，故云佛真法身猶如虛空，應物現形如水中月。	或開為二身，故云佛真法身猶如虛空，應物現形如水中月。	Or they are divided into two bodies, thus saying the true Dharma body of the Buddha is like empty space, and the form manifested in response to beings is like the moon in water.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b16_19']	既但有一迹一本，亦是本迹俱合。	既但有一迹一本，亦是本迹俱合。	Since there is only one trace and one original, this is also the original and traces both combined.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b17_9']	或開為三而三義不定：	或開為三而三義不定：	Or they are divided into three, but the three meanings are indefinite:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b18_13']	一者、如七卷《金光明》辨三佛者，一法、二應、三化。	一者、如七卷《金光明》辨三佛者，一法、二應、三化。	First, like the seven-fascicle Golden Light Sutra, which distinguishes three Buddhas: the first is the Dharma, the second is the response, and the third is the transformation.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b19_13']	法身為真，餘二為應，此則合真為一、開應為二。	法身為真，餘二為應，此則合真為一、開應為二。	The Dharma body is the true, and the other two are the response. This combines the true into one and divides the response into two.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b20_16']	二者、《法華論》列三佛，謂法、報與化，即是開真合應。	二者、《法華論》列三佛，謂法、報與化，即是開真合應。	Second, the Lotus Sutra Treatise lists three Buddhas, namely the Dharma, reward, and transformation, which is revealing the true and combining the response.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b21_6']	開真者，開法、報為二也。	開真者，開法、報為二也。	Revealing the true means revealing the Dharma and reward as two.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b22_18']	合應者以應身為一，此意明本有義為法身，酬因義名報，應物義名應也。	合應者以應身為一，此意明本有義為法身，酬因義名報，應物義名應也。	The combined response refers to the response body as one. This means that the inherent meaning is the Dharma body, the meaning of repaying causes is called retribution, and the meaning of responding to things is called response.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b23_11']	次開四佛者，此義亦有二種：	次開四佛者，此義亦有二種：	Next, the four buddhas are distinguished. This meaning also has two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0603b25_1']	一者、《楞伽經》明四佛，一應化佛，二功德佛，三智慧佛，四如如佛。	一者、《楞伽經》明四佛，一應化佛，二功德佛，三智慧佛，四如如佛。	First, the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra clarifies the four buddhas: the first is the transformation buddha, the second is the merit buddha, the third is the wisdom buddha, and the fourth is the suchness buddha.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0604c03_6']	一者、明無始始義，但始義長遠故不可數；	一者、明無始始義，但始義長遠故不可數；	First, it clarifies the meaning of having a beginning that is beginningless. It is only because the meaning of the beginning is long and distant that it is incalculable;
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0604c04_4']	二者、欲顯法身無始終義，故不可數也。	二者、欲顯法身無始終義，故不可數也。	Second, it is in order to manifest the meaning of the Dharma body being without beginning or end, therefore it is incalculable.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0604c04_19']	然始無始有不二二義、二不二義。	然始無始有不二二義、二不二義。	However, the beginning that is beginningless has the meaning of non-duality and duality, and the meaning of duality and non-duality.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0604c06_13']	不二二義者，初證法身是故有始，於三身中是應身，亦名報身，是故有始。	不二二義者，初證法身是故有始，於三身中是應身，亦名報身，是故有始。	The meaning of non-duality and duality is that the initial realization of the Dharma body is therefore the beginning. Within the three bodies, it is the response body, also called the reward body, therefore it has a beginning.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0604c07_10']	而所證法身此則無始，故是不二二義。	而所證法身此則無始，故是不二二義。	However, the Dharma body that is realized is beginningless, therefore it is the meaning of non-duality and duality.

The realization is also without beginning or end, because the realization realizes the realized. Since the realized has no beginning or end, the realization also has no beginning or end.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0604c12_3']	「自從是來」下，上辨證法身已久，今明垂應久義，以證法身久謂自德滿，垂應久謂化他德圓也。	「自從是來」下，上辨證法身已久，今明垂應久義，以證法身久謂自德滿，垂應久謂化他德圓也。	From that time onward - above it distinguishes the Dharma body as having been realized for a long time. Now it clarifies the meaning of the provisional response as having been for a long time, in order to prove that the Dharma body has been for a long time, which means the virtue of self-fulfillment is complete, and the provisional response has been for a long time, which means the virtue of transforming others is perfect.

Since realizing the Dharma body, if one is to be enlightened by the reward body, then he shows the reward body; if one is to be enlightened by the transformation body, then he shows the transformation body. Although he shows the two bodies, he actually has nothing to respond to; although he expounds all teachings, he actually has nothing to expound. This directly resolves Maitreya's doubts.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0604c19_13']	以垂應既久常在娑婆說法教化，故有千世界塵數菩薩，即是父老子少，非父少子老義也。	以垂應既久常在娑婆說法教化，故有千世界塵數菩薩，即是父老子少，非父少子老義也。	Since he has long manifested responses and always abides in the Saha world expounding the Dharma to teach and transform, there are bodhisattvas as numerous as dust motes in a thousand worlds.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0606a10_1']	既聞非實便謂同幻夢之虛，故次辨非虛。	既聞非實便謂同幻夢之虛，故次辨非虛。	Since they have heard that it is not real, they may think that it is the same as the falsity of illusions and dreams, so next it is distinguished that it is not false.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0606a11_2']	既聞非實非虛便謂冥真如等法性，故說非如。	既聞非實非虛便謂冥真如等法性，故說非如。	Since they have heard that it is not real and not false, they may think that it is the same as the Dharma nature of the profound true suchness, so it is said that it is not the same.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0606a11_18']	既聞非如便謂與如異體，故說非異。	既聞非如便謂與如異體，故說非異。	Since they have heard that it is not the same, they may think that it has a different essence from the true suchness, so it is said that it is not different.

The Tathāgata sees the three realms and is also able to see the three and the non-three. Therefore, the Fahua lun says, Not seeing the three realms as the three realms means that the Tathāgata is able to see and realize the true suchness of the Dharma body, which ordinary beings are unable to see.

Although it is not the three realms, it is still the three realms for sentient beings.

Not knowing this is called ignorance. Since the Tathāgata knows the three and the non-three, the three realms are precisely the Dharma body. He also knows the non-three and the three, and the Dharma body for sentient beings is precisely the three realms.

He also knows the non-three and the three, therefore there is prajna upapaya. Thus the Tathagata is fully endowed with the two wisdoms.

Not knowing the non-three and the three, they lack the wisdom of skillful means. Therefore ordinary beings have only annihilation and permanence, but lack the two wisdoms.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0606b01_14']	又上見三不三義故三界是法身，今見不三三義法身於眾生成三界，是故眾生有種種欲。	又上見三不三義故三界是法身，今見不三三義法身於眾生成三界，是故眾生有種種欲。	Moreover, above it sees the meaning of the three and the non-three, therefore the three realms are the Dharma body. Now it sees the meaning of the non-three and the three, the Dharma body becomes the three realms for sentient beings. Therefore sentient beings have various desires.

This is explained from the most serious to the least serious.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0606c07_18']	今開於長因，明長果長因謂顯真實義，辨短因短果即開方便門，如乘權乘實中亦明斯二，辨三因三果此是方便，一因一果名為真實也。	今開於長因，明長果長因謂顯真實義，辨短因短果即開方便門，如乘權乘實中亦明斯二，辨三因三果此是方便，一因一果名為真實也。	Now, the long causes are opened, and the long causes and long fruits are clarified, which is to reveal the true meaning. Distinguishing the short causes and short fruits is to open the provisional gate. It is also explained in the provisional vehicle and the true vehicle.

The above clarifies that the original vow is not yet fulfilled, so the Buddha cannot enter the eternal extinction of nirvāṇa without remainder. Therefore, using the original vow that is not yet fulfilled to explain the meaning of permanence, refuting the followers of the Lesser Vehicle who say that the Buddha is impermanent and eternally enters nirvāṇa without remainder, which would be contrary to the original vow.

['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609b25_19']	一者、釋疑故來。	一者、釋疑故來。	First, it comes to resolve doubts.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609b26_3']	時眾疑云：	時眾疑云：	The assembly at that time had doubts, thinking:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609b27_4']	現見火劫起時乾坤涸盡，如來之身寧得常存？	現見火劫起時乾坤涸盡，如來之身寧得常存？	We now see that when the fire kalpa arises, the universe dries up and perishes. How can the Tathagata's body remain forever?
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609b28_13']	是故今明土有淨穢，穢土被燒、淨土不滅，迹身現滅而法身常存。	是故今明土有淨穢，穢土被燒、淨土不滅，迹身現滅而法身常存。	Therefore, it is now explained that there are pure and defiled lands. The defiled land is burned, but the pure land does not perish. The trace body appears to be extinguished, but the Dharma body remains forever.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c01_4']	二者、上論如來真應兩身辨正果已竟，今次論淨穢兩土辨佛依果。	二者、上論如來真應兩身辨正果已竟，今次論淨穢兩土辨佛依果。	Second, the discussion of the Tathagata's true and response bodies to discern the true fruit has already been completed. Now, the discussion of the pure and defiled lands to discern the Buddha's dependent fruit follows.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c01_19']	正果之義，應身示滅、法身不滅；	正果之義，應身示滅、法身不滅；	The meaning of true fruit is that the response body shows extinction while the Dharma body does not extinguish.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c02_13']	依果之義，穢土自毀、淨土不燒。	依果之義，穢土自毀、淨土不燒。	The meaning of dependent fruit is that the defiled land is destroyed by itself while the pure land is not burned.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c03_14']	故身但本迹、土唯淨穢，欲辨斯義故有此文來也。	故身但本迹、土唯淨穢，欲辨斯義故有此文來也。	Therefore, the body is only the original and trace, and the land is only pure and defiled. In order to discern this meaning, this text comes.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c04_7']	此品既有淨土，今略論之。	此品既有淨土，今略論之。	Since this chapter already has a Pure Land, I will briefly discuss it now.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c05_7']	《法華論》釋此品明有三身，今對三身亦有三土：	《法華論》釋此品明有三身，今對三身亦有三土：	The Fahua Lun explains that this chapter clarifies the three bodies. Now, corresponding to the three bodies, there are also three lands:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c05_18']	一者、法身栖實相之土。	一者、法身栖實相之土。	First, the Dharma body dwells in the land of true suchness.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c07_13']	《普賢觀》云「釋迦牟尼名毘盧遮那遍一切處，其佛住處名常寂光」，即法身土。	《普賢觀》云「釋迦牟尼名毘盧遮那遍一切處，其佛住處名常寂光」，即法身土。	The Puxian Guan says, Shakyamuni is called Vairocana, pervading everywhere. The Buddha's abode is called the eternally quiescent light, which is the land of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c08_15']	故《仁王經》云「三賢十聖住果報，唯佛一人居淨土」。	故《仁王經》云「三賢十聖住果報，唯佛一人居淨土」。	Therefore, the Renwang Jing says, The three sages and ten saints abide in the land of fruition, only the Buddha alone dwells in the Pure Land.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c09_14']	《瓔珞經》云「亦以中道第一義名法身土」。	《瓔珞經》云「亦以中道第一義名法身土」。	The Yingluo Jing says, It is also called the middle way and ultimate truth, named the land of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c12_2']	然諸法寂滅相不可以言宣，孰論身與不身，亦何土與非土，但無名相中為眾生故假名相說，故明身與土。	然諸法寂滅相不可以言宣，孰論身與不身，亦何土與非土，但無名相中為眾生故假名相說，故明身與土。	However, the quiescent and extinguished characteristics of all dharmas cannot be proclaimed with words. How can one discuss the body and non-body, or the land and non-land? It is only in the nameless and formless that, for the sake of sentient beings, one provisionally speaks of names and forms. Therefore, the body and land are clarified.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c14_3']	雖開身土，二實未曾二，但約義不同故分為兩，能栖之義說之為身，所栖之義目之為土也。	雖開身土，二實未曾二，但約義不同故分為兩，能栖之義說之為身，所栖之義目之為土也。	Although the body and land are distinguished, they have never been two. They are only divided into two based on different meanings. The meaning of being able to dwell is called the body, and the meaning of being dwelled upon is called the land.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c15_13']	如七卷《金光明．三身品》具有如如智及如如境，就義而望境即土也。	如七卷《金光明．三身品》具有如如智及如如境，就義而望境即土也。	As the seven-fascicle Golden Light Sūtra's chapter on the three bodies states, it has both the wisdom of suchness and the realm of suchness. From the perspective of meaning, the realm is the land.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c16_1']	二者、報身報土。	二者、報身報土。	Second, the retribution body and retribution land.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c16_15']	但報身即是應身，應身有二種：	但報身即是應身，應身有二種：	But the retribution body is precisely the response body. The response body has two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c18_3']	一內、二外，內與法身相應名曰應身，此猶屬法身與法身同土。	一內、二外，內與法身相應名曰應身，此猶屬法身與法身同土。	first, internal; second, external. The internal, which accords with the Dharma body, is called the response body. This still belongs to the Dharma body and is the same land as the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c20_4']	《法華論》云「我淨土不毀而眾見燒盡」者，報佛如來真實淨土第一義攝，故此即是報身土也。	《法華論》云「我淨土不毀而眾見燒盡」者，報佛如來真實淨土第一義攝，故此即是報身土也。	The Lotus Sūtra Treatise says, My pure land is not destroyed, yet the assembly sees it burned to the end. The retribution Buddha Tathāgata's true pure land is subsumed within the ultimate truth, so this is precisely the retribution body and land.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c22_9']	若外應之義名為報身，化大菩薩於淨土成佛，此以寶玉為淨土，此土乃不為劫火所燒而終有盡滅。	若外應之義名為報身，化大菩薩於淨土成佛，此以寶玉為淨土，此土乃不為劫火所燒而終有盡滅。	If the meaning of responding to the external is called the reward body, then the transformed great bodhisattvas attaining Buddhahood in the pure lands, with their lands made of precious jewels, will eventually be destroyed, not being burned by the conflagration at the end of the eon.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c23_5']	所以然者，今開身有常無常三句：	所以然者，今開身有常無常三句：	The reason for this is that now the body is explained to have three aspects of permanence and impermanence:
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c24_16']	一者、法身但常非無常，二、化身但無常非常，三者、應身亦常亦無常。	一者、法身但常非無常，二、化身但無常非常，三者、應身亦常亦無常。	First, the Dharma body is only permanent and not impermanent; second, the transformation body is only impermanent and not permanent; third, the response body is both permanent and impermanent.
['ZH_T34_1721_010:0609c25_14']	內應身義名之為常，外應之義名為無常。	內應身義名之為常，外應之義名為無常。	The meaning of the internal response body is called permanence, while the meaning of the external response is called impermanence.

Therefore, it is said before that there is no birth and death, no regression or emergence, and so forth, up to not real, not false, not thus, not otherwise. It is known that it is neither permanent nor impermanent, neither long nor short, yet long and short are appropriate to conditions, and permanence and impermanence are skillful means.
