['ZH_T34_1723_08b:0806c29_16']	前引〈信解品〉云「今此經中唯說一乘」，此品又云「開方便門顯真實相」，即以一乘正為經宗，逗二乘者不定姓。	前引〈信解品〉云「今此經中唯說一乘」，此品又云「開方便門顯真實相」，即以一乘正為經宗，逗二乘者不定姓。	08b	The Chapter on Belief and Understanding previously quoted says In this sutra, only the One Vehicle is taught. This chapter also says Opening the provisional means and revealing the true aspect, which takes the One Vehicle as the main theme of the sutra, to attract those of the Two Vehicles who have not yet determined their spiritual capacity.
['ZH_T34_1723_08b:0807a03_7']	又并授記訖後十九品名為流通，流通此經非正逗二乘退大心者，更無開權顯實正說一乘之處。	又并授記訖後十九品名為流通，流通此經非正逗二乘退大心者，更無開權顯實正說一乘之處。	08b	Moreover, after the bestowal of predictions, the following nineteen chapters are called the dissemination. The dissemination of this sutra is not primarily for those of the Two Vehicles who have regressed from the Great Vehicle, as there is no place to further open the provisional and reveal the true, or to properly teach the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1723_08b:0807a05_14']	雖此品及〈持品〉漸有八部比丘尼等授記，因言總記，非更說一乘進令修學而與記故，皆是流通。	雖此品及〈持品〉漸有八部比丘尼等授記，因言總記，非更說一乘進令修學而與記故，皆是流通。	08b	Although in this chapter and the Chapter on Upholding there are gradually predictions for the eight divisions of monks, nuns, etc., they are general predictions based on their words, not predictions given after further teaching the One Vehicle and encouraging them to cultivate and study. Therefore, they are all part of the dissemination.

It is the secret and essential of the Buddhas, always well guarded. I have never revealed it before. The meaning is profound and far-reaching, and few give rise to faith, so this dissemination is more extensive than other sutras.
['ZH_T34_1723_08b:0807a16_1']	又化大機易可成熟，化迴心類稍難信解，故多流通種種勸勵。	又化大機易可成熟，化迴心類稍難信解，故多流通種種勸勵。	08b	Moreover, it is easy to mature those with great capacity for transformation, but it is slightly more difficult for those who have turned their minds to believe and understand.

['ZH_T34_1723_08b:0807a19_11']	〈寶塔〉一品顯法可重，說此經處塔涌聞法；	〈寶塔〉一品顯法可重，說此經處塔涌聞法；	08b	The Chapter on the Treasure Stupa shows that the Dharma is worthy of respect, as the sutpa emerges and hears the Dharma at the place where this sutra is expounded.
['ZH_T34_1723_08b:0807a21_12']	〈天授〉一品雖亦明法，意明能弘經人其人可重，為重法故於其人所不悋軀命以身為床。	〈天授〉一品雖亦明法，意明能弘經人其人可重，為重法故於其人所不悋軀命以身為床。	08b	Although the Chapter on Devadatta also clarifies the Dharma, its meaning shows that the person who can propagate the sutra is worthy of respect. In order to respect the Dharma, one does not begrudge one's body and life for the sake of that person, using one's body as a bed.
['ZH_T34_1723_08b:0807a22_14']	其〈持〉一品既矚此三，讚重義廣，遂願弘通。	其〈持〉一品既矚此三，讚重義廣，遂願弘通。	08b	The Chapter on Upholding observes these three, and the meaning of praise and respect is extensive. It finally vows to propagate and circulate.

Next, the Chapter on Practices for Attaining Peace and Security clarifies the practices for those who uphold the sūtra. Later, the Chapter on Upholding clarifies the one who can uphold. Therefore, all three are called the power of upholding.
