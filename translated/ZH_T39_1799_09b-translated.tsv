If there is something attained, but he is not yet able to use it, it is like a person afflicted by sleep paralysis, with hands and feet intact, seeing and hearing without confusion, but the mind is obstructed by a guest demon and cannot move. This is called the domain of the aggregate of sensation.

['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950b22_12']	見諸佛心者，妙覺明心觀中明露，即色相盡而色性現也。	見諸佛心者，妙覺明心觀中明露，即色相盡而色性現也。	09b	Seeing the mind of the buddhas means the wondrously enlightened mind is revealed in the contemplation, and form and appearance are exhausted while the nature of form is manifested.
['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950b23_7']	觀中暫見，非真實見，故如鏡像。	觀中暫見，非真實見，故如鏡像。	09b	Temporarily seeing in the contemplation is not true seeing, thus it is like a mirror image.

['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950b25_16']	既是觀心變影而緣，非是觀證，故未能用，以用受陰為領納故，親證必能有妙用故。	既是觀心變影而緣，非是觀證，故未能用，以用受陰為領納故，親證必能有妙用故。	09b	Since it is the mind contemplating the transformed image as the object, it is not yet the contemplation of realization, so it is not yet able to use it. Because the aggregate of perception is used for receiving and acknowledging, and because the direct realization must be able to have wondrous function.
['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950b27_1']	未破受陰如魘人，色陰盡故能見佛心，如見聞不惑。	未破受陰如魘人，色陰盡故能見佛心，如見聞不惑。	09b	Before the aggregate of perception is broken, it is like a person with sleep paralysis. Because the aggregate of form is exhausted, one can see the Buddha's mind, like seeing and hearing without delusion.
['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950b28_4']	受陰客邪既在，妙用之動未能，為受所覆，故云區宇。	受陰客邪既在，妙用之動未能，為受所覆，故云區宇。	09b	Since the guest-demon is still present, the movement of wondrous function is not yet able, because it is covered by perception. Therefore, it is said to be a restricted domain.

['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950c01_17']	「若魘咎歇，其心離身，返觀其面，去住自由，無復留礙，名受陰盡，是人則能超越見濁。	「若魘咎歇，其心離身，返觀其面，去住自由，無復留礙，名受陰盡，是人則能超越見濁。	09b	If the fault of sleep paralysis subsides, the mind leaves the body and looks back at one's face, coming and going freely without obstruction, this is called the exhaustion of the aggregate of perception. This person will then be able to transcend the turbidity of views.

['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950c04_18']	不為魘咎之所留礙，故能返照自面，此顯見聞有用也。	不為魘咎之所留礙，故能返照自面，此顯見聞有用也。	09b	Not being obstructed by the fault of sleep paralysis, one is able to reflect back on one's own face. This shows that seeing and hearing have a function.

['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950c07_17']	若約法者，受陰盡故心亡領納，既無能領之受，即無所領之法，心、法既亡，自在宜矣。	若約法者，受陰盡故心亡領納，既無能領之受，即無所領之法，心、法既亡，自在宜矣。	09b	If we discuss it in terms of the Dharma, since the aggregate of sensation is exhausted, the mind ceases to experience. Since there is no sensation that can be experienced, there is no dharma that is experienced. Since both the mind and dharmas are gone, one is naturally free.
['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950c10_11']	超見濁者，以根身正是見濁之體，見聞覺知擁令留礙，水火風土旋令覺知，斯則執受相仍便成根質，受妄領納執以為己。	超見濁者，以根身正是見濁之體，見聞覺知擁令留礙，水火風土旋令覺知，斯則執受相仍便成根質，受妄領納執以為己。	09b	As for transcending the turbidity of views, the body of the sense organs is precisely the substance of the turbidity of views. Seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing obstruct and hinder, while water, fire, wind, and earth cause one to be aware. This then means that the characteristics of grasping and clinging continue and form the substance of the sense organs. Sensation falsely experiences and grasps them as one's own.
['ZH_T39_1799_09b:0950c12_19']	以見是推求，執取為義，由受領前境，取著隨生，受陰既亡即超見濁，覺明之心虛通領納，故云虛明妄想。	以見是推求，執取為義，由受領前境，取著隨生，受陰既亡即超見濁，覺明之心虛通領納，故云虛明妄想。	09b	Since views are about investigating and grasping, and sensation experiences the objects in front, attachment arises accordingly. Since the aggregate of sensation is gone, one then transcends the turbidity of views. The mind of enlightened clarity is empty and penetrating in its experience, and thus it is called the false imagination of empty clarity.

If he excessively restrains himself internally, he may suddenly give rise to boundless compassion in that state, and even see mosquitoes and gadflies as if they were his own children.

Seeing all living beings is as if they were one's own newborn children.

The superior characteristics manifest before them, and they are overwhelmed with exhilaration. Suddenly, within this state, they give rise to boundless courage. Their mind becomes sharp and keen, and they aspire to be equal to all Buddhas, thinking they can transcend the three asaṃkhyeya kalpas in a single thought.
