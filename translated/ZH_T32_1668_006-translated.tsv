['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c17_3']	從上已來染淨諸法相熏相生不斷絕義決擇分已焉，自此已下分明顯示生滅門中三種大義。	從上已來染淨諸法相熏相生不斷絕義決擇分已焉，自此已下分明顯示生滅門中三種大義。	From above, the meaning of the continuous mutual perfuming and mutual production of defiled and pure dharmas has been decisively selected. From here on, the three great meanings in the arising and ceasing aspect are clearly revealed.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c18_2']	本曰：	本曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c20_7']	復次真如自體相者，一切凡夫、聲聞、緣覺、菩薩、諸佛無有增減，非前際生、非後際滅，畢竟常恒。	復次真如自體相者，一切凡夫、聲聞、緣覺、菩薩、諸佛無有增減，非前際生、非後際滅，畢竟常恒。	Next, as for the intrinsic nature of suchness, all ordinary beings, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas have no increase or decrease. It is not produced in the past and does not cease in the future. It is eternally constant.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c23_17']	從本已來唯性自滿足一切功德，所謂自體有大智慧光明義故，遍照法界義故，真實識知義故，自性清淨心義故，常樂我淨義故，清涼不變自在義故。	從本已來唯性自滿足一切功德，所謂自體有大智慧光明義故，遍照法界義故，真實識知義故，自性清淨心義故，常樂我淨義故，清涼不變自在義故。	From the very beginning, it is replete with all merits by its very nature. That is to say, it has the meaning of great wisdom and light by its very nature, the meaning of universally illuminating the Dharma realm, the meaning of true and real cognition, the meaning of the intrinsically pure mind, the meaning of permanence, bliss, self, and purity, and the meaning of being cool, unchangeable, and sovereign.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c26_6']	具足如是過於恒沙不離不斷不異不思議佛法，乃至滿足無有所少義故，名為如來藏，亦名如來法身。	具足如是過於恒沙不離不斷不異不思議佛法，乃至滿足無有所少義故，名為如來藏，亦名如來法身。	Endowed with such qualities, which are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges, inseparable, uninterrupted, not different, inconceivable buddha-dharmas, and so forth, up to the meaning of being complete and lacking nothing, it is therefore called the tathāgatagarbha, and also called the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c26_9']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c27_17']	上說真如其體平等、離一切相，云何復說體有如是種種功德？	上說真如其體平等、離一切相，云何復說體有如是種種功德？	Above it was said that suchness is in essence equal and apart from all characteristics. How can it be said again that the essence has such various qualities?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c28_2']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c29_9']	雖實有此諸功德義，而無差別之相，等同一味，唯一真如。	雖實有此諸功德義，而無差別之相，等同一味，唯一真如。	Although in reality there are these various meanings of qualities, there are no characteristics of discrimination, all being of the same single taste, which is the one suchness.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0639c29_14']	此義云何？	此義云何？	What does this mean?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a01_9']	以無分別，離分別相，是故無二。	以無分別，離分別相，是故無二。	Because it is without discrimination and apart from the characteristics of discrimination, therefore it is nondual.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a01_18']	復以何義得說差別？	復以何義得說差別？	Moreover, by what meaning can distinctions be spoken of?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a02_8']	以依業識生滅相示。	以依業識生滅相示。	It is shown based on the arising and ceasing of karmic consciousness.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a02_13']	此云何示？	此云何示？	How is this shown?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a04_9']	以一切法本來唯心實無於念，而有妄心不覺起念見諸境界，故說無明。	以一切法本來唯心實無於念，而有妄心不覺起念見諸境界，故說無明。	Because all dharmas are originally only mind, and there are no thoughts, yet there is deluded mind that gives rise to thoughts and sees various objects, therefore it is said to be ignorance.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a05_5']	心性不起，即是大智慧光明義故。	心性不起，即是大智慧光明義故。	The nature of the mind being unarisen is the meaning of the great wisdom-illumination.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a06_11']	若心起見即有不見之相，心性離見即是遍照法界義故。	若心起見即有不見之相，心性離見即是遍照法界義故。	If the mind gives rise to views, then there are aspects of non-seeing. The nature of the mind being apart from views is the meaning of universally illuminating the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a09_2']	若心有動非真識知，無有自性，非常非樂非我非淨，熱惱衰變則不自在，乃至具有過恒沙等妄染之義。	若心有動非真識知，無有自性，非常非樂非我非淨，熱惱衰變則不自在，乃至具有過恒沙等妄染之義。	If the mind has movement, it is not true cognition. It has no intrinsic nature, is not permanent, blissful, self, or pure, and is subject to heat, decline, and change, and thus is not sovereign. It even possesses meanings of false defilement that are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a10_8']	對此義故心性無動，則有過恒沙等諸淨功德相義示現。	對此義故心性無動，則有過恒沙等諸淨功德相義示現。	In contrast to this meaning, the nature of the mind being unmoving then has the meaning of the characteristics of pure qualities that are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges being manifested.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a11_7']	若心有起更見前法可念者，則有所少。	若心有起更見前法可念者，則有所少。	If the mind has arising and further sees the phenomena of the mind that can be contemplated, then there is something lacking.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a12_7']	如是淨法無量功德，即是一心，更無所念。	如是淨法無量功德，即是一心，更無所念。	Such pure dharmas with immeasurable qualities are precisely the one mind, and there is nothing else to be contemplated.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a13_1']	是故滿足名為法身如來之藏。	是故滿足名為法身如來之藏。	Therefore, being complete is called the Dharma body, the Tathāgata's storehouse.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a17_4']	復次真如用者，所謂諸佛如來本在因地，發大慈悲修諸波羅蜜，攝化眾生立大誓願，盡欲度脫等眾生界，亦不限劫數盡於未來，以取一切眾生如己身故，而亦不取眾生相。	復次真如用者，所謂諸佛如來本在因地，發大慈悲修諸波羅蜜，攝化眾生立大誓願，盡欲度脫等眾生界，亦不限劫數盡於未來，以取一切眾生如己身故，而亦不取眾生相。	Next, as for the function of suchness, it refers to the fact that all Buddhas and Tathāgatas, while still on the stage of cause, give rise to great compassion and cultivate the perfections, gathering in and transforming sentient beings, making great vows to completely deliver all realms of sentient beings, not limiting the number of kalpas to the end of the future, taking all sentient beings as their own bodies, and yet also not grasping at the characteristics of sentient beings.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a17_9']	此以何義？	此以何義？	What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a18_14']	謂如實知一切眾生及與己身，真如平等，無別異故。	謂如實知一切眾生及與己身，真如平等，無別異故。	It means that they truly understand that all sentient beings and their own bodies are suchness, equal and without distinction.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a21_10']	以有如是大方便智，除滅無明，見本法身自然而有不思議業種種之用，即與真如等遍一切處，又亦無有用相可得。	以有如是大方便智，除滅無明，見本法身自然而有不思議業種種之用，即與真如等遍一切處，又亦無有用相可得。	Because they have this great skillful means wisdom, they eliminate ignorance and see the fundamentally existent Dharma body, which naturally has various functions that are inconceivable. It is equal to suchness and pervades everywhere, and yet there are also no characteristics of function that can be grasped.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a21_14']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a24_3']	謂諸佛如來唯是法身、智相之身，第一義諦，無有世諦境界、離於施作，但隨眾生見聞得益，故說為用。	謂諸佛如來唯是法身、智相之身，第一義諦，無有世諦境界、離於施作，但隨眾生見聞得益，故說為用。	It is said that all buddhas and tathāgatas are only the Dharma body, the body of wisdom, the ultimate truth, without the realm of conventional truth, and apart from activity. They are said to be used only because sentient beings see and hear them and benefit from them.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a24_10']	此用復有二種。	此用復有二種。	This use is also of two kinds.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a24_15']	云何為二？	云何為二？	What are the two?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640a27_5']	一者依分別事識，凡夫二乘心所見者名為應身，以不知轉識現故，見從外來，取色分齊不能盡知故；	一者依分別事識，凡夫二乘心所見者名為應身，以不知轉識現故，見從外來，取色分齊不能盡知故；	The first is the seen one, which is called the reward body, because they do not know that it appears from the transformation of consciousness, and see it coming from the outside, grasping at its limited form and being unable to fully understand it.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b03_9']	二者依於業識，謂諸菩薩從初發意乃至菩薩究竟地，心所見者名為報身，身有無量色、色有無量相、相有無量好，所住依果亦有無量種種莊嚴，隨所示現即無有邊不可窮盡，離分齊相，隨其所應常能住持不毀不失。	二者依於業識，謂諸菩薩從初發意乃至菩薩究竟地，心所見者名為報身，身有無量色、色有無量相、相有無量好，所住依果亦有無量種種莊嚴，隨所示現即無有邊不可窮盡，離分齊相，隨其所應常能住持不毀不失。	Second, it is based on karmic consciousness. That is, what is seen by the minds of bodhisattvas from their initial resolve up to the ultimate stage of a bodhisattva is called the reward body. The body has innumerable colors, the colors have innumerable characteristics, the characteristics have innumerable excellent qualities, and the abode and fruition also have innumerable kinds of adornments. As it appears, it is boundless and inexhaustible, free from limited characteristics, and is always able to uphold and not be destroyed or lost in accordance with what is appropriate.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b05_11']	如是功德皆因諸波羅蜜等無漏行熏，及不思議熏之所成就，具足無量樂相，故說為報。	如是功德皆因諸波羅蜜等無漏行熏，及不思議熏之所成就，具足無量樂相，故說為報。	Such merits are all accomplished by the perfuming of the pāramitās and other uncontaminated practices, as well as inconceivable perfuming, and are endowed with innumerable characteristics of bliss. Therefore, it is called reward.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b07_7']	又凡夫所見者是其麁色，隨於六道各見不同，種種異類非受樂相，故說為應。	又凡夫所見者是其麁色，隨於六道各見不同，種種異類非受樂相，故說為應。	Moreover, what is seen by ordinary beings is coarse form, which is seen differently in the six destinies, with various dissimilar kinds that do not have the characteristics of experiencing bliss. Therefore, it is called response.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b10_3']	復次初發意菩薩所見者，以深信真如法故，少分而見，知彼色相莊嚴等事，無去無來離於分齊，唯依心現不離真如。	復次初發意菩薩所見者，以深信真如法故，少分而見，知彼色相莊嚴等事，無去無來離於分齊，唯依心現不離真如。	Furthermore, what is seen by a bodhisattva who has first given rise to the intention [for enlightenment] is seen to a small extent through deeply believing in the principle of suchness. Knowing that those matters of form, characteristics, adornments, etc. are without going or coming, and are free from distinctions, they are only manifested based on the mind and are not apart from suchness.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b11_2']	然此菩薩猶自分別，以未入法身位故。	然此菩薩猶自分別，以未入法身位故。	However, this bodhisattva still makes distinctions, because they have not yet entered the stage of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b12_9']	若得淨心，所見微妙其用轉勝，乃至菩薩地盡，見之究竟。	若得淨心，所見微妙其用轉勝，乃至菩薩地盡，見之究竟。	If they attain a pure mind, what they see will be subtle and its function will become increasingly superior, up to the end of the stage of bodhisattva, where they will see it to its ultimate.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b13_15']	若離業識則無見相，以諸佛法身無有彼此色相迭相見故。	若離業識則無見相，以諸佛法身無有彼此色相迭相見故。	If one is apart from the karmic consciousness, then there will be no appearance of form, because the Dharma body of all buddhas is without the mutual seeing of each other's forms and characteristics.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b14_1']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b15_1']	若諸佛法身離於色相者，云何能現色相？	若諸佛法身離於色相者，云何能現色相？	If the Dharma body of all buddhas is apart from form and characteristics, then how can it manifest form and characteristics?
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b15_4']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b17_8']	即此法身是色體故能現於色，所謂從本已來色心不二，以色性即智故色體無形，說名智身；	即此法身是色體故能現於色，所謂從本已來色心不二，以色性即智故色體無形，說名智身；	Because this Dharma body is the essence of form, it is able to manifest form. It is said that from the very beginning, form and mind are non-dual, because the nature of form is wisdom, and therefore the essence of form has no shape, and is called the body of wisdom;
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b18_1']	以智性即色故，說名法身。	以智性即色故，說名法身。	Because the nature of wisdom is precisely form, it is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b19_5']	遍一切處所現之色無有分齊，隨心能示十方世界。	遍一切處所現之色無有分齊，隨心能示十方世界。	The form that appears everywhere has no boundaries, and can manifest in the worlds of the ten directions according to the mind.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0640b21_13']	無量菩薩無量報身、無量莊嚴各各差別，皆無分齊而不相妨，此非心識分別能知，以真如自在用義故。	無量菩薩無量報身、無量莊嚴各各差別，皆無分齊而不相妨，此非心識分別能知，以真如自在用義故。	The immeasurable retribution bodies and immeasurable adornments of immeasurable bodhisattvas each have their own distinctions, all without boundaries and yet not obstructing each other. This cannot be known through the discriminating mind, because it is the meaning of the true suchness of the inherent function.

From the very beginning, it is one by itself, and it makes itself the same. It is tired of being different and abandons distinctions, because there is only one true nature.

These four kinds of faults are used as the counter-measure to establish and reveal the four virtues in the essence of original enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1668_006:0642c04_16']	如本非常非樂非我非淨故。	如本非常非樂非我非淨故。	As the text says, because it is not permanent, not happy, not self, and not pure.
