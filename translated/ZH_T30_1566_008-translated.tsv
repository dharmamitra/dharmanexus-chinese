The characteristics that exist later continue with those characteristics of previous thoughts, and cause and effect are not distinguished.
['ZH_T30_1566_008:0089a05_15']	前有相思，此剎那作名為自作，由前剎那思所積集善不善業，彼業滅時與後為因。	前有相思，此剎那作名為自作，由前剎那思所積集善不善業，彼業滅時與後為因。	008	The thought with characteristics that existed previously is called self-made in this moment. Due to the wholesome or unwholesome karma accumulated by the thought of the previous moment, when that karma ceases, it becomes the cause for what follows.
['ZH_T30_1566_008:0089a07_11']	如彼燈焰前為後因，如是展轉相續乃至得果，故非不作而得，亦非作已失滅。	如彼燈焰前為後因，如是展轉相續乃至得果，故非不作而得，亦非作已失滅。	008	Just as the flame of a lamp becomes the cause for what follows, so it is in this way, continuing in a causal series until the result is obtained.

['ZH_T30_1566_008:0089a14_11']	由先心剎那所傳來業，對治未生、相續與果，以功能勝異故。	由先心剎那所傳來業，對治未生、相續與果，以功能勝異故。	008	Because the karma transmitted by the momentary mind of the past, not yet having arisen as an antidote, continues to produce results, due to the superiority of its function.
['ZH_T30_1566_008:0089a16_2']	譬如以紫鑛汁浸摩多弄伽子種之，後時花中有紫鑛色不違世諦。	譬如以紫鑛汁浸摩多弄伽子種之，後時花中有紫鑛色不違世諦。	008	For example, by soaking a madan flower in lac dye and planting it, later when the flower has the color of lac dye, it does not contradict worldly truth.
