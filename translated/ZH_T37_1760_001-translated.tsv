['ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c17_0', 'ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c18_0']	孤山沙門釋智圓述🔽夫心性之為體也，明乎！靜乎！一而已矣。無凡	孤山沙門釋智圓述 夫心性之為體也，明乎！靜乎！一而已矣。無凡	001	Expounded by the Monk Shi Zhizhuan of Gushan
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c21_6']	聖焉、無依正焉、無延促焉、無淨穢焉，及其感物而動、隨緣而變，則為六凡焉、為三聖焉，有依焉、有正焉。	聖焉、無依正焉、無延促焉、無淨穢焉，及其感物而動、隨緣而變，則為六凡焉、為三聖焉，有依焉、有正焉。	001	As for the essence of the mind, it is clear, still, and one. There are no ordinary beings or sages, no dependent or correct, no long or short, no pure or defiled. When it responds to things and moves, following conditions and changing, it becomes the six realms of beings or the three sages, with dependence or correctness.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c22_5']	依正既作，則身壽有延促矣，國土有淨穢矣！	依正既作，則身壽有延促矣，國土有淨穢矣！	001	Once dependence and correctness are established, then lifespan has long and short, and the lands have pure and defiled.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c26_9']	吾佛大聖人，得明靜之一者也，乃假道於慈、託宿於悲，將欲驅群迷使復其本，於是乎無身而示身、無土而示土，延其壽、淨其土，俾其欣促其壽、穢其土俾其厭，既欣且厭則漸誘之策行矣。	吾佛大聖人，得明靜之一者也，乃假道於慈、託宿於悲，將欲驅群迷使復其本，於是乎無身而示身、無土而示土，延其壽、淨其土，俾其欣促其壽、穢其土俾其厭，既欣且厭則漸誘之策行矣。	001	Our great sage Buddha attained clarity and stillness, and then borrowed the Way from kindness and relied on the past in compassion. He wanted to drive away the deluded masses and make them return to their origins. Therefore, he manifested a body where there was none, and lands where there were none. He extended their lifespans and purified their lands, making them delighted. He shortened their lifespans and defiled their lands, making them disgusted. Once they were delighted and disgusted, then the strategy of gradual guidance could be implemented.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c27_9']	是故釋迦現有量而取穢土，非欲其厭耶！	是故釋迦現有量而取穢土，非欲其厭耶！	001	Therefore, Śākyamuni, while having a limited lifespan, chose a defiled land, not wishing to disgust [sentient beings],
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c28_5']	彌陀現無量而取淨土，非欲其欣乎！	彌陀現無量而取淨土，非欲其欣乎！	001	while Amitâbha, while having an immeasurable lifespan, chose a pure land, not wishing to delight [sentient beings].
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0350c29_11']	此則折之、彼則攝之，使其復本而達性耳，故《淨名》曰：	此則折之、彼則攝之，使其復本而達性耳，故《淨名》曰：	001	This is to restrain [the defiled] and that is to attract [the pure], causing them to return to the origin and reach the nature. Therefore, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says:
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a01_7']	隨所調伏眾生而取佛土者，其是謂乎！	隨所調伏眾生而取佛土者，其是謂乎！	001	Those who choose a buddha land according to the sentient beings to be tamed, this is it!
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a02_14']	雖寶樓金地無悅目之翫，而非惑蕩之色，而能達唯心無境矣。	雖寶樓金地無悅目之翫，而非惑蕩之色，而能達唯心無境矣。	001	Although there are no delightful sights such as jeweled towers and golden grounds, they are not distracting colors, but rather one can realize that only the mind exists without objects.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a04_3']	雖風樹鳥聲有入耳之娛，而非惉懘之音，而能念三寶有歸矣。	雖風樹鳥聲有入耳之娛，而非惉懘之音，而能念三寶有歸矣。	001	Although there are sounds of wind, trees, and birds that bring pleasure to the ears, they are not frivolous sounds, but rather one can contemplate the three jewels and have a place to return to.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a05_1']	夫如是則復乎明靜之體者如轉掌耳。	夫如是則復乎明靜之體者如轉掌耳。	001	If it is like this, then returning to the body of clear stillness is as easy as turning the palm.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a05_4']	經云：	經云：	001	The sūtra says:
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a05_18']	眾生生者，皆是阿鞞跋致是也。	眾生生者，皆是阿鞞跋致是也。	001	The sentient beings born there are all irreversible from the attainment of buddhahood.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a06_1']	大矣哉！	大矣哉！	001	How great indeed!
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a06_10']	聖人之善權也如此。	聖人之善權也如此。	001	The skillful means of the sages are like this.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a07_7']	是故群經森列而偏讚淨方，其有旨哉！	是故群經森列而偏讚淨方，其有旨哉！	001	Therefore, the scriptures are numerous, yet they all praise the Pure Land. What is the reason for this?
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a08_2']	佛說阿彌陀經者，其偏讚之謂歟。	佛說阿彌陀經者，其偏讚之謂歟。	001	The Buddha Speaks the Sutra of Amitāyus is perhaps the most prominent among them.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a09_9']	吾愛其辭簡而理明、其文約而事備，足可以誘弱喪而擊童蒙焉。	吾愛其辭簡而理明、其文約而事備，足可以誘弱喪而擊童蒙焉。	001	I love its concise language and clear principles, its concise text and complete content, which are sufficient to guide the ignorant and inspire the young.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a11_18']	於是約龍樹之宗、準智者之說，依經辨理為之義疏，若極深研幾則吾豈敢，庶乎有助於真風、為益於後昆爾。	於是約龍樹之宗、準智者之說，依經辨理為之義疏，若極深研幾則吾豈敢，庶乎有助於真風、為益於後昆爾。	001	Therefore, I have summarized the teachings of Nāgârjuna, followed the explanations of Zhizhe, and based on the sutra, I have distinguished the principles and written a commentary on its meaning. If I were to investigate the most profound aspects, how dare I? I merely hope to contribute to the true Dharma wind and benefit later generations.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a12_6']	釋題玄義五重：	釋題玄義五重：	001	The explanation of the title has five profound meanings:
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a12_14']	二土，果人名也；	二土，果人名也；	001	The two lands are the names of the fruition people;

['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a13_18']	捨苦得樂，用也；	捨苦得樂，用也；	001	Abandoning suffering and attaining happiness is the function;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a14_4']	生蘇，大乘教也。	生蘇，大乘教也。	001	The mature milk is the Mahayana teaching.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a15_4']	夫名以詮體，會體由宗，宗成有用，四義成列。	夫名以詮體，會體由宗，宗成有用，四義成列。	001	The name is used to expound the essence, the essence is understood through the essence, the essence is accomplished through the function, and the four meanings are established.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a15_18']	大小未辨，故須教相區以別之。	大小未辨，故須教相區以別之。	001	Since the size [of the sutra] has yet to be determined, it is necessary to teach the distinctions in order to differentiate them.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a16_19']	初六字之名有通有別，經字通名，大小同號故；	初六字之名有通有別，經字通名，大小同號故；	001	The first six characters have both general and specific names. The character sutra is the general name, as it is called the same for both large and small [sutras];
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a17_10']	上五別名，此說異彼故。	上五別名，此說異彼故。	001	The next five are specific names, as this explanation differs from that [of the large sutra].
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a18_12']	於別名中，佛是果人之通名，彌陀是果人之別號。	於別名中，佛是果人之通名，彌陀是果人之別號。	001	Among the specific names, Buddha is the general name for the fruition person, while Amitabha is the specific title for the fruition person.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a19_13']	釋迦既此方化主，庶物咸知，故隱別而彰通；	釋迦既此方化主，庶物咸知，故隱別而彰通；	001	Since Shakyamuni is the teacher of this land, all beings are familiar with him, so the specific [title] is hidden and the general [name] is shown;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a20_13']	彌陀是彼土世尊，理須標簡，故略通而存別。	彌陀是彼土世尊，理須標簡，故略通而存別。	001	Amitabha is the World-Honored One of that land, and the principle requires distinguishing him, so the general [name] is omitted and the specific [title] is retained.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a21_2']	通別互現，其義惟明。	通別互現，其義惟明。	001	The general and specific names appear alternately, and the meaning is only clear.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a21_13']	若統而括之，凡有三對：	若統而括之，凡有三對：	001	If they are summarized, there are generally three pairs:
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a22_11']	經即能詮之教，上乃所詮之義，教義對也；	經即能詮之教，上乃所詮之義，教義對也；	001	Sutra refers to the teaching that can be expounded, while above refers to the meaning that is expounded. This is the pair of teaching and meaning;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a23_14']	阿彌陀標彼土世尊，佛說指此方化主，彼此對也；	阿彌陀標彼土世尊，佛說指此方化主，彼此對也；	001	Amitabha refers to the World-Honored One of that land, while spoken by the Buddha refers to the teacher of this land. This is the pair of this and that;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a24_14']	說者誠實口業，佛者黃金之色身，身口對也。	說者誠實口業，佛者黃金之色身，身口對也。	001	The speaker is sincere, the mouth karma is true, the Buddha has a golden-colored body, the body and mouth correspond.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a25_2']	寬之狹三對在焉。	寬之狹三對在焉。	001	The three pairs of wide and narrow are contained therein.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a26_12']	佛者極果之美號也，果必由因克，始悟名因，悟必從迷，不迷何悟？	佛者極果之美號也，果必由因克，始悟名因，悟必從迷，不迷何悟？	001	The Buddha is the beautiful title of the ultimate fruit, the fruit must be accomplished by the cause, the beginning enlightenment is called the cause, the enlightenment must come from delusion, without delusion, what enlightenment?
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a27_1']	迷非本是，悟復何從？	迷非本是，悟復何從？	001	Delusion is not originally so, where does enlightenment come from?
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a27_12']	欲㼼明斯旨，當曉六即：	欲㼼明斯旨，當曉六即：	001	If you want to clarify this meaning, you should understand the six identities:
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a27_18']	一、理即佛；	一、理即佛；	001	1. The identity of principle;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a28_3']	二、名字即佛；	二、名字即佛；	001	2. The identity of names and words;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a28_10']	三、觀行即佛；	三、觀行即佛；	001	3. The identity of contemplation and practice;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a28_17']	四、相似即佛；	四、相似即佛；	001	4. The identity of similarity;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a29_1']	五、分真即佛；	五、分真即佛；	001	5. The identity of partial truth;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351a29_8']	六、究竟即佛。	六、究竟即佛。	001	6. The identity of ultimate truth.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b01_1']	凡聖不濫故六，初後皆是故即。	凡聖不濫故六，初後皆是故即。	001	Because there is no confusion between ordinary beings and sages, there are six. Because the beginning and end are all the same, there is identity.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b03_8']	理即佛者，一念心即如來藏理，如故即空，藏故即假，理故即中，三智一心本來具足非適今也，名理即佛。	理即佛者，一念心即如來藏理，如故即空，藏故即假，理故即中，三智一心本來具足非適今也，名理即佛。	001	The identity of principle means that a single thought is the principle of the Tathāgatagarbha. Because it is suchness, it is empty. Because it is a storehouse, it is provisional. Because it is principle, it is the middle. The three knowledges are originally complete in one mind, not just now. It is called the identity of principle and Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b07_2']	名字即佛者，理雖即是，自用不知，以未聞三諦、不識佛法，如牛羊眼不識方隅，或從知識或從經卷聞如上說，於名字中通達解了，知一切法皆是佛法，名名字即佛。	名字即佛者，理雖即是，自用不知，以未聞三諦、不識佛法，如牛羊眼不識方隅，或從知識或從經卷聞如上說，於名字中通達解了，知一切法皆是佛法，名名字即佛。	001	Name is Buddha means that although principle is indeed Buddha, one's own use is not yet known. Without hearing the three truths and not recognizing the Buddha Dharma, one is like a cow or sheep whose eyes do not recognize directions. Either from a teacher or from a sutra, one hears the above explanations and penetrates and understands in the names, knowing that all dharmas are Buddha Dharma. This is called name is Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b09_3']	觀行即佛者，若但聞名口說，如虫食木偶得成字，是虫不知是字非字，既不通達，寧是菩提？	觀行即佛者，若但聞名口說，如虫食木偶得成字，是虫不知是字非字，既不通達，寧是菩提？	001	Contemplation practice is Buddha means that if one only hears the name and speaks with the mouth, it is like an insect eating wood accidentally forming a character. The insect does not know if it is a character or not. Since one does not penetrate, how can it be bodhi?
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b10_18']	必須心觀明了、理慧相應，所行如所言、所言如所行，言行相應，名觀行即佛。	必須心觀明了、理慧相應，所行如所言、所言如所行，言行相應，名觀行即佛。	001	It is necessary for the mind's contemplation to be clear and for principle and wisdom to correspond. One's practice should be as one's words, and one's words should be as one's practice. The correspondence of words and actions is called contemplation practice is Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b13_5']	相似即佛者，愈觀愈明、愈止愈寂，麁垢自落，六根互□□□□證如鍮似金貴實珠形色相似，名相似即佛。	相似即佛者，愈觀愈明、愈止愈寂，麁垢自落，六根互□□□□證如鍮似金貴實珠形色相似，名相似即佛。	001	Similarity is Buddha means that the more one contemplates, the clearer it becomes, and the more one stops, the more tranquil it becomes. Coarse defilements naturally fall away. The six sense faculties interpenetrate and testify to the truth. It is like brass resembling gold in value and a pearl's shape and color being similar. This is called similarity is Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b16_11']	分真即佛者，因相似觀入初住位，破無明見佛性，開祕藏顯真如，始發心終等覺，或普門示現於九界利生，或八相成道以佛身度物，名分真即佛。	分真即佛者，因相似觀入初住位，破無明見佛性，開祕藏顯真如，始發心終等覺，或普門示現於九界利生，或八相成道以佛身度物，名分真即佛。	001	The Buddhahood of distinction means that based on the similar contemplation, one enters the stage of initial abiding, breaks through ignorance, sees the Buddha-nature, opens the secret treasury, reveals true suchness, begins the stage of initial resolve and ends at the stage of equivalent enlightenment, or universally manifests in the nine realms to benefit beings, or achieves Buddhahood through the eight stages of practice and liberates beings with the Buddha's body. This is called the Buddhahood of distinction.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b19_1']	究竟即佛者，從等覺心轉入妙覺，智光圓滿不可復增，惑闇滅盡更無可斷，唯佛與佛乃能知之，名究竟即佛。	究竟即佛者，從等覺心轉入妙覺，智光圓滿不可復增，惑闇滅盡更無可斷，唯佛與佛乃能知之，名究竟即佛。	001	The Buddhahood of consummation means that from the mind of equivalent enlightenment, one turns and enters the wondrous enlightenment, the light of wisdom is perfectly full and cannot be increased further, the darkness of delusion is completely extinguished and there is no more to be eliminated. Only the Buddhas and Buddhas can know it. This is called the Buddhahood of consummation.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b21_12']	譬若貧人家有寶而無知者，知識示之而後知，於是耘除草穢而掘出之，漸漸得近，近已藏開，盡取用之獲大富樂。	譬若貧人家有寶而無知者，知識示之而後知，於是耘除草穢而掘出之，漸漸得近，近已藏開，盡取用之獲大富樂。	001	It is like a poor family that has a treasure but no one knows about it. A knowledgeable person shows it to them and only then do they know. They then clear away the weeds and dig it out, gradually getting closer to it. Having gotten close, they open the treasure and take it all to use, obtaining great wealth and happiness.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b22_2']	以喻六即，其旨可見。	以喻六即，其旨可見。	001	Using this as a metaphor for the six identities, the meaning can be seen.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b25_12']	今言佛者，即釋迦化主，乃究竟人也，如此解者，豈但識果地之崇高必由因克，抑亦達自心之微妙本有果性，是則始凡理具趣取無怯，終聖在佛上慢不生。	今言佛者，即釋迦化主，乃究竟人也，如此解者，豈但識果地之崇高必由因克，抑亦達自心之微妙本有果性，是則始凡理具趣取無怯，終聖在佛上慢不生。	001	Now, when it says Buddha, it refers to Shakyamuni, the teacher of transformation, who is the ultimate person. Understanding it like this, not only does one know that the lofty fruit of Buddhahood must be attained through causes, but one also realizes that the subtle nature of Buddhahood originally exists in one's own mind. Thus, from the beginning as an ordinary person, one is fully endowed with the principle and takes it up without fear. In the end, even as a Buddha, one does not give rise to arrogance.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b26_4']	說者悅也，得機而說稱悅。	說者悅也，得機而說稱悅。	001	To speak means to delight. Speaking in accordance with the capacities of beings is called delight.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b28_16']	佛懷此經即得彼物機，與彌陀有緣者乃讚彼依正令發願往生，既生彼國則不退轉而終趣菩提稱悅，佛其在此矣。	佛懷此經即得彼物機，與彌陀有緣者乃讚彼依正令發願往生，既生彼國則不退轉而終趣菩提稱悅，佛其在此矣。	001	The Buddha cherishes this sutra and finds the capacities of beings who can receive it. Those who have a connection with Amitabha are praised for their pure land and encouraged to give rise to the aspiration to be born there. Once born in that land, they will not regress and will eventually reach enlightenment, which is called delighting the Buddha. This is what it means.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351b29_21']	阿彌陀，梵語也，茲言無量，阿之言無，彌陀言量也。	阿彌陀，梵語也，茲言無量，阿之言無，彌陀言量也。	001	Amitabha is a Sanskrit word, which means infinite. A means no and mitabha means measure.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c01_6']	何故名無量耶？	何故名無量耶？	001	Why is it called infinite?
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c01_13']	以四義故得名：	以四義故得名：	001	It is named so for four reasons:
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c02_2']	一、光明照耀無量；	一、光明照耀無量；	001	First, its radiance shines infinitely;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c02_11']	二、壽命數限無量；	二、壽命數限無量；	001	Second, its lifespan is infinitely long;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c02_20']	三、大小弟子無量；	三、大小弟子無量；	001	Third, the disciples, both great and small, are immeasurable;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c03_16']	四、一生補處無量，由茲四事以無立尊號。	四、一生補處無量，由茲四事以無立尊號。	001	Fourth, the bodhisattvas who are one life away from Buddhahood are immeasurable. For these four reasons, he is called the Honored One of Immeasurable Life.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c05_2']	諸經翻為無量壽佛者，乃下之一義耳，四義悉在經文。	諸經翻為無量壽佛者，乃下之一義耳，四義悉在經文。	001	Those who translate the sutras as Buddha of Immeasurable Life only understand one of the meanings below, while all four meanings are in the sutra text.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c05_20']	夫諸佛皆有生、法二身，則有兩種無量：	夫諸佛皆有生、法二身，則有兩種無量：	001	All Buddhas have both the born body and the Dharma body, so there are two kinds of immeasurability:
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c06_14']	一、生身無量，此則有量之無量；	一、生身無量，此則有量之無量；	001	First, the born body is immeasurable, which is the measurability within immeasurability;
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c07_7']	二、法身無量，此是無量之無量。	二、法身無量，此是無量之無量。	001	Second, the Dharma body is immeasurable, which is the immeasurability within immeasurability.
['ZH_T37_1760_001:0351c11_11']	法身譬虛空無生無滅，生身如水月有隱有顯，故釋迦、彌陀俱得法身之無量，但此土機劣故見生身是有量，彼土根勝故見生身是無量，但以人天莫數故言無量、若望法身定屬有量。	法身譬虛空無生無滅，生身如水月有隱有顯，故釋迦、彌陀俱得法身之無量，但此土機劣故見生身是有量，彼土根勝故見生身是無量，但以人天莫數故言無量、若望法身定屬有量。	001	The Dharma body is likened to empty space, without birth or death. The born body is like the moon in water, with concealment and manifestation. Therefore, Shakyamuni and Amitabha both attain the immeasurability of the Dharma body, but because the capacities of beings in this land are inferior, they see the born body as having measure.
