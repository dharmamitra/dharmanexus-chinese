['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a13_18']	今於此中應作是說。	今於此中應作是說。	002	Here, it should be said:
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a14_3']	色有二種：	色有二種：	002	Form is of two kinds:
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a15_11']	一顯、二形，顯色謂青黃等，形色謂長短等，而不說者有何意耶？	一顯、二形，顯色謂青黃等，形色謂長短等，而不說者有何意耶？	002	The first is visible form, and the second is shape. Visible form refers to blue, yellow, and so on. Shape refers to long, short, and so on. What is the meaning of not mentioning them?
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a16_1']	謂顯色麁及易知故。	謂顯色麁及易知故。	002	It is because visible form is gross and easy to know.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a16_19']	如是諸色於六識中二識所識，謂眼及意。	如是諸色於六識中二識所識，謂眼及意。	002	These various forms are cognized by two consciousnesses among the six consciousnesses, namely the eye consciousness and the mental consciousness.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a19_17']	先用眼識唯了自相，後用意識了自共相，謂彼諸色住現在時，眼識唯能了彼自相，眼識無間起分別意識，重了前色自相或共相。	先用眼識唯了自相，後用意識了自共相，謂彼諸色住現在時，眼識唯能了彼自相，眼識無間起分別意識，重了前色自相或共相。	002	First, using the eye consciousness, one only cognizes its specific characteristics. Later, using the mental consciousness, one cognizes its general and specific characteristics. When those forms abide in the present, the eye consciousness can only cognize their specific characteristics. Immediately after the eye consciousness, the discriminating mental consciousness arises and repeatedly cognizes the previous form's specific or general characteristics.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a21_15']	然此所起分別意識，依前眼識緣前色境，如是意識正現在時，所依所緣並在過去。	然此所起分別意識，依前眼識緣前色境，如是意識正現在時，所依所緣並在過去。	002	However, this mental consciousness that arises depends on the previous eye consciousness and takes the previous form as its object. When this mental consciousness is present, its support and object are both in the past.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a24_3']	由斯五境住現在時，意識不能了彼自相，是故色境二識所識，謂諸眼識現在前時，唯了現在自相非共。	由斯五境住現在時，意識不能了彼自相，是故色境二識所識，謂諸眼識現在前時，唯了現在自相非共。	002	For this reason, when the five objects abide in the present, the mental consciousness cannot cognize their specific characteristics. Therefore, form objects are cognized by two consciousnesses, namely the various eye consciousnesses. When they are present, they only cognize the present specific characteristics, not the general characteristics.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a25_16']	若諸意識現在前時，通了三世自相共相，以諸意識境界遍故、有分別故。	若諸意識現在前時，通了三世自相共相，以諸意識境界遍故、有分別故。	002	When mental consciousness is present, it cognizes the specific and general characteristics of the three times, because the objects of mental consciousness are all-pervasive and have discrimination.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a26_16']	眼識無間非定起意識，於六識身容隨起一種。	眼識無間非定起意識，於六識身容隨起一種。	002	When eye consciousness is immediately followed by mental consciousness, it is possible for any one of the six consciousnesses to arise.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a28_10']	若眼識無間定起意識者，則苦根不應為苦等無間，苦根唯在五識身故。	若眼識無間定起意識者，則苦根不應為苦等無間，苦根唯在五識身故。	002	If mental consciousness definitely arises immediately after eye consciousness, then the faculty of suffering should not be the homogeneous and immediately antecedent condition for suffering, because the faculty of suffering is only in the group of five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992a28_20']	若爾，便違根蘊所說。	若爾，便違根蘊所說。	002	If that is so, then it contradicts what is said in the Treatise on the Aggregates.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992b01_18']	如說苦根與苦根為因、等無間增上，然依眼識了別色已，無間引起分別意識，故作是言。	如說苦根與苦根為因、等無間增上，然依眼識了別色已，無間引起分別意識，故作是言。	002	It says: The faculty of suffering is a cause, homogeneous and immediately antecedent condition, and dominant condition for the faculty of suffering. However, it is said that after the eye consciousness cognizes form, it immediately gives rise to discriminating mental consciousness.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992b02_13']	眼識先識，眼識受已，意識隨識。	眼識先識，眼識受已，意識隨識。	002	Therefore it says: Eye consciousness first cognizes, eye consciousness receives, and mental consciousness cognizes accordingly.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992b04_3']	聲有二種，乃至廣說，有執受大種者，謂諸大種現在剎那有情數攝。	聲有二種，乃至廣說，有執受大種者，謂諸大種現在剎那有情數攝。	002	Sound is of two kinds, and so on, at length. That which is derived from the great elements that are appropriated refers to the great elements of the present moment that are included in sentient beings.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992b05_13']	無執受大種者，謂諸大種過去未來有情數攝，及三世非有情數攝。	無執受大種者，謂諸大種過去未來有情數攝，及三世非有情數攝。	002	The great elements that are not grasped are the great elements of the past and future that are included in sentient beings, and those of the three times that are not included in sentient beings.

['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992b08_7']	無執受大種為因聲亦爾。	無執受大種為因聲亦爾。	002	The sound with ungrasped great elements as its cause is also like this.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992b09_6']	若從口出手等合生，名有執受大種因聲。	若從口出手等合生，名有執受大種因聲。	002	If it arises from the combination of the mouth, hands, etc., it is called the sound with grasped great elements as its cause.
['ZH_T28_1555_002:0992b10_5']	若從林水風等所生，名無執受大種因聲。	若從林水風等所生，名無執受大種因聲。	002	If it arises from forests, water, wind, etc., it is called the sound with ungrasped great elements as its cause.

Those that are pleasing are called flavors that can be enjoyed, those that are displeasing are called flavors that cannot be enjoyed, and those that are contrary to both are called flavors that lead to equanimity.

If salty, sour, and so on increase, then tongue consciousness arises first. If touch and taste are equal, tongue consciousness also arises first, because the desire for taste is superior.
