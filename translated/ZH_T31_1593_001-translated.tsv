['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a19_15']	一能與彼生次第緣依故，先滅識為意；	一能與彼生次第緣依故，先滅識為意；	001	First, it can serve as the immediately antecedent condition for the arising of those [consciousnesses], so the ceased consciousness becomes thought;
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a20_5']	又以識生依止為意。	又以識生依止為意。	001	And it is also thought because it is the basis for the arising of consciousness.

['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a23_12']	此煩惱識由一依止生，由第二染污，由緣塵及次第能分別故。	此煩惱識由一依止生，由第二染污，由緣塵及次第能分別故。	001	This defiled consciousness is born from one support, and is defiled by a second, because it is able to discriminate objects and their order.
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a23_17']	此二名意。	此二名意。	001	These two are called manas.
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a24_6']	云何得知有染污心？	云何得知有染污心？	001	How do we know that there is a defiled mind?
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a25_12']	若無此心，獨行無明則不可說有，與五識相似此法應無。	若無此心，獨行無明則不可說有，與五識相似此法應無。	001	If this mind did not exist, the independent ignorance would not be able to exist, and this dharma would not exist, similar to the five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a25_16']	何以故？	何以故？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a26_13']	此五識共一時有自依止，謂眼等諸根。	此五識共一時有自依止，謂眼等諸根。	001	These five consciousnesses have their own supports, namely the eyes and so on, which exist simultaneously with them.
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a27_3']	復次意名應無有義。	復次意名應無有義。	001	Moreover, the name manas would be meaningless.
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114a27_17']	復次無想定、滅心定應無有異。	復次無想定、滅心定應無有異。	001	Moreover, the two attainments, the attainment of non-perception and the attainment of cessation, would not be different.

If there were no view of self, pride of self, and so on,
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114b04_16']	復次一切時中起我執遍善、惡、無記心中，若不如此，但惡心與我執等相應故，我及我所此或得行，於善、無記中則不得行。	復次一切時中起我執遍善、惡、無記心中，若不如此，但惡心與我執等相應故，我及我所此或得行，於善、無記中則不得行。	001	Furthermore, the grasping of a self occurs at all times, in good, bad, and indeterminate minds. If this were not so, then since only a bad mind would be associated with the grasping of a self, the activity of self and what belongs to the self would occur in good and indeterminate minds.
['ZH_T31_1593_001:0114b05_9']	若立二心同時生，無此過失；	若立二心同時生，無此過失；	001	If it is established that two minds arise simultaneously, there is no fault.
