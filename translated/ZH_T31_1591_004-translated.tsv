['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c12_20']	識從自種生者，以因性同故，非有質礙。	識從自種生者，以因性同故，非有質礙。	The consciousness arises from its own seeds because the nature of the cause is the same, and it is not obstructed.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c13_17']	所依所緣五識身境識之相故，猶如意識。	所依所緣五識身境識之相故，猶如意識。	The basis and objects of the five consciousnesses are the characteristics of the consciousness of the objects, just like mental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c15_9']	或不離心心所體性，彼眼等識同共作業能生因故，猶如意處法處。	或不離心心所體性，彼眼等識同共作業能生因故，猶如意處法處。	Or, it is not separate from the nature of the mind and mental factors, because those eye consciousnesses and so forth have the same function of producing the cause, just like the dharma realm in the mind.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c16_8']	此說表示蘇呾羅意，經但說意，不立宗故。	此說表示蘇呾羅意，經但說意，不立宗故。	This explains the meaning of the sūtra, which only speaks of the mind and does not establish a thesis.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c17_6']	彼所破者，亦不成立斯之所立唯少分義。	彼所破者，亦不成立斯之所立唯少分義。	What they refute also does not establish this slightly different meaning.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c18_1']	若立此義，不應更說廣造眾論。	若立此義，不應更說廣造眾論。	If this meaning is established, one should not speak of extensively creating various treatises again.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c18_6']	此云何知？	此云何知？	How can this be known?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c19_14']	猶密意等說成立果及以境界，入人無性說十二處亦復如是。	猶密意等說成立果及以境界，入人無性說十二處亦復如是。	It is just like the meaning of the intention to establish the result and the realm, and entering the non-nature of persons, speaking of the twelve sense bases is also like this.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c20_13']	若離眼等色自性已，即能趣入人無我性。	若離眼等色自性已，即能趣入人無我性。	If one departs from the self-nature of form and the eye, one can then enter into the nature of the non-existence of a person.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c20_17']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c22_1']	此從二六內外差別，謂即眼等色等六境如是轉生。	此從二六內外差別，謂即眼等色等六境如是轉生。	This arises from the internal and external distinctions of the two sixes, namely, the eye and so forth, and the six objects such as form, and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c23_13']	亦不從彼差別見者，乃至眼觸眼等作用，離此自性，不應別更有其作者。	亦不從彼差別見者，乃至眼觸眼等作用，離此自性，不應別更有其作者。	It also does not arise from the distinctions of the seer and so forth, up to the function of the eye such as the eye contact and so forth. Apart from this self-nature, there should not be any other agent.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c24_17']	若依眼等而作事業，自在受用，斯說為我我執所縛。	若依眼等而作事業，自在受用，斯說為我我執所縛。	If one relies on the eye and so forth to perform activities, and freely enjoys them, this is said to be the self bound by the grasping of self.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c26_1']	今於此中唯內外處和合自在，眼等作用有生滅故。	今於此中唯內外處和合自在，眼等作用有生滅故。	In this case, it is only the internal and external bases that freely combine, and the functions of the eye and so forth arise and cease.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c26_15']	斯亦非我眼等為因，無觸對故。	斯亦非我眼等為因，無觸對故。	This is also not the self, because the eye and so forth are not in contact with it.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c27_9']	常與有情不相捨離，但說為因。	常與有情不相捨離，但說為因。	It is always inseparable from sentient beings, and is only said to be the cause.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0089c29_2']	然能作者，於眼等處義亦如前，是故從彼別類不生，由是能悟人無性理。	然能作者，於眼等處義亦如前，是故從彼別類不生，由是能悟人無性理。	However, the agent in the eye and so forth is also as explained before. Therefore, it does not arise from a separate category. By this, one can understand the principle of the non-existence of the nature of a person.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a01_1']	若人無性能調伏者，趣寂之人此亦能入。	若人無性能調伏者，趣寂之人此亦能入。	If a person is able to subdue without self-nature, then one who seeks tranquility can also enter this.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a01_5']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a02_16']	由於生死見眾苦逼，以苦無常，於生死中心生厭離，無我見力頓能棄捨。	由於生死見眾苦逼，以苦無常，於生死中心生厭離，無我見力頓能棄捨。	Because in birth and death one sees the oppression of various sufferings, and because of the impermanence of suffering, one's mind gives rise to disgust in birth and death, and the power of the view of no-self can suddenly abandon [birth and death].
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a03_17']	怖我斷者，次第因盡故，猶如薪盡火即滅故。	怖我斷者，次第因盡故，猶如薪盡火即滅故。	One who fears the cessation of self gradually causes the causes to be exhausted, just as when firewood is exhausted the fire is extinguished.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a04_2']	是故佛言：	是故佛言：	Therefore the Buddha said:
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a04_11']	為斯等類說十二處。	為斯等類說十二處。	For these kinds of people, he spoke of the twelve sense bases.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a05_7']	有說是中不為人無性理說十二處。	有說是中不為人無性理說十二處。	Some say that within this, he did not speak of the twelve sense bases for those without the principle of self-nature.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a06_15']	此之二相等無差別，有物性故我見顛倒，以對治故此說如理。	此之二相等無差別，有物性故我見顛倒，以對治故此說如理。	These two characteristics are equally without distinction, because of the existence of self-nature. The view of self is inverted, and because of the antidote, this is said to be reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a07_14']	如以顛倒對治顛倒，此非所許亦不善了。	如以顛倒對治顛倒，此非所許亦不善了。	Just as with the inversion of the antidote to inversion, this is not accepted and is also not well understood.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a08_9']	我之所立此之處等，寧無差別？	我之所立此之處等，寧無差別？	How can the distinctions of these sense bases and so forth that I establish be nonexistent?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a08_19']	心及心所，體相差別。	心及心所，體相差別。	The essence and characteristics of the mind and mental factors are distinct.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a10_6']	若此志樂心心所時，然彼眼處非耳等處，由是此說相差別故。	若此志樂心心所時，然彼眼處非耳等處，由是此說相差別故。	When this aspiration and mind and mental factors occur, the eye faculty is not the ear faculty, etc., because this is said to be the difference in characteristics.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a11_10']	此亦如是，同時非一識生於彼，是眼等處自性樂欲。	此亦如是，同時非一識生於彼，是眼等處自性樂欲。	It is the same here. At the same time, not one consciousness arises in them, which is the self-nature aspiration of the eye faculties, etc.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a12_9']	然而色等住金性時，非銀等性，相無差別。	然而色等住金性時，非銀等性，相無差別。	However, when form, etc. abides in the nature of gold, it is not the nature of silver, etc., and the characteristics are undifferentiated.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a13_7']	此之金等離色等已，不能異說有其別物。	此之金等離色等已，不能異說有其別物。	This gold, etc., apart from form, etc., cannot be said to have a separate substance.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a14_6']	如是道理，此無差別，不於體性說有色等。	如是道理，此無差別，不於體性說有色等。	This principle is the same here. Without differentiation, form, etc. are said to exist in substance.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a15_10']	若如所說相顛倒故不能對治，此與前執有情性同。	若如所說相顛倒故不能對治，此與前執有情性同。	If, as stated, due to the inversion of characteristics, it cannot be a remedy, this is the same as the previous attachment to the nature of sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a16_13']	如彼有情於無我處而見我者是顛倒性，斯見顛倒。	如彼有情於無我處而見我者是顛倒性，斯見顛倒。	Just as those sentient beings, in the absence of self, see self, this is the nature of inversion, and this view is inverted.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a17_8']	此能除遣如色等處，除我倒故。	此能除遣如色等處，除我倒故。	This is able to eliminate, just as form, etc., eliminate the inversion of self, therefore.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a18_4']	若心相續不斷無顛倒者，此亦非理。	若心相續不斷無顛倒者，此亦非理。	If the continuity of mind is uninterrupted and without inversion, this is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a19_7']	是中自性樂欲相似不顛倒者，斯亦不善了前後故。	是中自性樂欲相似不顛倒者，斯亦不善了前後故。	The similarity of the intrinsic nature and desire for non-erroneousness in this case is also not well understood due to the sequence.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a19_12']	若有說云：	若有說云：	If someone says:
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a20_18']	方便悟入人無自性，說色等處有其體性，猶如意處法處。	方便悟入人無自性，說色等處有其體性，猶如意處法處。	The skillful entry into the selflessness of persons is explained, and the existence of the intrinsic nature of form and so forth is explained, just like the mental realm and the dharma realm.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a21_16']	若心心所我之自性彼愛樂者，便無諍論。	若心心所我之自性彼愛樂者，便無諍論。	If one delights in the intrinsic nature of mind and mental factors as the self, then there will be no dispute.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a22_12']	若離心心所別有我體，實無有喻。	若離心心所別有我體，實無有喻。	If there is a self apart from mind and mental factors, there is no analogy at all.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a23_12']	此之言論如所分別，總相類故，非第一義。	此之言論如所分別，總相類故，非第一義。	This discourse is like the general class of distinctions, not the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a24_6']	若說方便趣我無性，是亦不然。	若說方便趣我無性，是亦不然。	If it is said that the skillful approach to the selflessness of intrinsic nature is also not so.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a25_4']	如應觀察安立此之巧妙方便，說色等處。	如應觀察安立此之巧妙方便，說色等處。	One should observe and establish this skillful approach, explaining form and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a26_16']	然佛所說但有如斯所應作事，謂欲令入我無自性，何煩更別說唯有心？	然佛所說但有如斯所應作事，謂欲令入我無自性，何煩更別說唯有心？	However, the Buddha's teachings only have such tasks to be done, namely, wanting to make one enter the selflessness of intrinsic nature. Why bother to further explain that there is only mind?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090a27_15']	此既非有，如何得云說十二處是密意耶？	此既非有，如何得云說十二處是密意耶？	Since this does not exist, how can it be said that the explanation of the twelve sense bases is the underlying intent?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b02_2']	此亦非理，由其更說法無自性，是極重事，欲令悟入，世尊遂說色等諸法而無自性，欲使諸餘諸大菩薩得彼如來殊勝妙位，周遍生界為大勝益。	此亦非理，由其更說法無自性，是極重事，欲令悟入，世尊遂說色等諸法而無自性，欲使諸餘諸大菩薩得彼如來殊勝妙位，周遍生界為大勝益。	This is also unreasonable, because it further explains that dharmas are without self-nature, which is a very serious matter. Wishing to cause understanding and entry, the World-Honored One then says that form and so forth are dharmas without self-nature. Wishing to cause the other great bodhisattvas to attain that Tathāgata's supreme and wondrous position, to benefit the world of beings in all its vastness.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b02_7']	此如何作？	此如何作？	How is this done?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b03_2']	謂色等諸法相似現前，但唯是心。	謂色等諸法相似現前，但唯是心。	It is said that form and so forth are similar to what appears before us, but are only mind.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b04_1']	除識已外，曾無片物為色等性是可見事。	除識已外，曾無片物為色等性是可見事。	Apart from consciousness, there is never a single thing that can be seen as having the nature of form and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b04_15']	由是故知，色等諸法無有自性。	由是故知，色等諸法無有自性。	Therefore, we know that form and so forth are dharmas without self-nature.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b05_17']	斯言意顯諸事自性由自識力變現生起，理成決定。	斯言意顯諸事自性由自識力變現生起，理成決定。	This statement reveals that the self-nature of things is produced by the power of one's own consciousness transforming and manifesting, and the principle is certainly established.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b07_6']	隨其所知所有諸事，並皆離識無別可取，但唯是此而現相狀。	隨其所知所有諸事，並皆離識無別可取，但唯是此而現相狀。	According to what is known, all things are completely apart from consciousness and cannot be grasped separately. They are only this [consciousness] appearing in various forms.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b08_5']	是以故知實無自性，便能悟入法無性理。	是以故知實無自性，便能悟入法無性理。	Therefore, we know that there is truly no self-nature, and one is then able to understand and enter the principle of the naturelessness of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b10_1']	有說若為悟入法無性者，此據能勝作是說耶？	有說若為悟入法無性者，此據能勝作是說耶？	Some say: If it is said that in order to awaken to the naturelessness of dharmas, this is said based on the ability to do so,
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b11_17']	所見之境唯是錯亂，據勝義理本性空無，作此宣揚善符中觀，所見境無識非有故。	所見之境唯是錯亂，據勝義理本性空無，作此宣揚善符中觀，所見境無識非有故。	then the seen objects are only mistaken, based on the principle of ultimate truth, essentially empty and non-existent. Making this proclamation well accords with the Middle Way, because the seen objects are non-existent and consciousness is not existent.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b12_7']	斯固未閑作何意趣？	斯固未閑作何意趣？	This is certainly not yet familiar with what meaning is intended.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b14_10']	且說如是心心所法所見之境不稱其事，妄為領納取不實相名為錯亂，豈非但說而唯有識。	且說如是心心所法所見之境不稱其事，妄為領納取不實相名為錯亂，豈非但說而唯有識。	Moreover, it is said that the seen objects of such mind and mental factors do not correspond to the facts, falsely grasping unreal characteristics is called mistaken. How could it not be said that there is only consciousness?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b15_8']	若言諸法一亦無者，爾復如何有所宣說？	若言諸法一亦無者，爾復如何有所宣說？	If it is said that even oneness does not exist, then how can there be any proclamation?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b16_16']	境既是無，識非有故，將夢等喻善為曉之，如上所陳無勞致惑。	境既是無，識非有故，將夢等喻善為曉之，如上所陳無勞致惑。	Since objects are non-existent, and consciousness is not existent, using the analogy of dreams and so forth is good for understanding. As explained above, there is no need to be confused.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b17_11']	不得外境但唯識現，此復云何？	不得外境但唯識現，此復云何？	How is it that external objects are not obtained, but only consciousness appears?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b17_16']	識義非理。	識義非理。	The meaning of consciousness is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b19_1']	若是具義，由於業邊親益果故，即以此言便成答難。	若是具義，由於業邊親益果故，即以此言便成答難。	If it means having meaning, it is because it directly benefits the effect in terms of karma. This statement itself becomes the answer to the objection.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b19_14']	亦復不由體有別故能成方異。	亦復不由體有別故能成方異。	It also does not mean that it can accomplish distinction by having a separate substance.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b20_11']	有說能持自體，此中復云是自性義。	有說能持自體，此中復云是自性義。	Some say it means to uphold one's own substance, and this is the meaning of self-nature.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b21_1']	此亦同前已分析訖。	此亦同前已分析訖。	This is also the same as what has already been analyzed above.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b22_13']	此義不然，離其作具要有別事方為作用，猶如自己還持自身，故不應也。	此義不然，離其作具要有別事方為作用，猶如自己還持自身，故不應也。	This meaning is not correct. Apart from the instrument of action, there must be a separate matter in order to function, just as one's own self still upholds one's own body, so it is not appropriate.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b23_12']	為欲令生悟法無性說唯有識，將為契當。	為欲令生悟法無性說唯有識，將為契當。	In order to cause the understanding of the non-existence of dharmas, it is said that there is only consciousness, which is considered to be correct.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b26_4']	若言總無，一切諸法皆無有我，由此名為我無自性，斯即共許我之自性悉皆非有，如是便成法無自性，諸法非有。	若言總無，一切諸法皆無有我，由此名為我無自性，斯即共許我之自性悉皆非有，如是便成法無自性，諸法非有。	If it is said that in general all dharmas are without self, and for this reason it is called the selflessness of dharmas, then this is generally accepted that the self-nature of self is all non-existent. In this way, it becomes the selflessness of dharmas, and all dharmas do not exist.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b26_14']	由是故知，識亦同爾。	由是故知，識亦同爾。	For this reason, one should know that consciousness is also the same.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b27_7']	性既非有，如何於此欲為安立？	性既非有，如何於此欲為安立？	Since its nature does not exist, how can one establish it here?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b28_6']	為彼諸法並非有者，猶如假我更連趣性。	為彼諸法並非有者，猶如假我更連趣性。	If those dharmas are all non-existent, they are like a hypothetical self that continues in a series.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090b29_5']	無自體者此是所許，更連趣體全無性也。	無自體者此是所許，更連趣體全無性也。	The absence of self-nature is what is accepted, that the nature of continuation in a series is completely non-existent.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c01_4']	此則便成法無性者，謂一切法皆無性故。	此則便成法無性者，謂一切法皆無性故。	This then becomes the non-existence of dharmas, meaning that all dharmas are without nature.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c01_13']	是故應知識亦同爾。	是故應知識亦同爾。	Therefore, one should know that consciousness is also the same.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c02_11']	此既非有，如何依此欲使迷人入法無性？	此既非有，如何依此欲使迷人入法無性？	Since this does not exist, how can one rely on this to cause deluded people to enter the non-existence of dharmas?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c03_6']	由無有我，遂令證入諸法無性。	由無有我，遂令證入諸法無性。	Due to the non-existence of a self, one is caused to realize the non-existence of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c03_16']	共許如斯，為善方便。	共許如斯，為善方便。	This is universally accepted as a skillful means.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c04_5']	爾者如何欲為建立？	爾者如何欲為建立？	Then how does one wish to establish it?
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c05_17']	成彼方便說十二處證人無性，實非全無一切諸法，方始名為法無自性。	成彼方便說十二處證人無性，實非全無一切諸法，方始名為法無自性。	The skillful means of establishing that the twelve sense bases prove the non-existence of a person is not actually the complete non-existence of all dharmas, which is then called the absence of self-nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1591_004:0090c07_16']	是故應知，法無性聲非詮諸法皆無自體，更連趣言亦同於此，不欲總詮一切非有。	是故應知，法無性聲非詮諸法皆無自體，更連趣言亦同於此，不欲總詮一切非有。	Therefore, one should know that the sound of the absence of self-nature of dharmas does not refer to the complete absence of self-nature of all dharmas. The word continuation in a series is also the same as this, not wishing to refer to the complete non-existence of everything.
