['ZH_T31_1604_005:0613b17_15']	貪光及信光二光無二法者，如是貪等煩惱光及信等善法光，如是二光亦無染淨二法。	貪光及信光二光無二法者，如是貪等煩惱光及信等善法光，如是二光亦無染淨二法。	The light of craving and the light of faith, the two lights are not two dharmas means that the light of afflictions such as craving and the light of wholesome dharmas such as faith, these two lights are also not the two dharmas of defilement and purity.
