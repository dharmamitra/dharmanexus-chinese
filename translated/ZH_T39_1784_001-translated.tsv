In recent years, Master Gu Shan also used chapters and records to clarify the subtle meaning. Why is it being compiled again now?

['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b09_11']	寶雲講次，學徒隨錄，義或闕如，未及補治，不幸歸寂。	寶雲講次，學徒隨錄，義或闕如，未及補治，不幸歸寂。	When Baoyun lectured, his students recorded it, but the meaning was sometimes incomplete, and he had not yet had time to revise it. Unfortunately, he passed away.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b10_8']	孤山之製多事消文，復於中間毀除觀心。	孤山之製多事消文，復於中間毀除觀心。	Gu Shan's writings often focused on explaining the text, and he also criticized and removed the contemplation of the mind in the middle.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b12_5']	斯實不忍，今故秉筆，拾先師遺餘之義、拾後人遺棄之文，使教行二塗不至壅蔽。	斯實不忍，今故秉筆，拾先師遺餘之義、拾後人遺棄之文，使教行二塗不至壅蔽。	This is truly unbearable. Therefore, I now hold the brush to pick up the meaning left behind by my former teacher and pick up the text abandoned by later people, so that the two paths of teaching and practice will not be obstructed.

['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b16_2']	能釋乃通，由智者師解釋諸經皆立五義，故以所釋揀非他部。	能釋乃通，由智者師解釋諸經皆立五義，故以所釋揀非他部。	The explainer is generally applicable, because the master Zhizhe explained all sutras by establishing five meanings, therefore, using what is explained to distinguish it from other texts.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b16_16']	入文廣解經題四字，故不預敘。	入文廣解經題四字，故不預敘。	The four characters of the sutra title are extensively explained in the text, therefore, they are not described in advance.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b18_1']	能釋二字者，玄謂幽微難見也，義謂理趣深有所以也。	能釋二字者，玄謂幽微難見也，義謂理趣深有所以也。	The two characters of the explainer, xuan means profound and difficult to see, yi means the profound principle has a deep reason.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b20_4']	其幽微義而有五重，蓋一經始終能詮之名、所召之體、即體之宗、宗成力用，此四言教通局相狀。	其幽微義而有五重，蓋一經始終能詮之名、所召之體、即體之宗、宗成力用，此四言教通局相狀。	The profound meaning has five layers, which are the name that can be expounded from beginning to end of a sutra, the essence that is called, the essence that is the main point, the power and function of accomplishing the main point, and the appearance of the general and specific teachings of these four.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b22_3']	大師搜抉如是五義解釋一題，欲令學者預知經旨然後尋文，使於文文成智行故。	大師搜抉如是五義解釋一題，欲令學者預知經旨然後尋文，使於文文成智行故。	The great master searched and selected these five meanings to explain a title, wanting to let learners first know the meaning of the sutra and then search for the text, so that in every text they can accomplish the practice of wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b24_1']	斯是道場持因靜發，稱會佛心演茲奧旨，故不可以暗證者及尋文者同日而語也。	斯是道場持因靜發，稱會佛心演茲奧旨，故不可以暗證者及尋文者同日而語也。	This is the cause of upholding the Way field, which arises from stillness, and is called the meeting of the Buddha's mind expounding this profound meaning, therefore, it cannot be spoken of on the same day as those who have dark realization and those who search for the text.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b24_10']	幽微所以豈虛名哉？	幽微所以豈虛名哉？	How could the profound and subtle be empty names?

The Great Master is the model for all beings. As for expounding, it distinguishes from other teachers holding a brush and composing.

['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012b29_19']	甚深無量，明體德也。	甚深無量，明體德也。	Extremely profound and immeasurable clarifies the virtue of the essence.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c01_12']	應知此經三字別題是法非譬。	應知此經三字別題是法非譬。	It should be known that the three characters of this sūtra's separate title are the Dharma, not metaphors.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c01_17']	何以知然？	何以知然？	How can this be known?
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c04_18']	經敘如來游於無量甚深法性諸佛行處，乃住此定而便唱云「是金光明，諸經之王」，豈非直指所游法性名金光明，不云法性如金光明。	經敘如來游於無量甚深法性諸佛行處，乃住此定而便唱云「是金光明，諸經之王」，豈非直指所游法性名金光明，不云法性如金光明。	The sutra describes the Tathāgata roaming in the immeasurable and profound Dharma-nature, the place where all Buddhas abide, and then proclaims that this is the King of Sutras, the Golden Light. How could it not be directly pointing to the Dharma-nature that is roamed as being called the Golden Light, not saying that the Dharma-nature is like gold or light?
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c06_14']	而下文所立譬喻一釋者，蓋以諸師解金光明為世物象，用譬如來所得深法。	而下文所立譬喻一釋者，蓋以諸師解金光明為世物象，用譬如來所得深法。	The simile established in the text below is only using the masters' explanations of the golden light as worldly objects to illustrate the profound Dharma attained by the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c08_8']	諸師雖乃用譬顯法，其實不知法相圓融，隨名局解，是故不能遍譬諸法。	諸師雖乃用譬顯法，其實不知法相圓融，隨名局解，是故不能遍譬諸法。	Although the masters use similes to illustrate the Dharma, in reality they do not know the perfect interfusion of the characteristics of the Dharma. They understand according to the names, so they cannot universally illustrate all dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c11_15']	大師欲示金光明海無法不備、無法不融，故順諸師以金光明三字為譬，具足比況佛之所游，略則十種三法，廣則一切法門，一一互融皆不思議。	大師欲示金光明海無法不備、無法不融，故順諸師以金光明三字為譬，具足比況佛之所游，略則十種三法，廣則一切法門，一一互融皆不思議。	The Great Master wishes to show that the ocean of the golden light is replete with all dharmas and that all dharmas are perfectly fused, so he follows the masters in using the three characters golden light as similes, fully illustrating the place roamed by the Buddha. Briefly, there are ten kinds of three dharmas, and extensively, all Dharma gates, each perfectly fused and inconceivable.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c12_14']	此乃格他譬法不周，因此廣顯法性圓具。	此乃格他譬法不周，因此廣顯法性圓具。	This is refuting his analogy as incomplete, and using it to extensively reveal the perfect possession of the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c15_6']	然雖順他以譬顯法，其如經題是法非譬，故後自立附文、當體二種解釋，斥彼義推譬喻疎遠，依經就法方為親切。	然雖順他以譬顯法，其如經題是法非譬，故後自立附文、當體二種解釋，斥彼義推譬喻疎遠，依經就法方為親切。	Although following others, using analogies to reveal the Dharma, the title of the sutra is the Dharma, not an analogy. Therefore, later establishing two kinds of explanations based on the text and the essence of the Dharma, refuting his meaning as far-fetched and distant, relying on the sutra and the Dharma is truly intimate.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c17_5']	斯由大師深解法性可尊可貴當體名金，寂而常照當體名光，大悲益物當體稱明。	斯由大師深解法性可尊可貴當體名金，寂而常照當體名光，大悲益物當體稱明。	This is because the great master deeply understands the nature of dharmas, which can be respected and valued, and is called gold in essence, which is tranquil yet always illuminating, and is called light in essence, which greatly benefits beings and is called brightness in essence.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c18_5']	是知法性具金光明，真實名義究竟成就也。	是知法性具金光明，真實名義究竟成就也。	Know that the nature of dharmas possesses the golden light, and the true meaning is ultimately accomplished.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c18_19']	除法性外，所有名言皆無實義。	除法性外，所有名言皆無實義。	Apart from the nature of dharmas, all names and words are without real meaning.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c21_6']	故金光明三種法門，舉一即三、全三是一，非三非一而一而三，不縱不橫絕思絕議，是祕密藏佛所游處。	故金光明三種法門，舉一即三、全三是一，非三非一而一而三，不縱不橫絕思絕議，是祕密藏佛所游處。	Therefore, the three kinds of Dharma gates of gold, light, and brightness, taking one is three, and the whole three is one, neither three nor one, yet one and three, not vertical nor horizontal, beyond thought and discussion, is the secret treasury where the Buddha dwells.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c24_7']	又復應知，以金光明示法體者，即五章體，蓋由此經以金光明為名、以金光明為體、以金光明為宗、以金光明為用、以金光明而為教相。	又復應知，以金光明示法體者，即五章體，蓋由此經以金光明為名、以金光明為體、以金光明為宗、以金光明為用、以金光明而為教相。	Moreover, it should be known that the demonstration of the essence of the Dharma through the Golden Light is the essence of the five chapters. It is because this sūtra takes the Golden Light as its name, takes the Golden Light as its essence, takes the Golden Light as its main purport, takes the Golden Light as its function, and takes the Golden Light as its doctrinal characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c25_12']	亦可三字別對五章，以金為體、以光為宗、以明為用；	亦可三字別對五章，以金為體、以光為宗、以明為用；	It can also be said that the three characters correspond separately to the five chapters, taking the Golden as the essence, the Light as the main purport, and the Bright as the function;
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c26_5']	總三為名，分別三名而為教相。	總三為名，分別三名而為教相。	taking the three together as the name, and distinguishing the three names as the doctrinal characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c28_19']	法體既爾，體德合然，甚深是光之德窮法性底故，無量是明之德達法性邊故，此二不二是金之德，法性究竟尊貴義故。	法體既爾，體德合然，甚深是光之德窮法性底故，無量是明之德達法性邊故，此二不二是金之德，法性究竟尊貴義故。	Since the essence of the Dharma is like this, the essence and virtues are combined in the same way. Profound is the virtue of the Light because it reaches the bottom of the Dharma-nature, immeasurable is the virtue of the Bright because it penetrates the limits of the Dharma-nature, and the non-duality of these two is the virtue of the Golden because it signifies the ultimate nobility of the Dharma-nature.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0012c29_15']	亦可三義皆甚深、皆無量、皆不二。	亦可三義皆甚深、皆無量、皆不二。	It can also be said that the three meanings are all profound, all immeasurable, and all non-dual.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a01_4']	五章之德莫不如是。	五章之德莫不如是。	The virtues of the five chapters are all like this.

['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a07_13']	初、約我辨，上至極果下及庸凡皆不能令妙理有說。	初、約我辨，上至極果下及庸凡皆不能令妙理有說。	First, discussing from the perspective of self, from the highest fruition to the most ordinary, none can cause the wondrous truth to have speech.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a07_17']	更分三：	更分三：	It is further divided into three:
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a08_9']	初、明果人不能盡喻。	初、明果人不能盡喻。	First, clarifying that the fruition person cannot fully illustrate it.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a09_13']	四佛說偈，山斤、海滴、地塵、空界，皆不能比釋尊壽命。	四佛說偈，山斤、海滴、地塵、空界，皆不能比釋尊壽命。	The four buddhas spoke verses, saying that the weight of mountains, the drops in the ocean, the dust on the earth, and the realms in space, none can compare to Śākyamuni's lifespan.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a10_11']	此之四喻，虛空最大，以山等三依空立故。	此之四喻，虛空最大，以山等三依空立故。	Among these four analogies, space is the greatest, because the three such as mountains are established based on space.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a12_17']	虛空雖大，而是妄心變起之境，迷真故生、悟性則滅，與眼作對、心緣所及，安能盡喻不可思議金光明耶？	虛空雖大，而是妄心變起之境，迷真故生、悟性則滅，與眼作對、心緣所及，安能盡喻不可思議金光明耶？	Although space is vast, it is a realm arisen from the deluded mind. It arises from delusion of truth and ceases upon realization of the nature. How can it compare to the inconceivable golden light?
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a14_3']	故經云「空生大覺中，如海一漚發」，寧將一漚類乎大海？	故經云「空生大覺中，如海一漚發」，寧將一漚類乎大海？	Therefore, the sutra says, Space arises within great enlightenment, like a single bubble in the ocean. How can a single bubble be compared to the great ocean?
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a14_13']	空向莫喻，三那可論？	空向莫喻，三那可論？	How can space even be a metaphor for it, let alone the three?

['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a16_2']	經云「空等莫比釋尊所得壽命」，今何得云不類大覺及金光明？	經云「空等莫比釋尊所得壽命」，今何得云不類大覺及金光明？	The sutra says, Space and so forth cannot compare to the lifespan attained by Shakyamuni. Why is it said now that it cannot be compared to great enlightenment and the golden light?
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a16_4']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a17_15']	覺性若少金等三義則不名大，釋尊壽命義當於明，不具金光則非永壽。	覺性若少金等三義則不名大，釋尊壽命義當於明，不具金光則非永壽。	If the enlightened nature lacks the three meanings of gold and so forth, it is not called great. Shakyamuni's lifespan corresponds to light, and lacking the golden light is not eternal life.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a19_5']	一法不少、三法不多，生佛無差、體用不二，若不爾者非方等義。	一法不少、三法不多，生佛無差、體用不二，若不爾者非方等義。	One dharma is not little, and three dharmas are not many. There is no difference between sentient beings and Buddhas, and essence and function are non-dual. If it were not so, it would not be the meaning of Vaipulya.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a20_1']	四佛世尊喻不能及，彰理絕言也。	四佛世尊喻不能及，彰理絕言也。	The four Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, cannot compare to it, manifesting the principle beyond words.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a20_11']	二、明因位未能窮源。	二、明因位未能窮源。	Second, it clarifies that the stage of causes and conditions is still unable to fathom the source.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a21_11']	上舉果佛證雖究竟，而法本寂滅，故言喻莫彰；	上舉果佛證雖究竟，而法本寂滅，故言喻莫彰；	Above, it is said that the fruition Buddha's realization is ultimate, but the Dharma is originally quiescent and extinct, so words and analogies cannot express it.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a22_7']	今辨因人未到性源，故擬議非及。	今辨因人未到性源，故擬議非及。	Now, it is explained that the person of causes and conditions has not yet reached the source of the nature, so conceptual thinking is not adequate.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a22_12']	此自為二：	此自為二：	This has two parts:
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a22_21']	初、約喻以智斷斥。	初、約喻以智斷斥。	First, using analogies to refute wisdom and severance.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a25_2']	日輪赫奕喻智德般若，嬰兒之眼喻空假觀慧，既違本智則非佛眼，故於智德赫日非所瞻仰。	日輪赫奕喻智德般若，嬰兒之眼喻空假觀慧，既違本智則非佛眼，故於智德赫日非所瞻仰。	The blazing sun wheel is an analogy for the wisdom of the virtue of wisdom. The eyes of an infant are an analogy for the wisdom of the contemplation of emptiness and conventionality. Since it goes against the original wisdom, it is not the Buddha eye, so in the blazing sun of the virtue of wisdom, it is not what is looked up to.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a27_4']	大舶樓櫓喻斷德解脫，新產之婦喻生法緣慈，既異無緣則無妙力，故於斷德樓櫓非所執持。	大舶樓櫓喻斷德解脫，新產之婦喻生法緣慈，既異無緣則無妙力，故於斷德樓櫓非所執持。	The towers and watchtowers of a great ship are an analogy for the liberation of the virtue of severance. The newly delivered woman is an analogy for the compassionate skillful means of giving rise to dharmas. Since it is different from the skillful means of the absence of discrimination, it lacks marvelous power, so in the towers and watchtowers of the virtue of severance, it is not what is held onto.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a28_5']	此約圓果三智三脫，斥前三教菩薩悲智故也。	此約圓果三智三脫，斥前三教菩薩悲智故也。	This uses the three wisdoms and three liberations of the perfect fruition to refute the compassion and wisdom of the bodhisattvas of the three teachings.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013a29_4']	若圓菩薩修既即性，則能從始不乖二德。	若圓菩薩修既即性，則能從始不乖二德。	If the perfect bodhisattva's cultivation is already identical to the nature, then from the beginning he is able to not contradict the two virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013b02_12']	然雖解即，若因望果，智有明昧、力分強弱，是故因人於果智斷亦非瞻仰及以執持，須了智斷名為光明。	然雖解即，若因望果，智有明昧、力分強弱，是故因人於果智斷亦非瞻仰及以執持，須了智斷名為光明。	Although understanding is immediate, if cause is compared to effect, wisdom has clarity and obscurity, and power has strong and weak divisions. Therefore, the person in the cause also does not look up to or hold on to the wisdom and severance of the effect. One must understand that wisdom and severance are called light.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0013b03_7']	二德不二，即是法身，復名為金。	二德不二，即是法身，復名為金。	The two virtues are non-dual, which is precisely the Dharma body, and is also called gold.

Examining this, we know that the attached text and the intrinsic nature explanation are the correct meaning of the present.

['ZH_T39_1784_001:0017a28_2']	因茲大師同他用譬，遍譬一切圓融法門。	因茲大師同他用譬，遍譬一切圓融法門。	Because of this, the great master uses metaphors like others, and metaphors all the perfect and harmonious Dharma gates.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0017a29_9']	此之法門雖從譬顯，乃是預示當體釋中法金光明諸異名耳。	此之法門雖從譬顯，乃是預示當體釋中法金光明諸異名耳。	Although this Dharma gate is manifested from metaphors, it is a preliminary indication of the Dharma, gold, light, and brightness, and various different names in the intrinsic nature explanation.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0017b03_7']	蓋由法性具無量德、有無量名，名金光明，亦名法身般若解脫，亦名法報應，亦名正緣了，乃至名苦惑業，一攝一切、一切入一。	蓋由法性具無量德、有無量名，名金光明，亦名法身般若解脫，亦名法報應，亦名正緣了，乃至名苦惑業，一攝一切、一切入一。	It is because the nature of the Dharma possesses immeasurable virtues and has immeasurable names. It is called gold, light, and brightness, and is also called Dharma body, prajñā, and liberation. It is also called true, reward, and response. It is also called correct, conditioned, and understood. It is even called suffering, delusion, and karma. One includes all, and all enter one.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0017b05_4']	以約所譬說此義已，至當體中但定三字非譬是法，法必遍融，則於一切無二無別。	以約所譬說此義已，至當體中但定三字非譬是法，法必遍融，則於一切無二無別。	Having explained this meaning in terms of what is illustrated, when we get to the main body of the text, we will simply determine that the three characters are not illustrations but the Dharma. The Dharma must be all-pervasively integrated, and then there is no duality or distinction in anything.
['ZH_T39_1784_001:0017b06_14']	然若得知法金光明是諸三法中一種名者，即曉此經立題之旨也。	然若得知法金光明是諸三法中一種名者，即曉此經立題之旨也。	However, if one knows that the Dharma, gold, light, and brightness are one kind of name among the three dharmas, then one understands the purport of the title of this sutra.
