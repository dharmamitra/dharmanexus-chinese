It also seems that the sequential and perfect and harmonious are separate. The teachings and practices do not know the nature of dharmas, and the teachings and practices are neither identical nor separate. Therefore, before the grounds it only reveals the perfect and harmonious that surpasses the three vehicles, and on the grounds it often clarifies the sequential to show the superiority.
['ZH_T35_1735_031:0735c22_11']	勝相云何？	勝相云何？	031	What are the superior characteristics?
['ZH_T35_1735_031:0735c24_8']	謂賢位始終已圓融自在，登地已去則甚深甚深，言所不至，若不寄位何以顯深？	謂賢位始終已圓融自在，登地已去則甚深甚深，言所不至，若不寄位何以顯深？	031	It means that from the beginning to the end of the sage stage, it is already perfectly harmonious and free. Once one has ascended the grounds, it becomes extremely profound and profound, beyond the reach of words. If one does not rely on stages, how can one show the profundity?
['ZH_T35_1735_031:0735c25_1']	不包三乘何以顯廣？	不包三乘何以顯廣？	031	If it does not encompass the three vehicles, how can it show the vastness?
['ZH_T35_1735_031:0735c27_16']	故虛空鳥迹迹迹合空，大海十德德德皆海，地地之中具攝一切諸地功德，文文之內皆云若以殊勝願力復過於此不可數知。	故虛空鳥迹迹迹合空，大海十德德德皆海，地地之中具攝一切諸地功德，文文之內皆云若以殊勝願力復過於此不可數知。	031	Therefore, like the tracks of a bird in the sky, each track merges with the sky. Like the ten virtues of the great ocean, each virtue is the ocean. Within each ground, it fully includes all the merits of all the grounds. Within each text, it all says that if one has superior vows, it surpasses this and cannot be counted.
['ZH_T35_1735_031:0735c29_6']	故剛藏俟五請而方說，世親以六相而圓融，意在斯矣。	故剛藏俟五請而方說，世親以六相而圓融，意在斯矣。	031	Therefore, Vajra Treasury waited for five requests before speaking, and Vasubandhu used the six characteristics to perfectly harmonize. The intention is in this.

['ZH_T35_1735_031:0736a08_6']	若別立方便、勝進，即不得包攝前後顯地圓融。	若別立方便、勝進，即不得包攝前後顯地圓融。	031	If one were to establish separate skillful means and superior progress, then one would not be able to comprehensively include the preceding and succeeding, manifesting the perfect interfusion of the grounds.

Although the function may wane and wax, the wisdom is without arising and ceasing, like the space it relies on, which is not impermanent. Therefore, the sutra clarifies that this wisdom is ultimately like space.

However, in terms of the double negation, both do not abide. If in terms of the double affirmation, both are abiding. This means that due to great compassion, one always dwells in saṃsāra, and so on.
