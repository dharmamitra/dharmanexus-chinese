Next, having separately analyzed the faculties, objects, and non-self, we will now comprehensively discuss the emptiness of the characteristics of the conditioned.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0236b20_17']	後位如先果應不起，先位如後果亦應生。	後位如先果應不起，先位如後果亦應生。	In the later stage, the prior effect should not arise. In the prior stage, the later effect should also arise.

The latter refers to the cause of the destruction of the combined virtues, while the former refers to the combined virtues that obstruct heaviness, etc., preventing the arising of the action of falling, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0236c15_1']	如是合德其體未有，應不能違先所起業。	如是合德其體未有，應不能違先所起業。	In this way, if the combined virtues do not yet exist, they should not be able to contradict the previously arisen action.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0236c16_18']	俱有相違，勿違自宗因果不竝。	俱有相違，勿違自宗因果不竝。	They are mutually contradictory. Do not contradict your own tenet that cause and effect do not occur simultaneously.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0236c17_17']	若許一念業與合俱，後亦應然，無差別故。	若許一念業與合俱，後亦應然，無差別故。	If you allow that action occurs simultaneously with the combination, then it should be so afterwards as well, because there is no difference.

Because the cause does not exist, the meaning of the effect is not established. It contradicts one's own school's establishment of the existence of cause and effect.

This should be explained in the same way as above.

The first, middle, and last stages are manifested based on existence, but when it has not yet arisen, the essence does not exist, so how can it be established?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0237c08_17']	或應許果未起非無，見彼三時唯依有故。	或應許果未起非無，見彼三時唯依有故。	Or it should be allowed that the effect is not nonexistent before it arises, because seeing those three stages is only based on existence.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0237c26_1']	一法一時自為因果，理不成故，非從自生。	一法一時自為因果，理不成故，非從自生。	Because it is not logically possible for one dharma at one time to be its own cause and effect, it does not arise from itself.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0237c26_19']	若一體中有二相別說為因果，自義不成。	若一體中有二相別說為因果，自義不成。	If within one essence there are two distinct aspects called cause and effect, one's own meaning is not established.

The characteristics should not be established as two, just as their essence. Therefore, the statement that one essence with two characteristics is called cause and effect is definitely not logically possible.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0238a06_8']	他解不生發言無益，何緣強立自生論耶？	他解不生發言無益，何緣強立自生論耶？	If understanding does not arise in others, speaking is of no benefit. On what basis would one forcefully establish the doctrine of self-arising?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0238a07_7']	現見世間法從緣起，言自生者與此相違。	現見世間法從緣起，言自生者與此相違。	It is clearly seen in the world that dharmas arise from conditions. The doctrine of self-arising contradicts this.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0238a08_7']	又若自生應違世法，刀不自割、針不自縫。	又若自生應違世法，刀不自割、針不自縫。	Moreover, if it arises by itself, it should contradict worldly dharmas. A knife does not cut itself, a needle does not sew itself.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0238a09_14']	又自生言依汝生，不依汝生者非謂自生，不依汝生應非汝說。	又自生言依汝生，不依汝生者非謂自生，不依汝生應非汝說。	Moreover, the doctrine of self-arising depends on you for arising. If it does not depend on you for arising, it is not called self-arising. If it does not depend on you for arising, it should not be your doctrine.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241a27_1']	已生位故，瓶體定無。	已生位故，瓶體定無。	But the state of arising has not yet arrived, and therefore the substance of the pot definitely does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241a27_11']	瓶體既無，生依何法？	瓶體既無，生依何法？	Since the substance of the pot does not exist, what dharma does arising depend on?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241a28_17']	不可無法名作生時，勿一切無皆名生位，故應於有立生時名。	不可無法名作生時，勿一切無皆名生位，故應於有立生時名。	You cannot say that a nonexistent dharma is called the state of arising, lest all nonexistents be called the state of arising. Therefore you should call the state of existence the state of arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b01_15']	若謂生時其體已有無斯過者，此亦不然，未至已生與未生位無差別故，有義不成。	若謂生時其體已有無斯過者，此亦不然，未至已生與未生位無差別故，有義不成。	If you say that the substance of the state of arising exists and is not subject to this error, this is also not reasonable, because there is no difference between the state of arising and the state of nonexistence prior to arising, and therefore existence is not established.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b02_14']	若謂生時是未來世，最後位故非體全無。	若謂生時是未來世，最後位故非體全無。	If you say that the state of arising is the future because it is the final state and its substance is not completely nonexistent,
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b03_13']	此不應理，同未來攝等非已生，無前後故。	此不應理，同未來攝等非已生，無前後故。	this is unreasonable, because it is categorized as future and equal to that which has not yet arisen, and there is no sequence.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b04_13']	若未來世半有半無，有同已生，世應雜亂。	若未來世半有半無，有同已生，世應雜亂。	If the future is half existent and half nonexistent, and existence is the same as that which has already arisen, then time would be in disorder.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b05_2']	故生時位，但有虛言。	故生時位，但有虛言。	Therefore the state of arising is just an empty word.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b05_12']	生時既無，生亦非有。	生時既無，生亦非有。	Since the state of arising does not exist, arising also does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b07_1']	復次若謂生時體雖未滿，而用起故非是全無。	復次若謂生時體雖未滿，而用起故非是全無。	Furthermore, if you say that although the substance is not yet complete at the time of arising, the function arises, so it is not completely non-existent.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b12_1']	未生生時無用有用，二位差別，理不可然。	未生生時無用有用，二位差別，理不可然。	The two states of no function and function at the time of arising before arising are unreasonable.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b12_11']	生時體無，用應非有。	生時體無，用應非有。	If the substance does not exist at the time of arising, the function should not exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b13_1']	生時體有，應是已生。	生時體有，應是已生。	If the substance exists at the time of arising, it should be already arisen.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b13_20']	設許生時有能起用，而體未有，應名未生。	設許生時有能起用，而體未有，應名未生。	Even if it is allowed that at the time of arising there is the ability to give rise to function, but the substance is not yet, it should be called not yet arisen.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b14_17']	非未生名別有少法，但遮已起名未生時。	非未生名別有少法，但遮已起名未生時。	The name not yet arisen does not refer to a separate dharma, but only denies what has already arisen and calls it the time before arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b15_8']	既名未生，何能簡彼？	既名未生，何能簡彼？	Since it is called not yet arisen, how can it distinguish that?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b15_18']	若少有體，應名已生。	若少有體，應名已生。	If there is a little substance, it should be called already arisen.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b16_7']	既非已生，應無少體。	既非已生，應無少體。	Since it is not already arisen, it should have no substance at all.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b17_5']	不可一法半有半無，有無相違不同體故。	不可一法半有半無，有無相違不同體故。	It is impossible for a single dharma to be partially existent and partially nonexistent, because existence and nonexistence are mutually contradictory and cannot share the same substance.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b18_6']	若許體別，有即已生、無即未生，生時豈有？	若許體別，有即已生、無即未生，生時豈有？	If you allow that the substance is different, then existence is already arisen and nonexistence is not yet arisen. How can there be arising at the moment of arising?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b18_15']	故離二位無別生時。	故離二位無別生時。	Therefore, apart from the two states, there is no separate moment of arising.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b20_11']	為顯此因，故說頌曰：	為顯此因，故說頌曰：	In order to illustrate this reason, a verse is spoken:🔽In the prior state, the moment of arising is nonexistent,

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b24_1']	未起用時名為前位，於此前位未有生時。	未起用時名為前位，於此前位未有生時。	The state prior to the commencement of function is called the prior state. In this prior state, there is no moment of arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b24_19']	正起用時名為後位，於此後位方有生時。	正起用時名為後位，於此後位方有生時。	The state in which the function is just commencing is called the subsequent state. In this subsequent state, there is a moment of arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b25_18']	是則生時成已生位，有異前故，如已生時。	是則生時成已生位，有異前故，如已生時。	This means that the moment of arising is the state of already arisen, because it is different from the prior state, just like the moment of already arisen.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b26_8']	非體全無，可與前異。	非體全無，可與前異。	The substance is not completely nonexistent, and can be different from the prior state.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b26_18']	所言兼者，謂捨全無。	所言兼者，謂捨全無。	The word “also” means “completely.”
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b27_16']	即未生時名全無位，生時捨彼，是有非無。	即未生時名全無位，生時捨彼，是有非無。	That is, when it has not yet arisen, it is called the state of complete nonexistence. When it arises, it abandons that nonexistence and becomes existent, not nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b28_14']	由此兼前成已生位，若捨無位必至有時。	由此兼前成已生位，若捨無位必至有時。	Because of this, it combines with the previous [state of nonexistence] to form the state of having already arisen. If one abandons the state of nonexistence, one must reach a time [when it exists].
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241b29_13']	有即已生中無異位，依何而立別有生時？	有即已生中無異位，依何而立別有生時？	Existence is no different from the state of having already arisen. Based on what can one establish a separate state of arising?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c01_13']	是故生時即已生位，非無有故，如已生時。	是故生時即已生位，非無有故，如已生時。	Therefore, the state of arising is the state of having already arisen. Because it is not nonexistent, it is like the state of having already arisen.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c02_12']	又此生時應許有體，若無有體，生用應無。	又此生時應許有體，若無有體，生用應無。	Moreover, this state of arising should be accepted as having a substance. If it has no substance, the function of arising should be nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c03_1']	體用並無，生時豈有？	體用並無，生時豈有？	With both substance and function being nonexistent, how can there be a state of arising?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c04_9']	若無體用而有生時，則一切無皆應頓起，無無異故，如此生時。	若無體用而有生時，則一切無皆應頓起，無無異故，如此生時。	If there is a state of arising without substance or function, then everything that is nonexistent should all arise suddenly, because nonexistence is no different from this state of arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c05_7']	又若生時體用非有，因緣和合應無所為。	又若生時體用非有，因緣和合應無所為。	Moreover, if the substance and function of the state of arising do not exist, the combination of causes and conditions should be without effect.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c06_6']	有不生無，如前已說，故生時位是有非無。	有不生無，如前已說，故生時位是有非無。	Nonexistent arising exists, as explained above. Therefore, the state of arising is existent, not nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c07_5']	有即已生，更無異位，故不應立別有生時。	有即已生，更無異位，故不應立別有生時。	That which exists is already arisen, and there is no other state apart from that, therefore it is not appropriate to establish a separate time of arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c08_10']	復次無別生時理應信受。	復次無別生時理應信受。	Moreover, one should believe and accept that there is no separate time of arising.

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c10_8']	有即已起，無即未生，除此孰為生時位體？	有即已起，無即未生，除此孰為生時位體？	If it exists, it is already arisen. If it does not exist, it has not yet arisen. Apart from this, what is the essence of the state of the time of arising?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c10_18']	為顯此理，復說頌曰：	為顯此理，復說頌曰：	To illustrate this principle, we further state a verse:

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c14_1']	所執生時，推徵其性不過二種，謂有及無。	所執生時，推徵其性不過二種，謂有及無。	The nature of the time of arising that is grasped is no more than two kinds when investigated, namely existence and nonexistence.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c15_8']	如是有無二位所攝，除此無別中間生時，汝等何緣非理橫執？	如是有無二位所攝，除此無別中間生時，汝等何緣非理橫執？	These two states of existence and nonexistence encompass it. Apart from this, there is no separate intermediate time of arising. For what reason do you unreasonably and falsely grasp it?

['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c16_16']	故應信受無別生時。	故應信受無別生時。	Therefore, one should believe and accept that there is no separate time of arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c17_7']	生時既無，生如何有？	生時既無，生如何有？	Since there is no arising at the time of arising, how can there be arising?
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c17_16']	是故諸法理實無生。	是故諸法理實無生。	Therefore, in reality, all dharmas are without arising.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c18_6']	生既實無，住滅亦爾。	生既實無，住滅亦爾。	Since arising is in reality nonexistent, abiding and ceasing are also like this.
['ZH_T30_1571_009:0241c19_4']	生為先故，非有義成，故不別遮住滅二相。	生為先故，非有義成，故不別遮住滅二相。	Because arising precedes, the meaning of existence is established, and therefore the two characteristics of abiding and ceasing are not separately refuted.
