['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a01_17']	三明雖知因起，未盡重重，故云「尚越彼明」，況於三乘小乘六通之境。	三明雖知因起，未盡重重，故云「尚越彼明」，況於三乘小乘六通之境。	074	Although the three knowledges know the arising of causes, they have not yet exhausted the layers upon layers, so it is said that they still surpass those knowledges, let alone the realm of the three vehicles, the two vehicles, and the six supernormal powers.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a02_1']	次有難云：	次有難云：	074	Next, there is an objection:

['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a11_1']	緣境不如實，如知自心智，不知如佛境。	緣境不如實，如知自心智，不知如佛境。	074	The object is not known as it really is, just as the knowledge of one's own mind does not know as the Buddha's realm.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a11_16']	」不知如佛境者，唯佛得本質故。	」不知如佛境者，唯佛得本質故。	074	Not knowing as the Buddha's realm means only the Buddha can attain the substance.

['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a18_6']	一云「攝境從心不壞境」者，即示心境有無。	一云「攝境從心不壞境」者，即示心境有無。	074	First, it says Including the object in the mind does not destroy the object, which shows the existence or non-existence of mind and object.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a18_16']	彼得本質，恐壞唯心。	彼得本質，恐壞唯心。	074	They obtain the original substance, fearing it would destroy the mind-only.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a19_7']	既不壞境，得之何妨？	既不壞境，得之何妨？	074	Since the object is not destroyed, how can obtaining it be hindered?
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a19_12']	壞有何失？	壞有何失？	074	What is the loss in destruction?
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a20_10']	以無心者「無心於萬物，萬物未嘗無。	以無心者「無心於萬物，萬物未嘗無。	074	Because the mindless one has no mind towards myriad things, myriad things are never nonexistent.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a21_4']	此得在於神靜，失在於物虛。	此得在於神靜，失在於物虛。	074	This obtaining lies in the stillness of the spirit, the loss lies in the emptiness of things.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a21_11']	」謂物實有故。	」謂物實有故。	074	It is said that things truly exist.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a22_10']	若唯心壞境，則得在於境空，失在於心有。	若唯心壞境，則得在於境空，失在於心有。	074	If only the mind destroys the object, then the obtaining lies in the emptiness of the object, the loss lies in the existence of the mind.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a23_3']	故以境由心變，故說唯心。	故以境由心變，故說唯心。	074	Therefore, since the object is transformed by the mind, it is said to be mind-only.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a23_13']	所變不無，何必須壞？	所變不無，何必須壞？	074	The transformation is not nonexistent, why must it be destroyed?

Therefore, it is said that using the mind to eliminate the object, when the object is eliminated the mind is also gone, it is not just the mind remaining alone.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a27_18']	二云「能所兩亡不礙存故」者，上不壞境且遣懼質之病，今遣空有之理，故心境並許，存亡心境相籍故。	二云「能所兩亡不礙存故」者，上不壞境且遣懼質之病，今遣空有之理，故心境並許，存亡心境相籍故。	074	The second says the two of subject and object are both gone, yet it does not hinder their existence - above, not destroying the object is to eliminate the illness of fearing the substance. Now, eliminating the principle of emptiness and existence, therefore both object and mind are allowed to exist. Because the existence and non-existence of mind and object rely on each other.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584a29_7']	空有相依，緣生故有，有即存也、空即亡也，空有交徹，存亡兩全。	空有相依，緣生故有，有即存也、空即亡也，空有交徹，存亡兩全。	074	Emptiness and existence rely on each other. Because of dependent arising, there is existence, which is presence, and emptiness, which is absence. Emptiness and existence interpenetrate, with presence and absence both complete.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584b01_12']	三云「第一義唯心非一非異」者，正出具分唯心之理。	三云「第一義唯心非一非異」者，正出具分唯心之理。	074	The third says the ultimate truth is mind only, neither the same nor different - this directly brings out the principle of the complete mind-only.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584b02_11']	上第一釋，雖有唯心之義，尚通生滅唯心。	上第一釋，雖有唯心之義，尚通生滅唯心。	074	In the first explanation above, although there is the meaning of mind-only, it still generally includes the mind-only of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584b03_10']	第二義，雖兩亡不󰊋，而未言心境相攝。	第二義，雖兩亡不󰊋，而未言心境相攝。	074	The second meaning, although both are absent and not concealed, it has not yet been said that the mind and objects mutually include each other.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584b04_6']	今明具分唯識，故云第一義唯心。	今明具分唯識，故云第一義唯心。	074	Now, it clarifies the complete consciousness-only, therefore it says the ultimate truth is mind only.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584b05_4']	同第一義故非異，不壞能所故非一。	同第一義故非異，不壞能所故非一。	074	Because it is the same as the ultimate truth, it is not different. Because the subject and object are not destroyed, it is not the same.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584b05_18']	非一，故有能所緣，他義成矣；	非一，故有能所緣，他義成矣；	074	Because it is not the same, there is the subject and object, and the meaning of other is established.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0584b06_13']	非異，故能所平等，唯心義成矣。	非異，故能所平等，唯心義成矣。	074	Because it is not different, the subject and object are equal, and the meaning of mind-only is established.

This is because these three are all the intrinsic nature of birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0588c28_1']	從此相如星下，別解星喻。	從此相如星下，別解星喻。	074	From this characteristic is like stars below, it separately explains the metaphor of stars.

The analogy of stars below explains the three analogies separately. It should say these characteristics are like stars, like cataracts, like lamps.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0589a18_9']	以星喻在初，故先牒解耳。	以星喻在初，故先牒解耳。	074	Because the analogy of stars is first, it is first brought up and explained.

Now the analogy of stars is used to illustrate the seeing part. Stars have the ability to illuminate, the same as the seeing part. It also accords with Vasubandhu's statement that the mind that can see is also like this.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0589a21_15']	翳喻相分猶有妄見，謂有空花之外相故。	翳喻相分猶有妄見，謂有空花之外相故。	074	The analogy of the cataract is that the image part still has false seeing, because there is the external image of empty flowers.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0589a22_8']	燈喻自證分，此不異論。	燈喻自證分，此不異論。	074	The analogy of the lamp is for the self-authenticating part, which is not different from the treatise.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0589a24_3']	若為此解，亦順偈中見相及於識，義次第故，亦得論家共相見識解自性義。	若為此解，亦順偈中見相及於識，義次第故，亦得論家共相見識解自性義。	074	If this is understood, it also accords with the order of seeing, image, and consciousness in the verse, and one can also understand the meaning of the self-nature of the treatise's common seeing of consciousness.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0589a25_10']	又通八識三分，共是識故而為自相，不獨第六而為共等。	又通八識三分，共是識故而為自相，不獨第六而為共等。	074	Moreover, it is common to the three parts of the eight consciousnesses, because they are all consciousness, and thus are the specific characteristics, not just the sixth consciousness being the common characteristics, etc.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0589a27_7']	論別解星喻，言無智暗中有光等者，若無般若喻之如暗，便有見分名有彼光。	論別解星喻，言無智暗中有光等者，若無般若喻之如暗，便有見分名有彼光。	074	The treatise separately explains the analogy of the star, saying that in the darkness of ignorance there is light, etc. If there is no prajñā, it is like darkness, and then there is the seeing part, called having that light.
['ZH_T36_1736_074:0589a28_9']	若有智日識見便空，云有智明中無彼光矣。	若有智日識見便空，云有智明中無彼光矣。	074	If there is the sun of wisdom, the seeing of consciousness is immediately empty, and it is said that in the light of wisdom there is no that light.
