In the beginning, it says that it gives rise to two kinds.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c17_1']	此二既在隨動門中。	此二既在隨動門中。	02b	Since these two are in the gate of following movement,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c17_6']	故云生也。	故云生也。	02b	Therefore, it is called giving rise.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c17_15']	生已不離不動覺體。	生已不離不動覺體。	02b	After arising, it is not separate from the unmoving essence of enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c18_6']	故云與彼不相離也。	故云與彼不相離也。	02b	Therefore, it is said that it is inseparable from that.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c20_6']	云何為二一者智淨相二者不思議業相　言智淨相者。	云何為二一者智淨相二者不思議業相　言智淨相者。	02b	What are the two? First, the characteristic of the purity of wisdom; second, the characteristic of inconceivable activity. As for the characteristic of the purity of wisdom,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c20_16']	明本覺隨染還淨之相。	明本覺隨染還淨之相。	02b	It clarifies the characteristic of the originally enlightened mind that follows defilements and returns to purity.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c21_14']	明還淨本覺業用之相。	明還淨本覺業用之相。	02b	It clarifies the characteristic of the function of the originally enlightened mind returning to purity.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c22_8']	此之二相若離染緣則不得成。	此之二相若離染緣則不得成。	02b	These two characteristics cannot be accomplished if one is separated from the conditions of defilement.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c23_4']	故云隨染也○第三辨相中二。	故云隨染也○第三辨相中二。	02b	Therefore, it says in accordance with defilement. The third part on distinguishing the characteristics is also in two parts.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c23_9']	先明智淨。	先明智淨。	02b	First, it clarifies the purity of wisdom.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c25_2', 'ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c27_11']	初因後果。🔽智淨相者謂依法力熏習如實修行滿足方便故　因中依法力熏習者。	初因後果。 智淨相者謂依法力熏習如實修行滿足方便故　因中依法力熏習者。	02b	First, the cause, and later, the effect.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c28_1']	謂真如內熏之力。	謂真如內熏之力。	02b	The characteristic of the purity of wisdom refers to the power of the Dharma's perfuming and the fulfillment of expedient means through the practice of suchness. The cause is as follows: The power of the Dharma's perfuming refers to the power of the inner perfuming of suchness,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c28_11']	及所流教法外緣熏力。	及所流教法外緣熏力。	02b	and the power of the external conditions of the teachings that flow from it.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c28_16']	此在地前。	此在地前。	02b	This is on the stage before the grounds.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c29_10']	依此熏力修習資糧加行善根。	依此熏力修習資糧加行善根。	02b	Relying on the power of this perfuming, one cultivates the wholesome roots of the stage of accumulating and the stage of preparation.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c29_15']	登地已上。	登地已上。	02b	Once one has ascended to the grounds and above,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a01_2']	行契證如。	行契證如。	02b	one's practice accords with and realizes suchness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a01_9']	故云如實修行。	故云如實修行。	02b	Therefore, it says the practice of suchness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a02_2']	十地行終故云滿足方便。	十地行終故云滿足方便。	02b	Because the practices of the ten grounds are completed, it says the fulfillment of expedient means.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a04_8']	初斷果。	初斷果。	02b	First, the fruit of cutting off.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a04_12']	後智果。	後智果。	02b	Later, the fruit of wisdom.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a05_8']	由前方便能破和合識內生滅之相。	由前方便能破和合識內生滅之相。	02b	Due to the previous expedient means, one can break the characteristics of birth and cessation within the combined consciousness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a05_16']	顯其不生滅之性。	顯其不生滅之性。	02b	Manifest its unproduced and unceasing nature.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a06_9']	此根本無明盡故心無所合。	此根本無明盡故心無所合。	02b	Because this fundamental ignorance is exhausted, the mind has nothing to combine with.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a07_1']	即顯法身本覺義也。	即顯法身本覺義也。	02b	This manifests the meaning of the originally enlightened Dharma body.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a08_1']	即於此時能滅染心之中業相等相續之相。	即於此時能滅染心之中業相等相續之相。	02b	At this very moment, one can extinguish the characteristics of the continuous mind, such as the characteristics of activity in the defiled mind, etc.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a08_9']	不滅相續心體故。	不滅相續心體故。	02b	Because it does not extinguish the essence of the continuous mind.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a09_3']	令隨染本覺之心遂即還源。	令隨染本覺之心遂即還源。	02b	It causes the mind that follows the defiled original enlightenment to return to its source.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a09_18']	成於應身始覺義也。	成於應身始覺義也。	02b	It accomplishes the meaning of the enlightened mind of the reward body.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a10_8']	然此始覺無別始起。	然此始覺無別始起。	02b	However, this enlightened mind does not arise anew.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a10_17']	即是本覺隨染作也。	即是本覺隨染作也。	02b	It is precisely the originally enlightened mind that follows defilement and acts.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a11_8']	今染緣既息始還同本。	今染緣既息始還同本。	02b	Now that the conditions of defilement have ceased, the enlightened mind returns to its original state.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a12_5']	故云淳淨也○釋疑中初問後答。	故云淳淨也○釋疑中初問後答。	02b	Therefore, it is said to be pure. In resolving doubts, there is first a question and then an answer.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a12_13']	問中執真同妄難。	問中執真同妄難。	02b	The question is a difficulty in holding the true to be the same as the false.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a13_2']	後簡妄異真答。	後簡妄異真答。	02b	Later, the false is distinguished from the true in the answer.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a14_8']	此義云何　難意云。	此義云何　難意云。	02b	What does this mean? The meaning of the question is as follows.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a14_13']	如上所說。	如上所說。	02b	As explained above,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a15_4']	動彼靜心成於起滅。	動彼靜心成於起滅。	02b	the still mind is moved to create arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a15_11']	今既盡於生滅。	今既盡於生滅。	02b	Now, since arising and ceasing are exhausted,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a15_16']	應滅靜心。	應滅靜心。	02b	the still mind should cease.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a16_13']	故云此義云何也○答中法喻合三也。	故云此義云何也○答中法喻合三也。	02b	Therefore, it says What does this mean? The answer combines the principle and an analogy.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a18_12']	以一切心識之相皆是無明無明之相不離覺性非可壞非不可壞　答意云。	以一切心識之相皆是無明無明之相不離覺性非可壞非不可壞　答意云。	02b	All the characteristics of mind and consciousness are ignorance. The characteristics of ignorance are not apart from the nature of enlightenment. They cannot be destroyed and cannot not be destroyed. The meaning of the answer is as follows.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a19_3']	業等染心名諸識相。	業等染心名諸識相。	02b	The defiled mind of karma and so forth is called the characteristics of various consciousnesses.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a19_12']	此等皆是不覺之相。	此等皆是不覺之相。	02b	These are all the characteristics of non-enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a20_5']	故云心識之相皆是無明。	故云心識之相皆是無明。	02b	Therefore, it says All the characteristics of mind and consciousness are ignorance.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a20_12']	非約心體說也。	非約心體說也。	02b	It is not speaking about the essence of mind.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a20_18']	又更轉難云。	又更轉難云。	02b	Moreover, it turns to a further difficulty, saying:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a21_12']	既言識相皆是無明故說滅者。	既言識相皆是無明故說滅者。	02b	Since it is said that the characteristics of consciousness are all ignorance, therefore it is said to cease.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a22_6']	即應別有體性離於真如。	即應別有體性離於真如。	02b	Then there should be a separate essence apart from true suchness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a22_14']	即真妄別體難也。	即真妄別體難也。	02b	This is the difficulty of the separate essences of the true and false.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a22_17']	答云。	答云。	02b	The answer says:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a23_15']	如此諸識不覺之相不離隨染本覺之性。	如此諸識不覺之相不離隨染本覺之性。	02b	The characteristics of non-enlightenment of these various consciousnesses are inseparable from the nature of the originally enlightened mind that accords with defilements.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a24_7']	以是故云不離覺性。	以是故云不離覺性。	02b	Therefore, it is said that they are not apart from the nature of enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a25_5']	此無明之相與彼本覺之性非一非異。	此無明之相與彼本覺之性非一非異。	02b	The characteristics of this ignorance and the nature of the originally enlightened mind are neither the same nor different.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a25_12']	非異故非可壞。	非異故非可壞。	02b	Not different, it cannot be destroyed.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a26_3']	非一故非不可壞。	非一故非不可壞。	02b	Not the same, it cannot not be destroyed.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a26_12']	若依非異非可壞義。	若依非異非可壞義。	02b	If one relies on the meaning of neither being different nor destructible,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a27_1']	說無明即明。	說無明即明。	02b	ignorance is said to be enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a27_7']	故涅槃經云。	故涅槃經云。	02b	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a27_16']	明與無明其性不二。	明與無明其性不二。	02b	Enlightenment and ignorance have the same nature.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a28_6']	不二之性即是實性。	不二之性即是實性。	02b	The nature of non-duality is precisely the true nature.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a28_16']	若就非一非不可壞義。	若就非一非不可壞義。	02b	If one relies on the meaning of neither being the same nor indestructible,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a29_8']	說無明滅覺性不壞。	說無明滅覺性不壞。	02b	it is said that when ignorance ceases, the enlightened nature is not destroyed.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b01_5']	滅惑之義準此知之○喻中四句。	滅惑之義準此知之○喻中四句。	02b	The meaning of extinguishing delusions should be understood according to this. The four phrases in the analogy are:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b04_8']	如大海水因風波動水相風相不相捨離而水非動性若風止滅動相則滅濕性不壞故　初句真隨妄轉喻。	如大海水因風波動水相風相不相捨離而水非動性若風止滅動相則滅濕性不壞故　初句真隨妄轉喻。	02b	Like the water of the great ocean, it moves and becomes waves due to the wind. The characteristics of the water and the wind are inseparable, yet the water is not of the nature of movement. If the wind stops and ceases, the moving characteristics cease, but the wet nature is not destroyed. The first phrase is an analogy for the true mind following the arising of delusion.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b04_16']	次水風不相離者。	次水風不相離者。	02b	Next, the water and wind are inseparable.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b05_3']	真妄相依喻。	真妄相依喻。	02b	The metaphor of true and false mutually relying on each other.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b05_9']	水非動性者。	水非動性者。	02b	The water is not of the nature of movement.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b05_15']	真體不變喻。	真體不變喻。	02b	The metaphor of the unchanging essence of truth.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b06_8']	此顯非自性動但隨他動也。	此顯非自性動但隨他動也。	02b	This shows that it is not self-nature movement, but only following other movements.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b07_2']	若風止滅下息妄顯真喻。	若風止滅下息妄顯真喻。	02b	If the wind ceases and disappears, the metaphor of ceasing delusion and revealing truth.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b07_10']	此明若自性動者。	此明若自性動者。	02b	This clarifies that if it were self-nature movement,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b08_1']	動相滅時濕性隨滅。	動相滅時濕性隨滅。	02b	when the movement ceased, the wet nature would also cease.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b08_8']	而但隨他動故。	而但隨他動故。	02b	But because it only follows other movements,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b09_7']	動相滅時濕性不壞也○合中次第合之。	動相滅時濕性不壞也○合中次第合之。	02b	when the movement ceases, the wet nature is not destroyed. The combination follows the order of the metaphor.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b12_15']	如是眾生自性清淨心因無明風動心與無明俱無形相不相捨離而心非動性若無明滅相續則滅智性不壞故　初淨心合海也。	如是眾生自性清淨心因無明風動心與無明俱無形相不相捨離而心非動性若無明滅相續則滅智性不壞故　初淨心合海也。	02b	In this way, the intrinsically pure mind of sentient beings moves due to the wind of ignorance. The mind and ignorance are both formless and inseparable, yet the mind is not of the nature of movement. If ignorance ceases, the continuity ceases, but the nature of wisdom is not destroyed. First, the pure mind corresponds to the ocean.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b13_3']	因無明動者。	因無明動者。	02b	The cause of movement due to ignorance.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b13_12']	合風起水成於波浪。	合風起水成於波浪。	02b	Corresponds to the wind rising and the water forming waves.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b14_2']	以水不能自浪。	以水不能自浪。	02b	Because the water cannot form waves by itself.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b14_9']	要因風起波也。	要因風起波也。	02b	It must depend on the wind to form waves.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b14_17']	風不能自現動相。	風不能自現動相。	02b	The wind cannot manifest the appearance of movement by itself.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b15_8']	要依於水方現動也。	要依於水方現動也。	02b	It must depend on the water to manifest movement.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b15_13']	故動即水。	故動即水。	02b	Therefore, movement is water.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b16_2']	動無別體也。	動無別體也。	02b	Movement has no separate substance.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b16_7']	所況可知。	所況可知。	02b	The rest can be understood.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b16_16']	俱無形相不相離者。	俱無形相不相離者。	02b	Both have no form or characteristics and are inseparable
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b17_3']	合相依也。	合相依也。	02b	Means they are combined and dependent on each other.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b17_9']	以濕全動故。	以濕全動故。	02b	Because wetness is entirely movement,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b17_14']	無於水相。	無於水相。	02b	There are no characteristics of water.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b18_3']	以動全濕故。	以動全濕故。	02b	Because movement is entirely wet,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b18_8']	無於風相。	無於風相。	02b	There are no characteristics of wind.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b18_13']	心法亦爾。	心法亦爾。	02b	Mental phenomena are also like this.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b19_3']	真心隨熏全作識浪。	真心隨熏全作識浪。	02b	The true mind, according to perfuming, completely becomes the waves of consciousness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b19_8']	故無心相。	故無心相。	02b	Therefore, there are no characteristics of the mind.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b19_17']	然彼識浪無非是真。	然彼識浪無非是真。	02b	However, those waves of consciousness are all true.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b20_4']	故無無明相。	故無無明相。	02b	Therefore, there are no characteristics of ignorance.
