In the beginning, it says that it gives rise to two kinds.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c17_1']	此二既在隨動門中。	此二既在隨動門中。	Since these two are in the gate of following movement,

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c17_15']	生已不離不動覺體。	生已不離不動覺體。	After arising, it is not separate from the unmoving essence of enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c18_6']	故云與彼不相離也。	故云與彼不相離也。	Therefore, it is said that it is inseparable from that.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c20_6']	云何為二一者智淨相二者不思議業相　言智淨相者。	云何為二一者智淨相二者不思議業相　言智淨相者。	What are the two? First, the characteristic of the purity of wisdom; second, the characteristic of inconceivable activity. As for the characteristic of the purity of wisdom,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c20_16']	明本覺隨染還淨之相。	明本覺隨染還淨之相。	It clarifies the characteristic of the originally enlightened mind that follows defilements and returns to purity.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c28_1']	謂真如內熏之力。	謂真如內熏之力。	The characteristic of the purity of wisdom refers to the power of the Dharma's perfuming and the fulfillment of expedient means through the practice of suchness. The cause is as follows: The power of the Dharma's perfuming refers to the power of the inner perfuming of suchness,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0259c28_11']	及所流教法外緣熏力。	及所流教法外緣熏力。	and the power of the external conditions of the teachings that flow from it.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a01_9']	故云如實修行。	故云如實修行。	Therefore, it says the practice of suchness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a02_2']	十地行終故云滿足方便。	十地行終故云滿足方便。	Because the practices of the ten grounds are completed, it says the fulfillment of expedient means.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a02_11']	此在金剛因位極也。	此在金剛因位極也。	This is the ultimate stage of the vajra cause.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a06_9']	此根本無明盡故心無所合。	此根本無明盡故心無所合。	Because this fundamental ignorance is exhausted, the mind has nothing to combine with.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a07_1']	即顯法身本覺義也。	即顯法身本覺義也。	This manifests the meaning of the originally enlightened Dharma body.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a08_1']	即於此時能滅染心之中業相等相續之相。	即於此時能滅染心之中業相等相續之相。	At this very moment, one can extinguish the characteristics of the continuous mind, such as the characteristics of activity in the defiled mind, etc.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a08_9']	不滅相續心體故。	不滅相續心體故。	Because it does not extinguish the essence of the continuous mind.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a09_3']	令隨染本覺之心遂即還源。	令隨染本覺之心遂即還源。	It causes the mind that follows the defiled original enlightenment to return to its source.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a09_18']	成於應身始覺義也。	成於應身始覺義也。	It accomplishes the meaning of the enlightened mind of the reward body.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a10_8']	然此始覺無別始起。	然此始覺無別始起。	However, this enlightened mind does not arise anew.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a10_17']	即是本覺隨染作也。	即是本覺隨染作也。	It is precisely the originally enlightened mind that follows defilement and acts.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a11_8']	今染緣既息始還同本。	今染緣既息始還同本。	Now that the conditions of defilement have ceased, the enlightened mind returns to its original state.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a12_5']	故云淳淨也○釋疑中初問後答。	故云淳淨也○釋疑中初問後答。	Therefore, it is said to be pure. In resolving doubts, there is first a question and then an answer.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a12_13']	問中執真同妄難。	問中執真同妄難。	The question is a difficulty in holding the true to be the same as the false.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a14_8']	此義云何　難意云。	此義云何　難意云。	What does this mean? The meaning of the question is as follows.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a14_13']	如上所說。	如上所說。	As explained above,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a15_4']	動彼靜心成於起滅。	動彼靜心成於起滅。	the still mind is moved to create arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a15_11']	今既盡於生滅。	今既盡於生滅。	Now, since arising and ceasing are exhausted,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a15_16']	應滅靜心。	應滅靜心。	the still mind should cease.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a16_13']	故云此義云何也○答中法喻合三也。	故云此義云何也○答中法喻合三也。	Therefore, it says What does this mean? The answer combines the principle and an analogy.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a18_12']	以一切心識之相皆是無明無明之相不離覺性非可壞非不可壞　答意云。	以一切心識之相皆是無明無明之相不離覺性非可壞非不可壞　答意云。	All the characteristics of mind and consciousness are ignorance. The characteristics of ignorance are not apart from the nature of enlightenment. They cannot be destroyed and cannot not be destroyed. The meaning of the answer is as follows.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a19_3']	業等染心名諸識相。	業等染心名諸識相。	The defiled mind of karma and so forth is called the characteristics of various consciousnesses.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a19_12']	此等皆是不覺之相。	此等皆是不覺之相。	These are all the characteristics of non-enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a20_5']	故云心識之相皆是無明。	故云心識之相皆是無明。	Therefore, it says All the characteristics of mind and consciousness are ignorance.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a20_12']	非約心體說也。	非約心體說也。	It is not speaking about the essence of mind.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a20_18']	又更轉難云。	又更轉難云。	Moreover, it turns to a further difficulty, saying:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a21_12']	既言識相皆是無明故說滅者。	既言識相皆是無明故說滅者。	Since it is said that the characteristics of consciousness are all ignorance, therefore it is said to cease.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a22_6']	即應別有體性離於真如。	即應別有體性離於真如。	Then there should be a separate essence apart from true suchness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a22_14']	即真妄別體難也。	即真妄別體難也。	This is the difficulty of the separate essences of the true and false.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a22_17']	答云。	答云。	The answer says:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a23_15']	如此諸識不覺之相不離隨染本覺之性。	如此諸識不覺之相不離隨染本覺之性。	The characteristics of non-enlightenment of these various consciousnesses are inseparable from the nature of the originally enlightened mind that accords with defilements.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a24_7']	以是故云不離覺性。	以是故云不離覺性。	Therefore, it is said that they are not apart from the nature of enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a25_5']	此無明之相與彼本覺之性非一非異。	此無明之相與彼本覺之性非一非異。	The characteristics of this ignorance and the nature of the originally enlightened mind are neither the same nor different.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a25_12']	非異故非可壞。	非異故非可壞。	Not different, it cannot be destroyed.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a26_3']	非一故非不可壞。	非一故非不可壞。	Not the same, it cannot not be destroyed.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a26_12']	若依非異非可壞義。	若依非異非可壞義。	If one relies on the meaning of neither being different nor destructible,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a27_1']	說無明即明。	說無明即明。	ignorance is said to be enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a27_7']	故涅槃經云。	故涅槃經云。	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a27_16']	明與無明其性不二。	明與無明其性不二。	Enlightenment and ignorance have the same nature.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a28_6']	不二之性即是實性。	不二之性即是實性。	The nature of non-duality is precisely the true nature.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a28_16']	若就非一非不可壞義。	若就非一非不可壞義。	If one relies on the meaning of neither being the same nor indestructible,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260a29_8']	說無明滅覺性不壞。	說無明滅覺性不壞。	it is said that when ignorance ceases, the enlightened nature is not destroyed.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b01_5']	滅惑之義準此知之○喻中四句。	滅惑之義準此知之○喻中四句。	The meaning of extinguishing delusions should be understood according to this. The four phrases in the analogy are:
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b04_8']	如大海水因風波動水相風相不相捨離而水非動性若風止滅動相則滅濕性不壞故　初句真隨妄轉喻。	如大海水因風波動水相風相不相捨離而水非動性若風止滅動相則滅濕性不壞故　初句真隨妄轉喻。	Like the water of the great ocean, it moves and becomes waves due to the wind. The characteristics of the water and the wind are inseparable, yet the water is not of the nature of movement. If the wind stops and ceases, the moving characteristics cease, but the wet nature is not destroyed. The first phrase is an analogy for the true mind following the arising of delusion.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b04_16']	次水風不相離者。	次水風不相離者。	Next, the water and wind are inseparable.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b05_3']	真妄相依喻。	真妄相依喻。	The metaphor of true and false mutually relying on each other.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b05_9']	水非動性者。	水非動性者。	The water is not of the nature of movement.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b05_15']	真體不變喻。	真體不變喻。	The metaphor of the unchanging essence of truth.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b06_8']	此顯非自性動但隨他動也。	此顯非自性動但隨他動也。	This shows that it is not self-nature movement, but only following other movements.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b07_2']	若風止滅下息妄顯真喻。	若風止滅下息妄顯真喻。	If the wind ceases and disappears, the metaphor of ceasing delusion and revealing truth.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b07_10']	此明若自性動者。	此明若自性動者。	This clarifies that if it were self-nature movement,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b08_1']	動相滅時濕性隨滅。	動相滅時濕性隨滅。	when the movement ceased, the wet nature would also cease.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b08_8']	而但隨他動故。	而但隨他動故。	But because it only follows other movements,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b09_7']	動相滅時濕性不壞也○合中次第合之。	動相滅時濕性不壞也○合中次第合之。	when the movement ceases, the wet nature is not destroyed. The combination follows the order of the metaphor.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b12_15']	如是眾生自性清淨心因無明風動心與無明俱無形相不相捨離而心非動性若無明滅相續則滅智性不壞故　初淨心合海也。	如是眾生自性清淨心因無明風動心與無明俱無形相不相捨離而心非動性若無明滅相續則滅智性不壞故　初淨心合海也。	In this way, the intrinsically pure mind of sentient beings moves due to the wind of ignorance. The mind and ignorance are both formless and inseparable, yet the mind is not of the nature of movement. If ignorance ceases, the continuity ceases, but the nature of wisdom is not destroyed. First, the pure mind corresponds to the ocean.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b13_3']	因無明動者。	因無明動者。	The cause of movement due to ignorance.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b13_12']	合風起水成於波浪。	合風起水成於波浪。	Corresponds to the wind rising and the water forming waves.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b14_2']	以水不能自浪。	以水不能自浪。	Because the water cannot form waves by itself.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b14_9']	要因風起波也。	要因風起波也。	It must depend on the wind to form waves.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b14_17']	風不能自現動相。	風不能自現動相。	The wind cannot manifest the appearance of movement by itself.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b15_13']	故動即水。	故動即水。	Therefore, movement is water.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b16_2']	動無別體也。	動無別體也。	Movement has no separate substance.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b17_3']	合相依也。	合相依也。	Means they are combined and dependent on each other.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b17_9']	以濕全動故。	以濕全動故。	Because wetness is entirely movement,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b17_14']	無於水相。	無於水相。	There are no characteristics of water.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b18_3']	以動全濕故。	以動全濕故。	Because movement is entirely wet,

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b19_3']	真心隨熏全作識浪。	真心隨熏全作識浪。	The true mind, according to perfuming, completely becomes the waves of consciousness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b19_8']	故無心相。	故無心相。	Therefore, there are no characteristics of the mind.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0260b19_17']	然彼識浪無非是真。	然彼識浪無非是真。	However, those waves of consciousness are all true.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a11_10']	又亦可初明不覺體。	又亦可初明不覺體。	Moreover, it can also be said that the first clarifies the essence of non-awakening,

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a12_14']	初依覺成迷。	初依覺成迷。	First, it relies on awakening to form delusion.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a13_2']	後依迷顯覺。	後依迷顯覺。	Later, it relies on delusion to manifest awakening.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a13_8']	亦則釋疑也。	亦則釋疑也。	It also resolves doubts.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a14_1']	以彼妄依真起無別體故。	以彼妄依真起無別體故。	Because that which is false relies on the true to arise and has no separate essence,
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a14_8']	還能返顯於真。	還能返顯於真。	It can still turn back to manifest the true.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a14_16']	即是內熏功能也。	即是內熏功能也。	This is the power of internal perfuming.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a15_2']	由是義故。	由是義故。	For this reason,

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a16_6']	以諸妄念必依於真。	以諸妄念必依於真。	Because all false thoughts must rely on the true,

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a17_5']	令此妄念無不返流故也。	令此妄念無不返流故也。	It causes all these false thoughts to return to the source.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a17_10']	初中有三。	初中有三。	There are three parts in the beginning.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a17_16']	謂法喻合也。	謂法喻合也。	Namely, the teaching, analogy, and synthesis.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a19_17']	所言不覺義者謂不如實知真如法一故不覺心起而有其念念無自相不離本覺　法中。	所言不覺義者謂不如實知真如法一故不覺心起而有其念念無自相不離本覺　法中。	As for the meaning of non-awakening, it means not truly understanding the one true suchness, therefore the mind of non-awakening arises and there is thought. Thought has no self-nature and is not apart from the fundamental enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a20_8']	初不了如理一味故。	初不了如理一味故。	First, not understanding the one flavor of suchness.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a20_15']	釋根本不覺義。	釋根本不覺義。	Explaining the meaning of the fundamental non-awakening.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a21_3']	如迷正方也。	如迷正方也。	Like being confused about the correct direction.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a21_9']	不覺念起者。	不覺念起者。	The arising of the thought of non-awakening.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a21_14']	業等相念。	業等相念。	The thought of the characteristics of karma and so forth.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a21_19']	即邪方也。	即邪方也。	This is the wrong direction.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a22_15']	念無自相下明邪無別體不離正方也。	念無自相下明邪無別體不離正方也。	The line thought has no self-nature and is not apart from the fundamental enlightenment clarifies that the wrong does not have a separate essence and is not apart from the correct direction.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a23_7']	即明不覺不離覺也。	即明不覺不離覺也。	This clarifies that non-awakening is not apart from awakening.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a26_1']	猶如迷人依方故迷若離於方則無有迷眾生亦爾依覺故迷若離覺性則無不覺　喻合可知。	猶如迷人依方故迷若離於方則無有迷眾生亦爾依覺故迷若離覺性則無不覺　喻合可知。	It is like a confused person who is confused because of relying on a direction. If one is apart from the direction, then there is no confusion. Sentient beings are also like this. They are confused because of relying on awakening. If they are apart from the essence of awakening, then there is no non-awakening. The analogy and correspondence can be understood.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a29_1']	以有不覺妄想心故能知名義為說真覺若離不覺之心則無真覺自相可說　後文中二。	以有不覺妄想心故能知名義為說真覺若離不覺之心則無真覺自相可說　後文中二。	Because there is the deluded mind of non-awakening, one is able to know names and meanings and explain true awakening. If one is apart from the mind of non-awakening, then there is no self-nature of true awakening that can be explained. In the following text, there are two parts.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262a29_10']	初明妄有起淨之功。	初明妄有起淨之功。	First, clarifying the function of delusion in giving rise to purity.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262b01_1']	後明真有待妄之義。	後明真有待妄之義。	Later, it clarifies the meaning of true existence depending on delusion.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262b01_12']	良以依真之妄方能顯真。	良以依真之妄方能顯真。	This is because delusion that relies on the true can only manifest the true.🔽The true that follows delusion still depends on delusion to be revealed.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262b10_10']	由執定故於違順境取捨追遣。	由執定故於違順境取捨追遣。	Because of grasping, one accepts or rejects agreeable or disagreeable objects and pursues and sends them away.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262b10_16']	執取相亦爾。	執取相亦爾。	The characteristic of grasping is also like this.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262b11_9']	由取相故於上復立名字。	由取相故於上復立名字。	Because of grasping characteristics, names are established on top of that again.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262c11_10']	故言以依動故能見。	故言以依動故能見。	Therefore, it says because it relies on movement, it can see.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262c12_10']	故云不動則無見。	故云不動則無見。	Therefore it is said that if there is no movement, there is no seeing.
['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262c13_1']	反顯能見必依動義。	反顯能見必依動義。	This shows in reverse that seeing must depend on the meaning of movement.

['ZH_T44_1846_02b:0262c14_3']	以境界微細故猶未辨之。	以境界微細故猶未辨之。	because the object is subtle, it is still not discerned.
