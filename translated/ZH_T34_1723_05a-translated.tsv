They have seven kinds of increased and excessive pride and arrogance. In order to counteract this, seven parables are told. It is like taking the constructed city as a real city. This is taking the worldly samādhi and abhi-dharma that are being sought as the true cessation. Because one clings to the perfection of the stage of no more learning, one no longer seeks anything else.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0734c27_9']	二乘無學名無煩惱人，有三種法執染慢，彼三昧解脫見等法執望二乘雖不名染，此迴心已即名菩薩，法執染此菩薩名染無煩惱慢。	二乘無學名無煩惱人，有三種法執染慢，彼三昧解脫見等法執望二乘雖不名染，此迴心已即名菩薩，法執染此菩薩名染無煩惱慢。	Those beyond learning in the two vehicles are called those without afflictions. They have three kinds of pride and arrogance that are tainted by the attachment to dharmas. The attachment to dharmas such as samādhi, liberation, and views, etc. is not called a taint from the perspective of the two vehicles, but once they turn their thoughts, they are called bodhisattvas. The attachment to dharmas that taints these bodhisattvas is called the taint of those without afflictions and pride.

['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a02_10']	論引佛言不離我身是無上義，故二乘中不說此義，不能解故。	論引佛言不離我身是無上義，故二乘中不說此義，不能解故。	The treatise quotes the Buddha's words that the unsurpassed meaning is not apart from one's own body. Therefore, this meaning is not explained in the two vehicles, because they are unable to understand it.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a03_17']	由此無上即是一乘教、理、行、果，隨其所應配諸品取。	由此無上即是一乘教、理、行、果，隨其所應配諸品取。	For this reason, the unsurpassed is precisely the teaching, principles, practices, and fruits of the One Vehicle. As appropriate, they are distributed to the various chapters for understanding.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a06_15']	七種具足煩惱眾生者，第一求勢力人起第一顛倒求功德增上慢，以世間諸煩惱熾然而求天人妙境、果報，為此說火宅喻。	七種具足煩惱眾生者，第一求勢力人起第一顛倒求功德增上慢，以世間諸煩惱熾然而求天人妙境、果報，為此說火宅喻。	As for the seven kinds of beings with complete afflictions, the first person who seeks power gives rise to the first kind of inverted view and seeks the superiority of merits and virtues. Because worldly afflictions are rampant, they seek the wonderful realms and karmic rewards of gods and humans. For their sake, the parable of the burning house is taught.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a09_15']	富貴自在名為勢力，謂諸凡夫求此天人妙境外果并內果報，不知煩惱熾然燒煮，為此說火宅喻，天人勢力煩惱燒煮如火宅故。	富貴自在名為勢力，謂諸凡夫求此天人妙境外果并內果報，不知煩惱熾然燒煮，為此說火宅喻，天人勢力煩惱燒煮如火宅故。	Wealth, nobility, and self-mastery are called power. It refers to ordinary beings seeking these wonderful realms of gods and humans, external fruits, and internal karmic rewards. They do not know that afflictions burn and cook them. Therefore, the parable of the burning house is told, because the power of gods and humans being burned by afflictions is like a burning house.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a13_8']	世尊今者說有二車，即是世間善根三昧，菩提假解令其出宅，後令漸入佛大涅槃，故論云「第一人者以世間種種善根三昧功德，方便令戲，後令入涅槃故。	世尊今者說有二車，即是世間善根三昧，菩提假解令其出宅，後令漸入佛大涅槃，故論云「第一人者以世間種種善根三昧功德，方便令戲，後令入涅槃故。	The World-Honored One now speaks of the two carts, which are the wholesome roots and samādhis of the world. The provisional understanding of bodhi allows them to leave the house, and later makes them gradually enter the Buddha's great nirvāṇa. Therefore, the treatise says, The first person uses the various wholesome roots and samādhi merits of the world as skillful means to make them play, and later makes them enter nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a17_17']	」此中不說解脫道中正證生空擇滅真智名為世間三昧假解，此是羊鹿非是車體，從彼觀後入世間定觀前所證，以心麁故不見正智及生空如，乃見惑、業、後苦不生，心便變作涅槃想解。	」此中不說解脫道中正證生空擇滅真智名為世間三昧假解，此是羊鹿非是車體，從彼觀後入世間定觀前所證，以心麁故不見正智及生空如，乃見惑、業、後苦不生，心便變作涅槃想解。	In this context, the path of liberation is not said to be a worldly samādhi that provisionally understands the true wisdom that directly realizes the emptiness of beings and the cessation of discrimination. This is like a sheep or deer, not the body of the cart. After that contemplation, one enters a worldly concentration and contemplates what was previously realized. Because the mind is coarse, one does not see the true wisdom or the suchness of the emptiness of beings, but rather sees that afflictions, karma, and future suffering will not arise. The mind then transforms and gives rise to the understanding of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a19_11']	正智所證根本觀中所得擇滅，下名化城，不說假觀所變為城，不息苦故。	正智所證根本觀中所得擇滅，下名化城，不說假觀所變為城，不息苦故。	The cessation of discrimination obtained in the fundamental contemplation directly realized by true wisdom is called the transformation city below. It is not said that the city transformed by the provisional contemplation is the city, because suffering has not ceased.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a26_8']	今說後時後得智位能變想解，名為世間善根三昧，輕安、喜樂種種功德，假名羊鹿、假名種智與之遊戲，後化一乘方令入於佛大涅槃，至佛位中能入牛車即是二智、即是菩提，所入涅槃即是寶所，後化城喻二乘執彼惑苦不生故為涅槃，理實涅槃解脫道中是正智證，故說入化城眾商皆倦息。	今說後時後得智位能變想解，名為世間善根三昧，輕安、喜樂種種功德，假名羊鹿、假名種智與之遊戲，後化一乘方令入於佛大涅槃，至佛位中能入牛車即是二智、即是菩提，所入涅槃即是寶所，後化城喻二乘執彼惑苦不生故為涅槃，理實涅槃解脫道中是正智證，故說入化城眾商皆倦息。	Now, it is said that at the later time, in the stage of subsequent attainment wisdom, one is able to transform conceptual understanding, which is called the worldly roots of goodness samādhi, with various merits such as lightness, comfort, joy, and bliss. Provisionally named as the sheep, deer, and provisional wisdom, one plays with them. Later, transforming into the One Vehicle, one is then caused to enter the Buddha's great nirvāṇa. Reaching the Buddha's stage, one is able to enter the ox-drawn cart, which is precisely the two wisdoms, which is precisely bodhi. The nirvāṇa that is entered is precisely the treasure place. Later, the parable of the illusory city, the two vehicles cling to it, and deluded suffering does not arise, therefore it is called nirvāṇa. The principle is actually that nirvāṇa is the correct wisdom realized in the path of liberation. Therefore, it is said that the multitude of merchants all rested in the illusory city.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735a28_18']	前後諸智皆悉不能了一切法故，實非種智，說羊鹿車有名不見登，說此世間三昧善根，與令遊戲故。	前後諸智皆悉不能了一切法故，實非種智，說羊鹿車有名不見登，說此世間三昧善根，與令遊戲故。	The various wisdoms before and after are all unable to understand all dharmas, therefore they are actually not the wisdom of the species. It is said that the sheep and deer carts have names but are not seen to ascend. It is said that these worldly samādhi roots of goodness are given so that one may play with them.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0735b01_15']	二乘執此以為二車，實非車體，如二乘者所起四顛倒，正觀不然，後方想解；	二乘執此以為二車，實非車體，如二乘者所起四顛倒，正觀不然，後方想解；	The two vehicles grasp this as two carts, but they are not actually the body of the carts, like the four inverted views arisen by the two vehicles. Correct contemplation is not like this, and is only imagined later.

Why should we examine the reasons? It is just that expedient means is a specific meaning within the Dharma, while parables are a general name within analogies. Since the general and specific are different, the names are accordingly different, and they cannot be taken as examples of each other.

Subsequent predictions, such as for those of the learner stage and the post-learner stage who have the same title. Although they are also of lower faculties and not well-known to the masses, they are given predictions later.

After the mind has been aroused, they only hear the Lotus Sūtra and there is not a single one who does not become a buddha.

The same is recorded in the fourth fascicle below. There are those not in the assembly, and the Buddha ordered them to transmit the record.

['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c18_15']	《涅槃經》言「須陀洹八萬劫到，乃至阿羅漢二萬劫到，辟支佛十千劫到」，所言到者到阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，故知經爾所劫方到十信初心、始入初劫。	《涅槃經》言「須陀洹八萬劫到，乃至阿羅漢二萬劫到，辟支佛十千劫到」，所言到者到阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，故知經爾所劫方到十信初心、始入初劫。	The Nirvana Sutra says, Srota-āpannas reach in 80,000 kalpas, up to arhats reaching in 20,000 kalpas, and pratyekabuddhas reaching in 10,000 kalpas. What is meant by reaching is reaching the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment. Therefore, it is known that after passing through that many kalpas, one finally reaches the initial stage of the ten faiths and begins the first kalpa.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c20_6']	〈菩薩地〉言「迂迴修行不如初心始業菩薩，耽寂滅味極深重故」。	〈菩薩地〉言「迂迴修行不如初心始業菩薩，耽寂滅味極深重故」。	The Bodhisattva Stage says: The practice of the bodhisattvas who have newly generated the mind is superior to the roundabout practice, because they are extremely deeply attached to the taste of quiescence and extinction.

['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c22_13']	一種姓定，遇緣便能證於正覺；	一種姓定，遇緣便能證於正覺；	The first is the certainty of lineage. When conditions are encountered, one is able to realize perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c23_7']	二發心定，發大心已更不退轉；	二發心定，發大心已更不退轉；	The second is the certainty of generating the mind. After generating the great mind, one does not regress again.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c24_8', 'ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c25_6']	三不虛行，定得自在已於利有情終不空過。🔽初在地前，五種菩提中發心菩提故；	三不虛行，定得自在已於利有情終不空過。 初在地前，五種菩提中發心菩提故；	The third is the certainty of not practicing in vain. Having attained mastery, one never passes in vain over benefiting sentient beings.🔽The first is on the stage before the grounds, because it is the bodhicitta among the five kinds of bodhicitta;
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c25_16']	次在初地，證發心故；	次在初地，證發心故；	The next is on the first ground, because it is the realization of bodhicitta;

['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c26_11']	今依初定故與授記。	今依初定故與授記。	Now, based on the first certainty, the prediction is given.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c28_5']	釋妨難者，論云「彼聲聞等為實成佛故與記別，為不成佛與授記也？	釋妨難者，論云「彼聲聞等為實成佛故與記別，為不成佛與授記也？	As for resolving doubts, the treatise says: Are those śrāvakas and others really becoming buddhas and thus receiving the prediction, or are they receiving the prediction without becoming buddhas?
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0741c29_8']	若實成佛者，菩薩何故於無量劫修集無量功德？	若實成佛者，菩薩何故於無量劫修集無量功德？	If it is truly becoming a buddha, why did the bodhisattvas cultivate immeasurable merits for immeasurable eons?
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a01_3']	若不成佛者，云何虛妄授記？	若不成佛者，云何虛妄授記？	If it is not becoming a buddha, why give false predictions?
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a01_9']	」此意難言。	」此意難言。	This intention raises the difficulty, saying:
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a04_11']	若聲聞等但住百劫等練根修聲聞行，即實得成佛而與記者，菩薩何故於無量劫修集無量功德方得成佛菩提，少因已能實成佛故。	若聲聞等但住百劫等練根修聲聞行，即實得成佛而與記者，菩薩何故於無量劫修集無量功德方得成佛菩提，少因已能實成佛故。	If the śrāvakas and others only abide for a hundred eons and so forth, train their faculties, and cultivate the practices of the śrāvakas, and then truly attain buddhahood and are given predictions, why did the bodhisattvas cultivate immeasurable merits for immeasurable eons before attaining buddhahood and enlightenment? Because a small cause can already truly become a buddha.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a05_15']	若聲聞等雖修少因不得成者，何須今者虛妄記耶？	若聲聞等雖修少因不得成者，何須今者虛妄記耶？	If the śrāvakas and others do not attain buddhahood even though they cultivate a small cause, why is it necessary to give false predictions now?
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a09_5']	論自答言「彼聲聞授記者，得決定心，非成就法性故」，此意說言，令聲聞等得決定成佛心進修妙行，非已證會成就二空法性真理而與授記。	論自答言「彼聲聞授記者，得決定心，非成就法性故」，此意說言，令聲聞等得決定成佛心進修妙行，非已證會成就二空法性真理而與授記。	The treatise itself answers, The predictions given to those śrāvakas are to make them attain a determined mind, not because they have accomplished the nature of dharmas. This means that it is to enable the śrāvakas and others to attain the mind of definitely becoming a buddha and to cultivate wonderful practices, not because they have already realized and accomplished the true nature of dharmas, the principle of the two emptinesses, and are thus given predictions.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a12_1']	論又解云「如來依三乘平等說一乘法，以如來法身與彼聲聞法身無異故與授記，非即具足修行功德故與授記。	論又解云「如來依三乘平等說一乘法，以如來法身與彼聲聞法身無異故與授記，非即具足修行功德故與授記。	Another interpretation in the treatise says, The Tathāgata, relying on the equality of the three vehicles, preaches the Dharma of the One Vehicle. Because the Dharma body of the Tathāgata is no different from the Dharma body of those śrāvakas, he gives them predictions. It is not because they are fully endowed with the merits of practice that he gives them predictions.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a15_7']	十地菩薩成就法故功德具足，諸聲聞人功德未具足故，是以菩薩修無量行方得菩提，聲聞未修無量功德，但令得定成佛之心故與授記」。	十地菩薩成就法故功德具足，諸聲聞人功德未具足故，是以菩薩修無量行方得菩提，聲聞未修無量功德，但令得定成佛之心故與授記」。	Because bodhisattvas on the ten grounds have accomplished the Dharma, their merits are complete. Because the merits of śrāvaka persons are not yet complete, therefore bodhisattvas cultivate immeasurable practices in order to attain bodhi. Śrāvakas have not yet cultivated immeasurable merits, but only attain the mind of definite buddhahood, and therefore are given predictions.

['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a17_15']	《顯揚論》說「依變化身非業果身」，故不違理。	《顯揚論》說「依變化身非業果身」，故不違理。	The *Vyākhyā-vyākhā-śāstra says, Relying on the transformation body, not the body that is the result of karma. Therefore it does not contradict reason.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a21_12']	《成唯識》說「即是變易生死別名」，此意說言，未發心前現身有限，由受記後發大誓願求大菩提度有情類，便入邊際無漏勝定，資昔所作感今身業，令其長時與果不絕。	《成唯識》說「即是變易生死別名」，此意說言，未發心前現身有限，由受記後發大誓願求大菩提度有情類，便入邊際無漏勝定，資昔所作感今身業，令其長時與果不絕。	The Cheng weishi lun says, “This is a different name for the transmutation of life and death.” The meaning of this is that prior to the arousal of the thought of enlightenment, the present body is limited. However, after receiving a prediction, one makes a great vow seeking great bodhi and saving the various kinds of sentient beings. One then enters the ultimate pure and wondrous samādhi, and one’s past actions that produced the present body are nourished so that they continue to produce results for a long time without ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a27_2']	此所資業，由無漏資，展轉微妙舊麁異熟，已後微細廣大殊妙異於本故，猶如變化，由此變易異於舊時名變易生死，數數資長乃至成佛，由彼分段生死雖皆永盡，說過三百由旬化作一城，變易未盡說更二百由旬方至寶所故。	此所資業，由無漏資，展轉微妙舊麁異熟，已後微細廣大殊妙異於本故，猶如變化，由此變易異於舊時名變易生死，數數資長乃至成佛，由彼分段生死雖皆永盡，說過三百由旬化作一城，變易未盡說更二百由旬方至寶所故。	The actions that are nourished by the pure and wondrous samādhi are gradually subtle and wonderful, and the old coarse retribution is later subtle, vast, and wondrously different from the original. It is like a transformation. Because of this, the transmutation is different from the old time, and it is called the transmutation of life and death. It is nourished and extended until one becomes a Buddha. Because although the life and death of the compounded body is completely ended, it is said that after passing three hundred yojanas, one creates a city. The transmutation is not yet ended, and it is said that after two hundred yojanas one will reach the treasure site.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742a28_11']	分段生死雖皆永盡，受變易生乃至作佛，趣寂聲聞便無此事。	分段生死雖皆永盡，受變易生乃至作佛，趣寂聲聞便無此事。	Although they have completely ended the births and deaths of the transformation body, they still undergo the changes of the transformation body and become Buddhas. The Śrāvakas who enter quiescence do not have this matter.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742b01_10']	故《勝鬘》云「無明住地為緣、無漏業為因，有阿羅漢、辟支佛、大力菩薩三種意生身生。	故《勝鬘》云「無明住地為緣、無漏業為因，有阿羅漢、辟支佛、大力菩薩三種意生身生。	Therefore the Śrīmālā-sūtra says: The ground of nescience is the condition, and pure karma is the cause. There are three kinds of mind-born bodies for Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, and powerful Bodhisattvas.

He does not give predictions to those who are determined and those with excessive pride, because their faculties are not yet mature.
['ZH_T34_1723_05a:0742b06_17']	菩薩與記，菩薩與記者方便令發心故，常不輕記是。	菩薩與記，菩薩與記者方便令發心故，常不輕記是。	Bodhisattvas give predictions. When Bodhisattvas give predictions, it is because they skillfully cause them to give rise to the resolve. The prediction of always looking down upon is an example of this.
