['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a17_13']	稱近事發戒，　　說如苾芻等。	稱近事發戒，　　說如苾芻等。	It is said that the precepts of the lay devotee are taken up by declaring oneself to be so, just like the precepts of the fully ordained monk, etc.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a19_10']	起慇淨心發誠諦語，自稱我是鄔波索迦，願尊憶持慈悲護念。	起慇淨心發誠諦語，自稱我是鄔波索迦，願尊憶持慈悲護念。	One should arouse a sincere and pure mind, make a sincere statement, and declare oneself to be an upāsaka, saying, May the Venerable one remember me and compassionately protect me.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a21_9']	爾時乃發近事律儀，稱近事等言方發律儀故，以經復說我從今者乃至命終護生言故。	爾時乃發近事律儀，稱近事等言方發律儀故，以經復說我從今者乃至命終護生言故。	At that time, one gives rise to the precepts of the lay devotee. Because the precepts are taken up by declaring oneself to be a lay devotee, etc. It is because the sūtra further states, From now until the end of life, I will protect life.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a22_17']	若離稱號但受三歸成近事者，自稱我是近事等言便為無用。	若離稱號但受三歸成近事者，自稱我是近事等言便為無用。	If one becomes a lay devotee by taking the Three Refuges without declaring oneself to be so, then the statement I am a lay devotee would be useless.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a23_7']	依何義故說護生言？	依何義故說護生言？	In what sense is it said that one protects life?
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a23_16']	別解律儀護生得故。	別解律儀護生得故。	Because the precepts of individual liberation are obtained by protecting life.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a24_15']	或為救護自生命緣，亦不毀犯如來禁戒。	或為救護自生命緣，亦不毀犯如來禁戒。	Or, in order to save one's own life, one also does not violate the precepts of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a26_13']	諸異生類將受律儀，亦有如斯堅固意樂，乃至為救自生命緣，終不虧違所受學處。	諸異生類將受律儀，亦有如斯堅固意樂，乃至為救自生命緣，終不虧違所受學處。	Ordinary beings who are about to receive the precepts also have such a firm intention, and even to save their own lives, they will never violate the precepts they have received.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a27_3']	如斯誓受，世現可得。	如斯誓受，世現可得。	Such a vow can be found in the world.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869a27_13']	然有別誦，言捨生者。	然有別誦，言捨生者。	However, there is a separate recitation that says to abandon taking life.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b01_8']	彼雖已得近事律儀，為令了知所應學處，故復為說離殺生等五種戒相令識堅持。	彼雖已得近事律儀，為令了知所應學處，故復為說離殺生等五種戒相令識堅持。	Although they have already obtained the precepts of the lay follower, in order to make them understand the precepts they should learn, they again explain the five aspects of the precepts such as abandoning taking life, causing them to recognize and uphold them diligently.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b02_17']	如得苾芻具足戒已，說重學處令識堅持，勤策亦然，此亦應爾。	如得苾芻具足戒已，說重學處令識堅持，勤策亦然，此亦應爾。	Just as after a bhikṣu has obtained the complete precepts, the heavy precepts are explained, causing them to recognize and uphold them diligently. The same is so for the śrāmaṇera. This should also be so.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b03_15']	是故近事必具律儀，非受三歸即成近事。	是故近事必具律儀，非受三歸即成近事。	Therefore, the lay follower must possess the precepts. It is not the case that by taking refuge one immediately becomes a lay follower.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b09_3']	若諸近事皆具律儀，何緣世尊言有四種，一能學一分、二能學少分、三能學多分、四能學滿分。	若諸近事皆具律儀，何緣世尊言有四種，一能學一分、二能學少分、三能學多分、四能學滿分。	If all lay followers are fully endowed with the precepts, why did the World-Honored One say there are four kinds: those who can learn one part, those who can learn a small part, those who can learn a large part, and those who can learn the full part?
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b10_2']	豈不由此且已證成，非唯三歸即成近事。	豈不由此且已證成，非唯三歸即成近事。	How is it not already proven by this that one does not become a lay follower merely by taking the Three Refuges?
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b11_18']	謂若別有但受三歸即成近事，如是近事非前所說四種所收，應更說有第五近事。	謂若別有但受三歸即成近事，如是近事非前所說四種所收，應更說有第五近事。	If there is a separate [category] where one becomes a lay follower by simply taking the Three Refuges, then such a lay follower is not included in the previously mentioned four kinds, and one should speak of a fifth kind of lay follower.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b12_17']	此於學處全無所學，亦應說為一近事故。	此於學處全無所學，亦應說為一近事故。	This [fifth kind] has nothing to learn in the precepts, and one should also speak of it as a single lay follower.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b13_16']	佛觀近事非離律儀，故契經中唯說四種。	佛觀近事非離律儀，故契經中唯說四種。	The Buddha observed that a lay follower is not separate from the precepts, and therefore the sutras only speak of four kinds.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b14_16']	雖諸近事皆具律儀，然約能持故說四種。	雖諸近事皆具律儀，然約能持故說四種。	Although all lay followers are fully endowed with the precepts, they are still spoken of as four kinds based on their ability to uphold [the precepts].
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b17_4']	謂雖具受五支律儀，而後遇緣或便毀缺，其中或有於諸學處能持一分，乃至或有具持五支，故作是說：	謂雖具受五支律儀，而後遇緣或便毀缺，其中或有於諸學處能持一分，乃至或有具持五支，故作是說：	That is, although one may fully receive the five-part discipline, later encountering conditions one may then violate or break it. Among them, some may be able to uphold one part of the precepts, up to some who fully uphold the five parts. Therefore, it is said:
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b17_16']	能持先所受，故說能學言。	能持先所受，故說能學言。	Because one can uphold what was previously received, it is said that one can study.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b18_14']	不爾，應言受一分等，故此四種但據能持。	不爾，應言受一分等，故此四種但據能持。	Otherwise, one should say upholding one part and so on. Therefore, these four kinds are based only on what can be upheld.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b22_14']	由彼未解近事律儀受量少多，故應請問：	由彼未解近事律儀受量少多，故應請問：	Because they have not yet understood the amount of receiving the discipline of the lay follower, they should ask:
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b23_8']	凡有幾種鄔波索迦能學學處？	凡有幾種鄔波索迦能學學處？	How many kinds of upāsakas are there who can study the precepts?

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869b24_9']	有四鄔波索迦，謂能學一分等猶未能了。	有四鄔波索迦，謂能學一分等猶未能了。	There are four kinds of upāsakas, namely those who can study one part and so on. They still do not understand.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869c03_17']	答學一分等，豈除本所疑？	答學一分等，豈除本所疑？	The answer is training in one part and so on. How could this remove the original doubt?
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869c04_7']	故彼義中不應問答。	故彼義中不應問答。	Therefore, in their meaning, questions and answers should not be asked.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869c09_12']	此率己情，無經說故。	此率己情，無經說故。	This is based on one's own feelings, because there is no sūtra that says so.

Their views should be the same as those of the non-Buddhists such as Pūraṇa, not the tenets of the Buddha's teachings. All disciplines are of various kinds, not of the same kind, because there are three grades.

Taking refuge in this can accomplish the non-learner dharmas of the Buddha.
['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869c24_3']	言謂若者，即是總摽當所說義。	言謂若者，即是總摽當所說義。	The word if is a general indication of the meaning to be explained.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869c27_5']	想等想等是名差別。	想等想等是名差別。	Conceptualization and so on are different names.

['ZH_T29_1563_020:0869c29_3']	或此圓成智等眾德自然開覺，故名佛陀。	或此圓成智等眾德自然開覺，故名佛陀。	Alternatively, this perfect wisdom and other virtues naturally open to awareness, and so it is called buddha.

Consequently, the precepts of later buddhas are fewer than those of earlier buddhas. However, the precepts are not lost or obtained because the object that is able or unable to induce them changes. This is because the precepts are not generated separately with regard to each sentient being.
