['ZH_T14_0489_013:0738b19_17']	謂若菩薩見諸有情受苦惱者善根微少，為欲攝受令其具足諸善根故，而行乞食。	謂若菩薩見諸有情受苦惱者善根微少，為欲攝受令其具足諸善根故，而行乞食。	It means that if bodhisattvas see sentient beings suffering with little wholesome roots, in order to accept and cause them to be replete with wholesome roots, they practice begging for food.
['ZH_T14_0489_013:0738b22_5']	菩薩若入城邑聚落行乞食時，當住正念端直其身，進止可觀威儀有則，諸根寂靜如理瞻視繫念善法。	菩薩若入城邑聚落行乞食時，當住正念端直其身，進止可觀威儀有則，諸根寂靜如理瞻視繫念善法。	When bodhisattvas enter cities, towns, and villages to practice begging for food, they should abide in right mindfulness, be upright in body, dignified in movement and stillness, with proper deportment, their faculties tranquil, looking properly ahead, their thoughts focused on wholesome dharmas.

That is to say, in the houses of brahmins, kṣatriyas, elders, householders, and great clans, going from one to the next, begging in sequence, obtaining food and drink, knowing the proper amount and being content, only excluding special cases, not going everywhere.
['ZH_T14_0489_013:0738b28_14']	謂異處者——惡犬畜家及有新生犢子之舍，破壞淨戒，墮畜生中，能起嬈亂之者，若男、若女、童男、童女共所嫌棄，如是等處皆悉遠離。	謂異處者——惡犬畜家及有新生犢子之舍，破壞淨戒，墮畜生中，能起嬈亂之者，若男、若女、童男、童女共所嫌棄，如是等處皆悉遠離。	As for 'different places,' it means the homes of vicious dogs and livestock, and the houses of those who have newly given birth to calves. One who destroys pure precepts and falls into the animal realm, who is able to cause disturbance, whether male or female, boy or girl, is despised by all. One should stay far away from such places.
['ZH_T14_0489_013:0738c01_12']	「由其次第行乞食故，不生疲倦亦無譏毀，於彼有情不生染愛不起瞋恚，亦不厭棄。	「由其次第行乞食故，不生疲倦亦無譏毀，於彼有情不生染愛不起瞋恚，亦不厭棄。	 Because of sequentially begging for food, one does not become tired or reviled. One does not give rise to attachment or anger towards those beings, nor does one despise them.

Having accepted it, one returns to the monastery, puts away one's robes and alms bowl, washes one's hands and feet, makes offerings with respect and reverence in front of an image of the Tathāgata or a stūpa of the Tathāgata, and then enters one's own quarters to divide the alms food into four parts:
['ZH_T14_0489_013:0738c06_13']	一分授彼同梵行者、一分施於貧苦有情、一分當施墮惡趣者、一分自食。	一分授彼同梵行者、一分施於貧苦有情、一分當施墮惡趣者、一分自食。	 One part is given to fellow practitioners of the precepts, one part is given to poor and suffering beings, one part is given to those who have fallen into the evil destinies, and one part is eaten by oneself.

He accepts the food only to sustain his body, neither making it extremely emaciated nor extremely heavy.
['ZH_T14_0489_013:0738c09_5']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T14_0489_013:0738c10_3']	若極羸瘦妨修善法，若極沈重增長睡眠。	若極羸瘦妨修善法，若極沈重增長睡眠。	If it is extremely emaciated, it interferes with cultivating wholesome dharmas. If it is extremely heavy, it increases sleepiness.

Gradually he should cultivate and progress in the factors of enlightenment, causing them to be perfected. Because he cultivates and perfects the factors of enlightenment, he does not give rise to the grasping of self, and because he does not grasp at self, he is able to give his body and flesh to sentient beings.
