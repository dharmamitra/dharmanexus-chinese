The treatise says the first of the last three is called attaining the stage because it is a superior comparison.

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0307a04_5']	二得菩薩地盡校量勝故，此在第十地，菩薩位窮故云地盡；	二得菩薩地盡校量勝故，此在第十地，菩薩位窮故云地盡；	Second, attaining the culmination of the bodhisattva stages is due to the superiority of the comparison, which is in the tenth stage, because the position of the bodhisattva is exhausted;

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0307a09_11']	二地中起願，願當成佛，今亦未成；	二地中起願，願當成佛，今亦未成；	Second, in the stages one gives rise to vows, vowing to attain Buddhahood. Now, it is still not attained;
['ZH_T35_1733_011:0307a11_10']	或是果，以地前起願未成為因、得地成就為果，如十度行地前為因、地上為果等。	或是果，以地前起願未成為因、得地成就為果，如十度行地前為因、地上為果等。	Or it is the fruition, because in the stages prior to the stages one gives rise to vows that are not yet fulfilled as the cause, and upon attaining the stages one accomplishes them as the fruition, like the practices of the ten perfections, which are the cause in the stages prior to the stages and the fruition in the stages and above.

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0307c24_3']	此八相亦有化佛具不具者，如天王如來白衣成道則無出家，須扇多佛亦知出世無眾生可化即入涅槃，留化佛半劫度人，是則無轉法輪，若取化說亦得具八，餘釋迦等多亦具之。	此八相亦有化佛具不具者，如天王如來白衣成道則無出家，須扇多佛亦知出世無眾生可化即入涅槃，留化佛半劫度人，是則無轉法輪，若取化說亦得具八，餘釋迦等多亦具之。	As for these eight characteristics, there are also Buddhas of transformation who may or may not possess them. For example, the Tathāgata of the Heavenly King attained enlightenment as a layman and thus did not have the characteristic of going forth. The Buddha of the Sandalwood Tree also knew that there were no sentient beings to be transformed in the world and so immediately entered nirvāṇa, leaving a Buddha of transformation for half an eon to deliver people. This then lacks the characteristic of turning the wheel of the Dharma, but if one takes the transformation teaching, it also possesses the eight characteristics.

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0307c29_10']	餘三不爾故不解釋，以處胎必生故不待釋，出家勝俗故亦不釋，轉法益生亦勝不說故不釋之。	餘三不爾故不解釋，以處胎必生故不待釋，出家勝俗故亦不釋，轉法益生亦勝不說故不釋之。	The other three are not like this, so they are not explained. Because entering the womb necessarily gives birth, it does not need to be explained. Going forth is superior to the secular, so it is also not explained. Turning the wheel of the Dharma and benefiting beings is also superior and not spoken, so it is not explained.

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0312b22_18']	是故此文前三支一處釋者，以俱是能引故，為四流等潤彼業種，及五果種轉為有故，令其生果，是故前言起心意識種子。	是故此文前三支一處釋者，以俱是能引故，為四流等潤彼業種，及五果種轉為有故，令其生果，是故前言起心意識種子。	Therefore, the text explains the first three members together in one place, because they are all able to attract. They moisten those karmic seeds and the seeds of the five fruits, transforming them into existence, causing them to produce results. Therefore, the text previously said arising of the seeds of mind, mental consciousness, and mental activities.

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0312b29_1']	是故此中因相云名色，不離本識故。	是故此中因相云名色，不離本識故。	Therefore, in this context, the characteristic of cause is called name-and-form, because it is not separate from the fundamental consciousness.
['ZH_T35_1733_011:0312c01_11']	謂此共識所生名色生，已依於現行第八，為彼執持，故名因相。	謂此共識所生名色生，已依於現行第八，為彼執持，故名因相。	That is to say, this [name-and-form] is produced together with consciousness.

Therefore, it is called the characteristic of the sequence of their effects.

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0318a26_6']	」是故誑他之思心是妄語因，離此即實語成，實語即是謂離，故不別說。	」是故誑他之思心是妄語因，離此即實語成，實語即是謂離，故不別說。	Therefore, the thought of deceiving others is the cause of false speech. Apart from this, it becomes true speech. True speech is precisely the opposite, so it is not explained separately.

['ZH_T35_1733_011:0318b07_3']	又實不見前事，妄生見想，誑言不見，於事雖實，於見有違，故名忍見，此忍己見故。	又實不見前事，妄生見想，誑言不見，於事雖實，於見有違，故名忍見，此忍己見故。	Moreover, when one does not actually see the matter in front, one falsely gives rise to the thought of seeing, and falsely says one does not see. Although it is true regarding the matter, there is a contradiction regarding the seeing, and therefore it is called enduring what one has seen, because one endures one's own seeing.
