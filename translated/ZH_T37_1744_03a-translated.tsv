Although it is said that the four truths are taught for śrāvakas, the twelve links of dependent origination are taught for pratyekabuddhas, and the six pāramitās are taught for bodhisattvas, these teachings are only three.

Therefore, it is called a single cognition.

['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0067c11_18']	一生死即如來藏，故甚深。	一生死即如來藏，故甚深。	First, because birth and death are the Tathāgata's treasury, it is profound.

['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0067c14_14']	」二眾生身即法身，故甚深。	」二眾生身即法身，故甚深。	Second, because the body of sentient beings is the Dharma body, it is profound.

['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0067c21_5']	一則十地不能見，當體為甚深，此即是自性住佛性甚深；	一則十地不能見，當體為甚深，此即是自性住佛性甚深；	First, the ten grounds cannot see it. The essence itself is profound. This is the profound nature of the Buddha-nature that abides by itself;
['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0067c22_7']	二者佛性即是極滅，隱而未彰，須萬行了出。	二者佛性即是極滅，隱而未彰，須萬行了出。	Second, the Buddha-nature is the ultimate cessation, hidden and not yet manifested, requiring the completion of myriad practices to emerge.
['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0067c23_13']	所了既深，能了亦深，是則道諦甚深，謂引出佛性甚深也；	所了既深，能了亦深，是則道諦甚深，謂引出佛性甚深也；	Since what is understood is profound, the ability to understand is also profound. This is the profound truth of the path, referring to the profound nature of the Buddha-nature that is drawn out;
['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0067c26_5']	三者四諦俱深，謂苦集能覆甚深之藏，彰甚深之道，故苦集為深，如因緣之理皆性下墜，唯佛能見其始，故極深。	三者四諦俱深，謂苦集能覆甚深之藏，彰甚深之道，故苦集為深，如因緣之理皆性下墜，唯佛能見其始，故極深。	Third, the four truths are both profound and subtle, meaning that suffering and its causes can obscure the extremely profound treasury and manifest the extremely profound path, so suffering and its causes are profound. The principle of causes and conditions all naturally lead to decline, only the Buddha can see their beginning, so they are extremely profound.
['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0067c27_7']	斯則四諦俱深，原由佛性，故將明八諦，舉之致歎。	斯則四諦俱深，原由佛性，故將明八諦，舉之致歎。	This means that the four truths are both profound and subtle, and the reason is due to buddha-nature. Therefore, when about to explain the eight truths, it is mentioned to express admiration.

['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0068a01_3']	非世間修慧境界，故言「非思量」。	非世間修慧境界，故言「非思量」。	It is not the realm of the wisdom of cultivation in the world, so it is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T37_1744_03a:0068a02_11']	非報趣生識智境界，以是真證智境界，故言「是智者所知」。	非報趣生識智境界，以是真證智境界，故言「是智者所知」。	It is not the realm of the cognition of the consciousnesses of retribution, destiny, and birth, because it is the realm of the wisdom of true realization, so it is called known by the wise.
