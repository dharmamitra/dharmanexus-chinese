['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b10_3']	起永徽六年夏五月譯理門論終顯慶元年春三月　百官謝示御製寺碑文起永徽六年夏五月譯《理門論》終顯慶元年春三月　百官謝示御製寺碑文六年夏五月庚午，法師以正譯之餘，又譯《理門論》。	起永徽六年夏五月譯理門論終顯慶元年春三月　百官謝示御製寺碑文起永徽六年夏五月譯《理門論》終顯慶元年春三月　百官謝示御製寺碑文六年夏五月庚午，法師以正譯之餘，又譯《理門論》。	008	Starting from the summer of the fifth month in the sixth year of the Yong徽 era, when the translation of the Nyāyamukha was completed, to the third month of the spring in the first year of the Xian慶 era, when the officials expressed their gratitude for the imperial inscription of the monastery stele, starting from the summer of the fifth month in the sixth year of the Yong徽 era, when the translation of the Nyāyamukha was completed, to the third month of the spring in the first year of the Xian慶 era, when the officials expressed their gratitude for the imperial inscription of the monastery stele. In the sixth year, in the fifth month, on a day gengwu, the Dharma Master, in addition to the correct translation, also translated the Nyāyamukha.

The monks in the translation office competed in composing commentaries and glosses.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b14_8']	時譯經僧栖玄將其論示尚藥奉御呂才，才遂更張衢術，指其長短，作《因明註解立破義圖》，序曰：	時譯經僧栖玄將其論示尚藥奉御呂才，才遂更張衢術，指其長短，作《因明註解立破義圖》，序曰：	008	At that time, the monk Xuan, who was translating the scriptures, showed the treatise to Shang Yao, the Attendant-in-Ordinary, and Lu Cai. Cai then revised the path, pointing out its strengths and weaknesses, and wrote the Commentary on the Logic of Inference and Diagram of the Meaning of Establishing and Refuting, with a preface saying:
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b16_5']	「蓋聞一消一息，範圍天地之儀，大哉至哉，變通爻畫之紀。	「蓋聞一消一息，範圍天地之儀，大哉至哉，變通爻畫之紀。	008	I have heard that the one dissolution and one breath encompass the pattern of heaven and earth, and the great and sublime record the changes and movements of the trigrams.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b17_3']	理則未弘於方外，事乃猶拘於域中。	理則未弘於方外，事乃猶拘於域中。	008	The principle has not yet been widely spread outside the square, and the matter is still confined within the realm.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b17_17']	推渾元而莫知，窮陰陽而不測。	推渾元而莫知，窮陰陽而不測。	008	Pushing the primordial chaos, one does not know it, exhausting the yin and yang, one cannot fathom it.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b19_7']	豈聞象繫之表，猶開八正之門，形器之先，更弘二智之教者也。	豈聞象繫之表，猶開八正之門，形器之先，更弘二智之教者也。	008	How could it be heard that beyond the diagrams, it still opens the gate of the eight right paths, and before the formation of the physical vessel, it further spreads the teaching of the two knowledges?
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b21_2']	故能運空有而雙照，冥真俗而兩夷，泛六度於愛河，駕三車於火宅。	故能運空有而雙照，冥真俗而兩夷，泛六度於愛河，駕三車於火宅。	008	Therefore, it can operate emptiness and existence to illuminate both, obscure truth and convention to level both, sail the six pāramitās in the river of desire, and drive the three carts out of the burning house.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b23_14']	是知法王法力，超群生而自在，自覺覺人，摧眾魔而獨悟，業運將啟，乃雷震而電耀，化緣斯極，亦火滅而薪盡。	是知法王法力，超群生而自在，自覺覺人，摧眾魔而獨悟，業運將啟，乃雷震而電耀，化緣斯極，亦火滅而薪盡。	008	Thus, we know that the Dharma King's Dharma power surpasses all beings and is self-mastery. He awakens himself and awakens others, subduing all demons and attaining enlightenment alone. When the wheel of karma is about to turn, it thunders and flashes. When the conditions for transformation are exhausted, it is like a fire going out when the firewood is finished.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b24_14']	觀其應迹，若有去來，察此真常，本無生住。	觀其應迹，若有去來，察此真常，本無生住。	008	Observing his responsive traces, it seems there is coming and going. Examining this true permanence, there is originally no birth or abiding.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262b27_6']	但以弘濟之道，有緣斯應，天祚明德，無遠不臻，是以萌蔕疇昔，神光聊見於曩時，祥瑞有歸，淨土咸款於茲日。	但以弘濟之道，有緣斯應，天祚明德，無遠不臻，是以萌蔕疇昔，神光聊見於曩時，祥瑞有歸，淨土咸款於茲日。	008	But the way of vast salvation responds to those with conditions. The heavenly blessings and bright virtues reach everywhere without exception. Therefore, the seeds from the past, the divine light, are briefly seen in the past, and the auspicious signs return, with the Pure Land all welcoming on this day.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c01_18']	伏惟　皇唐之有天下也，運金輪而臨四有，握󱈜極而撫萬方，耀慧日於六天，蒸法雲於十地，西越流沙，遂荒妙樂之域，東漸於海，掩有歡喜之都。	伏惟　皇唐之有天下也，運金輪而臨四有，握󱈜極而撫萬方，耀慧日於六天，蒸法雲於十地，西越流沙，遂荒妙樂之域，東漸於海，掩有歡喜之都。	008	I humbly think that since the Tang Dynasty has ruled the world, turning the golden wheel and overseeing the four realms, holding the ultimate and governing the myriad directions, shining the sun of wisdom in the six heavens, and steaming the clouds of Dharma in the ten grounds, going west across the flowing sands, reaching the vast and wondrous joyful realm, and gradually spreading east to the sea, covering the capital of joyful acceptance.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c04_2']	振聲教於無邊，通車書於有頂，遂使百億須彌既咸頒於望祑，三千法界亦共沐於皇風。	振聲教於無邊，通車書於有頂，遂使百億須彌既咸頒於望祑，三千法界亦共沐於皇風。	008	The sound of the teachings resounds infinitely, and the scriptures are transmitted to the summit of existence, causing the hundred koṭīs of Mount Sumeru to all receive the imperial edict, and the three thousand dharma realms to equally bathe in the imperial atmosphere.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c05_8']	故令五方印度改荒服於󱡐街，十八韋陀譯梵文於祕府。	故令五方印度改荒服於󱡐街，十八韋陀譯梵文於祕府。	008	Thus, the five directions of India changed their wilderness attire to the streets of Chang'an, and the eighteen Vedas translated the Sanskrit texts into the secret repository.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c06_8']	乃有三藏玄奘法師者，所謂當今之能仁也。	乃有三藏玄奘法師者，所謂當今之能仁也。	008	There is the Tripiṭaka master Xuanzang, who is called the Śākyamuni of today.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c08_4']	聰慧夙成，該覽宏贍，德行純粹，律業翹勤，實三寶之棟梁，四眾之綱紀者也。	聰慧夙成，該覽宏贍，德行純粹，律業翹勤，實三寶之棟梁，四眾之綱紀者也。	008	His wisdom is naturally accomplished, his learning is vast and comprehensive, his virtue and conduct are pure, and he diligently practices the precepts. He is truly the pillar of the Three Jewels and the leader of the four assemblies.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c11_3']	每以釋教東遷，為日已久，或恐邪正雜擾，水乳不分，若不稽實相於迦維，驗真文於摩竭，何以成決定之藏，為畢竟之宗者乎。	每以釋教東遷，為日已久，或恐邪正雜擾，水乳不分，若不稽實相於迦維，驗真文於摩竭，何以成決定之藏，為畢竟之宗者乎。	008	He always thought that since the transmission of the Buddha's teachings to the East has been a long time, he was afraid that the true and false teachings might be mixed up, and the water and milk might not be distinguished. If he did not investigate the true characteristics in Kapilavastu and examine the true texts in Magadha, how could he establish a definitive treasury and make it the ultimate teaching?
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c13_13']	幸逢二儀交泰，四海無塵，遂得拂衣玄漠，振錫葱嶺，不由味於𮑄醬，直路夷通，豈藉佩於杜衡，遙途近易。	幸逢二儀交泰，四海無塵，遂得拂衣玄漠，振錫葱嶺，不由味於𮑄醬，直路夷通，豈藉佩於杜衡，遙途近易。	008	Fortunately, I encountered the two polarities in harmony and the four seas without dust, so I was able to brush off my clothes in the mysterious desert and shake my staff at the Onion Range. I did not need to taste the delicacies, as the straight road was open and unobstructed. How could I need to rely on the compass to guide me? The distant journey was made easy.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c15_5']	於是窮河源於西域，涉恒水於東維，採貝葉於鷲山，窺金文於鶴樹。	於是窮河源於西域，涉恒水於東維，採貝葉於鷲山，窺金文於鶴樹。	008	Thus, I reached the source of the Yellow River in the Western Regions and crossed the Ganges River in the Eastern Continent. I collected the palm leaves on Vulture Peak and peered at the golden text on Crane Tree.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c17_9']	所歷諸國百有餘都，所獲經論向七百部，並傳以藩馹，聿歸上京，因得面奉聖顏，對揚宗極。	所歷諸國百有餘都，所獲經論向七百部，並傳以藩馹，聿歸上京，因得面奉聖顏，對揚宗極。	008	I passed through more than a hundred countries and obtained nearly seven hundred scriptures and treatises. I transmitted them with the horses of the borderlands and returned to the capital. I was able to meet the sage's countenance and proclaim the ultimate teaching.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c18_11']	此《因明論》者，即是三藏所獲梵本之內之一部也。	此《因明論》者，即是三藏所獲梵本之內之一部也。	008	This Hetuvidya Sastra is one of the Sanskrit texts obtained by the Tripiṭaka Master.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c21_1']	理則包括於三乘，事乃牢籠於百法，研機空有之際，發揮內外之宗，雖詞約而理弘，實文微而義顯。	理則包括於三乘，事乃牢籠於百法，研機空有之際，發揮內外之宗，雖詞約而理弘，實文微而義顯。	008	In principle, it includes the Three Vehicles, and in practice, it encompasses the Hundred Dharmas. It investigates the realm of emptiness and existence, and elucidates the teachings of Buddhism and non-Buddhism. Although the words are concise, the principles are vast. The text is subtle, but the meaning is evident.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c22_6']	學之者當生不能窺其奧，游之者數載未足測其源。	學之者當生不能窺其奧，游之者數載未足測其源。	008	Those who study it cannot fathom its depths even if they are born into it, and those who practice it for several years are not yet able to fathom its source.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c23_2']	以其眾妙之門，是以先事翻譯。	以其眾妙之門，是以先事翻譯。	008	Because it is the gateway to myriad wonders, I have thus first engaged in translation.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c26_6']	其有神泰法師、靖邁法師、明覺法師等，並以神機昭晣，志業兼該，博習群經，多所通悟，皆蒙別　勅，追赴法筵，遂得函丈請益，執卷承旨。	其有神泰法師、靖邁法師、明覺法師等，並以神機昭晣，志業兼該，博習群經，多所通悟，皆蒙別　勅，追赴法筵，遂得函丈請益，執卷承旨。	008	As for Dharma Masters Shentai, Jingmai, Mingjue, and others, they are all brilliant in spiritual capacity, with aspirations and accomplishments encompassing both, widely studying numerous sūtras, and having much understanding. They have all been specially ordered to attend the Dharma assembly, and thus have been able to request teachings from the abbot and receive instructions while holding the sūtra.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c27_15']	三藏既善宣法要，妙盡幽深，泰法師等是以各錄所聞，為之義疏。	三藏既善宣法要，妙盡幽深，泰法師等是以各錄所聞，為之義疏。	008	Since the Tripiṭaka master is skilled in expounding the essential teachings, marvelously exhausting the profound, Dharma Masters such as Shentai have thus each recorded what they have heard and composed commentaries on the meaning.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c28_16']	詮表既定，方擬流通，無緣之徒多未聞見。	詮表既定，方擬流通，無緣之徒多未聞見。	008	Once the explanations and illustrations are established, they are ready to be circulated, but those without the conditions have mostly not heard or seen them.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0262c29_15']	復有栖玄法師者，乃是才之幼少之舊也。	復有栖玄法師者，乃是才之幼少之舊也。	008	There is also Dharma Master Xixuan, who is a childhood friend of Cai.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a02_5']	昔栖遁於嵩岳，嘗抂步於山門，既筮仕於上京，猶曲睠於窮巷。	昔栖遁於嵩岳，嘗抂步於山門，既筮仕於上京，猶曲睠於窮巷。	008	In the past, when Xixuan was secluded on Mount Song, he once took a walk in the monastery gate. Having already served in the capital, he still looked out for his friend in the poor alleys.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a03_6']	自蒙修攝，三十餘年，切思之誠，二難俱盡。	自蒙修攝，三十餘年，切思之誠，二難俱盡。	008	I have been under your guidance for over thirty years, and my sincerity in thinking of you has exhausted both difficulties.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a04_14']	然法師節操精潔，戒行氷霜，學既照達於一乘，身乃拘局於十誦。	然法師節操精潔，戒行氷霜，學既照達於一乘，身乃拘局於十誦。	008	However, the Dharma Master's character is pure and clean, his precepts are like ice and frost, his learning is illuminating and penetrating in the One Vehicle, but his body is constrained by the Ten Recitations.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a05_11']	才既覩其清苦，時以開遮拆之。	才既覩其清苦，時以開遮拆之。	008	When I saw his austerity, I often used the method of opening and closing to break through it.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a06_14']	但以內外不同，行已各異，言戲之間，是非鋒起。	但以內外不同，行已各異，言戲之間，是非鋒起。	008	But because the inner and outer are different, the practices are already distinct, and when speaking playfully, the sharpness of right and wrong arises.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a07_2']	師乃從容謂才曰：	師乃從容謂才曰：	008	The teacher then said to me in a relaxed manner:
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a08_13']	『檀越復研味於六經，探賾於百氏，推陰陽之愆伏，察律呂之忽微。	『檀越復研味於六經，探賾於百氏，推陰陽之愆伏，察律呂之忽微。	008	'The patron has also savored the Six Classics and explored the hundred schools of thought, pushing the errors of yin and yang, observing the subtle changes in the lü and lü.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a10_8']	又聞生平未見《太玄》，詔問須臾即解，由來不窺象戲，試造旬日復成。	又聞生平未見《太玄》，詔問須臾即解，由來不窺象戲，試造旬日復成。	008	I also heard that in your whole life you have never seen the Tai Xuan, but when asked about it, you immediately understood. You have never looked at the game of chess, but when you tried to create it in a few days, you succeeded again.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a13_7']	以此有限之心，逢事即欲穿鑿，但以佛法玄妙量，謂未與彼同，雖復強學推尋，恐非措心之所，何因今將內論翻用見譏者乎？	以此有限之心，逢事即欲穿鑿，但以佛法玄妙量，謂未與彼同，雖復強學推尋，恐非措心之所，何因今將內論翻用見譏者乎？	008	Using this limited mind, whenever encountering a matter, one immediately wants to penetrate it. But considering the profundity of the Buddha Dharma, one thinks it is not the same as that. Although one may forcefully study and investigate, I fear it is not within the scope of the mind. For what reason would I now use the internal treatises to be criticized?
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a14_15']	』法師後逢《因明》創行，義趣幽隱，是以先寫一通，故將見遺。	』法師後逢《因明》創行，義趣幽隱，是以先寫一通，故將見遺。	008	Later, the Dharma Master encountered the newly circulated Nyāyapraveśa, whose meaning was profound and hidden. Therefore, he first copied a copy and sent it to me.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a15_1']	仍附書云：	仍附書云：	008	He also attached a letter saying:
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a17_2']	『此論極難，深究玄妙，比有聰明博識，聽之多不能解，今若復能通之，可謂內外俱悉矣。	『此論極難，深究玄妙，比有聰明博識，聽之多不能解，今若復能通之，可謂內外俱悉矣。	008	This treatise is extremely difficult and deeply profound. Recently, there have been many intelligent and knowledgeable people who, upon hearing it, are unable to understand it. If you can now comprehend it, you can be said to be well-versed in both internal and external matters.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a18_12']	』其論既近至中夏，才實未之前聞，恥於被試不知，復為強加披閱。	』其論既近至中夏，才實未之前聞，恥於被試不知，復為強加披閱。	008	Since the treatise had just arrived in China, I had not heard of it before. I was ashamed of being tested and not knowing it, so I forcefully read it again.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a20_6']	於是依極成而探深義，憑比量而求微旨，反覆再三，薄識宗趣。	於是依極成而探深義，憑比量而求微旨，反覆再三，薄識宗趣。	008	Then, relying on the well-established [reasoning] to explore the profound meaning, and using the inferential cognition to seek the subtle purport, I repeatedly examined it three times, and had a rough understanding of the main points.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a22_18']	後復借得諸法師等三家義疏，更加究習，然以諸法師等雖復序致泉富，文理會通，既以執見參差，所說自相矛楯。	後復借得諸法師等三家義疏，更加究習，然以諸法師等雖復序致泉富，文理會通，既以執見參差，所說自相矛楯。	008	Later, he borrowed the commentaries of three Dharma masters and studied them further. However, although the Dharma masters had abundant explanations and connected the text and principles, they had different views and contradicted each other in their explanations.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a24_9']	義既同稟三藏，豈合更開二門，但由釁發蕭牆，故容外侮𨶳測。	義既同稟三藏，豈合更開二門，但由釁發蕭牆，故容外侮𨶳測。	008	Since they all received the Tripiṭaka, how could they open two more gates? But because the fault arose from the low wall, it allowed external insults to intrude.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a26_1']	然佛以一音演說，亦許隨類各解，何必獨簡白衣，不為眾生之例？	然佛以一音演說，亦許隨類各解，何必獨簡白衣，不為眾生之例？	008	However, the Buddha expounded with one voice and also allowed understanding according to one's kind. Why must it be exclusively limited to laypeople, not being an example for sentient beings?
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263a28_20']	才以公務之餘輒為斯注，至於三法師等所說，善者因而成之，其有疑者，立而破之，分為上、中、下三卷，號曰《立破注解》。	才以公務之餘輒為斯注，至於三法師等所說，善者因而成之，其有疑者，立而破之，分為上、中、下三卷，號曰《立破注解》。	008	I, Cai, casually wrote this commentary in my spare time from official duties. As for the explanations of the three Dharma masters, I followed and perfected the good ones, and for the doubtful ones, I refuted them, dividing them into three scrolls: upper, middle, and lower, called Commentary on Establishing and Refuting.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263b03_3']	其間墨書者即是論之本文，其朱書注者以存師等舊說，其下墨書注者，是才今之新撰，用決師等前義，凡有四十餘條，自鄶已下，猶未具錄。	其間墨書者即是論之本文，其朱書注者以存師等舊說，其下墨書注者，是才今之新撰，用決師等前義，凡有四十餘條，自鄶已下，猶未具錄。	008	The black ink writing is the main text of the treatise, the red ink annotations preserve the old explanations of Shi and others, the black ink annotations below are newly composed by Cai to resolve Shi and others' previous meanings, totaling over forty sections, which have not yet been fully recorded from the end of the chapter.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263b05_4']	至於文理隱伏稍難見者，仍畫為《義圖》，共相比挍，仍更別撰一方丈圖，獨存才之近注。	至於文理隱伏稍難見者，仍畫為《義圖》，共相比挍，仍更別撰一方丈圖，獨存才之近注。	008	As for the hidden and difficult to see points in the text and principles, I have drawn up a Diagram of Meanings to compare them together, and I have also separately composed a square diagram to solely preserve Cai's recent annotations.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263b06_13']	論既外無人解，無處道聽途說，若言生而知之，固非才之望也。	論既外無人解，無處道聽途說，若言生而知之，固非才之望也。	008	Since no one else understands the treatise, there is no place for hearsay, if it is said to be innate knowledge, it is certainly not what Cai hopes for.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263b07_17']	然以學無再請，尚曰傳燈，聞一知十，方稱殆庶。	然以學無再請，尚曰傳燈，聞一知十，方稱殆庶。	008	However, since learning cannot be requested twice, it is said to transmit the lamp, and only when hearing one thing and knowing ten is it considered almost possible.
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263b09_6']	況乎生平不見，率爾輒事含毫，今既不由師資，注解能無紕紊？	況乎生平不見，率爾輒事含毫，今既不由師資，注解能無紕紊？	008	How much more so for someone who has never seen it in their whole life, yet rashly takes up the brush, now that it is not based on teacher-student relationships, how can the annotations be without errors?
['ZH_T50_2053_008:0263b11_12']	竊聞雪山夜叉說生滅法，丘井野獸嘆未曾有，苟令所言合理，尚得天仙歸敬，才之所注庶幾於茲。	竊聞雪山夜叉說生滅法，丘井野獸嘆未曾有，苟令所言合理，尚得天仙歸敬，才之所注庶幾於茲。	008	I have heard that the yakṣa of the Himalayas spoke of the Dharma of birth and cessation, and the wild beasts in the hills and valleys praised it as unprecedented. If what he said accords with reason, he can still obtain the reverence of celestial immortals. What I have noted here is perhaps like this.
