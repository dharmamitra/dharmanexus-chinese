['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a02_4']	故破義是齊而小異者。	故破義是齊而小異者。	Therefore, the meaning of refutation is equivalent, but slightly different.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a02_16']	大有一體異體唯外道所執。	大有一體異體唯外道所執。	The great existence being the same substance or different substances is only grasped by non-Buddhists.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a09_3']	中論破內學。	中論破內學。	The Middle Treatise destroys internal learning.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a09_16']	內學大小乘人但明不到能見。	內學大小乘人但明不到能見。	Internal learners of the Mahayana and Hinayana only clarify that the mind that does not reach can see.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a10_5']	故中論直破其見。	故中論直破其見。	Therefore, the Middle Treatise directly destroys its views.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a10_14']	外道具執到不到見。	外道具執到不到見。	External teachings both grasp the views of reaching and not reaching.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a12_16']	意識難解故但明五情及以於意。	意識難解故但明五情及以於意。	The thinking consciousness is difficult to understand, so it only clarifies the five feelings and the mind.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a13_10']	神御於意行眼等中故能見色。	神御於意行眼等中故能見色。	The spirit controls the mind and acts through the eyes and other senses, thus being able to see forms.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a14_10']	云何言意行眼門。	云何言意行眼門。	How can it be said that the mind acts through the eyes?
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a15_3']	答外道不明從意根生意識。	答外道不明從意根生意識。	Answer: The non-Buddhists do not understand that the mental consciousness arises from the mind faculty.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a15_15']	但言有心平等根名之為意。	但言有心平等根名之為意。	They only say that there is a mind that is the equal of the faculties, which is called the mind.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c15_20']	前破故釋上共。	前破故釋上共。	The previous refutation is therefore the explanation of the above common.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c16_16']	一者有無望共則為在前。	一者有無望共則為在前。	First, existence and non-existence are considered common in relation to the common.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c17_6']	故破有無名為破共。	故破有無名為破共。	Therefore, refuting existence and non-existence is called refuting the common.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c18_3']	二者依天親以初二偈本名之為共。	二者依天親以初二偈本名之為共。	Second, relying on Nāgârjuna's first two verses, it is called common.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c18_11']	初偈破前見後知。	初偈破前見後知。	The first verse refutes the previous seeing and the later knowing.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c18_18']	此是有見無知。	此是有見無知。	This is existence and seeing without knowing.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c19_6']	次偈破前知後見。	次偈破前知後見。	The next verse refutes the previous knowing and the later seeing.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c19_12']	是有知無見。	是有知無見。	This is existence and knowing without seeing.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c20_4']	前二既破有無則名破共。	前二既破有無則名破共。	Since the previous two have been refuted, existence and non-existence are then called refuting the common.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c20_9']	故云前破。	故云前破。	Therefore, it is said to be the previous refutation.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c21_1']	又偈本中明云有故無故。	又偈本中明云有故無故。	Moreover, in the verse it is stated that because there is, there is not.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c21_10']	此二即是二修妬路。	此二即是二修妬路。	These two are the two sutras.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c22_3']	還指此二故云二修妬路也。	還指此二故云二修妬路也。	It refers to these two, therefore it says the two sutras.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c22_8']	注中為二。	注中為二。	The commentary is divided into two parts.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c22_18']	前釋偈本次義破一時。	前釋偈本次義破一時。	First, it explains the verse and then refutes the simultaneous meaning.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c23_5']	所以明此二者。	所以明此二者。	The reason for clarifying these two is as follows.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c23_11']	外立一時生。	外立一時生。	The opponent establishes simultaneous arising.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c23_17']	偈本破其生。	偈本破其生。	The verse refutes its arising.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c24_5']	天親義破一時有。	天親義破一時有。	Nagarjuna's meaning refutes the simultaneity of existence.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c24_15']	初又三。	初又三。	The first is divided into three.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c24_18']	一牒。	一牒。	First, it cites.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c25_5']	於三中下次總非。	於三中下次總非。	Next, in the three, it generally refutes.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c25_12']	何故下三正破。	何故下三正破。	Why? The third correctly refutes.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c26_6']	復次若一時者第二義破一時。	復次若一時者第二義破一時。	Next, if it is simultaneous, the second meaning refutes simultaneity.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c26_11']	見則是因。	見則是因。	Seeing is the cause.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c26_16']	知名為果。	知名為果。	Knowing is called the effect.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c27_9']	若知見一時便為並失相待也。	若知見一時便為並失相待也。	If knowing and seeing are simultaneous, then there is a loss of mutual dependence.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c27_18']	復次眼為到色見耶。	復次眼為到色見耶。	Next, does the eye reach form to see it?

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281c29_2']	今第二次破其見亦開三門。	今第二次破其見亦開三門。	Now, the second refutes its seeing, also opening three gates.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0282a02_6']	並云眼是遙矚不到能見。	並云眼是遙矚不到能見。	They all say that the eye is able to see from afar without reaching.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0282a02_15']	僧佉亦云眼可懸矚。	僧佉亦云眼可懸矚。	Sāṃkhya also says that the eye can see from a distance.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0282a03_7']	所以眼見惡事即須避之。	所以眼見惡事即須避之。	The reason is that when the eye sees evil things, it must avoid them.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0282a04_9']	此與佛法全同。	此與佛法全同。	This is completely the same as the Buddha Dharma.
