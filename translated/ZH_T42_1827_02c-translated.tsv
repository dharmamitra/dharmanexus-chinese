['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a02_16']	大有一體異體唯外道所執。	大有一體異體唯外道所執。	02c	The great existence being the same substance or different substances is only grasped by non-Buddhists.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a03_2']	故餘處云。	故餘處云。	02c	Therefore, elsewhere it is said:
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a03_15']	外道大有經說此則破而不取。	外道大有經說此則破而不取。	02c	The scriptures of non-Buddhists on the great existence explain this, so it is refuted but not accepted.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a04_5']	若是情塵通於內外。	若是情塵通於內外。	02c	As for the objects of the mind, they are common to both internal and external.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a04_11']	故亦取亦破。	故亦取亦破。	02c	Therefore, they are both accepted and refuted.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a04_17']	若橫謂有者。	若橫謂有者。	02c	If one arbitrarily considers them to exist,
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a05_3']	則破而不取。	則破而不取。	02c	then they are refuted but not accepted.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a05_14']	因緣假名情塵取而不破。	因緣假名情塵取而不破。	02c	The provisional names of causes and conditions are grasped by the mind and objects, but they are not destroyed.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a07_4']	答中論但破於情不破知生義。	答中論但破於情不破知生義。	02c	Answer: The Middle Treatise only destroys the mind, but not the meaning of knowing arising.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a07_9']	今則具足。	今則具足。	02c	Now it is complete.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a08_3']	中論通破見義不別開到不到。	中論通破見義不別開到不到。	02c	The Middle Treatise generally destroys the meaning of views, but does not specifically distinguish between reaching and not reaching.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a08_16']	此論別破到不到義所以然者。	此論別破到不到義所以然者。	02c	This treatise specifically destroys the meaning of reaching and not reaching. The reason is as follows.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a09_3']	中論破內學。	中論破內學。	02c	The Middle Treatise destroys internal learning.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a09_16']	內學大小乘人但明不到能見。	內學大小乘人但明不到能見。	02c	Internal learners of the Mahayana and Hinayana only clarify that the mind that does not reach can see.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a10_5']	故中論直破其見。	故中論直破其見。	02c	Therefore, the Middle Treatise directly destroys its views.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a10_14']	外道具執到不到見。	外道具執到不到見。	02c	External teachings both grasp the views of reaching and not reaching.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a11_3']	故此論具破二迷。	故此論具破二迷。	02c	Therefore, this treatise completely destroys the two delusions.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a11_8']	所言情者。	所言情者。	02c	As for the term mind,
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a11_13']	智度論云。	智度論云。	02c	the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says:
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a12_2']	九十六術不說意識。	九十六術不說意識。	02c	The ninety-six arts do not speak of the thinking consciousness.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a12_16']	意識難解故但明五情及以於意。	意識難解故但明五情及以於意。	02c	The thinking consciousness is difficult to understand, so it only clarifies the five feelings and the mind.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a13_10']	神御於意行眼等中故能見色。	神御於意行眼等中故能見色。	02c	The spirit controls the mind and acts through the eyes and other senses, thus being able to see forms.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a14_2']	問既稱外道不說意識。	問既稱外道不說意識。	02c	Question: Since it is called non-Buddhist, it does not speak of the thinking consciousness.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a14_10']	云何言意行眼門。	云何言意行眼門。	02c	How can it be said that the mind acts through the eyes?
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a15_3']	答外道不明從意根生意識。	答外道不明從意根生意識。	02c	Answer: The non-Buddhists do not understand that the mental consciousness arises from the mind faculty.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a15_15']	但言有心平等根名之為意。	但言有心平等根名之為意。	02c	They only say that there is a mind that is the equal of the faculties, which is called the mind.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a16_15']	今言破情者有二義。	今言破情者有二義。	02c	Now, the word destroy has two meanings.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a17_7']	一者正破外道無六計六。	一者正破外道無六計六。	02c	First, it directly refutes the non-Buddhists' view of six where there are none.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a17_16']	傍破內人橫謂之六。	傍破內人橫謂之六。	02c	Secondarily, it refutes the Buddhists who mistakenly think there are six.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a18_13']	二者若內若外有此六情名皆起佛法。	二者若內若外有此六情名皆起佛法。	02c	Second, whether internal or external, these six faculties are all terms that arise from the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a18_17']	成論云。	成論云。	02c	The Satyasiddhi Śāstra says:
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a19_6']	劫初物未有名字。	劫初物未有名字。	02c	At the beginning of the eon, things did not yet have names.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a19_17']	聖人為受用故假為立名。	聖人為受用故假為立名。	02c	The sages, for the sake of receiving and using them, provisionally established names for them.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a20_3']	如瓶衣等。	如瓶衣等。	02c	Like vases, clothes, etc.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a20_11']	問聖人何故說六。	問聖人何故說六。	02c	Question: Why did the sages speak of six?
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a21_1']	答道門未曾六不六。	答道門未曾六不六。	02c	Answer: The Way has never been six or not six.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a21_11']	但為顛倒故受此六根。	但為顛倒故受此六根。	02c	It is only because of delusion that one receives these six faculties.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a22_1']	聖人欲令其悟六無。	聖人欲令其悟六無。	02c	The sages want to make them realize the non-existence of six.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a22_6']	是故說六。	是故說六。	02c	Therefore, they speak of six.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a23_1']	如經云為令悟第一義故說世諦。	如經云為令悟第一義故說世諦。	02c	As the sūtra says: In order to make them realize the ultimate truth, the conventional truth is spoken.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a23_8']	所以令悟六無。	所以令悟六無。	02c	The reason for making them realize the non-existence of six is as follows:
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a24_3']	六者三世諸佛出世皆為一大事。	六者三世諸佛出世皆為一大事。	02c	Sixth, all Buddhas of the three times appear in the world for one great matter.

['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a25_3']	諸佛知見即是四智。	諸佛知見即是四智。	02c	The Buddhas' knowledge and insight are precisely the four knowledges.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a25_16']	觀此六情本來寂滅名如來智。	觀此六情本來寂滅名如來智。	02c	Contemplating that these six faculties are originally quiescent and extinguished is called the knowledge of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a26_15']	雖復寂滅於顛倒眾生宛然而六即是佛智。	雖復寂滅於顛倒眾生宛然而六即是佛智。	02c	Although quiescent and extinguished, for deluded sentient beings they are clearly present as six, which is precisely the Buddha's knowledge.
['ZH_T42_1827_02c:0281a27_2']	悟六無六。	悟六無六。	02c	Realizing that the six are non-existent,
