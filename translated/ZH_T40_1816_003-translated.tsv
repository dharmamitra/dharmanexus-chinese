Among the three grounds, it is called the ground of pure mind. Because of attaining untaintedness, it is called the mind of equality, and because of the four kinds of purity, it is called the pure mind.

Because the mind that contemplates with characteristics has something to attain, one is still unable to realize true ultimate reality.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0765c19_19']	加行位後，入見道時，以泯相故，住無所得，內冥至理，證真勝義，名入證道。	加行位後，入見道時，以泯相故，住無所得，內冥至理，證真勝義，名入證道。	After the stage of preparatory practice, when one enters the path of seeing, because one obliterates characteristics, one abides in the non-attainment of anything, internally merging with the ultimate principle, realizing true ultimate reality, called entering the path of realization.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0765c21_4']	得證道時，獲一種智，成妙、大身，為顯此義，有此文也。	得證道時，獲一種智，成妙、大身，為顯此義，有此文也。	When one attains the path of realization, one obtains one kind of wisdom, forming a wondrous, great body. To illustrate this meaning, there is this text.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0765c23_20']	天親菩薩論云，第一大段釋疑之中，從「如來所得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，於是中」下有二，此當第二，舉喻彰身，以譬虛實。	天親菩薩論云，第一大段釋疑之中，從「如來所得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，於是中」下有二，此當第二，舉喻彰身，以譬虛實。	The commentary by Bodhisattva Vasubandhu states: The first major section explains doubts. From 'The anuttara-samyak-sambodhi attained by the Tathāgata, within this...' there are two parts. This is the second part, using a metaphor to illustrate the body, comparing it to emptiness and reality.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a01_8']	由此所得，明阿耨菩提不實不妄，謂以如來得彼菩提故不妄，非實有為相故不實，即顯離二障故，得名妙身；	由此所得，明阿耨菩提不實不妄，謂以如來得彼菩提故不妄，非實有為相故不實，即顯離二障故，得名妙身；	Because of this attainment clarifies that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi is neither real nor false. It is said that because the Tathāgata attains that bodhi, it is not false. Because it is not a real conditioned characteristic, it is not real. It is precisely shown that because it is free from the two hindrances, it can be called a wondrous body;
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a02_2']	遍一切處，功德大故，得名大身；	遍一切處，功德大故，得名大身；	because its merits are great, it pervades everywhere, it can be called a great body;

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a06_3']	又云，世親菩薩論唯依真如釋妙、大也，或二論同俱妙、大，亦通法、報故，淨心地名有通有別。	又云，世親菩薩論唯依真如釋妙、大也，或二論同俱妙、大，亦通法、報故，淨心地名有通有別。	It also says that Vasubandhu's treatise only uses true suchness to explain the wondrous and great, or that the two treatises are the same in being both wondrous and great, and also generally refer to the Dharma and reward bodies, so the name stage of pure mind has both general and specific meanings.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a07_5']	依《莊嚴論》，唯判於初地，名淨心地，從初得處為名。	依《莊嚴論》，唯判於初地，名淨心地，從初得處為名。	According to the Adorning the Great Vehicle Treatise, it only classifies the first ground as the stage of pure mind, taking the name from the initial attainment.

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a11_11']	若通則從初地乃至十地，總名清淨定行地。	若通則從初地乃至十地，總名清淨定行地。	if generally, then from the first ground up to the tenth ground, it is collectively called the stage of pure concentration practice.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a12_10']	此中說入淨心地人得二種智，據通說也。	此中說入淨心地人得二種智，據通說也。	Here it is said that a person who enters the stage of pure mind attains two kinds of wisdom, which is explained generally.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a14_1']	離慢亦通十地說故，十地說斷十無明故，斷十重障，八十地故。	離慢亦通十地說故，十地說斷十無明故，斷十重障，八十地故。	The elimination of pride also generally applies to the ten grounds, because it is said that the ten grounds eliminate ten kinds of ignorance, and eliminate ten layers of obstacles, and eighty grounds.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a15_11']	經文有二，謂得智、離慢。	經文有二，謂得智、離慢。	The text of the sūtra has two parts: the attainment of wisdom and the elimination of pride.

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a22_2']	云何得智下，是釋得智中有二，初、問標二智，後、正釋二智。	云何得智下，是釋得智中有二，初、問標二智，後、正釋二智。	What is the attainment of wisdom? Below this explains the attainment of wisdom. There are two parts: first, it asks and labels the two kinds of wisdom; second, it correctly explains the two kinds of wisdom.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a23_16']	初、釋種姓智，云能得妙身者，由得無分別智，決定能紹如來位，故名種姓智；	初、釋種姓智，云能得妙身者，由得無分別智，決定能紹如來位，故名種姓智；	First, explaining the knowledge of the lineage. As for being able to attain the wondrous body, it is because by attaining non-discriminating cognition, one is able to definitely succeed to the position of the Tathāgata, thus it is called the knowledge of the lineage;
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a25_2']	得此智已，當得成佛法、報等身，故言能得於妙身也。	得此智已，當得成佛法、報等身，故言能得於妙身也。	having attained this cognition, one will attain the Dharma body, retribution body, etc., of a Buddha, thus it says being able to attain the wondrous body.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766a26_11']	故前卷云，「至得成就身，得畢竟轉依」故，當得畢竟二轉依果也。	故前卷云，「至得成就身，得畢竟轉依」故，當得畢竟二轉依果也。	Therefore the previous chapter says, attaining the accomplishment of the body, attaining the ultimate transmutation of the support, thus one will attain the ultimate two fruits of transmutation of the support.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b01_3']	天親亦云，遠離二障得畢竟法身、妙身之義，如前皆說，戒即初地分得三身，名為能得，謂初地以上隨位證得遍行等真如故，名畢竟通達轉，亦不違也。	天親亦云，遠離二障得畢竟法身、妙身之義，如前皆說，戒即初地分得三身，名為能得，謂初地以上隨位證得遍行等真如故，名畢竟通達轉，亦不違也。	As for the meaning of attaining the ultimate Dharma body and wondrous body, as explained above, Asvabhāva also says, far removed from the two obstructions, attaining the ultimate Dharma body and wondrous body. As for the precepts being the partial attainment of the three bodies in the first ground, it is called being able to attain, referring to the suchness of universal practice and so forth that is realized according to the stage from the first ground onward, thus it is called the ultimate thorough understanding and transmutation, which is also not contradictory.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b05_12']	次、解平等智，由證平等真法界故，離我、我所，化眾生時，於自他身得五種平等心，能攝一切眾生身，總為自大身一故，名平等智，《大莊嚴論》亦說入淨心地得五種平等，與此名有同異，其義不殊也。	次、解平等智，由證平等真法界故，離我、我所，化眾生時，於自他身得五種平等心，能攝一切眾生身，總為自大身一故，名平等智，《大莊嚴論》亦說入淨心地得五種平等，與此名有同異，其義不殊也。	Next, the understanding of the equality wisdom is due to realizing the equal true Dharma realm. When free from self and mine, when transforming sentient beings, one attains the five kinds of equal minds towards one's own body and the bodies of others. One is able to include all sentient beings' bodies, collectively making them one's own great body. Therefore, it is called the equality wisdom. The Mahā-sukha-vajra-sañcaya-tantra also says that upon entering the stage of pure mind, one attains the five kinds of equality. The names are the same as this, but the meanings are not different.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b07_13']	此初麁惡平等者，是我、我所執，是障根本，果苦同生故名麁惡，由離此故，得平等名。	此初麁惡平等者，是我、我所執，是障根本，果苦同生故名麁惡，由離此故，得平等名。	This first coarse and evil equality is the grasping of self and mine. It is the root obstacle. Because the fruits and sufferings are born together, it is called coarse and evil. Due to being free from this, one attains the name of equality.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b09_17']	《莊嚴論》第一名無我平等，第二法無我平等，謂出觀度生，但見自他五蘊之法皆如幻化，名法無我。	《莊嚴論》第一名無我平等，第二法無我平等，謂出觀度生，但見自他五蘊之法皆如幻化，名法無我。	The Mahā-sukha-vajra-sañcaya-tantra's first is called the equality of no-self, and the second is the equality of the non-self of dharmas. It means that upon emerging from meditation to deliver beings, one only sees the dharmas of the five aggregates of self and others as all being like illusory transformations. This is called the non-self of dharmas.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b13_12']	《莊嚴》第二名有苦平等，彼自釋云，謂於自他所有苦法無差別故，意云，由無我所分別相，見彼有苦法時，與自身空有苦法平等，名法無我平等，自他苦法名為法故。	《莊嚴》第二名有苦平等，彼自釋云，謂於自他所有苦法無差別故，意云，由無我所分別相，見彼有苦法時，與自身空有苦法平等，名法無我平等，自他苦法名為法故。	The second of the four equalities in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha is called equality of suffering, and it is explained as meaning that one's own suffering and the suffering of others are not distinguished, that is, when one sees the suffering of others, one is equal to one's own emptiness and the suffering of dharmas, because of the absence of the conceptualization of mine. This is called the equality of the selflessness of dharmas, because the suffering of self and others is called dharmas.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b14_16']	第三斷相應平等，謂永斷他苦，與斷自苦心相應故。	第三斷相應平等，謂永斷他苦，與斷自苦心相應故。	The third is the equality of the association with abandonment, that is, abandoning the suffering of others is associated with the mind that abandons one's own suffering.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b16_6']	《莊嚴》第三名所作平等，彼自釋云，謂於自他作斷苦事，無差別故。	《莊嚴》第三名所作平等，彼自釋云，謂於自他作斷苦事，無差別故。	The third of the four equalities in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha is called equality of what is to be done, and it is explained as meaning that there is no distinction between abandoning the suffering of self and others.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b18_13']	第四無悕望心相應平等，謂斷他苦，與他樂時，不望其報，與斷自苦、與自樂不望報心相應，故名平等。	第四無悕望心相應平等，謂斷他苦，與他樂時，不望其報，與斷自苦、與自樂不望報心相應，故名平等。	The fourth is the equality of the association with a mind that does not seek reward, that is, when abandoning the suffering of others and bringing about their happiness, one does not expect a reward, and it is associated with the mind that abandons one's own suffering and brings about one's own happiness without expecting a reward, and therefore it is called equality.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b20_34']	後論第四名不望平等，後自釋云，謂於自他拔苦與樂，不求報心，無差別故此前四平等總當《攝論》資糧不足中得一切眾生心平等也。	後論第四名不望平等，後自釋云，謂於自他拔苦與樂，不求報心，無差別故此前四平等總當《攝論》資糧不足中得一切眾生心平等也。	The fourth equality in the later treatise is called not expecting equality, and it is explained later that it means that in relieving the suffering and bringing happiness to oneself and others, one does not seek a reward, because there is no distinction. These first four equalities correspond to the equality of mind towards all sentient beings in the insufficient provisions section of the Compendium Treatise.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b22_16']	第五一切菩薩證道平等，如諸菩薩證平等法界，於自他身得平等心，我亦同得。	第五一切菩薩證道平等，如諸菩薩證平等法界，於自他身得平等心，我亦同得。	The fifth is the equality of the realization of the path by all bodhisattvas, which is like the bodhisattvas realizing the equal dharma realm and attaining an equal mind towards oneself and others, and oneself also attaining the same.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b27_4']	彼第五名同得平等，彼自釋云，如諸菩薩所得，我得亦爾，無差別故此當《攝論》得一切菩薩心平等，《攝論》更有得一切諸佛心平等，略不說體，由於眾生得此五種平等心故，能攝一切他身，總為得一大身，故論結云，得此平等故，得大身等也。	彼第五名同得平等，彼自釋云，如諸菩薩所得，我得亦爾，無差別故此當《攝論》得一切菩薩心平等，《攝論》更有得一切諸佛心平等，略不說體，由於眾生得此五種平等心故，能攝一切他身，總為得一大身，故論結云，得此平等故，得大身等也。	The fifth is called attaining equality, which they themselves explain as meaning that what is attained by bodhisattvas is also attained by oneself, because there is no difference. This corresponds to the attaining the equality of the minds of all bodhisattvas in the Compendium Treatise. The Compendium Treatise has another [type of equality] called attaining the equality of the minds of all buddhas, which is omitted here. Because one attains these five types of equal minds towards sentient beings, one is able to gather all other bodies into a single great body. Therefore the treatise concludes by saying, Because one attains this equality, one attains a great body, and so forth.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b28_2']	世親論意，真如自體離二障，故名妙身；	世親論意，真如自體離二障，故名妙身；	The meaning of Vasubandhu's treatise is that the essence of suchness is free from the two obstructions, and is therefore called the subtle body.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766b28_17']	遍一切處，及功德大，名為大身。	遍一切處，及功德大，名為大身。	It is omnipresent and has great merit, and is therefore called the great body.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c02_1']	《十地經》說，入初地時得百法明門，即此但說得二智者，自利證真，利他平等，此二要故，佛偏說也。	《十地經》說，入初地時得百法明門，即此但說得二智者，自利證真，利他平等，此二要故，佛偏說也。	The Daśabhūmika-sūtra says that when one enters the first ground, one attains the illumination of a hundred dharmas. This [Compendium Treatise] only speaks of attaining two knowledges because the two of benefiting oneself by realizing the truth and benefiting others by equality are essential, and the Buddha therefore speaks of them in particular.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c02_17']	《莊嚴論》云，何故初地名歡喜耶？	《莊嚴論》云，何故初地名歡喜耶？	The Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃkāra says, Why is the first ground called 'Joyful'?
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c04_4']	由見真、利物故，於二利中，此二最要故，如來說有是二智也。	由見真、利物故，於二利中，此二最要故，如來說有是二智也。	Because of seeing the truth and benefiting beings, these two are the most essential in the two benefits, thus the Tathāgata speaks of having these two knowledges.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c06_3']	次第二釋善現安立第一義中，初、標其經，次、解其義。	次第二釋善現安立第一義中，初、標其經，次、解其義。	Next, the second explanation of the establishment of the ultimate truth in the Sūtra of Skillful Means, first, it cites the sūtra, next, it explains the meaning.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c07_1']	此有二意，一、為破前攝他為自大身執。	此有二意，一、為破前攝他為自大身執。	This has two meanings: first, to refute the previous grasping of others as one's own great body.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c09_3']	若以平等心總攝自他為一身，非自非他，亦非自身，故論云，「於彼身安立非自非他」等。	若以平等心總攝自他為一身，非自非他，亦非自身，故論云，「於彼身安立非自非他」等。	If one universally embraces self and other as one body with an impartial mind, it is neither self nor other, nor one's own body, thus the treatise says, In that body, establishing neither self nor other, and so forth.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c11_6']	二、為破尋二身名起執故，雙安立二身為第一義，故論云，「此於妙身等中，安立第一義」，如是等。	二、為破尋二身名起執故，雙安立二身為第一義，故論云，「此於妙身等中，安立第一義」，如是等。	Second, to refute the arising of grasping by seeking the names of the two bodies, the two bodies are jointly established as the ultimate truth, thus the treatise says, In the wondrous body and so forth, establishing the ultimate truth, and so forth.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c13_8']	依真諦本及唐本此論本，皆雙安立二身即非身，令諸菩薩離增益失，又亦雙結，令離損減失。	依真諦本及唐本此論本，皆雙安立二身即非身，令諸菩薩離增益失，又亦雙結，令離損減失。	Based on Paramārtha's original text and the Tang version, this treatise establishes both bodies as non-bodies, causing bodhisattvas to avoid the error of superimposition, and also concludes both, causing them to avoid the error of deprecation.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c14_5']	羅什本及魏本非結，皆闕妙身也。	羅什本及魏本非結，皆闕妙身也。	The Kumārajīva version and the Wei version do not conclude, and both lack the wondrous body.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c15_22']	世親菩薩云，「非身者無有諸相」，「大身者有真如體，如是即名妙身、大身」。	世親菩薩云，「非身者無有諸相」，「大身者有真如體，如是即名妙身、大身」。	Vasubandhu Bodhisattva says, Non-body means having no characteristics, Great body means having the essence of suchness, and this is called the wondrous body and the great body.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c16_8']	經在第三，佛為印可。	經在第三，佛為印可。	The sūtra is in the third [part], with the Buddha's approval.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c17_5']	什、魏二本不正，餘本皆云，「佛言：	什、魏二本不正，餘本皆云，「佛言：	The Kumārajīva and Wei versions are incorrect, while the other versions all say, The Buddha said:
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c18_8']	『如是，如是須菩提』」，以須菩提安立二身合理，故重印可。	『如是，如是須菩提』」，以須菩提安立二身合理，故重印可。	Thus it is, Subhūti. Because Subhūti's establishment of the two bodies accords with reason, [the Buddha] thus repeatedly approves.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0766c21_3']	下解離慢，經文有三，初、明起我度發慢不名菩薩，次、顯諸法無實除度執，後、引佛說證結成上。	下解離慢，經文有三，初、明起我度發慢不名菩薩，次、顯諸法無實除度執，後、引佛說證結成上。	Below is the explanation of being free from conceit. The sūtra text has three parts. First, it clarifies that giving rise to the conceit of self-liberation is not called being a bodhisattva. Second, it reveals that all dharmas are without reality, removing attachment to the perfections. Third, it cites the Buddha's teachings to prove and conclude the above.

Zhendi, Nengduan, and this treatise all say If a bodhisattva thinks like this, only the translations by Kumārajīva and Wei do not have the word bodhisattva, because it mistakenly entered the previous passage on approval. Therefore, its meaning can be understood, and the sutra text is not explained. The second teaches eliminating grasping and crossing over, as explained in the first and sixth chapters of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra. The bodhisattva is only a name, and the name is also empty, so it says in reality there is no dharma called bodhisattva.

However, the innate habit-energy of self has not yet been eliminated, and one has not yet attained the mindfulness that prevents regression. Therefore, when saving sentient beings, there may still be that thought, and the view of self may arise once, due to the arrogance of thinking 'I save others.'

Even up to the seventh ground, it still teaches not to be attached to self and sentient beings, and not to see any dharmas that can give rise to arrogance.

If the pride of attachment to practices and the pride of attachment to dharmas arise, then up to the seventh ground there is forgetfulness, all due to the pride of thinking I will save others.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0767a29_4']	《大品經》教七地菩薩不著我、不著眾生、不見有法可作慢者，故知至七地，終方除度他慢盡也。	《大品經》教七地菩薩不著我、不著眾生、不見有法可作慢者，故知至七地，終方除度他慢盡也。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra teaches the bodhisattvas of the seventh ground not to be attached to self, not to be attached to sentient beings, and not to see any dharmas that can give rise to pride. Therefore, we know that it is only at the end of the seventh ground that the pride of thinking I will save others is completely eliminated.

By attaining the two kinds of knowledge, one subsumes the ten superior practices, because knowledge is foremost among the benefits for oneself and others.

This is based on the biased fault of arrogance. Therefore, the Mahāyānasaṃgraha calls them the ten ignorances, because of the increase of delusion and obscurity.

However, the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, etc., according to the stage and the capacity of the practitioner, explains it biasedly in terms of one aspect. Now, although it is conceit, in reality, it is common to the ten grounds. It is abandoned in each stage. The afflictions and the knowable, whether in actuality or in seeds, whether in essence or in habit, are either subdued or abandoned, as explained according to the circumstances.

This means that ordinary sentient beings only believe and understand the two kinds of non-self, while the sages and bodhisattvas realize and know the two kinds of non-self through worldly and supramundane wisdom. Thus, by ordinary beings and sages, it is said twice that they are bodhisattvas, because they are categorized by worldly and supramundane truths. Only the version translated by Kumārajīva does not have the repetition of non-self. Perhaps the character no is used once to refer to both self and dharmas below, and the text is missing the passage on bodhisattvas. However, the meaning of the Pure Land is explained elsewhere.

However, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra, in discussing the Dharma eye of the bodhisattva, says it is the knowledge of the faculties, desires, and natures of sentient beings, and the knowledge of the various methods for liberating sentient beings.

In the following difficult point, fearing that people would give rise to attachments based on the name of merit and virtue, it establishes the ultimate truth of merit and virtue, teaching the bodhisattvas to cultivate merit without grasping, avoiding the two faults of addition and subtraction.

The mark of the invisible crown protrusion is mentioned first among the eighty kinds of good characteristics in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, and at the end of the thirty-two marks in the Nirvana Sutra.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0772a19_16']	若據《大論》、《持地》，校量詺相功德，無見頂相最大，然諸經在八十種好初。	若據《大論》、《持地》，校量詺相功德，無見頂相最大，然諸經在八十種好初。	If based on the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra and the Sūtra on the Ten Stages, comparing and measuring the merits of the marks, the mark of the invisible crown protrusion is the greatest.

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0772a22_1']	此問有二意，一、依對治義問，破菩薩取佛色身相執，令以無相心求；	此問有二意，一、依對治義問，破菩薩取佛色身相執，令以無相心求；	This question has two meanings. First, based on the meaning of counteracting, it asks to break the bodhisattva's attachment to the Buddha's form body and marks, causing them to seek with a formless mind;
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0772a23_9']	二、依說相意問，顯佛身具足八十種好，令請菩薩起欲願心故。	二、依說相意問，顯佛身具足八十種好，令請菩薩起欲願心故。	Second, based on the meaning of the appearance of speech, it shows that the Buddha's body is fully endowed with eighty kinds of excellent characteristics, causing the bodhisattvas to give rise to a mind of desire and aspiration.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0772a25_19']	「如來說具足色身，即非具足色身」者，此引《大品經》釋，佛於《大品經》數處說八十種好空，故言如來說即非也。	「如來說具足色身，即非具足色身」者，此引《大品經》釋，佛於《大品經》數處說八十種好空，故言如來說即非也。	The Tathāgata's teaching of the fully endowed physical body is not the fully endowed physical body - this quotes the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra to explain. The Buddha repeatedly taught the emptiness of the eighty kinds of excellent characteristics in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, therefore it says the Tathāgata's teaching is not.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0772b01_9']	若爾，何須理此八十種好者，《涅槃經》釋世間眾生事八十種天，彼八十天各有一一好相，令人信向，佛為化彼事天眾生信入佛法，亦令彼天除憍慢心故，佛於一身土現八十具相，令求故舉問也。	若爾，何須理此八十種好者，《涅槃經》釋世間眾生事八十種天，彼八十天各有一一好相，令人信向，佛為化彼事天眾生信入佛法，亦令彼天除憍慢心故，佛於一身土現八十具相，令求故舉問也。	If that is so, why is it necessary to explain these eighty kinds of excellent characteristics? The Nirvana Sutra explains that worldly beings serve eighty kinds of heavenly beings. Each of those eighty heavenly beings has a single excellent characteristic that causes people to have faith and belief. The Buddha, in order to transform those beings who serve the heavenly beings and cause them to enter the Buddha's teachings, and also to cause those heavenly beings to eliminate their arrogant and conceited minds, manifests eighty fully endowed characteristics in a single body and land. In order to seek them, he raises the question.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0772b03_1']	善現知問有破執意故，即安立色身為第一義，故言即非具足色身。	善現知問有破執意故，即安立色身為第一義，故言即非具足色身。	Subhūti, knowing that the question has the meaning of refuting attachments, immediately establishes the physical body as the ultimate truth, therefore he says it is not the fully endowed physical body.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0772b04_14']	「是故如來說名具足色身」者，為成菩薩求佛色身意故，俗諦說名具足色身。	「是故如來說名具足色身」者，為成菩薩求佛色身意故，俗諦說名具足色身。	Therefore the Tathagata is said to be endowed with the complete physical body means that in order to accomplish the bodhisattva's intention to seek the Buddha's physical body, the conventional truth is said to be the complete physical body.

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c09_4']	下釋義，釋義中菩提自相故者，明佛得菩提時雖得諸法實相而不分別見有得，此解經中不可得菩提，自相不得故。	下釋義，釋義中菩提自相故者，明佛得菩提時雖得諸法實相而不分別見有得，此解經中不可得菩提，自相不得故。	Below it explains the meaning. In explaining the meaning, because of the intrinsic characteristic of bodhi clarifies that when the Buddha attained bodhi, although he attained the true characteristics of all dharmas, he did not discriminate and see that there was attainment. This explains the sutra's inconceivable attainment of bodhi, because the intrinsic characteristic cannot be attained.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c11_1']	解脫相故者，亦不見有菩提實體，此釋不可有也，離障解脫所有相體不可得故。	解脫相故者，亦不見有菩提實體，此釋不可有也，離障解脫所有相體不可得故。	Because of the characteristic of liberation means also not seeing any real essence of bodhi. This explains that it cannot exist, because the characteristic essence of liberation from hindrances cannot be obtained.

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c15_5']	什、魏二本皆總相云無有少法可得，唐及真諦本咸以無有為先，無得為後，若爾，即以菩提自相解無有，不見菩提自體有故，以解脫相釋無得，不見解脫是可得故。	什、魏二本皆總相云無有少法可得，唐及真諦本咸以無有為先，無得為後，若爾，即以菩提自相解無有，不見菩提自體有故，以解脫相釋無得，不見解脫是可得故。	Both the Qin and Wei versions generally say that there is no dharma that can be obtained, while the Tang and Paramārtha versions both have non-existence first and non-attainment later. If so, then using the self-characteristic of bodhi to explain non-existence, because one does not see the self-essence of bodhi existing, and using the characteristic of liberation to explain non-attainment, because one does not see liberation as something that can be attained.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c16_13']	或有解云，無有者，雖得能得無上覺智，而不見有能覺知故；	或有解云，無有者，雖得能得無上覺智，而不見有能覺知故；	Some explain that non-existence means that although one attains the supreme wisdom of enlightenment, one does not see any knowing that can be enlightened;
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c18_17']	無得者，雖得所得之實相，亦不見有所得實相，配論應知，即是《大品經》說，無知亦無得也。	無得者，雖得所得之實相，亦不見有所得實相，配論應知，即是《大品經》說，無知亦無得也。	Non-attainment means that although one attains the true characteristics that are attained, one also does not see any true characteristics that can be attained. The treatise should be understood as such, which is the same as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra saying no knowing and no attainment.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c19_20']	此解意說，初語之中通能、所證，第二語中唯能證智。	此解意說，初語之中通能、所證，第二語中唯能證智。	This explanation means that in the first statement, both what is realized and the realization are included, while in the second statement, only the realizing wisdom is mentioned.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c22_1']	若據真諦本，先云無法如來所捨，明佛轉依，捨徵障時不見少法可捨，此顯菩提解脫相；	若據真諦本，先云無法如來所捨，明佛轉依，捨徵障時不見少法可捨，此顯菩提解脫相；	If based on the original text of the true meaning, it first says there is no dharma that the Tathāgata abandons, clarifying that when the Buddha's transformation of the basis abandons the obstacles, he does not see even the slightest dharma that can be abandoned. This reveals the characteristic of bodhi and liberation.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0773c24_11']	後云無法如來所得，明佛得無上覺，於一切法得無礙知見，亦不見能得、所得，此顯佛無上覺相，故名菩提自相。	後云無法如來所得，明佛得無上覺，於一切法得無礙知見，亦不見能得、所得，此顯佛無上覺相，故名菩提自相。	Later it says there is no dharma that the Tathāgata attains, clarifying that when the Buddha attains supreme enlightenment, he attains unobstructed knowledge and insight regarding all dharmas, and also does not see what can be attained or what is attained. This reveals the characteristic of the Buddha's supreme enlightenment, and is therefore called the intrinsic characteristic of bodhi.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a01_6']	下第二解三佛陀語，經名菩提，以通二乘及因果，故論名佛陀，唯在佛果。	下第二解三佛陀語，經名菩提，以通二乘及因果，故論名佛陀，唯在佛果。	Below is the second explanation of the three statements on buddhahood. The sūtra is called bodhi because it extends to the two vehicles and their causes and effects, while the treatise calls it buddhahood because it is only in the fruition of buddhahood.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a03_1']	依論有三，初、言「是法平等」者，顯諸佛同有無上覺智平等，諸佛同有正覺智故。	依論有三，初、言「是法平等」者，顯諸佛同有無上覺智平等，諸佛同有正覺智故。	According to the treatise, there are three parts. First, it says this dharma is equal, revealing that all buddhas are the same in having the wisdom of supreme enlightenment, because all buddhas are the same in having the wisdom of right enlightenment.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a06_9']	次、云「無有高下」者，顯示諸佛第一義中壽命等無高無下故，化身隨緣示有高下，諸佛實報同證一義成故，壽命、色身、神通、福報皆無高下，故名覺等。	次、云「無有高下」者，顯示諸佛第一義中壽命等無高無下故，化身隨緣示有高下，諸佛實報同證一義成故，壽命、色身、神通、福報皆無高下，故名覺等。	Next, it says without high or low to show that in the ultimate truth of the buddhas, lifespan and so forth are without high or low. The transformation body manifests high and low according to conditions. The actual rewards of the buddhas are the same in realizing the one truth, so lifespan, physical body, spiritual powers, and blessings are all without high or low, and are therefore called equal enlightenment.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a08_16']	第三、「以無眾生」下，明法諸佛同無我、我所等生死不平等心，故名等覺，此論及魏本並漏無，餘皆有也。	第三、「以無眾生」下，明法諸佛同無我、我所等生死不平等心，故名等覺，此論及魏本並漏無，餘皆有也。	Third, below without sentient beings, it clarifies that the buddhas are the same in being without the unequal mind of self and what belongs to self in birth and death, and are therefore called equal enlightenment. This treatise and the Wei version both omit this, while the others all have it.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a09_19']	何故說二語者，一為簡二乘、菩薩，彼非無上故；	何故說二語者，一為簡二乘、菩薩，彼非無上故；	Why speak of two statements? First, to distinguish the two vehicles and bodhisattvas, because they are not unsurpassed;
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a12_7']	二為破二乘疑執，彼疑如來菩提與已不異故，故《大論》云，二乘不名無上覺者，不得一切種智，有所不知故。	二為破二乘疑執，彼疑如來菩提與已不異故，故《大論》云，二乘不名無上覺者，不得一切種智，有所不知故。	second, to break the two vehicles' doubts and attachments, because they doubt that the Tathāgata's enlightenment is no different from their own. Therefore the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, The two vehicles are not called unsurpassed enlightenment, because they do not attain omniscience and there is something they do not know.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a14_5']	以彼二乘法執未除故，見有所得，我我習未斷故，見有能得，由當起我生已盡等念。	以彼二乘法執未除故，見有所得，我我習未斷故，見有能得，由當起我生已盡等念。	Because those of the two vehicles have not yet eliminated the attachment to dharmas, they see that there is something to be attained. Because the habits of self and mine have not yet been severed, they see that there is an attainer. This is because they will give rise to thoughts such as birth is exhausted and so forth.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a15_4']	今明如來不同於彼，故佛菩提有無上語。	今明如來不同於彼，故佛菩提有無上語。	Now it is explained that the Tathāgata is not the same as them, and therefore the Buddha's enlightenment is said to be unsurpassed.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a17_20']	自下大文第二舉佛菩薩因顯佛菩薩果有無上等覺，經文有二，初、正顯，後、破執。	自下大文第二舉佛菩薩因顯佛菩薩果有無上等覺，經文有二，初、正顯，後、破執。	Below this, the second main text uses the causes of the buddhas and bodhisattvas to illustrate the fruits of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, which are unsurpassed and equal enlightenment. The text has two parts: first, the correct illustration, and second, the refutation of attachments.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a20_15']	論隨解經，亦分為二，梁、什、魏本皆云修一切善法得阿耨菩提，從明佛因時具修一切善法滿足故得無上正等菩提，不同二乘。	論隨解經，亦分為二，梁、什、魏本皆云修一切善法得阿耨菩提，從明佛因時具修一切善法滿足故得無上正等菩提，不同二乘。	The treatise follows the sutra and also divides it into two parts. The Liang, Qin, and Wei editions all say that by cultivating all wholesome dharmas one attains anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi. From the time of clarifying the Buddha's causes, he fully cultivated all wholesome dharmas and attained unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, unlike those of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a21_16']	《大品經》第三十八說，一切善法是無上菩提因。	《大品經》第三十八說，一切善法是無上菩提因。	The 38th chapter of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says that all wholesome dharmas are the causes of unsurpassed enlightenment.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a22_3']	須菩提白佛：	須菩提白佛：	Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying:
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a22_12']	「何等是一切善法？	「何等是一切善法？	What are all wholesome dharmas?
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a22_16']	」佛言：	」佛言：	The Buddha said:
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a25_3']	「六波羅蜜、四念處等乃至十八不共法，皆是菩薩道菩薩行，是諸善法具足已，得一切種智，轉法輪度眾生。	「六波羅蜜、四念處等乃至十八不共法，皆是菩薩道菩薩行，是諸善法具足已，得一切種智，轉法輪度眾生。	The six perfections, the four establishments of mindfulness, and so forth, up to the eighteen distinctive abilities of the Buddha, are all the path and practice of the bodhisattva. Having perfected all these wholesome dharmas, one attains omniscience and turns the wheel of the Dharma to liberate sentient beings.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a26_16']	」轉法輪度眾生即復施設大利文，是此明佛具修一切善法故得無上覺等。	」轉法輪度眾生即復施設大利文，是此明佛具修一切善法故得無上覺等。	Turning the wheel of the Dharma to liberate sentient beings is the text that again establishes great benefits. This clarifies that the Buddha, by perfecting the cultivation of all wholesome dharmas, attains supreme enlightenment, and so forth.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774a28_6']	若依真本及唐本，云一切善法無不現證，一切善法無不妙覺。	若依真本及唐本，云一切善法無不現證，一切善法無不妙覺。	If we rely on the true original text and the Tang version, it says, All wholesome dharmas are directly realized, and all wholesome dharmas are wondrously enlightened.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b02_3']	論通說佛因因果，善法圓滿，謂無間道時，一切善法因滿足，徵或永盡，與諸佛同證寂滅忍，故言一切善法無不現證。	論通說佛因因果，善法圓滿，謂無間道時，一切善法因滿足，徵或永盡，與諸佛同證寂滅忍，故言一切善法無不現證。	The treatise generally discusses the causes and effects of the Buddha's causes, and the perfection of wholesome dharmas. It means that at the time of the uninterrupted path, the causes of all wholesome dharmas are fulfilled. When the afflictions are eternally exhausted, one realizes the same extinction as all Buddhas, and therefore it is said that all wholesome dharmas are directly realized.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b04_1']	至解脫道時，微苦亦盡，功德圓滿，與諸佛同名為妙覺，故言一切善法無不妙覺。	至解脫道時，微苦亦盡，功德圓滿，與諸佛同名為妙覺，故言一切善法無不妙覺。	When one reaches the path of liberation, even the subtle suffering is exhausted, and merit is perfected. It is the same as all Buddhas being called wondrously enlightened, and therefore it is said that all wholesome dharmas are wondrously enlightened.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b05_2']	因果皆悉不同二乘，故佛菩提有無上等覺語。	因果皆悉不同二乘，故佛菩提有無上等覺語。	The causes and effects are all completely different from the two vehicles, so the Buddha's enlightenment has the words unsurpassed supreme enlightenment.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b07_6']	次破執者，有人尋善法名起執故，約第一義說善法即非善法，論於此為安立第一義，破增益失；	次破執者，有人尋善法名起執故，約第一義說善法即非善法，論於此為安立第一義，破增益失；	Next, refuting attachment, some people seek the name of good dharmas and give rise to attachment, so in terms of ultimate truth it is said that good dharmas are not good dharmas. The treatise establishes this in order to refute the error of reification;
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b08_12']	復恐撥無緣生善法，故約俗說是名善法，令離損減失。	復恐撥無緣生善法，故約俗說是名善法，令離損減失。	Fearing that one might still deny the arising of good dharmas, it is said in terms of conventional truth that these are called good dharmas, in order to avoid the error of deprecation.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b10_3']	世親解云，是故彼漏非是淨法，此中說善，即是清淨無漏法故。	世親解云，是故彼漏非是淨法，此中說善，即是清淨無漏法故。	Vasubandhu explains, Therefore, those with outflows are not pure dharmas. Here, what is called good is precisely the pure, undefiled dharmas.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b11_8']	又此善法無有漏，故名非善法，以漏無故，是名善法。	又此善法無有漏，故名非善法，以漏無故，是名善法。	Moreover, since these good dharmas are without outflows, they are called not good dharmas. Because there are no outflows, they are called good dharmas.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b12_7']	由是唐本重言，善法或因果二，故重言也。	由是唐本重言，善法或因果二，故重言也。	Therefore, the Tang version repeats good dharmas, because it refers to both the cause and effect of good dharmas.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b15_3']	自下心具足中大文第三論名施設大利法，前明佛證正覺，此明依證起說施設正教大利眾生。	自下心具足中大文第三論名施設大利法，前明佛證正覺，此明依證起說施設正教大利眾生。	Below this, the third main text in the perfection of the mind section of the treatise is called Establishing the Dharma of Great Benefits. The previous section clarified the Buddha's realization of perfect enlightenment, while this section clarifies the establishment of the correct teaching and the bestowal of great benefits to sentient beings based on that realization.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b15_14']	世親此下子段第二疑云：	世親此下子段第二疑云：	Below this, Vasubandhu's second sub-section raises a doubt, saying:
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0774b17_7']	「若一切善法滿足得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者，則所說法不能得大菩提。	「若一切善法滿足得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者，則所說法不能得大菩提。	If one attains supreme perfect enlightenment by perfecting all wholesome dharmas, then the Dharma that is taught cannot lead to great enlightenment.

One hundredth part is not equal to one, which means that the merit of cultivating one verse of this sūtra is one hundredth part. Comparing this to the great giving of much merit, even one hundredth part is still not equal to it, so it says one hundredth part is not equal to one.

This is the beginning of the reverse interpretation based on the sūtra. If it is said that the Buddha sees there are sentient beings to be liberated, the Buddha should still be the same as ordinary beings, not knowing nirvāṇa as it is. If one believes that the Tathāgata, the Buddha, knows nirvāṇa as it is and is not the same as ordinary beings, one must also believe that the Buddha does not see there are sentient beings to be liberated, and therefore has no thought of self or liberation.

Grasping a self is the view of a self.

Paramārtha calls them infant ordinary beings. This treatise calls them childish ordinary beings. Infants and children both take the meaning of foolishness. It says that ordinary beings and the two vehicles are foolish like infants and children, not knowing that the original nature of the self is empty. Hearing the Buddha say that ordinary beings have the thought of self, they seek out the name and grasp at having the thought of self. In order to refute this grasping, it says not so.

Therefore, the Tathāgata does not apprehend, but what the Buddha does not apprehend is what the foolish and ordinary beings apprehend. For this reason, it is called non-apprehension is apprehension.

First, it says that although the characteristics are accomplished, the Tathāgata cannot be seen, because he is not of that essence, but takes the Tathāgata's Dharma body as his essence. However, the Tathāgata's Dharma body is known by seeing the accomplished characteristics, and thus it is known that the Tathāgata's Dharma body has the characteristics of merit.

Ordinary beings, the two vehicles, and lesser bodhisattvas often take the wonderful form and sound characteristics of the buddhas to observe the Buddha. Because of these characteristics, they are unable to see the formless Dharma body, so the Buddha destroys their grasping at the characteristics of form and sound, causing them to contemplate the true suchness Dharma body of the buddhas.

The assembly at the time heard that the Buddha does not attain enlightenment due to the causes of various characteristics, and thus grasps that all buddhas are the same as the two vehicles in eliminating afflictions, attaining the remainder, and abandoning this body to begin abiding in the remainderless. In order to destroy this grasping, the next clarifies that the Buddha does not abide in nirvāṇa.

The translator has erred.

This then clarifies that the Buddha does not speak of the bodhisattva having afflictions to be annihilated and eliminated.

Now, the teaching to Bodhisattvas is that they do not see there is suffering and origin that can be severed or extinguished, so they do not see there is nirvāṇa that can be abided in, and thus it is asked.

It teaches bodhisattvas not to have attachment to nirvāṇa, and therefore to retain afflictions and assist in taking rebirth through vows, abiding within the reflected images of saṃsāra. Therefore it is called not severing.

This is the acceptance of the originally unborn nature.

Understanding means personally understanding no-self and no birth. The merit of faith and understanding can still surpass the great giving and much merit, let alone the Buddha's complete realization of no-self and no birth, whose merit and wisdom are equal to space.

How much more so for the bodhisattva who penetrates no-self and no-birth, cultivates self-benefit and benefiting others with a mind of no characteristics, whose merit surpasses theirs immeasurably and infinitely, yet still accepts the suffering of birth and death?

This means that when cultivating merit, it is said that the substance of non-merit can be received, and it is also grasped that merit can take the fruit of good destinies. Cultivating merit with this mind is the cause of abiding in birth and death. Now, when teaching bodhisattvas to cultivate merit, they do not see any substance of merit that can be received, nor do they see meritorious actions that can take good rewards. Therefore, they should not be attached to either the substance of merit or its fruits. This is called not receiving or appropriating the accumulation of merit.

If there is a body, one cannot escape birth, old age, sickness, and death. Isn't it the case that because of appropriating merit, one experiences the suffering of birth and death?

This means that when bodhisattvas attain the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, they are able to understand that the two selves of beings and dharmas are non-existent, and yet they do not give rise to the two characteristics of non-existence, which is called receiving but not grasping.

This is the grasping oneness conceptualization among the eight conceptualizations in the Madhyāntavibhāga, and it is also the aggregate conceptualization among the eight conceptualizations in the Bodhisattvabhūmi.

The Buddha said that ordinary beings only have the false view of grasping at a self, and there is no real self. The Sutra of Adornment of the Great Vehicle states, In order to eliminate the real self and dharmas grasped at by foolish common beings, the Buddha provisionally speaks of the names of self and dharmas based on the transformations of consciousness.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0781a12_6']	今顯佛說所執我無，但假說有彼我見故，與彼義同。	今顯佛說所執我無，但假說有彼我見故，與彼義同。	Now, it is shown that the Buddha speaks of the non-existence of the grasped at self, but provisionally speaks of the existence of the view of self. Therefore, the meaning is the same as that.

When ordinary beings and the two vehicles hear the Buddha speak of ordinary beings having the views of self, person, etc., they again grasp at the Buddha's speaking of the views of self, person, etc. This is the grasping at dharmas.

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0781a27_2']	何故佛說我見等即非見者，論云，「若有彼我見，是見所攝」，言若執有我見，還是法執見攝，障入相應三昧故，佛教觀我見等即非見也。	何故佛說我見等即非見者，論云，「若有彼我見，是見所攝」，言若執有我見，還是法執見攝，障入相應三昧故，佛教觀我見等即非見也。	Why did the Buddha say that the view of self, etc. are not views? The treatise says, If there is the view of self, it is included in views. It means that if one grasps at the view of self, it is still included in the view of grasping at dharmas, because it obstructs entry into the samādhi of signlessness. Therefore, the Buddha teaches that the view of self, etc. are not views.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0781a29_20']	故世親論云，「見我即不見，無實虛妄見，此是微細障，見真如遠離」，此顯執我之見本不見我，以無實體，但妄見故，我見無體。	故世親論云，「見我即不見，無實虛妄見，此是微細障，見真如遠離」，此顯執我之見本不見我，以無實體，但妄見故，我見無體。	Therefore, Vasubandhu's treatise says, When one sees self, one does not see. The false view of what is unreal is this subtle obstruction, which is far removed from seeing suchness. This shows that the view that grasps at self does not originally see self, because it has no real substance, but is only a false view. Therefore, the view of self has no substance.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0781b02_16']	然法見亦爾，以證如時不見二我，此微細障便得遠離，故知此二見說名不見。	然法見亦爾，以證如時不見二我，此微細障便得遠離，故知此二見說名不見。	However, the view of dharmas is also like this. When realizing suchness, one does not see the two selves. This subtle obstruction is then far removed. Therefore, one should know that these two views are called non-seeing.

Based on the previous non-view of the view of self, one should also know, see, and understand in this way that all dharmas are not dharmas.

The meaning is that when cultivating non-discrimination, the separate cultivation of samādhi and prajñā is two, and the combined cultivation entering into samādhi is one, so there are three phrases.

This shows that when practicing giving, the giving of material things has limits, so giving must be exhausted. The Dharma is limitless, so it is said to be inexhaustible.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0782a17_16']	二、以財施但得世間果報，昔曾已得，即已墮落，今雖更得，必還退失；	二、以財施但得世間果報，昔曾已得，即已墮落，今雖更得，必還退失；	Second, material giving only obtains worldly rewards, which have already been obtained in the past and have already fallen away. Now, although one obtains them again, one will certainly lose them again.

First, observing that the expounder and the expounded are empty, although always expounding, it is like not expounding. Therefore the treatise says, Because it cannot be spoken, it is not expounded. If that dharma has an expounded essence, it should be expounded like this. If it is different from this, it is defiled expounding, because of being inverted. It says that if one does not observe the expounded essence as empty, then one expounds with a mind grasping characteristics, not expounding without defilement.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0782b11_10']	什云，「不取相，如如不動」，謂說法時，如證真如，離於動搖，即餘本言，「如不演說」。	什云，「不取相，如如不動」，謂說法時，如證真如，離於動搖，即餘本言，「如不演說」。	Kumārajīva says, Not grasping characteristics, like suchness, is unmoving. It means that when expounding the dharma, like realizing suchness, one is free from agitation. The other versions say, Like not expounding.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0782b15_11']	二云，以名利心說，則雖恒說如不演說，故論云，「又如是說時，不貪敬供養等，亦為無染說法」，然佛於說此經末無染說法，非唯顯佛於說法中無染，然佛亦教後人以無染心說也。	二云，以名利心說，則雖恒說如不演說，故論云，「又如是說時，不貪敬供養等，亦為無染說法」，然佛於說此經末無染說法，非唯顯佛於說法中無染，然佛亦教後人以無染心說也。	The second explanation is that if one speaks with a mind of fame and profit, then even if one always speaks, it is as if one does not expound. Therefore the treatise says, And when speaking like this, not being greedy for respect, offerings, etc., is also speaking the Dharma without defilement. However, at the end of speaking this sūtra, the Buddha spoke the Dharma without defilement, not only manifesting the Buddha's absence of defilement in speaking the Dharma, but also the Buddha also teaches later people to speak with a mind free from defilement.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0782b18_9']	世親論云，「諸佛說法時，不言是化身，以不如是說，是故彼說正」，彼論意云，佛說法時，不言我是化身，故名而不演說，此意別。	世親論云，「諸佛說法時，不言是化身，以不如是說，是故彼說正」，彼論意云，佛說法時，不言我是化身，故名而不演說，此意別。	Vasubandhu's treatise says, When the Buddhas speak the Dharma, they do not say it is a transformation body. Because it is not spoken like this, therefore their speaking is correct. The meaning of that treatise is that when the Buddha speaks the Dharma, he does not say he is a transformation body, therefore it is called not expounding. This meaning is different.

['ZH_T40_1816_003:0782b22_13']	前總說佛不住生死，由達法無我，此中別說九種觀行，顯於流轉不染，即是成前不住生死義。	前總說佛不住生死，由達法無我，此中別說九種觀行，顯於流轉不染，即是成前不住生死義。	Previously it was said in general that the Buddha does not abide in saṃsāra because he realizes the non-self of dharmas. Here it specifically discusses nine kinds of contemplation, showing that he is not defiled by saṃsāra, which is the same as the previous meaning of not abiding in saṃsāra.
['ZH_T40_1816_003:0782b24_16']	又釋前雖說佛不見有生死可住，何妨生死是有故，此觀佛九種生死法皆虛妄，如星、翳等故。	又釋前雖說佛不見有生死可住，何妨生死是有故，此觀佛九種生死法皆虛妄，如星、翳等故。	Another explanation: although it was previously said that the Buddha does not see saṃsāra as something to abide in, how can it be that saṃsāra exists? Therefore, this contemplation shows that the Buddha's nine kinds of saṃsāra dharmas are all false and illusory, like stars, cataracts, etc.

The verse says, Neither existent nor apart from, the nirvāṇa of all tathāgatas, the nine kinds of conditioned dharmas, due to the correct contemplation of wondrous cognition. This shows that because all buddhas attain nirvāṇa, they do not abide in saṃsāra, and because they manifest worldly activities, they do not abide in nirvāṇa. The transformation body enters nirvāṇa, and the Dharma body always abides.

The first line generally raises conditioned dharmas as the objects of contemplation. The next two lines correctly teach the nine contemplations with nine metaphors, contemplating the nine explanations of conditioned dharmas. The last line concludes by exhorting practice.
