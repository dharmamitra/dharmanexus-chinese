['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c16_9']	此品所說，雖有佛性，而斷善者塞之。	此品所說，雖有佛性，而斷善者塞之。	The present chapter states that although there is Buddha-nature, those who sever wholesome roots block it.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c17_5']	故知俱論性，而有違不違之異也。	故知俱論性，而有違不違之異也。	Therefore, we know that both theories discuss nature, but there is a difference between those that contradict and those that do not contradict.

['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c19_19']	前品廣說佛性不一，或因或果、非因非果，或因或緣、或善非善、或言心是、或言心非，或言離陰、或不如是。	前品廣說佛性不一，或因或果、非因非果，或因或緣、或善非善、或言心是、或言心非，或言離陰、或不如是。	In the previous chapter, the Buddha extensively explained that Buddha-nature is not one, sometimes it is a cause, sometimes it is a result, sometimes it is neither a cause nor a result, sometimes it is a cause, sometimes it is a condition, sometimes it is good, sometimes it is not good, sometimes it is said to be the mind, sometimes it is said not to be the mind, sometimes it is said to be apart from the aggregates, sometimes it is not like this.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c21_9']	眾說雖非一途，而佛性一也，是則不可偏執一法為是而餘法非也。	眾說雖非一途，而佛性一也，是則不可偏執一法為是而餘法非也。	Although the various explanations are not one-sided, Buddha-nature is one. This means that one cannot unilaterally grasp a single dharma as correct and the other dharmas as incorrect.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c23_5']	迦葉今引四十九年不定之說，偏執者皆失佛意，謂執往既失，執今豈得耶？	迦葉今引四十九年不定之說，偏執者皆失佛意，謂執往既失，執今豈得耶？	Now Kāśyapa cites the indeterminate teachings of forty-nine years, and those who grasp one-sidedly all miss the Buddha's intention, saying that grasping the past is already wrong, so how can grasping the present be right?
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c24_2']	若有偏執上所說者，皆不得佛意也。	若有偏執上所說者，皆不得佛意也。	If there are those who unilaterally grasp what was explained above, they all do not understand the Buddha's intention.

['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c27_8']	又說性非內非外、亦內亦外，非有非無、亦有亦無，又就闡提或善根人，四句互明佛性。	又說性非內非外、亦內亦外，非有非無、亦有亦無，又就闡提或善根人，四句互明佛性。	It also says that nature is neither internal nor external, both internal and external, neither existent nor nonexistent, and both existent and nonexistent. It also clarifies buddha-nature in terms of icchantikas or those with wholesome roots, using four statements.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0571c29_12']	復引恒河七人不離佛性水，又言如是七人若善不善、若方便道若解脫道、若因若果，悉是佛性。	復引恒河七人不離佛性水，又言如是七人若善不善、若方便道若解脫道、若因若果，悉是佛性。	It also cites the seven kinds of people in the Ganges River who are not apart from the water of buddha-nature, and says that these seven kinds of people, whether good or bad, whether the path of skillful means or the path of liberation, whether cause or effect, are all buddha-nature.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a01_5']	經文如此，豈可以一法偏執乎？	經文如此，豈可以一法偏執乎？	The sutra text is like this, how can one side be grasped with a single dharma?

['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a04_12']	前品明生死河中有七人，明不但佛性力故，自得菩提，不修道耶？	前品明生死河中有七人，明不但佛性力故，自得菩提，不修道耶？	The previous chapter clarifies that there are seven kinds of people in the river of birth and death, and it is not only because of the power of buddha-nature that one can attain bodhi without cultivating the path, right?
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a06_3']	今明涅槃河中有七種人，闡提人聞《涅槃經》，然後誹謗不信，斷善根耳。	今明涅槃河中有七種人，闡提人聞《涅槃經》，然後誹謗不信，斷善根耳。	Now it is clarified that there are seven kinds of people in the river of nirvana. Only after icchantikas hear the Nirvana Sutra will they slander and not believe it, and only then will they sever their wholesome roots.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a07_7']	然涅槃聲先冥以遠益，謂入涅槃河中，況餘六人耶？	然涅槃聲先冥以遠益，謂入涅槃河中，況餘六人耶？	However, the sound of nirvana first benefits those in the distant past, referring to those who enter the river of nirvana, let alone the other six people?
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a08_3']	今明七人雖異，而皆不離佛性水中。	今明七人雖異，而皆不離佛性水中。	Now, it is explained that although the seven people are different, they are all not apart from the water of buddha-nature.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a08_17']	雖復兩品同明，而所論碩異也。	雖復兩品同明，而所論碩異也。	Although the two chapters are the same in clarifying, the discussed points are vastly different.

Previously, under the chapter on the lion's roar, this discussion was initiated, but the meaning revealed still had not been fully understood. Now, it returns to the original question.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a11_12']	前明闡提雖斷善根，猶有佛性；	前明闡提雖斷善根，猶有佛性；	Previously, it was clarified that even though icchantikas have severed wholesome roots, they still have buddha-nature;

['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a13_12']	明所斷者，是起作之善故，則正因之義存也。	明所斷者，是起作之善故，則正因之義存也。	It is clarified that what is severed is the wholesome of arising and creating, so the meaning of the correct cause remains.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a14_7']	釋還生之由，所以緣因之理足也。	釋還生之由，所以緣因之理足也。	The basis for rebirth is explained, so the principle of the causal condition is complete.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a15_1']	亦以因果相望，則中道詳矣。	亦以因果相望，則中道詳矣。	Also, by comparing cause and effect, the middle way is detailed.

The Lion's Roar discusses it from the perspective of sequence and principle, while Kāśyapa discusses it from the perspective of going against it.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a21_17']	師子吼所說，直論從因至果，附理信心，不言先斷善根，後更生之義也。	師子吼所說，直論從因至果，附理信心，不言先斷善根，後更生之義也。	What the Lion's Roar says is simply discussing going from cause to effect, relying on principle and faith, not mentioning the meaning of severing wholesome roots first and then giving rise to them later.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a24_1']	迦葉所說，亦言從因次修，然其行未立，還斷信心成一闡提，後厭情還發，能生於善，更進趣取佛。	迦葉所說，亦言從因次修，然其行未立，還斷信心成一闡提，後厭情還發，能生於善，更進趣取佛。	What Kāśyapa says also mentions going from cause to cultivation, but their practice is not yet established, so they sever faith and become icchantikas. Later, their disgusted feelings give rise to wholesome [thoughts] again, and they can progress and attain Buddhahood.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a24_7']	正以此為異。	正以此為異。	This is precisely the difference.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a25_2']	是則師子吼雖明斷善，未辨還生。	是則師子吼雖明斷善，未辨還生。	This means that although the Lion's Roar Sutra clarifies the severing of wholesome roots, it does not yet distinguish their subsequent arising.
['ZH_T37_1763_063:0572a25_19']	今迦葉所論，明斷善之後更生之義也。	今迦葉所論，明斷善之後更生之義也。	Now, what Kāśyapa discusses clarifies the meaning of the subsequent arising after severing wholesome roots.
