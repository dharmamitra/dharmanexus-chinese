This defiled mental consciousness ceases in the intermediate existence, and in the mother's womb, the consciousnesses and kalala unite with each other.

This is unreasonable.

As a result of the method of establishing a conclusion, it is shown that it contradicts the specific characteristics of that dharma. That is, it is definitely not the case that if it is mental consciousness, it is supported by the defiled in all destinies, in all its varieties, and at all times, as does mental consciousness at a later time.
['ZH_T31_1598_003:0392c25_18']	如是結生相續時識，於一切處、一切種類、一切時分皆依染污，即中有攝，後心為依，此所依心生有為境，於一切處、一切種類、一切時分是染污故。	如是結生相續時識，於一切處、一切種類、一切時分皆依染污，即中有攝，後心為依，此所依心生有為境，於一切處、一切種類、一切時分是染污故。	In this way, the consciousness at the time of the binding together of a life and the continuation of a life is supported by the defiled in all destinies, in all its varieties, and at all times, and it is the consciousness that is included in the intermediate existence. The consciousness that is its support is born with the existence as its object, and it is defiled in all destinies, in all its varieties, and at all times.

The mind that has already been transmitted must be defiled, because it is already established as indeterminate and of the nature of retribution.
['ZH_T31_1598_003:0392c29_17']	由異熟性時無間斷，由此亦遮是意識性。	由異熟性時無間斷，由此亦遮是意識性。	Because the nature of retribution is uninterrupted at all times, this also refutes the idea that it is mental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1598_003:0393a01_17']	意識所緣不可得故者，此義重增遮意識因。	意識所緣不可得故者，此義重增遮意識因。	Because the object of mental consciousness cannot be apprehended, this meaning further increases the refutation of mental consciousness.

['ZH_T31_1598_003:0393a05_8']	不應以彼住滅定心為此妨難，不許彼是意識性故。	不應以彼住滅定心為此妨難，不許彼是意識性故。	One should not use the mind abiding in samādhi as an objection to this, because it is not accepted as being of the nature of mental consciousness.

['ZH_T31_1598_003:0393a07_11']	以於爾時非無有法，雖是其有而不可知。	以於爾時非無有法，雖是其有而不可知。	Because at that time there is no dharma that does not exist. Although it exists, it cannot be known.

['ZH_T31_1598_003:0398c01_10']	如是已釋阿賴耶識所有句義、異門、訓詞、體相、決擇及與差別，復欲顯此能順正行，故起問答。	如是已釋阿賴耶識所有句義、異門、訓詞、體相、決擇及與差別，復欲顯此能順正行，故起問答。	Having thus explained the meaning of the term ālaya consciousness, its categories, its definitions, its substance and characteristics, and its distinctions, the author now raises a question and answers it in order to show that it is in conformity with correct practice.
['ZH_T31_1598_003:0398c02_19']	何因緣等無覆無記者，是無染無記義，由異熟果等辨無記因緣。	何因緣等無覆無記者，是無染無記義，由異熟果等辨無記因緣。	What are the causes and conditions, etc., of the indeterminate, morally neutral ālaya consciousness? It is free from defilement and is called neutral because of its nature as retribution, etc.
['ZH_T31_1598_003:0398c04_15']	無覆無記與善不善互不相違者，是共依故，作無間業等、世間離欲等皆同有故。	無覆無記與善不善互不相違者，是共依故，作無間業等、世間離欲等皆同有故。	It is morally neutral and indeterminate because it is not in opposition to the good or the nongood. It is the common support of all dharmas, and it is the same in all its activities, such as creating an interval between itself and other acts, etc., and in worldly detachment, etc.
['ZH_T31_1598_003:0398c05_15']	是故異熟識非善不善，勿與此二因果相違。	是故異熟識非善不善，勿與此二因果相違。	Therefore the consciousness as retribution is neither good nor bad, in order to avoid the error of contradicting the two, cause and effect, of good and bad.
