['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b16_13']	謂初二三四。	謂初二三四。	077	They are called the first, second, third, and fourth.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b17_6']	豈諸靜慮無如慈等不共名想。	豈諸靜慮無如慈等不共名想。	077	Are there no names and concepts unique to the dhyānas, such as universal goodwill, etc.?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b18_1']	而今但說初等四數建立別名。	而今但說初等四數建立別名。	077	But now we only speak of the establishment of the separate names of first, etc., on the basis of number.

['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b19_8']	以諸靜慮各有二種。	以諸靜慮各有二種。	077	Because the various dhyānas are each of two kinds.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b19_17']	謂定及生有差別故。	謂定及生有差別故。	077	There is a distinction between samādhi and birth.

['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b20_16']	謂第四八前三各三。	謂第四八前三各三。	077	The fourth has eight parts, and the first three each have three parts.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b21_6']	無有別名總詮一地。	無有別名總詮一地。	077	There is no separate name that generally refers to one stage.

['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b23_4']	心一境性以善等持為自性故。	心一境性以善等持為自性故。	077	Because the nature of one-pointedness of mind is that of good samādhi.

['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b24_3']	此二既同難知差別。	此二既同難知差別。	077	Since these two are the same, it is difficult to know their distinction.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b24_12']	相雖無別而地有異。	相雖無別而地有異。	077	Although their characteristics are not different, the stages are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b25_2']	為顯地異就數標名。	為顯地異就數標名。	077	In order to show the difference in stages, we give them names based on number.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b25_11']	故說為初乃至第四。	故說為初乃至第四。	077	Therefore they are called the first, up to the fourth.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b26_1']	此中經主自興問答：	此中經主自興問答：	077	Here the author of the treatise himself raises questions and answers:
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b26_7']	何名一境性？	何名一境性？	077	What is called one-pointedness of mind?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b26_13']	謂專一所緣。	謂專一所緣。	077	It means being focused on a single object.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756b28_2']	彼答非理，眼意二識若同一所緣，應名一境性，故於此處應求別理。	彼答非理，眼意二識若同一所緣，應名一境性，故於此處應求別理。	077	His answer is unreasonable, because if the two consciousnesses of the eye and mind have the same object, they should be called one-pointedness of mind. Therefore, in this case, one should seek a different principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c01_2']	謂若依止一所依根、專一所緣名一境性，豈不一念無易所緣，應一切心中皆有一境性？	謂若依止一所依根、專一所緣名一境性，豈不一念無易所緣，應一切心中皆有一境性？	077	It means that if they rely on the same dominant faculty and are focused on a single object, it is called one-pointedness of mind. Wouldn't it be that in a single moment without changing the object, one-pointedness of mind would exist in all minds?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c02_1']	理實皆有，一一剎那心心所法一境轉故。	理實皆有，一一剎那心心所法一境轉故。	077	In reality, it exists in all [minds], because in each moment, the mind and mental factors operate on a single object.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c04_1']	然非一切皆得定名，以於此中說一境性，但為顯示由勝等持令善心心所相續而轉故。	然非一切皆得定名，以於此中說一境性，但為顯示由勝等持令善心心所相續而轉故。	077	However, not all [minds] are given the name samādhi, because in this context, one-pointedness of mind is explained only to show that by means of superior samādhi, it causes the good mind and mental factors to continue to operate.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c05_17']	若爾，即心依一根轉，引緣自境餘心續生，此即名為心一境性，應離心外無別等持。	若爾，即心依一根轉，引緣自境餘心續生，此即名為心一境性，應離心外無別等持。	077	If that is so, then the mind operates relying on a single faculty, and by attracting its own object, the other mind continues to arise. This is called one-pointedness of mind. There should be no samādhi apart from the mind.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c07_6']	此難不然，前已說故，謂先廣辯心所法中，已辯等持離心別有。	此難不然，前已說故，謂先廣辯心所法中，已辯等持離心別有。	077	This objection is not reasonable, because it has already been explained previously. In the extensive discussion of mental activities, we have already explained that samādhi exists separately from mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c08_14']	謂若心體即三摩地，令心作等亦應無別，差別因緣不可得故。	謂若心體即三摩地，令心作等亦應無別，差別因緣不可得故。	077	If the essence of mind is samādhi, and if it causes the mind to be even, then it should not exist separately, because the reason for the distinction cannot be found.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c09_13']	如是等難具顯如前，故非即心名三摩地。	如是等難具顯如前，故非即心名三摩地。	077	Difficulties such as these are fully revealed as above, and therefore samādhi is not called mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c10_4']	依何義故立靜慮名？	依何義故立靜慮名？	077	On the basis of what meaning is the name samādhi established?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c10_16']	由依此寂靜，方能審慮故。	由依此寂靜，方能審慮故。	077	Because one relies on this tranquility in order to be able to examine and consider,
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c11_17']	審慮即是實了知義，如說心在定，能如實了知。	審慮即是實了知義，如說心在定，能如實了知。	077	and to examine and consider is the meaning of to really understand. It is said that when the mind is in samādhi, it is able to really understand.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c12_18']	審慮義中置地界故，此論宗審慮，定以慧為體。	審慮義中置地界故，此論宗審慮，定以慧為體。	077	The meaning of to examine and consider is placed in the realm of earth, and therefore the principle of this treatise is that samādhi is essentially discernment.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c13_8']	依訓釋理，此是凝寂。	依訓釋理，此是凝寂。	077	According to the principle of etymological interpretation, this is the place of tranquil and still
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c14_7']	思度境處得靜慮名，定令慧生，無濁亂故。	思度境處得靜慮名，定令慧生，無濁亂故。	077	consideration of objects, and it obtains the name samādhi, because samādhi causes discernment to be born, and because it is without turbidity or confusion.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c14_10']	有說：	有說：	077	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c15_5']	此定持勝遍緣如理思惟故名靜慮。	此定持勝遍緣如理思惟故名靜慮。	077	This samādhi is called samādhi because it holds the superior and universally considers objects in accordance with principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c17_5']	勝言簡欲界，遍緣簡無色，如理思惟簡異顛倒，能持此定是妙等持，此妙等持名為靜慮。	勝言簡欲界，遍緣簡無色，如理思惟簡異顛倒，能持此定是妙等持，此妙等持名為靜慮。	077	The word “excellent” excludes the realm of desire, “universal object” excludes the formless realm, and “correct reflection” excludes erroneous inversion. The samādhi that supports this samādhi is called “excellent samādhi.” This excellent samādhi is called dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c18_4']	此言顯示止觀均行無倒等持方名靜慮。	此言顯示止觀均行無倒等持方名靜慮。	077	This statement shows that only samādhi that is neither quiescence nor insight, that is neither inverted nor erroneous, is called dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c18_14']	若爾，染污寧得此名？	若爾，染污寧得此名？	077	If this is so, how can the defiled obtain this name?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c19_3']	由彼亦能邪審慮故。	由彼亦能邪審慮故。	077	Because they are also able to wrongly reflect.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c20_11']	於相似處亦立此名，如世間言朽敗種等，故無一切名靜慮失。	於相似處亦立此名，如世間言朽敗種等，故無一切名靜慮失。	077	This name is established in a similar place, just as the world says “rotten seeds,” etc. Therefore there is no error in calling all dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c21_18']	若善性攝心一境性并伴立為四靜慮者，依何相立初二三四？	若善性攝心一境性并伴立為四靜慮者，依何相立初二三四？	077	If the one-pointedness of mind included in the wholesome is established as the four dhyānas together with its associates, on what characteristics are the first, second, third, and fourth established?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c23_16']	具伺喜樂建立為初，謂若位中善一境性具與尋伺喜樂相應，如是等持名初靜慮。	具伺喜樂建立為初，謂若位中善一境性具與尋伺喜樂相應，如是等持名初靜慮。	077	It is established as the first, in which there is initial inquiry, joy, and pleasure. That is to say, in this state, wholesome one-pointedness of mind is associated with initial inquiry, investigation, joy, and pleasure. Such samādhi is called the first dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c25_14']	頌中但說與伺相應，已顯與尋亦相應義，以若有伺與喜樂俱，必無與尋不相應故。	頌中但說與伺相應，已顯與尋亦相應義，以若有伺與喜樂俱，必無與尋不相應故。	077	The verse only speaks of being associated with applied thought, but this already shows the meaning of being associated with sustained thought, because if there is sustained thought, it must be associated with applied thought, and it must be accompanied by joy and pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c27_3']	為顯第二除伺建立，故頌但說具伺非尋，異此應言具尋喜樂。	為顯第二除伺建立，故頌但說具伺非尋，異此應言具尋喜樂。	077	In order to show the second establishment, which excludes sustained thought, the verse only speaks of being accompanied by sustained thought but not by applied thought. If it were different from this, it should be said to be accompanied by applied thought, joy, and pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c27_13']	舉尋有伺，不說自成。	舉尋有伺，不說自成。	077	Raising applied thought and sustained thought, it is not said to be accomplished by itself.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c29_10']	漸離前支立二三四，離伺有二、離二有樂，具離三種如其次第，故一境性分為四種。	漸離前支立二三四，離伺有二、離二有樂，具離三種如其次第，故一境性分為四種。	077	Establishing the second, third, and fourth by gradually abandoning the previous limbs, abandoning sustained thought has two, abandoning the two has pleasure, and completely abandoning the three kinds is called the four kinds of one-pointed concentration in order.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c29_15']	已辯靜慮。	已辯靜慮。	077	The dhyānas have already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0756c29_20']	無色云何？	無色云何？	077	What about the formless [absorptions]?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a01_2']	頌曰：	頌曰：	077	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a02_0']	無色亦如是，　　四蘊離下地，	無色亦如是，　　四蘊離下地，	077	The formless [absorptions] are also like this, the four aggregates apart from the lower stages,
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a03_13']	并上三近分，　　總名除色想。	并上三近分，　　總名除色想。	077	And the three upper preliminary concentrations, in total called eliminating the notion of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a04_0']	無色謂無色，　　後色起從心，	無色謂無色，　　後色起從心，	077	The formless [absorptions] are called formless, the subsequent arising of form comes from the mind,
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a05_0']	空無邊等三，　　名從加行立，	空無邊等三，　　名從加行立，	077	The three beginning with infinite space, their names are established from the preparatory stage,
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a06_13']	非想非非想，　　昧劣故立名。	非想非非想，　　昧劣故立名。	077	Non-perception and non-non-perception are named after their dull and inferior states.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a07_2']	論曰：	論曰：	077	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a07_11']	此與靜慮數自性同。	此與靜慮數自性同。	077	The number of natures of these [formless concentrations] is the same as the concentrations.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a08_10']	謂四各二，生如前說，即世品說由生有四。	謂四各二，生如前說，即世品說由生有四。	077	That is to say, each has two, and their arising is as previously explained. The chapter on the world says that they arise in four ways.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a09_17']	定無色體，總而言之亦善性攝心一境性，依此故說亦如是言。	定無色體，總而言之亦善性攝心一境性，依此故說亦如是言。	077	The essence of the formless concentrations, in general terms, is also categorized as the wholesome nature of the one-pointedness of mind. Based on this, it says the same is true.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a10_16']	然助伴中此除色蘊，無色無有隨轉色故。	然助伴中此除色蘊，無色無有隨轉色故。	077	However, in their accompanying factors, these [formless concentrations] exclude the aggregate of form, because there is no form that accompanies the formless [realms].
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a11_15']	雖一境性并伴無差，離下地生故分四種。	雖一境性并伴無差，離下地生故分四種。	077	Although the one-pointedness of mind and its accompanying factors are without distinction, they are divided into four kinds because they are born apart from the lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a13_10']	謂若已離第四靜慮生立空無邊處，乃至已離無所有處生立非想非非想處。	謂若已離第四靜慮生立空無邊處，乃至已離無所有處生立非想非非想處。	077	That is to say, if one is already born apart from the fourth concentration, one establishes the sphere of infinite space, and so on, up to if one is already born apart from the sphere of nothingness, one establishes the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a13_15']	離名何義？	離名何義？	077	What is the meaning of apart from?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a14_12']	謂由此道解脫下地惑，是離下染義。	謂由此道解脫下地惑，是離下染義。	077	It means that by this path one is liberated from the passions of the lower stages. This is the meaning of being apart from the defilements of the lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a15_13']	即此四根本并上三近分，總說名為除去色想。	即此四根本并上三近分，總說名為除去色想。	077	These four fundamental [formless concentrations] and the three proximate formless concentrations above are generally referred to as removing the notion of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a17_4']	空處近分未得此名，緣下地色起色想故，非緣下色想可立除色名。	空處近分未得此名，緣下地色起色想故，非緣下色想可立除色名。	077	The preliminary concentration of the sphere of infinite space is not given this name because it produces the notion of form in regard to the form of the lower stage. The notion of form cannot be said to be eliminated in regard to the form of the lower stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a18_3']	若爾，何緣大種蘊說除去色想是第四定？	若爾，何緣大種蘊說除去色想是第四定？	077	In that case, why does the Mahāyāna Saṃgīti Sūtra say, “The elimination of the notion of form is the fourth concentration”?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a20_10']	彼緣欲界住自身中，所有諸色漸除去故，非無色界可有此想，是除色想前加行故，立根本名亦無有失。	彼緣欲界住自身中，所有諸色漸除去故，非無色界可有此想，是除色想前加行故，立根本名亦無有失。	077	Because one eliminates the form that exists in one’s own body in the desire realm. The notion of form does not exist in the formless realm. Because it is a preliminary stage, it is called the elimination of the notion of form. There is no error in calling it a fundamental stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a20_19']	依何義故立無色名？	依何義故立無色名？	077	On the basis of what meaning is the name formless realm established?
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a21_17']	魯波言顯可變示義，依可變示說名為色。	魯波言顯可變示義，依可變示說名為色。	077	The word rūpa indicates that which can be transformed and demonstrated. It is said that form is that which can be transformed and demonstrated.
['ZH_T29_1562_077:0757a23_15']	阿言即顯能制約義，為欲顯示生死海中亦有暫時制約色處，依制約義說名為無。	阿言即顯能制約義，為欲顯示生死海中亦有暫時制約色處，依制約義說名為無。	077	The word a indicates that which can be restrained. In order to show that in the ocean of saṃsāra there is also a temporary restraint of the form realm, the meaning of restraint is relied upon to say that it is formless.

['ZH_T29_1562_077:0761a02_3']	無違經過，由此經中所說樂言是樂根故，非此經內立靜慮支總說能修初定五法。	無違經過，由此經中所說樂言是樂根故，非此經內立靜慮支總說能修初定五法。	077	There is no contradiction with the scriptures, because in this scripture the word “pleasure” refers to the faculty of pleasure. It is not the case that this scripture establishes the members of the first trance as the five dharmas that are cultivated in general.
