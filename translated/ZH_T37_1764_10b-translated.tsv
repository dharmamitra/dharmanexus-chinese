['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a10_12']	一正其喻相。	一正其喻相。	First, clarifying the characteristics of the analogy.
['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a12_1']	「是喻亦說即炷有明、離炷有明」，炷增明增、炷枯明滅，名之為即；	「是喻亦說即炷有明、離炷有明」，炷增明增、炷枯明滅，名之為即；	This analogy also says that the light is both on the wick and separate from the wick - the wick increases and the light increases, the wick dries up and the light extinguishes, which is called both;
['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a12_15']	明遍室中亦在炷邊，說之為離。	明遍室中亦在炷邊，說之為離。	The light illuminates throughout the room and is also at the edge of the wick, so it is said to be separate.
['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a13_13']	舉此即離為取即義，破彼先尼我與法異。	舉此即離為取即義，破彼先尼我與法異。	Citing this as being both the same and separate is to refute the earlier argument of Sāṃkhya that the self is different from dharmas.
['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a14_4']	二「汝心不」下，准喻呵責。	二「汝心不」下，准喻呵責。	Second, below Your mind is not, it uses the analogy to reprimand.

Your mind is not equal, unilaterally establishing difference. The analogy of the wick being separate illustrates dharmas and non-dharmas, and the difference in light illustrates the self.
['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a17_13']	三「是故」下，如來重復顯已責意，是汝不等偏執離故，我今責汝即炷有明、離炷有明。	三「是故」下，如來重復顯已責意，是汝不等偏執離故，我今責汝即炷有明、離炷有明。	Third, below Therefore, the Tathāgata again reveals his intention in reprimanding. Since you are not equal and unilaterally grasp at separation, I now reprimand you, saying that the light is both the same as and separate from the wick.
['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a18_6']	「即離有明」，是初句中即離之喻。	「即離有明」，是初句中即離之喻。	The light being both the same and separate is the analogy of being both the same and separate in the first sentence.

['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a19_10']	喻中既有即炷有明，法亦應爾。	喻中既有即炷有明，法亦應爾。	In the analogy, there is indeed the light being the same as the wick. The dharma should also be so.
['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a20_9']	法即有我、我即有法，非法即我、我即非法。	法即有我、我即有法，非法即我、我即非法。	Dharmas are the same as the self, the self is the same as dharmas. Dharmas are not the self, the self is not dharmas.

['ZH_T37_1764_10b:0897a22_7']	准喻推法，法中亦有即離之義，汝今何故但受離邊、不受即邊？	准喻推法，法中亦有即離之義，汝今何故但受離邊、不受即邊？	According to the analogy, the Dharma also has the meaning of being both identical and different. Why do you now only accept the side of difference and not accept the side of identity?
