['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b07_18']	身蜜合故　婆沙有說。	身蜜合故　婆沙有說。	022	Because the body and breath are combined. The Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra says:
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b09_10']	無四事者非是正義　言身在欲．初．二．三定入無色定息不轉者。	無四事者非是正義　言身在欲．初．二．三定入無色定息不轉者。	022	Those who say there are no four things are not of the orthodox school. As for those in the desire realm, first, second, and third dhyānas entering the formless concentrations, the breath does not move.

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b12_14']	息有情數攝有情身分故．者。	息有情數攝有情身分故．者。	022	As for the breath being categorized as sentient, because it is a part of the sentient body,
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b13_2']	釋頌情數。	釋頌情數。	022	It explains the verse on being categorized as sentient.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b13_12']	即第三情．非情門也。	即第三情．非情門也。	022	This is the third gate on sentient and non-sentient.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b14_2']	有情身分故唯有情數。	有情身分故唯有情數。	022	Because it is a part of the sentient body, it is only categorized as sentient.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b14_7']	故正理云。	故正理云。	022	Therefore the Nyāyapraveśa says:
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b14_17']	此入．出息有情數收。	此入．出息有情數收。	022	This inhalation and exhalation is categorized as sentient.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b15_5']	無覺身中息無有故。	無覺身中息無有故。	022	Because in the body without thought, the breath does not exist.

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b17_18']	由離根故非有執受。	由離根故非有執受。	022	Because they are separated from the sense faculties, they are not appropriated.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b18_4']	故正理云。	故正理云。	022	Therefore the correct principle says:
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b18_13']	此入出息非有執受。	此入出息非有執受。	022	These inhalations and exhalations are not appropriated.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b19_4']	以息闕減執受相故。	以息闕減執受相故。	022	Because the characteristics of appropriation are lacking in the breath.

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b22_7']	同類因生故是等流性　非所長養。	同類因生故是等流性　非所長養。	022	Because it is born from the homogeneous cause, it is the nature of outflow. It is not nourished.

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342c03_17']	息隨身繫初定攝故。	息隨身繫初定攝故。	022	Because the breath is bound to the body and is included in the first concentration.
