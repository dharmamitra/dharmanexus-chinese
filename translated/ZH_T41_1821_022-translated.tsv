['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b14_2']	有情身分故唯有情數。	有情身分故唯有情數。	Because it is a part of the sentient body, it is only categorized as sentient.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b14_7']	故正理云。	故正理云。	Therefore the Nyāyapraveśa says:

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b22_7']	同類因生故是等流性　非所長養。	同類因生故是等流性　非所長養。	Because it is born from the homogeneous cause, it is the nature of outflow. It is not nourished.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b22_16']	身肥大時息損減故。	身肥大時息損減故。	When the body becomes fat and large, the breath decreases.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342b23_11']	身瘦少時息增長故　非異熟生。	身瘦少時息增長故　非異熟生。	When the body becomes thin and small, the breath increases. It is not born from karmic ripening.

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342c02_13']	若生初定唯起欲界通果心。	若生初定唯起欲界通果心。	If one is born in the first concentration, one only gives rise to the supernormal power mind of the desire realm.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342c03_8']	然通果心唯緣自地所變化事。	然通果心唯緣自地所變化事。	However, the supernormal power mind only takes as its object the transformed events of its own ground.
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342c03_17']	息隨身繫初定攝故。	息隨身繫初定攝故。	Because the breath is bound to the body and is included in the first concentration.

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342c06_8']	若生二定以上起初定威儀心發上地威儀業。	若生二定以上起初定威儀心發上地威儀業。	If one is born above the second concentration and gives rise to the deportment mind of the first concentration, one gives rise to the deportment karma of the upper ground.

['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342c08_6']	非下地威儀心所緣。	非下地威儀心所緣。	The minds of deportment of lower stages do not take it as an object.

As for the explanation that after the mind of deportment, it is successively taken as an object of the twelve sense bases,
['ZH_T41_1821_022:0342c10_13']	唯緣自地不緣上地。	唯緣自地不緣上地。	it only takes as objects its own stage and does not take as objects higher stages.
