['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a13_0']	謂於真法身，　　無隨好圓滿，	謂於真法身，　　無隨好圓滿，	003	It means that in the true Dharma body, there is no perfection of minor marks,
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a14_13']	亦非是具相，　　非身性應知。	亦非是具相，　　非身性應知。	003	And also it is not endowed with characteristics, one should know that it is not of the nature of a body.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a15_0']	於法身無別，　　非如來無二，	於法身無別，　　非如來無二，	003	In the Dharma body there is no distinction, the Tathāgata is not without duality,
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a16_13']	重言其具相，　　由二體皆無。	重言其具相，　　由二體皆無。	003	The repeated phrase endowed with characteristics is because both natures are non-existent.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a18_17']	言法身實不圓滿隨好色身，應知亦不具足眾相，彼無身性故，是謂法身無具相義。	言法身實不圓滿隨好色身，應知亦不具足眾相，彼無身性故，是謂法身無具相義。	003	It is said that the Dharma body is truly not perfect in the minor marks and the form body, and one should also know that it is not fully endowed with the major marks, because it is not of the nature of a body. This is called the meaning of the Dharma body not being endowed with characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a20_16']	亦非如來無斯二種，所謂色身圓滿及以具相，由斯二種不離法身，是故如來有其相好。	亦非如來無斯二種，所謂色身圓滿及以具相，由斯二種不離法身，是故如來有其相好。	003	It is not that the Tathāgata lacks these two kinds, namely the perfect physical body and the complete major and minor marks, because these two are inseparable from the Dharma body. Therefore, the Tathāgata has those major and minor marks.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a22_6']	為此重言色身圓滿及以具相，由二皆無故，是故此二亦說為無。	為此重言色身圓滿及以具相，由二皆無故，是故此二亦說為無。	003	For this reason, the text repeats the perfect physical body and the complete major and minor marks. Because both are nonexistent, therefore these two are also said to be nonexistent.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a23_15']	言此非圓滿此亦非具相，亦說為有，以說色身圓滿及具相言故。	言此非圓滿此亦非具相，亦說為有，以說色身圓滿及具相言故。	003	It is said that this is not perfect and this also lacks the complete major and minor marks, and it is also said to exist, because the words the perfect physical body and the complete major and minor marks are used.

['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a25_16']	由其法身無此相好，是故名此為如來，色身圓滿及以具相，由與彼身不相離故；	由其法身無此相好，是故名此為如來，色身圓滿及以具相，由與彼身不相離故；	003	Because the Dharma body lacks these major and minor marks, it is called the Tathāgata's perfect physical body and complete major and minor marks, because it is inseparable from that body;
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a26_15']	法身之性即不如是，然法身非彼自性故。	法身之性即不如是，然法身非彼自性故。	003	The nature of the Dharma body is not like this, but because the Dharma body is not their intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a28_6']	若言不應以色身圓滿及具相身觀如來者，如何如來有所說法耶？	若言不應以色身圓滿及具相身觀如來者，如何如來有所說法耶？	003	If it is said that one should not view the Tathāgata in terms of the perfect physical body and the body complete with the major and minor marks, then how does the Tathāgata have any Dharma to speak?
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882a29_13']	為答斯難，此即以其惡取而謗於我，由不能解我所說義故。	為答斯難，此即以其惡取而謗於我，由不能解我所說義故。	003	To answer this difficulty, this [criticism] is a case of misapprehending and slandering me, because [the critic] does not understand the meaning of what I have said.

['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882b05_13']	由不離法界，　　說亦無自性。	由不離法界，　　說亦無自性。	003	Because of not being apart from the Dharma realm, speaking also has no intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882b06_13']	由不離法界外有說法自性可得。	由不離法界外有說法自性可得。	003	Because apart from the Dharma realm there is no speaking that can be obtained.
['ZH_T25_1513_003:0882b08_3']	若言無有世尊是能說者，所說之法亦復不離法身，故成非有。	若言無有世尊是能說者，所說之法亦復不離法身，故成非有。	003	If it is said that there is no World-Honored One who is the speaker, the Dharma that is spoken is also not apart from the Dharma body, and therefore it is not existent.
