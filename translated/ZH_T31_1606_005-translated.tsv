Because the arising of the same and different types of mind and mental factors is without interval, this is the meaning of the similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T31_1606_005:0714a13_16']	中無間隔等無間者，不必剎那中無間隔，雖隔剎那但於中間無異心隔，亦名中無間隔。	中無間隔等無間者，不必剎那中無間隔，雖隔剎那但於中間無異心隔，亦名中無間隔。	005	No interruption in the middle does not necessarily mean no interval in a single moment. Even if there is an interval in a single moment, as long as there is no other mind interrupting in the middle, it is also called no interruption in the middle.
['ZH_T31_1606_005:0714a14_18']	若不爾，入無心定心望出定心，應非等無間緣。	若不爾，入無心定心望出定心，應非等無間緣。	005	If it were not so, the mind entering the state of no-mind would not be the similar and immediately antecedent condition for the mind leaving the state of concentration.
['ZH_T31_1606_005:0714a16_11']	然是彼緣，是故於一相續中前心望後心，中間無餘心隔故，是等無間緣。	然是彼緣，是故於一相續中前心望後心，中間無餘心隔故，是等無間緣。	005	However, it is that condition. Therefore, in a single continuum, the preceding mind is the similar and immediately antecedent condition for the subsequent mind because there is no other mind interrupting in the middle.
['ZH_T31_1606_005:0714a17_3']	如心望心，當知心法亦爾。	如心望心，當知心法亦爾。	005	Just as the mind is for the mind, one should understand that mental factors are also like this.

['ZH_T31_1606_005:0714a20_14']	如是不善、無記心心法望同分異分，無間生心心法亦爾。	如是不善、無記心心法望同分異分，無間生心心法亦爾。	005	Unvirtuous and indeterminate mind and mental factors are also like this, giving rise to mind and mental factors of the same and different types in immediate succession.

['ZH_T31_1606_005:0714a24_4']	如是色界等心心法各各別望色界等及欲界等，無間生心心法，如其所應盡當知。	如是色界等心心法各各別望色界等及欲界等，無間生心心法，如其所應盡當知。	005	Mind and mental factors of the form realm, etc. each give rise to mind and mental factors of the form realm, etc. and the desire realm, etc. in immediate succession, as appropriate. This should be fully understood.
