['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272b18_0', 'ZH_T38_1772_001:0272b19_0']	大慈恩寺基撰🔽原夫性質杳冥、超蹄象而含總，覺體玄眇、絕	大慈恩寺基撰 原夫性質杳冥、超蹄象而含總，覺體玄眇、絕	Composed by Jizang of the Great Ci'en Monastery
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272b21_13']	視聽而融貫，方智雲法縠月、察神理而猶迷，假慧仞於叢筠、揆靈機而不測。	視聽而融貫，方智雲法縠月、察神理而猶迷，假慧仞於叢筠、揆靈機而不測。	The nature is profound and mysterious, transcending form and substance while encompassing the totality. The essence of enlightenment is profound and vast, transcending sight and hearing while unifying all. When one observes the spiritual principles with the clouds of wisdom and the moon of the Dharma, one is still confused. Even if one borrows the height of wisdom from the bamboo grove, one cannot fathom the spiritual mechanism.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272b27_4']	至道圓而粹容顯、實際彰而真識淨，然後俯提十地、疎海目於寶方，下控三乘、挺仙儀於垢城，若鴻鍾之虛受、應物扣以騰聲，譬晈魄以澂暉、循器清而肆影，故有紹隆報佛即灌頂於甄臺、纂業化身先貽神於紺殿，撫根熟而趨座、待生機而降跡。	至道圓而粹容顯、實際彰而真識淨，然後俯提十地、疎海目於寶方，下控三乘、挺仙儀於垢城，若鴻鍾之虛受、應物扣以騰聲，譬晈魄以澂暉、循器清而肆影，故有紹隆報佛即灌頂於甄臺、纂業化身先貽神於紺殿，撫根熟而趨座、待生機而降跡。	When the perfect Way is realized and the pure countenance is revealed, when the ultimate reality is manifested and the true consciousness is purified, then one can look down on the ten grounds and see the ocean-like eyes in the jeweled palace, and look down on the three vehicles and see the immortal form in the defiled city. It is like a great bell that is empty and receptive, responding to the striking of objects to produce sound. It is like the clear light of the bright moon, following the purity of vessels to cast reflections. Therefore, there are those who continue the Buddha's teachings and receive the consecration in the jeweled hall, and those who compile the Buddha's work and first bestow the spirit in the purple palace. They comfort the ripe faculties and approach the seat, waiting for the spiritual mechanism to descend.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272b28_5']	斯乃三際受職之宏儀、一生補處之靈範者也。	斯乃三際受職之宏儀、一生補處之靈範者也。	This is the grand ceremony of receiving the position in the three periods of time, and the spiritual model of the one who is to be reborn in the Tuṣita Heaven and attain Buddhahood in the next life.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272b29_18']	今此經者，灑群萌之一雨、濟眾獸之通津，運弱喪之大舟、引炎童之妙輪。	今此經者，灑群萌之一雨、濟眾獸之通津，運弱喪之大舟、引炎童之妙輪。	This sutra is like a single rain that moistens all sprouts, a common ford that benefits all animals, a great ship that transports the weak and suffering, and a wonderful wheel that guides the young.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c05_1']	雖復探幽曉祕、歸乎異線之華，然而拯溺符機、寔在此筌之葉，所以金光夕燭、旗有景於昏徒，芳蘤前霧、表無虧於後實，妙祥之儔波萎、鶖子之輩雲趨，雖則稟訓一時，實乃津梁千祀。	雖復探幽曉祕、歸乎異線之華，然而拯溺符機、寔在此筌之葉，所以金光夕燭、旗有景於昏徒，芳蘤前霧、表無虧於後實，妙祥之儔波萎、鶖子之輩雲趨，雖則稟訓一時，實乃津梁千祀。	Although it explores the profound and understands the secrets, it returns to the beauty of different lines, it rescues the drowning and conforms to the opportunity, and it is truly in the leaves of this fishing net. Therefore, the golden light shines in the evening, and there is a scene of flags in the dark crowd. The fragrant flowers are like the morning mist, and there is no loss of the future reality. The companions of wonderful auspiciousness wither like waves, and the group of Śāriputra clouds rush. Although they receive the teachings for a while, they truly become the bridge and ferry for a thousand years.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c07_1']	若夫天宮聖境資莫限之因嚴、覺苑神幾叶無彊之德履，匪心樞而攬觀，豈語極之揚光？	若夫天宮聖境資莫限之因嚴、覺苑神幾叶無彊之德履，匪心樞而攬觀，豈語極之揚光？	As for the sacred realm of the heavenly palace, it is adorned with causes that are limitless, and the spiritual realm of the garden of enlightenment is in accord with virtues and practices that are boundless. It is not grasped by the pivot of the mind, and how can it be praised by the ultimate of words?
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c07_11']	教府自陳，題衡息讚。	教府自陳，題衡息讚。	The teaching office itself proclaims, and praises the title of the sutra.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c09_4']	觀彌勒菩薩上生兜率天經者，六事齊修、二因兼積，心勤妙境、欣趣日觀。	觀彌勒菩薩上生兜率天經者，六事齊修、二因兼積，心勤妙境、欣趣日觀。	Those who contemplate the Sutra on Maitreya Bodhisattva's Ascent to Tuṣita Heaven, cultivate six things equally, accumulate two causes together, diligently contemplate the wondrous realm, and joyfully look forward to the sun.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c09_15']	彌勒，梵音，此云慈氏。	彌勒，梵音，此云慈氏。	Maitreya, in Sanskrit, means Compassionate One.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c10_17']	母志悲纏蠢類，子性恤及懷生，宿願今誠俱以標號。	母志悲纏蠢類，子性恤及懷生，宿願今誠俱以標號。	The mother's aspiration is to have compassion for all beings, and the son's nature is to care for and cherish life. Their past vows are now sincere, and they both use this to name themselves.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c11_17']	道圓上果、跡履下因，祈覺運生，假稱菩薩。	道圓上果、跡履下因，祈覺運生，假稱菩薩。	The Way is perfected in the highest fruit, and the traces tread on the lower causes. Praying for enlightenment and bringing forth life, they provisionally call themselves bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c12_2']	上生，即往昇。	上生，即往昇。	Ascent means to go up and ascend.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c12_9']	兜率，言知足。	兜率，言知足。	Tuṣita means contentment.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c12_18']	自在光潔神用名天。	自在光潔神用名天。	Self-mastery, radiance, and spiritual function are called heaven.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c13_18']	此由補處，天宮端居利他，祈心住觀必獲瞻奉。	此由補處，天宮端居利他，祈心住觀必獲瞻奉。	This is because the one who will be the next Buddha is peacefully residing in the heavenly palace benefiting others. Praying with the mind to abide in contemplation, one will surely be able to see and venerate him.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c14_13']	經者，攝也、貫也、常也、法也。	經者，攝也、貫也、常也、法也。	Sutra means to include, to string together, to be constant, and to be the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c16_8']	生資教攝永絕樊籠、理藉文貫長離散滅、百靈常軌千葉良規、利物詮真，目為經也。	生資教攝永絕樊籠、理藉文貫長離散滅、百靈常軌千葉良規、利物詮真，目為經也。	Life is nourished by the teaching to include, forever escaping the cage. Principle relies on the text to string together, long leaving scattering and destruction. The constant standard of a hundred spiritual beings, the good standard of a thousand leaves, the benefit of things and the interpretation of truth, it is called a sutra.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c17_11']	初釋經文，聊以五門分別：	初釋經文，聊以五門分別：	First, explaining the sutra text, I will discuss it in five aspects:
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c19_2']	一佛成權實、二慈氏所因、三時分有殊、四往生難易、五問答料簡。	一佛成權實、二慈氏所因、三時分有殊、四往生難易、五問答料簡。	First, the Buddha's provisional and true teachings; second, the causes of Maitreya; third, the differences in time; fourth, the difficulty of rebirth; fifth, questions and answers.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c21_11']	第一佛成權實者，權謂隨宜接物、實謂究理迬真，佛之身說皆有此二。	第一佛成權實者，權謂隨宜接物、實謂究理迬真，佛之身說皆有此二。	First, regarding the Buddha's provisional and true teachings, provisional means adapting to beings' capacities, while true means investigating principles and nourishing truth. The Buddha's body and teachings both have these two aspects.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c23_20']	只如《法華經》為引不定性，云「唯此一事實，餘二即非真」，顯一乘教為實、二乘教為權，即《涅槃經》半滿教也。	只如《法華經》為引不定性，云「唯此一事實，餘二即非真」，顯一乘教為實、二乘教為權，即《涅槃經》半滿教也。	For example, the Lotus Sutra, in order to attract those of indeterminate nature, says, Only this one thing is true, the other two are not real, revealing the teaching of the One Vehicle as true and the teachings of the Two Vehicles as provisional, which is the half and full teachings of the Nirvana Sutra.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c27_13']	《勝鬘經》中明決定義，云「若如來隨彼意欲而方便說，唯有一乘，無有二乘」，即唯說有一乘為權，說有四乘為實，謂大乘、獨覺、聲聞，及無聞非法眾生以人天善根而成就之。	《勝鬘經》中明決定義，云「若如來隨彼意欲而方便說，唯有一乘，無有二乘」，即唯說有一乘為權，說有四乘為實，謂大乘、獨覺、聲聞，及無聞非法眾生以人天善根而成就之。	In the Śrīmālā-sūtra, the meaning of determination is explained. It says, If the Tathāgata expediently teaches according to their desires, there is only one vehicle, not two vehicles. This means that teaching only one vehicle is provisional, and teaching four vehicles is true. The four vehicles are the Great Vehicle, the Solitary Realizers' Vehicle, the Śrāvakas' Vehicle, and the vehicle of sentient beings without the capacity for the teachings who are guided by the roots of goodness of humans and gods.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c28_4']	教既如是，身亦復然。	教既如是，身亦復然。	Since the teachings are like this, the body is also like this.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0272c29_16']	故《金剛般若經》云「若以色見我、以音聲尋我，彼生履邪斷，不能當見我。	故《金剛般若經》云「若以色見我、以音聲尋我，彼生履邪斷，不能當見我。	Therefore, the Diamond Prajñā-pāramitā-sūtra says, If you see me in form, or seek me in sound, you will go astray and not see the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a01_19']	」彼如來妙體，即導師法身，體不可見，彼識不能識。	」彼如來妙體，即導師法身，體不可見，彼識不能識。	The wondrous body of the Tathāgata is the Dharma body of the guide. The body cannot be seen, and that consciousness cannot cognize it.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a03_19']	其論又云「應化非真佛，彼亦非說法」者，說法不二，取無說離言相，以法身為實、二身為權。	其論又云「應化非真佛，彼亦非說法」者，說法不二，取無說離言相，以法身為實、二身為權。	The treatise also says, The transformed body is not the true Buddha, and he also does not expound the Dharma. Expounding the Dharma is non-dual. Taking the characteristic of non-expounding and transcendence, the Dharma body is taken as true, and the two bodies are taken as provisional.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a04_16']	《法華經》中執糞器而著垢衣，喻權身也；	《法華經》中執糞器而著垢衣，喻權身也；	In the Lotus Sutra, holding a vessel of excrement and wearing a soiled robe is a metaphor for the provisional body;
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a05_9']	現壽量而無邊際，顯實身也。	現壽量而無邊際，顯實身也。	manifesting boundless life span reveals the real body.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a06_1']	此以受用為實、化身為權。	此以受用為實、化身為權。	This takes the enjoyment body as real and the transformation body as provisional.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a06_11']	然此三身，有二四句：	然此三身，有二四句：	However, these three bodies have two sets of four propositions:
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a07_1']	有報非化，謂自受用身。	有報非化，謂自受用身。	There is retribution but not transformation, referring to the body of self-enjoyment.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a07_12']	有化非報，謂現八相身。	有化非報，謂現八相身。	There is transformation but not retribution, referring to the body manifesting the eight appearances.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a09_1']	有報亦化，謂他受用身，多受法樂可言受用，隨機而現可言變化。	有報亦化，謂他受用身，多受法樂可言受用，隨機而現可言變化。	There is both retribution and transformation, referring to the body of other-enjoyment, which can be said to enjoy the Dharma much, and can be said to transform according to capacities.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a09_11']	有非報化，謂佛法身。	有非報化，謂佛法身。	There is neither retribution nor transformation, referring to the Dharma body of the Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a09_16']	復有四句：	復有四句：	There is another set of four propositions:
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a10_5']	有報非化，謂自受用身。	有報非化，謂自受用身。	There is retribution but not transformation, referring to the body of self-enjoyment.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a11_13']	有化非報，謂隨生類六趣化身，長者居士、猿猴鹿馬種種之身。	有化非報，謂隨生類六趣化身，長者居士、猿猴鹿馬種種之身。	There is transformation but not retribution, referring to the transformation bodies of the six destinies that accord with beings, such as the bodies of elders, householders, monkeys, deer, horses, and various other kinds of bodies.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a12_16']	有報亦化，謂他受用及八相身，前變化身亦此句攝。	有報亦化，謂他受用及八相身，前變化身亦此句攝。	There is both retribution and transformation, referring to the body of other-enjoyment and the body manifesting the eight appearances, with the previously mentioned transformation body also included in this proposition.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a13_7']	有非報化，謂佛法身。	有非報化，謂佛法身。	There is that which is neither retribution nor transformation, namely the Dharma body of the Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a14_5']	雖此四句說身不同，權實二德總皆攝盡。	雖此四句說身不同，權實二德總皆攝盡。	Although these four phrases speak of the body differently, the two virtues of provisional and real are all completely included.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a14_10']	略有二種：	略有二種：	There are roughly two kinds:
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a15_16']	一者法身稱實、餘二並權，實者諸法體真，權者事相權迹。	一者法身稱實、餘二並權，實者諸法體真，權者事相權迹。	The first is that the Dharma body is real, and the other two are both provisional. The real refers to the true essence of all dharmas, and the provisional refers to the provisional traces of phenomenal characteristics.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a16_10']	《般若論》云「應化非真佛」等是。	《般若論》云「應化非真佛」等是。	The Treatise on Prajñā says: The responsive transformation is not the true Buddha, and so forth.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a20_4']	二者法身及自受用，唯佛與佛乃能知之，是身之本俱離差別，功德智慧一一無邊，不可以色形量而取，都無分限起盡之相，具真實德、修證實成，非應物現，名之為實。	二者法身及自受用，唯佛與佛乃能知之，是身之本俱離差別，功德智慧一一無邊，不可以色形量而取，都無分限起盡之相，具真實德、修證實成，非應物現，名之為實。	The second is that the Dharma body and the body of personal enjoyment can only be known by the Buddha and other Buddhas. This body is the basis, and both are free from distinctions. Each of the merits and wisdom is boundless, and cannot be grasped by form, size, or limits. It is completely devoid of the characteristics of arising, abiding, and perishing, and is endowed with true virtues, realized through cultivation and actualized. It does not manifest in response to beings, and is therefore called real.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a24_11']	他受用身及八相化身，隨生類所示現身，可令下類皆知見，是身之末，俱有差別，功德智慧非並無邊，可以色心形量而取，然有分限起盡之相、具相狀功德，因利他取起、應物而現，名之為權。	他受用身及八相化身，隨生類所示現身，可令下類皆知見，是身之末，俱有差別，功德智慧非並無邊，可以色心形量而取，然有分限起盡之相、具相狀功德，因利他取起、應物而現，名之為權。	The body of enjoyment for others and the body of transformation with eight characteristics, the body manifested according to the type of beings, can be seen and known by lower types of beings. This body is the end, all having distinctions. Its merits and wisdom are not boundless, and it can be grasped by form and mind. However, it has the characteristics of arising and ceasing within a limited range, and it possesses the merits of characteristics. It arises to benefit others and appears in response to beings, and is called provisional.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a25_9']	故《佛地論》云「佛身有二，一實身、二生身。	故《佛地論》云「佛身有二，一實身、二生身。	Therefore the Buddha Land Treatise says, The Buddha's body has two aspects: one is the true body, and the other is the born body.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a26_7']	」然此實身各居自土，俱遍法界，非方處求。	」然此實身各居自土，俱遍法界，非方處求。	However, this true body each abides in its own land, both pervading the Dharma realm, not to be sought in space and place.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a26_17']	法身本有，諸佛共同。	法身本有，諸佛共同。	The Dharma body originally exists, shared by all Buddhas.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a27_17']	凡由妄䨱、有而不覺，煩惱纏裹，得如來藏名。	凡由妄䨱、有而不覺，煩惱纏裹，得如來藏名。	It is due to false entanglements, existing yet unaware, wrapped in afflictions, and is called the Tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273a29_4']	由近善友、斷妄生死，出纏裹時，具法身之稱，諸功德法所依止。	由近善友、斷妄生死，出纏裹時，具法身之稱，諸功德法所依止。	By relying on good friends, cutting off false birth and death, and emerging from entanglements, it possesses the title of Dharma body, the basis of all meritorious dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b01_12']	故《勝鬘經》中在纏名如來藏、出纏名法身，約位因果得名別故。	故《勝鬘經》中在纏名如來藏、出纏名法身，約位因果得名別故。	Therefore, in the Śrīmālā-sūtra, it is called the tathāgatagarbha when it is in the entangling [afflictions], and it is called the Dharma body when it is free from the entangling [afflictions]. This is because the names are distinguished according to the stages of cause and effect.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b02_16']	但可說證、不可說成，初地以上分亦證得，佛果圓證。	但可說證、不可說成，初地以上分亦證得，佛果圓證。	It can only be said to be realized, not to be accomplished. From the first ground onward, it is partially realized and attained, and at the stage of Buddhahood, it is fully realized.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b03_14']	自受用身新修所起，有情分別事體異故。	自受用身新修所起，有情分別事體異故。	The body of self-enjoyment newly arises from cultivation, because the substance of the objects of sentient beings' discrimination is different.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b05_13']	從凡夫位但有無始無漏種子，由近善友、聽聞正法，種子漸增為報身本，亦名如來藏。	從凡夫位但有無始無漏種子，由近善友、聽聞正法，種子漸增為報身本，亦名如來藏。	From the stage of ordinary beings, there are only beginningless seeds of the uncontaminated [dharmas]. Due to associating with good friends and listening to the true Dharma, the seeds gradually increase and become the basis for the reward body. It is also called the tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b07_5']	《楞伽經》云「阿梨耶識名空如來藏，具足熏習無漏法故名不空如來藏。	《楞伽經》云「阿梨耶識名空如來藏，具足熏習無漏法故名不空如來藏。	The Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra says, The ālaya-vijñāna is called the empty tathāgatagarbha, and because it is fully perfumed by the uncontaminated dharmas, it is called the non-empty tathāgatagarbha.

By the power of this, one causes contaminated wholesome karma to arise, and in the future one will receive the marks and characteristics in full. One is born in the transformation land of the eight appearances. Upon reaching the first ground, one then assists the contaminated and obtains the ten king positions. Life after life, one always obtains the thirty-two marks and eighty minor marks. However, one is still not free from contamination and has not yet fully illuminated.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b13_5']	唯有六七二識無漏，生他受用隨類土中。	唯有六七二識無漏，生他受用隨類土中。	Only the sixth and seventh consciousnesses are free from contamination, and one is born in the land of enjoyment for others according to one's type.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b13_16']	如《梵網經》說位大小。	如《梵網經》說位大小。	As the Brahma Net Sutra says, the stages are large and small.
['ZH_T38_1772_001:0273b16_15']	金剛道後有漏皆滅，無漏五蘊一切圓明，捨無常色獲得常色，受想行識亦復如是，獲得無漏三十二相八十隨好，盡未來際相依相續。	金剛道後有漏皆滅，無漏五蘊一切圓明，捨無常色獲得常色，受想行識亦復如是，獲得無漏三十二相八十隨好，盡未來際相依相續。	After the Diamond Path, all contamination ceases, and the five aggregates free from contamination are all fully illuminated. One abandons impermanent form and obtains permanent form, and feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness are also like this. One obtains the thirty-two marks free from contamination and the eighty minor marks. One continues in this way until the end of the future.
