['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024b16_7']	若生無想有情天中，有法能令心心所滅，名為無想。	若生無想有情天中，有法能令心心所滅，名為無想。	005	If one is born in the heaven of non-perceiving sentient beings, there is a dharma that can cause the mind and mental factors to cease, called non-perception.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024b17_11']	是實有物，能遮未來心心所法令暫不起，如堰江河。	是實有物，能遮未來心心所法令暫不起，如堰江河。	005	It is a real entity that can block future minds and mental factors, causing them to temporarily not arise, like a dam blocking a river.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024b22_14']	如契經說：	如契經說：	005	As a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024b26_8']	彼諸有情由想起故從彼處沒，然彼有情如久睡覺還起於想，從彼沒已必生欲界非餘處所，先修定行勢力盡故、於彼不能更修定故，如箭射空力盡便墮。	彼諸有情由想起故從彼處沒，然彼有情如久睡覺還起於想，從彼沒已必生欲界非餘處所，先修定行勢力盡故、於彼不能更修定故，如箭射空力盡便墮。	005	Those sentient beings, due to the arising of thought, fall from that place. However, those sentient beings, like one who has slept for a long time and then awakens, still have thought. Having fallen from there, they definitely are reborn in the desire realm, not in other places, because the power of their previously cultivated concentration practices is exhausted and they are unable to further cultivate concentration there, like an arrow shot into the sky that falls when its power is exhausted.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024b27_8']	若諸有情應生彼處，必有欲界順後受業。	若諸有情應生彼處，必有欲界順後受業。	005	If sentient beings are to be born in that place, they must have karma of the desire realm that will produce results in a later life.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024b28_8']	如應生彼北俱盧洲，必定應有生天之業。	如應生彼北俱盧洲，必定應有生天之業。	005	It is like those who are to be born in the Uttarakuru continent, who must definitely have karma that will produce rebirth in the heavens.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024b29_8']	謂無想定及滅盡定。	謂無想定及滅盡定。	005	They are the meditative absorption of non-perception and the meditative absorption of cessation.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c02_13']	善唯順生受，　　非聖得一世。	善唯順生受，　　非聖得一世。	005	is wholesome, only produces results in the next life, is not noble, and is attained for one life.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c03_2']	論曰：	論曰：	005	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c05_2']	如前所說有法能令心心所滅名為無想，如是復有別法能令心心所滅名無想定。	如前所說有法能令心心所滅名為無想，如是復有別法能令心心所滅名無想定。	005	As explained above, there is a dharma that can cause the cessation of mind and mental factors called the mindless state. Similarly, there is another dharma that can cause the cessation of mind and mental factors called the meditative absorption of non-perception.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c06_2']	無想者定名無想定，或定無想名無想定。	無想者定名無想定，或定無想名無想定。	005	The meditative absorption of non-perception is called the meditative absorption of non-perception because it is a meditative absorption in which there is no perception, or because it is a meditative absorption that is non-perception.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c07_2']	說如是聲，唯顯此定滅心心所與無想同。	說如是聲，唯顯此定滅心心所與無想同。	005	The word like only shows that this meditative absorption, in terms of the cessation of mind and mental factors, is the same as the mindless state.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c08_11']	修無想定為何所求？	修無想定為何所求？	005	For what is the seeking of the cultivation of the attainment of non-perception?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c08_16']	謂求解脫。	謂求解脫。	005	It is the seeking of liberation.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c09_16']	彼執無想是真解脫，為求證彼修無想定。	彼執無想是真解脫，為求證彼修無想定。	005	They grasp non-perception as true liberation, and cultivate the attainment of non-perception in order to realize it.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c10_17']	前說無想是異熟故，無記性攝，不說自成。	前說無想是異熟故，無記性攝，不說自成。	005	Previously, it was said that the attainment of non-perception is the retribution of karma, so it is categorized as indeterminate. It is not necessary to explain this again.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c12_6']	今無想定一向是善，此是善故，能招無想有情天中五蘊異熟。	今無想定一向是善，此是善故，能招無想有情天中五蘊異熟。	005	Now, the attainment of non-perception is entirely wholesome. Because it is wholesome, it can attract the five aggregates as its retribution in the heavens of the sentient beings of non-perception.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c12_16']	既是善性，為順何受？	既是善性，為順何受？	005	Since it is wholesome, to what kind of feeling does it correspond?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c13_11']	唯順生受，非順現後及不定受。	唯順生受，非順現後及不定受。	005	It only corresponds to the feeling of pleasure in the present life, not to the feeling of pleasure in the future life, nor to the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c15_14']	若起此定後雖退失，傳說現身必還能起，當生無想有情天中，故得此定必不能入正性離生。	若起此定後雖退失，傳說現身必還能起，當生無想有情天中，故得此定必不能入正性離生。	005	It is said that even if one regresses and loses it after producing this attainment, one will definitely be able to produce it again in the present body, and will be born in the heavens of the sentient beings of non-perception. Therefore, one who attains this attainment is definitely unable to enter the correct certainty of the path of seeing.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c17_9']	又許此定唯異生得非諸聖者，以諸聖者於無想定如見深坑不樂入故。	又許此定唯異生得非諸聖者，以諸聖者於無想定如見深坑不樂入故。	005	Moreover, it is admitted that this attainment is only attained by ordinary beings, not by noble ones. Because noble ones, regarding the attainment of non-perception, are like seeing a deep pit and do not delight in entering it.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c18_11']	要執無想為真解脫，起出離想而修此定；	要執無想為真解脫，起出離想而修此定；	005	One must grasp the non-conceptual as true liberation and give rise to the thought of leaving in order to cultivate this samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c20_2']	一切聖者不執有漏為真解脫及真出離故，於此定必不修行。	一切聖者不執有漏為真解脫及真出離故，於此定必不修行。	005	All noble ones do not grasp contaminated states as true liberation or true leaving, and therefore they definitely do not cultivate this samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c21_10']	若諸聖者修得第四靜慮定時，為如靜慮亦得去來無想定不？	若諸聖者修得第四靜慮定時，為如靜慮亦得去來無想定不？	005	When noble ones cultivate and attain the fourth meditative absorption, do they also attain past and future non-conceptual states as they do with meditative absorption?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c21_15']	餘亦不得。	餘亦不得。	005	Others also do not attain it.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c22_2']	所以者何？	所以者何？	005	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c24_6']	彼雖曾習，以無心故，要大加行方便修得，故初得時唯得一世，謂得現在，如初受得別解脫戒。	彼雖曾習，以無心故，要大加行方便修得，故初得時唯得一世，謂得現在，如初受得別解脫戒。	005	Although they have previously cultivated it, because it is mindless, one must cultivate it with great effort and skillful means. Therefore, when first attained, one only attains one moment, namely the present, just as when first receiving the prātimokṣa precepts.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0024c25_16']	得此定已，第二念等乃至未捨亦成過去，以無心故，無未來修。	得此定已，第二念等乃至未捨亦成過去，以無心故，無未來修。	005	After attaining this samādhi, in the second moment and so forth, until one has not yet abandoned it, one also accomplishes the past. Because it is mindless, there is no cultivation of the future.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c08_11']	非離所餘因緣和合，唯生相力能生所生，故諸未來非皆頓起。	非離所餘因緣和合，唯生相力能生所生，故諸未來非皆頓起。	005	Apart from the combination of the remaining causes and conditions, the power of the characteristic of birth alone cannot give rise to what is born, therefore all future [dharmas] do not arise simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c09_10']	若爾，我等唯見因緣有生功能，無別生相。	若爾，我等唯見因緣有生功能，無別生相。	005	If that is so, we only see that causes and conditions have the ability to give rise [to dharmas], there is no separate characteristic of birth.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c10_11']	有因緣合諸法即生，無即不生，何勞生相？	有因緣合諸法即生，無即不生，何勞生相？	005	When there is a combination of causes and conditions, dharmas arise; when there is not, they do not arise. What need is there for the characteristic of birth?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c11_1']	故知唯有因緣力起。	故知唯有因緣力起。	005	Therefore we know that there is only the power of causes and conditions giving rise [to dharmas].
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c11_10']	豈諸有法皆汝所知？	豈諸有法皆汝所知？	005	How can all dharmas be known by you?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c12_8']	法性幽微甚難知故，雖現有體而不可知。	法性幽微甚難知故，雖現有體而不可知。	005	The nature of dharmas is profound and very difficult to know, therefore even though they presently have substance, they cannot be known.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c13_18']	生相若無應無生覺，又第六轉言不應成，謂色之生、受之生等。	生相若無應無生覺，又第六轉言不應成，謂色之生、受之生等。	005	If the characteristic of birth did not exist, there would be no awareness of birth, and moreover the sixth type of expression would not be established, namely the birth of form, the birth of feeling, etc.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c14_7']	如不應說色之色言。	如不應說色之色言。	005	It would be like saying the form of form which is not appropriate.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c16_8']	若爾，為成空無我覺，法外應執空無我性。	若爾，為成空無我覺，法外應執空無我性。	005	If this is so, then in order to realize emptiness and nonself, one must grasp emptiness and nonself apart from dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c18_12']	為成一二大小各別合離彼此有性等覺，應如外道法外執有數量各別合離彼此有等別性。	為成一二大小各別合離彼此有性等覺，應如外道法外執有數量各別合離彼此有等別性。	005	In order to realize the distinctions of one and two, large and small, separate and combined, here and there, existence and nonexistence, etc., one must grasp number, size, separateness, combination, here and there, existence, etc., apart from dharmas, just as non-Buddhists do.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c19_12']	又為成立第六轉言，應執別有色之聚性。	又為成立第六轉言，應執別有色之聚性。	005	Moreover, in order to establish the sixth type of expression, one must grasp the nature of the aggregation of form apart from form.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c20_12']	又如說言色之自性，此第六轉言何得成？	又如說言色之自性，此第六轉言何得成？	005	Moreover, how can the sixth type of expression, such as the intrinsic nature of form, be established?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c22_2']	是故生等唯假建立，無別實物，為了諸行本無今有假立為生。	是故生等唯假建立，無別實物，為了諸行本無今有假立為生。	005	Therefore, birth, etc., are only nominally established, and there are no separate real entities. In order to understand that dharmas that did not exist previously now exist, one provisionally establishes them as birth.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c24_15']	如是本無今有生相，依色等法種類眾多，為簡所餘說第六轉言色之生受之生等，為令他知此生唯色非餘受等。	如是本無今有生相，依色等法種類眾多，為簡所餘說第六轉言色之生受之生等，為令他知此生唯色非餘受等。	005	In this way, the characteristic of birth, which did not exist previously but now exists, is based on form, etc. Because there are many types of dharmas, in order to distinguish them from the rest, the sixth type of expression is used, such as the birth of form, the birth of feeling, etc. This is in order to let others know that this birth is only form and not feeling, etc.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c25_2']	餘例亦然。	餘例亦然。	005	The other cases are similar.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c26_10']	如是住等隨應當知。	如是住等隨應當知。	005	In this way, abiding and so forth should be understood as appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c27_13']	若行離生相而得生者，虛空無為等何故不生？	若行離生相而得生者，虛空無為等何故不生？	005	If arising is obtained by separating from the characteristic of arising, why do unconditioned dharmas such as space not arise?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0028c28_16']	諸行名生由本無今有，無為體常有，何得言生？	諸行名生由本無今有，無為體常有，何得言生？	005	The reason why conditioned dharmas are called arising is because they exist now after not existing before. The substance of unconditioned dharmas is always present. How can it be said to arise?
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0029a01_4']	又如法爾不說一切皆有生，如是應許非一切法皆可生。	又如法爾不說一切皆有生，如是應許非一切法皆可生。	005	Moreover, just as it is not said that all dharmas have arising, in the same way, it should be admitted that not all dharmas can arise.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0029a02_12']	又如有為同有生相，而許因緣望有為法或有功能或無功能。	又如有為同有生相，而許因緣望有為法或有功能或無功能。	005	Moreover, just as conditioned dharmas have the characteristic of arising in common, yet it is admitted that causes and conditions either have or do not have efficacy with regard to conditioned dharmas,
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0029a04_13']	如是應許一切有為及無為法同無生相，而諸因緣望彼二法一有生用、一無生用。	如是應許一切有為及無為法同無生相，而諸因緣望彼二法一有生用、一無生用。	005	in the same way, it should be admitted that all conditioned and unconditioned dharmas are the same in lacking the characteristic of arising, yet causes and conditions have the function of arising with regard to the former but not with regard to the latter.
['ZH_T29_1558_005:0029a05_13']	毘婆沙師說生等相別有實物，其理應成。	毘婆沙師說生等相別有實物，其理應成。	005	The Vaibhāṣikas say that the characteristics of arising and so forth are real entities. Their reasoning should be established.

['ZH_T29_1558_005:0029a07_13']	非恐有鹿而不種麥，懼多蠅附不食美團。	非恐有鹿而不種麥，懼多蠅附不食美團。	005	It is not that one does not plant wheat for fear of having deer, or does not eat delicious cakes for fear of attracting many flies.
