['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a22_7']	彌勒！	彌勒！	Maitreya!
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a22_10']	不異。	不異。	They are not different.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a22_14']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a22_19']	彼念唯識。	彼念唯識。	Those thoughts are only consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a23_2']	所明識我說。	所明識我說。	I explain the consciousness that is illuminated.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a23_5']	世尊！	世尊！	World-Honored One!
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a24_11']	若是彼三昧境界形像心中不異者，云何以彼心而取彼心？	若是彼三昧境界形像心中不異者，云何以彼心而取彼心？	If the form and image within the samādhi realm are not different from the mind, how can that mind apprehend that mind?
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a24_14']	佛言：	佛言：	The Buddha said:
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a24_17']	彌勒！	彌勒！	Maitreya!

['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a26_16']	譬如緣像故唯見像，而言我見像。	譬如緣像故唯見像，而言我見像。	It is like seeing only an image due to the conditions of an image, and saying I see an image.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a27_13']	以是義，中間不離彼像，中間像相似見。	以是義，中間不離彼像，中間像相似見。	By this principle, the image is not separate from the middle, and the image seen in the middle is similar.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101a28_7']	如是生彼心，如是中間而言見。	如是生彼心，如是中間而言見。	In this way, that mind arises, and in the middle it is said to see.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b01_4']	如是此阿含將證成，如是入定心時，隨所青等，知所有見像，還見彼心離塵青等。	如是此阿含將證成，如是入定心時，隨所青等，知所有見像，還見彼心離塵青等。	In this way, this scripture is established, and in this way, when the mind enters concentration, whatever blue, etc. is known and seen, one sees that mind apart from the dust, blue, etc.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b04_3']	如是順釋已，菩薩於一切識中如是測量取唯識，中無彼青等憶念持識前已，彼念所見聞思修，亦隨所憶事識，彼亦念過去故。	如是順釋已，菩薩於一切識中如是測量取唯識，中無彼青等憶念持識前已，彼念所見聞思修，亦隨所憶事識，彼亦念過去故。	Having thus explained in accordance with the sutra, the bodhisattva thus measures and grasps only consciousness in all consciousnesses. The consciousness that remembers and holds the blue, etc. that existed before has already ceased. The consciousness that sees, hears, thinks, and cultivates also follows the remembered object-consciousness. That also remembers the past, therefore.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b04_16']	彼現相唯識，得以此喻證故。	彼現相唯識，得以此喻證故。	The present appearance is only consciousness. This analogy can be used as evidence.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b05_13']	菩薩雖真智未覺已，應思量唯覺事。	菩薩雖真智未覺已，應思量唯覺事。	Although the bodhisattva has not yet realized true wisdom, he should contemplate and understand only the realized object.

['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b10_2']	行顛倒等煩惱染處因故。	行顛倒等煩惱染處因故。	Because it is the cause of the defilement of afflictions such as the practice of inversion, etc.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b10_13']	餘時非塵，為塵妄不成。	餘時非塵，為塵妄不成。	At other times, the non-object becomes falsely established as an object.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b11_7']	既無彼事，煩惱障智障染事不成。	既無彼事，煩惱障智障染事不成。	Since those things do not exist, the defiled things of the afflictive obstructions and the obstructions to omniscience are not established.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b12_5']	彼既無淨事不成，是故如是彼順義成。	彼既無淨事不成，是故如是彼順義成。	Since those are not established, the pure things are not established. Therefore, in this way, the meaning of their conformity is established.

['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b22_19']	如是彼一切諸識無塵故，唯如是同見相。	如是彼一切諸識無塵故，唯如是同見相。	Thus, all those consciousnesses are without objects, and there is only such a same appearance of cognition.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b24_2']	眼識等色等念故，及彼識見乃至身識見唯意識。	眼識等色等念故，及彼識見乃至身識見唯意識。	Because of the recollection of form, etc., by eye consciousness, etc., and because the seeing up to the seeing by body consciousness is only mental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101b25_14']	一切眼等法盡識，同念意識識同見分別故，於意識及一切識生現相故。	一切眼等法盡識，同念意識識同見分別故，於意識及一切識生現相故。	All the dharmas of the eye, etc., are consciousness, and the mental consciousness cognizes the same appearance of cognition, because it produces the appearance of cognition in the mental consciousness and all consciousnesses.

['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101c04_2']	是中有偈：	是中有偈：	There is a verse on this:
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101c05_0']	遠至獨行故，　　無身窟所依，	遠至獨行故，　　無身窟所依，	Because it goes far, moves alone, has no body, and relies on a cave,

This should be understood. In this way, only the memory and conceptual consciousnesses are the causes for the arising of that view.

['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101c16_12']	相違識相智故，亦如餓鬼畜生人及諸天等，同事中見既別。	相違識相智故，亦如餓鬼畜生人及諸天等，同事中見既別。	Because they know the characteristics of contradictory consciousnesses, just as hungry ghosts, animals, humans, and various gods have different perceptions in the same situation.
['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101c17_11']	不念見覺識故，亦如過去未來夢現相念故。	不念見覺識故，亦如過去未來夢現相念故。	Because they do not think of seeing, cognition, or consciousness, just as in the past, future, and present dreams.

['ZH_T31_1592_001:0101c21_1']	及隨順三種智知故，如是諸菩薩及得禪定者，得心自在憶持力故，現如是事；	及隨順三種智知故，如是諸菩薩及得禪定者，得心自在憶持力故，現如是事；	And because they know in accordance with the three kinds of knowledge, thus bodhisattvas and those who attain meditative concentration attain mastery of the mind and the power of recollection, and therefore manifest such things;
