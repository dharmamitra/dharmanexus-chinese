['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558a26_9']	所以有此品來者，自《華嚴》始集、終竟靈山前會，謂開五乘之教也。	所以有此品來者，自《華嚴》始集、終竟靈山前會，謂開五乘之教也。	008	The reason this chapter exists is that from the beginning of the Flower Ornament Sutra to the end of Vulture Peak, it is called the teaching of the five vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558a27_7']	此經之始至信解之終，合五乘歸一乘也。	此經之始至信解之終，合五乘歸一乘也。	008	From the beginning of this sutra to the end of the chapter on understanding, it combines the five vehicles into one vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558a28_3']	今此一品，舉喻具釋開合之義也。	今此一品，舉喻具釋開合之義也。	008	Now this chapter uses a parable to fully explain the meaning of opening and combining.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558a29_7']	一地所生、一雨所潤，喻至理無二，故合五乘以歸一也。	一地所生、一雨所潤，喻至理無二，故合五乘以歸一也。	008	Born from the same earth, moistened by the same rain, the ultimate truth is non-dual, so the five vehicles are combined into one.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b01_14']	而諸草木各有差別，謂隨五乘根性說五種教門，謂開義也。	而諸草木各有差別，謂隨五乘根性說五種教門，謂開義也。	008	Yet the various grasses and trees have their own distinctions, referring to the teachings of the five vehicles according to the capacities of the five vehicles, which is called the meaning of opening.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b04_6']	若但開而不合則得教而失理，若但合而不開則得理而忘教，故今明雖開而合、雖合而開，雖合而開，一而常五；	若但開而不合則得教而失理，若但合而不開則得理而忘教，故今明雖開而合、雖合而開，雖合而開，一而常五；	008	If only opening without combining, then the teaching is obtained but the principle is lost; if only combining without opening, then the principle is obtained but the teaching is forgotten. Therefore, now it is explained that although opening while combining, although combining while opening, although combining while opening, one is always five;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b04_16']	雖開而合，五而常一。	雖開而合，五而常一。	008	Although it is opened, it is united, and although five, it is always one.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b05_17']	具識開合，理教始成，是以此品釋成一化開合義也。	具識開合，理教始成，是以此品釋成一化開合義也。	008	Fully understanding the opening and uniting, the principle and teaching are just established. Therefore, this chapter explains the meaning of the opening and uniting of the one teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b06_9']	然雖開而合，合名開合；	然雖開而合，合名開合；	008	Although it is opened, it is united, and the uniting is called the opening and uniting;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b06_19']	雖合而開，開名合開。	雖合而開，開名合開。	008	although it is united, it is opened, and the opening is called the uniting and opening.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b08_6']	合開即非開，開合即非合，故非開非合、非五非一，強為開合。	合開即非開，開合即非合，故非開非合、非五非一，強為開合。	008	The uniting and opening are not the opening, and the opening and uniting are not the uniting. Therefore, it is neither opened nor united, neither five nor one. It is forcefully called the opening and uniting.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b10_8']	故下文云「究竟涅槃常寂滅相終歸於空」，蓋是諸法實體故稱為妙，不為諸邊所染目為蓮華也。	故下文云「究竟涅槃常寂滅相終歸於空」，蓋是諸法實體故稱為妙，不為諸邊所染目為蓮華也。	008	Therefore, the text below says, The ultimate nirvāṇa, the characteristic of eternal quiescence and extinction, ultimately returns to emptiness. This is the true essence of all dharmas, therefore it is called wonderful. It is not tainted by any extremes, and is called the lotus flower.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b14_6']	次依《法華論》明此品來意者，火宅譬破凡夫病，窮子譬破二乘病，雲雨譬破菩薩病，菩薩之人聞上來所說唯有一乘，便謂畢竟無復三乘方便，此即得實失權、存體忘用。	次依《法華論》明此品來意者，火宅譬破凡夫病，窮子譬破二乘病，雲雨譬破菩薩病，菩薩之人聞上來所說唯有一乘，便謂畢竟無復三乘方便，此即得實失權、存體忘用。	008	Next, based on the Fahua Lun, explaining the meaning of this chapter: The Fire-house Parable breaks the illness of ordinary beings, the Poor Son Parable breaks the illness of the Two Vehicles, and the Clouds and Rain Parable breaks the illness of Bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas, upon hearing the above teachings of only one vehicle, may think that there are ultimately no more expedient means of the Three Vehicles. This is losing the expedient and keeping the real, forgetting the function while grasping the essence.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b16_1']	然識權方乃悟實，達用乃鑒於體，既不識權亦不悟實，即權實俱喪、體用並亡。	然識權方乃悟實，達用乃鑒於體，既不識權亦不悟實，即權實俱喪、體用並亡。	008	However, only by understanding the expedient can one realize the real, and only by penetrating the function can one discern the essence. Since one does not understand the expedient, one also does not realize the real, and both the expedient and the real are lost, with essence and function both disappearing.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b17_7']	為治此病，故明雖一地所生、一雨所潤，而諸草木各有差別；	為治此病，故明雖一地所生、一雨所潤，而諸草木各有差別；	008	In order to treat this illness, it is explained that although they are born from the same ground and moistened by the same rain, the various grasses and trees have their own distinctions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b18_10']	雖至理無二而於緣有五，故權實義成、體用方顯。	雖至理無二而於緣有五，故權實義成、體用方顯。	008	Although the ultimate truth is non-dual, there are five in terms of conditions, thus the meaning of expedient and real is established, and essence and function are revealed.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b20_12']	此經既稱「教菩薩法佛所護念」，故令大士離凡夫二乘病及菩薩病，始是教菩薩法佛所護念。	此經既稱「教菩薩法佛所護念」，故令大士離凡夫二乘病及菩薩病，始是教菩薩法佛所護念。	008	Since this sutra is called the teaching for bodhisattvas that is guarded and contemplated by the Buddha, it causes great beings to depart from the illnesses of ordinary beings, shravakas, and bodhisattvas. Only then is it the teaching for bodhisattvas that is guarded and contemplated by the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b23_1']	次依述成意生起此品者，〈譬喻〉一品正明說教，〈信解品〉明中根領解，今此一品如來述成，述成者據譬而言。	次依述成意生起此品者，〈譬喻〉一品正明說教，〈信解品〉明中根領解，今此一品如來述成，述成者據譬而言。	008	Next, as for relying on the meaning of the praise to give rise to this chapter, the chapter on parables正明說教, the chapter on faith and understanding 明中根領解, and now this chapter 如來述成. As for the praise, it is based on the parables.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b23_10']	一切草木凡有二義：	一切草木凡有二義：	008	All grasses and trees generally have two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b23_16']	一、不知同；	一、不知同；	008	First, they do not know the same;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b23_22']	二、不知異。	二、不知異。	008	Second, they do not know the different.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b24_17']	不知同者，不知一地所生、一雨所潤也。	不知同者，不知一地所生、一雨所潤也。	008	Not knowing the same means not knowing that they are born from the same earth and moistened by the same rain.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b25_12']	不知異者，不知草木自有差別也。	不知異者，不知草木自有差別也。	008	Not knowing the different means not knowing that grasses and trees themselves have distinctions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b26_11']	假設如有一瑞草能知同異，即是奇特。	假設如有一瑞草能知同異，即是奇特。	008	Suppose there is a rare grass that can know the same and different, then it is extraordinary.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b27_1']	稟教之人亦有二迷：	稟教之人亦有二迷：	008	Those who receive the teaching also have two delusions:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b27_8']	一、不知理同；	一、不知理同；	008	First, not knowing the same principle;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b27_17']	二、不知於緣有異。	二、不知於緣有異。	008	Second, not knowing that there are differences in conditions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558b28_15']	而迦葉一人能知理同、能知教異，乃名奇特。	而迦葉一人能知理同、能知教異，乃名奇特。	008	But only Kāśyapa was able to know the principle was the same but the teachings were different, and this was considered extraordinary.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c02_10']	故下文云「如彼草木而不自知上中下性，汝等迦葉甚為希有，能知如來隨宜說法能信能受」，故舉雲雨藥草述成迦葉領解。	故下文云「如彼草木而不自知上中下性，汝等迦葉甚為希有，能知如來隨宜說法能信能受」，故舉雲雨藥草述成迦葉領解。	008	Therefore, the text below says, Like those grasses and trees that do not know their superior, middling, and inferior natures, you Kāśyapas are extremely rare, able to understand the Tathāgata's teachings according to circumstances, able to believe and accept them. Therefore, the cloud, rain, and medicinal herbs are mentioned to praise Kāśyapa's understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c05_10']	若望迦葉，於〈信解品〉十譬十恩嘆佛功德猶自未盡，故更說雲雨草木之譬，廣嘆如來無方大用普益眾生，嘆不能盡，故說此品也。	若望迦葉，於〈信解品〉十譬十恩嘆佛功德猶自未盡，故更說雲雨草木之譬，廣嘆如來無方大用普益眾生，嘆不能盡，故說此品也。	008	If compared to Kāśyapa, even the ten parables and ten kinds of gratitude in the Chapter on Belief and Understanding praising the Buddha's merits are still not complete, so the parables of clouds, rain, and medicinal herbs are further mentioned, extensively praising the Tathāgata's extraordinary great functions universally benefiting sentient beings, praising them as inexhaustible, thus this chapter is explained.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c09_9']	若為釋成〈信解品〉者，上明十譬十恩，無漏無為諸法之王，能為下劣忍于斯事，即時眾謂佛過去之始、今會之終屈曲崎岴難心苦心，是故今明如來雖復府仰順從而無心屈曲。	若為釋成〈信解品〉者，上明十譬十恩，無漏無為諸法之王，能為下劣忍于斯事，即時眾謂佛過去之始、今會之終屈曲崎岴難心苦心，是故今明如來雖復府仰順從而無心屈曲。	008	If it is to explain the Chapter on Belief and Understanding, above it clarifies the ten similes and ten kinds of kindness, the Dharma King of no outflows and no conditioning, who can endure these matters for the inferior. At that time the assembly thought that the Buddha in the past began and now at this assembly ended, with a difficult mind and a painful mind. Therefore, now it clarifies that although the Tathāgata appears to be compliant, he has no mind of difficulty.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c11_4', 'ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c13_3']	故《華嚴》云「無心於彼此而能應一切」，故舉雲雨無心之譬釋成〈信解品〉也。🔽言「藥草喻品」者，藥是草木中治病之通稱，草即形木之別名，而言藥草者，通、別兩舉者也。	故《華嚴》云「無心於彼此而能應一切」，故舉雲雨無心之譬釋成〈信解品〉也。 言「藥草喻品」者，藥是草木中治病之通稱，草即形木之別名，而言藥草者，通、別兩舉者也。	008	Therefore the Huayan says, Without mind toward this and that, yet able to respond to all, thus it uses the simile of clouds and rain without mind to explain and complete the Chapter on Belief and Understanding.🔽As for the Chapter on the Parable of the Medicinal Herbs, medicine is a general term for curing illnesses among grasses and trees, and grass is a specific name for plants that are not trees. Speaking of medicinal herbs is to bring up both the general and specific.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c14_11']	但言藥草不舉藥木者，明木二即少、草三即多，故廢少從多也。	但言藥草不舉藥木者，明木二即少、草三即多，故廢少從多也。	008	But only speaking of medicinal herbs without bringing up medicinal trees, it clarifies that trees are two and thus few, while grasses are three and thus many, thus abandoning the few and following the many.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c15_11']	又今正述中根人領解，故題藥草不題藥木。	又今正述中根人領解，故題藥草不題藥木。	008	Moreover, now it is correctly describing the understanding of those of middling faculties, so the title uses the metaphor of medicinal herbs and not medicinal trees.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c16_8']	所以舉藥草喻中根人者，凡有三義：	所以舉藥草喻中根人者，凡有三義：	008	The reason for using the metaphor of medicinal herbs to illustrate those of middling faculties is because there are three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c17_11']	一者、稟教得解，解生必能滅惑，喻如藥草治病義也。	一者、稟教得解，解生必能滅惑，喻如藥草治病義也。	008	First, receiving the teaching and attaining understanding, understanding necessarily arises and can extinguish delusions, which is like the meaning of medicinal herbs curing illnesses.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c18_17']	二者、藥草能愈他疾，喻聞教得解即成菩薩必有兼濟之功。	二者、藥草能愈他疾，喻聞教得解即成菩薩必有兼濟之功。	008	Second, medicinal herbs can cure the illnesses of others, which illustrates that hearing the teaching and attaining understanding immediately becomes a bodhisattva, necessarily having the merit of benefiting others.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c20_14']	三者、藥草是草中之貴，顯成菩薩人中之尊貴，異上聲聞未得領悟如鄙賤窮子也。	三者、藥草是草中之貴，顯成菩薩人中之尊貴，異上聲聞未得領悟如鄙賤窮子也。	008	Third, medicinal herbs are the most precious among grasses, revealing that becoming a bodhisattva is the most honored among people, different from the śrāvakas who have not yet attained understanding like the contemptible poor son.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c20_16']	問：	問：	008	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c21_19']	藥草無情而受潤，稟教有心而領解，何以為喻耶？	藥草無情而受潤，稟教有心而領解，何以為喻耶？	008	Medicinal herbs are insentient and receive nourishment, while those who receive the teaching have minds and attain understanding. How can this be used as a metaphor?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c22_1']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c22_10']	欲明緣教相稱義也。	欲明緣教相稱義也。	008	It is to clarify the meaning of the teaching and conditions being in accord.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c24_6']	雲雨無私而潤，草木無心而受，若無私而潤、有心而受，即緣教相乖，何由領解？	雲雨無私而潤，草木無心而受，若無私而潤、有心而受，即緣教相乖，何由領解？	008	The clouds and rain have no partiality in moistening, and the grasses and trees have no mind in receiving. If there is no partiality in moistening but a mind in receiving, then the conditioned teaching will be contradictory. How can one understand?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c27_4']	故舉無心之根顯無私之教，可謂其說法者無說無示，其聽法者無聞無得，亦說如幻說、聞如幻聞，無言顯道、絕聽雨華，即其事也。	故舉無心之根顯無私之教，可謂其說法者無說無示，其聽法者無聞無得，亦說如幻說、聞如幻聞，無言顯道、絕聽雨華，即其事也。	008	Therefore, citing the root without mind reveals the teaching without partiality. It can be said that the Dharma speaker has no speaking and no demonstration, and the Dharma listener has no hearing and no attainment. It is also said that the teaching is like an illusory teaching, and the hearing is like an illusory hearing. The ineffable reveals the Way, and the listening is like the rain of flowers. This is precisely the matter.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c27_13']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c29_13']	文云「是法不可示言辭相寂滅」，我今既示不可示，雖示而無言，亦是聞不可聞，雖聞而絕聽也。	文云「是法不可示言辭相寂滅」，我今既示不可示，雖示而無言，亦是聞不可聞，雖聞而絕聽也。	008	The text says, This Dharma cannot be demonstrated, and the characteristics of words are extinguished. Although I now demonstrate what cannot be demonstrated, even though I demonstrate it, there is no speaking. It is also hearing what cannot be heard, and even though I hear it, I have ceased listening.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0558c29_15']	問：	問：	008	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a01_17']	譬喻，藥草、化城皆是舉喻，何故火宅獨受譬喻名耶？	譬喻，藥草、化城皆是舉喻，何故火宅獨受譬喻名耶？	008	In the parables, the medicinal herbs and the illusory city are all cited as analogies. Why is the burning house alone given the name of parable?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a01_19']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a03_11']	通皆互得，而別不例者，火宅在初故受其通稱，餘皆居後當其別名也。	通皆互得，而別不例者，火宅在初故受其通稱，餘皆居後當其別名也。	008	They all mutually obtain, but the specific does not correspond to the general. The burning house is at the beginning, so it receives the general title. The rest are all at the end, with their specific names.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a03_13']	問：	問：	008	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a04_12']	文具舉雲雨草木四事，何故偏題藥草名耶？	文具舉雲雨草木四事，何故偏題藥草名耶？	008	The text fully presents the four things of clouds, rain, grass, and trees. Why is it titled only the Medicine Herbs?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a04_14']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a06_11']	就文而言，藥草在前喻機感扣聖，雲雨居後譬形聲應物，要由感方應，故從初立名。	就文而言，藥草在前喻機感扣聖，雲雨居後譬形聲應物，要由感方應，故從初立名。	008	In terms of the text, the medicine herbs are at the beginning, metaphorically illustrating the capacity for response knocking on the sages. The clouds and rain are at the end, metaphorically illustrating the response to things through form and sound. It is necessary to respond based on the capacity for response, so the name is established based on the beginning.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a07_15']	又今述中根領解，故以藥草題品，雲雨不爾故不標名。	又今述中根領解，故以藥草題品，雲雨不爾故不標名。	008	Moreover, now it is the middle capacity for response understanding and accepting, so it is titled the Medicine Herbs Chapter. The clouds and rain are not like this, so the name is not indicated.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a07_17']	問：	問：	008	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a09_5']	舉藥草以述成故云藥草品者，上明窮子以領解，應云窮子品？	舉藥草以述成故云藥草品者，上明窮子以領解，應云窮子品？	008	Since the Medicine Herbs are presented to describe the understanding and acceptance, it should be titled the Medicine Herbs Chapter. The above clarifies the poor son's understanding and acceptance, so it should be titled the Poor Son Chapter?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a09_7']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a10_4']	窮子通迷悟，今言信解故用別以立名；	窮子通迷悟，今言信解故用別以立名；	008	The poor son is common to delusion and enlightenment. Now it is said to be understanding and acceptance, so the specific is used to establish the name.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a11_2']	卉木通於毒藥，今云藥草亦從別為稱。	卉木通於毒藥，今云藥草亦從別為稱。	008	Grasses and trees are common to poisonous medicine. Now it is said to be medicine herbs, which is also a specific appellation.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a11_18']	上明窮子信解，從信解以立名；	上明窮子信解，從信解以立名；	008	Above, it clarifies the poor son's faith and understanding, and names it based on faith and understanding;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a12_13']	今云如來述成，應從述成以為稱耶？	今云如來述成，應從述成以為稱耶？	008	Now, it says the chapter on medicinal herbs, should it be called based on the Tathāgata's approval?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a12_15']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a13_7']	今云藥草品者，可含二義：	今云藥草品者，可含二義：	008	Now, it says the chapter on medicinal herbs, it can contain two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a13_18']	一者、得述成中根領解；	一者、得述成中根領解；	008	First, it obtains the approval in the understanding of the middle-ranked;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a14_8']	二者、廣明佛教利益無邊。	二者、廣明佛教利益無邊。	008	Second, it extensively clarifies the Buddha's teachings' boundless benefits.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a15_7']	述成但得成前，闕於後義故不云述成品。	述成但得成前，闕於後義故不云述成品。	008	The approval only obtains the completion of the previous, lacking the latter meaning, thus it is not called the completion of the approval.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a17_4']	又領解題信解，就法為名，述成稱藥草，據譬為稱，欲法譬兩存，不應一類立名也。	又領解題信解，就法為名，述成稱藥草，據譬為稱，欲法譬兩存，不應一類立名也。	008	Moreover, the title of understanding takes the Dharma as the name, and the approval is called medicinal herbs, taking the analogy as the name. Desiring to preserve both the Dharma and analogy, the name should not be established in one category.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0559a17_9']	就品為二：	就品為二：	008	In the chapter, there are two parts:

Although there is being moistened and growing, they are both moistened by one rain and born from one earth. Although that which can give birth and that which can moisten is one, the various grasses and trees each have distinctions. Therefore, these eight metaphors come in sequence.

The Buddha's teachings in the past can give rise to the five vehicles' wholesome roots like grass and trees, which are like the earth. Since there are seeds of the five vehicles that inspire the Buddha to appear in the world, it is like the rising of clouds. When the Tathāgata appears in the world, he will surely expound the true Dharma, which is next explained as the pouring of rain. Sentient beings initially accept the Buddha's teachings with joy, so it is called being moistened, and each receives benefits, which is likened to growth. The ultimate truth is non-dual, like the one earth and one rain, but the differences in the benefits obtained by the five vehicles are like the distinctions in the grass and trees.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564a23_15']	三草者，下中上三品草也。	三草者，下中上三品草也。	008	The three grasses are the three grades of lower, middle, and upper grasses.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564a24_4']	二木者，大小兩樹也。	二木者，大小兩樹也。	008	The two trees are the two sizes of trees.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564a25_14']	此是無階級階級，故開諸位不同，不如有所得人一向定作淺深之解。	此是無階級階級，故開諸位不同，不如有所得人一向定作淺深之解。	008	This is the hierarchy of no hierarchy, so the various stages are opened differently, unlike the shallow and deep understanding that is unilaterally fixed by those who attain something.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564a29_12']	所以然者，經中階級之說無定，或說初發心時便成正覺，或說久劫行行方證菩提，或勸起道意令住不退轉，或說實無發心亦無退者，皆是善巧化物，不可定相執之也。	所以然者，經中階級之說無定，或說初發心時便成正覺，或說久劫行行方證菩提，或勸起道意令住不退轉，或說實無發心亦無退者，皆是善巧化物，不可定相執之也。	008	The reason for this is that the teachings in the sūtras are not fixed. Sometimes it is said that one becomes a buddha upon first generating the mind of enlightenment, sometimes it is said that one realizes enlightenment only after cultivating for many eons, sometimes one is encouraged to give rise to the intention for the path and abide in irreversibility, and sometimes it is said that there is truly no generating the mind and no one who regresses. All of these are skillful means for transforming beings, and one should not grasp at them with fixed concepts.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b01_6']	今示一方淺深，故說三草二木。	今示一方淺深，故說三草二木。	008	Now, in order to show the shallow and deep of one direction, it speaks of the three grasses and two trees.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b03_8']	人天是世間乘名為小草，聲聞緣覺是出世間乘名為中草，地前四十心既是大乘名為上草。	人天是世間乘名為小草，聲聞緣覺是出世間乘名為中草，地前四十心既是大乘名為上草。	008	The human and heavenly realms are worldly vehicles called the small grass, the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha are supramundane vehicles called the medium grass, and the forty minds prior to the grounds are the great vehicle called the large grass.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b05_6']	若據無生忍而判義者，初地始得淺無生忍名為小樹，七地深入無生忍名為大樹。	若據無生忍而判義者，初地始得淺無生忍名為小樹，七地深入無生忍名為大樹。	008	If one determines the meaning based on the acceptance of non-arising, then the initial attainment of the shallow acceptance of non-arising in the first ground is called the small tree, and the deep penetration of the acceptance of non-arising in the seventh ground is called the large tree.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b05_19']	故《智度論》釋無生有二位：	故《智度論》釋無生有二位：	008	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra explains that non-arising has two stages:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b06_8']	一者初地，二者七地。	一者初地，二者七地。	008	The first is the first ground, and the second is the seventh ground.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b08_6']	所以開二位者，若就二忍明義，地前凡位名為順忍，初地已上既是聖位名為無生忍。	所以開二位者，若就二忍明義，地前凡位名為順忍，初地已上既是聖位名為無生忍。	008	The reason for opening up two stages is that if we clarify the meaning based on the two forbearances, the stage before the grounds is called the forbearance of compliance, and the stage of the holy ones beginning from the first ground is called the forbearance of non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b10_1']	若五忍明義，地前名伏忍，初三地為信忍，次三地為順忍，次三地為無生忍。	若五忍明義，地前名伏忍，初三地為信忍，次三地為順忍，次三地為無生忍。	008	If we clarify the meaning based on the five forbearances, the stage before the grounds is called the forbearance of subduing, the first three grounds are called the forbearance of faith, the next three grounds are called the forbearance of compliance, and the next three grounds are called the forbearance of non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b11_8']	若依《瓔珞經》，後三地名寂滅忍，謂第十地、等覺、妙覺三地也。	若依《瓔珞經》，後三地名寂滅忍，謂第十地、等覺、妙覺三地也。	008	If we rely on the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras, the last three grounds are called the forbearance of quiescence, referring to the tenth ground, the ground of equal enlightenment, and the ground of wondrous enlightenment, the three grounds.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b12_7']	若依《仁王經》，但後二地，謂法雲地、佛地也。	若依《仁王經》，但後二地，謂法雲地、佛地也。	008	If we rely on the Benevolent Kings Sūtra, there are only the last two grounds, namely the cloud of dharma ground and the buddha ground.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b13_3']	第七地既是無生之始故名無生忍。	第七地既是無生之始故名無生忍。	008	Since the seventh ground is the beginning of non-arising, it is called the forbearance of non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b15_8']	若以功用、無功用分二位者，初地至七地名功用位謂小樹也，八地至等覺地是無功用道名為大樹。	若以功用、無功用分二位者，初地至七地名功用位謂小樹也，八地至等覺地是無功用道名為大樹。	008	If we divide the two stages based on the distinction between with effort and without effort, the first ground up to the seventh ground is called the stage with effort, referring to the small tree, and the eighth ground up to the ground of equal enlightenment is called the path without effort, referred to as the great tree.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b17_11']	經論不同，具有二義，依此經判位，三草二木總分三位，人天為下品，二乘為中品，菩薩為上品；	經論不同，具有二義，依此經判位，三草二木總分三位，人天為下品，二乘為中品，菩薩為上品；	008	The sutras and treatises differ, but both have two meanings. According to this sutra, the stages are divided into three levels: humans and gods are the lower level, the two vehicles are the middle level, and bodhisattvas are the upper level;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b18_19']	就菩薩中自開三品，地前四十心為下品，登地已上亦開二品。	就菩薩中自開三品，地前四十心為下品，登地已上亦開二品。	008	within the bodhisattvas, three levels are further distinguished: the forty minds before the grounds are the lower level, and those who have ascended to the grounds are also divided into two levels.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b20_6']	若爾者，二乘之人既稱中草不及上草，即知是十信前人也。	若爾者，二乘之人既稱中草不及上草，即知是十信前人也。	008	If that is so, since the two vehicles are called the middle grass and not as good as the upper grass, we know they are before the ten faiths.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b21_2']	成論師不應言羅漢與六地齊功。	成論師不應言羅漢與六地齊功。	008	The masters of the Satyasiddhi Śāstra should not say that arhats are equal in merit to the sixth ground.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b22_16']	又〈譬喻品〉云「聲聞之人以信力故得入一乘」，即知未迴小入大在十信前也。	又〈譬喻品〉云「聲聞之人以信力故得入一乘」，即知未迴小入大在十信前也。	008	Moreover, the Parable Chapter says, The śrāvakas, by the power of faith, can enter the One Vehicle, so we know that before turning to the Great from the Small, they are before the ten faiths.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b24_17']	二科互有開合不同，五乘即開淺合深，三草二木即開深合淺。	二科互有開合不同，五乘即開淺合深，三草二木即開深合淺。	008	The two sections have different ways of opening and combining the shallow and deep. The five vehicles open the shallow and combine the deep, while the three grasses and two trees open the deep and combine the shallow.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b26_5']	開淺合深者，開小草為天人兩乘，開中草為聲聞緣覺二也。	開淺合深者，開小草為天人兩乘，開中草為聲聞緣覺二也。	008	As for revealing the shallow and combining the profound, revealing the small grass as the two vehicles of heavenly beings and humans, and revealing the medium grass as the two vehicles of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b27_2']	合深者，總合大乘因果悉入佛乘也。	合深者，總合大乘因果悉入佛乘也。	008	As for combining the profound, it is to combine the causes and effects of the Great Vehicle and include them all in the Buddha Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b27_4']	問：	問：	008	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b27_9']	何故爾耶？	何故爾耶？	008	Why is it so?

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564b29_15']	五乘之教並以果義標乘，故〈譬喻品〉云「三車在門外」，即以三果為三乘，菩薩為求佛果故還屬佛乘攝也。	五乘之教並以果義標乘，故〈譬喻品〉云「三車在門外」，即以三果為三乘，菩薩為求佛果故還屬佛乘攝也。	008	The teachings of the five vehicles are all named vehicles based on the meaning of fruition. Therefore, the Parable Chapter says, The three carts are outside the gate. It takes the three fruitions as the three vehicles. Bodhisattvas are seeking the fruition of Buddhahood, so they are still included in the Buddha Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c03_9']	人天樂果名之為乘，為求人天樂果故修人天兩行，故以果標乘，為欲引物令修因趣果，所以五乘明義，開淺合深也。	人天樂果名之為乘，為求人天樂果故修人天兩行，故以果標乘，為欲引物令修因趣果，所以五乘明義，開淺合深也。	008	The pleasant fruition of humans and gods is called a vehicle. In order to seek the pleasant fruition of humans and gods, one cultivates the two practices of humans and gods. Therefore, the fruition is used to name the vehicle. In order to attract beings to cultivate causes and seek fruition, the meaning of the five vehicles is revealed by revealing the shallow and combining the profound.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c05_4']	三草二木開深合淺者，合前四乘為小中二草，以人天為小草，以二乘為中草。	三草二木開深合淺者，合前四乘為小中二草，以人天為小草，以二乘為中草。	008	As for revealing the profound and combining the shallow of the three grasses and two trees, it combines the previous four vehicles into the two grasses of small and medium, taking humans and gods as the small grass and taking the two vehicles as the medium grass.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c06_3']	開深者，開大乘為三品，即上草及二木也。	開深者，開大乘為三品，即上草及二木也。	008	Opening the profound means opening the Mahayana into three grades, which are the upper grass and the two trees.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c08_11']	所以爾者，為扶此經讚揚大乘教菩薩法，明人天猶在三界火宅、二乘未度五百由旬，是故合淺而開深也。	所以爾者，為扶此經讚揚大乘教菩薩法，明人天猶在三界火宅、二乘未度五百由旬，是故合淺而開深也。	008	The reason for doing so is to support this sutra and praise the Mahayana teaching of bodhisattvas. It clarifies that humans and gods are still in the burning house of the three realms, and the two vehicles have not yet crossed the five hundred yojanas, so the shallow is combined and the profound is opened.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c09_17']	又五乘明義即有佛果之乘，三草二木但取因乘不明佛果。	又五乘明義即有佛果之乘，三草二木但取因乘不明佛果。	008	Moreover, the meaning of the five vehicles is that there is the vehicle of Buddhahood. The three grasses and two trees only take the causal vehicle and do not clarify the fruition of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c11_2']	所以然者，五乘為欲將五果以引物，故說佛果為乘；	所以然者，五乘為欲將五果以引物，故說佛果為乘；	008	The reason for this is that the five vehicles use the five fruits to attract beings, so the fruition of Buddhahood is spoken of as the vehicle;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c12_2']	今明三草二木受潤增長之義，故但說因也。	今明三草二木受潤增長之義，故但說因也。	008	Now, the meaning of the three grasses and two trees receiving moisture and growing is clarified, so only the causes are spoken of.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c13_11']	又昔教明開義，故開世間為人天二乘，開出世為三乘，故成五乘；	又昔教明開義，故開世間為人天二乘，開出世為三乘，故成五乘；	008	Moreover, the teachings of the past clarify the meaning of opening, so the mundane is opened into the two vehicles of humans and gods, and the supramundane is opened into the three vehicles, thus forming the five vehicles;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c15_1']	今欲顯合義，故合世間為一，合二乘為一，故合彼四乘歸於一乘。	今欲顯合義，故合世間為一，合二乘為一，故合彼四乘歸於一乘。	008	Now, in order to manifest the meaning of combining, the mundane is combined into one, and the two vehicles are combined into one, thus combining those four vehicles into the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c15_10']	但一乘中自開三位：	但一乘中自開三位：	008	However, within the One Vehicle itself, three levels are distinguished:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c16_2']	一者、地前四十心為上草；	一者、地前四十心為上草；	008	First, the forty minds before the grounds are considered the upper grass;

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c19_7']	彼經明由大地故有四種重擔，由攝受正法故有四乘：	彼經明由大地故有四種重擔，由攝受正法故有四乘：	008	That sūtra clarifies that due to the great earth, there are four kinds of heavy burdens. Due to embracing the true Dharma, there are four vehicles:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c20_8']	合天人為一，開二乘為二，合大乘因果為一也。	合天人為一，開二乘為二，合大乘因果為一也。	008	Combining devas and humans as one, dividing the two vehicles into two, and combining the cause and effect of the Great Vehicle into one.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0564c21_7']	與《智度論》五種善其義不同，不須會也。	與《智度論》五種善其義不同，不須會也。	008	It is different in meaning from the five kinds of goodness in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra, so there is no need to reconcile them.

At that time, the assembly thought that the Tathāgata's virtues were all in the words of the four great disciples, so at the beginning of the chapter, eight dharmas and eight similes are used to show that the Tathāgata also has immeasurable merits. At that time, the assembly thought that the praise of the Buddha's virtues was already complete, so now it is explained that although this simile is used, it is like a drop in the ocean compared to the Buddha's wisdom.

Since they are both ordinary people, the meaning of growth is not evident, so they are omitted and not combined.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565a23_11']	又一義，前之二凡入總合中攝之，是以文云「令諸世間普得具足」，世間即二凡也。	又一義，前之二凡入總合中攝之，是以文云「令諸世間普得具足」，世間即二凡也。	008	There is another interpretation: The first two ordinary people are included in the general combination. Therefore, the text says to enable all worlds to be fully endowed. The worlds refer to the two ordinary people.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565a24_4']	但凡義增長不顯，故入總合中；	但凡義增長不顯，故入總合中；	008	But the meaning of ordinary people is not evident in growth, so they are included in the general combination;

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b01_17']	即上「究竟涅槃常寂滅相終歸於空」，蓋是明大涅槃果位之法，故大樹因人聞之歡喜也。	即上「究竟涅槃常寂滅相終歸於空」，蓋是明大涅槃果位之法，故大樹因人聞之歡喜也。	008	It is the ultimate nirvana, the characteristic of eternal quiescence, ultimately returning to emptiness mentioned above. This clarifies the dharma of the fruition stage of great nirvana, so the causal person of the Great Tree Sutra hears it and rejoices.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b03_5']	《智度論》云「譬如震雷，小鳥聞皆怖，孔雀大鳥聞之舞踊」也。	《智度論》云「譬如震雷，小鳥聞皆怖，孔雀大鳥聞之舞踊」也。	008	The Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says it is like thunder, when small birds hear it they all become frightened, but when the great bird, the peacock, hears it, it dances with joy.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b06_1']	若言終歸於空是灰身滅智空，八地已上菩薩豈生歡喜也。	若言終歸於空是灰身滅智空，八地已上菩薩豈生歡喜也。	008	If it is said that ultimately returning to emptiness is the emptiness of extinguishing the body and wisdom, how could bodhisattvas from the eighth ground onward give rise to joy?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b07_13']	「如是迦葉」下，第二，一行半，明理唯是一隨緣得益為異，兼合上同異譬也。	「如是迦葉」下，第二，一行半，明理唯是一隨緣得益為異，兼合上同異譬也。	008	Thus it is, Kāśyapa - the second part, one and a half lines, clarifies that the principle is only one, but the benefits obtained are different according to conditions, and it also combines the above simile of sameness and difference.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b09_5']	故同異譬受潤增長二章兼合之，蓋是轉勢之意，不應一一依長行也。	故同異譬受潤增長二章兼合之，蓋是轉勢之意，不應一一依長行也。	008	Therefore, the parables of sameness and difference combine the two chapters on receiving moisture and growth. This is the meaning of changing the approach, and one should not follow the prose section one by one.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b10_2']	「迦葉當知」下，第三，一行半，稱歎諸佛。	「迦葉當知」下，第三，一行半，稱歎諸佛。	008	Kāśyapa, you should know... - the third, one and a half lines, praise the buddhas.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b19_7']	「汝等所行是菩薩道」者，謂發菩提心退已還發，前所修行善根不滅，同後得果故，此意明本菩提心不滅，故此善根即無上種子，由此種子故今聞《法華》，即是雲雨後得成佛。	「汝等所行是菩薩道」者，謂發菩提心退已還發，前所修行善根不滅，同後得果故，此意明本菩提心不滅，故此善根即無上種子，由此種子故今聞《法華》，即是雲雨後得成佛。	008	The practices you are engaged in are the bodhisattva path means that after regressing from the aspiration for enlightenment, one arouses it again, and the previously cultivated wholesome roots are not extinguished, the same as the later attainment of fruition. This means that the original aspiration for enlightenment is not extinguished, so these wholesome roots are the seeds of unsurpassed enlightenment. Because of these seeds, now hearing the Lotus Sutra is the later attainment of buddhahood, like the clouds and rain.

Since bestowing predictions is the essential meaning of the Lotus Sutra and also the great purport of many sutras, I will now briefly explain it by opening it into seven sections:

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b26_1']	七、同異門。	七、同異門。	008	Seventh, the gate of sameness and difference.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b26_17']	初來意門者，為中根說法凡有四門：	初來意門者，為中根說法凡有四門：	008	As for the first gate of purpose, it is to speak the Dharma for those of middling faculties in four ways:

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b27_6', 'ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b27_11']	次、領解；🔽三、述成；	次、領解； 三、述成；	008	Next, understanding;🔽Third, praise;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b27_16']	四、授記。	四、授記。	008	Fourth, predictions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b27_22']	今即第四也。	今即第四也。	008	This is the fourth.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565b29_18']	以領解十譬十恩於前，以八法八譬述成於後，其心安泰即當果可記，所以如來為其授記也。	以領解十譬十恩於前，以八法八譬述成於後，其心安泰即當果可記，所以如來為其授記也。	008	Because of understanding the ten parables and ten kinds of kindness above, and praising with the eight dharmas and eight parables below, their minds are at ease and can be predicted, so the Tathāgata makes predictions for them.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c03_12']	依《法華論》意者，自上三品破凡夫、二乘、菩薩三病，即悟非凡非聖、非大非小，得無依正觀行，與佛相應故授以佛記也。	依《法華論》意者，自上三品破凡夫、二乘、菩薩三病，即悟非凡非聖、非大非小，得無依正觀行，與佛相應故授以佛記也。	008	As for the meaning according to the Fahua lun, from the above three chapters, the three illnesses of ordinary beings, two vehicles, and bodhisattvas are eliminated, and they immediately realize that they are neither ordinary nor holy, neither great nor small, and attain the correct contemplation and practice, which accords with the Buddha, so they are given the prediction of becoming a Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c04_17']	若望今昔二病除者，昔執異不知同，今即執同不知異；	若望今昔二病除者，昔執異不知同，今即執同不知異；	008	If we look at the elimination of the two illnesses of past and present, in the past they clung to differences and did not know sameness, and now they cling to sameness and do not know differences;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c08_6']	若了前同異譬意，即今昔病得除，便悟至道未曾同異，善巧方便同異適緣，以悟未曾同異即生於實慧，了隨緣同異即生方便慧，具足二慧即佛道可成。	若了前同異譬意，即今昔病得除，便悟至道未曾同異，善巧方便同異適緣，以悟未曾同異即生於實慧，了隨緣同異即生方便慧，具足二慧即佛道可成。	008	If one understands the meaning of the previous similes of sameness and difference, then the illness of past and present is cured, and one realizes the ultimate truth that has never been the same or different. Skillful means adapts to conditions of sameness and difference, and by realizing that it has never been the same or different, one gives rise to true wisdom. Understanding the sameness and difference that accords with conditions gives rise to skillful means wisdom. Endowed with the two wisdoms, the Buddha Way can be accomplished.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c10_1']	故《淨名經》云「智度菩薩母、方便為父」，父母具足則當成法身，故與授佛記也。	故《淨名經》云「智度菩薩母、方便為父」，父母具足則當成法身，故與授佛記也。	008	Therefore, the Vimalakīrti Sūtra says, Prajñā is the mother of bodhisattvas, and skillful means is the father. When the parents are complete, the Dharma body will be attained, and thus the prediction of Buddhahood is given.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c11_16']	若接品末生者，上品末開方便門、示真實相，諸聲聞眾皆非滅度，謂開方便門；	若接品末生者，上品末開方便門、示真實相，諸聲聞眾皆非滅度，謂開方便門；	008	If it is connected to the end of the chapter on birth, at the end of the previous chapter, the gate of skillful means is opened and the true aspect is revealed. The assembly of śrāvakas are all not in final nirvāṇa, which is opening the gate of skillful means;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c12_11']	汝等所行是菩薩道，謂示真實相。	汝等所行是菩薩道，謂示真實相。	008	The practice you are engaged in is the bodhisattva path, which is revealing the true aspect.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c13_10']	昔不悟大因為小果，故執小果而迷大因；	昔不悟大因為小果，故執小果而迷大因；	008	In the past, they did not realize that the great cause is the small fruition, and thus they clung to the small fruition and were confused about the great cause;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c14_19']	今悟小果是大因，故便有大因，有大因必得大果，故授以佛記也。	今悟小果是大因，故便有大因，有大因必得大果，故授以佛記也。	008	Now realizing that the small fruition is a great cause, therefore there is a great cause, and having a great cause will certainly attain a great fruition, thus the Buddha bestows the prediction.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c15_14']	二、釋名門者，「授」者云與也。	二、釋名門者，「授」者云與也。	008	Second, in the explanation of the name section, bestow means to give.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c16_2']	「記」者云決也，亦云莂也。	「記」者云決也，亦云莂也。	008	Prediction means to determine, or to predict.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c17_6']	所言決者，於九道內分決此人必當成佛，故云決也。	所言決者，於九道內分決此人必當成佛，故云決也。	008	As for the term determine, it means to determine within the nine paths that this person will certainly attain Buddhahood, thus it is called determine.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c17_11']	莂義亦然。	莂義亦然。	008	The meaning of predict is also the same.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c18_15']	懸說未來事以授前人，故名授記，前人領受故云受記。	懸說未來事以授前人，故名授記，前人領受故云受記。	008	It is called bestow prediction because future events are spoken of and bestowed upon others, and it is called receive prediction because the other person accepts it.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c19_4']	又汎論記無記有三：	又汎論記無記有三：	008	Furthermore, generally speaking, there are three kinds of predictions:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c20_16']	一、就三性門論記無記，若有善惡可記故名為記，無善惡可記故名無記。	一、就三性門論記無記，若有善惡可記故名為記，無善惡可記故名無記。	008	First, discussing predictions and non-predictions from the perspective of the three natures, if there is good or evil that can be predicted, it is called a prediction, and if there is no good or evil that can be predicted, it is called a non-prediction.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c22_16']	二、善惡能感苦樂果，有苦樂果可記名為記，無記不能感苦樂果，無果可記故名無記。	二、善惡能感苦樂果，有苦樂果可記名為記，無記不能感苦樂果，無果可記故名無記。	008	Second, good and evil can lead to suffering and happiness, and if there is a suffering and happiness that can be predicted, it is called a prediction. Non-predictions cannot lead to suffering and happiness, and since there is no result that can be predicted, it is called a non-prediction.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c24_13']	三者、有物可記故名有記，無物可記故名無記，如《華嚴》以十四難為無記門也。	三者、有物可記故名有記，無物可記故名無記，如《華嚴》以十四難為無記門也。	008	Third, it is called with record because there is something to be recorded, and it is called without record because there is nothing to be recorded. In the Huayan, the fourteen difficult points are taken as the gate of without record.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c25_14']	即是無物可記故名無記也，如石女無兒可記也；	即是無物可記故名無記也，如石女無兒可記也；	008	This is because there is nothing to be recorded, so it is called without record. It is like a barren woman having no child to be recorded.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c26_5']	而與此相違故名有記。	而與此相違故名有記。	008	It is the opposite of this, so it is called with record.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c27_16']	今云修佛因得佛果，即是有果可記故名為記，聖記示人稱為授記也。	今云修佛因得佛果，即是有果可記故名為記，聖記示人稱為授記也。	008	Now, it is said that cultivating the causes of Buddhahood and attaining the fruit of Buddhahood is having a fruit that can be recorded, so it is called with record. The sages' predictions are called giving predictions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0565c28_12']	又釋記者言錄，示果有可記錄也。	又釋記者言錄，示果有可記錄也。	008	Another explanation is that record means recording words, indicating that there is a fruit that can be recorded.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566a02_5']	一者、佛授記；	一者、佛授記；	008	First, the Buddha gives predictions;
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566a02_15']	二、常不輕菩薩授記。	二、常不輕菩薩授記。	008	Second, the Bodhisattva of Constant Light gives predictions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566a03_8']	此二不同者，佛具授通、別兩記。	此二不同者，佛具授通、別兩記。	008	These two are different. The Buddha gives both general and specific predictions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566a05_11']	言別記者，如來具三達智，知此人未來成佛久近，故與其劫數之記，如授三根人記等，故名別記。	言別記者，如來具三達智，知此人未來成佛久近，故與其劫數之記，如授三根人記等，故名別記。	008	As for specific predictions, the Tathāgata, possessing the three kinds of knowledge, knows how long it will take for a person to attain Buddhahood in the future, and therefore gives them a prediction of the number of eons, like the prediction given to those of the three capacities. Therefore it is called a specific prediction.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566a07_18']	言通記者，如〈法師品〉云「聞《法華經》一念隨喜皆與授記」，而不說其劫數久近，以去佛道長遠義故但與通記。	言通記者，如〈法師品〉云「聞《法華經》一念隨喜皆與授記」，而不說其劫數久近，以去佛道長遠義故但與通記。	008	As for general predictions, as the Dharma Teacher Chapter says, Those who hear the Lotus Sutra and rejoice in it for a single thought will all be given predictions, but it does not speak of the length of the eons, because the meaning of the long distance to the Buddha Way is used. It only gives a general prediction.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566a09_8']	常不輕菩薩迹居因位、三達未圓，故但得與通記不得授別記也。	常不輕菩薩迹居因位、三達未圓，故但得與通記不得授別記也。	008	The Bodhisattva of Constant Light, whose traces are in the stage of causes, and whose three kinds of knowledge are not yet complete, therefore only receives a general prediction and does not receive a specific prediction.

They are therefore not worthy of receiving predictions, nor are they worthy of having their attachments broken and being brought back to the truth. Yet this sutra brings together all the Two Vehicles to become Buddhas. This sutra is spoken for the sake of those who are to be enlightened, to clarify the meaning of breaking attachments and bringing them back to the truth.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566a22_11']	增上慢亦爾，如五千之徒不堪聞於破會，以根未熟故；	增上慢亦爾，如五千之徒不堪聞於破會，以根未熟故；	008	The same is true of the overweening pride. Those of the five thousand who were unable to hear the breaking of the assembly were not yet ripe in their faculties,

As the Nirvāṇa Sūtra clarifies, those who should be given a slow prediction are given a slow one. If that person hears that they will quickly attain Buddhahood, they will give rise to a conceited mind, so they are given a slow prediction.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c01_3']	三者、前後得記前後成佛，如四大聲聞是也。	三者、前後得記前後成佛，如四大聲聞是也。	008	Third, receiving the prediction and attaining Buddhahood sequentially, like the four great śrāvakas.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c02_4', 'ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c05_3']	又有四句：🔽一者、小乘無優劣、大乘有優劣，如五百弟子同時成羅漢，故小乘無優劣，而轉次成佛，如初人成佛竟授第二人記，故大乘有優劣。	又有四句： 一者、小乘無優劣、大乘有優劣，如五百弟子同時成羅漢，故小乘無優劣，而轉次成佛，如初人成佛竟授第二人記，故大乘有優劣。	008	There are also four statements:🔽First, the Hīnayāna has no superiority or inferiority, while the Mahāyāna has superiority and inferiority. Like the five hundred disciples who simultaneously attained arhatship, so the Hīnayāna has no superiority or inferiority. But in turning to become Buddhas, like the first person who becomes a Buddha and then bestows the prediction on the second person, so the Mahāyāna has superiority and inferiority.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c07_8']	二者、小乘有優劣、大乘無優劣，如學無學二千人，有學無學故小乘有優劣，同時成佛故大乘無優劣。	二者、小乘有優劣、大乘無優劣，如學無學二千人，有學無學故小乘有優劣，同時成佛故大乘無優劣。	008	Second, the Hīnayāna has superiority and inferiority, while the Mahāyāna has no superiority or inferiority. Like the two thousand learners and non-learners, having learners and non-learners, so the Hīnayāna has superiority and inferiority. But attaining Buddhahood simultaneously, so the Mahāyāna has no superiority or inferiority.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c09_17']	三者、小乘劣、大乘勝，如阿難住初果故劣，羅云得第四果故勝，而阿難在前成佛，羅云在後成佛，故大乘勝。	三者、小乘劣、大乘勝，如阿難住初果故劣，羅云得第四果故勝，而阿難在前成佛，羅云在後成佛，故大乘勝。	008	Third, the Lesser Vehicle is inferior and the Great Vehicle is superior. For example, Ānanda abided in the first fruit and was therefore inferior, while Rāhula attained the fourth fruit and was superior. Yet Ānanda became a Buddha first, while Rāhula became a Buddha later. Therefore, the Great Vehicle is superior.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c12_1']	四者、小乘勝、大乘劣，則羅云得第四果故勝，阿難在學地故劣，而阿難在前、羅云在後則其事也。	四者、小乘勝、大乘劣，則羅云得第四果故勝，阿難在學地故劣，而阿難在前、羅云在後則其事也。	008	Fourth, the Lesser Vehicle is superior and the Great Vehicle is inferior. For example, Rāhula attained the fourth fruit and was therefore superior, while Ānanda was still in the stage of learning and was inferior. Yet Ānanda became a Buddha first, while Rāhula became a Buddha later. This is the matter.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c14_3']	何故經中呵受記，如淨名破彌勒三世門中無受記、無生法中亦無受記，今何故說受記耶？	何故經中呵受記，如淨名破彌勒三世門中無受記、無生法中亦無受記，今何故說受記耶？	008	Why did the sūtras criticize receiving predictions? For example, Vimalakīrti refuted Maitreya's approach of the three times, saying there is no receiving predictions within the Dharma of non-arising. Why then does [the author] now speak of receiving predictions?
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c14_5']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c16_3']	《淨名經》為破有所得病，言人為能受、法為所受，佛為能授、菩薩為所授，是故破無受記。	《淨名經》為破有所得病，言人為能受、法為所受，佛為能授、菩薩為所授，是故破無受記。	008	The Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra is to break the illness of grasping at existence, saying that a person is the receiver and the Dharma is what is received, the Buddha is the giver and the bodhisattva is the receiver. Therefore, it refutes the non-existence of receiving predictions.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c17_7']	今為對聲聞人言羅漢不成佛，是故與其成佛之記也。	今為對聲聞人言羅漢不成佛，是故與其成佛之記也。	008	Now, in response to the disciples, it is said that arhats do not become buddhas, and therefore they are given the prediction of becoming buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c19_10']	又彼經明不見能受所受、能記所記，故則不得記，今經明記無所記故云授記，二經不相違也。	又彼經明不見能受所受、能記所記，故則不得記，今經明記無所記故云授記，二經不相違也。	008	Moreover, that sūtra clarifies that one who cannot receive or accept, who cannot predict or be predicted, therefore does not receive the prediction. Now, this sūtra clarifies that because there is no prediction to be predicted, it is said to be the bestowal of prediction. The two sūtras are not contradictory.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0566c21_12']	又佛法有二諦，如來常依二諦說法，依世諦門說法故有授記，依第一義諦門說法故無授記也。	又佛法有二諦，如來常依二諦說法，依世諦門說法故有授記，依第一義諦門說法故無授記也。	008	Moreover, the Buddha's teachings have two truths. The Tathāgata always relies on the two truths to expound the Dharma. Relying on the gate of conventional truth to expound the Dharma, therefore there is the bestowal of prediction. Relying on the gate of ultimate truth to expound the Dharma, therefore there is no bestowal of prediction.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0568c26_7']	一者、根有利鈍異。	一者、根有利鈍異。	008	First, the faculties are different in being sharp or dull.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0568c27_20']	二者、修因短長異，聲聞極疾三世，極遲六十劫，緣覺極疾四世，極遲百劫。	二者、修因短長異，聲聞極疾三世，極遲六十劫，緣覺極疾四世，極遲百劫。	008	Second, the length of time spent cultivating causes differs. For śrāvakas, the shortest is three lifetimes, the longest is sixty eons. For pratyekabuddhas, the shortest is four lifetimes, the longest is a hundred eons.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0568c28_19']	三者、時異，聲聞與佛同世，緣覺與佛異世。	三者、時異，聲聞與佛同世，緣覺與佛異世。	008	Third, the time differs. Śrāvakas and Buddhas are in the same era, while pratyekabuddhas and Buddhas are in different eras.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a02_10']	四者、有悲無悲異，如《智度論》，三獸被圍，聲聞如鹿，但免自身，是故無悲，緣覺如羊，雖得出圍迴顧念子，則有少悲。	四者、有悲無悲異，如《智度論》，三獸被圍，聲聞如鹿，但免自身，是故無悲，緣覺如羊，雖得出圍迴顧念子，則有少悲。	008	Fourth, there is the difference between having compassion and not having compassion. As the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, Three animals are surrounded, the śrāvaka is like a deer, only escaping its own body, therefore it has no compassion, the pratyekabuddha is like a sheep, although it escapes the encirclement, it looks back at its young, then it has a little compassion.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a04_7']	五者、福德厚薄異，緣覺身必有相好，但或具足不具足，聲聞身或有相好或無相好。	五者、福德厚薄異，緣覺身必有相好，但或具足不具足，聲聞身或有相好或無相好。	008	Fifth, there is the difference in the thickness of blessings and virtues. The body of a pratyekabuddha must have the major and minor marks, but they may be complete or incomplete. The body of a śrāvaka may or may not have the major and minor marks.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a06_2']	六者、有印字無印字異，緣覺手中有十二因緣印字，聲聞手中無四諦印字。	六者、有印字無印字異，緣覺手中有十二因緣印字，聲聞手中無四諦印字。	008	Sixth, there is the difference between having the seal of the twelve links of dependent arising in the palm and not having the seal of the four truths in the palm.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a07_15']	七者、現通說法異，聲聞多為人說法，緣覺多為人現通，假令說法唯說一偈。	七者、現通說法異，聲聞多為人說法，緣覺多為人現通，假令說法唯說一偈。	008	Seventh, the difference in manifesting spiritual powers and expounding the Dharma. The śrāvaka often expounds the Dharma for people, while the pratyekabuddha often manifests spiritual powers for people. Even if he expounds the Dharma, he only expounds a single verse.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a09_17']	八者、利益淺深異，聲聞說法能令人得七賢七聖，緣覺說法不能令人得燸法、頂法乃至羅漢。	八者、利益淺深異，聲聞說法能令人得七賢七聖，緣覺說法不能令人得燸法、頂法乃至羅漢。	008	Eighth, the difference in the depth of benefits. The śrāvaka's expounding of the Dharma can enable people to attain the seven sages and seven worthies, while the pratyekabuddha's expounding of the Dharma cannot enable people to attain the stage of heat, the stage of summit, up to arhatship.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a12_17']	所以然者，聲聞與佛同世，眾生福德利根故聞說教法得成聖果，緣覺出無佛世，眾生薄福鈍根，雖聞說法不能深悟亦不堪多說也。	所以然者，聲聞與佛同世，眾生福德利根故聞說教法得成聖果，緣覺出無佛世，眾生薄福鈍根，雖聞說法不能深悟亦不堪多說也。	008	The reason for this is that the śrāvaka is in the same world as the Buddha, and because sentient beings have the blessings and sharp faculties, they can attain the holy fruits by hearing the teachings. The pratyekabuddha appears in a world without a Buddha, and sentient beings have little blessings and dull faculties. Even if they hear the teachings, they cannot deeply understand them, and they are also unable to hear much.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a14_18']	九者、境界異，聲聞天眼依《智度》及《雜心》以二千世界為境界，緣覺天眼以三千世界為境界。	九者、境界異，聲聞天眼依《智度》及《雜心》以二千世界為境界，緣覺天眼以三千世界為境界。	008	Ninth, the difference in the scope. The śrāvaka's heavenly eye, according to the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra and the Saṃyuktâbhidharmahṛdaya, takes the two-thousand-fold world-system as its scope. The pratyekabuddha's heavenly eye takes the three-thousand-fold world-system as its scope.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a15_20']	十者、出處異，聲聞出於人世，緣覺隱處山林。	十者、出處異，聲聞出於人世，緣覺隱處山林。	008	Tenth, the difference in their origins: śrāvakas emerge in the human world, while pratyekabuddhas hide in the mountains and forests.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a17_2']	十一者、漸頓異，聲聞漸得四果，緣覺頓證一果也。	十一者、漸頓異，聲聞漸得四果，緣覺頓證一果也。	008	Eleventh, the difference in gradual and sudden: śrāvakas gradually attain the four fruits, while pratyekabuddhas suddenly realize the one fruit.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a18_17']	二者、出義同，同出三界。	二者、出義同，同出三界。	008	Second, the same in the meaning of leaving, the same in leaving the three realms.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a19_21']	三者、智同，依《大品》同得一切智，依小乘同得盡無生。	三者、智同，依《大品》同得一切智，依小乘同得盡無生。	008	Third, the same in wisdom, according to the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, the same in attaining omniscience; according to the Hīnayāna, the same in attaining the knowledge of exhaustion and non-arising.

['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a25_7']	據譬而言，子在宅內、車在門外，就說法輪作譬，父虛指門外明有三車，諸子出門不見有三。	據譬而言，子在宅內、車在門外，就說法輪作譬，父虛指門外明有三車，諸子出門不見有三。	008	In terms of the analogy, the children are in the house and the carts are outside the gate. In terms of the Dharma wheel, the father points to outside the gate to clarify that there are three carts, but the children do not see three when they go outside the gate.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a27_11']	此就今教為譬，欲顯道理無三，為成等賜大車義，故寄諸子出門不見有三，就父索三以顯無三。	此就今教為譬，欲顯道理無三，為成等賜大車義，故寄諸子出門不見有三，就父索三以顯無三。	008	This is an analogy based on the present teaching, to reveal that the principle is without three, in order to establish the meaning of equally bestowing the great cart. Therefore, it relies on the children going outside the gate and not seeing three, and on the children asking the father for three to reveal the absence of three.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569a28_17']	城就神通輪為譬，城在逈道無物隔之，同侶諸子舉目便見。	城就神通輪為譬，城在逈道無物隔之，同侶諸子舉目便見。	008	The city is an analogy for the spiritual powers wheel. The city is on a steep road with nothing obstructing it, and the companions and children can see it as soon as they raise their eyes.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569b01_2']	此就昔教為言，明眾人欲退，故令其見城而入城也。	此就昔教為言，明眾人欲退，故令其見城而入城也。	008	This is a statement based on the past teaching, clarifying that the masses wanted to retreat, so it caused them to see the city and enter the city.
['ZH_T34_1721_008:0569b03_12']	若以城例車，昔既見城而入城，昔亦見車而乘車，車是涅槃，昔已證涅槃，如身子云「爾時心自謂得至於滅度」。	若以城例車，昔既見城而入城，昔亦見車而乘車，車是涅槃，昔已證涅槃，如身子云「爾時心自謂得至於滅度」。	008	If the city is compared to the cart, since they saw the city and entered the city in the past, they also saw the cart and rode in the cart in the past.
