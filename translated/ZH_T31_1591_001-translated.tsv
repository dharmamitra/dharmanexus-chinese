['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077b27_11']	由此義故，名為大乘。	由此義故，名為大乘。	001	For this reason, it is called the Great Vehicle.

['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077b29_15']	為得此故修唯識觀，是無過失方便正路。	為得此故修唯識觀，是無過失方便正路。	001	In order to attain this, one cultivates the contemplation of consciousness-only, which is the faultless correct path.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c03_1']	為此類故顯彼方便，於諸經中種種行相而廣宣說，如地水火風并所持物，品類難悉方處無邊。	為此類故顯彼方便，於諸經中種種行相而廣宣說，如地水火風并所持物，品類難悉方處無邊。	001	For this kind of person, the methods are revealed, and the various aspects of practice are extensively expounded in the sutras, like the earth, water, fire, wind, and the things they hold, the categories are difficult to know and the locations are boundless.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c04_4']	由此審知自心相現，遂於諸處捨其外相，遠離欣慼。	由此審知自心相現，遂於諸處捨其外相，遠離欣慼。	001	By this, one carefully understands the appearances of one's own mind, and then abandons the external appearances in various places, and is free from joy and sorrow.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c05_3']	復觀有海諠靜無差，棄彼小途絕大乘望。	復觀有海諠靜無差，棄彼小途絕大乘望。	001	Furthermore, observing that the sea of existence, whether turbulent or tranquil, is without distinction, one abandons the minor paths and cuts off the great vehicle's hope.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c06_7']	及於諸有耽著之類，觀若險崖深生怖畏，正趣中道。	及於諸有耽著之類，觀若險崖深生怖畏，正趣中道。	001	And for those who are attached to various existences, one observes them as if on a steep cliff, deeply giving rise to fear, and correctly proceeds on the middle way.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c08_8']	若知但是自心所作，無邊資糧易為積集，不待多時，如少用功能成大事，善逝行處猶若掌中。	若知但是自心所作，無邊資糧易為積集，不待多時，如少用功能成大事，善逝行處猶若掌中。	001	If one knows that this is merely created by one's own mind, the boundless provisions are easily accumulated, not waiting for many times, like using a small amount of function to accomplish great matters, the Tathāgata's place is like the palm of one's hand.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c09_8']	由斯理故，所有願求當能圓滿隨意而轉。	由斯理故，所有願求當能圓滿隨意而轉。	001	For this reason, all wishes and requests can be fully accomplished and turn as one wishes.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c11_2']	縱如所許有其外事，然由內心意樂慇重弘誓力故，能到無邊六度之岸。	縱如所許有其外事，然由內心意樂慇重弘誓力故，能到無邊六度之岸。	001	Even if there are external matters as promised, however, due to the sincere and earnest intention and vow power of the inner mind, one can reach the boundless shore of the six pāramitās.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c12_14']	若異此者，所捨之物盡持行施，及所遺生何能總遍，令其歡喜愜順求心。	若異此者，所捨之物盡持行施，及所遺生何能總遍，令其歡喜愜順求心。	001	If it were otherwise, the objects to be given would all be used for practicing giving, and as for the beings to be saved, how could one completely satisfy them, causing them to rejoice and comply with their seeking mind?
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c13_13']	此即便成無邊際境，所為施事無有竟期。	此即便成無邊際境，所為施事無有竟期。	001	This would then become a boundless realm, and the matter of giving would never end.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c16_5']	又復所有廣為利益有情戒等，於諸無障有情之類，隨彼樂欲悉能稱意，赴彼希望正行施等，速便收集正覺資糧。	又復所有廣為利益有情戒等，於諸無障有情之類，隨彼樂欲悉能稱意，赴彼希望正行施等，速便收集正覺資糧。	001	Moreover, all the precepts and so forth that are extensively practiced for the benefit of sentient beings, towards all unobstructed sentient beings, according to their desires, are able to satisfy their hopes and aspirations, and by practicing giving and so forth, quickly gather the provisions for perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c16_17']	由斯但自心，復何須外境。	由斯但自心，復何須外境。	001	Because of this, it is only the mind. What need is there for external objects?

['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c19_1']	如仗自心妄生分別，作色等解、起身見等。	如仗自心妄生分別，作色等解、起身見等。	001	Just as, relying on one's own mind, one falsely generates discrimination and gives rise to the understanding of form and so forth, and gives rise to the view of the body and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c21_3']	無實，不待外諸有情而作所緣因生離染，然於施等各隨其事而能獲果，實不假藉識外境事。	無實，不待外諸有情而作所緣因生離染，然於施等各隨其事而能獲果，實不假藉識外境事。	001	Without reality, not waiting for external sentient beings to become the causes of objects, one gives rise to detachment. However, with regard to giving and so forth, one is able to obtain the fruits according to each matter, and it is truly not dependent on external objects.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c23_7']	若其識外有別境者，遂便依彼起諸煩惱，既被執取隨轉而住。	若其識外有別境者，遂便依彼起諸煩惱，既被執取隨轉而住。	001	If there are separate objects outside of consciousness, then one relies on them to give rise to various afflictions. Having been grasped and clung to, one abides in accordance with their transformations.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c24_7']	見此過已心捨離生，深懷厭棄不悕大覺。	見此過已心捨離生，深懷厭棄不悕大覺。	001	Seeing this fault, the mind gives rise to detachment and deeply harbors disgust, not longing for great enlightenment.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c25_1']	既捨有情界，如何欲弘益？	既捨有情界，如何欲弘益？	001	Since you have abandoned the realm of sentient beings, how can you wish to promote their benefit?
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c26_1']	由非攝取諸有生類，小心自度大行難成。	由非攝取諸有生類，小心自度大行難成。	001	Because you do not take in all living beings, your small mind is self-liberated and the great practice is difficult to accomplish.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c27_16']	然諸覺情依斯而轉，方能長養菩提資糧，謂於客塵有為之事厭背心故證無為法。	然諸覺情依斯而轉，方能長養菩提資糧，謂於客塵有為之事厭背心故證無為法。	001	However, all enlightened beings rely on this to turn around and then are able to nurture the provisions for bodhi. This means that because the mind turns away from the conditioned affairs of guests and dust, one realizes the unconditioned Dharma.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0077c29_7']	由無為法體不生長故，希餘小寂偏證一邊，無上覺山遂便淪退。	由無為法體不生長故，希餘小寂偏證一邊，無上覺山遂便淪退。	001	Because the essence of the unconditioned Dharma is unborn and does not grow, one hopes for the other small tranquility and unilaterally realizes one side, and the mountain of unsurpassed enlightenment then sinks and retreats.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a01_6']	若無外境，愛厭俱亡，正覺之處斯成易得。	若無外境，愛厭俱亡，正覺之處斯成易得。	001	If there are no external objects, both attachment and aversion are gone, and the place of right enlightenment is easily attained.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a02_14', 'ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a04_7']	豈非大悲常存於念，菩提薩埵極果方成，唯識之言便為違害？🔽然而大悲要託他身為緣性故，既除外境但緣自識，此則便成怜自身故。	豈非大悲常存於念，菩提薩埵極果方成，唯識之言便為違害？ 然而大悲要託他身為緣性故，既除外境但緣自識，此則便成怜自身故。	001	Isn't it that great compassion always exists in thought, and the ultimate fruit of the bodhisattva is accomplished? The words of consciousness only then become harmful.🔽However, great compassion must rely on the body of another as the nature of conditions, so once external objects are removed and only one's own consciousness is relied upon, this then becomes compassion for one's own body.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a05_6']	利他為意大行方竪，唯顧己身寔乖弘度。	利他為意大行方竪，唯顧己身寔乖弘度。	001	Benefiting others is the intention, and the great practice is then established. Only caring for one's own body is truly contrary to the vast liberation.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a07_13']	雖陳雅責，因斯無過，藉外相續為增上緣，於自識中現有情相，緣此為境起大悲心，於有情處而作弘益。	雖陳雅責，因斯無過，藉外相續為增上緣，於自識中現有情相，緣此為境起大悲心，於有情處而作弘益。	001	Although you have stated your own views, there is no fault in this, because you rely on external continuity as the dominant condition, and in one's own consciousness there appear the characteristics of sentient beings. Taking this as the object, one gives rise to the mind of great compassion and brings great benefit to sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a08_8']	此無相違，決定如是，應起信心。	此無相違，決定如是，應起信心。	001	This is not contradictory, and it should be definitely believed to be so.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a10_5']	假令於彼色聲等處一一推求彼無其我，設使和集我亦不成，然而本性不可捨故。	假令於彼色聲等處一一推求彼無其我，設使和集我亦不成，然而本性不可捨故。	001	Even if one investigates each and every place of form, sound, etc., there is no self there. Even if they are combined, the self is still not established. However, because its inherent nature cannot be abandoned,
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a11_4']	既同所許無我為宗，當於何處欲興悲念？	既同所許無我為宗，當於何處欲興悲念？	001	since it is the same in accepting the thesis that there is no self, where does one want to give rise to compassion?
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a12_3']	於世共許當情妄執，為所緣相以為有情。	於世共許當情妄執，為所緣相以為有情。	001	In what is commonly accepted by the world, one falsely grasps it as the characteristics of the object and takes it as sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a12_16']	亦不應言情所執事即是外境。	亦不應言情所執事即是外境。	001	One should also not say that the things grasped by sentient beings are the external objects.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a15_1']	由此應知，假令不樂理必許然，但於自識現有情相，依仗斯事色相生焉，是故定知無其外境。	由此應知，假令不樂理必許然，但於自識現有情相，依仗斯事色相生焉，是故定知無其外境。	001	For this reason, one should know that even if one is unwilling to accept it, the principle must be so. One only manifests the characteristics of sentient beings in one's own consciousness. Relying on these things, the characteristics of form arise. Therefore, one definitely knows that there are no external objects.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a15_15']	若離於識必不可得，是顛倒故。	若離於識必不可得，是顛倒故。	001	If it is apart from consciousness, it must be unobtainable, because it is an inversion.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a15_20']	何謂顛倒？	何謂顛倒？	001	What is meant by inversion?
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a16_8']	本無外境見為實物。	本無外境見為實物。	001	Originally there is no external object, but it is seen as a real entity.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a17_8']	非妄執故，終能獲得無上之處，可為應理。	非妄執故，終能獲得無上之處，可為應理。	001	Because it is not a false grasping, one will eventually be able to attain the unsurpassed state, which can be reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a18_6']	唯識之見是真實故，為彼方便深成稱理。	唯識之見是真實故，為彼方便深成稱理。	001	The view of consciousness only is true, so it is a deep and fitting method.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a19_8']	如何得知斯為實見？	如何得知斯為實見？	001	How can one know that this is a true view?
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a19_17']	三界唯心是詮說故。	三界唯心是詮說故。	001	Because the statement the three realms are only mind is a definitive explanation.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a20_12']	凡有諍事欲求決定，須藉二門：	凡有諍事欲求決定，須藉二門：	001	Whenever there is a disputed matter and one seeks certainty, one must rely on two approaches:
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a21_3']	一順阿笈摩、二符正理。	一順阿笈摩、二符正理。	001	First, in accordance with the Agamas; second, in conformity with correct reasoning.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a23_1']	謂欲為彼信證聖人無倒宣說所有傳教引阿笈摩，若為此餘不信之者，應申正理。	謂欲為彼信證聖人無倒宣說所有傳教引阿笈摩，若為此餘不信之者，應申正理。	001	If one wishes to prove to those who have faith in the sages that their teachings are correctly proclaimed and transmitted, one should cite the Agamas. If one wishes to prove to those who do not have faith, one should use correct reasoning.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a24_6']	或可為彼二人俱陳兩事，如所信事令安住故陳其正理。	或可為彼二人俱陳兩事，如所信事令安住故陳其正理。	001	Or one may present both approaches to those two types of people, using correct reasoning to establish the matter that is believed.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a25_6']	又為顯其所論正理有依仗處說阿笈摩。	又為顯其所論正理有依仗處說阿笈摩。	001	Moreover, in order to show that the correct reasoning being discussed has a basis, the Agamas are cited.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a26_14']	由其正理不依傳教，未見真者所有言說無非謬故，名強思構。	由其正理不依傳教，未見真者所有言說無非謬故，名強思構。	001	Because their correct reasoning does not rely on the transmission of teachings, the statements of those who have not seen the truth are all erroneous, and therefore they are called forced fabrications.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a27_12']	是故應知阿笈摩者便成正理所託之處。	是故應知阿笈摩者便成正理所託之處。	001	Therefore, one should know that the Agamas become the basis of correct reasoning.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a28_12']	或於自部有力用故，為此先陳阿笈摩教。	或於自部有力用故，為此先陳阿笈摩教。	001	Or, because they are powerful and useful in one's own school, they are presented first as the teachings of the Agamas.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078a29_11']	爾來據義依大乘說，即第七聲目其所為。	爾來據義依大乘說，即第七聲目其所為。	001	From now on, according to the meaning, the Mahayana is explained, and the seventh sound indicates its purpose.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078b02_5']	謂欲證得彼大乘理說唯識觀是真實故，此不虛性，以阿笈摩善成立故。	謂欲證得彼大乘理說唯識觀是真實故，此不虛性，以阿笈摩善成立故。	001	That is to say, in order to realize the principle of the Mahayana, it is said that the contemplation of consciousness only is the truth, because this non-erroneous nature is well established by the Agamas.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078b03_13']	又若唯據言說大乘，猶如於義假名乘者，依第七聲所說聲也。	又若唯據言說大乘，猶如於義假名乘者，依第七聲所說聲也。	001	Moreover, if one only relies on the spoken Mahayana, like a vehicle designated according to meaning, it is the sound spoken based on the seventh sound.

In order to clarify the meaning of the established thesis, it cites a corner of the Mahāyāna teachings to illustrate the established thesis, and does not contradict one's own teachings.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078b07_17']	此復何故名阿笈摩，輒自引證說斯言耶？	此復何故名阿笈摩，輒自引證說斯言耶？	001	Why is it called āgama, and why does it cite this statement as evidence?
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078b10_1']	謂從能說如理教者，假彼相續為增上緣此教方生，於其聽者識之差別，體有功能現前而住。	謂從能說如理教者，假彼相續為增上緣此教方生，於其聽者識之差別，體有功能現前而住。	001	It is said that this teaching can only arise when the one who expounds the teachings in accordance with principle takes the continuity of the listener's consciousness as the dominant condition. The specific function of the teaching resides in the consciousness of the listener.

Because it comes from others, it is called āgama.
['ZH_T31_1591_001:0078b13_18']	若復有時自生憶念隨順本相識方生者，從彼生故得阿笈摩名。	若復有時自生憶念隨順本相識方生者，從彼生故得阿笈摩名。	001	If at some time one's own memory arises and the consciousness arises in accordance with the original characteristics, because it arises from that, it is given the name āgama.

It is because you previously allowed that mind, thought, and consciousness are synonymous, but due to the same substance and function, the names are not used together, so the different names are used to proclaim their meaning.

It is clear that the words “and so on” are used for the other aggregates in order to exclude mental activities.

The term consciousness is placed in this [state] according to the principle of following the cow's horn.
