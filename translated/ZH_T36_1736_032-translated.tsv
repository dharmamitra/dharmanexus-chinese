['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241b22_4']	一相違義、二不相礙義、三相作義。	一相違義、二不相礙義、三相作義。	The first is the meaning of mutual contradiction, the second is the meaning of non-obstruction, and the third is the meaning of mutual creation.

['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c01_9']	謂何以無性得成空義？	謂何以無性得成空義？	It is asked: Why can naturelessness accomplish the meaning of emptiness?

['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c02_3']	由從緣生，所以無性。	由從緣生，所以無性。	Because it arises from conditions, therefore it is natureless.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c02_17']	是故緣生無性，是空之所以也。	是故緣生無性，是空之所以也。	Therefore, the naturelessness of dependent arising is the reason for emptiness.

['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c04_15']	特由無定性故，方始從緣而成幻有，是故無性是有所以。	特由無定性故，方始從緣而成幻有，是故無性是有所以。	Precisely because of having no fixed nature, it then begins to arise from conditions and become illusory existence. Therefore, naturelessness is the reason for existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c06_9']	故《中論．四諦品》云「若人不知空、不知空因緣，及不知空義，是故自生惱。	故《中論．四諦品》云「若人不知空、不知空因緣，及不知空義，是故自生惱。	Therefore, the Madhyamaka-kārikā, chapter on the Four Truths, says: If a person does not know emptiness, does not know the causes and conditions of emptiness, and does not know the meaning of emptiness, he will therefore give rise to distress himself.

Therefore, it is said: because of dependent arising it is called existence, because of dependent arising it is called emptiness;
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c09_7']	無性故名有，無性故名空。	無性故名有，無性故名空。	Because of having no nature, it is called existence. Because of having no nature, it is called emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c10_15']	良以諸法起必從緣，從緣有故必無自性，由無性故所以從緣。	良以諸法起必從緣，從緣有故必無自性，由無性故所以從緣。	It is because all dharmas arise necessarily from conditions. Because they exist from conditions, they necessarily have no self-nature. Because of having no nature, they therefore arise from conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c12_10']	緣有性無，更無二法，而約幻有萬類差殊故名俗諦，無性一味故名真諦。	緣有性無，更無二法，而約幻有萬類差殊故名俗諦，無性一味故名真諦。	Conditions have nature, but there is no second dharma. However, because the myriad distinctions of illusory existence are different, it is called the conventional truth. Because of having no nature and being of one flavor, it is called the truth of ultimate reality.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c13_15', 'ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c15_5']	又所以四句，唯第三句引證成者，無性故有，理難顯故。🔽若具證者，一緣生故有者，《法華》云「但以因緣有，從顛倒生故說。	又所以四句，唯第三句引證成者，無性故有，理難顯故。 若具證者，一緣生故有者，《法華》云「但以因緣有，從顛倒生故說。	Moreover, the reason for the four statements is that only the third statement cites evidence to prove it, because existence due to having no nature is difficult to understand.🔽If it is fully evidenced, the first statement existence because of arising from conditions is as the Lotus Sutra says, It is only because of causes and conditions that it arises from delusion.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c17_4']	」《淨名》云「以因緣故諸法生」，《中論》云「未曾有一法，不從因緣生」等，皆因緣故有義也。	」《淨名》云「以因緣故諸法生」，《中論》云「未曾有一法，不從因緣生」等，皆因緣故有義也。	The Vimalakīrti Sutra says, All dharmas arise because of causes and conditions. The Middle Treatise says, There is never a single dharma that does not arise from causes and conditions. These all mean the meaning of existence because of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c18_19']	「二緣生故空」者，經云「因緣所生無有生」，論云「若法從緣生，是則無自性。	「二緣生故空」者，經云「因緣所生無有生」，論云「若法從緣生，是則無自性。	Empty because of the arising of the two conditions means the sutra says What arises from conditions has no arising, and the treatise says If a dharma arises from conditions, then it has no intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c19_10']	若無自性者，云何有是法？	若無自性者，云何有是法？	If it has no intrinsic nature, how can it be a dharma?

['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c21_14']	由前諸品以空遣有，小乘便為菩薩立過云：	由前諸品以空遣有，小乘便為菩薩立過云：	Because the previous chapters use emptiness to eliminate existence, the Lesser Vehicle then establishes a fault for the Bodhisattva, saying:
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c22_18']	若一切法空無生無滅者，如是則無有四聖諦之法。	若一切法空無生無滅者，如是則無有四聖諦之法。	If all dharmas are empty, without arising and without ceasing, then there would be no dharma of the Four Noble Truths.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c23_5']	菩薩反答云：	菩薩反答云：	The Bodhisattva responds in reverse, saying:
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c24_8']	若一切不空無生無滅者，如是則無有四聖諦之法。	若一切不空無生無滅者，如是則無有四聖諦之法。	If all are not empty, without arising and without ceasing, then there would be no dharma of the Four Noble Truths.
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c27_2']	謂小乘以空故無四諦，菩薩以不空故則無四諦，若有空義四諦方成，故有偈云「以有空義故，一切法得成；	謂小乘以空故無四諦，菩薩以不空故則無四諦，若有空義四諦方成，故有偈云「以有空義故，一切法得成；	This means that the Lesser Vehicle says the Four Noble Truths do not exist because of emptiness, while the Bodhisattva says the Four Noble Truths do not exist because of non-emptiness. If there is the meaning of emptiness, only then can the Four Noble Truths be established. Therefore there is a verse that says Because of the meaning of emptiness, all dharmas are established;
['ZH_T36_1736_032:0241c27_14']	若無空義者，一切則不成。	若無空義者，一切則不成。	If there were no meaning of emptiness, everything would not be established.

Because there is the cause of defiled dharmas of ignorance, it then perfumes the true nature. Because of perfuming, there is the deluded mind. Because there is the deluded mind, it then perfumes ignorance. Because of not understanding the true nature of dharmas, deluded thoughts arise and manifest deluded objects. Because there are the conditions of defiled dharmas of deluded objects, it then perfumes the deluded mind, causing it to be attached to thoughts and create various karmas, and experience all the suffering of body and mind, etc.

Because this originally enlightened one internally perfumes the unenlightened, causing them to become disgusted, seek, reverse the flow, and accord with the truth, it is called function.
