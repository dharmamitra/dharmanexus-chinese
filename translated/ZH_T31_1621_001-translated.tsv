['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b15_1']	謂於三界但有假名，實無外境，由妄執故。	謂於三界但有假名，實無外境，由妄執故。	001	It is said that within the three realms there are only provisional names, and there are no real external objects. This is due to false grasping.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b16_9']	今欲為彼未證真者，決擇諸法自性之門，令無倒解，故造斯論。	今欲為彼未證真者，決擇諸法自性之門，令無倒解，故造斯論。	001	Now, for those who have not yet realized the truth, I wish to discern the gate of the self-nature of all dharmas, causing them to understand without error. Therefore, this treatise is composed.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b17_0']	於繩作蛇解，　　見繩知境無，	於繩作蛇解，　　見繩知境無，	001	Regarding a rope, one imagines it to be a snake. Seeing the rope, one knows that the object is nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b18_13']	若了彼分時，　　知如蛇解謬。	若了彼分時，　　知如蛇解謬。	001	If one understands its aspects at that time, one knows that the understanding of it as a snake is mistaken.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b20_20']	如於非遠不分明處唯見繩蛇相似之事，未能了彼差別自性，被惑亂故，定執為蛇。	如於非遠不分明處唯見繩蛇相似之事，未能了彼差別自性，被惑亂故，定執為蛇。	001	In a place that is not far but not clearly visible, one only sees something resembling a rope and a snake. One is not yet able to understand their distinct self-natures, and because one is deluded, one definitely grasps them as a snake.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b22_7']	後時了彼差別法已，知由妄執誑亂生故，但是錯解無有實事。	後時了彼差別法已，知由妄執誑亂生故，但是錯解無有實事。	001	Later, after understanding their distinct characteristics, one knows that because of false grasping and delusion, [the snake] is merely a mistaken understanding and does not actually exist.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b23_11']	復於繩處支分差別善觀察時，繩之自體亦不可得。	復於繩處支分差別善觀察時，繩之自體亦不可得。	001	Furthermore, when carefully observing the distinctions in the rope's parts, the rope's own substance is also unobtainable.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b24_11']	如是知已，所有繩解，猶如蛇覺，唯有妄識。	如是知已，所有繩解，猶如蛇覺，唯有妄識。	001	Knowing this, all understanding of the rope is like the perception of a snake, existing only in false consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884b26_15']	如於繩處有惑亂識，亦於彼分毫釐等處知相假藉、無實可得，是故緣繩及分等心所有相狀但唯妄識。	如於繩處有惑亂識，亦於彼分毫釐等處知相假藉、無實可得，是故緣繩及分等心所有相狀但唯妄識。	001	Just as there is a deluded consciousness regarding the rope, one should also know that regarding its individual strands, etc., the characteristics are mutually dependent and ultimately unobtainable. Therefore, the characteristics of the mind that takes the rope and its parts as objects are merely false consciousness.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c02_11']	如於繩等支分之處別別分析審觀察時，知無實體，唯是妄心。	如於繩等支分之處別別分析審觀察時，知無實體，唯是妄心。	001	Just as when carefully observing and analyzing the individual parts of a rope, one knows that they have no real substance, but are only false mind.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c04_15']	如是應知，一切諸法但是假名，如瓶衣等物藉埿縷等成，乃至言說識所行境未至破壞名為瓶等。	如是應知，一切諸法但是假名，如瓶衣等物藉埿縷等成，乃至言說識所行境未至破壞名為瓶等。	001	One should understand in the same way that all dharmas are merely provisional names, like pots, clothes, etc., which depend on clay, thread, etc. to be formed. Up to the realm of consciousness that engages in verbal expression, before being destroyed, is called a pot, etc.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c05_17']	言「從他」者，謂從世俗言說而有，非於勝義。	言「從他」者，謂從世俗言說而有，非於勝義。	001	As for following others, it means that [the existence of things] is due to worldly conventions, not in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c05_20']	頌曰：	頌曰：	001	Verse:
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c06_0']	無分非見故，　　至極同非有，	無分非見故，　　至極同非有，	001	Because they are not seen, up to the ultimate, they are not existent,
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c07_13']	但由惑亂心，　　智者不應執。	但由惑亂心，　　智者不應執。	001	Only due to a deluded mind, the wise should not grasp at them.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c11_5']	若復執云諸有假事至極微位不可分析、復無方分是實有者，此即猶如空花及兔角等，不可見故、無力能生緣彼識故，所執極微定非實有。	若復執云諸有假事至極微位不可分析、復無方分是實有者，此即猶如空花及兔角等，不可見故、無力能生緣彼識故，所執極微定非實有。	001	If one further grasps at the idea that all nominally existent things, down to the ultimate subtle particles, cannot be analyzed and are partless and truly existent, then this is just like empty flowers and the horns of a rabbit, because they cannot be seen and have no power to give rise to the cognition that takes them as objects, the grasped at subtle particles definitely do not truly exist.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c12_9']	所以須說不可見因，由彼不能安立極微成實有故。	所以須說不可見因，由彼不能安立極微成實有故。	001	The reason for needing to explain the reason why they cannot be seen is because they cannot establish the subtle particles as truly existent.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c12_14']	所以者何？	所以者何？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c13_4']	由有方分事差別故。	由有方分事差別故。	001	Because they have spatial parts and are different things.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c14_15']	猶如現見有瓶衣等物、東西北等，方分別故，斯皆現有支分可得。	猶如現見有瓶衣等物、東西北等，方分別故，斯皆現有支分可得。	001	Just like the presently seen things such as vases and clothing, because of the distinctions of east, west, north, etc., all of them are presently obtained with parts.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c15_14']	若言極微是現有者，必有方分，別異性故。	若言極微是現有者，必有方分，別異性故。	001	If you say that the ultimate atom is a present existent, it must have spatial extension, because it has a different nature.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c16_7']	是則應許東西北等支分別故。	是則應許東西北等支分別故。	001	Then you must admit that it is divided into east, west, north, etc.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c17_2']	此實極微理不成就，亦非一體。	此實極微理不成就，亦非一體。	001	This ultimate atom is not logically established, nor is it a single entity.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c17_12']	多分成故、見事別故。	多分成故、見事別故。	001	Because it is composed of many parts and because we see different things.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c18_10']	一實極微定不可得，如是應捨極微之論。	一實極微定不可得，如是應捨極微之論。	001	A truly ultimate atom can never be found. Thus you should abandon the theory of the ultimate atom.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c19_13']	是故智者了知三界咸是妄情，欲求妙理不應執實。	是故智者了知三界咸是妄情，欲求妙理不應執實。	001	Therefore the wise know that the three realms are all false emotions. If you wish to seek the wondrous truth, you should not cling to reality.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c19_16']	頌曰：	頌曰：	001	Verse:
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c20_0']	妄有非實故，　　與所見不同，	妄有非實故，　　與所見不同，	001	False existence is not real, therefore it is not the same as what is seen.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c21_13']	由境相虛妄，　　能緣亦非有。	由境相虛妄，　　能緣亦非有。	001	Because the characteristics of the objective realm are false, the perceiving mind is also nonexistent.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c25_3']	若言我亦於彼瓶衣等事許彼自性是不可得，皆是妄識之所分別，然而緣彼相狀亂識是其實有，觀健達婆城及幻人等，其識是有。	若言我亦於彼瓶衣等事許彼自性是不可得，皆是妄識之所分別，然而緣彼相狀亂識是其實有，觀健達婆城及幻人等，其識是有。	001	If you say that we also admit that the self-nature of those things such as pots and clothes cannot be attained, they are all discriminated by false consciousness, but the confused consciousness that takes them as its object is really existent. Observing the Gandharva city and illusory people, etc., their consciousness exists.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c26_2']	設有此識，亦非實故，與所見事不相應故。	設有此識，亦非實故，與所見事不相應故。	001	Even if this consciousness exists, it is also unreal, and it is not associated with the seen object.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c26_16']	此惑亂識，於所緣境作有性解。	此惑亂識，於所緣境作有性解。	001	This deluded consciousness takes the object as having a real nature.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c28_8']	彼事自性已明非有，境既是無，能緣妄識亦非實有，云何令彼妄識有耶？	彼事自性已明非有，境既是無，能緣妄識亦非實有，云何令彼妄識有耶？	001	The self-nature of that object has already been shown to be nonexistent. Since the object is nonexistent, the deluded consciousness that grasps it also does not really exist. How can you make that deluded consciousness exist?
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0884c29_9']	然於世間不曾見有無能生種子有所生芽等？	然於世間不曾見有無能生種子有所生芽等？	001	Moreover, in the world, we have never seen a nonexistent seed give rise to a sprout, etc.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a01_4']	由斯汝說幻城等喻道理不成。	由斯汝說幻城等喻道理不成。	001	Therefore, your argument that the analogy of a phantom city, etc. is not established is unreasonable.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a02_0']	斯皆是假設，　　善覺者能知，	斯皆是假設，　　善覺者能知，	001	All of these are provisional designations. The one with good understanding can know.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a03_13']	智人斷煩惱，　　易若除蛇怖。	智人斷煩惱，　　易若除蛇怖。	001	The wise person eliminates afflictions easily, like removing the fear of a snake.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a05_10']	如說三界但有假名，瓶等麁覺既除遣已，知從名言而有其事。	如說三界但有假名，瓶等麁覺既除遣已，知從名言而有其事。	001	Just as it is said that the three realms are only provisional names, once the coarse awareness of things like pots has been eliminated, one knows that they exist due to names and expressions.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a06_8']	善觀察者能了知已，即於繩處蛇怖除遣；	善觀察者能了知已，即於繩處蛇怖除遣；	001	The one who observes well is able to understand this, and then eliminates the fear of a snake in the place of the rope;
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a07_7']	復審思惟，了彼差別，於繩等處妄執亦無。	復審思惟，了彼差別，於繩等處妄執亦無。	001	Further contemplate and understand their distinctions, and false grasping also does not exist in ropes and other places.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a09_1']	如是觀時，一切能生離染之法，易速蠲除煩惱羅網，及諸業果自當斷滅。	如是觀時，一切能生離染之法，易速蠲除煩惱羅網，及諸業果自當斷滅。	001	When contemplating in this way, all dharmas that give rise to detachment are easily and quickly removed, and the net of afflictions and the fruits of karma will naturally be severed.

['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a13_3']	猶如世人於諸俗事瓶衣等處，以為實有名瓶衣等；	猶如世人於諸俗事瓶衣等處，以為實有名瓶衣等；	001	Just as worldly people regard things such as vases and clothing as truly existing and having names such as vases and clothing;
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a14_2']	智者亦爾，當順世間而興言說，知非實有。	智者亦爾，當順世間而興言說，知非實有。	001	The wise are also like this. They should follow the world in speaking, knowing that they do not truly exist.
['ZH_T31_1621_001:0885a16_13']	若樂觀察煩惱過失求解脫者，宜於如是真勝義中周遍推尋、如理作意，於諸境處及能緣妄識煩惱繫縛不復生長。	若樂觀察煩惱過失求解脫者，宜於如是真勝義中周遍推尋、如理作意，於諸境處及能緣妄識煩惱繫縛不復生長。	001	If one delights in observing the faults of afflictions and seeks liberation, one should thoroughly investigate the true supreme meaning and contemplate in accordance with principle. The bondage of afflictions will no longer arise and grow in the objects and the deluded consciousness that grasps them.
