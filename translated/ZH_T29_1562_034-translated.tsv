['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534b24_8']	2 二辯業品第四之二於正法內有作是言：	2 二辯業品第四之二於正法內有作是言：	Chapter 4, section 2: In the true teachings, there are those who say:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534b25_4']	身及山等久住不滅，故契經說：	身及山等久住不滅，故契經說：	The body and mountains, etc. remain for a long time without ceasing. Therefore, the sūtras say:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534b25_18']	或有一類身住十年，乃至廣說。	或有一類身住十年，乃至廣說。	There may be a type of person whose body remains for ten years, and so on, speaking in detail.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534b26_16']	又說七日羯剌藍住，又說持地住經一劫。	又說七日羯剌藍住，又說持地住經一劫。	It also says that the kalala remains for seven days, and it also says that the earth remains for one kalpa.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534b27_15']	由此知身可得久住，故有行動為表理成。	由此知身可得久住，故有行動為表理成。	From this, it is known that the body can remain for a long time, so the principle of movement is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534b29_18']	此義不然，且彼亦許諸心心所有剎那滅，由此可證彼所不許，身及山等剎那滅義，應作是言：	此義不然，且彼亦許諸心心所有剎那滅，由此可證彼所不許，身及山等剎那滅義，應作是言：	This meaning is not so. Moreover, they also admit that all minds and mental factors cease in a moment. From this, one can prove that the meaning of the cessation in a moment of the body and mountains, etc. which they do not admit, should be said in this way:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c01_12']	身剎那滅，見隨心等有轉變故。	身剎那滅，見隨心等有轉變故。	The body ceases in a moment, because it is seen that there is transformation according to the mind, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c03_12']	謂見身相於起苦樂貪瞋等時隨心等轉，既隨心等念念滅法身有轉變，故剎那滅義成。	謂見身相於起苦樂貪瞋等時隨心等轉，既隨心等念念滅法身有轉變，故剎那滅義成。	When one sees the body, and when suffering, happiness, craving, hatred, etc. arise, they follow along with the mind, etc. Since they follow along with the mind, etc., which are dharmas that perish moment by moment, the body also changes. Therefore the meaning of perishing in a moment is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c06_1']	又身與心等安危故，謂身既是剎那滅心所執受故，必安危等，以身有識續住多時，識若離身即便爛壞。	又身與心等安危故，謂身既是剎那滅心所執受故，必安危等，以身有識續住多時，識若離身即便爛壞。	Moreover, the body and mind, etc., are the same in terms of safety and danger. The body is that which is grasped by the mind that perishes in a moment, and therefore it must be the same in terms of safety and danger, etc. Because the body continues to exist for a long time when there is consciousness, but if consciousness leaves the body it immediately decays and perishes.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c07_2']	既與剎那滅心等安危故，身應如心必剎那滅。	既與剎那滅心等安危故，身應如心必剎那滅。	Since it is the same in terms of safety and danger as the mind that perishes in a moment, the body should be like the mind and must perish in a moment.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c07_16']	又身如識而宣說故，謂契經言：	又身如識而宣說故，謂契經言：	Moreover, the body is explained to be like consciousness. A scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c09_1']	是心意識，剎那臘縛牟呼栗多別異而生、別異而滅。	是心意識，剎那臘縛牟呼栗多別異而生、別異而滅。	This mind, thought, and consciousness are born separately and perish separately in a moment, a period of sixty thought-moments, or a period of sixty thought-moments and sixteen thought-moments.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c09_6']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Moreover, a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c10_1']	身於彼彼剎那等位衰老枯竭。	身於彼彼剎那等位衰老枯竭。	The body in those various moments, etc., ages and dries up.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c10_6']	又契經言：	又契經言：	Moreover, a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c10_9']	苾芻！	苾芻！	Bhikṣus!
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c11_1']	諸行無有住止，速歸壞滅。	諸行無有住止，速歸壞滅。	All conditioned things do not abide, quickly returning to destruction.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c11_4']	又言：	又言：	It also says:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c11_7']	苾芻！	苾芻！	Bhikṣus!
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c11_22']	諸行如幻，或增或減，暫住即滅。	諸行如幻，或增或減，暫住即滅。	The various activities are like illusions, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing, and immediately ceasing upon abiding for a moment.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c12_4']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Moreover, a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c12_9']	摩納縛迦！	摩納縛迦！	Monavakya!
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c13_8']	從入胎夜乃至衰老，恒速逝往，無住無迴。	從入胎夜乃至衰老，恒速逝往，無住無迴。	From the night of entering the womb until old age and decay, one always goes quickly, without abiding or returning.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c14_7']	由此等經，證知諸行皆剎那滅，無久住理。	由此等經，證知諸行皆剎那滅，無久住理。	Based on these sutras, it is proven that the various activities all cease in a moment, and there is no principle of abiding for a long time.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c15_6']	而言住者，但約諸行相似相續，假說無違。	而言住者，但約諸行相似相續，假說無違。	As for saying that there is abiding, it is only about the similar continuity of the various activities, provisionally speaking without contradiction.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c15_18']	亦有契經說心有住，如言：	亦有契經說心有住，如言：	There are also sutras that say the mind has abiding, such as saying:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c16_5']	心住不可移轉。	心住不可移轉。	The mind abides and cannot be moved.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c16_9']	又經說：	又經說：	Moreover, a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c17_5']	心從初靜慮移入第二靜慮等中。	心從初靜慮移入第二靜慮等中。	The mind moves from the first dhyana and enters the second dhyana, and so on.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c17_8']	又說：	又說：	Moreover, it is said:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c17_15']	心調便能住上。	心調便能住上。	When the mind is disciplined, it can abide in the superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c18_14']	又於苦等生已相續多時住中，假說故受。	又於苦等生已相續多時住中，假說故受。	Moreover, it is provisionally said that feeling arises and continues for many moments in the midst of suffering, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c20_2']	又彼雖許月輪劫住而假說新，非假說中即可決定執為實有。	又彼雖許月輪劫住而假說新，非假說中即可決定執為實有。	Moreover, although they allow that the lunar disk abides for an eon, it is provisionally said to be new, and it cannot be determined to exist substantially in the provisional teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c20_12']	又相有別，體異義成。	又相有別，體異義成。	Moreover, the characteristics have differences, and the meaning of different substances is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c22_2']	非一體中相可有別，現見異體相方別故，如牛有垂𩑶、馬有旋毛等。	非一體中相可有別，現見異體相方別故，如牛有垂𩑶、馬有旋毛等。	The characteristics of a single substance cannot be different, because we actually see that different substances have different characteristics, like a cow having a dewlap and a horse having a flowing mane, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c23_1']	於一相續，相既有殊，由此證知體必有異。	於一相續，相既有殊，由此證知體必有異。	Since the characteristics of a single continuum are different, this proves that the substance must be different.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c24_1']	乳酪顯色雖復相同，俱行別故，必有異體。	乳酪顯色雖復相同，俱行別故，必有異體。	Although the color of milk and curd is the same, they must have different substances, because they have different properties.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c25_1']	謂二顯色甘酢味俱，故體必應前後各別。	謂二顯色甘酢味俱，故體必應前後各別。	That is, the two colors and the sweet and sour tastes occur together, so their substances must be different before and after.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c26_9']	身亦應爾，既前後位相有不同，由此比知舉體界聚前後各別。	身亦應爾，既前後位相有不同，由此比知舉體界聚前後各別。	The body should also be like this. Since the characteristics are different in the past and future states, by analogy we know that the entire substance, realm, and aggregates are different before and after.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c27_1']	故剎那滅，其理極成。	故剎那滅，其理極成。	Therefore the principle of momentary cessation is completely established.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c28_1']	既一切行皆剎那滅，如何業果感赴理成？	既一切行皆剎那滅，如何業果感赴理成？	Since all conditioned forces are momentary and cease, how is the principle of the attraction and response of karmic results established?
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c28_6']	如何不成？	如何不成？	How is it not established?
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c28_11']	不相及故。	不相及故。	Because they do not contact each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0534c29_10']	謂曾未見種體已滅猶能生芽，亦非所許。	謂曾未見種體已滅猶能生芽，亦非所許。	That is, we have never seen the already ceased substance of a seed still able to produce a sprout, nor is this accepted.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a01_8']	然非諸業如種生芽，於正滅時與異熟果；	然非諸業如種生芽，於正滅時與異熟果；	However, karmic forces are not like seeds producing sprouts, and at the time of cessation they do not give rise to results that ripen in a subsequent lifetime.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a02_7']	又非無法可能為因，是故應無業果感赴。	又非無法可能為因，是故應無業果感赴。	Moreover, if dharmas do not exist, they cannot be causes. Therefore, there would be no karmic retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a02_12']	是彼宗過。	是彼宗過。	This is the error of their school.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a02_17']	何謂彼宗？	何謂彼宗？	What is their school?
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a03_2']	謂譬喻宗。	謂譬喻宗。	It is the school of the Vaibhāṣikas.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a03_7']	故彼宗說：	故彼宗說：	Therefore, they say:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a04_5']	如外種果感赴理成，如是應知業果感赴。	如外種果感赴理成，如是應知業果感赴。	Just as the principle of the retribution of external seeds is established, so should one understand the retribution of karmic results.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a07_10']	謂如外種，由遇別緣為親傳因感果已滅，由此後位遂起根芽莖枝葉等諸異相法，體雖不住而相續轉，於最後位復遇別緣方能為因生於自果。	謂如外種，由遇別緣為親傳因感果已滅，由此後位遂起根芽莖枝葉等諸異相法，體雖不住而相續轉，於最後位復遇別緣方能為因生於自果。	It is just as external seeds, encountering special conditions, become the immediate cause for the arising of results. After the results have arisen, the seeds cease. Due to this, in subsequent stages, roots, sprouts, stems, branches, leaves, and so forth arise, with different characteristics. Although their substance does not abide, they continue to transform. In the final stage, they again encounter special conditions and are then able to act as causes, producing their own results.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a10_15']	如是諸業於相續中為親傳因感果已滅，由此於後自相續中，有分位別異相法起，體雖不住而相續轉，於最後位復遇別緣方能為因生於自果。	如是諸業於相續中為親傳因感果已滅，由此於後自相續中，有分位別異相法起，體雖不住而相續轉，於最後位復遇別緣方能為因生於自果。	In the same way, karmic actions in the continuum become the immediate cause for the arising of results. After the results have arisen, the karmic actions cease. Due to this, in the subsequent stages of one's own continuum, there arise dharmas with different characteristics. Although their substance does not abide, they continue to transform. In the final stage, they again encounter special conditions and are then able to act as causes, producing their own results.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a13_7']	雖彼外種非親為因令自果生，然由展轉，如是諸業亦非親為因令自果生，然由展轉力，內外因果相續理同。	雖彼外種非親為因令自果生，然由展轉，如是諸業亦非親為因令自果生，然由展轉力，內外因果相續理同。	Although external seeds are not the direct cause of the production of their own fruits, still, by way of a series, in the same way, actions are not the direct cause of the production of their own fruits, still, by way of a series, the internal and external causes and effects are the same in principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a15_5']	外謂種根芽等，不斷名為相續，內法相續謂前後心恒無間斷，故無外道所難過失。	外謂種根芽等，不斷名為相續，內法相續謂前後心恒無間斷，故無外道所難過失。	The external refers to seeds, roots, sprouts, etc., which are called a series because they are not cut off. The internal dharmas are a series because the mind is always uninterrupted before and after. Therefore, there is no fault in the criticism of the non-Buddhists.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a16_13']	今詳彼釋一切可然，謂若唯言現在有者，可有相續展轉理成。	今詳彼釋一切可然，謂若唯言現在有者，可有相續展轉理成。	We carefully examine their explanations, and all are reasonable. If one only says that the present exists, then the principle of a series and mutual succession can be established.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a17_3']	然理不成，故唯有語。	然理不成，故唯有語。	However, the principle is not established, so there is only talk.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a17_13']	彼不成理，餘處已說。	彼不成理，餘處已說。	The principle of non-establishment has already been explained elsewhere.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a18_11']	設許相續展轉理成，彼不應如種果道理。	設許相續展轉理成，彼不應如種果道理。	Even if we allow that the principle of a series and mutual succession is established, it should not be like the principle of seeds and fruits.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a19_9']	現見種等，展轉相續必無間絕方能生果；	現見種等，展轉相續必無間絕方能生果；	It is seen that seeds, etc., in a series and mutual succession must be uninterrupted in order to be able to produce fruits;
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a20_1']	心能生果，相續有間。	心能生果，相續有間。	the mind that produces fruits has a series with interruptions.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a21_18']	故種果喻，於彼所宗業果感赴無能證力，以入無想二無心定，心等不行，如前已辯。	故種果喻，於彼所宗業果感赴無能證力，以入無想二無心定，心等不行，如前已辯。	Therefore, the analogy of seeds and fruits has no power to prove the continuity of karmic results in their system, because when one enters the two mindless samādhis, mind and so forth do not function, as has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a23_2']	又說意行此中滅故，非至果生一業相續恒無間斷。	又說意行此中滅故，非至果生一業相續恒無間斷。	Moreover, it is said that mental activity ceases in this state, so the continuity of a single karmic act is not always uninterrupted until the result is produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a24_15']	彼宗唯許思是實業，此即意行增長功能，隨界習氣種子論等，餘處已遮。	彼宗唯許思是實業，此即意行增長功能，隨界習氣種子論等，餘處已遮。	Their school only accepts volition to be a real karmic act, which is the increased function of mental activity, the habitual tendencies of the realms, seeds, and so forth, as has already been refuted elsewhere.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a24_20']	故外難言：	故外難言：	Therefore, an outsider asks:
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a26_3']	無譬喻者所說業果，猶如種果感赴道理，是為正難。	無譬喻者所說業果，猶如種果感赴道理，是為正難。	The continuity of karmic results spoken of by those without analogies is like the principle of seeds and fruits attracting each other. This is a proper objection.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a27_12']	阿毘達磨無心位中說異熟因相續無斷得體實有，先已成立。	阿毘達磨無心位中說異熟因相續無斷得體實有，先已成立。	The Abhidharma says that in the mindless states, the continuity of the causes of karmic maturation is uninterrupted and the substance truly exists, as has already been established.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535a28_2']	即說此得為相續體。	即說此得為相續體。	It is said that this attainment is the substance of the continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b01_1']	若謂得體與業果別，不應說為業相續者，此難非理，一身果故，身與相續是一義故。	若謂得體與業果別，不應說為業相續者，此難非理，一身果故，身與相續是一義故。	If it is said that the substance of attainment is different from the karmic result, it should not be said to be the continuity of karma. This objection is unreasonable, because the body and the result are one, and the body and the continuity are synonymous.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b02_1']	又如業種，業得亦然，故業相續無有間斷。	又如業種，業得亦然，故業相續無有間斷。	Also, the seeds of action and the attainment of action are the same. Therefore the continuity of action is without interruption.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b02_20']	是故我宗業果感赴，同於種果，無理能遮。	是故我宗業果感赴，同於種果，無理能遮。	Therefore, in our school, the correspondence of action and its results is like the correspondence of seeds and their fruits. There is no reason to deny it.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b04_16']	雖諸業得有間斷者，如已滅種，作用雖滅而有少分與果功能，由此後時能與自果。	雖諸業得有間斷者，如已滅種，作用雖滅而有少分與果功能，由此後時能與自果。	Although the attainment of action may be interrupted, like a seed that has already perished, although its activity has ceased, it still has a small amount of power to produce a result. Because of this, later it can produce its own result.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b06_7']	業亦應爾，故對法宗無同彼宗過所隨失，後當成立已滅猶有。	業亦應爾，故對法宗無同彼宗過所隨失，後當成立已滅猶有。	Action should also be like this. Therefore the school of the Abhidharma does not have the fault of following the doctrine that there is a loss of action. Later we will establish that what has perished still exists.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b07_16']	若謂雖爾仍有異作異受果失，不許有一能作受者，體常住故。	若謂雖爾仍有異作異受果失，不許有一能作受者，體常住故。	If you say that even though this is so, there is still the fault of action by one thing and the experience of results by another, because we do not admit that there is a single thing that can act and experience, because its substance is permanent,
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b08_7']	此難不然，異有二故。	此難不然，異有二故。	this objection is not correct, because there are two kinds of difference.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b09_14']	觀理者說異有二種，一者各別相續名異、二一相續體別名異。	觀理者說異有二種，一者各別相續名異、二一相續體別名異。	Those who contemplate principle say that difference is of two kinds: the first is called difference in the case of separate continuities, and the second is called difference in the case of a single continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b10_13']	若別相續所造業因，果必不應餘相續受；	若別相續所造業因，果必不應餘相續受；	If the cause of action is created by a separate continuity, the result must not be experienced by another continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b11_12']	若一相續所造業因，其果何妨此相續受。	若一相續所造業因，其果何妨此相續受。	If the cause of action is created by a single continuum, why should it not experience the results?
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b12_13']	豈如異相續無造受能，則一相續中亦無造受。	豈如異相續無造受能，則一相續中亦無造受。	How can it be like a different continuum, which has no ability to create or experience? Then within a single continuum, there is also no creation or experience.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b15_10']	若謂各別相續名異，與一相續體別名異，異無別故，如彼此無造受義者，亦不應理，因果相屬、不相屬故，猶如稻種望稻麥芽。	若謂各別相續名異，與一相續體別名異，異無別故，如彼此無造受義者，亦不應理，因果相屬、不相屬故，猶如稻種望稻麥芽。	If it is said that different refers to each individual continuum, and different from a single continuum refers to a different substance, because difference has no distinction, like this and that which have no meaning of creation or experience, this is also unreasonable, because cause and effect are related or unrelated, just like rice seeds and rice and wheat sprouts.
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b17_7']	豈由稻種望稻麥芽，二種體異無差別故，即令稻種望稻麥芽，同是相屬或不相屬？	豈由稻種望稻麥芽，二種體異無差別故，即令稻種望稻麥芽，同是相屬或不相屬？	How can it be that because rice seeds and rice and wheat sprouts are different in substance, without distinction, it is said that rice seeds and rice and wheat sprouts are the same in being related or unrelated?
['ZH_T29_1562_034:0535b18_16']	雖彼稻種望稻麥芽體異無別，而望稻芽因果相屬，非望麥芽。	雖彼稻種望稻麥芽體異無別，而望稻芽因果相屬，非望麥芽。	Although rice seeds and rice and wheat sprouts are different in substance, without distinction, but in relation to rice sprouts, cause and effect are related, not in relation to wheat sprouts.
