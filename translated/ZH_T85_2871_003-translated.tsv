It is a sutra outside the canon. The Catalogue of Pseudo-Scriptures Revised by the Zhou Dynasty has this sutra, which is probably a different version. According to the Japanese Records of Spiritual Manifestations, there were many who practiced the Fangguang Repentance. As for repentance, it is one of the four acts and five contemplations, and is a good method for curing the three poisons. Now, reading this sutra, with repentance as the main practice, there is nothing more harmful to the meaning.
