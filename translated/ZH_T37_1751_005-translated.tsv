['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c12_15']	然此色相是實報身應同居土，亦名尊特亦名勝應，而特名法身者，為成行人圓妙觀也。	然此色相是實報身應同居土，亦名尊特亦名勝應，而特名法身者，為成行人圓妙觀也。	However, this form and appearance is the reward body that responds to the land of the Shared Teaching, also called the superior and wonderful body, also called the superior response. But it is called the dharma body in order to perfect the practitioner's perfect and wonderful contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c14_6']	良以報應屬修、法身是性，若漸教說，別起報應二修、莊嚴法身一性；	良以報應屬修、法身是性，若漸教說，別起報應二修、莊嚴法身一性；	This is because the reward and response belong to cultivation, while the dharma body is the nature. If the gradual teaching speaks of it, it separately gives rise to the two cultivations of reward and response, which adorn the one nature of the dharma body;
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c16_12', 'ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c16_14']	若頓教詮，報應二修全是性具、法身一性舉體起修，故得全性成修、全修在性，三身融妙、指一即三。🔽問：	若頓教詮，報應二修全是性具、法身一性舉體起修，故得全性成修、全修在性，三身融妙、指一即三。🔽問：	if the sudden teaching interprets it, the two cultivations of reward and response are entirely endowed with the nature, and the one nature of the dharma body raises the entire body to cultivate. Therefore, the entire nature becomes cultivation, and the entire cultivation is in the nature. The three bodies are fused and wonderful, and pointing to one is the three.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c17_17']	既言指一即三，但名為應自攝二身，何故疏文立法身稱？	既言指一即三，但名為應自攝二身，何故疏文立法身稱？	Since it is said that pointing to one is the three, it is only called the response body and should include the other two bodies. Why does the commentary use the term Dharma body?

['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c18_13']	若言報應，恐濫別修歸於別教。	若言報應，恐濫別修歸於別教。	If it is said to be the reward and response bodies, it may be confused with the separate cultivation and return to the separate teaching.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c19_12']	今以報應名為法身，即顯三身皆非修得。	今以報應名為法身，即顯三身皆非修得。	Now, calling the reward and response bodies the Dharma body, it is shown that the three bodies are all not attained through cultivation.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c20_16']	故今家生身、應身、報身、法身，對藏、通、別、圓。	故今家生身、應身、報身、法身，對藏、通、別、圓。	Therefore, the present family's born body, response body, reward body, and Dharma body, correspond to the Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, and Perfect teachings.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c22_17']	行者應知，圓宗大體非唯報應稱為法身，亦乃業惑名為理毒，三觀十乘名性德行，慈悲與拔性德苦樂。	行者應知，圓宗大體非唯報應稱為法身，亦乃業惑名為理毒，三觀十乘名性德行，慈悲與拔性德苦樂。	Practitioners should know that the great essence of the Perfect Teaching is not only calling the reward and response bodies the Dharma body, but also calling karma and delusion the poison of principle, the three contemplations and ten approaches the practice of inherent virtues, and compassion and deliverance the inherent suffering and joy of virtues.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c24_6']	今之勝應稱為法身，顯示妙宗其旨非淺，須袪滯想方見旨歸。	今之勝應稱為法身，顯示妙宗其旨非淺，須袪滯想方見旨歸。	The present excellent response is called the Dharma body, revealing the wonderful essence whose purport is not shallow. One must dispel stagnant thoughts in order to see the return to the ultimate.

['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c26_15']	既為妙境，但是法身行人心觀。	既為妙境，但是法身行人心觀。	Since it is the wondrous realm, it is only the Dharma body, the mind's contemplation of the practitioner.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c27_11']	即空假中，空假是二修，中觀是一性。	即空假中，空假是二修，中觀是一性。	It is emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way. Emptiness and provisional existence are the two cultivations, and the middle contemplation is the one nature.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0221c29_8']	修性冥妙三觀圓融既為能觀，但是般若境觀相契見尊特身，雖具三身但名解脫。	修性冥妙三觀圓融既為能觀，但是般若境觀相契見尊特身，雖具三身但名解脫。	Cultivation and nature are mysteriously wondrous. The three contemplations are perfectly integrated. Since it is the contemplation, it is only prajñā. The realm and contemplation are in accord. One sees the majestic body. Although it is endowed with the three bodies, it is only called liberation.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222a03_8']	此則以三照三故發現三，合此三三只是一三，三不定三同在一念，一念無念三三宛然，如此方名修心妙觀，此觀能令四土皆淨。	此則以三照三故發現三，合此三三只是一三，三不定三同在一念，一念無念三三宛然，如此方名修心妙觀，此觀能令四土皆淨。	This then uses the three to illuminate the three, thus revealing the three. Combining these three threes is just one three. The three are not fixed as three, but are in one thought. In one thought without thought, the three threes are distinct. Such contemplation is then called the wondrous contemplation of cultivating the mind. This contemplation can make the four lands all pure.

Destroying means that the three delusions and three wisdoms are all exhausted, and establishing means that the three truths and three contemplations are all accomplished.

This is because the hindrances manifest as virtues, thus forming this number.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222a21_16']	佛居凡地具於八萬四千塵勞，於此塵勞皆見實相。	佛居凡地具於八萬四千塵勞，於此塵勞皆見實相。	When the Buddha was an ordinary person, he possessed eighty-four thousand afflictions. In these afflictions, he saw the true reality of all dharmas.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222a23_1']	理智既合，故能示現相好光明，故節節云八萬四千。	理智既合，故能示現相好光明，故節節云八萬四千。	Since principle and wisdom are united, one is able to manifest the marks, excellent features, and radiance. Therefore, it is said eighty-four thousand at each section.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222a23_19']	行人今觀知心即是，能於塵勞皆即佛相。	行人今觀知心即是，能於塵勞皆即佛相。	The practitioner now contemplates and knows that the mind is precisely that, and is able to regard all afflictions as precisely the Buddha's marks.

Therefore, contemplating one Buddha is able to see all Buddhas.

['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222a29_17']	疏有二釋：	疏有二釋：	The commentary has two explanations:
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b01_16']	初、約如來由大悲心起勝應身，故令行者觀身見心。	初、約如來由大悲心起勝應身，故令行者觀身見心。	First, based on the Tathāgata's arising of the superior responsive body due to the mind of great compassion, he causes practitioners to contemplate the mind of seeing the body.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b02_16']	「由見身」下，二、約行者觀想明故得見佛。	「由見身」下，二、約行者觀想明故得見佛。	Due to seeing the body and below, second, based on the practitioner's contemplation and visualization, it is explained that one can see the Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b03_6']	心所以明者，由觀佛身。	心所以明者，由觀佛身。	The reason the mind is clarified is because of contemplating the Buddha's body.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b04_8']	是故二意皆是由色而見於心，以心無形由色表故。	是故二意皆是由色而見於心，以心無形由色表故。	Therefore, the two meanings are both based on form to see the mind, because the mind has no form and is manifested by form.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b05_11']	以圓人所觀色心不二，既見微妙色，豈隔大悲心？	以圓人所觀色心不二，既見微妙色，豈隔大悲心？	Because the form and mind contemplated by the perfect teaching are non-dual, since one sees subtle form, how can one be separated from the mind of great compassion?
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b06_9']	故《勝鬘》云「如來色無盡，智慧亦復然」。	故《勝鬘》云「如來色無盡，智慧亦復然」。	Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says: The Tathāgata's form is inexhaustible, and his wisdom is also so.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b08_5']	既三種慈體是三諦，今三觀明故三慈顯，以用果法為觀行故，故於位位見佛色心。	既三種慈體是三諦，今三觀明故三慈顯，以用果法為觀行故，故於位位見佛色心。	Since the essence of the three kinds of kindness is the three truths, now that the three contemplations are clear, the three kinds of kindness are manifested. Because the Dharma of fruition is used as contemplation and practice, therefore in each stage one sees the Buddha's form and mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b08_18']	二、「佛心」下，正示心體。	二、「佛心」下，正示心體。	Second, the Buddha's mind and below correctly shows the essence of the mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b09_4']	若匪無緣，慈悲不大。	若匪無緣，慈悲不大。	If it is not without conditions, kindness and compassion are not great.

['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b11_16']	經文但云「以無緣慈攝諸眾生」，疏中何故兼明生法皆云無心？	經文但云「以無緣慈攝諸眾生」，疏中何故兼明生法皆云無心？	The sutra text only says with no-object compassion to embrace all beings, why does the commentary also clarify that both beings and dharmas are said to be without mind?
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b11_18']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b12_11']	起三慈者，由三觀智照三諦也。	起三慈者，由三觀智照三諦也。	The one who gives rise to the three kinds of compassion does so by means of the three contemplations and wisdom illuminating the three truths.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b13_19']	照真即起法緣之慈，照俗即起眾生緣慈，照中即起無緣之慈。	照真即起法緣之慈，照俗即起眾生緣慈，照中即起無緣之慈。	Illuminating the true illuminates the compassion of dharmas, illuminating the conventional illuminates the compassion of beings, illuminating the middle illuminates the compassion of no-object.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b16_3']	此三諦慈，淺不具深、深必具淺，故照真俗未必照中，若能照中必具真俗，故次第生法不即無緣。	此三諦慈，淺不具深、深必具淺，故照真俗未必照中，若能照中必具真俗，故次第生法不即無緣。	These three truths of compassion, the shallow does not include the deep, the deep necessarily includes the shallow, therefore illuminating the true and conventional does not necessarily illuminate the middle, if one is able to illuminate the middle one necessarily includes the true and conventional, therefore the sequential compassion of dharmas does not immediately include the compassion of no-object.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b17_11']	今無緣慈合具生法，豈但具二亦乃俱深，故今生法皆云無心。	今無緣慈合具生法，豈但具二亦乃俱深，故今生法皆云無心。	Now the compassion of no-object includes both the compassion of beings and dharmas, how could it only include two, it is also profoundly inclusive, therefore the compassion of beings and dharmas are both said to be without mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b19_5']	故《涅槃》云「慈若有無非有非無，如是之慈非諸聲聞辟支佛等所能思議」。	故《涅槃》云「慈若有無非有非無，如是之慈非諸聲聞辟支佛等所能思議」。	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, If compassion is existent, it is not existent; if it is nonexistent, it is not nonexistent. Such compassion cannot be conceived by the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and others.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b20_11']	當知三慈其體本一，非三非一而三而一，如是方名佛心慈也。	當知三慈其體本一，非三非一而三而一，如是方名佛心慈也。	One should know that the essence of the three kinds of compassion is originally one, neither three nor one yet three and one. Such is called the compassion of the Buddha's mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b20_16']	此自分三：	此自分三：	This is divided into three parts:
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b21_6']	初、眾生緣慈三無差別。	初、眾生緣慈三無差別。	First, the three kinds of distinctions in the compassion of sentient beings.
['ZH_T37_1751_005:0222b25_9']	今盡現前心與眾生，能所既絕無我心想，緣他眾生而一切眾生與我同體，十界因果不離一心，而此一心是慈體故，十界苦集四種道滅，能於一時任運與拔，故云無心攀緣自然現益。	今盡現前心與眾生，能所既絕無我心想，緣他眾生而一切眾生與我同體，十界因果不離一心，而此一心是慈體故，十界苦集四種道滅，能於一時任運與拔，故云無心攀緣自然現益。	Now, the present mind and sentient beings are all present. Since the subject and object are both cut off, there is no thought of self. Although one has compassion for other sentient beings, all sentient beings are the same essence as oneself. The causes and effects of the ten realms are not apart from the one mind. Since this one mind is the essence of compassion, one can effortlessly save the four kinds of suffering and accumulation of the ten realms and the four kinds of paths and cessations at the same time.

The meaning of the treatise lies in seeing that the birth body comes from the outside and has limited form, while the reward body is free from limited characteristics and manifests through the transforming consciousness. Thus, the two bodies are distinguished.

Therefore, the Buddha's body, karma, and conditions are born and then eternally extinguished.

Like in the Vimalakīrti Sutra, the land of various fragrances is only for Bodhisattvas, so it only manifests a tall and great body.

They would rashly criticize the Buddha for having a limited teaching, so he entrusted Wonderful Sound to guide those who had not yet reached understanding, intending to make them realize the superiority within the inferior and the secret and wonderful skillful means.

The Larger Sūtra on Amitāyus says Amitābha's bathing pond is 40,800 li wide. Based on this, his body is not extremely large.

This sutra says that those who are accustomed to the lesser vehicle, when born there, will immediately see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and attain the lesser fruits. There will be bodies of eight feet and six feet.

After being born there for seven days, seeing the Buddha's many marks, the mind is not clear. After twenty-one days, one will clearly see and hear the many sounds all expounding the wonderful Dharma.

The reason for this is that although these people may attain rebirth through turning toward the Buddha at the end of their lives, the Buddha follows their original habits and therefore uses the small vehicle to enable them to realize the fruit.

It is not something that can be seen by ordinary beings or those with small-minded dhyāna meditation who have not accomplished the three contemplations of the fifth grade.

This is then called the samādhi of mindfulness of the Buddha, and one will then be inspired by the Buddhas to appear before and give predictions. Being born there, one will then realize the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.

Relying on this to cultivate contemplation, when the contemplation is accomplished and the principle is revealed, one sees the characteristics as numerous as dust motes in the ocean of the repository, which is then called the majestic and sublime body.

Since the response has a basis, the birth is the same as the Dharma. Therefore, it receives the name of the Dharma body. Therefore, seeing the Buddha's appearance, whether much or little, is all called the Dharma body.
