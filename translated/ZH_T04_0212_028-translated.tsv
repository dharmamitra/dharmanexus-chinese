Like those who practice, they always contemplate and discuss the mind, saying that the mind attracts many calamities and causes people to enter the paths of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals. Therefore, it is said, light and difficult to guard.

Investigating the origin of desire, it lies in the mind and thoughts. It is like thieves relying on dangers to rob. If there were no dangers, there would be no way for troubles to arise.

With subduing, there is peace. People can subdue their minds and not record their lifespan. Wherever they go, they are respected by others. After death, their defilements are exhausted, their minds are liberated, and they attain complete nirvana. Therefore, it is said, Subduing the mind is good. With subduing, there is peace.

When the sunlight first appears, it illuminates the four directions, reaching everywhere. The mind is also like this, rushing towards forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects, unable to control itself and prevent it from flowing and running. It is like a vicious elephant that is difficult to tame. Only when it is restrained by a hook can it be controlled. Therefore, it is said, The mind runs to many places, just like the light of the sun. Only the wise can control it, like a hook stopping a vicious elephant.
