['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895a23_15']	聖教既云唯心．心所名有所依。	聖教既云唯心．心所名有所依。	Since the holy teachings say that only mind and mental factors are called the basis,
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895a24_5']	即應心所亦所依攝。	即應心所亦所依攝。	then mental factors should also be included in the basis.

['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b01_5']	由前引教說心．心所名有所依。	由前引教說心．心所名有所依。	Because the previous scriptures say that mind and mental factors are called the supported,
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b02_1']	即恐心所亦是所依故次簡之。	即恐心所亦是所依故次簡之。	there is a fear that mental factors are also the support, so they are next distinguished.

['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b14_8']	親依轉六亦轉。	親依轉六亦轉。	The seventh is the basis, therefore the sixth also turns.
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b14_13', 'ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b14_18']	八依於七。🔽七非親故。	八依於七。 七非親故。	The eighth relies on the seventh.
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b15_5']	七無漏八不轉。	七無漏八不轉。	The seventh is not the basis, therefore the seventh is pure, the eighth does not turn.
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b16_11']	有執．無執行有相似．不相似故名親．不親　答第二云。	有執．無執行有相似．不相似故名親．不親　答第二云。	There is grasping and no grasping, there is similarity and dissimilarity, therefore it is called basis and not basis. The second answer says:
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b17_1']	若由八轉七方轉。	若由八轉七方轉。	If by the eighth turning the seventh turns,
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b17_9']	可難七轉八亦轉。	可難七轉八亦轉。	then it can be criticized that when the seventh turns the eighth also turns.
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b17_18']	第八轉位七先轉故。	第八轉位七先轉故。	Because when the eighth turns the seventh has already turned.
['ZH_T43_1833_04a:0895b18_5']	七轉時八不轉。	七轉時八不轉。	When the seventh turns the eighth does not turn.
