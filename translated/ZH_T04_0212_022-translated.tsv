['ZH_T04_0212_022:0724c26_16']	雖誦千章，不義何益者，夫人在世多誦廣學，不曉義理亦復不了味義句義，猶如有人多負草木至百千擔，正可勞苦無益時用。	雖誦千章，不義何益者，夫人在世多誦廣學，不曉義理亦復不了味義句義，猶如有人多負草木至百千擔，正可勞苦無益時用。	Though one may recite a thousand words without meaning, what benefit is there? This is because when people are in the world, they often recite and learn widely, but do not understand principles or meanings, and also do not comprehend the meaning of flavors and phrases, just like a person who carries hundreds of thousands of bundles of grass and wood, which can only be laborious and useless for the time being.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0724c27_13']	是故說曰，雖誦千章，不義何益也。	是故說曰，雖誦千章，不義何益也。	Therefore it is said, Though one may recite a thousand words without meaning, what benefit is there?
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a03_11']	寧解一句，聞可得道者，如昔有士，多貯財貨饒諸穀食，意欲遠遊，便以家穀糶之易寶，積珍無量，後復以珍寶多易好銀，意復嫌多，便以好銀轉博紫磨金，意復嫌多，時以好金轉無價如意摩尼寶，所願畢果終不差違。	寧解一句，聞可得道者，如昔有士，多貯財貨饒諸穀食，意欲遠遊，便以家穀糶之易寶，積珍無量，後復以珍寶多易好銀，意復嫌多，便以好銀轉博紫磨金，意復嫌多，時以好金轉無價如意摩尼寶，所願畢果終不差違。	It is better to understand a single sentence, hearing which one can attain the Way. As in the past there was a person who stored much wealth and had plenty of grain and food. Wishing to travel far, he sold his family's grain to obtain treasures, accumulating countless precious things. Later, he again used many treasures to exchange for fine silver, but then found it too much, so he used the fine silver to trade for purple gold, but again found it too much. At that time, he used the fine gold to exchange for priceless wish-fulfilling maṇi jewels, and all his wishes were fulfilled without fail.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a04_16']	此亦如是，雖多學問，不解句義，解一義者，所獲必剋。	此亦如是，雖多學問，不解句義，解一義者，所獲必剋。	This is also like that. Although one may study much, if one does not understand the meaning of the sentences, understanding a single meaning will surely bring about attainment.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a05_10']	是故說曰，寧解一句，聞可得道也。	是故說曰，寧解一句，聞可得道也。	Therefore it is said, It is better to understand a single sentence, hearing which one can attain the Way.

['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a10_14']	雖誦千章，法義具足者，人多修學義味成就，然復不能思惟義趣，便自墜落不至究竟，是故說曰，雖誦千章，法義具足也。	雖誦千章，法義具足者，人多修學義味成就，然復不能思惟義趣，便自墜落不至究竟，是故說曰，雖誦千章，法義具足也。	Although one recites a thousand phrases with the complete meaning of the Dharma, many people study and accomplish the meaning, but if they are unable to contemplate the meaning, they will fall by themselves and not reach the ultimate. Therefore, it is said: Although one recites a thousand phrases with the complete meaning of the Dharma.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a13_18']	聞一法句，可從滅意者，世多有人博學多聞，能思一句至百千義，義義相次不失其緒，以漸得至無為大道，是故說曰，聞一法句，可從滅意也。	聞一法句，可從滅意者，世多有人博學多聞，能思一句至百千義，義義相次不失其緒，以漸得至無為大道，是故說曰，聞一法句，可從滅意也。	Hearing a single phrase of the Dharma, one can follow it to extinguish the mind. In the world, there are many people who are well-versed and knowledgeable, able to contemplate a single phrase up to a hundred thousand meanings, with each meaning following the next without losing the thread, gradually reaching the great path of the unconditioned. Therefore, it is said: Hearing a single phrase of the Dharma, one can follow it to extinguish the mind.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a15_2']	雖復壽百年，毀戒意不定，不如一日中，供養持戒人。	雖復壽百年，毀戒意不定，不如一日中，供養持戒人。	Even if one lives a hundred years, with precepts violated and an unsettled mind, it is not as good as a single day of making offerings to those who uphold the precepts.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a19_19']	雖復壽百年，毀戒意不定者，夫犯戒之人不護三事，坐禪誦經佐助，如斯之類不可親近，雖久在世積惡無量，死入地獄受無數苦，火車爐炭刀山劍樹，畜生餓鬼亦復如是，是故說曰，雖復壽百年，毀戒意不定也。	雖復壽百年，毀戒意不定者，夫犯戒之人不護三事，坐禪誦經佐助，如斯之類不可親近，雖久在世積惡無量，死入地獄受無數苦，火車爐炭刀山劍樹，畜生餓鬼亦復如是，是故說曰，雖復壽百年，毀戒意不定也。	Although one may live a hundred years, if one's precepts are broken and one's mind is unstable, one who violates the precepts does not protect the three matters, sitting in meditation, reciting the sutras, and assisting. Such a person should not be associated with. Although one may stay in the world for a long time accumulating evil, after death one enters hell and receives countless sufferings, such as fire carts, furnaces, charcoal, knife mountains, and sword trees. The same is true for animals and hungry ghosts. Therefore, it is said: Although one may live a hundred years, if one's precepts are broken and one's mind is unstable.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725a23_14']	不如一日中，供養持戒人者，持戒之人修行定意，一日功德無數無量，不可以譬喻為比，久處於世積德無量，若生於天自然受福，是故說曰，不如一日中，供養持戒人。	不如一日中，供養持戒人者，持戒之人修行定意，一日功德無數無量，不可以譬喻為比，久處於世積德無量，若生於天自然受福，是故說曰，不如一日中，供養持戒人。	It is not as good as one day of making offerings to a person who upholds the precepts. A person who upholds the precepts practices concentration and wisdom. The merit of one day is countless and immeasurable, and cannot be compared with analogies. If one stays in the world for a long time accumulating immeasurable virtue, if one is reborn in the heavens one naturally receives blessings. Therefore, it is said: It is not as good as one day of making offerings to a person who upholds the precepts.

['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725b01_1']	人之無智其譬亦爾，愚闇纏裹莫知其明，是故說曰，雖壽百年，無慧不定也。	人之無智其譬亦爾，愚闇纏裹莫知其明，是故說曰，雖壽百年，無慧不定也。	A person without wisdom is also like this. Wrapped in foolishness and darkness, they do not know what is bright. Therefore, it is said: Although one may live a hundred years without wisdom or certainty.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725b03_15']	不如一日，𭶑慧有定者，𭶑慧之人深入法典，從一句義至百千義，思惟反覆不以為難，是故說曰，不如一日，𭶑慧有定也。	不如一日，𭶑慧有定者，𭶑慧之人深入法典，從一句義至百千義，思惟反覆不以為難，是故說曰，不如一日，𭶑慧有定也。	It is not as good as one day of wisdom and certainty. A wise person deeply enters the scriptures. From one meaning to a hundred thousand meanings, contemplating and turning over is not difficult. Therefore, it is said: It is not as good as one day of wisdom and certainty.

['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725b09_14']	雖復壽百年，懈怠不精進者，如世有人意恒懈怠所願不成，既自墜落復使他人沒在生死，自陷溺者失五分法身，不至無為大道之處，自迷於道轉教他人沒在生死；	雖復壽百年，懈怠不精進者，如世有人意恒懈怠所願不成，既自墜落復使他人沒在生死，自陷溺者失五分法身，不至無為大道之處，自迷於道轉教他人沒在生死；	Even if one lives a hundred years, if one is lazy and not diligent, it is like a person in the world who is always lazy and does not accomplish their wishes. Having fallen themselves, they cause others to be submerged in birth and death. Those who are self-deluded lose the five parts of the Dharma body and do not reach the place of the great path of no-action. They themselves are confused about the path and teach others to be submerged in birth and death.
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725b12_7']	若受檀越飯食床臥具病瘦醫藥，不能消化，從生至死墮于地獄餓鬼畜生，雖得為人，邊地佛後世智辯聰八難之處。	若受檀越飯食床臥具病瘦醫藥，不能消化，從生至死墮于地獄餓鬼畜生，雖得為人，邊地佛後世智辯聰八難之處。	If one accepts the food, bedding, bedding, and medicine of donors, but cannot digest them, from birth to death one will fall into hell, hungry ghosts, or animals. Even if one becomes a human, one will be in a borderland, after the Buddha's time, with worldly wisdom and eloquence, and in one of the eight difficult circumstances.

Some people in the world are vigorously diligent and understand that the world is impermanent, that a human body is difficult to obtain, that encountering a Buddha's world is difficult, that being born in a central country is also difficult to encounter, and that having complete faculties is also difficult to obtain;
['ZH_T04_0212_022:0725b17_18']	於賢聖法中求作沙門亦不可得，聞真法言復不可得。	於賢聖法中求作沙門亦不可得，聞真法言復不可得。	In the teachings of the sages, it is also unobtainable to seek to become a monk, and it is also unobtainable to hear the true Dharma.

It is also not difficult to attain nirvana. Having already accomplished it, one can then perfect the uncontaminated Dharma body.

Even if one accumulates immeasurable offenses in a hundred years, one still does not know about the arising and ceasing of things. Although one may leave the household life and practice the Way, if one does not understand arising and ceasing within the teachings of the Tathāgata, one will always remain at the stage of an ordinary person and not reach the unconditioned. This is not the duty of a bhikṣu or śramaṇa, and one is far from the treasure-store of the Tathāgata and not close to the Buddha's teachings. Therefore it is said: Although one may live a hundred years, if one does not know about the arising and ceasing of things.

When a person is in the world, observing and penetrating all dharmas, one by one empty, the born do not know why they are born, the extinguished do not know why they are extinguished, being able to know the fundamental by distinguishing them one by one, even on the day of death, one is not afraid or fearful, and has nothing to be afraid of, the spirit and consciousness are not confused in the place where one is born, encountering sages and hearing the Dharma to attain liberation. Therefore, it is said, It is not as good as being born for one day and understanding the matter of birth and death.

When a person is in the world, not knowing the origin of the extinction of pain, although being a bhikṣu, not penetrating the practice of a śramaṇa. Therefore, it is said, Observe the origin of pain.
