['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699a21_13']	一以苦自要，增悲念故。	一以苦自要，增悲念故。	First, taking suffering upon oneself increases compassionate thoughts.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699a22_3']	《瑜伽》四十九「問云：	《瑜伽》四十九「問云：	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, fascicle forty-nine, asks:
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699a23_11']	菩薩從勝解行地隨入淨勝意樂地時，云何超過諸惡趣」等。	菩薩從勝解行地隨入淨勝意樂地時，云何超過諸惡趣」等。	When bodhisattvas from the ground of practicing with devoted interest enter the ground of pure superior intention, how do they transcend the evil destinies? and so on.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699a24_11']	此問菩薩云何自離惡趣，下答文廣，意云：	此問菩薩云何自離惡趣，下答文廣，意云：	This question asks how bodhisattvas themselves leave the evil destinies. The answer below is extensive. The meaning is:
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699a26_6']	謂菩薩於世間清淨靜慮已善積資糧，於多苦有情修習哀愍，無餘思惟。	謂菩薩於世間清淨靜慮已善積資糧，於多苦有情修習哀愍，無餘思惟。	That is to say, the bodhisattva, having already well accumulated the requisites in the mundane pure meditative absorptions, cultivates compassion for sentient beings with much suffering, without any other thought.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b01_5']	由此修習故，得哀愍意樂及悲意樂，為利惡趣有情誓處惡趣如己舍宅，設住惡趣能證菩提亦能忍受，為除物苦願身代受，令彼惡業永不現行，一切善業常得現行。	由此修習故，得哀愍意樂及悲意樂，為利惡趣有情誓處惡趣如己舍宅，設住惡趣能證菩提亦能忍受，為除物苦願身代受，令彼惡業永不現行，一切善業常得現行。	By cultivating this, he attains the resolve of compassion and the resolve of pity, and vows to dwell in the evil destinies as if in his own house for the sake of benefiting sentient beings in the evil destinies. Even if dwelling in the evil destinies, he is able to realize enlightenment and is also able to endure it. He vows to take on the suffering of others in his own body in order to eliminate it, causing their evil karma to never manifest again, and enabling them to always manifest all wholesome karma.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b03_3']	由此悲願力故，一切惡趣諸煩惱品所有麁重，於自所依皆得除遣，得入初地。	由此悲願力故，一切惡趣諸煩惱品所有麁重，於自所依皆得除遣，得入初地。	By the power of this compassionate vow, all the coarseness belonging to the class of afflictions in all the evil destinies is eliminated from his own basis, and he attains entry into the first ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b03_6']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b04_11']	約此但有悲願意樂，身不能代，由悲決定自獲勝益。	約此但有悲願意樂，身不能代，由悲決定自獲勝益。	In this case, there is only the resolve of compassion, and the body cannot take on the suffering of others. Due to compassion, one definitely attains supreme benefit for oneself.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b06_6']	二約菩薩本為利生求法苦行已名為代，後能為物為增上緣亦名代受。	二約菩薩本為利生求法苦行已名為代，後能為物為增上緣亦名代受。	Second, in terms of the bodhisattva's previous suffering and hardship in seeking the Dharma for the sake of benefiting beings, it is already called taking on the suffering of others. Later, being able to act as a dominant condition for others is also called taking on the suffering of others.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b08_3']	三約菩薩留惑同事受有苦身，為生說法令不造苦因，因亡果喪亦名代受。	三約菩薩留惑同事受有苦身，為生說法令不造苦因，因亡果喪亦名代受。	Third, in terms of bodhisattvas remaining in the stage of afflictions and engaging in activities, they take on bodies subject to suffering, in order to expound the Dharma for sentient beings and cause them not to create the causes of suffering. When the causes are eliminated, the effects are also eliminated, which is also called taking on suffering on behalf of others.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b10_13']	四設有眾生欲造無間等業，菩薩化止不從遂斷其命，菩薩自受惡趣苦報，令彼得免無間大苦，名為代受。	四設有眾生欲造無間等業，菩薩化止不從遂斷其命，菩薩自受惡趣苦報，令彼得免無間大苦，名為代受。	Fourth, suppose there are sentient beings who wish to create the karma of the five heinous crimes, etc. The bodhisattvas transform and stop them, but they do not comply and end up killing them. The bodhisattvas themselves receive the suffering retributions of the evil destinies, causing them to avoid the great suffering of the five heinous crimes, which is called taking on suffering on behalf of others.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b12_5']	此依梁《攝論》第十一說，《涅槃》仙預國王亦同此義，非唯意樂而已。	此依梁《攝論》第十一說，《涅槃》仙預國王亦同此義，非唯意樂而已。	This is based on the eleventh chapter of the Liang Dynasty's *Mahāyānasaṃgrahopanibandhana. The Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra's Xianyu Kingdom King is also the same meaning, not just the intention.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b15_9']	五由菩薩初修正願為生受苦，至究竟位願成自在，常在惡趣救代眾生，如地藏菩薩及現莊嚴王等，乃至饑世身為大魚，皆其類也。	五由菩薩初修正願為生受苦，至究竟位願成自在，常在惡趣救代眾生，如地藏菩薩及現莊嚴王等，乃至饑世身為大魚，皆其類也。	Fifth, due to the bodhisattvas initially cultivating the correct vows to receive suffering for sentient beings, when they reach the ultimate stage, the vows become freely accomplished, and they always remain in the evil destinies to save and replace sentient beings, like the Bodhisattva Earth Treasury and the present King of Adornments, etc., even in times of famine becoming a great fish, all of which are of this type.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b16_9']	或以光明照觸、或神力冥加，其事非一。	或以光明照觸、或神力冥加，其事非一。	Either by illuminating and touching with light, or by secretly adding spiritual power, the matters are not one.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b18_14']	六由菩薩此願契同真如，彼眾生苦即同如性，以同如之願還潛至即真之苦，依此融通亦名代也。	六由菩薩此願契同真如，彼眾生苦即同如性，以同如之願還潛至即真之苦，依此融通亦名代也。	Sixth, by the bodhisattva's vow being in accord with suchness, the suffering of those beings is the same as the nature of suchness. With the vow of the same suchness, one returns to the suffering of suchness. Relying on this fusion, it is also called substitution.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b20_12']	七由普賢以法界為身，一切眾生皆是法界，即眾生受苦常是菩薩，故名為代。	七由普賢以法界為身，一切眾生皆是法界，即眾生受苦常是菩薩，故名為代。	Seventh, by Samantabhadra taking the Dharma realm as his body, all sentient beings are the Dharma realm, and the constant suffering of those beings is always that of the bodhisattva, therefore it is called substitution.
['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b22_10']	上來七義，初但意樂，次二但約為增上緣，四五二義實能身代，六七二義理觀融通。	上來七義，初但意樂，次二但約為增上緣，四五二義實能身代，六七二義理觀融通。	The above seven meanings, the first is only the intention, the next two are only about being the dominant condition, the last four meanings are truly able to substitute with the body, and the last two meanings are the fusion of principle and contemplation.

['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b23_13']	若依四五二義應能普代，何故猶有眾生受苦？	若依四五二義應能普代，何故猶有眾生受苦？	If one relies on the last four meanings, one should be able to universally substitute. Why are there still sentient beings who suffer?

['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b25_13']	二業有定不定故，不定者可代；	二業有定不定故，不定者可代；	Second, karma has the determined and the undetermined. The undetermined can be substituted.

['ZH_T35_1735_026:0699b28_1']	如父母教子、付嚴師令治，如是密益非凡小所知。	如父母教子、付嚴師令治，如是密益非凡小所知。	It is like parents teaching their child and entrusting them to a strict teacher for discipline. Such secret benefits are not known to ordinary people.
