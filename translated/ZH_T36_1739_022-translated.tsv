['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868a27_18']	為令自他皆如法界無礙、自在如諸佛故，以是名為等法界無量迴向。	為令自他皆如法界無礙、自在如諸佛故，以是名為等法界無量迴向。	022	In order to cause oneself and others to be like the Dharma realm, unobstructed, and free like the buddhas, this is called the equal and boundless dedication to the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b02_17']	大意令一切發菩提心者一如法界諸德，用自在圓滿、廣大無限、離大小性、不屬一二三百千萬等有限量故，等無限量法、世間出世間、大智大悲喜捨，等法界、眾生界故。	大意令一切發菩提心者一如法界諸德，用自在圓滿、廣大無限、離大小性、不屬一二三百千萬等有限量故，等無限量法、世間出世間、大智大悲喜捨，等法界、眾生界故。	022	The great meaning is to cause all those who give rise to the bodhi mind to be like the virtues of the Dharma realm, using mastery, perfection, vastness, boundlessness, freedom from the natures of large and small, and not belonging to limited quantities such as one, two, three, four, five, ten thousand, etc., thus equal to the boundless Dharma, the mundane and supramundane, great wisdom, great compassion, joy, and equanimity, equal to the Dharma realm and the realm of sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b05_1']	若不如是迴向，設求菩提，但得二乘住寂菩提、菩薩樂生淨土，皆住門外三車，露地白牛不當其分。	若不如是迴向，設求菩提，但得二乘住寂菩提、菩薩樂生淨土，皆住門外三車，露地白牛不當其分。	022	If one does not dedicate in this way, even if one seeks bodhi, one will only attain the bodhi of the two vehicles abiding in quiescence, or bodhisattvas delighting in being born in the Pure Land, all dwelling outside the gate in the three vehicles, the white ox of the open ground does not correspond to their portion.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b07_14']	此十迴向諸三乘皆得出世心者，令達世間生死之性，自性法界令起大悲，與一切眾生皆得，令見眾生性是法界智故。	此十迴向諸三乘皆得出世心者，令達世間生死之性，自性法界令起大悲，與一切眾生皆得，令見眾生性是法界智故。	022	As for these ten grounds of practice and application of skillful means, all those of the three vehicles who have attained the supramundane mind, are caused to penetrate the nature of worldly birth and death, the nature of dharmas, and the realm of reality, to arouse great compassion, and to attain it together with all sentient beings, causing them to see that the nature of sentient beings is the realm of reality and wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b09_1']	得平等悲門，入普光明圓智之宅故，不令久住草庵化城。	得平等悲門，入普光明圓智之宅故，不令久住草庵化城。	022	They attain the gate of impartial compassion and enter the house of universal light and perfect wisdom, thus preventing them from dwelling for a long time in the grass hut of transformation and the city of refuge.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b12_7']	即如維摩居士所說一期法門是令三乘迴向之小分，《法華》露地白牛之乘略陳一分之寶所，總興法界門普光明大智佛果普賢行海是普終畢也。	即如維摩居士所說一期法門是令三乘迴向之小分，《法華》露地白牛之乘略陳一分之寶所，總興法界門普光明大智佛果普賢行海是普終畢也。	022	It is just as the Dharma gate taught by Vimalakīrti for one period of time, which causes the three vehicles to turn toward the small portion of skillful means, and the white ox vehicle of the Lotus Sūtra briefly presents a portion of the treasure house, generally promoting the gate of the Dharma realm and the great wisdom of universal light, the Buddha fruit, and the ocean of practices of Samantabhadra, which is universally completed.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b16_11']	如此當部經中十迴向門，為迴十住、十行中大悲大智法身萬行功德莊嚴，自他滯障、悲敬不真、知見不廣、悲心不普、心不廣大、不稱無限法界，將此迴向均治令等，稱法界無礙無限自在住故。	如此當部經中十迴向門，為迴十住、十行中大悲大智法身萬行功德莊嚴，自他滯障、悲敬不真、知見不廣、悲心不普、心不廣大、不稱無限法界，將此迴向均治令等，稱法界無礙無限自在住故。	022	In this section of the sutra, the ten grounds of practice are for the sake of turning the great compassion, great wisdom, Dharma body, and myriad practices and merits of the ten abodes and ten practices into adornments for oneself and others, to eliminate the obstacles of attachment, to make compassion and respect genuine, to broaden knowledge and views, to make the compassionate mind universal, to make the mind vast and great, and to accord with the unobstructed and limitless Dharma realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b19_9']	若不如是以無限迴向，發願普為無限法界眾生，即自住真門偏生淨土，不依法界無礙、垢淨平等、無限同體大悲不成佛果故。	若不如是以無限迴向，發願普為無限法界眾生，即自住真門偏生淨土，不依法界無礙、垢淨平等、無限同體大悲不成佛果故。	022	If one does not do so with an unlimited dedication, making vows for the sake of the unlimited sentient beings in the Dharma realm, then one will dwell in the true gate and be born in the Pure Land alone, not relying on the unobstructed equality of the defiled and pure Dharma realm, and the unlimited great compassion of the same essence will not accomplish the fruit of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b20_18']	如是十迴向，均十信、十住、十行及十地、十一地行門總在其中。	如是十迴向，均十信、十住、十行及十地、十一地行門總在其中。	022	Thus, the ten grounds of practice equally include the practices of the ten faiths, ten abodes, ten practices, ten grounds, and eleventh ground.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b22_15']	此義十地位中更不別配佛果，但取此位十箇佛果上名總同，同名為妙菩薩名號。	此義十地位中更不別配佛果，但取此位十箇佛果上名總同，同名為妙菩薩名號。	022	This meaning is not separately assigned to the stage of Buddhahood within the ten grounds, but simply takes the names of the ten Buddhas in this stage as being the same in general, all being called Wondrous Bodhisattva.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b26_10']	十地位中菩薩上名，與此十迴向位菩薩，總名金剛，但幢與藏別，明妙用之佛果及所行之法與此無殊，但蘊積功終大悲功滿名之為藏，非是異此迴向位外別法也。	十地位中菩薩上名，與此十迴向位菩薩，總名金剛，但幢與藏別，明妙用之佛果及所行之法與此無殊，但蘊積功終大悲功滿名之為藏，非是異此迴向位外別法也。	022	The names of the bodhisattvas in the ten grounds are the same as the names of the bodhisattvas in the ten abodes of the ten grounds, but the banners and treasuries are different. It is clear that the Buddha-hood of wondrous function and the Dharma practiced are no different from this, but the name treasury is given because the merit accumulated is complete and the merit of great compassion is fulfilled, and it is not a Dharma separate from this stage of迴向.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868b29_10']	是故善財十迴向中善友即長者天神地神，所表十地知識，九箇夜天總是女眾、一箇如來為大子時妻，以表純修大悲之位。	是故善財十迴向中善友即長者天神地神，所表十地知識，九箇夜天總是女眾、一箇如來為大子時妻，以表純修大悲之位。	022	Therefore, in the ten 迴向 of Sudhana, the good and virtuous friends are elders, celestial spirits, earth spirits, and so forth. The knowledge of the ten grounds is represented by nine night goddesses, all of whom are female beings, and one is the wife of the Tathagata when he was a prince, in order to represent the stage of pure cultivation of great compassion.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c02_17']	明十住十行智位，十迴向以願力均融，令智悲等進十地蘊修，令大智大悲深廣成備故，以十箇女眾表之。	明十住十行智位，十迴向以願力均融，令智悲等進十地蘊修，令大智大悲深廣成備故，以十箇女眾表之。	022	Illuminating the ten abodes and ten practices of the stage of wisdom, the ten grounds of aspiration use the power of vows to harmonize and balance wisdom and compassion, enabling the cultivation of the ten grounds to advance, causing the great wisdom and great compassion to become profound and vast. Therefore, ten groups of women are used to symbolize this.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c05_4']	十一地悲智滿成普賢行門，即明以悲興智，即以佛母摩耶為十一地初善知識，能生一切諸佛為表。	十一地悲智滿成普賢行門，即明以悲興智，即以佛母摩耶為十一地初善知識，能生一切諸佛為表。	022	In the eleventh ground, compassion and wisdom are fulfilled, and the gateway of Samantabhadra's practices is accomplished. It clarifies using compassion to give rise to wisdom. Using the Buddha's mother Maya as the first good and wise advisor of the eleventh ground, able to give birth to all Buddhas, is used to symbolize this.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c06_12']	母是悲位、佛是智故，以悲生智故，云摩耶生佛故，得幻生法門。	母是悲位、佛是智故，以悲生智故，云摩耶生佛故，得幻生法門。	022	The mother represents the stage of compassion, and the Buddha represents the stage of wisdom. Using compassion to give rise to wisdom, it is said that the Buddha was born from Maya. Therefore, the Dharma door of illusory birth is attained.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c07_16']	此明悲智德成、普賢行滿故，明其進修次第如是安立。	此明悲智德成、普賢行滿故，明其進修次第如是安立。	022	This clarifies that the virtues of compassion and wisdom are accomplished, and the practices of Samantabhadra are fulfilled. Therefore, the sequence of advancement and cultivation is established in this way.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c09_17']	若以修行一時同進，即如善財十住位中第二海門國海雲比丘是，成就初發心住悲智門。	若以修行一時同進，即如善財十住位中第二海門國海雲比丘是，成就初發心住悲智門。	022	If it is said that cultivation progresses simultaneously, it is like Sudhana's second good and wise advisor in the stage of the ten abodes, the bhikṣu Samudrareņu in the country of Samudra, who accomplished the gateway of compassion and wisdom in the initial stage of generating the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c11_4']	以此義故，於中有阿脩羅王等十王，是表入生死之行故。	以此義故，於中有阿脩羅王等十王，是表入生死之行故。	022	For this reason, there are ten kings such as the Asura kings in the middle, which symbolize the practice of entering birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c13_6']	又海雲是此迴向位中能入生死大海故，又生死海即佛海故，故云有佛出現說《普眼經》。	又海雲是此迴向位中能入生死大海故，又生死海即佛海故，故云有佛出現說《普眼經》。	022	Moreover, since Saṃghavarman is able to enter the great ocean of birth and death in this stage of dedication, and since the ocean of birth and death is precisely the ocean of buddhas, it is said that a buddha appears and expounds the Sūtra of Universal Vision.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c13_18']	著十王等，表萬行自在也。	著十王等，表萬行自在也。	022	The ten kings and others symbolize the mastery of myriad practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c15_6']	乃至十住第七住休捨優婆夷等亦是，但以成熟慣習增降處論之。	乃至十住第七住休捨優婆夷等亦是，但以成熟慣習增降處論之。	022	Up to the seventh abode of the ten abodes, the upāsikā Supriyā and others are also like this, but they are discussed in terms of the increase and decrease of mature habitual tendencies.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c16_15']	又此五位法門，總不出一剎那際，始終成故，總無前後之義故。	又此五位法門，總不出一剎那際，始終成故，總無前後之義故。	022	Moreover, the dharma gates of these five stages do not go beyond a single instant, because they are accomplished from beginning to end, and there is no meaning of sequence in general.
['ZH_T36_1739_022:0868c18_2']	如第二十段，以法施善根迴向莊嚴佛剎中，此是願力莊嚴。	如第二十段，以法施善根迴向莊嚴佛剎中，此是願力莊嚴。	022	Like the second section, using the wholesome roots of giving the Dharma to dedicate to adorning the buddha lands, this is the adornment of the power of vows.

All the Dharma that is entered is the same as what the Buddha has attained, clarifying that faith arises from seeing the Buddha of Immovable Wisdom on the basis of one's own ignorance.

The merit is completed, and one does not establish one's own stage of buddhahood. It clarifies that in the ten grounds, the power of great vows has already been perfected, and the matters of principle, wisdom, and great compassion are completed. The ten grounds only use the power of practices that assist the path to accomplish and mature them, up to the eleventh ground of buddhahood, which is the same as the stage of the ten grounds of the perfections.

Therefore, there are these thirty-eight bodhisattvas.

It is not discussing the positions of a human king or Brahma king, but only discussing the positions where, with the wisdom body of the Tathagata, equal to the Dharma realm and the realm of sentient beings, the body appears before all sentient beings, not discussing the mind-born body that goes wherever one wishes.
