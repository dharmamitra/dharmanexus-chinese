['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c12_11']	如諸親友所對怨敵，親友相違名非親友，非異親友、非親友無。	如諸親友所對怨敵，親友相違名非親友，非異親友、非親友無。	010	Like the enemies that oppose close friends, the opposite of close friends is called non-friend, not different from friends, not the absence of friends.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c14_1']	諦語名實，此所對治虛誑言論名為非實，非異於實、亦非實無。	諦語名實，此所對治虛誑言論名為非實，非異於實、亦非實無。	010	Truthful speech is called real, and the opposite of this, deceptive speech, is called non-real, not different from real, also not the absence of real.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c15_1']	等言為顯非法非義，非事等性非異非無。	等言為顯非法非義，非事等性非異非無。	010	The word etc. is used to show that non-Dharma and non-meaning, the nature of non-events, etc., are not different and not absent.

['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c17_0']	說為結等故，　　非惡慧見故，	說為結等故，　　非惡慧見故，	010	Because it is said to be bonds, etc., because it is not evil wisdom or views,

['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c21_11']	經說無明以為結縛、隨眠及漏、軛、瀑、流等，非餘眼等及體全無可得說為結縛等事，故有別法說名無明。	經說無明以為結縛、隨眠及漏、軛、瀑、流等，非餘眼等及體全無可得說為結縛等事，故有別法說名無明。	010	The sutras say that ignorance is bonds, fetters, latent tendencies, outflows, yokes, floods, and so on. It cannot be said that the other faculties such as the eye, or the complete absence of a substance, are the things called bonds, fetters, and so on. Therefore there is a separate dharma called ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c23_2']	如惡妻子名無妻子，如是惡慧應名無明，彼非無明有是見故。	如惡妻子名無妻子，如是惡慧應名無明，彼非無明有是見故。	010	Just as evil wives and children are called having no wives and children, so evil wisdom should be called ignorance. It is not ignorance because it has views.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c24_2']	諸染污慧名為惡慧，於中有見故非無明。	諸染污慧名為惡慧，於中有見故非無明。	010	All defiled wisdom is called evil wisdom. Because there are views within it, it is not ignorance.

['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c29_1']	如貪異類能染於心。	如貪異類能染於心。	010	Just as craving, which is of a different class, can defile the mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0051c29_15']	無明亦應異慧能染，如何不許？	無明亦應異慧能染，如何不許？	010	Ignorance, which is also different from discernment, can defile it. Why not allow this?
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a03_1']	諸染污慧間雜善慧令不清淨說為能染，如貪染心令不解脫，豈必現起與心相應方說能染？	諸染污慧間雜善慧令不清淨說為能染，如貪染心令不解脫，豈必現起與心相應方說能染？	010	Defiled discernment is mixed with good discernment and makes it impure, and it is said to defile it, just as craving defiles the mind and prevents liberation. How can it be said to defile the mind unless it actually occurs and is associated with the mind?
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a04_10']	然由貪力損縛於心令不解脫，後轉滅彼貪熏習時心便解脫。	然由貪力損縛於心令不解脫，後轉滅彼貪熏習時心便解脫。	010	However, by the power of craving, the mind is damaged and bound and prevented from liberation. Later, when the perfuming of that craving is eliminated, the mind is liberated.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a06_2']	如是無明染污於慧令不清淨，非慧相應，但由無明損濁於慧。	如是無明染污於慧令不清淨，非慧相應，但由無明損濁於慧。	010	In the same way, ignorance defiles discernment and prevents purity, but it is not associated with discernment. It only damages and pollutes discernment.

['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a08_2']	然異慧類別有無明，如貪異心，此說為善。	然異慧類別有無明，如貪異心，此說為善。	010	However, there is a separate ignorance that is a class apart from discernment, just as craving is a class apart from mind. This explanation is good.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a09_2']	有執煩惱皆是無明，此亦應同前理遮遣。	有執煩惱皆是無明，此亦應同前理遮遣。	010	There is an opinion that all passions are ignorance. This also should be refuted by the same principle as above.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a11_2']	若諸煩惱皆是無明，於結等中不應別說，亦不應與見等相應，見等不應自相應故。	若諸煩惱皆是無明，於結等中不應別說，亦不應與見等相應，見等不應自相應故。	010	If all passions are ignorance, then ignorance should not be listed separately among the fetters, etc., nor should it be associated with views, etc., because views, etc., are not associated with themselves.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a12_11']	或亦應說無明染心，若謂此中就差別說，應於染慧不說總名。	或亦應說無明染心，若謂此中就差別說，應於染慧不說總名。	010	Or, it should be said that ignorance defiles mind. If it is said that this is a special case, then it should not be said that ignorance is a general term for defiled discernment.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a13_12']	既許無明別法為體，應說此體其相云何。	既許無明別法為體，應說此體其相云何。	010	Since it is admitted that ignorance has a substance that is a separate dharma, it should be explained what its characteristics are.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a14_3']	謂不了知諦實業果。	謂不了知諦實業果。	010	It is the non-understanding of the truths, actions, and their results.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a14_12']	未測何相名不了知？	未測何相名不了知？	010	It has not been determined what characteristics non-understanding has.
['ZH_T29_1558_010:0052a15_3']	為異了知、為此非有？	為異了知、為此非有？	010	Is it different from understanding, or does it not exist?

Therefore, it is known that the nature of self-conceit is different from the conceit of 'I am.'
