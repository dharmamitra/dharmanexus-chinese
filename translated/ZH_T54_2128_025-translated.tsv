First Scroll of the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, Chapter 1 on Life. Huìlín says: Although the words created by Master Yún are verbose and seem like chapter commentaries, I now take them to be comprehensive and not losing the meaning of the sūtra. Because they surpass the sounds used by other families, the later Southern Edition of the Nirvāṇa Sūtra in 36 scrolls uses these sounds. The sound and meaning are based on what was created by Master Yún. Only the dhāraṇīs and the Sanskrit letters in the treatises that are distant and not precise, Huìlín now again relies on the Sanskrit text to translate them correctly. The reader should examine them carefully. Great - the Cangjie Chapter says it means huge and all-encompassing. The Yijing says: How great is the primordial qi of Qian, the beginning of all things!
