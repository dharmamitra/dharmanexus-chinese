['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889a22_9']	諸許眼等識者，於所棄事及所收事，或捨或取，是觀察果故。	諸許眼等識者，於所棄事及所收事，或捨或取，是觀察果故。	001	Those who admit the eye consciousness and so forth, regarding what is to be discarded and what is to be accepted, either abandon or take up, because this is the result of contemplation.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889a23_3']	所捨事體及顛倒因，是所顯示。	所捨事體及顛倒因，是所顯示。	001	The substance of what is to be discarded and the cause of delusion are what is being shown.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889a24_15']	此中等言，謂攝他許依其色根五種之識，由他於彼一向執為緣實事故。	此中等言，謂攝他許依其色根五種之識，由他於彼一向執為緣實事故。	001	The word and so forth here refers to the five kinds of consciousness that others admit as depending on the material sense faculties, because others are unilaterally attached to them as having real objects as their conditions.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889a25_6']	意識不然，非一向故；	意識不然，非一向故；	001	The mental consciousness is not so, because it is not unilateral;
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889a25_16']	許世俗有，緣車等故。	許世俗有，緣車等故。	001	It is admitted to exist conventionally, because it has as its objects such things as chariots.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889a27_3']	縱許意識緣實事境有其片分，亦能將識相似之相，離無其境。	縱許意識緣實事境有其片分，亦能將識相似之相，離無其境。	001	Even if it is admitted that the mental consciousness has as its objects real things in part, it is also able to take the similar characteristics of consciousness apart from the absence of its objects.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889a28_11']	於眼等識，境不相離，得成就已，方為成立，是故於此不致慇懃。	於眼等識，境不相離，得成就已，方為成立，是故於此不致慇懃。	001	Since the object is not separate from the eye consciousness, etc., once it is established, it is then established. Therefore, it is not necessary to be diligent in this case.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b01_3']	又復於串修果、智所了色，誠非呾迦所行境故，及如所見而安立故。	又復於串修果、智所了色，誠非呾迦所行境故，及如所見而安立故。	001	Moreover, the form cognized by the fruition of repeated cultivation and wisdom is truly not the object of the Tarka school, and because it is established as seen.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b03_1']	今此但觀聞思生得智之境也，如斯意識所緣之境全成非有，此於自聚不能緣故；	今此但觀聞思生得智之境也，如斯意識所緣之境全成非有，此於自聚不能緣故；	001	Now, this only observes the object of the wisdom born from hearing and contemplation, and in this way, the object grasped by mental consciousness is completely non-existent, because it cannot grasp its own aggregates;
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b03_15']	復緣過未非實事故，猶若無為。	復緣過未非實事故，猶若無為。	001	and because it grasps the past and future, which are not real things, just like the unconditioned.

['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b06_5']	非此共其根識同時或復無間，皆滅色等為所緣故；	非此共其根識同時或復無間，皆滅色等為所緣故；	001	It is not that this [mental consciousness] simultaneously or immediately after the sense consciousnesses all grasp form, etc., as their objects;
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b06_19']	或緣現在，此非根識曾所領故。	或緣現在，此非根識曾所領故。	001	or because it grasps the present, which has not been previously experienced by the sense consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b08_8']	斯乃意識自能親緣外境體性，此則遂成無聾盲等，復違比量。	斯乃意識自能親緣外境體性，此則遂成無聾盲等，復違比量。	001	This would mean that mental consciousness itself can directly perceive the nature of external objects, which would then result in the absence of deafness, blindness, etc., and also contradict inference.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b09_11']	知有別根，此遮增色，是所欲故，然於意識不復存懷。	知有別根，此遮增色，是所欲故，然於意識不復存懷。	001	Knowing that there are separate faculties, this refutes the addition of form, because it is what is desired, but still there is no concern for mental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b10_6']	眼等諸識，色為依緣而方有故。	眼等諸識，色為依緣而方有故。	001	Because the various consciousnesses such as the eye are dependent on form as their support and condition,
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b11_6']	無表但是不作性故，自許是無，本意如此。	無表但是不作性故，自許是無，本意如此。	001	and because the non-manifest is merely the nature of non-action, it is accepted as non-existent, this is the original intention.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b12_7']	此於所緣將為現量，是所取性故，深履邪途故。	此於所緣將為現量，是所取性故，深履邪途故。	001	This is about to become direct perception regarding the object, because it is the nature of what is grasped, and because it deeply treads the wrong path.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b13_5']	為此正意遮所緣性，因便方遮斯所依性；	為此正意遮所緣性，因便方遮斯所依性；	001	For this correct intention, it refutes the nature of the object, and by the way it then refutes the nature of its support;
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b13_20']	同時之根、功能之色，將設許之。	同時之根、功能之色，將設許之。	001	the simultaneous faculties and the form of function, it is about to allow.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b14_13']	言外境者，彼執離斯而有別境。	言外境者，彼執離斯而有別境。	001	As for external objects, they are grasped apart from this, and there are separate objects.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b15_12']	此顯其倒，顯彼執有異事可取，故言境也。	此顯其倒，顯彼執有異事可取，故言境也。	001	This reveals its error, revealing that what is grasped is different from the grasped object, therefore it is called the object.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b16_2']	如何當說或緣總聚？	如何當說或緣總聚？	001	How can it be said to be based on a general aggregation?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b16_12']	由非總聚，實事應理。	由非總聚，實事應理。	001	Because it is not reasonable for a real entity to be a collection.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b17_10']	誠如來難，彼自前後道理相違，余復何失。	誠如來難，彼自前後道理相違，余復何失。	001	It is true that the opponent's own earlier and later statements contradict each other, but what fault is there in our position?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b18_4']	緣其實事及緣總聚是所許故。	緣其實事及緣總聚是所許故。	001	Because it is accepted that [the mind] takes real entities as objects and also takes collections as objects.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b18_18']	將欲敘其別過，為此且放斯愆。	將欲敘其別過，為此且放斯愆。	001	In order to point out its specific faults, for now we will let this [question] go.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b20_16']	或許極微，雖復極微唯共聚已而見生滅，然而實體一一皆緣、不緣總聚，猶如色等。	或許極微，雖復極微唯共聚已而見生滅，然而實體一一皆緣、不緣總聚，猶如色等。	001	Even though the extremely subtle [atoms] are only seen as a collection when they have already come together, the real entities are each taken as objects, not a collection, just like form and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b23_3']	設自諸根悉皆現前、境不雜亂，彼根功能各決定故，而於實事斷割有能，一一極微成所緣境，彼因性故。	設自諸根悉皆現前、境不雜亂，彼根功能各決定故，而於實事斷割有能，一一極微成所緣境，彼因性故。	001	Even if all one's own sense faculties are present and the objects are not mixed up, because the faculties each have a determined function, one is able to discern real entities, and each extremely subtle [atom] becomes the object of perception, because it is the causal nature [of perception].
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b24_2']	彼眼等識之因性故，是彼生起親支分義。	彼眼等識之因性故，是彼生起親支分義。	001	Because it is the causal nature of eye consciousness and so forth, it is the meaning of being a close component of its arising.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b24_7']	然而有說：	然而有說：	001	However, some say:
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b25_10']	其所緣境是識生因，在諸緣故，或復於彼為總聚者。	其所緣境是識生因，在諸緣故，或復於彼為總聚者。	001	The object of perception is the cause of the arising of consciousness, because it is among the conditions, or it is a collection in that [object].
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b26_13']	彼諸論者執眾極微所有合聚，為此所緣相識生故。	彼諸論者執眾極微所有合聚，為此所緣相識生故。	001	Those logicians hold that the aggregate of all the subtle atoms is the object-condition for the arising of this cognition.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b27_12']	由於總聚而生其智，是故定知彼為所緣。	由於總聚而生其智，是故定知彼為所緣。	001	Because cognition arises in relation to the aggregate, therefore it is definitely known that it is the object-condition.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b27_17']	如有說云：	如有說云：	001	As it is said:
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b28_9']	若識有彼相，彼是此之境。	若識有彼相，彼是此之境。	001	If cognition has that appearance, that is the object of this [cognition].
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889b29_3']	此二論者咸言彼相，應斯理故。	此二論者咸言彼相，應斯理故。	001	These two logicians both say that the appearance should accord with this principle.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c01_14']	若不言因，此因無喻，猶如因等成因等性極微總相是所緣性而成立之。	若不言因，此因無喻，猶如因等成因等性極微總相是所緣性而成立之。	001	If one does not speak of the reason, this reason has no analogy, just like using reasons to establish the nature of reasons, the general characteristics of subtle atoms are the nature of the object-condition, and this is established.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c02_18']	又若自許不於識外緣其實事，應有有法自相違過。	又若自許不於識外緣其實事，應有有法自相違過。	001	Moreover, if one admits that one does not take real things outside of cognition as conditions, one should have the fault of contradicting one's own nature.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c03_19']	然法稱不許，斯乃於他亦皆共許，即以為喻。	然法稱不許，斯乃於他亦皆共許，即以為喻。	001	However, the Dharma is not admitted, and this is also commonly admitted by others, and it is taken as an analogy.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c04_15']	若但如所說，應於所立義而屬當之。	若但如所說，應於所立義而屬當之。	001	If it is only as it is said, it should be applied to the established meaning.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c05_1']	前量意云：	前量意云：	001	The meaning of the previous argument is as follows:
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c06_13']	論本二因但是明因，所以不即是因，以無共成之喻，為此須出彼相應因。	論本二因但是明因，所以不即是因，以無共成之喻，為此須出彼相應因。	001	The two causes in the treatise are only illuminating causes, and the reason why they are not the causes themselves is because there is no analogy of co-accomplishment. For this reason, the corresponding cause must be brought out.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c06_18']	何以如此。	何以如此。	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c08_3']	次復顯己所論之理是無謬妄，明他共許置第五聲。	次復顯己所論之理是無謬妄，明他共許置第五聲。	001	Next, it reveals that the principle of one's own discussion is not erroneous, and it clarifies that others also acknowledge it, placing the fifth sound.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c09_7']	設許為因，猶如共許諸非有事非有性故，非因極微。	設許為因，猶如共許諸非有事非有性故，非因極微。	001	Even if it is acknowledged as a cause, it is like the nature of non-existence of all non-existent things, and therefore it is not a cause of the ultimate atom.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c11_10']	而且縱許諸極微體是其因性，但說不合是所緣性，由非彼相極微相故，此云根識極塵非境。	而且縱許諸極微體是其因性，但說不合是所緣性，由非彼相極微相故，此云根識極塵非境。	001	Moreover, even if it is allowed that the substance of all ultimate atoms is the nature of the cause, it is only said that the non-combination is the nature of the object, because it is not the characteristic of the ultimate atom. This says that the root consciousness and the ultimate dust are not the object.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c13_3']	如根者言，猶如於根縱實是識，親依之因無根相故非彼之境，極微亦爾。	如根者言，猶如於根縱實是識，親依之因無根相故非彼之境，極微亦爾。	001	The word like the root means that even if it is really the cause of the consciousness that relies on it, it is not the object of the root because it does not have the characteristic of the root. The ultimate atom is also like this.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c13_17']	諸無其相彼非斯境者，何謂也？	諸無其相彼非斯境者，何謂也？	001	What is meant by all that do not have its characteristic are not its object?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c14_7']	為此說其名境者等。	為此說其名境者等。	001	For this reason, it explains the name object and so on.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c14_19']	言自性者，謂自共相了者。	言自性者，謂自共相了者。	001	As for self-nature, it means the specific and common characteristics of oneself. The one who understands...
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c15_4']	定也如何？	定也如何？	001	How is it so?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c15_11']	此復名為了耶？	此復名為了耶？	001	Is this also called perception?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c15_17']	如彼相生故。	如彼相生故。	001	Because it arises in the same way as that.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c16_17']	此言意者，同彼相貌而識生起，由隨彼體故。	此言意者，同彼相貌而識生起，由隨彼體故。	001	The meaning of this statement is that consciousness arises in the same appearance as that, because it follows that essence.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c18_5']	此則說名了彼境也，而實離識無別所了，可與其識為因性耶？	此則說名了彼境也，而實離識無別所了，可與其識為因性耶？	001	This is called perceiving that object, but in reality there is no separate object apart from consciousness that can be its cause.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c19_17']	然而但有前境相狀，於其自己猶如鏡像而安布之，共許名斯為了其境。	然而但有前境相狀，於其自己猶如鏡像而安布之，共許名斯為了其境。	001	However, there is only the appearance of the previous object, which is arranged like a reflection in oneself, and it is commonly accepted to be called the perception of that object.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c20_12']	然非極微一一自體，識隨彼狀。	然非極微一一自體，識隨彼狀。	001	However, it is not the case that consciousness follows the appearance of each individual essence of the atoms.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c22_6']	由此極微而為境體，縱有因性，由非因義，所緣如根，雖是因性，不為所緣。	由此極微而為境體，縱有因性，由非因義，所緣如根，雖是因性，不為所緣。	001	Therefore, even if the atoms were the essence of the object and had the nature of a cause, because of the meaning of not being a cause, the object of cognition is like the sense faculty, and although it has the nature of a cause, it is not the object of cognition.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c23_4']	若由因性許作所緣，根亦同斯，應成彼也。	若由因性許作所緣，根亦同斯，應成彼也。	001	If it is accepted that the object of cognition is made by the nature of a cause, then the sense faculty would also be the same and should be considered as such.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c24_1']	斯言前說彼相應理，故因有不成過。	斯言前說彼相應理，故因有不成過。	001	This statement is reasonable, so the reason is inconclusive.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c24_18']	然而意顯非唯因性即是其根所緣之相。	然而意顯非唯因性即是其根所緣之相。	001	However, the meaning is not that the nature of the cause is precisely the characteristic of the object-support of the sense faculty.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c26_3']	若如所說因將為能立者，則彼因性故為所緣性耶？	若如所說因將為能立者，則彼因性故為所緣性耶？	001	If, as stated, the nature of the cause is taken to be the proof, then is the nature of the cause the nature of the object-support?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c26_12']	於根亦有成不定過。	於根亦有成不定過。	001	There is also the fault of non-determination with respect to the sense faculty.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c27_7']	若如是者，由非彼相，其義何也？	若如是者，由非彼相，其義何也？	001	If it is like this, what is the meaning of not by that characteristic?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c28_9']	為明成立自己之宗，由非但述他宗過故己義便成。	為明成立自己之宗，由非但述他宗過故己義便成。	001	It is to clarify the establishment of one's own tenet, because by merely pointing out the faults of the other's tenet, one's own meaning is not necessarily established.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c29_4']	此言為彰非即能生自識相故。	此言為彰非即能生自識相故。	001	This statement is to show that it is not precisely the characteristic that produces one's own consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0889c29_14']	境非極微，猶如眼等。	境非極微，猶如眼等。	001	The object is not an atom, just like the eye, etc.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a01_17']	若其是彼因性之言，將為論主前立他宗、明他共許。	若其是彼因性之言，將為論主前立他宗、明他共許。	001	If the word nature of the cause is taken to be the proponent's previous establishment of the other's tenet and the other's common acceptance,
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a02_16']	此時意在遮他顯己，能破義成，置斯言矣。	此時意在遮他顯己，能破義成，置斯言矣。	001	at this time the intention is to refute the other and reveal one's own, and the meaning of the refutation is accomplished, so this statement is made.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a03_11']	宗許定彼，不定他宗，恐其不許。	宗許定彼，不定他宗，恐其不許。	001	The proponent's tenet definitely determines that, and does not determine the other's tenet, fearing that it may not be accepted.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a04_13']	向者與他出不定成，即是能破，何假自宗更由比量？	向者與他出不定成，即是能破，何假自宗更由比量？	001	Previously, pointing out the non-determination to the other is precisely the refutation, so why is it necessary for one's own tenet to rely on inference again?
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a05_18']	凡言不定，未必決定不成，恐致疑惑，是故更須立量。	凡言不定，未必決定不成，恐致疑惑，是故更須立量。	001	When it is said that something is indeterminate, it does not necessarily mean that it is definitely not established. Fearing that it may lead to doubt, therefore it is necessary to establish a logical argument again.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a07_6']	或可由斯非彼相者，於諸極微非定了性，如相識生是謂決了。	或可由斯非彼相者，於諸極微非定了性，如相識生是謂決了。	001	Or it may be that because of this, the characteristics of those are not definitely determined in the case of the most subtle particles, just as the arising of consciousness with characteristics is called definite understanding.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a08_10']	既彼非故，明知決了此亦無由，應可說非決了性故。	既彼非故，明知決了此亦無由，應可說非決了性故。	001	Since those are not the case, it is clear that definite understanding is also without basis. It should be said that because of the nature of non-definite understanding.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a09_6']	惟出此因不是所緣，如根極微。	惟出此因不是所緣，如根極微。	001	Only this reason is brought out, which is not the object, like the most subtle particles of the faculties.
['ZH_T31_1625_001:0890a10_18']	有餘復作諸識差別，顯其成立眼識不能了極微色，無彼相故，如餘根識。	有餘復作諸識差別，顯其成立眼識不能了極微色，無彼相故，如餘根識。	001	Some others also make distinctions among the various consciousnesses, showing their establishment.
