The disciples of the Buddha, relying on the teachings, diligently cultivate and realize the true nature of dharmas. Therefore, what they expound for the sake of others is all in accord with the nature of dharmas. Thus, the words of the Buddha are like the transmission of light from a lamp.🔽Śāriputra!
