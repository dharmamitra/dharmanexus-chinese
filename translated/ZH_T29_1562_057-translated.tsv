Thus, although there are innumerable natures such as latent afflictions, they are generally established as the five categories of the three realms, and although the abandonment of latent afflictions and so forth is also innumerable according to the objects to which they are bound, the nine kinds of complete knowledge are established based on the superior stage.

['ZH_T29_1562_057:0657c24_12']	下八地攝見斷隨眠，聖見道斷凡修道斷，修斷聖凡俱修道斷。	下八地攝見斷隨眠，聖見道斷凡修道斷，修斷聖凡俱修道斷。	The proclivities eliminated by the path of seeing that are included in the lower eight stages are eliminated by the noble path of seeing and eliminated by the mundane path of cultivation.

Therefore, the meaning of the present explanation is no different from the previous one. For this reason, it should not be repeated in the verses, because repeating what has already been said is useless.

Based on them, in the stage of realizing the truths, the aspects of various forbearances and knowledges, etc. are established, just like the four right efforts, the investigations of renunciation, etc.

['ZH_T29_1562_057:0658a29_13']	謂諸有漏皆取蘊攝，佛說取蘊名為苦諦。	謂諸有漏皆取蘊攝，佛說取蘊名為苦諦。	This is because all contaminated dharmas are included in the aggregates of grasping, and the Buddha says that the aggregates of grasping are called the truth of suffering.

['ZH_T29_1562_057:0658b07_8']	非愛自性苦諦不攝，可愛斷盡名苦滅諦。	非愛自性苦諦不攝，可愛斷盡名苦滅諦。	Craving is not the truth of suffering, because it is not the nature of suffering, and the annihilation of what is lovable is called the truth of the cessation of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_057:0658b09_8']	若謂諸愛是眾苦因，故愛斷盡時說眾苦皆滅，此亦無失，許殊勝苦得永斷時眾苦滅故。	若謂諸愛是眾苦因，故愛斷盡時說眾苦皆滅，此亦無失，許殊勝苦得永斷時眾苦滅故。	If you say that craving is the cause of suffering, and therefore when craving is annihilated, it is said that all suffering is extinguished, this is not a fault, because we admit that when the most excellent suffering is eternally eliminated, all suffering is extinguished.
['ZH_T29_1562_057:0658b10_10']	如取蘊一分得永斷盡時，可說一切取蘊皆滅。	如取蘊一分得永斷盡時，可說一切取蘊皆滅。	When a part of the aggregates of grasping is eternally eliminated, it is said that all aggregates of grasping are extinguished.

The previous scripture shows that craving is the object of the view of the body. Therefore, we know that the scriptures admit that craving is included in the truth of suffering.

If craving were definitely not included in the truth of suffering, then craving would only be the cause of the result of suffering. How could it be further advised to know the cause of craving?
['ZH_T29_1562_057:0658b22_13']	愛既有因故亦是果，既亦是果亦苦諦攝。	愛既有因故亦是果，既亦是果亦苦諦攝。	Since craving has causes, it is also a result. Since it is also a result, it is included in the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_057:0658b23_12']	故有漏法為果性邊皆是苦諦，理善成立。	故有漏法為果性邊皆是苦諦，理善成立。	Therefore, it is well established that all contaminated dharmas, as far as they are of the nature of results, are included in the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_057:0658b25_1']	諸有漏法為因性邊皆集諦攝，非唯是愛，以契經說是應斷故。	諸有漏法為因性邊皆集諦攝，非唯是愛，以契經說是應斷故。	All contaminated dharmas, as far as they are of the nature of causes, are included in the truth of the origin. It is not only craving, because a scripture says that they should be eliminated.

It is craving in the thinking process.

Craving is a general name for all dharmas that are born with craving. In order to establish the differences in the activities of craving, etc., and their associates, therefore, the associated ignorance is also said to be called this and that joy and love.🔽🔽

Craving is a general name for all dharmas that are associated with craving. In order to establish the differences in the activities of craving, etc., and their associated dharmas, the ignorance associated with them is also said to be the various delights and cravings. Therefore, in accordance with the needs of those to be converted, the Buddha spoke of craving as the truth of the origin of suffering with a special intention. One should not insist on the literal meaning of the name and say that the truth of the origin of suffering is only craving, which is the cause of the continuation of future lives.

Since the species of contaminated and uncontaminated dharmas are different, the noble path cannot be the cause of suffering, because it is not of the same species as suffering. Nor can the noble path be the result of suffering, because it is not the outflow of suffering. Therefore, it cannot be said that the noble path is the truth of origination.
