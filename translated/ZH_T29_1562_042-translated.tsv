['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b09_7']	10 十辯業品第四之十今應思擇成業道相，謂齊何量名自殺生，乃至齊何名為邪見？	10 十辯業品第四之十今應思擇成業道相，謂齊何量名自殺生，乃至齊何名為邪見？	042	Chapter 4, part 10 on the ten debates and karmic paths. Now we should contemplate the characteristics of completing the karmic paths. That is, to what extent is it called killing oneself, and to what extent is it called wrong view?
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b09_19']	且先分別殺生相者，頌曰：	且先分別殺生相者，頌曰：	042	First, let us distinguish the characteristics of killing. The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b10_13']	殺生由故思，　　他想不誤殺。	殺生由故思，　　他想不誤殺。	042	Killing is due to intentional thought, the thought of another, not mistakenly killing.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b11_2']	論曰：	論曰：	042	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b12_10']	要由先發欲殺故思，於他有情他有情想，作殺加行不誤而殺。	要由先發欲殺故思，於他有情他有情想，作殺加行不誤而殺。	042	It is necessary to first give rise to the intentional thought of wanting to kill. Regarding other sentient beings, one has the conception of other sentient beings. One performs the karmic activity of killing without error.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b13_8']	謂唯殺彼，不漫殺餘，齊此名為殺生業道。	謂唯殺彼，不漫殺餘，齊此名為殺生業道。	042	That is to say, one only kills them, not mistakenly killing others. This is called the karmic path of killing.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b14_7']	有懷猶豫為杌為人，設復是人為彼非彼？	有懷猶豫為杌為人，設復是人為彼非彼？	042	Some have doubts, thinking it might be a stump or a person. Even if it is a person, is it them or not?
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b14_12']	因起決志：	因起決志：	042	Therefore, one gives rise to a resolute intention:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b15_2']	若是若非我定當殺。	若是若非我定當殺。	042	Whether it is them or not, I will definitely kill them.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b15_16']	由心無顧，若殺有情亦成業道。	由心無顧，若殺有情亦成業道。	042	Because the mind is without regard, if one kills a sentient being, one also completes the karmic path.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b16_16']	如是業道，若定若疑，但具殺緣皆有成理。	如是業道，若定若疑，但具殺緣皆有成理。	042	If the object of killing is certain or doubtful, and the conditions of killing are complete, then there is a completed offense.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b17_13']	於剎那滅行殺罪，如何成、如何不成？	於剎那滅行殺罪，如何成、如何不成？	042	How is it that one commits the offense of killing in the case of momentary dharmas? How is it that one does not commit the offense?
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b17_18']	無殺義故。	無殺義故。	042	Because there is no meaning of killing.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b19_5']	謂眾生命過去已滅、現在自滅、未來未至，是故必無殺生命理。	謂眾生命過去已滅、現在自滅、未來未至，是故必無殺生命理。	042	That is, the life of a sentient being has already ceased in the past, ceases by itself in the present, and has not yet arrived in the future. Therefore, there is definitely no principle of killing a sentient being.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b20_4']	如何說滅，燈焰鈴聲准彼亦應通殺生義。	如何說滅，燈焰鈴聲准彼亦應通殺生義。	042	How do you explain the cessation of the flame of a lamp or the sound of a bell? The meaning of killing should also be understood in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b23_2']	謂障當命應生不生，以起惡心行殺加行，令所殺者現命滅時，不能為因引同類命，障應生命令永不生，故名殺生，由斯獲罪。	謂障當命應生不生，以起惡心行殺加行，令所殺者現命滅時，不能為因引同類命，障應生命令永不生，故名殺生，由斯獲罪。	042	That is, one obstructs the life that should arise in the future and does not allow it to arise. By giving rise to an evil mind and carrying out the preparatory action of killing, when the life of the object to be killed ceases in the present, it cannot serve as a cause to attract a life of the same kind. It obstructs the life that should arise in the future and prevents it from ever arising. Therefore, it is called killing, and one obtains the offense because of this.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b23_11']	此所斷命為屬於誰？	此所斷命為屬於誰？	042	To whom does the life that is severed belong?
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b25_8']	謂命若無，彼名死者，即是此命所依附身，標第六聲顯相屬義，如伽他說壽煖等言。	謂命若無，彼名死者，即是此命所依附身，標第六聲顯相屬義，如伽他說壽煖等言。	042	If life does not exist, he is called a dead person. That is, the body to which this life is attached is indicated by the sixth case ending to show the relationship, just as the verse says life, warmth, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b26_8']	故有命身名有命者，非實有我，其理決然。	故有命身名有命者，非實有我，其理決然。	042	Therefore, the body that possesses life is called one who possesses life, but it is definitely not a real self.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b27_1']	已分別殺生，當辯不與取。	已分別殺生，當辯不與取。	042	Having already distinguished killing, we should discuss taking what is not given.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b27_4']	頌曰：	頌曰：	042	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b28_13']	不與取他物，　　力竊取屬己。	不與取他物，　　力竊取屬己。	042	Taking what is not given is taking another's property by force or stealth.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b29_2']	論曰：	論曰：	042	Discussion:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578b29_14']	前不誤等言，如應流至後。	前不誤等言，如應流至後。	042	The words not in error and so on should be applied as appropriate to the following.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c03_1']	謂要先發欲盜故思，於他物中起他物想，或力或竊起盜加行，不誤而取令屬己身，齊此名為不與取罪。	謂要先發欲盜故思，於他物中起他物想，或力或竊起盜加行，不誤而取令屬己身，齊此名為不與取罪。	042	This means that one must first give rise to the intention to steal, have the notion of other's property regarding another's property, use force or stealth to carry out the act of stealing, not be in error, and take it to make it one's own. This is called the offense of taking what is not given.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c04_8']	若有盜取窣堵波物，於佛得罪，佛將涅槃總受世間所施物故。	若有盜取窣堵波物，於佛得罪，佛將涅槃總受世間所施物故。	042	If one steals property from a stupa, one commits an offense against the Buddha, because when the Buddha is about to enter nirvana, he generally accepts offerings from the world.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c04_11']	有說：	有說：	042	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c04_18']	此罪於能護人。	此罪於能護人。	042	This offense is against the one who has custody.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c05_8']	則彼自恣，應無有罪。	則彼自恣，應無有罪。	042	Then they should be able to do as they please without committing an offense.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c05_17']	是故前說於理為勝。	是故前說於理為勝。	042	Therefore, the previous explanation is superior in principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c06_16']	盜亡僧物，已作羯磨，於界內僧得偷盜罪；	盜亡僧物，已作羯磨，於界內僧得偷盜罪；	042	If one steals property belonging to the monastic community that has already been distributed, one commits the offense of stealing from the monastic community within the boundary.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c07_6']	羯磨未了，於一切僧。	羯磨未了，於一切僧。	042	If the karma is not yet completed, it is in relation to the entire Sangha.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c08_6']	若盜他人及象馬等，出所住處，業道方成。	若盜他人及象馬等，出所住處，業道方成。	042	If one steals others' elephants, horses, etc., and takes them out of their dwelling place, then the karmic path is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c08_18']	已辯不與取，當辯欲邪行。	已辯不與取，當辯欲邪行。	042	Having explained taking what is not given, we will now discuss sexual misconduct.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c09_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	042	A verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c10_13']	欲邪行四種，　　行所不應行。	欲邪行四種，　　行所不應行。	042	Sexual misconduct has four types, engaging in what should not be engaged in.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c11_2']	論曰：	論曰：	042	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c12_1']	總有四種行不應行，皆得名為欲邪行罪。	總有四種行不應行，皆得名為欲邪行罪。	042	In total there are four types of engaging in what should not be engaged in, all of which can be called the sin of sexual misconduct.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c13_10']	一於非境，謂他所護，或母或父或父母親，乃至或夫所守護境。	一於非境，謂他所護，或母或父或父母親，乃至或夫所守護境。	042	First, in regard to inappropriate objects, such as those protected by others, whether mother, father, parents' relatives, up to those protected by a husband.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c14_4']	二於非道，謂設己妻口及餘道。	二於非道，謂設己妻口及餘道。	042	Second, in inappropriate body parts, referring to one's own wife's mouth and other body parts.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c14_19']	三於非處，謂於制多、寺中逈處。	三於非處，謂於制多、寺中逈處。	042	Third, in inappropriate places, referring to stupas, temples, and open spaces.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c15_18']	四於非時，謂懷胎時、飲兒乳時、受齋戒時。	四於非時，謂懷胎時、飲兒乳時、受齋戒時。	042	Fourth, at inappropriate times, referring to when she is pregnant, breastfeeding, or observing precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c16_1']	有說：	有說：	042	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c16_17']	若夫許受齋戒，而有所犯方謂非時。	若夫許受齋戒，而有所犯方謂非時。	042	If the husband has agreed to observe precepts, but violates them, then it is called an inappropriate time.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c19_4']	既不誤言亦流至此，若於他婦謂是己妻、或於己妻謂為他婦，道非道等但有誤心，雖有所行而非業道。	既不誤言亦流至此，若於他婦謂是己妻、或於己妻謂為他婦，道非道等但有誤心，雖有所行而非業道。	042	If one does not make a mistake in speech, one also falls into this category. If one takes another's wife as one's own wife, or one's own wife as another's wife, or takes a non-path as a path, but only has a mistaken mind, even if one engages in action, it is not a karmic path.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c20_18']	若於此他婦作餘他婦想，行非梵行，有說亦成，加行受用時，並於他境故。	若於此他婦作餘他婦想，行非梵行，有說亦成，加行受用時，並於他境故。	042	If one takes another's wife and thinks of her as someone else's wife, and engages in non-brahmacarya conduct, some say it is also accomplished, because the preparation and enjoyment are both directed towards another's object.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c20_21']	有說：	有說：	042	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c21_17']	如殺業道不成加行，究竟時前境各別故。	如殺業道不成加行，究竟時前境各別故。	042	Just as the karmic path of killing is not accomplished, because the preparation and the time of completion are directed towards different objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c22_16']	苾芻尼等如有戒妻，若有侵𣣋亦成業道。	苾芻尼等如有戒妻，若有侵𣣋亦成業道。	042	Bhikṣuṇīs and others who have the wife of a precept-holder, if they are violated, also constitute karmic paths.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c23_1']	有說：	有說：	042	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c23_17']	此罪於所住王，以能護持及不許故。	此罪於所住王，以能護持及不許故。	042	This offense is committed against the king who resides there, because he is able to protect and does not permit it.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c24_17']	若王自犯，業道亦成，故前所說，於理為勝。	若王自犯，業道亦成，故前所說，於理為勝。	042	If the king himself commits an offense, the karmic path is also accomplished. Therefore, the previous explanation is superior in principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c25_8']	已辯欲邪行，當辯虛誑語。	已辯欲邪行，當辯虛誑語。	042	Having explained sexual misconduct, we will now explain false speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c25_11']	頌曰：	頌曰：	042	A verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c26_13']	染異想發言，　　解義虛誑語。	染異想發言，　　解義虛誑語。	042	Being defiled, with a different thought, uttering speech, understanding the meaning, is false speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c27_2']	論曰：	論曰：	042	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0578c28_19']	說聽力故成虛誑語，謂於所說異想發言，及所誑者解所說義，染心不誤方成業道。	說聽力故成虛誑語，謂於所說異想發言，及所誑者解所說義，染心不誤方成業道。	042	Because of the power of the speaker and the hearer, it is called lying. That is, if one utters words with a different idea, and if the deceived person understands the meaning expressed, and if one’s mind is defiled and not mistaken, then it is called a path of action.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a01_7']	所誑未解，雜穢語收，語多字成，要最後念表無表業方成業道。	所誑未解，雜穢語收，語多字成，要最後念表無表業方成業道。	042	If the deceived person does not understand, it is included in frivolous speech. Since speech is composed of many syllables, only the last moment of intimation and nonintimation constitutes a path of action.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a02_6']	或隨所誑解義即成，前字俱行皆此加行。	或隨所誑解義即成，前字俱行皆此加行。	042	Or, it is completed as soon as the deceived person understands the meaning. The syllables that accompany the first moment are the preparatory act.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a03_6']	此中解義，據所誑者能解名解，非正解義。	此中解義，據所誑者能解名解，非正解義。	042	Here, understanding the meaning is called understanding from the point of view of the deceived person’s ability to understand, not from the point of view of understanding the meaning correctly.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a03_15']	齊何名為能解正解？	齊何名為能解正解？	042	What is the point at which one is said to be able to understand correctly?
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a04_14']	前謂解者住耳識時，後謂正能分別其義。	前謂解者住耳識時，後謂正能分別其義。	042	The former is when the one who understands is in the state of the ear consciousness, and the latter is when one is able to discriminate the meaning correctly.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a06_4']	若正解義，義意識知，語表耳識俱時滅故，應此業道唯無表成。	若正解義，義意識知，語表耳識俱時滅故，應此業道唯無表成。	042	If one understands the meaning correctly, the meaning is known by mental consciousness, and speech intimation is extinguished at the same time as the ear consciousness. Therefore, this path of action is only nonintimation.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a07_12']	是故理應善義言者住耳識位業道即成，能誑具足表無表故。	是故理應善義言者住耳識位業道即成，能誑具足表無表故。	042	Therefore, it must be that when one utters good words, the path of action is completed, because the one who deceives is endowed with both intimation and nonintimation.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a07_15']	有言：	有言：	042	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a08_12']	所誑隨解不解，但異想說業道即成。	所誑隨解不解，但異想說業道即成。	042	The deceived person, whether he understands or not, if he has a different idea, the karmic path is completed.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a09_11']	不爾，此同離間語故，隨忍不忍要解方成。	不爾，此同離間語故，隨忍不忍要解方成。	042	If it were not so, this would be the same as divisive speech. Whether the other person accepts it or not, it is completed only if there is understanding.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a11_17']	經說諸言略有十六，謂於不見不聞不覺不知事中言實見等，所見等中言不見等，如是八種名非聖言。	經說諸言略有十六，謂於不見不聞不覺不知事中言實見等，所見等中言不見等，如是八種名非聖言。	042	The sūtra says that there are generally sixteen kinds of speech. That is, in regard to things that are not seen, not heard, not sensed, and not cognized, to say that one really sees them, etc., and in regard to things that are seen, etc., to say that one does not see them, etc. These eight kinds are called non-holy speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a13_6']	不見等中言不見等，所見等中言實見等，如是八種名為聖言。	不見等中言不見等，所見等中言實見等，如是八種名為聖言。	042	In regard to things that are not seen, etc., to say that one does not see them, etc., and in regard to things that are seen, etc., to say that one really sees them, etc. These eight kinds are called holy speech.

['ZH_T29_1562_042:0579a18_8']	鼻舌身根取至境故，總名為覺餘，經定說三根所取為所覺故。	鼻舌身根取至境故，總名為覺餘，經定說三根所取為所覺故。	042	Because the nose, tongue, and body faculties take objects that reach them, they are collectively called awareness. Other scriptures definitely say that what is taken by the three faculties is what is to be cognized.
