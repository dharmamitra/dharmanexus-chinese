['ZH_T24_1450_005:0120c28_18']	所言三者：	所言三者：	What are the three?
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a02_1']	一者濕木有潤從水而出火鑽亦濕，有人遠來求火，以濕火鑽鑽彼濕木欲使生火，火無出法。	一者濕木有潤從水而出火鑽亦濕，有人遠來求火，以濕火鑽鑽彼濕木欲使生火，火無出法。	First, wet wood with moisture taken out of the water, and the fire drill is also wet. If someone comes from afar seeking fire, using the wet fire drill to drill the wet wood, wanting to make fire, fire has no way of arising.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a04_3']	若有沙門婆羅門，身雖離欲心猶愛染，耽欲耽愛、著欲處欲、悅欲伴欲，有如是等常在心中。	若有沙門婆羅門，身雖離欲心猶愛染，耽欲耽愛、著欲處欲、悅欲伴欲，有如是等常在心中。	If there are śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas, although their bodies are free from desires, their minds still have lustful attachments, indulging in desires, being attached to desires, dwelling in desires, delighting in desires, and being companions to desires, such things always remain in their minds.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a06_3']	彼諸人等，縱苦其身受諸極苦，忍諸酸毒受如此受，非正智非正見，不能得於無上正道。	彼諸人等，縱苦其身受諸極苦，忍諸酸毒受如此受，非正智非正見，不能得於無上正道。	Those people, even if they torment their bodies and undergo extreme suffering, endure the bitter pain and experience such feelings, it is not right knowledge and not right views, and they are unable to attain the unsurpassed right path.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a08_1']	二者濕木有潤在於水邊，有人遠來求火，以乾火鑽鑽其潤木，雖欲得火火無然法。	二者濕木有潤在於水邊，有人遠來求火，以乾火鑽鑽其潤木，雖欲得火火無然法。	Second, wet wood with moisture near the water, someone comes from afar seeking fire, using a dry fire drill to drill the moist wood, although wanting to obtain fire, fire has no way of burning.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a09_18']	如是沙門婆羅門，身雖離欲心猶愛染，於諸欲中，耽欲愛欲、著欲處欲、悅欲伴欲。	如是沙門婆羅門，身雖離欲心猶愛染，於諸欲中，耽欲愛欲、著欲處欲、悅欲伴欲。	Thus, śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas, although their bodies are free from desires, their minds still have lustful attachments, in regard to desires, they indulge in desires, love desires, are attached to desires, dwell in desires, delight in desires, and are companions to desires.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a12_2']	有如是過常在身心，縱苦其身受於極苦忍諸酸毒，受如此受，非正智非正見，不能至於無上正道。	有如是過常在身心，縱苦其身受於極苦忍諸酸毒，受如此受，非正智非正見，不能至於無上正道。	If one has such faults always present in body and mind, even if one endures extreme suffering and accepts severe pain, such feelings are not right knowledge or right view, and cannot lead to the unsurpassed right path.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a13_14']	三者朽爛之木無有津潤在於濕岸，有人求火，雖以火鑽鑽之火無然法。	三者朽爛之木無有津潤在於濕岸，有人求火，雖以火鑽鑽之火無然法。	Third, like rotten wood that lacks moisture on a damp shore, even if one seeks fire and drills with a fire drill, there is no way for fire to start.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a15_13']	如是沙門婆羅門，身雖離欲心猶愛染受於苦受，非正智非正見，不能得於無上正道。	如是沙門婆羅門，身雖離欲心猶愛染受於苦受，非正智非正見，不能得於無上正道。	In the same way, although a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa may have separated from desires in body, their mind is still tainted by love and they experience painful feelings. This is not right knowledge or right view, and cannot attain the unsurpassed right path.

The palace ladies and concubines, taking off their jewelry, spread grass to sit on, and also ate a single sesame seed, a single grain of rice, and a single bean each day.
['ZH_T24_1450_005:0121a25_4']	爾時耶輸陀羅以少食故，懷娠漸損。	爾時耶輸陀羅以少食故，懷娠漸損。	At that time, Yaśodharā, due to eating so little, became pregnant and gradually lost weight.
