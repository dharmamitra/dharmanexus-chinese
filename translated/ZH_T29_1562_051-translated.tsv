['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a05_19']	然依此說《勝義空經》，依此不能遮去來有，非遮離行有作者言，能遮去來是實有故。	然依此說《勝義空經》，依此不能遮去來有，非遮離行有作者言，能遮去來是實有故。	However, based on this, the Sūtra on the Emptiness of Ultimate Reality is explained. Based on this, it cannot deny the existence of past and future. The statement that there is no agent apart from action cannot deny it, because it can deny that past and future really exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a07_3']	然此眼根生位無所從來等言，應審尋思此言何義。	然此眼根生位無所從來等言，應審尋思此言何義。	However, the statement that when the eye faculty arises, it does not come from anywhere, etc., should be carefully considered as to what it means.

['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a09_1']	若執猶無，何所疑慮而言生位無所從來？	若執猶無，何所疑慮而言生位無所從來？	If it is grasped as still non-existent, what is there to doubt that it is said to come from nowhere when it arises?
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a09_11']	非諸體無，有從來處。	非諸體無，有從來處。	It is not that all entities are nonexistent, coming from some place.

['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a10_17']	但應明言生位非有，既遮生位有所從來。	但應明言生位非有，既遮生位有所從來。	One should simply clarify that the present state does not exist. Since the present state is refuted as having a place it comes from,
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a12_8']	故知大師不許別有現積集處眼從彼來，次後說滅時無所造集故。	故知大師不許別有現積集處眼從彼來，次後說滅時無所造集故。	one should know that the Great Master does not allow the eye to come from a separate place where it accumulates. The next passage says that when it ceases, it does not create or accumulate anything.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a13_16']	以世間有邪論者，說眼根生位從火輪來，眼根滅時還造集彼。	以世間有邪論者，說眼根生位從火輪來，眼根滅時還造集彼。	Because there are in the world those with wrong theories who say that when the eye faculty arises, it comes from the fire wheel, and when the eye faculty ceases, it returns to create and accumulate that.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a14_6']	遮彼故說此兩句經。	遮彼故說此兩句經。	In order to refute that, these two lines of the sūtra are spoken.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a15_6']	或遮眼根出從自性，沒還歸彼，故說此言。	或遮眼根出從自性，沒還歸彼，故說此言。	Or, in order to refute that the eye faculty emerges from its own nature and perishes, returning to it, these words are spoken.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a16_4']	或遮眼根自在所作，故說如是兩句經文。	或遮眼根自在所作，故說如是兩句經文。	Or, in order to refute that the eye faculty is created by a self, these two lines of the sūtra text are spoken.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a18_11']	謂遮眼根有勝作者，顯彼唯有因果相屬，已遣他宗，為顯自意，故次復說本無今有、有已還去兩句經文。	謂遮眼根有勝作者，顯彼唯有因果相屬，已遣他宗，為顯自意，故次復說本無今有、有已還去兩句經文。	That is, in order to refute that the eye faculty has a superior creator, it is shown that it only has the relationship of cause and effect. Having refuted the other school's position, in order to reveal one's own intention, the next two lines of the sūtra text are then spoken, saying that it did not exist before but now exists, and having existed, it returns.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a19_15']	謂此中所言本無今有者，顯本無集處，從自因緣生。	謂此中所言本無今有者，顯本無集處，從自因緣生。	That is, the words “originally non-existent and now existent” indicate that the aggregates originally did not exist, but now they are born from their own causes and conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a21_4']	或有欲令因是果藏，故佛說果因中本無，但由彼因有別果起。	或有欲令因是果藏，故佛說果因中本無，但由彼因有別果起。	Or, there are those who would have it that the cause is the storehouse of the effect, and for that reason the Buddha says that the effect is originally non-existent in the cause, but only because of the cause does a separate effect arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a23_2']	或此為顯眼根生時，能至本來所未至位，依此義說本無今有，此經文意理必應然。	或此為顯眼根生時，能至本來所未至位，依此義說本無今有，此經文意理必應然。	Or, this is in order to show that when the eye organ is born, it can reach a place that it has not reached previously. The meaning of this scriptural text must be so interpreted.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a24_12']	故次復言有已還去，此顯起作用牽自果已，還去至如本無作用位。	故次復言有已還去，此顯起作用牽自果已，還去至如本無作用位。	Therefore the next sentence says that having existed, it returns and goes away. This shows that having performed its function and attracted its own effect, it returns and goes away to a place where it has no function, as if it had never existed.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a26_11']	若佛為遮去來是有，方便說此本無等言，如前句言本無今有，後句應說有已還無。	若佛為遮去來是有，方便說此本無等言，如前句言本無今有，後句應說有已還無。	If the Buddha, in order to deny that going and coming exist, used the words “originally non-existent” as a skillful means, then in the first sentence he should have said “originally non-existent and now existent,” and in the second sentence he should have said “having existed, it returns to non-existence.”
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a27_10']	既不言無但言還去，則知不許過去是無。	既不言無但言還去，則知不許過去是無。	Since he does not say “non-existent,” but only “returns and goes away,” we know that he does not admit that the past is non-existent.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626a28_17']	非汝所宗許過去有，唯言無有未來眼根，如何引斯契經為證？	非汝所宗許過去有，唯言無有未來眼根，如何引斯契經為證？	Your school does not admit that the past exists, and the scripture only says that the future eye does not exist. How can you cite this scripture as proof?
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b02_6']	說是語已，世尊復觀當有迷斯契經意趣，便謂無有過去未來，增長謗因謗果邪見，為遮彼故復作是言：	說是語已，世尊復觀當有迷斯契經意趣，便謂無有過去未來，增長謗因謗果邪見，為遮彼故復作是言：	Having said this, the World Honored One further observed that there would be those who would be confused about the meaning of this scripture and would say that the past and future do not exist, thus increasing their wrong views of denying causes and effects. In order to stop them, he further said:
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b02_18']	有業有異熟，作者不可得。	有業有異熟，作者不可得。	There is karma and there is ripening, but the doer cannot be apprehended.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b04_6']	此顯要有過去業因，方有未來異熟果起，非更別有作者作用。	此顯要有過去業因，方有未來異熟果起，非更別有作者作用。	This shows that only if there is a past karmic cause will there be the arising of future ripening effects, and there is no further real doer or action.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b05_5']	故為顯示無有實我，唯決定有因果相屬。	故為顯示無有實我，唯決定有因果相屬。	Therefore, in order to reveal that there is no real self, there is only the definite connection between cause and effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b07_3']	如來說此《勝義空經》，非為欲遮去來實有，與前所引經義無違，故前契經是了義說。	如來說此《勝義空經》，非為欲遮去來實有，與前所引經義無違，故前契經是了義說。	When the Tathāgata spoke this Sūtra on the Emptiness of Ultimate Reality, it was not in order to deny the real existence of the past and future. It is not contradictory to the meaning of the sūtras cited above, and therefore the previous sūtras are definitive in meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b07_17']	有說定有遮去來經，如契經言：	有說定有遮去來經，如契經言：	There are those who say that there is definitely a sūtra that denies the past and future, as a sūtra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b08_13']	於無內眼結，如實了知我無內眼結。	於無內眼結，如實了知我無內眼結。	As for the absence of internal eye-bondage, one truly knows that one has no internal eye-bondage.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b08_18']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Again, a sutra says:

['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b10_11']	彼經非證，即彼經中有文證成去來有故。	彼經非證，即彼經中有文證成去來有故。	That sutra is not evidence, because that very sutra has a passage that proves the existence of the past and future.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b10_16']	如彼經言：	如彼經言：	As that sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b12_4']	於有內眼結，如實了知我有內眼結，非善心位有結現行。	於有內眼結，如實了知我有內眼結，非善心位有結現行。	As for the presence of internal eye-bondage, one truly knows that one has internal eye-bondage, not when the mind is wholesome is there the actual presence of the bonds.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b12_13']	故知彼經說有過未。	故知彼經說有過未。	Therefore, we know that that sutra speaks of the existence of the past and future.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b13_12']	又彼經說行有識有，非異熟果異熟因俱。	又彼經說行有識有，非異熟果異熟因俱。	Again, that sutra says that there is action, there is consciousness, but the ripened fruit and the cause of ripening are not together.
['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b14_2']	故知彼經說有過未。	故知彼經說有過未。	Therefore, we know that that sutra speaks of the existence of the past and future.

['ZH_T29_1562_051:0626b16_2']	此證身內定有未來，語文等體為當所說。	此證身內定有未來，語文等體為當所說。	This proves that the future body, speech, and so on definitely exist internally, to be that which is to be explained.
