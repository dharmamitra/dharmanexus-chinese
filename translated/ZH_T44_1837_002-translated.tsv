['ZH_T44_1837_002:0056c15_20']	若依《雜集論》，心所有法五十五，自餘諸數并同此論，唯煩惱六中，開不正見為五，謂薩迦耶見、邊執、見取、戒禁取、邪見。	若依《雜集論》，心所有法五十五，自餘諸數并同此論，唯煩惱六中，開不正見為五，謂薩迦耶見、邊執、見取、戒禁取、邪見。	If we rely on the Abhidharmasamuccayavyākhyā, the mental factors are fifty-five. The other numbers are the same as this treatise. Only among the six afflictions, wrong views are divided into five: the view of a real self, extreme views, the view of holding a view as paramount, the view of holding ethical discipline and ascetic practice as paramount, and wrong views.
