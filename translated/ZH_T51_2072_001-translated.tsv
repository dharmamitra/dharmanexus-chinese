Some cultivate the bodhisattva path, some cultivate the pratyekabuddha path, and some cultivate the śrāvaka path. Each has its own approach and methods. However, among the various methods, the most direct and easy to practice is the practice of contemplating the Buddha and the Pure Land. This is because the Buddha's compassion and blessings are vast and profound, and the Pure Land is a place of peace and joy. If one can single-mindedly contemplate the Buddha and the Pure Land, one will be able to quickly attain rebirth and attain liberation. Therefore, the Buddha taught the practice of contemplating the Buddha and the Pure Land in various sūtras. For example, in the Amitābha Sūtra, the Buddha taught that if one can single-mindedly contemplate the Buddha Amitābha for seven days and nights, one will be able to see the Buddha and attain rebirth in the Pure Land. In the Contemplation Sūtra, the Buddha taught that if one can contemplate the Buddha Amitābha and the Pure Land according to the methods taught in the sūtra, one will be able to attain rebirth in the Pure Land. In the Sūtra of the Buddha's Parinirvāṇa, the Buddha taught that if one can contemplate the Buddha Amitābha and the Pure Land at the time of death, one
