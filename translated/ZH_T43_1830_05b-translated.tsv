['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411a10_4']	非在自有餘識所無名不共等。	非在自有餘識所無名不共等。	It is not that what is present in itself and absent in the other consciousnesses is called unique, etc.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411b10_11']	是主獨行至不造新業。	是主獨行至不造新業。	This is the solitary ignorance that is the master. It does not create new karma.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411b12_3']	唯分別起。	唯分別起。	It is only the ignorance that arises from discrimination.
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411b12_8']	唯見道斷。	唯見道斷。	It is only eliminated by the path of seeing.
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411b12_17']	不與忿等十種相應。	不與忿等十種相應。	It is not concomitant with the ten, such as anger, etc.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411b23_8']	故無此十時唯無明增。	故無此十時唯無明增。	Therefore, when these ten do not exist, only ignorance increases.
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411b23_17']	此隨小乘名為不共。	此隨小乘名為不共。	This [ignorance] is called not shared according to the Hinayana.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411b26_4']	仍是不遍三性心起無明所攝。	仍是不遍三性心起無明所攝。	they are still not universal, arising in minds of the three natures, and are included in ignorance.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411c03_5']	自下第二證六二緣經。	自下第二證六二緣經。	Below this is the second proof of the two conditions of the sixth [consciousness], using a sutra.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411c05_2']	初文可解　世親攝論證六二緣與此有異。	初文可解　世親攝論證六二緣與此有異。	The initial text is understandable. The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra of Vasubandhu proves the two conditions of the sixth [consciousness] differently from this,
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411c05_12']	謂眼等五．本識二故。	謂眼等五．本識二故。	Because the five such as the eye [consciousness] and the fundamental consciousness are the two [conditions].
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411c06_2']	無性．及此據共許緣。	無性．及此據共許緣。	Asvabhāva and this [text] are based on commonly accepted conditions.
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0411c06_11']	世親唯說不共許緣。	世親唯說不共許緣。	Vasubandhu only discusses uncommonly accepted conditions.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0414b06_8']	見分自證緣縛體名見縛。	見分自證緣縛體名見縛。	Is the essence of the seeing part itself bound by the self-authenticating part, and thus called the bondage of seeing?

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0414b08_12']	或所縛見有非．比量。	或所縛見有非．比量。	Or, the view that is bound may be either direct perception or inference.

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0414b12_4']	問有漏有相即名相縛。	問有漏有相即名相縛。	Question: If contaminated minds have characteristics, they are called the bond of characteristics.🔽Does the subsequently acquired knowledge that has characteristics also constitute the bond of characteristics?
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0414b13_2']	後得有相應為相縛　答此亦不然。	後得有相應為相縛　答此亦不然。	Answer: This is also not so.
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0414b15_5']	作證解故　既爾自證應非見縛　此亦不然體是惑故　若爾善心見應非縛　此有漏故。	作證解故　既爾自證應非見縛　此亦不然體是惑故　若爾善心見應非縛　此有漏故。	Because it is the understanding of realization. If that is so, the part that is self-verified should not be bound by the seeing part. This is also not so, because its substance is delusion. If that is so, the good mind should not be bound by the seeing part. This is because it is contaminated,

['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0427b17_6']	但佛多起第四定者。	但佛多起第四定者。	But the Buddha often generates the fourth meditation.
['ZH_T43_1830_05b:0427b18_2']	以殊勝故　又解唯第四定有。	以殊勝故　又解唯第四定有。	Because it is superior. Another explanation is that it exists only in the fourth dhyāna,
