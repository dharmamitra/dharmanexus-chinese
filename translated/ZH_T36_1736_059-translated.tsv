['ZH_T36_1736_059:0466c20_4']	古釋唯取同名色支，識支在前邪見中故。	古釋唯取同名色支，識支在前邪見中故。	The ancient interpretation only takes the same link of name-and-form, because the link of consciousness is in the previous wrong views.
['ZH_T36_1736_059:0466c21_1']	今名色依起者，依彼本識因生耳。	今名色依起者，依彼本識因生耳。	Now, the dependent arising of name-and-form depends on the fundamental consciousness and arises from the cause.
