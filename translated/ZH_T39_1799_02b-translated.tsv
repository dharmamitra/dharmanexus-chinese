They thus imagine that there is a self in the body that always exists and is not extinguished, receiving birth everywhere in the realms of the ten directions.

It seems not to be dependent on causes and conditions, yet is not the same as their [view of] spontaneity. How can I be instructed not to fall into the various heterodox [views], and attain the true mind and the wondrously enlightened and illuminated nature?

At the time of the Laṅkāvatāra, in order to refute the heterodox views that did not understand the perfuming of karmic seeds, which give rise to external dominant [conditions], they mistakenly conceived that crows are naturally black, cranes are naturally white, and so forth. Therefore, the Buddha spoke of dependent origination, based on the principle of dependent arising in the worldly realm.
