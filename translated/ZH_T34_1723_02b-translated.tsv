When Maitreya's path is complete, he will be the master of the cause's completion. In the present world, he encounters conditions and plants many wholesome karmas. How could he see a majestic light and not know, or observe meditative absorption and not understand? This is just showing a semblance of not knowing, asking questions to alert the masses, and is therefore called Maitreya showing doubts.

He alone is called the Prince of the Dharma. He has already been close to and encountered good conditions, made offerings to the buddhas, and deeply planted roots of virtue. Making progress in wealth is called making offerings.

Therefore, he must have seen this rare sign.

Since Mañjuśrī's outer causes are already fulfilled and his inner virtues are also perfected, he is able to know that the Buddha will also expound the wondrous Dharma fruition, and thus he now inquires about it.
