['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a19_6']	現行熏種即成中品。	現行熏種即成中品。	07b	Actual dharmas perfuming seeds then form the middling stage.
['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a20_2']	并有力能令本種子生後中品。	并有力能令本種子生後中品。	07b	And it has the power to cause the original seeds to produce subsequent middling stages.
['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a20_11']	下品即滅名為轉滅。	下品即滅名為轉滅。	07b	The inferior stage is then extinguished, called transformation and extinction.

['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a22_12']	中品生已下品不生。	中品生已下品不生。	07b	when the middling stage is produced, the inferior stage is not produced.

['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a26_6']	無別目故。	無別目故。	07b	because there is no other name for it,
['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a26_11']	違比量故。	違比量故。	07b	and because it contradicts inference.

['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a27_11']	但令本種生後中品。	但令本種生後中品。	07b	It only causes the original seeds to produce the middle grade later.

['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a29_3']	何名轉滅。	何名轉滅。	07b	how can it be called transformation and extinction?
['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808a29_12']	若以不生即名為滅。	若以不生即名為滅。	07b	If non-production is called extinction,
['ZH_T43_1832_07b:0808b01_3']	豈諸種子皆定生現。	豈諸種子皆定生現。	07b	how can it be that all seeds definitely produce the present?🔽In accordance with this principle, transformation and equality should be superior.
