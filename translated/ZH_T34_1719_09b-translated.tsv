Since the Way is in the teacher, the Way is revered. Since the teacher has the Way, the teacher is venerable. Since the teacher is venerable, the summons cannot be disobeyed. Since the Way is revered, if there is a summons, one must respond. Since the teacher possesses both, one must bow one's head and respectfully obey.

The present Buddha himself will benefit beings in the present. The bodhisattvas promoting the sūtra are in the future. The wisdom benefit being vast cannot be measured by the mind.

Now, wanting to reveal the origin, first revealing the past disciples, both the present and future have the wholesome roots increasing, therefore summoning the past disciples to manifest to the present people, causing the present people to give rise to present wholesome, causing the past disciples to promote the present sutra, causing the future people to give rise to future wholesome.

Deluded ones are confused by principle and obscure the roots and traces, so they cling to the recent traces and lose the distant root. The root and traces are still confused, let alone the inconceivable one. Therefore, the disciples of the root dwell below in the void, and the teacher of the root land has long been in the void. The teacher and disciples of the present are in the present void. The void of the past and the void of the present, the void below and the void above, although they are essentially one, the disciples of the root originally know the recent traces. The disciples of the present are still confused about the distant root. In order to break the clinging to the recent, the past is called to show the present. The disciples of the present give rise to doubts and make requests. Hearing the teaching will then break them. Breaking the clinging to the evil of the recent is called the counteractive.

The tranquil light bodhisattvas practice for a long time and are adorned, so the child is old.
['ZH_T34_1719_09b:0323c11_16']	譬「藥力」者，父何以少子何以老，準下父子譬意，父久先服種智還年之藥，父老而若少，子亦久稟常住不死之方，子少而若老，雖各有服餌之功，而父子久定。	譬「藥力」者，父何以少子何以老，準下父子譬意，父久先服種智還年之藥，父老而若少，子亦久稟常住不死之方，子少而若老，雖各有服餌之功，而父子久定。	As for the analogy of the power of medicine, why is the father young and the son old? Based on the meaning of the father and son analogy below, the father has long taken the medicine of the wisdom of the various teachings to return to youth, so the father is old but seems young. The son has also long received the method of the eternal and undying abodes, so the son is young but seems old. Although each has the merit of taking the medicine, the father and son have long been determined.

However, the text of the first aspect is in the present chapter, the second aspect is partially included in the following chapter, and the third and fourth aspects are used to explore the following chapter. They all assist the following to achieve revealing the distant, because seeing the original nature is good and breaking through evil.

['ZH_T34_1719_09b:0323c29_17']	二他方於此無臣益者，即無為人；	二他方於此無臣益者，即無為人；	Second, those from other directions have no benefit from this, which is not for the sake of people;

['ZH_T34_1719_09b:0324a06_15']	故以第二義顯初義云「結緣事淺」，初從此佛菩薩結緣，還於此佛菩薩成熟。	故以第二義顯初義云「結緣事淺」，初從此佛菩薩結緣，還於此佛菩薩成熟。	Therefore, the second meaning is used to reveal the first meaning, saying the matter of karmic affinity is shallow. Initially, one forms karmic affinity with this buddha or bodhisattva, and then matures under this buddha or bodhisattva.

The three meanings of calling those below are endowed with the four benefits. First, the child propagating the Dharma of the father has the benefit of the world. Next, because of the conditions below, the profound conditions and many benefits have the benefit of the person. Third, and obtaining below, because the doubts of the near are broken, there is the benefit of the counteractive. The distant basis is revealed, so there is the benefit of the ultimate truth. This is the benefit of calling the basis to propagate the sūtra.

Both the dependent and the basis have a body that is the dependent, and the basis that is the dependent is based on the dependent and the basis. The two meanings are equal, which is precisely the characteristic of the body and land of Mahāvairocana.

If one does not understand this one principle, who will understand that in the ten directions and Dharma realms there is only one Buddha, and also allows for other Buddhas?

Ultimate means the goal, the fruition that is aimed for. This is the stage that the bodhisattvas have partially reached, and it is called the ultimate stage.
['ZH_T34_1719_09b:0324a27_7']	又地裂者，地覆本屬如迹隱本，今開迹顯本故裂地表之。	又地裂者，地覆本屬如迹隱本，今開迹顯本故裂地表之。	Moreover, the earth splitting open means that the earth covers the original, like a trace concealing the original. Now, revealing the trace and manifesting the original causes the earth to split open and symbolize it.
['ZH_T34_1719_09b:0324b01_4']	然諸菩薩於此已前亦曾有迹，雖但顯本於理未彰，但弟子被覆義當覆師，弟子若顯師無不顯，故顯弟子義當顯師。	然諸菩薩於此已前亦曾有迹，雖但顯本於理未彰，但弟子被覆義當覆師，弟子若顯師無不顯，故顯弟子義當顯師。	However, the bodhisattvas had traces before this as well. Although it only manifests the original, it is not yet clear in principle. It only means that the disciples are covered, which is equivalent to the teacher being covered. If the disciples are revealed, the teacher is not unmanifest, so revealing the disciples is equivalent to revealing the teacher.

Because it abides in the sky, it does not belong to that realm. Using that to symbolize non-existence and this to symbolize existence, using the sky to symbolize the middle.

The original is not from a distant past, so the thousand petals form the traces within the traces. But the platform is compared to the thousand petals as the original. Even if the ten directions are mutually the primary and secondary, the ten directions are still not apart from a single dust mote. A single dust mote is only here on the platform and petals.

The Lotus Sūtra is the original teaching of the Huayan Sūtra. Although the Huayan Sūtra has the practice of the distant cause, it is only the cause of today's once-returner, and has not yet said that it is the fruit of the once-returner in the middle.

Now, the transformation means that the defiled is used to teach the provisional, and the transformation indicates the manifestation of the real. The defiled belongs to the five turbidities that originally exist in the small capacity. When the opportunity for the provisional is opened, the transformation of the land is used to indicate.

The person who advances has something to realize and is good. Maitreya does not know the inner goodness of them. Because his own goodness does not arise, there is no benefit for people. Although the position of advancing is deep, how can it surpass assisting the Buddha? Although it is said to be the end of learning, the position of being without defilements is accomplished. How can it be judged based on the former and later?

Maitreya did not know the true and provisional, and lacked the way to benefit beings, so he did not recognize the afflictions and had no antidotes.

These four virtues are neither before nor after, and according to the category of virtues, there is the function of the three periods of time.

Moreover, since the four are not four and the three are also not three, if one wants to briefly correspond the names and appearances of three and four, spiritual powers are the play of bodhisattvas, so they are called joy.

The next sentence says that because the body attains principle, it is different yet not different. Since life is numerous yet not numerous, the body is also divided yet has nothing to divide. Because the principle of reality is not measurable, it cannot be sought through numbers. The Dharma body is not a form, so it cannot be grasped through the body. Since the divided body takes the Dharma body as the body, the life span also takes eternal life as life. Therefore, it then cites Samantabhadra and Prabhūtaratna as examples.

Prabhūtaratna has been extinct for a long time, yet he appears to certify the sūtra, prefiguring that the extinction at the twin trees is also not extinction. Now, I say that using non-life to explain life, the principle is indeed so.

Maitreya asked about the bodhisattvas who emerged, from whom they aroused the mind, etc. He suspected that since the Buddha's enlightenment at Gayā was not long ago, how could the bodies of those he transformed have such inconceivable characteristics?
