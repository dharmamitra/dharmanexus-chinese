['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c04_1']	無別法故。	無別法故。	004	Because there is no separate dharma.

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c04_20']	無明所染有染心故。	無明所染有染心故。	004	Because the defiled mind is defiled by ignorance.

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c07_10']	若謂與心不相應故名無明者。	若謂與心不相應故名無明者。	004	If it is said that it is called ignorance because it is not in accord with the mind,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c08_1']	即前三染應是覺悟。	即前三染應是覺悟。	004	Then the first three defilements should be enlightenment,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c08_6']	言相應故。	言相應故。	004	Because they are in accord.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c08_15']	由是別有能迷無明。	由是別有能迷無明。	004	Therefore there is a separate ignorance that can delude.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c09_4']	雖不離真非即真體。	雖不離真非即真體。	004	Although it is not separate from the truth, it is not the essence of the truth.

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c11_2']	未有能所王數別故。	未有能所王數別故。	004	Because there is no distinction yet between the doer, the object, and the mental factors.

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c12_7']	故新論云。	故新論云。	004	Therefore the new treatise says:
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c12_17']	不覺一法界故不相應。	不覺一法界故不相應。	004	Because of not realizing the one dharma realm, it is not associated with [afflictions].
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c13_12']	無明分別起唯此能為諸染之源。	無明分別起唯此能為諸染之源。	004	The arising of discrimination due to ignorance is precisely what can serve as the source of all defilements.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c13_17']	更無染本。	更無染本。	004	There is no further defiled basis.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c14_11']	故言忽然念起　經說五住處。	故言忽然念起　經說五住處。	004	Therefore it is said that thought suddenly arises. The sutra speaks of five abodes.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c15_7']	前無更別法起故名無始無明住地。	前無更別法起故名無始無明住地。	004	Because there is no further dharma arising before this, it is called the ground of ignorance that abides from beginningless time.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c15_16']	顯無別法始無明者。	顯無別法始無明者。	004	It is made clear that there is no separate dharma that is the beginningless ignorance.

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c21_3']	有其六種。	有其六種。	004	As for saying that the defiled mind with defilements has six kinds,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c21_12']	即上意識及五種意。	即上意識及五種意。	004	it refers to the sixth consciousness and the five kinds of mental consciousness.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c21_19']	前明因緣起義。	前明因緣起義。	004	Previously, in explaining the meaning of arising from causes and conditions,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c22_9']	故從細向麁次第問說。	故從細向麁次第問說。	004	the questions were asked in order from subtle to coarse.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c22_18']	今欲兼顯治斷義故。	今欲兼顯治斷義故。	004	Now, in order to reveal the meaning of eliminating afflictions,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c23_8']	從麁至細次第而明。	從麁至細次第而明。	004	it is explained from coarse to subtle.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c23_17']	故雖前後而無別也。	故雖前後而無別也。	004	Therefore, although there is a sequence, there is no difference.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c24_1']	論。	論。	004	The treatise states:
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c24_13']	云何為六至遠離故　釋曰。	云何為六至遠離故　釋曰。	004	What are the six? Up to the meaning of being far removed. The commentary states:
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c24_18']	次釋六染。	次釋六染。	004	Next, the six defilements are explained.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c25_3']	即分為六。	即分為六。	004	They are divided into six.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c25_12']	此執相應即是意識。	此執相應即是意識。	004	This clinging association is precisely the sixth consciousness.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c26_10']	亦六麁中執取計名四相義中麁執著相。	亦六麁中執取計名四相義中麁執著相。	004	It is also the clinging and conceptualization among the six coarse [states] and the coarse clinging characteristics among the four characteristics.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c27_1']	見愛煩惱所增長故。	見愛煩惱所增長故。	004	Because it is nourished by the afflictions of views and attachments.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c27_15']	我我所等麁執相應望污淨心故。	我我所等麁執相應望污淨心故。	004	Because the coarse clinging characteristics of self, mine, etc. are associated with defiling the pure mind,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c28_2']	名執相應染。	名執相應染。	004	it is called the defilement of clinging association.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1138c28_11']	此即辨障下顯對治。	此即辨障下顯對治。	004	This then distinguishes the hindrances. Below, the counteragents are revealed.

Bodhisattvas who have entered the stage of the realization of faith are also free from this defilement.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a01_8']	名信相應。	名信相應。	004	They are called those who are in accord with faith.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a02_6']	故十地論及無著論皆說地前名信行地。	故十地論及無著論皆說地前名信行地。	004	Therefore the Dashabhumika-shastra and the Shastra of Asvabhava both say that the stage prior to the ten grounds is called the stage of practice in faith.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a03_1']	得人空門見愛煩惱不得現行。	得人空門見愛煩惱不得現行。	004	They attain the gate of emptiness of persons and the propensities of views and love are not able to be active.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a03_12']	故遠非約隨眠種未亡故。	故遠非約隨眠種未亡故。	004	Therefore they are far removed from them, but they have not yet eliminated the seeds of the propensities.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a04_2']	此位何不斷惑種耶。	此位何不斷惑種耶。	004	Why then do they not eliminate the seeds of the propensities?
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a04_5']	有義。	有義。	004	There is an interpretation.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a04_12']	地前道力劣故。	地前道力劣故。	004	Because the power of the path of the stage prior to the ten grounds is weak,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a04_17']	現惑當起。	現惑當起。	004	the propensities of views and love will arise again.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a05_1']	況能斷種。	況能斷種。	004	How much less could they eliminate the seeds?
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a05_10']	若至初地得無漏道。	若至初地得無漏道。	004	If one reaches the first ground and attains the path of pure discernment,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a05_19']	方斷分別煩惱障種。	方斷分別煩惱障種。	004	only then does one eliminate the seeds of the propensities of the obstacle of the passions that are eliminated by the path of insight.

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a08_6']	是故地前不斷惑種。	是故地前不斷惑種。	004	Therefore, prior to the ten grounds, one does not eliminate the seeds of the propensities.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a08_9']	有義。	有義。	004	There is an interpretation.

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a09_5']	但順法相大乘義故。	但順法相大乘義故。	004	However, in accordance with the characteristics of dharmas and the meaning of the Great Vehicle,
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a09_14']	信位菩薩能得佛身。	信位菩薩能得佛身。	004	it is said that bodhisattvas in the stage of faith can attain the Buddha's body,

['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a10_13']	亦能少分見生空理。	亦能少分見生空理。	004	They are also able to partially see the principle of emptiness of persons.
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a11_3']	如何不能斷惑種耶。	如何不能斷惑種耶。	004	How is it that they are unable to eliminate the seeds of afflictions?
['ZH_T85_2814_004:1139a11_12']	能起勝道永斷煩惱。	能起勝道永斷煩惱。	004	They are able to give rise to the superior path and permanently eliminate afflictions.
