['ZH_T39_1790_001:0426b11_9']	又就所證所得理果，不異諸聲聞故，唯立二藏。	又就所證所得理果，不異諸聲聞故，唯立二藏。	Moreover, in terms of the principle and fruit that are realized and attained, they are no different from the various śrāvakas, so only two treasuries are established.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0426b12_18']	又據教行少異聲聞藏，亦別立藏，如《普超三昧經》及入大乘論。	又據教行少異聲聞藏，亦別立藏，如《普超三昧經》及入大乘論。	Moreover, in terms of the teachings and practices that slightly differ from the śrāvaka treasury, a separate treasury is also established, as in the Samādhi-sūtra of Universal Surpassing and the Treatise on Entering the Great Vehicle.

['ZH_T39_1790_001:0426b19_16']	或具十二部攝，謂於大乘中自具十二故。	或具十二部攝，謂於大乘中自具十二故。	Or it may belong to all twelve divisions, because it itself contains the twelve in the Mahāyāna.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0426b22_2']	或十二所不攝，以小乘亦具十二，非攝此故，如《法華》云「受持十二部未足為難，信受此經是則為難。	或十二所不攝，以小乘亦具十二，非攝此故，如《法華》云「受持十二部未足為難，信受此經是則為難。	Or it may not be included in the twelve, because the Hīnayāna also has twelve divisions, which are not included here, as the Lotus Sūtra says, It is not difficult to uphold the twelve divisions, but to believe and accept this sūtra is difficult.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0426b23_18']	」或於大乘三藏十二總所不攝，以理超言外，故經云「言說別施行，真實離文字。	」或於大乘三藏十二總所不攝，以理超言外，故經云「言說別施行，真實離文字。	Or, it is not included in the three baskets and twelve divisions of the Mahayana, because the principle transcends verbal expression. Therefore, the sutra says, The separate practice of speech is truly apart from words.

['ZH_T39_1790_001:0426b28_12']	西方諸師所說差別，竝如《華嚴記》中說。	西方諸師所說差別，竝如《華嚴記》中說。	The differences explained by the Western masters are all as explained in the Flower Ornament Sutra Commentary.

['ZH_T39_1790_001:0429a19_9']	次六殊勝為無等行，以四尋思觀、六度、十地及三學等俱是正行故；	次六殊勝為無等行，以四尋思觀、六度、十地及三學等俱是正行故；	The next six kinds of supremacy are the unequalled practice, because the four kinds of thorough investigation, the six perfections, the ten grounds, the three learnings, etc., are all correct practices;

The three natures are based only on the eight consciousnesses. The establishment of the meaning of the eight consciousnesses only reveals the two emptinesses.

The nature is of a single flavor. Therefore, in these four meanings, if one contemplates and gives rise to faith in a single gate, one practices and attains the fruition.

Just as the ocean becomes waves, the cause follows the conditions of wind to produce waves of different sizes, yet the cause of difference cannot be found in the ocean, and yet it can give rise to differences according to conditions.

['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a03_15']	一、就執非有門，如小乘中隨於法執，總不說有大菩提性。	一、就執非有門，如小乘中隨於法執，總不說有大菩提性。	First, in terms of the gate of non-existence of grasping, like in the Hīnayāna, following the grasping of dharmas, it is not explained at all that there is a nature of great enlightenment.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a05_14']	二、隨事虧盈門，如《瑜伽》等中，但就法爾種子有為無漏為菩提性，是故不說普遍眾生。	二、隨事虧盈門，如《瑜伽》等中，但就法爾種子有為無漏為菩提性，是故不說普遍眾生。	Second, in terms of the gate of the deficiency and abundance of phenomena, like in the Yogācāra and other texts, it is only based on the seeds of dharmatā, conditioned and uncontaminated, as the nature of enlightenment. Therefore, it is not explained that it is universal to all sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a07_8']	三、約理遍情門，如此經及《涅槃》等，凡諸有心皆有佛性，是故眾生無非有心。	三、約理遍情門，如此經及《涅槃》等，凡諸有心皆有佛性，是故眾生無非有心。	Third, in terms of the gate of the pervasiveness of principle in sentient beings, like in this sūtra and the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, all those with minds have Buddha-nature. Therefore, there are none among sentient beings who do not have a mind.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a08_2']	有心無非有性，以心必有性。	有心無非有性，以心必有性。	Those with a mind are all those who have the nature, because the mind must have the nature.

['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a09_6']	若爾，何故前教定說有無佛性耶？	若爾，何故前教定說有無佛性耶？	If that is so, why did the previous teachings definitely explain the existence and non-existence of Buddha-nature?
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a11_4']	《佛性》、《寶性》二論自釋，為一闡提謗法罪重，依無量時故作是說，非謂究竟無清淨性。	《佛性》、《寶性》二論自釋，為一闡提謗法罪重，依無量時故作是說，非謂究竟無清淨性。	The two treatises, Buddha-nature and Jewel-nature, explain that it is said that the offenses of icchantikas who slander the Dharma are heavy and rely on immeasurable time, but this does not mean that they ultimately lack the pure nature.

['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a15_1']	二、就教者，《佛性論》第二卷末云「若一切眾生悉有佛性，何故如來經中說有一分無般涅槃眾生？	二、就教者，《佛性論》第二卷末云「若一切眾生悉有佛性，何故如來經中說有一分無般涅槃眾生？	Second, regarding the teachings, the second fascicle of the Buddha-Nature Treatise states: If all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature, why did the Tathāgata say in the sūtras that there is a portion of sentient beings who will not attain parinirvāṇa?

['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a17_19']	六、二乘迴心門者，有說：	六、二乘迴心門者，有說：	Sixth, the gate of the two vehicles turning the mind, some say:
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a18_18']	定性二乘定不迴心向大菩提，如《深密經》等。	定性二乘定不迴心向大菩提，如《深密經》等。	The two vehicles with fixed natures definitely do not turn their minds and head towards great enlightenment, as the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra and other texts explain.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a18_21']	有說：	有說：	Some say:
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a19_19']	一切二乘究竟悉皆得大菩提，如《法華》等。	一切二乘究竟悉皆得大菩提，如《法華》等。	All two vehicles ultimately all attain great enlightenment, as the Lotus Sūtra and other texts explain.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a20_9']	今會此二說，亦有二義：	今會此二說，亦有二義：	Now reconciling these two explanations, there are also two meanings:
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a20_15']	一法、二教。	一法、二教。	One is the Dharma, the other is the teaching.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a21_17']	法中，前經約就此生定入涅槃，必不迴心，故作是說。	法中，前經約就此生定入涅槃，必不迴心，故作是說。	In the Dharma, the previous sūtras are based on those who definitely enter nirvāṇa in this lifetime, and they definitely do not turn their minds, so they explain it in this way.
['ZH_T39_1790_001:0432a22_13']	後經縱入涅槃，後必當起趣大菩提。	後經縱入涅槃，後必當起趣大菩提。	The later sūtras allow that after entering nirvāṇa, they will later definitely arise and head towards great enlightenment.
