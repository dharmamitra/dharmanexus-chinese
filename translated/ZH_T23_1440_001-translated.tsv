In one kind of seed, if one breaks a grain of wheat or a grain of millet, cuts a root fruit, or picks a branch leaf, one commits a sin for each breakage or cutting.
['ZH_T23_1440_001:0507b08_11']	隨所得罪處，反罪得戒得爾所戒。	隨所得罪處，反罪得戒得爾所戒。	According to the place where one commits a sin, one receives the precepts and obtains the precepts.
