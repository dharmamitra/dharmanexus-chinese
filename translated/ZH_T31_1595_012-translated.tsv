['ZH_T31_1595_012:0238c22_5']	菩薩定與二乘定既有差別，定為慧依止，慧依定得成，菩薩慧與二乘慧亦應有差別。	菩薩定與二乘定既有差別，定為慧依止，慧依定得成，菩薩慧與二乘慧亦應有差別。	012	Since the concentration of bodhisattvas and the concentration of the two vehicles are already distinguished, since concentration is the basis for wisdom, and since wisdom is accomplished based on concentration, the wisdom of bodhisattvas and the wisdom of the two vehicles must also have distinctions.

['ZH_T31_1595_012:0238c24_6']	無分別智名依慧學，是無分別智差別應知即是依慧學差別。	無分別智名依慧學，是無分別智差別應知即是依慧學差別。	012	Non-discriminating cognition is called the training in wisdom. The distinctions in this non-discriminating cognition should be known as precisely the distinctions in the training in wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0238c24_15', 'ZH_T31_1595_012:0238c25_14']	此無分別智有三種：🔽一加行無分別智，謂尋思等智即是道因；	此無分別智有三種： 一加行無分別智，謂尋思等智即是道因；	012	This non-discriminating cognition is of three kinds:🔽First, the non-discriminating cognition of application, which refers to the cognition of investigation and so forth, which is precisely the cause of the path;
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0238c26_7']	二無分別智，即是道正體；	二無分別智，即是道正體；	012	Second, non-discriminating cognition, which is precisely the main body of the path;
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0238c27_3']	三無分別後智，即是出觀智，謂道果。	三無分別後智，即是出觀智，謂道果。	012	The third is the subsequent cognition without discrimination, which is the cognition after emerging from contemplation, namely the path and its fruits.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0238c27_13']	此三智悉是依慧學體。	此三智悉是依慧學體。	012	These three cognitions are all the essence of the training in wisdom.

Because he seeks the fruit of the future cognition without discrimination, the present expedient cognition becomes accomplished.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0239a01_10']	以是能依，故名依慧學。	以是能依，故名依慧學。	012	Because it is the support, it is called the training in wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0239a03_9']	又此方便智能引當來無分別智，無分別智起必依此方便得成，以是所依故名依慧學。	又此方便智能引當來無分別智，無分別智起必依此方便得成，以是所依故名依慧學。	012	Moreover, this expedient cognition can attract the future cognition without discrimination. The cognition without discrimination arises necessarily in dependence on this expedient cognition to become accomplished. Because it is the supported, it is called the training in wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0239a04_15']	道正體為依慧學者，謂依內起智在觀，離散動故名為內。	道正體為依慧學者，謂依內起智在觀，離散動故名為內。	012	The correct essence of the path is the training in wisdom, because the cognition that arises internally in dependence on contemplation is called internal because it is free from distraction and agitation.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0239a05_8']	此智依觀起，故名依慧學。	此智依觀起，故名依慧學。	012	This cognition arises in dependence on contemplation, and is therefore called the training in wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0239a06_16']	又有自體為內，因已謝、果未起，道體自相續，即說自體為內。	又有自體為內，因已謝、果未起，道體自相續，即說自體為內。	012	Moreover, having its own essence is internal, because the cause has already ceased and the effect has not yet arisen, and the essence of the path continues in a series. It is said that having its own essence is internal.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0239a07_8']	依自體起，故名依慧學。	依自體起，故名依慧學。	012	Because it arises based on one's own essence, it is called the training in wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1595_012:0239a08_11']	出觀智為依慧學者，依無分別智成此智，名依慧學。	出觀智為依慧學者，依無分別智成此智，名依慧學。	012	The wisdom that arises from emerging from concentration and takes the training in wisdom as its basis is the wisdom that is accomplished based on non-discriminating wisdom. It is called the training in wisdom.
