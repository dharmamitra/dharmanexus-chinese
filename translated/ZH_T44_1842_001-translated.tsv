['ZH_T44_1842_001:0163a25_18']	無此過者。	無此過者。	001	then there is no such fault.

['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c08_12']	答因言所作。	答因言所作。	001	The answer is that the reason states that what is produced

['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c09_5']	非離所作唯在餘法。	非離所作唯在餘法。	001	and is not apart from what is produced, but only in other dharmas.

['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c10_13']	雙顯因中作無常義。	雙顯因中作無常義。	001	both illustrate the meaning of impermanence in the reason.
['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c11_2']	以瓶之上有其所作。	以瓶之上有其所作。	001	Because on top of the vase there is what is produced,
['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c11_7']	即無常隨。	即無常隨。	001	impermanence follows.
['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c11_14']	故此因言所作。	故此因言所作。	001	Therefore, the reason states that what is produced

['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c12_9']	聲既即所作。	聲既即所作。	001	Since sound is precisely what is produced,
['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c12_15']	明無常亦隨。	明無常亦隨。	001	And the absence of permanence also follows.

['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c13_14']	故理門云。	故理門云。	001	Therefore, the Nyāyamukha says:
['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c14_7']	雖一切分皆能為因顯了所立。	雖一切分皆能為因顯了所立。	001	Although all parts can serve as reasons to clarify what is to be established,

['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c15_6']	但以初相顯因猶隱。	但以初相顯因猶隱。	001	It is only because the initial characteristic makes the reason still hidden
['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c15_15']	故約二品有無不同。	故約二品有無不同。	001	that it relies on the presence or absence of the two classes being different,
['ZH_T44_1842_001:0167c16_1']	及二品依。	及二品依。	001	and the basis of the two classes.
