It is shown that the Tathāgata is of the characteristic of permanence because he has attained Buddhahood.
['ZH_T31_1597_009:0371b22_15']	本願所引故者，謂昔發願常作一切有情利樂，所證佛身此願所引，由此本願非空無果，應知如來常住為相。	本願所引故者，謂昔發願常作一切有情利樂，所證佛身此願所引，由此本願非空無果，應知如來常住為相。	Because it is attracted by the original vow means that in the past he made the vow to always benefit and bring happiness to all sentient beings. The Buddha-body he has realized is attracted by this vow. For this reason, this original vow is not empty and without result. It should be known that the Tathāgata is of the characteristic of permanence.
['ZH_T31_1597_009:0371b24_10']	若謂如來所作一切有情利樂已究竟者，此義不然，所應作事無竟期故。	若謂如來所作一切有情利樂已究竟者，此義不然，所應作事無竟期故。	If it is said that the Tathāgata has already accomplished the task of benefiting and bringing happiness to all sentient beings, this is not so, because the task to be accomplished has no end.

Therefore they give rise to a superior joy.
