Sentient beings see that earth is truly earth and never say it is fire. Fire is truly fire and never say it is earth. Water, wind, form, sound, smell, taste, touch, clothing, food and drink, ornaments, utensils, music, light and darkness, men and women, houses, fields, work, suffering and happiness - suffering is truly suffering and never say it is happiness. Happiness is truly happiness and never say it is suffering.

All worlds from ancient times have transmitted these names and characteristics naturally known, not from cultivation and then knowing. This is called the true meaning of worldly dissemination.

['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968b16_6']	聲聞辟支佛分觀五陰，是故離陰都不見我及以我所；	聲聞辟支佛分觀五陰，是故離陰都不見我及以我所；	The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas analyze the five aggregates, and therefore apart from the aggregates they do not see a self or what belongs to a self;

This is called the pure wisdom that removes the obstructions to the true meaning.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968b18_13']	若智不能知境界者，名曰智障。	若智不能知境界者，名曰智障。	If wisdom cannot know the object, it is called the obstruction of wisdom.

This is called the pure wisdom that removes the obstructions;
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968b24_9']	觀諸法界不可宣說，知世諦故分別法界，知諸法界真實性故名無勝慧，無勝慧者壞一切障，是故名為淨智慧障真實義也。	觀諸法界不可宣說，知世諦故分別法界，知諸法界真實性故名無勝慧，無勝慧者壞一切障，是故名為淨智慧障真實義也。	Contemplating the dharma realm as inexpressible, knowing the conventional truth, therefore discriminating the dharma realm, and knowing the true nature of the dharma realm is called unsurpassed wisdom. The unsurpassed wisdom destroys all obstructions, and therefore it is called the pure wisdom that removes the obstructions to the true meaning.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968b24_18']	真實義者復有二種：	真實義者復有二種：	The true meaning is of two kinds:

This is called worldly existence.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c01_18']	世間有者所謂法性，無者世流布有。	世間有者所謂法性，無者世流布有。	Worldly existence refers to the nature of phenomena, and non-existence is worldly convention.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c03_4']	從色乃至涅槃，其性無故是名為無，眾生見故名之為有。	從色乃至涅槃，其性無故是名為無，眾生見故名之為有。	From form up to nirvana, its nature is non-existent, so it is called non-existence. Because sentient beings see it, it is called existence.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c04_8']	法性本無名之為無，諸佛如來所說有無，名之真實。	法性本無名之為無，諸佛如來所說有無，名之真實。	The nature of phenomena is originally non-existent, so it is called non-existence. The existence and non-existence spoken of by the Buddhas and Tathāgatas are called the truth.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c05_13']	真實者名為中道，非有非無名為中道，中道者名無上道。	真實者名為中道，非有非無名為中道，中道者名無上道。	The truth is called the middle way, neither existence nor non-existence is called the middle way, and the middle way is called the unsurpassed way.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c06_16']	如是中道，諸佛世尊除壞障礙，是故名之為一切智。	如是中道，諸佛世尊除壞障礙，是故名之為一切智。	Such a middle way is what the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, eliminate and destroy, and therefore it is called omniscience.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c08_4']	菩薩摩訶薩雖學如是中道，猶有障礙，是故不得為一切智。	菩薩摩訶薩雖學如是中道，猶有障礙，是故不得為一切智。	Although the Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas study such a middle way, they still have obstacles, and therefore they are not able to attain omniscience.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c09_6']	菩薩智慧為方便故，名阿耨多羅三藐三菩提因。	菩薩智慧為方便故，名阿耨多羅三藐三菩提因。	The wisdom of the Bodhisattva is called the cause of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi because it is skillful means.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c09_10']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c15_6']	菩薩摩訶薩雖不具足中道智慧，說生死相亦有亦無亦為流布無上佛法，雖在生死亦能了了知生死過患心無厭悔，如其不知生死過者則不能得壞煩惱結，若心厭者則不能得教化眾生護諸佛法疾得涅槃，若得涅槃則不能得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	菩薩摩訶薩雖不具足中道智慧，說生死相亦有亦無亦為流布無上佛法，雖在生死亦能了了知生死過患心無厭悔，如其不知生死過者則不能得壞煩惱結，若心厭者則不能得教化眾生護諸佛法疾得涅槃，若得涅槃則不能得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	Although the Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas do not fully possess the wisdom of the middle way, they say that the characteristics of saṃsāra are both existent and nonexistent, and they also disseminate the unsurpassed Buddha Dharma. Although they are in saṃsāra, they are still able to clearly understand the faults of saṃsāra and have no regrets in their minds. If they do not clearly understand the faults of saṃsāra, they will not be able to destroy the bonds of afflictions. If their minds are weary, they will not be able to teach and transform sentient beings, protect the Dharma of the Buddhas, and quickly attain nirvāṇa. If they attain nirvāṇa, they will not be able to attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c16_10']	若不教化諸眾生者，云何能得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提？	若不教化諸眾生者，云何能得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提？	If one does not teach and transform sentient beings, how can one attain supreme, perfect enlightenment?
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c17_17']	是故菩薩若在生死之中修菩提道，不畏涅槃、不求涅槃。	是故菩薩若在生死之中修菩提道，不畏涅槃、不求涅槃。	Therefore, if bodhisattvas are in the midst of saṃsāra cultivating the path to enlightenment, they do not fear nirvāṇa and do not seek nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c21_3']	菩薩若畏於涅槃者，則不能得具足莊嚴菩提之道，亦不能為無量眾生讚歎涅槃，於涅槃所不生信喜專念之心，是故菩薩於涅槃所不生怖畏。	菩薩若畏於涅槃者，則不能得具足莊嚴菩提之道，亦不能為無量眾生讚歎涅槃，於涅槃所不生信喜專念之心，是故菩薩於涅槃所不生怖畏。	If bodhisattvas fear nirvāṇa, then they will not be able to fully adorn the path to enlightenment, and they will also not be able to praise nirvāṇa for innumerable sentient beings. They will not give rise to a mind of faith, joy, and single-minded recollection regarding nirvāṇa. Therefore, bodhisattvas do not give rise to fear regarding nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c23_6']	若是菩薩求涅槃者即能得之，如其得者則不能成阿耨多羅三藐三菩提、以諸佛法教化眾生。	若是菩薩求涅槃者即能得之，如其得者則不能成阿耨多羅三藐三菩提、以諸佛法教化眾生。	If these bodhisattvas seek nirvāṇa, they will be able to attain it. If they attain it, then they will not be able to accomplish supreme, perfect enlightenment and teach and transform sentient beings with the teachings of the buddhas.

This is called the bodhisattvas' lack of skillful means.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c27_2']	若是菩薩能深觀察生死過患樂處其中，不畏涅槃、不求涅槃，是名菩薩有善方便。	若是菩薩能深觀察生死過患樂處其中，不畏涅槃、不求涅槃，是名菩薩有善方便。	If a bodhisattva is able to deeply contemplate the faults of birth and death and delights in abiding within them, not fearing nirvāṇa and not seeking nirvāṇa, this is called a bodhisattva having skillful means.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0968c29_6']	善方便者解第一義空，菩薩摩訶薩修集如是第一義空，名菩薩戒大方便也，為得如來無上智故。	善方便者解第一義空，菩薩摩訶薩修集如是第一義空，名菩薩戒大方便也，為得如來無上智故。	One with skillful means understands the emptiness of ultimate truth. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas cultivating and accumulating such emptiness of ultimate truth is called the great skillful means of the bodhisattva precepts, in order to attain the unsurpassed wisdom of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a02_14']	若有修集是菩薩戒得真實智，知見諸法無我我所知諸法性，是故於法心無所著，亦說世諦、第一義諦；	若有修集是菩薩戒得真實智，知見諸法無我我所知諸法性，是故於法心無所著，亦說世諦、第一義諦；	If there are those who cultivate and accumulate these bodhisattva precepts and attain true wisdom, they will know and see that all dharmas are without self or what belongs to self, and will know the nature of all dharmas. Therefore, their minds are unattached to the Dharma, and they also explain the conventional truth and the ultimate truth;
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a04_15']	見一切法其心平等，能大惠施，以施因緣善知世事，雖學世事心不厭悔，悉得了知得大念力。	見一切法其心平等，能大惠施，以施因緣善知世事，雖學世事心不厭悔，悉得了知得大念力。	Seeing all dharmas, their minds are impartial, and they are able to give great generosity. Due to the causes and conditions of giving, they skillfully understand worldly affairs. Although they study worldly affairs, their minds are without regret, and they fully understand and attain great mindfulness.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a07_6']	雖知世事心無憍慢，常教眾生不生慳悋，以巧方便善教眾生世間之事，為令眾生得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提故。	雖知世事心無憍慢，常教眾生不生慳悋，以巧方便善教眾生世間之事，為令眾生得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提故。	Although they understand worldly affairs, their minds are without arrogance. They always teach sentient beings not to give rise to stinginess, and with skillful means they skillfully teach sentient beings worldly affairs, in order to enable sentient beings to attain supreme, perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a08_5']	菩薩於是世間之事，勤心修集無有厭悔。	菩薩於是世間之事，勤心修集無有厭悔。	Bodhisattvas diligently cultivate and accumulate these worldly affairs without weariness or regret.

['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a10_14']	菩薩如是增長善法不生憍慢，於諸眾生生憐愛心。	菩薩如是增長善法不生憍慢，於諸眾生生憐愛心。	Bodhisattvas thus increase wholesome dharmas without giving rise to arrogance, and they give rise to a mind of compassion for all sentient beings.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a11_17']	菩薩如是增長智慧不生憍慢，破壞眾生種種邪見。	菩薩如是增長智慧不生憍慢，破壞眾生種種邪見。	Bodhisattvas thus increase wisdom without giving rise to arrogance, and they destroy the various wrong views of sentient beings.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a13_11']	菩薩若得世間三昧出世三昧，不顯己德令他供養，不為世法之所污染。	菩薩若得世間三昧出世三昧，不顯己德令他供養，不為世法之所污染。	If bodhisattvas attain worldly samādhis and supramundane samādhis, they do not display their own virtues to receive offerings from others, and they are not defiled by worldly dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a14_10']	菩薩爾時成就具足無量功德，名菩薩戒。	菩薩爾時成就具足無量功德，名菩薩戒。	At that time, bodhisattvas accomplish and perfect immeasurable merits, which is called the bodhisattva precepts.

['ZH_T30_1582_002:0969a19_13']	菩薩摩訶薩受持三世諸菩薩法，能以佛法教化眾生，至心修行菩提之道，為菩提道不惜身命。	菩薩摩訶薩受持三世諸菩薩法，能以佛法教化眾生，至心修行菩提之道，為菩提道不惜身命。	Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas uphold the dharmas of the bodhisattvas of the three times and are able to teach sentient beings with the Buddha Dharma, practicing the path of bodhi with utmost sincerity, not sparing their lives for the path of bodhi.
