['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a09_5']	如來雖說第二義門，今觀世間解結之人，若不知其所結之元，我信是人終不能解。	如來雖說第二義門，今觀世間解結之人，若不知其所結之元，我信是人終不能解。	05a	Although the Tathāgata has explained the second principle, now observing the person in the world who unties knots, if he does not know the origin of the knots, I believe this person will never be able to untie them.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a10_8']	」前疑因果同異，今疑根塵結解，故云第二義門。	」前疑因果同異，今疑根塵結解，故云第二義門。	05a	Previously he doubted the sameness and difference of cause and effect, now he doubts the unravelling and binding of the faculties and objects, thus he says the second principle.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a13_2']	然根起之由前雖廣示，而不的指何處為結，結解之義尚未辨明，欲期指陳，皎然可識，故引前文佛所舉喻，以況己迷也。	然根起之由前雖廣示，而不的指何處為結，結解之義尚未辨明，欲期指陳，皎然可識，故引前文佛所舉喻，以況己迷也。	05a	However, although the reason for the arising of the faculties was extensively shown before, he did not specifically point out where the binding is, and the meaning of the unravelling of the binding has not yet been clarified. He wishes to point it out, so that it can be clearly recognized, thus he uses the analogy given by the Buddha in the previous text to illustrate his own confusion.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a14_3']	「世尊！	「世尊！	05a	World-Honored One!
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a16_9']	我及會中有學聲聞亦復如是，從無始際與諸無明俱滅俱生，雖得如是多聞善根，名為出家，猶隔日瘧。	我及會中有學聲聞亦復如是，從無始際與諸無明俱滅俱生，雖得如是多聞善根，名為出家，猶隔日瘧。	05a	I and the learners in the assembly are also like this. From beginningless time, we have been simultaneously extinguished and simultaneously born with all ignorance. Although we have attained such wholesome roots of much learning and are called renunciants, we are still like a malaria patient with a two-day fever.

Therefore, the above text says, Falsely born through combination, falsely dying through combination. Therefore, it is said to be simultaneously extinguished and simultaneously born.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a21_14']	初果有學雖未斷思，已名破煩惱障，得人空證，而全未破所知障，法執猶存，故云猶隔日瘧。	初果有學雖未斷思，已名破煩惱障，得人空證，而全未破所知障，法執猶存，故云猶隔日瘧。	05a	Although the learners of the first fruit have not yet eliminated the thoughts, they are already called the destruction of the obstacle of afflictions and have attained the realization of emptiness of persons, but they have not yet completely eliminated the obstacle of the knowable, and the attachment to dharmas still remains. Therefore, it is said to be like a malaria patient with a two-day fever.

['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a27_7']	無始生死不能超越，蓋由結縛。	無始生死不能超越，蓋由結縛。	05a	They were unable to transcend birth and death since beginningless time, all due to bondage.

['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891a29_8']	一、世尊摩頂。	一、世尊摩頂。	05a	First, the World-Honored One touches the crown of the head.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b03_10']	爾時，世尊憐慜阿難及諸會中諸有學者，亦為未來一切眾生，為出世因、作將來眼，以閻浮檀紫金光手摩阿難頂。	爾時，世尊憐慜阿難及諸會中諸有學者，亦為未來一切眾生，為出世因、作將來眼，以閻浮檀紫金光手摩阿難頂。	05a	At that time, the World-Honored One, out of compassion for Ānanda and all those in the assembly who were still learning, and also for the sake of all sentient beings in the future, to provide the cause for transcending the world and to serve as the eyes for the future, used his hand, which emitted the purple-gold light of the Jambū River, to touch the crown of Ānanda's head.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b05_6']	頂是諸根之總，手為解結之要，摩而警動，將有解期，拊而安慰，令知深旨。	頂是諸根之總，手為解結之要，摩而警動，將有解期，拊而安慰，令知深旨。	05a	The crown of the head is the general of all the faculties, and the hand is the essential for unbinding. Touching and stirring it, there will be a time of unbinding; patting and comforting, causing them to know the profound meaning.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b05_13']	二、諸佛放光。	二、諸佛放光。	05a	Second, the buddhas emit light.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b09_1']	即時，十方普佛世界六種震動，微塵如來住世界者，各有寶光從其頂出，其光同時於彼世界來祇陀林，灌如來頂，是諸大眾得未曾有。	即時，十方普佛世界六種震動，微塵如來住世界者，各有寶光從其頂出，其光同時於彼世界來祇陀林，灌如來頂，是諸大眾得未曾有。	05a	At that moment, the worlds of the buddhas in the ten directions shook in six ways. The tathāgatas dwelling in the worlds each had a jeweled light emerge from their crowns. The lights simultaneously came from those worlds to Jetavana, pouring down on the tathāgata's crown. The great assembly attained what they had never had before.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b10_1']	無明住地為六情根，震動不安，因茲解結。	無明住地為六情根，震動不安，因茲解結。	05a	The ground of nescience is the six sense faculties. Shaking and unsettling, this leads to unravelling the knots.

['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b13_16']	此經從前至此四度放光，獨有今文諸佛同放，仍又同說，斯何特異乎？	此經從前至此四度放光，獨有今文諸佛同放，仍又同說，斯何特異乎？	05a	This sūtra has had light emitted four times up to this point. Only in this passage do the buddhas emit light together, and they also speak the same. What is so special about this?
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b13_18']	答：	答：	05a	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b15_5']	初為說教破邪，次為揀妄顯理，次為定見生智，今為入觀成行。	初為說教破邪，次為揀妄顯理，次為定見生智，今為入觀成行。	05a	The first is to explain the teaching and break with wrong views. The second is to distinguish delusion and reveal truth. The third is to determine views and give rise to wisdom. The present is to enter contemplation and perfect practice.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b15_17']	前三依教發解，未能除障；	前三依教發解，未能除障；	05a	The first three [parts] rely on the teachings to give rise to understanding, but are not yet able to eliminate hindrances;
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b17_8']	今文觀成破惑，正動無明，入法界理，故諸佛放光，同示解結體無二源。	今文觀成破惑，正動無明，入法界理，故諸佛放光，同示解結體無二源。	05a	In this text, the contemplation is perfected and breaks through delusions, directly agitating the fundamental ignorance and entering the principle of the Dharma realm. Therefore, the buddhas emit light, demonstrating together that the essence of unravelling the knots is not two sources.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b19_6']	故知說教破邪，顯真揀妄，立信成解，皆為今日成行取證，非聊爾事，故與前文異耳。	故知說教破邪，顯真揀妄，立信成解，皆為今日成行取證，非聊爾事，故與前文異耳。	05a	Therefore, know that expounding the teachings, breaking through delusions, revealing the true, distinguishing the false, establishing faith, and perfecting understanding, are all for today's practice and attainment of realization. It is not a trivial matter, so it is different from the previous text.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b19_13']	三、同說結根。	三、同說結根。	05a	Third, the same explanation of the root of the knots.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b21_7']	於是阿難及諸大眾俱聞十方微塵如來異口同音告阿難言：	於是阿難及諸大眾俱聞十方微塵如來異口同音告阿難言：	05a	Then, Ānanda and the great assembly all heard the tathāgatas in the ten directions with different mouths speaking the same words, addressing Ānanda, saying:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b21_13']	「善哉阿難！	「善哉阿難！	05a	Excellent, Ānanda!
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b23_1']	汝欲識知俱生無明，使汝輪轉生死結根，唯汝六根，更無他物。	汝欲識知俱生無明，使汝輪轉生死結根，唯汝六根，更無他物。	05a	If you wish to know the innate ignorance that causes you to revolve in birth and death, the root of the knots, it is none other than your six sense faculties.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b24_14']	汝復欲知無上菩提，令汝速證安樂解脫、寂靜妙常，亦汝六根，更非他物。	汝復欲知無上菩提，令汝速證安樂解脫、寂靜妙常，亦汝六根，更非他物。	05a	If you wish to know the unsurpassed bodhi that will enable you to quickly realize blissful liberation and the wondrous permanence of tranquility, it is also none other than your six sense faculties.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891b27_5']	」覺明初起，能所妄生，湛性既分，六根成異，根塵偶對，業性即生，輪轉無窮，生死長縛，斯六根為生死結縛之源也。	」覺明初起，能所妄生，湛性既分，六根成異，根塵偶對，業性即生，輪轉無窮，生死長縛，斯六根為生死結縛之源也。	05a	When the enlightened mind first arises, the deluded subject and object are born. Once the tranquil nature is divided, the six sense faculties become distinct. When the sense faculties and objects pair up, the nature of karma arises, and one revolves without end, long bound to birth and death. These six sense faculties are the source of the bondage of birth and death.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c01_1']	一念無念，能所都亡，根塵識心應時消落，無真可得、無妄可除，覺性圓明，法眼清淨，斯六根為自在解脫安樂妙常之源也。	一念無念，能所都亡，根塵識心應時消落，無真可得、無妄可除，覺性圓明，法眼清淨，斯六根為自在解脫安樂妙常之源也。	05a	If there is no thought in a single moment, the deluded subject and object completely vanish. The sense faculties, objects, and consciousnesses are instantly eliminated. There is no true nature to attain and no delusion to remove. The enlightened nature is perfectly clear, and the Dharma eye is pure. These six sense faculties are the source of self-mastery, liberation, bliss, and the wondrous permanence.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c02_10']	其猶氷水由氣之動移，相雖變異，濕性常一，結解同貫亦復爾也。	其猶氷水由氣之動移，相雖變異，濕性常一，結解同貫亦復爾也。	05a	It is just like ice and water, which change due to the movement of qi. Although their appearances differ, their wet nature is always the same. The same is true for the continuity of bondage and liberation.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c02_17']	四、阿難再請。	四、阿難再請。	05a	Fourth, Ānanda requests again.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c03_18']	阿難雖聞如是法音，心猶未明，稽首白佛：	阿難雖聞如是法音，心猶未明，稽首白佛：	05a	Although Ānanda has heard such Dharma sounds, his mind is still unclear. He bows his head and says to the Buddha:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c05_2']	「云何令我生死輪迴、安樂妙常，同是六根，更非他物？	「云何令我生死輪迴、安樂妙常，同是六根，更非他物？	05a	How can you say that my birth and death, samsara, bliss, and the wondrous permanence are all the same as the six sense faculties, and not something else?
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c06_15']	」染淨根本唯此六根，更無別法，於此起見生死輪迴，於此忘情涅槃常樂。	」染淨根本唯此六根，更無別法，於此起見生死輪迴，於此忘情涅槃常樂。	05a	The fundamental of defilement and purity is only these six faculties, there is no other dharma. If one gives rise to views in regard to them, one wanders in the cycle of birth and death; if one forgets attachment in regard to them, one attains the constant bliss of nirvana.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c07_6']	法執未破，孰能洞明？	法執未破，孰能洞明？	05a	Without breaking through the grasping of dharmas, who can thoroughly understand this?
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c07_16']	故再咨詢，欲期開示。	故再咨詢，欲期開示。	05a	Therefore, [the Buddha] is again asked to give instruction, hoping for revelation.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c08_4']	五、佛為釋通，二：	五、佛為釋通，二：	05a	Fifth, the Buddha's explanation, in two parts:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c08_11']	一、長行，二：	一、長行，二：	05a	First, the prose section, in two parts:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c08_16']	一、雙標。	一、雙標。	05a	First, a double indication.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c09_4']	佛告阿難：	佛告阿難：	05a	The Buddha told Ānanda:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c10_3']	「根塵同源，縛脫無二，識性虛妄，猶如空華。	「根塵同源，縛脫無二，識性虛妄，猶如空華。	05a	The faculties and sense objects have the same source, bondage and liberation are non-dual, the nature of consciousness is false, like a flower in the sky.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c11_3']	」根、境、識三無別體性，唯一真覺，故曰同源。	」根、境、識三無別體性，唯一真覺，故曰同源。	05a	The three of faculties, objects, and consciousness have no separate essence, they are only the one true enlightenment, therefore it is said they have the same source.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c12_16']	執見不亡，妄生取著，強分染淨，橫計身心，從始洎終念念生滅，故云為縛。	執見不亡，妄生取著，強分染淨，橫計身心，從始洎終念念生滅，故云為縛。	05a	If one clings to views and does not let go, falsely giving rise to grasping and attachment, forcefully dividing into pure and defiled, horizontally calculating body and mind, from beginning to end, thought after thought, arising and ceasing, therefore it is said to be bondage.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c14_18']	了相無相，分別不生，能所寂然，念想虛盡，一法無取，一真體現，心與虛空等無差別，故名為脫。	了相無相，分別不生，能所寂然，念想虛盡，一法無取，一真體現，心與虛空等無差別，故名為脫。	05a	Understanding that appearances are devoid of characteristics, discrimination does not arise. Subject and object are tranquil, and thoughts and memories are completely exhausted. Not grasping at a single dharma, the essence of the one true reality manifests. The mind is equal to space, without distinction. Therefore, it is called liberation.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c18_6']	識性虛妄猶如空華者，與上根、塵綺互相影，上言根塵影此識性，今言識性影前根塵，故三同源，亦同虛妄，故前文云「見與見緣并所想相，如虛空華。	識性虛妄猶如空華者，與上根、塵綺互相影，上言根塵影此識性，今言識性影前根塵，故三同源，亦同虛妄，故前文云「見與見緣并所想相，如虛空華。	05a	As for the nature of consciousness being false and illusory, like empty flowers, it is a mutual reflection of the faculties and objects. Above it says the faculties and objects reflect this nature of consciousness, and now it says the nature of consciousness reflects the faculties and objects. Therefore, the three have the same source and are also the same in being false and illusory. Therefore, the previous text says, The seer, the seen, and the conceptualized characteristics are like flowers in the sky.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c18_15']	」即此識性虛妄也。	」即此識性虛妄也。	05a	This is the false and illusory nature of consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c19_10']	又云「此見及緣，元是菩提妙淨明體。	又云「此見及緣，元是菩提妙淨明體。	05a	It also says, This seeing and its objects are originally the wondrous, pure, and bright essence of bodhi.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c19_19']	」即此根塵同源也。	」即此根塵同源也。	05a	This is the same source of the faculties and objects.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c20_6']	二、雙釋，二：	二、雙釋，二：	05a	Second, the double explanation, in two parts:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c20_13']	一、總顯無性。	一、總顯無性。	05a	First, generally revealing the lack of nature.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c21_3']	「阿難！	「阿難！	05a	Ānanda!
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c22_1']	由塵發知，因根有相，相見無性同於交蘆。	由塵發知，因根有相，相見無性同於交蘆。	05a	The knowledge that arises due to objects and the characteristics that exist due to the faculties are without any nature of their own, like two reeds supporting each other.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c23_1']	」攬塵成根，對根有相，根境立矣，妄識生焉。	」攬塵成根，對根有相，根境立矣，妄識生焉。	05a	The six sense organs are formed by grasping at sense objects, and in response to the sense organs, there are sense objects. Once the sense organs and sense objects are established, deluded consciousness arises.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c24_14']	妄識能變根境二法，故根境識互相假藉，一一體空、一一成立，故若交蘆。	妄識能變根境二法，故根境識互相假藉，一一體空、一一成立，故若交蘆。	05a	The deluded consciousness is able to transform the two dharmas of sense organs and sense objects. Therefore, the sense organs, sense objects, and consciousness mutually rely on each other. Each is empty in essence, yet each is established. Therefore, they are like two bundles of reeds supporting each other.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c25_1']	二、別明縛脫。	二、別明縛脫。	05a	Second, specifically clarifying bondage and liberation.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c26_14']	「是故汝今知見立知，即無明本；	「是故汝今知見立知，即無明本；	05a	Therefore, you should now know that if knowing and seeing establish knowing, it is the basis of ignorance;
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c27_16']	知見無見，斯即涅槃無漏真淨，云何是中更容他物？	知見無見，斯即涅槃無漏真淨，云何是中更容他物？	05a	If knowing and seeing are without seeing, this is nirvana, the pure true nature without outflows. How can there be any other thing within this?
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c28_4']	」由阿難再問：	」由阿難再問：	05a	Because Ananda asked again:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0891c29_7']	云何令我生死輪迴、安樂妙常同是六根，更非他物？	云何令我生死輪迴、安樂妙常同是六根，更非他物？	05a	How can you say that the cycle of birth and death and the wonderful permanence of bliss are all the six sense organs, and nothing else?
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892a02_17']	故佛先示根境識三唯一虛妄，同一性源，迷縛解脫誠非異轍，由此別示結答，令無所疑，因解成觀，妙果可冀。	故佛先示根境識三唯一虛妄，同一性源，迷縛解脫誠非異轍，由此別示結答，令無所疑，因解成觀，妙果可冀。	05a	Therefore, the Buddha first showed that the three of sense organs, sense objects, and consciousness are only one false illusion, with the same source of nature.

There is only the perfect and pure precious awareness. This is where the six sense faculties are the originally pure and clean essence of bodhi and nirvana.

Unconditioned phenomena have no arising or ceasing, and are unreal, like a flower in the sky.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b03_8']	」此文正破無明法執，執為、無為有實體者，皆迷真性。	」此文正破無明法執，執為、無為有實體者，皆迷真性。	05a	This text directly refutes the ignorance of the dharma-nature, and those who cling to the existence or non-existence of real substance are all deluded about the true nature.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b04_11']	一真法界本非對待，故此雙破，即是解結之所因也。	一真法界本非對待，故此雙破，即是解結之所因也。	05a	The one true dharma realm is originally not dualistic, therefore this refutes both, which is the cause for unravelling the knots.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b06_4']	此中四句，前二句破有為，後二句破無為，此二不立，方顯法界一相義耳。	此中四句，前二句破有為，後二句破無為，此二不立，方顯法界一相義耳。	05a	Here, the four statements, the first two refute the conditioned, and the last two refute the unconditioned. Only when these two are not established can the meaning of the one characteristic of the dharma realm be revealed.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b08_8']	言真性有為空者，真性之言正是標宗揀法，通下第二量轉，謂一真中道第一義諦也，應立量云：	言真性有為空者，真性之言正是標宗揀法，通下第二量轉，謂一真中道第一義諦也，應立量云：	05a	As for the statement the true nature of the conditioned is empty, the word true nature is precisely the main point of the argument, distinguishing the dharma, and extends to the second inference below, referring to the one true middle way of ultimate truth. The inference should be stated as follows:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b09_7']	真性有為元空不有，從緣生故，猶如幻事；	真性有為元空不有，從緣生故，猶如幻事；	05a	The true nature of the conditioned is originally empty and non-existent, because it arises from conditions, just like an illusion;
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b10_6']	真性無為本來不實，無起滅故，猶如空華。	真性無為本來不實，無起滅故，猶如空華。	05a	The true nature of the unconditioned is originally unreal, because it has no arising or ceasing, just like a flower in the sky.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b11_15']	由此二量三支無闕，標揀分明，無諸過非，《掌珍論》中取為善立。	由此二量三支無闕，標揀分明，無諸過非，《掌珍論》中取為善立。	05a	Because of these two inferences, the three parts are not lacking, the main point is clearly distinguished, and there are no faults. In the Treatise on the Precious Hand, this is taken as a good establishment.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b12_13']	第二量中先因後宗，譯人語便，亦無所失。	第二量中先因後宗，譯人語便，亦無所失。	05a	In the second inference, the reason comes first and the thesis comes later. The translator's wording is convenient, and there is no loss.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b15_18']	此義所顯一真平等，無諸對待，真妄染淨、生死涅槃、凡夫諸佛，皆如空華亂起亂滅，故下文云「一切世界山河大地、生死涅槃，皆即狂勞顛倒華相。	此義所顯一真平等，無諸對待，真妄染淨、生死涅槃、凡夫諸佛，皆如空華亂起亂滅，故下文云「一切世界山河大地、生死涅槃，皆即狂勞顛倒華相。	05a	The meaning revealed here is the one true equality, free from all opposites. Delusion, truth, defilement, purity, birth and death, nirvana, ordinary beings and buddhas are all like illusory flowers, arising and ceasing in confusion. Therefore, the text below says, All worlds, mountains, rivers, earth, birth and death, and nirvana are all illusory appearances of madness, labor, and delusion.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b17_7']	」故《中論》云「若法為待成，是法還成待，今則無因待，亦無所成法。	」故《中論》云「若法為待成，是法還成待，今則無因待，亦無所成法。	05a	Therefore, the Zhong lun says, If a dharma is established through dependence, this dharma still depends on being established. Now there is no dependence and no dharma to be established.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b18_17']	」斯顯第一義中離一切相，言語道斷，心行處滅，無明法執於斯盡矣。	」斯顯第一義中離一切相，言語道斷，心行處滅，無明法執於斯盡矣。	05a	This shows that in the ultimate truth, all characteristics are left behind, speech is cut off, and the mind is extinguished. The grasping of dharmas due to ignorance is exhausted here.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b19_4']	二、顯過況破。	二、顯過況破。	05a	Second, revealing the faults and using them to refute.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b21_3']	「言妄顯諸真，妄真同二妄，猶非真非真，云何見所見。	「言妄顯諸真，妄真同二妄，猶非真非真，云何見所見。	05a	Delusion is spoken of to reveal the true, but delusion and truth are both delusions. Even non-true and non-false are not true. How can the seen and the seer be seen?
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b22_2']	」初二句重顯前過，有為、無為是對待故。	」初二句重顯前過，有為、無為是對待故。	05a	The first two lines reiterate the previous mistake, because the conditioned and unconditioned are mutually dependent.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b22_16']	亦是破執，真性是有還同虛妄。	亦是破執，真性是有還同虛妄。	05a	This is also refuting attachment, because if the true nature exists, it is the same as false.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b23_1']	惑者議云：	惑者議云：	05a	Deluded people argue:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b24_17']	真性之中雖亡有為、無為，而此真性應有所得，是佛所證，離諸偽妄，故名曰真。	真性之中雖亡有為、無為，而此真性應有所得，是佛所證，離諸偽妄，故名曰真。	05a	Although the conditioned and unconditioned are absent within the true nature, this true nature should be something that can be attained. It is what the Buddha realized, free from all falsity, and is therefore called 'true.'
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b25_6']	是諸法性，畢竟應有。	是諸法性，畢竟應有。	05a	The nature of all dharmas should ultimately exist.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b25_11']	故此破云：	故此破云：	05a	Therefore, this refutes:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b27_1']	若言離妄所顯有真性者，還同妄法，俱為妄也，以是遍計所緣境故。	若言離妄所顯有真性者，還同妄法，俱為妄也，以是遍計所緣境故。	05a	If it is said that there is a true nature revealed by being free from falsity, it is the same as false dharmas, and both are false, because they are the objects of the imagination.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892b28_9']	離妄之真還因妄顯，如前文云「菩提心生，生滅心滅，此亦生滅。	離妄之真還因妄顯，如前文云「菩提心生，生滅心滅，此亦生滅。	05a	The truth that is free from falsity is revealed by falsity. As the previous text says: When the mind of enlightenment arises, the mind of birth and cessation ceases. This is also birth and cessation.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c02_6']	」《起信》亦云「言真如者亦無有相，謂言說之極，因言遣言，此真如體無有可遣，以一切法悉皆真故，亦無可立，以一切法皆同如故。	」《起信》亦云「言真如者亦無有相，謂言說之極，因言遣言，此真如體無有可遣，以一切法悉皆真故，亦無可立，以一切法皆同如故。	05a	The Awakening of Faith also says, As for the term 'suchness,' it also has no characteristics. It is the ultimate of speech, using words to eliminate words. This essence of suchness has nothing to be eliminated, because all dharmas are completely true. There is also nothing to be established, because all dharmas are the same as suchness.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c03_4']	當知一切法不可說不可念，故名真如。	當知一切法不可說不可念，故名真如。	05a	One should know that all dharmas are inexpressible and inconceivable, and are therefore called 'suchness.'
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c04_10']	」應知若有真性為所得者，皆為妄矣，故云妄真同二妄也。	」應知若有真性為所得者，皆為妄矣，故云妄真同二妄也。	05a	 One should know that if there is a true nature that can be attained, it is all false, and therefore it is said that the false and the true are both false.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c06_1']	猶非下二句況破執妄，初句躡前所非，尚無真與不真，不真即妄也。	猶非下二句況破執妄，初句躡前所非，尚無真與不真，不真即妄也。	05a	The two phrases below still not further refute the attachment to falsity. The first phrase continues the previous refutation, saying that there is still no true or not true, and not true is false.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c07_10']	次句正況，云何更存能見所見，根之與識俱名為見，所見即境也。	次句正況，云何更存能見所見，根之與識俱名為見，所見即境也。	05a	The next phrase is the actual refutation, saying, How can there still be the seer and the seen? The faculties and consciousnesses are both called seeing, and the seen is the object.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c09_1']	斯則總破真妄二心，諸對待法皆無所有，方名顯淨法界一真平等。	斯則總破真妄二心，諸對待法皆無所有，方名顯淨法界一真平等。	05a	This completely refutes the two minds of true and false, and all opposed and dependent dharmas are all nonexistent, and is then called the manifestation of the pure dharma realm, the one true equality.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c09_16']	此上二頌，正是頌前根塵同源也。	此上二頌，正是頌前根塵同源也。	05a	The two verses above are precisely the praise of the previous statement that the faculties and objects have the same source.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c10_14']	本源自性尚非真妄，豈得存乎根境識耶！	本源自性尚非真妄，豈得存乎根境識耶！	05a	The original nature is still not true or false, how could it be possible to have faculties, objects, and consciousness?
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c11_4']	故根境識同此一源。	故根境識同此一源。	05a	Therefore, the faculties, objects, and consciousnesses have this same source.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c11_13']	二、兩頌結解同體。	二、兩頌結解同體。	05a	Second, two verses conclude that bondage and liberation have the same essence.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c12_12']	「中間無實性，是故若交蘆。	「中間無實性，是故若交蘆。	05a	In the middle, there is no real nature, therefore it is like intertwined reeds.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c13_9']	」頌前根、塵相發，相見無性，猶如交蘆。	」頌前根、塵相發，相見無性，猶如交蘆。	05a	This praises the previous statement that the faculties and objects give rise to each other, and the seeing and seen have no nature, like intertwined reeds.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c14_12']	「結解同所因，聖凡無二路。	「結解同所因，聖凡無二路。	05a	Bondage and liberation have the same cause, sages and ordinary beings have no two paths.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c15_1']	」頌前縛脫無二也。	」頌前縛脫無二也。	05a	This praises the previous statement that bondage and liberation are not two.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c15_19']	六道凡夫業惑所繫不得自在，故名為縛。	六道凡夫業惑所繫不得自在，故名為縛。	05a	The six destinies of ordinary beings are bound by karma and afflictions and are not free, therefore they are called bound.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c16_17']	三乘賢聖斷惑證理不隨業繫，故名為解。	三乘賢聖斷惑證理不隨業繫，故名為解。	05a	The sages of the three vehicles cut off afflictions and realize the truth, and do not follow the bonds of karma, therefore they are called liberated.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c17_19']	此則皆由六根迷悟所致，更非別岐，故無二路。	此則皆由六根迷悟所致，更非別岐，故無二路。	05a	This is all due to the faculties being deluded or enlightened, and there is no other fork in the road, therefore there are no two paths.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c18_12']	「汝觀交中性，空有二俱非。	「汝觀交中性，空有二俱非。	05a	You observe the nature in the middle, emptiness and existence are both not.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c19_15']	」交中無性，將何遣有而更存無，一性之中無對待故。	」交中無性，將何遣有而更存無，一性之中無對待故。	05a	Since there is no nature in the middle of the intersection, what existence is there to be refuted, and what non-existence is there to be retained? Because there is no duality in the one nature.
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c19_19']	肇公云：	肇公云：	05a	Master Sengzhao said:
['ZH_T39_1799_05a:0892c20_10']	「有既不有，則無無矣。	「有既不有，則無無矣。	05a	Since existence is not existent, then non-existence is also non-existent.
