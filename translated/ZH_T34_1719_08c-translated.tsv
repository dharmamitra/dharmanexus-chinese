According to the later reduction in number, it should be said to be one Dharma. Why is it only the three of robe, seat, and room that correspond to the various dharmas?
['ZH_T34_1719_08c:0305a11_18']	答者，準事顯理須具三法，況依當文應具三法，乃為眾說，故具事理二三方可說法，故先事解，次事理合，三單約理。	答者，準事顯理須具三法，況依當文應具三法，乃為眾說，故具事理二三方可說法，故先事解，次事理合，三單約理。	08c	The answer is: according to the principle of clarifying the principle, it must be equipped with three dharmas, let alone relying on the present text, it should be equipped with three dharmas, and then it can be spoken to the assembly. Therefore, the principle and phenomena of the two three must be spoken of.

According to the Buddha's original intention, they are both what can penetrate. According to the understanding of the objects and conditions, there are two. All dull bodhisattvas also know that the three teachings can penetrate, but before the Lotus Sutra, the conditions have not yet come together, so in the past they were both closed. Now they are all opened, so they are also distinguished in relation to the real. How can it be that the expedient means open the real aspect while the expedient means are still closed and the true reality is opened?
['ZH_T34_1719_08c:0308a29_3']	此釋同河西實相亦二者，向但直對方便故今委論，同於方便故云亦也。	此釋同河西實相亦二者，向但直對方便故今委論，同於方便故云亦也。	08c	This explanation is the same as that of the Trepitaka. The real aspect is also two. Previously, it was only directly opposed to the expedient means, so now it is discussed in detail. It is the same as the expedient means, so it is said to be also.
['ZH_T34_1719_08c:0308b05_1']	「虛通」者，釋實當體為門，無礙名虛、無壅曰通，故得全體成能通門，含受一切無所隔礙，得名為門，遍一切處無非門故，是則約實無通而通，故云「不二」及以「法界」，法界即門名法界門，不同算砂當體門也。	「虛通」者，釋實當體為門，無礙名虛、無壅曰通，故得全體成能通門，含受一切無所隔礙，得名為門，遍一切處無非門故，是則約實無通而通，故云「不二」及以「法界」，法界即門名法界門，不同算砂當體門也。	08c	Empty and penetrating means that the true nature is used as the gate, unobstructed is called empty, and unblocked is called penetrating. Therefore, the entire essence becomes the gate of penetration, containing everything without obstruction, and can be called a gate, because everywhere is the gate. This means that in terms of the true nature, there is no penetration but penetration, so it is called non-dual and dharma realm. The dharma realm is the gate, called the dharma realm gate, which is different from the gate of counting sand and the true nature.
['ZH_T34_1719_08c:0308b08_9']	二「能通方便作門」者，使方便至實故名能通，若非實相之力，方便無由得開，故知秖一實理從二得名，由虛通故令他所歸，如赦體遍原罪無不釋。	二「能通方便作門」者，使方便至實故名能通，若非實相之力，方便無由得開，故知秖一實理從二得名，由虛通故令他所歸，如赦體遍原罪無不釋。	08c	Second, the expedient means of penetration means that expedient means reach the truth, so it is called penetration. If it were not for the power of the true aspect, expedient means would have no way to open up. Therefore, we know that it is only the true principle that gets its name from the two. Because of emptiness and penetration, it causes others to return to it, just as the amnesty covers all crimes and releases them.
['ZH_T34_1719_08c:0308b10_15']	「劉虬」意者，初句正明真實為方便作門，次句明三方便為真實作門，言「非三」去明二門互開。	「劉虬」意者，初句正明真實為方便作門，次句明三方便為真實作門，言「非三」去明二門互開。	08c	Liu Qiong means: the first sentence correctly clarifies that the real is the gate for the expedient, the next sentence clarifies that the three expedient means are the gate for the real, and the words not three clarify that the two gates mutually open.

If compared to the annotator, their words are very verbose and their principles are confused. Although they speak much, there is little substance, and it is not as good as sticking to one.

The meaning of the first chapter is that the expedient is obstructed by emotions, but now that the expedient has been revealed, it is called 通.

['ZH_T34_1719_08c:0308b23_4']	若欲敘出第二例者，如以三一為非三非一之門，由達三一通至雙非，即以三一為雙非門，由雙非故起於三一，故非三非一為三一門。	若欲敘出第二例者，如以三一為非三非一之門，由達三一通至雙非，即以三一為雙非門，由雙非故起於三一，故非三非一為三一門。	08c	If you want to present the second example, it is like using three and one as the gate of neither three nor one. By penetrating three and one, one reaches both negations, so using three and one as the gate of both negations. Because of both negations, three and one arise, so neither three nor one becomes the gate of three and one.

But one cannot take one as provisional and three as real, using the text of the Śrīmālā-sūtra is not the meaning of now.

In the first chapter, only the three are refuted as one gate, and the one is not yet refuted as three gates.

Only by not passing through is it blocked, and it is left to itself as not a gate. It should also be said:

Therefore, the one of the one not being three is not the three of the one family, and the three of the three not being one is not the one of the three families.

First, it cites in the one Buddha vehicle, distinctions are made and spoken of as three, to prove the three that are identical to one. Next, it cites the practices that you are engaged in are the bodhisattva path, to prove the one that is identical to the three.

The next phrase reveals the present, therefore it says the bodhisattva path. Since the past teaching has not yet been spoken, the three and one are still separated, and it does not say that the three are manifested as the three of one and the one of three is the one of three.
