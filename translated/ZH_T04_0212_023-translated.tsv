['ZH_T04_0212_023:0730c09_16']	如龜藏其六，比丘攝意想者，猶彼神龜畏喪身命，設見怨讎藏六甲裏，內自思惟：	如龜藏其六，比丘攝意想者，猶彼神龜畏喪身命，設見怨讎藏六甲裏，內自思惟：	023	As for just as a turtle hides its six limbs, a bhikṣu should restrain his thoughts, it is like that divine turtle fearing for its life. If it sees an enemy, it hides its six limbs. It thinks to itself:
['ZH_T04_0212_023:0730c12_5']	「若我不藏六者，便為獵者所擒，或梟其首，或傷前左右足，或斷後左右脚，或毀我尾，今不防慮定死無疑。	「若我不藏六者，便為獵者所擒，或梟其首，或傷前左右足，或斷後左右脚，或毀我尾，今不防慮定死無疑。	023	If I do not hide my six limbs, I will be captured by hunters, either my head will be cut off, or my front left and right feet will be injured, or my hind left and right legs will be broken, or my tail will be damaged. Now if I do not take precautions, death is certain.
['ZH_T04_0212_023:0730c13_9']	」比丘習行亦復如是，畏惡生死攝意亂想，恒自思惟：	」比丘習行亦復如是，畏惡生死攝意亂想，恒自思惟：	023	A bhikṣu's practice is also like this. Fearing the evil of birth and death, he restrains his thoughts and disordered thoughts, always thinking to himself:

If one does not restrain oneself now, one will then be controlled by the evil demon Pāpīyān and the desire-realm demon Māra, the son of Heaven, and they will have their way with one.

One should not rely on the various bonds, attachments, wrong actions, and inversions. If one wishes to rely on something, one should only rely on the noble truths. If one wishes to reach a place of peace and security, it is like a long-term patient who is weak and bedridden, unable to move or defecate. Or it is like an extremely old and weak person who is unable to get up and must be supported by strong men under the armpits. If one wishes to reach a place of peace and security, one will safely reach there.

Their faculties are dull and they are not very diligent in profound meanings. Even if they encounter a good friend and rely on a place of support, they gradually escape the realm of birth and death. Therefore, the World-Honored One expounds the teachings for later generations, not relying on birth and death, giving rise to a mind of harm, not relying on anything harmful, and then attaining the path.

After the fire is extinguished, there are no more signs of blazing flames.
['ZH_T04_0212_023:0731a01_3']	凡夫之士亦復如是，以貪熾火瞋恚熾火愚癡熾火，焚燒功德善根永盡無餘，既自喪福復使他人不至究竟。	凡夫之士亦復如是，以貪熾火瞋恚熾火愚癡熾火，焚燒功德善根永盡無餘，既自喪福復使他人不至究竟。	023	Ordinary people are also like this.

They amused themselves with the five kinds of music, playing the zither, drum, and flute, singing and dancing to their heart's content. Hearing the music, he became tired and fell asleep.

They saw the Bodhisattva sitting under a tree, his countenance upright like the color of a peach blossom. Whoever saw him was overjoyed, like the sun just rising, illuminating everywhere, like the moon in the sky with the stars and constellations standing out.

If a person is defiled by lust and attachment, they will later fall into the realm of birds, beasts, and pigeons. The foul stench and impurity will lead to a fall into the evil destinies. This is not what the sages and true persons practice.
