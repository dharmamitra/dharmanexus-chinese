The offerings brought by the devas, humans, and asuras will now become the last offerings. Let all beings obtain unshakable bliss from me. You and others will encounter a good field of blessings. If you do not obstruct the perfection of giving in the Tathāgata, the Perfectly Enlightened One, you will also naturally accomplish the Tathāgata's field of blessings.

It was like when the sun rises and shines on the green leaves of trees, revealing all the red veins. The elder Cunda was also like this, shedding blood and tears, and said to the Buddha:

['ZH_T12_0376_001:0860c29_5']	然如來泥洹甚深之義，非我凡細所能測量，亦非聲聞緣覺所知，唯佛世尊智慧境界。	然如來泥洹甚深之義，非我凡細所能測量，亦非聲聞緣覺所知，唯佛世尊智慧境界。	However, the profound meaning of the Tathāgata's nirvāṇa cannot be fathomed by my ordinary mind, nor can it be known by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. It is only the realm of wisdom of the Buddha, the World-Honored One.

Because the food was ready, they returned to their home.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
