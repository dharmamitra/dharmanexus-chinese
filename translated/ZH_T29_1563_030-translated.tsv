['ZH_T29_1563_030:0919c28_2']	如何脩習四念住耶？	如何脩習四念住耶？	How does one cultivate the four foundations of mindfulness?
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0919c28_16']	以自相共相觀身、受、心、法。	以自相共相觀身、受、心、法。	By observing body, feelings, mind, and dharmas with their specific and general characteristics.

['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a02_1']	分別此法與所餘法有差別義，名觀自相。	分別此法與所餘法有差別義，名觀自相。	Distinguishing the meaning of the difference between this dharma and the remaining dharmas is called observing the specific characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a02_19']	分別此法與所餘法無差別義，名觀共相。	分別此法與所餘法無差別義，名觀共相。	Distinguishing the meaning of the non-difference between this dharma and the remaining dharmas is called observing the common characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a03_17']	且身念住觀自相者，謂觀察身諸處別相。	且身念住觀自相者，謂觀察身諸處別相。	As for the foundation of mindfulness of the body observing the specific characteristics, it means observing the specific characteristics of the various parts of the body.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a04_17']	觀共相者，謂觀諸處同是身相，成色相同。	觀共相者，謂觀諸處同是身相，成色相同。	Observing the common characteristics means observing that all the parts are the same in being the characteristics of the body, the same in being the characteristics of form.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a05_10']	或觀自相者，謂觀身別相。	或觀自相者，謂觀身別相。	Or, observing the specific characteristics means observing the individual characteristics of the body.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a06_8']	觀共相者，謂觀察身與餘有為皆非常等。	觀共相者，謂觀察身與餘有為皆非常等。	Observing the common characteristics means observing that the body is impermanent, etc., like the other conditioned things.

['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a07_17']	此四各三，謂自性等，自性謂慧唯聞等三。	此四各三，謂自性等，自性謂慧唯聞等三。	These four each have three kinds, such as their intrinsic natures, etc. The intrinsic natures are wisdom and the three of hearing, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a08_6']	相雜謂餘此俱有法。	相雜謂餘此俱有法。	The mixed refers to the dharmas that exist together with these three.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a08_15']	所緣謂此三慧所緣。	所緣謂此三慧所緣。	The objects refer to the objects of these three kinds of wisdom.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a09_5']	何故此三皆名念住？	何故此三皆名念住？	Why are these three all called foundations of mindfulness?
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a11_5']	由念令慧得住所緣，念慧相資勝定等故，由此於慧立念住名，此相雜所緣故亦名念住。	由念令慧得住所緣，念慧相資勝定等故，由此於慧立念住名，此相雜所緣故亦名念住。	Mindfulness causes wisdom to obtain stability on its object, because mindfulness and wisdom assist each other in the excellent samādhi, etc. Therefore, the name “mindfulness” is established for wisdom. It is also called “mindfulness” because it is mixed with the object.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a11_14']	何緣故說三種念住？	何緣故說三種念住？	Why is it said that there are three kinds of mindfulness?

['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a13_13']	或根勝解分位各三，機宜不同，故說三種。	或根勝解分位各三，機宜不同，故說三種。	Or, there are three kinds because of the three differences of faculties, resolve, and stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a14_12']	三中相雜能斷煩惱，非二能斷，太減增故。	三中相雜能斷煩惱，非二能斷，太減增故。	Among the three, that which is mixed is able to eliminate the passions, and the other two are not able to eliminate them, because they are too weak or excessive.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a15_10']	然相雜言，亦攝慧體，慧與俱有互相雜故。	然相雜言，亦攝慧體，慧與俱有互相雜故。	However, the term “mixed” also includes the substance of wisdom, because wisdom and its associates are mutually mixed.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a16_8']	若言自性，應無所待，顯有所待說相雜言。	若言自性，應無所待，顯有所待說相雜言。	If it is said to be the essence, it should not depend on anything. In order to show that it depends on something, the term “mixed” is used.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a18_6']	唯修所成法念住攝，能斷煩惱要在定中，能斷惑故緣四五蘊，或緣涅槃能斷惑故。	唯修所成法念住攝，能斷煩惱要在定中，能斷惑故緣四五蘊，或緣涅槃能斷惑故。	It is included in the mindfulness of dharmas that is cultivated by means of practice, because eliminating the passions must be in samādhi. Because it can eliminate the passions, it takes the four or five aggregates as objects. Because it can eliminate the passions, it takes nirvāṇa as an object.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a19_14']	法念住中共相作意，能斷煩惱自相作意，緣少分境故無此能。	法念住中共相作意，能斷煩惱自相作意，緣少分境故無此能。	The attention directed to the common characteristics of the four foundations of mindfulness can eliminate the passions, but the attention directed to the specific characteristics of the four foundations of mindfulness can only eliminate the passions, because it has only a small part of the object in common.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a20_13']	四念住內前之三種唯不雜緣，第四通二。	四念住內前之三種唯不雜緣，第四通二。	The first three of the four foundations of mindfulness have only unmixed objects, but the fourth has both mixed and unmixed objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a22_2']	然三諦智唯有雜緣能斷煩惱，唯滅諦智雖不雜緣亦斷煩惱。	然三諦智唯有雜緣能斷煩惱，唯滅諦智雖不雜緣亦斷煩惱。	However, the knowledge of the three truths has only mixed objects and can eliminate the passions. The knowledge of the truth of cessation, although it has only unmixed objects, can also eliminate the passions.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a23_1']	身等念住各有三種，緣內、外、俱有差別故。	身等念住各有三種，緣內、外、俱有差別故。	The foundations of mindfulness of body, etc., are each of three kinds, because there are differences in the internal, external, and both internal and external.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a24_19']	且身念住有三種中，緣自相續說名為內，緣他身等說名為外，雙緣二種說為內外。	且身念住有三種中，緣自相續說名為內，緣他身等說名為外，雙緣二種說為內外。	Of the three kinds of foundations of mindfulness of body, that which has as its object the continuity of ones own body is called internal, that which has as its object the bodies, etc., of others is called external, and that which has as its object both is called internal and external.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a25_17']	以有我愛而慢緩者，應觀內身猶如外故。	以有我愛而慢緩者，應觀內身猶如外故。	One who has self love and is lax should contemplate the internal body as if it were external.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a27_16']	或內如前，緣無執受說名為外，緣他相續說為內外，待無執受及待自身，得二名故。	或內如前，緣無執受說名為外，緣他相續說為內外，待無執受及待自身，得二名故。	Or, the internal is as explained above, that which has as its object the non appropriated is called external, and that which has as its object the continuity of others is called internal and external, because it acquires the two names of non appropriated and of ones own body.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a28_6']	或緣根境及俱名三。	或緣根境及俱名三。	Or, it has as its objects the sense bases, the objects, and both, and is called the three.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920a29_6']	或緣有情及非情數、通緣二種，差別為三。	或緣有情及非情數、通緣二種，差別為三。	Or, it takes as object sentient beings and insentient things, and both together, and is distinguished into three.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b01_4']	或緣有情，外非情數及毛髮等，差別為三。	或緣有情，外非情數及毛髮等，差別為三。	Or, it takes as object sentient beings, external insentient things, and hair, etc., and is distinguished into three.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b02_3']	以彼皆從內身生故、離根住故，具得二名。	以彼皆從內身生故、離根住故，具得二名。	Because they all arise from the internal body and exist apart from the faculties, they are given both names.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b04_2']	或緣有情現在名內，緣外非情三世名外，緣情去來說為內外，有情類故、墮法數故。	或緣有情現在名內，緣外非情三世名外，緣情去來說為內外，有情類故、墮法數故。	Or, it takes as object sentient beings in the present as internal, and insentient things in the three times as external. It takes as object sentient beings in the past as internal and external, because they are a class of sentient beings and fall into the category of dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b05_19']	又彼未來當墮情數、正墮法數，彼過去時曾墮情數、正墮法數，彼不生法是生類故。	又彼未來當墮情數、正墮法數，彼過去時曾墮情數、正墮法數，彼不生法是生類故。	Moreover, in the future they will fall into the category of sentient beings and correctly fall into the category of dharmas. In the past, they once fell into the category of sentient beings and correctly fell into the category of dharmas. Those dharmas that are unarisen are of the class of the arisen,

['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b07_7']	此四念住說次隨生。	此四念住說次隨生。	These four foundations of mindfulness are said to arise in sequence.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b07_16']	生復何緣次第如是？	生復何緣次第如是？	Why is the order of arising like this?
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b08_7']	生次如是，相隨順故。	生次如是，相隨順故。	The order of arising is like this because the characteristics are mutually supportive.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b09_6']	有情多分於諸色中好受用故，不逮勝法。	有情多分於諸色中好受用故，不逮勝法。	Because sentient beings are for the most part attached to the enjoyment of form, they do not attain the superior Dharma.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b09_15']	好受用色以何為緣？	好受用色以何為緣？	What is the cause of this attachment to the enjoyment of form?
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b11_3']	謂於受中情深欣樂，欣樂於受由心不調，心之不調由諸煩惱。	謂於受中情深欣樂，欣樂於受由心不調，心之不調由諸煩惱。	It is because of deep attachment to feeling. This attachment to feeling is due to an undisciplined mind, and the undisciplined mind is due to the passions.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b12_2']	心由信等可令調伏，隨觀此理四念住生。	心由信等可令調伏，隨觀此理四念住生。	The mind can be disciplined by faith and so on. One contemplates these principles and the four foundations of mindfulness arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b12_11']	或隨所緣麁細生故。	或隨所緣麁細生故。	Or they arise in accordance with the coarseness or subtlety of the objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b13_9']	然非由此心，最後觀法中涅槃極微細故。	然非由此心，最後觀法中涅槃極微細故。	However, this is not because the mind, in the final contemplation of dharmas, is extremely subtle because of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b14_17']	彼想思等循觀受時，准義已能了知其相，同依心起等安危故。	彼想思等循觀受時，准義已能了知其相，同依心起等安危故。	When one contemplates feeling in the same way as one contemplates form, one can understand its characteristics by analogy, because they arise together with the mind and share the same fate.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b15_3']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b17_6']	色可聚散可取可捨，相似相續不淨苦等易了知故，多分緣身生貪等故，男女展轉起貪處故。	色可聚散可取可捨，相似相續不淨苦等易了知故，多分緣身生貪等故，男女展轉起貪處故。	Form can be aggregated and dispersed, can be grasped and abandoned, and its continuity is similar. Impurity, suffering, etc., are easy to understand, and craving, etc., are generated in the body in most cases. Men and women generate craving in each other.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b18_12']	不淨觀、持息念及分別界三入修門，一切多緣身為境故。	不淨觀、持息念及分別界三入修門，一切多緣身為境故。	The three contemplations of impurity, mindfulness of breathing, and discernment of the elements are all gateways to cultivation that take the body as their object in most cases.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b20_11']	修念住位應最初觀，此觀為因生輕安觸，由輕安觸引樂受生，經說身安便受樂故。	修念住位應最初觀，此觀為因生輕安觸，由輕安觸引樂受生，經說身安便受樂故。	When cultivating the foundations of mindfulness, one should first contemplate this, because this contemplation gives rise to the touch of lightness and comfort, and the touch of lightness and comfort leads to the arising of pleasant feeling, because a sūtra says that when the body is at ease, one experiences pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b21_10']	如是樂受依心而生，淨心為因得解脫果。	如是樂受依心而生，淨心為因得解脫果。	In this way, pleasant feeling arises in dependence on the mind, and pure mind as a cause leads to the attainment of the fruit of liberation.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b22_8']	由是受等隨次而觀，故念住生如是次第。	由是受等隨次而觀，故念住生如是次第。	For this reason, feeling, etc., are contemplated in sequence, and thus the foundations of mindfulness arise in this order.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b23_7']	此四念住不增不減，能治淨等四顛倒故。	此四念住不增不減，能治淨等四顛倒故。	These four foundations of mindfulness are neither more nor less, because they can cure the four inversions of purity, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b24_2']	觀身不淨，治於不淨謂淨顛倒。	觀身不淨，治於不淨謂淨顛倒。	Contemplating the body as impure cures the inversion of regarding the impure as pure.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b25_5']	雖淨顛倒通緣五蘊，然但觀身自性非淨便能總伏。	雖淨顛倒通緣五蘊，然但觀身自性非淨便能總伏。	Although the inversion of regarding the impure as pure is common to all five aggregates, still, merely contemplating the body's own nature as impure is able to completely subdue it.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b26_4']	如人已觀糞體不淨，亦不欣樂從糞所生。	如人已觀糞體不淨，亦不欣樂從糞所生。	Just as a person who has already contemplated the impure nature of excrement also does not delight in what arises from excrement,
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b27_3']	如是已觀身體不淨，亦不欣樂從身所生。	如是已觀身體不淨，亦不欣樂從身所生。	in the same way, having already contemplated the impure nature of the body, one also does not delight in what arises from the body.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b28_2']	由此觀身為不淨者，於五取蘊皆不欣樂。	由此觀身為不淨者，於五取蘊皆不欣樂。	Therefore, those who contemplate the body as impure do not delight in the five aggregates of clinging.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b29_1']	以有為身淨想迷者，彼方欣樂依身所生。	以有為身淨想迷者，彼方欣樂依身所生。	Those who are deluded by the notion of purity in the conditioned body delight in what arises based on the body.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920b29_19']	是故觀身為不淨者，於身所起亦不欣樂。	是故觀身為不淨者，於身所起亦不欣樂。	Therefore, those who contemplate the body as impure do not delight in what arises from the body.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c02_7']	如有安住不淨觀時，雖不親觀聲等為境，而於歌等棄如糞穢。	如有安住不淨觀時，雖不親觀聲等為境，而於歌等棄如糞穢。	Just as when one abides in the contemplation of impurity, although one does not directly contemplate sound, etc., as objects, one discards singing, etc., as if it were excrement.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c04_5']	如是安住身念住時，雖不親觀受等為境，觀身自體為不淨故，終不欣樂受等三境。	如是安住身念住時，雖不親觀受等為境，觀身自體為不淨故，終不欣樂受等三境。	In the same way, when one abides in the mindfulness of the body, although one does not directly contemplate feelings, etc., as objects, because one contemplates the body itself as impure, one never delights in the three objects such as feelings, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c06_12']	又雖不觀色無色境以為不淨，而於彼境非不引生不樂行相，是故淨倒雖緣五蘊，身念住成便能總伏。	又雖不觀色無色境以為不淨，而於彼境非不引生不樂行相，是故淨倒雖緣五蘊，身念住成便能總伏。	Moreover, although one does not contemplate the form and formless realms as impure, one does not fail to generate the aspect of non-delight towards those objects. Therefore, although the notion of purity takes the five aggregates as its object, when the mindfulness of the body is accomplished, it is able to subdue them all in general.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c07_11']	後三念住雖各別觀，例此應思能總伏理。	後三念住雖各別觀，例此應思能總伏理。	The last three types of mindfulness should be contemplated in the same way, and one should consider how the principle of subduing in general is accomplished.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c08_5']	觀受是苦，能治於苦謂樂顛倒。	觀受是苦，能治於苦謂樂顛倒。	Contemplating that feelings are suffering cures the error of considering suffering to be pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c09_1']	謂若有法真可欣欲，是為樂義。	謂若有法真可欣欲，是為樂義。	That is, if a dharma is truly desirable, it is called pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c10_8']	於多過患所雜行中，見有可欣殊勝功德，是名於苦謂樂顛倒。	於多過患所雜行中，見有可欣殊勝功德，是名於苦謂樂顛倒。	Seeing a superior quality that is desirable in a practice mixed with many faults is called the error of considering suffering to be pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c12_6']	此倒必用耽受為先，以於受中深耽著已，方於一切逼惱所依有漏行中妄生樂想。	此倒必用耽受為先，以於受中深耽著已，方於一切逼惱所依有漏行中妄生樂想。	This error must be preceded by indulgence in feelings, because after deeply indulging in feelings, one falsely generates the idea of pleasure in all contaminated practices that serve as the basis for affliction.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c13_6']	是故觀受為苦性時，便能總伏計樂顛倒。	是故觀受為苦性時，便能總伏計樂顛倒。	Therefore, when one contemplates that feelings have the nature of suffering, one is then able to subdue in general the error of considering suffering to be pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c14_1']	觀心非常，能治非常謂常顛倒。	觀心非常，能治非常謂常顛倒。	Contemplating that the mind is impermanent cures the error of considering the impermanent to be permanent.
['ZH_T29_1563_030:0920c16_12']	謂觀行者憎厭受故，於所依心見有眾多品類差別，引非常觀令現在前，便於有為不生常想，故能總伏計常顛倒。	謂觀行者憎厭受故，於所依心見有眾多品類差別，引非常觀令現在前，便於有為不生常想，故能總伏計常顛倒。	That is, because the practitioner detests and despises feelings, he sees that the mind that serves as their basis has many different kinds of distinctions. He then draws forth the contemplation of impermanence and makes it present. He then does not generate the idea of permanence with regard to the conditioned, and therefore he is able to subdue in general the error of considering the impermanent to be permanent.

Now for the first time one sees that they are only the nature of the dharmas of suffering, and one is patient and resigned to this fact.
