['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a17_8']	第一、先標序題者。	第一、先標序題者。	001	First, first listing the preface title.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a18_15']	竊以真如廣大，五乘不測其邊，法性深高，十聖莫窮其際。	竊以真如廣大，五乘不測其邊，法性深高，十聖莫窮其際。	001	I humbly think that true suchness is vast, and the five vehicles cannot fathom its limits. The nature of dharmas is profound and lofty, and the ten sages cannot exhaust its bounds.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a20_4']	真如之體量量性不出蠢蠢之心，法性無邊邊體則元來不動。	真如之體量量性不出蠢蠢之心，法性無邊邊體則元來不動。	001	The essence of true suchness is immeasurable, and its nature does not go beyond the minds of all beings. The boundless essence of the nature of dharmas is originally unmoving.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a21_5']	無塵法界凡聖齊圓，兩垢如如則普該於含識。	無塵法界凡聖齊圓，兩垢如如則普該於含識。	001	In the Dharma realm without dust, ordinary beings and sages are equally perfect. The two defilements and suchness then universally encompass all sentient beings.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a24_7']	恒沙功德寂用湛然，但以垢障覆深，淨體無由顯照，故使大悲隱於西化，驚入火宅之門，灑甘露潤於群萌，輝智炬則朗重昏於永夜。	恒沙功德寂用湛然，但以垢障覆深，淨體無由顯照，故使大悲隱於西化，驚入火宅之門，灑甘露潤於群萌，輝智炬則朗重昏於永夜。	001	The merits of the Ganges sands are tranquil and functioning, but they are covered by deep defilements, and the pure essence has no way to manifest and illuminate. Therefore, great compassion is hidden in the Western transformation, and one is startled to enter the gate of the burning house. Sprinkling the moisture of sweet dew on the myriad sprouts, the brilliance of the torch of wisdom then illuminates the heavy darkness of the eternal night.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a25_14']	三檀等備，四攝齊收，開示長劫之苦因，悟入永生之樂果。	三檀等備，四攝齊收，開示長劫之苦因，悟入永生之樂果。	001	The three types of generosity are complete, and the four means of gathering disciples are all included. Revealing the causes of suffering for a long eon, one awakens to and enters the fruition of eternal bliss.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a28_1']	不謂群迷性隔樂欲不同，雖無一實之機，等有五乘之用，致使布慈雲於三界，注法雨於大悲。	不謂群迷性隔樂欲不同，雖無一實之機，等有五乘之用，致使布慈雲於三界，注法雨於大悲。	001	I did not expect that the deluded masses have different natures and preferences, although there is no single real teaching, they all have the function of the five vehicles. This causes the spreading of the cloud of compassion in the three realms, and the pouring of the rain of Dharma with great compassion.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246a29_17']	莫不等洽塵勞，普沾未聞之益，菩提種子藉此以抽心，正覺之芽念念因茲增長。	莫不等洽塵勞，普沾未聞之益，菩提種子藉此以抽心，正覺之芽念念因茲增長。	001	There is no one who is not equally nourished by the dust and labor, and all receive the benefit of the unheard. The seeds of bodhi sprout from this, and the sprouts of right enlightenment grow more and more from this.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b02_12']	依心起於勝行，門餘八萬四千，漸頓則各稱所宜，隨緣者則皆蒙解脫。	依心起於勝行，門餘八萬四千，漸頓則各稱所宜，隨緣者則皆蒙解脫。	001	Relying on the mind to give rise to superior practices, there are the remaining eighty-four thousand, gradually and suddenly each according to what is suitable, for those who follow conditions all receive liberation.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b05_13']	然眾生障重，取悟之者難明，雖可教益多門，凡惑無由遍攬，遇因韋提致請，我今樂欲往生安樂，唯願如來教我思惟、教我正受。	然眾生障重，取悟之者難明，雖可教益多門，凡惑無由遍攬，遇因韋提致請，我今樂欲往生安樂，唯願如來教我思惟、教我正受。	001	However, sentient beings have heavy obstructions, and those who seek understanding find it difficult. Although the teachings can benefit through many approaches, ordinary delusions have no way to comprehensively grasp. Encountering the cause of Vaidehī's request, I now happily wish to be reborn in the Land of Bliss. I only pray that the Tathāgata will teach me to contemplate and teach me the correct practice.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b07_7']	然娑婆化主因其請故，即廣開淨土之要門，安樂能人顯彰別意之弘願。	然娑婆化主因其請故，即廣開淨土之要門，安樂能人顯彰別意之弘願。	001	However, the teacher of the Sahā world, because of her request, extensively opened the essential gate of the Pure Land, and the person of the Land of Bliss revealed the vast vow of the separate meaning.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b08_4']	其要門者，即此《觀經》定散二門是也。	其要門者，即此《觀經》定散二門是也。	001	The essential approach is precisely the two methods of concentration and recitation in this Contemplation Sutra.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b09_12']	定即息慮以凝心，散即廢惡以修善，迴斯二行求願往生也。	定即息慮以凝心，散即廢惡以修善，迴斯二行求願往生也。	001	Concentration means stilling the mind by regulating the breath, while recitation means abandoning evil and cultivating goodness. One turns these two practices to seek rebirth in the Pure Land.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b11_14']	言弘願者，如《大經》說，一切善惡凡夫得生者，莫不皆乘阿彌陀佛大願業力為增上緣也。	言弘願者，如《大經》說，一切善惡凡夫得生者，莫不皆乘阿彌陀佛大願業力為增上緣也。	001	As for the vast vow, as the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, all ordinary beings who are born there, whether good or evil, are none other than those who ride on the power of the great vow and karma of Amitâbha Buddha as the dominant condition.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b13_10']	又佛密意弘深，教門難曉，三賢十聖，弗測所闚，況我信外輕毛敢知旨趣。	又佛密意弘深，教門難曉，三賢十聖，弗測所闚，況我信外輕毛敢知旨趣。	001	Moreover, the Buddha's profound and vast intention is difficult to understand in the teachings. The three ranks of sages and ten stages of the bodhisattva cannot fathom it, let alone I, a mere speck of dust outside of faith, who dares to know the purport.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b15_1']	仰惟釋迦此方發遣，彌陀即彼國來迎，彼喚此遣，豈容不去也。	仰惟釋迦此方發遣，彌陀即彼國來迎，彼喚此遣，豈容不去也。	001	I respectfully consider that Śākyamuni sends us here, while Amitâbha comes to welcome us from that land. If he calls us here and sends us there, how can we refuse to go?
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b16_8']	唯可勤心奉法，畢命為期，捨此穢身，即證彼法性之常樂。	唯可勤心奉法，畢命為期，捨此穢身，即證彼法性之常樂。	001	We can only diligently uphold the Dharma with utmost sincerity, making the end of life our goal. Abandoning this defiled body, we will immediately realize the eternal bliss of the Dharma-nature in that land.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b16_16']	此即略標序題竟。	此即略標序題竟。	001	This is the brief introduction to the title.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b17_7']	第二、次釋名者。	第二、次釋名者。	001	Second, next is the explanation of the name.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b17_21']	經言《佛說無量壽觀經》一卷。	經言《佛說無量壽觀經》一卷。	001	The sutra says The Sutra on the Contemplation of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life in one fascicle.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b18_10']	言佛者，乃是西國正音。	言佛者，乃是西國正音。	001	The word Buddha is the correct pronunciation in the Western Regions.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b19_10']	此土名覺，自覺覺他覺行窮滿，名之為佛。	此土名覺，自覺覺他覺行窮滿，名之為佛。	001	In this land, it is called enlightened one. One who has enlightened oneself, enlightened others, and perfected the practice of enlightenment is called a Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b21_2']	言自覺者，簡異凡夫，此由聲聞狹劣唯能自利、闕無利他大悲故。	言自覺者，簡異凡夫，此由聲聞狹劣唯能自利、闕無利他大悲故。	001	As for enlightened oneself, it distinguishes from ordinary people. This is because the Śrāvakas are narrow-minded and inferior, only able to benefit themselves and lacking the great compassion to benefit others.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b23_5']	言覺他者，簡異二乘，此由菩薩有智故能自利，有悲故能利他，常能悲智雙行、不著有無也。	言覺他者，簡異二乘，此由菩薩有智故能自利，有悲故能利他，常能悲智雙行、不著有無也。	001	As for enlightened others, it distinguishes from the Two Vehicles. This is because the Bodhisattvas have wisdom, so they can benefit themselves, and have compassion, so they can benefit others. They are always able to practice compassion and wisdom together, without being attached to existence or non-existence.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b25_3']	言覺行窮滿者，簡異菩薩，此由如來智行已窮、時劫已滿，出過三位，故名為佛。	言覺行窮滿者，簡異菩薩，此由如來智行已窮、時劫已滿，出過三位，故名為佛。	001	As for perfected the practice of enlightenment, it distinguishes from the Bodhisattvas. This is because the Tathāgata has exhausted his wisdom and practice, and his time and eons are already full. He surpasses the three periods of time, so he is called a Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b25_16']	言說者，口音陳唱故名為說。	言說者，口音陳唱故名為說。	001	As for speaking, it is called speaking because the oral sounds are proclaimed.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b28_4']	又如來對機說法多種不同，漸頓隨宜，隱彰有異，或六根通說，相好亦然，應念隨緣，皆蒙證益也。	又如來對機說法多種不同，漸頓隨宜，隱彰有異，或六根通說，相好亦然，應念隨緣，皆蒙證益也。	001	Moreover, the Tathāgata's teachings for different capacities are of many kinds, gradual and sudden as appropriate, with hidden and revealed differences. Sometimes the six sense faculties are taught together, and the same is true for the major marks. Responding to thoughts and conditions, all receive the benefit of realization.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b28_17']	言無量壽者，乃是此地漢音。	言無量壽者，乃是此地漢音。	001	As for immeasurable life, this is the Chinese pronunciation of the name of this land.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246b29_14']	言南無阿彌陀佛者，又是西國正音。	言南無阿彌陀佛者，又是西國正音。	001	As for namo Amitābha Buddha, this is the correct pronunciation in the Western regions.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c02_15']	又南者是歸，無者是命，阿者是無，彌者是量，陀者是壽，佛者是覺，故言歸命無量壽覺。	又南者是歸，無者是命，阿者是無，彌者是量，陀者是壽，佛者是覺，故言歸命無量壽覺。	001	Moreover, na means to return, mo means to entrust one's life, a means no, mi means immeasurable, ta means life, and fo means enlightenment. Therefore, it means entrusting one's life to the immeasurable life and enlightenment.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c03_8']	此乃梵漢相對，其義如此。	此乃梵漢相對，其義如此。	001	This is the meaning of the Sanskrit and Chinese terms corresponding to each other.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c04_15']	今言無量壽者是法，覺者是人，人法並彰，故名阿彌陀佛。	今言無量壽者是法，覺者是人，人法並彰，故名阿彌陀佛。	001	Now, immeasurable life refers to the Dharma, and enlightenment refers to the person. Both the Dharma and the person are revealed, so it is called Amitābha Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c05_7']	又言人法者是所觀之境。	又言人法者是所觀之境。	001	Moreover, person and Dharma refer to the observed realm.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c05_12']	即有其二：	即有其二：	001	There are two aspects:
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c06_3']	一者依報，二者正報。	一者依報，二者正報。	001	first, the dependent environment; second, the fundamental nature.

['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c08_17']	二者地上莊嚴，即一切寶地池林寶樓宮閣等是。	二者地上莊嚴，即一切寶地池林寶樓宮閣等是。	001	Second, the adornments above the ground, which include all the jeweled lands, ponds, forests, jeweled towers, palaces, and pavilions.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c10_9']	三者虛空莊嚴，即一切變化寶宮華網寶雲、化鳥風光動發聲樂等是。	三者虛空莊嚴，即一切變化寶宮華網寶雲、化鳥風光動發聲樂等是。	001	Third, the adornments in space, which include all the transformed jeweled palaces, flower nets, jeweled clouds, transformed birds, wind and light producing sounds and pleasures.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c11_15']	如前雖有三種差別，皆是彌陀淨國無漏真實之勝相。	如前雖有三種差別，皆是彌陀淨國無漏真實之勝相。	001	Although there are three kinds of distinctions as mentioned above, they are all the supreme characteristics of Amitâbha's Pure Land, which are uncontaminated and real.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c12_7']	此即總結成依報莊嚴也。	此即總結成依報莊嚴也。	001	This is a concluding summary of the adornments of the dependent environment.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c13_11']	又言依報者，從日觀下至華座觀已來總明依報。	又言依報者，從日觀下至華座觀已來總明依報。	001	Moreover, it is said that the dependent environment, from the sun contemplation down to the lotus seat contemplation, generally clarifies the dependent environment.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c14_5']	就此依報中即有通有別。	就此依報中即有通有別。	001	Within this dependent environment, there are both general and specific aspects.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c15_6']	言別者，華座一觀是其別依，唯屬彌陀佛也。	言別者，華座一觀是其別依，唯屬彌陀佛也。	001	As for the specific aspect, the single contemplation of the lotus seat is the specific dependent environment, which belongs exclusively to Amitâbha Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1753_001:0246c17_2']	餘上六觀是其通依，即屬法界之凡聖，但使得生者共同受用故言通也。	餘上六觀是其通依，即屬法界之凡聖，但使得生者共同受用故言通也。	001	The remaining six contemplations above are the general dependent environment, which belongs to the ordinary beings and sages of the Dharma realm.
