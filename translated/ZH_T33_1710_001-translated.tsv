Although it is very rare, it is not the definitive meaning, and it is a place where various disputes can arise.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523b26_4']	次復唯為趣大乘者轉隱密輪，說一切法皆無自性、無生無滅、本來涅槃，雖更希奇，猶未了義，亦諸諍論安足處所；	次復唯為趣大乘者轉隱密輪，說一切法皆無自性、無生無滅、本來涅槃，雖更希奇，猶未了義，亦諸諍論安足處所；	Next, he again only turned the wheel of concealment for those who aspire to the Mahāyāna, saying that all dharmas are without self-nature, without arising, without cessation, and originally in nirvāṇa. Although it is even more rare, it is still not the definitive meaning, and it is also a place where various disputes can arise.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523b28_2']	今為發趣一切乘者轉顯了輪，無上、無容，是勝義中真了義教，非諸諍論安足處所。	今為發趣一切乘者轉顯了輪，無上、無容，是勝義中真了義教，非諸諍論安足處所。	Now, for those who aspire to all vehicles, he turns the wheel of manifestation, which is unsurpassed and unsurpassed, and is the true definitive teaching in the ultimate truth, and it is not a place where various disputes can arise.

['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c03_7']	由諸有情迷法實相，起造惑業，淪生死海，大聖法王證法自性，善巧方便，應彼機宜，離言法中以言顯說，欲令隨獲中道實相，故有頌言：	由諸有情迷法實相，起造惑業，淪生死海，大聖法王證法自性，善巧方便，應彼機宜，離言法中以言顯說，欲令隨獲中道實相，故有頌言：	Because sentient beings are confused about the true nature of dharmas, they give rise to afflictions and create karma, sinking in the ocean of birth and death. The Great Sage, the Dharma King, realized the intrinsic nature of dharmas and skillfully adapted to the capacities of beings. In the inexpressible Dharma, he used words to reveal the teachings, wishing to enable them to attain the true nature of the Middle Way. Therefore, there is a verse that says:
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c04_0']	諸佛或說我，　　或時說無我，	諸佛或說我，　　或時說無我，	The Buddhas sometimes speak of self, and sometimes of no-self.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c05_13']	諸法實相中，　　無我無非我。	諸法實相中，　　無我無非我。	In the true nature of dharmas, there is neither self nor non-self.

Just as the heavenly drum emits sounds in response to thoughts, it is also similar to a wish-fulfilling gem that responds to beings' needs. Although various Dharma gates are set up in response to beings, the pure and harmonious wisdom-eye has not yet given rise to disputes.

['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c15_0']	真性有為空，　　如幻緣生故，	真性有為空，　　如幻緣生故，	The true nature of conditioned phenomena is empty, like an illusion arising from conditions,

['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c18_17']	彼言，世俗可說法有，依勝義諦一切皆空，雖此真空性非空、有，寄詮勝義理皆性空。	彼言，世俗可說法有，依勝義諦一切皆空，雖此真空性非空、有，寄詮勝義理皆性空。	They say that in the conventional truth, phenomena can be said to exist, but in the ultimate truth, all are empty. Although this true emptiness is neither empty nor existent, it is provisionally referred to as the ultimate truth, and all natures are empty.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c20_11']	有情由是次生空見，無著菩薩復請慈尊說中道教，雙除二執，而說頌言：	有情由是次生空見，無著菩薩復請慈尊說中道教，雙除二執，而說頌言：	Sentient beings, due to this, next give rise to the view of emptiness. The Bodhisattva Asaṅga again requested the Venerable Maitreya to explain the Middle Way teachings, eliminating both attachments, and spoke a verse, saying:
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c21_0']	虛妄分別有，　　於此二都無，	虛妄分別有，　　於此二都無，	False discrimination exists, but in these two [truths] it is utterly non-existent.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c22_13']	此中唯有空，　　於彼亦有此。	此中唯有空，　　於彼亦有此。	In this [conventional truth], there is only emptiness, and in that [ultimate truth], there is also this [conventional truth].
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c23_0']	故說一切法，　　非空非不空，	故說一切法，　　非空非不空，	Therefore it is said that all dharmas are neither empty nor not empty,
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c24_13']	有無及有故，　　是則契中道。	有無及有故，　　是則契中道。	Because of existence, nonexistence, and existence, this then accords with the middle way.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0523c27_6']	彼言，世俗說我、法有，依勝義諦唯此二空，雖佛為破執空、執有，總相宣說諸法有、空，或說諸法非空非有。	彼言，世俗說我、法有，依勝義諦唯此二空，雖佛為破執空、執有，總相宣說諸法有、空，或說諸法非空非有。	They say that conventionally speaking, self and dharmas exist, but in terms of ultimate truth, there are only these two kinds of emptiness. Although the Buddha refutes grasping emptiness and grasping existence, he generally proclaims that all dharmas are empty or not empty. Sometimes he says that all dharmas are neither empty nor not empty.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0524a01_19']	名字性離，空、有雙非，勝義寄詮，有空有有，故慈尊說，有為、無為名之為有，我及我所稱之為無，非說有、空法皆空、有，觀斯聖意，空、有無乖，法離智詮，何空何有？	名字性離，空、有雙非，勝義寄詮，有空有有，故慈尊說，有為、無為名之為有，我及我所稱之為無，非說有、空法皆空、有，觀斯聖意，空、有無乖，法離智詮，何空何有？	The nature of names is detached, empty, existent, and both non-existent and existent. The ultimate truth is provisionally expressed as empty existence and existent existence. Therefore Maitreya says, The conditioned and the unconditioned are called existent, while self and what belongs to self are called non-existent. It is not said that all existent and empty dharmas are empty and existent. Observing this holy intention, emptiness and existence are incompatible. Dharmas are detached from the expressions of cognition. What emptiness? What existence?
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0524a02_8']	對機遣病，假說有、空。	對機遣病，假說有、空。	In response to the capacities of beings, the illnesses are dispelled, and emptiness and existence are provisionally spoken of.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0524a04_14']	後諸學徒隨文起執，己之所解謂契中宗，他之所知將為謬說，今贊經義，申其兩端，妙理是非，智者當了。	後諸學徒隨文起執，己之所解謂契中宗，他之所知將為謬說，今贊經義，申其兩端，妙理是非，智者當了。	Later, the disciples followed the text and gave rise to attachments. They considered their own understanding to be in accord with the essence of the sutra, and considered the knowledge of others to be erroneous explanations. Now, I praise the meaning of the sutra and explain its two aspects. The wise ones should understand the right and wrong of the wonderful principle.

Seeking the meaning through the teachings, thoroughly understanding the arising of consciousness, the nature of wisdom and the resources of wisdom are all called prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1710_001:0524a13_11']	能除障習，證法真理，眾德之首，萬行之導，雖獨名慧，攝一切法。	能除障習，證法真理，眾德之首，萬行之導，雖獨名慧，攝一切法。	It can eliminate the habitual tendencies of afflictions and realize the true principle of dharmas. It is the foremost of all virtues and the guide of myriad practices. Although it is uniquely called wisdom, it includes all dharmas.

By practicing prajñā, one separates from all afflictive hindrances and objective hindrances, the end of existence and nonexistence, the thorough understanding of the six pāramitās, the penetrating understanding of truth and convention, the completion of the two causes of karma, the fulfillment of enlightenment and the perfection of quiescence. One thus ascends to the other shore. The essence and function are both mentioned, thus this name is established.

First, abiding in the bodhisattva lineage; second, relying on the mind of great enlightenment; third, compassion for sentient beings; fourth, being endowed with the practice of deeds; fifth, being subsumed by the wisdom of non-characteristics; sixth, dedicating to enlightenment; seventh, not being interspersed with the two hindrances.

Although the events are myriad phenomena, they are subsumed in form and become emptiness. The Way, although with a thousand gates, penetrates non-wisdom and is also attained.

It wishes to allow them to follow the realization, either relying on it or expounding it. Prajñā is sincere and real, and this sūtra is expounded. Therefore, it is regarded as the mind's eye, like the water and land flowers in the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra, and the Sūtras of the Ten Grounds, etc.

First, from 'Avalokitêśvara' it refutes the two attachments and reveals the two emptinesses. Later, from 'bodhisattva mahāsattva' it praises the two bases and attains the two benefits.

Therefore, now it is indicated that a bodhisattva should not be seen. Therefore, it refutes the attachment to arising and speaks of the emptiness of arising.
