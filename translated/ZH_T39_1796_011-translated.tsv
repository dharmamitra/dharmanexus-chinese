Therefore, it is called the gate of certain knowledge.
['ZH_T39_1796_011:0691a18_7']	法句者，謂先觸事，從事能生於理，故名為句，即是句偈依，世句偈法以名字說。	法句者，謂先觸事，從事能生於理，故名為句，即是句偈依，世句偈法以名字說。	As for the Dharma phrases, it means first touching on the phenomena, and from the phenomena one is able to give rise to the principle. Therefore, it is called a phrase, which is the basis for verses. Using names and phrases, it explains the Dharma of the world's phrases and verses.
['ZH_T39_1796_011:0691a20_17']	滿足者，入此法門能生法門，能生法界無相如來自證祕密之法，將欲以如是法滿足一切眾生，令無空過故也。	滿足者，入此法門能生法門，能生法界無相如來自證祕密之法，將欲以如是法滿足一切眾生，令無空過故也。	As for being complete, entering this Dharma gate is able to give rise to the Dharma gate and give rise to the Dharma realm of the self-realized secret Dharma of the formless Tathāgata.

This is the Dharma of the great emptiness and direct realization of the Buddhas.

['ZH_T39_1796_011:0691a27_15']	以如是即彼大空，無為亦無自性故，能生一切智智，即是巧智，智之異名也。	以如是即彼大空，無為亦無自性故，能生一切智智，即是巧智，智之異名也。	Because this great emptiness is also without self-nature, it is able to give rise to omniscience, which is a different name for skillful wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1796_011:0691b01_16']	若非巧智，豈能隨一切眾生種種心行，見其所樂見身，說其所宜聞法，稱其得解之機，皆悉不虛而入一切平等法界，即是巧中之極巧也。	若非巧智，豈能隨一切眾生種種心行，見其所樂見身，說其所宜聞法，稱其得解之機，皆悉不虛而入一切平等法界，即是巧中之極巧也。	If it were not skillful wisdom, how could it accord with the various mental activities of all sentient beings, manifest the body that they wish to see, speak the Dharma that they should hear, and accord with their capacity for understanding, all without falsehood, and enter the Dharma realm of equality? This is the ultimate skillfulness within skillfulness.
['ZH_T39_1796_011:0691b03_14']	以平等空亦無自性，有相生滅亦復無性，故於法自在能生巧智，普與一切眾生之願。	以平等空亦無自性，有相生滅亦復無性，故於法自在能生巧智，普與一切眾生之願。	Because equality and emptiness also have no self-nature, and the arising and ceasing of characteristics also have no nature, therefore, one is able to freely generate skillful wisdom in accord with the wishes of all sentient beings.

['ZH_T39_1796_011:0691b17_12']	如一切世間皆依於空而得安住，而此大空更無所依，不作是念：	如一切世間皆依於空而得安住，而此大空更無所依，不作是念：	Just as all worlds in the cosmos are based on space and can abide, yet this great emptiness has no further basis, and does not think:
