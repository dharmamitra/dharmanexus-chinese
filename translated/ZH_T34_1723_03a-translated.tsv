['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694b25_16']	一者依八品為正宗中，蓮華有出水、開敷之二德，妙法具果秀、行竦之兩能。	一者依八品為正宗中，蓮華有出水、開敷之二德，妙法具果秀、行竦之兩能。	First, among the eight chapters that are the main body, the lotus has the two virtues of emerging from the water and blooming, while the wonderful Dharma has the two abilities of bearing fruit and upright practice.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694b28_1']	又經下言今此經中唯說一乘，故以破二、會二歸於一乘為法華之正主，故三周說逗彼三根。	又經下言今此經中唯說一乘，故以破二、會二歸於一乘為法華之正主，故三周說逗彼三根。	Moreover, the sutra says below that in this sutra only the One Vehicle is taught, therefore, breaking the two and reconciling the two into the One Vehicle is the main theme of the Lotus Sutra, thus the three periods of teaching correspond to those three capacities.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c01_10']	此品初說一乘為利鶖子，鶖子上根最初於〈譬喻品〉中領解，佛為述成授記，乃至天子說偈竟，是第一周。	此品初說一乘為利鶖子，鶖子上根最初於〈譬喻品〉中領解，佛為述成授記，乃至天子說偈竟，是第一周。	At the beginning of this chapter, the One Vehicle is taught for the sake of Śāriputra. Śāriputra, of the highest capacity, first understood in the Parable Chapter. The Buddha explained it for him and gave him a prediction, up to the end of the verse spoken by the celestial sons, this is the first period.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c04_9']	〈譬喻品〉中舍利弗請，我今無復疑悔下，佛說譬喻利彼中根，中根四人信解佛說，〈藥草喻品〉為重述成，便為授記，是第二周。	〈譬喻品〉中舍利弗請，我今無復疑悔下，佛說譬喻利彼中根，中根四人信解佛說，〈藥草喻品〉為重述成，便為授記，是第二周。	In the Parable Chapter, Shariputra requests, I now have no more doubts or regrets. Below this, the Buddha uses parables to benefit those of middling faculties. The four people of middling faculties understand the Buddha's teachings. The Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter restates and affirms this, and then bestows predictions, which is the second cycle.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c06_14']	〈化城喻品〉說往結緣化城不實，利彼下根，滿慈子領、佛印述訖，便授五百及學無學記，是第三周。	〈化城喻品〉說往結緣化城不實，利彼下根，滿慈子領、佛印述訖，便授五百及學無學記，是第三周。	The City of the Dharma Chapter explains the past formation of karmic bonds and the unreality of the city of the Dharma, benefiting those of lower faculties. Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra leads and the Buddha affirms and describes this, and then bestows predictions to the five hundred and those in training and no longer in training, which is the third cycle.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c07_13']	自下更無說一乘處，故但一乘是法華體。	自下更無說一乘處，故但一乘是法華體。	Below this, there is no more explanation of the One Vehicle, so the One Vehicle is the essence of the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c09_20']	今既眾集緣和警之已畢，機器符會正可陳宗，且法說一乘利上根性，故〈序品〉後〈方便品〉來。	今既眾集緣和警之已畢，機器符會正可陳宗，且法說一乘利上根性，故〈序品〉後〈方便品〉來。	Now that the assembly has gathered and the conditions are harmonious, the alert ones have already completed their tasks. The spiritual capacities of the assembly are in accord, and it is appropriate to present the main point. First, the teaching of the One Vehicle benefits those of superior faculties, so after the Introduction Chapter comes the Skillful Means Chapter.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c14_5']	二者依十九品為正宗中，〈方便品〉下初十二品明一乘境，〈安樂〉、〈涌出〉明一乘行，〈如來壽量〉至〈常不輕〉合此五品明一乘果，說境令知乘之權實，勸應捨權而取於實，聲聞悟此遂便得記。	二者依十九品為正宗中，〈方便品〉下初十二品明一乘境，〈安樂〉、〈涌出〉明一乘行，〈如來壽量〉至〈常不輕〉合此五品明一乘果，說境令知乘之權實，勸應捨權而取於實，聲聞悟此遂便得記。	Second, based on the nineteen chapters as the main body, the first twelve chapters below the chapter on skillful means clarify the realm of the One Vehicle. The chapters on peace and joy and the emergence of the earth clarify the practice of the One Vehicle. The chapters on the lifespan of the Tathagata up to the chapter on the constant lack of disrespect combine these five chapters to clarify the fruition of the One Vehicle. Explaining the realm causes understanding of the provisional and real of the vehicle, encouraging the abandonment of the provisional and taking up the real. The shravakas awakened to this and thus were able to receive the prediction.

['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c16_16']	後〈持〉一品稟命捨權持行實法。	後〈持〉一品稟命捨權持行實法。	The last chapter on upholding the precepts稟命捨權持行實法.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c17_18']	科初八品與前無別，故〈序品〉後〈方便品〉來。	科初八品與前無別，故〈序品〉後〈方便品〉來。	The division of the first eight chapters is no different from the previous, so the chapter on skillful means comes after the chapter on the introduction.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c18_1']	三者論云：	三者論云：	Third, the treatise says:
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c19_17']	「自此已下示現所說因果相，此意從前〈序品〉之後，明經宗旨所說因果體相相狀。	「自此已下示現所說因果相，此意從前〈序品〉之後，明經宗旨所說因果體相相狀。	From here below, it shows the characteristics of the cause and effect that are spoken of. This meaning is after the Preface Chapter, clarifying the essence and characteristics of the cause and effect that are spoken of in the main purport of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c20_2']	」此有三釋：	」此有三釋：	 There are three explanations for this:
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c22_19']	一云所說諸佛智慧為果，能詮智慧教門名因，如門為入室之所由，故教為顯理之處，蓮華但說二義因、果，故即智、詮。	一云所說諸佛智慧為果，能詮智慧教門名因，如門為入室之所由，故教為顯理之處，蓮華但說二義因、果，故即智、詮。	One says that the wisdom of all buddhas is the effect that is spoken of, and the teaching that is able to expound wisdom is called the cause. It is like a gate being the means by which one enters a room, so the teaching is the place by which the principle is revealed. The two meanings of the lotus flower only speak of wisdom and the expounding.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0694c28_3']	二云三請已後明一大事，開、示、悟、入，前三為果、後一為因，正是一乘之宗旨，初揚智門之意，欲發鶖子等疑，令其固請說一乘故，蓮華二義雖解《無量義經》，果秀因開，此亦未爽通理，由此即以開示悟入為果及因。	二云三請已後明一大事，開、示、悟、入，前三為果、後一為因，正是一乘之宗旨，初揚智門之意，欲發鶖子等疑，令其固請說一乘故，蓮華二義雖解《無量義經》，果秀因開，此亦未爽通理，由此即以開示悟入為果及因。	Two, after the three requests, it clarifies the one great matter, opening, revealing, understanding, and entering. The first three are the effect and the last one is the cause. This is precisely the main purport of the one vehicle. The initial raising of the meaning of the gate of wisdom intends to arouse doubts in Śāriputra and the others, causing them to firmly request the expounding of the one vehicle. Therefore, although the two meanings of the lotus flower understand the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, with the effect blooming and the cause opening, this also does not go against the comprehensive principle. Based on this, it takes opening, revealing, understanding, and entering as the effect and cause.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695a03_9']	三云初智及門，門因智果，開示悟入三果入因，教、理、行、果俱法華故，令識昔者教行方便說三，今談乘體理果唯一，聽三乘之教、解一乘之理，行三乘之因、證一乘之果，法華意也。	三云初智及門，門因智果，開示悟入三果入因，教、理、行、果俱法華故，令識昔者教行方便說三，今談乘體理果唯一，聽三乘之教、解一乘之理，行三乘之因、證一乘之果，法華意也。	The third says: The initial wisdom and the gate, the gate is the cause of wisdom and the fruit of wisdom. The three fruits of opening, revealing, and entering are the causes of entering. Teaching, principle, practice, and fruition are all the Lotus Sutra, causing one to recognize the expedient teachings and practices of the past that speak of three, and now discussing the essence of the vehicle, the principle of the fruition is only one. Listening to the teachings of the three vehicles, understanding the principle of the one vehicle, practicing the causes of the three vehicles, and realizing the fruition of the one vehicle is the meaning of the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695a04_21']	如前已釋，此品具明經所說宗因之與果，故〈序品〉後〈方便品〉來。	如前已釋，此品具明經所說宗因之與果，故〈序品〉後〈方便品〉來。	As explained above, this chapter fully clarifies the essence and cause of what is spoken in the sutra, and therefore the chapter on skillful means comes after the introductory chapter.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695a05_15']	釋名者，「便」方連反，今為去音。	釋名者，「便」方連反，今為去音。	As for explaining the name, convenient is pronounced as fang lian in the present, but is used as a departing tone.

It is called actual wisdom because it is opposed to the false wisdom of ordinary beings that does not know it. Both the fundamental wisdom and the subsequently acquired wisdom are this.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695a11_4']	二證真實智，唯正體智，此有五對：	二證真實智，唯正體智，此有五對：	The second is the wisdom that realizes the truth, which is only the wisdom of the essence of suchness. This has five pairs:
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695a14_11']	一對知妄名實智，二對知事名實智，三對知相名實智，四對知詮名實智，此之四種實智皆是唯觀第四真智，餘四所對如次皆是四世俗智。	一對知妄名實智，二對知事名實智，三對知相名實智，四對知詮名實智，此之四種實智皆是唯觀第四真智，餘四所對如次皆是四世俗智。	The first is opposed to the false knowledge and is called actual wisdom. The second is opposed to the knowledge of phenomena and is called actual wisdom. The third is opposed to the knowledge of characteristics and is called actual wisdom. The fourth is opposed to the knowledge of the expressed and is called actual wisdom. These four kinds of actual wisdom are all the wisdom that only observes the fourth true wisdom. The other four that are opposed are the four conventional wisdoms in sequence.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695a16_12']	五對知權智名實智，謂一乘理、智，對知二權智，此依證智以第四真智對後三俗智；	五對知權智名實智，謂一乘理、智，對知二權智，此依證智以第四真智對後三俗智；	The fifth is opposed to the knowledge of expedient wisdom and is called actual wisdom. That is, the principle and wisdom of the One Vehicle are opposed to the knowledge of the two expedient wisdoms. This is based on the wisdom of realization, using the fourth true wisdom to oppose the latter three conventional wisdoms.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695a17_12']	若依趣入智，以第三真智對第三俗智。	若依趣入智，以第三真智對第三俗智。	If it is based on the wisdom of entry, it uses the third true wisdom to oppose the third conventional wisdom.

['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695b16_4']	三意方便，下云「尋念過去佛所行方便力，我今所得道亦應說三乘」等，是上同古佛下順有情。	三意方便，下云「尋念過去佛所行方便力，我今所得道亦應說三乘」等，是上同古佛下順有情。	Third, mental expedient means, as the sutra below says, Contemplating the expedient powers practiced by the buddhas of the past, the path I have now attained should also be taught as the three vehicles, and so on, which is above the same as the ancient buddhas and below in accord with sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695b17_4']	《佛地經》云「成所作智起三業化」，正與此同。	《佛地經》云「成所作智起三業化」，正與此同。	The Buddha-bhumi-sutra says, The wisdom of accomplishing what is to be done gives rise to the transformation of the three karmas, which is exactly the same as this.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695b18_4']	依此解云，施為可則曰方，善逗機宜曰便。	依此解云，施為可則曰方，善逗機宜曰便。	Relying on this explanation, giving that is suitable is called method, and skillfully adapting to the capacities of beings is called expedient.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0695b19_16']	《往生論》云「正直曰方，外已為便」，方是方術，便謂穩便，便之方名方便。	《往生論》云「正直曰方，外已為便」，方是方術，便謂穩便，便之方名方便。	The Treatise on Rebirth says, Upright is called method, and beyond is called expedient.

Because there are no skillful means, one is bound. This sūtra says below, I set up this skillful means to enable entry into the Buddha's wisdom. All tathāgatas use immeasurable skillful means to deliver all beings. Because the initial establishment of skillful means reveals the Buddha's wisdom later, it is the skillful means of giving among the four skillful means. The wonderful principle that can be followed is called method, and the skillful use that can reveal is called expedient.

['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0696c08_4']	二為諸聲聞迴向大菩提故，令其發心趣大果故。	二為諸聲聞迴向大菩提故，令其發心趣大果故。	Second, it is for the sake of the śrāvakas turning toward great enlightenment. It is to cause them to give rise to the aspiration and pursue the great fruition.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0696c11_6']	三護諸聲聞恐怯弱故，若告菩薩即諸聲聞謂此一乘非為已分，心生怯弱不能進脩，今告聲聞令除此意，是汝等分除怯弱心。	三護諸聲聞恐怯弱故，若告菩薩即諸聲聞謂此一乘非為已分，心生怯弱不能進脩，今告聲聞令除此意，是汝等分除怯弱心。	Third, to protect the śrāvakas from being timid and weak. If the Buddha were to tell only the bodhisattvas, the śrāvakas would think that this One Vehicle is not for them, and they would become timid and weak, unable to cultivate. Now, by telling the śrāvakas to remove this attitude, it is said, This is your share, remove your timid and weak mind.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0696c13_16']	四為令餘人善思念故，令餘聲聞善思念之，其舍利弗已蒙佛告，我是彼流亦應被告，深生信仰起脩學心。	四為令餘人善思念故，令餘聲聞善思念之，其舍利弗已蒙佛告，我是彼流亦應被告，深生信仰起脩學心。	Fourth, to cause others to think well. It is said to cause the other śrāvakas to think well, that Śāriputra has already been told by the Buddha, and that they are also in his lineage and should be told, deeply giving rise to faith and the mind to cultivate and study.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0696c16_10']	五為諸聲聞不起所作已辦心故，昔諸聲聞謂所得滅果滿證圓所作已辦，今歎法妙告彼不知，令捨小心。	五為諸聲聞不起所作已辦心故，昔諸聲聞謂所得滅果滿證圓所作已辦，今歎法妙告彼不知，令捨小心。	Fifth, to cause the śrāvakas not to give rise to the mind that thinks their task is already accomplished. In the past, the śrāvakas thought that their attainment of cessation was complete and perfect, and that their task was already accomplished. Now, praising the subtlety of the Dharma and telling them that they do not know, it causes them to abandon the small mind.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0696c19_8']	菩薩於五事全不相應，故雖利根佛不正告，傍告無爽，告三乘人有疑悔者令皆斷故，正告不定性兼任持所餘故。	菩薩於五事全不相應，故雖利根佛不正告，傍告無爽，告三乘人有疑悔者令皆斷故，正告不定性兼任持所餘故。	Bodhisattvas are completely unsuited to these five matters, and therefore, although they have sharp faculties, the Buddha does not directly tell them. Indirectly telling them is not wrong, because it causes those of the Three Vehicles who have doubts and regrets to all be eliminated. Directly telling those of indeterminate nature also benefits those who are entrusted with the remainder.

The essence of this cognition is both nature and characteristics, and is called all kinds. It refers to nirvana and bodhi in the stage of Buddhahood, or the non-discriminating cognition of one who has all cognition. The repeated word cognition refers to subsequent cognition. Meaning refers to the object, which is the object of the cognition of all kinds and all aspects, and is therefore called the meaning of the cognition of all kinds and all aspects.

The categories of dharmas are numerous and not one, and are called all kinds because they encompass everything. It means that all these kinds are the object of the cognition of all kinds and all aspects. This very object of all kinds is called the wisdom that is to be expounded.

The following says, The knowledge and insight of skillful means are all already complete. Exhausting thought together cannot fathom the Buddha's wisdom, and so forth.

The profundity of the scriptures is the three teachings of the past, therefore the profundity of realization is the essence of the One Vehicle, and the profundity of the unsurpassed is the great enlightenment. Therefore, the Shurangama Sutra says The essence of the One Vehicle is only true suchness, which is the treasure place of the chapter on the illusory city.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0697a28_10']	今此經中依實勝慧，唯取智性智相為體，菩提菩提斷皆名菩提，智及智處皆名般若，攝一切故。	今此經中依實勝慧，唯取智性智相為體，菩提菩提斷皆名菩提，智及智處皆名般若，攝一切故。	Now, in this sutra, based on true wisdom, it only takes wisdom and the characteristics of wisdom as its essence.

The gate of wisdom is the provisional teachings of the Three Vehicles. It generally indicates the two differences between the truth and the provisional, principle and teaching, wishing to cause the Two Vehicles to abandon the provisional and take the real, practice the cause, and realize the effect. Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says that the final nirvāṇa of the four wisdoms of the Two Vehicles and so forth is the skillful means of the Buddha, wishing to cause them to abandon the two provisional and take the one real.

As for immeasurability, the nature of wisdom, the characteristics of wisdom, the companions of wisdom, and the objects of wisdom are respectively the essence that is all-pervading, the vast function, the complete virtues, and the extensive dharmas, which are like space, limitless, and the number of virtues is endless, and will certainly never come to an end, therefore it is called immeasurable.

['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a02_12']	「所以者何」者，佛所得法所謂解脫，三乘同坐解脫之床，二乘亦得，方便言教亦已依學，如何今說此之二種，二乘不知不見。	「所以者何」者，佛所得法所謂解脫，三乘同坐解脫之床，二乘亦得，方便言教亦已依學，如何今說此之二種，二乘不知不見。	Why is it so? The Dharma attained by the Buddha is called liberation. The three vehicles sit together on the bed of liberation. The two vehicles also attain it. The expedient teachings have already been relied upon and studied. How is it that these two kinds are now said to be unknown and unseen by the two vehicles?
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a03_17']	又此徵意，佛之智慧二乘未得，可名甚深其智慧門；	又此徵意，佛之智慧二乘未得，可名甚深其智慧門；	Moreover, the meaning of this inquiry is that the wisdom of the Buddha is not yet attained by the two vehicles, so it can be called the profound wisdom gate;
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a04_14']	二乘已得，何名甚深，云二乘不知？	二乘已得，何名甚深，云二乘不知？	since the two vehicles have already attained it, why is it called profound, and why is it said that the two vehicles do not know it?
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a08_16']	若依初解所以者何，所得解脫三乘雖同，般若、法身，相、性智慧，彼所未得，汝定不知，且智慧門彼亦未了，故此以下但解阿含八種甚深，欲顯二乘尚不能知教之甚深，況佛智慧。	若依初解所以者何，所得解脫三乘雖同，般若、法身，相、性智慧，彼所未得，汝定不知，且智慧門彼亦未了，故此以下但解阿含八種甚深，欲顯二乘尚不能知教之甚深，況佛智慧。	If based on the first understanding, the reason is that although the liberation attained by the three vehicles is the same, the prajñā, dharmakāya, characteristics, nature, and wisdom are not yet attained by them, and you definitely do not know them. Moreover, the wisdom gate is also not yet understood by them. Therefore, what follows below only explains the eight kinds of profundity of the scriptures, wanting to show that the two vehicles are still unable to know the profundity of the teachings, let alone the Buddha's wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a10_12']	依第二解所以者何，前徵教門深所以者，今當具顯，故此已下但顯教深。	依第二解所以者何，前徵教門深所以者，今當具顯，故此已下但顯教深。	Based on the second understanding, the reason for the previous inquiry into the profundity of the teaching gate is now going to be fully revealed, so what follows below only reveals the profundity of the teachings.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a17_10']	論牒經有八句，今此文唯六句，准論應言，佛曾親近百千萬億無數諸佛，盡行諸佛無量道法，勇猛精進名稱普聞，成就甚深未曾有法，難解法者如來能知，隨宜所說，意趣難解，一切聲聞，辟支佛所不能知，加今經中第六句難解法者如來能知，加第八句一切聲聞、辟支佛所不能知，故成八深。	論牒經有八句，今此文唯六句，准論應言，佛曾親近百千萬億無數諸佛，盡行諸佛無量道法，勇猛精進名稱普聞，成就甚深未曾有法，難解法者如來能知，隨宜所說，意趣難解，一切聲聞，辟支佛所不能知，加今經中第六句難解法者如來能知，加第八句一切聲聞、辟支佛所不能知，故成八深。	The treatise summarizes the sutra with eight phrases, but this text only has six phrases. According to the treatise, it should say, The Buddha has closely attended hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of innumerable buddhas, practiced the immeasurable teachings of the buddhas, his heroic effort and fame are universally renowned, he has accomplished the profound and unprecedented teachings, the Tathāgata is able to understand the teachings that are difficult to understand, and the meaning he expounds according to the capacities of beings is difficult to fathom, this is not something that all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can know. The sixth phrase in the present sutra, the Tathāgata is able to understand the teachings that are difficult to understand, and the eighth phrase, this is not something that all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can know, are added, thus making eight profundities.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a21_13']	第一句佛曾親近百千萬億無數諸佛者受持讀誦甚深，此顯世尊經三大劫供養二十六恒河沙佛，於彼諸佛所受持讀誦此法門故，所以甚深，非如彼二乘略即能解，故名甚深。	第一句佛曾親近百千萬億無數諸佛者受持讀誦甚深，此顯世尊經三大劫供養二十六恒河沙佛，於彼諸佛所受持讀誦此法門故，所以甚深，非如彼二乘略即能解，故名甚深。	The first phrase the Buddha has personally approached hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of innumerable buddhas refers to the profundity of upholding and reciting [the sūtra]. This shows that the World-Honored One, over the course of three great eons, made offerings to buddhas equal to the sands of twenty-six Ganges Rivers. He upheld and recited this Dharma door in the presence of those buddhas, and therefore it is profound. It is not like the two vehicles that can understand it briefly, and therefore it is called profound.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a24_8']	第二句盡行諸佛無量道法者，脩行甚深，諸佛福智二利道行皆盡行故，非如二乘略脩因故，名為甚深，下皆准知。	第二句盡行諸佛無量道法者，脩行甚深，諸佛福智二利道行皆盡行故，非如二乘略脩因故，名為甚深，下皆准知。	The second phrase fully practicing the immeasurable path of the buddhas refers to the profundity of cultivation. This is because he fully practiced the path of merit and wisdom of the buddhas, the two kinds of benefits, and therefore it is profound. It is not like the two vehicles that cultivate the causes briefly, and therefore it is called profound. The following should be understood in the same way.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698a28_14']	第三句勇猛精進者，果行甚深，果謂果決，精純勇捍堪耐勞倦所作皆成名為果決，或由精進所作善成，今獲勝果名果甚深，一句投火半偈捨身，六年苦行七日翹足，非不專精懃勞得故。	第三句勇猛精進者，果行甚深，果謂果決，精純勇捍堪耐勞倦所作皆成名為果決，或由精進所作善成，今獲勝果名果甚深，一句投火半偈捨身，六年苦行七日翹足，非不專精懃勞得故。	As for the third phrase courageous and diligent, it refers to the profundity of fruition practice. Fruition means the determination of fruition. Being pure, courageous, and able to endure fatigue, all that is done is accomplished, which is called the determination of fruition. Alternately, due to diligence, what is done is accomplished well, and now one attains the supreme fruition, which is called the profundity of fruition. Reciting a single verse and casting oneself into the fire, practicing austerities for six years and standing on tiptoe for seven days, are not without single-minded diligence and hard work, and thus are attained.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b03_12']	第四句名稱普聞者，增長功德心甚深，由名遠振凡聖普聞，勗勵已身懃加脩斷，自功德心倍加增長，或名遠振他聞之故，皆悉增長功德之心，一切聞知故成甚深。	第四句名稱普聞者，增長功德心甚深，由名遠振凡聖普聞，勗勵已身懃加脩斷，自功德心倍加增長，或名遠振他聞之故，皆悉增長功德之心，一切聞知故成甚深。	As for the fourth phrase with fame heard far and wide, it refers to the profundity of the mind of increasing merit and virtue. Due to the far-reaching fame, ordinary beings and sages all hear of it. Encouraging oneself, one diligently practices and cuts off [delusions]. The mind of one's own merit and virtue greatly increases. Alternately, due to the far-reaching fame heard by others, they all increase the mind of merit and virtue. Because all hear and know of it, it becomes profound.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b06_6']	第五句成就甚深未曾有法者，快妙事心甚深，由所成法是未曾有快妙勝事，能成之心亦為快妙，快妙心說故教難知。	第五句成就甚深未曾有法者，快妙事心甚深，由所成法是未曾有快妙勝事，能成之心亦為快妙，快妙心說故教難知。	The fifth sentence, accomplishing the profound and unprecedented dharmas, refers to the profundity of the mind of delight and wonder, because the accomplished dharmas are unprecedented, delightful, and marvelous, and the accomplishing mind is also delightful. Because it is taught with a delightful mind, the teaching is difficult to know.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b08_5']	第六句難解法者，如來能知者無上甚深，由極難解法如來能知，故此法門得成無上；	第六句難解法者，如來能知者無上甚深，由極難解法如來能知，故此法門得成無上；	The sixth sentence, the Tathāgata is able to know the difficult-to-understand dharmas, refers to the unsurpassed profundity, because the Tathāgata is able to know the extremely difficult-to-understand dharmas, and therefore this Dharma door becomes unsurpassed;
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b09_6']	或難解法體即無上，唯佛能知，故是甚深。	或難解法體即無上，唯佛能知，故是甚深。	Or the essence of the difficult-to-understand dharmas is itself unsurpassed, and only the Buddha is able to know them, and therefore they are profound.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b12_12']	第七句隨宜所說意趣難解者，入甚深，入甚深者名字章句意難得故，佛自住持入解此意，不同外道自不能解何令他解，說因緣法極甚深故。	第七句隨宜所說意趣難解者，入甚深，入甚深者名字章句意難得故，佛自住持入解此意，不同外道自不能解何令他解，說因緣法極甚深故。	The seventh sentence, the meaning of the teachings given according to circumstances is difficult to understand, refers to the profundity of entering, because the meaning of the names, phrases, and sentences is difficult to grasp. The Buddha himself abides in and enters into understanding this meaning, unlike the non-Buddhists who are themselves unable to understand and would have others understand. Because the causal and conditional teachings are extremely profound.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b12_17']	入有二義：	入有二義：	There are two meanings of entering:
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b14_10']	一難入解佛自解故，二隨宜所說令他入法故，意趣難解名為甚深。	一難入解佛自解故，二隨宜所說令他入法故，意趣難解名為甚深。	First, it is difficult for others to understand because it is understood by the Buddha himself. Second, it is taught according to the capacities of beings so that others may enter the Dharma. The meaning that is difficult to understand is called profound.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b17_5']	第八句一切聲聞辟支佛所不能知者，不共聲聞、辟支佛所作住持甚深，不同二乘所作外利所作、內利住持故成甚深。	第八句一切聲聞辟支佛所不能知者，不共聲聞、辟支佛所作住持甚深，不同二乘所作外利所作、內利住持故成甚深。	The eighth sentence, All śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are unable to know it, refers to the profundity of the support that is not shared by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. It is different from the support that is created externally by the two vehicles and the support that is created internally. Therefore, it is profound.
['ZH_T34_1723_03a:0698b21_4']	上來總說，由近諸佛，受持、讀誦、脩行、果決、增長功德心、證快妙事、成無上法、故隨宜說、難可得解、二乘不了，其智慧門名為甚深難解入故，況佛智慧非甚深哉！	上來總說，由近諸佛，受持、讀誦、脩行、果決、增長功德心、證快妙事、成無上法、故隨宜說、難可得解、二乘不了，其智慧門名為甚深難解入故，況佛智慧非甚深哉！	The above is a general explanation. Because of being close to the buddhas, upholding, reciting, practicing, determining the fruits, increasing meritorious mind, realizing wonderful things, accomplishing the unsurpassed Dharma, therefore teaching according to capacities, being difficult to understand, and the two vehicles not comprehending, the wisdom gate is called profound and difficult to understand and enter. How much more so is the Buddha's wisdom not profound?

According to the Abhidharma, For one who has long cultivated the practice, who has already subdued and eliminated the notion of form based on the formless concentration, the notion of formlessness appears before the one who sees, and one contemplates external form as having little or much, etc., unlike the initial contemplation of both internal and external form as all being light, due to lack of mastery.

This means that the observation of external form does not rely on the formless concentrations, because the formless concentrations are unable to take external form as objects. Or, having already become free from desire for the form realm, one does not rely on the formless concentrations to subdue and eliminate the conception of form.
