The flow of appreciation returns to one, and the profound ford is rippled in the cut-off. How could it not be that the mind is led to enlightenment upon encountering it, and doubts are dispelled through events?
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a08_7']	疑繁而誨自廣、悟初而訪逾篤，所以重指鷲阿、再扣龍眾。	疑繁而誨自廣、悟初而訪逾篤，所以重指鷲阿、再扣龍眾。	Doubts are many, and the teachings become extensive. Enlightenment is initial, and the search becomes increasingly earnest. Therefore, the Vulture Peak is pointed to again, and the dragon assembly is knocked again.

When the assembly of those with the forbearance of the Dharma is foremost, Subhūti is at the head. Then, the region is shaken to show warning, and obstacles are cleared away to reveal the strict. The tongue covers the great trichiliocosm, and the body divides into countless parts. The light spreads the compassionate shadow, and the six destinies are moistened with harmony. The voice carries the Dharma words, and the ten directions are moved by the news. Having been startled by the extraordinary view, they now long for the secret.

['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a13_7']	徇蠡管之察，是病高深；	徇蠡管之察，是病高深；	Following the perception of a small tube is a disease of the lofty and profound;

['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a14_9']	夫以淺定微術，猶擅五通；	夫以淺定微術，猶擅五通；	As for shallow concentration and minor techniques, they still dominate the five supernatural powers;
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a14_19']	小善片言，實應千里。	小善片言，實應千里。	Small goodness and brief words, truly respond to a thousand li.
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a15_9']	況挻孕群品、彈壓眾靈；	況挻孕群品、彈壓眾靈；	How much more so for nurturing all beings and suppressing the myriad spirits;
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a15_19']	萬期一會，窮冥極遠。	萬期一會，窮冥極遠。	The myriad periods gather in one assembly, exhausting the profound and reaching the distant.
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a17_12']	是使微塵剎土不動而遊、恒沙諸佛不謀而證，非般若至賾其孰能致此。	是使微塵剎土不動而遊、恒沙諸佛不謀而證，非般若至賾其孰能致此。	This causes the lands of dust-motes to travel without moving, and the buddhas of the Ganges sands to realize without scheming. If not for the utmost profundity of prajñā, who could accomplish this?
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a19_9']	是用十空瑩曬、七如朗聽，雖惱趣森橫、寂岸層逈，莫不同幻蕊之開落，不滅不生；	是用十空瑩曬、七如朗聽，雖惱趣森橫、寂岸層逈，莫不同幻蕊之開落，不滅不生；	Thus, the ten emptinesses shine brightly, and the seven suchnesses are clearly heard. Although the realms of afflictions are vast and the shore of tranquility is distant, they are all like opening and falling illusory petals, neither ceasing nor arising;
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a20_1']	比夢象之妍媸，無染無淨。	比夢象之妍媸，無染無淨。	Like the beautiful and ugly images in a dream, without defilement or purity.
['ZH_T07_0220c_001:0001a21_12']	飈谷投響則譽毀共銷，月池寖色則物我俱謝，文優理詣，感通悟永。	飈谷投響則譽毀共銷，月池寖色則物我俱謝，文優理詣，感通悟永。	If the valley responds to sound, then praise and blame both disappear; if the moon's reflection gradually changes color, then self and other both fade away. The text is elegant and the principle is profound, touching and enlightening forever.

Comparing the brilliance of the two versions, how can it not be prosperous!
