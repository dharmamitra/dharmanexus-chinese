['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a07_3']	此品次〈方便品〉來者，為破無為緣集，成淨佛國之教。	此品次〈方便品〉來者，為破無為緣集，成淨佛國之教。	The reason this chapter comes after the Chapter on Skillful Means is to break down the conditioned arising of the unconditioned and accomplish the teaching of purifying the Buddha lands.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a07_18']	已如前說，其意乃多，非凡所測。	已如前說，其意乃多，非凡所測。	As explained above, its meaning is vast and cannot be fathomed by ordinary people.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a08_8']	今亦略用三意通釋此品：	今亦略用三意通釋此品：	Here, I will also briefly use three meanings to explain this chapter in general:
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a09_10']	一正明此品來意、二略釋弟子義、三入文解釋。	一正明此品來意、二略釋弟子義、三入文解釋。	1. Directly clarifying the reason for this chapter, 2. Briefly explaining the meaning of disciples, 3. Entering the text for interpretation.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a11_2']	初意者，大聖慈悲，欲令眾生得不思議正報解脫法身、依報淨佛國土。	初意者，大聖慈悲，欲令眾生得不思議正報解脫法身、依報淨佛國土。	As for the first meaning, the Great Sage's compassion wishes to enable sentient beings to attain the inconceivable correct retribution, the liberation of the Dharma body, and the pure Buddha lands as the dependent environment.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a13_11']	但以化物必在有緣，淨名於此忍土與物久結菩提勝業，懸知佛意，先因託疾種種說法，扶成解脫佛國之教。	但以化物必在有緣，淨名於此忍土與物久結菩提勝業，懸知佛意，先因託疾種種說法，扶成解脫佛國之教。	However, transforming beings must be based on those with karmic affinity. Vimalakīrti has long formed the supreme karmic affinity for enlightenment with the people of this Saha world. He keenly understands the Buddha's intention and, taking advantage of his illness, expounds the Dharma in various ways to support the teaching of liberation and the Buddha lands.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a15_11']	今復寢疾默念，意在如來大慈垂問，若顧命弟子，必辭往昔被彈之事，即得顯成如來所說。	今復寢疾默念，意在如來大慈垂問，若顧命弟子，必辭往昔被彈之事，即得顯成如來所說。	Now, lying sick, silently thinking, my intention is for the Tathāgata's great compassion to ask about him. If he entrusts his disciples, he will certainly speak of the matter of being refuted in the past, and will immediately be able to manifest what the Tathāgata has said.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a16_1']	今明來意，略出五重：	今明來意，略出五重：	Now, clarifying the intention, I briefly present five layers:
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a18_5']	一為顯淨名勝智、二為令四眾捨小慕大、三為扶成佛國、四為折伏二乘成生蘇教、五為印定成經。	一為顯淨名勝智、二為令四眾捨小慕大、三為扶成佛國、四為折伏二乘成生蘇教、五為印定成經。	First, to reveal the superior wisdom of Vimalakīrti; second, to cause the fourfold assembly to abandon the small and admire the great; third, to support and complete the Buddha-land; fourth, to subdue the two vehicles and accomplish the teaching of raw curd; fifth, to seal and determine the sūtra.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a19_18']	初意者，若命弟子，必述昔為辭，大眾若聞，即於淨名生莫測想，彌加敬從；	初意者，若命弟子，必述昔為辭，大眾若聞，即於淨名生莫測想，彌加敬從；	The first meaning is, if he entrusts his disciples, he will certainly speak of the matter of being refuted in the past. If the great assembly hears it, they will have an unfathomable thought about Vimalakīrti and will increase their respect and obedience;
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a20_16']	若深信內發，是則堪聞入室說淨土之教。	若深信內發，是則堪聞入室說淨土之教。	If deep faith arises within, then one is able to hear the teaching of the Pure Land spoken in the room.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a22_2']	第二意者，證果聲聞未能迴心，如高原陸地不生蓮華；	第二意者，證果聲聞未能迴心，如高原陸地不生蓮華；	The second meaning is, the Sravakas who have realized the fruit are unable to turn their minds, like lotus flowers not growing on high plains or dry land;
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a23_1']	未入位者雖樂小乘，聞被彈事必發大心。	未入位者雖樂小乘，聞被彈事必發大心。	Those who have not yet entered the stages, although they enjoy the Lesser Vehicle, upon hearing the matter of being refuted will certainly give rise to the great mind.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a25_9']	如說《大品》時有未入位者，捨受持衣供養如來即發大心，佛即放光仍為授記，亦通開發四眾大道利益無量。	如說《大品》時有未入位者，捨受持衣供養如來即發大心，佛即放光仍為授記，亦通開發四眾大道利益無量。	It is said that when the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra was being taught, there were those who had not yet entered the stages of spiritual development. They abandoned their robes and offerings to the Tathāgata and immediately gave rise to the great aspiration. The Buddha then emitted light and gave them predictions. This also universally inspired the fourfold assembly to cultivate the great path and benefited innumerable beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a25_12']	何者？	何者？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a28_13']	往昔彈斥聞者不多，如呵波離止二比丘心得清淨、如呵那律止是萬梵發菩提心，若至此席大眾普聞益乃無量，故須各述被彈之事。	往昔彈斥聞者不多，如呵波離止二比丘心得清淨、如呵那律止是萬梵發菩提心，若至此席大眾普聞益乃無量，故須各述被彈之事。	In the past, when reprimanded, not many people heard it. For example, when Śāriputra was reprimanded, only two bhikṣus attained purity of mind, and when Aniruddha was reprimanded, only ten thousand Brahmakāyika gods gave rise to the aspiration for enlightenment. If they were to hear this teaching, the great assembly would universally hear it and the benefits would be immeasurable. Therefore, each of them must recount the events of being reprimanded.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608a29_15']	第三意者，欲顯二乘昔日被呵與今當宗佛國意同。	第三意者，欲顯二乘昔日被呵與今當宗佛國意同。	The third meaning is to reveal that the reprimands of the two vehicles in the past are the same as the intention of the Buddha's land in the present teaching.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b01_2']	何以知然？	何以知然？	How can this be known?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b03_12']	眾生罪故不見淨土，如身子自述淨名往昔破其執小之失令各鄙小慕大，是則執小之罪漸除、慕大之心冥發。	眾生罪故不見淨土，如身子自述淨名往昔破其執小之失令各鄙小慕大，是則執小之罪漸除、慕大之心冥發。	Because of sentient beings' offenses, they do not see the Pure Land. As Śāriputra recounts, Subhūti in the past broke his attachment to the small vehicle and caused them to each despise the small and yearn for the great. This means that the offenses of clinging to the small are gradually removed and the mind yearning for the great is secretly aroused.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b05_17']	今得預此座、承佛神力，得聞此說情同五百，因得入室聞不思議，而燈王、香積無動之土皆現目前。	今得預此座、承佛神力，得聞此說情同五百，因得入室聞不思議，而燈王、香積無動之土皆現目前。	Now, having been able to attend this assembly and receive the Buddha's spiritual power, I have heard this teaching and feel the same as the five hundred disciples. Because of this, I have been able to enter the room and hear the inconceivable, and the lands of the Lamp King, Fragrant Accumulation, and Akṣobhya have all appeared before my eyes.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b07_7', 'ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b08_15']	第四意者，如頓教初開但有大機，小根垢重於其無益，譬之如乳。🔽三藏次興，方便開三，小根之徒因斷見思隔凡成聖，即轉乳成酪。	第四意者，如頓教初開但有大機，小根垢重於其無益，譬之如乳。 三藏次興，方便開三，小根之徒因斷見思隔凡成聖，即轉乳成酪。	The fourth meaning is that when the sudden teaching was first opened, there were only those with great capacity. Those with shallow roots and heavy defilements were not benefited by it, like milk.🔽Next, the Tripiṭaka was established, and the three vehicles were provisionally opened. Those with shallow capacities then severed their views and thoughts, separated from the ordinary and attained the sacred, which is like turning milk into curd.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b10_12']	次聞往昔大士彈呵，乃至入室聲振三千，是則鄙小慕大、信心漸轉，事等生蘇。	次聞往昔大士彈呵，乃至入室聲振三千，是則鄙小慕大、信心漸轉，事等生蘇。	Next, hearing the reprimand of the great beings of the past, up to entering the room and the sound shaking the trichiliocosm, this means that those with shallow capacities despised the small and admired the great, and their faith gradually changed, which is like the process of making ghee.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b11_9']	故《法華》云「過是已後心相體信入出無難。	故《法華》云「過是已後心相體信入出無難。	Therefore, the Lotus Sūtra says, After this, their minds trusted each other and came and went without difficulty.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b12_14']	」若至《大品》變成熟蘇，入《法華》、《涅槃》即成醍醐。	」若至《大品》變成熟蘇，入《法華》、《涅槃》即成醍醐。	If they reached the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, it would transform and mature into ghee. Entering the Lotus Sūtra and Nirvāṇa Sūtra would then become ghee.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b13_4']	是則重述所彈，有成生蘇之由。	是則重述所彈，有成生蘇之由。	This then repeats what was refuted, and has the basis for the arising of the mature milk.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b13_6']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b14_16']	若五百各述顯淨名之德為入室生蘇之由者，此定屬序，非正說也。	若五百各述顯淨名之德為入室生蘇之由者，此定屬序，非正說也。	If the five hundred each describe the virtues of Vimalakīrti in order to serve as the basis for the arising of mature milk in the room, then this definitely belongs to the introduction, not to the main teaching.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b14_18']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b15_7']	若成生蘇，豈專入室？	若成生蘇，豈專入室？	If it serves to produce mature milk, how can it be limited to entering the room?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b18_12']	或是爾前聞諸方等，如央掘所彈，或昔彈時、或聞今重述、或至入室、或至在後說諸方等，如是等時皆成生蘇，豈得定為入室成生蘇之哢胤屬序分耶？	或是爾前聞諸方等，如央掘所彈，或昔彈時、或聞今重述、或至入室、或至在後說諸方等，如是等時皆成生蘇，豈得定為入室成生蘇之哢胤屬序分耶？	It may be that before this, they heard various vaipulya sūtras, like the reprimands in the Aṅgulimāla Sūtra, or when they were reprimanded in the past, or heard the repeated descriptions now, or when they entered the room, or when they heard the various vaipulya sūtras later. At these times, they all produced mature milk. How can it be said to definitely serve as the basis for producing mature milk by entering the room, and thus belong to the introductory section?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b19_19']	若以由蘇哢胤即是序者，入室為還菴園之由，亦即成序。	若以由蘇哢胤即是序者，入室為還菴園之由，亦即成序。	If it is said that the basis for producing mature milk is the introduction, then entering the room as the basis for returning to the garden would also be the introduction.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b22_12']	第五意者，淨名往昔隨物機動、隨處彈呵即便教謝，若不因命弟子，豈得大眾同聞，為如來印定，益正像末之四眾也。	第五意者，淨名往昔隨物機動、隨處彈呵即便教謝，若不因命弟子，豈得大眾同聞，為如來印定，益正像末之四眾也。	The fifth meaning is that Vimalakīrti, in the past, taught and apologized according to the movement of beings and the places to be reprimanded. If it were not for the disciples' request, how could the great assembly have heard it together, been certified by the Tathāgata, and benefited the four assemblies of the true, semblance, and latter ages?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b22_14']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b23_7']	此彈聲聞三觀四教各用其幾？	此彈聲聞三觀四教各用其幾？	How many of the three contemplations and four teachings are used in this reprimanding of the śrāvakas?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b23_9']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b23_14']	具用三觀。	具用三觀。	All three contemplations are used.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b24_12']	初彈從折空入假觀，用衍三教以彈三藏。	初彈從折空入假觀，用衍三教以彈三藏。	The initial reprimand uses the contemplation of breaking through emptiness and entering the provisional to use the three teachings of the Mahāyāna to reprimand the Tripiṭaka.

['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608b28_5']	一略釋弟子名義、二釋十弟子、三總對通心數、四別對十心數、五明莊嚴雙樹、六明生果報土、七明淨佛國土、八約觀心、九明遣問前後。	一略釋弟子名義、二釋十弟子、三總對通心數、四別對十心數、五明莊嚴雙樹、六明生果報土、七明淨佛國土、八約觀心、九明遣問前後。	First, a brief explanation of the meaning of the name disciple; second, an explanation of the ten disciples; third, a general correspondence with the mental factors; fourth, a specific correspondence with the ten mental factors; fifth, clarifying the adornment of the twin trees; sixth, clarifying the rebirth in the land of recompense; seventh, clarifying the purification of the Buddha lands; eighth, relating to the contemplation of the mind; ninth, clarifying the sending of questions in sequence.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c02_5']	初意者，夫師有匠成之能、學者有資稟之德，資則捨父從師敬師如父，師之謙讓處資如弟，故夫子云「回也處余如父，余也處回如弟。	初意者，夫師有匠成之能、學者有資稟之德，資則捨父從師敬師如父，師之謙讓處資如弟，故夫子云「回也處余如父，余也處回如弟。	The first meaning is that a teacher has the ability to mold and perfect, and a student has the virtue of receiving and inheriting. If one is a student, one abandons one's father and follows the teacher, respecting the teacher as a father. The teacher humbly treats the student as a younger brother. Therefore, Confucius said, Hui treats me as a father, and I treat Hui as a younger brother.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c03_6']	」今身子之徒從佛受學，即是師資，故名弟子。	」今身子之徒從佛受學，即是師資，故名弟子。	Now, the disciples such as Śāriputra follow the Buddha to receive teachings, which is the relationship between teacher and student, so they are called disciples.

['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c05_7']	佛是眾生之慈父，一切眾生皆是佛子，故《法華》云「今此三界皆是我有，其中眾生悉是吾子。	佛是眾生之慈父，一切眾生皆是佛子，故《法華》云「今此三界皆是我有，其中眾生悉是吾子。	The Buddha is the compassionate father of sentient beings, and all sentient beings are the Buddha's children. Therefore, the Lotus Sūtra says, Now, this threefold world is all mine, and the sentient beings within it are all my children.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c05_17']	」豈從夫子之所制立？	」豈從夫子之所制立？	How is this established according to Confucius?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c05_19']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c06_17']	經有二義，自有依理立名、自有順俗為目。	經有二義，自有依理立名、自有順俗為目。	There are two meanings in the sūtras. Some names are established based on principles, and some names follow worldly customs.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c08_5']	如《法華》云「我為太子時羅睺為長子，我今成佛道受法為法子。	如《法華》云「我為太子時羅睺為長子，我今成佛道受法為法子。	As the Lotus Sūtra says, When I was the crown prince, Rāhula was the eldest son. Now that I have attained Buddhahood, he receives the Dharma and becomes my Dharma son.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c09_1']	」此即約理，世間出世間皆是父子。	」此即約理，世間出世間皆是父子。	This is based on principle, where both the mundane and supramundane are father and son.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c10_15']	若順俗者，即如夫子，尋弘教門順俗無諍，而心不違實法，故依外義釋名無咎。	若順俗者，即如夫子，尋弘教門順俗無諍，而心不違實法，故依外義釋名無咎。	If one follows worldly customs, then it is like Confucius. In propagating the teachings and following worldly customs without dispute, one's mind does not contradict the true Dharma. Therefore, relying on the external meaning to explain the names is not wrong.

['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c13_10']	俗人雖復時來受道，既形居俗綱事親事君，豈能晨宵承奉常得資稟？	俗人雖復時來受道，既形居俗綱事親事君，豈能晨宵承奉常得資稟？	Although laypeople sometimes come to receive the Way, since they live in the world and serve their parents and rulers, how can they always attend and receive support morning and evening?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c14_10']	菩薩常以利物為懷，有機則赴不專佛邊。	菩薩常以利物為懷，有機則赴不專佛邊。	Bodhisattvas always keep benefiting beings in mind. When there is an opportunity, they respond and do not exclusively stay by the Buddha's side.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c15_17']	聲聞捨家為內眷屬，從聞生解事事資承，弟子之儀事理圓足。	聲聞捨家為內眷屬，從聞生解事事資承，弟子之儀事理圓足。	The śrāvakas leave the household life to become inner disciples. They give rise to understanding based on what they hear and serve in every way. The disciple's conduct and principles are completely fulfilled.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c17_12']	復次聲聞經中明五佛子五種得果，並不說菩薩，是以弟子之名偏屬聲聞；	復次聲聞經中明五佛子五種得果，並不說菩薩，是以弟子之名偏屬聲聞；	Furthermore, in the śrāvaka sūtras, it is explained that the five kinds of Buddha's disciples attain the five fruits, but it does not mention bodhisattvas. Therefore, the name of disciple is biased towards the śrāvakas;

['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c22_2']	一往與法華三根意同，唯迦旃延在富樓那後異耳。	一往與法華三根意同，唯迦旃延在富樓那後異耳。	In a general sense, it is the same as the three capacities in the Lotus Sutra, only Kātyāyana is after Pūrṇa, which is different.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0608c24_1']	但如來法王導三界，初開三藏必須輔翼，王此十聲聞互有所長，各掌一法助佛開化。	但如來法王導三界，初開三藏必須輔翼，王此十聲聞互有所長，各掌一法助佛開化。	But the Tathāgata, the Dharma King, guides the three realms, and when he first opens the Tripiṭaka, he must have assistants. These ten śrāvakas each have their own strengths and are in charge of one Dharma to assist the Buddha in opening up and transforming.

Now it is explained that not only does one enter up to the concentration of cessation in sequence, but also from the concentration of cessation one arises in sequence and exits from the non-thought up to the first meditation, and the power of concentration becomes increasingly superior.

Because the traces reveal the fundamental, one practices equality.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0616c06_5']	若迦葉破八邪入八脫，但得小乘法喜禪悅，此即捨邪取正，何得名為次第求於法喜禪悅？	若迦葉破八邪入八脫，但得小乘法喜禪悅，此即捨邪取正，何得名為次第求於法喜禪悅？	If Kāśyapa breaks the eight perversions and enters the eight liberations, he only attains the joy of the Dharma and the joy of meditation of the lesser vehicle. This is abandoning evil and taking up the correct. How can it be called seeking the joy of the Dharma and the joy of meditation in sequence?
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0616c08_2']	菩薩雖知法性真滅平等，能不捨八邪入八解脫，即是次第求於大乘法喜禪悅。	菩薩雖知法性真滅平等，能不捨八邪入八解脫，即是次第求於大乘法喜禪悅。	Although bodhisattvas know the true extinction and equality of the nature of dharmas, they are able to abandon the eight perversions and enter the eight liberations, which is precisely the sequential pursuit of the Dharma joy and meditation joy of the Great Vehicle.

Therefore, when the bodhisattva practices dhūta, the mind of great compassion and equality is like empty space, not discriminating between poverty and wealth, the mind is without rejection or acceptance, and one practices begging in sequence according to the rules of alms-gathering.

Second, in terms of breaking through by knowing suffering, precisely because the truth of suffering is the aggregates and sense bases of the body, one must beg for alms to sustain life and vitality.

If it is for not eating, then after seven days of not eating, he would enter nirvāṇa without remainder, and there would be no problem of eating and drinking.

Therefore, he must beg for food to sustain himself and cultivate the cause of non-eating. This is then without fault.
['ZH_T38_1778_004:0617a04_12']	若為化眾生令得不食之果，貧富俱往化世乞食，終不灰滅入不食之涅槃。	若為化眾生令得不食之果，貧富俱往化世乞食，終不灰滅入不食之涅槃。	If it is for transforming beings and causing them to attain the fruit of non-eating, then he goes to both the poor and the wealthy to transform the world by begging for food, and will never be extinguished and enter the nirvāṇa of non-eating.
