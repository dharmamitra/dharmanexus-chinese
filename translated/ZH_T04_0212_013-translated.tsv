One must set one's will and surely accomplish one's wishes. If one's mind desires good, one will surely accomplish good. If one's mind desires evil, one will surely accomplish evil.

The method of learning should exhaust the teacher's skills. Talents and skills in the six arts should all be fully equipped. It is like having battle equipment in a war. Firmly placing the feet, stabilizing the mind, and holding a bow and arrows in the hand, one will surely accomplish one's intentions according to one's direction, and obtain the family business and collect and store it.
