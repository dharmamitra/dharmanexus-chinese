Such observations are detachments from the five aggregates of the fourth dhyāna. Since the remaining aggregates follow form, it is said to only detach from form.

If each is distinguished, there is no eye. The parts such as earth, etc., are also like this.

['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a08_16']	眼是內入攝，四為外入攝，以是故不得以諸微塵為眼。	眼是內入攝，四為外入攝，以是故不得以諸微塵為眼。	002	Because the eye is categorized as an internal sense base, while the four are categorized as external sense bases. For this reason, one cannot take the various particles as the eye.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a09_16']	如佛說眾事和合見色假名為眼，無有定實；	如佛說眾事和合見色假名為眼，無有定實；	002	As the Buddha said, the seeing of form through the combination of various factors is provisionally called the eye. There is no definite reality.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a10_9']	耳鼻舌皮肉骨等亦如是破。	耳鼻舌皮肉骨等亦如是破。	002	The ear, nose, tongue, skin, flesh, bones, etc. are also like this in being refuted.

['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a13_9']	」能如是分別，是名離色。	」能如是分別，是名離色。	002	Being able to analyze in this way is called being apart from form.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a15_8']	復次如佛說，若比丘欲離色，度一切色相，滅一切對相，不念一切異相，入無量虛空處。	復次如佛說，若比丘欲離色，度一切色相，滅一切對相，不念一切異相，入無量虛空處。	002	Furthermore, as the Buddha said, if a bhikṣu wishes to be apart from form, transcend all characteristics of form, extinguish all characteristics of resistance, and not think of all different characteristics, he enters the stage of infinite space.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a15_20']	度一切色相者，是可見色；	度一切色相者，是可見色；	002	Transcending all forms refers to visible forms;

['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a20_16']	如是離一切色相，得入虛空處。	如是離一切色相，得入虛空處。	002	Thus, by being apart from all forms, one can enter the sphere of space.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a25_7']	復次行者繫心身內虛空，所謂口鼻咽喉、眼耳胸腹等，既知色為眾惱，空為無患，是故心樂虛空，若心在色攝令在空，心轉柔軟，令身中虛空漸漸廣大，自見色身如藕根孔，習之轉利，見身盡空無復有色。	復次行者繫心身內虛空，所謂口鼻咽喉、眼耳胸腹等，既知色為眾惱，空為無患，是故心樂虛空，若心在色攝令在空，心轉柔軟，令身中虛空漸漸廣大，自見色身如藕根孔，習之轉利，見身盡空無復有色。	002	Furthermore, the practitioner focuses the mind on the internal empty space of the body, namely the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, ears, chest, abdomen, etc. Knowing that form is a multitude of afflictions, and emptiness is free from troubles, the mind thus delights in emptiness. If the mind is in form, it is restrained and placed in emptiness. The mind becomes more pliable, causing the empty space in the body to gradually expand. One sees one's physical body like a hole in a lotus root. As practice becomes more advanced, one sees the body as entirely empty, without any form.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a25_12']	外色亦爾。	外色亦爾。	002	External forms are also like this.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293a28_9']	內外虛空同為一空，是時心緣虛空無量無邊，便離色想安隱快樂，如鳥在瓶瓶破得出，翱翔虛空無所觸礙，是名初無色定。	內外虛空同為一空，是時心緣虛空無量無邊，便離色想安隱快樂，如鳥在瓶瓶破得出，翱翔虛空無所觸礙，是名初無色定。	002	The internal and external emptiness are unified as a single emptiness. At this time, the mind contemplates emptiness as immeasurable and boundless, and one then becomes free from the notion of form, peaceful and blissful. It is like a bird in a bottle. When the bottle is broken, it can soar in the sky without obstruction. This is called the first formless concentration.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b01_6']	行者如虛空中受想行識，如病如癰如瘡如刺，無常苦空無我，更求妙定則離空緣。	行者如虛空中受想行識，如病如癰如瘡如刺，無常苦空無我，更求妙定則離空緣。	002	The practitioner regards the feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness in emptiness as a disease, a boil, a wound, a thorn, impermanent, suffering, empty, and non-self. Seeking a more wonderful concentration, one then becomes free from the condition of emptiness.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b01_11']	所以者何？	所以者何？	002	Why is this so?
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b02_13']	知是心所想虛空欺誑虛妄，先無今有已有還無。	知是心所想虛空欺誑虛妄，先無今有已有還無。	002	Knowing that this is a mental state, that the thought of space is deceptive and false, that it did not exist before but now exists, and that after existing it will again not exist.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b03_11']	既知其患，是虛空從識而有，謂識為真。	既知其患，是虛空從識而有，謂識為真。	002	Having known its faults, this space arises from consciousness, and consciousness is considered true.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b05_19']	但觀於識捨於空緣，習於識觀時，漸見識相相續而生，如流水燈焰，未來現在過去識，識相續無邊無量。	但觀於識捨於空緣，習於識觀時，漸見識相相續而生，如流水燈焰，未來現在過去識，識相續無邊無量。	002	But only observing consciousness and abandoning the condition of space, when practicing the observation of consciousness, one gradually sees the characteristics of consciousness arising in continuity, like a flowing stream or a burning flame. Future, present, and past consciousness, the continuity of consciousness is boundless and immeasurable.

['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b06_14']	何以故佛說識處無邊無量？	何以故佛說識處無邊無量？	002	Why did the Buddha say that the sphere of consciousness is boundless and immeasurable?
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b06_17']	答曰：	答曰：	002	Answer:
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b07_13']	識能遠緣故無邊，無邊法緣故無邊。	識能遠緣故無邊，無邊法緣故無邊。	002	Because consciousness can reach far, it is boundless. Because it conditions boundless dharmas, it is boundless.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b09_17']	復次先緣虛空無邊，若破無邊虛空，識應無邊，行者心柔軟故能令識大乃至無邊，是名無邊識處。	復次先緣虛空無邊，若破無邊虛空，識應無邊，行者心柔軟故能令識大乃至無邊，是名無邊識處。	002	Furthermore, previously conditioning boundless space, if one destroys boundless space, consciousness should be boundless. Because the practitioner's mind is flexible, it can make consciousness great and even boundless. This is called the sphere of boundless consciousness.

['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b11_1']	答曰：	答曰：	002	Answer:
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b12_10']	一切內法識為其主，諸心數法皆隨屬識，若說識者則說餘事。	一切內法識為其主，諸心數法皆隨屬識，若說識者則說餘事。	002	In all internal dharmas, consciousness is the main factor, and all mental factors are subordinate to consciousness. If one speaks of consciousness, then one speaks of the other matters.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b15_1']	復次欲界中色陰為主，色界中受陰為主，虛空處、識處識陰為主，無所有處想陰為主，非想非非想處行陰為主。	復次欲界中色陰為主，色界中受陰為主，虛空處、識處識陰為主，無所有處想陰為主，非想非非想處行陰為主。	002	Furthermore, in the desire realm, the form aggregate is the main factor. In the form realm, the feeling aggregate is the main factor. In the sphere of infinite space and the sphere of infinite consciousness, the consciousness aggregate is the main factor. In the sphere of nothingness, the perception aggregate is the main factor. In the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the formation aggregate is the main factor.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b15_6']	復次三法：	復次三法：	002	Furthermore, there are three dharmas:
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b15_14']	身、心、心數法。	身、心、心數法。	002	body, mind, and mental factors.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b16_15']	欲界、色界以身為主，心隨身故，若無身已心力獨用。	欲界、色界以身為主，心隨身故，若無身已心力獨用。	002	In the desire realm and the form realm, the body is the main factor, because the mind follows the body. If there is no body, the power of the mind alone is used.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b16_20']	心有二分：	心有二分：	002	The mind has two aspects:
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b17_16']	一分緣空、一分自緣，是故應有二處：	一分緣空、一分自緣，是故應有二處：	002	one aspect is directed towards emptiness, and one aspect is directed towards itself. Therefore, there should be two spheres:
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b18_1']	空處、識處。	空處、識處。	002	the sphere of infinite space and the sphere of infinite consciousness.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b19_1']	但初破色故虛空受名，破虛空故獨識為名。	但初破色故虛空受名，破虛空故獨識為名。	002	But because the form is initially destroyed, emptiness receives the name. Because emptiness is destroyed, consciousness alone is named.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b19_9']	心數法亦有二分：	心數法亦有二分：	002	Mental factors also have two aspects:
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b20_5']	一分想、一分行，是故亦應有二處：	一分想、一分行，是故亦應有二處：	002	one aspect is perception, and one aspect is formation. Therefore, there should also be two spheres:
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b20_19']	想無所有處、行非想非非想處。	想無所有處、行非想非非想處。	002	The thought of the sphere of nothingness leads to the practice of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b22_4']	復次緣識故得離虛空處，以是故雖有餘陰，但識受名。	復次緣識故得離虛空處，以是故雖有餘陰，但識受名。	002	Furthermore, by relying on consciousness one can depart from the sphere of space. For this reason, although there are other aggregates, only consciousness is named.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b23_20']	行者得識處已，更求妙定，觀識為患，如上說。	行者得識處已，更求妙定，觀識為患，如上說。	002	The practitioner, having attained the sphere of consciousness, further seeks for a wonderful concentration. He observes consciousness as a calamity, as explained above.
['ZH_T15_0616_002:0293b26_16']	復次觀識如幻虛誑屬諸因緣而不自在，有緣則生、無緣則滅，識不住情亦不住緣亦不住中間，非有住處非無住處，識相如是。	復次觀識如幻虛誑屬諸因緣而不自在，有緣則生、無緣則滅，識不住情亦不住緣亦不住中間，非有住處非無住處，識相如是。	002	Furthermore, he observes consciousness as illusory and deceptive, belonging to various causes and conditions, and not being independent. When there are conditions, it arises; when there are no conditions, it ceases. Consciousness does not abide in the mind, nor does it abide in conditions, nor does it abide in between. It does not have a place to abide, nor does it not have a place to abide. The characteristics of consciousness are like this.
