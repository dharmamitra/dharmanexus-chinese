It is the case where a bhikṣu, apart from the desire of the desire realm, apart from the evil and unwholesome states, dwells having attained the first concentration endowed with vitarka and vicāra, and also endowed with joy and happiness born of seclusion. He further abandons vitarka and vicāra, and dwells having attained the second concentration, which is endowed with inner serenity and unified mind, without vitarka and vicāra, and also endowed with joy and happiness born of concentration. He further abandons joy, and dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness with the body, and he dwells having attained the third concentration of the noble ones as taught by the noble ones, which is endowed with equanimity and mindfulness.
