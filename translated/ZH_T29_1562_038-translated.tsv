In the uninterrupted succession of dharmas of the Buddha, a single Buddha is established by name, without a separate single Buddha able to accomplish the dharmas of a Buddha.

By attaining those dharmas, one is able to awaken to everything. Because of their supremacy, the body attains the name of Buddha, not because of the body of form and so forth, which are the same before and after.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b06_9']	為歸一佛、一切佛耶？	為歸一佛、一切佛耶？	Should one take refuge in a single Buddha or in all Buddhas?
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b07_16']	理實應言歸一切佛，以諸佛道相無異故，經主此中作如是說。	理實應言歸一切佛，以諸佛道相無異故，經主此中作如是說。	In reality, it should be said that one returns to all Buddhas, because the characteristics of the paths of all Buddhas are no different. The author of the treatise states here:
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b10_6']	然尋本論，不見有言唯無學法即名為佛，但言無學法能成於佛，不遮所依身亦是佛體，是故於此不可難言。	然尋本論，不見有言唯無學法即名為佛，但言無學法能成於佛，不遮所依身亦是佛體，是故於此不可難言。	However, when we examine the original treatise, we do not see the words only the dharmas of post-learner are called Buddha. It only says that the dharmas of post-learner can accomplish Buddhahood, and does not deny that the supported body is also the essence of Buddha. Therefore, it cannot be argued here:
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b11_16']	若唯無學法即是佛者，如何於佛所惡心出血，但損生身成無間罪？	若唯無學法即是佛者，如何於佛所惡心出血，但損生身成無間罪？	If only the dharmas of post-learner are Buddha, how is it that when one maliciously draws blood from a Buddha, one only injures the physical body and commits a heinous crime?
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b13_4']	今詳經主於本論義未甚研尋，能成佛言已遮佛體攝依身故。	今詳經主於本論義未甚研尋，能成佛言已遮佛體攝依身故。	We carefully examine the meaning of the original treatise, and the words can accomplish Buddha have already refuted the inclusion of the supported body in the essence of Buddha.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b14_3']	謂佛名言依佛義立，唯此所目是真佛體。	謂佛名言依佛義立，唯此所目是真佛體。	This means that the name Buddha is established based on the meaning of Buddha, and only this is the true essence of Buddha.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b16_1']	若佛名言就依身立，於未證得無學法時，已有依身應亦名佛，故知佛號不目依身。	若佛名言就依身立，於未證得無學法時，已有依身應亦名佛，故知佛號不目依身。	If the name Buddha is established based on the supported body, then when one has not yet attained the dharmas of post-learner, one would already have a supported body and should also be called Buddha. Therefore, we know that the title Buddha does not refer to the supported body.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b17_19']	由此依身非能成佛，故本論說能成佛言，已遮依身亦是佛體，已顯佛體唯無學法。	由此依身非能成佛，故本論說能成佛言，已遮依身亦是佛體，已顯佛體唯無學法。	Therefore the body is not that which becomes a Buddha. The treatise says that it is the Dharma that becomes a Buddha, and this refutes the body being the essence of a Buddha. It also shows that the essence of a Buddha is only the dharmas of post-learners.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b18_9']	或設許然，亦非無難。	或設許然，亦非無難。	Even if we allow this, there is still a difficulty.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b18_18']	謂佛體性略有二種：	謂佛體性略有二種：	The essence of a Buddha is of two kinds:
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b19_8']	一者世俗、二者勝義。	一者世俗、二者勝義。	one is conventional and the other is ultimate.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b21_6']	歸依佛者現對世俗，於勝義佛繫念歸依，以託依身而歸依彼，由得彼故得佛名法。	歸依佛者現對世俗，於勝義佛繫念歸依，以託依身而歸依彼，由得彼故得佛名法。	Those who take refuge in the Buddha now face the conventional, and in the ultimate Buddha they focus their thoughts and take refuge. Because they rely on the body to take refuge in him, by attaining him they attain the name of Dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b22_7']	故唯無學法，是勝義佛體，成無間罪由損勝義。	故唯無學法，是勝義佛體，成無間罪由損勝義。	Therefore only the dharmas of post-learners are the essence of the ultimate Buddha. The attainment of the uninterrupted [evil] is due to harming the ultimate.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b23_6']	然勝義佛必不可損，依如是義理可難言：	然勝義佛必不可損，依如是義理可難言：	However, the ultimate Buddha cannot be harmed. Based on this principle, one can ask:
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b23_16']	如何於佛所惡心出血：	如何於佛所惡心出血：	How is it that drawing blood with an evil mind towards a Buddha
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b24_7']	但損害生身成無間罪。	但損害生身成無間罪。	only harms the born body and constitutes an uninterrupted [evil]?

['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b25_7']	壞彼所依，彼隨壞故。	壞彼所依，彼隨壞故。	Because by destroying his support, he is also destroyed.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b25_17']	如是釋難，深為應理。	如是釋難，深為應理。	This explanation of the difficulty is very reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b26_5']	又彼經主作如是難：	又彼經主作如是難：	Moreover, the author of the treatise raises this difficulty:
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b27_4']	若異此者，應佛與僧住世俗心，非僧非佛。	若異此者，應佛與僧住世俗心，非僧非佛。	If it were otherwise, then when the Buddha and the Saṅgha are abiding in a worldly mind, they would not be the Saṅgha or the Buddha.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b27_9']	云何如是？	云何如是？	How is this so?
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b28_3']	以於爾時學無學法不現前故。	以於爾時學無學法不現前故。	Because at that time the dharmas of learners and post-learners are not manifest.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b28_13']	此難不然，非所許故。	此難不然，非所許故。	This difficulty is not so, because it is not accepted.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556b29_10']	謂我不許學無學法唯現在位方成佛僧。	謂我不許學無學法唯現在位方成佛僧。	That is to say, I do not accept that the dharmas of learners and post-learners only become the Buddha and the Saṅgha when they are in the present state.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556c01_10']	唯言佛僧得彼法故，得於諸位曾無間斷。	唯言佛僧得彼法故，得於諸位曾無間斷。	Because the Buddha and the Saṅgha only obtain those dharmas, and their obtainment is never interrupted in any state.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556c02_2']	寧住世俗心便非僧非佛？	寧住世俗心便非僧非佛？	How can it be that when abiding in a worldly mind, they are not the Saṅgha or the Buddha?
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556c04_1']	設許現在方成佛僧，亦無有過，以許彼得其體亦是學無學故，得一切時常現前故。	設許現在方成佛僧，亦無有過，以許彼得其體亦是學無學故，得一切時常現前故。	Even if it is accepted that only when present do they become the Buddha and the Saṅgha, there is still no error, because it is accepted that their obtainment is also the dharmas of learners and post-learners, and because their obtainment is always manifest at all times.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556c04_6']	經主復言：	經主復言：	The author of the treatise says again:
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556c04_19']	又應唯執成苾芻戒即是苾芻。	又應唯執成苾芻戒即是苾芻。	One should only accept that the precepts of becoming a bhikṣu are precisely the bhikṣu.

['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556c07_6']	是故經主於對法宗，不善了知所說文義。	是故經主於對法宗，不善了知所說文義。	Therefore, the author of the treatise does not understand well the words and meanings spoken in the Abhidharma school.

Also, fire that is associated with chaff is not called chaff. If the person is associated with the Buddha, it should be called the Buddha person, but the person is not called the Buddha.
['ZH_T29_1562_038:0556c16_9']	如是救執，竟何所成？	如是救執，竟何所成？	What is the point of this argument?

Only this dharma has this characteristic, and therefore this dharma is the refuge, but not the others.
