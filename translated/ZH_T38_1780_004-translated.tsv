['ZH_T38_1780_004:0876a14_4']	現自在神通即實慧方便，決定實相即方便實慧，雖實相而神通、雖神通而實相，動寂不二而權實宛然。	現自在神通即實慧方便，決定實相即方便實慧，雖實相而神通、雖神通而實相，動寂不二而權實宛然。	Manifesting freely sovereign spiritual powers is the skillful means of true wisdom, and the definitive true aspect is the true wisdom of skillful means. Although it is the true aspect, it is spiritual powers; although it is spiritual powers, it is the true aspect. Motion and stillness are not two, yet the provisional and true are distinct.

Taking the bodhisattvas as the main teachers, it is precisely the two knowledges that are called bodhisattvas. Skillful means and true wisdom are not the same as ordinary people, and true wisdom and skillful means distinguish them from the lesser vehicle.

The two knowledges are unique to the bodhisattvas' Dharma. Therefore, prajñā does not belong to the two vehicles or the Buddha, but only to the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T38_1780_004:0876a26_2']	般若之巧名為漚和，般若尚不屬二乘，漚和即聲聞絕分，故以智為宗，不取境也。	般若之巧名為漚和，般若尚不屬二乘，漚和即聲聞絕分，故以智為宗，不取境也。	The skillful means of prajñā is called upāya. Prajñā is not even related to the two vehicles, let alone upāya being within the purview of the śrāvakas. Therefore, it takes wisdom as its essence, not objects.

Therefore, it says that buddhas and bodhisattvas have a liberation called the inconceivable. Abiding in this liberation, they can manifest all forms and expound all teachings, while beings cannot fathom it. Therefore, it is generally called the inconceivable liberation. This is the two knowledges, so the two knowledges are taken as the essence.
