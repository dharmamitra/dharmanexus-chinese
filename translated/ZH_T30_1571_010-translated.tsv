Sometimes due to other conditions, they are unable to decisively understand. Using the teachings of correct principles, the previous school is repeatedly revealed, enabling them to dispel doubts and abandon all inverted attachments.

Other schools also accept that all phenomena and names are established by the mind in accordance with worldly conventions.

However, due to the causes and conditions of the karma of slandering the Dharma that they had previously accepted, they unilaterally upheld the Tathāgata's teaching of emptiness that destroys characteristics, denigrating the Dharma door of revealing the true reality that was taught, causing the world to consider what is not Dharma to be Dharma, and what is Dharma to be not Dharma, to consider what is not meaning to be meaning, and what is meaning to be not meaning, harming themselves and others. This is deeply lamentable.

In order to distinguish conventional existence, it is said that true reality is non-existent. The words true reality is non-existent still rely on conventional [truth] to speak. The teaching that true reality is non-existent can accord with and approach true reality. Therefore, the various sūtras often speak of non-existence.
