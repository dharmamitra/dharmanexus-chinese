Now, in this [chapter], the distinguishing characteristics are briefly revealed.🔽Samādhi with initial and sustained thought refers to samādhi associated with initial and sustained thought. This is included in the first dhyāna and the preliminary stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766a18_16']	無尋唯伺三摩地者，謂唯與伺相應等持，此即中間靜慮地攝。	無尋唯伺三摩地者，謂唯與伺相應等持，此即中間靜慮地攝。	079	Samādhi without initial thought but only sustained thought refers to samādhi associated only with sustained thought. This is included in the intermediate dhyāna stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766a20_13']	無尋無伺三摩地者，謂非尋伺相應等持，此從第二靜慮近分乃至非想非非想攝。	無尋無伺三摩地者，謂非尋伺相應等持，此從第二靜慮近分乃至非想非非想攝。	079	Samādhi without applied thought and sustained thought is samādhi not associated with applied thought and sustained thought. It is included in the stage of access to the second dhyāna and above, up to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766a28_2']	空三摩地，謂空、非我二種行相相應等持，故說空等持近治有身見，身見亦有二行相故。	空三摩地，謂空、非我二種行相相應等持，故說空等持近治有身見，身見亦有二行相故。	079	The samādhi of emptiness is samādhi associated with the two aspects of emptiness and non-self. Therefore, it is said that the samādhi of emptiness is the proximate antidote to the view of a real self, because the view of a real self also has two aspects.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b01_3']	謂空行相近治我所見，非我行相近治我見，觀法非我名非我行相，觀此中無我名空行相。	謂空行相近治我所見，非我行相近治我見，觀法非我名非我行相，觀此中無我名空行相。	079	The aspect of emptiness is a proximate antidote to the view of mine, and the aspect of nonself is a proximate antidote to the view of self. The contemplation that dharmas are not a self is called the aspect of nonself. The contemplation that there is no self in them is called the aspect of emptiness.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b02_8']	由此空行相近治我所見，以此中都無我故此法非我所。	由此空行相近治我所見，以此中都無我故此法非我所。	079	Consequently, the aspect of emptiness is a proximate antidote to the view of mine, because there is absolutely no self in this. Therefore, these dharmas are not mine.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b03_20']	豈不空行相即非我行相，知此非我、此中無我，二種行相竟有何別？	豈不空行相即非我行相，知此非我、此中無我，二種行相竟有何別？	079	Isn’t the aspect of emptiness the aspect of nonself? What difference is there between the two aspects of knowing that this is not a self and that there is no self in this?
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b05_1']	非無差別，言此中無我，不能顯我畢竟無體故。	非無差別，言此中無我，不能顯我畢竟無體故。	079	There is a difference, because the words there is no self in this do not reveal that the self is absolutely nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b06_8']	謂此但顯彼此互無，不能顯成畢竟無我，以有體法亦互無故。	謂此但顯彼此互無，不能顯成畢竟無我，以有體法亦互無故。	079	This only reveals that this and that are mutually absent, but it does not reveal that the self is absolutely nonexistent, because dharmas that exist do not exist in each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b07_12']	若言此法非我，便顯我畢竟無，以一切法法相等故。	若言此法非我，便顯我畢竟無，以一切法法相等故。	079	If it is said that this dharma is not a self, then it reveals that the self is absolutely nonexistent, because all dharmas are equal in their characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b09_1']	由此若修非我行相便治我見，修空行相治我所見，如何無別？	由此若修非我行相便治我見，修空行相治我所見，如何無別？	079	Consequently, if one cultivates the aspect of nonself, one then remedies the view of self. If one cultivates the aspect of emptiness, one remedies the view of mine. How can there be no difference?
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b11_2']	無相三摩地，謂緣滅諦四種行相相應等持，涅槃離諸相故名無相，緣彼三摩地得無相名。	無相三摩地，謂緣滅諦四種行相相應等持，涅槃離諸相故名無相，緣彼三摩地得無相名。	079	Concentration associated with the four aspects of the truth of cessation is called concentration of signlessness, because nirvana is devoid of signs.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b12_1']	相略有十，謂色等五、男女二種、三有為相。	相略有十，謂色等五、男女二種、三有為相。	079	There are ten kinds of signs: the five such as form, the two sexes, and the three marks of the conditioned.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b12_19']	或復相者是因異名，涅槃無因故名無相。	或復相者是因異名，涅槃無因故名無相。	079	Or, signs are another name for causes, and nirvana has no causes, so it is called signless.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b13_17']	或相謂世蘊上中下，涅槃異彼故名無相。	或相謂世蘊上中下，涅槃異彼故名無相。	079	Or, signs are the superior, middling, and inferior of the world, and nirvana is different from them, so it is called signless.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b14_17']	無願三摩地，謂緣餘諦十種行相相應等持。	無願三摩地，謂緣餘諦十種行相相應等持。	079	Concentration associated with the ten aspects of the other truths is called concentration of wishlessness.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b15_25']	十行相者，謂苦、非常、因、集、生、緣、道、如、行、出。	十行相者，謂苦、非常、因、集、生、緣、道、如、行、出。	079	The ten aspects are suffering, impermanence, cause, accumulation, birth, condition, path, suchness, practice, and exit.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b17_14']	如是空等三三摩地，三摩地相雖無差別，而依對治意樂所緣，如其次第建立三種。	如是空等三三摩地，三摩地相雖無差別，而依對治意樂所緣，如其次第建立三種。	079	Although the characteristics of these three concentrations such as emptiness are not different, they are established in three kinds according to their antidotes, intentions, and objects, in that order.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b18_14']	由意樂故不願三有，理且可然，有過患故；	由意樂故不願三有，理且可然，有過患故；	079	It is reasonable to say that one does not seek the three realms of existence because they are full of suffering,
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b19_3']	寧由意樂不願聖道？	寧由意樂不願聖道？	079	but how can one not seek the holy path because of ones attitude?
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b19_12']	以諸聖道依屬有故。	以諸聖道依屬有故。	079	Because the holy path is related to existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b20_2']	若爾，何用修習聖道？	若爾，何用修習聖道？	079	If this is so, then why cultivate the holy path?
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b20_11']	以是涅槃能趣因故。	以是涅槃能趣因故。	079	Because it is the cause that leads to nirvana.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b21_10']	非離聖道有得涅槃，為求涅槃故修聖道。	非離聖道有得涅槃，為求涅槃故修聖道。	079	There is no attainment of nirvana apart from the holy path, and one cultivates the holy path in order to seek nirvana.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b23_10']	道如船筏必應捨故，亦由意樂不願聖道，故緣道行相亦得無願名，以本期心厭有為故。	道如船筏必應捨故，亦由意樂不願聖道，故緣道行相亦得無願名，以本期心厭有為故。	079	The path is like a boat or a raft and one must abandon it. Also, because of ones attitude, one does not seek the holy path. Therefore the aspects of the path are also called wishless, because one originally made a vow to detest conditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b25_13']	空非我相非所厭捨，以與涅槃相相似故，由此二行相雖緣可厭法，不取可厭相，不得無願名。	空非我相非所厭捨，以與涅槃相相似故，由此二行相雖緣可厭法，不取可厭相，不得無願名。	079	The aspects of emptiness and nonself are not to be abandoned, because they are similar to nirvana. Consequently, even though these two aspects of the truths of suffering and the origin have aspects that are to be detested, they do not take on the aspect of being detestable and are not called wishless.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b26_11']	此三等持通淨無漏，世出世間等持攝故。	此三等持通淨無漏，世出世間等持攝故。	079	These three samadhis are categorized as pure and uncontaminated, because they are included in the supramundane and mundane samadhis.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b27_19']	世間攝故通十一地，出世攝者唯通九地，上七定邊無勝德故。	世間攝故通十一地，出世攝者唯通九地，上七定邊無勝德故。	079	Because it is included in the mundane realm, it is found in eleven stages. If it is included in the supramundane realm, it is found only in nine stages, because the upper seven trance states lack superior qualities.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766b29_1']	於中無漏者名三解脫門，能與涅槃為入門故。	於中無漏者名三解脫門，能與涅槃為入門故。	079	Among these, the pure ones are called the three gates of liberation, because they can serve as gates of entry into nirvana.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c01_2']	非諸有漏法是真解脫門，性住世間違解脫故。	非諸有漏法是真解脫門，性住世間違解脫故。	079	Not all impure dharmas are true gates of liberation, because their natures abide in the mundane realm and oppose liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c02_10']	三三摩地緣境別者，若有漏空緣一切法，若無漏空唯緣苦諦。	三三摩地緣境別者，若有漏空緣一切法，若無漏空唯緣苦諦。	079	As for the specific objects of the three samadhis, if they are impure, emptiness takes all dharmas as objects. If they are pure, emptiness takes only the truth of suffering as its object.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c03_8']	無願能緣苦集道諦，無相唯緣滅諦為境。	無願能緣苦集道諦，無相唯緣滅諦為境。	079	Non-desire is able to take the truths of suffering, accumulation, and the path as objects. The signless only takes the truth of cessation as its object.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c04_8']	三三摩地念住別者，無相唯法，餘皆通四。	三三摩地念住別者，無相唯法，餘皆通四。	079	As for the specific foundations of mindfulness of the three samadhis, the signless is only the dharma foundation, while the others are all four.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c06_3']	契經復說三重等持，一空空三摩地、二無願無願三摩地、三無相無相三摩地。	契經復說三重等持，一空空三摩地、二無願無願三摩地、三無相無相三摩地。	079	The sutras also speak of three kinds of samadhis: the samadhi of emptiness of emptiness, the samadhi of non-desire of non-desire, and the samadhi of signlessness of signlessness.

['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c11_3']	此三等持，緣前空等取空等相，故立空空等名。	此三等持，緣前空等取空等相，故立空空等名。	079	These three samādhis take the emptiness, etc., of previous emptiness, etc., as their objects and take emptiness, etc., as their aspects. Therefore they are called emptiness of emptiness, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c12_11']	空空等持緣前無學空三摩地，取彼空相，空相順厭勝非我故。	空空等持緣前無學空三摩地，取彼空相，空相順厭勝非我故。	079	The samādhi of emptiness of emptiness takes the previous śaikṣa emptiness samādhi as its object and takes its aspect of emptiness. The aspect of emptiness is in accord with disgust and is superior to the aspect of non-self.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c15_7']	謂彼先起無學等持，於五取蘊思惟空相，從此後起殊勝善根相應等持，緣前無學空三摩地思惟空相，於空取空故名空空。	謂彼先起無學等持，於五取蘊思惟空相，從此後起殊勝善根相應等持，緣前無學空三摩地思惟空相，於空取空故名空空。	079	This means that one first gives rise to a śaikṣa samādhi and contemplates the aspect of emptiness regarding the five appropriated aggregates. After this, one gives rise to a samādhi associated with a superior wholesome root and takes the previous śaikṣa emptiness samādhi as its object, contemplating its aspect of emptiness. Because one takes emptiness as emptiness, it is called emptiness of emptiness.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c16_6']	如燒死屍以杖迴轉，屍既盡已杖亦應燒。	如燒死屍以杖迴轉，屍既盡已杖亦應燒。	079	It is like burning a corpse with a stick, and when the corpse is exhausted, the stick should also be burned.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c17_9']	如是由空燒煩惱已，復起空定厭捨前空重空等持。	如是由空燒煩惱已，復起空定厭捨前空重空等持。	079	In the same way, after emptiness burns afflictions, one again gives rise to emptiness concentration to disgust and abandon the previous emptiness. The samādhi of emptiness of emptiness is like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c18_15']	空行相後起，即復還與空行相相應，唯此最能順厭捨故。	空行相後起，即復還與空行相相應，唯此最能順厭捨故。	079	When the aspect of emptiness arises, it is immediately followed by the aspect of emptiness, because this is the most skillful in causing one to turn away from and abandon the aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c20_7']	非我行相則不如是，見無我者於諸有為法起厭背心，不如見空故。	非我行相則不如是，見無我者於諸有為法起厭背心，不如見空故。	079	The aspect of nonself is not like this, because one who sees nonself in conditioned dharmas generates a mind that turns away from them, but not as much as when one sees emptiness.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c21_16']	諸有已見諸法無我，而於諸有猶生樂者，以於諸行中不審見空故。	諸有已見諸法無我，而於諸有猶生樂者，以於諸行中不審見空故。	079	Those who have already seen that dharmas are without self still generate pleasure in regard to the three realms of existence because they have not thoroughly seen emptiness in the aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c23_7']	由此空定雖二行相俱，而但名空，不說為非我，空於厭捨極隨順故。	由此空定雖二行相俱，而但名空，不說為非我，空於厭捨極隨順故。	079	Consequently, although the two aspects of emptiness and nonself both occur in the samādhi of emptiness, it is only called emptiness and not nonself, because emptiness is most conducive to turning away from and abandoning the aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c24_7']	無願無願緣前無學無願等持，取非常相。	無願無願緣前無學無願等持，取非常相。	079	The samādhi of wishlessness in regard to wishlessness takes the aspect of impermanence as its object, that is, the prior wishlessness of the post-learner.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c27_10']	謂彼先起無學等持，於五取蘊中思惟非常相，從此後起殊勝善根相應等持，緣前無學無願三摩地思惟非常相，於無願不願，名無願無願。	謂彼先起無學等持，於五取蘊中思惟非常相，從此後起殊勝善根相應等持，緣前無學無願三摩地思惟非常相，於無願不願，名無願無願。	079	That is, one first generates the samādhi of a post-learner and reflects on the aspect of impermanence in regard to the five aggregates that are grasped. Subsequently, one generates a samādhi associated with a superior wholesome root and takes as its object the prior wishless samādhi of the post-learner, reflecting on the aspect of impermanence. One does not wish for wishlessness, and this is called the samādhi of wishlessness in regard to wishlessness.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c27_20']	舉喻顯示，如前應知。	舉喻顯示，如前應知。	079	The analogy is to be understood as above.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0766c29_12']	重無願等持非常行相後起，即復還與非常行相相應，唯此可能緣厭道故。	重無願等持非常行相後起，即復還與非常行相相應，唯此可能緣厭道故。	079	The heavy samādhi of non-desire, etc., after arising with the aspect of impermanence, immediately returns to being associated with the aspect of impermanence. Only this can take the path of disgust as its object.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0767a01_12']	非苦行相能緣聖道，聖道非苦，趣苦滅故。	非苦行相能緣聖道，聖道非苦，趣苦滅故。	079	The aspect of suffering cannot take the noble path as its object, because the noble path is not suffering, because it leads to the cessation of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0767a03_2']	苦法不能趣苦寂滅，亦非因等四能緣聖道，以聖道不能令苦續故。	苦法不能趣苦寂滅，亦非因等四能緣聖道，以聖道不能令苦續故。	079	Suffering dharmas cannot lead to the cessation and extinction of suffering, nor can the four such as cause, etc., take the noble path as their object, because the noble path cannot cause suffering to continue.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0767a04_3']	非道等四者，此厭捨道故，非欣行相能為厭捨。	非道等四者，此厭捨道故，非欣行相能為厭捨。	079	The four such as path, etc., are not the four such as cause, etc., because this disgust and abandonment of the path is not the aspect of joy that can cause disgust and abandonment.
['ZH_T29_1562_079:0767a05_4', 'ZH_T29_1562_079:0767a06_5']	豈不如無願不願聖道，而作道等四此亦應然？🔽此例不然，無願正厭有，兼於聖道起不願心故。	豈不如無願不願聖道，而作道等四此亦應然？ 此例不然，無願正厭有，兼於聖道起不願心故。	079	Isn't it like the non-desire that does not desire the noble path, but makes the four such as path, etc.? This should also be so.🔽This example is not correct.
