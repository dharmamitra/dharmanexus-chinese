['ZH_T35_1735_003:0519c12_15']	大悲大智為增上緣，令彼所化根熟眾生心中現佛色聲說法，是故聖教唯是眾生心中影像。	大悲大智為增上緣，令彼所化根熟眾生心中現佛色聲說法，是故聖教唯是眾生心中影像。	003	Great compassion and great wisdom serve as the dominant conditions, enabling the Buddhas to manifest their form and sound in the minds of sentient beings who are ready to be transformed and to expound the Dharma. Therefore, the holy teachings are only the reflections in the minds of sentient beings.

This means that outside of the true mind of the Buddha there are no separate sentient beings, because the true mind of sentient beings is precisely the true mind of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0519c25_1']	則唯說無聽，故所說教唯佛所現。	則唯說無聽，故所說教唯佛所現。	003	Then there is only speaking and no listening, so the taught teachings are only manifested by the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0519c26_3']	二眾生心外更無別佛，以佛真心即眾生真心故。	二眾生心外更無別佛，以佛真心即眾生真心故。	003	Second, outside of the minds of sentient beings there is no separate Buddha, because the true mind of the Buddha is precisely the true mind of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0519c27_1']	則唯聽無說，故所說教即眾生自現。	則唯聽無說，故所說教即眾生自現。	003	Then there is only listening and no speaking, so the taught teachings are precisely manifested by sentient beings themselves.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0519c27_19']	〈梵行品〉云「知一切法即心自性」等。	〈梵行品〉云「知一切法即心自性」等。	003	The Brahma's Net Sutra says, Know that all dharmas are the self-nature of the mind and so forth.

['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a01_14']	四佛即眾生故非佛、眾生即佛故非眾生，互奪雙亡，則說聽斯寂。	四佛即眾生故非佛、眾生即佛故非眾生，互奪雙亡，則說聽斯寂。	003	Fourth, because the Buddha is precisely sentient beings, he is not the Buddha; because sentient beings are precisely the Buddha, they are not sentient beings. Mutually negating and both disappearing, then the speaker and listener are quiescent.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a02_16']	故《淨名》云「其說法者無說無示，其聽法者無聞無得。	故《淨名》云「其說法者無說無示，其聽法者無聞無得。	003	Therefore the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra says, For the one who expounds the Dharma, there is no speaking and no demonstration; for the one who listens to the Dharma, there is no hearing and no attainment.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a04_18']	」二約別教以明四句，謂由不壞相，生佛互在故、一眾生全在佛中故、則果門攝法無遺。	」二約別教以明四句，謂由不壞相，生佛互在故、一眾生全在佛中故、則果門攝法無遺。	003	Second, using the separate teaching to clarify the four statements, it means that because the characteristics are not destroyed, the Buddha and sentient beings mutually exist, and because one sentient being completely exists within the Buddha, then the fruition aspect encompasses all phenomena without exception.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a05_15']	生尚在佛心中、況所說教不唯佛現？	生尚在佛心中、況所說教不唯佛現？	003	Sentient beings still exist within the Buddha's mind, let alone the teachings spoken not only being manifested by the Buddha?

['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a11_18']	一切眾生決定無有出如如境者，並為如來之所攝持，故名為藏，眾生為如來藏。	一切眾生決定無有出如如境者，並為如來之所攝持，故名為藏，眾生為如來藏。	003	All sentient beings definitely have never left the realm of suchness, and are all embraced by the Tathāgata, and are therefore called the womb, and sentient beings are the womb of the Tathāgata.

['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a14_18']	二佛在眾生心中故，則因門攝法無遺。	二佛在眾生心中故，則因門攝法無遺。	003	Second, because the Buddha is in the minds of sentient beings, the approach of causes includes all dharmas without exception.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a15_16']	佛尚在於心中，況所說教非眾生心現？	佛尚在於心中，況所說教非眾生心現？	003	Since the Buddha is already in the mind, let alone the teachings spoken not being manifested in the minds of sentient beings?
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a17_3']	故〈出現品〉云「菩薩摩訶薩應知，自心念念常有佛成正覺。	故〈出現品〉云「菩薩摩訶薩應知，自心念念常有佛成正覺。	003	Therefore, the chapter on manifestation says: Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should know that in their own minds, moment after moment, there are Buddhas attaining perfect enlightenment.

['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a18_2']	諸佛如來不離此心成正覺故。	諸佛如來不離此心成正覺故。	003	Because all buddhas and tathāgatas do not depart from this mind to achieve perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a19_4']	如自心，一切眾生心亦復如是，悉有佛成正覺。	如自心，一切眾生心亦復如是，悉有佛成正覺。	003	Just as in one's own mind, the minds of all sentient beings are also like this, all having buddhas achieving perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a21_4']	」此明佛證眾生心中真如成佛，故本覺無異，以始同本，總在眾生心中從體起用。	」此明佛證眾生心中真如成佛，故本覺無異，以始同本，總在眾生心中從體起用。	003	This clarifies that the buddhas' realization of enlightenment in the true suchness of sentient beings' minds is the same as original enlightenment, and that the fundamental and the beginning are the same. In total, it is in the minds of sentient beings, arising from the essence and giving rise to function.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a22_6']	應化身時，即是眾生心中真如用大，更無別佛。	應化身時，即是眾生心中真如用大，更無別佛。	003	When manifesting the responsive and transformation bodies, it is precisely the great function of true suchness in the minds of sentient beings. There is no other buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a23_3']	如《起信》中多明此義，而是自心體用。	如《起信》中多明此義，而是自心體用。	003	As explained in the Awakening of Faith, this meaning is often clarified, but it is the essence and function of one's own mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a24_11']	今以此經心佛眾生無差別故，佛證眾生之體，用眾生之用。	今以此經心佛眾生無差別故，佛證眾生之體，用眾生之用。	003	Now, using this sūtra, because the mind, buddha, and sentient beings are without distinction, the buddhas realize the essence of sentient beings and use the function of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a27_1']	三由前生佛互相在時各實非虛，則因果交徹，隨一聖教全在二心，故眾生心中佛，為佛心中眾生說法；	三由前生佛互相在時各實非虛，則因果交徹，隨一聖教全在二心，故眾生心中佛，為佛心中眾生說法；	003	Third, due to the mutual presence of buddhas and sentient beings in the past, each is real and not false. Then cause and effect penetrate each other, and each sacred teaching is entirely in the two minds. Therefore, the buddhas in the minds of sentient beings expound the Dharma for the sentient beings in the minds of the buddhas;
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520a27_16']	佛心中眾生，聽眾生心中佛說法。	佛心中眾生，聽眾生心中佛說法。	003	In the mind of the Buddha, sentient beings listen to the Buddha speaking the Dharma in the mind of sentient beings.

In accordance with a single holy teaching, both minds are not. Then, in the mind of the Buddha, sentient beings have no listening, and in the mind of sentient beings, the Buddha has no speaking.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520b03_6']	是以〈賢首品〉云「因緣所生無有生，諸佛法身非是身。	是以〈賢首品〉云「因緣所生無有生，諸佛法身非是身。	003	Therefore, the Chapter on the Foremost of Worthies says, What is produced by causes and conditions has no arising. The Dharma body of the buddhas is not a body.

Subsuming the branches by returning to the root is also called using suchness as the essence of the teachings.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0520b16_6']	二會相顯性者，謂彼一切差別教法，從緣無性，即是真如。	二會相顯性者，謂彼一切差別教法，從緣無性，即是真如。	003	Second, revealing the nature by unifying phenomena means that all the differentiated teachings have no nature of their own from conditions, and are therefore suchness.

Suchness accords with conditions and possesses innumerable qualities.

The seventh is the doctrinal school of characteristics, the eighth is the school of no characteristics, and the last two are the school of the nature of phenomena.

Because the cause and effect of the conventional truth are not lost, it exists. This is like the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra and the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra, etc.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0521c11_5']	第八亦名二諦雙絕宗，謂勝義離相故非有，世俗緣生如幻故是無。	第八亦名二諦雙絕宗，謂勝義離相故非有，世俗緣生如幻故是無。	003	The eighth is also called the tenet of the mutual negation of the two truths, which means that because the ultimate truth is free from characteristics, it is not existent. Because the conventional truth arises from conditions like an illusion, it is nonexistent.

['ZH_T35_1735_003:0521c25_1']	前中，略舉十說：	前中，略舉十說：	003	Among the former, I will briefly present ten explanations:
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0521c25_14']	一衍法師，以無礙法界為宗。	一衍法師，以無礙法界為宗。	003	First, Dharma Master Yan takes the unobstructed dharma realm as the tenet.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0521c26_9']	二裕法師，以甚深法界心境為宗。	二裕法師，以甚深法界心境為宗。	003	Second, Dharma Master Yu takes the very profound dharma realm mind and object as the tenet.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0521c27_11']	謂法界門中義分為境，諸佛證之以成淨土。	謂法界門中義分為境，諸佛證之以成淨土。	003	It is said that within the dharma realm gate, the meaning is divided into objects, which the buddhas realize to form the pure land.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0521c29_13']	法界即是一心，諸佛證之以成法身，是故初品中云「無盡平等妙法界，皆悉充滿如來身。	法界即是一心，諸佛證之以成法身，是故初品中云「無盡平等妙法界，皆悉充滿如來身。	003	The dharma realm is precisely the one mind, which the buddhas realize to form the dharma body. Therefore, the first chapter says, The inexhaustible, equal, wondrous dharma realm all completely fills the Tathāgata's body.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a01_13']	」末後明〈入法界品〉，故知唯以法界為宗。	」末後明〈入法界品〉，故知唯以法界為宗。	003	The last chapter clarifies the chapter on entering the dharma realm, therefore it is known that it only takes the dharma realm as the tenet.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a02_12']	三有說以緣起為宗，法界緣起相即入故。	三有說以緣起為宗，法界緣起相即入故。	003	Third, some explain that dependent arising is the tenet, because the characteristics of the dependent arising of the dharma realm mutually include each other.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a04_1']	四有云以唯識為宗，經說「三界唯一心現，心如工畫師」故。	四有云以唯識為宗，經說「三界唯一心現，心如工畫師」故。	003	Fourth, there is an opinion that takes vijñapti-mātra as the fundamental tenet, because the sūtra says, The three realms are only the manifestation of a single mind, the mind is like a skilled painter.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a06_3']	五敏印二師，同以因果為宗，謂此經廣明菩薩行位之因，及顯所成果德，下文不離此故。	五敏印二師，同以因果為宗，謂此經廣明菩薩行位之因，及顯所成果德，下文不離此故。	003	Fifth, the two masters Mīn and Yin both take cause and effect as the fundamental tenet, saying that this sūtra extensively clarifies the causes of the bodhisattva's stages of practice, and reveals the fruition virtues, because the text below does not depart from this.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a07_8']	六遠法師，以華嚴三昧為宗，謂因行之華能嚴佛果故。	六遠法師，以華嚴三昧為宗，謂因行之華能嚴佛果故。	003	Sixth, the master Yuan takes the samādhi of the Flower Ornament as the fundamental tenet, saying that the flowers of causal practices can adorn the fruition of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a08_16']	七笈多三藏，以四十二賢聖觀行為宗，說其行位令成觀故。	七笈多三藏，以四十二賢聖觀行為宗，說其行位令成觀故。	003	Seventh, the Tripiṭaka master Jñānagupta takes the practices of the forty-two sages and worthies as the fundamental tenet, saying that it explains their stages of practice in order to accomplish contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a10_11']	八有說言以海印三昧為宗，逆順理事乃至帝網，如海波澄一時現故。	八有說言以海印三昧為宗，逆順理事乃至帝網，如海波澄一時現故。	003	Eighth, some say that it takes the samādhi of the ocean seal as the fundamental tenet, because it goes against and follows principle and phenomena, up to the imperial net, like the ocean waves becoming still and appearing simultaneously.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a12_6']	九光統律師，以因果理實為宗，以因果是所成行位、理實是所依法界故。	九光統律師，以因果理實為宗，以因果是所成行位、理實是所依法界故。	003	Ninth, the Vinaya master Guangtong takes cause and effect, principle and reality as the fundamental tenet, because cause and effect are the practices and stages to be accomplished, and principle and reality are the basis of the dharmadhātu.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a13_13']	十賢首，以前各互闕故，總以因果緣起理實法界以為宗趣。	十賢首，以前各互闕故，總以因果緣起理實法界以為宗趣。	003	The first ten masters, because each lacks something, generally take cause and effect, dependent origination, principle, reality, and the dharma realm as their purport.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a16_15']	謂前之二師但得所依法界，三四二師但明緣起，五六唯明因果，七唯因修八唯果用，並皆互闕，故賢首意取光統而加緣起法界之言。	謂前之二師但得所依法界，三四二師但明緣起，五六唯明因果，七唯因修八唯果用，並皆互闕，故賢首意取光統而加緣起法界之言。	003	This means that the first two masters only attain the dharma realm that is the basis, the third and fourth masters only clarify dependent origination, the fifth and sixth only clarify cause and effect, the seventh only cultivates causes, the eighth only has the function of results, and they all lack something. Therefore, the intention of the Wise and Sagacious is to take the light and governance, and add the words dependent origination and dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a18_2']	由光統師以因果即緣起、理實即法界，故不開之。	由光統師以因果即緣起、理實即法界，故不開之。	003	This is because the master Guangtong takes cause and effect as dependent origination and principle and reality as the dharma realm, so he does not open them.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a20_16']	賢首以因果是緣起中別義、理實是法界中別義，故加總名，以法界有事理及無礙故、緣起體上之用故，所以加之。	賢首以因果是緣起中別義、理實是法界中別義，故加總名，以法界有事理及無礙故、緣起體上之用故，所以加之。	003	The Wise and Sagacious take cause and effect as a separate meaning within dependent origination and principle and reality as a separate meaning within the dharma realm, so they add the general name. This is because the dharma realm has both principle and phenomena and is unobstructed, and because the function is above the essence of dependent origination, so they add it.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a21_13']	二申今解者，依後二師而頗為改易。	二申今解者，依後二師而頗為改易。	003	Second, as for expressing my own understanding, I rely on the last two masters but make some changes.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a22_14']	若取言略攝盡，應言法界緣起不思議為宗；	若取言略攝盡，應言法界緣起不思議為宗；	003	If one takes the concise words to encompass everything, it should be said that the inconceivable dependent origination of the dharma realm is the purport;
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a23_10']	若取言具，於第十師加不思議。	若取言具，於第十師加不思議。	003	If the word complete is taken, the inconceivable is added to the tenth teacher.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a25_13']	此則攝一總題，理實即大方，緣起即方廣，法界總該前二，因果即佛華嚴，觀其總題已知別義。	此則攝一總題，理實即大方，緣起即方廣，法界總該前二，因果即佛華嚴，觀其總題已知別義。	003	This then includes the general title. In principle, it is truly the great, the dependent origination is the vast, the dharma realm comprehensively includes the previous two, and the cause and effect is the buddha-adorned. Observing the general title, one already knows the specific meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a26_12']	而法界等言，諸經容有，未顯特異故。	而法界等言，諸經容有，未顯特異故。	003	However, the words dharma realm and so forth may be found in various sūtras, and have yet to show what is unique.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a27_15']	以不思議貫之，則法界等皆不思議，故為經宗。	以不思議貫之，則法界等皆不思議，故為經宗。	003	By penetrating it with the inconceivable, then the dharma realm and so forth are all inconceivable, and thus become the essence of the sūtra.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522a28_13']	所以龍樹指此為大不思議經，斯良證也。	所以龍樹指此為大不思議經，斯良證也。	003	Therefore Nāgârjuna refers to it as the Sūtra of the Great Inconceivable. This is good evidence.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b01_11']	《淨名》但明作用不思議解脫，蓋是一分之義，未顯法界融通等不思議，故不同也。	《淨名》但明作用不思議解脫，蓋是一分之義，未顯法界融通等不思議，故不同也。	003	The Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa only clarifies the inconceivable liberation of function, which is a partial meaning, and has yet to show the inconceivable such as the interpenetration of the dharma realm, and thus is not the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b03_17']	若就題中分體宗用，則以理實為體、緣起為用、因果為宗，尋宗令趣理實體，故法界總攝上三。	若就題中分體宗用，則以理實為體、緣起為用、因果為宗，尋宗令趣理實體，故法界總攝上三。	003	If the essence, purport, and function are divided within the title, then the principle reality is taken as the essence, the dependent origination as the function, and the cause and effect as the purport. Seeking the purport causes one to head towards the essence of the principle reality, and thus the dharma realm comprehensively includes the above three.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b04_9']	今釋前義，略分為二：	今釋前義，略分為二：	003	Now, explaining the previous meaning, it is roughly divided into two parts:

['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b07_17']	二顯義中，曲有四門：	二顯義中，曲有四門：	003	In revealing the meaning, there are four approaches:
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b09_16']	第一別開法界以成因果，謂普賢法界為因、遮那法界為果，是故因果不離理實法界。	第一別開法界以成因果，謂普賢法界為因、遮那法界為果，是故因果不離理實法界。	003	First, specifically opening the Dharma realm to form cause and effect. The Dharma realm of Samantabhadra is the cause, and the Dharma realm of Vairocana is the effect. Therefore, cause and effect are not apart from the fundamentally real Dharma realm.

The following will point to the text.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b13_6']	而此因果互為宗趣，一經始終不離因果故。	而此因果互為宗趣，一經始終不離因果故。	003	And this cause and effect mutually become the main purport. Throughout the entire sutra, it is not apart from cause and effect.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b14_1']	但因果為宗，不違所依法界。	但因果為宗，不違所依法界。	003	However, cause and effect are the main theme, not contradicting the dependent Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_003:0522b14_12']	第二會融因果以同法界。	第二會融因果以同法界。	003	The second is to harmonize cause and effect as the same Dharma realm.

Taking the observed object as the main theme and intending to accomplish the observing cognition as the purpose, taking the cultivated accomplished cognition as the main theme and intending to realize the same true object as the purpose.

Each assembly, each chapter, each phrase, each text, all includes everything without any limit. Therefore, the chapter on manifesting the characteristics says, The Buddha Vairocana's vow power pervades the Dharma realm. In all lands, he always turns the unsurpassed wheel. Therefore, among the seventy-three, it is called the perfect cause wheel. This is what it means.
