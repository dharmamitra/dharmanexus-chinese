['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c21_20']	謂得此無念之時。	謂得此無念之時。	009	It is said that when one attains this non-thought,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c22_8']	已覺初相本無所起。	已覺初相本無所起。	009	one has already realized that the initial characteristic is originally without arising.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c22_17']	常自一心本來無念。	常自一心本來無念。	009	It is always the one mind, originally without thought.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c23_7']	由是則知四相皆然。	由是則知四相皆然。	009	Because of this, one then knows that the four characteristics are all the same.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c23_12']	即是一心。	即是一心。	009	It is precisely the one mind.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c24_2']	是心之相元未曾起。	是心之相元未曾起。	009	The characteristics of this mind have never arisen.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c24_16']	非謂別有生住異滅從心而起也。	非謂別有生住異滅從心而起也。	009	It does not mean that there are separate arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing that arise from the mind.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c25_1']	何以故。	何以故。	009	Why is this?
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0347c25_8']	以一一相皆同。	以一一相皆同。	009	Because each characteristic is the same as
