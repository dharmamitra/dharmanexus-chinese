['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b13_1']	以始覺從修新生。	以始覺從修新生。	Because the enlightened mind arises from cultivation and is newly arisen,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b13_8']	本覺性自元有。	本覺性自元有。	Original enlightenment is inherently originally existent.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b13_17']	由是對始以立於本。	由是對始以立於本。	Therefore, in contrast to the beginning, it is established as original.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b14_5']	又以下約別義釋。	又以下約別義釋。	The following explains it with a different meaning.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b14_12']	前約對始名本。	前約對始名本。	The previous one is about the name original in contrast to the beginning.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b14_19']	今約生始名本。	今約生始名本。	Now it is about the meaning of original in the arising of the beginning.

['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b16_8']	故名為始。	故名為始。	Therefore it is called the beginning.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b16_17']	生於始故名為本也。	生於始故名為本也。	Because it arises from the beginning, it is called the original.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b17_6']	苟無所生亦不名本。	苟無所生亦不名本。	If there is nothing produced, it is not called the root.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b17_15']	如女生子方得母稱。	如女生子方得母稱。	Only after a woman gives birth to a child can she be called a mother.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b18_11']	以至下此辨但名覺之所以。	以至下此辨但名覺之所以。	The following discussion distinguishes why it is only called enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b18_17']	以始本既合。	以始本既合。	Since the beginning and the root are already united,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b19_3']	則無二相。	則無二相。	there are no two appearances.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b19_12']	無二相故但是一覺。	無二相故但是一覺。	Because there are no two appearances, it is just one enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b19_17']	故下文云。	故下文云。	Therefore, the text below says:
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b20_4']	亦無始覺之異。	亦無始覺之異。	There is no difference between initial enlightenment and ultimate enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b20_16']	以四相本來平等同一覺故。	以四相本來平等同一覺故。	Because the four characteristics are originally equal and the same as one enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b21_5']	又此下約別義釋。	又此下約別義釋。	This section below explains it from a different perspective.

['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b22_15']	文是明始覺。	文是明始覺。	the text is about clarifying initial enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b23_1']	以依本起始。	以依本起始。	It is based on the root that the beginning arises.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b23_10']	始還同本故名始覺。	始還同本故名始覺。	The beginning returns to the same as the root, so it is called initial enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b23_18']	以始得無念之覺。	以始得無念之覺。	By attaining the enlightenment of no-thought,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b24_4']	名真始覺也。	名真始覺也。	it is called true initial enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b24_12']	已前雖亦名始覺。	已前雖亦名始覺。	Although what came before was also called initial enlightenment,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b25_2']	以未離念猶名不覺。	以未離念猶名不覺。	since it was not yet free from thought, it was still called non-enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b25_11']	或立相似隨分等名。	或立相似隨分等名。	Or it was given names such as similarity or partial completion.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b26_1']	至此念盡已覺初相。	至此念盡已覺初相。	When thought is exhausted, it is the initial appearance of enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b26_6']	故名始覺。	故名始覺。	Therefore it is called initial enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b26_17']	是知直待合同本覺心源。	是知直待合同本覺心源。	This means that only when it is the same as the source of the mind of original enlightenment,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b27_3']	故名究竟覺。	故名究竟覺。	is it called perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b27_14']	智淨相等並同是始覺也。	智淨相等並同是始覺也。	The characteristics of the purity of wisdom and so forth are all the same as initial enlightenment.

['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342b29_5']	以前文云是本所成故。	以前文云是本所成故。	Because the previous text says it is accomplished by the original,

['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c01_2']	同不成始者。	同不成始者。	If the same, it is not initial.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c01_10']	以前云至心源時。	以前云至心源時。	Because the previous says when it reaches the source of the mind,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c02_4']	始本無二平等一相無所待故。	始本無二平等一相無所待故。	the initial and original are non-dual, of a single equal characteristic, and have nothing to rely on.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c02_13']	既而同異二俱不立。	既而同異二俱不立。	Since both the same and different are not established,
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c03_4']	如何說言對始立本耶。	如何說言對始立本耶。	how can it be said that the original is established in contrast to the initial?

['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c04_6']	答意昔日不覺而今始覺。	答意昔日不覺而今始覺。	The meaning of the answer is that what was not enlightened in the past is now initially enlightened.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c04_15']	若窮其體與本不殊。	若窮其體與本不殊。	If one traces its substance, it is no different from the original.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c05_5']	就生滅門相待義邊。	就生滅門相待義邊。	In terms of the aspect of relative meaning in the door of arising and ceasing,

['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c06_14']	形不覺故立為覺也。	形不覺故立為覺也。	Because form is not aware, it is established as awareness.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c07_6']	若至心源已屬真如門攝。	若至心源已屬真如門攝。	If it reaches the source of mind, it is already included in the gate of true suchness.
['ZH_T44_1848_009:0342c07_11']	不同前難。	不同前難。	It is not the same as the previous objection.
