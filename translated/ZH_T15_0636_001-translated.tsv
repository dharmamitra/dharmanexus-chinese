I only heard that bodhisattvas who give rise to the intention will attain that state, but only conceptualized emptiness and could not find a good teacher, and lacked skillful means. I stayed far away from good spiritual friends, was deceived by the king of desire, and my mind became attached without interruption. I lost the perfections and fell into sixty-two kalpas.

All my faculties were immediately severed, and I saw the gate of wisdom. I attained an immovable form and from then on practiced in succession.
