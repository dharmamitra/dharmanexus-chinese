['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c07_11']	聖，但以眾生宿殖善微、過去因弱，致使五濁障於大機，六蔽掩其慧眼；	聖，但以眾生宿殖善微、過去因弱，致使五濁障於大機，六蔽掩其慧眼；	, wishing to awaken the long-lost and make them equally distant from the ultimate sage, but because sentient beings' past cultivation of goodness is slight and their past causes are weak, it causes the five turbidities to obstruct the great capacity, and the six hindrances to cover their wisdom-eye;
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c08_15']	又嶮難長遠生死無際，是故不可頓明一乘因果大理。	又嶮難長遠生死無際，是故不可頓明一乘因果大理。	Moreover, the long and difficult path of birth and death has no end, therefore the great principle of the one vehicle's cause and effect cannot be suddenly revealed.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c09_19']	事不得已，故初詣鹿苑，開三乘異因，指別為趣果。	事不得已，故初詣鹿苑，開三乘異因，指別為趣果。	Since this cannot be helped, he first visited the Deer Park and opened the different causes of the three vehicles, pointing to the separate goals and fruits.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c11_15']	如是荏苒，至於《大品》明教度人，《菴羅》說法弘道，經年歷歲，猶明異因別果長養物機。	如是荏苒，至於《大品》明教度人，《菴羅》說法弘道，經年歷歲，猶明異因別果長養物機。	In this way, he gradually reached the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, which teaches the crossing of people, and the Aparamitāyur-jñāna Sūtra, which expounds the Dharma and promotes the Way. Even after years and years, it still clarifies the different causes and separate fruits, nurturing the capacities of beings.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c15_1']	於是八部四眾積年覩聖、曩日修福，遂令五濁障輕大乘機動，至今王城始稱如來出世之大意，破三乘定執之心，闡揚莫二之教、同歸之理。	於是八部四眾積年覩聖、曩日修福，遂令五濁障輕大乘機動，至今王城始稱如來出世之大意，破三乘定執之心，闡揚莫二之教、同歸之理。	Then, the eight groups and the four assemblies, who had seen the sage for many years and cultivated blessings in the past, finally caused the hindrances of the five turbidities to be light and the Mahayana to be activated. Up to now, in the king's city, they began to fulfill the great meaning of the Tathāgata's appearance in the world, to break the minds of the three vehicles that cling to certainty, to expound the teaching of non-duality and the principle of returning to the same, and to proclaim the great meaning of the Tathāgata's appearance in the world.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c17_2']	于時且廢權於往日，談實於當今，明因則收羅萬善以為一因，語果則復倍上數以為極果。	于時且廢權於往日，談實於當今，明因則收羅萬善以為一因，語果則復倍上數以為極果。	Then, the eight groups and the four assemblies, who had seen the sage for many years and cultivated blessings in the past, finally made the hindrances of the five turbidities light and the Mahayana to be activated. Up to now, in the royal city, they began to call the great meaning of the Tathāgata's appearance in the world, to break the minds of the fixed attachments of the three vehicles, to expound the teaching of no second and the principle of returning to the same, and to temporarily abandon the provisional in the past and talk about the real in the present. It clarifies the cause, which gathers myriad wholesome deeds as one cause, and speaks of the fruit, which is again twice the number above as the ultimate fruit.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c18_4']	今言「妙法」者，妙名是絕麁之奇，語法則因果雙談。	今言「妙法」者，妙名是絕麁之奇，語法則因果雙談。	Now, the wonderful Dharma refers to the marvelous name, which is the wonder of transcending coarseness, and the principle, which is the double discussion of cause and effect.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c18_7']	何者？	何者？	What is it?
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c19_8']	昔日佛偏行六度為因，感有為、無為二種之果。	昔日佛偏行六度為因，感有為、無為二種之果。	In the past, the Buddha practiced the six perfections as the cause, and gave rise to the two kinds of fruits of the conditioned and the unconditioned.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c20_9']	若論無為果，只斷分段結使，三界報亡為之果。	若論無為果，只斷分段結使，三界報亡為之果。	If we discuss the fruit of the unconditioned, it only cuts off the afflictions of the segmented existence, and the retribution of the three realms perishes as the fruit.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c22_4']	初言八十、後言七百阿僧祇住世，以己所得傳化未聞，小小益物作有為果用。	初言八十、後言七百阿僧祇住世，以己所得傳化未聞，小小益物作有為果用。	The first mentions eighty, and the latter mentions seven hundred asaṃkhyeya eons of abiding in the world, transmitting what one has attained to those who have not yet heard it, and benefiting beings in a small way, making use of conditioned fruits.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c23_2']	然此因、此果未盡為極之美，稱之曰麁。	然此因、此果未盡為極之美，稱之曰麁。	However, this cause and this fruit are not yet the ultimate beauty, and it is called coarse.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c25_1']	今日明因，總括萬善為同歸之路，將三乘行人度五百嶮難，遂到寶所，亦有二種果。	今日明因，總括萬善為同歸之路，將三乘行人度五百嶮難，遂到寶所，亦有二種果。	Today's explanation of the cause, comprehensively including myriad wholesome deeds as the path of common return, will ferry practitioners of the three vehicles through five hundred dangers and difficulties, finally reaching the treasure site, also having two kinds of fruits.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c26_2']	斷絕三界內外兩因，滅除此彼二報，無為果極。	斷絕三界內外兩因，滅除此彼二報，無為果極。	Severing the two causes within and outside the three realms, extinguishing this and that two retributions, the unconditioned fruit is ultimate.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0572c27_17']	有為果用者，種智一朗佛果齊明，理而推之，于時則應入無餘涅槃至寂然之地。	有為果用者，種智一朗佛果齊明，理而推之，于時則應入無餘涅槃至寂然之地。	As for the conditioned fruit, the single brilliance of the wisdom of the species is equal to the illumination of the Buddha fruit. Reasonably speaking, at that time one should enter the nirvāṇa without remainder and reach the land of utter quiescence.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a04_15']	但大悲之意不限、度人之心無窮，近藉神通之力、遠由大眾萬行之感，遂能延金剛心留住於世，壽命無窮益物無崖，故能常應在三界之中、殊形入六道之內，使見色聞聲之徒生莫二之大福，是則因絕眾麁之名，果極唯精之極，是故因果兩法俱稱為妙法。	但大悲之意不限、度人之心無窮，近藉神通之力、遠由大眾萬行之感，遂能延金剛心留住於世，壽命無窮益物無崖，故能常應在三界之中、殊形入六道之內，使見色聞聲之徒生莫二之大福，是則因絕眾麁之名，果極唯精之極，是故因果兩法俱稱為妙法。	However, the meaning of great compassion is limitless, and the mind of saving people is inexhaustible. Relying on the power of spiritual penetrations, and far caused by the myriad practices of the great assembly, one is able to extend the adamantine mind and remain in the world, with boundless life and benefit, thus always responding within the three realms and entering the six destinies with different forms, enabling those who see form and hear sound to give rise to the great merit of non-duality. This is then the cause of severing the name of myriad coarseness, and the fruit of the ultimate perfection of the ultimate. Therefore, both cause and effect are called the Wonderful Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a08_8']	「蓮華」者，外譬一物必花實俱有，若談蓮家之花則如果家之因，若語花家之蓮則如因家之果，是故此經家要雙明一乘因果似若此花，故借譬受名，故云蓮花。	「蓮華」者，外譬一物必花實俱有，若談蓮家之花則如果家之因，若語花家之蓮則如因家之果，是故此經家要雙明一乘因果似若此花，故借譬受名，故云蓮花。	Lotus is an external analogy of a single thing that must have both flowers and fruits. If discussing the lotus flower, it is like the cause of the fruit. If speaking of the lotus of the flower, it is like the fruit of the cause. Therefore, this sutra must clarify the cause and effect of the One Vehicle, which is similar to this flower. Thus, borrowing the analogy to receive the name, it is called the Lotus.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a09_4']	「經」者，蓋是佛教之通名、聖語之別號。	「經」者，蓋是佛教之通名、聖語之別號。	Sutra is the general name for the Buddha's teachings and a specific term for the sacred words.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a09_16']	然經之為義，本訓常訓法。	然經之為義，本訓常訓法。	As for the meaning of sutra, it originally means permanence and Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a10_10']	常是不壞之稱，法是可軌為目。	常是不壞之稱，法是可軌為目。	Permanence is a designation of indestructibility, and Dharma is a term for what can be followed.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a12_15']	欲明詮之教不可移易，先聖後聖不能改其長度，天魔外道不可爼壞此法，令其不害理，故稱為常。	欲明詮之教不可移易，先聖後聖不能改其長度，天魔外道不可爼壞此法，令其不害理，故稱為常。	It clarifies that the teachings that are expounded cannot be changed, and the sages of the past and present cannot alter their length. The celestial demons and non-Buddhists cannot destroy this Dharma, causing it to harm the principle, and therefore it is called permanent.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a13_15']	從之者則離惡行善、出凡登聖，故稱為法也。	從之者則離惡行善、出凡登聖，故稱為法也。	Those who follow it then leave evil and practice good, leaving the ordinary and attaining the sacred, and therefore it is called Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a15_14']	然經中正明因辨果，但因果兩法喻若蓮花，今舉所明理以目此教，故言妙法蓮花經也。	然經中正明因辨果，但因果兩法喻若蓮花，今舉所明理以目此教，故言妙法蓮花經也。	However, the sutra mainly clarifies the cause and reveals the effect, but the two dharmas of cause and effect are likened to a lotus flower. Now, taking the principle that is being clarified as the title of this teaching, it is called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a16_1']	次辨廣釋。	次辨廣釋。	Next, it is distinguished and explained in detail.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a16_12']	前敘大意竟，次更細解。	前敘大意竟，次更細解。	The general meaning was explained before, and next, it is further finely understood.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a16_15']	何者？	何者？	What is it?
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a18_7']	今言妙法者，是因果相待之名，對昔為論，昔日因果俱麁，今日因果俱妙也。	今言妙法者，是因果相待之名，對昔為論，昔日因果俱麁，今日因果俱妙也。	Now, the term wonderful Dharma is a name based on cause and effect, discussed in contrast to the past. In the past, cause and effect were both coarse, but today, cause and effect are both wonderful.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a18_17']	先明兩因，後辨二果。	先明兩因，後辨二果。	First, clarify the two causes, and then distinguish the two fruits.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a20_2']	相待之名但今日稱妙備有三義，昔日稱麁亦備三義。	相待之名但今日稱妙備有三義，昔日稱麁亦備三義。	The name based on contrast is only called wonderful today and is equipped with three meanings. In the past, it was called coarse and was also equipped with three meanings.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a21_13']	言今日備三義者，一明今日因體長故稱妙，即對昔日因體短故稱麁。	言今日備三義者，一明今日因體長故稱妙，即對昔日因體短故稱麁。	As for being equipped with three meanings today, first, it clarifies that today's cause is long and therefore called wonderful, which is in contrast to the fact that the cause was short in the past and therefore called coarse.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a22_17']	二者明今日因義廣故稱妙，即對昔日因義狹故稱麁。	二者明今日因義廣故稱妙，即對昔日因義狹故稱麁。	Second, it clarifies that today's cause is broad and therefore called wonderful, which is in contrast to the fact that the cause was narrow in the past and therefore called coarse.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a24_4']	三者明今日因用勝故稱妙，即對昔日因用劣故稱麁。	三者明今日因用勝故稱妙，即對昔日因用劣故稱麁。	Third, it clarifies that today's cause is superior in function and therefore called wonderful, which is in contrast to the fact that the cause was inferior in function in the past and therefore called coarse.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a25_18']	所言今日體長昔日因體短者，昔日止修三界治道為因，不及三界外治道。	所言今日體長昔日因體短者，昔日止修三界治道為因，不及三界外治道。	As for the statement that today's essence is long and the cause's essence was short in the past, in the past, the practice of the path of treatment in the three realms was only cultivated as the cause, not reaching the path of treatment outside the three realms.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a27_1']	且自當昔日之時，不道更有三界外之治道也。	且自當昔日之時，不道更有三界外之治道也。	Moreover, in the past, it was not said that there is a path of practice outside the three realms.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573a29_8']	今日長者，縱論自發心以上迄金剛以還，三界內外治道，一切萬善以為因體，此則今長故妙、昔短故麁。	今日長者，縱論自發心以上迄金剛以還，三界內外治道，一切萬善以為因體，此則今長故妙、昔短故麁。	Today, the elder, even discussing from the initial arousal of the mind up to the diamond stage, the path of practice within and outside the three realms, all myriad wholesome practices as the essence of the cause, this is now long and therefore wonderful, and the past was short and therefore coarse.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b01_17']	復言廣狹相對者，昔止言偏行六度不及其餘諸行，此則是狹義也。	復言廣狹相對者，昔止言偏行六度不及其餘諸行，此則是狹義也。	Again, speaking of the relative meaning of broad and narrow, in the past, it only said that practicing the six perfections exclusively is not as good as the other practices, this is the meaning of narrow.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b02_19']	今日明因橫論，是善遍行逢福盡修，此是廣義。	今日明因橫論，是善遍行逢福盡修，此是廣義。	Today, it is explained that the cause is discussed horizontally, and it is the practice of all wholesome dharmas that encounters the exhaustion of blessings and cultivates, this is the meaning of broad.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b03_9']	今廣稱妙，昔狹稱麁。	今廣稱妙，昔狹稱麁。	Now, the broad is called wonderful, and the narrow of the past is called coarse.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b04_9']	第三言用有勝劣相對義者，但煩惱有二種：	第三言用有勝劣相對義者，但煩惱有二種：	The third speaks of the relative meaning of superiority and inferiority in terms of function. There are only two kinds of afflictions:
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b05_6']	一是四住地煩惱，二是無明住地煩惱。	一是四住地煩惱，二是無明住地煩惱。	The first is the afflictions of the four abodes, and the second is the afflictions of the abode of ignorance.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b06_16']	但昔日因力止斷四住煩惱，不及無明住地煩惱，此是用劣之義也。	但昔日因力止斷四住煩惱，不及無明住地煩惱，此是用劣之義也。	But in the past, the power of the cause only eliminated the afflictions of the four abodes, and did not reach the afflictions of the abode of ignorance, this is the meaning of inferior function.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b08_7']	今日非唯止斷四住煩惱，亦斷無明住地煩惱，此是用勝之義也。	今日非唯止斷四住煩惱，亦斷無明住地煩惱，此是用勝之義也。	Today not only does it stop the four abodes of afflictions, it also cuts off the afflictions of the ground of nescience. This is the meaning of the superiority of its function.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b09_1']	是故今昔兩因麁妙如此也。	是故今昔兩因麁妙如此也。	Therefore, the coarse and subtle of the two causes of today and the past are like this.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b09_12']	今果對昔果亦各有三義。	今果對昔果亦各有三義。	Now, the fruit of today compared to the fruit of the past also each has three meanings.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b09_19']	今果有三義者：	今果有三義者：	The three meanings of the fruit of today are:
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b10_15']	一明今日果體長，即對昔日果體短。	一明今日果體長，即對昔日果體短。	First, clarifying that the substance of the fruit of today is long, which corresponds to the short substance of the fruit of yesterday.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b11_13']	第二義言今日果義廣，即對昔日果義狹。	第二義言今日果義廣，即對昔日果義狹。	The second meaning says that the meaning of the fruit of today is broad, which corresponds to the narrow meaning of the fruit of yesterday.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b12_13']	第三義言今日果用勝，即對昔日果用劣也。	第三義言今日果用勝，即對昔日果用劣也。	The third meaning says that the function of the fruit of today is superior, which corresponds to the inferior function of the fruit of yesterday.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b17_16']	所以言今日果體長者，但昔言果止言壽命八十七百阿僧祇，今日明果壽命長遠復倍為數，是故下經文言壽命無數劫久修業所得，取五百那由他阿僧祇三千大千國土墨點取為喻，言壽命復過於此，但昔日無有如此之壽。	所以言今日果體長者，但昔言果止言壽命八十七百阿僧祇，今日明果壽命長遠復倍為數，是故下經文言壽命無數劫久修業所得，取五百那由他阿僧祇三千大千國土墨點取為喻，言壽命復過於此，但昔日無有如此之壽。	Therefore, it is said that the fruition body of today is long. In the past, it was only said that the lifespan was eighty-seven hundred asaṃkhyeya kalpas. Today, it is clarified that the lifespan is even longer, with a number of times. Therefore, the sutra text below says that the lifespan is innumerable kalpas, obtained through cultivating for a long time. Taking the ink dots of five hundred nayuta asaṃkhyeya trichiliocosms as a metaphor, it is said that the lifespan surpasses this. But in the past, there was no such lifespan.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b20_11']	然羅漢、辟支不無邊際智所延之壽，然終自無有長遠之期，是故以今日長遠之果對昔日短促之壽，昔麁今妙其義如此。	然羅漢、辟支不無邊際智所延之壽，然終自無有長遠之期，是故以今日長遠之果對昔日短促之壽，昔麁今妙其義如此。	However, arhats and pratyekabuddhas do not have the lifespan extended by the knowledge of the ultimate, but they themselves do not have a long-lasting period. Therefore, today's long-lasting fruition is contrasted with the short-lived lifespan of the past. The meaning is like this.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b22_17']	第二言廣狹相對，但昔無為果不足，只有斷分段生死無為而已，今日斷兩種生死故，無為為具足也。	第二言廣狹相對，但昔無為果不足，只有斷分段生死無為而已，今日斷兩種生死故，無為為具足也。	Second, it is said that the broad and narrow are mutually opposed. But in the past, the unconditioned fruition was insufficient. There was only the unconditioned of severing the birth and death of the segmented body. Today, because the two kinds of birth and death are severed, the unconditioned is complete.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b25_11']	昔日有為果體有功德智慧，然功德未圓、智慧未備，唯照有量聖諦不照無量聖諦，亦可唯照三因三果不照一因一果也。	昔日有為果體有功德智慧，然功德未圓、智慧未備，唯照有量聖諦不照無量聖諦，亦可唯照三因三果不照一因一果也。	In the past, the essence of conditioned fruits had merits and wisdom, but the merits were not yet complete and the wisdom was not yet fully developed. It only illuminated the limited holy truths and did not illuminate the immeasurable holy truths, and it could only illuminate the three causes and three fruits and not the one cause and one fruit.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b26_4']	唯有盡無生智為體義狹。	唯有盡無生智為體義狹。	It only had the essence of the wisdom of exhaustion and non-arising, which is narrow in meaning.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b27_13']	功德未圓者，但慈悲三界內眾生不及三界外眾生，故稱未圓也。	功德未圓者，但慈悲三界內眾生不及三界外眾生，故稱未圓也。	As for the merits not yet complete, it only had compassion for sentient beings within the three realms and did not reach sentient beings outside the three realms, so it is called not yet complete.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573b29_15']	今日明有為果智照八諦，復照一因一果功德，為論慈悲於內外眾生，故功德智慧圓而且備。	今日明有為果智照八諦，復照一因一果功德，為論慈悲於內外眾生，故功德智慧圓而且備。	Today, it is explained that the wisdom of conditioned fruits illuminates the eight truths and also illuminates the one cause and one fruit, and it is discussed that compassion towards internal and external sentient beings is complete and fully developed.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573c01_7']	然今廣故妙、昔狹故麁。	然今廣故妙、昔狹故麁。	However, because it is extensive now, it is wonderful, and because it was narrow in the past, it is coarse.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573c05_17']	第三明果用勝劣相對者，然此果更無別用，祇是殊形萬象神通益物，下文言神通力如是於阿僧祇劫常在靈鷲山及餘諸住處，非唯止在靈鷲益物，亦復分身十方度人，見形者三毒滅，聞聲者四倒除。	第三明果用勝劣相對者，然此果更無別用，祇是殊形萬象神通益物，下文言神通力如是於阿僧祇劫常在靈鷲山及餘諸住處，非唯止在靈鷲益物，亦復分身十方度人，見形者三毒滅，聞聲者四倒除。	Third, clarifying the superiority and inferiority of the effects, the function is as follows: This effect has no other function, it is just the extraordinary form and spiritual powers benefiting beings among the myriad phenomena. The text below says, The power of spiritual powers is like this, always on Vulture Peak and in other abodes for incalculably long eons. It is not only staying on Vulture Peak to benefit beings, it also manifests bodies in the ten directions to liberate people. Those who see the form have their three poisons extinguished, and those who hear the sound have their four inverted views eliminated.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573c09_3']	但昔日之果不無小小說法，然不足是語，是故以今日神通無方益物之用勝，對昔日之用劣，昔劣今勝，劣者為麁、勝者稱妙，二名相待其意如此。	但昔日之果不無小小說法，然不足是語，是故以今日神通無方益物之用勝，對昔日之用劣，昔劣今勝，劣者為麁、勝者稱妙，二名相待其意如此。	But the effects of the past are not without a little bit of teaching the Dharma, but it is not enough to speak of. Therefore, the function of benefiting beings with the boundless spiritual powers of today is superior, contrasting with the inferior function of the past. The inferior of the past is coarse, and the superior is called wonderful. The two names are mutually dependent in this way.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0573c09_17']	又復作一種解，因果各判為三。	又復作一種解，因果各判為三。	Moreover, another kind of understanding is made, with cause and effect each divided into three.

However, beginner bodhisattvas are not yet able to do this, and so they give rise to thoughts of retreat and discouragement regarding the path of spreading the sūtra. Therefore, the Tathāgata encourages people, saying that if one is unable to sacrifice one's life to protect the Dharma and spread the sūtra to transform others, one can still personally uphold, recite, and chant it. Personally upholding, reciting, and chanting is precisely the self-propagation of the practice.

['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b02_3']	又七心以上六地以還，亦有不退之義，位登信首五根不復流轉，乃至初地以上六地以還，心會無相之境、意入二諦之中，是故《維摩經》言：	又七心以上六地以還，亦有不退之義，位登信首五根不復流轉，乃至初地以上六地以還，心會無相之境、意入二諦之中，是故《維摩經》言：	Moreover, above the seven minds and below the six grounds, there is also the meaning of non-retrogression. Once one attains the head of faith, the five roots no longer transmigrate, and up to the first ground and below the sixth ground, the mind accords with the realm of signlessness and the intention enters the two truths. Therefore, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says:
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b02_13']	「受不退，常寂然」。	「受不退，常寂然」。	Accepting non-retrogression, always in quiescence.

['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b05_11']	一明入忍之行相似無漏無得而失，二明二諦之念不恒現在前，是故受行退之名也。	一明入忍之行相似無漏無得而失，二明二諦之念不恒現在前，是故受行退之名也。	First, it clarifies the practice of entering patience, which is similar to the undefiled but may be lost due to non-attainment. Second, it clarifies that the thought of the two truths is not always present in front of one. Therefore, it accepts the name of practice retrogression.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b08_13']	七地菩薩位登初忍實無退失，入忍諸行興心即得，但雜相煩惱未盡，猶有出入觀異，致令二諦明解不恒現在前，故受念退之名也。	七地菩薩位登初忍實無退失，入忍諸行興心即得，但雜相煩惱未盡，猶有出入觀異，致令二諦明解不恒現在前，故受念退之名也。	The bodhisattva of the seventh ground, having attained the first patience, truly has no retrogression. Entering patience, all practices arise with the mind and are attained. However, the afflictions of mixed characteristics have not yet been exhausted, and there is still a difference between entering and exiting contemplation, causing the clear understanding of the two truths to not always be present in front of one. Therefore, it accepts the name of thought retrogression.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b10_12']	今明八地以上菩薩永絕下地三種退義，位登法流長不出觀，念念皆明，豈有念退？	今明八地以上菩薩永絕下地三種退義，位登法流長不出觀，念念皆明，豈有念退？	Now, it clarifies that the bodhisattvas above the eighth ground forever cut off the three kinds of retrogressions of the lower grounds. Their position ascends to the Dharma stream and they never leave the contemplation. Moment by moment they are all illuminated. How could there be retrogression in thought?
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b11_1']	所以爾者，有其二義：	所以爾者，有其二義：	There are two reasons for this:

['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b14_17']	所以言於三菩提不退者，三菩提者正遍知道也，道者即是因也，正明此諸菩薩於無上正遍知因中不復退轉也。	所以言於三菩提不退者，三菩提者正遍知道也，道者即是因也，正明此諸菩薩於無上正遍知因中不復退轉也。	The reason it says not retrogressing from the supreme perfect enlightenment is that supreme perfect enlightenment is the path of right and universal knowledge. The path is precisely the cause. It clearly shows that these bodhisattvas no longer retrogress from the cause of supreme perfect enlightenment.

['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b20_20']	所以為兩雙者，前二是德行，後二是體名。	所以為兩雙者，前二是德行，後二是體名。	The reason for the two pairs is that the first two are virtues and practices, and the latter two are essence and name.
['ZH_T33_1715_001:0580b25_1']	所以先歎德行後歎體名者，夫言體名則善惡通有、凡聖皆然，如來有體闡提不無，若言佛最善人便有體者，則闡提極惡應無有體，而今佛與闡提皆有體者，故知好惡不在體也。	所以先歎德行後歎體名者，夫言體名則善惡通有、凡聖皆然，如來有體闡提不無，若言佛最善人便有體者，則闡提極惡應無有體，而今佛與闡提皆有體者，故知好惡不在體也。	The reason for first praising virtues and practices and then praising the essence and name is that as for speaking of essence and name, good and evil both have it, and ordinary and holy people all have it. The Tathāgata has an essence, and icchantikas are not without it. If it is said that the Buddha, as the most virtuous person, has an essence, then icchantikas, as the most evil, should not have an essence. But now both the Buddha and icchantikas have an essence, so we know that goodness and evil do not depend on the essence.

The wonderful reputation of the Tathāgata spreads far and wide, and the evil name of icchantikas is known throughout the world. Therefore, essence and name are common to both ordinary and holy people.
