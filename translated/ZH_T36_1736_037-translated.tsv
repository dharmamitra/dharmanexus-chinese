['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a09_19']	疏「然即緣因即是了因」下，第二揀定二因。	疏「然即緣因即是了因」下，第二揀定二因。	The commentary states: The conditional cause is precisely the realizing cause. The second is the distinction between the two causes.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a10_3']	於中有二：	於中有二：	Within this, there are two parts:
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a10_8']	先標二別。	先標二別。	First, it outlines the two differences.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a11_17']	「因有親疎者」，總示別義，疎者是了亦是緣因，親者是了非是緣因。	「因有親疎者」，總示別義，疎者是了亦是緣因，親者是了非是緣因。	The cause has intimacy and distance generally indicates the meaning of the distinction. The distant one is the realizing cause and also the conditional cause. The intimate one is the realizing cause but not the conditional cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a12_17']	疏「善友是緣因而必是了」下，出其二相。	疏「善友是緣因而必是了」下，出其二相。	The commentary states: The good friend is the conditional cause and must be the realizing cause. This brings out the two aspects.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a14_1']	善友是疎亦緣亦了，如酵暖等是酪了因亦是緣因。	善友是疎亦緣亦了，如酵暖等是酪了因亦是緣因。	The good friend is the distant one, the conditional cause, and the realizing cause. For example, yeast, warmth, etc. are the realizing causes of yogurt and also the conditional causes.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a15_18']	疏「佛性名為了因未必是緣，此約智慧性故」者，顯上了因未必是緣，以是親因故。	疏「佛性名為了因未必是緣，此約智慧性故」者，顯上了因未必是緣，以是親因故。	The commentary states: The Buddha-nature is called the realizing cause but is not necessarily the conditional cause. This is based on the nature of wisdom. This shows that the realizing cause is not necessarily the conditional cause, because it is the intimate cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a18_1']	言智慧性故者，亦是了相，以無漏智性本自具足，本有真實識知遍照法界義故，當體名了。	言智慧性故者，亦是了相，以無漏智性本自具足，本有真實識知遍照法界義故，當體名了。	As for the phrase the nature of wisdom, this also refers to the revealing characteristic, because the nature of uncontaminated wisdom is originally complete, and the meaning of the originally existent true cognition that universally illuminates the Dharma realm is used as the name of the essence itself.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a18_11']	又約行性，居然是了。	又約行性，居然是了。	Moreover, in terms of the nature of practice, it is clearly the revealing characteristic.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a20_17']	又上所引生了二因中，云六度阿耨多羅三藐三菩提是名生因，佛性阿耨多羅三藐三菩提是名了因；	又上所引生了二因中，云六度阿耨多羅三藐三菩提是名生因，佛性阿耨多羅三藐三菩提是名了因；	Moreover, in the two causes of production and revealing that were cited above, it says that the six perfections and anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi are called the cause of production, and buddha-nature and anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi are called the revealing cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a22_17']	六度能生菩提故為菩提生因，佛性能了菩提故為菩提了因，明知佛性之體即是了因。	六度能生菩提故為菩提生因，佛性能了菩提故為菩提了因，明知佛性之體即是了因。	Because the six perfections can produce bodhi, they are the cause of the production of bodhi. Because buddha-nature can reveal bodhi, it is the revealing cause of bodhi. It is clear that the essence of buddha-nature is precisely the revealing cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a24_4']	疏「若以第一義空為佛性者，唯是正因」者，揀異智慧性也。	疏「若以第一義空為佛性者，唯是正因」者，揀異智慧性也。	The commentary says, If the ultimate emptiness is taken as buddha-nature, it is only the correct cause, distinguishing it from the nature of wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a25_17']	然《涅槃》云「佛性者名第一義空，第一義空名為智慧，此二不二以為佛性。	然《涅槃》云「佛性者名第一義空，第一義空名為智慧，此二不二以為佛性。	However, the Nirvana Sutra says, Buddha-nature is called ultimate emptiness, and ultimate emptiness is called wisdom. These two non-dualities are taken as buddha-nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a26_18']	」然第一義空是佛性性，名為智慧，即佛性相。	」然第一義空是佛性性，名為智慧，即佛性相。	However, the emptiness of ultimate truth is the nature of buddha-nature, which is called wisdom, which is the characteristic of buddha-nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a28_3']	第一義空不在智慧但名法性，由在智慧故名佛性。	第一義空不在智慧但名法性，由在智慧故名佛性。	The emptiness of ultimate truth, not being in wisdom, is only called the nature of dharmas. Because it is in wisdom, it is called buddha-nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280a29_6']	若以性從相，則唯眾生得有佛性，有智慧故。	若以性從相，則唯眾生得有佛性，有智慧故。	If one takes the characteristic to follow the nature, then only sentient beings have buddha-nature, because they have wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b01_1']	牆壁瓦礫無有智慧，故無佛性。	牆壁瓦礫無有智慧，故無佛性。	Walls, tiles, and pebbles do not have wisdom, so they do not have buddha-nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b02_13']	若以相從性，第一義空無所不在，則牆壁等皆是第一義空，云何非性？	若以相從性，第一義空無所不在，則牆壁等皆是第一義空，云何非性？	If one takes the nature to follow the characteristic, the emptiness of ultimate truth is everywhere, then walls and so forth are all the emptiness of ultimate truth. How could they not be the nature?
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b04_10']	故下經云「知一切法即心自性」，論云「以色性即智性故，色體無形說名智身；	故下經云「知一切法即心自性」，論云「以色性即智性故，色體無形說名智身；	Therefore, the sutra below says, Knowing that all dharmas are the self-nature of the mind, and the treatise says, Because the nature of form is the nature of cognition, the essence of form is formless and is called the body of cognition;
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b05_4']	以智性即色性故，說名法身。	以智性即色性故，說名法身。	Because the nature of cognition is the nature of form, it is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b05_14']	偏一切處，明體本均。	偏一切處，明體本均。	It is clear that everywhere, the essence is originally equal.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b06_4']	」今分性相，故分二義。	」今分性相，故分二義。	Now, dividing the nature and characteristics, the two meanings are divided.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b08_1']	疏「若以智慧為佛性者，即是了因」者，結成上義，生下五蘊是正是生，不得名了。	疏「若以智慧為佛性者，即是了因」者，結成上義，生下五蘊是正是生，不得名了。	The commentary states: If wisdom is taken as buddha-nature, it is the revealing cause - this concludes the above meaning and gives rise to the five aggregates being the correct cause of birth, which cannot be called the revealing cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b08_17']	五蘊名生者，能生諸法，故名生因。	五蘊名生者，能生諸法，故名生因。	The five aggregates are called birth because they can give rise to all dharmas, and are therefore called the causal basis of birth.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b09_12']	今因五蘊能得菩提，豈非生因？	今因五蘊能得菩提，豈非生因？	Now, since the five aggregates can attain bodhi, aren't they the causal basis of birth?
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b10_9']	如乳生酪、如穀生芽，皆生因故。	如乳生酪、如穀生芽，皆生因故。	It is like milk giving rise to yogurt, and like grains giving rise to sprouts, all of which are causal bases of birth.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b12_9']	疏「然復生必對了、正必對緣」者，以疏參用為順今經，依《涅槃》明義有二對，並如上引。	疏「然復生必對了、正必對緣」者，以疏參用為順今經，依《涅槃》明義有二對，並如上引。	The commentary states: However, birth must correspond to revealing, and the correct must correspond to conditions - this is because the commentary uses both [the Lotus Sutra and Nirvana Sutra] to accord with the present sutra. According to the Nirvana Sutra, there are two pairs of correspondences, both of which are cited above.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b13_15']	疏「今燈一喻雙喻緣了」下，第三結示喻旨兼指理源。	疏「今燈一喻雙喻緣了」下，第三結示喻旨兼指理源。	The commentary states: Now, the single lamp metaphor metaphorically illustrates both conditions and revealing - this is the third point, which concludes the meaning of the metaphor and also points to the source of principle.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b14_20']	「即涅槃二十六七」者，此是南經，北經即當二十八九。	「即涅槃二十六七」者，此是南經，北經即當二十八九。	That is, the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh chapters of the Nirvana Sutra - this is the Southern edition, and the Northern edition would be the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth chapters.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b16_3']	疏「又上燈喻既是正義」下，第二引難成立，亦二十八。	疏「又上燈喻既是正義」下，第二引難成立，亦二十八。	The commentary states, Moreover, the lamp analogy above is the correct principle. The second is introducing difficulties to establish, also twenty-eight.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b16_8']	疏文有二：	疏文有二：	The commentary has two parts:
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b17_1']	先引經立難、後決擇經意。	先引經立難、後決擇經意。	First, introducing the sutra to establish difficulties, and later discerning the meaning of the sutra.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b17_5']	前中二：	前中二：	The former has two parts:
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b17_16']	先師子吼立、後如來難。	先師子吼立、後如來難。	First, the lion's roar establishes, and later the Tathagata presents difficulties.
['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b18_6']	然疏引文，隨要略引。	然疏引文，隨要略引。	However, the commentary quotes the text, following the essentials and briefly quoting.

['ZH_T36_1736_037:0280b21_3']	一者正因、二者緣因。	一者正因、二者緣因。	The first is the direct cause, and the second is the enabling cause.

It is clear that it is in order for the samādhi that the vow is made and the empowerment is bestowed, which shows that the vow is the cause of the samādhi.

First, based on the current text, this is the empowerment of the Buddhas of the ten directions together empowering you. This is the aspect of empowerment.
