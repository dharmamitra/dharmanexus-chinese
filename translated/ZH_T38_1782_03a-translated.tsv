['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b18_15']	一境、二行、三果，並同〈菩薩地〉，謂先要知所學之處，次應依彼如是而學，然後方成能修學者。	一境、二行、三果，並同〈菩薩地〉，謂先要知所學之處，次應依彼如是而學，然後方成能修學者。	03a	First, the object; second, practice; third, fruition. They are the same as the Bodhisattvabhūmi, which states: First, one must know the place to be learned; next, one should rely on that and learn in this way; then one will be able to accomplish the one who is able to cultivate and learn.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b21_3']	若不識知苦樂善惡、凡聖真妄一切境界，不能發起厭苦欣樂、修善斷惡、捨凡就聖、證真離妄種種勝行。	若不識知苦樂善惡、凡聖真妄一切境界，不能發起厭苦欣樂、修善斷惡、捨凡就聖、證真離妄種種勝行。	03a	If one does not recognize the realms of suffering and happiness, good and evil, ordinary and holy, true and false, one will not be able to give rise to the various superior practices of being weary of suffering and delighting in happiness, cultivating good and cutting off evil, abandoning the ordinary and approaching the holy, realizing the true and leaving falsity.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b21_13']	行既不修，果何以獲？	行既不修，果何以獲？	03a	Since practice is not cultivated, how can fruition be attained?

['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b23_16']	此經正宗明大乘理，故從〈方便〉終至〈香臺〉，此九品是菩薩境；	此經正宗明大乘理，故從〈方便〉終至〈香臺〉，此九品是菩薩境；	03a	The correct purport of this sūtra clarifies the principle of the Great Vehicle, therefore, from the chapter on skillful means to the chapter on the Fragrant Palace, these nine chapters are the realm of the bodhisattva;
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b24_7']	次〈菩薩行〉一品，是菩薩行；	次〈菩薩行〉一品，是菩薩行；	03a	Next, the chapter on Bodhisattva Practice is the practice of bodhisattvas;

['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b26_10']	一所化處，此〈觀有情品〉是，一切眾生為所化故。	一所化處，此〈觀有情品〉是，一切眾生為所化故。	03a	First, the realm of those to be transformed, which is this chapter on Contemplating Sentient Beings, because all sentient beings are to be transformed.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b27_21']	二利行處，〈方便品〉、〈聲聞品〉、〈菩薩品〉、〈問疾品〉是，利他行故。	二利行處，〈方便品〉、〈聲聞品〉、〈菩薩品〉、〈問疾品〉是，利他行故。	03a	Second, the realm of benefiting others, which includes the chapters on Skillful Means, Voice-Hearers, Bodhisattvas, and Inquiring about Illness, because they are practices for benefiting others.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033b29_7']	三真實義處，〈菩提分品〉、〈不二法門品〉是，盡所有性、如所有情，等道理故。	三真實義處，〈菩提分品〉、〈不二法門品〉是，盡所有性、如所有情，等道理故。	03a	Third, the realm of ultimate truth, which includes the chapters on Factors of Enlightenment and Non-dual Dharma Door, because they accord with the principle of the nature of all that exists and the reality of things as they are.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c01_5']	四威力處，〈不思議品〉是，神通威力等故。	四威力處，〈不思議品〉是，神通威力等故。	03a	Fourth, the realm of spiritual power, which is the chapter on The Inconceivable, because it is about the spiritual power of spiritual penetrations and so forth.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c02_4']	五菩提處，〈香臺品〉是，明佛所有殊勝德故。	五菩提處，〈香臺品〉是，明佛所有殊勝德故。	03a	Fifth, the realm of enlightenment, which is the chapter on The Fragrant Palace, because it clarifies the exceptional virtues possessed by the Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c03_7']	〈菩薩地〉云「最先應達所化機宜，方名發起利他勝行。	〈菩薩地〉云「最先應達所化機宜，方名發起利他勝行。	03a	The Bodhisattvabhūmi says: First one should understand the capacities of those to be converted, and only then can one be said to initiate the superior practices for benefiting others.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c04_7']	次知實義，可斷可修，於威力門修成自利。	次知實義，可斷可修，於威力門修成自利。	03a	Next, knowing the true meaning, what can be eliminated and what can be cultivated, one cultivates one's own benefit in the gateway of spiritual powers.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c05_7']	次於果位無上菩提，愛樂希求，精勤修證。	次於果位無上菩提，愛樂希求，精勤修證。	03a	Next, in the stage of fruition, unsurpassed enlightenment, one loves and aspires for it, diligently cultivating and realizing it.

Among the nine categories of objects, the bodhisattva's cultivation of benefiting others is foremost. Therefore, the first five categories clarify the practice of benefiting others, because the gateway of spiritual powers is common to benefiting others and because spiritual powers are only for benefiting others.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c09_12']	恐言他利有實眾生，今破執真，顯皆非實，唯有情情以為所利，故次一品明所化處。	恐言他利有實眾生，今破執真，顯皆非實，唯有情情以為所利，故次一品明所化處。	03a	Fearing that benefiting others would have real sentient beings, now refuting attachment to truth, it is shown that they are all unreal, only having the feelings of sentient beings as those to be benefited. Therefore, the next category clarifies the realm of those to be converted.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c11_2']	他利既周，應修自利，故次二品明真實義處，此二門中修自利故。	他利既周，應修自利，故次二品明真實義處，此二門中修自利故。	03a	Since benefiting others is complete, one should cultivate one's own benefit. Therefore, the next two categories clarify the realm of true meaning, because in these two gateways one cultivates one's own benefit.
['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1033c12_1']	從於果德愛樂希求，故次一品明菩提處。	從於果德愛樂希求，故次一品明菩提處。	03a	Because one loves and aspires for the fruition of the virtues, the next chapter clarifies the place of enlightenment.

['ZH_T38_1782_03a:1035c29_3']	故《瑜伽》云「又不思惟彼相，但於外色而作勝解，即觀少多不作光明等。	故《瑜伽》云「又不思惟彼相，但於外色而作勝解，即觀少多不作光明等。	03a	Therefore the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says: Moreover, not contemplating their characteristics, but only in external colors one makes the resolve, and observes few or many, not making light, etc.
