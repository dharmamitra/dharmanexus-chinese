['ZH_T36_1736_016:0122a01_2']	又前從下釋上，故先明教義；	又前從下釋上，故先明教義；	016	Moreover, the previous one clarifies the upper based on the lower, so it clarifies the teachings and principles first;
['ZH_T36_1736_016:0122a01_14']	今從上釋下，故後明教義。	今從上釋下，故後明教義。	016	Now it clarifies the lower based on the upper, so it clarifies the teachings and principles later.
['ZH_T36_1736_016:0122a03_16']	而前五對中，後明人中因果者，以因是華字，借喻中華，故在後明，前從寬至狹義已盡故。	而前五對中，後明人中因果者，以因是華字，借喻中華，故在後明，前從寬至狹義已盡故。	016	And the reason why the previous five pairs clarify the causes and effects among people later is because the causes are the word flower, which borrows the metaphor of the flower, so it is clarified later, and the meaning of going from broad to narrow in the previous has already been exhausted.

['ZH_T36_1736_016:0122a11_1']	疏「教望於義」下，謂四對之中，後二對中通於三釋，謂經中有大方廣佛華嚴故，如《對法藏論》，全取他名以目經故。	疏「教望於義」下，謂四對之中，後二對中通於三釋，謂經中有大方廣佛華嚴故，如《對法藏論》，全取他名以目經故。	016	The commentary below The teaching is based on the meaning means that among the four pairs, the latter two pairs are common to the three explanations. This is because there is Mahāvaipulya Buddhâvataṃsaka in the sūtra, because the Treatise on the Treasury of Abhidharma completely takes the name of another to refer to the sūtra.
