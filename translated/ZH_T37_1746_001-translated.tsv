['ZH_T37_1746_001:0117a12_3']	今所以解言非次第教者，此經已談一乘之因、盛說菩提之業，故知非初教，是故當知是偏方別教也。	今所以解言非次第教者，此經已談一乘之因、盛說菩提之業，故知非初教，是故當知是偏方別教也。	001	Now, the reason why it is explained that this sūtra is not a sequential teaching is because this sūtra has already discussed the cause of the One Vehicle and extensively expounds the practices leading to enlightenment.
