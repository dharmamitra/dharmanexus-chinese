['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c11_7']	理事故有教，由教故有行，由行故有縛脫，由脫故成因果，由果故體顯能用，故有漸頓之化，由開漸頓故有於開合，開合故有通別之益，分別兩益故有四悉檀，是為十章次第云云。	理事故有教，由教故有行，由行故有縛脫，由脫故成因果，由果故體顯能用，故有漸頓之化，由開漸頓故有於開合，開合故有通別之益，分別兩益故有四悉檀，是為十章次第云云。	Because of principle and phenomena, there is teaching; because of teaching, there is practice; because of practice, there is bondage and liberation; because of liberation, cause and effect are accomplished; because of effect, the essence and ability are revealed, so there is the gradual and sudden transformation; because of unfolding the gradual and sudden, there is unfolding and combining; because of unfolding and combining, there is the benefit of the general and specific; because of distinguishing the two benefits, there are the four siddhāntas. This is the sequence of the ten chapters.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c12_17']	三、解釋者，理是真如，真如本淨，有佛無佛常不變易故，名理為實；	三、解釋者，理是真如，真如本淨，有佛無佛常不變易故，名理為實；	Third, the explanation: principle is suchness. Suchness is originally pure. Whether there are buddhas or not, it always remains unchanged, so it is called the reality of principle;

If there are no phenomena, principle cannot be manifested. Phenomena have the function of manifesting principle, therefore they are earnestly praised as expedient.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c20_5']	理教者，總前理事皆名為理，例如真俗俱稱為諦，諸佛體之而得成聖，聖者正實也，欲以己法下被眾生，因理而設教，教即權也，非教無以顯理，顯理由教，是故如來稱歎方便云云。	理教者，總前理事皆名為理，例如真俗俱稱為諦，諸佛體之而得成聖，聖者正實也，欲以己法下被眾生，因理而設教，教即權也，非教無以顯理，顯理由教，是故如來稱歎方便云云。	Principle and teaching refers to the previous phenomena and principle being collectively called principle. It is analogous to true and conventional being collectively called truth. All Buddhas realize this and attain sagehood. Sage means correct and real. Wishing to use their own Dharma to benefit sentient beings, they establish teachings based on principle. The teachings are expedient, and without the teachings, principle cannot be manifested. Principle is manifested through the teachings, therefore the Tathāgata praises expedient means and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c21_13']	教行者，依教求理則生正行，行有進趣深淺之殊，故行名權也；	教行者，依教求理則生正行，行有進趣深淺之殊，故行名權也；	Teaching and practice means that based on the teachings to seek principle will give rise to correct practice. Practice has differences in progress and depth, therefore practice is called expedient;
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c22_10']	教無進趣深淺之異，故教名實也。	教無進趣深淺之異，故教名實也。	the teachings have no differences in progress and depth, therefore the teachings are called real.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c24_3']	非教無以立行，非行無以會教，會教由行，是故如來稱歎方便云云。	非教無以立行，非行無以會教，會教由行，是故如來稱歎方便云云。	Without teaching, practice cannot be established; without practice, teaching cannot be realized. Realizing teaching through practice, therefore the Tathagata praises skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c25_2']	縛脫者，為行違理則縛，縛是虛妄故稱權；	縛脫者，為行違理則縛，縛是虛妄故稱權；	As for bondage and liberation, if practice goes against principle, it is bondage, and since bondage is false, it is called expedient.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c26_1']	為行順理則生解，解冥於理故稱實。	為行順理則生解，解冥於理故稱實。	If practice accords with principle, it gives rise to understanding, and since understanding merges with principle, it is called true.

Liberation is attained through bondage, like using a corpse to cross the ocean. Since the corpse has the power to reach the shore, it is praised as skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c29_3']	因果者，因有進趣暫用故名權，果有剋終永證故為實。	因果者，因有進趣暫用故名權，果有剋終永證故為實。	As for cause and effect, the cause has temporary use in advancing and progressing, so it is called expedient. The effect has the power of eternal realization, so it is called true.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c29_11']	無果，因無所望；	無果，因無所望；	Without effect, the cause has nothing to aspire to;
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0037c29_19']	無因，果不自顯。	無因，果不自顯。	without cause, the effect does not manifest itself.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a02_13']	是以二觀為方便道，斷惑成因得入中道解脫之果，若非二觀豈契中道？	是以二觀為方便道，斷惑成因得入中道解脫之果，若非二觀豈契中道？	Therefore, the two contemplations are the path of skillful means. Cutting off delusions and perfecting the cause, one enters the effect of liberation in the middle way. If it were not for the two contemplations, how could one accord with the middle way?
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a03_5']	果由因剋，故稱歎方便。	果由因剋，故稱歎方便。	Since the effect is attained through the cause, it is praised as skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a07_17']	體用者，前方便為因，正觀入住為果，住出為體用，體即實相無有分別，用即立一切法差降不同，如大地一生種種芽，非地無以生，非生無以顯，尋流得源推用識體，用有顯體之功，故稱歎方便。	體用者，前方便為因，正觀入住為果，住出為體用，體即實相無有分別，用即立一切法差降不同，如大地一生種種芽，非地無以生，非生無以顯，尋流得源推用識體，用有顯體之功，故稱歎方便。	As for essence and function, the previous expedient means are the cause, and the correct contemplation of entry and abiding are the effect. Abiding and emerging are the essence and function. The essence is the true aspect without discrimination, and the function establishes all dharmas with different levels. It is like the great earth giving birth to various sprouts. Without the earth, there would be no birth. Without birth, there would be no manifestation. By tracing the flow to find the source, one recognizes the essence through the function. The function has the merit of revealing the essence, and therefore the expedient means are praised.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a10_15']	漸頓者，修因證果從體起用，俱有漸頓，今明起用，用漸為權、用頓為實，若非漸引無由入頓，從漸得實，故稱歎方便。	漸頓者，修因證果從體起用，俱有漸頓，今明起用，用漸為權、用頓為實，若非漸引無由入頓，從漸得實，故稱歎方便。	As for gradual and sudden, cultivating the causes and realizing the fruit, arising from the essence and giving rise to the function, both have gradual and sudden aspects. Now, in clarifying the arising of the function, the gradual function is considered provisional, and the sudden function is considered real. If it were not gradually introduced, there would be no way to enter the sudden. By following the gradual, one attains the real, and therefore the expedient means are praised.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a12_1']	開合者，從頓開漸，漸自不合亦不合頓，故名為權；	開合者，從頓開漸，漸自不合亦不合頓，故名為權；	As for opening and combining, opening the sudden to reveal the gradual, the gradual itself does not combine and does not combine with the sudden, and therefore it is considered provisional;
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a12_15']	漸令究竟還合於頓，故名為實。	漸令究竟還合於頓，故名為實。	Gradually leading to the ultimate, it combines with the sudden, and therefore it is considered real.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a13_17']	由開故合，開有合力從開受名，故稱歎方便。	由開故合，開有合力從開受名，故稱歎方便。	Because of the opening, there is the closing. The opening has the power of the closing and receives its name from the opening, thus it is called praising the skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a15_2']	通別益者，通則半字無常之益，別即滿字常住之益。	通別益者，通則半字無常之益，別即滿字常住之益。	As for the general and specific benefits, the general refers to the impermanent benefits of the half-word, and the specific refers to the permanent benefits of the full-word.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a18_1']	然常益道長，喜生退沒故，以化城接引，生安隱想，然後息化引至寶所，若無半益不得會常，半有顯滿之功，故稱歎方便。	然常益道長，喜生退沒故，以化城接引，生安隱想，然後息化引至寶所，若無半益不得會常，半有顯滿之功，故稱歎方便。	However, the path to permanent benefits is long, and joy can lead to discouragement. Therefore, the city of the Buddha's skillful means is used to attract and give rise to a sense of peace and security. Then, the Buddha stops the skillful means and leads them to the treasure site. If there were no half-word benefits, one would not be able to realize permanence. The half-word has the merit of revealing the full-word, thus it is called praising the skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a19_7']	四悉檀者，三是世間是故為權，第一義是出世是故為實。	四悉檀者，三是世間是故為權，第一義是出世是故為實。	As for the four siddhāntas, three are worldly and therefore expedient, and the ultimate truth is supramundane and therefore true.
['ZH_T34_1718_03b:0038a20_14']	非世不得出世，由三悉檀得第一義，是故如來稱歎方便。	非世不得出世，由三悉檀得第一義，是故如來稱歎方便。	Without the worldly, one cannot attain the supramundane. By means of the three siddhāntas, one attains the ultimate truth. Therefore, the Tathāgata praises the skillful means.

Three aspects are the meaning of other sūtras, and one aspect is the meaning of this chapter.Here is the corrected and aligned text:🔽The Lotus Sutra, Fascicle 10, Chapter 10: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 11: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 12: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 13: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 14: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 15: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 16: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 17: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 18: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 19: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 20: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 21: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 22: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come One, Chapter 23: The Lifespan of the Thus-Come

To cite the present sutra, not like the three realms seeing the three realms, the three realms are phenomena, not like the three realms seeing is principle.
