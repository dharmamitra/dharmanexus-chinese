['ZH_T38_1777_002:0524b08_4']	一、釋別名者，此經以「維摩羅詰所說」標名，名異眾經，故云「別」也。	一、釋別名者，此經以「維摩羅詰所說」標名，名異眾經，故云「別」也。	First, explaining the specific name: This sūtra takes Spoken by Vimalakīrti as its title, and the name is different from other sūtras, so it is called specific.
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0524b08_24']	二、釋通名者，「經」之一字，即是通名也。	二、釋通名者，「經」之一字，即是通名也。	Second, explaining the general name: The single character sūtra is the general name.

Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, It is like the Heavenly Emperor having various names.
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0524b16_20']	解脫亦爾，多諸名字，名字異故，故名為「別」。	解脫亦爾，多諸名字，名字異故，故名為「別」。	Liberation is also like this, having many names. Because the names are different, it is called distinct.

['ZH_T38_1777_002:0525a16_3']	若迷此正因緣，則有六道生死；	若迷此正因緣，則有六道生死；	If one is confused about this correct teaching of dependent origination, then there will be the cycle of birth and death in the six realms;

['ZH_T38_1777_002:0529c16_7']	次明真正發心者，三乘行人，明知正因緣所生三界火宅，覺悟生死，志求涅槃；	次明真正發心者，三乘行人，明知正因緣所生三界火宅，覺悟生死，志求涅槃；	Next, clarifying the correct arousal of the mind means that the practitioners of the Three Vehicles clearly understand that the three realms of the burning house arisen from the correct causes and conditions are the realization of birth and death, and they aspire to seek nirvana;
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0529c16_18']	但菩薩大悲濟物心異也。	但菩薩大悲濟物心異也。	But the mind of the bodhisattva's great compassion in saving beings is different.

['ZH_T38_1777_002:0529c20_3']	次明破諸法遍者，若不破見、思兩輪所執妄境不遍，則止觀有滯也。	次明破諸法遍者，若不破見、思兩輪所執妄境不遍，則止觀有滯也。	Next, clarifying the breaking of all dharmas is all-encompassing. If the false objects grasped by the two wheels of views and thoughts are not broken through, then the calming and contemplation will be obstructed.
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0529c21_15']	次明須知通塞者，隨所破法，從淺至深，皆有道、滅之通，苦、集之塞；	次明須知通塞者，隨所破法，從淺至深，皆有道、滅之通，苦、集之塞；	Next, clarifying the need to know the unobstructed and blocked is as follows. According to the broken dharmas, from shallow to deep, there is the unobstructed of the path and cessation, and the blocked of suffering and accumulation;

The thirty-seven factors are the correct essentials for the three vehicles to enter the path, able to lead and advance various practices to the three gates of liberation and enter nirvana.

This refers to the various counteractive methods such as the four dhyanas, four immeasurable minds, four formless concentrations, nine perceptions, eight recollections, ten perceptions, eight emancipations, eight spheres of mastery, ten universal bases, nine successive concentrations, and the six perfections in practice, which assist in opening the three gates of liberation.

If one can distinguish without error, one will not give rise to arrogance and break the mind of conceit.
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0530a02_11']	次明安忍強軟兩賊者，未入外凡之位，內外八風壞三乘行人出世善根；	次明安忍強軟兩賊者，未入外凡之位，內外八風壞三乘行人出世善根；	Next, clarifying the two thieves of strong and soft patience: before entering the stage of outer ordinary people, the eight winds inside and outside destroy the worldly good roots of practitioners of the three vehicles;

['ZH_T38_1777_002:0530a07_3']	次明順道法愛不生者，三乘之人，若入性地，發善有漏五陰，所有善法、功德、智慧順道，若生法愛，即便頂墮，不得進入忍法、成世第一法，發真無滿也；	次明順道法愛不生者，三乘之人，若入性地，發善有漏五陰，所有善法、功德、智慧順道，若生法愛，即便頂墮，不得進入忍法、成世第一法，發真無滿也；	Next, clarifying the non-arising of love for the Dharma that accords with the path: practitioners of the three vehicles, if they enter the stage of nature and give rise to the five aggregates of good and contaminated [dharmas], all good dharmas, merits, and wisdom that accord with the path, if love for the Dharma arises, then one will fall from the peak and not be able to enter the Dharma of patience and accomplish the supreme worldly dharmas, and give rise to true and complete [enlightenment].
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0530a09_19']	若能不生法愛，即不頂墮，得入忍法位，成世第一法，發真無漏，即是三乘之人同見第一義諦，斷界內見思煩惱，出三界火宅。	若能不生法愛，即不頂墮，得入忍法位，成世第一法，發真無漏，即是三乘之人同見第一義諦，斷界內見思煩惱，出三界火宅。	If one can avoid giving rise to attachment to dharmas, one will not fall into the peak, enter the stage of forbearance, accomplish the supreme worldly dharmas, and give rise to true undefiled [wisdom]. This is when the people of the three vehicles equally see the ultimate truth, sever the afflictions of views and thoughts within the realms, and leave the burning house of the three realms.
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0530a11_9']	是為此乘從三界出，到有餘涅槃，住盡智、無生智，運入無餘涅槃。	是為此乘從三界出，到有餘涅槃，住盡智、無生智，運入無餘涅槃。	This is how this vehicle leaves the three realms, reaches the nirvana with remainder, abides in the knowledge of exhaustion and non-arising, and enters the nirvana without remainder.
['ZH_T38_1777_002:0530a12_3']	故「以十法成三乘」者，其義顯也。	故「以十法成三乘」者，其義顯也。	Therefore, the meaning of using ten dharmas to accomplish the three vehicles is evident.
