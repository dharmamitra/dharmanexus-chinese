['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c08_4']	三界者，唯以言名為體，由強分別，非實有法，故不得真。	三界者，唯以言名為體，由強分別，非實有法，故不得真。	The three realms are only taken as names and terms as their essence. Due to strong discrimination, they are not real dharmas, so they cannot be truly attained.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c09_6']	由簡擇門諸法自性，為生不顛倒智，故立此論。	由簡擇門諸法自性，為生不顛倒智，故立此論。	In order to give rise to non-inverted cognition through the gate of discernment, this treatise is established.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c10_13']	於藤起蛇知，　　見藤則無境。	於藤起蛇知，　　見藤則無境。	When the knowledge of a snake arises from a vine, seeing the vine there is no object.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c12_18']	昏昧時中在非遠處，於藤色形見似蛇相，為境所誑，未見差別，謂彼是蛇，生決定解。	昏昧時中在非遠處，於藤色形見似蛇相，為境所誑，未見差別，謂彼是蛇，生決定解。	In a state of confusion, in a place not far away, seeing the form and color of the vine resembling the appearance of a snake, deceived by the object, not yet seeing the distinction, thinking that it is a snake, giving rise to a definitive understanding.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c14_5']	若見藤異相，不如分別故、虛妄生故，昔解但是亂，知則無有境。	若見藤異相，不如分別故、虛妄生故，昔解但是亂，知則無有境。	If one sees the different characteristics of the vine, because it is not as discriminated and arises falsely, the former understanding is merely confused. Knowledge then has no object.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c15_13']	若見藤分已，　　藤知如蛇知。	若見藤分已，　　藤知如蛇知。	If one sees the parts of the vine, the knowledge of the vine is like the knowledge of the snake.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c16_15']	若分分思量析此藤境，藤體不可得。	若分分思量析此藤境，藤體不可得。	If one analyzes this vine object part by part, the essence of the vine cannot be found.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c17_11']	若無體，此藤知如蛇知，但是亂知。	若無體，此藤知如蛇知，但是亂知。	If it has no substance, this knowledge of a vine is like the knowledge of a snake, it is just deluded knowledge.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c19_5']	於藤諸分中亦如是思量分析，體相不可得故，此知緣藤及藤分悉是亂知。	於藤諸分中亦如是思量分析，體相不可得故，此知緣藤及藤分悉是亂知。	In the same way, when examining and analyzing the parts of a vine, the substance and characteristics cannot be obtained, so this knowledge of a vine and its parts is all deluded knowledge.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c20_0']	一切假名類，　　簡擇自性時，	一切假名類，　　簡擇自性時，	When discerning the intrinsic nature of all nominal categories,
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c21_13']	假名從他起，　　乃至俗知境。	假名從他起，　　乃至俗知境。	The nominal arises from others, up to the realm of conventional knowledge.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c23_17']	依分分析觀察藤等不見自體，故如蛇知，此藤等知但是亂知，實無有境，一切假名。	依分分析觀察藤等不見自體，故如蛇知，此藤等知但是亂知，實無有境，一切假名。	Analyzing and observing the parts of a vine, etc., one does not see its own substance, so the knowledge of a vine, etc., is just deluded knowledge. There is no real object, all are nominal.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c26_7']	有法瓶衣人等，若觀瓦等諸分，乃至俗智境在及最後分，此中瓶等假名從他而起，最後無分析難顯離皆無。	有法瓶衣人等，若觀瓦等諸分，乃至俗智境在及最後分，此中瓶等假名從他而起，最後無分析難顯離皆無。	There are dharmas such as pots, clothes, and people. If one observes the parts such as shards, up to the realm of conventional knowledge, and the final part, the nominal such as pots, etc., arises from others. The difficulty of analyzing the final part and being apart from it is not evident.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c27_6']	一切假名類，最後分無分析，唯一隣虛。	一切假名類，最後分無分析，唯一隣虛。	In all nominal categories, the final part is without analysis, only a single atom.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c28_12']	若離一大，餘大及一大並不可顯現，無有體故，如兔角等。	若離一大，餘大及一大並不可顯現，無有體故，如兔角等。	If one of the four great elements is absent, the remaining great elements and the one great element that is absent cannot manifest, because they have no substance, like the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0883c28_17']	其異云何？	其異云何？	What is the difference between them?
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a01_1']	隣虛者不可立為一物，若有物必有方異，猶如瓶等。	隣虛者不可立為一物，若有物必有方異，猶如瓶等。	An atom cannot be established as a single entity. If there is an entity, it must have spatial distinctions, just like a vase, etc.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a02_4']	瓶等諸物是世間有，有六方異，是故有分不成一物。	瓶等諸物是世間有，有六方異，是故有分不成一物。	Vases and other objects exist in the world and have six spatial distinctions. Therefore, they have parts and are not single entities.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a03_6']	若隣虛是有，應有六方，則是有分，不成一物。	若隣虛是有，應有六方，則是有分，不成一物。	If atoms exist, they must have six spatial directions and thus have parts. They cannot be single entities.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a04_8']	若不成一物，則為多物所成，與瓶不異，亦無實體。	若不成一物，則為多物所成，與瓶不異，亦無實體。	If they cannot be single entities, then they are composed of many entities and are no different from vases. They also have no real substance.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a05_13']	智人於俗境，　　勿起真實意。	智人於俗境，　　勿起真實意。	The wise should not give rise to the idea of reality regarding conventional objects.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a07_4']	由此三界唯有散亂，若智人欲求解脫，不應起真實計。	由此三界唯有散亂，若智人欲求解脫，不應起真實計。	For this reason, the three realms only have distraction. If the wise wish to seek liberation, they should not give rise to real conceptualization.

['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a07_11']	有亂識。	有亂識。	There is deluded consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a07_13']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a09_1']	若汝言「我信瓶等外物自性不可得故，但有分別亂識緣無境起。	若汝言「我信瓶等外物自性不可得故，但有分別亂識緣無境起。	If you say that you believe that the self-nature of external things like pots cannot be obtained, so there is only a discriminating deluded consciousness that arises without an object,
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a09_5']	何以故？	何以故？	why is it so?
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a10_7']	幻化人、乾闥婆城等實非有，亂識似幻等起而非無。	幻化人、乾闥婆城等實非有，亂識似幻等起而非無。	Because illusory people, gandharva cities, etc. are actually non-existent, but the deluded consciousness arises like an illusion, etc., it is not non-existent.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a10_19']	」是義不然，以不成就故。	」是義不然，以不成就故。	This meaning is not so, because it is not accomplished.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a11_4']	云何不成就？	云何不成就？	How is it not accomplished?
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a11_13']	如所見不如是有故。	如所見不如是有故。	Because it is not as it is seen.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a12_12']	此亂識似無物，由物無體，云何識得有？	此亂識似無物，由物無體，云何識得有？	This deluded consciousness is like a non-existent thing, because the substance of the thing does not exist, how can the consciousness be said to exist?
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a13_6']	如所緣塵自性，能緣自性亦如是。	如所緣塵自性，能緣自性亦如是。	As is the self-nature of the object of perception, so is the self-nature of the perceiver.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a14_1']	所緣塵既無，此亂識不能自起。	所緣塵既無，此亂識不能自起。	Since the object of perception does not exist, this deluded consciousness cannot arise by itself.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a14_16']	由他功力，他既不成，起義何在？	由他功力，他既不成，起義何在？	By the power of another, since the other is not accomplished, what is the meaning of arising?
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a15_11']	以是義故，亂識有義，云何得立？	以是義故，亂識有義，云何得立？	For this reason, how can the meaning of deluded consciousness be established?
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a16_19']	於世間無如此法種子等生因，若無所生芽等果是有，則無是處。	於世間無如此法種子等生因，若無所生芽等果是有，則無是處。	In the world, there is no such kind of seed, etc., as the cause of arising. If the sprout, etc., which is to be produced, exists without a cause, then there is no such possibility.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a17_11']	是故說幻化等譬亦不可立。	是故說幻化等譬亦不可立。	Therefore, the similes of illusion and transformation, etc., are also not established.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a18_0']	一切假名物，　　若細心思量，	一切假名物，　　若細心思量，	All nominally existent things, if carefully contemplated,
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a19_13']	智人欲等惑，　　能除如蛇怖。	智人欲等惑，　　能除如蛇怖。	The wise can eliminate desires and other delusions, just as they would fear of a snake.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a21_3']	猶如是說已識三界但假名，除瓶等麁識，習微細心。	猶如是說已識三界但假名，除瓶等麁識，習微細心。	Thus it is said that the three realms are merely nominally existent. Except for the coarse cognition of pots, etc., one should cultivate subtle contemplation.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a22_7']	如世間所立瓶衣等物由假名有，約世俗心不違此事。	如世間所立瓶衣等物由假名有，約世俗心不違此事。	Just as pots, clothes, and other things established in the world exist nominally, this does not contradict the conventional mind.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a23_13']	後為遣此俗心，方起簡擇心，但見唯有亂識、無有外塵。	後為遣此俗心，方起簡擇心，但見唯有亂識、無有外塵。	Later, in order to eliminate this conventional mind, one should arouse the mind of discernment and only see that there is only deluded cognition and no external objects.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a24_13']	此亂識因不成就故、似無物故，體則不成就。	此亂識因不成就故、似無物故，體則不成就。	Because the cause of this deluded cognition is not established and it resembles non-existence, its essence is not established.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a25_4']	內外既無所有，得會法空。	內外既無所有，得會法空。	Since both internal and external do not exist, one can realize the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a26_1']	一切分別所作、欲等諸惑，智人易除。	一切分別所作、欲等諸惑，智人易除。	All the delusions created by discrimination, such as desires, are easy for the wise to eliminate.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a27_9']	譬如於藤妄起蛇想而生怖畏，若見差別，定知是藤，能除蛇怖。	譬如於藤妄起蛇想而生怖畏，若見差別，定知是藤，能除蛇怖。	It is like mistakenly giving rise to the thought of a snake on a rattan vine and becoming frightened. If one sees the difference and definitely knows it is a rattan vine, one can eliminate the fear of a snake.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a28_15']	由思量能起欲等諸塵自性速易能滅，欲等惑妄亦復如是。	由思量能起欲等諸塵自性速易能滅，欲等惑妄亦復如是。	Because by thinking and pondering, desire and other defilements can arise. The nature of objects is quickly and easily extinguished, and desire and other delusions are also like this.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884a29_0']	智人不違世，　　隨說世間法，	智人不違世，　　隨說世間法，	The wise do not go against the world, but follow the worldly dharmas in speaking.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884b01_13']	若欲滅惑障，　　依真應觀察。	若欲滅惑障，　　依真應觀察。	If one wishes to extinguish the obstacles of delusion, one should observe in accordance with the truth.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884b02_17']	如世間瓶衣等物，信有不違，或說示他。	如世間瓶衣等物，信有不違，或說示他。	Just as in the world, one believes in the existence of things like pots and clothes, and does not go against them, or shows them to others.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884b04_4']	如此智人先隨此事，後若求解脫，應修真理，簡擇世法自性。	如此智人先隨此事，後若求解脫，應修真理，簡擇世法自性。	In this way, the wise person first follows these things, but later, if wishing for liberation, should cultivate the true principle and discern the nature of worldly dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1620_001:0884b05_1']	若如理簡擇，現起惑滅、未起不生。	若如理簡擇，現起惑滅、未起不生。	If one discerns in accordance with principle, the arising delusions are extinguished, and those not yet arisen do not arise.
