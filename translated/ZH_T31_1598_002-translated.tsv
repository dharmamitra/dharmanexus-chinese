In certain places, in the realms, at certain times, in the formless realm, form is interrupted, and in the heaven of non-perception and the two meditative absorptions, mind is interrupted.

The power of the eighth consciousness is able to initiate all of these.

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a21_8']	謂內外等稻穀麥等名外種子，阿賴耶識名內種子。	謂內外等稻穀麥等名外種子，阿賴耶識名內種子。	That is, external seeds such as rice, wheat, etc. are called external seeds. The ālaya consciousness is called internal seeds.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a21_18']	不明了者，是無記故。	不明了者，是無記故。	Unclear means indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a22_13']	言二種者，謂外及內，或果與因。	言二種者，謂外及內，或果與因。	The two kinds of seeds are external and internal, or fruit and cause.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a23_11']	此俱唯識，由持因性，雜染清淨二法轉故。	此俱唯識，由持因性，雜染清淨二法轉故。	These are all consciousness only, because the two kinds of dharmas, defiled and pure, evolve by the power of the seeds.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a25_7']	有本頌言於二者，彼應於因於果執麥等外種說名世俗，阿賴耶識所變現故。	有本頌言於二者，彼應於因於果執麥等外種說名世俗，阿賴耶識所變現故。	The two in the verse refer to cause and fruit. The seeds of wheat, etc., are called conventional seeds because they are transformations of the seeds of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a26_19']	言勝義者，阿賴耶識是實種子，是一切種子實因緣性故，及為彼體故。	言勝義者，阿賴耶識是實種子，是一切種子實因緣性故，及為彼體故。	The seeds of the ālaya consciousness are called real seeds because they are the real cause of all seeds.

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a28_7']	剎那滅者，生已無間即滅壞故。	剎那滅者，生已無間即滅壞故。	They are momentary, because they perish immediately after they are born.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a29_6']	無有常住得成種子，於一切時無差別故。	無有常住得成種子，於一切時無差別故。	They cannot be permanent and still be seeds, because they would not differ at any time.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389a29_16']	雖剎那滅，然非已滅。	雖剎那滅，然非已滅。	Although momentary, they do not perish by themselves.

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b01_16']	已滅生果，不應理故，如死雞鳴。	已滅生果，不應理故，如死雞鳴。	It would be illogical for something that has perished to produce a result, just as a dead person cannot speak.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b03_4']	是故應許種子與果俱時而住，以此與果不相違故，如蓮華根。	是故應許種子與果俱時而住，以此與果不相違故，如蓮華根。	Therefore, it must be admitted that seeds and fruits coexist, because this does not contradict the production of fruits, just as the roots of a lotus flower do.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b04_3']	雖復俱有，然非一二三剎那住，猶如電光。	雖復俱有，然非一二三剎那住，猶如電光。	Although they coexist, they do not remain for one, two, or three moments, just like a flash of lightning.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b04_6']	何者？	何者？	What is that?
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b05_7']	應知此恒隨轉、剎那轉轉，經於多時恒隨轉故。	應知此恒隨轉、剎那轉轉，經於多時恒隨轉故。	It should be known that this is always evolving and changing from moment to moment, because it evolves and changes for a long time.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b05_12']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b06_2']	其根損益，枝等同故。	其根損益，枝等同故。	Because when the roots are damaged or benefited, the branches and so forth are the same.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b07_9']	若恒隨轉，非許少分樂為種子，何因緣故不從一切一切俱生？	若恒隨轉，非許少分樂為種子，何因緣故不從一切一切俱生？	If it always evolves, and if it is not admitted that a small part is the seed, why do not all things arise from all things at the same time?
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b07_19']	為避此難，故說決定。	為避此難，故說決定。	In order to avoid this difficulty, it is said that there is a definite relation between seeds and fruits.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b09_3']	雖恒隨轉，以諸種子功能定故，不從一切一切俱生。	雖恒隨轉，以諸種子功能定故，不從一切一切俱生。	Even though they always evolve, because the power of the seeds is definite, all things do not arise from all things at the same time.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b09_17']	雖爾，何故不一切時常能生果？	雖爾，何故不一切時常能生果？	Even so, why do they not always produce fruits?
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b10_7']	為避此失，言待眾緣。	為避此失，言待眾緣。	In order to avoid this difficulty, it is said that they depend on a collection of conditions.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b11_1']	非一切時會遇眾緣，故無過失。	非一切時會遇眾緣，故無過失。	It is not the case that they always encounter a collection of conditions, so there is no error.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b11_10']	今此種子是誰種子？	今此種子是誰種子？	Now, whose seeds are these seeds?

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b13_13']	所言唯者，若於此時能生自果，即於爾時說名種子，種與有種並無始故。	所言唯者，若於此時能生自果，即於爾時說名種子，種與有種並無始故。	The word only means that if at a certain time it can produce its own fruit, then at that time it is called a seed. Because seeds and having seeds are both beginningless.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b15_17']	由此唯言，遮相續等為種子體，如所說種子法不相應故，要待所熏能熏相應，種與有種其性方立。	由此唯言，遮相續等為種子體，如所說種子法不相應故，要待所熏能熏相應，種與有種其性方立。	By this word only, it denies that a continuum, etc. is the substance of seeds, because it is not in accord with the principle of seeds as explained. It is necessary to wait for the perfumed and the perfumer to be in accord before the nature of seeds and having seeds is established.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b16_7']	為辯所熏故說堅等。	為辯所熏故說堅等。	In order to clarify what is perfumable, it is said to be firm, etc.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b18_11']	若法相續隨轉堅住，如苣勝等乃為所熏非不堅住，猶如聲等，非唯堅住，復無記性，方是所熏。	若法相續隨轉堅住，如苣勝等乃為所熏非不堅住，猶如聲等，非唯堅住，復無記性，方是所熏。	If a dharma continues in a series and evolves stably, like sesame, etc., then it is perfumable. If it is not stable, like sound, etc., it is not perfumable. Not only must it be stable, it must also be indeterminate in nature in order to be perfumable.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b19_8']	如平等香乃受熏習，非極香物如沈麝等；	如平等香乃受熏習，非極香物如沈麝等；	Like an equal-flavored fragrance, it receives perfuming. An extremely fragrant substance, like frankincense, etc.,

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b21_7']	言可熏者，若物可熏或能受熏，分分展轉更相和糅，乃名可熏。	言可熏者，若物可熏或能受熏，分分展轉更相和糅，乃名可熏。	That which is perfumable is a substance that can be perfumed or that can receive perfuming, and that is perfumable when its parts are gradually transformed and mixed with the perfuming.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b22_5', 'ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b23_9']	非金石等能受熏習，不可分分相和糅故。🔽非唯可熏，要復與彼能熏相應，乃名所熏，非別異住。	非金石等能受熏習，不可分分相和糅故。 非唯可熏，要復與彼能熏相應，乃名所熏，非別異住。	Gold, stone, etc., cannot receive perfuming because their parts cannot be gradually transformed and mixed.🔽Not only must a dharma be perfumable, it must also be associated with the perfumer in order to be perfumable. It does not exist separately.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b24_17']	同時同處不即不離名曰相應，具斯眾德可名所熏，非異於此。	同時同處不即不離名曰相應，具斯眾德可名所熏，非異於此。	Simultaneous presence in the same place, neither identical nor different, is called association. Endowed with these many virtues, it is called perfumable, and it is not different from this.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b25_10']	非聲為遮一切轉識是所熏性。	非聲為遮一切轉識是所熏性。	This does not mean that sound is excluded from being the perfumable nature of all evolving consciousnesses,
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b26_1']	如上所說義相違故。	如上所說義相違故。	because it contradicts the above explanations.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b28_17']	阿賴耶識其體堅住，乃至治生相續隨轉未曾斷故，性唯無記非善惡故，性應可熏或能受熏，非常住故、能熏相應俱生滅故。	阿賴耶識其體堅住，乃至治生相續隨轉未曾斷故，性唯無記非善惡故，性應可熏或能受熏，非常住故、能熏相應俱生滅故。	The substance of the ālaya consciousness is firm and enduring, and until the antidote arises, it continues in a series and is never cut off. Its nature is only indeterminate, not good or bad. It must be perfumable or able to receive perfuming, because it is not permanent and is born together with and perishes together with the perfumer.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389b29_3']	是為熏習。	是為熏習。	This is perfuming.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c01_2']	相者，是彼法故，所熏為能相、熏習為所相。	相者，是彼法故，所熏為能相、熏習為所相。	The characteristic is that of being the dharma, and the perfumed is the characteristic as subject and the perfuming is the characteristic as object.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c02_1']	又諸轉識定非所熏，以彼六識無定相應。	又諸轉識定非所熏，以彼六識無定相應。	Also, the evolving consciousnesses are definitely not perfumed, because those six consciousnesses are not definitely associated.

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c02_14']	以三差別互相違故。	以三差別互相違故。	Because the three kinds of discrimination are mutually contradictory.

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c04_12']	以各別故，六種轉識不定俱生。	以各別故，六種轉識不定俱生。	Because they are different, the six evolving consciousnesses are not born together.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c05_3']	不俱生故，無定相應。	不俱生故，無定相應。	Because they are not born together, they are not definitely associated.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c05_17']	無相應故，何有所熏能熏之性？	無相應故，何有所熏能熏之性？	If there is no association, how can there be a perfumable and a perfume?
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c07_5']	若言前念熏於後念成熏習者，此義不然，以其二念不俱有故。	若言前念熏於後念成熏習者，此義不然，以其二念不俱有故。	If it is said that the former moment perfumes the later moment and perfuming is established, that is not so, because the two moments do not exist together.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c08_4']	此亦顯示由二剎那不俱有故，無定相應。	此亦顯示由二剎那不俱有故，無定相應。	This also shows that because of the nonexistence of the two moments, there is no definite association.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c08_18']	無相應故，無有所熏能熏之性。	無相應故，無有所熏能熏之性。	Because there is no association, there is no perfumable and a perfume.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c10_12']	若言依止種類句義，六種轉識或二剎那同一識類，或剎那類無有差別。	若言依止種類句義，六種轉識或二剎那同一識類，或剎那類無有差別。	If you say that the six evolving consciousnesses are of the same species because they are supported by the same species of manas, then the six consciousnesses of the two moments of the same species of manas would be of the same species, and there would be no difference in species between the moments.🔽

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c14_14']	或類例餘成過失者，是例餘類有過失義。	或類例餘成過失者，是例餘類有過失義。	Or, if the species is the same as the other, it is faulty.

['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c15_17']	謂眼等根清淨色性，皆根種類之所隨逐。	謂眼等根清淨色性，皆根種類之所隨逐。	The pure form of the eye and other organs is all perfumable by the species of the organs.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c16_12']	意根亦應成造色性，根義等故。	意根亦應成造色性，根義等故。	The mental organ should also be perfumable by the species of the organs, because the meaning of organ is the same.
['ZH_T31_1598_002:0389c18_19']	且有爾所熏習異計，或說六識展轉相熏、或說前念熏於後念、或說熏識剎那種類，如是一切皆不應理。	且有爾所熏習異計，或說六識展轉相熏、或說前念熏於後念、或說熏識剎那種類，如是一切皆不應理。	There are many other theories of perfuming, such as the six consciousnesses perfuming each other, a prior moment perfuming a subsequent moment, or the species of moments of consciousness perfuming each other. All of these are unreasonable.

If external seeds are the direct cause of birth for sprouts, they are the cause of attraction for stems, etc.
