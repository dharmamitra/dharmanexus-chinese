In the previous chapter it was said that just as the agent and action are mutually inseparable in their designation of existence, the two dharmas of grasper and grasped are also mutually inseparable in their designation of existence, not in ultimate truth.

['ZH_T30_1567_008:0154b03_4']	彼宗引云：	彼宗引云：	008	They cite the following:
['ZH_T30_1567_008:0154b03_15']	如佛所言，名色緣六處。	如佛所言，名色緣六處。	008	As the Buddha said, name-and-form conditions the six sense bases.
['ZH_T30_1567_008:0154b06_1']	而彼色者四大所成，即有能取所取，是故實有取者分位，由眼等根與六處和合次第，乃有受法生起。	而彼色者四大所成，即有能取所取，是故實有取者分位，由眼等根與六處和合次第，乃有受法生起。	008	But that form is composed of the four great elements, so there is both that which can grasp and that which is grasped. Therefore, there is a real state of the grasper, and due to the eyes and other faculties combining with the six sense bases in sequence, the dharma of experience arises and occurs.

['ZH_T30_1567_008:0154b12_2']	若爾即非所取，以能取非所取成故。	若爾即非所取，以能取非所取成故。	008	If so, then it is not the grasped, because the grasper is not formed by the grasped.
['ZH_T30_1567_008:0154b15_12']	若所取如是決定有彼所取性者，如秤低昂，即因果生滅離所取法，彼同時性如是決定，能取差別即有多性可得，非無差別一性同生，以離所取有所成故。	若所取如是決定有彼所取性者，如秤低昂，即因果生滅離所取法，彼同時性如是決定，能取差別即有多性可得，非無差別一性同生，以離所取有所成故。	008	If the grasped is thus determined to have the nature of the grasped, then like a scale's balance, the arising and ceasing of cause and effect are apart from the grasped phenomena. Their simultaneous nature is thus determined, and the distinctions of the grasper can be obtained as having many natures, not without distinctions as a single nature arising together, because apart from the grasped there is that which is formed.
['ZH_T30_1567_008:0154b16_8']	若或大種所取隨生，即無法先住。	若或大種所取隨生，即無法先住。	008	If it is that the grasped arises following the great elements, then there is no dharma that abides prior.

['ZH_T30_1567_008:0154b18_9']	亦非能取所取中間決定有法可得。	亦非能取所取中間決定有法可得。	008	It is also not that between the grasper and the grasped there is a dharma that can be obtained as determined.
