['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c02_11']	復次云何得知依他性為分別性相顯現而住，然非分別性體也？	復次云何得知依他性為分別性相顯現而住，然非分別性體也？	Next, how can it be known that the dependent nature appears as the characteristics of the discriminated nature and abides, but is not the substance of the discriminated nature?
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c03_3']	於名前無智，即體相違故；	於名前無智，即體相違故；	Because there is no cognition before the name, it contradicts the substance;
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c03_14']	多名有多體，此相違故；	多名有多體，此相違故；	Because there are many names with many substances, it contradicts this;
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c04_3']	名不定，雜體相違故。	名不定，雜體相違故。	Because the name is indefinite, it contradicts the mixed substance.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c04_8']	此中有偈：	此中有偈：	There is a verse on this:
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c05_0']	於名前無智，　　多名及不定，	於名前無智，　　多名及不定，	There is no cognition before the name, many names and indefiniteness,
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c06_13']	同及多雜體，　　成就此相違。	同及多雜體，　　成就此相違。	The same and many mixed substances, accomplishing this contradiction.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c07_0']	法無而可見，　　無染而有淨，	法無而可見，　　無染而有淨，	Dharmas are nonexistent yet can be seen, unstained yet have purity,
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c08_13']	應知如幻事，　　亦復似虛空。	應知如幻事，　　亦復似虛空。	One should know they are like magical creations, and also resemble space.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c09_2']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c10_13']	如依他性中雖分別一分可見，然不成彼性，顯示此故，於名前無智。	如依他性中雖分別一分可見，然不成彼性，顯示此故，於名前無智。	Although a part of the dependent nature can be seen as conceptualization, it does not constitute that nature. To illustrate this, it says that there is no cognition prior to names.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c11_18']	同體相違故者，若分別與依他是一體，則離名於義中智生。	同體相違故者，若分別與依他是一體，則離名於義中智生。	As for the reason of contradiction in the same nature, if conceptualization and the dependent nature are of the same nature, then cognition would arise regarding an object apart from its name.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c12_14']	如瓶離瓶名，於瓶義中瓶智不生。	如瓶離瓶名，於瓶義中瓶智不生。	Just as apart from the name pot, the cognition of the object pot would not arise.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c13_12']	若瓶名與瓶義是一相者，則應智自生。	若瓶名與瓶義是一相者，則應智自生。	If the name pot and the object pot were of the same nature, then cognition would arise by itself.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c14_10']	以不一相故，若言名義同體，即是相違。	以不一相故，若言名義同體，即是相違。	Because they are not of the same nature, if it is said that name and object are of the same nature, this is contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c15_4']	此中成立名是依他，義是分別。	此中成立名是依他，義是分別。	Here it is established that the name is dependent and the object is conceptualized.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c15_8']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c16_1']	此依他由名力故成所分別。	此依他由名力故成所分別。	This dependent nature becomes what is conceptualized by the power of the name.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c17_7']	又一義有多名，若名義是一相，如名有眾多，義亦應眾多。	又一義有多名，若名義是一相，如名有眾多，義亦應眾多。	Moreover, if the name and object were of the same nature, then just as the name has many, the object would also have many.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c17_18']	若爾，此義則應有多體。	若爾，此義則應有多體。	If so, then this object would have many natures.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c18_10']	此一義有多體，即是相違。	此一義有多體，即是相違。	This one object having many natures is contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c19_4']	是故兩性一體，即是第二相違。	是故兩性一體，即是第二相違。	Therefore, the two natures being one substance is the second contradiction.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c20_18']	又名不定，如瞿名能目九義，若執名義是一，即諸義同體，此執是第三相違。	又名不定，如瞿名能目九義，若執名義是一，即諸義同體，此執是第三相違。	Moreover, names are indefinite. For example, the word cow can refer to nine meanings. If one grasps that names and meanings are the same, then all meanings would have the same substance. This grasping is the third contradiction.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c22_1']	以無量別相義皆成牛等一體故，偈中亦說此義。	以無量別相義皆成牛等一體故，偈中亦說此義。	Because innumerable distinct meanings would all become the same substance as a cow, etc. The verse also explains this meaning.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c23_3']	於偈中言成就者，明依他與分別不同體義成就。	於偈中言成就者，明依他與分別不同體義成就。	In the verse, accomplished clarifies that the dependent nature and discrimination are not of the same substance.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c24_5']	法無而可見等，此一偈為教諸弟子幻等譬喻故。	法無而可見等，此一偈為教諸弟子幻等譬喻故。	Dharmas are non-existent yet can be seen, etc. This one verse is for teaching disciples through the analogy of illusions, etc.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c25_13']	弟子有二種相違疑難，法無而可見、無染而有淨，於此有疑。	弟子有二種相違疑難，法無而可見、無染而有淨，於此有疑。	Disciples have two kinds of contradictory doubts and difficulties: dharmas are non-existent yet can be seen, and are unstained yet have purity. There is doubt about this.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c26_9']	於中如幻事者，如幻象實不有而可見。	於中如幻事者，如幻象實不有而可見。	Among them, like an illusion means that an illusory elephant is actually non-existent yet can be seen.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c27_4']	義亦如是，雖不有而亦可見。	義亦如是，雖不有而亦可見。	The meaning is also like this. Although non-existent, it can still be seen.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0289c28_11']	又如虛空雲等，不能染污本性清淨，然雲等除時名為清淨。	又如虛空雲等，不能染污本性清淨，然雲等除時名為清淨。	Moreover, it is like space, which cannot be defiled by clouds and so forth, and is said to be pure when the clouds and so forth are removed.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a01_1']	諸法亦爾，無有染污本性清淨，然除客塵障垢時名為清淨應知。	諸法亦爾，無有染污本性清淨，然除客塵障垢時名為清淨應知。	The dharmas are also like this, not defiled by the originally pure nature, and when the adventitious dust and dirt are removed, it is said to be pure. This should be understood.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a02_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a03_3']	復次如所顯現既不有，此依他性一切種悉無。	復次如所顯現既不有，此依他性一切種悉無。	Next, since what appears does not exist, all aspects of this dependent nature are non-existent.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a04_4']	何故不成若無依他成就性亦無，一切無所有？	何故不成若無依他成就性亦無，一切無所有？	Why does it not become non-existent if the dependent nature is established and the perfected nature also does not exist, with everything being non-existent?
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a04_9']	此義不成。	此義不成。	This meaning is not established.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a05_10']	若依他性及成就性俱無，則無染污及清淨過。	若依他性及成就性俱無，則無染污及清淨過。	If the dependent nature and the perfected nature are both non-existent, then there would be the error of defilement and purity not existing.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a06_5']	現見染污及清淨，是故非一切無。	現見染污及清淨，是故非一切無。	Defilement and purity are presently seen, therefore not everything is non-existent.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a06_10']	此中有偈：	此中有偈：	Here there is a verse:
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a07_0']	若無依他性，　　成就性亦無，	若無依他性，　　成就性亦無，	If the dependent nature does not exist, the perfected nature also does not exist,
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a08_13']	則亦恒不有，　　染污及清淨。	則亦恒不有，　　染污及清淨。	Then defilement and purity would always not exist.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a09_2']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary states:
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a09_14']	依他性如所顯現不如是有。	依他性如所顯現不如是有。	The dependent nature is not as it appears.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a11_2']	今為顯一切種悉無不成故，說此依他若不有，成就亦不有。	今為顯一切種悉無不成故，說此依他若不有，成就亦不有。	Now, in order to show that all kinds are not unaccomplished, it is said that if the dependent nature does not exist, the perfected nature also does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a11_6']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a12_9']	由有染故則有淨，是故若二種俱無，即一切悉無。	由有染故則有淨，是故若二種俱無，即一切悉無。	Because there is defilement, there is purification. Therefore, if the two are both non-existent, then everything is non-existent.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a12_19']	此義不成，今當顯示。	此義不成，今當顯示。	This meaning is not established, and now it will be revealed.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a13_8']	謗無染淨，此是過失。	謗無染淨，此是過失。	Slandering the non-existence of defilement and purity is a fault.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a13_12']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a14_1']	現見有染有淨故。	現見有染有淨故。	Because defilement and purity are presently seen to exist.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a15_9']	此依他、成就二法現見是有，若執言無，則是實有染淨而謗言無。	此依他、成就二法現見是有，若執言無，則是實有染淨而謗言無。	The two dharmas of the dependent and the perfected are presently seen to exist. If one grasps and says they do not exist, then this is truly having defilement and purity and slandering them as non-existent.

['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290a20_2']	若說四種清淨法應知。	若說四種清淨法應知。	If one explains the four kinds of pure dharmas, one should understand.

['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290b04_8']	由有此故，說一切法為如來藏。	由有此故，說一切法為如來藏。	Because of having this, it is said that all dharmas are the tathāgatagarbha.

Because of the purity of this thusness, it can be called the Buddha.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290b07_12']	至得道清淨者，得彼之道亦是清淨，即是菩提分、念處等波羅蜜故。	至得道清淨者，得彼之道亦是清淨，即是菩提分、念處等波羅蜜故。	The purity of attaining the path is the purity of attaining that path, which is precisely the factors of enlightenment, the foundations of mindfulness, and the perfections.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290b10_3']	道生境界清淨者，是諸菩提分法勝得生緣，此生緣亦是清淨，故說道生境界清淨，即是修多羅等十二部言教。	道生境界清淨者，是諸菩提分法勝得生緣，此生緣亦是清淨，故說道生境界清淨，即是修多羅等十二部言教。	The purity of the realm of the arising of the path is the condition for the arising of the superior attainment of the factors of enlightenment. This arising condition is also pure, therefore it is called the purity of the realm of the arising of the path. It is precisely the twelve divisions of the teachings such as the sūtras.
['ZH_T31_1596_005:0290b10_17']	此言教若是分別，即成染污因；	此言教若是分別，即成染污因；	If this teaching is discrimination, it becomes a defiled cause;
