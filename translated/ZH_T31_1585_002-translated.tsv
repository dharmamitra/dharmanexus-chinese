['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c21_16']	復如何知諸有為相異色心等有實自性？	復如何知諸有為相異色心等有實自性？	002	How do we know that the characteristics of conditioned phenomena are different from form, mind, etc., and have their own real nature?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c22_4']	契經說故。	契經說故。	002	Because it is said in the scriptures.

['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c23_4']	有三有為之有為相，乃至廣說。	有三有為之有為相，乃至廣說。	002	There are three characteristics of conditioned phenomena, and so on, in detail.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c24_4']	此經不說異色心等有實自性，為證不成。	此經不說異色心等有實自性，為證不成。	002	This sūtra does not say that there is a real nature different from form, mind, etc., so your proof is not established.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c25_4']	非第六聲便表異體，色心之體即色心故。	非第六聲便表異體，色心之體即色心故。	002	The sixth sound does not necessarily indicate a different substance, because the substance of form and mind is just form and mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c26_4']	非能相體定異所相，勿堅相等異地等故。	非能相體定異所相，勿堅相等異地等故。	002	The substance of the characteristics is not necessarily different from the characterized, because the characteristics of solidity, etc., are not different from earth, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c27_4']	若有為相異所相體，無為相體應異所相。	若有為相異所相體，無為相體應異所相。	002	If the characteristics of conditioned phenomena are different from the substance of the characterized, then the substance of the characteristics of unconditioned phenomena should be different from the characterized.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c28_3']	又生等相若體俱有，應一切時齊興作用。	又生等相若體俱有，應一切時齊興作用。	002	Moreover, if the characteristics such as arising exist simultaneously with the substance, then they should all function at the same time.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0005c29_3']	若相違故用不頓興，體亦相違，如何俱有？	若相違故用不頓興，體亦相違，如何俱有？	002	If they do not function all at once because they are mutually contradictory, then how can they exist simultaneously if their substances are mutually contradictory?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a01_2']	又住異滅用不應俱，能相所相體俱本有；	又住異滅用不應俱，能相所相體俱本有；	002	Also, the functions of abiding and cessation cannot occur simultaneously, because the substance of that which has a characteristic and that which possesses a characteristic are both originally existent.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a01_12']	用亦應然，無別性故。	用亦應然，無別性故。	002	The functions of these two must also be so, because they have no separate natures.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a02_11']	若謂彼用更待因緣，所待因緣應非本有。	若謂彼用更待因緣，所待因緣應非本有。	002	If it is said that these two functions must await causes and conditions, then the causes and conditions that are awaited cannot be originally existent.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a03_11']	又執生等便為無用，所相恒有而生等合；	又執生等便為無用，所相恒有而生等合；	002	Also, if it is held that arising, etc., are useless, and that that which has characteristics always exists and is united with arising, etc.,
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a04_10']	應無為法亦有生等，彼此異因不可得故。	應無為法亦有生等，彼此異因不可得故。	002	then dharmas that are unconditioned must also have arising, etc., because the reason for the difference between these two cannot be found.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a05_10']	又去來世非現非常，應似空花非實有性。	又去來世非現非常，應似空花非實有性。	002	Also, the future and past are not present and not permanent, and must be like a flower in the sky and not really existent.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a06_2']	生名為有，寧在未來？	生名為有，寧在未來？	002	Arising is called existence. How can it be in the future?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a06_12']	滅名為無，應非現在。	滅名為無，應非現在。	002	Cessation is called nonexistence. It must not be present.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a07_2']	滅若非無，生應非有。	滅若非無，生應非有。	002	If cessation is not nonexistence, then arising must be existence.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a07_12']	又滅違住，寧執同時？	又滅違住，寧執同時？	002	Also, if cessation is contrary to abiding, how can it be held that they occur simultaneously?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a08_3']	住不違生，何容異世？	住不違生，何容異世？	002	If abiding is not contrary to arising, how can they be in different times?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a08_12']	故彼所執進退非理。	故彼所執進退非理。	002	Therefore the characteristics of the conditioned are neither advanced nor reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a10_3']	然有為法因緣力故，本無今有、暫有還無，表異無為假立四相：	然有為法因緣力故，本無今有、暫有還無，表異無為假立四相：	002	However, because of the power of causes and conditions, dharmas that are conditioned do not exist previously but are now existent, are temporarily existent, and then return to nonexistence. In order to distinguish them from the unconditioned, the four characteristics of arising, etc., are conventionally established.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a10_13']	本無今有，有位名生；	本無今有，有位名生；	002	Existence in the state of having had no prior existence is called birth.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a11_2']	生位暫停，即說為住；	生位暫停，即說為住；	002	The temporary suspension of the state of existence is called duration.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a11_12']	住別前後，復立異名；	住別前後，復立異名；	002	The distinction of prior and subsequent in the state of duration is again called old age.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a12_2']	暫有還無，無時名滅。	暫有還無，無時名滅。	002	The temporary existence that returns to nonexistence is called extinction.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a13_2']	前三有故同在現在，後一是無故在過去。	前三有故同在現在，後一是無故在過去。	002	The first three exist, and therefore they are categorized as present. The last one is nonexistent, and therefore it is categorized as past.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a13_11']	如何無法與有為相？	如何無法與有為相？	002	How can something nonexistent be a characteristic of something existent?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a14_2']	表此後無，為相何失？	表此後無，為相何失？	002	What is wrong with taking the future nonexistence of something as its characteristic?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a16_14']	生表有法先非有，滅表有法後是無，異表此法非凝然，住表此法暫有用，故此四相於有為法雖俱名表而表有異。	生表有法先非有，滅表有法後是無，異表此法非凝然，住表此法暫有用，故此四相於有為法雖俱名表而表有異。	002	Birth indicates that a dharma was previously nonexistent, and extinction indicates that a dharma will be nonexistent later. Old age indicates that this dharma is not static, and duration indicates that this dharma has a temporary function. Therefore, although these four characteristics are all called indications of the conditioned, there is a difference in what they indicate.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a17_15']	此依剎那假立四相，一期分位亦得假立。	此依剎那假立四相，一期分位亦得假立。	002	These four characteristics are provisionally established on the basis of a single moment. They can also be provisionally established on the basis of a period of time in the life of a dharma.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a19_15']	初有名生，後無名滅，生已相似相續名住，即此相續轉變名異，是故四相皆是假立。	初有名生，後無名滅，生已相似相續名住，即此相續轉變名異，是故四相皆是假立。	002	The first moment is called birth, the last is called extinction, the continuity of similar moments is called duration, and the transformation of this continuity is called old age. Therefore, the four characteristics are all provisionally established.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a20_13']	復如何知異色心等有實詮表名句文身？	復如何知異色心等有實詮表名句文身？	002	How do you know that there are real name, phrase, and syllable apart from form, mind, etc.?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a21_1']	契經說故。	契經說故。	002	Because it is said in the scriptures.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a21_6']	如契經說：	如契經說：	002	A scripture says,
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a21_15']	佛得希有名句文身。	佛得希有名句文身。	002	The Buddha has obtained the marvelous names, phrases, and syllables.

['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a23_15']	若名句文異聲實有，應如色等非實能詮。	若名句文異聲實有，應如色等非實能詮。	002	If names, phrases, and syllables are really different from sound, they must be like form, etc., and not really able to express.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a25_7']	謂聲能生名句文者，此聲必有音韻屈曲，此足能詮，何用名等？	謂聲能生名句文者，此聲必有音韻屈曲，此足能詮，何用名等？	002	That is, if sound generates names, phrases, and syllables, then this sound must have a melody and a rhythm, and this is sufficient to express, so what need is there for names, etc.?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a27_5']	若謂聲上音韻屈曲即名句文，異聲實有所見色上形量屈曲，應異色處別有實體。	若謂聲上音韻屈曲即名句文，異聲實有所見色上形量屈曲，應異色處別有實體。	002	If you say that the melody and rhythm in sound are names, phrases, and syllables, and that they are different from sound and really exist, then you must admit that the shape and size of visible form are different from the visible form base and have real substance.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a28_17']	若謂聲上音韻屈曲如絃管聲非能詮者，此應如彼聲，不別生名等。	若謂聲上音韻屈曲如絃管聲非能詮者，此應如彼聲，不別生名等。	002	If you say that the melody and rhythm in sound, like the sound of a stringed instrument, are not able to express, then sound should not generate names, etc., just as the sound of a stringed instrument does not.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006a29_8']	又誰說彼定不能詮？	又誰說彼定不能詮？	002	Moreover, who says that sound is definitely unable to express?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b01_16']	聲若能詮，風鈴聲等應有詮用，此應如彼不別生實名句文身。	聲若能詮，風鈴聲等應有詮用，此應如彼不別生實名句文身。	002	If sound is able to express meaning, then the sound of wind chimes, etc., should have the function of expressing meaning, and this should be like that, not producing a real collection of names, phrases, and syllables.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b02_16']	若唯語聲能生名等，如何不許唯語能詮？	若唯語聲能生名等，如何不許唯語能詮？	002	If only the sound of speech can produce names, etc., why not allow that speech alone can express meaning?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b03_16']	何理定知能詮即語，寧知異語別有能詮？	何理定知能詮即語，寧知異語別有能詮？	002	What principle determines that that which expresses meaning is speech? How do you know that that which expresses meaning is different from speech?
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b04_19']	語不異能詮，人天共了，執能詮異語，天愛非餘。	語不異能詮，人天共了，執能詮異語，天愛非餘。	002	Speech is not different from that which expresses meaning. This is understood by both humans and gods. The attachment to the idea that that which expresses meaning is different from speech is loved by the gods, not by others.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b06_17']	然依語聲分位差別而假建立名句文身，名詮自性，句詮差別，文即是字為二所依。	然依語聲分位差別而假建立名句文身，名詮自性，句詮差別，文即是字為二所依。	002	However, names, phrases, and syllables are established by imputation based on the distinctions in the states of the sound of speech. Names express intrinsic nature, phrases express distinctions, and letters are the basis of the other two.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b07_16']	此三離聲雖無別體，而假實異亦不即聲。	此三離聲雖無別體，而假實異亦不即聲。	002	Although these three are not separate from sound and do not have a separate substance, they are different in being imputed and real, and they are also not the same as sound.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b09_6']	由此法詞二無礙解境有差別，聲與名等蘊處界攝亦各有異。	由此法詞二無礙解境有差別，聲與名等蘊處界攝亦各有異。	002	For this reason, the objects of the two unobstructed abilities of teaching and understanding the Dharma are different. Sound and names, etc., are categorized as aggregates, sense bases, and sense fields in different ways.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b11_6']	且依此土說名句文依聲假立，非謂一切，諸餘佛土亦依光明妙香味等假立三故。	且依此土說名句文依聲假立，非謂一切，諸餘佛土亦依光明妙香味等假立三故。	002	Moreover, we say that names, phrases, and syllables are established on the basis of sound only in this world, not in all places, because in other buddha lands the three are established on the basis of light, wonderful smells, tastes, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b12_6']	有執隨眠異心心所，是不相應行蘊所攝。	有執隨眠異心心所，是不相應行蘊所攝。	002	There is an opinion that propensities are different from mind and its activities and are included in the aggregate of formations not associated with mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b13_7']	彼亦非理，名貪等故，如現貪等，非不相應。	彼亦非理，名貪等故，如現貪等，非不相應。	002	This also is unreasonable, because they are called craving, etc., just as actual craving, etc., are not not associated with mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b14_6']	執別有餘不相應行，准前理趣皆應遮止。	執別有餘不相應行，准前理趣皆應遮止。	002	Other dharmas not associated with mind that are held to exist should be refuted in the same way.

['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b21_7']	無為非世共知定有，又無作用如眼耳等，設許有用應是無常，故不可執無為定有。	無為非世共知定有，又無作用如眼耳等，設許有用應是無常，故不可執無為定有。	002	Unconditioned dharmas are not definitely known to exist by the world in general, and they do not function like eyes, ears, etc. Even if you admit that they function, they must be impermanent. Therefore, you cannot maintain that unconditioned dharmas definitely exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b23_7']	然諸無為所知性故，或色心等所顯性故，如色心等，不應執為離色心等實無為性。	然諸無為所知性故，或色心等所顯性故，如色心等，不應執為離色心等實無為性。	002	However, because unconditioned dharmas are the nature of knowables, or because they are manifested by form, mind, etc., like form and mind, etc., you cannot maintain that they are unconditioned dharmas that are real substances apart from form and mind, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b23_16']	又虛空等為一為多？	又虛空等為一為多？	002	Also, are such dharmas as space one or many?

['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b26_6']	一所合處餘不合故，不爾諸法應互相遍。	一所合處餘不合故，不爾諸法應互相遍。	002	If it is not so, then dharmas must interpenetrate.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006b27_7']	若謂虛空不與法合，應非容受，如餘無為。	若謂虛空不與法合，應非容受，如餘無為。	002	If you claim that space does not combine with dharmas, then it must not contain them, just like other unconditioned dharmas.

['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006c04_7']	餘部所執離心心所實有無為，准前應破。	餘部所執離心心所實有無為，准前應破。	002	The real unconditioned dharmas grasped by other Buddhist schools must be refuted in the same way.

['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006c06_2']	然契經說有虛空等。	然契經說有虛空等。	002	However, a scripture says that there is space, etc.

['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006c09_1']	一依識變假施設有，謂曾聞說虛空等名，隨分別有虛空等相，數習力故心等生時，似虛空等無為相現。	一依識變假施設有，謂曾聞說虛空等名，隨分別有虛空等相，數習力故心等生時，似虛空等無為相現。	002	One is that which is provisionally established as existing on the basis of transformations of consciousness, that is, having heard the name space, etc., one discriminates the characteristics of space, etc., and because of the power of habit, when mind, etc., is born, it appears in the form of the characteristics of space, etc., as unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006c10_1']	此所現相，前後相似無有變易，假說為常。	此所現相，前後相似無有變易，假說為常。	002	The characteristics that appear are similar before and after and do not change, and it is provisionally said that they are permanent.
['ZH_T31_1585_002:0006c13_1']	二依法性假施設有，謂空無我所顯真如，有無俱非、心言路絕，與一切法非一異等，是法真理故名法性，離諸障礙故名虛空。	二依法性假施設有，謂空無我所顯真如，有無俱非、心言路絕，與一切法非一異等，是法真理故名法性，離諸障礙故名虛空。	002	The second is that of the provisional establishment of existence in dependence on the nature of dharmas, that is, true suchness revealed by emptiness and nonself, which is neither existent nor nonexistent, and beyond the path of mind and words. It is neither identical with nor different from all dharmas, and is the reality of dharmas, and for that reason it is called the nature of dharmas. It is free of all obstacles and for that reason it is called space.

That is, it is the cause of the impure dharmas and is in turn their result, and sentient beings grasp it as an inner self.🔽It is called retribution because it is the result of impure good and bad actions.
