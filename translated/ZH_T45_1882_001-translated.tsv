['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b03_8']	普賢表所證法界，即出纏如來藏，「善財童子入其身」故。	普賢表所證法界，即出纏如來藏，「善財童子入其身」故。	001	Samantabhadra represents the realized Dharma realm, which is the liberated tathāgatagarbha, because Sudhana entered his body.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b03_11']	又云：	又云：	001	It also says:

['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b15_2']	此之一門，古德親問，三藏言：	此之一門，古德親問，三藏言：	001	Regarding this one approach, ancient masters personally asked the Tripiṭaka master:

['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b17_13']	亦表體用，普賢理寂，以為心體，文殊智照，為大用故。	亦表體用，普賢理寂，以為心體，文殊智照，為大用故。	001	it also represents essence and function, because Samantabhadra's principle is quiescent, serving as the essence of the mind, and Mañjuśrī's wisdom-illumination is the great function.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b18_4']	第二、相融顯圓者，亦二：	第二、相融顯圓者，亦二：	001	Second, the mutual interpenetration and manifestation of the perfect [truth]: this also has two parts:
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b18_16']	先、明二聖法門各自圓融：	先、明二聖法門各自圓融：	001	First, clarifying that the Dharma approaches of the two sages each have perfect interpenetration:
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b19_8', 'ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b19_18']	謂文殊必因於信，方能成解。🔽有解無信，增邪見故；	謂文殊必因於信，方能成解。 有解無信，增邪見故；	001	It means that Mañjuśrī must rely on faith in order to accomplish understanding.🔽If there is understanding without faith, it increases wrong views;
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b20_7']	有信無解，長無明故。	有信無解，長無明故。	001	if there is faith without understanding, it prolongs ignorance.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b20_17']	信解真正，方了本原；	信解真正，方了本原；	001	Only when faith and understanding are genuine can one understand the original source;
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b21_11']	成其極智，極智反照，不異初心；	成其極智，極智反照，不異初心；	001	when ultimate wisdom is attained, it illuminates back to the original mind without difference.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b22_1']	故初發心時，便成正覺。	故初發心時，便成正覺。	001	Therefore, when one first generates the resolve, one immediately attains perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b22_15']	又，前方便之智，不離智體故；	又，前方便之智，不離智體故；	001	Moreover, the wisdom of previous skillful means is not separate from the essence of wisdom;
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b23_4']	後文殊名智，照無二相。	後文殊名智，照無二相。	001	later, Mañjuśrī's name is wisdom, illuminating without duality.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b24_14']	照信不殊於智，故從無身相而展右手，是以文殊三事，融通隱隱。	照信不殊於智，故從無身相而展右手，是以文殊三事，融通隱隱。	001	Illuminating faith is not different from wisdom, therefore, from the appearance of no body, he extends his right hand, thus Mañjuśrī's three matters are fused and indistinct.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b25_4']	次、普賢三事自相融者：	次、普賢三事自相融者：	001	Next, the three matters of Samantabhadra are fused with each other:
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b25_14']	理若無行，理終不顯；	理若無行，理終不顯；	001	If principle lacks practice, the principle will never be revealed;
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b26_3', 'ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b26_15']	依體起行，行必稱體。🔽由行證理，理無行外之理；	依體起行，行必稱體。 由行證理，理無行外之理；	001	based on the essence to give rise to practice, the practice must accord with the essence.🔽Because practice realizes the principle, the principle has no principle outside of practice;
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b27_6']	由理顯行，無理外之行故。	由理顯行，無理外之行故。	001	because the principle reveals the practice, there is no practice outside of the principle.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671b29_7']	隨所證理，無不具一證一切證，故見普賢一毛所得法門，過前不可說倍，又是即體之用故。	隨所證理，無不具一證一切證，故見普賢一毛所得法門，過前不可說倍，又是即體之用故。	001	According to the realized truth, there is none that does not possess one realization and all realizations. Therefore, seeing the Dharma gates obtained by one hair of Samantabhadra surpasses the previous inconceivably. Moreover, it is because this is the function of the essence.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c01_9']	「毛」、「孔」法門，緣起無盡，由是普賢三事，涉入重重。	「毛」、「孔」法門，緣起無盡，由是普賢三事，涉入重重。	001	The Dharma gates of hair and pores arise in dependence and are inexhaustible. Therefore, the three matters of Samantabhadra interpenetrate repeatedly.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c02_1', 'ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c02_13']	二者、二聖法門互相融者：🔽謂要因於信，方知法界信；	二者、二聖法門互相融者： 謂要因於信，方知法界信；	001	Second, the Dharma gates of the two sages mutually merge:
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c03_2']	不信理，信即為邪故。	不信理，信即為邪故。	001	It is necessary to rely on faith in order to know the Dharma realm. Faith in the principle is not faith, and then faith becomes deviant.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c03_8']	能、所不二。	能、所不二。	001	The able and the receptive are not two.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c04_1', 'ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c05_8']	不信自心有如來藏，非菩薩故。🔽次、要藉於解，方能起行，稱解起行，行不異解，則解、行不二。	不信自心有如來藏，非菩薩故。 次、要藉於解，方能起行，稱解起行，行不異解，則解、行不二。	001	If one does not believe that one's own mind has the Tathāgatagarbha, one is not a bodhisattva.🔽Next, it is necessary to rely on understanding in order to be able to give rise to practice. In accordance with understanding, one gives rise to practice. If practice does not differ from understanding, then understanding and practice are not two.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c06_20']	次、以智是理用，體理成智，還照於理，智與理冥，方曰真智，則理、智無二。	次、以智是理用，體理成智，還照於理，智與理冥，方曰真智，則理、智無二。	001	Next, since wisdom is the function of principle, by embodying the principle and perfecting the wisdom, one illuminates the principle. Wisdom and principle merge, and only then is it called true wisdom. Then principle and wisdom are not two.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c07_5']	故《經》云：	故《經》云：	001	Therefore, the sutra says:
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c08_4']	「無有如外智能證於如，亦無智外如為智所入。	「無有如外智能證於如，亦無智外如為智所入。	001	There is no suchness outside of cognition that can realize suchness, nor is there suchness outside of cognition for cognition to enter.

['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c09_15']	觀窮數極，妙符乎寂，即定慧不二。	觀窮數極，妙符乎寂，即定慧不二。	001	Contemplation reaching the limit of enumeration, wondrously accords with quiescence, which is the non-duality of concentration and wisdom.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c10_16']	又，即體之用曰智，即用之體曰理，即體用無二。	又，即體之用曰智，即用之體曰理，即體用無二。	001	Moreover, the function that is the essence is called cognition, and the essence that is the function is called principle. The essence and function are non-dual.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c12_12']	是以文殊三事融通隱隱，即是普賢三事涉入重重，此二不異，名普賢帝網之行。	是以文殊三事融通隱隱，即是普賢三事涉入重重，此二不異，名普賢帝網之行。	001	Therefore, the three matters of Mañjuśrī are fused and hidden, which are precisely the many layers of the three matters of Samantabhadra that interpenetrate. These two are no different, and are called the web of Samantabhadra's practices.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c13_16']	故〈普賢行品〉，反上下諸經，廣顯理事圓融，為普賢行；	故〈普賢行品〉，反上下諸經，廣顯理事圓融，為普賢行；	001	Therefore, the chapter on Samantabhadra's practices reverses the sequence of the various sutras above and below, extensively revealing the perfect fusion of principle and phenomena, as Samantabhadra's practices;
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c14_6']	非獨事行，名普賢行。	非獨事行，名普賢行。	001	not only the practices of phenomena, are called Samantabhadra's practices.
['ZH_T45_1882_001:0671c15_16']	既二聖相融而不名文殊行者，攝智屬理，唯一心法界故，舉一全收。	既二聖相融而不名文殊行者，攝智屬理，唯一心法界故，舉一全收。	001	Since the two sages fuse with each other and are not called Mañjuśrī's practices, subsuming cognition into principle, there is only the dharma realm of one mind, which is completely included in taking up one.
