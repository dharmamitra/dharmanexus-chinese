Therefore, the nature of principled goodness and evil is mutually exclusive. When principled goodness arises, principled evil must cease, and there is no prior cessation of evil before principled goodness arises.
['ZH_T33_1717_012:0901b07_1']	若事中善惡其性亦相傾，善生之時未必惡滅，惡滅之時未必善生。	若事中善惡其性亦相傾，善生之時未必惡滅，惡滅之時未必善生。	If the nature of goodness and evil in phenomena is also mutually exclusive, then when goodness arises, evil does not necessarily cease, and when evil ceases, goodness does not necessarily arise.
['ZH_T33_1717_012:0901b08_1']	故於生善以分事理，理善即屬第一義義。	故於生善以分事理，理善即屬第一義義。	Therefore, in terms of cultivating goodness, the distinction between phenomena and principle is made. Principled goodness belongs to the meaning of ultimate truth.

['ZH_T33_1717_012:0901b09_5']	惡滅即屬對治義也。	惡滅即屬對治義也。	When evil ceases, it belongs to the meaning of counteracting.
['ZH_T33_1717_012:0901b11_5']	理惡即滅、理善即生，故於生善以分二悉，滅惡唯得立一對治，惡無先滅故不分二。	理惡即滅、理善即生，故於生善以分二悉，滅惡唯得立一對治，惡無先滅故不分二。	Since principled evil ceases and principled goodness arises, the distinction between the two aspects of benefiting and counteracting is made in terms of cultivating goodness. The cessation of evil can only establish one aspect of countering, because evil does not necessarily cease prior [to goodness], so the distinction between two aspects is not made.

There, one can give rise to and perfect the potential of hell. The other eight realms can be understood in the same way.

However, the various layers and interchanges among the ten realms cannot be fully known. For now, I will discuss this based on a general direction and the majority of cases. If the mind of the Buddha realm is strong, it is already called the Buddha realm. If it benefits the nine realms, it is called the Buddha realm having the capacities of the nine realms.
['ZH_T33_1717_012:0903b03_16']	若已墮九界則名九界有佛界機，如惡業深重本是地獄名地獄界，曾聞一句可為佛因，聖人亦以冥顯應之，是名地獄有佛界機。	若已墮九界則名九界有佛界機，如惡業深重本是地獄名地獄界，曾聞一句可為佛因，聖人亦以冥顯應之，是名地獄有佛界機。	If it has already fallen into the nine realms, it is called the nine realms having the capacities of the Buddha realm. For example, if evil karma is deep and heavy, one is originally in the hells and is called the hell realm. If one has heard a single phrase that can be a cause for Buddhahood, sages will also respond to it through the manifest and unmanifest. This is called the hells having the capacities of the Buddha realm.

Therefore, the eight realms are used as skillful means, which is called the hells having the capacities of the eight realms. Therefore, it is known that the lower realms have the capacities of the higher realms, and the higher realms have the capacities of the lower realms. The characteristics of these are different. Since this is the case for the higher and lower realms, the interchanges among the middle realms can be understood based on this explanation. Therefore, it should be known that each realm is fully endowed with the nine realms.

This is an example, like pulling out the happiness of humans and gods and giving them the suffering of transformation and change, pulling out the happiness of nirvana and giving them the suffering of entering the provisional, pulling out the happiness of discrimination and giving them the suffering of true reward, or pulling out shallow happiness and manifesting giving suffering.
