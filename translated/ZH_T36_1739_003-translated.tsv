In the second life, they still come from evil realms, are illuminated by light, and are born in the Tuṣita Heaven. They attain the samādhi of being free from defilements, and then see the Tathāgata dwelling on the adamantine jewel ground, transforming great bodhisattvas, who have just entered their mother's womb in Jambudvīpa.
