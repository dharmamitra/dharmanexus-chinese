['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b21_8']	12 十二辯差別品第二之十二如是因緣有何差別？	12 十二辯差別品第二之十二如是因緣有何差別？	Chapter 12, part 12 on the distinctions in the twelve [links of dependent origination], as the twelve [links of dependent origination] and conditions have what differences?
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b21_18']	此就實體，差別都無。	此就實體，差別都無。	From the perspective of real entities, there are absolutely no differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b22_7']	應說因緣如何相攝。	應說因緣如何相攝。	One should explain how the twelve [links of dependent origination] and conditions are mutually inclusive.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b23_9']	我前已說，因緣五因性，增上即能作，何復生疑？	我前已說，因緣五因性，增上即能作，何復生疑？	I have previously explained that the five causes are the nature of conditions, and the dominant condition is precisely the efficient cause. Why then give rise to doubt?
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b24_7']	所餘二緣未辯因攝，故今於此猶可生疑。	所餘二緣未辯因攝，故今於此猶可生疑。	The remaining two conditions have yet to be determined as being included in the causes, so now in this [discussion] one may still give rise to doubt.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b24_12']	有作是言：	有作是言：	There are those who say:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b25_17']	同類、遍行二因各少分名等無間緣，皆約已生位無別故。	同類、遍行二因各少分名等無間緣，皆約已生位無別故。	The two causes of the same type and universal each partially constitute the immediately preceding condition, because they are the same in terms of what has already arisen.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b26_8']	無如是理，果有異故。	無如是理，果有異故。	This is not the correct principle, because the effect is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b26_19']	豈不一切因皆有士用果？	豈不一切因皆有士用果？	Aren't all causes the effect of human effort and function?
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b28_3']	若法有力能生於彼或得於彼，彼是此法士用果故。	若法有力能生於彼或得於彼，彼是此法士用果故。	If a dharma has the power to give rise to that, or to obtain that, that is the effect of human effort and function of this dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449b28_17']	不爾，二因俱等流果義所顯故。	不爾，二因俱等流果義所顯故。	If this were not so, the two causes would be the same in being the cause of similar and immediately antecedent conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c01_5']	又善不善、有漏無漏、界地等別，同異皆是等無間緣之士用果。	又善不善、有漏無漏、界地等別，同異皆是等無間緣之士用果。	Also, the distinctions of good and bad, contaminated and uncontaminated, realm, stage, etc., are all the dominant results of the similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c02_4']	二因之果唯據類同，故與此緣非無差別。	二因之果唯據類同，故與此緣非無差別。	The results of the two causes are only based on the same class, and therefore they are not without distinctions from this condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c04_12']	豈不二因之等流果亦兼有異，如欲纏繫見苦所斷二因所牽自部等流有記無記，此亦染污，其類是同。	豈不二因之等流果亦兼有異，如欲纏繫見苦所斷二因所牽自部等流有記無記，此亦染污，其類是同。	Are not the results of the two causes also different, such as the defiled and undefiled results of the same class, which are drawn by the two causes that are eliminated by seeing suffering in the desire realm? These are also the same in being defiled.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c05_11']	有漏無漏、界地等異，二因必無，故非無別。	有漏無漏、界地等異，二因必無，故非無別。	There is a difference between contaminated and uncontaminated, realm, stage, etc., and the two causes must not exist, and therefore they are not without distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c07_11']	若爾，已生心心所法，相應、俱有二因攝故，應皆不立等無間緣，此與二因之士用果其相各別。	若爾，已生心心所法，相應、俱有二因攝故，應皆不立等無間緣，此與二因之士用果其相各別。	If this were so, then the associated and coexistent two causes would not be established as the similar and immediately antecedent condition because they are included in the dominant result of the two causes, and their characteristics are each different.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c08_7']	此無間生，與彼俱生，果有異故。	此無間生，與彼俱生，果有異故。	This is because the result that arises immediately after is different from that which arises simultaneously with them.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c09_1']	豈不二因亦有無間生士用果？	豈不二因亦有無間生士用果？	Aren’t there also two causes that produce the result of the dominant condition without interval?
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c11_11']	無如是義，以心心所能生無間士用果力，應知即是等無間緣，非是俱有、相應因用，二因唯有能得俱生士用果力。	無如是義，以心心所能生無間士用果力，應知即是等無間緣，非是俱有、相應因用，二因唯有能得俱生士用果力。	There is no such principle, because the power of mind and mental activities to produce the result of the dominant condition without interval should be known as the condition as object. It is not the function of the two causes of co-existent and associated causes. The two causes only have the power to obtain the result of the dominant condition that arises simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c13_14']	以心心所能引俱生士用果義，即名俱有、相應二因引無間生士用果義，應知即是等無間緣。	以心心所能引俱生士用果義，即名俱有、相應二因引無間生士用果義，應知即是等無間緣。	Because the power of mind and mental activities to attract the result of the dominant condition that arises simultaneously is called the two causes of co-existent and associated causes, the power to attract the result of the dominant condition that arises without interval should be known as the condition as object.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c15_3']	如引俱生果雖無別，而依異義別立二因，體雖相雜而義有異。	如引俱生果雖無別，而依異義別立二因，體雖相雜而義有異。	Even though there is no difference in attracting the simultaneously born result, the two causes are established separately on the basis of different meanings. Even though the substance is mixed, there is a difference in meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c16_2']	二因對彼等無間緣，義別體同，應知亦爾。	二因對彼等無間緣，義別體同，應知亦爾。	The two causes and the condition as object are similar in substance but different in meaning. You should understand that this is also the case.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c16_11']	故等無間非即諸因。	故等無間非即諸因。	Therefore the condition as object is not the same as the various causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c17_1']	其所緣緣，為即因不？	其所緣緣，為即因不？	Is the condition as object the same as the various causes?
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c17_6']	有作是說：	有作是說：	There is an opinion that
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c17_20']	即能作因，以體與果俱相似故。	即能作因，以體與果俱相似故。	it is the efficient cause, because its substance is similar to the result.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c18_11']	豈不所緣緣，士用果為果。	豈不所緣緣，士用果為果。	Aren't the object-condition and the dominant fruit the fruit of the efficient cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c18_16']	有作是說：	有作是說：	There is an explanation:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c19_5']	此所緣緣果唯增上。	此所緣緣果唯增上。	This object-condition fruit is only the dominant fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c20_2']	或復能作因亦有士用果，故無有失。	或復能作因亦有士用果，故無有失。	Or, the efficient cause also has the dominant fruit, so there is no error.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c21_1']	若爾，俱有、相應二因，應如所緣，能作因攝。	若爾，俱有、相應二因，應如所緣，能作因攝。	If so, the co-existent cause and the associated cause should be included in the object-condition, like the efficient cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c21_13']	然非所緣緣，展轉增上果；	然非所緣緣，展轉增上果；	However, they are not the object-condition, the dominant fruit that mutually increases,
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c22_13']	亦非士用果，從所緣緣生，故無體果俱相似義。	亦非士用果，從所緣緣生，故無體果俱相似義。	nor are they the dominant fruit, because they arise from the object-condition, so there is no similar meaning of having a substance fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c24_2']	是故有釋因緣差別，不遍是因、遍者是緣，攝不攝故，如指指節。	是故有釋因緣差別，不遍是因、遍者是緣，攝不攝故，如指指節。	Therefore, some explain that the distinction of the causal condition is that the non-pervading is the cause, and the pervading is the condition, because of inclusion and non-inclusion, like a finger and the finger joints.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c25_11']	是故不見等無間緣及所緣緣有因攝義，此與因別，理不待言。	是故不見等無間緣及所緣緣有因攝義，此與因別，理不待言。	Therefore, one does not see the equal-immediate condition and the object-condition having the meaning of being included in the cause. The distinction of these from the cause does not need to be stated.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c26_2']	唯初後二緣，應辯與因別。	唯初後二緣，應辯與因別。	Only the first two conditions should be distinguished from the cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c28_10']	此既有別，餘之二緣緣義等故，亦應有別，故有總辯緣因異言，謂因能生、緣能長養，猶如生養二母差別。	此既有別，餘之二緣緣義等故，亦應有別，故有總辯緣因異言，謂因能生、緣能長養，猶如生養二母差別。	Since these two are different, the other two conditions must also be different, since their meanings are equal. Therefore, in general, the words “cause” and “condition” are distinguished. A cause is able to produce, and a condition is able to nourish, just as there is a difference between a mother who gives birth and a mother who nourishes.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0449c29_14']	又緣攝助、因方能生，生已相續、緣力長養，故或有說：	又緣攝助、因方能生，生已相續、緣力長養，故或有說：	Also, a condition assists and embraces, and a cause is able to produce. Having been produced, it continues in a series, and the power of conditions nourishes it. Therefore, some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a01_12']	因唯有一，緣乃有多，猶如種子糞土等異。	因唯有一，緣乃有多，猶如種子糞土等異。	Causes are only one, but conditions are many, just as seeds, soil, and manure are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a02_7']	又因不共，共者是緣，如眼如色。	又因不共，共者是緣，如眼如色。	Also, a cause is not common, but what is common is a condition, just as the eye is not common, but form is common.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a03_14']	又作自事說名為因，若作他事說名為緣，即如種子糞土等異。	又作自事說名為因，若作他事說名為緣，即如種子糞土等異。	Also, that which performs its own function is called a cause, and that which performs the function of another is called a condition, just as seeds, soil, and manure are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a04_18']	又能引起說名為因，能任持者說名為緣，如花如蔕。	又能引起說名為因，能任持者說名為緣，如花如蔕。	Also, that which is able to induce is called a cause, and that which is able to support is called a condition, just as a flower is able to induce, and a pistil is able to support.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a05_13']	又因名近，遠者名緣，如珠如日。	又因名近，遠者名緣，如珠如日。	Also, a cause is called near, and a distant one is called a condition, just as a jewel is near, and the sun is distant.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a07_19']	又因能生，緣者能辦，猶如從酪出於生酥，鑽器人功力所能辦，非鑽器等令水出酥，以於水中闕酥因故。	又因能生，緣者能辦，猶如從酪出於生酥，鑽器人功力所能辦，非鑽器等令水出酥，以於水中闕酥因故。	Also, causes are able to produce, while conditions are able to accomplish, just as from milk comes curd, and from churning curd comes butter. The power of the churning implements and human effort is able to accomplish this, but churning implements and so on cannot cause water to produce butter, because the cause of butter is lacking in water.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a09_8']	如斯等類差別眾多，是故因緣別立名想，由其功力有差別故。	如斯等類差別眾多，是故因緣別立名想，由其功力有差別故。	There are many such distinctions. Therefore, causes and conditions are established separately as names and concepts, because their power is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a10_16']	又正有義故說為因，能助顯發故說為緣，如字界緣於義有別。	又正有義故說為因，能助顯發故說為緣，如字界緣於義有別。	Also, because of the correct meaning, it is called a cause, and because it can assist and manifest, it is called a condition, just as the conditions of letters and syllables have a difference in meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a12_14']	然契經說二因二緣生正見者，言音作意近遠等生無漏正見，約此義顯因緣二名。	然契經說二因二緣生正見者，言音作意近遠等生無漏正見，約此義顯因緣二名。	However, the sutra says that the two causes and two conditions give rise to right view. The sound of speech, attention, near and far, etc. give rise to the uncontaminated right view. The names of causes and conditions are manifested based on this meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a14_3']	又契經說有因有緣有由序者，此顯俱起無間遠因義有差別。	又契經說有因有緣有由序者，此顯俱起無間遠因義有差別。	Also, the sutra says there are causes, there are conditions, and there are sequences. This manifests the meaning of the simultaneous, immediate, and distant causes having distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a15_10']	又契經說眼因色緣生眼識者，意顯眼識隨不共根及共境起。	又契經說眼因色緣生眼識者，意顯眼識隨不共根及共境起。	Also, the sutra says the eye is the cause and form is the condition for the arising of eye-consciousness. The meaning is manifested that eye-consciousness arises according to the unique faculties and the shared objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a16_18']	又契經說此因此緣此由序者，此中意顯作者作具及餘助緣。	又契經說此因此緣此由序者，此中意顯作者作具及餘助緣。	Also, a scripture says, “This is the cause, this is the condition, this is the reason.” The meaning of this is that the agent, the instrument, and other assisting conditions are the causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a17_9', 'ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a17_18']	如是等經，隨義應釋。🔽已隨理教廣辯諸緣。	如是等經，隨義應釋。 已隨理教廣辯諸緣。	Such scriptures should be explained according to their meaning.🔽In this way, we have extensively explained the various conditions according to reason and the teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a19_6']	如是諸緣顯法生滅以為作用，應說何緣於何位法而興作用？	如是諸緣顯法生滅以為作用，應說何緣於何位法而興作用？	We should now explain in which state of dharmas the various conditions function.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a19_9']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a20_0']	二因於正滅，　　三因於正生，	二因於正滅，　　三因於正生，	The two causes function on dharmas that are about to perish, the three causes function on dharmas that are about to be born,
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a21_13']	餘二緣相違，　　而興於作用。	餘二緣相違，　　而興於作用。	The remaining two conditions function in the opposite way, and thus they arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a22_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a23_1']	前說五因為因緣性，二因作用於正滅時。	前說五因為因緣性，二因作用於正滅時。	The five causes mentioned above are the nature of the condition as cause. The two causes function on dharmas that are about to perish.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a23_19']	正滅時言顯法現在滅現前故，名正滅時。	正滅時言顯法現在滅現前故，名正滅時。	The phrase about to perish refers to dharmas in the present, because their cessation is imminent, so they are called about to perish.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a24_18']	俱有、相應二因，於法滅現前位而作功能。	俱有、相應二因，於法滅現前位而作功能。	The two causes of co-existence and association function on dharmas in the state of imminent cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a26_7']	此位二因作功能者，謂俱生品隨闕一時，作用皆無，不能取境。	此位二因作功能者，謂俱生品隨闕一時，作用皆無，不能取境。	The two causes function in this state, meaning that when one of the co-existent factors is missing, their function is absent and they cannot grasp their objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a27_14']	於現在位，如是二因雖俱一時取果與果，而今但約與果功能。	於現在位，如是二因雖俱一時取果與果，而今但約與果功能。	Although these two causes take and give effects simultaneously in the present, we are now speaking only of the power to give effects.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450a29_3']	所言三因於正生者，謂未來法於正生位生現前故，名正生時。	所言三因於正生者，謂未來法於正生位生現前故，名正生時。	The three causes in regard to that which is presently arising means that future dharmas are called presently arising because they are about to arise and become present.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b01_2']	同類、遍行、異熟三種，法正生位而作功能。	同類、遍行、異熟三種，法正生位而作功能。	The three causes of similar kind, universal, and retribution function in the state of presently arising dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b01_7']	故有說言：	故有說言：	Therefore there is a saying:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b03_8']	等流、異熟二果，因力牽引，令生同類遍行，容有無間等流果起，可言彼果於正生時因興作用。	等流、異熟二果，因力牽引，令生同類遍行，容有無間等流果起，可言彼果於正生時因興作用。	The two results of similar cause and retribution are drawn by the power of the cause, and the result of similar cause may arise without interval in the presently arising state, and it can be said that the cause functions in the presently arising result.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b04_16']	異熟因果必隔遠時，其因久滅果方正起，如何作用在果生時？	異熟因果必隔遠時，其因久滅果方正起，如何作用在果生時？	The cause and result of retribution are necessarily separated by a long time. The cause has long since ceased, and the result is just now arising. How can the function exist in the presently arising result?
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b06_7']	非過去時可有作用，此言作用意顯功能，二相別中已曾思擇。	非過去時可有作用，此言作用意顯功能，二相別中已曾思擇。	It is not possible for the past to have function. This word function indicates power, and the difference between the two characteristics has already been considered.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b07_6']	以因雖滅經無量時，而有功能令自果起。	以因雖滅經無量時，而有功能令自果起。	Although the cause has ceased and passed through an immeasurable period of time, it has the ability to cause its own effect to arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b08_14']	由不共故，自果生時作用雖無，而於自果與功能上立作用名。	由不共故，自果生時作用雖無，而於自果與功能上立作用名。	Because it is unique, although the function does not exist at the time when its own effect arises, it is given the name function in regard to the ability with regard to its own effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b09_1']	彼上座言：	彼上座言：	The Sthavira says:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b11_12']	一剎那頃難說此是生時滅時，非法由因先生後滅，如杖持羂內蛇穴中，繫頸挽出方斷其命，然體本無，由因故有。	一剎那頃難說此是生時滅時，非法由因先生後滅，如杖持羂內蛇穴中，繫頸挽出方斷其命，然體本無，由因故有。	It is difficult to say in a single moment which is the time of birth and which is the time of cessation. It is not that dharmas first arise and then subsequently cease, like a snake that is drawn out by the neck and finally killed with a stick inside a hole. However, the substance originally does not exist and exists due to a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b12_11']	彼說但是掉舉戲言，引非所宗，鄙俚言故。	彼說但是掉舉戲言，引非所宗，鄙俚言故。	What he says is just frivolous talk, citing what is not accepted by the school because it is vulgar speech.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b14_16']	非對法者許法由因先生後滅同繫蛇喻，但由緣起理趣法然，為曉學徒說取與用，顯於果起因有功能。	非對法者許法由因先生後滅同繫蛇喻，但由緣起理趣法然，為曉學徒說取與用，顯於果起因有功能。	Those who do not accept the Abhidharma do not accept that dharmas first arise and then subsequently cease, like a snake that is tied up, but only that dharmas are naturally so due to the principle of dependent origination. In order to make students understand, they speak of the function of taking up and laying down, manifesting the ability of a cause to give rise to an effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b15_6']	故彼所言唯增掉戲。	故彼所言唯增掉戲。	Therefore what he says only increases frivolousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b15_11']	又彼所言：	又彼所言：	Moreover, what he says:
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b16_5']	一剎那頃難說此是生時滅時。	一剎那頃難說此是生時滅時。	It is difficult to say in a single moment which is the time of birth and which is the time of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_020:0450b18_12']	彼恒尋思麁淺異論，尚年已過居衰耄時，豈能測量幼恒思擇一切智者詮至理言，修成妙慧所遊宗極？	彼恒尋思麁淺異論，尚年已過居衰耄時，豈能測量幼恒思擇一切智者詮至理言，修成妙慧所遊宗極？	They constantly seek out coarse and shallow heterodox theories.
