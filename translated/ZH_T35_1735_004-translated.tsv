Although in different places and times, they are not separate. It is only because they rely on the defiled land to manifest the pure that they must be in sequence.

Therefore, in the Dharma realm, the light emitted also sees bodhisattvas universally seated in the site of enlightenment, attaining perfect enlightenment.

The Dharma body pervades everywhere and is the common support of the world, the wisdom body realizes the truth and is everywhere like the truth, and the form body is unobstructed and also pervades everywhere like the truth. All of these are perfect and universal, and not partial and universal. It means that in every subtle dust mote and so forth in all worlds, the Buddha is completely perfect. If one looks at it as a whole, it appears; if one looks at it separately, it also appears.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b11_1']	一順異類言音，經云「一切眾生語言法，一言演說盡無餘」故。	一順異類言音，經云「一切眾生語言法，一言演說盡無餘」故。	004	First, it accords with the language of different species. The sutra says: In one word, all the languages and dharmas of sentient beings are expounded without remainder.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b12_7']	二順所宜說法，「如來於一語言中，演說無邊契經海」故。	二順所宜說法，「如來於一語言中，演說無邊契經海」故。	004	Second, it accords with the Dharma that should be expounded. In one word of the Tathagata, the ocean of sutras is expounded without limit.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b17_9']	然虛空喻有同不同，故下經云「解如來身非如虛空，一切妙法所圓滿」等，此顯不同。	然虛空喻有同不同，故下經云「解如來身非如虛空，一切妙法所圓滿」等，此顯不同。	004	However, the analogy of space has similarities and differences. Therefore, the following sutra says, Understanding the Tathagata's body is not like space, but is perfected by all wondrous dharmas. This shows the differences.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b19_17']	二普遍喻，兼遍入義。	二普遍喻，兼遍入義。	004	The second is the analogy of pervasiveness, which also includes the meaning of universal entry.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b22_3']	量智包含而普遍，理智無分別而證入。	量智包含而普遍，理智無分別而證入。	004	The wisdom of measureless inclusion and pervasiveness, and the non-discriminating realization of the wisdom of reality.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b24_17']	下經云「菩提智普現一切眾生心念根欲等，而無所現。	下經云「菩提智普現一切眾生心念根欲等，而無所現。	004	The following sutra says, The wisdom of enlightenment universally manifests the thoughts, faculties, and desires of all sentient beings, yet there is nothing manifested.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b25_7']	」無所現言無有分別。	」無所現言無有分別。	004	No appearance means no discrimination.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532b28_1']	無分別言顯無差別故，下經云「於一切義無所觀察」等。	無分別言顯無差別故，下經云「於一切義無所觀察」等。	004	The phrase no discrimination shows the absence of distinctions. The sutra below says not observing any meaning and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c03_1']	是以太虛能含眾像、眾像不能含太虛，太虛不分別眾像、眾像乃差別太虛，以況我法不能容佛智、佛智乃能容我法，有我法者分別如來、是如來者不分別我法。	是以太虛能含眾像、眾像不能含太虛，太虛不分別眾像、眾像乃差別太虛，以況我法不能容佛智、佛智乃能容我法，有我法者分別如來、是如來者不分別我法。	004	Therefore, the great void can contain myriad forms, but myriad forms cannot contain the great void. The great void does not discriminate myriad forms, but myriad forms distinguish the great void. This is used to illustrate that the self and dharmas cannot contain the Buddha's wisdom, but the Buddha's wisdom can contain the self and dharmas. Those with self and dharmas discriminate the Tathāgata, but the Tathāgata does not discriminate the self and dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c04_2']	二普遍喻中，妙觀察智無不遍知，即普遍義。	二普遍喻中，妙觀察智無不遍知，即普遍義。	004	In the second, universal metaphor, the wondrous observation wisdom is all-pervading knowledge, which is the meaning of universality.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c07_1']	「悉了世間諸妄想」，此約智遍。	「悉了世間諸妄想」，此約智遍。	004	Fully understanding all worldly false thoughts refers to the universality of wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c07_18']	又云「得一切法界等心」，此約證遍。	又云「得一切法界等心」，此約證遍。	004	It also says attaining the mind equal to all dharma realms, which refers to the universality of realization.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c08_11']	智性全同於色性故，此約理遍。	智性全同於色性故，此約理遍。	004	Because the nature of wisdom is completely the same as the nature of form, this refers to the universality of principle.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c09_2']	云何遍入不壞能所？	云何遍入不壞能所？	004	How does universal entry not destroy the able and the acted upon?
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c09_7']	有證知故。	有證知故。	004	Because there is realization and knowledge.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c10_16']	故下經云「世間諸國土，一切皆隨入，智身無有色，非彼所能見。	故下經云「世間諸國土，一切皆隨入，智身無有色，非彼所能見。	004	Therefore, the following sutra says, All lands in the world are universally entered. The wisdom body has no form and cannot be seen by them.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c11_13']	」由隨於如，即入無所入，故云平等。	」由隨於如，即入無所入，故云平等。	004	Because of following suchness, one enters without entering, therefore it is called equality.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c14_16']	是以虛空遍入國土、國土不遍入虛空，有國土處必有虛空、有虛空處或無國土，虛空之於國土平等隨入、國土之於虛空自有彼此。	是以虛空遍入國土、國土不遍入虛空，有國土處必有虛空、有虛空處或無國土，虛空之於國土平等隨入、國土之於虛空自有彼此。	004	Therefore, space universally enters lands, but lands do not universally enter space. Where there are lands, there must be space; where there is space, there may or may not be lands. Space universally enters lands equally, but lands have their own this and that in relation to space.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c18_13']	虛空可喻佛智、國土可喻三世，三世有處佛智必在其中、佛智知處三世或無其體，佛智之於三世平等隨入、三世之於佛智自有始終，此猶約不二而二說耳。	虛空可喻佛智、國土可喻三世，三世有處佛智必在其中、佛智知處三世或無其體，佛智之於三世平等隨入、三世之於佛智自有始終，此猶約不二而二說耳。	004	Space can be used as a metaphor for the Buddha's wisdom, and the lands can be used as a metaphor for the three times. Where there are the three times, the Buddha's wisdom must be present within them. Where the Buddha's wisdom knows, the three times may not have their substance. The Buddha's wisdom equally enters the three times, while the three times have their beginning and end within the Buddha's wisdom. This is still speaking from the perspective of the non-duality of the two, but the two are distinguished.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c20_9']	若二而不二，國土、虛空、三世、佛智同一性故，皆互相入舉一全收，普遍亦然。	若二而不二，國土、虛空、三世、佛智同一性故，皆互相入舉一全收，普遍亦然。	004	If the two are not two, then the lands, space, three times, and Buddha's wisdom have the same nature, and they mutually enter each other. Mentioning one completely includes all, and pervasiveness is also like this.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c21_11', 'ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c22_17']	三世間圓融則言思道斷，故名佛智為不思議也。🔽次以二喻喻身業者，一毛尚容法界，全分必含眾像。	三世間圓融則言思道斷，故名佛智為不思議也。 次以二喻喻身業者，一毛尚容法界，全分必含眾像。	004	When the three worlds are perfectly integrated, words and thoughts are cut off. Therefore, the Buddha's wisdom is called inconceivable.🔽Next, two metaphors are used to illustrate the karmic activity of the body. Even a single hair can contain the Dharma realm, and the whole must contain myriad forms.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c25_3']	〈出現〉身業第二，喻云「譬如虛空寬廣非色，而能顯現一切諸色，而彼虛空無有分別亦無戲論。	〈出現〉身業第二，喻云「譬如虛空寬廣非色，而能顯現一切諸色，而彼虛空無有分別亦無戲論。	004	The second, the karmic activity of the body in the chapter on appearance, has a metaphor that says, It is like space, which is vast and not form, yet it can manifest all forms, while that space has no discrimination and also no idle discourse.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c26_7']	」合云「如來身亦復如是，一切眾生諸善根業皆得成就。	」合云「如來身亦復如是，一切眾生諸善根業皆得成就。	004	The body of the Tathāgata is also like this. All the wholesome roots and karmic activities of sentient beings can be accomplished.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c26_13']	」即含攝義。	」即含攝義。	004	This is the meaning of inclusion.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c27_9']	「而如來身無有分別」，即第二義。	「而如來身無有分別」，即第二義。	004	But the body of the Tathāgata is without discrimination, which is the second meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c28_2']	「佛身充滿於法界」，即普遍義。	「佛身充滿於法界」，即普遍義。	004	The Buddha's body fills the Dharma realm, which is the meaning of pervasiveness.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0532c29_5']	又云「譬如虛空遍至一切色非色處，非至非不至。	又云「譬如虛空遍至一切色非色處，非至非不至。	004	It also says, Just as space reaches everywhere, to places with form and places without form, yet it is neither reaching nor not reaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0533a01_11']	如來身亦復如是，遍一切法一切國土」等，即普遍義。	如來身亦復如是，遍一切法一切國土」等，即普遍義。	004	The body of the Tathāgata is also like this, pervading all dharmas and all lands, which is the meaning of pervasiveness.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0533a02_4']	「亦非至非不至」，即平等隨入義。	「亦非至非不至」，即平等隨入義。	004	Yet it is neither reaching nor not reaching, which is the meaning of equal and universal entry.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0533a05_8']	應知如來音聲無斷絕，普入法界故。	應知如來音聲無斷絕，普入法界故。	004	One should know that the voice of the Tathāgata is uninterrupted, because it universally enters the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0533a06_4']	又云「如來音聲無邪曲」，即平等義。	又云「如來音聲無邪曲」，即平等義。	004	It also says, The Tathagata's voice is without crookedness, which is the meaning of equality.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0533a06_20']	「隨其信解令歡喜故」，即隨入義。	「隨其信解令歡喜故」，即隨入義。	004	In accordance with their faith and understanding, causing them to rejoice, is the meaning of following entry.

These four meanings come because they are convenient.

['ZH_T35_1735_004:0533a24_3']	獨言菩薩，非不超餘，如日輪出照明世界，約喻以顯，映山出沒無隱顯故、處處全現無異體故，喻遍坐道場。	獨言菩薩，非不超餘，如日輪出照明世界，約喻以顯，映山出沒無隱顯故、處處全現無異體故，喻遍坐道場。	004	It only mentions bodhisattvas, not because it does not surpass the others. It is like when the sun comes out and illuminates the world. Using a metaphor to illustrate, it overshadows the mountains that appear and disappear, and it is fully present everywhere without a different essence. The metaphor is sitting pervasively in the path of enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_004:0533a26_1']	大明流空餘輝掩輝，赫日之照難究其涯，喻彼威光超映菩薩，菩薩不能測也。	大明流空餘輝掩輝，赫日之照難究其涯，喻彼威光超映菩薩，菩薩不能測也。	004	The great light flows in the void, the remaining radiance obscures the radiance, the sun's illumination is difficult to fathom its limits, comparing it to the bodhisattvas' majestic light surpassing and illuminating, the bodhisattvas cannot fathom it.
