['ZH_T38_1781_004:0961c17_14']	一不思議境、二不思議智、三不思議教。	一不思議境、二不思議智、三不思議教。	1. The inconceivable realm, 2. The inconceivable wisdom, 3. The inconceivable teaching.

Therefore, the meaning of these three gates is all-encompassing.
['ZH_T38_1781_004:0961c20_16']	言不思議境者，即是真俗二諦，然二諦未曾境。	言不思議境者，即是真俗二諦，然二諦未曾境。	As for the inconceivable realm, it is the two truths of true and conventional. However, the two truths have never been the realm.

['ZH_T38_1781_004:0961c24_7']	通而言之，此真俗二境皆是因緣假名無所得義，非是凡夫二乘有所得人所能思議，故二境名不思議。	通而言之，此真俗二境皆是因緣假名無所得義，非是凡夫二乘有所得人所能思議，故二境名不思議。	In general, these two realms of true and conventional are all the meaning of conditioned arising, provisional names, and non-attainment. They are not what ordinary beings and the two vehicles who have attained something can conceive, therefore the two realms are called inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1781_004:0961c26_11']	據別為論，真諦即諸法實相，心行處滅故意不能思、言語亦斷故口不能議，謂真諦不思議也。	據別為論，真諦即諸法實相，心行處滅故意不能思、言語亦斷故口不能議，謂真諦不思議也。	According to a separate explanation, true reality is the true aspect of all dharmas, where the mind's activity ceases, so the intention cannot contemplate it, and speech is also cut off, so the mouth cannot discuss it. This is called the inconceivable true reality.
['ZH_T38_1781_004:0961c27_18']	俗諦亦言語道斷、心行處滅，如假有不可定有，故定有心滅；	俗諦亦言語道斷、心行處滅，如假有不可定有，故定有心滅；	The conventional reality is also where the path of language is cut off and the mind's activity ceases. Like provisional existence, it cannot be definitively existent, so the mind of definitive existence ceases;

The form of the śrāvaka, bound by karmic results, although the mind is free from bonds, the body has fatigue and weariness. Therefore, he manifested the trace of wanting to stop.
['ZH_T38_1781_004:0962a16_15']	以其於弟子內年耆體劣前生念也，不欲現其累迹。	以其於弟子內年耆體劣前生念也，不欲現其累迹。	Because he was the oldest and physically weakest among the disciples, he had this thought first, not wanting to show his trace of weariness.
['ZH_T38_1781_004:0962a17_15']	又必知淨名懸鑒其心，故但心念而不發言。	又必知淨名懸鑒其心，故但心念而不發言。	Moreover, he certainly knew that Vimalakīrti would clairvoyantly perceive his thoughts, so he only had the thought in his mind and did not speak it out.
['ZH_T38_1781_004:0962a18_3']	二者就本為論。	二者就本為論。	Second, from the perspective of his essence.
['ZH_T38_1781_004:0962a19_18']	淨名與身子既是大小之人，相與化物，故淨名空室以待賓，身子念坐而發教。	淨名與身子既是大小之人，相與化物，故淨名空室以待賓，身子念坐而發教。	Since Vimalakīrti and Śāriputra were both great and small people, they mutually transformed beings. Therefore, Vimalakīrti left his room empty to await guests, while Śāriputra thought of sitting and gave rise to the teaching.

['ZH_T38_1781_004:0962b26_3']	以實相不可求則無數於外，以實智無所求則無心於內，故境智並冥、緣觀俱寂，乃為理極，真不思議也。	以實相不可求則無數於外，以實智無所求則無心於內，故境智並冥、緣觀俱寂，乃為理極，真不思議也。	Since reality cannot be sought, there are no objects outside. Since true wisdom seeks nothing, there is no mind inside. Therefore, the objective realm and wisdom are both merged, and conditions and contemplation are both quiescent. This is the ultimate principle, the true inconceivability.
