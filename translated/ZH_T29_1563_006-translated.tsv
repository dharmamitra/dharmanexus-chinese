['ZH_T29_1563_006:0800b21_19']	不信者，謂心不澄淨，邪見等流，於諸諦實靜慮等至現前輕毀，於施等因及於彼果心不現許，名為不信。	不信者，謂心不澄淨，邪見等流，於諸諦實靜慮等至現前輕毀，於施等因及於彼果心不現許，名為不信。	Lack of faith is the lack of clarity in the mind.

It is metaphorically said to be torpor, but in reality it is not torpor, because it is the object of the body consciousness.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a06_16']	且欲界中心品有五，謂善唯一；	且欲界中心品有五，謂善唯一；	In the desire realm, the category of mind is fivefold. The wholesome is only one.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a07_16']	不善有二，謂不共無明俱生及餘煩惱等俱生；	不善有二，謂不共無明俱生及餘煩惱等俱生；	The unwholesome has two: that which arises together with non-shared ignorance, and that which arises together with other afflictions, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a08_13']	無記有二，謂有覆無記及無覆無記。	無記有二，謂有覆無記及無覆無記。	The indeterminate has two: that which is indeterminate with hindrances, and that which is indeterminate without hindrances.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a11_7']	如是欲界一切心品，決定恒與尋伺相應，故善心品有二十二心所俱生，謂十大地法、十大善地法及不定二謂尋與伺。	如是欲界一切心品，決定恒與尋伺相應，故善心品有二十二心所俱生，謂十大地法、十大善地法及不定二謂尋與伺。	Thus, in all the mind categories of the desire realm, they are definitely always associated with initial and sustained thought. Therefore, the wholesome mind category has twenty-two mental factors arising together, namely the ten universal mental factors, the ten wholesome factors, and the two inconstant ones, namely initial and sustained thought.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a12_2']	此中勤、捨應不俱生，行相違故。	此中勤、捨應不俱生，行相違故。	Among them, effort and equanimity should not arise together, because their modes of activity contradict each other.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a14_1']	如契經說：	如契經說：	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a15_5']	心若惛沈，爾時應脩擇法、勤、喜，脩輕安、定、捨則為非時。	心若惛沈，爾時應脩擇法、勤、喜，脩輕安、定、捨則為非時。	If the mind is dull, then one should cultivate investigation of the Dharma, vigor, and joy, but to cultivate tranquility, concentration, and equanimity is untimely.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a18_7']	住正理者起如理行不息名勤，即於爾時棄非理行平等名捨。	住正理者起如理行不息名勤，即於爾時棄非理行平等名捨。	One who abides in correct principles generates correct practices and does not cease, which is called vigor. At that time, one abandons incorrect practices and is impartial, which is called equanimity.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a20_5']	又於如理非理行中，捨如持稱進止平等，故捨與勤更相隨順，起善止惡行不相違。	又於如理非理行中，捨如持稱進止平等，故捨與勤更相隨順，起善止惡行不相違。	Moreover, in regard to correct and incorrect practices, equanimity is like holding a scale, advancing and stopping equally. Therefore, equanimity and vigor mutually accord with each other, and the generation of good and the cessation of evil are not in opposition.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a21_4']	若於所緣一取一捨，更相違背，可有此失。	若於所緣一取一捨，更相違背，可有此失。	If one grasps one and abandons one in regard to the object, then there is this error of opposition.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a24_19']	非此二法貫通三界及六識身有漏無漏，非唯不染亦非唯染，故善心品非一切時皆有惡作，但容可有，有時增數至二十三。	非此二法貫通三界及六識身有漏無漏，非唯不染亦非唯染，故善心品非一切時皆有惡作，但容可有，有時增數至二十三。	Neither of these two dharmas penetrates the three realms and the six consciousnesses, nor is it only impure or only defiled, therefore the class of good mind is not always accompanied by remorse, but it may be present, sometimes increasing to twenty-three.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a26_3']	言惡作者，悔以惡作為所緣故立惡作名，如無相定。	言惡作者，悔以惡作為所緣故立惡作名，如無相定。	As for remorse, it is called remorse because it takes remorse as its object, like the concentration of signlessness.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a26_17']	有說，無相及身念住有處名身。	有說，無相及身念住有處名身。	Some say that signlessness and the application of mindfulness to the body are called the body in some places.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a27_15']	若爾，有緣所未作事心生追悔，應非惡作。	若爾，有緣所未作事心生追悔，應非惡作。	If so, then the mind that arises regretting something not yet done should not be remorse,
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a28_5']	不爾，未作亦名作故。	不爾，未作亦名作故。	but this is not so, because what is not yet done is also called done.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801a29_4']	我先不作如是事業，是我惡作。	我先不作如是事業，是我惡作。	I did not do such a thing before, this is my remorse.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801b01_12']	然此惡作通善不善，不通無記，隨憂行故，離欲貪者不成就故。	然此惡作通善不善，不通無記，隨憂行故，離欲貪者不成就故。	However, this remorse is both good and bad, and does not extend to the indeterminate, because it follows sorrow and because one who is free from craving for desire does not accomplish it.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0801b02_7']	非無記法有如是事，然有追變。	非無記法有如是事，然有追變。	Indeterminate dharmas do not have such things, but there is regret.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0803c17_3']	未得非得說名不獲，已失非得名不成就，故說異生性名不獲聖法。	未得非得說名不獲，已失非得名不成就，故說異生性名不獲聖法。	Nonacquisition of what has not yet been acquired is called nonobtainment. Loss of what has already been acquired is called nonaccomplishment. Therefore it is said that the nature of an ordinary person is called nonobtainment of the holy dharmas.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0803c23_10']	謂現在者，唯於現在有自在力，非於過未。	謂現在者，唯於現在有自在力，非於過未。	That is, that which is present has mastery over the present, not over the past or future.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0803c25_8']	如轉輪王於現七寶有自在力，隨意受用增上果故、恒現前故，隨樂而轉可名成就。	如轉輪王於現七寶有自在力，隨意受用增上果故、恒現前故，隨樂而轉可名成就。	For example, a wheel-turning king has mastery over the seven jewels in the present, because he freely enjoys the dominant fruit and because they are always present before him. He can be said to accomplish them because he turns them to his own use as he wishes.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0804a02_16']	若謂有力當能生彼名成就者，理亦不然，後有異生應名聖者，後心無學應是異生，如是等類有眾多失，故得非得定有別體。	若謂有力當能生彼名成就者，理亦不然，後有異生應名聖者，後心無學應是異生，如是等類有眾多失，故得非得定有別體。	If it is said that one is called possessing them because one has the power to produce them, this is also unreasonable. Later ordinary beings would be called noble ones, and the final mind of an arhat would be an ordinary being. There are many such errors. Therefore possession and non-possession definitely have separate substances.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0804a05_4']	有為唯在自蘊非餘，無為法中唯於二滅有得非得，一切有情無不成就非擇滅者，故對法中有如是說：	有為唯在自蘊非餘，無為法中唯於二滅有得非得，一切有情無不成就非擇滅者，故對法中有如是說：	Conditioned dharmas are only in one's own aggregates, not in others. Among unconditioned dharmas, only the two cessations have possession and non-possession. No sentient being does not accomplish non-analytical cessation. Therefore the Abhidharma has this explanation:

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0804a08_3']	決定無有成就虛空，以於虛空無有得故。	決定無有成就虛空，以於虛空無有得故。	There is definitely no one who is provided with space, because there is no attainment of space.
['ZH_T29_1563_006:0804a08_15']	亦無不成就，以無非得故。	亦無不成就，以無非得故。	Nor is there anyone who is not provided with space, because there is no nonattainment.

['ZH_T29_1563_006:0804a16_11']	若體別有，體即是得，但立異名。	若體別有，體即是得，但立異名。	If they exist separately, they are the same as the nature of possession and are merely given a different name.
