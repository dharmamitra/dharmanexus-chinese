This is all because in the ten grounds one accumulates virtues and accomplishes success, and in the eleventh ground the practices of benefiting sentient beings are fulfilled, only then is one called a Buddha of Perfect Dharma Practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c04_15']	於始於終，無作體性不移毫念，為以法界圓明大智之性為十住見道之初，無時念故、三世無性故、總一時故，此非情識所知，唯智會故。	於始於終，無作體性不移毫念，為以法界圓明大智之性為十住見道之初，無時念故、三世無性故、總一時故，此非情識所知，唯智會故。	008	From beginning to end, the nature of non-action does not move a single thought, using the nature of the perfect and bright great wisdom of the Dharma realm as the beginning of seeing the path of the ten abodes, because there is no time or thought, because the three times have no nature, and because they are all one time. This is not known by the conscious mind, but only by wisdom.

They all expediently manifest their bodies from the realm of great wisdom in the ocean of nature, provisionally establishing the stages of the ten faiths, ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and the stage of equal enlightenment, in order to enable ordinary beings to enter and emulate them, and not be confused by the traces.

As the wisdom becomes higher, the practices become lower. Because the practices are fulfilled according to the capacities, it is called progressive cultivation.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c15_1']	隨力堪能安立諸位，隨位知行令不迷因果，使學者善明總別、依跡成功，不滯始故、不離初故。	隨力堪能安立諸位，隨位知行令不迷因果，使學者善明總別、依跡成功，不滯始故、不離初故。	008	The stages are established according to one's ability and capacity, and the practices of each stage are understood to avoid confusion between cause and effect.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c24_10']	以此〈法界〉一品是一切諸佛及以一切眾生之果也。	以此〈法界〉一品是一切諸佛及以一切眾生之果也。	008	This chapter on the Dharma realm is the fruition of all buddhas and all sentient beings.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a02_24']	三定體遍周，即〈十定〉、〈十通〉、〈十忍〉等品是。	三定體遍周，即〈十定〉、〈十通〉、〈十忍〉等品是。	008	Third, the essence of samādhi pervades everywhere, which is the chapters on the ten samādhis, ten spiritual powers, ten forbearances, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a03_21']	四行海遍周，即〈普賢行品〉、〈離世間品〉是。	四行海遍周，即〈普賢行品〉、〈離世間品〉是。	008	Fourth, the ocean of practices pervades everywhere, which is the chapter on Samantabhadra's practices and the chapter on Leaving the World.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a05_19']	有此五遍周義故，以此一部之經有五品。	有此五遍周義故，以此一部之經有五品。	008	Because there are these five meanings of pervasiveness, this one part of the sūtra has five chapters.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a09_7']	五品之內，品初皆有「爾時世尊在摩竭提國以為品首」者，明此五法是一時、一法界、一剎那際、一體用，一切諸佛共同之法、一因果，等周圓滿無前後義。	五品之內，品初皆有「爾時世尊在摩竭提國以為品首」者，明此五法是一時、一法界、一剎那際、一體用，一切諸佛共同之法、一因果，等周圓滿無前後義。	008	Within the five categories, the beginning of each category has At that time, the World-Honored One was in the country of Magadha, which became the beginning of the category. This clarifies that these five dharmas are of one time, one dharma realm, one instant, one essence and function, the common dharma of all Buddhas, and one cause and effect, equally perfect and complete without any before or after.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a09_15']	一切諸佛皆如是。	一切諸佛皆如是。	008	All Buddhas are like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a11_18']	如是之法，不離十定之中一剎那際，降神入胎、示現成佛、入涅槃，不離一剎那際，更無移也。	如是之法，不離十定之中一剎那際，降神入胎、示現成佛、入涅槃，不離一剎那際，更無移也。	008	Such dharmas are not apart from one instant within the ten samādhis, manifesting birth in the womb, demonstrating the attainment of Buddhahood, and entering nirvāṇa, all not apart from one instant, without any change.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a14_16']	以此一部之典，五度一箇「爾時世尊在摩竭提國」，唯〈法界品〉別，總明此一部之經大體宗趣一法界大圓明智，有此五種遍周之因果。	以此一部之典，五度一箇「爾時世尊在摩竭提國」，唯〈法界品〉別，總明此一部之經大體宗趣一法界大圓明智，有此五種遍周之因果。	008	Using this entire canon, the five times At that time, the World-Honored One was in the country of Magadha, only the Dharma Realm chapter is different. In general, this entire sūtra clarifies the great essence and purport of one dharma realm, the great perfect and bright wisdom, which has these five kinds of all-pervading cause and effect.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a16_19']	從初信心進修諸行，始終因果行圓滿，畢竟不出十定之體、無時之性，凡聖總齊，本來如是。	從初信心進修諸行，始終因果行圓滿，畢竟不出十定之體、無時之性，凡聖總齊，本來如是。	008	From the initial stage of faith, progressing to cultivate all practices, from beginning to end, the causes and effects are perfectly fulfilled, ultimately not departing from the essence of the ten samādhis, the nature of timelessness. All sentient beings are equal, originally like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a17_16']	由情妄繫時量隨生，由妄繫故生老便有。	由情妄繫時量隨生，由妄繫故生老便有。	008	Due to the bondage of deluded emotions, time and measure arise accordingly. Due to bondage, birth and old age come to be.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a19_3']	若於根本法界門中起延促見，皆是自情妄見，非實有故。	若於根本法界門中起延促見，皆是自情妄見，非實有故。	008	If one gives rise to the view of extension and contraction within the Dharma realm of the fundamental truth, they are all one's own deluded emotions and views, not truly existent.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a21_4']	如是迷無性理，違本無時智境之法門，逐情隨妄見時劫延促者，於佛正法之中不成信種。	如是迷無性理，違本無時智境之法門，逐情隨妄見時劫延促者，於佛正法之中不成信種。	008	Thus, those who are confused about the principle of naturelessness, go against the Dharma gate of the wisdom realm of the originally timeless truth, and follow their emotions and deluded views to extend or contract time and eons, within the true Dharma of the Buddha, do not give rise to the seeds of faith.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a23_1']	當知是人設修行出三界果，未有成佛之種故，即權教六通菩薩、聲聞、緣覺是也。	當知是人設修行出三界果，未有成佛之種故，即權教六通菩薩、聲聞、緣覺是也。	008	One should know that even if such people cultivate and attain the fruits of leaving the three realms, they do not have the seeds of becoming a Buddha, and are thus the bodhisattvas of the provisional teachings with the six spiritual powers, as well as the hearers and solitary realizers.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a23_19']	如《法華經》不退諸菩薩，亦復不能知。	如《法華經》不退諸菩薩，亦復不能知。	008	As the Lotus Sutra says, even the irreversible bodhisattvas cannot know this.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a24_15']	此明出生死之不退，未成處生死中不退。	此明出生死之不退，未成處生死中不退。	008	This clarifies the non-retrogression of escaping from birth and death, not yet attaining non-retrogression while dwelling in birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a26_13']	又但得以空觀折伏現行煩惱入初地見道位，非是以達根本無明得根本智中不退。	又但得以空觀折伏現行煩惱入初地見道位，非是以達根本無明得根本智中不退。	008	Moreover, one can only use the emptiness contemplation to subdue the presently active afflictions and enter the initial ground of the path of seeing, not yet attaining the non-retrogression of the fundamental ignorance and attaining the fundamental wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a29_1']	如是三乘見道，總是三種意生身菩薩，皆非是根本法界大圓明智初發心住中能十方成佛等不退。	如是三乘見道，總是三種意生身菩薩，皆非是根本法界大圓明智初發心住中能十方成佛等不退。	008	Thus, the path of seeing of the three vehicles is all the bodhisattvas with the three kinds of intention-born bodies, none of whom have attained the non-retrogression of the initial ground of abiding in the great perfect mirror-like wisdom of the fundamental Dharma realm, such as being able to attain Buddhahood in the ten directions.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b02_13']	三種意生身者，初二三地名三摩跋提樂意生身，四五六地名覺法自性意生身，七八九十地名種類俱生無行意生身。	三種意生身者，初二三地名三摩跋提樂意生身，四五六地名覺法自性意生身，七八九十地名種類俱生無行意生身。	008	The three kinds of intention-born bodies are: the first two to three grounds are called the body born of concentration and joy, the fourth to sixth grounds are called the body born of the realization of the nature of phenomena, and the seventh to tenth grounds are called the body born of the spontaneous arising of various kinds.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b04_17']	如是三種意生身菩薩，並是法界大圓明智海，火宅門外三車權方便安立，令諸子等且免火難。	如是三種意生身菩薩，並是法界大圓明智海，火宅門外三車權方便安立，令諸子等且免火難。	008	These three kinds of bodhisattvas with intention-born bodies are all the expedient means of establishing the three vehicles outside the gate of the burning house of the great perfect mirror-like wisdom ocean of the Dharma realm, in order to enable the children to temporarily escape the calamity of the fire.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b05_11']	如此經下文「聲聞在會如聾。	如此經下文「聲聞在會如聾。	008	As the text below says, The śrāvakas in the assembly are like the deaf.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b06_12']	」如經具明。	」如經具明。	008	As the sūtra clearly explains.

It is the wondrous canon of the One Vehicle, the principle of the Dharma realm, which causes beings with great minds to enter the fundamental wisdom of the Buddha and the fruition of Buddhahood. Because in a single thought, in accord with true reality, wisdom manifests, and one immediately becomes a Buddha.

It differs from those of inferior understanding in the Three Vehicles, who are suitable to hear of attaining Buddhahood after three incalculably long eons. It is suitable to speak of Śākyamuni's Pure Land being in another direction, and this Sahā world being a defiled land.

This sūtra does not allow sentient beings to know and understand the provisional teachings of the nirmāṇakāya Buddha of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c18_6']	化佛教中菩薩及二乘之眾不能解了一真法界報佛法門，唯知三乘自分法故。	化佛教中菩薩及二乘之眾不能解了一真法界報佛法門，唯知三乘自分法故。	008	In the teachings of the nirmāṇakāya Buddha, bodhisattvas and the assemblies of the two vehicles are unable to understand the Dharma gate of the nirmāṇakāya Buddha of the one true Dharma realm. They only know the Dharma of the three vehicles for themselves.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c20_16']	設是菩薩，但知三千大千世界為一報佛境界故，千百億釋迦是化身故，不解此一乘實報法界報佛所說法門故。	設是菩薩，但知三千大千世界為一報佛境界故，千百億釋迦是化身故，不解此一乘實報法界報佛所說法門故。	008	If it is a bodhisattva, they only know that the trichiliocosm is a single retribution Buddha realm, and the thousand billion Śākyas are transformation bodies, and do not understand that this One Vehicle is the Dharma realm of true retribution, the Dharma door spoken by the retribution Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c22_17']	是故此經還名毘盧遮那法界，佛果智海所收，非同三乘菩薩化佛教中權施菩薩藏所攝。	是故此經還名毘盧遮那法界，佛果智海所收，非同三乘菩薩化佛教中權施菩薩藏所攝。	008	Therefore, this sūtra is still named the Dharma realm of Vairocana, included in the wisdom ocean of the Buddha's fruition, not the same as being included in the bodhisattva canon provisionally taught in the sūtras of the bodhisattva transformation Buddhas of the Three Vehicles.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c26_3']	是故下文〈法界品〉中，慈氏所居樓閣名毘盧遮那莊嚴藏，善財入已，唯見無量諸佛法藏行門報相莊嚴無盡福相皆阿僧祇，一一具如經說。	是故下文〈法界品〉中，慈氏所居樓閣名毘盧遮那莊嚴藏，善財入已，唯見無量諸佛法藏行門報相莊嚴無盡福相皆阿僧祇，一一具如經說。	008	Therefore, in the chapter on the Dharma realm below, the pavilion where Maitreya resides is named the treasury of adornments of Vairocana. As soon as Sudhana enters, he only sees the boundless marks of the practices and appearances of the Dharma treasury of the Buddhas, the adornments of boundless merit, all asaṃkhyeya in number, each one as described in the sūtra.

It is accomplished by the causes and effects of practicing the Dharma realm treasury, and so on, up to the causes and effects of the adornments of the buddhas' karmic retribution being the same.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a08_4']	是故此經是毘盧遮那藏所收，非三乘菩薩藏所攝故。	是故此經是毘盧遮那藏所收，非三乘菩薩藏所攝故。	008	Therefore, this sūtra is included in the Vairocana canon, not in the canon of the bodhisattvas of the three vehicles.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a10_8']	修差別智故，若異佛古跡而有進修，無成佛義。	修差別智故，若異佛古跡而有進修，無成佛義。	008	Because one cultivates the wisdom of distinctions, if one practices and progresses in a way that differs from the Buddha's ancient site, there is no meaning of attaining Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a11_15']	如三乘，且免一分麁生死苦，非是依佛智體古跡契修佛乘也。	如三乘，且免一分麁生死苦，非是依佛智體古跡契修佛乘也。	008	Like the three vehicles, one may temporarily avoid the suffering of coarse birth and death, but this is not relying on the Buddha's wisdom body to accord with the practice of the Buddha vehicle.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a23_12']	次第二會中，又「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺」，明不移本處而至報宅中居，為普光明殿，明理智之行報得之宅，寄同世間蘭若契證方詣宅居。	次第二會中，又「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺」，明不移本處而至報宅中居，為普光明殿，明理智之行報得之宅，寄同世間蘭若契證方詣宅居。	008	Next, in the second assembly, it again says, At that time, the World-Honored One was in the country of Magadha, in the forest of Dharma and Bodhimanda, having just attained perfect enlightenment, clarifying that without leaving the original place, he arrived at the house of retribution, which is the Hall of Universal Radiance, clarifying the house of retribution obtained through the practice of wisdom and principle. It is provisionally the same as the forest in the world, and only after the realization of the truth can one go to the house.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a25_9']	自此以去上昇天宮，皆云「不離本處而身遍坐一切道場」，或云「而昇如是天」。	自此以去上昇天宮，皆云「不離本處而身遍坐一切道場」，或云「而昇如是天」。	008	From here on, ascending to the heavenly palaces, it all says without leaving the original place, the body universally sits in all enlightenment sites, or it says and ascends to such-and-such heavens.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a25_20']	上昇天者，明列位進修。	上昇天者，明列位進修。	008	Ascending to the heavens clarifies the stages of advancing practice.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a27_11']	不移本處者，明法界道理，以法性妙理無往來內外故、大智體自遍周故。	不移本處者，明法界道理，以法性妙理無往來內外故、大智體自遍周故。	008	Not moving from the original place clarifies the principle of the Dharma realm, because the wondrous principle of the Dharma nature has no coming or going, no inside or outside, and because the essence of great wisdom is universally pervasive.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b01_18']	次四十卷中，〈十定品〉又云「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺，於普光明殿入剎那際三昧」，明以法界法身為定體，無三世性故。	次四十卷中，〈十定品〉又云「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺，於普光明殿入剎那際三昧」，明以法界法身為定體，無三世性故。	008	Next, in the forty scrolls, the Chapter on Ten Concentrations also says, At that time, the World-Honored One, in the country of Magadha, in the enlightenment site of the Dharma of the solitary place, having just attained perfect enlightenment, entered the samādhi of the instant of a thought in the Hall of Universal Radiance, clarifying that the Dharma realm and Dharma body are the essence of concentration, because they have no nature of the three times.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b04_5']	從兜率天下、降神及入涅槃，四十年住世，轉一切法輪，總不出剎那際，以此三昧圓通始終非三世古今故。	從兜率天下、降神及入涅槃，四十年住世，轉一切法輪，總不出剎那際，以此三昧圓通始終非三世古今故。	008	From descending from Tuṣita Heaven, manifesting birth, and entering nirvāṇa, to dwelling in the world for forty years and turning the wheel of the Dharma of all teachings, it is all not beyond the instant of a thought, because this samādhi is perfect and unobstructed, and its beginning and end are not of the three times or ancient and modern.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b06_14']	如是序致，以總言之，一切過現未來諸佛皆盡一時成佛，并眾生生死亦不移剎那，但眾生妄繫有年歲長短。	如是序致，以總言之，一切過現未來諸佛皆盡一時成佛，并眾生生死亦不移剎那，但眾生妄繫有年歲長短。	008	In this way, in general, all Buddhas of the past, present, and future attain Buddhahood at the same time, and the birth and death of sentient beings also do not move for a moment, but sentient beings are deludedly bound by the passage of years.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b07_8']	如佛所說，即生即死皆不移時。	如佛所說，即生即死皆不移時。	008	As the Buddha said, birth and death do not move at different times.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b09_6']	是故經云「一念普觀無量劫，無去無來亦無住，如是遍知三世事，超諸方便成十力。	是故經云「一念普觀無量劫，無去無來亦無住，如是遍知三世事，超諸方便成十力。	008	Therefore, the sutra says, In a single thought, one universally observes immeasurable eons, without going, coming, or abiding. In this way, one thoroughly knows the events of the three times and transcends all expedient means to accomplish the ten powers.

Therefore, it is explained using the name of samādhi.

For this reason, the Tathāgata himself explains, clarifying the ultimate limit of counting and calculation from the beginning to the end of the fruition.

The very last chapter, Entering the Dharma Realm, is explained through the Tathāgata's spiritual power, illustrating that within the Dharma realm, all dharmas are universally spiritual, universally true, and universally inconceivable. It clarifies that the essence of the Dharma realm is the single nature of ordinary beings and sages, and is therefore explained among humans.
