This is not known by the conscious mind, but only by wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c09_11']	九明諸賢寄位者，即已上三十七品諸菩薩并佛是，〈出現世間品〉亦是，皆從性海大智境界中方便出現其身，寄位成十信、十住、十行、十迴向、十地及等覺位十一地法門，令凡夫信入倣學，依跡不迷其事。	九明諸賢寄位者，即已上三十七品諸菩薩并佛是，〈出現世間品〉亦是，皆從性海大智境界中方便出現其身，寄位成十信、十住、十行、十迴向、十地及等覺位十一地法門，令凡夫信入倣學，依跡不迷其事。	The ninth is the provisional stages of the sages, which are the thirty-seven bodhisattvas above, as well as the chapter on appearing in the world. They all expediently manifest their bodies from the realm of great wisdom in the ocean of nature, provisionally establishing the stages of the ten faiths, ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and the stage of equal enlightenment, in order to enable ordinary beings to enter and emulate them, and not be confused by the traces.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c11_8']	十明令凡實證者，以法界性中安立十信等六位，進修方便行。	十明令凡實證者，以法界性中安立十信等六位，進修方便行。	The tenth is to enable ordinary beings to truly realize, by establishing the six stages such as the ten faiths within the nature of the Dharma realm, and practicing the expedient practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c12_18']	十地不離體用、不壞方便，其智彌高、其行彌下，逐根行滿故名進修。	十地不離體用、不壞方便，其智彌高、其行彌下，逐根行滿故名進修。	The ten grounds are inseparable from essence and function, and the expedient means are not destroyed. As the wisdom becomes higher, the practices become lower. Because the practices are fulfilled according to the capacities, it is called progressive cultivation.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c15_1']	隨力堪能安立諸位，隨位知行令不迷因果，使學者善明總別、依跡成功，不滯始故、不離初故。	隨力堪能安立諸位，隨位知行令不迷因果，使學者善明總別、依跡成功，不滯始故、不離初故。	The stages are established according to one's ability and capacity, and the practices of each stage are understood to avoid confusion between cause and effect.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c17_16']	即如下文，善財等眾優婆塞、優婆夷、童子、童女各列有五百，具明十住、十行、十迴向、十地、十一地五位，一位有十通為五百。	即如下文，善財等眾優婆塞、優婆夷、童子、童女各列有五百，具明十住、十行、十迴向、十地、十一地五位，一位有十通為五百。	It is as the text below states, with the assembly of good sons, upāsakas, upāsikās, youths, and maidens each listed as five hundred, clearly explaining the ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and eleventh ground of the five positions, with ten in each position totaling five hundred.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c18_13']	如六千比丘，通信亦不退，總云六千。	如六千比丘，通信亦不退，總云六千。	Like the six thousand bhikṣus, it communicates that they are also irreversible, generally saying six thousand.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c19_2']	一萬諸龍，以明萬行。	一萬諸龍，以明萬行。	The ten thousand dragons clarify the myriad practices.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c23_7']	如〈法界〉一品總通前後四十品經，總法界故，明三世法總法界故。	如〈法界〉一品總通前後四十品經，總法界故，明三世法總法界故。	Like the chapter on the Dharma realm, it generally applies to the forty chapters before and after, because it is the Dharma realm, clarifying that the dharmas of the three times are generally the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c24_10']	以此〈法界〉一品是一切諸佛及以一切眾生之果也。	以此〈法界〉一品是一切諸佛及以一切眾生之果也。	This chapter on the Dharma realm is the fruition of all buddhas and all sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0766c25_8']	於此一部之經，總有五種因果遍周義。	於此一部之經，總有五種因果遍周義。	Within this one part of the sūtra, there are five kinds of causes and effects that pervade everywhere.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a01_3']	二信位及進修因果遍周，從〈佛名號品〉已下六品經，通十住、十行、十迴向、十地位中，共十品經是。	二信位及進修因果遍周，從〈佛名號品〉已下六品經，通十住、十行、十迴向、十地位中，共十品經是。	Second, the cause and effect of the stage of faith and the practice of progress pervades everywhere, from the chapter on the Buddha's Names onward, in the six chapters of the sūtra, which are in the ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, and ten grounds, with ten chapters in total.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a02_24']	三定體遍周，即〈十定〉、〈十通〉、〈十忍〉等品是。	三定體遍周，即〈十定〉、〈十通〉、〈十忍〉等品是。	Third, the essence of samādhi pervades everywhere, which is the chapters on the ten samādhis, ten spiritual powers, ten forbearances, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a03_21']	四行海遍周，即〈普賢行品〉、〈離世間品〉是。	四行海遍周，即〈普賢行品〉、〈離世間品〉是。	Fourth, the ocean of practices pervades everywhere, which is the chapter on Samantabhadra's practices and the chapter on Leaving the World.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a05_1']	五法界不思議大圓明智海遍周，即〈法界品〉是。	五法界不思議大圓明智海遍周，即〈法界品〉是。	Fifth, the inconceivable great ocean of wisdom of the Dharma realm pervades everywhere, which is the chapter on the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a05_19']	有此五遍周義故，以此一部之經有五品。	有此五遍周義故，以此一部之經有五品。	Because there are these five meanings of pervasiveness, this one part of the sūtra has five chapters.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a09_7']	五品之內，品初皆有「爾時世尊在摩竭提國以為品首」者，明此五法是一時、一法界、一剎那際、一體用，一切諸佛共同之法、一因果，等周圓滿無前後義。	五品之內，品初皆有「爾時世尊在摩竭提國以為品首」者，明此五法是一時、一法界、一剎那際、一體用，一切諸佛共同之法、一因果，等周圓滿無前後義。	Within the five categories, the beginning of each category has At that time, the World-Honored One was in the country of Magadha, which became the beginning of the category. This clarifies that these five dharmas are of one time, one dharma realm, one instant, one essence and function, the common dharma of all Buddhas, and one cause and effect, equally perfect and complete without any before or after.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a09_15']	一切諸佛皆如是。	一切諸佛皆如是。	All Buddhas are like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a11_18']	如是之法，不離十定之中一剎那際，降神入胎、示現成佛、入涅槃，不離一剎那際，更無移也。	如是之法，不離十定之中一剎那際，降神入胎、示現成佛、入涅槃，不離一剎那際，更無移也。	Such dharmas are not apart from one instant within the ten samādhis, manifesting birth in the womb, demonstrating the attainment of Buddhahood, and entering nirvāṇa, all not apart from one instant, without any change.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a14_16']	以此一部之典，五度一箇「爾時世尊在摩竭提國」，唯〈法界品〉別，總明此一部之經大體宗趣一法界大圓明智，有此五種遍周之因果。	以此一部之典，五度一箇「爾時世尊在摩竭提國」，唯〈法界品〉別，總明此一部之經大體宗趣一法界大圓明智，有此五種遍周之因果。	Using this entire canon, the five times At that time, the World-Honored One was in the country of Magadha, only the Dharma Realm chapter is different. In general, this entire sūtra clarifies the great essence and purport of one dharma realm, the great perfect and bright wisdom, which has these five kinds of all-pervading cause and effect.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a16_19']	從初信心進修諸行，始終因果行圓滿，畢竟不出十定之體、無時之性，凡聖總齊，本來如是。	從初信心進修諸行，始終因果行圓滿，畢竟不出十定之體、無時之性，凡聖總齊，本來如是。	From the initial stage of faith, progressing to cultivate all practices, from beginning to end, the causes and effects are perfectly fulfilled, ultimately not departing from the essence of the ten samādhis, the nature of timelessness. All sentient beings are equal, originally like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a17_16']	由情妄繫時量隨生，由妄繫故生老便有。	由情妄繫時量隨生，由妄繫故生老便有。	Due to the bondage of deluded emotions, time and measure arise accordingly. Due to bondage, birth and old age come to be.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a19_3']	若於根本法界門中起延促見，皆是自情妄見，非實有故。	若於根本法界門中起延促見，皆是自情妄見，非實有故。	If one gives rise to the view of extension and contraction within the Dharma realm of the fundamental truth, they are all one's own deluded emotions and views, not truly existent.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a21_4']	如是迷無性理，違本無時智境之法門，逐情隨妄見時劫延促者，於佛正法之中不成信種。	如是迷無性理，違本無時智境之法門，逐情隨妄見時劫延促者，於佛正法之中不成信種。	Thus, those who are confused about the principle of naturelessness, go against the Dharma gate of the wisdom realm of the originally timeless truth, and follow their emotions and deluded views to extend or contract time and eons, within the true Dharma of the Buddha, do not give rise to the seeds of faith.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a23_1']	當知是人設修行出三界果，未有成佛之種故，即權教六通菩薩、聲聞、緣覺是也。	當知是人設修行出三界果，未有成佛之種故，即權教六通菩薩、聲聞、緣覺是也。	One should know that even if such people cultivate and attain the fruits of leaving the three realms, they do not have the seeds of becoming a Buddha, and are thus the bodhisattvas of the provisional teachings with the six spiritual powers, as well as the hearers and solitary realizers.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a23_19']	如《法華經》不退諸菩薩，亦復不能知。	如《法華經》不退諸菩薩，亦復不能知。	As the Lotus Sutra says, even the irreversible bodhisattvas cannot know this.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a24_15']	此明出生死之不退，未成處生死中不退。	此明出生死之不退，未成處生死中不退。	This clarifies the non-retrogression of escaping from birth and death, not yet attaining non-retrogression while dwelling in birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a26_13']	又但得以空觀折伏現行煩惱入初地見道位，非是以達根本無明得根本智中不退。	又但得以空觀折伏現行煩惱入初地見道位，非是以達根本無明得根本智中不退。	Moreover, one can only use the emptiness contemplation to subdue the presently active afflictions and enter the initial ground of the path of seeing, not yet attaining the non-retrogression of the fundamental ignorance and attaining the fundamental wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767a29_1']	如是三乘見道，總是三種意生身菩薩，皆非是根本法界大圓明智初發心住中能十方成佛等不退。	如是三乘見道，總是三種意生身菩薩，皆非是根本法界大圓明智初發心住中能十方成佛等不退。	Thus, the path of seeing of the three vehicles is all the bodhisattvas with the three kinds of intention-born bodies, none of whom have attained the non-retrogression of the initial ground of abiding in the great perfect mirror-like wisdom of the fundamental Dharma realm, such as being able to attain Buddhahood in the ten directions.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b02_13']	三種意生身者，初二三地名三摩跋提樂意生身，四五六地名覺法自性意生身，七八九十地名種類俱生無行意生身。	三種意生身者，初二三地名三摩跋提樂意生身，四五六地名覺法自性意生身，七八九十地名種類俱生無行意生身。	The three kinds of intention-born bodies are: the first two to three grounds are called the body born of concentration and joy, the fourth to sixth grounds are called the body born of the realization of the nature of phenomena, and the seventh to tenth grounds are called the body born of the spontaneous arising of various kinds.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b04_17']	如是三種意生身菩薩，並是法界大圓明智海，火宅門外三車權方便安立，令諸子等且免火難。	如是三種意生身菩薩，並是法界大圓明智海，火宅門外三車權方便安立，令諸子等且免火難。	These three kinds of bodhisattvas with intention-born bodies are all the expedient means of establishing the three vehicles outside the gate of the burning house of the great perfect mirror-like wisdom ocean of the Dharma realm, in order to enable the children to temporarily escape the calamity of the fire.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b05_11']	如此經下文「聲聞在會如聾。	如此經下文「聲聞在會如聾。	As the text below says, The śrāvakas in the assembly are like the deaf.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b06_6']	六通菩薩，設聞此經，不能生信。	六通菩薩，設聞此經，不能生信。	Even if the bodhisattvas with the six spiritual powers hear this sūtra, they cannot give rise to faith.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b06_12']	」如經具明。	」如經具明。	As the sūtra clearly explains.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0767b08_7']	為從無始際，設能於佛法生信，但隨情生信，迷自智境故，無自契實智起真信修故。	為從無始際，設能於佛法生信，但隨情生信，迷自智境故，無自契實智起真信修故。	From beginningless time, even if they are able to give rise to faith in the Buddha's teachings, they only give rise to faith according to their emotions, and are confused about their own wisdom realm, so they do not accord with true wisdom and give rise to true faith and practice.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768b17_5']	若心外有佛，不名信心，名為邪見人也。	若心外有佛，不名信心，名為邪見人也。	If there is a Buddha outside the mind, it is not called the mind of faith, but the view of a heretic.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768b18_19']	一切諸佛皆同自心，一切眾生皆同自性，性無依故，體無差別，智慧一性。	一切諸佛皆同自心，一切眾生皆同自性，性無依故，體無差別，智慧一性。	All Buddhas are the same as one's own mind, and all sentient beings are the same as one's own nature. Since nature is without reliance, the essence is without distinction, and wisdom is of one nature.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768b23_11']	是故此經宗趣，為大心眾生設如斯法，諸佛自所乘門一乘妙典法界道理，令大心眾生入佛根本智佛果故，一念契真理智同現即便佛故。	是故此經宗趣，為大心眾生設如斯法，諸佛自所乘門一乘妙典法界道理，令大心眾生入佛根本智佛果故，一念契真理智同現即便佛故。	Therefore, the purport of this sūtra is to set forth this Dharma for beings with great minds. It is the wondrous canon of the One Vehicle, the principle of the Dharma realm, which causes beings with great minds to enter the fundamental wisdom of the Buddha and the fruition of Buddhahood. Because in a single thought, in accord with true reality, wisdom manifests, and one immediately becomes a Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768b26_5']	為法界道理，見則無初中後故，異彼三乘劣解者，宜聞三無數劫登佛果故，宜說釋迦淨土在於他方、此娑婆是穢土故。	為法界道理，見則無初中後故，異彼三乘劣解者，宜聞三無數劫登佛果故，宜說釋迦淨土在於他方、此娑婆是穢土故。	It is the principle of the Dharma realm, which, when seen, has no beginning, middle, or end. It differs from those of inferior understanding in the Three Vehicles, who are suitable to hear of attaining Buddhahood after three incalculably long eons. It is suitable to speak of Śākyamuni's Pure Land being in another direction, and this Sahā world being a defiled land.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768b28_16']	是故《法華經》內為迴三乘劣解者，令龍女非器剎那成佛，明信心廣大，非權施設，現實教故，所修實教不迂滯故。	是故《法華經》內為迴三乘劣解者，令龍女非器剎那成佛，明信心廣大，非權施設，現實教故，所修實教不迂滯故。	Therefore, within the Lotus Sūtra, for the sake of those of inferior understanding in the Three Vehicles, it is said that the dragon girl, who is not a suitable vessel, attains Buddhahood in an instant. It clarifies that the mind of faith is vast, not a provisional arrangement, and is truly the teaching in reality, and the practice cultivated is not roundabout or obstructed.

In a single thought, one responds to the truth and exhausts the emotions of the three times. Wisdom is without arising or submerging, and is thus the fruition of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c04_9']	是故經云「為度劣解眾生，興八相等事。	是故經云「為度劣解眾生，興八相等事。	Therefore, the sūtra says, In order to deliver sentient beings with inferior understanding, [the Buddha] manifests the events of the eight appearances, etc.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c06_10']	南方者，為明、為正，以主离故。	南方者，為明、為正，以主离故。	The south is used to clarify and to represent, because it is the lord of the li trigram.

This sūtra does not allow sentient beings to know and understand the provisional teachings of the nirmāṇakāya Buddha of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c18_6']	化佛教中菩薩及二乘之眾不能解了一真法界報佛法門，唯知三乘自分法故。	化佛教中菩薩及二乘之眾不能解了一真法界報佛法門，唯知三乘自分法故。	In the teachings of the nirmāṇakāya Buddha, bodhisattvas and the assemblies of the two vehicles are unable to understand the Dharma gate of the nirmāṇakāya Buddha of the one true Dharma realm. They only know the Dharma of the three vehicles for themselves.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c20_16']	設是菩薩，但知三千大千世界為一報佛境界故，千百億釋迦是化身故，不解此一乘實報法界報佛所說法門故。	設是菩薩，但知三千大千世界為一報佛境界故，千百億釋迦是化身故，不解此一乘實報法界報佛所說法門故。	If it is a bodhisattva, they only know that the trichiliocosm is a single retribution Buddha realm, and the thousand billion Śākyas are transformation bodies, and do not understand that this One Vehicle is the Dharma realm of true retribution, the Dharma door spoken by the retribution Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c22_17']	是故此經還名毘盧遮那法界，佛果智海所收，非同三乘菩薩化佛教中權施菩薩藏所攝。	是故此經還名毘盧遮那法界，佛果智海所收，非同三乘菩薩化佛教中權施菩薩藏所攝。	Therefore, this sūtra is still named the Dharma realm of Vairocana, included in the wisdom ocean of the Buddha's fruition, not the same as being included in the bodhisattva canon provisionally taught in the sūtras of the bodhisattva transformation Buddhas of the Three Vehicles.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c26_3']	是故下文〈法界品〉中，慈氏所居樓閣名毘盧遮那莊嚴藏，善財入已，唯見無量諸佛法藏行門報相莊嚴無盡福相皆阿僧祇，一一具如經說。	是故下文〈法界品〉中，慈氏所居樓閣名毘盧遮那莊嚴藏，善財入已，唯見無量諸佛法藏行門報相莊嚴無盡福相皆阿僧祇，一一具如經說。	Therefore, in the chapter on the Dharma realm below, the pavilion where Maitreya resides is named the treasury of adornments of Vairocana. As soon as Sudhana enters, he only sees the boundless marks of the practices and appearances of the Dharma treasury of the Buddhas, the adornments of boundless merit, all asaṃkhyeya in number, each one as described in the sūtra.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0768c28_18']	此即依毘盧遮那佛所教法行，法行之因報得所居宮殿樓閣，一依法界藏行所成因果故，乃至諸佛報得莊嚴因果亦如之故。	此即依毘盧遮那佛所教法行，法行之因報得所居宮殿樓閣，一依法界藏行所成因果故，乃至諸佛報得莊嚴因果亦如之故。	This is the palace and pavilion that one dwells in as the karmic retribution of practicing the Dharma according to the teachings of Vairocana Buddha. It is accomplished by the causes and effects of practicing the Dharma realm treasury, and so on, up to the causes and effects of the adornments of the buddhas' karmic retribution being the same.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a11_15']	如三乘，且免一分麁生死苦，非是依佛智體古跡契修佛乘也。	如三乘，且免一分麁生死苦，非是依佛智體古跡契修佛乘也。	Like the three vehicles, one may temporarily avoid the suffering of coarse birth and death, but this is not relying on the Buddha's wisdom body to accord with the practice of the Buddha vehicle.

['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a23_12']	次第二會中，又「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺」，明不移本處而至報宅中居，為普光明殿，明理智之行報得之宅，寄同世間蘭若契證方詣宅居。	次第二會中，又「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺」，明不移本處而至報宅中居，為普光明殿，明理智之行報得之宅，寄同世間蘭若契證方詣宅居。	Next, in the second assembly, it again says, At that time, the World-Honored One was in the country of Magadha, in the forest of Dharma and Bodhimanda, having just attained perfect enlightenment, clarifying that without leaving the original place, he arrived at the house of retribution, which is the Hall of Universal Radiance, clarifying the house of retribution obtained through the practice of wisdom and principle. It is provisionally the same as the forest in the world, and only after the realization of the truth can one go to the house.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a25_9']	自此以去上昇天宮，皆云「不離本處而身遍坐一切道場」，或云「而昇如是天」。	自此以去上昇天宮，皆云「不離本處而身遍坐一切道場」，或云「而昇如是天」。	From here on, ascending to the heavenly palaces, it all says without leaving the original place, the body universally sits in all enlightenment sites, or it says and ascends to such-and-such heavens.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a25_20']	上昇天者，明列位進修。	上昇天者，明列位進修。	Ascending to the heavens clarifies the stages of advancing practice.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769a27_11']	不移本處者，明法界道理，以法性妙理無往來內外故、大智體自遍周故。	不移本處者，明法界道理，以法性妙理無往來內外故、大智體自遍周故。	Not moving from the original place clarifies the principle of the Dharma realm, because the wondrous principle of the Dharma nature has no coming or going, no inside or outside, and because the essence of great wisdom is universally pervasive.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b01_18']	次四十卷中，〈十定品〉又云「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺，於普光明殿入剎那際三昧」，明以法界法身為定體，無三世性故。	次四十卷中，〈十定品〉又云「爾時世尊在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺，於普光明殿入剎那際三昧」，明以法界法身為定體，無三世性故。	Next, in the forty scrolls, the Chapter on Ten Concentrations also says, At that time, the World-Honored One, in the country of Magadha, in the enlightenment site of the Dharma of the solitary place, having just attained perfect enlightenment, entered the samādhi of the instant of a thought in the Hall of Universal Radiance, clarifying that the Dharma realm and Dharma body are the essence of concentration, because they have no nature of the three times.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b04_5']	從兜率天下、降神及入涅槃，四十年住世，轉一切法輪，總不出剎那際，以此三昧圓通始終非三世古今故。	從兜率天下、降神及入涅槃，四十年住世，轉一切法輪，總不出剎那際，以此三昧圓通始終非三世古今故。	From descending from Tuṣita Heaven, manifesting birth, and entering nirvāṇa, to dwelling in the world for forty years and turning the wheel of the Dharma of all teachings, it is all not beyond the instant of a thought, because this samādhi is perfect and unobstructed, and its beginning and end are not of the three times or ancient and modern.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b06_14']	如是序致，以總言之，一切過現未來諸佛皆盡一時成佛，并眾生生死亦不移剎那，但眾生妄繫有年歲長短。	如是序致，以總言之，一切過現未來諸佛皆盡一時成佛，并眾生生死亦不移剎那，但眾生妄繫有年歲長短。	In this way, in general, all Buddhas of the past, present, and future attain Buddhahood at the same time, and the birth and death of sentient beings also do not move for a moment, but sentient beings are deludedly bound by the passage of years.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b07_8']	如佛所說，即生即死皆不移時。	如佛所說，即生即死皆不移時。	As the Buddha said, birth and death do not move at different times.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b09_6']	是故經云「一念普觀無量劫，無去無來亦無住，如是遍知三世事，超諸方便成十力。	是故經云「一念普觀無量劫，無去無來亦無住，如是遍知三世事，超諸方便成十力。	Therefore, the sutra says, In a single thought, one universally observes immeasurable eons, without going, coming, or abiding. In this way, one thoroughly knows the events of the three times and transcends all expedient means to accomplish the ten powers.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b10_11']	」如此一品經，總括前後始終之際，無去來，今古性盡。	」如此一品經，總括前後始終之際，無去來，今古性盡。	In this way, this single chapter of the sutra comprehensively includes the beginning and end of the past and future, without going, coming, or abiding, and the nature of the ancient and modern is exhausted.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b14_18']	明從凡夫地一念發心忽然見道，進修十住、十行、十迴向、十地、十一地五位等法，成佛、轉法輪、入涅槃，總不移剎那，為以法界門為開示悟入故，明實教一乘法界之門法如是故，是故以三昧名目明之。	明從凡夫地一念發心忽然見道，進修十住、十行、十迴向、十地、十一地五位等法，成佛、轉法輪、入涅槃，總不移剎那，為以法界門為開示悟入故，明實教一乘法界之門法如是故，是故以三昧名目明之。	It clarifies that from the stage of ordinary beings, in a single thought-moment one gives rise to the mind and suddenly sees the path, and then cultivates the ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and eleventh ground, the five stages and so forth, becomes a buddha, turns the wheel of the Dharma, and enters nirvana, all without moving from a single thought-moment, because it uses the Dharma realm as the means of revealing, understanding, and entering, and clarifies the Dharma realm of the teaching of the One Vehicle as it truly is. Therefore, it is explained using the name of samādhi.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b16_14']	此品都舉此一乘根本法界寂用之門，始終一際無本末時分，故以為成佛之頭。	此品都舉此一乘根本法界寂用之門，始終一際無本末時分，故以為成佛之頭。	This chapter generally presents the Dharma realm of the fundamental quiescent and functioning of the One Vehicle, from beginning to end, as a single moment without any temporal distinction of basis and end, and thus it is taken as the head of becoming a buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b18_9']	次〈離世間品〉亦然，序致「始成正覺乃至普光明殿」者，為普賢菩薩入佛華三昧。	次〈離世間品〉亦然，序致「始成正覺乃至普光明殿」者，為普賢菩薩入佛華三昧。	Next, the Chapter on Leaving the World is also like this. The preface states from the initial perfect enlightenment up to the Hall of Universal Light, because Samantabhadra Bodhisattva enters the Buddha Flower Samādhi.
['ZH_T36_1739_008:0769b19_1']	佛華者，是所修佛行故。	佛華者，是所修佛行故。	The Buddha Flower is what is cultivated as the Buddha's practices.
