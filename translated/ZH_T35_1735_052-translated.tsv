['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893b24_9']	古德分三：	古德分三：	052	Ancient masters divide it into three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893b25_1']	初六門，明大志曠遠行；	初六門，明大志曠遠行；	052	The first six chapters clarify the practice of vast and far-reaching great aspirations;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893b26_1']	二從「十種不思議」下九門，明定慧業用行；	二從「十種不思議」下九門，明定慧業用行；	052	The second, from ten kinds of inconceivability and below, nine chapters, clarify the practice of the function of samādhi and prajñā;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893b27_1']	三從「十種園林」下十五門，明德備成滿行。	三從「十種園林」下十五門，明德備成滿行。	052	The third, from ten kinds of garden groves and below, fifteen chapters, clarify the practice of perfect completion of virtues.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893b27_11']	然約圓融，此意非無。	然約圓融，此意非無。	052	However, in terms of perfect interfusion, this meaning is not without.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893b28_6']	今不壞次，亦次第顯十行中行。	今不壞次，亦次第顯十行中行。	052	Now, without destroying the sequence, it also manifests the practices within the ten practices.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c01_13']	第一行有三門，二三行各一，第四行二門，第五行六門，次四行各二門，第十行有九門，至文當知。	第一行有三門，二三行各一，第四行二門，第五行六門，次四行各二門，第十行有九門，至文當知。	052	The first practice has three chapters, the second and third practices each have one, the fourth practice has two chapters, the fifth practice has six chapters, the next four practices each have two chapters, and the tenth practice has nine chapters. This will be known in the text.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c03_8']	所以用門多少者，檀在初故具三，戒忍通世間故唯一，定慧尊勝故有多門。	所以用門多少者，檀在初故具三，戒忍通世間故唯一，定慧尊勝故有多門。	052	The reason for the number of approaches used is that giving is at the beginning, so it has three, precepts and patience are common to the world, so they have only one, and concentration and wisdom are supreme, so they have many approaches.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c04_8']	智中既多，故般若中略，餘次勝故但用二門。	智中既多，故般若中略，餘次勝故但用二門。	052	Since wisdom has many, therefore in prajñā it is abbreviated, and the other two are used only for the next two superior [approaches].
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c06_3']	又此十行雖約十度，而義多含，故文中或就十度明義、或就行名以釋。	又此十行雖約十度，而義多含，故文中或就十度明義、或就行名以釋。	052	Moreover, although these ten practices are based on the ten perfections, the meaning is mostly inclusive, so in the text sometimes the meaning is explained in terms of the ten perfections, and sometimes the names of the practices are used for explanation.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c06_16']	今初三門，明歡喜行中之行。	今初三門，明歡喜行中之行。	052	Now, the first three approaches clarify the practices within the practice of joyful giving.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c07_3']	三中，初明力持。	三中，初明力持。	052	Among the three, the first clarifies the power of upholding.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c09_3']	此含總別，總者以是十行之首，依此十事加持建立能起諸行故，《度世經》名十建立。	此含總別，總者以是十行之首，依此十事加持建立能起諸行故，《度世經》名十建立。	052	This includes general and specific meanings. Generally, since this is the head of the ten practices, it is based on these ten things to empower and establish them, and one can initiate various practices. Therefore, the Sutra of Crossing Over the World calls them the ten establishments.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c10_15']	別即歡喜行中凡所布施，皆為修習諸佛本所修行等故，是建立行意。	別即歡喜行中凡所布施，皆為修習諸佛本所修行等故，是建立行意。	052	Specifically, in the practice of joyful giving, all acts of giving are for the cultivation and practice of the Buddhas' original practices, etc., and therefore it is the intention to establish the practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c11_7']	十中，初三三寶即境界持。	十中，初三三寶即境界持。	052	Among the ten, the first three of the Three Jewels are the upholding of the realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c12_5']	眾生即僧寶，菩薩之僧即眾生世間故；	眾生即僧寶，菩薩之僧即眾生世間故；	052	Sentient beings are the Sangha Jewel because the Sangha of Bodhisattvas is the world of sentient beings;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c13_16']	餘七行持悲所作業故，正起行故、願持行故、有悲智境行方成故。	餘七行持悲所作業故，正起行故、願持行故、有悲智境行方成故。	052	The remaining seven are practices of compassion, because they are the correct practices, because they uphold the practices through vows, and because the practices with the realm of compassion and wisdom are accomplished.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c14_4']	時即起行之時。	時即起行之時。	052	Time is the time when the practices arise.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c14_9']	後二福智。	後二福智。	052	The last two are merit and wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c15_11']	然第十地大盡分中有十一持，第四加煩惱持故。	然第十地大盡分中有十一持，第四加煩惱持故。	052	However, in the section on the end of the tenth ground, there are eleven practices, with the fourth adding the practice of afflictions.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c16_15']	論判行持中，初二逆行，彼約應化不斷，所以加之；	論判行持中，初二逆行，彼約應化不斷，所以加之；	052	In the discussion of practices, the first two are counterintuitive practices, which are based on the fact that they do not cut off manifestations;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c17_8']	今但約為行本，故無煩惱。	今但約為行本，故無煩惱。	052	Here they are only based on being the basis for practice, so there are no afflictions.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c18_7']	彼有供養持及劫持，無境界持及善力持；	彼有供養持及劫持，無境界持及善力持；	052	There is the practice of making offerings and the practice of eons, but there is no practice of realms and no practice of good powers;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c19_12']	此以時中攝劫，彼以行攝善力依境起供，故並無異。	此以時中攝劫，彼以行攝善力依境起供，故並無異。	052	Here time includes eons, and the practice includes good powers based on realms giving rise to offerings, so they are both not different.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c20_3']	餘名並同，具如彼釋。	餘名並同，具如彼釋。	052	The other names are the same, as explained there.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c21_11']	既數名不同，案名以釋，此無僧寶，有教化眾生，亦未爽通理。	既數名不同，案名以釋，此無僧寶，有教化眾生，亦未爽通理。	052	Since the names are different, they are explained according to the names. This does not contradict the general principle of having the teaching but not yet having the Sangha treasure.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c23_19']	上辨陀羅尼即總持文義，次云受持即領納受行，今云力持即加持任持，故不相濫已下入第五十四經。	上辨陀羅尼即總持文義，次云受持即領納受行，今云力持即加持任持，故不相濫已下入第五十四經。	052	Above, it distinguishes dhāraṇī as the retention of the text and meaning, next it says receiving and upholding is receiving and practicing, now it says power upholding is empowering and upholding, therefore they are not confused. Below this is the fifty-fourth chapter.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c24_8']	第二大欣慰，正辨歡喜行義。	第二大欣慰，正辨歡喜行義。	052	The second great joy and comfort correctly explains the meaning of the practice of joy.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c25_1']	彼但見乞者來，倍復歡喜；	彼但見乞者來，倍復歡喜；	052	They only see beggars coming and are doubly joyful;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c26_10']	今則知由施故見佛供佛等，心大歡喜，初行多同歡喜地故。	今則知由施故見佛供佛等，心大歡喜，初行多同歡喜地故。	052	Now, knowing that it is because of giving that they see the Buddha, make offerings to the Buddha, etc., the mind greatly rejoices, the initial practice is mostly the same as the ground of joy.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c26_17']	十中略為五對：	十中略為五對：	052	The ten are briefly divided into five pairs:
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0893c29_6']	一事佛供佛對、二聞法親善對、三二利行成對、四嚴土化生對、五難見能見難成能成對，文相甚顯。	一事佛供佛對、二聞法親善對、三二利行成對、四嚴土化生對、五難見能見難成能成對，文相甚顯。	052	1. The pair of serving the Buddha and making offerings to the Buddha, 2. The pair of listening to the Dharma and associating with the good, 3. The pair of accomplishing the practices of benefiting oneself and others, 4. The pair of adorning the land and transforming beings, 5. The pair of being able to see what is difficult to see and being able to accomplish what is difficult to accomplish. The textual appearances are very clear.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a01_2']	三、十種深入者，上明預欣當成；	三、十種深入者，上明預欣當成；	052	Third, the ten kinds of profound penetration. Above it clarifies the joy in advance of future accomplishment;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a01_17']	此辨現能證了，即前法施之行故。	此辨現能證了，即前法施之行故。	052	This clarifies the present ability to realize and understand, which is the practice of the Dharma giving mentioned above.

['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a04_12']	」十中，前六有入字，後四以知為初，證入、了知二文彰顯。	」十中，前六有入字，後四以知為初，證入、了知二文彰顯。	052	Among the ten, the first six have the word enter, while the latter four take knowing as the initial [step]. The two phrases realize and enter and know and understand are clearly distinguished.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a05_14']	於中，初四入器世間，前三別入三世、後一總明。	於中，初四入器世間，前三別入三世、後一總明。	052	Among them, the first four enter the vessel world. The first three specifically enter the three times, while the last one generally clarifies [the vessel world].
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a07_10']	別中，現在內數謂多少，行謂剎因，說謂彼彼果中說法，清淨謂剎體，此是通體。	別中，現在內數謂多少，行謂剎因，說謂彼彼果中說法，清淨謂剎體，此是通體。	052	Among the specific [entries], the present internal counting refers to the number of dharmas, the activities refer to the causes of lands, the explanations refer to the teachings within each and every fruit, and the purity refers to the essence of lands. This is the common essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a08_10']	後總句云種種性，即染淨等殊，斯即別體。	後總句云種種性，即染淨等殊，斯即別體。	052	The last general phrase says various natures, which refers to the distinctions of defilement and purity, and so on. This is the specific essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a08_18']	次二入眾生世間。	次二入眾生世間。	052	The next two enter the sentient beings' world.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a09_7']	後四入智正覺世間。	後四入智正覺世間。	052	The last four enter the world of wisdom and right enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a10_3']	於中，前三入三世佛、後一入法。	於中，前三入三世佛、後一入法。	052	Among them, the first three enter the Buddhas of the three times, while the last one enters the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a10_13']	法中，初知差別五乘；	法中，初知差別五乘；	052	Among the Dharma, the first is knowing the distinctions of the five vehicles;
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a12_3']	後「雖知」下明權實雙行，以性不壞相故，雖無分別而說種種。	後「雖知」下明權實雙行，以性不壞相故，雖無分別而說種種。	052	Later, below although knowing, it clarifies the dual practice of provisional and real, because the nature does not destroy the characteristics, although there is no discrimination, it speaks of various kinds.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a13_10']	此中分別即是差別，故晉經云「雖諸法無一無異，而說一異。	此中分別即是差別，故晉經云「雖諸法無一無異，而說一異。	052	Here, discrimination is precisely differentiation, so the Jin edition of the sūtra says, Although all dharmas are neither one nor different, it speaks of one and different.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a15_10']	」次言悉入法界無所入故者，釋成上義，謂悉入法界故無差別，無所入故而說種種。	」次言悉入法界無所入故者，釋成上義，謂悉入法界故無差別，無所入故而說種種。	052	Next, it says, all enter the dharma realm because there is nowhere to enter, explaining the above meaning, that is, because all enter the dharma realm there is no differentiation, and because there is nowhere to enter it speaks of various kinds.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a15_13']	何者？	何者？	052	What is that?
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a16_14']	若別有一入處，則入時失本相，不得說種種。	若別有一入處，則入時失本相，不得說種種。	052	If there were a separate place to enter, then when entering the original characteristics would be lost, and various kinds could not be spoken of.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a17_17']	以當法自虛名入法界，無別可入，則不壞種種矣。	以當法自虛名入法界，無別可入，則不壞種種矣。	052	Because the dharma itself is empty, it is called entering the dharma realm, with nothing else to enter, then the various kinds are not destroyed.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a18_16']	「言如其」下，此上辨知，此下明說。	「言如其」下，此上辨知，此下明說。	052	Speaking as it is and below, the above distinguishes knowing, and below this it clarifies speaking.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a19_18']	夫說法者當如法說，法既權實雙融，說亦即說無著。	夫說法者當如法說，法既權實雙融，說亦即說無著。	052	The one who speaks the Dharma should speak the Dharma as it is. Since the Dharma is the dual fusion of provisional and real, speaking is also precisely speaking without attachment.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a20_14']	第二、十種依止，明饒益位中行。	第二、十種依止，明饒益位中行。	052	Second, the ten kinds of reliance clarify the practices within the stage of benefiting others.

['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a22_10']	遍依此十方能饒益，非但依戒，況戒有攝善，何所不具？	遍依此十方能饒益，非但依戒，況戒有攝善，何所不具？	052	Universally relying on these ten directions, one is able to benefit others, not just relying on precepts, let alone precepts having the inclusion of goodness, what is not complete?
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a23_6']	第三、十種無畏，即無違逆位中行。	第三、十種無畏，即無違逆位中行。	052	Third, the ten kinds of fearlessness are the practices within the stage of being without opposition.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a24_14']	由依菩薩止善，則於十難作能作、難忍能忍，為發無畏心。	由依菩薩止善，則於十難作能作、難忍能忍，為發無畏心。	052	Due to relying on the bodhisattva's wholesome cessation, one is able to do what is difficult to do, able to endure what is difficult to endure, and gives rise to a fearless mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894a27_16']	一障礙難滅、二遺法難護、三惡魔難降、四身命難捨、五外道難摧、六物心難稱、七大眾難喜、八八部難調、九下乘難離、十上行難修。	一障礙難滅、二遺法難護、三惡魔難降、四身命難捨、五外道難摧、六物心難稱、七大眾難喜、八八部難調、九下乘難離、十上行難修。	052	One, difficult to extinguish obstacles; two, difficult to protect the bequeathed Dharma; three, difficult to subdue evil māras; four, difficult to abandon body and life; five, difficult to subdue non-Buddhists; six, difficult to satisfy the minds of beings; seven, difficult to delight the great assembly; eight, difficult to tame the eight groups of beings; nine, difficult to leave the lower vehicles; ten, difficult to cultivate the higher practices.

['ZH_T35_1735_052:0894b09_8']	十中，初三單約善根，願智稱性名不思議；	十中，初三單約善根，願智稱性名不思議；	052	Among the ten, the first three are solely about wholesome roots. Vows and wisdom in accordance with the nature are called inconceivable.
