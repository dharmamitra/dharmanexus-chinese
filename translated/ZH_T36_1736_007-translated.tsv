Understanding that the causes of suffering have no combination is called the truth of the causes of suffering. Understanding that cessation has no cessation, and understanding that the path has no path.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0048b01_2']	四諦性空，本無生滅，不同初教有可生滅。	四諦性空，本無生滅，不同初教有可生滅。	The four truths are empty by nature, originally without arising or ceasing, unlike the initial teaching which has what can arise and cease.

['ZH_T36_1736_007:0048b17_2']	若聞無生，便知一切諸法本自不生、今則無滅，即生滅而無生滅，故不礙於生滅，滅惡生善、悲智兼濟，成菩薩乘。	若聞無生，便知一切諸法本自不生、今則無滅，即生滅而無生滅，故不礙於生滅，滅惡生善、悲智兼濟，成菩薩乘。	If one hears of non-arising, one immediately knows that all dharmas are originally unborn and now unceasing, and within arising and ceasing there is no arising and ceasing. Therefore, it does not obstruct arising and ceasing. One ends evil and gives rise to goodness, with compassion and wisdom equally benefiting, becoming the bodhisattva vehicle.

['ZH_T36_1736_007:0048b21_12']	以無所得能得菩提，故言三乘同稟般若。	以無所得能得菩提，故言三乘同稟般若。	Because through non-attainment one can attain bodhi, it is said that the three vehicles equally rely on prajñā.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0048b22_8']	以此義推，則二乘人同學二空也。	以此義推，則二乘人同學二空也。	Based on this meaning, it can be inferred that the two vehicles also study the two kinds of emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0048b24_6']	而云等者，具云欲得緣覺乘當學般若波羅蜜，欲得菩薩乘當學般若波羅蜜。	而云等者，具云欲得緣覺乘當學般若波羅蜜，欲得菩薩乘當學般若波羅蜜。	As for the phrase and so on, it is fully stated as if one wishes to attain the pratyekabuddha vehicle, one should study prajñā-pāramitā; if one wishes to attain the bodhisattva vehicle, one should study prajñā-pāramitā.

['ZH_T36_1736_007:0048c01_3']	別有二義：	別有二義：	Distinct has two meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0048c01_14']	不名、不共，次下當釋。	不名、不共，次下當釋。	not named and not shared, which will be explained below.

['ZH_T36_1736_007:0050b13_10']	謂大小乘論同立此名故，濫涉之失不在於己。	謂大小乘論同立此名故，濫涉之失不在於己。	Because the names are established in the same way in both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna treatises, the error of overlapping does not lie with us.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0050b13_15']	若有難言：	若有難言：	If there is a difficulty, it is said:

['ZH_T36_1736_007:0050b15_9']	故今釋云：	故今釋云：	Therefore, the explanation now is:
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0050b15_18']	《智論》是隨他名。	《智論》是隨他名。	The Treatise on the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra is a name spoken from the perspective of others.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0050b16_8']	《成論》小乘云何亦名三藏？	《成論》小乘云何亦名三藏？	How is it that the Hīnayāna of the Treatise on the Establishment of the Doctrine is also called Tripiṭaka?

['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b03_4']	雖則四教各傍兼有，覈定不成。	雖則四教各傍兼有，覈定不成。	Although the four teachings each have a side that includes the others, when examined and determined, they do not form.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b03_9']	云何不成？	云何不成？	How do they not form?
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b05_11']	初藏教通等不成者，雖有同稟無常，二乘一生得發真斷結，菩薩三祇不證，故通義不成。	初藏教通等不成者，雖有同稟無常，二乘一生得發真斷結，菩薩三祇不證，故通義不成。	First, the common teaching and so forth do not form. Although there is the same understanding of impermanence, the two vehicles attain the realization of severing bonds in one lifetime, while bodhisattvas do not realize it in three asaṃkhyeya kalpas, therefore the common meaning does not form.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b07_12']	雖為菩薩別說四弘六度，不詮別理、不斷別惑，由約生滅四諦而起於見，豈得稱別？	雖為菩薩別說四弘六度，不詮別理、不斷別惑，由約生滅四諦而起於見，豈得稱別？	Although the four great vows and six perfections are specifically explained for bodhisattvas, they do not expound a separate principle or sever separate delusions. Because they arise from the four truths of arising and ceasing, how can they be called separate?
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b08_13']	雖說一切種智者，菩薩因中不得即具種智。	雖說一切種智者，菩薩因中不得即具種智。	Although it is said that one attains the knowledge of all modes, bodhisattvas in the causal stage do not immediately possess the knowledge of all modes.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b09_14']	又此種智唯照二諦、不照中道，豈得稱圓？	又此種智唯照二諦、不照中道，豈得稱圓？	Moreover, this knowledge of all modes only illuminates the two truths, not the middle way, so how can it be called perfect?
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b10_14']	是則覈後三義不成，但成當教三藏義耳。	是則覈後三義不成，但成當教三藏義耳。	This then examines the three later meanings and finds them to be unestablished, but it only establishes the meaning of the Tripiṭaka teaching in this teaching.

['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b13_5']	又云已得故，雖說道種智，秖照界內俗，非如來藏恒沙功德故。	又云已得故，雖說道種智，秖照界內俗，非如來藏恒沙功德故。	It is also said that it has already been attained. Although the knowledge of the path is taught, it only illuminates the conventional truth within the realm, not the inexhaustible merits of the tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b14_9']	雖說一切種智，秖照二諦，非照中道不思議二諦故。	雖說一切種智，秖照二諦，非照中道不思議二諦故。	Although the knowledge of all modes is taught, it only illuminates the two truths, not the inconceivable two truths of the middle way.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b15_8']	故覈三教之義不成，但成通教義耳。	故覈三教之義不成，但成通教義耳。	Therefore, the meaning of the three teachings is examined and found to be unestablished, but it only establishes the meaning of the shared teaching.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b16_18']	別教三不成者，雖說三藏恒沙佛法、無量戒定慧，異生滅三故。	別教三不成者，雖說三藏恒沙佛法、無量戒定慧，異生滅三故。	As for the three incompletenesses of the Distinct Teaching, although it speaks of the innumerable Buddha Dharmas of the Tripiṭaka Teaching, and of the immeasurable precepts, concentration, and wisdom, they are different from the three of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T36_1736_007:0051b18_4']	雖說無生空理，是不可得空，非但是空二乘同見故。	雖說無生空理，是不可得空，非但是空二乘同見故。	Although it speaks of the principle of non-arising emptiness, it is the emptiness of non-attainment, and is not merely emptiness, because the two vehicles share the same view.
