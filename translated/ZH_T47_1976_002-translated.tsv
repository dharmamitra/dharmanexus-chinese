['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b07_9']	乍使引之晤室，熱旃炙沈，不終日而悲其昔之穢，厭離之不早也！	乍使引之晤室，熱旃炙沈，不終日而悲其昔之穢，厭離之不早也！	002	If they are suddenly led into a room with sandalwood incense burning, they will grieve over their former filth and regret not having become disgusted with it sooner.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b08_9']	夫生死臭穢，愈於鮑肆，眾生貪嗜，倍彼蠅蚋；	夫生死臭穢，愈於鮑肆，眾生貪嗜，倍彼蠅蚋；	002	The stench of birth and death is worse than the smell of fish, yet sentient beings crave it even more than flies and gnats.

['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b20_10']	一、一大事者，眾生處五濁世，如因處獄，但以罪之輕重，受等不等罰。	一、一大事者，眾生處五濁世，如因處獄，但以罪之輕重，受等不等罰。	002	First, as for the one great matter, sentient beings dwelling in the five turbidities are like those in prison, only receiving equal or unequal punishments according to the lightness or heaviness of their crimes.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b22_4']	或干小法、或投極網，辜雖不同，至於縲絏之苦、笞杖之罰，未有一人得免者。	或干小法、或投極網，辜雖不同，至於縲絏之苦、笞杖之罰，未有一人得免者。	002	Some violate minor laws, while others fall into the ultimate net. Although their offenses are not the same, as for the suffering of chains and shackles, and the punishment of beating and flogging, there is not a single person who can escape.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b22_7']	何也？	何也？	002	Why is this?
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b22_15']	以入獄者皆罪人；	以入獄者皆罪人；	002	Because those who enter prison are all criminals;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b23_11']	處人天者皆是業報，分段之身故也。	處人天者皆是業報，分段之身故也。	002	those dwelling in the human and heavenly realms all have karmic retribution, and the body of the compounded aggregates.

['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392b29_1']	今眾生以煩惱為家，以生死為園觀，繫心衣冠之囚長，適情金玉之桁楊，豈知大鐵圍山是我棘牆，三界法場之外，各各自有家鄉田地也。	今眾生以煩惱為家，以生死為園觀，繫心衣冠之囚長，適情金玉之桁楊，豈知大鐵圍山是我棘牆，三界法場之外，各各自有家鄉田地也。	002	Now, sentient beings take afflictions as their home and birth and death as their garden, like prisoners long accustomed to the chains of gold and jade, how could they know that the great iron enclosure is their thorny wall, and that outside the prison grounds of the three realms, each of them has their own hometown and land?
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c01_5']	諸佛憫此，酸心痛骨，是故為分別淨穢，指以脫歸路程。	諸佛憫此，酸心痛骨，是故為分別淨穢，指以脫歸路程。	002	The Buddhas take pity on this, their hearts aching and bones pained, and therefore they distinguish between purity and impurity, pointing out the way to escape and return.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c01_18']	而歲久拋棄之人，了無歸處；	而歲久拋棄之人，了無歸處；	002	But for those abandoned for a long time, there is nowhere to return;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c02_9']	諸佛又大建宅舍以安之。	諸佛又大建宅舍以安之。	002	The Buddhas then build houses to accommodate them.

['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c04_6']	嗟夫！	嗟夫！	002	Alas!
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c05_16']	燭三界之長夜，揭億生之覆盆，諸佛既不惜垂手，眾生獨何苦戀戀也？	燭三界之長夜，揭億生之覆盆，諸佛既不惜垂手，眾生獨何苦戀戀也？	002	Illuminating the long night of the three realms, lifting the inverted basin of billions of lives, the Buddhas do not begrudge extending their hands, but why do sentient beings alone suffer so much attachment?
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c05_19']	經曰：	經曰：	002	The sutra says:
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c06_12']	「如來為一大事，出現於世。	「如來為一大事，出現於世。	002	The Tathagata appears in the world for the sake of one great matter.

['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c08_5']	眾生種種反戀此毛頭許事，以小易大，甘心瘦死，何哉？	眾生種種反戀此毛頭許事，以小易大，甘心瘦死，何哉？	002	Sentient beings, in various ways, are attached to this small matter, exchanging the great for the small, willingly dying of starvation. Why is this?
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c09_9']	二、宿因深者，有三：	二、宿因深者，有三：	002	Second, those with deep past causes have three:
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c09_14']	一者正因；	一者正因；	002	First, the correct cause;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c09_19']	二者正願；	二者正願；	002	Second, the correct vow;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c10_2']	三者正行。	三者正行。	002	Third, the correct practice.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c12_3']	一、正因者，即是三世諸佛與諸有情，自清淨體，如萬象依空、山川依地、穀依種子、花果依仁。	一、正因者，即是三世諸佛與諸有情，自清淨體，如萬象依空、山川依地、穀依種子、花果依仁。	002	First, the correct cause is the pure essence of the Buddhas of the three times and all sentient beings, like myriad forms relying on space, mountains and rivers relying on the earth, grains relying on seeds, flowers and fruits relying on kindness.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c12_13']	若無此因，佛果不成。	若無此因，佛果不成。	002	If this cause did not exist, the fruition of Buddhahood would not be accomplished.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c12_17']	何以故？	何以故？	002	Why is this?
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c13_11']	一切悲智，純依此因而得建立。	一切悲智，純依此因而得建立。	002	All compassion and wisdom are established solely based on this cause.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c13_20']	故長者《合論》曰：	故長者《合論》曰：	002	Therefore, the elder [Zhizhe] said in the Combined Discussions:
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c15_2']	「如來藏身，即法身也，諸福智海，莫不居中，故稱為藏。	「如來藏身，即法身也，諸福智海，莫不居中，故稱為藏。	002	The Tathāgata's hidden body is the Dharma body. All oceans of blessings and wisdom dwell within it, thus it is called the hidden.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c16_7']	若不見法身，一切福智，大慈大悲，悉皆不辦，總屬生滅。	若不見法身，一切福智，大慈大悲，悉皆不辦，總屬生滅。	002	If one does not see the Dharma body, all blessings, wisdom, great compassion, and great kindness will not be accomplished, and are all subject to birth and death.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c16_17']	」法身者，即正因是。	」法身者，即正因是。	002	The Dharma body is precisely the true cause.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c18_14']	二、正願者，如本經法藏比丘於自在王如來所，發四十八大願，一願不成不取菩提。	二、正願者，如本經法藏比丘於自在王如來所，發四十八大願，一願不成不取菩提。	002	Second, the correct vow is as stated in the sutra, where Dharma Treasury Bodhisattva made forty-eight great vows before Sovereign King Tathāgata, vowing not to attain enlightenment until each vow was fulfilled.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c20_18']	此是依自性無量悲智，發如是不可思議願力，非是心外見有眾生，發願欲度，以眾生非心外故。	此是依自性無量悲智，發如是不可思議願力，非是心外見有眾生，發願欲度，以眾生非心外故。	002	This is based on immeasurable compassion and wisdom from one's own nature, giving rise to such inconceivable vow power. It is not about seeing sentient beings outside the mind and vowing to save them, because sentient beings are not outside the mind.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c21_8']	三、正行者，如本經言：	三、正行者，如本經言：	002	Third, correct practice is as stated in the sutra:
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c23_7']	「發是願已，如是安住種種功德，修習如是菩薩行，經於無量無數億那由他百千劫」內。	「發是願已，如是安住種種功德，修習如是菩薩行，經於無量無數億那由他百千劫」內。	002	Having made this vow, abiding in various merits in this way, cultivating such bodhisattva practices for innumerable, countless hundreds of thousands of eons.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c23_20']	又如《一向出生菩薩經》云：	又如《一向出生菩薩經》云：	002	Moreover, as the Ekottarika-āgama Sūtra says:
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c26_10']	「阿彌陀佛昔為太子，聞此微妙法門奉持精進，七千歲中脅不至席，不念愛欲財寶，不問他事，常獨處止意不傾動；	「阿彌陀佛昔為太子，聞此微妙法門奉持精進，七千歲中脅不至席，不念愛欲財寶，不問他事，常獨處止意不傾動；	002	In the past, when Amitābha Buddha was a prince, he heard this subtle Dharma door, upheld it with diligence, for seven thousand years his side did not touch a mat, he did not think of desire or wealth, did not ask about other matters, always stayed alone with his mind unmoved;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c27_7']	復教化八千億萬那由他人得不退轉。	復教化八千億萬那由他人得不退轉。	002	he also taught and transformed eight thousand koṭīs of nayutas of people, causing them to attain irreversibility.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c28_9']	」此是自性行持、自性精進，非是有作、有為功德；	」此是自性行持、自性精進，非是有作、有為功德；	002	This is the upholding of the intrinsic nature, the intrinsic nature of diligence, not the merits of conditioned, fabricated activity;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c28_19']	雖歷億劫，不離一念。	雖歷億劫，不離一念。	002	although passing through countless eons, it is not apart from a single thought.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0392c29_14']	以微妙法門，離一切行、一切劫故。	以微妙法門，離一切行、一切劫故。	002	Because the subtle Dharma door is apart from all practices and all eons.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a01_14']	是謂正因、正行、正願，如伊三點，缺一不成；	是謂正因、正行、正願，如伊三點，缺一不成；	002	This is called the right cause, right practice, and right vow, like the three dots of the letter i - lacking one, it is incomplete;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a02_2']	非是作得，非不作得。	非是作得，非不作得。	002	It is not attained through action, nor is it not attained without action.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a02_7']	故先德云：	故先德云：	002	Therefore, an ancient worthy said:
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a02_18']	「根深果茂，源遠流長。	「根深果茂，源遠流長。	002	With deep roots, the fruit is luxuriant; with a distant source, the flow is long.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a03_6']	宿因既深，教起亦大。	宿因既深，教起亦大。	002	Since the past causes are deep, the teachings that arise are also great.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a03_12']	」誠然乎哉！	」誠然乎哉！	002	This is truly so!
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a04_20']	三、顯果德者，如《華嚴經．普賢行願品》云：	三、顯果德者，如《華嚴經．普賢行願品》云：	002	Third, revealing the fruition virtues, as the Universal Worthy's Practices and Vows Chapter of the Flower Ornament Sutra says:

['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a11_13']	」是故當知，一切諸佛取佛果者，依於眾生；	」是故當知，一切諸佛取佛果者，依於眾生；	002	Therefore, you should know that all Buddhas who attain Buddhahood rely on sentient beings;
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a12_3']	若無眾生，佛果不成。	若無眾生，佛果不成。	002	If there were no sentient beings, Buddhahood would not be accomplished.
['ZH_T47_1976_002:0393a12_17']	譬如漢王以救民故，而有百戰；	譬如漢王以救民故，而有百戰；	002	It is like the Han king who fought a hundred battles in order to save the people;
