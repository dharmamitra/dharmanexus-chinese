['ZH_T41_1821_023:0354b12_1']	故得果時於勝果道必定未得。	故得果時於勝果道必定未得。	Therefore, when one attains a fruit, one definitely does not yet obtain the superior path of a fruit.
['ZH_T41_1821_023:0354b13_1']	以得果心於勝果道所對治惑非對治故。	以得果心於勝果道所對治惑非對治故。	Because the mind that attains a fruit is not the antidote to the passions that are the objects to be counteracted by the superior path of a fruit.
