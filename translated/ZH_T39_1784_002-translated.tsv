['ZH_T39_1784_002:0017c25_12']	光明各二義，譬般若、解脫各具二德。	光明各二義，譬般若、解脫各具二德。	The two meanings of light and brightness each illustrate prajñā and liberation each possessing two virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0017c26_6']	光云除闇、明云無闇，義有何別？	光云除闇、明云無闇，義有何別？	What is the difference between the meaning of light removing darkness and brightness being without darkness?
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0017c28_5']	光能破闇故名為除，闇更不生故名為無，乃以除闇譬般若除惑、無闇譬解脫眾累永盡。	光能破闇故名為除，闇更不生故名為無，乃以除闇譬般若除惑、無闇譬解脫眾累永盡。	Light is able to destroy darkness, so it is called removing. Darkness does not arise again, so it is called being without. Thus, removing darkness illustrates prajñā removing delusions, and being without darkness illustrates liberation with the eternal extinction of all afflictions.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0017c29_5']	此師雖昧三德互具，以譬對法不無所以。	此師雖昧三德互具，以譬對法不無所以。	Although this master is unclear about the three virtues mutually possessing each other, there is still a reason for matching the analogies with the Dharma.

Because they possess many virtues, they have many names. Because they are permanent, blissful, self, and pure, they are called the three virtues. Because they are venerable and worthy of respect, they are called the three treasures. Because they are unborn and unceasing, they are called the three nirvanas. Because they are the aggregation of dharmas, they are called the three bodies. Because they are the seeds of the Tathāgata, they are called the three causes. Because they are the same as reality, they are called the three paths.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a19_1']	既其法門體本不別，故分置三因，即是分置三身三德。	既其法門體本不別，故分置三因，即是分置三身三德。	Since the essence of the Dharma gates is originally not different, therefore dividing into three causes is the same as dividing into three bodies and three virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a20_3']	兩節注云云者，今準《大經》說圓三德互具之相。	兩節注云云者，今準《大經》說圓三德互具之相。	The two sections that say and so on now refer to the mutual possession of the perfect three virtues as explained in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.

['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a23_16']	以直解脫非解脫，解脫必具法身般若。	以直解脫非解脫，解脫必具法身般若。	Direct liberation is not liberation, liberation must be endowed with Dharma body and prajñā.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a25_7']	彼既分置，乃令三位各唯一德，則因不攝果、果不攝因，故云不通。	彼既分置，乃令三位各唯一德，則因不攝果、果不攝因，故云不通。	Since they are divided, it causes the three stages to each have only one virtue, then the cause does not include the effect, and the effect does not include the cause, therefore it is said to be not applicable.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a25_13']	二、乖圓別。	二、乖圓別。	Second, it contradicts the perfect and distinct.

['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a27_4']	圓四德者，法身乃是性中三德：	圓四德者，法身乃是性中三德：	As for the four perfect virtues, the Dharma body is the three virtues within the nature:
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a27_19']	法身常我、般若故淨、解脫故樂。	法身常我、般若故淨、解脫故樂。	The Dharma body is permanent and self, prajñā is therefore pure, and liberation is therefore blissful.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018a29_6']	此四在性但名法身，全性發修必成三智，智冥性德同性具四。	此四在性但名法身，全性發修必成三智，智冥性德同性具四。	These four in the nature are only called the Dharma body. Fully developing the nature must accomplish the three knowledges. The knowledge merges with the virtuous qualities of the nature and equally possesses the four.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b01_5']	從照了義但名般若，智合性故解脫應機。	從照了義但名般若，智合性故解脫應機。	From the meaning of illuminating understanding, it is only called prajñā. Because the knowledge merges with the nature, liberation responds to the capacities.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b02_13']	既全性起，必成三脫，是故同性具於四德，從起用義但名解脫。	既全性起，必成三脫，是故同性具於四德，從起用義但名解脫。	Since it fully develops from the nature, it must accomplish the three liberations. Therefore, it equally possesses the four virtues with the nature. From the meaning of developing function, it is only called liberation.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b03_13']	般若契性，同性具四，其相易知，故不別示。	般若契性，同性具四，其相易知，故不別示。	The nature of prajñā is the same nature endowed with the four [virtues]. Its characteristics are easy to understand, so they are not specifically shown.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b04_17']	解脫應機，起成外用，同性具德，其相難解，故今別示。	解脫應機，起成外用，同性具德，其相難解，故今別示。	Liberation arises in response to capacities, forming external functions. The same nature is endowed with virtues. Its characteristics are difficult to understand, so they are now specifically shown.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b05_10']	果即二死，脫此苦故名為樂德。	果即二死，脫此苦故名為樂德。	The fruition is the two deaths. Being liberated from this suffering is called the virtue of bliss.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b06_4']	因即五住，脫此染故名為淨德。	因即五住，脫此染故名為淨德。	The causes are the five kinds of existence. Being liberated from this defilement is called the virtue of purity.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b06_19']	永無二縛，性即自在，故名我德。	永無二縛，性即自在，故名我德。	Forever without the two bonds, the nature is just self-mastery, so it is called the virtue of self.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b08_2']	惑因死果是生滅法，本來解脫非此因果，故名常德。	惑因死果是生滅法，本來解脫非此因果，故名常德。	The causes of delusion and the fruition of death are dharmas of arising and ceasing. Originally liberated, they are not this cause and effect, so it is called the virtue of permanence.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b09_6']	雖是離縛說此四德，然縛本空，是故四德全同於性。	雖是離縛說此四德，然縛本空，是故四德全同於性。	Although it is said that these four virtues are due to being liberated from the bonds, the bonds are originally empty. Therefore, the four virtues are completely the same as the nature.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b09_16']	別四德者，約三身說。	別四德者，約三身說。	The separate four virtues are explained in terms of the three bodies.

['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b12_4']	應身智慧照破惑染，別當淨德。	應身智慧照破惑染，別當淨德。	The wisdom of the reward body illuminates and breaks through deluded defilements, which should be the virtue of purity.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b13_8']	化身三昧即首楞嚴，普現色身拔苦與樂，故名樂德。	化身三昧即首楞嚴，普現色身拔苦與樂，故名樂德。	The samādhi of the transformation body is precisely the śūraṃgama samādhi, universally manifesting physical forms to rescue from suffering and bestow happiness, thus called the virtue of happiness.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b14_2']	別是教道，故以三身分對四德。	別是教道，故以三身分對四德。	This is the teaching of distinction, therefore the three bodies are divided and matched with the four virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b16_17']	今明圓別二四德者，由此二教多無異部，聞說三身具於四德，失意之者分隔而解即當別教，其得意者互具而解名為圓教。	今明圓別二四德者，由此二教多無異部，聞說三身具於四德，失意之者分隔而解即當別教，其得意者互具而解名為圓教。	Now, the two kinds of four virtues of the perfect and the distinguished are as follows: because these two teachings mostly do not have different schools, when hearing the explanation of the three bodies possessing the four virtues, those who misunderstand them will understand them as separated, which is the teaching of distinction; those who understand them well will understand them as mutually possessing, which is called the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b17_16']	知一一身皆即三身，故一一身皆具四德；	知一一身皆即三身，故一一身皆具四德；	Knowing that each and every body is precisely the three bodies, therefore each and every body possesses the four virtues;
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b19_8']	若三身不融、四德乃別，故善談別教即共有四德，善談圓教即各具四德。	若三身不融、四德乃別，故善談別教即共有四德，善談圓教即各具四德。	if the three bodies are not fused and the four virtues are separate, then skillfully discussing the teaching of distinction is possessing the four virtues together, and skillfully discussing the perfect teaching is each possessing the four virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b19_18']	融別即圓、分圓即別。	融別即圓、分圓即別。	Fusing the distinguished and making it perfect, and dividing the perfect and making it distinguished.

['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b25_16']	一性全在迷悟二修，故使三法橫該十界依正色心、竪徹三位迷悟因果，是故經稱「無量甚深之法性」也。	一性全在迷悟二修，故使三法橫該十界依正色心、竪徹三位迷悟因果，是故經稱「無量甚深之法性」也。	One nature is entirely in both inverted and proper cultivation, thus causing the three dharmas to horizontally encompass the ten realms of the dependent and the correct, form and mind, and vertically penetrate the three states of inversion and enlightenment, cause and effect. Therefore, the sūtra calls it the nature of reality that is immeasurable and extremely profound.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018b26_18']	若其稱此法性而談，則於三位位位具三、一一該徹。	若其稱此法性而談，則於三位位位具三、一一該徹。	If one discusses it in accordance with this nature of reality, then in each of the three states, each state possesses the three, and each one pervades and penetrates.

['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018c01_3']	涅槃是斷德，至果盡滅惑。	涅槃是斷德，至果盡滅惑。	Nirvana is the virtue of cessation, reaching the end of fruition and extinguishing delusions.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0018c02_16']	經既顯云「不可復得、不可復滅」，乃是性中已具果德，豈非道前具金光明？	經既顯云「不可復得、不可復滅」，乃是性中已具果德，豈非道前具金光明？	Since the sutra clearly states cannot be obtained again and cannot be extinguished again, it is the fruition virtues already possessed within one's nature. How is this not the golden, luminous nature possessed before the path?

['ZH_T39_1784_002:0020b03_2']	約三業明淨德者，十界三業皆與六染本來遠離，名法身淨。	約三業明淨德者，十界三業皆與六染本來遠離，名法身淨。	Clarifying the merit of purity in terms of the three karmas means that the three karmas of the ten realms are originally far removed from the six defilements, which is called the purity of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1784_002:0020b04_2']	法身四德妙而無類，強以世金四義為喻。	法身四德妙而無類，強以世金四義為喻。	The four merits of the Dharma body are wondrous and without compare, so the four meanings of worldly gold are used as a metaphor.
