Preface to the Commentary on the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra, clarifying the swiftness.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377a17_13']	謹寫　皇帝為靈味釋寶亮法師製非言無以寄言，言即無言之累；	謹寫　皇帝為靈味釋寶亮法師製非言無以寄言，言即無言之累；	001	Respectfully copying the Emperor's composition for Dharma Master Shi Baoyue of Lingwei Temple. Without words, there is no way to convey the meaning; words are the burden of the wordless.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377a18_10']	累言則可以息言，言息則諸見競起。	累言則可以息言，言息則諸見競起。	001	If one accumulates words, one can stop speaking. When speaking stops, various views compete to arise.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377a25_3']	所以如來乘本願以託生、現慈力以應化、離文字以設教、忘心相以通道，欲使珉玉異價、涇渭分流，制六師而正四倒、反八邪而歸一味，析世智之角、杜異人之口，導求珠之心、開觀豢之日，救燒灼於火宅、拯沈溺於浪海，故法雨降而燋種受榮、慧日升而長夜蒙曉，發迦葉之悱憤、吐真實之誠言。	所以如來乘本願以託生、現慈力以應化、離文字以設教、忘心相以通道，欲使珉玉異價、涇渭分流，制六師而正四倒、反八邪而歸一味，析世智之角、杜異人之口，導求珠之心、開觀豢之日，救燒灼於火宅、拯沈溺於浪海，故法雨降而燋種受榮、慧日升而長夜蒙曉，發迦葉之悱憤、吐真實之誠言。	001	Therefore, the Tathagata, riding on his original vows, takes birth; manifesting his compassionate power, he responds to transformations; departing from written words, he establishes teachings; forgetting the characteristics of the mind, he opens the way to the truth. He wants to make jade and stone have different prices, and the Jing and Wei rivers have separate flows. He restrains the six teachers and corrects the four inverted views; he turns back the eight deviant paths and returns to the one flavor. He breaks the horns of worldly wisdom and closes the mouths of those with different views. He guides the mind that seeks pearls and opens the days of observing the pen. He saves those scorched by the burning house and rescues those drowning in the turbulent sea. Therefore, when the rain of Dharma falls, withered seeds receive nourishment; when the sun of wisdom rises, the long night is illuminated. He arouses the indignation of Kasyapa and utters the sincere words of truth.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377a26_14']	雖復二施等於前、五大陳於後，卅四問參差異辨，方便勸引各隨意答。	雖復二施等於前、五大陳於後，卅四問參差異辨，方便勸引各隨意答。	001	Although the two offerings are equal to those before and the five great ones are presented later, the thirty-four questions are mixed with different distinctions. The expedient encouragement and guidance are answered according to one's intention.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377a27_6']	舉要論經，不出兩途：	舉要論經，不出兩途：	001	To summarize the sutra, it does not go beyond two paths:

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b02_4']	非因非果、不起不作，義高萬善、事絕百非，空空不能測其真際、玄玄不能窮其妙門，自非德均平等、心合無生，金牆玉室豈易入哉！	非因非果、不起不作，義高萬善、事絕百非，空空不能測其真際、玄玄不能窮其妙門，自非德均平等、心合無生，金牆玉室豈易入哉！	001	It is neither cause nor effect, neither arising nor created, its meaning surpasses myriad virtues, and its events transcend a hundred negations. Emptiness cannot fathom its true limit, and profundity cannot exhaust its wondrous gate. If one does not have virtue equal to equality and mind united with non-arising, how can one easily enter the golden walls and jade chambers?
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b05_3']	有青州沙門釋寶亮者，氣調爽拔、神用俊舉，少負苦節、長安法忍，耆年愈篤、倪齒不衰，流通先覺孳孳如也，後生晚進莫不依仰。	有青州沙門釋寶亮者，氣調爽拔、神用俊舉，少負苦節、長安法忍，耆年愈篤、倪齒不衰，流通先覺孳孳如也，後生晚進莫不依仰。	001	There was a monk named Shi Baoyuang of Qingzhou, whose temperament was outstanding and whose spiritual abilities were outstanding. From a young age, he had a sense of hardship and endured the Dharma for a long time. As he grew older, he became more sincere and his teeth did not decay. He diligently propagated the teachings of the sages, and the younger generation of latecomers all looked up to him.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b07_19']	以天監八年五月八日，勅亮撰《大涅槃義疏》，以九月廿日訖，光表微言、讚揚正道，連環既解、疑網云除，條流明悉，可得略言。	以天監八年五月八日，勅亮撰《大涅槃義疏》，以九月廿日訖，光表微言、讚揚正道，連環既解、疑網云除，條流明悉，可得略言。	001	On the eighth day of the fifth month in the eighth year of the Tianjian era, the emperor ordered Baoyuang to compose the Commentary on the Great Nirvana Sutra. It was completed on the twentieth day of the ninth month. It illuminated the subtle words and praised the right path. The chain was already unraveled, and the net of doubts was said to be removed. The branches and streams were clearly understood, and it could be briefly explained.

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b13_3']	苟能涉求，便反迷歸極，歸極得本。	苟能涉求，便反迷歸極，歸極得本。	001	If we can engage in seeking, we will then return from delusion to the ultimate. Returning to the ultimate and attaining the origin,

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b15_5']	有不在今，則是莫先為大。	有不在今，則是莫先為大。	001	If it exists but not now, then it is the greatest.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b15_15']	既云大矣，所以為常。	既云大矣，所以為常。	001	Since it is said to be great, it is therefore eternal.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b16_6']	常必滅累，復曰般泥洹也。	常必滅累，復曰般泥洹也。	001	Eternity must transcend limitations, and it is also called parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b16_16']	般泥洹者，正名云滅。	般泥洹者，正名云滅。	001	Parinirvāṇa is correctly called extinction.

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b19_3']	悟則眾迷斯滅，以之歸名其唯常說乎。	悟則眾迷斯滅，以之歸名其唯常說乎。	001	When enlightened, all delusions cease. What name can be given to this? Only the constant teaching.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b19_18']	又菩薩住斯經者，則已伏滅諸累。	又菩薩住斯經者，則已伏滅諸累。	001	Moreover, bodhisattvas who abide in this sutra have already subdued and eliminated all afflictions.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b20_10']	雖未造極，便能示般泥洹。	雖未造極，便能示般泥洹。	001	Although they have not yet reached the ultimate, they are able to manifest parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b21_6']	眾示無妙泥洹，復以無不示為大也。	眾示無妙泥洹，復以無不示為大也。	001	The myriad manifestations are the wondrous nirvāṇa, and again, not manifesting is the greatness.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b22_1']	更用茲稱經，蓋是重美盡善矣。	更用茲稱經，蓋是重美盡善矣。	001	Using this to praise the sutra, it is truly the utmost in beauty and goodness.

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b24_3']	此是如來神道之極號、常樂八味之都名。	此是如來神道之極號、常樂八味之都名。	001	This is the ultimate title of the Tathāgata's spiritual path, and the general name of the eight flavors of permanence and bliss.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b25_16']	涅槃是異俗之音，音有楚夏，前後互出，乃有三名，謂泥洹、涅槃、泥曰。	涅槃是異俗之音，音有楚夏，前後互出，乃有三名，謂泥洹、涅槃、泥曰。	001	Nirvāṇa is a sound different from worldly sounds, with northern and southern variations, appearing alternately before and after, thus having three names, namely nirvāṇa, nirvāṇa, and nirvā.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b26_7']	言涅槃者、中正天竺之音也。	言涅槃者、中正天竺之音也。	001	The word nirvāṇa is the correct sound of central India.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b27_7']	名含眾義，此方無一名譯之，存其胡本焉。	名含眾義，此方無一名譯之，存其胡本焉。	001	The name contains many meanings, and there is no single name in this land to translate it, so the Indian original is preserved.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b27_17']	般涅言不，亦名為無。	般涅言不，亦名為無。	001	The word parinirvāṇa means not and also means non-existence.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b28_11']	槃者名生、名滅、名因、名相也。	槃者名生、名滅、名因、名相也。	001	Pan means birth, means extinction, means cause, means characteristic.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b29_6']	生是八苦之本，佛既無之，不生也。	生是八苦之本，佛既無之，不生也。	001	Birth is the root of the eight sufferings. Since the Buddha is without it, there is no birth.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377b29_17']	壽與太虛等量，不滅也。	壽與太虛等量，不滅也。	001	His lifespan is equal to the vastness of space, there is no extinction.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c01_7']	不從作因得，故無因也。	不從作因得，故無因也。	001	Since it is not attained from a created cause, there is no cause.

Discussing the Dharma body means the principle of responding and transforming is the same. Speaking of liberation means the various virtues are thus complete.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c05_12']	語此三法，足明神道之極矣。	語此三法，足明神道之極矣。	001	Speaking of these three dharmas is enough to clarify the ultimate of the divine path.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c06_16']	大者，明其常故，亦以大我、大樂、大淨故，後有釋也。	大者，明其常故，亦以大我、大樂、大淨故，後有釋也。	001	Great clarifies its permanence. It is also because of the great self, great bliss, and great purity that there is a later explanation.

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c09_9']	初開三究竟，是一方便，但說解脫是涅槃，而身智是有為也。	初開三究竟，是一方便，但說解脫是涅槃，而身智是有為也。	001	Initially, the three were opened as ultimate, which is a skillful means, only speaking of liberation as nirvana, while the body and wisdom are conditioned.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c10_12']	二方便中，說《法華》破三究竟，而身智故，是有為耳。	二方便中，說《法華》破三究竟，而身智故，是有為耳。	001	In the second skillful means, the Lotus Sutra is spoken to break the three as ultimate, while the body and wisdom are therefore conditioned.

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c14_1']	夫涅槃者，蓋窮原之宗會、數盡之大歸。	夫涅槃者，蓋窮原之宗會、數盡之大歸。	001	The nirvana is the ultimate principle of the origin, the great return of the end of numbers.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c15_14']	其為體也，妙絕於有無之域、玄越於名數之分，言之不能盡、稱之不能訖。	其為體也，妙絕於有無之域、玄越於名數之分，言之不能盡、稱之不能訖。	001	Its essence is wonderfully detached from the realm of existence and non-existence, profoundly transcending the distinction of names and numbers, words cannot fully express it, and praise cannot fully encompass it.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c16_9']	然非稱無以擬極，故寄稱以擬之；	然非稱無以擬極，故寄稱以擬之；	001	However, without praise there is no way to approach the ultimate, so it is provisionally praised to approach it;
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c17_3']	非言無以顯實，故因言以顯之。	非言無以顯實，故因言以顯之。	001	without words there is no way to reveal the truth, so it is through words to reveal it.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c18_15']	其為目也，總莫之大，故稱苞眾理、名冠眾義，故曰一名之中有無量名也。	其為目也，總莫之大，故稱苞眾理、名冠眾義，故曰一名之中有無量名也。	001	As for its name, it is the largest of all, therefore it is called encompassing all principles and having the foremost name among all meanings, therefore it is said within a single name there are innumerable names.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c21_16']	是則宗音無以譯其稱、晉言無以代其號，故欲以此音而當者失其旨、此名而對者乖其致，是為有稱之極言猶不能究，況無稱之極乎？	是則宗音無以譯其稱、晉言無以代其號，故欲以此音而當者失其旨、此名而對者乖其致，是為有稱之極言猶不能究，況無稱之極乎？	001	This means that the sound of the essence cannot be translated to express its name, and the Jin language cannot replace its title, therefore wanting to use this sound to correspond to it misses its meaning, and using this name to match it goes against its principle. This is to say that even the ultimate expression with a name cannot fully investigate it, let alone the ultimate without a name?
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c23_10']	是以涅槃至號，其義贍博，折而辨之則彌論無窮，豈唯般若等三以極其致？	是以涅槃至號，其義贍博，折而辨之則彌論無窮，豈唯般若等三以極其致？	001	Therefore, the ultimate title of nirvana, its meaning is vast and extensive. If analyzed and discussed, it would be endlessly debated. How can it be that only the three such as prajñā can exhaust its principle?
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c24_10']	但略而舉其要者，是以徑此三名入於涅槃。	但略而舉其要者，是以徑此三名入於涅槃。	001	But briefly mentioning its essentials, this is why these three names enter into nirvana.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c25_1']	伊字之譬，不亦宜手。	伊字之譬，不亦宜手。	001	The analogy of the letter i, is it not also appropriate?
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c25_18']	然則此三，名殊而實同，非體異者也。	然則此三，名殊而實同，非體異者也。	001	Then, these three have different names but the same reality, they are not different in essence.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c26_14']	如其體別，則涅槃同於因成假名法也。	如其體別，則涅槃同於因成假名法也。	001	If their essence is separate, then nirvana is the same as a nominally existent dharma formed by causes and conditions.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c27_8']	虛而非實，豈得稱曰常樂者哉！	虛而非實，豈得稱曰常樂者哉！	001	It is empty and not real, how can it be called permanent bliss?
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0377c28_3']	案曇濟：	案曇濟：	001	According to Tanji:

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0378a01_4']	此是垂終之道教，放言異唱，故制名不同。	此是垂終之道教，放言異唱，故制名不同。	001	This is the teaching of the way at the end of one's life, speaking differently, therefore the names are not the same.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0378a03_9']	成天竺之音，義有苞含，此方無一言以當之，故推義不一，亦言無生，復云無滅、亦言無為、亦言無相。	成天竺之音，義有苞含，此方無一言以當之，故推義不一，亦言無生，復云無滅、亦言無為、亦言無相。	001	Forming the sound of India, the meaning is all-encompassing, this land has no single word to correspond to it, therefore the meaning is not one, it is also said to be unborn, and also said to be unceasing, it is also said to be unconditioned, and also said to be formless.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0378a04_2']	所以言無生者，永絕於四生。	所以言無生者，永絕於四生。	001	The reason it is said to be unborn is because it eternally transcends the four kinds of birth.

Its purport transcends birth and death, and surpasses conditioned phenomena beyond the realm of words. Therefore, the Great Awakened One extended compassion to cover the suffering of sentient beings as the basis. However, as the faculties of the various beings differ, the teachings became five distinct types.

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0378c15_3']	既體備萬工，亦何寶不滿。	既體備萬工，亦何寶不滿。	001	Since the essence is replete with myriad functions, what treasure is not fulfilled?

This is the supreme cause for accomplishing nirvana, so it is based on the specific to indicate its excellence.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0378c21_5']	體無生滅故稱曰常，八用自在謂之為我，寂然無苦目之為樂，塵穢永盡名之為淨，體相無邊便名為大，此乃是讚嘆之辭、裒美之稱也。	體無生滅故稱曰常，八用自在謂之為我，寂然無苦目之為樂，塵穢永盡名之為淨，體相無邊便名為大，此乃是讚嘆之辭、裒美之稱也。	001	Since its essence is unborn and unceasing, it is called permanent. The eight freely functioning aspects are called self. The tranquil absence of suffering is called bliss. The eternal end of defilements is called purity. The boundless essence and characteristics are called great. These are words of praise and eulogies.
['ZH_T37_1763_001:0378c22_8']	三歎其工用者，故〈師子吼品〉稱謂「歸依洲渚」也。	三歎其工用者，故〈師子吼品〉稱謂「歸依洲渚」也。	001	Third, praising its skillful function, therefore the Chapter on the Lion's Roar says, Taking refuge in the island.

['ZH_T37_1763_001:0378c27_1']	若尋其名用理數忘言，故聖化㢡被談德萬端，是以就開宗之始，借喻於伊字，云三點不縱不橫，異昔有餘無德之說，明具法身般若解脫也。	若尋其名用理數忘言，故聖化㢡被談德萬端，是以就開宗之始，借喻於伊字，云三點不縱不橫，異昔有餘無德之說，明具法身般若解脫也。	001	If one seeks its name and function, the principle is beyond words. Therefore, the sage's transformative teaching covers the myriad virtues.
