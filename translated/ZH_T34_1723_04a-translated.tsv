['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713a18_15']	一總含體者，一切無漏，若種若現，有為、無為，若因、若果，根本、方便，能成佛德皆名一乘，一乘即大乘，大乘即無上乘，故《勝鬘》云「一乘者即大乘」也。	一總含體者，一切無漏，若種若現，有為、無為，若因、若果，根本、方便，能成佛德皆名一乘，一乘即大乘，大乘即無上乘，故《勝鬘》云「一乘者即大乘」也。	04a	As for the all-encompassing essence, all the pure seeds and manifestations, conditioned and unconditioned, causes and effects, fundamental and expedient, that can accomplish the virtues of Buddhahood are all called the One Vehicle. The One Vehicle is the Great Vehicle, and the Great Vehicle is the unsurpassed vehicle. Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says, The One Vehicle is the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713a19_20']	此本論云「開是無上義」，《辨中邊論．無上乘品》有三無上：	此本論云「開是無上義」，《辨中邊論．無上乘品》有三無上：	04a	This fundamental treatise says, Opening is the unsurpassed meaning. The Anuttara-yāna chapter of the Madhyāntavibhāga-śāstra has three unsurpassed aspects:
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713a20_17']	一正行無上，謂十度，隨修差別有六正行；	一正行無上，謂十度，隨修差別有六正行；	04a	First, the unsurpassed correct practice, namely the ten perfections, which have six correct practices according to the differences in cultivation;
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713a21_10']	二所緣無上，有十二種所緣；	二所緣無上，有十二種所緣；	04a	Second, the unsurpassed object has twelve kinds of objects.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713a23_1']	三修證無上，謂種姓修證等十種修證，通攝一切菩薩所有境行果。	三修證無上，謂種姓修證等十種修證，通攝一切菩薩所有境行果。	04a	Third, the unsurpassed cultivation and realization refers to the ten kinds of cultivation and realization such as the spiritual lineage, which comprehensively include all the realms, practices, and fruits of the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713a28_17', 'ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713a29_9']	故《勝鬘》又云「阿羅漢辟支佛有恐怖、有歸依，四智不究竟，名向涅槃界」，又云「正法住、正法滅、波羅提木叉、毘尼、出家、受具足，此六法為大乘故說」，故知一切根本方便，一切無漏若種若現、有為無為、若因若果，能成佛德並名一乘，三種意生身皆入初地故。🔽二隨勝體，此有六類：	故《勝鬘》又云「阿羅漢辟支佛有恐怖、有歸依，四智不究竟，名向涅槃界」，又云「正法住、正法滅、波羅提木叉、毘尼、出家、受具足，此六法為大乘故說」，故知一切根本方便，一切無漏若種若現、有為無為、若因若果，能成佛德並名一乘，三種意生身皆入初地故。🔽二隨勝體，此有六類：	04a	Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra also says, Arhats and pratyekabuddhas have fear and take refuge. The four knowledges are not ultimate, and are called 'heading towards the realm of nirvāṇa. It also says, The abiding of the true Dharma, the extinction of the true Dharma, the prātimokṣa, the vinaya, going forth, and receiving full ordination - these six dharmas are taught for the sake of the Mahāyāna. Therefore, we know that all the fundamental and expedient means, all the contaminated and uncontaminated seeds and manifestations, the conditioned and unconditioned, causes and effects, which can accomplish the virtues of a Buddha are all called the One Vehicle, because the three kinds of mind-made bodies all enter the first ground.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713b03_7']	一攝事歸理體，《涅槃》、《勝鬘》等中多以法身、真理、佛性名為一乘，故《勝鬘》云「一乘者即大乘，大乘者即佛乘，佛乘者即涅槃界。	一攝事歸理體，《涅槃》、《勝鬘》等中多以法身、真理、佛性名為一乘，故《勝鬘》云「一乘者即大乘，大乘者即佛乘，佛乘者即涅槃界。	04a	First, subsuming phenomena and returning to the principle-body, many sūtras such as the Nirvana and Śrīmālā-sūtra use the terms Dharma-body, true reality, and Buddha-nature to refer to the One Vehicle. Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says, The One Vehicle is the Great Vehicle, the Great Vehicle is the Buddha Vehicle, the Buddha Vehicle is the realm of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713b06_2']	」又云「於恒沙劫行六波羅蜜，不如有人聽受讀誦乃至執持經卷，何況有人為他廣說」，以有為行比無為乘故。	」又云「於恒沙劫行六波羅蜜，不如有人聽受讀誦乃至執持經卷，何況有人為他廣說」，以有為行比無為乘故。	04a	It also says, It is not as good as a person listening to, receiving, reading, reciting, and even upholding the sūtra, let alone a person who explains it extensively for others, comparing conditioned practices to the unconditioned vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713b08_1']	《涅槃經》言「一乘者即是佛性」，此滅化城至於寶所，唯以真如、法身平等名為一乘。	《涅槃經》言「一乘者即是佛性」，此滅化城至於寶所，唯以真如、法身平等名為一乘。	04a	The Nirvana Sutra says, The One Vehicle is precisely the Buddha-nature, this is destroying the provisional city and reaching the place of treasure, only using true suchness and the equality of the Dharma-body to refer to the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713b11_8']	二攬餘歸智體，亦以真智名為一乘，上文自云「方便知見皆已具足，不退諸菩薩其數如恒沙，一心共思求不能測佛智」，智體多是正體、後得。	二攬餘歸智體，亦以真智名為一乘，上文自云「方便知見皆已具足，不退諸菩薩其數如恒沙，一心共思求不能測佛智」，智體多是正體、後得。	04a	Second, subsuming the rest under the essence of wisdom, also using true wisdom to name the One Vehicle. The above text itself says, Skillful knowledge and insight are all already complete. The number of irreversible bodhisattvas is like the sands of the Ganges River. If they single-mindedly think together, they cannot fathom the Buddha's wisdom. The essence of wisdom is mostly the fundamental and subsequently attained [wisdoms].
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713b12_8']	若在因位智劣識強，在果位中智強識劣故。	若在因位智劣識強，在果位中智強識劣故。	04a	If one is in the stage of causes, wisdom is weak and consciousness is strong. If one is in the stage of fruition, wisdom is strong and consciousness is weak.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713b25_2']	四二運用廣體，唯以因智名為一乘，火宅喻中與諸菩薩及聲聞眾乘此寶乘直至道場，唯因行故。	四二運用廣體，唯以因智名為一乘，火宅喻中與諸菩薩及聲聞眾乘此寶乘直至道場，唯因行故。	04a	Fourth, the extensive essence of the two operations is only taken as the One Vehicle based on the causal cognition. In the parable of the burning house, together with the bodhisattvas and śrāvaka assembly, they ride this jeweled vehicle straight to the place of practice, only because of the causal practices.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713b28_3']	五勝出分段體，通取因果出分段死所有理智以為一乘，開示悟入四義之中前三為果二，後一為因二，如前已說，故略不論。	五勝出分段體，通取因果出分段死所有理智以為一乘，開示悟入四義之中前三為果二，後一為因二，如前已說，故略不論。	04a	Fifth, the essence of surpassing the compounded death, generally taking the causes and effects that surpass the compounded death, all the wisdom and cognition as the One Vehicle. Among the four meanings of revealing, understanding, realizing, and entering, the first three are the two fruitions, and the last one is the two causes, as explained before. Therefore, it is not discussed in detail.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713c03_14']	《勝鬘》亦云「如取為緣有漏業因續後有者，而生三有，如是無明習地為緣、無漏業因，有阿羅漢、獨覺、已得自在菩薩三種意生身生」，故意生身所乘之乘名因中二，《攝大乘》中萬行、真如俱名大乘故。	《勝鬘》亦云「如取為緣有漏業因續後有者，而生三有，如是無明習地為緣、無漏業因，有阿羅漢、獨覺、已得自在菩薩三種意生身生」，故意生身所乘之乘名因中二，《攝大乘》中萬行、真如俱名大乘故。	04a	The Śrīmālā-sūtra also says: Just as with the condition of grasping, with contaminated karmic causes, there is continuation of subsequent existence, and thus the three kinds of existence arise, so it is that with the condition of the ground of nescience, with uncontaminated karmic causes, there is the arising of the three kinds of mind-made bodies of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have attained mastery. Thus the vehicle that the mind-made body rides is called the two in the cause. In the Mahāyānasaṃgraha, the myriad practices and suchness are both called the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713c07_11']	六引攝殊勝體，以詮旨二名為一乘，教隨物設趣妙難知，理假智冥體深頗測，故〈方便品〉初以所詮智慧、能詮教門名為一乘，《無量義經》十七名中彼第十四亦名一乘。	六引攝殊勝體，以詮旨二名為一乘，教隨物設趣妙難知，理假智冥體深頗測，故〈方便品〉初以所詮智慧、能詮教門名為一乘，《無量義經》十七名中彼第十四亦名一乘。	04a	The sixth is the supreme essence of attraction, which takes the two names of the interpreted purport as the One Vehicle. The teaching is set up according to beings, and the wonderful destination is difficult to know. The principle provisionally relies on the merging of wisdom, and the essence is profound and can be measured. Therefore, at the beginning of the chapter on skillful means, the wisdom that is interpreted and the teaching of the teaching gate are called the One Vehicle. In the Wuliangyi jing, among the seventeen names, the fourteenth is also called the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713c08_3']	由此蓮華，論有二義：	由此蓮華，論有二義：	04a	Because of this lotus, the treatise has two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713c08_13']	一體出水，二能開敷。	一體出水，二能開敷。	04a	One is the essence emerging from the water, and the other is being able to open and blossom.

The text below also says, The treasury of the Lotus Sutra is profound, solid, and secluded, and the Mahāyānasaṃgraha says, The Abhidharma of the Mahayana sutras, etc.

These nine divisions of my teachings enter the Mahayana as the basis, and are taught in accordance with the capacities of sentient beings. Therefore, this sutra is taught.

Therefore, the three small baskets are all expedient means of the Mahayana.

The practices of the six perfections and so forth ride on this true principle and are able to go somewhere, and thus it is called the Mahayana.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0713c28_9']	此經上云「諸佛智慧甚深無量」，下文亦云「是法住、法位，世間相常住，於道場知已，導師方便說」，本論亦云「念觀者，謂大乘人觀法無我真如法界等故無性，亦云或乘大性故名大乘」，《辨中邊》說真如法界名所緣無上。	此經上云「諸佛智慧甚深無量」，下文亦云「是法住、法位，世間相常住，於道場知已，導師方便說」，本論亦云「念觀者，謂大乘人觀法無我真如法界等故無性，亦云或乘大性故名大乘」，《辨中邊》說真如法界名所緣無上。	04a	This sutra states above that the wisdom of the buddhas is profound and immeasurable, and the text below also says this Dharma abides in the Dharma-position, the characteristics of the world are eternally abiding, having known it at the site of enlightenment, the guide teaches with skillful means. The fundamental treatise also says the contemplation of recollection refers to the contemplation of the non-self of dharmas, suchness, the dharma realm, etc. by those of the Mahayana, therefore it is natureless, and also says or it is called the Mahayana because it is of the nature of the great vehicle. The Madhyāntavibhāga says that suchness and the dharma realm are called the unsurpassed object of observation.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0714a04_3']	方便理者，謂四諦理，二乘所觀皆方便理，故《勝鬘》云「聲聞知有作四聖諦，佛知無作四聖諦」，《涅槃》亦言「聲聞有苦有諦而無有實，菩薩具有」，本論亦云「念觀者，聲聞觀人無我等，由此二理皆理一乘」。	方便理者，謂四諦理，二乘所觀皆方便理，故《勝鬘》云「聲聞知有作四聖諦，佛知無作四聖諦」，《涅槃》亦言「聲聞有苦有諦而無有實，菩薩具有」，本論亦云「念觀者，聲聞觀人無我等，由此二理皆理一乘」。	04a	The principle of skillful means refers to the principle of the four noble truths. The contemplation of the two vehicles is all the principle of skillful means. Therefore the Śrīmālā-sūtra says the śrāvakas know the four noble truths that are fabricated, the Buddha knows the four noble truths that are unfabricated. The Nirvāṇa Sūtra also says the śrāvakas have suffering and the truth of suffering, but not the reality of suffering. Bodhisattvas have all three. The fundamental treatise also says the contemplation of recollection refers to the śrāvakas' contemplation of the non-self of persons and so forth. Due to these two principles, the principle of the one vehicle is one.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0714a16_15']	下經云「說佛智慧故，諸佛出於世，唯此一事實，餘二則非真」，又云「是法住、法位，世間相常住，於道場知已，導師方便說」。	下經云「說佛智慧故，諸佛出於世，唯此一事實，餘二則非真」，又云「是法住、法位，世間相常住，於道場知已，導師方便說」。	04a	The sutra below says, Because the Buddha's wisdom is expounded, the Buddhas appear in the world. This is the only true reality, the other two are not true. It also says, This Dharma abides in the Dharma position, the characteristics of the world are eternally abiding. Having known it at the site of enlightenment, the guide skillfully expounds it.

The essence in the fruition has the ability, and that which is not without is also included in the vehicle, just as cutting is called a knife. That which has the ability is included in the knife, and it is not necessary for the broad manifestation of the ability to cut to be a knife.

The principle and wisdom in the fruition are accomplished through cultivation in the cause, and the cause and vehicle are of the same kind, so they are also included in the vehicle.

There is no separate second principle that is ultimate.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0714c18_16']	無我、解脫雖悉皆等，然至佛果方名為極，故所詮理佛智名一，非別簡三，唯無二極故。	無我、解脫雖悉皆等，然至佛果方名為極，故所詮理佛智名一，非別簡三，唯無二極故。	04a	Although non-self and liberation are all equal, they are only called ultimate when one reaches the fruition of Buddhahood. Therefore, the principle that is expounded is called one by the Buddha's wisdom, and it is not distinguished from the three, because there is no separate second ultimate.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0714c24_1']	又以果一簡別因三，即有二簡：	又以果一簡別因三，即有二簡：	04a	Also, using the oneness of the fruit to distinguish the three causes, there are two distinctions:

Now it is said that the two nirvāṇas are only a temporary city, and the two bodhi are only the expedient teachings set up by sheep and deer. They are not the true, supreme bodhi and nirvāṇa attained and realized by the two fruits.

The sutra says, For those of the three vehicles who harbor doubts, the Buddha will eliminate them all without remainder. Shariputra also says, But we do not understand the expedient teachings. Upon first hearing the Buddha's teachings, we immediately believed and accepted them, and thus eliminated all doubts and regrets. Kasyapa also says, Moreover, we now attain the realization of nirvana, and do not give rise to a mind of delight in the bodhisattva teachings.

For example, the Sarvâstivāda school takes the Buddha's transformation body to be the true Buddha. Now it is said to be a transformation, thus destroying the attachment to three.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715a17_1']	亦有解云，聞昔說三執三皆極，今說一極故破三執，此乃地前菩薩起故。	亦有解云，聞昔說三執三皆極，今說一極故破三執，此乃地前菩薩起故。	04a	There is also an interpretation that says, hearing the teaching of the three in the past, one attaches to the three as all ultimate. Now, teaching the one as ultimate, one refutes the attachment to the three. This is because bodhisattvas below the grounds give rise to this.

For those without the potential, the human and heavenly vehicles are explained. Since one who understands has the four vehicles does not grasp the ultimate, grasping the two as the ultimate is no different from destroying the two. There is no one who grasps the human and heavenly vehicles as the ultimate. The one who grasps does not understand the vehicle, because one who understands the vehicle does not grasp it.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715b22_6']	一者會教，《無垢稱》云「佛以一音演說法，眾生各各隨所解」，此經下云「一雨普潤三草二木生長不同」，此會教同而機有異，三乘取教有偏、普故。	一者會教，《無垢稱》云「佛以一音演說法，眾生各各隨所解」，此經下云「一雨普潤三草二木生長不同」，此會教同而機有異，三乘取教有偏、普故。	04a	First, the teaching is unified. The Vimalakīrti Sūtra says, The Buddha expounds the Dharma with one voice, and sentient beings each understand according to their own capacities. This sūtra says below, One rain universally moistens, and the three grasses and two trees grow differently. This unifies the teaching while the capacities are different. The three vehicles have biased and universal differences in their understanding of the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715b27_16']	二者會理，《寶性論》云「如㝹、馬、象三獸度河，河性無差得有淺深」，又下經云「譬於高原穿鑿須水，若見乾土知水尚遠，若見濕土知水不遠，若見於泥知水極近，水性無差得之有異」，此會理同而證有異，三乘證理有圓、缺故。	二者會理，《寶性論》云「如㝹、馬、象三獸度河，河性無差得有淺深」，又下經云「譬於高原穿鑿須水，若見乾土知水尚遠，若見濕土知水不遠，若見於泥知水極近，水性無差得之有異」，此會理同而證有異，三乘證理有圓、缺故。	04a	Second, the principle is unified. The Ratnasaṃbhava Treatise says, It is like the three animals, the rabbit, horse, and elephant, crossing the river. The nature of the river is without difference, but there are shallow and deep places. It also says below in the sūtra, It is like digging on a high plain to seek water. If one sees dry soil, one knows the water is still far away. If one sees wet soil, one knows the water is not far. If one sees mud, one knows the water is extremely near. The nature of water is without difference, but there are differences in obtaining it. This unifies the principle while the realization is different. The three vehicles have complete and incomplete realizations of the principle.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715c02_11']	三者會行，鶖子自言為是究竟法為是所行道，佛自亦言我設是方便令得入佛慧，《勝鬘》亦言「此六處為大乘故說」，故知行同而修有異，三乘修行有分、全故。	三者會行，鶖子自言為是究竟法為是所行道，佛自亦言我設是方便令得入佛慧，《勝鬘》亦言「此六處為大乘故說」，故知行同而修有異，三乘修行有分、全故。	04a	Third, the practice is unified. Subhuti himself said, Is this the ultimate Dharma or the path to be practiced? The Buddha himself also said, I set up this expedient means to enable them to enter the Buddha's wisdom. The Shoulengyan Sutra also says, These six points are taught for the sake of the Mahayana. Therefore, we know that the practice is the same, but the cultivation is different, because the three vehicles' practice has partial and complete aspects.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715c08_8']	四者會果，此經下言「息處故說二，中路設化城，為引至寶所方為究竟處，為求牛車出於火宅，權設羊、鹿後皆與牛」，《勝鬘》亦言「聲聞、緣覺四智不究竟，名向涅槃界」，即會二乘菩提涅槃若理若智皆歸一乘，故知果同而證有異，三乘取果有初後故。	四者會果，此經下言「息處故說二，中路設化城，為引至寶所方為究竟處，為求牛車出於火宅，權設羊、鹿後皆與牛」，《勝鬘》亦言「聲聞、緣覺四智不究竟，名向涅槃界」，即會二乘菩提涅槃若理若智皆歸一乘，故知果同而證有異，三乘取果有初後故。	04a	Fourth, the fruition is unified. This sutra says below, The two are taught because of the resting place. On the way, a temporary nirvana is set up. In order to lead to the treasure site, it is the ultimate place. In seeking the ox-drawn cart to leave the burning house, the sheep and deer are temporarily set up, but in the end, the ox is given. The Shoulengyan Sutra also says, The four wisdoms of the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are not ultimate, and are called heading towards the realm of nirvana. This unifies the two vehicles' bodhi and nirvana, whether in principle or wisdom, all returning to the One Vehicle. Therefore, we know that the fruition is the same, but the realization is different, because the three vehicles' attainment of fruition has beginning and end.

It is to show that what is attained is extremely profound and difficult to understand, that the purport of what is spoken is difficult to know, that the Dharma attained at the site of the Way has no one who can ask about it, that my purport is difficult to fathom, and also that there is no one who can ask about it. It also shows that the Lotus Sutra opens the provisional approach and reveals the true aspect, which is precisely the blooming and outstanding of the Lotus Sutra.

I set up this expedient means to enable entry into the Buddha's wisdom. Riding this treasure vehicle, one goes straight to the site of the Way, which is bringing together the practice. In the middle, the city of the transformed beings is set up in order to reach the treasure site, which is bringing together the fruition.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715c20_2']	故《勝鬘經》中顯會行、果，「六處正為大乘故說」，正會行故；	故《勝鬘經》中顯會行、果，「六處正為大乘故說」，正會行故；	04a	Therefore, in the Śrīmālā-sūtra, the practice and fruition are revealed and subsumed. The six aspects are rightly for the sake of the Great Vehicle, and are taught for the sake of subsuming the practice.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715c23_11']	法華正顯昔權今實，故顯會教理，令其修證，密會行果。	法華正顯昔權今實，故顯會教理，令其修證，密會行果。	04a	The Lotus Sūtra rightly reveals the provisional and actual of the past, and therefore reveals and subsumes the teachings and principles, causing one to cultivate and realize, and secretly subsumes the practice and fruition.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715c25_5']	由此一乘據實通會教理行果，總解諸文於理名矣，故云會別名之為一。	由此一乘據實通會教理行果，總解諸文於理名矣，故云會別名之為一。	04a	Based on this, the One Vehicle generally subsumes the teachings, principles, practice, and fruition in reality. The general understanding of the various texts is called by the principle, and therefore it is said that the separate is subsumed and called the One.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0715c26_11']	此經正取一乘因果為真乘體，教為方便，故不相違。	此經正取一乘因果為真乘體，教為方便，故不相違。	04a	This sūtra rightly takes the cause and effect of the One Vehicle as the true vehicle body, and the teachings as the expedient means, and therefore there is no contradiction.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716a10_4']	《法華論》名退已還發大菩提心，由鶖子等昔皆求大退修小果，名退還發，非諸不定姓皆退還發心，此應名不定種姓。	《法華論》名退已還發大菩提心，由鶖子等昔皆求大退修小果，名退還發，非諸不定姓皆退還發心，此應名不定種姓。	04a	The Fahua lun calls them those who have regressed and then aroused the aspiration for the great bodhi. This is because Shariputra and the others in the past all sought the great vehicle, but regressed and cultivated the fruition of the lesser vehicle. They are called those who have regressed and then aroused the aspiration, not those of the undetermined lineage who have all regressed and then aroused the aspiration. This should be called the undetermined lineage.

Fearing that their effort in the great vehicle will be destroyed and they will regress and rely on the parinirvāṇa of the two vehicles, therefore this sūtra says, The bodhisattvas who hear this Dharma have all removed their web of doubts. The original treatise also says, The Tathāgata correctly explains for two kinds of people. These two are both of the undetermined lineage. For these two kinds, the one vehicle is taught.

Because of the existence of this gene, it is said that there is one vehicle.

When I become a Buddha, they also become Buddhas.

That is, the Buddha gives predictions of Buddhahood to the two vehicles in this assembly in order to cause them to obtain this intention, that we are equal to the Buddha and not different.

As the World-Honored One said, You bhikṣus, I recall that in the past, for countless hundreds of times, I attained parinirvāṇa through the vehicle of the hearers.

In the state of no remainder, they manifest parinirvāṇa, and for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, they indulge in the wine of cessation and lie intoxicated. Later, they arise from that and manifest receiving the Buddha's prediction, causing all the undetermined lineages of the two vehicles to think like this:
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716b08_14']	往昔耆尊入涅槃者，今皆復起現受佛記，況我今者不希作佛而入涅槃？	往昔耆尊入涅槃者，今皆復起現受佛記，況我今者不希作佛而入涅槃？	04a	The elders of the past who entered parinirvāṇa have now all arisen and manifested receiving the Buddha's prediction.

Therefore, it is extensively explained in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra that an arhat enters nirvāṇa without remainder for a hundred thousand kalpas, indulging in the wine of samādhi, lying drunk and at ease, and later arising from that, only then giving rise to the great mind. All of this is the transformation of the buddhas and bodhisattvas.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716b21_3']	為不定姓者，即第一第二第八少分，為應化者即第九義及餘少分，說於一乘，非全撥其無定性，故此一乘是密意說。	為不定姓者，即第一第二第八少分，為應化者即第九義及餘少分，說於一乘，非全撥其無定性，故此一乘是密意說。	04a	For those of undetermined lineage, it refers to the first, second, and a part of the eighth; for those who are to be transformed, it refers to the ninth meaning and a part of the others. It is said that there is one vehicle, but it is not completely denied that there are no definite lineages. Therefore, this one vehicle is taught with a hidden intention.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716b23_4']	《解深密經》云「相、生、勝義無自性，如是我皆已顯示，若不知佛此密意，失壞正道不能往。	《解深密經》云「相、生、勝義無自性，如是我皆已顯示，若不知佛此密意，失壞正道不能往。	04a	The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra says, The three kinds of naturelessness of characteristics, arising, and ultimate truth, I have all revealed. If one does not know the Buddha's hidden intention, one will lose the right path and be unable to proceed.

Therefore, within this, the one vehicle is established. It is not that there is no difference in the natures of sentient beings. It combines the definite, indefinite, those with the nature, and those without the nature into one.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716b27_12']	故《涅槃》亦言「一乘一道四果聖人皆得作佛，不解我意故，但應如是所說善」。	故《涅槃》亦言「一乘一道四果聖人皆得作佛，不解我意故，但應如是所說善」。	04a	Therefore, the Nirvāṇa Sūtra also says, The one vehicle, the one path, and the four fruits are all attained by the noble ones who become buddhas. Because they do not understand my intention, they should only speak of the good as it is taught.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716c01_1']	今此十義說於一乘，《法華論》中無此具足，《顯揚》說六因、《莊嚴論》八義說於一乘，不過此十，故不敘之。	今此十義說於一乘，《法華論》中無此具足，《顯揚》說六因、《莊嚴論》八義說於一乘，不過此十，故不敘之。	04a	Now, these ten meanings explain the One Vehicle. The Fahua Lun does not have this completeness. The Xianyang Lun explains six reasons, and the Zhuangyan Lun explains eight meanings for the One Vehicle, but they do not go beyond these ten, so they are not recorded.

This includes principle and wisdom, while that only includes Buddha-nature. This only includes subsuming and entering, while that also includes giving rise to. This only includes those with Buddha-nature, while that also includes those without Buddha-nature. This only includes those of indeterminate nature, while that also includes those of determined nature. This often explains the teachings and principles, while that often explains the practices and results. This explains the One Vehicle as real and the Two Vehicles as provisional, while that explains the One Vehicle as provisional and the Four Vehicles as real.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716c08_5']	故《勝鬘》云「若如來隨彼意欲而方便說，唯有一乘無有餘乘等也」。	故《勝鬘》云「若如來隨彼意欲而方便說，唯有一乘無有餘乘等也」。	04a	Therefore, the Shengman Sutra says: If the Tathagata expediently teaches according to their desires, there is only the One Vehicle and no other vehicles, etc.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716c10_12']	與《無量義經》所說一乘辨差別者，如釋名中已廣解釋，是差別相，及第五問答辨等，皆如別章不繁具舉。	與《無量義經》所說一乘辨差別者，如釋名中已廣解釋，是差別相，及第五問答辨等，皆如別章不繁具舉。	04a	As for distinguishing the differences between this and the One Vehicle taught in the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, they have already been extensively explained in the section on explaining the names. These differences and the fifth question and answer are all as explained in the separate chapters and will not be repeated here.

Using this One Vehicle to teach the masses, there is no second Pratyekabuddha or third Śrāvaka. The order is from superior to inferior, not from shallow to deep or easy to difficult in cultivation.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0716c19_1']	故此經中第一周云「餘二則非真」，第二周云「密遣二人」，第三周云「息處故說二」，不說於三，故知不是總無三乘，但應如今所說義也，會彼所修教理行果為今大因，勸住大乘。	故此經中第一周云「餘二則非真」，第二周云「密遣二人」，第三周云「息處故說二」，不說於三，故知不是總無三乘，但應如今所說義也，會彼所修教理行果為今大因，勸住大乘。	04a	Therefore, in this sutra, the first chapter says the other two are not true, the second chapter says secretly sending two people, and the third chapter says explaining two because of the resting place. It does not speak of three, so we know it is not completely without three vehicles, but it should be as the meaning explained now. It reconciles the teachings, principles, practices, and results cultivated by them as the great causes of the present, and encourages them to abide in the Great Vehicle.

The practices cultivated by making vows in the past are all directed towards the great, and are therefore all called bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717b18_18']	所為法者皆為一乘，以佛知見示彼眾生故、悟眾生故、欲令眾生入佛知見道故。	所為法者皆為一乘，以佛知見示彼眾生故、悟眾生故、欲令眾生入佛知見道故。	04a	The Dharma for which it is done is all for the One Vehicle, because the Buddha's knowledge and insight is shown to those sentient beings, because sentient beings are enlightened, and because it is wished that sentient beings will enter the path of the Buddha's knowledge and insight.

Enlightening means causing sentient beings of non-Buddhist paths to give rise to enlightenment and turn away from evil and enter the correct path. Entering means causing those who have attained the fruit of the śrāvakas to enter great enlightenment and turn away from the small and towards the great.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c05_5']	有遍趣行智力故，知深心所著，著謂所樂著所修行也，或即情欲所起樂著，即眾生處處著引之出，故並是勝解智力所知。	有遍趣行智力故，知深心所著，著謂所樂著所修行也，或即情欲所起樂著，即眾生處處著引之出，故並是勝解智力所知。	04a	Because he has the power of knowledge of the various paths, he knows the deep attachments in their minds. Attachment refers to what they delight in and what they practice, or it is the delight that arises from the desires. He leads them out from their attachments everywhere, therefore they are all known by the power of various kinds of knowledge.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c08_7']	有種種界智力故，知其本性，既知不定種姓界欲所修故，初說三乘為方便，今說一乘為究竟，皆為眾生得一佛乘、一切種智故。	有種種界智力故，知其本性，既知不定種姓界欲所修故，初說三乘為方便，今說一乘為究竟，皆為眾生得一佛乘、一切種智故。	04a	Because of the power of knowledge of various realms, he knows their fundamental natures. Having known their indeterminate dispositions, realms, desires, and practices, he initially taught the three vehicles as skillful means. Now he teaches the One Vehicle as the ultimate, all for the sake of sentient beings attaining the One Buddha Vehicle and omniscience.

Therefore this has no nirvāṇa of the two vehicles, because its essence is ultimate.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c16_11']	論云「無二乘者，無二乘涅槃，唯佛如來證大涅槃，究竟滿足一切智慧名大涅槃，三事體義皆具足故。	論云「無二乘者，無二乘涅槃，唯佛如來證大涅槃，究竟滿足一切智慧名大涅槃，三事體義皆具足故。	04a	The treatise says, As for 'no two vehicles,' there is no nirvāṇa of the two vehicles. Only the Buddha Tathāgata realizes the great nirvāṇa. Ultimately fulfilling all wisdom is called the great nirvāṇa, because the meaning of the essence of the three matters is all complete.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c18_7']	二乘不然，唯假擇滅，無大智法身，非諸聲聞緣覺等有大涅槃法，唯一佛乘故。	二乘不然，唯假擇滅，無大智法身，非諸聲聞緣覺等有大涅槃法，唯一佛乘故。	04a	The two vehicles are not like this. They only have provisional cessation through discrimination. They do not have the great wisdom of the Dharma body. The śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and so forth do not have the Dharma of the great nirvāṇa, because there is only the One Buddha Vehicle.

It means explaining the unprecedented Dharma and causing hearing.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c23_3']	云何法者，謂第二說，初以方便種種言詞、譬喻說故。	云何法者，謂第二說，初以方便種種言詞、譬喻說故。	04a	'What kind of Dharma' refers to the second one, which is explained using various words and parables as skillful means at the beginning.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c25_17']	何相法者，謂第四令住一乘，隨眾生根器有於佛性故，令住諸佛法故。	何相法者，謂第四令住一乘，隨眾生根器有於佛性故，令住諸佛法故。	04a	As for the characteristic of the Dharma, it refers to the fourth, which is to abide in the One Vehicle. Because there is Buddha-nature according to the capacities of sentient beings, it causes them to abide in the Dharma of the Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c27_11']	何體法者，謂第六遮，遮無二體唯一乘體，即是諸佛如來平等法身也。	何體法者，謂第六遮，遮無二體唯一乘體，即是諸佛如來平等法身也。	04a	As for the essence of the Dharma, it refers to the sixth, which is to prohibit. It prohibits the non-duality of essence and takes the essence of the One Vehicle as the Dharma-body of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0717c28_11']	三乘因果、觀行不同可有差別，非此所遮；	三乘因果、觀行不同可有差別，非此所遮；	04a	The causes and effects of the three vehicles and the differences in their practices can have distinctions, but this is not what is prohibited.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0718a01_11']	今所遮者，遮無二種法身之體，三乘真如法身同故，非謂遮無二乘體故，一切皆無。	今所遮者，遮無二種法身之體，三乘真如法身同故，非謂遮無二乘體故，一切皆無。	04a	What is prohibited now is the non-duality of the essence of the two kinds of Dharma-bodies, because the true suchness Dharma-body of the three vehicles is the same. It does not mean that the non-duality of the essence of the two vehicles is prohibited, so everything is non-existent.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0718a17_13']	此言意說，劫增之時三災漸輕煩惱轉薄，眾生向好、惡見漸微，命根轉長、漸漸向勝，以上好可欣名之為清。	此言意說，劫增之時三災漸輕煩惱轉薄，眾生向好、惡見漸微，命根轉長、漸漸向勝，以上好可欣名之為清。	04a	The meaning of this statement is that when the eon is increasing, the three calamities gradually become lighter and afflictions become thinner, sentient beings turn towards goodness, and evil views gradually diminish. The life faculty becomes longer and gradually turns towards excellence. Because the above goodness is delightful, it is called clear.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0718a20_18']	眾生無苦化佛不出世，諸化佛出世必向劫減，小災漸起煩惱轉厚，眾生向惡，染見漸盛、命根轉短，漸漸向劣、下惡可厭，故立濁名。	眾生無苦化佛不出世，諸化佛出世必向劫減，小災漸起煩惱轉厚，眾生向惡，染見漸盛、命根轉短，漸漸向劣、下惡可厭，故立濁名。	04a	When sentient beings are without suffering, the transformation Buddha does not appear in the world. When the transformation Buddhas appear in the world, they must turn towards the decreasing eon. Minor calamities gradually arise and afflictions become thicker. Sentient beings turn towards evil, and defiled views gradually flourish. The life faculty becomes shorter, and they gradually turn towards inferiority and evil that is detestable. Therefore, the name turbidity is established.

The power of good karma is weak, and the life faculty gradually shortens, due to the karma of killing. If sentient beings do not recognize their parents, do not recognize śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, their own clans, or elders, do not cultivate meaning and principle, are not afraid or fearful of the results of evil karma in this world or the next, do not practice generosity or create merit, do not cultivate disciplined conduct or uphold precepts, this is called the defilement of sentient beings.

The essence is a combination of the eighth consciousness and the five aggregates.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0718b05_13']	若此眾生增非法貪，或惠刀劍成施器杖，諍訟鬪亂諂曲妄語，攝受邪法及餘惡不善法，是名煩惱濁。	若此眾生增非法貪，或惠刀劍成施器杖，諍訟鬪亂諂曲妄語，攝受邪法及餘惡不善法，是名煩惱濁。	04a	If these sentient beings increase their greed for non-dharma, or give swords and weapons, quarrels and disputes, flattery and lies, accept false teachings and other evil and unwholesome dharmas, this is called the defilement of afflictions.

This is not the greed for wrong dharmas, the swords and so forth that cause killing, or the stinginess that only abandons the swords for the sake of wealth. It arises from disputes and so forth caused by the greed for wrong dharmas, up to and including the other evil and unwholesome dharmas, which comprehensively include all the fundamental and secondary defilements.

If in this world the Dharma decays and disappears, and the semblance Dharma gradually arises, with deviant Dharma turning into birth, this is called the defilement of views.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0718b13_14']	此以五見而為體性，多近外道惡見數生，若飢饉劫起、疾病劫起、刀兵劫起，是名劫濁。	此以五見而為體性，多近外道惡見數生，若飢饉劫起、疾病劫起、刀兵劫起，是名劫濁。	04a	This takes the five views as its essence, and evil views frequently arise, especially among non-Buddhists. If the eon of famine arises, the eon of disease arises, or the eon of warfare arises, this is called the defilement of the eon.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0718b16_8']	此以色薀四塵為體，或通五薀，仍是不相應時為其體，依四五薀而建立故，煩惱增多惡業尤重，便招惡果三災遂生。	此以色薀四塵為體，或通五薀，仍是不相應時為其體，依四五薀而建立故，煩惱增多惡業尤重，便招惡果三災遂生。	04a	This is taken as having the four sense-bases of the form aggregate as its essence, or it is taken as having the five aggregates as its essence, but it is still the essence of the non-associated [dharmas], because it is established based on the four or five aggregates. When afflictions increase and evil karma becomes even heavier, then one invites evil consequences and the three calamities arise.

The Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom establishes the four siddhāntas. Siddhānta means the fundamental principles. The first is the world siddhānta, the second is the individual siddhānta, the third is the antidote siddhānta, and the fourth is the ultimate truth siddhānta.

The principle is not ultimate, and the practice does not encompass the vast. They say there is no vaipulya, but in reality they also have the method of extensively expounding the true Dharma.

Bodhisattvas do not violate, so it is briefly said they do not have [causes and conditions], but it is not that they do not have the causes and conditions of speaking the Dharma due to events.

Even Śāriputra, with sharp faculties and the highest level, still mostly do not wait for parables, let alone the bodhisattvas who mostly do not wait.

The causes and conditions and parables are mostly in the Vinaya Piṭaka. The discussions are mostly included in the Abhidharma Piṭaka. Therefore, it is said that the great [piṭaka] is only nine. In principle, it is not without twelve.
['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0722c27_18']	《瑜伽》三十八大全小十一者，小乘亦記弟子謝往，及不待請佛悲深故，具有記別及自說等，故有十一。	《瑜伽》三十八大全小十一者，小乘亦記弟子謝往，及不待請佛悲深故，具有記別及自說等，故有十一。	04a	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra's thirty-eighth chapter's statement of eleven large and small [piṭakas] is because the Hīnayāna also records the disciples' passing away, and because the Buddha's compassion is deep and does not wait for requests, it has the complete record of predictions and self-expounded teachings, and so there are eleven.

Without the bodhisattva canon, there are no other eleven. They are all explanations of the meaning of following a single distinction, speaking of different numbers. In principle, both the śrāvaka canon and the bodhisattva canon are fully endowed with the twelve.

['ZH_T34_1723_04a:0723a09_16']	一鈍根難悟，二樂小怖大，三耽生死不怖出世，四逢緣不修，五現眾苦迫。	一鈍根難悟，二樂小怖大，三耽生死不怖出世，四逢緣不修，五現眾苦迫。	04a	First, those of dull faculties are difficult to awaken. Second, they delight in the lesser and fear the great. Third, they indulge in birth and death and do not fear leaving the world. Fourth, they do not cultivate when encountering conditions. Fifth, they are presently oppressed by various sufferings.

Because of dull faculties, they cling to saṃsāra. Although they encounter buddhas, they have already been transformed in the past, and do not practice the profound and wondrous path of the Great Vehicle. Because of practicing evil, they regress and suffer again. Because of encouraging them to leave suffering, the two vehicles' nirvāṇa was first taught to them. Therefore, in the Chapter on Belief and Understanding, they first encounter the Buddha, regress and flow into saṃsāra, and are later transformed into the two vehicles, which is exactly the same as this.

This one reality is the ultimate, supreme, and most wonderful fruit. The other two vehicles are not truly ultimate and supreme, so the text below compares the five perfections to this sūtra, and does not speak of prajñā, therefore it never uses the Lesser Vehicle to save beings.

The Dharma that is free from words has not newly come into existence, and is like the treasure site, which is true cessation.
