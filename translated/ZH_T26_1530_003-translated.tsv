['ZH_T26_1530_003:0303b16_20']	謂第二分唯知第一，或量非量、或現或比。	謂第二分唯知第一，或量非量、或現或比。	That is to say, the second part only knows the first, which may be either a valid cognition or a non-valid cognition, either direct perception or inference.
['ZH_T26_1530_003:0303b18_12']	第三自證能證第二及證第四，第四自證能證第三，第三第四皆現量攝。	第三自證能證第二及證第四，第四自證能證第三，第三第四皆現量攝。	The third, the self-verifying part, can verify the second and verify the fourth. The fourth, the self-verifying part, can verify the third. The third and fourth are both direct perception.
['ZH_T26_1530_003:0303b20_3']	由此道理，雖是一體，多分合成，不即不離，內外並知無無窮過。	由此道理，雖是一體，多分合成，不即不離，內外並知無無窮過。	Based on this principle, although it is a single entity, it is composed of many parts, neither identical nor separate. Both internal and external are known, and there is no infinite regress.

['ZH_T26_1530_003:0303b26_5']	四智心品雖有多分，然皆無漏現量所攝。	四智心品雖有多分，然皆無漏現量所攝。	Although the four kinds of cognition have many distinctions, they are all included in the uncontaminated direct perception.

They do not grasp objects in the manner of pincers, etc., that function to grasp objects, nor do they illuminate objects in the manner of lamps, etc., that emit light to illuminate objects. They are like mirrors, etc., that reflect images and illuminate objects. It is said that they are devoid of obstacles because they clearly and distinctly illuminate objects by means of the manifestation of images that resemble objects. It is said that they are devoid of images because they do not grasp and do not conceptualize, and they are also devoid of discrimination. It is said that they are inconceivable because their marvelous functioning is difficult to fathom, but this does not mean that they do not reflect images.
['ZH_T26_1530_003:0303c13_17']	若言無相則無相分，言無分別應無見分，都無相見應如虛空，或兔角等應不名智，無執計故。	若言無相則無相分，言無分別應無見分，都無相見應如虛空，或兔角等應不名智，無執計故。	If it is said that they are devoid of images, then they must be devoid of the image part. If it is said that they are devoid of discrimination, then they must be devoid of the seeing part. If they are totally devoid of images and seeing, then they must be like space or like the horns of a rabbit and cannot be called knowledge, because they do not grasp and do not conceptualize.

['ZH_T26_1530_003:0303c16_8']	若無漏心全無相分，諸佛不應現身土等種種影像，如是則違處處經論。	若無漏心全無相分，諸佛不應現身土等種種影像，如是則違處處經論。	If the pure mind is totally devoid of the seen part, Buddhas should not manifest various images of bodies and lands, etc. In this case, you would be contradicting many scriptures and treatises.

['ZH_T26_1530_003:0303c21_7']	若後得智相應心品有分別故，所緣境界或離體故，如有漏心似境相現分明緣照。	若後得智相應心品有分別故，所緣境界或離體故，如有漏心似境相現分明緣照。	If the class of minds associated with subsequently acquired knowledge is associated with discrimination and therefore does not leave the substance of the mind, then there is a seen part, just as when one illuminates an external object, there is a seen part.

Since there are no characteristics or views, the mind and mental factors cannot be spoken of. Free from all conceptual proliferation, it is inconceivable.

They are called universal activities because they always and universally occur in all places. The Tathāgata is always joyful in understanding objects of perception because his desire is never diminished. He is never diminished in his understanding of objects of perception because he always has a clear understanding of them. He is never diminished in his memory of objects of perception because he always remembers them. The Tathāgata never has an undetermined mind because he is always in a state of samādhi. He is always associated with pure faith, etc., because he is free of defilement. He is free of sleepiness because he is free of regret. He directly realizes all things because he is free of discursive thought. In the class of impure minds, the activities of mind are sometimes many and sometimes few, associated with the mind that is constrained by its objects. In the class of pure minds, the activities of mind are free, unconstrained, and equal, mutually unobstructed.

It is based on the consciousness that is retribution, continues in a series, and is subject to birth and death. After the stage of “heat” in the practice of the thirty-seven aids to bodhi, the seeds gradually increase through the power of perfuming.

From this time on, it is cultivated and increased in the subsequent stages, and it is always actualized when pure contemplation, etc., is present. It is interrupted when impure minds are present.

At the time of the last mind, it is forever after uninterrupted until the end of time, just as in the state of having impurities, the ālaya consciousness always arises simultaneously with the one consciousness called manas. In the state of being without impurities, the great perfect mirror knowledge must always arise simultaneously with the knowledge of sameness, and therefore the knowledge of sameness is also uninterrupted.

This is because it has never been seen that pure consciousness can be produced by impure sense organs. Also, these four wisdoms are not always present before a Buddha, because they are produced by attention and are interrupted from time to time.

If it were indeterminate, there would be the error of the merit of former Buddhas being more or less than that of later Buddhas.

But in reality they are not categorized as aggregates, sense bases, or sense fields, because they are free from the conceptual proliferation of characteristics.

Based on the true, it establishes the characteristics of cessation through discrimination, etc., because it is nominally existent.
