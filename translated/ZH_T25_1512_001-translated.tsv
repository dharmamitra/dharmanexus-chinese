['ZH_T25_1512_001:0799c09_18']	第二意若此般若理教甚深難解者，論主何由得解作論解釋？	第二意若此般若理教甚深難解者，論主何由得解作論解釋？	001	The second meaning is, if this principle and teaching of prajñā is extremely profound and difficult to understand, how did the author of the treatise come to understand it and compose a treatise to explain it?

They make named and characterized explanations of the nameless and formless principle they have attained, guiding us, other treatise authors, and all sentient beings. Therefore, we can understand the profound meaning of prajñā and compose treatises to explain it. The merit belongs to the great sages, not to our own power. Therefore, it says teaching us.

Therefore, the fourth line reveals the author's reverence.

['ZH_T25_1512_001:0800c05_18']	未知說者是誰，若是天魔外道餘人說者，未必可信，故第四次明能說之人是佛婆伽婆，所說故所以可信也。	未知說者是誰，若是天魔外道餘人說者，未必可信，故第四次明能說之人是佛婆伽婆，所說故所以可信也。	001	It is not yet known who the speaker is. If it is spoken by a heavenly demon, non-Buddhist, or other person, it may not necessarily be credible, so the fourth time explains that the speaker is the Buddha Bhagavān, and what is spoken is therefore credible.
