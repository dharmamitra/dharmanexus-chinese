['ZH_T33_1708_01a:0360c22_7']	四名隨世俗有詮表能，汝不許為依他起性，義亦隨俗假說有能，何不許為遍計所執？	四名隨世俗有詮表能，汝不許為依他起性，義亦隨俗假說有能，何不許為遍計所執？	01a	Fourth, the name follows worldly convention in having the ability to express. You do not allow it to be the nature of dependent arising. The meaning also follows worldly convention in nominally having the ability. Why not allow it to be the nature of universal grasping?

It explains that the intrinsic nature of all dharmas is all inexpressible. Names and words express only common characteristics. The individual characteristics of all dharmas are all beyond names and words. Individual characteristics are not nonexistent, and common characteristics are not existent.
['ZH_T33_1708_01a:0361a02_12']	此中略說所詮性無，非謂能詮其性實有，故頌但說彼非有言，不爾應言此性非有。	此中略說所詮性無，非謂能詮其性實有，故頌但說彼非有言，不爾應言此性非有。	01a	This briefly explains that the intrinsic nature of the expressed [dharmas] is nonexistent, but it does not mean that the intrinsic nature of the expressers is truly existent. Therefore, the verse only says the words they are all nonexistent, otherwise it should say this intrinsic nature is nonexistent.

They are unborn, unceasing, and free from grasping. The pure view observes that all worldly things produced by causes and conditions are neither existent nor nonexistent.
['ZH_T33_1708_01a:0361a08_4']	故此非證依他是無。	故此非證依他是無。	01a	Therefore, this is not evidence that the dependent nature is nonexistent.

Therefore, a sūtra says: All dharmas arise from conditions. Conditions and dharmas are both nonexistent. One who knows this correctly is said to penetrate dependent arising.
