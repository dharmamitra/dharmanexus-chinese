At one time the Blessed One was dwelling in the treasury of the Dharma realm, the great palace adorned with various jewels and great merits, together with an innumerable assembly of great śrāvakas and great bodhisattvas, as well as countless great assemblies of devas, humans, asuras, and others, surrounding him in front and back.

By the Buddha's spiritual power, she rose from her seat, bowed her head to the ground, and addressed the Buddha, saying:
['ZH_T17_0840_001:0910c25_15']	「何等名為菩薩惡友，新學菩薩知已遠離？	「何等名為菩薩惡友，新學菩薩知已遠離？	What are called the bodhisattva's evil friends? Newly practicing bodhisattvas should know and stay far away from them.

For this reason, newly practicing bodhisattvas should not live in the same temple, the same room, or the same place for walking meditation, or travel the same road as them.
['ZH_T17_0840_001:0911a05_7']	若諸菩薩，已於大乘具足多聞，得不壞信，我別開許與彼同居，為引發心趣菩提故；	若諸菩薩，已於大乘具足多聞，得不壞信，我別開許與彼同居，為引發心趣菩提故；	If bodhisattvas have already gained extensive learning in the Great Vehicle and attained indestructible faith, I specifically allow them to live together with them, in order to inspire the generation of the mind directed towards enlightenment.
['ZH_T17_0840_001:0911a06_15']	若彼種類善根未熟，不應為說大乘法教，令生誹謗獲罪無量。	若彼種類善根未熟，不應為說大乘法教，令生誹謗獲罪無量。	If their type of wholesome roots is not yet mature, they should not be taught the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, causing them to give rise to slander and incur immeasurable offenses.

When they first give rise to the mind of supreme bodhi, all gods, humans, asuras, and others should make offerings to them. They are already able to outshine all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who have attained the ultimate fruit, and are already able to subdue all māra armies. All evil māras are greatly frightened.
