['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b09_8']	所有一切智智，悲心為根本。	所有一切智智，悲心為根本。	All omniscience takes compassion as its root.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b11_1']	從悲發生大菩提心，然後起諸方便，是故諸菩薩於一切時常行此二種。	從悲發生大菩提心，然後起諸方便，是故諸菩薩於一切時常行此二種。	From compassion arises the great mind of enlightenment, and then various skillful means are initiated. Therefore, all bodhisattvas always practice these two kinds.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b12_11']	所有施等方便現身現土、眷屬色相廣大果報，二種攝故悉得成就。	所有施等方便現身現土、眷屬色相廣大果報，二種攝故悉得成就。	All skillful means such as giving manifest bodies, lands, retinues, and vast rewards, because they are subsumed by the two kinds, they are all accomplished.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b14_1']	如佛世尊不住涅槃，為令一切起於正慧，普能斷除諸顛倒故。	如佛世尊不住涅槃，為令一切起於正慧，普能斷除諸顛倒故。	Just as the World-Honored Buddha does not abide in nirvāṇa, in order to enable all to give rise to right wisdom and universally eliminate all delusions.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b15_8']	又復不住生死，為由生死起顛倒故，是故世尊成就無住涅槃。	又復不住生死，為由生死起顛倒故，是故世尊成就無住涅槃。	Moreover, he does not abide in saṃsāra, because delusions arise due to saṃsāra. Therefore, the World-Honored One accomplishes the nirvāṇa of non-abiding.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b17_8']	又復當知慧及方便自相所行，應當遠離共相毀謗二邊，離二邊故中間所行即得無礙。	又復當知慧及方便自相所行，應當遠離共相毀謗二邊，離二邊故中間所行即得無礙。	Moreover, it should be known that the self-characteristics of wisdom and skillful means should be practiced, and one should avoid the two extremes of slandering the common characteristics. Because of avoiding the two extremes, the middle way of practice can then be unobstructed.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b18_17']	所言共相毀謗邊者，謂慧離共相邊、方便離毀謗邊，此中如是。	所言共相毀謗邊者，謂慧離共相邊、方便離毀謗邊，此中如是。	As for the extreme of slandering the common characteristics, it means that wisdom avoids the extreme of common characteristics, and skillful means avoids the extreme of slander. This is so in this case.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b19_7']	如《聖法集經》言：	如《聖法集經》言：	As the Sutra of the Collection of Holy Dharma says:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b20_5']	若諸相好色身具足，即能令觀者起勝意樂。	若諸相好色身具足，即能令觀者起勝意樂。	If the body endowed with the excellent characteristics and colors is complete, it can cause the viewer to give rise to supreme joy.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b21_5']	若於三昧中觀法身者，即不能令起勝意樂。	若於三昧中觀法身者，即不能令起勝意樂。	If one contemplates the Dharma body in samādhi, it cannot cause the arising of supreme joy.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b21_10']	復有說言：	復有說言：	Moreover, it is said:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b22_8']	慧及方便生諸如來，能令他起清淨信解。	慧及方便生諸如來，能令他起清淨信解。	Wisdom and skillful means give rise to the Tathāgatas, and can cause others to give rise to pure faith and understanding.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b22_13']	如是應知。	如是應知。	One should understand it in this way.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b22_18']	又復有言：	又復有言：	Moreover, it is said:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b24_2']	如世間法應當了知，法尚應捨何況非法，離取相故。	如世間法應當了知，法尚應捨何況非法，離取相故。	One should understand that just as in worldly dharmas, dharmas should be abandoned, let alone non-dharmas, because of being free from grasping characteristics.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b26_4']	彼諸顛倒取著心斷，由彼斷已此說是為真勝意樂，不應於彼所作事中而起決定實依止心。	彼諸顛倒取著心斷，由彼斷已此說是為真勝意樂，不應於彼所作事中而起決定實依止心。	Those inverted minds of attachment are severed. Due to their severance, this is said to be the true superior intention. One should not give rise to a mind of definite reliance on the activities they perform.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b26_9']	亦如有說：	亦如有說：	It is also as stated:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b27_12']	一切法中亦不可取亦不可捨，彼取捨法不可得故。	一切法中亦不可取亦不可捨，彼取捨法不可得故。	In all dharmas, one should neither grasp nor abandon, because the dharmas of grasping and abandoning cannot be attained.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b28_4']	或有說言：	或有說言：	Some say:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b28_13']	施等諸行感生死果。	施等諸行感生死果。	The practices such as giving give rise to the fruits of birth and death.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565b28_18']	此中云何？	此中云何？	What is the meaning here?
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c01_11']	謂離於慧而行施等，得少分善以為喜足起勇悍心，復作增上勝善根想。	謂離於慧而行施等，得少分善以為喜足起勇悍心，復作增上勝善根想。	It means practicing giving and so forth apart from wisdom, being content with a small amount of goodness and giving rise to a courageous mind, and further conceiving of superior wholesome roots.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c02_8']	如《維摩詰經》說：	如《維摩詰經》說：	As the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c03_4']	所有一切法，應與慧及方便二種俱行。	所有一切法，應與慧及方便二種俱行。	All dharmas should be practiced together with wisdom and skillful means.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c04_13']	施等諸行若為慧所攝，即得名波羅蜜多名，異此即非施等清淨。	施等諸行若為慧所攝，即得名波羅蜜多名，異此即非施等清淨。	If the practices such as giving are embraced by wisdom, they are then called pāramitās. Otherwise, they are not the purity of giving and so forth.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c06_5']	此中當知，若住三摩地能生起諸慧，加行專注總彼所作。	此中當知，若住三摩地能生起諸慧，加行專注總彼所作。	Herein, it should be known that if one abides in samādhi, one can give rise to various kinds of wisdom. The practice is to focus on all that is done.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c07_15']	謂由先起聞所成慧，以本宗義而正攝持，然後思所成慧乃得生起。	謂由先起聞所成慧，以本宗義而正攝持，然後思所成慧乃得生起。	That is to say, by first giving rise to the wisdom that comes from hearing, one correctly upholds the meaning of one's own school, and then the wisdom that comes from contemplation can be given rise to.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c09_6']	於是思慧中觀察如實義，彼所觀察決定真實，無別邪妄不實顛倒。	於是思慧中觀察如實義，彼所觀察決定真實，無別邪妄不實顛倒。	Within this wisdom of contemplation, one observes the true meaning as it is. The true reality that is observed is without any other false or inverted things.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c10_6']	如是觀故疑惑止息、正智出生，如理正修。	如是觀故疑惑止息、正智出生，如理正修。	Because of such observation, doubt ceases and right knowledge arises, and one practices in accordance with principle.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c11_15']	如佛樹諸外道說無我法，是中應當思惟觀察，必有正因得涅槃果；	如佛樹諸外道說無我法，是中應當思惟觀察，必有正因得涅槃果；	As for the non-self teachings of the Buddha and the non-Buddhists, one should contemplate and observe within them that there must be a correct cause for attaining the fruit of nirvāṇa;
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c12_12']	異此皆是外道常因分別，非為寂靜。	異此皆是外道常因分別，非為寂靜。	Anything else is the discrimination of the eternal cause of the non-Buddhists, and is not for quiescence.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c14_15']	是故《雜阿含》等說，思所成慧中，如理伺察已，應觀諸物有實自相，而彼自相勝義諦中即無有生。	是故《雜阿含》等說，思所成慧中，如理伺察已，應觀諸物有實自相，而彼自相勝義諦中即無有生。	Therefore, the Saṃyuktâgama and other texts say, Within the wisdom that comes from contemplation, having contemplated in accordance with principle, one should observe that all things have real specific characteristics, but those specific characteristics do not arise within the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c15_8']	如是阿含中所說決定相應。	如是阿含中所說決定相應。	Thus, the definitive correspondences explained in the scriptures are as follows.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c16_8']	如《聖法集經》說：	如《聖法集經》說：	As the Sutra of the Collection of Holy Dharma states:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c16_20']	無生真實，不實謂別異法。	無生真實，不實謂別異法。	Non-arising is true reality, while what is not true is said to be separate phenomena.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c17_15']	如是等皆隨順勝義諦無生，此說真實。	如是等皆隨順勝義諦無生，此說真實。	Such statements all accord with the non-arising of the ultimate truth, which is said to be true reality.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c18_16']	又勝義無生即非無生，彼一切所行皆過去性。	又勝義無生即非無生，彼一切所行皆過去性。	Moreover, the non-arising of the ultimate is precisely not non-arising, for all that is practiced is past by nature.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c19_2']	此中又言：	此中又言：	Here it is also said:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c19_6']	善男子！	善男子！	Good sons!
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c21_11']	生滅二法畢竟皆是世間取著，是故佛大悲者為欲警悟世間捨諸所行，說生滅等畢竟無有少法可生。	生滅二法畢竟皆是世間取著，是故佛大悲者為欲警悟世間捨諸所行，說生滅等畢竟無有少法可生。	The two dharmas of arising and ceasing are ultimately all worldly attachments. Therefore, the Buddha, out of great compassion, wishes to alert the world to abandon all practices and say that arising and ceasing ultimately have no dharmas that can arise.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c22_8']	又《聖法集經》說：	又《聖法集經》說：	Moreover, the Sutra of the Collection of Holy Dharma states:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c22_12']	云何生？	云何生？	What is arising?
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c22_16']	云何滅？	云何滅？	What is ceasing?
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c22_18']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c23_4']	無生名生，無滅名滅。	無生名生，無滅名滅。	Non-arising is called arising, and non-ceasing is called ceasing.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c23_9']	此中又言：	此中又言：	Here it is also said:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c24_17']	阿字門謂一切法離生滅，是即一切法無自性門，自性空所成。	阿字門謂一切法離生滅，是即一切法無自性門，自性空所成。	The gate of the syllable a refers to all dharmas being free from arising and ceasing. This is precisely the gate of the absence of intrinsic nature of all dharmas, accomplished by the emptiness of intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c25_7']	《聖二諦經》說：	《聖二諦經》說：	The Sūtra of the Two Holy Truths says:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c25_21']	若無生平等，即得一切法平等。	若無生平等，即得一切法平等。	If there is no equality in birth, then one attains the equality of all dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c26_10']	《般若波羅蜜多經》說：	《般若波羅蜜多經》說：	The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c26_14']	須菩提！	須菩提！	Subhūti!
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c27_13']	色、色自性空，乃至識、識自性空，自相空所成。	色、色自性空，乃至識、識自性空，自相空所成。	Form is empty of the intrinsic nature of form, up to consciousness is empty of the intrinsic nature of consciousness, accomplished by the emptiness of its own characteristics.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c27_20']	《象腋經》說：	《象腋經》說：	The Elephant's Thighs Sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c28_5']	一切性不可得生。	一切性不可得生。	The birth of all natures cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c28_18']	於無生性中，愚者執有其生。	於無生性中，愚者執有其生。	In the nature of non-birth, the foolish cling to its arising.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0565c29_8']	《父子合集經》說：	《父子合集經》說：	The Sūtra of the Assembly of Father and Son says:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a01_2']	彼一切法皆悉平等，三世亦平等。	彼一切法皆悉平等，三世亦平等。	All those dharmas are completely equal, the three times are also equal.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a02_4']	過去一切法自性離，乃至現在一切法亦自性離。	過去一切法自性離，乃至現在一切法亦自性離。	The self-nature of all dharmas in the past is detached, up to the present all dharmas are also detached by their own nature.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a03_14']	如是總說，彼《阿含》中相應堅固之義應當伺察，異此有因即不能成。	如是總說，彼《阿含》中相應堅固之義應當伺察，異此有因即不能成。	Thus in general, the meaning of firmness that accords with those scriptures should be observed, otherwise the existence of a cause cannot be established.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a05_4']	此中如理決定伺察已，要略說者，謂諸生性，或說有因或說無因。	此中如理決定伺察已，要略說者，謂諸生性，或說有因或說無因。	Having investigated this with proper reasoning and certainty, in brief it means that regarding the nature of arising, some say it has a cause and some say it has no cause.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a05_19']	如實當知，非彼有因、非彼無因。	如實當知，非彼有因、非彼無因。	One should truly understand that it is neither with a cause nor without a cause.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a06_4']	是義云何？	是義云何？	What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a07_6']	若捨因性，此差別性或有實顯示，非彼無因。	若捨因性，此差別性或有實顯示，非彼無因。	If one abandons the nature of a cause, this differentiated nature may be truly revealed, it is not without a cause.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a08_4']	若法生時，乃一切性遍一切處，云何非有？	若法生時，乃一切性遍一切處，云何非有？	If when a dharma arises, all natures are present everywhere, how can it not exist?
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a09_8']	彼無性時或無差別，於生時中亦非有得，非彼有因。	彼無性時或無差別，於生時中亦非有得，非彼有因。	When it is without a nature or without differentiation, even within the time of arising it is not obtained, it is not with a cause.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a10_12']	如是總說，彼非無因而得和合，亦非有因而得和合。	如是總說，彼非無因而得和合，亦非有因而得和合。	Thus it is said in general that it is not without a cause and yet obtains a combination, nor is it with a cause and yet obtains a combination.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a11_11']	如是所說，若計有我，即是外道常因起執：	如是所說，若計有我，即是外道常因起執：	Thus it is said, if one conceives of a self, this is precisely the eternalist's cause for giving rise to attachment:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a12_6']	彼無性得生，能起諸行而為顯示。	彼無性得生，能起諸行而為顯示。	That which is without a nature can arise and be able to give rise to activities and be revealed.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a12_18']	壞諸因性，何能生起諸行？	壞諸因性，何能生起諸行？	Destroying the nature of causes, how can it give rise to activities?
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a13_4']	不如理捨故。	不如理捨故。	Because it is not properly abandoned.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a14_7']	又非外道所執我等自有力能，於他別法得不捨性。	又非外道所執我等自有力能，於他別法得不捨性。	Moreover, the self and so forth grasped by non-Buddhists do not have the nature of being inseparable from other separate dharmas by their own power.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a15_2']	既執常性，不能於他作義利事。	既執常性，不能於他作義利事。	Since they are grasped as having a permanent nature, they cannot perform beneficial actions for others.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a15_12']	若無義利，背相應法。	若無義利，背相應法。	If there is no benefit, they turn away from the dharma of being in accord with others.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a17_13']	此中如是當知，所執我等一切力能，畢竟皆空如石女兒，彼無自性，於所作事中不能成就。	此中如是當知，所執我等一切力能，畢竟皆空如石女兒，彼無自性，於所作事中不能成就。	Herein, one should know that all the power and ability grasped by the self and so forth are ultimately all empty, like the child of a barren woman. They have no self-nature and are unable to accomplish anything.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a18_6']	彼等設有所作，無實力能。	彼等設有所作，無實力能。	Even if they do something, they have no real power.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a19_11']	若非所作又非和合，又如一切事隨有作生已，後時決定。	若非所作又非和合，又如一切事隨有作生已，後時決定。	If it is not something done and also not a combination, and also like all things arising from having something done, then later it is certain.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a20_18']	若有力能，即彼力能自性隨轉，乃如前說所起作事而得和合。	若有力能，即彼力能自性隨轉，乃如前說所起作事而得和合。	If there is power, then that power itself turns according to its nature, and then the previously mentioned things done are able to combine.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a22_3']	或不隨轉，亦如前說彼無自性，無常因性定不和合。	或不隨轉，亦如前說彼無自性，無常因性定不和合。	Or if it does not turn, it is also as previously explained that it has no self-nature, and the nature of impermanent causes is definitely not combined.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a22_17']	是故諸無常中，無有少法可得。	是故諸無常中，無有少法可得。	Therefore, among all impermanent things, there is not a single dharma that can be obtained.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a23_9']	此中意者，如世尊言：	此中意者，如世尊言：	The meaning here is as the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a23_14']	復次大慧！	復次大慧！	Furthermore, Mahamati!
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a25_16']	不實共相者，所謂虛空、滅、涅槃、無作者，無性、無取者共相，是故無常等生，此不和合而亦非無常。	不實共相者，所謂虛空、滅、涅槃、無作者，無性、無取者共相，是故無常等生，此不和合而亦非無常。	The unreal common characteristic refers to space, cessation, nirvana, the characteristic of no creator, no nature, and no grasper. Therefore, impermanence and so forth arise, but they are not combined and are also not impermanent.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a27_6']	如過去未來二事性中亦非有生而得和合，彼無和合因性隨轉。	如過去未來二事性中亦非有生而得和合，彼無和合因性隨轉。	Just as the two natures of the past and future are also not born and can be combined, their combined causal nature follows and transforms.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a28_10']	若同時生有所相應，亦非同時因所作自性事得決定。	若同時生有所相應，亦非同時因所作自性事得決定。	If there is something to be related when born simultaneously, it is also not simultaneously caused. The nature of things can be determined.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a29_2']	彼同時觀，亦無所成性。	彼同時觀，亦無所成性。	The simultaneous observation also has no nature to be accomplished.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566a29_12']	或異時觀，亦非異時。	或異時觀，亦非異時。	Or the observation at different times is also not at different times.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566b01_8']	若於時中緣中觀者，彼亦不生不實。	若於時中緣中觀者，彼亦不生不實。	If one observes conditions within time, that also does not truly arise.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566b02_16']	過去若生有所和合，而亦非緣亦非有生，彼一切我而亦無緣。	過去若生有所和合，而亦非緣亦非有生，彼一切我而亦無緣。	If the past has something to be combined when born, it is also not a condition and also not born. That is all of the self and also without conditions.
['ZH_T32_1664_002:0566b04_3']	又非一剎那中一切剎那隨入，劫與剎那分量而不和合。	又非一剎那中一切剎那隨入，劫與剎那分量而不和合。	Moreover, in a single instant, all instants do not follow and enter, and eons and instants do not combine.
