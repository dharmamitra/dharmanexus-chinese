['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c09_5']	夫至趣無言、玄藉彌布，法身無像、物感則形，故知無言而無不言、無像而無不像。	夫至趣無言、玄藉彌布，法身無像、物感則形，故知無言而無不言、無像而無不像。	001	The ultimate truth is inexpressible, yet the profound teachings spread everywhere. The Dharma body has no form, yet it manifests in response to beings. Therefore, know that it is inexpressible yet nothing is not expressed, formless yet nothing is not formed.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c10_4']	以無言而無不言，故張大教網、亘生死流；	以無言而無不言，故張大教網、亘生死流；	001	Because it is inexpressible yet nothing is not expressed, the great teaching net is spread across the current of birth and death;
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c11_4']	以無像而無不像，則住如幻智、遊戲六道。	以無像而無不像，則住如幻智、遊戲六道。	001	Because it is formless yet nothing is not formed, one abides in illusory wisdom and plays in the six realms.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c11_13']	是故斯經人法雙舉。	是故斯經人法雙舉。	001	Therefore, this sūtra presents both the person and the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c13_3']	言其人者，所謂淨名，以淨德內充、嘉聲外滿，天下藉甚，故曰淨名。	言其人者，所謂淨名，以淨德內充、嘉聲外滿，天下藉甚，故曰淨名。	001	As for the person, it refers to Vimalakīrti, whose pure virtues are internally fulfilled and his illustrious reputation is externally complete, greatly respected by the world, thus called Vimalakīrti.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c14_14']	豈止降魔勞怨、制諸外道，亦五百聲聞自稱不敏、八千菩薩失對當時。	豈止降魔勞怨、制諸外道，亦五百聲聞自稱不敏、八千菩薩失對當時。	001	How could it be limited to subduing demons and enemies, and restraining non-Buddhists? The five hundred śrāvakas also said they were not capable, and the eight thousand bodhisattvas lost their chance at that time.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c15_7']	所言法者，謂不思議解脫也。	所言法者，謂不思議解脫也。	001	As for the Dharma, it refers to inconceivable liberation.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c16_13']	內無功用、不假思量，外化幽微、物莫能測，謂不思議也。	內無功用、不假思量，外化幽微、物莫能測，謂不思議也。	001	Internally without effort, not relying on thought, externally transforming in the profound, with things unable to be measured, it is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c17_17']	縱任自在、塵累不拘，道貫雙流、二慧常並，謂解脫也。	縱任自在、塵累不拘，道貫雙流、二慧常並，謂解脫也。	001	Freely and at ease, not constrained by dust and troubles, the Way pervades both, with the two wisdoms always parallel, it is called liberation.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c18_15']	余以夫開皇之末，因於身疾，自著玄章；	余以夫開皇之末，因於身疾，自著玄章；	001	In the end of the Kaihuang era, due to my own illness, I composed the Profound Chapters;

['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c19_17']	辭有闊略，致二本不同。	辭有闊略，致二本不同。	001	The words have broad outlines, resulting in the two versions being different.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c22_2']	但斯經是眾聖之靈府、方等之中心，究竟之玄宗、無餘之極說，故諸佛之所諮嗟、弟子之所曉者也。	但斯經是眾聖之靈府、方等之中心，究竟之玄宗、無餘之極說，故諸佛之所諮嗟、弟子之所曉者也。	001	But this sūtra is the spiritual repository of the sages, the central teaching of the Vaipulya, the profound essence of the ultimate, and the ultimate teaching without remainder, thus it is what the buddhas praise and what the disciples understand.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c24_14']	但至趣沖邃、妙契其門，遂使妄執五時謂理猶未滿、或虛談四教稱之為半字，致令無擇起于胸衿、不救出自脣吻。	但至趣沖邃、妙契其門，遂使妄執五時謂理猶未滿、或虛談四教稱之為半字，致令無擇起于胸衿、不救出自脣吻。	001	But those who reach the profound and subtle, who wonderfully accord with its teachings, end up making false claims about the five periods, saying that the principle is still incomplete, or vainly talking about the four teachings, calling them half-words, causing indiscriminate thoughts to arise in their chests and uninhibited speech to come from their lips.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c25_19']	般若信毀之文、法華譬喻之說，盛陳報應，實可塞心。	般若信毀之文、法華譬喻之說，盛陳報應，實可塞心。	001	The passages in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra about faith and slander, and the parables in the Lotus Sūtra, extensively present karmic retribution, which truly can block the mind.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c26_3']	吉藏案：	吉藏案：	001	According to Jizang:
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c27_10']	成實論師開善智藏執於五時，謂此經為第三時抑揚教也。	成實論師開善智藏執於五時，謂此經為第三時抑揚教也。	001	The masters of the Satyasiddhi Śāstra, Kaishan Zhizang, adhere to the five periods, considering this sūtra to be the third period's teaching of suppression and exaltation.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0908c28_15']	招提慧琰用四時教，謂此經是第二時三乘通教攝也。	招提慧琰用四時教，謂此經是第二時三乘通教攝也。	001	Zhaoti Huiyan uses the four-period teaching, considering this sūtra to be included in the second period's teaching common to the three vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a01_19']	雖執三二階差別，同謂此經明果猶是無常，無常辨因未得盡理，故義非極滿教，為半字耳也。	雖執三二階差別，同謂此經明果猶是無常，無常辨因未得盡理，故義非極滿教，為半字耳也。	001	Although they adhere to the distinctions of three and two periods, they both consider the teaching of the effects in this sūtra to still be impermanent. Since the teaching of impermanence in explaining the causes has not yet exhausted the principle, the meaning is not the ultimate and complete teaching, but only half-words.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a03_7']	吉藏謹案誠文，考其得失，宜癈五四之穿鑿、立一極之玄宗也。	吉藏謹案誠文，考其得失，宜癈五四之穿鑿、立一極之玄宗也。	001	I respectfully examine the true texts and investigate their gains and losses. It is appropriate to abandon the five and four kinds of hollow speculations and establish the profound principle of the ultimate one.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a03_20']	此經〈方便品〉云「諸仁者！	此經〈方便品〉云「諸仁者！	001	This sutra's chapter on skillful means says, All of you!
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a04_12']	是身無常甚可患厭，當樂佛身。	是身無常甚可患厭，當樂佛身。	001	This body is impermanent and very much to be abhorred. You should delight in the Buddha's body.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a05_1']	佛身者即法身也。	佛身者即法身也。	001	The Buddha's body is precisely the Dharma body.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a06_17']	」蓋毀生死無常、讚法身常住，令厭茲生死、欣彼法身，則逼引之教成、欣厭之觀立。	」蓋毀生死無常、讚法身常住，令厭茲生死、欣彼法身，則逼引之教成、欣厭之觀立。	001	It is indeed to disparage the impermanence of birth and death and praise the permanence of the Dharma body, to make one abhor this birth and death and delight in that Dharma body, then the teachings of pressure and inducement are accomplished, and the contemplation of delight and abhorrence is established.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a08_2']	若生死無常法身復起滅者，則同可厭棄，何所欣哉？	若生死無常法身復起滅者，則同可厭棄，何所欣哉？	001	If birth and death are impermanent and the Dharma body also arises and ceases, then they are the same in being to be abhorred and discarded. What is there to delight in?
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a09_15']	又說生死無常以破常見、明法身常住斥於斷滅，令遠難二邊、顯于中道。	又說生死無常以破常見、明法身常住斥於斷滅，令遠難二邊、顯于中道。	001	Moreover, it is said that the impermanence of birth and death is to break through the view of permanence, and the permanence of the Dharma body is clarified to refute annihilation. It makes one distance oneself from the two extremes and reveal the middle way.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a11_11']	若生死與法身同無常者，則但斥於常、未破無常，則洗病不周、顯理由未足。	若生死與法身同無常者，則但斥於常、未破無常，則洗病不周、顯理由未足。	001	If birth and death and the Dharma body are the same in being impermanent, then it only disparages permanence and does not yet break through impermanence. Then the washing away of illness is not thorough, and the reason revealed is not yet sufficient.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a13_18']	又說生死無常破凡夫保常之迷、明法身常住斥二乘計斷之執，故非凡夫行、非賢聖行，是菩薩行。	又說生死無常破凡夫保常之迷、明法身常住斥二乘計斷之執，故非凡夫行、非賢聖行，是菩薩行。	001	It also says that the impermanence of birth and death breaks the delusion of ordinary beings who cling to permanence, and clarifies the eternal abiding of the Dharma body to refute the attachment of the two vehicles to the idea of annihilation. Therefore, it is neither the practice of ordinary beings nor the practice of sages, but the practice of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a14_18']	若生死與法身同起滅者，則但超凡，猶未越聖。	若生死與法身同起滅者，則但超凡，猶未越聖。	001	If birth and death arise and cease together with the Dharma body, then one would only transcend the ordinary and still not surpass the sages.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a15_9']	以此詳之，故知常矣。	以此詳之，故知常矣。	001	Examining this in detail, therefore, one knows it is eternal.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a16_6']	二者〈弟子品〉云「佛身無漏，諸漏已盡。	二者〈弟子品〉云「佛身無漏，諸漏已盡。	001	Second, the Chapter on Disciples says, The Buddha's body is free from outflows, and all outflows have already ceased.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a16_16']	佛身無為，不墮諸數。	佛身無為，不墮諸數。	001	The Buddha's body is unconditioned, and does not fall into any categories.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a17_18']	」無漏則五住因傾、無為則二死果盡，蓋辨法身常也。	」無漏則五住因傾、無為則二死果盡，蓋辨法身常也。	001	Being free from outflows means the causes of the five abodes are exhausted, and being unconditioned means the fruits of the two deaths are ended. This clarifies the eternity of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a19_4']	出五濁世，現行斯法度脫眾生，云病須乳，此明應迹無常。	出五濁世，現行斯法度脫眾生，云病須乳，此明應迹無常。	001	Emerging in the world of the five turbidities, manifesting this teaching to deliver sentient beings, saying that one needs milk when sick, this clarifies the impermanence of the responsive traces.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a21_3']	所以開本迹者，以淺識之流取信耳目，於如來身起輕劣想，故彰阿難不達、同彼愚迷。	所以開本迹者，以淺識之流取信耳目，於如來身起輕劣想，故彰阿難不達、同彼愚迷。	001	The reason for revealing the original and the traces is that those with shallow understanding take it to their ears and eyes, and give rise to thoughts of inferiority and weakness regarding the Tathāgata's body. Therefore, it shows that Ānanda did not understand and was the same as those foolish and deluded.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a22_8']	淨名高呵，以開法身之喝，使悟妙本無為、迹有生滅。	淨名高呵，以開法身之喝，使悟妙本無為、迹有生滅。	001	Vimalakīrti's lofty rebuke opens up the roar of the Dharma body, causing one to realize that the wondrous basis is originally unconditioned, while the traces have arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a23_13']	若謂法身猶是無常，則同淺識之昏矇，受淨名之詰責矣。	若謂法身猶是無常，則同淺識之昏矇，受淨名之詰責矣。	001	If one says that the Dharma body is still impermanent, then one is the same as the confused shallow understanding, and one will receive Vimalakīrti's reprimand.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a25_9']	又若未被呵，謂佛無常則迷同淺識，既已聞高責猶執封起滅，則過甚遇矇。	又若未被呵，謂佛無常則迷同淺識，既已聞高責猶執封起滅，則過甚遇矇。	001	Moreover, if one has not yet been rebuked and says that the Buddha is impermanent, then one's delusion is the same as shallow understanding. If one has already heard the lofty rebuke and still clings to conditioned arising and ceasing, then one's mistake is even worse than encountering confusion.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a27_13']	三者〈阿閦佛品〉明法身非有為非無為，即是非常非無常，體絕百非、形備萬德，乃為究竟法身。	三者〈阿閦佛品〉明法身非有為非無為，即是非常非無常，體絕百非、形備萬德，乃為究竟法身。	001	Third, the chapter on Akṣobhya Buddha clarifies that the Dharma body is neither conditioned nor unconditioned, is neither permanent nor impermanent, its essence transcends the hundred negations and its form is replete with myriad virtues, which is the ultimate Dharma body.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a28_4']	常與無常皆是對治之用。	常與無常皆是對治之用。	001	Permanence and impermanence are both expedient uses.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a29_3']	若謂無常，則未達其遍用，何由鑒其圓本？	若謂無常，則未達其遍用，何由鑒其圓本？	001	If one says it is impermanent, then one has not yet penetrated its universal function, how can one examine its perfect basis?
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909a29_15']	以三處計之，則人常義顯。	以三處計之，則人常義顯。	001	If one calculates it in three places, then the meaning of permanence for people becomes evident.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b02_6']	四者〈觀眾生品〉天女章云「但以文字故曰三世，非謂菩提有去來今。	四者〈觀眾生品〉天女章云「但以文字故曰三世，非謂菩提有去來今。	001	Fourth, the chapter on the celestial maiden in the chapter on contemplating sentient beings states: It is only because of written words that it is said to be the three times, not that enlightenment has past, present, or future.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b03_4']	」菩提既超三世，則無相無為，所以常住。	」菩提既超三世，則無相無為，所以常住。	001	Since enlightenment transcends the three times, it is signless and unconditioned, and therefore eternally abiding.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b05_4']	尋如來為能證之人、菩提為所證之法，人法既常則理為究竟，便驗半是虛談、滿為實說。	尋如來為能證之人、菩提為所證之法，人法既常則理為究竟，便驗半是虛談、滿為實說。	001	Investigating the Tathāgata as the person who realizes and enlightenment as the Dharma that is realized, since the person and Dharma are both eternal, the principle becomes ultimate, and it can be verified that half is empty talk and the full is truly spoken.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b05_14']	尋味之徒宜改舊轍也。	尋味之徒宜改舊轍也。	001	Those who savor the teachings should change their old path.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b05_17']	救曰：	救曰：	001	The rescuer says:
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b06_16']	尋夫立義宗者，取淨名室內之說以為正也。	尋夫立義宗者，取淨名室內之說以為正也。	001	Investigating the fundamental purport of establishing the teaching, taking the teachings in Vimalakīrti's room as correct.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b08_8']	前三之文乃為由序，次之一句復是流通，未足證常，不應輒引。	前三之文乃為由序，次之一句復是流通，未足證常，不應輒引。	001	The first three passages are the introduction, and the next sentence is the circulation, insufficient to prove permanence, not to be hastily cited.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b09_8']	故舊轍須依、新宗宜棄開善招提同作此救。	故舊轍須依、新宗宜棄開善招提同作此救。	001	Therefore, the old path must be followed, and the new purport should be abandoned. Kāi Shàn and Zhāo Tí together make this rescue.

['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b11_15']	上所引文則斯經四會，〈方便品〉謂毘耶初集，〈弟子章〉即菴薗始會，天女說謂方丈重集，〈阿閦佛品〉即菴薗再會。	上所引文則斯經四會，〈方便品〉謂毘耶初集，〈弟子章〉即菴薗始會，天女說謂方丈重集，〈阿閦佛品〉即菴薗再會。	001	The above quoted texts are the four assemblies of this sutra. The chapter on skillful means refers to the initial gathering at Vaisali, the chapter on disciples refers to the first assembly at the mango grove, the chapter on the celestial maiden refers to the second gathering at the private room, and the chapter on Akshobhya Buddha refers to the second assembly at the mango grove.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b13_3']	二在室內所談、兩居方丈外說，何得謂前為序分、後是流通也？	二在室內所談、兩居方丈外說，何得謂前為序分、後是流通也？	001	Two were discussed inside the room, and two were spoken outside the private room. How can it be said that the former is the introductory section and the latter is the dissemination?
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b14_7']	又設序明常住、正說起滅，則正淺序深，義成顛倒。	又設序明常住、正說起滅，則正淺序深，義成顛倒。	001	Moreover, if the introduction clarifies the eternal abode and the main teaching arises and ceases, then the main teaching is shallow and the introduction is profound, and the meaning becomes inverted.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b15_8']	又法身常住不可思議，如其起滅，何名莫測？	又法身常住不可思議，如其起滅，何名莫測？	001	Moreover, the eternal abode of the Dharma body is inconceivable. If it arises and ceases, how can it be called unfathomable?
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b15_20']	又若是常住，即教圓理滿。	又若是常住，即教圓理滿。	001	Moreover, if it is eternal, then the teaching is perfect and the principle is complete.

['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b17_1']	若是無常，便非了義。	若是無常，便非了義。	001	If it is impermanent, then it is not the definitive meaning.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b18_4']	稟教之流起輕劣想，進無弘法之功、退有誤物之累。	稟教之流起輕劣想，進無弘法之功、退有誤物之累。	001	Those who receive the teaching will give rise to thoughts of contempt and inferiority, and in advancing there will be no merit in propagating the Dharma, and in retreating there will be the burden of misleading beings.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b18_15']	以文義往推，故知圓極。	以文義往推，故知圓極。	001	Judging from the text and meaning, therefore, it is known to be perfect.

['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b23_5']	但累根匪一，故蕩惑多門，統其要歸凡有二轍：	但累根匪一，故蕩惑多門，統其要歸凡有二轍：	001	But since the accumulated roots are not one, therefore dispelling delusions has many approaches. Summarizing their essential returns, there are generally two tracks:
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b24_5']	一隨小志稱曰小乘、二順大機名為大教。	一隨小志稱曰小乘、二順大機名為大教。	001	One is called the Lesser Vehicle according to the lesser aspiration, the other is called the Great Teaching for those in accord with the great capacity.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b24_15']	但一化終始開為四門：	但一化終始開為四門：	001	But the beginning and end of the one teaching are opened into four approaches:
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b25_15']	一者顯教菩薩、不密化聲聞，即華嚴教也。	一者顯教菩薩、不密化聲聞，即華嚴教也。	001	The first is to manifestly teach bodhisattvas and secretly transform śrāvakas, which is the Huayan teaching.
['ZH_T38_1781_001:0909b26_4']	大機已熟，故顯教之；	大機已熟，故顯教之；	001	Since the great capacity is already mature, therefore they are manifestly taught;
