['ZH_T27_1545_199:0994a12_6']	謗集滅時既撥所斷所證法相。	謗集滅時既撥所斷所證法相。	When one denies the truths of origination and cessation, one annihilates the characteristics of dharmas that are to be eliminated and realized.
['ZH_T27_1545_199:0994a12_15']	若執為道便為無用。	若執為道便為無用。	If one grasps them as the truth of the path, this is useless.
['ZH_T27_1545_199:0994a13_10']	定依所斷及所證法而立道故。	定依所斷及所證法而立道故。	This is because the truth of the path is established on the basis of dharmas that are to be eliminated and realized.
