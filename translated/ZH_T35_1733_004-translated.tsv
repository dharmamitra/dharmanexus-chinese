There is no person or Dharma, etc., therefore it is said to be selfless like a dream.

Since desire and the other seven are all mental factors that are not independent of the mind, it raises the mind as the king to comprehensively answer them, saying only the mind is the master.

['ZH_T35_1733_004:0180b26_9']	然愚夫不了唯心義故，妄隨分別起此欲樂等七種心念。	然愚夫不了唯心義故，妄隨分別起此欲樂等七種心念。	004	However, because foolish people do not understand the meaning of mind-only, they mistakenly follow discrimination and give rise to these seven kinds of mental activities such as desire.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0180b27_1']	以皆取相故，悉是顛倒。	以皆取相故，悉是顛倒。	004	Because they all grasp characteristics, they are all inverted.

Because they quickly cease and do not abide, they are not existent. These two non-dualities are sentient beings, therefore it says there is no different appearance, and therefore they can be taught and transformed.

['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182b24_2', 'ZH_T35_1733_004:0182b25_6']	答意：🔽以教是精進之緣，勤觀扶教方能斷惑，是故速出。	答意： 以教是精進之緣，勤觀扶教方能斷惑，是故速出。	004	The meaning of the answer:🔽Because the teaching is a condition for vigorous effort, diligently contemplating and supporting the teaching can then cut off delusions, and therefore one quickly escapes.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182b26_7']	教有勝力，懈怠乖教則無教力，是故難脫也。	教有勝力，懈怠乖教則無教力，是故難脫也。	004	The teaching has a superior power. If one is lazy and goes against the teaching, then there is no power of the teaching. Therefore, it is difficult to escape.

There are eight verses that clarify laziness in violation of the teaching and explain the gate of difficulty in escaping.

Because he does not understand the meaning of the expedient teaching, he becomes indolent after a long time without attaining [liberation].
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182c14_8']	又此人雖有外緣，竝是錯學之人，妄取倒求，故顛墮也。	又此人雖有外緣，竝是錯學之人，妄取倒求，故顛墮也。	004	Moreover, although this person has external conditions, he is a person who mistakenly studies and falsely grasps inverted practices, so he falls into error.

This person does not know that he lacks the wisdom of hearing, yet he expects to comprehensively understand all Buddhist teachings. Since he cannot understand, he becomes indolent.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182c18_12']	又此人雖外有良緣，內因有闕，謂無信心手、無持戒足，不攣定弓、不茹智箭，云何能射煩惱大地？	又此人雖外有良緣，內因有闕，謂無信心手、無持戒足，不攣定弓、不茹智箭，云何能射煩惱大地？	004	Moreover, although this person has good external conditions, their internal causes are lacking, meaning they lack the hand of faith and the feet of precepts, the unbent bow of concentration, and the unchewed arrow of wisdom. How can they shoot the great earth of afflictions?
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182c20_8']	六少力懈怠喻，是人以剎那意識，則望究盡佛法深海，既不得入便生懈怠。	六少力懈怠喻，是人以剎那意識，則望究盡佛法深海，既不得入便生懈怠。	004	Sixth, the analogy of little strength and laziness - this person, with a momentary consciousness, hopes to thoroughly understand the profound ocean of the Buddha's teachings. Since they cannot enter, they become lazy.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182c21_16']	又聞一念稱佛滅多重罪，但稱一句則休，云我罪已滅等。	又聞一念稱佛滅多重罪，但稱一句則休，云我罪已滅等。	004	Moreover, hearing that chanting the Buddha's name once can eliminate many grave offenses, they only chant a single phrase and then stop, saying My offenses have been eliminated and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182c24_9']	七小治懈怠喻，是人聞佛教能滅煩惱火，則以小聞望盡滅之，久而不盡則謂佛教無用併皆棄捨，故是懈怠。	七小治懈怠喻，是人聞佛教能滅煩惱火，則以小聞望盡滅之，久而不盡則謂佛教無用併皆棄捨，故是懈怠。	004	Seventh, the analogy of small remedies and laziness - this person hears that the Buddha's teachings can extinguish the fire of afflictions, so they hope to extinguish it all with a small amount of learning.

This person hears the teaching that sentient beings are true suchness, but because they do not understand delusion and enlightenment, they say, Since I am already true suchness, I have already realized the Dharma realm, so what else is there to cultivate?

['ZH_T35_1733_004:0182c28_14']	初引佛語舉正義；	初引佛語舉正義；	004	First, citing the Buddha's words to present the correct principle;
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a01_13']	二「云何」下設難顯違，於中初句總、次隨十種垢法是別，恒上心現行，故不離心也；	二「云何」下設難顯違，於中初句總、次隨十種垢法是別，恒上心現行，故不離心也；	004	Second, from How is it? below, setting up difficulties to reveal contradictions. Within this, the first sentence is general, and the following ten kinds of defiled dharmas are specific. They are constantly manifested in the upper mind, so they are not apart from the mind.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a03_3']	三心無所行等是結難反徵，謂雖聞正法，無心依行，而欲斷惑。	三心無所行等是結難反徵，謂雖聞正法，無心依行，而欲斷惑。	004	Third, the mind having no activity, etc., is concluding the difficulty and reversing the investigation. It means that although one hears the correct Dharma, one has no intention to rely on it, yet one wants to sever delusions.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a03_17']	故知佛說聞法能斷，其義何在。	故知佛說聞法能斷，其義何在。	004	Therefore, one should know that the Buddha's teaching of being able to sever delusions by hearing the Dharma, what is the meaning of that?
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a04_1']	又釋：	又釋：	004	Another explanation:
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a04_8']	此是遮救重難。	此是遮救重難。	004	This is a refutation that reiterates the difficulty.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a04_13']	謂若救言：	謂若救言：	004	If one were to rescue by saying:
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a05_12']	若依教行即能斷惑，故聞法能斷義還存者。	若依教行即能斷惑，故聞法能斷義還存者。	004	If one practices according to the teachings, one can then cut off afflictions, so the meaning of being able to cut off afflictions by hearing the Dharma still stands.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a05_17']	今重難云：	今重難云：	004	Now, I will further question this:
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a06_14']	此依教行既是心有所行，何能斷惑？	此依教行既是心有所行，何能斷惑？	004	Since this practice according to the teachings involves the mind engaging in something, how can it cut off afflictions?
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a08_4']	若依道理，要須心無所行方能斷結故，是故聞法終不能斷。	若依道理，要須心無所行方能斷結故，是故聞法終不能斷。	004	If according to principle, one must have the mind not engaging in anything in order to be able to cut off bonds. Therefore, hearing the Dharma ultimately cannot cut off afflictions.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a09_4']	答意則此心無所行名如說行，故能斷結。	答意則此心無所行名如說行，故能斷結。	004	The meaning of the answer is that this mind not engaging in anything is called practicing according to the teachings, and thus can cut off bonds.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a11_5']	若但唯聞，實無斷義，可有聞而不行，無有行而不聞，故曰一切佛法以聞法為本故也。	若但唯聞，實無斷義，可有聞而不行，無有行而不聞，故曰一切佛法以聞法為本故也。	004	If one merely hears [the teachings], there is truly no meaning of cutting off [afflictions]. One can hear [the teachings] without practicing, but there is no practicing without hearing [the teachings]. Therefore, it is said that all Buddha-dharmas take hearing the Dharma as their basis.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a11_16', 'ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a13_3']	此與前正教甚深何別者？🔽前以行徵教難，教力攝行答，謂若無教，勤行不成故。	此與前正教甚深何別者？ 前以行徵教難，教力攝行答，謂若無教，勤行不成故。	004	How is this different from the previous explanation of the profundity of the correct teachings?🔽Previously, it was questioned by using practice to challenge the teachings, and the answer was that the power of the teachings subsumes practice, meaning that if there were no teachings, diligent practice would not be accomplished.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a14_15']	此中以教徵行難，行能行教答，謂若不行，多聞無用故、執教成行故。	此中以教徵行難，行能行教答，謂若不行，多聞無用故、執教成行故。	004	Here, it is questioned by using the teachings to challenge practice, and the answer is that practice can practice the teachings, meaning that if there is no practice, much hearing is useless, and the teachings are upheld as practice.
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a15_4']	法首答也，十偈。	法首答也，十偈。	004	The answer by Dharmaśiras, in ten verses.

['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a23_3']	八廢正成助喻，謂如牛王目比丘誦八萬法聚，永度多億眾得道，自身不免墮地獄等；	八廢正成助喻，謂如牛王目比丘誦八萬法聚，永度多億眾得道，自身不免墮地獄等；	004	the eighth is the analogy of abandoning the correct and accomplishing the auxiliary, referring to the bhikṣu Ox King Eye who recited 80,000 dharmas and eternally liberated many koṭis of beings to attain the Way, but himself could not avoid falling into hell and so forth;
['ZH_T35_1733_004:0183a25_4']	九隱非現是喻，謂如調達善說法，內懷朽爛等，又倚恃此說，非分自高，返為所害等。	九隱非現是喻，謂如調達善說法，內懷朽爛等，又倚恃此說，非分自高，返為所害等。	004	Ninth, the hidden is not manifest, which is a metaphor, such as Devadatta skillfully expounding the Dharma, inwardly harboring decay, etc., and also relying on this explanation, being self-important without reason, and in turn being harmed, etc.

Therefore, this briefly distinguishes the twenty merits that are accomplished.

The wisdom that discriminates the phenomena of objects is precisely the wisdom that observes the non-arising of the sense faculties.
