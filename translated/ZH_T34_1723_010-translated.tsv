['ZH_T34_1723_010:0846c12_3']	陀羅尼救已發心持經者難，令離苦持經。	陀羅尼救已發心持經者難，令離苦持經。	Dharani saves those who have already given rise to the aspiration for enlightenment and uphold the sutra from difficulties and enables them to be free from suffering and uphold the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1723_010:0846c14_5']	又觀音以天眼、天耳、他心三通護持經者難，陀羅尼二聖二天十神以明呪護持經者難。	又觀音以天眼、天耳、他心三通護持經者難，陀羅尼二聖二天十神以明呪護持經者難。	Moreover, Avalokitesvara uses the three spiritual powers of the heavenly eye, heavenly ear, and knowledge of others' minds to protect and uphold the sutra, while dharani and the two sages and two celestials and ten spirits use the power of spells to protect and uphold the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1723_010:0846c15_3']	又觀音念人救難，陀羅尼誦法救難。	又觀音念人救難，陀羅尼誦法救難。	Furthermore, Avalokitesvara uses mindfulness of people to save from difficulties, while dharani uses recitation of the Dharma to save from difficulties.

If one does not add the method of easy rescue, one may fear that it will be difficult to cultivate the practice of upholding the sutra. Therefore, using the merit of easy practice to assist the difficult practice is used to encourage the upholding of the sutra, and thus this chapter comes.
['ZH_T34_1723_010:0846c22_2']	「音」謂音聲有情語業，世間有情起音聲以歸念，菩薩以大悲慧俯觀隨救，名觀世音。	「音」謂音聲有情語業，世間有情起音聲以歸念，菩薩以大悲慧俯觀隨救，名觀世音。	Sound refers to the vocal karma of sentient beings' speech. Sentient beings in the world give rise to sounds with thoughts, and the Bodhisattva, with great compassionate wisdom, looks down and saves according to them, called Observing the Sounds of the World.

Without leisure, the wheel of danger and suffering will be destroyed and pulled out. Acting as an unsolicited friend, being a doctor for those with illnesses, the benefits of attracting [disciples] are inconceivable. It is called Observing the Self-Mastery.

Therefore, it is called the Universal Gate.
['ZH_T34_1723_010:0846c28_15']	神通、記說、教誡三輪，為離苦之處所作入寂之因由，是普門體。	神通、記說、教誡三輪，為離苦之處所作入寂之因由，是普門體。	The three wheels of spiritual powers, prophetic declarations, and admonitions are the place of leaving suffering and the cause of entering tranquility, which is the essence of the Universal Gate.
['ZH_T34_1723_010:0846c30_4']	然有苦者多發聲以歸念，大悲者必應念以臨拯，故名觀音。	然有苦者多發聲以歸念，大悲者必應念以臨拯，故名觀音。	However, those who suffer often cry out in remembrance, and the greatly compassionate one must respond to their remembrance and come to their rescue, thus the name Avalokitêśvara.
