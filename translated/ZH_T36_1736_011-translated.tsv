['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078b20_1']	今此約有體無體，故言廢己。	今此約有體無體，故言廢己。	011	Now this is about having substance and not having substance, so it says negating one's own.

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078b26_11']	三者亦一即多、亦多即一，合上二故，故三句皆是一多相即；	三者亦一即多、亦多即一，合上二故，故三句皆是一多相即；	011	Third, one is identical to many, and many are identical to one, combining the above two, so the three phrases are all one and many being identical to each other;
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078b29_4']	四非一即多、非多即一，亦由一多相即互相奪故，謂由一即多故非多即一、由多即一故非一即多，成俱泯句；	四非一即多、非多即一，亦由一多相即互相奪故，謂由一即多故非多即一、由多即一故非一即多，成俱泯句；	011	Fourth, one is not identical to many, and many are not identical to one, also because one and many are identical to each other and mutually negate each other, that is, because one is identical to many, many are not identical to one, and because many are identical to one, one is not identical to many, forming the phrase of both being negated;
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078c01_1']	五或具前四，以是解境並明照故；	五或具前四，以是解境並明照故；	011	Fifth, or possessing the previous four, because this is the realm of understanding and both are illuminated;

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078c04_12']	若約異類，謂華望剎等，例此可知。	若約異類，謂華望剎等，例此可知。	011	If it is about different categories, such as flowers being identical to buddha lands, etc., it can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078c06_10']	復應例前亦有四句，謂一者一即一、二者一即一切、三一切即一、四一切即一切。	復應例前亦有四句，謂一者一即一、二者一即一切、三一切即一、四一切即一切。	011	Moreover, it should be analogized to the previous [four statements], namely: 1. one is identical to one, 2. one is identical to all, 3. all is identical to one, and 4. all is identical to all.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078c07_3']	以今但約一華，故略不言。	以今但約一華，故略不言。	011	Since here it is only about one flower, it is abbreviated and not mentioned.

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078c09_16']	復或有六，謂前四句後加一即多一、多即一多故。	復或有六，謂前四句後加一即多一、多即一多故。	011	Or there may be six, because after the previous four statements, one is added to many and one, and many are added to one and many.

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078c14_15']	據此，彼相望同體相即，約此體即是一切法故。	據此，彼相望同體相即，約此體即是一切法故。	011	According to this, the mutual identity of the same essence is based on this identity, which is all dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0078c15_7']	若爾，則是託事顯法門。	若爾，則是託事顯法門。	011	If so, then it is the Dharma gate manifested by relying on events.

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c15_17']	如一不成十，二三四等亦不成十，故無十過。	如一不成十，二三四等亦不成十，故無十過。	011	Just as one cannot be ten, two, three, four, etc. also cannot be ten, so there is the fault of not being ten.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c17_2']	二多不成一過，謂若一不成十，此十即不成一。	二多不成一過，謂若一不成十，此十即不成一。	011	Second, the fault of many not being able to be one, meaning that if one cannot be ten, then these ten cannot be one.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c17_14']	由十不成故，一義亦不成。	由十不成故，一義亦不成。	011	Because ten cannot be established, the meaning of one also cannot be established.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c18_6']	以無於十，是誰一故。	以無於十，是誰一故。	011	Because without ten, whose one is it?
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c19_6']	一不即多成過既爾，多不即一成過亦然。	一不即多成過既爾，多不即一成過亦然。	011	The fault of one not being identical to many being established is like this. The fault of many not being identical to one being established is also so.

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c22_9']	疏「一多既爾，多一亦然，反上可知」者，反上一有體，却為一無體。	疏「一多既爾，多一亦然，反上可知」者，反上一有體，却為一無體。	011	The commentary says, If one is like this, many are also so. The opposite can be understood. The opposite of the previous existence of substance becomes the non-existence of substance for one.

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c26_17']	言「有體無體」者，有體即前一是能起，故有體也。	言「有體無體」者，有體即前一是能起，故有體也。	011	As for having substance and not having substance, having substance refers to the previous one being able to arise, so it has substance.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c27_17']	無體者，即前舉例中多一亦然，明一無體也。	無體者，即前舉例中多一亦然，明一無體也。	011	As for not having substance, it refers to the many in the previous raised example, and one is also like this, clarifying that one does not have substance.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c28_18']	「故能攝他同己」者，成上一有體，攝他多也。	「故能攝他同己」者，成上一有體，攝他多也。	011	Therefore, it can include others and make them the same as itself means accomplishing the previous having substance and including the many others.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0084c29_8']	即前無有不一之多耳。	即前無有不一之多耳。	011	It is simply the previous absence of a many that is not one.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0085a01_4']	「廢己同他」者，成前一無體也。	「廢己同他」者，成前一無體也。	011	Abandoning itself and making it the same as others means accomplishing the previous one not having substance.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0085a02_7']	故廢己一同他多也，即前無有不多之一耳。	故廢己一同他多也，即前無有不多之一耳。	011	Therefore, it abandons itself and makes it the same as the many others. It is simply the previous absence of a one that is not many.
['ZH_T36_1736_011:0085a04_3']	雖有有體無體二義，皆屬一望於多，故云「攝他同己、廢己同他」。	雖有有體無體二義，皆屬一望於多，故云「攝他同己、廢己同他」。	011	Although there are two meanings of having substance and not having substance, they are all attributed to one in relation to many, so it is said that subsuming others as the same as oneself and abandoning oneself as the same as others.

['ZH_T36_1736_011:0085a13_7']	雙泯者，以一望於多二義，即是多望於一二義故，則一望於多二義泯矣。	雙泯者，以一望於多二義，即是多望於一二義故，則一望於多二義泯矣。	011	As for the mutual obliteration, the two meanings of one in relation to many are the same as the two meanings of many in relation to one and two, so the two meanings of one in relation to many are obliterated.
