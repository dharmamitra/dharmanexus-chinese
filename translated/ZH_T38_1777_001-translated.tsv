['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a18_8']	第一、通標五義名者，此經以不思議人、法為「名」，不思議真性解脫為「體」，不思議佛國因果為「宗」，不思議權實折伏、攝受為「用」，不思議帶偏顯圓為「教相」。	第一、通標五義名者，此經以不思議人、法為「名」，不思議真性解脫為「體」，不思議佛國因果為「宗」，不思議權實折伏、攝受為「用」，不思議帶偏顯圓為「教相」。	First, the general indication of the five meanings of the name: this sūtra takes the inconceivable person and Dharma as its name, the inconceivable true nature of liberation as its essence, the inconceivable cause and effect of the Buddha's land as its purpose, the inconceivable skillful means of subduing and attracting as its function, and the inconceivable revealing of the perfect by means of the biased as its teaching characteristics.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a19_15']	故今明此經，始從「如是我聞……」，終乎「歡喜奉行」，皆明不思議也。	故今明此經，始從「如是我聞……」，終乎「歡喜奉行」，皆明不思議也。	Therefore, in explaining this sūtra, from Thus have I heard... to joyfully accepting and practicing, all expound the inconceivable.

['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a22_3']	雖理絕名言，非名言無以設教，故於無名之道假名相說，而名以召法，法以應名。	雖理絕名言，非名言無以設教，故於無名之道假名相說，而名以召法，法以應名。	Although principle transcends names and words, without names and words there is no way to establish the teachings. Therefore, in the nameless Way, names and appearances are provisionally used to call the Dharma, and the Dharma responds to the names.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a22_22']	是以經之指歸，蘊在名內，故先「標名」。	是以經之指歸，蘊在名內，故先「標名」。	Therefore, the ultimate point of the sūtra is contained within the names, so the names are listed first.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a24_10']	夫尋名得理，理即真性解脫，真性解脫即經之體也，故次「出體」。	夫尋名得理，理即真性解脫，真性解脫即經之體也，故次「出體」。	Seeking the principle through names, the principle is true nature liberation, and true nature liberation is the essence of the sūtra, therefore, the essence is explained next.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a24_20']	體不孤致，求之有方；	體不孤致，求之有方；	The essence is not achieved alone, it is sought through methods;
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a26_12']	涉行修因，然後致果，故用佛國因果為入理綱宗，提綱目動，故次「明宗」也。	涉行修因，然後致果，故用佛國因果為入理綱宗，提綱目動，故次「明宗」也。	Engaging in practice and cultivating causes, one then attains the fruition, therefore, the cause and effect of the Buddha land are used as the main principle for entering the principle. Pulling the main rope moves the eyes, therefore, the main principle is explained next.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a27_22']	行因趣果，得果即能巧用權實，折伏、攝受利益眾生，故次「明用」也。	行因趣果，得果即能巧用權實，折伏、攝受利益眾生，故次「明用」也。	Cultivating causes and seeking fruition, attaining the fruition one is able to skillfully employ the provisional and actual, subduing and embracing to benefit sentient beings, therefore, the function is explained next.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519a29_10']	聖人設教，隨逗機緣，機緣不一，是以教有異同，故次明「教相」也。	聖人設教，隨逗機緣，機緣不一，是以教有異同，故次明「教相」也。	The sage establishes teachings in accordance with the capacities of beings, since capacities are not uniform, the teachings have differences and similarities, therefore, the characteristics of the teachings are explained next.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b01_6']	第三、引證者：	第三、引證者：	Third, the corroboration:
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b03_3']	〈囑累品〉云「此經名『維摩詰所說』，亦名『不可思議解脫法門』」，此即人、法雙題共標名也。	〈囑累品〉云「此經名『維摩詰所說』，亦名『不可思議解脫法門』」，此即人、法雙題共標名也。	The chapter on entrustment says, This sūtra is named 'Spoken by Vimalakīrti', and is also named 'The Dharma Door of Inconceivable Liberation', this is a dual title of person and dharma jointly indicating the name.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b04_9']	〈觀眾生品〉云「佛為增上慢人，說離婬、怒、癡，名為解脫耳。	〈觀眾生品〉云「佛為增上慢人，說離婬、怒、癡，名為解脫耳。	The Chapter on Contemplating Sentient Beings says, The Buddha tells those with arrogance that separating from desire, anger, and ignorance is called liberation.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b06_4']	若無增上慢人，佛說婬、怒、癡性，即是解脫」，婬、怒、癡性，即不思議真性解脫為體也。	若無增上慢人，佛說婬、怒、癡性，即是解脫」，婬、怒、癡性，即不思議真性解脫為體也。	If there were no one with arrogance, the Buddha would say that the nature of desire, anger, and ignorance is itself liberation. The nature of desire, anger, and ignorance is the essence of inconceivable true liberation.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b06_22']	又，〈佛國品〉明寶積獻蓋，請問淨土；	又，〈佛國品〉明寶積獻蓋，請問淨土；	Moreover, the Chapter on the Buddha Land clarifies that Baoji offered a canopy and asked about the Pure Land;

Therefore, we know that the expedient and true teachings of this person and the Dharma subdue and accept, which is the function of the sutra.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b12_4']	教相者，通明此經與諸經教相有同異，故須判教相也。	教相者，通明此經與諸經教相有同異，故須判教相也。	As for the characteristics of the teachings, it comprehensively clarifies the similarities and differences between this sūtra and the teachings of other sūtras, and therefore it is necessary to discern the characteristics of the teachings.

['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b18_11']	人是別總，三義是總別，是則總總於別，別別於總也。	人是別總，三義是總別，是則總總於別，別別於總也。	The person is the general of the specific, and the three meanings are the specific of the general. This means that the general is the general of the specific, and the specific is the specific of the general.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b19_4']	所以然者，人名淨、無垢、稱。	所以然者，人名淨、無垢、稱。	The reason for this is that the person's name is Pure, Stainless, and Renowned.
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b19_20']	「淨」即真性，真性清淨即是體也；	「淨」即真性，真性清淨即是體也；	Pure is the true nature, and the pure true nature is precisely the essence;
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b20_12']	「無垢」即實慧，實慧因果即是經宗；	「無垢」即實慧，實慧因果即是經宗；	Impurity refers to true wisdom, and the cause and effect of true wisdom are the main purport of the sūtra;
['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b21_4']	「稱」即方便巧能，即是經用。	「稱」即方便巧能，即是經用。	Praise refers to skillful means, which is the function of the sūtra.

['ZH_T38_1777_001:0519b23_12']	此義虛玄，恐未明了，今借近喻，以暢滯情。	此義虛玄，恐未明了，今借近喻，以暢滯情。	This meaning is profound and empty, fearing that it is not yet clear. Now borrowing a nearby analogy to express the stagnant emotions.
