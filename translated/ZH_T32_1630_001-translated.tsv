['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b10_19']	異品者，謂於是處無其所立，「若有是常，見非所作，如虛空等」。	異品者，謂於是處無其所立，「若有是常，見非所作，如虛空等」。	The dissimilar class refers to those cases where the thesis is absent. If something is permanent, it is seen to be not produced, like space and so on.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b11_17']	此中所作性或勤勇無間所發性，遍是宗法性。	此中所作性或勤勇無間所發性，遍是宗法性。	Here, the nature of being produced or the nature of being produced immediately after exertion is the nature of the property of the thesis.

The different method.🔽The same method refers to those cases where the presence of the reason in the similar class is shown, such as Whatever is produced is seen to be impermanent, like pots and so on.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b17_3']	異法者，若於是處說所立無，因遍非有，謂「若是常，見非所作，如虛空等」。	異法者，若於是處說所立無，因遍非有，謂「若是常，見非所作，如虛空等」。	The different method refers to those cases where the absence of the thesis is stated and the reason is completely absent, such as If something is permanent, it is seen to be not produced, like space and so on.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b18_15']	此中「常」言表「非無常」，「非所作」言表「無所作」，如有非有，說名「非有」。	此中「常」言表「非無常」，「非所作」言表「無所作」，如有非有，說名「非有」。	Here, the word permanent expresses not impermanent, and the word not produced expresses not produced, just as non-existent is said to be not existent.

['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b23_6']	「若是其常，見非所作，如虛空」者，是遠離言。	「若是其常，見非所作，如虛空」者，是遠離言。	If it is permanent, we see it is not produced, like space is the statement of the dissimilar instance.

['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b24_18']	雖樂成立，由與現量等相違故，名似立宗。	雖樂成立，由與現量等相違故，名似立宗。	Although one wishes to establish [the thesis], because it contradicts direct perception and so forth, it is called a pseudo-thesis.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b27_6']	謂現量相違、比量相違、自教相違、世間相違、自語相違、能別不極成、所別不極成、俱不極成、相符極成。	謂現量相違、比量相違、自教相違、世間相違、自語相違、能別不極成、所別不極成、俱不極成、相符極成。	Namely, contradiction with direct perception, contradiction with inference, contradiction with one's own teachings, contradiction with the world, contradiction with one's own words, the probandum not being established for the probans, the probandum not being established for the probandi, both not being established, and the probans being established as the same as the probandum.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b28_3']	此中現量相違者，如說「聲非所聞」。	此中現量相違者，如說「聲非所聞」。	Among them, contradiction with direct perception is like saying sound is not audible.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b28_18']	比量相違者，如說「瓶等是常」。	比量相違者，如說「瓶等是常」。	Contradiction with inference is like saying pots, etc. are permanent.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011b29_13']	自教相違者，如勝論師立「聲為常」。	自教相違者，如勝論師立「聲為常」。	Contradiction with one's own teachings is like the Sāṃkhya school positing sound is permanent.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c02_9']	世間相違者，如說「懷兔非月，有故」，又如說言「人頂骨淨，眾生分故，猶如螺貝」。	世間相違者，如說「懷兔非月，有故」，又如說言「人頂骨淨，眾生分故，猶如螺貝」。	Contradiction with the world is like saying the rabbit-holding [object] is not the moon, because it exists, and also like saying the top of a person's head is pure, because it is a part of a living being, just like a conch shell.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c03_5']	自語相違者，如言「我母是其石女」。	自語相違者，如言「我母是其石女」。	Contradiction with one's own words is like saying my mother is a barren woman.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c04_7']	能別不極成者，如佛弟子對數論師立「聲滅壞」。	能別不極成者，如佛弟子對數論師立「聲滅壞」。	The probandum not being established for the probans is like the Buddhist disciples positing sound is perishable to the Sāṃkhya school.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c05_9']	所別不極成者，如數論師對佛弟子說「我是思」。	所別不極成者，如數論師對佛弟子說「我是思」。	As for the subject not being established, it is like the Sāṃkhya master arguing against the Buddhist disciple, saying I am consciousness.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c06_14']	俱不極成者，如勝論師對佛弟子立「我以為和合因緣」。	俱不極成者，如勝論師對佛弟子立「我以為和合因緣」。	As for both [subject and reason] not being established, it is like the Vaiśeṣika arguing against the Buddhist disciple, establishing I as the cause and condition of combination.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c07_10']	相符極成者，如說「聲是所聞」。	相符極成者，如說「聲是所聞」。	As for the reason being contradictory, it is like saying sound is audible.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c08_19']	如是多言，是遣諸法自相門故、不容成故、立無果故，名似立宗過。	如是多言，是遣諸法自相門故、不容成故、立無果故，名似立宗過。	Thus, many statements are called fallacious theses because they eliminate the intrinsic characteristics of dharmas, because they do not allow establishment, and because they establish nothing.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c09_9']	已說似宗，當說似因。	已說似宗，當說似因。	Having explained the fallacious theses, we will now discuss the fallacious reasons.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c10_4']	不成、不定及與相違，是名似因。	不成、不定及與相違，是名似因。	The fallacious reasons are called unproven, uncertain, and contradictory.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c11_4']	不成有四：	不成有四：	There are four types of unproven reasons:🔽1. Both-unproven;

['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c13_14']	如成立「聲為無常」等，若言「是眼所見性故」，兩俱不成。	如成立「聲為無常」等，若言「是眼所見性故」，兩俱不成。	For example, in establishing that sound is impermanent, if one says because it has the nature of being seen by the eyes, it is both-unproven.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c14_8']	「所作性故」，對聲顯論，隨一不成。	「所作性故」，對聲顯論，隨一不成。	Because of the nature of what is produced, in response to the theory that sound is manifest, it is not established as one of the two.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c15_18']	於霧等性起疑惑時，為成「大種和合火有」而有所說，猶豫不成。	於霧等性起疑惑時，為成「大種和合火有」而有所說，猶豫不成。	When doubt arises regarding the nature of fog and so forth, in order to establish that fire exists as a combination of the great elements, what is said is not established due to doubt.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c16_19']	「虛空實有，德所依故」，對無空論，所依不成。	「虛空實有，德所依故」，對無空論，所依不成。	Space truly exists because it is the basis of qualities, in response to the theory that space does not exist, the basis is not established.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c17_4']	不定有六：	不定有六：	There are six kinds of indeterminate [reasons]:
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c17_8']	一、共；	一、共；	1. Common;

['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c18_2']	三、同品一分轉異品遍轉；	三、同品一分轉異品遍轉；	3. Occurring in part of the similar instance and occurring everywhere in the dissimilar instance;
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c18_14']	四、異品一分轉同品遍轉；	四、異品一分轉同品遍轉；	4. Occurring in part of the dissimilar instance and occurring everywhere in the similar instance;
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c19_1']	五、俱品一分轉；	五、俱品一分轉；	5. Occurring in part of both the similar and dissimilar instances;
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c19_8']	六、相違決定。	六、相違決定。	6. Contradictory and definite.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c20_3']	此中共者，如言「聲常，所量性故」。	此中共者，如言「聲常，所量性故」。	As for the common [reason], it is like saying Sound is permanent because it is what is measured.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c20_17', 'ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c21_11']	常無常品皆共此因，是故不定。🔽為如瓶等所量性故，聲是無常？	常無常品皆共此因，是故不定。 為如瓶等所量性故，聲是無常？	Both the category of permanent and impermanent [things] share this reason, and therefore it is indeterminate.🔽Is it like sound, which is impermanent because it is what is measured, like a pot and so forth?
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c22_7']	為如空等所量性故，聲是其常？	為如空等所量性故，聲是其常？	Or is it like sound, which is permanent because it is what is measured, like space and so forth?
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c24_6']	言不共者，如說「聲常，所聞性故」，常無常品皆離此因，常無常外餘非有故，是猶豫因。	言不共者，如說「聲常，所聞性故」，常無常品皆離此因，常無常外餘非有故，是猶豫因。	As for the uncommon, it is like saying Sound is eternal, because it has the nature of being heard. Both the eternal and non-eternal categories are devoid of this reason. Because apart from the eternal and non-eternal, there is no other existence, it is a reason of doubt.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c24_16']	此所聞性，其猶何等？	此所聞性，其猶何等？	What is this nature of being heard like?
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c26_5']	同品一分轉異品遍轉者，如說「聲非勤勇無間所發，無常性故」。	同品一分轉異品遍轉者，如說「聲非勤勇無間所發，無常性故」。	The second type of inconclusive reason is one that partially occurs in the similar instance and universally occurs in the dissimilar instance. For example, Sound is not produced by the exertion of effort, because it is impermanent.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c27_5']	此中非勤勇無間所發宗，以電空等為其同品。	此中非勤勇無間所發宗，以電空等為其同品。	Here, the proposition that sound is not produced by the exertion of effort takes lightning, space, etc. as its similar instances.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c28_1']	此無常性，於電等有、於空等無。	此無常性，於電等有、於空等無。	This impermanence exists in lightning, etc. but does not exist in space, etc.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0011c29_3']	非勤勇無間所發宗，以瓶等為異品，於彼遍有。	非勤勇無間所發宗，以瓶等為異品，於彼遍有。	The proposition that sound is not produced by the exertion of effort takes vases, etc. as its dissimilar instances, where it exists universally.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a01_2', 'ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a02_1']	此因以電、瓶等為同法故，亦是不定。🔽為如瓶等無常性故，彼是勤勇無間所發？	此因以電、瓶等為同法故，亦是不定。 為如瓶等無常性故，彼是勤勇無間所發？	This reason, because it takes lightning, vases, etc. as its similar instances, is also inconclusive.🔽Is it like vases, etc., because of their impermanence, that they are produced by the exertion of effort?
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a03_1']	為如電等無常性故，彼非勤勇無間所發？	為如電等無常性故，彼非勤勇無間所發？	Or is it like lightning, etc., because of their impermanence, that they are not produced by the exertion of effort?
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a04_13']	異品一分轉同品遍轉者，如立宗言「聲是勤勇無間所發，無常性故」。	異品一分轉同品遍轉者，如立宗言「聲是勤勇無間所發，無常性故」。	The second type of inconclusive reason is one that is present in part of the similar instances and in all of the dissimilar instances. For example, the thesis is stated as Sound is produced by the exertion of effort, because it is impermanent.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a05_17']	勤勇無間所發宗，以瓶等為同品，其無常性於此遍有；	勤勇無間所發宗，以瓶等為同品，其無常性於此遍有；	The thesis that sound is produced by the exertion of effort takes vases, etc. as similar instances, and impermanence is present in all of them.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a07_2']	以電空等為異品，於彼一分電等是有、空等是無。	以電空等為異品，於彼一分電等是有、空等是無。	It takes lightning, space, etc. as dissimilar instances, and lightning, etc. are present in part of them, while space, etc. are absent.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a07_12']	是故如前，亦為不定。	是故如前，亦為不定。	Therefore, like the previous [type of inconclusive reason], this is also inconclusive.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a08_11']	俱品一分轉者，如說「聲常，無質礙故」。	俱品一分轉者，如說「聲常，無質礙故」。	The third type of inconclusive reason is one that is present in part of both the similar and dissimilar instances. For example, it is said that Sound is permanent, because it is without obstruction.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a10_3']	此中常宗，以虛空極微等為同品，無質礙性於虛空等有、於極微等無；	此中常宗，以虛空極微等為同品，無質礙性於虛空等有、於極微等無；	Here, the thesis that sound is permanent takes space, atoms, etc. as similar instances, and being without obstruction is present in space, etc. but absent in atoms, etc.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a11_3']	以瓶樂等為異品，於樂等有、於瓶等無。	以瓶樂等為異品，於樂等有、於瓶等無。	It takes vases, pleasure, etc. as dissimilar instances, and it is present in pleasure, etc. but absent in vases, etc.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a12_3']	是故此因，以樂以空為同法故，亦名不定。	是故此因，以樂以空為同法故，亦名不定。	Therefore, this reason is also called inconclusive because it takes pleasure and space as similar instances.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a13_10']	相違決定者，如立宗言「聲是無常，所作性故，譬如瓶等」；	相違決定者，如立宗言「聲是無常，所作性故，譬如瓶等」；	Contradictory inconclusive means, for example, positing a thesis statement Sound is impermanent, because it is produced, like a pot, etc.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a14_5']	有立「聲常，所聞性故，譬如聲性」。	有立「聲常，所聞性故，譬如聲性」。	Some posit Sound is permanent, because it is audible, like sound itself.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a14_19']	此二皆是猶豫因故，俱名不定。	此二皆是猶豫因故，俱名不定。	Both of these are inconclusive reasons, so they are both called inconclusive.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a15_4']	相違有四：	相違有四：	There are four kinds of contradictions:
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a16_18']	謂法自性相違因、法差別相違因、有法自相相違因、有法差別相違因等。	謂法自性相違因、法差別相違因、有法自相相違因、有法差別相違因等。	Namely, reasons contradicting the intrinsic nature of a dharma, reasons contradicting the distinctions of a dharma, reasons contradicting the intrinsic characteristics of an existent dharma, and reasons contradicting the distinctions of an existent dharma.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a18_9']	此中，法自相相違因者，如說「聲常，所作性故，或勤勇無間所發性故」。	此中，法自相相違因者，如說「聲常，所作性故，或勤勇無間所發性故」。	Among them, reasons contradicting the intrinsic characteristics of a dharma means, for example, saying Sound is permanent, because it is produced, or because it is produced immediately after effort.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a19_4']	此因唯於異品中有，是故相違。	此因唯於異品中有，是故相違。	This reason only exists in dissimilar instances, and therefore contradicts.
['ZH_T32_1630_001:0012a20_13']	法差別相違因者，如說「眼等必為他用，積聚性故，如臥具等」。	法差別相違因者，如說「眼等必為他用，積聚性故，如臥具等」。	Reasons contradicting the distinctions of a dharma means, for example, saying The eye, etc. must be used by others, because they are accumulations, like bedding, etc.
