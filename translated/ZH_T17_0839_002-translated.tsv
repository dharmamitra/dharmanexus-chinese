['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a02_12']	若有眾生欲向大乘者，應當先知最初所行根本之業。	若有眾生欲向大乘者，應當先知最初所行根本之業。	If there are sentient beings who wish to enter the Great Vehicle, they should first understand the fundamental practices that are initially undertaken.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a04_16']	其最初所行根本業者，所謂依止一實境界以修信解，因信解力增長故，速疾得入菩薩種性。	其最初所行根本業者，所謂依止一實境界以修信解，因信解力增長故，速疾得入菩薩種性。	As for the fundamental practices that are initially undertaken, they are called relying on the one true realm to cultivate faith and understanding. Because the power of faith and understanding increases, one quickly enters the bodhisattva lineage.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a06_16']	所言一實境界者，謂眾生心體，從本以來，不生不滅，自性清淨，無障無礙，猶如虛空。	所言一實境界者，謂眾生心體，從本以來，不生不滅，自性清淨，無障無礙，猶如虛空。	As for the one true realm, it refers to the essence of the mind of sentient beings, which from the very beginning is unborn and unceasing, intrinsically pure, unobstructed, and unimpeded, just like empty space.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a08_13']	離分別故，平等普遍，無所不至，圓滿十方，究竟一相，無二無別，不變不異，無增無減。	離分別故，平等普遍，無所不至，圓滿十方，究竟一相，無二無別，不變不異，無增無減。	Because it is free from discrimination, it is equal and pervasive, reaching everywhere, perfectly filling the ten directions, ultimately one in essence, without duality or distinction, unchanging and immutable, without increase or decrease.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a10_16']	以一切眾生心，一切聲聞、辟支佛心，一切菩薩心，一切諸佛心，皆同不生不滅，無染寂靜，真如相故。	以一切眾生心，一切聲聞、辟支佛心，一切菩薩心，一切諸佛心，皆同不生不滅，無染寂靜，真如相故。	Because the minds of all sentient beings, the minds of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, the minds of all bodhisattvas, and the minds of all buddhas are all the same in being unborn and unceasing, free from defilements and tranquil, with the characteristic of suchness.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a11_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a12_1']	一切有心起分別者，猶如幻化，無有定實。	一切有心起分別者，猶如幻化，無有定實。	All minds that give rise to discrimination are like magical illusions, without any fixed reality.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a14_7']	所謂識、受、想、行、憶念、緣慮、覺知等，種種心數，非青非黃，非赤非白，亦非雜色，無有長短、方圓、大小。	所謂識、受、想、行、憶念、緣慮、覺知等，種種心數，非青非黃，非赤非白，亦非雜色，無有長短、方圓、大小。	That is to say, consciousness, sensation, conception, volition, memory, attention, awareness, and other mental factors are neither blue, yellow, red, nor white, nor are they a mixture of colors, nor do they have length or shortness, squareness or roundness, size or magnitude.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a15_13']	乃至盡於十方虛空一切世界，求心形狀，無一區分而可得者。	乃至盡於十方虛空一切世界，求心形狀，無一區分而可得者。	Even if one searches throughout the ten directions, throughout the entire realm of space, for the shape and form of the mind, not even a single part can be found.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a16_17']	但以眾生無明癡闇熏習因緣，現妄境界，令生念著。	但以眾生無明癡闇熏習因緣，現妄境界，令生念著。	It is only due to the causes and conditions of the deluded and ignorant mind of sentient beings, which manifests false objects and gives rise to thoughts and attachments.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a18_10']	所謂此心不能自知，妄自謂有，起覺知想，計我、我所，而實無有覺知之想。	所謂此心不能自知，妄自謂有，起覺知想，計我、我所，而實無有覺知之想。	That is to say, this mind cannot know itself, and falsely thinks that there is awareness, giving rise to the notion of knowing. It calculates the self and what belongs to the self, but in reality there is no notion of knowing.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a19_4']	以此妄心畢竟無體，不可見故。	以此妄心畢竟無體，不可見故。	Because this deluded mind is ultimately without substance and cannot be seen.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a20_9']	若無覺知能分別者，則無十方三世一切境界差別之相。	若無覺知能分別者，則無十方三世一切境界差別之相。	If there is no awareness that can discriminate, then there are no distinctions in the realms of the ten directions and three times.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a21_10']	以一切法皆不能自有，但依妄心分別故有。	以一切法皆不能自有，但依妄心分別故有。	Because all dharmas are unable to exist by themselves, they exist only because of the discriminating mind.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a22_17']	所謂一切境界，各各不同，自念為有，知此為自，知彼為他。	所謂一切境界，各各不同，自念為有，知此為自，知彼為他。	That is to say, all realms are different from each other. One's own thoughts are considered to exist. Knowing this is one's own. Knowing that is others'.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a23_12']	是故一切法不能自有，則無別異。	是故一切法不能自有，則無別異。	Therefore, all dharmas are unable to exist by themselves, and there are no distinctions.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a26_10']	唯依妄心，不知不了內自無故，謂有前外境界，妄生種種法想，謂有謂無，謂彼謂此，謂是謂非，謂好謂惡，乃至妄生無量無邊法想。	唯依妄心，不知不了內自無故，謂有前外境界，妄生種種法想，謂有謂無，謂彼謂此，謂是謂非，謂好謂惡，乃至妄生無量無邊法想。	It only relies on the deluded mind, not knowing or understanding that internally there is nothing, and thus it takes the external objects in front to be existent, giving rise to various conceptual thoughts about dharmas, thinking they exist or do not exist, are so or not so, are good or bad, and even giving rise to immeasurable conceptual thoughts about dharmas.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a27_13']	當如是知，一切諸法，皆從妄想生，依妄心為本。	當如是知，一切諸法，皆從妄想生，依妄心為本。	One should know that all dharmas arise from false conceptualization and are based on the deluded mind as their root.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907a29_6']	「然此妄心無自相故，亦依境界而有，所謂緣念覺知前境界故，說名為心。	「然此妄心無自相故，亦依境界而有，所謂緣念覺知前境界故，說名為心。	However, this deluded mind has no self-nature, and thus it also exists in dependence on objects. It is called mind because it conditions, recollects, awakens to, and cognizes the objects in front.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b01_17']	又此妄心與前境界，雖俱相依，起無先後，而此妄心能為一切境界原主。	又此妄心與前境界，雖俱相依，起無先後，而此妄心能為一切境界原主。	Moreover, although this deluded mind and the objects in front both arise in dependence on each other without a fixed sequence, this deluded mind can be the original source of all objects.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b02_3']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b03_2']	謂依妄心，不了法界一相故，說心有無明。	謂依妄心，不了法界一相故，說心有無明。	It is because in dependence on the deluded mind, one does not understand the one characteristic of the dharma realm, and thus it is said that the mind has ignorance.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b03_14']	依無明力因故，現妄境界。	依無明力因故，現妄境界。	It is because of the power of ignorance as a cause that deluded objects appear.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b04_14']	亦依無明滅故，一切境界滅，非依一切境界。	亦依無明滅故，一切境界滅，非依一切境界。	It is also based on the cessation of ignorance that all objects cease, not based on all objects.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b05_3']	自不了故，說境界有。	自不了故，說境界有。	Because of not understanding by oneself, it is said that objects exist.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b05_17']	無明亦非依境界故，生於無明。	無明亦非依境界故，生於無明。	Ignorance is also not produced based on objects.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b06_14']	以一切諸佛，於一切境界不生無明故。	以一切諸佛，於一切境界不生無明故。	Because all Buddhas do not give rise to ignorance regarding all objects.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b07_9']	又復不依境界滅故，無明心滅。	又復不依境界滅故，無明心滅。	Moreover, it is not based on the cessation of objects that the mind of ignorance ceases.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b08_9']	以一切境界，從本已來，體性自滅，未曾有故。	以一切境界，從本已來，體性自滅，未曾有故。	Because all objects, from the very beginning, have a nature that is inherently extinguished, and have never existed.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b09_7']	因如此義，是故但說一切諸法依心為本。	因如此義，是故但說一切諸法依心為本。	For this reason, it is said that all dharmas are based on the mind as their root.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b10_12']	當知一切諸法，悉名為心，以義、體不異，為心所攝故。	當知一切諸法，悉名為心，以義、體不異，為心所攝故。	One should know that all dharmas are called the mind, because in meaning and essence they are not different, and are subsumed by the mind.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b12_1']	又一切諸法，從心所起，與心作相，和合而有，共生共滅，同無有住。	又一切諸法，從心所起，與心作相，和合而有，共生共滅，同無有住。	Moreover, all dharmas arise from the mind, serve as the characteristics of the mind, exist in combination, are born together and cease together, and are the same in having no abiding.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b13_8']	以一切境界，但隨心所緣，念念相續故，而得住持，暫時為有。	以一切境界，但隨心所緣，念念相續故，而得住持，暫時為有。	Because all objects are only in accordance with the mind's objects, and continue in succession from moment to moment, they can be maintained and temporarily exist.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b14_1']	「如是所說心義者，有二種相。	「如是所說心義者，有二種相。	As for the meaning of mind that is explained like this, there are two kinds of characteristics.

['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b14_18']	一者心內相，二者心外相。	一者心內相，二者心外相。	First, the internal characteristics of the mind; second, the external characteristics of the mind.

['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b15_20']	一者真，二者妄。	一者真，二者妄。	First, the true; second, the false.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b18_8']	所言真者，謂心體本相，如如不異，清淨圓滿，無障無礙，微密難見，以遍一切處，常恒不壞，建立生長一切法故。	所言真者，謂心體本相，如如不異，清淨圓滿，無障無礙，微密難見，以遍一切處，常恒不壞，建立生長一切法故。	As for the true, it refers to the mind's fundamental characteristics, such as suchness without difference, purity and perfection, unobstructed and unimpeded, subtle and difficult to see, because it pervades everywhere, is always indestructible, and establishes and nurtures all dharmas.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b20_19']	所言妄者，謂起念、分別、覺知、緣慮、憶想等事，雖復相續，能生一切種種境界，而內虛偽，無有真實，不可見故。	所言妄者，謂起念、分別、覺知、緣慮、憶想等事，雖復相續，能生一切種種境界，而內虛偽，無有真實，不可見故。	As for the false, it refers to the activities of thought, discrimination, cognition, conceptualization, memory, and so forth. Although they continue in succession and can give rise to all kinds of objects, they are internally false and deceptive, without any reality, because they cannot be seen.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b22_18']	所言心外相者，謂一切諸法種種境界等，隨有所念，境界現前故，知有內心及外心差別。	所言心外相者，謂一切諸法種種境界等，隨有所念，境界現前故，知有內心及外心差別。	As for the external characteristics, they refer to all kinds of phenomena and various realms, etc. Since the objects of thought appear before one, one knows that there is an internal mind and external mind with distinctions.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b23_13']	如是當知，內妄想者，為因為體。	如是當知，內妄想者，為因為體。	Thus, one should know that the internal deluded thoughts are the cause and essence.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b24_2']	外妄相者，為果為用。	外妄相者，為果為用。	The external deluded characteristics are the effect and function.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b25_2']	依如此等義，是故我說一切諸法悉名為心。	依如此等義，是故我說一切諸法悉名為心。	Based on these meanings, I say that all dharmas are called mind.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b26_11']	「又復當知，心外相者，如夢所見種種境界，唯心想作，無實外事。	「又復當知，心外相者，如夢所見種種境界，唯心想作，無實外事。	Moreover, one should know that the external characteristics are like various realms seen in a dream, which are only created by the thinking mind and do not have real external things.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907b27_14']	一切境界，悉亦如是，以皆依無明識夢所見，妄想作故。	一切境界，悉亦如是，以皆依無明識夢所見，妄想作故。	All realms are also like this, because they all rely on the deluded mind of ignorance to see and create through delusion.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c01_4']	「復次，應知內心念念不住故，所見、所緣一切境界亦隨心念念不住，所謂心生故種種法生，心滅故種種法滅。	「復次，應知內心念念不住故，所見、所緣一切境界亦隨心念念不住，所謂心生故種種法生，心滅故種種法滅。	Furthermore, one should know that because the internal mind is constantly changing, all realms that are seen and relied upon also follow the mind and are constantly changing. This means that because the mind arises, various dharmas arise, and because the mind ceases, various dharmas cease.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c01_19']	而生滅相，但有名字，實不可得。	而生滅相，但有名字，實不可得。	The characteristics of arising and ceasing are merely names and cannot be truly obtained.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c02_16']	以心不往至於境界，境界亦不來至於心。	以心不往至於境界，境界亦不來至於心。	Because the mind does not go to the objects, and the objects also do not come to the mind.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c03_7']	如鏡中像，無來無去。	如鏡中像，無來無去。	Like an image in a mirror, it has no coming and no going.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c04_3']	是故一切法，求生滅定相，了不可得。	是故一切法，求生滅定相，了不可得。	Therefore, when seeking the definite characteristics of arising and ceasing in all dharmas, they are ultimately unobtainable.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c05_4']	所謂一切法畢竟無體，本來常空，實不生滅故。	所謂一切法畢竟無體，本來常空，實不生滅故。	This is because all dharmas are ultimately without substance, originally always empty, and truly do not arise or cease.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c07_8']	如是一切法實不生滅者，則無一切境界差別之相，寂靜一味，名為真如第一義諦，自性清淨心。	如是一切法實不生滅者，則無一切境界差別之相，寂靜一味，名為真如第一義諦，自性清淨心。	In this way, if all dharmas truly do not arise or cease, then there are no characteristics of distinctions among all objects. The tranquil single flavor is called the ultimate truth of suchness, the mind of intrinsic purity.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c08_6']	彼自性清淨心，湛然圓滿，以無分別相故。	彼自性清淨心，湛然圓滿，以無分別相故。	That mind of intrinsic purity is still and perfectly complete, because it has the characteristic of non-discrimination.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c09_2']	無分別相者，於一切處，無所不在。	無分別相者，於一切處，無所不在。	The characteristic of non-discrimination is that it is not absent from anywhere.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c09_19']	無所不在者，以能依持建立一切法故。	無所不在者，以能依持建立一切法故。	Not being absent from anywhere is because it can rely on, uphold, and establish all dharmas.

['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c13_14']	以諸佛法身，從無始本際來，無障無礙，自在不滅，一切現化種種功業，恒常熾然，未曾休息。	以諸佛法身，從無始本際來，無障無礙，自在不滅，一切現化種種功業，恒常熾然，未曾休息。	Because the Dharma body of all Buddhas, from the beginningless beginning, is unobstructed, unimpeded, sovereign, and unceasing, with all transformations and various meritorious activities always blazing, never resting.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c14_13']	所謂遍一切世界，皆示作業，種種化益故。	所謂遍一切世界，皆示作業，種種化益故。	That is to say, pervading all worlds, manifesting activities, and benefiting through various transformations.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c15_5']	以一佛身，即是一切諸佛身。	以一佛身，即是一切諸佛身。	Because one Buddha body is precisely the body of all Buddhas,
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c15_17']	一切諸佛身，即是一佛身。	一切諸佛身，即是一佛身。	and the body of all Buddhas is precisely one Buddha body.

['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c18_3']	以依一法性而有作業，同自然化，體無別異故。	以依一法性而有作業，同自然化，體無別異故。	Because there is activity based on the single nature of dharmas, naturally transforming together, with no difference in essence.
['ZH_T17_0839_002:0907c19_15']	如是諸佛法身，遍一切處，圓滿不動故，隨諸眾生死此生彼，恒為作依。	如是諸佛法身，遍一切處，圓滿不動故，隨諸眾生死此生彼，恒為作依。	Thus, the Dharma body of all Buddhas pervades everywhere, complete and unmoving. Therefore, it always serves as the support for all sentient beings as they die here and are born there.
