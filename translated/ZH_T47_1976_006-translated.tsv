How much more so now, when they can practice the myriad bodhisattva practices to save sentient beings? How could they not do it?

['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a06_2']	二、止觀行者，如《圓覺》、《楞嚴》、《華嚴》諸方等經，古今學者，廣設觀門，唯台宗三觀，最為直捷，示一心之筌蹄，撮諸法之要領，修行徑路，無踰于此。	二、止觀行者，如《圓覺》、《楞嚴》、《華嚴》諸方等經，古今學者，廣設觀門，唯台宗三觀，最為直捷，示一心之筌蹄，撮諸法之要領，修行徑路，無踰于此。	Second, for practitioners of calming and contemplation, the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment, the Sutra of the Śūraṃgama Samādhi, the Flower Ornament Sutra, and other Mahāyāna sūtras have established various methods of contemplation for ancient and modern learners. Only the three contemplations of the Tiantai school are the most direct and concise. They show the essential method for one mind and grasp the key points of all dharmas. There is no faster path to practice than this.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a08_1']	西方宗旨，自有十六正觀，然一一觀中，具含此三義，故天台詮經，直以三諦攝彼十六。	西方宗旨，自有十六正觀，然一一觀中，具含此三義，故天台詮經，直以三諦攝彼十六。	The Western Pure Land teachings have sixteen correct contemplations, but each contemplation contains these three meanings. Therefore, Tiantai's interpretation of the sutra directly uses the three truths to encompass those sixteen.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a08_8']	《妙宗鈔》曰：	《妙宗鈔》曰：	The Notes on the Wonderful Ultimate says:
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a09_11']	「性中三德體，是諸佛三身，即此三德三身，是我一心三觀。	「性中三德體，是諸佛三身，即此三德三身，是我一心三觀。	The essence of the three virtues is the three bodies of all Buddhas, and these three virtues and three bodies are my one mind's three contemplations.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a10_16']	若不然者，則觀外有佛，境不即心，何名圓宗絕待之觀。	若不然者，則觀外有佛，境不即心，何名圓宗絕待之觀。	If it were not so, then there would be Buddhas outside of contemplation, and the object would not be the mind. How could it be called the absolute contemplation of the perfect teaching?
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a12_16']	亦可彌陀三身以為法身，我之三觀以為般若，觀成見佛即是解脫，舉一具三，如新伊字。	亦可彌陀三身以為法身，我之三觀以為般若，觀成見佛即是解脫，舉一具三，如新伊字。	It can also be said that Amitabha's three bodies are the Dharma body, my three contemplations are prajñā, and seeing the Buddha upon the completion of contemplation is liberation. Each includes the other three, like the character 'xin' (心).
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a13_11']	觀佛既爾，觀諸依正，理非異塗。	觀佛既爾，觀諸依正，理非異塗。	Since contemplating the Buddha is like this, contemplating all the依正 is also the same principle.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a14_1']	」廣如《疏鈔》，不能具述。	」廣如《疏鈔》，不能具述。	It is extensively explained in the commentary, but I cannot include it all here.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a15_1']	至若溫陵禪師，則純以念佛一聲，入三觀門。	至若溫陵禪師，則純以念佛一聲，入三觀門。	As for Chan Master Wenling, he purely uses a single recitation of the Buddha's name to enter the gate of the three contemplations.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a17_7']	言念存三觀者，如一聲佛，遂了此能念體空，所念無相，即念存空觀，所念之佛即應身，即心破見思惑也。	言念存三觀者，如一聲佛，遂了此能念體空，所念無相，即念存空觀，所念之佛即應身，即心破見思惑也。	As for keeping the three contemplations in mind, when one hears the Buddha's name, one realizes that the essence of this remembrance is empty, and what is remembered is signless. This is keeping the contemplation of emptiness in mind. The Buddha who is remembered is the response body, and one's mind breaks through the delusions of views and thoughts.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a19_12']	雖能念體空，所念無相，不妨能念分明，所念顯然，即念存假觀，所念之佛即報身，即心破塵沙惑也。	雖能念體空，所念無相，不妨能念分明，所念顯然，即念存假觀，所念之佛即報身，即心破塵沙惑也。	Although the essence of remembrance is empty and what is remembered is signless, this does not prevent the remembrance from being clear and the remembered object from being evident. This is keeping the contemplation of the provisional in mind. The Buddha who is remembered is the reward body, and one's mind breaks through the delusions of dust and sand.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a20_10']	正當能念所念空時，即能念所念顯然；	正當能念所念空時，即能念所念顯然；	Right when the ability to remember and the remembered object are empty, the ability to remember and the remembered object are evident.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a22_15']	正當能念所念顯時，即是能念所念寂然，空假互存，乃念存中觀，所念之佛即法身，即心破無明惑也。	正當能念所念顯時，即是能念所念寂然，空假互存，乃念存中觀，所念之佛即法身，即心破無明惑也。	Right when the ability to remember and the remembered object are evident, the ability to remember and the remembered object are tranquil. Emptiness and the provisional exist alternately, and this is keeping the contemplation of the middle in mind. The Buddha who is remembered is the Dharma body, and one's mind breaks through the delusions of ignorance.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a25_1']	是又即念佛因，究竟三諦，淨彼四土，如拈一微塵變大地作黃金，是謂法界圓融，不可思議觀門。	是又即念佛因，究竟三諦，淨彼四土，如拈一微塵變大地作黃金，是謂法界圓融，不可思議觀門。	This is also the cause of contemplating the Buddha, the ultimate three truths, purifying the four lands. It is like taking a speck of dust and transforming the entire earth into gold. This is called the inconceivable contemplation of the perfect interfusion of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405a26_13']	三、六度行者，《起信論》曰：	三、六度行者，《起信論》曰：	Third, the practice of the six perfections. The Awakening of Faith says:

Knowing that the essence of dharmas is free from stinginess and greed, one practices in accordance with the perfection of giving;
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b01_6']	法性無染離五欲過故，隨順修行戒波羅蜜；	法性無染離五欲過故，隨順修行戒波羅蜜；	The nature of dharmas is free from defilement and the faults of the five desires, so one practices in accordance with the perfection of morality;
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b02_5', 'ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b03_8']	法性無苦離瞋惱故，隨順修行忍波羅蜜；🔽法性無身心相離懈怠故，隨順修行精進波羅蜜；	法性無苦離瞋惱故，隨順修行忍波羅蜜； 法性無身心相離懈怠故，隨順修行精進波羅蜜；	The nature of dharmas is free from suffering and the vexations of anger, so one practices in accordance with the perfection of patience;🔽The nature of dharmas is free from the characteristics of body and mind and laziness, so one practices in accordance with the perfection of vigor;
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b04_7']	法性常定，體無亂故，隨順修行禪波羅蜜；	法性常定，體無亂故，隨順修行禪波羅蜜；	The nature of dharmas is always in samādhi and free from disturbance, so one practices in accordance with the perfection of meditation;
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b05_8']	法性體明，離無明故，隨順修行般若波羅蜜。	法性體明，離無明故，隨順修行般若波羅蜜。	The essence of dharmatā is clear, because it is free from ignorance. In accordance with this, one practices prajñā-pāramitā.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b05_17']	」故《智度論》曰：	」故《智度論》曰：	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says:
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b06_11']	「菩薩觀一切法畢竟空，不生慳貪心。	「菩薩觀一切法畢竟空，不生慳貪心。	Bodhisattvas contemplate the ultimate emptiness of all dharmas and do not give rise to stingy or greedy thoughts.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b06_15']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b07_12']	畢竟空中無有慳貪，慳貪根本斷故。	畢竟空中無有慳貪，慳貪根本斷故。	Because in ultimate emptiness there is no stinginess or greed, the root of stinginess and greed is severed.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b08_11']	」乃至「般若波羅蜜畢竟空故，常不生癡心。	」乃至「般若波羅蜜畢竟空故，常不生癡心。	It continues, Because prajñā-pāramitā is ultimately empty, one always does not give rise to deluded thoughts.

['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b09_20']	佛說一切法，無施無受，非戒非犯，乃至不智不愚故。	佛說一切法，無施無受，非戒非犯，乃至不智不愚故。	The Buddha says that all dharmas are without giving and without receiving, neither precepts nor offenses, and so forth, up to neither wisdom nor foolishness.
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b10_2']	」又云：	」又云：	It also says:
['ZH_T47_1976_006:0405b11_2']	「菩薩雖不見布施，以清淨空心布施，作是念：	「菩薩雖不見布施，以清淨空心布施，作是念：	Although bodhisattvas do not see giving, they give with a pure and empty mind, thinking like this:
