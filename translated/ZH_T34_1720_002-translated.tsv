The ninety-six arts are wrong, and the dharma of the five vehicles is correct. This means the name correct is inferior.

Only the One Vehicle is the most supreme, so the name wonderful is superior. Therefore, the previous translation is changed to the later translation.

The vehicle of the cause has not yet reached the ultimate, so it is not wondrous. But because the cause studies the practice of the fruit, it is said to be wondrous according to its level.

['ZH_T34_1720_002:0372b08_12']	今所明者，依佛口說，初段明乘之權實、後段明身之權實，乘之權實謂究竟乘，身之權實名究竟身。	今所明者，依佛口說，初段明乘之權實、後段明身之權實，乘之權實謂究竟乘，身之權實名究竟身。	002	What is clarified now is based on the Buddha's own words. The first part clarifies the expedient and true of the vehicle, and the later part clarifies the expedient and true of the body. The expedient and true of the vehicle refers to the ultimate vehicle, and the expedient and true of the body is called the ultimate body.
['ZH_T34_1720_002:0372b10_9']	若言乘權實為究竟、身權實不究竟，是人但信初分經、不信後分經，故信不具足。	若言乘權實為究竟、身權實不究竟，是人但信初分經、不信後分經，故信不具足。	002	If it is said that the expedient and true of the vehicle is ultimate, but the expedient and true of the body is not ultimate, then this person only believes in the earlier part of the sutra and does not believe in the later part of the sutra, so their faith is not complete.

How can it be that only the cause is explained by opening the three and revealing the one?
['ZH_T34_1720_002:0372b20_3']	若今日明一唯是因者，則昔明三乘事亦應然。	若今日明一唯是因者，則昔明三乘事亦應然。	002	If today's explanation of one is only about the cause, then the explanation of the three vehicles in the past should also be so.

It directly leads beings to the fruition of one, so how can it explain the cause?
['ZH_T34_1720_002:0372b22_5']	此義文中已說。	此義文中已說。	002	The meaning of this has already been explained in the text.

This meaning is not so.
['ZH_T34_1720_002:0372b25_17']	又因異聲聞、果同羅漢，所以然者，會三歸一故因異聲聞，猶是無常故果同阿羅漢。	又因異聲聞、果同羅漢，所以然者，會三歸一故因異聲聞，猶是無常故果同阿羅漢。	002	Moreover, the cause is different from that of the śrāvakas, but the fruition is the same as that of the arhat. The reason for this is that since it unifies the three and returns to one, the cause is different from that of the śrāvakas, but it is still impermanent, so the fruition is the same as that of the arhat.
['ZH_T34_1720_002:0372b27_3']	又以今一因感無常之果，亦應以昔二因招常住之報；	又以今一因感無常之果，亦應以昔二因招常住之報；	002	Moreover, using the cause of the present one to attract the impermanent fruition, it should also use the causes of the past two to attract the fruition of permanence;

The bodhisattvas did not see its beginning, and those at the end of study did not know its end. Only the Buddha saw the Buddha's life as immeasurable.
