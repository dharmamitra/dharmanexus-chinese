['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c02_7']	上下二界天人魔梵，及八部鬼神龍等，及他方菩薩皆就寶坊。	上下二界天人魔梵，及八部鬼神龍等，及他方菩薩皆就寶坊。	002	The gods and humans of the upper and lower realms, Māra, Brahmā, the eight kinds of spiritual beings, dragons, and so forth, as well as bodhisattvas from other directions all gather in the jeweled abode.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c04_4']	諸鬼神等有不往者，四天王放熱鐵輪遂之令往至佛所，如來悉勅令守護正法。	諸鬼神等有不往者，四天王放熱鐵輪遂之令往至佛所，如來悉勅令守護正法。	002	Among the spiritual beings, there are some who do not go. The four heavenly kings release burning iron wheels to pursue them and make them go to where the Buddha is. The Tathāgata universally commands them to protect the true Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c05_16']	眾魔王中唯有一箇魔王不順佛勅，待諸眾生成佛盡，我當發菩提心。	眾魔王中唯有一箇魔王不順佛勅，待諸眾生成佛盡，我當發菩提心。	002	Among the many Māras, there is only one Māra who does not follow the Buddha's command, waiting for all sentient beings to become buddhas, and then he will give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment.

['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c07_10']	十種別者：	十種別者：	002	The ten kinds of differences are:
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c11_8']	一說法處別、二境界莊嚴別、三大會來眾別、四所建法輪主伴別、五所來之眾聞法別、六報土淨穢別、七佛身權實別、八出生滅度現相別、九示教行相別、十從初為友軌範別。	一說法處別、二境界莊嚴別、三大會來眾別、四所建法輪主伴別、五所來之眾聞法別、六報土淨穢別、七佛身權實別、八出生滅度現相別、九示教行相別、十從初為友軌範別。	002	First, the difference in the place of expounding the Dharma; second, the difference in the adornment of the realm; third, the difference in the assembly of the great congregation; fourth, the difference in the host and companions of the Dharma wheel that is established; fifth, the difference in the Dharma that is heard by the assembly that has come; sixth, the difference in the purity and impurity of the reward lands; seventh, the difference in the provisional and actual bodies of the Buddhas; eighth, the difference in the appearance of manifesting birth and nirvana; ninth, the difference in the appearance of teaching and practice; tenth, the difference in the initial cultivation of friends and the standard of conduct.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c13_13']	一種同者，如雪山有草名曰肥膩，牛若食者純得醍醐，無有青黃赤白黑色。	一種同者，如雪山有草名曰肥膩，牛若食者純得醍醐，無有青黃赤白黑色。	002	One kind of sameness is like there being grass in the snow mountains called fat and glossy, if cows eat it they will only obtain pure ghee, without any blue, yellow, red, white, or black colors.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c16_18']	一說法處別者，《涅槃經》在拘尸那國阿利羅拔提河邊娑羅雙樹間說，《華嚴經》在摩竭提國菩提場中寶菩提樹下說，故言說法處別。	一說法處別者，《涅槃經》在拘尸那國阿利羅拔提河邊娑羅雙樹間說，《華嚴經》在摩竭提國菩提場中寶菩提樹下說，故言說法處別。	002	First, the difference in the place of expounding the Dharma; the Nirvana Sutra was expounded between the twin sala trees by the Aritravatī River in the country of Kuśinagara, while the Flower Ornament Sutra was expounded under the precious bodhi tree in the site of enlightenment in the country of Magadha. Therefore, it is said that the place of expounding the Dharma is different.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c19_7']	二境界莊嚴別者，如說此《大涅槃經》時，娑羅雙樹吉祥福地，縱廣三十二由旬，大眾充滿其間，無空缺處。	二境界莊嚴別者，如說此《大涅槃經》時，娑羅雙樹吉祥福地，縱廣三十二由旬，大眾充滿其間，無空缺處。	002	Second, the difference in the adornment of the realm is as explained in this Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra. At that time, the auspicious and blessed ground of the Śāla twin trees, thirty-two yojanas long and wide, was filled with the great assembly, without any empty spaces.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c21_17']	爾時四方無邊身菩薩，以其眷屬所坐之處，或如針鋒、或如錐頭，微塵十方如微塵等諸佛世界諸大菩薩悉來集會。	爾時四方無邊身菩薩，以其眷屬所坐之處，或如針鋒、或如錐頭，微塵十方如微塵等諸佛世界諸大菩薩悉來集會。	002	At that time, the bodhisattvas of boundless body from the four directions, in the places where their retinues sat, were either like the tip of a needle or like the point of an awl. Great bodhisattvas from buddha-realms as numerous as dust motes in the ten directions all came to assemble.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c24_15']	又文云「爾時三千大千世界，以佛神力故地皆柔軟，無有丘墟沙土礫石、荊棘毒草，眾寶莊嚴，猶如西方無量壽佛極樂世界。	又文云「爾時三千大千世界，以佛神力故地皆柔軟，無有丘墟沙土礫石、荊棘毒草，眾寶莊嚴，猶如西方無量壽佛極樂世界。	002	The text also says, At that time, by the Buddha's spiritual power, the ground of the trichiliocosm became soft and pliable, without any hills, sand, gravel, thorns, or poisonous plants. Adorned with various jewels, it was like the Land of Ultimate Bliss of Amitāyus Buddha in the west.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c26_13']	是時大眾悉見十方如微塵等諸佛世界，如於明鏡自觀己身，觀諸佛土亦復如是。	是時大眾悉見十方如微塵等諸佛世界，如於明鏡自觀己身，觀諸佛土亦復如是。	002	At that time, the great assembly all saw the buddha-realms as numerous as dust motes in the ten directions, just as one sees one's own body in a clear mirror. Observing the buddha-lands was also like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0727c27_11']	」又下文娑羅雙樹忽然變白，廣如經說。	」又下文娑羅雙樹忽然變白，廣如經說。	002	Also, the text below states that the twin śāla trees suddenly turned white, as explained in detail in the sutra.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a02_1']	如說《華嚴經》時，有十蓮華藏世界海，又上下二十重，最下重中略言十佛世界微塵數廣大國周圍，一一國有十佛剎微塵數諸小國以為眷屬，以上倍增。	如說《華嚴經》時，有十蓮華藏世界海，又上下二十重，最下重中略言十佛世界微塵數廣大國周圍，一一國有十佛剎微塵數諸小國以為眷屬，以上倍增。	002	When explaining the Flower Ornament Sutra, there are ten lotus treasury world oceans, and above and below there are twenty layers. In the lowest layer, it briefly mentions that there are ten buddha-realms' dust mote-like vast countries surrounding each, with ten buddha-realms' dust mote-like small countries as their retinue, and the number above increases twofold.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a04_1']	如是十蓮華藏世界中，金剛為地，樹臺樓閣殿堂池海皆眾寶莊嚴，如經所說「如是我聞：	如是十蓮華藏世界中，金剛為地，樹臺樓閣殿堂池海皆眾寶莊嚴，如經所說「如是我聞：	002	In this way, within the ten lotus treasury worlds, the ground is made of vajra, and the trees, terraces, towers, halls, ponds, and oceans are all adorned with various treasures, as explained in the sutra: Thus have I heard.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a07_1']	一時佛在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺，其地堅固，金剛所成，上妙寶輪及眾寶華清淨摩尼以為嚴飾，諸色相海無邊顯現。	一時佛在摩竭提國阿蘭若法菩提場中始成正覺，其地堅固，金剛所成，上妙寶輪及眾寶華清淨摩尼以為嚴飾，諸色相海無邊顯現。	002	Once, the Buddha was in the place of enlightenment in the Magadha country, in the place of practice, having just attained perfect enlightenment. The ground was solid, made of vajra, with the most wonderful jeweled wheels and various jeweled flowers, pure maṇi jewels used for adornment, and the ocean of various appearances manifesting endlessly.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a08_9']	如是以下直至一切佛土不思議劫所有莊嚴，悉皆含容顯現。	如是以下直至一切佛土不思議劫所有莊嚴，悉皆含容顯現。	002	In this way, all the adornments of all buddha lands up to inconceivable kalpas are all contained and manifested.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a09_7']	」中間兩紙已來經，是歎佛境界所有莊嚴。	」中間兩紙已來經，是歎佛境界所有莊嚴。	002	The two pages of sutra above praise the adornments of the Buddha's realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a12_1']	又下文〈華藏世界品〉廣說如此莊嚴，則是如來自身實報之所莊嚴，非如此《涅槃經》中以佛神力為眾生故暫化令淨。	又下文〈華藏世界品〉廣說如此莊嚴，則是如來自身實報之所莊嚴，非如此《涅槃經》中以佛神力為眾生故暫化令淨。	002	Moreover, the chapter on the Flower Treasury World extensively explains these adornments, which are the adornments of the Tathāgata's own true reward, not like the adornments temporarily manifested by the Buddha's spiritual power for the sake of sentient beings in the Nirvana Sutra.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a12_6']	所以然者？	所以然者？	002	Why is this so?
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a13_14']	為此《涅槃經》來眾三乘根眾雜故，若不以佛神力持，無功自見。	為此《涅槃經》來眾三乘根眾雜故，若不以佛神力持，無功自見。	002	Because in the Nirvana Sutra, the assembly of the three vehicles is mixed, and if it is not upheld by the Buddha's spiritual power, they will see it naturally without effort.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a14_8']	如《華嚴經》中，一乘根純無有雜眾。	如《華嚴經》中，一乘根純無有雜眾。	002	In the Flower Ornament Sutra, the assembly has the capacity for the One Vehicle and is pure without any mixture.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a15_6']	如聲聞為根別故，在其會內元來不見。	如聲聞為根別故，在其會內元來不見。	002	Just as the assembly of śrāvakas is separate, they originally do not see it within their own assembly.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a16_7']	經中雖然還有以佛神力，下文還有法如是故。	經中雖然還有以佛神力，下文還有法如是故。	002	Although it is like this in the sutra, there is still the Buddha's spiritual power, and there is still the principle of the Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a17_16']	又言佛神者，應真曰神，非同實，是凡夫，加令暫見，名之曰神。	又言佛神者，應真曰神，非同實，是凡夫，加令暫見，名之曰神。	002	As for the Buddha's spiritual powers, the sages are called spiritual, not the same as ordinary beings. Temporarily manifesting to let them see is called spiritual powers.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a18_15']	當知華藏莊嚴本明實報，涅槃神力暫爾權施。	當知華藏莊嚴本明實報，涅槃神力暫爾權施。	002	One should know that the adornments of the Flower Treasury originally clarify the true reward, and the spiritual powers of nirvana are temporarily provisionally established.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a20_19']	又《涅槃經》推佛淨土在於西方過三十二恒河沙佛土之外，不在此處，故即明知是化，非為實故。	又《涅槃經》推佛淨土在於西方過三十二恒河沙佛土之外，不在此處，故即明知是化，非為實故。	002	Moreover, the Nirvana Sutra pushes the Buddha's Pure Land to be in the west, beyond the buddha lands of thirty-two Ganges Rivers, not in this place. Therefore, it is immediately known to be a manifestation, not for the sake of reality.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a23_18']	三大會來眾別者，說此《大涅槃經》，所有來眾總是人天種性，三乘之眾皆是憶念如來，涕淚盈目、荷奉香薪，嗟苦悲哀、戀承佛日。	三大會來眾別者，說此《大涅槃經》，所有來眾總是人天種性，三乘之眾皆是憶念如來，涕淚盈目、荷奉香薪，嗟苦悲哀、戀承佛日。	002	As for the differences in the assemblies of the three great gatherings, the assemblies that come to expound this Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra are all of the species of humans and gods, and the assemblies of the three vehicles all remember the Tathāgata, with tears filling their eyes, bearing fragrant firewood, lamenting in bitter grief, and longing to receive the Buddha's sun.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a24_11']	如是等眾，宜堪聞佛滅度之眾。	如是等眾，宜堪聞佛滅度之眾。	002	Such assemblies are suitable for hearing the assembly of the Buddha's parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a25_9']	除諸一乘菩薩入佛智等眾，餘皆例然。	除諸一乘菩薩入佛智等眾，餘皆例然。	002	Excluding the assemblies of the bodhisattvas of the One Vehicle who enter the Buddha's wisdom and so forth, the rest are all the same.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a27_2']	《華嚴經》所來之眾，皆性智海中佛果位內諸菩薩眾，純是一乘，更無別種。	《華嚴經》所來之眾，皆性智海中佛果位內諸菩薩眾，純是一乘，更無別種。	002	The assembly that comes to the Flower Ornament Sutra is all the bodhisattva assembly within the ocean of the nature-wisdom and the stage of buddhahood, purely of the One Vehicle, without any other kind.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a28_1']	人天神眾皆悉同根，入佛智流、具佛知見。	人天神眾皆悉同根，入佛智流、具佛知見。	002	The assembly of humans, gods, and spirits all have the same root, enter the flow of the Buddha's wisdom, and possess the Buddha's insight.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728a29_7']	初會之中十佛世界微塵等諸菩薩眾，皆從如來善根海生。	初會之中十佛世界微塵等諸菩薩眾，皆從如來善根海生。	002	In the first assembly, there is an assembly of bodhisattvas equal to the dust motes in ten buddha-realms, all born from the ocean of the Tathāgata's wholesome roots.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b02_5']	善根海者，則是如來法身智海，大智所生，一切諸佛以法身根本智以為根本所生；	善根海者，則是如來法身智海，大智所生，一切諸佛以法身根本智以為根本所生；	002	The ocean of wholesome roots is the Tathāgata's ocean of Dharma body wisdom. Born from great wisdom, all buddhas take the fundamental wisdom of the fundamental Dharma body as their origin.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b02_19']	若不如是，所有行門總屬有為。	若不如是，所有行門總屬有為。	002	If it were not so, all the practices would belong to the conditioned.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b05_3']	如此之眾，從初發心入佛智海，寄治十信、十住、十行、十迴向、十地、等覺六位，淺深行相差別不同。	如此之眾，從初發心入佛智海，寄治十信、十住、十行、十迴向、十地、等覺六位，淺深行相差別不同。	002	Such an assembly, from the initial arousal of the mind to enter the ocean of the Buddha's wisdom, provisionally cultivates the ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and equal enlightenment, with the differences in the characteristics of the shallow and deep practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b05_21']	《涅槃》三乘同攝，人天善種同來至會。	《涅槃》三乘同攝，人天善種同來至會。	002	The Nirvana Sutra includes the three vehicles, and the seeds of goodness of humans and gods all come to the assembly together.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b07_2']	《華嚴經》三乘之眾不霑其會，設在會內如聾不聞。	《華嚴經》三乘之眾不霑其會，設在會內如聾不聞。	002	In the Huayan Sutra, the assembly of the three vehicles did not receive its teachings, and even if they were present in the assembly, they were like the deaf not hearing.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b10_1']	當知《涅槃》會三乘，菩薩聲聞人天眾，不同《華嚴》，此是一乘位中菩薩眾也，初發心位階同佛位，入佛智流同佛知見，為真佛子也。	當知《涅槃》會三乘，菩薩聲聞人天眾，不同《華嚴》，此是一乘位中菩薩眾也，初發心位階同佛位，入佛智流同佛知見，為真佛子也。	002	One should know that in the Nirvana Assembly, the assembly of the three vehicles, bodhisattvas, sravakas, humans, and devas, is not the same as the Huayan. This is the assembly of bodhisattvas in the stage of the One Vehicle, who from the initial stage of generating the mind enter the stage of the Buddha, enter the Buddha's wisdom stream, and have the same knowledge and insight as the Buddha, becoming true Buddha's disciples.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b13_11']	四所建法輪主伴別者，《涅槃經》勸請之首，即是迦葉菩薩、文殊師利菩薩、師子吼菩薩、舍利弗等，為法軌度勸請之首。	四所建法輪主伴別者，《涅槃經》勸請之首，即是迦葉菩薩、文殊師利菩薩、師子吼菩薩、舍利弗等，為法軌度勸請之首。	002	Fourth, the difference in the host and companions of the Dharma wheel established, in the Nirvana Sutra, the first to make requests is the bodhisattvas Kasyapa, Manjushri, Shizihou, and Shariputra, who are the leaders in requesting according to the Dharma rules.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b14_4']	魔王波旬勸請如來入涅槃。	魔王波旬勸請如來入涅槃。	002	The Mara King Papimcana requests the Tathagata to enter Nirvana.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b18_7']	如《華嚴經》建法之首，即是普賢、文殊、覺首、法慧、功德林、金剛幢、金剛藏等，如是十首、十慧、十林、十幢、十藏佛果位內大菩薩等，建立五位佛果之行相法門故，以諸位明位位中有佛果故。	如《華嚴經》建法之首，即是普賢、文殊、覺首、法慧、功德林、金剛幢、金剛藏等，如是十首、十慧、十林、十幢、十藏佛果位內大菩薩等，建立五位佛果之行相法門故，以諸位明位位中有佛果故。	002	As the Huayan Sutra establishes the Dharma at the beginning, it is the great bodhisattvas such as Samantabhadra, Mañjuśrī, Jiguang, Fahui, Gongde Forest, Vajra Banner, Vajra Treasury, and so forth. These ten leaders, ten wisdoms, ten forests, ten banners, and ten treasuries are the Dharma gates of the characteristics of the practices of the Buddha's fruition within the five positions. Therefore, the various positions clarify that within each position there is the Buddha's fruition.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b23_11']	故如《華嚴經》所有建立法度問答諸菩薩，皆是十方此土諸菩薩眾，盡是神洞真源、智齊法界，十方應現，不來而到、不去而至，稱法性之施設、非往來之所致，纖塵之內乃有無盡身雲、微毫之中顯現難思相海，十方法界一切皆然。	故如《華嚴經》所有建立法度問答諸菩薩，皆是十方此土諸菩薩眾，盡是神洞真源、智齊法界，十方應現，不來而到、不去而至，稱法性之施設、非往來之所致，纖塵之內乃有無盡身雲、微毫之中顯現難思相海，十方法界一切皆然。	002	Therefore, in the Huayan Sutra, all the Dharma gates established, questions and answers, and bodhisattvas are the assemblies of bodhisattvas from the ten directions and this land. They all have spiritual penetration of the true source and wisdom equal to the Dharma realm. They respond and appear in the ten directions, not coming yet arriving, not going yet reaching. It is the establishment of the Dharma nature, not due to coming and going. Within a single particle of dust, there are inexhaustible clouds of bodies, and in a single instant, inconceivable oceans of characteristics are manifested. It is the same in all the Dharma realms of the ten directions.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b24_4']	一切處忽然而有，無所從來；	一切處忽然而有，無所從來；	002	Suddenly appearing everywhere, coming from nowhere;
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b24_14']	忽爾而無，亦無所去。	忽爾而無，亦無所去。	002	Suddenly gone, also going nowhere.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b27_3']	於一切處一切時，於有情身相境界山河大海十方虛空示現色像，有無自在、無盡重重，皆是如是大菩薩眾。	於一切處一切時，於有情身相境界山河大海十方虛空示現色像，有無自在、無盡重重，皆是如是大菩薩眾。	002	Everywhere and at all times, in the bodies of sentient beings, in the appearances, mountains, rivers, great oceans, and ten directions of space, manifesting forms and images, with mastery over existence and non-existence, inexhaustible and multilayered, all are such great bodhisattva assemblies.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728b29_17']	是故不同《涅槃經》中迦葉菩薩、聲聞舍利弗，生在人家、示同凡位，引彼三乘之種，見佛涅槃而生悲感，涕流盈目而來集會。	是故不同《涅槃經》中迦葉菩薩、聲聞舍利弗，生在人家、示同凡位，引彼三乘之種，見佛涅槃而生悲感，涕流盈目而來集會。	002	Therefore, it is different from the case of Kāśyapa Bodhisattva and the śrāvaka Śāriputra in the Nirvana Sutra, who were born in ordinary families, demonstrating the same as ordinary beings, leading those of the three vehicles to see the Buddha's nirvana and give rise to grief, with tears filling their eyes as they gathered.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728c04_6']	五所來之眾聞法別者，此《涅槃經》為諸聲聞二乘權教菩薩行諸觀行未離執障，樂著諸行執持行相，於此行相迷無作法身無證無修本來自體也。	五所來之眾聞法別者，此《涅槃經》為諸聲聞二乘權教菩薩行諸觀行未離執障，樂著諸行執持行相，於此行相迷無作法身無證無修本來自體也。	002	As for the assembly that comes to hear the Dharma separately, this Nirvana Sutra is for the śrāvakas, those of the two vehicles' provisional teachings, and bodhisattvas who practice various contemplations but have not yet left the obstacles of attachment, who delight in and cling to various practices and grasp at the characteristics of practices, and who are confused about the unconditioned dharma body, which has no realization and no cultivation, and is originally self-existent.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728c05_5']	以行修生，修顯建立，菩提涅槃能所等證。	以行修生，修顯建立，菩提涅槃能所等證。	002	Through cultivation and practice, cultivation and manifestation establish the realization of bodhi, nirvana, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1739_002:0728c06_17']	如來為此根故，於此《涅槃經》說諸行無常是生滅法，生滅滅已寂滅為樂。	如來為此根故，於此《涅槃經》說諸行無常是生滅法，生滅滅已寂滅為樂。	002	For this reason, the Tathāgata, in this Nirvana Sutra, speaks of all conditioned things as impermanent, subject to arising and ceasing. With the cessation of arising and ceasing, there is the bliss of quiescent extinction.
