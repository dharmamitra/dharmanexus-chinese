The first, the Śrāvaka Teaching, refers to this lion, which is a dependently arisen phenomenon that arises and ceases moment by moment, illustrating that all phenomena exist due to conditions.

The gate of simultaneous perfection and correspondence, 2. The gate of the mutual inclusion of one and many, 3. The gate of the simultaneous accomplishment of the secret and the revealed, 4. The gate of the realm of Indra's net, 5. The gate of the virtues of purity and mixture in the various treasuries, 6. The gate of the freedom of the mutual identity of all phenomena, 7.

Within this, principle and phenomena are each different. Sometimes many each abide in their own position, such as the practices in accordance with principle, each of which contains all dharmas.
