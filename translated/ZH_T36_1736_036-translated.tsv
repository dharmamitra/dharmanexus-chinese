['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a07_3']	此意稍隱，先應問言：	此意稍隱，先應問言：	036	This meaning is slightly hidden. First, a question should be asked:
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a08_15']	上辨二定但云亦合將根事對於境理，今何雙言將境事理對根理事？	上辨二定但云亦合將根事對於境理，今何雙言將境事理對根理事？	036	Above, in distinguishing the two concentrations, it was said that the matter of the faculties should be matched with the principle of the objects. Why is it now said that the matter and principle of the objects should be matched with the matter and principle of the faculties?
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a09_2']	故應答言：	故應答言：	036	Therefore, the answer should be given:
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a10_2']	以上二定不能自別，要因起觀方知事理。	以上二定不能自別，要因起觀方知事理。	036	Because the above two concentrations cannot distinguish themselves, they must rely on giving rise to contemplation in order to know the matter and principle.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a11_13']	如眼入定未知何定，以見塵上了色差別是其事觀，欲令無礙故。	如眼入定未知何定，以見塵上了色差別是其事觀，欲令無礙故。	036	For example, in the concentration on the eye faculty, it is not known which concentration it is. Seeing the distinctions in the visible objects is the matter contemplation, in order to make it unobstructed.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a13_6']	說根中入定是其理定，境入根起既了根性空，故說境中入於事定。	說根中入定是其理定，境入根起既了根性空，故說境中入於事定。	036	It is said that entering concentration in the faculty is the principle concentration. When the entry of the object into the faculty has already understood the emptiness of the nature of the faculty, therefore it is said that entering concentration in the object is the matter concentration.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a14_16']	則經文中已辨根理對於境事，故但合例以將根事定對於境理。	則經文中已辨根理對於境事，故但合例以將根事定對於境理。	036	Then, in the sutra text, the principle of the faculty has already been distinguished in relation to the matter of the object, so it is only necessary to combine the matter concentration of the faculty with the principle of the object.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a17_15']	今此二觀不因定別，根上境上各有二觀，謂根入定即於境上從理觀起而分別事，於色入定即於根上從事觀起分別於理。	今此二觀不因定別，根上境上各有二觀，謂根入定即於境上從理觀起而分別事，於色入定即於根上從事觀起分別於理。	036	Now, these two contemplations are not distinguished by concentration. Each has two contemplations on the faculty and on the object. That is to say, entering concentration in the faculty gives rise to the principle contemplation on the object in order to distinguish the matter. Entering concentration in the visible object gives rise to the matter contemplation on the faculty in order to distinguish the principle.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a19_15']	經文已有此二，未於境上從事觀起分別於理，及與根上從理觀起分別於事。	經文已有此二，未於境上從事觀起分別於理，及與根上從理觀起分別於事。	036	The sutra text already has these two, but it has not yet distinguished from the realm, starting from the contemplation of events and giving rise to discrimination of principles, and from the faculties, starting from the contemplation of principles and giving rise to discrimination of events.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a20_5']	若作偈者，應云：	若作偈者，應云：	036	If one were to make a verse, it should say:

['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a23_15']	及於色塵中入正定，於眼根中理觀起，分別一切上妙眼，諸天世人莫能知。	及於色塵中入正定，於眼根中理觀起，分別一切上妙眼，諸天世人莫能知。	036	And entering right concentration in the object of form, giving rise to the contemplation of principles in the eye faculty, distinguishing all sublime eyes, which the gods and humans cannot know.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a25_17']	斯則境上事起觀理，以對根上理起觀事，故云「亦應以境事理對根理事以辨無礙」也。	斯則境上事起觀理，以對根上理起觀事，故云「亦應以境事理對根理事以辨無礙」也。	036	This is the contemplation of principles arising from events in the realm, corresponding to the contemplation of events arising from principles in the faculties. Therefore it is said that one should also use the events and principles of the realm to distinguish the principle and events of the faculties in order to discern the unobstructed.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0274a27_9']	疏「第四對出入無礙」者，即於經入正定對從定起言，及起定不亂作義。	疏「第四對出入無礙」者，即於經入正定對從定起言，及起定不亂作義。	036	The commentary says the fourth pair is the unobstructedness of entering and exiting, which refers to the words entering right concentration and arising from concentration in the sutra, as well as the meaning of not being confused when arising from concentration.

The five are: the root, matter, entering the realm, principle, and arising. The six are: the realm, matter, entering the root, principle, and arising. The seven are: the root, principle, entering the realm, matter, and arising. The eight are: the realm, principle, entering the root, matter, and arising. The nine are: the root, matter, principle, entering the realm, matter, principle, and arising. The ten are: the realm, matter, principle, entering the root, matter, principle, and arising.

They all first cite the sūtra and indicate the contemplation, and later use the meaning of the sūtra to explain the middle contemplation.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0277c24_7']	疏釋成中有二義釋次二句中道觀：	疏釋成中有二義釋次二句中道觀：	036	The commentary explains the two meanings of the two sentences on the contemplation of the middle way:
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0277c26_1']	一云「由觀前生滅一切諸法即無性故」者，一切法故非無，即無性故非有。	一云「由觀前生滅一切諸法即無性故」者，一切法故非無，即無性故非有。	036	One says, Because of contemplating the arising and ceasing of all dharmas as being without essence, all dharmas are not nonexistent, and because they are without essence, they are not existent.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0277c27_15']	由前但觀無性是空、但觀假名是假，今二相即，故非空非假，是中道義。	由前但觀無性是空、但觀假名是假，今二相即，故非空非假，是中道義。	036	Because previously one only contemplated the emptiness of the lack of essence and only contemplated the conventionality of provisional names, now the two aspects are identical, so it is neither empty nor provisional, which is the meaning of the middle way.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0277c28_7']	此約即緣生法以明中道。	此約即緣生法以明中道。	036	This is based on the arising of dependent origination to clarify the middle way.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0277c29_10']	二云「相體即是不生滅也」者，約三性義以辨中道。	二云「相體即是不生滅也」者，約三性義以辨中道。	036	Two, The characteristics and essence are precisely non-arising and non-ceasing, which is based on the meaning of the three natures to discern the middle way.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a01_2']	然無生多義，略有二種：	然無生多義，略有二種：	036	However, non-arising has many meanings, but in brief there are two kinds:
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a01_16']	一事無生，緣生之相即無生故；	一事無生，緣生之相即無生故；	036	First, the non-arising of phenomena, because the characteristics of arising from conditions are themselves non-arising;
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a02_10']	二理無生，圓成實體本不生故。	二理無生，圓成實體本不生故。	036	Second, the non-arising of principle, because the essence of perfect completion is originally unborn.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a03_12']	今既經言該一切法，不揀相性，則相體皆無生矣。	今既經言該一切法，不揀相性，則相體皆無生矣。	036	Since the sutra now encompasses all dharmas without distinguishing characteristics and essence, then both characteristics and essence are non-arising.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a05_16']	則遍計無生是空觀，緣生假有是假觀，緣生無生及圓成無生皆中道觀，則性相二宗三觀皆具。	則遍計無生是空觀，緣生假有是假觀，緣生無生及圓成無生皆中道觀，則性相二宗三觀皆具。	036	Then, the non-arising of the imagined is the contemplation of emptiness, the provisional existence of dependent arising is the contemplation of the provisional, and the non-arising of dependent arising and the non-arising of the perfected are both the contemplation of the middle way. Thus, both the nature and characteristics schools possess the three contemplations.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a07_9']	然此二偈亦可但為性空之觀，則初二句正辨性空，故言自性無所有；	然此二偈亦可但為性空之觀，則初二句正辨性空，故言自性無所有；	036	However, these two verses can also be taken as simply being the contemplation of nature emptiness. The first two lines directly discern nature emptiness, thus saying the nature does not exist.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a08_3']	次假觀二句通妨，謂有難言：	次假觀二句通妨，謂有難言：	036	Next, the two lines of the contemplation of the provisional clarify a difficulty. The difficulty says:
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a08_13']	現見生滅，那言無生？	現見生滅，那言無生？	036	Clearly seeing arising and ceasing, how can it be said there is no arising?
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a08_17']	故釋云：	故釋云：	036	Therefore, the explanation says:
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a09_3']	隨世假說耳。	隨世假說耳。	036	It is only provisionally spoken in accordance with the world.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a11_11']	次二句中觀正示不生之理，依此釋者極順常解三論中意，而未得於龍樹玄旨，故疏取論三觀釋之。	次二句中觀正示不生之理，依此釋者極順常解三論中意，而未得於龍樹玄旨，故疏取論三觀釋之。	036	The next two lines of the contemplation of the middle way correctly demonstrate the principle of non-arising. If interpreted in this way, it is extremely in accord with the usual understanding of the three treatises, but it does not yet attain the profound meaning of Nāgārjuna. Therefore, the commentary takes the three contemplations of the treatise to explain it.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a13_2']	疏「法性本空非觀之使空故無所取」者，此以性空門顯無所取。	疏「法性本空非觀之使空故無所取」者，此以性空門顯無所取。	036	The commentary says, The nature of dharmas is originally empty, not made empty by contemplation, thus there is nothing to grasp. This uses the gate of nature emptiness to reveal the absence of grasping.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a14_3']	次云「何有能見者」，即以相待門遣其能見。	次云「何有能見者」，即以相待門遣其能見。	036	Next, it says How can there be one who sees? This uses the gate of mutual dependence to eliminate the one who sees.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a14_11']	此中語略，合云：	此中語略，合云：	036	The words here are concise, and should be combined as follows:
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a16_1']	若有所取則有能取，既無所取故無能取，能因於所而得立故。	若有所取則有能取，既無所取故無能取，能因於所而得立故。	036	If there is something to be grasped, then there is a grasper. Since there is nothing to be grasped, therefore there is no grasper. The grasper is established based on the grasped.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a16_7']	亦曰相因門。	亦曰相因門。	036	It is also called the gate of mutual dependence.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a18_11']	然取與見皆通能所，今所取之中則存於所取略無能取，於能見中略無所見，所見即所取故。	然取與見皆通能所，今所取之中則存於所取略無能取，於能見中略無所見，所見即所取故。	036	However, grasping and seeing both include the grasper and the grasped. In the case of the grasped, it retains the grasped but lacks the grasper, and in the case of the seer, it lacks the seen. This is because the seen is the grasped.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a20_5']	疏「又上來以空遣有」等者，此別為二釋，不分止觀，四偈相躡總為遣病。	疏「又上來以空遣有」等者，此別為二釋，不分止觀，四偈相躡總為遣病。	036	The commentary says Furthermore, the previous used emptiness to eliminate existence, etc. This is a separate explanation in two parts, not distinguishing between calming and contemplation. The four verses follow each other in sequence, generally eliminating illnesses.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a22_11']	則四偈中，初二句以空遣有，次二句以假遣空，次二句以如不生滅雙遣空假，次二句且結觀益。	則四偈中，初二句以空遣有，次二句以假遣空，次二句以如不生滅雙遣空假，次二句且結觀益。	036	In the four verses, the first two lines use emptiness to eliminate existence, the next two lines use the provisional to eliminate emptiness, the next two lines use suchness, non-arising, and non-ceasing to eliminate both emptiness and the provisional, and the next two lines conclude the benefits of contemplation.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a23_1']	第三偈即雙遣非。	第三偈即雙遣非。	036	The third verse then eliminates both.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a23_17']	疏從「若謂雙非」下，正釋第三偈。	疏從「若謂雙非」下，正釋第三偈。	036	The commentary from If it is said to be neither of the two below correctly explains the third verse.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a24_14']	以上來疏重舉前文生此偈故，故此正釋。	以上來疏重舉前文生此偈故，故此正釋。	036	Above, the commentary repeatedly cites the previous text to give rise to this verse, therefore this is the correct explanation.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a25_18']	於中，初舉所破、次「故辨起心皆妄」下以偈正破。	於中，初舉所破、次「故辨起心皆妄」下以偈正破。	036	In it, first it raises what is to be refuted, then below Therefore, discerning the mind is all false it correctly refutes with the verse.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a26_14']	「起心皆妄，絕念方真」，釋其上半。	「起心皆妄，絕念方真」，釋其上半。	036	Discerning the mind is all false, only when thoughts cease is it true explains the first half.
['ZH_T36_1736_036:0278a27_19']	「念本自無，斯絕亦滅」，釋其下半，以性空無念亦不可思故。	「念本自無，斯絕亦滅」，釋其下半，以性空無念亦不可思故。	036	Thoughts are originally non-existent, this cessation also ceases explains the second half, because the nature of emptiness without thought is also inconceivable.
