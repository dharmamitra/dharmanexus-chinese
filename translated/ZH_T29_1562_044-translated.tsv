['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590b28_17']	生善趣者，謂生人天，由此趣中多行善故、妙可稱故立善趣名。	生善趣者，謂生人天，由此趣中多行善故、妙可稱故立善趣名。	Being born in good destinies means being born in the human and heavenly realms, because in these realms one mostly practices good and it is excellent, thus they are called good destinies.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c01_2']	於善趣內常生貴家，謂婆羅門，或剎帝利、巨富長者。	於善趣內常生貴家，謂婆羅門，或剎帝利、巨富長者。	In good destinies, they are always born in noble families, namely the brāhmaṇa caste, or the kṣatriya caste, or the very wealthy brāhmaṇa caste.

Why is it that only at the stage of cultivating the karma for the excellent characteristics, is the bodhisattva said to receive the name of the stage of abiding?

['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c15_8']	唯是男子非女等身，爾時已超女等位故。	唯是男子非女等身，爾時已超女等位故。	They are only males, not females or others, because at that time they have already transcended the state of females and others.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c16_7']	此不應說，於前頌中恒受男身義已顯故。	此不應說，於前頌中恒受男身義已顯故。	This should not be said, because the meaning of always receiving a male body has already been shown in the previous verse.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c18_6']	若謂先說造此業已恒受男身，今說為明初造此業亦非女等，故此與前義有差別。	若謂先說造此業已恒受男身，今說為明初造此業亦非女等，故此與前義有差別。	If it is said that the previous statement creates this karma and always receives a male body, and now it is said to clarify that in creating this karma for the first time, one is also not a female or others, therefore there is a difference in meaning between this and the previous statement.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c18_16']	此救非理，義已成故。	此救非理，義已成故。	This refutation is unreasonable, because the meaning has already been established.

['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c24_8']	造此業時唯現對佛，謂親見佛不共色身相好端嚴種種奇特，有欲引起感此類思，不對如來無容起故。	造此業時唯現對佛，謂親見佛不共色身相好端嚴種種奇特，有欲引起感此類思，不對如來無容起故。	When one creates this karma, one must be in the presence of a buddha, that is, one must personally see the special and marvelous major and minor marks of the unshared form body of a buddha, and one must have a desire to summon the volition that summons this kind of karma. Without being in the presence of a tathāgata, one is not fit to create this karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c25_7']	此妙相業唯緣佛思，佛是可欣順德境故。	此妙相業唯緣佛思，佛是可欣順德境故。	This karma that summons the marvelous marks has only the Buddha as its object of volition, because the Buddha is the object of admiration and good qualities.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c26_7']	感妙相業唯思所成，非修所成，不定界故。	感妙相業唯思所成，非修所成，不定界故。	Karma that summons the marvelous marks is only volitionally created, not created through cultivation, because it is not of the realm of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c27_6']	所感異熟此所繫故，非聞所成，彼羸劣故。	所感異熟此所繫故，非聞所成，彼羸劣故。	It is not created through hearing, because it is weak.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0590c27_16']	亦非生得，加行起故。	亦非生得，加行起故。	It is also not innate, because it is created through added effort.

['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591a01_11']	唯餘百劫造修非多，諸佛因中法應如是。	唯餘百劫造修非多，諸佛因中法應如是。	Only the remaining one hundred eons are spent in creating and cultivating them, not many more, because this is the way it is for Buddhas-to-be.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591a03_1']	唯薄伽梵釋迦牟尼，精進滿時能超九劫，九十一劫妙相業成。	唯薄伽梵釋迦牟尼，精進滿時能超九劫，九十一劫妙相業成。	Only the Blessed One Śākyamuni, when his effort was complete, was able to transcend nine eons, and the actions producing the excellent characteristics were completed in ninety-one eons.

['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591b23_18']	菩薩發願初修施時，未能遍於一切含識施一切物唯運悲心，彼於後時串習力故悲心轉盛，能遍施與一切有情非一切物。	菩薩發願初修施時，未能遍於一切含識施一切物唯運悲心，彼於後時串習力故悲心轉盛，能遍施與一切有情非一切物。	When a bodhisattva first generates the vow and practices giving, he is not yet able to give all things to all sentient beings. He only generates a mind of compassion. Later, through the power of repeated practice, his mind of compassion increases and he is able to give to all sentient beings, although not all things.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591b26_2']	若時菩薩普於一切能捨一切但由悲心，非自希求勝生差別，齊此布施波羅蜜多修習圓滿。	若時菩薩普於一切能捨一切但由悲心，非自希求勝生差別，齊此布施波羅蜜多修習圓滿。	When a bodhisattva universally gives all things to all sentient beings, only because of a mind of compassion, not because he himself seeks a superior rebirth, at that time the perfection of giving is completed.

['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591b28_16']	菩薩觀諸世間，匱乏資財貧苦所逼，為欲饒益，亦帶悲心發願自求勝生差別，以諸菩薩曾無一時不運悲心而行施故。	菩薩觀諸世間，匱乏資財貧苦所逼，為欲饒益，亦帶悲心發願自求勝生差別，以諸菩薩曾無一時不運悲心而行施故。	A bodhisattva observes that the world is lacking in wealth and is oppressed by poverty and suffering. In order to benefit them, he also generates a mind of compassion and vows to seek a superior rebirth for himself. This is because bodhisattvas never at any time fail to generate a mind of compassion when practicing giving.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591c01_12']	若時菩薩被析身支，雖未離欲貪而心無少忿，齊此戒忍波羅蜜多修習圓滿。	若時菩薩被析身支，雖未離欲貪而心無少忿，齊此戒忍波羅蜜多修習圓滿。	When a bodhisattva is having his body cut up and although he has not yet eliminated the craving of desire, his mind has not the slightest anger, at that time the perfections of morality and patience are completed.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591c02_7']	忍圓滿者，於彼有情心無忿故。	忍圓滿者，於彼有情心無忿故。	One who is replete with patience has no anger in his mind toward those sentient beings.

Maitreya was first ripe himself, not those to be transformed.

He suddenly had a pure mind, held himself up, and stood on one foot for seven days and nights, praising that Buddha with wonderful verses, saying:

At this point, the perfections of concentration and wisdom were fully cultivated.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0591c21_12']	理應此位無間方圓得盡智時此方滿故，別別能到圓德彼岸故。	理應此位無間方圓得盡智時此方滿故，別別能到圓德彼岸故。	Reason dictates that at this stage, immediately upon attaining the knowledge of completion, this [perfection of wisdom] is fulfilled, because it separately and individually reaches the other shore of perfect virtue.

Herein, there is that which is meritorious, action, and event; there is that which is meritorious and action but not an event; there is that which is meritorious and an event but not action; and there is that which is only meritorious, neither action nor an event.

Because they are good, they are meritorious. Because they are created, they are also action. Because they are the gateway for the arising and transformation of the volition that gives rise to bodily and verbal actions, they are also called events.

Since the class of morality is only by nature bodily and vocal action, it is called meritorious action and meritorious activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_044:0592a06_11']	修類中慈唯名福事，業之事故。	修類中慈唯名福事，業之事故。	Among the class of cultivation, loving-kindness is only called meritorious activity, because it is the activity of merit.

The morality of volition concomitant with loving-kindness is called meritorious action.
