['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b03_11']	那落迦等下四趣全，及天一分眷屬中有，并器世間，總名欲界。	那落迦等下四趣全，及天一分眷屬中有，并器世間，總名欲界。	The hells and so forth, the lower four destinies in their entirety, and a part of the heavens, the retinue of the intermediate state of existence, and the receptacle world, are collectively called the desire realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b04_1']	天一分者，謂六欲天：	天一分者，謂六欲天：	A part of the heavens refers to the six desire heavens:
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b05_17']	一四大王眾天、二三十三天、三夜摩天、四覩史多天、五樂變化天、六他化自在天。	一四大王眾天、二三十三天、三夜摩天、四覩史多天、五樂變化天、六他化自在天。	First, the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings, second, the Heaven of the Thirty-three, third, the Yāma Heaven, fourth, the Tuṣita Heaven, fifth, the Heaven of Delight in Transformations, sixth, the Heaven of Freely Partaking of the Pleasures of Others' Transformations.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b06_15']	如是欲界地獄趣等并器世間，總有十處。	如是欲界地獄趣等并器世間，總有十處。	Thus, the desire realm, the hells, and so forth, along with the receptacle world, altogether have ten locations.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b07_6']	地獄、洲異，分為二十。	地獄、洲異，分為二十。	The hells and the different continents are divided into twenty.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b10_2']	八大地獄名地獄異，一等活地獄、二黑繩地獄、三眾合地獄、四號叫地獄、五大叫地獄、六炎熱地獄、七大熱地獄、八無間地獄。	八大地獄名地獄異，一等活地獄、二黑繩地獄、三眾合地獄、四號叫地獄、五大叫地獄、六炎熱地獄、七大熱地獄、八無間地獄。	The eight great hells are called the different hells: first, the Saṃjīva Hell, second, the Kālasūtra Hell, third, the Saṃghāta Hell, fourth, the Raurava Hell, fifth, the Mahāraurava Hell, sixth, the Tapana Hell, seventh, the Pratāpana Hell, eighth, the Avīci Hell.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b11_15']	言洲異者，謂四大洲，一南贍部洲、二東勝身洲、三西牛貨洲、四北俱盧洲。	言洲異者，謂四大洲，一南贍部洲、二東勝身洲、三西牛貨洲、四北俱盧洲。	As for the different continents, there are the four great continents: first, Jambudvīpa in the south, second, Pūrvavideha in the east, third, Aparagodānīya in the west, fourth, Uttarakuru in the north.

['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b16_13']	器及有情總名色界。	器及有情總名色界。	The physical world and sentient beings are collectively called the form realm.

['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b21_17']	第四靜慮處有八者，一無雲天、二福生天、三廣果天，并五淨居處合成八。	第四靜慮處有八者，一無雲天、二福生天、三廣果天，并五淨居處合成八。	The fourth meditative absorption having eight locations, the first is the Cloudless Heaven, the second is the Heaven of Increasing Merit, the third is the Heaven of Vast Fruit, and the five pure abodes together make eight.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b23_7']	五淨居者，一無繁天、二無熱天、三善現天、四善見天、五色究竟天。	五淨居者，一無繁天、二無熱天、三善現天、四善見天、五色究竟天。	The five pure abodes are the heavens of No Affliction, No Heat, Good Appearance, Good Vision, and Ultimate Form.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b24_6']	此十六處諸器世間并諸有情，總名色界。	此十六處諸器世間并諸有情，總名色界。	These sixteen places, together with the physical worlds and sentient beings, are collectively called the form realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b26_6']	何緣大梵及無想天，無壽量等殊，不別建立，不應別立大梵一故，要依同分立天處名。	何緣大梵及無想天，無壽量等殊，不別建立，不應別立大梵一故，要依同分立天處名。	Why are the life spans, etc., of the great brahma heaven and the heaven of non-perceptual beings not distinguished and not established separately? They should not be separately established because the great brahma heaven is not a single unit. The name of a heavenly realm is established on the basis of a single unit of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829b28_13']	非一梵王可名同分，雖壽量等與餘不同，然由一身不成同分，故與梵輔合立一天，高下雖異然地無別。	非一梵王可名同分，雖壽量等與餘不同，然由一身不成同分，故與梵輔合立一天，高下雖異然地無別。	The single king of the great brahma heaven cannot be called a single unit. Although his life span, etc., are not the same as those of other heavens, still, since a single body does not constitute a single unit, he is combined with the brahma assistants to establish a single heaven. Although there is a difference in height, there is no difference in the ground.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c01_7']	無想有情與彼廣果，壽身量等無差別故，亦無異因，故不可立為第四處。	無想有情與彼廣果，壽身量等無差別故，亦無異因，故不可立為第四處。	Because the life span and size of the body of non-perceptual beings are the same as those of the heaven of vast fruit, there is no difference. There is also no different cause, so it cannot be established as a fourth place.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c02_15']	無色界中都無方處，以無色法去來無表皆無方所，理決定故。	無色界中都無方處，以無色法去來無表皆無方所，理決定故。	In the formless realm, there is no location at all, because formless dharmas, past and future, and non-indicative form all have no location. This is definitely so according to principle.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c03_10']	但異熟生勝劣差別，說有四種：	但異熟生勝劣差別，說有四種：	However, there are four kinds of superior and inferior distinctions in the form of karmic maturation.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c04_17']	一空無邊處、二識無邊處、三無所有處、四非想非非想處。	一空無邊處、二識無邊處、三無所有處、四非想非非想處。	The first is the sphere of infinite space, the second is the sphere of infinite consciousness, the third is the sphere of nothingness, and the fourth is the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c05_16']	如是四種名無色界，由生勝劣，非由方所。	如是四種名無色界，由生勝劣，非由方所。	These four kinds are called the formless realm. They are distinguished by the superiority and inferiority of birth, not by location.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c06_14']	以於是處得彼定者，命終即於是處生故。	以於是處得彼定者，命終即於是處生故。	Because those who attain concentration in this place, when their life ends, are born in this very place.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c07_13']	復從彼歿生欲色時，即於是處中有起故。	復從彼歿生欲色時，即於是處中有起故。	And when they die and are reborn in the desire or form realms, the intermediate existence arises in this very place.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c09_2']	由漸離欲漸得彼定，及生劣勝次第如是，隨生因力果少多故。	由漸離欲漸得彼定，及生劣勝次第如是，隨生因力果少多故。	Because they gradually detach from desire and gradually attain that concentration, and because birth is inferior or superior, the order is like this. Because the power of the cause of birth is small or great, the result is also small or great.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c10_1']	於無色界受生有情，以何為依心等相續？	於無色界受生有情，以何為依心等相續？	What do sentient beings born in the formless realm take as their support for the continuity of mind and so forth?
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c10_10']	何緣於此欻復生疑？	何緣於此欻復生疑？	What is the reason for suddenly giving rise to doubt again?
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c11_1']	以諸法中都無有我。	以諸法中都無有我。	Because there is absolutely no self among all dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c11_19']	心心所法在欲色界，依託色身可相續轉；	心心所法在欲色界，依託色身可相續轉；	The mind and mental factors in the desire and form realms can continue and evolve by relying on a physical body;
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c12_17']	於無色界既無色身，心等應無相續轉義。	於無色界既無色身，心等應無相續轉義。	Since there is no material body in the formless realm, mind and so on should not have the meaning of a continuous series.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c15_18']	為顯彼有依故作是說，依同分及命心等相續，及聲攝餘不相應行，謂得及非得、異生性、生等法轉所賴故名為依，心等轉時要託彼故。	為顯彼有依故作是說，依同分及命心等相續，及聲攝餘不相應行，謂得及非得、異生性、生等法轉所賴故名為依，心等轉時要託彼故。	In order to show that they have a support, it is said that mind and so on continue in a series supported by the similarity of species and the vitality faculty. The word “and” includes the other non-associated formative forces, that is, acquisition, non-acquisition, the nature of being an ordinary person, birth, etc., because they are relied on by dharmas in a series. They are called supports because mind and so on must rely on them in order to continue in a series.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c21_3']	眼等四識一一皆用無間滅意及自色根為其所依及為依性，以自色根所依大種身根及大同分命根得等生等但為依性，身識即用意及身根為其所依及為依性，但以身根所依大種同分命根得等生等為其依性非為所依。	眼等四識一一皆用無間滅意及自色根為其所依及為依性，以自色根所依大種身根及大同分命根得等生等但為依性，身識即用意及身根為其所依及為依性，但以身根所依大種同分命根得等生等為其依性非為所依。	The four consciousnesses of eye, etc., each have as their support and as their dominant condition the immediately antecedent cessation of mind and their own material organs. The material organs, the body organ, the similarity of species, the vitality faculty, acquisition, etc., and birth, etc., are only dominant conditions, because the body consciousness uses mind and the body organ as its support and dominant condition, but only uses the great elements that are the support of the body organ, the similarity of species, the vitality faculty, acquisition, etc., and birth, etc., as dominant conditions, not as a support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c23_1']	意識但以無間滅意為其所依及為依性，身根及大同分命根得等生等但為依性。	意識但以無間滅意為其所依及為依性，身根及大同分命根得等生等但為依性。	The sixth consciousness has as its support the immediately past mind, and this mind is its support and dominant condition. The body, faculties, species, life, and so on are only dominant conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c24_1']	如是欲色有情心等，依色同分命等相續。	如是欲色有情心等，依色同分命等相續。	Thus the minds of sentient beings in the realm of desire and the realm of form are supported by form, by species, life, and so on, and continue in a series.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c25_9']	無色有情以無色故，但依同分及命根等心等相續，非無有依。	無色有情以無色故，但依同分及命根等心等相續，非無有依。	Since sentient beings in the formless realm have no form, their minds are supported only by species and life and continue in a series. This does not mean that they have no support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c26_18']	依與所依二相別者，要由彼有此方得轉、無則不轉，是為依相。	依與所依二相別者，要由彼有此方得轉、無則不轉，是為依相。	The difference between a support and a supported dharma is that the supported dharma arises and is manifested only when the support exists and does not when the support does not exist. This is the characteristic of a support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c27_16']	定有彼相及隨變者，是謂為依及所依相。	定有彼相及隨變者，是謂為依及所依相。	That which definitely has the characteristic of a support and is subject to change is called a support and has the characteristic of a supported dharma.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0829c29_6']	雖彼諸法為心等依，而或有時心等不轉，此由別法為障礙故。	雖彼諸法為心等依，而或有時心等不轉，此由別法為障礙故。	Even though these dharmas are the support of mind, etc., sometimes mind, etc., is not manifested because of the obstruction of other dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a01_6']	心等轉位必有彼依，故彼得為心等依相。	心等轉位必有彼依，故彼得為心等依相。	When mind, etc., is manifested, it must have a support, and therefore it is said that these dharmas are the support of mind, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a03_5']	現見心等於死身內畢竟不生，於生身中雖暫時滅而定當起，故彼色等依相極成。	現見心等於死身內畢竟不生，於生身中雖暫時滅而定當起，故彼色等依相極成。	We actually see that mind and so on are definitely not born in a dead body, and although they temporarily cease in a living body, they will definitely arise again. Therefore the characteristics of the support of form and so on are well established.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a05_3']	由此故知，色聲香等於心心所不能為依，以外事中有色聲等然心心所曾不轉故。	由此故知，色聲香等於心心所不能為依，以外事中有色聲等然心心所曾不轉故。	Consequently, we know that form, sound, smell, and so on are not supports for mind and its activities, because in external events there is form, sound, and so on, but mind and its activities never evolve there.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a06_6']	心等不隨無間滅意定有轉變，如何可說彼為所依？	心等不隨無間滅意定有轉變，如何可說彼為所依？	Mind and so on do not definitely evolve in accordance with the immediately antecedent condition of manas. How can you say that manas is their support?
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a07_10']	夫隨變者謂令改易，由前意滅後心等起，何非所依？	夫隨變者謂令改易，由前意滅後心等起，何非所依？	That which evolves in accordance with something is that which is transformed by it. Because manas ceases and mind and so on arise, why is manas not a support?
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a08_19']	非同分等為心等依，如眼等根無間滅意，故所依相與依相別。	非同分等為心等依，如眼等根無間滅意，故所依相與依相別。	The same is not true of the mind and so on of the same species and so on, which are supports for mind and so on, as is the case with the immediately antecedent condition of manas. Therefore the characteristics of the support are different from the characteristics of a support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a10_7']	如是欲色諸有情心，四蘊俱生滅為依性，唯一色蘊得為所依。	如是欲色諸有情心，四蘊俱生滅為依性，唯一色蘊得為所依。	Thus the minds of sentient beings in the realms of desire and form are born and perish with the four aggregates as their nature as a support, but only the form aggregate is capable of being a support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a11_6']	酒等惱時心雖轉變，而無意識色為所依。	酒等惱時心雖轉變，而無意識色為所依。	Even when the mind is transformed by the disturbance of wine and so on, there is no consciousness that has form as a support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a13_4']	夫成所依定能生變，意識非定隨色變生，以無色時心亦有故，可為依性非作所依。	夫成所依定能生變，意識非定隨色變生，以無色時心亦有故，可為依性非作所依。	The consciousness that is supported and produced by the sameness and stability of the transformation of the sense base is not necessarily transformed and produced by the transformation of form, because even when there is no form, mind still exists. It can be the nature of a support, but it does not act as a support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a14_3']	是故六識在欲色界，得以四蘊為俱生依。	是故六識在欲色界，得以四蘊為俱生依。	Therefore, in the desire realm and the form realm, the six consciousnesses are born with the four aggregates as their simultaneous support.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a15_2']	無色意識以無色故，彼俱生依唯通三蘊。	無色意識以無色故，彼俱生依唯通三蘊。	In the formless realm, mental consciousness is born with only the three aggregates as its simultaneous support, because it has no form.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a16_1']	若爾，何故但言無色心等依於同分及命？	若爾，何故但言無色心等依於同分及命？	If this is so, why does the Abhidharmasamuccaya-vyākhyā say that the formless mind, etc., are supported by sameness of species and life?
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a17_9']	此說定同無亂依故，謂心心所雖互為依而非定同，不自依故；	此說定同無亂依故，謂心心所雖互為依而非定同，不自依故；	It is said that they definitely have the same support and are not confused. That is, although mind and its activities are mutual supports, they are not necessarily the same, because they do not support themselves.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a18_7']	亦非無亂，在此地生，亂起自他心心所故。	亦非無亂，在此地生，亂起自他心心所故。	Also, they are not confused, because when one is born in a certain stage, the mind and its activities of that stage are born and not those of other stages.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a18_17']	同分及命，心等同依。	同分及命，心等同依。	Sameness of species and life are the same support for mind, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a19_6']	又此地生唯此地故。	又此地生唯此地故。	Also, when one is born in a certain stage, only the mind, etc., of that stage are born.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a21_13']	依此設起不同地心，由此還令自地心起，唯依此二名此地生，牽引業生無間斷故，由斯說是同不亂依。	依此設起不同地心，由此還令自地心起，唯依此二名此地生，牽引業生無間斷故，由斯說是同不亂依。	On the basis of these two, one generates a mind of a different stage, and on the basis of these two, one generates a mind of one’s own stage. Only on the basis of these two is one said to be born in a certain stage, because the karmic result that is attracted by action is uninterrupted. Therefore these two are said to be the support that is the same and not confused.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a22_3']	心等不然，故略不說。	心等不然，故略不說。	Mind and so on are not like this, and therefore they are not mentioned.
['ZH_T29_1563_012:0830a24_5']	若無此二餘地四蘊現在前時，爾時有情應名餘地，非此地攝，自地先業所牽引果不相續故。	若無此二餘地四蘊現在前時，爾時有情應名餘地，非此地攝，自地先業所牽引果不相續故。	If these two did not exist, when the four aggregates of a different stage were present, then sentient beings would be said to belong to a different stage, and not to this stage, because the karmic result attracted by previous action of this stage would not be continuous.
