The names are established based on the superior, such as generating the mind and cultivating the practices of the pāramitās. Although they all remove hindrances, only the superior stages are used as their names. The mind of great enlightenment takes wholesome roots as its essence. Subduing the obstacles to be eliminated is called pāramitā. It can break through stinginess and even delusion, so they all remove hindrances.

These twelve obstacles arise in sequence, encompassing four and two practices, results, causes, and beginnings. This will be understood below.

First, it asks and answers about the four fruits, using them to explain leaving behind arrogance;

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b06_2']	此問四果，正人觀時，頗作是念，「我得果不」，以明離慢。	此問四果，正人觀時，頗作是念，「我得果不」，以明離慢。	This question about the four fruits is to examine whether the noble ones, when contemplating, have the thought I have attained the fruits, in order to clarify that they are free from conceit.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b08_16']	善現答中，《能斷經》內初果、後果，皆言我能得果，即為有執，中二果無，略舉初、後例中間故，餘本皆唯第四果有，例前三果。	善現答中，《能斷經》內初果、後果，皆言我能得果，即為有執，中二果無，略舉初、後例中間故，餘本皆唯第四果有，例前三果。	In Subhūti's answer, the first and last fruits in the Sutra of Cutting Off both say I can attain the fruits, which is grasping. The middle two fruits do not have this. Only the fourth fruit in the other versions has this, exemplifying the first three fruits.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b09_15']	若爾，無學尚說執生，何因有學不說執起？	若爾，無學尚說執生，何因有學不說執起？	If that is so, since even the adept still speaks of grasping arising, why don't the learners speak of grasping arising?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b10_3']	故《能斷》正。	故《能斷》正。	Therefore the Sutra of Cutting Off is correct.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b12_3']	天親疑云，「向說聖人無為得名，彼法不可取、說，若爾，云何預流果等，能自知我得彼果？	天親疑云，「向說聖人無為得名，彼法不可取、說，若爾，云何預流果等，能自知我得彼果？	Sthiramati's doubt is: It was said earlier that the noble ones are named due to non-action. Those dharmas cannot be grasped or spoken of. If so, how can the fruits of stream-entry, etc., know by themselves that I have attained those fruits?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b13_5']	」如是證為他說，即是四果可取、可說，以成疑意故。	」如是證為他說，即是四果可取、可說，以成疑意故。	 Thus to testify for oneself and speak for others is precisely that the four fruits can be grasped and spoken of. This forms the meaning of the doubt.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b15_10']	此論前卷云，為修道得勝中無慢故，經言等即彼疑同，若以無為不可取、說，云何四果言得可說？	此論前卷云，為修道得勝中無慢故，經言等即彼疑同，若以無為不可取、說，云何四果言得可說？	This treatise's previous fascicle says, In order to cultivate the path and attain supremacy without arrogance, the sūtra says... This is the same as the previous doubt. If the unconditioned cannot be grasped or spoken of, how can the four fruits be said to be attainable?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b16_10']	彼既有疑，於無得、無說之中，謂有得、說。	彼既有疑，於無得、無說之中，謂有得、說。	Since they have doubts, within non-attainment and non-speaking, they consider there to be attainment and speaking.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b18_4']	我者我慢，踞倣性故，或是我見得者，於無所得中，謂有所得功德，是邪慢說。	我者我慢，踞倣性故，或是我見得者，於無所得中，謂有所得功德，是邪慢說。	The self and self-conceit are based on the nature of imitation, or it is the view of self that attains. Within non-attainment, considering there to be attained merits is the false conceit of speaking.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b19_14']	亦如是所說，皆利眾生中所說，我見、我慢為根本故，邪慢等生。	亦如是所說，皆利眾生中所說，我見、我慢為根本故，邪慢等生。	The above explanations are all spoken within benefiting sentient beings, because the view of self and self-conceit are the fundamental causes, false conceit and so forth arise.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b20_16']	故此論言，若有我相，則為有慢等，菩薩所應斷。	故此論言，若有我相，則為有慢等，菩薩所應斷。	Therefore this treatise says, If there is the appearance of self, then there is conceit and so forth, which bodhisattvas should eliminate.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b21_15']	正是法執，舉煩惱名以顯法執，下皆唯知。	正是法執，舉煩惱名以顯法執，下皆唯知。	This is precisely the grasping of dharmas. The name of the afflictions is raised to manifest the grasping of dharmas. The following are only knowledge.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b24_4']	今此總言為離此慢故經言等，意顯入證無為之時，四果皆不言我得、我說，出觀已後方言我能證得此果。	今此總言為離此慢故經言等，意顯入證無為之時，四果皆不言我得、我說，出觀已後方言我能證得此果。	Now, this general statement is made in order to avoid this conceit. The meaning of the sūtra passage is that at the time of entering and realizing the unconditioned, the four fruits are all not said to be attained or spoken by oneself. After emerging from contemplation, one speaks of one's own ability to realize and attain this fruit.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b27_4']	又後得智觀前所證，所證深妙，觀之不著，觀證前加行行相，逐依行相而宣說之，言有得證，非實真智正證無為言有得證。	又後得智觀前所證，所證深妙，觀之不著，觀證前加行行相，逐依行相而宣說之，言有得證，非實真智正證無為言有得證。	Moreover, the subsequently attained cognition observes what was previously realized. What was realized is profound and wondrous. Observing it, one does not become attached. Observing the aspects of the added practices prior to realization, one proclaims them in accordance with the observed aspects. Speaking of realization and attainment, it is not the true cognition directly realizing the unconditioned speaking of realization and attainment.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742b29_13']	前之三果若言得證，以有種子煩惱隨逐，此時雖無現行煩惱，由有種故，應二執隨生，故言即為有我等執；	前之三果若言得證，以有種子煩惱隨逐，此時雖無現行煩惱，由有種故，應二執隨生，故言即為有我等執；	As for the first three fruits, if it is said that they are realized, since there are seeds of afflictions that follow, even though at this time there are no presently operating afflictions, due to the existence of the seeds, the two kinds of self-attachment should arise. Therefore, it is said that there would be the attachment to a self, etc.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c03_11']	第四果人若有得證，唯所知障種子隨逐，正起四智，我生已盡，梵行已立等，雖非現執，由執種逐，言我等者，應法執起。	第四果人若有得證，唯所知障種子隨逐，正起四智，我生已盡，梵行已立等，雖非現執，由執種逐，言我等者，應法執起。	If there are those who attain the fourth fruit, only the seeds of the obstacle to that which is to be known remain. When the four knowledges are actually produced, my birth is ended, the holy life has been established, and so on. Although they are not presently grasped, because the seeds of grasping remain, it is said that the self and so on should arise when the grasping of dharmas arises.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c04_7']	故天親言，「以有使煩惱，非行煩惱。	故天親言，「以有使煩惱，非行煩惱。	Therefore, in the Treatise on the Stages of Yogic Practice, it says, There are afflictions of the propensities, but not the afflictions of activity.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c04_11']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c07_7']	彼於證時離取我等煩惱，是故無如是心，我能得果」等，此顯證時，若言我既證，有種隨逐，應起現行我煩惱等，如餘起時。	彼於證時離取我等煩惱，是故無如是心，我能得果」等，此顯證時，若言我既證，有種隨逐，應起現行我煩惱等，如餘起時。	Because at the time of realization, they are free from the afflictions of grasping the self and so on. Therefore, there is no such thought as 'I can attain the fruits' and so on. This shows that at the time of realization, if it is said that the self has been realized, and the seeds remain, then the actual afflictions of the self and so on should arise, just as they do when the other [graspings] arise.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c07_19']	論言「使」者，是種子故；	論言「使」者，是種子故；	The Treatise on the Stages of Yogic Practice says propensities, which means seeds.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c09_1']	四果證時，既不言取、說，明知有取之慢皆應離也。	四果證時，既不言取、說，明知有取之慢皆應離也。	At the time of realizing the four fruits, since it does not say grasping, it is clear that all the pride of grasping should be abandoned.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c09_11']	今為離此，故此文生。	今為離此，故此文生。	Now, in order to abandon this, this passage arises.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c10_6']	「須陀洹」等，羅什文別，餘經多同。	「須陀洹」等，羅什文別，餘經多同。	Stream-enterer and so on are different texts by Kumārajīva. Many other sūtras are mostly the same.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c10_16']	釋名斷或，皆如理知。	釋名斷或，皆如理知。	The explanation of the names and the elimination of doubts are all understood according to reason.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c12_6']	配四義中分三，初、解依義，次、解說相及攝持，後、解第一義。	配四義中分三，初、解依義，次、解說相及攝持，後、解第一義。	In the arrangement of the four meanings, it is divided into three parts: first, explaining the meaning of dependence; next, explaining the characteristics of explanation and inclusion; finally, explaining the ultimate meaning.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c13_10']	後釋難義中有三，初、解經文，由根本我相，方生邪慢等；	後釋難義中有三，初、解經文，由根本我相，方生邪慢等；	In the explanation of the difficult points, there are three parts: first, explaining the sutra text, because the fundamental self-view gives rise to wrong pride and so forth;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c14_3']	次、解上坐須菩提自顯所由；	次、解上坐須菩提自顯所由；	next, explaining why the elder Subhuti revealed his reasons;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c14_14']	後、解說二無諍行所以。	後、解說二無諍行所以。	finally, explaining the reason for expounding the two practices of being free from disputes.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c17_1']	自顯之中釋經，何故須菩提自顯得無諍三昧第一及阿羅漢共有功德者，謂說是離欲、離欲阿羅漢。	自顯之中釋經，何故須菩提自顯得無諍三昧第一及阿羅漢共有功德者，謂說是離欲、離欲阿羅漢。	In the self-revelation, the sutra is explained. Why did Subhuti himself reveal that he is foremost in attaining the samadhi of being free from disputes and the merits shared by arhats? It means that he is free from desires and is an arhat free from desires.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c19_4']	阿羅漢者，得無為功德，離欲得故，由離貪欲，內證無為，外行無諍，故無諍是外行，證無為是內德。	阿羅漢者，得無為功德，離欲得故，由離貪欲，內證無為，外行無諍，故無諍是外行，證無為是內德。	An arhat is one who attains the merit of being free from conditioning, because he is free from desires and attains it. By being free from craving and desires, he internally realizes the unconditioned, and externally practices being free from disputes. Therefore, being free from disputes is external practice, and realizing the unconditioned is internal virtue.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c20_4']	然羅什、流支皆言，世尊佛說得無諍及離欲；	然羅什、流支皆言，世尊佛說得無諍及離欲；	However, both Kumarajiva and Dharmaksema say that the World-Honored One, the Buddha, attained the state of no dispute and was free from desires.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c21_8']	真諦、《能斷》皆言，世尊及初三號，說得無諍，自顯離欲。	真諦、《能斷》皆言，世尊及初三號，說得無諍，自顯離欲。	Both Paramārtha and Vinītadeva say that the World-Honored One and the first three epithets attained the state of no dispute, which is a self-manifestation of being free from desires.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0742c25_14']	又諸本皆言無諍三昧，唯《能斷》言無諍住者，如八解脫中第三、第八獨言身作證具足住，餘六便無，此亦如是，顯諸三昧此為最勝，世尊為多自住，故標住名，或處定義，由含二義，故翻為住。	又諸本皆言無諍三昧，唯《能斷》言無諍住者，如八解脫中第三、第八獨言身作證具足住，餘六便無，此亦如是，顯諸三昧此為最勝，世尊為多自住，故標住名，或處定義，由含二義，故翻為住。	Moreover, all the original texts say samādhi of no dispute, while only Vinītadeva's text says abiding in no dispute. It is like the third and eighth among the eight liberations, which alone say fully abiding in physical realization, while the other six do not. This is also like that. It shows that among all the samādhis, this one is the most supreme. Since the World-Honored One often abides in it himself, it is designated as abiding. Or it is a place of definitive meaning. Because it contains two meanings, it is translated as abiding.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a01_9']	以己所證，為令信故，引此為證。	以己所證，為令信故，引此為證。	Using what he himself has realized as evidence to inspire faith.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a02_15']	天親亦言，自歎得記，以自身證果，為於彼義中生信心故。	天親亦言，自歎得記，以自身證果，為於彼義中生信心故。	Vasubandhu also says that he praises himself for attaining the prediction, using his own realization of the fruit to generate faith in that meaning.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a03_10']	何故唯說無諍一行佛多住功德？	何故唯說無諍一行佛多住功德？	Why does it only say that the Buddha often abides in the merit of the single practice of no dispute?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a04_11']	天親論為二說，一為明勝功德故，令生欣求；	天親論為二說，一為明勝功德故，令生欣求；	The treatise by Vasubandhu gives two explanations: first, to clarify the superior merits, causing one to give rise to aspiration and seeking;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a04_17']	二為生深信。	二為生深信。	second, to give rise to profound faith.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a07_4']	後解說二無諍行所以，內證真理，離我所執，住無諍理，無有少法得阿羅漢；	後解說二無諍行所以，內證真理，離我所執，住無諍理，無有少法得阿羅漢；	The latter explanation gives two reasons for the practice of non-disputation. Internally realizing true reality, free from grasping at mine, abiding in the principle of non-disputation, there is not even a trace of dharmas that can attain arhatship;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a08_1']	外住無諍，都無所行，行無諍行。	外住無諍，都無所行，行無諍行。	externally abiding in non-disputation, there is nowhere to practice, practicing the practice of non-disputation.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a10_1']	由理及行二種無諍故，經重說「無諍、無諍行」，以無少法及無所行，名為安立第一義也。	由理及行二種無諍故，經重說「無諍、無諍行」，以無少法及無所行，名為安立第一義也。	Because of the two kinds of non-disputation, namely principle and practice, the sūtra repeats non-disputation, non-disputatious practice. Being free from even a trace of dharmas and nowhere to practice is called the establishment of the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a11_20']	天親云，「依彼善吉者，說離二種障」者，一、煩惱障，二、三昧障，離彼二障故，言無所行；	天親云，「依彼善吉者，說離二種障」者，一、煩惱障，二、三昧障，離彼二障故，言無所行；	Vasubandhu says, Relying on Subhūti, he speaks of being free from two kinds of obstructions: first, the afflictive obstructions; second, the obstructions to samādhi. Because he is free from those two obstructions, it is said that he has nowhere to practice;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a12_8']	二障現前，有所行故。	二障現前，有所行故。	because when the two obstructions are present, there is somewhere to practice.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a14_18']	由離煩惱障，內證真理，得理無諍，此之功德，諸阿羅漢皆悉共有，故此論言，「及阿羅漢共有功德」，名初無諍；	由離煩惱障，內證真理，得理無諍，此之功德，諸阿羅漢皆悉共有，故此論言，「及阿羅漢共有功德」，名初無諍；	Because of being free from the obstacle of afflictions, internally realizing true reality, attaining principle without dispute, this merit is all shared by all arhats, therefore this treatise says, And the merits shared by arhats are called the first principle without dispute;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a15_14']	離三昧障，及外住彼定而行，名後無諍。	離三昧障，及外住彼定而行，名後無諍。	Being free from the obstacle of samādhi, and externally abiding in that samādhi while practicing, is called the later principle without dispute.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a17_6']	彼依離二論障說二，此論依得理、事二無諍故，重說二定，故不相違。	彼依離二論障說二，此論依得理、事二無諍故，重說二定，故不相違。	They rely on being free from the two obstacles of debate to speak of the two, this treatise relies on attaining the principle and phenomena of the two without dispute, therefore it repeats the two samādhis, thus there is no contradiction.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a24_9']	」今此論意，言有取、說者，由不遇善友，離佛出世，法不廣聞解，由少聞故，言於彼時此佛、彼佛有取、有說。	」今此論意，言有取、說者，由不遇善友，離佛出世，法不廣聞解，由少聞故，言於彼時此佛、彼佛有取、有說。	The meaning of this treatise is that those who have grasping and say so are due to not encountering good friends, being apart from the Buddha's appearance in the world, and not widely hearing and understanding the Dharma. Due to little learning, they say that at that time this Buddha or that Buddha has grasping and saying.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a25_2']	今為除此少聞之障，故有下經。	今為除此少聞之障，故有下經。	Now, in order to remove this obstacle of little learning, there is the following sutra.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a26_1']	前卷為外不遇善友，故有下經令逢善友；	前卷為外不遇善友，故有下經令逢善友；	In the previous scroll, it is because of not encountering good friends externally that there is the following sutra, which causes one to meet good friends;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a27_9']	此卷為內有所知障，𨷂多聞故，有少聞障，故說下經，令學多聞。	此卷為內有所知障，𨷂多聞故，有少聞障，故說下經，令學多聞。	In this scroll, it is because internally there are obstacles to what is to be known, and due to much learning there is the obstacle of little learning, so the following sutra is spoken, causing one to study much learning.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743a29_2']	故經中說，「多聞能斷或，多聞能引樂，多聞捨無義，多聞得涅槃」。	故經中說，「多聞能斷或，多聞能引樂，多聞捨無義，多聞得涅槃」。	Therefore, the sutra says, Much learning can sever doubt, much learning can bring about joy, much learning abandons what is meaningless, much learning attains nirvana.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b01_7']	又論言，多聞熏習是出世心之種子，由此少聞是所知障。	又論言，多聞熏習是出世心之種子，由此少聞是所知障。	Moreover, the treatise says, The perfuming of much learning is the seed of the supramundane mind. Due to this, little learning is an obstacle to what is to be known.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b03_4']	疑生通二障，牒彼論疑從前起，此論依自少聞不逢善友，各望一義，亦不相違。	疑生通二障，牒彼論疑從前起，此論依自少聞不逢善友，各望一義，亦不相違。	Doubt arises from both hindrances, referring to the treatise's explanation that doubt arises from the previous [two hindrances]. This treatise, based on one's own little learning and not encountering good friends, each looking at one meaning, is also not contradictory.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b05_4']	若遇善友，得逢諸佛，廣學多聞，便知釋迦於燃燈佛所，真實義中無少法可得，不生分別；	若遇善友，得逢諸佛，廣學多聞，便知釋迦於燃燈佛所，真實義中無少法可得，不生分別；	If one encounters good friends, meets the Buddhas, studies widely and hears much, then one will know that Śākyamuni, in the true reality, had nothing to attain, and did not give rise to discrimination;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b06_8']	言於彼時有取、有說，起此分別，由不遇佛，有少聞障；	言於彼時有取、有說，起此分別，由不遇佛，有少聞障；	Saying that at that time there was grasping and speaking, giving rise to this discrimination, is due to not encountering the Buddha, having the hindrance of little learning;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b07_8']	為令遇善友離分別障而學多聞，故經文起。	為令遇善友離分別障而學多聞，故經文起。	In order to cause one to encounter good friends, leave the hindrance of discrimination, and study widely and hear much, therefore the sūtra text arises.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b08_15']	世俗諦中有得、有說，勝義諦中便無此事，二論三文各望一說。	世俗諦中有得、有說，勝義諦中便無此事，二論三文各望一說。	In the conventional truth there is attainment and there is speaking, in the ultimate truth this matter is not present. The two treatises and three texts each look at one meaning and speak.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b11_3']	諸本皆同，唯流支本云，「昔在燃燈所，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法不」，有是意，「於勝義諦中，有所得不？	諸本皆同，唯流支本云，「昔在燃燈所，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法不」，有是意，「於勝義諦中，有所得不？	All the original texts are the same, only the text by *Purnavardhana says, In the past, at the place of Dipankara, did you attain the Dharma of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi? There is this meaning, In the ultimate truth, is there anything to attain?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b13_2']	」說此本緣，如《過去現在因果經》第一，善慧仙人作五夢等，《婆沙論》有少不同，疏中當解。	」說此本緣，如《過去現在因果經》第一，善慧仙人作五夢等，《婆沙論》有少不同，疏中當解。	The explanation of this original cause is like the first chapter of the Sutra on Past and Present Causes and Effects, where the sage of good wisdom had five dreams, etc. The *Mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra has a slightly different explanation, which will be analyzed in the commentary.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b16_8']	第三為離小攀緣作念修道中，天親疑云，聖人既以無為得名，不可取、說，云何諸菩薩取嚴淨土，佛為說之？	第三為離小攀緣作念修道中，天親疑云，聖人既以無為得名，不可取、說，云何諸菩薩取嚴淨土，佛為說之？	In the third, to avoid the small grasping and conceptualization, in the cultivation of the path, Vasubandhu has a doubt, saying, since the sages are named based on the unconditioned, which cannot be grasped or spoken of, how can the bodhisattvas grasp and purify the land, and the Buddha speak of it?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b19_8']	即前卷為願佛淨土，小菩薩所修行願，此佛淨土，是小攀緣作念修道，求生淨土，作淨相求，即令眾生欲生西方，皆作此願；	即前卷為願佛淨土，小菩薩所修行願，此佛淨土，是小攀緣作念修道，求生淨土，作淨相求，即令眾生欲生西方，皆作此願；	It is said in the previous chapter that the pure land of the Buddha is the vow and practice of the small bodhisattvas. This pure land of the Buddha is the path of cultivation with small grasping and conceptualization. Seeking to be born in the pure land, seeking the pure characteristics, is to cause sentient beings who wish to be born in the Western Pure Land to all make this vow;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b21_12']	今為離此小念修道，故有下經文，實願生淨土，應修無相嚴淨自心，廣如《無垢稱經》說嚴土相。	今為離此小念修道，故有下經文，實願生淨土，應修無相嚴淨自心，廣如《無垢稱經》說嚴土相。	Now, in order to be free from this small thought and cultivate the path, there is the following sutra text. If one truly wishes to be born in the Pure Land, one should cultivate the adornment of the formless mind, as extensively explained in the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b22_18']	天親疑從前起此卷願及色形，前卷願生嚴相，亦不相違。	天親疑從前起此卷願及色形，前卷願生嚴相，亦不相違。	Asanga's doubts arise from the previous chapter's vows and the form of the body. The vows and adornments of the previous chapter are also not contradictory.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b23_18']	小攀緣者，執有色相而修淨土，亦是法執；	小攀緣者，執有色相而修淨土，亦是法執；	The small object of clinging refers to grasping at form and characteristics while cultivating the Pure Land, which is also the grasping of dharmas;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b24_13']	貪愛生故，亦是煩惱，是此論意。	貪愛生故，亦是煩惱，是此論意。	Because of the arising of craving and attachment, it is also afflictions, which is the meaning of this treatise.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b25_7']	彼從前無為疑起，故不相違。	彼從前無為疑起，故不相違。	Their doubts arise from the previous chapter's non-action, so they are not contradictory.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b26_19']	經文分二，初、明嚴淨土，勸捨有相果莊嚴；	經文分二，初、明嚴淨土，勸捨有相果莊嚴；	The sutra text is divided into two parts. First, it clarifies the adornment and purification of the land, encouraging the abandonment of the adornments of the fruition with characteristics;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b27_11']	後、勸生心，令修無相因之飾。	後、勸生心，令修無相因之飾。	Later, it encourages the arising of the mind, causing the cultivation of the adornments of the formless cause.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b28_6']	論文分二，初、配屬經，勸捨有相；	論文分二，初、配屬經，勸捨有相；	The treatise is divided into two parts. First, it matches the sutra and encourages the abandonment of the formless;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743b28_17']	後、敘分別，令修無相。	後、敘分別，令修無相。	Later, it narrates the distinctions, causing the cultivation of the formless.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c01_2']	《佛地經》云，「勝出世間善根所起，廣大自在淨識為相」；	《佛地經》云，「勝出世間善根所起，廣大自在淨識為相」；	The Buddha Land Treatise says, It arises from supramundane wholesome roots, and its characteristic is the pure consciousness that is vast and sovereign.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c03_13']	天親論云，「智習唯識通，如是取佛土，非形第一體，非嚴莊嚴意」，上半偈解第二令修無相文，下半偈解初勸捨有相文。	天親論云，「智習唯識通，如是取佛土，非形第一體，非嚴莊嚴意」，上半偈解第二令修無相文，下半偈解初勸捨有相文。	Vasubandhu's treatise says, By cultivating the understanding of consciousness-only in this way, one takes the Buddha land. It is not the foremost substance of form, but the intention to adorn the adornments. The first half of the verse explains the second encouragement to cultivate the formless, and the second half of the verse explains the first encouragement to abandon the formed.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c06_15']	學無分別智，善根為因，內證法身法性真土、無相理土，既圓無相，報土便滿，不可智知，不可言說，外為利物，方現他受用土及變化土故。	學無分別智，善根為因，內證法身法性真土、無相理土，既圓無相，報土便滿，不可智知，不可言說，外為利物，方現他受用土及變化土故。	Cultivating non-discriminating cognition, wholesome roots as the cause, internally realizing the Dharma body, the true nature of the Dharma land, the principle land without characteristics, already perfect and formless, the reward land is then fulfilled, cannot be known by cognition, cannot be spoken, externally for the sake of benefiting beings, then manifesting the other-enjoyment land and transformation land.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c08_22']	諸淨土淨識為相，勝善根為因，故成佛時，殊勝眾生復感淨剎，故《維摩》云，欲嚴佛土，先嚴自心。	諸淨土淨識為相，勝善根為因，故成佛時，殊勝眾生復感淨剎，故《維摩》云，欲嚴佛土，先嚴自心。	All pure lands are characterized by the pure consciousness, and are caused by the supreme wholesome roots. Therefore, when one becomes a Buddha, supreme beings again experience the pure realm. Therefore, the Vimalakirti Sutra says, If one wishes to adorn the Buddha land, one should first adorn one's own mind.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c11_7']	初學不知以五塵為土體，發願希求，小念修道，而行有相，今為除此初學疑生初文，起非形莊嚴為第一嚴。	初學不知以五塵為土體，發願希求，小念修道，而行有相，今為除此初學疑生初文，起非形莊嚴為第一嚴。	Beginners do not know that the five sense objects are the essence of the land. They make vows and aspirations, cultivate the path with small thoughts, and their practice has characteristics. Now, in order to remove this doubt of beginners, the first text is initiated, taking non-form and non-appearance as the first adornment.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c13_12']	真莊嚴者，習無相識，真實智慧便通無相清淨佛土，佛依無相以為舍故，言莊嚴土，為不實語。	真莊嚴者，習無相識，真實智慧便通無相清淨佛土，佛依無相以為舍故，言莊嚴土，為不實語。	The true adornment is to cultivate the cognition of no characteristics and true wisdom, which then penetrates the land of the Buddha of no characteristics and purity. Because the Buddha relies on no characteristics as his abode, it is said that adorning the land is not true speech.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c14_8']	天親論解，以無相、有相莊嚴，故重標。	天親論解，以無相、有相莊嚴，故重標。	The Tianpin lun explains it as the adornment of no characteristics and characteristics, so it is restated.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c15_14']	《能斷經》中雙牒雙結，流支雙牒單結，真諦、羅什皆單牒結。	《能斷經》中雙牒雙結，流支雙牒單結，真諦、羅什皆單牒結。	In the Lengjia jing, it is both cited and concluded, while Liuzhi cites it but does not conclude it. Zhendi and Rashi both cite it but do not conclude it.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c17_8']	所言「即非莊嚴」者，以有相嚴非真莊嚴故，淨土差別有三有四，如章中說。	所言「即非莊嚴」者，以有相嚴非真莊嚴故，淨土差別有三有四，如章中說。	As for it is not adornment, it is because the adornment with characteristics is not true adornment. There are three or four distinctions in the pure land, as explained in the chapter.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c19_1']	解第二文有三，初、標令修無相，應無所住生心；	解第二文有三，初、標令修無相，應無所住生心；	The explanation of the second text has three parts. First, it is stated that the cultivation of no characteristics should be practiced, and the mind should arise without abiding.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c23_10']	諸本意說，以麁五塵為淨土體而修求者，非真嚴土，故但令其不住五塵；	諸本意說，以麁五塵為淨土體而修求者，非真嚴土，故但令其不住五塵；	The meaning of the other versions is that those who cultivate and seek the essence of the Pure Land with the coarse five sense objects are not truly adorning the land, so they are only told not to dwell in the five sense objects;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0743c25_17']	《能斷經》具說，住五塵及住非五塵、餘五蘊等，但生住著而求淨土，皆非真嚴，要無住著習真智者為真嚴故。	《能斷經》具說，住五塵及住非五塵、餘五蘊等，但生住著而求淨土，皆非真嚴，要無住著習真智者為真嚴故。	The Sutra on Cutting Off fully explains dwelling in the five sense objects and dwelling in non-five sense objects, and the other five aggregates, etc., but those who seek the Pure Land with attachment are not truly adorning it. Those who cultivate true wisdom without dwelling or attachment are truly adorning it.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0744a03_13']	由同內有情及外器界出淨土體故，不住二身，不住具足，是此嚴淨土，義門廣大，不可略說，廣如《淨土章無垢疏》解。	由同內有情及外器界出淨土體故，不住二身，不住具足，是此嚴淨土，義門廣大，不可略說，廣如《淨土章無垢疏》解。	Because the essence of the Pure Land comes from the inner sentient beings and the outer environment, not dwelling in the two bodies and not dwelling in completeness is the meaning of adorning and purifying the Pure Land. The meaning gates are vast and cannot be explained briefly. They are explained in detail in the commentary on the chapter on the Pure Land by Master Wugou.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0744a05_2']	《能斷》云，功德莊嚴佛土，直示嚴者無勝德故，遂增功德莊嚴佛土。	《能斷》云，功德莊嚴佛土，直示嚴者無勝德故，遂增功德莊嚴佛土。	The *Vinayaviniścayopāliparipṛcchā-sūtra says, Adorning the Buddha land with merit directly indicates that the adornments have no superior qualities, and thus it increases the merit to adorn the Buddha land.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0744a08_9']	第四為離捨眾生中，天親云，若諸聖人無為得名，云何受樂報佛取自法王身，云何餘世間復取彼是法王身耶？	第四為離捨眾生中，天親云，若諸聖人無為得名，云何受樂報佛取自法王身，云何餘世間復取彼是法王身耶？	In the fourth, to avoid abandoning sentient beings, Vasubandhu says, If the sages are named according to their unconditioned attainment, how does the reward-body Buddha take on his own Dharma-king body? How do others in the world also take on that Dharma-king body?
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0744a10_9']	此疑報身能取自體勝身、大身，他人亦取為勝、大之身，能化眾生有，非聖人無為得名；	此疑報身能取自體勝身、大身，他人亦取為勝、大之身，能化眾生有，非聖人無為得名；	This doubt is that the reward-body can take on its own superior body, great body, and others also take on that superior, great body, which can benefit sentient beings, but sages are not named according to their unconditioned attainment;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0744a11_19']	若以無為得名，不取勝大身者，便無諸佛利眾生事，即成諸法斷滅；	若以無為得名，不取勝大身者，便無諸佛利眾生事，即成諸法斷滅；	If one is named according to unconditioned attainment but does not take on a superior, great body, then there would be no buddhas benefiting sentient beings, and it would amount to the annihilation of all dharmas;
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0744a12_9']	既無大身，捨利眾生。	既無大身，捨利眾生。	Since there would be no great body, it would abandon benefiting sentient beings.

Now, in order to avoid this discrimination and attachment, there is the following sutra.

For this reason, the essence of the self truly exists, because it does not depend on other conditions to abide.

Contemplating the coarse and combined body, taking the most subtle atoms as its cause, since the coarse is neither real nor combined, one does not think of the most subtle atoms as truly existent, because they are both the function of wisdom.

Now, it destroys the four aggregates and does not include the inanimate, so it is called sentient beings. Although it takes the five aggregates as the general term for sentient beings, it is simply explaining the specific names of the four aggregates.

Now, clarifying the contemplation and destruction, it again mentions the middle, and therefore only explains the four aggregates as the body, which is called the sentient beings' world.🔽The expedient means of not contemplating the body means that because the aggregate of form has coarse and fine, the previous explanation of the subtle dust in the world system reveals that the coarse form of the world is not true, and it further says that it is not subtle dust, and then explains that the fine form is also not real.

The third here is that the merit produced by giving causes the arising of afflictions, like the dust in the realms. Prajñā is not like this. Therefore the treatise says, That merit of precious things and so forth is the cause of afflictions, because it can accomplish the affairs of afflictions.

The afflictions produced by that worldly merit are also very numerous, like the dust motes caused by the worlds. Because this worldly merit accomplishes the affairs of afflictions, it can give rise to the two kinds of bonds of afflictions: the object-based bond and the concomitant bond, therefore it is called the affairs of afflictions.

The two kinds of merit produced are the fruits of the Dharma body. Since they are truly existent, how much more so can they extinguish all afflictions and be not the cause of afflictions? Therefore, the merit of upholding and expounding surpasses the fruits of material giving.

In cultivating the right path, one cultivates both merit and wisdom. The Treatise on the Adornment of the Sage's Intent says, The two provisions of merit and wisdom, the bodhisattva skillfully cultivates without limit. Having well contemplated and decided the Dharma, one quickly understands the meaning of the words. Therefore, lacking merit is not having the complete provisions.

This reveals that upholding and expounding attains the true Dharma body bodhi externally manifesting various characteristics, and because of upholding and expounding, one will attain the holy path, which can sever the merit of giving.

First, explaining the sutra's statement: Leaving behind all characteristics, causing bodhisattvas to study.

Now, in the fifth, it again encourages the bodhisattvas who do not give rise to diligence to give rise to a sense of shame, therefore it is called the second place to give rise to a sense of shame.

The wisdom of this sutra is the practice of signlessness, which is supreme and the path that can reach bodhisattvas, unlike the rest.

Therefore, one cannot endure the suffering of transmigration in the cycle of birth and death, and then one will not be able to abandon birth and death, and will become attached to nirvāṇa, not giving rise to the great aspiration.

Without abandoning saṃsāra and saving and liberating, one then becomes attached to nirvāṇa and gives rise to a small mind, or completely slanders and falls into wrong views, always dwelling in saṃsāra, therefore not arousing the mind.

It is said that if one is attached to various objective characteristics such as form, then in the process of transmigration, one will increase fatigue, and thus the mind of enlightenment will not arise.

Therefore, the Deep Secret Sutra says in verse, The bondage of characteristics binds sentient beings, and also due to the bondage of grossness and heaviness, one skillfully cultivates both calming and contemplation, and only then is one liberated from both. It is like observing the characteristics of a playful object, constraining the mind and indulging in it without end, and then giving rise to exhaustion. Later, after resting, one only then feels tired. The characteristics of constraining the mind and giving rise to exhaustion are also like this.

In order to accomplish this meaning, one should give rise to a mind that abides nowhere, because abiding in emptiness and abiding in existence are both inappropriate.

The mind that is generated should also accord with the principle of non-abiding.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0752a26_5']	偈云，「修行利眾生，如是因當識，眾生及事相，遠離亦應知」，此說利益是因體故，彼行利益眾生，非取眾生相事，故雖利生亦成不住。	偈云，「修行利眾生，如是因當識，眾生及事相，遠離亦應知」，此說利益是因體故，彼行利益眾生，非取眾生相事，故雖利生亦成不住。	The verse says, The practice of benefiting sentient beings should be recognized as such a cause. The characteristics of sentient beings and affairs should be known as being far removed. This is because benefiting is said to be the essence of the cause. The practice of benefiting sentient beings does not grasp at the characteristics of sentient beings and affairs, and so although benefiting sentient beings is accomplished, it is also not abiding.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0752a29_1']	由有人我，必有法我，二我既行，利益之時便為勞倦，故生疲乏。	由有人我，必有法我，二我既行，利益之時便為勞倦，故生疲乏。	Because if there is a self of persons, there must be a self of dharmas. Since the two selves are active, when benefiting others one becomes weary and thus gives rise to fatigue.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0752b05_16']	眾生事有二，一、眾生名，二、五陰事，即彼眾生能詮名相，非實體相，以名自性無實體故。	眾生事有二，一、眾生名，二、五陰事，即彼眾生能詮名相，非實體相，以名自性無實體故。	The affairs of sentient beings are twofold: first, the name of sentient beings; second, the affairs of the five aggregates. The characteristics of the name that can be used to refer to those sentient beings are not real substance characteristics, because the intrinsic nature of names has no real substance.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0752b07_5']	由是一切眾生相即非相，眾生名相無實體故，能詮名成法無我。	由是一切眾生相即非相，眾生名相無實體故，能詮名成法無我。	Therefore, the characteristics of all sentient beings are not characteristics. Because the characteristics of the name of sentient beings have no real substance, the name that can be used to refer to them becomes the non-self of dharmas.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0752b09_7']	又以五陰假名眾生，於五蘊中無眾生體，以無實故，由是一切眾生即非眾生，明人無我；	又以五陰假名眾生，於五蘊中無眾生體，以無實故，由是一切眾生即非眾生，明人無我；	Moreover, the five aggregates are provisionally named sentient beings, but within the five aggregates there is no essence of sentient beings.

The Buddhas have neither of the two, because they see the true dharma. The Buddhas see the principle of the two non-selves.

When encouraging the development of the mind and practice, sentient beings may go against it, so by contemplating the two kinds of no-self, one does not give rise to anger or resentment. Therefore, it says why is it so to slightly bring out the reason for the two kinds of no-self, and then says that the World-Honored One is free from all characteristics and so forth, which seems repetitive, but in accordance with the principle it becomes established.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754a19_12']	上離少聞，多是聞思障，除已捨令多聞，由有分別二障時時微起，俱生二障多數現前，未能別修無相修慧，由闕此故，不得證慧真正斷二執。	上離少聞，多是聞思障，除已捨令多聞，由有分別二障時時微起，俱生二障多數現前，未能別修無相修慧，由闕此故，不得證慧真正斷二執。	Above, being separated from little hearing is mostly an obstacle to hearing and contemplation. After eliminating it, one should abandon it and hear much. Due to the two obstacles of discrimination, they arise from time to time, and the two innate obstacles often appear before one. One is still unable to cultivate the wisdom of signlessness separately. Due to the lack of this, one is unable to realize the wisdom that truly eliminates the two graspings.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754a21_17']	今於修慧位中，別觀真理，觀無二取，令分別除一向不行俱生二障，亦能徵伏速入見道，故說下經。	今於修慧位中，別觀真理，觀無二取，令分別除一向不行俱生二障，亦能徵伏速入見道，故說下經。	Now, in the stage of the wisdom of practice, one separately contemplates true reality, contemplates the absence of the two graspings, causes the discrimination to be eliminated and not function in one direction, and also causes the two innate obstacles to be subdued and quickly enter the path of seeing. Therefore, the following sūtra is spoken.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754a24_16']	其闕智因，體唯智障，障修慧故，此據斷正障而說智行，以生下經，前卷據離愛味樂定，不肯修慧，為說智行，令斷定愛，以生下經。	其闕智因，體唯智障，障修慧故，此據斷正障而說智行，以生下經，前卷據離愛味樂定，不肯修慧，為說智行，令斷定愛，以生下經。	The essence of the deficiency in wisdom is only the obstacle to wisdom, because it obstructs the cultivation of discernment. This is based on directly eliminating the obstacle and speaking of the practice of wisdom, in order to generate the following sutra. The previous fascicle is based on the detachment from the enjoyment of concentration, and is unwilling to cultivate discernment, speaking of the practice of wisdom, in order to eliminate the attachment to concentration, and generate the following sutra.

The attachment to concentration is precisely the essence of the obstacle to the cultivation of discernment. Therefore, the previous and following fascicles are also not contradictory.

The taste is concentration. It is unwilling to cultivate discernment. The ability to enjoy the pleasure of concentration is precisely craving and attachment. It is able to obstruct superior discernment. It is precisely the four indeterminate retributions mentioned in other treatises.

What kind of karma does one accomplish? Thus it explains the practice. It shows that in this sutra, through reading, reciting, and upholding, one gives rise to the wisdom of cultivation. The merit and virtuous karma created by the wisdom of cultivation clarify the arising of these.

First, it explains the five dharmas that correspond to removing the obstacles of love and concentration, enabling the cultivation of wisdom that corresponds to practice, because this is the practice of contemplation;

In the first text, it is divided into three. First, it lists the five exhortations to eliminate the obstacles of distraction, next, it lists the five names, and finally, it matches the sutra for explanation.

The meaning of to grasp is the meaning of making. The Treatise on the Compendium of the Great Vehicle says that one who attains concentration is said to attain attention. What is eliminated here is the obstacle of distraction.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754b16_17']	法相應者，法謂經教，即下經文，與經相順而修作意，能除亂障，有五功德，自然發生殊勝修慧，以斷愚癡。	法相應者，法謂經教，即下經文，與經相順而修作意，能除亂障，有五功德，自然發生殊勝修慧，以斷愚癡。	In accordance with the characteristics of dharmas means the sutras and teachings, which are the sutra text below. In accordance with the sutra, one cultivates attention, which can eliminate the obstacles of distraction.

This shows that apart from this sutra, one hears from others, internally waits without forgetting, repeatedly contemplates, and the cultivation of wisdom arises.

The sutra says in the mind, In this Dharma door, the Dharma door is the teaching. Names are called the essence, which is externally hearing from others. What is heard is the teaching, because one has already heard it.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754b25_8']	因此名字，成三種法，一、受，二、持，三、讀誦，此論釋意，言受者習誦故，習諷誦也。	因此名字，成三種法，一、受，二、持，三、讀誦，此論釋意，言受者習誦故，習諷誦也。	Based on these names, three kinds of dharmas are attained: first, receiving, second, upholding, third, reading and reciting. The meaning of this treatise's explanation is that receiving means memorizing and reciting, which is memorizing and reciting.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754b26_17']	復釋經有四，已受為讀，誦持者不忘，故明記在心不忘名持。	復釋經有四，已受為讀，誦持者不忘，故明記在心不忘名持。	There is another explanation of the four in the sutra: Having received it, one reads it, recites it, and upholds it without forgetting it, so the clear memory in the mind without forgetting it is called upholding.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754b29_10']	彼云，受、持修行依總持、說，受外別有其持，合名總持，即聞持是得陀羅尼，領記不忘，初受後持得轉，故開為二；	彼云，受、持修行依總持、說，受外別有其持，合名總持，即聞持是得陀羅尼，領記不忘，初受後持得轉，故開為二；	They say: Receiving, upholding, and practicing are based on dhāraṇī and explanation. Apart from receiving, there is its upholding, which is collectively called dhāraṇī. The hearing-based upholding is obtaining dhāraṇī, comprehending and remembering without forgetting. Initially receiving and later upholding are obtained and turned, so they are opened into two.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754c02_4']	此讀之外別有一攝，觀此攝者，乃是彼持，攝持法故，十法行中更無攝行。	此讀之外別有一攝，觀此攝者，乃是彼持，攝持法故，十法行中更無攝行。	Apart from this reading, there is a separate embracing. Observing this embracing is precisely that upholding, because it embraces and upholds the Dharma. Among the ten Dharma practices, there is no further embracing practice.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754c02_20']	為受故讀者，由修諷誦，先讀其文。	為受故讀者，由修諷誦，先讀其文。	In order to receive, one reads. Due to cultivation, one first recites the text.

['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754c06_5']	彼論云，「讀誦、修行，依聞慧故，廣多讀習亦名聞慧」，即顯受外別有習誦。	彼論云，「讀誦、修行，依聞慧故，廣多讀習亦名聞慧」，即顯受外別有習誦。	That treatise says: Reading, reciting, and practicing are based on the wisdom of hearing, so extensively reading and practicing is also called the wisdom of hearing. This shows that apart from receiving, there is separate reading and recitation.

The treatise has already received and explained upholding, reading and reciting. For one who receives and upholds, the essence of the practice is total retention. Initially receiving and later upholding are therefore opened up as two. Reading and reciting are both one kind of hearing wisdom, therefore combined as one, making three kinds.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0754c12_13']	此論說四，義少難知，彼說讀誦修行依聞慧，廣多讀習亦名聞慧，與《中邊論》同，即顯少讀少解義意，是生得慧，非聞慧也。	此論說四，義少難知，彼說讀誦修行依聞慧，廣多讀習亦名聞慧，與《中邊論》同，即顯少讀少解義意，是生得慧，非聞慧也。	This treatise explains four, the meaning is slightly difficult to understand. It explains reading, reciting, and cultivation rely on hearing wisdom. Extensively reading and practicing is also called hearing wisdom, the same as the Madhyāntavibhāga. It shows that slightly reading and slightly understanding the meaning is innate wisdom, not hearing wisdom.

It shows the superior merit of comparison. The merit of giving up the body here is superior to the previous merit of giving up the body, because the matter is superior, and because the time is great, because in one day of time many bodies are given up, and also because of the many times [of giving].

Both Gunabhadra and Kumārajīva say that having faith and not going against [the Dharma] is sufficient.

If one were to give the seven treasures of the trichiliocosm, it would not be as good as upholding and expounding a single verse of the sūtra, which is immeasurable and incalculable, using the one hundred and sixth immeasurable number and the one hundred and twelfth incalculable number.
['ZH_T40_1816_002:0755a16_9']	彼文為在十行之位諸菩薩說，解行尚少，持、說未勝，所說攝淺，故以少施校於持、說。	彼文為在十行之位諸菩薩說，解行尚少，持、說未勝，所說攝淺，故以少施校於持、說。	That text was spoken for the bodhisattvas in the stage of the ten practices. Their understanding and practice are still insufficient, their upholding and expounding are not yet superior, and what they expound is still shallow, so it compares a small amount of giving to upholding and expounding.

For this reason, the treatise says, Name and entity are mutually guests, their nature should be investigated. The previous distancing from one's own grasping is in the stage of heat. Next, in the stage of summit, one again contemplates the non-existence of the grasped, thus the treatise says, One should also investigate the two, mere cognition and mere imputation.

This lack of instruction is in the stage of acceptance and the supreme worldly dharmas. In the stage of the arising of the upper acceptance, one seals the non-existence of the grasped. In the stage of the arising of the middle acceptance, one contemplates the non-existence of the grasper. After the arising of the upper acceptance, one seals the non-existence of the grasper. In the supreme worldly dharmas, one doubly seals the two emptinesses.

Suchness is merely the specific characteristic of dharmas, and therefore the attainment of the specific characteristic is called the separate knowledge of the principle of dharmas. Since the substance of those dharmas is also separately known, therefore the two cognitions of the holy ones are able to realize the two natures of the perfected and the dependent on others, and are called the attainment of real dharmas.

Because there is no first conventional truth on the dharmas of the truth of ultimate truth, the conventional truth that is grasped here is actually not the two truths. It is said to be conventional because it is conventionally conceived based on the mind.
