['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c16_14']	故《易》云「機者動之微、吉之先。	故《易》云「機者動之微、吉之先。	004	Therefore, the Book of Changes says mechanism is the subtlety of movement, the precursor of good fortune.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c17_12']	」現眾生有將生之善，此善微微將動而得為機。	」現眾生有將生之善，此善微微將動而得為機。	004	It shows that sentient beings have good that is about to arise. This good is subtly about to move and can be the mechanism.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c18_13']	今以善例惡，亦有將生微動之義，可得為機否？	今以善例惡，亦有將生微動之義，可得為機否？	004	Now, using good to illustrate evil, does it also have the meaning of subtle movement about to arise, and can it be the mechanism?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c19_3']	「答然」者，許亦是機。	「答然」者，許亦是機。	004	The answer is yes means it is also the mechanism.

['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c21_21']	不知性善有可生義，故興此問。	不知性善有可生義，故興此問。	004	Not knowing that inherent goodness has the meaning of arising, therefore this question is raised.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c22_1']	二、答。	二、答。	004	Second, the answer.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c22_18']	冥伏未現故須聖應，是善性故得將生。	冥伏未現故須聖應，是善性故得將生。	004	Since it is hidden and not yet manifest, it must rely on the sage's response. Since it is of good nature, it can be about to be born.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c23_9']	三、善惡慈悲相關義，二：	三、善惡慈悲相關義，二：	004	Third, the meaning of the connection between good, evil, compassion, and mercy, in two parts:

['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c24_1']	若善已成，不須關聖。	若善已成，不須關聖。	004	If good has already been accomplished, it does not need to be connected to the sage.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c24_11']	若關聖應，微善成著；	若關聖應，微善成著；	004	If it is connected to the sage's response, even slight good will be accomplished;
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c25_2']	惡關聖應，亦微惡成著邪？	惡關聖應，亦微惡成著邪？	004	If evil is connected to the sage's response, will even slight evil be accomplished?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c25_6']	二、答。	二、答。	004	Second, the answer.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c25_15']	聖豈成就眾生之惡？	聖豈成就眾生之惡？	004	How could the sage accomplish the evil of sentient beings?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c26_4']	但以善性法爾關慈應。	但以善性法爾關慈應。	004	It is just that the nature of good dharmas naturally connects with compassionate response.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c26_10']	則善成得樂；	則善成得樂；	004	Then good will be accomplished and one will attain happiness;
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c26_20']	惡關悲應，惡滅離苦。	惡關悲應，惡滅離苦。	004	Evil connects with compassionate response, and evil is extinguished and one is freed from suffering.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c27_9']	同體故關，非條然也。	同體故關，非條然也。	004	It is connected because of the same essence, not because of being separate.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c27_21']	四、感應相稱釋宜義，二：	四、感應相稱釋宜義，二：	004	Fourth, resolving the meaning of suitability by means of the correspondence between stimulus and response, in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c28_3']	初、問。	初、問。	004	First, the question.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c28_12']	聖智鑑機宜用何法？	聖智鑑機宜用何法？	004	What Dharma should the sage's wisdom use in examining the stimulus?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c29_1']	那將釋感云機宜邪？	那將釋感云機宜邪？	004	Why then speak of resolving the stimulus as being suitable to the stimulus?

['ZH_T34_1727_004:0919c29_15']	宜必相宜，何局於應？	宜必相宜，何局於應？	004	Suitability must be mutual suitability, how can it be limited to the response?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a01_2']	底蓋之喻，不在一邊。	底蓋之喻，不在一邊。	004	The analogy of the bottom and lid is not on one side.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a01_12']	二、一番約應簡、二：	二、一番約應簡、二：	004	Second, one round of distinctions based on responsiveness, two:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a01_21']	初、約二身無應問。	初、約二身無應問。	004	First, distinctions based on the two bodies not being responsive.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a02_6']	二、約二身俱應答。	二、約二身俱應答。	004	Second, distinctions based on both bodies being responsive.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a03_5']	法身聚集無量法門，能應眾生種種觀智。	法身聚集無量法門，能應眾生種種觀智。	004	The Dharma body gathers immeasurable Dharma gates, which can respond to sentient beings' various contemplative wisdoms.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a04_4']	應身聚集無量神變，能應眾生種種見聞。	應身聚集無量神變，能應眾生種種見聞。	004	The responsive body gathers immeasurable spiritual transformations, which can respond to sentient beings' various sights and sounds.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a04_14']	三、三番相對簡，三：	三、三番相對簡，三：	004	Third, three rounds of distinctions based on mutual comparison, three:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a05_3']	初、明感應非一異，二：	初、明感應非一異，二：	004	First, clarifying that the responsive and the aroused are neither the same nor different, two:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a05_7']	初、問；	初、問；	004	First, question;
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a05_11']	二、答。	二、答。	004	Second, answer.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a05_23']	不一故感應，不異故相關。	不一故感應，不異故相關。	004	Not the same, therefore responsive and aroused; not different, therefore mutually related.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a06_8']	二、明感應非虛實，二：	二、明感應非虛實，二：	004	Second, clarifying that the responsive and the aroused are neither false nor real, two:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a06_12']	初、問；	初、問；	004	First, question;
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a06_16']	二、答。	二、答。	004	Second, answer.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a07_10']	「云云」者，義應例上，既非一異亦非虛實。	「云云」者，義應例上，既非一異亦非虛實。	004	And so on means the meaning should be exemplified above. Since they are neither the same nor different, they are also neither false nor real.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a08_4']	然雙非虛實及非一異，須得其意。	然雙非虛實及非一異，須得其意。	004	However, the double negation of false and real, and the double negation of the same and different, must be understood.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a09_3']	心佛眾生三無差別，理本無差差約事用。	心佛眾生三無差別，理本無差差約事用。	004	The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are three without distinction. The principle is originally without distinction, but distinction is based on function.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a09_19']	三千理同故不異，迷悟事異故不一。	三千理同故不異，迷悟事異故不一。	004	The principle of the three thousand is the same, so it is not different; the events of delusion and enlightenment are different, so it is not one.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a10_13']	悟故佛法為應，迷故心生是感。	悟故佛法為應，迷故心生是感。	004	Because of enlightenment, the Buddha's teachings are the response; because of delusion, the arising of the mind is the stimulus.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a11_8']	理本一故非實，事暫異故非虛。	理本一故非實，事暫異故非虛。	004	The principle is originally one, so it is not real; the events temporarily differ, so it is not false.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a12_3']	故不二門云「幻機幻感、幻應幻赴。	故不二門云「幻機幻感、幻應幻赴。	004	Therefore, the Gate of Non-duality says, The illusory stimulus, the illusory response, the illusory response, and the illusory meeting.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a13_2']	」故地住前異相仍存，真位分分同佛體用。	」故地住前異相仍存，真位分分同佛體用。	004	Therefore, before the stages of the ten grounds, the different characteristics still exist; in the true stage, the Buddha's essence and function are partially the same.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a14_2']	至于究竟感應既亡，復何論於一異虛實？	至于究竟感應既亡，復何論於一異虛實？	004	Up to the ultimate, the stimulus and response are already gone, so how can one discuss whether they are one or different, real or false?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a14_19']	三、「以他」下，明感應難思議，二：	三、「以他」下，明感應難思議，二：	004	Third, from using others below, it clarifies that stimulus and response are difficult to fathom, in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a15_3']	初、敘他問答，二：	初、敘他問答，二：	004	First, narrating the questions and answers of others, in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a15_14']	初、疑凡聖隔異非感應。	初、疑凡聖隔異非感應。	004	First, doubting that ordinary beings and sages are separated and not in stimulus and response.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a16_2']	剋論感應，其體各別。	剋論感應，其體各別。	004	If one strictly discusses stimulus and response, their essence is each separate.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a18_2']	雖互立能所，而凡聖定分，所感是聖必非能感、所應是凡定非能應，感應分隔何名道交？	雖互立能所，而凡聖定分，所感是聖必非能感、所應是凡定非能應，感應分隔何名道交？	004	Although they mutually establish the able and the receptive, yet ordinary beings and sages are definitely divided. The stimulus is sages and definitely not the able stimulus; the response is ordinary beings and definitely not the able response. With stimulus and response divided, how can it be called the exchange of the Way?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a18_15']	二、答能所存沒故道交，二：	二、答能所存沒故道交，二：	004	Second, answering with the existence and non-existence of subject and object, there are two:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a18_22']	初、互論能所。	初、互論能所。	004	First, discussing subject and object with each other.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a19_9']	先立所感，所應不實。	先立所感，所應不實。	004	First, establishing the object to be moved, which is not real.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a19_12']	何者？	何者？	004	What is it?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a20_9']	所感非凡故不實，所應非聖故不實。	所感非凡故不實，所應非聖故不實。	004	Because the object to be moved is not ordinary, it is not real. Because the object to be responded to is not holy, it is not real.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a20_19']	次立能應，能感不實。	次立能應，能感不實。	004	Next, establishing the ability to respond, the ability to move is not real.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a21_2']	何者？	何者？	004	What is it?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a22_5']	良以還將所感為能應，所感既不實，故能應不實。	良以還將所感為能應，所感既不實，故能應不實。	004	It is precisely using the object to be moved as the ability to respond. Since the object to be moved is not real, therefore the ability to respond is not real.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a23_7']	又將所應為能感，所應既不實，故能感不實。	又將所應為能感，所應既不實，故能感不實。	004	Moreover, using the object to be responded to as the ability to move. Since the object to be responded to is not real, therefore the ability to move is not real.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a23_17']	二既不實，二亦非異。	二既不實，二亦非異。	004	Since the two are not real, the two are also not different.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a24_8']	二、「不異」下，各論存沒。	二、「不異」下，各論存沒。	004	Second, below not different, discussing existence and non-existence individually.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a24_21']	既無實無異，何名感應道交？	既無實無異，何名感應道交？	004	Since there is neither reality nor difference, what is called the intersection of the path of stimulus and response?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a26_15']	故以互存互沒而立不異而異，以由所感而為能應、所應為能感，故感應不異。	故以互存互沒而立不異而異，以由所感而為能應、所應為能感，故感應不異。	004	Therefore, using mutual existence and mutual non-existence to establish non-difference and difference, because the object to be moved becomes the ability to respond and the object to be responded to becomes the ability to move, therefore stimulus and response are not different.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a27_9']	而今聖邊沒於所感，目為能應；	而今聖邊沒於所感，目為能應；	004	Now, the sage side is submerged in what is aroused, and is called the able response;
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a28_6']	凡邊沒於所應，目為能感，故成而異。	凡邊沒於所應，目為能感，故成而異。	004	The ordinary side is submerged in what is responded to, and is called the able arousal, thus forming a difference.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a28_16']	就於而異，故有感應。	就於而異，故有感應。	004	Based on this difference, there is arousal and response.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a29_4']	就其不異，故得道交。	就其不異，故得道交。	004	Based on their non-difference, the Way can be interchanged.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920a29_17']	斯是古師情解感應及道交義。	斯是古師情解感應及道交義。	004	This is the ancient masters' understanding of the meaning of arousal and response as well as the interchange of the Way.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b01_12']	二、「私難」下，章安破立，二：	二、「私難」下，章安破立，二：	004	Second, below Privately difficult, Zhang'an refutes and establishes, in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b01_22']	初、難他義不成，二：	初、難他義不成，二：	004	First, the difficulty of the other's meaning not being established, in two:

['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b02_14']	初、明存沒不成。	初、明存沒不成。	004	First, clarifying the incompleteness of existence and submergence.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b05_2']	雖以能所互論存沒，究其體狀只於聖邊沒其凡感，復於凡邊沒於聖應，以其聖沒能應不得、凡沒能感不得。	雖以能所互論存沒，究其體狀只於聖邊沒其凡感，復於凡邊沒於聖應，以其聖沒能應不得、凡沒能感不得。	004	Although the existence and submergence are discussed mutually in terms of ability and object, in investigating their essence, it is only that the ordinary arousal is submerged on the sage side, and the sage response is submerged on the ordinary side. Because the sage is submerged, the able response is not obtained, and the ordinary is submerged, the able arousal is not obtained.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b05_15']	若爾，感應永殊，那言不異？	若爾，感應永殊，那言不異？	004	If so, arousal and response are forever distinct, how can it be said that they are non-different?
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b06_9']	二、「又感」下，明不異不成，大意同前。	二、「又感」下，明不異不成，大意同前。	004	Second, below Moreover, arousal, clarifying the incompleteness of non-difference, the main idea is the same as before.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b06_23']	二、「又難」下，以四性結過。	二、「又難」下，以四性結過。	004	Second, from Furthermore, it is difficult below, using the four natures to conclude the faults.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b08_2']	感能應所自屬於機，感所應能自屬於應，故是自性。	感能應所自屬於機，感所應能自屬於應，故是自性。	004	The ability to respond and the object of response belong to the capacity of the practitioner, while the object of response and the ability to respond belong to the response itself, therefore it is self-nature.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b09_1']	次之二句雖涉感應，義不相由，還屬自性。	次之二句雖涉感應，義不相由，還屬自性。	004	The next two sentences, although involving response, the meanings are not dependent on each other, and still belong to self-nature.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b09_15']	次有四句皆從彼生，故屬他性。	次有四句皆從彼生，故屬他性。	004	Next, there are four sentences that all arise from that, therefore belonging to other-nature.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b10_17']	第三不獨由自、不獨由他，須二合生，乃屬共性。	第三不獨由自、不獨由他，須二合生，乃屬共性。	004	Third, not only due to self, not only due to other, both must combine to give birth, and then belong to co-nature.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b11_6']	若離自他，屬無因性。	若離自他，屬無因性。	004	If apart from self and other, it belongs to no-cause nature.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b11_22']	二、「問若」下，明今能妙契，二：	二、「問若」下，明今能妙契，二：	004	Second, from If asked below, clarifying the present ability to wonderfully accord, in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b12_7']	初、離四句無感應以問。	初、離四句無感應以問。	004	First, using the four statements to ask about the absence of response without stimulus.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b13_2']	二、「答聖」下，用四悉立因緣而答。	二、「答聖」下，用四悉立因緣而答。	004	Second, from The sage below, using the four perspectives to establish causes and conditions to answer.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b14_1']	大聖圓證，三千理事同在一心，故心平等。	大聖圓證，三千理事同在一心，故心平等。	004	The great sage perfectly realizes that the three thousand principles and phenomena are the same in one mind, therefore the mind is equal.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b14_15']	一一皆了即空假中，故心無住。	一一皆了即空假中，故心無住。	004	Each and every one is understood to be empty, provisional, and middle, therefore the mind is without abiding.
['ZH_T34_1727_004:0920b18_1']	聖既用此平等無住為能應法，故不住著所應機感，但隨十界樂欲便宜破惡入理四機扣之，即以世界、為人、對治、第一義四種之法任運而應。	聖既用此平等無住為能應法，故不住著所應機感，但隨十界樂欲便宜破惡入理四機扣之，即以世界、為人、對治、第一義四種之法任運而應。	004	Since the sage uses this equality and non-abiding as the Dharma of responsiveness, he does not abide in or attach to the responsive capacities of beings.
