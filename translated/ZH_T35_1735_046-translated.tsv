['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a07_16']	初來意，為答第二會中十通問故，以二品明業用廣大，前定、此通，義次第故。	初來意，為答第二會中十通問故，以二品明業用廣大，前定、此通，義次第故。	First, the reason for coming is to answer the question of the ten penetrations in the second assembly. The two chapters clarify the vastness of karmic activity. The previous concentration and this penetration are in sequential order.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a08_3']	亦由依定發通。	亦由依定發通。	It is also because the penetrations are attained based on concentration.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a09_9']	二釋名者，通即神通，謂妙用難測曰神，自在無擁曰通。	二釋名者，通即神通，謂妙用難測曰神，自在無擁曰通。	Second, as for explaining the name, penetration refers to spiritual penetrations. It means that wondrous function is difficult to fathom, and it is called penetration because it is sovereign and unobstructed.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a09_19']	妙用無極，寄十顯圓。	妙用無極，寄十顯圓。	Wondrous function is ultimate, and the ten are used to manifest perfection.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a13_1']	然通與明經論皆異，故《智度論》第三云「直知過去宿命之事為通，若知過去因緣行業為明」等。	然通與明經論皆異，故《智度論》第三云「直知過去宿命之事為通，若知過去因緣行業為明」等。	However, the sutras and treatises all differ in their explanations of penetrations and illuminations. Therefore, the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom, fascicle 3, says: Directly knowing the events of one's past lives is a penetration. If one knows the causes and conditions and karmic activities of the past, it is an illumination.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a14_1']	今以此經通即委照，亦得稱明，如文廣說。	今以此經通即委照，亦得稱明，如文廣說。	Now, using this sutra to thoroughly illuminate, it can also be called illumination, as explained in detail in the text.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a14_16']	故下經云「非諸菩薩通明境界」。	故下經云「非諸菩薩通明境界」。	Therefore, the sutra below says, It is not the realm of the universal illumination of the bodhisattvas.

Other's minds, 2. Heavenly eye, 3. Knowing past eons and past abodes, 4. Exhausting future eons, 5. Unimpeded and pure heavenly ear, 6. Without substance or nature, and going to all buddha lands without movement, 7. Well discerning all words, 8. Innumerable form bodies, 9. Wisdom of all dharmas, 10. Entering the samadhi of the extinction of all dharmas.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a26_2']	此十亦是開彼六通，天眼、天耳、神足、漏盡各分二故。	此十亦是開彼六通，天眼、天耳、神足、漏盡各分二故。	These ten are also the unfolding of those six spiritual powers, because the spiritual powers of heavenly eye, heavenly ear, spiritual feet, and the destruction of contaminants are each divided into two.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a26_13']	天眼約見現未分成二四；	天眼約見現未分成二四；	The heavenly eye is divided into two based on seeing the present and future;

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850a28_16']	神足約業用及色身分成六八；	神足約業用及色身分成六八；	The spiritual feet are divided into six based on karmic function and the physical body;

Now, the ten spiritual powers of the One Vehicle have wisdom functions that are layered and all-pervasive throughout the Dharma realm, like the emperor's net, with the perfect interfusion of thought and realm. Therefore, they surpass even those [of the Three Vehicles], let alone the common spiritual powers.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b07_6']	標云他心者，智以他心為所緣故。	標云他心者，智以他心為所緣故。	The statement says the minds of others because the cognition takes the minds of others as its object.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b09_13']	然智緣他心，諸說不同。	然智緣他心，諸說不同。	However, there are different explanations about cognition taking the minds of others as its object.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b10_16']	「佛智緣他心，緣得本質，餘皆變影。	「佛智緣他心，緣得本質，餘皆變影。	The Buddha's cognition takes the minds of others as its object, taking the actual substance, while the rest all transform into images.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b12_13']	」護法論師則佛亦變影，若緣本質得心外法，壞唯識故，但極似本質，有異因人。	」護法論師則佛亦變影，若緣本質得心外法，壞唯識故，但極似本質，有異因人。	The master Dharmapāla says that the Buddha also transforms into images. If it takes the actual substance as its object, it would be a dharma outside the mind, thus destroying the doctrine of consciousness-only. It is only extremely similar to the actual substance, with a different cause.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b13_3']	依唯識宗，護法為正。	依唯識宗，護法為正。	According to the Consciousness-Only school, Dharmapāla is correct.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b14_14']	以今經望，前亦未失，以攝境從心不壞境故，能所兩亡不礙存故。	以今經望，前亦未失，以攝境從心不壞境故，能所兩亡不礙存故。	If we compare it to the present sutra, it is not yet lost, because it includes objects in the mind without destroying the objects, and because the ability to perceive and the perceived are both absent without obstructing their existence.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b15_15']	第一義唯心非一非異，正緣他時即是自故。	第一義唯心非一非異，正緣他時即是自故。	In the ultimate truth, the mind is neither one nor different. When directly perceiving others, it is precisely one's own.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b18_15']	以即佛心之眾生心非即眾生心之佛心為所緣，以即眾生心之佛心非即佛心之眾生心為能緣，如是鎔融，故非一非異。	以即佛心之眾生心非即眾生心之佛心為所緣，以即眾生心之佛心非即佛心之眾生心為能緣，如是鎔融，故非一非異。	Taking the mind of sentient beings that is identical to the Buddha's mind as the perceived object, which is not the Buddha's mind that is identical to the mind of sentient beings; taking the Buddha's mind that is identical to the mind of sentient beings as the perceiving subject, which is not the mind of sentient beings that is identical to the Buddha's mind. In this way, they are fused, so it is neither one nor different.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0850b19_16']	若離佛外別有眾生更須變影，却失真唯識義。	若離佛外別有眾生更須變影，却失真唯識義。	If, apart from the Buddha, there are sentient beings who still need to transform their perceptions, then they lose the true meaning of consciousness only.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0853b16_16']	二者諸句一一皆在無生句中，正無生時諸義頓足，以是即事之理非斷滅故、即理之智無能所故。	二者諸句一一皆在無生句中，正無生時諸義頓足，以是即事之理非斷滅故、即理之智無能所故。	Second, each of the phrases is contained within the phrase of non-arising. When there is truly no arising, all meanings are suddenly complete. This is because this is the principle of phenomena, not annihilation, and the wisdom of principle has no subject or object.

Extinction is defiled dharma. Defilement is the difference between before and after. Difference is the difference in location. Where there is existence, subject and object are not tranquil. If they are not tranquil, there is desire. If there is desire, there is activity. Activity is having something to wish for. Wishing is the mind abiding in the matter of the wish. Abiding is having going and coming.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0855c16_1']	後對雙遮真俗，即權實雙寂。	後對雙遮真俗，即權實雙寂。	The latter pair both conceals the true and conventional, which is the same as the two quiescences of skillful means and truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0855c16_17']	遮照一時為雙運，互奪無礙為自在。	遮照一時為雙運，互奪無礙為自在。	Concealing and revealing at the same time is called freely operating both, mutually negating without obstruction is called self-mastery.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0855c23_12']	若約影喻通喻一切法，則日等喻因。	若約影喻通喻一切法，則日等喻因。	If the reflection is generally compared to all dharmas, then the sun, etc. are compared to causes.

['ZH_T35_1735_046:0856a07_8']	前映質之影，雖因日等影乃隨身，不於日內而現，故喻諸識雖託境生，異自在我，非在於境。	前映質之影，雖因日等影乃隨身，不於日內而現，故喻諸識雖託境生，異自在我，非在於境。	The shadow cast by the body facing an object, although caused by the sun, etc., the shadow follows the body and does not appear within the sun, therefore it is a metaphor for the various consciousnesses, although born depending on objects, being different from the self-dependent person, and not being in the objects.

Within it, sameness and difference, combination and separation, generally reveal the meaning of reflection, each with four statements, like the analogy of an illusion.
['ZH_T35_1735_046:0856a10_16']	然一異約此影彼影，合離約影對水等。	然一異約此影彼影，合離約影對水等。	However, sameness and difference are about this reflection and that reflection, combination and separation are about the reflection facing water and so forth.
