['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c08_13']	不定謂悔眠，　　尋伺二各二。	不定謂悔眠，　　尋伺二各二。	007	Indeterminate means remorse, sleep, applied thought, sustained thought, and the two each.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c09_2']	論曰：	論曰：	007	Treatise:
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c11_2']	悔、眠、尋、伺於善染等皆不定故，非如觸等定遍心故，非如欲等定遍地故，立不定名。	悔、眠、尋、伺於善染等皆不定故，非如觸等定遍心故，非如欲等定遍地故，立不定名。	007	Remorse, sleep, applied thought, and sustained thought are all indeterminate in terms of wholesome, defiled, etc., because they are not definitely present in all minds like contact, etc., and are not definitely present in all stages like desire, etc. Therefore they are called indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c12_2']	悔謂惡作，惡所作業追悔為性，障止為業。	悔謂惡作，惡所作業追悔為性，障止為業。	007	Remorse means regret. Its nature is that of remorse for evil deeds done, and its activity is that of obstructing tranquility.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c12_11']	此即於果假立因名。	此即於果假立因名。	007	This is provisionally established as the cause based on the effect.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c13_4']	先惡所作業，後方追悔故。	先惡所作業，後方追悔故。	007	Because one first does evil deeds and only later regrets them.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c14_13']	悔先不作亦惡所攝，如追悔言我先不作如是事業，是我惡作。	悔先不作亦惡所攝，如追悔言我先不作如是事業，是我惡作。	007	Regretting not doing something in the past is also included in evil, just like remorse, as when one says, I did not do such a thing in the past. This is my evil regret.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c15_14']	眠謂睡眠，令身不自在昧略為性，障觀為業。	眠謂睡眠，令身不自在昧略為性，障觀為業。	007	Sleep is that which causes the body to be in a state of helplessness and is characterized by obscurity and contraction. Its activity is that of obstructing contemplation.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c16_15']	謂睡眠位身不自在心極闇劣，一門轉故。	謂睡眠位身不自在心極闇劣，一門轉故。	007	That is, in the state of sleep, the body is in a state of helplessness and mind is extremely obscure and weak, and evolves in a single way.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c18_16']	昧簡在定，略別寤時，令顯睡眠非無體用，有無心位假立此名，如餘蓋纏心相應故。	昧簡在定，略別寤時，令顯睡眠非無體用，有無心位假立此名，如餘蓋纏心相應故。	007	Obscurity distinguishes it from samādhi, and contraction distinguishes it from the waking state. It is necessary to show that sleep is not without substance and function. In states of mindlessness, this name is provisionally established, because it is associated with mind, like the other hindrances and bonds.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c19_17']	有義，此二唯癡為體，說隨煩惱及癡分故。	有義，此二唯癡為體，說隨煩惱及癡分故。	007	There is an interpretation that these two dharmas have only delusion as their substance, because it is said that they are derivative passions and are categorized as delusion.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c21_16']	有義，不然，亦通善故，應說此二染癡為體，淨即無癡，論依染分說隨煩惱及癡分攝。	有義，不然，亦通善故，應說此二染癡為體，淨即無癡，論依染分說隨煩惱及癡分攝。	007	Another interpretation disagrees and says that they are also good, because it is said that they are categorized as faith, conscience, etc. It should be said that these two dharmas have delusion as their substance when defiled, and when pure, they are not categorized as delusion. The treatise says that they are derivative passions and categorized as delusion from the point of view of the defiled part of these two dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c22_18']	有義，此說亦不應理，無記非癡，無癡性故。	有義，此說亦不應理，無記非癡，無癡性故。	007	Another interpretation says that the above explanation is not reasonable, because the indeterminate is not delusion, because it is the nature of nondelusion.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c23_16']	應說惡作思慧為體，明了思擇所作業故。	應說惡作思慧為體，明了思擇所作業故。	007	It should be said that remorse has thinking and discernment as its substance, because it is the activity of thinking that examines clearly.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c25_7']	睡眠合用思想為體，思想種種夢境相故，論俱說為世俗有故。	睡眠合用思想為體，思想種種夢境相故，論俱說為世俗有故。	007	Sleep is combined with thought as its essence, because thought imagines various dream images, and the treatises all say that it exists conventionally.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c26_7']	彼染污者是癡等流，如不信等說為癡分。	彼染污者是癡等流，如不信等說為癡分。	007	That which is defiled is a mode of dharmas that is delusion, just as faithlessness, etc., are said to be modes of delusion.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c27_7']	有義，彼說理亦不然，非思慧想纏彼性故。	有義，彼說理亦不然，非思慧想纏彼性故。	007	There is an interpretation that the above explanation is not reasonable, because neither thought, discernment, nor conceptualization are the natures of the entanglements.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c28_16']	應說此二各別有體，與餘心所行相別故，隨癡相說名世俗有。	應說此二各別有體，與餘心所行相別故，隨癡相說名世俗有。	007	It should be said that these two entanglements each have a separate substance, because their modes of activity differ from other mental activities. They are said to exist conventionally in accordance with the characteristic of delusion.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0035c29_16']	尋謂尋求，令心怱遽於意言境麁轉為性；	尋謂尋求，令心怱遽於意言境麁轉為性；	007	Agitation is the agitation of the mind, and its nature and activity are to cause the mind to be restless and to be gross in its functioning with regard to verbal and written expressions.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a02_15']	伺謂伺察，令心怱遽於意言境細轉為性，此二俱以安不安住身心分位所依為業。	伺謂伺察，令心怱遽於意言境細轉為性，此二俱以安不安住身心分位所依為業。	007	Reflection is the reflection on the mind, and its nature and activity are to cause the mind to be restless and to be subtle in its functioning with regard to verbal and written expressions. The function of both is to support the states of restlessness and unsteadiness of body and mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a04_7']	並用思慧一分為體，於意言境不深推度及深推度義類別故。	並用思慧一分為體，於意言境不深推度及深推度義類別故。	007	Both have as their substance a part of thought and discernment, because there is a difference in the meaning of not deeply investigating and deeply investigating verbal and written expressions.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a05_6']	若離思慧，尋伺二種體類差別不可得故。	若離思慧，尋伺二種體類差別不可得故。	007	If apart from thought and discernment, the two kinds of agitation cannot be found to have a separate substance.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a06_6']	二各二者，有義尋伺各有染淨二類差別。	二各二者，有義尋伺各有染淨二類差別。	007	As for the two each having two kinds, there is an interpretation that applied thought and sustained thought are each divided into two classes, pure and impure.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a07_5']	有義，此釋不應正理，悔眠亦有染淨二故。	有義，此釋不應正理，悔眠亦有染淨二故。	007	According to another interpretation, this explanation is not correct, because regret and applied thought are also each of two kinds, pure and impure.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a08_6']	應說如前諸染心所，有是煩惱、隨煩惱性。	應說如前諸染心所，有是煩惱、隨煩惱性。	007	It should be said that, like the previously mentioned impure mental activities, these two are of the nature of either passions or secondary passions.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a09_4']	此二各有不善無記，或復各有纏及隨眠。	此二各有不善無記，或復各有纏及隨眠。	007	These two each have unwholesome and indeterminate forms, and they are also each described as bonds and propensities.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a10_4']	有義，彼釋亦不應理，不定四後有此言故。	有義，彼釋亦不應理，不定四後有此言故。	007	According to another interpretation, this explanation is also not correct, because the words each having two kinds occur after the four indeterminate mental activities.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a10_13']	應言二者顯二種二：	應言二者顯二種二：	007	It should be said that the two each having two kinds refers to two kinds of two:
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a12_3']	一謂悔眠、二謂尋伺，此二二種種類各別，故一二言顯二二種。	一謂悔眠、二謂尋伺，此二二種種類各別，故一二言顯二二種。	007	1) regret and applied thought, and 2) sustained thought and distraction. These two kinds of two are each of a different kind, and therefore the words one and two refer to two kinds of two.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a13_3']	此各有二，謂染不染，非如善染各唯一故。	此各有二，謂染不染，非如善染各唯一故。	007	Each of these two kinds of two has two kinds, pure and impure, because, unlike the good mental activities, which are each of only one kind, and the impure mental activities, which are also each of only one kind, these two each have two kinds.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a15_5']	或唯簡染故說此言，有亦說為隨煩惱故，為顯不定義說二各二言，故置此言深為有用。	或唯簡染故說此言，有亦說為隨煩惱故，為顯不定義說二各二言，故置此言深為有用。	007	Or, the words each having two kinds are used to exclude only the impure, because they are also called secondary passions. The words each having two kinds are used to indicate the indeterminate, and therefore they are very useful.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a16_18']	四中尋伺定是假有，思慧合成，聖所說故。	四中尋伺定是假有，思慧合成，聖所說故。	007	Among the four dharmas, applied thought and sustained thought definitely exist conventionally, because they are said by the sages to be a combination of thinking and discernment.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a17_18']	悔眠有義亦是假有，《瑜伽》說為世俗有故。	悔眠有義亦是假有，《瑜伽》說為世俗有故。	007	There is an interpretation that regret and drowsiness also exist conventionally, because the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that they exist relatively.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a18_15']	有義，此二是實物有，唯後二種說假有故。	有義，此二是實物有，唯後二種說假有故。	007	According to another interpretation, these two exist as real things, because only the last two are said to exist conventionally.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a19_14']	世俗有言隨他相說，非顯前二定是假有。	世俗有言隨他相說，非顯前二定是假有。	007	The words relatively exist are said from the perspective of others, and do not indicate that the first two definitely exist conventionally.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a20_14']	又如內種體雖是實，而論亦說世俗有故。	又如內種體雖是實，而論亦說世俗有故。	007	Also, it is like the case of internal seeds, which, although real, are also said to exist relatively.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a21_14']	四中尋伺定不相應，體類是同、麁細異故。	四中尋伺定不相應，體類是同、麁細異故。	007	Among the four dharmas, applied thought and sustained thought are definitely not associated, because they are the same in substance and mode of activity, but differ as gross and fine.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a23_3']	依於尋伺有染離染立三地別，不依彼種現起有無故無雜亂。	依於尋伺有染離染立三地別，不依彼種現起有無故無雜亂。	007	The three stages of the realm of form are distinguished on the basis of the presence or absence of defiled or pure applied thought and sustained thought, not on the basis of the presence or absence of their seeds. Therefore there is no confusion.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a24_3']	俱與前二容互相應，前二亦有互相應義。	俱與前二容互相應，前二亦有互相應義。	007	The four dharmas may be associated with the first two dharmas, applied thought and sustained thought, and the first two may be associated with each other.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a24_17']	四皆不與第七八俱，義如前說。	四皆不與第七八俱，義如前說。	007	None of the four is associated with the seventh or eighth consciousnesses, as was said earlier.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a25_12']	悔眠唯與第六識俱，非五法故。	悔眠唯與第六識俱，非五法故。	007	Regret and drowsiness are associated only with the sixth consciousness, because they are not dharmas of the first five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a26_12']	有義，尋伺亦五識俱，論說五識有尋伺故。	有義，尋伺亦五識俱，論說五識有尋伺故。	007	There is an interpretation that both applied thought and sustained thought are associated with the five consciousnesses, because a treatise says that the five consciousnesses have applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a28_2']	又說尋伺即七分別，謂有相等，《雜集》復言任運分別謂五識故。	又說尋伺即七分別，謂有相等，《雜集》復言任運分別謂五識故。	007	Also, it is said that applied thought and sustained thought are the seven kinds of discrimination, such as that with signs, etc., and the Abhidharmasamuccaya-vyākhyā says that spontaneous discrimination refers to the five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036a29_9']	有義，尋伺唯意識俱，論說尋求伺察等法皆是意識不共法故。	有義，尋伺唯意識俱，論說尋求伺察等法皆是意識不共法故。	007	There is an interpretation that applied thought and sustained thought are associated only with mental consciousness, because a treatise says that such dharmas as seeking and deciding are all special attributes of mental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b01_10']	又說尋伺憂喜相應，曾不說與苦樂俱故。	又說尋伺憂喜相應，曾不說與苦樂俱故。	007	Also, it is said that applied thought and sustained thought are associated with sorrow and joy, and it is never said that they are associated with suffering and happiness.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b02_11']	捨受遍故可不待說，何緣不說與苦樂俱？	捨受遍故可不待說，何緣不說與苦樂俱？	007	Since the feeling of indifference is universal, it need not be mentioned. Why is it not said that they are associated with suffering and happiness?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b03_13']	雖初靜慮有意地樂，而不離喜，總說喜名。	雖初靜慮有意地樂，而不離喜，總說喜名。	007	Even though there is happiness in the realm of manas in the first trance state, it is not apart from joy, and therefore it is generally referred to as joy.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b04_13']	雖純苦處有意地苦，而似憂故，總說為憂。	雖純苦處有意地苦，而似憂故，總說為憂。	007	Even though there is suffering in the realm of manas in a place of unadulterated suffering, it is similar to sorrow and therefore generally referred to as sorrow.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b06_3']	又說尋伺以名身等義為所緣，非五識身以名身等義為境故。	又說尋伺以名身等義為所緣，非五識身以名身等義為境故。	007	Also, it is said that applied thought and sustained thought have as their objects the meaning of such things as names, and the five consciousnesses do not have as their objects the meaning of such things as names.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b07_7']	然說五識有尋伺者，顯多由彼起，非說彼相應。	然說五識有尋伺者，顯多由彼起，非說彼相應。	007	However, when it is said that the five consciousnesses have applied thought and sustained thought, it is said that they are manifested by them, not that they are associated with them.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b08_18']	《雜集》所言任運分別謂五識者，彼與《瑜伽》所說分別，義各有異。	《雜集》所言任運分別謂五識者，彼與《瑜伽》所說分別，義各有異。	007	The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that the five consciousnesses are spontaneous discrimination, but the meaning of discrimination in the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra is different from that in the Abhidharmasamuccaya.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b11_5']	彼說任運即是五識，《瑜伽》說此是五識俱分別意識相應尋伺，故彼所引為證不成，由此五識定無尋伺。	彼說任運即是五識，《瑜伽》說此是五識俱分別意識相應尋伺，故彼所引為證不成，由此五識定無尋伺。	007	The former says that spontaneous discrimination is the five consciousnesses, but the latter says that this is the applied thought and sustained thought associated with discriminating mental consciousness that accompanies the five consciousnesses. Therefore the evidence that the former text offers is inconclusive. Consequently, the five consciousnesses definitely do not have applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b12_4', 'ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b13_4']	有義，惡作憂捨相應，唯慼行轉，通無記故。🔽睡眠喜憂捨受俱起，行通歡慼中庸轉故。	有義，惡作憂捨相應，唯慼行轉，通無記故。 睡眠喜憂捨受俱起，行通歡慼中庸轉故。	007	There is an interpretation that remorse is associated with sorrow and indifference, because it evolves as a painful activity and is also indeterminate.🔽Drowsiness is associated with the five feelings, because its activity evolves as joy, sorrow, etc., and as a neutral feeling.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b14_3']	尋伺憂喜捨樂相應，初靜慮中意樂俱故。	尋伺憂喜捨樂相應，初靜慮中意樂俱故。	007	Applied thought and sustained thought are associated with sorrow, joy, indifference, and happiness, because in the first trance state, mental volition is associated with happiness.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b15_2']	有義，此四亦苦受俱，純苦趣中意若俱故。	有義，此四亦苦受俱，純苦趣中意若俱故。	007	According to another interpretation, these four indeterminate mental activities are also associated with the feeling of suffering, because mental volition is associated with suffering in the destinies of pure suffering.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b16_2']	四皆容與五別境俱，行相所緣不相違故。	四皆容與五別境俱，行相所緣不相違故。	007	All four may be associated with the five mental activities with specific objects, because there is no contradiction among their modes of activity and objects.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b17_2']	悔眠但與十善容俱，此唯在欲，無輕安故。	悔眠但與十善容俱，此唯在欲，無輕安故。	007	Regret and sloth are only associated with the ten good mental activities, because they exist only in the realm of desire and are devoid of serenity.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b18_2']	尋伺容與十一善俱，初靜慮中輕安俱故。	尋伺容與十一善俱，初靜慮中輕安俱故。	007	Reflection and investigation are associated with eleven good mental activities, because in the first trance state they are associated with serenity.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b19_2']	悔但容與無明相應，此行相麁，貪等細故。	悔但容與無明相應，此行相麁，貪等細故。	007	Regret is only associated with ignorance, because its mode of activity is gross and craving, etc., are subtle.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b20_1']	睡眠尋伺十煩惱俱，此彼展轉不相違故。	睡眠尋伺十煩惱俱，此彼展轉不相違故。	007	Sleepiness, reflection, and investigation are associated with the ten passions, because they are not mutually contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b21_1']	悔與中大隨惑容俱，非忿等十，各為主故。	悔與中大隨惑容俱，非忿等十，各為主故。	007	Regret is associated with the medium and large secondary passions, but not with the ten such as anger, because these are each dominant.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b22_1']	睡眠尋伺二十容俱，眠等位中皆起彼故。	睡眠尋伺二十容俱，眠等位中皆起彼故。	007	Sleepiness, reflection, and investigation are associated with the twenty secondary passions, because all occur in states of sleepiness, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b23_1']	此四皆通善等三性，於無記業亦追悔故。	此四皆通善等三性，於無記業亦追悔故。	007	These four mental activities are associated with the three moral natures of good, bad, and indeterminate, because one also regrets indeterminate actions.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b23_20', 'ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b24_17']	有義，初二唯生得善，行相麁鄙及昧略故；🔽後二亦通加行善攝，聞所成等有尋伺故。	有義，初二唯生得善，行相麁鄙及昧略故； 後二亦通加行善攝，聞所成等有尋伺故。	007	There is an interpretation that the first two are only innate good mental activities, because their modes of activity are gross and contemptible and dull and obscure, respectively.🔽The last two are also categorized as good mental activities acquired through subsequently, because reflection and investigation exist in the good mental activities acquired through hearing and though thought.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b25_17']	有義，初二亦加行善，聞思位中有悔眠故；	有義，初二亦加行善，聞思位中有悔眠故；	007	According to another interpretation, the first two are also good mental activities acquired through subsequently, because regret and sleepiness exist in the states of hearing and thought.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b26_16']	後三皆通染淨無記，惡作非染，解麁猛故。	後三皆通染淨無記，惡作非染，解麁猛故。	007	The last three are all found in the defiled, pure, and indeterminate categories. Remorse is not defiled, because its mode of activity is coarse and violent.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b27_14']	四無記中悔唯中二，行相麁猛非定果故。	四無記中悔唯中二，行相麁猛非定果故。	007	Among the four indeterminate dharmas, remorse is only the first two, because its mode of activity is coarse and violent and it is not a result of meditation.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b28_15']	眠除第四，非定引生，異熟生心亦得眠故。	眠除第四，非定引生，異熟生心亦得眠故。	007	Sleep is excluded from the fourth, because it is not attracted and generated by samādhi, and because sleep is possible among the five consciousnesses that are retribution.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0036b29_15']	尋伺除初，彼解微劣，不能尋察名等義故。	尋伺除初，彼解微劣，不能尋察名等義故。	007	Applied thought and sustained thought are excluded from the first, because their understanding is weak and they are not able to investigate names, phrases, and such.

['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c01_14', 'ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c04_4']	下品修者，現法必退，不能速疾還引現前，後生彼天不甚光淨形色廣大，定當中夭。🔽中品修者，現不必退，設退速疾還引現前，後生彼天雖甚光淨形色廣大，而不最極，雖有中夭而不決定。	下品修者，現法必退，不能速疾還引現前，後生彼天不甚光淨形色廣大，定當中夭。 中品修者，現不必退，設退速疾還引現前，後生彼天雖甚光淨形色廣大，而不最極，雖有中夭而不決定。	007	Those of inferior cultivation necessarily retrogress in the present life and are unable to quickly reattain it. Later, they are born in the heavens and are not very bright and pure, and their physical form is not vast, and they die prematurely in the heavens.🔽Those of middling cultivation do not necessarily retrogress in the present life, and even if they retrogress, they quickly reattain it. Later, they are born in the heavens and are very bright and pure, and their physical form is vast, but not to the utmost degree. Even though they die prematurely, it is not certain.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c06_4']	上品修者，現必不退，後生彼天最極光淨形色廣大，必無中夭，窮滿壽量後方殞沒。	上品修者，現必不退，後生彼天最極光淨形色廣大，必無中夭，窮滿壽量後方殞沒。	007	Those of superior cultivation necessarily do not retrogress in the present life, and later, they are born in the heavens and are to the utmost degree bright and pure, and their physical form is vast, and they necessarily do not die prematurely, but perish only after exhausting their life span.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c07_3']	此定唯屬第四靜慮，又唯是善，彼所引故。	此定唯屬第四靜慮，又唯是善，彼所引故。	007	This samādhi belongs only to the fourth trance state, and is also only good, because it is attracted by that.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c07_13']	下上地無，由前說故。	下上地無，由前說故。	007	The lower and upper stages do not have it, because of what was said previously.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c08_3']	四業通三，除順現受。	四業通三，除順現受。	007	The four actions are the three, excluding that which is to be experienced after rebirth in the next life.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c09_11']	有義，此定唯欲界起，由諸外道說力起故，人中慧解極猛利故。	有義，此定唯欲界起，由諸外道說力起故，人中慧解極猛利故。	007	There is an interpretation that this samādhi is produced only in the realm of desire, because it is produced by the power of the teaching of non-Buddhists, and because wisdom and understanding in the realm of humans is extremely sharp.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c11_1']	有義，欲界先修習已，後生色界能引現前，除無想天至究竟故。	有義，欲界先修習已，後生色界能引現前，除無想天至究竟故。	007	There is an interpretation that one who has cultivated it in the realm of desire and is then reborn in the realm of form can cause it to appear, with the exception of the heaven of non-discrimination, because one has not yet reached the ultimate stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c12_1']	此由厭想，欣彼果入，故唯有漏，非聖所起。	此由厭想，欣彼果入，故唯有漏，非聖所起。	007	This samādhi is only impure, and is not produced by the holy ones, because it is entered on the basis of a disgust for thought and a delight in the result.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c15_10']	滅盡定者，謂有無學或有學聖已伏或離無所有貪，上貪不定，由止息想作意為先，令不恒行恒行染污心心所滅，立滅盡名，令身安和故亦名定。	滅盡定者，謂有無學或有學聖已伏或離無所有貪，上貪不定，由止息想作意為先，令不恒行恒行染污心心所滅，立滅盡名，令身安和故亦名定。	007	The samādhi of cessation is that state in which, on the basis of a prior intention to stop coarse conceptualization, the holy one, whether still in training or beyond training, who has subdued or is free from the craving of the sphere of nothingness or the craving of a higher sphere, which is not fixed, causes the cessation of impure mind and mental activities that are not fixed, and is called cessation because it stops the coarse conceptualization of the two kinds of self. It is also called samādhi because it causes the body to be calm and harmonious.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c16_4']	由偏厭受想，亦名滅彼定。	由偏厭受想，亦名滅彼定。	007	It is also called the samādhi of the cessation of conceptualization and feeling because it is a one-sided disgust for conceptualization and feeling.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c16_13']	修習此定品別有三：	修習此定品別有三：	007	The cultivation of this samādhi is of three grades:
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c17_15']	下品修者，現法必退，不能速疾還引現前。	下品修者，現法必退，不能速疾還引現前。	007	those of the lowest grade will certainly retrogress in this life and will not be able to quickly reattain it.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c18_13']	中品修者，現不必退，設退速疾還引現前。	中品修者，現不必退，設退速疾還引現前。	007	Those of the middle grade will not necessarily retrogress, and if they do retrogress, they quickly reattain it.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c19_3']	上品修者，畢竟不退。	上品修者，畢竟不退。	007	Those of the highest grade will never retrogress.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c21_3']	此定初修，必依有頂遊觀無漏為加行入，次第定中最居後故，雖屬有頂而無漏攝。	此定初修，必依有頂遊觀無漏為加行入，次第定中最居後故，雖屬有頂而無漏攝。	007	When this samādhi is first cultivated, it must be entered by means of the contemplation of impurity in the summit of existence as a preliminary, because it is the last of the samādhis in the order of their arrangement. Although it belongs to the summit of existence, it is categorized as pure.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c22_3']	若修此定已得自在，餘地心後亦得現前。	若修此定已得自在，餘地心後亦得現前。	007	If one cultivates this samādhi and attains mastery over it, it can also appear subsequent to minds of other stages.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c23_3']	雖屬道諦，而是非學，非無學攝，似涅槃故。	雖屬道諦，而是非學，非無學攝，似涅槃故。	007	Although it belongs to the truth of the path, it is categorized as neither training nor post-training, because it resembles nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c24_11']	此定初起唯在人中，佛及弟子說力起故，人中慧解極猛利故。	此定初起唯在人中，佛及弟子說力起故，人中慧解極猛利故。	007	This samādhi first arises only among humans, because it arises through the power of the Buddha and his disciples, and because human beings have the most acute and sharp wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c25_10']	後上二界亦得現前，鄔陀夷經是此誠證。	後上二界亦得現前，鄔陀夷經是此誠證。	007	Later, it can also appear in the upper two realms, and the Sutra of Udāyi is the proof of this.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c26_1']	無色亦名意成天故。	無色亦名意成天故。	007	Because the formless realms are also called heavens of mental formation.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c27_11']	於藏識教未信受者，若生無色不起此定，恐無色心成斷滅故。	於藏識教未信受者，若生無色不起此定，恐無色心成斷滅故。	007	Those who have not yet believed in and accepted the teaching of the store consciousness do not arouse this samādhi when born in the formless realms, because they fear that formless minds will result in annihilation.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0037c28_12']	已信生彼亦得現前，知有藏識不斷滅故。	已信生彼亦得現前，知有藏識不斷滅故。	007	Those who have already believed in it and are born there can also manifest it, because they know that the store consciousness exists and does not annihilate.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a01_4']	要斷三界見所斷惑方起此定，異生不能伏滅有頂心心所故。	要斷三界見所斷惑方起此定，異生不能伏滅有頂心心所故。	007	One must eliminate the propensities of the three realms that are eliminated by the path of insight in order to generate this samādhi, because ordinary beings are not able to subdue and eliminate the mind and mental activities of the peak of existence.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a02_4']	此定微妙要證二空，隨應後得所引發故。	此定微妙要證二空，隨應後得所引發故。	007	This samādhi is subtle and marvelous and one must realize the two kinds of emptiness and be able to elicit it through subsequently acquired knowledge.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a03_14']	有義，下八地修所斷惑中，要全斷欲餘伏或斷，然後方能初起此定。	有義，下八地修所斷惑中，要全斷欲餘伏或斷，然後方能初起此定。	007	There is an interpretation that of the propensities eliminated during the path of cultivation of the eight stages below the peak of existence, one must eliminate all of those of the realm of desire and subdue or eliminate the others before one can first generate this samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a06_4']	欲界惑種二性繁雜障定強故，唯說不還、三乘無學及諸菩薩得此定故，彼隨所應生上八地皆得後起。	欲界惑種二性繁雜障定強故，唯說不還、三乘無學及諸菩薩得此定故，彼隨所應生上八地皆得後起。	007	The seeds of the passions of the realm of desire are of two natures and are numerous and complex, and their obstruction of samādhi is strong. It is said that only those of the class of nonreturners, post-learners of the three vehicles, and bodhisattvas acquire this samādhi, and they can subsequently generate it in the eight stages above the realm of desire, as is appropriate.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a09_3']	有義，要斷下之四地修所斷惑，餘伏或斷，然後方能初起此定，變異受俱煩惱種子障定強故，彼隨所應生上五地皆得後起。	有義，要斷下之四地修所斷惑，餘伏或斷，然後方能初起此定，變異受俱煩惱種子障定強故，彼隨所應生上五地皆得後起。	007	According to another interpretation, one must eliminate the propensities that are eliminated during the path of cultivation of the first four stages and subdue or eliminate the others before one can first generate this samādhi, because the seeds of the passions that are associated with the two feelings of suffering and indifference strongly obstruct samādhi. Those who have generated this samādhi can subsequently generate it in the five stages above the realm of desire, as is appropriate.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a10_13']	若伏下惑能起此定，後不斷退生上地者，豈生上已却斷下惑？	若伏下惑能起此定，後不斷退生上地者，豈生上已却斷下惑？	007	If one can arouse this samādhi by subduing the passions of a lower stage, and later does not abandon the antidote and is reborn in a higher stage, how can one, having been reborn in a higher stage, still eliminate the passions of a lower stage?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a11_12']	斷亦無失，如生上者斷下末那得生惑故。	斷亦無失，如生上者斷下末那得生惑故。	007	Even though one eliminates them, there is no error, just as one who is reborn in a higher stage eliminates the passions that can be eliminated by insight.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a13_5']	然不還者對治力強，正潤生位不起煩惱，但由惑種潤上地生。	然不還者對治力強，正潤生位不起煩惱，但由惑種潤上地生。	007	However, the power of the antidote of the nonreturners is strong, and they do not arouse the passions in the state of being nourished by the cause of rebirth. They are only nourished by the seeds of the passions in the rebirth in a higher stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a14_14']	雖所伏惑有退不退，而無伏下生上地義，故無生上却斷下失。	雖所伏惑有退不退，而無伏下生上地義，故無生上却斷下失。	007	Even though the passions that have been subdued may or may not be subject to retrogressing, there is no such thing as subduing the passions of a lower stage and being reborn in a higher stage. Therefore there is no error in being reborn in a higher stage and eliminating the passions of a lower stage.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a16_4']	若諸菩薩先二乘位已得滅定後迴心者，一切位中能起此定。	若諸菩薩先二乘位已得滅定後迴心者，一切位中能起此定。	007	If bodhisattvas have already attained the samādhi of cessation in the state of the two vehicles, they are able to arouse this samādhi in all states.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a19_8']	若不爾者，或有乃至七地滿心方能永伏一切煩惱，雖未永斷欲界修惑而如已斷，能起此定，論說已入遠地菩薩方能現起滅盡定故。	若不爾者，或有乃至七地滿心方能永伏一切煩惱，雖未永斷欲界修惑而如已斷，能起此定，論說已入遠地菩薩方能現起滅盡定故。	007	If this is not so, then there are those who are able to eternally subdue all passions only at the end of the seventh stage. Even though they have not yet eternally eliminated the passions of the realm of desire that are to be eliminated by the path of cultivation, they are able to arouse this samādhi as if they had eliminated them, because a treatise says that only bodhisattvas who have entered the stage of fargoing are able to manifest the samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a21_15']	有從初地即能永伏一切煩惱，如阿羅漢，彼十地中皆起此定，經說菩薩前六地中亦能現起滅盡定故。	有從初地即能永伏一切煩惱，如阿羅漢，彼十地中皆起此定，經說菩薩前六地中亦能現起滅盡定故。	007	There are those who from the first stage are able to subdue all passions forever, just as an arhat does. They produce this samādhi in the ten stages, because a scripture says that bodhisattvas in the first six stages are also able to manifest the samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a23_6']	無心睡眠與悶絕者，謂有極重睡眠悶絕，令前六識皆不現行。	無心睡眠與悶絕者，謂有極重睡眠悶絕，令前六識皆不現行。	007	The two mindless states of deep sleep and fainting are states in which the first six consciousnesses do not operate because of extremely deep sleep or fainting.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a24_8']	疲極等緣所引身位，違前六識，故名極重睡眠。	疲極等緣所引身位，違前六識，故名極重睡眠。	007	The state of the body that is brought about by conditions such as extreme fatigue is contrary to the first six consciousnesses and is therefore called extremely deep sleep.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a25_10']	此睡眠時雖無彼體，而由彼似彼，故假說彼名。	此睡眠時雖無彼體，而由彼似彼，故假說彼名。	007	Even though there is no sleep in the state of sleep, it is similar to it and therefore is metaphorically referred to by the name of that state.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a26_12']	風熱等緣所引身位亦違六識，故名極重悶絕。	風熱等緣所引身位亦違六識，故名極重悶絕。	007	The state of the body that is brought about by conditions such as wind, heat, etc., is also contrary to the six consciousnesses and is therefore called extremely deep fainting.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a27_2']	或此俱是觸處少分。	或此俱是觸處少分。	007	Or, both of these are a part of the sense base of tangibility.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a27_12']	除斯五位，意識恒起。	除斯五位，意識恒起。	007	Except for these five states, manas is always present.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a28_11']	正死生時亦無意識，何故但說五位不行？	正死生時亦無意識，何故但說五位不行？	007	Since there is no manas at the moments of death and birth, why does the verse speak only of five states in which it does not occur?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a29_6']	有義，死生及與言顯，彼說非理。	有義，死生及與言顯，彼說非理。	007	There is an interpretation that the words DEATH AND BIRTH in the verse refer to the state of fainting, but that is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038a29_11']	所以者何？	所以者何？	007	Why is it unreasonable?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b01_1']	但說六時名無心故。	但說六時名無心故。	007	Therefore it is said that the six states are devoid of mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b02_10']	謂前五位及無餘依，應說死生即悶絕攝，彼是最極悶絕位故。	謂前五位及無餘依，應說死生即悶絕攝，彼是最極悶絕位故。	007	The states of death and birth are included in the state of fainting, because they are the most extreme state of fainting.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b04_10']	說及與言顯五無雜，此顯六識斷已後時，依本識中自種還起，由此不說入無餘依。	說及與言顯五無雜，此顯六識斷已後時，依本識中自種還起，由此不說入無餘依。	007	The words AND ALSO indicate that the five states are not mixed with one another. This shows that after the six consciousnesses are interrupted, they arise again from their own seeds in the root consciousness. Consequently, it is not said that they are absent in the state of nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b06_10']	此五位中異生有四，除在滅定，聖唯後三，於中如來自在菩薩唯得存一，無睡悶故。	此五位中異生有四，除在滅定，聖唯後三，於中如來自在菩薩唯得存一，無睡悶故。	007	In these five states, ordinary beings have four states, excluding that of being in samādhi that destroys thought, while saints have only the last three. Among them, the Tathāgata and the bodhisattva who has attained mastery have only one state, because they have neither sleep nor fainting.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b09_10']	是故八識一切有情心與末那二恒俱轉，若起第六則三俱轉，餘隨緣合起一至五，則四俱轉乃至八俱，是謂略說識俱轉義。	是故八識一切有情心與末那二恒俱轉，若起第六則三俱轉，餘隨緣合起一至五，則四俱轉乃至八俱，是謂略說識俱轉義。	007	Therefore, in all sentient beings, the eighth and seventh consciousnesses always occur together. If the sixth consciousness is present, then three occur together. The others occur together as a result of conditions, one to five, and then four to eight occur together. This is the general principle of the occurrence of consciousnesses together.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b10_10']	若一有情多識俱轉，如何說彼是一有情？	若一有情多識俱轉，如何說彼是一有情？	007	If many consciousnesses occur together in one sentient being, how can it be said that there is only one sentient being?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b11_10']	若立有情依識多少，汝無心位應非有情。	若立有情依識多少，汝無心位應非有情。	007	If you maintain that sentient beings are established on the basis of the number of consciousnesses, then at the time of the absence of mind, you should not be a sentient being.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b12_8']	又他分心現在前位，如何可說自分有情？	又他分心現在前位，如何可說自分有情？	007	Also, when the mind of another part of the body is present, how can you say that you are a sentient being?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b13_18']	然立有情依命根數或異熟識，俱不違理，彼俱恒時唯有一故。	然立有情依命根數或異熟識，俱不違理，彼俱恒時唯有一故。	007	However, if you establish sentient beings on the basis of the life faculty or the consciousness that is retribution, this is not contrary to reason, because both of these are always only one.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b14_17']	一身唯一等無間緣，如何俱時有多識轉？	一身唯一等無間緣，如何俱時有多識轉？	007	How can many consciousnesses occur simultaneously in one body, since there is only one consciousness that is an immediately antecedent condition?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b15_16']	既許此一引多心所，寧不許此能引多心？	既許此一引多心所，寧不許此能引多心？	007	If you admit that this one consciousness can produce many mental activities, why not admit that it can produce many consciousnesses?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b16_7']	又誰定言此緣唯一？	又誰定言此緣唯一？	007	Also, who definitely says that this condition is only one?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b17_1']	說多識俱者，許此緣多故。	說多識俱者，許此緣多故。	007	Those who admit that many consciousnesses occur simultaneously admit that this condition is many.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b18_1']	又欲一時取多境者，多境現前寧不頓取？	又欲一時取多境者，多境現前寧不頓取？	007	Also, if one wishes to grasp many objects simultaneously, why not grasp them all at once, since the power of the combination of organs, objects, etc., is the same?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b19_1']	諸根境等和合力齊，識前後生，不應理故。	諸根境等和合力齊，識前後生，不應理故。	007	It is unreasonable to say that consciousness occurs successively.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b20_10']	又心所性雖無差別，而類別者許多俱生，寧不許心異類俱起？	又心所性雖無差別，而類別者許多俱生，寧不許心異類俱起？	007	Also, although there is no difference in the nature of mental activities, many different kinds occur simultaneously. Why not admit that consciousness also occurs simultaneously in different species?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b21_10']	又如浪像依一起多，故依一心多識俱轉。	又如浪像依一起多，故依一心多識俱轉。	007	Also, just as waves and reflections are many in dependence on one , so the many consciousnesses evolve in dependence on one mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b23_2']	又若不許意與五俱，取彼所緣應不明了，如散意識緣久滅故。	又若不許意與五俱，取彼所緣應不明了，如散意識緣久滅故。	007	Also, if you do not admit that the sixth consciousness occurs simultaneously with the first five, the object it takes as its object should be unclear, because it is the same as the distracted mental consciousness that has as its object something long past.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b24_2']	如何五俱唯一意識，於色等境取一或多？	如何五俱唯一意識，於色等境取一或多？	007	How is it that the one mental consciousness that occurs with the first five takes as its object either one or many things, such as form?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b25_2']	如眼等識各於自境取一或多，此亦何失？	如眼等識各於自境取一或多，此亦何失？	007	What is wrong with saying that it is like the visual consciousness, etc., each of which takes as its object either one or many things?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b25_11']	相見俱有種種相故。	相見俱有種種相故。	007	Because both the seen part and the seeing part have many aspects.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b26_1']	何故諸識同類不俱？	何故諸識同類不俱？	007	Why do consciousnesses of the same species not occur simultaneously?
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0038b27_1']	於自所緣若可了者，一已能了，餘無用故。	於自所緣若可了者，一已能了，餘無用故。	007	If the object is one that can be cognized, one consciousness is sufficient to cognize it, and a second is useless.

It is called that which contains all seeds because it produces the four kinds of effects, i.e., homogeneous, retribution, as a dominant condition, and as a natural outflow.

They are combined and seem to be one, and it is impossible to establish that they are separate and different, and therefore they can act as similar and immediately antecedent conditions for each other.

['ZH_T31_1585_007:0040b16_8']	即依此義應作是說，阿陀那識三界九地皆容互作等無間緣，下上死生相開等故。	即依此義應作是說，阿陀那識三界九地皆容互作等無間緣，下上死生相開等故。	007	Based on this meaning, we should say that ADANAVIJÑĀNA in the three realms and nine levels can act as similar and immediately antecedent conditions for each other, because death and birth in the lower and upper realms open and guide each other.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0040b18_8']	有漏無間有無漏生，無漏定無生有漏者，鏡智起已必無斷故，善與無記相望亦然。	有漏無間有無漏生，無漏定無生有漏者，鏡智起已必無斷故，善與無記相望亦然。	007	When the impure is immediately followed by the pure, the pure is not immediately followed by the impure, because once mirror knowledge has been generated, it is never interrupted. The same is true of the relationship between good and indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0040b18_17']	此何界後引生無漏？	此何界後引生無漏？	007	In what realm is the pure subsequently acquired?

['ZH_T31_1585_007:0040b24_7']	二乘迴趣大菩提者，定欲界後引生無漏，迴趣留身唯欲界故，彼雖必往大自在宮方得成佛，而本願力所留生身是欲界故。	二乘迴趣大菩提者，定欲界後引生無漏，迴趣留身唯欲界故，彼雖必往大自在宮方得成佛，而本願力所留生身是欲界故。	007	When adherents of the two vehicles turn toward the great bodhi, they definitely acquire the pure subsequently to that of the realm of desire, because those who turn toward the great vehicle and remain in the body are only in the realm of desire. Even though they must go to the palace of Maheśvara and become Buddhas there, the bodies in which they are born through the power of their original vows are in the realm of desire.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0040b26_14']	有義，色界亦有聲聞迴趣大乘願留身者，既與教理俱不相違，是故聲聞第八無漏色界心後亦得現前。	有義，色界亦有聲聞迴趣大乘願留身者，既與教理俱不相違，是故聲聞第八無漏色界心後亦得現前。	007	There is an interpretation that in the realm of form there are also adherents of the two vehicles who turn toward the Mahayana and vow to remain in the body. Since this is in agreement with both the teachings and reason, the eighth consciousness of the adherents of the two vehicles is subsequently acquired and appears after the mind of the realm of form.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0040b27_14']	然五淨居無迴趣者，經不說彼發大心故。	然五淨居無迴趣者，經不說彼發大心故。	007	However, the scriptures do not say that those in the five pure abode heavens turn their minds to the Mahayana, and therefore they do not return to the lower stages.
['ZH_T31_1585_007:0040b29_4']	第七轉識三界九地亦容互作等無間緣，隨第八識生處繫故。	第七轉識三界九地亦容互作等無間緣，隨第八識生處繫故。	007	The seventh evolving consciousness in the three realms and nine stages may serve as an equal and immediately antecedent condition for each other, because it is bound to the stage where the eighth consciousness is born.
