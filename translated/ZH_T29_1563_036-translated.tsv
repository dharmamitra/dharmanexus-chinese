However, one cultivates the aspects and the mindfulness of the truths.

['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952b28_11']	所作所緣俱定別故。	所作所緣俱定別故。	Because the object of activity and the object-support are both fixed and different.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c01_4']	有說此種性先未曾得故，唯苦集滅三類智時，能兼修未來現觀邊俗智。	有說此種性先未曾得故，唯苦集滅三類智時，能兼修未來現觀邊俗智。	There is an interpretation that this is because this species was not previously acquired. Therefore, when the three subsequent knowledges of suffering, the origin of suffering, and the path are present, one is able to cultivate the conventional knowledge of the path of insight in the future.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c02_4']	於一一諦現觀後邊方能兼修，故立斯號。	於一一諦現觀後邊方能兼修，故立斯號。	Because one is able to cultivate it at the end of the vision of each truth, it is given this name.

['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c05_3']	三位所修何勝何劣？	三位所修何勝何劣？	What is superior and what is inferior in the three states of cultivation?
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c06_2']	若據相續，後勝於前，因增長身起彼得故。	若據相續，後勝於前，因增長身起彼得故。	If we consider the continuity of the three states, the latter is superior to the former, because one obtains it by arousing the body that is nourished by the cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c06_12']	若就界說，上皆勝下。	若就界說，上皆勝下。	If we consider the realm, the higher is superior to the lower.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c07_6']	故前所修色界繫者，界勝身劣。	故前所修色界繫者，界勝身劣。	Therefore, the bonds of the form realm cultivated previously are superior in realm but inferior in body.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c08_1']	後位所修欲界繫者，界劣身勝。	後位所修欲界繫者，界劣身勝。	The bonds of the desire realm cultivated in the later stage are inferior in realm but superior in body.

['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c10_1']	此智唯是見道眷屬，彼修道攝，故不能修。	此智唯是見道眷屬，彼修道攝，故不能修。	This knowledge is only an associate of the path of insight. Since it is included in the path of cultivation, it cannot be cultivated.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c11_10']	此意說言，修七處善為種子故，見道得生，故見道生時說彼為眷屬。	此意說言，修七處善為種子故，見道得生，故見道生時說彼為眷屬。	This means that the cultivation of the seven good factors is the seed, and the path of insight is born from it. Therefore, when the path of insight is born, it is said that they are associates.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c13_1']	或世俗智從無始來，於三諦中曾知斷證、未曾修道，故今不修。	或世俗智從無始來，於三諦中曾知斷證、未曾修道，故今不修。	Or, mundane knowledge, from beginningless time, has known, eliminated, and realized the three truths, but has never cultivated the path. Therefore, it is not cultivated now.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c14_1']	或由今時見真道故，偽道羞避，故非所修。	或由今時見真道故，偽道羞避，故非所修。	Or, because one now sees the true path, the false path is ashamed and avoided, and therefore it is not cultivated.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c14_19']	或現觀邊方修此智，道無邊故此位不修。	或現觀邊方修此智，道無邊故此位不修。	Or, this knowledge is cultivated only at the edge of realization. Since the path is boundless, it is not cultivated in this stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c16_16']	謂三諦中依事現觀，容一行者總得其邊，必無有能遍修道者，異根性道不能修故。	謂三諦中依事現觀，容一行者總得其邊，必無有能遍修道者，異根性道不能修故。	That is, in the three truths, one who relies on the contemplation of phenomena may obtain the limit of one aspect, but there is no one who can cultivate the path everywhere, because the path of different natures cannot be cultivated.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c17_16']	於自根性雖容得修，百千分中不起一故。	於自根性雖容得修，百千分中不起一故。	Although one may be able to cultivate within one's own nature, it is like a hundred thousand parts, not arising as one.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c19_5']	雖見道位未遍斷集、未遍證滅，而於當位斷集證滅其事已周。	雖見道位未遍斷集、未遍證滅，而於當位斷集證滅其事已周。	Although in the stage of the path of insight one has not yet completely eliminated the aggregates and has not yet completely realized cessation, in the present stage the elimination of the aggregates and the realization of cessation are already complete.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c20_13']	道類智時迷道諦惑，諸對治道亦不遍修，以種性根有多品故。	道類智時迷道諦惑，諸對治道亦不遍修，以種性根有多品故。	At the time of the knowledge of the species of the path, the counteragent to the delusion that is confused about the truth of the path is also not cultivated everywhere, because the species and faculties are of many classes.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c21_5']	由此於三諦，世尊說邊聲。	由此於三諦，世尊說邊聲。	For this reason, the World Honored One spoke of the limit in the three truths.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c22_6']	如契經中說有身邊、有身集邊、有身滅邊。	如契經中說有身邊、有身集邊、有身滅邊。	As a scripture says, there is the limit of the body, there is the limit of the arising of the body, and there is the limit of the cessation of the body.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c23_4']	曾無經說有身道邊，無能修道至邊際故。	曾無經說有身道邊，無能修道至邊際故。	There has never been a scripture that says there is the limit of the path of the body, because there is no one who can cultivate the path to the limit.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c24_12']	此世俗智是不生法，於一切時無容起故，此起依身定不生故。	此世俗智是不生法，於一切時無容起故，此起依身定不生故。	This conventional knowledge is a dharma that does not arise, because it is not possible to give rise to it at any time, and because the body on which it depends definitely does not arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c26_1']	謂隨信行、隨法行身，容有為依引此智起，在見道位此無容生。	謂隨信行、隨法行身，容有為依引此智起，在見道位此無容生。	That is, the body of one who practices according to faith or according to the Dharma may be the support for the arising of this knowledge, but it is impossible for it to arise in the state of the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c26_19']	故此依身住不生法，依不生故此必不生。	故此依身住不生法，依不生故此必不生。	Therefore this body is not born and does not arise, and because the support does not arise, this knowledge certainly does not arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c27_9']	若爾，依何說有修義？	若爾，依何說有修義？	If this is so, on what basis does one speak of the meaning of cultivation?
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c27_18']	依得修故說名為修。	依得修故說名為修。	It is called cultivation because one cultivates the acquisition of this knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0952c29_15']	謂於爾時起得自在，餘緣障故體不現前，即由此因說名為得，以證彼得起自在故。	謂於爾時起得自在，餘緣障故體不現前，即由此因說名為得，以證彼得起自在故。	That is, at that time one acquires mastery over its arising, but because other conditions are lacking, its substance does not appear. It is said that one acquires it because one acquires mastery over its arising.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a01_10', 'ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a02_7']	以有諸法得即現前，如盡智等。🔽或有諸法先得後現前，如無生智等。	以有諸法得即現前，如盡智等。 或有諸法先得後現前，如無生智等。	There are dharmas that are acquired and then appear, such as the knowledge of the exhaustion of the contaminants.🔽There are dharmas that are first acquired and then appear, such as the knowledge of nonproduction.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a03_2']	或有諸法得永不現前，如此智等。	或有諸法得永不現前，如此智等。	There are dharmas that are acquired but never appear, such as this knowledge of extinction.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a03_17']	或有諸法不得而現前，如外色等。	或有諸法不得而現前，如外色等。	There are dharmas that appear without being acquired, such as external form.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a04_18']	無有情數法不得而現前，故雖不生而有修義。	無有情數法不得而現前，故雖不生而有修義。	There are no dharmas that are not living beings that appear without being acquired. Therefore, although this knowledge does not arise, there is the meaning of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a05_17']	隨於何地見道現前，能修未來自地下地？	隨於何地見道現前，能修未來自地下地？	When the path of insight is present in any stage, how many future paths of insight and conventional knowledges can it cultivate?
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a06_20']	謂此俗智七地為依，即未至、中間、四靜慮欲界。	謂此俗智七地為依，即未至、中間、四靜慮欲界。	This conventional knowledge is supported on seven stages, namely, the preliminary stage, intermediate stage, four meditations, and the realm of desire.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a08_3']	若依未至見道現前，能修未來一地見道、二地俗智。	若依未至見道現前，能修未來一地見道、二地俗智。	If the path of insight is present in the preliminary stage, it can cultivate one future path of insight and two conventional knowledges.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a09_7']	至依第四見道現前，能修未來六地見道、七地俗智。	至依第四見道現前，能修未來六地見道、七地俗智。	Up to when the path of insight is present in the fourth meditation, it can cultivate six future paths of insight and seven conventional knowledges.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a10_5']	苦集邊修四念住攝，滅邊修者唯法念住。	苦集邊修四念住攝，滅邊修者唯法念住。	When cultivated at the end of the path of insight into the truths of suffering and origination, it is included in the four foundations of mindfulness. When cultivated at the end of the path of insight into the truth of cessation, it is only the foundation of mindfulness of dharmas.

['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a13_4']	謂若苦諦現觀邊修，即以緣苦四種行相，若欲界繫緣欲界苦，色界繫者緣上苦諦。	謂若苦諦現觀邊修，即以緣苦四種行相，若欲界繫緣欲界苦，色界繫者緣上苦諦。	If one cultivates at the end of the path of insight into the truth of suffering, one takes the four aspects of the truth of suffering as object. If it is associated with the realm of desire, one takes the suffering of the realm of desire as object. If it is associated with the realm of form, one takes the suffering of the upper truths as object.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a15_2']	若於集諦現觀邊修，即以緣集四種行相，若欲界繫緣欲界集，色界繫者緣上集諦。	若於集諦現觀邊修，即以緣集四種行相，若欲界繫緣欲界集，色界繫者緣上集諦。	If one cultivates at the edge of the realization of the truth of accumulation, then one uses the four aspects of taking accumulation as objects. If it is bound to the desire realm, it takes the accumulation of the desire realm as objects. If it is bound to the form realm, it takes the accumulation of the upper realms as objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a16_19']	若於滅諦現觀邊修，即以緣滅四種行相，若欲界繫緣欲界滅，色界繫者緣上滅諦。	若於滅諦現觀邊修，即以緣滅四種行相，若欲界繫緣欲界滅，色界繫者緣上滅諦。	If one cultivates at the edge of the realization of the truth of cessation, then one uses the four aspects of taking cessation as objects. If it is bound to the desire realm, it takes the cessation of the desire realm as objects. If it is bound to the form realm, it takes the cessation of the upper realms as objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a17_17']	此世俗智唯加行得，即由見道加行得故。	此世俗智唯加行得，即由見道加行得故。	This conventional knowledge is only attained through added effort, because it is attained through the added effort of the path of seeing.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a19_7']	欲界攝者是思所成，色界攝者是修所成，非聞所成，彼微劣故。	欲界攝者是思所成，色界攝者是修所成，非聞所成，彼微劣故。	That which is included in the desire realm is accomplished through volition. That which is included in the form realm is accomplished through cultivation. It is not accomplished through hearing, because it is weak.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a20_13']	智增故立智名，若并隨行，以欲四蘊、色界五蘊為其自性。	智增故立智名，若并隨行，以欲四蘊、色界五蘊為其自性。	Because of the increase of knowledge, it is established as the name of knowledge. If it is accompanied by its associates, it takes the four aggregates of the desire realm and the five aggregates of the form realm as its intrinsic nature.

Two knowledges are presently cultivated, namely the knowledge of the path and the knowledge of the path and its aspects, which are distinguished by name but not by substance.
['ZH_T29_1563_036:0953a28_10']	未離欲者未來修六，謂法及類苦集滅道。	未離欲者未來修六，謂法及類苦集滅道。	One who has not yet abandoned desire cultivates six in the future, namely the knowledge of dharmas, the knowledge of species, the knowledge of suffering, the knowledge of the cause of suffering, the knowledge of the cessation of suffering, and the knowledge of the path.
