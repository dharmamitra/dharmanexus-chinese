['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c03_16']	一立名同異，如上別對中明二開合同異，亦如上說。	一立名同異，如上別對中明二開合同異，亦如上說。	First, the similarities and differences in names, as explained above in the section on specific correspondences. Second, the similarities and differences in opening and combining, also as explained above.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c05_7']	然上體及佛住，各攝於二，清淨、莊嚴各攝於三，則四門攝十；	然上體及佛住，各攝於二，清淨、莊嚴各攝於三，則四門攝十；	However, above, essence and buddha-abiding each include two, purity and adornment each include three, thus the four gates include ten;

['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c09_3']	一以彼攝此，謂果攝劫住有剎之果，必有劫住之時分故。	一以彼攝此，謂果攝劫住有剎之果，必有劫住之時分故。	First, taking that to include this, that is, the result includes the abiding of kalpas. The result of kalpas must have the time of abiding.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c10_6']	事業圓滿攝此轉變，菩薩神通如來作用皆轉變故。	事業圓滿攝此轉變，菩薩神通如來作用皆轉變故。	The perfect completion of activities includes this transformation, because the spiritual powers of bodhisattvas and the functions of tathāgatas are all transformations.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c11_3']	二者不用彼攝，何必定須十八圓滿？	二者不用彼攝，何必定須十八圓滿？	Second, not necessarily taking that to include this, why must there definitely be eighteen perfect completions?
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c12_8']	加於此二以成二十，數正圓滿故，如以六通為十通等。	加於此二以成二十，數正圓滿故，如以六通為十通等。	Adding these two to make twenty, the number is perfectly full, like taking the six supernormal powers to be the ten supernormal powers and so forth.

['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c16_2']	由無差別約融攝說，故令十八得圓滿名。	由無差別約融攝說，故令十八得圓滿名。	Because of non-differentiation, it is explained in terms of merging and subsuming, thus causing the eighteen to attain the name of perfection.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c17_5']	則此十四皆約隨宜，由此無差別，故名圓滿無差。	則此十四皆約隨宜，由此無差別，故名圓滿無差。	Then these fourteen are all about following what is appropriate. Because of this non-differentiation, it is called perfect non-differentiation.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c17_16']	「既同」下，躡跡生難。	「既同」下，躡跡生難。	Since they are the same and below, it raises a question based on the previous explanation.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c18_11']	上云餘十四事皆是隨宜，故稱各各。	上云餘十四事皆是隨宜，故稱各各。	Above it says the remaining fourteen matters are all according to what is appropriate, thus they are called each and every.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c19_16']	其無差別稱實而說，令餘圓滿則無差別，非各各義。	其無差別稱實而說，令餘圓滿則無差別，非各各義。	Its non-differentiation is spoken in accordance with reality, causing the rest to be perfect, thus it is non-differentiation, not the meaning of each and every.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c20_6']	何以經云各各無差？	何以經云各各無差？	Why does the sūtra say each and every is non-differentiation?
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c23_2']	今答此云「所無差別事有多種故」者，上經中明塵塵剎剎佛佛生生皆悉融攝，事事相望即云一一，各各融攝即是無差。	今答此云「所無差別事有多種故」者，上經中明塵塵剎剎佛佛生生皆悉融攝，事事相望即云一一，各各融攝即是無差。	Now, in response to this, it says because there are many kinds of things that are not different. In the previous sutra, it clarifies that every dust mote, every buddha land, every buddha, and every life are all completely fused and absorbed. When comparing things with each other, it is said that each and every one is fused and absorbed, which is precisely the absence of difference.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c24_2']	疏「若將此十對成就品」下，第二攝〈成就品〉。	疏「若將此十對成就品」下，第二攝〈成就品〉。	The commentary below If these ten are compared to the Chapter on Accomplishment is the second chapter on incorporating the Chapter on Accomplishment.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c24_16']	攝前十八，共以二品皆為能攝。	攝前十八，共以二品皆為能攝。	The previous eighteen are all incorporated by the two chapters, which are both the means of incorporation.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c25_10']	今此對前，自分能所而得互攝。	今此對前，自分能所而得互攝。	Now, this is compared to the previous, and the self-division of the means and the goal can be mutually incorporated.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c26_10']	疏恐責繁不能具出，抄須盡理一一示之。	疏恐責繁不能具出，抄須盡理一一示之。	The commentary fears that it will be too complicated and cannot be fully presented, and the notes must exhaust the principles and show them one by one.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0202c28_17']	此〈華藏品〉攝〈成就品〉者，此中趣入攝彼起具因緣及清淨二事，以趣入即三解脫門，可為剎因令剎淨故。	此〈華藏品〉攝〈成就品〉者，此中趣入攝彼起具因緣及清淨二事，以趣入即三解脫門，可為剎因令剎淨故。	As for this chapter on the Adornments of the Flower Treasury incorporating the Chapter on Accomplishment, this chapter's heading incorporates the two aspects of the causes and conditions for arising and purity in that chapter, because the heading is the three gates of liberation, which can be the cause of the buddha lands and make the lands pure.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a02_1']	此中力持攝餘三事，謂佛出、劫住及劫轉變，以力持即是廣大法喜，無佛從何得法喜耶？	此中力持攝餘三事，謂佛出、劫住及劫轉變，以力持即是廣大法喜，無佛從何得法喜耶？	Among these, the power and support includes the other three things, namely the appearance of a Buddha, the duration of a kalpa, and the transformation of a kalpa, because the power and support is precisely the vast Dharma joy. Without a Buddha, how can one obtain Dharma joy?
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a02_6']	況有佛持。	況有佛持。	Even more so when there is a Buddha's support.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a02_16']	若佛不出，但以食持。	若佛不出，但以食持。	If a Buddha does not appear, it is only sustained by food.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a03_6']	若佛出世，即有法持。	若佛出世，即有法持。	If a Buddha appears in the world, there is then the support of the Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a03_16']	若以食持，住時即少；	若以食持，住時即少；	If it is sustained by food, the duration is then short;
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a04_6']	若用法持，住劫則長。	若用法持，住劫則長。	if it is sustained by the Dharma, the duration of the kalpa is long.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a06_5']	二種力持皆通轉變，法持則染變為淨，食持則淨變為染，故《俱舍》說三災起時有二種因：	二種力持皆通轉變，法持則染變為淨，食持則淨變為染，故《俱舍》說三災起時有二種因：	Both kinds of power and support are both transformation. The support of the Dharma transforms the defiled into the pure, while the support of food transforms the pure into the defiled. Therefore, the Abhidharma-kośa says that when the three calamities arise, there are two kinds of causes:
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a07_6']	一耽著美味、二者懶墮，故以食持淨變為染。	一耽著美味、二者懶墮，故以食持淨變為染。	First, indulging in delicious flavors; second, laziness and indolence. Therefore, the support of food transforms the pure into the defiled.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a08_6']	上以此二攝於彼五，五事全同故十具矣。	上以此二攝於彼五，五事全同故十具矣。	Above, these two include the other five, because the five things are completely the same, so the ten are complete.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a10_18']	若以〈成就〉攝〈華藏〉者，上以此二門攝於彼五，則以彼五攝於此二，此餘三事謂方所、分齊并及行列，彼何攝耶？	若以〈成就〉攝〈華藏〉者，上以此二門攝於彼五，則以彼五攝於此二，此餘三事謂方所、分齊并及行列，彼何攝耶？	If the accomplishment is used to include the womb of the lotus, then the above two gates include the five in that, then the five include the two here. The remaining three matters are the location, the extent, and the arrangement. Which of those are included?
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a12_17']	即五同中依住、形狀二事所攝，以但有依住則有方所及行列故，但有形狀則有分齊。	即五同中依住、形狀二事所攝，以但有依住則有方所及行列故，但有形狀則有分齊。	They are included in the two matters of abiding on the basis and shape among the five similarities, because if there is only abiding on the basis, then there is location and arrangement, and if there is only shape, then there is extent.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a14_1']	則以彼七攝此五事，五事全同，則十亦具故。	則以彼七攝此五事，五事全同，則十亦具故。	Then the seven include the five matters. The five matters are completely the same, so the ten are also complete.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a15_14']	於二處各舉十事無所不收，巧顯多端故互隱顯，理實互出為顯十八。	於二處各舉十事無所不收，巧顯多端故互隱顯，理實互出為顯十八。	In the two places, each of the ten matters raised has nothing left out. The skillful manifestation of many aspects is why they are hidden and revealed from each other. In reality, they appear from each other to manifest the eighteen.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a16_14']	疏「又上諸文」下，第三揀定所宗，可知。	疏「又上諸文」下，第三揀定所宗，可知。	The commentary's Furthermore, the above texts below is the third distinguishing and determining the main point, which can be understood.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a18_1']	疏「此彼相入亦頌趣入」者，故上疏中釋趣入義，以為此解。	疏「此彼相入亦頌趣入」者，故上疏中釋趣入義，以為此解。	The commentary's The mutual inclusion of those also praises the entry is therefore the above commentary's explanation of the meaning of entry, which is taken as this interpretation.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a18_6']	於中有二：	於中有二：	Within this there are two parts:
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a19_3']	先略屬偈文、後「皆入而無入」下通釋。	先略屬偈文、後「皆入而無入」下通釋。	First, briefly relating to the verse text, then below all enter without entering is the general explanation.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a20_8']	二偈入無入言，唯前偈中有義通後偈，故致「皆」言。	二偈入無入言，唯前偈中有義通後偈，故致「皆」言。	The words entering without entering in the two verses only have meaning in the previous verse, so it says all.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a20_13']	總有三意：	總有三意：	There are three general meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a21_9']	初一反釋，通緣起相由及法性融通二門。	初一反釋，通緣起相由及法性融通二門。	The first is a reverse explanation, which applies to the two gates of the characteristics of dependent origination and the interpenetration of the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a22_5']	約緣起門者，凡緣起法要有三義：	約緣起門者，凡緣起法要有三義：	In terms of the gate of dependent origination, all dharmas of dependent origination must have three meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a23_6']	一諸緣各異義、二互遍相資義、三俱存無礙義。	一諸緣各異義、二互遍相資義、三俱存無礙義。	First, the meaning of the difference of various conditions; second, the meaning of mutual pervasion and assistance; third, the meaning of the unobstructed coexistence of both.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a24_2']	今云「入則壞緣起」者，反釋不入。	今云「入則壞緣起」者，反釋不入。	Now, it says entering then destroys dependent origination, which is a reverse explanation of non-entry.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a24_16']	入則失緣，則無諸緣各異之義。	入則失緣，則無諸緣各異之義。	Entering then loses conditions, and there is no meaning of the difference of various conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a25_12']	言「不入則壞性用」者，反釋入義。	言「不入則壞性用」者，反釋入義。	It says not entering then destroys the function of nature, which is a reverse explanation of the meaning of entry.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a27_4']	則不得不入，不入則不得力用交徹，故無互遍相資之義，則壞用也。	則不得不入，不入則不得力用交徹，故無互遍相資之義，則壞用也。	Then one must not not enter, and not entering then cannot achieve the mutual interpenetration of power and function, so there is no meaning of mutual pervasion and assistance, and then the function is destroyed.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a28_2']	若具入不入，則俱存無礙，成緣起門。	若具入不入，則俱存無礙，成緣起門。	If both entering and not entering are complete, then both are preserved without obstruction, forming the gate of dependent origination.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203a28_16']	言法性融通門者，即性之一字。	言法性融通門者，即性之一字。	As for the gate of the interpenetration of the nature of dharmas, it is the single character nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b03_2']	凡法性融通，要不壞相而即真性，入則壞緣起者無可相入，不入則壞性者則性不遍一切法，故由不壞相而能普遍方是法性融通義也。	凡法性融通，要不壞相而即真性，入則壞緣起者無可相入，不入則壞性者則性不遍一切法，故由不壞相而能普遍方是法性融通義也。	In general, the interpenetration of the nature of dharmas must not destroy characteristics while being the true nature. If entering, then destroying dependent origination, there is nothing to mutually enter. If not entering, then destroying the nature, the nature does not pervade all dharmas. Therefore, it is only by not destroying characteristics that one can be all-pervading, which is the meaning of the interpenetration of the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b03_21']	二「又要由不入方能入耳」者，即順釋也。	二「又要由不入方能入耳」者，即順釋也。	Second, Moreover, it is only by not entering that one can enter is the straightforward explanation.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b04_9']	亦通二門，唯就相說。	亦通二門，唯就相說。	It also penetrates both gates, only speaking of characteristics.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b05_14']	若約緣起門，要由諸緣歷然不入，方能相資遍相入耳。	若約緣起門，要由諸緣歷然不入，方能相資遍相入耳。	If in terms of the gate of dependent origination, it is only by the distinctness of various conditions not entering that one can mutually assist and completely mutually enter.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b07_13']	若約法性融通門者，要由事相歷然，方隨理融入一切法，故說若唯約理無可即入。	若約法性融通門者，要由事相歷然，方隨理融入一切法，故說若唯約理無可即入。	If in terms of the gate of the interpenetration of the nature of dharmas, it is only by the distinctness of phenomenal characteristics that one can follow the principle and merge into all dharmas. Therefore, it is said that if only in terms of principle, there is nothing to merge into.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b08_13']	三「又約體空」下，亦順明，而雙約性相。	三「又約體空」下，亦順明，而雙約性相。	Third, below Also, in terms of the empty essence, it also clarifies in accordance with, but this time both nature and characteristics are discussed.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b09_6']	上第一義，相即不入、性即能入。	上第一義，相即不入、性即能入。	In the first principle above, characteristics cannot enter, but nature can enter.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b11_13']	今此一義，獨相獨性俱不能入，要二相融方能入，故言若約體空則無來無入者，是若唯約性無可即入義。	今此一義，獨相獨性俱不能入，要二相融方能入，故言若約體空則無來無入者，是若唯約性無可即入義。	Now, in this one principle, both characteristics and nature alone cannot enter. It is necessary for the two characteristics to merge before one can enter. Therefore, it says, If in terms of the empty essence, there is no coming and no entering, which means that if only in terms of nature, there is no meaning of merging and entering.
['ZH_T36_1736_027:0203b12_17']	言「約相不壞如本無差」者，即若唯約事不能即入。	言「約相不壞如本無差」者，即若唯約事不能即入。	It says, In terms of characteristics, they are not destroyed and are originally without difference, which means that if only in terms of phenomena, they cannot merge and enter.

True suchness is one of the two aspects of the arising and ceasing true suchness in the Awakening of Faith, therefore it says within the aspect of true suchness.

When one first arouses the mind, one attains the Tathāgata's one body and innumerable bodies, which is the opening and revealing of the Dharma body. Attaining ultimate wisdom and attaining the light of all wisdom is the opening and revealing of prajñā. Not attaining anything in the dharmas is because the mind is free from false grasping and has the double flow of quiescent illumination, and thus liberation is revealed.
