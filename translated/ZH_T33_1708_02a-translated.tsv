['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0388c20_13']	彼障現起，地前漸伏，乃至十地方永斷盡。	彼障現起，地前漸伏，乃至十地方永斷盡。	02a	The obstacle is gradually subdued before the ten stages, and in the ten stages it is eternally annihilated.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0388c22_2']	八地已上，六識俱者不復現行，無漏觀心及果相續能違彼故。	八地已上，六識俱者不復現行，無漏觀心及果相續能違彼故。	02a	In the eighth stage and above, that which is associated with the first six consciousnesses does not appear, because the pure contemplation and its fruit continue in a series and oppose it.

The patience of faith in the three grounds is said to eliminate the bonds of form and afflictions in the three realms. The patience of conformity in the three grounds can eliminate the afflictions of the mind and so forth in the three realms. The ground of patience of non-arising also eliminates the habits of the mind and form in the three realms. Up to the patience of cessation, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas eliminate the habits of the mind in the three realms.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a02_17']	即此下文〈受持品〉說：	即此下文〈受持品〉說：	02a	This is explained in the following passage from the chapter on upholding the sutra:

['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a07_16']	住金剛臺者，為顯諸地勝劣差別，就障麁重說貪嗔等，非就實義。	住金剛臺者，為顯諸地勝劣差別，就障麁重說貪嗔等，非就實義。	02a	As for abiding on the vajra platform, in order to show the superior and inferior distinctions of the various grounds, greed, anger, and so forth are spoken of in terms of the coarseness of the obstructions, not in terms of the true meaning.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a08_2']	所以者何？	所以者何？	02a	Why is this?

['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a12_7']	然此所說色心煩惱，自有兩釋：	然此所說色心煩惱，自有兩釋：	02a	However, there are two interpretations regarding the afflictions of form and mind that are explained here:
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a13_12']	一云從境得名，若緣色者名色煩惱，若緣心者名心煩惱。	一云從境得名，若緣色者名色煩惱，若緣心者名心煩惱。	02a	One says that they are named according to their objects. If they take form as their object, they are called afflictions of form. If they take mind as their object, they are called afflictions of mind.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a14_14']	或可從喻得名，色心相望，色麁心細，是故麁惑。	或可從喻得名，色心相望，色麁心細，是故麁惑。	02a	Alternatively, they may be named according to their analogy. Form and mind are compared. Form is coarse and mind is subtle. Therefore, coarse afflictions
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a15_8']	名色煩惱其細惑者，名心煩惱。	名色煩惱其細惑者，名心煩惱。	02a	are called afflictions of form. The subtle afflictions are called afflictions of mind.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a16_17']	色心習者，就習氣中，若麁習氣但言色心煩惱，若微細者名色心習。	色心習者，就習氣中，若麁習氣但言色心煩惱，若微細者名色心習。	02a	As for the habits of form and mind, if the coarse habits are merely called afflictions of form and mind, if they are subtle, they are called habits of form and mind.

['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a17_9']	解云：	解云：	02a	The explanation says:
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a18_9']	舊相傳說，二障種子若麁易斷，名為正使；	舊相傳說，二障種子若麁易斷，名為正使；	02a	According to the old commentaries, the seeds of the two obstacles, if gross and easy to eliminate, are called actual passions;
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a18_19']	細而難斷，名為習氣。	細而難斷，名為習氣。	02a	if subtle and difficult to eliminate, they are called residual habits.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a22_14']	慈恩三藏依《瑜伽》等說，習氣無堪任性，亦名麁重，謂由二障種子力故，所引有漏五蘊上有無堪任性，與所依蘊非一非異，無別體性故言非異、斷不斷別故言非一。	慈恩三藏依《瑜伽》等說，習氣無堪任性，亦名麁重，謂由二障種子力故，所引有漏五蘊上有無堪任性，與所依蘊非一非異，無別體性故言非異、斷不斷別故言非一。	02a	According to the Tripiṭaka Master of the Great Tang, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra and other texts say that residual habits are the quality of unfitness, which is also called coarseness. That is, the power of the seeds of the two obstacles attracts a quality of unfitness in the five aggregates that are impure. This quality is neither the same as nor different from the aggregates that support it. It is said not to be different because it has no separate substance, and it is said not to be the same because it is eliminated or not eliminated.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a23_16']	然此麁重，無體性故，不能別得擇滅法無為。	然此麁重，無體性故，不能別得擇滅法無為。	02a	However, since this coarseness has no substance, it cannot be separately obtained as the unconditioned result of elimination, the dharma of nonproduction.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a25_10']	而斷位者，且加煩惱障中見所斷種唯有一品，所引習氣有無量品。	而斷位者，且加煩惱障中見所斷種唯有一品，所引習氣有無量品。	02a	As for the state of elimination, we may add that in the obstacle of the passions, the seeds eliminated during the path of insight are of only one class, but the residual habits attracted by those seeds are of innumerable classes.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a26_19']	若依二乘，從七方便漸斷習氣，乃至羅漢入無餘依，隨所依捨。	若依二乘，從七方便漸斷習氣，乃至羅漢入無餘依，隨所依捨。	02a	If we rely on the two vehicles, the residual habits are gradually eliminated from the seven aids to penetration until the arhat enters nirvana without remainder and abandons them according to the support.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389a28_14']	若迴心者，至菩薩見道無間道時斷見所斷種，所引習氣解脫道時方能斷盡。	若迴心者，至菩薩見道無間道時斷見所斷種，所引習氣解脫道時方能斷盡。	02a	If one turns to the Mahāyāna, when one reaches the uninterrupted path of the path of seeing of the bodhisattva, one eliminates the seeds eliminated by the path of seeing, and the perfuming that is drawn out is eliminated at the time of the path of liberation.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389b01_11']	修所斷種乃至菩薩金剛心時方能斷盡所引習氣至妙覺位解脫道中方能斷盡。	修所斷種乃至菩薩金剛心時方能斷盡所引習氣至妙覺位解脫道中方能斷盡。	02a	The seeds eliminated by cultivation are eliminated at the time of the vajra-mind of the bodhisattva, and the perfuming that is drawn out is eliminated at the stage of marvelous enlightenment in the path of liberation.

Also, the Bodhisattvabhūmi says that the seeds of the two hindrances are eliminated in three stages.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389b04_2']	如何會釋？	如何會釋？	02a	How does one interpret this?

['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389b07_1']	《本業瓔珞》上卷所說，三賢菩薩伏三界煩惱麁業道，麁相續果亦不起，麁是見道。	《本業瓔珞》上卷所說，三賢菩薩伏三界煩惱麁業道，麁相續果亦不起，麁是見道。	02a	the Benye Yilu, in the first fascicle, says that the bodhisattvas of the three ranks subdue the coarse karmic paths of the afflictions of the three realms, and the coarse characteristics and continuity of results also do not arise. The coarse is the path of seeing.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389b11_16']	喜忍伏三道業道，離忍伏人中業道，明忍伏六天業道，焰忍伏諸見業道，勝忍伏疑見業道，光忍伏心因業道，無生忍伏果業道，不動忍伏色因業道，光忍伏心因業道，寂滅忍伏心色二習業道，無垢忍伏習果道。	喜忍伏三道業道，離忍伏人中業道，明忍伏六天業道，焰忍伏諸見業道，勝忍伏疑見業道，光忍伏心因業道，無生忍伏果業道，不動忍伏色因業道，光忍伏心因業道，寂滅忍伏心色二習業道，無垢忍伏習果道。	02a	The path of joy subdues the three paths of karmic action, the path of separation subdues the karmic actions of humans, the path of illumination subdues the karmic actions of the six heavens, the path of flame subdues the karmic actions of various views, the path of victory subdues the karmic actions of doubts and views, the path of light subdues the karmic actions of mental causes, the path of non-arising subdues the karmic actions of fruits, the path of immovability subdues the karmic actions of form causes, the path of light subdues the karmic actions of mental causes, the path of cessation subdues the karmic actions of the two habits of mind and form, and the path of no-defilements subdues the karmic actions of the fruit of habits.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389b12_18']	習前已斷而果不敗亡，是故佛子三賢名為伏斷。	習前已斷而果不敗亡，是故佛子三賢名為伏斷。	02a	Habits have already been severed before, but the fruits do not perish. Therefore, the Buddha's disciples, the three sages, are called the path of subduing and severing.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0389b13_12']	喜忍已上亦伏亦斷一切煩惱。	喜忍已上亦伏亦斷一切煩惱。	02a	Above the path of joy, one also subdues and severs all afflictions.

['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0398c18_13']	一無自他者，釋上無化，既無自他，如何有化？	一無自他者，釋上無化，既無自他，如何有化？	02a	First, no self, no other explains the above no transformation. Since there is no self or other, how can there be transformation?
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0398c19_14']	二第一無二者，釋無自他，第一義中無自他二故。	二第一無二者，釋無自他，第一義中無自他二故。	02a	Second, the first has no two explains no self, no other. Because in the ultimate truth there is no duality of self and other.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0398c21_13']	三非化非不化者，釋上無二，謂化是能化、不化是所化，能所俱非，故第一義無有二也。	三非化非不化者，釋上無二，謂化是能化、不化是所化，能所俱非，故第一義無有二也。	02a	Third, neither transformed nor not transformed, explains the above non-duality. That is to say, transformation is the ability to transform, and not transformation is what is transformed. Both the ability and the object are non-existent, so the ultimate truth is non-dual.
['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0398c22_1']	四非無者，遣無。	四非無者，遣無。	02a	Fourth, not non-existent, eliminates non-existence.

['ZH_T33_1708_02a:0398c25_12']	五無相無來去者，雙遣有無，所言相者是有無相，來者有相、去者無相，今此般若雙遣有無，故言無相，無來去也。	五無相無來去者，雙遣有無，所言相者是有無相，來者有相、去者無相，今此般若雙遣有無，故言無相，無來去也。	02a	Fifth, without characteristics, without coming or going, doubly eliminates existence and non-existence. What is called characteristics is the characteristics of existence and non-existence. Coming is the characteristic of existence, and going is the characteristic of non-existence. Now, this prajñā doubly eliminates existence and non-existence, so it is said to be without characteristics, without coming or going.
