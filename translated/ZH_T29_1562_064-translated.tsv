['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692a27_17']	由法隨行名隨法行，先隨教法行於義故。	由法隨行名隨法行，先隨教法行於義故。	They are called followers of the teachings because they follow the teachings and practice according to the meaning.

['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b14_12']	謂於欲界具縛為初，至斷九品以為第十，如是乃至無所有處地地各九，為七十三。	謂於欲界具縛為初，至斷九品以為第十，如是乃至無所有處地地各九，為七十三。	That is, beginning with the fetters complete in the realm of desire, up to the tenth stage of eliminating the ninth category of passions, and so on up to the state of nothingness, each of the nine stages is one kind, making seventy-three.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b15_11']	諸後具縛即前離九，故後七地無別具縛。	諸後具縛即前離九，故後七地無別具縛。	The remaining seven stages are not stages of the ordinary person, because those who are still bound by all bonds have already been freed from the nine stages.🔽Next, based on the path of cultivation, at the time of the knowledge of the classes of the path, there are distinctions in the establishment of the various sages.

['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b20_11']	即前隨信隨法行者，至第十六道類智心，名為住果，不復名向。	即前隨信隨法行者，至第十六道類智心，名為住果，不復名向。	Those who previously followed faith and those who previously followed the Dharma, up to the sixteenth thought of the knowledge of the classes of the path, are called abiding in the fruits and are no longer called those who are progressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b22_12']	隨前三向今住三果，謂前預流向今住預流果，前一來向今住一來果，前不還向今住不還果。	隨前三向今住三果，謂前預流向今住預流果，前一來向今住一來果，前不還向今住不還果。	They abide in the three fruits according to the previous three directions. Those who previously were progressing towards the stream-enterer now abide in the fruit of the stream-enterer, those who previously were progressing towards the once-returner now abide in the fruit of the once-returner, and those who previously were progressing towards the non-returner now abide in the fruit of the non-returner.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b24_1']	阿羅漢果必無初得，異生無容離有頂故，見道無容斷修惑故。	阿羅漢果必無初得，異生無容離有頂故，見道無容斷修惑故。	The fruit of arhatship is definitely not attained for the first time, because ordinary beings are not able to be free from the peak of existence, and the path of seeing is not able to eliminate the proclivities to be eliminated by cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b25_9']	至住果位捨得二名，謂不復名隨信法行，轉得信解、見至二名。	至住果位捨得二名，謂不復名隨信法行，轉得信解、見至二名。	When one reaches the stage of abiding in the fruit, one abandons the two names and acquires the two names of faith-resolve and view-attainment.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b27_4']	此亦由根鈍利差別，諸鈍根者先名隨信行今名信解，由信增上力勝解顯故；	此亦由根鈍利差別，諸鈍根者先名隨信行今名信解，由信增上力勝解顯故；	This is also due to the distinction of dull and sharp faculties. Those of dull faculties were previously called followers of faith and are now called faith-resolve, because the power of faith is superior and resolve is manifested;
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692b28_9']	諸利根者先名隨法行今名見至，由慧增上力正見顯故。	諸利根者先名隨法行今名見至，由慧增上力正見顯故。	those of sharp faculties were previously called followers of the dharma and are now called view-attainment, because the power of wisdom is superior and right view is manifested.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c02_21']	何緣先時斷修所斷欲一至五或七八品、初定一品，廣說乃至無所有處第九品惑，至第十六道類智心，但名預流、一來、不還果，非一來、不還、阿羅漢向？	何緣先時斷修所斷欲一至五或七八品、初定一品，廣說乃至無所有處第九品惑，至第十六道類智心，但名預流、一來、不還果，非一來、不還、阿羅漢向？	Why is it that when one has previously eliminated one to five categories of the afflictions to be eliminated by cultivation in the desire realm, or the first dhyāna, up to the ninth category of afflictions in the sphere of nothingness, up to the sixteenth mind of the path of insight into the categories of the noble truths, one is only called a stream-enterer, once-returner, or non-returner, and not a once-returner, non-returner, or arhat?
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c03_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c04_0']	諸得果位中，　　未得勝果道，	諸得果位中，　　未得勝果道，	In the state of attaining the fruit, one has not yet attained the path to the superior fruit,
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c05_13']	故未起勝道，　　名住果非向。	故未起勝道，　　名住果非向。	Therefore, before the superior path is activated, one is called abiding in the fruit, not a candidate for the superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c06_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c09_9']	依得聖道建立八聖，如先已說，故得果時於勝果道必定未得，以得果心於勝果道所對治惑非對治故，非非彼治現在前時得彼治道，如先已說。	依得聖道建立八聖，如先已說，故得果時於勝果道必定未得，以得果心於勝果道所對治惑非對治故，非非彼治現在前時得彼治道，如先已說。	The eight saints are established on the basis of the attainment of the path of the noble one, as explained above. Therefore, at the time of attaining the fruit, one definitely does not yet attain the path of the superior fruit. Because the mind that attains the fruit is not the antidote to the passions that are to be countered by the path of the superior fruit. When the non-antidotes to that are present, one does not attain the path of the antidote to that, as explained above.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c11_2']	又非得果時即有勝果道，所斷煩惱離繫得生，道類忍不能斷彼繫得故。	又非得果時即有勝果道，所斷煩惱離繫得生，道類忍不能斷彼繫得故。	Moreover, at the time of attaining the fruit, the disjunction-acquisition of the passions that are to be eliminated by the path of the superior fruit does not arise. This is because the receptivity to the knowledge of the doctrine with regard to the path cannot eliminate the acquisition of those bonds.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c12_10']	若道力能斷彼繫得，此道引彼離繫得生，可說此道能證彼滅。	若道力能斷彼繫得，此道引彼離繫得生，可說此道能證彼滅。	If the power of the path can eliminate the acquisition of those bonds, and if this path induces the arising of the disjunction-acquisition, then it can be said that this path can realize the cessation of those bonds.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c14_18']	以得前果時未得勝果道，故住果者乃至未起勝果道時，雖先已斷修所斷惑欲一品等，但名住果不名後向。	以得前果時未得勝果道，故住果者乃至未起勝果道時，雖先已斷修所斷惑欲一品等，但名住果不名後向。	Because at the time of attaining the previous fruit, one has not yet attained the path of the superior fruit, therefore, one who abides in the fruit, even though one has already eliminated the passions to be eliminated in the path of cultivation, such as the first stage of desire, is only called one who abides in the fruit and not one who is progressing toward the superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c15_16']	後於何時得先所斷修惑離繫無漏得耶？	後於何時得先所斷修惑離繫無漏得耶？	At what time does one attain the pure acquisition of disjunction from the passions to be eliminated in the path of cultivation that were previously eliminated?
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c16_7']	於勝果道現前時得。	於勝果道現前時得。	One attains it at the time when the path of the superior fruit is present.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c17_15']	為諸先斷彼修斷惑，入離生位得前果已，此生定起勝果道耶？	為諸先斷彼修斷惑，入離生位得前果已，此生定起勝果道耶？	Do those who have previously severed the bonds of the realm of form and formless realm and entered the stage of non-production, having attained the previous fruit, definitely produce the path of the superior fruit in this life?
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c18_6']	理必應然，以本論說：	理必應然，以本論說：	Reason dictates that this must be so, because the Abhidharma-śāstra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c19_4']	聖生第四靜慮以上，無漏樂根定成就故。	聖生第四靜慮以上，無漏樂根定成就故。	The noble ones who are born in the fourth meditation and above definitely accomplish the pure faculty of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c21_12']	若不然者，諸先已離三靜慮染，後依下地得入離生，彼得果已若生第四靜慮以上，如何可說定成樂根？	若不然者，諸先已離三靜慮染，後依下地得入離生，彼得果已若生第四靜慮以上，如何可說定成樂根？	If it were not so, those who have already severed the bonds of the three meditations and later, relying on a lower stage, enter the stage of non-production, having attained the fruit, if they are born in the fourth meditation and above, how could it be said that they definitely accomplish the faculty of pleasure?
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c24_8']	理不應言唯如是類此生必定起勝果道，非餘先斷諸下地惑，決定因緣不可得故，彼障已斷必欣彼故，障已斷道易現前故。	理不應言唯如是類此生必定起勝果道，非餘先斷諸下地惑，決定因緣不可得故，彼障已斷必欣彼故，障已斷道易現前故。	It is not reasonable to say that only this kind of person definitely produces the path of the superior fruit in this life, not others. The definitive reasons for having previously severed the bonds of the lower stages cannot be found. Because the bonds have already been severed, one necessarily delights in them. Because the path of severing the bonds is easily manifested.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c26_14']	如是已依先具倍離及全離欲入見諦者十六心位立眾聖別，當約修惑辯漸次生能對治道分位差別。	如是已依先具倍離及全離欲入見諦者十六心位立眾聖別，當約修惑辯漸次生能對治道分位差別。	Thus, in the sixteen moments of the path of seeing, those who have already completely or partially abandoned the desires of the realm of desire are established as the various holy beings. Now, in terms of the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm, we will discuss the gradual arising of the counteracting paths and their stages of distinction.

['ZH_T29_1562_064:0692c27_13']	地地失德九，　　下中上各三。	地地失德九，　　下中上各三。	In each stage, there are nine faults and virtues, each divided into three levels: lower, middle, and upper.

['ZH_T29_1562_064:0693a01_17']	欲修斷惑九品差別，上四靜慮及四無色應知亦然，生死無非九地攝故。	欲修斷惑九品差別，上四靜慮及四無色應知亦然，生死無非九地攝故。	The afflictions to be eliminated by cultivation are divided into nine grades. It should be known that the four meditations and four formless [concentrations] are also like this, because birth and death are not categorized in the nine stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0693a03_6']	如所治障一一地中各有九品，諸能治道無間解脫九品亦然。	如所治障一一地中各有九品，諸能治道無間解脫九品亦然。	Just as the obstacles to be eliminated are divided into nine grades in each stage, the counteracting paths, the uninterrupted paths and the liberated paths, are also like this in nine grades.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0693a03_15']	失德如何各分九品？	失德如何各分九品？	How are the faults and virtues each divided into nine grades?
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0693a06_9']	謂根本品有下中上，此三各分下中上別，由此失德各分九品，謂下下、下中、下上、中下、中中、中上、上下、上中、上上品。	謂根本品有下中上，此三各分下中上別，由此失德各分九品，謂下下、下中、下上、中下、中中、中上、上下、上中、上上品。	That is, the fundamental stage has three grades, weak, medium, and strong, and each of these is divided into three, weak-weak, weak-medium, and weak-strong, medium-weak, medium-medium, and medium-strong, strong-weak, strong-medium, and strong-strong. Thus there are nine grades of error and virtue.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0693a09_12']	應知此中下下品道勢力能斷上上品障，如是乃至上上品道勢力能斷下下品障，上上品等諸能治德初未有故，此德有時上上品等失已無故。	應知此中下下品道勢力能斷上上品障，如是乃至上上品道勢力能斷下下品障，上上品等諸能治德初未有故，此德有時上上品等失已無故。	You must understand that the weak-weak path has the power to eliminate the strong-strong obstacle, and so on, up to the strong-strong path, which has the power to eliminate the weak-weak obstacle. Because the strong-strong virtues, etc., that are antidotes do not exist at the beginning, and because at the time these virtues exist, the strong-strong errors, etc., do not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0693a10_12']	應知此中智雖勝惑，未增盛故道名下品。	應知此中智雖勝惑，未增盛故道名下品。	You must understand that in this case, even though knowledge is superior to delusion, it is not yet strong, and therefore the path is called weak.
['ZH_T29_1562_064:0693a11_11']	相續中惑雖極難斷，細隨行故障名下品。	相續中惑雖極難斷，細隨行故障名下品。	Even though the delusion in a continuum is extremely difficult to eliminate, because it is subtle and follows along, the obstacle is called weak.

Therefore that scripture says, “It is like one who ascends upward, and who, on the edge of the road or on the edge of the water, etc., has no support and immediately perishes.” This shows that those saints, having passed beyond that place, have no place of rebirth and therefore enter parinirvāṇa.

Therefore, the principle of eliminating the passions by categories is established. This has also been shown in the chapter on the latent propensities.

['ZH_T29_1562_064:0696a22_10']	又與見修所斷同故，謂彼宗許斷煩惱時亦有分為品別斷義，以見修道所斷諸惑許入聖時前後斷故。	又與見修所斷同故，謂彼宗許斷煩惱時亦有分為品別斷義，以見修道所斷諸惑許入聖時前後斷故。	Also, because they are the same as those eliminated by insight and cultivation. That is, that school admits that when one eliminates passions, there is also the meaning of elimination by distinguishing classes, because it is admitted that the various passions eliminated by the paths of insight and cultivation are eliminated before and after one enters the holy paths.
