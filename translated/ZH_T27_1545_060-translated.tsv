['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a12_12']	答依契經故。	答依契經故。	Answer: Because it is based on the sutras.
['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a13_6']	謂契經說三事合故得入母胎。	謂契經說三事合故得入母胎。	Namely, the sutras say that one enters the mother's womb due to the combination of three factors:
['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a13_15']	一者父母交愛和合。	一者父母交愛和合。	First, the parents have sexual intercourse out of love and harmony.

['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a16_3']	由此故知唯愛與恚令有相續。	由此故知唯愛與恚令有相續。	For this reason, we know that only love and hatred cause the continuity of existence.
['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a17_5']	為遮彼意顯一切煩惱皆令有相續故作斯論。	為遮彼意顯一切煩惱皆令有相續故作斯論。	In order to refute this view and show that all afflictions can cause continuity, this treatise is composed.
['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a18_1']	問云何通彼所引契經答契經說。	問云何通彼所引契經答契經說。	Question: How do you reconcile this with the sutra quoted by them? Answer: The sutra says:
['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a18_15']	彼中有位心正結生時非唯愛恚。	彼中有位心正結生時非唯愛恚。	When the mind of one in the intermediate state is just about to be reborn, it is not only craving and hatred.
['ZH_T27_1545_060:0309a19_5']	故我所說不違彼經。	故我所說不違彼經。	Therefore what I say does not contradict that sutra.
