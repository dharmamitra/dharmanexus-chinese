['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104a25_6']	今此品者，亦為遮空所對治，令解諸行我我所空故說。	今此品者，亦為遮空所對治，令解諸行我我所空故說。	Now, this chapter is also to refute the counteragents of emptiness, in order to make one understand that all conditioned phenomena are empty of self and what belongs to self.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104a27_12']	諸外道等雖說我見有無量種，亦以五受陰為所緣，是故今當次觀諸陰。	諸外道等雖說我見有無量種，亦以五受陰為所緣，是故今當次觀諸陰。	Although the non-Buddhists speak of the view of self in innumerable ways, they still take the five aggregates as their object. Therefore, we should now contemplate the aggregates in sequence.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104a29_1']	如佛所說，若有沙門婆羅門等言見我者，但見五陰，實無有我。	如佛所說，若有沙門婆羅門等言見我者，但見五陰，實無有我。	As the Buddha said, if there are śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, etc. who say they see the self, they only see the five aggregates, there is no real self.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104a29_11']	有異僧佉人作是說言：	有異僧佉人作是說言：	There are some Sāṃkhyas who say:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b01_13']	身相形色及四大聚、諸根諸根聚、諸識等為我。	身相形色及四大聚、諸根諸根聚、諸識等為我。	The body's shape and color, the aggregation of the four elements, the various faculties and faculties in groups, and the various consciousnesses, etc. are the self.

['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b03_1']	汝於四大諸根陰相若總若別起我分別者，是事不然。	汝於四大諸根陰相若總若別起我分別者，是事不然。	If you give rise to the discrimination of self with regard to the characteristics of the four great elements and the aggregates of faculties, either collectively or individually, this is not so.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b03_6']	如論偈說：	如論偈說：	As the treatise verse says:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b04_14']	「若我是陰相，　　即是起盡法；	「若我是陰相，　　即是起盡法；	If the self is characterized by the aggregates, it would be a dharma subject to arising and ceasing;
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b05_13']	我若異諸陰，　　是則非陰相。	我若異諸陰，　　是則非陰相。	If the self is different from the aggregates, it would not be characterized by the aggregates.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b06_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The commentary explains:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b07_3']	我者是世諦義，起於言說稱云我者，以陰為境。	我者是世諦義，起於言說稱云我者，以陰為境。	The self is a conventional truth, and the arising of speech and the designation of the self takes the aggregates as its object.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b07_9']	僧佉人復言：	僧佉人復言：	The Sāṃkhya person further says:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b08_7']	隨有陰處，我義得成，即是我所立義得成。	隨有陰處，我義得成，即是我所立義得成。	Wherever there are aggregates, the meaning of the self is established, and then my established meaning is established.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b08_11']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b09_2']	如汝意者，我是諸陰。	如汝意者，我是諸陰。	According to your intention, the self is the aggregates.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b09_12']	若我是陰，即起盡法。	若我是陰，即起盡法。	If the self is the aggregates, then it is a dharma subject to arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b11_9']	此中說驗，第一義中四大及造色聚、諸根諸根聚、諸識及識身等非我，是起盡法故。	此中說驗，第一義中四大及造色聚、諸根諸根聚、諸識及識身等非我，是起盡法故。	Here, a logical argument is presented: in the ultimate truth, the aggregates of the great elements and derivative form, the faculties and the aggregates of faculties, the consciousnesses and the aggregate of consciousness, etc. are not the self, because they are dharmas subject to arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b12_12']	譬如外四大等，果故因故、可識境界故、亦果報故。	譬如外四大等，果故因故、可識境界故、亦果報故。	It is like the external four great elements and so on, because they are effects, because they are causes, because they are objects of cognition, and also because they are karmic retributions.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b13_1']	以是等因，廣為作驗。	以是等因，廣為作驗。	For these and other reasons, extensive verification is done.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b13_8']	有自部論師言：	有自部論師言：	There are some masters of our own school who say:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b14_8']	我若是陰，一一身中有多陰故，亦有多我。	我若是陰，一一身中有多陰故，亦有多我。	If the self is the aggregates, then in each body there would be many aggregates, and therefore there would also be many selves.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b16_3']	復次我若是陰，即起盡法，以彼諸陰起盡法故，即自破汝無起無盡差別我也。	復次我若是陰，即起盡法，以彼諸陰起盡法故，即自破汝無起無盡差別我也。	Moreover, if the self were the aggregates, then it would have the characteristics of arising and ceasing, because those aggregates have the characteristics of arising and ceasing, and this would contradict your view that the self has no arising and no ceasing and is distinct.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b16_16']	差別法體破故，汝立義有過。	差別法體破故，汝立義有過。	Because the nature of distinct phenomena is refuted, there is a fault in your proposed thesis.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b17_8']	復次我若是陰，即起盡法。	復次我若是陰，即起盡法。	Moreover, if the self were the aggregates, then it would have the characteristics of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b19_1']	然外人不欲令我是起盡故，其所計我無起無盡者，亦復不能令我信解。	然外人不欲令我是起盡故，其所計我無起無盡者，亦復不能令我信解。	However, the non-Buddhists do not want the self to have arising and ceasing, so even if they claim that the self has no arising and no ceasing, they still cannot make me believe it.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b19_18']	以是故我今說驗，第一義中畢竟無我。	以是故我今說驗，第一義中畢竟無我。	For this reason, I now state the verification: in the ultimate truth, there definitely is no self.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b20_2']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b20_14']	無起無盡法故，譬如兔角。	無起無盡法故，譬如兔角。	Because it has no characteristics of arising and ceasing, like the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b21_7']	復次我者若是陰，即起盡法。	復次我者若是陰，即起盡法。	Furthermore, if the self were the aggregates, it would have the characteristics of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b22_8']	以是故我今說驗，第一義中色等五陰決定非我。	以是故我今說驗，第一義中色等五陰決定非我。	Therefore, I now present a logical argument: in the ultimate truth, form and the other four aggregates are definitely not the self.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b22_12']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b23_1']	起盡法故，譬如瓶。	起盡法故，譬如瓶。	Because they have the characteristics of arising and ceasing, like a pot.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b24_19']	如是陰者果故因故、暫有故、憂喜因故、邪智正智疑智因故非我，是諸因義，廣如前驗。	如是陰者果故因故、暫有故、憂喜因故、邪智正智疑智因故非我，是諸因義，廣如前驗。	In this way, the aggregates are not the self because they are effects, because they are causes, because they are temporary, because they are the causes of sorrow and joy, and because they are the causes of mistaken knowledge, correct knowledge, and doubting knowledge. The meanings of these reasons are as extensively examined above.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b25_15']	釋即陰已，我異陰者，鞞世師人言：	釋即陰已，我異陰者，鞞世師人言：	The Vātsīputrīyas say:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b27_16']	身及諸根覺等之外而別有我，能與苦樂等作依止，是作者、是無心、是常是遍，作如是說。	身及諸根覺等之外而別有我，能與苦樂等作依止，是作者、是無心、是常是遍，作如是說。	The self is different from the aggregates. It is separate from the body and the faculties, and from such things as cognition. It can serve as the support for suffering, happiness, and so forth. It is the agent, is without mind, is permanent, and is all-pervading. This is what they say.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b28_2']	復有僧佉人言：	復有僧佉人言：	Furthermore, the Sāṃkhyas say:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b28_7']	有如是我。	有如是我。	There is such a self.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104b28_12']	云何有耶？	云何有耶？	How is it?
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c01_2']	因果之外別有於我，然非作者，是受食者，是淨是遍，無聽聞等具。	因果之外別有於我，然非作者，是受食者，是淨是遍，無聽聞等具。	The self is separate from causes and effects. However, it is not the agent, but the one who experiences. It is pure, all-pervading, and lacks such faculties as hearing.

['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c02_8']	如彼所說，立驗方便，我無此過。	如彼所說，立驗方便，我無此過。	As you have stated, the method of establishing a logical argument, we have no fault in this.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c03_4']	復有以丈夫為因者，亦言無如上過。	復有以丈夫為因者，亦言無如上過。	There are also those who take the puruṣa as the cause, who also say there is no fault as above.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c04_12']	以是義故，鞞世師等言，諸陰外別有我者，亦復不能令物信解。	以是義故，鞞世師等言，諸陰外別有我者，亦復不能令物信解。	For this reason, the Vaiśeṣika and others say that apart from the aggregates there is a self, but they are also unable to make others understand and believe.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c05_2']	論者知故，說偈答云：	論者知故，說偈答云：	The proponent, knowing this, responds in verse, saying:
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c05_16']	我異諸陰則非陰相，非者言無。	我異諸陰則非陰相，非者言無。	The self that is different from the aggregates does not have the characteristics of the aggregates. Does not means does not have.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c06_11']	非陰相者，陰無我故，言無陰相。	非陰相者，陰無我故，言無陰相。	Does not have the characteristics of the aggregates means the aggregates do not have the characteristics of the self, so it is said to not have the characteristics of the aggregates.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c07_19']	今當說驗，第一義中色陰等外無別有我，無陰相故，譬如石女兒。	今當說驗，第一義中色陰等外無別有我，無陰相故，譬如石女兒。	Now we will state the logical argument: In the ultimate truth, apart from the form aggregate and so forth, there is no separate self, because it does not have the characteristics of the aggregates, just like the child of a barren woman.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c08_5']	鞞世師人言：	鞞世師人言：	The Vaiśeṣika person says:

['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c11_9']	」此言無為，涅槃等並已遮故，一向是無。	」此言無為，涅槃等並已遮故，一向是無。	This refers to the unconditioned, such as nirvana, which has already been refuted, so it is entirely non-existent.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c12_10']	然常遍我非苦樂等依止，有起故，譬如色等。	然常遍我非苦樂等依止，有起故，譬如色等。	However, a permanent and all-pervading self is not the basis of suffering, pleasure, etc., because it has arising, like form, etc.
['ZH_T30_1566_011:0104c12_20']	汝所立我，亦非是遍。	汝所立我，亦非是遍。	The self you posit is also not all-pervading.
