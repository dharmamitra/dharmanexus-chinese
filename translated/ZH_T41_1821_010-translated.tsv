['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a17_7']	所以婆沙．正理說無記分別唯自地能起不能起餘地　今言無覆無記近行通起上．下。	所以婆沙．正理說無記分別唯自地能起不能起餘地　今言無覆無記近行通起上．下。	010	Therefore, the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra and the Nyāyānusāra-śāstra say that indeterminate discrimination can only arise in one's own stage and cannot arise in other stages. Now it is said that the indeterminate proximate factors of clinging can arise above and below.
