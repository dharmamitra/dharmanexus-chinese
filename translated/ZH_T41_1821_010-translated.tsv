['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a05_18']	何故婆沙解三分別中云。	何故婆沙解三分別中云。	why does the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra explain the three distinctions and say:
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a06_16']	無覆無記分別意識唯生自地容現在前。	無覆無記分別意識唯生自地容現在前。	The indeterminate, unrestrained discrimination of mental consciousness only gives rise to the same stage and allows the present to appear.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a07_7']	由此必定繫屬生故。	由此必定繫屬生故。	Because this is definitely bound to birth.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a07_14']	又正理第八云。	又正理第八云。	Also, the eighth chapter of the Nyāyānusāra says:
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a08_13']	非生餘地能起餘地無覆無記分別現前。	非生餘地能起餘地無覆無記分別現前。	One who is born in other stages cannot give rise to the unrestrained, indeterminate discrimination of other stages and allow it to appear.🔽This is also because it is definitely bound to birth.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a09_9']	此亦必定繫屬生故　解云婆沙。	此亦必定繫屬生故　解云婆沙。	The explanation says: The meaning of the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a10_9']	正理意說五識引起意識地中三種分別。	正理意說五識引起意識地中三種分別。	and the Nyāyānusāra is that the five consciousnesses give rise to the three kinds of discrimination in the mind consciousness.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a11_4']	緣前過去五識所緣色等五境。	緣前過去五識所緣色等五境。	They take the five objects such as form, etc. that were previously perceived by the five consciousnesses as objects.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a11_16']	夫生餘地起餘地無覆無記。	夫生餘地起餘地無覆無記。	When one is born in other stages and gives rise to the unrestrained, indeterminate mind of other stages,
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a12_13']	所謂變化心．三識身．及發業心。	所謂變化心．三識身．及發業心。	Namely, the mind of transformation, the three kinds of consciousness, and the mind that generates karma.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a13_2']	若化心唯緣現事。	若化心唯緣現事。	If the mind of transformation only takes present things as objects,
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a13_10']	若三識性非分別。	若三識性非分別。	if the three kinds of consciousness are not discrimination by nature,
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a14_5']	又唯緣現若發業心緣所發業。	又唯緣現若發業心緣所發業。	and if the mind that generates karma takes the karma it generates as its object,
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a15_5']	此等非是緣過去五識曾所緣境分別意識。	此等非是緣過去五識曾所緣境分別意識。	these are not the discriminating mental consciousness that takes as its object the five sense objects that were once perceived in the past.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a17_7']	所以婆沙．正理說無記分別唯自地能起不能起餘地　今言無覆無記近行通起上．下。	所以婆沙．正理說無記分別唯自地能起不能起餘地　今言無覆無記近行通起上．下。	Therefore, the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra and the Nyāyānusāra-śāstra say that indeterminate discrimination can only arise in one's own stage and cannot arise in other stages. Now it is said that the indeterminate proximate factors of clinging can arise above and below.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a18_3']	據意識中所有無覆無記諸近行說。	據意識中所有無覆無記諸近行說。	This is said based on the indeterminate proximate factors of clinging that exist in the mental consciousness.🔽Therefore, there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a18_14']	故不相違　問若依正理。	故不相違　問若依正理。	If we rely on the Nyāyānusāra-śāstra,
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a19_9']	又說近行欲界緣不繫境有三。	又說近行欲界緣不繫境有三。	it also says that in the desire realm, there are three kinds of proximate factors of clinging that take unconditioned dharmas as objects.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a20_12']	色界中初．二緣不繫有二．三．四緣不繫有一。	色界中初．二緣不繫有二．三．四緣不繫有一。	In the first two stages of the form realm, there are two kinds of proximate factors of clinging that take unconditioned dharmas as objects. In the third and fourth stages, there is one kind of proximate factor of clinging that takes unconditioned dharmas as objects.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a21_2']	無色緣不繫亦一。	無色緣不繫亦一。	In the formless realm, there is also one kind of proximate factor of clinging that takes unconditioned dharmas as objects.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a21_18']	此論何故不說　解云此論且據緣繫。	此論何故不說　解云此論且據緣繫。	Why does this treatise not discuss this? It is explained that this treatise only discusses that which takes conditioned dharmas as objects.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a22_6']	所以不言不繫。	所以不言不繫。	Therefore, it does not say it is not bound.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a22_15']	正理兼論故說二種。	正理兼論故說二種。	The correct principle is discussed together, therefore it speaks of two kinds.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0179a23_9']	此意近行通無漏耶者。	此意近行通無漏耶者。	Do these mental activities of intention only extend to the uncontaminated?

The four sentences are: The first sentence is: having already abandoned the bonds of arising, but not yet abandoned the bonds of birth.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c19_17']	謂離欲．色二界貪諸無色上流者。	謂離欲．色二界貪諸無色上流者。	This refers to those who are free from the craving of the two realms of desire and form, and are upper-streamers in the formless realm.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c20_12']	離二界貪不受中有故起結已斷。	離二界貪不受中有故起結已斷。	Because those who are free from the craving of the two realms do not accept the intermediate existence, the bonds of arising have already been abandoned.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c21_12']	未斷無色貪更受無色生有故生結未斷。	未斷無色貪更受無色生有故生結未斷。	Because they will again accept the existence of birth in the formless realm, the bonds of birth have not yet been abandoned.

['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c23_16']	謂欲．色界生結得行。	謂欲．色界生結得行。	That is, bonds to be produced in the desire and form realms are obtained through activity.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c24_7']	必亦兼得行於起結。	必亦兼得行於起結。	One necessarily also obtains the activity of bonds to be produced.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c24_16']	若無色界生結現行。	若無色界生結現行。	If bonds to be produced in the formless realm are presently active,

['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c27_9']	謂中般涅槃不受生有故生結已斷。	謂中般涅槃不受生有故生結已斷。	That is, those who attain parinirvāṇa in the intermediate state do not receive a rebirth existence, so bonds to be produced are already eliminated.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c28_1']	受中有故起結未斷。	受中有故起結未斷。	But because they receive an intermediate state existence, bonds to be produced have not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c28_10']	此中言斷據不現行。	此中言斷據不現行。	Here, the word eliminated refers to non-manifestation.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c29_1']	以無生結得永治。	以無生結得永治。	Because those who have eliminated bonds to be produced have permanently eliminated them.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0181c29_10']	而於起結未斷之理。	而於起結未斷之理。	But as for bonds to be produced, they have not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a01_1']	謂斷生結即離三界。	謂斷生結即離三界。	That is, eliminating bonds to be produced is precisely detaching from the three realms.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a01_10']	而彼必無餘起結故。	而彼必無餘起結故。	But they necessarily have no remaining bonds to be produced.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a02_13']	故知此但約永不行　第三句已斷起結已斷生結。	故知此但約永不行　第三句已斷起結已斷生結。	Therefore we know that this is only in terms of permanent non-manifestation. The third case is that of those who have already eliminated bonds to be produced and have already eliminated bonds to be produced.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a03_15']	謂阿羅漢．斷三界貪不受中有故起結已斷。	謂阿羅漢．斷三界貪不受中有故起結已斷。	That is, arhats, because they have eliminated craving for the three realms and do not receive an intermediate state existence, bonds to be produced have already been eliminated.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a04_7']	不受生有故生結已斷。	不受生有故生結已斷。	Because they do not undergo rebirth, the fetters of rebirth are already severed.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a04_16']	此中言斷據永治說。	此中言斷據永治說。	Here, the word “sever” is said with reference to permanent elimination.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a05_9']	雖有於此身定成無學者。	雖有於此身定成無學者。	Even though there are those who definitely become post-learners in this body,
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a06_6']	約不現行生．起二結亦名為斷。	約不現行生．起二結亦名為斷。	they are also said to have severed the two fetters of arising and rebirth with reference to their non-manifestation.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a07_9']	此中且據永對治說　第四句不斷起結不斷生結。	此中且據永對治說　第四句不斷起結不斷生結。	Here, it is said with reference to permanent elimination. The fourth case is not severing the fetter of arising and not severing the fetter of rebirth.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a07_14']	謂除前相。	謂除前相。	This refers to excluding the previous characteristics.

['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a09_5']	受中有故起結未斷。	受中有故起結未斷。	Because they undergo rebirth in the intermediate state, the fetter of arising is not yet severed.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0182a09_14']	受生有故生結未斷。	受生有故生結未斷。	Because they undergo rebirth in the existence of birth, the fetter of rebirth is not yet severed.

['ZH_T41_1821_010:0183c20_10']	夫死．生心是微劣故不能攝益。	夫死．生心是微劣故不能攝益。	The mind of death and rebirth is weak and cannot benefit.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0183c21_9']	即由此三因顯異地染心無死．生理。	即由此三因顯異地染心無死．生理。	By these three reasons, it is shown that the defiled mind of a different stage has no death and rebirth.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0183c21_14']	故正理云。	故正理云。	Therefore the correct principle says:
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0183c22_4']	異地染心亦攝益故。	異地染心亦攝益故。	The defiled mind of a different stage also benefits.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0183c22_13']	加行起故無命終理。	加行起故無命終理。	Because it arises from added effort, there is no principle of death.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0183c23_3']	異地染心必勝地攝。	異地染心必勝地攝。	The defiled mind of a different stage must be included in a superior stage.
['ZH_T41_1821_010:0183c23_12']	何容樂往劣地受生。	何容樂往劣地受生。	How could one willingly go to an inferior stage to be reborn?

The above is the original text. By these three reasons, it is also shown that pure and indeterminate minds of different realms and stages do not have the life-faculty that can receive life. Another explanation: Among the three reasons, it is only due to the first two.
