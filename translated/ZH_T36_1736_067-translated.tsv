The middle seven are only retribution and are therefore not action. The middle seven are also said to be both kinds of action, because they are associated with action.

['ZH_T36_1736_067:0540b28_13']	餘七唯是無覆無記，七分位中亦起善染故。	餘七唯是無覆無記，七分位中亦起善染故。	067	The remaining seven members are only non-obscured-neutral, because good and defiled dharmas also arise in the states of the seven members.
