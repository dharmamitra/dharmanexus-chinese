In my spare time from meditation, I examined and corrected it, roughly restoring the correct method. The strange teachings from the distant and vast Brahmanic countries were greatly washed away, and the doubts and suspicions in the sacred scriptures were thoroughly eliminated. I alone unfurled my eyebrows in the face of the profound secrets.

Therefore, I forcibly opened my bag and engaged in carving. At that time, in the spring of the dingyou year of the Hōō era, on the first day of the first month, the śramaṇa Jikmyō wrote this in his temporary residence to the east of Luoyang.

I have now examined several copies and collated them, but there are still errors. When reading it, gentlemen should fortunately find a good copy and re-examine and correct it.

If they cannot be corrected, they should be examined in the various copies, but if there is no basis, they should be left unchanged. Even if there are clear texts in the scriptures, if they are not based on them and this is deleted, the meaning can be understood.
