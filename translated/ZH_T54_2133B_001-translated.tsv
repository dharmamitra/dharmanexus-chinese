For those without characters, the sounds are corrected. These are all essential characters on the road. If one can learn this, then the rest of the language is all understood. It is different from the old thousand-character text. If one also studies the Siddham chapter, then in one or two years of reading Sanskrit texts, one will be able to translate.

In my spare time from meditation, I examined and corrected it, roughly restoring the correct method. The strange teachings from the distant and vast Brahmanic countries were greatly washed away, and the doubts and suspicions in the sacred scriptures were thoroughly eliminated. I alone unfurled my eyebrows in the face of the profound secrets.
['ZH_T54_2133B_001:1197b05_11']	顧其撰者之訓人汎愛之所及而吾焉廋哉於是強繙函囊從事彫鏤云時享保丁未之春建寅之望瑜伽乘沙門寂明書於洛東僑居。	顧其撰者之訓人汎愛之所及而吾焉廋哉於是強繙函囊從事彫鏤云時享保丁未之春建寅之望瑜伽乘沙門寂明書於洛東僑居。	001	However, the author's instructions to people are vast and loving, and I am still meager. Therefore, I forcibly opened my bag and engaged in carving. At that time, in the spring of the dingyou year of the Hōō era, on the first day of the first month, the śramaṇa Jikmyō wrote this in his temporary residence to the east of Luoyang.

This book is also known as the Sanskrit-Tang Thousand-Character Text. The Annen Roku records that it was brought back by Master Saichō. I have now examined several copies and collated them, but there are still errors. When reading it, gentlemen should fortunately find a good copy and re-examine and correct it.

If they cannot be corrected, they should be examined in the various copies, but if there is no basis, they should be left unchanged. Even if there are clear texts in the scriptures, if they are not based on them and this is deleted, the meaning can be understood.

They are simply following the world.

The four characters in a sentence are all押韻, but the number of writings and errors are numerous, and the arrangement of characters is chaotic. I have collated several copies, but there is nothing to be ordered, let alone comparing it with Sanskrit. Even if I were to compose a series of rhymes, how could I possibly finalize the languages of the two countries?
