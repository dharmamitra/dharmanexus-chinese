['ZH_T36_1736_008:0057a04_4']	以如來法身與彼聲聞法身平等無異，故與授記，非即具修功德行，故菩薩之人功德具足，聲聞之人功德未具足。	以如來法身與彼聲聞法身平等無異，故與授記，非即具修功德行，故菩薩之人功德具足，聲聞之人功德未具足。	008	Because the Dharma body of the Tathāgata is equal and no different from the Dharma body of those śrāvakas, therefore he gives them a prediction. It is not because they have already cultivated meritorious practices, therefore the person of bodhisattva is replete with merits, while the person of śrāvaka is not yet replete with merits.
