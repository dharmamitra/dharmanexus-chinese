['ZH_T32_1657_001:0505c06_6']	既屬著已，由近善惡自造諸業而入流轉或出涅槃，斯乃善順緣生道理，即是僧塞迦羅八底也、毘若南婆薄八底也。	既屬著已，由近善惡自造諸業而入流轉或出涅槃，斯乃善順緣生道理，即是僧塞迦羅八底也、毘若南婆薄八底也。	Having become dependent, by approaching good and evil and creating various karmas one enters into samsara or exits into nirvana. This is in accord with the principle of dependent origination, which is the saṃskṛta and asaṃskṛta.

['ZH_T32_1657_001:0505c09_16']	由增待其減，初者是無因。	由增待其減，初者是無因。	Because of the increase, you must allow a decrease. The first birth would be without a cause.

['ZH_T32_1657_001:0505c15_1']	由斯道理，彼新生論便應許有初一有情，由許增者待其減故，一切時中許有新生眾多有情。	由斯道理，彼新生論便應許有初一有情，由許增者待其減故，一切時中許有新生眾多有情。	Because of this principle, you must allow that there is a first sentient being. Because you allow an increase, you must allow a decrease. At all times, you allow that there are many sentient beings being born.

['ZH_T32_1657_001:0505c16_17']	若如此者能減轉少，乃至將終成唯獨一。	若如此者能減轉少，乃至將終成唯獨一。	If this is so, the decrease would be less and less, until in the end there would be only one.
['ZH_T32_1657_001:0505c18_6']	然此最初不待餘業便成最初，是無因有，斯固不能辨無因過。	然此最初不待餘業便成最初，是無因有，斯固不能辨無因過。	But this first one would not depend on another karma, and so would be the first without a cause. This is certainly not able to distinguish the fault of being without a cause.
['ZH_T32_1657_001:0505c19_1']	若言必定有增剩者，可招此過。	若言必定有增剩者，可招此過。	If it is said that there is definitely an increase or surplus, this fault can be incurred.

Because those with faith can only fully possess it in the eight unfree states, but those are precisely the most difficult states to attain.

This is what fools delight in.

Do they accept that the consciousness of a sentient being who has never existed suddenly arises due to the power of other karma, and is it perfumed or not?
