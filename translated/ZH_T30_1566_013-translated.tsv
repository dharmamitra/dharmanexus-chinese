['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a08_9']	今此品者亦為遮空所對治，令決定解第一義諦如來身故說。	今此品者亦為遮空所對治，令決定解第一義諦如來身故說。	013	This chapter is also to refute the opposite of emptiness, in order to make one decisively understand the Tathāgata's body of ultimate truth.

['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a10_7']	有自體，色等諸體是體故，譬如如來。	有自體，色等諸體是體故，譬如如來。	013	There is a self-nature, because the natures of form and so forth are natures, like the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a10_13']	何等是如來？	何等是如來？	013	What is the Tathāgata?
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a13_7']	謂金剛三昧解脫道同，起無間第十六剎那心，彼差別門初起剎那即名為智，此智是第一義諦如來智，所依陰亦名如來。	謂金剛三昧解脫道同，起無間第十六剎那心，彼差別門初起剎那即名為智，此智是第一義諦如來智，所依陰亦名如來。	013	It refers to the mind of the sixteenth moment that arises immediately after the vajra-like samādhi and the path of liberation, the initial arising of the gate of its distinctions is called wisdom. This wisdom is the wisdom of the Tathāgata of ultimate truth, and the aggregates that it relies on are also called the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a13_11']	論者言：	論者言：	013	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a14_17']	若依止世諦智、諸體及如來，有自性汝欲得取，此成我義。	若依止世諦智、諸體及如來，有自性汝欲得取，此成我義。	013	If you wish to grasp the intrinsic nature of the self-nature of the Tathāgata based on the wisdom of worldly truth and various bodies, this becomes my meaning.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a16_4']	今依第一義諦觀如來，若此智是陰自體者，已攝入諸陰中。	今依第一義諦觀如來，若此智是陰自體者，已攝入諸陰中。	013	Now, in the first truth, observing the Tathāgata, if this wisdom is the essence of the aggregates, it has already been included in the aggregates.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a16_14']	今遮如來，亦遮彼智。	今遮如來，亦遮彼智。	013	Now, the Tathāgata is refuted, and that wisdom is also refuted.

['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a19_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	013	The commentary says:
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a19_9']	陰者謂積聚義。	陰者謂積聚義。	013	Aggregates means the meaning of accumulation.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a20_5']	陰非如來者，如來自體非是陰故。	陰非如來者，如來自體非是陰故。	013	The Tathāgata is not the aggregates, because the essence of the Tathāgata is not the aggregates.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a22_1']	此中說驗，第一義中陰非如來，陰是起盡法故，譬如凡夫諸陰又如外四大等。	此中說驗，第一義中陰非如來，陰是起盡法故，譬如凡夫諸陰又如外四大等。	013	Here, a logical argument is presented: in the ultimate truth, the aggregates are not the Tathāgata, because the aggregates are phenomena that arise and cease, like the aggregates of ordinary beings or the external four great elements, etc.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a22_15']	如是以作故為因者，當廣說驗。	如是以作故為因者，當廣說驗。	013	Thus, using because of being produced as the reason, a logical argument will be extensively explained.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a24_2']	復次諸陰非如來，已遮此陰起法，亦遮實法，及遮色等陰故。	復次諸陰非如來，已遮此陰起法，亦遮實法，及遮色等陰故。	013	Furthermore, the aggregates are not the Tathāgata. This has already been refuted. The arising of dharmas is refuted, as well as real dharmas and the aggregates such as form.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a25_19']	復次今將智為一門，別遮第一義中智非如來，是起盡法故、是智故，譬如凡夫智。	復次今將智為一門，別遮第一義中智非如來，是起盡法故、是智故，譬如凡夫智。	013	Next, now taking wisdom as one door, separately refuting in the ultimate truth that wisdom is not the Tathāgata, because it is a dharma that arises and ceases, and because it is wisdom, like the wisdom of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a26_18']	諸外道等謂陰外有如來，以此方便成立於我。	諸外道等謂陰外有如來，以此方便成立於我。	013	Non-Buddhists and others consider that apart from the aggregates there is a Tathāgata, establishing this as a means to establish a self.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a28_10']	今答此故，若離陰外有如來者，無驗可令信解，如是離陰有如來者不然。	今答此故，若離陰外有如來者，無驗可令信解，如是離陰有如來者不然。	013	Now answering this, if apart from the aggregates there is a Tathāgata, there is no valid cognition that can bring about understanding. Thus it is not the case that apart from the aggregates there is a Tathāgata.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117a29_8', 'ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b01_9']	互無者，謂如來中無陰、陰中無如來。🔽如來中無陰者，譬如雪山中無藥，不得言有藥。	互無者，謂如來中無陰、陰中無如來。 如來中無陰者，譬如雪山中無藥，不得言有藥。	013	Mutual non-existence means that within the Tathāgata there are no aggregates, and within the aggregates there is no Tathāgata.🔽Within the Tathāgata there are no aggregates is like saying that on the Himalayas there are no medicinal herbs, and one cannot say that there are medicinal herbs.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b02_11']	陰中無如來者，譬如林中無師子，不得言有師子。	陰中無如來者，譬如林中無師子，不得言有師子。	013	Within the aggregates there is no Tathāgata is like saying that in a forest there are no lions, and one cannot say that there are lions.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b04_1']	非如來有陰者，如具足財者名為有財，不以不具足者名為有財。	非如來有陰者，如具足財者名為有財，不以不具足者名為有財。	013	The Tathāgata is not one who possesses the aggregates, just as one who is fully endowed with wealth is called one who has wealth, and one who is not fully endowed is not called one who has wealth.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b04_14']	如是以五種觀察，如來不成。	如是以五種觀察，如來不成。	013	In this way, through five kinds of investigations, the Tathāgata is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b06_15']	如所說觀察方便時無有如來，譬如收賊多獲眾人謂言是賊，及其撿驗還是好人無有實賊。	如所說觀察方便時無有如來，譬如收賊多獲眾人謂言是賊，及其撿驗還是好人無有實賊。	013	As explained, when investigating with skillful means, there is no Tathāgata, just as when many people are captured as thieves, they are considered to be thieves, but when they are examined, they are found to be good people, and there are no real thieves.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b07_8']	如是離陰之外何等是丈夫？	如是離陰之外何等是丈夫？	013	In this way, apart from the aggregates, what is a man?

['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b08_3', 'ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b08_15']	汝所說如來不成。🔽所說不成故，亦闕於譬喻。	汝所說如來不成。 所說不成故，亦闕於譬喻。	013	You say that the Tathāgata is not established.🔽Because what is said is not established, it also lacks a simile.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b09_5']	譬喻闕故，是立義有過。	譬喻闕故，是立義有過。	013	Because the simile is lacking, there is an error in the proposed thesis.

['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b14_14']	此謂有自體者，得如是過。	此謂有自體者，得如是過。	013	This means that one who has self-nature incurs such faults.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b15_4']	應作是知，如來無自體。	應作是知，如來無自體。	013	One should understand that the Tathāgata has no self-nature.
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b16_12']	此中說驗，於第一義中如來無自體，以假設故，譬如旋火輪；	此中說驗，於第一義中如來無自體，以假設故，譬如旋火輪；	013	Here, a logical argument is presented: in the ultimate truth, the Tathāgata has no self-nature, because he is a hypothetical entity, like a whirling fire wheel;
['ZH_T30_1566_013:0117b16_20']	無實故，譬如瓶。	無實故，譬如瓶。	013	Because he is unreal, like a pot.
