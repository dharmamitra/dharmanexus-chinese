This ultimate nature is not a separate dharma, but rather the absence of the previous two natures is the ultimate nature. The ultimate is characterized by the absence of characteristics and the absence of arising.
['ZH_T31_1617_001:0867c17_11']	一切有為法不出此分別、依他兩性，此二性既真實無相無生，由此理故一切諸法同一無性。	一切有為法不出此分別、依他兩性，此二性既真實無相無生，由此理故一切諸法同一無性。	001	All conditioned dharmas do not go beyond these two natures of discrimination and dependence on others.

It is neither a nature of existence nor a nature of non-existence, and is therefore called the nature of naturelessness.

This is because one first obtains the meaning and then distinguishes and establishes the name.
['ZH_T31_1617_001:0869a22_18']	三依名分別名自性者，謂此色名，如人雖得其名、未識此名品類，更復思量學其訓釋，是名依名分別名，乃至識名求其所訓品類亦爾。	三依名分別名自性者，謂此色名，如人雖得其名、未識此名品類，更復思量學其訓釋，是名依名分別名，乃至識名求其所訓品類亦爾。	001	Third, distinguishing the intrinsic nature of names based on names means that for this name form, although one obtains the name, one has not yet recognized the category of this name.
