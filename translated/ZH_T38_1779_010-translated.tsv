['ZH_T38_1779_010:0834c09_5']	別教正當菩薩道也，圓教或佛或菩薩也。	別教正當菩薩道也，圓教或佛或菩薩也。	010	The separate teaching is precisely the bodhisattva path, and the perfect teaching is either Buddha or bodhisattva.

Therefore, the Buddha realm is sometimes only in the perfect teaching, sometimes it retreats to the separate teaching, sometimes it takes both the stages and abodes, sometimes it submerges the stages and only takes the abodes, sometimes it is also in the cause, and sometimes it is only in the effect. Ultimately speaking, the perfect effect is correct.

Each of the one hundred realms is not apart from the place of practice. Therefore, know that in this [sutra], there is nothing that is not the correct cause of the two bodies, the conditions and understanding of the Dharma body, the three natures of a single thought, and the three virtues of birth and death.

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0840b24_17']	今云「出」者，字誤，即標云二亦名入是也。	今云「出」者，字誤，即標云二亦名入是也。	010	Now, leaving is a mistake in the text, which is the same as the heading that says two is also called entering.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0840b26_14']	然此不思議俗，望不思議真雖名為出，若望界內思議真俗，悉名為入，以入在宅內故。	然此不思議俗，望不思議真雖名為出，若望界內思議真俗，悉名為入，以入在宅內故。	010	However, this inconceivable conventional truth, although called leaving in comparison with the inconceivable ultimate truth, if compared with the conceivable conventional and ultimate truths within the realm, it is all called entering, because entering is within the house.

If you want an easy understanding, you should say that the two truths within the realm are compared to the two truths outside the realm, and both must be broken down from within to enter without. Therefore, the conventional truth outside the realm is also given the name of entering, and the two are also called entering.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0840c10_11']	此即初番意。	此即初番意。	010	This is the meaning of the first explanation.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0840c11_18']	若從被加出證小果，即從果外俗出界內真，即不二亦名出。	若從被加出證小果，即從果外俗出界內真，即不二亦名出。	010	If one leaves the empowerment and attains the fruit of the lesser vehicle, then one leaves the conventional truth outside the fruit and enters the truth within the realm. This is also called leaving the non-dual.

In each perfection, there are four things:

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845b21_18']	故《大論》云「釋迦法中無菩薩僧，文殊、彌勒皆聲聞眾中依次而坐。	故《大論》云「釋迦法中無菩薩僧，文殊、彌勒皆聲聞眾中依次而坐。	010	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says: In Śākyamuni's Dharma there are no bodhisattva monks. Mañjuśrī and Maitreya all sit in the order of the śrāvaka assembly.

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845b24_10']	故知非但戒同，所修禪定亦同二乘，但以慧勝故稱大乘。	故知非但戒同，所修禪定亦同二乘，但以慧勝故稱大乘。	010	Therefore, we know that it is not only the same in precepts, but the meditation and concentration that are cultivated are also the same as the two vehicles. It is only because of the superiority of wisdom that it is called the Great Vehicle.

If the three vehicles of the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings do not establish precepts separately, they are fully explained in the Lotus Sutra Profound Meaning.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845c02_3']	荊溪既云藏通三乘不別立戒，故知疏文且通總而指，兼含別圓菩薩也。	荊溪既云藏通三乘不別立戒，故知疏文且通總而指，兼含別圓菩薩也。	010	Since Jingxi says that the three vehicles of the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings do not separately establish precepts, we know that the passage in the commentary generally points to the precepts of the Distinct and Perfect Teachings, which are also included.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845c03_15']	以淨名答彼菩薩，說釋迦開五乘必該一代，是則二乘通兩、菩薩該三。	以淨名答彼菩薩，說釋迦開五乘必該一代，是則二乘通兩、菩薩該三。	010	Because Vimalakīrti's answer to the bodhisattvas says that Śākyamuni opened the five vehicles, it must cover the entire lifetime of the Buddha. This means that the two vehicles are common to both, and the bodhisattvas cover the three.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845c04_4']	疏文從省，且從三藏。	疏文從省，且從三藏。	010	The passage in the commentary is concise, and it is based on the Tripiṭaka Teaching.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845c05_11']	此中答意復該別圓，是故荊溪還指《法華玄》文料簡之相。	此中答意復該別圓，是故荊溪還指《法華玄》文料簡之相。	010	The meaning of the answer here also covers the Distinct and Perfect Teachings, and therefore Jingxi points back to the text of the Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sūtra to distinguish the characteristics.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845c06_4']	故彼文云「他云《梵網》是菩薩戒。	故彼文云「他云《梵網》是菩薩戒。	010	Therefore, that text says, Others say that the Brahma Net is the bodhisattva precepts.

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845c08_3']	眾既不別，戒何得異？	眾既不別，戒何得異？	010	Since the assembly is not separate, how can the precepts be different?

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0845c11_12']	三乘共眾外別有菩薩，故別有戒。	三乘共眾外別有菩薩，故別有戒。	010	Outside the assembly of the three vehicles, there are separate bodhisattvas, so there are separate precepts.

Therefore, the five hundred people heard the conventional and took it as true.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848b09_9']	「雖不彰至其義」者，謂《大品》但云三人同斷，《大經》但云謂俗為真，而宛有中道義也，已如向釋。	「雖不彰至其義」者，謂《大品》但云三人同斷，《大經》但云謂俗為真，而宛有中道義也，已如向釋。	010	Although it is not evident, its meaning is... means that the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra only says that the three people equally cut off [afflictions], and the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra only says that they take the conventional as true, yet it clearly has the meaning of the Middle Way, as has already been explained above.

For those with sharp faculties, seeing the principle in the truth of the common teachings becomes inconceivable. If based on those with sharp faculties, it is the same as one's own practice.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848b17_12']	化他權實義既相涉，故須辨相。	化他權實義既相涉，故須辨相。	010	Since the meanings of the provisional and real in transforming others overlap, it is necessary to distinguish the characteristics.

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848b22_8']	此取行人體物淺深，以喻秖一思議其利根頓見中道。	此取行人體物淺深，以喻秖一思議其利根頓見中道。	010	This refers to the practitioner's understanding of the shallow and deep nature of things, using it as a metaphor for the sharp faculties who suddenly see the Middle Way in the very same thought.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848b24_1']	文中云生滅無生之言，悉取體物之解以喻悟理淺深耳，非是約法也。	文中云生滅無生之言，悉取體物之解以喻悟理淺深耳，非是約法也。	010	The text says arising and ceasing, non-arising, all taking the understanding of the nature of things as a metaphor for the shallow and deep realization of the principle, not referring to the Dharma itself.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848b25_1']	智之下者，見森羅是四大，如藏教但見無常。	智之下者，見森羅是四大，如藏教但見無常。	010	The lower level of wisdom sees the myriad phenomena as the four elements, like the Tripiṭaka Teaching which only sees impermanence.

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848b28_12']	既對中下，任運是上，故不云上耳。	既對中下，任運是上，故不云上耳。	010	Since it is contrasted with the middle and lower levels, it is naturally the highest, so it is not called the highest.

['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848c01_5']	宛見思議中有頓義，既有於頓則亦屬不思議。	宛見思議中有頓義，既有於頓則亦屬不思議。	010	It clearly shows that within the conceivable there is the meaning of suddenness. Since there is suddenness, it also belongs to the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848c02_4']	但約菩薩，元始化他說於二教，唯是思議。	但約菩薩，元始化他說於二教，唯是思議。	010	However, in terms of bodhisattvas, the original establishment of teaching others in the two teachings is only conceivable.
['ZH_T38_1779_010:0848c03_1']	頓見由根，故使二教但是化他權實。	頓見由根，故使二教但是化他權實。	010	Sudden enlightenment is due to faculties, causing the two teachings to be only the provisional and real of teaching others.
