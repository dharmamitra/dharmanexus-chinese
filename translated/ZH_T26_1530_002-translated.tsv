The bliss of supreme enlightenment and the bliss of cutting off feeling, etc., are immeasurable merits.

Do those who have already become Buddhas not have this ability?
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0299b23_13']	無始時來眾生法爾，能化所化種性相屬，不相屬者即無化能，是故如來種種方便，化諸有情令得佛果，化彼所化。	無始時來眾生法爾，能化所化種性相屬，不相屬者即無化能，是故如來種種方便，化諸有情令得佛果，化彼所化。	002	Since beginningless time, sentient beings naturally have the ability to transform and the nature of being transformed. Those who are not related to each other have no ability to transform. Therefore, the Tathāgata uses various skillful means to transform sentient beings and enable them to attain the fruit of Buddhahood, transforming those who are to be transformed.

The World-Honored One, for the most part relying on these śrāvakas who dedicate themselves to enlightenment, spoke with an implied meaning, saying:

They were sustained by the joy and delight of the vast Dharma flavor, transcended the five fears, and single-mindedly entered the stage of irreversibility.

It can subdue demons and enemies, as it is said that if bodhisattvas know that all that is grasped at is not solid and do not greedily seek it, they can then subdue all demons and enemies.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300b25_1']	六、作意大，謂遠離一切聲聞獨覺繫念分別，即是遠分斷除一切二乘作意。	六、作意大，謂遠離一切聲聞獨覺繫念分別，即是遠分斷除一切二乘作意。	002	Sixth, the greatness of attention, which means being far removed from all the discriminating thoughts of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, which is precisely the elimination of all the attention of the two vehicles.

At that time, one is irreversibly predicted. In the first seven stages, there is still the operation of effort and function, and one has not yet attained the irreversible effortless path. In the other stages, one attains the effortless operation without effort and function, and irreversibly enters the stage of irreversibility. Because in the stage of irreversibility, the effortless path is irreversibly entered, therefore it is said to be irreversibly entering the stage of irreversibility.

In this stage, there is great compassion and great kindness. Due to these two, they are able to relieve all from the oppression of internal illnesses and so forth, and external poverty and so forth. Since these two often bring benefit and joy to sentient beings, those who attain this are called great in terms of karma.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300c13_12']	復次，皆住大乘者，謂住初地證得遍滿真法界時，初得真實大乘法故，名住大乘。	復次，皆住大乘者，謂住初地證得遍滿真法界時，初得真實大乘法故，名住大乘。	002	Next, all abide in the Great Vehicle means that when abiding in the first ground and realizing the all-pervading true Dharma realm, they initially attain the true Dharma of the Great Vehicle, and are thus called abiding in the Great Vehicle.

['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300c19_10']	諸分別者，即見所斷分別我見，初地已離。	諸分別者，即見所斷分別我見，初地已離。	002	The various discriminations are the discrimination of the view of self that is to be eliminated by the path of insight, which one is free from in the first stage.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300c20_9']	不分別者，即修所斷俱生我見，此地中離。	不分別者，即修所斷俱生我見，此地中離。	002	Nondiscrimination is the innate view of self that is to be eliminated by the path of cultivation, and one is free from it in this stage.

Even though one is free from them in sequence, they are mentioned together at the point of their total elimination, just as the fourth trance state is said to be free from suffering and happiness, and just as the third fruit is said to be free from the five lower parts.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300c23_17']	有義，此地第七識中俱生煩惱一切遠離。	有義，此地第七識中俱生煩惱一切遠離。	002	There is an interpretation that in this stage one is completely free from the innate passions in the seventh consciousness.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300c25_16']	有義，此地第六識中，俱生我見一切遠離，非第七識，以七地來猶有微細煩惱現行。	有義，此地第六識中，俱生我見一切遠離，非第七識，以七地來猶有微細煩惱現行。	002	According to another interpretation, in this stage one is completely free from the innate view of a self in the sixth consciousness, but not in the seventh, because up to the seventh stage there are still subtle activities of the passions.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300c26_11']	若無第七應無染依，應不似五。	若無第七應無染依，應不似五。	002	If there were no seventh consciousness, there would be no support for the passions, and it would not resemble the five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0300c28_4']	第七細惑若已遠離，五六七地六識麁惑應不現行，即違瑜伽解深密說。	第七細惑若已遠離，五六七地六識麁惑應不現行，即違瑜伽解深密說。	002	If the subtle passions of the seventh stage have already been eliminated, the gross passions of the sixth, seventh, and eighth consciousnesses should not be active, and this contradicts the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra and the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a01_15']	又如二乘金剛喻定，第七識惑與六識中最細煩惱一時俱斷，云何此中先離第七微細煩惱，後離六識麁煩惱耶？	又如二乘金剛喻定，第七識惑與六識中最細煩惱一時俱斷，云何此中先離第七微細煩惱，後離六識麁煩惱耶？	002	Also, it is like the diamond-like samādhi of the two vehicles, in which the passions of the seventh consciousness and the most subtle passions of the sixth consciousness are eliminated simultaneously. Why does this text say that one first eliminates the subtle passions of the seventh consciousness and then eliminates the gross passions of the sixth consciousness?
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a03_14']	是故四地得無我智，滅意識中俱生我見，未離第七微細煩惱，及六識中餘修斷惑。	是故四地得無我智，滅意識中俱生我見，未離第七微細煩惱，及六識中餘修斷惑。	002	Therefore, in the fourth stage one acquires knowledge of no-self and eliminates the innate view of a self in the sixth consciousness, but one has not yet eliminated the subtle passions of the seventh consciousness and the remaining passions of the sixth consciousness that are eliminated during the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a05_3']	此說伏離非是永滅，至第十地金剛心時方頓斷滅，修斷種故。	此說伏離非是永滅，至第十地金剛心時方頓斷滅，修斷種故。	002	This refers to subduing and eliminating them, not to their eternal annihilation, because it is not until the diamond-like concentration of the tenth stage that they are suddenly and completely eliminated, because the seeds of the passions eliminated during the path of cultivation are destroyed.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a06_16']	摧諸魔怨者，謂第五地觀四聖諦皆平等性，摧伏執取生死涅槃差別魔怨。	摧諸魔怨者，謂第五地觀四聖諦皆平等性，摧伏執取生死涅槃差別魔怨。	002	The text says that the bodhisattva CRUSHES the hosts of demons and enemies. This means that in the fifth stage, he contemplates the equality of the four noble truths and crushes the hosts of demons and enemies who grasp and cling to the difference between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a09_10']	遠離一切聲聞獨覺繫念分別者，謂第六地觀十二支染淨緣起皆平等性，遠離二乘厭患雜染、欣樂清淨繫念分別。	遠離一切聲聞獨覺繫念分別者，謂第六地觀十二支染淨緣起皆平等性，遠離二乘厭患雜染、欣樂清淨繫念分別。	002	Far removed from all the fixations and discriminations of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas means that in the sixth ground, one contemplates the equality of the twelve links of dependent arising, whether defiled or pure, and is far removed from the fixations and discriminations of the two vehicles, who are disgusted with defilements and delight in purity.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a11_4']	廣大法味喜樂所持者，謂第七地證無相理，於空智中起有勝行，受大法樂。	廣大法味喜樂所持者，謂第七地證無相理，於空智中起有勝行，受大法樂。	002	Sustained by the great joy and delight of the Dharma means that in the seventh ground, one realizes the principle of signlessness, and within the wisdom of emptiness, one gives rise to superior practices and experiences great joy in the Dharma.
['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a13_3']	超五怖畏者，謂第八地一切煩惱不復現行，離五怖因名超五怖，五怖畏果初地已離。	超五怖畏者，謂第八地一切煩惱不復現行，離五怖因名超五怖，五怖畏果初地已離。	002	Transcending the five fears means that in the eighth ground, all afflictions no longer manifest, and one is free from the five causes of fear, thus transcending the five fears. The five fruits of fear were already transcended in the first ground.

['ZH_T26_1530_002:0301a20_9']	妙生菩薩而為上首者，謂能發起圓滿功德諸三摩地，名為妙生。	妙生菩薩而為上首者，謂能發起圓滿功德諸三摩地，名為妙生。	002	Subhūti Bodhisattva was the foremost. This refers to the ability to give rise to the samādhi of perfect merit, which is called Subhūti.
