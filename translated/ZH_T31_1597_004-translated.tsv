This means that the objects of consciousness are only the appearances of consciousness, and there is no meaning of separate objects.
['ZH_T31_1597_004:0338c25_8']	復舉識者，顯我所說定識所行，唯識所現無別有體。	復舉識者，顯我所說定識所行，唯識所現無別有體。	004	Furthermore, mentioning consciousness shows that what I say definitely refers to the objects of consciousness, which are only the appearances of consciousness and do not have a separate substance.

['ZH_T31_1597_004:0339a05_9']	此亦爾者。	此亦爾者。	004	This is also like that.
['ZH_T31_1597_004:0339a07_4']	聞思兩慧境既謝往、現無有體，於無體中若更生時，但識影現似彼而生故。	聞思兩慧境既謝往、現無有體，於無體中若更生時，但識影現似彼而生故。	004	Since the objects of the two kinds of understanding derived from hearing and reflection have already passed away and do not exist in the present, when they are born again in the future, they are only the appearance of consciousness that resembles them.
['ZH_T31_1597_004:0339a08_16']	聞思慧不緣謝往曾所受境，是故唯識由此彌彰所取義無，理亦成就。	聞思慧不緣謝往曾所受境，是故唯識由此彌彰所取義無，理亦成就。	004	Therefore, the understanding derived from hearing and reflection does not take as objects the objects that have been experienced in the past. For this reason, the meaning of the absence of objects is established by this [fact of consciousness only].
