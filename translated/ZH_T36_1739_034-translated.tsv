The bodhisattvas of provisional teachings and the two vehicles all detest and abandon them, while the bodhisattvas of the One Vehicle take this deluded ignorance and the twelve links of dependent arising as the ocean of the omniscience of the Tathāgata.

The meaning clarifies that the ocean of birth and death and dependent arising of all sentient beings is vast and immeasurable, with no middle or edges, and its nature and characteristics can be attained, thus becoming the ocean of the Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_034:0957a28_5']	思惟大海無量眾寶奇妙莊嚴者，明觀生死緣生海，便成自性清淨佛之智海，即一切智寶功德莊嚴。	思惟大海無量眾寶奇妙莊嚴者，明觀生死緣生海，便成自性清淨佛之智海，即一切智寶功德莊嚴。	Contemplating the great ocean as immeasurable, adorned with wondrous and marvelous treasures, clarifies that contemplating the ocean of dependent arising in birth and death immediately becomes the ocean of the Buddha's wisdom of intrinsic purity, adorned with the merit and virtue of all wisdom-treasures.

['ZH_T36_1739_034:0957b07_3']	思惟大海能受大雲所雨之雨者，菩薩心海堪受大雲諸佛法雨。	思惟大海能受大雲所雨之雨者，菩薩心海堪受大雲諸佛法雨。	Contemplating the great ocean as able to receive the rain from the great clouds means the ocean of the bodhisattva's mind is able to receive the Dharma rain of the great clouds of all Buddhas.

['ZH_T36_1739_034:0957b11_1']	便見海中有大蓮華忽然出現，其上有佛說《普眼經》，意明自觀生死海，便為自己如來清淨智海。	便見海中有大蓮華忽然出現，其上有佛說《普眼經》，意明自觀生死海，便為自己如來清淨智海。	Then one sees a great lotus flower suddenly appearing in the ocean, with a Buddha on it expounding the Sutra of Universal Vision. This clarifies that one's own view of the sea of birth and death becomes one's own Tathāgata's pure ocean of wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_034:0957b13_18']	自佛出興根本智差別智，究竟不離此生死海中圓滿故，十力、四無畏、一切智智海，皆迴生死海廣大業力而成就之，生死業果盡。	自佛出興根本智差別智，究竟不離此生死海中圓滿故，十力、四無畏、一切智智海，皆迴生死海廣大業力而成就之，生死業果盡。	The Buddha's appearance, fundamental wisdom, and discriminating wisdom, ultimately do not leave this sea of birth and death, as they are perfected within it. Therefore, the ocean of the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and omniscience is accomplished by the vast power of the karmic activity of the sea of birth and death. The fruits of birth and death and karmic activity are exhausted.
['ZH_T36_1739_034:0957b16_4']	一切智智海如是成自己如來廣大智海、普賢行海，不離一切眾生及自己十二有支緣生行海中。	一切智智海如是成自己如來廣大智海、普賢行海，不離一切眾生及自己十二有支緣生行海中。	The ocean of omniscience is thus accomplished as one's own vast ocean of Tathāgata wisdom and the ocean of Samantabhadra's practices, not apart from the ocean of dependent arising and practices of the twelve links of dependent origination of all sentient beings and oneself.
['ZH_T36_1739_034:0957b17_3']	若離此者別有成佛處所法者，無有是處。	若離此者別有成佛處所法者，無有是處。	If one leaves this and has a separate place and method for becoming a Buddha, it is impossible.

This represents realizing ignorance and all the links of existence as the great ocean of wisdom, and the virtues and rewards born from wisdom and practice.
