['ZH_T29_1563_027:0903c23_17']	辯隨眠品第六之三如上所辯十種隨眠，次第生時誰前誰後？	辯隨眠品第六之三如上所辯十種隨眠，次第生時誰前誰後？	027	Chapter 6, Part 3: Distinguishing Latent Tendencies. As explained above, the ten kinds of latent tendencies arise in sequence. Which comes before and which comes after?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0903c24_16']	諸隨眠起無定次第，可一切後一切生故。	諸隨眠起無定次第，可一切後一切生故。	027	The arising of latent tendencies has no fixed sequence, because all can arise after all.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0903c25_15']	然有一類煩惱現行，前後相牽非無次第。	然有一類煩惱現行，前後相牽非無次第。	027	However, there is one type of manifestation of afflictions that draws on each other before and after, and there is not no sequence.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0903c26_8']	就此一類辯次第者，頌曰：	就此一類辯次第者，頌曰：	027	In discussing this one type, the verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0903c27_0']	無明疑邪身，　　邊見戒見取，	無明疑邪身，　　邊見戒見取，	027	Ignorance, doubt, wrong views, extreme views, adherence to rules and rituals, and attachment to views,
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0903c28_13']	貪慢瞋如次，　　由前引後生。	貪慢瞋如次，　　由前引後生。	027	Greed, pride, and anger arise in sequence, drawn out by the preceding ones.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0903c29_2']	論曰：	論曰：	027	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a01_10']	謂彼煩惱次第生時，先由無明於諦不了，不欲觀苦乃至道諦。	謂彼煩惱次第生時，先由無明於諦不了，不欲觀苦乃至道諦。	027	That is to say, when the sequence of afflictions arises, first due to ignorance one does not understand the truths, and does not wish to contemplate suffering up to the truth of the path.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a02_13']	由不了故無觀察能，既聞二途便懷猶豫，為苦非苦？	由不了故無觀察能，既聞二途便懷猶豫，為苦非苦？	027	Due to not understanding, one lacks the ability to contemplate. Having heard the two paths, one then harbors doubt, whether it is suffering or not suffering?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a03_12']	乃至廣說，若遇邪論便生邪見，撥無苦諦。	乃至廣說，若遇邪論便生邪見，撥無苦諦。	027	and so on at length. If one encounters false theories, one gives rise to false views and denies the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a04_16']	乃至廣說，於取蘊中既撥無苦，因此便起薩迦耶見。	乃至廣說，於取蘊中既撥無苦，因此便起薩迦耶見。	027	and so on at length. Having denied the existence of suffering in the aggregates that are grasped, one gives rise to the view of the aggregates as a real self.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a06_5']	從此復執我有斷常，隨執一邊計為能淨，於如是計執為第一。	從此復執我有斷常，隨執一邊計為能淨，於如是計執為第一。	027	From this, one further grasps the self as either annihilated or eternal, and following this grasping of one extreme or the other, one takes it as able to purify, and takes this as the foremost.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a09_2']	見已見德緣之起貪，謂此勝他恃而生慢，於他所起違見生瞋，如執我徒憎無我見，或於己見取捨位中，必應起瞋憎嫌所捨。	見已見德緣之起貪，謂此勝他恃而生慢，於他所起違見生瞋，如執我徒憎無我見，或於己見取捨位中，必應起瞋憎嫌所捨。	027	Having seen this view as virtuous, one gives rise to craving based on it, thinking that it is superior to others, and one gives rise to pride based on this. One gives rise to anger toward others' views that contradict one's own, such as hating the view of no-self in those who grasp at a self, or in the state of accepting or rejecting one's own views, one must give rise to anger, hating what is rejected.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a10_1']	此依一類辯十隨眠，相牽現行前後次第。	此依一類辯十隨眠，相牽現行前後次第。	027	This distinguishes the ten latent afflictions based on one type, and the sequence of their appearance through mutual instigation.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a11_1']	理實煩惱行次無邊，以所待緣有差別故。	理實煩惱行次無邊，以所待緣有差別故。	027	In reality, the sequence of the afflictions' activity is limitless, because the conditions that are relied upon have distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a11_10']	諸煩惱起由幾因緣？	諸煩惱起由幾因緣？	027	By how many causes and conditions do the afflictions arise?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a12_8']	此起因緣乃有多種，隨麁就勝要唯有三。	此起因緣乃有多種，隨麁就勝要唯有三。	027	There are many causes and conditions for their arising, but following the gross and the most important, there are only three.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a12_11']	頌曰：	頌曰：	027	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a13_0']	由未斷隨眠，　　及隨應境現，	由未斷隨眠，　　及隨應境現，	027	Because the latent afflictions have not yet been eliminated, and the corresponding objects appear,
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a14_13']	非理作意起，　　說惑具因緣。	非理作意起，　　說惑具因緣。	027	And improper attention arises, it is said that the afflictions are endowed with causes and conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a15_2']	論曰：	論曰：	027	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a15_11']	由三因緣諸煩惱起。	由三因緣諸煩惱起。	027	The arising of the afflictions is due to three causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a17_16', 'ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a18_1']	且如將起欲貪隨眠，未斷未遍知欲貪隨眠故，順欲貪境現在前故，緣彼非理作意起故，餘隨眠起。🔽類此應知。	且如將起欲貪隨眠，未斷未遍知欲貪隨眠故，順欲貪境現在前故，緣彼非理作意起故，餘隨眠起。 類此應知。	027	For example, when about to give rise to the latent afflictions of desire and greed, because the latent afflictions of desire and greed have not yet been eliminated or thoroughly known, because objects that accord with desire and greed are present, and because improper attention arises in relation to them, the latent afflictions arise. The arising of the other latent afflictions should be understood in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a20_1']	未斷未遍知欲貪隨眠者，三緣故說未斷遍知，謂得未斷故、對治未生故、未遍知境故。	未斷未遍知欲貪隨眠者，三緣故說未斷遍知，謂得未斷故、對治未生故、未遍知境故。	027	The latent afflictions of desire and greed have not yet been eliminated or thoroughly known means that they are said to have not yet been eliminated or thoroughly known for three reasons: because they have not yet been eliminated, because their antidotes have not yet arisen, and because their objects have not yet been thoroughly known.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a20_16']	又斷有二，一有分斷、二無分斷。	又斷有二，一有分斷、二無分斷。	027	Moreover, there are two kinds of elimination: elimination in part and complete elimination.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a21_4']	故說未斷未遍知言。	故說未斷未遍知言。	027	Therefore, the words not yet eliminated or thoroughly known are used.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a23_2']	此說隨眠由因力起，順欲貪境現在前者，謂有實境順欲貪纏，此若現前欲貪便起。	此說隨眠由因力起，順欲貪境現在前者，謂有實境順欲貪纏，此若現前欲貪便起。	027	This explains that the latent afflictions arise due to the power of causes. Objects that accord with desire and greed are present means that there are real objects that accord with the fetters of desire and greed. If these are present, desire and greed will arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a23_13']	此則說隨眠由境界力起。	此則說隨眠由境界力起。	027	This explains that the latent afflictions arise due to the power of objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a25_12']	緣彼非理作意起者，謂有如木境界現前及有如鑽燧，非理作意起鑽境界木欲貪火生。	緣彼非理作意起者，謂有如木境界現前及有如鑽燧，非理作意起鑽境界木欲貪火生。	027	As for arising from improper attention towards them, it means that when there is an object present like wood and there is improper attention like a drill, the fire of desire and greed arises from drilling the object like wood.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a26_3']	此中何名非理作意？	此中何名非理作意？	027	What is called improper attention in this context?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a28_12']	謂於上妙衣服花鬘嚴具塗香彫粧采飾嬌姿所顯女想，糞聚起有情想，所住持心俱顛倒警覺，名非理作意。	謂於上妙衣服花鬘嚴具塗香彫粧采飾嬌姿所顯女想，糞聚起有情想，所住持心俱顛倒警覺，名非理作意。	027	It refers to the notion of a woman manifested by fine clothes, flower garlands, ornaments, perfumes, cosmetics, and flirtatious poses, the notion of a sentient being towards a heap of excrement, and the inverted and agitated state of mind that grasps onto them, which is called improper attention.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904a29_4']	此則說隨眠由加行力起。	此則說隨眠由加行力起。	027	This explains that the latent afflictions arise due to the power of application.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b01_3']	若隨眠起具三因緣，云何許有阿羅漢退？	若隨眠起具三因緣，云何許有阿羅漢退？	027	If the arising of latent afflictions requires all three conditions, how can one admit the retrogression of arhats?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b02_11']	非阿羅漢隨眠未斷，且非定許煩惱現前，方得名為阿羅漢退。	非阿羅漢隨眠未斷，且非定許煩惱現前，方得名為阿羅漢退。	027	Arhats do not necessarily allow the manifest afflictions to arise, and only then can they be said to retrogress from arhatship.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b03_10']	然此且據從前煩惱無間引生，故說無過。	然此且據從前煩惱無間引生，故說無過。	027	However, this is based on the uninterrupted arising of afflictions from before, so there is no fault.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b04_17']	以煩惱生總有二種，一從煩惱無間引生、二次所餘非煩惱起。	以煩惱生總有二種，一從煩惱無間引生、二次所餘非煩惱起。	027	Afflictions arise in two ways: first, they are produced immediately by other afflictions; second, they are produced by other dharmas that are not afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b05_16']	若異此者，善無記心無間不應有煩惱起。	若異此者，善無記心無間不應有煩惱起。	027	If this were not so, then afflictions would not arise immediately after good and indeterminate minds.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b06_15']	此中不據次所餘生，是故不應舉退為難。	此中不據次所餘生，是故不應舉退為難。	027	Here, we are not discussing the second kind of arising, and therefore you should not raise the question of falling away from the good.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b07_19']	或此且據具因緣說，實有唯託境界力生，無有因力。	或此且據具因緣說，實有唯託境界力生，無有因力。	027	Or, this is said with reference to afflictions that have all their causes complete. In reality, there are those that arise by the power of the object alone and not by the power of causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b09_3']	加行力者，即上所說隨眠并伴，佛說為漏瀑流軛取。	加行力者，即上所說隨眠并伴，佛說為漏瀑流軛取。	027	The power of added effort refers to the above-mentioned proclivities together with their associates. The Buddha calls them ASAVA, OGHAS, YOGA, and UPADANA.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b10_1']	漏謂三漏，一欲漏、二有漏、三無明漏。	漏謂三漏，一欲漏、二有漏、三無明漏。	027	ASAVA means the three asavas: 1) the asava of desire, 2) the asava of existence, and 3) the asava of ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b11_7']	瀑流有四，一欲瀑流、二有瀑流、三見瀑流、四無明瀑流。	瀑流有四，一欲瀑流、二有瀑流、三見瀑流、四無明瀑流。	027	OGHAS are four: 1) the oghas of desire, 2) the oghas of existence, 3) the oghas of views, and 4) the oghas of ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b11_17']	軛謂四軛，如瀑流說。	軛謂四軛，如瀑流說。	027	YOGAS are four, as explained in the case of the oghas.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b12_19']	取謂四取，一欲取、二見取、三戒禁取、四我語取。	取謂四取，一欲取、二見取、三戒禁取、四我語取。	027	UPADANAS are four: 1) the upadana of desire, 2) the upadana of views, 3) the upadana of morality and asceticism, and 4) the upadana of self-doctrine.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b13_7']	如是漏等其體云何？	如是漏等其體云何？	027	What are the natures of these contaminants, etc.?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b13_10']	頌曰：	頌曰：	027	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b14_0']	欲煩惱并纏，　　除癡名欲漏，	欲煩惱并纏，　　除癡名欲漏，	027	The contaminants of desire are called the desire-corruptions,
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b15_0']	有漏上二界，　　唯煩惱除癡，	有漏上二界，　　唯煩惱除癡，	027	The corruptions of existence are the contaminants of the two upper realms, excluding delusion.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b16_0']	同無記對治，　　定地故合一，	同無記對治，　　定地故合一，	027	Because they are the same in being indeterminate, because they are antidotes to the concentrations, and because they are realms, they are combined into one.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b17_13']	無明諸有本，　　故別為一漏。	無明諸有本，　　故別為一漏。	027	Because ignorance is the root of all existence, it is established separately as a corruption.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b18_0']	瀑流軛亦然，　　別立見利故，	瀑流軛亦然，　　別立見利故，	027	The floods and bonds are also like this. The views are established separately because they are sharp.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b19_13']	見不順住故，　　非於漏獨立。	見不順住故，　　非於漏獨立。	027	Because views do not accord with abiding, they are not established separately as corruptions.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b20_0']	欲有軛并癡，　　見分二名取，	欲有軛并癡，　　見分二名取，	027	The bonds of desire and existence, together with delusion, are divided into two parts, called the grasping of desire and the grasping of views.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b21_13']	無明不別立，　　以非能取故。	無明不別立，　　以非能取故。	027	Ignorance is not established separately, because it is not a grasper.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b22_2']	論曰：	論曰：	027	The Treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b23_16']	欲界煩惱并纏除癡四十一物，總名欲漏，謂欲界繫根本煩惱三十一并十纏。	欲界煩惱并纏除癡四十一物，總名欲漏，謂欲界繫根本煩惱三十一并十纏。	027	The contaminants of the desire realm, together with the entanglements, excluding delusion, are forty-one things in total, called the desire corruptions. This refers to the thirty-one fundamental contaminants bound to the desire realm, together with the ten entanglements.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b27_3']	色無色界煩惱除癡五十二物，總名有漏，謂上二界根本煩惱各二十六，色無色界雖復亦有惛沈、掉舉，而纏不應依界分別，上界纏少不自在故。	色無色界煩惱除癡五十二物，總名有漏，謂上二界根本煩惱各二十六，色無色界雖復亦有惛沈、掉舉，而纏不應依界分別，上界纏少不自在故。	027	The afflictions of the form and formless realms, excluding delusion, consist of fifty-two things, which are generally called impure. This means that the fundamental afflictions of the two upper realms are each twenty-six. Although the form and formless realms also have torpor and restlessness, the entanglements should not be distinguished according to realm, because the entanglements of the upper realms are few and not autonomous.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b28_10']	由是有漏唯說煩惱，若纏亦依界分別者，則有漏體有五十六。	由是有漏唯說煩惱，若纏亦依界分別者，則有漏體有五十六。	027	Therefore, impurity is said to refer only to the afflictions. If the entanglements were also distinguished according to realm, then the substance of impurity would be fifty-six.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b28_21']	故《品類足》作如是言：	故《品類足》作如是言：	027	Therefore, the Abhidharma-nyāyânusāra-śāstra says:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904b29_4']	云何有漏？	云何有漏？	027	What is impurity?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c01_8']	謂除無明，餘色無色二界所繫結縛隨眠、隨煩惱纏。	謂除無明，餘色無色二界所繫結縛隨眠、隨煩惱纏。	027	It means the fetters, bonds, propensities, secondary afflictions, and entanglements associated with the two realms of form and formlessness, excluding ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c02_2']	何緣合說二界煩惱為一有漏？	何緣合說二界煩惱為一有漏？	027	Why are the afflictions of the two realms combined and called impurity?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c02_17']	同無記性、同一對治、同定地故。	同無記性、同一對治、同定地故。	027	Because they are both indeterminate natures, have the same antidote, and belong to the same stage of concentration.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c03_14']	亦緣色聲觸為境故，不應唯說於內門轉。	亦緣色聲觸為境故，不應唯說於內門轉。	027	They also take form, sound, and touch as objects, so they should not be said to only occur in the internal realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c04_15']	義准三界十五無明為無明漏體，故頌不別說。	義准三界十五無明為無明漏體，故頌不別說。	027	The principle of interpretation is that the substance of the ignorance āsaṃprajñāta of the three realms is the fifteen ignorances, and therefore the verse does not mention them separately.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c05_5']	何緣唯此別立漏名？	何緣唯此別立漏名？	027	Why are only these established separately as the name “outflows”?
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c05_14']	為顯無明過患勝故。	為顯無明過患勝故。	027	In order to reveal the superiority of the faults of ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c06_9']	謂獨能作生死根本，如契經說：	謂獨能作生死根本，如契經說：	027	That is, it is able to be the root of saṃsāra alone, as a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c07_3']	無明為因生於貪染，乃至廣說。	無明為因生於貪染，乃至廣說。	027	Ignorance is the cause that produces attachment, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c07_8']	又如頌言：	又如頌言：	027	Also, a verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c08_0']	「諸所有惡趣，　　此及他世間，	「諸所有惡趣，　　此及他世間，	027	All evil destinies, here and in other worlds,
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c09_13']	皆無明為根，　　貪欲所等起。	皆無明為根，　　貪欲所等起。	027	Are all rooted in ignorance, and arise from craving.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c13_14']	」今於此中唯據勝顯說一百八諸惑為漏，謂非染污思等恨等非漏所攝，唯此諸惑稽留有情久住生死，或令流轉於生死中，從有頂天至無間獄用強易了，是故偏說。	」今於此中唯據勝顯說一百八諸惑為漏，謂非染污思等恨等非漏所攝，唯此諸惑稽留有情久住生死，或令流轉於生死中，從有頂天至無間獄用強易了，是故偏說。	027	Here, only the one hundred and eight passions that are superior and obvious are said to be outflows. That is, defiled thoughts, etc., and resentment, etc., are not included in the outflows. Only these passions keep beings dwelling in saṃsāra for a long time, or cause them to transmigrate in saṃsāra, from the heaven of the summit of existence down to the Avīci hell. Their power is strong and easy to understand, and therefore they are mentioned separately.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c15_18']	瀑流及軛體與漏同，然於其中見亦別立，謂前欲漏即欲瀑流及欲軛，如是有漏即有瀑流及有軛。	瀑流及軛體與漏同，然於其中見亦別立，謂前欲漏即欲瀑流及欲軛，如是有漏即有瀑流及有軛。	027	The bodies of the floods and bonds are the same as those of the contaminants, but in them views are established separately. That is, the flood and bond of desire are the same as the contaminant of desire. The flood and bond of existence are the same as the contaminant of existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c16_17']	析出諸見為見瀑流及見軛者，以猛利故。	析出諸見為見瀑流及見軛者，以猛利故。	027	The reason views are separated out and established as the flood and bond of views is because they are sharp.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c18_8']	謂漂合執義，立瀑流軛取，如餘煩惱，但除無明，總互相資能漂合執。	謂漂合執義，立瀑流軛取，如餘煩惱，但除無明，總互相資能漂合執。	027	The meaning of “flooding” and “binding” is established as the floods and bonds, just as the other passions do, with the exception of ignorance, which in general mutually assist each other in flooding, binding, and grasping.
['ZH_T29_1563_027:0904c19_16']	諸見亦爾，由猛利故，離餘相助能漂合執，故亦別立瀑流軛取。	諸見亦爾，由猛利故，離餘相助能漂合執，故亦別立瀑流軛取。	027	The same is true of the views, because they are sharp.

Therefore, only when one eternally eliminates the passions to be eliminated by the path of insight is one said to be a person who practices the path that conforms to the upper stage.
