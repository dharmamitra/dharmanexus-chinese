['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c09_13']	於當所辯異熟、等流、離繫、士用及增上果，如是五果對前六因，當言何果何因所得？	於當所辯異熟、等流、離繫、士用及增上果，如是五果對前六因，當言何果何因所得？	018	Among the five effects to be distinguished - the effect of karmic maturation, the effect of outflow, the effect of separation, the effect of human action, and the dominant effect - which effect is obtained by which cause among the previous six causes?

['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c10_0']	後因果異熟，　　前因增上果，	後因果異熟，　　前因增上果，	018	The effect of karmic maturation is the effect of the last cause, and the dominant effect is the effect of the first cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c11_13']	同類遍等流，　　俱相應士用。	同類遍等流，　　俱相應士用。	018	The effect of outflow is the effect of the homogeneous cause, the universal cause, and so forth, and the effect of human action is the effect of the associated cause and the co-existent cause.

['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c13_10']	於五果中，第三離繫非生因得，故此不論，且辯六因得餘四果。	於五果中，第三離繫非生因得，故此不論，且辯六因得餘四果。	018	Among the five effects, the third effect of separation is not obtained by the cause of birth, therefore it is not discussed here. The remaining four effects obtained by the six causes will now be discussed.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c14_8']	言後因者，謂異熟因，於因頌中最後說故。	言後因者，謂異熟因，於因頌中最後說故。	018	The last cause refers to the cause of karmic maturation, because it is mentioned last in the verse on the causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c14_18']	初異熟果，此因所得。	初異熟果，此因所得。	018	The first effect of karmic maturation is obtained by this cause.

['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c15_17']	異熟從異熟生，故此不應名無異熟。	異熟從異熟生，故此不應名無異熟。	018	Because the effect of retribution arises from the cause of retribution, it should not be called nonretribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c16_16']	彼言非理，同類異熟二因所生，義各別故。	彼言非理，同類異熟二因所生，義各別故。	018	This is unreasonable, because the two causes of similar status and retribution produce effects that are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c17_14']	謂前異熟為同類因，生後異熟為等流果。	謂前異熟為同類因，生後異熟為等流果。	018	That is, the former effect of retribution is the similar cause that produces the latter effect of retribution, which is the effect similar to the cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c18_14']	即後異熟由先業成，能成諸業，名異熟因；	即後異熟由先業成，能成諸業，名異熟因；	018	The latter effect of retribution is accomplished by prior karma. The karma that accomplishes it is called the cause of retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c19_3']	所成異熟，即異熟果。	所成異熟，即異熟果。	018	The effect of retribution that is accomplished is the effect of retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c20_2']	二因體異，二果義分，因果類殊，無相雜過。	二因體異，二果義分，因果類殊，無相雜過。	018	The two causes are different, and the two effects are distinguished. The classes of causes and effects are different, and there is no error of confusion.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c22_1']	然異熟體，如熟飲食，於生異熟無勝功能，故唯不善及善有漏是異熟因，名有異熟。	然異熟體，如熟飲食，於生異熟無勝功能，故唯不善及善有漏是異熟因，名有異熟。	018	However, the substance of the effect of retribution is like cooked food and drink. It has no superior function in producing the effect of retribution. Therefore only the unwholesome and the wholesome that is impure is the cause of retribution and is called having retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c23_1']	言前因者，謂能作因，於因頌中最初說故。	言前因者，謂能作因，於因頌中最初說故。	018	The former cause refers to the efficient cause, because it is mentioned first in the verse on causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c23_11']	後增上果，此因所得。	後增上果，此因所得。	018	The latter dominant effect is obtained by this cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c24_1']	增上之果，名增上果。	增上之果，名增上果。	018	The effect of the dominant condition is called the dominant effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c24_11']	唯無障住，有何增上？	唯無障住，有何增上？	018	What is the dominant condition of mere nonobstruction?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c25_10']	豈不即由無障住故說為增上，何勞徵詰？	豈不即由無障住故說為增上，何勞徵詰？	018	Is it not said that the dominant condition is that which is not obstructive? Why is it necessary to ask?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0435c27_17']	又先已辯能作因中，說能作因亦有勝力，謂眼識等於正生時，耳等展轉有增上力，聞已便生欣見欲故。	又先已辯能作因中，說能作因亦有勝力，謂眼識等於正生時，耳等展轉有增上力，聞已便生欣見欲故。	018	Also, it has already been explained in the section on the efficient cause that the efficient cause also has a superior power, namely, that when visual consciousness, etc., are about to arise, the auditory, etc., have a dominant power over them, because when one hears, one immediately wishes to see.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a01_14']	於器世界諸物生時，諸有情業有增上力，諸可愛果於不善業、不可愛果於諸善業亦有展轉增上生用，此等增上如應當思。	於器世界諸物生時，諸有情業有增上力，諸可愛果於不善業、不可愛果於諸善業亦有展轉增上生用，此等增上如應當思。	018	When the various things of the receptacle world are born, the actions of sentient beings have a dominant power. There is a dominant power in the production of desirable results from good actions and undesirable results from bad actions. These dominant powers should be considered as appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a02_13']	同類、遍行得等流果，果似因故名為等流。	同類、遍行得等流果，果似因故名為等流。	018	Homogeneous and omnipresent causes obtain an outflow result, because the result resembles the cause and is called an outflow.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a03_12']	如是二因，果相相似，故因雖二其果唯一。	如是二因，果相相似，故因雖二其果唯一。	018	These two causes have similar characteristics in their results, and therefore, although there are two causes, there is only one result.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a05_2']	俱有、相應得士用果，非越士體有別士用，即此所得名士用果。	俱有、相應得士用果，非越士體有別士用，即此所得名士用果。	018	Concomitant and simultaneous causes obtain a result that is a human effort, because there is no human effort apart from the substance of the human being. The result obtained is called a result that is a human effort.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a05_11']	此士用名為目何法？	此士用名為目何法？	018	What does this term human effort refer to?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a06_11']	即目諸法所有功能，如是冥符後頌文說：	即目諸法所有功能，如是冥符後頌文說：	018	It refers to the power possessed by dharmas, which corresponds to the following verse:
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a07_3']	若因彼力生，是果名士用。	若因彼力生，是果名士用。	018	If a result arises due to the power of that [cause], it is called the effect of human action.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a08_11']	然經主謂此士用名即目諸法所有作用，是則彼應作如是說：	然經主謂此士用名即目諸法所有作用，是則彼應作如是說：	018	However, the author of the commentary takes this term effect of human action to refer to the activity possessed by dharmas. He should have said:
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a09_1']	同牽一果故名士用。	同牽一果故名士用。	018	Because they jointly attract one result, they are called the effect of human action.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a11_7']	若爾，唯應無間隔越有士用果，俱生中無，非俱生中可有一切皆共同得一士用果，自體不因自力生故。	若爾，唯應無間隔越有士用果，俱生中無，非俱生中可有一切皆共同得一士用果，自體不因自力生故。	018	If that is so, then there should only be the effect of human action that is immediately contiguous or separated, not that which arises simultaneously. It is not possible that within the simultaneous [cause and effect] there could be all [dharmas] jointly obtaining one effect of human action, because the self-nature does not arise due to the power of the self.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a12_6']	亦不可說各別牽果，勿俱有因非一果故。	亦不可說各別牽果，勿俱有因非一果故。	018	It also cannot be said that each individually attracts a result, lest the co-existent cause not be a single result.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a14_14']	此中士用、士力、士能、士之勢分，義皆無別，諸法功能如士用故名為士用，如勇健人似師子故名為師子。	此中士用、士力、士能、士之勢分，義皆無別，諸法功能如士用故名為士用，如勇健人似師子故名為師子。	018	Here, the effect of human action, human power, human ability, and the power of the human being all have no difference in meaning. Because the power of dharmas is like the effect of human action, it is called the effect of human action, just as a brave and strong person is called a lion because he resembles a lion.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a18_4']	豈不同類、遍行二因無間所生亦士用果，然等流果二因無間所生諸法，或是或非一切決定名士用果，何故但說俱有、相應得士用果，非同類、遍行。	豈不同類、遍行二因無間所生亦士用果，然等流果二因無間所生諸法，或是或非一切決定名士用果，何故但說俱有、相應得士用果，非同類、遍行。	018	Aren't the two fruits of dissimilarity and universal cause also the fruit of human effort produced immediately after? However, all dharmas produced immediately after the two causes of similarity and universal cause are either or not called the fruit of human effort. Why is it said that only co-existent and associated causes obtain the fruit of human effort, not the similar and universal causes?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a19_12']	唯此二因具足能得俱生、無間二士用果，非前二因，是故不說。	唯此二因具足能得俱生、無間二士用果，非前二因，是故不說。	018	Only these two causes are fully able to obtain the two fruits of human effort that arise simultaneously and immediately after, not the first two causes. Therefore, they are not mentioned.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a20_20']	成等流果唯似自因，同類、遍行果唯相似，故彼二果唯名等流；	成等流果唯似自因，同類、遍行果唯相似，故彼二果唯名等流；	018	The fruit of similarity is only similar to its own cause, and the fruit of similarity and universal cause is only similar. Therefore, those two fruits are only called similarity.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a21_9']	餘非等流，非二因得。	餘非等流，非二因得。	018	The other fruits are not similarity, because they are not obtained by the two causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a22_17']	又士用果，俱者義強，俱有、相應獨能獲得俱士用果，是故偏說。	又士用果，俱者義強，俱有、相應獨能獲得俱士用果，是故偏說。	018	Moreover, the fruit of human effort is stronger in the simultaneous cause. Only the co-existent and associated causes are able to obtain the simultaneous fruit of human effort. Therefore, it is said in a biased way.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a25_4']	又同類因雖亦能得所生無間諸士用果，而非一切皆能定得，以阿羅漢最後諸蘊無無間生士用果故。	又同類因雖亦能得所生無間諸士用果，而非一切皆能定得，以阿羅漢最後諸蘊無無間生士用果故。	018	Also, although homogeneous causes can obtain the immediately antecedent karmic result of the activity of the person, not all can definitely obtain it, because the final aggregates of an arhat do not have the karmic result of the activity of the person that arises immediately after them.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a26_3']	俱有、相應二因決定得士用果，是故偏說。	俱有、相應二因決定得士用果，是故偏說。	018	The two causes of co-existence and association definitely obtain the karmic result of the activity of the person, and therefore they are mentioned specifically.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a26_8']	有餘師言：	有餘師言：	018	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a28_1']	能作因等亦有能得士用果義，非異熟因，俱生、無間二士用果此所無故。	能作因等亦有能得士用果義，非異熟因，俱生、無間二士用果此所無故。	018	The productive cause, etc., also have the meaning of being able to obtain the karmic result of the activity of the person. It is not the cause of maturation, because the two karmic results of the activity of the person that arise simultaneously and immediately after it do not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a28_6']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	018	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436a29_8']	此異熟因亦有隔越遠士用果，譬如農夫所收果實。	此異熟因亦有隔越遠士用果，譬如農夫所收果實。	018	This cause of maturation also has the distant karmic result of the activity of the person, just as the fruits reaped by a farmer.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b01_7']	已辯因果相對決定，今當正辯果相差別。	已辯因果相對決定，今當正辯果相差別。	018	The definite relationship between causes and effects has already been discussed. Now we will correctly discuss the distinctions in the characteristics of effects.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b01_16']	異熟等果其相云何？	異熟等果其相云何？	018	What are the characteristics of the effects such as maturation, etc.?

['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b03_0']	異熟無記法，　　有情有記生，	異熟無記法，　　有情有記生，	018	Maturation is a neutral dharma, produced by sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b04_0']	等流似自因，　　離繫由慧盡，	等流似自因，　　離繫由慧盡，	018	The outflow is similar to its own cause. The unfettered is the exhaustion by wisdom.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b05_0']	若因彼力生，　　是果名士用，	若因彼力生，　　是果名士用，	018	If a result arises due to the power of a cause, it is called the result of human effort.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b06_13']	除前有為法，　　有為增上果。	除前有為法，　　有為增上果。	018	Except for the above, conditioned dharmas are the dominant results of conditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b07_2']	論曰：	論曰：	018	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b07_15']	唯於無覆無記法中有異熟果。	唯於無覆無記法中有異熟果。	018	Only in the case of unobstructed indeterminate dharmas is there a retribution result.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b08_9']	若爾，則應非有情數亦是異熟。	若爾，則應非有情數亦是異熟。	018	If that is so, then what is not associated with sentient beings should also be retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b09_8']	為欲簡彼說有情言，唯於有情有異熟故。	為欲簡彼說有情言，唯於有情有異熟故。	018	In order to distinguish that, the text says associated with sentient beings. Because only what is associated with sentient beings has retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b10_8']	若爾，於彼有情數中，長養、等流應是異熟。	若爾，於彼有情數中，長養、等流應是異熟。	018	If that is so, then among what is associated with sentient beings, the nourished and the outflow result should be retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b12_5']	又為簡彼，說有記生，一切不善及善有漏能記異熟，故名有記，從彼後時異熟方起；	又為簡彼，說有記生，一切不善及善有漏能記異熟，故名有記，從彼後時異熟方起；	018	Also, in order to distinguish that, the text says arisen from what is capable of being a cause of retribution. All that is unwholesome and all that is wholesome and contaminated can cause retribution, and therefore it is called capable of being a cause of retribution. Retribution arises later from that.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b12_14']	非俱無間名有記生。	非俱無間名有記生。	018	It is not called capable of being a cause of retribution if it arises simultaneously or immediately after.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b13_4']	如是名為異熟果相。	如是名為異熟果相。	018	This is called the characteristic of the retribution result.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b15_15']	豈不異熟亦以前位異熟果體為同類因，是前異熟等流果故，則應亦說從無記生是等流性，如何乃說從有記生？	豈不異熟亦以前位異熟果體為同類因，是前異熟等流果故，則應亦說從無記生是等流性，如何乃說從有記生？	018	Is it not the case that the prior substance of retribution is the homogeneous cause of the subsequent stage of retribution, because it is the similar cause of the prior retribution? Then it should also be said that it arises from the indeterminate, because it is a similar cause. How is it said that it arises from the determinate?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b16_6']	非等流性，無如是失。	非等流性，無如是失。	018	There is no such fault in the case of the similar cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b17_19']	異熟果體由同類因相有雜亂，由異熟因相無雜亂，是故但說從有記生。	異熟果體由同類因相有雜亂，由異熟因相無雜亂，是故但說從有記生。	018	The substance of retribution is confused in its characteristics as a homogeneous cause, but the characteristics of the cause of retribution are not confused. Therefore it is said that it arises only from the determinate.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b19_3']	由此准知，非等流性以等流果與因相似有雜亂故。	由此准知，非等流性以等流果與因相似有雜亂故。	018	From this, it is understood that the similar cause is not a similar result, because the similar result is confused with the cause in its characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b20_15']	若異熟果與因相殊無雜亂故，非有情數亦從業生，何故不說為異熟果？	若異熟果與因相殊無雜亂故，非有情數亦從業生，何故不說為異熟果？	018	If the result of retribution is not confused with the cause in its characteristics, and because it arises from action, why is it not said that the result of retribution of that which is not a sentient being also arises from action?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b21_14']	此不應難，唯不共業所得之果名異熟故。	此不應難，唯不共業所得之果名異熟故。	018	This should not be criticized, because the result obtained by action that is not shared is called retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b21_17']	何故？	何故？	018	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b23_3']	非情非唯不共業所得果，以非情法餘可於中共受用故。	非情非唯不共業所得果，以非情法餘可於中共受用故。	018	That which is not a sentient being is not only the result obtained by action that is not shared, because other sentient beings can experience together the results of dharmas that are not sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b24_11']	豈不大梵所住非情是別業果，亦應說彼名業異熟，何乃言非？	豈不大梵所住非情是別業果，亦應說彼名業異熟，何乃言非？	018	Is it not the case that the abode of the great Brahma is not a result of the karma of a single being, and should it not be said that it is the result of the karma of many beings? Why do you say that it is not?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b24_16']	有作是言：	有作是言：	018	There is an opinion that

['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b27_12']	如何一物，無量有情業所共感？	如何一物，無量有情業所共感？	018	How can one thing be the result of the common karma of innumerable beings?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b28_6']	豈不已說餘可於中共受用故。	豈不已說餘可於中共受用故。	018	Haven’t we already said that it is because others can enjoy it?
['ZH_T29_1562_018:0436b29_5']	若非情果不共業招，應隨異熟俱時起盡。	若非情果不共業招，應隨異熟俱時起盡。	018	If the result of non-common karma is not attracted by common karma, it should perish when the retribution is exhausted.
