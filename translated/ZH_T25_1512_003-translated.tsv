['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a04_0', 'ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a05_0']	自此以下，尊者須菩提生疑致問。🔽「須菩提白佛言：頗有眾生，未來世於此脩多	自此以下，尊者須菩提生疑致問。 「須菩提白佛言：頗有眾生，未來世於此脩多	003	From here below, Venerable Subhūti gives rise to doubts and asks questions.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a08_2']	羅生實相」等者，自此以下有二段經，是大段第六，名為我空法空分也，此亦名住放辨才段。	羅生實相」等者，自此以下有二段經，是大段第六，名為我空法空分也，此亦名住放辨才段。	003	Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: Are there sentient beings who, in the future world, will give rise to the true characteristics of this sūtra... and so forth. From here below there are two sections of sūtra. This is the sixth major section, named the section on the emptiness of self and the emptiness of dharmas. This is also called the section on abiding in eloquence.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a09_8']	所以名我空法空者，就對計我四句，明無我四句以釋我空。	所以名我空法空者，就對計我四句，明無我四句以釋我空。	003	The reason it is called the emptiness of self and the emptiness of dharmas is that, in relation to the four propositions of the self, it clarifies the four propositions of non-self in order to explain the emptiness of self.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a11_18']	明能信菩薩，於眾生五陰中，解從本以來無定實神我、眾生、壽命等四以之為我，又無定實五陰因緣以為我所。	明能信菩薩，於眾生五陰中，解從本以來無定實神我、眾生、壽命等四以之為我，又無定實五陰因緣以為我所。	003	It clarifies that the bodhisattvas who are able to believe, within the five aggregates of sentient beings, understand that from the beginning there is no definite real divine self, sentient beings, life, and so forth, which are taken as the self, and also no definite real five aggregates and conditions taken as the self's possessions.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a12_16']	以不見定性我所可以除蕩，故名我空。	以不見定性我所可以除蕩，故名我空。	003	Since they do not see any definite nature of self and possessions that can be eliminated, it is called the emptiness of self.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a13_13']	法空者，就對法中四句以明法空。	法空者，就對法中四句以明法空。	003	As for the emptiness of dharmas, in relation to the four propositions within dharmas, it clarifies the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a15_2']	上我空，直見生陰定性我無定性，所猶未空生陰因緣法體。	上我空，直見生陰定性我無定性，所猶未空生陰因緣法體。	003	Above, it is said that the self is empty, directly seeing that the nature of the self in the aggregates is indeterminate, but the aggregates as the causes and conditions of arising are still not empty.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a17_3']	今明此生陰非直無有定實神我，其體生滅因緣虛妄，本來寂靜乃至假名亦無，故名法空。	今明此生陰非直無有定實神我，其體生滅因緣虛妄，本來寂靜乃至假名亦無，故名法空。	003	Now, it is explained that these aggregates not only have no definite real self, but their arising and ceasing are illusory due to causes and conditions, originally quiescent, and even the provisional name is also non-existent, thus called the emptiness of phenomena.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a18_5']	又知佛性真如古今一定體無方相，亦名法空也。	又知佛性真如古今一定體無方相，亦名法空也。	003	Moreover, it is known that the essence of buddha-nature is true suchness, ancient and present, definitely one, with no fixed characteristics, also called the emptiness of phenomena.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a22_3']	亦名任放辨才段，所以名任放辨才者，明諸佛菩薩得不妄陀羅尼自在辨才，故能隨問而答超越解釋，前後任意義不相違，故曰任放辨才。	亦名任放辨才段，所以名任放辨才者，明諸佛菩薩得不妄陀羅尼自在辨才，故能隨問而答超越解釋，前後任意義不相違，故曰任放辨才。	003	It is also called the section on unrestrained eloquence. The reason it is called unrestrained eloquence is because it clarifies that buddhas and bodhisattvas attain the unobstructed dhāraṇī and sovereign eloquence, thus able to answer according to questions and explain in a transcendent manner, with the meaning not contradictory before and after, thus called unrestrained eloquence.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a23_4']	就此段中有任放辨才義故，名任放辨才段也。	就此段中有任放辨才義故，名任放辨才段也。	003	In this section, there is the meaning of unrestrained eloquence, thus it is called the section on unrestrained eloquence.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a25_5']	亦得名有能信者分，以此段中明三種人能信此經故也。	亦得名有能信者分，以此段中明三種人能信此經故也。	003	It can also be called the section on those who are able to believe, because in this section it clarifies that three kinds of people are able to believe in this sūtra.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a25_13']	此經以何次第起？	此經以何次第起？	003	In what sequence does this sutra arise?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a26_13']	上第四段中，明不住相行於布施，說因深義。	上第四段中，明不住相行於布施，說因深義。	003	In the fourth section above, it clarifies the practice of giving without abiding in characteristics, explaining the profound meaning of the cause.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a27_11']	第五段中，辨如來非有為相，說果深義。	第五段中，辨如來非有為相，說果深義。	003	In the fifth section, it distinguishes the Tathāgata as not having the characteristics of conditioned arising, explaining the profound meaning of the result.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a27_16']	有人生疑：	有人生疑：	003	Some people give rise to doubts:
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812a29_2']	如來說法非直為利現坐大眾，乃亦被益未來像法眾生。	如來說法非直為利現坐大眾，乃亦被益未來像法眾生。	003	The Tathāgata's teaching of the Dharma is not only for the benefit of the great assembly presently seated, but also for the benefit of sentient beings in the semblance Dharma in the future.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b03_8']	然現坐大眾親覩如來，復是久行大士，善根淳厚智慧深妙，是人於此深經可容生信，未來世眾生善根微薄智慧尠少，於此因果深經不能生信。	然現坐大眾親覩如來，復是久行大士，善根淳厚智慧深妙，是人於此深經可容生信，未來世眾生善根微薄智慧尠少，於此因果深經不能生信。	003	However, the great assembly presently seated personally beholds the Tathāgata, and they are also great beings of long practice, with pure and thick wholesome roots and profound and wondrous wisdom. These people may be able to give rise to faith in this profound sūtra, but sentient beings in the future world with meager wholesome roots and scant wisdom will be unable to give rise to faith in this profound sūtra on cause and effect.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b04_13']	若爾，則為如來空說無益，云何如來得言不空說法也？	若爾，則為如來空說無益，云何如來得言不空說法也？	003	If that is so, then it would be as if the Tathāgata spoke in vain without benefit. How can the Tathāgata be said to speak the Dharma without being in vain?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b05_8']	若空說無益，如來則非一切智人。	若空說無益，如來則非一切智人。	003	If speaking in vain without benefit, the Tathāgata would not be a person of omniscience.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b07_1']	如是因果二種甚深修多羅，未來末世為當有人能信、為無人能信也？	如是因果二種甚深修多羅，未來末世為當有人能信、為無人能信也？	003	Such profound causes and effects of the sutra, in the future final age, will there be people who can believe it, or will there be no one who can believe it?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b07_7']	有如此疑故。	有如此疑故。	003	Because there is such doubt,
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b08_1']	須菩提騰大眾疑意，故白佛言：	須菩提騰大眾疑意，故白佛言：	003	Subhuti conveys the doubts of the great assembly, and therefore addresses the Buddha, saying:
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b09_8']	於如來滅後惡世之中，頗有眾生能信此經以之為實相不也。	於如來滅後惡世之中，頗有眾生能信此經以之為實相不也。	003	After the Tathagata's extinction, in the evil age, will there be any sentient beings who can believe in this sutra and take it as the true aspect?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b09_12']	佛下答：	佛下答：	003	The Buddha answers below:
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b11_11']	有人能信，明於未來惡世有持戒、修福德、智慧者三人，能信此經生於實相，故次明也。	有人能信，明於未來惡世有持戒、修福德、智慧者三人，能信此經生於實相，故次明也。	003	There are people who can believe it. It clarifies that in the evil age of the future, there are three kinds of people who uphold precepts, cultivate merit and virtue, and have wisdom. They can believe in this sutra and give rise to the true aspect, and therefore it is explained next.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b12_2']	應問：	應問：	003	It should be asked:
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b13_7']	能信之人乃有其三，何故單以我法二空㯹第六段名者？	能信之人乃有其三，何故單以我法二空㯹第六段名者？	003	There are three kinds of people who can believe it. Why is it named only after the two emptinesses of self and dharmas in the sixth section?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b14_13']	明持戒、修福德二人，在於地前，仰習二空，聞中生信；	明持戒、修福德二人，在於地前，仰習二空，聞中生信；	003	It clarifies that the two kinds of people who uphold precepts and cultivate merit and virtue are in the stage before the grounds. They look up to the two emptinesses and give rise to faith upon hearing them.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b15_16']	有智慧人，乃是初地以上，現見我法二空，證中生信。	有智慧人，乃是初地以上，現見我法二空，證中生信。	003	Those with wisdom are those on the first ground and above, who directly perceive the emptiness of both self and dharmas, and give rise to faith in the truth.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b17_10']	然前之二人雖未現證，以其亦同觀二空，髣髴見理，故俱列為能信之人。	然前之二人雖未現證，以其亦同觀二空，髣髴見理，故俱列為能信之人。	003	However, although the first two types of people have not yet directly realized it, since they also contemplate the emptiness of both self and dharmas, they dimly perceive the truth, and are therefore both listed as those who can give rise to faith.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b19_3']	今明雖有三人能信，但逐三人所觀勝境為名，故曰我空法空分也。	今明雖有三人能信，但逐三人所觀勝境為名，故曰我空法空分也。	003	Now, although there are three types of people who can give rise to faith, we follow the superior objects contemplated by the three types of people in naming them, and thus speak of the division into the emptiness of self and the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b21_10']	然今將欲道有人能信，故先遮言莫作是說，明未來惡世中有人能信此經，不應問言頗有人能生信不也。	然今將欲道有人能信，故先遮言莫作是說，明未來惡世中有人能信此經，不應問言頗有人能生信不也。	003	Now, since we are about to speak of people who can give rise to faith, we first block [Subhūti's question] by saying do not speak thus, clarifying that in the evil world of the future there are people who can give rise to faith in this sūtra, and we should not ask whether there are people who can give rise to faith.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b22_18']	須菩提既聞如來遮言莫作是說，即復生疑：	須菩提既聞如來遮言莫作是說，即復生疑：	003	When Subhūti heard the Tathāgata block [his question] by saying do not speak thus, he immediately gave rise to doubt:
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b24_2']	我今不解佛意，為當一向無人能信，直止我令默？	我今不解佛意，為當一向無人能信，直止我令默？	003	I do not understand the Buddha's meaning now. Should I simply say that there are no people who can give rise to faith, and thus be stopped from speaking?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b24_15']	為有人能信而止我令諦聽也？	為有人能信而止我令諦聽也？	003	Or are there people who can give rise to faith, and I am stopped from speaking so that I should listen carefully?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b25_12']	故佛答有言，有者明有人能信也。	故佛答有言，有者明有人能信也。	003	Therefore, the Buddha's answer says there are to clarify that there are people who can have faith.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b27_2']	雖云有人能信，未知何等人能信故，即云未來世有菩薩能信。	雖云有人能信，未知何等人能信故，即云未來世有菩薩能信。	003	Although it is said that there are people who can have faith, it is not yet known what kind of people can have faith, so it is said that in the future there will be bodhisattvas who can have faith.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b28_4']	又此菩薩有何等德行、觀何境界，故能信此經也？	又此菩薩有何等德行、觀何境界，故能信此經也？	003	Moreover, what kind of virtues and practices does this bodhisattva have, and what realm does he contemplate, that he can have faith in this sutra?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812b29_10']	故次云有持戒、修福德、智慧也，此總明三種人有能信之德。	故次云有持戒、修福德、智慧也，此總明三種人有能信之德。	003	Therefore, it is said next that there are those who uphold precepts, cultivate merit and virtue, and have wisdom. This generally clarifies that there are three kinds of people who have the virtue of being able to have faith.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c05_2']	所以名「持戒」者，明此人已久供諸佛，曾聞此《金剛般若》及以餘大乘經，於中生信受持讀誦如說修行，知一切眾生皆有佛性，發菩提心、慎教修行者，乃名真實究竟持戒，非唯持律儀戒者為持戒也。	所以名「持戒」者，明此人已久供諸佛，曾聞此《金剛般若》及以餘大乘經，於中生信受持讀誦如說修行，知一切眾生皆有佛性，發菩提心、慎教修行者，乃名真實究竟持戒，非唯持律儀戒者為持戒也。	003	The reason it is called upholding precepts is to clarify that this person has long made offerings to the buddhas, has heard this Diamond Prajñāpāramitā and other Mahāyāna sūtras, has given rise to faith in them, upheld them, read them, recited them, practiced in accordance with them, knows that all sentient beings have buddha-nature, has given rise to the bodhi mind, and carefully teaches and practices, which is then called the true and ultimate upholding of precepts. It is not only those who uphold the precepts of the vinaya who are upholding the precepts.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c06_13']	「福德」者，明此菩薩於諸佛所，廣以珍財奉施，修波羅蜜行，名福德也。	「福德」者，明此菩薩於諸佛所，廣以珍財奉施，修波羅蜜行，名福德也。	003	Merit refers to this bodhisattva who, in the presence of the buddhas, extensively makes offerings of precious wealth and cultivates the practices of the perfections, which is called merit.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c07_7']	此之二人，在於地前，聞中仰信。	此之二人，在於地前，聞中仰信。	003	These two people, while still on the grounds prior to [the ten] stages, hear and believe in the middle [ground].
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c09_2']	「智慧」者，明此人已僧祇行滿，道登初地，現見我法二空，自證而信，名有智慧也。	「智慧」者，明此人已僧祇行滿，道登初地，現見我法二空，自證而信，名有智慧也。	003	Wisdom refers to this person who has fulfilled the practices for eons, ascended to the first stage, directly sees the emptiness of both self and dharmas, and believes through their own realization, which is called having wisdom.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c09_17']	明此三人於斯經能生實相之信也。	明此三人於斯經能生實相之信也。	003	It clarifies that these three people are able to give rise to the faith of true characteristics in this sūtra.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c13_6']	此言「實相」者，明彼三種人，能信上不取相行是無相之因實能感無為法法身，亦信無為法身是無相之果真實不虛，能生實相之解，故言以此為實也。	此言「實相」者，明彼三種人，能信上不取相行是無相之因實能感無為法法身，亦信無為法身是無相之果真實不虛，能生實相之解，故言以此為實也。	003	As for this mention of true characteristics, it clarifies that those three types of people are able to believe that the practice of non-grasping of characteristics above is the cause of signlessness that is truly able to elicit the unconditioned dharma of the Dharma body, and also believe that the unconditioned Dharma body is the true and not false result of signlessness. They are able to give rise to the understanding of true characteristics, and therefore it is said that they take this as true.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c15_4']	然上雖總出三人能信之德，明前二種人在於地前聞中生信，有智慧人地上證信。	然上雖總出三人能信之德，明前二種人在於地前聞中生信，有智慧人地上證信。	003	Although the above generally presents the virtues of the three types of people who are able to believe, it clarifies that the first two types of people give rise to belief while listening at the stage before the grounds, while the wise person gives rise to belief based on realization at the stage of the grounds.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c17_9']	然此前二人若在地前，此人為曾供養諸佛、發菩提心已修行未故信，為當未修行來而能信此經也？	然此前二人若在地前，此人為曾供養諸佛、發菩提心已修行未故信，為當未修行來而能信此經也？	003	However, if these first two people are at the stage before the grounds, have they already made offerings to the buddhas, given rise to the bodhi mind, and practiced for a long time, and thus have faith, or are they able to have faith in this sūtra without having practiced for a long time?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c18_12']	若曾供養諸佛、久修行來者、為當供養幾許佛來也？	若曾供養諸佛、久修行來者、為當供養幾許佛來也？	003	If they have already made offerings to the buddhas and practiced for a long time, how many buddhas have they made offerings to?
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c20_5']	故佛告須菩提，當知彼菩薩非於一佛二三四五佛所供養種善根來也。	故佛告須菩提，當知彼菩薩非於一佛二三四五佛所供養種善根來也。	003	Therefore, the Buddha told Subhūti, You should know that those bodhisattvas have not made offerings and planted good roots with one, two, three, four, or five buddhas.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c21_11']	然就三人之中，先別明前二人非近修行來具能信之德也。	然就三人之中，先別明前二人非近修行來具能信之德也。	003	Among the three types of people, first it specifically clarifies that the first two are not able to have the virtue of faith by practicing for a short time.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c23_15']	此經正直爾汎明斯二人能信之德，不可定指在習種性、性種、道種性中，以其義通上下故也。	此經正直爾汎明斯二人能信之德，不可定指在習種性、性種、道種性中，以其義通上下故也。	003	This sutra straightforwardly and generally clarifies the virtues of faith in these two people. It cannot be definitively pointed out as being within the nature of the stage of practice, the stage of nature, or the stage of the path, because its meaning is common to both higher and lower [stages].
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c26_13']	「一二三四五佛所修供養」者，此別出持戒人，明彼菩薩能信此經，如此經如說修行稱可聖心，名為第一供養，非謂香華等為供養也。	「一二三四五佛所修供養」者，此別出持戒人，明彼菩薩能信此經，如此經如說修行稱可聖心，名為第一供養，非謂香華等為供養也。	003	Cultivating offerings to one, two, three, four, or five Buddhas refers to those who uphold the precepts. It clarifies that those bodhisattvas are able to have faith in this sutra. Practicing this sutra as it is taught and being in accord with the holy mind is called the foremost offering, not referring to offerings such as incense and flowers.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0812c28_18']	又「非一二三四五佛所種善根」者，廣以衣服珍寶財物等奉施諸佛，修波羅蜜行，名為有福德人也。	又「非一二三四五佛所種善根」者，廣以衣服珍寶財物等奉施諸佛，修波羅蜜行，名為有福德人也。	003	Not having planted good roots under one, two, three, four, or five Buddhas means extensively offering clothing, precious treasures, wealth, and other things to the Buddhas, and cultivating the practices of the perfections, which is called being a person with merit and virtue.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0813a02_2']	「於無量諸佛所，修行供養種善根」者，直云非一二三四五佛所修行供養種善根，未知幾許佛所？	「於無量諸佛所，修行供養種善根」者，直云非一二三四五佛所修行供養種善根，未知幾許佛所？	003	Cultivating offerings and planting good roots under immeasurable Buddhas simply says not having cultivated offerings and planted good roots under one, two, three, four, or five Buddhas, but it is not known how many Buddhas [it refers to].
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0813a04_7']	今者明此人已於無量百千萬乃至不可說不可說諸佛所，持戒修福德來，非是近行之人能生信也。	今者明此人已於無量百千萬乃至不可說不可說諸佛所，持戒修福德來，非是近行之人能生信也。	003	Now it is explained that this person has upheld the precepts and cultivated merit and virtue for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of kalpas, up to inexpressibly inexpressible numbers of buddhas, and is not a person of recent practice who can give rise to faith.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0813a06_4']	「乃至一念能生淨信」者，此並明二人久供養諸佛殖因來遠，於此深經能生信心。	「乃至一念能生淨信」者，此並明二人久供養諸佛殖因來遠，於此深經能生信心。	003	Up to being able to give rise to pure faith in a single thought - this clarifies that these two people have made offerings to buddhas for a long time and have planted causes from afar, and are able to give rise to faith in this profound sutra.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0813a06_17']	此是聞中髣髴信，非證信也。	此是聞中髣髴信，非證信也。	003	This is a semblance of faith through hearing, not faith through realization.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0813a08_4']	然此一念信決定不退，無有疑濁，尚得名為淨信，況多時也。	然此一念信決定不退，無有疑濁，尚得名為淨信，況多時也。	003	However, this single thought of faith is determined to be irreversible, without doubt or turbidity, and is still called pure faith, let alone for a long time.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0813a09_13']	上如來雖答此二種人曾供諸佛能信此經，然大眾猶有疑心言：	上如來雖答此二種人曾供諸佛能信此經，然大眾猶有疑心言：	003	Above, although the Tathāgata has answered that these two kinds of people have made offerings to buddhas and are able to believe in this sutra, the great assembly still has doubts and say:

It clarifies that although the Dharma realized in suchness has no name or characteristics to be spoken, it is not that one does not seek this name and characteristics, the teachings, to understand the principle of suchness, which is without name or characteristics. It clarifies that because one realizes this suchness, which is unconditioned, one still speaks of the unconditioned Dharma, which is also not without characteristics.

Now this fourth clarifies that the essence of suchness transcends words and other conditioned myriad characteristics, but because one understands the principle through interpretation and because there is speech based on realization, the principle of the mutual correspondence between the root and branches is not distinct. Therefore, it can be said that within the Dharma realized in suchness, there are names, words, and teachings that can be spoken. This is the difference.

Perhaps someone hears the explanation of the fourth phrase in the Dharma-emptiness, saying that although true suchness is without names and characteristics, it is not that the Dharma to be realized does not exist due to this true suchness, and that these sounds and spoken teachings still expound the wisdom of realization, and further rely on these spoken teachings to attain that wisdom of realization.

It clarifies that although the bodhisattvas of the first ground attain the understanding of the emptiness of self and dharmas, they only eliminate the one type of coarse affliction to be eliminated in the first ground, but still have the subtle discriminating mind and the afflictions of effort in the ground of wholesome dharmas of the four abodes of ignorance above the second ground, and thus it is said that they will then be attached to self, person, and so forth, and it does not mean that they still have the coarse afflictions of the four abodes and grasp at the Dharma to be realized with names and characteristics.

['ZH_T25_1512_003:0817a26_18']	雖不同第三證而生信，亦能於經生決定解，故超舉上淨信經來結也。	雖不同第三證而生信，亦能於經生決定解，故超舉上淨信經來結也。	003	Although they are not the same as the third person who gives rise to faith through realization, they are also able to give rise to definitive understanding of the sūtra, and therefore the sūtra on pure faith is brought up to conclude.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0817a28_14']	「又有智慧」以下，釋下半偈，明第三智慧人，不如聲取證，現中生信，勝於前二。	「又有智慧」以下，釋下半偈，明第三智慧人，不如聲取證，現中生信，勝於前二。	003	And furthermore, there is wisdom, below this explains the second half of the verse, clarifying that the third person of wisdom does not take realization as the sound, and gives rise to faith in the present, surpassing the previous two.

He then uses the doubts of others to answer their doubts, clarifying the prohibition against slander, thus saying the Buddha of Retribution has realization and speaking, but it is not discussed that the Buddha of Response has realization and speaking.

From here below, in order to explain the sūtra passages not included in the verses, it first asks about the sūtra above, saying: If it is said that there is teaching based on suchness, why is it only said that it is the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata, and not said to be the Dharma realized by the Tathāgata?

It concludes by saying, Because the name is obtained based on the unconditioned dharma.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0820a10_5']	「以此義故」者，以此聖人無為法得名義故，彼聖人還說無為法，是故得成證法是言說因也。	「以此義故」者，以此聖人無為法得名義故，彼聖人還說無為法，是故得成證法是言說因也。	003	For this reason means that for this reason of the sages obtaining their names based on the unconditioned dharma, those sages still speak of the unconditioned dharma, and therefore it is established that the realized dharma is the cause of speech.

['ZH_T25_1512_003:0820a16_17']	即答云「彼聖人所證法，不可如是說，何況如是取」，明彼證法體非聲性故，尚不可以言說，何況以耳識往取，故云不可如是說，何況如是取也。	即答云「彼聖人所證法，不可如是說，何況如是取」，明彼證法體非聲性故，尚不可以言說，何況以耳識往取，故云不可如是說，何況如是取也。	003	The answer is: The dharma realized by the sages cannot be spoken of in this way, let alone grasped in this way. This clarifies that the essence of the realized dharma is not of the nature of sound, and can only be spoken of by words, let alone being grasped by the ear consciousness. Therefore, it says cannot be spoken of in this way, let alone grasped in this way.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0820a17_8']	故即釋言「何以故？	故即釋言「何以故？	003	Therefore, it is explained: Why is it so?

This clarifies that although the sages realize the unconditioned dharmas and then speak of the unconditioned dharmas, because this unconditioned dharma is apart from language, it cannot be grasped or spoken of.

Why then do you say that all sages are named based on the unconditioned dharma? He then answers, Because all sages are named based on the purity of suchness, clarifying that sages from the first ground and above all directly see suchness in the same way, and are therefore called sages. Therefore, it is not only the Buddha who is spoken of.

Therefore, the Buddha is called a holy person of complete purity.
['ZH_T25_1512_003:0820b05_12']	初地以上十地以還，雖復見勝理未圓、斷惑不盡，非不如分如力見理除惑，勝分解成故，名菩薩為聖人，如分清淨也。	初地以上十地以還，雖復見勝理未圓、斷惑不盡，非不如分如力見理除惑，勝分解成故，名菩薩為聖人，如分清淨也。	003	From the first ground up to the tenth ground, although he has insight into the superior principle and has not yet perfected the elimination of afflictions, it is not that he does not see the principle according to his ability and eliminate afflictions. Because the superior part is perfected, the bodhisattva is called a holy person of thus partial purity.
