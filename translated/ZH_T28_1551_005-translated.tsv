['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858a17_19']	六卷成部定品之二別譯已說功德自性，亦說有漏無漏，成就今當說。	六卷成部定品之二別譯已說功德自性，亦說有漏無漏，成就今當說。	The chapter on concentration, part 2, is completed in six scrolls. The nature of merits has been explained, and also whether they are contaminated or uncontaminated. The attainment will now be explained.

['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858a21_10']	當知未離欲成就味相應者，若人若此地未離欲，成就此地味相應。	當知未離欲成就味相應者，若人若此地未離欲，成就此地味相應。	It should be known that one who has not yet abandoned desire attains the flavor-associated [concentration] means that if a person has not yet abandoned desire for a certain realm, they attain the flavor-associated [concentration] of that realm.
['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858a24_1']	離下未至上成就淨諸定者，離欲界欲未生第二禪等中梵世，若離欲若不離欲，成就淨初禪及彼地餘善功德。	離下未至上成就淨諸定者，離欲界欲未生第二禪等中梵世，若離欲若不離欲，成就淨初禪及彼地餘善功德。	Having abandoned the lower [realms] but not yet reaching the higher, one attains the pure concentrations means that having abandoned desire for the desire realm but not yet giving rise to the second concentration and above, whether one has abandoned desire or not, one attains the pure first concentration and the other wholesome qualities of that realm.
['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858a25_0']	住上應當知，　　成就下無漏，	住上應當知，　　成就下無漏，	It should be known that abiding in the higher, one attains the lower uncontaminated [concentration].

['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858a29_3']	住上應當知成就下無漏者，聖人生梵世上，成就無漏初禪及餘無漏三昧神通及智等諸功德。	住上應當知成就下無漏者，聖人生梵世上，成就無漏初禪及餘無漏三昧神通及智等諸功德。	As for the statement that one abiding in a higher stage should be known as accomplishing the lower undefiled [attainments], when an arhat is born in the Brahma world and above, he accomplishes the undefiled first dhyāna and other undefiled samādhis, supernormal powers, and various merits such as knowledge.
['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858b01_10']	彼地有漏功德生處縛，無漏斷縛，是故離生處捨有漏非無漏。	彼地有漏功德生處縛，無漏斷縛，是故離生處捨有漏非無漏。	The defiled merits of that stage are bound by the place of birth, and the undefiled [attainments] sever the bonds. Therefore, one abandons the defiled [attainments] upon leaving the place of birth, but not the undefiled [attainments].
['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858b02_2']	如是一切地隨其義說。	如是一切地隨其義說。	In this way, all stages should be explained according to their meaning.

['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858b04_11']	方便現在前者，彼非離欲。	方便現在前者，彼非離欲。	As for those born of skillful means that are presently manifested, they are not apart from desire.
['ZH_T28_1551_005:0858b06_17']	方便得者，如天眼耳，彼無記故，無漏、淨、味相應不攝，是故得彼三種禪時不得滅盡，是滅盡定者方便故。	方便得者，如天眼耳，彼無記故，無漏、淨、味相應不攝，是故得彼三種禪時不得滅盡，是滅盡定者方便故。	As for those attained through skillful means, such as the divine eye and ear, since they are indeterminate, they are not included in the undefiled, pure, or associated with enjoyment. Therefore, when one attains those three dhyānas, one does not attain the cessation of ideation and feeling. This cessation of ideation and feeling is attained through skillful means.
