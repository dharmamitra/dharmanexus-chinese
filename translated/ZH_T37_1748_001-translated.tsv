['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c08_2']	三門：	三門：	001	three points:
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c08_17']	一者來意、二者釋名、三解本文。	一者來意、二者釋名、三解本文。	001	First, the reason for the composition; second, explaining the title; third, interpreting the main text.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c09_6']	初、來意者，略有三義：	初、來意者，略有三義：	001	First, the reason for the composition has three main points:
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c09_17']	一者欲顯淨土之所因故。	一者欲顯淨土之所因故。	001	First, it is to reveal the causes of the Pure Land.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c13_3']	謂前經中雖言華座由法藏比丘願力所成，而猶未說極樂依正二報莊嚴皆依法積本誓力成，故今更須廣說宿世四十八願，以顯彼土今現之因。	謂前經中雖言華座由法藏比丘願力所成，而猶未說極樂依正二報莊嚴皆依法積本誓力成，故今更須廣說宿世四十八願，以顯彼土今現之因。	001	That is to say, although the previous sutra mentions that the flower seat is formed by the power of Dharmakara Bodhisattva's vows, it still has not explained that the adornments of the two aspects of the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss are all based on the power of Dharmakara's original vows. Therefore, it is now necessary to extensively explain the forty-eight vows made in the past in order to reveal the causes that have manifested the Pure Land in the present.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c13_14']	二者欲辨本誓之不虛故。	二者欲辨本誓之不虛故。	001	Second, it is to show that the original vows are not empty.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c15_7']	謂一切佛雖發本願，本願亦有不能果遂，如般若中所有眾生令得滅度。	謂一切佛雖發本願，本願亦有不能果遂，如般若中所有眾生令得滅度。	001	That is to say, although all Buddhas make original vows, the original vows may not be fulfilled, like the vow in the Prajnaparamita sutras to liberate all sentient beings.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c17_6']	法積願力即不如此，故今廣說依正功德嚴淨，以顯宿願必有所辨，使增行者往生之意。	法積願力即不如此，故今廣說依正功德嚴淨，以顯宿願必有所辨，使增行者往生之意。	001	The power of Dharma-accumulation's vows is not like this, so now it extensively explains the adornment and purification of the dependent and the independent, revealing that the previous vows will certainly accomplish something, causing practitioners to have the intention of being reborn.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c17_17']	三者欲示穢土之苦惱故。	三者欲示穢土之苦惱故。	001	Third, it is because it wants to show the suffering and distress of the defiled land.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c22_10']	謂觀經中雖言未來一切眾生為煩惱賊之所苦害，而眾生不聞痛惱之相即不能起欣厭之意往生之業亦不得成，故今廣宣五惡痛燒以於苦害，令修行者厭此苦域、欣彼樂方，修福觀行，速出娑婆而生淨土。	謂觀經中雖言未來一切眾生為煩惱賊之所苦害，而眾生不聞痛惱之相即不能起欣厭之意往生之業亦不得成，故今廣宣五惡痛燒以於苦害，令修行者厭此苦域、欣彼樂方，修福觀行，速出娑婆而生淨土。	001	Although the Guanjing says that all sentient beings in the future are harmed by the thief of afflictions, if sentient beings do not hear the characteristics of pain and distress, they will not be able to give rise to the intention of delight and disgust, and the karma of being reborn will also not be accomplished. Therefore, now it extensively proclaims the burning of the five evils and harm, causing practitioners to detest this suffering realm and delight in that blissful place, cultivate meritorious practices, quickly leave the Sahā world and be reborn in the Pure Land.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c23_4']	如其次第，即所成所化之二也。	如其次第，即所成所化之二也。	001	In sequence, these are the two of what is accomplished and what is transformed.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c23_21']	以是三義，故次《觀經》後說此經也。	以是三義，故次《觀經》後說此經也。	001	For these three reasons, this sūtra is explained after the Guanjing.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c25_15']	第二、釋名者，觀乎歷代傳來經本，經本題名雖復多途，今且申三代經之首名也。	第二、釋名者，觀乎歷代傳來經本，經本題名雖復多途，今且申三代經之首名也。	001	Second, in explaining the names, observing the scriptures transmitted through the ages, although the titles of the scriptures are numerous, I will now explain the names at the beginning of the scriptures of the three dynasties.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c26_14']	魏時帛延顯「無量清淨平等覺經」之號；	魏時帛延顯「無量清淨平等覺經」之號；	001	During the Wei dynasty, Bo Yan revealed the title Sutra of Immeasurable Pure and Equal Enlightenment;
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c28_9']	吳時支謙立「諸佛阿彌陀三耶三佛薩樓佛檀過度人道經」之稱，亦名大阿彌陀；	吳時支謙立「諸佛阿彌陀三耶三佛薩樓佛檀過度人道經」之稱，亦名大阿彌陀；	001	During the Wu dynasty, Zhi Qian established the name Sutra on Amitabha Buddha of the Three Sages Crossing Over the Human Realm, also called the Great Amitabha;
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c29_2']	今西晉法護名「無量壽經」。	今西晉法護名「無量壽經」。	001	Now, during the Western Jin dynasty, Dharmaraksa named it the Sutra on Immeasurable Life.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0131c29_16']	故經之名雖復廣略，其義大同。	故經之名雖復廣略，其義大同。	001	Therefore, although the names of the sutras are extensive or concise, their meanings are largely the same.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a01_9']	欲釋法護經本之名，即有四對：	欲釋法護經本之名，即有四對：	001	If we want to explain the name of Dharmaraksa's version of the sutra, there are four pairs:
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a02_10']	一、總別相對，即佛說及經名總，無量壽名別故；	一、總別相對，即佛說及經名總，無量壽名別故；	001	First, the general and specific pairs, namely, the Buddha's teachings and the sutra's name are general, while the name Immeasurable Life is specific;
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a03_6']	二、人法相對，即佛者人，餘名法故；	二、人法相對，即佛者人，餘名法故；	001	Second, the person and dharma pairs, namely, the Buddha is a person, while the rest of the names are dharmas;
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a04_8']	三、詮旨相對，即無量壽名旨，經者詮也，說兼二故；	三、詮旨相對，即無量壽名旨，經者詮也，說兼二故；	001	Third, in terms of the meaning and the text, the name Infinite Life is the meaning, and the sutra is the text that explains it, as it discusses both;
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a05_15']	四、首尾相對，即上者對下之言，下亦對上之詞，如次首尾故。	四、首尾相對，即上者對下之言，下亦對上之詞，如次首尾故。	001	Fourth, in terms of the beginning and end, the word above corresponds to the lower, and the lower also corresponds to the upper, as the beginning and end come in sequence.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a06_3']	委細之義如前釋。	委細之義如前釋。	001	The detailed meaning is as explained above.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a07_12']	經曰「我聞如是」者，述云：	經曰「我聞如是」者，述云：	001	The sutra says Thus have I heard. This is stated:

['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a09_3']	又有第二直申彌陀宿成佛剎本願樂果，以例眾生生之因果。	又有第二直申彌陀宿成佛剎本願樂果，以例眾生生之因果。	001	There is also a second explanation that directly presents Amitâbha's original vow to attain Buddhahood and the blissful fruit, using it as an analogy for the causes and effects of sentient beings being born there.

['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a20_7']	如來現相將顯聖教，所說法門應名目，如何乃言現相分耶？	如來現相將顯聖教，所說法門應名目，如何乃言現相分耶？	001	The Tathāgata manifested signs to reveal the sacred teachings. The name of the Dharma gate that was spoken should be named after that, so how can it be called the section on manifesting signs?
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a21_3']	若發所說非發起序者，阿難證誰？	若發所說非發起序者，阿難證誰？	001	If it is not the introduction to what is spoken, then who did Ananda testify to?
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a22_1']	證信序若非證信，必不可言序說分故。	證信序若非證信，必不可言序說分故。	001	If the testimony of faith is not the testimony of faith, then it must not be said that it is the introduction because it is spoken.
['ZH_T37_1748_001:0132a23_9']	又自世尊諸根悅豫前都未有說序，何所說故作序說分之名也？	又自世尊諸根悅豫前都未有說序，何所說故作序說分之名也？	001	Also, before the World-Honored One's faculties were delighted, there was no introduction spoken at all. What was spoken to make the name of the introduction and spoken part?
