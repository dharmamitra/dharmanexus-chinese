['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495a22_18']	夢，愚夫妄計而起常見，佛為說空無常剎那，以不了故，復計無常作剎那想，如河燈也。	夢，愚夫妄計而起常見，佛為說空無常剎那，以不了故，復計無常作剎那想，如河燈也。	Discriminating the meaning of 'moment' is like a river, a lamp, and a seed. All conditioned dharmas are like illusions and dreams. Foolish people falsely imagine and give rise to the view of permanence. The Buddha explains to them that they are empty, impermanent, and momentary. Because they do not understand, they again imagine impermanence and give rise to the notion of momentariness, like a river or a lamp.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495a24_2']	「一切法不生，寂靜無所作，諸事性皆離，是我剎那義。	「一切法不生，寂靜無所作，諸事性皆離，是我剎那義。	All dharmas are unborn, quiescent, and without activity. The natures of all things are all detached. This is the meaning of 'moment.'
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495a26_5']	」以一切法剎那流轉必無自性，無自性故即是無生，若非無生則不流轉，契無生者方見剎那。	」以一切法剎那流轉必無自性，無自性故即是無生，若非無生則不流轉，契無生者方見剎那。	 Because all dharmas flow and turn in a moment, they definitely have no self-nature. Because they have no self-nature, they are precisely unborn. If they were not unborn, then they would not flow and turn. One who accords with the unborn will only then see the moment.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495a26_22']	故《淨名》云「不生不滅，是無常義。	故《淨名》云「不生不滅，是無常義。	Therefore the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says: Non-arising and non-ceasing is the meaning of impermanence.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495a28_2']	」「生無間即滅，不為凡愚說，是間相續法，諸趣分別起。	」「生無間即滅，不為凡愚說，是間相續法，諸趣分別起。	 Arising without interval is ceasing. It is not explained for foolish ordinary beings. This is the dharma of continuous moments. The various destinies arise from discrimination.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495a29_10']	」言諸生法即是無生寂滅之相，愚人不信故，不得為愚人說。	」言諸生法即是無生寂滅之相，愚人不信故，不得為愚人說。	The so-called phenomena of birth are precisely the characteristics of non-birth and quiescent extinction. Because the foolish do not believe, one cannot speak for the foolish.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b01_12']	是間若計定有剎那相續法者，則有六趣妄想生。	是間若計定有剎那相續法者，則有六趣妄想生。	Here, if one calculates that there are definitely momentary and continuous phenomena, then there is the arising of the six destinies' delusions.

['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b03_14']	」明妄心識從彼無明生也。	」明妄心識從彼無明生也。	It clarifies that the deluded mind and consciousness arise from that ignorance.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b04_20']	若妄心未生，未能分別色時，中間則無法，夫何所住耶？	若妄心未生，未能分別色時，中間則無法，夫何所住耶？	If the deluded mind has not yet arisen, and when one is not yet able to discriminate form, there is no dharma in the middle, so what is there to abide in?
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b06_2']	「無間相續滅，而有別心起，不住於色時，何所緣而生？	「無間相續滅，而有別心起，不住於色時，何所緣而生？	The uninterrupted continuity ceases, and a different mind arises. When not abiding in form, what is there to be the object and give rise to [the mind]?
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b07_14']	」言無間相續前念滅已，後念續生，若不住色時，無有所緣，則無生也。	」言無間相續前念滅已，後念續生，若不住色時，無有所緣，則無生也。	It says that the uninterrupted continuity of the previous moment ceases, and the subsequent moment arises in continuity. If not abiding in form, there is no object, then there is no arising.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b09_2']	「若緣彼心起，其因則虛妄，因妄體不成，云何剎那滅？	「若緣彼心起，其因則虛妄，因妄體不成，云何剎那滅？	If the mind arises taking that as its object, its cause is then false. The false cause does not establish its essence, so how can there be momentary cessation?
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b10_1']	」後念以從前念滅處起，故不是如實因生。	」後念以從前念滅處起，故不是如實因生。	The subsequent thought arises from the place where the previous thought ceases, therefore it is not truly caused.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b11_4']	因既虛妄，體不成立，則名無生，故不得言剎那滅壞。	因既虛妄，體不成立，則名無生，故不得言剎那滅壞。	Since the cause is false and the substance is not established, it is called non-arising, therefore it cannot be said to be momentary destruction.
['ZH_T39_1791_009:0495b13_2']	「修行者正受，金剛佛舍利，及以光音宮，世間不壞事。	「修行者正受，金剛佛舍利，及以光音宮，世間不壞事。	The practitioner's samādhi, vajra, Buddha's relics, and the palace of the Ābhāsvara Heaven are indestructible things in the world.
