['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c01_15']	若不開示無由悟入，若不悟入無分別慧，謂趣入行終不得成。	若不開示無由悟入，若不悟入無分別慧，謂趣入行終不得成。	If it is not revealed, there is no way to realize it. If one does not realize non-discriminating wisdom, it is said that the practice of entering the path will never be accomplished.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c02_17']	為開示故復說是言，無為無有實，不起似空花。	為開示故復說是言，無為無有實，不起似空花。	In order to reveal it, it is further said: The unconditioned does not truly exist, it does not arise, like a flower in the sky.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c04_1']	此中簡別立宗言詞，即上真性須簡別意，如前應知。	此中簡別立宗言詞，即上真性須簡別意，如前應知。	The words of the thesis that distinguishes this should be understood as the intention to distinguish the true nature mentioned above.

['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c06_7']	說名無為，翻對有為是無為義，即是虛空、擇、非擇滅及真如性。	說名無為，翻對有為是無為義，即是虛空、擇、非擇滅及真如性。	and is therefore called the unconditioned. The meaning of the unconditioned is the opposite of the conditioned, which refers to the nature of space, cessation through discernment, cessation without discernment, and suchness.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c07_11']	謂前所除法處一分先顯悟入，虛空性空易開示故。	謂前所除法處一分先顯悟入，虛空性空易開示故。	That is to say, the part of the dharma-realm that was previously excluded is first revealed and penetrated, because the nature of space is easy to demonstrate.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c08_10']	唯就空無有質礙物，世間共立名虛空故。	唯就空無有質礙物，世間共立名虛空故。	This is because the world commonly establishes the name “space” based on the mere absence of obstructive objects.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c09_4']	由此為門，悟入所餘無為空性。	由此為門，悟入所餘無為空性。	Based on this as a gateway, one penetrates the nature of space of the remaining unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c10_8']	即此世間所知虛空，就真性故空無有實，是名立宗。	即此世間所知虛空，就真性故空無有實，是名立宗。	This space that is known in the world, due to its true nature, is empty and without reality. This is called the thesis.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c12_6']	即此所立就真性故無實虛空，二宗皆許為不起故，或假立為不起法故，說名為因。	即此所立就真性故無實虛空，二宗皆許為不起故，或假立為不起法故，說名為因。	This established [space], due to its true nature, is without real space, and both theses are accepted as being unarisen, or because it is provisionally established as an unarisen dharma, it is called the reason.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c13_17']	空花無實亦不起故，立為同喻，不說遮止異品立為不同法喻，如前應知。	空花無實亦不起故，立為同喻，不說遮止異品立為不同法喻，如前應知。	Because space-flowers are without reality and also unarisen, it is established as a similar example. It is not said to be a dissimilar example that stops the establishment of the dissimilar class, as should be understood as before.

['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c15_2']	謂就真性虛空無實，以不起故。	謂就真性虛空無實，以不起故。	That is to say, space is without reality due to its true nature, because it is unarisen.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c16_1']	諸不起者愚智同知，其性無實猶如空花。	諸不起者愚智同知，其性無實猶如空花。	The nature of the unarisen is known by both the foolish and the wise to be without reality, just like space-flowers.

['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c17_14']	非所作故、非能作故、無滅壞故。	非所作故、非能作故、無滅壞故。	Because it is not a product, because it is not a producer, because it is not subject to destruction.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c18_16']	如是等因能遮所說無為空性，是故如應皆得為因。	如是等因能遮所說無為空性，是故如應皆得為因。	These reasons can refute the emptiness of the unconditioned that is being proposed. Therefore, they can all be used as reasons as appropriate.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c20_10']	如說汝當守掌此酥勿令烏近，為令所守無損污故，亦應遮彼猫鼠等類。	如說汝當守掌此酥勿令烏近，為令所守無損污故，亦應遮彼猫鼠等類。	Just as it is said, You should guard this butter and keep crows away from it, in order to prevent damage to what is being guarded, one should also prevent cats, mice, and other such creatures.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c21_8', 'ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c22_17']	毘婆沙師咸作是難：🔽若所立宗無為無實，是無有義，空處等至即無所緣，云何得有？	毘婆沙師咸作是難： 若所立宗無為無實，是無有義，空處等至即無所緣，云何得有？	The Vaibhāṣikas all raise this objection:🔽If the thesis being established is that the unconditioned has no real substance, then it is meaningless to say it exists. The attainments of the sphere of infinite space and so forth would then have no object. How could they exist?
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c25_5']	然無障礙是虛空相，此若方便立比量言，空處等至實有所緣，或境實有，是等至故，或是等至所緣境故。	然無障礙是虛空相，此若方便立比量言，空處等至實有所緣，或境實有，是等至故，或是等至所緣境故。	However, the characteristic of space is unobstructedness. If this is established by means of a logical argument, it can be said that the attainments of the sphere of infinite space and so forth do have a real object, or that the object is real because it is an attainment, or because it is the object of an attainment.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c26_17']	如餘等至或如彼緣，其餘等至及彼所緣是有為故，已辯性空則無同喻。	如餘等至或如彼緣，其餘等至及彼所緣是有為故，已辯性空則無同喻。	The other meditative states and their objects are conditioned, and if you say that they are empty of intrinsic nature, then there is no similar example.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c28_12']	此就勝義辯虛空相，若就世俗，所立虛空亦非實有，以不起故，猶如空花。	此就勝義辯虛空相，若就世俗，所立虛空亦非實有，以不起故，猶如空花。	If you discuss the characteristics of space from the ultimate standpoint, then space as it is defined does not really exist, because it does not perform a function, just as a flower in the air does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0273c29_5']	由此比量，彼所建立實有不成。	由此比量，彼所建立實有不成。	Consequently, the existence of space as a real entity cannot be established by inference.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a01_13']	又即由此我所說因，汝言等至所緣境故，因有決定相違過失。	又即由此我所說因，汝言等至所緣境故，因有決定相違過失。	Moreover, because of the reason that you yourself have given, namely, that space is the object of meditative states, your reason is contradictory.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a02_8']	是故我先所立義成，無障難故。	是故我先所立義成，無障難故。	Therefore, my original thesis is established, because there is no refutation of it.

['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a04_13']	此言義准，起者皆實。	此言義准，起者皆實。	then the meaning of this statement implies that that which does perform a function really exists.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a05_16']	若言起者亦無有實，是則此因不遍同品，因性不成。	若言起者亦無有實，是則此因不遍同品，因性不成。	If you say that that which performs a function also does not really exist, then this reason is not found in similar instances, and the reason is not established.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a06_10']	此是義准，相似過類似不成過。	此是義准，相似過類似不成過。	This is an implication of the meaning of this statement, and it is similar to the fallacy of a reason that is not established.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a07_4']	此審定言，諸不起者皆無有實；	此審定言，諸不起者皆無有實；	The words “definite” and “not definite” mean that all things that do not arise are all unreal,
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a07_18']	非審定言，諸無實者悉皆不起。	非審定言，諸無實者悉皆不起。	and that all things that are unreal do not arise.

['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a12_11']	空花二種雖不相應非無自性，故空花喻所立不成。	空花二種雖不相應非無自性，故空花喻所立不成。	Although the two, space and flowers, are not related, they are not without their own natures. Therefore the example of space and flowers is not established.”

['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a14_9']	此空花喻，就第六轉依士訓釋空之花，故說名空花，此既非有，故喻非無。	此空花喻，就第六轉依士訓釋空之花，故說名空花，此既非有，故喻非無。	This example of space and flowers is based on the sixth mode of conversion, which is the analysis of the compound as a genitive tatpuruṣa, and therefore it is called space flowers. Since this is nonexistent, the example is not nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1578_002:0274a16_15']	由此道理，修觀行者應正悟入虛空性空，於擇滅等三種無為性空道理亦當悟入。	由此道理，修觀行者應正悟入虛空性空，於擇滅等三種無為性空道理亦當悟入。	For this reason, the practitioner should correctly penetrate the emptiness of the nature of space, and he should also penetrate the principle of the emptiness of the natures of the three kinds of unconditioned dharmas, such as cessation resulting from discrimination.

Therefore, he speaks conventionally of the existence of cessation, emancipation, nirvana, tranquility, and subtlety.

By the power of common acceptance, dharmas are generally established. The distinction of negation is not commonly known and is established as the property of the thesis.
