['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861a26_13']	二用。	二用。	Second, function.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861a27_3']	第一內空，亦名受者空。	第一內空，亦名受者空。	The first is internal emptiness, also called the emptiness of the recipient.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861a28_4']	凡夫二乘謂六入為受者，以能受六塵果報故。	凡夫二乘謂六入為受者，以能受六塵果報故。	Ordinary beings and the two vehicles consider the six sense bases to be the recipient, because they can receive the retribution of the six sense objects.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b01_10']	第二外空，亦名所受空。	第二外空，亦名所受空。	The second is external emptiness, also called the emptiness of what is received.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b02_4']	離六外入無別法為可受者也。	離六外入無別法為可受者也。	Apart from the six external sense bases, there is no separate dharma that can be received.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b03_18']	若諸眾生所受所用但是六塵，內既無人能受、外亦無法可受，即人法俱空。	若諸眾生所受所用但是六塵，內既無人能受、外亦無法可受，即人法俱空。	If the receiving and using of all sentient beings is only the six sense objects, since internally there is no person who can receive, and externally there is also no dharma that can be received, then both person and dharma are empty.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b04_8']	唯識無境，故名外空。	唯識無境，故名外空。	Only consciousness without objects is called external emptiness.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b05_2']	以無境故，亦無有識，即是內空。	以無境故，亦無有識，即是內空。	Because there are no objects, there is also no consciousness, which is precisely internal emptiness.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b05_12']	六入無識，即是無人；	六入無識，即是無人；	The six sense bases being without consciousness is precisely the absence of a person;

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b06_13']	故內外二空，兩義相成也。	故內外二空，兩義相成也。	Therefore, the two meanings of internal and external emptiness mutually support each other.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b07_10']	第三內外空，謂身空也。	第三內外空，謂身空也。	Third, internal and external emptiness refers to the emptiness of the body.

The internal basis refers to the six sense organs. If the five sense organs all have pure form, and the mental organ is also based on this body, it is called the internal basis.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b11_17']	外依者，謂外六塵，若己身四大，唯除五根淨色，所餘色香等屬外六塵，攝持於五根故稱為外，非謂離身之外也。	外依者，謂外六塵，若己身四大，唯除五根淨色，所餘色香等屬外六塵，攝持於五根故稱為外，非謂離身之外也。	The external basis refers to the external six sense objects. If one's own body's four great elements, except for the pure form of the five sense organs, the remaining form, smell, etc. belong to the external six sense objects, because they hold the five sense organs, they are called external, not referring to what is outside the body.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b12_16']	此身能持根塵，故名為依，根塵所依也。	此身能持根塵，故名為依，根塵所依也。	This body can hold the sense organs and sense objects, so it is called the basis, the basis of the sense organs and sense objects.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b13_13']	此根及非根皆悉是空，故名內外空也。	此根及非根皆悉是空，故名內外空也。	These sense organs and what is not a sense organ are all empty, so it is called internal and external emptiness.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b15_11']	十方無量無邊皆悉是空，故名大空。	十方無量無邊皆悉是空，故名大空。	The ten directions are immeasurable and boundless, all of which are empty, so it is called great emptiness.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b17_4']	第五空空，能照真之相會前四空，從境得名呼為空智。	第五空空，能照真之相會前四空，從境得名呼為空智。	The fifth is the emptiness of emptiness, which illuminates the characteristics of the true and unifies the previous four emptinesses. It is called the wisdom of emptiness from the perspective of the object.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b17_14']	空智亦空，故立空空。	空智亦空，故立空空。	The wisdom of emptiness is also empty, so it is established as the emptiness of emptiness.

This realm is true, so it is given the name of true reality. Due to the nature of discrimination, the nature cannot be obtained, and the emptiness of nature is precisely the emptiness of true reality.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861b28_13']	由此智見前境是無人無法，即治前境。	由此智見前境是無人無法，即治前境。	By this cognition seeing the previous objects as devoid of people and dharmas, it treats the previous objects.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861c01_11']	若無第六境空治第五智，此智既但真解，還成分別性，故言第六真實空名為治智也。	若無第六境空治第五智，此智既但真解，還成分別性，故言第六真實空名為治智也。	If there is no sixth emptiness of objects to treat the fifth emptiness of cognition, this cognition, being only true understanding, would still be categorized as the nature of discrimination, so it is said that the sixth true emptiness is called the treatment of cognition.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861c02_9']	第二義明空自有十二：	第二義明空自有十二：	The second meaning clarifies emptiness itself having twelve aspects:

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861c13_11']	第三畢竟空，為恒利益他菩薩修空畢竟，恒欲利他至眾生盡誓恒教化。	第三畢竟空，為恒利益他菩薩修空畢竟，恒欲利他至眾生盡誓恒教化。	The third, ultimate emptiness, is for always benefiting others. The bodhisattva cultivates emptiness to the ultimate, always wishing to benefit others until the end of sentient beings, vowing to always teach and transform.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861c13_16']	此心有著。	此心有著。	This mind has attachment.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861c23_1']	既不分別始終，則於短於長心無憂喜，於長不憂、聞短不喜。	既不分別始終，則於短於長心無憂喜，於長不憂、聞短不喜。	Since they do not discriminate between beginning and end, they have no worries or joys regarding short or long. They do not worry about the long or rejoice in hearing the short.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0861c23_13']	既離憂喜，則能不捨生死。	既離憂喜，則能不捨生死。	Since they are free from worries and joys, they are able to not abandon birth and death.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a01_3']	如來雖入涅槃，猶隨眾生機緣現應化兩身，導利含識，即是更起心義。	如來雖入涅槃，猶隨眾生機緣現應化兩身，導利含識，即是更起心義。	Although the Tathāgata enters nirvāṇa, he still manifests the two bodies of transformation and response in accordance with the capacities and conditions of beings, guiding and benefiting sentient beings. This is the meaning of again giving rise to the mind.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a01_17']	故眾生不盡，應化之用亦不盡。	故眾生不盡，應化之用亦不盡。	Therefore, as long as beings are not exhausted, the function of the transformation and response bodies is also not exhausted.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a02_12']	故言雖入無餘而不捨功德善根也。	故言雖入無餘而不捨功德善根也。	Therefore, it is said that even though he enters the nirvāṇa without remainder, he does not abandon meritorious virtues and wholesome roots.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a03_14']	若二乘入滅，無更起心，以慈悲薄少不化眾生。	若二乘入滅，無更起心，以慈悲薄少不化眾生。	If the two vehicles enter cessation, they do not again give rise to the mind, because their compassion is meager and they do not transform beings.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a06_8']	若佛入無餘而更起心者，以諸佛菩薩三身利物無窮故，如來法身即是一切無流法之依處故，言散滅不捨離功德也。	若佛入無餘而更起心者，以諸佛菩薩三身利物無窮故，如來法身即是一切無流法之依處故，言散滅不捨離功德也。	If the Buddha enters the nirvāṇa without remainder and again gives rise to the mind, it is because the three bodies of all buddhas and bodhisattvas benefit beings without end. Because the Tathāgata's Dharma body is precisely the basis of all uncontaminated dharmas, it is said that the meritorious virtues are not abandoned or dispersed.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a07_9']	所以得知涅槃之中猶有法身者，以用終體。	所以得知涅槃之中猶有法身者，以用終體。	Therefore, we know that within nirvāṇa there is still the Dharma body, because the function is the ultimate substance.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a08_15']	既覩應化之用不盡，故知此身之體常自湛然、永無遷壞。	既覩應化之用不盡，故知此身之體常自湛然、永無遷壞。	Since we see that the function of responsive transformation is inexhaustible, we know that this body's substance is eternally tranquil and never changes or decays.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a11_8']	若不依涅槃不成智慧，智慧不成則煩惱不滅。	若不依涅槃不成智慧，智慧不成則煩惱不滅。	If one does not rely on nirvāṇa, wisdom cannot be accomplished. If wisdom is not accomplished, then afflictions cannot be extinguished.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a12_8']	涅槃既能生道，道能滅惑，即是涅槃家事。	涅槃既能生道，道能滅惑，即是涅槃家事。	Since nirvāṇa can give rise to the path and the path can extinguish delusions, this is the function of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a13_5']	既見有事，則知應有體，故不得言無也。	既見有事，則知應有體，故不得言無也。	Since there is seen to be a function, we know that there must be a substance, and therefore we cannot say it does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a13_19']	如來法身在涅槃中，即義亦爾。	如來法身在涅槃中，即義亦爾。	The Tathāgata's Dharma body being within nirvāṇa is also like this in meaning.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0862a15_13']	為除分別涅槃不捨功德，即是分別性，真實義中無此分別，故名不捨離空。	為除分別涅槃不捨功德，即是分別性，真實義中無此分別，故名不捨離空。	In order to eliminate the distinction of nirvāṇa not abandoning merits, this is the nature of discrimination.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c04_17']	三如如色，若是分別假名一向無體，即是法空。	三如如色，若是分別假名一向無體，即是法空。	Third, suchness form, if it is a conceptual fiction that is completely non-existent, then it is the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c06_2']	若是依他假，雖復有體，體非真實、依他而有，即有法空。	若是依他假，雖復有體，體非真實、依他而有，即有法空。	If it is a dependent fiction, although it does exist, its existence is not real, but rather exists in dependence on others. Then there is the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c07_7']	此兩空之體，既是真實，故名如如色，以如是色之自性故。	此兩空之體，既是真實，故名如如色，以如是色之自性故。	Since the essence of these two kinds of emptiness is real, it is called suchness form, because it is the self-nature of suchness form.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c09_7']	以色目於如如，此是如如家色故，言如如色也，以末從本為名，亦可得言以本來目於末。	以色目於如如，此是如如家色故，言如如色也，以末從本為名，亦可得言以本來目於末。	Using form to refer to thusness is the form of thusness, so it is called the form of thusness. Taking the end from the beginning, it can also be said to use the original to refer to the end.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c10_7']	此之真實，名真實假，假體即空，故名真實。	此之真實，名真實假，假體即空，故名真實。	This reality is called true convention. The essence of convention is emptiness, so it is called true.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c11_3']	假空即如如，真實之相亦不可得也。	假空即如如，真實之相亦不可得也。	Convention and emptiness are thusness. The characteristics of truth cannot be grasped either.

They are all subsumed by the three conventions.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c14_2']	受苦受樂是分別假，分別體從因緣生，有因有果即依他假。	受苦受樂是分別假，分別體從因緣生，有因有果即依他假。	Feeling, whether painful or pleasant, is conventional discrimination. The essence of discrimination arises from causes and conditions. Having causes and effects is conventional dependence.

Dharmas and non-dharmas cause the mind to unite with the self, and because of the union, there is knowledge. Because of knowledge, there is pleasure. Because of pleasure, there is pain. Due to pleasure, desire arises. Due to pain, anger arises. Desiring pleasure, one therefore tires of pain and cultivates effort. Due to effort, there is right memory. In order to attain liberation, one needs to eliminate dharmas and non-dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0865c25_1']	法非法不生則無有知，以無知故無苦樂等。	法非法不生則無有知，以無知故無苦樂等。	If dharmas and non-dharmas are not produced, then there is no knowledge. Due to the absence of knowledge, there is no pain, pleasure, and so forth.

In a good realm, one obtains happiness. In happiness, there is wisdom. Wisdom then gives rise to aversion to dharmas and non-dharmas. Aversion to dharmas and non-dharmas then leads to liberation.

If the mind is permanent, then there is no cause and effect. Because the mind is impermanent, the meaning of cause and effect is established.

This would be self-mastery, not dependent origination.

Cause depends on effect, and effect relies on cause. They mutually require each other and are all dependent. Therefore, they are provisional and do not have real nature.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0866c14_3']	若不相似，則失因果之義。	若不相似，則失因果之義。	If they are not similar, then the meaning of cause and effect is lost.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0866c14_19']	如豆不生麥，以非因故，不互相生。	如豆不生麥，以非因故，不互相生。	Just as beans do not produce barley, because they are not causes, they do not mutually produce each other.

Moreover, having outflows should lead to the attainment of liberation, and without outflows would further increase birth and death.
['ZH_T31_1616_001:0866c18_5']	是故無常生無常，此任自然之理，不勞執有作意。	是故無常生無常，此任自然之理，不勞執有作意。	Therefore, the impermanent produces the impermanent. This is the principle of naturalness. It does not trouble itself with the intention of having a creator.

['ZH_T31_1616_001:0866c21_8']	此十二緣體中，若是果報分者，實若厭離，以破貪愛，顯無願解脫門。	此十二緣體中，若是果報分者，實若厭離，以破貪愛，顯無願解脫門。	Within the substance of these twelve links of dependent arising, if it is the part of karmic retribution, it is real. If one is disgusted with it, it destroys craving and manifests the gate of liberation of wishlessness.

If one can understand that all karmic activities arise from ignorance, then the mind that manifests the darkness of ignorance ceases. Ignorance is the cause of grasping at the characteristics of the four kinds of denial. Refuting this ignorance reveals the gate of liberation of signlessness.
