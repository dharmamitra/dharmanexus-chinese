['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c13_14']	妙智揀二乘麁智，正觀揀凡夫倒見，既以妙智正觀有為諸法，如夢幻等，故涉有而不住有，觀空而不住空，用而常寂、寂而常用，故終日說法終日涅槃。	妙智揀二乘麁智，正觀揀凡夫倒見，既以妙智正觀有為諸法，如夢幻等，故涉有而不住有，觀空而不住空，用而常寂、寂而常用，故終日說法終日涅槃。	Wondrous wisdom distinguishes the coarse wisdom of the two vehicles, right observation distinguishes the inverted views of ordinary beings. Since one uses wondrous wisdom to right observe all conditioned dharmas as being like dreams, illusions, etc., therefore one engages with existence but does not abide in existence, observes emptiness but does not abide in emptiness, functions while always quiescent, quiescent while always functioning. Therefore one speaks the Dharma all day long and enters nirvana all day long.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c14_1']	如《華嚴疏》云：	如《華嚴疏》云：	As the Huayan Commentary says:
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c14_20']	「寂寥於萬化之域，動用於一虛之中」也。	「寂寥於萬化之域，動用於一虛之中」也。	Solitary and vast within the realm of myriad transformations, moving and functioning within the single void.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c16_13']	故知若不涉有，豈名大乘涅槃，若不證如，何名無染說法，言雖似反意乃相符。	故知若不涉有，豈名大乘涅槃，若不證如，何名無染說法，言雖似反意乃相符。	Therefore know that if one does not engage with existence, how can it be called the Mahayana nirvana? If one does not realize suchness, how can it be called speaking the Dharma without defilement? Although the words seem contradictory, the meaning is actually consistent.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c18_2']	善現約極違以申疑，如來據極順以通釋，理實深妙光茲末篇。	善現約極違以申疑，如來據極順以通釋，理實深妙光茲末篇。	Subhūti raises the question based on the greatest opposition, the Tathāgata resolves it based on the greatest accord. The principle is truly profound and wondrous, shining forth in this final chapter.

['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c23_8']	初、文二初、釋章意此見等者，謂見相二分，以自證分為體，然此三法是生死之自性，一切生死從此而生，故名此三為根本矣，此通八識也。	初、文二初、釋章意此見等者，謂見相二分，以自證分為體，然此三法是生死之自性，一切生死從此而生，故名此三為根本矣，此通八識也。	First, the text, in two parts. First, explaining the meaning of the chapter. The seen and seeing parts take the self-verifying part as their essence. These three dharmas are the intrinsic nature of birth and death. All birth and death arise from this, so these three are called the root. This applies to the eight consciousnesses.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c23_12']	一星下。	一星下。	One star, etc.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c24_10']	二、別解文三初、文見分者，雲云第六識也。	二、別解文三初、文見分者，雲云第六識也。	Second, the specific explanation of the text, in three parts. First, the seen part. The commentary says it is the sixth consciousness.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c25_17']	計度分別緣共相境，世間諸智盡在其中，故以星光況於此識。	計度分別緣共相境，世間諸智盡在其中，故以星光況於此識。	The conceptual discrimination takes the common characteristic as its object. All worldly knowledge is contained within it, so the starlight is used as a metaphor for this consciousness.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c26_17']	此約執計強盛，故獨指第六，非不通八也。	此約執計強盛，故獨指第六，非不通八也。	This is based on the strong and vigorous grasping and conceptualization, so it specifically points to the sixth consciousness, but it is not limited to the eighth consciousness.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c27_2']	無智等者。	無智等者。	Lack of wisdom, etc.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c27_14']	此中法喻相兼，文猶闕略。	此中法喻相兼，文猶闕略。	Here, the dharma and metaphor are combined, and the text is still incomplete.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0225c29_4']	若具配屬，即法喻四對，謂以日喻智、以星喻識、以明喻悟、以闇喻迷。	若具配屬，即法喻四對，謂以日喻智、以星喻識、以明喻悟、以闇喻迷。	If fully matched, there are four pairs of principle and analogy, namely using the sun to analogize wisdom, using the stars to analogize consciousness, using brightness to analogize enlightenment, and using darkness to analogize delusion.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a02_11']	且如喻中，意云無日闇中有星光故，有日明中無星光故，法中無智迷中有識用故，有智悟中無分別故。	且如喻中，意云無日闇中有星光故，有日明中無星光故，法中無智迷中有識用故，有智悟中無分別故。	Moreover, in the analogy it is said that in the darkness without the sun, there is the light of the stars, but in the brightness with the sun, there is no light of the stars. In the principle, in the delusion without wisdom, there is the function of consciousness, but in the enlightenment with wisdom, there is no discrimination.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a03_19']	其猶昏夜日光黯然，唯星獨存略辨南北，杲日纔現星光自存。	其猶昏夜日光黯然，唯星獨存略辨南北，杲日纔現星光自存。	It is just like in the dark night, the sunlight is dim and only the stars remain, slightly distinguishing the directions. As soon as the bright sun appears, the starlight disappears by itself.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a06_2']	法中亦爾，生死迷中本智未顯，意識分別似有鑒覺，若智顯彰光明遍照，分別念慮泯然無餘。	法中亦爾，生死迷中本智未顯，意識分別似有鑒覺，若智顯彰光明遍照，分別念慮泯然無餘。	The principle is also like this. In the delusion of birth and death, the fundamental wisdom is not yet revealed, and the discrimination of the thinking consciousness seems to have the function of cognition. If wisdom is manifested and the light shines everywhere, the thoughts and considerations of discrimination disappear without a trace.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a06_7']	無彼光者。	無彼光者。	There is no such light.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a06_12']	此約分喻。	此約分喻。	This is based on a partial analogy.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a07_17']	喻中俱無星光，而不無星體，法中融同一智，無別識心故。	喻中俱無星光，而不無星體，法中融同一智，無別識心故。	In the analogy, both lack the light of the stars, but they do not lack the substance of the stars. In the principle, they merge as one wisdom, without a separate consciousness.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a08_4']	二中如目等者。	二中如目等者。	In the second, it is like the eyes, etc.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a08_7']	意云：	意云：	The meaning is saying:
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a09_5']	翳若在眼則見毛輪，執若在意見實我法。	翳若在眼則見毛輪，執若在意見實我法。	If the eye is diseased, one sees floating hairs and circles of wool. If the mind is diseased, one grasps at real selves and dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a10_6']	若正配法喻，即翳喻第七識，毛輪等喻所見分。	若正配法喻，即翳喻第七識，毛輪等喻所見分。	If the analogy is matched with the dharma, then the disease is analogous to the seventh consciousness, and the floating hairs, etc. are analogous to the seeing part.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a11_2']	今標云翳喻所見分者，此有三意：	今標云翳喻所見分者，此有三意：	Now, the statement that the disease is analogous to the seeing part has three meanings:
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a13_1']	一、密配第七識，謂若但取毛輪則唯喻所見，第七意識無因可收，故此密配無所遺也。	一、密配第七識，謂若但取毛輪則唯喻所見，第七意識無因可收，故此密配無所遺也。	First, it secretly matches it with the seventh consciousness. If one only takes the floating hairs, then it only illustrates the seeing part. The seventh consciousness has no cause to include, so this secretly matches it without leaving anything out.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a14_7']	二、交互影略，以喻上舉能法中言所，自然影略，說收所餘。	二、交互影略，以喻上舉能法中言所，自然影略，說收所餘。	Second, it is a mutual abbreviation. In the above explanation of the able dharma, it says the seen. Naturally, it is abbreviated. It explains the inclusion of the rest.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a15_20']	三、顯示毛月無有體性，意雖在所，今却舉能，以顯所從能生，足知無體也。	三、顯示毛月無有體性，意雖在所，今却舉能，以顯所從能生，足知無體也。	Third, it shows that the floating hairs and moon have no substance. Although the meaning is in the seen, now it raises the able in order to illustrate that the seen arises from the able, and it is sufficient to know that it has no substance.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a16_5']	以顛倒見者。	以顛倒見者。	As for seeing upside down,
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a16_11']	出無體所以。	出無體所以。	it explains the reason for having no substance.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a17_12']	於無見有故云顛倒，取無義者，情有理無故。	於無見有故云顛倒，取無義者，情有理無故。	Because one sees existence in nonexistence, it is called upside down. As for grasping at nonexistent meaning, it is because of the existence of feelings and the nonexistence of principle.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a18_18']	三中燈喻識者，理則雖通，義當前五，以六七八識各有配故。	三中燈喻識者，理則雖通，義當前五，以六七八識各有配故。	Among the three, the lamp metaphor for consciousness is reasonable, but in meaning it corresponds to the first five, because the sixth, seventh, and eighth consciousnesses each have their own correspondences.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a19_3']	燈約等者。	燈約等者。	The lamp is about equality.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a20_15']	以膏油喻貪愛，以燈喻識，若無膏油則燈光不起，若無貪愛則識念不生。	以膏油喻貪愛，以燈喻識，若無膏油則燈光不起，若無貪愛則識念不生。	Using ghee and oil to metaphorize craving and love, using the lamp to metaphorize consciousness, if there is no ghee and oil then the light of the lamp does not arise, if there is no craving and love then the thoughts of consciousness do not arise.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a20_19']	故論云：	故論云：	Therefore the treatise says:
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a21_7']	「依止貪愛法住。	「依止貪愛法住。	Relying on the Dharma of craving and love to abide.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a22_9']	」然此上三喻，皆是能熏染污根本，故通名自性相。	」然此上三喻，皆是能熏染污根本，故通名自性相。	However, these above three metaphors are all the fundamental defiled perfuming, therefore they are all called the characteristics of self-nature.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a23_10']	其所熏第八識持種引心，配屬雲喻如下所明。	其所熏第八識持種引心，配屬雲喻如下所明。	The eighth consciousness that holds the seeds and attracts the mind that is perfumed by them is matched with the metaphor of clouds as will be clarified below.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a25_2']	或可星喻見分，翳目所見毛月喻相分，燈喻自證分，自證分即第八識。	或可星喻見分，翳目所見毛月喻相分，燈喻自證分，自證分即第八識。	Or the stars metaphorize the seeing part, the hair seen by the eyes with cataracts metaphorizes the part of characteristics, and the lamp metaphorizes the part of self-realization, the part of self-realization is the eighth consciousness.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a25_18']	其後雲喻，但況識中種子為未來法。	其後雲喻，但況識中種子為未來法。	The later metaphor of clouds just illustrates the seeds in consciousness becoming the dharmas of the future.
['ZH_T33_1702_007:0226a26_4']	著所住味者。	著所住味者。	The taste of what one dwells in.
