Then, nine hundred years after the Buddha's passing, Asanga requested Maitreya to expound the middle way, and taught the Yoga Saptasatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra and the Madhyāntavibhāga, which were all spoken by Maitreya. They are all as explained in the extensive chapters, with slight differences, as on a separate piece of paper.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125a23_17']	二、明論因起者，《攝大乘》云有二種藏，一、聲聞藏，二、菩薩藏。	二、明論因起者，《攝大乘》云有二種藏，一、聲聞藏，二、菩薩藏。	001	Second, explaining the causes and origins of the treatise. The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says there are two kinds of piṭakas: the śrāvaka piṭaka and the bodhisattva piṭaka.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125a28_15']	於中有三，謂素怛覽、阿毘達磨、毘奈耶，謂《華嚴》、《般若》等名菩薩藏中素怛覽，《解深密》、《阿毘達磨經》名阿毘達磨藏，《毘奈耶．瞿沙經》名第三藏，然上諸經唯依梵本各有多頌，以漸隱沒卷軸便小，或此方翻者偏略，所以漸約也。	於中有三，謂素怛覽、阿毘達磨、毘奈耶，謂《華嚴》、《般若》等名菩薩藏中素怛覽，《解深密》、《阿毘達磨經》名阿毘達磨藏，《毘奈耶．瞿沙經》名第三藏，然上諸經唯依梵本各有多頌，以漸隱沒卷軸便小，或此方翻者偏略，所以漸約也。	001	There are three within this, namely the Sūtra, Abhidharma, and Vinaya. The Huayan, Prajñā, and other sūtras are called the Sūtras in the Bodhisattva Canon. The Saṃdhinirmocana and Abhidharma Sūtras are called the Abhidharma Canon. The Vinaya-Kuśa Sūtra is called the third canon. However, the above sūtras, based only on the Sanskrit originals, each have many verses, which gradually disappeared and the scrolls became smaller. Perhaps those who translated them into this land were biased and brief, so they gradually became concise.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b01_1']	即《阿毘達磨經》中有《攝大乘品》，佛當加持菩薩所說；	即《阿毘達磨經》中有《攝大乘品》，佛當加持菩薩所說；	001	In the Abhidharma Sūtras, there is the Mahāyānasaṃgraha Chapter, which was spoken by a Bodhisattva empowered by the Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b02_17']	佛去世後九百餘年，無著菩薩撮集諸經統攝其義，為二萬七千頌名《對法論》；	佛去世後九百餘年，無著菩薩撮集諸經統攝其義，為二萬七千頌名《對法論》；	001	More than nine hundred years after the Buddha's passing, Bodhisattva Asaṅga compiled the meanings of various sūtras into a work of twenty-seven thousand verses called the Abhidharma Treatise.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b04_10']	後有其資名浮陀僧訶，此名覺師子，造六萬三千頌釋，與前師造兩本別行；	後有其資名浮陀僧訶，此名覺師子，造六萬三千頌釋，與前師造兩本別行；	001	Later, there was a master named Buddhadasa, also called Bodhisattvasimha, who composed a commentary in 63,000 verses, which was different from the two versions composed by the previous masters and circulated separately;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b06_15']	後有菩薩名安慧，糅為一部，故稱為《雜集》，即《瑜伽》十支中之一支也，謂《三十唯識》等各為一支故。	後有菩薩名安慧，糅為一部，故稱為《雜集》，即《瑜伽》十支中之一支也，謂《三十唯識》等各為一支故。	001	Later, there was a bodhisattva named Sthiramati, who compiled it into one work, thus calling it the Compendium, which is one of the ten branches of the Yoga, namely the Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only and so on, each being one branch.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b07_21']	如迦旃延三百年後造《發智論》，而後有「六足諸論」等。	如迦旃延三百年後造《發智論》，而後有「六足諸論」等。	001	Just as Katyayana composed the Abhidharma-hrdaya-sastra three hundred years after the Buddha's nirvana, and later there were the Six-foot Treatises and so on.

['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b11_13']	經者，然此般若上代已來總有五譯，出其年代具如《玄記》。	經者，然此般若上代已來總有五譯，出其年代具如《玄記》。	001	As for the sutra, there have been a total of five translations of this Prajna Paramita since ancient times. The dates of their appearance are fully recorded in the Xuanji.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b12_20']	然三藏貞觀十九年初從西至，最初翻譯其論也，《對法》為先。	然三藏貞觀十九年初從西至，最初翻譯其論也，《對法》為先。	001	However, when the Tripiṭaka master first arrived from the west in the 19th year of Zhenguan, the first translation he made was the treatise, with the Abhidharma coming first.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b15_19']	至貞觀二十三年，三藏隨駕玉華，先帝乖和，頻崇功德，共藏譯論，遍度五人，更問良因，藏令弘讚，遂制般若之序，名《三藏聖教序》。	至貞觀二十三年，三藏隨駕玉華，先帝乖和，頻崇功德，共藏譯論，遍度五人，更問良因，藏令弘讚，遂制般若之序，名《三藏聖教序》。	001	In the 23rd year of Zhenguan, the Tripiṭaka master followed the imperial carriage to Yuhua, and the former emperor, being in discord, frequently promoted merit and virtue, and together with the Tripiṭaka master translated the treatise, universally liberating five people, and further inquiring about the good causes, the Tripiṭaka master ordered him to propagate and praise it, and thus composed the preface to the Prajñāpāramitā, named Preface to the Holy Teachings of the Tripiṭaka.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b17_13']	其時太子亦製《顯揚論序》，當許雜翻經論，竝讚幽靈，既有違和，不暇廣製也。	其時太子亦製《顯揚論序》，當許雜翻經論，竝讚幽靈，既有違和，不暇廣製也。	001	At that time, the Crown Prince also composed a preface to the Vyākhyāyukti, and was allowed to translate miscellaneous sūtras and śāstras, both praising the profound principles. Since there was discord, he did not have time to compose extensively.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b17_20']	于時帝問藏云：	于時帝問藏云：	001	At that time, the Emperor asked the Tripiṭaka master:
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b18_9']	「更有何善而可修耶？	「更有何善而可修耶？	001	Are there any other good deeds that can be practiced?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b18_14']	」藏報云：	」藏報云：	001	The Tripiṭaka master replied:
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b19_1']	「可執筆以綴般若。	「可執筆以綴般若。	001	You can take up the brush and compose the Prajñāpāramitā.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b21_19']	」帝既許之，藏便譯出，其夜五更三點翻譯即了，帝索讀之，即遣所司寫一萬本，既不重綴，詞句遂疎，後欲重譯，無由改採前布也。	」帝既許之，藏便譯出，其夜五更三點翻譯即了，帝索讀之，即遣所司寫一萬本，既不重綴，詞句遂疎，後欲重譯，無由改採前布也。	001	The Emperor having granted permission, An Shigao translated it. That night, at the third watch, the translation was completed. The Emperor requested to read it and immediately ordered the authorities to copy ten thousand copies. Since it was not re-edited, the wording became loose. Later, when wanting to re-translate, there was no way to revise the previous draft.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b26_3']	當爾積代梵本文竝付三藏，藏討諸本龜資梵文即羅什譯，同崑崙之本與真諦翻等，然經文舛異，隨文乃知真謬，題名不同，三藏獨名《能斷》，即先所譯，無著論本亦名《能斷》，何意然也？	當爾積代梵本文竝付三藏，藏討諸本龜資梵文即羅什譯，同崑崙之本與真諦翻等，然經文舛異，隨文乃知真謬，題名不同，三藏獨名《能斷》，即先所譯，無著論本亦名《能斷》，何意然也？	001	At that time, the Sanskrit texts of the past dynasties were all entrusted to the Tripiṭaka Master. An Shigao searched through the various texts and found that the Sanskrit text was the same as Kumārajīva's translation based on the Khotan text and Paramārtha's translation, etc. However, the text of the sūtra differed, and one could know the truth and falsehood according to the text. The titles were different, and the Tripiṭaka Master alone named it the Diamond Sūtra. The text translated earlier by Aśvaghoṣa was also named the Diamond Sūtra. What is the reason for this?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b26_12']	彼意說金剛有三義。	彼意說金剛有三義。	001	The meaning of the text says that the Diamond has three meanings.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b27_11']	一、所破義，無著論本云，正見行、邪見行。	一、所破義，無著論本云，正見行、邪見行。	001	First, the meaning of what is to be destroyed. The text of Aśvaghoṣa's treatise says, The practice of right views and the practice of wrong views.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b28_10']	解云，正邪雖異，還作是同，故行該兩種見。	解云，正邪雖異，還作是同，故行該兩種見。	001	The explanation says, Although right and wrong are different, they still form the same. Therefore, the practice includes both kinds of views.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125b29_2']	即喻金剛雖一，能、所有殊。	即喻金剛雖一，能、所有殊。	001	The analogy is that although the vajra is one, its ability and possession are different.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c01_5']	雖曰金剛，亦有物能破之，故如白羊角即破金剛也。	雖曰金剛，亦有物能破之，故如白羊角即破金剛也。	001	Although it is called vajra, there are also things that can break it, so the horn of a white sheep can break the vajra.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c02_2']	二、能摧義，無著云，一者、細，是智因故；	二、能摧義，無著云，一者、細，是智因故；	001	Second, the meaning of being able to destroy. Asanga says, first, being subtle is because it is the cause of wisdom;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c02_12']	二、牢者，不可壞故。	二、牢者，不可壞故。	001	second, being firm is because it is indestructible.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c03_19']	解云，聞、思兩慧能伏染故，漸生修慧，故名能摧，稱為智因也。	解云，聞、思兩慧能伏染故，漸生修慧，故名能摧，稱為智因也。	001	The explanation says, the two wisdoms of hearing and contemplation can subdue defilements, gradually giving rise to the wisdom of cultivation, therefore it is called being able to destroy, and is called the cause of wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c05_1']	二、牢者，即謂修慧，既是定心，正能破障，故名牢也。	二、牢者，即謂修慧，既是定心，正能破障，故名牢也。	001	Second, being firm refers to the wisdom of cultivation. Since it is a concentrated mind, it can directly destroy obstacles, therefore it is called being firm.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c05_20']	或修慧中有有漏、無漏二別，以分細、牢；	或修慧中有有漏、無漏二別，以分細、牢；	001	Or within the wisdom of cultivation there are two distinctions of having outflows and being without outflows, which divide it into subtle and firm;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c06_17']	或就無漏中有折伏道、斷惑道，二分亦行。	或就無漏中有折伏道、斷惑道，二分亦行。	001	or within being without outflows there are two parts of the path of subduing and the path of severing delusions.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c07_17']	然煩惱障通理、事兩觀伏，以欣上厭下伏故；	然煩惱障通理、事兩觀伏，以欣上厭下伏故；	001	However, the afflictive hindrances can subdue both the principle and phenomena views, because they subdue by delighting in the higher and despising the lower;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c08_8']	所知障唯理觀伏可知也。	所知障唯理觀伏可知也。	001	the knowable hindrances only subdue the principle view, which should be known.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c11_19']	又約無間、解脫，亦分細、牢者，至佛果位解脫道中名斷者，三種斷中斷性、斷類名斷，而非斷用及斷體，以非所斷不名為斷，體已斷非正斷故，不名為能斷也。	又約無間、解脫，亦分細、牢者，至佛果位解脫道中名斷者，三種斷中斷性、斷類名斷，而非斷用及斷體，以非所斷不名為斷，體已斷非正斷故，不名為能斷也。	001	Moreover, in terms of uninterrupted and liberated, it is also divided into subtle and firm. At the stage of Buddhahood, in the path of liberation, it is called elimination. Among the three kinds of elimination, the elimination of nature and the elimination of type are called elimination, but not the function of elimination and the essence of elimination, because what is not to be eliminated is not called elimination. The essence has already been eliminated, but it is not the correct elimination, so it is not called the agent of elimination.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c13_5']	三者、闊狹義，無著論云，如彩畫金剛形，兩頭寬而腰狹。	三者、闊狹義，無著論云，如彩畫金剛形，兩頭寬而腰狹。	001	Third, the meaning of broad and narrow. The treatise of non-attachment says, Like a painted vajra, wide at both ends and narrow at the waist.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c14_12']	解云，地前、佛果喻寬，十地喻狹，以地地之中各修一行為首故；	解云，地前、佛果喻寬，十地喻狹，以地地之中各修一行為首故；	001	The explanation says, The stage before the grounds and the stage of Buddhahood are compared to being wide, and the ten grounds are compared to being narrow, because in each ground one practice is cultivated as the foremost.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c15_9', 'ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c16_5']	或七地已前分是寬，皆隨義准之。🔽應知今若所破名金剛，金剛之般若；	或七地已前分是寬，皆隨義准之。 應知今若所破名金剛，金剛之般若；	001	Or the seven grounds and below are divided into being wide, all according to the meaning.🔽It should be known that now if what is to be destroyed is called vajra, the vajra is prajñā;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c16_19']	能破摧名金剛，金剛即般若也。	能破摧名金剛，金剛即般若也。	001	That which destroys and crushes is called vajra, and the vajra is prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c17_11']	然經云般剌若者，因中慧；	然經云般剌若者，因中慧；	001	However, the sūtra says prajñā is the wisdom in the cause;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c18_9']	言薩筏若者，此云一切智，是果中智也；	言薩筏若者，此云一切智，是果中智也；	001	As for sarvajña, this means omniscience, which is the wisdom within the fruition;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c19_11']	言般剌慎若者，斷惑慧，即此中所標，故云能斷也。	言般剌慎若者，斷惑慧，即此中所標，故云能斷也。	001	As for prajñā, it is the wisdom that cuts off afflictions, which is what is referred to in the title, thus it says able to cut off.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c20_6']	論者，然今唐國有三本流行於世。	論者，然今唐國有三本流行於世。	001	As for the treatise, there are currently three versions circulating in the Tang country.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c21_3']	一、謂世親所制，翻或兩卷或三卷成。	一、謂世親所制，翻或兩卷或三卷成。	001	The first is composed by Vasubandhu, translated into two or three fascicles.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c21_18']	二、無著所造，或一卷或兩卷成。	二、無著所造，或一卷或兩卷成。	001	The second is composed by Asanga, completed in one or two fascicles.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c23_9']	三、金剛仙所造，即謂南地吳人，非真聖教也，此或十一卷或十三卷成也。	三、金剛仙所造，即謂南地吳人，非真聖教也，此或十一卷或十三卷成也。	001	The third is composed by Vajrasenā, who is said to be a person from the southern region of Wu, and is not a true holy teaching, this is completed in eleven or thirteen fascicles.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c24_5']	若唯學有以非空，妄想之心更長；	若唯學有以非空，妄想之心更長；	001	If one only studies existence and not emptiness, the deluded mind will grow longer;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c25_2']	唯學空而非有，真智無因而不生起。	唯學空而非有，真智無因而不生起。	001	If one only studies emptiness and not existence, true wisdom will not arise without a cause.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c26_2']	滅妄想於空門，起真心於有府，有空雙鏡。	滅妄想於空門，起真心於有府，有空雙鏡。	001	Destroying deluded thoughts at the gate of emptiness, giving rise to the true mind at the abode of existence, the mirror of existence and emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0125c26_8']	說教有二種：	說教有二種：	001	There are two kinds of teachings that are expounded:
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a01_2']	一、謂隨機，如四諦、二空等理；	一、謂隨機，如四諦、二空等理；	001	First, it refers to the teachings that accord with the capacities of beings, such as the four truths and the principle of the two emptinesses;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a01_18']	二、謂顯理而如，說無相、實相等。	二、謂顯理而如，說無相、實相等。	001	Second, it refers to the teachings that reveal the principle of suchness, such as the teachings on signlessness and true suchness.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a04_6']	佛以一音等，《華嚴》云如來一語中演出無邊契經海等，《法華》唯明攝入以彰一乘，《勝鬘》通據出生及攝入也。	佛以一音等，《華嚴》云如來一語中演出無邊契經海等，《法華》唯明攝入以彰一乘，《勝鬘》通據出生及攝入也。	001	The Buddha uses a single voice, as the Huayan Sutra says, The Tathagata emits the ocean of sutras without boundaries in a single word, and the Lotus Sutra only clarifies the single vehicle by revealing the inclusion, while the Shoulengyan Sutra includes both the origination and inclusion.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a05_13']	然《法華》云，若人行五波羅蜜，不及受、持、聽聞《法華》者。	然《法華》云，若人行五波羅蜜，不及受、持、聽聞《法華》者。	001	However, the Lotus Sutra says, If a person practices the five perfections, it is not as good as receiving and upholding the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a06_9']	約菩提、涅槃總名一乘，故牛車喻於菩提。	約菩提、涅槃總名一乘，故牛車喻於菩提。	001	It is based on enlightenment and nirvana and is generally called the single vehicle, so the ox-drawn cart is a metaphor for enlightenment.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a07_12']	經云，吾為汝等造作此車，故應當等心各各與之。	經云，吾為汝等造作此車，故應當等心各各與之。	001	The sutra says, I will create this cart for you, so you should give it to each of them with an impartial mind.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a08_9']	故《勝鬘》云，行六波羅蜜不及手捉經者。	故《勝鬘》云，行六波羅蜜不及手捉經者。	001	Therefore, the Shoulengyan Sutra says, Practicing the six perfections is not as good as holding the sutra in one's hand.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a09_8']	彼據真如為乘也，如彼經文具顯其相也。	彼據真如為乘也，如彼經文具顯其相也。	001	That is based on true suchness as the vehicle, as the sutra text fully reveals its characteristics.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a10_4']	如是我聞。	如是我聞。	001	Thus have I heard.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0126a10_19']	一時，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。	一時，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。	001	Once, the Buddha was at Jetavana Anāthapiṇḍada-ārāma in the country of Śrāvastī.

His meaning is as follows: When the Tathāgata first attained enlightenment, there were bodhisattvas who had already accumulated good roots in the past and whose faculties were already mature.

It means the Tathāgata is able to protect and remember for the two times of the present and future. It means that at the time of bringing present happiness, he does not allow them to do evil and attract future evil results, which is called benefit.

['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c02_13']	若約第一義諦者，真如法身內自堪寂，本無得菩提，亦無能說法。	若約第一義諦者，真如法身內自堪寂，本無得菩提，亦無能說法。	001	If based on ultimate truth, the Dharma body of suchness is inherently quiescent, originally without attaining enlightenment, and also without being able to expound the Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c03_13']	「無有定法」者，謂法身無相中，無有定法得菩提；	「無有定法」者，謂法身無相中，無有定法得菩提；	001	There is no definite Dharma means that within the signless Dharma body, there is no definite Dharma to attain enlightenment;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c04_3']	亦無定法而可說也。	亦無定法而可說也。	001	There is also no definite Dharma that can be expounded.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c05_12']	但欲無定可得、可說，不遮世諦報、化之身亦有不定得、不定說也。	但欲無定可得、可說，不遮世諦報、化之身亦有不定得、不定說也。	001	It only wishes to show that there is no definite attainment or expounding, but does not deny that in conventional truth, the bodies of retribution and transformation also have indefinite attainment and indefinite expounding.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c06_4']	「何以故？	「何以故？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c07_3']	如來所說法，皆不可取、不可說，非法、非非法。	如來所說法，皆不可取、不可說，非法、非非法。	001	The Dharma expounded by the Tathāgata is all ungraspable, inexpressible, not Dharma, not non-Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c07_11']	」述曰，此釋也。	」述曰，此釋也。	001	The commentary states: This is the explanation.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c08_3']	於中兩重展轉釋前，此初也。	於中兩重展轉釋前，此初也。	001	Within it, there are two layers of explanations, this is the first.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c08_13']	謂何以故無定法可說？	謂何以故無定法可說？	001	What is the reason? Because there is no definite dharma that can be spoken.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c09_6']	內既不可說，於外亦不可取；	內既不可說，於外亦不可取；	001	Since internally it cannot be spoken, externally it also cannot be grasped.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c10_3']	故於外若有可取，是應於內亦有可說；	故於外若有可取，是應於內亦有可說；	001	Therefore, if externally there is something that can be grasped, then internally there should also be something that can be spoken.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c10_14']	既無可取，明無可說也。	既無可取，明無可說也。	001	Since there is nothing that can be grasped, it is clear that there is nothing that can be spoken.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c11_20']	「不可說，非法、非非法」者，謂愚夫執人、法為有，名之為法；	「不可說，非法、非非法」者，謂愚夫執人、法為有，名之為法；	001	It cannot be spoken, it is neither a dharma nor a non-dharma means that foolish people grasp persons and dharmas as existent, which is called a dharma;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c12_8']	撥圓成是無，名非法。	撥圓成是無，名非法。	001	Denying the perfected nature as nonexistent is called a non-dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c13_1']	聖者達人、法為無，名為非法；	聖者達人、法為無，名為非法；	001	The sages understand persons and dharmas as nonexistent, which is called a non-dharma;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c13_12']	了圓成為有，名非非法。	了圓成為有，名非非法。	001	Comprehending the perfected nature as existent is called a non-non-dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c14_11']	法身寂淨，不可說非法，亦不可說非非法也。	法身寂淨，不可說非法，亦不可說非非法也。	001	The quiescent and pure Dharma body cannot be spoken as a non-dharma, nor can it be spoken as a non-non-dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c16_17']	故論云，「應化非真佛，亦非說法者，說法不二取，無說離言相」，應化既非真佛真說，即明亦是假佛假說也。	故論云，「應化非真佛，亦非說法者，說法不二取，無說離言相」，應化既非真佛真說，即明亦是假佛假說也。	001	Therefore the treatise says, The responsive transformations are not the true Buddha, nor are they the speaker of the Dharma. The Dharma is spoken without the two graspings, without speaking, and apart from characteristics of speech. Since the responsive transformations are not the true Buddha or the true teaching, it is clear that they are also the provisional Buddha and the provisional teaching.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c18_2']	於內既無二說，於聖者亦不二取，謂取法及非法也。	於內既無二說，於聖者亦不二取，謂取法及非法也。	001	Since there is no duality within, one also does not dualistically grasp at the noble ones, referring to grasping at dharmas and non-dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c18_13']	真理離言，無其說相故。	真理離言，無其說相故。	001	The truth of ultimate reality is beyond words, lacking any characteristics of expression.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c19_5']	何故釋中但言說，不言證？	何故釋中但言說，不言證？	001	Why does the explanation only mention speaking and not realization?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c20_7']	論云，若不證者，即不能說，故謂要先證，方能說也。	論云，若不證者，即不能說，故謂要先證，方能說也。	001	The treatise says, If one has not realized it, one cannot speak of it. Therefore, it means that one must first realize it before being able to speak of it.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c21_5']	「所以者何？	「所以者何？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c21_19']	一切賢聖皆以無為法而有差別。	一切賢聖皆以無為法而有差別。	001	All sages and worthies are distinguished by the unconditioned Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c22_8']	」述曰，此又釋前也。	」述曰，此又釋前也。	001	The commentary says, this further explains the previous point.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c24_3']	謂諸聖者皆以無分別智契證真理，方能斷惑，而立差別，故聖人說彼無為法。	謂諸聖者皆以無分別智契證真理，方能斷惑，而立差別，故聖人說彼無為法。	001	It means that all sages and worthies, by means of non-discriminating wisdom, accord with and realize the truth of ultimate reality, and are then able to sever afflictions and establish distinctions. Therefore, the sages speak of that unconditioned Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c25_2']	彼聖人所證法既不如是說，何況如是取？	彼聖人所證法既不如是說，何況如是取？	001	Since the Dharma realized by those sages is not like this in terms of speech, how much less so is it grasped in this way?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c25_6']	何以故？	何以故？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c25_19']	彼法遠離言說相，非可說故。	彼法遠離言說相，非可說故。	001	Because that Dharma is far removed from the characteristics of speech and cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c26_5']	上來世親釋竟。	上來世親釋竟。	001	The above is Vasubandhu's explanation.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0135c28_8']	無著意者，此段經文即是第四欲得法身，於中上來明得言說法身竟，此第二明欲得證得法身。	無著意者，此段經文即是第四欲得法身，於中上來明得言說法身竟，此第二明欲得證得法身。	001	The meaning of non-attachment is that this section of the sutra is the fourth, wishing to attain the Dharma body. Up to this point, it has clarified the attainment of the verbal Dharma body. This second point clarifies the desire to attain the realized Dharma body.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a01_10']	於中有二，謂一者、智相至得法身住處，謂無分別智能契得真如法身，即以智相為住處也；	於中有二，謂一者、智相至得法身住處，謂無分別智能契得真如法身，即以智相為住處也；	001	Within this, there are two parts: first, the attainment of the Dharma body characterized by wisdom, which refers to the non-discriminating cognition that can accord with true suchness and the Dharma body, and takes the characteristics of wisdom as the abode;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a02_7']	二者、福相至得法身住處，此明初也。	二者、福相至得法身住處，此明初也。	001	second, the attainment of the Dharma body characterized by merit, which clarifies the first of these.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a03_6']	謂前欲得色身，佛言色身虛妄，教求法身；	謂前欲得色身，佛言色身虛妄，教求法身；	001	This refers to the previous desire to attain the form body. The Buddha said that the form body is false and taught to seek the Dharma body.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a04_9']	欲求法身，先修諸真之智，即是菩提法身，故名智相。	欲求法身，先修諸真之智，即是菩提法身，故名智相。	001	In order to seek the Dharma body, one first cultivates the true wisdom, which is the bodhi Dharma body, and is therefore called the characteristics of wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a06_10']	由求智相法身故，佛以真如法身為問，謂外事中而有執他可得菩提，隨眾生機有可說法；	由求智相法身故，佛以真如法身為問，謂外事中而有執他可得菩提，隨眾生機有可說法；	001	Because of seeking the Dharma body characterized by wisdom, the Buddha takes true suchness and the Dharma body as the question, saying that within external matters there is the grasping of others who can attain bodhi, and there is the Dharma that can be taught according to the capacities of sentient beings;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a08_2']	於內無相法身之中，本無智身菩提可得，亦無法而可說，故以為問也。	於內無相法身之中，本無智身菩提可得，亦無法而可說，故以為問也。	001	Within the Dharma body of the inner signlessness, there is originally no wisdom body bodhi that can be attained, nor is there any Dharma that can be spoken, and thus it is asked.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a09_6']	善現答言義亦同，然解佛意故約真如理彼二俱無也。	善現答言義亦同，然解佛意故約真如理彼二俱無也。	001	Subhūti's answer is also the same in meaning, but he understands the Buddha's intention and thus in terms of true suchness, both are non-existent.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a10_11']	謂於內真如理不可說非法非非法，故即無說無取也；	謂於內真如理不可說非法非非法，故即無說無取也；	001	That is to say, in the principle of inner true suchness, it cannot be said to be Dharma or non-Dharma, and thus there is no speaking and no grasping;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a11_11']	於外聽者，依真如理不可取故，無聞無得也。	於外聽者，依真如理不可取故，無聞無得也。	001	In the external listener, because of the principle of true suchness, it cannot be grasped, and thus there is no hearing and no attainment.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a12_2']	此即說、聽皆依真如也。	此即說、聽皆依真如也。	001	This then says that both speaking and listening rely on true suchness.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a13_10']	世親釋意說證真如，故不說法、非法，聽離妄執故不取法、非法。	世親釋意說證真如，故不說法、非法，聽離妄執故不取法、非法。	001	Vasubandhu's interpretation means that because one realizes true suchness, one does not speak of Dharma or non-Dharma, and the listener is free from false grasping, thus not grasping Dharma or non-Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a14_2']	謂法者，所執人、法為有故；	謂法者，所執人、法為有故；	001	That is to say, Dharma refers to the person and dharmas that are grasped as existent;
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a14_15']	非法者，所撥圓成為空故也。	非法者，所撥圓成為空故也。	001	Non-Dharma refers to the negation of the perfected nature as empty.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a15_9']	依等五義配文者，如論自顯也。	依等五義配文者，如論自顯也。	001	As for matching the text with the five meanings such as reliance, it is as it appears in the treatise itself.

['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a19_5']	」述曰，依世親釋，初校量之中上來三段釋疑，自下正校量也。	」述曰，依世親釋，初校量之中上來三段釋疑，自下正校量也。	001	The commentary says: According to Vasubandhu's explanation, in the first comparison, the first three sections resolve doubts, and from here on is the main comparison.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a21_1']	外意云真理之中既無說無取，無菩薩而可得者，所行無相之福，豈不空施耶？	外意云真理之中既無說無取，無菩薩而可得者，所行無相之福，豈不空施耶？	001	The outsider's idea is: since in ultimate truth there is no speaking, no grasping, and no bodhisattvas to be found, would the merit of practicing the signless not be an empty offering?
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a21_12']	世尊挾此意故問善現也。	世尊挾此意故問善現也。	001	The World-Honored One, grasping this idea, asked Subhūti.

['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a25_23']	言「是福」者，謂舉財施福德。	言「是福」者，謂舉財施福德。	001	This is merit refers to the merit of giving wealth.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a27_17']	「即非福德性」者，謂非是感出世之福德性也，謂要聽聞發生無分別智，方得出世無相果故。	「即非福德性」者，謂非是感出世之福德性也，謂要聽聞發生無分別智，方得出世無相果故。	001	It is not the nature of merit means it is not the nature of merit that can lead to the supramundane. It means that only by listening and giving rise to non-discriminating wisdom can one attain the signless fruit of the supramundane.
['ZH_T33_1700_001:0136a29_8']	「是故如來說福德多」者，謂是故如來說，此財施福能感世間福德多。	「是故如來說福德多」者，謂是故如來說，此財施福能感世間福德多。	001	Therefore, the Tathāgata says the merit is great means that the Tathāgata says that the merit of giving wealth can lead to much worldly merit.

This means that sentient beings lack skillful means in grasping form bodies and name bodies, so they form a single combined appearance.
