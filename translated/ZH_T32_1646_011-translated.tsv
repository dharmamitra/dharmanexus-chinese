['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323a17_6']	十煩惱大地法，所謂不信、懈怠、忘憶、散心、無明、邪方便、邪念、邪解、戲調、放逸，是法常與一切煩惱心俱。	十煩惱大地法，所謂不信、懈怠、忘憶、散心、無明、邪方便、邪念、邪解、戲調、放逸，是法常與一切煩惱心俱。	011	The ten afflictions and the ten universal mental factors, namely, lack of faith, laziness, forgetfulness, distracted mind, ignorance, wrong skillful means, wrong mindfulness, wrong understanding, frivolity, and negligence, these dharmas are always concomitant with all defiled minds.

['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c04_11']	如尼延子等見佛弟子得供養，故生嫉妬心，是嫉妬見道則滅，故知見諦所斷。	如尼延子等見佛弟子得供養，故生嫉妬心，是嫉妬見道則滅，故知見諦所斷。	011	For example, when the son of Nyagrodha sees the disciples of the Buddha receiving offerings, he gives rise to jealousy. This jealousy is extinguished by seeing the path, so we know it is eliminated by seeing the truth.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c06_3']	有人先於佛弟子慳惜不施，得見道故便能施與，是慳則見諦斷。	有人先於佛弟子慳惜不施，得見道故便能施與，是慳則見諦斷。	011	There are those who are stingy and do not give to the disciples of the Buddha, but because they see the path they are able to give. This stinginess is eliminated by seeing the truth.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c06_16']	如蘇那剎多羅等悔亦見諦斷。	如蘇那剎多羅等悔亦見諦斷。	011	For example, like Sunaksatra and others, regret is also eliminated by seeing the truth.

['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c10_14']	先說見諦所斷六使四種，見苦斷見集滅道斷；	先說見諦所斷六使四種，見苦斷見集滅道斷；	011	It was previously explained that the six afflictions eliminated by seeing the truths are of four kinds: eliminated by seeing suffering, origination, cessation, and the path.

['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c12_6']	戒取二種，見苦、見道斷。	戒取二種，見苦、見道斷。	011	Grasping at precepts and observances is of two kinds, eliminated by seeing suffering and by seeing the path.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c12_11']	是事云何？	是事云何？	011	How is this?
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c12_14']	答曰：	答曰：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c13_16']	諸煩惱實見滅諦時斷，是故身見等不應但見苦斷。	諸煩惱實見滅諦時斷，是故身見等不應但見苦斷。	011	In reality, all afflictions are eliminated when the truth of cessation is seen. Therefore, the view of self and so forth should not be only eliminated by seeing suffering.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c15_16']	又身見於四諦中謬，五陰無常從因緣生，我非無常不從因生，五陰有滅而我無滅。	又身見於四諦中謬，五陰無常從因緣生，我非無常不從因生，五陰有滅而我無滅。	011	Moreover, the view of self errs regarding the four truths. The five aggregates are impermanent and arise from causes and conditions. The self is not impermanent and does not arise from causes. The five aggregates have cessation, but the self has no cessation.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c16_15']	道與我見相違，是故身見四種所斷。	道與我見相違，是故身見四種所斷。	011	The path contradicts the view of self. Therefore, the view of self is eliminated by the four kinds [of truths].
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c17_4']	邊見亦四種斷。	邊見亦四種斷。	011	Extreme views are also eliminated by the four kinds.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c17_9']	所以者何？	所以者何？	011	Why is this?
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c18_13']	行者見苦從集生則滅斷見，見由道得滅則滅常見。	行者見苦從集生則滅斷見，見由道得滅則滅常見。	011	When practitioners see suffering arising from origination, they eliminate the view of annihilation. Seeing cessation attained through the path, they eliminate the view of permanence.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c20_8']	戒取亦四種，有因有果是故見苦時，知戒是苦不以此得淨，是見苦斷；	戒取亦四種，有因有果是故見苦時，知戒是苦不以此得淨，是見苦斷；	011	Attachment to precepts also has four kinds. Because it has causes and effects, when seeing suffering, one knows that precepts are suffering and cannot attain purity through them, which is eliminated by seeing suffering.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c21_7']	知戒是苦因不以此得淨，是見集斷；	知戒是苦因不以此得淨，是見集斷；	011	One knows that precepts are the cause of suffering and cannot attain purity through them, which is eliminated by seeing the accumulation [of causes].
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c22_8']	以邪見謗泥洹謂以此見得淨，是見滅斷；	以邪見謗泥洹謂以此見得淨，是見滅斷；	011	Slandering nirvana with wrong views, thinking that attaining purity through this view, is eliminated by seeing cessation.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0323c23_16']	以此謗道是見道斷，如見取依邪見故四種，戒取亦應如是。	以此謗道是見道斷，如見取依邪見故四種，戒取亦應如是。	011	Slandering the path through this, is eliminated by seeing the path. Just as attachment to views has four kinds based on wrong views, attachment to precepts should also be like this.

Due to this grasping, the other three graspings arise. Grasping is a condition for becoming, and becoming is a condition for birth. Therefore, we know that afflictions are the root of the body.

In this suffering body, one gives rise to the inverted thought of pleasure. Due to this inverted pleasure, inverted craving arises.

Due to loving sexual desire, there is birth from eggs and birth from wombs. Craving for smells, tastes, and so forth leads to birth from moisture. According to what is loved, one gives rise to earnest and heavy karma and then receives spontaneous birth. Therefore, we know that the distinctions in the four kinds of birth are all due to greed and love.

The consciousness of form abides following form, relying on form, taking form as its object, and is moistened by joy. Feeling, perception, and mental formations are also like this. But consciousness is not said to be the base of consciousness, because when there is consciousness, there are no afflictions.

Based on consciousness, name-and-form, the six sense bases, contact, and feeling arise. These four are the fruits of karmic afflictions in past lives. Again, based on this craving, craving, grasping, and becoming arise. These karmic afflictions are able to give rise to birth, old age, and death in the next life and so forth.

['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332a25_4']	所以者何？	所以者何？	011	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332a26_4']	我先說，若一切無，是論亦無，亦不在諸法中。	我先說，若一切無，是論亦無，亦不在諸法中。	011	I have previously said that if everything is non-existent, this treatise also does not exist, and it is not in the dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332a27_10']	如是等破空，汝竟不答，猶故立空，是故非無一切諸法。	如是等破空，汝竟不答，猶故立空，是故非無一切諸法。	011	In this way, you have not answered the refutation of emptiness, and you still establish emptiness. Therefore, it is not the case that all dharmas are non-existent.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332a28_10']	又汝所說無根無緣等，是事非我等所明。	又汝所說無根無緣等，是事非我等所明。	011	Moreover, what you said about being without basis and without conditions, this matter is not what we clarify.

['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b01_15']	佛經中自遮此事，謂五事不可思議，世間事、眾生事、業因緣事、坐禪人事、諸佛事。	佛經中自遮此事，謂五事不可思議，世間事、眾生事、業因緣事、坐禪人事、諸佛事。	011	The Buddha's sutras themselves prohibit this matter, namely, the five things that cannot be contemplated: worldly matters, sentient beings' matters, karmic causes and conditions, matters concerning meditation, and matters concerning the buddhas.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b03_1']	是事非一切智人不能思量決斷，但諸佛有能分別法智。	是事非一切智人不能思量決斷，但諸佛有能分別法智。	011	These matters are not something that a person without omniscience cannot contemplate and decide, but only the buddhas are able to discern the wisdom of the Dharma.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b04_9']	聲聞辟支佛但有通達泥洹智慧，於分別諸法智中但得少分。	聲聞辟支佛但有通達泥洹智慧，於分別諸法智中但得少分。	011	The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas only have the wisdom of penetrating nirvāṇa, and within the wisdom of discerning the various dharmas, they only attain a small portion.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b05_14']	諸佛於一切法一切種本末體性總相別相皆能通達。	諸佛於一切法一切種本末體性總相別相皆能通達。	011	The buddhas are able to penetrate all dharmas, all their categories, their fundamental and derivative natures, their general and specific characteristics.

['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b09_16']	佛雖說一切法，不說一切種，以不為解脫故。	佛雖說一切法，不說一切種，以不為解脫故。	011	Although the Buddha taught all dharmas, he did not teach all their aspects, because it is not for the sake of liberation.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b11_10']	如佛說諸法從因緣生，不說一一所從因緣，但說要用能滅苦者。	如佛說諸法從因緣生，不說一一所從因緣，但說要用能滅苦者。	011	As the Buddha taught that all dharmas arise from causes and conditions, he did not teach the causes and conditions for each one, but only taught what is essential to extinguish suffering.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b14_1']	彩畫等諸色、伎樂等諸音、諸香味觸無量差別不可盡說，若說亦無大利，故佛不說如是等事，不得言無。	彩畫等諸色、伎樂等諸音、諸香味觸無量差別不可盡說，若說亦無大利，故佛不說如是等事，不得言無。	011	The countless distinctions in painted colors, musical sounds, tastes, smells, and tactile objects cannot be exhaustively taught. Even if taught, they are of little benefit, so the Buddha did not teach such things. It cannot be said that they do not exist.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b15_1']	又如人不知分別彩畫等法，便言其無。	又如人不知分別彩畫等法，便言其無。	011	It is like a person who does not know how to distinguish painted colors and so on, and says they do not exist.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b15_16']	汝亦如是，所不能成事而便說無。	汝亦如是，所不能成事而便說無。	011	You are also like this. You say things do not exist because you cannot accomplish them.

['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b19_3']	不可以不見故便無諸色，如是若不能以自緣成故，便言無一切法。	不可以不見故便無諸色，如是若不能以自緣成故，便言無一切法。	011	One cannot say there are no forms simply because one cannot see them. In the same way, one cannot say all dharmas do not exist simply because one cannot establish them through one's own conditions.
['ZH_T32_1646_011:0332b21_4']	又諸佛世尊一切智人我等所信，佛說有五陰，故知色等一切法有，如瓶等以世諦故有。	又諸佛世尊一切智人我等所信，佛說有五陰，故知色等一切法有，如瓶等以世諦故有。	011	Moreover, the omniscient Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, are what we believe in. The Buddha said there are five aggregates, so we know form and all other dharmas exist, like a vase, which exists in the conventional truth.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
