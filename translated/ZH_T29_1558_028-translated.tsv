['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145a26_2']	一切功德多依靜慮，故應先辯靜慮差別。	一切功德多依靜慮，故應先辯靜慮差別。	028	Since all merits mostly rely on dhyāna, therefore one should first explain the distinctions of dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145a27_4']	此總有四種，謂初二三四，四各有二，謂定及生。	此總有四種，謂初二三四，四各有二，謂定及生。	028	In total there are four kinds, namely the first, second, third, and fourth. Each of the four has two, namely concentration and arising.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145a28_3']	生靜慮體世品已說，謂第四八，前三各三。	生靜慮體世品已說，謂第四八，前三各三。	028	The essence of the dhyāna of arising has already been explained in the chapter on the worlds, namely the fourth has eight, and the first three each have three.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145a29_11']	定靜慮體總而言之是善性攝心一境性，以善等持為自性故；	定靜慮體總而言之是善性攝心一境性，以善等持為自性故；	028	In general, the substance of samādhi is the concentration of good mind, because its nature is that of good samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b01_2']	若并助伴，五蘊為性。	若并助伴，五蘊為性。	028	If it is considered with its auxiliaries, it has the five aggregates as its substance.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b01_8']	何名一境性？	何名一境性？	028	What is meant by “the concentration of mind on one object?”
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b01_14']	謂專一所緣。	謂專一所緣。	028	It means the concentration of mind on a single object.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b03_5']	若爾，即心專一境位，依之建立三摩地名，不應別有餘心所法。	若爾，即心專一境位，依之建立三摩地名，不應別有餘心所法。	028	If this is so, then the name samādhi is established on the basis of the state in which mind is concentrated on a single object, and there should be no other mental activities besides this.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b04_6']	別法令心於一境轉名三摩地，非體即心。	別法令心於一境轉名三摩地，非體即心。	028	There is a separate dharma that causes mind to be concentrated on a single object and is called samādhi. Its substance is not mind itself.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b05_6']	豈不諸心剎那滅故皆一境轉，何用等持？	豈不諸心剎那滅故皆一境轉，何用等持？	028	Is it not the case that all minds are concentrated on a single object because they perish from moment to moment? What use is there for samādhi?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b06_14']	若謂令心於第二念不散亂故須有等持，則於相應等持無用。	若謂令心於第二念不散亂故須有等持，則於相應等持無用。	028	If it is said that samādhi is necessary in order to prevent mind from becoming distracted in the second moment, then samādhi is useless with regard to the associated dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b07_6']	又由此故三摩地成。	又由此故三摩地成。	028	Moreover, it is on the basis of this samādhi that samādhi is accomplished.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b07_17']	寧不即由斯心於一境轉？	寧不即由斯心於一境轉？	028	Why does mind not concentrate on a single object on the basis of this mind itself?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b08_17']	又三摩地是大地法，應一切心皆一境轉。	又三摩地是大地法，應一切心皆一境轉。	028	Moreover, samādhi is a universal dharma and should cause all minds to concentrate on a single object.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b09_8']	不爾，餘品等持劣故。	不爾，餘品等持劣故。	028	This is not so, because in other classes of mind, samādhi is weak.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b09_13']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	028	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b11_10']	即心一境相續轉時名三摩地，契經說此為增上心學故，心清淨最勝即四靜慮故。	即心一境相續轉時名三摩地，契經說此為增上心學故，心清淨最勝即四靜慮故。	028	When mind is in a state of concentration and continuity, this is called samādhi, because the scriptures say that it is the training in the higher mind, and because the most excellent purity of mind is the four meditations.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b12_2']	依何義故立靜慮名？	依何義故立靜慮名？	028	On the basis of what meaning is samādhi called meditation?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b12_11']	由此寂靜能審慮故。	由此寂靜能審慮故。	028	Because it is quiet and still and able to reflect and consider.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b14_3']	審慮即是實了知義，如說心在定，能如實了知，審慮義中置地界故。	審慮即是實了知義，如說心在定，能如實了知，審慮義中置地界故。	028	Reflection and consideration have the meaning of true knowledge, as when it is said that when the mind is in samādhi, it is able to know things as they really are. The meaning of reflection and consideration is to place the meaning of earth.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b14_12']	此宗審慮以慧為體。	此宗審慮以慧為體。	028	This school holds that reflection and consideration have wisdom as their substance.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b15_5']	若爾，諸等持皆應名靜慮。	若爾，諸等持皆應名靜慮。	028	In that case, all samādhis should be called meditation.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b15_15']	不爾，唯勝方立此名。	不爾，唯勝方立此名。	028	No, only the superior are given this name.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b16_14']	如世間言發光名日，非螢燭等亦得日名。	如世間言發光名日，非螢燭等亦得日名。	028	It is like the worldly saying that that which emits light is called the sun, and that fireflies and candles are not also called the sun.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b17_5']	靜慮如何獨名為勝？	靜慮如何獨名為勝？	028	How is meditation superior?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b19_5']	諸等持內唯此攝支，止觀均行最能審慮，得現法樂住及樂通行名，故此等持獨名靜慮。	諸等持內唯此攝支，止觀均行最能審慮，得現法樂住及樂通行名，故此等持獨名靜慮。	028	Only this meditation includes the members of the path, and the practice of calm and contemplation is most able to reflect and consider. It obtains the name of abiding in bliss in the present life and of the path of bliss. Therefore, this samādhi alone is called meditation.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b19_15']	若爾，染污寧得此名？	若爾，染污寧得此名？	028	If this is so, how can defiled states be called meditative development?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b20_14']	由彼亦能邪審慮故，是則應有太過之失。	由彼亦能邪審慮故，是則應有太過之失。	028	Because they also wrongly investigate. In that case, there would be the fault of over-extension.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b21_15']	無太過失，要相似中方立名故，如敗種等。	無太過失，要相似中方立名故，如敗種等。	028	There is no fault of over-extension, because the name is established only in a similar case, just as a bad seed, etc.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b22_5']	世尊亦說有惡靜慮。	世尊亦說有惡靜慮。	028	The World-Honored One also says that there is evil meditative concentration.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b23_5']	若一境性是靜慮體，依何相立初二三四？	若一境性是靜慮體，依何相立初二三四？	028	If one-pointedness of mind is the essence of meditative concentration, on what basis are the first, second, third, and fourth [meditative concentrations] established?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b24_15']	具伺喜樂建立為初，由此已明亦具尋義，必俱行故，如煙與火。	具伺喜樂建立為初，由此已明亦具尋義，必俱行故，如煙與火。	028	It is established as the first [meditative concentration] because it is endowed with applied thought, sustained thought, joy, and pleasure. By this, it is already clear that it also has initial thought, because they necessarily occur together, just as smoke and fire do.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b25_9']	非伺有喜樂，而不與尋俱。	非伺有喜樂，而不與尋俱。	028	It is not that there is joy and pleasure without being accompanied by initial thought.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b26_16']	漸離前支立二三四，離伺有二，離二有樂，具離三種。	漸離前支立二三四，離伺有二，離二有樂，具離三種。	028	The second, third, and fourth [meditative concentrations] are established by gradually abandoning the previous factors. There are two [meditative concentrations] that abandon applied thought, two that abandon sustained thought, and one that abandonly abandons all three.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b27_11']	如其次第，故一境性分為四種。	如其次第，故一境性分為四種。	028	One-pointedness of mind is divided into four kinds in this order.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b27_16']	已辯靜慮。	已辯靜慮。	028	Meditative concentration has already been discussed.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b28_2']	無色云何？	無色云何？	028	What about the formless [absorptions]?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b28_5']	頌曰：	頌曰：	028	The verse states:
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145b29_0']	無色亦如是，　　四蘊離下地，	無色亦如是，　　四蘊離下地，	028	The formless [absorptions] are also like this, with four aggregates abandoning the lower stages,
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c01_0']	并上三近分，　　總名除色想，	并上三近分，　　總名除色想，	028	Together with the three proximate [absorptions], they are collectively called the elimination of the notion of form.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c02_13']	無色謂無色，　　後色起從心。	無色謂無色，　　後色起從心。	028	The formless [absorptions] are called formless because there is no form [in them]. The arising of form [in the formless realm] comes from the mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c03_0']	空無邊等三，　　名從加行立，	空無邊等三，　　名從加行立，	028	The three [absorptions] beginning with infinite space are named according to their preparatory practice.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c04_13']	非想非非想，　　昧劣故立名。	非想非非想，　　昧劣故立名。	028	The [absorption] of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is named because it is dull and inferior.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c05_2']	論曰：	論曰：	028	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c05_16']	此與靜慮數自性同，謂四各二。	此與靜慮數自性同，謂四各二。	028	The number of these [formless absorptions] is the same as the nature of the dhyānas, namely, each has two [types].
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c06_11']	生如前說，即世品說由生有四。	生如前說，即世品說由生有四。	028	The birth [in the formless realm] is as explained above. The same treatise [i.e., the Compendium of the Great Vehicle] says that there are four [types of birth] due to birth.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c07_10']	定無色體，總而言之亦善性攝心一境性。	定無色體，總而言之亦善性攝心一境性。	028	The essence of the formless absorptions, in general, is also categorized as the wholesome nature of one-pointedness of mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c08_2']	依此故說亦如是言。	依此故說亦如是言。	028	Based on this, it says the same is true [for the formless absorptions].
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c09_2']	然助伴中此除色蘊，無色無有隨轉色故。	然助伴中此除色蘊，無色無有隨轉色故。	028	However, in their accompanying factors, these [formless absorptions] exclude the form aggregate, because there is no form that accompanies [the formless absorptions].
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c10_2']	雖一境性體相無差，離下地生故分四種。	雖一境性體相無差，離下地生故分四種。	028	Although the nature of one-pointedness of mind is without distinction in essence, it is divided into four types because [the formless absorptions] are separated from the birth in the lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c11_16']	謂若已離第四靜慮生立空無邊處，乃至已離無所有處生立非想非非想處。	謂若已離第四靜慮生立空無邊處，乃至已離無所有處生立非想非非想處。	028	That is to say, if one is separated from the birth in the fourth dhyāna, one establishes the sphere of infinite space, and so on up to if one is separated from the birth in the sphere of nothingness, one establishes the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c12_4']	離名何義？	離名何義？	028	What is the meaning of separation?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c13_2']	謂由此道解脫下地惑，是離下染義。	謂由此道解脫下地惑，是離下染義。	028	That is, the path by which one is liberated from the passions of a lower stage is the meaning of “free from the passions of a lower stage.”
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c14_3']	即此四根本并上三近分，總說名為除去色想。	即此四根本并上三近分，總說名為除去色想。	028	These four fundamental and three proximate stages are all called “the elimination of the notion of form.”
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c15_3']	空處近分未得此名，緣下地色起色想故。	空處近分未得此名，緣下地色起色想故。	028	The preliminary stage of the sphere of unlimited space is not yet given this name, because it generates the notion of form of a lower stage.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c16_3']	皆無色故立無色名，此因不成，許有色故。	皆無色故立無色名，此因不成，許有色故。	028	They are all called formless because they are formless, but this reason is not established, because they are admitted to have form.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c16_13']	若爾，何故立無色名？	若爾，何故立無色名？	028	If this is so, why are they called formless?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c17_12']	由彼色微故名無色，如微黃物亦名無黃。	由彼色微故名無色，如微黃物亦名無黃。	028	They are called formless because their form is subtle, just as a very yellow thing is called formless.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c18_3']	許彼界中色有何相？	許彼界中色有何相？	028	What are the characteristics of the form that is admitted in that realm?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c18_12']	若彼唯有身語律儀。	若彼唯有身語律儀。	028	If they only have the morality of body and speech,
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c19_3']	身語既無，律儀寧有？	身語既無，律儀寧有？	028	how can there be morality if there is no body or speech?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c19_13']	又無大種，何有造色？	又無大種，何有造色？	028	Moreover, if there is no primary element, how can there be derivative form?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c20_3']	若謂如有無漏律儀。	若謂如有無漏律儀。	028	If you say that it is like pure morality,
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c21_5']	不爾，無漏依有漏大種故，又彼定中亦遮有故。	不爾，無漏依有漏大種故，又彼定中亦遮有故。	028	this is not so, because pure morality is based on impure primary elements, and also because the existence of form is denied in those samādhis.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c22_5']	若許於彼有色根身，如何可言彼色微少？	若許於彼有色根身，如何可言彼色微少？	028	If you admit that there is a body with material organs in those states, how can you say that the form is subtle?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c23_16']	若謂於彼身量小故，水細蟲極微亦應名無色，亦身量小不可見故。	若謂於彼身量小故，水細蟲極微亦應名無色，亦身量小不可見故。	028	If you say that they are called formless because their bodies are small, then water animals and atoms should also be called formless, because their bodies are also small and invisible.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c24_16']	若謂彼身極清妙故，中有色界應名無色。	若謂彼身極清妙故，中有色界應名無色。	028	If you say that they are called formless because their bodies are extremely clear and subtle, then the form of the realm of form should be called formless.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c25_16']	若謂彼身清妙中極，應唯有頂得無色名。	若謂彼身清妙中極，應唯有頂得無色名。	028	If you say that they are called formless because their bodies are the most clear and subtle, then only the summit of existence should be called formless.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c27_16']	如定生身有勝劣故，又生靜慮所有色身非下地根所能取故，與彼何異不名無色？	如定生身有勝劣故，又生靜慮所有色身非下地根所能取故，與彼何異不名無色？	028	Because the bodies born in the formless realm are superior and inferior, and because the bodies born in the heavens of the meditations cannot be grasped by the organs of lower stages, how are they different from the formless realm and not called formless?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c28_12']	若謂欲色隨義立名，無色不然。	若謂欲色隨義立名，無色不然。	028	If you say that the names of the realms of desire and form are established according to their meanings, but not so for the formless,
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0145c28_17']	此有何理？	此有何理？	028	what is the reason for this?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0146a03_5']	若謂經說壽煖合故，又說名色與識相依如二蘆束相依住故，又說名色識為緣故，又遮離色乃至離行識有來有去故，由此無色有色理成。	若謂經說壽煖合故，又說名色與識相依如二蘆束相依住故，又說名色識為緣故，又遮離色乃至離行識有來有去故，由此無色有色理成。	028	If you say that the scriptures say that life and heat are united, and that name-and-form and consciousness support each other like two bundles of reeds standing by mutual support, and that name-and-form have consciousness as a condition, and that consciousness comes and goes in dependence on name-and-form, and that consciousness comes and goes in dependence on name-and-form, and that consciousness comes and goes in dependence on form, etc., up to consciousness coming and going in dependence on conceptualization, and that therefore the formless realm has form,
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0146a03_15']	此證不成，應審思故。	此證不成，應審思故。	028	this proof is not established, because it must be carefully considered.
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0146a05_8']	謂所引教應共審思，且契經言壽煖合者，為約一切界、為約欲界說？	謂所引教應共審思，且契經言壽煖合者，為約一切界、為約欲界說？	028	That is, we should carefully consider the scriptures that are cited. The scriptures say that life and heat are united. Do they refer to all realms or only the desire realm?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0146a06_10']	名色與識相依住者，為約一切界、為約欲色說？	名色與識相依住者，為約一切界、為約欲色說？	028	Name-and-form and consciousness abide in mutual dependence. Do they refer to all realms or only the desire and form realms?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0146a08_5']	所說名色識為緣者，為說一切識皆為名色緣、為說名色生無不緣於識？	所說名色識為緣者，為說一切識皆為名色緣、為說名色生無不緣於識？	028	The scriptures say that name-and-form are conditioned by consciousness. Do they mean that all consciousness is a condition for name-and-form, or that there is no arising of name-and-form that is not conditioned by consciousness?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0146a09_11']	遮離色至行識有來去者，為遮隨離一、為遮離一切？	遮離色至行識有來去者，為遮隨離一、為遮離一切？	028	The scriptures say that consciousness comes and goes when separated from form, etc., up to and including volitions. Do they mean that it comes and goes when separated from any one of these, or that it comes and goes when separated from all of them?
['ZH_T29_1558_028:0146a10_12']	若謂契經言無簡別，不應於此更致審思。	若謂契經言無簡別，不應於此更致審思。	028	If you say that the scriptures do not distinguish among them, then we should not think about this any further.
