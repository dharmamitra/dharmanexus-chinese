['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a16_8']	二、別起因。	二、別起因。	001	Second, the specific causes.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a16_20']	通謂通諸經，別謂局此教。	通謂通諸經，別謂局此教。	001	Universal refers to all sutras, specific refers to this teaching alone.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a18_13']	初通因者，夫一切如來離諸分別，心證定海、智等如如，物我俱亡、形聲雙寂。	初通因者，夫一切如來離諸分別，心證定海、智等如如，物我俱亡、形聲雙寂。	001	As for the first universal cause, all Tathagatas are free from all discrimination, their minds realizing the ocean of samādhi and wisdom equal to suchness, with self and others both gone, form and sound both silent.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a20_9']	然因修宿願任感機緣，若圓鏡之現形、等虛巖之發響，故有應化垂迹，振隨類音。	然因修宿願任感機緣，若圓鏡之現形、等虛巖之發響，故有應化垂迹，振隨類音。	001	However, due to cultivating past vows and responding to the capacities of sentient beings, like a perfect mirror reflecting forms or an empty valley producing echoes, thus there are manifestations of transformation, displaying sounds according to different types.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a20_19']	教雖萬差，起緣唯二：	教雖萬差，起緣唯二：	001	Although the teachings differ in myriad ways, the causes for their arising are only two:
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a21_16']	一由如來大悲所流、二由有情性欲所感。	一由如來大悲所流、二由有情性欲所感。	001	First, flowing from the great compassion of the Tathagata; second, responding to the inherent desires of sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a22_7']	然諸教中，隨舉不定。	然諸教中，隨舉不定。	001	However, among the various teachings, the specific causes are not always mentioned.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a24_11']	如《無量義經》但舉由生性欲所感，故彼經云「法無量者，以諸眾生性欲無量教，其所說法亦復無量。	如《無量義經》但舉由生性欲所感，故彼經云「法無量者，以諸眾生性欲無量教，其所說法亦復無量。	001	For example, the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings only mentions the causes for arising that respond to the inherent desires of sentient beings, thus the sutra says, As for the immeasurable Dharma, it is because the inherent desires of sentient beings are immeasurable, and the teachings expounded are also immeasurable.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a25_19']	」《法華經》第一云「我今亦復如是，知諸眾生有種種欲，深心所著。	」《法華經》第一云「我今亦復如是，知諸眾生有種種欲，深心所著。	001	The first chapter of the Lotus Sutra says, I am also like this now. I know that sentient beings have various desires and are deeply attached to them.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a27_4']	隨其本性，以種種因緣譬喻言辭，方便力故而為說法。	隨其本性，以種種因緣譬喻言辭，方便力故而為說法。	001	According to their fundamental natures, I use various causes, conditions, parables, and expedient means to expound the Dharma for them.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a28_10']	」此經〈夢見懺悔品〉云「住壽不可思議劫，隨機說法利群生。	」此經〈夢見懺悔品〉云「住壽不可思議劫，隨機說法利群生。	001	This sutra's chapter on Repentance in a Dream says, Abiding for an inconceivable number of kalpas, expounding the Dharma according to capacities and benefiting the multitude of beings.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175a29_14']	」天親《攝論》云且約由悲，云「大悲所流十二部經」。	」天親《攝論》云且約由悲，云「大悲所流十二部經」。	001	Vasubandhu's *Mahāyūānasamgrahabhāṣya says, For now, it is said that the twelve divisions of the canon flow from great compassion.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b01_14']	無性《攝論》即約機性，云「自善根力識心所起」。	無性《攝論》即約機性，云「自善根力識心所起」。	001	Asvabhāva's *Mahāyūānasamgrahopanibandhana says, It arises from the power of one's own wholesome roots and consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b02_17']	《二十唯識》合說起因，頌云「展轉增上力，二識成決定。	《二十唯識》合說起因，頌云「展轉增上力，二識成決定。	001	The *Vimśatikā says, The power of mutual supremacy, the two consciousnesses become definite.

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b03_16']	謂餘相續識差別故，令餘差別相續識生。	謂餘相續識差別故，令餘差別相續識生。	001	It means that because the consciousnesses of other continuums are differentiated, it causes the consciousnesses of other differentiated continuums to arise.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b05_10']	此言相續者身，差別者教，此意由佛身識現名句義，令聞者識名句義生。	此言相續者身，差別者教，此意由佛身識現名句義，令聞者識名句義生。	001	The term continuum refers to the body, and distinction refers to the teachings. This means that the meaning of names and phrases is manifested by the Buddha's body-consciousness, causing the consciousness of the listeners to give rise to the meaning of names and phrases.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b06_16']	此由生根熟為能感，如來大悲為能應，多據大悲利他所以。	此由生根熟為能感，如來大悲為能應，多據大悲利他所以。	001	This is caused by the ripening of the faculties of sentient beings, with the Tathāgata's great compassion as the response. It is based mainly on the great compassion that benefits others.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b07_2']	又有二緣：	又有二緣：	001	There are also two conditions:
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b07_15']	一為法久住、二為利有情故。	一為法久住、二為利有情故。	001	First, for the sake of the long-lasting of the Dharma, and second, for the sake of benefiting sentient beings.

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b10_8']	開悟眾生，為利有情，是大悲。	開悟眾生，為利有情，是大悲。	001	Awakening sentient beings is for the sake of benefiting sentient beings, which is great compassion.

The chapter on repentance says, Abiding in life for an inconceivable kalpa, teaching the Dharma according to the capacities of sentient beings and benefiting the multitude of beings.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b13_8']	」大悲，如〈付屬品〉云「汝等誰能發心守護廣宣流布，能令正法久住世間大智也。	」大悲，如〈付屬品〉云「汝等誰能發心守護廣宣流布，能令正法久住世間大智也。	001	Great compassion is as stated in the Entrustment Chapter: Who among you is able to arouse the mind to protect and widely disseminate, able to cause the true Dharma to abide in the world for a long time, you of great wisdom?
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b14_6']	」或可令法久住意利有情，為大悲也。	」或可令法久住意利有情，為大悲也。	001	Or it may mean that the intention to benefit sentient beings is great compassion, in order to cause the Dharma to abide for a long time.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b15_2']	或可利益群生令法久住，為大智也。	或可利益群生令法久住，為大智也。	001	Or it may mean that benefiting the multitude of beings is great wisdom, in order to cause the Dharma to abide for a long time.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b16_8']	亦令聞者修於二利，令法久住修自利，為益有情修利他故。	亦令聞者修於二利，令法久住修自利，為益有情修利他故。	001	It also causes the listeners to cultivate the two benefits. Cultivating self-benefit in order to cause the Dharma to abide for a long time is for the sake of benefiting sentient beings, cultivating benefiting others.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b18_10']	《瑜伽論》八十二云「若具如是五分說法，如五分樂，能令自他生大喜樂，又能引發自他利益。	《瑜伽論》八十二云「若具如是五分說法，如五分樂，能令自他生大喜樂，又能引發自他利益。	001	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, fascicle 82, says: If one possesses these five aspects of expounding the Dharma, like the five kinds of joy, it can cause oneself and others to give rise to great joy and happiness, and it can also attract the benefit of oneself and others.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b19_6']	」釋此五分，如《仁王般若疏》中具明。	」釋此五分，如《仁王般若疏》中具明。	001	The explanation of these five aspects is fully clarified in the Renwang bore shu.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b19_11']	又有三緣：	又有三緣：	001	There are also three conditions:
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b20_6']	一令生欲樂、二令修行、三令斷障。	一令生欲樂、二令修行、三令斷障。	001	First, causing the arising of desire and joy; second, causing practice; third, causing the elimination of hindrances.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b20_19']	即明眾生欲聞之法莫過三種：	即明眾生欲聞之法莫過三種：	001	It clearly shows that the Dharma that sentient beings wish to hear is no more than three kinds:
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b22_2']	一願求勝果并利有情、二所修之行、三所除之障。	一願求勝果并利有情、二所修之行、三所除之障。	001	The first is the superior fruition sought through vows and benefiting sentient beings, the second is the practice cultivated, and the third is the hindrances to be eliminated.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b24_2']	如《般若經》善現所問，既云「諸有發趣菩薩乘者云何住」等，明知發趣所餘之乘亦有三種。	如《般若經》善現所問，既云「諸有發趣菩薩乘者云何住」等，明知發趣所餘之乘亦有三種。	001	As the Prajnaparamita Sutra states, Subhuti's question, How should those who have set out on the Bodhisattva vehicle abide? and so forth, clearly shows that those who have set out on the other vehicles also have these three aspects.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b25_16']	人天乘中雖不斷種，亦能制伏三惡道障，得生人天，故各有三，此由機感。	人天乘中雖不斷種，亦能制伏三惡道障，得生人天，故各有三，此由機感。	001	Although the human and heavenly vehicles do not eliminate the seeds, they are able to restrain the hindrances of the three evil destinies and attain birth in the human and heavenly realms. Therefore, each has three aspects. This is due to the capacity of the practitioner.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b25_21']	又有四緣：	又有四緣：	001	There are also four conditions:
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b28_6']	一未離苦者欲令離苦、未得樂者欲令得樂、未能發心斷惡修善者欲令斷惡修善、未成佛者願早成佛。	一未離苦者欲令離苦、未得樂者欲令得樂、未能發心斷惡修善者欲令斷惡修善、未成佛者願早成佛。	001	First, those who have not yet escaped suffering should be made to escape suffering, those who have not yet attained happiness should be made to attain happiness, those who are unable to arouse the mind to eliminate evil and cultivate good should be made to eliminate evil and cultivate good, and those who have not yet become Buddhas should be made to quickly become Buddhas.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175b29_12']	此由悲願，故《法華經》第三云「未度者令度，度是離苦義。	此由悲願，故《法華經》第三云「未度者令度，度是離苦義。	001	This is due to compassion and vows. Therefore, the Lotus Sutra, chapter three, states, Those who have not yet crossed over should be made to cross over. Crossing over means the meaning of escaping suffering.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c01_5']	未解者令解，解者斷惡修善義。	未解者令解，解者斷惡修善義。	001	Those who have not yet been liberated should be made to be liberated. Liberation means the meaning of eliminating evil and cultivating good.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c01_18']	未安者令安，安者令得樂義。	未安者令安，安者令得樂義。	001	The meaning of causing those who are not yet at peace to be at peace, and those who are at peace to attain bliss is as follows.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c02_16']	未涅槃者令得涅槃，即未成佛願成佛義。	未涅槃者令得涅槃，即未成佛願成佛義。	001	Causing those who have not yet attained nirvana to attain nirvana means the vow to attain Buddhahood for those who have not yet become Buddhas.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c03_10']	」即是如次依四弘願化生次第。	」即是如次依四弘願化生次第。	001	This is the sequence of transforming beings based on the four great vows.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c05_1']	《法華》第三云「眾生常苦惱，盲冥無導師，不識苦盡道，不知求解脫。	《法華》第三云「眾生常苦惱，盲冥無導師，不識苦盡道，不知求解脫。	001	The third chapter of the Lotus Sutra says, Sentient beings are always suffering and distressed, blind and without a guide, not knowing the path to the end of suffering, not knowing how to seek liberation.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c05_18']	」乃至云「今佛得最上，安穩無漏道。	」乃至云「今佛得最上，安穩無漏道。	001	It goes on to say, Now the Buddha has attained the supreme, peaceful, and undefiled path.

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c08_3']	」此意常苦惱是苦諦，盲冥無導師是集諦，不識苦盡道道諦，不知求解脫滅諦。	」此意常苦惱是苦諦，盲冥無導師是集諦，不識苦盡道道諦，不知求解脫滅諦。	001	This means that sentient beings are always suffering and distressed is the truth of suffering, blind and without a guide is the truth of the accumulation [of suffering], not knowing the path to the end of suffering is the truth of the path [to the end of suffering], and not knowing how to seek liberation is the truth of cessation [of suffering].
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c09_7']	明先不解，今佛出世示悟使解，令知苦斷集證滅修道。	明先不解，今佛出世示悟使解，令知苦斷集證滅修道。	001	It clarifies that they did not understand before, but now that the Buddha has appeared in the world, he reveals and awakens them so that they understand, causing them to know suffering, cut off accumulation, realize cessation, and cultivate the path.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0175c12_19']	又有五緣，如《思益經》第二云「若人能於如來所說文字言說章句通達隨順」乃至云「能知如來以何說法、以何隨宜說、以何方便說、以何法門說、以何大悲說。	又有五緣，如《思益經》第二云「若人能於如來所說文字言說章句通達隨順」乃至云「能知如來以何說法、以何隨宜說、以何方便說、以何法門說、以何大悲說。	001	There are also five conditions, as the second chapter of the Siyi jing says: If a person can understand and follow the words, phrases, and sentences spoken by the Tathāgata... and so on, up to he can know by what the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma, by what he teaches according to the inclinations [of the audience], by what skillful means he teaches, by what Dharma gate he teaches, and by what great compassion he teaches.

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b01_16']	既知勝果不可虛成，必待修因方能剋會。	既知勝果不可虛成，必待修因方能剋會。	001	Since it is known that the supreme fruit cannot be accomplished in vain, it must be attained through the cultivation of causes.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b03_20']	將修勝行，先須改責前非宿善能悔往愆，是故佛加妙幢令得夢悔其前非，故有〈夢見懺悔品〉。	將修勝行，先須改責前非宿善能悔往愆，是故佛加妙幢令得夢悔其前非，故有〈夢見懺悔品〉。	001	Before cultivating the supreme practices, one must first correct the previous faults and repent of past offenses. Therefore, the Buddha bestows the wonderful banner and allows him to dream and repent of his previous faults, so there is the chapter on repenting in a dream.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b06_5']	雖有夢中除過，未為明了，故心滅障惡在勝因，是故因如來放光驚覺帝釋，因茲啟請願說懺洗之方。	雖有夢中除過，未為明了，故心滅障惡在勝因，是故因如來放光驚覺帝釋，因茲啟請願說懺洗之方。	001	Although there are faults removed in the dream, it is not yet clear, so the mind removes hindrances and evil is in the supreme cause. Therefore, due to the Tathāgata's light illuminating and startling Indra, he asks about the method of repenting and washing.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b06_19']	佛為廣陳，故次〈懺悔品〉起。	佛為廣陳，故次〈懺悔品〉起。	001	The Buddha extensively explains it, so the chapter on repentance arises next.

Therefore, the lion-like characteristics arouse the profound mechanism, and the Tathagata's great compassion sequentially explains the arousal of the mind, cultivation, severing of hindrances, realization of truth, and protection through spiritual spells. Therefore, there is the chapter on the Pure Dharani.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b13_2']	此等勝業肇因妙幢，眾欲願知何能如是，故佛為說往昔因緣，曰其過去名金龍主，以蓮華喻讚歎諸佛，藉斯勝業故能發揚壽量創啟懺方，故有〈蓮華喻讚品〉。	此等勝業肇因妙幢，眾欲願知何能如是，故佛為說往昔因緣，曰其過去名金龍主，以蓮華喻讚歎諸佛，藉斯勝業故能發揚壽量創啟懺方，故有〈蓮華喻讚品〉。	001	These excellent activities originate from the wonderful banner. The multitude wishes to know how one can be like this. Therefore, the Buddha explains the causes and conditions of the past, saying that in the past he was named Golden Dragon Lord, and praised the Buddhas with lotus flower metaphors. Relying on this excellent karma, he was able to promote the lifespan and initiate the method of repentance. Therefore, there is the chapter on the Lotus Flower Metaphor Praise.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b14_10']	既由供讚諸佛為因，故教持呪令恒見佛，故有〈金勝陀羅尼品〉。	既由供讚諸佛為因，故教持呪令恒見佛，故有〈金勝陀羅尼品〉。	001	Since the causes for making offerings and praising the Buddhas are already present, the teaching of upholding the spells causes one to always see the Buddha. Therefore, there is the chapter on the Golden Victory Dharani.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b15_10']	雖復廣明因果令願修行，未顯二空蕩其情執。	雖復廣明因果令願修行，未顯二空蕩其情執。	001	Although it extensively clarifies causes and effects and causes one to cultivate with vows, it does not yet reveal the two emptinesses to eliminate emotional attachments.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b18_7']	又前諸品多據俗諦勸物起修，明其二空依勝義諦令除封著，前隨諸義雖略明之，今更廣陳令得開悟，故有〈重顯空性品〉。	又前諸品多據俗諦勸物起修，明其二空依勝義諦令除封著，前隨諸義雖略明之，今更廣陳令得開悟，故有〈重顯空性品〉。	001	Moreover, the previous chapters mostly discuss the conventional truth to encourage beings to cultivate, clarifying the two kinds of emptiness based on the ultimate truth to make them abandon attachments. Although the previous chapters briefly discuss this based on various meanings, now they are further explained in detail to enable understanding, thus there is the chapter Re-illuminating the Nature of Emptiness.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b19_2']	已前多明有行，恐滯住有而不證真；	已前多明有行，恐滯住有而不證真；	001	Before this, it mostly clarifies existence, fearing that if one becomes attached to existence, one will not realize the truth;

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b24_4']	上明為於即席廣明菩提涅槃因果，果求因習真俗雙觀。	上明為於即席廣明菩提涅槃因果，果求因習真俗雙觀。	001	Above, it clarifies for those present extensively illuminating the causes and effects of bodhi and nirvana, seeking the effects and cultivating the causes, and the two truths being contemplated together.

If one does not add protection and assist with various conditions, then obstacles will arise and one will be unable to practice. If the Dharma is not practiced by people, how can it spread in the world?
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182b29_4']	故假四王之福力、八部之加威，人天敬重始得流布，故有〈四天王觀察人天品〉。	故假四王之福力、八部之加威，人天敬重始得流布，故有〈四天王觀察人天品〉。	001	Therefore, relying on the blessings and powers of the Four Heavenly Kings and the added authority of the eight divisions, respected by humans and gods, it can begin to spread, so there is the chapter on the Four Heavenly Kings observing humans and gods.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c02_9']	又經行之處利益良多，所至處方咸應敬養，敬養令法增長廣、天神喜而加護，故有〈四天王護國品〉。	又經行之處利益良多，所至處方咸應敬養，敬養令法增長廣、天神喜而加護，故有〈四天王護國品〉。	001	Moreover, the place where the sūtra is practiced has many benefits. Wherever it goes, the directions should all respect and support it. Respect and support cause the Dharma to increase and spread widely. The celestial gods rejoice and add protection, so there is the chapter on the Four Heavenly Kings protecting the country.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c05_1']	然恐學者染著諸境退大菩提，故說神呪，能誦之者令無染著，生死輪迴求無上果而心不退，故〈無染著陀羅尼品〉起。	然恐學者染著諸境退大菩提，故說神呪，能誦之者令無染著，生死輪迴求無上果而心不退，故〈無染著陀羅尼品〉起。	001	However, it is feared that learners will be attached to various realms and retreat from great enlightenment, so the divine mantra is taught. Those who can recite it will be free from attachment, and in the cycle of birth and death, seeking the unsurpassed fruit, their minds will not retreat, so the chapter on the dhāraṇī of non-attachment arises.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c07_5']	雖令無退猶有難緣，恐怖諸橫來侵妨其修習，故說神呪除怖抂死，無怖修行，故有〈如意寶珠品〉。	雖令無退猶有難緣，恐怖諸橫來侵妨其修習，故說神呪除怖抂死，無怖修行，故有〈如意寶珠品〉。	001	Although it prevents backsliding, there are still difficult circumstances, fears, and various calamities that invade and obstruct one's practice, so the dhāraṇī is taught to remove fears and untimely death, and to practice fearlessly. Therefore, there is the chapter on the wish-fulfilling jewel.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c10_12']	既不退離怖能自修行，菩薩為懷必須弘法濟物，弘法濟物必假身安具足四辨，故辯才天女說呪護助，兼教洗浴得辯身安，故有〈大辯才天女品〉。	既不退離怖能自修行，菩薩為懷必須弘法濟物，弘法濟物必假身安具足四辨，故辯才天女說呪護助，兼教洗浴得辯身安，故有〈大辯才天女品〉。	001	Since one does not backslide or fear, and is able to practice on one's own, bodhisattvas must necessarily propagate the Dharma and save beings. Propagating the Dharma and saving beings necessarily relies on physical comfort and possessing the four kinds of eloquence, so the goddess of eloquence speaks a mantra to protect and assist, and also teaches bathing to attain eloquence and physical comfort. Therefore, there is the chapter on the great goddess of eloquence.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c12_16']	雖得身安具辯，必藉四事，資緣若闕，緣求事妨弘濟，次教小用功力多具資緣，故有〈大吉祥天女品〉。	雖得身安具辯，必藉四事，資緣若闕，緣求事妨弘濟，次教小用功力多具資緣，故有〈大吉祥天女品〉。	001	Although one attains physical comfort and eloquence, one must rely on the four requisites. If the conditions are lacking, seeking conditions interferes with propagating and saving. Next, it teaches using a little effort to obtain many conditions. Therefore, there is the chapter on the great auspicious goddess.

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c16_3']	行學貧乏心求不遂，勝福無因得生，故教福足之方，令依得流聖教，故有〈大吉祥天女增長財物品〉。	行學貧乏心求不遂，勝福無因得生，故教福足之方，令依得流聖教，故有〈大吉祥天女增長財物品〉。	001	Those who practice and study are poor and lacking, their wishes not fulfilled, and they lack the causes for supreme blessings and can be reborn, so the teaching provides methods for fulfilling blessings, allowing them to rely on the flowing holy teachings, thus there is the chapter on the Great Auspicious Goddess Increasing Wealth and Goods.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c17_15']	雖復財豐五穀恐非香美，欲令流經之處地味精芳，故有〈堅牢地神品〉。	雖復財豐五穀恐非香美，欲令流經之處地味精芳，故有〈堅牢地神品〉。	001	Even though wealth is abundant, the five grains may not be fragrant and delicious.

Understanding the conventional and penetrating the true nature always gives rise to good paths. In order to teach and attain these two causes, there is the chapter on the Great General of the Yakṣas, Saṃgharakṣita.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0182c22_7']	又復國王勢力能為損益，若不正理，災變多生，眾長邪心難聞此教，須教王正理弘揚此經，故有〈王法正論品〉。	又復國王勢力能為損益，若不正理，災變多生，眾長邪心難聞此教，須教王正理弘揚此經，故有〈王法正論品〉。	001	Moreover, the power of the king can bring harm and benefit. If the principles are not correct, calamities will arise frequently, and the multitude will have deviant thoughts, making it difficult to hear this teaching. It is necessary to teach the king the correct principles to promote this sūtra, thus there is the chapter on the Correct Discourse on Kingly Law.

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a15_13']	如《法華經論》及無著菩薩《般若論》辨，離二障故名最清淨，不共二乘名甚深，諸法自性名法界。	如《法華經論》及無著菩薩《般若論》辨，離二障故名最清淨，不共二乘名甚深，諸法自性名法界。	001	As explained in the Lotus Sutra Treatise and Asanga's Prajna Treatise, it is called most pure because it is free from the two hindrances, very profound because it is not shared with the two vehicles, and dharma realm because it is the intrinsic nature of all dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a17_7']	即此法界是諸佛境智所緣故，功德性邊即為佛土，法身所依名如來所居。	即此法界是諸佛境智所緣故，功德性邊即為佛土，法身所依名如來所居。	001	This dharma realm is the object of the wisdom of the Buddhas, and the limit of the nature of merits and virtues is the Buddha land. The basis of the Dharma body is called the abode of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a20_2']	故《解深密經》第五云「如來所行謂一切種，如來共有不可思議無量功德眾所莊嚴清淨佛土，即功德義相邊名自性法身。	故《解深密經》第五云「如來所行謂一切種，如來共有不可思議無量功德眾所莊嚴清淨佛土，即功德義相邊名自性法身。	001	Therefore, the fifth chapter of the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra says, The practice of the Tathāgata refers to the pure Buddha land adorned by the inconceivable and immeasurable merits and virtues possessed by the Tathāgata in all aspects. The meaning of merits and virtues and the limit of characteristics are called the essential Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a21_1']	以功德相即依真如，不離性故名之為住。	以功德相即依真如，不離性故名之為住。	001	Because the characteristics of merits and virtues are based on suchness and are inseparable from the nature, it is called abiding.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a21_10']	或智內證云如來居。	或智內證云如來居。	001	Or it is called the abode of the Tathāgata because it is realized internally by wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a22_14']	」又《佛地論》云「佛無二住即是法身真如為體，無差別相。	」又《佛地論》云「佛無二住即是法身真如為體，無差別相。	001	The Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra also says, The two abodes of the Buddha are precisely the Dharma body, which takes suchness as its essence and has no differentiated characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a24_1']	」又解「離障真如名最清淨」等，即能證智常證如故名之為住。	」又解「離障真如名最清淨」等，即能證智常證如故名之為住。	001	Another interpretation says that the most pure refers to the true suchness free from hindrances, etc., and the wisdom that is able to realize always realizes suchness, so it is called abiding.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a25_15']	故《佛地》第二云「於中一切二相分別皆不現行，緣彼勝定常住其中故名為住。	故《佛地》第二云「於中一切二相分別皆不現行，緣彼勝定常住其中故名為住。	001	Therefore, the second chapter of the Buddha Land Treatise says, In this, all dualistic conceptualization does not operate, and one always abides in that supreme samādhi, therefore it is called 'abiding.'
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184a26_1']	」住即居義。	」住即居義。	001	 Abiding means the meaning of dwelling.

Ānanda heard it and it is also called the Buddha's teaching. Therefore, the compiler only said that he was dwelling in the royal city.

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b05_18']	今者解云：	今者解云：	001	Now, the explanation is as follows:
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b08_12']	但是一時一處，以妙幢聞四佛所說，共諸大眾往至佛所重更說之，十方菩薩俱讚此佛，非往他土讚彼如來，故一時處。	但是一時一處，以妙幢聞四佛所說，共諸大眾往至佛所重更說之，十方菩薩俱讚此佛，非往他土讚彼如來，故一時處。	001	It is only one time and one place. Subahu heard what the four Buddhas said, and together with the great assembly he went to where the Buddha was and spoke of it again. The Bodhisattvas from the ten directions all praised this Buddha, not going to other lands to praise that Tathagata, therefore it is one time and one place.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b09_16']	若不如是，在室夢見金鼓，寤往佛說，即應五時四處。	若不如是，在室夢見金鼓，寤往佛說，即應五時四處。	001	If it were not so, then when he was in the chamber he dreamed of the golden drum, and when he woke up he went to where the Buddha was and spoke of it, then it would be the fifth time and the fourth place.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b10_19']	夢見鼓時不言室淨，說壽量時變室淨故，故為二處。	夢見鼓時不言室淨，說壽量時變室淨故，故為二處。	001	When he dreamed of the drum, he did not say that the chamber was pure. When he spoke of the lifespan, he transformed the chamber to be pure, therefore it is the second place.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b12_12']	夢時說時晨夕別故，彼既不別為時，明知在室四如來說，不得別為時處。	夢時說時晨夕別故，彼既不別為時，明知在室四如來說，不得別為時處。	001	The time of the dream and the time of speaking are different in the morning and evening, therefore he did not distinguish them as different times. It is clear that the four Tathagatas spoke while in the chamber, and it cannot be distinguished as a different time and place.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b13_18']	或可二時二處，妙幢室夢，未對佛前未得云說，故非時處；	或可二時二處，妙幢室夢，未對佛前未得云說，故非時處；	001	Or it may be that the two times and two places, the room of Sudhana and the dream, were before the Buddha, and it could not yet be said to be the time and place;
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b14_16']	以四如來在妙幢室說佛壽量，故為時處。	以四如來在妙幢室說佛壽量，故為時處。	001	Because the four Tathagatas spoke of the Buddha's lifespan in Sudhana's room, it is the time and place.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b15_10']	然前釋勝，以其阿難稱我聞故；	然前釋勝，以其阿難稱我聞故；	001	However, the previous explanation is superior, because Ananda said I have heard;
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b16_11']	四佛說壽，阿難時在釋迦佛所，不得云我聞故。	四佛說壽，阿難時在釋迦佛所，不得云我聞故。	001	The four Buddhas spoke of the lifespan, and Ananda was at that time with Shakyamuni Buddha, and could not say I have heard.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b18_10']	若爾，如《金剛華經》言「阿難比丘得法性覺性自在王三昧，以三昧力知所說經皆能憶持。	若爾，如《金剛華經》言「阿難比丘得法性覺性自在王三昧，以三昧力知所說經皆能憶持。	001	If so, as the Vajra Flower Sutra says, Ananda Bhikshu attained the Dharma nature, the nature of awakening, the freely sovereign king samadhi, and by the power of samadhi knew that the sutras spoken could all be remembered and upheld;
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b20_12']	」又《觀佛三昧經》云「阿難因聞佛說念佛，阿難見佛，即憶過去九十億佛所說經藏，憶持不忘。	」又《觀佛三昧經》云「阿難因聞佛說念佛，阿難見佛，即憶過去九十億佛所說經藏，憶持不忘。	001	And the Sutra of Contemplating the Buddha says, Because Ananda heard the Buddha speak of mindfulness of the Buddha, Ananda saw the Buddha and immediately remembered the sutra treasury spoken by ninety kotis of Buddhas in the past, remembering and upholding it without forgetting.
['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b21_15']	」今亦何妨佛力加被見佛聞經，竝能記憶得云我聞。	」今亦何妨佛力加被見佛聞經，竝能記憶得云我聞。	001	Now, how could it be prevented that the Buddha's power was added to see the Buddha and hear the sutra, both being able to remember and say I have heard?

['ZH_T39_1788_001:0184b24_17']	今妙幢室四如來說，阿難未聞故不能憶念，緣曾受境方言憶故。	今妙幢室四如來說，阿難未聞故不能憶念，緣曾受境方言憶故。	001	Now, the four tathagatas speaking in Sudhana's room, Ananda did not hear them, so he was unable to remember them, because he only speaks of remembering things he has experienced.
