It can remove obscurations and darkness, emit light, bestow benefits, and be a guide. For the blind, it creates pure eyes; for those in darkness, it makes a bright lamp. It leads those who have lost the way to enter the right path. It reveals the nature of all dharmas, which is sarvajña. It shows that all dharmas are neither extinguished nor born. It is the mother of all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas. It enables the buddhas to fully turn the unsurpassed Dharma wheel of the three turnings and twelve aspects. For those without refuge, it provides refuge. It can remove all the suffering and distress of birth and death. It reveals that the nature of all dharmas is their naturelessness.
