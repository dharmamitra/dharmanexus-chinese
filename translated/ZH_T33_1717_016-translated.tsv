The word all in the sutra completely includes all capacities. Only appearing once in a while is enough to show the last time. Why not use it as a metaphor, but use the lotus flower instead?
['ZH_T33_1717_016:0927c09_16']	然經文兩處明優曇華者，「如優曇鉢華時一現耳」，又「譬如優曇華一切皆愛樂」，今但云「時一現耳」。	然經文兩處明優曇華者，「如優曇鉢華時一現耳」，又「譬如優曇華一切皆愛樂」，今但云「時一現耳」。	However, the sutra text mentions the udumbara flower in two places. Like the udumbara flower, it only appears once in a while, and It is like the udumbara flower, which everyone loves and enjoys. Now it only says only appearing once in a while.

['ZH_T33_1717_016:0927c12_6']	三明用喻意中二：	三明用喻意中二：	Third, clarifying the meaning of using the metaphor is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_016:0927c13_6']	初敘涅槃通論八喻，次明經論分喻非極。	初敘涅槃通論八喻，次明經論分喻非極。	First, it narrates the Nirvana Sutra's general discussion of the eight metaphors. Next, it clarifies that the division of metaphors in the sutra and treatises is not ultimate.
['ZH_T33_1717_016:0927c16_2']	言「涅槃八喻」者，凡諸經論取喻不同，有分有遍，如《大經》云，喻有八種，謂順喻、逆喻、現喻、非喻、先喻、後喻、先後喻、遍喻。	言「涅槃八喻」者，凡諸經論取喻不同，有分有遍，如《大經》云，喻有八種，謂順喻、逆喻、現喻、非喻、先喻、後喻、先後喻、遍喻。	As for the eight parables of nirvana, generally speaking, the scriptures and treatises take parables differently, some are partial and some are all-encompassing. As the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, There are eight kinds of parables, namely: parables of conformity, parables of reversal, parables of manifestation, parables of non-similarity, parables of the past, parables of the future, parables of the past and future, and all-encompassing parables.
['ZH_T33_1717_016:0927c19_13']	分喻者具如經說，故第五云「面貌端正如盛滿月，白象鮮潔猶如雪山」，滿月不可即同於面，雪山不可即是白象，不可以喻喻真解脫，為眾生故故作是喻。	分喻者具如經說，故第五云「面貌端正如盛滿月，白象鮮潔猶如雪山」，滿月不可即同於面，雪山不可即是白象，不可以喻喻真解脫，為眾生故故作是喻。	As for partial parables, they are fully explained in the sūtra. Therefore, the fifth [parable] says: The facial features are upright and beautiful like a full moon, and the white elephant is as pure as the snow mountains. A full moon cannot be the same as a face, and snow mountains cannot be the same as a white elephant. One cannot use a parable to illustrate true liberation, but for the sake of sentient beings, one uses this parable.
['ZH_T33_1717_016:0927c21_1']	今亦如是不可以喻喻於妙法，為眾生故以喻蓮華。	今亦如是不可以喻喻於妙法，為眾生故以喻蓮華。	Now it is also like this. One cannot use a parable to illustrate the wonderful Dharma, but for the sake of sentient beings, one uses the parable of the lotus flower.

Provisional and real do not go beyond the dharmas of the ten dharma realms, so it is briefly used to correspond with them.
