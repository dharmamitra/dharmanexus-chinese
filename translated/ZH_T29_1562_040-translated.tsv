['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568a04_17']	不安隱業名為不善，由此能招非愛異熟，極能遮止趣涅槃故。	不安隱業名為不善，由此能招非愛異熟，極能遮止趣涅槃故。	040	Unpeaceful karma is called unwholesome because it can attract unlovable karmic retribution, and is extremely able to obstruct the path to nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568a06_6']	非前二業立無記名，不可記為善不善故，是非安隱不安隱義。	非前二業立無記名，不可記為善不善故，是非安隱不安隱義。	040	Karma that is neither of the two is established as indeterminate because it cannot be described as wholesome or unwholesome. This is the meaning of neither peaceful nor unpeaceful.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568a22_3']	謂欲界中餘趣處滿業，由別緣力可異趣處受，以或有業能感外內財位、形量色力樂等，於天等中此業應熟，由別緣力所引轉故，於人等中此業便熟。	謂欲界中餘趣處滿業，由別緣力可異趣處受，以或有業能感外內財位、形量色力樂等，於天等中此業應熟，由別緣力所引轉故，於人等中此業便熟。	040	This means that in the realm of desire, action that should be requited in other destinies and places may be requited in other destinies and places because of the power of other conditions. This is because there are actions that can attract external and internal wealth, status, physical form, size, color, strength, happiness, etc., and action that should be requited in the heavens, etc., may be requited in the human realm, etc., because it is attracted and transformed by the power of other conditions.

Because the action of non-merit is purely defiled, it must be based on the ignorance that is the characteristic of coarseness and continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568a27_15']	由此無明現在前位，不能解信因果相屬，是故發起諸非福行。	由此無明現在前位，不能解信因果相屬，是故發起諸非福行。	040	Because of this ignorance, one is unable to understand and believe in the connection between cause and effect. Therefore, one gives rise to various non-meritorious actions.

Due to the power of this, they are unable to truly understand that the nature of the three realms is all suffering, and give rise to meritorious and immovable karma as the cause for future existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b03_17']	若已見諦者則無是事，乘先行力漸離染時，如次得生欲色無色。	若已見諦者則無是事，乘先行力漸離染時，如次得生欲色無色。	040	Those who have already seen the truth do not have this. By the power of past actions, when gradually becoming free from defilements, they are reborn in the desire realm, form realm, and formless realm in order.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b12_12']	諸善業中，始從欲界至第三靜慮，名順樂受業，以諸樂受唯至此故。	諸善業中，始從欲界至第三靜慮，名順樂受業，以諸樂受唯至此故。	040	all good actions from the realm of desire up to the third trance state are called action that is favorable to the feeling of pleasure, because all feelings of pleasure are only found up to the third trance state.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b13_2']	諸不善業，名順苦受。	諸不善業，名順苦受。	040	All bad actions are called action that is favorable to the feeling of suffering.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b15_12']	非此諸業唯感受果，應知亦感彼受資糧。	非此諸業唯感受果，應知亦感彼受資糧。	040	You must understand that these actions not only produce feelings as results but also produce the requisites of those feelings.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b20_6']	豈不中定與初靜慮同一縛故，此中定業感初定中樂根異熟？	豈不中定與初靜慮同一縛故，此中定業感初定中樂根異熟？	040	Isn’t it true that the intermediate trance state and the first trance state are bound by the same bond? Therefore the karma of the intermediate trance state produces the faculty of pleasure in the first trance state.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b21_15']	曰：	曰：	040	It says,
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b22_3']	有，謂善無尋業。	有，謂善無尋業。	040	Yes, namely good karma without vitarka.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b24_1']	通感身心二受異熟，便違本論。	通感身心二受異熟，便違本論。	040	If it produces both a pleasant feeling and a pleasant body as retribution, it would contradict the Śāriputrābhidharma.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b25_9']	設許通感，無違本論。	設許通感，無違本論。	040	Even if it is admitted that it produces both, there is no contradiction with the Śāriputrābhidharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b26_18']	本論應言善無伺故，或非諸業皆感受果故，彼應感色心不相應行。	本論應言善無伺故，或非諸業皆感受果故，彼應感色心不相應行。	040	The Śāriputrābhidharma should say that it is good karma without consideration, or it should say that not all karma produces feeling as retribution, and therefore it should produce form and dharmas not directly associated with mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568b28_7']	然於一切無尋業中，有業唯能感心受果，偏就彼說故無有過。	然於一切無尋業中，有業唯能感心受果，偏就彼說故無有過。	040	However, among all actions without investigation, there are actions that can only produce results as mental feelings. Speaking in terms of just those, there is no error.

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c01_3']	若爾，此中更有餘證，謂本論說：	若爾，此中更有餘證，謂本論說：	040	If that is so, there is further evidence here, namely, the Abhidharma-śāstra says:

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c01_18']	曰：	曰：	040	It is said:
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c02_7']	有，謂順樂受業，色；	有，謂順樂受業，色；	040	Yes, they are: actions that accord with pleasant feeling, form;
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c02_17']	順苦受業，心心所法；	順苦受業，心心所法；	040	actions that accord with painful feeling, mind and mental factors;

['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c04_8']	由此證知，下地亦有順非二業。	由此證知，下地亦有順非二業。	040	By this evidence, it is known that the lower stages also have actions that are neither.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c05_3']	非離欲界有此三業，俱時熟故。	非離欲界有此三業，俱時熟故。	040	Apart from the desire realm, there are these three actions, because they mature simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c06_2']	此亦非證，以本論中說三界業如三受故。	此亦非證，以本論中說三界業如三受故。	040	This is also not evidence, because in the Abhidharma-śāstra, the actions of the three realms are said to be like the three feelings.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c10_1']	然非三界所繫諸業可俱時受，此亦應然，而本論言有三界業俱時熟者，為欲試驗於對法宗解不解故，或於增上果說受異熟聲，色無色思資下異熟令其久住，故作是言。	然非三界所繫諸業可俱時受，此亦應然，而本論言有三界業俱時熟者，為欲試驗於對法宗解不解故，或於增上果說受異熟聲，色無色思資下異熟令其久住，故作是言。	040	However, it is not the case that the results of actions not bound to the three realms can be experienced simultaneously. This is also so for the three realms. The Abhidharma treatise states that the results of actions of the three realms mature simultaneously in order to test whether one understands the tenets of the Abhidharma or not. Alternatively, it speaks of the experience of the dominant result as the experience of the retribution result. Form and formless realm volition nourishes the retribution of the lower realms, causing it to last a long time, and for this reason it is said that the results of actions of the three realms mature simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c11_11']	順三受業文亦容作此釋，故彼所引非定證因，何苦推徵彼所計執。	順三受業文亦容作此釋，故彼所引非定證因，何苦推徵彼所計執。	040	The text can also be interpreted in the same way as the statement that actions are in conformity with the three feelings. Therefore the evidence you have adduced is not conclusive. Why do you insist on investigating what they believe?
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c12_7']	見彼所計執，違《品類足》故，如說：	見彼所計執，違《品類足》故，如說：	040	We see that what they believe contradicts the Põxing lun, which says:
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c12_14']	云何順樂受業？	云何順樂受業？	040	What is action that is in conformity with pleasant feeling?
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c13_5']	謂從欲界繫至三定善業。	謂從欲界繫至三定善業。	040	It is good action bound to the realm of desire up to the third trance state.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c14_4']	無違彼失，無定言故，謂彼不言唯順樂受。	無違彼失，無定言故，謂彼不言唯順樂受。	040	There is no contradiction with that treatise, because it does not say that it is only in conformity with pleasant feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c15_12']	然下雖有順非二業，而由少故彼文不顯，不可准此便作是言：	然下雖有順非二業，而由少故彼文不顯，不可准此便作是言：	040	Even though there is action in the lower stages that is in conformity with neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling, it is not mentioned in the text because it is slight. You cannot use this to say that
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c16_2']	上地亦應有順苦樂。	上地亦應有順苦樂。	040	in the upper stages there is also action in conformity with unpleasant and pleasant feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c16_11']	離苦樂染方生彼故。	離苦樂染方生彼故。	040	because one is born there only after being free from the defilements of happiness and suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c18_17']	由此唯說從廣果天乃至非想，有順非苦非樂受業，不說下地，以上地無相違受故，於下地有相違受故。	由此唯說從廣果天乃至非想，有順非苦非樂受業，不說下地，以上地無相違受故，於下地有相違受故。	040	Consequently, only the heaven of vast fruit and above, up to the non-conscious heaven, have karma that is conducive to the feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant, and the lower stages are not mentioned, because there is no feeling that is contrary to the feeling of neither suffering nor happiness above, and because there is a feeling that is contrary to it below.
['ZH_T29_1562_040:0568c20_15']	以於下地容有非苦非樂異熟，不可如彼三界繫業定判，此文無容有容實俱受故。	以於下地容有非苦非樂異熟，不可如彼三界繫業定判，此文無容有容實俱受故。	040	Because it is possible that retribution as neither suffering nor happiness exists in the lower stages, it cannot be definitely determined, as in the case of the three realms of existence, that this text does not have both feelings of suffering and happiness.
