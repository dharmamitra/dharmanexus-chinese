['ZH_T33_1711_001:0542c23_15']	體，三、訓釋題目，四、判文解釋。	體，三、訓釋題目，四、判文解釋。	001	In explaining this sūtra, there are four aspects of analysis: first, the causes and conditions for the arising of the teaching; second, discerning the essence of the sūtra's doctrine; third, interpreting the title; fourth, classifying and explaining the text.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0542c27_18']	言教起者，竊以至理幽寂，妙絕有無之境，法相甚深，能超名言之表，然則趣理無方，乃開二藏之說，設教有依，具現三身之應，可謂泉水澄清，月影頓現，諸敵冥動，天鼓自鳴。	言教起者，竊以至理幽寂，妙絕有無之境，法相甚深，能超名言之表，然則趣理無方，乃開二藏之說，設教有依，具現三身之應，可謂泉水澄清，月影頓現，諸敵冥動，天鼓自鳴。	001	As for the causes for the arising of the teaching, I humbly consider that the ultimate truth is profoundly tranquil, wondrously transcending the realm of existence and non-existence, the characteristics of phenomena are extremely profound, able to transcend the realm of names and words. However, there is no fixed approach to realizing the truth, so the teachings of the two piṭakas are opened up; in establishing the teachings there is reliance, fully manifesting the response of the three bodies. It can be said that when the spring water is clear, the reflection of the moon suddenly appears; when all enemies move in the dark, the celestial drum sounds by itself.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a02_1']	然則應物有時，隨機接引，所以如來說三法輪，未入法者令趣入，故波羅奈國施鹿林中創開生死涅槃因果，此則第一四諦法輪，能除我執；	然則應物有時，隨機接引，所以如來說三法輪，未入法者令趣入，故波羅奈國施鹿林中創開生死涅槃因果，此則第一四諦法輪，能除我執；	001	However, when responding to beings there is a time, guiding and attracting according to their capacities, thus the Tathāgata expounds the three Dharma wheels. For those who have not yet entered the Dharma, he causes them to enter, therefore in the Deer Park of the country of Vārāṇasī he initially expounds the causes and effects of birth and death and nirvāṇa. This is the first wheel of the four noble truths, able to eliminate the grasping of self;
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a04_12']	為已入者迴趣大乘，鷲峰山等十六會中說諸般若，此是第二無相法輪，由斯漸斷有性法執，而於空執猶未能遣；	為已入者迴趣大乘，鷲峰山等十六會中說諸般若，此是第二無相法輪，由斯漸斷有性法執，而於空執猶未能遣；	001	For those who have already entered [the Mahāyāna], in the sixteen assemblies such as Vulture Peak, it expounds various prajñā-pāramitā. This is the second wheel of the Dharma of non-characteristics. Through this, one gradually eliminates the attachment to the inherent nature of dharmas, but one is still unable to dispel the attachment to emptiness;
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a07_2']	是故第三蓮華藏等淨穢土中說《深密》等了義大乘，具顯空、有兩種道理，雙除有、無二種偏執，此即教之興也。	是故第三蓮華藏等淨穢土中說《深密》等了義大乘，具顯空、有兩種道理，雙除有、無二種偏執，此即教之興也。	001	Therefore, in the third [wheel], in the pure and defiled lands such as the Lotus Treasury, it expounds the definitive meaning Mahāyāna such as the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra. It fully reveals the two kinds of principles of emptiness and existence, and eliminates the two kinds of biased attachments to existence and non-existence. This is the rise of the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a09_3', 'ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a10_12']	言宗體者，體即總明能詮教體，宗者別顯諸教所詮。🔽然佛教體，諸說不同，薩婆多宗用聲為體，名等無記，聲是善故。	言宗體者，體即總明能詮教體，宗者別顯諸教所詮。 然佛教體，諸說不同，薩婆多宗用聲為體，名等無記，聲是善故。	001	As for the essence and purport, the essence generally clarifies the essence of the teaching that can be expounded. The purport specifically reveals what is expounded in the various teachings.🔽However, there are different explanations regarding the essence of the Buddhist teaching. The Sarvâstivāda school takes sound as its essence. Names and phrases are indeterminate, but sound is good.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a11_11']	依經部宗，相續假聲，離聲無別名、句等故。	依經部宗，相續假聲，離聲無別名、句等故。	001	According to the Sautrāntika school, the continuity of sound is a provisional concept. Apart from sound, there are no separate names, phrases, etc.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a12_20']	依大乘宗，諸教不同，有處唯聲，如《無垢稱》，或有佛土聲為佛事；	依大乘宗，諸教不同，有處唯聲，如《無垢稱》，或有佛土聲為佛事；	001	According to the Mahāyāna school, the teachings are not the same. In some places, only sound is used, as in the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, where in some buddha lands, sound is the buddha's work;
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a14_2']	有處但用名等為體，如《成唯識》，法無礙智，名等為境；	有處但用名等為體，如《成唯識》，法無礙智，名等為境；	001	In some places, only names, etc. are used as the essence, as in the Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi-śāstra, where the unobstructed cognition of dharmas takes names, etc. as its object;
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a15_12']	有處合說聲及名等，如《十地經》云，說、聽之者皆依二事，謂聲、名等。	有處合說聲及名等，如《十地經》云，說、聽之者皆依二事，謂聲、名等。	001	In some places, sound and names, etc. are combined and explained, as the Daśabhūmika-sūtra says, Those who speak and listen all rely on two things, namely sound and names, etc.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a17_13']	如何諸教有此異者，據實以假從實，皆用聲及名等以為體性，而諸聖教各據一義，故不相違。	如何諸教有此異者，據實以假從實，皆用聲及名等以為體性，而諸聖教各據一義，故不相違。	001	How is it that the various teachings have these differences? In reality, the provisional is based on the real. They all use sound and names, etc. as their essence. However, the various holy teachings each rely on one meaning, so they are not contradictory.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a17_18']	所以者何？	所以者何？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a18_18']	以假從實，用聲為體，離聲無別名、句等故；	以假從實，用聲為體，離聲無別名、句等故；	001	Because the provisional is based on the real, using sound as its essence, because apart from sound there are no separate names, phrases, etc.;
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a20_1']	以體從用，名等為體，能詮諸法自性、差別二所依故。	以體從用，名等為體，能詮諸法自性、差別二所依故。	001	Because the essence is based on the function, names, etc. are the essence, because they are able to express the self-nature and distinctions of all dharmas and are the basis of the two.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a20_22']	假、實相藉，合說為體，隨闕一種，說不成故。	假、實相藉，合說為體，隨闕一種，說不成故。	001	The provisional and the real rely on each other, and are combined to form the essence. If either one is missing, the explanation is incomplete.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a21_18']	以境從心，用識為體，經說諸法不離識故；	以境從心，用識為體，經說諸法不離識故；	001	Following the mind in regard to objects, consciousness is used as the essence, because the sūtras say that all phenomena are not apart from consciousness.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a22_19']	攝妄歸真，用如為體，《仁王》等說諸法性故。	攝妄歸真，用如為體，《仁王》等說諸法性故。	001	Bringing the false back to the true, suchness is used as the essence, because the Benevolent Kings Sūtra and other texts say that the nature of all phenomena is suchness.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a24_4']	所詮宗者略有三種，一、隨病別宗，二、部別顯宗，三、約時辨宗。	所詮宗者略有三種，一、隨病別宗，二、部別顯宗，三、約時辨宗。	001	The purport that is expounded is roughly of three kinds: first, the purport that is distinguished according to the illness; second, the purport that is revealed according to the text; third, the purport that is distinguished according to the time.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543a27_13']	隨病別宗者，謂諸有情由無明故，起貪、瞋等八萬四千諸塵勞門，是故如來應病設藥，蘊等八萬四千法門，由此一一隨其所應，蘊、處、界等為所詮宗。	隨病別宗者，謂諸有情由無明故，起貪、瞋等八萬四千諸塵勞門，是故如來應病設藥，蘊等八萬四千法門，由此一一隨其所應，蘊、處、界等為所詮宗。	001	The purport that is distinguished according to the illness refers to the eighty-four thousand gates of dust and afflictions such as greed and hatred that arise due to ignorance in sentient beings. Therefore, the Tathāgata prescribes medicine according to the illness, with eighty-four thousand Dharma gates such as the aggregates. Due to this, each one, according to what is appropriate, takes the aggregates, sense bases, and elements, etc. as the purport that is expounded.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b02_3']	部別顯宗者，於一一部，雖有諸門，究其意趣，隨部各別，如《法華經》一乘為宗，《無垢》即以不二為宗，依《涅槃經》佛性為宗，《華嚴》賢聖因果為宗，自餘諸部準上應知。	部別顯宗者，於一一部，雖有諸門，究其意趣，隨部各別，如《法華經》一乘為宗，《無垢》即以不二為宗，依《涅槃經》佛性為宗，《華嚴》賢聖因果為宗，自餘諸部準上應知。	001	As for the different schools' distinctive tenets, although each school has various approaches, if one investigates their intent, each school has its own distinct tenets. For example, the Lotus Sutra takes the One Vehicle as its tenet, the Vimalakirti Sutra takes non-duality as its tenet, the Nirvana Sutra takes Buddha-nature as its tenet, the Huayan Sutra takes the sages' causes and effects as its tenet. One should understand the other scriptures according to this principle.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b05_1']	約時辨宗者，雖諸聖教部類眾多，就時辨宗，不過三種，三種即是四諦、無相、了義大乘，如《深密》說，今此一部，諸宗之中無相為宗。	約時辨宗者，雖諸聖教部類眾多，就時辨宗，不過三種，三種即是四諦、無相、了義大乘，如《深密》說，今此一部，諸宗之中無相為宗。	001	As for distinguishing the tenets based on time, although the scriptures of the sages are numerous, if we distinguish the tenets based on time, there are no more than three kinds. The three kinds are the Four Noble Truths, the signless, and the definitive meaning of the Mahayana, as explained in the Ghanavyuha Sutra. This scripture, among all the tenets, takes the signless as its tenet.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b06_12']	「佛說般若波羅蜜多心經」。	「佛說般若波羅蜜多心經」。	001	The Heart Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom Spoken by the Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b08_10']	言題目者，「佛說」即是標能說主，梵音佛陀，此翻名覺，具真、俗智，自、他覺滿，故名為佛。	言題目者，「佛說」即是標能說主，梵音佛陀，此翻名覺，具真、俗智，自、他覺滿，故名為佛。	001	As for the title, Spoken by the Buddha indicates the speaker. The Sanskrit word buddha is translated as enlightened. Endowed with the wisdom of truth and conventionality, self-enlightened and fully enlightened for others, thus called the Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b09_3']	開敷妙門，令眾生解，名之為說。	開敷妙門，令眾生解，名之為說。	001	Opening the wondrous gate, enabling sentient beings to understand, is called expounding.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b10_4']	「般若波羅蜜多」，辨所說法，此土翻為智到彼岸。	「般若波羅蜜多」，辨所說法，此土翻為智到彼岸。	001	Prajnaparamita distinguishes the Dharma that is expounded, translated in this land as wisdom reaching the other shore.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b12_2']	「心經」正顯能詮之教，盧道之中，心王獨秀，於諸般若，此教最尊，從諭立名，故曰心也。	「心經」正顯能詮之教，盧道之中，心王獨秀，於諸般若，此教最尊，從諭立名，故曰心也。	001	Heart Sutra directly shows the teaching that is expounded. Among the various dharmas, the mind-king is unique. Among all prajnas, this teaching is the most revered. It is named after its content, thus called heart.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b14_14']	經有二義，貫穿、攝持，貫穿所應說義，攝持所化生故，此即依主，就能、所詮，法、諭立號，故言「佛說般若波羅蜜多心經」。	經有二義，貫穿、攝持，貫穿所應說義，攝持所化生故，此即依主，就能、所詮，法、諭立號，故言「佛說般若波羅蜜多心經」。	001	Sutra has two meanings: penetrating and upholding. It penetrates the meaning that should be expounded and upholds the beings to be transformed. This is the dominant condition, established based on the ability and the expounded Dharma and analogy, thus it is called The Heart Sutra Spoken by the Buddha on Prajnaparamita.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b15_7']	「觀自在菩薩」。	「觀自在菩薩」。	001	Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.

['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b19_1']	所以無序及流通者，於諸般若簡集綱要，故唯正宗，無序、流通。	所以無序及流通者，於諸般若簡集綱要，故唯正宗，無序、流通。	001	The reason there is no introduction or dissemination is because among all prajñā, it selects the essential principles, therefore, there is only the main part, without introduction or dissemination.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b19_13']	如《觀音經》，不具三分。	如《觀音經》，不具三分。	001	Like the Sūtra of Avalokitêśvara, it does not have the three parts.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b21_7']	「觀自在菩薩」者，就初分中復分為二，初、標能觀人，次、辨觀智體，此即第一標能觀人。	「觀自在菩薩」者，就初分中復分為二，初、標能觀人，次、辨觀智體，此即第一標能觀人。	001	Avalokitêśvara Bodhisattva - in the first part, it is further divided into two: first, indicating the observer; next, clarifying the essence of the observing wisdom; this is the first, indicating the observer.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b23_16']	若依舊本名觀世音，觀諸世間稱菩薩名音聲語業以救諸難，因而立號，名觀世音，猶未能顯觀身、意業。	若依舊本名觀世音，觀諸世間稱菩薩名音聲語業以救諸難，因而立號，名觀世音，猶未能顯觀身、意業。	001	If following the old text, it is called Avalokiteśvara. Observing all worlds, taking the bodhisattva's name, voice, and speech to save from various difficulties, thus establishing the name Avalokiteśvara, still unable to manifest the observation of the body and mind.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b25_9']	而今本云觀自在者，內證二空，外觀三業，不依功用，任運自在，故曰觀自在。	而今本云觀自在者，內證二空，外觀三業，不依功用，任運自在，故曰觀自在。	001	Now, the original text says Avalokitêśvara - internally realizing the two emptinesses, externally observing the three karmas, not relying on effort, spontaneously at ease, therefore called Avalokitêśvara.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543b26_8']	今此菩薩實是因位一生補處，為已成佛。	今此菩薩實是因位一生補處，為已成佛。	001	This Bodhisattva is actually in the causal stage, only one birth away from Buddhahood, but is considered to have already attained Buddhahood.

I recall that Avalokitêśvara Bodhisattva attained Buddhahood before me, called the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Knower of the Secular World, the Unsurpassed One, the Tamer of Men, the Teacher of Gods and Men, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.

['ZH_T33_1711_001:0543c21_12']	一者、即行深，無分別智內證二空，離諸分別，無能、所行以為行相，故名行深，故《大品》曰，不見行，不見不行，是名菩薩行深般若。	一者、即行深，無分別智內證二空，離諸分別，無能、所行以為行相，故名行深，故《大品》曰，不見行，不見不行，是名菩薩行深般若。	001	First, it is the profundity of practice. Non-discriminating wisdom internally realizes the two emptinesses, free from all discrimination, without any subject or object of practice as its aspect of practice, thus it is called the profundity of practice. Therefore, the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra says, Not seeing practice, not seeing non-practice, this is called the bodhisattva practicing profound prajna.

First, Bhāviveka, relying on the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and the teachings of Nāgārjuna, established a contemplation method, namely the contemplation of emptiness by eliminating characteristics of phenomena, asserting that all dharmas are completely empty, unborn, unceasing, originally quiescent, and naturally in nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0544b02_11']	故《般若經》曰，「一切有為法，如夢、幻、泡、影，如露亦如電，應作如是觀」；	故《般若經》曰，「一切有為法，如夢、幻、泡、影，如露亦如電，應作如是觀」；	001	Therefore, the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras say, All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, dew, and lightning. One should contemplate them in this way.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0544b03_16']	又《思益經》云，「以心分別諸法皆邪，不以心分別諸法皆正」；	又《思益經》云，「以心分別諸法皆邪，不以心分別諸法皆正」；	001	Moreover, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says, If one discriminates dharmas with the mind, all are false. If one does not discriminate dharmas with the mind, all are true.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0544b05_3']	又《中論》曰，「若有所不空，應當有空，不空尚不得，何況得於空？	又《中論》曰，「若有所不空，應當有空，不空尚不得，何況得於空？	001	Moreover, the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā says, If there is anything that is not empty, there should be emptiness. Since non-emptiness is not even obtained, how much less is emptiness obtained?
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0544b06_12']	」又《中論》曰，「諸佛或說我，或時說非我，諸法實相中，非我非非我」。	」又《中論》曰，「諸佛或說我，或時說非我，諸法實相中，非我非非我」。	001	The Madhyamaka-śāstra says, The buddhas sometimes speak of the self, and sometimes they speak of non-self. In the true nature of dharmas, there is neither self nor non-self.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0544b08_15']	如是等文，誠證非一，是故清辨《掌珍論》曰，「真性有為空，如幻緣生故，無為無有實，不起似空華」。	如是等文，誠證非一，是故清辨《掌珍論》曰，「真性有為空，如幻緣生故，無為無有實，不起似空華」。	001	There are many such passages as evidence. Therefore, Bhāviveka's Nyāyamukha says, The true nature of conditioned phenomena is empty, because they arise from illusory conditions.

It establishes that all dharmas are both existent and non-existent. The imagined nature is existent in terms of emotions but non-existent in terms of principle. The dependent nature exists due to causes and conditions. The perfected nature exists in terms of principle but is not non-existent.

Herein there is only emptiness, and in that, this also exists. Therefore it is said that all dharmas are neither empty nor not empty, because of existence and nonexistence. Therefore it accords with the middle way.’ There are many such passages that are true evidence.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0544b21_15']	是故《二十唯識》等曰，「非知諸法一切種無乃得名為入法無我，然達愚夫遍計所執自性差別諸法我無，如是乃名入法無我」，敘觀如上，今當釋文。	是故《二十唯識》等曰，「非知諸法一切種無乃得名為入法無我，然達愚夫遍計所執自性差別諸法我無，如是乃名入法無我」，敘觀如上，今當釋文。	001	Therefore the Vimsatikā Vijñaptimātratā Saptati and other texts say, ‘It is not that by knowing that all dharmas are nonexistent one is said to have entered into the non-self of dharmas. Rather, one penetrates to the non-existence of the self of dharmas that is the self-nature and distinctions of dharmas as imagined by the ignorant and ordinary. In this way it is said to be entering into the non-self of dharmas.’ The contemplation is described above. Now I will explain the text.

First, the imagined form is contrasted with the imagined emptiness to form the four propositions. The form that is imagined by the mind is not different from the originally non-existent emptiness that is imagined, and therefore it is said that form is precisely emptiness. The originally non-existent emptiness that is imagined is precisely existent, and therefore it is said that emptiness is precisely form. This is the mutual identity of the same nature.

The imagined real form that depends on the dependent on others is not different from the emptiness that is unreal in the dependent on others, and therefore it is said that form is precisely emptiness. However, the deluded mind grasps at real form in that emptiness, and therefore it is said that emptiness is precisely form.

In the perfectly accomplished nature, form is grasped as real and not different from the emptiness of the perfectly accomplished nature itself. In the emptiness of self-nature, form is grasped as real. Therefore, it is said that form is precisely emptiness, and emptiness is precisely form.

That is to say, the form produced by conditions is not different from the emptiness of different natures in the other-dependent nature. However, this empty nature is obstructive.

Because it is compared with different natures, it is not different from the previous explanation. When compared with the emptiness of self-nature, there are also four propositions. That is to say, the form produced by conditions takes suchness as its essence. However, that empty nature is not different from the other-dependent nature.

Therefore it is said that form is precisely emptiness and emptiness is precisely form.

['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546a22_18']	顯六相中，命舍利子，如上已釋，六相即是不生、不滅、不垢、不淨、不增、不減。	顯六相中，命舍利子，如上已釋，六相即是不生、不滅、不垢、不淨、不增、不減。	001	Within the illustration of the six characteristics, [the Buddha] commands Śāriputra, as explained above. The six characteristics are precisely non-arising, non-extinguishing, non-defiled, non-pure, non-increasing, and non-decreasing.

The defiled nature that is not pure is called defiled, and the separation from defilement that is not defiled is called pure, as various teachings explain. The grasping of the function of dharmas is called increasing, and the false reckoning of the destruction of dharmas is called decreasing, as the Mahāyānasaṃgraha Śāstra explains.

['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b03_1']	一曰，此文約性辨三，遍計所執本來無故不生不滅，依他起性從緣生故不垢不淨，圓成實性以不起故不增不減。	一曰，此文約性辨三，遍計所執本來無故不生不滅，依他起性從緣生故不垢不淨，圓成實性以不起故不增不減。	001	One says: This text distinguishes the three according to nature, that is, because the imagined is originally non-existent it is unborn and unceasing, because the dependent arises from conditions it is not defiled and not pure, and because the perfected does not arise it is neither increased nor decreased.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b04_9']	一曰，此說三對六相，一一皆通諸位、諸性，總遣三性，無所存故。	一曰，此說三對六相，一一皆通諸位、諸性，總遣三性，無所存故。	001	One says: This explains the three corresponding to the six characteristics, each of which is common to all stages and natures, comprehensively dispelling the three natures, because there is nothing left.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b04_19']	三中後勝，順本宗故。	三中後勝，順本宗故。	001	Among the three, the latter is superior, because it accords with the fundamental tenet.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b07_19']	依護法宗，理實空相乃有眾多，謂非一異及有無等，而經且說三對六者，生滅即是有為通相，垢淨止辨諸法自性，增減言顯法上義用。	依護法宗，理實空相乃有眾多，謂非一異及有無等，而經且說三對六者，生滅即是有為通相，垢淨止辨諸法自性，增減言顯法上義用。	001	According to the Dharmapāla school, in reality there are many characteristics of emptiness, namely, non-one, non-different, non-existence, non-non-existence, etc., but the sūtra only mentions three pairs of six. Arising and ceasing are the general characteristics of conditioned phenomena, defilement and purity distinguish the intrinsic nature of dharmas, and increase and decrease indicate the meaning and function of dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b09_15']	理實三空通有六相，經意正顯是自性空，生、法二空所顯真理通與迷悟為所依故。	理實三空通有六相，經意正顯是自性空，生、法二空所顯真理通與迷悟為所依故。	001	In reality, the three kinds of emptiness have six characteristics, but the meaning of the sūtra is to manifest the emptiness of self-nature, because the true reality manifested by the emptiness of dharmas and the emptiness of self is generally the basis for delusion and enlightenment.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b11_7']	「是故空中無色，無受、想、行、識」者，自下第二依前空相遣六門法。	「是故空中無色，無受、想、行、識」者，自下第二依前空相遣六門法。	001	Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness, is the second part, which relies on the previous characteristics of emptiness to eliminate the six aspects of dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b13_5']	遣六門法即分為六，此即第一遣五蘊門，謂諸法空具六種相，是故空中無五蘊法。	遣六門法即分為六，此即第一遣五蘊門，謂諸法空具六種相，是故空中無五蘊法。	001	Eliminating the six aspects of dharmas is divided into six parts, this is the first part, which eliminates the five aggregates. The emptiness of all dharmas has six characteristics, therefore, in emptiness there are no five aggregates.
['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b14_14']	五蘊義別如前已釋，此中所說六門法者，總顯二乘通、別二境。	五蘊義別如前已釋，此中所說六門法者，總顯二乘通、別二境。	001	The meaning of the five aggregates has already been explained above. The six aspects of dharmas mentioned here generally manifest the common and specific objects of the two vehicles.

['ZH_T33_1711_001:0546b16_15']	依前法性，隨根別說緣生等門，是故後三名為別境。	依前法性，隨根別說緣生等門，是故後三名為別境。	001	Based on the previous nature of dharmas, the teachings of dependent origination, etc. are given separately according to faculties, therefore the latter three are called the specific realms.

It is said that the six sense organs and objects give rise to all mental and mental factors, therefore they are called sense bases. Among the six explanations, this is a compound word with the number.
