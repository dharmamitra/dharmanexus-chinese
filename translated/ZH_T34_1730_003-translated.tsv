Apart from characteristics means apart from false characteristics, apart from nature means apart from the true nature. Because it is apart from false characteristics, false characteristics are empty.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0990c21_2']	一切境界意言分別者，六道果境無非意變故。	一切境界意言分別者，六道果境無非意變故。	As for all realms being conceptualized by the mind, the fruits and realms of the six paths are all transformations of the mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0990c22_1']	由心亂動不能制故，變作因果流轉苦海。	由心亂動不能制故，變作因果流轉苦海。	Because of the mind's agitation and inability to control it, it transforms into causes and effects, flowing and turning in the sea of suffering.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0990c23_11']	是故欲度苦海，修菩薩道，制心一如、眾緣斷滅，所以菩薩修無名相。	是故欲度苦海，修菩薩道，制心一如、眾緣斷滅，所以菩薩修無名相。	Therefore, if one wishes to cross the sea of suffering and cultivate the bodhisattva path, one controls the mind to be like one, and the myriad conditions are extinguished. This is why the bodhisattva cultivates the nameless.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0990c26_3']	一本不起者，三戒之本是一本覺，本來寂靜故曰不起。	一本不起者，三戒之本是一本覺，本來寂靜故曰不起。	As for the one root does not arise, the root of the three precepts is the one original enlightenment, which is originally tranquil, thus it is said to be non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0990c28_4']	三用無施者，既依本覺成三戒用，用離威儀施作相故，無施作故順住一本，故言住於如理。	三用無施者，既依本覺成三戒用，用離威儀施作相故，無施作故順住一本，故言住於如理。	As for the three functions are not applied, since the three precepts are established based on original enlightenment, the functions are free from the characteristics of deportment and activity, and because they are not applied, they accord with abiding in the one root. Therefore, it is said to abide in the principle.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0990c29_1']	既住如理，消除有因，故言六道門杜。	既住如理，消除有因，故言六道門杜。	Since one abides in the principle, the causes of existence are eliminated, thus it is said to block the doors of the six paths.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a01_10']	於一如理具四緣力，能順一如即具三戒，故言四緣如順三戒具足。	於一如理具四緣力，能順一如即具三戒，故言四緣如順三戒具足。	Within the one principle, possessing the power of the four conditions, one is able to accord with the one suchness and possess the three precepts, thus it is said to the four conditions accord with the three precepts being complete.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a12_16']	初中言四緣者，謂於一心本覺利中具四力用，作三戒緣：	初中言四緣者，謂於一心本覺利中具四力用，作三戒緣：	In the beginning, the four objects refer to the four powers and functions within the one mind of fundamental enlightenment, which serve as the three causes for the precepts:
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a14_1']	一滅依止緣、二生依止緣、三攝依止緣、四離依止緣。	一滅依止緣、二生依止緣、三攝依止緣、四離依止緣。	First, the object of cessation and support; second, the object of birth and support; third, the object of embracing and support; fourth, the object of separation and support.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a15_13']	滅依止者，謂本覺中性靜功德，與諸煩惱自性相違，以是緣成攝律儀戒。	滅依止者，謂本覺中性靜功德，與諸煩惱自性相違，以是緣成攝律儀戒。	The basis of cessation refers to the qualities of inherent quiescence in original enlightenment, which are fundamentally incompatible with afflictions, and constitute the precepts of restraining from wrongdoing through dependent origination.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a17_6']	生依止者，謂本覺中性善功德，與諸善根自性相順，以是緣成攝善法戒。	生依止者，謂本覺中性善功德，與諸善根自性相順，以是緣成攝善法戒。	The basis of arising refers to the qualities of inherent goodness in original enlightenment, which are fundamentally compatible with wholesome roots, and constitute the precepts of cultivating wholesome dharmas through dependent origination.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a18_19']	攝依止者，謂本覺中性成大悲，自性不捨一切眾生，以是緣成攝眾生戒。	攝依止者，謂本覺中性成大悲，自性不捨一切眾生，以是緣成攝眾生戒。	The basis of embracing refers to the inherent great compassion in original enlightenment, which never abandons any sentient being, and constitutes the precepts of benefiting sentient beings through dependent origination.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a21_2']	離依止者，謂本覺中性成般若，自性捨離一切事相，以是因緣令三聚戒捨離事相順如而住。	離依止者，謂本覺中性成般若，自性捨離一切事相，以是因緣令三聚戒捨離事相順如而住。	The basis of separation refers to the inherent prajñā in original enlightenment, which naturally abandons all phenomenal characteristics, and causes the three collections of precepts to abandon phenomenal characteristics and abide in accordance with suchness.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a21_12']	前三別緣，後一通緣。	前三別緣，後一通緣。	The former three are specific conditions, while the latter one is a general condition.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a22_19']	菩薩發心受三戒時，順本覺利而受持故，以是四緣具足三戒。	菩薩發心受三戒時，順本覺利而受持故，以是四緣具足三戒。	When bodhisattvas arouse the mind of enlightenment and receive the three precepts, they receive and uphold them in accordance with the benefits of original enlightenment. Therefore, these four conditions are complete in the three precepts.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a23_9']	大意如是，次消其文。	大意如是，次消其文。	The general meaning is like this, and next, the text is explained.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a25_7']	一謂作擇滅力取緣者，本覺本離煩惱繫縛，舉體而作擇滅解脫，有力能取別解脫戒。	一謂作擇滅力取緣者，本覺本離煩惱繫縛，舉體而作擇滅解脫，有力能取別解脫戒。	The first is the power of taking the object of cessation through discrimination, which means that the fundamentally enlightened mind is originally free from the bonds of afflictions, and its entire essence becomes the liberation of cessation through discrimination, with the power to take the precepts of individual liberation.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a26_15']	如似磁石引取於針，雖無作意而有力用，當知此中道理亦爾。	如似磁石引取於針，雖無作意而有力用，當知此中道理亦爾。	It is like a magnet attracting a needle, which, although without intention, has a powerful function. One should know that the principle here is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991a29_16']	二謂本利淨根力所集起緣者，謂本覺本來性淨功德，與諸行德而作根本，由此根力起諸善法，為所集起善法之緣，即此緣成攝善法戒。	二謂本利淨根力所集起緣者，謂本覺本來性淨功德，與諸行德而作根本，由此根力起諸善法，為所集起善法之緣，即此緣成攝善法戒。	The second is the object of accumulation arising from the power of the originally pure roots, which means that the fundamentally enlightened mind's originally pure virtuous qualities serve as the fundamental basis for all practices. Based on this power of the roots, various wholesome dharmas arise, becoming the conditions for the accumulation of wholesome dharmas, which is the precept of accumulating wholesome dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b03_1']	三謂本慧大悲力緣攝眾生戒者，謂本覺中照俗之慧，即是大悲恒潤眾生，以是緣成攝眾生戒。	三謂本慧大悲力緣攝眾生戒者，謂本覺中照俗之慧，即是大悲恒潤眾生，以是緣成攝眾生戒。	The third is the precept of embracing sentient beings through the power of the fundamentally enlightened mind's great compassion, which means that the wisdom of illuminating the conventional truth within the fundamentally enlightened mind is precisely the great compassion that always benefits sentient beings, serving as the precept of embracing sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b04_14']	四謂一覺通智力緣順於如住者，謂本覺中照通性智，令三聚戒皆順如住。	四謂一覺通智力緣順於如住者，謂本覺中照通性智，令三聚戒皆順如住。	The fourth is the power of wisdom that universally illuminates, which is the wisdom of illuminating the nature within original enlightenment, causing the three collections of precepts to all accord with the abiding suchness.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b05_14']	如是四緣體遍法界、用攝萬行，故言大力。	如是四緣體遍法界、用攝萬行，故言大力。	These four conditions pervade the Dharma realm in essence and encompass myriad practices in function, thus they are called great power.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b06_19']	雖有大力而同一味，離諸名相差別事用，故言不住事相。	雖有大力而同一味，離諸名相差別事用，故言不住事相。	Although they have great power, they are of the same flavor, free from the distinctions of names, characteristics, and functional activities, thus they are said to not abide in phenomenal characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b08_5']	雖無事相而有勝能，能攝出世一切行德，故言不無功用。	雖無事相而有勝能，能攝出世一切行德，故言不無功用。	Although there are no phenomenal characteristics, there is superior ability, which can encompass all supramundane practices and virtues, thus it is said to not be without skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b09_15']	由如是故只是本覺，於俗法中無如是義，故言離於一處即不可求。	由如是故只是本覺，於俗法中無如是義，故言離於一處即不可求。	For this reason, it is only original enlightenment. There is no such meaning in conventional dharmas, thus it is said that apart from this one place, it cannot be sought.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b10_14']	上來別明三聚戒緣，自下明其通攝萬行。	上來別明三聚戒緣，自下明其通攝萬行。	Up to this point, the conditions for the three collections of precepts have been specifically explained. From here on, it explains how they comprehensively encompass myriad practices.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0991b12_12']	始從十信乃至等覺，如是六位所有諸行，皆是一覺之所攝成，故言一事通攝六行。	始從十信乃至等覺，如是六位所有諸行，皆是一覺之所攝成，故言一事通攝六行。	From the ten stages of faith up to the stage of equivalent enlightenment, the practices in these six stages are all subsumed and accomplished by original enlightenment, thus it is said that one matter comprehensively subsumes the six practices.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992b23_20']	先釋非文、後釋義語。	先釋非文、後釋義語。	First, explaining the non-text; second, explaining the meaningful words.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992b24_18']	釋非文者，謂非空無，非空文故，非無義故。	釋非文者，謂非空無，非空文故，非無義故。	Explaining the non-text means it is neither empty nor non-existent, because the text of emptiness is empty, and because it is not without meaning.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992b25_12']	釋義語者，義合語故，語如義故。	釋義語者，義合語故，語如義故。	Explaining the meaningful words means the meaning matches the words, and the words are as the meaning.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992b27_2', 'ZH_T34_1730_003:0992b28_9']	初釋中言實空不空者，謂說真如實相亦空，如前說言空相亦空故。🔽言實空而不亡其實相之理，故言不空，雖非有實而非無實故。	初釋中言實空不空者，謂說真如實相亦空，如前說言空相亦空故。 言實空而不亡其實相之理，故言不空，雖非有實而非無實故。	In the first explanation, it says truly empty and not empty. It means that the true suchness of reality is also empty, as stated before, because the characteristics of emptiness are also empty.🔽It says truly empty but not losing its true characteristics, so it says not empty. Although it is not truly existent, it is not non-existent.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c01_14']	空實不實者，謂說真空之理是實故言空實，而不存其真空之理故言不實，雖非無空而非有空故。	空實不實者，謂說真空之理是實故言空實，而不存其真空之理故言不實，雖非無空而非有空故。	Empty reality is not real means that the principle of true emptiness is real, so it says empty reality. But it does not retain the principle of true emptiness, so it says not real. Although it is not non-empty, it is not existent emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c03_11']	離於二相中間不中者，不空之語離於空相，不實之語離於實相，故言離於二相。	離於二相中間不中者，不空之語離於空相，不實之語離於實相，故言離於二相。	Free from the two characteristics, neither in the middle nor not in the middle means the words not empty are free from the characteristic of emptiness, and the words not real are free from the characteristic of reality, so it says free from the two characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c04_13']	然空實二相之間不存非二之中，故言中間不中。	然空實二相之間不存非二之中，故言中間不中。	However, between the two aspects of emptiness and reality, there is neither non-duality in the middle, therefore it is said not in the middle.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c05_10']	既離二邊亦不墮中，故言離於三相。	既離二邊亦不墮中，故言離於三相。	Since it is free from the two extremes and also does not fall into the middle, therefore it is said free from the three characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c07_5']	心言行處不過三相，然此佛語遠離三相，即於其中心言路絕，故言不見處所。	心言行處不過三相，然此佛語遠離三相，即於其中心言路絕，故言不見處所。	The mind and speech do not go beyond the three characteristics, yet this Buddha's speech is far removed from the three characteristics, thus the mind and speech paths are cut off, therefore it is said no place is seen.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c08_10']	如是妙契絕言之義，所以不同無義之文，此釋非文也。	如是妙契絕言之義，所以不同無義之文，此釋非文也。	Such wondrous accord with the meaning beyond words is why it is not the same as meaningless texts, this is the explanation of non-text.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c09_1']	如如如說者，是釋義語。	如如如說者，是釋義語。	Just as it is, just as it is said is the explanation of meaningful speech.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c09_15']	上一如是契當，下二如是義理。	上一如是契當，下二如是義理。	The first just as it is accords with reality, the latter two just as it is are the principles of meaning.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c11_12']	如前遠離三相之語，契當如如義理而說，所以佛說乃是義語，不同凡語之非義也。	如前遠離三相之語，契當如如義理而說，所以佛說乃是義語，不同凡語之非義也。	Just as the speech of being far removed from the three characteristics accords with the principles of meaning and is spoken, therefore the Buddha's speech is meaningful speech, unlike ordinary speech which is not meaningful.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c12_12']	如無已下，第二重顯，先顯非文、後顯義語。	如無已下，第二重顯，先顯非文、後顯義語。	Just as there is no... and below is the second reiteration, first revealing non-text and then revealing meaningful speech.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c14_14']	初中言如無無有，無有於無者，謂真如理雖非是有，而如本無令無其有，謂令無有法於無法中。	初中言如無無有，無有於無者，謂真如理雖非是有，而如本無令無其有，謂令無有法於無法中。	In the first, it says as non-existence is not non-existent, non-existence is in non-existence. This means that although the principle of suchness is not existent, it is as originally non-existent, causing it to be without existence. This means that there is no dharma in the midst of no dharma.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c14_19']	所以然者？	所以然者？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c15_13']	如本非有，無於何有而墮無耶？	如本非有，無於何有而墮無耶？	Since it is originally not existent, what existence is there in non-existence that would fall into non-existence?
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c16_6']	是故合於實空不空之語也。	是故合於實空不空之語也。	Therefore, it combines the words truly empty and not empty.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c18_6']	如無有無，有無於有者，謂真如理雖非是無，而如本無令有其無，謂令有無法於有法中。	如無有無，有無於有者，謂真如理雖非是無，而如本無令有其無，謂令有無法於有法中。	As existence is not existent, existence is in existence. This means that although the principle of suchness is not non-existence, it is as originally non-existent, causing it to have non-existence. This means that there is existent dharma in the midst of existent dharma.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c18_11']	所以然者？	所以然者？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c19_5']	如本非無，有於何無而墮有耶？	如本非無，有於何無而墮有耶？	Since it is originally not non-existent, what non-existence is there in existence that would fall into existence?
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c19_16']	是故合於空實不實之語。	是故合於空實不實之語。	Therefore, it combines the words empty and not empty.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c20_13']	有無不在者，如無有無，故有不在；	有無不在者，如無有無，故有不在；	Existence and non-existence are not present. Since existence is not existent, existence is not present;
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c21_2']	如無無有，故無不在。	如無無有，故無不在。	since non-existence is not non-existent, non-existence is not absent.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c21_12']	二既不在，何得有中？	二既不在，何得有中？	Since the two are not present, how can there be a middle?
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c22_1']	即合離於三相之語。	即合離於三相之語。	It combines the words of the three characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c23_8']	如義既爾合於義語，是故佛語實非空文，如是重顯非文釋也。	如義既爾合於義語，是故佛語實非空文，如是重顯非文釋也。	As the meaning is like this, it accords with meaningful speech. Therefore, the Buddha's words are truly not empty words. This is the explanation of the non-textual interpretation.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c24_7']	佛說名言如是當理，故後得智帶如是名。	佛說名言如是當理，故後得智帶如是名。	The Buddha's spoken words are like this and accord with principle, therefore the subsequently attained wisdom is imbued with such names.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c25_12']	思惟真如即得親觀真如理體，故在四句之中俱句也。	思惟真如即得親觀真如理體，故在四句之中俱句也。	Contemplating true suchness, one immediately attains the intimate observation of the essence of the principle of true suchness, therefore it is in the fourth statement, the statement of both.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0992c29_14']	第二重顯義語中言說不在故不在於如者，佛語既說有無不在故不在有無，於真如理，有不在者不有如故、無不在者不無如故，則當不有如、不無如而說，故言如不有如不無如說。	第二重顯義語中言說不在故不在於如者，佛語既說有無不在故不在有無，於真如理，有不在者不有如故、無不在者不無如故，則當不有如、不無如而說，故言如不有如不無如說。	In the second重顯義語, the text says because speech is not in, it is not in suchness. Since the Buddha's words speak of existence and non-existence not being in, they are not in existence and non-existence. In the principle of true suchness, that which is not in existence is not existent suchness, and that which is not in non-existence is not non-existent suchness. Therefore, it should be spoken of as not existent suchness and not non-existent suchness. Therefore, it says speaking of suchness as not existent suchness and not non-existent suchness.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0993a01_13']	是故前言如如如說，如是重顯義語之釋。	是故前言如如如說，如是重顯義語之釋。	Therefore, the previous statement says speaking of suchness as suchness. This is the explanation of the meaningful speech in the重顯.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998b29_11']	今此頌中所言法者，謂一心法，若妄分別動心海故，若生若滅一切諸相，莫不皆從分別所作。	今此頌中所言法者，謂一心法，若妄分別動心海故，若生若滅一切諸相，莫不皆從分別所作。	Now, in this verse, the so-called Dharma refers to the Dharma of the one mind. If there is false discrimination, it agitates the ocean of the mind, and all phenomena of arising and ceasing are all produced from discrimination.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c01_12']	若就本覺，本來靜門離諸分別，故是法非生滅。	若就本覺，本來靜門離諸分別，故是法非生滅。	If based on original enlightenment, it is the originally quiescent gate that is apart from all discrimination, and therefore it is the Dharma that is neither arising nor ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c02_12']	謂從本來滅諸分別，無生滅因，故非生滅。	謂從本來滅諸分別，無生滅因，故非生滅。	It means that from the very beginning, it ceases all discrimination and has no cause for arising or ceasing, and therefore it is neither arising nor ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c03_16']	若使生之與滅皆從分別之所作者，瑜伽所說云何而通？	若使生之與滅皆從分別之所作者，瑜伽所說云何而通？	If arising and ceasing are both produced by discrimination, how can we understand the Yogācāra teachings?
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c04_17']	如彼思所成地中云「無滅他用，無自滅用。	如彼思所成地中云「無滅他用，無自滅用。	As the Sīx Kinds of Non-arising says: There is no cessation of the function of others, and no self-cessation function.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c06_8']	眾緣有故生，生已自然滅。	眾緣有故生，生已自然滅。	Arising due to the existence of many conditions, having arisen it naturally ceases.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c17_2']	一者二句演彼下半；	一者二句演彼下半；	First, two lines expound the lower half;

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c18_1']	三者一頌總演二義。	三者一頌總演二義。	Third, one verse comprehensively expounds the two meanings.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c19_2']	初言諸法本寂滅者，謂陰界等法本來寂滅故。	初言諸法本寂滅者，謂陰界等法本來寂滅故。	The first says all dharmas are originally quiescent and extinguished means that the dharmas such as the aggregates and realms are originally quiescent and extinguished.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c20_7']	寂滅亦無生者，非但諸法本來寂滅，寂滅之理亦無生故。	寂滅亦無生者，非但諸法本來寂滅，寂滅之理亦無生故。	Quiescence and extinction are also unborn means that not only are all dharmas originally quiescent and extinguished, the principle of quiescence and extinction is also unborn.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c21_8']	第二中言是諸生滅法者，謂陰界等世俗法故。	第二中言是諸生滅法者，謂陰界等世俗法故。	In the second, it says these dharmas of arising and ceasing means the conventional dharmas such as the aggregates and realms.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c23_4']	是法非無生者，從分別動有生起故，是就真俗非一之門以顯動靜不雜亂義。	是法非無生者，從分別動有生起故，是就真俗非一之門以顯動靜不雜亂義。	These dharmas are not unborn means that from the movement of discrimination there is arising, which is from the perspective of the conventional and ultimate not being one, to show the meaning of movement and stillness not being confused.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c24_15']	第三中言彼即不共此者，謂彼寂滅無生之法，不與此生滅法共並故。	第三中言彼即不共此者，謂彼寂滅無生之法，不與此生滅法共並故。	In the third, it says they are not the same as this means that the dharma of quiescence and extinction that is unborn is not the same as this dharma of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c27_1']	為有斷常故者，若彼與此共並有者，此法生滅即有斷邊，彼法常寂即有常邊，同二乘過，乖中道故。	為有斷常故者，若彼與此共並有者，此法生滅即有斷邊，彼法常寂即有常邊，同二乘過，乖中道故。	Because of existence and annihilation means that if they were the same as this, this dharma of arising and ceasing would have the extreme of annihilation, and that dharma of eternal quiescence would have the extreme of permanence, the same as the error of the two vehicles, because it would contradict the middle way.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c27_16']	然佛所說一偈之義，不墮斷常故。	然佛所說一偈之義，不墮斷常故。	However, the meaning of a single verse spoken by the Buddha does not fall into annihilationism or eternalism.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c28_14']	此即離於二，不無動靜故，亦不在一住。	此即離於二，不無動靜故，亦不在一住。	This is precisely the avoidance of duality, because there is no absence of movement and stillness, and it also does not abide in oneness.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0998c29_8']	不在一住者，不守一實一心性故。	不在一住者，不守一實一心性故。	Not abiding in oneness means not guarding the single true nature of the one mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a01_3']	離於二者，舉體動靜非二法故。	離於二者，舉體動靜非二法故。	Avoiding duality means that the entire body's movement and stillness are not two dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a01_12']	當知是事不可思議。	當知是事不可思議。	One should know that this matter is inconceivable.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a04_7']	若見於法無，是法同於空，如盲無日倒，說法如龜毛。	若見於法無，是法同於空，如盲無日倒，說法如龜毛。	If it is seen that dharmas are non-existent, this dharma is the same as emptiness, like a blind person without the sun, speaking of dharmas like a turtle's hair.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a06_8']	邪解雖多，大邪有二，依甚深教如言取義，自謂究竟，難可化故。	邪解雖多，大邪有二，依甚深教如言取義，自謂究竟，難可化故。	Although wrong understandings are many, there are two major ones. Relying on the profound teachings, grasping the meaning literally, considering it to be ultimate, and being difficult to transform.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a07_17']	一者聞佛所說動靜無二，便謂是一一實一心，由是誹撥二諦道理。	一者聞佛所說動靜無二，便謂是一一實一心，由是誹撥二諦道理。	First, hearing the Buddha say that movement and stillness are non-dual, they immediately take it to be a single, real mind. Because of this, they slander the principle of the two truths.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a09_8']	二者聞佛所說空有二門，計有二法而無一實，由此誹撥無二中道。	二者聞佛所說空有二門，計有二法而無一實，由此誹撥無二中道。	Second, hearing the Buddha say that emptiness and existence are two gates, they take them to be two dharmas and not a single reality. Because of this, they slander the non-dual middle way.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a10_3']	是二邪解，服藥成病，甚難可治。	是二邪解，服藥成病，甚難可治。	These two mistaken understandings, like taking medicine that turns into an illness, are extremely difficult to cure.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a10_17']	今顯彼過，此二頌中次第顯之。	今顯彼過，此二頌中次第顯之。	Now, to reveal their faults, these two verses will show them in order.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a12_6']	初言若說法有一者，謂如前說計有一實，如自所計說有一法故。	初言若說法有一者，謂如前說計有一實，如自所計說有一法故。	First, it says, If it is said that the dharma has one, referring to the previously mentioned idea of a single reality, because it is said that there is a single dharma according to one's own understanding.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a13_12']	是相如毛輪者，謂彼所計一實法相，如目曀者所見毛輪故。	是相如毛輪者，謂彼所計一實法相，如目曀者所見毛輪故。	Its characteristics are like a hair wheel, meaning that the characteristics of the single real dharma that they conceive are like a hair wheel seen by one with an eye disease.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a15_7']	如焰水迷倒者，謂如渴鹿見焰謂水，馳走而求直是迷倒，計有一心亦如是故。	如焰水迷倒者，謂如渴鹿見焰謂水，馳走而求直是迷倒，計有一心亦如是故。	Like a deluded one who mistakes a mirage for water, meaning that just as a thirsty deer sees a mirage and takes it to be water, running to seek it is simply delusion, and the conception of a single mind is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a16_17']	為諸虛妄故者，渴鹿見水、曀者見輪、學士計一，如是諸計齊虛妄故。	為諸虛妄故者，渴鹿見水、曀者見輪、學士計一，如是諸計齊虛妄故。	Because of all false imaginations means that a thirsty deer sees water, one with cataracts sees a wheel, and a scholar conceives of oneness - all such conceptions are the same in being false.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a17_2']	次破無見。	次破無見。	Next, refuting the view of non-existence.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a18_4']	若見於法無者，謂如前說計有二諦，無一心法故。	若見於法無者，謂如前說計有二諦，無一心法故。	If one sees the non-existence of dharmas means as previously explained, conceiving of the existence of the two truths, there is no single dharma of mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a19_11']	是法同於空者，彼計一心同於空理，空理之外本無一實故。	是法同於空者，彼計一心同於空理，空理之外本無一實故。	This dharma is the same as emptiness means that they conceive of the single mind as being the same as the principle of emptiness, because outside the principle of emptiness there is originally no single reality.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a22_1']	如盲無日倒者，謂如生盲貧窮乞兒，本未曾見日輪光明，其有目者為說有日，盲者謂無、不信有日，直是顛倒。	如盲無日倒者，謂如生盲貧窮乞兒，本未曾見日輪光明，其有目者為說有日，盲者謂無、不信有日，直是顛倒。	Like the blind without the sun, the inverted means that a congenitally blind poor beggar has never seen the sun's light, and although those with eyes tell them there is a sun, the blind say it does not exist and do not believe in the sun, which is simply inverted.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a23_13']	彼計亦爾，由彼本來唯學空有，而未曾聞無二中道，雖有說者不信受故。	彼計亦爾，由彼本來唯學空有，而未曾聞無二中道，雖有說者不信受故。	Their conception is also like this. Because they have originally only studied emptiness and existence, and have never heard of the middle way beyond duality, even if there are those who speak of it, they do not believe or accept it.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a25_3']	所以日輪喻於中道者，日輪圓滿有大光明，唯除盲者無不見故。	所以日輪喻於中道者，日輪圓滿有大光明，唯除盲者無不見故。	The reason the sun is used as a metaphor for the middle way is because the sun is perfectly round and has great light, and only the blind do not see it.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a26_12']	一心亦爾，周圓無缺，有本始覺大光明照，除不信者，無不入故。	一心亦爾，周圓無缺，有本始覺大光明照，除不信者，無不入故。	The same is true for the one mind, which is perfect and complete without any deficiency. When it is illuminated by the great bright light of original and subsequently-attained enlightenment, there is none who does not enter it, except those who lack faith.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999a28_7']	說法如龜毛者，彼無見者說一心法但名無體猶如龜毛，不異盲人謂無日輪也。	說法如龜毛者，彼無見者說一心法但名無體猶如龜毛，不異盲人謂無日輪也。	As for speaking of the Dharma as being like a turtle's hair, those who do not see it say that the Dharma of the one mind is merely without substance, like a turtle's hair, no different from the blind person who thinks there is no sun.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b01_4']	經曰　「我今聞佛說，知法非二見，亦不依中住，故從無住取。	經曰　「我今聞佛說，知法非二見，亦不依中住，故從無住取。	The sūtra says: I now hear the Buddha's teaching and know that the Dharma is not seen in duality. I also do not abide in the middle, and therefore take it from the unconditioned.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b01_8']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b01_17']	此是第三自申正取。	此是第三自申正取。	This is the third statement of one's own correct understanding.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b03_7']	知法非二見者，知中道法非有無解之所見故，即離第二無日之倒。	知法非二見者，知中道法非有無解之所見故，即離第二無日之倒。	Knowing that the Dharma is not seen in duality means knowing that the Dharma of the middle way is not seen by the understanding of existence or non-existence, and thus one is free from the second delusion of no sun.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b04_17']	亦不依中住者，雖離二邊不存中道一實而住，即離第一輪水之妄。	亦不依中住者，雖離二邊不存中道一實而住，即離第一輪水之妄。	Not abiding in the middle means that although one is free from the two extremes, one does not dwell in the one true middle way, and thus one is free from the first delusion of the water of the wheel.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b06_15']	如是離彼二邊過失，故從佛教無住之詮領解所詮無住之旨，故言故從無住取也。	如是離彼二邊過失，故從佛教無住之詮領解所詮無住之旨，故言故從無住取也。	Thus, by avoiding these two extreme faults, one understands the meaning of non-abiding as taught by the Buddha, and therefore it is said that one takes it from non-abiding.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b07_15']	經曰　「如來所說法，悉從於無住。	經曰　「如來所說法，悉從於無住。	The sūtra says: The Dharma taught by the Tathāgata all arises from non-abiding.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b12_18']	初中言如來所說法悉從於無住者，謂佛教法順從無住故。	初中言如來所說法悉從於無住者，謂佛教法順從無住故。	In the beginning, it says The Dharma taught by the Tathāgata all arises from non-abiding, meaning that the Buddhist teachings accord with non-abiding.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b14_12']	我從無住處是處禮如來者，依教得從於無住處，彌知如來最可尊重故。	我從無住處是處禮如來者，依教得從於無住處，彌知如來最可尊重故。	I take refuge in the Tathāgata, the place of non-abiding, means that by relying on the teachings, one attains the place of non-abiding, and thus knows that the Tathāgata is the most worthy of respect.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b16_15']	於是處禮能說者，此中言無住者，不住二諦亦不在中，雖不在中而離二邊，如是名為無住處也。	於是處禮能說者，此中言無住者，不住二諦亦不在中，雖不在中而離二邊，如是名為無住處也。	Therefore, in this place, paying homage to the one who can speak, here, the words without abiding mean not abiding in the two truths, nor being in between them. Although not being in between, it is apart from the two extremes. This is called without abiding.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b18_4']	第二中言如來相者，不以相好為如來相，以不動智為如來相。	第二中言如來相者，不以相好為如來相，以不動智為如來相。	In the second, the words the characteristic of the Tathāgata do not take the major and minor marks as the characteristic of the Tathāgata, but take the immovable wisdom as the characteristic of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b19_8']	言等空者，謂如來智無量無邊，等虛空界無所不遍故。	言等空者，謂如來智無量無邊，等虛空界無所不遍故。	The words equal to space mean that the wisdom of the Tathāgata is immeasurable and boundless, equal to the realm of space, and pervades everywhere.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b20_13']	言不動者，遍達一切無邊三世，世有遷流智用不移故。	言不動者，遍達一切無邊三世，世有遷流智用不移故。	The words immovable mean that it thoroughly penetrates all boundless past, present, and future, and the wisdom and function of the mind do not change with the passing of time.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:0999b21_9']	第三中言不著者，法身離二邊故。	第三中言不著者，法身離二邊故。	In the third, the words unattached mean that the Dharma body is apart from the two extremes.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:1005c21_2']	次有四句釋不生義。	次有四句釋不生義。	Next, there are four sentences explaining the meaning of non-production.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:1005c23_13']	生滅性空寂者，以不住故即無生滅，性空寂故亦不生果。	生滅性空寂者，以不住故即無生滅，性空寂故亦不生果。	The nature of arising and ceasing is empty and tranquil means that because they do not abide, there is no arising and ceasing, and because their nature is empty and tranquil, they also do not produce results.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:1005c26_7']	緣性能所緣者，因緣種子冥伏名性，增上緣根能對境界故名能緣，所緣境界根所對故名為所緣，次第緣法滅故不論。	緣性能所緣者，因緣種子冥伏名性，增上緣根能對境界故名能緣，所緣境界根所對故名為所緣，次第緣法滅故不論。	As for the nature of conditions and the conditioned, the causal condition of seeds is hidden and called nature, the dominant condition of faculties is able to face objects and is called the able condition, the conditioned object is faced by faculties and is called the conditioned, and the immediate condition of dharmas is not discussed because they have ceased.

['ZH_T34_1730_003:1005c29_1']	是即其本，諸緣亦同前說，生滅性空故無生用。	是即其本，諸緣亦同前說，生滅性空故無生用。	This is precisely the fundamental, and the conditions are also the same as what was explained before, because arising and ceasing are empty of nature, there is no function of arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:1005c29_10']	由是三義緣無生義。	由是三義緣無生義。	For this reason, the meaning of non-arising of conditions is due to these three meanings.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:1006a01_6']	故法起非緣者，結果法起非緣所生。	故法起非緣者，結果法起非緣所生。	Therefore, the arising of dharmas is not due to conditions means that the arising of resultant dharmas is not produced by conditions.
['ZH_T34_1730_003:1006a02_3']	緣無起亦爾者，結緣無起亦同其果。	緣無起亦爾者，結緣無起亦同其果。	The arising of conditions is also like this means that the conclusion that the arising of conditions is also the same as the result.
