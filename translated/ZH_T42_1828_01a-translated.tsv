['ZH_T42_1828_01a:0316b10_4']	對法中空一顯色與逈色不同。	對法中空一顯色與逈色不同。	In the Abhidharma, the one apparent color of space and the form of space are different.
['ZH_T42_1828_01a:0316b10_9']	所以然者。	所以然者。	The reason for this is as follows:

['ZH_T42_1828_01a:0316b11_3', 'ZH_T42_1828_01a:0316b11_15']	是故別說。🔽謂在上空現者名空一顯色。	是故別說。 謂在上空現者名空一顯色。	Therefore it is discussed separately.🔽It is said that the one apparent color of space that appears above🔽is called the one apparent color of space.
['ZH_T42_1828_01a:0316b12_8']	若近下逈處現者名為逈色。	若近下逈處現者名為逈色。	If it appears near the space below, it is called the form of space.

['ZH_T42_1828_01a:0316b20_12']	故此論說顯色有十三形色有其十種。	故此論說顯色有十三形色有其十種。	Therefore this treatise says apparent colors have thirteen, shaped colors have ten kinds.
['ZH_T42_1828_01a:0316b21_1']	表色謂屈申等。	表色謂屈申等。	Indicated colors refer to bending, stretching, and so on.
