Arising and ceasing flow rapidly without a moment's pause. Because of similar continuity, they are falsely seen as real, just like the flame of a lamp arising and ceasing moment by moment.

Because there is continuity in the conventional sense of the world, there is no fault of annihilation, and because they do not abide moment by moment, there is no fault of permanence.

Because causes and conditions are empty, all dharmas are empty. Because he understands the emptiness of dharmas, he avoids the errors of annihilationism and eternalism.
