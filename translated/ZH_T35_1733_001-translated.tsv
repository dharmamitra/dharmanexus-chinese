Among the latter three kinds, the Bodhisattva Canon, it is only correctly included in the latter.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115a11_13']	如此經下〈性起品〉云「譬如日出，先照一切諸大山王，次照一切大山，次照金剛寶山，然後普照一切大地。	如此經下〈性起品〉云「譬如日出，先照一切諸大山王，次照一切大山，次照金剛寶山，然後普照一切大地。	As the chapter on the arising of nature in this sutra says, It is like the sun rising, first illuminating all the great mountain kings, then illuminating all the great mountains, then illuminating the diamond treasure mountain, and then universally illuminating the entire great earth.

He accomplishes the sun-disk of wisdom of the immeasurable and boundless Dharma realm, always emitting the light of immeasurable and unobstructed wisdom, first illuminating the great mountain kings of the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, next illuminating the pratyekabuddhas, next illuminating the śrāvakas, next illuminating the sentient beings with determined wholesome roots, according to their suitability for being transformed, and then universally illuminating all sentient beings, up to those with deviant destinies, creating the causes and conditions for benefiting them in the future.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115a21_1']	如來應供等正覺亦復如是，先起菩薩諸行智慧，次起緣覺聲聞及餘眾生一切善根。	如來應供等正覺亦復如是，先起菩薩諸行智慧，次起緣覺聲聞及餘眾生一切善根。	The Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One is also like this. He first gives rise to the wisdom of the bodhisattvas' practices, and next he gives rise to the wholesome roots of all sentient beings, including the pratyekabuddhas, śrāvakas, and others.

This is explained in terms of the Dharma, showing how the basis gives rise to the branches, not in terms of the capacities of sentient beings, because there is no one who first studies the Great Vehicle and later studies the Lesser Vehicle.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b04_4']	然《深密》、《妙智》既各聖教，不可取一捨一，是故合此二經總有四門：	然《深密》、《妙智》既各聖教，不可取一捨一，是故合此二經總有四門：	However, since the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra and the Sūtra of Sublime Insight are both sacred teachings, one cannot accept one and reject the other. Therefore, combining these two sūtras, there are a total of four approaches:
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b04_15']	一初時小乘，二經同說；	一初時小乘，二經同說；	The first is the initial period of the Lesser Vehicle, which is explained in both sūtras;
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b05_9']	第二時唯大乘，唯《深密》說；	第二時唯大乘，唯《深密》說；	The second period is exclusively the Great Vehicle, which is explained only in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra;

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b07_1']	第四時唯一乘，唯《妙智》第三時說。	第四時唯一乘，唯《妙智》第三時說。	The fourth period is exclusively the One Vehicle, which is explained in the third period of the Sūtra of Sublime Insight alone.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b07_18']	是故當知《妙智經》在《深密》後說。	是故當知《妙智經》在《深密》後說。	Therefore, one should know that the Sūtra of Sublime Insight was taught after the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b11_8']	若謂《妙智經》此土未翻而不信者，彼《深密經》既當第三時教，然許定性二乘及無性有情並不成佛，具足三乘名一切乘者，是即《法華》、《涅槃》既在《深密》後說。	若謂《妙智經》此土未翻而不信者，彼《深密經》既當第三時教，然許定性二乘及無性有情並不成佛，具足三乘名一切乘者，是即《法華》、《涅槃》既在《深密》後說。	If you say that the Sutra of Sublime Insight has not yet been translated in this land and so is not believed, then the Sutra of Profound Secrets is already the third period teaching, yet it allows that those of fixed potential in the two vehicles and those of indeterminate nature will both attain Buddhahood, and it speaks of the complete three vehicles as all vehicles. This means that the Lotus Sutra and Nirvana Sutra, since they were spoken after the Profound Secrets Sutra,
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b13_10']	然定性二乘及無性闡提悉皆成佛，當知即是第四時名一乘教，是故與《妙智經》懸會無疑。	然定性二乘及無性闡提悉皆成佛，當知即是第四時名一乘教，是故與《妙智經》懸會無疑。	yet allow that those of fixed potential in the two vehicles and those of indeterminate nature will all attain Buddhahood, you should know that this is the fourth period teaching of the One Vehicle. Therefore there is no doubt that it is in agreement with the Sutra of Sublime Insight.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b14_11']	又初小乘教，依《法華》等，佛成道後三七日等說。	又初小乘教，依《法華》等，佛成道後三七日等說。	Furthermore, the initial teaching of the Lesser Vehicle, according to the Lotus Sutra and others, was spoken by the Buddha three weeks after his enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b15_21']	依《真諦三藏記》云「佛成道七年後說諸部《般若》，是第二時教。	依《真諦三藏記》云「佛成道七年後說諸部《般若》，是第二時教。	According to the record of Paramārtha's scriptures, it says: The Buddha spoke the various Prajñā[pāramitā] scriptures seven years after his enlightenment, which is the second period teaching.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b19_12']	真諦此說必有聖教，若無聖教豈可自作年數？	真諦此說必有聖教，若無聖教豈可自作年數？	This statement by Paramārtha must have a holy teaching as its basis. If there were no holy teaching, how could he arbitrarily create a chronology?
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b20_16']	若不信此者，即《涅槃經》最居末後是即無疑。	若不信此者，即《涅槃經》最居末後是即無疑。	If one does not believe this, then the Nirvana Sutra, which is at the very end, is undoubtedly so.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b22_14']	然此四時皆前權後實、以後會前，《法華》、《涅槃》會《深密》之三乘，歸究竟一乘，其義決定。	然此四時皆前權後實、以後會前，《法華》、《涅槃》會《深密》之三乘，歸究竟一乘，其義決定。	However, in these four periods, the provisional teachings are all taught first and the true teaching is taught later, with the later teachings reconciling the earlier ones. The Lotus Sutra and Nirvana Sutra reconcile the three vehicles of the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra and reveal the ultimate one vehicle. This meaning is certain.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b23_13']	是故此四從淺至深，明攝末歸本之漸次也。	是故此四從淺至深，明攝末歸本之漸次也。	Therefore, these four periods, from shallow to deep, clarify the gradual return of the branches to the root.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b25_3']	四本末無礙門者，謂初舉照山王之本教，明非本無以起末；	四本末無礙門者，謂初舉照山王之本教，明非本無以起末；	The fourth gate is the gate of the unobstructedness of the root and branches. It means that first, the fundamental teaching of illuminating the king of mountains is brought up, clarifying that without the root, the branches cannot arise;
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115b26_4']	後顯歸大海之異流，明非盡末無以歸本。	後顯歸大海之異流，明非盡末無以歸本。	Later, it reveals the different streams returning to the great ocean, clarifying that without exhausting the branches, there is no way to return to the root.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115c09_11']	此既未盡大乘法理，是故立為大乘始教。	此既未盡大乘法理，是故立為大乘始教。	Since this does not yet exhaust the principle of the Mahāyāna Dharma, it is established as the initial teaching of the Mahāyāna.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115c11_6']	三終教者，定性二乘無性闡提悉當成佛，方盡大乘至極之說，立為終教。	三終教者，定性二乘無性闡提悉當成佛，方盡大乘至極之說，立為終教。	As for the third teaching, those of fixed lesser vehicle lineages and those of indeterminate nature will all become buddhas, and only then does it reach the ultimate teaching of the Mahāyāna, so it is established as the final teaching.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115c12_6']	然上二教，並依地位漸次修成，俱名漸教。	然上二教，並依地位漸次修成，俱名漸教。	However, the above two teachings both rely on gradual cultivation through the stages of the grounds, so they are both called gradual teachings.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115c13_15']	四頓教者，但一念不生即名為佛，不依位地漸次而說，故立為頓。	四頓教者，但一念不生即名為佛，不依位地漸次而說，故立為頓。	As for the fourth sudden teaching, it is simply that a single thought of nonarising is called buddhahood, and it is taught without relying on the stages of the grounds, so it is established as sudden.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115c14_19']	如《思益》云「得諸法正性者，不從一地至於一地。	如《思益》云「得諸法正性者，不從一地至於一地。	As the Vimalakīrti-sūtra says, One who attains the true nature of dharmas does not go from one ground to another ground.

Therefore, at the end of the ten faiths, the five stages are subsumed and perfect enlightenment is attained, etc. It relies on the complete host and companion of the net of the Dharma realm of universal virtue and is therefore called the perfect teaching. It is explained in this sutra and other texts.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115c23_5']	若約所說法相等者，初小乘法相有七十五法、識唯有六，所說不盡法原，多起異諍，如小乘諸部經論說。	若約所說法相等者，初小乘法相有七十五法、識唯有六，所說不盡法原，多起異諍，如小乘諸部經論說。	If it is based on the characteristics of the taught Dharma, etc., the first small vehicle Dharma characteristics have seventy-five dharmas and only six consciousnesses. What is taught does not exhaust the origin of dharmas and gives rise to many different disputes, as explained in the sutras and treatises of the various small vehicle schools.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0115c26_16']	二始教中廣說法相、小說真性，所立百法決擇分明故無違諍，所說八識唯是生滅法相，名數多同小乘，固非究竟玄妙之說，如《瑜伽》、《雜集》等說。	二始教中廣說法相、小說真性，所立百法決擇分明故無違諍，所說八識唯是生滅法相，名數多同小乘，固非究竟玄妙之說，如《瑜伽》、《雜集》等說。	Second, in the initial teaching, the characteristics of dharmas are explained in detail, and the true nature is explained less. The established one hundred dharmas are clearly distinguished, so there is no contradiction or dispute. The eight consciousnesses explained are only dharmas of arising and ceasing, with many of the same names and numbers as the lesser vehicle, certainly not the profound and wondrous teachings of the ultimate truth, as explained in the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, the Abhidharmasamuccaya, and so forth.

It also does not discuss the one hundred dharmas or their names and numbers in detail, and is also different from the lesser vehicle and does not have many approaches, as explained in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, the Ratnagotravibhāga, and other treatises.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0116a06_3']	四頓教中，總不說法相唯辯真性，亦無八識差別之相，一切所有唯是妄想，一切法實唯是絕言，呵教勸離毀相泯心，生心即妄、不生即佛，亦無佛無不佛、無生無不生，如淨名默住顯不二等是其意也。	四頓教中，總不說法相唯辯真性，亦無八識差別之相，一切所有唯是妄想，一切法實唯是絕言，呵教勸離毀相泯心，生心即妄、不生即佛，亦無佛無不佛、無生無不生，如淨名默住顯不二等是其意也。	In the fourth sudden teaching, it does not speak of dharmas at all, only discussing the true nature. It also has no characteristics of the distinctions of the eight consciousnesses. All that exists is only false imagination, and the reality of all dharmas is only beyond words. It criticizes the teachings, encourages detachment, destroys characteristics, and obliterates the mind. Giving rise to the mind is delusion, not giving rise to it is Buddha. There is also no Buddha, no non-Buddha, no arising, and no non-arising. It is like the meaning of Vimalakīrti's silent sitting to manifest non-duality and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0116a09_6']	五圓教中，所說唯是無盡法界，性海圓融緣起無礙，相即相入，如因陀羅網重重無際微細相容主伴無盡，十十法門各稱法界，具如下說。	五圓教中，所說唯是無盡法界，性海圓融緣起無礙，相即相入，如因陀羅網重重無際微細相容主伴無盡，十十法門各稱法界，具如下說。	In the fifth perfect teaching, what is spoken is only the inexhaustible Dharma realm, the perfect interfusion of the ocean of nature, the unobstructed dependent arising, the mutual inclusion of characteristics, like the Indra's net with layers upon layers without end, the subtle mutual containment, the host and companions being inexhaustible. The ten sets of ten Dharma gates each correspond to the Dharma realm, as will be explained below.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117a16_13']	以盧舍那周遍塵方普應法界一切群機。	以盧舍那周遍塵方普應法界一切群機。	Because Vairocana pervades the dust motes and universally responds to all beings in the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117a18_10']	若彼別機稱自根器，但各見己所見、聞自所聞，皆不見他所見、不聞他所聞。	若彼別機稱自根器，但各見己所見、聞自所聞，皆不見他所見、不聞他所聞。	If those with different capacities correspond to their own faculties, they each only see what they see and hear what they hear, and they do not see what others see or hear what others hear.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117a20_8']	此普賢機，乃見一切所見、聞一切所聞，皆盡盧舍那能化分齊，故云普眼境也。	此普賢機，乃見一切所見、聞一切所聞，皆盡盧舍那能化分齊，故云普眼境也。	This Samantabhadra capacity, however, sees all that is seen and hears all that is heard, and it exhausts the extent of Vairocana's ability to transform, therefore it is called the realm of universal vision.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117a21_8']	是故當知，普別二機感普別二法各不同也。	是故當知，普別二機感普別二法各不同也。	Therefore, you should know that the universal and distinct capacities give rise to the universal and distinct dharmas, each being different.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117a23_3']	二兼為者，謂遺法中見聞信向此無盡法，成金剛種，當必得此圓融普法。	二兼為者，謂遺法中見聞信向此無盡法，成金剛種，當必得此圓融普法。	As for the second, those who are indirectly benefited, it refers to those in the Dharma left behind who see, hear, believe in, and aspire to this inexhaustible Dharma, forming the adamantine seeds, and will definitely attain this perfect and universal Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117a26_3']	如下文吞服金剛喻，又小火廣燒喻等，又如兜率天子從地獄出，得十地無生忍，展轉利益不窮盡等，皆由宿聞此法為本因故。	如下文吞服金剛喻，又小火廣燒喻等，又如兜率天子從地獄出，得十地無生忍，展轉利益不窮盡等，皆由宿聞此法為本因故。	As in the following text, the analogy of swallowing the vajra, and the analogy of a small fire burning widely, and so on, and also like the celestial son of Tuṣita who, upon leaving the hells, attained the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas on the tenth ground, and the benefits that spread and never come to an end, are all due to the fundamental cause of having heard this Dharma in the past.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b03_16']	既云無量億那由他劫不信此經，即知過此劫數必當信受，以離此普法更無餘路得成佛故、經不說彼過此劫數猶不信故。	既云無量億那由他劫不信此經，即知過此劫數必當信受，以離此普法更無餘路得成佛故、經不說彼過此劫數猶不信故。	Since it is said that for immeasurable billions of nayutas of eons they do not believe this sutra, one should know that after those eons they will certainly believe and accept it, because apart from this universal Dharma there is no other path to attain Buddhahood, and because the sutra does not say that after those eons they still do not believe.

The slowest will definitely believe and enter within this number of eons;

Therefore, this sutra is said to be only for bodhisattvas and does not include the two vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b13_6']	若不爾者，餘大乘經有聲聞眾為所被機，亦引二乘令其入大。	若不爾者，餘大乘經有聲聞眾為所被機，亦引二乘令其入大。	If it were not so, other Mahayana sutras have the assembly of shravakas as the intended recipients, and also lead the two vehicles to enter the great vehicle.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b14_15']	唯獨此經，眾無聲聞之機、文無迴小之說，何成了義深廣之典？	唯獨此經，眾無聲聞之機、文無迴小之說，何成了義深廣之典？	Only this sutra has no assembly with the capacity of shravakas, and no text that turns the small. How then is it a sutra of definitive meaning and profound vastness?
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b16_18']	設第八會有聲聞者，為寄對顯法，表如聾盲，非是所被，其六千比丘非是羅漢，故不相違。	設第八會有聲聞者，為寄對顯法，表如聾盲，非是所被，其六千比丘非是羅漢，故不相違。	If there are śrāvakas in the eighth assembly, it is to use them as a foil to illustrate the Dharma, showing that they are like the deaf and blind and are not the intended audience. The six thousand bhikṣus are not arhats, so there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b17_17']	是故當知，一切二乘總無頓入普賢法界。	是故當知，一切二乘總無頓入普賢法界。	Therefore, one should know that all the two vehicles do not enter the universal Dharma realm all at once.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b20_7']	依究竟說，無有二乘而不迴入共教菩薩，無彼菩薩而不入此普賢之法，是故展轉無不皆是此法之器。	依究竟說，無有二乘而不迴入共教菩薩，無彼菩薩而不入此普賢之法，是故展轉無不皆是此法之器。	Based on the ultimate teaching, there are no two vehicles that do not turn back and enter together with the bodhisattvas of the common teaching, and there are no such bodhisattvas who do not enter this universal Dharma. Therefore, each and every one is a vessel for this Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b22_2']	五遠為者，謂諸凡愚外道闡提悉有佛性，以障重故，久遠亦當得入此法。	五遠為者，謂諸凡愚外道闡提悉有佛性，以障重故，久遠亦當得入此法。	Fifth, as for those who are far away, it means that all ordinary fools, non-Buddhists, and icchantikas all have buddha-nature. Because their hindrances are heavy, they will also enter this Dharma after a long time.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b24_5']	如《佛性論》及《寶性論》皆說，以一闡提謗大乘因，依無量時說無佛性，非謂究竟無清淨性。	如《佛性論》及《寶性論》皆說，以一闡提謗大乘因，依無量時說無佛性，非謂究竟無清淨性。	As the Treatise on Buddha-Nature and the Treatise on the Jewel Nature both explain, based on the fact that icchantikas slander the cause of the Great Vehicle, it is said that they do not have buddha-nature for an immeasurable period of time, but it is not that they ultimately lack pure nature.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b26_5']	又如此經性起大樹，於二乘闡提二處不生牙亦不捨生性等，又如日照生盲喻等。	又如此經性起大樹，於二乘闡提二處不生牙亦不捨生性等，又如日照生盲喻等。	Moreover, this sutra states that the great tree of nature origination does not produce sprouts in the two realms of the two vehicles and icchantikas, yet it does not abandon the nature of production, and so forth. It is also like the analogy of the sun shining on the blind.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b27_15']	是故當知，一切眾生究竟無不皆入此法，以此普法眾生具有故。	是故當知，一切眾生究竟無不皆入此法，以此普法眾生具有故。	Therefore, one should know that ultimately all sentient beings without exception enter this Dharma, because all sentient beings possess this universal Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117b28_18']	下文云「菩薩知一切眾生身中有如來菩提」等。	下文云「菩薩知一切眾生身中有如來菩提」等。	The text below states: Bodhisattvas know that within the bodies of all sentient beings there is the enlightenment of the Tathāgata.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117c02_2']	此由教門有了不了，故有諸說。	此由教門有了不了，故有諸說。	This is due to the teachings having explicit and implicit meanings, and therefore there are various explanations.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117c04_15']	若大乘初教，即五性差別，一分有性、一分無性，如《瑜伽》等。	若大乘初教，即五性差別，一分有性、一分無性，如《瑜伽》等。	If it is the initial teaching of the Mahāyāna, then there are distinctions in the five natures, with a portion having the nature and a portion lacking the nature, as stated in the Yogācāra treatises and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117c05_21']	若依終教，一切眾生悉有佛性，如《涅槃》等經《佛性》等論。	若依終教，一切眾生悉有佛性，如《涅槃》等經《佛性》等論。	If based on the final teaching, all sentient beings have Buddha-nature, as the Nirvana Sutra and the Treatise on Buddha-Nature explain.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117c07_20']	若依頓教，眾生佛性一味一相，不可言有、不可說無，離言絕慮，如《諸法無行經》等說。	若依頓教，眾生佛性一味一相，不可言有、不可說無，離言絕慮，如《諸法無行經》等說。	If based on the sudden teaching, the Buddha-nature of sentient beings is of one flavor and one characteristic. It cannot be said to exist or to be nonexistent. It transcends words and thoughts, as the Sutra of the Non-practice of All Dharmas explains.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0117c09_19']	若依圓教，眾生佛性具因具果、有性有相，圓明備德，如〈性起品〉如來菩提處說。	若依圓教，眾生佛性具因具果、有性有相，圓明備德，如〈性起品〉如來菩提處說。	If based on the perfect teaching, the Buddha-nature of sentient beings is endowed with causes and effects, with nature and characteristics, and is perfectly bright and endowed with virtues, as explained in the chapter on the arising of nature and the place of the Tathagata's enlightenment.

Because of the mutual dependence of conditioned arising, 2. Because the nature of dharmas is interfused, 3. Because each is only manifested by the mind, 4. Because like an illusion it is not real, 5. Because large and small are indeterminate, 6. Because they are born from limitless causes, 7. Because the virtues of fruition are perfect and ultimate, 8. Because of the mastery of excellent spiritual powers, 9. Because of the great function of samādhi, 10. Because of inconceivable liberation.
['ZH_T35_1733_001:0124a17_3']	初緣起相由故者，謂大法界中緣起法海義門無量，約就圓宗略舉十門以釋前義，謂諸緣起法要具此十義方緣起故，闕即不成。	初緣起相由故者，謂大法界中緣起法海義門無量，約就圓宗略舉十門以釋前義，謂諸緣起法要具此十義方緣起故，闕即不成。	First, the principle of mutual dependence: In the great Dharma realm, the ocean of interdependent phenomena has immeasurable meanings. Based on the perfect teaching, ten aspects are briefly presented to explain the previous meaning. The interdependent phenomena must possess these ten meanings to be interdependent, and if any is lacking, they cannot be established.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0124a19_17']	若不爾者，諸緣雜亂失本緣法，緣起不成。	若不爾者，諸緣雜亂失本緣法，緣起不成。	If it is not so, the conditions will be chaotic, losing the original nature of the conditions, and interdependent origination cannot be established.

['ZH_T35_1733_001:0124a27_13']	是故唯一多一自在無礙。	是故唯一多一自在無礙。	Therefore, the single and the many are freely unobstructed.
