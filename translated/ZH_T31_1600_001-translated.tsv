['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b18_19']	虛妄分別有者，謂有所取、能取分別。	虛妄分別有者，謂有所取、能取分別。	001	The existence of false imagination refers to the discrimination of the grasped and the grasper.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b20_4']	於此二都無者，謂即於此虛妄分別，永無所取、能取二性。	於此二都無者，謂即於此虛妄分別，永無所取、能取二性。	001	The complete non-existence of these two refers to the eternal non-existence of the two natures of the grasped and the grasper in this false imagination.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b21_9']	此中唯有空者，謂虛妄分別中但有離所取及能取空性。	此中唯有空者，謂虛妄分別中但有離所取及能取空性。	001	Herein, there is only emptiness refers to the mere existence of the emptiness of the separation from the grasped and the grasper within false imagination.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b22_14']	於彼亦有此者，謂即於彼二空性中亦但有此虛妄分別。	於彼亦有此者，謂即於彼二空性中亦但有此虛妄分別。	001	Therein, it also exists refers to the mere existence of this false imagination within those two natures of emptiness.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b23_8']	若於此非有，由彼觀為空；	若於此非有，由彼觀為空；	001	If it does not exist here, it is seen as empty by that [emptiness].

['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b24_13']	若如是者，則能無倒顯示空相。	若如是者，則能無倒顯示空相。	001	If it is like this, then one is able to non-erroneously reveal the characteristics of emptiness.

['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b25_0']	故說一切法，　　非空非不空，	故說一切法，　　非空非不空，	001	Therefore, it is said that all dharmas are neither empty nor non-empty,
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b26_13']	有無及有故，　　是則契中道。	有無及有故，　　是則契中道。	001	Because of existence, non-existence, and existence, this then accords with the middle way.

['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b27_16']	一切法者，謂諸有為及無為法。	一切法者，謂諸有為及無為法。	001	All dharmas refers to conditioned and unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464b28_12']	虛妄分別名有為，二取空性名無為。	虛妄分別名有為，二取空性名無為。	001	Unreal ideation is called conditioned, and the emptiness of the two grasps is called unconditioned.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c01_16']	依前理故，說此一切法非空非不空，由有空性虛妄分別故說非空，由無所取能取性故說非不空。	依前理故，說此一切法非空非不空，由有空性虛妄分別故說非空，由無所取能取性故說非不空。	001	In accordance with the former principle, it is said that all these dharmas are neither empty nor not empty, because there is the nature of emptiness and unreal ideation, it is said that they are not empty; because there is no grasped and grasper, it is said that they are not not empty.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c02_11']	有故者，謂有空性虛妄分別故。	有故者，謂有空性虛妄分別故。	001	Because of existence means because there is the nature of emptiness and unreal ideation.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c03_5']	無故者，謂無所取能取二性故。	無故者，謂無所取能取二性故。	001	Because of non-existence means because there is no nature of the grasped and grasper.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c04_13']	及有故者，謂虛妄分別中有空性故，及空性中有虛妄分別故。	及有故者，謂虛妄分別中有空性故，及空性中有虛妄分別故。	001	And because of existence means because within unreal ideation there is the nature of emptiness, and because within the nature of emptiness there is unreal ideation.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c07_5']	是則契中道者，謂一切法非一向空亦非一向不空，如是理趣妙契中道，亦善符順般若等經說一切法非空非有。	是則契中道者，謂一切法非一向空亦非一向不空，如是理趣妙契中道，亦善符順般若等經說一切法非空非有。	001	This then accords with the middle way means that all dharmas are neither unilaterally empty nor unilaterally not empty. This principle wonderfully accords with the middle way, and also well conforms to the sutras such as the Prajnaparamita, which say that all dharmas are neither empty nor existent.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c08_6']	如是已顯虛妄分別有相無相，此自相今當說。	如是已顯虛妄分別有相無相，此自相今當說。	001	Thus the characteristics of existence and non-existence of unreal ideation have already been revealed. Its own characteristics will now be explained.

['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c11_16']	變似義者，謂似色等諸境性現。	變似義者，謂似色等諸境性現。	001	As for transforming into appearances of objects, it means manifesting as the nature of various objects such as form, etc.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c12_12']	變似有情者，謂似自他身五根性現。	變似有情者，謂似自他身五根性現。	001	Transforming into appearances of sentient beings means manifesting as the nature of the five sense faculties of oneself and others.

['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c14_6']	變似了者，謂餘六識，了相麁故。	變似了者，謂餘六識，了相麁故。	001	Transforming into appearances of cognition means the other six consciousnesses, because their characteristics are coarse.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c15_17']	此境實非有者，謂似義似根無行相故，似我似了非真現故，皆非實有。	此境實非有者，謂似義似根無行相故，似我似了非真現故，皆非實有。	001	As for these objects not really existing, it means that because they lack the characteristics of objects, faculties, and activity, and because appearances of self and cognition are not true manifestations, they all do not really exist.
['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c17_4']	境無故識無者，謂所取義等四境無故，能取諸識亦非實有。	境無故識無者，謂所取義等四境無故，能取諸識亦非實有。	001	As for consciousness not existing because the objects do not exist, it means that because the four objects such as the perceived objects, etc. do not exist, the consciousnesses that perceive them also do not really exist.

['ZH_T31_1600_001:0464c22_17']	以許此滅得解脫故。	以許此滅得解脫故。	001	Because it is accepted that its cessation attains liberation.
