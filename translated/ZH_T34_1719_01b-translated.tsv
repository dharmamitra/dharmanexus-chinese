['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a06_0']	指本因所稟；次、「但佛」下，指本果所說；三、中間	指本因所稟；次、「但佛」下，指本果所說；三、中間	01b	pointing to the original cause that is received; next, But the Buddha and below, pointing to the original fruit that is spoken; third,

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a07_16']	五、未來所說。	五、未來所說。	01b	fifth, what will be spoken in the future.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a09_16']	自從本因所稟莫非真實三段，雖俱真實本不可多，故下三文咸同一本因果真實三段教相。	自從本因所稟莫非真實三段，雖俱真實本不可多，故下三文咸同一本因果真實三段教相。	01b	From the original cause that is received, there is nothing that is not the true three sections. Although all are true, the original cannot be many, so the following three texts are all the same as the original cause and effect, the true three sections of the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a10_11']	此中正簡久本真實，是故云也。	此中正簡久本真實，是故云也。	01b	Here, the long-standing original truth is specifically selected, so it is said.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a13_6']	然以本因所稟亦是彼佛迹說恐無窮，故但在今佛因果為本，據理非不稟餘佛化，因緣約教既指今佛，故明本迹。	然以本因所稟亦是彼佛迹說恐無窮，故但在今佛因果為本，據理非不稟餘佛化，因緣約教既指今佛，故明本迹。	01b	However, the original cause that is received is also the traces spoken by that Buddha, fearing it would be endless, so it is only in the present Buddha's cause and effect as the original. According to principle, it is not that it does not receive the transformation of other Buddhas. The causes and conditions and teachings are already pointing to the present Buddha, so the original and traces are clarified.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a14_12']	且廢於他，故指今經壽量為釋迦本，不得更指前佛所說。	且廢於他，故指今經壽量為釋迦本，不得更指前佛所說。	01b	Therefore, the present sutra's lifespan is pointed to as Śākyamuni's original, and one cannot point to what was spoken by previous Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a16_5']	前佛復有前佛，故云無窮，唯指一佛則無斯過，降茲一本餘皆是迹。	前佛復有前佛，故云無窮，唯指一佛則無斯過，降茲一本餘皆是迹。	01b	Previous Buddhas also have previous Buddhas, so it is said to be endless. Only pointing to one Buddha avoids this fault. Below this one original, the rest are traces.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a18_7']	恐墮無窮唯論釋迦，今欲論諸佛展轉稟教，終有一佛在初無教，無教為本有何無窮？	恐墮無窮唯論釋迦，今欲論諸佛展轉稟教，終有一佛在初無教，無教為本有何無窮？	01b	Fearing falling into endlessness, only discussing Śākyamuni, now wanting to discuss the Buddhas passing on the teachings, there must be a Buddha at the beginning without teachings. Without teachings as the basis, what is endless?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a18_17']	若許有窮，墮無因過。	若許有窮，墮無因過。	01b	If allowing for an end, falling into the fault of no cause.

Even if there is an original different from the present original, what benefit is there to practice and understanding?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a20_13']	問：	問：	01b	Question:
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a21_11']	若許有最初無教，何須稟今佛之教？	若許有最初無教，何須稟今佛之教？	01b	If allowing for an original without teachings, why is it necessary to receive the teachings of the present Buddha?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a21_13']	答：	答：	01b	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a22_12']	無教之時則內熏自悟，有教之日何得守迷？	無教之時則內熏自悟，有教之日何得守迷？	01b	When without teachings, then internally perfuming to awaken by oneself. On the day of having teachings, how can one remain in delusion?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a24_8']	如百迷盲俱不知路，一迷先達以教餘迷，餘迷守愚不受先教，誰之過歟？	如百迷盲俱不知路，一迷先達以教餘迷，餘迷守愚不受先教，誰之過歟？	01b	It is like a hundred blind people together not knowing the road. One blind person who has previously reached the destination teaches the other blind people, but the other blind people stubbornly refuse to accept the previous teachings. Whose fault is it?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a25_15']	且驗釋迦一化得益難思，況復爾前益難稱紀，寧不稟教？	且驗釋迦一化得益難思，況復爾前益難稱紀，寧不稟教？	01b	Moreover, it is verified that Śākyamuni's teachings in one lifetime bring about inconceivable benefits, let alone the benefits before that which are difficult to record. How could it not be due to receiving the teachings?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a27_3']	然終成無益之論，不可以此為窮，以無益於稟教者故。	然終成無益之論，不可以此為窮，以無益於稟教者故。	01b	However, it ultimately becomes a discussion of no benefit, which cannot be used to reach the end, because it brings no benefit to those who receive the teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158a28_12']	又十方世界亦有嗅香覺觸瞪視而得悟者，豈以聲教求其初耶？	又十方世界亦有嗅香覺觸瞪視而得悟者，豈以聲教求其初耶？	01b	Moreover, there are also those in the worlds of the ten directions who attain enlightenment by smelling fragrances, being aware of touch, and staring, so how can one seek their initial [enlightenment] through sound and teachings?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b02_3']	「師子奮迅未來永永」者，奮迅具二義，左右如現前却如未，故下疏文云「釋此句者應具二解，即現未也」。	「師子奮迅未來永永」者，奮迅具二義，左右如現前却如未，故下疏文云「釋此句者應具二解，即現未也」。	01b	The lion's exertion is forever in the future has two meanings: exertion and relaxation are like the present, but retreating is like the future, so the commentary below says, To explain this sentence, one should have two understandings, namely the present and the future.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b03_2']	今存後解故云未來，前存前解故云現在。	今存後解故云未來，前存前解故云現在。	01b	Now, the latter understanding is retained, so it is said to be in the future. The former understanding is retained, so it is said to be in the present.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b04_3']	「譬大樹」者，總譬前三節為拂遊中本迹故也。	「譬大樹」者，總譬前三節為拂遊中本迹故也。	01b	Like a great tree is a general metaphor for the previous three sections, to remove doubts about the original and traces in the wandering.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b04_19']	言「云云」者，以易解故不復合喻。	言「云云」者，以易解故不復合喻。	01b	The words and so on are because it is easy to understand, so I will not further combine the metaphors.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b05_14']	「次示觀心相者」，先總、次別。	「次示觀心相者」，先總、次別。	01b	Next, showing the characteristics of contemplating the mind first generally, then specifically.

Practice must first be precepts, then concentration, and finally wisdom. Using must first use wisdom to choose, then establish precepts, because concentration is the basis of precepts, so precepts are placed last.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b10_11']	又觀心者，如《玄》文中，或約行相、或約法門、或從觀境，故銷文例之亦對三分，義當觀心。	又觀心者，如《玄》文中，或約行相、或約法門、或從觀境，故銷文例之亦對三分，義當觀心。	01b	Moreover, contemplating the mind is like in the 玄 text, sometimes about the characteristics of practice, sometimes about the Dharma gate, or following the observed realm. Therefore, in the example of dissolving the text, it also corresponds to the three parts, the meaning is equivalent to contemplating the mind.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b11_2']	次別意者，三分各三。	次別意者，三分各三。	01b	Next, the specific meaning is that each of the three parts has three.

If following the three parts, entering is the introduction, abiding is the main part, and exiting is the dissemination. The three of wisdom are also the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b18_16']	從文從義次第不同，三分應云空序、中正、假為流通。	從文從義次第不同，三分應云空序、中正、假為流通。	01b	The sequence is different according to the text and meaning. The three parts should be said to be emptiness as the introduction, the middle as the main part, and the provisional as the dissemination.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b19_15']	言「而退」者，經末但云「而去」，去秖是退。	言「而退」者，經末但云「而去」，去秖是退。	01b	As for and withdrew, the end of the sūtra only says departed, and departing is just withdrawing.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b20_14']	「但準望」等者，盡令用四其辭則難，但令不失旨。	「但準望」等者，盡令用四其辭則難，但令不失旨。	01b	As for but according to expectation, if all four are used, the words will be difficult, but as long as the meaning is not lost.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b23_1']	「如共轍鹹會」，「鹹」字恐誤，秖應單作，或恐如流入海一同鹹味，文體語倒，故知不必皆用四意。	「如共轍鹹會」，「鹹」字恐誤，秖應單作，或恐如流入海一同鹹味，文體語倒，故知不必皆用四意。	01b	Like a salty gathering with a common track, the character salty is probably an error, it should only be written alone, or it is probably like the flow entering the ocean with the same salty taste, the literary style is inverted, therefore it is known that it is not necessary to all use the four meanings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158b24_3']	又觀心一文，除〈安樂行〉中修攝其心等，餘皆義立。	又觀心一文，除〈安樂行〉中修攝其心等，餘皆義立。	01b	Moreover, the text on contemplating the mind, except for the cultivation and concentration of the mind and so forth in the chapter on peaceful practices, the rest are all established by meaning.

In the main theme, only the chapter on peaceful practices is logically determined to be necessary, the rest are all established by meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c04_6']	迹門正說既云開會，若迷觀境開權顯實，及本門中增念佛觀增道損生，及流通中隨喜不輕三昧所依、諸行所託，一切不成以觀心名通，於觀等中間三即結緣，當機通用觀故，影響發起化功。	迹門正說既云開會，若迷觀境開權顯實，及本門中增念佛觀增道損生，及流通中隨喜不輕三昧所依、諸行所託，一切不成以觀心名通，於觀等中間三即結緣，當機通用觀故，影響發起化功。	01b	Since the direct explanation of the traces gate says it opens and unifies, if one is confused about the observed realm opening up the provisional to reveal the real, and the inherent gate's increase in mindfulness of the Buddha, increase in the path, and decrease in birth, as well as the distribution of the three samādhis of rejoicing and disrespect, and the reliance and support of various practices, all will not be accomplished because the name of observing the mind is common, and the three in the middle of observing, etc., are the common use of observing the mind for the sake of the distant and immediate causes, and the power of transformation of the reflected and initiated.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c05_10']	若成成分證觀，所以觀心一文人謂最寬，於理甚要。	若成成分證觀，所以觀心一文人謂最寬，於理甚要。	01b	If it is accomplished, it is a part of the realization of observation. Therefore, the text of observing the mind is considered the most extensive, and is very essential in principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c09_6']	況今大師且為成於初心學者，始從如是以至而去，覩異文識一觀，亦識昔經文同觀異及文觀俱異，亦識當教文觀俱同兼等開等準例可識，是故必須觀心以釋。	況今大師且為成於初心學者，始從如是以至而去，覩異文識一觀，亦識昔經文同觀異及文觀俱異，亦識當教文觀俱同兼等開等準例可識，是故必須觀心以釋。	01b	Moreover, the present great master is just for the sake of accomplishing the beginner, starting from thus up to depart, seeing different texts and recognizing the same observation, also recognizing the same text and different observation in the past sutras, and also recognizing the same text and observation in the future teaching, as well as the equal opening, etc., which can be recognized by analogy. Therefore, it is necessary to use observing the mind to explain.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c11_4']	初文又二：	初文又二：	01b	The first text has two parts:

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c13_16']	亦可云通序通諸經，別序別一教。	亦可云通序通諸經，別序別一教。	01b	It can also be said that the general preface is common to all sutras, while the specific preface is specific to one teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c14_15']	今經部教唯在一教，故且以教對經言之。	今經部教唯在一教，故且以教對經言之。	01b	The current sutra and teaching are only in one teaching, so for now it is discussed in terms of teaching and sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c18_5']	又通序名通而體別，別序事別而義通，義通故通有別序，體別故別在今經，故知今經通別俱別別在佛乘，以如是等不關諸經，方可得名正家之序。	又通序名通而體別，別序事別而義通，義通故通有別序，體別故別在今經，故知今經通別俱別別在佛乘，以如是等不關諸經，方可得名正家之序。	01b	Moreover, the general preface is called general but its substance is specific. The specific preface has specific events but its meaning is general. Because the meaning is general, there is a specific preface. Because the substance is specific, it is specific to the current sutra. Therefore, it should be known that the current sutra's general and specific are both specific, specific to the Buddha vehicle. Because such things are not related to other sutras, it can be called the preface of the correct teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c19_3']	正名序家之正，故一家相承三段可識。	正名序家之正，故一家相承三段可識。	01b	The correct is called the preface of the specific, therefore the three parts can be recognized by the one school that has been passed down.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0158c22_3']	故釋如是竟一部炳然，不然豈有送客之序而敘遊山，禪祖碑文而譚律頌，故須摩頂至足皆是一身，豈以通途之言能消通別二序？	故釋如是竟一部炳然，不然豈有送客之序而敘遊山，禪祖碑文而譚律頌，故須摩頂至足皆是一身，豈以通途之言能消通別二序？	01b	Therefore, when explaining this way, the entire text is clearly illuminated. Otherwise, how could there be a preface for sending off guests that narrates traveling in the mountains, or a stele inscription for Chan patriarchs that discusses vinaya verses? Therefore, one must regard from the crown of the head to the feet as all being one body. How can the words of the common path explain the two prefaces of the common and the specific?

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0159c22_1']	初、約傳詮相對以釋；	初、約傳詮相對以釋；	01b	First, using the contrast between transmission and interpretation to explain;

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0159c24_6']	於所聞時具能所故，亦是以理結略前釋，是故四釋皆以如為名。	於所聞時具能所故，亦是以理結略前釋，是故四釋皆以如為名。	01b	When hearing, it is complete with both the ability and the object, and it is also using principle to conclude the brief explanation above. Therefore, the four explanations all use suchness as their names.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0159c25_8']	又前以文契理，名之曰如，乃指所詮稱文為是；	又前以文契理，名之曰如，乃指所詮稱文為是；	01b	Moreover, previously using the written to accord with principle was called suchness, and it pointed to the interpreted as being the written;
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0159c27_12']	此以智如境為如，如通二真，故前兩教俗對偏真，後之兩教俗對中真，兩文各二隨義消之。	此以智如境為如，如通二真，故前兩教俗對偏真，後之兩教俗對中真，兩文各二隨義消之。	01b	This uses the suchness of wisdom as the suchness of the realm. Suchness is common to both truths. Therefore, the two teachings before use the conventional to contrast with biased truth, and the two teachings after use the conventional to contrast with the truth of the middle. The two texts each have two, which should be explained according to the meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0159c29_15']	故前約傳詮一一文中，皆約諦與文字，故能詮既同，驗知所詮理當，故所傳所詮皆所聞體。	故前約傳詮一一文中，皆約諦與文字，故能詮既同，驗知所詮理當，故所傳所詮皆所聞體。	01b	Therefore, previously in each of the texts on transmission and interpretation, they all use the truths and written words. Therefore, since the expository is the same, it can be verified that the interpreted principle is appropriate. Therefore, the transmitted and the interpreted are both the essence of what is heard.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a02_10']	故初二教皆以文字為俗、所詮為真，但有即不即異，乃辨二教傳詮不同；	故初二教皆以文字為俗、所詮為真，但有即不即異，乃辨二教傳詮不同；	01b	Therefore, the first two teachings both take the written words as conventional and what is explained as true, but there is a difference between being identical and not being identical, which distinguishes the different transmissions of the two teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a03_13']	後二教皆以能詮對所詮三諦以說，亦即不即異。	後二教皆以能詮對所詮三諦以說，亦即不即異。	01b	The last two teachings both explain the ability to expound in contrast to the three truths that are expounded, also with a difference between being identical and not being identical.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a07_15']	言「云云」者，應更以是對向四文，及以漸中具教多少，準前可知。	言「云云」者，應更以是對向四文，及以漸中具教多少，準前可知。	01b	As for and so on, it should further be used to contrast with the four texts above, and the relative quantity of teachings in the gradual should be known by analogy with the previous.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a09_8']	次、「頓」等三者，言頓與圓同，且從少分，以彼兼別今且從勝，故云圓同。	次、「頓」等三者，言頓與圓同，且從少分，以彼兼別今且從勝，故云圓同。	01b	Next, the three such as sudden and so on, the sudden is the same as the perfect, but it is just from a lesser perspective, as it is mixed with the separate. Now it is just from the superior, and thus it is said to be the same as the perfect.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a12_7']	應更云頓中別教與漸中別同，不云漸教有同異者，漸既離四，舉圓即攝諸部中圓，三教即是諸部中異，故但更對餘之三教。	應更云頓中別教與漸中別同，不云漸教有同異者，漸既離四，舉圓即攝諸部中圓，三教即是諸部中異，故但更對餘之三教。	01b	It should further be said that the sudden teaching is the same as the gradual teaching, but it does not say that the gradual teaching has similarities and differences. Since the gradual teaching is apart from the four, mentioning the perfect immediately includes the perfections in various teachings. The three teachings are precisely the differences in various teachings, so it only further corresponds to the remaining three teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a13_15']	不定中云「更互」者，並約漸頓四教說之，深淺相望故云前後。	不定中云「更互」者，並約漸頓四教說之，深淺相望故云前後。	01b	In the indeterminate, it says mutually. This is all about the gradual and sudden four teachings. The depths are compared to each other, so it says before and after.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a15_8']	「祕密不傳」者，降佛已還非所述故，尚非阿難能受，豈弘教者所量？	「祕密不傳」者，降佛已還非所述故，尚非阿難能受，豈弘教者所量？	01b	Secret and not transmitted means that below the Buddha, it is not what is spoken of. It is still not what Ānanda can receive, so how can it be measured by those who propagate the teachings?
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a16_6']	又阿難非不傳祕，赴機之密非所傳耳。	又阿難非不傳祕，赴機之密非所傳耳。	01b	Moreover, it is not that Ānanda does not transmit the secret, but the secret that responds to capacities is not what is transmitted.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a17_7']	故祕密所用全是顯教，是故傳祕秖名傳顯。	故祕密所用全是顯教，是故傳祕秖名傳顯。	01b	Therefore, what is used in the secret is entirely the exoteric teachings. Therefore, transmitting the secret is just called transmitting the exoteric.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a22_8']	三、「敷八教」下，結責者，《華嚴》云「張佛教網亘法界海，漉天人魚，置涅槃岸」，故知佛教不出於八，所詮無外故云法界，教網既亘於法界，涅槃必遍於偏圓，岸唯果地一如，教必權實本迹，天人機具眾教，漉至究竟涅槃。	三、「敷八教」下，結責者，《華嚴》云「張佛教網亘法界海，漉天人魚，置涅槃岸」，故知佛教不出於八，所詮無外故云法界，教網既亘於法界，涅槃必遍於偏圓，岸唯果地一如，教必權實本迹，天人機具眾教，漉至究竟涅槃。	01b	Third, below expounding the eight teachings, the conclusion is made. The Huayan Sutra says, Stretching the Buddhist teaching net across the ocean of the Dharma realm, catching heavenly and human fish and placing them on the shore of nirvana. Therefore, it is known that Buddhism does not go beyond the eight, and what is expounded is no external, hence it is called the Dharma realm. Since the teaching net is stretched across the Dharma realm, nirvana must pervade both the biased and the perfect. The shore is only the one suchness of the fruition ground, and the teaching must be provisional, actual, fundamental, and trace. The capacities of heavenly and human beings are equipped with the various teachings, and are caught to reach the ultimate nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a23_17']	故諸師偏釋不可獨張，比竊讀者尚云天台唯藏等四，一何昧哉！	故諸師偏釋不可獨張，比竊讀者尚云天台唯藏等四，一何昧哉！	01b	Therefore, the biased explanations of the various masters cannot be unilaterally stretched. Even those who have secretly read [the Tiantai teachings] still say that Tiantai only has the four such as the Tripitaka. How confused they are!
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a24_3']	一何昧哉！	一何昧哉！	01b	How confused they are!
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a26_10']	是故須知消經方軌，頓等是此宗判教之大綱，藏等是一家釋義之綱目，若消諸教但用藏等，其文稍通。	是故須知消經方軌，頓等是此宗判教之大綱，藏等是一家釋義之綱目，若消諸教但用藏等，其文稍通。	01b	Therefore, one must know the method of interpreting the sutras. The sudden and other teachings are the great framework for classifying the teachings of this school. The Tripitaka and other teachings are the main points for explaining the meaning of this school. If one interprets the various teachings only using the Tripitaka and other teachings, the text becomes somewhat通.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a27_19']	若釋《法華》無頓等八，舉止失措，故又舉喻責云「接四箭」等。	若釋《法華》無頓等八，舉止失措，故又舉喻責云「接四箭」等。	01b	If one explains the Lotus Sūtra without the eight such as sudden, every move is out of place. Therefore, a metaphor is used to criticize it, saying catching four arrows and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160a28_11']	故《大經》「迦葉菩薩問云：	故《大經》「迦葉菩薩問云：	01b	Therefore, in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, Kāśyapa Bodhisattva asked:

The flying ghosts, the Four Heavenly Kings, the sun and moon gods, the swift gods, and so on, are successively faster, but impermanence surpasses them all.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b06_4']	若深得是意入文自融。	若深得是意入文自融。	01b	If one deeply understands this meaning, one will naturally merge with the text.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b08_1']	言「云云」者，應舉八教以合譬意，況若不識開權拂近，徒知八教經旨未分？	言「云云」者，應舉八教以合譬意，況若不識開權拂近，徒知八教經旨未分？	01b	As for and so on, one should bring up the eight teachings to match the meaning of the parable. If one does not understand revealing the provisional and brushing aside the near, one only knows the eight teachings but has not yet distinguished the purport of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b08_19']	所以今文多不云開者，以《玄》文具故。	所以今文多不云開者，以《玄》文具故。	01b	The reason why the present text often does not mention revealing is because the Profound Meaning has already covered it.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b10_3']	又開顯圓與兼帶圓，二理無殊，故云頓與圓同等。	又開顯圓與兼帶圓，二理無殊，故云頓與圓同等。	01b	Moreover, revealing and manifesting the perfect, and the perfect with the provisional, the principle of the two is no different, therefore it is said that the sudden and the perfect are the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b11_8']	故不定、祕密義各含四，顯之與密、定與不定，相對論故。	故不定、祕密義各含四，顯之與密、定與不定，相對論故。	01b	Therefore, the meaning of the indeterminate and the secret each contains four. Revealing and the secret, definite and indefinite, are discussed in contrast to each other.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b16_6']	次「又阿難」下，約於傳詮，師弟相望義立本迹。	次「又阿難」下，約於傳詮，師弟相望義立本迹。	01b	Next, below Moreover, Ananda, it discusses the transmission of the teachings, establishing the principle of the fundamental and the provisional based on the relationship between teacher and disciple.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b18_9']	初云「橫豎」者，十方為橫、三世名豎。	初云「橫豎」者，十方為橫、三世名豎。	01b	The first says horizontal and vertical. The ten directions are horizontal, and the three times are vertical.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b20_3']	十方諸佛各自有豎，非今文意，故「且約」下的出今佛，過去一本、餘皆屬迹。	十方諸佛各自有豎，非今文意，故「且約」下的出今佛，過去一本、餘皆屬迹。	01b	The Buddhas of the ten directions each have their own vertical [teachings], but this is not the meaning of the present text. Therefore, below for now, it brings up the present Buddha, with one original basis in the past, and the rest belonging to the provisional.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b21_2']	師弟中亦指久本，餘屬迹中本迹而已。	師弟中亦指久本，餘屬迹中本迹而已。	01b	In the section on teacher and disciple, it also points to the distant original basis, and the rest belong to the original basis within the provisional.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b27_5']	悉檀是前因緣，教是前約教，迹是前本迹，等取三釋各具諸義，本雖久遠，圓頓雖實，第一義雖理，望觀屬事故咸成境，故對三為觀便成四釋。	悉檀是前因緣，教是前約教，迹是前本迹，等取三釋各具諸義，本雖久遠，圓頓雖實，第一義雖理，望觀屬事故咸成境，故對三為觀便成四釋。	01b	All are the previous dependent origination, teaching is the previous teaching, traces are the previous traces, and the same takes the three explanations each possessing various meanings. Although the origin is distant, although the perfect and sudden is real, although the ultimate truth is principle, it belongs to events in terms of contemplation, and therefore all become objects. Therefore, in contrast to the three, the contemplation easily becomes four explanations.

['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160b29_15']	初文言「即通」者，具足應云緣生即空，即指前三皆緣生故。	初文言「即通」者，具足應云緣生即空，即指前三皆緣生故。	01b	The first text says immediately general means that it should be fully said that arising from conditions is emptiness, which refers to the previous three being arising from conditions.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c02_6']	況前緣生境通三諦，從即空邊且判屬通，應知空觀通於一切。	況前緣生境通三諦，從即空邊且判屬通，應知空觀通於一切。	01b	Moreover, the previous arising from conditions is common to the three truths. From the side of emptiness, it is provisionally judged to belong to the general. It should be known that the contemplation of emptiness is common to everything.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c03_16']	空假成別者，地前從別證道必同，亦通亦別者，凡通聖別故也。	空假成別者，地前從別證道必同，亦通亦別者，凡通聖別故也。	01b	Emptiness and falsehood form the specific. Before the ground, from the specific, the path of realization must be the same. The common and the specific are the common and the specific of ordinary beings and sages.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c04_17']	凡通前教、聖局證中故，空假仍通、中方別故。	凡通前教、聖局證中故，空假仍通、中方別故。	01b	The general refers to the teachings before, while the sage is restricted to realizing the middle, therefore emptiness and provisional are still general, while the middle is distinct.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c06_6']	地前空假通於所非及以所照，登地別在能非能照，真實故也。	地前空假通於所非及以所照，登地別在能非能照，真實故也。	01b	Before ascending the grounds, emptiness and provisional are general in terms of what is not and what is illuminated, but ascending the grounds, they are distinct in terms of what can be not and what can illuminate, because they are true.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c07_4']	此是別家對他通別，若唯別教與前永殊。	此是別家對他通別，若唯別教與前永殊。	01b	This is the distinct teaching's contrast with the general and distinct of others. If it is only the distinct teaching, it is forever different from the previous.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c07_18']	「非通非別」者，無非法界故。	「非通非別」者，無非法界故。	01b	Neither general nor distinct means there is no dharma that is not the dharma realm.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c10_11']	雙非辨別與前復殊，此中既以因緣教迹而為觀境，不可復以藏通觀觀，是故但寄通別四句，寄約教義暫分別之。	雙非辨別與前復殊，此中既以因緣教迹而為觀境，不可復以藏通觀觀，是故但寄通別四句，寄約教義暫分別之。	01b	The double negation to distinguish is again different from the previous. Since here the causes and conditions, teachings, and traces are taken as the objects of contemplation, one cannot again contemplate with the contemplations of the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings. Therefore, it only borrows the four statements of the Distinct Teaching to temporarily distinguish the meaning of the teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01b:0160c12_2']	又為成四句，故借別教離為兩句，故第四句即是今經之妙觀也。	又為成四句，故借別教離為兩句，故第四句即是今經之妙觀也。	01b	Moreover, in order to form the four statements, it borrows the distinct teaching to separate into two statements, therefore the fourth statement is the wonderful contemplation of this sūtra.

The scope of the realm of transformation is vast. This means that searching everywhere in the teachings of Hinayana and Mahayana, there are only these four characteristics of attaining enlightenment, as described in the Profound Text in the two wondrous aspects of cause and effect.

Coming to this sūtra, from the inferior the superior is discerned, and the three are one. Others who are confused about the four buddhas explained by our school discard the old translations of sūtras and treatises.
