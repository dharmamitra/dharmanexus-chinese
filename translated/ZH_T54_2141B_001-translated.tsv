My friend Li Jun, the magistrate of Linchuan, examined it and found that it specifically expounds the principle of light and darkness, and matches the praise in the three testaments of the Christian religion, so it was determined to be a Christian scripture. However, upon examination, Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism are quite similar to Christianity and are not easily distinguished. Moreover, they both spread from Persia to China, so it is provisionally called a scripture of the Persian religion, awaiting examination by religious scholars of the present age. Recorded by Luo Zhenyu of Shangyu in the third month of the third year of Xuan Tong.
