['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897a02_12']	若有眾生能如是知者，名為發心、名為諸佛、名為見道，而能開悟一切眾生，是名達無明者。	若有眾生能如是知者，名為發心、名為諸佛、名為見道，而能開悟一切眾生，是名達無明者。	026	If there are sentient beings who can understand in this way, it is called giving rise to the mind, it is called buddhas, it is called seeing the path, and is able to enlighten all sentient beings, this is called one who penetrates ignorance.

['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b02_19']	明十二緣體，眾生情有而實理無，善達理無緣性，便即生死為不生死。	明十二緣體，眾生情有而實理無，善達理無緣性，便即生死為不生死。	026	It clarifies that the substance of the twelve links of dependent origination is something sentient beings emotionally have but is actually logically nonexistent. If one skillfully understands the logical nonexistence of the nature of dependent origination, then birth and death are not birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b05_5']	此上一段，明由著我因有十二有支，若作無我觀，得離我所，諸虛妄緣便為法界大智無作自性緣生故。	此上一段，明由著我因有十二有支，若作無我觀，得離我所，諸虛妄緣便為法界大智無作自性緣生故。	026	This section above clarifies that the twelve links of dependent origination exist due to attachment to self.

['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b07_1']	第二段中有十行半經，明菩薩念一切眾生分。	第二段中有十行半經，明菩薩念一切眾生分。	026	The second section has ten and a half lines of text, clarifying the part where the Bodhisattva thinks of all sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b07_12']	迷第一義諦，號曰無明。	迷第一義諦，號曰無明。	026	Delusion about the ultimate truth is called ignorance.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b08_2']	所作業果，是行行依止。	所作業果，是行行依止。	026	The results of karmic activity are the basis of action.

['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b11_8']	為迷真相情識取境，與受想行識及以六根同時而取，名之為蘊。	為迷真相情識取境，與受想行識及以六根同時而取，名之為蘊。	026	In order to delude the true appearance, the emotional consciousness grasps the realm, together with feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness, and the six sense faculties, it is grasped simultaneously, and is called the aggregates.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b11_18']	蘊不壞故，名之為業。	蘊不壞故，名之為業。	026	Because the aggregates are indestructible, they are called karma.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b14_2']	識心為主，六根及境三事和合而為所緣，共生四取者，情為名色為境，情識為能緣，受隨之，名為行。	識心為主，六根及境三事和合而為所緣，共生四取者，情為名色為境，情識為能緣，受隨之，名為行。	026	The conscious mind is the main factor. The six sense faculties and objects are combined to become the object of cognition. The four graspings arise together. The emotions are the form and objects of the mind. The emotional consciousness is the subjective cognition. The feelings follow it and are called formations.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b14_17']	尋思煩憂，迷其淨智，名之為蘊。	尋思煩憂，迷其淨智，名之為蘊。	026	Seeking, thinking, and worrying confuse one's pure wisdom and are called the aggregates.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b15_10']	六根、境、識三事和合，名之為觸。	六根、境、識三事和合，名之為觸。	026	The combination of the three things of the six sense faculties, objects, and consciousness is called contact.

['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b18_14']	如是已上一段，明迷第一義而生五蘊，從五蘊上共生十二有支。	如是已上一段，明迷第一義而生五蘊，從五蘊上共生十二有支。	026	Thus far, this section clarifies how, by being deluded about the ultimate truth, the five aggregates arise, and how the twelve links of dependent arising arise together based on the five aggregates.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b20_1']	第三段中有七行半經，明三界所有唯是一心。	第三段中有七行半經，明三界所有唯是一心。	026	The third section has seven and a half lines of text, clarifying that all that exists in the three realms is only one mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b22_9']	明十二有支從一心起，以隨事貪欲迷真心故，妄心生為想，想心乖智妄辨為識，妄心所辨是識，緣境是行。	明十二有支從一心起，以隨事貪欲迷真心故，妄心生為想，想心乖智妄辨為識，妄心所辨是識，緣境是行。	026	It clarifies that the twelve links arise from one mind, because following the matter of craving and delusion of the true mind, the deluded mind arises as thought. Thought deviates from wisdom and falsely discriminates as consciousness. What is discriminated by the deluded mind is consciousness, and the object of consciousness is action.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b22_20']	於行迷惑者，所緣之境。	於行迷惑者，所緣之境。	026	Delusion regarding action refers to the object of consciousness.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b23_9']	謂實有故，名曰無明。	謂實有故，名曰無明。	026	It is called ignorance because it is considered to truly exist.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b23_20']	以心無明故，便生名色。	以心無明故，便生名色。	026	Because the mind is ignorant, it gives rise to name-and-form.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b25_11']	從名色、六根、妄心三事和合生觸，正觸相應分別取著是受，餘如經自具。	從名色、六根、妄心三事和合生觸，正觸相應分別取著是受，餘如經自具。	026	From name-and-form, the six sense faculties, and the deluded mind, the three things come together to give rise to contact. The correct contact corresponds to discrimination and attachment, which is feeling. The rest is complete in the sutra itself.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897b28_7']	此已上心境、六根、觸、受、愛、取、有、生老死一時，無前後體妄作前後，迷如來之理智本來無作者故，橫生諸苦，波浪苦流不息故。	此已上心境、六根、觸、受、愛、取、有、生老死一時，無前後體妄作前後，迷如來之理智本來無作者故，橫生諸苦，波浪苦流不息故。	026	Above this, mind and object, the six sense faculties, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, old age and death, all occur simultaneously, without a prior or posterior substance. Delusion creates prior and posterior. Delusion regarding the principle and wisdom of the Tathagata originally has no creator, so it gives rise to various sufferings horizontally, and the waves of suffering flow without ceasing.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c02_9']	第四一段有十五行半經，明無明及十二有支皆有二種業者，一由無明故，令一切眾生迷於無作智自性法界；	第四一段有十五行半經，明無明及十二有支皆有二種業者，一由無明故，令一切眾生迷於無作智自性法界；	026	The fourth section has fifteen and a half lines of text, clarifying that both ignorance and the twelve links of dependent origination have two kinds of karma. First, due to ignorance, it causes all sentient beings to be confused about the self-nature of the wisdom of non-action and the Dharma realm;
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c03_14']	二由無明緣生，便作思想行緣故，故云與行作生起因。	二由無明緣生，便作思想行緣故，故云與行作生起因。	026	second, because ignorance gives rise to dependent origination, it causes the conditions of thought and activity to be produced, therefore it is said to be the cause of giving rise to activity.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c05_7']	行亦有二種業者，一由迷法界智執成來世報、二由妄行心想識種便生。	行亦有二種業者，一由迷法界智執成來世報、二由妄行心想識種便生。	026	Activity also has two kinds of karma. First, due to confusion about the wisdom of the Dharma realm, it grasps and forms the retribution of the future; second, due to the deluded activity of thought, the seeds of consciousness are produced.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c05_20']	是故經云「與識作生起因」。	是故經云「與識作生起因」。	026	Therefore, the sūtra says, It is the cause of giving rise to consciousness.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c07_10']	識亦有二種業者，一由迷根本智種，妄生識種，令諸業有相續不斷；	識亦有二種業者，一由迷根本智種，妄生識種，令諸業有相續不斷；	026	Consciousness also has two kinds of karma. First, due to confusion about the seeds of fundamental wisdom, deluded consciousness arises and causes the karma of all beings to continue without interruption;
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c09_11']	二由迷根本普光明智所有無名相之微妙功德之名色，生識種所成生死業報之麁名色也。	二由迷根本普光明智所有無名相之微妙功德之名色，生識種所成生死業報之麁名色也。	026	second, due to confusion about the nameless subtle merits of the universal light wisdom of the fundamental source, the coarse name-and-form of the karma of birth and death formed by the seeds of consciousness arises.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c11_2']	名色亦有二種業者，一由識成名色，由名色成識，故云互相助成；	名色亦有二種業者，一由識成名色，由名色成識，故云互相助成；	026	As for name-and-form also having two kinds of karma, first, because of consciousness, there is name-and-form, and because of name-and-form, there is consciousness, thus it is said they mutually assist each other;
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c12_5']	二由名色故，對六根中現相，能令六根中情識取之。	二由名色故，對六根中現相，能令六根中情識取之。	026	second, because of name-and-form, it appears before the six sense organs, able to cause the emotional consciousness in the six sense organs to grasp it.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c14_2']	六根亦有二種業者，一由迷無相體一相之理智，各隨別境別取境界色聲等異；	六根亦有二種業者，一由迷無相體一相之理智，各隨別境別取境界色聲等異；	026	As for the six sense organs also having two kinds of karma, first, because of delusion about the principle of the single characteristic of the essence of signlessness, each according to a different object grasps the different characteristics of form, sound, etc.;
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c15_7']	二為六根現境，識心相對妄情便起故，云與觸作生起因。	二為六根現境，識心相對妄情便起故，云與觸作生起因。	026	second, because the six sense organs manifest objects, the emotional consciousness arises in opposition to them, thus it is said it acts as the cause of production for contact.
['ZH_T36_1739_026:0897c16_15']	觸亦有二種業者，一由觸能迷所緣，便能受現世塵成諸喜怒；	觸亦有二種業者，一由觸能迷所緣，便能受現世塵成諸喜怒；	026	As for contact also having two kinds of karma, first, because of contact able to delude the object, it can receive present-world dust and form various joys and angers;
