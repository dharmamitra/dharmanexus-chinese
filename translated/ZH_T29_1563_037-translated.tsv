['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b08_0']	復有餘佛法，　　共餘聖異生，	復有餘佛法，　　共餘聖異生，	037	There are also other Buddha-dharmas, shared with other noble ones and ordinary beings,
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b09_13']	謂無諍願智，　　無礙解等德。	謂無諍願智，　　無礙解等德。	037	Namely, the merits of non-contention, aspiration-prayer cognition, unobstructed understanding, and so forth.

['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b12_13']	世尊復有無量功德，與餘聖者及異生共，謂無諍、願智、無礙解、通、靜慮、無色等至、等持、無量解脫、勝處、遍處等。	世尊復有無量功德，與餘聖者及異生共，謂無諍、願智、無礙解、通、靜慮、無色等至、等持、無量解脫、勝處、遍處等。	037	The World-Honored One also has immeasurable merits shared with other noble ones and ordinary beings, namely, non-contention, aspiration-prayer cognition, unobstructed understanding, spiritual powers, meditative absorptions, formless attainments, samādhis, immeasurable liberations, spheres of mastery, and spheres of totality, and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b13_15']	隨其所應，謂前三門唯共餘聖，通、靜慮等亦共異生。	隨其所應，謂前三門唯共餘聖，通、靜慮等亦共異生。	037	According to their respective applications, the first three are only shared with other noble ones, while spiritual powers, meditative absorptions, and so forth are also shared with ordinary beings.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b15_11']	雖佛身中一切功德行相清淨殊勝自在與聲聞等功德有殊，然依類同說名為共。	雖佛身中一切功德行相清淨殊勝自在與聲聞等功德有殊，然依類同說名為共。	037	Although all the merits in the Buddha's body are pure in aspects, superior, and sovereign, they are said to be shared based on the similarity of their categories, differing from the merits of śrāvakas and others.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b16_6']	且共餘聖三功德中，無諍云何？	且共餘聖三功德中，無諍云何？	037	Moreover, among the three qualities of the other saints, what is non-conflict?

['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b17_0']	無諍世俗智，　　後靜慮不動，	無諍世俗智，　　後靜慮不動，	037	Non-conflict is conventional knowledge, unshakable in the fourth meditation,
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b18_13']	三洲緣未生，　　欲界有事惑。	三洲緣未生，　　欲界有事惑。	037	In the three continents, conditioned by future arising, desire realm afflictions.

['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b20_15']	有阿羅漢憶昔多生，受雜類身發自他惑，由斯相續受非愛果，便作是念：	有阿羅漢憶昔多生，受雜類身發自他惑，由斯相續受非愛果，便作是念：	037	There are arhats who remember many past lives, experiencing various bodies and giving rise to afflictions for themselves and others. Due to this, they continue to experience unpleasant results. They then think like this:
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b21_18']	有煩惱身緣之起惑尚招苦果，況離煩惱具勝德身。	有煩惱身緣之起惑尚招苦果，況離煩惱具勝德身。	037	If a body with afflictions gives rise to afflictions when conditioned by it, it still attracts painful results, let alone a body free from afflictions with superior qualities.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b23_7']	思已發生如是相智，由此方便令他有情不緣己身生貪瞋等。	思已發生如是相智，由此方便令他有情不緣己身生貪瞋等。	037	Having thought this, they give rise to such a characteristic of knowledge. By this means, they cause other sentient beings not to give rise to greed, anger, etc. when conditioned by their bodies.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b24_15']	此智但以俗智為性，緣他未來修斷惑故，非無漏智此行相轉。	此智但以俗智為性，緣他未來修斷惑故，非無漏智此行相轉。	037	This knowledge is only conventional knowledge by nature, because it conditions future afflictions to be eliminated by cultivation in others, and is not a pure knowledge that turns in this aspect.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b25_14']	若無諍體是智所攝，如何說習無諍等持？	若無諍體是智所攝，如何說習無諍等持？	037	If the substance of non-conflict is included in knowledge, how is it said to cultivate the samādhi of non-conflict, etc.?
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b26_13']	此不相違，一相應品有多功德，隨說一故。	此不相違，一相應品有多功德，隨說一故。	037	This is not contradictory, because a single thought unit has many merits, and one is mentioned.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b27_12']	如一山中有種種物，隨舉一種以標山名。	如一山中有種種物，隨舉一種以標山名。	037	Just as a single mountain has many things, and one is mentioned to indicate the name of the mountain.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958b29_2']	理應無諍是智所攝，護他相續當來惑生，巧便為先事方成故。	理應無諍是智所攝，護他相續當來惑生，巧便為先事方成故。	037	Reason should be free from dispute, which is included in knowledge. Protecting the continuity of others and the arising of future afflictions, skillful means are foremost, and then affairs are accomplished.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c02_1']	然一切諍總有三種，蘊、言、煩惱有差別故，蘊諍謂死，言諍謂鬪，煩惱諍謂百八煩惱。	然一切諍總有三種，蘊、言、煩惱有差別故，蘊諍謂死，言諍謂鬪，煩惱諍謂百八煩惱。	037	However, all disputes are generally of three kinds, because of the distinctions of aggregates, speech, and afflictions. The dispute of aggregates refers to death, the dispute of speech refers to fighting, and the dispute of afflictions refers to the one hundred and eight afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c03_1']	由此俗智力能止息煩惱諍，故得無諍名。	由此俗智力能止息煩惱諍，故得無諍名。	037	Because of this, worldly knowledge can stop and eliminate the dispute of afflictions, and therefore it is called free from dispute.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c03_15']	此智但依第四靜慮，違苦因故。	此智但依第四靜慮，違苦因故。	037	This knowledge only relies on the fourth meditative absorption, because it opposes the cause of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c05_17']	第四靜慮樂通行中最為勝故，不動應果能起非餘，餘尚不能自防起惑，況能止息他身煩惱。	第四靜慮樂通行中最為勝故，不動應果能起非餘，餘尚不能自防起惑，況能止息他身煩惱。	037	Because the path of ease in the fourth meditative absorption is the most excellent, the fruit of non-retrogression can arise, not others. Others are not yet able to prevent the arising of their own afflictions, let alone be able to stop the afflictions of others' bodies.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c06_17']	此唯依止三洲人身，非北及餘，性猛利故。	此唯依止三洲人身，非北及餘，性猛利故。	037	This is only based on the human bodies of the three continents, not on the northern continent or others, because its nature is fierce and sharp.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c07_16']	緣欲未起有事惑生，勿令他惑緣我生故。	緣欲未起有事惑生，勿令他惑緣我生故。	037	It arises in response to the occurrence of actual delusions in the desire realm, in order to prevent the arising of delusions in others on the basis of oneself.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c08_15']	諸無事惑不可遮防，內起隨應總緣境故。	諸無事惑不可遮防，內起隨應總緣境故。	037	As for the non-actual delusions, it is impossible to block and prevent them, because they arise internally and are able to generally take as their objects whatever is appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c09_1']	已辯無諍。	已辯無諍。	037	The discussion of non-contentiousness is finished.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c09_6']	願智云何？	願智云何？	037	What about the cognition of vows?
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c09_9']	頌曰：	頌曰：	037	The verse states:
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c10_13']	願智能遍緣，　　餘如無諍說。	願智能遍緣，　　餘如無諍說。	037	The cognition of vows can universally take as its object. The rest is explained as in the case of non-contentiousness.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c11_2']	論曰：	論曰：	037	The treatise states:
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c12_2']	以願為先引妙智起，如願而了，故名願智。	以願為先引妙智起，如願而了，故名願智。	037	It is called the cognition of vows because it is able to understand in accordance with the vow, drawing forth wondrous cognition by taking the vow as its forerunner.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c13_11']	此智自性地種姓身與無諍同，但所緣別，以一切法為所緣故。	此智自性地種姓身與無諍同，但所緣別，以一切法為所緣故。	037	The intrinsic nature, stage, type, and body of this cognition are the same as those of non-contentiousness, but its object is different, because it takes all dharmas as its object.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c14_1']	如何願智能知未來？	如何願智能知未來？	037	How can the cognition of vows know the future?
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c14_10']	審觀過現而比知故。	審觀過現而比知故。	037	Because it is able to infer it by carefully observing the past and present.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c15_8']	如觀稼穡有盛有微，比知其田有良有薄。	如觀稼穡有盛有微，比知其田有良有薄。	037	It is just as one observes that crops are sometimes abundant and sometimes meager, and infers that the fields are sometimes fertile and sometimes poor.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c15_18']	若爾，何故立願智名？	若爾，何故立願智名？	037	If this is so, why is it called the cognition of vows?
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c16_7']	有學異生亦能知故。	有學異生亦能知故。	037	because learners and ordinary beings can also know it.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c16_17']	不爾，所知定不定故。	不爾，所知定不定故。	037	If this were not so, then what is to be known would not be definitely so.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c18_15']	而聞傳說諸大聲聞記未來事有不定者，非起願智有此謬知，餘俗智觀所記別故。	而聞傳說諸大聲聞記未來事有不定者，非起願智有此謬知，餘俗智觀所記別故。	037	It is said by transmission that when the great disciples make predictions about future events, they are sometimes wrong, but this is not because their knowledge of vows is mistaken. This is because they make predictions by means of other worldly knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c20_5']	或彼所記無不定失，但觀於始不觀終故，如先降雨未至地間。	或彼所記無不定失，但觀於始不觀終故，如先降雨未至地間。	037	Or, it is not the case that their predictions are wrong, but they only see the beginning and do not see the end, just as rain falls from the sky but does not reach the ground.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c21_14']	為羅怙羅之所承棄，先所懷孕其實是男，彼於後時轉形成女。	為羅怙羅之所承棄，先所懷孕其實是男，彼於後時轉形成女。	037	For example, Rahula was originally a boy, but later he changed into a girl.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c23_5']	王舍城鬼初戰得勝，後為廣嚴諸鬼摧伏，人欲相伐鬼先戰故。	王舍城鬼初戰得勝，後為廣嚴諸鬼摧伏，人欲相伐鬼先戰故。	037	Or, for example, the ghosts of Rājagṛha were victorious in the first battle, but later they were defeated by the ghosts of Vaiśālī. This is because the ghosts fight first when humans want to fight.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c25_5']	或實願智方見未來，然加行時先起比智，觀過現世准度未來，引願智生方能真見。	或實願智方見未來，然加行時先起比智，觀過現世准度未來，引願智生方能真見。	037	Or, it is true that knowledge of vows directly sees the future, but when one is preparing to make a prediction, one first generates inferential knowledge and observes the past and present in order to infer the future. Only after this can one truly see the future by generating knowledge of vows.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c26_13']	即由此故能知無色，謂先觀彼因行等流，有比智生引真願智。	即由此故能知無色，謂先觀彼因行等流，有比智生引真願智。	037	On the basis of this, one can also know the formless realm. That is, one first contemplates the causes and outflowing results of the formless realm, and inferential knowledge is produced. This induces the true knowledge of vows.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c28_3']	或觀欲色死生時心，比度而知所生從處，引生願智方能實知。	或觀欲色死生時心，比度而知所生從處，引生願智方能實知。	037	Or, one contemplates the mind of death and birth in the realms of desire and form, and by inference one knows the place of rebirth. This induces the knowledge of vows and one is then able to truly know.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0958c29_11']	或比智知亦無有失，以證比智所緣必同，若比不知如何能證？	或比智知亦無有失，以證比智所緣必同，若比不知如何能證？	037	Or, it is also not a mistake to say that inferential knowledge knows. Because the object of the knowledge of realization and inferential knowledge must be the same. If one does not know by inference, how can one realize?
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a01_10']	是則願智應不可言力能遍緣三界三世。	是則願智應不可言力能遍緣三界三世。	037	Then it follows that the knowledge of vows should not be said to be able to universally take the three realms and three times as objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a04_17']	不時解脫諸阿羅漢，欲於彼境正了知時，先作要期願我知彼，後入邊際第四靜慮以為加行，從此無間如先願力引正智起，於所期境皆如實知。	不時解脫諸阿羅漢，欲於彼境正了知時，先作要期願我知彼，後入邊際第四靜慮以為加行，從此無間如先願力引正智起，於所期境皆如實知。	037	When a perfected being of non-obstructed liberation wishes to correctly understand the objects of the three realms, he first makes a vow, “May I know them.” Later, he enters the fourth meditative absorption of the limit of the world as a preliminary practice. Immediately after this, in accordance with the power of the vow, he induces the arising of correct knowledge and fully understands the objects of the vow.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a05_8']	邊際定言，如後當釋。	邊際定言，如後當釋。	037	The term “limit of the world” will be explained later.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a06_7']	此願智力能知過去，與宿住智差別云何？	此願智力能知過去，與宿住智差別云何？	037	How does the power of this knowledge of vows differ from the knowledge of past abodes?
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a07_6']	願智通知自相共相，諸宿住智知共非餘。	願智通知自相共相，諸宿住智知共非餘。	037	The knowledge of the object of one's vow and the knowledge of others' minds know both the specific and general characteristics, while the knowledge of past abodes only knows the general characteristics and not the specific ones.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a08_6']	知共相中亦有差別，願智明了，宿住不然。	知共相中亦有差別，願智明了，宿住不然。	037	Within the knowledge of the general characteristics, there are also distinctions. The knowledge of the object of one's vow is clear, while the knowledge of past abodes is not.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a09_4']	於現所緣對他心智，辯差別相如理應思。	於現所緣對他心智，辯差別相如理應思。	037	The distinction between the knowledge of others' minds in the present object should be considered in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a09_9']	已辯願智。	已辯願智。	037	The knowledge of the object of one's vow has been explained.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a09_15']	無礙解云何？	無礙解云何？	037	What are the unobstructed understandings?
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a09_18']	頌曰：	頌曰：	037	The verse states:
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a10_0']	無礙解有四，　　謂法義詞辯，	無礙解有四，　　謂法義詞辯，	037	There are four unobstructed understandings, namely the unobstructed understanding of dharmas, meanings, expressions, and eloquence.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a11_13']	名義言說道，　　無退智為性。	名義言說道，　　無退智為性。	037	They are by nature the non-retrogressive cognition of names, meanings, expressions, and paths.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a12_0']	法詞唯俗智，　　五二地為依，	法詞唯俗智，　　五二地為依，	037	The unobstructed understanding of dharmas and expressions is only worldly cognition, and they are based on the first two stages.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a13_0']	義十六辯九，　　皆依一切地，	義十六辯九，　　皆依一切地，	037	The unobstructed understanding of meanings is based on all stages, and the unobstructed understanding of eloquence is based on nine stages.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a14_13']	但得必具四，　　餘如無諍說。	但得必具四，　　餘如無諍說。	037	One who obtains one necessarily possesses all four, and the rest are explained like the unobstructed understanding of non-conflict.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a15_2']	論曰：	論曰：	037	The treatise states:
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a16_15']	諸無礙解總說有四，一法無礙解、二義無礙解、三詞無礙解、四辯無礙解。	諸無礙解總說有四，一法無礙解、二義無礙解、三詞無礙解、四辯無礙解。	037	The unobstructed understandings are generally said to be four: the unobstructed understanding of dharmas, the unobstructed understanding of meanings, the unobstructed understanding of expressions, and the unobstructed understanding of eloquence.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a18_4']	此四總說如其次第，以緣名、義、言及說道，不可退轉智為自性。	此四總說如其次第，以緣名、義、言及說道，不可退轉智為自性。	037	These four are generally said to be, in their order, the unretrogressive knowledges that have as their objects names, meanings, words, and the path.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a19_3']	謂無退智緣能詮法名、句、文身立為第一。	謂無退智緣能詮法名、句、文身立為第一。	037	That is, unretrogressive knowledge that has as its object the names, phrases, and syllables that express dharmas is established as the first.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a20_2']	趣所詮義說之為名，即是表召法自性義。	趣所詮義說之為名，即是表召法自性義。	037	The path to the expressed meaning is called a name, which is to say, it reveals the meaning of the intrinsic nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a21_1']	辯所詮義說之為句，即是辯了法差別義。	辯所詮義說之為句，即是辯了法差別義。	037	The discrimination of the expressed meaning is called a phrase, which is to say, it discriminates the meaning of the specific characteristics of dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a22_9']	不待義聲獨能為覺，生所依託說之為文，即是迦遮、吒多波等。	不待義聲獨能為覺，生所依託說之為文，即是迦遮、吒多波等。	037	It is not necessary to have the sound of the meaning in order to generate understanding, which is said to be a syllable, which is to say, it is the basis for the generation of understanding.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a23_16']	理應有覺不待義聲，此覺不應無所緣境，此所緣境說之為文。	理應有覺不待義聲，此覺不應無所緣境，此所緣境說之為文。	037	It is reasonable to have understanding without the sound of the meaning, but this understanding should not be without an object, and this object is said to be a syllable.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a24_15']	文謂不能親目於義，但與名句為詮義依。	文謂不能親目於義，但與名句為詮義依。	037	A syllable is not able to directly indicate meaning but only serves as the basis for the expression of meaning by names and phrases.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a25_14']	此三能持諸所詮義及軌生解，故名為法。	此三能持諸所詮義及軌生解，故名為法。	037	These three are able to hold all the expressed meanings and generate understanding, and for that reason they are called dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a26_13']	即三自性說之為身，自性體身名差別故。	即三自性說之為身，自性體身名差別故。	037	The three natures are called bodies because they are the substance of the bodies and are different names for them.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a28_2']	三與聲義極相隣雜，為境生覺別相難知，故說身言顯有別體。	三與聲義極相隣雜，為境生覺別相難知，故說身言顯有別體。	037	The three are extremely mixed with the meaning of sounds, and it is difficult to know their distinct characteristics when they arise as objects of consciousness. Therefore, the word body is used to show that they have separate substances.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0959a29_2']	若無退智緣一切法，所有勝義立為第二義。	若無退智緣一切法，所有勝義立為第二義。	037	If there is no regressing cognition that takes all dharmas as its object, the supreme truth is established as the second truth.

Then they carefully observe the characteristics of the body and mind of others. Through this added effort, they gradually succeed. Once accomplished, without observing their own mind and form, they are able to truly know the minds of others.
['ZH_T29_1563_037:0961a07_2']	諸有欲修宿住通者，先自審察次前滅心，漸復逆觀此生分位，前前差別至結生心，乃至能憶知中有前一念名自宿住。	諸有欲修宿住通者，先自審察次前滅心，漸復逆觀此生分位，前前差別至結生心，乃至能憶知中有前一念名自宿住。	037	Those who wish to cultivate the supernormal knowledge of the recollection of past lives first carefully observe the mind that has just ceased, and then gradually reverse their observation to the state of this life, further and further back, to the mind of the linking of rebirth, and finally they are able to recollect and know the one thought of the intermediate state prior to this life, which is called their own past lives.

When it becomes habitual, one is also able to recollect by skipping over. All that is recollected is that which has been experienced. One recollects the Pure Abodes because one has heard about them in the past.
