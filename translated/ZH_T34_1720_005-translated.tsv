Within these two there are provisional and true, therefore they must be opened and revealed. Opening and revealing these two then the twelve divisions of the canon and the eighty thousand dharma treasures are all clearly understood.

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0396c28_2']	昔在鹿苑人機猶雜，盛說三乘未明一理，爾時以權隱於真實，故一乘之理為權教所閉。	昔在鹿苑人機猶雜，盛說三乘未明一理，爾時以權隱於真實，故一乘之理為權教所閉。	In the past at the Deer Park, the capacities of people were still mixed, and the three vehicles were extensively taught without clarifying the one principle. At that time, the provisional concealed the true, so the principle of the one vehicle was closed by the provisional teaching.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a02_1']	今王城赴感，乃應大機顯於真實，真實既顯則廢除昔教，昔教被廢故方便門開，一理既彰則真實相顯，故云開方便門示真實相。	今王城赴感，乃應大機顯於真實，真實既顯則廢除昔教，昔教被廢故方便門開，一理既彰則真實相顯，故云開方便門示真實相。	Now, responding to the assembly in the capital city, it accords with the great capacity and manifests the true reality. Since the true reality is manifested, it abolishes the teachings of the past. Since the teachings of the past are abolished, the gate of skillful means is opened. Since the one principle is manifested, the characteristic of true reality is revealed. Therefore, it is said to open the gate of skillful means and reveal the characteristic of true reality.

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a07_5']	所以然者，昔不言三是方便，故方便門閉；	所以然者，昔不言三是方便，故方便門閉；	The reason for this is that in the past, the three were not said to be skillful means, so the gate of skillful means was closed;
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a07_19']	今詺三為方便，故方便門開也。	今詺三為方便，故方便門開也。	Now, since the three are referred to as skillful means, the gate of skillful means is opened.

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a12_19']	今明三乘是方便，故方便門開，此乃是廢於三實、開三方便，故云開方便門。	今明三乘是方便，故方便門開，此乃是廢於三實、開三方便，故云開方便門。	Now, it is clarified that the three vehicles are expedient means, so the door of expedient means is opened. This is precisely the abandonment of the three truths and the opening of the three expedient means, thus it is said to open the door of expedient means.

In the Huayan Sutra, various good and wise advisors have various Dharma gates, such as playing in the sand or playing in each other's company, which are all Dharma gates.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a20_16']	今亦爾，如來有二種門：	今亦爾，如來有二種門：	Now it is also like this. The Tathagata has two kinds of gates:

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a23_19']	昔不說一是真實，故真實門閉；	昔不說一是真實，故真實門閉；	In the past, it was not said that one is the true aspect, so the door of the true aspect was closed;
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a24_13']	今說一是真實，故真實門開也。	今說一是真實，故真實門開也。	Now it is said that one is the true aspect, so the door of the true aspect is opened.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a25_16']	二者此方便法門復通實相，故三乘方便為一乘門。	二者此方便法門復通實相，故三乘方便為一乘門。	Second, this skillful means Dharma gate also leads to the true aspect, so the skillful means of the three vehicles is the gate of the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a26_7']	實相亦有二義故名門：	實相亦有二義故名門：	The true aspect also has two meanings, so it is called a gate:

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a28_9']	二者能通方便故為方便作門。	二者能通方便故為方便作門。	Second, it is a gate because it is a skillful means that enables one to penetrate through.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a28_13']	有人言：	有人言：	Some people say:
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397a29_12']	通相之功乃由乎一極，故一為方便之門；	通相之功乃由乎一極，故一為方便之門；	The function of the common characteristic is based on the ultimate one, therefore one is the gate of skillful means;
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397b01_10']	級引之功顯彰於三，故三為真實之相。	級引之功顯彰於三，故三為真實之相。	The function of gradual guidance is manifested in the three, therefore the three are the characteristics of the true reality.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397b02_13']	言非三則方便之門得開，悟唯一則真實之相可示。	言非三則方便之門得開，悟唯一則真實之相可示。	If it is not the three, then the gate of skillful means can be opened; If one realizes that there is only one, then the characteristics of the true reality can be shown.

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397b05_1', 'ZH_T34_1720_005:0397b05_18']	說三為通一，則三為一門。🔽但一為三門，此從實赴權，謂出門也；	說三為通一，則三為一門。 但一為三門，此從實赴權，謂出門也；	If the three are said to penetrate the one, then the three are the gate of the one.🔽But one being the gate of the three is from the real responding to the provisional, which is called leaving the gate;

If one examines the principle, it is complete in this meaning.

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397b23_1']	由方便名顯方便義，故名為義門；	由方便名顯方便義，故名為義門；	Because the name of expedient means reveals the meaning of expedient means, therefore name is the gate of meaning;

['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397c01_4']	今一異昔三，此一在三外，故一非三一、三非一三。	今一異昔三，此一在三外，故一非三一、三非一三。	The one of the present is different from the three of the past, and this one is outside the three, therefore the one is not the three and the one, and the three are not the one and the three.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397c02_15']	如此一三皆是執見，今破此病故云於一佛乘分別說三，故三是一三；	如此一三皆是執見，今破此病故云於一佛乘分別說三，故三是一三；	In this way, the one and the three are all views of attachment. Now, in order to break this illness, it is said that the one Buddha vehicle is explained as three, therefore the three are the three of the one;
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397c03_11']	汝等所行是菩薩道，故一是三一。	汝等所行是菩薩道，故一是三一。	The path you are practicing is the bodhisattva path, therefore the one is the one of the three.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397c04_2']	以三是一三，三豈異一？	以三是一三，三豈異一？	Since the three are the three of the one, how can the three be different from the one?
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397c04_12']	一是三一，一豈異三？	一是三一，一豈異三？	Since the one is the one of the three, how can the one be different from the three?
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0397c05_1']	故名三一因緣之義。	故名三一因緣之義。	Therefore, it is called the principle of the three and the one being causes and conditions.

If the function of the five turbidities is strong, it can obstruct the principle of the future fruit. The principle cannot be revealed, which is the meaning of closed.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0403a03_4']	如來出世說此經教，而眾生開除五濁障累，佛果知見即顯，故名為開。	如來出世說此經教，而眾生開除五濁障累，佛果知見即顯，故名為開。	When the Tathāgata appears in the world and expounds this sūtra, sentient beings open up and remove the obstructions of the five turbidities. The Buddha's knowledge and insight into the fruit are then revealed, so it is called revealed.
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0403a04_8']	言清淨者，五濁在心，當果之理不顯，即有穢累之義；	言清淨者，五濁在心，當果之理不顯，即有穢累之義；	As for purity, when the five turbidities are in the mind, the principle of the future fruit is not revealed, so there is the meaning of defilement and accumulation;
['ZH_T34_1720_005:0403a05_12']	今五濁既不能為障，即當果之理既顯然，故名清淨也。	今五濁既不能為障，即當果之理既顯然，故名清淨也。	Now that the five turbidities are no longer able to obstruct, the principle of the future fruit is then revealed, so it is called pure.

Although one has the future knowledge and insight, one cannot know oneself. Now, wanting to make them know, one gives rise to the understanding of the hearing-penetration. Therefore, it is called revealing the Buddha's knowledge and insight.🔽Furthermore, it makes one attain the understanding of the contemplation-penetration, called realizing the Buddha's knowledge and insight.
