['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777a19_18']	此佛世尊是一切智，能於諸法最極難知自共相中覺無邪亂；	此佛世尊是一切智，能於諸法最極難知自共相中覺無邪亂；	This Buddha-World-Honored One is the Omniscient One. He is able to awaken to the self-characteristics and common characteristics of all dharmas, which are extremely difficult to know, without error or confusion.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777a21_7']	雖非遍知而亦能知，如佛教行定得果故，如有智者善鑒良醫。	雖非遍知而亦能知，如佛教行定得果故，如有智者善鑒良醫。	Although he does not know everything, he is still able to know, just as one who practices the Buddha's teachings will attain the fruits. It is like a wise person who skillfully examines a good doctor.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777a23_14']	如世有醫，先審病者風熱淡等所起疾源，復如實觀性習二體、年時處等種種不同，為欲蠲除說授方藥。	如世有醫，先審病者風熱淡等所起疾源，復如實觀性習二體、年時處等種種不同，為欲蠲除說授方藥。	In the world, there are doctors who first examine the source of a patient's illness, whether it is caused by wind, heat, or other factors. They then accurately observe the patient's constitution, habits, age, time, location, and other differences, and prescribe medicine to cure the illness.

He further observes in accordance with reality the seeds of the two kinds of wholesome dharmas, the latent tendencies of resolve, and their ability to perfect themselves, in order to cause their temporary and permanent cessation. He expounds the methods of the two paths of subduing and eliminating.

The afflictions that have been cultivated and increased since beginningless [time] gradually disappear, and the attainment of the cessation of greed and so forth increases in excellence in one's own body according to the depth of the path.

['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b11_7']	此不應記諸別異答，無知起故。	此不應記諸別異答，無知起故。	This should not be answered with different answers, because it arises from ignorance.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b18_7']	又於前際說不可知，此即自顯是無知故，又不先覺孫陀利緣及縱彼朋造諸惡故，又於戰遮婆羅門女所起謗毀不能遣故，又先聽許提婆達多於佛法中而出家故，又於外道嗢達洛迦先自不知命存亡故，又不預定波吒釐城當有如斯難事起故，又不懸記自佛法中當有部執十八異故，又說諸業有不定故。	又於前際說不可知，此即自顯是無知故，又不先覺孫陀利緣及縱彼朋造諸惡故，又於戰遮婆羅門女所起謗毀不能遣故，又先聽許提婆達多於佛法中而出家故，又於外道嗢達洛迦先自不知命存亡故，又不預定波吒釐城當有如斯難事起故，又不懸記自佛法中當有部執十八異故，又說諸業有不定故。	Moreover, it is said that the past cannot be known, which itself shows that he does not know. Moreover, he did not first awaken to the circumstances of Sundarī, and he indulged his friends in committing various evils. Moreover, he was unable to dispel the slander of the brāhmaṇa woman Carinī. Moreover, he previously allowed Devadatta to go forth in the Buddha's Dharma. Moreover, he did not know beforehand whether the heretic Udraka was alive or dead. Moreover, he did not predict in advance that such difficulties would arise in the city of Pataliputra. Moreover, he did not make a general prediction that there would be eighteen different doctrinal positions within his own Dharma. Moreover, he said that there is indeterminacy regarding karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b18_16']	外道謗詞略述如是。	外道謗詞略述如是。	The heretical accusations are briefly presented in this way.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b20_14']	彼諸外道固執在懷，一切智尊雖設種種善權化導，而未能令於正等覺生淨信解。	彼諸外道固執在懷，一切智尊雖設種種善權化導，而未能令於正等覺生淨信解。	Although the Omniscient Honored One employed various skillful means to guide them, he was still unable to cause them to give rise to pure faith and understanding in perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b21_13']	具勝福慧求真理人，方能測量一切智海。	具勝福慧求真理人，方能測量一切智海。	Only those who possess superior blessings and wisdom and seek the truth can fathom the ocean of omniscience.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b22_12']	今我勇銳發正勤心，如理順宜且少開悟。	今我勇銳發正勤心，如理順宜且少開悟。	Now I am vigorous and have given rise to the mind of right effort, and I have been enlightened to a small extent in accordance with the principles.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b23_7']	言於請問別異而答，謂作是言：	言於請問別異而答，謂作是言：	As for answering differently from the question, it means to say:
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b24_15']	此不應記諸別異答無知起者，此不應理，其所立因非決定故。	此不應記諸別異答無知起者，此不應理，其所立因非決定故。	This should not be answered. The arising of ignorance in answering differently is unreasonable, because the reason given is not definite.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b24_20']	且應詳審：	且應詳審：	First, one should carefully examine:
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b25_17']	為佛世尊於所請問，由無知故言不應記？	為佛世尊於所請問，由無知故言不應記？	Is it because the World-Honored Buddha lacks knowledge that he says it should not be answered to what is asked?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b27_6']	為觀問者懷聰叡慢，非卒能令如理信解，故雖了達而不為記。	為觀問者懷聰叡慢，非卒能令如理信解，故雖了達而不為記。	Or is it because he sees that the questioner harbors the conceit of being wise and cannot be made to believe in accordance with the principles immediately, so although he has understanding he does not answer?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b27_11']	如有矯問：	如有矯問：	As there is a deceptive question:
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b28_1']	諸石女兒為黑為白？	諸石女兒為黑為白？	Are the children of a barren woman black or white?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b28_6']	終不為記。	終不為記。	In the end, it will not be answered.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777b28_15']	豈別有方能祛彼疾？	豈別有方能祛彼疾？	How could there be a separate method that can remove their illness?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c01_3']	如是外道執我為真，矯問如來死後為有為無等事，世尊告言：	如是外道執我為真，矯問如來死後為有為無等事，世尊告言：	In the same way, the non-Buddhists grasp the self as real and deceptively ask the Tathāgata about such matters as whether there is existence after death or not, and the World-Honored One says:
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c01_8']	此不應記。	此不應記。	This should not be answered.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c02_2']	佛意說我實無有故不應記別。	佛意說我實無有故不應記別。	The Buddha's intention is to say that because the self does not really exist, it should not be answered separately.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c03_1']	此顯若法都非實有，不應於中為差別問。	此顯若法都非實有，不應於中為差別問。	This shows that if a dharma is utterly unreal, one should not ask about its distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c03_19']	或佛世尊善權方便，為令調伏故不為記。	或佛世尊善權方便，為令調伏故不為記。	Or the World-Honored Buddha skillfully uses expedient means to tame and subdue, so he does not make predictions.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c04_17']	此不為記是調伏因，非由無知作別異答。	此不為記是調伏因，非由無知作別異答。	This not making predictions is the cause for taming and subduing, not because of ignorance, making a different answer.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c05_16']	又不應謂佛無辯才，彼問論道所不攝故。	又不應謂佛無辯才，彼問論道所不攝故。	One should not say that the Buddha lacks eloquence, because that question is not included in the path of discussion.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c06_16']	若彼所問論道攝者，佛不為記，可無辯才。	若彼所問論道攝者，佛不為記，可無辯才。	If that question were included in the path of discussion, and the Buddha did not make a prediction, then he could be said to lack eloquence.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c07_18']	非於此中如理難問少分可得，何容乃謂佛無辯才？	非於此中如理難問少分可得，何容乃謂佛無辯才？	But in this case, there is not even a little bit of a reasonable question to be asked. How could it be said that the Buddha lacks eloquence?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c10_14']	又聽法者心不慇故、執我見故、根未熟故，世尊無方可令信解，故於所問置而不記，故不應以不記所問謂大仙尊非一切智。	又聽法者心不慇故、執我見故、根未熟故，世尊無方可令信解，故於所問置而不記，故不應以不記所問謂大仙尊非一切智。	Moreover, because the listener's mind is not sincere, because they cling to the view of self, and because their faculties are not yet mature, the World-Honored One has no way to make them understand and believe, so he sets aside the question and does not answer it. Therefore, one should not say that the Great Sage is not omniscient because he does not answer the question.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c12_8']	言於初際說不可知，此即自顯是無知者，此亦非理，無法不應為智境故。	言於初際說不可知，此即自顯是無知者，此亦非理，無法不應為智境故。	To say that the beginning is unknowable is to reveal one’s own ignorance, and this is unreasonable, because there is no dharma that should not be the object of knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c13_7']	於有法境智若不生，可謂如來非一切智。	於有法境智若不生，可謂如來非一切智。	If knowledge does not arise with regard to existent dharmas as objects, then the Tathāgata would not be omniscient.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c13_17']	本無初際，智何所知？	本無初際，智何所知？	Since there is no beginning, what would knowledge know?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c14_7']	無故不知，豈成無智？	無故不知，豈成無智？	If it is unknown because it does not exist, how can it constitute non-knowledge?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c14_17']	若爾，何故不但說無？	若爾，何故不但說無？	If that is so, why not just say it does not exist?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c15_5']	此說不容更立因故。	此說不容更立因故。	This statement does not allow for the establishment of a cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c16_4']	若謂應立不可知因，此亦不然，非決定故。	若謂應立不可知因，此亦不然，非決定故。	If it is said that a cause of unknowability should be established, this is also unreasonable, because it is not certain.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c17_3']	或法雖有，緣闕不知，故不可知非無因性。	或法雖有，緣闕不知，故不可知非無因性。	Even though a dharma exists, if the conditions are lacking, it is not known. Therefore, unknowability is not due to the absence of a cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c18_11']	若立無性為不知因，即畢竟無可為同喻，為容因故說不可知。	若立無性為不知因，即畢竟無可為同喻，為容因故說不可知。	If the absence of a nature is established as the cause of unknowability, then absolute non-existence could be used as a similar example. In order to allow for a cause, unknowability is spoken of.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c19_11']	若謂無因有不成失，此不應理，非不成故。	若謂無因有不成失，此不應理，非不成故。	If it is said that the absence of a cause results in the fault of incompleteness, this is unreasonable, because it is not incomplete.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c21_7']	生死初際若定非無，即初際身無無因起，初無因者後亦應無，以先後身無異因故。	生死初際若定非無，即初際身無無因起，初無因者後亦應無，以先後身無異因故。	If the beginning of samsara definitely is not nonexistent, then the body at the beginning would not arise without a cause. If the beginning has no cause, then the end also should be without cause, because the previous and subsequent bodies do not have different causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c22_6']	若許爾者，即諸所行淨不淨業皆應無果；	若許爾者，即諸所行淨不淨業皆應無果；	If you admit this, then all the pure and impure actions that are performed would all be without results.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c23_6']	既不許然，即先所立初際無故，非不成因。	既不許然，即先所立初際無故，非不成因。	Since you do not admit this, then the previous argument that the beginning is not established and therefore is not a cause is not valid.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c24_14']	若謂生死無初際故應如虛空無後際者，亦不應理，外種同故。	若謂生死無初際故應如虛空無後際者，亦不應理，外種同故。	If you say that because samsara has no beginning, it should be like space and have no end, this also is not reasonable, because external seeds are the same.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c26_2']	如外穀麥後因前生，雖無初際，遇火水等諸燒爛緣而永壞滅。	如外穀麥後因前生，雖無初際，遇火水等諸燒爛緣而永壞滅。	Just as external grains and wheat are caused by what precedes them, although they have no beginning, they are destroyed forever when they encounter fire, water, and other causes of burning and rotting.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c28_18']	如是生死煩惱業因展轉相生，雖無初際，而由數習貪瞋癡等對治力故，生死諸蘊畢竟不生即為後際，空無生故，後際可無。	如是生死煩惱業因展轉相生，雖無初際，而由數習貪瞋癡等對治力故，生死諸蘊畢竟不生即為後際，空無生故，後際可無。	In the same way, the causes of affliction and karma in samsara are produced by mutual transformation. Although they have no beginning, because of the power of the repeated cultivation of the antidotes to craving, hatred, and delusion, the aggregates of samsara are finally not produced. This is the end. Because of the nonproduction of space, the end can be nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c29_8']	生死有生，豈無後際？	生死有生，豈無後際？	But samsara has production. How can it be without an end?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0777c29_17']	現見生法定有終時。	現見生法定有終時。	It is directly seen that produced phenomena definitely have an end.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0778a02_6']	生死既生，理必歸滅，故說初際是不可知，無故為因，其義善立。	生死既生，理必歸滅，故說初際是不可知，無故為因，其義善立。	Since birth and death are produced, it logically must return to cessation. Therefore, it is said that the initial limit is unknowable. The reason of no cause is well established.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0778a03_4']	故不應以不知初際，謂佛世尊非一切智。	故不應以不知初際，謂佛世尊非一切智。	Therefore, one should not say that because the initial limit is unknown, the World-Honored Buddha is not omniscient.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0778a04_8']	言不先覺孫陀利緣及縱彼朋造諸惡者，此亦非理。	言不先覺孫陀利緣及縱彼朋造諸惡者，此亦非理。	As for saying that he did not first know the matter of Sundarī and indulged his followers in committing evil, this is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0778a05_2']	雖先覺知，為避多過故不自顯。	雖先覺知，為避多過故不自顯。	Although he knew it before, in order to avoid many faults, he did not reveal it himself.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0778a06_19']	若佛先言，我無此事，為此事者自是餘人，即彼朋流惡心轉盛，諸中庸者咸共懷疑。	若佛先言，我無此事，為此事者自是餘人，即彼朋流惡心轉盛，諸中庸者咸共懷疑。	If the Buddha first said, I do not have this matter, and said that those who do this are other people, then the stream of evil thoughts of his followers would become even more rampant, and those of neutral disposition would all harbor doubts.
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0778a07_8']	如是過愆為佛為彼？	如是過愆為佛為彼？	In this way, would the fault be the Buddha's or theirs?
['ZH_T29_1563_001:0778a08_7']	又大人法不顯他非，佛是大人豈揚他惡？	又大人法不顯他非，佛是大人豈揚他惡？	Moreover, it is the way of great people not to expose the faults of others. The Buddha is a great person. How could he proclaim the evil of others?

In it, dharmas are most clearly manifested without obstruction, and therefore it is called space.

This is because the five material consciousnesses and a part of the mental consciousness cannot arise with regard to objects that have already perished, because they must have objects that exist simultaneously with them.
