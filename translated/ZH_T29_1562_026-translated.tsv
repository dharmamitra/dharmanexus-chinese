['ZH_T29_1562_026:0485c23_18']	6 六辯緣起品第三之六結生識後、六處生前，中間諸位總稱名色。	6 六辯緣起品第三之六結生識後、六處生前，中間諸位總稱名色。	026	Chapter 6, Section 3: The six discernments, part 6. The various stages in between after birth-linking consciousness and before the arising of the six sense bases are collectively called name-and-form.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0485c24_16']	豈不已生身意二處，應言此在四處生前？	豈不已生身意二處，應言此在四處生前？	026	Why not say that the already arisen body and mind sense bases should be said to be before the arising of the four sense bases?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0485c25_15']	大德邏摩率自意釋，度名色已方立處名。	大德邏摩率自意釋，度名色已方立處名。	026	The Venerable Rāma explains according to his own understanding that the name of the sense bases is established only after name-and-form has been transcended.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0485c26_15']	意體雖恒，有非意處，要是觸處方得處名。	意體雖恒，有非意處，要是觸處方得處名。	026	Although the essence of the mind is always present, it is not the mind sense base. It must be the sense base of touch in order to obtain the name of a sense base.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0485c28_9']	滅盡定中意處不壞，由斯亦許有意識生，然闕餘緣故無有觸，是故非識。	滅盡定中意處不壞，由斯亦許有意識生，然闕餘緣故無有觸，是故非識。	026	In the attainment of cessation, the mind sense base is not destroyed. Therefore, it is also allowed that there is birth of mental consciousness. However, it lacks other conditions, so there is no contact. Therefore, it is not consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0485c29_12']	名色位中，身意二根可得名處，故說名色在六處前。	名色位中，身意二根可得名處，故說名色在六處前。	026	In the stage of name-and-form, the two sense bases of body and mind can be called sense bases. Therefore, it is said that name-and-form is before the six sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a02_1']	名色為緣生於六處，此唯率意妄設虛言，都無正理及正教故。	名色為緣生於六處，此唯率意妄設虛言，都無正理及正教故。	026	Name-and-form as a condition gives rise to the six sense bases. This is merely a false statement made by someone’s imagination, because it is completely devoid of correct reasoning and correct teaching.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a03_1']	謂無理教可以證成意法為緣生於意識。	謂無理教可以證成意法為緣生於意識。	026	This is because there is no reasoning or teaching that can prove that mental objects as a condition give rise to mental consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a03_19']	於中亦有不名三和，或有三和而無有觸。	於中亦有不名三和，或有三和而無有觸。	026	In this case, there is no union of the three, or there is a union of the three but no contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a04_18']	若謂此位有劣三和，觸亦應然，寧全非有？	若謂此位有劣三和，觸亦應然，寧全非有？	026	If it is said that in this state there is an inferior union of the three, contact should also be so. How can it be completely nonexistent?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a05_7']	彼宗許觸即三和故。	彼宗許觸即三和故。	026	This is because their school accepts that contact is precisely the union of the three.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a06_14']	又彼亦許有處無觸，由彼自說滅盡定中意處不壞而無有觸。	又彼亦許有處無觸，由彼自說滅盡定中意處不壞而無有觸。	026	Moreover, they also accept that there is a place where there is no contact, because they themselves say that in the concentration of cessation the sense base of mind is not destroyed but there is no contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a07_14']	既爾，於識名色位中，何法壞心令非意處？	既爾，於識名色位中，何法壞心令非意處？	026	If this is so, then in the state of name-and-form, what dharma destroys the mind and makes it not the sense base of mind?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a09_4']	又彼執離根境識三，有何別緣親能生觸，而言闕故識有觸無？	又彼執離根境識三，有何別緣親能生觸，而言闕故識有觸無？	026	Moreover, what other separate condition can give rise to contact apart from the three of sense faculty, object, and consciousness? They say that because of its absence, consciousness has no contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a10_3']	非佛世尊曾有此說，但如童竪自室戲言。	非佛世尊曾有此說，但如童竪自室戲言。	026	The World-Honored Buddha has never said this, but it is like the childish and foolish speaking in their own rooms.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a10_17']	又說名色為觸緣故，如告慶喜：	又說名色為觸緣故，如告慶喜：	026	Also, because it is said that name-and-form is a condition for contact. As it is said to Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a11_6']	若有問言觸有緣耶？	若有問言觸有緣耶？	026	If someone asks, Does contact have a condition?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a11_11']	應答言有。	應答言有。	026	You should answer, It does.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a12_1']	彼若復問此觸何緣？	彼若復問此觸何緣？	026	If they further ask, What is the condition for that contact?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a12_10']	應正答言所謂名色。	應正答言所謂名色。	026	You should correctly answer, It is called name-and-form.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a13_17']	既爾，豈不六處生前有名色故必應有觸，是則無時意非意處。	既爾，豈不六處生前有名色故必應有觸，是則無時意非意處。	026	If that is so, wouldn't there be name-and-form before the arising of the six sense bases? Therefore contact would necessarily exist. In that case, there would be no time when the mind is not the sense base of mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a15_6']	若謂如是，生觸名色非六處前名色支位，如世尊告阿難陀言：	若謂如是，生觸名色非六處前名色支位，如世尊告阿難陀言：	026	If it is said that in this way, the contact and name-and-form that arise are not the name-and-form prior to the six sense bases, as the World-Honored One said to Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a16_10']	識在嬰孩及童子位便斷壞者，名色必無增長廣大。	識在嬰孩及童子位便斷壞者，名色必無增長廣大。	026	If consciousness is cut off in the stages of infancy and childhood, name-and-form will certainly not grow and expand.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a16_19']	如是名色豈六處前？	如是名色豈六處前？	026	Is this name-and-form not prior to the six sense bases?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a17_8']	故今觸緣即彼名色。	故今觸緣即彼名色。	026	Therefore, the condition for contact now is precisely that name-and-form.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a18_1']	此救亦非理，說識為緣故。	此救亦非理，說識為緣故。	026	This rebuttal is also unreasonable, because it is said that consciousness is a condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a19_7']	謂能為緣生觸名色，世尊即說彼結生識為緣，如契經言：	謂能為緣生觸名色，世尊即說彼結生識為緣，如契經言：	026	That is to say, it can be a condition for the arising of contact and name-and-form. The World-Honored One then said that the consciousness that links rebirth is a condition, as a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a20_5', 'ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a20_8']	識若不入母胎中者，此名色成羯剌藍不？🔽不也？	識若不入母胎中者，此名色成羯剌藍不？ 不也？	026	If consciousness does not enter the mother's womb, would this name-and-form develop into kalala?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a20_11']	世尊！	世尊！	026	No, World-Honored One.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a20_16']	乃至廣說。	乃至廣說。	026	Thus it is explained in detail.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a22_3']	次說名色與觸為緣，非此位中可得即說為嬰孩等，故不成救。	次說名色與觸為緣，非此位中可得即說為嬰孩等，故不成救。	026	Next, it is said that name-and-form is the condition for contact. It cannot be said that in this stage it is an infant, etc., so the argument is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a23_10']	今此位中已有何色為緣生觸，而言此位名色為緣生於觸耶？	今此位中已有何色為緣生觸，而言此位名色為緣生於觸耶？	026	What form exists in this stage that is the condition for the arising of contact, such that it is said that in this stage name-and-form is the condition for the arising of contact?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a24_10']	有說此位唯名生觸，約位總說名色為緣。	有說此位唯名生觸，約位總說名色為緣。	026	Some say that in this stage only name gives rise to contact. Speaking generally in terms of stages, it is said that name-and-form is the condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a25_17']	有言此約名色滿位，身觸為緣能生身識，故說名色與觸為緣。	有言此約名色滿位，身觸為緣能生身識，故說名色與觸為緣。	026	Some say that this refers to the stage when name-and-form is complete. Bodily contact as a condition can give rise to body consciousness, so it is said that name-and-form is the condition for contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a27_6']	今謂此中名色緣觸，就位總說言具二緣，若別說緣或名或二。	今謂此中名色緣觸，就位總說言具二緣，若別說緣或名或二。	026	Now, it is said that in this case, name-and-form is the condition for contact. Speaking generally in terms of stages, it is said that both are conditions. If speaking specifically, it is said that either name or the two are conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a28_5']	或即六處為緣生觸，故說名色與觸為緣。	或即六處為緣生觸，故說名色與觸為緣。	026	Or, the six sense bases are the condition for the arising of contact, so it is said that name-and-form is the condition for contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486a29_4']	然名色位非無有觸，以許此中有意識故。	然名色位非無有觸，以許此中有意識故。	026	However, this does not mean that there is no contact in the stage of name-and-form, because it is admitted that there is mental consciousness in this stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b01_12']	曾無處說離根境等別有觸緣，而說此中有識無觸，有言無理。	曾無處說離根境等別有觸緣，而說此中有識無觸，有言無理。	026	There is nowhere a statement that apart from faculties, objects, etc., there is a separate condition for contact, but it is said that in this stage there is consciousness but no contact. This statement is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b02_7']	又彼所說，意體雖恒，有非意處。	又彼所說，意體雖恒，有非意處。	026	Also, they say that although the essence of mind is always present, it is not a sense base.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b02_12']	此何所表？	此何所表？	026	What does this mean?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b03_10']	若是處體而不施設，此何所以竟不說因？	若是處體而不施設，此何所以竟不說因？	026	If it is the essence of a sense base but is not established as such, what is the reason for not saying that it is a sense base?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b04_11']	又言觸處方立處名，許是處體，此言便壞。	又言觸處方立處名，許是處體，此言便壞。	026	Also, they say that a sense base is established only when it is called a sense base. If it is admitted that it is the essence of a sense base, this statement is destroyed.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b05_1']	若非處體，便違契經。	若非處體，便違契經。	026	If it is not the essence of a sense base, then it contradicts the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b06_10']	一切法者謂十二處，然佛世尊處處顯示，離十二處無別有法。	一切法者謂十二處，然佛世尊處處顯示，離十二處無別有法。	026	The term all dharmas refers to the twelve sense bases. The Buddha, the World Honored One, has shown in various places that apart from the twelve sense bases there are no other dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b07_10']	亦不可說於諸法中，有非處體而處所攝。	亦不可說於諸法中，有非處體而處所攝。	026	It cannot be said that among the dharmas there are those that are not the essence of a sense base but are included in the sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b08_8']	雖一極微不能生觸，而無現在唯一極微。	雖一極微不能生觸，而無現在唯一極微。	026	Although a single atom cannot produce contact, there is no present single atom.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b09_8']	非五識身所依緣者亦是處體，得彼相故。	非五識身所依緣者亦是處體，得彼相故。	026	The essence of the sense bases is also not the object-fields of the five consciousnesses, because it obtains the characteristics of those.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b10_7', 'ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b10_17']	是故所說，意體雖恒有非意處，非應理說。🔽若爾，何故不作是言：	是故所說，意體雖恒有非意處，非應理說。 若爾，何故不作是言：	026	Therefore, it is not reasonable to say that the essence of manas is always present but not the sense base of manas.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b11_15']	四處生前說為名色，識名色位用減劣故。	四處生前說為名色，識名色位用減劣故。	026	If this is so, why not say that the four sense bases that arise before are called name-and-form? Because the function of consciousness in the state of name-and-form is weak.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b12_15']	謂二位中諸內處體，用猶減劣，不立處名。	謂二位中諸內處體，用猶減劣，不立處名。	026	That is, in the two states, the essence of the internal sense bases is still weak and is not called a sense base.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b13_14']	若此位中處用圓勝，即於此位可立處名。	若此位中處用圓勝，即於此位可立處名。	026	If the function of the sense bases is complete and superior in this state, then in this state it can be called a sense base.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b14_6']	或位不同，體有異故。	或位不同，體有異故。	026	Or because the states are not the same, the essence is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b15_6']	謂六處位所得意身，用勝體圓，非前所得。	謂六處位所得意身，用勝體圓，非前所得。	026	That is, the function of the manas and body obtained in the state of the six sense bases is superior and the essence is complete, not what was obtained before.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b16_5']	如是六處，名色為緣，故說名色緣生六處。	如是六處，名色為緣，故說名色緣生六處。	026	Thus, the six sense bases are conditioned by name-and-form, so it is said that the six sense bases are born from name-and-form.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b18_1']	或此位方得全分現行故，謂要支開位方得男女根，爾時諸識身乃容皆現起。	或此位方得全分現行故，謂要支開位方得男女根，爾時諸識身乃容皆現起。	026	Or because in this state one obtains complete actual dharmas, that is, one obtains the male and female faculties only in the state of the six sense bases. At that time, the various consciousnesses are then able to arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b19_1']	故身意處六處位中，體用現行方得全分。	故身意處六處位中，體用現行方得全分。	026	Therefore, in the six sense bases, the body and mind bases are complete in terms of substance, function, and actual activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b19_14']	由斯故說六處生前是名色位。	由斯故說六處生前是名色位。	026	For this reason, it is said that before the six sense bases, this is the stage of name-and-form.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b19_19']	此說為善。	此說為善。	026	This explanation is good.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b20_17']	餘廣分別此名色支，於此後文當更顯示。	餘廣分別此名色支，於此後文當更顯示。	026	The detailed analysis of this stage of name-and-form will be further revealed in the later text.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b22_6']	即此名色為緣所生，具眼等根未三和合，中間諸蘊說名六處。	即此名色為緣所生，具眼等根未三和合，中間諸蘊說名六處。	026	Based on this name-and-form as a condition, the six sense bases arise. Before the three are combined, the various aggregates in the middle are called the six sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b24_6']	謂名色後六處已生，乃至根境識未具和合位，下中上品次第漸增，於此位中總名六處。	謂名色後六處已生，乃至根境識未具和合位，下中上品次第漸增，於此位中總名六處。	026	That is to say, after name-and-form, the six sense bases have already arisen, but before the sense faculties, objects, and consciousness are fully combined, the stages of upper, middle, and lower gradually increase. In this stage, they are collectively called the six sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b25_5']	豈於此位諸識不生，而得說三未具和合？	豈於此位諸識不生，而得說三未具和合？	026	In this stage, do the various consciousnesses not arise, so that it can be said that the three are not yet fully combined?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b26_13']	且無一位意識不生，名色位中身識亦起，況六處位言無三和？	且無一位意識不生，名色位中身識亦起，況六處位言無三和？	026	There is no stage where mental consciousness does not arise. In the stage of name-and-form, the body consciousness also arises. How can it be said that the three are not yet combined in the stage of the six sense bases?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b27_15']	所餘識身亦容得起，然非恒勝，故未立三和名。	所餘識身亦容得起，然非恒勝，故未立三和名。	026	The other groups of consciousness may also arise, but they are not always superior, so they are not yet called the combination of the three.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486b28_13']	於此位中唯六處勝，故約六處以標位別。	於此位中唯六處勝，故約六處以標位別。	026	In this stage, only the six sense bases are predominant, and therefore the stage is named after them.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c01_6']	既許六處緣名色生，一念名色後即應立六處，如一念識後即立名色支。	既許六處緣名色生，一念名色後即應立六處，如一念識後即立名色支。	026	Since it is admitted that the six sense bases are born with name-and-form as a condition, then immediately after one moment of name-and-form, the six sense bases should be established, just as the member of name-and-form is established immediately after one moment of consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c02_5']	此責不然，六處要待名色成熟方得生故。	此責不然，六處要待名色成熟方得生故。	026	This criticism is not valid, because the six sense bases must wait for name-and-form to mature before they can be born.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c02_14']	何法說為名色成熟？	何法說為名色成熟？	026	What dharma is said to be the maturity of name-and-form?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c04_16']	無別有法，然名色位下中品時，未能為緣引生六處，要增上位方能為緣引生六處，即名成熟。	無別有法，然名色位下中品時，未能為緣引生六處，要增上位方能為緣引生六處，即名成熟。	026	There is no separate dharma, but when name-and-form is in the lower and middle stages, it is not yet able to act as a condition to give rise to the six sense bases. It must increase to the upper stage before it can act as a condition to give rise to the six sense bases, and then it is called mature.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c07_1']	要待名色熟六處方生，如因種轉變芽方得起或非離名色六處可得生，如要依雲方得降雨。	要待名色熟六處方生，如因種轉變芽方得起或非離名色六處可得生，如要依雲方得降雨。	026	The six sense bases are born only when name-and-form matures, just as a sprout is born only when the transformation of a seed occurs, or the six sense bases cannot be born apart from name-and-form, just as rain falls only when there are clouds.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c08_2']	若爾，六處非名色生，如何可說言名色緣六處？	若爾，六處非名色生，如何可說言名色緣六處？	026	If this is so, then the six sense bases are not born from name-and-form. How can it be said that name-and-form is a condition for the six sense bases?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c09_1']	諸為緣者，謂有助能，未必親生方成緣義。	諸為緣者，謂有助能，未必親生方成緣義。	026	Those that are conditions are those that have the power to assist, and it is not necessary that they be the proximate producers in order to be conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0486c09_20']	如果雖為引業所牽，滿業若無，果終不起。	如果雖為引業所牽，滿業若無，果終不起。	026	For example, although a fruit is attracted by a leading action, if there is no completing action, the fruit will never arise.

Such examples are frequently seen in the holy teachings.

Desire and greed, etc., can also be called this, because only the passions of the realm of form and the formless realm are proximate causes for the flourishing of the view of a self in the realm of man. The passions of the realm of desire do not assist the view of a self in causing it to flourish as do the passions of the two upper realms.

['ZH_T29_1562_026:0490b16_14']	彼謂諸見由愛勢力種種熾盛名廣滋長，如是所說前後相違不了經義，引之無益。	彼謂諸見由愛勢力種種熾盛名廣滋長，如是所說前後相違不了經義，引之無益。	026	They say that various views flourish due to the power of craving, called increasing and spreading widely. Such explanations contradict each other and do not understand the meaning of the sūtra. Citing them is useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0490b17_4']	如何彼說前後相違？	如何彼說前後相違？	026	How do they say that there is a contradiction between the previous and later [passages]?
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0490b19_2']	謂能執故說名為執，如是執體即是五見，彼即不棄故名不捨，是謂後言違於前說。	謂能執故說名為執，如是執體即是五見，彼即不棄故名不捨，是謂後言違於前說。	026	Because they grasp, they are called grasping. Such grasping is precisely the five views. They are not abandoned, so they are called not abandoned. This is called the later statement contradicting the previous statement.
['ZH_T29_1562_026:0490b21_1']	謂彼前說，於內法中執取為我名我語取，或我語取，見取所收，無別性故，應唯三取。	謂彼前說，於內法中執取為我名我語取，或我語取，見取所收，無別性故，應唯三取。	026	They previously said that grasping and clinging to the internal dharmas as the self is called the grasping of self-existence, or the grasping of self-existence is included in the grasping of views, because there is no separate nature, there should only be three graspings.

There is no such fault, because the view that grasps is included in the grasping at views among the four kinds of grasping, and the precepts and prohibitions that are grasped are included in the grasping at precepts and prohibitions among the four kinds of grasping.

The objects grasped are established separately as the other graspings.
