['ZH_T04_0212_026:0747c13_14']	觀此義已如來引喻，欲使後生明達其事，猶若夜光之虫處在幽冥，布其光明遠有所照，謂為己明無有及者，值日天子放百千光明昇于東方，爾時無復有夜光虫明，顏色黤𪑓像如純墨，是故說曰，夜光照於冥，至日未出間，日光布大明，夜光便黤𪑓也。	觀此義已如來引喻，欲使後生明達其事，猶若夜光之虫處在幽冥，布其光明遠有所照，謂為己明無有及者，值日天子放百千光明昇于東方，爾時無復有夜光虫明，顏色黤𪑓像如純墨，是故說曰，夜光照於冥，至日未出間，日光布大明，夜光便黤𪑓也。	Having observed this meaning, the Tathāgata draws an analogy, wishing to make later generations understand the matter, just as a firefly insect dwells in the dark, spreading its light to illuminate far away, thinking that its own brightness is unmatched, but when the sun, the heavenly prince, releases a hundred thousand lights and ascends in the east, at that time there are no more fireflies shining, and its color becomes dim like pure ink. Therefore it is said, The firefly shines in the dark, until the sun has not yet risen, the sunlight spreads great brightness, and the firefly immediately becomes dim.

Some know through examination, some know through entering concentration, and some awaken through hearing teachings. These three types of people in the world each consider themselves superior.

['ZH_T04_0212_026:0747c22_11']	是故說曰，察者布光明，如來未出頃，佛出放大明，無察無聲聞也。	是故說曰，察者布光明，如來未出頃，佛出放大明，無察無聲聞也。	Therefore it is said, Those who examine emit light, before the Tathāgata appears. When the Buddha appears and emits great light, there is no examination or śrāvakas.

If they think to themselves that people in the world enjoy themselves with the five desires, then that is considered permanent. Therefore, it is said:

They point to each other and discuss this, secretly hearing the Buddha's teachings praising nirvana, which is without birth, without cessation, without thoughts of arising or ceasing, and also without singing, praising, rejoicing, dancing, or the five clans of relatives, coming and going, advancing and stopping, gardens and pools. Since it is completely devoid of these, how can it be permanent?

Fools do not understand and take it as not true. Therefore, it is said, They do not reach firmness due to giving rise to wrong views.
['ZH_T04_0212_026:0748a08_0']	牢而知牢者，　　不牢知不牢，	牢而知牢者，　　不牢知不牢，	The firm know firmness, the unfirm know unfirmness,

['ZH_T04_0212_026:0748a14_14']	諸佛世尊永息之室，其有眾生入此室者，寵位至不以增歡，毀辱逼不以加慼，與倒見異其辭、邪部殊其趣，冥然太虛永息不起，智者之所慕，非愚之所習。	諸佛世尊永息之室，其有眾生入此室者，寵位至不以增歡，毀辱逼不以加慼，與倒見異其辭、邪部殊其趣，冥然太虛永息不起，智者之所慕，非愚之所習。	The eternal resting place of the World-Honored Buddhas, if there are sentient beings who enter this room, even reaching the highest position does not bring additional joy, and even being humiliated and oppressed does not bring added sorrow. It differs in words from those with inverted views and differs in meaning from the deviant group. It is utterly empty, eternally at rest and does not arise. It is what the wise admire, not what the foolish practice.
['ZH_T04_0212_026:0748a18_21']	欲至彼室者，要涉八正之徑路，求度十二之洪崖，以渡生死之嶮岸，安神無為之澹然，顧眄悠悠之楚酷，苦哉愚惑之滋甚，是故說曰，牢而知牢者，不牢知不牢，彼人求於牢，正治以為本也。	欲至彼室者，要涉八正之徑路，求度十二之洪崖，以渡生死之嶮岸，安神無為之澹然，顧眄悠悠之楚酷，苦哉愚惑之滋甚，是故說曰，牢而知牢者，不牢知不牢，彼人求於牢，正治以為本也。	Those who wish to reach that room must traverse the path of the eightfold right path, seek to cross the great ravine of the twelve [links of dependent origination], and use it to cross the perilous shore of birth and death, peacefully entrusting the spirit to the tranquil state of non-action, looking back at the distress and cruelty of the long-lasting world, alas! The foolishness and delusion have greatly increased, therefore it is said: The firm one who knows firmness, the unfirm one who knows unfirmness, that person seeks firmness, taking right practice as the basis.

Some say the aggregates are firm, some say the roots of the fetters are firm. Within this, they give rise to thoughts and do not distinguish true from false. Although they may leave the home-life and study the path, they go against and practice deviant ways. Therefore it is said: the foolish think it is firm.
['ZH_T04_0212_026:0748a27_20']	反被九結縛者，人之修道要當捨家，遇惡知識指授邪徑，捨故結縛反被九結，如蛾投火不顧後慮，斯由愛深固，是故說曰，反被九結縛，如鳥投羅網，斯由愛深固也。	反被九結縛者，人之修道要當捨家，遇惡知識指授邪徑，捨故結縛反被九結，如蛾投火不顧後慮，斯由愛深固，是故說曰，反被九結縛，如鳥投羅網，斯由愛深固也。	As for being bound by the nine fetters in return, when people cultivate the Way, they must leave home. If they encounter bad friends who point out wrong paths, they abandon the old fetters and are bound by the nine fetters in return. It is like a moth falling into a fire without regard for the consequences. This is because love is deep and firm. Therefore, it is said, being bound by the nine fetters in return, like a bird falling into a net. This is because love is deep and firm.

Hearing it, one gains faith without much further thought. Therefore, it is said, those who harbor doubts.

Therefore it is said, Dhyana concentration can completely eliminate.

Therefore it is said, Cultivating the brahma practice without vexation.

Even if they wear the kasaya robe, they do not get rid of the three poisons. This does not lead to the Way. Therefore it is said, without dust, free from dust.

The afflictions of the three poisons are completely exhausted without remainder. Although one attains arhatship, one does not enter concentration. One responds to circumstances without recording them, and only then knows one's mistakes. Cultivating precepts to remove defilements does not lose one's enlightened mind. Therefore, it is said, If one can remove defilements and cultivate precepts, concentration, and wisdom.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
