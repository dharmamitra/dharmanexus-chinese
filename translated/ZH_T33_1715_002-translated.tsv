Therefore, it is known that the four assemblies truly have doubts. Looking up to you means wanting you to answer, and to me means wanting me to ask. How can it be said that the four assemblies have no doubts?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0586c02_15']	文殊仍復起第二伏難言，汝今若言四眾果有疑者，但神通瑞相此事微細，我今云何專爾相答，汝但待佛出定自應問佛也。	文殊仍復起第二伏難言，汝今若言四眾果有疑者，但神通瑞相此事微細，我今云何專爾相答，汝但待佛出定自應問佛也。	002	Mañjuśrī still raised a second subcommentary, saying, If you now say that the four assemblies truly have doubts, but the auspicious signs of spiritual powers are subtle, how can I now answer you exclusively? You should just wait for the Buddha to emerge from concentration and you should ask the Buddha yourself.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0586c04_2']	是故彌勒即用第二偈釋此伏難言，佛既入定何時當出？	是故彌勒即用第二偈釋此伏難言，佛既入定何時當出？	002	Therefore, Maitreya immediately used the second verse to explain this subcommentary, saying, Since the Buddha has entered concentration, when will he emerge?

Since you are a bodhisattva who is next in line to become a buddha, you should slightly lower your mind and together resolve the doubts of the assembly. How can you insist that I alone answer?

To be precise, I now do not know why the Tathāgata manifests these auspicious signs. Is it to expound to the assembly the wonderful Dharma that Śākyamuni has attained?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0586c15_11']	為當欲為大眾受記將來妙果？	為當欲為大眾受記將來妙果？	002	Or is it to bestow predictions to the assembly of the wonderful fruits of the future?

['ZH_T33_1715_002:0586c20_5']	是故彌勒仍用第四偈復釋此伏難言，祇我此意非是決斷之意，但瑞相所表難可定判，云何用我猶預之心答大眾？	是故彌勒仍用第四偈復釋此伏難言，祇我此意非是決斷之意，但瑞相所表難可定判，云何用我猶預之心答大眾？	002	Therefore, Maitreya again used the fourth verse to resolve this potential objection, saying, My intention is not to make a definitive decision, but the meaning expressed by the auspicious signs is difficult to determine. Why use my uncertain mind to answer the great assembly?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0586c22_17']	是故言「示諸佛土眾寶嚴淨」，此間瑞相及見諸佛，明他方瑞相此非小緣，若是小緣可令我決，既非小緣仁者應答也。	是故言「示諸佛土眾寶嚴淨」，此間瑞相及見諸佛，明他方瑞相此非小緣，若是小緣可令我決，既非小緣仁者應答也。	002	Therefore, it says, Showing the various buddha lands adorned with myriad treasures. The auspicious signs here and seeing the buddhas clarify the auspicious signs in other directions. This is not a minor matter. If it were a minor matter, it could allow me to decide. Since it is not a minor matter, you, Venerable One, should answer.

['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587a15_3']	第三從「諸善男子如過去無量無邊」以下，廣出曾見之事，引古證今，事同廣答彌勒也。	第三從「諸善男子如過去無量無邊」以下，廣出曾見之事，引古證今，事同廣答彌勒也。	002	The third part, from Good men, in the past, immeasurable and boundless... below, extensively presents the events seen before, citing the ancient to prove the present, and similarly answers Maitreya in detail.

['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587a19_10']	所以有此四重說法者，若實論文殊則是往古諸佛龍種如來，今既迹居釋迦弟子，那得灼然分別決判，應須次第階漸，先一往思惟忖度。	所以有此四重說法者，若實論文殊則是往古諸佛龍種如來，今既迹居釋迦弟子，那得灼然分別決判，應須次第階漸，先一往思惟忖度。	002	The reason for these four layers of teaching the Dharma is that if the true text is Mañjuśrī, who was the dragon-like Tathāgata of the past, now that he is a disciple of Śākyamuni, how can he clearly distinguish and decide? He should gradually ascend the steps, first thinking and pondering.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587a21_6']	雖復一往思惟忖度，但此思惟忖度非是空然，是故第二言我於過去曾見此事。	雖復一往思惟忖度，但此思惟忖度非是空然，是故第二言我於過去曾見此事。	002	Although he thinks and ponders, this thinking and pondering is not in vain, so in the second [part] he says I have seen this matter before.

Therefore, the Tathāgata's explanation of the cause below first briefly explains the revealing of three and the manifestation of one, which corresponds to this sentence want to speak of the great Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587b26_15']	下明果之中，先略說開近顯遠之義，亦與此欲說大法句相應。	下明果之中，先略說開近顯遠之義，亦與此欲說大法句相應。	002	The explanation of the effect below first briefly explains the revealing of the near and the manifestation of the far, which also corresponds to this sentence want to speak of the great Dharma.

This clarifies that when Mañjuśrī contemplated and considered, after the Tathāgata emerged from samādhi, he would not only briefly speak of the great Dharma of cause and effect, but would also extensively explain the meaning of the great Dharma of one cause and one effect.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c02_16']	是故如來下明因中有廣說開三顯一斷疑生信之義，則與此演大法義句相應；	是故如來下明因中有廣說開三顯一斷疑生信之義，則與此演大法義句相應；	002	Therefore, the passage below about the extensive explanation of opening the three and revealing the One, cutting off doubts and giving rise to faith in the cause, corresponds to this phrase about expounding the great Dharma;

['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c06_12']	「雨大法雨」者，此下中間三句為前後兩句作譬，自分為兩意：	「雨大法雨」者，此下中間三句為前後兩句作譬，自分為兩意：	002	As for raining down the great Dharma rain, the three phrases in the middle are used as metaphors for the two phrases before and after. It is divided into two meanings:
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c07_10']	第一句通為開三顯一、開近顯遠作譬；	第一句通為開三顯一、開近顯遠作譬；	002	the first phrase is used as a metaphor for both opening the three and revealing the One, and opening the near and revealing the far;
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c09_6']	第二兩句各別作譬，吹螺一句為開三與開近作譬，擊鼓為顯一與顯遠作譬也。	第二兩句各別作譬，吹螺一句為開三與開近作譬，擊鼓為顯一與顯遠作譬也。	002	the second two phrases are used as metaphors separately - the phrase blowing the conch is used as a metaphor for opening the three and opening the near, and the drum is used as a metaphor for revealing the One and revealing the far.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c10_18']	所以名作雨大法雨者，但昔三乘人執三因決定別異，無有得佛之義；	所以名作雨大法雨者，但昔三乘人執三因決定別異，無有得佛之義；	002	The reason it is called raining down the great Dharma rain is because in the past, those of the three vehicles clung to the three causes as definitely separate, without the meaning of attaining Buddhahood;
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c12_3']	且又昔日二乘小心狹劣，不能廣化眾生沾被萬物；	且又昔日二乘小心狹劣，不能廣化眾生沾被萬物；	002	Moreover, in the past, the two vehicles had narrow and inferior petty minds, unable to widely transform sentient beings and benefit all beings;
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c13_5']	又執三果，究竟無有進求之心，此是枯旱之義。	又執三果，究竟無有進求之心，此是枯旱之義。	002	Moreover, they clung to the three fruits as ultimate, without the intention to seek further progress, this is the meaning of drought.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c16_7']	如我今日思惟忖度，如來出定之後必說大乘因，明三乘人皆成菩提受記得佛，明佛果更有，復倍為期，此則是雨大法雨，沾潤之義也。	如我今日思惟忖度，如來出定之後必說大乘因，明三乘人皆成菩提受記得佛，明佛果更有，復倍為期，此則是雨大法雨，沾潤之義也。	002	As I contemplate and consider today, after the Tathāgata emerges from samādhi, he will certainly expound the cause of the Great Vehicle, clarifying that the people of the three vehicles will all attain bodhi and receive the prediction of becoming a buddha, clarifying that the fruition of buddhahood has even more to be attained, this is the meaning of the great Dharma rain moistening and nourishing.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c21_11']	「吹大法螺」者，外國言吹螺改號，但昔日三乘人執昔日三因三果，自言決定不可移改，明今日如來出定之後，必說無有三乘之別、三果之殊，此則改昔日三乘號令，立今日一因一果之號，是故下經文言開方便門，即是改三乘之號。	「吹大法螺」者，外國言吹螺改號，但昔日三乘人執昔日三因三果，自言決定不可移改，明今日如來出定之後，必說無有三乘之別、三果之殊，此則改昔日三乘號令，立今日一因一果之號，是故下經文言開方便門，即是改三乘之號。	002	Blowing the great Dharma conch means in foreign countries, blowing the conch changes the title. But in the past, the people of the three vehicles clung to the three causes and three fruits of the past, saying for themselves that they were definite and could not be changed. It is clear that after the Tathāgata emerged from samādhi today, he must have spoken of the non-existence of the distinctions of the three vehicles and the three fruits. This then changes the title of the three vehicles of the past and establishes the title of the one cause and one fruit of today. Therefore, the text below says opening the gate of skillful means, which is changing the title of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c21_16']	何以知之？	何以知之？	002	How do we know this?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c23_7']	昔日不言三乘是方便，如來下既言開方便門，此則改昔日號令也。	昔日不言三乘是方便，如來下既言開方便門，此則改昔日號令也。	002	In the past, it was not said that the three vehicles are skillful means. When the Tathāgata speaks of opening the gate of skillful means below, this then changes the title of the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c24_5']	「擊大法鼓」者，前吹螺改號，今嚴鼓誡兵。	「擊大法鼓」者，前吹螺改號，今嚴鼓誡兵。	002	Striking the great Dharma drum means previously blowing the conch changes the title, now adorning the drum and warning the troops.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c28_1']	夫誡兵之法，便萬心同契齊卛物情，將欲有所為作，表明今日如來應說一因一果，是故下言示真實相，時眾不可不欣心澍渴仰欣，形異心同齊竪意志欣聞異唱也。	夫誡兵之法，便萬心同契齊卛物情，將欲有所為作，表明今日如來應說一因一果，是故下言示真實相，時眾不可不欣心澍渴仰欣，形異心同齊竪意志欣聞異唱也。	002	The method of warning the army is to unify the minds of myriad people and harmonize the feelings of all beings. When one wishes to do something, one should clarify today's one cause and one effect spoken by the Tathāgata. Therefore, the text below says showing the true reality. The assembly at that time could not but be delighted in their hearts and thirsty for looking up. The different forms have the same mind, and they all stand with their intentions to delight in hearing the different calls.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0587c29_11']	又言前吹螺一句，正明改昔三因三果號令，作今一因一果之號令。	又言前吹螺一句，正明改昔三因三果號令，作今一因一果之號令。	002	It also says that the previous blowing of the conch shell in one phrase clearly changes the former three causes and three effects into the present one cause and one effect.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0588a03_11']	嚴鼓誡兵者，將欲前進破陣，內合昔日止言斷四住地煩惱，今日猶有無明住地煩惱，時應斷此無明住地煩惱，故言嚴鼓誡兵也。	嚴鼓誡兵者，將欲前進破陣，內合昔日止言斷四住地煩惱，今日猶有無明住地煩惱，時應斷此無明住地煩惱，故言嚴鼓誡兵也。	002	Arranging the drum to warn the army means that when one wishes to advance and break through the formation, internally combining the words of the past to cut off the afflictions of the four abodes, today there are still the afflictions of the abode of ignorance. At that time, one should cut off these afflictions of the abode of ignorance, so it says arranging the drum to warn the army.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0588a05_12']	「諸善男子我於過去曾見此瑞」，此下第二自言曾見瑞相之事，然此意小復分明略答。	「諸善男子我於過去曾見此瑞」，此下第二自言曾見瑞相之事，然此意小復分明略答。	002	Good men, I have seen this auspicious sign in the past, this is the second part, where he himself says that he has seen the auspicious signs in the past. However, this meaning is slightly clearer and briefly answered.

This shows that Mañjuśrī is not only directly seeing what was seen before, but also deeply understands the meaning of what was seen before. It clarifies that the Tathāgata must explain the principle of returning to the same, the teaching of non-duality. In this way, he deeply understands the Buddha's mind and subtly knows the sage's intention.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0588a10_17']	又釋前明引古，後明證今也。	又釋前明引古，後明證今也。	002	Another explanation is that the former clarifies drawing on the past, and the latter clarifies verifying the present.

['ZH_T33_1715_002:0588a18_1']	故第一段名為已見事與曾見事同，第二段名為當見事與曾見事應同也。	故第一段名為已見事與曾見事同，第二段名為當見事與曾見事應同也。	002	Therefore, the first part is called the present seeing of events being the same as the previously seen events, and the second part is called the future seeing of events being the same as the previously seen events.

The correct principle is easy to understand, but the subtle meaning is difficult to illuminate. Therefore, it is like a skilled craftsman using an axe on a piece of wood. If this piece of wood is round and straight, easy to work with, and the axe and square are used to make a single vessel, one may not yet realize the person's skillful ability.

The previous situation is subtle and not the true principle of the world, but this skillful wisdom can subtly illuminate the capacities of beings and skillfully expound the three teachings in response to their subtle dispositions.

Now, one teaching, one principle, one capacity, and one person, these four one realms are the true reality. The Tathāgata's wisdom accords with this true reality and illuminates without any meaning of bending to it. This then reveals the meaning of true wisdom and conceals the meaning of skillful means.

The reason it is said now that they arise from samādhi in peace and comfort is for the sake of setting an example for beings. But ordinary people are without wisdom. When they speak a word or utter a sound, they do so thoughtlessly, lightly, and distractedly. Now, the tathāgatas, before wishing to speak the Dharma, first demonstrate entering samādhi and contemplating principle, in order to cause ordinary people to have something to say, first calming the mind and thoughts, and then giving rise to ideas and skillfully debating. For this meaning, it is said that they arise from samādhi.

When the assembly hears that there is a very profound true wisdom and a difficult-to-understand skillful means, they give rise to doubts together, saying that the Buddha's teachings of the three vehicles in the past are all true, but now he says there is still the true and the skillful.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c02_1']	時眾于時執心漸動，是故第二三行半偈分明略說，言世尊法久後要當說真實。	時眾于時執心漸動，是故第二三行半偈分明略說，言世尊法久後要當說真實。	002	At that time, the assembly gradually moved their clinging minds, so in the second three and a half lines of verse, it clearly briefly explains, saying that the World-Honored One's Dharma after a long time will definitely explain the truth.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c03_7']	復言佛以方便力，示以三乘教，眾生處處著，引之令得出。	復言佛以方便力，示以三乘教，眾生處處著，引之令得出。	002	It also says that the Buddha uses the power of skillful means to show the teaching of the three vehicles, and sentient beings are attached everywhere, leading them to come out.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c05_5']	既分明略說三一之義，時眾疑真實之意生、執三之情動，為此義故，故言髣髴開宗。	既分明略說三一之義，時眾疑真實之意生、執三之情動，為此義故，故言髣髴開宗。	002	Having clearly and briefly explained the meaning of three and one, doubts about the true meaning arose in the assembly's mind and the attachment to three moved. For this meaning, therefore, it is said to be the semblance opening of the doctrine.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c06_18']	又就兩段之中各開為二，髣髴開宗中有二者，即是長行與偈頌為二也。	又就兩段之中各開為二，髣髴開宗中有二者，即是長行與偈頌為二也。	002	Moreover, within the two sections, each is further divided into two. There are two in the semblance opening of the doctrine, which are the prose and the verses.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c09_1']	最後三行半偈分明略說中有二者，第一一行半寄諸佛以顯一，第二兩行偈就釋迦以開三。	最後三行半偈分明略說中有二者，第一一行半寄諸佛以顯一，第二兩行偈就釋迦以開三。	002	There are two in the final three and a half lines of verse that clearly and briefly explain. The first is using the buddhas to manifest one in one and a half lines, and the second is using two lines of verse to open three in Śākyamuni.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c13_9']	且置偈，只就長行中自有二段，第一從品初竟「成就一切未曾有法」以來，詺為寄言以歎二智，第二從「舍利弗如來能種種分別巧說諸法」下竟長行，詺為寄絕言歎二智，非是絕四句，故名為絕言。	且置偈，只就長行中自有二段，第一從品初竟「成就一切未曾有法」以來，詺為寄言以歎二智，第二從「舍利弗如來能種種分別巧說諸法」下竟長行，詺為寄絕言歎二智，非是絕四句，故名為絕言。	002	Putting aside the verses, within the prose itself there are two sections. The first, from the beginning of the chapter up to accomplishing all unprecedented dharmas, is called using words to praise the two knowledges. The second, from Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is able to skillfully expound and discriminate various dharmas up to the end of the prose, is called using the ineffable to praise the two knowledges. It is not beyond the four propositions, therefore it is called the ineffable.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c13_19']	下不及上，故名絕言。	下不及上，故名絕言。	002	It is not as good as the higher, so it is called beyond words.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c14_4']	又名止言歎。	又名止言歎。	002	It is also called praising the two wisdoms by stopping words.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c16_6']	又就此二段之中各有二，寄言歎二智有二者，第一將欲歎釋迦二智，先寄言歎諸佛二智；	又就此二段之中各有二，寄言歎二智有二者，第一將欲歎釋迦二智，先寄言歎諸佛二智；	002	Furthermore, within these two sections there are two each, praising the two wisdoms by means of words has two. The first is that before praising Śākyamuni's two wisdoms, he first praises the two wisdoms of the buddhas by means of words;
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c16_17']	第二正寄言歎釋迦二智。	第二正寄言歎釋迦二智。	002	The second is correctly praising Śākyamuni's two wisdoms by means of words.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c17_9']	所以爾者，為欲況釋故。	所以爾者，為欲況釋故。	002	The reason for doing so is to make a comparison.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c20_3']	諸佛亦有實智方便智先三後一，何況釋迦亦有實智方便智先三後一，談方便智即說三乘教，語實智即是說一乘教。	諸佛亦有實智方便智先三後一，何況釋迦亦有實智方便智先三後一，談方便智即說三乘教，語實智即是說一乘教。	002	The buddhas also have the wisdom of reality and skillful means, first three then one, let alone Śākyamuni also having the wisdom of reality and skillful means, first three then one. Speaking of the wisdom of skillful means is expounding the teachings of the three vehicles, speaking of the wisdom of reality is expounding the teachings of the one vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c21_5']	此兩段中各有三文，今就歎諸佛二智有三重：	此兩段中各有三文，今就歎諸佛二智有三重：	002	Within these two sections there are three texts each. Now, within praising the two wisdoms of the buddhas there are three layers:
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c22_7']	一者正雙歎二智、二者總釋二智、三者雙結也。	一者正雙歎二智、二者總釋二智、三者雙結也。	002	First, correctly praising the two wisdoms; second, generally explaining the two wisdoms; third, doubly concluding.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c23_11']	所以明因之中對聲聞，辯果之內對大士，不告聲聞也。	所以明因之中對聲聞，辯果之內對大士，不告聲聞也。	002	Therefore, in the explanation of causes, it is contrasted with the śrāvakas, and in the explanation of effects, it is contrasted with the great beings, not with the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c26_4']	所以偏對二人者，皆逐緣作論，聲聞之中，舍利弗聰明第一，菩薩之中，彌勒是補處大士，故偏對二人顯諸下流也。	所以偏對二人者，皆逐緣作論，聲聞之中，舍利弗聰明第一，菩薩之中，彌勒是補處大士，故偏對二人顯諸下流也。	002	The reason for specifically contrasting it with these two people is that it is all based on conditions to discuss the Dharma. Among the śrāvakas, Śāriputra is the foremost in wisdom, and among the bodhisattvas, Maitreya is the great being who will succeed the Buddha. Therefore, it specifically contrasts with these two people to show the various lower streams.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c27_5']	就正雙歎二智中，先歎實智後歎方便智也。	就正雙歎二智中，先歎實智後歎方便智也。	002	In the proper double praise of the two wisdoms, it first praises true wisdom and then praises the wisdom of skillful means.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c28_14']	只就歎實智中自有二句，「諸佛智慧」一句將欲歎，故先舉實智。	只就歎實智中自有二句，「諸佛智慧」一句將欲歎，故先舉實智。	002	In the praise of true wisdom itself, there are two phrases. The phrase the wisdom of the buddhas is about to praise, so it first brings up true wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0594c29_10']	「甚深無量」此一句是第二正歎實智。	「甚深無量」此一句是第二正歎實智。	002	The phrase extremely profound and immeasurable is the second proper praise of true wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a01_13']	所以言「甚深無量」者，縱則論甚深、橫則言無量。	所以言「甚深無量」者，縱則論甚深、橫則言無量。	002	The reason for saying extremely profound and immeasurable is that if it is discussed vertically, it is called extremely profound, and if it is discussed horizontally, it is called immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a02_8']	三世諸佛皆有此實智，故言甚深；	三世諸佛皆有此實智，故言甚深；	002	The buddhas of the three times all have this true wisdom, so it is called extremely profound;
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a03_2']	橫論十方諸佛實智，故言無量。	橫論十方諸佛實智，故言無量。	002	if it is discussed horizontally, the true wisdom of the buddhas of the ten directions is called immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a03_12']	望之杳然，故言甚深；	望之杳然，故言甚深；	002	Looking at it, it is far away, so it is said to be very deep;
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a04_1']	際不可知，故言無量。	際不可知，故言無量。	002	The limit cannot be known, so it is said to be immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a04_9']	此是正歎實智也。	此是正歎實智也。	002	This is the correct praise of true wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a06_17']	「其智慧門難解難入」，此是歎方便智，就中有三，「其智慧門」一句先舉權智體，「難解難入」一句第二正歎也。	「其智慧門難解難入」，此是歎方便智，就中有三，「其智慧門」一句先舉權智體，「難解難入」一句第二正歎也。	002	The gate of wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter, this praises skillful means wisdom, and within it there are three parts. The phrase the gate of wisdom first brings up the essence of skillful means wisdom. The phrase difficult to understand and difficult to enter is the second correct praise.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a07_11']	「一切聲聞」以下第三出不知人也。	「一切聲聞」以下第三出不知人也。	002	All śrāvakas and below is the third part that identifies those who do not know.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a08_16']	方便智是實智家門，由方便智說三乘教，故實智得通。	方便智是實智家門，由方便智說三乘教，故實智得通。	002	Skillful means wisdom is the gate of true wisdom. Because of skillful means wisdom, the teachings of the three vehicles are expounded, and thus true wisdom becomes accessible.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a09_1']	何以知之？	何以知之？	002	How do we know this?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a11_17']	先說三教然後一教得宜故，如即時立門通佛出入，仍呼為佛門無異，由方便智故實智得通，是故詺方便智持作實智家門也。	先說三教然後一教得宜故，如即時立門通佛出入，仍呼為佛門無異，由方便智故實智得通，是故詺方便智持作實智家門也。	002	First, the three teachings are expounded, and then the one teaching becomes appropriate. It is like immediately setting up a gate for the Buddha to come and go through, still calling it the Buddha's gate without difference. Because of skillful means wisdom, true wisdom becomes accessible. Therefore, skillful means wisdom is designated as the gate of true wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a12_16']	今言其者，只其實智則言其家門，誰是？	今言其者，只其實智則言其家門，誰是？	002	Now, speaking of it, it is precisely the actual wisdom that is spoken of as its family and gate. Who is it?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a15_6']	則言只方便智是，而復言「難解難入」者，第二正歎方便智，言難解難入二乘人不能測此方便智，故言難解難入。	則言只方便智是，而復言「難解難入」者，第二正歎方便智，言難解難入二乘人不能測此方便智，故言難解難入。	002	It is said to be precisely the skillful means wisdom. And again, speaking of difficult to understand and difficult to enter, the second is the correct praise of skillful means wisdom, saying that the two vehicles are unable to fathom this skillful means wisdom, thus it is said to be difficult to understand and difficult to enter.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a17_7']	所以不詺作不可解不可入者，若言不可解不可入者，然佛即是能解能入，非是不可解；	所以不詺作不可解不可入者，若言不可解不可入者，然佛即是能解能入，非是不可解；	002	The reason it is not called incomprehensible or unenterable is that if it were said to be incomprehensible and unenterable, then the Buddha would be able to understand and enter it, and it would not be incomprehensible;
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a20_7']	然此理深妙難可得解，唯佛能解入，阿誰不能解不能入者，故第三則出其人，一切聲聞、辟支佛，只此二乘人等是不能解不能入者也。	然此理深妙難可得解，唯佛能解入，阿誰不能解不能入者，故第三則出其人，一切聲聞、辟支佛，只此二乘人等是不能解不能入者也。	002	However, this principle is profound and wonderful, difficult to understand, and only the Buddha can understand and enter it. Who is it that cannot understand and cannot enter? Therefore, the third reveals the people, all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, precisely these two vehicles and so forth are those who cannot understand and cannot enter.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a22_13']	「所以者何」，此下是第二總釋諸佛二智，此詺舉昔諸佛行釋二智所以，諸佛實智甚深無量者何？	「所以者何」，此下是第二總釋諸佛二智，此詺舉昔諸佛行釋二智所以，諸佛實智甚深無量者何？	002	Why is it so? This is the second general explanation of the two wisdoms of all Buddhas. This refers to using the practices of all Buddhas in the past to explain the reasons for the two wisdoms. Why is it that the true wisdom of all Buddhas is profound and immeasurable?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a23_7']	復言其智慧門難解難入者何？	復言其智慧門難解難入者何？	002	Why is it said that the gate of wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter?
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a24_16']	以佛曾親近百千萬億盡行昔日諸佛之行故，得此二智深妙也。	以佛曾親近百千萬億盡行昔日諸佛之行故，得此二智深妙也。	002	Because the Buddha has closely attended hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas in the past and practiced all their practices, he has attained these two profound and wonderful wisdoms.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a25_6']	只就此釋中自有三：	只就此釋中自有三：	002	There are three points in this explanation itself:
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a27_6']	第一「佛曾親近」以下明行本，第二「盡行諸佛」以下正明行行，第三「名稱普聞」一句結顯。	第一「佛曾親近」以下明行本，第二「盡行諸佛」以下正明行行，第三「名稱普聞」一句結顯。	002	The first, from the Buddha has closely attended below, clarifies the basis of practice. The second, from practicing all the Buddhas' practices below, clarifies the actual practice. The third, the phrase with a far-reaching reputation concludes and reveals.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a27_18']	第三雙結諸佛二智中有二：	第三雙結諸佛二智中有二：	002	The third, the double conclusion of the two wisdoms of all Buddhas, has two parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595a29_7']	第一「成就甚深未曾有法」，此則結上實智，言諸佛智慧甚深無量也。	第一「成就甚深未曾有法」，此則結上實智，言諸佛智慧甚深無量也。	002	The first, accomplishing the profound and unprecedented Dharma, concludes the above true wisdom, which states that the wisdom of all Buddhas is profound and immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595b01_17']	第二「隨宜所說意趣難解」，此結上方便智，言其智慧門難解難入也。	第二「隨宜所說意趣難解」，此結上方便智，言其智慧門難解難入也。	002	The second, The meaning of the teachings given according to suitability is difficult to understand, concludes the above wisdom of skillful means, saying that the gate of wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595b05_4']	所以言隨宜者，此方便智能隨物所宜，隨聲聞人所宜說苦集滅道，亦隨緣覺人所宜說十二因緣，亦隨菩薩人所宜說六波羅密，故言隨宜也。	所以言隨宜者，此方便智能隨物所宜，隨聲聞人所宜說苦集滅道，亦隨緣覺人所宜說十二因緣，亦隨菩薩人所宜說六波羅密，故言隨宜也。	002	The reason it is said to be according to suitability is that this wisdom of skillful means can accord with the suitability of beings. It can teach the four noble truths according to the suitability of śrāvaka disciples, it can teach the twelve links of dependent arising according to the suitability of pratyekabuddha disciples, and it can teach the six pāramitās according to the suitability of bodhisattva disciples. Therefore, it is said to be according to suitability.
['ZH_T33_1715_002:0595b07_10']	「舍利弗吾從成佛以來」，此下是寄言歎二智之中第二，詺為寄言歎釋迦權實二智，就中亦有三重：	「舍利弗吾從成佛以來」，此下是寄言歎二智之中第二，詺為寄言歎釋迦權實二智，就中亦有三重：	002	Śāriputra, since I attained Buddhahood...
