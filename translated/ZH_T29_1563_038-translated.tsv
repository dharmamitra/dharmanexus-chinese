['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c13_17']	9 辯定品辯定品第九之一如是已辯諸智差別，次當分別智所依定。	9 辯定品辯定品第九之一如是已辯諸智差別，次當分別智所依定。	Chapter 9, Part 1: Distinguishing and Ascertaining, Distinguishing and Ascertaining the First of Nine Parts. Thus far, the distinctions of various knowledges have been discussed. Next, we will distinguish the samādhis that are the bases of knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c14_16']	唯諸靜慮能具為依，故於此中先辯靜慮。	唯諸靜慮能具為依，故於此中先辯靜慮。	Only the various dhyānas can fully serve as bases, so they are first distinguished here.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c16_10']	或於先辯共功德中已辯智所成無諍等功德，餘所成德今次當辨。	或於先辯共功德中已辯智所成無諍等功德，餘所成德今次當辨。	Or, in the previously discussed common merits, the merits accomplished by knowledge such as the absence of conflict have already been discussed. The remaining accomplished merits will now be discussed next.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c17_1']	於中先辯所依止定。	於中先辯所依止定。	Among them, the samādhis that are the bases are first distinguished.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c17_10']	且諸定內靜慮云何？	且諸定內靜慮云何？	What are the dhyānas among the various samādhis?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c17_13']	頌曰：	頌曰：	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c18_0']	靜慮四各二，　　於中生已說，	靜慮四各二，　　於中生已說，	The dhyānas are four each with two, the arising within them has been explained.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c19_0']	定謂善一境，　　并伴五蘊性，	定謂善一境，　　并伴五蘊性，	Samādhi is of good and single-pointedness, with the nature of five aggregates along with its associates.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c20_13']	初具伺喜樂，　　後漸離前支。	初具伺喜樂，　　後漸離前支。	The first has initial thought, joy, and pleasure, the latter gradually removes the previous factors.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c21_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c22_1']	一切功德多依靜慮，故應先辯靜慮差別。	一切功德多依靜慮，故應先辯靜慮差別。	Since all merits mostly rely on dhyāna, we should first distinguish the differences in dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c22_13']	此總有四種，謂初二三四。	此總有四種，謂初二三四。	In general there are four kinds, called the first, second, third, and fourth.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c24_1']	豈諸靜慮無如慈等不共名想，而今但就初等四數建立別名？	豈諸靜慮無如慈等不共名想，而今但就初等四數建立別名？	Are there no names and concepts of the dharmas of the immeasurables, such as loving kindness, that are unique to the trances, and are the names of the first, second, etc., established on the basis of number alone?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c25_17']	此中非無不共名想，然無唯遍攝一地名，以諸靜慮各有二種，謂定及生有差別故。	此中非無不共名想，然無唯遍攝一地名，以諸靜慮各有二種，謂定及生有差別故。	There are not no names and concepts that are unique to the trances, but there are none that are found in all stages. Each trance is of two kinds, because there is a distinction between samādhi and birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c26_18']	諸生靜慮如先已說，謂第四八、初二、餘三。	諸生靜慮如先已說，謂第四八、初二、餘三。	The trances of birth have already been discussed above, i.e., the fourth is eight, the first two are two, and the rest are three.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c27_7']	無有別名，總詮一地。	無有別名，總詮一地。	There is no other name that generally signifies one stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c29_5']	諸定靜慮總相無別，謂此四體總而言之，皆善性攝心一境性，以善等持為自性故。	諸定靜慮總相無別，謂此四體總而言之，皆善性攝心一境性，以善等持為自性故。	The general characteristics of the samādhis of the trances are not different, because in general they are all categorized as the nature of good, i.e., one-pointedness of mind, because their intrinsic nature is that of good samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0963c29_14']	若并助伴五蘊為性。	若并助伴五蘊為性。	If they are accompanied by their adjutants, their nature is that of the five aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a01_6']	此二既同，難知差別。	此二既同，難知差別。	Since these two are the same, it is difficult to know their difference.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a02_13']	相雖無別而地有異，為顯地異就數標名，故說為初乃至第四。	相雖無別而地有異，為顯地異就數標名，故說為初乃至第四。	Although their characteristics are not different, their stages are different. In order to reveal the difference in stages, they are named according to number, and therefore they are called the first, up to the fourth.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a03_9']	此中經主自興問答，何名一境性？	此中經主自興問答，何名一境性？	Here the author of the Śāstra himself raises a question and answers it: What is meant by “one-pointedness of mind”?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a03_15']	謂專一所緣。	謂專一所緣。	It means being concentrated on a single object.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a04_15']	彼答非理，眼意二識若同一所緣，應名一境性。	彼答非理，眼意二識若同一所緣，應名一境性。	His answer is unreasonable, because if the two consciousnesses of eye and manas have the same object, they should be called one-pointedness of mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a05_5']	故於此處應求別理。	故於此處應求別理。	Therefore, we must seek another explanation here.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a07_5']	謂若依止一所依根專一所緣名一境性，豈不一念無易所緣，應一切心中皆有一境性。	謂若依止一所依根專一所緣名一境性，豈不一念無易所緣，應一切心中皆有一境性。	If it is said that being concentrated on a single object by depending on a single organ is called one-pointedness of mind, then would it not be the case that in a single moment there is no change in the object and that therefore all minds would be one-pointed?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a08_13']	理實皆有，一一剎那心心所法一境轉故，然非一切皆得定名。	理實皆有，一一剎那心心所法一境轉故，然非一切皆得定名。	In reality, all minds are one-pointed, because in each moment of mind and mental activities, they evolve with a single object, but not all are called samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a10_4']	以於此中說一境性，但為顯示由勝等持令善心心所相續而轉故。	以於此中說一境性，但為顯示由勝等持令善心心所相續而轉故。	Because in this context, one-pointedness of mind is explained as being a continuity of good mind and mental activities brought about by the power of superior samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a12_3']	若爾，即心依一根轉，引緣自境餘心續生，此即名為心一境性，應離心外無別等持。	若爾，即心依一根轉，引緣自境餘心續生，此即名為心一境性，應離心外無別等持。	If this is so, then mind evolves by depending on a single organ, and other minds continue in succession, attracted by the mind that takes its own object. This is called one-pointedness of mind, and there should be no samādhi apart from mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a12_13']	此難不然，前已說故。	此難不然，前已說故。	This objection is not valid, because it has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a13_12']	謂先廣辯心所法中，已辯等持離心別有。	謂先廣辯心所法中，已辯等持離心別有。	In the chapter on mental activities, we have already explained that samādhi is a separate dharma apart from mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a16_1']	謂若心體即三摩地，令心作等亦應無別，差別因緣不可得故，如是等難具顯如前，故非即心名三摩地。	謂若心體即三摩地，令心作等亦應無別，差別因緣不可得故，如是等難具顯如前，故非即心名三摩地。	If the essence of mind is samādhi, then that which causes the mind to be even would also not be separate, because we cannot find a cause of distinction. Such difficulties are fully explained above. Therefore samādhi is not the same as mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a16_10']	依何義故立靜慮名？	依何義故立靜慮名？	In what sense is samādhi called LIBERATION?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a17_2']	由依此寂靜方能審慮故。	由依此寂靜方能審慮故。	Liberation is so called because one is able to contemplate things well by relying on this samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a18_13']	審慮即是實了知義，如說心在定能如實了知，審慮義中置地界故。	審慮即是實了知義，如說心在定能如實了知，審慮義中置地界故。	To contemplate well is the meaning of to understand things as they really are. It is said that mind in samādhi is able to understand things as they really are. The meaning of contemplation is to place the mind in samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a19_5']	此論宗審慮定以慧為體。	此論宗審慮定以慧為體。	The principle of this treatise is that samādhi is by nature discernment.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a20_13']	依訓釋理，此是凝寂思度境處得靜慮名，定令慧生無濁亂故。	依訓釋理，此是凝寂思度境處得靜慮名，定令慧生無濁亂故。	According to the principle of etymological analysis, it is a place where the mind is calm and contemplates objects, and for that reason it is called LIBERATION, because samādhi causes discernment to be born free from turbidity and confusion.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a21_12']	有說此定持勝遍緣，如理思惟故名靜慮。	有說此定持勝遍緣，如理思惟故名靜慮。	There is an opinion that this samādhi is called LIBERATION because it holds the superior and universal contemplation of objects in accordance with reality.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a22_16']	勝言簡欲界遍緣、簡無色如理思惟、簡異顛倒能持。	勝言簡欲界遍緣、簡無色如理思惟、簡異顛倒能持。	The word superior excludes the desire realm, universal excludes the formless realm, and contemplation in accordance with reality excludes the distorted. It is able to hold.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a23_12']	此定是妙等持，此妙等持名為靜慮。	此定是妙等持，此妙等持名為靜慮。	This samādhi is a wondrous samādhi, and this wondrous samādhi is called dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a24_11']	此言顯示止觀均行，無倒等持方名靜慮。	此言顯示止觀均行，無倒等持方名靜慮。	This statement shows that the practice of śamatha and vipaśyanā in equal measure, and the samādhi that is free from error, is called dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a25_1']	若爾，染污寧得此名？	若爾，染污寧得此名？	If that is so, how can the defiled [samādhi] obtain this name?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a26_17']	由彼亦能邪審慮故，於相似處亦立此名，如世間言朽敗種等，故無一切名靜慮失。	由彼亦能邪審慮故，於相似處亦立此名，如世間言朽敗種等，故無一切名靜慮失。	Because it can also wrongly investigate, it is given this name in a similar case. It is like the worldly saying rotten seeds, etc. Therefore there is no error in calling all [samādhis] dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a28_6']	若善性攝心一境性，并伴立為四靜慮者，依何相立初二三四？	若善性攝心一境性，并伴立為四靜慮者，依何相立初二三四？	If the one-pointedness of mind that is of the nature of wholesome [dharmas] and its accompaniments are established as the four dhyānas, on what characteristics are the first, second, third, and fourth [dhyānas] established?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964a28_16']	具伺喜樂，建立為初。	具伺喜樂，建立為初。	[The first dhyāna] is established as being endowed with investigation, joy, and pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b01_4']	謂若位中善一境性，具與尋伺喜樂相應，如是等持名初靜慮。	謂若位中善一境性，具與尋伺喜樂相應，如是等持名初靜慮。	That is to say, in that state, the one-pointedness of mind that is wholesome is endowed with investigation, discursive thought, joy, and pleasure. Such a samādhi is called the first dhyāna.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b02_3']	頌中但說與伺相應，已顯與尋亦相應義。	頌中但說與伺相應，已顯與尋亦相應義。	In the verse, it only says it is endowed with investigation, but it has already shown that it is also endowed with discursive thought.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b03_2']	以若有伺與喜樂俱，必無與尋不相應故。	以若有伺與喜樂俱，必無與尋不相應故。	Because if it has investigation and is accompanied by joy and pleasure, it must also be accompanied by discursive thought.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b04_1']	為顯第二除伺建立，故頌但說具伺非尋。	為顯第二除伺建立，故頌但說具伺非尋。	In order to show the second division, which is established by excluding applied thought, the verse only says that it is associated with sustained thought but not with applied thought.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b04_19']	異此應言具尋喜樂，舉尋有伺不說自成。	異此應言具尋喜樂，舉尋有伺不說自成。	If it were otherwise, it should say that it is associated with applied thought, joy, and pleasure. The existence of applied thought and sustained thought is self-evident.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b06_16']	漸離前支立二三四，離伺有二，離二有樂，具離三種如其次第，故一境性分為四種。	漸離前支立二三四，離伺有二，離二有樂，具離三種如其次第，故一境性分為四種。	The second and third divisions are established by gradually eliminating the first two branches. The second division is associated with sustained thought but not with applied thought. The third division is associated with joy and pleasure but not with sustained thought. The fourth division is completely devoid of the first three. Thus one-pointedness of mind is divided into four kinds.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b07_2']	已辯靜慮。	已辯靜慮。	The dhyānas have been discussed.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b07_7']	無色云何？	無色云何？	What are the formless realms?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b07_10']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse states:
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b08_0']	無色亦如是，　　四蘊離下地，	無色亦如是，　　四蘊離下地，	The formless realms are also like this, with four aggregates, free from the lower realms,
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b09_13']	并上三近分，　　總名除色想。	并上三近分，　　總名除色想。	And the three upper preliminary concentrations, collectively called the elimination of the notion of form.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b10_13']	無色謂無色，　　後色起從心；	無色謂無色，　　後色起從心；	The formless realms are called formless because they lack form, and form arises from the mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b11_13']	空無邊等三，　　名從加行立；	空無邊等三，　　名從加行立；	The three formless realms beginning with infinite space are named according to their preparatory practices.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b12_13']	非想非非想，　　昧劣故立名。	非想非非想，　　昧劣故立名。	The name of neither perception nor non-perception is established because it is dull and inferior.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b13_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b13_16']	此與靜慮數自性同，謂四各二。	此與靜慮數自性同，謂四各二。	The formless realms are the same in number as the dhyānas, with four each having two kinds.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b14_11']	生如前說，即世品說，由生有四。	生如前說，即世品說，由生有四。	Birth is as explained above, that is, in the chapter on the world, where it is said that there are four kinds of birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b15_10']	定無色體，總而言之，亦善性攝心一境性。	定無色體，總而言之，亦善性攝心一境性。	The substance of the formless concentrations is, in general, also the one-pointedness of mind that is good in nature.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b15_20']	依此故說，亦如是言。	依此故說，亦如是言。	On the basis of this, the text says, “It is the same.”
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b16_17']	然助伴中此除色蘊，無色無有隨轉色故。	然助伴中此除色蘊，無色無有隨轉色故。	However, in the group of accompanying dharmas, form is excluded, because there is no derivative form in the formless realms.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b19_11']	雖一境性并伴無差，離下地生故分四種，謂若已離第四靜慮生立空無邊處，乃至已離無所有處生立非想非非想處。	雖一境性并伴無差，離下地生故分四種，謂若已離第四靜慮生立空無邊處，乃至已離無所有處生立非想非非想處。	Although one-pointedness of mind and its accompanying dharmas are not different, they are divided into four kinds because one is born in the upper stages and is separated from the lower stages. That is, the concentration of the sphere of infinite space is established when one is separated from birth in the fourth trance state, and so on, up to the concentration of neither conceptualization nor nonconceptualization, which is established when one is separated from birth in the sphere of nothingness.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b19_16']	離名何義？	離名何義？	What is the meaning of the term separation ?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b20_13']	謂由此道解脫下地惑，是離下染義。	謂由此道解脫下地惑，是離下染義。	It means that by this path one is liberated from the passions of the lower stage. This is the meaning of separation from the impurity of the lower stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b21_14']	即此四根本，并上三近分，總說名為除去色想。	即此四根本，并上三近分，總說名為除去色想。	These four fundamental concentrations and the three intermediate concentrations are generally referred to as the elimination of the notion of form.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b23_5']	空處近分未得此名，緣下地色起色想故，非緣下色想可立除色名。	空處近分未得此名，緣下地色起色想故，非緣下色想可立除色名。	The preliminary concentration of the sphere of infinite space has not yet attained this name, because it generates the notion of form of the lower stage. The name elimination of the notion of form cannot be established on the basis of the notion of form of the lower stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b24_4']	若爾，何緣大種蘊說除去色想是第四定？	若爾，何緣大種蘊說除去色想是第四定？	If this is so, why does the Abhidharmasamuccaya say that the removal of the notion of form is the fourth trance state?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b25_12']	彼緣欲界住自身中所有諸色漸除去故，非無色界可有此想。	彼緣欲界住自身中所有諸色漸除去故，非無色界可有此想。	It is because one gradually removes the notion of form that exists in one’s own body in the desire realm. This notion cannot exist in the formless realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b26_11']	是除色想前加行故，立根本名亦無有失。	是除色想前加行故，立根本名亦無有失。	It is also not a mistake to call the fundamental trance state the removal of the notion of form, because it is the preliminary practice for the removal of the notion of form.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b27_2']	依何義故立無色名？	依何義故立無色名？	In virtue of what meaning is the name formless received?
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b27_11']	依彼都無一切色義。	依彼都無一切色義。	It is because there is absolutely no form in virtue of that.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b28_10']	後歿生下，色從心生，現見世間色非色法。	後歿生下，色從心生，現見世間色非色法。	When one dies in the formless realm and is reborn in a lower realm, form is born from mind. We see in the world that non-form is born from form.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964b29_17']	亦有展轉相依起故，謂心異故色差別生，色根有別識生便異。	亦有展轉相依起故，謂心異故色差別生，色根有別識生便異。	There is also a mutual dependence of form and non-form, because when mind is different, differences in form are born, and when the sense organs are different, consciousness is born differently.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964c02_6']	故從無色將生下時，順色生心相續而住，由彼勢力引下色生。	故從無色將生下時，順色生心相續而住，由彼勢力引下色生。	Therefore, when one is about to be born in a lower realm from the formless realm, a mental series that is favorable to the birth of form exists, and by the power of that, form is attracted and born in a lower realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964c02_15']	然不可言唯從彼起。	然不可言唯從彼起。	However, it cannot be said that it is born from that alone.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964c04_12']	亦以先世色俱行心相續為緣，久已滅色為自種子，今色方起，許同類因通過現故。	亦以先世色俱行心相續為緣，久已滅色為自種子，今色方起，許同類因通過現故。	Also, the mind associated with form in a previous life is the condition for the subsequent mind, and the form that has long since ceased is the seed of the present form. It is admitted that homogeneous causes extend to the past and present.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964c06_8']	諸阿羅漢般涅槃已，諸蘊相續無餘斷故，現無少分諸蘊生緣，不可例同從無色歿。	諸阿羅漢般涅槃已，諸蘊相續無餘斷故，現無少分諸蘊生緣，不可例同從無色歿。	When arhats enter parinirvāṇa, the continuity of their aggregates is completely severed. Therefore, there is no present condition for the arising of any part of the aggregates. This cannot be compared to the case of death from the formless realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_038:0964c06_17']	如是已釋無色總名。	如是已釋無色總名。	This is the explanation of the general name for the formless realm.

It is not so in the other stages, and therefore mindfulness is not established in them.

In the fourth trance state, the two equanimities obscure the functioning of discernment, which accords with ignorance, and consequently the functioning of discernment is not increased. Consequently, discernment is only established in three of the trance states, while mindfulness is established in the two higher ones.

If there is no investigation and discernment, then there is no disgust with the faults of one’s own stage and seeking of the virtues of the higher stage.

Even though one investigates and is disgusted, it is not considered extraordinary. Therefore the other three stages do not establish members of discernment.

Therefore it is established as a member, but the discernment of the higher stages is not like this.

Therefore only the third trance establishes wisdom as a member.

It is able to assist samādhi and cause it to attract superior qualities. Because it has a superior function, it is established as a member.

In the latter two trance states, the function of equanimity increases and overshadows the faculty of faith, so there is no internal purity.
