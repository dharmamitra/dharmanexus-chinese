['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a06_9']	初來意者，總有五義：	初來意者，總有五義：	024	First, the reason for coming has five meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a07_4']	一為答前第二會初十藏問故；	一為答前第二會初十藏問故；	024	First, to answer the question of the ten treasuries at the beginning of the second assembly;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a08_5']	二前明正位，今依位起行故，同〈梵行品〉；	二前明正位，今依位起行故，同〈梵行品〉；	024	Second, the previous chapter clarified the correct position, and now it relies on the position to initiate practice, the same as the chapter on pure conduct;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a08_20']	三前約位別行，今辨始終通行故；	三前約位別行，今辨始終通行故；	024	Third, the previous chapter discusses the separate practices based on the positions, and now it clarifies the practices that run through the beginning and end;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a10_5']	四前明成位行，今辨淨治彼行故，同〈十地〉中信等十行；	四前明成位行，今辨淨治彼行故，同〈十地〉中信等十行；	024	Fourth, the previous chapter clarifies the practices that accomplish the positions, and now it clarifies the purification of those practices, the same as the ten practices of faith and so forth in the ten grounds;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a11_8']	五前明自分究竟，今辨勝進趣後，同上〈明法〉。	五前明自分究竟，今辨勝進趣後，同上〈明法〉。	024	Fifth, the previous chapter clarifies the ultimate of one's own benefit, and now it clarifies the superior progress towards the next, the same as the chapter on clarifying the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a12_6']	準問應在十迴向後，今此辨者，略有二義。	準問應在十迴向後，今此辨者，略有二義。	024	According to the question, it should be after the ten dedications, but now it is discussed here for two reasons.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a12_9']	一云：	一云：	024	First, it is said:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a14_3']	藏有二義，約蘊攝義在十行後、約出生義在十地前，義通二處，問答互顯。	藏有二義，約蘊攝義在十行後、約出生義在十地前，義通二處，問答互顯。	024	There are two meanings of storehouse. In terms of the meaning of subsuming the aggregates, it is after the ten practices; in terms of the meaning of giving rise [to the practices], it is before the ten grounds. The meaning is common to both places, with the questions and answers mutually illuminating.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a14_6']	一云：	一云：	024	One says:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a15_5']	迴向無別自體，但以能迴前行為其自體。	迴向無別自體，但以能迴前行為其自體。	024	The perfections have no separate self-nature, but rather take the previous practices that are able to turn [toward enlightenment] as their self-nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a17_5']	今十藏既為十行勝進，亦為迴向勝進，故迴向後無別勝進，此即前後互舉顯義方備。	今十藏既為十行勝進，亦為迴向勝進，故迴向後無別勝進，此即前後互舉顯義方備。	024	Now, since the ten stores are the superior progress for the ten practices, they are also the superior progress for the perfections. Therefore, after the perfections there is no separate superior progress. This is mutually bringing up the earlier and later to manifest the meaning in all its completeness.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a18_11']	然〈明法品〉及第五迴向皆有十藏，隨三賢異，故不相濫。	然〈明法品〉及第五迴向皆有十藏，隨三賢異，故不相濫。	024	Moreover, the chapter on illuminating the Dharma and the fifth perfection both have ten stores, following the differences in the three sagely ones, thus not overlapping.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a19_18']	又前是勝進所成，後是一位之果，今通為勝進，故意旨不同。	又前是勝進所成，後是一位之果，今通為勝進，故意旨不同。	024	Furthermore, the former is what is accomplished through superior progress, while the latter is the fruition of a single stage. Now, it is common to superior progress, thus the intentions are not the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a21_3']	二釋名者，藏是出生蘊積之義，謂一藏內體含法界故。	二釋名者，藏是出生蘊積之義，謂一藏內體含法界故。	024	As for the second, explaining the names, storehouse means the meaning of giving rise to and accumulating. It refers to the fact that within a single storehouse, the essence contains the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a22_5']	攝德出用一一無盡，寄圓顯十，即帶數釋也。	攝德出用一一無盡，寄圓顯十，即帶數釋也。	024	Subsuming virtues and giving rise to functions, each and every one is inexhaustible. Relying on the perfect to manifest the ten, it is thus a compound word.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a23_6']	三宗趣者，十藏為宗，攝前生後得果為趣。	三宗趣者，十藏為宗，攝前生後得果為趣。	024	As for the third, the main purport, the ten treasuries are the main purport, and subsuming the past and producing the future results is the purport.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a23_15']	四釋文中大分四別：	四釋文中大分四別：	024	As for the fourth, the explanation of the text, it is divided into four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a25_3']	第一唱數顯同、二徵名列異、三依名廣釋、四總歎勝能。	第一唱數顯同、二徵名列異、三依名廣釋、四總歎勝能。	024	First, chanting the number and showing the same; second, questioning the name and listing the differences; third, extensively explaining based on the name; fourth, comprehensively praising the superior abilities.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a25_16']	今初，三世同說，顯勝令遵。	今初，三世同說，顯勝令遵。	024	Now, first, the three periods of time speak the same, showing the superior and causing people to follow.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a26_5']	二「何等」下徵名列異。	二「何等」下徵名列異。	024	Second, below what are, questioning the name and listing the differences.

['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a27_1']	信等對藏，皆持業釋。	信等對藏，皆持業釋。	024	Faith and so forth correspond to the treasuries, all of which are explained by holding the occupation.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a27_11']	心淨名信，制止名戒。	心淨名信，制止名戒。	024	Purity of mind is called faith, and restraint is called morality.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a28_5']	崇重賢善為慚，輕拒暴惡為愧。	崇重賢善為慚，輕拒暴惡為愧。	024	Respecting the virtuous is shame, and despising the violent is modesty.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a29_2']	餐教廣轉為聞，輟己惠人為施。	餐教廣轉為聞，輟己惠人為施。	024	Broadly turning by consuming the teachings is hearing, and ceasing one's own giving is giving.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674a29_16']	決擇諸法名慧，令心明記為念。	決擇諸法名慧，令心明記為念。	024	Resolving and discerning all dharmas is called wisdom, and causing the mind to clearly remember is mindfulness.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b01_12']	任持所記為持，巧宣所持為辯。	任持所記為持，巧宣所持為辯。	024	Sustaining what is remembered is upholding, and skillfully proclaiming what is upheld is eloquence.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b01_17']	各有業用。	各有業用。	024	Each has its own occupation and function.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b03_3']	然念慧及信慚愧等五皆當體為性，餘五行用立名。	然念慧及信慚愧等五皆當體為性，餘五行用立名。	024	However, mindfulness, wisdom, faith, shame, modesty, and so forth, these five all take their own essence as their nature, while the other five lines are established by their functions.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b03_8']	此約隨相。	此約隨相。	024	This is based on their distinct characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b04_15']	若就融通，皆順法界之行，良以法界性自清淨離過等故。	若就融通，皆順法界之行，良以法界性自清淨離過等故。	024	If we discuss their mutual inclusion, all are practices in accord with the Dharma realm, because the nature of the Dharma realm is intrinsically pure, free from faults, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b05_17']	隨義說十，然約隨相，前九自利、後一利他；	隨義說十，然約隨相，前九自利、後一利他；	024	The ten are discussed according to their meanings. However, based on their distinct characteristics, the first nine are for one's own benefit, while the last one is for benefiting others;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b06_11']	通皆具二，信為行本故首明之。	通皆具二，信為行本故首明之。	024	in general, all ten are both for one's own benefit and for benefiting others. Faith is the root of practice, so it is explained first.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b07_14']	依信離過，慚愧莊嚴戒行光潔，上三離過之行。	依信離過，慚愧莊嚴戒行光潔，上三離過之行。	024	Based on faith, one is free from faults. With the adornments of conscience and humility, one's precepts and practices are radiant and pure. The first three are practices of freedom from faults.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b09_15']	餘皆進善，進善之首必藉多聞，如聞而行唯福與慧，念使增明，持令經久，辯以利他故。	餘皆進善，進善之首必藉多聞，如聞而行唯福與慧，念使增明，持令經久，辯以利他故。	024	The rest all progress toward goodness. The foremost of progressing toward goodness is necessarily based on much learning. Practicing according to what one has heard, one has only merit and wisdom. Mindfulness causes them to increase and become bright. Upholding them for a long time, one uses eloquence to benefit others.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b10_13']	前七即七聖財，慧為正導，故終辨之；	前七即七聖財，慧為正導，故終辨之；	024	The first seven are the seven kinds of spiritual wealth. Wisdom is the correct guide, so it is explained last.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b10_18']	次二守護；	次二守護；	024	The next two protect.

['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b12_1']	第三依名廣釋，十藏即為十段。	第三依名廣釋，十藏即為十段。	024	The third, extensively explaining based on the names, has ten sections corresponding to the ten treasuries.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b12_19']	信中有四，謂徵名、釋相、結名、辨益。	信中有四，謂徵名、釋相、結名、辨益。	024	Faith has four parts: asking about the name, explaining the characteristics, concluding the name, and clarifying the benefits.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b13_15']	辨益一種唯初七十，餘之七段文但有三。	辨益一種唯初七十，餘之七段文但有三。	024	The one kind of benefit is only in the first seventy, the remaining seven sections only have three.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b14_6']	今初段中，初徵可知。	今初段中，初徵可知。	024	Now, in the first section, the initial citation is understandable.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b14_11']	釋中分三：	釋中分三：	024	The explanation is divided into three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b15_20']	初明信相、次「若菩薩」下明信力、三「此菩薩入佛」下總結信成。	初明信相、次「若菩薩」下明信力、三「此菩薩入佛」下總結信成。	024	The first clarifies the characteristics of faith, the next is the power of faith below If a bodhisattva, and the third concludes the accomplishment of faith below This bodhisattva enters the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b16_7']	今初也，十句為四：	今初也，十句為四：	024	Now, the first also has ten phrases in four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b18_2']	初三三空，信所執無相，謂情有理無名空，空亦無相，空無相故無所願求。	初三三空，信所執無相，謂情有理無名空，空亦無相，空無相故無所願求。	024	The first three are the three emptinesses. Faith in the absence of characteristics of what is grasped means that emotionally there is, but rationally there is not, which is called emptiness. Emptiness is also without characteristics. Because emptiness is without characteristics, there is nothing to be wished for or sought.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b19_14']	次三信依他無生，一緣起無作、二不實故無能所分別、三無體故無所依。	次三信依他無生，一緣起無作、二不實故無能所分別、三無體故無所依。	024	The next three believe that the other-dependent is without arising. The first is that dependent origination is without action. The second is that because it is not real, there is no subject or object of discrimination. The third is that because it has no substance, there is no basis.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b21_2']	次三信圓成無性，一廣無邊量、二勝故無上、三深不可越。	次三信圓成無性，一廣無邊量、二勝故無上、三深不可越。	024	The next three believe that the perfected is without nature. The first is vast and boundless. The second is superior, therefore unsurpassed. The third is profound and cannot be surpassed.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b21_11']	後一總信三性無生。	後一總信三性無生。	024	The last one generally believes that the three natures are without arising.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b22_7']	如初會辨，則十皆無生並通三性。	如初會辨，則十皆無生並通三性。	024	As explained in the first assembly, the ten are all without arising and are common to the three natures.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b23_17']	如一無生觀，但信依他，無遍計人法自然之生性，則是無性圓成。	如一無生觀，但信依他，無遍計人法自然之生性，則是無性圓成。	024	Like the single contemplation of non-arising, simply believing in the dependent nature, without the nature of the imagined person and dharmas naturally arising, is the naturelessness of the perfected.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b24_3']	餘例此知。	餘例此知。	024	The rest can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b24_12']	第二明信力，中二：	第二明信力，中二：	024	Second, clarifying the power of faith, there are two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b25_4']	先正顯業用、後徵釋所由。	先正顯業用、後徵釋所由。	024	First, directly revealing its function; second, explaining the reason.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b26_4']	今初文有十句，遍從前十，前十並成此十。	今初文有十句，遍從前十，前十並成此十。	024	Now, the text has ten sentences, all of which are completed by the previous ten.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b26_18']	若類例辨，初二於勝上法不怯；	若類例辨，初二於勝上法不怯；	024	If classified and explained, the first two are not timid about superior and excellent dharmas;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b28_10']	次四廣多法不怯，一所化眾生、二即化法、三是化處、四化之所歸；	次四廣多法不怯，一所化眾生、二即化法、三是化處、四化之所歸；	024	Next, the four are not timid about extensive and numerous dharmas, one is the sentient beings to be transformed, two are the methods of transformation, three are the places of transformation, and four are the goal of transformation;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674b28_18']	後四寬遠法不怯。	後四寬遠法不怯。	024	The last four are not timid about vast and distant dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c05_17']	若剋文取義，以後十句逆配前十，謂由信法無生故，於佛法不怯，佛法以無生為體故、佛難超故、眾生無盡故、法界無邊故、虛空無依故、涅槃無分別故、過去之因不作果故、未來之法無可願故、現在之法即無相故、入劫無障礙以即空故，此十皆深廣難思。	若剋文取義，以後十句逆配前十，謂由信法無生故，於佛法不怯，佛法以無生為體故、佛難超故、眾生無盡故、法界無邊故、虛空無依故、涅槃無分別故、過去之因不作果故、未來之法無可願故、現在之法即無相故、入劫無障礙以即空故，此十皆深廣難思。	024	If one takes the meaning according to the text, the latter ten phrases are reversed to match the former ten. That is to say, because of the non-arising of faith in the Dharma, one is not timid about the Buddha's teachings. Because the Buddha's teachings take non-arising as their essence, because the Buddha is difficult to surpass, because sentient beings are inexhaustible, because the Dharma realm is boundless, because space is without support, because nirvana is without discrimination, because past causes do not produce results, because future dharmas are nothing to be wished for, because present dharmas are precisely without characteristics, and because entering the kalpas is unobstructed, since they are empty. These ten are all profound, vast, and difficult to conceive.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c06_9']	二徵釋中，先徵意云：	二徵釋中，先徵意云：	024	In the second part, the questioning and explanation, the questioning means asking why.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c07_3']	何以深廣難思，菩薩聞而不怯？	何以深廣難思，菩薩聞而不怯？	024	Why is it profound, vast, and difficult to conceive, yet bodhisattvas hear it without timidity?
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c07_7']	釋意云：	釋意云：	024	The explanation means that
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c07_16']	以於深廣皆堅信故。	以於深廣皆堅信故。	024	it is because they firmly believe in the profound and vast.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c08_2']	文分為二：	文分為二：	024	The text is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c08_8']	初總、後別。	初總、後別。	024	first, a general statement; then, a specific explanation.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c08_20']	總云一向信者，無猶豫故。	總云一向信者，無猶豫故。	024	The general statement says single-mindedly believing because there is no doubt.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c09_8']	堅者，異說不壞故。	堅者，異說不壞故。	024	Firm means not being destroyed by different explanations.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c09_13']	所信謂何？	所信謂何？	024	What is it that is believed in?
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c09_18']	即佛智慧。	即佛智慧。	024	It is the wisdom of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c10_2']	智慧何相？	智慧何相？	024	What are the characteristics of wisdom?
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c10_7']	無邊無盡。	無邊無盡。	024	It is boundless and inexhaustible.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c10_12']	然通二義：	然通二義：	024	However, it has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c11_2']	一廣無邊涯，豎不可盡；	一廣無邊涯，豎不可盡；	024	First, it is vast and boundless, and cannot be exhausted vertically;
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c11_16']	二無二邊之偏，同真性之無盡。	二無二邊之偏，同真性之無盡。	024	Second, it is free from the bias of the two extremes, and is inexhaustible like the true nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c12_5']	二「十方」下別釋。	二「十方」下別釋。	024	Second, the specific explanation below.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c14_6']	初釋前意，十方無量是無邊義，已現當入是無盡義，言得菩提是自證義，出世入滅是應現義。	初釋前意，十方無量是無邊義，已現當入是無盡義，言得菩提是自證義，出世入滅是應現義。	024	First, explaining the previous meaning, the immeasurable ten directions is the meaning of boundlessness, and the present and future entry is the meaning of inexhaustibility. The statement of attaining enlightenment is the meaning of self-realization, and leaving the world and entering extinction is the meaning of responding and manifesting.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c14_16']	法無邊故，佛智無邊。	法無邊故，佛智無邊。	024	Because the Dharma is boundless, the Buddha's wisdom is boundless.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c15_16']	一佛之智尚不可盡，況橫遍十方、豎該三際。	一佛之智尚不可盡，況橫遍十方、豎該三際。	024	The wisdom of one Buddha is still inexhaustible, let alone pervading the ten directions horizontally and encompassing the three periods of time vertically.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c16_13']	菩薩於斯廣遠堅信不移，寧有怯耶？	菩薩於斯廣遠堅信不移，寧有怯耶？	024	The bodhisattvas have firm faith in this vast and distant [wisdom] without wavering. How could there be fear?
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c17_9']	二「彼諸」下釋第二意，聞深不怯。	二「彼諸」下釋第二意，聞深不怯。	024	Second, explaining the second meaning of not being afraid of hearing the profound below.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c18_9']	謂已得今得菩提而不增，當得未得而不減。	謂已得今得菩提而不增，當得未得而不減。	024	It means that one does not increase by attaining enlightenment in the present or future, and does not decrease by not attaining it in the past.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c19_6', 'ZH_T35_1735_024:0674c19_18']	已出今出而不生，已入今入而不滅。🔽當出而不進，當入而不退。	已出今出而不生，已入今入而不滅。 當出而不進，當入而不退。	024	Already emerged and emerging now, yet not born; already entered and entering now, yet not extinguished.🔽To emerge yet not advance, to enter yet not retreat.

['ZH_T35_1735_024:0676a17_11']	二與名色作緣，謂由識入母胎，名色得增長。	二與名色作緣，謂由識入母胎，名色得增長。	024	the second is that of acting as a condition for name-and-form, that is, because consciousness enters the mother’s womb, name-and-form is able to grow.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0676a19_10']	今言識無者，即不為業熏、不持業縛，故不入胎增長名色，故云識無故名色無。	今言識無者，即不為業熏、不持業縛，故不入胎增長名色，故云識無故名色無。	024	Now, when it is said that consciousness does not exist, it is because it is not perfumed by karma and does not hold the bonds of karma, and therefore it does not enter the womb and cause name-and-form to grow. Therefore it says, “Because of the nonexistence of consciousness, there is the nonexistence of name-and-form.”

The world means the meaning of concealment, because it conceals the supreme truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_024:0676b03_15']	又可破壞義，三世所遷故。	又可破壞義，三世所遷故。	024	Moreover, it means that which can be destroyed, because it is moved by the three times.
