['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708a27_2']	儒道二教說人畜等類，皆是虛無大道生成養育。	儒道二教說人畜等類，皆是虛無大道生成養育。	The two teachings of Confucianism and Daoism say that humans, animals, and other species are all created and nurtured by the vast and empty Great Dao.
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708a29_4']	謂道法自然生於元氣，元氣生天地，天地生萬物，故愚智貴賤貧富苦樂，皆稟於天，由於時命；	謂道法自然生於元氣，元氣生天地，天地生萬物，故愚智貴賤貧富苦樂，皆稟於天，由於時命；	They say that the Way naturally gives rise to primordial qi, primordial qi gives rise to heaven and earth, heaven and earth give rise to myriad things, so foolishness and wisdom, nobility and humbleness, poverty and wealth, suffering and joy, are all bestowed by heaven and due to one's allotted lifespan;
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708a29_17']	故死後却歸天地，復其虛無。	故死後却歸天地，復其虛無。	Therefore, after death, one returns to heaven and earth and reverts to emptiness.

['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b04_4']	所說萬物不論象外，雖指大道為本，而不備明順逆起滅染淨因緣，故習者不知是權，執之為了。	所說萬物不論象外，雖指大道為本，而不備明順逆起滅染淨因緣，故習者不知是權，執之為了。	What they say about myriad things does not discuss what is beyond phenomena. Although they point to the Great Dao as the basis, they do not fully clarify the causes and conditions of the arising and ceasing of conformity and transgression, defilement and purity, so those who practice it do not know it is provisional, but grasp it as ultimate.
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b04_11']	今略舉而詰之。	今略舉而詰之。	Now I will briefly bring it up and question it.
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b06_5']	所言萬物皆從虛無大道而生者，大道即是生死賢愚之本，吉凶禍福之基。	所言萬物皆從虛無大道而生者，大道即是生死賢愚之本，吉凶禍福之基。	As for the statement that all things are born from the Great Dao of nothingness, the Great Dao is precisely the root of life and death, the wise and the foolish, the foundation of good and bad fortune, and misfortune.
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b08_1']	基本既其常存，則禍亂凶愚不可除也，福慶賢善不可益也，何用老莊之教耶？	基本既其常存，則禍亂凶愚不可除也，福慶賢善不可益也，何用老莊之教耶？	Since the foundation is always present, misfortune, chaos, bad fortune, and foolishness cannot be eliminated, and blessings, good fortune, the wise, and the virtuous cannot be increased. What is the use of the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi then?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b09_2']	又道育虎狼、胎桀紂，夭顏冉、禍夷齊，何名尊乎？	又道育虎狼、胎桀紂，夭顏冉、禍夷齊，何名尊乎？	Moreover, the Dao nurtures tigers and wolves, gives birth to Jie and Zhou, shortens the lives of Yan Hui and Ran Qiu, and brings misfortune to the people of Yizhi and Qi. How can it be called honorable?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b11_7']	又言萬物皆是自然生化非因緣者，則一切無因緣處悉應生化，謂石應生草，草或生人，人生畜等。	又言萬物皆是自然生化非因緣者，則一切無因緣處悉應生化，謂石應生草，草或生人，人生畜等。	Moreover, if it is said that all things are born and transformed naturally, not by causes and conditions, then everything that is not caused by conditions should give rise to transformation. That is to say, stones should give rise to grass, grass may give rise to humans, humans give birth to animals, and so on.
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b13_12']	又應生無前後，起無早晚，神仙不藉丹藥，太平不藉賢良，仁義不藉教習，老莊周孔何用立教為軌則乎？	又應生無前後，起無早晚，神仙不藉丹藥，太平不藉賢良，仁義不藉教習，老莊周孔何用立教為軌則乎？	Moreover, there should be no sequence in birth, no early or late arising. Immortals would not rely on elixirs and medicines, a peaceful world would not depend on the virtuous and capable, kindness and righteousness would not depend on teaching and practice. What is the use of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Confucius, and the Duke of Zhou establishing teachings and rules?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b15_8']	又言皆從元氣而生成者，則歘生之神未曾習慮，豈得嬰孩便能愛惡驕恣焉？	又言皆從元氣而生成者，則歘生之神未曾習慮，豈得嬰孩便能愛惡驕恣焉？	Moreover, if it is said that all come from the primordial qi to be born, then the spirit that suddenly appears has never experienced thought. How can an infant be able to love, hate, be arrogant, and indulgent?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b17_7']	若言歘有自然便能隨念愛惡等者，則五德六藝悉能隨念而解，何待因緣學習而成？	若言歘有自然便能隨念愛惡等者，則五德六藝悉能隨念而解，何待因緣學習而成？	If it is said that there is a sudden natural ability to follow thoughts and love, hate, etc., then the five virtues and six arts can all be understood by following thoughts. Why wait for causes and conditions to learn and accomplish them?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b18_13']	又若生是稟氣而歘有，死是氣散而歘無，則誰為鬼神乎？	又若生是稟氣而歘有，死是氣散而歘無，則誰為鬼神乎？	Moreover, if birth is receiving qi and suddenly existing, and death is the dispersal of qi and suddenly ceasing to exist, then who becomes ghosts and spirits?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b20_2']	且世有鑒達前生追憶往事，則知生前相續，非稟氣而歘有；	且世有鑒達前生追憶往事，則知生前相續，非稟氣而歘有；	Furthermore, there are those in the world who clearly remember their past lives and recall past events. This shows that there is continuity before birth, not suddenly existing by receiving qi;
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b21_3']	又驗鬼神靈知不斷，則知死後非氣散而歘無。	又驗鬼神靈知不斷，則知死後非氣散而歘無。	Moreover, by verifying that the spiritual knowledge of ghosts and spirits is uninterrupted, it is known that after death, it is not suddenly ceasing to exist by the dispersal of qi.
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b23_4']	故祭祀求禱，典藉有文，況死而蘇者說幽途事，或死後感動妻子讎報怨恩，今古皆有耶？	故祭祀求禱，典藉有文，況死而蘇者說幽途事，或死後感動妻子讎報怨恩，今古皆有耶？	Therefore, there are texts in the classics about making sacrifices and praying. Moreover, those who have died and come back to life speak of the affairs of the netherworld. Some have died and then moved their wives and children to repay grudges and favors. There have been such cases in the past and present.

['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b27_10']	」且天地之氣本無知也，人稟無知之氣，安得歘起而有知乎？	」且天地之氣本無知也，人稟無知之氣，安得歘起而有知乎？	Moreover, the qi of heaven and earth is originally without consciousness. How can a person who receives qi without consciousness suddenly give rise to consciousness?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708b28_3']	草木亦皆稟氣，何不知乎？	草木亦皆稟氣，何不知乎？	Grasses and trees also receive qi, so why are they not conscious?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c01_10']	又言貧富貴賤賢愚善惡吉凶禍福皆由天命者，則天之賦命奚有貧多富少、賤多貴少，乃至禍多福少？	又言貧富貴賤賢愚善惡吉凶禍福皆由天命者，則天之賦命奚有貧多富少、賤多貴少，乃至禍多福少？	Furthermore, those who say that poverty and wealth, nobility and humbleness, wisdom and foolishness, goodness and evil, good and bad fortune are all due to heaven's mandate, then why does heaven's bestowal of life have more poor people and fewer rich people, more humble people and fewer noble people, and so on, up to more bad fortune and fewer good fortunes?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c02_5']	苟多少之分在天，天何不平乎？	苟多少之分在天，天何不平乎？	If the distribution of more or less is in heaven, why is heaven not impartial?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c04_8']	況有無行而貴、守行而賤，無德而富、有德而貧，逆吉義凶、仁夭暴壽，乃至有道者喪、無道者興？	況有無行而貴、守行而賤，無德而富、有德而貧，逆吉義凶、仁夭暴壽，乃至有道者喪、無道者興？	How much more so for valuing the idle and despising the diligent, enriching the immoral and impoverishing the virtuous, rewarding the wicked and punishing the righteous, causing the benevolent to die young and the violent to live long, and even causing those with the Way to perish and those without the Way to prosper?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c05_2']	既皆由天，天乃興不道而喪道？	既皆由天，天乃興不道而喪道？	If all this is due to Heaven, then Heaven promotes the immoral and destroys those with the Way?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c05_19']	何有福善益謙之賞，禍淫害盈之罰焉？	何有福善益謙之賞，禍淫害盈之罰焉？	How can there be rewards for blessings and humility, or punishments for misfortune and harm to the full?
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c07_14']	又既禍亂反逆皆由天命，則聖人設教，責人不責天，罪物不罪命，是不當也！	又既禍亂反逆皆由天命，則聖人設教，責人不責天，罪物不罪命，是不當也！	Moreover, if calamities, chaos, and rebellion are all due to the mandate of Heaven, then the sages' teachings blame people but not Heaven, and punish things but not the mandate. This is not right!
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c09_10']	然則《詩》刺亂政，《書》讚王道，《禮》稱安上，《樂》號移風，豈是奉上天之意，順造化之心乎？	然則《詩》刺亂政，《書》讚王道，《禮》稱安上，《樂》號移風，豈是奉上天之意，順造化之心乎？	Then the Book of Poetry criticizes chaotic governance, the Book of Documents praises the Way of the King, the Book of Rites praises the peace of the people, and the Book of Music is said to transform customs. Are these not the intentions of serving the Supreme Heaven and following the mind of creation?

The Buddha first taught beginners about the karmic retribution of good and evil causes and effects in the three periods of time, saying that those who commit the ten evil deeds of the highest level will fall into hell after death, those of the middle level will become hungry ghosts, and those of the lowest level will become animals.
['ZH_T45_1886_001:0708c18_9']	故佛且類世五常之教天竺世教，儀式雖殊，懲惡勸善無別，亦不離仁義等五常，而有德行可修例。	故佛且類世五常之教天竺世教，儀式雖殊，懲惡勸善無別，亦不離仁義等五常，而有德行可修例。	Therefore, the Buddha classified them according to the five constant virtues of the world, although the worldly teachings of India have different forms, they are no different in discouraging evil and encouraging goodness, and they are also not apart from the five constant virtues such as benevolence and righteousness, and there are virtues and practices that can be cultivated as examples.

The title does not mention heavens, ghosts, or hells, because the realms and stages are different, and ordinary people cannot see or hear them.

Greed is to crave fame and profit in order to glorify the self, anger is to resent unfavorable circumstances for fear of harming the self, and delusion is to engage in irrational calculations and so forth.
