['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860a14_9']	此乃文句相似而義有別，故非重也。	此乃文句相似而義有別，故非重也。	This is because the wording is similar but the meaning is different, so it is not a repetition.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860a17_1']	前段經中答疑四句，初有三句，明法身菩提性淨涅槃，本體圓滿非修得法；	前段經中答疑四句，初有三句，明法身菩提性淨涅槃，本體圓滿非修得法；	In the previous section of the sutra, the four statements that resolve doubts are answered. The first three statements clarify the nature of the Dharma body, the pure nirvāṇa, and the originally perfect and complete non-cultivated dharmas;
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860a18_13']	後一句，明報佛方便涅槃，由修一切善法方便因滿法身有用，是修得法。	後一句，明報佛方便涅槃，由修一切善法方便因滿法身有用，是修得法。	The last statement clarifies the conditioned nirvāṇa of the reward Buddha, which is the function of the Dharma body due to the completion of the causes and conditions of cultivating all wholesome dharmas, which are the cultivated dharmas.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860a23_18']	然此經教音聲之性，證法中無念念生滅，無有習因增長之義，體是無記，非為善法故。	然此經教音聲之性，證法中無念念生滅，無有習因增長之義，體是無記，非為善法故。	However, the nature of this sutra's teachings is sound, and in the realized Dharma there is no arising and ceasing thought after thought, and there is no meaning of increasing through the causes of habituation. Its essence is indeterminate, not good.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860a25_14']	受持經教不能發生三慧之善，不生三慧善故無有因義，既無因義則不證菩提。	受持經教不能發生三慧之善，不生三慧善故無有因義，既無因義則不證菩提。	Therefore, upholding the sutra's teachings cannot give rise to the good of the three wisdoms. Because it does not give rise to the good of the three wisdoms, there is no meaning of cause. Since there is no meaning of cause, one does not realize enlightenment.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860a26_11']	那得道言一切善法得阿耨三菩提也？	那得道言一切善法得阿耨三菩提也？	How can it be said that all good dharmas attain supreme enlightenment?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860a28_17']	故千須彌七寶布施勝福譬喻以答此疑，明此般若一偈經教從證法中來，非是無記而能詮於法身。	故千須彌七寶布施勝福譬喻以答此疑，明此般若一偈經教從證法中來，非是無記而能詮於法身。	Therefore, the simile of the superior merit of giving away the seven treasures of a thousand Mount Sumerus is used to answer this doubt, clarifying that this one verse of the Prajnaparamita Sutra comes from the realized Dharma, and is not indeterminate while being able to expound the Dharma body.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b01_15']	若依經修行因緣，能顯性證果，得大菩提，勝於三千須彌珍寶布施之福不可算數故。	若依經修行因緣，能顯性證果，得大菩提，勝於三千須彌珍寶布施之福不可算數故。	If one practices in accordance with the sutra, the causes and conditions can manifest the nature and realize the fruition, attaining great enlightenment, which surpasses the merit of offering precious treasures equal to Mount Sumeru in the trichiliocosm, which cannot be calculated.

This clarifies that contaminated merit and virtue are exhaustible dharmas, so the number is also limited. It clarifies that uncontaminated wholesome dharmas are inexhaustible dharmas, and the number is also limitless, so they are superior.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b08_11']	「歌羅分不及一」者，論云「力勝」，歌羅者，西國正音，如析一毛以為百分，一分名一歌羅。	「歌羅分不及一」者，論云「力勝」，歌羅者，西國正音，如析一毛以為百分，一分名一歌羅。	One-billionth of a part is not even one-billionth means that the power is superior. Kara is the correct pronunciation in the Western regions, like dividing a single hair into one billion parts, one part is called one kara.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b10_3']	此義憣為力勝，以無漏善法功德勢力勝於有漏善法故，名為力勝也。	此義憣為力勝，以無漏善法功德勢力勝於有漏善法故，名為力勝也。	This meaning is explained as superior in power because the power of the merit of pure good dharmas is superior to that of impure good dharmas, so it is called superior in power.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b12_8']	「數分不及一」者，論云「不相似勝」，猶是其數數中轉微轉細，乃至少許猶不及一故，名不相似勝也。	「數分不及一」者，論云「不相似勝」，猶是其數數中轉微轉細，乃至少許猶不及一故，名不相似勝也。	Not even a fraction of one means that the treatise says superior in dissimilarity, meaning that in the midst of counting, it becomes more and more subtle, down to the smallest amount, which is still not even a fraction of one, so it is called superior in dissimilarity.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b14_16']	明此無漏善法若有形色者，虛空法界所不容受，以有為有盡法形無為無盡法故，假令乃至少許亦不相似。	明此無漏善法若有形色者，虛空法界所不容受，以有為有盡法形無為無盡法故，假令乃至少許亦不相似。	It is explained that if these pure good dharmas had form, they would not be contained in the dharma realm of space, because conditioned dharmas have an end and form does not accord with unconditioned dharmas that are endless. Even if it were a small amount, it would still not be similar.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b17_6']	「優波尼沙陀分」者，論中義憣云「因勝」，明因果不相似。	「優波尼沙陀分」者，論中義憣云「因勝」，明因果不相似。	The fraction of an upa-niṣāda - the treatise explains the meaning as superior in cause, clarifying that cause and effect are dissimilar.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b18_6']	珍寶有漏善法但得三界報，因果俱是不如。	珍寶有漏善法但得三界報，因果俱是不如。	Precious impure good dharmas only attain the retribution of the three realms, and both cause and effect are inferior.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b19_11']	無漏善法乃遠得佛果，因果俱勝故，名因果不相似也。	無漏善法乃遠得佛果，因果俱勝故，名因果不相似也。	Only the pure good dharmas can attain the Buddha-fruit in the end, because the cause and effect are both superior, it is called the cause and effect are not similar.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b24_13']	初一偈，解持經功德勝布施之福，經教是無記非因之疑也。	初一偈，解持經功德勝布施之福，經教是無記非因之疑也。	The first verse explains the merit of upholding the sutra surpassing the blessings of giving, and the doubt that the sutra teaching is a neutral dharma and not a cause.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b25_20']	第二偈，釋四種勝，從「百分不及一」乃至「所不能及也」。	第二偈，釋四種勝，從「百分不及一」乃至「所不能及也」。	The second verse explains the four kinds of superiority, from one hundredth of a part up to what it cannot reach.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b26_13']	前疑言：	前疑言：	The previous doubt says:
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860b28_17']	經教是音聲性無記之法，依此無記法受持修行，則無善、則無因義，何得言以一切善法得三菩提也？	經教是音聲性無記之法，依此無記法受持修行，則無善、則無因義，何得言以一切善法得三菩提也？	The scriptures and teachings are the nature of sound, which is a neutral dharma. Relying on this neutral dharma to uphold and practice will have no goodness and no meaning of cause. How can it be said that attaining supreme enlightenment is done through all good dharmas?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c01_4']	故答云「雖言無記法」，此句順疑者意，故云「雖言無記法」。	故答云「雖言無記法」，此句順疑者意，故云「雖言無記法」。	Therefore, the answer says Although it is said to be a neutral dharma. This sentence follows the meaning of the doubter, so it says Although it is said to be a neutral dharma.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c03_17']	音聲言教雖是無記之法，而能詮於佛性涅槃之理，依而修行發生三慧勝解，能使行者終剋常果，有詮理益初咸果之能。	音聲言教雖是無記之法，而能詮於佛性涅槃之理，依而修行發生三慧勝解，能使行者終剋常果，有詮理益初咸果之能。	Although the spoken teachings are dharmas that are neutral, they are able to expound the principle of buddha-nature and nirvana. Relying on them to practice and generate the three kinds of wisdom and superior understanding can enable practitioners to ultimately attain the eternal fruit, having the ability to expound the principle and benefit the initial attainment of the fruit.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c05_5']	此明言教雖是無記而有因義，故次下句云「而說是彼因」。	此明言教雖是無記而有因義，故次下句云「而說是彼因」。	This clarifies that although the spoken teachings are neutral, they have the meaning of cause, so the next sentence says But it is said to be their cause.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c06_9']	若爾，那得難言以無記故無有因義則無修行得菩提者也？	若爾，那得難言以無記故無有因義則無修行得菩提者也？	If that is so, how can it be questioned that because of being neutral, there is no meaning of cause, and therefore there is no practice and attainment of enlightenment?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c06_16']	此釋上半偈也。	此釋上半偈也。	This explains the first half of the verse.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c08_18']	以此經教從真如證法中來，是其一分，為此真如證法所勳故。	以此經教從真如證法中來，是其一分，為此真如證法所勳故。	Because this sutra teaching comes from the Dharma realized through suchness, it is a part of it, and is perfumed by that Dharma realized through suchness.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c09_11']	言教非是無記，有其因義。	言教非是無記，有其因義。	The teaching is not indeterminate, but has its causes.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c11_4']	如以須摩那華及薝蔔華勳胡麻子，後押得油，名須摩那油及薝蔔油。	如以須摩那華及薝蔔華勳胡麻子，後押得油，名須摩那油及薝蔔油。	It is like perfuming sesame seeds with sumana flowers and karnikara flowers, and later pressing them to obtain the oil, which is called sumana oil and karnikara oil.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c14_15']	此言教亦如是，為證法所勳，非是無記故，受持讀誦此能詮言教，發生聞慧，從聞生思，從思生修，次第修行乃至證得無上菩提，勝於三千須彌七寶施福。	此言教亦如是，為證法所勳，非是無記故，受持讀誦此能詮言教，發生聞慧，從聞生思，從思生修，次第修行乃至證得無上菩提，勝於三千須彌七寶施福。	This teaching is also like this, being perfumed by the realized Dharma, and not being indeterminate, therefore, upholding and reciting this able to expound teaching, gives rise to the wisdom of hearing, from hearing arises thought, from thought arises cultivation, and in sequence practices until realizing supreme enlightenment, surpassing the merit of giving the seven treasures of the three thousand worlds and Mount Sumeru.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c16_1']	以三千須彌七寶有漏施福不能得大菩提，是故不如。	以三千須彌七寶有漏施福不能得大菩提，是故不如。	Because the merit of giving the seven treasures of the three thousand worlds and Mount Sumeru, which is contaminated, cannot attain great enlightenment, therefore it is not as good.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c16_20']	故下半偈言「是故一法寶，勝無量珍寶」。	故下半偈言「是故一法寶，勝無量珍寶」。	Thus, the second half of the verse says: Therefore, one Dharma treasure surpasses innumerable precious treasures.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c17_18']	「一法寶」者，此般若經一行偈名為法寶。	「一法寶」者，此般若經一行偈名為法寶。	One Dharma Jewel refers to a single line of verse from this Prajnaparamita Sutra, which is called a Dharma Jewel.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c19_11']	「是故」者，是故經教非是無記，有其因義故，便勝無量珍寶布施有相之福也。	「是故」者，是故經教非是無記，有其因義故，便勝無量珍寶布施有相之福也。	Therefore means that the sutra teachings are not indeterminate, because they have the meaning of being a cause, and are thus superior to the merit of making offerings of immeasurable precious things with characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c20_5']	「此義云何？	「此義云何？	What does this mean?

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c23_18']	「又言無記者，此義不然者至勝無量珍寶故」，此解下半偈，即舉偈結也。	「又言無記者，此義不然者至勝無量珍寶故」，此解下半偈，即舉偈結也。	Moreover, it is said that the indeterminate meaning is not so... because it is superior to immeasurable precious things, this explains the second half of the verse and concludes with the verse.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c24_14']	此違疑者意，正解經教非是無記法也。	此違疑者意，正解經教非是無記法也。	This contradicts the meaning of the doubter, and correctly explains that the sutra teachings are not indeterminate dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0860c27_13']	「汝法是無記而我法是記」者，汝小乘法中謂聲教為無記，今依我大乘中，明音聲經教從佛法身記法中來故，是記法非是無記。	「汝法是無記而我法是記」者，汝小乘法中謂聲教為無記，今依我大乘中，明音聲經教從佛法身記法中來故，是記法非是無記。	Your Dharma is indeterminate, but my Dharma is determinate means that in your Hīnayāna Dharma, you consider the sound of the teachings to be indeterminate. Now, according to my Mahāyāna, it is explained that the sound of the sūtras and teachings comes from the determinate Dharma of the Buddha's Dharma body, so it is a determinate Dharma, not an indeterminate one.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0861a01_12']	又行者身口意業有所起作，皆有招感之能，亦有順理益物之義，故諸佛說所經教，音聲之性是口業善，能慎理益物非無記也。	又行者身口意業有所起作，皆有招感之能，亦有順理益物之義，故諸佛說所經教，音聲之性是口業善，能慎理益物非無記也。	Moreover, the physical, verbal, and mental actions of the practitioner, whatever they are, all have the ability to attract and respond, and also have the meaning of following the principles and benefiting beings. Therefore, the sūtras and teachings spoken by the Buddhas, the nature of the sounds, are the wholesome actions of the mouth, able to follow the principles and benefit beings, not being indeterminate.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0861a03_7']	「是故此所說法勝彼阿僧祇須彌珍寶故」者，結受持經教福德勝珍寶施福也。	「是故此所說法勝彼阿僧祇須彌珍寶故」者，結受持經教福德勝珍寶施福也。	Therefore, the Dharma that is spoken is superior to the incalculable precious treasures of Mount Sumeru concludes that the merit of upholding the sūtras and teachings is superior to the merit of giving precious treasures.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0861a03_20']	「如經」以下，以經結論也。	「如經」以下，以經結論也。	As in the sūtra and below concludes with the sūtra.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0861a06_19']	然未知釋勝有幾種，故設問，問此百分不及一等此示何義也。	然未知釋勝有幾種，故設問，問此百分不及一等此示何義也。	However, it is still unknown how many kinds of superiority the explanation has, so a question is posed, asking How many hundredths of this is not equal to one? This shows what meaning?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0861a07_15']	即作第二偈，答「數力無似勝」也。	即作第二偈，答「數力無似勝」也。	Then the second verse is composed, answering The superiority of number, power, and uniqueness.

Among all worldly defiled dharmas, there is nothing comparable to it, so it is said that it cannot be used as an analogy.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0861a13_6']	「此說何等義？	「此說何等義？	What meaning does this explain?

The doubtful ones say that sentient beings have no dharma body. This latter half of the verse clarifies that the five aggregates of sentient beings are names within the dharma realm. One should know that they equally have the dharma body, so first explaining the latter half of the verse and then explaining the first half of the verse is because in equality, the Buddha does not liberate sentient beings. From here below explains the first half of the verse.

These three sentences, together with the two sentences below the previous verse, explain the sutra's If there really were beings that the Tathagata saves, then the Tathagata would have the characteristics of self, person, sentient being, and life.

Now, it says If there is saving, then it is a mistake of taking characteristics. This brings up the mistake to clarify the absence of mistake. Therefore, one should know that outside of the Dharma realm there are no separate five aggregates that form illusory sentient beings to be saved by the Tathagata.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0862c02_7']	上雖言「以取彼法是」，未知作何等意取，故第三句云「取度眾生故」。	上雖言「以取彼法是」，未知作何等意取，故第三句云「取度眾生故」。	Although above it says because of grasping those dharmas as, it is not yet known what kind of grasping is done, therefore the third line says because of grasping to deliver sentient beings.

Although the accomplishment of characteristics cannot be seen, the Tathāgata takes the Dharma body as its essence.

Then, one knows that the Dharma body of the Tathāgata is accomplished by the characteristics of blessings. This is the statement that creates difficulties.

How could there be a separate unconditioned Dharma body that has always existed from ancient times, not attained through causes and not seen through characteristics?

Therefore, it is not that the reward Buddha can be seen as the cause by his characteristics. It also causes the ancient and present to be definitely the same in taking the unconditioned Dharma body as the cause that can be seen by characteristics.

Why does it still make a second verse? The above verse, from the perspective of the meaning of specific characteristics, completely clarifies that the physical characteristics are not the Dharma body Buddha. Fearing that sentient beings would completely differentiate the reward body's physical characteristics from the Dharma body, and thus abandon the meaning of the reward Buddha, it makes the following verse.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864a03_9']	「若以色見我，以音聲求我」者，若語當時發聲說偈者，是應佛口業亦道報佛口業；	「若以色見我，以音聲求我」者，若語當時發聲說偈者，是應佛口業亦道報佛口業；	If you see me with form, if you seek me with sound - if speaking of the one who uttered the verse at that time, it is the responsive Buddha's activity of speech, which also expresses the Buddha's activity of speech as retribution;

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864a08_16']	若謂法身同此色聲可見聞者，是不正見，故第三句云「是人行邪道」也。	若謂法身同此色聲可見聞者，是不正見，故第三句云「是人行邪道」也。	If you say that the Dharma-body is the same as form and sound that can be seen and heard, that is a wrong view, so the third line says this person practices the wrong path.

['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864b15_9']	於意云何？	於意云何？	What do you think?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864b17_8']	如來可以相成就得三菩提耶」，此一段經，是斷疑分中第十四段經文，此經已七遍來。	如來可以相成就得三菩提耶」，此一段經，是斷疑分中第十四段經文，此經已七遍來。	Can the Tathāgata attain supreme enlightenment through the perfection of characteristics? This section of the sūtra is the fourteenth section of the text in the part on resolving doubts. This sūtra has appeared seven times.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864b19_4']	所以復來者，上已廣解無為法身古今一定妙有湛然體無諸相，不為修行所得；	所以復來者，上已廣解無為法身古今一定妙有湛然體無諸相，不為修行所得；	The reason for coming again is that above it has extensively explained that the unconditioned Dharma body is eternally abiding, wondrously existent, and profoundly tranquil, and its essence is devoid of all characteristics, and is not attained through cultivation and practice;
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864b20_17']	又次前二段經明法身體自滿足，非修福德業所得相好色聲而可見聞。	又次前二段經明法身體自滿足，非修福德業所得相好色聲而可見聞。	Moreover, the two previous sections of the sutra clarify that the essence of the Dharma body is inherently perfect, and the major and minor marks of merit and virtue that can be seen and heard are not attained through cultivation.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864b24_6']	或者執謂正以菩薩始從發菩提心，三大阿僧祇劫修，十地行滿金剛心謝證種智時，名為報佛，有無量相好者即是法身，故謂法身是修得亦可見聞。	或者執謂正以菩薩始從發菩提心，三大阿僧祇劫修，十地行滿金剛心謝證種智時，名為報佛，有無量相好者即是法身，故謂法身是修得亦可見聞。	Some people grasp and say that it is precisely when the bodhisattva begins to give rise to the bodhi mind, cultivates for three great asamkhyeya kalpas, perfects the practices of the ten grounds, and at the time of the vajra mind realizes the wisdom of the tathāgata, it is called the reward Buddha, and the one with immeasurable major and minor marks is the Dharma body, therefore they say that the Dharma body is attained through cultivation and can be seen and heard.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864b25_15']	今聞別有無為法身不為因得，復不可以色聲見聞，乘生疑難：	今聞別有無為法身不為因得，復不可以色聲見聞，乘生疑難：	Now, hearing that there is separately an unconditioned Dharma body that is not attained through causes, and also cannot be seen and heard through form and sound, they give rise to doubts and difficulties:
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864b28_15']	若法身體無諸相不可見聞，非修福德業可得者，諸菩薩摩訶薩三大阿僧祇所修功德智慧十地勝因，為當定有所得、定無所得也？	若法身體無諸相不可見聞，非修福德業可得者，諸菩薩摩訶薩三大阿僧祇所修功德智慧十地勝因，為當定有所得、定無所得也？	If the Dharma body has no characteristics and cannot be seen or heard, and cannot be attained by cultivating meritorious deeds, then the great asankhyeya of merit and wisdom cultivated by bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and the superior causes of the ten grounds, will they definitely have something to attain or definitely have nothing to attain?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c02_1']	若定無所得者，則因果俱失，同於小乘斷滅之見，無菩提可得，前言一切善法得三菩提，此言則壞。	若定無所得者，則因果俱失，同於小乘斷滅之見，無菩提可得，前言一切善法得三菩提，此言則壞。	If they definitely have nothing to attain, then cause and effect are both lost, the same as the view of annihilation of the Hīnayāna, with no bodhi to be attained. The previous statement that all wholesome dharmas attain the three bodhi is then destroyed.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c03_11']	若爾，既無菩提可得，諸菩薩何為三大阿僧祇徒自勞苦而無所剋獲？	若爾，既無菩提可得，諸菩薩何為三大阿僧祇徒自勞苦而無所剋獲？	If that is so, since there is no bodhi to be attained, what are the bodhisattvas doing with the great asankhyeya of their own toil and hardship without any attainment?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c04_10']	所修福德勝因既不感果，向何處去也？	所修福德勝因既不感果，向何處去也？	Since the superior causes of the cultivated merit and virtue do not give rise to results, where do they go?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c05_9']	有如是疑，將釋此疑故，佛問須菩提：	有如是疑，將釋此疑故，佛問須菩提：	Having such doubts, in order to resolve this doubt, the Buddha asks Subhūti:
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c05_14']	於意云何？	於意云何？	What do you think?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c06_8']	如來可以相成就得三菩提不耶？	如來可以相成就得三菩提不耶？	Can the Tathāgata attain the three bodhi by perfecting the characteristics?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c07_4']	此佛還以前人所疑問須菩提也。	此佛還以前人所疑問須菩提也。	This Buddha is still asking Subhūti about the question asked by the previous person.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c07_17']	「莫作是念」者，遮其所見。	「莫作是念」者，遮其所見。	Do not have this thought means to block his view.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c08_15']	汝莫作是念，謂法身佛同於報佛修福相可得。	汝莫作是念，謂法身佛同於報佛修福相可得。	You should not have this thought, thinking that the Dharma-body Buddha is the same as the reward-body Buddha, and that the appearance of cultivating merit can be attained.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c09_3']	此未是正答也。	此未是正答也。	This is not yet the correct answer.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c09_10']	「汝若作是念：	「汝若作是念：	If you have this thought:
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c09_17']	菩薩發三菩提。	菩薩發三菩提。	The bodhisattva gives rise to the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c10_13']	說諸法斷滅相」者，明須菩提疑云：	說諸法斷滅相」者，明須菩提疑云：	And speaks of the characteristics of the annihilation of all dharmas, this clarifies Subhūti's doubt, which is:
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c12_12']	若不可以相成就得三菩提者，菩薩則所修功德智慧之因，果畢竟無有菩提果可得。	若不可以相成就得三菩提者，菩薩則所修功德智慧之因，果畢竟無有菩提果可得。	If supreme, perfect enlightenment cannot be attained through the accomplishment of characteristics, then the bodhisattva's cultivation of meritorious virtues and wisdom will ultimately have no fruit of supreme, perfect enlightenment to attain.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c14_4']	若無菩提可得，則因無所招，便失福因亦失果報，故云說斷滅相也。	若無菩提可得，則因無所招，便失福因亦失果報，故云說斷滅相也。	If there is no supreme, perfect enlightenment to attain, then the cause will have nothing to attract, and one will lose the cause of blessings and also lose the reward of blessings, so it is said to be the characteristics of annihilation.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c15_8']	所以此中乃言菩薩發三菩提心者說諸法斷滅相也。	所以此中乃言菩薩發三菩提心者說諸法斷滅相也。	Therefore, in this section it is said that the bodhisattva who gives rise to the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment speaks of the characteristics of the annihilation of all dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c17_13']	然小乘之人，以自身所證灰身涅槃畢竟滅故，即以己所得准於菩薩謂亦聞其所得，故起斷滅相。	然小乘之人，以自身所證灰身涅槃畢竟滅故，即以己所得准於菩薩謂亦聞其所得，故起斷滅相。	However, the people of the Lesser Vehicle, because they personally experience the nirvāṇa of extinguishing the body as ultimate cessation, they use what they have attained to measure what the Bodhisattvas have attained and also hear of their attainments, thus giving rise to the appearance of annihilation.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c18_13']	此小乘人，於菩薩法中齊何處來作斷滅意？	此小乘人，於菩薩法中齊何處來作斷滅意？	To what extent does this person of the Lesser Vehicle come in the Bodhisattva's teachings to give rise to the intention of annihilation?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c19_4']	有曇無德、彌沙塞人。	有曇無德、彌沙塞人。	There are the Dharmaguptakas and the Mahīśāsakas.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c20_16']	此二家小乘計，得初地無生忍解時，捨一切地前所修功德亦不受果報。	此二家小乘計，得初地無生忍解時，捨一切地前所修功德亦不受果報。	The two schools of the Lesser Vehicle calculate that when one attains the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas on the first ground, one abandons all the merits cultivated before the grounds and also does not receive karmic retribution.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c21_2']	何故如此？	何故如此？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c23_1']	小乘人斷三界煩惱、盡分段生死，灰身滅智入無餘涅槃，善惡因果一切俱捨。	小乘人斷三界煩惱、盡分段生死，灰身滅智入無餘涅槃，善惡因果一切俱捨。	The people of the Lesser Vehicle sever the afflictions of the three realms, exhaust the birth and death of the segmented body, extinguish the body and destroy cognition, and enter nirvāṇa without remainder, abandoning all the causes and effects of good and evil.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c25_12']	既見初地菩薩斷四住煩惱出於分段生死，意謂聞已滅於身智，亦捨因中萬行及失果報，故言說諸法斷滅相。	既見初地菩薩斷四住煩惱出於分段生死，意謂聞已滅於身智，亦捨因中萬行及失果報，故言說諸法斷滅相。	Since they see that Bodhisattvas on the first ground sever the afflictions of the four abodes and transcend the birth and death of the segmented body, they think that they have heard of the extinction of the body and cognition, and also abandon the myriad practices in the cause and lose karmic retribution, thus saying that they speak of the appearance of the annihilation of all dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0864c29_7']	復有一家小乘曇無德人計，謂至五地六地，作十四諦觀，善學五明及十種逆慎觀十二因緣，方得無生忍，斷三界煩惱、出分段生死，灰身盡智無餘涅槃。	復有一家小乘曇無德人計，謂至五地六地，作十四諦觀，善學五明及十種逆慎觀十二因緣，方得無生忍，斷三界煩惱、出分段生死，灰身盡智無餘涅槃。	There is also a family of Hīnayāna Dharmaguptakas who calculate that up to the fifth or sixth ground, one contemplates the fourteen truths, skillfully studies the five sciences and the ten kinds of careful observation of dependent origination, and only then attains the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, cuts off the afflictions of the three realms, escapes from the birth and death of the segmented body, and attains nirvāṇa without remainder with the extinction of the body and mind.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a01_1', 'ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a03_16']	爾時同小乘斷滅，因果俱失。🔽後有一家薩婆多中日出道人計，第七地中始得無生忍，方盡三界煩惱、出分段生死，同已小乘捨於身智亦無依報淨土。	爾時同小乘斷滅，因果俱失。 後有一家薩婆多中日出道人計，第七地中始得無生忍，方盡三界煩惱、出分段生死，同已小乘捨於身智亦無依報淨土。	At that time, they are the same as the Hīnayāna in being extinguished, and both cause and effect are lost.🔽Later, there is a family within the Sarvâstivāda who calculate that in the seventh ground one begins to attain the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, and only then exhausts the afflictions of the three realms, escapes from the birth and death of the segmented body, and is the same as the Hīnayāna in abandoning the body and mind and also having no pure land of dependent reward.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a05_18']	復有一家小乘計，至八地中得大無生忍無功用解，爾時方出三界，捨於身智一切皆失。	復有一家小乘計，至八地中得大無生忍無功用解，爾時方出三界，捨於身智一切皆失。	There is also a family of Hīnayāna who calculate that in the eighth ground one attains the great acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas and effortless understanding, and at that time one escapes from the three realms and abandons the body and mind, all of which are lost.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a09_8']	最後一家薩婆多人計，十地中始得阿那含，斷三界煩惱盡，金剛心後出分段生死，得阿羅漢即名為佛，入無餘涅槃，捨諸功德滅於身智，故說斷滅相也。	最後一家薩婆多人計，十地中始得阿那含，斷三界煩惱盡，金剛心後出分段生死，得阿羅漢即名為佛，入無餘涅槃，捨諸功德滅於身智，故說斷滅相也。	The last view of the Sarvāstivādins is that one attains the stage of non-returner in the ten grounds, eliminates afflictions of the three realms, and after the vajra-mind emerges from the conditioned birth and death, attains arhatship and is called a buddha. Entering nirvāṇa without remainder, abandoning all merits and extinguishing the body and wisdom, therefore it is said to be the appearance of annihilation.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a10_4']	「須菩提！	「須菩提！	Subhūti!
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a12_6']	莫作是念乃至說諸法斷滅相」者，此且止其見情，明非斷滅，未是正答，依下論中應有一行半。	莫作是念乃至說諸法斷滅相」者，此且止其見情，明非斷滅，未是正答，依下論中應有一行半。	Do not have this thought... speaking of the appearance of annihilation of all dharmas means this temporarily stops their views and clarifies it is not annihilation, but it is not yet the correct answer. According to the following treatise, there should be one and a half lines.

The explanation of why do you stop you and say do not have this thought clarifies that the eternally tranquil unconditioned dharma-body of the past and present, although it cannot be attained through the characteristics of cultivating merit and virtue, the bodhisattva's realization of the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas on the first ground, the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment, up to the supreme fruition of buddhahood, the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment, is not annihilation.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a21_7']	此無生忍三菩提心所以名為不斷滅者，明菩薩由一大阿僧祇所修功德智慧八萬四千波羅蜜行因緣，得初地無生法忍，了出佛性無為法身。	此無生忍三菩提心所以名為不斷滅者，明菩薩由一大阿僧祇所修功德智慧八萬四千波羅蜜行因緣，得初地無生法忍，了出佛性無為法身。	The reason this forbearance of non-arising and the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment are called not annihilation is to clarify that the bodhisattva, due to the causes and conditions of the merit, wisdom, and eighty-four thousand pāramitā practices cultivated over one great incalculable eon, attains the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas on the first ground and understands the unconditioned dharma-body of buddha-nature.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a23_2']	以此一大阿僧祇功德智慧，即與法身理冥，泯然一觀不可分別，故不失因。	以此一大阿僧祇功德智慧，即與法身理冥，泯然一觀不可分別，故不失因。	With this merit and wisdom of one great incalculable eon, it immediately merges with the principle of the dharma-body, and the single contemplation is extinguished, indistinguishable, and therefore does not lose the cause.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a25_1']	既得無生法忍，便分有出世間實報真如法性身上二種涅槃無方圓用故，果亦不失。	既得無生法忍，便分有出世間實報真如法性身上二種涅槃無方圓用故，果亦不失。	Having attained the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas, one then distinguishes the two kinds of nirvāṇa that are based on the supramundane true suchness of real retribution, because they have the function of being square or round. Therefore, the effect is also not lost.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a26_10']	乃至第二第三阿僧祇，因果皆如是不失，故言於法不就斷滅相也。	乃至第二第三阿僧祇，因果皆如是不失，故言於法不就斷滅相也。	Up to the second and third asaṃkhyeya kalpas, the causes and effects are all like this and not lost, so it is said that one does not grasp at the characteristics of annihilation in the Dharma.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865a29_8']	今者如來將明菩薩於初地中得無生法忍，乃至十地無漏功德及果頭圓報悉皆不失，不聞小乘捨於身智失無漏果報。	今者如來將明菩薩於初地中得無生法忍，乃至十地無漏功德及果頭圓報悉皆不失，不聞小乘捨於身智失無漏果報。	Now, the Tathāgata is about to clarify that the bodhisattva attains the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas in the first ground, up to the tenth ground, and that all the pure merits and effects are not lost. He does not hear of the Lesser Vehicle abandoning the body and wisdom and losing the retribution of the pure effects.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b02_16']	若爾得無漏功德，可容不失地前有漏功德是世間法，得出世解時應捨此功德，未知地前因行為失不失？	若爾得無漏功德，可容不失地前有漏功德是世間法，得出世解時應捨此功德，未知地前因行為失不失？	If that is so, one may be able to retain the pure merits attained, but the contaminated merits of the grounds below are worldly dharmas. When one attains supramundane understanding, one should abandon these merits. One does not yet know whether the causes and practices of the grounds below are lost or not lost.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b03_8']	故即答世間功德亦不失。	故即答世間功德亦不失。	Therefore, it immediately answers that even the worldly merits are not lost.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b03_13']	何以故爾？	何以故爾？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b04_8']	要世間善滿，得出世間善轉。	要世間善滿，得出世間善轉。	It is necessary for worldly goodness to be fulfilled in order to attain the turning of supramundane goodness.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b09_1']	地前有漏功德作彼地上無漏功德轉轉增勝，菩薩爾時境智雙夷泯然一觀，不見有世間出世間及能照所照之異，唯有真如一味等味，如萬川歸海同一醎味，無有諸河味別故，亦不失地前功德也。	地前有漏功德作彼地上無漏功德轉轉增勝，菩薩爾時境智雙夷泯然一觀，不見有世間出世間及能照所照之異，唯有真如一味等味，如萬川歸海同一醎味，無有諸河味別故，亦不失地前功德也。	The contaminated merits of the stages below the grounds transform and increase the uncontaminated merits of the stages above the grounds. At that time, the bodhisattva's objects and wisdom are both completely extinguished, and there is only a single contemplation. He does not see any difference between the mundane and supramundane, or between the illuminator and the illuminated. There is only the single flavor of suchness, equal to all flavors, like the myriad streams returning to the ocean with a single salty flavor, because the flavors of the various rivers are no longer distinct. He also does not lose the merits of the stages below the grounds.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b10_8']	初地既爾不失功德，乃至十地無漏功德及以果報皆不失也。	初地既爾不失功德，乃至十地無漏功德及以果報皆不失也。	If the merits are not lost in the first ground, then the uncontaminated merits and karmic rewards of the ten grounds are all not lost.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b12_4']	此中就三大阿僧祇劫三時辨因果，若以地前為因，初地無生法忍見道為果；	此中就三大阿僧祇劫三時辨因果，若以地前為因，初地無生法忍見道為果；	Here, the causes and effects are distinguished in three periods over the three great incalculable eons. If the stages below the grounds are taken as the cause, then the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas in the path of seeing in the first ground is the effect;
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b13_11']	若七地已還修道勝行為因，八地中大無生忍無功用道為果；	若七地已還修道勝行為因，八地中大無生忍無功用道為果；	If the superior practices in the path of cultivation up to the seventh ground are taken as the cause, then the great forbearance of non-arising in the effortless path of the eighth ground is the effect;
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b14_12']	若金以還無功用行為因，佛地功德為果。	若金以還無功用行為因，佛地功德為果。	If the effortless practices up to the golden ground are taken as the cause, then the merits of the buddha ground are the effect.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b15_7']	如今廣解，地地相望皆有因果。	如今廣解，地地相望皆有因果。	Now, in the extensive explanation, each stage is compared to have causes and effects.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b15_12']	乘生疑問：	乘生疑問：	The vehicle gives rise to questions:
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b17_3']	若得初地無生忍乃至十地，不失功德非斷滅者，可得幾許功德？	若得初地無生忍乃至十地，不失功德非斷滅者，可得幾許功德？	If one attains the patience of non-arising in the first ground up to the tenth ground, and does not lose meritorious virtues that are not extinguished, how much merit can one obtain?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b17_8']	為多為少？	為多為少？	Is it much or little?
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b20_10']	應有此疑問故，引恒沙七寶施福挍量，明得福甚多，用比初地無生忍無漏功德乃至一念，百千萬億不及一分，明此有漏功德甚為多也。	應有此疑問故，引恒沙七寶施福挍量，明得福甚多，用比初地無生忍無漏功德乃至一念，百千萬億不及一分，明此有漏功德甚為多也。	Since there should be this question, it cites the merit of giving the seven treasures of the Ganges as a comparison, clarifying that the obtained merit is very much. Using it to compare to a single thought-moment of the merit of the patience of non-arising and the pure merit of the first ground, it does not reach even a hundredth, a thousandth, or a millionth, clarifying that this contaminated merit is very much.
['ZH_T25_1512_009:0865b22_12']	縱使七寶施福是無漏，甚多雖多，比於無生忍一念功德，亦百千萬億恒河沙倍不可為喻也。	縱使七寶施福是無漏，甚多雖多，比於無生忍一念功德，亦百千萬億恒河沙倍不可為喻也。	Even if the merit of giving the seven treasures is pure and very much, compared to a single thought-moment of the merit of the patience of non-arising, it is still not comparable to a hundredth, a thousandth, or a millionth of the Ganges' sands.

The essence of suchness is originally quiescent and transcends the characteristics of self and non-self, which is also called non-arising. It can also be said to be free from the three characteristics.

Above, Subhuti seems to misunderstand the Buddha's meaning.

This means that when a bodhisattva attains the acceptance of non-arising, there are two kinds of understanding of no-self, but one does not give rise to the characteristics of the two kinds of no-self. Therefore, one only accepts the merits of the acceptance of non-arising on the grounds, and does not grasp the contaminated merits and virtues from the stage before the grounds.

Beings benefit from it, and it is truly not in vain.

This explains the previous sūtra passage, Why is it so? If one says the Tathāgata comes and goes, sits and lies down, one does not understand the meaning of what I say. It is because one sees the response body coming and going to transform beings according to conditions, and thinks the Dharma body is also like that, that it is said one does not understand.
