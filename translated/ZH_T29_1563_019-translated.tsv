['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c19_14']	身語二業等起有二，謂因等起、剎那等起，在先為因故，彼剎那有故。	身語二業等起有二，謂因等起、剎那等起，在先為因故，彼剎那有故。	019	The two kinds of action, bodily and vocal, are twofold: that which is instigated and that which is manifested. The first is instigated by the cause, and the second is manifested in that moment.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c20_7']	如次初名轉，第二名隨轉。	如次初名轉，第二名隨轉。	019	The two kinds of action, bodily and vocal, are twofold in origination: origination as cause and origination as moment. The first is called transformation and the second is called following transformation.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c21_1']	謂因等起將作業時，作是思惟：	謂因等起將作業時，作是思惟：	019	That is, when the origination as cause is about to produce action, it thinks,
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c21_14']	我今當作如是如是所應作業。	我今當作如是如是所應作業。	019	I will now produce this kind of action that should be produced.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c22_4']	能引發故，說名為轉。	能引發故，說名為轉。	019	Because it is able to project, it is called transformation.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c23_12']	剎那等起正作業時，與先轉心所引發業俱時行故，說名隨轉。	剎那等起正作業時，與先轉心所引發業俱時行故，說名隨轉。	019	When the origination as moment is about to produce action, it is said to follow transformation because it occurs simultaneously with the action projected by the prior transformation.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c25_1']	若無隨轉，雖有先因為能引發，如無心位或如死屍，表應不轉。	若無隨轉，雖有先因為能引發，如無心位或如死屍，表應不轉。	019	If there were no following transformation, then even though there is a prior cause that is able to project, it would be as if there were no mind, or as if there were a dead body, and the indication would not be transformed.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c26_8']	隨轉於表有轉功能，無表不依隨轉而轉，無心亦有無表轉故。	隨轉於表有轉功能，無表不依隨轉而轉，無心亦有無表轉故。	019	Following transformation has the power to transform the indication, but the nonindication does not transform in dependence on following transformation, because even when there is no mind, there is transformation of the nonindication.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c27_8']	如上所言，見所斷惑內門轉故不能發表。	如上所言，見所斷惑內門轉故不能發表。	019	As was said above, the false views that are eliminated by the path of insight are internal and do not transform and therefore cannot produce the indications.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c27_18']	若爾，何緣薄伽梵說：	若爾，何緣薄伽梵說：	019	If this is so, why did the Bhagavat say,
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c28_18']	由邪見故，起邪思惟、邪語、邪業及邪命等。	由邪見故，起邪思惟、邪語、邪業及邪命等。	019	Because of wrong views, one gives rise to wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0864c29_3']	此不相違。	此不相違。	019	This is not contradictory.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a02_10']	見所斷識於發表業但能為轉，於能起表尋伺生中為資糧故不為隨轉，於外門心正起業時此無有故。	見所斷識於發表業但能為轉，於能起表尋伺生中為資糧故不為隨轉，於外門心正起業時此無有故。	019	The consciousness eliminated by the path of insight only serves as the instigator in the production of action that expresses, because it is the provision for the search and deliberation that give rise to that which expresses. It does not serve as the prompter, because it does not exist at the time the mind of the door of consciousness is about to produce action.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a03_18']	由此故說見所斷心為因等起發身語業，定不能為剎那等起。	由此故說見所斷心為因等起發身語業，定不能為剎那等起。	019	Consequently, it is said that the mind eliminated by the path of insight serves as the instigator of the cause of the production of bodily and vocal action, but it definitely cannot serve as the prompter of the moment.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a04_17']	見所斷識雖能思量，而無功能動身發語。	見所斷識雖能思量，而無功能動身發語。	019	Even though the consciousness eliminated by the path of insight is able to think, it is powerless to move the body and produce speech.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a06_15']	然於動發一表業中，容有多心思量動發，唯後一念與表俱行，異此表應非剎那性。	然於動發一表業中，容有多心思量動發，唯後一念與表俱行，異此表應非剎那性。	019	However, in the production of one action that expresses, there may be many thoughts that think and move, but only the last moment accompanies the action that expresses. If it were otherwise, the action that expresses would not be momentary.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a09_3']	見所斷識雖能為轉發有表業，然非表業於此識後無間即生，內門轉心不能引起，與身語表俱行識故。	見所斷識雖能為轉發有表業，然非表業於此識後無間即生，內門轉心不能引起，與身語表俱行識故。	019	Even though the consciousness eliminated by the path of insight is able to instigate the production of action that expresses, nevertheless, the action that expresses is not produced immediately after this consciousness, because the mind that evolves internally is unable to arouse the consciousness that accompanies action that expresses of body and speech.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a11_14']	若異此者，見所斷心亦應於表業為剎那等起，以修所斷加行意識能無間引表俱行心，亦與表俱行為剎那等起。	若異此者，見所斷心亦應於表業為剎那等起，以修所斷加行意識能無間引表俱行心，亦與表俱行為剎那等起。	019	If it were otherwise, then the mind of the realm of formlessness that is to be eliminated by the path of insight would also be the cause that instigates the initial arising of the volition that is the act of informing, because the mind of the realm of desire that is to be eliminated by the path of cultivation and is the volition that is the act of informing can immediately instigate the mind that is associated with the volition that is the act of informing.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a14_1']	故見所斷雖能為因引諸表業，離修所斷因等起心，表俱行心無容得起，是故欲界無有有覆無記表業。	故見所斷雖能為因引諸表業，離修所斷因等起心，表俱行心無容得起，是故欲界無有有覆無記表業。	019	Therefore, although the mind of the realm of formlessness that is to be eliminated by the path of insight can be the cause that instigates the volition that is the act of informing, apart from the cause that instigates the mind that is to be eliminated by the path of cultivation, the mind that is associated with the volition that is the act of informing cannot occur. Therefore there is no volition that is the act of informing that is morally nondefined and that is to be eliminated by the path of cultivation in the realm of desire.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a15_1']	然契經中但據展轉為因等起密作是言：	然契經中但據展轉為因等起密作是言：	019	However, the scriptures only speak of the instigation of the cause that is the volition that is the act of informing in terms of the mutual instigation of the cause that instigates the volition that is the act of informing.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a15_10']	由邪見故起邪語等。	由邪見故起邪語等。	019	It is said, “Because of wrong views, wrong speech, etc., are produced.”
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a17_8']	阿毘達磨據彼不能無間引生表俱行識，故密意說，見所斷心內門轉故不能發表。	阿毘達磨據彼不能無間引生表俱行識，故密意說，見所斷心內門轉故不能發表。	019	The Abhidharma speaks of the inability to immediately instigate the volition that is the act of informing, and therefore it says in an obscure way that the mind that is to be eliminated by the path of insight evolves internally and therefore is unable to instigate the volition that is the act of informing.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a17_17']	是故經論理不相違。	是故經論理不相違。	019	Therefore the scriptures and the Abhidharma do not contradict reason.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a18_16']	又見所斷若發表色，此色則應是見所斷。	又見所斷若發表色，此色則應是見所斷。	019	Moreover, if the mind that is to be eliminated by the path of insight instigates the form of the volition that is the act of informing, then this form would be eliminated by the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a19_7']	色非見斷，前已成立。	色非見斷，前已成立。	019	However, form is not eliminated by the path of insight, as has been established previously.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a20_6']	若五識身唯作隨轉，無分別故、外門轉故。	若五識身唯作隨轉，無分別故、外門轉故。	019	The manas of the realm of formlessness is only a leader, not a follower, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a21_6', 'ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a21_15', 'ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a22_8']	修斷意識有通二種，有分別故、外門轉故。🔽由此應成四句分別。🔽有轉非隨轉，謂見所斷心。	修斷意識有通二種，有分別故、外門轉故。 由此應成四句分別。 有轉非隨轉，謂見所斷心。	019	The manas of the two upper realms is both leader and follower, because it is discriminative and evolves toward external objects.🔽The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a22_20', 'ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a23_14']	有隨轉非轉，謂眼等五識。🔽有轉亦隨轉，謂修所斷一分意識。	有隨轉非轉，謂眼等五識。 有轉亦隨轉，謂修所斷一分意識。	019	The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.🔽The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.🔽The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.🔽The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.

['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a26_7']	轉隨轉識性必同耶？	轉隨轉識性必同耶？	019	The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.

['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865a28_2']	謂前轉識若是善性，後隨轉識通善等三，不善無記為轉亦爾。	謂前轉識若是善性，後隨轉識通善等三，不善無記為轉亦爾。	019	The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward external objects.🔽The manas of the realm of desire is only a follower, not a leader, because it is nondiscriminative and does not evolve toward
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865b01_12']	唯牟尼尊轉隨轉識，多分同性少有不同，謂轉若善心隨轉亦善，轉心若無記隨轉亦然，於續剎那定無迷故。	唯牟尼尊轉隨轉識，多分同性少有不同，謂轉若善心隨轉亦善，轉心若無記隨轉亦然，於續剎那定無迷故。	019	Only the Buddha, the Muni, has the same nature in the majority of cases in the transformation and following of consciousness, but there are a few cases of difference. That is, if the transforming mind is good, the following mind is also good. If the transforming mind is indeterminate, the following mind is also so, because there is no confusion in the continuity of moments.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865b03_11']	而或有位善隨無記轉，曾無有時無記隨善轉，以佛世尊於說法等心或增長無萎歇故。	而或有位善隨無記轉，曾無有時無記隨善轉，以佛世尊於說法等心或增長無萎歇故。	019	However, there are times when the good following mind transforms with the indeterminate, but there is never a time when the indeterminate follows the good, because the mind of the Buddha, the World Honored One, in preaching the Dharma, etc., sometimes increases and never declines.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865b05_11']	既說善等轉隨轉各三，准此標釋中足為明證，所發諸業成善惡等，隨因等起非隨剎那。	既說善等轉隨轉各三，准此標釋中足為明證，所發諸業成善惡等，隨因等起非隨剎那。	019	Since it is said that the transformation and following of good, etc., each have three kinds, this is a clear proof in the verses and prose of the Abhidharmasamuccaya. The various actions produced are established as good, evil, etc., according to the cause that instigates them, not according to the moment.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865b06_19']	異此善心所引發業，既與不善無記心俱，何理能遮成惡無記？	異此善心所引發業，既與不善無記心俱，何理能遮成惡無記？	019	If it were otherwise, the actions instigated by a good mind would be accompanied by bad and indeterminate minds. What principle could prevent them from becoming bad or indeterminate?

['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865b10_8']	故業成善等定由轉力，非由隨轉力，其理善成。	故業成善等定由轉力，非由隨轉力，其理善成。	019	Therefore, the formation of good and so forth is definitely due to the power of transformation, not due to the power of following. This principle is well established.
['ZH_T29_1563_019:0865b11_7']	然隨定心，諸無表業與俱時起，心一果故。	然隨定心，諸無表業與俱時起，心一果故。	019	However, all the unmanifest actions that arise simultaneously with the mind are the fruit of a single mind,
