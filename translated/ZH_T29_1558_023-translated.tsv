['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c07_2']	論曰：	論曰：	023	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c08_10']	即前隨信隨法行者，至第十六道類智心名為住果，不復名向。	即前隨信隨法行者，至第十六道類智心名為住果，不復名向。	023	Those who previously followed faith and those who followed the Dharma, up to the sixteenth mind of the cognition of the path of the noble ones, are called abiding in the fruits and are no longer called heading for the fruits.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c10_13']	隨前三向今住三果，謂前預流向今住預流果，前一來向今住一來果，前不還向今住不還果。	隨前三向今住三果，謂前預流向今住預流果，前一來向今住一來果，前不還向今住不還果。	023	The first three of these are the three fruits, because the former path of the candidate for the fruit of stream-winner is now the fruit of stream-winner, the former path of the candidate for the fruit of once-returner is now the fruit of once-returner, and the former path of the candidate for the fruit of non-returner is now the fruit of non-returner.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c12_4']	阿羅漢果必無初得，見道無容斷修惑故，世道無容離有頂故。	阿羅漢果必無初得，見道無容斷修惑故，世道無容離有頂故。	023	The fruit of arhat is never first acquired, because it is impossible for the path of insight to eliminate the passions that are to be eliminated by the path of cultivation, and it is impossible for the mundane path to eliminate the passions of the peak of existence.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c14_5']	至住果位捨得二名，謂不復名隨信法行，轉得信解、見至二名，此亦由根鈍利差別。	至住果位捨得二名，謂不復名隨信法行，轉得信解、見至二名，此亦由根鈍利差別。	023	When one reaches the state of abiding in the fruit, one abandons the two names of candidate for the fruit of stream-winner and candidate for the fruit of once-returner, and one acquires the two names of one who has attained the view of right faith and one who has attained by the power of insight. This is also due to the difference of dullness and sharpness of faculties.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c15_15']	諸鈍根者先名隨信行今名信解，諸利根者先名隨法行今名見至。	諸鈍根者先名隨信行今名信解，諸利根者先名隨法行今名見至。	023	Those of dull faculties are called those who have attained the view of right faith, and now they are called those who have attained by faith. Those of sharp faculties are called those who have attained by the power of insight, and now they are called those who have attained by the power of insight.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c16_16']	此二聖者信慧互增，故標信解、見至名別。	此二聖者信慧互增，故標信解、見至名別。	023	These two saints are distinguished by the names of those who have attained by faith and those who have attained by the power of insight because of the difference of the predominance of faith and the predominance of insight.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c18_14']	何緣先斷欲界修惑一至五等，至第十六道類智心但說名為預流果等，非後果向？	何緣先斷欲界修惑一至五等，至第十六道類智心但說名為預流果等，非後果向？	023	Why is it that when one first eliminates one to five categories of the passions of the realm of desire that are to be eliminated by cultivation, etc., up to the sixteenth mind of the path of insight into the single method of the class of the superior man, one is only said to be the fruit of stream-winner, etc., and not a candidate for the subsequent fruits?

Therefore, as long as one who abides in the fruit has not yet aroused the path of the superior fruit, one is only called one who abides in the fruit, not one who is progressing towards the subsequent fruit.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c24_11']	然諸先斷欲界修惑一至五等，至得果時，此生必定起勝果道。	然諸先斷欲界修惑一至五等，至得果時，此生必定起勝果道。	023	However, those who have previously severed one to five levels of the afflictions of the desire realm, when they attain the fruit, in this life they will definitely arouse the path of the superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c26_10']	由此先離三靜慮染後依下地入見道者，彼得果已於現生中必能引生後勝果道。	由此先離三靜慮染後依下地入見道者，彼得果已於現生中必能引生後勝果道。	023	For this reason, those who have previously severed the defilements of the three meditations and later rely on the lower stages to enter the path of seeing, when they attain the fruit, in the present life they will definitely be able to induce the subsequent path of the superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0122c27_10']	若異此者，聖生上地應不可說定成樂根。	若異此者，聖生上地應不可說定成樂根。	023	If it were otherwise, then the noble ones born in the upper stages would not be able to be said to definitely possess the faculty of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0123a01_3']	如是已依先具倍離及全離欲入見諦者十六心位立眾聖別，當約修惑辯漸次生能對治道分位差別。	如是已依先具倍離及全離欲入見諦者十六心位立眾聖別，當約修惑辯漸次生能對治道分位差別。	023	In this way, based on those who are already endowed with the complete severance of the desire realm and the complete severance of the desire realm, and those who enter the path of seeing with the sixteen moments of mind, the distinctions among the various noble ones are established. Next, we will discuss the gradual arising of the counteracting paths that are able to eliminate the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm, and the distinctions in their stages.

['ZH_T29_1558_023:0123a10_1']	謂根本品有下中上，此三各分下中上別，由此失德各分九品，謂下下、下中、下上，中下、中中、中上，上下、上中、上上品。	謂根本品有下中上，此三各分下中上別，由此失德各分九品，謂下下、下中、下上，中下、中中、中上，上下、上中、上上品。	023	The fundamental grades have lower, middle, and upper, and each of these three is further divided into lower, middle, and upper distinctions. Thus the losses and merits are each divided into nine grades, namely lower-lower, lower-middle, lower-upper, middle-lower, middle-middle, middle-upper, upper-lower, upper-middle, and upper-upper grades.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0123a11_16']	應知此中下下品道勢力能斷上上品障，如是乃至上上品道勢力能斷下下品障。	應知此中下下品道勢力能斷上上品障，如是乃至上上品道勢力能斷下下品障。	023	You should know that in this context, the power of the lower-lower grade path can eliminate the upper-upper grade obstacles, and so on, up to the power of the upper-upper grade path being able to eliminate the lower-lower grade obstacles.
['ZH_T29_1558_023:0123a13_6']	上上品等諸能治德初未有故，此德有時上上品等失已無故。	上上品等諸能治德初未有故，此德有時上上品等失已無故。	023	because the virtues that are the counteragents to the upper-upper stage, etc., do not exist at the beginning, and because the faults of the upper-upper stage, etc., do not exist when these virtues exist.
