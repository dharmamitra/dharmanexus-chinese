If you practice, cultivate, and do much of compassion, it can eliminate harmfulness. If you practice, cultivate, and do much of sympathetic joy, it can eliminate dissatisfaction. If you practice, cultivate, and do much of equanimity, it can eliminate desire and hatred. Therefore there are only four.

['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b08_2']	又違本論：	又違本論：	040	Moreover, this contradicts the Abhidharma-nyāyânusāra-śāstra, which says,

['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b08_18']	謂喜喜相應受想行識等。	謂喜喜相應受想行識等。	040	It is feeling, conceptualization, volition, and consciousness associated with joy.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b10_6']	此中意顯喜俱品法喜增上故，總立喜名非受，受俱其理決定。	此中意顯喜俱品法喜增上故，總立喜名非受，受俱其理決定。	040	The meaning here is that dharmas associated with joy are predominant in joy, and therefore joy is established in general, not feeling. The reason for this is certain.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b10_18']	若喜即喜受，何言與受俱？	若喜即喜受，何言與受俱？	040	If joy is the feeling of joy, why is it said to be associated with feeling?

['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b12_16']	此亦不然，理為量論，要有經證方可定文；	此亦不然，理為量論，要有經證方可定文；	040	This is also not so. In a treatise that takes reason as its standard, one must have the support of a sūtra in order to determine the text.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b13_15']	若與經違，理必可壞，不應隨意輒改論文。	若與經違，理必可壞，不應隨意輒改論文。	040	If it contradicts the sūtras, the reason must be faulty. One should not change the text of the treatise at will.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b14_13']	是故此喜定非喜受，以欣為體或即無貪。	是故此喜定非喜受，以欣為體或即無貪。	040	Therefore this joy is definitely not the feeling of joy, but takes delight as its essence or is simply the absence of greed.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b15_12']	謂別有貪是惡心所，於有情類作是思惟：	謂別有貪是惡心所，於有情類作是思惟：	040	That is, there is a separate craving that is a mental activity, and it thinks in regard to sentient beings:
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b16_11']	云何當令諸所有樂，彼不能得皆屬於我。	云何當令諸所有樂，彼不能得皆屬於我。	040	How can I make all their happiness not be obtained and belong to me?
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b17_1']	喜能治彼，故是無貪。	喜能治彼，故是無貪。	040	Joy can eliminate this, and therefore it is noncraving.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b18_4']	此與喜根必俱行故，三地可得，如悔憂俱喜亦無貪。	此與喜根必俱行故，三地可得，如悔憂俱喜亦無貪。	040	Because it must occur together with the faculty of joy, it can be found in three stages, just as regret is associated with sorrow. Joy is also noncraving.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b20_7']	分明相者，於他盛事心不貪著，知他獲得深生欣慰，心熱對治說名為喜，故知此喜亦無貪性。	分明相者，於他盛事心不貪著，知他獲得深生欣慰，心熱對治說名為喜，故知此喜亦無貪性。	040	The distinct characteristic of joy is that the mind is not attached to the prosperity of others, and one deeply rejoices in the attainment of others, and it is said to be the antidote to mental heat. Therefore we know that this joy is also by nature noncraving.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b22_5']	捨無量體唯是無貪，此與第三有差別者，離愛恚相等緣有情，如創入林等生樹覺。	捨無量體唯是無貪，此與第三有差別者，離愛恚相等緣有情，如創入林等生樹覺。	040	The substance of the immeasurableness of equanimity is only noncraving. The difference between this and the third is that it is characterized by the absence of love and hatred and is equally applied to sentient beings, just as when one first enters a forest, one perceives only trees.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b22_14']	平等行因說名為捨。	平等行因說名為捨。	040	The cause of the practice of equality is called equanimity.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b23_14']	若捨無量亦能治瞋，寧唯無貪，與慈何異？	若捨無量亦能治瞋，寧唯無貪，與慈何異？	040	If equanimity can also eliminate hatred, how can it be only noncraving, and how does it differ from loving-kindness?
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b24_12']	又許此捨正治欲貪，與不淨觀有何差別？	又許此捨正治欲貪，與不淨觀有何差別？	040	Also, it is admitted that this equanimity is the antidote to lust, but what is the difference between it and the contemplation of impurity?
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b25_16']	且捨與慈有差別者，慈能對治瞋所引瞋，無瞋為體；	且捨與慈有差別者，慈能對治瞋所引瞋，無瞋為體；	040	As for the difference between equanimity and loving-kindness, loving-kindness is able to counteract hatred induced by anger, and its substance is the absence of hatred.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b26_11', 'ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b27_10']	捨能對治貪所引瞋，無貪為體。🔽豈不如捨無貪為性，亦能對治貪所引瞋？	捨能對治貪所引瞋，無貪為體。 豈不如捨無貪為性，亦能對治貪所引瞋？	040	Equanimity is able to counteract hatred induced by craving, and its substance is the absence of craving.🔽Isn’t it the case that, just as equanimity has the absence of craving as its nature and is also able to counteract hatred induced by craving,
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b28_8']	如是許慈無瞋為性，亦應能治瞋所引貪。	如是許慈無瞋為性，亦應能治瞋所引貪。	040	in the same way, loving-kindness has the absence of hatred as its nature and should also be able to counteract craving induced by hatred?
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973b28_18']	此難不然，行相違故。	此難不然，行相違故。	040	This objection is not valid, because the modes of activity are different.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c01_7']	謂捨行相雙違貪瞋，捨親非親差別相故，從此愛恚俱不生故。	謂捨行相雙違貪瞋，捨親非親差別相故，從此愛恚俱不生故。	040	That is, the mode of activity of equanimity is to oppose both craving and hatred, because it is indifferent to the distinction of friend and foe, and neither love nor hatred arises from it.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c02_6']	即由此故捨唯無貪，正能治貪兼治瞋故。	即由此故捨唯無貪，正能治貪兼治瞋故。	040	It is precisely because of this that equanimity, which is only the absence of craving, is able to counteract craving and also counteracts hatred.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c03_5']	慈之行相違瞋非貪，於諸有情與樂轉故。	慈之行相違瞋非貪，於諸有情與樂轉故。	040	The mode of activity of loving-kindness opposes hatred but not craving, because it evolves with the bestowal of happiness on sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c04_13', 'ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c05_14']	由此慈捨雖俱違瞋，而慈順貪捨能違害，是故此二極有差別。🔽或修捨者治非處瞋，慈治處瞋，故有差別。	由此慈捨雖俱違瞋，而慈順貪捨能違害，是故此二極有差別。 或修捨者治非處瞋，慈治處瞋，故有差別。	040	Therefore, although both loving-kindness and equanimity oppose anger, loving-kindness conforms to craving, while equanimity is able to oppose harm. Therefore, there is a great difference between these two.🔽Or, one who cultivates equanimity treats anger that is not in a proper place, while loving-kindness treats anger that is in a proper place. Therefore, there is a difference.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c06_12']	不淨與捨，如次能治婬貪餘貪，故有差別。	不淨與捨，如次能治婬貪餘貪，故有差別。	040	Impurity and equanimity are able to treat sexual craving and other craving, respectively. Therefore, there is a difference.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c07_11']	此四無量非損益他，何緣唯善非無記性？	此四無量非損益他，何緣唯善非無記性？	040	These four immeasurables do not benefit or harm others. Why are they only good and not indeterminate?
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c08_19']	能近對治貪瞋等故，愛非愛相不能引故，力能令心自在轉故。	能近對治貪瞋等故，愛非愛相不能引故，力能令心自在轉故。	040	Because they are able to directly counteract craving, hatred, etc., because the characteristics of what is loved and what is not loved cannot attract them, and because they are able to make the mind freely turn.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c09_8']	慈等體相已略分別。	慈等體相已略分別。	040	The essence and characteristics of these four immeasurables have been roughly distinguished.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c11_15']	此阿世耶有差別者，觀有情類如己謂慈，樂有情類離苦謂悲，於他興盛欣慰謂喜，於親怨相不思謂捨。	此阿世耶有差別者，觀有情類如己謂慈，樂有情類離苦謂悲，於他興盛欣慰謂喜，於親怨相不思謂捨。	040	As for the differences in their attitudes, one contemplates sentient beings as oneself, which is called loving-kindness; one wishes for sentient beings to be free from suffering, which is called compassion; one rejoices in the flourishing of others, which is called sympathetic joy; and one does not think of the characteristics of friends and enemies, which is called equanimity.
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c12_14']	又不觀他有損有益，等觀一切如友謂慈；	又不觀他有損有益，等觀一切如友謂慈；	040	Moreover, not observing whether others benefit or harm, one equally regards all as friends, which is called loving-kindness;
['ZH_T29_1563_040:0973c13_4']	於遭苦者哀愍謂悲；	於遭苦者哀愍謂悲；	040	one has pity for those who suffer, which is called compassion;
