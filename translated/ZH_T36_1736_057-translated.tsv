This path includes both the contaminated and uncontaminated two paths, the three knowledges of preparation, root, and subsequent attainment, according to what is appropriate, gradually or suddenly subduing them.

['ZH_T36_1736_057:0448a15_17']	二道除有漏，三智除加行。	二道除有漏，三智除加行。	The two paths exclude the contaminated, and the three knowledges exclude the preparatory.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0448a16_7']	論釋除有漏，有二義故。	論釋除有漏，有二義故。	The treatise explains the exclusion of the contaminated, for two reasons.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0448a17_4']	一有漏曾習相執所引，二未泯相故。	一有漏曾習相執所引，二未泯相故。	First, the contaminated is attracted by the characteristics grasped through past training, and second, it has not yet eliminated characteristics.

Although the other [bases] also serve as the basis for dharmas of delusion and enlightenment, they are not fundamental, so they are not mentioned here.

When the true uninterrupted path is present, the obstacles and their antidotes are mutually contradictory, and they are then eliminated and never again accomplished, which is called abandonment.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0448b02_3']	彼種斷故，不復現行。	彼種斷故，不復現行。	Because their seeds are eliminated, they do not again manifest.

When the diamond-like samādhi is present, it attracts the extremely perfect, bright, and pure root consciousness, because it is not their support, they are all permanently discarded.

['ZH_T36_1736_057:0448b18_7']	無間道中斷二障種，解脫道中方捨此二。	無間道中斷二障種，解脫道中方捨此二。	In the uninterrupted stage, one severs the seeds of the two obstacles, and in the liberation stage one abandons these two.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0448b20_3']	由無間道尚是菩薩，猶有生死有所熏識，未即是佛，是故皆用解脫道捨。	由無間道尚是菩薩，猶有生死有所熏識，未即是佛，是故皆用解脫道捨。	Because the uninterrupted path is still that of a bodhisattva, still subject to birth and death, and still has the perfumed consciousness, it is not yet that of a buddha.

This refers to the first two states of equipment and added effort. Through the practice of resolve and shame and conscience, the power of the seeds of the passions in the root consciousness is decreased, and the power of the seeds of the pure dharmas in the root consciousness is increased. Although one has not yet eliminated the seeds of the obstacles and truly realized the transmutation of the support, still one gradually subdues the actual passions, and this is called transmutation.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450a14_13']	二通達轉，謂通達位，由見道力通達真如，斷分別二障麁重，證得一分真實轉依。	二通達轉，謂通達位，由見道力通達真如，斷分別二障麁重，證得一分真實轉依。	The second is the transformation of thorough understanding, which refers to the state of thorough understanding. Through the power of the path of insight, one thoroughly understands true suchness, eliminates the coarseness of the two obstacles of discrimination, and realizes a part of the true transmutation of the support.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450a16_12']	三修習轉，謂修習位，由數修習十地行故，漸斷俱生二障麁重，漸次證得真實轉依。	三修習轉，謂修習位，由數修習十地行故，漸斷俱生二障麁重，漸次證得真實轉依。	The third is the transformation of cultivation, which refers to the state of cultivation. Through repeated cultivation of the practices of the ten stages, one gradually eliminates the coarseness of the two obstacles that are innate, and one gradually realizes the true transmutation of the support.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450a18_15']	《攝大乘》中說通達轉在真六地，有無相觀通達真俗，間雜現前，令真非真現不現，故說修習。	《攝大乘》中說通達轉在真六地，有無相觀通達真俗，間雜現前，令真非真現不現，故說修習。	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says that the transformation of thorough understanding is in the first six stages, because there is the contemplation of the absence of characteristics that thoroughly understands the two truths, which is mixed with the present, causing the true and the false to appear and not appear. Therefore it is said that it is cultivation.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450a20_10']	轉在後四地，純無相觀長時現前，勇猛修習斷除麁重，多令非真不顯現故。	轉在後四地，純無相觀長時現前，勇猛修習斷除麁重，多令非真不顯現故。	In the latter four grounds, the pure observation of the signless is manifest for a long time, and through vigorous cultivation, the coarseness is eliminated, and the non-true is mostly not manifested.

When leaving the observation, the true does not appear, and because one enters the observation with signs, the non-true appears.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450a24_17']	言後四地多令非真不顯現者，常在無相觀，故多不現。	言後四地多令非真不顯現者，常在無相觀，故多不現。	As for the latter four grounds mostly causing the non-true not to appear, it is because one always abides in the observation of the signless.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450a25_8']	由雜煩惱，未名清淨。	由雜煩惱，未名清淨。	Due to being mixed with afflictions, it is not yet called pure.

Through cultivating boundless difficult and excellent practices for three great incalculable eons, when the vajra-like samādhi appears, one forever eliminates all original coarseness, suddenly realizing the perfect and full transformation of the Buddha fruit, benefiting and delighting endlessly for the duration of the future.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450b03_8']	五下劣轉，謂二乘位專求自利，一厭苦欣寂、二唯能通達生空真如、三斷煩惱種、四證真擇滅、五無勝堪能、六名下劣轉。	五下劣轉，謂二乘位專求自利，一厭苦欣寂、二唯能通達生空真如、三斷煩惱種、四證真擇滅、五無勝堪能、六名下劣轉。	The fifth is the inferior transformation, which refers to the stage of the two vehicles, exclusively seeking self-benefit. One is disgusted with suffering and delights in quiescence, only able to penetrate the true suchness of the emptiness of beings, eliminating the seeds of afflictions, realizing true cessation through discrimination, lacking superior abilities, and is called the inferior transformation.

For the sake of benefiting beings, one aspires for great enlightenment. In both samsara and nirvana, one is neither delighted nor disgusted. One is able to penetrate the true suchness of the two kinds of emptiness, and simultaneously cuts off the seeds of both the obstacle to that which is to be known and the obstacle of the passions. One suddenly realizes supreme enlightenment and nirvana. Having superior ability is called the vast transformation.
['ZH_T36_1736_057:0450b08_10']	此中意說廣大轉依，捨二麁重而證得故。	此中意說廣大轉依，捨二麁重而證得故。	The meaning here is to speak of the vast transformation support, because one abandons the two kinds of coarseness and realizes it.
