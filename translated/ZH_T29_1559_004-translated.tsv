If someone holds that there is a separate virtue called speed that arises in the arrow, and the arrow moves until it falls due to following this virtue, for this person, due to the singularity and unobstructedness of this virtue, the difference in the time taken to reach other places quickly or slowly should not be established.
['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a03_9']	若汝說由風，此德有礙。	若汝說由風，此德有礙。	004	If you say that this virtue is obstructed by the wind,

['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a10_11']	若壽命已盡、福業盡，於死有何能？	若壽命已盡、福業盡，於死有何能？	004	If life is exhausted and meritorious karma is exhausted, what power does one have over death?
['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a11_16']	於福業盡死中，壽命盡亦爾，是故於二盡死，是名俱盡死。	於福業盡死中，壽命盡亦爾，是故於二盡死，是名俱盡死。	004	In death due to the exhaustion of meritorious karma, the exhaustion of life is also so. Therefore, death due to the exhaustion of both is called death due to the exhaustion of both.
['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a12_5']	又於《發慧論》中說：	又於《發慧論》中說：	004	Moreover, in the Prajñaptiśāstra, it is said:

['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a15_7']	若入二定觀，及色無色界眾生，應說壽一起便住。	若入二定觀，及色無色界眾生，應說壽一起便住。	004	If they enter the two concentrations of observation, as well as sentient beings in the form and formless realms, it should be said that their lifespans arise once and then abide.
['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a15_13']	此答顯何義？	此答顯何義？	004	What meaning does this answer reveal?

['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a18_2']	若壽依止不可傷害，如起便住，此是第二句義。	若壽依止不可傷害，如起便住，此是第二句義。	004	If the support of the lifespan cannot be harmed, it arises and then abides. This is the meaning of the second sentence.
['ZH_T29_1559_004:0185a19_14']	第一句顯有障礙，第二句顯無障礙，罽賓國師判義如此，是故有夭抂死。	第一句顯有障礙，第二句顯無障礙，罽賓國師判義如此，是故有夭抂死。	004	The first sentence reveals that there are obstacles, the second sentence reveals that there are no obstacles. The teacher of Kaśmīra judges the meaning like this, therefore there is untimely death.
