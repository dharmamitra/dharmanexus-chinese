['ZH_T26_1530_007:0322c22_6']	別顯相中，有義此中初半顯示清淨法界，次半顯示大圓鏡智，次半顯示平等性智，次半顯示妙觀察智，次半顯示成所作智，次半顯示四智所攝眷屬功德，後半顯示五法所成三身差別。	別顯相中，有義此中初半顯示清淨法界，次半顯示大圓鏡智，次半顯示平等性智，次半顯示妙觀察智，次半顯示成所作智，次半顯示四智所攝眷屬功德，後半顯示五法所成三身差別。	In the specific explanation of characteristics, there is an interpretation that the first half here shows the pure dharma realm, the next half shows the great perfect mirror cognition, the next half shows the cognition of equality, the next half shows the cognition of wonderful observation, the next half shows the cognition accomplishing activities, the next half shows the merits of the retinue subsumed by the four cognitions, and the last half shows the distinctions of the three bodies accomplished by the five dharmas.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0322c25_13']	復有義者，此中顯示清淨法界，有六種相，總攝一切佛地功德，謂自性相、因相、果相、若作業相、若相應相、若差別相，如其次第，初有一頌，餘各半頌。	復有義者，此中顯示清淨法界，有六種相，總攝一切佛地功德，謂自性相、因相、果相、若作業相、若相應相、若差別相，如其次第，初有一頌，餘各半頌。	There is another interpretation: Here it shows the pure dharma realm with six kinds of characteristics, which comprehensively include all the merits of the Buddha ground, namely the characteristic of intrinsic nature, the characteristic of cause, the characteristic of effect, the characteristic of activity, the characteristic of association, and the characteristic of distinction.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a06_12']	但由修習空無我觀，滅障真如我我所執而證得，故名空無我。	但由修習空無我觀，滅障真如我我所執而證得，故名空無我。	However, it is called emptiness and absence of a self because it is realized by the practice of the contemplation of emptiness and absence of a self, and by the elimination of the obstacles of grasping a self and what is possessed in true suchness.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a07_5']	或說三種，謂善、不善、無記。	或說三種，謂善、不善、無記。	It is said to be of three kinds, good, not good, and indeterminate.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a16_6']	五、邪行真如，謂業煩惱集諦實性；	五、邪行真如，謂業煩惱集諦實性；	5. The suchness of wrong practice, that is, the true nature of karma and passions as the truth of the cause of suffering.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a17_2']	六、清淨真如，謂善無為滅諦實性；	六、清淨真如，謂善無為滅諦實性；	6. The suchness of purity, that is, the true nature of good and unconditioned dharmas as the truth of the cessation of suffering.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a18_2']	七，正行真如，謂諸有為無漏善法道諦實性。	七，正行真如，謂諸有為無漏善法道諦實性。	Seventh, the true suchness of right practice, referring to the real nature of the truth of the path, which is the uncontaminated good dharmas with outflows.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a19_16']	或說八種，謂不生不滅、不斷不常、不一不異、不來不去，八遣相門所顯真如。	或說八種，謂不生不滅、不斷不常、不一不異、不來不去，八遣相門所顯真如。	Sometimes eight kinds are mentioned, referring to the true suchness revealed by the eight gates of eliminating characteristics, namely, non-arising, non-cessation, non-annihilation, non-eternality, non-identity, non-difference, non-coming, and non-going.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a21_17']	或說十種，謂於十地除十無明所顯真如，即十法界。	或說十種，謂於十地除十無明所顯真如，即十法界。	Sometimes ten kinds are mentioned, referring to the true suchness revealed by eliminating the ten kinds of ignorance in the ten grounds, which are the ten dharma realms.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a22_9']	如《攝大乘》廣辯名相。	如《攝大乘》廣辯名相。	As extensively explained in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a24_10']	如是增數乃至窮盡，一切法門皆是真如差別之相，而真如體非一非多，分別言說皆不能辯。	如是增數乃至窮盡，一切法門皆是真如差別之相，而真如體非一非多，分別言說皆不能辯。	In this way, increasing the number up to the ultimate limit, all Dharma gates are the characteristics of the distinctions of true suchness, yet the essence of true suchness is neither one nor many, and all discriminating words and explanations cannot describe it.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a25_4']	由離一切虛妄顛倒，假名真如。	由離一切虛妄顛倒，假名真如。	Because it is free from all false inversions, it is provisionally named true suchness.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a26_8']	離損減謗，假名實有。	離損減謗，假名實有。	It is free from the deprecation of nihilism, and is provisionally named truly existent.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a26_18']	離增益謗，假名空無。	離增益謗，假名空無。	It is free from the overestimation that denies and falsely claims emptiness.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a28_6']	分析推求諸法虛假，極至於此更不可度，唯此是真，假名實際。	分析推求諸法虛假，極至於此更不可度，唯此是真，假名實際。	Analyzing and investigating the false names of all dharmas, one finally reaches this point and cannot go beyond it. Only this is the true false name of ultimate reality.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a29_4']	是無分別最勝聖智所證境界，假名勝義。	是無分別最勝聖智所證境界，假名勝義。	This is the realm realized by the supreme holy wisdom of non-discrimination, the false name of ultimate truth.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a29_9']	如是廣說。	如是廣說。	It is explained in detail like this.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a29_14']	言二障者：	言二障者：	As for the two hindrances,
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323a29_20']	一、煩惱障；	一、煩惱障；	the first is the afflictive hindrances;
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b01_5']	二、所知障。	二、所知障。	the second is the cognitive hindrances.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b01_19']	惱亂身心令不寂靜，名煩惱障。	惱亂身心令不寂靜，名煩惱障。	Disturbing the body and mind, causing them to be not tranquil, is called the afflictive hindrances.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b02_16']	覆所知境無顛倒性令不顯現，名所知障。	覆所知境無顛倒性令不顯現，名所知障。	Covering the true nature of knowable objects, causing them not to manifest, is called the cognitive hindrances.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b05_16']	煩惱障者，謂執實我薩迦耶見以為上首，百二十八根本煩惱及隨煩惱，若所發業，若所得果，皆攝在中，皆以煩惱為根本故。	煩惱障者，謂執實我薩迦耶見以為上首，百二十八根本煩惱及隨煩惱，若所發業，若所得果，皆攝在中，皆以煩惱為根本故。	As for the afflictive hindrances, they are headed by the view of real personhood, the one hundred twenty-eight fundamental afflictions and secondary afflictions, as well as the karma they give rise to and the fruits they obtain. They are all included within them, because they all take the afflictions as their root.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b09_3']	所知障者，謂執遍計所執諸法薩迦耶見以為上首，所有無明法愛恚等諸心心法，及所發業并所得果，皆攝在中，皆以法執及無明等為根本故。	所知障者，謂執遍計所執諸法薩迦耶見以為上首，所有無明法愛恚等諸心心法，及所發業并所得果，皆攝在中，皆以法執及無明等為根本故。	As for the obstacle to that which is to be known, it is the ignorance that consists of the view of a real self and its accompaniments that grasps the imagined nature of dharmas as being primary. It includes all the dharmas of mind and mental activities such as the love and hatred of dharmas. The actions that are generated and the results obtained are all included in this obstacle, because they all have the grasping of dharmas and ignorance as their roots.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b11_14']	有義，法執及無明等，遍在一切善惡無記有漏心品及與二乘無漏心品，皆不了達法無我故，皆似相分見分起故。	有義，法執及無明等，遍在一切善惡無記有漏心品及與二乘無漏心品，皆不了達法無我故，皆似相分見分起故。	There is an interpretation that the grasping of dharmas and ignorance, etc., are universally present in all good, evil, and morally neutral impure mind and mental activities and in the pure mind and mental activities of adherents of the two vehicles, because they do not understand and penetrate the nonexistence of the self of dharmas and because they are born resembling the seen part and seeing part.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b12_8']	有義唯在不善無記有漏心品。	有義唯在不善無記有漏心品。	There is an interpretation that ignorance, etc., are only present in impure mind and mental activities that are evil and morally neutral.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b13_3']	《瑜伽師地》說諸無明但有二種：	《瑜伽師地》說諸無明但有二種：	The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that all ignorance is of two kinds:
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b13_8', 'ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b13_13']	一者不善；🔽二者無記。	一者不善； 二者無記。	one is evil and the other is morally neutral.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b13_18', 'ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b14_3']	復有二種：🔽一者染污；	復有二種： 一者染污；	It also says that there are two kinds:
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b14_8']	二不染污。	二不染污。	one is defiled and the other is undefiled.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b15_8']	不言有善，不可非善善心相應，性相違故。	不言有善，不可非善善心相應，性相違故。	It does not say that there is good ignorance, because it cannot be associated with a good mind, because of the incompatibility of natures.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b19_3']	又善心品必與無癡善根相應，癡即無明，不可一心癡無癡並，如貪無貪瞋無瞋等不相應故，不可法執不與癡俱，若無無明無倒執，故如執有我定無明俱，此亦應爾。	又善心品必與無癡善根相應，癡即無明，不可一心癡無癡並，如貪無貪瞋無瞋等不相應故，不可法執不與癡俱，若無無明無倒執，故如執有我定無明俱，此亦應爾。	Also, a class of good thoughts is necessarily associated with the root of goodness that is nondelusion, and delusion is ignorance. Delusion and nondelusion cannot coexist in the same thought, just as craving and noncraving, anger and nonanger, etc., cannot coexist. Therefore, the grasping of dharmas cannot occur simultaneously with nondelusion. If there is no ignorance, there is no grasping, just as if there is a self, there must be ignorance. This is also the case with the grasping of dharmas.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b21_11']	又諸善心性無迷執，皆信等俱順無我解，與二空觀為前方便，不可法執導法空觀，我執未曾見此事故。	又諸善心性無迷執，皆信等俱順無我解，與二空觀為前方便，不可法執導法空觀，我執未曾見此事故。	Also, all good thoughts are by nature free of delusion and grasping, are associated with faith, etc., and are in accord with the understanding of nonself. They are the expedient means that precede the two contemplations of emptiness. It is impossible for the grasping of dharmas to guide the contemplation of the emptiness of dharmas, because the grasping of self has never been seen to do this.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b22_19']	是故有漏無漏善心，決定不與二執無明愛等相應，違教理故。	是故有漏無漏善心，決定不與二執無明愛等相應，違教理故。	Therefore, impure and pure good thoughts are definitely not associated with the ignorance, craving, etc., of the two graspings, because this contradicts teachings and reason.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b24_7']	一切異熟無記心品亦無法執及無明等，分別力劣不能執故。	一切異熟無記心品亦無法執及無明等，分別力劣不能執故。	Also, classes of indeterminate thoughts that are retribution do not have the grasping of dharmas or ignorance, etc., because the power of discrimination is weak and cannot grasp.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b26_5']	若有倒執成法我見，有無明等阿賴耶識，不應唯與五法相應，見無明等慧等攝故。	若有倒執成法我見，有無明等阿賴耶識，不應唯與五法相應，見無明等慧等攝故。	If there is an inverted attachment that constitutes a view of a self in dharmas, and if there is ignorance, etc., the store consciousness must not be associated only with the five dharmas, because views, ignorance, etc., are included in discernment, etc.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b28_3']	又若此識有法執者，無所熏故應念念失，不須對治則成大過，煩惱障中無此事故。	又若此識有法執者，無所熏故應念念失，不須對治則成大過，煩惱障中無此事故。	Also, if this consciousness has a grasping of dharmas, it must be lost at every moment because it has nothing to perfume it, and it would not be necessary to eliminate it, which would be a serious error. This is because the obstacle of the passions does not have this kind of loss.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323b29_6']	又法空觀初現前時，此識應斷，障治相違不俱行故。	又法空觀初現前時，此識應斷，障治相違不俱行故。	Also, when the contemplation of the emptiness of dharmas first appears, this consciousness must be eliminated, because the obstacle and its antidote are incompatible and do not coexist.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323c02_18']	若爾所餘有漏種子應無所依，所修功德應無熏習，無所熏故，不可說言熏習鏡智，相應淨識非無記故，猶未得故。	若爾所餘有漏種子應無所依，所修功德應無熏習，無所熏故，不可說言熏習鏡智，相應淨識非無記故，猶未得故。	If this is so, the remaining impure seeds must have no support, and the cultivated merits must have no perfuming, because there is nothing to perfume them. It cannot be said that they perfume mirror wisdom, because the pure consciousness associated with it is not indeterminate, and it has not yet been acquired.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323c04_7']	阿賴耶識既無法執，餘轉識中異熟果者，亦應如是，性類同故。	阿賴耶識既無法執，餘轉識中異熟果者，亦應如是，性類同故。	Since the store consciousness has no grasping of dharmas, the other evolving consciousnesses that are results of retribution must be the same way, because their natures are the same.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323c05_10']	於五識中亦無法執，無有猛利分別用故，不推求故。	於五識中亦無法執，無有猛利分別用故，不推求故。	Also, there is no grasping of dharmas among the five consciousnesses, because they do as they are stimulated and do not have the function of intense discrimination, and because they do not seek.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323c06_4']	《攝大乘》說，能遍計心唯是意識。	《攝大乘》說，能遍計心唯是意識。	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says that the mind that is able to imagine is only mental consciousness.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323c08_2']	故知五識不緣遍計所執自性，如無分別無推求見，不能計我，故亦不能計度諸法。	故知五識不緣遍計所執自性，如無分別無推求見，不能計我，故亦不能計度諸法。	Therefore, it is known that the five consciousnesses do not have as objects the self-natures imagined by the imagination, because, like the absence of discrimination, they do not have the view that seeks. They are unable to imagine a self, and therefore they are also unable to imagine dharmas.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0323c11_7']	然由意識計我計法起愛恚等，引五識中非見所攝愛恚等起，雖無有見而有愛恚無明等法二障所攝，是故二執分別推求，唯在第六第七意識。	然由意識計我計法起愛恚等，引五識中非見所攝愛恚等起，雖無有見而有愛恚無明等法二障所攝，是故二執分別推求，唯在第六第七意識。	However, as a result of mental consciousness imagining a self and imagining dharmas, love, hatred, etc., are produced, and these in turn attract love, hatred, etc., that are not categorized as views among the five consciousnesses. Even though there are no views, there are the dharmas of love, hatred, and delusion, etc., categorized as the two kinds of obstacles. Therefore, the two kinds of grasping, discrimination, and seeking exist only in the sixth and seventh mental consciousnesses.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0325c29_5']	又前五法攝三身者，有義前二攝自性身，中間二種攝受用身，成所作智攝變化身，經說真如是法身故。	又前五法攝三身者，有義前二攝自性身，中間二種攝受用身，成所作智攝變化身，經說真如是法身故。	As for the five dharmas subsuming the three bodies, there is an interpretation that the first two subsume the essence body, the two in the middle subsume the enjoyment body, and the knowledge of accomplishing activities subsumes the transformation body, because a scripture says that suchness is the Dharma body.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a01_17']	論說轉去阿賴耶識得自性身，大圓鏡智轉第八得，故知前二攝自性身。	論說轉去阿賴耶識得自性身，大圓鏡智轉第八得，故知前二攝自性身。	A treatise says that one turns away from the ālaya consciousness and obtains the essence body, and that the great, perfect mirror knowledge turns the eighth consciousness and obtains it. Therefore the first two subsume the essence body.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a04_8']	此經中說，成所作智起諸化業，《莊嚴論》說，成所作智於一切界發起種種無量難思諸變化事，故知後一攝變化身。	此經中說，成所作智起諸化業，《莊嚴論》說，成所作智於一切界發起種種無量難思諸變化事，故知後一攝變化身。	This scripture says that the action of producing transformations is the work of the knowledge of achieving the task. The Mahāyāna Sūtrālaṃkāra says that the knowledge of achieving the task produces in all realms innumerable and unthinkably various transformations. Therefore we know that the last of the four knowledges includes the body of transformation.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a05_15']	平等性智如餘論說，能於淨土隨諸菩薩所樂示現種種佛身。	平等性智如餘論說，能於淨土隨諸菩薩所樂示現種種佛身。	The knowledge of sameness, as other treatises say, is able to manifest in the pure land the various bodies of buddhas in accordance with the aspirations of the bodhisattvas.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a08_8']	又說轉去諸轉識故得受用身，故知中二攝受用身。	又說轉去諸轉識故得受用身，故知中二攝受用身。	Also, it is said that the enjoyment body is obtained by the transmutation of the evolving consciousnesses. Therefore we know that the middle two knowledges include the enjoyment body.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a09_12']	又佛三身皆十義中智殊勝攝，故知三身皆得有智。	又佛三身皆十義中智殊勝攝，故知三身皆得有智。	Also, the ten aspects of the excellence of knowledge include all three bodies of a buddha. Therefore we know that all three bodies are endowed with knowledge.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a11_10']	有義初一攝自性身，四智自性相應共有，及為地上菩薩所現一分細相，攝受用身；	有義初一攝自性身，四智自性相應共有，及為地上菩薩所現一分細相，攝受用身；	There is an interpretation that the first of the four knowledges includes the essential body, which is the essence of the four knowledges, the associated mental functions, the coexisting dharmas, and the subtle characteristics that are manifested for bodhisattvas on the grounds of the ten stages. It includes the enjoyment body.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a12_13']	若為地前諸菩薩等所現一分麁相化用，攝變化身。	若為地前諸菩薩等所現一分麁相化用，攝變化身。	If it is the manifestation of a part of the coarse characteristics of transformation for bodhisattvas below the grounds, it is included in the transformation body.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a14_2']	《讚佛論》說，如來法身無生滅故。	《讚佛論》說，如來法身無生滅故。	The Treatise on Praising the Buddha says that the Dharma body of the Tathāgata is without arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a14_18']	《莊嚴論》說，佛自性身本性常故。	《莊嚴論》說，佛自性身本性常故。	The Treatise on the Adornment of the Mahāyāna says that the essence body of the Buddha is inherently permanent.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a16_13']	於佛法身為證得因，於餘二身為生因故。	於佛法身為證得因，於餘二身為生因故。	is the cause for realizing the Dharma body of the Buddha and the cause for producing the other two bodies.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a18_15']	諸經論說，究竟轉依以為法身，轉依即是清淨真如非對治道，故知法身唯淨法界真如為性。	諸經論說，究竟轉依以為法身，轉依即是清淨真如非對治道，故知法身唯淨法界真如為性。	The sūtras and treatises say that the ultimate transformation basis is the Dharma body. The transformation basis is precisely pure suchness, not the path of elimination. Therefore, we know that the Dharma body is only the nature of the pure realm of reality and suchness.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a19_10']	《莊嚴論》說，大圓鏡智是受用佛。	《莊嚴論》說，大圓鏡智是受用佛。	The Treatise on the Adornment of the Mahāyāna says that the great perfect mirror cognition is the enjoyment Buddha.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a20_4']	《攝大乘》說，轉諸轉識得受用身。	《攝大乘》說，轉諸轉識得受用身。	The Compendium of the Great Vehicle says that by transforming the various evolving consciousnesses one attains the enjoyment body.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a22_16']	然說轉去阿賴耶識得法身者，此說轉去第八識中二障種子，顯得清淨轉依法身，非說鏡智，以說鏡智是受用故。	然說轉去阿賴耶識得法身者，此說轉去第八識中二障種子，顯得清淨轉依法身，非說鏡智，以說鏡智是受用故。	However, when it is said that one turns away from the store consciousness and obtains the Dharma body, this means that one turns away from the seeds of the two obstacles in the eighth consciousness and manifests the pure transmutation of the support, the Dharma body. It does not mean mirror knowledge, because it is said that mirror knowledge is the body of enjoyment.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a23_5']	又受用身略有二種：	又受用身略有二種：	Also, the body of enjoyment is of two kinds:
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a23_20']	一、自受用，三無數劫修所成故；	一、自受用，三無數劫修所成故；	one is the enjoyment for oneself, because it is perfected through the cultivation of three incalculable eons;
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a24_14']	二、他受用，為諸菩薩受法樂故。	二、他受用，為諸菩薩受法樂故。	the second is the enjoyment for others, because it enjoys the Dharma for the sake of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a25_11']	是故四智相應共有及一分化為受用身。	是故四智相應共有及一分化為受用身。	Therefore, the four knowledges, their common essence, and a part of the transformation body are the body of enjoyment.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a26_10']	經論皆說，化身為化地前眾生現種種相。	經論皆說，化身為化地前眾生現種種相。	Both the scriptures and the treatises say that the transformation body manifests various images in order to transform beings below the stage of the ten understandings.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326a27_15']	既是地前眾生境界，故知非是真實功德，但是化用。	既是地前眾生境界，故知非是真實功德，但是化用。	Since it is the realm of beings below the ten stages, you should realize that it is not a real, true merit but is a transformation and utilization.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b01_16']	經論唯說成所作智能起化業非即化身，雖三種身智殊勝攝，法身是智所依證故，化身是智所起用故，似智現故假說為智，亦無有過。	經論唯說成所作智能起化業非即化身，雖三種身智殊勝攝，法身是智所依證故，化身是智所起用故，似智現故假說為智，亦無有過。	The scriptures and treatises say only that the knowledge of achieving the task can produce the work of transformation and is not itself the transformation body. Although the three bodies are included in the superior knowledge, the Dharma body is the support and realization of knowledge, the transformation body is the function produced by knowledge, and it is said metaphorically that it is knowledge because it appears resembling knowledge.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b02_18']	如是三身受用變化既有生滅，云何經說諸佛身常？	如是三身受用變化既有生滅，云何經說諸佛身常？	In this way, the enjoyment body and transformation body are born and perish, so how can the scriptures say that the bodies of buddhas are permanent?
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b03_8']	由二所依法身常故。	由二所依法身常故。	Because the Dharma body, which is the support of the other two, is permanent.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b06_6']	又受用身及變化身雖有生滅，以恒受用種種法樂無休廢故，於十方界數數現化無斷絕故，如常受樂，如常施食，故說名常。	又受用身及變化身雖有生滅，以恒受用種種法樂無休廢故，於十方界數數現化無斷絕故，如常受樂，如常施食，故說名常。	Also, even though the enjoyment body and the transformation body are born and perish, they are called permanent because the enjoyment of the various kinds of bliss of the Dharma is uninterrupted and because the repeated manifestation of transformation bodies in the ten directions is unceasing, just as one speaks of the enjoyment of permanent bliss and the bestowal of permanent food.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b06_18']	《莊嚴論》說，常有三種：	《莊嚴論》說，常有三種：	The Mahāyāna Sūtrālaṃkāra says, Permanence is of three kinds:
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b07_15']	一、本性常，謂自性身，此身本來性常住故；	一、本性常，謂自性身，此身本來性常住故；	1) permanence by nature, that is, the essential body, because this body is permanent by nature from the beginning.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b08_15']	二、不斷常，謂受用身，恒受法樂無間斷故；	二、不斷常，謂受用身，恒受法樂無間斷故；	Second, uninterrupted permanence refers to the enjoyment body, because it constantly experiences the bliss of the Dharma without interruption.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b09_15']	三、相續常，謂變化身，沒已復現化無盡故。	三、相續常，謂變化身，沒已復現化無盡故。	Third, continuous permanence refers to the transformation body, because after disappearing it manifests again, transforming without end.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b10_18']	如是法身雖離一切分別戲論而無生滅，故說名常。	如是法身雖離一切分別戲論而無生滅，故說名常。	Thus, although the Dharma body is free from all discrimination and disputation, it is said to be permanent because it is unborn and unceasing.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b12_7']	二身雖有念念生滅，而依常身無間斷故，恒相續故說名為常。	二身雖有念念生滅，而依常身無間斷故，恒相續故說名為常。	Although the two bodies are born and perish moment by moment, they are said to be permanent because they rely on the eternal body without interruption and because they are constantly continuous.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b15_14']	經說如來色受等法一切常住，依此道理非無生滅，無漏種子修習增長所生起故，生者皆滅一向記故，色心皆見是無常故，常住色心曾不見故。	經說如來色受等法一切常住，依此道理非無生滅，無漏種子修習增長所生起故，生者皆滅一向記故，色心皆見是無常故，常住色心曾不見故。	The sūtras say that the Tathāgata's form, feelings, and other dharmas are all permanently abiding. Based on this principle, they are not without birth and cessation, because they arise from the cultivation and growth of the pure seeds, because they are unilaterally predicted to perish once born, and because form and mind are all seen to be impermanent, while form and mind that permanently abide have never been seen.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b16_9']	如是三身，云何形量？	如是三身，云何形量？	How are the dimensions of these three bodies?

Suchness is precisely the true nature of all dharmas. Since dharmas are boundless, the Dharma body is also thus, pervading all dharmas without being absent anywhere.

Since the formless dharmas have no shape or substance, one also cannot speak of their size or dimensions. If one speaks in terms of the body it relies on and the objects of cognition it knows, one can say it pervades everywhere.

One transforms the five sense organs and so forth, which are the tainted form body, and attains the Buddha's untainted five sense organs and so forth, adorned with innumerable excellent characteristics. The body pervades the Dharma realm and is the true pure land.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b26_17']	於生死中業有分限，阿賴耶識所變身形大小不定，且如此界。	於生死中業有分限，阿賴耶識所變身形大小不定，且如此界。	In samsara, karma has a limited function, and the size of the body transformed by the store consciousness is not fixed. In this world,
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326b27_16']	贍部洲人善業最劣，所得色身極長四肘；	贍部洲人善業最劣，所得色身極長四肘；	the people of Jambudvīpa have the worst karma, and the bodies they obtain are at most four cubits long.

['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326c03_7']	十地菩薩無漏善根所資熏故，身形轉大，如經廣說。	十地菩薩無漏善根所資熏故，身形轉大，如經廣說。	Because the uncontaminated roots of goodness of bodhisattvas in the ten stages are nourished and perfumed, their bodies become larger and larger, as is explained in detail in the scriptures.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326c05_4']	金剛喻定現在前時，滅一切障，善根勢力量無邊故，所得色身充滿法界遍實淨土。	金剛喻定現在前時，滅一切障，善根勢力量無邊故，所得色身充滿法界遍實淨土。	When the diamond-like samādhi is present, it destroys all obstacles, and because the power of the roots of goodness is limitless, the bodies obtained fill the Dharma realm and pervade the pure lands.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326c06_3']	大圓鏡智相應淨識，所變身土無限量故。	大圓鏡智相應淨識，所變身土無限量故。	This is because the bodies and lands transformed by the pure consciousness associated with the great perfect mirror cognition are limitless in size.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326c08_14']	諸佛識變同處同時，其相相似不相障礙，盡未來際無間無斷，依此能令諸佛受用廣大喜樂，是故說名受用身土。	諸佛識變同處同時，其相相似不相障礙，盡未來際無間無斷，依此能令諸佛受用廣大喜樂，是故說名受用身土。	The transformations of consciousness of all buddhas are in the same place at the same time, their characteristics are similar, and they do not obstruct each other. They last until the end of time without interruption or cessation. On the basis of this, all buddhas are able to experience vast, great, joyful pleasures. Therefore it is said that the body and land of enjoyment are the body and land of enjoyment.
['ZH_T26_1530_007:0326c12_2']	如是身土唯佛乃知，非諸菩薩五根所證，一一色根能證一切所受境界無障礙故，是故諸佛無見頂相、無邊法音，一切色根作用無限，以遍滿故。	如是身土唯佛乃知，非諸菩薩五根所證，一一色根能證一切所受境界無障礙故，是故諸佛無見頂相、無邊法音，一切色根作用無限，以遍滿故。	This body and land are known only to buddhas and are not realized by the five sense organs of bodhisattvas, because each sense organ is able to realize all the objects experienced without obstruction. Therefore buddhas have no visible crown protuberance, no boundless Dharma sounds, and the functioning of all their sense organs is unlimited, because they are all-pervading.

It is both form and nonform. The nonform is the transformation of the mental activity of the Tathāgata, consisting of the characteristics of the powers, fearlessnesses, and other qualities. It is without form and size because it is without material form. The form is the transformation of the bodily and verbal activities of the Tathāgata. It appears in accordance with the time, place, and needs of the assembly. The size of the body that is manifested is not fixed, as is explained in detail in the scriptures.

However, they are said to be nondifferent because they are the same in place, similar, and equal in the intention to benefit and gladden and in their activities.

Therefore, when the Tathāgata was Tiṣya Buddha, he was once a disciple of Maitreya. The Buddha observed that the roots of good of those sentient beings to be converted by Śākyamuni were ripe first, while the roots of good of those to be converted by Maitreya were ripe later. He also observed that the causes and practices of Maitreya were fulfilled first, while those of Śākyamuni were fulfilled later. He then entered the samādhi of firelight in one place, causing Śākyamuni to see him and not lower his foot or praise him with a verse for seven days and seven nights, causing him to surpass Maitreya and become a Buddha first.

The Buddha should also not transform other sentient beings to enter the Great Vehicle, because it would be useless. He should only transform them to attain the Three Vehicles and enter into permanent quiescence, because that is easier to attain.
