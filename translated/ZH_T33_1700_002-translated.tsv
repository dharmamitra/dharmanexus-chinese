['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146b19_9']	當知地前菩薩未生如來家故，雖是佛子，稍疎遠故，不名紹佛種也。	當知地前菩薩未生如來家故，雖是佛子，稍疎遠故，不名紹佛種也。	One should know that bodhisattvas below the grounds have not yet been born into the Tathāgata's family, and although they are the Buddha's disciples, they are somewhat distant, and are therefore not called the Buddha's lineage.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146b21_2']	二乘人雖亦佛子，但求自利，亦非堪紹故，《攝論》說聲聞人如無智婢子也。	二乘人雖亦佛子，但求自利，亦非堪紹故，《攝論》說聲聞人如無智婢子也。	Although the two vehicles are also the Buddha's disciples, they only seek their own benefit, and are also not capable of continuing the Buddha's lineage. The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says that śrāvakas are like ignorant maidservants.

['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146b26_12']	論云，若於此家長夜願生，既得生已，便得彼身，是名妙身者，謂地前菩薩為此家長夜精懃欲願故，得入初地，便得妙身也。	論云，若於此家長夜願生，既得生已，便得彼身，是名妙身者，謂地前菩薩為此家長夜精懃欲願故，得入初地，便得妙身也。	The treatise says, If one has long wished to be born in this family, and after being born, one obtains that body, this is called a wonderful body. This means that bodhisattvas below the grounds, due to their long night of diligent aspiration for this family, attain entry into the first ground and then obtain a wonderful body.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146b28_20']	平等智復有五種平等因緣，謂一者、麁惡平等，謂入初地已，女人身、第八有、三惡趣竝已捨故，總皆平等也。	平等智復有五種平等因緣，謂一者、麁惡平等，謂入初地已，女人身、第八有、三惡趣竝已捨故，總皆平等也。	The equality wisdom also has five kinds of causes of equality, namely: first, the equality of coarseness and evil, meaning that after entering the first ground, the female body, eighth existence, and three evil destinies are all abandoned, and thus are all equal.

This means that if there are no bodhisattvas, there should also be no bodhi to be attained by bodhisattvas;
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146c15_5']	若無眾生者，教化誰令入於涅槃？	若無眾生者，教化誰令入於涅槃？	If there are no sentient beings, then who are we teaching and transforming to enter nirvana?

['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146c18_16']	為實無眾生等，故佛不見耶？	為實無眾生等，故佛不見耶？	Is it because there really are no sentient beings, etc. that the Buddha does not see?

['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146c22_11']	一者、若無菩薩，諸佛亦不成菩提；	一者、若無菩薩，諸佛亦不成菩提；	First, if there were no bodhisattvas, buddhas would also not attain enlightenment;

['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146c26_12']	此意云，若菩薩執云，我得菩提，有異眾生可度，即不名菩薩，以有我、人等故；	此意云，若菩薩執云，我得菩提，有異眾生可度，即不名菩薩，以有我、人等故；	This meaning says, if a bodhisattva grasps, I attain enlightenment, there are sentient beings different from me to be liberated, then they are not called bodhisattvas, because they have a self, a person, and so forth;
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146c27_2']	若爾者，如何能得菩提？	若爾者，如何能得菩提？	If that is so, then how can they attain enlightenment?
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0146c27_11']	能令眾生入涅槃耶？	能令眾生入涅槃耶？	Can they cause sentient beings to enter nirvana?
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a01_6']	謂有假眾生，譬如幻人為幻人說法故，謂有五蘊和合假眾生故，令得無餘涅槃，無如所執實眾生故，不見有眾生而滅度也。	謂有假眾生，譬如幻人為幻人說法故，謂有五蘊和合假眾生故，令得無餘涅槃，無如所執實眾生故，不見有眾生而滅度也。	It is said that there are provisionally existent sentient beings, for example, like an illusory person expounding the Dharma for an illusory person. Because there are the five aggregates coming together as a provisionally existent sentient being, they can attain nirvāṇa without remainder. Because there are no truly existent sentient beings as grasped, one does not see any sentient beings to be liberated.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a02_18']	謂有假菩薩而求證故，諸佛得菩提，而無所執實菩提，故亦無菩薩也。	謂有假菩薩而求證故，諸佛得菩提，而無所執實菩提，故亦無菩薩也。	It means that there is a provisional bodhisattva who seeks to realize it, but the buddhas attain enlightenment without grasping at real enlightenment, and therefore there is also no bodhisattva.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a04_10']	故《涅槃經》十三云，五陰和合，稱言某甲，凡夫之人謂為實有，稱言某甲；	故《涅槃經》十三云，五陰和合，稱言某甲，凡夫之人謂為實有，稱言某甲；	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra, fascicle 13, says, The combination of the five aggregates is called so-and-so. Ordinary people consider it to be truly existent and call it so-and-so;
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a05_15']	有智之人解陰無有某甲名字，離陰亦無有某甲名字也。	有智之人解陰無有某甲名字，離陰亦無有某甲名字也。	People with wisdom understand that the aggregates do not have the name so-and-so, and apart from the aggregates, there is also no name so-and-so.

['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a10_12']	法既無有其實，亦無所成菩薩也。	法既無有其實，亦無所成菩薩也。	Since the dharmas do not have any reality, there are also no formed bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a12_8']	「佛說一切法無我、人」等者，證真時，達無我理，不見有人、法二執，故是為菩薩也。	「佛說一切法無我、人」等者，證真時，達無我理，不見有人、法二執，故是為菩薩也。	The Buddha said that all dharmas are without self, person, etc. When realizing the truth, one penetrates the principle of no-self and does not see the two attachments to person and dharmas, therefore it is for the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a13_15']	無著云，上來譬如人身妙、大身等示入證道，此為第二明離慢。	無著云，上來譬如人身妙、大身等示入證道，此為第二明離慢。	Asanga says, above it is like a person's body being wonderful and great, etc., demonstrating entry into the path of realization. This is the second point, clarifying the abandonment of conceit.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a14_13']	謂地前言，我能修行等，而障不住道；	謂地前言，我能修行等，而障不住道；	It is said that on the grounds one thinks, I can practice, etc., and this obstructs abiding in the path;
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a16_9']	入地已去，證達法界二空平等，分別我、法一切都亡，永無我能之慢，故云離慢也。	入地已去，證達法界二空平等，分別我、法一切都亡，永無我能之慢，故云離慢也。	Having entered the grounds and above, one realizes and penetrates the dharma realm, the equality of the two emptinesses, and all discrimination of self and dharmas is completely gone, forever without the conceit of I can, therefore it is said to be the abandonment of conceit.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a18_10']	論云，「若菩薩有眾生念，則不得妙身、大身故」，「於中妙身者，謂至得身成就，身得畢竟轉依故；	論云，「若菩薩有眾生念，則不得妙身、大身故」，「於中妙身者，謂至得身成就，身得畢竟轉依故；	The treatise says, If the bodhisattva has the thought of sentient beings, then he cannot attain the wonderful body and the great body. Among them, the wonderful body refers to attaining the body, accomplishing the body, and attaining the ultimate transformation of the basis;
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a19_4']	大身者，一切眾生身攝身故」。	大身者，一切眾生身攝身故」。	The great body refers to the body that includes all sentient beings' bodies.

['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a23_9']	於中有二，初、標，次、釋，此初也。	於中有二，初、標，次、釋，此初也。	There are two parts here: first, the thesis, and second, the explanation. This is the first.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a25_8']	此意云，如欲嚴淨佛土，必須嚴淨自心，聽經、學慧、證法真理、蠲除二障，內心淨故，外土亦淨。	此意云，如欲嚴淨佛土，必須嚴淨自心，聽經、學慧、證法真理、蠲除二障，內心淨故，外土亦淨。	The meaning is that if one wishes to adorn and purify the Buddha lands, one must adorn and purify one's own mind. By listening to the sūtras, studying wisdom, realizing the truth of dharmas, and removing the two hindrances, because the inner mind is pure, the outer lands are also pure.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a27_2']	所以蠡髻見淨，舍利覩穢，但由內心有其垢淨不同，外土亦有淨穢兩異也。	所以蠡髻見淨，舍利覩穢，但由內心有其垢淨不同，外土亦有淨穢兩異也。	Therefore, when Śreṇiya saw them as pure and Śāriputra saw them as defiled, it was simply because the inner minds had different degrees of purity and defilement, and the outer lands also had two different aspects of purity and defilement.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147a28_14']	故若嚴淨佛土者，先除我、法二執，我、法分別亡故，內具莊嚴，外住七寶。	故若嚴淨佛土者，先除我、法二執，我、法分別亡故，內具莊嚴，外住七寶。	Therefore, if one wishes to adorn the Buddha-land, one should first eliminate the two attachments to self and dharmas. Because the discrimination of self and dharmas is gone, one is internally adorned and externally abides in the seven treasures.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147b01_6']	若言「我當莊嚴」者，是則我執未亡，不名菩薩也，故論云「智習唯識通」也。	若言「我當莊嚴」者，是則我執未亡，不名菩薩也，故論云「智習唯識通」也。	If one says, I will adorn, then the attachment to self is not yet gone, and one is not called a bodhisattva. Therefore, the treatise says, The wisdom cultivates the thorough understanding of consciousness-only.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0147b01_19']	又《無垢稱》云，心淨故等；	又《無垢稱》云，心淨故等；	Moreover, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra says, Because the mind is pure, and so forth.

Therefore, at the time of receiving and upholding [the teachings], it becomes a vast cause for bodhi, surpassing the merit of giving away immeasurable precious treasures. This directly resolves the previous doubts.

The Hinayana has sixty-two numbers, the Huayan has one hundred and twenty sets of numbers, and this world has fifteen, namely one, ten, hundred, thousand, myriad, and so on. Comparing by these various numbers, one can know all the results and retributions of birth and death.

['ZH_T33_1700_002:0151a28_7']	力勝者，名為情計勝，謂布施等所獲世間人天善果情計可知，今此受、持之因，情計所不計度也。	力勝者，名為情計勝，謂布施等所獲世間人天善果情計可知，今此受、持之因，情計所不計度也。	Superior in power means superior in emotional calculation, referring to the worldly good fruits obtained through giving and so forth, which can be emotionally calculated and known. Now, the cause of upholding and receiving cannot be emotionally calculated.
['ZH_T33_1700_002:0151b01_4']	不相似勝者，謂喻勝也，世間福果喻可能喻，受、持之因所得勝果，無喻以可喻也。	不相似勝者，謂喻勝也，世間福果喻可能喻，受、持之因所得勝果，無喻以可喻也。	Superior in dissimilarity means superior in analogy. The worldly fruits of blessings can be analogized, but the superior fruits obtained from upholding and receiving cannot be analogized.
