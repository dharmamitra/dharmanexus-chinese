['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753a22_0', 'ZH_T36_1739_006:0753a23_0']	長者李通玄撰🔽初地菩薩多百法明門王，化多百佛世界，二	長者李通玄撰 初地菩薩多百法明門王，化多百佛世界，二	Composed by Elder Li Tongxuan
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753a25_16']	地菩薩多千法明門王，化多千佛世界者，不同權教實有分限，如前數法互相徹入。	地菩薩多千法明門王，化多千佛世界者，不同權教實有分限，如前數法互相徹入。	The bodhisattvas of the first ground have many hundreds of Dharma gates, transforming many hundreds of buddha-realms. The bodhisattvas of the second ground have many thousands of Dharma gates, transforming many thousands of buddha-realms. This is different from the limited teachings of the provisional teachings, as the number of dharmas mutually penetrate each other as before.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753a27_10']	又如人以指畫空作百千微塵數，復以手除之令盡，然彼空中無有增減。	又如人以指畫空作百千微塵數，復以手除之令盡，然彼空中無有增減。	Moreover, it is like a person using their finger to draw hundreds of thousands of dust motes in the sky, and then using their hand to remove them all, yet the space in the sky neither increases nor decreases.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753a28_4']	以情量故，見彼虛空數有增減。	以情量故，見彼虛空數有增減。	Because of conceptual measurement, one sees the number of dust motes in the sky as increasing and decreasing.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753a29_7']	此亦爾，所有菩薩安立諸地法門增減，亦復如是。	此亦爾，所有菩薩安立諸地法門增減，亦復如是。	This is also so. The increase and decrease of the Dharma gates established by the bodhisattvas in the various grounds is also like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b01_10']	為成諸有情故使令進修，若也一概皆平，無心進也。	為成諸有情故使令進修，若也一概皆平，無心進也。	It is for the sake of perfecting sentient beings that they are caused to progress in cultivation. If they were all equal, there would be no mind to progress.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b02_14']	凡夫無有進修之心，發心修至不修，方知萬法無修也。	凡夫無有進修之心，發心修至不修，方知萬法無修也。	Ordinary beings have no mind to progress in cultivation. Whether one gives rise to the mind to cultivate or not, only then does one know that the myriad dharmas are without cultivation.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b04_16']	而實教菩薩一得一切得，為稱法體中無前後故，猶如帝網光影互相參徹相入，無前後際也。	而實教菩薩一得一切得，為稱法體中無前後故，猶如帝網光影互相參徹相入，無前後際也。	However, in the real teaching, bodhisattvas attain all at once, in accordance with the principle that there is no sequence in the essence of phenomena. It is like the lights and shadows in the emperor's net, mutually penetrating and interpenetrating, without any sequence.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b06_3']	亦如百千寶鏡同臨妙像，一一鏡中影像相入色像齊平。	亦如百千寶鏡同臨妙像，一一鏡中影像相入色像齊平。	It is also like hundreds of thousands of precious mirrors reflecting a wonderful image, with the reflections of each mirror interpenetrating and the colors and forms being the same.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b07_13']	如佛果位中諸菩薩，為從性起法身根本智，為十住之中創證心故。	如佛果位中諸菩薩，為從性起法身根本智，為十住之中創證心故。	Just as in the stage of buddhahood, the bodhisattvas arise from the fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body based on their nature, and initially realize the mind within the ten abodes.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b08_15']	所有法門境界皆悉依本，以體用通收皆悉徹故。	所有法門境界皆悉依本，以體用通收皆悉徹故。	All the Dharma gates and realms are based on the original essence, because the essence and function are completely included and penetrate through.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b09_6']	還以性齊，即時齊故。	還以性齊，即時齊故。	They are still equal to the nature, because the time is the same.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b09_19']	更有餘不齊之法，為不可也。	更有餘不齊之法，為不可也。	There cannot be any other dharmas that are not equal.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b12_4']	不同權學情障未亡，九地已來未見佛性，所立地位皆有分齊而實可得，為未見佛性，有假真如影故。	不同權學情障未亡，九地已來未見佛性，所立地位皆有分齊而實可得，為未見佛性，有假真如影故。	It is different from the provisional teachings where the emotional hindrances of sentient beings have not yet been eliminated. Those below the ninth ground have not yet seen the buddha-nature, and the stages they establish all have boundaries that can be attained, because they have not yet seen the buddha-nature and have only the shadow of the provisional true suchness.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b12_20']	是故經云「十地差別如空中鳥跡」。	是故經云「十地差別如空中鳥跡」。	Therefore, the sutra says, The distinctions of the ten grounds are like bird tracks in the sky.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b13_16']	如地位法門權施增減，為逐眾生情故。	如地位法門權施增減，為逐眾生情故。	The Dharma gates of the stages and grounds are provisionally established with increases and decreases, in order to follow the dispositions of sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b14_18']	體道者真俗便真，為一真一切真故，都無假法。	體道者真俗便真，為一真一切真故，都無假法。	For those who realize the truth, the conventional and the real are simply the real, because one truth is all truths, so there are no provisional dharmas at all.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b15_14']	不可於此圓教作增減見，同其漸也。	不可於此圓教作增減見，同其漸也。	One should not view increases and decreases in this perfect teaching, the same as in the gradual [approach].
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b18_13']	此經所有一切眾海菩薩、天龍諸神等眾，皆佛果位海諸菩薩眾，非是凡夫，欲令入者即同聖故，明毘盧遮那攝化境界等眾生遍故。	此經所有一切眾海菩薩、天龍諸神等眾，皆佛果位海諸菩薩眾，非是凡夫，欲令入者即同聖故，明毘盧遮那攝化境界等眾生遍故。	All the multitudes of bodhisattvas and devas, dragons, spirits, etc. in this sutra are the multitudes of bodhisattvas in the ocean of the Buddha's fruition stage, not ordinary beings. It is to cause those who wish to enter to be the same as the sages, clarifying that Vairocana's realm of embracing and transforming is as pervasive as sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b19_8']	皆是佛果位眾，以化儀主伴故。	皆是佛果位眾，以化儀主伴故。	They are all the multitudes in the Buddha's fruition stage, because they are the host and companions of the transformative methods.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b20_4']	如是果德位眾共會成法，示悟眾生。	如是果德位眾共會成法，示悟眾生。	In this way, the multitudes in the fruition stage gather together to form the Dharma, demonstrating and awakening sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b22_5']	成法之後入〈法界品〉中，文殊師利以此果德法門出祇園會外，東行欲往覺城中利樂於人。	成法之後入〈法界品〉中，文殊師利以此果德法門出祇園會外，東行欲往覺城中利樂於人。	After completing the Dharma, they entered the Chapter on the Dharma Realm. Mañjuśrī, with this fruition-based Dharma door, left the Jeta Grove and went east, wishing to go to the city of awakening to benefit others.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b23_4']	舍利弗、六千比丘路上發心，得十耳十眼。	舍利弗、六千比丘路上發心，得十耳十眼。	Śāriputra and six thousand bhikṣus generated the aspiration for enlightenment on the road and attained the ten ears and ten eyes.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b24_3']	覺城東會善財，遍求諸友，一生佛果圓明。	覺城東會善財，遍求諸友，一生佛果圓明。	To the east of the city of awakening, Mañjuśrī met Sudhana and sought out various friends, perfecting the fruition of one lifetime.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b26_5']	五百優婆塞、五百優婆夷、五百童子、五百童女皆如善財，經文不可一一具陳，同會總皆如是。	五百優婆塞、五百優婆夷、五百童子、五百童女皆如善財，經文不可一一具陳，同會總皆如是。	Five hundred upāsakas, five hundred upāsikās, five hundred young men, and five hundred young women were all like Sudhana. The sūtra text cannot list them all one by one. They all gathered together in the same way.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b28_1']	若也無緣，總亦不聞，如祇園羅漢比丘等同會，不聞不見如來說此《華嚴》經典。	若也無緣，總亦不聞，如祇園羅漢比丘等同會，不聞不見如來說此《華嚴》經典。	If there is no affinity, they will not hear it at all. It is like the arhat bhikṣus in the Jeta Grove who gathered together but did not hear or see the Tathāgata expound this Flower Ornament Sutra.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b29_3']	是五眾同會於文殊所，同聞此法，悉皆同證之流。	是五眾同會於文殊所，同聞此法，悉皆同證之流。	These five groups gathered together in the presence of Mañjuśrī, heard this Dharma together, and all realized it together.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753b29_18']	是故經云「此經不入餘眾生手」。	是故經云「此經不入餘眾生手」。	Therefore, the sūtra says, This sūtra does not fall into the hands of other sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c01_17']	能深信者，情過三乘權學之流，何況能證者。	能深信者，情過三乘權學之流，何況能證者。	Those who can deeply believe in it are those whose feelings surpass those of the provisional learners of the three vehicles, let alone those who are able to realize it.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c04_1']	故此經〈賢首品〉中云「一切世間群生類，尠有欲求聲聞乘，求緣覺者轉復少，求大乘者甚希有。	故此經〈賢首品〉中云「一切世間群生類，尠有欲求聲聞乘，求緣覺者轉復少，求大乘者甚希有。	Therefore, in the Chapter on the Foremost of Worthies of this sutra, it says, Among the multitudes of living beings in all worlds, few aspire to the Śrāvaka Vehicle, those who aspire to the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle are even fewer, and those who aspire to the Great Vehicle are extremely rare.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c04_17']	求大乘者猶為易，能信此法為甚難。	求大乘者猶為易，能信此法為甚難。	Those who aspire to the Great Vehicle are still considered easy, but being able to believe in this Dharma is extremely difficult.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c06_10']	」是故當知，正集海會，未有人中凡夫，純是諸佛果位菩薩集會，成其教法。	」是故當知，正集海會，未有人中凡夫，純是諸佛果位菩薩集會，成其教法。	Therefore, one should know that in the assembly of the ocean-like congregation, there were no ordinary people among humans, but only bodhisattvas of the fruition stage of the buddhas gathered, forming their teaching.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c07_13']	文殊覺城所化，始明以此教法將用利藥閻浮提眾生。	文殊覺城所化，始明以此教法將用利藥閻浮提眾生。	Mañjuśrī's transformation in the city of awakening initially clarified using this teaching to benefit the sentient beings of Jambudvīpa.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c08_16']	善財等五眾，總表實得此法者，餘義如前所明。	善財等五眾，總表實得此法者，餘義如前所明。	The five assemblies such as Sudhana collectively represent those who truly attain this Dharma. The other meanings are as explained above.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c11_1']	如是來眾純是果位菩薩來，明果德用備上機，都無權教菩薩小乘人天凡夫因果等眾來集此會。	如是來眾純是果位菩薩來，明果德用備上機，都無權教菩薩小乘人天凡夫因果等眾來集此會。	Such an assembly of comers is purely composed of bodhisattvas in the stage of fruition, manifesting the complete fruition virtues and superior capacities. There is no assembly of bodhisattvas of provisional teachings, disciples of the two vehicles, or ordinary beings of the five turbidities coming to this assembly.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c12_2']	權教菩薩至於九地已來不預此眾，何況凡夫。	權教菩薩至於九地已來不預此眾，何況凡夫。	Bodhisattvas of provisional teachings, up to the ninth stage, are not included in this assembly, let alone ordinary beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c12_6']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c12_14']	為行六波羅蜜故。	為行六波羅蜜故。	It is because they practice the six perfections.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c14_12']	雖有行十波羅蜜者，由三僧祇劫成道果德故，不同此教一時即一切時，非情所收故。	雖有行十波羅蜜者，由三僧祇劫成道果德故，不同此教一時即一切時，非情所收故。	Although there are those who practice the ten perfections, because they attain the fruition of enlightenment in three incalculable eons, it is different from this teaching where one instant is all instants, and therefore not included in the realm of sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c16_14']	出祇園會，文殊東行，六千比丘路上發心者，此明許聲聞亦有最上之器，堪能入此最上乘中。	出祇園會，文殊東行，六千比丘路上發心者，此明許聲聞亦有最上之器，堪能入此最上乘中。	Leaving the Jeta Grove, Manjushri went east, and six thousand bhikshus generated the resolve on the road. This shows that it is permitted for shravakas to also have the supreme vessel, and they are able to enter this supreme vehicle.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c18_12']	又彼六千比丘，於舍利弗所皆新出家，未忻小果，以器利故，方能發心至此位流。	又彼六千比丘，於舍利弗所皆新出家，未忻小果，以器利故，方能發心至此位流。	Moreover, those six thousand bhikshus had all newly left the household life under Shariputra, and had not yet delighted in the lesser fruition. Because their vessels were sharp, they were able to generate the resolve and reach this stage of the stream-enterer.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c19_2']	已登小果，卒迴難得。	已登小果，卒迴難得。	Having already attained the small fruits, it is difficult to suddenly turn back.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c19_20']	如舍利弗，即是影響聲聞，非實聲聞也。	如舍利弗，即是影響聲聞，非實聲聞也。	Like Śāriputra, he is a reflected voice śrāvaka, not a real śrāvaka.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c20_11']	即是已登佛位，入流接凡。	即是已登佛位，入流接凡。	He has already ascended to the Buddha's position and enters the stream to connect with ordinary people.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c21_6']	以此義故，此經來眾與權教不同。	以此義故，此經來眾與權教不同。	For this reason, the assembly in this sūtra is different from that of the provisional teachings.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c22_8']	化佛設有處純會菩薩、無小眾者，亦不同此教。	化佛設有處純會菩薩、無小眾者，亦不同此教。	Even if the transformation Buddha is in a place where there is only a pure assembly of bodhisattvas and no small assembly, it is still different from this teaching.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c22_12']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c22_17']	或有教說。	或有教說。	There are some teachings that say:
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c23_8']	即因成佛者，即不行五位。	即因成佛者，即不行五位。	Those who attain Buddhahood based on this cause do not go through the five stages.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c24_4']	或五位行相體用不同，如前已述故。	或五位行相體用不同，如前已述故。	Or the characteristics of the practice and the essence and function of the five stages are different, as already explained above.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c24_14']	如是准例，無有同者。	如是准例，無有同者。	According to this example, there is nothing the same.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c25_3']	法既不同，眾亦全別。	法既不同，眾亦全別。	Since the Dharma is different, the assembly is also completely different.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c26_7']	又於此經中所有來眾，有十種同法，與諸經來眾不同。	又於此經中所有來眾，有十種同法，與諸經來眾不同。	Moreover, among the assembly in this sūtra, there are ten kinds of the same Dharma that are different from the assembly in other sūtras.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0753c29_15']	一色身同、二法身根本智同、三慈悲智同、四言說法輪同、五來處同、六所成法則同、七與佛因果同、八事佛師弟同、九報身國土圓滿同、十懷疑獲益同。	一色身同、二法身根本智同、三慈悲智同、四言說法輪同、五來處同、六所成法則同、七與佛因果同、八事佛師弟同、九報身國土圓滿同、十懷疑獲益同。	First, the similarity of physical bodies; second, the fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body; third, the wisdom of compassion; fourth, the turning of the Dharma wheel through speech; fifth, the places from which they come; sixth, the methods of accomplishment; seventh, being the same as the causes and effects of the buddhas; eighth, the teacher-disciple relationship with the buddhas; ninth, the perfection of the reward bodies and lands; tenth, the benefit of resolving doubts.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a04_18']	一色身同者，如五位中諸菩薩各從十方來，一一方來眾皆有十佛剎微塵數眾菩薩來，皆金色身、目髮紺青，當位菩薩色身相似，諸天八部之眾當類相似，明得法同故報亦同。	一色身同者，如五位中諸菩薩各從十方來，一一方來眾皆有十佛剎微塵數眾菩薩來，皆金色身、目髮紺青，當位菩薩色身相似，諸天八部之眾當類相似，明得法同故報亦同。	As for the similarity of physical bodies, in the five positions, the bodhisattvas each come from the ten directions. In each direction, the assembly has bodhisattvas from ten buddha-lands' dust-mote-like number of worlds coming. They all have golden-colored bodies, dark-blue eyes and hair. The bodhisattvas in each position have similar physical bodies. The various gods and the eight groups of beings have similar appearances. It is clear that because they attain the same Dharma, their rewards are also the same.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a08_9']	如初會中，有五十五種部類，雖別明行門攝化異故，然其行相身色法門，五十五部互相參徹，一行作多行、多行作一行，一身作多身、多身作一身，相似故。	如初會中，有五十五種部類，雖別明行門攝化異故，然其行相身色法門，五十五部互相參徹，一行作多行、多行作一行，一身作多身、多身作一身，相似故。	As in the first assembly, there are fifty-five kinds of categories, although they clearly explain the different methods of practice and conversion, the characteristics of practice, the bodies, colors, and Dharma gates are mutually penetrating in the fifty-five categories, one practice becomes many practices, many practices become one practice, one body becomes many bodies, many bodies become one body, because they are similar.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a08_18']	前後十處十會例然。	前後十處十會例然。	The ten places and ten assemblies before and after are the same.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a10_14']	二法身根本智同者，如十處十會中所有眾海，皆同如來法性身，本智慧故。	二法身根本智同者，如十處十會中所有眾海，皆同如來法性身，本智慧故。	Second, as for the same fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body, in the ten places and ten assemblies, all the multitudes of beings are the same as the Tathāgata's Dharma nature body, because of the fundamental wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a13_5']	設有新學凡夫入會之者，見聞佛法剎那證入，皆齊如來法性身根本智故，無有入會見聞法者不同佛身智慧者。	設有新學凡夫入會之者，見聞佛法剎那證入，皆齊如來法性身根本智故，無有入會見聞法者不同佛身智慧者。	Even if there are newly studying ordinary beings who enter the assembly, seeing and hearing the Buddha's teachings in an instant they attain entry, all equal to the Tathāgata's Dharma nature body and fundamental wisdom, there is no one who enters the assembly, sees and hears the teachings, who is not the same as the Buddha's body and wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a14_13']	五百羅漢身在會內，不見不聞不知不覺此之大會及所說法門。	五百羅漢身在會內，不見不聞不知不覺此之大會及所說法門。	Five hundred arhats were in the assembly, but they did not see, hear, know, or realize this great assembly and the Dharma gates that were being taught.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a16_1']	不同權教菩薩二乘人天八部，同會見佛，聞法獲益全殊。	不同權教菩薩二乘人天八部，同會見佛，聞法獲益全殊。	Unlike the bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, devas, humans, and the eight classes of beings in the provisional teachings, who gather together to see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and attain benefits, all of which are completely different.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a18_19']	三慈悲智同者，法身本智及差別智，慈悲體同，解行合故，為文殊普賢佛果始終一法故。	三慈悲智同者，法身本智及差別智，慈悲體同，解行合故，為文殊普賢佛果始終一法故。	Third, the sameness of compassion, wisdom, and cognition. The fundamental wisdom of the Dharma body and the wisdom of distinctions have the same essence of compassion. Because understanding and practice are united, they are the one Dharma from beginning to end of the fruition of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a20_13']	如華嚴經三寶者，佛為佛寶、文殊為法寶、普賢為僧寶，是古今佛之舊法故。	如華嚴經三寶者，佛為佛寶、文殊為法寶、普賢為僧寶，是古今佛之舊法故。	As for the Three Jewels in the Huayan Sutra, the Buddha is the Buddha Jewel, Mañjuśrī is the Dharma Jewel, and Samantabhadra is the Saṃgha Jewel. This is because it is the ancient and modern Buddhas' old Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a21_16']	若合，即一切皆同，為本如是故，非造作非成壞故。	若合，即一切皆同，為本如是故，非造作非成壞故。	If united, then all are the same, because the basis is like this, not created, not formed or destroyed.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a24_15']	四言說法輪同者，如經中五位菩薩各十方來，一一方各有十佛剎微塵數菩薩來至此會，十方世界皆悉如是，一時雲集。	四言說法輪同者，如經中五位菩薩各十方來，一一方各有十佛剎微塵數菩薩來至此會，十方世界皆悉如是，一時雲集。	Fourth, the sameness of the Dharma wheel of speech. As in the sutra, the bodhisattvas in the five positions each come from the ten directions. In each direction there are bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in a buddha land who come to this assembly. The worlds in the ten directions are all like this, gathering like clouds at the same time.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a26_3']	異口同音，十方眾海一時說偈，皆同文句、名字恰合，一無差別。	異口同音，十方眾海一時說偈，皆同文句、名字恰合，一無差別。	With different mouths but the same voice, the multitudes of the ten directions spoke verses simultaneously, all with the same words and phrases, matching perfectly, without the slightest difference.
['ZH_T36_1739_006:0754a27_5']	為智慧同、法行同，所說法門十方世界一種皆同。	為智慧同、法行同，所說法門十方世界一種皆同。	This is because their wisdom is the same and their Dharma practices are the same, and the Dharma gates they speak are of one kind throughout the worlds of the ten directions.

The nature and characteristics of the Buddha's body are of one essence and without distinction. The vessels have myriad ends, and the faculties they rely on are each different. When the mind dwells in the separation of characteristics, the view is cut off and the essence is unified. When the body establishes the shadow arises, and when the mind remains the Buddha is different. The Buddha responds to the mind, and because of this the truth is estranged. When the mind ends and the mind is gone, the wisdom body naturally manifests. When wisdom conditions are unconditioned, movement and stillness are both true. Such accord is called the Buddha Vairocana.
