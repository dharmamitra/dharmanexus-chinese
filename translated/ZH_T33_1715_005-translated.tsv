['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c16_0', 'ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c17_0']	光宅沙門法雲撰🔽2譬喻品之餘	光宅沙門法雲撰 2譬喻品之餘	005	Composed by Fayun, a monk from Guangzhai
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c19_15']	「見諸眾生」此下是第二，即合上第二長者見火譬，明如來見眾生為五濁所惛也。	「見諸眾生」此下是第二，即合上第二長者見火譬，明如來見眾生為五濁所惛也。	005	Seeing all sentient beings and below is the second part, which combines the second part of the above Elder Sees Fire parable, to illustrate that the Tathagata sees sentient beings being confused by the five turbidities.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c20_4']	譬中本有三段：	譬中本有三段：	005	In the parable, there were originally three parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c21_4']	第一是能見，第二是所見，第三起悲愍之心。	第一是能見，第二是所見，第三起悲愍之心。	005	The first is the seer, the second is the seen, and the third is the arising of a compassionate mind.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c22_14']	今合此三段，「見諸眾生」此一句，即合上第一能見，上言「長者見」。	今合此三段，「見諸眾生」此一句，即合上第一能見，上言「長者見」。	005	Now combining these three parts, the one sentence seeing all sentient beings combines the first part of the above elder sees.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c25_11']	「為生老病死」此下即合第二所見，上言「是大火從四面起」，但〈方便品〉法說中備明五濁，上開譬中止言「大火從四面起」，此語是總；	「為生老病死」此下即合第二所見，上言「是大火從四面起」，但〈方便品〉法說中備明五濁，上開譬中止言「大火從四面起」，此語是總；	005	For birth, old age, sickness and death and below combine the second part of the above great fire arises from the four directions, but in the Dharma explanation of the Skillful Means chapter, the five turbidities are fully explained. In the above opening parable, it only says the great fire arises from the four directions, this statement is general;
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c26_14']	今此合譬中備明八苦，然五濁八苦等皆是煩累之法。	今此合譬中備明八苦，然五濁八苦等皆是煩累之法。	005	Now, in this combined metaphor, the eight sufferings are fully explained. However, the five turbidities and the eight sufferings are all dharmas of affliction.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c28_8']	今合譬中備明八苦者，「生老病死」即是四苦，「五欲財利」即是愛別離苦。	今合譬中備明八苦者，「生老病死」即是四苦，「五欲財利」即是愛別離苦。	005	Now, in the combined metaphor, the eight sufferings are fully explained. Birth, old age, sickness, and death are the four sufferings. The five desires and wealth are the suffering of separation from what one loves.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c28_13']	何以知之？	何以知之？	005	How do we know this?
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0622c29_6']	正由五欲財貨離必生苦也。	正由五欲財貨離必生苦也。	005	It is precisely because of the five desires and wealth that separation necessarily gives rise to suffering.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a02_6']	「貪著追求」即是求不得苦，凡有二種，一者物昔屬我，今日忽失為追求，亦是求不得苦；	「貪著追求」即是求不得苦，凡有二種，一者物昔屬我，今日忽失為追求，亦是求不得苦；	005	Greed and attachment are the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks, which is of two kinds. First, if something that belonged to me suddenly disappears today, it is also the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a03_6']	二者昔來未有，今求不得，亦是求不得苦也。	二者昔來未有，今求不得，亦是求不得苦也。	005	Second, if something that has not existed since ancient times is not obtained now, it is also the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a04_5']	「後受地獄畜生餓鬼之苦」，此是怨憎會苦。	「後受地獄畜生餓鬼之苦」，此是怨憎會苦。	005	Later, one will experience the suffering of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts, which is the suffering of being with what one hates.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a05_4']	「若生天上」此下，更舉前苦明五盛陰苦也。	「若生天上」此下，更舉前苦明五盛陰苦也。	005	If one is born in the heavens, this and below further bring up the previous sufferings to explain the suffering of the five aggregates.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a08_18']	「眾生沒在其中」下，是第三即合上起悲愍之心，上言「即大驚怖」乃至「無求出意」，今此中言「雖遭大苦不以為患」，若以苦為患便求出苦，既不以苦為患，故知無求出意。	「眾生沒在其中」下，是第三即合上起悲愍之心，上言「即大驚怖」乃至「無求出意」，今此中言「雖遭大苦不以為患」，若以苦為患便求出苦，既不以苦為患，故知無求出意。	005	Sentient beings are drowning in it is the third, which corresponds to the above giving rise to a mind of compassion. Above it says greatly shocked and frightened up to no intention of seeking to leave, but here it says though encountering great suffering, they do not consider it a calamity. If they considered suffering a calamity, they would seek to leave suffering. Since they do not consider suffering a calamity, it is known that they have no intention of seeking to leave.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a10_17']	此中言「東西」者非上東西，但南北為縱，東西為橫，一切眾生皆橫理用心，喻若東西也。	此中言「東西」者非上東西，但南北為縱，東西為橫，一切眾生皆橫理用心，喻若東西也。	005	Here, east and west does not refer to the east and west above, but north and south are longitudinal, and east and west are transverse. All sentient beings use their minds transversely to principles, which is like east and west.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a11_18']	終日自勞，然失避苦之方，故言「馳走」也。	終日自勞，然失避苦之方，故言「馳走」也。	005	They exhaust themselves all day long, yet they miss the method of avoiding suffering, so it says running about.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a13_15']	「舍利弗佛見此已」，此下是第三，即合上第三長者救子不得譬，明用大乘化眾生不得也。	「舍利弗佛見此已」，此下是第三，即合上第三長者救子不得譬，明用大乘化眾生不得也。	005	Śāriputra, the Buddha, having seen this... This is the third, which corresponds to the above third part of the parable of the elder unable to save his children, demonstrating the inability to transform sentient beings using the Mahāyāna.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a14_3']	上法說中有三：	上法說中有三：	005	In the above doctrinal explanation, there are three parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a14_19']	第一擬宜，第二無機，第三息化也。	第一擬宜，第二無機，第三息化也。	005	The first is the initial consideration, the second is the lack of response, and the third is the cessation of the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a15_8']	但上開譬中有兩段：	但上開譬中有兩段：	005	But above, in the opening analogy, there are two sections:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a16_7']	第一據勸教作三重，第二據誡教作三重。	第一據勸教作三重，第二據誡教作三重。	005	The first is based on the exhortative teaching and makes three layers, the second is based on the admonitory teaching and makes three layers.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a19_3']	今此中合譬還作三段，但方法不同，第一併疊合誡勸兩家擬宜，第二疊合誡勸兩家無機，第三併合誡勸兩家息化也。	今此中合譬還作三段，但方法不同，第一併疊合誡勸兩家擬宜，第二疊合誡勸兩家無機，第三併合誡勸兩家息化也。	005	Now, in this combined analogy, it is still made into three sections, but the methods are different. The first is the combined and repeated combination of the admonitory and exhortative teachings' initial considerations, the second is the repeated combination of the admonitory and exhortative teachings' lack of response, and the third is the combined combination of the admonitory and exhortative teachings' cessation of the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a21_2']	今言「佛見此已便作是念，我為眾生之父應拔其苦難」者，牒合擬宜有二，此是第一；	今言「佛見此已便作是念，我為眾生之父應拔其苦難」者，牒合擬宜有二，此是第一；	005	Now, it says The Buddha, seeing this, then had this thought, 'I am the father of sentient beings and should pull them out of suffering and danger. This is the combined explanation of the initial consideration, which is the first;
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a23_4']	然拔苦是大悲之力，此即先合第二誡教擬宜，上言「我當為說怖畏之事」乃至「具告諸子」也。	然拔苦是大悲之力，此即先合第二誡教擬宜，上言「我當為說怖畏之事」乃至「具告諸子」也。	005	However, pulling out suffering is the power of great compassion, which is then the combined explanation of the second admonitory teaching's initial consideration. Above it says I will speak to them of fearful things up to fully informing the children.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a24_11']	第二「與無量無邊佛智慧樂令其遊戲」，此是追合勸教擬宜。	第二「與無量無邊佛智慧樂令其遊戲」，此是追合勸教擬宜。	005	The second, to give them the joy of the immeasurable and boundless wisdom of the Buddhas to play in, is the pursuit of the suitability of the exhortation.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a25_9']	上言「身手有力」此明不見勸教，今不合也。	上言「身手有力」此明不見勸教，今不合也。	005	Above it says with strong arms and legs, this clarifies the non-seeing of the exhortation, now it is not suitable.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623a26_15']	「當以衣裓若以机案從舍出之」，此明正擬宜，今正合也。	「當以衣裓若以机案從舍出之」，此明正擬宜，今正合也。	005	With a robe or a chair or a desk, carry them out of the house, this clarifies the proper suitability, now it is the proper pursuit.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b01_2']	但上言衣裓明大乘因，机案譬大乘果，今此合中正合机案也、合衣裓也，亦遠擬〈方便品〉中「我所得智慧微妙最第一」，明如來總用大乘因果擬宜眾生也。	但上言衣裓明大乘因，机案譬大乘果，今此合中正合机案也、合衣裓也，亦遠擬〈方便品〉中「我所得智慧微妙最第一」，明如來總用大乘因果擬宜眾生也。	005	But above it says robe to clarify the cause of the Great Vehicle, and chair and desk is a metaphor for the fruit of the Great Vehicle, now in this pursuit it is the proper pursuit of the chair and desk, and the pursuit of the robe, it also remotely pursues the the wisdom I have attained is subtle and the foremost in the chapter on skillful means, clarifying the Tathāgata's general use of the cause and effect of the Great Vehicle to pursue sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b02_15']	「舍利弗如來復作是念」此下是第二，即合上誡勸兩家無機，亦有二：	「舍利弗如來復作是念」此下是第二，即合上誡勸兩家無機，亦有二：	005	Śāriputra, the Tathāgata further had this thought from here below is the second, which immediately pursues the two groups of no capacity for admonition and exhortation above, and there are also two:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b04_7']	第一合言「若我但以神力」先合誡家無機，上言「父雖憐愍善言誘喻」也。	第一合言「若我但以神力」先合誡家無機，上言「父雖憐愍善言誘喻」也。	005	The first part, If I only use my spiritual power, first combines the lack of affinity in the admonishing family, which is the same as the above statement Although the father had pity and used kind words to persuade.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b08_4']	第二「及智慧力捨於方便」以下追合勸家無機，就中自有二，此句正合無機，第二「所以者何」下釋無機之意，上言「復更思惟是舍唯有一門而復狹小，諸子幼稚未有所識」也。	第二「及智慧力捨於方便」以下追合勸家無機，就中自有二，此句正合無機，第二「所以者何」下釋無機之意，上言「復更思惟是舍唯有一門而復狹小，諸子幼稚未有所識」也。	005	The second part, from and the power of wisdom, abandoning skillful means, and below, continues to combine the lack of affinity in the encouraging family. Within this, there are two parts. This sentence directly combines the lack of affinity, and the second part, from Why is it so? and below, explains the meaning of the lack of affinity, which is the same as the above statement I further thought: This house has only one gate, and it is narrow. The children are young and have not yet learned anything.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b08_13']	又見一家解有二重：	又見一家解有二重：	005	Moreover, I see that one family's interpretation has two layers:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b10_6']	第一「若我但以神力」以下竟「眾生不能以是得度」，正併合誡勸兩家無機；	第一「若我但以神力」以下竟「眾生不能以是得度」，正併合誡勸兩家無機；	005	The first part, from If I only use my spiritual power and below, up to sentient beings cannot be liberated by this, directly combines the lack of affinity in both the admonishing and encouraging families;
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b11_5']	第二「所以者何」下併釋兩家無機之意也。	第二「所以者何」下併釋兩家無機之意也。	005	The second part, from Why is it so? and below, combines the explanation of the meaning of the lack of affinity in both families.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b14_12']	「何由能解佛之智慧」，但此一句即是第三併合誡勸中兩家息化，上勸息化言「戀著戲處或當墮落為火所燒」，上誡息化言但「東西走戲視父而已」。	「何由能解佛之智慧」，但此一句即是第三併合誡勸中兩家息化，上勸息化言「戀著戲處或當墮落為火所燒」，上誡息化言但「東西走戲視父而已」。	005	How can one understand the Buddha's wisdom? But this single sentence is the third combined cessation of the two teachings in the admonition and encouragement, above the encouragement to cease the teaching says clinging to the place of play may fall and be burned by fire, above the admonition to cease the teaching only says running and playing east and west, only looking at the father.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b17_6']	「舍利弗如彼長者雖復身手有力而不用之」，此下是第四段，即合上第四長者以三車救子得譬，明用三乘化得眾生也。	「舍利弗如彼長者雖復身手有力而不用之」，此下是第四段，即合上第四長者以三車救子得譬，明用三乘化得眾生也。	005	Śāriputra, although the elder had strong arms and legs, he did not use them. This is the fourth section, which combines the above fourth elder's use of the three carts to save the children and obtain the analogy, clarifying the use of the three vehicles to transform and obtain sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b17_18']	今就此合譬中大分為三段：	今就此合譬中大分為三段：	005	Now, in this combined analogy, it is divided into three sections:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b19_8']	第一先牒三種外譬來，第二帖合第三譬，第三正合第四譬也。	第一先牒三種外譬來，第二帖合第三譬，第三正合第四譬也。	005	The first is first citing the three kinds of external analogies, the second is the combined third analogy, and the third is the correct combination of the fourth analogy.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b21_1']	今者第一牒三種譬者，初言「身手有力而不用之」，此即牒上第三外譬；	今者第一牒三種譬者，初言「身手有力而不用之」，此即牒上第三外譬；	005	Now, the first is citing the three analogies. The first says having strong arms and legs, but not using them, this immediately cites the above third external analogy;
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b21_20']	次「但以慇懃方便」下，正牒上第四外譬；	次「但以慇懃方便」下，正牒上第四外譬；	005	Next, from But with earnest skillful means, it directly cites the fourth external simile above;
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b22_20']	次「然後各與珍寶大車」此下，牒上第八外譬。	次「然後各與珍寶大車」此下，牒上第八外譬。	005	Next, from Then each gives them precious great vehicles, this below cites the eighth external simile above.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b24_12']	言「如來亦復如是，雖有力無所畏而不用之」，此即第二，帖合上第三外譬也。	言「如來亦復如是，雖有力無所畏而不用之」，此即第二，帖合上第三外譬也。	005	The Tathāgata is also like this. Although he has power and fearlessness, he does not use them. This is the second, which corresponds to the third external simile above.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b25_10']	「但以智慧方便」下，第三正合第四譬也。	「但以智慧方便」下，第三正合第四譬也。	005	But with wisdom and skillful means, this is the third, which directly corresponds to the fourth simile.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623b28_8']	今四重料簡將欲合第四，所以牒第三譬來者，為欲示聖人出世之意，意在大乘，所以復牒第四譬來者，為示如來施權道意。	今四重料簡將欲合第四，所以牒第三譬來者，為欲示聖人出世之意，意在大乘，所以復牒第四譬來者，為示如來施權道意。	005	Now, the fourfold analysis is about to combine with the fourth. The reason for citing the third simile is to show the intention of the sage's appearance in the world. The intention is in the Great Vehicle. The reason for citing the fourth simile again is to show the intention of the Tathāgata's provisional teachings.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c01_4']	但眾生無有堪受大乘之機，然事不獲已用三乘化，是故牒第四譬意在於此。	但眾生無有堪受大乘之機，然事不獲已用三乘化，是故牒第四譬意在於此。	005	However, sentient beings do not have the capacity to receive the teachings of the Great Vehicle. Nevertheless, due to unavoidable circumstances, he uses the teachings of the Three Vehicles to transform them. Therefore, the intention of citing the fourth simile lies in this.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c03_11']	所以復牒第八外譬來者，為示善始令終之意，雖復中間施小，意存於大，是故牒第八來顯與大之意。	所以復牒第八外譬來者，為示善始令終之意，雖復中間施小，意存於大，是故牒第八來顯與大之意。	005	The reason for repeating the eighth external parable is to show the meaning of starting well and ending well. Although the Buddha temporarily taught the lesser vehicle in the middle, his intention was on the great vehicle. Therefore, the eighth parable is repeated to show the meaning of the great vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c05_2']	所以帖合第三者，上已合竟，既被牒持，是故帖合第三令屬上也。	所以帖合第三者，上已合竟，既被牒持，是故帖合第三令屬上也。	005	The reason for applying the third is that it has already been applied above. Since it has been repeated, it is applied to the third to connect it to the above.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c06_3']	所以不帖合第八者，下文自合，何須帖合也。	所以不帖合第八者，下文自合，何須帖合也。	005	The reason for not applying the eighth is that it will be applied below in the text itself. Why apply it now?
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c07_7']	今第三段正合第四救子得譬，但上譬中本有四種：	今第三段正合第四救子得譬，但上譬中本有四種：	005	The third section now correctly applies to the fourth parable of saving the children. But in the original parable, there were four kinds:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c09_1']	一者用三車擬宜，二者見子有宿好之心，三者為說三車，四者諸子受行。	一者用三車擬宜，二者見子有宿好之心，三者為說三車，四者諸子受行。	005	First, using the three vehicles to suggest; second, seeing that the children have a good heart; third, explaining the three vehicles; fourth, the children accepting and practicing.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c10_14']	此中亦具合四段，今言「但以智慧方便」一句，此即合第一長者用三車擬宜。	此中亦具合四段，今言「但以智慧方便」一句，此即合第一長者用三車擬宜。	005	Here, there are also four sections to apply. Now, the phrase but with wisdom and skillful means applies to the first, the elder using the three vehicles to suggest.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c12_18']	上言「是時長者即作是念，此舍已為大火所燒，我及諸子若不時出必為火所焚，我今當設方便也」。	上言「是時長者即作是念，此舍已為大火所燒，我及諸子若不時出必為火所焚，我今當設方便也」。	005	Above it says, At that time the elder had this thought: This house has already been greatly burned by fire. If I and the children do not come out in time, we will surely be burned by the fire. I should now devise a means.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c14_7']	「於三界火宅拔濟眾生」，此一句是第二，合上第二見子有宿好之心。	「於三界火宅拔濟眾生」，此一句是第二，合上第二見子有宿好之心。	005	In the burning house of the three realms, rescuing sentient beings - this one sentence is the second, corresponding to the second part above, seeing that the children have a mind to enjoy the good things of the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c15_11']	上言「父知諸子先心各有所好奇異之物情必樂著」。	上言「父知諸子先心各有所好奇異之物情必樂著」。	005	Above it says, The father knew that the children each had a mind to enjoy various rare and wonderful things.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c16_12']	「為說三乘」，此下是第三，即合上第三為說三車。	「為說三乘」，此下是第三，即合上第三為說三車。	005	Expounding the three vehicles - from here on is the third, corresponding to the third part above, expounding the three carts.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c17_3']	但上說三車中有四階：	但上說三車中有四階：	005	But above, in the explanation of the three carts, there are four steps:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c18_11']	一者讚歎三車，二者示三車處，三者勸取三車，四者保與不虛。	一者讚歎三車，二者示三車處，三者勸取三車，四者保與不虛。	005	First, praising the three carts; second, pointing out the location of the three carts; third, encouraging the taking of the three carts; fourth, assuring the gift is not false.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0623c21_10']	今者亦具足此合四階，但不次第，先合第二示三車處，第二仍超合第四保與不虛，還合第三勸取三車，第四追合第一讚歎三車也。	今者亦具足此合四階，但不次第，先合第二示三車處，第二仍超合第四保與不虛，還合第三勸取三車，第四追合第一讚歎三車也。	005	Now, it also fully possesses these four stages, but they are not in sequence. First, it combines the second stage of showing the location of the three vehicles. The second stage still skips to combine the fourth stage of guaranteeing and not being empty, and then combines the third stage of encouraging the acceptance of the three vehicles. The fourth stage pursues the combination of the first stage of praising the three vehicles.

Since the assembly at that time has attained the meaning of the non-deludedness of faith, the intention is self-evident. Therefore, the tenth non-falseness analogy is omitted.

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a04_12']	「於後舍宅欻然火起」此下兩行，是第三正明欲界火起，即是正頌欻然火起句也。	「於後舍宅欻然火起」此下兩行，是第三正明欲界火起，即是正頌欻然火起句也。	005	Later, the house suddenly caught fire - the two lines below this are the third point, which clearly states the fire breaking out in the desire realm, which is the direct praise of the line the fire suddenly broke out.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a06_4']	「諸鬼神等揚聲大叫」此下一行半偈，是第四總結欲界眾生被燒之相也。	「諸鬼神等揚聲大叫」此下一行半偈，是第四總結欲界眾生被燒之相也。	005	The ghosts and spirits raised their voices and cried out loudly - the one and a half lines of verse below this is the fourth point, which concludes the appearance of the burning of sentient beings in the desire realm.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a07_5']	「惡獸毒蟲」此下三行半偈，是第二明色界火起。	「惡獸毒蟲」此下三行半偈，是第二明色界火起。	005	Evil beasts and poisonous insects - the three and a half lines of verse below this are the second point, which clarifies the fire breaking out in the form realm.

The first line first clarifies that sentient beings in the desire realm are afflicted by the eight sufferings of afflictions, and thus they still subdue the bonds of the desire realm and are born in the form realm, which is hiding in holes and crevices.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a10_8']	第二言「薄福德故」一句，明火起所由也。	第二言「薄福德故」一句，明火起所由也。	005	The second line, due to their meager blessings and virtues, clarifies the reason for the fire's arising.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a11_6']	第三言「為火所燒」一句，正明色界火起也。	第三言「為火所燒」一句，正明色界火起也。	005	The third line, being burned by the fire, directly clarifies the arising of the fire in the form realm.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a12_5']	第四餘有兩行，明色界眾生被燒之相也。	第四餘有兩行，明色界眾生被燒之相也。	005	The remaining two lines in the fourth clarify the appearance of being burned by the fire for sentient beings in the form realm.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a14_12']	「蜈蚣蚰蜒」此下兩行偈，第三明無色界火起，亦有四階者，初一行先明色界眾生伏色界結，生無色界也。	「蜈蚣蚰蜒」此下兩行偈，第三明無色界火起，亦有四階者，初一行先明色界眾生伏色界結，生無色界也。	005	The two lines beginning with centipedes and millipedes in the third clarify the arising of the fire in the formless realm, which also has four stages. The first line first clarifies that sentient beings in the form realm subdue the bonds of the form realm and are born in the formless realm.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a16_14']	第二言「鳩槃荼鬼隨取而食」，此半行明火起所由，由彼處邪見人教化而取，故言隨取而食也。	第二言「鳩槃荼鬼隨取而食」，此半行明火起所由，由彼處邪見人教化而取，故言隨取而食也。	005	The second half line, the kumbhāṇḍa demons seize and devour them, clarifies the reason for the fire's arising. It is because those in that realm are taught by people with wrong views, and thus it says seize and devour them.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a17_20']	第三言「又諸餓鬼頭上火燃」，此半行正明無色界火起也。	第三言「又諸餓鬼頭上火燃」，此半行正明無色界火起也。	005	The third line, And the hungry ghosts have fire burning on their heads, directly illustrates the arising of fire in the formless realm.

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a22_5']	「是時宅主在門外立」此下兩行偈，頌上第二長者見火譬，譬中本有三段：	「是時宅主在門外立」此下兩行偈，頌上第二長者見火譬，譬中本有三段：	005	At that time, the householder stood outside the gate - the two lines below this verse praise the second analogy of the elder seeing the fire, which originally had three sections in the analogy:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a23_3']	一者能見，二者所見，三者起悲哀之心。	一者能見，二者所見，三者起悲哀之心。	005	First, the one who sees, second, what is seen, and third, the arising of a compassionate mind.

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a26_3']	上直言長者見火然，不出見處，今此中長出見處，以長補所闕終成三段也。	上直言長者見火然，不出見處，今此中長出見處，以長補所闕終成三段也。	005	Above it simply says the elder sees the fire burning, without specifying the place of seeing. Here, the place of seeing is specifically mentioned, and by adding the long to make up for the omission, it finally forms three sections.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a27_18']	三段者，第一半行先出見火之處，第二一句頌能見，第三一行一句頌所見也。	三段者，第一半行先出見火之處，第二一句頌能見，第三一行一句頌所見也。	005	The three sections are: the first half line first presents the place where the fire is seen, the second line praises the ability to see, and the third line and one line praise what is seen.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627a29_2']	今者第一言「是時宅主在門外立」，先出見火之處。	今者第一言「是時宅主在門外立」，先出見火之處。	005	Now, the first, At that time, the owner of the house was standing outside the gate, first presents the place where the fire is seen.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b01_17']	然立是欲行之相，如來在法身地將欲應來三界接化眾生，猶如長者欲入門也。	然立是欲行之相，如來在法身地將欲應來三界接化眾生，猶如長者欲入門也。	005	However, standing is the appearance of wanting to go. The Tathāgata is in the stage of the Dharma body, about to respond to the three realms and connect with sentient beings to be transformed, just like the elder wanting to enter the gate.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b03_18']	「聞有人言」，此一句是第二即頌上能見，上言「長者見」，今此中言聞，此則以聞代見。	「聞有人言」，此一句是第二即頌上能見，上言「長者見」，今此中言聞，此則以聞代見。	005	Hearing someone say, this one line is the second, which praises the ability to see above. Above it says the elder sees, but here it says hears. This then replaces seeing with hearing.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b06_4']	上譬道見，此明如來有照機之智，此中道聞即談感聖人之機，然感佛出世之機來關聖智，如聞有人言也。	上譬道見，此明如來有照機之智，此中道聞即談感聖人之機，然感佛出世之機來關聖智，如聞有人言也。	005	Above the parable clarifies the seeing of the Way, but here it clarifies the Tathāgata's wisdom of illuminating the capacities of beings. Here, hearing the Way immediately discusses the capacities of beings who respond to the sages. However, the capacities of beings who respond to the Buddha's appearance in the world come to involve the sage's wisdom, like hearing someone say.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b08_9']	「汝諸子等」此下一句是第三，即頌上第二所見，上言「是大火從四面起」，向言聞有人言，聞何所道？	「汝諸子等」此下一句是第三，即頌上第二所見，上言「是大火從四面起」，向言聞有人言，聞何所道？	005	Your children - this one sentence is the third, which is a verse on the second thing seen above. Above it said a great fire arises from the four sides. It was said that they heard someone say, what did they hear?

They have already received the great vehicle teaching from the time of the two myriads of koṭis of buddhas, which is the meaning of father and son, therefore it is said your children.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b13_12']	「先因遊戲來入此宅」者，故如《遺教》所明，其未度者皆亦已作得度因緣。	「先因遊戲來入此宅」者，故如《遺教》所明，其未度者皆亦已作得度因緣。	005	Having come into this house due to playing before - therefore it is like what is explained in the Sutra of the Buddha's Last Teachings, those who have not yet been liberated have all already created the causes and conditions for being liberated.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b15_11']	昔有大乘解之時，于時位心皆作出生死意，後起煩惱失大乘解，即便成入生死義。	昔有大乘解之時，于時位心皆作出生死意，後起煩惱失大乘解，即便成入生死義。	005	In the past, when they had the understanding of the great vehicle, at that time their mental states all created the intention to escape from birth and death. Later, they gave rise to afflictions and lost the understanding of the great vehicle, and then they immediately accomplished the meaning of entering birth and death.

It is precisely because of weak understanding that ignorance arises and afflictions are produced, so it is called ignorance.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b18_17']	「長者聞已」此下有六行偈，頌第三救子不得譬。	「長者聞已」此下有六行偈，頌第三救子不得譬。	005	The elder heard this - below this there are six lines of verse, praising the third simile of not being able to save the child.

The first, from the elder heard this and below, has five lines praising the tentative suitability of the two parties. Next, there are two lines praising the lack of affinity of the two parties. Next, there are two lines praising the cessation of the teaching of the two parties.

The first verse first praises the provisional teachings for the householders, which is from having strength in one's body and hands.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b27_17']	二「告喻諸子」下有四行偈，即頌誡家擬宜，即是「我當為說怖畏之事」下是也。	二「告喻諸子」下有四行偈，即頌誡家擬宜，即是「我當為說怖畏之事」下是也。	005	Admonishing the children below has four lines of verse, which praises the provisional teachings for the householders, which is from I will speak to them of fearful matters.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627b28_16']	「諸子無知」下二句是第二，即併頌兩家無機。	「諸子無知」下二句是第二，即併頌兩家無機。	005	The children are ignorant below has two lines, which is the second part, which praises the two households having no affinity.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c04_11']	有二者，初言「諸子無知」一句即勸家無機，上無機中本有二，今不頌第一大乘教於其無用，即是「是舍唯有一門而復狹小」，唯頌有小無大，今此「諸子無知」一句總頌上有小無大，即是「諸子幼稚未有所識」也。	有二者，初言「諸子無知」一句即勸家無機，上無機中本有二，今不頌第一大乘教於其無用，即是「是舍唯有一門而復狹小」，唯頌有小無大，今此「諸子無知」一句總頌上有小無大，即是「諸子幼稚未有所識」也。	005	There are two. The first says the children are ignorant, which is the provisional teachings for the householders having no affinity. The above having no affinity originally had two parts, but now the first part about the Mahayana teachings being useless is not praised, which is this house has only one gate and it is also narrow. It only praises having the small and not having the great. Now the children are ignorant praises in general the above having the small and not having the great, which is the children are young and have not yet learned anything.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c05_19']	二「雖聞父誨」一句即頌誡家無機，即是「父雖憐愍善言誘喻」也。	二「雖聞父誨」一句即頌誡家無機，即是「父雖憐愍善言誘喻」也。	005	The two lines Although they heard their father's instructions are a verse on the family's lack of affinity with the teachings, which is the same as Although the father pitied them and used kind words to persuade them.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c07_13']	第三兩句頌兩家息化，自有二者，初句即頌勸家息化，即是「戀著戲處」也。	第三兩句頌兩家息化，自有二者，初句即頌勸家息化，即是「戀著戲處」也。	005	The third two lines are a verse on the two families ceasing their spiritual guidance. There are two parts: the first line is a verse on ceasing to guide the family, which is the same as clinging to the place of play.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c08_20']	二「嬉戲不已」一句即頌誡家息化，上言「東西走戲視父而已」也。	二「嬉戲不已」一句即頌誡家息化，上言「東西走戲視父而已」也。	005	The line playing and not stopping is a verse on the admonition to cease guiding the family, which above said running and playing to the east and west, only looking at their father.

The first five lines verse the intended suitability, and the last line verses the lack of affinity, not the cessation of spiritual guidance.

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c17_9']	但上譬中本有四段，第一以三車擬宜，二者見子有宿好之心，三者為說三車，四者諸子受行。	但上譬中本有四段，第一以三車擬宜，二者見子有宿好之心，三者為說三車，四者諸子受行。	005	But in the original parable there were originally four sections: the first is using the three carts to suggest, the second is seeing that the children have a good heart, the third is explaining the three carts, and the fourth is the children accepting and practicing.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c19_9']	今此中略不頌第二見子宿好，上言「父知諸子先心各有所好奇異之物情必樂著」也。	今此中略不頌第二見子宿好，上言「父知諸子先心各有所好奇異之物情必樂著」也。	005	Now this briefly does not praise the second seeing the children's past goodness. The above says: The father knows that the minds of the children are each attached to various rare and strange things, and they will certainly delight in them.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c20_4']	今七行半中分為三段，頌上三段。	今七行半中分為三段，頌上三段。	005	Now in the seven and a half lines, it is divided into three sections, praising the above three sections.

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c26_11']	「告諸子等」此下三行即是超頌第三為說三車，上說三車中本有四階，今三行具足頌之：	「告諸子等」此下三行即是超頌第三為說三車，上說三車中本有四階，今三行具足頌之：	005	The three lines below Announcing to the children are the third verse that transcends and praises the three vehicles. There were originally four steps in the explanation of the three vehicles, and now the three lines fully praise them:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0627c27_18']	一行頌第一，三句頌第二，又三句頌第三，半行頌第四也。	一行頌第一，三句頌第二，又三句頌第三，半行頌第四也。	005	One line praises the first, three lines praise the second, and three lines praise the third, while half a line praises the fourth.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0628a01_6']	今「告諸子等」一行即頌第一讚歎三車，上言「而告之言汝等所可玩好希有難得，汝若不取後必憂悔」也。	今「告諸子等」一行即頌第一讚歎三車，上言「而告之言汝等所可玩好希有難得，汝若不取後必憂悔」也。	005	Now, the one line Announcing to the children praises the first, praising the three vehicles. The above says and he told them, 'What you enjoy and delight in is rare and difficult to obtain. If you do not take it, you will surely regret it later.'
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0628a03_5']	次「羊車鹿車」此下三句即頌第二階示三車處，上言「如此種種羊鹿牛車今在門外」也。	次「羊車鹿車」此下三句即頌第二階示三車處，上言「如此種種羊鹿牛車今在門外」也。	005	Next, the sheep cart and deer cart - these three sentences correspond to the second section of the verse that shows the location of the three carts, which states above, These various sheep, deer, and ox carts are now outside the gate.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0628a05_1']	「汝等出來」又有三句，即頌上第三勸取三車，上言「汝等於此火宅宜速出來」也。	「汝等出來」又有三句，即頌上第三勸取三車，上言「汝等於此火宅宜速出來」也。	005	You should come out - there are three more sentences, which correspond to the third section above that encourages taking the three carts, which states above, You should quickly come out of this burning house.

I explained the causes of the Great Vehicle as such and such, and the fruits of the Great Vehicle as this and that. At that time, I did not seek the causes of the Great Vehicle, nor did I seek the fruits of the Great Vehicle. At that time, I knew for myself that the causes and effects of the Great Vehicle were good dharmas, but I simply did not seek them. Why is this so?

This is the meaning of attaining for oneself.

It has two [parts]. The first lists the three kinds of chapters on not seeking. The second, from being incapable of anything, below, explains the above three chapters.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0632c03_1']	三章門者，一言「居僧之首」故不求，二者言「年朽邁」故不求，三者言「自謂已得涅槃」故不求；	三章門者，一言「居僧之首」故不求，二者言「年朽邁」故不求，三者言「自謂已得涅槃」故不求；	005	As for the three reasons, the first is saying being at the head of the resident monks so they did not seek, the second is saying their years were already advanced so they did not seek, and the third is saying they considered themselves to have already attained nirvana so they did not seek;

At that time, I had disciples who all followed me in studying the teachings of the Lesser Vehicle. If I suddenly changed my mind and reformed, it would not be appropriate for the leader of the assembly to do so. For this reason, I did not give rise to the seeking mind towards the causes and effects of the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0632c11_3']	第二上云年朽邁故不求者，菩薩之懷不惜身命無方益物，我等年時已謝，何能為之？	第二上云年朽邁故不求者，菩薩之懷不惜身命無方益物，我等年時已謝，何能為之？	005	The second verse says because of old age means that the bodhisattva's mind does not spare life and limb, benefiting beings in all ways, but we have already passed the age, how can we do it?
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0632c12_11']	前言居僧首者明法臘已大，後復言年已朽邁者明俗年復高；	前言居僧首者明法臘已大，後復言年已朽邁者明俗年復高；	005	The previous verse says dwelling at the head of the monks clarifies that the Dharma age is already great, later it again says old age clarifies that the secular age is also high;

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0632c16_6']	又聞佛言：	又聞佛言：	005	Moreover, I heard the Buddha say:

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0632c21_9']	「世尊往昔說法既久」此下釋上第一居僧之首故不求也。	「世尊往昔說法既久」此下釋上第一居僧之首故不求也。	005	The World-Honored One spoke the Dharma a long time ago - below this explains the first point of not seeking because of being the head of the Sangha.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0632c22_14']	「說法既久」者，不言佛坐已久，只立指波若坐席故言久。	「說法既久」者，不言佛坐已久，只立指波若坐席故言久。	005	Spoke the Dharma a long time ago does not mean the Buddha sat for a long time, it only refers to the long time of the Prajnaparamita teachings, thus saying a long time.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0632c23_12']	於大乘因果中不作心，故言「疲懈」。	於大乘因果中不作心，故言「疲懈」。	005	Not making the mind in the cause and effect of the Mahayana, thus saying tired and slack.

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a06_14']	「譬若有人」自此下訖長行，是第三廣領解，就此廣領解之中亦有二：	「譬若有人」自此下訖長行，是第三廣領解，就此廣領解之中亦有二：	005	It is like a person - from here to the end of the prose, this is the third part, which broadly understands. In this broad understanding, there are also two parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a07_6']	第一開譬，第二合譬。	第一開譬，第二合譬。	005	The first is the parable, and the second is the combination of the parable.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a09_2']	就開譬之中凡作九譬，領上火宅十譬，亦遠領〈方便品〉中十譬之本，不盡領十譬。	就開譬之中凡作九譬，領上火宅十譬，亦遠領〈方便品〉中十譬之本，不盡領十譬。	005	In the explanation of the parable, there are nine parables in total, which correspond to the ten parables in the Burning House, and also correspond to the ten parables in the Skillful Means chapter, but not all ten parables are completely corresponded to.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a11_11']	上火宅中本有十譬，此中唯領七譬不領三譬，不領第六父歡喜，亦不領第七諸子索車，亦不領第十不虛也。	上火宅中本有十譬，此中唯領七譬不領三譬，不領第六父歡喜，亦不領第七諸子索車，亦不領第十不虛也。	005	In the original Burning House, there were ten parables, but here only seven parables are corresponded to, and three parables are not corresponded to. The sixth, the father's joy, is not corresponded to, the seventh, the children's request for vehicles, is also not corresponded to, and the tenth, the non-falseness, is also not corresponded to.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a12_17']	所以不領第六者，只解第五免難譬，第六父歡喜之義自彰。	所以不領第六者，只解第五免難譬，第六父歡喜之義自彰。	005	The reason for not corresponding to the sixth is that only the fifth parable of escaping from the disaster is explained, and the meaning of the sixth, the father's joy, is revealed by itself.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a14_8']	所以不領第七者，上諸子索車，此即是迷惑之心，是故隱而不領。	所以不領第七者，上諸子索車，此即是迷惑之心，是故隱而不領。	005	The reason for not corresponding to the seventh is that in the original request for vehicles by the children, this is precisely the deluded mind, therefore it is concealed and not corresponded to.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a15_19']	所以不領第十者，上第十是不虛妄，今日既得解，何假領上不虛妄？	所以不領第十者，上第十是不虛妄，今日既得解，何假領上不虛妄？	005	The reason for not corresponding to the tenth is that the tenth in the original is about non-falseness. Since today's understanding has already been attained, why is it necessary to correspond to the non-falseness in the original?
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a17_11']	若使領者如似言不解之時，昔日有虛妄，今日既無虛妄，是故不領也。	若使領者如似言不解之時，昔日有虛妄，今日既無虛妄，是故不領也。	005	If the one who receives it were like one who does not understand the words, then there would have been delusion in the past, but since there is no delusion today, therefore it is not received.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a21_14']	上既有十譬，今唯領七譬只應有七，所以有九譬者，此中第四第五兩譬共領上火宅中第四長者救子得譬，此中第六付財物譬，不領上開三顯一之意，此乃遠領《大品》座席時意。	上既有十譬，今唯領七譬只應有七，所以有九譬者，此中第四第五兩譬共領上火宅中第四長者救子得譬，此中第六付財物譬，不領上開三顯一之意，此乃遠領《大品》座席時意。	005	Above there were ten parables, but now there are only seven parables. There should only be seven, but there are nine parables. The reason for this is that the fourth and fifth parables here together receive the fourth parable of the elder saving his sons in the burning house above. The sixth parable of entrusting property here does not receive the meaning of revealing the one vehicle after revealing three above. This is far from receiving the meaning of the time of the Great Vehicle in the Great Collection Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a24_13']	但窮子今日深取佛意，則言昔日《大品》時佛已令我為菩薩轉教說般若，但佛于時眾中，令我說此大乘因果，則始終會令汝得此因果。	但窮子今日深取佛意，則言昔日《大品》時佛已令我為菩薩轉教說般若，但佛于時眾中，令我說此大乘因果，則始終會令汝得此因果。	005	But the poor son today deeply grasps the Buddha's meaning, and says that in the past at the time of the Great Vehicle, the Buddha had already made me turn the wheel of the bodhisattva and teach prajñā. But at that time in the assembly, the Buddha had me teach this cause and effect of the Great Vehicle, and from beginning to end he gathered them to make you attain this cause and effect.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633a25_12']	須菩提今日既得解，是故深取此意也。	須菩提今日既得解，是故深取此意也。	005	Subhūti today has already attained understanding, and therefore deeply grasps this meaning.

['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633b05_1']	今者第一譬，「若有人」下訖「無復憂慮」，詺為父子相失譬，此則領上火宅中第一宅主譬，亦名總譬，亦遠領〈方便品〉中「今我亦如是」下明釋迦同諸佛先三後一化五濁眾生之主。	今者第一譬，「若有人」下訖「無復憂慮」，詺為父子相失譬，此則領上火宅中第一宅主譬，亦名總譬，亦遠領〈方便品〉中「今我亦如是」下明釋迦同諸佛先三後一化五濁眾生之主。	005	Now, the first parable, from If there is a person to no more worries, is called the parable of father and son losing each other. This corresponds to the first parable of the house owner in the Burning House chapter, and is also called the general parable. It also remotely corresponds to the passage below Now I am also like this in the chapter on skillful means, which clarifies that Shakyamuni is the same as the buddhas in first using the three vehicles and later the one vehicle to transform beings in the five turbidities.
['ZH_T33_1715_005:0633b09_1']	第二從「傭賃展轉」下訖「我雖年朽猶故貪惜」，是名父子相見譬，此則領上火宅中第三長者見火譬，亦遠領〈方便品〉中第二「舍利弗當知我以佛眼觀」下，明佛見眾生為五濁所惛也。	第二從「傭賃展轉」下訖「我雖年朽猶故貪惜」，是名父子相見譬，此則領上火宅中第三長者見火譬，亦遠領〈方便品〉中第二「舍利弗當知我以佛眼觀」下，明佛見眾生為五濁所惛也。	005	The second part, from hired by the day to although I am old, I still greedily cling to it, is called the father and son seeing each other metaphor. This corresponds to the third part of the Fire-house chapter, the elder seeing the fire metaphor, and also remotely corresponds to the second part of the Skillful Means chapter, from Śāriputra, you should know... to with my Buddha-eye I observe... which clarifies the Buddha seeing sentient beings confused by the five turbidities.
