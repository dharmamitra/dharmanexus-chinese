['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b11_13']	又契經說，一切有情皆依食住。	又契經說，一切有情皆依食住。	Moreover, a scripture says, All sentient beings depend on food to live.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b12_7']	若無此識，彼識食體不應有故。	若無此識，彼識食體不應有故。	If this consciousness did not exist, the substance of that food would not exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b12_16']	謂契經說食有四種：	謂契經說食有四種：	It is said in a scripture that food is of four kinds:
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b13_8']	一者段食，變壞為相。	一者段食，變壞為相。	First, coarse food, characterized by transformation and destruction.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b15_6']	謂欲界繫香味觸三，於變壞時能為食事，由此色處非段食攝，以變壞時色無用故。	謂欲界繫香味觸三，於變壞時能為食事，由此色處非段食攝，以變壞時色無用故。	This refers to the three sense objects of smell, taste, and touch in the desire realm. When they transform and are destroyed, they can serve as nourishment. Therefore, the sense object of form is not included in coarse food, because when it transforms and is destroyed, form has no function.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b15_16']	二者觸食，觸境為相。	二者觸食，觸境為相。	Second, contact food, characterized by contact with objects.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b16_15']	謂有漏觸纔取境時，攝受喜等能為食事。	謂有漏觸纔取境時，攝受喜等能為食事。	This refers to contaminated contact. When it just grasps an object, it can absorb joy and serve as nourishment.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b18_15']	此觸雖與諸識相應，屬六識者食義偏勝，觸麁顯境攝，受喜樂及順益捨資養勝故。	此觸雖與諸識相應，屬六識者食義偏勝，觸麁顯境攝，受喜樂及順益捨資養勝故。	Although this contact is associated with various consciousnesses, the one belonging to the six consciousnesses is most excellent in meaning as food, because contact with gross and obvious objects, joy, pleasure, and beneficial equanimity, is most excellent in nourishing.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b19_7']	三意思食，希望為相。	三意思食，希望為相。	Third, mental intention food, characterized by aspiration.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b20_6']	謂有漏思與欲俱轉，希可愛境能為食事。	謂有漏思與欲俱轉，希可愛境能為食事。	That is, impure volition that occurs together with craving and hopes for a desirable object can serve as nutriment.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b21_15']	此思雖與諸識相應，屬意識者食義偏勝，意識於境希望勝故。	此思雖與諸識相應，屬意識者食義偏勝，意識於境希望勝故。	Although this volition is associated with various forms of consciousness, its function of nutriment is especially strong in mental consciousness, because mental consciousness is superior in its hopes and desires concerning objects.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b22_6']	四者識食，執持為相。	四者識食，執持為相。	The fourth is consciousness as nutriment, whose characteristic is that of grasping.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b24_14']	謂有漏識由段觸思勢力增長能為食事，此識雖通諸識自體，而第八識食義偏勝，一類相續執持勝故。	謂有漏識由段觸思勢力增長能為食事，此識雖通諸識自體，而第八識食義偏勝，一類相續執持勝故。	That is, impure consciousness increases in power through the force of the material, contact, and volitional nutriments and can serve as nutriment. Although this consciousness is common to all forms of consciousness, the eighth consciousness is especially strong as nutriment, because it is a single species, continues in a series, and grasps its object.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b25_13']	由是《集論》說此四食，三蘊五處十一界攝。	由是《集論》說此四食，三蘊五處十一界攝。	Consequently, the Abhidharmasamuccaya says that these four nutriments are included in three aggregates, five sense bases, and eleven elements.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b26_12']	此四能持有情身命令不壞斷，故名為食。	此四能持有情身命令不壞斷，故名為食。	These four are called nutriments because they sustain the body and life of sentient beings and prevent their destruction.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017b28_3']	段食唯於欲界有用，觸意思食雖遍三界，而依識轉隨識有無。	段食唯於欲界有用，觸意思食雖遍三界，而依識轉隨識有無。	Material food is useful only in the realm of desire. Contact, volition, and consciousness as nutriment are found throughout the three realms, but they evolve in dependence on consciousness and exist or not depending on its presence or absence.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c01_3']	眼等轉識有間有轉，非遍恒時能持身命，謂無心定、睡眠、悶絕、無想天中有間斷故。	眼等轉識有間有轉，非遍恒時能持身命，謂無心定、睡眠、悶絕、無想天中有間斷故。	The evolving consciousnesses such as visual consciousness are interrupted and change objects, and therefore they cannot always and everywhere support life and keep the body. That is, they are interrupted in the samādhi of unconsciousness, in deep sleep, in fainting, and among the unconscious celestials.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c02_12']	設有心位，隨所依緣性界地等有轉易故，於持身命非遍非恒。	設有心位，隨所依緣性界地等有轉易故，於持身命非遍非恒。	Even when they are present, they change according to the support, object, nature, realm, stage, etc., and therefore they are not always and everywhere able to support life and keep the body.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c04_4']	諸有執無第八識者，依何等食，經作是言一切有情皆依食住。	諸有執無第八識者，依何等食，經作是言一切有情皆依食住。	Those who maintain that there is no eighth consciousness must explain what kind of nutriment is referred to in the scriptures when they say that all sentient beings are sustained by nutriment.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c05_13']	非無心位過去未來識等為食，彼非現常，如空花等無體用故。	非無心位過去未來識等為食，彼非現常，如空花等無體用故。	Past and future dharmas such as consciousness are not nutriment when the mind is unconscious, because they are not present and are as nonexistent as flowers in the sky and have no power.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c06_14']	設有體用非現在攝，如虛空等非食性故。	設有體用非現在攝，如虛空等非食性故。	Even if they have power, they are not present and are like space, etc., and therefore not nutriment.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c08_16']	亦不可說入定心等與無心位有情為食，住無心時彼已滅故，過去非食已極成故。	亦不可說入定心等與無心位有情為食，住無心時彼已滅故，過去非食已極成故。	You cannot say that the mind of one who enters samādhi is nutriment for one who is unconscious, because when one is unconscious, the mind has already ceased, and because it has been demonstrated that past does not function as nutriment.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c10_15']	又不可說無想定等不相應行即為彼食，段等四食所不攝故，不相應法非實有故。	又不可說無想定等不相應行即為彼食，段等四食所不攝故，不相應法非實有故。	Nor can you say that the food of the sameness of nonidentification is the nonassociated formative forces of the sameness of nonidentification, because they are not included in the four foods of material food, etc., and because nonassociated dharmas are not real.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c11_17']	有執滅定等猶有第六識，於彼有情能為食事。	有執滅定等猶有第六識，於彼有情能為食事。	There is an opinion that in samādhi of cessation, etc., there is still a sixth consciousness that can be the food of those sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c12_9']	彼執非理，後當廣破。	彼執非理，後當廣破。	This opinion is unreasonable, as will be discussed later.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c13_8']	又彼應說生上二界無漏心時以何為食？	又彼應說生上二界無漏心時以何為食？	Also, they must explain what is the food of sentient beings born in the two upper realms when their minds are pure.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c14_8']	無漏識等破壞有故，於彼身命不可為食。	無漏識等破壞有故，於彼身命不可為食。	Because pure consciousness, etc., destroy existence, they cannot be food for the body and life of those sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c16_8']	亦不可執無漏識中有有漏種能為彼食，無漏識等猶如涅槃，不能執持有漏種故。	亦不可執無漏識中有有漏種能為彼食，無漏識等猶如涅槃，不能執持有漏種故。	You cannot claim that the pure consciousness contains impure seeds that can be food for those sentient beings, because pure consciousness, etc., are like nirvāṇa and cannot contain impure seeds.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c17_17']	復不可說上界有情身命相持即互為食，四食不攝彼身命故。	復不可說上界有情身命相持即互為食，四食不攝彼身命故。	You cannot claim that the body and life of sentient beings in the upper two realms support each other and are each others food, because the four foods do not include body and life.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c19_2']	又無色無身，命無能持故，眾同分等無實體故。	又無色無身，命無能持故，眾同分等無實體故。	Also, in the formless realm there is no body, and life has no support, and because the class of sentient beings, etc., have no real substance.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c21_10']	由此定知，異諸轉識有異熟識，一類恒遍執持身命令不壞斷，世尊依此故作是言一切有情皆依食住。	由此定知，異諸轉識有異熟識，一類恒遍執持身命令不壞斷，世尊依此故作是言一切有情皆依食住。	Therefore we know with certainty that apart from the evolving consciousnesses there is a consciousness as retribution that is a single species, is perpetual and universal, holds the body and causes it not to perish, and on the basis of which the World Honored One says that all sentient beings live by means of nutriment.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c23_11']	唯依取蘊建立有情，佛無有漏非有情攝，說為有情依食住者，當知皆依示現而說。	唯依取蘊建立有情，佛無有漏非有情攝，說為有情依食住者，當知皆依示現而說。	Sentient beings are established on the basis of the aggregates that are grasped by the passions. The Buddha, being free of outflows, is not included in the category of sentient beings. When it is said that he lives by means of nutriment, you should understand that this is said with a hidden intention.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c24_11']	既異熟識是勝食性，彼識即是此第八識。	既異熟識是勝食性，彼識即是此第八識。	Since the consciousness as retribution is the best kind of nutriment, that consciousness is the eighth consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c27_1']	又契經說，住滅定者身語心行無不皆滅，而壽不滅亦不離煖，根無變壞，識不離身。	又契經說，住滅定者身語心行無不皆滅，而壽不滅亦不離煖，根無變壞，識不離身。	A scripture says that in one who has entered the samādhi of cessation, bodily, vocal, and mental actions are all extinguished, yet he is not separated from consciousness, life, or heat. His faculties are not deteriorated, and his consciousness is not separated from his body.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c28_2']	若無此識，住滅定者不離身識不應有故。	若無此識，住滅定者不離身識不應有故。	If this eighth consciousness did not exist, one who has entered the samādhi of cessation would be separated from his consciousness, because the six consciousnesses, such as visual consciousness, do not exist in a state of samādhi, and because the seventh consciousness, i.e., manas, does not exist in this samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0017c29_2']	謂眼等識行相麁動，於所緣境起必勞慮。	謂眼等識行相麁動，於所緣境起必勞慮。	The reason is that the characteristics of the six consciousnesses, such as visual consciousness, are gross and unstable, and when they arise with respect to an object, they must be accompanied by mental activities.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a02_2']	厭患彼故暫求止息，漸次伏除至都盡位，依此位立住滅定者，故此定中彼識皆滅。	厭患彼故暫求止息，漸次伏除至都盡位，依此位立住滅定者，故此定中彼識皆滅。	Because one is disgusted with them, one temporarily seeks to stop them. Gradually subduing and eliminating them, one reaches the state of complete exhaustion. One is said to abide in the samādhi of cessation on the basis of this state, and therefore consciousness ceases in this samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a03_11']	若不許有微細一類恒遍執持壽等識在，依何而說識不離身？	若不許有微細一類恒遍執持壽等識在，依何而說識不離身？	If you do not admit that there is a subtle, single, universal consciousness that holds life, etc., on what do you base the statement that consciousness does not leave the body?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a06_8']	若謂後時彼識還起，如隔日瘧名不離身，是則不應說心行滅，識與想等起滅同故，壽煖諸根應亦如識，便成大過。	若謂後時彼識還起，如隔日瘧名不離身，是則不應說心行滅，識與想等起滅同故，壽煖諸根應亦如識，便成大過。	If you say that consciousness returns later, like a case of malaria, and that this is what it means for consciousness not to leave the body, then you should not say that the activities of mind cease, because consciousness arises and ceases together with thought, etc. Life, heat, and the organs would also be like consciousness, and this would be a serious error.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a07_4']	故應許識如壽煖等實不離身。	故應許識如壽煖等實不離身。	Therefore you must admit that consciousness, like life, heat, etc., does not really leave the body.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a08_13']	又此位中若全無識，應如瓦礫非有情數，豈得說為住滅定者？	又此位中若全無識，應如瓦礫非有情數，豈得說為住滅定者？	Moreover, if there were no consciousness at all in this state, it would be like a piece of tile or stone and not a sentient being. How can you say that it is a person abiding in the samādhi of cessation?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a09_13']	又異熟識此位若無，誰能執持諸根壽煖？	又異熟識此位若無，誰能執持諸根壽煖？	Moreover, if the consciousness that is retribution did not exist in this state, what would hold the organs, life, and heat?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a10_13']	無執持故皆應壞滅，猶如死屍便無壽等。	無執持故皆應壞滅，猶如死屍便無壽等。	If there were no holding, they would be destroyed, just like a dead corpse, and there would be no life, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a11_14']	既爾後識必不還生，說不離身，彼何所屬？	既爾後識必不還生，說不離身，彼何所屬？	Therefore the last moment of consciousness does not return to life, and when it is said that consciousness is not separated from the body, to what does this refer?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a12_13']	諸異熟識捨此身已，離識餘身無重生故。	諸異熟識捨此身已，離識餘身無重生故。	When the consciousness that is retribution leaves this body, it does not return to life without consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a13_14']	又若此位無持種識，後識無種如何得生？	又若此位無持種識，後識無種如何得生？	Also, if there is no consciousness that holds seeds in this state, how can the subsequent consciousness arise without seeds?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a14_14']	過去未來不相應法非實有體，已極成故。	過去未來不相應法非實有體，已極成故。	Because it has been proven that past, future, non-psychophysical existence, and dharmas unassociated with mind do not really exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a15_13']	諸色等法離識皆無受熏持種，亦已遮故。	諸色等法離識皆無受熏持種，亦已遮故。	It has also been refuted that form and other dharmas apart from consciousness are perfumable and hold seeds.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a17_4']	然滅定等無心位中如有心位，定實有識，具根壽煖有情攝故。	然滅定等無心位中如有心位，定實有識，具根壽煖有情攝故。	However, in the state of mindless samādhi, such as that of cessation, there is consciousness, just as there is in the state of mind, because there is a real basis of the psychophysical complex, life, heat, and sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a18_4']	由斯理趣，住滅定者決定有識實不離身。	由斯理趣，住滅定者決定有識實不離身。	For this reason, one who is in the samādhi of cessation definitely has consciousness and does not really leave the body.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a19_13']	若謂此位有第六識名不離身，亦不應理，此定亦名無心定故。	若謂此位有第六識名不離身，亦不應理，此定亦名無心定故。	If it is claimed that in this state there is a sixth consciousness that is not separated from the body, that also is not reasonable, because this samādhi is also called mindless samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a21_4']	若無五識名無心者，應一切定皆名無心，諸定皆無五識身故。	若無五識名無心者，應一切定皆名無心，諸定皆無五識身故。	If it is called mindless because the five consciousnesses are absent, then all samādhis should be called mindless, because all samādhis are devoid of the five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a22_4']	意識攝在六轉識中，如五識身滅定非有。	意識攝在六轉識中，如五識身滅定非有。	Mental consciousness is included among the six evolving consciousnesses, just as the five consciousnesses do not exist in samādhi without conceptualization.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a23_7']	或此位識行相所緣不可知故，如壽煖等非第六識。	或此位識行相所緣不可知故，如壽煖等非第六識。	Or, consciousness in this state cannot be known in terms of mode of activity and objects, like life, heat, etc., and is not the sixth consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a25_12']	若此位有行相所緣可知識者，應如餘位非此位攝，本為止息行相所緣可了知識入此定故。	若此位有行相所緣可知識者，應如餘位非此位攝，本為止息行相所緣可了知識入此定故。	If there were consciousness in this state that could be known in terms of mode of activity and objects, it would be like consciousness in other states and would not be included in this state. The reason for entering this samādhi is to stop the mode of activity and objects of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a26_13']	又若此位有第六識，彼心所法為有為無？	又若此位有第六識，彼心所法為有為無？	Also, if there is sixth consciousness in this state, do its mental activities exist or not?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a28_5']	若有心所，經不應言住此定者心行皆滅，又不應名滅受想定。	若有心所，經不應言住此定者心行皆滅，又不應名滅受想定。	If they exist, the scriptures should not say that in this samādhi, all activities of mind cease, nor should they call it the samādhi of the cessation of feeling and conceptualization.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018a29_5']	此定加行但厭受想，故此定中唯受想滅。	此定加行但厭受想，故此定中唯受想滅。	The preparatory practice for this samādhi is simply the disgust with feeling and conceptualization, and therefore only feeling and conceptualization cease in this samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b01_13']	受想二法資助心強，諸心所中獨名心行，說心行滅何所相違？	受想二法資助心強，諸心所中獨名心行，說心行滅何所相違？	Feeling and conceptualization are the most powerful of the mental activities and are therefore called activities of mind. What is there to contradict the statement that they cease?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b02_9']	無想定中應唯想滅，但厭想故。	無想定中應唯想滅，但厭想故。	In the samādhi of nonconceptualization, only conceptualization would cease, because one is only disgusted with conceptualization.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b04_13']	然汝不許，既唯受想資助心強，此二滅時心亦應滅，如身行滅而身猶在，寧要責心令同行滅？	然汝不許，既唯受想資助心強，此二滅時心亦應滅，如身行滅而身猶在，寧要責心令同行滅？	But you do not admit this, and if only feeling and conceptualization are strong in assisting the mind, then when the two are extinguished, the mind should also be extinguished. If you say that the body still exists when bodily activity is extinguished, why do you insist that the mind must be extinguished when activity is extinguished?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b05_14']	若爾語行尋伺滅時，語應不滅，而非所許。	若爾語行尋伺滅時，語應不滅，而非所許。	If this is so, then when the activity of speech, i.e., investigation and analysis, is extinguished, speech should not be extinguished, but this is not admitted.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b07_3']	然行於法有遍非遍，遍行滅時法定隨滅，非遍行滅法或猶在。	然行於法有遍非遍，遍行滅時法定隨滅，非遍行滅法或猶在。	Activity is either universal or non-universal with regard to dharmas. When universal activity is extinguished, the dharma definitely perishes along with it. When non-universal activity is extinguished, the dharma may still remain.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b08_2']	非遍行者，謂入出息，見息滅時身猶在故。	非遍行者，謂入出息，見息滅時身猶在故。	Non-universal activity refers to inhalation and exhalation, because when exhalation is extinguished, the body may still remain.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b09_2', 'ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b11_2']	尋伺於語是遍行攝，彼若滅時語定無故。🔽受想於心亦遍行攝，許如思等大地法故，受想滅時心定隨滅，如何可說彼滅心在？	尋伺於語是遍行攝，彼若滅時語定無故。 受想於心亦遍行攝，許如思等大地法故，受想滅時心定隨滅，如何可說彼滅心在？	Investigation and analysis are categorized as universal activities with regard to speech, because when they are extinguished, speech definitely does not exist.🔽Feeling and conceptualization are also categorized as universal activities with regard to the mind, because we admit that they are like volition, etc., as dharmas that are found in all minds. When feeling and conceptualization are extinguished, the mind definitely perishes along with them. How can you say that they are extinguished and the mind remains?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b12_1']	又許思等是大地法，滅受想時彼亦應滅。	又許思等是大地法，滅受想時彼亦應滅。	Also, you admit that volition, etc., are dharmas that are found in all minds. When feeling and conceptualization are extinguished, they should also be extinguished.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b13_1']	既爾信等此位亦無，非遍行滅餘可在故。	既爾信等此位亦無，非遍行滅餘可在故。	If this is so, then faith and so on would also not exist in this state, because the universal mental activities are eliminated and the rest are not present.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b13_10']	如何可言有餘心所？	如何可言有餘心所？	How can you say that other mental activities exist?
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0018b14_11']	既許思等此位非無，受想應然，大地法故。	既許思等此位非無，受想應然，大地法故。	If you admit that volition and so on are not absent in this state, then feeling and conceptualization must also be present, because they are activities that occur in all states of mind.

It would have a common object with mental consciousness. Those born in the formless realms would not grasp the seen part as a self, because they are disgusted with form and do not transform it.

Contact, attention, feeling, conceptualization, and volition are associated with manas and the universal mental activities, because it is definitely so.

This consciousness spontaneously encounters an object that has already been obtained and does not need to be sought, and therefore there is no desire.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0022b26_3']	勝解印持曾未定境，此識無始恒緣定事，經所印持故無勝解。	勝解印持曾未定境，此識無始恒緣定事，經所印持故無勝解。	Resolve is the firm apprehension of an object that has not been ascertained. This consciousness, from beginningless time, always encounters an object that is already ascertained, and therefore there is no resolve.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0022b27_12']	念唯記憶曾所習事，此識恒緣現所受境無所記憶，故無有念。	念唯記憶曾所習事，此識恒緣現所受境無所記憶，故無有念。	Recollection is the remembering of something already experienced. This consciousness always encounters present objects that are being experienced and does not remember, and therefore there is no recollection.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0022b29_4']	定唯繫心專注一境，此識任運剎那別緣，既不專一故無有定。	定唯繫心專注一境，此識任運剎那別緣，既不專一故無有定。	Samādhi is the fixing of the mind on one object. This consciousness spontaneously encounters objects in a succession of moments and does not fix the mind on one object, and therefore there is no samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0022b29_13']	慧即我見故不別說。	慧即我見故不別說。	Discrimination is the view of a self, and therefore it is not mentioned separately.

This consciousness is always accompanied by four passions, and there are no differences in their states before and after, and therefore there are no secondary passions that accompany this consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0022c05_3']	惡作追悔先所造業，此識任運恒緣現境，非悔先業故無惡作。	惡作追悔先所造業，此識任運恒緣現境，非悔先業故無惡作。	Regret is remorse for something done in the past, but this consciousness spontaneously always has the present as its object and is not remorse for something done in the past, and therefore there is no regret.
['ZH_T31_1585_004:0022c07_2']	睡眠必依身心重昧，外眾緣力有時暫起，此識無始一類內執不假外緣，故彼非有。	睡眠必依身心重昧，外眾緣力有時暫起，此識無始一類內執不假外緣，故彼非有。	Sleepiness necessarily depends on heaviness and dullness of body and mind, and sometimes it arises temporarily due to external conditions. This consciousness is unitary and evolves from beginningless time grasping an inner object and does not depend on external conditions, and therefore it does not have sleepiness.

Among the twenty-two secondary passions, the ten are distinguished in terms of gross and subtle and the two natures of good and bad. Therefore the explanations in the two texts are not contradictory.
