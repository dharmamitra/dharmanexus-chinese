['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a13_12']	初、問起者，前已廣約譬喻、附文、當體釋金光明，足顯法性深廣圓融，今何更立觀心釋耶？	初、問起者，前已廣約譬喻、附文、當體釋金光明，足顯法性深廣圓融，今何更立觀心釋耶？	004	Second, the questioner, having already extensively explained the golden light using parables, textual references, and the inherent nature, is sufficient to reveal the profound, vast, and perfect interfusion of the Dharma nature. Why then establish the contemplation of the mind to explain it now?

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a15_21']	《妙玄》云「佛法太高，眾生法太廣，初心為難。	《妙玄》云「佛法太高，眾生法太廣，初心為難。	004	The Miaoxuan says: The Buddha Dharma is too lofty, and the Dharma of sentient beings is too vast. It is difficult for beginners.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a16_15']	心佛及眾生，是三無差別，觀心則易。	心佛及眾生，是三無差別，觀心則易。	004	The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings, these three are no different. Contemplating the mind is easy.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a17_19']	」今從上來至「不能開發自身寶藏」，是論佛法太高也。	」今從上來至「不能開發自身寶藏」，是論佛法太高也。	004	Now, from above to unable to open up one's own treasure store, this is discussing the Buddha Dharma as being too lofty.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a18_11']	從「今欲」下明觀心則易也。	從「今欲」下明觀心則易也。	004	From now I wish below, it clarifies that contemplating the mind is easy.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a20_12']	上來等者，即前譬等釋金光明，一一無非竪徹三位、遍該諸法，說眾生皆如菩提涅槃本性具足。	上來等者，即前譬等釋金光明，一一無非竪徹三位、遍該諸法，說眾生皆如菩提涅槃本性具足。	004	The above and so forth refers to the previous parables and so forth that explain the Golden Light, each and every one penetrating the three levels vertically and pervading all dharmas, explaining that all sentient beings are endowed with the fundamental nature of bodhi and nirvana.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a21_11']	此顯法性無量甚深，而但是佛所游之法。	此顯法性無量甚深，而但是佛所游之法。	004	This reveals the immeasurable and profound Dharma nature, which is only the Dharma that the Buddha traverses.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a23_2']	佛是聖人，金光明是聖寶，尚過菩薩所行清淨，豈是凡夫己之智分？	佛是聖人，金光明是聖寶，尚過菩薩所行清淨，豈是凡夫己之智分？	004	The Buddha is a sage, and the Golden Light is a sacred treasure, surpassing even the pure practice of bodhisattvas. How could it be within the cognitive capacity of ordinary beings?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a24_12']	若但言議上之名句，不能觀察己之心性，則於聖人聖寶有何益乎？	若但言議上之名句，不能觀察己之心性，則於聖人聖寶有何益乎？	004	If one only discusses the names and phrases above and is unable to contemplate the nature of one's own mind, then what benefit is there in the sage and the sage's treasure?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a25_13']	故引二喻斥其多聞無觀智者、鸚鵡學語者。	故引二喻斥其多聞無觀智者、鸚鵡學語者。	004	Therefore, two analogies are used to rebuke those who have much learning but lack the wisdom of contemplation, and those who parrot others.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a26_7']	〈曲禮〉云「鸚鵡能言，不離飛鳥；	〈曲禮〉云「鸚鵡能言，不離飛鳥；	004	The Quli says, A parrot can speak, but it does not escape being a flying bird;

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a27_9']	人而無禮，不亦禽獸之心乎！	人而無禮，不亦禽獸之心乎！	004	If a person lacks propriety, isn't it also the mind of an animal?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030a28_11']	」今但借喻有聞無觀，徒學聖言，不離凡夫之心耳。	」今但借喻有聞無觀，徒學聖言，不離凡夫之心耳。	004	Now, I am just using this as a metaphor for those who have heard but lack contemplation, who merely study the sage's words without leaving the mind of an ordinary person.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b01_4']	客作數錢者，《華嚴》云「譬如貧窮人，日夜數他寶，自無半錢分，多聞亦如是。	客作數錢者，《華嚴》云「譬如貧窮人，日夜數他寶，自無半錢分，多聞亦如是。	004	As for the guest worker counting money, the Huayan says, It is like a poor person counting others' wealth day and night, yet having not even a penny of their own. The same is true of much learning.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b01_19']	」今欲等者，攝前佛法入心成觀。	」今欲等者，攝前佛法入心成觀。	004	Now, to be equal means to include the Buddha Dharma in the mind and form contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b03_13']	心是心性，若陰若業若煩惱等即凡夫心地，既三障當體是金光明，故云珍寶。	心是心性，若陰若業若煩惱等即凡夫心地，既三障當體是金光明，故云珍寶。	004	The mind is the mind-nature. If it is the aggregates, karma, afflictions, etc., it is the ordinary person's mind-ground. Since the three hindrances are precisely the essence of the Golden Light, it is called precious treasure.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b05_14']	此乃立心為顯理境也，欲令行者即聞而修，開發自己金光明寶，免同學語、數錢之類也。	此乃立心為顯理境也，欲令行者即聞而修，開發自己金光明寶，免同學語、數錢之類也。	004	This establishes the mind as the realm of revealing the principle. It wishes to make the practitioner immediately cultivate upon hearing, to develop their own treasure of the Golden Light, and to avoid being like those who merely study the words and count money.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b05_19']	二、引證。	二、引證。	004	Second, citing evidence.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b06_15']	諸佛解脫者，三解脫也。	諸佛解脫者，三解脫也。	004	The liberation of all buddhas refers to the three liberations.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b07_8']	與十種三法不多不少，此是佛法。	與十種三法不多不少，此是佛法。	004	It is neither more nor less than the ten kinds of threefold dharmas, which are the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b08_2']	若緣佛修，則增念慮，理難可顯。	若緣佛修，則增念慮，理難可顯。	004	If one cultivates with the Buddha as the object, then thoughts increase and the principle is difficult to manifest.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b09_11']	故佛示要門，令諸眾生觀己心行即空假中，則三解脫當處發現。	故佛示要門，令諸眾生觀己心行即空假中，則三解脫當處發現。	004	Therefore, the Buddha shows the essential gateway, causing all sentient beings to contemplate their own mind's activities as empty, provisional, and the middle way, and then the three liberations will manifest right where they are.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b10_4']	此乃心佛無差觀心則易也。	此乃心佛無差觀心則易也。	004	This is because the mind and the Buddha are no different. Contemplating the mind is easy.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b10_11']	又引《釋論》。	又引《釋論》。	004	Moreover, it cites the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b11_20']	彼論九十三云「有慧無多聞，亦不知實相，譬如大闇中，有目無所見。	彼論九十三云「有慧無多聞，亦不知實相，譬如大闇中，有目無所見。	004	The treatise states, Having wisdom but lacking much learning, one also does not know the true nature. It is like being in great darkness, with eyes but nothing to see.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b13_3']	多聞無智慧，亦不見實相，譬如大明中，有燈而無照。	多聞無智慧，亦不見實相，譬如大明中，有燈而無照。	004	Having much learning but lacking wisdom, one also does not see the true nature. It is like being in great brightness, with a lamp but no illumination.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b13_15']	無聞無智慧，譬如人身牛。	無聞無智慧，譬如人身牛。	004	Lacking both learning and wisdom is like a person's body being like an ox.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b14_19']	」故《大論》云「如安息國邊地生人，雖生中國，不可教化。	」故《大論》云「如安息國邊地生人，雖生中國，不可教化。	004	Therefore, the Great Treatise says, Like the people born in the borderlands of the country of Anxi, even if born in the Central Kingdom, they cannot be taught and transformed.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b16_2']	根不具、支不完，不識義理、著邪見等，皆名人身牛也。	根不具、支不完，不識義理、著邪見等，皆名人身牛也。	004	Those with incomplete faculties, imperfect limbs, who do not recognize principles, who are attached to wrong views, and so forth, are all human bodies that are oxen.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b16_14']	有聞有智慧，是所說應受。	有聞有智慧，是所說應受。	004	Those who have heard and have wisdom are the ones who should accept what is taught.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b17_8']	如人有目，日光照，見種種色。	如人有目，日光照，見種種色。	004	It is like a person with eyes, illuminated by sunlight, seeing various colors.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b18_19']	」今亦如是，若聞上來種種釋金光明、不觀己心者，即多聞無慧句也。	」今亦如是，若聞上來種種釋金光明、不觀己心者，即多聞無慧句也。	004	Now it is also like this. If one hears the various explanations of the Golden Light but does not contemplate one's own mind, then it is the phrase much hearing without wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b19_19']	若但觀心、不聞圓融說者，即有慧無聞句也。	若但觀心、不聞圓融說者，即有慧無聞句也。	004	If one only contemplates the mind but does not hear the perfect and harmonious teachings, then it is the phrase having wisdom without hearing.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b21_12']	能攝上來無量甚深十種三法，觀於心性顯金光明者，即有聞有慧句也。	能攝上來無量甚深十種三法，觀於心性顯金光明者，即有聞有慧句也。	004	Being able to include the immeasurable and profound ten kinds of three dharmas mentioned above, contemplating the nature of the mind to reveal the Golden Light, is the phrase having heard and having wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b22_11']	有三觀目、圓教日照，則見三諦種種之色。	有三觀目、圓教日照，則見三諦種種之色。	004	Having the eyes of the three contemplations, illuminated by the sun of the perfect teaching, one then sees the various colors of the three truths.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b23_6']	二、明心為行要故觀必研心，二：	二、明心為行要故觀必研心，二：	004	Second, clarifying why the mind is the essential practice, therefore contemplation must investigate the mind, in two parts:
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b23_15']	初、約簡數觀王問。	初、約簡數觀王問。	004	First, asking about the mind-king in terms of the simplified number of mental factors.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b25_3']	若約三科論去就者，則棄界入但觀五陰，復於五陰簡四觀識。	若約三科論去就者，則棄界入但觀五陰，復於五陰簡四觀識。	004	If we discuss the abandonment and retention in terms of the three categories, then we discard the realms and entrances and only contemplate the five aggregates, and within the five aggregates, we select the consciousness aggregate for contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b26_2']	大師譚觀常論簡境，去丈就尺、去尺就寸。	大師譚觀常論簡境，去丈就尺、去尺就寸。	004	The Great Master's discussions of contemplation often discuss the selection of objects, abandoning the long and taking the short, abandoning the short and taking the inch.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b26_16']	義既可知，故今但約觀心為問。	義既可知，故今但約觀心為問。	004	Since the meaning is already understandable, I will now only ask about contemplating the mind.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b28_1']	既云觀心，五陰除色四皆屬心，何故棄三而獨觀識？	既云觀心，五陰除色四皆屬心，何故棄三而獨觀識？	004	Since it is said to contemplate the mind, the four aggregates of consciousness are all included in the mind, so why abandon the other three and only contemplate consciousness?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030b28_16']	然設此問，令知觀境唯在識陰也。	然設此問，令知觀境唯在識陰也。	004	However, this question is posed to make one understand that the contemplated object is only in the aggregate of consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c02_16']	孤山四意中，第二義疎破此文云「今家約行附法託事三種觀中，唯約行觀簡示陰境，其餘二種全不觀陰，但託事攝法明理觀耳。	孤山四意中，第二義疎破此文云「今家約行附法託事三種觀中，唯約行觀簡示陰境，其餘二種全不觀陰，但託事攝法明理觀耳。	004	In the four meanings of Gu Shan, the second meaning refutes this text, saying: In the three kinds of contemplation in our school, which are based on practice, the Dharma, and events, only the contemplation based on practice selects and demonstrates the objects of the aggregates. The other two kinds do not contemplate the aggregates at all, but only contemplate the principle of subsuming the Dharma and events.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c05_4']	今附法觀秖合直攝三法以歸三諦，而發棄三觀一之問者，蓋不知三種觀心規矩，驗是後人擅加也。	今附法觀秖合直攝三法以歸三諦，而發棄三觀一之問者，蓋不知三種觀心規矩，驗是後人擅加也。	004	Now, the attached dharma contemplation should only directly include the three dharmas and return them to the three truths, yet the question of abandoning the three contemplations and one is asked - this is because they do not know the standard of the three kinds of contemplating the mind, and it is verified that later people arbitrarily added it.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c05_8']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	004	The commentary says:
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c06_18']	《義例》立附法觀云「攝諸法相入一念心以為圓觀」，且一念心豈非陰耶？	《義例》立附法觀云「攝諸法相入一念心以為圓觀」，且一念心豈非陰耶？	004	The Yi Le establishes the attached dharma contemplation, saying to include all dharma characteristics into a single thought of the mind as the perfect contemplation. Moreover, isn't a single thought of the mind precisely the aggregates?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c07_9']	既觀於陰，簡有何過？	既觀於陰，簡有何過？	004	Since one contemplates the aggregates, what is wrong with the selection?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c09_13']	《法華文句》託靈鷲山觀於五陰，《記》云「諸餘觀境不出五陰」，今此山等約陰便故，以諸文中直云境智。	《法華文句》託靈鷲山觀於五陰，《記》云「諸餘觀境不出五陰」，今此山等約陰便故，以諸文中直云境智。	004	The Fa Hua Wen Ju contemplates the five aggregates based on Vulture Peak, and the Ji says the various other contemplated objects are not apart from the five aggregates. Now, this mountain and so forth are convenient based on the aggregates, so in the various texts it simply says objects and wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c11_15']	又云「亦應於此明方便正修簡境及心」，既諸觀境不出五陰，乃知託事及附法觀無不觀陰也。	又云「亦應於此明方便正修簡境及心」，既諸觀境不出五陰，乃知託事及附法觀無不觀陰也。	004	It also says one should also clarify the expedient practices, correct cultivation, selection of objects, and mind in this. Since the various contemplated objects are not apart from the five aggregates, one should know that the contemplated objects based on phenomena and the attached dharma contemplation are all contemplating the aggregates.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c12_17']	直云境智者，即諸文云「觀於一念即空假中」。	直云境智者，即諸文云「觀於一念即空假中」。	004	As for directly saying objects and wisdom, the various texts say contemplating emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle in a single thought.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c13_8']	一念是陰境，三觀是智也。	一念是陰境，三觀是智也。	004	A single thought is the object of the aggregates, and the three contemplations are wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c15_10']	又令明於方便正修簡境及心，須棄思議取不思議方名簡心，不於三科而論去取，安名簡境？	又令明於方便正修簡境及心，須棄思議取不思議方名簡心，不於三科而論去取，安名簡境？	004	Moreover, it is necessary to clarify the expedient correct cultivation, distinguish the objects, and the mind. One must abandon conceptualization and take the inconceivable in order to be called distinguishing the mind. Not discussing abandonment and acceptance within the three categories, how can it be called distinguishing the objects?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c16_10']	又王城觀云「應如止觀十乘十境，下去皆爾。	又王城觀云「應如止觀十乘十境，下去皆爾。	004	Moreover, the Wangcheng Guan says, It should be like the ten methods of contemplation and ten objects of contemplation in the Mohe Zhiguan. The same goes for the rest.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c19_6']	」記主意令講此觀時，人欲修者須敘私記簡陰境文及十乘等而委示之，令山城觀行法備足，非廢託事便自講說止觀全部。	」記主意令講此觀時，人欲修者須敘私記簡陰境文及十乘等而委示之，令山城觀行法備足，非廢託事便自講說止觀全部。	004	The main point of the commentary is that when lecturing on this contemplation, if people wish to cultivate it, they must explain the text on distinguishing the objects of the aggregates and the ten methods of contemplation in the private notes in detail, so that the methods of contemplation in the Wangcheng Guan are complete. It is not that one abandons the allegorical events and directly lectures on the entire Mohe Zhiguan.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c19_16']	他之致意，直欲如斯。	他之致意，直欲如斯。	004	The intention of others is simply to be like this.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c21_3']	既云「下去皆爾」，信諸託事及附法觀，皆須簡陰及示十乘也。	既云「下去皆爾」，信諸託事及附法觀，皆須簡陰及示十乘也。	004	Since it says the same goes for the rest, it is believed that all the allegorical events and the contemplation of the Dharma are all required to distinguish the aggregates and demonstrate the ten methods of contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c22_2']	彼文不簡尚令簡之，今有簡文那成非義？	彼文不簡尚令簡之，今有簡文那成非義？	004	That text does not distinguish, yet it still allows for distinction. Now that there is a distinguishing text, how can it not be the meaning?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c23_7']	據此棄三觀一之問云義疎者，義實不疎，蓋汝解疎耳。	據此棄三觀一之問云義疎者，義實不疎，蓋汝解疎耳。	004	Based on this, abandoning the three contemplations and taking one as the question of the meaning being far-fetched, the meaning is actually not far-fetched, it is just that your understanding is far-fetched.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c25_5']	又若直攝三法以歸三諦，不許簡陰便是觀心，則成偏觀清淨真如，何反宗之甚耶？	又若直攝三法以歸三諦，不許簡陰便是觀心，則成偏觀清淨真如，何反宗之甚耶？	004	Moreover, if one directly includes the three dharmas in the three truths, and does not allow for the selection of the aggregates as the contemplation of the mind, then it becomes the biased contemplation of pure suchness. How can this be so contrary to the fundamental teaching?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c27_4']	是知彼人都昧一家三種觀法，如釋《觀經》十六觀云「是一心三觀，的非《義例》三種觀攝。	是知彼人都昧一家三種觀法，如釋《觀經》十六觀云「是一心三觀，的非《義例》三種觀攝。	004	It should be known that this person is completely ignorant of the three kinds of contemplation methods of our school. When explaining the sixteen contemplations of the Guanjing, he says: This is the three contemplations of one mind, which are not included in the three kinds of contemplation of the Yili.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c27_22']	」且《義例》云「夫三觀者，義唯三種。	」且《義例》云「夫三觀者，義唯三種。	004	Moreover, the Yili says: As for the three contemplations, the meaning is only of three kinds.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c28_8']	」豈應妙觀更有異塗？	」豈應妙觀更有異塗？	004	How could it be that the wonderful contemplation has another path?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0030c29_12']	況諸文觀心，皆一家樞要，儻解之錯謬，徒成斐然。	況諸文觀心，皆一家樞要，儻解之錯謬，徒成斐然。	004	Moreover, the contemplation of the mind in various texts is all the essential point of our school. If the understanding of it is mistaken, it will only be a vain display.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0031a01_3']	既失其本，餘皆枝詞矣。	既失其本，餘皆枝詞矣。	004	Since it loses its foundation, the rest are all branches.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0031a02_13']	彼又於《金󱂸記》中云「若取止觀來消事法觀文，乃以止觀隨機面授。	彼又於《金󱂸記》中云「若取止觀來消事法觀文，乃以止觀隨機面授。	004	They also say in the Jinzhuji that if one takes the method of calming and contemplation to explain the text on the contemplation of phenomena, it is to use calming and contemplation according to the capacity of the person and impart it face-to-face.

He specifically demonstrated the two emptinesses regarding the realms of the provisional and the real, and extensively investigated the four natures within delusions and karma, causing the subjugation of views and thoughts and the non-arising of karmic burdens. He then demonstrated the wondrous three contemplations in the nine categories. When the coarse mind has ceased, the wondrous contemplation can be cultivated.

Therefore, citing Master ZHI's teaching that names and objects are both empty, it is proven that the body and names that are investigated now are originally empty and quiescent.

The correct and auxiliary practices are combined, and then within a single true characteristic of afflictions, what is followed is gold, the ability to follow is light, and the various numbers are clarity.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033b01_10']	今是觀行佛成道處，不觀舉足即空假中，安令此處是寂滅場，安能具足一切佛法？	今是觀行佛成道處，不觀舉足即空假中，安令此處是寂滅場，安能具足一切佛法？	004	Now, this is the place where the Buddha attained enlightenment through contemplation. If one does not contemplate raising the foot as empty, provisional, and middle, how can this place be the site of nirvana, and how can one fully possess all the Buddha's teachings?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033b02_8']	如此觀業，見業本際，方稱經文道場之說。	如此觀業，見業本際，方稱經文道場之說。	004	Observing karma like this, seeing the original point of karma, only then does it accord with the sutra text's explanation of the place of practice.

If one only engages in right contemplation, it will increase attachment. Therefore, auxiliary practices are established to temporarily use contemplation of emptiness to counteract this delusion.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033b19_11']	若今明六即，正辨行人全性起修，觀之成不、入位淺深，仍示因果皆金光明，故六皆名即。	若今明六即，正辨行人全性起修，觀之成不、入位淺深，仍示因果皆金光明，故六皆名即。	004	If the six identities are explained now, it is to distinguish how the practitioner completely uses the nature to give rise to cultivation, whether the contemplation is accomplished or not, and the shallowness or depth of entering the stages, and to show that the causes and effects are all the golden light. Therefore, the six are all called identities.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033b21_8']	觀親疎故即須論六，就即論六免生上慢、就六論即免生退屈，不慢不退妙位可階。	觀親疎故即須論六，就即論六免生上慢、就六論即免生退屈，不慢不退妙位可階。	004	Because of the closeness and distance of the contemplation, the six must be discussed. Discussing the six in terms of the identities prevents the arising of arrogance, and discussing the identities in terms of the six prevents the arising of discouragement. Without arrogance and without discouragement, one can ascend to the wondrous stages.

This stage has not yet entered the path of effortless function, and among the three non-retrogressions, mindfulness still regresses, therefore it is shown by opening and closing to indicate gain and loss.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c05_6']	其觀行位，三惑全在，於彼疎觀能安忍者則論相續，於無術者則有退失。	其觀行位，三惑全在，於彼疎觀能安忍者則論相續，於無術者則有退失。	004	In the stage of contemplation, the three delusions are all present. For those who can endure in the distant contemplation, it is said to be continuous. For those who lack skill, there is regression.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c06_5']	若相似位，見思已去，於親觀中而論得失。	若相似位，見思已去，於親觀中而論得失。	004	If in the stage of resemblance, the views and thoughts have already been removed, then the gains and losses are discussed in the intimate contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c07_2']	若能防護則速發真，名閉目則見。	若能防護則速發真，名閉目則見。	004	If one can guard against it, then one quickly gives rise to the true, called closing the eyes and seeing.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c07_17']	若起法愛則有頂墮，名開眼則失。	若起法愛則有頂墮，名開眼則失。	004	If one gives rise to attachment to the Dharma, then one falls to the peak of existence, called opening the eyes and losing.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c08_8']	不進為失，非退失也。	不進為失，非退失也。	004	Not progressing is a loss, not a regression.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c09_7']	大判意根，似解已立，故云治生不違實相。	大判意根，似解已立，故云治生不違實相。	004	Generally speaking, the faculty of thought has already been established in the stage of resemblance, so it is said that making a living does not contradict the true aspect.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c10_9']	細檢此位未破無明，若無住風息，名開眼則失。	細檢此位未破無明，若無住風息，名開眼則失。	004	If examined in detail, this stage has not yet broken through ignorance. If the wind of non-abiding ceases, it is called opening the eyes and losing.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c11_8']	分真位善入出住楞嚴三昧，故開閉皆見。	分真位善入出住楞嚴三昧，故開閉皆見。	004	In the stage of partial truth, one skillfully enters, exits, and abides in the samādhi of śūraṃgama, so opening and closing are both seeing.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c12_21']	彼云「且金光明本喻三德」。	彼云「且金光明本喻三德」。	004	They say, First, the Golden Light is originally a metaphor for the three virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c14_3']	前文尚作當體釋之，而相似之文翻作眼見金像釋之。	前文尚作當體釋之，而相似之文翻作眼見金像釋之。	004	The previous text still explains it as the inherent nature, but the similar text is explained as seeing a golden image with the eyes.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c15_1']	吾知其往者，竊取觀經六即，於茲謬說。	吾知其往者，竊取觀經六即，於茲謬說。	004	I know that in the past, they secretly took the six identities from the Contemplation Sutra and mistakenly explained it here.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c16_10']	彼明觀佛色身仍在觀行之位，故云開目閉目周眸遍覽無非佛界。	彼明觀佛色身仍在觀行之位，故云開目閉目周眸遍覽無非佛界。	004	They clarify that contemplating the Buddha's physical body is still in the stage of contemplation and practice, so it is said that whether one opens or closes the eyes, looking around is nothing but the Buddha realm.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c17_3']	吁可怪也，任作金像用義。	吁可怪也，任作金像用義。	004	Alas, it is strange. Let them use the meaning of the golden image.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c18_8']	且彼疏文是大師親說，觀行位者閉目開目境界常現。	且彼疏文是大師親說，觀行位者閉目開目境界常現。	004	Moreover, the text of that commentary was personally spoken by the great master. For those in the stage of contemplation and practice, the realm always appears whether one closes or opens the eyes.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c19_5']	何以今於相似證位而云開目則失？	何以今於相似證位而云開目則失？	004	Why is it now said that opening the eyes loses [the vision] in the stage of similarity and realization?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c19_14']	顛亂之說徒惑後學。	顛亂之說徒惑後學。	004	The confused explanations only delude later learners.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c20_18']	若其竊取《觀經疏》者，必不文相頓爾乖違。	若其竊取《觀經疏》者，必不文相頓爾乖違。	004	If they secretly took from the Contemplation Sutra commentary, then the text would not suddenly be so contradictory.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c21_2']	予今詳之。	予今詳之。	004	I will now examine it.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c22_7']	文違理順，闇者罔知，何則今於三道直觀理性金光明也。	文違理順，闇者罔知，何則今於三道直觀理性金光明也。	004	The text contradicts the principle, and the ignorant do not know. Why is it so? Now, in the three paths, one directly contemplates the principle of the golden light.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c23_12']	若《觀經疏》託彼佛身顯三諦理，雖俱圓觀，託境不同。	若《觀經疏》託彼佛身顯三諦理，雖俱圓觀，託境不同。	004	If the Commentary on the Contemplation Sutra relies on that Buddha's body to manifest the principle of the three truths, although both are perfect contemplations, the objects of reliance are different.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c24_14']	彼想色身以為事境，即於此境修空假中以為理觀。	彼想色身以為事境，即於此境修空假中以為理觀。	004	That thought of the form body is taken as the phenomenal realm, and in this realm, emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way are cultivated as the principle contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c26_12']	境觀雖於一念同修，而其事境是應物相觀中先發，故觀行位閉目開目常得見佛。	境觀雖於一念同修，而其事境是應物相觀中先發，故觀行位閉目開目常得見佛。	004	Although the phenomenal realm and contemplation are cultivated together in a single thought, the phenomenal realm is the response to the characteristics of beings, and the contemplation first arises in the middle way. Therefore, in the stage of contemplating the mind, whether the eyes are closed or open, one always sees the Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c27_16']	此顯三道金光明理登住方發，故相似位閉見開失。	此顯三道金光明理登住方發，故相似位閉見開失。	004	This manifests the principle of the golden light of the three paths, which is first attained in the stage of abiding. Therefore, in the stage of similarity, whether the eyes are closed or open, one loses the sight.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0033c29_10']	蓋以開閉用顯此位是似非真，良以此位尚須作意，登住方入無功用道。	蓋以開閉用顯此位是似非真，良以此位尚須作意，登住方入無功用道。	004	This is because the use of closing and opening the eyes manifests that this stage is similar but not true. The reason is that this stage still requires intention, and only in the stage of abiding does one enter the path of effortless function.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a01_4']	彼疏似位於妙三諦豈不然乎？	彼疏似位於妙三諦豈不然乎？	004	In that commentary, is it not the same for the wonderful three truths in the stage of similarity?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a02_3']	又復似位論開閉者，蓋約五眼，非獨肉眼。	又復似位論開閉者，蓋約五眼，非獨肉眼。	004	Moreover, as for discussing closing and opening in the stage of similarity, it is based on the five eyes, not just the physical eye.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a03_4']	既體上二惑任運先除，必二諦四眼此位先發。	既體上二惑任運先除，必二諦四眼此位先發。	004	Since the two delusions of the upper stage are spontaneously eliminated first, the four eyes of the two truths must be initially manifested in this stage.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a04_7']	若策四即佛，則稍同真見，亦速入真，名閉眼則見；	若策四即佛，則稍同真見，亦速入真，名閉眼則見；	004	If one encourages the four eyes to be like the Buddha, then it is slightly the same as the true view, and one also quickly enters the truth, called closing the eyes and seeing.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a05_8']	若任四眼則起法愛，呼為頂墮，故云開眼則失。	若任四眼則起法愛，呼為頂墮，故云開眼則失。	004	If one leaves the four eyes to give rise to attachment to the Dharma, it is called falling from the peak, so it is said opening the eyes and losing.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a06_2']	若不然者，離愛一法為被誰耶？	若不然者，離愛一法為被誰耶？	004	If it were not so, then whom would the one Dharma of leaving attachment be for?
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a07_6']	故《輔行》云「三諦之乳真善妙色，五眼洞開方見諦境。	故《輔行》云「三諦之乳真善妙色，五眼洞開方見諦境。	004	Therefore, the Fu Xiang says: The milk of the three truths is the true, good, and wonderful color. Only when the five eyes are fully opened can one see the realm of the truths.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a08_5']	」是則相似猶屬於盲，障中無明未破故也。	」是則相似猶屬於盲，障中無明未破故也。	004	This means that even in the stage of resemblance, one is still considered blind, because the ignorance within the obstructions has not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a09_13']	彼人全迷般舟觀法，佛身為境、空等為觀，一念之內難易淺深。	彼人全迷般舟觀法，佛身為境、空等為觀，一念之內難易淺深。	004	That person completely misunderstands the method of contemplating the Buddha's body in the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra. The Buddha's body is the object, and emptiness, etc. are the contemplations. Within a single thought, there are differences in difficulty and depth.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a10_7']	而却妄斥此作眼見金像釋之。	而却妄斥此作眼見金像釋之。	004	Yet he recklessly slanders this as explaining it as seeing the golden image with the eyes.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a11_2']	相似開失，觀行俱見，謂之顛亂。	相似開失，觀行俱見，謂之顛亂。	004	In the stage of resemblance, both opening and losing are seen in contemplation and practice, which is called confusion.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a12_2']	若論不解事理淺深，則顛亂之責須歸己也。	若論不解事理淺深，則顛亂之責須歸己也。	004	If we discuss the shallow and deep understanding of principles and phenomena, then the blame for confusion must be returned to oneself.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a12_13']	又見與不見，妙旨難知。	又見與不見，妙旨難知。	004	Moreover, seeing and not seeing, the wonderful meaning is difficult to know.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a14_8']	如《法華》四信弟子聞經信解，即能見佛常在靈山，文殊等覺不修三昧不見妙音。	如《法華》四信弟子聞經信解，即能見佛常在靈山，文殊等覺不修三昧不見妙音。	004	As in the Lotus Sutra, the four types of faithful disciples hear the sutra and understand it, and are able to see the Buddha always dwelling on Vulture Peak, while Manjushri and those of equal enlightenment do not cultivate samadhi and do not see Wonderful Sound.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a15_17']	此經樹神覩佛禮塔、為眾詢疑，及至讚佛哀泣雨淚請佛現身。	此經樹神覩佛禮塔、為眾詢疑，及至讚佛哀泣雨淚請佛現身。	004	In this sutra, the tree spirit sees the Buddha, pays homage to the stupa, and inquires about the doubts of the assembly, and then praises the Buddha and weeps tears of sorrow, requesting the Buddha to manifest his body.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a17_3']	此之經義，忽有一本無如是文，他必謂之後人擅加耳。	此之經義，忽有一本無如是文，他必謂之後人擅加耳。	004	In this sutra, there is suddenly a version without such text, and others will certainly say that it was later added by someone.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a17_11']	二、觀三釋，三：	二、觀三釋，三：	004	Second, contemplating the three explanations, there are three:

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a19_5']	十種三法皆可當體名金光明，以十種三法無不具於貴等義故。	十種三法皆可當體名金光明，以十種三法無不具於貴等義故。	004	The ten kinds of three dharmas can all be called the Golden Light, because the ten kinds of three dharmas are all endowed with the meanings of preciousness, etc.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a19_18']	是故今云觀心三識論金光明。	是故今云觀心三識論金光明。	004	Therefore, it is now said that the three consciousnesses of contemplating the mind discuss the Golden Light.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a20_8']	二、附法作觀，三：	二、附法作觀，三：	004	Second, attaching to the Dharma to make contemplation, there are three:
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a20_15']	初、略示境觀。	初、略示境觀。	004	First, briefly demonstrating the realm and contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a21_15']	一念，心境也，即空假中觀也，即是觀心識於三識者。	一念，心境也，即空假中觀也，即是觀心識於三識者。	004	One thought is the mind and objects, which is the contemplation of emptiness, provisional existence, and the Middle Way, which is the contemplation of the mind and consciousness in the three consciousnesses.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a22_19']	三識本來是妙三觀，九界忘本，識隨妄轉不識本性。	三識本來是妙三觀，九界忘本，識隨妄轉不識本性。	004	The three consciousnesses are originally the wonderful three contemplations, but the nine realms forget their origin, and consciousness follows false turning without recognizing its original nature.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a23_19']	今順性修觀，觀無別體，即以本識識本識也。	今順性修觀，觀無別體，即以本識識本識也。	004	Now, in accordance with nature, cultivation of contemplation, contemplation has no separate substance, but uses the original consciousness to recognize the original consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a24_8']	二、廣陳觀相，二：	二、廣陳觀相，二：	004	Second, extensively presenting the characteristics of contemplation, in two parts:
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a24_18']	初、明一心三觀，三：	初、明一心三觀，三：	004	First, clarifying the one mind and three contemplations, in three parts:
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a24_22']	初、空。	初、空。	004	First, emptiness.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a25_16']	三識沈隱，其相難知，而不暫離第六意識。	三識沈隱，其相難知，而不暫離第六意識。	004	The three consciousnesses are submerged and hidden, their characteristics are difficult to know, and they are not temporarily separated from the sixth consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a26_19']	此識緣外，故以意根對塵為緣，推於四性不在一處。	此識緣外，故以意根對塵為緣，推於四性不在一處。	004	This consciousness arises from external conditions, so it uses the mental faculty to confront objects as conditions. Analyzing the four natures, they are not in one place.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a28_19']	即以四性而為眾緣，從此緣生，生即無生，故云「我說即是空」也，空無分別即阿梨耶識。	即以四性而為眾緣，從此緣生，生即無生，故云「我說即是空」也，空無分別即阿梨耶識。	004	Then, using the four natures as the many conditions, arising from these conditions, arising is non-arising, therefore it is said I say it is emptiness. Emptiness is without discrimination, which is the ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a29_1']	二、假。	二、假。	004	Second, provisional existence.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034a29_11']	眾緣生故，空無性相；	眾緣生故，空無性相；	004	Because it arises from many conditions, emptiness has no nature or characteristics;

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b02_7']	惡即四趣，善即人天，非善惡識通於四聖，此四俱非有漏善惡。	惡即四趣，善即人天，非善惡識通於四聖，此四俱非有漏善惡。	004	Evil refers to the four destinies, good refers to humans and gods, and neither good nor evil consciousness applies to the four holy ones. None of these four is contaminated good or evil.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b03_2']	於彼空中順緣起性種種觀察。	於彼空中順緣起性種種觀察。	004	In that emptiness, one observes various phenomena in accordance with the nature of dependent origination.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b04_1']	於空假立，故謂之強。	於空假立，故謂之強。	004	Because it is provisionally established in emptiness, it is called forced.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b04_12']	此觀立法，即阿陀那識。	此觀立法，即阿陀那識。	004	This contemplation establishes the dharma, which is the ālaya consciousness.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b06_1']	是故根立，識亦立也。	是故根立，識亦立也。	004	Therefore, when the faculty is established, the consciousness is also established.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b08_1']	心性不動本來中實，不可思議，而體具足空與不空二種功德，故體及德成圓三識。	心性不動本來中實，不可思議，而體具足空與不空二種功德，故體及德成圓三識。	004	the nature of the mind is unmoving, originally real in the middle, inconceivable, and yet its essence is replete with the two kinds of merits of emptiness and non-emptiness, therefore the essence and virtues form the perfect three consciousnesses.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b10_3']	故雖觀空而不定空，雖觀於假而不定假，即現前識絕二邊相、能所叵得，此觀即是菴摩羅識。	故雖觀空而不定空，雖觀於假而不定假，即現前識絕二邊相、能所叵得，此觀即是菴摩羅識。	004	Therefore, although contemplating emptiness, one does not fixate on emptiness; although contemplating the provisional, one does not fixate on the provisional. The present consciousness transcends the characteristics of the two extremes, and subject and object cannot be obtained. This contemplation is precisely the Āmalaka consciousness.

['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b13_17']	觀色等五即是觀俗，觀五皆如即是觀空，觀五即性是觀中也。	觀色等五即是觀俗，觀五皆如即是觀空，觀五即性是觀中也。	004	Contemplating the five such as form is precisely contemplating the conventional; contemplating the suchness of the five is precisely contemplating emptiness; contemplating the five as nature is precisely contemplating the middle.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b15_4']	今皆云不觀者，即於此三無觀無得，名約三觀即照而亡。	今皆云不觀者，即於此三無觀無得，名約三觀即照而亡。	004	Now, all saying not contemplating means that within these three there is no contemplation and no attainment. This is called forgetting while illuminating based on the three contemplations.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b15_18']	經明五陰，今但於識忘三觀也。	經明五陰，今但於識忘三觀也。	004	The sūtra clarifies the five aggregates, but now it only forgets the three contemplations within consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b16_5']	二、明即亡而照。	二、明即亡而照。	004	Second, clarifying illuminating while forgetting.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b17_9']	雖於識心忘於能所，而三境觀了了分明，故云不濫。	雖於識心忘於能所，而三境觀了了分明，故云不濫。	004	Although one forgets the subject and object in the conscious mind, the three realms and contemplations are clearly distinct, so it is said to be non-overlapping.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b18_9']	而言雙照者，以識識如乃是二邊，識性是中。	而言雙照者，以識識如乃是二邊，識性是中。	004	As for saying both illuminating and extinguishing, the consciousness of suchness is the two extremes, and the nature of consciousness is the middle.
['ZH_T39_1784_004:0034b19_11']	今頓觀三諦，即中邊雙照，驗不得三，是雙亡也。	今頓觀三諦，即中邊雙照，驗不得三，是雙亡也。	004	Now, suddenly contemplating the three truths is precisely the simultaneous illumination of the middle and extremes. Examining that one cannot attain the three is the simultaneous extinction.
