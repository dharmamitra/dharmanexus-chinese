['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696b23_1']	此不還者總說有七，且行色界差別有五：	此不還者總說有七，且行色界差別有五：	In general, there are seven types of non-returners. Those who proceed to the form realm are of five types:
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696b24_11']	一中般涅槃、二生般涅槃、三有行般涅槃、四無行般涅槃、五者上流。	一中般涅槃、二生般涅槃、三有行般涅槃、四無行般涅槃、五者上流。	1. those who attain parinirvāṇa in the intermediate state, 2. those who attain parinirvāṇa upon birth, 3. those who attain parinirvāṇa through practice, 4. those who attain parinirvāṇa without practice, 5. those who go upstream.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696b25_10']	此於中間般涅槃故，說此名曰中般涅槃。	此於中間般涅槃故，說此名曰中般涅槃。	Because they attain nirvana in the middle, they are called those who attain nirvana in the middle.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696b27_7']	如是應知，此於生已、此由有行、此由無行般涅槃故，名生般等，此上流故名為上流。	如是應知，此於生已、此由有行、此由無行般涅槃故，名生般等，此上流故名為上流。	In this way, it should be understood that because they attain nirvana after birth, through practice, and without practice, they are called those who attain nirvana after birth, etc. Because they go to a higher realm, they are called those who go to a higher realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696b28_16']	言中般者，謂有一類補特伽羅，已於生結得非擇滅，起結不爾。	言中般者，謂有一類補特伽羅，已於生結得非擇滅，起結不爾。	As for those who attain nirvana in the middle, there is a type of person who has attained the cessation of discernment of the bonds of birth, but not so for the bonds of arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c03_11']	彼於欲界遇逼惱緣之所逼惱，便能自勉修斷餘結殊勝加行，加行未滿遇捨命緣遂致命終，由起結力受色中有，厭多苦故乘前起道進斷餘結，成阿羅漢得般涅槃。	彼於欲界遇逼惱緣之所逼惱，便能自勉修斷餘結殊勝加行，加行未滿遇捨命緣遂致命終，由起結力受色中有，厭多苦故乘前起道進斷餘結，成阿羅漢得般涅槃。	When they encounter conditions that afflict the desire realm, they are able to encourage themselves to cultivate the superior practice of severing the remaining bonds. Before the practice is complete, they encounter conditions that cause them to lose their life and thus end their life. By the power of the bonds of arising, they receive a form intermediate existence. Because they are disgusted with much suffering, they advance the path that arose previously to sever the remaining bonds, accomplish arhatship, and attain parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c06_17']	言生般者，謂有一類補特伽羅，由先具造順起生業及增長故，欲界沒已受色界生，由具勤修速進道故，生已不久成阿羅漢，盡其壽量方般涅槃。	言生般者，謂有一類補特伽羅，由先具造順起生業及增長故，欲界沒已受色界生，由具勤修速進道故，生已不久成阿羅漢，盡其壽量方般涅槃。	As for those who attain parinirvāṇa through birth, there is a type of person who, due to having previously completed karma that accords with birth and has increased it, falls from the desire realm and receives birth in the form realm. Due to possessing the practice of the path of swift progress, after being born for not a long time they become arhats and then attain parinirvāṇa by exhausting their life span.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c08_6']	約有餘依說為生般，非纔生已便般無餘，彼捨壽中無自在故。	約有餘依說為生般，非纔生已便般無餘，彼捨壽中無自在故。	Based on the remaining support, it is said that they attain parinirvāṇa through birth. It is not that as soon as they are born they attain parinirvāṇa without remainder, because they lack mastery in the middle of abandoning life.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c11_3']	言有行般無行般者，謂有一類補特伽羅，生已多時方成無學，於中有一勇猛精進、有一稟性慢緩懈怠，如次名為有行無行。	言有行般無行般者，謂有一類補特伽羅，生已多時方成無學，於中有一勇猛精進、有一稟性慢緩懈怠，如次名為有行無行。	As for those who attain parinirvāṇa through practice and those who attain parinirvāṇa without practice, there is a type of person who, after being born for a long time, then becomes a post-learner. Among them, there is one who is vigorous in effort and one who is by nature slow and lazy. They are respectively called those who practice and those who do not practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c14_2']	謂若一類先欲界中依不息加行三摩地力，斷五下分結成不還果，後生色界經於多時，還能進修前種類道成阿羅漢，名有行般；	謂若一類先欲界中依不息加行三摩地力，斷五下分結成不還果，後生色界經於多時，還能進修前種類道成阿羅漢，名有行般；	That is, if one first in the realm of desire, by the power of samādhi that does not rest in the practice of added effort, severs the five lower bonds and becomes an anāgāmin, and later, born in the realm of form, after many days, he is still able to cultivate the path of the same kind and become an arhat, he is called one who attains nirvāṇa through practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c14_11']	無行般者與此相違。	無行般者與此相違。	One who attains nirvāṇa without practice is the opposite of this.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c16_8']	或色界生經多時已，依止苦行解脫餘結名有行般，以彼修習依功用道般涅槃故；	或色界生經多時已，依止苦行解脫餘結名有行般，以彼修習依功用道般涅槃故；	Or, after being born in the realm of form for many days, he relies on the practice of suffering and is liberated from the remaining bonds, and is called one who attains nirvāṇa through practice, because he cultivates and attains nirvāṇa by means of the path that relies on effort.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c16_17']	與此相違名無行般。	與此相違名無行般。	The opposite of this is called one who attains nirvāṇa without practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c18_7']	豈不中般、生般、現般所依止行亦有此故，應立有行、無行般名？	豈不中般、生般、現般所依止行亦有此故，應立有行、無行般名？	Isn’t it the case that the practices relied on by those who attain nirvāṇa in the intermediate state, those who attain nirvāṇa after birth, and those who attain nirvāṇa through manifestation also have these two kinds? Therefore, the names of those who attain nirvāṇa through practice and those who attain nirvāṇa without practice should be established?
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c19_5']	無如是失，此義雖等而彼各有差別位故。	無如是失，此義雖等而彼各有差別位故。	There is no such error, because although the meaning is the same, they each have different stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c21_3']	謂中般等雖亦定依苦行樂行解脫餘結，而彼各有分位不同，對此名為不共差別；	謂中般等雖亦定依苦行樂行解脫餘結，而彼各有分位不同，對此名為不共差別；	That is, although those who attain nirvāṇa in the intermediate state, etc., also definitely rely on the practice of suffering and the practice of pleasure to be liberated from the remaining bonds, they each have different stages, and in contrast to this, they are called different in the sense of not being common;
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c22_11']	此無如是分位別故，約道不同顯其差別，如何以此例彼令同？	此無如是分位別故，約道不同顯其差別，如何以此例彼令同？	Because the formless realm does not have such a distinction of stages, the difference is shown by the difference in paths. How can this be used as an example to make them the same?
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c23_1']	故於此中所辯無失。	故於此中所辯無失。	Therefore, there is no error in the explanation here.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c24_17']	由此有說二差別者，由緣有為、無為聖道，如其次第得涅槃故，應知亦無餘同此失。	由此有說二差別者，由緣有為、無為聖道，如其次第得涅槃故，應知亦無餘同此失。	Because of this, some say that the two are distinguished because they attain nirvana in sequence by relying on the conditioned and unconditioned noble paths. One should know that there is also no other error that is the same as this.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c28_4']	經主所難有大過失，為已善通此義雖等，而彼各有差別位故，然有經說無行在先，亦有經中先說有行，時既無異隨說無違，有行可尊故我先說。	經主所難有大過失，為已善通此義雖等，而彼各有差別位故，然有經說無行在先，亦有經中先說有行，時既無異隨說無違，有行可尊故我先說。	The difficulty raised by the master of the treatise has a great error. Although this meaning is well explained, because each has a different stage, there is a sutra that says there is no practice first, and there is also a sutra that first speaks of having practice. Since the time is no different, following the explanation there is no contradiction. Because having practice can be respected, I first explain it.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0696c29_12']	言上流者，謂有一類補特伽羅上流行增，非初生處即證圓寂。	言上流者，謂有一類補特伽羅上流行增，非初生處即證圓寂。	As for the one who goes upstream, it refers to a type of person whose practice of going upstream increases, and who does not realize complete nirvana in the first place of birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a02_1']	謂欲界沒往色界生，未即於中能證圓寂，要轉生上方般涅槃。	謂欲界沒往色界生，未即於中能證圓寂，要轉生上方般涅槃。	It means that after passing away from the desire realm and being reborn in the form realm, one is not yet able to realize complete nirvana in that realm, but only after being reborn in a higher realm can one attain parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a02_19']	即此上流差別有二，由因及果有差別故。	即此上流差別有二，由因及果有差別故。	This upper stream is divided into two, because of differences in cause and effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a03_17']	因差別者，此於靜慮由有雜修無雜修故。	因差別者，此於靜慮由有雜修無雜修故。	The difference in cause is that it is due to the presence or absence of mixed cultivation of the trance states.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a04_16']	果差別者，色究竟天及有頂天為極處故。	果差別者，色究竟天及有頂天為極處故。	The difference in effect is that the highest heaven of the form realm and the peak of existence are the ultimate destinations.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a06_7']	謂若於靜慮有雜修者，能往色究竟方般涅槃，雜修能感淨居果故。	謂若於靜慮有雜修者，能往色究竟方般涅槃，雜修能感淨居果故。	That is, if one has mixed cultivation of the trance states, one can go to the highest heaven of the form realm and attain nirvana there, because mixed cultivation can bring about the result of rebirth in the Pure Abodes.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a07_7', 'ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a10_13']	即此復有三種差別，全超、半超、遍沒異故。🔽言全超者，謂色界中從一處沒往色究竟，由彼先在欲界身中已具雜修四種靜慮，遇緣退失上三靜慮，以初靜慮愛味為緣，命終上生梵眾天處。	即此復有三種差別，全超、半超、遍沒異故。 言全超者，謂色界中從一處沒往色究竟，由彼先在欲界身中已具雜修四種靜慮，遇緣退失上三靜慮，以初靜慮愛味為緣，命終上生梵眾天處。	This is further divided into three kinds, because of the differences of complete transcendence, partial transcendence, and complete submergence.🔽As for complete transcendence, it means that in the form realm one passes away from one place and goes to the highest heaven of the form realm. This is because in a previous existence in the desire realm one had already cultivated the four kinds of trance states, but due to encountering conditions one lost the upper three trance states. Taking the craving for the first trance state as a condition, one's life ends and one is reborn in the Brahma assembly heaven.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a12_2']	由於先世串習勢力，復能雜修第四靜慮，從彼處沒生色究竟。	由於先世串習勢力，復能雜修第四靜慮，從彼處沒生色究竟。	Due to the power of being thoroughly familiar with the previous world, one is again able to cultivate the fourth trance state, and passes away from that place and is reborn in the highest heaven of the form realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a13_11']	以於色界十六處所，最初處沒、最後處生，頓越中間，是全超義。	以於色界十六處所，最初處沒、最後處生，頓越中間，是全超義。	The meaning of complete transcendence is that one first dies in the first of the sixteen heavens of the form realm and is finally reborn in the last of the sixteen heavens, suddenly transcending the intermediate heavens.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a15_17']	言半超者，謂色界中從初天等，漸次而沒下至中間，能越一處方能往趣色究竟天，超而非全，是半超義。	言半超者，謂色界中從初天等，漸次而沒下至中間，能越一處方能往趣色究竟天，超而非全，是半超義。	The meaning of partial transcendence is that one dies in the first of the sixteen heavens of the form realm and is reborn in the intermediate heavens, and then one is able to transcend one heaven and go to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. This is partial transcendence.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a19_12']	言遍沒者，謂於色界愛味多故一切處生，由彼遍於四靜慮地十六處所，一一皆有下等愛味為感生緣，從梵眾天一一處所一生沒已至色究竟方般涅槃，故名遍沒。	言遍沒者，謂於色界愛味多故一切處生，由彼遍於四靜慮地十六處所，一一皆有下等愛味為感生緣，從梵眾天一一處所一生沒已至色究竟方般涅槃，故名遍沒。	The meaning of complete death is that because one has much craving for the pleasures of the form realm, one is reborn in all the heavens. Because one has craving for the lower heavens in each of the sixteen heavens of the four meditations, this becomes the condition for rebirth. One dies in each of the heavens, from the Brahmakāyika Heaven, and only then attains parinirvāṇa in the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. Therefore it is called complete death.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a21_3']	由此義准，初靜慮中大梵所居非是別處，即是第二梵輔天攝。	由此義准，初靜慮中大梵所居非是別處，即是第二梵輔天攝。	By this meaning, it is inferred that the place where Mahābrahmā resides in the first meditation is not a separate place, but is included in the second heaven of Brahmapurohita.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a22_12']	若異此者，大梵所居僻見處故、一導師故，必無聖者於中受生。	若異此者，大梵所居僻見處故、一導師故，必無聖者於中受生。	If this were not so, then the abode of the great Brahma would be a place of false views, and there would be no saints who would be reborn there as leaders.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a23_2']	遍沒、半超應無差別。	遍沒、半超應無差別。	If this were not so, then there would be no difference between the two kinds of nonreturners who die in the lower stages and are reborn in the upper stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a25_8']	應知此謂二上流中，由有雜修靜慮因故往色究竟般涅槃者，餘於靜慮無雜修者能往有頂方般涅槃。	應知此謂二上流中，由有雜修靜慮因故往色究竟般涅槃者，餘於靜慮無雜修者能往有頂方般涅槃。	You should know that of the two kinds of upper stream winners, those who have mixed the four meditations and are reborn in the heaven of the most in the course of evolution and enter nirvana there are called those who go to the peak of existence. Those who do not mix the meditations and are reborn in the heaven of the most in the course of evolution and enter nirvana there are called those who go to the highest.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a27_6']	謂彼先無雜修靜慮，由於諸定愛味為緣，此沒遍生色界諸處，唯不能往五淨居天。	謂彼先無雜修靜慮，由於諸定愛味為緣，此沒遍生色界諸處，唯不能往五淨居天。	That is, they do not mix the meditations in advance, and because of craving for the various samādhis, they die in the lower stages and are reborn in all the heavens of the realm of form, but they are unable to go to the five pure heavens.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a28_10']	色界命終，於三無色次第生已，後生有頂方般涅槃。	色界命終，於三無色次第生已，後生有頂方般涅槃。	When they die in the realm of form, they are reborn in the three heavens of the formless realm in order, and finally they are reborn in the heaven of the ultimate material form and enter nirvana there.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697a29_13']	二上流中前是觀行、後是止行，樂慧樂定有差別故。	二上流中前是觀行、後是止行，樂慧樂定有差別故。	Of the two kinds of upper stream winners, the former are contemplatives and the latter are practitioners of tranquillization, because they delight in wisdom and delight in samādhi, respectively.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b02_11']	二上流者於下地中得般涅槃，亦不違理，而言此往色究竟天及有頂天，依極處說。	二上流者於下地中得般涅槃，亦不違理，而言此往色究竟天及有頂天，依極處說。	It is also reasonable to say that nonreturners who proceed to the upper levels attain nirvana in the lower levels. However, the text says that they go to the highest heaven of the form realm and the highest heaven of the formless realm, because these are the highest places.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b04_8']	無不還者於已生處受第二生，由彼於生容求勝進非等劣故，唯欲界沒往色界生。	無不還者於已生處受第二生，由彼於生容求勝進非等劣故，唯欲界沒往色界生。	Nonreturners do not take a second rebirth in the place where they were born, because they seek a superior rebirth, not one that is equal or inferior. They only die in the realm of desire and are reborn in the form realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b05_16', 'ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b07_5']	有中有中般涅槃者，非色界沒生色界者，以色界中無災害故。🔽若本有位有餘障緣不得涅槃，中有亦爾，中有薄劣非本有故。	有中有中般涅槃者，非色界沒生色界者，以色界中無災害故。 若本有位有餘障緣不得涅槃，中有亦爾，中有薄劣非本有故。	There are those who attain nirvana in the intermediate state, but not those who die in the form realm and are reborn in the form realm, because there is no disaster in the form realm.🔽If there are remaining obstacles in the prior existence that prevent nirvana, the same is true of the intermediate state. The intermediate state is inferior to the prior existence, and therefore, if there are obstacles in the prior existence, there must also be obstacles in the intermediate state.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b08_4']	又彼若有，應屬上流，中般上流應無差別。	又彼若有，應屬上流，中般上流應無差別。	Moreover, if there is an intermediate state, it must belong to the class of nonreturners who proceed to the upper levels, and there would be no difference between those who attain nirvana in the intermediate state and those who proceed to the upper levels.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b08_17']	謂定無有差別因緣可作是言：	謂定無有差別因緣可作是言：	That is to say, there is no reason to make the distinction that
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b09_11']	唯欲界沒受色中有便般涅槃。	唯欲界沒受色中有便般涅槃。	only those who die in the realm of desire and are reborn in the form realm in the intermediate state attain nirvana.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b11_1']	得中般名非色界沒，何緣有學未離欲貪，無中有中般涅槃者？	得中般名非色界沒，何緣有學未離欲貪，無中有中般涅槃者？	Those who attain parinirvāṇa in the intermediate state are not reborn in the form realm. Why is it that those still learning who have not yet eliminated desire are not reborn in the intermediate state and attain parinirvāṇa?
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b11_19']	欲界中有依身微劣，於多事業無堪能故。	欲界中有依身微劣，於多事業無堪能故。	Because the body of the intermediate state in the desire realm is weak and lacks the ability to perform many activities.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b13_7']	住本有位，於欲界法尚難越度，況中有中能越欲界至得應果。	住本有位，於欲界法尚難越度，況中有中能越欲界至得應果。	While in the original state of existence, it is difficult to transcend the dharmas of the desire realm, much less be able to transcend the desire realm and attain the fruit of arhatship in the intermediate state.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b14_15']	多事業者，謂越三界及永斷除二種煩惱，并得二三沙門果證；	多事業者，謂越三界及永斷除二種煩惱，并得二三沙門果證；	Many activities refer to transcending the three realms, permanently eliminating the two kinds of afflictions, and attaining the second and third fruits of the śramaṇa;
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b15_5']	住中有位無如是能。	住中有位無如是能。	while in the intermediate state, one lacks this ability.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b16_4']	又此有前未曾數習九品差別煩惱治故。	又此有前未曾數習九品差別煩惱治故。	Moreover, one has not yet repeatedly cultivated the antidotes to the nine grades of afflictions before this existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b18_4']	又不還等果非中有身得，斷增上惑所證得故，離三界染極為難故，無欲中有能般涅槃。	又不還等果非中有身得，斷增上惑所證得故，離三界染極為難故，無欲中有能般涅槃。	Also, the fruits such as non-returner are not attained in the body of the intermediate state, because they are attained through eliminating the dominant afflictions, and it is extremely difficult to be free from the defilements of the three realms. There is no desire in the intermediate state that can attain parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0697b19_3']	色界中有與此皆異，故有於中得涅槃者。	色界中有與此皆異，故有於中得涅槃者。	The intermediate state in the form realm is different from this, so there are those who attain parinirvāṇa in the intermediate state.

['ZH_T29_1562_065:0698b21_19']	諸欲雜修四靜慮者，必先雜修第四靜慮，以彼等持最堪能故，諸樂行中彼最勝故。	諸欲雜修四靜慮者，必先雜修第四靜慮，以彼等持最堪能故，諸樂行中彼最勝故。	Those who wish to mix and cultivate the four meditations must first mix and cultivate the fourth meditation, because that samādhi is the most capable, and among the various practices of happiness, it is the most supreme.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0698b25_5']	謂彼靜慮最有堪能，現在前時，令所依止自體勢力增長廣大，故若依彼雜修靜慮，後雖退失生餘天中，由於先時雜修彼力，復能依彼雜修靜慮。	謂彼靜慮最有堪能，現在前時，令所依止自體勢力增長廣大，故若依彼雜修靜慮，後雖退失生餘天中，由於先時雜修彼力，復能依彼雜修靜慮。	That is to say, that meditation has the greatest capability. When it appears in the present, it causes the power of the basis and essence to increase and expand greatly. Therefore, if one relies on that to mix and cultivate meditation, even if one later retrogresses and is reborn in other heavens, due to the power of having previously mixed and cultivated that, one is still able to rely on that to mix and cultivate meditation.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0698b26_13']	即由此理，第四靜慮諸樂行中最為殊勝，彼輕安樂極上妙故。	即由此理，第四靜慮諸樂行中最為殊勝，彼輕安樂極上妙故。	It is precisely by this principle that among the various practices of happiness in the fourth meditation, it is the most supreme, because that comfort and happiness is extremely sublime.

There, one must again be free from the passions of the three meditations in order to be able to again cultivate the various meditations. Having fallen from there, one is then reborn in the Pure Abodes and is then called one who goes upstream.

There is no such error, because it is not admitted that they abide in the faculty of having attained the results of the stages of the path of insight from the beginning.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0698c09_1']	謂彼先住信解種性，雜修靜慮然後退失，彼懼於後復有退時，便修練根成見至性。	謂彼先住信解種性，雜修靜慮然後退失，彼懼於後復有退時，便修練根成見至性。	That is, they first abide in the spiritual family of faith and understanding, cultivate the various meditations, and then fall back and lose them. They then cultivate the refinement of the faculties and perfect the spiritual family of having attained the results of the stages of the path of insight, fearing that they will fall back again later.

From this, they induce many moments of the impure path, and then many moments of the pure path appear again. In this way, they continue to reduce the moments of the pure path one by one until finally two moments of the pure path appear, and then they induce two moments of the impure path. Immediately after this, two moments of the pure path appear again. This is called the completion of the preparatory path of the mixed cultivation of the trance states.

Consequently, the various cultivations of the meditations would not be fully accomplished. This is because it does not arise immediately after the knowledge of dharmas of suffering and its cause, the knowledge of the species of cessation and path, nor do these knowledges arise immediately after it.

There is a separate general contemplation, and therefore there are one hundred and sixty-four in the first six stages. In the stage of infinite space there are fifty-two, in the stage of infinite consciousness there are thirty-six, and in the stage of nothingness there are twenty-four.

['ZH_T29_1562_065:0700c03_4']	此定既能斷有頂地第九品惑，能引此惑盡，得俱行盡智，令起金剛喻定，是斷惑中最後無間道所生盡智，是斷惑中最後解脫道，故說此定所引盡智與第九品盡得俱起。	此定既能斷有頂地第九品惑，能引此惑盡，得俱行盡智，令起金剛喻定，是斷惑中最後無間道所生盡智，是斷惑中最後解脫道，故說此定所引盡智與第九品盡得俱起。	Since this samādhi can eliminate the ninth category of the passions of the summit of existence, it can attract the knowledge of the exhaustion of the passions that accompanies the elimination of the passions, and causes the diamond-like samādhi to arise. This knowledge of the exhaustion of the passions that is born from the diamond-like samādhi is the final uninterrupted path in the elimination of the passions, and this knowledge of the exhaustion of the passions is the final path of liberation in the elimination of the passions. Therefore it is said that the knowledge of the exhaustion of the passions attracted by this samādhi arises simultaneously with the possession of the exhaustion of the ninth category of the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0700c04_11']	或此盡言顯一切盡，謂第九品及所餘惑皆得擇滅故名為盡。	或此盡言顯一切盡，謂第九品及所餘惑皆得擇滅故名為盡。	Or, this word exhaustion manifests all exhaustions, that is, the ninth category of passions and the remaining passions, all of which are called exhausted because they are extinguished by the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1562_065:0700c06_10']	金剛喻定能引諸惑盡得俱行盡智令起，此與一切煩惱盡得最初俱生，故名盡智。	金剛喻定能引諸惑盡得俱行盡智令起，此與一切煩惱盡得最初俱生，故名盡智。	The diamond-like samādhi can attract the knowledge of the exhaustion of the passions that accompanies the possession of the exhaustion of the passions and causes it to arise. This knowledge arises simultaneously with the possession of the exhaustion of all passions for the first time, and therefore it is called knowledge of the exhaustion of the passions.

There is no separate fruit that is to be cultivated and learned, and therefore he is called one who has nothing more to learn. The earlier explanation is without error.
