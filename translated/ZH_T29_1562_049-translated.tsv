['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b05_20']	不遍隨眠差別亦二，謂有漏、無漏緣。	不遍隨眠差別亦二，謂有漏、無漏緣。	Non-pervading latent tendencies are also of two kinds: with contaminated objects and with pure objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b07_3']	且遍行中自界地者，普於五部自界地法所緣隨增。	且遍行中自界地者，普於五部自界地法所緣隨增。	As for the omnipresent ones, those of the same realm and stage universally increase in the five classes of dharmas of the same realm and stage as their object.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b08_7']	不遍行中有漏緣者，唯於自部自界地法所緣隨增。	不遍行中有漏緣者，唯於自部自界地法所緣隨增。	As for the non-omnipresent ones with impure objects, they only increase in the dharmas of the same class and realm as their object.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b09_15']	不遍行中無漏緣者及遍行中他界緣者，於所緣境無隨增義。	不遍行中無漏緣者及遍行中他界緣者，於所緣境無隨增義。	As for the non-omnipresent ones with pure objects and the omnipresent ones with objects of other realms, they have no meaning of increasing in their objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b10_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b10_14']	彼所緣境非所攝受及相違故。	彼所緣境非所攝受及相違故。	Because their objects are neither appropriated nor opposed.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b12_13']	謂若有法為此地中身見及愛攝為己有，可有為此身見愛地中所有隨眠所緣隨增理。	謂若有法為此地中身見及愛攝為己有，可有為此身見愛地中所有隨眠所緣隨增理。	That is to say, if a dharma is appropriated as one's own by the view of self and craving of a certain stage, then it is reasonable that the latent tendencies of all dharmas in that stage of the view of self and craving increase in it as their object.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b15_3']	言隨增者，謂諸隨眠於此法中隨住增長，即是隨縛增惛滯義，如衣有潤塵隨住中，如有潤田種子增長。	言隨增者，謂諸隨眠於此法中隨住增長，即是隨縛增惛滯義，如衣有潤塵隨住中，如有潤田種子增長。	As for increasing, it means that the latent tendencies abide and increase in this dharma, which is the meaning of following and binding, like dust abiding in moisture. It is like seeds increasing in moist fields.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b17_6']	非諸無漏及上地法，為諸下身見愛攝為己有，故緣彼下惑非所緣隨增，以不隨縛增惛滯故。	非諸無漏及上地法，為諸下身見愛攝為己有，故緣彼下惑非所緣隨增，以不隨縛增惛滯故。	The view of a self and craving do not grasp as self and as mine the pure dharmas and the dharmas of a higher stage, and therefore the defilements of a lower stage are not associated with the pure dharmas and the dharmas of a higher stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b18_14']	若下地生求上地等，是善法欲非謂染污，為求離染此欲生故。	若下地生求上地等，是善法欲非謂染污，為求離染此欲生故。	When one who is born in a lower stage seeks the pure path and a higher stage, this is a wholesome volition and not a defiled volition, because this volition arises in order to seek separation from defilement.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b20_5']	聖道涅槃及上地法，與能緣彼下惑相違，故彼二亦無所緣隨增理。	聖道涅槃及上地法，與能緣彼下惑相違，故彼二亦無所緣隨增理。	The pure path and the dharmas of a higher stage are opposed to the lower defilements that can take them as objects, and therefore the pure path and the dharmas of a higher stage are also not objects that increase the lower defilements.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b20_15']	如於炎石，足不隨住；	如於炎石，足不隨住；	It is just as the foot does not remain on a hot stove,
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b21_4']	如火焰中鵝不增長。	如火焰中鵝不增長。	and a swan does not grow in a flame.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b22_3']	此隨眠起親由所依，然正起時兼託彼境。	此隨眠起親由所依，然正起時兼託彼境。	The arising of these propensities is directly due to the support, but when they are actually present, they are also based on the object.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b22_12']	如是已辯所緣隨增。	如是已辯所緣隨增。	This concludes the discussion of objects that increase defilement.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b23_11']	隨何隨眠於相應法由相應故於彼隨增？	隨何隨眠於相應法由相應故於彼隨增？	With regard to associated dharmas, which defilements increase through association?
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b24_11']	所說隨增，謂至未斷，故初頌首摽未斷言。	所說隨增，謂至未斷，故初頌首摽未斷言。	The increase of defilements mentioned above is due to their not being eliminated, and therefore the first verse says, Not yet eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b26_10']	由此應知諸緣無漏他界他煩惱唯相應隨增，諸緣有漏自界地遍具有所緣相應隨增。	由此應知諸緣無漏他界他煩惱唯相應隨增，諸緣有漏自界地遍具有所緣相應隨增。	Therefore you should understand that all conditions of the uncontaminated, other realms, and other passions are only associated and increase through objects. All conditions of the contaminated, one’s own realm and stage, and the universal vasa are both objects and associates and increase through objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b27_9']	如何隨眠於相應法及所緣境有隨增義？	如何隨眠於相應法及所緣境有隨增義？	How do the propensities have the meaning of increasing through association with dharmas and through objects?
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b28_1']	先軌𥰳師作如是說：	先軌𥰳師作如是說：	The ancient masters of the Abhidharma say this:
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616b28_19']	如城邑側有雜穢聚，糞水土等所共合成。	如城邑側有雜穢聚，糞水土等所共合成。	It is like a heap of filth beside a city, composed of excrement, water, and earth, etc.,
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c01_16']	於此聚中由糞過失，令水土等亦成不淨，由水等力令糞轉增，更互相依皆甚可惡。	於此聚中由糞過失，令水土等亦成不淨，由水等力令糞轉增，更互相依皆甚可惡。	that are combined. Because of the fault of the excrement, the water and earth, etc., become impure. Because of the power of the water, etc., the excrement increases and becomes even more foul.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c03_14']	如是煩惱相應聚中，由煩惱力染心心所，煩惱由彼勢力轉增，更互相依皆成穢污。	如是煩惱相應聚中，由煩惱力染心心所，煩惱由彼勢力轉增，更互相依皆成穢污。	In the same way, in the aggregate associated with the passions, mind and mental functions are defiled by the power of the passions. The passions increase in power because of them and become even more foul.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c04_13']	此聚相續穢污漸增，亦令隨行生等成染。	此聚相續穢污漸增，亦令隨行生等成染。	The continuity of this aggregate increases defilement gradually and also defiles the associated forces of birth, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c06_11']	如猪犬等居雜穢聚，生極耽樂眠戲其中，糞穢所塗轉增不淨，復由猪等穢聚漸增。	如猪犬等居雜穢聚，生極耽樂眠戲其中，糞穢所塗轉增不淨，復由猪等穢聚漸增。	It is like pigs and dogs, etc., who live in a heap of filth and are born with extreme delight in sleeping and playing in it. Covered with filth, they increase in impurity. Moreover, because of pigs, etc., the heap of filth gradually increases.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c08_8']	如是所緣自地有漏，由煩惱力有漏義成，彼復有能順煩惱力，令其三品相次漸增。	如是所緣自地有漏，由煩惱力有漏義成，彼復有能順煩惱力，令其三品相次漸增。	In the same way, the object of one's own stage, which is contaminated, becomes contaminated by the power of the defilements. They in turn have the power to assist the defilements, causing the three grades to gradually increase in sequence.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c09_16']	如滑淨人誤墮穢聚，雖觸糞穢而非所增，人亦無能增彼穢聚。	如滑淨人誤墮穢聚，雖觸糞穢而非所增，人亦無能增彼穢聚。	It is like a smooth and clean person who mistakenly falls into a heap of filth. Although they come into contact with the filth, they are not increased by it, and the person is also unable to increase that heap of filth.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c11_5']	如是無漏異界地法，雖有亦被煩惱所緣，而彼相望互無增義。	如是無漏異界地法，雖有亦被煩惱所緣，而彼相望互無增義。	In the same way, although the uncontaminated dharmas of different realms and stages are also objects of the defilements, they do not mutually increase each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c12_4']	此緣無漏異地隨眠，但由相應有隨增理。	此緣無漏異地隨眠，但由相應有隨增理。	The latent tendencies of the uncontaminated dharmas of different stages, which are objects of this [mind], are only increased by association.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c12_13']	有餘於此復作是說：	有餘於此復作是說：	Others explain this as follows:
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c13_14']	如酒雜毒，酷烈轉增，毒勢亦增，功能等故。	如酒雜毒，酷烈轉增，毒勢亦增，功能等故。	Just as alcohol mixed with poison becomes extremely strong and increases, and the power of the poison also increases, because their functions are equal,
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c14_12']	如是有漏與諸煩惱相助俱增，功能等故。	如是有漏與諸煩惱相助俱增，功能等故。	in the same way, contaminated dharmas assist the defilements and increase together with them, because their functions are equal.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c15_11']	如以良藥置諸毒中，令毒功能有損無益。	如以良藥置諸毒中，令毒功能有損無益。	It is like good medicine placed among poisons, which causes the poisonous potency to be diminished and ineffective.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c17_8']	如是無漏雖被惑緣，令惑功能有損無益，故緣無漏有邪見生，而彼無能斷善根力。	如是無漏雖被惑緣，令惑功能有損無益，故緣無漏有邪見生，而彼無能斷善根力。	In the same way, although the pure [mind] is the object of the passions, it causes the potency of the passions to be diminished and ineffective. Therefore, although there is a wrong view that takes the pure as its object, it is not able to sever the good roots.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c18_12']	亦有至教顯諸隨眠有無漏緣無隨增理，如契經說：	亦有至教顯諸隨眠有無漏緣無隨增理，如契經說：	There is also a clear teaching that shows that the latent propensities have pure objects but do not increase by being associated with them. A scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c19_2']	苾芻當知，疑食者何？	苾芻當知，疑食者何？	Bhikṣus should know that what is eaten by doubt?
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c20_5']	所謂三世，於過去世有惑有疑，現在未來說亦如是。	所謂三世，於過去世有惑有疑，現在未來說亦如是。	Namely, the three times. In the past, there are delusions and doubts, and the same is said of the present and future.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c21_4']	無為雖是煩惱所緣，非所隨增，故此不說。	無為雖是煩惱所緣，非所隨增，故此不說。	Although the unconditioned is the object of the passions, it is not what is increased by being associated with them. Therefore, this is not discussed here.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c22_3']	既不說此無漏有為，准此亦應非疑所食。	既不說此無漏有為，准此亦應非疑所食。	Since the pure conditioned is not discussed, by analogy it should also not be what is eaten by doubt.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c23_12']	如經總說諸行無常，理實於中唯說有漏法，以於後說彼寂為樂。	如經總說諸行無常，理實於中唯說有漏法，以於後說彼寂為樂。	Just as a scripture generally says that all conditioned things are impermanent, in reality it only discusses the dharmas with outflows, because later it says that their cessation is bliss.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c24_14']	故本論亦言無漏緣煩惱隨增，唯有相應非所緣。	故本論亦言無漏緣煩惱隨增，唯有相應非所緣。	Therefore the Abhidharmapitaka also says that the contaminants that take the pure as objects increase through association, not through taking as objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c25_14']	去來隨眠有隨增，不應言定有，能發得故。	去來隨眠有隨增，不應言定有，能發得故。	As for past and future contaminants, they increase through possession. It is not necessary to say that they definitely increase through taking as objects, because they can be acquired by instigation.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c26_11']	若異此者，諸異生類無染心位應離隨眠。	若異此者，諸異生類無染心位應離隨眠。	If this were not so, then when ordinary beings are in a state of mind not associated with the passions, they would be free from contaminants.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c26_16']	然世尊言：	然世尊言：	However, the World Honored One has said:
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c28_1']	幼稚童子嬰孩眠病，雖無染欲而有欲貪隨眠隨增。	幼稚童子嬰孩眠病，雖無染欲而有欲貪隨眠隨增。	“Even though infants, children, and the sick are not associated with desire, they have the contaminant of desire that increases through possession.”
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0616c29_17']	故說隨增乃至未斷，若彼已斷則無所緣相應隨增隨眠，寧有彼猶不失隨眠相故。	故說隨增乃至未斷，若彼已斷則無所緣相應隨增隨眠，寧有彼猶不失隨眠相故。	Therefore it is said that contaminants increase until they are eliminated. If they are eliminated, then they do not increase through taking as objects or through association. How can it be said that they still exist? Because they still have the characteristics of contaminants.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a02_6']	謂由對治壞其勢力故不隨增，然彼隨眠體相不失故言猶有。	謂由對治壞其勢力故不隨增，然彼隨眠體相不失故言猶有。	That is, because their power is destroyed by the antidote, they do not increase. However, the substance of the contaminants is not lost, and therefore it is said that they still exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a04_4']	或據曾當有此用故，今雖無用亦號隨眠，如失國王猶存王號，工匠停作其名尚存。	或據曾當有此用故，今雖無用亦號隨眠，如失國王猶存王號，工匠停作其名尚存。	Or, because they once had this function and will have it again, they are still called contaminants, even though they do not have it now, just as a deposed king is still called a king, and a craftsman who has stopped work is still called by his trade.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a04_13']	上座此中作如是說：	上座此中作如是說：	The elder Vasumitra says in this matter:
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a06_2']	隨眠無有相應所緣二隨增義，但有自性於相續中隨縛不捨。	隨眠無有相應所緣二隨增義，但有自性於相續中隨縛不捨。	The latent afflictions do not have the two meanings of being associated and having objects as their objects, but they only have their own nature, which binds the continuum without being abandoned.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a07_1']	為有自體隨縛相續、為有有性無自體耶？	為有自體隨縛相續、為有有性無自體耶？	Is there a self-nature that binds the continuum, or is there an existent nature without a self-nature?

['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a07_19']	唯有有性諸纏可有相應所緣。	唯有有性諸纏可有相應所緣。	Only the existent nature of the afflictions can have association and objects as their objects.

['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a16_7']	若謂彼能招異熟果，應上二界有非愛受，染招愛受理不成故。	若謂彼能招異熟果，應上二界有非愛受，染招愛受理不成故。	If you say that it can summon retribution, then there must be unpleasant feeling in the upper two realms, because it is not reasonable that defiled dharmas summon pleasant feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a17_6']	然無聖道成無記失，唯有漏法有異熟故。	然無聖道成無記失，唯有漏法有異熟故。	However, there is no error in saying that it is indeterminate because it is not the holy path, because only impure dharmas have retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_049:0617a18_5']	此種類中無異熟者，方可說為無記性故。	此種類中無異熟者，方可說為無記性故。	Only those dharmas that have no retribution in this class can be said to be indeterminate.

It is the same with the passions of the realm of form and the formless realm. Because the power of the passions is different, they are not only able to attract retribution that is painful feeling.

Therefore, you should admit that there is a cause of evil retribution that has no result, or you should admit that there is a place in the upper realms where one experiences unpleasant results.
