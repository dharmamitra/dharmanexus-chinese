['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c01_18']	「古本翻高士」者，古翻此經也，升出凡小故名高士。	「古本翻高士」者，古翻此經也，升出凡小故名高士。	The ancient version translates it as 'noble person' means the ancient translation of this sūtra. Because it rises above ordinary people and the two vehicles, it is called a noble person.

['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c08_19']	答中意，前云不得名薩埵者，以無別圓薩埵義故。	答中意，前云不得名薩埵者，以無別圓薩埵義故。	The meaning of the answer is that the previous statement that they cannot be called sattvas is because they do not have the meaning of the Distinct and Perfect sattvas.
['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c10_7']	今云少有慈悲等者，藏通菩薩亦有慈悲，但異二乘，得名菩薩。	今云少有慈悲等者，藏通菩薩亦有慈悲，但異二乘，得名菩薩。	Now, saying there are few with compassion, etc. means that the bodhisattvas of the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings also have compassion, but they differ from the two vehicles and can be called bodhisattvas.

['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c12_8']	但藏通菩薩觀行同小，故別斥之。	但藏通菩薩觀行同小，故別斥之。	But because the bodhisattvas of the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings practice contemplation the same as the Small Vehicle, they are specifically criticized.
['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c12_18']	通得名者，各從當教。	通得名者，各從當教。	The Shared Teaching can be called bodhisattva according to its own teaching.

['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c16_13']	通乃斥三，別唯訶藏。	通乃斥三，別唯訶藏。	The Shared [Teaching] is criticized as being the three [vehicles], while the Distinct [Teaching] only reprimands the Tripiṭaka [Teaching].
['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c17_12']	故使通別有歎有斥，三藏唯斥、圓教唯歎。	故使通別有歎有斥，三藏唯斥、圓教唯歎。	Therefore, the Shared and Distinct [Teachings] have both praise and reprimand, while the Tripiṭaka [Teaching] only has reprimand and the Perfect Teaching only has praise.
['ZH_T38_1779_002:0729c18_1']	通斥語寬，非教正體。	通斥語寬，非教正體。	General criticism has a broad meaning, and is not the main body of the teaching.
