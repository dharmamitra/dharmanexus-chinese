['ZH_T36_1736_004:0025b10_4']	若約機說者，染就劣機見故、淨就勝機見故、俱約二人同見故，剎體自在故俱，非約頓機故，亦唯約體故。	若約機說者，染就劣機見故、淨就勝機見故、俱約二人同見故，剎體自在故俱，非約頓機故，亦唯約體故。	004	If it is explained according to the capacities of beings, defilement is seen by inferior capacities, purity is seen by superior capacities, both are seen by the same two people, and the realm is sovereign, so both are not about sudden capacities, and are also only about the essence.

['ZH_T36_1736_004:0025c07_21']	《旨歸》文云「事盡理現，染相盡故。	《旨歸》文云「事盡理現，染相盡故。	004	The text of the Conclusion says: When phenomena are exhausted, principle manifests, because the defiled characteristics are exhausted.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0025c09_1']	」其該剎塵與遍塵道，並皆是塵，故第七中攝。	」其該剎塵與遍塵道，並皆是塵，故第七中攝。	004	Encompassing the dust of lands and pervading the paths of dust are both dust, so they are included in the seventh.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0025c11_9']	八重攝剎者，亦名華藏中塵一一攝餘剎海，亦不異於第六該諸剎塵，故並略之而加四五六以成十義。	八重攝剎者，亦名華藏中塵一一攝餘剎海，亦不異於第六該諸剎塵，故並略之而加四五六以成十義。	004	As for the eight layers of encompassing lands, it is also called each dust mote in the Flower Treasury encompassing the other oceans of lands. It is also no different from the sixth encompassing the dust of all lands, so they are both omitted, and four, five, and six are added to form ten meanings.

['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027b11_6']	疏「夫真身寥廓與法界合其體」者，若以法界為身，法界即身，不言合體。	疏「夫真身寥廓與法界合其體」者，若以法界為身，法界即身，不言合體。	004	The commentary states, The true body is vast and expansive, merging with the Dharma realm in its essence. If the Dharma realm is taken as the body, the Dharma realm is precisely the body, not speaking of merging with the essence.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027b12_3']	今以無障礙智與如冥一，故言合體。	今以無障礙智與如冥一，故言合體。	004	Now, because unobstructed wisdom merges with suchness, it is said to merge with the essence.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027b13_8']	故《金光明》云「唯如如及如如智獨存」，則以如智共為真身。	故《金光明》云「唯如如及如如智獨存」，則以如智共為真身。	004	Therefore, the Golden Light Sūtra says, Only suchness and suchness wisdom alone remain, taking suchness wisdom together as the true body.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027b14_7']	既智合如，則令色相功德無不合如。	既智合如，則令色相功德無不合如。	004	Since wisdom is united with suchness, it causes the merits and virtues of form to be united with suchness.

Since the essence is united with suchness, and suchness is omnipresent and all-encompassing, it causes the Buddha's body to also be all-encompassing.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027b17_3']	萬化云云，即是法身大用。	萬化云云，即是法身大用。	004	As for myriad transformations and so forth, this is the great function of the Dharma body.

['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027b26_11']	由經論中一多異說故，經隨物異、論逐經通、人隨教執；	由經論中一多異說故，經隨物異、論逐經通、人隨教執；	004	Because the sūtras and treatises have different explanations of one and many, the sūtras follow the differences in beings, the treatises follow the sūtras to explain, and people follow the teachings and grasp at them.

['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027c18_10']	二應身非化，謂地前菩薩所見佛身，依定而現，非五趣攝，名應非化，即四善根所見一大千界一應身也。	二應身非化，謂地前菩薩所見佛身，依定而現，非五趣攝，名應非化，即四善根所見一大千界一應身也。	004	The second is the response body that is not the transformation, which refers to the Buddha body seen by bodhisattvas below the ten grounds, which appears based on concentration and is not included in the five destinies, called response but not transformation, which is the one response body seen by the four roots of goodness in one great trichiliocosm.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027c20_7']	三亦應亦化，謂諸聲聞所見佛身，見相修成故名為應，人見同類故名為化。	三亦應亦化，謂諸聲聞所見佛身，見相修成故名為應，人見同類故名為化。	004	The third is both response and transformation, which refers to the Buddha body seen by the śrāvakas, called response because it is seen as cultivated through the practice of characteristics, and called transformation because it is seen as the same type of being.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027c21_1']	四非應非化，謂佛真身。	四非應非化，謂佛真身。	004	The fourth is neither response nor transformation, which refers to the true body of the Buddha.

['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027c22_18']	一受用非變化，謂自受用身。	一受用非變化，謂自受用身。	004	The first is enjoyment but not transformation, which refers to the body of self-enjoyment.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0027c23_17']	二變化身非受用，謂變化身，化地前類。	二變化身非受用，謂變化身，化地前類。	004	The second is transformation but not enjoyment, which refers to the transformation body, which transforms those below the ground stage.

['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a02_7']	詳而辯之，即一法身也。	詳而辯之，即一法身也。	004	If examined and distinguished, they are the one Dharma body.

['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a03_6']	言其生，則本之法性，故曰法性生身。	言其生，則本之法性，故曰法性生身。	004	Speaking of its birth, it is traced back to the nature of dharmas, therefore it is called the body born of the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a04_6']	二推其因，則是功德所成，故是功德法身。	二推其因，則是功德所成，故是功德法身。	004	Second, investigating its causes, it is then accomplished by merits, therefore it is the body of merit and virtue.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a05_6']	三就其應，則無感不形，是則變化法身。	三就其應，則無感不形，是則變化法身。	004	Third, in terms of its response, it manifests without fail when there is an object to be transformed, therefore it is the body of transformation.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a06_5']	四稱其大，則彌綸虛空，所謂虛空法身。	四稱其大，則彌綸虛空，所謂虛空法身。	004	Fourth, calling it great, it pervades the void, which is called the body of space.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a07_4']	五語其妙，則無相無為，故曰實相法身。	五語其妙，則無相無為，故曰實相法身。	004	Fifth, speaking of its subtlety, it is signless and unconditioned, therefore it is called the body of reality.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a09_1']	五所以能妙極無相，四大包虛空，三遍應萬化無感不形者，就機而明。	五所以能妙極無相，四大包虛空，三遍應萬化無感不形者，就機而明。	004	The reasons why it can be subtle and ultimate, signless, pervade space, and respond to all transformations without fail when there is an object to be transformed, are explained in terms of the capacities of sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a09_4']	何者？	何者？	004	Why is it so?
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a10_5']	三有之形隨業而化，故有精麁大小萬殊之差。	三有之形隨業而化，故有精麁大小萬殊之差。	004	The forms of the three realms of existence transform according to karma, therefore there are differences in refinement, coarseness, size, and myriad distinctions.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a11_8']	二如來法身，是妙功德果，功德無邊，果亦無邊；	二如來法身，是妙功德果，功德無邊，果亦無邊；	004	Second, the Dharma body of the Tathāgata is the fruition of wondrous merits and virtues. Merits and virtues are boundless, and the fruition is also boundless;

Because it is signless, its wondrousness is the same as the true nature of dharmas. Because it is skillful means, there is no stimulus that it does not respond to. This is the true wondrous Dharma body of the Tathāgata, not subsumed within the aggregates and elements, neither existent nor nonexistent.

This is called the true Dharma body.
['ZH_T36_1736_004:0028a19_1']	若直指功德實相名為法身，此乃以法深理假名為身，非色像之謂也。	若直指功德實相名為法身，此乃以法深理假名為身，非色像之謂也。	004	If one directly points to the true nature of merit and virtue as the Dharma body, this is using the profound principle of Dharma as a provisional name for the body, not referring to form and appearance.
