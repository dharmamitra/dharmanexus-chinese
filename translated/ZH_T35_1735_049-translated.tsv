['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c17_0', 'ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c18_0']	唐清涼山大華嚴寺沙門澄觀撰🔽37 如來出現品1如來出現品第三十七已下入第五十經	唐清涼山大華嚴寺沙門澄觀撰 37 如來出現品1如來出現品第三十七已下入第五十經	Composed by Chengguan, a monk from the Great Flower Ornament Monastery on Mount Qingliang in the Tang Dynasty
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c20_2']	初來意者，前品明稱果之因，此品辨如因之果。	初來意者，前品明稱果之因，此品辨如因之果。	First, the reason for the chapter: the previous chapter clarifies the cause of the fruition of praise, while this chapter discusses the fruition of suchness as the cause.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c21_2']	體雖平等不壞二相，先因後果義次第故。	體雖平等不壞二相，先因後果義次第故。	Although the essence is equal, the two aspects are not destroyed. The meaning is in sequence, first cause and then effect.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c22_6']	亦為答前〈不思議品〉出現念故、答第二會所行問故。	亦為答前〈不思議品〉出現念故、答第二會所行問故。	It is also to answer the thought of appearance in the previous chapter on the inconceivable, and to answer the question on practice in the second assembly.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c22_11']	會釋如前。	會釋如前。	The reconciliation and explanation are as before.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c23_14']	二釋名者，如來是有法之人，即三身十身之通稱。	二釋名者，如來是有法之人，即三身十身之通稱。	Second, the explanation of the names: the Tathāgata is the person who possesses the Dharma, which is a general term for the three bodies and ten bodies.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c24_12']	出現是依人之法，果用化用之總名。	出現是依人之法，果用化用之總名。	Appearance is the Dharma that relies on the person, a general name for the fruitional function and transformative function.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c26_3']	如來雖見上文，對〈出現〉故，重辨十身皆有出現，且寄三身以明。	如來雖見上文，對〈出現〉故，重辨十身皆有出現，且寄三身以明。	Although the Tathāgata is seen in the previous text, it is contrasted with appearance, so the ten bodies are all distinguished as appearing, and for now they are distinguished based on the three bodies.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c27_4']	然來即出現，為分人、法曉喻分明，故重辨之。	然來即出現，為分人、法曉喻分明，故重辨之。	However, coming is the same as appearance, but in order to distinguish the person and Dharma and make the analogy clear, it is distinguished again.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0871c29_17']	若依法身如來者，即諸法如義如理常現名為出現，故文云「普現一切而無所現」，又云「體性平等不增減」等。	若依法身如來者，即諸法如義如理常現名為出現，故文云「普現一切而無所現」，又云「體性平等不增減」等。	If based on the Dharma body of the Tathāgata, then the meaning of suchness of all dharmas and the principle of suchness are always manifested, which is called appearance. Therefore, the text says, Universally appearing in everything, yet nothing appears, and also says, The essence is equal, neither increasing nor decreasing.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a04_5']	若依報身，乘如實道來成正覺故曰如來，本性功德一時頓顯名為出現，故文云「如來成正覺時，於一切義無所疑惑，普見一切眾生成正覺」等。	若依報身，乘如實道來成正覺故曰如來，本性功德一時頓顯名為出現，故文云「如來成正覺時，於一切義無所疑惑，普見一切眾生成正覺」等。	If based on the reward body, then riding the path of suchness to achieve perfect enlightenment is called the Tathāgata. The originally inherent merits and virtues are all manifested at once, which is called appearance. Therefore, the text says, When the Tathāgata achieves perfect enlightenment, he is free from doubt regarding all matters, and universally sees all sentient beings achieving perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a05_16']	若依化身，則乘薩婆若乘來化眾生故曰如來，則應機大用一時出現。	若依化身，則乘薩婆若乘來化眾生故曰如來，則應機大用一時出現。	If based on the transformation body, then riding the vehicle of omniscience to transform sentient beings is called the Tathāgata. The great function in response to capacities appears all at once.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a08_7']	文云「以本願力現佛身，令見如來大神變」，又云「隨其所能、隨其勢力，於菩提樹下，以種種身成正覺」等。	文云「以本願力現佛身，令見如來大神變」，又云「隨其所能、隨其勢力，於菩提樹下，以種種身成正覺」等。	The text says, By the power of original vows, manifesting the Buddha body, causing them to see the Tathāgata's great spiritual powers, and also says, According to their abilities and powers, under the bodhi tree, manifesting perfect enlightenment with various bodies.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a11_10']	今以新佛舊成曾無二體，新成舊佛法報似分、無不應時故即真而應，應隨性起故即應而真，三佛圓融十身無礙，故辨應現即顯真成。	今以新佛舊成曾無二體，新成舊佛法報似分、無不應時故即真而應，應隨性起故即應而真，三佛圓融十身無礙，故辨應現即顯真成。	Now, the newly enlightened Buddha and the formerly accomplished Buddha have never had two bodies. The newly accomplished Buddha's Dharma-body and reward-body seem to be divided, but there is no time when they are not in accord. Therefore, the true is manifested in the response, and the response arises according to the nature, so the response is the same as the true. The three Buddhas are perfectly integrated, and the ten bodies are unobstructed. Therefore, explaining the manifestation of the response body reveals the accomplishment of the true.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a14_14']	是以晉經名性起，性字雖是義加，未爽通理，以應雖從緣，不違性故，無不從此法界流故，以淨奪染性即起故，若離於緣性叵說故。	是以晉經名性起，性字雖是義加，未爽通理，以應雖從緣，不違性故，無不從此法界流故，以淨奪染性即起故，若離於緣性叵說故。	Therefore, the Jin edition is called nature arising. Although the character nature is added in meaning, it does not go against the general principle, because although the response arises from conditions, it does not contradict the nature, because nothing does not flow from this Dharma realm, because purity subdues defilement and nature is arising, and because if one departs from conditions, nature cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a15_17']	下加性起菩薩，表所說故，妄雖即真不順性故。	下加性起菩薩，表所說故，妄雖即真不順性故。	Below, the Bodhisattva of Nature Arising is added to represent what is being spoken. Although delusion is identical to truth, it does not accord with nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a17_6']	今以起義多含，直云出現，從性從因、從真從感皆出現故。	今以起義多含，直云出現，從性從因、從真從感皆出現故。	Now, since the meaning of arising contains much, it is simply called manifestation. Arising from nature, arising from causes, arising from truth, and arising from response are all manifestations.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a19_1']	若唯辨應身出現，非唯失前二義，亦未足顯深，何能融前差別之果？	若唯辨應身出現，非唯失前二義，亦未足顯深，何能融前差別之果？	If one only explains the manifestation of the response body, not only does it lose the previous two meanings, it is also not sufficient to reveal the profundity. How can it integrate the differentiated fruits of the past?
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a20_1']	若以來為現義，則如來即出現，持業釋也。	若以來為現義，則如來即出現，持業釋也。	If the past is taken as the present meaning, then the Tathāgata is the appearance, which is a compound word.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a20_19']	若分人法，三皆如來之出現，揀餘出故。	若分人法，三皆如來之出現，揀餘出故。	If the person and dharma are distinguished, then the three are the appearance of the Tathāgata, distinguishing it from other appearances.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a22_1']	第三宗趣者，平等出現為宗，融差別果為趣。	第三宗趣者，平等出現為宗，融差別果為趣。	The third is the purport. Equality is the purport, and the merging of differentiated fruits is the goal.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0872a22_6']	四正釋文。	四正釋文。	Fourth, the correct explanation of the text.

['ZH_T35_1735_049:0873b29_18']	一品之內多以依喻正者，非唯義類相似，實則外由內變，故令外器全似於內。	一品之內多以依喻正者，非唯義類相似，實則外由內變，故令外器全似於內。	In the chapter, the main is often based on the metaphors, not only because the meanings are similar, but also because the external changes due to the internal, causing the external vessel to completely resemble the internal.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0873c02_10']	是以上云菩薩善根所起，眾生共業所生等，〈華藏品〉中已略開顯。	是以上云菩薩善根所起，眾生共業所生等，〈華藏品〉中已略開顯。	Therefore, it is said that it is produced by the bodhisattvas' wholesome roots and born from the shared karma of sentient beings, and so on. It has already been briefly revealed in the chapter on the Repository of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0873c04_8']	第二洪霔大千喻，此之雲雨即前喻中興雲降雨，正喻出現法門，廣大難知周十方故。	第二洪霔大千喻，此之雲雨即前喻中興雲降雨，正喻出現法門，廣大難知周十方故。	The second is the metaphor of the great rain pouring down on the trichiliocosm. This rain of clouds is the same as the rising of clouds and the falling of rain in the previous metaphor, which directly illustrates the Dharma gate of appearance, which is vast and difficult to know and pervades the ten directions.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0873c05_16']	言心相續力者，若約信受，但是圓機，堅種相續能受深旨。	言心相續力者，若約信受，但是圓機，堅種相續能受深旨。	As for the power of the continuity of the mind, if it is about accepting, it is only the perfect capacity, the continuous seeds of firmness that can accept the profound meaning.

Even up to the tenth ground, they receive the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata like clouds and rain. Therefore, the text says except for great bodhisattvas.

The Dharma clouds and Dharma rain manifest in response to the conditions.

Therefore, it is not within the purview of the two vehicles, and it does not contradict reason. It is only for those with great capacity, and only the lords of the world can know it.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0873c15_13']	第五大雨成敗喻，況佛滅惑成德。	第五大雨成敗喻，況佛滅惑成德。	The fifth metaphor of the great rain causing growth and decay illustrates the Buddha's ability to destroy delusions and perfect virtues.

In the text, it first clarifies, and then Buddha's son, it is like... summarizes and resolves doubts. First accomplishing is due to the power of karma, and the difference in Dharma is due to the differences in capacities, not contradicting the single flavor in the sixth.

This means that the differences between humans, gods, and so forth are all heard by the myriad types. The above says that sentient beings each understand according to their type.

It is said that because its limits cannot be fathomed, it is not measurable; because it is heard or not heard according to the capacities and circumstances of beings, it is not immeasurable. Because it arises from many conditions, it has no master; because it arises from the pure Dharma realm, it is not without a master. Because it is unborn by nature, it cannot be shown; because it skillfully manifests the meaning and principles, it is not without demonstration.

['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a10_15']	今初。	今初。	Now, at the beginning.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a12_2']	所以知佛智遍者，無一眾生不有本覺，與一切佛體無殊故。	所以知佛智遍者，無一眾生不有本覺，與一切佛體無殊故。	The reason for knowing that the Buddha's wisdom is all-pervasive is that there is not a single sentient being who does not have original enlightenment, which is no different from the essence of all buddhas.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a12_17']	以上言潛流，則似佛智遍他眾生；	以上言潛流，則似佛智遍他眾生；	The above statement about the hidden flow seems to imply that the Buddha's wisdom pervades other sentient beings;
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a13_11']	今顯眾生自有，故云遍耳。	今顯眾生自有，故云遍耳。	now it is revealed that sentient beings themselves have it, so it is said to be all-pervasive.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a13_16']	此有三意：	此有三意：	This has three meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a15_9']	一明無一眾生不有，則知無性者非眾生數，謂草木等已過五性之見。	一明無一眾生不有，則知無性者非眾生數，謂草木等已過五性之見。	First, clarifying that there is not a single sentient being who does not have it, it is known that those without buddha-nature are not part of the category of sentient beings, referring to plants and trees, etc., which goes beyond the view of the five natures.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a16_15']	二者眾生在纏之因，已具出纏之果法，故云有如來智慧。	二者眾生在纏之因，已具出纏之果法，故云有如來智慧。	Second, sentient beings' causes within entanglements are already endowed with the dharmas of the fruits of being free from entanglements, thus it is said there is the wisdom of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a17_7']	非但有性，後方當成。	非但有性，後方當成。	It is not merely that there is a nature that will be accomplished later.

['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a19_11']	後學尚謂談有藏無，況聞等有果智，誰當信者？	後學尚謂談有藏無，況聞等有果智，誰當信者？	Later students still say it talks of having a treasury but not having it, let alone hearing of equally having the wisdom of the fruits. Who would believe it?
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a21_3']	三彼因中之果智，即他佛之果智，以圓教宗自他因果無二體故。	三彼因中之果智，即他佛之果智，以圓教宗自他因果無二體故。	Third, the wisdom of the fruits within those causes is the wisdom of the fruits of other Buddhas, because in the perfect teaching's doctrine, one's own and others' causes and fruits are not two separate entities.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a22_2']	不爾，此說眾生有果，何名說佛智耶？	不爾，此說眾生有果，何名說佛智耶？	If it were not so, this teaching of sentient beings having the fruits, how could it be called speaking of the wisdom of the Buddha?

['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a25_4']	今有佛智，那作眾生？	今有佛智，那作眾生？	Now that there is the wisdom of the Buddha, how can it be sentient beings?

['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a28_13']	既離倒則現，明本不無。	既離倒則現，明本不無。	Since it is apart from delusion, it is manifest, clarifying that it was originally not non-existent.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880a29_3']	如貧得珠，非今授與。	如貧得珠，非今授與。	Like a poor person obtaining a pearl, it is not now bestowed.
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880b01_6']	是以《涅槃》恐不修行，故云「言定有者則為執著」；	是以《涅槃》恐不修行，故云「言定有者則為執著」；	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra fears not practicing, so it says those who say it definitely exists are attached;
['ZH_T35_1735_049:0880b02_4']	恐不信有，故云「若言定無則為妄語」。	恐不信有，故云「若言定無則為妄語」。	fearing disbelief in existence, so it says if one says it definitely does not exist, it is a lie.
