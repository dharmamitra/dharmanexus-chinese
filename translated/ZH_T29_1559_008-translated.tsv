['ZH_T29_1559_008:0211c11_2']	此惑與種子等云何相似？	此惑與種子等云何相似？	008	How are these afflictions similar to seeds?
['ZH_T29_1559_008:0211c12_2']	譬如從種子芽葉等生，如此從惑惑業類生。	譬如從種子芽葉等生，如此從惑惑業類生。	008	Just as sprouts, leaves, etc. arise from seeds, so too do afflictions, karma, and their fruits arise from afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1559_008:0211c13_10']	又如池是龍所鎮住處恒不枯涸，如此惑龍鎮住生池相續不斷。	又如池是龍所鎮住處恒不枯涸，如此惑龍鎮住生池相續不斷。	008	Moreover, just as a pond that is inhabited by a dragon is always not dry, so too does the pond of birth inhabited by the dragon of afflictions continue without interruption.

Fine food is the food of sentient beings in the intermediate state, because they eat smells, and the food of gods and sentient beings at the beginning of the eon, because it does not produce waste.
