['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a07_19']	如師所誦，臨終心識，亦復如是，成常過故。	如師所誦，臨終心識，亦復如是，成常過故。	Like the teacher's recitation, the consciousness at the end of life is also like this, because it would be a mistake to make it permanent.
['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a08_17']	不至他世，彼世亦不從餘得，成無因果故。	不至他世，彼世亦不從餘得，成無因果故。	It does not reach the other world, and the other world also does not come from elsewhere, because it is accomplished without cause and effect.

['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a17_14']	無有極微等法，從於此世移至他世。	無有極微等法，從於此世移至他世。	There are no dharmas such as atoms that move from this world to the other world.
['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a18_12']	是故流轉，從於虛妄分別習氣而生。	是故流轉，從於虛妄分別習氣而生。	Therefore, samsara arises from the habitual tendencies of false discrimination.

If there is no craving, then aversion does not arise. If there is no aversion, then there is no karma. If there is no karma, then there is no grasping. If there is no grasping, then one does not create future existence. If there is no future existence, then one is not born. If one is not born, then suffering does not arise in body and mind.
['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a25_18']	如是不集五種因故，即相餘處而果不生，此果解脫，是故斷除斷常等諸惡見也。	如是不集五種因故，即相餘處而果不生，此果解脫，是故斷除斷常等諸惡見也。	In this way, because the five causes are not accumulated, the effect does not arise elsewhere. This effect is liberation. Therefore, one eliminates the evil views of eternalism and annihilationism, etc.
