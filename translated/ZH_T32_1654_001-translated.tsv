['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a17_14']	無有極微等法，從於此世移至他世。	無有極微等法，從於此世移至他世。	001	There are no dharmas such as atoms that move from this world to the other world.

['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a24_1']	若不愚者則無有貪，若無有貪瞋則不生，若無有嗔則無有業，若無有業則無有取，若無有取則不造後有，若無有者而則不生，若不生者即於身心而苦不生。	若不愚者則無有貪，若無有貪瞋則不生，若無有嗔則無有業，若無有業則無有取，若無有取則不造後有，若無有者而則不生，若不生者即於身心而苦不生。	001	If one is not deluded, then there is no craving. If there is no craving, then aversion does not arise. If there is no aversion, then there is no karma. If there is no karma, then there is no grasping. If there is no grasping, then one does not create future existence. If there is no future existence, then one is not born. If one is not born, then suffering does not arise in body and mind.
['ZH_T32_1654_001:0491a25_18']	如是不集五種因故，即相餘處而果不生，此果解脫，是故斷除斷常等諸惡見也。	如是不集五種因故，即相餘處而果不生，此果解脫，是故斷除斷常等諸惡見也。	001	In this way, because the five causes are not accumulated, the effect does not arise elsewhere.
