['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b01_18']	就初序為二：	就初序為二：	001	The initial preface is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b02_19']	初總攬五義以釋名，次「記者」下就總名以別解。	初總攬五義以釋名，次「記者」下就總名以別解。	001	The first is to grasp the five meanings to explain the name, and the next is to explain the general name separately starting with Recorder.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b03_4']	初文又三：	初文又三：	001	The first text is further divided into three parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b03_18']	初釋妙法，次釋蓮華，三釋經。	初釋妙法，次釋蓮華，三釋經。	001	The first is to explain the Wonderful Dharma, the next is to explain the Lotus, and the third is to explain the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b04_3']	初文又二：	初文又二：	001	The first text is further divided into two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b04_9']	先妙、次法。	先妙、次法。	001	The first is wonderful, and the next is Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b05_12']	下文廣釋先法次妙者，從義便故，今既略解且從名便。	下文廣釋先法次妙者，從義便故，今既略解且從名便。	001	The text below extensively explains the Dharma first and the marvelous later because it is convenient for the meaning. Now, in brief, it is explained according to the convenience of the name.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b06_14']	初釋妙者，但舉一不思議，則已簡於可思議也。	初釋妙者，但舉一不思議，則已簡於可思議也。	001	First, in explaining the marvelous, if one simply mentions the inconceivable, then it has already distinguished from the conceivable.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b08_6']	彼止觀為成觀故，乃以相待為可思議麁，唯一絕待為不思議妙。	彼止觀為成觀故，乃以相待為可思議麁，唯一絕待為不思議妙。	001	The cessation and contemplation in the text is for the sake of accomplishing the contemplation. Therefore, the conceivable and coarse is taken as the relative, and only the marvelous and inconceivable is the absolute.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b09_11']	今則不爾，圓中約時待絕俱妙，餘味約部或妙或麁。	今則不爾，圓中約時待絕俱妙，餘味約部或妙或麁。	001	Now, it is not so. In the perfect, the relative and absolute are both marvelous in terms of time. In the other flavors, in terms of the teaching, they may be marvelous or coarse.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b10_15']	若前三教時之與部一向為麁，至法華被開方稱為妙。	若前三教時之與部一向為麁，至法華被開方稱為妙。	001	If the previous three teachings are in terms of time and teaching, they are entirely coarse. Only when the Lotus Sutra is opened is it called marvelous.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b11_11']	止觀相待義似於別，故判為麁。	止觀相待義似於別，故判為麁。	001	The meaning of the relative cessation and contemplation in the text seems to be in the separate teaching, and therefore it is judged to be coarse.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b13_1']	今此妙名兼於本迹，彼文妙觀獨在於圓，雖異而同，細尋可了。	今此妙名兼於本迹，彼文妙觀獨在於圓，雖異而同，細尋可了。	001	Now, this marvelous name includes the original and traces. The marvelous contemplation in the text is only in the perfect. Although different, they are the same. If one carefully seeks, it can be understood.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b13_10']	下文廣釋不俟多云。	下文廣釋不俟多云。	001	The text below extensively explains it, and it is not necessary to say much.

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b16_4']	妙歎於法，法秖是妙，權實之言兼於施等，三義不同，譬中復論故未別出。	妙歎於法，法秖是妙，權實之言兼於施等，三義不同，譬中復論故未別出。	001	Wondrous praise refers to the Dharma, and the Dharma is precisely wondrous. The words provisional and real encompass the four siddhāntas, with three different meanings. Since the parable is discussed again, it has not yet been specifically brought out.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b16_12']	次釋蓮華又為六：	次釋蓮華又為六：	001	Next, the explanation of the lotus flower is also in six parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b16_16']	初總立；	初總立；	001	First, establishing it in general;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b17_2']	次用譬意；	次用譬意；	001	Second, the meaning of using the parable;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b17_12']	三從「一為」下別釋；	三從「一為」下別釋；	001	Third, from one is below, explaining it in detail;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b18_8']	四「是以」下結法譬先後，以明法譬意；	四「是以」下結法譬先後，以明法譬意；	001	Fourth, from therefore below, concluding the sequence of Dharma and parable, in order to clarify the meaning of Dharma and parable;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b19_4']	五「蕩化城」下探取經旨，以顯法譬；	五「蕩化城」下探取經旨，以顯法譬；	001	Fifth, from destroying the provisional city below, exploring the purport of the sūtra, in order to reveal the Dharma and parable;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b20_2']	六「一期」下總結用譬本意，以示結歸。	六「一期」下總結用譬本意，以示結歸。	001	Sixth, from one period below, concluding the original meaning of using the parable, in order to show the conclusion.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b21_4']	初文者，妙法不出權實，故蓮以譬實、華以譬權。	初文者，妙法不出權實，故蓮以譬實、華以譬權。	001	As for the first passage, the wondrous Dharma is not apart from provisional and real, therefore the lotus is used to illustrate the real, and the flower is used to illustrate the provisional.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b22_3']	次意者，「良」者發起之端，何以立華譬法？	次意者，「良」者發起之端，何以立華譬法？	001	As for the second meaning, good is the starting point for bringing it up. Why is the flower used as a parable for the Dharma?
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b22_9']	為難解法故。	為難解法故。	001	It is because the Dharma is difficult to understand.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b23_1']	「假」謂假藉，彰猶顯也。	「假」謂假藉，彰猶顯也。	001	Borrowing means relying on, and to show means to reveal.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b23_14']	若非蓮華無以顯於妙法故也。	若非蓮華無以顯於妙法故也。	001	If it were not for the lotus flower, there would be no way to reveal the wondrous Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b25_10']	譬之所顯曰「況」，具顯本迹十妙十麁，總含因果體宗用三，故云「乃多」。	譬之所顯曰「況」，具顯本迹十妙十麁，總含因果體宗用三，故云「乃多」。	001	The more so refers to what is revealed by the simile, fully revealing the ten wondrous and ten coarse [aspects] of the original and trace [teachings], and comprehensively including the three of essence, purport, and function of cause and effect, thus saying even more.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b26_12']	今此序文未暇廣述，略況本迹以攝多途，擬亦譬也。	今此序文未暇廣述，略況本迹以攝多途，擬亦譬也。	001	The preface text has not yet had time to extensively explain, briefly comparing the original and trace [teachings] to encompass many paths, the similes also refer to this.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b27_20']	所對前後，秖是本迹二門各十四品，前三後三故云「合六」。	所對前後，秖是本迹二門各十四品，前三後三故云「合六」。	001	The corresponding before and after are precisely the fourteen chapters of the two gates of the original and trace [teachings], the first three and the last three, thus saying six in total.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b28_5']	次廣釋中二：	次廣釋中二：	001	Next, the detailed explanation has two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b28_11']	先迹、次本。	先迹、次本。	001	First, the trace [teachings], next, the original [teachings].
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b29_1']	一據經文次第故爾；	一據經文次第故爾；	001	First, it is so according to the sequence of the sutra text;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816b29_12']	二據化儀，必先垂後拂；	二據化儀，必先垂後拂；	001	Second, according to the ritual procedures, it must first be revealed and then removed;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c01_3']	三據機緣，則先淺後深。	三據機緣，則先淺後深。	001	Third, according to the capacities of the audience, it is first shallow and then profound.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c02_3']	若以華譬於迹、蓮譬於本，未可辨其前後。	若以華譬於迹、蓮譬於本，未可辨其前後。	001	If using flowers to illustrate the trace [teachings] and lotus to illustrate the original [teachings], it is not yet possible to discern their sequence.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c02_6']	何者？	何者？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c04_16']	從本垂迹則本前而迹後，由迹顯本則迹前而本後，約機雖爾，約佛終以本居於初，則蓮前而華後非譬次第。	從本垂迹則本前而迹後，由迹顯本則迹前而本後，約機雖爾，約佛終以本居於初，則蓮前而華後非譬次第。	001	If we trace the traces back to the root, then the root is before and the traces are after. If we use the traces to reveal the root, then the traces are before and the root is after. Although this is so according to the capacities of beings, according to the Buddha, the root is ultimately placed at the beginning. Then the lotus is before and the flower is after, not in the order of the analogy.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c07_2']	然望劫初種子皆從化生，等是化生蓮之與華皆可為始，故並順二義，迹中權實取譬蓮華。	然望劫初種子皆從化生，等是化生蓮之與華皆可為始，故並順二義，迹中權實取譬蓮華。	001	However, looking at the seeds from the beginning of the eon, they are all born from transformation. They are all born from transformation. Both the lotus and the flower can be the beginning. Therefore, both meanings are followed. In the traces, the provisional and the real take the lotus as an analogy.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c09_7']	迹亦非實無以施權、非權無以顯實，然終以理實為本而一體權實前後同時，蓮華前後比說可知。	迹亦非實無以施權、非權無以顯實，然終以理實為本而一體權實前後同時，蓮華前後比說可知。	001	The traces are also not real. Without the provisional, there is no way to reveal the real. However, in the end, the true principle is taken as the basis. The provisional and the real in one body are before and after, and at the same time. The before and after of the lotus and flower can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c10_7']	今從事說現蓮為譬，以順譬故先施後開。	今從事說現蓮為譬，以順譬故先施後開。	001	Now, from the perspective of practice, the present lotus is used as an analogy. In accordance with the analogy, the provisional is first established and then revealed.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c11_16']	又先開後廢亦且順喻，據其法體開廢俱時，此據最後開廢而說。	又先開後廢亦且順喻，據其法體開廢俱時，此據最後開廢而說。	001	Moreover, first revealing and then abolishing also follows the analogy. According to the essence of the Dharma, revealing and abolishing are simultaneous. This is said based on the final revealing and abolishing.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c13_1']	若中間迭廢，則唯廢無開非今喻意，具如下說。	若中間迭廢，則唯廢無開非今喻意，具如下說。	001	If they were to be abolished in turn, then there would only be abolition and no opening, which is not the meaning of the present analogy. This will be explained in detail below.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c14_16']	今初云「為蓮故華」者，約時且寄華嚴頓後而說，頓中之別理實教權且置未論。	今初云「為蓮故華」者，約時且寄華嚴頓後而說，頓中之別理實教權且置未論。	001	First, as for for the sake of the lotus, the flower, this is based on the time and provisionally explained after the sudden teaching of the Flower Ornament Sutra. The distinctions within the sudden teaching are actually provisional teachings, which are set aside and not discussed for now.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c16_6']	鹿苑施小、方等般若已為開廢而作方便，如此說者且在於小。	鹿苑施小、方等般若已為開廢而作方便，如此說者且在於小。	001	In the Deer Park, the small vehicle was taught, and in the Vaipulya and Prajñā[pāramitā] sūtras, the small vehicle was already opened and abolished as a skillful means. This kind of explanation is provisionally based on the small vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c18_15']	若約教者，通前四時三教皆權二乘，唯在法華，菩薩處處得入，而今文引且從引小，小難引故，故寄說之。	若約教者，通前四時三教皆權二乘，唯在法華，菩薩處處得入，而今文引且從引小，小難引故，故寄說之。	001	If it is discussed in terms of the teachings, the three teachings of the first four periods are all provisional for the two vehicles. Only in the Lotus Sūtra are the bodhisattvas able to enter. However, the present text provisionally follows the leading of the small vehicle, because the small vehicle is difficult to lead, and therefore it is explained by analogy.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c20_4']	「知第一寂滅」約佛自行，自行即是理實，「以方便力故」正明施權。	「知第一寂滅」約佛自行，自行即是理實，「以方便力故」正明施權。	001	Knowing the foremost quiescent extinction is based on the Buddha's own practice. His own practice is precisely the true principle. Using the power of skillful means clearly explains the bestowal of the provisional teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c22_1']	應云為五比丘說，文中略者為欲即說施權意故，即以下句種種之言兼之。	應云為五比丘說，文中略者為欲即說施權意故，即以下句種種之言兼之。	001	It should be said that he taught the five bhikṣus. The text is abbreviated because it wants to immediately explain the meaning of bestowing the provisional teachings. The following phrase various includes this.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c22_13']	從「雖示」下明施權意也。	從「雖示」下明施權意也。	001	From Although showing below, it clarifies the intention of expounding the expedient.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c23_3']	雖復施權，本為於實。	雖復施權，本為於實。	001	Although expounding the expedient, the fundamental is for the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c24_7']	「種種道」者，即兩教因人別教教道，五時八教故云種種。	「種種道」者，即兩教因人別教教道，五時八教故云種種。	001	Various paths refers to the causes of the two teachings, the teachings of the separate teaching, the five periods and eight teachings, thus called various.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c25_9']	次明開者，指實為權、權掩於實，名方便門閉；	次明開者，指實為權、權掩於實，名方便門閉；	001	Next, clarifying the opening, pointing to the real as expedient, the expedient concealing the real, is called the closing of the expedient gate;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c26_7']	今指權為實、於權見實，名方便門開。	今指權為實、於權見實，名方便門開。	001	Now pointing to the expedient as real, seeing the real within the expedient, is called the opening of the expedient gate.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c27_3']	「示」謂指示，示其見實之處，故云也。	「示」謂指示，示其見實之處，故云也。	001	Showing means pointing out, pointing out the place where one sees the real, thus it is said.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c28_18']	第三「廢」者，「捨是廢之別名」，開已俱實、無權可論，義當於廢，權轉為實所廢體亡。	第三「廢」者，「捨是廢之別名」，開已俱實、無權可論，義當於廢，權轉為實所廢體亡。	001	Third, abandoning means abandoning is a separate name for discarding. After the opening, both are real, with no expedient to discuss, the meaning corresponds to abandoning. The abandoned substance of the expedient is transformed into the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0816c29_15']	若留逗後緣，復屬於施，非此中意。	若留逗後緣，復屬於施，非此中意。	001	If it is left to wait for later conditions, it is also categorized as expounding, not the meaning in this context.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a01_3']	若爾，開廢何別？	若爾，開廢何別？	001	If so, how is the opening different from the abandoning?
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a01_5']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a02_1']	約法乃開時即廢，約喻必義須先開。	約法乃開時即廢，約喻必義須先開。	001	In terms of the Dharma, the opening is immediately abandoned. In terms of the analogy, the meaning must first be opened.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a02_14']	若爾，法喻差違，何成喻法？	若爾，法喻差違，何成喻法？	001	If that is so, then the Dharma and the analogy are contradictory, how can it be a valid analogy?
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a02_16']	答：	答：	001	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a04_12']	據理似與喻有違，據事似先開後廢，如先示方便即是真實，既識實已永不用權。	據理似與喻有違，據事似先開後廢，如先示方便即是真實，既識實已永不用權。	001	From the perspective of principle, it seems to contradict the analogy, but from the perspective of events, it seems to first open and then abolish, like first demonstrating the expedient means which is precisely the true, and once the true is recognized, the provisional is never used again.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a05_10']	若約理者開廢俱時，開時已廢故也。	若約理者開廢俱時，開時已廢故也。	001	If it is from the perspective of principle, then opening and abolishing occur simultaneously, because when opening, it is already abolished.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a06_15']	次「又蓮」下，本中譬者，初句總標，次「從本」下正明垂迹。	次「又蓮」下，本中譬者，初句總標，次「從本」下正明垂迹。	001	Next, under Moreover, the lotus, in the original text, the analogy is first generally indicated, and then under From the root, the manifestation of traces is clarified.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a08_11']	「迹依於本」者，示迹不孤立，即垂迹之意本擬顯本，是故今云迹依於本，迹非究竟。	「迹依於本」者，示迹不孤立，即垂迹之意本擬顯本，是故今云迹依於本，迹非究竟。	001	Traces rely on the root means that the manifestation of traces is not independent, and the intention of manifesting traces is originally intended to reveal the root. Therefore, it is now said that the traces rely on the root, and the traces are not ultimate.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0817a09_4']	「文云」下引證者，初先明本。	「文云」下引證者，初先明本。	001	Under The text says, the evidence is cited. First, the root is clarified.

Because of turning away from the great and transmigrating, they were confused about the principle of quiescence and indulged in the wine of ignorance. Because of losing the mind of great compassion, they were deluded about the wonderful causes and considered birth and death to be vast and distant. The World-Honored One had pity and connected with their small capacities. Since the small was still obscure at the beginning, they still had inverted delusions. Observing their past seeds, he entrusted the wealth of karma to them. Since the wonderful practices returned to the beginning, he manifested auspicious signs to startle them.

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a15_1']	「理絕」等者，既開顯已絕偏圓名，為形華嚴方等般若偏圓對明，往結法華絕待之緣，今寄圓珠而譚絕理。	「理絕」等者，既開顯已絕偏圓名，為形華嚴方等般若偏圓對明，往結法華絕待之緣，今寄圓珠而譚絕理。	001	The principle is severed and so forth. After the revelation, the names of biased and perfect are severed. In order to contrast the biased and perfect of the Flower Ornament Sutra, Vaipulya, and Prajnaparamita, the past conditions for the unconditioned of the Lotus Sutra are concluded. Now, it is entrusted to the perfect pearl to discuss the unconditioned principle.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a15_8']	「極非」等者。	「極非」等者。	001	The ultimate is not and so forth.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a17_3']	然一極至理，非凡小之近、非佛果之遠，託五百由旬，引化城之近，說寶渚之遠。	然一極至理，非凡小之近、非佛果之遠，託五百由旬，引化城之近，說寶渚之遠。	001	However, the ultimate principle is neither near for ordinary people and the small vehicle, nor far for the Buddha's fruition. Relying on five hundred yojanas, it draws the nearness of the illusory city, and speaks of the farness of the treasure island.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a19_4']	「極會」等者，凡譚圓說遠為接近廢偏，若冥真契極事理寂然，化周為事寂，顯實為理寂。	「極會」等者，凡譚圓說遠為接近廢偏，若冥真契極事理寂然，化周為事寂，顯實為理寂。	001	Ultimate assembly and so on. Generally speaking, the perfect teaching is far for the sake of being close and abandoning the biased. If one merges with the truth and reaches the ultimate, the matter and principle are tranquil. When the transformation is complete, it is tranquil as a matter. Revealing the true is tranquil as a principle.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a20_2']	又寄圓珠以顯理，冥其理故為理寂。	又寄圓珠以顯理，冥其理故為理寂。	001	Moreover, it relies on the perfect pearl to manifest the principle. Since it merges with the principle, it is tranquil as a principle.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a20_17']	託寶所為譚事，會其事故為事寂。	託寶所為譚事，會其事故為事寂。	001	Relying on the treasure place to speak of the matter, since it merges with the matter, it is tranquil as a matter.

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a22_7']	寶渚本為廢於化城，化城若廢名化儀畢。	寶渚本為廢於化城，化城若廢名化儀畢。	001	The treasure island is originally for abandoning the illusory city. If the illusory city is abandoned, it is called the completion of the teaching method.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a23_16']	衣珠本譬昔聞實相，實相若顯名契寂理，此明中間已入實者。	衣珠本譬昔聞實相，實相若顯名契寂理，此明中間已入實者。	001	The robe and pearl originally illustrate the realization of the true aspect in the past. If the true aspect is manifested, it is called merging with the tranquil principle. This clarifies those who have already entered the truth in the middle.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a25_10']	「而不寂者」去明退大後流轉五趣，耽障中道微細無明，故失於大志。	「而不寂者」去明退大後流轉五趣，耽障中道微細無明，故失於大志。	001	Those who are not tranquil and so on clarify those who, after regressing from the great vehicle, transmigrate through the five destinies, indulging in the subtle ignorance that obstructs the middle way, and thus lose their great aspiration.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a26_5']	復耽現行麁欲無明忘本所受。	復耽現行麁欲無明忘本所受。	001	They also indulge in the ignorance of coarse desires, forgetting their original vows.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818a27_17']	「迷涅槃道」去明流轉後忻樂小乘，如人迷故謂東為西，則東西俱失。	「迷涅槃道」去明流轉後忻樂小乘，如人迷故謂東為西，則東西俱失。	001	Deluded about the path to nirvana clarifies the later delight in the Lesser Vehicle while transmigrating. It is like a person who is deluded and takes east to be west, then both east and west are lost.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b01_2']	三德涅槃即理而具，謂理為遠、背大取小則大小俱迷，謂大為遠為迷大，謂小為極為迷小。	三德涅槃即理而具，謂理為遠、背大取小則大小俱迷，謂大為遠為迷大，謂小為極為迷小。	001	The three virtues of nirvana are complete in principle, taking principle to be distant, turning one's back on the great and taking the small, then both the great and the small are deluded. Taking the great to be distant is being deluded about the great, taking the small to be ultimate is being deluded about the small.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b02_4']	「聖主」去明今日開顯，先以四味調熟來至法華。	「聖主」去明今日開顯，先以四味調熟來至法華。	001	The Holy Lord clarifies the opening of the secret today, first using the four flavors to ripen and bring them to the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b04_6']	迹序四華六動先表四位六番，至流通中變土地裂表顯實相，實相通被故云「一切」。	迹序四華六動先表四位六番，至流通中變土地裂表顯實相，實相通被故云「一切」。	001	The four auspicious signs and six movements in the preface to the traces first indicate the four stages and six aspects, up to the distribution where the earth changes and splits to reveal the true reality, the true reality universally covers, thus it is said all.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b04_17']	覩瑞聽法故云「見聞」。	覩瑞聽法故云「見聞」。	001	Seeing the auspicious signs and listening to the Dharma is called seeing and hearing.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b06_5']	從「發祕密」去次釋經題，初「妙法」兩字通詮本迹，「蓮華」兩字通譬本迹。	從「發祕密」去次釋經題，初「妙法」兩字通詮本迹，「蓮華」兩字通譬本迹。	001	From revealing the secret below, next explaining the title of the sutra, first the two characters wonderful Dharma generally explain the traces of the origin, the two characters lotus flower generally illustrate the traces of the origin.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b06_17']	今以久本喻蓮，會圓譬華。	今以久本喻蓮，會圓譬華。	001	Now, using the long-standing basis to illustrate the lotus, and the gathering of the perfect to compare the flower.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b07_14']	「發祕密等」者，「發」者開也。	「發祕密等」者，「發」者開也。	001	Unveiling the secret means revealing.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b10_1']	昔祕而不說，故部皆屬麁，昔權實相帶、權實隔異，是故不明權實正軌，本果久成但為迹覆，今但指本名之為顯。	昔祕而不說，故部皆屬麁，昔權實相帶、權實隔異，是故不明權實正軌，本果久成但為迹覆，今但指本名之為顯。	001	In the past, it was kept secret and not spoken, so all the teachings belong to the coarse. In the past, the provisional and the real were mixed, and the provisional and the real were separated from each other, therefore, the correct principle of the provisional and the real was not explained. The fundamental fruit was accomplished long ago, but it was only covered by the traces. Now, it only points to the basis and calls it manifestation.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b10_15']	法是現在，受者計異故須會之。	法是現在，受者計異故須會之。	001	The Dharma is present, but the recipients consider it different, so it needs to be reconciled.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b11_6']	位猶在因，故名為道。	位猶在因，故名為道。	001	The stage is still in the cause, so it is called the Way.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b12_5']	聲為佛事且據佛世，義通滅後故名為經。	聲為佛事且據佛世，義通滅後故名為經。	001	Sound is the Buddha's work, but it is based on the Buddha's time, and the meaning extends to after his extinction, so it is called the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b12_14']	色唯滅後故且置之。	色唯滅後故且置之。	001	Form is only after his extinction, so it is temporarily set aside.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b15_1']	前大師序云「有翻無翻」指第八卷，初則唯在於色，次則遍於六塵，故大師序意一往似局而實通；	前大師序云「有翻無翻」指第八卷，初則唯在於色，次則遍於六塵，故大師序意一往似局而實通；	001	The preface of the Great Master previously said with translation and without translation refers to the eighth fascicle. First, it is only in form, and next, it is found in the six sense objects. Therefore, the meaning of the preface of the Great Master seems narrow at first but is actually broad;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b15_13']	章安序意一往似通而猶局。	章安序意一往似通而猶局。	001	The meaning of the preface of Zhizhe seems broad at first but is still narrow.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b16_15']	「圓詮之初」等者，且從迹說，具存應云本迹詮初。	「圓詮之初」等者，且從迹說，具存應云本迹詮初。	001	The beginning of the perfect explanation and so on, for now following the traces, should fully say the beginning of the explanation of the original and traces.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b18_15']	前大師序不釋序品第一者，雖在題名之下，自屬品之次第，非題中之義，故缺不論。	前大師序不釋序品第一者，雖在題名之下，自屬品之次第，非題中之義，故缺不論。	001	The previous great master's preface does not explain the first chapter, although it is below the title, it is itself part of the sequence of chapters, not the meaning in the title, so it is omitted and not discussed.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b19_14']	故玄文末亦不釋之，至疏文初方乃略解；	故玄文末亦不釋之，至疏文初方乃略解；	001	Therefore, the end of the profound text also does not explain it, and it is only briefly explained at the beginning of the commentary text;
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b20_6']	章安承便，故略論之。	章安承便，故略論之。	001	Zhizhe takes the opportunity to briefly discuss it.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b21_18']	「序類相從」等者，一往亦且釋品所以，若有品之由具在文句，此不合論。	「序類相從」等者，一往亦且釋品所以，若有品之由具在文句，此不合論。	001	The sequence of the chapters is from the same category and so on, for now, also explains the reason for the chapter, if there is a reason for the chapter, it is fully in the text, this should not be discussed.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b23_5']	「眾次」等者，二十八品生起不雜、生起非一，故云「眾次」。	「眾次」等者，二十八品生起不雜、生起非一，故云「眾次」。	001	The sequence of the assembly and so on, the twenty-eight chapters arise without confusion, and the arising is not one, therefore it is said the sequence of the assembly.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b23_16']	於中最初故云「之首」。	於中最初故云「之首」。	001	It is the very first among them, therefore it is said the first.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b23_23']	「第一」可知。	「第一」可知。	001	First can be understood.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b24_21']	「譚記」者恐誤，應云「譚託」，謂託寶所譚理極也。	「譚記」者恐誤，應云「譚託」，謂託寶所譚理極也。	001	Tanji is feared to be a mistake, it should be said Tantuo, which means relying on the treasure place to discuss the ultimate principle.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b25_13']	圓是妙之別名，極是妙法之果。	圓是妙之別名，極是妙法之果。	001	Perfect is a different name for wonderful, and ultimate is the fruit of the wonderful Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b26_18']	今寄果法以歎妙，如經「唯佛能知」，故云「敘名」。	今寄果法以歎妙，如經「唯佛能知」，故云「敘名」。	001	Now, borrowing the Dharma of the fruit to praise the wonderful, as the sutra says only the Buddha can know, therefore it is called narration of the name.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b27_12']	作此「敘」字者，敘謂敘述，申作者之意。	作此「敘」字者，敘謂敘述，申作者之意。	001	As for writing this character narration, narration means to narrate and explain the author's intention.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b29_3']	作此「序」者，序謂庠序，如六瑞等為正說庠序，此非今意，故不書之。	作此「序」者，序謂庠序，如六瑞等為正說庠序，此非今意，故不書之。	001	As for writing this character 序, 序 means orderly, like the six auspicious signs, etc., which are the orderly introduction to the correct teaching. This is not the meaning of the present text, so it is not written.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818b29_15']	「會冥」者，謂得經體也。	「會冥」者，謂得經體也。	001	Uniting with the obscure means attaining the essence of the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c02_6']	通則遍為諸法諸經諸行等體，別則唯在因果所取見於實相方名得體。	通則遍為諸法諸經諸行等體，別則唯在因果所取見於實相方名得體。	001	Generally speaking, it is the essence of all dharmas, all sutras, all practices, etc., specifically it is only in the cause and effect that can be grasped, seeing the true aspect is called attaining the essence.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c02_19']	今置通從別，故云「會冥」。	今置通從別，故云「會冥」。	001	Now, setting aside the general and following the specific, therefore it is said unites with the obscure.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c03_7']	以會冥故名宗家體。	以會冥故名宗家體。	001	Because of uniting with the obscure, it is called the essence of the main point.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c04_13']	聞法繫珠是為圓因，得記示珠名為圓果，故以珠敘宗。	聞法繫珠是為圓因，得記示珠名為圓果，故以珠敘宗。	001	Hearing the Dharma and attaching the pearl is the perfect cause, attaining the prediction and revealing the pearl is called the perfect fruit, therefore using the pearl to narrate the main point.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c07_4']	又若論珠體非繫非示，還約於珠以論繫示，故成體家之宗，化周理顯法華之力，故云「俱寂是敘用」也。	又若論珠體非繫非示，還約於珠以論繫示，故成體家之宗，化周理顯法華之力，故云「俱寂是敘用」也。	001	Moreover, if we discuss the essence of the pearl, it is neither bound nor revealed. We still discuss binding and revealing in terms of the pearl. Therefore, it becomes the teaching of the essence. The power of the Lotus Sutra is fully displayed when the principle is revealed through transformation. Therefore, it is said that both quiescent and active describe the function.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c08_5']	良以權實雙運，故調機入寂乃成於宗家之用。	良以權實雙運，故調機入寂乃成於宗家之用。	001	This is because the expedient and the real operate together. Therefore, harmonizing the capacities and entering quiescence becomes the function of the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c09_1']	四華六動居一經之首，故云敘教。	四華六動居一經之首，故云敘教。	001	The four flowers and six movements are at the beginning of the sutra. Therefore, it is said to describe the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c11_1']	通序別序咸皆敘教，通由通漫，故略通從別，別序具五餘四尚寬，現瑞表報其相最切。	通序別序咸皆敘教，通由通漫，故略通從別，別序具五餘四尚寬，現瑞表報其相最切。	001	Both the general and specific introductions describe the teaching. The general introduction is too general, so we briefly follow the specific. The specific introduction has five parts, and the other four are still broad. The auspicious signs represent the reward, and their appearance is the most urgent.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c12_15']	就六瑞中餘四尚寬，未若四位天華、六番破惑動地，教意在此，故略引之。	就六瑞中餘四尚寬，未若四位天華、六番破惑動地，教意在此，故略引之。	001	Among the six auspicious signs, the other four are still broad, not like the four positions of heavenly flowers and the six stages of breaking through delusions and shaking the earth. The meaning of the teaching is here, so we briefly quote it.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c14_11']	前開方便門引意故爾，本迹但是遠近之異，大師所釋其義已顯，故云「可知」。	前開方便門引意故爾，本迹但是遠近之異，大師所釋其義已顯，故云「可知」。	001	The previous opening of the expedient means and the intention of attraction are like this. The original and traces are just different in distance. The great master's explanation has already made the meaning clear, so it is said to be understandable.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c15_14']	次從「此妙法」去一序是譚玄本，序得下文意，此序不難。	次從「此妙法」去一序是譚玄本，序得下文意，此序不難。	001	Next, from This wonderful Dharma onwards, one preface is about the profound basis. If one understands the meaning of the text below, this preface is not difficult.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c15_19']	於中亦二：	於中亦二：	001	In it, there are also two parts:

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c19_14']	「文云」下引迹證本，約自證邊無法可說。	「文云」下引迹證本，約自證邊無法可說。	001	The text says below quotes the traces to prove the origin, from the perspective of self-realization there is no Dharma that can be spoken.

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c23_10']	「大事」下明說本意，意在佛乘，故舉始終意在佛慧，中間調斥非佛本懷，故云「助顯」。	「大事」下明說本意，意在佛乘，故舉始終意在佛慧，中間調斥非佛本懷，故云「助顯」。	001	The great matter below clarifies the original intention of speaking, the intention is in the Buddha vehicle, therefore it raises the beginning and end, the intention is in the Buddha's wisdom. The middle reprimands and rebukes, which are not the Buddha's original intention, therefore it says to assist in revealing.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0818c23_18']	次「今」下正說。	次「今」下正說。	001	Next, from now below is the correct explanation.

The place of the one true characteristic is called the profound principle, and the people of the seven expedient means are all called beginning practice. Seeing and hearing encompass the present and future, and when the Buddha is present, there is only the benefit of sound.

In the milk, the separate is considered not merging. The single flavor of the curd teaching is entirely not merging. In the raw butter, merging has two meanings.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c02_5']	若以圓斥三及以圓斥藏，即以圓融為融。	若以圓斥三及以圓斥藏，即以圓融為融。	001	If the perfect is used to refute the three, or if the perfect is used to refute the hidden, then the perfect merging is considered merging.

Although it also refutes the great, it is mainly refuting the small, so it is said to make the small roots ashamed of the small and yearn for the great.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c06_6']	熟蘇中云令小根寄融向不融者，通教小乘寄於融通之融而得小果，即指小果名為不融。	熟蘇中云令小根寄融向不融者，通教小乘寄於融通之融而得小果，即指小果名為不融。	001	In the ripe butter, it says to make the small roots entrust the merging to the not merging. The small vehicle of the common teaching entrusts the merging and penetrating merging to attain the small fruit, which refers to the small fruit as not merging.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c08_5']	令大根從不融向於融者，即指通別以為不融，即是令通別菩薩向圓融之融。	令大根從不融向於融者，即指通別以為不融，即是令通別菩薩向圓融之融。	001	To make the large roots follow the not merging towards the merging, it refers to the common and separate as not merging, which is to make the bodhisattvas of the common and separate teachings towards the perfectly merging merging.

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c10_10']	若約教論，方等般若亦有佛乘，何獨華嚴？	若約教論，方等般若亦有佛乘，何獨華嚴？	001	If we discuss it in terms of teachings, the Vaipulya and Prajñāpāramitā also have the Buddha vehicle, so why is it unique to the Huayan?
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c12_12']	今墮苦之言，但據不堪唯一佛乘，故聞別等三教猶免生謗，仍用祕密之力且隱小以說之。	今墮苦之言，但據不堪唯一佛乘，故聞別等三教猶免生謗，仍用祕密之力且隱小以說之。	001	The words falling into suffering only refer to being unable to bear the sole Buddha vehicle, so hearing the three teachings of distinction and so on still avoids giving rise to slander, and still uses the power of the secret to conceal the small and speak of it.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c15_14']	雖曰大機尚隔於別，小根被隱一向不聞，由隱小故不名俱立，是故但立頓大之名，不立一乘獨妙之稱，非佛本懷，良由於此。	雖曰大機尚隔於別，小根被隱一向不聞，由隱小故不名俱立，是故但立頓大之名，不立一乘獨妙之稱，非佛本懷，良由於此。	001	Although it is said that the great capacity is still separated from distinction, the small faculties are concealed and do not hear it at all. Because the small is concealed, it is not called established together, so it is only given the name of sudden greatness, and not called the unique and wonderful one vehicle. This is not the Buddha's original intention, precisely because of this.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c16_13']	華嚴頓大尚非本懷，況復鹿苑唯立不融？	華嚴頓大尚非本懷，況復鹿苑唯立不融？	001	The sudden greatness of the Huayan is still not the original intention, let alone the Deer Park which only establishes the non-fused?
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c18_4']	故三藏教首及以部內麁尚未周，故妙號都絕，方等般若比說可知。	故三藏教首及以部內麁尚未周，故妙號都絕，方等般若比說可知。	001	Therefore, the beginning of the Tripiṭaka teaching and the coarse within the collection are not yet complete, so the name of the wonderful is completely cut off. The Vaipulya and Prajñāpāramitā can be understood by comparison.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c20_7']	次從雖種種至非佛本懷者，次明用四味意，探取法華說彼四味本懷未暢，故歸會法華。	次從雖種種至非佛本懷者，次明用四味意，探取法華說彼四味本懷未暢，故歸會法華。	001	Next, from Although there are various... to not the Buddha's original intention, it next clarifies the meaning of using the four flavors. It explores the fact that the four flavors expounded in the Lotus Sutra have not yet been fully expressed, and therefore it returns to the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c21_8']	所以施設之言通於麁妙，爾前猶用權施設故。	所以施設之言通於麁妙，爾前猶用權施設故。	001	The words to set up are common to both the coarse and the subtle. Before this, it still uses provisional means to set up,
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c24_4']	言「隨他」等三者，此隨他等三有通有別，若歷七重及以四教一一說之，此依諸教通總而說，今別約法華別相而說。	言「隨他」等三者，此隨他等三有通有別，若歷七重及以四教一一說之，此依諸教通總而說，今別約法華別相而說。	001	As for the three phrases following others and so on, these three have both common and specific meanings. If one explains them one by one in terms of the seven layers and the four teachings, this is based on the general and common explanations in the various teachings. Now, it specifically explains them in terms of the specific characteristics of the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0819c26_11']	自法華已前皆曰隨他，故前教中雖並有融，以兼帶故並屬隨他，未堪開顯名不務速，務事速也。	自法華已前皆曰隨他，故前教中雖並有融，以兼帶故並屬隨他，未堪開顯名不務速，務事速也。	001	Before the Lotus Sutra, it is called following others.

In the Vaipulya [Sūtra] one still stays in a grass hut, and in the Prajñā[pāramitā Sūtras] one still has no mind to aspire to [attain], therefore it is only in the Lotus Sūtra that one realizes the past loss. Because in the past one did not know that emptiness is existence, therefore one is refuted by emptiness being existence.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0821a23_16']	次通教理通故名為共，通機如雜色，但真如色變，圓理如珠體，機發如物裹，故通教二乘亡實相體，逐詮小之教墮落二乘，鈍根菩薩義同二乘，復能出假，文略不說。	次通教理通故名為共，通機如雜色，但真如色變，圓理如珠體，機發如物裹，故通教二乘亡實相體，逐詮小之教墮落二乘，鈍根菩薩義同二乘，復能出假，文略不說。	001	Next, the common teaching is so called because the principle is common. The common capacity is like variegated colors, but the true suchness of colors changes. The perfect principle is like the essence of the pearl, and the arising of the capacity is like the wrapping of objects. Therefore, the two vehicles of the common teaching lose the essence of the true aspect, pursue the teaching of the small, fall into the two vehicles, and the dull-faculty bodhisattvas have the same meaning as the two vehicles. They are also able to leave behind [the two vehicles] and enter the true, but the text is brief and does not explain it.

Since emptiness and existence are different, they are therefore refuted.

Next, although the people of the separate teaching are not only named the same, because the middle is different, it is said to be far removed. Therefore, the three teachings are all refuted by the perfect teaching.

The edge is originally the middle. Now, abandoning the middle of the edge, one separately seeks the middle. Therefore, using the moon outside the clouds as a metaphor for the teaching path, using abandoning emptiness to seek emptiness as a metaphor for expedient wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0821b03_3']	若知邊中不異即破此意，彼理有中、此邊無中，則實相正法不遍一切，故不名不盡。	若知邊中不異即破此意，彼理有中、此邊無中，則實相正法不遍一切，故不名不盡。	001	If one knows that the edge and the middle are not different, then this meaning is refuted.

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0821b10_13']	壽量實相遍於三界，前之三教體皆不遍，是故不與〈壽量品〉中雙非義同。	壽量實相遍於三界，前之三教體皆不遍，是故不與〈壽量品〉中雙非義同。	001	The real aspect of the life span pervades the three realms, the substance of the previous three teachings does not all pervade, therefore it is not the same as the meaning of the double negation in the chapter on the life span.

['ZH_T33_1717_001:0821b14_7']	「但不但」等者，若自他相對，但是他實、不但是自實，通教真中有二實故，是故二教並非經體。	「但不但」等者，若自他相對，但是他實、不但是自實，通教真中有二實故，是故二教並非經體。	001	But not but and so on, if self and other are opposed, it is only the reality of others, but not the reality of oneself, because there are two realities in the truth of the Shared Teaching, therefore the two teachings are not the substance of the sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1717_001:0821b16_4']	「出二邊中」等者，說中道故名為自行，云出二邊故名為權，此是判權實意也。	「出二邊中」等者，說中道故名為自行，云出二邊故名為權，此是判權實意也。	001	Emerging from the two extremes and so forth, because it speaks of the middle way it is called self-benefit, saying it emerges from the two extremes is called skillful means. This is the meaning of distinguishing the provisional and the real.

The two characters essence of transforming others below refer to the essence of penetrating understanding. Because of the opening, there is penetration, therefore it is called essence.

The defiled robe is precisely the demonstration of the provisional and real for transforming others in the Lesser Vehicle. The present opening is the same as the essence of the provisional and real of the long-robed elder.

There is no more seeking of the food and clothing of the small vehicle, therefore it says the priceless jewel is in the robe. If it is not different, it is still seeking the fruition of the small vehicle, which is like the emptiness of the small vehicle. The meaning of being in the same body is equivalent to together.
