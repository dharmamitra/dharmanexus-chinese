['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c10_14']	經意總云。	經意總云。	The meaning of the sutra is generally as follows.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c11_13']	若生空理未以無間．解脫二道達遍知故。	若生空理未以無間．解脫二道達遍知故。	If the principle of emptiness of beings has not yet been thoroughly known through the two paths of uninterrupted and liberation,
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c12_5']	不能斷惑成阿羅漢。	不能斷惑成阿羅漢。	One cannot cut off afflictions and become an arhat.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c13_1']	不言一切皆須達知方斷得果。	不言一切皆須達知方斷得果。	It does not say that all must be thoroughly known in order to cut off and attain the fruit.🔽Because of this, the eighth arhat not knowing is also without fault.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c14_2']	由斯第八羅漢不知亦無失矣　外伏難云。	由斯第八羅漢不知亦無失矣　外伏難云。	The opponent's objection is subdued.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c14_16']	何以得知別聲詮總　無性答云。	何以得知別聲詮總　無性答云。	How is it known that specific sounds explain the general? Asvabhāva answers:
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c16_4']	非諸煩惱有各別斷　釋緣色等法別相之智名為各別。	非諸煩惱有各別斷　釋緣色等法別相之智名為各別。	It is not that all afflictions have separate severances. The explanation of the cognition of the specific characteristics of form and other dharmas is called separate.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c16_13']	煩惱既非別相智斷。	煩惱既非別相智斷。	Since afflictions are not eliminated by a wisdom that has distinct characteristics,
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c19_9']	故知經云達遍知者是總相智　問以別詮總其意云何　答顯總是別真實性故　論或取共相無常等行者　此第二釋。	故知經云達遍知者是總相智　問以別詮總其意云何　答顯總是別真實性故　論或取共相無常等行者　此第二釋。	Therefore we know that the sutra's statement that one who penetrates and fully understands refers to a wisdom that has general characteristics. The question is: What is the meaning of using the specific to interpret the general? The answer is: Because the general is the true nature of the specific. The treatise states: Or, the practitioner grasps the common characteristics of impermanence, etc. This is the second explanation.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c20_8']	依俗諦解二乘之人依十六行觀於四諦。	依俗諦解二乘之人依十六行觀於四諦。	Based on conventional truth, the two vehicles rely on the sixteen aspects to contemplate the four truths.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c20_17']	賴耶既在苦諦中收。	賴耶既在苦諦中收。	Since the ālaya is included within the truth of suffering,
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c21_8']	無常等行亦該第八。	無常等行亦該第八。	The aspects of impermanence, etc. also apply to the eighth consciousness.

Answer: According to the delusion regarding a stump, it is divided into shallow and deep. Question: If it is said that setting up an analogy to delusion regarding the principle of emptiness of persons is deep, what is wrong? Answer: The meaning clarifies that the characteristics of self and dharmas arise in dependence on each other, with unequal breadth.
