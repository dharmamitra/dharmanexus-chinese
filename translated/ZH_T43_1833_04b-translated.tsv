['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897b27_12']	由此深細境所攝故　無性牒外引經難云。	由此深細境所攝故　無性牒外引經難云。	04b	Because it is included in the profound and subtle objects. Asvabhāva cites the sūtra to challenge this, saying:
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897b28_16']	如說我不說一法未達未遍知等者　釋外難意云。	如說我不說一法未達未遍知等者　釋外難意云。	04b	As it is said, I do not say that one who has not penetrated and thoroughly known a single dharma can become an arhat, and so on. The meaning of the objection is explained as follows:
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897b29_8']	賴耶深細不為小說。	賴耶深細不為小說。	04b	The ālaya is profound and subtle, not for casual talk.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897b29_17']	即小乘人不見第八。	即小乘人不見第八。	04b	Then the followers of the Lesser Vehicle do not see the eighth consciousness.

Since the commentary says that only after thorough knowledge can one become an arhat,
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c05_4']	羅漢云何不堪聞八。	羅漢云何不堪聞八。	04b	how can an arhat be incapable of hearing about the eighth consciousness?

['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c10_14']	經意總云。	經意總云。	04b	The meaning of the sutra is generally as follows.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c11_13']	若生空理未以無間．解脫二道達遍知故。	若生空理未以無間．解脫二道達遍知故。	04b	If the principle of emptiness of beings has not yet been thoroughly known through the two paths of uninterrupted and liberation,
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c12_5']	不能斷惑成阿羅漢。	不能斷惑成阿羅漢。	04b	One cannot cut off afflictions and become an arhat.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c13_1']	不言一切皆須達知方斷得果。	不言一切皆須達知方斷得果。	04b	It does not say that all must be thoroughly known in order to cut off and attain the fruit.🔽Because of this, the eighth arhat not knowing is also without fault.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c14_2']	由斯第八羅漢不知亦無失矣　外伏難云。	由斯第八羅漢不知亦無失矣　外伏難云。	04b	The opponent's objection is subdued.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c14_16']	何以得知別聲詮總　無性答云。	何以得知別聲詮總　無性答云。	04b	How is it known that specific sounds explain the general? Asvabhāva answers:
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c16_4']	非諸煩惱有各別斷　釋緣色等法別相之智名為各別。	非諸煩惱有各別斷　釋緣色等法別相之智名為各別。	04b	It is not that all afflictions have separate severances. The explanation of the cognition of the specific characteristics of form and other dharmas is called separate.
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c16_13']	煩惱既非別相智斷。	煩惱既非別相智斷。	04b	Since afflictions are not eliminated by a wisdom that has distinct characteristics,
['ZH_T43_1833_04b:0897c19_9']	故知經云達遍知者是總相智　問以別詮總其意云何　答顯總是別真實性故　論或取共相無常等行者　此第二釋。	故知經云達遍知者是總相智　問以別詮總其意云何　答顯總是別真實性故　論或取共相無常等行者　此第二釋。	04b	Therefore we know that the sutra's statement that one who penetrates and fully understands refers to a wisdom that has general characteristics. The question is: What is the meaning of using the specific to interpret the general? The answer is: Because the general is the true nature of the specific. The treatise states: Or, the practitioner grasps the common characteristics of impermanence, etc. This is the second explanation.
