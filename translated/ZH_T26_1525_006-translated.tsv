['ZH_T26_1525_006:0257a03_9']	以菩薩持戒，依持戒故得生善道，雖成就捨心而無具足資生。	以菩薩持戒，依持戒故得生善道，雖成就捨心而無具足資生。	Because bodhisattvas uphold the precepts, based on upholding the precepts they are reborn in good destinies, although they accomplish the mind of giving up they lack complete resources.
['ZH_T26_1525_006:0257a04_12']	若爾，不能作他利益，又復不能成就諸餘一切功德。	若爾，不能作他利益，又復不能成就諸餘一切功德。	If that is so, they are unable to benefit others, and moreover they are unable to accomplish all the remaining merits.

Upholding precepts and giving mind rely on each other and mutually benefit each other. Because upholding precepts can benefit the giving mind, and the giving mind can also benefit upholding precepts.

Because one who upholds precepts is born in good realms, due to lack of resources, they are then impoverished and afflicted by suffering.
['ZH_T26_1525_006:0257a17_7']	雖生善道即名惡道，成就捨心生善道處，於作自利及他利因，是故施能利益持戒。	雖生善道即名惡道，成就捨心生善道處，於作自利及他利因，是故施能利益持戒。	Although born in a good destiny, it is still called an evil destiny. Attaining the mind of equanimity, born in a place of good destiny, in the causes of benefiting oneself and benefiting others, therefore giving can benefit upholding precepts.

Although he widely practices giving, he is bound by the mind that loves objects, and therefore the fruits and rewards are slight and thin.
