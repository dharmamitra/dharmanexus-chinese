The names have already been listed. What are their intrinsic natures?

['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c20_10']	由因教力，有諸愚夫五取蘊中執我我所，此見名為薩迦耶見。	由因教力，有諸愚夫五取蘊中執我我所，此見名為薩迦耶見。	047	Due to the power of teachings, there are ignorant people who grasp at the five appropriated aggregates as self and self-possession. This view is called the view of the transitory collection.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c21_10']	有故名薩，聚謂迦耶，即是和合積聚為義。	有故名薩，聚謂迦耶，即是和合積聚為義。	047	Because of existence, it is called sa. Kāya means collection, which means aggregation.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c22_8']	迦耶即薩，名薩迦耶，即是實有非一為義。	迦耶即薩，名薩迦耶，即是實有非一為義。	047	Kāya is the same as sa, called sa-kāya, which means truly existing and not being one.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c23_16']	此見執我，然我實無，勿無所緣而起此見，故於見境立以有聲。	此見執我，然我實無，勿無所緣而起此見，故於見境立以有聲。	047	The view grasps a self, but a self does not really exist. Do not say that this view arises without an object. Therefore, in the object of the view, the word “existence” is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c24_15']	復恐因斯執有是我，為遮彼執復立身聲。	復恐因斯執有是我，為遮彼執復立身聲。	047	Again, fearing that because of this, one grasps as existing the self that is grasped, in order to block that grasping, the word “body” is again established.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c26_4']	謂執我者於一相續或多相續計有一我，此皆非身，身非一故。	謂執我者於一相續或多相續計有一我，此皆非身，身非一故。	047	That is to say, the one who grasps a self, in a single continuum or in many continuums, calculates that there is a self. All of these are not the body, because the body is not one.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c27_12']	由如是見緣薩迦耶，故說名為薩迦耶見，即是唯緣五取蘊義。	由如是見緣薩迦耶，故說名為薩迦耶見，即是唯緣五取蘊義。	047	Because such a view has as its condition the five aggregates, it is called the view of the five aggregates. This means that it has only the five aggregates as its object.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c27_17']	如契經說：	如契經說：	047	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0605c29_10']	苾芻當知，世間沙門婆羅門等諸有執我等，隨觀見一切，唯於五取蘊起。	苾芻當知，世間沙門婆羅門等諸有執我等，隨觀見一切，唯於五取蘊起。	047	Bhikṣus, you should know that among the śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas of the world, those who grasp a self, etc., and those who observe and see, all arise only in regard to the five aggregates that are grasped.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a03_8']	由此但於我我所見，世尊標別薩迦耶名，勿以我無許智緣無境，或智緣有執我體非無，不爾則應緣有漏見無不建立薩迦耶名。	由此但於我我所見，世尊標別薩迦耶名，勿以我無許智緣無境，或智緣有執我體非無，不爾則應緣有漏見無不建立薩迦耶名。	047	Because of this, the World Honored One specifically labels the view of self and what belongs to self as the view of the five aggregates. Do not say that because the self does not exist, the object of the cognition that grasps a self is nonexistent. Or, the substance of the self that is grasped by cognition does not not exist. If it were not so, then one would not establish the name “view of the five aggregates” in regard to the view that grasps as existent the aggregates that are grasped.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a03_17']	經主此中作如是釋：	經主此中作如是釋：	047	The author of the Śāstra explains this as follows:
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a05_6']	壞故名薩，聚謂迦耶，即是無常和合蘊義，迦耶即薩名薩迦耶。	壞故名薩，聚謂迦耶，即是無常和合蘊義，迦耶即薩名薩迦耶。	047	“Because it is destroyed, it is called ‘sarva.’ ‘Kaya’ means ‘heap,’ which means the meaning of the aggregates of impermanence and combination. ‘Kaya’ is ‘sarva,’ which is called ‘saka-kaya.’
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a06_16']	此薩迦耶即五取蘊，為遮常一想故立此名，要此想為先方執我故。	此薩迦耶即五取蘊，為遮常一想故立此名，要此想為先方執我故。	047	This saka-kaya is the five appropriated aggregates. In order to stop the thought of permanence and oneness, this name is established, because this thought must precede the grasping of self.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a07_6']	若爾，何用標以薩聲？	若爾，何用標以薩聲？	047	If that is so, what is the use of indicating it with the sound ‘sarva’?
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a08_5']	但迦耶聲足遮常故，則應但立迦耶見名。	但迦耶聲足遮常故，則應但立迦耶見名。	047	Only the sound ‘kaya’ is sufficient to stop permanence, so it should only be established as the name ‘kaya-dṛṣṭi.’
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a09_4']	無法是常而可聚集，何用身上標以壞聲？	無法是常而可聚集，何用身上標以壞聲？	047	There is no dharma that is permanent and can be accumulated. What is the use of indicating it with the sound ‘sarva’ on the body?
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a10_12']	即於所執我我所事，執斷執常名邊執見，以妄執取斷常邊故。	即於所執我我所事，執斷執常名邊執見，以妄執取斷常邊故。	047	Grasping at annihilation and grasping at permanence regarding the matter of the self and what belongs to the self is called extreme view, because one falsely grasps at the extreme of annihilation and permanence.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a11_12']	於實有體苦等諦中，起見撥無，名為邪見。	於實有體苦等諦中，起見撥無，名為邪見。	047	In regard to the truths of suffering and so forth that actually exist, to give rise to views that deny their existence is called wrong view.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a13_1']	五種妄見皆顛倒轉，並應名邪，而但撥無名邪見者，以過甚故。	五種妄見皆顛倒轉，並應名邪，而但撥無名邪見者，以過甚故。	047	The five kinds of false views all turn upside down and should all be called wrong, but only the denial of existence is called wrong view, because the fault is too great.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a14_1']	如說臭酥惡執惡等，此唯損減餘增益故。	如說臭酥惡執惡等，此唯損減餘增益故。	047	For example, foul curd, bad grasping, and bad views, etc., are only depreciations, while the others are exaggerations.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a14_11']	於劣謂勝，名為見取。	於劣謂勝，名為見取。	047	To consider that which is inferior to be superior is called the view of holding to that which is inferior as supreme.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a15_8']	有漏名劣，聖所斷故，執劣為勝總名見取。	有漏名劣，聖所斷故，執劣為勝總名見取。	047	That which is contaminated is called inferior, because it is eliminated by the noble ones. To grasp that which is inferior as superior is called the view of holding to that which is inferior as supreme.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a16_7']	理實應立見等取名，略去等言但名見取。	理實應立見等取名，略去等言但名見取。	047	In reality, it should be established as the view of grasping, etc., but the word etc. is omitted, and it is simply called the view of holding to that which is inferior as supreme.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a17_6']	或見勝故但舉見名，以見為初取餘法故。	或見勝故但舉見名，以見為初取餘法故。	047	Or, because the view is superior, it is simply called the view. Because the view is the first to grasp other dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a18_5']	於非因道謂因道見，一切總說名戒禁取。	於非因道謂因道見，一切總說名戒禁取。	047	To consider that which is not a cause or a path to be a cause or a path, all of which are generally called the view of holding to a rule and ritual as supreme.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a19_4']	謂大自在、時、性或餘，實非苦因妄起因執。	謂大自在、時、性或餘，實非苦因妄起因執。	047	For example, Maheśvara, time, nature, or others, which are not actually the cause of suffering, are falsely grasped as the cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a19_9']	道有二種：	道有二種：	047	There are two kinds of paths:
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a20_2']	一增上生道、二決定勝道。	一增上生道、二決定勝道。	047	The path of superior rebirth and the path of decisive victory.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a21_6']	投水火等種種邪行，非生天因，妄執為因，名第一道。	投水火等種種邪行，非生天因，妄執為因，名第一道。	047	Various kinds of wrong practices such as throwing oneself into water or fire, which are not the cause of rebirth in the heavens, are falsely grasped as the cause, called the first path.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a22_12']	唯受持戒禁性士夫智等，非解脫因，妄執為因，名第二道。	唯受持戒禁性士夫智等，非解脫因，妄執為因，名第二道。	047	Only upholding precepts and rituals, the nature of a man, wisdom, etc., which are not the cause of liberation, are falsely grasped as the cause, called the second path.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a23_10']	如前際等或戒禁勝，是故但立戒禁取名。	如前際等或戒禁勝，是故但立戒禁取名。	047	Because they are like the past and so on, or because they are superior to mere precepts and observances, they are therefore called the grasping of mere precepts and observances.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a23_19']	應知五見自體如是。	應知五見自體如是。	047	You should know that the five views have these natures.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a25_10']	若於自在等非因計因，如是戒禁取迷於因義，此見何故非見集斷？	若於自在等非因計因，如是戒禁取迷於因義，此見何故非見集斷？	047	If one regards Īśvara and so on, which are not causes, as causes, then this grasping of mere precepts and observances is deluded about the meaning of causes. Why is this view not eliminated by the path of seeing the truth of origination?
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a25_13']	頌曰：	頌曰：	047	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a26_0']	於大自在等，　　非因妄執因，	於大自在等，　　非因妄執因，	047	Regarding Īśvara and so on, which are not causes, one falsely grasps them as causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a27_13']	從常我倒生，　　故唯見苦斷。	從常我倒生，　　故唯見苦斷。	047	Because they arise from the inverted views of permanence and self, they are only eliminated by seeing suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606a28_2', 'ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b02_1']	論曰：🔽於自在等非因計因，彼必不能觀察深理，但於自在等諸蘊麁果義，妄謂是常一我作者，此為上首，方執為因，是故此執見苦所斷。	論曰： 於自在等非因計因，彼必不能觀察深理，但於自在等諸蘊麁果義，妄謂是常一我作者，此為上首，方執為因，是故此執見苦所斷。	047	Discussion:🔽Regarding Īśvara and so on, which are not causes, one falsely grasps them as causes. They are definitely unable to investigate profound principles, but only falsely regard the coarse fruits of the aggregates of Īśvara and so on as permanent, unitary, and creators. This is the foremost, and one then grasps them as causes. Therefore, this grasping is eliminated by seeing suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b03_8']	謂執我者是有身見，於苦果義妄執為我，故現觀苦我見即除。	謂執我者是有身見，於苦果義妄執為我，故現觀苦我見即除。	047	That is to say, the view of the aggregates as a self is the view of the aggregates as a self. Regarding the meaning of the fruit of suffering, one falsely grasps it as a self, so when one directly realizes suffering, the view of a self is eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b05_17']	無我智生非於後位，若有身見見集等斷，於相續中我見隨故，則無我智應不得生，以見唯法時我見則滅故。	無我智生非於後位，若有身見見集等斷，於相續中我見隨故，則無我智應不得生，以見唯法時我見則滅故。	047	The knowledge of nonself does not arise later, because if the view of a real self were eliminated by seeing the truths of origination, etc., the view of a real self would still be present in the continuity of one who has seen the truths of cessation and path, because the knowledge of nonself would not yet have arisen. This is because when one sees only dharmas, the view of a real self is eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b08_5']	無我智起我見已除，然有身見於自在等相續法中計一我已，次即於彼相續法上起邊執見計度為常。	無我智起我見已除，然有身見於自在等相續法中計一我已，次即於彼相續法上起邊執見計度為常。	047	The knowledge of nonself arises and the view of a real self is eliminated. However, the view of a real self has already conceived of a single self in the continuity of dharmas such as Īśvara, and then next it grasps the extreme view of permanence in those dharmas in continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b09_7']	由此應知於自在等法常我二執，唯見苦所斷。	由此應知於自在等法常我二執，唯見苦所斷。	047	For this reason, you should understand that the two attachments to the permanence and selfhood of dharmas such as Īśvara are eliminated only by seeing the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b09_12', 'ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b10_14']	故有頌言：🔽「未如實見苦，　　便見彼為我；	故有頌言： 「未如實見苦，　　便見彼為我；	047	Therefore a verse says,🔽Before one truly sees suffering, one sees it as a self.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b11_13']	若如實見苦，　　則不見為我。	若如實見苦，　　則不見為我。	047	If one truly sees suffering, one does not see it as a self.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b15_3']	」由此已顯滅邊執見，以無我論宗斷見是正見攝，執有我論者斷見是邊執見，故知二見俱見苦斷，以無常等諸無漏行見苦諦時二見既滅。	」由此已顯滅邊執見，以無我論宗斷見是正見攝，執有我論者斷見是邊執見，故知二見俱見苦斷，以無常等諸無漏行見苦諦時二見既滅。	047	On the basis of this, the extreme view of annihilation at the end of cessation is already revealed, because the theory of nonself includes the correct view of annihilation, while the theory of self includes the extreme view of annihilation. Therefore, we know that the two views are both eliminated by the vision of suffering. When the impure activities of impermanence, etc., see the truth of suffering, the two views are extinguished.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b16_13']	於自在等非因計因，隨二見生亦俱時滅，故說計因執唯見苦所斷。	於自在等非因計因，隨二見生亦俱時滅，故說計因執唯見苦所斷。	047	The view that the cause of things is a self, etc., which is born from the two views, is also extinguished at the same time. Therefore it is said that the view that grasps a cause is eliminated only by the vision of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b17_14']	然於非道計為道中，若違見道強則見道所斷。	然於非道計為道中，若違見道強則見道所斷。	047	However, in the case of the view that a nonpath is a path, if it is strong, it is eliminated by the vision of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b20_6']	豈不如計自在等為因，執苦為因唯許見苦斷非見集斷，如是亦應於非道計道執苦為道，唯許見苦斷非見道斷。	豈不如計自在等為因，執苦為因唯許見苦斷非見集斷，如是亦應於非道計道執苦為道，唯許見苦斷非見道斷。	047	Why is it not like the view that a self, etc., is a cause, and the view that suffering is a cause, which you admit is eliminated only by the vision of suffering and not by the vision of the origination of suffering? In the same way, you should admit that the view that a nonpath is a path and the view that suffering is a path is eliminated only by the vision of suffering and not by the vision of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b21_7']	此難不然，以於苦諦見為無常等非彼對治故。	此難不然，以於苦諦見為無常等非彼對治故。	047	This objection is not reasonable, because the view that the truth of suffering is impermanent, etc., is not the antidote to that view.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b22_9']	謂若有執自在等為因，必先計為無始無終等故。	謂若有執自在等為因，必先計為無始無終等故。	047	If one holds that God, etc., are causes, one must have previously conceived of them as beginningless and endless, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b24_17']	此因執唯見苦斷，以無常等想治常等想故，非見苦諦、無常等時能治非道計為道執，故彼道執非見苦斷。	此因執唯見苦斷，以無常等想治常等想故，非見苦諦、無常等時能治非道計為道執，故彼道執非見苦斷。	047	This cause is only eliminated by the path of vision of suffering, because the idea of impermanence, etc., is the antidote to the idea of permanence, etc. When one sees suffering and impermanence, etc., one is not able to eliminate the grasping of non-path as path, therefore the grasping of path is not eliminated by the path of vision of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b25_16']	由此亦遮見集所斷，由見因等非彼治故。	由此亦遮見集所斷，由見因等非彼治故。	047	This also refutes the view that it is eliminated by the path of vision of the origin, because seeing the cause, etc., is not the antidote to that.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606b28_4']	謂非於集見因等時能治非道計為道執，要於道諦見道等時方能治彼非道道執，故彼道執應見道斷。	謂非於集見因等時能治非道計為道執，要於道諦見道等時方能治彼非道道執，故彼道執應見道斷。	047	That is to say, when one sees the cause, etc., of the origin, one is not able to eliminate the grasping of non-path as path. One is only able to eliminate the grasping of non-path as path when one sees the path, etc., of the truth of the path. Therefore the grasping of path should be eliminated by the path of vision of the truth of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606c01_2']	若爾，如是非道道執，理必應通見集滅斷，謂如邪見撥無真道，後即計此能得清淨。	若爾，如是非道道執，理必應通見集滅斷，謂如邪見撥無真道，後即計此能得清淨。	047	If this is so, then this grasping of non-path as path must be eliminated by the path of vision of the origin and cessation, because it is like wrong views that deny the true path, and then immediately grasp that as being able to attain purity.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606c01_11']	此戒禁取許見道斷。	此戒禁取許見道斷。	047	This grasping of precepts and rituals is admitted to be eliminated by the path of vision of the truth of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606c03_2']	如是邪見撥無集滅，後亦計為能得清淨，彼二戒禁取應見集滅斷。	如是邪見撥無集滅，後亦計為能得清淨，彼二戒禁取應見集滅斷。	047	Thus, if one denies the truths of origination and cessation, and later still believes that they can obtain purity, then the two types of adherence to particular views as supreme should be eliminated by the path of insight into the truths of origination and cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606c06_10']	此難不然，體不成故，謂戒禁取其體有二，一非因計因、二非道計道，若有計彼謗集邪見能得清淨，豈不此見無斷集用則不應生，以都無心信有因故。	此難不然，體不成故，謂戒禁取其體有二，一非因計因、二非道計道，若有計彼謗集邪見能得清淨，豈不此見無斷集用則不應生，以都無心信有因故。	047	This objection is not reasonable, because the substance of the two types of adherence to particular views as supreme is not established. The two types are: 1) taking that which is not a cause to be a cause, and 2) taking that which is not a path to be a path. If one believes that the false view that denies the truth of origination can obtain purity, then this view has no function of eliminating origination and therefore should not arise, because there is no mind that believes in the existence of a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606c08_16']	又苦與集無別物故，自在等蘊亦應被撥，若有計彼謗滅邪見能得清淨，豈不此見無證滅用則不應生。	又苦與集無別物故，自在等蘊亦應被撥，若有計彼謗滅邪見能得清淨，豈不此見無證滅用則不應生。	047	Also, because there is no separate substance of suffering and its cause, the aggregates of self, etc., should also be denied. If one believes that the false view that denies the truth of cessation can obtain purity, then this view has no function of realizing cessation and therefore should not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606c09_14']	如何撥無滅諦見後計滅方便非不唐捐？	如何撥無滅諦見後計滅方便非不唐捐？	047	How can one deny the truth of cessation and still believe that the means of realizing cessation is not useless?
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0606c10_14']	如是不成戒禁取體而言應有，故彼非難。	如是不成戒禁取體而言應有，故彼非難。	047	Thus, the substance of adherence to particular views as supreme is not established, and therefore it is not a real difficulty.

['ZH_T29_1562_047:0610b26_6']	此諸纏愛，一切皆緣修所斷故。	此諸纏愛，一切皆緣修所斷故。	047	All these entanglements and attachments are all based on what is eliminated by cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0610b27_7']	唯修斷者此非定因，見所斷亦緣修所斷法故。	唯修斷者此非定因，見所斷亦緣修所斷法故。	047	What is eliminated only by cultivation is not a definite reason, because what is eliminated by seeing also takes as its object dharmas eliminated by cultivation.

['ZH_T29_1562_047:0610c03_7']	於此經中說無有愛，取緣眾同分無常為境者，貪求異熟相續斷故。	於此經中說無有愛，取緣眾同分無常為境者，貪求異熟相續斷故。	047	In this sūtra, attachment to non-existence takes as its object the impermanence of the homogeneous character of beings, because it greedily seeks the cessation of the continuity of retribution.

['ZH_T29_1562_047:0610c11_19']	等言為顯殺等諸纏，無有愛全、有愛一分，以諸聖者善修空故，善知業果相屬理故。	等言為顯殺等諸纏，無有愛全、有愛一分，以諸聖者善修空故，善知業果相屬理故。	047	The word etc. refers to the entanglements such as killing, etc. The love of nonexistence is completely absent, and the love of existence is partially absent, because the sages are well-cultivated in emptiness, and because they well understand the principle of the connection between karma and its results.
['ZH_T29_1562_047:0610c12_17']	此慢類等我慢惡悔，聖雖未斷而定不行。	此慢類等我慢惡悔，聖雖未斷而定不行。	047	Although the sages have not yet eliminated the pride class, etc., self-conceit, and evil remorse, they definitely do not give rise to them.

['ZH_T29_1562_047:0610c17_5']	謂慢類我慢有身見所增，殺生等纏邪見所增，諸無有愛斷見所增，有愛一分常見所增，不善惡作是疑所增，故聖身中雖有未斷，而由背折皆定不行。	謂慢類我慢有身見所增，殺生等纏邪見所增，諸無有愛斷見所增，有愛一分常見所增，不善惡作是疑所增，故聖身中雖有未斷，而由背折皆定不行。	047	That is, the class of pride, the pride of self, and the view of self are increased by the view of grasping a real self. Killing and so on are increased by wrong views. The various attachments to nonexistence are increased by the view of annihilation. A part of the attachment to existence is increased by the view of permanence. The unwholesome remorse is increased by doubt. Therefore, although there are [afflictions] that have not been eliminated in the body of an arhat, they all definitely do not operate because they are bent and broken.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
