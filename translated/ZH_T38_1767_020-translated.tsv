Hearing what has been heard is only the conventional within which there is seeing and hearing.

Not hearing the hearing means the Dharma body gives rise to the provisional. Not hearing the non-hearing means the Dharma body is still. Hearing the non-hearing means the provisional is subsumed back into the true. Hearing the hearing means the provisional traces are heard and seen.

Nirvana is true quiescence, not hearing the non-hearing means when there is a response, it is not hearing but hearing. Birth and death are confused means not hearing the hearing.
