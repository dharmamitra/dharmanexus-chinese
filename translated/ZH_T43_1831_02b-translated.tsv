['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a11_0']	依於尋伺有染離染立三地別。不依彼種	依於尋伺有染離染立三地別。不依彼種	It establishes the distinction of the three stages based on whether there is defilement or separation from defilement in terms of initial and sustained thought, not based on whether their seeds exist or not.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a12_6']	現起有無等者。	現起有無等者。	As for whether they manifest or not,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a12_14']	瑜伽釋略有三解。	瑜伽釋略有三解。	there are three interpretations in the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a12_17']	有義。	有義。	One interpretation is as follows:
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a13_9']	三地就二前後相應建立。	三地就二前後相應建立。	The three stages are established based on whether they are associated with the two [initial and sustained thought] before and after.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a14_5']	謂欲界地．及初靜慮麁心．心所。	謂欲界地．及初靜慮麁心．心所。	That is, the coarse mind and mental factors of the desire realm and the first meditative absorption
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a14_18']	前後相續可有尋伺共相應故。	前後相續可有尋伺共相應故。	can have initial and sustained thought associated with them before and after,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a15_6']	名有尋有伺地。	名有尋有伺地。	so it is called the stage with initial and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a15_16']	靜慮中間麁心．心所。	靜慮中間麁心．心所。	The coarse mind and mental factors of the intermediate meditative absorption
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a16_5']	前後相續定無有尋。	前後相續定無有尋。	definitely do not have initial thought before and after,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a16_14']	唯可有伺共相應故。	唯可有伺共相應故。	but can only have sustained thought associated with them,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a17_3']	名無尋唯伺地。	名無尋唯伺地。	so it is called the stage without initial thought but with sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a17_17']	第二靜慮以上諸地諸心．心所。	第二靜慮以上諸地諸心．心所。	The minds and mental factors of all stages above the second meditative absorption
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a18_11']	前後相續決定不與尋．伺相應。	前後相續決定不與尋．伺相應。	definitely are not associated with initial and sustained thought before and after,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a18_18']	名無尋無伺地。	名無尋無伺地。	so it is called the stage without initial and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a20_8']	若欲界地及初靜慮．靜慮中間細心．心所不與尋．伺共相應者。	若欲界地及初靜慮．靜慮中間細心．心所不與尋．伺共相應者。	If the subtle mind and mental activities of the realm of desire and the first trance state and the intermediate trance state are not associated with applied thought and sustained thought,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a21_3']	及一切色．不相應行．諸無為法。	及一切色．不相應行．諸無為法。	and if all form, dissociated dharmas, and unconditioned dharmas
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a21_13']	不與尋．伺共相應故。	不與尋．伺共相應故。	are not associated with applied thought and sustained thought,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a22_4']	亦皆說名無尋無伺地。	亦皆說名無尋無伺地。	they are also said to be lands without applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a22_9']	故後論言。	故後論言。	Therefore the later treatise says,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a23_7']	有尋有伺地．無尋唯伺地一向是有心地。	有尋有伺地．無尋唯伺地一向是有心地。	The land with applied thought and sustained thought and the land without applied thought but only with sustained thought are lands that are entirely of the mind.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a24_17']	無心睡眠．無心悶絕．無想定．無想生．滅盡定．及無餘依涅槃界。	無心睡眠．無心悶絕．無想定．無想生．滅盡定．及無餘依涅槃界。	The mindless states of sleep, the mindless state of faint, the samādhi of nonconceptualization, the samādhi of cessation, and nirvāṇa without remainder are all called lands without mind.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a25_16']	並名無心地　有義此三就二離欲分依建立。	並名無心地　有義此三就二離欲分依建立。	There is an interpretation that these three are established on the basis of two kinds of separation from desire.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a26_13']	謂欲界地．及初靜慮諸法．假者。	謂欲界地．及初靜慮諸法．假者。	That is, the dharmas and provisional selves of the stage of the realm of desire and the first trance state
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a27_3']	於尋及伺並未離欲。	於尋及伺並未離欲。	have not yet separated from desire for applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a27_10']	名有尋有伺地。	名有尋有伺地。	They are called the land with applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a28_1', 'ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a28_6']	靜慮中間諸法假者。🔽尋已離欲。	靜慮中間諸法假者。 尋已離欲。	The dharmas and provisional selves of the intermediate trance state🔽have separated from applied thought but
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a28_11']	伺未離欲。	伺未離欲。	have not yet separated from sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a28_18']	名無尋唯伺地。	名無尋唯伺地。	It is called the stage of no-searching and only-contemplation.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645a29_12']	第二靜慮已上諸地諸法．假者。	第二靜慮已上諸地諸法．假者。	The dharmas and provisional persons of all stages above the second meditation,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b01_2']	於尋及伺並已離欲。	於尋及伺並已離欲。	are both free from desire for searching and contemplation.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b01_9']	名無尋無伺地。	名無尋無伺地。	It is called the stage of no-searching and no-contemplation.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b01_18']	若在下地並已離欲。	若在下地並已離欲。	If one is free from desire in the lower stages,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b02_9']	亦得說名無尋無伺地。	亦得說名無尋無伺地。	one can also be said to be in the stage of no-searching and no-contemplation.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b02_17', 'ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b03_8']	故後瑜伽第四言。🔽此中由離尋．伺欲故。	故後瑜伽第四言。 此中由離尋．伺欲故。	Therefore, the fourth [chapter] of the later Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says:
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b03_16']	說名無尋無伺地。	說名無尋無伺地。	Here, it is called the stage of no-searching and no-contemplation because one is free from desire for searching and contemplation.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b04_5']	不由不現行故。	不由不現行故。	It is not because they do not occur.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b04_10']	所以者何。	所以者何。	Why is it so?
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b04_17']	未離欲界欲者。	未離欲界欲者。	Those who have not yet become free from desire for the desire realm,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b05_8']	由教導作意差別故。	由教導作意差別故。	due to the differences in instruction and attention,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b06_5']	於一時間亦有無尋無伺意現行。	於一時間亦有無尋無伺意現行。	at one time also have the occurrence of mind without searching and without contemplation.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b06_13']	已離尋．伺欲者。	已離尋．伺欲者。	Those who have become free from desire for searching and contemplation,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b07_1']	亦有尋．伺現行。	亦有尋．伺現行。	also have the occurrence of searching and contemplation.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b07_15']	如出彼定及生彼地　如實義者。	如出彼定及生彼地　如實義者。	Like emerging from that samādhi and being born in that stage. As for the true meaning,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b08_6']	此三但就界地建立。	此三但就界地建立。	these three are established only according to realms and stages.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b09_3']	謂欲界地．及初靜慮有漏無漏諸法。	謂欲界地．及初靜慮有漏無漏諸法。	That is to say, the defiled and undefiled dharmas of the desire realm, and the first meditation,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b09_17']	於中尋．伺俱可得故名第一地。	於中尋．伺俱可得故名第一地。	Because both applied thought and sustained thought can be obtained in this stage, it is called the first stage.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b10_9']	靜慮中間有漏無漏諸法。	靜慮中間有漏無漏諸法。	The impure and pure dharmas of the intermediate dhyāna,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b11_4']	於中無尋唯有伺故名第二地。	於中無尋唯有伺故名第二地。	because in it there is no applied thought but only sustained thought, is called the second stage.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b12_1']	第二靜慮已上諸地有漏無漏諸法。	第二靜慮已上諸地有漏無漏諸法。	The impure and pure dharmas of the stages above the second dhyāna,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b12_15']	於中尋．伺俱無有故名第三地。	於中尋．伺俱無有故名第三地。	because in them both applied thought and sustained thought are absent, are called the third stage.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b13_3']	故瑜伽第四言。	故瑜伽第四言。	Therefore the fourth chapter of the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b13_17']	此中欲界．及初靜慮若定若生。	此中欲界．及初靜慮若定若生。	In this text, the realm of desire and the first dhyāna, whether samādhi or birth,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b14_4']	名有尋有伺地。	名有尋有伺地。	are called the stage with applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b14_13']	靜慮中間若定若生。	靜慮中間若定若生。	The intermediate dhyāna, whether samādhi or birth,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b15_1']	名無尋唯伺地。	名無尋唯伺地。	is called the stage without applied thought but with sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b15_15']	第二靜慮已上色界．無色界全。	第二靜慮已上色界．無色界全。	The second dhyāna and above, the entire realm of form and the formless realm,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b16_2']	名無尋無伺地。	名無尋無伺地。	are called the stage without applied thought and without sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b16_11']	無漏有為初靜慮定。	無漏有為初靜慮定。	The impure and pure dhyāna of the first dhyāna
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b16_19']	亦名有尋有伺地。	亦名有尋有伺地。	is also called the stage with applied thought and sustained thought,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b17_15']	依尋．伺處法緣真如為境入此定故。	依尋．伺處法緣真如為境入此定故。	because one enters this samādhi by means of the dharmas that are the objects of applied thought and sustained thought, taking true suchness as the object.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b18_6']	不由分別現行故。	不由分別現行故。	It is not because applied thought and sustained thought are active.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b19_7']	餘如前說　若就相應及就離欲建立三地。	餘如前說　若就相應及就離欲建立三地。	The rest is as explained above. If the three stages are established in terms of association and separation from desire,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b19_12']	攝法不盡。	攝法不盡。	then phenomena are not completely included.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b19_17']	亦大雜亂。	亦大雜亂。	It is also greatly mixed up.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b20_7']	雖言有尋有伺等地。	雖言有尋有伺等地。	Although it is said that there are stages with initial and sustained thought, etc.,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b20_12']	唯是有心。	唯是有心。	there is only mind.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b21_3']	此就一門麁相辨地。	此就一門麁相辨地。	This roughly distinguishes the stages from one perspective.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b21_8']	於此門中。	於此門中。	Within this perspective,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b22_5']	唯說第二靜慮已上無尋無伺地中。	唯說第二靜慮已上無尋無伺地中。	only in the stage without initial and sustained thought above the second concentration,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b23_2']	無想定．無想生．滅盡定名無心地。	無想定．無想生．滅盡定名無心地。	the attainments of non-perception, birth in the formless realm, and the attainment of cessation are called the stage without mind.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b23_11']	餘一切位名有心地。	餘一切位名有心地。	All other states are called the stage with mind.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b24_1']	後有四門同異建立。	後有四門同異建立。	The last four perspectives on establishment are the same or different.🔽They will be explained later.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b25_1']	如後當說　雖言此中由離尋．伺欲故。	如後當說　雖言此中由離尋．伺欲故。	Although it is said that in this stage, because of being separated from the desire for initial and sustained thought,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b25_9']	說名無尋無伺地。	說名無尋無伺地。	it is called the stage without initial and sustained thought,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b26_3']	然唯說彼第二靜慮已上諸地。	然唯說彼第二靜慮已上諸地。	yet it only refers to the stages above the second concentration.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b26_13']	必定已離尋．伺欲故。	必定已離尋．伺欲故。	Because they have definitely already separated from the desire for initial and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b27_7']	不言已離尋．伺欲者下地諸法。	不言已離尋．伺欲者下地諸法。	It does not say that the dharmas of the lower stages, which have not yet separated from the desire for initial and sustained thought,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b27_16']	亦得說名無尋無伺。	亦得說名無尋無伺。	can also be called without initial and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b28_3']	若如是者。	若如是者。	If this is so,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b28_17']	未離下地尋．伺欲者上地諸法。	未離下地尋．伺欲者上地諸法。	If one has not yet eliminated desire for the coarse and fine investigation and analysis of a lower stage, then the dharmas of a higher stage
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b29_7']	亦應說名有尋伺等。	亦應說名有尋伺等。	should also be said to have coarse and fine investigation and analysis.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645b29_16']	如是建立成大雜亂。	如是建立成大雜亂。	In this way, the establishment of the three kinds of dharmas would be a great confusion.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c01_16']	是故此三唯就界地上下建立　今觀此意。	是故此三唯就界地上下建立　今觀此意。	Therefore, these three are established only in terms of the higher and lower stages of the realms and stages. Now, observing this intention,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c02_16']	依染．離染非釋有尋有伺無尋唯伺地。	依染．離染非釋有尋有伺無尋唯伺地。	it is not an explanation of the stages with investigation and analysis, without investigation but only with analysis, and without investigation and analysis.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c03_6']	但釋無尋無伺地。	但釋無尋無伺地。	It is only an explanation of the stage without investigation and analysis.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c03_15']	即此論文便非盡理。	即此論文便非盡理。	This treatise would then not be exhaustive.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c04_11']	云何可言依有染無染立三地別。	云何可言依有染無染立三地別。	How can it be said that the three stages are established in dependence on defiled and undefiled?
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c05_8']	身在下界成三地染應名三地。	身在下界成三地染應名三地。	If one in a lower realm accomplishes the defilements of the three stages, one should be called of the three stages.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c06_11']	已隨所離應非彼地故　今應問此第三師解。	已隨所離應非彼地故　今應問此第三師解。	Because one would not be of that stage according to what one has already eliminated. Now, this third master's explanation should be questioned:
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c08_14']	界地何由得成差別　由有地法麁細異故　彼麁細異如何得成　必依有染繫法別故。	界地何由得成差別　由有地法麁細異故　彼麁細異如何得成　必依有染繫法別故。	How are the distinctions of realms and stages accomplished? Because there are differences in coarseness and subtlety of the dharmas of the stages. How are these differences in coarseness and subtlety accomplished? They must be accomplished in dependence on the distinctions of defiled and bound dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c09_7']	無漏離染依此地法亦殊。	無漏離染依此地法亦殊。	The pure, which is free from defilement, also differs in dependence on the dharmas of this stage.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c09_16']	已斷是此有染種類。	已斷是此有染種類。	That which has already been eliminated is of the same kind as this defiled [stage].
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c10_3']	故彼地攝。	故彼地攝。	Therefore, they are included in those realms.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c10_8']	言有染者。	言有染者。	As for the phrase with defilements,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c10_13']	有現行染。	有現行染。	there is the actual activity of defilements.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c11_12']	故身在下雖成三界種子有染不名三地。	故身在下雖成三界種子有染不名三地。	Therefore, even though the body is below and the seeds of the three realms are defiled, it is not called the three realms.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c12_1']	言離染者。	言離染者。	As for the phrase free from defilements,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c12_6']	據生上義。	據生上義。	it is based on the meaning of being born above.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c12_11']	即非前地。	即非前地。	It is not the previous stage.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c13_5']	不言已離此染即非此地故。	不言已離此染即非此地故。	It does not say that being free from these defilements is not this stage.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c13_10']	唯識文正。	唯識文正。	The text of Vijñaptimātratā is correct.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c13_15']	不同瑜伽。	不同瑜伽。	It is different from the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c14_8']	瑜伽但依第二禪以上為論。	瑜伽但依第二禪以上為論。	The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra only relies on the second dhyāna and above for discussion.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c15_1']	如前第三師會　又解。	如前第三師會　又解。	As explained by the third master above. Another explanation:
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c15_8']	此中言有染者。	此中言有染者。	As for the phrase with defilements in this text,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c15_14']	有彼現行染。	有彼現行染。	there is the actual activity of defilements.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c15_18']	離染者。	離染者。	As for free from defilements,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c16_3']	即無漏等。	即無漏等。	it refers to the undefiled, etc.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c16_9']	隨所離染地。	隨所離染地。	According to the stage from which one is free from defilements,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c17_3']	即前有染之地今離故名離染。	即前有染之地今離故名離染。	it is the stage with defilements mentioned above. Now, being free from it is called free from defilements.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c17_15']	隨此有．染離染二種有殊。	隨此有．染離染二種有殊。	According to these two differences - with defilements and free from defilements -
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c18_1']	地界法異。	地界法異。	the dharmas of the realm of form are different.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c18_14', 'ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c19_4']	皆應所應二種皆是彼地所攝。🔽不說有染是彼地。	皆應所應二種皆是彼地所攝。 不說有染是彼地。	They should all be included in the two kinds of stages that correspond to them.🔽It does not say that having defilements is that stage,
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c19_9']	離染即非。	離染即非。	but being free from defilements is not.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c19_14']	故文無妨。	故文無妨。	Therefore, the text is not contradictory.
['ZH_T43_1831_02b:0645c20_1']	不同瑜伽。	不同瑜伽。	It is not the same as the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra.
