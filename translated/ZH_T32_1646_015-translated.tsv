['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b13_15']	若止觀能修心修慧，修心慧故能斷貪及無明，何故定說止能修心能斷貪愛、觀能修慧能斷無明。	若止觀能修心修慧，修心慧故能斷貪及無明，何故定說止能修心能斷貪愛、觀能修慧能斷無明。	If calming and insight can cultivate the mind and wisdom, and by cultivating the mind and wisdom one can eliminate greed and ignorance, why is it definitely said that calming can cultivate the mind and eliminate greed and love, while insight can cultivate wisdom and eliminate ignorance?
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b13_18']	答曰：	答曰：	The answer is:
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b15_9']	散心者諸心相續行色等中，此相續心得止則息，故說止能修心。	散心者諸心相續行色等中，此相續心得止則息，故說止能修心。	The distracted mind is the continuity of various minds operating in form and other [objects]. When this continuity of mind obtains calming, it ceases, and therefore it is said that calming can cultivate the mind.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b17_9']	從息心生智，故說觀能修慧，以生觀已後有所修皆名修慧，初慧名觀、後名為慧。	從息心生智，故說觀能修慧，以生觀已後有所修皆名修慧，初慧名觀、後名為慧。	Because wisdom arises from the mind that has obtained calming, it is said that insight can cultivate wisdom. Because after insight has arisen, all subsequent cultivation is called cultivating wisdom, the initial wisdom is called insight, and the subsequent is called wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b18_6']	若經中說修止斷貪，是說遮斷。	若經中說修止斷貪，是說遮斷。	If the sūtras say that cultivating calming eliminates greed, this refers to the elimination of obstacles.

['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b27_10']	時解脫是五種阿羅漢無漏解脫，不壞解脫是不壞法阿羅漢無漏解脫，何故但說遮斷耶？	時解脫是五種阿羅漢無漏解脫，不壞解脫是不壞法阿羅漢無漏解脫，何故但說遮斷耶？	Timely liberation is the uncontaminated liberation of the five kinds of arhats, and indestructible liberation is the uncontaminated liberation of the arhat of indestructible nature. Why is it said to be only temporary cessation?
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b27_13']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b28_2']	此非無漏解脫。	此非無漏解脫。	This is not uncontaminated liberation.

['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358b29_18']	時解脫名但以上力少時遮結，而未能永斷、後則還發，故非無漏。	時解脫名但以上力少時遮結，而未能永斷、後則還發，故非無漏。	Timely liberation is only temporarily restraining the bonds with superior power for a short time, but it is not yet able to permanently eliminate them, and they will arise again later, so it is not uncontaminated.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c02_1']	又此解脫名時愛解脫，漏盡阿羅漢無所可愛。	又此解脫名時愛解脫，漏盡阿羅漢無所可愛。	Moreover, this liberation is called timely loving liberation, and the arhat who has exhausted the contaminants has nothing to love.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c02_4']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c02_14']	若爾，則無聖所愛戒。	若爾，則無聖所愛戒。	If that is so, then there would be no precepts loved by the sages.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c02_17']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c04_11']	以諸學人漏未盡故我心時發，是故於戒生愛，非阿羅漢我心永滅而生愛也。	以諸學人漏未盡故我心時發，是故於戒生愛，非阿羅漢我心永滅而生愛也。	Because learners have not yet exhausted their defilements, the mind of self clings to them from time to time. Therefore, they give rise to love for the precepts. Arhats have completely extinguished the mind of self and do not give rise to love.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c04_14']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:

['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c07_3']	若失有漏，不應自害，故知時解脫不名有漏。	若失有漏，不應自害，故知時解脫不名有漏。	If it were lost with outflows, he should not have killed himself. Therefore, we know that timely liberation is not called with outflows.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c07_6']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c09_2']	此人退失所用斷結禪定，於此定中六返退失，第七時還得此定，便欲自殺。	此人退失所用斷結禪定，於此定中六返退失，第七時還得此定，便欲自殺。	This person lost the dhyāna concentration that was used to sever the bonds. He lost it six times in this concentration. In the seventh period, he regained this concentration and was about to kill himself.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c10_17']	爾時尋得阿羅漢道，是故魔王謂學人死，繞尸四邊遍求其識，來白佛言：	爾時尋得阿羅漢道，是故魔王謂學人死，繞尸四邊遍求其識，來白佛言：	At that time, he immediately attained the path of arhatship. Therefore, the demon king thought that a learner had died. He circled around the corpse on all sides, searching for its consciousness, and came to tell the Buddha:

['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c14_3']	從貪心得解脫，從恚癡心得解脫。	從貪心得解脫，從恚癡心得解脫。	The mind attains liberation from craving, hatred, and delusion.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c14_15']	又說斷貪喜故心得好解脫。	又說斷貪喜故心得好解脫。	It also says, By cutting off craving and joy, the mind attains good liberation.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c15_7']	又說從欲漏心得解脫。	又說從欲漏心得解脫。	It also says, The mind attains liberation from the defilement of desire.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c16_4']	如是皆應名遮解脫，非實解脫。	如是皆應名遮解脫，非實解脫。	In this way, all should be called temporary liberation, not true liberation.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c16_7']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c17_4']	是中亦說無明斷，故知是畢竟解脫。	是中亦說無明斷，故知是畢竟解脫。	Here it also says that ignorance is cut off, so it is known to be ultimate liberation.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c19_11']	若說斷貪或是遮斷或畢竟斷，若不生真智則是遮斷，隨生真智是畢竟斷，無有用止能畢竟斷貪。	若說斷貪或是遮斷或畢竟斷，若不生真智則是遮斷，隨生真智是畢竟斷，無有用止能畢竟斷貪。	If it is said that cutting off craving is either temporary cessation or ultimate cessation, if true wisdom is not produced, it is temporary cessation, and as true wisdom is produced, it is ultimate cessation. There is no use of stopping to be able to ultimately cut off craving.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c20_17']	若然者，外道亦能畢竟斷貪，而實不然，故知但是遮斷。	若然者，外道亦能畢竟斷貪，而實不然，故知但是遮斷。	If so, non-Buddhists can also ultimately cut off craving, but this is not so in reality. Therefore, it is known to be only temporary cessation.

['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c25_15']	若以散心分別陰界入等，因此得緣滅止，是名以觀修心、依止得解脫。	若以散心分別陰界入等，因此得緣滅止，是名以觀修心、依止得解脫。	If one discriminates the aggregates, realms, and sense bases with a scattered mind, and based on this attains the stillness of the cessation of suffering, this is called cultivating concentration with insight and attaining liberation based on stillness.
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0358c26_13']	若得念處等達分攝心，則俱修止觀。	若得念處等達分攝心，則俱修止觀。	If one attains the mind-contemplation and other penetrations that encompass the mind, then one cultivates both stillness and insight.

['ZH_T32_1646_015:0359a02_14']	現見身業雖念念滅，以修習故有異技能，隨修習久轉轉便易；	現見身業雖念念滅，以修習故有異技能，隨修習久轉轉便易；	It is clearly seen that although bodily actions cease moment by moment, due to cultivation there are different skills, and the longer one cultivates, the easier it becomes;
['ZH_T32_1646_015:0359a03_1']	口業亦爾。	口業亦爾。	The same is true for verbal karma.
