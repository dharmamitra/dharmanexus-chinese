['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b04_10']	大小更互相生故云共生。	大小更互相生故云共生。	Because the large and small mutually give rise to each other, it is said that they arise together.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b08_19']	雙牒大小二生故云生生。	雙牒大小二生故云生生。	It refers to both the large and small two arisings, thus it is said arising of arising.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b09_13']	此大小二生二俱有也不須相生。	此大小二生二俱有也不須相生。	This large and small two arisings both exist, there is no need for each other to arise.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b14_7']	復次如子前有第二破譬。	復次如子前有第二破譬。	Next, like the previous section on the child, the second refutation uses an analogy.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b14_12']	有二論本。	有二論本。	There are two versions of the treatise.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b15_4']	如子前有宋代馮師用之。	如子前有宋代馮師用之。	Like the previous section on the child, it was used by Master Feng of the Song Dynasty.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b16_4']	子是眾生無始已有。	子是眾生無始已有。	The child is something that sentient beings have had since beginningless time.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b16_9']	小生不爾。	小生不爾。	The small arising is not like this.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b17_2']	今明此破有二義。	今明此破有二義。	Now, this refutation has two meanings.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b17_8']	一者如馮師。	一者如馮師。	First, like Master Feng.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b18_2']	子是眾生先來已有故云前有。	子是眾生先來已有故云前有。	The child is something that sentient beings have had from the beginning, so it is called having before.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b18_17']	二者子生子必先有子然後更生子。	二者子生子必先有子然後更生子。	Second, when a child gives birth to a child, it must first have a child and then give birth to another child.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b19_16']	如世間兒生兒必前有兒然後取婦更生兒。	如世間兒生兒必前有兒然後取婦更生兒。	Just as when a son gives birth to a son, he must first have a son and then take a wife to give birth to another son.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b20_10']	汝小生不更生小生故非喻。	汝小生不更生小生故非喻。	Since your small arising does not give rise to another small arising, it is not a suitable analogy.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b20_17']	是父更有父者。	是父更有父者。	If the father has another father,
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b21_5']	前破子喻於小。	前破子喻於小。	The previous refutation used the analogy of the child to refute the small.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b21_12']	今破父喻於大。	今破父喻於大。	Now, the refutation uses the analogy of the father to refute the large.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b22_6']	父更從父大不從大故亦非喻。	父更從父大不從大故亦非喻。	Since the father has another father, the large does not come from the large, so it is also not a suitable analogy.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b22_15']	若有論本如父前有。	若有論本如父前有。	If there is a treatise that is like the father being present before,
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b23_2']	此文亦是也。	此文亦是也。	this text is also like that.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b23_7']	何以知然。	何以知然。	How can this be known?
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b23_18']	彼以子喻小生父喻大生。	彼以子喻小生父喻大生。	They use the son as a metaphor for the small birth and the father as a metaphor for the great birth.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b24_5']	只此子能生子。	只此子能生子。	This son is able to give birth to a son,
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b24_16']	即是父義故云如父先有。	即是父義故云如父先有。	which is precisely the meaning of the father, therefore it is said to be like the father being present before.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b25_8']	外曰定有生可生法有故。	外曰定有生可生法有故。	The opponent says: There definitely is production because there is that which is produced.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b27_10']	一舉可生而證有生。	一舉可生而證有生。	First, by citing that which is produced, they establish the existence of production.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b28_3']	二見內借所破能便謂有所。	二見內借所破能便謂有所。	Second, seeing that the opponent borrows the ability to refute, they think there is something.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b28_9']	故舉所證能。	故舉所證能。	Therefore, they cite that which is established and the ability to establish.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b28_19']	內曰若有生無可生者。	內曰若有生無可生者。	The opponent says: If there is production and no that which is produced,
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b29_4']	內有二破。	內有二破。	The opponent has two refutations.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b29_13']	一有無破二三門破。	一有無破二三門破。	First, the refutation of existence and non-existence, second, the refutation through three approaches.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b29_18']	有無破者。	有無破者。	The refutation of existence and non-existence is as follows.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292b30_7']	外舉所相證有能相。	外舉所相證有能相。	The opponent cites the characterized to establish the existence of the characteristic.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c01_1']	內還捉能相有無以破可相。	內還捉能相有無以破可相。	The opponent takes the characteristic's existence and non-existence to refute the characterized.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c01_10']	若有生相生不孤立。	若有生相生不孤立。	If there is the characteristic of production, production does not stand alone.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c01_19']	必生瓶竟然後名生。	必生瓶竟然後名生。	Only after the pot is definitely born can it be called born.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c02_12']	今既有生瓶則已成不名可生。	今既有生瓶則已成不名可生。	Now that there is the birth of a pot, it is already accomplished and cannot be called something that can be born.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c03_3']	故云若有生無可生。	故云若有生無可生。	Therefore it is said that if there is birth, there is nothing that can be born.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c03_8']	所以然者。	所以然者。	The reason for this is as follows.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c03_16']	夫未生名為可生。	夫未生名為可生。	That which has not yet been born is called something that can be born.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c04_1']	今有生相。	今有生相。	Now there is the characteristic of birth.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c04_11']	瓶則已生不名可生也。	瓶則已生不名可生也。	The pot is already born and cannot be called something that can be born.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c04_16']	無門破者。	無門破者。	The refutation through the absence of a gate means:
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c05_6']	已有生相尚無有可生。	已有生相尚無有可生。	Even with the characteristic of birth, there is still nothing that can be born.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c05_16']	況無生相而有可生也。	況無生相而有可生也。	How much less so when there is no characteristic of birth and yet something that can be born!
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c06_11']	復次自他共亦如是第二三門破。	復次自他共亦如是第二三門破。	Furthermore, the self, other, and common are also like this. The second and third gates refute.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c07_1']	此三門通破體相。	此三門通破體相。	These three gates refute the essence and characteristics in common.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c07_10']	生相自生破不展轉。	生相自生破不展轉。	The characteristic of birth itself being born refutes the non-sequential.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c07_19']	若從他生破於展轉。	若從他生破於展轉。	If it arises from another, it refutes the sequential.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c08_6']	共生合破二家。	共生合破二家。	The common birth combines the refutations of both parties.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c08_17']	法體自生破即法有相義。	法體自生破即法有相義。	The essence of dharmas itself being born refutes the meaning of the characteristic of existence in the dharma.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c09_8']	如離法體外無別有相。	如離法體外無別有相。	Just as outside of the essence of the dharma, there is no separate characteristic.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c10_1']	即以法起為生名為自生。	即以法起為生名為自生。	Using the arising of the dharma as birth is called self-birth.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c11_1']	法從他生破異法體外別有生相能生法體。	法從他生破異法體外別有生相能生法體。	The dharma arising from another refutes the separate characteristic of birth outside of the essence of the dharma that can give rise to the essence of the dharma.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c11_9']	共生者合破二義。	共生者合破二義。	The two meanings of co-arising are combination and destruction.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c12_9']	外曰定有生可生共成故第三俱立生可生也。	外曰定有生可生共成故第三俱立生可生也。	The opponent says: There is definitely arising that can be produced, because they are established together. The third establishes both arising and what can be produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c12_18']	若有能生則有可生。	若有能生則有可生。	If there is that which can produce, then there is that which can be produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c13_8']	若有可生則有能生。	若有可生則有能生。	If there is that which can be produced, then there is that which can produce.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c13_15']	一時相待而有。	一時相待而有。	They exist in relation to each other at the same time.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c14_1']	所以一時者。	所以一時者。	The reason it is said to be at the same time is
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c14_10']	內外同明體相必俱。	內外同明體相必俱。	because the inner and outer [teachings] both clarify that substance and characteristics must be simultaneous.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c15_2']	如法在未來則相在未來。	如法在未來則相在未來。	If dharmas are in the future, then their characteristics are in the future.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c15_12']	是故一時。	是故一時。	Therefore, it is at the same time.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c16_1']	內曰生可生不能生。	內曰生可生不能生。	The inner [teaching] says: Arising and what can be produced cannot produce.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c16_6']	內有二破。	內有二破。	There are two refutations in the inner [teaching].
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c16_15']	一縱待破二奪待破。	一縱待破二奪待破。	The first is a refutation of concession and dependence, and the second is a refutation of negation and dependence.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c16_20']	縱待破者。	縱待破者。	The refutation of concession is
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c17_10']	縱能所互待則能所無定。	縱能所互待則能所無定。	that if the able and the unable are mutually dependent, then the able and the unable are indeterminate.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c17_17']	無定則無能所。	無定則無能所。	If they are indeterminate, then there is neither that which can produce nor that which can be produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c18_8']	同中論若法有待成偈。	同中論若法有待成偈。	It is the same as the Madhyamaka-śāstra's verse If dharmas are established through dependence.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c19_1']	今文云生可生不能生者。	今文云生可生不能生者。	The present text says Arising and what can be produced cannot produce.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c19_8']	由可生有能生。	由可生有能生。	Because what can be produced has that which can produce,
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c19_15']	則能生成可生。	則能生成可生。	then that which can produce can produce what can be produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c20_2']	故能生非能生。	故能生非能生。	Therefore, that which can produce is not able to produce.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c20_11', 'ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c21_1']	故云生可生不能生。🔽既能成所則非復能。	故云生可生不能生。 既能成所則非復能。	Therefore it is said that the produced cannot produce the producer.🔽Since the produced can be the producer, it is no longer the produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c21_10']	所則成能便非復所。	所則成能便非復所。	If the produced becomes the producer, it is no longer the produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c21_16']	故無能無所。	故無能無所。	Therefore there is no producer and no produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c22_1']	以何相待。	以何相待。	What can be mutually dependent?
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c22_16']	復次有無相待不然者第二奪待破。	復次有無相待不然者第二奪待破。	Next, the second refutation of mutual dependence is to deny it.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c23_4']	能所是有無義。	能所是有無義。	The meaning of existence and non-existence is that of producer and produced.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c23_9']	不得論待。	不得論待。	It cannot be discussed in terms of mutual dependence.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c24_6']	如長短俱有可得待長說短待短說長。	如長短俱有可得待長說短待短說長。	Like long and short, both can be obtained. Long can be said in dependence on short, and short can be said in dependence on long.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c24_16']	今能生是有可生是無。	今能生是有可生是無。	Now the producer exists, and the produced does not exist.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c26_11']	故能生是有。	故能生是有。	Therefore the producer exists.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c27_4']	故有無不得待。	故有無不得待。	Therefore existence and non-existence cannot be mutually dependent.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c27_15']	問今待有說無待無說有。	問今待有說無待無說有。	Question: Now existence is said in dependence on non-existence, and non-existence is said in dependence on existence.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0292c29_19']	此乃是捉有無破能所相待。	此乃是捉有無破能所相待。	This is grasping existence and non-existence to break the characteristics of subject and object in mutual dependence.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a02_1']	外云有能則有所有所則有能故能所一時相待。	外云有能則有所有所則有能故能所一時相待。	The opponent says: If there is a subject, then there is an object. If there is an object, then there is a subject. Therefore, subject and object depend on each other simultaneously.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a02_12']	今明能有所無云何得待。	今明能有所無云何得待。	Now, it is explained that if the subject does not exist, how can it be dependent?

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a04_15']	一者有無二體各成不須相待。	一者有無二體各成不須相待。	First, the two entities of existence and non-existence are each established and do not need to depend on each other.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a05_5']	若二體不成則無有無。	若二體不成則無有無。	If the two entities are not established, then there is neither existence nor non-existence.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a06_2']	二者有無為待成為成待。	二者有無為待成為成待。	Second, existence and non-existence are established through dependence, and the establishment depends on each other.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a06_11']	若有無成竟而更待。	若有無成竟而更待。	If existence and non-existence are already established and then depend on each other again,
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a07_1']	則有重有重無之過。	則有重有重無之過。	then there is the fault of double existence and double non-existence.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a07_13']	若待成者則知未待時未成。	若待成者則知未待時未成。	If they are established through dependence, then it is known that when not yet dependent, they are not yet established.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a11_19']	故知生可生相待。	故知生可生相待。	Therefore we know that birth and the born can be mutually dependent.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a12_11']	何故前云生可生不得互待。	何故前云生可生不得互待。	Why did you previously say that birth and the born cannot be mutually dependent?

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a13_14']	內曰若二生何以無三。	內曰若二生何以無三。	The proponent of the inner teaching says: If there are two births, why are there not three?

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a15_10']	若爾者離生可生外應有第三法成。	若爾者離生可生外應有第三法成。	If that is so, then apart from birth and the born, there should be a third dharma that is established.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a16_3']	而離生可生外無第三法。	而離生可生外無第三法。	But apart from birth and the born, there is no third dharma.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a16_14']	如生相是能生瓶是可生。	如生相是能生瓶是可生。	For example, the characteristic of birth is that which gives rise to, and the vase is that which is born.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a18_2']	汝何得言生可生故諸法成耶。	汝何得言生可生故諸法成耶。	How can you say that because of birth and the born, all dharmas are established?
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a18_18']	若言生可生相待還生可生二法成者。	若言生可生相待還生可生二法成者。	If you say that birth and the born are mutually dependent and give rise to the two dharmas of birth and the born being established,

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a21_2']	答父母同是能生則屬生相子屬所相。	答父母同是能生則屬生相子屬所相。	Answer: Parents are both able to give birth, so they belong to the characteristic of arising. The child belongs to the characterized.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a21_8']	故唯有二也。	故唯有二也。	Therefore, there are only two.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a24_7']	今明無滅門明不生不滅義也。	今明無滅門明不生不滅義也。	Now, it clarifies the gate of no cessation, illuminating the meaning of neither arising nor ceasing.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a24_11']	救意云。	救意云。	The intention of the rescue is as follows:
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a25_1']	若無果生寧有因滅。	若無果生寧有因滅。	If there is no arising of effects, how can there be the cessation of causes?
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a25_10']	既有因滅即有果生。	既有因滅即有果生。	Since there is the cessation of causes, there is the arising of effects.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a26_8']	答六道三乘本不生今不滅。	答六道三乘本不生今不滅。	Answer: The six destinies and three vehicles were originally unborn and now unceased.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a27_1']	即顯不生死不涅槃等義。	即顯不生死不涅槃等義。	This reveals the meaning of neither birth-and-death nor nirvana, etc.
['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a27_10']	內曰因壞故生亦滅。	內曰因壞故生亦滅。	The respondent says: Because the cause is destroyed, arising also ceases.

['ZH_T42_1827_03a:0293a28_19']	以外舉壞證生故內就壞撿生。	以外舉壞證生故內就壞撿生。	Because the external example of destruction proves arising, internally, arising is examined through destruction.
