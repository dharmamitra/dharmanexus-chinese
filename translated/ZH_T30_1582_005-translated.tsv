One should not even give rise to a slight evil thought, let alone strike or scold. Therefore, the bodhisattva destroys the notion of permanence and cultivates the notion of impermanence. By being able to cultivate the notion of impermanence, one accomplishes the mind of patience. Because one accomplishes the mind of patience, one cultivates the path to enlightenment, and ultimately attains supreme perfect enlightenment.

['ZH_T30_1582_005:0985c25_5']	菩薩諦觀，有諸外道說我是常。	菩薩諦觀，有諸外道說我是常。	Bodhisattvas contemplate carefully, there are non-Buddhists who say that the self is permanent.
['ZH_T30_1582_005:0985c25_15']	我若常者，眾生無我。	我若常者，眾生無我。	If the self is permanent, then sentient beings have no self.
['ZH_T30_1582_005:0985c25_19']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1582_005:0985c27_1']	眾生者即是五陰，五陰無常，若無我者何有我所？	眾生者即是五陰，五陰無常，若無我者何有我所？	Sentient beings are precisely the five aggregates, and the five aggregates are impermanent. If there is no self, how can there be possession?

['ZH_T30_1582_005:0986a01_9']	若我於彼有瞋心者，云何得名有我有我所？	若我於彼有瞋心者，云何得名有我有我所？	If I have an angry mind towards them, how can I be said to have a self and possession?
['ZH_T30_1582_005:0986a02_8']	我若增長瞋恚心者，不能度脫一切眾生。	我若增長瞋恚心者，不能度脫一切眾生。	If I increase my angry mind, I will not be able to liberate all sentient beings.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:

Living at home, I worked in the fields, planting and reaping, enduring various hardships. I associated with the ruler, buying and selling in the market, enduring much suffering.
