['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a04_11']	或同一果是和合義，雖根境識未必俱生，而觸果同，故名和合。	或同一果是和合義，雖根境識未必俱生，而觸果同，故名和合。	Or the meaning of union is that they have the same effect. Although the faculties, objects, and consciousness may not necessarily arise together, because the effect of contact is the same, it is called union.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a05_1']	觸體別有，大地中已成。	觸體別有，大地中已成。	The substance of contact is a separate dharma, which has already been established among the ten universal activities.

['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a19_3']	第六意觸說名增語，增語謂名，名是意觸所緣長境，故偏說此名增語觸。	第六意觸說名增語，增語謂名，名是意觸所緣長境，故偏說此名增語觸。	The sixth contact of mind is called having discursive thought because discursive thought is name, and name is the extended object of mental contact, so it is unilaterally called contact with discursive thought.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a20_2']	意識通用名義為境，五不緣名故說為長。	意識通用名義為境，五不緣名故說為長。	Because mental consciousness generally takes names and meanings as its objects, while the first five do not take names as objects, it is said to be extended.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a21_11']	如說眼識，但能了青不了是青，意識了青亦了是青，乃至廣說。	如說眼識，但能了青不了是青，意識了青亦了是青，乃至廣說。	It is said that eye consciousness only cognizes blue but does not cognize it is blue, while mental consciousness cognizes blue and also cognizes it is blue, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a22_12']	故有對觸名從所依境，就所長境立增語觸名。	故有對觸名從所依境，就所長境立增語觸名。	Therefore, the name resistant contact comes from the support and object, while the name contact with discursive thought is established based on the extended object.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a23_11']	有說意識名為增語，於發語中為增上故。	有說意識名為增語，於發語中為增上故。	Some say that mental consciousness is called “having conceptual proliferation” because it is dominant in the production of speech.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a25_8']	有言意識語為增上方於境轉，五識不然，是故意識獨名增語，與此相應名增語觸。	有言意識語為增上方於境轉，五識不然，是故意識獨名增語，與此相應名增語觸。	Some say that mental consciousness is called “having conceptual proliferation” because it turns toward an object only when it is dominant in speech, but the five consciousnesses are not like this. Therefore mental consciousness alone is called “having conceptual proliferation,” and that which is associated with it is called “contact having conceptual proliferation.”
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845a26_9']	故有對觸名從所依境，就相應主立增語觸名。	故有對觸名從所依境，就相應主立增語觸名。	Therefore contact associated with resistance is named according to its support and object, while contact having conceptual proliferation is named according to its association with the dominant factor.

These three should be understood as pure, defiled, and the rest of contact associated with them.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845b04_6']	餘謂無漏及染污餘，即有漏善、無覆無記。	餘謂無漏及染污餘，即有漏善、無覆無記。	The rest refers to the pure and the rest of the defiled, that is, contaminated good and nondefiled and non-defined.
['ZH_T29_1563_015:0845b05_14']	染污觸中一分數起，依彼復立愛、恚二觸，愛恚隨眠共相應故。	染污觸中一分數起，依彼復立愛、恚二觸，愛恚隨眠共相應故。	A part of the defiled contact occurs frequently, and on the basis of that, the two contacts of love and hatred are established, because the propensities of love and hatred are associated with it.
