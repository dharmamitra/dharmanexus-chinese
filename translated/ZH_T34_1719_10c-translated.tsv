['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350b24_11']	初文者，慈恩、安國並令移之於〈勸發〉後，若在此中有八相違、十不可也。	初文者，慈恩、安國並令移之於〈勸發〉後，若在此中有八相違、十不可也。	10c	In the first part, Ci'en and An Guo both order it to be moved after the chapter on Encouragement, if it is here, there are eight contradictions and ten impossibilities.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350b28_2']	余雖管見，頗有稟承，每於聽筵忝蒙慈訓，垂示救旨深有所憑，近見秀公《法華圓鏡》，廣立難勢不越先規，今攢舊聞兼資後見，總別救之亦八不可。	余雖管見，頗有稟承，每於聽筵忝蒙慈訓，垂示救旨深有所憑，近見秀公《法華圓鏡》，廣立難勢不越先規，今攢舊聞兼資後見，總別救之亦八不可。	10c	Although I have a narrow view, I have mostly received instruction, and every time in the lecture hall I am honored to have received the compassionate instruction, showing the meaning of salvation, deeply relying on something, recently seeing Master Xiu's Lotus Flower Round Mirror, extensively establishing difficult positions, not going beyond the previous plan, now gathering old teachings and supplementing later views, the general and specific refutations are also eight impossibilities.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c01_2']	初總救者，〈出塔〉已後凡述多寶，皆云「塔中」不云「見佛」，若移在後無出塔處，一不可也。	初總救者，〈出塔〉已後凡述多寶，皆云「塔中」不云「見佛」，若移在後無出塔處，一不可也。	10c	The first general refutation is that after the chapter on Leaving the Stupa, whenever it mentions Many Treasures, it says in the stupa and not seeing the Buddha. If it is moved to the end, there is no place to leave the stupa, which is the first impossibility.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c02_16']	分身散後凡有所述，唯論佛塔不涉分身，若移在後佛無散處，二不可也。	分身散後凡有所述，唯論佛塔不涉分身，若移在後佛無散處，二不可也。	10c	After the Buddha's body was scattered, whatever was said only discussed the Buddha's stūpa and did not involve the scattered body. If it were moved to the end, the Buddha would have no place to scatter. The second is impossible.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c04_10']	〈囑累〉文中佛散土穢，已下經文言不涉淨，若移在後無復穢處，三不可也。	〈囑累〉文中佛散土穢，已下經文言不涉淨，若移在後無復穢處，三不可也。	10c	In the text of the entrustment chapter, the Buddha scattered the defiled earth. Below this, the text does not mention purity. If it were moved to the end, there would be no defiled place again. The third is impossible.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c06_6', 'ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c08_1']	會本居地因塔升空，佛散出塔後文在地，若移在後無還地處，四不可也。🔽〈囑累品後〉經既未盡，但述眾喜不云「而去」，若移在後須加「而去」，五不可也。	會本居地因塔升空，佛散出塔後文在地，若移在後無還地處，四不可也。 〈囑累品後〉經既未盡，但述眾喜不云「而去」，若移在後須加「而去」，五不可也。	10c	The original assembly was on the ground, and the stūpa rose into the sky. After the Buddha scattered outside the stūpa, the text is on the ground. If it were moved to the end, there would be no place to return to the ground. The fourth is impossible.🔽After the chapter on entrustment, the sūtra is not yet finished. It only describes the joy of the assembly and does not say they left. If it were moved to the end, they left would have to be added. The fifth is impossible.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c09_16']	〈勸發品〉後無復餘文，經既已終則云「而去」，若移在後須除而去，六不可也。	〈勸發品〉後無復餘文，經既已終則云「而去」，若移在後須除而去，六不可也。	10c	After the chapter on exhortation, there is no more text. Since the sūtra is already finished, it says they left. If it were moved to the end, they left would have to be removed. The sixth is impossible.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c11_10']	本迹二門佛事既畢，須有所付，是有囑累，若移在後法無所歸，七不可也。	本迹二門佛事既畢，須有所付，是有囑累，若移在後法無所歸，七不可也。	10c	The two chapters on the original and traces, the Buddha's work having been completed, must have something to entrust, so there is the entrustment. If it is moved to the end, the Dharma has no place to return, the seventh impossibility.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c13_6']	囑累已後明乘乘人，弘經本事事須囑累，若移在後師弟參雜，八不可也。	囑累已後明乘乘人，弘經本事事須囑累，若移在後師弟參雜，八不可也。	10c	After the entrustment, it clarifies the vehicle and the person riding the vehicle. The main purpose of promoting the sutra requires entrustment. If it is moved to the end, the teacher and disciple will be mixed up, the eighth impossibility.

['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c16_2']	救曰：	救曰：	10c	The refutation says:
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c17_5']	《正》、《妙》二本譯人既異，所見各別，若令盡同此不可也。	《正》、《妙》二本譯人既異，所見各別，若令盡同此不可也。	10c	The two versions of the Lotus Sutra, the Correct and the Wonderful, have different translators, and their views are different. If they are all required to be the same, this is impossible.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c17_22']	言《添品》者，準南山《內典錄》云：	言《添品》者，準南山《內典錄》云：	10c	As for the Lotus Sutra with Additional Chapters, based on the Record of Buddhist Scriptures by Nanshan, it says:
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c20_15']	「崛多擅移〈囑累〉著後」，崛多既其擅改，法護未可為憑，《正》本既其居先，《添品》不名擅改，南山既斥添品，義當二本俱非。	「崛多擅移〈囑累〉著後」，崛多既其擅改，法護未可為憑，《正》本既其居先，《添品》不名擅改，南山既斥添品，義當二本俱非。	10c	Regarding Yijing's unauthorized addition of the entrustment chapter at the end, since Yijing has made unauthorized changes, Fahu's version cannot be relied upon. Since the correct version precedes, the added chapter version cannot be called unauthorized. Since Nanshan criticizes the added chapter version, it means that both versions are not acceptable.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c20_18']	何者？	何者？	10c	Why is this?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c22_2']	羅什生雖龜茲，遍遊五竺，豈獨不見梵本《法華》？	羅什生雖龜茲，遍遊五竺，豈獨不見梵本《法華》？	10c	Although Kumārajīva was born in Kucha, he traveled all over the five regions of India. How could he have not seen the Sanskrit version of the Lotus Sutra?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c22_16']	久居長安，豈不曾見法護所譯？	久居長安，豈不曾見法護所譯？	10c	He lived in Chang'an for a long time. How could he not have seen the translation by Fahu?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c23_12']	而再譯不用者，當知法護非堪指南；	而再譯不用者，當知法護非堪指南；	10c	Yet he did not use the second translation. This means that Fahu's version is not suitable for guidance.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c25_16']	若堪指南，何不文義咸依《正》本，若嫌後譯文義澆薄，則隋朝所譯彌薄於前，今依什譯理可準憑。	若堪指南，何不文義咸依《正》本，若嫌後譯文義澆薄，則隋朝所譯彌薄於前，今依什譯理可準憑。	10c	If it was suitable for guidance, why did he not rely on the correct version for both the text and meaning? If he disliked the diluted text and meaning of the later translation, then the Sui Dynasty's translation would be even more diluted than the previous one. Now relying on Kumārajīva's translation is reasonable and reliable.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c26_3']	故叡公云：	故叡公云：	10c	Therefore, Master Rui said:
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c27_13']	「梵音錯者正之以天竺，秦言謬者正之以字義，不可譯者即而書之。	「梵音錯者正之以天竺，秦言謬者正之以字義，不可譯者即而書之。	10c	If the Sanskrit is mistaken, correct it with the Indian language. If the Qin words are wrong, correct them with the meaning of the characters. Those that cannot be translated should be written as they are.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0350c28_15']	」豈什公與四子頓爾無識，輒移一品安置經中？	」豈什公與四子頓爾無識，輒移一品安置經中？	10c	How could it be that Kumārajīva and the four disciples suddenly became ignorant and moved a chapter to place it in the sūtra?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a01_7']	若不測旨歸，應仰之而已，何得以凡見斗尺量度大海虛空耶？	若不測旨歸，應仰之而已，何得以凡見斗尺量度大海虛空耶？	10c	If one cannot fathom the purport, one should simply look up to it. How can one use a bucket and a ruler to measure the great ocean and the sky?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a02_3']	二云經論相違者，《法華論》云：	二云經論相違者，《法華論》云：	10c	Second, regarding the contradiction between sūtras and treatises, the Fahua lun says:
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a03_20']	「修行力有五」，第五護法力中云「如〈普賢勸發品〉及後品」，後品即指〈囑累品〉也。	「修行力有五」，第五護法力中云「如〈普賢勸發品〉及後品」，後品即指〈囑累品〉也。	10c	The power of practice has five. In the fifth, the power of protecting the Dharma, it says, As in the Samantabhadra Chapter and the later chapters. The later chapters refer to the Entrustment Chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a04_1']	救曰：	救曰：	10c	The savior says:
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a04_13']	《論》亦人譯，擅指何疑？	《論》亦人譯，擅指何疑？	10c	The treatise is also a human translation. What doubt is there in arbitrarily pointing to it?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a09_22']	況《論》雖西來，譯時既在《正法華》後，秖是譯者順《正法華》故，《正經》在西晉時譯，《論》在後魏時譯，如隋笈多見《正法華．藥草喻》後有一長行偈頌，及〈囑累〉在後，便以《正經》添於品內，及移〈囑累〉在〈勸發〉後，餘無所云，遂使後人云「添品法華」。	況《論》雖西來，譯時既在《正法華》後，秖是譯者順《正法華》故，《正經》在西晉時譯，《論》在後魏時譯，如隋笈多見《正法華．藥草喻》後有一長行偈頌，及〈囑累〉在後，便以《正經》添於品內，及移〈囑累〉在〈勸發〉後，餘無所云，遂使後人云「添品法華」。	10c	Moreover, although the treatise came from the west, when it was translated it was after the Saṃghabhara's Correct Sutra of the Lotus. It was only because the translator followed the Correct Sutra of the Lotus that the Correct Sutra was translated during the Western Jin period, and the treatise was translated during the Later Wei period. Just as when Jñānagupta of the Sui dynasty saw that after the Medicinal Herbs Parable in the Correct Sutra of the Lotus there was a prose section and verses, and that the Entrustment was at the end, he then added the Correct Sutra to the chapter, and moved the Entrustment after the Exhortation. Since there is nothing else mentioned, later people say that the Lotus Sutra with Additional Chapters was added.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a12_6']	故知譯者不妨隨見，《妙》、《正》二本同一梵文，乍可信羅什而寢於法護，安得釋《妙》本專以《論》為憑？	故知譯者不妨隨見，《妙》、《正》二本同一梵文，乍可信羅什而寢於法護，安得釋《妙》本專以《論》為憑？	10c	Therefore, we know that the translators may have followed what they saw. The Wonderful and Correct versions are the same Sanskrit text, and we can believe in Kumārajīva but ignore Dharmarakṣa? How can we explain the Wonderful version solely relying on the treatise?

['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a15_13']	又言「後品」者，既其不出名目，則似經度不盡，若不爾者，何不云「及囑累品」但言後耶？	又言「後品」者，既其不出名目，則似經度不盡，若不爾者，何不云「及囑累品」但言後耶？	10c	Moreover, as for saying the later chapter, since it does not specify a title, it seems that the sutra was not completely translated. If it were not so, why not say and the chapter on entrustment but only say later?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a15_19']	此亦是一見。	此亦是一見。	10c	This is also one view.

['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a18_4']	一切諸經並在經末，如何此經獨在於斯？	一切諸經並在經末，如何此經獨在於斯？	10c	All sutras are at the end of the sutra. How is it that this sutra is alone here?

It is like the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, which has the Chapter on Accumulating Teachings in the middle, and again has the Chapter on Entrustment at the end of the sutra. It cannot be that all are placed in two places.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a21_16']	如《大寶積》四十九會，會會皆有付囑之文，豈令諸經一切皆爾？	如《大寶積》四十九會，會會皆有付囑之文，豈令諸經一切皆爾？	10c	As in the forty-nine assemblies of the Great Treasure Accumulation, each assembly has the text of entrustment, how can it be that all the sūtras are like this?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a23_3']	如《金剛經》問名問持乃在經中，不可一切悉令居中。	如《金剛經》問名問持乃在經中，不可一切悉令居中。	10c	As in the Diamond Sūtra, asking the name and asking to uphold it are in the sūtra, how can it be that everything must be in the middle?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351a24_5']	《法華》開權顯本授聲聞記，豈令一切悉皆顯實？	《法華》開權顯本授聲聞記，豈令一切悉皆顯實？	10c	The Lotus Sūtra reveals the provisional and manifests the fundamental, and bestows the prediction to the śrāvakas, how can it be that everything must be revealed as the true?

In the chapter on entrustment, it also says for the relics of Prabhūtaratna to return to their original place. Avalokiteśvara should not divide the jewels into two. If they are divided into two, then the relics of Prabhūtaratna have not yet returned. Since the sending away is the same, they should not be contradictory.

['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351b01_16']	秖由未還故寶分二，是故但云「一分奉多寶佛塔」，而不云「奉多寶佛」，故知事畢者去、有緣者住，於理何傷？	秖由未還故寶分二，是故但云「一分奉多寶佛塔」，而不云「奉多寶佛」，故知事畢者去、有緣者住，於理何傷？	10c	It is precisely because they have not yet returned that the treasure is divided into two. Therefore, it only says one part is offered to the stūpa of Prabhūtaratna Buddha and does not say offered to Prabhūtaratna Buddha. Therefore, we know that those whose business is finished leave, and those with karmic affinity remain. What harm is there in this principle?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351b03_8']	若多寶在分身不合散者，經文但云「塔可如故」，如故秖是依初還閉；	若多寶在分身不合散者，經文但云「塔可如故」，如故秖是依初還閉；	10c	If Prabhūtaratna were present, the manifestation bodies would not disperse. The sūtra text only says the stūpa can remain as it is. As it is simply means to return to the original state and close it.

Therefore, we know that although it is said that the stūpa should return, because it is allowed to remain in other sūtras, the stūpa is closed and remains, just like when the stūpa was not yet opened, it only says that Prabhūtaratna emitted a great sound from within the jeweled stūpa.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0351b07_13']	又云四眾聞寶塔中所出音聲，大樂說云「於其塔中發是音聲」。	又云四眾聞寶塔中所出音聲，大樂說云「於其塔中發是音聲」。	10c	It also says that the four assemblies heard the sound emitted from within the jeweled stūpa, and Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says emitted this sound from within the stūpa.

How could it be that the manifested bodies were present before his eyes and he did not make offerings to them?

Samantabhadra still bestows it with phrases and does not blame the change of chapters. Moreover, after that, famous monks continued to follow and great learning was like a forest. They all agreed that the entrustment is placed here. How could the view seen in the Tang Dynasty differ from the past?

Taking the small meaning of the One Vehicle and the four virtues as the main point, there is nothing to return to. Based on this, the various examples can be recognized.

If the land is still pure, filled with all Buddhas, Śākyas, and stupas still in the sky, and the ten directions are penetrated by the power of the Buddha's manifestation, why is it necessary to still speak as before and falsely admonish the wonderful sound?

To say that Śākyamuni does not accept benefits for a long time and accords with the six harmonies of respect is to make the sage imitate the ordinary.

If Avalokitesvara does not give, it shows that Avalokitesvara bestows partially, how does it concern the six harmonies and few desires?

The fault of standing and sending after the sutra is in vain, and the dignified image is ridiculed and mocked. In this Wonderful Sutra, it is not yet a great praise.

Now that he has returned to his place, he should also order them to sit down again. How could he allow them to stand for a long time without granting them a place to rest?

If one relies on one's own power and does not seek help from others, being in space is beyond one's own power, so one requests the Buddha's spiritual powers.

Why does Inexhaustible Intention in the Universal Gate Chapter say to rise from one's seat? In the beginning of the Dhāraṇī Chapter, Medicine King rises from his seat. Therefore, we know that we cannot see the abbreviated to sit down and move the chapter to the end.

Therefore, although the title of the Spiritual Powers Chapter says spiritual powers, the chapter says in order to entrust this sūtra, I now use the Tathāgata's four dharmas to entrust to those of superior practice and so on.

If there is a sequence, it will lose the last part.🔽If it is said that the sequence of the sutra text is that after the chapter on the one who is not lightly moved, it should encourage upholding, why is it interspersed with spiritual powers?

The present sutra has twelve thousand śrāvakas, while the Correct Sutra only has one thousand two hundred. Praising the śrāvakas has eleven phrases, while praising the bodhisattvas has twenty-eight phrases. It is also unrelated to the Wonderful Sutra and the Treatise.

It begins with internal understanding and ends with benefiting others, both being within the same name.

Medicine King is also at the beginning of offering mantras, and Pure Virtues also point to the body of Wonderful Sound. Therefore, the five categories of Dharma gates are definitely without superiority or inferiority. They only follow the convenience of the faculties and the different vehicles. Moreover, the Universal Gate is in the middle, and the principle extends to above and below. Using people to correspond with the Dharma, the principle is also equally responsive.

But using the illumination of the east to express the beginning is convenient. If summoning the south to the north, the four directions can be known accordingly.

The light and those summoned still pervade the ten directions, so here only one direction is used to express it.

Since here it is already using the west to respond to the question, it can be used to clarify the west, saying that it wants to speak of the matters of the bodhisattvas in the west, first summoning the bodhisattvas in the east, and so on.

The body is characterized by phenomena, while principle is wondrous emptiness. Even a single particle of the body is equal to principle, let alone a sixteen-foot body giving rise to inferior thoughts?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356a13_13']	次「夫師」等者，佛及弟子身俱劣者，俱隱寂忍而耐其拙。	次「夫師」等者，佛及弟子身俱劣者，俱隱寂忍而耐其拙。	10c	Next, the teacher and so on means that both the Buddha and his disciples have inferior bodies, both concealing their tranquil forbearance and enduring their clumsiness.

The warning to the assembly is the standard for propagating the sutra, so this Buddha also uses the three meanings to exemplify them in propagating the sutra. The manifestation of the Dharma does not go beyond the Buddha's body and the land of transformation.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356a18_16']	「受旨」中三力者，菩薩不無、推功化主。	「受旨」中三力者，菩薩不無、推功化主。	10c	In receiving the order, the three powers means that bodhisattvas are not without, but attribute the merit to the transforming master.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356a20_13']	如來先誡令菩薩自運，菩薩推者往彼實難，何況往復應須利他，故知往來皆如來力。	如來先誡令菩薩自運，菩薩推者往彼實難，何況往復應須利他，故知往來皆如來力。	10c	The Tathagata first admonished the Bodhisattvas to exert themselves. The Bodhisattvas pushed, but going there was truly difficult, let alone going back and forth while also benefiting others. Therefore, we know that going and coming are all the power of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356a22_15']	然又如來加於可加，菩薩有分但未至極，故以極三加於分三，令用弘經宗要衣座室耳。	然又如來加於可加，菩薩有分但未至極，故以極三加於分三，令用弘經宗要衣座室耳。	10c	However, the Tathagata's empowerment is for those who can be empowered. The Bodhisattvas have a share, but have not yet reached the ultimate. Therefore, the ultimate three empower the partial three, enabling them to use the essential robe, seat, and room to promote the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356a25_8']	故知皆如來力起於神通，種種莊嚴方能利物，是則如來以中空故，能以慈悲加諸菩薩，具足莊嚴故隨機利益。	故知皆如來力起於神通，種種莊嚴方能利物，是則如來以中空故，能以慈悲加諸菩薩，具足莊嚴故隨機利益。	10c	Therefore, we know that all arise from the spiritual powers of the Tathagata's power, and only through various adornments can one benefit beings. This means that because the Tathagata is empty in the middle, he can use his compassion to empower the Bodhisattvas, and because he is fully adorned, he benefits beings according to their capacities.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356a25_20']	言「莊嚴」者，因中萬行。	言「莊嚴」者，因中萬行。	10c	As for adornment, it refers to the myriad practices in the causal stage.

How could he come from afar to seek to see one of lower rank? Mañjuśrī is of high rank, he should have recognized the flowers when he saw them. Why did he ask the Buddha for what causes and conditions and so on?
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356b01_17']	答中二義，並文殊位高或同是補處，一位之中分始、中、終，或同是古佛則無高下。	答中二義，並文殊位高或同是補處，一位之中分始、中、終，或同是古佛則無高下。	10c	The answer has two meanings. Both Mañjuśrī and himself are of high rank, or they are both in the position of the next Buddha. Within one position, they distinguish beginning, middle, and end, or they are both ancient Buddhas, so there is no high or low.

The upper chapter of the Medicine King says: In the past, he was named Bodhisattva All Beings' Joyful Vision. In the Dharma of Buddha Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue, he attained the samadhi of manifesting all forms. Later, he was reborn in that land, in the family of King Pure Virtue. He suddenly manifested and said to his father:

If it says I have already attained, it seems to refer to the samadhi of all forms he attained earlier. This samadhi is also named the dharani of language, thus it is called still a form dharma.
['ZH_T34_1719_10c:0356b14_4']	「猶是」之言表與前同，故此語言與色身但是身口之異，豈可現身不能說法，但從事別、其理必同，故作異名消文最便。	「猶是」之言表與前同，故此語言與色身但是身口之異，豈可現身不能說法，但從事別、其理必同，故作異名消文最便。	10c	The word still indicates it is the same as before. Therefore, this language and the form body are only different in body and speech. How can one manifest the body but not be able to speak the Dharma? It is just that the affairs are different, but the principle must be the same. Therefore, using different names to explain the text is the most convenient.

Samādhi comes from concentration, and dhāraṇī comes from wisdom. Because it is the inconceivable concentration and wisdom, they can be used interchangeably. According to the explanation below, the three wheels are complete.
