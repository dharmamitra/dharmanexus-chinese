['ZH_T36_1739_013:0801b11_6']	二令諸現在未來始發菩提心者，識佛所行及菩薩行海，佛菩薩大慈悲海，能普遍法界海、眾生行業海而利益之，令到究竟岸故。	二令諸現在未來始發菩提心者，識佛所行及菩薩行海，佛菩薩大慈悲海，能普遍法界海、眾生行業海而利益之，令到究竟岸故。	Second, it is for those who have newly given rise to the bodhi mind in the present and future to recognize the ocean of the Buddha's practices and the bodhisattvas' practices, the ocean of the Buddha's and bodhisattvas' great compassion, which can universally benefit the ocean of the Dharma realm and the ocean of sentient beings' karmic practices, causing them to reach the ultimate shore.

['ZH_T36_1739_013:0801b16_3']	四令始發心者，知眾生界廣大，等法界虛空界，如影相入重重無盡，依住各別，佛菩薩行悉充滿故。	四令始發心者，知眾生界廣大，等法界虛空界，如影相入重重無盡，依住各別，佛菩薩行悉充滿故。	Fourth, it is to make those who have just begun to generate the mind of enlightenment know that the realm of sentient beings is vast, equal to the realm of Dharma and the realm of space, like shadows entering each other in layers without end, relying on each other separately, and the practices of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are all completely fulfilled.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0801b18_17']	五令始發心菩薩，知諸佛菩薩境界海、眾生境界海一異不可得故，隨眾生自業轉變剎海轉變故，隨自業成壞剎海成壞故。	五令始發心菩薩，知諸佛菩薩境界海、眾生境界海一異不可得故，隨眾生自業轉變剎海轉變故，隨自業成壞剎海成壞故。	Fifth, it is to make Bodhisattvas who have just begun to generate the mind of enlightenment know that the ocean of realms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and the ocean of realms of sentient beings are neither the same nor different, because they follow the transformations of sentient beings' own karma and the transformations of the ocean of lands, and because they follow the formation and destruction of their own karma and the formation and destruction of the ocean of lands.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0801b19_15']	以此眾因緣故，此品須來，發初蒙故。	以此眾因緣故，此品須來，發初蒙故。	For these many reasons, this chapter is necessary, because it causes the initial generation of the mind of enlightenment.

['ZH_T36_1739_013:0801b24_15']	以是義故，如下頌云「離諸諂誑心清淨，常樂慈悲性歡喜，志欲廣大深信人，彼聞此法生欣悅。	以是義故，如下頌云「離諸諂誑心清淨，常樂慈悲性歡喜，志欲廣大深信人，彼聞此法生欣悅。	For this reason, as stated in the following verse, Free from flattery and deceit, with a pure mind, always delighting in loving-kindness and compassion, with a joyful nature, having vast aspirations and deep faith, they will rejoice upon hearing this Dharma.

Therefore, there are one's own Buddha, other Buddhas, and divisions of lands and realms, and there are places of coming and going that one relies on.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0801c03_7']	如三乘中所說淨土在於他方，菩薩願生其中是也。	如三乘中所說淨土在於他方，菩薩願生其中是也。	It is like the pure lands described in the three vehicles, which are said to be in other directions, and bodhisattvas aspire to be born there.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0801c06_8']	說此品者，意欲令初發菩提心者，知眾生境界、諸佛境界廣大之相，重重無礙無盡之相，佛及菩薩願行含覆利益纖塵無遺故，此品須來。	說此品者，意欲令初發菩提心者，知眾生境界、諸佛境界廣大之相，重重無礙無盡之相，佛及菩薩願行含覆利益纖塵無遺故，此品須來。	The purpose of expounding this chapter is to cause those who first give rise to the mind of enlightenment to know the vast characteristics of the realms of sentient beings and buddhas, the characteristics of layer upon layer without obstruction and without end, and the vows and practices of buddhas and bodhisattvas that encompass and benefit without exception, therefore this chapter is necessary.

['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c08_6']	三釋華藏世界海因何報得者，以從初信心至於八地已來，恒以大志願力持，令其不退菩提，諸波羅蜜海教化饒益一切眾生，至於八地任利無功。	三釋華藏世界海因何報得者，以從初信心至於八地已來，恒以大志願力持，令其不退菩提，諸波羅蜜海教化饒益一切眾生，至於八地任利無功。	Third, explaining why the Flower Treasury World Ocean is obtained through retribution: from the initial stage of faith up to the eighth ground, one always uses the power of great aspiration to prevent one's non-retrogression from bodhi, and the ocean of perfections to benefit all sentient beings. By the eighth ground, benefiting is effortless.

It is the retribution obtained by the Dharma body and great wisdom of great vows.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c12_16']	風輪之體若不以法身，一切諸行總有為故。	風輪之體若不以法身，一切諸行總有為故。	If the substance of the wind wheel is not the Dharma body, then all practices are impermanent.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c13_16']	若無志願，法身無性不能自成，何況成他。	若無志願，法身無性不能自成，何況成他。	If there is no aspiration, the Dharma body has no nature and cannot be accomplished by itself, let alone accomplishing others.

Therefore, the text below says, Scattering maṇi jewels and wonderful flower clouds, abiding in the sky by the power of past vows.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c18_11', 'ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c19_10']	」如是華藏世界所有莊嚴，總是風輪上持諸境。🔽由諸福行本從願生，還將本因以持諸果。	」如是華藏世界所有莊嚴，總是風輪上持諸境。 由諸福行本從願生，還將本因以持諸果。	In this way, all the adornments of the Flower Treasury world are upheld by the wind wheel above, holding the various realms.🔽All meritorious practices originally arise from vows, and one still uses the original causes to uphold the various fruits.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c20_19']	以此用願波羅蜜，能成一切諸波羅蜜，以本因如此，故因果相持。	以此用願波羅蜜，能成一切諸波羅蜜，以本因如此，故因果相持。	Using this to practice the perfection of vows, one is able to accomplish all perfections. Since the original causes are like this, cause and effect uphold each other.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c24_4']	今以第八及初發心時願波羅蜜中十波羅蜜，以成十種風輪，用持其上十種一切莊嚴，以願波羅蜜互體相參，能持其上諸行報得一切莊嚴。	今以第八及初發心時願波羅蜜中十波羅蜜，以成十種風輪，用持其上十種一切莊嚴，以願波羅蜜互體相參，能持其上諸行報得一切莊嚴。	Now, using the eighth and the ten perfections of the vow perfection at the time of first generating the mind, they form ten kinds of wind wheels to support the ten kinds of all adornments above them. Using the mutual essence of the vow perfections, they can support the various practices and rewards of all adornments above them.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c26_4']	如最下風輪名平等住，是願波羅蜜中檀波羅蜜報得故，能持其上一切寶焰熾然莊嚴。	如最下風輪名平等住，是願波羅蜜中檀波羅蜜報得故，能持其上一切寶焰熾然莊嚴。	Like the lowest wind wheel, named equally abiding, which is the reward of the giving perfection within the vow perfection, it can support the blazing adornment of all jewels above it.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c27_10']	還是願波羅蜜中檀度門法財惠施之所報生，還自相持。	還是願波羅蜜中檀度門法財惠施之所報生，還自相持。	This is still the reward born from the giving gateway of the vow perfection's dāna pāramitā, which itself mutually supports.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c28_4']	因果相徹，法不虛得，因不唐捐。	因果相徹，法不虛得，因不唐捐。	Cause and effect penetrate each other, the Dharma is not obtained in vain, and the cause is not wasted.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0802c29_14']	以准此用願波羅蜜中十度法門配之十種風輪，報得因果相持故。	以准此用願波羅蜜中十度法門配之十種風輪，報得因果相持故。	Using this to match the ten kinds of wind wheels with the ten perfections of the Dharma gates within the vow perfection, the rewards of cause and effect mutually support each other.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0803a02_19']	還如眾生世間妄想，業風最居其下，上持水際金剛地山，令其安住孛像玄光，以成天文運遊不墮。	還如眾生世間妄想，業風最居其下，上持水際金剛地山，令其安住孛像玄光，以成天文運遊不墮。	It is like the sentient beings' world, with the wind of karma at the very bottom, holding up the water's edge, the vajra ground, and the mountains, causing them to abide stably. The mysterious light of the asterisms forms the celestial phenomena, moving without falling.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0803a06_8']	蓮華藏體是法身隨行無依住智體之所報得，及宮殿總大悲含育之所報得，樓閣即是智照觀根順悲濟物之所報得，其地金剛平等自性法身之所報得。	蓮華藏體是法身隨行無依住智體之所報得，及宮殿總大悲含育之所報得，樓閣即是智照觀根順悲濟物之所報得，其地金剛平等自性法身之所報得。	The body of the Lotus Treasury is the Dharma body, the retribution of the wisdom of following practices without abiding, and the palace is the retribution of the great compassion that encompasses and nurtures. The multi-storied pavilions are the retribution of the wisdom that illuminates and observes the faculties, following compassion to save beings. The ground of vajra is the retribution of the Dharma body of equality and self-nature.
['ZH_T36_1739_013:0803a07_14']	但是諸莊嚴中，所有金剛為莊嚴者，皆法身隨行之報得。	但是諸莊嚴中，所有金剛為莊嚴者，皆法身隨行之報得。	However, among all the adornments, those adorned with vajra are all the retribution of the Dharma body's following practices.
