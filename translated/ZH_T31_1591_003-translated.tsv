['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b17_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b17_17']	㮈洛迦波羅如獵鹿者，如是應知。	㮈洛迦波羅如獵鹿者，如是應知。	Like a hunter who shoots deer, one should understand it in this way.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b19_11']	非但不受相害之苦，然於器處共相之苦亦復不受，此之獄卒能害彼故。	非但不受相害之苦，然於器處共相之苦亦復不受，此之獄卒能害彼故。	Not only do they not experience the suffering of mutual harm, but they also do not experience the suffering of the shared characteristics of the environment. Because these jailers are able to harm them.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b21_4']	若異此者，彼在熱鐵融沸地上受燒然苦不能忍時，如何此際能逼害他？	若異此者，彼在熱鐵融沸地上受燒然苦不能忍時，如何此際能逼害他？	If it were otherwise, when they are unable to endure the suffering of being burned on the ground of molten iron, how could they at that time oppress and harm others?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b22_16']	於此熱地身動轉時，那洛迦類自身支節尚不能持，豈況更能有所為作？	於此熱地身動轉時，那洛迦類自身支節尚不能持，豈況更能有所為作？	When moving and turning on this hot ground, the bodies and limbs of the hell beings are unable to support themselves, let alone be able to do anything else?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b25_17']	然而但可於熱鐵中洋沸騰湧，身由他制無片自在，然彼獄卒勇健害他，是故定知不受彼苦，猶若厨人遙執鐵鏟，於熱油內轉彼煎魚。	然而但可於熱鐵中洋沸騰湧，身由他制無片自在，然彼獄卒勇健害他，是故定知不受彼苦，猶若厨人遙執鐵鏟，於熱油內轉彼煎魚。	However, they can only be melted and boiled in red-hot iron, their bodies controlled by others without the slightest independence. Yet those jailers are brave and harmful to others, so it is definitely known that they do not experience that suffering, just as a cook holding an iron spatula in boiling oil turns the frying fish.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b27_6']	或將獄卒為那洛迦，以其相害無功能故，爾者便成違獄卒義。	或將獄卒為那洛迦，以其相害無功能故，爾者便成違獄卒義。	Or perhaps the jailers are considered hell beings, because they are unable to harm each other. In that case, it would contradict the meaning of jailer.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085b29_12']	然由那洛迦類受燒害時不能相害，若爾便成不是獄卒，言那洛迦㮈洛迦波羅立為宗者，有違宗過。	然由那洛迦類受燒害時不能相害，若爾便成不是獄卒，言那洛迦㮈洛迦波羅立為宗者，有違宗過。	However, when the various hell beings experience being burned and harmed, they are unable to harm each other. If that is so, then they would not be jailers. If one establishes the thesis that hell beings are hell beings, there is the fault of contradicting one's own thesis.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c02_5']	又復若言受彼熱鐵極苦觸故，諸那洛迦不能害彼，如以生命置炎炭中。	又復若言受彼熱鐵極苦觸故，諸那洛迦不能害彼，如以生命置炎炭中。	Moreover, if one says that because they experience the extreme suffering of hot iron, the various hell beings are unable to harm each other, like placing a living being in burning charcoal.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c03_8']	或可斯類不霑此苦，如覩史天，此顯獄卒非那洛迦。	或可斯類不霑此苦，如覩史天，此顯獄卒非那洛迦。	Or perhaps this type does not experience that suffering, like the Tuṣita gods. This shows that the jailers are not hell beings.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c05_6']	即於此見外人別釋，引經為證極成乖失，然而暫為少慧之輩，顯其僻見略舉疏條。	即於此見外人別釋，引經為證極成乖失，然而暫為少慧之輩，顯其僻見略舉疏條。	Right here, the outsider gives a separate explanation of this view, citing a sutra as evidence, which is extremely mistaken. However, for the sake of those with little wisdom, I will briefly outline his biased views.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c05_11']	彼便難曰：	彼便難曰：	He then raises an objection, saying:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c06_10']	於地獄處，獄卒之流不受苦者，我不許故。	於地獄處，獄卒之流不受苦者，我不許故。	I do not accept that the wardens in the hells do not experience suffering.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c06_15']	如經說云：	如經說云：	As the sutra says:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c06_20']	汝等苾芻！	汝等苾芻！	'You bhikṣus!
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c08_16']	有㮈洛迦名六觸處，若諸有情生在彼中，彼若以眼視諸色時，咸悉了見不可愛事。	有㮈洛迦名六觸處，若諸有情生在彼中，彼若以眼視諸色時，咸悉了見不可愛事。	There is an Avīci hell called the Six Sense Bases. If sentient beings are born there, when they use their eyes to see forms, they all see only unpleasant things.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c09_16']	實彼有情有如斯事，獄卒非情，何所觀見？	實彼有情有如斯事，獄卒非情，何所觀見？	It is true that sentient beings have such experiences, but the wardens are not sentient beings. What do they see?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c10_14']	對執不許有情論者，便是共聚咀嚼虛空。	對執不許有情論者，便是共聚咀嚼虛空。	If one argues that sentient beings do not exist, it is like chewing on empty space.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c10_19']	彼設難云：	彼設難云：	He raises an objection, saying:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c12_8']	諸那洛迦受彼苦時，有其差別，得異身故，如一無間、多無間罪。	諸那洛迦受彼苦時，有其差別，得異身故，如一無間、多無間罪。	When the various hell beings experience that suffering, there is a difference, because they obtain different bodies, like one uninterrupted [sin] and many uninterrupted [sins].
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c13_2']	此亦未能閑他意趣，如前所云。	此亦未能閑他意趣，如前所云。	This person is still unable to understand the intended meaning, as stated before.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c14_18']	生㮈洛迦有情之類受苦切時，簡於餘趣所有苦毒，然彼獄中所有共苦咸悉同受。	生㮈洛迦有情之類受苦切時，簡於餘趣所有苦毒，然彼獄中所有共苦咸悉同受。	When sentient beings born in the hells are experiencing intense suffering, compared to the suffering of other realms, the shared suffering in those hells is all experienced equally.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c16_7']	然於彼處由重業風驚飈猛烈身遭極苦，一無間者則不受之。	然於彼處由重業風驚飈猛烈身遭極苦，一無間者則不受之。	However, in that place, due to the heavy karmic winds, the violent and fierce body experiences extreme suffering, and one who is uninterrupted does not experience it.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c17_6']	望彼多種無間猛苦，不同受故便成不定。	望彼多種無間猛苦，不同受故便成不定。	Compared to the many kinds of uninterrupted intense suffering, since it is not experienced equally, it becomes indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c18_14']	為顯斯事，除彼獄卒，諸那洛迦無斯差別，彼趣同苦咸悉受故。	為顯斯事，除彼獄卒，諸那洛迦無斯差別，彼趣同苦咸悉受故。	In order to illustrate this matter, excluding those hell wardens, the various hell beings have no such distinction, because they all experience the shared suffering of that realm.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c19_13']	即所立宗無異宗處，轉生道理何成不定？	即所立宗無異宗處，轉生道理何成不定？	Then, in the established thesis, where there is no difference in the thesis, how can the principle of transformation be indeterminate?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c20_3']	然一無間受同苦故。	然一無間受同苦故。	However, because one who is uninterrupted experiences the shared suffering.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c20_8']	有外難云：	有外難云：	There is an external objection:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c21_7']	由其獄卒不受苦者，斯非正答，有不定故。	由其獄卒不受苦者，斯非正答，有不定故。	Since the hell wardens do not experience suffering, this is not a correct answer, because it is indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c22_5']	然且不應作斯定判，見一受苦令餘亦然。	然且不應作斯定判，見一受苦令餘亦然。	However, one should not make such a definite judgment, seeing that one experiences suffering and causing others to be the same.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c23_17']	現見世間共覩斯事，如羊駱駝被蠍蜇時遂便致死，鳥之一分將以為食。	現見世間共覩斯事，如羊駱駝被蠍蜇時遂便致死，鳥之一分將以為食。	We can see this happening in the world. When a sheep or a camel is stung by a scorpion, it dies, and birds eat it.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c25_7']	且據傍生有斯差異，於人趣中亦復見有一不受苦，如患塊者。	且據傍生有斯差異，於人趣中亦復見有一不受苦，如患塊者。	This is a difference among animals. We also see that among humans, there are some who do not experience suffering, like those with a disease of the abdomen.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c27_8']	醫人遂便蹈熱鐵上，即以熱脚蹋于病處，病人雖受極苦，醫足曾無痛處，然而有情實無差別。	醫人遂便蹈熱鐵上，即以熱脚蹋于病處，病人雖受極苦，醫足曾無痛處，然而有情實無差別。	A doctor steps on hot iron, then with his hot foot he steps on the patient's abdomen. Although the patient experiences extreme pain, the doctor's foot is never painful. However, sentient beings are truly without distinction.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0085c28_16']	此亦由其㮈洛迦趣俱生苦法，以不見故遂不名此為那洛迦。	此亦由其㮈洛迦趣俱生苦法，以不見故遂不名此為那洛迦。	This is also because in the animal realm, there are innate dharmas of suffering, and because they are not seen, they are not called narakas.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a01_10']	見蜇毒等能斷命根，此亦但是呈其廣見巧識俗途，非關所論契理之事。	見蜇毒等能斷命根，此亦但是呈其廣見巧識俗途，非關所論契理之事。	Seeing that stings and poisons can sever the life root, this is also just presenting their extensive views and skillful knowledge of worldly paths, not concerning the matter of discussing the principle.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a04_10']	若云但據趣之相似是彼趣收，於斯宗處，即彼趣中見有不受彼趣之苦，顯他宗有不定過者，此亦未解我成立義當趣所有決定之苦。	若云但據趣之相似是彼趣收，於斯宗處，即彼趣中見有不受彼趣之苦，顯他宗有不定過者，此亦未解我成立義當趣所有決定之苦。	If you say that it is only based on the similarity of the realms that they are included in those realms, and in this school there is seen to be no suffering of those realms that is not accepted, and it is shown that there is an indefinite fault in the other school, this is also not yet an understanding of my established meaning of the suffering that is certain to exist in those realms.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a05_14']	彼不共受是前作用能立義故，然非人畜在彼趣生。	彼不共受是前作用能立義故，然非人畜在彼趣生。	That which is not commonly experienced is the previous function that can establish the meaning, and therefore humans and animals are not born in those realms.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a08_10']	准彼法式，須定受者而不受之，所云羊等遭蠍毒時有斷命苦，或被熱足所生之痛，若全不受，彼趣苦故非彼趣性可有斯愆。	准彼法式，須定受者而不受之，所云羊等遭蠍毒時有斷命苦，或被熱足所生之痛，若全不受，彼趣苦故非彼趣性可有斯愆。	According to their methods, that which must be definitely experienced but is not experienced, the so-called suffering of sheep and others being bitten by scorpions and having their lives cut off, or the pain born of hot feet, if completely not experienced, because the suffering of those realms does not exist, the nature of those realms may have this fault.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a08_15']	有異執云：	有異執云：	There is a different interpretation that says:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a10_4']	然而獄卒由自他業增上所生，不被害故互相苦刻，他不許也。	然而獄卒由自他業增上所生，不被害故互相苦刻，他不許也。	However, because the wardens of hell are born from the dominant power of their own and others' karma, they are not harmed, and therefore they mutually inflict suffering, which others do not allow.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a11_7']	我今謂汝而於自見樂著昏心，設在虛空步步顛蹶。	我今謂汝而於自見樂著昏心，設在虛空步步顛蹶。	I now say to you that you are confused by your attachment to your own views, and even if you were in empty space, you would stumble at every step.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a12_17']	㮈洛迦波羅非他所害故，他逼所生所有苦痛必定不受，是其所許。	㮈洛迦波羅非他所害故，他逼所生所有苦痛必定不受，是其所許。	Because the hell of Avīci is not harmed by others, all the pain and suffering produced by others is definitely not experienced, this is what they accept.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a13_16']	然而執云不受彼處形害苦者，與誰助力？	然而執云不受彼處形害苦者，與誰助力？	However, if one holds that one does not experience the suffering of bodily harm in that place, with whom does one assist?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a14_2']	此轉難曰：	此轉難曰：	This is a counter-argument:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a15_10']	雖復有斯更互相害，由作用別致使位殊，猶如所縛能縛之異。	雖復有斯更互相害，由作用別致使位殊，猶如所縛能縛之異。	Although there is this mutual harm, due to the difference in function, it causes the distinction in status, just like the difference between the bound and the binder.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a17_1']	爾者還將自語返破己宗，由匪同時能縛所縛更互容為繫絆之事。	爾者還將自語返破己宗，由匪同時能縛所縛更互容為繫絆之事。	Then, using one's own words to refute one's own school, because the binder and the bound cannot simultaneously accommodate each other's binding affairs.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a18_13']	若言彼二次第而為，此亦非理，由非受繫名為被縛，及其縛彼為能縛者。	若言彼二次第而為，此亦非理，由非受繫名為被縛，及其縛彼為能縛者。	If it is said that the two are bound in sequence, this is also unreasonable, because being bound is not called being bound, and when binding the other, one becomes the binder.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a19_12']	然而此二縱令苦次，於那洛迦亦不能立。	然而此二縱令苦次，於那洛迦亦不能立。	However, these two, even if the suffering is sequential, cannot establish the hell of Avīci.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a21_19', 'ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a23_6']	若受墋毒極苦之時非那洛迦，若被他害遭彼惱時是那洛迦，是不應許一相續形有生有死，成大過故。🔽同在一時更互相害，不容成故，由非一念是卒還非能為此計。	若受墋毒極苦之時非那洛迦，若被他害遭彼惱時是那洛迦，是不應許一相續形有生有死，成大過故。 同在一時更互相害，不容成故，由非一念是卒還非能為此計。	If one is experiencing the extremely painful poison of hell, one is not a hell being. If one is being harmed by others and experiencing that suffering, one is a hell being. This is not acceptable, because it would lead to the great error that a single continuum would have both birth and death.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a25_9']	若救轉計，雖同一趣由作用別名號便異，一名那洛迦、一號獄卒，猶如人趣非典獄者有被枷者。	若救轉計，雖同一趣由作用別名號便異，一名那洛迦、一號獄卒，猶如人趣非典獄者有被枷者。	Because it is not possible for them to harm each other at the same time, this theory cannot be established. If one were to argue that even though they belong to the same realm, they are called by different names due to the difference in their functions, one being called a hell being and the other a jailer, just as in the human realm there are those who are not jailers but are chained up,
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a25_19']	此亦非理，不託彼故。	此亦非理，不託彼故。	this is also unreasonable, because they do not rely on each other.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086a27_16']	由非仗託作用差別說那洛迦如被縛者，然此但由趣為因故，斯乃如何捨其獄卒？	由非仗託作用差別說那洛迦如被縛者，然此但由趣為因故，斯乃如何捨其獄卒？	Because hell beings are not said to be chained up in dependence on the difference in their functions, but rather only because of the cause of the realm. So how can one abandon being a jailer?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b01_4']	是故定知位有差別，由非趣同作斯緣緒能所縛殊，由作用別之所為故，理應隨彼而作分位，誠無有違。	是故定知位有差別，由非趣同作斯緣緒能所縛殊，由作用別之所為故，理應隨彼而作分位，誠無有違。	Therefore, it is definitely known that there are distinctions in status. This is because the same destinies cannot be the conditions for this, and the distinctions of what is bound and what binds are due to the differences in function. Therefore, it is reasonable to make distinctions based on them, and there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b02_7']	若時許樂階位別者，應須共許諸那洛迦非獄卒也。	若時許樂階位別者，應須共許諸那洛迦非獄卒也。	If you allow that there are distinctions in status, then you must agree that not all hell beings are wardens.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b03_10']	於我所宗唯爾是要，由此與前能立之義善符順故。	於我所宗唯爾是要，由此與前能立之義善符順故。	In my school, this is the only essential point. Because of this, it is in good agreement with the thesis to be established.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b04_15']	若許實有那洛迦性，由作用別，有時名作掌獄者故。	若許實有那洛迦性，由作用別，有時名作掌獄者故。	If you allow that there really is the nature of a hell being, then because of the distinctions in function, sometimes they are called wardens.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b05_17']	斯之執見所有階位便成無失，然則許有階級殊途。	斯之執見所有階位便成無失，然則許有階級殊途。	This view and its distinctions are not without fault. However, it is allowed that there are distinctions in status.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b06_3']	如有頌云：	如有頌云：	As a verse says:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b07_0']	多瞋為墋業，　　好行罪惡事，	多瞋為墋業，　　好行罪惡事，	Those with much hatred and evil karma, who delight in doing sinful and evil things,
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b08_13']	見苦心歡悅，　　當生琰摩卒。	見苦心歡悅，　　當生琰摩卒。	who are delighted in their hearts when they see suffering, will be born as wardens of Yama.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b09_8']	由非此相那洛迦有。	由非此相那洛迦有。	Because hell beings do not have these characteristics.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b10_7']	若此伽他是實義者，如何輒爾作如是言：	若此伽他是實義者，如何輒爾作如是言：	If this verse is of definitive meaning, how can you say this:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b10_16']	其獄卒等非有情數？	其獄卒等非有情數？	The wardens of hell and so forth are not sentient beings?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b11_16']	隨那洛迦所見之相作如斯說，理復何違？	隨那洛迦所見之相作如斯說，理復何違？	Following the appearances seen by the hell beings, this is said. What contradiction is there in principle?
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b13_1']	諸近見者，由覩於他舉動差別為所量故，測度彼心。	諸近見者，由覩於他舉動差別為所量故，測度彼心。	Those who observe closely infer the minds of others based on the differences in their movements and actions.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b16_6']	然本在識種子熟時，隨有如是相狀差別而起分別，隨彼所見佛作斯說，欲令波跛惡業有情斷除罪見，於㮈洛迦極惡之處彰顯惡業所生苦報。	然本在識種子熟時，隨有如是相狀差別而起分別，隨彼所見佛作斯說，欲令波跛惡業有情斷除罪見，於㮈洛迦極惡之處彰顯惡業所生苦報。	However, when the seeds of consciousness are ripe, they give rise to discriminations with such and such appearances and characteristics. Following what they see, the Buddha makes this statement, wishing to cause sentient beings with evil karma to eliminate their sinful views and manifest the painful retributions born from evil karma in the extremely evil places of hell.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b17_1']	隨彼情見，於其識外說非愛事。	隨彼情見，於其識外說非愛事。	Following their emotional views, they speak of unpleasant things outside of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b18_1']	礭論實理，咸是內緣似相而現，固無違也。	礭論實理，咸是內緣似相而現，固無違也。	If we firmly discuss the true principle, they all appear as similar characteristics of internal conditions. There is certainly no contradiction.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b19_4']	有異執云：	有異執云：	There is another view that says:
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b21_11']	雖復更相俱為苦害，此等階級不越常途，由非此時有其定位，被害之者名那洛迦、能害之人號波羅矣。	雖復更相俱為苦害，此等階級不越常途，由非此時有其定位，被害之者名那洛迦、能害之人號波羅矣。	Although they harm each other, this is not beyond the usual course of events, because at this time there is no fixed position. The one who is harmed is called a hell being, and the one who harms is called a jailer.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b22_14']	是故定知諸那洛迦正被害時，無有便成獄卒之過。	是故定知諸那洛迦正被害時，無有便成獄卒之過。	Therefore, it is definitely known that when the various hell beings are being harmed, there is no fault of suddenly becoming jailers.
['ZH_T31_1591_003:0086b24_3']	執此計時，於我所成獄卒事用，曾無片許令愛樂耶。	執此計時，於我所成獄卒事用，曾無片許令愛樂耶。	Do you have even the slightest fondness for the function of jailers that I have established?
