['ZH_T42_1828_02a:0336b10_10']	此後現行。	此後現行。	02a	the subsequent actualization
['ZH_T42_1828_02a:0336b10_15']	亦無過失。	亦無過失。	02a	is also without fault.
['ZH_T42_1828_02a:0336b11_12']	釋論第二師依離煩惱欲有前二過失。	釋論第二師依離煩惱欲有前二過失。	02a	The second teacher of the commentary, based on being free from afflictive desire, has the previous two faults.
