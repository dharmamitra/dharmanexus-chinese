['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b18_1']	初二二句依何得名？	初二二句依何得名？	On what basis are the first two sentences named?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b19_7']	若第三句當此品者，若約小乘得作此說，不合釋此。	若第三句當此品者，若約小乘得作此說，不合釋此。	If the third sentence corresponds to this chapter, if it is based on the Lesser Vehicle, this can be said, but it is not appropriate to explain this.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b20_13']	若法執中見等，聲聞領時合入七地，云何猶在初信心耶？	若法執中見等，聲聞領時合入七地，云何猶在初信心耶？	If it is the view and so forth in the grasping of dharmas, when the Hearers accept it, it should be included in the seventh ground, so how can it still be in the initial stage of faith?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b21_10']	有人以通大地信數慧數為信解體。	有人以通大地信數慧數為信解體。	Some people take the number of faith and the number of wisdom in the universal ground of consciousness as the essence of belief and understanding.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b21_18']	今問，體是何義？	今問，體是何義？	I now ask, what is the meaning of essence?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b22_4']	指心所耶？	指心所耶？	Does it refer to the mental factors?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b22_13']	如此心所聖位攝耶？	如此心所聖位攝耶？	Are such mental factors included in the holy stage?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b22_18']	凡位攝耶？	凡位攝耶？	Are they included in the ordinary stage?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b23_8']	若聖位者大小聖耶？	若聖位者大小聖耶？	If they are in the holy stage, are they the holy ones of the Lesser or Great Vehicle?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b23_17']	小非今意大深淺耶？	小非今意大深淺耶？	The Lesser Vehicle is not the meaning of now, is the Great Vehicle profound or shallow?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b24_7']	況今聞實而領解耶？	況今聞實而領解耶？	How much more so now that they hear the truth and understand it?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b25_17']	故信解今經已入初住，則非小乘心所所攝，舉一例諸餘皆準此。	故信解今經已入初住，則非小乘心所所攝，舉一例諸餘皆準此。	Therefore, understanding and believing in this sutra has already entered the initial stage of residence, and is not included in the mental activities of the Lesser Vehicle. Taking one as an example, the rest can all be understood in this way.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274b26_11']	有人云對前七異不成異也。	有人云對前七異不成異也。	Some people say that compared to the previous seven differences, it does not constitute a difference.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c01_14']	一所從異，今謂不然，三根聞略悉生疑動執，但信解前後何得云身子從疑，此中從執有疑必執有執必疑，況疑執名通而須簡小，小乘疑執見道已除，安隔二酥仍須互立？	一所從異，今謂不然，三根聞略悉生疑動執，但信解前後何得云身子從疑，此中從執有疑必執有執必疑，況疑執名通而須簡小，小乘疑執見道已除，安隔二酥仍須互立？	The present view is that this is not so. The three faculties hear the brief and all give rise to doubt and agitation in their attachments. But the understanding and belief are before and after. How can it be said that Śāriputra's is from doubt, and this one is from attachment? There must be doubt in attachment, and there must be attachment in doubt. How much more so when the names of doubt and attachment are common, and it is necessary to distinguish the Lesser Vehicle? The Lesser Vehicle's doubt and attachment are eliminated upon seeing the truth. How can it be separated from the two refined nectars, and still be necessary to establish them mutually?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c03_16']	二廣略異者，此亦不爾，但文異義同，故身子云將非魔等，及述五佛言略意廣豈名略耶？	二廣略異者，此亦不爾，但文異義同，故身子云將非魔等，及述五佛言略意廣豈名略耶？	Second, the difference of being extensive and brief is also not so. It is only that the text is different, but the meaning is the same. Therefore, Śāriputra says, Is this not the work of Māra? and recounts the words of the five Buddhas as brief and the meaning as extensive. How can it be called brief?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c06_2']	三遠近異，此亦不爾，文義俱同，非但此文述道樹前，身子述本著邪見時亦過道樹，故無異也。	三遠近異，此亦不爾，文義俱同，非但此文述道樹前，身子述本著邪見時亦過道樹，故無異也。	Third, the difference in distance is also not so. The text and meaning are the same. Not only does this text describe before the Bodhi tree, but when Śāriputra describes his past attachment to wrong views, it also exceeds the Bodhi tree, so there is no difference.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c06_13']	四通別異者，此亦不爾。	四通別異者，此亦不爾。	Fourth, the difference in general and specific is also not so.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c09_16']	文異意同，身子既云我等不預，又云我等同入法性，又云若我等待說所因，又云我等不解方便，敘失之文四度云等，豈有述得別在一身？	文異意同，身子既云我等不預，又云我等同入法性，又云若我等待說所因，又云我等不解方便，敘失之文四度云等，豈有述得別在一身？	The text is different but the meaning is the same. Since Śāriputra says we were not included, and also says we equally enter the nature of dharmas, and also says if we waited for the explanation of the cause, and also says we did not understand the skillful means, the text describing the loss says we four times. How could the description of the attainment be separate in one person?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c11_5']	此雖列四僧首又局，是則身子通及一切，迦葉別在四人。	此雖列四僧首又局，是則身子通及一切，迦葉別在四人。	Although this lists the four leaders of the assembly, it is limited. This means that Śāriputra is general and all, while Kāśyapa is specific to the four people.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c11_17']	若爾，初周何不多記聲聞？	若爾，初周何不多記聲聞？	If so, why were not many of the śrāvakas predicted in the first chapter?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c11_19']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c12_8']	四眾八部即其人也。	四眾八部即其人也。	The fourfold assembly and the eight groups are the people.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c12_13']	第五不論。	第五不論。	The fifth is not discussed.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c13_4']	六歡喜異者，此亦不然。	六歡喜異者，此亦不然。	Fifth, the difference in joy is also not so.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c15_1']	若言身子獨有先憂後喜，前置等言則憂通一切，故知喜雖前後憂無等降。	若言身子獨有先憂後喜，前置等言則憂通一切，故知喜雖前後憂無等降。	If it is said that only Śāriputra had worry before and joy later, and the word equally is placed first, then worry is common to all. Therefore, it is known that although joy is before and after, worry has no equal or decrease.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c15_17']	七云一四不同，不爾之意亦如向破。	七云一四不同，不爾之意亦如向破。	The seventh says that the differences between the one and the four are not so, and the meaning of not so is also as refuted above.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c16_6']	有引《婆沙》云：	有引《婆沙》云：	Some cite the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra, which says:
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c17_14']	身子上、目連中，餘皆下者，其語似同彼小今實，文意永異不可雷同。	身子上、目連中，餘皆下者，其語似同彼小今實，文意永異不可雷同。	Śāriputra is superior, Maudgalyāyana is middling, and the others are all inferior. Their words seem similar to the small now, but the meaning of the text is completely different and cannot be lumped together.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c19_4']	《正法華》名「信樂品」，其義雖通樂不及解，今明領解何以云樂？	《正法華》名「信樂品」，其義雖通樂不及解，今明領解何以云樂？	The Saṃghabhedavastu is called the Chapter on Faith and Joy, and its meaning is generally the same as joy, but it is not as good as understanding. Now, in explaining the understanding, why is it said to be joy?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c20_10']	今未釋品名，便引古人判品意者，釋題失所由失文意。	今未釋品名，便引古人判品意者，釋題失所由失文意。	Now, before explaining the chapter title, citing the ancient people's judgment of the chapter's meaning, the explanation of the title is lost, and therefore the meaning of the text is lost.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c23_3']	於中初通列三時云一往等者，以此品內具領始末，退大之後更以小起，以為一往，中間為隨逐，最後為畢竟。	於中初通列三時云一往等者，以此品內具領始末，退大之後更以小起，以為一往，中間為隨逐，最後為畢竟。	In this, first generally listing the three periods, saying one time, etc. is because this chapter contains the beginning and end, after retreating from the great, using the small again as one time, the middle as following, and the last as final.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c23_17']	古人但得三時之名，不了其意。	古人但得三時之名，不了其意。	The ancients only obtained the names of the three periods, but did not understand their meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c25_14']	今為五時，加於探領法身之化，尚恐不了四聖之情，但作一往等名焉消此品？	今為五時，加於探領法身之化，尚恐不了四聖之情，但作一往等名焉消此品？	Now, for the five periods, adding the teaching of the Dharma-body that is probed, I am still afraid that they will not understand the feelings of the four sages, but only make the names of the first and so forth to explain this chapter?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0274c26_5']	故須引破方識正理。	故須引破方識正理。	Therefore, it is necessary to cite refutations in order to recognize the correct principle.

The various explanations are scattered and disordered, and cannot be relied upon.

['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a03_11']	次正別破中，初兩句縱而破之，乃許第二第三一往，故以其一往而破初師及第五師。	次正別破中，初兩句縱而破之，乃許第二第三一往，故以其一往而破初師及第五師。	Next, in the correct refutation, the first two sentences are a concession while refuting, which allows the second and third to be one-sided, so using their one-sidedness to refute the first teacher and the fifth teacher.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a04_15']	次「若法華」下復以第五師一往對第二一往而為例並。	次「若法華」下復以第五師一往對第二一往而為例並。	Next, If the Lotus Sūtra and below, again using the fifth teacher's provisional to correspond with the second teacher's provisional, to make a parallel.

['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a06_17']	次「若一破一不破」下立例。	次「若一破一不破」下立例。	Next, If one refutes and one does not refute and below, establishing a parallel.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a09_1']	次「又父子」下單破初師畢竟，遙見其父即名相見，名畢竟者，華嚴教時已應得記，則法華無用。	次「又父子」下單破初師畢竟，遙見其父即名相見，名畢竟者，華嚴教時已應得記，則法華無用。	Next, If father and son and below, solely refuting the first teacher's ultimate, seeing the father from afar is called seeing each other, called ultimate means that at the time of the Huayan teaching one should have received the prediction, then the Lotus Sūtra would be useless.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a10_12']	「若後畢竟」下倒並，若後是者前無復用，若無復用昔日聞大結緣不成。	「若後畢竟」下倒並，若後是者前無復用，若無復用昔日聞大結緣不成。	If the latter is ultimate and below, inverting the parallel, if the latter is so, the former has no further use, if there is no further use, then hearing the great teaching in the past does not constitute the formation of the causal connection.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a11_16']	又若第二三四師所立畢竟皆在法華，意則可爾。	又若第二三四師所立畢竟皆在法華，意則可爾。	Moreover, if the ultimate established by the second, third, and fourth teachers is all in the Lotus Sūtra, the meaning may be so.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a14_3']	一往隨逐近遠難依，第五師一往既同前破，隨逐畢竟非釋《法華》，豈有現在一化必令至於金剛？	一往隨逐近遠難依，第五師一往既同前破，隨逐畢竟非釋《法華》，豈有現在一化必令至於金剛？	Following from the beginning to the end is difficult to rely on. The fifth teacher's following from the beginning is the same as the previous refutation. Following to the end is not an explanation of the Lotus Sutra. How can it be said that the present one teaching must reach the adamantine [stage]?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a14_16']	第四師章安無破，但是略耳。	第四師章安無破，但是略耳。	The fourth teacher's chapter has no refutation by Zhanran, it is just a brief mention.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a16_2']	其云一往在於轉教，則轉教已前向非一往，為何所名？	其云一往在於轉教，則轉教已前向非一往，為何所名？	His statement that following from the beginning is in the turning of the teaching, then before the turning of the teaching, is it not following from the beginning? What would it be called?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a17_9']	以得悟為畢竟，五品六根復非一往及以隨逐，為名何等？	以得悟為畢竟，五品六根復非一往及以隨逐，為名何等？	Taking enlightenment as the end, the five ranks and six faculties are also not following from the beginning, what would they be called?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a20_4']	然諸師畢竟皆不破者，前四及第五多分皆至法華，云至佛果，縱有小失而無大過，但不可定以金剛心為畢竟耳。	然諸師畢竟皆不破者，前四及第五多分皆至法華，云至佛果，縱有小失而無大過，但不可定以金剛心為畢竟耳。	However, the teachers who are finally not refuted, the first four and the fifth, mostly all reach the Lotus Sutra. Saying they reach the fruit of Buddhahood, although there are minor faults, there is no great error. It is just that one cannot definitely take the adamantine mind as the end.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a22_13']	今師意者，一往等言待至下根論宿世時方可商度，以人天乘及以說大在往昔故，往昔已後皆名隨逐。	今師意者，一往等言待至下根論宿世時方可商度，以人天乘及以說大在往昔故，往昔已後皆名隨逐。	Now, the master's intention is that the words for the time being will be discussed later when discussing the past lives of those of the lower capacity, because the teachings of the human and heavenly vehicles and the great vehicle were given in the past, and everything after that is called following.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a23_11']	如何二三四師以今世三味而為隨逐？	如何二三四師以今世三味而為隨逐？	How can the second, third, and fourth masters take the three flavors of this present world as following?

If this is pointed to as the traces, it should already be the main gate of moving the attachment;
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a26_1']	若預說後品，乃是此中成顯本竟。	若預說後品，乃是此中成顯本竟。	If it is preemptively explained as the later chapter, then it is the accomplishment and manifestation of the original in this section.

['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a28_3']	「今釋品者」下，今意且論中根信解，故先以三周之初十義中五而判其意。	「今釋品者」下，今意且論中根信解，故先以三周之初十義中五而判其意。	Below Now, the interpretation of the chapter, the present meaning is to discuss the faith and understanding of those of the middle capacity, so first, the five out of the ten meanings at the beginning of the three periods are used to determine the meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a28_14']	夫根有利鈍，即前轉根。	夫根有利鈍，即前轉根。	The capacities of people are sharp or dull, which is the same as the previous turning the capacities.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275a29_10']	不轉根感有厚薄，即前惑有厚薄。	不轉根感有厚薄，即前惑有厚薄。	The responses of not turning the capacities have thickness, which is the same as the previous the delusions have thickness.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b01_1']	說有法、譬，即前通別。	說有法、譬，即前通別。	There are teachings and parables, which is the same as the previous general and specific.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b02_3']	悟有前後，即前悟不悟及悟有淺深，餘意非正。	悟有前後，即前悟不悟及悟有淺深，餘意非正。	As for awakening has a sequence, it means that there is a sequence in awakening and not awakening, and in the depth of awakening. The other meanings are not the main point.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b03_7']	以是義故，所以三根前後領解，何須於此立一往等？	以是義故，所以三根前後領解，何須於此立一往等？	For this reason, the three capacities understand in sequence. Why is it necessary to establish going once and so on here?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b04_1']	「豌豆」者，若作「剜」，刀剜字耳。	「豌豆」者，若作「剜」，刀剜字耳。	As for beans, if written as to dig out, it is the character for to dig out with a knife.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b05_1']	二乘之人於法華前，如生豌豆鑽刺不入。	二乘之人於法華前，如生豌豆鑽刺不入。	Before the Lotus Sūtra, the two vehicles were like raw beans that could not be pierced by drilling.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b06_3']	「但念空無相願」者，是其當教入無漏門故常思之。	「但念空無相願」者，是其當教入無漏門故常思之。	Only thinking of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness is the gateway to entering the undefiled [truth] in their own teaching, so they always contemplate it.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b08_1']	「歡喜踊躍」等者，文中雖以信等四字用對信解以為為人，此善必藉初歡喜也。	「歡喜踊躍」等者，文中雖以信等四字用對信解以為為人，此善必藉初歡喜也。	As for rejoicing and leaping, although in the text the four characters such as faith are used to correspond to faithful understanding as the aspect of benefiting others, this goodness must rely on initial rejoicing.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b09_10']	況理善生破惡獲證，圓融四悉一時俱得，即分證之第一義也。	況理善生破惡獲證，圓融四悉一時俱得，即分證之第一義也。	Moreover, the goodness of principle arises, the evil is destroyed, and the realization is attained. The four aspects of the perfect truth are simultaneously obtained, which is the foremost truth of partial realization.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b11_17']	餘之三悉當位為名相從云分，故此四悉發必俱時，但以信解對為人便，且別言之，此乃通中之別耳。	餘之三悉當位為名相從云分，故此四悉發必俱時，但以信解對為人便，且別言之，此乃通中之別耳。	The other three are named according to their respective positions and are called divisions. Therefore, these four are necessarily aroused simultaneously, but because faith and understanding correspond to the benefit of others, they are simply spoken of separately. This is only a distinction within the general.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b12_7']	此中何故四悉俱實？	此中何故四悉俱實？	Why are the four in this case all real?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b12_16']	以從聞法得解故也。	以從聞法得解故也。	Because one attains understanding from hearing the Dharma.

Only at the end of the five periods is the present meaning discussed.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b20_11']	次「稟小」下約教釋，此欲約位以釋信解，應具列四教，但總標云「稟小大教」，小即三藏、大須指圓，且略中二，以大小教無不皆立二行二道，故先明小，次「準小」下以大望之，乃分兩字以屬二道，破疑故信、進入名解，信通二道、解唯在修，故云「修道名解」。	次「稟小」下約教釋，此欲約位以釋信解，應具列四教，但總標云「稟小大教」，小即三藏、大須指圓，且略中二，以大小教無不皆立二行二道，故先明小，次「準小」下以大望之，乃分兩字以屬二道，破疑故信、進入名解，信通二道、解唯在修，故云「修道名解」。	Next, below receiving the small, it is explained according to the teachings. This intends to explain faith and understanding according to the stages, and should list the four teachings, but it only generally indicates receiving the teachings of the small and great. Small refers to the Tripiṭaka, and great must refer to the perfect. For now, it is abbreviated into two. Because both the small and great teachings establish two practices and two paths, it first clarifies the small. Next, below according to the small, it is compared to the great. It then divides the two characters and attributes them to the two paths. Because it resolves doubts, it is called faith. Entering is called understanding. Faith is common to the two paths, while understanding is only in cultivation. Therefore, it is said that the path of cultivation is called understanding.

['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275b24_17']	文中不云二住已去但云進入，即從初住必有增進，故諸聲聞聞法已後多入修道，今從聞法增進邊說，故云信解。	文中不云二住已去但云進入，即從初住必有增進，故諸聲聞聞法已後多入修道，今從聞法增進邊說，故云信解。	The text does not say from the second abode onwards, but only advancing, which means that from the initial abode there must be progress. Therefore, after hearing the Dharma, many of the śrāvakas enter the path of cultivation. Now, from the perspective of progress after hearing the Dharma, it is said to be faith and understanding.

If one secretly entered this in the past, it would be completely the path of cultivation. From the perspective of the revealed teaching, faith and understanding are simultaneous.

It is already called the doctrine when it belongs to the mature ghee teaching. When it reaches the time of mature ghee, it secretly becomes the separate person, and it is again called the doctrine.

Not abandoning the small is due to not yet knowing the disclosure of the three. Being self-reliant means the small clinging has not moved, protecting others is being confused about the great norms.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275c17_10']	第二失者，一生斷證，是故自鄙年高，敗種未袪，不任之見仍在。	第二失者，一生斷證，是故自鄙年高，敗種未袪，不任之見仍在。	The second loss: in one lifetime, cutting off and realizing, therefore despising oneself for being old. The view of being unworthy still remains, as the seed of failure has not been removed.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275c18_16']	第三失者，昔迷義旨徒計正位之功，由斯固情大心難發。	第三失者，昔迷義旨徒計正位之功，由斯固情大心難發。	The third loss: formerly confused about the meaning, in vain calculating the merit of the correct position. Due to this firm feeling, the great mind is difficult to arouse.

['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0275c24_14']	「無量珍寶」者，昔般若領教謂為菩薩，豈圖於今全蒙等賜。	「無量珍寶」者，昔般若領教謂為菩薩，豈圖於今全蒙等賜。	Immeasurable precious treasures means that in the past, when he received the teachings of prajñā, he considered himself a bodhisattva, how could he have expected to receive everything equally now?

['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a01_13']	譬文為五，始自相失，即結緣已後終至等賜，即聞譬之時，若合四五秖成四段，故光宅十譬不應今文，故前文云「於四人乖離」，離破光宅、乖斥餘師，餘師雖不離為十譬，對當文相又亦乖張，具如前斥。	譬文為五，始自相失，即結緣已後終至等賜，即聞譬之時，若合四五秖成四段，故光宅十譬不應今文，故前文云「於四人乖離」，離破光宅、乖斥餘師，餘師雖不離為十譬，對當文相又亦乖張，具如前斥。	The parable has five parts, starting from the loss of each other, which is after the formation of the karmic affinity, up to the equal bestowal, which is when hearing the parable. If the fourth and fifth are combined, there are only four sections. Therefore, the ten parables of Guangzhai do not correspond to the present text. Therefore, the previous text says the four people are estranged, separating from Guangzhai and criticizing other teachers. Although other teachers do not separate into ten parables, the corresponding text still has discrepancies, as fully criticized above.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a07_6']	「西方」等者，彌陀、釋迦二佛既殊，豈令彌陀隱珍玩服，乃使釋迦著弊垢衣，狀當釋迦無珍服可隱，彌陀唯勝妙之形，況宿昔緣別化道不同，結緣如生、成熟如養，生養緣異父子不成，珍弊分途著脫殊隔，消經事闕、調熟義乖，當部之文永無斯旨。	「西方」等者，彌陀、釋迦二佛既殊，豈令彌陀隱珍玩服，乃使釋迦著弊垢衣，狀當釋迦無珍服可隱，彌陀唯勝妙之形，況宿昔緣別化道不同，結緣如生、成熟如養，生養緣異父子不成，珍弊分途著脫殊隔，消經事闕、調熟義乖，當部之文永無斯旨。	The West and so on means that since the two Buddhas, Amitâbha and Śākyamuni, are different, how can it be that Amitâbha hides his precious clothes and makes Śākyamuni wear tattered robes? It should be that Śākyamuni has no precious clothes to hide, and Amitâbha only has a sublime form. Moreover, the causes and conditions from the past are different, and the methods of teaching are not the same. The formation of causes and conditions is like birth, and the ripening is like nurturing. The causes and conditions of birth and nurturing are different, and the father and son are not established. The precious and tattered are divided into different paths, and the wearing and taking off are separated. The meaning of subduing and ripening is contrary to the meaning of the sūtra. The text of this chapter has never had this meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a10_18']	「舍那著脫」等者，迷於舍那不動而往，彌陀著弊諸教無文，若論平等意趣，彼此奚嘗自矜，縱他為我身還成我化，我立他像乃助他緣，人不見之，化緣便亂。	「舍那著脫」等者，迷於舍那不動而往，彌陀著弊諸教無文，若論平等意趣，彼此奚嘗自矜，縱他為我身還成我化，我立他像乃助他緣，人不見之，化緣便亂。	Mahāvairocana wearing and taking off and so on means being confused about Mahāvairocana not moving and going. Amitâbha wearing tattered robes is not mentioned in the scriptures. If we discuss the intention of equality, how could they ever be self-congratulatory? Even if others act for me, it still becomes my transformation. I establish others' images and thus assist others' causes and conditions. People do not see this, and the causes and conditions of transformation become chaotic.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a13_17']	故知夫結緣者並約應身，如云我昔曾於二萬億等，況十六王子從始至今，機感相成任運分解，是故不可以彼彌陀為此變換。	故知夫結緣者並約應身，如云我昔曾於二萬億等，況十六王子從始至今，機感相成任運分解，是故不可以彼彌陀為此變換。	Therefore, we know that those who form karmic connections are all based on the responsive body. As it is said, I have once in the past, in the time of the two myriads of koṭis, etc., not to mention the sixteen princes from the beginning until now, the resonance of the faculties and conditions forming together is naturally resolved. Therefore, we cannot use that Amitâbha to change this.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a17_7']	「非結緣己界」等者，本結大緣寂光為土，期心所契法界為機，退大已來機土全失，今流五道望本為他，方便有餘尚非己界，況復五道流轉者耶？	「非結緣己界」等者，本結大緣寂光為土，期心所契法界為機，退大已來機土全失，今流五道望本為他，方便有餘尚非己界，況復五道流轉者耶？	Not the realm of those who have formed karmic connections and so on means that the original great karmic connection takes the quiescent light as the land, and the mind's aspiration accords with the Dharma realm as the faculty. Since retreating from the great [vehicle], the faculty and land are completely lost. Now flowing through the five paths, looking back to the original [realm] is considered other. The remaining expedient [means] is still not one's own realm, let alone those who transmigrate through the five paths?
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a19_5']	今窮子所居現處五濁，且以所住望本為他，自爾已來常在三界，故云「久住」。	今窮子所居現處五濁，且以所住望本為他，自爾已來常在三界，故云「久住」。	Now the dwelling place of the poor son is presently in the five turbidities. Moreover, looking back to the original [realm] from the present dwelling place is considered other. Since then, [he] has always been in the three realms, thus it is said to have stayed for a long time.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a20_12']	「此緣」至「長大」者，機中稍厚且與著名，仍未復初但云「三十」。	「此緣」至「長大」者，機中稍厚且與著名，仍未復初但云「三十」。	This karmic connection to having grown up means that the faculties are slightly thicker and are given a famous name, but [he] still has not returned to the beginning and is only called thirty.

Within birth and death, there is a trigger that can be activated, secretly knocking on the city of the wondrous response of great compassion. The great response is still distant, and the trigger is temporarily facing suffering.
['ZH_T34_1719_07a:0276a27_12']	「一念失子苦」等者，以念子苦思種種門，念令得樂復思一門，雖復雙念二俱未剋，今忽得之從本志說，當宣佛道且云一門。	「一念失子苦」等者，以念子苦思種種門，念令得樂復思一門，雖復雙念二俱未剋，今忽得之從本志說，當宣佛道且云一門。	The suffering of losing a child for a moment and so on, means using the suffering of thinking of the child to consider various methods. Thinking of causing the child to obtain happiness again considers a single method. Although both are considered, neither has yet been accomplished. Now suddenly obtaining it, speaking from the original intention, proclaiming the Buddha's path, and just calling it a single method.

First, abandoning great goodness and entering birth and death, therefore saying should not. The previous explanation of the metaphor has the meaning of entering, which is precisely because of this.

There should be those who understand the meaning and anticipate the father's joy, explaining the second meaning.

Therefore, it is said separately. Bodhisattvas are still like this, and the Buddha realm is forever cut off.

Therefore, the seven categories and the six perfections encompass everything. Therefore, in the Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are taken as the bodhisattva's precious torch dhāraṇī. Its value is like a treasure, its illumination is like a torch, it is the best at dispelling darkness, and it is called dhāraṇī because it possesses all dharmas.

When the trigger is ripe, if one realizes what the father has realized, it is called reaching the father's city. This is the small trigger first knocking on the great response.

How could the ministers and aides not fully understand the potential of the poor son? It is just that in terms of the poor son, the time has not yet come.

The Tathāgata's saving from suffering is originally in the bestowal of joy, and after the children have understood the joy, they know the saving from suffering.
