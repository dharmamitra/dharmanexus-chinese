['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a11_1']	不動種性必無退理，故唯前五容有退義。	不動種性必無退理，故唯前五容有退義。	068	The immovable species definitely has no principle of regression, therefore only the former five have the meaning of regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a12_8']	於中後四有退種性，退法一種無退性理，由此種性最居下故。	於中後四有退種性，退法一種無退性理，由此種性最居下故。	068	Among them, the latter four have the species of regression, the one species of regressing dharma has no principle of regressing species, because this species is the lowest.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a13_7']	五種皆有從果退理，雖俱有退然並非先。	五種皆有從果退理，雖俱有退然並非先。	068	The five all have the principle of regressing from their fruits. Although they both have regression, they are not all former.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a14_17']	謂無學位中，從退法種性修練根行轉成思等，此四皆有退性果義。	謂無學位中，從退法種性修練根行轉成思等，此四皆有退性果義。	068	That is to say, in the state of no-more-training, from the species of regressing dharma, cultivating the practice of sharpening the faculties, transforming into contemplating and so forth, these four all have the meaning of regressing from their species and fruits.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a15_17']	退法種性雖必先得，而是退法，故容退果。	退法種性雖必先得，而是退法，故容退果。	068	Although the type that is subject to regression necessarily first obtains the fruit of arhatship, it is still subject to regression and one may fall away from the fruit.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a17_6']	諸學位中從退法性修練根行轉成思等，及得學果，皆容退失。	諸學位中從退法性修練根行轉成思等，及得學果，皆容退失。	068	In all the states of training, one may fall away from the fruit of arhatship and from the nature of being subject to regression that one previously possessed, and one may also fall away from the nature of being subject to regression that one previously possessed in the state of training and that one has cultivated in order to transform oneself into the type that contemplates death, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a18_17']	諸無學者，先學位中所住種性，彼從此性必無退理，學無學道所成堅故。	諸無學者，先學位中所住種性，彼從此性必無退理，學無學道所成堅故。	068	Those who are beyond training do not fall away from the nature of being subject to regression that they previously possessed in the state of training, because that nature is firm, having been perfected by the paths of training and beyond training.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a20_11', 'ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a21_18']	諸有學者，先凡位中所住種性，彼從此性亦無退理，世出世道所成堅故。🔽二先位中住思等性必無有退此所得果，此性二道所成堅故。	諸有學者，先凡位中所住種性，彼從此性亦無退理，世出世道所成堅故。 二先位中住思等性必無有退此所得果，此性二道所成堅故。	068	Those who are in training do not fall away from the nature of being subject to regression that they previously possessed in the state of the ordinary person, because that nature is firm, having been perfected by the mundane and supramundane paths.🔽Those in the two states of being subject to regression and subject to occasional regression do not fall away from the fruit that they have obtained, because that fruit is firm, having been perfected by the two paths of training and beyond training.🔽Those in the two states of being subject to regression and subject to occasional regression do not fall away from the nature of being subject to occasional regression, etc., that they have obtained, because that nature is firm, having been perfected by the two paths of training and beyond training.

['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a25_15']	若就四果辯退果義，雖五種性皆可退果，而先所得必無有退。	若就四果辯退果義，雖五種性皆可退果，而先所得必無有退。	068	If we discuss the meaning of falling away from the fruit in terms of the four fruits, although the five kinds of natures can all fall away from the fruit, that which has been previously obtained is definitely not subject to falling away.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a28_3']	謂四果中先所得者，即預流等前三隨一，從此先果必無退義，是斷見惑所得果故，聖斷見惑必無退故。	謂四果中先所得者，即預流等前三隨一，從此先果必無退義，是斷見惑所得果故，聖斷見惑必無退故。	068	That is, the one who has previously obtained one of the first three fruits, such as the fruit of a stream-winner, is definitely not subject to falling away from that previous fruit, because that fruit is obtained through the severing of the passions that are to be eliminated by the path of insight, and because the holy one who has eliminated the passions of the path of insight definitely does not fall away.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711a28_12']	何緣見惑聖斷無退？	何緣見惑聖斷無退？	068	Why is it that the holy one does not fall away from the elimination of the passions of the path of insight?
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b02_11']	以彼不緣所執事故，謂見所斷煩惱現行，無不皆由我見勢力，以彼煩惱起我見為根故，由此見惑不緣所執，以所執事都無體故。	以彼不緣所執事故，謂見所斷煩惱現行，無不皆由我見勢力，以彼煩惱起我見為根故，由此見惑不緣所執，以所執事都無體故。	068	Because they do not take as their object the substance that is grasped, that is, the actual, present activity of the passions that are eliminated by the path of insight is all due to the power of the view of the self, because those passions arise with the view of the self as their root. Consequently, the passions of the path of insight do not take as their object the substance that is grasped, because that substance that is grasped is totally devoid of substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b06_6']	然有所緣諦為境故，彼所執事都無種子，於所緣境極乖違故，聖者相續真非我解恒所隨故，雖暫失念而必無容重執是我，以見所斷依我事生，故聖斷已必無退義。	然有所緣諦為境故，彼所執事都無種子，於所緣境極乖違故，聖者相續真非我解恒所隨故，雖暫失念而必無容重執是我，以見所斷依我事生，故聖斷已必無退義。	068	However, since the object of their attachment is the truth as its object, the substance that they grasp does not exist at all, because it is in complete contradiction to the object of its attachment. Because the understanding of nonself in the holy path of insight is always present, even though one may temporarily forget it, one is certainly not able to grasp it again as a self. Because the views that are to be eliminated by the path of insight arise on the basis of the self, once they are eliminated by the holy path of insight, there is no possibility of their regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b09_12']	修所斷惑雖顛倒轉，而非無種有所執事，謂於色等染著憎背，高舉不了行相轉時，於色等中非無少分淨妙怨害高下甚深，故非境中極乖違轉。	修所斷惑雖顛倒轉，而非無種有所執事，謂於色等染著憎背，高舉不了行相轉時，於色等中非無少分淨妙怨害高下甚深，故非境中極乖違轉。	068	Even though the passions to be eliminated by the path of cultivation are inverted, they are not without a substance that is grasped, because when one is attached to form, etc., or hates it, or is proud of it, or is confused about it, there is a small amount of purity, excellence, enmity, harm, pride, or depth in form, etc., and therefore they do not evolve in complete contradiction to their objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b10_13']	由此聖者有時失念，執淨妙等相退起修斷惑。	由此聖者有時失念，執淨妙等相退起修斷惑。	068	Consequently, holy teachings sometimes forget and grasp the characteristics of purity, excellence, etc., and retrogress and generate the passions to be eliminated by the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b12_2']	又見斷惑迷於諦理，執我等相諦理中無，理定可依聖見無退；	又見斷惑迷於諦理，執我等相諦理中無，理定可依聖見無退；	068	Also, the passions to be eliminated by the path of insight are confused about the truth of reality, and the characteristics of the self, etc., that are grasped do not exist in the truth of reality. It is certain that one can rely on the truth of reality, and therefore there is no regression from the holy insight that is based on it.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b13_1']	修所斷惑迷麁事生，事變難依有失念退。	修所斷惑迷麁事生，事變難依有失念退。	068	The passions to be eliminated by cultivation are born from delusion concerning gross objects. When the object changes, it is difficult to rely on it, and there is loss of mindfulness and regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b15_7']	又見斷惑要審慮生，聖審慮時必不起惑，修所斷惑非審慮生，聖失念時容有退義，由此無退先所得果。	又見斷惑要審慮生，聖審慮時必不起惑，修所斷惑非審慮生，聖失念時容有退義，由此無退先所得果。	068	Also, the passions to be eliminated by the path of insight are born from careful consideration, and when the noble one carefully considers, he certainly does not generate passions. The passions to be eliminated by the path of cultivation are not born from careful consideration. When the noble one loses mindfulness, there is the meaning of regression. Consequently, there is no regression from the first fruit that one has obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b16_16']	此中無學退法有三，一增進根、二退住學、三住自位而般涅槃。	此中無學退法有三，一增進根、二退住學、三住自位而般涅槃。	068	Among these, there are three kinds of persons who are apt to regress among those who are post-learners: one who advances faculties, one who regresses and remains a learner, and one who remains in his own state and enters nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b17_15']	思法有四，三如前說，更加一種退住退性。	思法有四，三如前說，更加一種退住退性。	068	There are four kinds of persons who are apt to reflect: three are as explained above, and a fourth is added, one who regresses and remains in the nature of one apt to regress.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b18_13']	餘三如次有五六七，應知後後一一增故。	餘三如次有五六七，應知後後一一增故。	068	The remaining three kinds are, respectively, five, six, and seven, because it should be understood that each one increases by one.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b20_11']	何緣練根成思等者，退彼應果住學位時，住先退性非所退者，得思等道今已捨故。	何緣練根成思等者，退彼應果住學位時，住先退性非所退者，得思等道今已捨故。	068	Why is it that when one who has cultivated his faculties and become one who is apt to reflect, etc., regresses from the status of a post-learner and remains in the state of a learner, he remains in his former nature that is apt to regress and is not one who regresses? Because he has already abandoned the path of one who is apt to reflect, etc., that he had obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b22_9']	豈不學位轉成思等，得應果時，雖捨所得學思等道，而住應果思等種性，此亦應然。	豈不學位轉成思等，得應果時，雖捨所得學思等道，而住應果思等種性，此亦應然。	068	Doesn’t the path of insight of the stage of learning change into the path of insight of the stage of post-learning? When one becomes a post-learner, even though one abandons the path of insight of the stage of learning, one still abides in the species of the path of insight of the stage of post-learning. The same should be true of the species of the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b23_9']	此例不齊，以彼學道攝彼無學道為等流果故。	此例不齊，以彼學道攝彼無學道為等流果故。	068	This example is not the same, because the path of insight of the stage of post-learning subsumes the path of insight of the stage of learning as its outflow.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b25_7']	非無學位所捨思等與此學道為同類因，可能引學思等種性，故應退住先所捨者。	非無學位所捨思等與此學道為同類因，可能引學思等種性，故應退住先所捨者。	068	The path of cultivation of the stage of post-learning that is abandoned is not a similar cause of the path of insight of the stage of learning, and it is not able to attract the species of the path of insight of the stage of learning. Therefore one should remain in the species of the path of insight of the stage of learning that was previously abandoned.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b26_18']	有餘於此別立證因，謂若退住所退種性，得勝種性故，應是進非退。	有餘於此別立證因，謂若退住所退種性，得勝種性故，應是進非退。	068	Other sources establish a proof for this, saying, If one remains in the species of the path of insight of the stage of learning that was previously abandoned, one obtains the superior species of the path of insight of the stage of post-learning. Therefore one should be progressing, not regressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b27_17']	此非證因，若無二義，可有是進非退過故。	此非證因，若無二義，可有是進非退過故。	068	This is not a proof, because if there are not two kinds of paths of insight, there is the error that one is progressing, not regressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b28_15']	然得勝性雖可名進，而起惑故亦名為退。	然得勝性雖可名進，而起惑故亦名為退。	068	However, even though one is progressing because one has obtained a superior species of path, one is also regressing because one has aroused passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711b29_5']	由此彼難於理無失。	由此彼難於理無失。	068	Consequently, the above objection is not valid.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c02_3']	又彼退起障涅槃法，聖欣涅槃過於聖道，設得勝性退涅槃故，但應名退不應名進。	又彼退起障涅槃法，聖欣涅槃過於聖道，設得勝性退涅槃故，但應名退不應名進。	068	Moreover, they generate the dharma of obstruction to nirvana, and the noble ones delight in nirvana more than in the noble path. Even if they attain the superior nature, they regress from nirvana. Therefore, they should only be called regressors and should not be called progressors.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c02_12']	然經主意作如是言：	然經主意作如是言：	068	However, the main point of the sutra is as follows:
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c03_16']	阿羅漢果亦無有退，一來、不還世俗道得容有退義。	阿羅漢果亦無有退，一來、不還世俗道得容有退義。	068	The fruit of arhatship also does not regress. The fruit of once-returning and non-returning, which is attained by the mundane path, may have the meaning of regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c04_1']	引經證言：	引經證言：	068	Citing the sutra as evidence, it says:
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c04_10']	聖慧斷惑名為實斷。	聖慧斷惑名為實斷。	068	The noble wisdom cuts off afflictions, which is called true cutting off.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c05_9']	初後二果但由聖慧斷惑而證，故無退理。	初後二果但由聖慧斷惑而證，故無退理。	068	The first and last two fruits are only realized by the noble wisdom cutting off afflictions, so there is no principle of regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c05_14']	又契經言：	又契經言：	068	Moreover, a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c06_8']	我說有學應不放逸，非阿羅漢。	我說有學應不放逸，非阿羅漢。	068	I say that those still learning should not be negligent, not arhats.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c08_6']	今詳經主非善立宗，應審推徵以世俗道得中二果，為實已拔障彼惑種、為不爾耶？	今詳經主非善立宗，應審推徵以世俗道得中二果，為實已拔障彼惑種、為不爾耶？	068	Now, examining the main point of the sutra is not well established. It should be carefully investigated whether the two middle fruits attained by the mundane path are truly able to uproot the seeds of afflictions that obstruct them or not.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c09_17']	若實已拔而許有退，即阿羅漢退義應成，許治道力已拔惑種而更生故。	若實已拔而許有退，即阿羅漢退義應成，許治道力已拔惑種而更生故。	068	If it is truly able to uproot them but is allowed to have regression, then the meaning of regression of arhats should be established, because it is allowed that the power of the antidote can uproot the seeds of afflictions and then regenerate them.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c10_12']	若不許彼煩惱更生，如何名退？	若不許彼煩惱更生，如何名退？	068	If you do not admit that the passions can arise again, how can you call it falling away?
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c12_1']	若謂所退唯道非斷，理亦不然，如後當顯斷如治道，說可退故。	若謂所退唯道非斷，理亦不然，如後當顯斷如治道，說可退故。	068	If you say that what falls away is only the path and not the passions, this is not reasonable, because, as will be shown later, the passions are eliminated by the path of insight and the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c13_18']	亦不可說欲界惑生，可以上界煩惱為種，勿如自界，欲界亦以彼為因故，界應成一。	亦不可說欲界惑生，可以上界煩惱為種，勿如自界，欲界亦以彼為因故，界應成一。	068	You cannot say that the passions of the realm of desire arise using the passions of the upper two realms as seeds, because, like the passions of the same realm, the passions of the realm of desire also have those two realms as their causes, and in that case the three realms would be one.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c15_2']	若實未拔欲界惑種，得不還果應非不還，如契經言：	若實未拔欲界惑種，得不還果應非不還，如契經言：	068	If the seeds of the passions of the realm of desire are not really eliminated, one who has attained the fruit of nonreturner would not be a nonreturner, because a scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c16_5']	我不見有一結未斷，非由彼結之所繫縛還來此間。	我不見有一結未斷，非由彼結之所繫縛還來此間。	068	I do not see any fetter that is not eliminated by which one is bound and returns here.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c18_5']	若謂有經說有欲結而非彼繫還來此間，如《安隱經》，此亦非理，於辯隨眠品已破彼論故。	若謂有經說有欲結而非彼繫還來此間，如《安隱經》，此亦非理，於辯隨眠品已破彼論故。	068	If you say that there is a scripture that says that there is a passion of the realm of desire that is not a fetter that binds one to that realm and causes one to return there, as in the case of the Sūtra on Peace and Bliss, this is not reasonable, because that scripture has already been refuted in the chapter on latent tendencies.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c19_12']	又無不拔欲界惑種而生上界，辯世俗道能斷惑中已成立故。	又無不拔欲界惑種而生上界，辯世俗道能斷惑中已成立故。	068	Also, there is no one who is born in the upper two realms without eliminating the seeds of the passions of the realm of desire, because this has been established in the discussion of the mundane path that eliminates the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c19_17']	又契經說：	又契經說：	068	A scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c20_12']	若實能斷五下分結，成不還果。	若實能斷五下分結，成不還果。	068	If one can really eliminate the five lower fetters, one will realize the fruit of nonreturner.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c21_10']	如何可言於欲界結有未能拔得不還果？	如何可言於欲界結有未能拔得不還果？	068	How can it be said that one has not yet eliminated the bonds of the realm of desire and realized the fruit of nonreturner?
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c22_9']	故定應許若得彼果必已實斷障彼惑得。	故定應許若得彼果必已實斷障彼惑得。	068	Therefore it must be admitted that if one realizes that fruit, one has certainly really eliminated the bonds and the acquisition of the passions that obstruct it.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c22_19']	若不爾者，斷性不成。	若不爾者，斷性不成。	068	If it were not so, the nature of elimination would not be established.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c23_17']	然我於前已曾具顯，諸沙門果亦斷為性。	然我於前已曾具顯，諸沙門果亦斷為性。	068	We have already explained in detail above that the fruits of the mendicant life are also of the nature of elimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c25_2']	然引經言聖慧斷惑名實斷者，彼未達義，今詳經義：	然引經言聖慧斷惑名實斷者，彼未達義，今詳經義：	068	However, the scripture says that holy wisdom eliminates the passions and is called real elimination. That scripture has not yet penetrated the meaning. Now let us examine the meaning of the scripture.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c26_16']	由現見有以世俗道斷八地惑，後還退失結惡趣生，如嗢達洛迦曷邏摩子等。	由現見有以世俗道斷八地惑，後還退失結惡趣生，如嗢達洛迦曷邏摩子等。	068	It is because there are those who eliminate the passions of the eight stages by means of the worldly path, and later fall away and again bind the evil destinies and are born, like Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa and others.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0711c29_6']	唯無漏慧能離有頂染，離已無有復結後有生，依此故言聖慧斷惑名為實斷，非此為遮世俗道力能斷惑義。	唯無漏慧能離有頂染，離已無有復結後有生，依此故言聖慧斷惑名為實斷，非此為遮世俗道力能斷惑義。	068	Only pure wisdom can eliminate the impurity of the peak of existence. Once eliminated, there is no more binding of later existence. It is based on this that it is said that holy wisdom eliminates the passions and is called real elimination. This is not to deny that the power of the worldly path can eliminate the passions.

There is no one who does not regress from the samādhi of cessation, and who does not manifest the passions of the form realm, who first attains the samādhi of cessation and is then born in the form realm.

['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c10_15']	欲貪隨眠由三處起，一欲貪隨眠未斷遍知故、二順彼纏法正現在前故、三於彼正起非理作意故。	欲貪隨眠由三處起，一欲貪隨眠未斷遍知故、二順彼纏法正現在前故、三於彼正起非理作意故。	068	The latent tendency of desire for sensual pleasure arises from three things: the non-eradication of the latent tendency of desire for sensual pleasure, the presence of objects that stimulate the envelopments of desire for sensual pleasure, and the arising of improper attention with regard to them.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c11_16']	此於退義亦不相違，約煩惱無間生煩惱說故。	此於退義亦不相違，約煩惱無間生煩惱說故。	068	This does not contradict the meaning of falling away, because it is said that defilements arise immediately after defilements.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c12_17']	非唯從煩惱無間煩惱生，如是言義如先已說。	非唯從煩惱無間煩惱生，如是言義如先已說。	068	It is not only defilements that arise immediately after defilements, but the meaning of the words is as explained above.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c14_2']	或起煩惱總有二種，一從非理作意、二從如理作意。	或起煩惱總有二種，一從非理作意、二從如理作意。	068	Or, the arising of defilements is generally of two kinds: one from improper attention and the other from proper attention.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c14_16']	此文且說從非理者，故無有過。	此文且說從非理者，故無有過。	068	This passage only discusses that which arises from improper attention, and therefore there is no error.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c16_3']	不應惑起皆以非理作意為先，勿有無初失善無容生過。	不應惑起皆以非理作意為先，勿有無初失善無容生過。	068	One should not be confused about the fact that all the arising of defilements is preceded by improper attention, lest there be the error of no beginning and the fault of the impossibility of the arising of good.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c17_10']	又煩惱起必有俱生非理作意，煩惱起位即可說為隨眠未斷。	又煩惱起必有俱生非理作意，煩惱起位即可說為隨眠未斷。	068	Moreover, the arising of defilements must be accompanied by the arising of improper attention. The stage of the arising of defilements can then be said to be the non-eradication of the latent tendencies.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c18_19']	此文不說諸煩惱起，必以貪等未斷為先，是故此文非證彼義。	此文不說諸煩惱起，必以貪等未斷為先，是故此文非證彼義。	068	This passage does not say that the arising of the passions must be preceded by the non-elimination of craving, etc., and therefore this passage does not prove the above interpretation.

['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c22_5']	謂煩惱起若因緣具則有此三，然於三中隨有所闕亦有起義。	謂煩惱起若因緣具則有此三，然於三中隨有所闕亦有起義。	068	That is, if the causes and conditions for the arising of the passions are complete, then these three are present. However, even if one of the three is lacking, there is still the meaning of arising.

['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c27_12']	此文意顯煩惱生時，或因力偏增、或境或加行，說由三處而起欲貪。	此文意顯煩惱生時，或因力偏增、或境或加行，說由三處而起欲貪。	068	The meaning of this passage is to show that when afflictions arise, sometimes the power of the cause increases, sometimes the object, sometimes the practice, and it is said that desire and greed arise from these three conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c28_4']	若執要具三，則言應不遍。	若執要具三，則言應不遍。	068	If one insists that all three must be present, then the statement would not be universal.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c29_3']	謂緣自界可說具三，非緣餘法有具三理。	謂緣自界可說具三，非緣餘法有具三理。	068	That is to say, one can say that the three are present when taking one's own realm as an object, but there is no principle of the three being present when taking other dharmas as objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0715c29_12']	故對法文不違退義。	故對法文不違退義。	068	Therefore, the text of the Abhidharma does not contradict the meaning of regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a01_2', 'ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a02_10']	通彼教已，彼立理言：🔽若阿羅漢有令煩惱畢竟不起治道已生，是則不應退起煩惱。	通彼教已，彼立理言： 若阿羅漢有令煩惱畢竟不起治道已生，是則不應退起煩惱。	068	Having explained that treatise, their statement of reasoning is:🔽If an arhat has a method for making afflictions never arise again, and the antidote has already arisen, then he should not regress and give rise to afflictions.

['ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a06_5']	謂我宗許先退法性，智力劣故，雖已斷惑而於諸惑未證不生。	謂我宗許先退法性，智力劣故，雖已斷惑而於諸惑未證不生。	068	That is to say, our school accepts that one who is by nature subject to regression, because his power of knowledge is weak, although he has already eradicated the afflictions, has not yet realized that they will not arise again.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a06_15']	若爾，何緣說名為斷？	若爾，何緣說名為斷？	068	If that is so, then why is it said that he has eradicated them?
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a08_3']	此先已釋，謂與煩惱相違法生斷諸繫得、得離繫得，說名為斷。	此先已釋，謂與煩惱相違法生斷諸繫得、得離繫得，說名為斷。	068	This has already been explained, namely, that when the dharmas that are opposed to the defilements arise, they sever the acquisition of the bonds and obtain the acquisition of separation, which is called severance.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a10_1']	故言斷者，由治道生，拔相續中如種惑得，非要令惑畢竟不生，智力劣者復可生故。	故言斷者，由治道生，拔相續中如種惑得，非要令惑畢竟不生，智力劣者復可生故。	068	Therefore, when it is said that one severs [defilements], it is because the path of the antidote arises and uproots the seeds of the defilements within the life-stream. It is not necessary for the defilements to be forever prevented from arising, because those whose wisdom is weak can still give rise to [defilements].
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a10_19']	然無應果非漏盡失，已得諸漏離繫得故。	然無應果非漏盡失，已得諸漏離繫得故。	068	However, one who is not a perfected being does not lose the destruction of defilements, because one has already obtained the acquisition of separation from the defilements.
['ZH_T29_1562_068:0716a12_8']	既許諸惑斷猶有體，忘失治道退緣現前，煩惱復生，違何正理？	既許諸惑斷猶有體，忘失治道退緣現前，煩惱復生，違何正理？	068	Since it is admitted that even though the defilements are severed, they still have a substance, and one forgets the antidote and the conditions for regression appear, the defilements arise again. What correct principle does this contradict?
