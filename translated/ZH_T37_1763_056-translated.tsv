The first is that since a person without nature can become a heavenly being and a heavenly being can become a person, it is known that there is no nature. The second is that because icchantikas sever their roots of goodness, it is known that they have no buddha-nature. The third is that because there is an initial arousal of the mind, it is known that there is no buddha-nature. The fourth is that because [bodhisattvas] regress, it is known that there is no buddha-nature. The fifth is that the myriad wholesome [activities] are the nature, and apart from wholesomeness there is no nature. The sixth is that because causes have strength and weakness, it is known that there is no nature. The seventh is that because the mind of enlightenment was originally nonexistent but now exists, it is known that there is no buddha-nature. The following extensively answers the seven difficulties, extensively distinguishing the nature of regression and non-regression, and distinguishing the cultivation of the thirty-two marks, etc. Chapter 3 of the Shizihou Pin Bodhisattva Shizihou said:

['ZH_T37_1763_056:0554c23_1']	上答六難，明佛性之理，其義不倫；	上答六難，明佛性之理，其義不倫；	056	Above, in response to the six difficulties, it is clarified that the principle of buddha-nature is not in accord with the meaning;
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0554c24_3']	今師子吼欲成前中道之旨，假為定有定無之難。	今師子吼欲成前中道之旨，假為定有定無之難。	056	Now, Shizi Hou wishes to establish the meaning of the middle way from before, and hypothetically poses the difficulty of definite existence and definite non-existence.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0554c25_10']	如來解釋，不可一向定有，亦不可一向定無，故為中道義也。	如來解釋，不可一向定有，亦不可一向定無，故為中道義也。	056	The Tathāgata's explanation is that it cannot be definitely existent in one direction, nor can it be definitely non-existent in one direction, and therefore it is the meaning of the middle way.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0554c26_5']	初五種執有為難，下七句執無也。	初五種執有為難，下七句執無也。	056	The first five kinds of grasping existence are difficulties, and the following seven phrases grasp non-existence.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0554c26_17']	佛性不內者，即時未有也。	佛性不內者，即時未有也。	056	Buddha-nature is not internal, which means it does not yet exist at that time.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0554c27_9']	非外者，不離因而有果也。	非外者，不離因而有果也。	056	It is not external, which means that the effect exists without being apart from the cause.

['ZH_T37_1763_056:0554c29_9']	第四翻，觀因中無果。	第四翻，觀因中無果。	056	The fourth interpretation is that the cause does not have the effect.

['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a01_9']	非內非外，與因中無果作章門也。	非內非外，與因中無果作章門也。	056	Neither internal nor external is used as a chapter heading for the cause not having the effect.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a02_19']	然非失壞，乃遠為下第五因中立性作章門，內者正因、外者緣因。	然非失壞，乃遠為下第五因中立性作章門，內者正因、外者緣因。	056	However, not lost or destroyed is used as a chapter heading for establishing the nature in the cause below, with the true cause being internal and the conditional cause being external.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a04_6']	明有神識者，皆有避苦求樂之解，始終用不改，故名為內。	明有神識者，皆有避苦求樂之解，始終用不改，故名為內。	056	It is explained that all who have a divine consciousness have the understanding of avoiding suffering and seeking happiness, which is used from beginning to end without changing, so it is called internal.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a05_11']	緣因之善，託外緣而生，有時而有、有時而無，故名為外。	緣因之善，託外緣而生，有時而有、有時而無，故名為外。	056	The good of the conditional cause relies on external conditions to arise, sometimes existing and sometimes not existing, so it is called external.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a06_9']	明此二因之中都無有果，故言非內非外。	明此二因之中都無有果，故言非內非外。	056	It is explained that there is no effect at all within these two causes, so it is said to be neither internal nor external.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a07_13']	因中雖無有果，非無緣正二因，此二因未來必得佛果。	因中雖無有果，非無緣正二因，此二因未來必得佛果。	056	Although there is no effect in the cause, there are not no conditional and true causes. These two causes will definitely attain the effect of Buddhahood in the future.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a09_6']	既將明因中無果，故師子吼取外之謬執，謂因中已有果，如乳中以有酪。	既將明因中無果，故師子吼取外之謬執，謂因中已有果，如乳中以有酪。	056	Since it is about to be explained that the cause does not have the effect, the Lion's Roar takes the erroneous attachment of the external, saying that the cause already has the effect, like milk having curds.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a10_5']	若乳中果有酪，當知眾生身中已有佛也。	若乳中果有酪，當知眾生身中已有佛也。	056	If the fruit exists in the milk, then we should know that the Buddha already exists in the body of sentient beings.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a10_17']	今云何言佛性非內非外耶？	今云何言佛性非內非外耶？	056	Why do you say now that the Buddha-nature is neither internal nor external?
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a11_17']	外道計生因生果故，因中有果，過至於內。	外道計生因生果故，因中有果，過至於內。	056	Non-Buddhists think that the cause of birth produces the effect of birth, so the cause contains the effect, and the error reaches the inside.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a13_1']	義所以無失者，不言乳中已有酪也，但有因故言有。	義所以無失者，不言乳中已有酪也，但有因故言有。	056	The reason why there is no loss in the meaning is that it does not say that the curd already exists in the milk, but only that it exists because there is a cause.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a13_16']	明眾生佛性亦然，非即身中已有。	明眾生佛性亦然，非即身中已有。	056	It is explained that the Buddha-nature of sentient beings is also like this, not that it already exists in the body.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a14_12']	一切種智亦有因，故言有眾生佛性。	一切種智亦有因，故言有眾生佛性。	056	The omniscience also has a cause, so it is said that there is the Buddha-nature of sentient beings.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a15_15']	若無此天然之質為神解之主，終不修因除迷求解；	若無此天然之質為神解之主，終不修因除迷求解；	056	If there were no innate substance as the master of spiritual understanding, one would never cultivate causes, eliminate delusion, and seek understanding;
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a17_10']	正以神明之道異於木石，可得瑩飾，故習解虛衿，斷生死累盡，有萬工現前。	正以神明之道異於木石，可得瑩飾，故習解虛衿，斷生死累盡，有萬工現前。	056	It is precisely because the way of spiritual clarity is different from that of wood and stone, and can be polished, that one cultivates understanding, empties the mind, cuts off the bonds of birth and death, and has myriad practices present.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a19_8']	所以種為一切智，豈得言眾生有此法性為體，使即時有果，如外道所計生因生果耶？	所以種為一切智，豈得言眾生有此法性為體，使即時有果，如外道所計生因生果耶？	056	Therefore, seeds are for the sake of omniscience. How can it be said that sentient beings have this dharma nature as their essence, causing them to immediately have fruits, like the externalist's conception of the cause of birth giving rise to fruits?
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a19_14']	其大意乃爾。	其大意乃爾。	056	The general meaning is just like this.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a19_18']	故下云：	故下云：	056	Therefore, it is said below:
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a20_3']	凡作五執。	凡作五執。	056	In general, five attachments are made.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a21_4']	細而尋之，乃不翅五，要而為據事異便成五別。	細而尋之，乃不翅五，要而為據事異便成五別。	056	If examined in detail, there are no more than five. If the essentials are taken as the basis, the different events immediately form five distinctions.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a21_15']	此第一，直執因中有果。	此第一，直執因中有果。	056	This first one directly grasps that there is a result within the cause.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a21_20']	何以知之？	何以知之？	056	How can this be known?
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a23_9']	眾生生法各有時節，但說時有異，非因中都無，故知乳中有酪也。	眾生生法各有時節，但說時有異，非因中都無，故知乳中有酪也。	056	The birth and arising of sentient beings each have their own time. It is only said that there are differences in time, not that there is absolutely nothing within the cause. Therefore, it is known that there is curd within milk.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a24_2']	佛言：	佛言：	056	The Buddha said:

['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a25_18']	答意非無從生之義，故言有耳。	答意非無從生之義，故言有耳。	056	The meaning of the answer is not the principle of arising from non-existence, so it is said to exist.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a26_3']	僧宗曰：	僧宗曰：	056	Seng Zong said:
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555a26_20']	不言乳已有酪，以果由生，故言有耳。	不言乳已有酪，以果由生，故言有耳。	056	It is not said that milk already has curd, but because the fruit arises from birth, it is said to exist.

['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555b01_2']	難意謂乳酪未始不竝，但出時有前後也。	難意謂乳酪未始不竝，但出時有前後也。	056	The meaning of the question is that milk and curd have never not been together, but there is a sequence in their appearance.
['ZH_T37_1763_056:0555b02_3']	善男子！	善男子！	056	Good man!
