['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716a23_16']	如見斷惑所有解脫必無退理，是無漏道所得果故。	如見斷惑所有解脫必無退理，是無漏道所得果故。	069	The liberation from the afflictions eliminated by the path of seeing is definitely not subject to retrogression, because it is the fruit attained by the pure path.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716a24_14']	有頂地繫修所斷惑所有解脫亦無退理。	有頂地繫修所斷惑所有解脫亦無退理。	069	The liberation from the afflictions eliminated by cultivation that bind the peak of existence is also not subject to retrogression.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716a25_11']	彼說非理，道力異故，前已說故。	彼說非理，道力異故，前已說故。	069	Their explanation is unreasonable, because the power of the path is different, as has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716a28_2']	餘無漏道所得解脫見有退故，謂見修道力用各異，見道位中以一品道斷多品惑，修道位中多品道斷多品惑故。	餘無漏道所得解脫見有退故，謂見修道力用各異，見道位中以一品道斷多品惑，修道位中多品道斷多品惑故。	069	The liberation attained by the other pure paths is subject to retrogression, because the path of seeing and the path of cultivation have different functions. In the stage of the path of seeing, a single type of path eliminates many types of afflictions, while in the stage of the path of cultivation, many types of paths eliminate many types of afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716a29_10']	若謂此異由煩惱力，謂見斷惑依無事轉，修道所斷依有事故。	若謂此異由煩惱力，謂見斷惑依無事轉，修道所斷依有事故。	069	If it is said that this difference is due to the power of the afflictions, that is, the afflictions eliminated by the path of seeing operate without depending on objects, while the afflictions eliminated by the path of cultivation depend on objects,
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b01_8']	此亦不然，以世俗道斷此煩惱亦多品故。	此亦不然，以世俗道斷此煩惱亦多品故。	069	This is also unreasonable, because many categories of this passion are also eliminated by the mundane path.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b02_16']	或復但應以見斷惑依無事故斷無退理，非無漏道所得果故。	或復但應以見斷惑依無事故斷無退理，非無漏道所得果故。	069	Or, it should be said that the passions eliminated by the path of insight are eliminated because they are devoid of objects, and there is no reason for their elimination to retrogress, because they are not the result obtained by the pure path.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b05_13']	若謂異生斷無事惑亦有退故，證知諸聖見斷解脫無有退者，是無漏道所得果故，則不應言以無事故雖多品惑一品道斷。	若謂異生斷無事惑亦有退故，證知諸聖見斷解脫無有退者，是無漏道所得果故，則不應言以無事故雖多品惑一品道斷。	069	If it is claimed that the passions devoid of objects eliminated by ordinary beings also retrogress, and it is known that the holy path does not retrogress, because the liberation of the elimination of the passions by the path of insight is the result obtained by the pure path, then it should not be said that although many categories of passions are eliminated by the path of one category, it is because they are devoid of objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b06_13']	故知由道力異義成，由此見修不應為例。	故知由道力異義成，由此見修不應為例。	069	Therefore we know that the meaning of the power of the path is established as different. Consequently, the paths of insight and cultivation are not to be considered the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b06_18']	又前已說。	又前已說。	069	Also, it was said previously.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b07_3']	前說者何？	前說者何？	069	What was said previously?
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b09_10']	謂見斷生由審察力，修所斷惑由境力起，非諸聖者於所緣中無片依希橫興計度，故見所斷解脫無退。	謂見斷生由審察力，修所斷惑由境力起，非諸聖者於所緣中無片依希橫興計度，故見所斷解脫無退。	069	It was said that the passions eliminated by the path of insight are born from the power of discernment, and the passions eliminated by the path of cultivation are born from the power of the object. Holy listeners do not, in regard to the object, have any attachment to a part of it and suddenly give rise to speculation. Therefore there is no retrogressing from the liberation of the elimination of the passions by the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b11_7']	諸異生類猶未見真，故於所緣容橫計度，雖有已斷下八地中見所斷惑亦容有退；	諸異生類猶未見真，故於所緣容橫計度，雖有已斷下八地中見所斷惑亦容有退；	069	Ordinary beings have not yet seen the truth, and therefore they may falsely imagine with regard to their objects. Although they may have already eliminated the passions that are eliminated by the path of insight in the lower eight stages, they may still retrogress.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b14_4']	聖已見真，於見所斷必無有退，然失念故，於外境中取妙等相便有染著憎背高舉不了行轉，由此道理，修斷解脫聖亦有退。	聖已見真，於見所斷必無有退，然失念故，於外境中取妙等相便有染著憎背高舉不了行轉，由此道理，修斷解脫聖亦有退。	069	However, the saints have seen the truth and are absolutely free from retrogressing in the elimination of the passions by the path of insight. However, because of loss of mindfulness, they may grasp the characteristics of beauty, etc., with regard to external objects and become attached to them, or they may become hostile to them, or become conceited, or become confused. As a result of this, they may retrogress in the elimination of the passions by the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b16_11']	故彼所言，諸異生者，斷無事惑亦有退故，證知諸聖見斷解脫無有退者，是無漏道所得果故，理定不然。	故彼所言，諸異生者，斷無事惑亦有退故，證知諸聖見斷解脫無有退者，是無漏道所得果故，理定不然。	069	Therefore, the above statement that ordinary beings may retrogress from the elimination of the passions that are not associated with the passions is not a proof that the saints do not retrogress from the elimination of the passions by the path of insight, because the result obtained by the pure path is definitely not subject to retrogressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b19_1']	又餘無漏果亦見有退故，謂彼所宗必無聖者煩惱斷果世道所得，以彼論言聖者惑斷是世道果理不成故。	又餘無漏果亦見有退故，謂彼所宗必無聖者煩惱斷果世道所得，以彼論言聖者惑斷是世道果理不成故。	069	Also, because there is retrogressing from other pure results. This means that according to the above theory, the saints do not retrogress from the result of eliminating the passions that is obtained by the worldly path, because the above theory says that the result of eliminating the passions of the saints is not logically the result of the worldly path.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b19_9']	《鄔陀夷經》說：	《鄔陀夷經》說：	069	The Udāyi Sūtra says,
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b20_11']	有聖者先得有頂定，後生色界中，離退上斷無生下義。	有聖者先得有頂定，後生色界中，離退上斷無生下義。	069	There are sages who first attain the concentration of the peak of existence and are later born in the form realm. They do not abandon the upper stages and are not born in the lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b22_2']	彼宗不許聖以世道伏惑，不許聖起靜等行故，聖無觀有為靜等故。	彼宗不許聖以世道伏惑，不許聖起靜等行故，聖無觀有為靜等故。	069	This school does not allow the sages to subdue the passions by means of the worldly path, because they do not allow the sages to arouse the practices of tranquility, etc., because the sages do not contemplate the tranquility, etc., of the conditioned.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b24_8']	非彼宗離見非常等所有聖道能實斷惑，異生斷惑至聖位中必無退理，雙道鎮故，由此但依無漏道斷。	非彼宗離見非常等所有聖道能實斷惑，異生斷惑至聖位中必無退理，雙道鎮故，由此但依無漏道斷。	069	In this school, the holy path that is apart from the view of permanence, etc., cannot truly subdue the passions. When ordinary beings subdue the passions, they certainly do not retrogress to the stage of sages, because the two paths are firmly established. Consequently, they only rely on the path of no outflows to subdue.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b26_6']	經說先得滅受想定，後還退故生色界中，是故極成餘無漏道所得斷果亦有退義。	經說先得滅受想定，後還退故生色界中，是故極成餘無漏道所得斷果亦有退義。	069	The scriptures say that one first attains the concentration of the cessation of conceptualization and sensation and is later born in the form realm due to retrogressing. Therefore, it is definitely established that the fruit of the path of no outflows that is attained also has the meaning of retrogressing.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b27_19']	故彼所言，如見斷惑解脫無退，有頂修斷解脫亦爾，是無漏道所得果故。	故彼所言，如見斷惑解脫無退，有頂修斷解脫亦爾，是無漏道所得果故。	069	Therefore, what they say, namely, that just as there is no retrogressing from the liberation that subdues the passions that are to be eliminated by the path of insight, so it is also with the liberation that subdues the passions that are to be eliminated by cultivation in the peak of existence, because it is the fruit of the path of no outflows,
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b28_4']	理定不然。	理定不然。	069	is definitely not reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b28_13']	上座此中亦作是說：	上座此中亦作是說：	069	The Sthavira here also says:
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716b29_5']	定無阿羅漢退阿羅漢果。	定無阿羅漢退阿羅漢果。	069	There definitely is no retrogressing from the fruit of arhatship of an arhat.

['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c02_3']	謂應果必無非理作意故，阿羅漢後心應生煩惱故。	謂應果必無非理作意故，阿羅漢後心應生煩惱故。	069	It means that a perfected being definitely does not have improper thoughts, and because the final mind of an arhat should not give rise to afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c04_2']	謂若應果安和位中，住等運相許退起惑，如何死時息不調順、諸根擾亂煩惱不生？	謂若應果安和位中，住等運相許退起惑，如何死時息不調順、諸根擾亂煩惱不生？	069	It means that if a perfected being, while dwelling in a state of peace, were to regress and give rise to afflictions while in a state of equanimity, how could the breath not be regulated at the time of death, and how could the faculties not be disturbed and afflictions not arise?
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c04_12']	若煩惱生，應續後有。	若煩惱生，應續後有。	069	If afflictions arise, one should continue to exist.

['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c07_6']	若有苾芻，諸漏已盡成阿羅漢，廣說乃至，能不忘失心解脫性。	若有苾芻，諸漏已盡成阿羅漢，廣說乃至，能不忘失心解脫性。	069	If there is a bhikṣu who has already exhausted the contaminants and become an arhat, and so on, he is able to not forget the nature of liberation of mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c08_14']	設有殊妙眼所識色來現在前，彼於所證心解脫中無勞防護。	設有殊妙眼所識色來現在前，彼於所證心解脫中無勞防護。	069	Even if there is a supremely wonderful form cognizable by the eye that comes and appears before him, he does not need to guard the liberation of mind that he has realized.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c09_6']	《鬪戰喻經》作如是說：	《鬪戰喻經》作如是說：	069	The Sutra of the Parable of the Battle says:
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c10_4']	諸聖弟子住無怖心，彼於爾時魔不能擾。	諸聖弟子住無怖心，彼於爾時魔不能擾。	069	The noble disciples abide in a fearless mind, and at that time Mara cannot disturb them.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c10_15']	《藍薄迦經》亦作是說：	《藍薄迦經》亦作是說：	069	The Lanboka Sutra also says:
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c11_12']	若漏已盡成阿羅漢，行住坐臥無不安隱。	若漏已盡成阿羅漢，行住坐臥無不安隱。	069	If the defilements are already exhausted and one becomes an arhat, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, there is no discomfort.

['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c14_1']	樂涅槃者，所有非想非非想結爾時皆得永斷遍知。	樂涅槃者，所有非想非非想結爾時皆得永斷遍知。	069	One who delights in nirvana, all the bonds of neither perception nor non-perception at that time can be permanently severed and fully known.

['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c17_6']	若與弟子共相雜住，我說由斯便從先來所證四種增上心所現法樂住隨一有退。	若與弟子共相雜住，我說由斯便從先來所證四種增上心所現法樂住隨一有退。	069	If one lives together with disciples, I say that because of this, one will then regress from the four kinds of supreme minds that one has realized in the present Dharma and abide in bliss.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c19_8']	若由遠離獨處閑居，勇猛精勤無放逸住所得不動心解脫身作證，我決定說無因緣從此退。	若由遠離獨處閑居，勇猛精勤無放逸住所得不動心解脫身作證，我決定說無因緣從此退。	069	If one attains unshakable liberation of mind and liberation through wisdom by means of being far removed from solitude, dwelling in quietude, being vigorous and diligent, and being free from negligence, I definitely say that there is no cause or condition for regression from this.

['ZH_T29_1562_069:0716c28_16']	謂染作意得非理名，彼所立因顯阿羅漢無起染故不生煩惱，以無煩惱名阿羅漢。	謂染作意得非理名，彼所立因顯阿羅漢無起染故不生煩惱，以無煩惱名阿羅漢。	069	That is to say, defiled attention is called unreasonable attention. The reason they give shows that an arhat does not give rise to defilement and therefore does not generate the passions, because he is without passions and is called an arhat.

['ZH_T29_1562_069:0717a10_7']	趣無餘依般涅槃故，背諸生死流轉事故，一向處中任運轉故。	趣無餘依般涅槃故，背諸生死流轉事故，一向處中任運轉故。	069	Because it leads to parinirvāṇa without remainder, because it turns its back on all the transmigrations of birth and death, and because it proceeds spontaneously, remaining in a state of equilibrium.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0717a11_6']	若於此位起煩惱者，應障諸蘊畢竟斷滅；	若於此位起煩惱者，應障諸蘊畢竟斷滅；	069	If one generates afflictions in this state, then it would obstruct the final cessation of the aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1562_069:0717a12_5']	故阿羅漢死有位中，決定無能退起煩惱。	故阿羅漢死有位中，決定無能退起煩惱。	069	Therefore, in the state of death existence of an arhat, there is definitely no ability to retrogress and generate afflictions.

Next it is said that sometimes they lose mindfulness and give rise to afflictions. Next it is said that they quickly return to being free from them. Later it is said that when they are practicing and dwelling, kings, etc., invite them, but they do not accept wealth and status. Because they have long been in accordance with detachment, etc., it is said that they have been able to permanently spit out the dharmas that accord with the outflows and have attained coolness.

This then manifests that they have already realized the fruit of arhatship.
