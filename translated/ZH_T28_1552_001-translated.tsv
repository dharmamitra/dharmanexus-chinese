Therefore, the previous observation of the consciousness aggregate observes consciousness. When afflictions are thinned, the conception of dharmas arises. When the conception of dharmas arises, then the craving for experience does not arise. Because craving for experience does not arise, one observes form. Therefore, form aggregates are explained first, up to the consciousness aggregate.
