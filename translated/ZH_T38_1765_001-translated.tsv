The principle of not new and not old is precisely the Dharma body. The effect of not old but new is precisely the great prajña. Since there is the perfect completion of the non-old but new wisdom of the species, the old of not old, the suffering and afflictions of ignorance and birth and death, are ultimately extinguished.

Since nirvana with remainder is not yet ultimate, it can only be called extinction. Only when one permanently avoids [suffering] without remainder can it be called crossing over.
