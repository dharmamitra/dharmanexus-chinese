['ZH_T29_1562_071:0725c24_13']	此四通行有差別者，依地依根建立異故。	此四通行有差別者，依地依根建立異故。	071	There are distinctions among these four kinds of progress, because they are established on the basis of stages and faculties.

['ZH_T29_1562_071:0725c26_12']	謂依根本四靜慮中所生聖道名樂通行，任運轉故，如乘船筏。	謂依根本四靜慮中所生聖道名樂通行，任運轉故，如乘船筏。	071	The holy path born from the four fundamental meditations is called the path of ease, because it proceeds spontaneously, like riding in a boat.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0725c27_9']	任運轉者，由此地中止觀雙行無增減故。	任運轉者，由此地中止觀雙行無增減故。	071	Proceeding spontaneously means that in these stages, calming and insight proceed together without increase or decrease.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0725c28_8']	又此諸地所有等持，攝受五支四支成故。	又此諸地所有等持，攝受五支四支成故。	071	Moreover, the samādhi of these stages is perfected by the inclusion of five and four members.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0725c29_7']	依餘無色未至中間所生聖道名苦通行。	依餘無色未至中間所生聖道名苦通行。	071	The holy path born from the other formless realms, the preliminary, and the intermediate stages is called the path of difficulty,
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a01_15']	雖道非苦苦受相應，艱辛轉故亦名為苦，如依陸路乘馬等行。	雖道非苦苦受相應，艱辛轉故亦名為苦，如依陸路乘馬等行。	071	because although the path is not suffering, it is associated with suffering, and it proceeds with difficulty, like traveling on land by horse.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a02_14']	艱辛轉者，由此地中止觀雖俱而增減故。	艱辛轉者，由此地中止觀雖俱而增減故。	071	Proceeding with difficulty means that in these stages, although calming and insight are both present, they are unequal.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a03_14']	謂無色地觀減止增，未至、中間觀增止減。	謂無色地觀減止增，未至、中間觀增止減。	071	This means that in the formless realms, insight decreases and calming increases, while in the preliminary and intermediate stages, insight increases and calming decreases.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a04_12']	又此諸地所有等持，不攝五支四支成故。	又此諸地所有等持，不攝五支四支成故。	071	Moreover, the samādhi of these stages is not perfected by the inclusion of five and four members.

['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a07_8', 'ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a09_6']	謂有先來都未得定，多起功用方得現前，此既現前為勝加行，根本靜慮易起故樂。🔽靜慮中間同一地攝，異心品滅、異心品生，極為艱辛故亦名苦，譬如以木析木極難。	謂有先來都未得定，多起功用方得現前，此既現前為勝加行，根本靜慮易起故樂。 靜慮中間同一地攝，異心品滅、異心品生，極為艱辛故亦名苦，譬如以木析木極難。	071	That is, one who has never previously obtained concentration must generate much effort before it can appear. Since it is easy to generate the fundamental trance state once it has appeared, it is called pleasure.🔽The intermediate trance state is categorized as being on the same level as the fundamental trance state. The cessation of a class of mind is followed by the arising of a different class of mind, and this is extremely difficult, and therefore it is called suffering. It is like the difficulty of splitting wood with wood.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a11_14']	謂一地中有尋有伺，麁心品滅無尋唯伺，細心品生多用功力，諸無色定亦甚難成，故亦名苦，極微細故。	謂一地中有尋有伺，麁心品滅無尋唯伺，細心品生多用功力，諸無色定亦甚難成，故亦名苦，極微細故。	071	That is, in one level of trance there is coarse mind with applied thought and sustained thought, and the cessation of this coarse mind is followed by the arising of a subtle mind without applied thought but with sustained thought only, and this requires much effort. The formless concentrations are also extremely difficult to accomplish and are therefore called suffering, because they are extremely subtle.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a12_13']	謂無色定行相眇然，不易測量、修難成辦。	謂無色定行相眇然，不易測量、修難成辦。	071	That is, the mode of activity of the formless concentrations is so slight that it is difficult to measure, and it is difficult to accomplish them in cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a14_1']	又從靜慮起無色時，五蘊定滅、四蘊定起，極為難辦，故立苦名。	又從靜慮起無色時，五蘊定滅、四蘊定起，極為難辦，故立苦名。	071	Also, when one arises from the trance states and enters the formless states, the five aggregates of the trance states definitely cease and the four aggregates of the formless states definitely arise, and this is extremely difficult to accomplish, and therefore they are called suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a14_10']	云何依根建立差別？	云何依根建立差別？	071	How are the differences established on the basis of faculties?
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a15_9']	謂即苦樂二通行中，鈍根名遲、利根名速。	謂即苦樂二通行中，鈍根名遲、利根名速。	071	That is, in the two paths of slow and quick progress, the dull faculties are called slow, and sharp faculties are called quick.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a16_8']	二行於境通達稽遲說名遲通，翻此名速。	二行於境通達稽遲說名遲通，翻此名速。	071	The two paths are said to be slow and quick in penetrating their objects, respectively.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a17_7']	或遲鈍者所起通行名遲通行，速此相違。	或遲鈍者所起通行名遲通行，速此相違。	071	Or, the path of slow progress is that produced by the dull, and the path of quick progress is the opposite.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a18_6']	或趣涅槃有遲有速由根鈍利，如後當辯。	或趣涅槃有遲有速由根鈍利，如後當辯。	071	Or, there is slow and quick progress toward nirvana due to dull and sharp faculties, as will be discussed later.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a18_15']	此行五蘊四蘊為性？	此行五蘊四蘊為性？	071	Are these paths of slow and quick progress by nature the five aggregates or the four aggregates?
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a19_4']	由依色定、無色定別。	由依色定、無色定別。	071	Because they are supported by the form realm and formless realm, respectively.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a20_12']	而名通者，顯慧勝故，如見道位雖具五蘊，以慧勝故偏立見名。	而名通者，顯慧勝故，如見道位雖具五蘊，以慧勝故偏立見名。	071	But they are called paths because they manifest the superiority of wisdom, just as in the path of insight, although it is endowed with the five aggregates, it is called the path of insight because wisdom is superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a22_1']	如見道邊諸世俗智，金剛喻定亦以五蘊四蘊為體立智定名。	如見道邊諸世俗智，金剛喻定亦以五蘊四蘊為體立智定名。	071	Just as the mundane knowledge on the path of insight and the diamond-like concentration are also called knowledge and concentration because they are by nature the five aggregates and the four aggregates, respectively.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a23_8']	然有經中說四通行五根為性，亦就勝說慧勝中勝故立通名。	然有經中說四通行五根為性，亦就勝說慧勝中勝故立通名。	071	However, there are scriptures that say the paths of slow and quick progress are by nature the five faculties, but this is said with reference to the superiority of wisdom, because wisdom is the most superior among the superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a24_7']	為諸有情無中根者，而今但說遲速行耶？	為諸有情無中根者，而今但說遲速行耶？	071	Are there no beings with middling faculties, and are the paths of slow and quick progress now only spoken of?
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a25_2']	有一類言無中根者，如契經說：	有一類言無中根者，如契經說：	071	One group says there is no medium faculty, as a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a26_9']	諸利根中唯有指鬘最為第一，諸鈍根中唯有蛇奴最為第一。	諸利根中唯有指鬘最為第一，諸鈍根中唯有蛇奴最為第一。	071	Among those with sharp faculties, only Angulimala is foremost, and among those with dull faculties, only Ajnatakaundinya is foremost.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726a27_4']	此經不說別有中根，故知非有。	此經不說別有中根，故知非有。	071	This scripture does not say there is a separate medium faculty, so we know it does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b01_9']	又於三道各說二故，謂見道中唯見說有隨信、法行二道差別，修道位中唯見說有信解、見至二道差別，無學道中唯見說有時及不時二道差別。	又於三道各說二故，謂見道中唯見說有隨信、法行二道差別，修道位中唯見說有信解、見至二道差別，無學道中唯見說有時及不時二道差別。	071	Also, because each of the three paths is said to have two, that is, in the path of seeing, only two kinds of paths are seen, the path of faith-followers and the path of Dharma-followers, in the path of cultivation, only two kinds of paths are seen, the path of conviction and the path of seeing, and in the path of no-more-learning, only two kinds of paths are seen, the timely and the untimely.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b02_2']	若許有中根，應各說三道。	若許有中根，應各說三道。	071	If a medium faculty is admitted, each should be said to have three paths.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b02_15']	若爾，應與契經相違，如說：	若爾，應與契經相違，如說：	071	If so, it would contradict a scripture, which says:
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b03_12']	有情世間生長，有利、中、鈍三根差別。	有情世間生長，有利、中、鈍三根差別。	071	Sentient beings in the world are born and grow, with differences in sharp, medium, and dull faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b06_7']	此不相違，依佛出世彼有情類，初中後時入道不同作是說故，初入道者如阿若多憍陳那等，後入道者如善賢等，中謂所餘。	此不相違，依佛出世彼有情類，初中後時入道不同作是說故，初入道者如阿若多憍陳那等，後入道者如善賢等，中謂所餘。	071	This is not contradictory, because it is said that sentient beings who enter the path in the beginning, middle, and end are not the same when the Buddha appears in the world. Those who enter the path first are like Aśvajit Kauṇḍinya and others, those who enter the path later are like Subhadra and others, and those in the middle are the rest.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b07_6']	或據有情種解脫分有上中下，故說無違。	或據有情種解脫分有上中下，故說無違。	071	Or it is said that there is no contradiction because sentient beings have superior, middling, and inferior seeds of the part of the path that leads to liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b09_3']	然理定應有中根者，謂隨法行一種性中有大聲聞、獨覺、大覺，不可說彼根品無差。	然理定應有中根者，謂隨法行一種性中有大聲聞、獨覺、大覺，不可說彼根品無差。	071	However, the principle must definitely be that there are those of middling faculties, because there are great śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and great buddhas of one kind of spiritual gene among those who follow the teachings. It cannot be said that they are without differences in the categories of faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b09_19']	又契經中說隨法行是鈍根攝，如說：	又契經中說隨法行是鈍根攝，如說：	071	Moreover, a scripture says that those who follow the teachings are included among those of dull faculties. As it is said:
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b11_1']	五根增上猛利極圓滿者名俱解脫，乃至廣說。	五根增上猛利極圓滿者名俱解脫，乃至廣說。	071	Those whose five faculties are superior, intense, and extremely complete are called liberated through both parts, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b13_7']	然通行中不別說有中品行者，不明了故，於世典中亦隨明了唯見顯示上下非中，由此已釋道唯二意。	然通行中不別說有中品行者，不明了故，於世典中亦隨明了唯見顯示上下非中，由此已釋道唯二意。	071	However, among the common practices, those of middling practice are not specifically mentioned, because they are not clear. In the worldly classics, it is also only seen that the superior and inferior are shown, not the middling, following what is clear. For this reason, it is already explained that the path has only two meanings.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b15_14']	又彼所引《根第一經》已定證成有中根者，謂既說有第一利根，知更有餘利而非極，但對鈍者說之為利；	又彼所引《根第一經》已定證成有中根者，謂既說有第一利根，知更有餘利而非極，但對鈍者說之為利；	071	Also, the first of the faculties scripture that they cite has already been proven to establish the existence of an intermediate faculty. It says that there is a first, or highest, faculty, and we know that there are other superior faculties that are not the highest. It only says that they are superior in comparison with the dull.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b18_2']	又既說有第一鈍根，知更有餘鈍而非極，但對利者說之為鈍，故應決定許有中根，經中明說有三根故。	又既說有第一鈍根，知更有餘鈍而非極，但對利者說之為鈍，故應決定許有中根，經中明說有三根故。	071	Also, it says that there is a first, or lowest, faculty, and we know that there are other inferior faculties that are not the lowest. It only says that they are inferior in comparison with the superior. Therefore we must definitely admit that there is an intermediate faculty, because the scripture clearly speaks of three faculties.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b19_1']	依根立道必亦有三，但不分明，故唯說二。	依根立道必亦有三，但不分明，故唯說二。	071	The path established on the basis of the faculties must also be of three kinds, but it is not clear, and therefore the scripture only speaks of two.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b20_17']	然中根性攝在二中，以利鈍中有非極故，應知通行隨此相說，唯立遲速無別處中。	然中根性攝在二中，以利鈍中有非極故，應知通行隨此相說，唯立遲速無別處中。	071	However, the nature of the intermediate faculty is included in the two, because there is an intermediate faculty that is not extreme in the dull and sharp. You must understand that the two kinds of progress are spoken of in accordance with this characteristic, and there is only slow and fast, with no middle ground.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b22_6']	然上所言由根利鈍於趣圓寂有速有遲，此據等修勤加行說；	然上所言由根利鈍於趣圓寂有速有遲，此據等修勤加行說；	071	However, the above statement that the saintly path is slow or fast in arriving at nirvana due to the dullness or sharpness of the faculties refers to the case where there is equal cultivation and effort in practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b23_5']	若不據等，則鈍利根趣向涅槃遲速不定。	若不據等，則鈍利根趣向涅槃遲速不定。	071	If we do not refer to equality, then the speed of arrival at nirvana of those with dull and sharp faculties is not fixed.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b26_4']	又契經說有現法遲身壞速等四句差別，此約加行有勤不勤，不約轉根及有退說，以諸聖者若已經生，不退不轉根不生上界故。	又契經說有現法遲身壞速等四句差別，此約加行有勤不勤，不約轉根及有退說，以諸聖者若已經生，不退不轉根不生上界故。	071	Also, a scripture says that there are four alternatives of the present life: slow in body and quick in thought, etc. This is based on the difference of effort in practice, and not on the change of faculties or on retrogression, because the saints, once they have been born, do not retrogress, do not change faculties, and are not born in a higher realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b27_5']	大覺、獨覺到究竟聲聞，依何通行入聖證極果？	大覺、獨覺到究竟聲聞，依何通行入聖證極果？	071	What kinds of practices do the Great Awakened One, the Solitary Awakened One, and the perfected disciple rely on to enter the holy path and realize the ultimate fruit?
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726b29_3']	大覺唯依樂速通行，謂以第四靜慮為依，由極利根入正決定，證得無上正等菩提。	大覺唯依樂速通行，謂以第四靜慮為依，由極利根入正決定，證得無上正等菩提。	071	The Great Awakened One relies only on the practice of pleasure and speed, that is, taking the fourth trance state as the basis. Due to extremely sharp faculties, he enters right determination and realizes unsurpassed perfect supreme enlightenment.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726c01_2']	於獨覺中麟角喻者，如大覺說，餘則不定。	於獨覺中麟角喻者，如大覺說，餘則不定。	071	As for the Solitary Awakened One, the one who is like a rhinoceros enters as explained for the Great Awakened One. The others are not fixed.
['ZH_T29_1562_071:0726c03_11']	於到究竟二聲聞中，舍利子依苦速通行及樂速通行入聖證極果，彼依未至入正決定，依第四定得漏盡故；	於到究竟二聲聞中，舍利子依苦速通行及樂速通行入聖證極果，彼依未至入正決定，依第四定得漏盡故；	071	As for the two perfected disciples, Śāriputra relies on the practice of suffering and speed and the practice of pleasure and speed to enter the holy path and realize the ultimate fruit.
