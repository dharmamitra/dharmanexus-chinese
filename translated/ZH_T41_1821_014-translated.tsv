If one receives the precepts of a lower level after receiving the precepts of a higher level, does one obtain the precepts or not? The Thirty-Six of the Correct Principles says:
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c12_1']	若有勤策受近事律儀。	若有勤策受近事律儀。	If there is a novice monk who receives the precepts of a lay practitioner,
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c12_15']	或有苾芻受前二種戒為受得不。	或有苾芻受前二種戒為受得不。	or if there is a fully ordained monk who receives the precepts of the two lower levels, does he obtain the precepts or not?
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c13_6']	有作是言此不應責。	有作是言此不應責。	Some say this should not be questioned.
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c13_16']	若先已有無更受得理。	若先已有無更受得理。	If one already has [the precepts], there is no further obtaining of the precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c14_3']	先已得故。	先已得故。	Because one has already obtained [the precepts].
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c14_12']	若先未有則非勤策。	若先未有則非勤策。	If one did not have [the precepts] before, then one is not a novice monk,
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c15_15']	亦非苾芻以先不受近事律儀必無受得勤策戒理。	亦非苾芻以先不受近事律儀必無受得勤策戒理。	and also not a fully ordained monk, because without first receiving the precepts of a lay practitioner, there is no principle of obtaining the precepts of a novice monk.
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c16_15']	若先不受勤策律儀亦無受得苾芻戒理。	若先不受勤策律儀亦無受得苾芻戒理。	If one does not first receive the precepts of a novice monk, there is also no principle of obtaining the precepts of a fully ordained monk.
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c17_7']	是即不可立彼二名。	是即不可立彼二名。	This cannot be established as the names of those two.

['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c17_17']	受應不得。	受應不得。	it should be said that one does not obtain [the precepts].
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c19_2']	有餘師說不受前律儀亦有即能受得後戒理。	有餘師說不受前律儀亦有即能受得後戒理。	Other masters say that one who has not previously received the precepts of the śrāmaṇera can receive the precepts of the bhikṣu.
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c20_3']	故持律者作是誦言雖於先時不受勤策戒。	故持律者作是誦言雖於先時不受勤策戒。	Therefore the Vinaya masters recite the following: “Even though one has not previously received the śrāmaṇera precepts,
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c21_3']	而今但受具足律儀者亦名善受具足律儀。	而今但受具足律儀者亦名善受具足律儀。	if one now receives only the precepts of the bhikṣu, this is called receiving well the precepts of the bhikṣu.”

['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c23_11']	豈不勤策不應自稱唯願證知我是近事。	豈不勤策不應自稱唯願證知我是近事。	Is it not the case that the śrāmaṇera should not call himself by the name of the upāsaka?
['ZH_T41_1821_014:0218c23_16']	苾芻亦爾。	苾芻亦爾。	The bhikṣu is the same.

Moreover, the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā, fascicle 122, clarifies the existence of one who possesses present bodily avijñapti but not its vijñapti. There are also two explanations in it.

['ZH_T41_1821_014:0223b14_2']	後師意說欲界亦有無表離表而生。	後師意說欲界亦有無表離表而生。	The latter master's meaning is that in the desire realm, there is also unmanifest action that arises apart from manifest action.
