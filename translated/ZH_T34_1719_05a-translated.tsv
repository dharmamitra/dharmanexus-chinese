Therefore, the current explanation of the meaning cannot be universally understood.

Therefore, this explanation says that the three vehicles are not only bodhisattvas. Therefore, bodhisattvas are combined with the two vehicles to explain, which is the same as the Dharma body of the three vehicles being the same as the Buddha.

Next, this realm is shown to be the same for all. Next, it makes them realize the same existence. Next, it makes them enter this realm, therefore it is called non-retrogression.

Therefore, the text of the treatise does not distinguish the fixed nature, let alone the treatise saying the unripe will soon ripen.

Therefore, it is known that before that, the doubts are not real. Doubts are common to the general and specific principles, which should not be so. If they are not met with, how can they know the suchness of reality? Moreover, knowing the suchness of reality still requires cultivation.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235a18_4']	釋悟中云「未發心令發菩提心」，若不發心不名菩薩，故知爾前得菩薩名未發圓心。	釋悟中云「未發心令發菩提心」，若不發心不名菩薩，故知爾前得菩薩名未發圓心。	In the explanation of enlightenment, it says causing those who have not given rise to the mind to give rise to the bodhi mind. If one has not given rise to the mind, it is not called bodhisattva. Therefore, it is known that before that, one obtains the name of bodhisattva but has not given rise to the perfect mind.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235a21_1']	釋入中云「已發心者令入法故」，故未發者或指藏通，已發之言多指別教，別教知中雖似已發，不入證道故須令入。	釋入中云「已發心者令入法故」，故未發者或指藏通，已發之言多指別教，別教知中雖似已發，不入證道故須令入。	The commentary on entering says, In order to cause those who have already given rise to the mind to enter the Dharma, therefore those who have not yet given rise to the mind may refer to the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings. The phrase have already given rise to the mind mostly refers to the Distinct Teaching. Although those in the Distinct Teaching who know the Middle Way seem to have already given rise to the mind, they still need to be caused to enter because they have not yet entered the path of realization.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235a23_14']	佛知見言正簡於權，當知三教菩薩有疑未發，未入真常，所以《論》文現令菩薩開示悟入，而苦不許公違《論》文。	佛知見言正簡於權，當知三教菩薩有疑未發，未入真常，所以《論》文現令菩薩開示悟入，而苦不許公違《論》文。	The words Buddha's knowledge and insight specifically distinguish from the provisional. One should know that the bodhisattvas of the three teachings have doubts and have not yet given rise to the mind, and have not yet entered the eternal and constant. Therefore, the treatise text clearly causes the bodhisattvas to reveal, understand, and enter, but it is painful not to allow openly contradicting the treatise text.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235a25_6']	第三約凡夫釋中《論》亦不釋開句，今亦指同初文，故知凡夫與三乘同。	第三約凡夫釋中《論》亦不釋開句，今亦指同初文，故知凡夫與三乘同。	In the third explanation using ordinary beings, the treatise also does not explain the phrase revealing. Now it is also pointed out as the same as the first text, therefore it is known that ordinary beings are the same as the three vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235a26_7']	第二句雖釋，其言全與初二乘中第二句同。	第二句雖釋，其言全與初二乘中第二句同。	Although the second phrase is explained, its words are completely the same as the second phrase in the first two vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235a27_15']	至第三句方異前二釋，故知凡夫與三乘人同，有法身佛性。	至第三句方異前二釋，故知凡夫與三乘人同，有法身佛性。	Only in the third phrase is it different from the previous two explanations, therefore it is known that ordinary beings and the people of the three vehicles are the same in having the Dharma body and Buddha-nature.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235a29_8']	故下二句凡夫與三乘別者，以外道計常故，一切眾生未知菩提故。	故下二句凡夫與三乘別者，以外道計常故，一切眾生未知菩提故。	Therefore, the last two sentences distinguish ordinary beings from the Three Vehicles, because non-Buddhists cling to permanence, and all sentient beings do not yet know bodhi.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235b02_8']	既為凡夫別一番釋，故知不得深位釋之，故釋悟句云「令覺悟」，入句「令入菩提」。	既為凡夫別一番釋，故知不得深位釋之，故釋悟句云「令覺悟」，入句「令入菩提」。	Since they are distinguished as ordinary beings in a separate section, we know that they cannot be explained as being of a deep stage. Therefore, in explaining the phrase enlightenment, it says to cause them to awaken, and in the phrase to enter, it says to enter bodhi.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235b04_3']	當知凡夫不知不覺有無上法，亦未曾發菩提之心，而皆云與三乘同也。	當知凡夫不知不覺有無上法，亦未曾發菩提之心，而皆云與三乘同也。	We should know that ordinary beings do not know or realize the unsurpassed Dharma, and have never given rise to the mind of bodhi, yet it is said that they are the same as the Three Vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235b05_2']	故知三番人異義同，是故初句皆可義同。	故知三番人異義同，是故初句皆可義同。	Therefore, we know that the three types of people are different but the meaning is the same. For this reason, the first phrase can all be understood to have the same meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235b06_14']	次釋菩薩第二句中云「令知如實」，如實秖是法身異名，此亦言異義同。	次釋菩薩第二句中云「令知如實」，如實秖是法身異名，此亦言異義同。	Next, in explaining the second phrase about bodhisattvas, it says to cause them to know as it is. As it is is just another name for the Dharma body. This also means that the words are different but the meaning is the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235b09_8']	第三句對二乘不知，故云「令知」，對菩薩已曾發心，令更發心，對凡夫令異外道，亦令外道悟故，此則義異意同。	第三句對二乘不知，故云「令知」，對菩薩已曾發心，令更發心，對凡夫令異外道，亦令外道悟故，此則義異意同。	The third phrase is for the two vehicles who do not know, so it says to make them know. It is for bodhisattvas who have already given rise to the aspiration to give rise to the aspiration again. It is for ordinary beings to be different from non-Buddhists, and also to make non-Buddhists awaken. This then has different meanings but the same intention.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235b13_12']	第四句中對二乘退大云「不退」，對菩薩已發未入故云「入法」，對凡夫未曾發故，直云「大道」，當知秖是一佛知見，為令此等人異開同，故知舉三乘及以凡夫，收機罄盡，咸曰眾生。	第四句中對二乘退大云「不退」，對菩薩已發未入故云「入法」，對凡夫未曾發故，直云「大道」，當知秖是一佛知見，為令此等人異開同，故知舉三乘及以凡夫，收機罄盡，咸曰眾生。	In the fourth phrase, it is for the two vehicles who have regressed from the Great Vehicle, so it says non-retrogression. It is for bodhisattvas who have already given rise to the aspiration but have not yet entered, so it says to enter the Dharma. It is for ordinary beings who have not yet given rise to the aspiration, so it simply says the great path. One should know that it is only the Buddha's knowledge and vision, in order to make these people different and the same. Therefore, one should know that mentioning the three vehicles and ordinary beings completely includes all capacities, and they are all called sentient beings.

Now, in the first explanation, it is separated into four, thus forming three rounds, each with four explanations. But it only mentions the two vehicles as an example for the rest, and it is also taking the difficult to illustrate the easy, because the two vehicles are difficult.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235b21_21']	今初釋者先屬對《論》文，初以證不退為四位釋者，即《論》第四句，既云不退，即開示悟入皆念不退。	今初釋者先屬對《論》文，初以證不退為四位釋者，即《論》第四句，既云不退，即開示悟入皆念不退。	In the first explanation, first correspond to the treatise text. The first uses the proof of non-retrogression as the explanation for the four stages. This is the fourth phrase in the treatise. Since it says non-retrogression, then the opening, revealing, understanding, and entering are all thoughts of non-retrogression.

Relying on the profound sequence is one approach. The six cannot be transcended. The sutra text is clear. Initially, it says not by thought and so on, which corresponds to the oneness of principle, because it is what is thought.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235c25_9']	唯有諸佛等對智一者，能知故也。	唯有諸佛等對智一者，能知故也。	Only the buddhas and so on correspond to the oneness of wisdom, because it is what is known.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0235c27_13']	唯以等文義既具三，理須分別，文雖具三語意在於一大家事，事即因果故云義便，乃為行一。	唯以等文義既具三，理須分別，文雖具三語意在於一大家事，事即因果故云義便，乃為行一。	The text of only by has the meaning of the three, so it must be distinguished. Although the text has the three, the meaning of the words is in the one great family matter. The matter is cause and effect, so it is said to be convenient in meaning, which is the oneness of practice.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a01_5']	又智能照境方達境大，故大名智，以事為行，有其二意，自行化他俱名事故，今化他故是佛出世之大事也。	又智能照境方達境大，故大名智，以事為行，有其二意，自行化他俱名事故，今化他故是佛出世之大事也。	Moreover, wisdom can illuminate the realm in order to reach the greatness of the realm, so greatness is called wisdom. Taking the matter as practice has two meanings. One's own practice and transforming others are both called matters, so now transforming others is the great matter of the buddhas appearing in the world.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a03_6']	應知初分別釋用前分字解意，次逐義便用前總釋，前雖二釋總釋易見，故今用之。	應知初分別釋用前分字解意，次逐義便用前總釋，前雖二釋總釋易見，故今用之。	It should be known that the initial analysis uses the previous part of the text to explain the meaning, and then uses the previous general explanation for the sake of the meaning. Although there were two explanations before, the general explanation is easier to see, so it is used now.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a07_11']	次「知見者」下，意取經文從欲令去為位一，文中但云知見者，以經文一一句中皆云知見，即能知見已屬智行，所見諦理已屬理一，雖不分於知見淺深，乃以開等對位各別，故屬位一。	次「知見者」下，意取經文從欲令去為位一，文中但云知見者，以經文一一句中皆云知見，即能知見已屬智行，所見諦理已屬理一，雖不分於知見淺深，乃以開等對位各別，故屬位一。	Next, below the knower and seer, the meaning takes the text from to cause as a stage. In the text, it only says the knower and seer, because in each sentence of the text it says knower and seer, which is the ability to know and see, which belongs to the practice of wisdom. What is seen is the truth, which belongs to the oneness of principle. Although it does not distinguish the shallowness and depth of knowing and seeing, it is distinguished by the stages of opening, etc., so it belongs to the oneness of stages.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a08_19']	次又取結文對三法一，重取前文攬意而說，故云「又」也。	次又取結文對三法一，重取前文攬意而說，故云「又」也。	Next, it takes the concluding text to correspond to the oneness of the three dharmas. It takes the previous text again and explains it with the meaning, so it says again.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a10_13']	「又取」諸句下出現之言，為感應一，四句皆同隨義故別，無非感應，餘四可知。	「又取」諸句下出現之言，為感應一，四句皆同隨義故別，無非感應，餘四可知。	Again, it takes the word appearance in the various sentences below as the oneness of stimulus and response. The four sentences are the same, but the meanings are different. There is no stimulus and response. The other four can be understood.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a12_5']	「經文」等者，明廢立意，雖消文不用、義理非無，是故三中存而用略。	「經文」等者，明廢立意，雖消文不用、義理非無，是故三中存而用略。	The text and so on clarify the intention of abolition and establishment. Although the text is not used, the meaning is not nonexistent. Therefore, among the three, it is retained and used briefly.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a13_7']	從「若略」下欲用舊略，復論去取簡義存數故也。	從「若略」下欲用舊略，復論去取簡義存數故也。	From If it is brief below, wanting to use the old brief, it is discussed again to select and retain the meaning and number.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a13_15']	於中先簡、次存。	於中先簡、次存。	In it, first it is selected, then retained.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a17_3']	初廢果立理，舊以四句同是果一，雖以果為理名不別彰，故須破之而別立理，故依道理無理屬魔，既句句中皆云知見，故所知見豈非理一？	初廢果立理，舊以四句同是果一，雖以果為理名不別彰，故須破之而別立理，故依道理無理屬魔，既句句中皆云知見，故所知見豈非理一？	First, the fruit is abolished and the principle is established. The old four phrases are the same as the one fruit. Although the fruit is used as the principle, the name is not distinguished. Therefore, it must be broken and the principle is established separately. Therefore, according to the principle, there is no principle belonging to the demon. Since it is said in each phrase that it is knowledge and vision, how can the known and seen not be the one principle?
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a20_6']	次廢因立行者，行之始終即是因果，但點行一即收二義，雖廢果稱乃在行終，但加理一為教等本，故使理名通開等四義順故也。	次廢因立行者，行之始終即是因果，但點行一即收二義，雖廢果稱乃在行終，但加理一為教等本，故使理名通開等四義順故也。	Next, the practice is abolished and the practitioner is established. The beginning and end of practice are precisely the cause and effect. But pointing to the one practice includes the two meanings. Although the name of the fruit is abolished, it is in the end of the practice. But adding the one principle is the basis of the teachings, etc., so the name of the principle is the four meanings such as opening, etc. The meaning is in accordance with it.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a20_17']	次「人一」下存其二也。	次「人一」下存其二也。	Next, the one person below retains the two.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a22_11']	次正釋者，先明來意云且「從略」，對十等說故名為略，十等仍存故云且也。	次正釋者，先明來意云且「從略」，對十等說故名為略，十等仍存故云且也。	Next, in the correct explanation, first clarify the intention, saying for now from the brief. Compared to the ten equalities, it is called brief, and the ten equalities still remain, so it is called for now.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a23_7']	先釋理一自為四義，今又為三：	先釋理一自為四義，今又為三：	First, explain the one principle, which is divided into four meanings, now further into three:

['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a29_1']	然此四一準下消文皆有兩向，並從一邊，左右互攝以別四一，故四相望尚各具四，況兩向耶？	然此四一準下消文皆有兩向，並從一邊，左右互攝以別四一，故四相望尚各具四，況兩向耶？	However, according to the following interpretation of the four ones, they all have two directions, both following one side, left and right mutually encompassing to distinguish the four ones, thus the four compared still each have the four, let alone the two directions?
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236a29_4']	何者？	何者？	What is it?
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b02_1']	如所知為理則能知屬智，能稟是人、能詮是教，今文具二故且從理，故云理一。	如所知為理則能知屬智，能稟是人、能詮是教，今文具二故且從理，故云理一。	If what is known is taken as the principle, then the ability to know belongs to wisdom. The one who receives it is the person, and the one who expounds it is the teaching. The present text has both, so it is taken as the principle. Therefore, it is said that the principle is one.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b04_6']	今顯此理，理不獨顯，以智門觀三，歷所涉位共方顯理，乃是却將人教行三，歷位取理觀心人也。	今顯此理，理不獨顯，以智門觀三，歷所涉位共方顯理，乃是却將人教行三，歷位取理觀心人也。	Now, in revealing this principle, the principle is not revealed alone. Using the three of wisdom, gate, and contemplation, one traverses the stages and together reveals the principle. This is then using the three of person, teaching, and practice to traverse the stages and take the principle. Contemplating the mind is the person.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b04_16']	四門教也，四智行也。	四門教也，四智行也。	The four gates are the teaching, and the four wisdoms are the practice.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b05_9']	三種相由破惑入位階於至理。	三種相由破惑入位階於至理。	The three kinds mutually depend on breaking through delusions and entering the stages to reach the ultimate principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b07_14']	若爾，後三相成亦應可爾，是故今初舉所依諦不能自顯，智是能用，由之見理故云「乃能」。	若爾，後三相成亦應可爾，是故今初舉所依諦不能自顯，智是能用，由之見理故云「乃能」。	If so, the latter three aspects can also be established in the same way. Therefore, at the beginning, the dependent truth cannot reveal itself. Wisdom is the function, and through it one sees the principle. Therefore, it is said only then can one.

['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b09_7']	雖體相即顯勝須分。	雖體相即顯勝須分。	Although the essence and characteristics are mutually inclusive, the superior must be distinguished.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b11_7']	四「經云」下，約位引文釋其所以，眾生義兼佛果唯極，極果知見令物即得，故異前經。	四「經云」下，約位引文釋其所以，眾生義兼佛果唯極，極果知見令物即得，故異前經。	Fourth, below the sutra says, it uses the stage to cite the text and explain the reason. The meaning of sentient beings is shared with the Buddha fruit, which is only ultimate. The ultimate fruit's knowledge and insight allows beings to attain it immediately, therefore it is different from the previous sutra.

['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236b14_14']	自非今見委出妙境，眾生心佛一體無差，豈知眾生有佛知見，故約教判其理宛然。	自非今見委出妙境，眾生心佛一體無差，豈知眾生有佛知見，故約教判其理宛然。	Without the present view thoroughly revealing the wonderful realm, how could one know that sentient beings have the Buddha's knowledge and insight? Therefore, using the teachings to judge the principle is clear.

The common and specific two delusions are the same in one thought. The essence of thought is precisely this essence, which is not principle, and this event is not this. The one suchness of this and that is the obstacle of the same essence. The two delusions cannot be divided, so it is said difficult to understand.

['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236c26_4']	望謂相望，即圓滿時日月相望。	望謂相望，即圓滿時日月相望。	Full means to look at each other, referring to the time when the moon is full and the sun and moon look at each other.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236c27_4']	月非朔望，寄於朔望則有虧盈，合文可見。	月非朔望，寄於朔望則有虧盈，合文可見。	The moon is not the new or full moon, but when it is borrowed for the new and full moon, there is waning and waxing. The combined text can be seen.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236c28_1']	言「云云」者，須引《大經》月愛喻也。	言「云云」者，須引《大經》月愛喻也。	As for and so on, it is necessary to cite the metaphor of the moon's love from the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236c29_2']	次約四智中初辯異者，秖是圓位能契之智。	次約四智中初辯異者，秖是圓位能契之智。	Next, in discussing the four wisdoms, the first is to distinguish them. They are simply the wisdom of the perfect stage that can accord with reality.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0236c29_18']	言「不如」者，不同也，簡異於遍。	言「不如」者，不同也，簡異於遍。	As for not like, it means not the same, distinguishing them from the universal.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a01_10']	彼般若中通三教故，故名為通。	彼般若中通三教故，故名為通。	Because the wisdom in the universal wisdom is common to the three teachings, it is called universal.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a02_12']	今不依之，唯一圓道故云「不如」，如字平呼。	今不依之，唯一圓道故云「不如」，如字平呼。	Now, not relying on it, there is only the perfect way, so it is said to be not like. The character ru is pronounced in a level tone.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a03_16']	次正釋者，先約位中已略明行相，此中重明但直述而已；	次正釋者，先約位中已略明行相，此中重明但直述而已；	Next, in the correct explanation, the characteristics have already been briefly explained in the stage discussion. Here, they are explained again but only stated directly;
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a04_2']	有釋有結。	有釋有結。	there is explanation and conclusion.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a04_6']	釋中二：	釋中二：	In the explanation, there are two parts:

['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a07_7']	初文者，慧因智果各通總別，因果之上各加種者故得別名，各加一切故受果稱。	初文者，慧因智果各通總別，因果之上各加種者故得別名，各加一切故受果稱。	In the initial text, wisdom and cognition, cause and effect, each generally include specific and general. Because the specific names are added to the top of cause and effect, each receives the name of effect.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a08_7']	初言道者，故受因稱，慧之與智一往且然。	初言道者，故受因稱，慧之與智一往且然。	The initial statement of the path, therefore, receives the name of cause. The wisdom and cognition, in one aspect, are just so.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a09_8']	若依諸經未必全爾，具如《止觀》第三記。	若依諸經未必全爾，具如《止觀》第三記。	If relying on the various sūtras, it is not necessarily entirely so. It is fully like the third record of the Śamathavipaśyanā.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a09_23']	次「此亦」下結文意，亦是融通。	次「此亦」下結文意，亦是融通。	Next, below This is also and so forth, the text meaning of the conclusion, is also the fusion and penetration.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a11_7']	言結意者，既屬圓智故理量相即，非因果總別而因果總別。	言結意者，既屬圓智故理量相即，非因果總別而因果總別。	As for the statement of the text meaning of the conclusion, since it belongs to perfect cognition, therefore principle and phenomena are mutually inclusive. It is not cause and effect, specific and general, while cause and effect are specific and general.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a13_1']	前文雖有如理等言，非文正意，今釋四智正應用之，但須融通耳。	前文雖有如理等言，非文正意，今釋四智正應用之，但須融通耳。	Although the previous text has statements such as in accordance with principle and so forth, it is not the main meaning of the text. Now, in explaining the four cognitions, it should be properly applied, but it must be fused and penetrated.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a14_5']	如彼俗境數量、如於實理契之，各云如者各稱境也。	如彼俗境數量、如於實理契之，各云如者各稱境也。	Just as those worldly objects of quantity and number accord with the real principle, each saying such refers to each corresponding to the object.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a15_17']	然一一位各具二智不二雙入，且寄四位四名便故，不別而別初後理同。	然一一位各具二智不二雙入，且寄四位四名便故，不別而別初後理同。	However, each stage is endowed with the two non-dual wisdoms, entering both simultaneously. For the sake of convenience, the four stages and four names are provisionally distinguished, but they are not separate. The principle of the beginning and end is the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a17_4']	次約門者，門既是教理應先列，今在此者各有其意。	次約門者，門既是教理應先列，今在此者各有其意。	Next, regarding the approach, since the approach is the teaching, it should be listed first. The reason it is here is that each has its own meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a21_12']	若專釋此四，則先教次觀後方智位，此中釋理四皆能詮，於四法中親者先列，具如下文逆順生起，以親先故，故先位智次及教觀，於位智中位為所涉智為能證，則所親能疎故先位次智。	若專釋此四，則先教次觀後方智位，此中釋理四皆能詮，於四法中親者先列，具如下文逆順生起，以親先故，故先位智次及教觀，於位智中位為所涉智為能證，則所親能疎故先位次智。	If one exclusively explains these four, then first the teaching, next the contemplation, and finally the wisdom and stages. In this explanation of the principle, all four are able to expound. Among the four dharmas, the intimate ones are listed first. As below the text says, arising in reverse and forward order, because the intimate ones come first, therefore the stages and wisdom come first, followed by the teaching and contemplation. Within the stages and wisdom, the stages are what is traversed, and the wisdom is what is realized. Then the intimate is the direct, and the distant is the indirect, therefore the stages come first, followed by the wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a22_8']	於教觀中非教不觀，故教前觀後。	於教觀中非教不觀，故教前觀後。	Within the teaching and contemplation, without the teaching there is no contemplation, therefore the teaching comes first, followed by the contemplation.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a22_19']	於中亦先正釋、次融通。	於中亦先正釋、次融通。	Within this, first there is the correct explanation, followed by the integration.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a24_9']	初云「橫」者，初心所稟教法具四，以法相望無復優劣，故名為橫。	初云「橫」者，初心所稟教法具四，以法相望無復優劣，故名為橫。	First, it says horizontal. The teaching and Dharma initially received by the beginner has four aspects. Comparing the Dharma, there is no longer superiority or inferiority, so it is called horizontal.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a27_3']	應知位智多約於豎，約觀乃成非橫非豎，通論並是約非橫豎以論橫豎，觀門亦有淺深故也，教四相望似亦淺深。	應知位智多約於豎，約觀乃成非橫非豎，通論並是約非橫豎以論橫豎，觀門亦有淺深故也，教四相望似亦淺深。	One should know that the stages and wisdom are mostly about the vertical, but in terms of contemplation, they form neither horizontal nor vertical. In general discussion, they are all about non-horizontal and non-vertical to discuss horizontal and vertical. The contemplation gate also has shallow and deep, so the four aspects of the teaching seem to also have shallow and deep.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a28_3']	於中初釋，次「能通」下以理攝教，攝即融也。	於中初釋，次「能通」下以理攝教，攝即融也。	Among them, the first is explained, and below able to penetrate uses principle to include teaching, and inclusion is fusion.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237a29_17']	故門門中皆通智位，從淺至深以歷有等，皆通於觀以至於住，故門成橫。	故門門中皆通智位，從淺至深以歷有等，皆通於觀以至於住，故門成橫。	Therefore, in each gate, it all penetrates wisdom and stages, from shallow to deep, passing through existence and so forth, all penetrating to contemplation, reaching to abiding, so the gate becomes horizontal.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b02_3']	雖對開等但明有等義同開等，非對深淺約位開等。	雖對開等但明有等義同開等，非對深淺約位開等。	Although it is only explained in terms of opening and so forth, the meaning is the same as opening and so forth, not about the stages of shallow and deep, opening and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b03_5']	又一一門中皆云一切者，本顯互通互具故也。	又一一門中皆云一切者，本顯互通互具故也。	Moreover, in each gate, it all says all, because it originally manifests mutual penetration and mutual possession.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b04_1']	猶恐不了，故下更以理性融之。	猶恐不了，故下更以理性融之。	Fearing that it may still not be understood, below it further uses the rational nature to fuse it.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b05_7']	次觀心釋，且語大略以消開等，委論觀法具如《止觀》。	次觀心釋，且語大略以消開等，委論觀法具如《止觀》。	Next, the explanation based on contemplation, speaking only in broad terms to resolve opening and so forth. Detailed discussion of the methods of contemplation is as found in the Mohe Zhiguan.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b07_11']	觀本無障不須融通，所以前之三釋初不述理，故一一釋文後融通，並是附理，理是文義正意故也。	觀本無障不須融通，所以前之三釋初不述理，故一一釋文後融通，並是附理，理是文義正意故也。	Contemplation is originally unobstructed, so there is no need for fusion. Therefore, the first three explanations do not initially discuss principle. Thus, the text after each explanation is fused, all of which is based on principle. Principle is the correct meaning of the text and principles.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b08_6']	觀親依理，是故初論三諦之理。	觀親依理，是故初論三諦之理。	Contemplation is directly based on principle, so it is first discussed in terms of the principle of the three truths.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b08_15']	「是為」下結歸也。	「是為」下結歸也。	This is concludes and returns.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b09_4']	結於三觀以歸開等。	結於三觀以歸開等。	It concludes the three contemplations and returns to opening and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b10_10']	次「所以」下逆順生起者，初明所由於能，次明能顯於所。	次「所以」下逆順生起者，初明所由於能，次明能顯於所。	Next, the reason below is the reverse and forward arising. First, it clarifies the effect based on the cause. Next, it clarifies the ability to manifest the object.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b11_5']	總而言之，結撮四釋以歸理二。	總而言之，結撮四釋以歸理二。	In summary, it concludes the four explanations and returns to the two principles.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b14_19']	既知四釋並釋開等，應知開等一一四重，況復四文親疎互攝、能所映顯，此乃教行人三寄理以辯，理既如是餘三例然，故知今家似借《論》文而冥符《論》旨。	既知四釋並釋開等，應知開等一一四重，況復四文親疎互攝、能所映顯，此乃教行人三寄理以辯，理既如是餘三例然，故知今家似借《論》文而冥符《論》旨。	Since it is known that the four explanations all explain opening and so forth, it should be known that each of the four layers of opening and so forth is repeated, let alone the mutual inclusion of the near and distant in the four texts, and the mutual illumination of the able and the receptive. This is the teaching, practice, and person relying on principle to be distinguished. Since principle is like this, the other three are also the same. Therefore, it is known that the present school seems to borrow the text of the treatise but secretly conforms to the purport of the treatise.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b19_3']	「昔方便教」等者，別初地已去以分四義，即初地為開、從二至六為示、七八為悟、第十為入，而帶地前非佛知見，故別知見不可即為眾生開之，既依別義，亦可通取三賢十地次第對之。	「昔方便教」等者，別初地已去以分四義，即初地為開、從二至六為示、七八為悟、第十為入，而帶地前非佛知見，故別知見不可即為眾生開之，既依別義，亦可通取三賢十地次第對之。	The provisional teachings of the past and so forth. The first ground and above are divided into four meanings. The first ground is opening, from the second to the sixth is revealing, the seventh and eighth are awakening, and the tenth is entering. However, it is not the Buddha's knowledge and insight, so the separate knowledge and insight cannot be immediately opened for sentient beings. Since it relies on separate meanings, it can also be generally taken and compared to the sequence of the three virtuous ones and the ten grounds.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b20_17']	或準古師，如前諸釋判八恒中後四恒是，故別知見信經劫數，頗到故也。	或準古師，如前諸釋判八恒中後四恒是，故別知見信經劫數，頗到故也。	Or according to the ancient masters, as in the previous explanations, the last four rivers of the eight rivers are so. Therefore, the separate knowledge and insight believe in the number of kalpas, and it is possible to reach them.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b21_16']	通教見地開、薄地示、離欲悟、已辦入。	通教見地開、薄地示、離欲悟、已辦入。	In the Shared Teaching, the stage of seeing is opened, the stage of thinness is shown, the stage of separation from desires is realized, and the stage of completion is entered.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b25_14']	三藏教中若約二乘準通教說，若約菩薩，則初祇為開、二祇為示、第三為悟、百劫為入，若兼聖位則以第三百劫為悟、三十四心斷結為入，此之二教始終不明佛知見也。	三藏教中若約二乘準通教說，若約菩薩，則初祇為開、二祇為示、第三為悟、百劫為入，若兼聖位則以第三百劫為悟、三十四心斷結為入，此之二教始終不明佛知見也。	In the Tripiṭaka Teaching, if it is based on the two vehicles, it is explained according to the Shared Teaching. If it is based on the bodhisattvas, then the first asaṃkhyeya kalpa is for opening, the second asaṃkhyeya kalpa is for showing, the third is for realization, and the one hundred kalpas are for entering. If the holy stages are combined, then the third one hundred kalpas is for realization, and the thirty-four mental states that sever the bonds are for entering. These two teachings from beginning to end do not clarify the Buddha's knowledge and insight.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b27_19']	以當教不說是故云無，不可將《婆沙》四階、《般若》三共、《瓔珞》次第，能消《法華》佛之知見。	以當教不說是故云無，不可將《婆沙》四階、《般若》三共、《瓔珞》次第，能消《法華》佛之知見。	Because it is not explained in the corresponding teaching, it is said to be non-existent. The four stages of the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra, the three common [teachings] of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, and the sequence of the Bodhisattva-bhūmi-vyākhyā cannot be used to explain the Buddha's knowledge and insight in the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237b28_18']	故知知見開示等名，名可通用，佛之一字唯局此經。	故知知見開示等名，名可通用，佛之一字唯局此經。	Therefore, it should be known that the names opening, showing, realizing, and entering can be used in common, but the word Buddha is only specific to this sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c02_3']	若其欲以佛義通用，則以當教發心皆求當教佛果，故使開等亦得云佛，而須簡部簡教而已。	若其欲以佛義通用，則以當教發心皆求當教佛果，故使開等亦得云佛，而須簡部簡教而已。	If one wishes to use the meaning of Buddha universally, then according to each teaching's arousal of the mind, all seek the Buddha-fruit of that teaching, so that even the opening and so forth can be called Buddha, but it is necessary to distinguish the sections and teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c04_6']	釋人一中言但化菩薩者據佛意說，窮子自謂準次第論，今從開說故云人一，教行準知。	釋人一中言但化菩薩者據佛意說，窮子自謂準次第論，今從開說故云人一，教行準知。	In explaining the oneness of people, it is said that only bodhisattvas are taught based on the Buddha's intention. The poor son himself considers it based on the sequence. Now, following the opening, it is said that the people are one, and the teaching and practice can be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c06_3']	行一中光宅為教一者，約今判文與光宅不同，非立名也，光宅立名多同舊師。	行一中光宅為教一者，約今判文與光宅不同，非立名也，光宅立名多同舊師。	In explaining the oneness of practice, Guangzhai takes it as the oneness of teaching. The present interpretation of the text differs from Guangzhai, and is not the establishment of the name. The establishment of the name by Guangzhai is mostly the same as the old masters.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c08_3']	「為圓故諸即是一事」者，所作名諸，一是所為，一秖是圓，即是一家之諸諸無不一故也。	「為圓故諸即是一事」者，所作名諸，一是所為，一秖是圓，即是一家之諸諸無不一故也。	For the sake of the perfect, all are one matter means that what is done is called all, and one is what is done. One is precisely the perfect, which is the all of one family, because all are not apart from one.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c08_15']	「亦可」等者，兩向釋也。	「亦可」等者，兩向釋也。	It can also be... is a two-way explanation.

The meaning lies in what is to be done, therefore it is called one. Because it is the affair of one family, it is called an affair. Pointing back to what is to be done is called an affair, therefore it is called teaching and transforming.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c11_19']	「若就行」下牒約行釋，準前初意。	「若就行」下牒約行釋，準前初意。	If it is based on practice, below, it explains based on practice, following the initial meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c14_2']	若準前文既以智為行，至今釋行應具指四智，若不爾者用是行為教指四門，此亦如是。	若準前文既以智為行，至今釋行應具指四智，若不爾者用是行為教指四門，此亦如是。	If it follows the previous text, since wisdom is already taken as practice, when explaining practice now, it should fully point to the four wisdoms. If it is not so, using this practice to point to the four gates of the teaching, this is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c15_6']	能稟之人還修前觀，下二準此，釋理具列良由此也。	能稟之人還修前觀，下二準此，釋理具列良由此也。	The person who receives it still cultivates the previous contemplation. The following two are based on this. The reason for listing the good is precisely because of this.

['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c20_8']	「從但以」下釋教一，於中先正明教一，次「自別教」下明教一中所無，先示正釋，次破三師。	「從但以」下釋教一，於中先正明教一，次「自別教」下明教一中所無，先示正釋，次破三師。	From 'only' below explains the oneness of teaching. Within this, first it correctly clarifies the oneness of teaching, next from the separate teaching below clarifies what is not included in the oneness of teaching. First it shows the correct explanation, next it refutes three masters.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c24_1']	破中光宅尚亦知無四階菩薩，但光宅指昔不明，故《玄》文有破，此云偏行尚該通別，但由光宅猶尚不語通乘是權，故須破之，況今復以菩薩而為第三。	破中光宅尚亦知無四階菩薩，但光宅指昔不明，故《玄》文有破，此云偏行尚該通別，但由光宅猶尚不語通乘是權，故須破之，況今復以菩薩而為第三。	In the refutation, Guangzhai still also knows there are no four stages of bodhisattvas, but Guangzhai points to the past as unclear, so the Profound Text has refutation. This says the biased practice still encompasses the common and separate, but because Guangzhai still does not speak of the common vehicle as provisional, it must be refuted, let alone now again using bodhisattvas as the third.
['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c25_12']	其第二師同於光宅，亦知廢偏菩薩，但列三名望於光宅，顛倒異耳。	其第二師同於光宅，亦知廢偏菩薩，但列三名望於光宅，顛倒異耳。	The second master is the same as Guangzhai, also knowing the biased bodhisattvas are abolished, but listing three names compared to Guangzhai, it is only inverted and different.

['ZH_T34_1719_05a:0237c29_1']	第三師同於嘉祥，嘉祥尚然，故並不知三乘共位，及《瓔珞》等次第行者是方便菩薩。	第三師同於嘉祥，嘉祥尚然，故並不知三乘共位，及《瓔珞》等次第行者是方便菩薩。	The third teacher is the same as Jiacang. Jiacang still agrees, so they both do not know that the stages of the three vehicles and the sequential practitioners of the Yōuìyào are expedient bodhisattvas.

Therefore, it is known that the previous nine each have three times. Because it wants to clarify that the nine times are just the nine worlds, and the nine worlds are just the three times. The three times are just a moment. Every moment exhausts the past and future. This is the mutual inclusion of long and short.

It is just about the three and nine facing each other to discuss, in order to attract the same. If the three times are the same as the ten directions, then the dust worlds are all the same.

The section on Śākyamuni only lacks the first, and the three Buddhas of the past only have two each.

This is because the character also connects it to below, and because the inclusion is not the main point, the text above says it is not as good as the general text revealing it.

From Śāriputra, these buddhas... it corresponds to the general text. Therefore, in the previous analysis it says, The chapters on the buddhas of the three times each clarify the teaching and practice, and later it generally clarifies the person and principle.

The reason it does not open first is because in the general text below there is no general disclosure of the provisional, only the text of revealing the real. Therefore, corresponding to the three times there is both the provisional and the real, and the general and specific are inconvenient.
