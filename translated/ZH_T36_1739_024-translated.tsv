['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883a28_1']	一舉體示迷門、二凡夫迷體成苦門、三不了緣生無體流轉門、四菩薩達真愍苦接生門。	一舉體示迷門、二凡夫迷體成苦門、三不了緣生無體流轉門、四菩薩達真愍苦接生門。	The first is the gate of revealing the deluded essence, the second is the gate of the deluded essence of ordinary beings forming suffering, the third is the gate of the non-understanding of dependent arising being without essence and flowing, and the fourth is the gate of bodhisattvas realizing the truth, commiserating with suffering, and connecting with beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b03_2']	第一舉體示迷門者，即如初三行，是舉諸佛正法如是甚深、如是寂靜、如是寂滅、如是無相等，愍念凡夫不悟，邪見無明長夜覆翳輪，轉苦流。	第一舉體示迷門者，即如初三行，是舉諸佛正法如是甚深、如是寂靜、如是寂滅、如是無相等，愍念凡夫不悟，邪見無明長夜覆翳輪，轉苦流。	As for the first gate of revealing the deluded essence, it is like the first three lines, which raise the question of why the true Dharma of all buddhas is so profound, so tranquil, so quiescent, so signless, etc., and commiserate with ordinary beings who do not realize it, are covered by the long night of wrong views and ignorance, and flow in the current of suffering.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b03_5']	問曰：	問曰：	A question is asked:
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b04_7']	一切眾生體自真理智等如來，何故從迷成諸苦業？	一切眾生體自真理智等如來，何故從迷成諸苦業？	Since the essence of all sentient beings is originally the same as the wisdom and such of the Tathāgata, why do they form the karma of suffering from delusion?
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b04_10']	答曰：	答曰：	An answer is given:
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b05_10']	為真如理智體皆無性，無性理智不能自知。	為真如理智體皆無性，無性理智不能自知。	Because the essence of the true suchness of wisdom and cognition is all without nature. Without the nature of wisdom and cognition, one cannot know oneself.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b05_20']	若也自知，不名無性。	若也自知，不名無性。	If one could know oneself, it would not be called without nature.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b07_4']	但有眾生緣隨境流轉，不如善惡，為隨境變，業有差殊。	但有眾生緣隨境流轉，不如善惡，為隨境變，業有差殊。	There are only sentient beings who follow conditions and flow with objects, not according to good and evil. They change according to objects, and their karma has distinctions.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b08_11']	或因佛菩薩為說苦因、或自因苦生厭，方求正見不苦之道。	或因佛菩薩為說苦因、或自因苦生厭，方求正見不苦之道。	Either because the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas explain the causes of suffering, or because suffering itself gives rise to disgust, one then seeks the path of right views that is free from suffering.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b09_4']	若也未厭苦果，終不信聖言。	若也未厭苦果，終不信聖言。	If one has not yet become disgusted with the fruits of suffering, one will never believe the words of the sages.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b10_17']	未可自知是真是假、是苦是樂，但受得其生都無厭患，驚怖熱惱都不覺知。	未可自知是真是假、是苦是樂，但受得其生都無厭患，驚怖熱惱都不覺知。	One cannot yet know for oneself what is true and false, what is suffering and what is happiness, but one simply accepts birth without any disgust, fear, or distress, and does not realize it at all.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b12_11']	若不深自勤修責躬匪懈，作諸定觀入法界之真門者，終未可盡其苦源也。	若不深自勤修責躬匪懈，作諸定觀入法界之真門者，終未可盡其苦源也。	If one does not diligently cultivate oneself, reproach oneself, and be untiring, and engage in various meditative contemplations to enter the true gate of the Dharma realm, one will never be able to exhaust the source of suffering.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b14_22']	第二凡夫迷體成苦門者，如後「凡夫心墮邪見」已下，「於三界田中復生苦芽」，有六行經是。	第二凡夫迷體成苦門者，如後「凡夫心墮邪見」已下，「於三界田中復生苦芽」，有六行經是。	The second gate of ordinary beings' delusion of the essence forming suffering is as follows: The minds of ordinary beings fall into wrong views and below, in the field of the three realms, the sprouts of suffering are born again. There are six lines of text.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b16_5']	於此段中，所受苦生有十八種煩惱，皆依二種煩惱起故。	於此段中，所受苦生有十八種煩惱，皆依二種煩惱起故。	In this section, there are eighteen kinds of afflictions that arise from suffering, all of which arise based on two kinds of afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b16_10']	云何為二？	云何為二？	What are the two?
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b17_13']	一根本無明為長夜所覆、二邪見逐境常流轉不息。	一根本無明為長夜所覆、二邪見逐境常流轉不息。	First, being covered by the long night of fundamental ignorance; second, following objects with wrong views, always flowing and turning without rest.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b19_3']	此二種無明，非達得成根本智方成智用，非三乘空觀能斷得故。	此二種無明，非達得成根本智方成智用，非三乘空觀能斷得故。	These two kinds of ignorance cannot be eliminated by the wisdom of the three vehicles' empty contemplation, and therefore cannot become the function of wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b20_17']	是故《勝鬘經》云「聲聞緣覺及淨土菩薩，但能折伏現行煩惱，不名為斷煩惱。	是故《勝鬘經》云「聲聞緣覺及淨土菩薩，但能折伏現行煩惱，不名為斷煩惱。	Therefore, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says: Śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas of the pure land can only subdue the presently active afflictions, but are not said to have eliminated the afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b21_8']	為折伏故，得變易生死。	為折伏故，得變易生死。	In order to subdue them, they attain the life-span of the transformation body.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b24_3']	」菩薩得隨意樂生身，皆有忻厭自他佛剎，皆未得法界普光明智，未得與十方諸佛同一智海，永絕邪見自他取捨一切見流。	」菩薩得隨意樂生身，皆有忻厭自他佛剎，皆未得法界普光明智，未得與十方諸佛同一智海，永絕邪見自他取捨一切見流。	 Bodhisattvas who attain the body born of the power of vows all have delight and aversion, and their own and other buddha lands, but they have not yet attained the wisdom of universal light of the Dharma realm, have not yet attained to be of the same wisdom ocean as the buddhas of the ten directions, and have forever cut off wrong views, the flow of all views of self and other, acceptance and rejection.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b25_9']	為迷前二種無明妄生厭捨，別證真如及空相，迷大智故。	為迷前二種無明妄生厭捨，別證真如及空相，迷大智故。	Because of being confused about the aforementioned two kinds of ignorance, they mistakenly give rise to aversion and abandonment, separately realizing suchness and emptiness, and because of being confused about great wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b26_9']	是故《淨名經》云「一切煩惱諸塵勞門以為佛種。	是故《淨名經》云「一切煩惱諸塵勞門以為佛種。	Therefore, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says, All afflictions and the gates of defilements are the seeds of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b27_5']	」此無明邪見，一乘菩薩達而成智；	」此無明邪見，一乘菩薩達而成智；	This ignorance and wrong views, for bodhisattvas of the One Vehicle, are realized as wisdom;
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b28_8']	三乘折伏現行，亦云留惑潤生，此乃皆非稱智而說。	三乘折伏現行，亦云留惑潤生，此乃皆非稱智而說。	for those of the Three Vehicles who subdue their present activities, it is also said that they leave behind afflictions to nourish rebirth. This is not at all called wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883b29_9']	不同一乘，依不動智上自有無邊大自在用門。	不同一乘，依不動智上自有無邊大自在用門。	It is not the same as the One Vehicle, which relies on the wisdom of imperturbability above, and has its own boundless gates of great sovereign functions.
['ZH_T36_1739_024:0883c01_10']	如十信位中十箇智佛，是以不動智佛為首。	如十信位中十箇智佛，是以不動智佛為首。	Like the ten wisdom buddhas in the stage of ten faiths, it takes the Buddha of imperturbable wisdom as the leader.
