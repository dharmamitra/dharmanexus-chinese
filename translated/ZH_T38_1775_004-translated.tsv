This is because the gods see Maitreya receiving the prediction and thus have the honor of being the next to become a Buddha. They consequently fixate their minds on attainment and aspire to receive the prediction, so he first clarifies the nonexistence of receiving the prediction.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0360c24_10']	受記必由心生，故尋生以求記。	受記必由心生，故尋生以求記。	Receiving the prediction must arise from the mind, so he seeks the prediction by investigating the arising of the mind.

Based on this, it seems to preserve the practice of nonretrogression in order to encourage the arousal of the unsurpassed mind.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0360c27_16']	雖曰勝期，猶未免乎累。	雖曰勝期，猶未免乎累。	Although it is said to be a superior period, it still cannot avoid being defiled.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0360c28_7']	教迹不泯，故致斯呵。	教迹不泯，故致斯呵。	The traces of the teachings are not extinguished, so this reprimand is brought about.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0360c29_17']	然經云「補處大士心無不一、智無不周」，應物而動，何闕之有？	然經云「補處大士心無不一、智無不周」，應物而動，何闕之有？	However, the sutra says, The great being who is next in line to become a buddha has a mind that is not one, and wisdom that is not all-encompassing. He responds to beings and moves, so what is lacking?
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a01_19']	是由得失同懷、脩短迭應，利彼而動、無計諸己。	是由得失同懷、脩短迭應，利彼而動、無計諸己。	This is why gain and loss are held in the same way, and long and short respond to each other. He benefits others and moves, without considering himself.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a03_7']	故彌勒假有以啟始、淨名居宗以濟終，互為郢匠器彼淳朴。	故彌勒假有以啟始、淨名居宗以濟終，互為郢匠器彼淳朴。	Therefore, Maitreya provisionally exists to initiate the beginning, and Vimalakīrti abides in the essence to save the end, mutually serving as a skilled craftsman to shape the pure and simple.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a04_12']	雖復迹同儒墨、致教不一，然相成之美實存其中矣。	雖復迹同儒墨、致教不一，然相成之美實存其中矣。	Although their traces are the same as those of Ru and Mo, their teachings are not the same, yet the beauty of mutually complementing each other truly exists within them.

['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a11_15']	然有三品，聲聞也、辟支佛也、佛也。	然有三品，聲聞也、辟支佛也、佛也。	However, there are three levels: that of the śrāvakas, that of the pratyekabuddhas, and that of the Buddhas.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a13_7']	二乘各於其道為菩提耳，非所謂菩提也，唯佛菩提為無上正遍菩提也。	二乘各於其道為菩提耳，非所謂菩提也，唯佛菩提為無上正遍菩提也。	The two vehicles each have their own bodhi within their respective paths, but it is not what is called bodhi. Only the bodhi of the Buddha is the unsurpassed right and perfect enlightenment.

['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a18_2']	而彼生著情，便貪記以有行，斯則復是見菩提可得也。	而彼生著情，便貪記以有行，斯則復是見菩提可得也。	Yet they became attached and greedy for the prediction and practice, which again is the view that bodhi can be attained.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a20_5']	是以維摩詰即推彌勒受記為無，以呵其說行之意，遣彼著也，然後乃更釋其見菩提心焉。	是以維摩詰即推彌勒受記為無，以呵其說行之意，遣彼著也，然後乃更釋其見菩提心焉。	Therefore, Vimalakīrti immediately pushed for Maitreya's acceptance of the prophecy as non-existent, reprimanding his intention to speak and practice, and dispelling his attachment. Only then did he further explain his view of the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a21_6']	夫受記者，要以四事合成，一一推之皆無也。	夫受記者，要以四事合成，一一推之皆無也。	The acceptance of a prophecy must be formed by four things, each of which is examined and found to be non-existent.

Interacting within one life and accepting the prophecy, one must first examine the one life.

Therefore, it is said, Which life is used to receive Maitreya's prophecy?
['ZH_T38_1775_004:0361a27_11']	過去耶、未來耶、現在耶。	過去耶、未來耶、現在耶。	Is it the past, the future, or the present?
