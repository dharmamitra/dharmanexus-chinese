['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892b20_15']	「法界圓融」者，色心依正以即性故，趣指一法遍攝一切。	「法界圓融」者，色心依正以即性故，趣指一法遍攝一切。	The perfect fusion of the Dharma realm means that form, mind, the dependent and the perfectly accomplished are identical to the nature. Therefore, pointing to a single dharma completely includes everything.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892b22_6']	諸法遍攝亦復如是，法法互遍皆無際畔，乃以無界而為其界。	諸法遍攝亦復如是，法法互遍皆無際畔，乃以無界而為其界。	All dharmas are completely included in the same way. Each dharma is mutually all-pervasive, all without boundaries, and thus uses the boundless as its boundary.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892b24_3']	此之法界無不圓融，即百界千如、百如千界也，是故得云唯色唯心、唯依唯正；	此之法界無不圓融，即百界千如、百如千界也，是故得云唯色唯心、唯依唯正；	This Dharma realm is perfectly integrated, encompassing the hundred realms and thousand suchnesses, as well as the hundred suchnesses and thousand realms. Therefore, it can be said that it is only form, only mind, only the dependent, and only the principal.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892b24_12']	若不爾者即非圓融。	若不爾者即非圓融。	If it were not so, it would not be perfectly integrated.

With the Dharma realm responding to the Dharma realm's capacities, it is also with the Dharma realm's capacities giving rise to the Dharma realm's response.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892b27_15']	法界無二能所自忘，感應尚忘，體用寧異？	法界無二能所自忘，感應尚忘，體用寧異？	The Dharma realm is non-dual, and subject and object are naturally forgotten. When stimulus and response are forgotten, how can essence and function be different?
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892b28_15']	故雖設應，無應可存，故云「像無所像」。	故雖設應，無應可存，故云「像無所像」。	Therefore, although he manifests responses, there is no response to be found, so it is said that the image has nothing to image.

They are ultimately equal, unchanging, and indestructible. They are only one mind, and therefore called thusness.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c03_16']	」又云「此真如體無有可遣，以一切法悉皆真故；	」又云「此真如體無有可遣，以一切法悉皆真故；	 It also says, The essence of this thusness cannot be refuted, because all dharmas are completely true;

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c05_18']	既不可破立、自絕言想，則與河沙煩惱本不相應，故曰清淨。	既不可破立、自絕言想，則與河沙煩惱本不相應，故曰清淨。	Since it cannot be refuted or established, and self-extinguishes verbal thoughts, it is not associated with the original afflictions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and is therefore called pure.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c07_15']	」觀音證此而為本體，即以此體示諸眾生，令觀行知或真似見，此知見者成伏斷益。	」觀音證此而為本體，即以此體示諸眾生，令觀行知或真似見，此知見者成伏斷益。	Avalokitêśvara realized this as the fundamental essence, and used this essence to show it to all sentient beings, causing them to know the true or similar seeing through contemplation and practice. This knowing and seeing brings the benefits of subduing and eliminating [afflictions].
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c09_4']	若其未有此知見者，但能三業精進成機，亦離眾苦，悉得名化。	若其未有此知見者，但能三業精進成機，亦離眾苦，悉得名化。	If one has not yet had this knowing and seeing, but is able to form the capacity through the diligent practice of the three karmas, one will also be free from various sufferings, and can all be called transformed.

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c11_3']	此二種身皆非智德，今何以化而為真身？	此二種身皆非智德，今何以化而為真身？	These two kinds of bodies are both not the virtue of wisdom. Why then take transformation as the true body?

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c14_19']	若欲化轉凡賢入聖，須示真智，若非真身不能化轉。	若欲化轉凡賢入聖，須示真智，若非真身不能化轉。	If one wishes to transform ordinary beings and sages into sages, one must show true wisdom. If it is not the true body, one cannot transform.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c15_18']	言「化無所化」者，據性平，等忘於化功。	言「化無所化」者，據性平，等忘於化功。	As for transformation with nothing to transform, this is based on the equality of nature, forgetting the merit of transformation.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c16_14']	雖令九道皆趣涅槃，而無眾生得滅度者。	雖令九道皆趣涅槃，而無眾生得滅度者。	Although causing the nine realms to all head towards nirvana, there are no sentient beings who attain liberation.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c17_17']	平等真法界，佛不度眾生，終日化物，終日無化。	平等真法界，佛不度眾生，終日化物，終日無化。	In the true and equal dharma realm, the Buddha does not liberate sentient beings. All day long transforming beings, all day long there is no transformation.

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c19_14']	色心諸法雖無生性，因緣和合法爾而生。	色心諸法雖無生性，因緣和合法爾而生。	Although dharmas of form and mind have no nature of arising, they arise due to the convergence of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c20_18']	觀音妙證同諸法性，雖無形相，眾機扣之無像不現。	觀音妙證同諸法性，雖無形相，眾機扣之無像不現。	Avalokitêśvara's wondrous realization is the same as the nature of all dharmas. Although he has no form or appearance, when beings of various capacities invoke him, no image fails to appear.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c21_16']	此由絕於垂應之念，故能遍應法界群機。	此由絕於垂應之念，故能遍應法界群機。	This is because he is free from the thought of bestowing responses, and thus he can universally respond to the various capacities of beings in the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c22_14']	其猶明鑒無念而現，故云無所而不像。	其猶明鑒無念而現，故云無所而不像。	It is like a clear mirror that reflects without thought. Therefore, it is said that there is nothing that is not reflected.

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c24_12']	雖中實性不可變化，不變而變，迷悟宛然。	雖中實性不可變化，不變而變，迷悟宛然。	Although the true nature in the middle cannot be transformed, it transforms without changing, and delusion and enlightenment are still distinct.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0892c27_11']	觀音順理雖知不變，常以真智化一切凡成不二聖，此則由無化物之念故，遍令他革迷成悟，其猶磁石無念而吸，故云無所而不化。	觀音順理雖知不變，常以真智化一切凡成不二聖，此則由無化物之念故，遍令他革迷成悟，其猶磁石無念而吸，故云無所而不化。	Although Avalokitêśvara accords with principle and knows that it does not change, he always uses true wisdom to transform all ordinary beings into non-dual sages. This is because he is free from the thought of transforming beings, and thus he universally causes others to transform delusion into enlightenment. It is like a magnet that attracts without thought. Therefore, it is said that there is nothing that is not transformed.

The specific refers to the body of the characteristics of wondrous enlightenment wisdom, because the three thousand real marks are thoroughly exhausted.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0893a05_14']	尚非等覺心眼觀見，況乎下地及凡小耶？	尚非等覺心眼觀見，況乎下地及凡小耶？	It is still not seen by the mind-eye of equal enlightenment, let alone by those below the grounds or ordinary beings and small vehicles.

In this teaching, the bodhisattva only seeks the person and Dharma of the Buddha, the four vows of compassion, the six perfections of merit and wisdom, subdues delusions but has not yet eliminated them, so one cannot discuss the seven such as true and responsive.

It is just that the teaching methods are shown according to the capacities, leading to differences between the small and great vehicles, the common and uncommon. Therefore, among the sages, their characteristics are distinguished.

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897b19_17']	若其人執雖被窮逐，見惑不破而更度入實法之中於陰生見，即須觀陰無常無我破此見惑。	若其人執雖被窮逐，見惑不破而更度入實法之中於陰生見，即須觀陰無常無我破此見惑。	If the attachment to the person is exhausted, but the delusions of insight are not broken through, and one is then led to enter into the real dharmas, giving rise to views regarding the aggregates, then one must contemplate the aggregates as impermanent and selfless to break through these delusions of views.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897b20_16']	故法空觀能破二惑，乃於節節各有人法。	故法空觀能破二惑，乃於節節各有人法。	Therefore, the contemplation of the emptiness of dharmas can destroy the two delusions, and there are people and dharmas in each stage.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897b22_13']	若見惑未伏即有漏人法，其能伏者即方便人法，發真斷結及生有餘皆無漏人法。	若見惑未伏即有漏人法，其能伏者即方便人法，發真斷結及生有餘皆無漏人法。	If the delusions of views have not been subdued, there are still contaminated people and dharmas. Those who can subdue them are expedient people and dharmas. Those who give rise to true wisdom, sever the bonds, and are born in the remaining [realms] all have uncontaminated people and dharmas.

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c17_6']	初、明體空通三教。	初、明體空通三教。	First, clarifying the emptiness of essence is common to the three teachings.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c18_10']	「不言人法空不空」者，異彼《毘曇》觀人空時未破實法。	「不言人法空不空」者，異彼《毘曇》觀人空時未破實法。	Not saying that the emptiness of person and dharmas is empty or not empty means it is different from the Abhidharma, where when contemplating the emptiness of person, the real dharmas are not yet destroyed.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c20_7']	「不言體有假用」者，異彼《成實》攬實法體成假人用，但觀人法本自不生、今亦無滅。	「不言體有假用」者，異彼《成實》攬實法體成假人用，但觀人法本自不生、今亦無滅。	Not saying that the essence exists and the function is provisional means it is different from the Satyasiddhi, which takes the real dharma essence to form the provisional person function. It only contemplates that person and dharmas are originally unborn and now also non-extinguishing.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c21_10']	色是五陰之首、我是十六之初，故各舉一以例其餘。	色是五陰之首、我是十六之初，故各舉一以例其餘。	Form is the head of the five skandhas, and I is the beginning of the sixteen. Therefore, each is mentioned to serve as an example for the rest.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c21_20']	人法即空，故曰如也。	人法即空，故曰如也。	Person and dharmas are empty, therefore it is called suchness.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c23_3']	觀此二空始因終果，若人若法不生不滅名為涅槃。	觀此二空始因終果，若人若法不生不滅名為涅槃。	Contemplating these two kinds of emptiness, from beginning to end, whether person or dharma, non-arising and non-ceasing is called nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c24_6']	常修此觀以行正道，應知《大品》談空義含深淺何者。	常修此觀以行正道，應知《大品》談空義含深淺何者。	Constantly cultivating this contemplation to practice the right path, one should know that the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra discusses the meaning of emptiness, which includes both profound and shallow aspects.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c25_6']	若鈍根者，謂但空有，即入偏空，證其通理。	若鈍根者，謂但空有，即入偏空，證其通理。	If one is of dull faculties, it means only emptiness exists, then one enters biased emptiness and realizes the common principle.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c26_9']	若利根人，一聞於空知空二邊，名見中空，屬後二教。	若利根人，一聞於空知空二邊，名見中空，屬後二教。	If one is of sharp faculties, upon hearing emptiness one knows emptiness has two extremes, called seeing the emptiness of the middle, belonging to the latter two teachings.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c26_18', 'ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c27_8']	又此中空復分二種：🔽離邊而解，此當別理；	又此中空復分二種： 離邊而解，此當別理；	Moreover, emptiness in this context is further divided into two kinds:🔽Liberating from extremes, this belongs to the separate principle;
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0897c27_18']	即邊而解，乃屬圓理。	即邊而解，乃屬圓理。	Liberating within the extremes, this belongs to the perfect principle.

['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a01_17']	又復應知彼經空義雖通三教，今之人法非前二種，唯用最後即邊之空，淨其二執成圓假實。	又復應知彼經空義雖通三教，今之人法非前二種，唯用最後即邊之空，淨其二執成圓假實。	Moreover, it should be known that although the meaning of emptiness in that sūtra is common to the three teachings, the person and Dharma of today are not the previous two kinds, only using the final emptiness of the extremes to purify the two attachments and accomplish the perfect provisional and real.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a02_8']	若不爾者，非今人法。	若不爾者，非今人法。	If it were not so, it would not be the person and Dharma of today.

Previously clarifying the two emptinesses without clarifying the conditions and understanding, although the meaning is in the perfect, those of the common [teaching] have a share.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a04_20', 'ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a06_3']	今約二空明二佛性，故在圓別，不涉通門。🔽今文既以觀人法空明二因種，一言於空須分二種：	今約二空明二佛性，故在圓別，不涉通門。 今文既以觀人法空明二因種，一言於空須分二種：	Now, since the two kinds of Buddha-nature are clarified based on the two emptinesses, they belong to the perfect and distinct, not involving the common approach.🔽Since this text clarifies the two causes and conditions by contemplating the emptiness of person and Dharma, the single word emptiness must be divided into two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a06_17']	若畢竟空觀於人法，顯圓二因；	若畢竟空觀於人法，顯圓二因；	If one contemplates the emptiness of person and Dharma with the contemplation of ultimate emptiness, it reveals the two perfect causes;
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a07_11']	若次第空觀於人法，即別二因。	若次第空觀於人法，即別二因。	If one contemplates emptiness sequentially in terms of person and dharmas, then there are two separate causes.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a08_8']	文以無上人法為緣了種，亦須善別。	文以無上人法為緣了種，亦須善別。	The text takes the unsurpassed person and dharma as the seeds of conditions and realization, and one must also be good at distinguishing them.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a09_2']	百界假實為佛涅槃，斯為圓觀；	百界假實為佛涅槃，斯為圓觀；	The hundred realms of provisional reality are the Buddha's nirvana, which is the perfect contemplation;
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a09_12']	若唯佛界，故屬別也。	若唯佛界，故屬別也。	if it is only the Buddha realm, then it belongs to the distinct.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a10_1']	文意在圓，別人有分。	文意在圓，別人有分。	The meaning of the text is in the perfect, with a share for the distinct person.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a10_6']	釋此為二：	釋此為二：	The explanation is in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a11_10']	初了因中「以觀人空即了因種」者，大乘空觀蕩情顯德。	初了因中「以觀人空即了因種」者，大乘空觀蕩情顯德。	First, in the cause of realization, using the contemplation of the emptiness of person as the seed of the cause of realization means that the Mahayana contemplation of emptiness eliminates emotions and reveals virtues.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a12_8']	今經既以智慧目人，故人執空則智人顯。	今經既以智慧目人，故人執空則智人顯。	Since this sutra takes wisdom as the eyes of a person, if the attachment to the person is empty, then the wise person is revealed.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a14_17']	況觀本空乃顯本智，本智即是性德了因，故引論文果佛為證，則因果不二、修性一如，故知今文正明圓觀。	況觀本空乃顯本智，本智即是性德了因，故引論文果佛為證，則因果不二、修性一如，故知今文正明圓觀。	Moreover, contemplating the original emptiness reveals the original wisdom. The original wisdom is precisely the nature-born cause of realization, so the treatise is quoted to take the fruition Buddha as the proof. Then cause and effect are non-dual, and cultivation and nature are one suchness. Therefore, one should know that the present text clarifies the perfect contemplation.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a16_8']	言「始覺人空終覺法空」者，人是覺智，不獨自空人執，復能空於法執。	言「始覺人空終覺法空」者，人是覺智，不獨自空人執，復能空於法執。	As for the initial realization of the emptiness of person and the final realization of the emptiness of dharmas, person refers to the wisdom of realization, which is not only empty of personal grasping but is also able to empty of grasping at dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a16_18']	雖云始終，非次第觀。	雖云始終，非次第觀。	Although it is said to be initial and final, it is not a sequential contemplation.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a18_1']	此由大乘觀性相二空，破生法二執、顯真俗二諦。	此由大乘觀性相二空，破生法二執、顯真俗二諦。	This is because the Mahayana contemplates the two kinds of emptiness of nature and characteristics, breaks through the two kinds of grasping at self and dharmas, and reveals the two truths of the conventional and the ultimate.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a18_13']	觀雖不次，說有始終故也。	觀雖不次，說有始終故也。	Although the contemplation is not sequential, it is said to have an initial and final stage.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a19_15']	如《大本疏》云「真諦即法空，俗諦即生空，俗假真實。	如《大本疏》云「真諦即法空，俗諦即生空，俗假真實。	As the commentary on the main text says, The ultimate truth is the emptiness of dharmas, and the conventional truth is the emptiness of self. The conventional is false, while the ultimate is real.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a21_4']	」《輔行》云「若有性執，世而非諦，破性執已乃名世諦，故云世諦破性。	」《輔行》云「若有性執，世而非諦，破性執已乃名世諦，故云世諦破性。	The auxiliary practice says, If there is grasping at inherent nature, it is the world but not the truth. After breaking through grasping at inherent nature, it is then called the conventional truth. Therefore, it is said that the conventional truth breaks through inherent nature.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a22_3']	性執破已但有名字，名之為假，假即是相。	性執破已但有名字，名之為假，假即是相。	After breaking through grasping at inherent nature, there are only names, which are called false. False means characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a23_3']	為空相故觀於法性，觀理證真名真諦破相。	為空相故觀於法性，觀理證真名真諦破相。	In order to contemplate the characteristics of emptiness, one contemplates the nature of dharmas. Contemplating the principle and realizing the truth is called the ultimate truth breaking through characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1727_001:0898a24_2']	空非前後，二諦同時，為辯性相前後說耳。	空非前後，二諦同時，為辯性相前後說耳。	Emptiness is not before and after, and the two truths are simultaneous. The sequence of nature and characteristics is spoken of only for the sake of explanation.

Quiescence is the real dharmas of the hundred realms, and illumination is the provisional persons of the hundred realms. This provisional and real can be deluded and can be understood.
