['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b08_16']	金剛有三義，謂堅、利、明也。	金剛有三義，謂堅、利、明也。	Vajra has three meanings: firm, sharp, and bright.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b09_10']	般若亦三義，謂實相、觀照、文字也。	般若亦三義，謂實相、觀照、文字也。	Prajna also has three meanings: true aspect, contemplation, and written form.

['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b11_9']	論者議也，亦三義，謂議理、議智、議行也。	論者議也，亦三義，謂議理、議智、議行也。	Discussion means discussion, and also has three meanings, namely, discussing principles, discussing wisdom, and discussing practices.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b12_3']	纂要亦三義，謂要義、要行、要文也。	纂要亦三義，謂要義、要行、要文也。	The compilation also has three meanings, namely, essential meaning, essential practice, and essential text.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b13_17']	且金剛三義者，以萬物不能壞，能壞於萬物，復能有照用，可喻三種般若矣。	且金剛三義者，以萬物不能壞，能壞於萬物，復能有照用，可喻三種般若矣。	As for the three meanings of vajra, it is indestructible by myriad things, can destroy myriad things, and can have illuminating functions, which can be compared to the three kinds of prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b15_8']	堅喻實相，以其雖經多劫流迸六道，未嘗生滅未嘗虧缺，故云堅也。	堅喻實相，以其雖經多劫流迸六道，未嘗生滅未嘗虧缺，故云堅也。	Hardness is likened to the true aspect, because although it passes through many kalpas and wanders in the six realms, it has never been born or extinguished, and has never been deficient, therefore it is called hard.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b15_15']	故《心經》云：	故《心經》云：	Therefore, the Heart Sutra says:
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b16_15']	「是諸法空相，不生不滅、不垢不淨、不增不減」等。	「是諸法空相，不生不滅、不垢不淨、不增不減」等。	The nature of these dharmas is emptiness, unborn, unceasing, unstained, not pure, not increasing, not decreasing, and so forth.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b17_15']	利喻觀照般若，謂此顯時照諸法空，故言利也。	利喻觀照般若，謂此顯時照諸法空，故言利也。	Sharpness is likened to the prajñā of contemplation, which means that when this is manifested, it illuminates the emptiness of all dharmas, therefore it is called sharp.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b17_22']	故《心經》云：	故《心經》云：	Therefore, the Heart Sutra says:
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b19_13']	「觀自在菩薩行深般若波羅蜜多時，照見五蘊皆空，度一切苦厄」乃至云：	「觀自在菩薩行深般若波羅蜜多時，照見五蘊皆空，度一切苦厄」乃至云：	When Avalokitêśvara Bodhisattva was practicing the profound prajñā-pāramitā, he perceived that the five skandhas are all empty, and thereby transcended all suffering and distress. It goes on to say:
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b19_22']	「無智亦無得」等。	「無智亦無得」等。	There is neither knowledge nor attainment.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b21_5']	明喻文字般若，以文字能詮顯彰，明實相觀照令顯現故。	明喻文字般若，以文字能詮顯彰，明實相觀照令顯現故。	The explanation is that the written word is like prajñā, because the written word can expound and clarify the apparent characteristics of the real characteristic and contemplation, causing them to become apparent.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b22_4']	由斯三義似彼金剛，故舉金剛以喻般若。	由斯三義似彼金剛，故舉金剛以喻般若。	Because of these three meanings, it is similar to that vajra, therefore it uses the vajra as a metaphor for prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b25_4']	然此般若諸佛眾生悉皆有之，由彼在纏故不能利用，苟能聞教解悟內外熏力，則能斷煩惱出生死，理智相冥能起大用，與佛無異。	然此般若諸佛眾生悉皆有之，由彼在纏故不能利用，苟能聞教解悟內外熏力，則能斷煩惱出生死，理智相冥能起大用，與佛無異。	However, this prajñā is possessed by all buddhas and sentient beings. Because it is in the entanglements, it is unable to be utilized. If one is able to hear the teachings, understand and awaken to the power of internal and external perfuming, then one will be able to sever afflictions and escape birth and death. The characteristics of wisdom and principle merge, and one is able to give rise to great function, no different from the buddhas.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b27_6']	其猶金在鑛中不能隨用，苟能出鑛必能成器斷物，故知此慧無不有之，故知此慧能建大義。	其猶金在鑛中不能隨用，苟能出鑛必能成器斷物，故知此慧無不有之，故知此慧能建大義。	It is just like gold in ore, unable to be used as one wishes. If one is able to extract the ore, it will certainly be able to form implements and cut things. Therefore, one should know that this wisdom is not without existence, and one should know that this wisdom is able to establish great meaning.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b27_19']	今云般若，蓋大慧之梵音也。	今云般若，蓋大慧之梵音也。	Now it is called prajñā, which is the Sanskrit sound for great wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170b29_2']	金剛即般若之正喻，法喻雙彰，故曰金剛般若也。	金剛即般若之正喻，法喻雙彰，故曰金剛般若也。	Vajra is the correct metaphor for prajñā. Since both the principle and the metaphor are shown, it is called the Vajra Prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c01_2']	若準經題，具足合云波羅蜜，即歎慧之功也。	若準經題，具足合云波羅蜜，即歎慧之功也。	If based on the title of the sūtra, it should be fully called pāramitā, which praises the function of wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c01_15']	唐言彼岸到，此猶西域之風；	唐言彼岸到，此猶西域之風；	The Chinese translation is reaching the other shore, which is still the style of the Western Regions;
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c02_5']	若順此方，合云到彼岸。	若順此方，合云到彼岸。	if following this land, it should be called reaching the other shore.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c04_6']	彼岸者即是涅槃，為對生死之此故，號涅槃為彼，意明般若是到彼岸慧，斯則慧之別相也。	彼岸者即是涅槃，為對生死之此故，號涅槃為彼，意明般若是到彼岸慧，斯則慧之別相也。	The other shore is precisely nirvāṇa, because it is opposed to this side of birth and death, so nirvāṇa is called the other. The meaning is to clarify that prajñā is the wisdom that reaches the other shore, which is the specific characteristic of wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c05_4']	然到彼岸慧略有二意，所謂頓、漸也。	然到彼岸慧略有二意，所謂頓、漸也。	However, there are roughly two meanings for the wisdom that reaches the other shore, namely sudden and gradual.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c07_3']	頓者，此慧顯時，一剎那間照諸法空，即是到彼岸，故名到彼岸慧，以不歷多時乃名為頓。	頓者，此慧顯時，一剎那間照諸法空，即是到彼岸，故名到彼岸慧，以不歷多時乃名為頓。	Sudden means that when this wisdom manifests, in a single instant it illuminates the emptiness of all phenomena, which is precisely reaching the other shore, so it is called the wisdom that reaches the other shore. Because it does not take many moments, it is called sudden.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c10_13']	漸者雖則頓照法空，且習以性成，任運計執，所以策彼頓悟之慧覺察妄情，損之又損之以至於無為，此則究竟到於彼岸，亦名到彼岸慧，以歷多時故名為漸。	漸者雖則頓照法空，且習以性成，任運計執，所以策彼頓悟之慧覺察妄情，損之又損之以至於無為，此則究竟到於彼岸，亦名到彼岸慧，以歷多時故名為漸。	Although the gradual [approach] suddenly illuminates the emptiness of dharmas, yet it is cultivated and becomes one's nature, and one spontaneously clings [to things]. Therefore, it spurs the wisdom of sudden enlightenment to be aware of deluded emotions, to diminish them again and again until reaching non-action. This is ultimately reaching the other shore, also called the wisdom of reaching the other shore, because it takes many times [to reach].
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c11_12']	漸之與頓遲速雖殊，一種得名到彼岸慧。	漸之與頓遲速雖殊，一種得名到彼岸慧。	Although the gradual and sudden [approaches] differ in speed, they are both called the wisdom of reaching the other shore.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c11_19']	所以具足合云：	所以具足合云：	Therefore, they are fully combined as follows:
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c12_7']	金剛般若波羅蜜。	金剛般若波羅蜜。	Diamond Prajñāpāramitā.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c12_13']	今略不言也。	今略不言也。	Now it is abbreviated and not mentioned.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c13_3']	次明經字具三義者。	次明經字具三義者。	Next, clarifying that the word sūtra has three meanings.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c14_9']	然準諸家解釋，共有多義，謂湧泉、出生、繩墨、結鬘之類。	然準諸家解釋，共有多義，謂湧泉、出生、繩墨、結鬘之類。	However, according to the explanations of various masters, there are many meanings, such as springing up, giving birth, string, and garland.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c15_5']	若《佛地論》中唯說二義，謂貫也、攝也。	若《佛地論》中唯說二義，謂貫也、攝也。	If in the Buddha Land Treatise, only two meanings are explained, namely penetrating and embracing.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c15_19']	貫穿所應說義，攝持所化眾生。	貫穿所應說義，攝持所化眾生。	It penetrates the meaning that should be spoken, and embraces the sentient beings to be transformed.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c17_9']	且如來入滅二千餘年遺風若存，得聞正法者，斯皆經之貫穿之義也。	且如來入滅二千餘年遺風若存，得聞正法者，斯皆經之貫穿之義也。	For example, more than two thousand years have passed since the Tathāgata's nirvāṇa, yet his legacy remains. Those who have heard the true Dharma have all been guided by the penetrating meaning of the sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c19_1']	眾生流浪莫知所從，得佛教門咸歸正趣者，斯皆經之攝持之義也。	眾生流浪莫知所從，得佛教門咸歸正趣者，斯皆經之攝持之義也。	Sentient beings wander aimlessly, not knowing where they come from. Those who have received the Buddha's teachings and all return to the right path have all been guided by the encompassing meaning of the sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c19_10']	具此二義故名為經。	具此二義故名為經。	Because it possesses these two meanings, it is called a sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c20_20']	今以此二復加常義，以對三種般若，謂實相常、觀照貫、文字攝也。	今以此二復加常義，以對三種般若，謂實相常、觀照貫、文字攝也。	Now, these two are further added with the meaning of permanence, corresponding to the three kinds of prajñā, namely, the permanence of the true aspect, the penetration of contemplation, and the encompassing of the written word.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c22_17']	然此一經羅什所譯，句偈清潤令人樂聞，至今長幼高卑盈於寰宇，靡不受持此經也。	然此一經羅什所譯，句偈清潤令人樂聞，至今長幼高卑盈於寰宇，靡不受持此經也。	However, this single sūtra was translated by Kumārajīva, with clear and flowing phrases and verses that delight the listener. Up to now, the young and old, the noble and humble, fill the world, and none do not uphold this sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c23_12']	疏論纂要者，即此一卷疏文也。	疏論纂要者，即此一卷疏文也。	The Collected Essentials of the Commentary and Treatise is this single fascicle of commentary.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c24_6']	疏即青龍大雲、資聖塵外等疏。	疏即青龍大雲、資聖塵外等疏。	The commentary refers to the commentaries by Qinglong Dayun, Zisheng Chenwai, and others.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c25_4']	疏謂疎通理趣、決擇義相、布致文言也。	疏謂疎通理趣、決擇義相、布致文言也。	A commentary is to clarify the principles, discern the meanings, and arrange the words.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0170c26_17']	論即天親、無著《智度》、《金剛仙》、《功德施》等論，一一論中任運議於理智行也。	論即天親、無著《智度》、《金剛仙》、《功德施》等論，一一論中任運議於理智行也。	The treatises are those by Vasubandhu, Asanga, the Diamond Prajñāpāramitā, and the treatises by Guṇadatta, etc., each of which naturally discusses the principle, wisdom, and practice.

['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176b26_4']	「無我相人相」等，即我空也。	「無我相人相」等，即我空也。	No characteristics of self, no characteristics of person, and so on, is the emptiness of self.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176b26_19']	「我相即是非相」等，即法空也。	「我相即是非相」等，即法空也。	The characteristics of self are not characteristics, and so on, is the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176b27_12']	「離一切相即名諸佛」，是俱空也。	「離一切相即名諸佛」，是俱空也。	Departing from all characteristics is called the buddhas, is the emptiness of both.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176b27_17']	二空可知。	二空可知。	The two emptinesses can be understood.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176b28_2']	俱空有三說：	俱空有三說：	There are three explanations for the emptiness of both:
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176b29_4']	一別觀人法名二空，同一剎那雙觀人法曰俱空。	一別觀人法名二空，同一剎那雙觀人法曰俱空。	First, separately contemplating persons and dharmas is called the two emptinesses, but simultaneously contemplating persons and dharmas in the same instant is called the emptiness of both.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176b29_19']	二即二執既遣，二空亦遣名俱空。	二即二執既遣，二空亦遣名俱空。	Second, once the two attachments are dispelled, the two emptinesses are also dispelled, which is called the emptiness of both.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c01_17']	三即能所遣時慧亦無住，即與本性相應。	三即能所遣時慧亦無住，即與本性相應。	Third, when the able and the so are dispelled, wisdom also has no abiding, and is then in accord with the fundamental nature.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c02_16']	此時自無人、法二相及非法相等名俱空。	此時自無人、法二相及非法相等名俱空。	At this time, there are naturally no characteristics of either persons or dharmas, nor any characteristics of non-dharmas, which is called the emptiness of both.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c03_2']	徹謂透徹。	徹謂透徹。	Penetrate means to penetrate through.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c03_13']	慧是能徹，三空是所徹。	慧是能徹，三空是所徹。	Wisdom is the able, and the three emptinesses are the so.

['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c06_8']	以本心源非空非有，為對人執方說人空，為對法執方說法空，為對二執方說俱空。	以本心源非空非有，為對人執方說人空，為對法執方說法空，為對二執方說俱空。	Because the original mind-source is neither empty nor existent, it is taught as the emptiness of person in response to the grasping of person, it is taught as the emptiness of phenomena in response to the grasping of phenomena, and it is taught as the emptiness of both in response to the grasping of both.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c08_12']	即空是能對、執為所對，所對之執既遣，能對之空亦除，空執兩亡方契本性，若住空境未曰相應。	即空是能對、執為所對，所對之執既遣，能對之空亦除，空執兩亡方契本性，若住空境未曰相應。	Emptiness is the means of response, and grasping is what is responded to. Once the grasping that is responded to is eliminated, the emptiness that is the means of response is also removed. Only when both grasping and emptiness are gone can one accord with the original nature. If one abides in the realm of emptiness, it is not yet called accord.

['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c13_15']	「若時於所緣，智都無所得，爾時住唯識，離二取相故。	「若時於所緣，智都無所得，爾時住唯識，離二取相故。	When at that time there is nothing at all attained by cognition in regard to the objective realm, at that time one abides in consciousness-only, because the characteristics of the two graspings are absent.

['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c17_11']	以布施舍於三施，三施該於六度，六度包於萬行，以本望末故，曰檀舍萬行也。	以布施舍於三施，三施該於六度，六度包於萬行，以本望末故，曰檀舍萬行也。	By giving, one gives to the three kinds of giving. The three kinds of giving encompass the six perfections, and the six perfections include the myriad practices. By looking at the end from the beginning, it is said that giving embraces the myriad practices.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c18_3']	所以佛答修行，唯言布施。	所以佛答修行，唯言布施。	Therefore, when the Buddha answered about cultivation, he only mentioned giving.

['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c25_19']	以經中都無十八住名，含有十八住義，以不顯配故云密示。	以經中都無十八住名，含有十八住義，以不顯配故云密示。	Because the sutra does not have the name eighteen abodes, but contains the meaning of the eighteen abodes, it is said to be secretly indicated because it is not explicitly matched.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0176c26_11']	前後淺深不同故云階差也。	前後淺深不同故云階差也。	It is said to be the levels and differences because the shallow and deep differences before and after are not the same.

Because of this, the text arises alone, with a sense of cutting off abruptly, and when investigating the meaning of the sūtra, there is a reason for everything. Although the text is not manifested, the principle is still connected. Because it is not clear, it is called latent communication.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0177a07_1']	其猶人身血脈，外雖不彰內宛流注，約喻顯法，故曰潛通血脈也。	其猶人身血脈，外雖不彰內宛流注，約喻顯法，故曰潛通血脈也。	It is like the blood vessels in the human body. Although they are not manifested externally, they flow internally. Using the metaphor to illustrate the Dharma, it is called the latent communication of blood vessels.

['ZH_T33_1702_001:0177a09_10']	謂二執為所遣，二空為能遣。	謂二執為所遣，二空為能遣。	It means that the two kinds of grasping are what is to be sent away, and the two kinds of emptiness are what can send them away.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0177a10_3']	又二空為所遣，俱空為能遣。	又二空為所遣，俱空為能遣。	Moreover, the two kinds of emptiness are what is to be sent away, and the emptiness of both is what can send them away.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0177a10_20']	以俱空遣二空，空病亦空，故云遣遣。	以俱空遣二空，空病亦空，故云遣遣。	By using the emptiness of both to send away the two kinds of emptiness, the sickness of emptiness is also emptied, thus it is called sending away the sender.

Because of firmly upholding the mind of detachment, the mind that is like an illusion is also far removed, the illusion of detachment is also far removed, and the illusion of detachment from detachment is also far removed.

Now, since there are no sentient beings to be saved, no giving that abides, no Dharma to be expounded, and no self that cultivates goodness, it accords with the sutra's main theme of the meaning of no characteristics. The sutra discusses this from beginning to end, hence it is said to be from beginning to end.
['ZH_T33_1702_001:0177a26_8']	又因心果心咸皆如是，斯則正策修時無相，正無相處策修，非謂前後始終皆爾。	又因心果心咸皆如是，斯則正策修時無相，正無相處策修，非謂前後始終皆爾。	Moreover, the causal mind and the resultant mind are all like this. This means that at the time of precisely encouraging cultivation, there are no characteristics, and in the very place of no characteristics, one encourages cultivation.
