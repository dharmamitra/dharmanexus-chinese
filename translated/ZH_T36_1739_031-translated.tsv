These two dharmas are not within the reach of the wisdom of bodhisattvas, and are only clarified upon the completion of the Buddha's fruition.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0933c26_15']	以理智法身但與行作無依之體達妄情之緣，其行中所感功德之相，即屬普賢行成。	以理智法身但與行作無依之體達妄情之緣，其行中所感功德之相，即屬普賢行成。	The wisdom and principle of the Dharma body merely serve as the supportless essence of practice and the condition for penetrating false emotions. The characteristics of merits and virtues that are aroused within the practice belong to Samantabhadra's accomplished practice.

The Following Good Light Merit Chapter is the merit of the self-nature and non-reliance of the Dharma body and wisdom body. These two Dharmas are both not attained by relying on practice, because they are not reached by the practice of Samantabhadra, but only because they serve as the basis for practice. They are the Dharma of the final stage of the Buddha fruit when the practice of Samantabhadra is fulfilled. Therefore, the Tathāgata himself explains, clarifying the Dharma gates of his own stage to be explained by himself in the future stage, so as to prevent confusion for later learners.

It is still announced by the sound of the formless light celestial drum. It still explains the wondrous principle of formlessness of the Dharma body, suddenly ascending to the stage of the tenth ground and the merit of leaving defilements. Therefore,

This is the eternal Buddha fruit of all bodhisattva practices, therefore, the Thus-Come One himself explains it.

['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c10_3', 'ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c11_16']	第一說光明所因從何所來者、從如來自體性自清淨法身根本無依住智自性清淨功德所生、能成相好無所依止、故名〈隨好光明功德品〉。🔽此之光明一切眾生同共有之，為不以普賢行願助揚顯發，不顯現普賢行願。	第一說光明所因從何所來者、從如來自體性自清淨法身根本無依住智自性清淨功德所生、能成相好無所依止、故名〈隨好光明功德品〉。 此之光明一切眾生同共有之，為不以普賢行願助揚顯發，不顯現普賢行願。	The first explanation is of the cause of the light and where it comes from. It comes from the Tathāgata's own essence, the intrinsically pure Dharma body, the fundamental non-abiding wisdom, the intrinsically pure merit and virtue, which gives rise to the ability to accomplish the major and minor marks without relying on anything. Therefore, it is called the Chapter on the Merits and Virtues of the Light of the Minor Marks.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c13_9']	不以此光明體，亦不能得成法界無限大用，是故此經名為覺行互嚴經。	不以此光明體，亦不能得成法界無限大用，是故此經名為覺行互嚴經。	This light is equally possessed by all sentient beings. If it is not assisted and revealed by the practices and vows of Samantabhadra, it does not manifest. The essence of this light also cannot accomplish the unlimited great functions of the Dharma realm. Therefore, this sūtra is called the Sūtra on the Mutual Adornment of Enlightenment and Practice.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c14_6']	至此二行圓滿，遂乃各各自顯其功。	至此二行圓滿，遂乃各各自顯其功。	When these two practices are perfected, they each reveal their own merits.

['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c16_15']	此品隨好光明，是佛自果無作法身無依住根本智光，是佛自說。	此品隨好光明，是佛自果無作法身無依住根本智光，是佛自說。	In this chapter, the light of the minor marks and radiance is the Buddha's own fruition, the fundamentally non-abiding wisdom light of the unconditioned Dharma body, and so the Buddha himself explains it.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c17_16']	但依教主以取經意，舉光之中其隨好光無量。	但依教主以取經意，舉光之中其隨好光無量。	However, based on the teacher of the teaching to grasp the meaning of the sūtra, among the lights, the light of the minor marks is immeasurable.

['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c22_13']	別舉此光中隨用，云此隨好中出大光明名為熾盛，此明隨用能破迷惑。	別舉此光中隨用，云此隨好中出大光明名為熾盛，此明隨用能破迷惑。	Specifically mentioning the use of this light, it says that from this minor mark emerges a great light called Fierce, which clarifies that this use is able to destroy delusion.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c23_15']	七百萬阿僧祇光明而為眷屬者，此明隨用備根。	七百萬阿僧祇光明而為眷屬者，此明隨用備根。	With 700,000 asaṃkhyeya lights as its retinue, this clarifies that this use is equipped with faculties.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c24_10']	七百都數約七菩提分息六道苦。	七百都數約七菩提分息六道苦。	The number 700 is based on the seven factors of enlightenment and the cessation of the suffering of the six paths.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c25_14']	乃為七百者，數之長也，皆令發起一乘中十地道故。	乃為七百者，數之長也，皆令發起一乘中十地道故。	It is called 700 because the number is long, all causing the arising of the ten grounds within the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c26_13']	為此光體是佛果光，光所及者皆依本故。	為此光體是佛果光，光所及者皆依本故。	This is because the essence of this light is the light of the Buddha's fruition, and those reached by the light all rely on the basis.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c27_9']	又約八地已前有行有開發為七百。	又約八地已前有行有開發為七百。	Moreover, it is based on the seven grounds and below, which have practice and development, as 700.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c27_15']	萬者，萬行。	萬者，萬行。	Myriad refers to myriad practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0934c28_7']	阿僧祇者，明光體備根遍周。	阿僧祇者，明光體備根遍周。	Asamkhyeya clarifies that the light's essence is complete and pervades everywhere.

The sentient beings in the hells had their sufferings cease and attained the ten kinds of purity of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. They abandoned their hellish bodies and were reborn in Tuṣita Heaven. Hearing the sound of the celestial drum expounding the Dharma, they attained the stainless samādhi and gave rise to the ten grounds.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0935a05_4']	此明光照往因十信解心修力不固，有因放逸生惡道者，遇光苦息三業復本。	此明光照往因十信解心修力不固，有因放逸生惡道者，遇光苦息三業復本。	This clarifies that the light illuminates the past causes. The minds of the ten faiths and understandings cultivated by the power of practice are not firm. There are those who give rise to evil paths due to negligence. When they encounter the light, their sufferings cease and their three karmas return to their original state.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0935a05_11']	此明三生成果。	此明三生成果。	This clarifies the three lives forming the fruition.
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0935a06_10']	第一生修十信解心，心不精專作諸惡業；	第一生修十信解心，心不精專作諸惡業；	In the first life, they cultivate the minds of the ten faiths and understandings, but their minds are not focused and they commit evil deeds;
['ZH_T36_1739_031:0935a07_2']	第二生生惡道住地獄中；	第二生生惡道住地獄中；	In the second life, they are reborn in the evil paths and dwell in the hells;

['ZH_T36_1739_031:0935a12_9']	如輪王第一夫人所生大子具輪王相，雖未當位是王真種，體無差別。	如輪王第一夫人所生大子具輪王相，雖未當位是王真種，體無差別。	It is like the eldest son born to the chief consort of a wheel-turning king who possesses the marks of a wheel-turning king.

Even those in Avīci Hell who experience uninterrupted suffering, upon encountering this light, are all reborn in Tuṣita Heaven. The heavenly drum's resonant sound expounds the Dharma, and through repentance and removal of afflictions, one attains the samādhi of being free from defilements or the samādhi of the seal of non-reliance.

Therefore, only forty lights are emitted, not fifty.

By nature it is free from defilements, endowed with infinite wisdom, knowledge, and insight, and has no self-attachment. It must be aroused through skillful means and samādhi in order to become clear, like Dharma Wisdom Bodhisattva entering the samādhi of immeasurable skillful means. It is also like Sudhana attaining the wisdom and light of all buddhas on Mount Marvelous Peak. All of this is because the initial mind of the ten abodes first begins to manifest.
