At that time, it is like a wise painter in the world who does not grasp them as having true self-nature. Unlike the previously mentioned conditioned and unconditioned objects, one does not wrap oneself in them like a silkworm in a cocoon, because they do not exist. Non-discriminating wisdom enters and is accomplished.
