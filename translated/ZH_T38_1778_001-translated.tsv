['ZH_T38_1778_001:0562c21_27']	一、明經度不盡；	一、明經度不盡；	1. Clarifying that the sūtra is not complete;

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0562c23_20']	尋經文義，西土猶多。	尋經文義，西土猶多。	If one examines the text and meaning of the sūtra, there is still much more in the Western Regions.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0562c24_4']	何以知之？	何以知之？	How can this be known?
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0562c26_3']	如命十弟子，如是五百乃至八千，各辭不堪，不堪之言並不來此，推此而論經卷不少。	如命十弟子，如是五百乃至八千，各辭不堪，不堪之言並不來此，推此而論經卷不少。	For example, the sūtra instructs the ten disciples, and so on for five hundred, up to eight thousand, each declining the task. The words of their declinations are not all found in this version. Based on this, we can infer that the sūtra scroll is not short.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0562c27_17']	又文殊入室傳如來旨，慇懃無量，兼八千菩薩各說入門，此諸言談何止半卷？	又文殊入室傳如來旨，慇懃無量，兼八千菩薩各說入門，此諸言談何止半卷？	Moreover, when Mañjuśrī entered the room to convey the Tathāgata's message, there were countless earnest entreaties, along with the eight thousand bodhisattvas each explaining their entryway. How could these discussions be only half a scroll?
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0562c29_14']	爰至出室詣菴羅園，對揚如來辨佛國義，當時敷演高論往復，豈容止有數紙經文？	爰至出室詣菴羅園，對揚如來辨佛國義，當時敷演高論往復，豈容止有數紙經文？	From the time of leaving the room to going to the Amrapali Grove, where he expounded the meaning of the Buddha land in response to the Tathagata, at that time he expounded the lofty discussion back and forth. How could it be allowed to have only a few sheets of sutra text?
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a02_14']	意謂振旦生民神根狹劣，不堪具足讀誦受持，刪彼富文採其綱格流傳茲土，略存義焉。	意謂振旦生民神根狹劣，不堪具足讀誦受持，刪彼富文採其綱格流傳茲土，略存義焉。	I think that the people of China have narrow and inferior spiritual faculties, and are unable to fully read, recite, and uphold it. I have deleted the rich text and selected the main points to spread in this land, briefly preserving the meaning.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a06_15']	故論云「般若有二種，一共二乘說、二不共二乘說。	故論云「般若有二種，一共二乘說、二不共二乘說。	Therefore the treatise says, Prajna has two kinds: one is taught in common with the two vehicles, and the other is not taught in common with the two vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a07_5']	不共說者，如不思議經。	不共說者，如不思議經。	The teaching not in common with the two vehicles is like the inconceivable sutra.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a07_23']	」故《華嚴》云「此經不入二乘人手」。	」故《華嚴》云「此經不入二乘人手」。	Therefore the Flower Ornament Sutra says, This sutra does not fall into the hands of those in the two vehicles.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a11_1']	此經既有兩名，豈獨《華嚴》更無別稱？	此經既有兩名，豈獨《華嚴》更無別稱？	Since this sūtra has two names, how can the Huayan Sūtra be the only one without another title?

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a14_1']	如說謳舍那優婆夷為須達那菩薩說度眾生數量，乃是《華嚴》明善才入法界所聞之事；	如說謳舍那優婆夷為須達那菩薩說度眾生數量，乃是《華嚴》明善才入法界所聞之事；	For example, it says that the upāsikā Audāriṇī spoke to the bodhisattva Sudāna about the number of sentient beings to be saved, which is the matter heard by Shancai when he entered the Dharma realm in the Huayan Sūtra;
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a14_17']	若引此經，即云「毘摩羅詰所說」。	若引此經，即云「毘摩羅詰所說」。	If this sūtra is cited, it says spoken by Vimalakīrti.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a18_2']	而肇師云「始于淨土終法供養，其間所明雖殊，不思議一也。	而肇師云「始于淨土終法供養，其間所明雖殊，不思議一也。	However, Master ZHAO said, Beginning with the Pure Land and ending with the Dharma offering, although what is explained in between is different, the inconceivable is one.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a19_11']	」是則寶積發問已前為序，〈囑累〉一品以為流通，其間並是正說也。	」是則寶積發問已前為序，〈囑累〉一品以為流通，其間並是正說也。	This means that what is before the question asked by Baoji is the introduction, and the chapter on entrusting is regarded as the dissemination, and what is in between is all the main explanation.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a20_19']	次靈味小亮云「此經題既云淨名所說，從〈方便品〉皆是正說。	次靈味小亮云「此經題既云淨名所說，從〈方便品〉皆是正說。	Next, Lingwei Xiaoliang said, Since the title of this sutra says it is spoken by Jingming, from the chapter on skillful means it is all the main explanation.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a25_6']	晚三論師亦同此釋。	晚三論師亦同此釋。	The later Sanlun masters also explain it in the same way.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a28_3']	但古今不同互有分別，承習之者各有宗門。	但古今不同互有分別，承習之者各有宗門。	However, the ancient and modern masters differ in their interpretations, each with their own perspective. Those who follow them each have their own school.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563a29_10']	諸禪師見此分別多延紛諍，不開科節，但約觀門直明入道。	諸禪師見此分別多延紛諍，不開科節，但約觀門直明入道。	The Chan masters see that these interpretations lead to much dispute, so they do not divide the text but simply discuss the path of practice based on the contemplation methods.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b02_11']	次明今家者，若不開科段則不識起盡佛教承躡，若開科段執諍紛然於解脫之法橫生繫累；	次明今家者，若不開科段則不識起盡佛教承躡，若開科段執諍紛然於解脫之法橫生繫累；	Next, for the present master, if the sections are not divided, then the beginning and end of the Buddha's teachings cannot be discerned. If the sections are divided, then disputes arise and one becomes entangled in the Dharma of liberation.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b03_8']	今尋經意趣傍經開科，而非固執。	今尋經意趣傍經開科，而非固執。	Now, seeking the meaning of the sutra and following the sutra to divide the sections, but not being rigidly attached to it.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b07_16']	序者，大聖將欲說法，必先現瑞表發以為由藉。	序者，大聖將欲說法，必先現瑞表發以為由藉。	As for the introduction, the Great Sage, before expounding the Dharma, must first manifest auspicious signs to serve as the basis.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b09_3']	如欲說《大品》即放支節雜色之光，表欲說般若以導諸行；	如欲說《大品》即放支節雜色之光，表欲說般若以導諸行；	If he wishes to expound the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, he emits light of various colors from his limbs, indicating his intention to expound prajñā to guide all practices;
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b10_1']	欲說《法華》放眉間光，表欲說中道實相；	欲說《法華》放眉間光，表欲說中道實相；	If he wishes to expound the Lotus Sūtra, he emits light from between his eyebrows, indicating his intention to expound the true reality of the Middle Way;
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b10_16']	今經合蓋現土，表欲說佛國因果。	今經合蓋現土，表欲說佛國因果。	In this sūtra, he covers the ground with a canopy, indicating his intention to expound the causes and effects of the Buddha's land.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b12_11']	既由藉不同，正表教門赴機有異，發起物情使咸信慕，歸宗有在，故曰序也。	既由藉不同，正表教門赴機有異，發起物情使咸信慕，歸宗有在，故曰序也。	Since the bases are not the same, the main text indicates that the teachings respond to capacities differently, inspiring beings to all have faith and admiration, and return to the essential. Therefore, it is called the introduction.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b13_17']	二、正說者，四眾覩瑞悉皆忻仰堪聞聖旨，大聖知時赴機設教。	二、正說者，四眾覩瑞悉皆忻仰堪聞聖旨，大聖知時赴機設教。	Second, as for the main teaching, the four assemblies, upon seeing the auspicious signs, all joyfully look up, able to hear the holy purport. The Great Sage, knowing the time, responds to capacities and establishes the teaching.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b14_13']	時眾聞經咸沾法利，故名正說也。	時眾聞經咸沾法利，故名正說也。	At that time, the assembly heard the sūtra and all received the benefits of the Dharma, thus it is called the correct teaching.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b17_7']	如來大慈平等說法，非止但為現在，亦欲遠被正像末代有緣，使咸沾法潤。	如來大慈平等說法，非止但為現在，亦欲遠被正像末代有緣，使咸沾法潤。	The Tathāgata's great compassion and impartial teaching of the Dharma is not only for the present, but also wishes to reach far to those with affinity in the true, semblance, and final ages, causing them all to receive the moisture of the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b18_7']	是則法水流霔無窮並沾斯澤，故名流通也。	是則法水流霔無窮並沾斯澤，故名流通也。	This means that the flowing and pouring of the Dharma water is inexhaustible, and all receive this grace, thus it is called circulation.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b20_3']	此於正說由藉義足，名為序分。	此於正說由藉義足，名為序分。	This, in the correct teaching, is based on the meaning of sufficiency, and is called the introduction section.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b22_16']	二、從寶積請問佛國因果已去訖〈阿閦佛〉有十一品半，皆明不思議解脫佛國因果，皆是赴機之教，現在沾益，並為正說。	二、從寶積請問佛國因果已去訖〈阿閦佛〉有十一品半，皆明不思議解脫佛國因果，皆是赴機之教，現在沾益，並為正說。	Second, from the question by Ratnākara on the causes and effects of the Buddha's land up to the Akṣobhya Buddha chapter, which is one and a half chapters, they all clarify the inconceivable liberation and the causes and effects of the Buddha's land, and are all teachings in response to capacities, benefiting the present, and are all correct teachings.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b25_1']	三、從〈法供養〉訖〈囑累〉，明天帝發誓弘經，如來印可，勸發囑累宣通未來，使流傳不絕，此並囑流通也。	三、從〈法供養〉訖〈囑累〉，明天帝發誓弘經，如來印可，勸發囑累宣通未來，使流傳不絕，此並囑流通也。	Third, from the chapter on Dharma Offerings to the chapter on Entrustment, it shows that the Heavenly Emperor vows to spread the sutra, the Tathagata approves, encourages and entrusts the spread in the future, causing it to be transmitted without interruption. This is all about entrusting the spread.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563b29_3']	譬如國王勅臣布政，布政有功而臣受賞，正命之主歸於國王，受功之名而臣受稱。	譬如國王勅臣布政，布政有功而臣受賞，正命之主歸於國王，受功之名而臣受稱。	It is like a king ordering a minister to implement governance. If the governance is effective, the minister receives rewards. The correct order is attributed to the king, but the minister receives the name of receiving the merit.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563c01_4']	不可謂臣受賞而臣為正，君垂正命而翻為傍。	不可謂臣受賞而臣為正，君垂正命而翻為傍。	It cannot be said that the minister receives rewards and the minister is the main, while the king's correct order becomes secondary.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0563c04_15']	二觀方便即是序義，得入中道即是正義，雙照二諦心心寂滅自然流入即流通義。	二觀方便即是序義，得入中道即是正義，雙照二諦心心寂滅自然流入即流通義。	The two contemplations and skillful means are the meaning of the preface, entering the middle way is the meaning of the main text, and the simultaneous illumination of the two truths, with each thought naturally flowing into cessation, is the meaning of the circulation.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566b17_1']	一、染淨土說教不同者，凡聖同居既有淨穢，穢者五濁障重而根有利鈍，利感頓教，譬如日出前照高山；	一、染淨土說教不同者，凡聖同居既有淨穢，穢者五濁障重而根有利鈍，利感頓教，譬如日出前照高山；	First, the differences in teaching the defiled and pure lands. Since there is purity and impurity in the shared abode of ordinary beings and sages, the defiled ones have heavy hindrances of the five turbidities and sharp and dull faculties. The sharp ones are inspired by sudden teachings, like the sun rising first illuminating the high mountains;
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566b18_19']	鈍根障重，即開三藏、方等、大品方便調伏，於法華、涅槃始聞圓教，見於佛性開祕密藏。	鈍根障重，即開三藏、方等、大品方便調伏，於法華、涅槃始聞圓教，見於佛性開祕密藏。	The dull faculties and heavy hindrances are then opened to the three treasuries, the vast sutras, and the expedient methods of taming, and only hear the perfect teachings in the Lotus Sutra and Nirvana Sutra, seeing the Buddha-nature and opening the secret treasury.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566b20_5']	淨者，如華光土，雖非惡世，願說三乘，此亦得有頓漸之教。	淨者，如華光土，雖非惡世，願說三乘，此亦得有頓漸之教。	The pure ones, like the land of Flower Light, although not in a bad world, vow to expound the three vehicles, and this also has sudden and gradual teachings.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566b21_12']	本願說故。	本願說故。	Because it is explained in the original vow.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566b24_4']	藏通二乘皆鈍，故《大論》明羅漢法性身鈍，以於佛道而紆迴故。	藏通二乘皆鈍，故《大論》明羅漢法性身鈍，以於佛道而紆迴故。	The two vehicles of the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings are both dull, so the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra clarifies that the Dharma-nature body of arhats is dull, because it takes detours in the Buddha's path.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566b26_4']	通別圓教迭判利鈍可知，如來於彼但說一乘，雖無開三，而於一乘不無權別赴兩機緣。	通別圓教迭判利鈍可知，如來於彼但說一乘，雖無開三，而於一乘不無權別赴兩機緣。	The sharp and dull distinctions of the Distinct, Shared, and Perfect Teachings can be understood. The Tathāgata there only expounds the One Vehicle. Although there is no disclosure of the three, within the One Vehicle there are still provisional distinctions to accord with the two kinds of capacities.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566b28_11']	若明開顯，雖無藏通而開別權顯圓之實，故《法華》明羅漢生彼求佛智慧，得聞是經，唯以佛乘而得滅度。	若明開顯，雖無藏通而開別權顯圓之實，故《法華》明羅漢生彼求佛智慧，得聞是經，唯以佛乘而得滅度。	If clarifying the disclosure and revelation, although there are no Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings, the provisional of the Distinct is disclosed and the true of the Perfect is revealed. Therefore, the Lotus Sūtra clarifies that arhats reborn there seek the Buddha's wisdom, and upon hearing this sūtra, they attain nirvāṇa solely through the Buddha Vehicle.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c01_17']	三、明果報土說教不同者，既皆破無明，其往生者同一根性，行大直道無復紆迴，佛於彼土但說一圓也。	三、明果報土說教不同者，既皆破無明，其往生者同一根性，行大直道無復紆迴，佛於彼土但說一圓也。	Third, regarding the different teachings expounded in the Land of Recompensed Form, since they all break through ignorance, those who are reborn there have the same fundamental nature, practice the great straight path without any detours, and the Buddha there only expounds the One Perfect [Teaching].
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c04_6']	四、常寂光國說教不同者，若究竟寂光，無說無示而言說者，法身無緣冥資一切，無說而說即是法身說法。	四、常寂光國說教不同者，若究竟寂光，無說無示而言說者，法身無緣冥資一切，無說而說即是法身說法。	Fourth, the differences in teaching in the eternally quiescent light land: If it is the ultimate eternally quiescent light, there is no speaking and no demonstration. As for speaking, the Dharma body mysteriously benefits all without conditions, speaking without speaking is precisely the Dharma body speaking the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c06_6']	若約果報明常寂光，分別二種說法不同者，說無作四諦即果報土，說一實諦即常寂光。	若約果報明常寂光，分別二種說法不同者，說無作四諦即果報土，說一實諦即常寂光。	If it is explained in terms of the land of recompense, the eternally quiescent light is distinguished into two kinds of speaking the Dharma differently. Speaking the four truths of non-action is precisely the land of recompense, speaking the one truth is precisely the eternally quiescent light.

Due to the conditions of ignorance, good and evil arise. The phenomena that are produced are empty, conventional, and the middle way.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c10_2']	中是因緣善惡之境，即凡聖同居。	中是因緣善惡之境，即凡聖同居。	The middle way is the realm of good and evil conditions, which is precisely the land of the common abode of ordinary beings and sages.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c10_14']	所觀善惡即淨穢土。	所觀善惡即淨穢土。	The observed good and evil are precisely the pure and defiled lands.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c11_13']	了因緣虛假折體入空，空境即是有餘土也。	了因緣虛假折體入空，空境即是有餘土也。	Understanding the emptiness of conditions, conventional, and breaking down into emptiness, the empty realm is precisely the land of remaining recompense.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c13_12']	知空非空不以為證，知中非因非果而因而果，若了因果無障礙者，即是果報無障礙土。	知空非空不以為證，知中非因非果而因而果，若了因果無障礙者，即是果報無障礙土。	Knowing emptiness is not emptiness is not considered a realization. Knowing the middle is neither cause nor effect, yet is cause and effect. If one understands cause and effect to be unobstructed, then the retribution is the unobstructed land.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c15_7']	雖復空假入出之殊，而無明心源即是佛性，若知無明性即是明，即常寂光。	雖復空假入出之殊，而無明心源即是佛性，若知無明性即是明，即常寂光。	Although there are differences in entering and exiting emptiness and conventionality, the source of the ignorant mind is precisely buddha-nature. If one knows the nature of ignorance is precisely illumination, then it is the eternally quiescent and illuminated [land].
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c17_8']	故文云「隨其心淨即佛土淨」，《大集》云「欲淨佛國，當淨汝心」，《華嚴》云「無量諸世界，悉從心緣起。	故文云「隨其心淨即佛土淨」，《大集》云「欲淨佛國，當淨汝心」，《華嚴》云「無量諸世界，悉從心緣起。	Therefore, the text says, In accordance with the purity of one's mind, the buddha land is purified. The Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra says, If you wish to purify the buddha land, you should purify your own mind. The Flower Ornament Sutra says, Immeasurable worlds all arise from the mind's conditions.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0566c27_4']	復土如故，求聲聞人得小乘益。	復土如故，求聲聞人得小乘益。	Again, the land is as before, those who seek the sravaka vehicle obtain the benefit of the Hinayana.

['ZH_T38_1778_001:0567a02_11']	若成依因，則具界內，結業未斷生同居淨，結業若斷即生有餘，若成佛時則二種眾生來生其國。	若成依因，則具界內，結業未斷生同居淨，結業若斷即生有餘，若成佛時則二種眾生來生其國。	If one accomplishes the dependent cause, then one possesses the internal bonds of the realm that have not yet been severed. One is born in the pure same-dwelling realm. If the bonds of the realm are severed, one is then born in the remaining realm. If one becomes a Buddha, then two kinds of beings will come to be born in their country.

If they reach the Lotus Sutra, they will further sever the separate delusions and be born in the reward ground. Later, when they become Buddhas, three kinds of beings will come to be born in their countries.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0567a06_16']	次通〈菩薩品〉，呵諸菩薩令斷無明則生寂光，後成妙覺之時一種眾生來生其國。	次通〈菩薩品〉，呵諸菩薩令斷無明則生寂光，後成妙覺之時一種眾生來生其國。	Next, applying to the chapter on bodhisattvas, reprimanding the bodhisattvas to sever ignorance, they will then be born in the quiescent light.

Vimalakīrti then manifests an empty room, saying that the lands of the Buddhas of the ten directions are all empty, so he manifests the room as empty.

The celestial maiden dwelling in the room for twelve years is the same as Vimalakīrti dwelling in the eternally quiescent land, which precisely assists in manifesting the meaning of the Buddha's land, thus saying the lands of the buddhas in the ten directions are always manifested in this room.

The great bodhisattvas each speak of entering the door, wishing to destroy the ignorance of the previous two lands and enter the land of recompense to abide in the eternally quiescent radiance.
['ZH_T38_1778_001:0567a20_3']	次通〈香積品〉，此室現眾香之淨國對娑婆之穢土，即是證成室內五品扶成佛說淨穢兩國。	次通〈香積品〉，此室現眾香之淨國對娑婆之穢土，即是證成室內五品扶成佛說淨穢兩國。	Next, it extends to the Chapter on Fragrant Accumulation, where this room manifests the pure lands of various fragrances in contrast to the defiled lands of Saha, which is the proof and support of the five chapters in the room to establish the Buddha's teachings of pure and defiled lands.
