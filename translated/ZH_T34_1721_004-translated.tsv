['ZH_T34_1721_004:0499a17_5']	所以然者，出家二眾專心道果，多獲禪定，故得四禪時謂得四果名增上慢。	所以然者，出家二眾專心道果，多獲禪定，故得四禪時謂得四果名增上慢。	The reason for this is that the two monastic assemblies focus their minds on the fruits of the Way, and often attain dhyāna concentration, so when they attain the four dhyānas they consider it to be the attainment of the four fruits and call it excessive pride.

['ZH_T34_1721_004:0499a28_2']	《注經》云「雖知無我而以無我為我，亦慢也」。	《注經》云「雖知無我而以無我為我，亦慢也」。	The commentary on the sutra says, Although they know there is no self, they take the absence of self as their self, which is also arrogance.

Since then, the Buddha has given predictions of Buddhahood to bodhisattvas who had been progressing directly to Buddhahood. In one lifetime, only these two people have been universally caused to become Buddhas, and thus the Buddha's vow has been fulfilled. This is proven by the passage quoted above from the Chapter on the Appearance of the Buddha.

This sutra is currently at the end of the Parable Chapter, therefore it says, Only abandoning false imagination is called liberation, but in reality one has not yet attained complete liberation.

The two vehicles existed before and do not exist now, so they are people with faults. Therefore the Nirvana Sutra says, If the Shravakas say there is no giving, then this is called breaking the precepts and having wrong views, which is the evidence.

The cause of retribution leads to the realms of humans and gods, while the cause of habit draws one to be born as a Buddha with the characteristics of a Buddha.

['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505b05_11']	《大品》明其近、不取其遠，故無所得善能動能出，有所得善不動不出。	《大品》明其近、不取其遠，故無所得善能動能出，有所得善不動不出。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra clarifies the near and does not take the far, so non-obtained wholesome goodness can move and come out, while obtained wholesome goodness is immovable and does not come out.

['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505b07_16']	一者習因，二者報因。	一者習因，二者報因。	First, habitual causes; second, retributive causes.

With habitual causes, one encounters buddhas and bodhisattvas, hears the teaching of the Great Vehicle, and gives rise to a moment of faith in non-attainment. This faith in non-attainment is the seed of the Buddha Way. Relying on previous attainment, the subsequent non-attainment is produced.
['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505b11_16']	故《智度論》云「有所得者是無所得初門」，故云是遠緣。	故《智度論》云「有所得者是無所得初門」，故云是遠緣。	Therefore, the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says, Attainment is the initial gateway to non-attainment. Therefore, it is said to be a distant condition.

['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505b14_17']	彼明一念善具二因，今明有所得善，前後相生義自是習因，感報之義是報因，此之習報並是不成佛。	彼明一念善具二因，今明有所得善，前後相生義自是習因，感報之義是報因，此之習報並是不成佛。	They clarify that a single moment of wholesome thought possesses two causes. Now, it is clarified that wholesome thoughts with attainment give rise to each other, and the meaning of this is the habitual cause. The meaning of giving rise to retribution is the retributive cause. This habitual and retributive [thought] is not becoming a buddha.
['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505b17_11']	故《法華論》釋「童子聚沙為佛塔皆已成佛」者，要是發菩提心方得成佛，非謂凡夫善根及決定聲聞善根得成佛也。	故《法華論》釋「童子聚沙為佛塔皆已成佛」者，要是發菩提心方得成佛，非謂凡夫善根及決定聲聞善根得成佛也。	Therefore, the Fahua lun explains that the children who gathered sand to make Buddha stupas have all already become Buddhas means that they must have given rise to the bodhi mind in order to become Buddhas, not that ordinary beings' wholesome roots or the wholesome roots of determined śrāvakas can become Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505b19_1']	《中論》云「雖復懃精進修行菩提道，若前非佛性終不得成佛」也。	《中論》云「雖復懃精進修行菩提道，若前非佛性終不得成佛」也。	The Zhong lun says, Although one may diligently practice the path to bodhi, if one's previous nature is not that of a Buddha, one will never become a Buddha.

['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505b22_9']	有所得若決定性者不能生無所得，良由諸法無決定性故，值佛菩薩悟此有所得本無所有便生無所得也。	有所得若決定性者不能生無所得，良由諸法無決定性故，值佛菩薩悟此有所得本無所有便生無所得也。	If those with attainment have a fixed nature, they cannot give rise to that without attainment. It is precisely because all dharmas have no fixed nature that encountering Buddhas and bodhisattvas, realizing that these wholesome roots with attainment are originally non-existent, one then gives rise to that without attainment.

['ZH_T34_1721_004:0505c08_10']	二者、舉人天乘破二乘保執義，佛言我以佛眼見過去，人天一念善根尚並已成佛竟，故知無有灰身滅智同於大虛畢竟永住二乘不成佛也。	二者、舉人天乘破二乘保執義，佛言我以佛眼見過去，人天一念善根尚並已成佛竟，故知無有灰身滅智同於大虛畢竟永住二乘不成佛也。	Second, using the vehicles of humans and gods to refute the two vehicles' attachment to their own views. The Buddha said, With my Buddha-eye, I see that even a single thought of wholesome roots in the past of humans and gods has already become buddhahood.

This sūtra clarifies the Buddha eye sees sentient beings based on causes and conditions. Therefore, the previous text has two meanings:

The Buddha has immeasurable skillful means. He sometimes says all are real, sometimes unreal, etc., in the four propositions. It should also be said that dharmas have no fixed nature, and because they follow sentient beings, he sometimes says they are seen, sometimes not seen, etc., in the four propositions.
