Because the three vehicles are lax, although the Buddha appears in the world and expounds the teachings of the three vehicles, one is attached to the rewards of pleasure and indulges in the five desires, not seeing the Buddha, not hearing the Dharma.

That is to say, initiating the gathering, initiating auspicious signs, and even initiating questions and answers, are all called the initiating assembly.
['ZH_T34_1718_02b:0026c17_4']	當機者，宿植德本，緣合時熟，如癰欲潰，不起于座，聞即得道，此名當機眾。	當機者，宿植德本，緣合時熟，如癰欲潰，不起于座，聞即得道，此名當機眾。	02b	The audience refers to those with past merits and virtues, whose conditions and circumstances are ripe, like a boil about to burst. Without rising from their seats, upon hearing the Dharma they attain the Way. This is called the audience.
['ZH_T34_1718_02b:0026c19_11']	影嚮者，古往諸佛、法身菩薩，隱其圓極，匡輔法王，如眾星繞月，雖無為作而有巨益，此名影嚮眾。	影嚮者，古往諸佛、法身菩薩，隱其圓極，匡輔法王，如眾星繞月，雖無為作而有巨益，此名影嚮眾。	02b	The shadow and echo refers to the Buddhas of the past and Dharma-body Bodhisattvas, who conceal their perfection and assist the Dharma King, like stars surrounding the moon. Although they do not create anything, they have great benefits. This is called the shadow and echo audience.

Yet their past roots are shallow, covered, leaking, and mixed, and the three wisdoms do not arise. In the present world, although they see the Buddha and hear the Dharma, they do not benefit from the four siddhāntas. They only create causes and conditions for future liberation. This is called the audience that forms karmic bonds.

The assembly that heard the Dharma and attained the Way is the assembly of those who were receptive at that time. Those who heard the Dharma but were not yet liberated and met each other in life after life, and those who now abide in the stage of the hearers, are the assembly of those with whom karmic bonds were formed at that time.
['ZH_T34_1718_02b:0026c28_2']	彼佛世時尚有四四十六眾，今佛道同，寧得無耶？	彼佛世時尚有四四十六眾，今佛道同，寧得無耶？	02b	Even in the time of that Buddha, there were still four groups of sixteen, and now that the Buddha's Way is the same, how could there be no such assembly?

Entering the stage of resemblance becomes the assembly of those who are receptive. Entering the stage of distinction becomes the assembly of those who are inspired and those who are in the background.
['ZH_T34_1718_02b:0027a04_15']	「圍遶」者，佛初出世，人未知法，淨居天下化為人像，到已右旋，旋已敬禮，禮已却坐聽法。	「圍遶」者，佛初出世，人未知法，淨居天下化為人像，到已右旋，旋已敬禮，禮已却坐聽法。	02b	Surrounding means that when the Buddha first appeared in the world, people did not yet know the Dharma.
