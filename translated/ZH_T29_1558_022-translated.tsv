When water is analyzed by wisdom into form and so forth, the cognition of water ceases. Fire and so forth are also like this.

Having heard them, one diligently seeks the teachings and their meanings. Having heard the teachings and their meanings, one reflects on them without error. Having reflected, one is then able to cultivate them in accordance with samādhi.
