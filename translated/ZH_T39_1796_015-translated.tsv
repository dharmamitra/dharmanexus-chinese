['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b02_10']	此菩提心即是第十一地成就最正覺。	此菩提心即是第十一地成就最正覺。	015	This bodhi mind is the eleventh ground, attaining perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b03_16']	如是悉地，諸地中最在其上，故經云彼悉地更無過上也。	如是悉地，諸地中最在其上，故經云彼悉地更無過上也。	015	Such an accomplishment is the highest among all the grounds, and therefore the sūtra says that accomplishment is unsurpassed.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b04_10']	次答入修行，是住信行地也。	次答入修行，是住信行地也。	015	Next, the answer to entering into practice is the stage of abiding in the practice of faith.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b05_4']	次昇於地位，謂越世間五神通。	次昇於地位，謂越世間五神通。	015	Next, ascending to the stage of the grounds means surpassing the five supernormal knowledges of the world.

['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b08_4']	一者信、二者入地、三者五通、四者二乘、五者成佛，此是五種悉地也。	一者信、二者入地、三者五通、四者二乘、五者成佛，此是五種悉地也。	015	The first is faith, second is entering the grounds, third is the five supernormal cognitive abilities, fourth is the two vehicles, and fifth is attaining Buddhahood. These are the five kinds of siddhi.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b09_10']	初信者，謂隨分能分淨諸根，深信如來祕藏，決定不疑。	初信者，謂隨分能分淨諸根，深信如來祕藏，決定不疑。	015	The first, faith, means being able to purify the faculties to some extent, deeply believing in the Tathāgata's secret treasury, and being without doubt.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b10_18']	信佛有如是如是方便，若依行者必成菩提，此是地前信行也。	信佛有如是如是方便，若依行者必成菩提，此是地前信行也。	015	Faith in the Buddha having such and such skillful means, if one practices accordingly, one will surely attain enlightenment. This is the stage of faith before the grounds.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b12_5']	次入地者，謂入初歡喜地也，准望聲聞法中猶如見諦人也。	次入地者，謂入初歡喜地也，准望聲聞法中猶如見諦人也。	015	Next, entering the grounds means entering the first ground of joy, which corresponds to the stage of seeing the truth in the śrāvaka teachings.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b14_11']	第三五通者，謂了知世間五通之境，猶如幻夢水月鏡像不可取著，爾時度五通仙人之地，名第三也。	第三五通者，謂了知世間五通之境，猶如幻夢水月鏡像不可取著，爾時度五通仙人之地，名第三也。	015	The third, the five supernormal cognitive abilities, means understanding the realm of the five supernormal cognitive abilities in the world to be like illusions, dreams, water moons, and mirror images, not to be grasped or attached to. At that time, one transcends the stage of the sage with the five supernormal cognitive abilities, which is called the third.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b16_13']	第四二乘者，謂觀察二乘境界，心得無著，心不墮實際，爾時得度二乘境界，爾時到第八地也。	第四二乘者，謂觀察二乘境界，心得無著，心不墮實際，爾時得度二乘境界，爾時到第八地也。	015	Fourth, the two vehicles refer to observing the realm of the two vehicles, the mind attains non-attachment, and the mind does not fall into reality. At that time, one transcends the realm of the two vehicles, and at that time one reaches the eighth ground.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b17_15']	五從第九地修菩提行道，轉轉勝進成如來位也。	五從第九地修菩提行道，轉轉勝進成如來位也。	015	Fifth, from the ninth ground, cultivating the path of bodhi, progressing further and further, one attains the stage of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b22_5']	然諸經論師大略皆作如此說爾，若祕藏中義復有異，謂初歡喜地自十心，從初心至第四心得度五通境界，從第五至第八心得度聲聞緣覺境界，從第九心一向行菩薩修道，至第十心名為成佛。	然諸經論師大略皆作如此說爾，若祕藏中義復有異，謂初歡喜地自十心，從初心至第四心得度五通境界，從第五至第八心得度聲聞緣覺境界，從第九心一向行菩薩修道，至第十心名為成佛。	015	However, the masters of various sūtras and śāstras generally explain it like this. If we discuss it from the perspective of the secret treasury, there are also differences. It is said that the first ground of joy has ten minds of its own. From the first mind to the fourth mind, one transcends the realm of the five supernatural powers. From the fifth to the eighth mind, one transcends the realm of the hearers and solitary realizers. From the ninth mind onward, one exclusively practices the bodhisattva path. The tenth mind is called attaining Buddhahood.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b23_5']	佛者覺也，謂覺自心性淨本來常寂滅相也。	佛者覺也，謂覺自心性淨本來常寂滅相也。	015	Buddha means enlightenment. It refers to being enlightened to the originally pure and eternally quiescent nature of one's own mind.

['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b26_4']	見觀謂見於諦理，此進修觀，謂一向觀於如來不思議界祕密功德。	見觀謂見於諦理，此進修觀，謂一向觀於如來不思議界祕密功德。	015	Seeing refers to seeing the truth, and contemplation refers to single-mindedly contemplating the inconceivable realm and secret merits of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b27_8']	如是祕密之境，非所見法，出過心量，故別名觀道也。	如是祕密之境，非所見法，出過心量，故別名觀道也。	015	Such a secret realm is not a visible dharma, transcending the realm of the mind, and thus it is separately called the path of contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738b28_13']	覺者是覺知義，已度二乘境界，了知二乘心與菩薩異也。	覺者是覺知義，已度二乘境界，了知二乘心與菩薩異也。	015	Awakening means the meaning of being aware and knowing. Having already transcended the realm of the two vehicles, one clearly knows that the mind of the two vehicles is different from that of the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c01_4']	若入第二地時，亦至第四心度五通，第八心度二乘，第十心成佛。	若入第二地時，亦至第四心度五通，第八心度二乘，第十心成佛。	015	When entering the second ground, one also reaches the fourth mind, surpassing the five supernatural powers, the eighth mind surpasses the two vehicles, and the tenth mind attains Buddhahood.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c02_14']	准此有信取入位名，與初地十心不異，但此十心轉復光顯離垢也。	准此有信取入位名，與初地十心不異，但此十心轉復光顯離垢也。	015	According to this, there are names for entering the stage with faith, which are no different from the ten minds of the first ground, but these ten minds turn and become more radiant, free from defilements.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c04_2']	乃至第十地亦有十心，即是凡有百心，一一轉勝可准知也。	乃至第十地亦有十心，即是凡有百心，一一轉勝可准知也。	015	Up to the tenth ground, there are also ten minds, which are a total of one hundred minds, each turning more excellent, which can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c04_17']	如《華嚴》真金之喻，可准知耳。	如《華嚴》真金之喻，可准知耳。	015	It is like the analogy of true gold in the Flower Ornament Sutra, which can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c05_17']	此初地十心滿，即能分身為百佛土等，如彼可知。	此初地十心滿，即能分身為百佛土等，如彼可知。	015	When these ten minds of the first ground are fulfilled, one can immediately manifest as hundreds of buddha lands and so forth, as can be known from that.

['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c07_17']	修實不息，令心心淨也。	修實不息，令心心淨也。	015	Cultivating without cessation causes mind after mind to be pure.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c08_11']	次答修行事業不息乃至心續淨。	次答修行事業不息乃至心續淨。	015	Next, it answers the question of not ceasing the practice of activities and so forth until the mind continues to be pure.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c09_21']	心續淨，謂不歇功用也，如是成熟謂不熟令成熟，當得於悉地也。	心續淨，謂不歇功用也，如是成熟謂不熟令成熟，當得於悉地也。	015	Mind continues to be pure means not resting in effort. In this way, it matures means causing the unripe to ripen, and one will attain siddhi.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c10_2']	亦可云彼當悉地。	亦可云彼當悉地。	015	It can also be said that they will attain siddhi.

['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c13_6']	」一時業生令寄在身，得持誦者悉地從意生，此生生世世是義語也。	」一時業生令寄在身，得持誦者悉地從意生，此生生世世是義語也。	015	At one time, karma arises and is entrusted to the body. For the mantra holder, siddhi arises from the mind. This from birth to birth, from life to life is a figurative expression.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c14_2']	梵云散跢那，是識也，謂內心中也。	梵云散跢那，是識也，謂內心中也。	015	Sādhana in Sanskrit means consciousness, referring to the inner mind.
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c16_1']	猶如世間眾生造種種業，乘此業故而受果報，或一生百千萬等生，此業不失，熟即受報。	猶如世間眾生造種種業，乘此業故而受果報，或一生百千萬等生，此業不失，熟即受報。	015	Just as in the world, sentient beings create various karmas, and by riding on these karmas they receive karmic retributions, either in one lifetime or in hundreds of thousands of lifetimes. These karmas are not lost, and when they ripen they receive their retributions.

Just as the practitioner, according to their superior, middling, or inferior aspirations, relies on the essentials of mantra methods to cultivate and attain siddhi,
['ZH_T39_1796_015:0738c18_16']	由此悉地在身故，乃至世世生生常在行人身中。	由此悉地在身故，乃至世世生生常在行人身中。	015	because of this siddhi being in the body, they will always be in the practitioner's body in lifetime after lifetime, birth after birth.

For all beings, at that time, the reciter is born from the cultivated pure wholesome karma. Next, the reciter attains accomplishment born from the mind, and the pure karma and the born mind are equal and without discrimination.
