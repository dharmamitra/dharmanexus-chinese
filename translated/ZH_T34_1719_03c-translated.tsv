['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209b29_17']	文自分二，初略中自二，初正釋中文自為三，初一從字訓，後二從意義。	文自分二，初略中自二，初正釋中文自為三，初一從字訓，後二從意義。	03c	The text is divided into two parts, the first is brief, and there are two parts in it. The first is the correct explanation, which is divided into three parts. The first one is based on the interpretation of the characters, and the last two are based on the meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c01_11']	又初二從昔教，後一屬今經。	又初二從昔教，後一屬今經。	03c	Moreover, the first two are based on the teachings of the past, and the last one belongs to the present sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c04_3']	雖有三釋，並以三教而為方便，但有能通非能通及以即不即異，致成三釋，然須略譚三種大旨，方可消文。	雖有三釋，並以三教而為方便，但有能通非能通及以即不即異，致成三釋，然須略譚三種大旨，方可消文。	03c	Although there are three explanations, they all use the three teachings as expedient means. There are only differences in being able to penetrate and not being able to penetrate, and in being immediate and not immediate, which lead to three explanations. However, it is necessary to briefly discuss the three main points in order to understand the text.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c08_15']	然於三中初約能用三教得名，法是所用、用是能用，雖法之與用俱通四教，但有方圓差會之殊，故方便之稱從權立名，權不即實故對昔辨，成體外權非今品意，文中舉圓即屬真實，相對來耳。	然於三中初約能用三教得名，法是所用、用是能用，雖法之與用俱通四教，但有方圓差會之殊，故方便之稱從權立名，權不即實故對昔辨，成體外權非今品意，文中舉圓即屬真實，相對來耳。	03c	However, among the three, the first is named based on the three teachings that are used, with the Dharma being what is used and the use being what is able to use. Although both the Dharma and its use pervade the four teachings, there is a difference between square and round. Therefore, the term skillful means is established based on the provisional. Since the provisional does not immediately accord with the real, it is distinguished from the past, forming the expedient means outside the essence, which is not the meaning of this chapter. In the text, the perfect is mentioned, which belongs to the true. It is only brought up in contrast.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c10_5']	故知在昔不應以祕妙釋方便也，乃是祕而不說名為方便。	故知在昔不應以祕妙釋方便也，乃是祕而不說名為方便。	03c	Therefore, it should be known that in the past, the secret and wonderful should not be explained as skillful means. It is the secret and unspoken that is called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c11_7']	況圓於昔乃是兼帶之圓，是故遍圓咸非今意。	況圓於昔乃是兼帶之圓，是故遍圓咸非今意。	03c	Moreover, the perfect in the past is the perfect with a hidden meaning. Therefore, the perfect in all aspects is not the meaning of this chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c14_8']	次第二釋權屬能通三教，亦得名為方便，然雖不即，以能為圓作遠詮故，所詮之圓亦帶能詮為方便故，故知並非今品意也。	次第二釋權屬能通三教，亦得名為方便，然雖不即，以能為圓作遠詮故，所詮之圓亦帶能詮為方便故，故知並非今品意也。	03c	Next, the second explanation of the provisional belongs to what is able to penetrate the three teachings, and is also called skillful means. Although it does not immediately accord, it is able to serve as the distant interpretation for the perfect. Therefore, the perfect that is interpreted also carries the able interpretation as skillful means. Therefore, it should be known that both are not the meaning of this chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c17_5']	前釋不云三為能者，權實逗會各致其極故方法不同，至第三釋方乃三權即是一實，指此即實之權，方名今經方便。	前釋不云三為能者，權實逗會各致其極故方法不同，至第三釋方乃三權即是一實，指此即實之權，方名今經方便。	03c	The previous explanation did not say that the three are the doer, because the provisional and the real correspond to their ultimate, and therefore the methods are not the same. Only in the third explanation is it said that the three provisional are one real. Pointing to this provisional that is the real is called the skillful means of this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c17_18']	次消文者，初約法用中為五：	次消文者，初約法用中為五：	03c	Next, in explaining the text, there are five points in the section on the function of the Dharma:

['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c23_16']	雖俱法用，以偏望圓，偏差圓會；	雖俱法用，以偏望圓，偏差圓會；	03c	Although both are methods, from the biased perspective of the perfect, the biased deviates from the perfect;
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c24_12']	會雖勝差，然會非差，用顯非妙。	會雖勝差，然會非差，用顯非妙。	03c	Although the perfect is superior to the biased, the perfect is not biased, and its function does not manifest as wondrous.

['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c26_3']	初釋法方圓，以對規矩而分偏圓，用顯非妙。	初釋法方圓，以對規矩而分偏圓，用顯非妙。	03c	First, explaining the square and round of the Dharma, using the square and round to distinguish the biased and perfect, to manifest that it is not wondrous.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c27_10']	「三方一圓」者，雖即四教俱名法用，正以偏法名為方便。	「三方一圓」者，雖即四教俱名法用，正以偏法名為方便。	03c	The three square and one round means that although the four teachings are all called methods, the biased Dharma is precisely called expedient.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c28_1']	次「若智」下釋用差會。	次「若智」下釋用差會。	03c	Next, below if wisdom, explaining the difference and unity of the function.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c28_15']	所以俱置法用言者，各契機耳。	所以俱置法用言者，各契機耳。	03c	The reason for both using the word method is that each accords with the capacity.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0209c29_8']	非俱會圓故並云「逗」。	非俱會圓故並云「逗」。	03c	Since they do not both accord with the perfect, they are both called responding.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a01_15']	又法用者，法名雖通，用既適時未為純一，為以何法逗何等機？	又法用者，法名雖通，用既適時未為純一，為以何法逗何等機？	03c	Moreover, although the name of the method is通通, the function that adapts to the times is not yet pure and one. What Dharma is used to respond to what capacities?
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a03_1']	故以四法赴機差會不等，權實相待是非俱非。	故以四法赴機差會不等，權實相待是非俱非。	03c	Therefore, the four methods respond to capacities with unequal differences, and the relative right and wrong are both not right.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a04_6']	如前釋法意既未融，逗物未暢規矩仍別，且云善用。	如前釋法意既未融，逗物未暢規矩仍別，且云善用。	03c	As previously explained, since the meaning of the Dharma has not yet been harmonized, and the guidance of beings has not yet been fully accomplished, the rules and regulations are still separate. It is said that skillful use is still needed.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a04_18']	「詣」謂所趣，正是用也。	「詣」謂所趣，正是用也。	03c	To go means the destination, which is precisely the use.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a05_6']	智詣不同，用法不等。	智詣不同，用法不等。	03c	The different levels of wisdom lead to the use of the Dharma not being the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a08_2']	次譬意者，正譬法用不同，有二重法譬，於中置却圓中方法之名，且借祕妙之號，故隔偏之圓亦有體內方便，故名祕妙。	次譬意者，正譬法用不同，有二重法譬，於中置却圓中方法之名，且借祕妙之號，故隔偏之圓亦有體內方便，故名祕妙。	03c	Next, the meaning of the analogy is to directly compare the different uses of the Dharma. There are two layers of Dharma and analogy. Within it, the name of the method in the perfect is set aside, and the title of secret and wonderful is borrowed. Therefore, the perfect that separates from the biased also has expedient means within the essence, and is called secret and wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a08_17']	祕妙之名似同第三，然其意則別。	祕妙之名似同第三，然其意則別。	03c	The name of secret and wonderful seems the same as the third, but its meaning is different.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a09_1']	何者？	何者？	03c	What is it?
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a13_5']	第三乃以開顯為妙，此中乃以獨圓為妙，故此文中四俱方法，前之三教唯名方法，非祕無妙，後之圓教是祕是妙，故後教中得祕妙名，非關開顯，故用偏法，如以一指偏目一方；	第三乃以開顯為妙，此中乃以獨圓為妙，故此文中四俱方法，前之三教唯名方法，非祕無妙，後之圓教是祕是妙，故後教中得祕妙名，非關開顯，故用偏法，如以一指偏目一方；	03c	The third takes revealing the true as wonderful, and here it takes the unique perfect as wonderful. Therefore, in this text, the four methods are used together. The first three teachings are only called methods, not secret or wonderful. The later perfect teaching is secret and wonderful. Therefore, the later teaching gets the name of secret and wonderful, not related to revealing the true. Therefore, using biased methods is like using one finger to point to one direction.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a14_1']	若用圓法，如以五指遍示諸方。	若用圓法，如以五指遍示諸方。	03c	If using perfect methods is like using five fingers to show all directions.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a15_3']	三明用權意者，爾前未合即以權法名為隨欲。	三明用權意者，爾前未合即以權法名為隨欲。	03c	Third, clarifying the meaning of using the provisional. Before this, it was not yet combined, so the provisional methods were called following desires.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a18_1']	四引證者，應以三權為引出之法，文寄小說故云「三界」，況所離不同三界無別，若於如來方便本一，此意未宣故屬昔教。	四引證者，應以三權為引出之法，文寄小說故云「三界」，況所離不同三界無別，若於如來方便本一，此意未宣故屬昔教。	03c	Fourth, for the evidence, the three provisional should be used as the method for drawing out. The text entrusts the small talk, therefore it says three realms. Moreover, the different things to be left behind are not separate from the three realms. If in the Tathagata's skillful means, it is originally one. This meaning has not yet been proclaimed, therefore it belongs to the teachings of the past.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a20_4']	雖是體外方便，於理無非體內，而眾生未知，準佛意說，故云「稱歎方便」，以未開故非今品意。	雖是體外方便，於理無非體內，而眾生未知，準佛意說，故云「稱歎方便」，以未開故非今品意。	03c	Although it is an expedient outside the essence, in principle it is not apart from the essence, but sentient beings do not yet know. According to the Buddha's intention, it is said to be praising the expedient, because it has not yet been revealed, it is not the meaning of this chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a23_6']	次第二約能詮者，若理教相望，四教各論無非能詮，今以三望一，三為一實作詮，故三名能詮，是則前之三教教行人理悉為能詮。	次第二約能詮者，若理教相望，四教各論無非能詮，今以三望一，三為一實作詮，故三名能詮，是則前之三教教行人理悉為能詮。	03c	Next, the second is about the expounder. If principle and teaching are compared, the four teachings each discuss what is not the expounder. Now, the three are compared to the one truth, and the three are the expounder of the one truth, therefore the three are called the expounder. This means that the teachings, practices, people, and principles of the previous three teachings are all the expounder.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a23_11']	於中為七：	於中為七：	03c	There are seven parts in this:
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a24_10']	初直立三教為門，此從義釋非關字訓。	初直立三教為門，此從義釋非關字訓。	03c	First, directly establishing the three teachings as the gate. This is from the meaning of the text, not related to the interpretation of the characters.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a25_17']	次「門名」下釋門義，如世之門本為能通，三皆入實故名為門。	次「門名」下釋門義，如世之門本為能通，三皆入實故名為門。	03c	Next, under the meaning of the gate, it explains the meaning of the gate. Like the gate in the world, it is originally able to pass through. The three all enter the truth, therefore it is called the gate.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a28_1']	三「方便」下明門意，眾生不了元是所通，依其所執得成弄引，但不善曲者以引為弄。	三「方便」下明門意，眾生不了元是所通，依其所執得成弄引，但不善曲者以引為弄。	03c	Third, under expedient means, it clarifies the meaning of the gate. Sentient beings do not understand that it is originally what is passed through. Based on their attachments, they become playful. Those who are not good at bending use bending as playfulness.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210a29_1']	四「真實」下明門用，雖非即所，得入由茲。	四「真實」下明門用，雖非即所，得入由茲。	03c	Fourth, true and below clarify the function of the gate. Although it is not the object of attainment, one enters by means of this.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b02_1']	五「從能」下明得名，權實尚隔由物機差，故前之二釋，於顯露邊及別地前，非今品意。	五「從能」下明得名，權實尚隔由物機差，故前之二釋，於顯露邊及別地前，非今品意。	03c	Fifth, from the ability and below clarify the naming. The provisional and real are still separated due to the differences in the capacities of beings. Therefore, the first two explanations, on the side of revelation and the stages before the Distinct, are not the meaning of this chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b04_1']	六引證意者，明彼昔門但云能通，於今須開，故云「開方便門」，非謂於彼已明開門。	六引證意者，明彼昔門但云能通，於今須開，故云「開方便門」，非謂於彼已明開門。	03c	Sixth, the meaning of the citation of evidence clarifies that the former gate only says it can lead to, and now it needs to be opened, therefore it says opening the gate of skillful means, it does not mean that the opening of the gate has already been clarified there.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b04_10']	七「此義」下結非。	七「此義」下結非。	03c	Seventh, this meaning and below conclude what is not.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b05_17']	第三釋者，即今品意，但前二釋於昔但得名偏名門，祕而不說；	第三釋者，即今品意，但前二釋於昔但得名偏名門，祕而不說；	03c	The third explanation is the meaning of this chapter. But the first two explanations were only named biased and named gates in the past, and were kept secret and not spoken of;
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b06_17']	今開其偏門，即圓所也，故云「祕妙」。	今開其偏門，即圓所也，故云「祕妙」。	03c	Now, opening the biased gate is the same as the perfect, therefore it is called secret and wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b07_7']	顯露彰灼故云「真祕」。	顯露彰灼故云「真祕」。	03c	Revealed and clearly manifested, therefore it is called true and secret.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b07_11']	又為六：	又為六：	03c	There are also six parts:
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b08_8']	初直立者，於昔成祕，彼祕被開於今成妙。	初直立者，於昔成祕，彼祕被開於今成妙。	03c	First, the direct establishment is that which was accomplished in the past, that secret was opened and now it becomes wonderful.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b10_6']	次「妙達」下釋功用者，達即是開用妙之便，以開祕方，妙外無法故云「即是」。	次「妙達」下釋功用者，達即是開用妙之便，以開祕方，妙外無法故云「即是」。	03c	Next, under wondrously penetrating, the function is explained. Penetrating is the skillful means of opening the wondrous, using the secret method to open up the wondrous, as there are no dharmas outside the wondrous, therefore it is said it is.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b12_17']	三「點內」下約人教以示相者，眾生身中有昔種緣，名為衣珠，自退已來於彼醉客，偏門尚無偏門之名，何況圓所？	三「點內」下約人教以示相者，眾生身中有昔種緣，名為衣珠，自退已來於彼醉客，偏門尚無偏門之名，何況圓所？	03c	Third, under pointing to the inner, using people and teachings to show the characteristics. The body of sentient beings has the causes and conditions of past seeds, which is called the jewel in the robe. Since one's own retrogression, in that drunken guest, the biased gate does not even have the name of the biased gate, let alone the perfect?
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b14_13']	若不開之，三權未顯如衣覆珠，今經開之，與果智一，作人亦爾思之可知。	若不開之，三權未顯如衣覆珠，今經開之，與果智一，作人亦爾思之可知。	03c	If it is not opened, the three provisional [teachings] are not yet revealed, like the robe covering the jewel. Now, this sutra opens it up, and it is the same as the wisdom of the fruit. The person who is made [to understand] is also like this. One can know by thinking about it.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b15_18']	四「如斯」下結名，方法及門即是祕妙，故云「如斯」。	四「如斯」下結名，方法及門即是祕妙，故云「如斯」。	03c	Fourth, under like this, the name is concluded. The method and the gate are precisely the secret and wondrous, therefore it is said like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b16_5']	五「如經」下引證。	五「如經」下引證。	03c	Fifth, under as the sutra says, the evidence is cited.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b16_16']	六「故以」下結名顯是。	六「故以」下結名顯是。	03c	Sixth, under therefore, the name is concluded and shown to be correct.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b17_1']	次料簡中三：	次料簡中三：	03c	Next, in the analysis, there are three:
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b18_7']	初約自他三語，寄前初釋以簡於三，故初被開即第三也。	初約自他三語，寄前初釋以簡於三，故初被開即第三也。	03c	First, using the three statements of self and other, borrowing the first explanation to distinguish the three. Therefore, the first to be opened is the third.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b19_13']	次約能所寄第二釋，以簡三文，故第二被開亦即第三。	次約能所寄第二釋，以簡三文，故第二被開亦即第三。	03c	Next, using the able and the so, borrowing the second explanation to distinguish the three texts. Therefore, the second to be opened is also the third.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b20_4']	三約四句共簡三釋。	三約四句共簡三釋。	03c	Third, using the four statements to jointly distinguish the three explanations.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0210b21_12']	初釋者，自有三文，簡初文者，三教一向名他名權，權隔實故。	初釋者，自有三文，簡初文者，三教一向名他名權，權隔實故。	03c	The first explanation has three texts. To distinguish the first text, the three teachings are all called other and provisional, because the provisional is separated from the real.

It is also not the Vimalakīrti Sūtra's entry into the gate of the non-dual. Since it is not non-dual, it is not the perfect teaching's mutual inclusion of the two truths.

First, it determines the first level as one real and one provisional, simply called the two truths. This is because these two truths are the basis for faith, which is to transform from an ordinary person to a lesser sage.

This truth is merely the detachment from attachment.

The ability and object of the transformative intent are not apart from these three. First, it causes ordinary beings to abandon existence and enter emptiness, which is the initial establishment of the Lesser Vehicle.

The ancient explanations of bodhisattvas only divide the Lesser and Great based on the subsequent stages, not discussing whether they know the Middle Way or not.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0212c01_5']	次「或者」下，中邊並亡即大菩薩，或指八地初地十地等覺。	次「或者」下，中邊並亡即大菩薩，或指八地初地十地等覺。	03c	Next, from Or below, the Middle and Extremes are both gone, which is for the great bodhisattvas, or referring to the eighth ground, first ground, tenth ground, and equivalent enlightenment.

In the three layers, he first uses ordinary beings as humans and gods, and the humans and gods give rise to faith, destroying existence and entering emptiness as the Two Vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0212c06_1']	次「又為」下約三假判，此似次第修中之人先破三假，此中一番但加三假，餘無異也。	次「又為」下約三假判，此似次第修中之人先破三假，此中一番但加三假，餘無異也。	03c	Next, below Also, in terms of the three provisional posits, it is divided. This is similar to the person of medium capacity in the gradual cultivation who first refutes the three provisional posits.

The first to refute existence must have the three provisional posits, so the first uses the three provisional posits as conventional. All the meanings are the same.

Therefore, refuting the provisional and cultivating the middle way are mostly the intention of the masters of the Middle Treatise.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0212c12_15']	第三重應云非三假，空有為二、非空非有為不二，二不二為俗，非二非不二為真，準前可知，故不重說。	第三重應云非三假，空有為二、非空非有為不二，二不二為俗，非二非不二為真，準前可知，故不重說。	03c	The third level should say not the three provisional posits. Emptiness and existence are two, and neither emptiness nor existence is non-dual. Dual and non-dual are conventional, and neither dual nor non-dual is true. It can be understood according to the previous, so it is not repeated.

Skillful use is not established, but only becomes gradual, therefore it is said to be not so.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0212c20_8']	後約三轉又除果地，意欲擬為智諦離著，以因顯果，不意亦成漸次之非。	後約三轉又除果地，意欲擬為智諦離著，以因顯果，不意亦成漸次之非。	03c	Later, regarding the three turnings, also excluding the fruition ground, the intention is to intend to be the wisdom truth, detaching from attachment, manifesting the fruition with the cause, not intending to also become the non-gradual.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0212c24_6']	次引文正示者，今用五時八教相入方成一實，一一時中橫竪間雜，唯至法華諦智純一，仍辨使成方便之相，故方便初即歎五佛智諦方便，是故品題須依圓頓。	次引文正示者，今用五時八教相入方成一實，一一時中橫竪間雜，唯至法華諦智純一，仍辨使成方便之相，故方便初即歎五佛智諦方便，是故品題須依圓頓。	03c	Next, the text is quoted to show the correct meaning. Now, using the five periods and eight teachings to enter and form the one true Dharma, each period is horizontally and vertically mixed, only reaching the Lotus Sutra where the truth and wisdom are pure and one, and still distinguishing the aspects of skillful means. Therefore, the praise of the wisdom and truth of the five Buddhas in the beginning of the skillful means chapter is why the chapter title must be based on the perfect and sudden.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0212c24_11']	《經》云：	《經》云：	03c	The sutra says:

As for the four propositions of the vehicle, one is expedient and one is true, causing one to abandon the three and take the one. Although the disciples of the teaching abandon the three, they still cling to the one truth. Although gross delusions are removed, subtle delusions arise again.

Both the dual and the non-dual are expedient means, and neither the dual nor the non-dual is taken as the truth. The refutation is based on the previous investigation of the person and the place.

The quiescent and extinct truth cannot be spoken of, which is the true reality.

Since the expedient and true have been revealed, who would still cling to words?

It should use skillful means to explain the present chapter, yet it gives a literal explanation that greatly contradicts the chapter title. Therefore, it is known that Jiasang's body was imbued with the wonderful teachings and his spirit was already bathed in their meaning. The old texts were practiced first, so they must be thoroughly refuted. Understanding this great purport, master and disciple can be accomplished.

The branches and roots are not established, and the subsumption is also not appropriate. Moreover, if the fundamental is divided into two, and it is subsumed under one, one becomes the fundamental, and two are called branches. This means that the fundamental is originally a branch, and it should be necessary to harmonize with the beginning and follow the later. Therefore, the branches of the Huayan are opened, and it enters the fundamental perfection of the Lotus Sūtra. Moreover, both the distinct and perfect teachings of the Huayan are established as recent traces, and the meaning of the fundamental is further destroyed, and the fundamental of the Lotus Sūtra is established.

The capacities are all-pervasive, the Dharma is all-pervasive, the principle is all-pervasive, and the events are all-pervasive. All say all for the sake of being understandable. Because of the one emptiness, all are empty, therefore all are real. Because of the one provisional, all are provisional, therefore all are expedient. The third and fourth two phrases are simply the middle wisdom, which simultaneously illuminates and simultaneously transcends. Internally, due to the perfection of the three virtues and three bodies, externally the horizontal and vertical explicit and implicit uses are made.

This provisional has the real. This provisional is then referred to as the Chapter on Skillful Means. If both the provisional and the real are mentioned, then each has its own destination.

If one sees this meaning, one is always silent and always speaking, with no contradiction between words and actions, using this very principle as the object of contemplation, causing that contemplated object to be clearly visible, the other explanations do not have this.

Even if many dharma characteristics are listed, the great and small are difficult to distinguish. Although the teaching is judged at that time, the Lotus Sūtra is not yet revealed. If the Lotus Sūtra is considered to have the same flavor as the others, where is the statement that it is not mentioned in the three recitations?

Although the origin has not yet reached the universal principle of expedient and real, the text below says, This is my expedient, and the buddhas are also like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214b29_7']	故方便之名通於本迹，此既玄釋不同消文，是故不同光宅判句。	故方便之名通於本迹，此既玄釋不同消文，是故不同光宅判句。	03c	Therefore, the name expedient extends to both the origin and the traces. Since this is a profound interpretation different from the text, it is not the same as Guangzhai's division of the sentences.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c04_17']	又此八門次第意者，若不列名無以解釋，若不生起迷於詮次，解釋正示十文相狀，引證為防不信者故，結歸為明品元意故，分別為令釋品有歸，判釋令知麁妙有在，如是方顯品之深旨。	又此八門次第意者，若不列名無以解釋，若不生起迷於詮次，解釋正示十文相狀，引證為防不信者故，結歸為明品元意故，分別為令釋品有歸，判釋令知麁妙有在，如是方顯品之深旨。	03c	Moreover, as for the meaning of the sequence of these eight gates, if the names are not listed, there is no way to explain them. If the sequence of the expounded is not brought up, one will be confused. The explanation correctly shows the appearance of the ten texts. The citation of evidence is to prevent disbelief. The conclusion is to clarify the original meaning of the chapter. The discrimination is to make the explanation of the chapter have a destination. The division and explanation are to make one know the existence of the coarse and wonderful. In this way, one can only reveal the profound meaning of the chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c06_5']	又預辯本迹令識本地權實自他，方顯大途久近之化。	又預辯本迹令識本地權實自他，方顯大途久近之化。	03c	Moreover, the preliminary discussion of the origin and traces makes one recognize the expedient and real of the original ground, oneself and others, and only then can one reveal the long-term and short-term transformation.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c09_10']	於列名中，一一須安權實之稱，如云事理權實乃至悉檀權實，即是事權理實，乃至悉檀三權一實，復以三種釋品分之，乃成今經之方便也。	於列名中，一一須安權實之稱，如云事理權實乃至悉檀權實，即是事權理實，乃至悉檀三權一實，復以三種釋品分之，乃成今經之方便也。	03c	In the enumeration, each one must be given the names of provisional and real, such as provisional and real of phenomena and principles, up to provisional and real of the four siddhāntas. This is precisely the provisional of phenomena and the real of principles, up to the three provisional and one real of the four siddhāntas. Furthermore, using the three kinds to divide the chapter, it becomes the skillful means of this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c09_16']	故《論》云：	故《論》云：	03c	Therefore the treatise says:
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c10_9']	「自此已下示現此經因果相故」。	「自此已下示現此經因果相故」。	03c	From here on, it shows the cause and effect of this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c13_10']	故十雙中初五從因至果，後五果家勝用，況一部文亦可本迹而分因果，故知因中若無前四，則因義淺狹，若無後五，則果用麁近。	故十雙中初五從因至果，後五果家勝用，況一部文亦可本迹而分因果，故知因中若無前四，則因義淺狹，若無後五，則果用麁近。	03c	Therefore, among the ten pairs, the first five go from cause to effect, and the latter five are the superior functions of the effect. Moreover, the text of the entire sutra can be divided into cause and effect based on the original and the trace. Therefore, we know that if there were no first four in the cause, then the meaning of the cause would be shallow and narrow. If there were no latter five, then the function of the effect would be coarse and near.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c15_10']	於中教是聖化，且以受者得名，不同世人以教為因、佛智為果，亦不同他三四等也。	於中教是聖化，且以受者得名，不同世人以教為因、佛智為果，亦不同他三四等也。	03c	Among them, the teaching is the holy transformation, and for now it is named after the receiver. It is different from worldly people who take the teaching as the cause and the Buddha's wisdom as the effect, and also different from others' three, four, etc.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c16_1']	餘如下結權實中。	餘如下結權實中。	03c	The rest are as below, in the conclusion of the provisional and real.

['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c19_1']	又復文標能化義須對所，故後五雙唯體用中一隻對所，餘四並從能對得名。	又復文標能化義須對所，故後五雙唯體用中一隻對所，餘四並從能對得名。	03c	Moreover, the text indicates the ability to transform, and the meaning requires corresponding to what is transformed. Therefore, the latter five pairs are only one branch of essence and function corresponding to what is transformed, and the other four are named according to what is able to correspond.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c20_5']	又此亦與十妙義同，若不爾者，誰知方便須具十法？	又此亦與十妙義同，若不爾者，誰知方便須具十法？	03c	Moreover, this is also the same as the meaning of the ten marvels. If it were not so, who would know that skillful means must be endowed with ten dharmas?
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c20_14']	誰知十法義遍一經？	誰知十法義遍一經？	03c	Who would know that the meaning of the ten dharmas pervades the entire sūtra?
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c22_14']	若無十法乃成經文不詮因果及以能所，是故十雙皆窮至要，方是今經之十雙也。	若無十法乃成經文不詮因果及以能所，是故十雙皆窮至要，方是今經之十雙也。	03c	If there were no ten dharmas, it would result in the sūtra text not explaining causes and effects, as well as what is able and what is transformed. Therefore, the ten pairs all reach the utmost essentials, and are the ten pairs of this sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_03c:0214c27_10']	若爾，一經始終皆名方便，並指前教以為所開，方乃可云此經方便，故知序中證信發起方便，譬喻秖是比況方便，因緣秖是往昔方便，本門秖是久遠方便，流通秖是諸佛菩薩通法方便，由是方便故名真實。	若爾，一經始終皆名方便，並指前教以為所開，方乃可云此經方便，故知序中證信發起方便，譬喻秖是比況方便，因緣秖是往昔方便，本門秖是久遠方便，流通秖是諸佛菩薩通法方便，由是方便故名真實。	03c	If so, the entire sūtra is called skillful means, and all previous teachings are considered what is to be revealed. Only then can it be said that this sūtra is skillful means. Therefore, we know that the preface, the establishment of faith and the arousal of the teaching, are skillful means. The parables are only skillful means of comparison. The causes and conditions are only skillful means of the past. The chapter on the origin is only skillful means of the distant past. The chapter on propagation is only skillful means of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transmitting the Dharma. Because of these skillful means, it is called true reality.

The entire Lotus Sūtra can be known in a moment, and the teachings of the entire lifetime [of the Buddha] can be recognized in an instant. Cause and effect, self and other, all form a single Dharma. The ten directions and three times have no different aspirations.

The unsurpassed Buddha fruit is attainable on the path of cultivation. Those with eyes, please observe it.
