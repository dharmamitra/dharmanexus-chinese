['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c23_10']	2破時品第三之餘復次有諸異部，於無常法說有剎那暫時住體，即依住體立有實時。	2破時品第三之餘復次有諸異部，於無常法說有剎那暫時住體，即依住體立有實時。	Regarding impermanent phenomena, it is said that there is a momentary temporary abiding essence. Abiding in that essence, real time is established.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c24_1', 'ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c25_6']	為破彼言，故說頌曰：🔽「無常何有住？	為破彼言，故說頌曰： 「無常何有住？	In order to refute that statement, a verse is spoken:🔽How can there be abiding in the impermanent?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c25_14']	　　住無有何體？	　　住無有何體？	How can there be an essence in non-abiding?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c26_2']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c26_11']	自相經停故名為住。	自相經停故名為住。	Because of abiding in its own characteristics, it is called abiding.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c27_11']	有為諸法無常所遷不能暫停，如何有住？	有為諸法無常所遷不能暫停，如何有住？	Since conditioned phenomena are moved by impermanence and cannot remain for a moment, how can there be abiding?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c28_1']	既無住體，依何立時？	既無住體，依何立時？	Since there is no essence of abiding, what is time established based on?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c28_6']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c29_1']	言無常者，或即法滅、或法滅因。	言無常者，或即法滅、或法滅因。	What is called impermanence is either the cessation of phenomena or the cause of the cessation of phenomena.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0209c29_20']	一切有為無常所逼，暫生即滅，何容有住？	一切有為無常所逼，暫生即滅，何容有住？	All conditioned phenomena are oppressed by impermanence, and upon being born they immediately cease. How can there be abiding?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a01_17']	住位住依無常隨逼，應如後位不得少留。	住位住依無常隨逼，應如後位不得少留。	In the state of abiding, the basis of abiding is oppressed by impermanence, and it should be like the subsequent state, not remaining for a moment.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a03_6']	若謂無常雖居住位，爾時住力能制無常，扶己所依令其暫住。	若謂無常雖居住位，爾時住力能制無常，扶己所依令其暫住。	If you say that although impermanence exists in the state of abiding, at that time the power of abiding can restrain impermanence, supporting its basis and causing it to abide temporarily,
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a03_16']	此亦非理，故次頌曰：	此亦非理，故次頌曰：	this is also unreasonable. Therefore the next verse says:
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a04_14']	「初若有住者，　　後應無變衰。	「初若有住者，　　後應無變衰。	If there is abiding at the beginning, later there should be no change and decay.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a05_2']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a06_1']	生滅相續，不捨自類後異相起，名曰變衰。	生滅相續，不捨自類後異相起，名曰變衰。	The continuity of arising and ceasing, not abandoning its own kind, with the arising of a later different characteristic, is called change and decay.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a06_19']	後位住相與前住體既無差別，何有變衰？	後位住相與前住體既無差別，何有變衰？	The characteristic of abiding in the later stage and the essence of abiding in the previous stage are already without distinction. How can there be change and decay?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a08_7']	亦不應言由後法起，令前住相而有變衰，住體如前相無變故。	亦不應言由後法起，令前住相而有變衰，住體如前相無變故。	It is also not appropriate to say that due to the arising of a later dharma, the characteristic of abiding in the previous stage becomes subject to change and decay, because the essence of abiding is as before, without the characteristic of change.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a08_16']	豈非後起前住變耶？	豈非後起前住變耶？	Isn't it that due to the arising of the later [stage], the abiding of the previous [stage] changes?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a09_6']	云何餘生餘法名變？	云何餘生餘法名變？	How can the arising of another [stage] and another [dharma] be called change?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a10_14']	現見餘生餘亦名變，如酪既生說乳為變，麁雖似變細則不然。	現見餘生餘亦名變，如酪既生說乳為變，麁雖似變細則不然。	We see that the arising of another [stage] and another [dharma] is also called change. For example, when curd has already arisen, milk is said to have changed. Although the coarse [change] is similar to change, the subtle [change] is not so.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a10_19']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a12_12']	世間乳酪同類相續別相難知，不悟其中有細生滅，謂前乳變由後酪生。	世間乳酪同類相續別相難知，不悟其中有細生滅，謂前乳變由後酪生。	In the world, milk and curd are of the same kind, and their continuity is difficult to discern. One does not realize that there is subtle arising and ceasing within them, thinking that the transformation of previous milk is due to the arising of subsequent curd.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a13_11']	微細理中即前住體變由後起，其義難知。	微細理中即前住體變由後起，其義難知。	In the subtle principle, the transformation of the essence of abiding from before is due to the arising from after. Its meaning is difficult to know.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a15_1']	復次要自審察知有住體，方可為他說有住相。	復次要自審察知有住體，方可為他說有住相。	Moreover, one must personally examine and know that there is an essence of abiding in order to be able to explain to others that there is a characteristic of abiding.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a15_19']	然無方便可審住體，知其定有能住於法。	然無方便可審住體，知其定有能住於法。	However, there is no skillful means to examine the essence of abiding, to know that it definitely exists and is able to abide in dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a16_4']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this so?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a16_9']	故次頌曰：	故次頌曰：	Therefore, the next verse says:
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a17_14']	「譬如無一識，　　能了於二義；	「譬如無一識，　　能了於二義；	Just as there is no single consciousness that can cognize two meanings,
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a18_13']	如是無一義，　　二識所能知。	如是無一義，　　二識所能知。	In the same way, there is no single meaning that can be cognized by two consciousnesses.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a19_2']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a21_17']	所識諸境要由能識前觀後察方知是有，若有一身同類二識於一現境前觀後察，審知境相不異於前，爾乃可言現法有住。	所識諸境要由能識前觀後察方知是有，若有一身同類二識於一現境前觀後察，審知境相不異於前，爾乃可言現法有住。	The cognized objects must be cognized by the previous cognition and subsequently examined in order to know that they exist. If there is a single body of the same kind with two consciousnesses cognizing a single present object, examining it before and after, carefully knowing that the characteristics of the object are no different from before, then one can say that the present dharma has abiding.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a23_14']	即無一身同類二識，於一現境前觀後察，汝等云何能知現法剎那有住，依此立時？	即無一身同類二識，於一現境前觀後察，汝等云何能知現法剎那有住，依此立時？	Then there is no single body of the same kind with two consciousnesses, one observing the present object and the other examining it. How can you know that the present dharma has duration and establish time based on this?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a25_12']	汝不可言，前念意識觀未來法，後念意識察現在法，知有住體，以未來世法未有故。	汝不可言，前念意識觀未來法，後念意識察現在法，知有住體，以未來世法未有故。	You cannot say that the previous moment of mental consciousness observes future dharmas and the subsequent moment of mental consciousness examines present dharmas, knowing there is an enduring substance, because dharmas in the future world do not yet exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a27_10']	亦不可言，前念意識觀現在法，後念意識察過去法，知有住體，以過去世法已滅故。	亦不可言，前念意識觀現在法，後念意識察過去法，知有住體，以過去世法已滅故。	Nor can you say that the previous moment of mental consciousness observes present dharmas and the subsequent moment of mental consciousness examines past dharmas, knowing there is an enduring substance, because dharmas in the past world have already ceased.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210a28_8']	縱許去來法是有者，時移世易不可名住。	縱許去來法是有者，時移世易不可名住。	Even if you allow that past and future dharmas exist, as time changes and worlds evolve, they cannot be called enduring.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b01_15']	又不可言，色等諸法於現在世住經多時，心等諸法無常迅速，故二念心同緣現在，前觀後察知其有住。	又不可言，色等諸法於現在世住經多時，心等諸法無常迅速，故二念心同緣現在，前觀後察知其有住。	You cannot say that form and other dharmas endure for a long time in the present world, while mind and other dharmas are impermanent and fleeting. Therefore, two moments of mind observing the present together, the previous observation and the subsequent examination, know there is duration.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b02_14']	既同有為，如何不等色等諸法非久時住？	既同有為，如何不等色等諸法非久時住？	Since they are both conditioned, why are form and other dharmas not equally not enduring for a long time?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b03_4']	是有為故，猶如心等。	是有為故，猶如心等。	Because they are conditioned, like mind and so on.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b04_3']	有餘執色有住非心，此亦應以心為喻破。	有餘執色有住非心，此亦應以心為喻破。	Others maintain that form endures but mind does not. This view must be refuted by using mind as a simile.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b06_1']	一有情身同類二識，定不共緣現在一法，一身同類前後識故，如緣前後青黃二心。	一有情身同類二識，定不共緣現在一法，一身同類前後識故，如緣前後青黃二心。	Two consciousnesses of the same species in the body of one sentient being definitely do not have the same present dharma as an object, because consciousnesses of the same species in one body are sequential, like the mind that has blue as its object and the mind that has yellow as its object.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b07_17']	亦不可說，五識所觀意識能審知其有住，汝等不許二識俱生，意識生時境已滅故。	亦不可說，五識所觀意識能審知其有住，汝等不許二識俱生，意識生時境已滅故。	You cannot claim that the manas consciousness can carefully know that form endures, because you do not admit that the two consciousnesses, visual and manas, are born together, because the object has already perished when manas consciousness is born.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b08_16']	設許一身多識並起各緣別境，非能審知。	設許一身多識並起各緣別境，非能審知。	Even if you admit that many consciousnesses are born together in one body and have different objects, they still cannot carefully know that form endures.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b10_5']	雖許意識知五識境，然各自變同現量攝，俱受新境非重審知。	雖許意識知五識境，然各自變同現量攝，俱受新境非重審知。	Even if you admit that manas consciousness knows the objects of the five consciousnesses, still each transforms itself into the object and is categorized as direct perception, and all are receiving new objects and are not a careful review of something already known.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b10_19']	由是故說，無有一義二識能知。	由是故說，無有一義二識能知。	Consequently, it is said that there is no case of two consciousnesses knowing one object.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b11_15']	復次亦無一識審知二義，皆實有體。	復次亦無一識審知二義，皆實有體。	Also, there is no case of one consciousness carefully knowing two real objects.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b12_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b12_15']	若欲作意審知前有，後境未生；	若欲作意審知前有，後境未生；	If you want to make a judgment, you should carefully know that the previous object has already existed, and the subsequent object has not yet arisen.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b13_4']	審知後有，前境已滅。	審知後有，前境已滅。	You should carefully know that the subsequent object has already existed, and the previous object has already ceased.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b14_3']	尚無有能審一實有，況能知二現在二境？	尚無有能審一實有，況能知二現在二境？	There is still no ability to carefully know one real existent, let alone be able to know two present objects.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b14_18']	雖俱可了，皆新受故，非重審知。	雖俱可了，皆新受故，非重審知。	Although both can be understood, they are all newly experienced, so they are not carefully known again.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b16_5']	緣餘境識不能審知餘境實有，帶餘相故，猶如各別緣二境心。	緣餘境識不能審知餘境實有，帶餘相故，猶如各別緣二境心。	Consciousness that takes other objects cannot carefully know the real existence of other objects, because it takes other characteristics, just like the mind that takes two objects separately.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b17_13']	又審察心不能審察外境實有，帶餘相故，如新了受現在境心。	又審察心不能審察外境實有，帶餘相故，如新了受現在境心。	Moreover, the mind of careful examination cannot carefully examine the real existence of external objects, because it takes other characteristics, like the mind that newly understands the present object.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b18_3']	又數論者作如是說：	又數論者作如是說：	Moreover, the Sāṃkhyas say:
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b19_16']	若立慧體念念各異知諸法者，是則不應先求後證、先受後憶、先疑後決。	若立慧體念念各異知諸法者，是則不應先求後證、先受後憶、先疑後決。	If you establish that the substance of wisdom is different in each moment and knows all dharmas, then you should not first seek and later realize, first experience and later remember, first doubt and later decide.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b20_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b20_19']	不見天授先求受疑，後時祠授能證憶決。	不見天授先求受疑，後時祠授能證憶決。	We do not see Devadatta first seeking to experience and doubt, and later Yajñadatta being able to realize, remember, and decide.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b21_17']	由是當知，唯有一慧常能照了一切境界。	由是當知，唯有一慧常能照了一切境界。	Therefore, you should know that there is only one wisdom that is always able to illuminate all objects.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b23_7']	故立量言，知青等慧決定不離，知黃等慧是慧體故，如黃等慧。	故立量言，知青等慧決定不離，知黃等慧是慧體故，如黃等慧。	Therefore, we establish an inference: the cognition of blue, etc. is definitely not separate from the cognition of yellow, etc., because it is the substance of wisdom, just like the cognition of yellow, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b24_15']	是故一慧知一切義，此亦不然，常法轉變皆先已破，不應重執。	是故一慧知一切義，此亦不然，常法轉變皆先已破，不應重執。	Therefore, it is also unreasonable that one wisdom knows all objects. The transformation of permanent dharmas has all been refuted previously, and you should not insist on it again.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b25_12']	又汝云何知此一慧其體是常知一切義？	又汝云何知此一慧其體是常知一切義？	Moreover, how do you know that this one wisdom is permanent in substance and knows all objects?
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b27_11']	非不審察所知慧相可言此慧知一切境，非即此慧能自審知，色等法中曾不見故。	非不審察所知慧相可言此慧知一切境，非即此慧能自審知，色等法中曾不見故。	It cannot be said that the characteristics of the cognizing wisdom are not carefully examined and that this wisdom knows all objects, because this wisdom itself cannot know itself, because it has never been seen among form and other dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b28_11']	此慧必有別慧能知，是所知故，猶如色等。	此慧必有別慧能知，是所知故，猶如色等。	This wisdom must have another wisdom that can know it, because it is what is known, just like form and other dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210b29_9']	又青等慧其性各別，所知異故，如自他慧。	又青等慧其性各別，所知異故，如自他慧。	Moreover, the natures of the wisdoms of blue, etc. are each different, because the objects known are different, just like the wisdoms of oneself and others.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c02_6']	此中意明，無有一慧能重審知二境實有，不言一慧不知多法，勿一念心不了多境。	此中意明，無有一慧能重審知二境實有，不言一慧不知多法，勿一念心不了多境。	The meaning here is to clarify that there is no single wisdom that can repeatedly examine and know the true existence of two objects. It does not say that a single wisdom does not know many dharmas. Do not say that a single moment of mind does not understand many objects.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c04_5']	又明慧體不能自審，不言慧體不能自照，勿心心法不能自證，若爾不應後時自憶。	又明慧體不能自審，不言慧體不能自照，勿心心法不能自證，若爾不應後時自憶。	Moreover, it clarifies that the essence of wisdom cannot examine itself. It does not say that the essence of wisdom cannot illuminate itself. Do not say that mind and mental factors cannot be self-cognizant, otherwise one should not be able to remember oneself later.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c06_6']	若言照境是用非體，體非照故不隨境別，照用隨緣乃有無量，有多用故，無如上失。	若言照境是用非體，體非照故不隨境別，照用隨緣乃有無量，有多用故，無如上失。	If it is said that illuminating objects is a function, not the essence, and the essence is not illuminating, therefore it does not distinguish according to objects. The illuminating function follows conditions and thus has innumerable distinctions. Because there are many functions, there is no error as above.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c07_6']	此亦不然，體若非照，應如色等不名為慧。	此亦不然，體若非照，應如色等不名為慧。	This is also not so. If the essence is not illuminating, it should be like form, etc., and not be called wisdom.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c09_9']	若言照用不離體故無斯過者，此亦不然，用不離體，照應成一，不離體故，猶如慧體。	若言照用不離體故無斯過者，此亦不然，用不離體，照應成一，不離體故，猶如慧體。	If it is said that the illuminating function is not separate from the essence, therefore there is no error, this is also not so. Because the function is not separate from the essence, illumination should be one, because it is not separate from the essence, just like the essence of wisdom.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c10_4']	體不離用，慧應成多，不離用故。	體不離用，慧應成多，不離用故。	Because the essence is not separate from the function, wisdom should be many, because it is not separate from the function.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c10_19']	猶如照用，用隨體一，違前比量。	猶如照用，用隨體一，違前比量。	It is like illumination and function, where the function is one with the substance. This contradicts your previous inference.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c11_9']	體隨用多，違自所立。	體隨用多，違自所立。	If the substance follows the many functions, it contradicts what you yourself have established.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c13_7']	若用隨體無差別者，總緣別緣希求證得領受憶念猶豫決定，如是等用差別應無。	若用隨體無差別者，總緣別緣希求證得領受憶念猶豫決定，如是等用差別應無。	If the function is without distinction following the substance, then the distinctions in function such as the general cognition, the specific cognition, the desire to seek and attain, the experience, the recollection, the doubt, and the determination would not exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c15_15']	若體隨用有差別者，汝所立慧應念念別，亦應無有先求後證、先受後憶、先疑後決，是則汝言翻成自害。	若體隨用有差別者，汝所立慧應念念別，亦應無有先求後證、先受後憶、先疑後決，是則汝言翻成自害。	If the substance has distinctions following the function, then the wisdom you have established would be different in each moment, and there would be no first seeking and then attaining, first experiencing and then recollecting, first doubting and then determining. This would then be a self-refutation of your statement.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c18_2']	又汝若言慧體雖一，然用隨緣變成多種故無失者，此亦不然，慧用隨緣變成多故，應如樂等其性非一。	又汝若言慧體雖一，然用隨緣變成多種故無失者，此亦不然，慧用隨緣變成多故，應如樂等其性非一。	Moreover, if you say that although the substance of wisdom is one, the function becomes many following conditions, so there is no error, this is also not so. Because the function of wisdom becomes many following conditions, it should be like pleasure, etc., and its nature is not one.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c19_19']	世間不見有色等物體常是一、用變成多，世俗事中假立體用，容可施設體一用多。	世間不見有色等物體常是一、用變成多，世俗事中假立體用，容可施設體一用多。	In the world, one does not see that the substance of form, etc. is always one while the function becomes many. In worldly matters, the substance and function are provisionally established, and it is possible to establish that the substance is one while the function is many.
['ZH_T30_1571_005:0210c20_17']	勝義理中無如是義，如何一物實有一多？	勝義理中無如是義，如何一物實有一多？	In the principle of ultimate truth, there is no such meaning. How can one real thing have many?
