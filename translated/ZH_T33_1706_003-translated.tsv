This is the same in the sūtras and śāstras. The first point cannot be changed. Only the Sūtra on the Twelve Feasts has the explanation of attaining enlightenment at thirty-five, which is due to different perceptions of the audience.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c08_13']	二以小始十二年說四阿含教，二不可易也。	二以小始十二年說四阿含教，二不可易也。	Second, the teaching of the four Āgamas was preached for twelve years from the beginning of the small [vehicle]. The second point cannot be changed.

['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c11_21']	今謂初年月八日者，當是說諸部《般若》之後，接次《仁王》乃其時也。	今謂初年月八日者，當是說諸部《般若》之後，接次《仁王》乃其時也。	Now, the eighth day of the first month refers to the time after the various versions of the Prajnaparamita were taught, and the Sutra of the Benevolent King was taught next.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c12_16']	而言月八日者，猶正月初八，文之略耳。	而言月八日者，猶正月初八，文之略耳。	As for the eighth day of the month, it is still the eighth day of the first month, just a brief mention in the text.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c13_7']	方坐，猶始坐，亦正也。	方坐，猶始坐，亦正也。	Sitting in the proper manner means starting to sit, also meaning correct.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c14_1']	若佛本住及自證法，其住久矣。	若佛本住及自證法，其住久矣。	If the Buddha originally abides and realizes the Dharma by himself, he has been abiding for a long time.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c14_14']	而曰方坐者，以修顯性云爾。	而曰方坐者，以修顯性云爾。	Yet it says sitting in the proper manner because the practice manifests the nature.

The commentary quotes the Samadhiraja Sutra and so on, which are the grounds where the Buddha abides. It is also like the non-sequential ten of the Lankavatara Sutra, not the sequential ten grounds.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c18_3']	而疏以別接通等為釋，雖不無是理，終非通方之論，姑置之云云。	而疏以別接通等為釋，雖不無是理，終非通方之論，姑置之云云。	Yet the commentary explains it as connecting the distinct with the inclusive and so on. Although this is not without reason, it is not a comprehensive discussion after all. Let us leave it at that.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c19_3']	又曰入大寂室三昧者，前所住地豈乖寂理？	又曰入大寂室三昧者，前所住地豈乖寂理？	It also says entering the samadhi of the great silent room. How could the previously abided ground be contrary to the principle of silence?
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c20_2']	一往以論，前所住者智也，今所入者定也。	一往以論，前所住者智也，今所入者定也。	Generally speaking, what was previously abided in is wisdom, and what is entered now is concentration.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c21_16']	抑凡說法必有由緒，入定而後觀機，觀機而後起說，此其序也，故今入是定。	抑凡說法必有由緒，入定而後觀機，觀機而後起說，此其序也，故今入是定。	Moreover, expounding the Dharma must have a reason. One enters concentration and then observes the capacity of the audience. After observing the capacity, one then arises to speak. This is the sequence. Therefore, one enters this concentration now.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c22_3']	凡為四意申之：	凡為四意申之：	There are four general meanings to explain it:
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c23_11']	一者觀機授藥、二者因定發慧、三者說法軌儀、四者以聖況凡。	一者觀機授藥、二者因定發慧、三者說法軌儀、四者以聖況凡。	First, observing the capacity and bestowing the medicine; second, developing wisdom through concentration; third, the rules for expounding the Dharma; fourth, using the sage to illustrate the ordinary.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c24_1']	得是四意，其旨明矣。	得是四意，其旨明矣。	If one obtains these four meanings, the purport is clear.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c24_15']	亦可對四悉，即因緣義也云云。	亦可對四悉，即因緣義也云云。	It can also correspond to the four aspects of understanding, which is the meaning of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c25_2']	「又大寂」下，為二：	「又大寂」下，為二：	Moreover, the great tranquility and below, there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c25_7']	初約理釋。	初約理釋。	First, explaining from the perspective of principle.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c28_17']	夫理至寂滅為義，涅槃亦寂滅之名，故以三德大涅槃而配釋之，謂大即法身、寂即般若、滅即解脫，具是三者始曰深禪，依之而住莫尚乎此，故以室表之。	夫理至寂滅為義，涅槃亦寂滅之名，故以三德大涅槃而配釋之，謂大即法身、寂即般若、滅即解脫，具是三者始曰深禪，依之而住莫尚乎此，故以室表之。	The ultimate principle is quiescent extinction, which is the meaning. Nirvana is also the name of quiescent extinction, so it is matched and explained with the three virtues of great nirvana, namely, the great is the Dharma body, quiescent is prajna, and extinction is liberation. One who possesses these three is called profound meditation. Relying on it to abide, nothing surpasses this, so the room is used to illustrate it.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0296c29_11']	窟亦室也，兼引大通入室為證。	窟亦室也，兼引大通入室為證。	The cave is also a room, and it also cites the proof of the great enlightenment entering the room.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a01_6']	又〈法師品〉慈悲為室，亦其理也。	又〈法師品〉慈悲為室，亦其理也。	Also, the Chapter on Dharma Teachers takes compassion as the room, which is also its principle.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a01_16']	而大寂者，即照為義。	而大寂者，即照為義。	And the great quiescence is the meaning of illumination.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a02_4']	至寂即照、照而常寂。	至寂即照、照而常寂。	The ultimate quiescence is illumination, and illumination is always quiescent.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a03_4']	夫唯照而常寂，故雖動而彌寂，則其照無窮。	夫唯照而常寂，故雖動而彌寂，則其照無窮。	Only because it is illumination and always quiescent, although moving it is still quiescent, then its illumination is inexhaustible.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a04_2']	寂而常照，故即靜以言照，則其應無礙。	寂而常照，故即靜以言照，則其應無礙。	Being quiescent and always illuminating, therefore, if it is said to illuminate by stillness, then its response is unobstructed.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a04_18']	亦猶虛室之能容，般若之能照者也。	亦猶虛室之能容，般若之能照者也。	It is also like the empty room that can accommodate, and the prajna that can illuminate.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a05_9']	次約觀顯者，義當觀心。	次約觀顯者，義當觀心。	Next, in terms of revealing through contemplation, the meaning corresponds to contemplating the mind.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a05_15']	文先立境觀。	文先立境觀。	The text first establishes the realm and contemplation.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a06_7']	初四句謂室空，本一境也。	初四句謂室空，本一境也。	The first four sentences refer to the empty room, which is originally a single realm.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a06_20']	明暗自殊者，對暗立明觀也。	明暗自殊者，對暗立明觀也。	Light and darkness are distinct from each other means observing the establishment of light in contrast to darkness.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a07_10']	雖明暗殊而境常自若也。	雖明暗殊而境常自若也。	Although light and darkness are different, the realm is always as it is.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a08_2']	次四句略提法譬可知。	次四句略提法譬可知。	The next four sentences briefly bring up the analogy, which can be understood.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a09_6']	「日出」下四句正合，謂智生故境顯，猶日出則萬象俱明；	「日出」下四句正合，謂智生故境顯，猶日出則萬象俱明；	The four sentences beginning with When the sun rises directly apply the analogy, meaning that when wisdom arises, the realm becomes apparent, just as when the sun rises, myriad forms become illuminated;
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a10_2']	惑暗故心昏，譬日入則一無所睹。	惑暗故心昏，譬日入則一無所睹。	when deluded darkness obscures the mind, it is like when the sun sets and nothing can be seen.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a11_14']	亦如太虛本非明暗而明暗相除，此猶惑智相翻而理性常即，亦圓義也。	亦如太虛本非明暗而明暗相除，此猶惑智相翻而理性常即，亦圓義也。	It is also like the original nature of the great void being neither light nor dark, yet light and darkness eliminate each other. This is still the constant identity of the principle of reality while delusion and wisdom transform each other, which is also the meaning of perfection.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a13_18']	若夫明暗雖殊而性常清淨，則又直約不思議境體以示圓極，所謂明暗不相際顯出佛菩提是也。	若夫明暗雖殊而性常清淨，則又直約不思議境體以示圓極，所謂明暗不相際顯出佛菩提是也。	As for light and darkness being different yet the nature always being pure and clean, this directly uses the essence of the inconceivable realm to demonstrate perfection, which is to say, Light and darkness do not meet, revealing the Buddha's enlightenment.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a15_3']	故引證云云，謂無明雖染，而性即是明，不少一法也。	故引證云云，謂無明雖染，而性即是明，不少一法也。	Therefore, the confirmation states and so forth, meaning that although ignorance is defiled, its nature is precisely enlightenment, not lacking a single dharma.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a16_4']	所以一切眾生即菩提相，不可復滅者，恐誤。	所以一切眾生即菩提相，不可復滅者，恐誤。	The reason why all sentient beings are the characteristics of bodhi and cannot be extinguished again is probably a mistake.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a16_21']	文應作「得」，亦可從略，文互顯耳。	文應作「得」，亦可從略，文互顯耳。	The text should be written as obtain, or it can be abbreviated, and the text is mutually illuminating.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a17_17']	以其直下當體即是，更無一絲毫可加損故也。	以其直下當體即是，更無一絲毫可加損故也。	Because it is precisely the essence itself, and there is not a single hair that can be added or subtracted.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a19_6']	思緣放光者，若作事解，只是思可度緣放光發起，其義猶近。	思緣放光者，若作事解，只是思可度緣放光發起，其義猶近。	As for the light emitted by thoughts, if one understands it as an event, it is just emitting light to inspire those who are to be saved, and the meaning is still close.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a21_8']	今疏約理釋，則曰云云，是則無思而思、思於無相，無緣而緣、緣於法性，此其為自受用大樂也。	今疏約理釋，則曰云云，是則無思而思、思於無相，無緣而緣、緣於法性，此其為自受用大樂也。	Now, the commentary explains it in terms of principle, saying and so on. This means that without thought there is thought, thinking of the signless; without conditions there are conditions, conditioning the nature of dharmas. This is the great bliss of self-enjoyment.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a22_2']	若乃法本無相，思之則相生；	若乃法本無相，思之則相生；	If the Dharma is originally signless, thinking of it gives rise to signs;
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a22_13']	性本無緣，緣之則性起。	性本無緣，緣之則性起。	The nature is originally without conditions, conditioning it gives rise to the nature.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a23_2']	夫然則何思何慮哉？	夫然則何思何慮哉？	If this is so, then what thought and what consideration?
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a23_13']	特是為機緣故不思而得。	特是為機緣故不思而得。	It is precisely for the sake of the conditions that one obtains without thinking.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a26_9']	放光現瑞至於地六種動，發起眾疑，波斯匿王心知其然，唯佛能決，而如來在定未容遽請，於是聲種種美妙音樂警諸大眾。	放光現瑞至於地六種動，發起眾疑，波斯匿王心知其然，唯佛能決，而如來在定未容遽請，於是聲種種美妙音樂警諸大眾。	Emitting light and manifesting auspicious signs, up to the earth shaking in six ways, giving rise to various doubts. King Prasenajit knew this to be so, and only the Buddha could resolve it. But since the Tathāgata was in concentration, he could not abruptly request [an explanation]. Therefore, he used various beautiful and wonderful music to alert the great assembly.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a27_18']	由是如來從定而起，升于法座，而後正宗得以啟也，如經云云。	由是如來從定而起，升于法座，而後正宗得以啟也，如經云云。	Thus, the Tathāgata arose from concentration, ascended the Dharma seat, and only then could the main part of the sūtra be opened, as stated in the sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a28_20']	「問無色界者」下，覆問光必照色，無色何以為照？	「問無色界者」下，覆問光必照色，無色何以為照？	Those in the formless realm - the question is that light must illuminate form, so why is it said to illuminate the formless realm?
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297a29_16']	答中雖無麁色而有細色，此順問答也。	答中雖無麁色而有細色，此順問答也。	The answer is that although there is no coarse form, there is subtle form. This is the answer that accords with the question.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297b01_7']	若論佛光，有無皆照。	若論佛光，有無皆照。	If discussing the Buddha's light, it illuminates both existence and non-existence.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297b02_7']	抑佛光本以無相之照照無色色，殆問非也。	抑佛光本以無相之照照無色色，殆問非也。	Moreover, the Buddha's light originally uses the illumination of signlessness to illuminate the formless form. The question is almost wrong.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297b03_3']	而細色之言，唯天眼見，非肉眼所及。	而細色之言，唯天眼見，非肉眼所及。	As for the words subtle form, only the heavenly eye can see it, not the physical eye.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297b04_14']	此兼言二乘不見者，以二乘慧眼照空亦不能見，必獲天眼乃見之爾。	此兼言二乘不見者，以二乘慧眼照空亦不能見，必獲天眼乃見之爾。	The phrase the two vehicles do not see is because the wisdom eye of the two vehicles illuminates emptiness and is also unable to see. They must attain the heavenly eye in order to see it.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0297b07_12']	又《大經》云「無色界色非諸聲聞緣覺所知」者，以法法皆妙言之，不同論所明無色界色有無不定謂之宗計者，是皆不可一概言也。	又《大經》云「無色界色非諸聲聞緣覺所知」者，以法法皆妙言之，不同論所明無色界色有無不定謂之宗計者，是皆不可一概言也。	Moreover, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, The form of the formless realm is not known by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. This is said because all dharmas are wondrous. It is not the same as the theories that explain the existence or non-existence of form in the formless realm, which are called sectarian views.

Although those kings had this intention, it was merely a stimulus to the Buddha, and the Buddha opened up the two protections beyond their stimulus, which is even more profound.

['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b01_2']	初分科、次廣釋云云。	初分科、次廣釋云云。	First, the outline, and second, the extensive explanation.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b04_2']	然以五忍答初問者，謂伏忍等五是菩薩法，約位始終各分三品，一一有增進之相，而位不定住，合俱空之旨安於諦理，故通得稱忍。	然以五忍答初問者，謂伏忍等五是菩薩法，約位始終各分三品，一一有增進之相，而位不定住，合俱空之旨安於諦理，故通得稱忍。	Now, using the five forbearances to answer the first question means that the five forbearances such as the forbearance of subjugation are the Dharma of bodhisattvas. Each stage is divided into three levels, each with the aspect of progress, but the stages are not fixed. The meaning of the union of emptiness is peacefully established in the truth, so they can all be called forbearances.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b04_18']	是為菩薩行之所依，則行於可行也。	是為菩薩行之所依，則行於可行也。	This is the basis of the bodhisattva practice, which is practicing what can be practiced.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b06_9']	廣釋中，疏以五忍與六種性合釋，及所斷惑相文義交加，頗不易明。	廣釋中，疏以五忍與六種性合釋，及所斷惑相文義交加，頗不易明。	In the extensive explanation, the commentary combines the five forbearances with the six kinds of natures, and the text and meaning of the afflictions to be eliminated are intertwined, which is quite difficult to understand.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b07_2']	應先出異相，而後得以會之。	應先出異相，而後得以會之。	One should first point out the differences and then reconcile them.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b08_15']	所以異相者，據常所釋，別教初地證道同圓，已破無明即能分身百界作佛。	所以異相者，據常所釋，別教初地證道同圓，已破無明即能分身百界作佛。	The reason for the differences is based on the usual interpretation that the initial ground of the Distinct Teaching's realization of the Way is the same as the Perfect Teaching, and one can already manifest one's body in a hundred realms and become a Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b10_16']	而此經所出十地乃分為四，謂前三後一以對十地，則前二猶是信順二忍，後三始破無明。	而此經所出十地乃分為四，謂前三後一以對十地，則前二猶是信順二忍，後三始破無明。	However, the ten grounds presented in this sūtra are divided into four, with the first three and the last one corresponding to the ten grounds, then the first two are still the two forbearances of faith and compliance, and the last three just begin to break through ignorance.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b11_17']	若然，則與初地證道同圓分果垂迹其異，一也。	若然，則與初地證道同圓分果垂迹其異，一也。	If so, then the realization of the initial ground is the same as the Perfect Teaching in manifesting the traces of the provisional results, the first difference.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b13_9']	又所斷惑，信順二忍止斷三界色心麁重煩惱，此與常途有異，二也。	又所斷惑，信順二忍止斷三界色心麁重煩惱，此與常途有異，二也。	Moreover, in terms of the delusions to be eliminated, the two forbearances of faith and compliance only eliminate the coarse and heavy afflictions of form and mind in the three realms, which is different from the usual interpretation, the second difference.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b13_18']	於此須知教證二途：	於此須知教證二途：	Here one must understand the two approaches of teaching and realization:
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b14_12']	約證道論，固當如向同圓是也。	約證道論，固當如向同圓是也。	In terms of the approach of realization, it should indeed be the same as the Perfect Teaching as mentioned above.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b16_15']	今取教道為義，不妨十地殊品，故所破惑義有進否，是應義立無生忍位分上中下，如今文是也。	今取教道為義，不妨十地殊品，故所破惑義有進否，是應義立無生忍位分上中下，如今文是也。	Now, taking the teaching path as the meaning, it does not hinder the different categories of the ten grounds. Therefore, the meaning of the delusions to be eliminated has progress and decline. This is the establishment of the meaning of the stage of accepting non-arising, which is divided into superior, middling, and inferior, as in the present text.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b18_11']	以其根有利鈍，利者於初三品即破無明，其次中三始破，又其次者後三方破。	以其根有利鈍，利者於初三品即破無明，其次中三始破，又其次者後三方破。	Because their faculties are sharp or dull. The sharp ones break through ignorance in the first three categories. The next middling ones begin to break through. The next inferior ones break through in the last three.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b19_3']	既許初破，不妨證與圓同。	既許初破，不妨證與圓同。	Since it is allowed that the first [category] is broken through, it does not hinder the realization being the same as the perfect [teaching].
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b19_20']	其次未斷，猶居信順，亦影略互顯爾。	其次未斷，猶居信順，亦影略互顯爾。	The next [category] that has not yet been eliminated still abides in faith and understanding. It is also the mutual manifestation of the shadow and abbreviation.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b21_1']	至於後三斷位方定，猶下根受接其位定故是也。	至於後三斷位方定，猶下根受接其位定故是也。	As for the stage of breaking through in the last three [categories], it is only then determined. It is like the inferior [category] receiving the connection, and the stage is then determined.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b22_14']	而所破惑雖分色心麁細之異，於其利者即是無明，鈍即見思，復何固必？	而所破惑雖分色心麁細之異，於其利者即是無明，鈍即見思，復何固必？	Although the delusions to be eliminated are divided into the differences of coarseness and subtlety of form and mind, for the sharp [category] it is just ignorance, and for the dull [category] it is just views and thoughts. What is so insistent about it?
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b24_15']	況復悉檀被物初無定法，說有殊途，母以名相為惑，有志學者所宜盡心，如其不然置之可也。	況復悉檀被物初無定法，說有殊途，母以名相為惑，有志學者所宜盡心，如其不然置之可也。	How much more so for the four siddhāntas that adapt to beings, which are originally without fixed dharmas. Speaking of different paths, using names and characteristics to create confusion, those with the aspiration to study should devote their whole mind to it. If it is not so, then it can be put aside.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b25_18']	經言發相信者，位當別信，即發起信心之前相也。	經言發相信者，位當別信，即發起信心之前相也。	The sūtra says to give rise to faith and understanding, the stage corresponds to separate faith, which is the prior appearance of giving rise to the mind of faith.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b27_11']	疏亦作想，所謂理具此相，依理起想等，亦其義也，但與今圓別異耳云云。	疏亦作想，所謂理具此相，依理起想等，亦其義也，但與今圓別異耳云云。	The commentary also writes it as thought, referring to the principle of possessing these characteristics, relying on principle to give rise to thought, and so on, which is also its meaning, but it is different from the present perfect.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301b29_8']	伏忍之初，十住是也，據位格量猶是二乘，而言超過者，約知中智解能伏無明故也。	伏忍之初，十住是也，據位格量猶是二乘，而言超過者，約知中智解能伏無明故也。	The beginning of the patience of accepting the non-arising of dharmas is the ten abodes. According to the stage, it is still the two vehicles, but it is said to surpass because it is about the wisdom of understanding the middle that can subdue ignorance.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c01_13']	疏又約圓信釋者，或恐取同除四住此處為齊之文釋也。	疏又約圓信釋者，或恐取同除四住此處為齊之文釋也。	The commentary also explains it in terms of perfect faith, perhaps taking the same text that says to eliminate the four abodes, this is the level of equality to explain it.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c02_20']	然而彼以伏無明為過，此以斷為過，其義既通，進退無咎。	然而彼以伏無明為過，此以斷為過，其義既通，進退無咎。	However, they take subduing ignorance as surpassing, while this takes severing as surpassing. Since the meaning is already inclusive, there is no fault in advancing or retreating.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c03_16']	亦為接下長養聖胎義便故，從容於此。	亦為接下長養聖胎義便故，從容於此。	It is also convenient for the meaning of receiving and nurturing the holy embryo below, so I take my time here.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c04_14']	若論出胎，合在分真，或別有意云云。	若論出胎，合在分真，或別有意云云。	If discussing the birth of the embryo, it should be in the stage of partial truth, or there may be a separate meaning, and so on.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c05_15']	此下疏文疑多一「二」字，文末當云出聖胎也。	此下疏文疑多一「二」字，文末當云出聖胎也。	Below this, the commentary text seems to have an extra two character. At the end of the text, it should say giving birth to the holy embryo.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c06_15']	「起乾慧」下，未有理水，本當聞慧之初，故云乾慧。	「起乾慧」下，未有理水，本當聞慧之初，故云乾慧。	Arousing dry wisdom is below, without the water of principle, it should be at the beginning of hearing wisdom, so it is called dry wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c08_6']	今在思修位中言者，恐是仍前之說，故起自乾慧，其實正當伏忍位也。	今在思修位中言者，恐是仍前之說，故起自乾慧，其實正當伏忍位也。	Now, it is said to be in the stage of contemplation and cultivation, I am afraid it is still the previous explanation, so it starts from dry wisdom. In reality, it is precisely in the stage of patient acceptance of subjugation.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c08_19']	疏判位本當，但釋名差間耳。	疏判位本當，但釋名差間耳。	The commentary's judgment of the stage should be just a difference in the explanation of the name.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c09_5']	疑多一結句。	疑多一結句。	It seems to have an extra concluding sentence.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c09_22']	「千」字之非，經既已正，殆無用耳。	「千」字之非，經既已正，殆無用耳。	The error in the character thousand has already been corrected in the sutra, and is almost useless.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c11_9']	亦有十心通名為意，所以四意止，念處，於身受心法令不起邪倒故。	亦有十心通名為意，所以四意止，念處，於身受心法令不起邪倒故。	There are also ten mental states collectively called intention. The reason for the four intentions is to prevent wrong views from arising regarding the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c12_4']	三意止，三善根，令不起三毒故。	三意止，三善根，令不起三毒故。	The three foundations of mindfulness and the three roots of goodness are to prevent the arising of the three poisons.

['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c13_22']	「復有」下，明十向，即道種性位。	「復有」下，明十向，即道種性位。	Furthermore, below, it clarifies the ten directions, which is the stage of the seed nature of the path.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c14_12']	亦由修上伏忍，進入平等道。	亦由修上伏忍，進入平等道。	It is also due to cultivating the above forbearance of subduing and progressing to the equal path.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c15_9']	與初地聖道為因，皆仍前望後之說。	與初地聖道為因，皆仍前望後之說。	It is the cause for the holy path of the first ground, all still speaking of the previous in relation to the later.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c16_7']	則又有十種忍等，以觀對忍，次第可知。	則又有十種忍等，以觀對忍，次第可知。	Then there are also ten kinds of forbearances and so forth, using contemplation to correspond with forbearance, the sequence can be known.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c18_5']	初觀色陰得戒忍者，謂作無作戒本陰色攝，故觀色陰發於戒忍，然不言色攝所以。	初觀色陰得戒忍者，謂作無作戒本陰色攝，故觀色陰發於戒忍，然不言色攝所以。	The first, contemplating the form aggregate and attaining the forbearance of precepts, means that precepts with and without form are originally included in the form aggregate, therefore, contemplating the form aggregate gives rise to the forbearance of precepts. However, it does not say why form is included.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c18_12']	此如別論云云。	此如別論云云。	This is like the separate treatises say.

['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c21_1']	亦可因想入定，受以法慧，行以空脫，識為心王而能發受等，故前後不定。	亦可因想入定，受以法慧，行以空脫，識為心王而能發受等，故前後不定。	It can also be said that based on thought one enters concentration, feeling is Dharma wisdom, practice is empty liberation, and consciousness is the mind king that can give rise to feeling and so forth, so the sequence is not fixed.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c21_20']	觀三界因果空故，得空等三忍，如疏可知。	觀三界因果空故，得空等三忍，如疏可知。	Contemplating the emptiness of the causes and effects of the three realms, one attains the three forbearances of emptiness and so forth, as can be known from the commentary.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c22_14']	通觀二諦，了法無常，名無常忍。	通觀二諦，了法無常，名無常忍。	Contemplating the two truths, understanding that phenomena are impermanent, is called the forbearance of impermanence.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c23_4']	達一切法空，名無生忍。	達一切法空，名無生忍。	Penetrating all phenomena as empty is called the forbearance of non-arising.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c24_9']	然十向猶是道種性，雖未無生而得在不久，是故云也。	然十向猶是道種性，雖未無生而得在不久，是故云也。	However, the ten dedications are still the stage of the seeds of the path. Although there is no non-arising yet, one will attain it before long, and therefore it is said.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c25_4']	又約無常等判二忍者，亦一往耳。	又約無常等判二忍者，亦一往耳。	Moreover, judging the two forbearances based on impermanence and so forth is also just a general statement.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c26_18']	自別行位言之，亦可觀無常則安於無常、觀無生則安於無生，初無定在也。	自別行位言之，亦可觀無常則安於無常、觀無生則安於無生，初無定在也。	From the perspective of the separate practices and stages, it can also be said that contemplating impermanence is being at ease with impermanence, and contemplating non-arising is being at ease with non-arising, with no fixed order.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c28_2']	是菩薩十堅心者，不出由前十忍成堅忍之德云爾。	是菩薩十堅心者，不出由前十忍成堅忍之德云爾。	This bodhisattva's ten firm minds means that based on the previous ten forbearances, one achieves the virtue of firm forbearance.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0301c28_14']	「又信忍」下，標起忍位。	「又信忍」下，標起忍位。	Moreover, the forbearance of faith and below introduces the stage of forbearance.

['ZH_T33_1706_003:0302a05_4']	若據證道同圓，合斷界外根本無明，已如前示。	若據證道同圓，合斷界外根本無明，已如前示。	If based on the realization of the path being the same as the perfect teaching, one should sever the fundamental ignorance of the realm beyond the three realms. This has already been shown above.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0302a06_12']	而此復言心煩惱者，當是前所謂色等單約色心說，今約色心。	而此復言心煩惱者，當是前所謂色等單約色心說，今約色心。	However, this again mentions the afflictions of the mind. This must be what was previously called form, etc., which only discusses form and mind. Now it discusses form and mind together.

Only when the characteristics of the exhaustion of habitual ignorance are distinguished later can the active and habitual [afflictions] be distinguished. It is said that each has its corresponding stage.

['ZH_T33_1706_003:0302a12_2']	攝化中言一身多身者，疏謂化身實有之異，然亦只是常途所謂分身百界千界等。	攝化中言一身多身者，疏謂化身實有之異，然亦只是常途所謂分身百界千界等。	In the section on embracing and transforming, the commentary states that the bodies of transformation are different in reality, but they are also just the usual so-called divided bodies in the hundred realms and the thousand realms, etc.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0302a14_10']	既曰分果，自然無量身一身、一身無量身，但約位淺深，故以本從末則一身無量身，以末從本則無量身一身。	既曰分果，自然無量身一身、一身無量身，但約位淺深，故以本從末則一身無量身，以末從本則無量身一身。	Since it is said to be the divided result, there are naturally innumerable bodies and one body, and one body and innumerable bodies. But based on the shallowness and depth of the stage, using the fundamental to follow the branches, there is one body and innumerable bodies. Using the branches to follow the fundamental, there are innumerable bodies and one body.

The analogy in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra can be compared to the vajra-like wisdom samādhi in this sūtra, which can destroy afflictions while its own essence is indestructible, as the sūtra says.

If wisdom does not disappear by itself, then the true essence of prajñā is not self-luminous. This exhaustion of characteristics must further exhaust the exhauster, only then can it be called sarvajña.

As the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra says, There is no self, no creator, and no experiencer, but the karma of good and evil is not lost.

The previous forbearance of faith is the thirty minds divided into three, along with the first nine grounds, making twelve. The peak is above them, which is being above the twelve Dharma masters.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0305b10_16']	寂滅忍亦三品，下中即十地灌頂，望妙覺才一間耳，故曰一轉即入妙覺上品也。	寂滅忍亦三品，下中即十地灌頂，望妙覺才一間耳，故曰一轉即入妙覺上品也。	The forbearance of quiescent extinction also has three grades. The lower and middle are the ten grounds and the peak empowerment. Looking up to the wondrous enlightenment, it is only one step away. Therefore, it is said that one turn enters the upper grade of wondrous enlightenment.

That is to say, what is now eliminated are the remaining habits of the previous correct afflictions, which are the final conditions of ignorance. Without ultimate wisdom, they cannot be eliminated.
['ZH_T33_1706_003:0305b16_11']	然皆出於根本無明，故曰習相有異新熏。	然皆出於根本無明，故曰習相有異新熏。	However, they all come from the fundamental ignorance, so it is said that the characteristics of the habits are different and newly perfumed.

That is to say, in the prose, the text of the five forbearances is brief, and it is only combined with the forty-two stages to be illuminated.

If it is said to be the ten grounds, then the cause emerges and the effect submerges. If it is said to be wondrous enlightenment, it is the opposite. Therefore, it is said that the great sage turns the text according to the capacities of beings, and the meaning is initially not fixed.

Together they form one section. If the previous three rounds of questions and answers are moved into this section, then the meaning of the text is quite in accord.
