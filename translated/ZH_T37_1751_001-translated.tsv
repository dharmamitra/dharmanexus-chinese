The Great Master preemptively takes them to explain the title of the sūtra, wishing to enable practitioners to use this to view the dharmas and enter the sixteen gates as cultivation and realization. Therefore, in the preface text, the main [teaching] encompasses the many, and the proper [teaching] includes the dependent.

These two are no different, and this is precisely the contemplation of now.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c05_5']	良以圓解全異小乘，小昧唯心，佛從外有，是故心佛其體不同。	良以圓解全異小乘，小昧唯心，佛從外有，是故心佛其體不同。	001	This is because the perfect understanding is completely different from the Hīnayāna. The Hīnayāna is ignorant of the mind-only, and the Buddha exists externally. Therefore, the mind and the Buddha have different substances.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c06_8']	大乘行人知我一心具諸佛性，託境修觀佛相乃彰。	大乘行人知我一心具諸佛性，託境修觀佛相乃彰。	001	The practitioners of the Mahāyāna know that their one mind possesses the nature of all Buddhas. Relying on the realm to cultivate contemplation, the appearance of the Buddha becomes manifest.

['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c08_7']	心具而生，豈離心性？	心具而生，豈離心性？	001	Since it arises from the inherent nature of the mind, how can it be separate from the nature of the mind?
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c10_4']	全心是佛、全佛是心，終日觀心、終日觀佛，是故經目與疏立宗，語雖不同，其義無別。	全心是佛、全佛是心，終日觀心、終日觀佛，是故經目與疏立宗，語雖不同，其義無別。	001	The entire mind is Buddha, and the entire Buddha is mind. All day long contemplating the mind is all day long contemplating the Buddha. Therefore, although the title of the sūtra and the establishment of the main point in the commentary differ in words, their meanings are no different.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c12_7']	又應須了，若觀佛者必須照心，若專觀心未必託佛，如一行三昧直觀一念，不託他佛而為所緣。	又應須了，若觀佛者必須照心，若專觀心未必託佛，如一行三昧直觀一念，不託他佛而為所緣。	001	Moreover, it should be understood that if one contemplates the Buddha, one must illuminate the mind. If one exclusively contemplates the mind, it is not necessarily based on the Buddha. Like the single practice samādhi, one directly contemplates a single thought, not relying on another Buddha as the object of concentration.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c14_1']	若彼般舟及此觀法，發軫即觀安養依正，而觀依正不離心性，故曰心觀。	若彼般舟及此觀法，發軫即觀安養依正，而觀依正不離心性，故曰心觀。	001	If one practices the Pratyutpanna Samādhi or this contemplation method, one begins by contemplating the pure land of peace and happiness, and in contemplating the pure land, one does not depart from the nature of the mind. Therefore, it is called the contemplation of the mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c15_8']	須知此觀不專觀心，內外分之，此當外觀，以由託彼依正觀故。	須知此觀不專觀心，內外分之，此當外觀，以由託彼依正觀故。	001	One must know that this contemplation is not exclusively the contemplation of the mind. When divided into internal and external, it belongs to the external contemplation, because it is based on the contemplation of the pure land.

Although one cultivates the Buddha contemplation, it is not considered difficult.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0197c20_12']	是知今經心觀為宗，意在見佛，故得二說義匪殊途。	是知今經心觀為宗，意在見佛，故得二說義匪殊途。	001	Therefore, we know that the mind contemplation is the main principle of this sūtra, and the intention is to see the Buddha. Thus, the two explanations are not different in meaning.

It also completely constitutes sentient beings, Buddhas, the environment, the beings, faculties, objects, a single mind, a single particle, up to a single atom, all of which are the entire essence of the Dharma realm.

Compared to the sudden-within-sudden teaching, they are as far apart as heaven and earth. They are still inferior to them, so how could they be included in this teaching?
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0198a03_6']	」以一切法一一皆具一切法故，是故今家立於唯色唯香等義。	」以一切法一一皆具一切法故，是故今家立於唯色唯香等義。	001	 Because all dharmas each and every one possess all dharmas, therefore our school establishes the meaning of only form, only fragrance, and so on.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0198a04_9']	若其然者，何故經論多以一心為諸法總立觀境邪？	若其然者，何故經論多以一心為諸法總立觀境邪？	001	If that is so, why do the sūtras and treatises often take the one mind as the general object of observation for all dharmas?

The middle way necessarily illuminates the three truths together and is complete, so it is said that the contemplation of the mind in this sutra is the principle, and the essence of reality is the essence.

It also says: Being protected and cared for by the Buddha, planting the seeds of virtue, entering the assembly of right concentration, giving rise to the mind of saving all sentient beings.

Each siddhānta uses words, and each word does not depart from the siddhānta.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0199a17_4']	如以名實對理通別，多名不離一實、一實不妨多名，故三通別皆悉同時。	如以名實對理通別，多名不離一實、一實不妨多名，故三通別皆悉同時。	001	As the principle is distinguished by the name and reality, many names do not depart from one reality, and one reality does not obstruct many names. Therefore, the three common and distinguished are all simultaneous.

The four teachings and four approaches all explain the one principle. If one is exclusively focused on the vaipulya and is not yet able to hear this, then this is preemptively taking the meaning of the Lotus Sutra and speaking across the joints.

The entire essence of all provisional and actual beings, the three vehicles, humans and gods, down to the form and mind of the lowest insects and hell beings, all must be distinguished in terms of the six identities, namely, the principle of insects, the name, up to the ultimate insects.

As for phenomena, there are reversals and accordances. The five from names and phrases onward are phenomena of accordant cultivation, while only the identity of principle is pure phenomena of contrary cultivation.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0200b03_15']	此逆順事，與本覺理體皆不二，其逆順名自何而立？	此逆順事，與本覺理體皆不二，其逆順名自何而立？	001	This contrary and accordant phenomena, and the principle of original enlightenment, are all non-dual. From what does the names of contrary and accordant arise?
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0200b04_11']	以知不二，事皆合理，名之為順。	以知不二，事皆合理，名之為順。	001	Because of knowing non-duality, phenomena all accord with principle, which is called accordant.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0200b05_4']	其不知者，事皆違理，故名為逆。	其不知者，事皆違理，故名為逆。	001	Those who do not know it, phenomena all go against principle, and are therefore called contrary.

['ZH_T37_1751_001:0200b09_13']	性染性惡全體起作，修染修惡更無別體。	性染性惡全體起作，修染修惡更無別體。	001	The entire essence of the nature's defilement and evil gives rise to cultivation, defilement, and evil, which have no separate essence.

['ZH_T37_1751_001:0200b16_1']	又理即佛，非於事外指理為佛，蓋言三障理全是佛。	又理即佛，非於事外指理為佛，蓋言三障理全是佛。	001	Furthermore, the principle of being a Buddha is not pointing to the principle as the Buddha outside of phenomena. It is said that the principle of the three obstacles is entirely the Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1751_001:0200b17_17']	又復應知，不名障即佛而名理即佛者，欲障後五有修德是，此之一位唯理性是也。	又復應知，不名障即佛而名理即佛者，欲障後五有修德是，此之一位唯理性是也。	001	Moreover, it should be known that it is not called the obstacles being the Buddha, but rather the principle being the Buddha. This is because the five subsequent stages of cultivation are the virtues of cultivation, while this stage is only the principle of nature.
