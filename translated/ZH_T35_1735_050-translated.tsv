['ZH_T35_1735_050:0883b22_1']	後總結雙非，不離不斷。	後總結雙非，不離不斷。	050	Later, it concludes by summarizing both the non-differentiation and the non-separation.

['ZH_T35_1735_050:0883c29_7']	一文字無盡喻，喻第九無盡；	一文字無盡喻，喻第九無盡；	050	The first is the analogy of the inexhaustibility of written words, which illustrates the ninth inexhaustible;
