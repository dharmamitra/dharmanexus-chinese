['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c17_6']	二又說佛法功力等。	二又說佛法功力等。	Second, it also says that the power of the Buddha Dharma, etc.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c18_5']	四又但總言等下是。	四又但總言等下是。	Fourth, it only generally says, etc., which is below.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c18_10']	斷如燈辨。	斷如燈辨。	Elimination is like the explanation of a lamp.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c19_14']	此所知障不與異熟識俱等者。	此所知障不與異熟識俱等者。	This obstacle to that which is to be known is not concomitant with the consciousness of karmic maturation, etc.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c19_19']	此中三因。	此中三因。	There are three causes here.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c20_4', 'ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c20_15']	佛地論同。🔽彼云一切異熟無記心品。	佛地論同。 彼云一切異熟無記心品。	The Buddha Land Treatise is the same.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c21_5']	分別力劣不能執故。	分別力劣不能執故。	It says: All types of consciousness that are karmically mature and indeterminate cannot grasp because their discriminating power is inferior.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c22_1']	若有倒執成法我見有無明等。	若有倒執成法我見有無明等。	If there is inverted grasping, it becomes the view of dharmas and self, with ignorance, etc.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c22_10']	不應唯與五法相應。	不應唯與五法相應。	It should not only be concomitant with the five dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c22_15']	有見等故。	有見等故。	Because there is the view, etc.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c23_10']	又法空觀初現前時此識應斷。	又法空觀初現前時此識應斷。	Moreover, when the contemplation of the emptiness of dharmas first manifests, this consciousness should be eliminated.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c24_4']	障治相違不俱行故　釋曰。	障治相違不俱行故　釋曰。	Because the obstacles and their antidotes are incompatible and do not operate together. The commentary says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c24_16']	佛地初因通一切異熟之心。	佛地初因通一切異熟之心。	The first cause in the Buddha Land is common to all karmically mature minds.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c25_2']	非唯第八。	非唯第八。	Not only the eighth.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c25_11']	或此亦兼明餘異熟。	或此亦兼明餘異熟。	Or this also clarifies the other karmic maturations.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c26_13']	又下異熟心至不可為例者。	又下異熟心至不可為例者。	Moreover, the lower ripening mind... cannot be used as an analogy.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c26_18']	此設遮也。	此設遮也。	This is a hypothetical refutation.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c27_3']	設彼例云。	設彼例云。	Hypothetically, it could be argued:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c27_12']	若眼等識是異熟心。	若眼等識是異熟心。	If the eye consciousness and so forth are ripening minds,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c28_3']	不有法執法空智俱。	不有法執法空智俱。	they do not have the grasping of dharmas and are concomitant with the wisdom of the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c28_12']	四無記中異熟無記。	四無記中異熟無記。	Among the four indeterminate [minds], the indeterminate ripening [mind],
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c29_3']	一切應與法空智俱。	一切應與法空智俱。	all should be concomitant with the wisdom of the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0959c29_12']	皆無法執如第八等。	皆無法執如第八等。	They all do not have the grasping of dharmas, like the eighth consciousness and so forth.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a01_3']	故今答意異熟名同。	故今答意異熟名同。	Therefore, the meaning of the answer now is that the name ripening is the same,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a01_13']	執．不執別不可為例。	執．不執別不可為例。	but the distinction between grasping and not grasping cannot be used as an analogy.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a02_20']	故唯十三。	故唯十三。	Therefore, there are only thirteen.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a03_1']	論。	論。	The treatise.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a03_11']	煩惱障至為所依故者。	煩惱障至為所依故者。	The afflictive obstructions... serve as the basis.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a04_6']	按勝鬘經明所知障為煩惱依。	按勝鬘經明所知障為煩惱依。	According to the Śrīmālā-sūtra, it clarifies that the obstacle to that which is to be known serves as the basis for the afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a04_15']	文有法喻及合三段。	文有法喻及合三段。	The text has three parts: the principle, the analogy, and the combination.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a05_2']	如疏已引。	如疏已引。	As the commentary has already cited.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a06_6']	理旨奧隱遂難略釋　經於此起煩惱等者　釋曰。	理旨奧隱遂難略釋　經於此起煩惱等者　釋曰。	The meaning is profound and obscure, so it is difficult to briefly explain. The sūtra says arising from this, the afflictions... and so on. The explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a08_8']	於此無明地上所起現行煩惱於剎那頃必與無明剎那剎那相應而起　經世尊心不相應。	於此無明地上所起現行煩惱於剎那頃必與無明剎那剎那相應而起　經世尊心不相應。	The active afflictions that arise on this ground of ignorance must arise in each moment in association with the moments of ignorance. The sutra says: Not associated with the mind.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a09_1']	無始無明住地者　釋曰。	無始無明住地者　釋曰。	The ground of ignorance that has been beginningless.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a09_10']	無明地種名不相應。	無明地種名不相應。	The seeds of the ground of ignorance are called not associated.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a10_14']	意明無明同於煩惱通種現也　或相應者是共之義。	意明無明同於煩惱通種現也　或相應者是共之義。	It clarifies that ignorance is the same as the afflictions, both seeds and activity. Or, associated means together.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a11_9']	四住煩惱三乘同斷名曰相應。	四住煩惱三乘同斷名曰相應。	The four abodes of the afflictions are all eliminated by the three vehicles, and are called associated.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a12_15']	無明住地獨唯佛除名不相應　經過於恒沙等者　釋曰。	無明住地獨唯佛除名不相應　經過於恒沙等者　釋曰。	The ground of ignorance is eliminated only by the Buddha, and is called not associated. The sutra says: More numerous than the sands of the Ganges River...
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a13_10']	顯依無明煩惱無極名過恒沙。	顯依無明煩惱無極名過恒沙。	It clarifies that the afflictions based on ignorance are called more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a13_15']	餘文易悟。	餘文易悟。	The rest of the text is easy to understand.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a14_1']	論。	論。	The treatise says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a14_11']	體雖無異而用有別者。	體雖無異而用有別者。	Although the substance is not different, the functions are distinct.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a14_16']	用別有二。	用別有二。	The distinctions in function are twofold:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a15_2']	一現行用別。	一現行用別。	First, the distinction in the function of activity;
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a15_8']	二種子用別。	二種子用別。	Second, the distinction in the function of seeds.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a15_18']	有障菩提．涅槃用故。	有障菩提．涅槃用故。	Because it obstructs the function of bodhi and nirvana.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a16_3']	前解為本。	前解為本。	The former interpretation is the main point.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a16_8']	後理亦通。	後理亦通。	The latter principle is also correct.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a17_1']	論。	論。	Treatise.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a17_11']	故二隨眠斷惑前後者。	故二隨眠斷惑前後者。	Therefore, the two latent afflictions are eliminated in sequence.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a18_3']	問斷既前後何名體一。	問斷既前後何名體一。	Question: Since the elimination is sequential, how can they be said to be of the same essence?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a18_12']	二乘斷惑所知應斷。	二乘斷惑所知應斷。	The two vehicles eliminate the afflictions, and the knowable should also be eliminated.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a18_17']	以體一故。	以體一故。	Because they are of the same essence.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a19_11']	又十地中斷所知障煩惱應斷。	又十地中斷所知障煩惱應斷。	Moreover, in the ten grounds, the elimination of the knowable hindrances should also eliminate the afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a19_16']	一即體同。	一即體同。	The first is the same essence.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a21_2']	二契經言如地壞時種隨壞故　答有義種體雖一。	二契經言如地壞時種隨壞故　答有義種體雖一。	The second is in accordance with the sutra, which says that when the earth is destroyed, the seeds are also destroyed. Answer: There is an interpretation that although the essence of the seeds is one,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a21_11']	而有麁細共和合故。	而有麁細共和合故。	they are mixed together in a coarse and subtle way.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a22_6']	如金鐵等一物之中精麁異故。	如金鐵等一物之中精麁異故。	This is because within a single substance such as gold or iron, there are differences in refinement.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a23_5']	生空聖道力不及彼菩薩方便故留不斷。	生空聖道力不及彼菩薩方便故留不斷。	The power of the holy path of emptiness of beings is not as good as that of the bodhisattvas' skillful means, and therefore they retain and do not eliminate them.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a24_4']	經依見道．究竟道說故不相違　詳曰。	經依見道．究竟道說故不相違　詳曰。	The sutra speaks in terms of the path of seeing and the ultimate path, and therefore there is no contradiction. The detailed explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a24_13']	既以麁細和合成之。	既以麁細和合成之。	Since they are mixed together in a coarse and subtle way,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a24_18']	種體應假。	種體應假。	the essence of the seeds should be provisional.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a25_4']	如瓶衣等。	如瓶衣等。	Like a vase, clothing, and so forth.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a25_13']	假非因緣何得生現。	假非因緣何得生現。	How can a provisional [entity] that is not a cause and condition give rise to the present [dharmas]?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a25_18']	故今解云。	故今解云。	Therefore, the present explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a26_12']	用既有差斷彼一分用所依體。	用既有差斷彼一分用所依體。	Since there are differences in function, eliminating a part of the function of the basis of that [provisional seed].
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a27_3']	聖道功力有分限故。	聖道功力有分限故。	Because the power of the holy path has limitations.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a27_9']	故佛地論云。	故佛地論云。	Therefore the Buddha Land Treatise says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a27_18']	煩惱障中有所知障。	煩惱障中有所知障。	In the afflictive hindrances, there are the knowable hindrances.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a28_4']	是所依故。	是所依故。	Because they are the basis.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a28_13']	必執有法而計我故。	必執有法而計我故。	Necessarily grasping at the existence of dharmas and conceiving a self.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a29_4']	體雖無異然用有別。	體雖無異然用有別。	Although their substance is not different, their functions are distinct.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960a29_13']	如一識體取境多用。	如一識體取境多用。	Just as the substance of a single consciousness has many functions in grasping objects,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b01_4']	此熏種子體亦多用。	此熏種子體亦多用。	the substance of these perfumed seeds also has many functions.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b01_13']	起時雖俱而漸次斷。	起時雖俱而漸次斷。	When arising, although simultaneous, they are gradually eliminated.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b02_3']	聖道勢力有分限故。	聖道勢力有分限故。	Because the power of the holy path has limitations.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b02_8']	餘義同前。	餘義同前。	The other meanings are the same as before.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b03_1']	論。	論。	The treatise says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b03_12']	若所知障至無明住地者。	若所知障至無明住地者。	If the knowable hindrances are the seeds of the afflictive hindrances,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b03_17']	此以經難。	此以經難。	This uses the sutra to raise a difficulty.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b04_3']	經如疏引。	經如疏引。	The sutra is quoted in the commentary.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b04_8']	遂難略解。	遂難略解。	Then it raises a brief explanation.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b04_17']	言住及起二煩惱者。	言住及起二煩惱者。	The two afflictions of abiding and arising,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b05_3']	住謂種子。	住謂種子。	Abiding refers to seeds.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b05_8']	起是現行。	起是現行。	Arising is present activity.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b05_18']	或所依生處名為住地。	或所依生處名為住地。	Or the basis of arising is called the abode of abiding.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b06_3']	起謂現惑。	起謂現惑。	Arising refers to present afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b06_8']	正生起故。	正生起故。	Because they are correctly arising.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b06_17']	三界見惑而由見勝。	三界見惑而由見勝。	The views of the three realms are due to the superiority of views.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b07_4']	復見道斷故。	復見道斷故。	They are also eliminated by the path of seeing.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b07_12']	合言之見一處也。	合言之見一處也。	When combined, they are seen as one place.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b08_2']	三有俱生修道之惑。	三有俱生修道之惑。	The afflictions of the three realms that are cultivated in the path of cultivation,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b08_11']	潤生愛勝別分三種。	潤生愛勝別分三種。	Nourishing birth and love are superior, separately divided into three kinds.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b09_2']	非唯三界俱生但愛。	非唯三界俱生但愛。	It is not only the love of the three realms that is cultivated.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b09_9']	言無明住地者。	言無明住地者。	As for the stage of ignorance,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b10_8']	諸所知障皆能障智無明偏增總名無明。	諸所知障皆能障智無明偏增總名無明。	All the obstacles to omniscience are able to obstruct wisdom, and ignorance is especially increased, all of which are called ignorance.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b10_16']	言一切上煩惱者。	言一切上煩惱者。	As for all the higher afflictions,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b11_15']	前四住惑現種皆依無明地上名上煩惱。	前四住惑現種皆依無明地上名上煩惱。	The manifest and seeds of the previous four stages of afflictions all rely on the stage of ignorance, which is called the higher afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b12_1']	疏。	疏。	The commentary says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b12_11']	總名無明無品數故者。	總名無明無品數故者。	They are collectively called ignorance because there are no categories.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b12_16']	有義彈云。	有義彈云。	There is an interpretation that refutes this, saying:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b13_1']	此義不然。	此義不然。	This interpretation is not correct.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b13_6']	體同煩惱。	體同煩惱。	The substance is the same as the afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b13_15']	即如煩惱品數別故。	即如煩惱品數別故。	It is just like the afflictions, which have different categories.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b14_5']	但應說云行微細故。	但應說云行微細故。	It should only be said that they are subtle in their activity.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b14_17']	不染義同合為一住　詳曰。	不染義同合為一住　詳曰。	The meaning of non-defilement is the same, so they are combined into one stage.🔽The detailed explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b16_4']	不同煩惱地地九品分為麁細斷之前後言無品數。	不同煩惱地地九品分為麁細斷之前後言無品數。	They are not the same as the afflictions, which are divided into nine categories in each stage, becoming coarse and fine, with the words of before and after the cutting off having no categories.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b17_1']	非言無彼愛．恚等類名無品也。	非言無彼愛．恚等類名無品也。	It does not mean that there are no categories of love, hatred, and so forth, called having no categories.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b17_6']	故疏無違。	故疏無違。	Therefore the commentary is not contradictory.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b17_15']	若言不染義同合一。	若言不染義同合一。	If it is said that the undefiled [afflictions] have the same meaning as the defiled [afflictions] and are combined into one,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b18_9']	豈彼經中唯對二乘辨五住地。	豈彼經中唯對二乘辨五住地。	how can it be that in that sutra only the two vehicles are distinguished in terms of the five abodes?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b19_1']	若兼菩薩何唯不染。	若兼菩薩何唯不染。	If [the five abodes] are combined with bodhisattvas, how can they only be undefiled?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b19_10']	對彼菩薩是應染分。	對彼菩薩是應染分。	In relation to those bodhisattvas, they are the defiled part.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b20_1']	如煩惱障既不別開。	如煩惱障既不別開。	Just as the afflictive hindrances are not separately distinguished,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b20_10']	故知不約不染合也。	故知不約不染合也。	therefore it should be known that they are not combined in terms of the undefiled [afflictions].
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b21_1']	論。	論。	The treatise says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b21_12']	永斷二障至通有漏道者。	永斷二障至通有漏道者。	Permanently eliminating the two hindrances is common to the contaminated and uncontaminated paths.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b22_1', 'ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960b22_12']	有義彈疏釋云。🔽若爾二乘伏煩惱時同體。	有義彈疏釋云。 若爾二乘伏煩惱時同體。	There is an interpretation that refutes the commentary's explanation, saying:

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960c28_16']	由於大乘諸疑離疑。	由於大乘諸疑離疑。	Because of being free from doubt and without doubt regarding the great vehicle,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0960c29_11']	以能永斷異惠疑故者　釋曰。	以能永斷異惠疑故者　釋曰。	Because one is able to permanently eliminate doubt that is different from wisdom. The explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a01_3']	雖離於前二乘作意。	雖離於前二乘作意。	Although one has already left behind the attention of the two vehicles,

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a02_7']	後執一是便撥餘非。	後執一是便撥餘非。	Later, one grasps one as true and repudiates the others as false.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a03_3']	能撥邪惠與正惠殊故名異也。	能撥邪惠與正惠殊故名異也。	The heterodox wisdom that repudiates is different from the correct wisdom, and is therefore called different.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a03_12']	體即法執邪見所攝。	體即法執邪見所攝。	Its substance is included in the mistaken views of attachment to dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a03_17']	故世親云。	故世親云。	Therefore Vasubandhu says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a04_7']	此中異惠謂鄙惡惠。	此中異惠謂鄙惡惠。	Here, different wisdom refers to contemptible and evil wisdom.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a04_16']	於理動搖作三性觀。	於理動搖作三性觀。	It wavers regarding principles and makes distinctions between the three natures.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a05_10']	異惠及疑永不復轉名斷疑惠。	異惠及疑永不復轉名斷疑惠。	Different wisdom and doubt never arise again, and is called wisdom that eliminates doubt.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a07_7']	一云能斷彼疑名為離疑。	一云能斷彼疑名為離疑。	The first says: That which can eliminate doubt is called free from doubt.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a07_16']	二云諸疑即二乘人。	二云諸疑即二乘人。	The second says: Doubts refer to those of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a08_7']	離疑即是漸頓菩薩。	離疑即是漸頓菩薩。	Being free from doubt refers to the gradual and sudden bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a09_2']	三云不定諸小菩薩雖先發心。	三云不定諸小菩薩雖先發心。	The third says: The undetermined small bodhisattvas, although they have already given rise to the aspiration,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a09_11']	然於大行起懸崖想。	然於大行起懸崖想。	Yet regarding the great practices, they give rise to thoughts of a sheer cliff.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a10_2']	數數退屈遂起疑心。	數數退屈遂起疑心。	They frequently retreat and become discouraged, and thus give rise to doubts.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a10_11']	為得不得名為諸疑。	為得不得名為諸疑。	Whether or not they will attain [enlightenment] is called doubts.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a11_7', 'ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a12_10']	欲就二乘心生決定名為離疑。🔽四云諸小菩薩先於佛說顯．密三藏種種不同。	欲就二乘心生決定名為離疑。 四云諸小菩薩先於佛說顯．密三藏種種不同。	If one wishes to attain certainty in the minds of the two vehicles, it is called free from doubt.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a13_1']	而生疑惑名為諸疑。	而生疑惑名為諸疑。	Fourth, it is said that small bodhisattvas previously gave rise to doubt regarding the various differences in the explicit and implicit three treasuries taught by the Buddha, which is called various doubts.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a13_10']	後執一是斥餘為非。	後執一是斥餘為非。	Later, they upheld one as correct and refuted the others as wrong.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a14_1']	自為決定名為離疑。	自為決定名為離疑。	They themselves attained certainty, which is called free from doubt.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a15_9']	故本論云。	故本論云。	Therefore, the fundamental treatise says:

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a17_8']	下別釋中四種皆說能所二治。	下別釋中四種皆說能所二治。	In the specific explanations below, the four kinds all explain the two remedies of the able and the receptive.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a17_17']	若離疑言不目能治。	若離疑言不目能治。	If the word free from doubt does not refer to the able remedy,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a18_7']	第二將何為能治耶。	第二將何為能治耶。	what will the second take as the able remedy?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a19_3']	若言不說何故餘有此獨無耶。	若言不說何故餘有此獨無耶。	If it is said that it is not explained, why does the other have this and this one does not?🔽Therefore, the word free from doubt shows the able one.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a20_8']	故離疑言顯能離也　若爾何故第一．第三先說離言。	故離疑言顯能離也　若爾何故第一．第三先說離言。	If so, why do the first and third first speak of the word free?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a21_16']	第二能離後方說耶　答阿毘達磨性相而求逐便即明何責先後。	第二能離後方說耶　答阿毘達磨性相而求逐便即明何責先後。	Why is the second [ability] to be free from later explained?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a22_7']	第四亦復言無分別。	第四亦復言無分別。	The fourth also says there is no discrimination.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a22_16']	豈無分別亦是障耶。	豈無分別亦是障耶。	How can it be that being without discrimination is also an obstacle?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a23_6']	然第四釋理亦小通。	然第四釋理亦小通。	However, the fourth explanation is also slightly reasonable.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a24_1']	既非論意故亦不取　三論云。	既非論意故亦不取　三論云。	Since it is not the intention of the treatise, it is also not accepted. The three treatises say:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a25_5']	由離所聞所思法中我我所執斷法執故者　釋曰。	由離所聞所思法中我我所執斷法執故者　釋曰。	Because of abandoning the grasping of self and what belongs to self in the Dharma that is heard and contemplated, and because of abandoning the grasping of dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a26_5']	雖離諸疑然隨所聞若教義等皆執有性。	雖離諸疑然隨所聞若教義等皆執有性。	Although one is free from various doubts, one still grasps at existence in accordance with what is heard, whether it be the teachings or their meaning.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a26_14']	便障唯識法空觀智。	便障唯識法空觀智。	This then obstructs the cognition that observes the emptiness of dharmas and consciousness only.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a27_9', 'ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a28_4']	故斷法執方名真觀　四論云。🔽由於現前住安立一切相中。	故斷法執方名真觀　四論云。 由於現前住安立一切相中。	Therefore, abandoning the grasping of dharmas is called true observation. The four treatises say:🔽Because of not giving rise to thoughts and not discriminating in the present, one abandons discrimination and establishes all characteristics.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961a29_5']	無所作意無所分別斷分別故者　釋曰。	無所作意無所分別斷分別故者　釋曰。	The explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b01_5']	於此安立現前相中而無作意及離分別。	於此安立現前相中而無作意及離分別。	In this establishment and manifestation of characteristics, one does not give rise to thoughts or depart from discrimination.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b02_1']	斷分別言而通一切分別之法。	斷分別言而通一切分別之法。	The words abandoning discrimination encompass all discriminating dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b02_14']	若隨別說是忍一位能觀之智。	若隨別說是忍一位能觀之智。	If we speak in terms of the specific, it is the one stage of patience that is the wisdom that is able to contemplate.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b02_19']	此即勝障。	此即勝障。	This is the superior obstacle.🔽When one enters the first ground, it is extinguished and called eliminated.🔽Question: Why is it also necessary to eliminate the wisdom of discrimination in the stage of patience?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b04_16']	入初地時息滅名斷　問何以復須斷此忍位分別智觀　答此忍雖離能所分別。	入初地時息滅名斷　問何以復須斷此忍位分別智觀　答此忍雖離能所分別。	Answer: Although this patience is free from the discrimination of subject and object,🔽it still has the subtle discrimination that obstructs the non-discriminating wisdom of the first ground, and therefore it must be eliminated.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b06_14']	然自有彼微細分別障彼初地無分別智故須滅也　問何者為處　答處謂處所。	然自有彼微細分別障彼初地無分別智故須滅也　問何者為處　答處謂處所。	Question: What is the location? Answer: Location refers to the place.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b07_1']	即四所障。	即四所障。	It is the four that are obstructed.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b07_10']	由此四障障四觀行。	由此四障障四觀行。	Because these four obstacles obstruct the four practices of contemplation,

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0961b10_1']	障即是處持業釋也　此總意云。	障即是處持業釋也　此總意云。	The general meaning of this is as follows.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c19_19']	謂苦法智無間無漏惠生。	謂苦法智無間無漏惠生。	It is said that the uncontaminated wisdom that arises immediately after the cognition of the truth of suffering,

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c21_6']	言後諸聖法皆是此種類。	言後諸聖法皆是此種類。	It is said that all subsequent holy dharmas are of this type.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c21_11']	所以者何。	所以者何。	Why is this?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c22_5']	由初二種是後一切聖法種類。	由初二種是後一切聖法種類。	Because the first two are the type of all subsequent holy dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c22_12']	從此彼得生故。	從此彼得生故。	Because they are born from this.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c23_8']	是故無漏惠生各別內證緣此為境。	是故無漏惠生各別內證緣此為境。	Therefore, the uncontaminated wisdom that arises individually and internally realizes this as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c24_1']	言後諸聖法皆是此種類。	言後諸聖法皆是此種類。	It is said that all subsequent holy dharmas are of this type.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c24_13']	是故名為苦類智忍　釋曰。	是故名為苦類智忍　釋曰。	Therefore, it is called the receptivity to the cognition of the aspects of suffering.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c25_11']	初二忍智是後所生聖道種類名為苦類。	初二忍智是後所生聖道種類名為苦類。	The first two receptivities and cognitions are of the same type as the noble path that is subsequently produced, and are called the aspects of suffering.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0963c26_3']	智緣此忍名之為忍。	智緣此忍名之為忍。	The cognition that takes this receptivity as its object is called receptivity.

['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a02_13']	疏有兩釋。	疏有兩釋。	The commentary has two explanations.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a03_1']	有義彈初釋云。	有義彈初釋云。	There is an interpretation that refutes the first explanation, saying:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a04_1']	此論．對法皆云類忍於法忍智各別內證。	此論．對法皆云類忍於法忍智各別內證。	This treatise and the Abhidharma all say that the receptivity of the same type is individually realized by the receptivity to the dharma and the cognition of the dharma.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a04_15']	即已總法無間．解脫二自證分。	即已總法無間．解脫二自證分。	It is precisely the two parts of self-realization, the uninterrupted and the liberation, that are already generally dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a05_5']	又云類智印可類忍。	又云類智印可類忍。	It also says that the cognition of the same type approves the receptivity of the same type.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a05_14']	不說類智別證法智。	不說類智別證法智。	It does not say that the cognition of the same type separately realizes the cognition of the dharma.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a06_9']	如何乃言法真見道解脫自證。	如何乃言法真見道解脫自證。	How can it be said that the path of seeing of the truth of dharmas is the self-realization of liberation?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a06_14']	今作二釋。	今作二釋。	Now there are two explanations.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a07_16']	一云法忍法智別法真見無間．解脫見分緣如。	一云法忍法智別法真見無間．解脫見分緣如。	The first says that the forbearance and knowledge of dharmas separately see the suchness of the path of seeing of the truth of dharmas, and the seeing part of the uninterrupted and liberated [paths] takes suchness as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a08_11']	類忍總法無間．解脫自證緣智。	類忍總法無間．解脫自證緣智。	The forbearance and knowledge of the subsequent [truths] generally take the uninterrupted and liberated [paths] of the [truth of] dharmas as their object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a09_6']	然未決定類智重法審決印持。	然未決定類智重法審決印持。	However, it is not yet certain. The knowledge of the subsequent [truths] carefully examines and confirms the [truth of] dharmas again.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a09_15']	亦同類忍法二自證。	亦同類忍法二自證。	It is also the same as the two self-realizations of the forbearance and knowledge of the [truth of] dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a10_6']	二云前三如前。	二云前三如前。	The second says that the first three are as above.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a10_15']	第四既云印可類忍。	第四既云印可類忍。	The fourth says that it confirms the forbearance of the subsequent [truths].
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a11_15']	由是總法無間．解脫證自證分緣自證分。	由是總法無間．解脫證自證分緣自證分。	Therefore, it is the uninterrupted and liberated [paths] of the general [truth of] dharmas, and the part of realization of self-realization takes the part of self-realization as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a12_9']	二道之中自證緣見四緣第三。	二道之中自證緣見四緣第三。	Among the two paths, self-realization takes the seeing part as its object, and the third [part] as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a13_1']	今類智忍既法自證。	今類智忍既法自證。	Now, since the forbearance of the knowledge of the subsequent [truths] is the self-realization of the [truth of] dharmas,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a13_14']	第四緣忍明法二道證自證分。	第四緣忍明法二道證自證分。	the fourth takes the forbearance as its object, and clarifies the part of realization of self-realization of the two paths of the [truth of] dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a14_5']	但說法見及自證者。	但說法見及自證者。	It only speaks of the seeing of the [truth of] dharmas and self-realization,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a14_10']	略不論之。	略不論之。	and does not discuss it in detail.🔽The meaning must necessarily be so.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a14_18']	義必應爾　詳曰。	義必應爾　詳曰。	The detailed explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a15_11']	而言法者但法真見緣如智。	而言法者但法真見緣如智。	As for the term dharmas, it only refers to the knowledge of suchness that sees the truth of dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a16_4']	別不據法彼別別行相。	別不據法彼別別行相。	The distinction is not based on the distinct aspects of the dharma.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a16_13']	以真見中無別行故。	以真見中無別行故。	Because in true seeing there are no distinct aspects.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a17_8']	第三雖但證前二智第四亦然。	第三雖但證前二智第四亦然。	Although the third only realizes the first two knowledges, the fourth is also like this.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a17_13']	或緣第三。	或緣第三。	Or it takes the third as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a18_4']	然祇是智而緣於智。	然祇是智而緣於智。	However, it is only knowledge that takes knowledge as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a18_13']	據此一邊別配二道。	據此一邊別配二道。	Based on this one aspect, the two paths are separately assigned.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a19_8']	不約三四解行以分故亦何爽。	不約三四解行以分故亦何爽。	Since it is not based on the third and fourth to distinguish the path of practice and insight, how could it be wrong?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a20_4']	故論結云差別建立名相見道。	故論結云差別建立名相見道。	Therefore the treatise concludes by saying that the establishment of distinctions is called the path of seeing.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a20_18']	若第三．四俱雙法前二道自證。	若第三．四俱雙法前二道自證。	If the third and fourth both take the dharma as their object, the first two paths realize themselves.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a21_8']	差別之義而不顯也。	差別之義而不顯也。	The meaning of distinction is not evident.🔽If the two paths take the dharma as their object and realize the part that realizes itself, there is reason but no text. Perhaps the text is omitted.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a22_14']	若法二道證自證分有理無文　或亦無失文省略爾　疏。	若法二道證自證分有理無文　或亦無失文省略爾　疏。	The commentary says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a23_3']	又解此總法者。	又解此總法者。	Another interpretation is that this general dharma
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a23_8']	但法緣如。	但法緣如。	only takes the suchness as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a24_4']	不分二道見與自證名總法也。	不分二道見與自證名總法也。	It does not distinguish the two paths of seeing and self-realization, and is called the general dharma.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a25_1']	疏。	疏。	The commentary says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a25_15']	雖緣智緣如不同見分是一等者。	雖緣智緣如不同見分是一等者。	Although the object of knowledge and the suchness are different, the seeing part is the same.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a26_10']	謂真無間．解脫二智皆緣於如。	謂真無間．解脫二智皆緣於如。	This means that both the uninterrupted and liberated knowledges take suchness as their object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a27_5']	類忍緣智據能緣見同故合法。	類忍緣智據能緣見同故合法。	The forbearance of the class and the knowledge that takes it as its object are combined because they are the same in terms of the view that takes them as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a28_1']	論。	論。	The treatise says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a28_11']	二者依觀下上諦等者。	二者依觀下上諦等者。	Second, based on observing the lower and higher truths, etc.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a28_17']	按五十五云。	按五十五云。	According to the fifty-five, it says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964a29_6']	現觀邊智諦現觀。	現觀邊智諦現觀。	The knowledge of the truths on the edge of realization.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b01_6', 'ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b01_15']	當知此智第三心無間從見道起方現在前。🔽緣先世智曾所觀察。	當知此智第三心無間從見道起方現在前。 緣先世智曾所觀察。	It should be known that this knowledge arises in the present immediately after the third mind, and only then does it appear.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b02_10']	下上二地及二增上安立諦境。	下上二地及二增上安立諦境。	It takes as its object the two higher and lower stages and the two supreme established truths that were previously observed by the knowledge of the world.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b03_1']	似法類智世俗智攝。	似法類智世俗智攝。	It is subsumed by knowledge similar to knowledge of dharmas and kinds and conventional knowledge.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b03_7']	通世．出世。	通世．出世。	It is both worldly and supramundane.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b03_16']	是出世間智後所得。	是出世間智後所得。	It is attained after supramundane knowledge.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b04_9']	如其次第於一一諦二種智生。	如其次第於一一諦二種智生。	In accordance with the sequence, two kinds of knowledge arise for each truth.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b04_16']	謂忍可欲樂智。	謂忍可欲樂智。	Namely, the knowledge of what is possible and desirable,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b07_1']	及現觀決定智如是從前現觀起已於下上諸諦中二二智生　釋曰緣先世者略有二解。	及現觀決定智如是從前現觀起已於下上諸諦中二二智生　釋曰緣先世者略有二解。	and the knowledge of the certainty of realization. In this way, after arising from the previous realization, two kinds of knowledge arise for each of the lower and higher truths. The commentary says previously observed has two explanations.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b08_13']	一云緣見道前曾所觀察下欲界地上色．無色二地煩惱即苦．集諦。	一云緣見道前曾所觀察下欲界地上色．無色二地煩惱即苦．集諦。	One says that it takes as its object the afflictions of the two stages below the path of seeing, namely the desire realm and the two stages of form and formless realms, which are the truths of suffering and accumulation,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b09_6']	及二增上即滅．道二安立諦境。	及二增上即滅．道二安立諦境。	and the two superior [truths] which are the truths of cessation and path.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b09_17']	二云緣前真見名曾觀察。	二云緣前真見名曾觀察。	The second says that it takes as its object the previously realized true seeing.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b11_7']	以放真見緣下上地及二地中所有增上安立四諦以之為境。	以放真見緣下上地及二地中所有增上安立四諦以之為境。	It takes as its object the superior [truths] of the two stages below and above, and the four truths of superior establishment in the two stages, and takes them as its object.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b11_14']	言第三無間者。	言第三無間者。	It is said to be the third uninterrupted [path].
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b12_14']	三心見道第三心後而起十六名第三無間。	三心見道第三心後而起十六名第三無間。	After the third thought of the path of seeing, it gives rise to the sixteen [moments of] thought, which are called the third uninterrupted [path].
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b13_1']	餘文可悉。	餘文可悉。	The rest of the text can be understood.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b13_10']	又按顯揚第十七云。	又按顯揚第十七云。	Moreover, according to the seventeenth chapter of the Abhidharmasamuccaya,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b13_18']	從此諦現觀已上。	從此諦現觀已上。	after the realization of the truth,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b14_15']	於修道中有十六行世出世清淨智生。	於修道中有十六行世出世清淨智生。	in the path of cultivation, there arises the pure knowledge of the world and the supramundane, which consists of sixteen aspects.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b15_8']	謂於欲繫苦諦生二智。	謂於欲繫苦諦生二智。	That is to say, with regard to the truth of suffering that is bound to the desire realm, two kinds of knowledge arise.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b15_15']	一現觀審察智。	一現觀審察智。	The first is the knowledge of thorough investigation in realization.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b16_4']	二現觀決定智。	二現觀決定智。	The second is the knowledge of definite determination in realization.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b17_1']	於色．無色繫苦諦亦有如是二智。	於色．無色繫苦諦亦有如是二智。	With regard to the truth of suffering that is bound to the form and formless realms, there are also these two kinds of knowledge.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b17_9']	如於苦諦有四智。	如於苦諦有四智。	Just as there are four knowledges regarding the truth of suffering,
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b18_7']	如是於集．滅．道亦各有四智　釋曰。	如是於集．滅．道亦各有四智　釋曰。	in the same way there are also four knowledges regarding the truths of origination, cessation, and path.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b18_16']	四諦二智同五十五。	四諦二智同五十五。	The two knowledges regarding the four truths are the same as the fifty-five.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b19_7']	見．修位別如燈已會。	見．修位別如燈已會。	The difference between the stages of seeing and cultivation is as explained by the lamp.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b20_1']	論。	論。	The treatise says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b20_12']	諸相見道至真已斷故者。	諸相見道至真已斷故者。	The path of seeing of characteristics truly eliminates them.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b20_17']	此會違文。	此會違文。	This resolves the contradiction in the texts.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b21_2']	五十五云。	五十五云。	The fifty-five says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b22_4']	世第一無間有三心生斷見所斷　顯揚十七云。	世第一無間有三心生斷見所斷　顯揚十七云。	Immediately after the supreme worldly state, three minds arise, eliminating what is eliminated by seeing. The seventeenth of the Manifestations says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b22_15']	從第一法無間有三心生。	從第一法無間有三心生。	Immediately after the supreme worldly state, three minds arise.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b23_13']	斷見所斷百一十二煩惱　對法論云。	斷見所斷百一十二煩惱　對法論云。	Eliminating the one hundred and twelve afflictions that are eliminated by seeing. The Treatise on the Compendium of the Great Vehicle says:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b24_9']	謂世第一法無間苦法智忍等生。	謂世第一法無間苦法智忍等生。	That is to say, immediately after the supreme worldly state, the receptivity to the knowledge of the factors of the path of suffering and so forth arise.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b25_6']	由此惠故永捨見苦所斷一切煩惱。	由此惠故永捨見苦所斷一切煩惱。	By means of this wisdom, one permanently abandons all the afflictions that are eliminated by seeing the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b26_1']	如是文等並皆依真而假說也。	如是文等並皆依真而假說也。	These texts and so forth all provisionally speak based on reality.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b26_6']	對法會云。	對法會云。	The Treatise on the Compendium of the Great Vehicle resolves this by saying:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b27_4']	又如上說見道差別皆假建立非真實爾。	又如上說見道差別皆假建立非真實爾。	Moreover, as explained above, the distinctions in the path of seeing are all provisionally established, not truly so.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b27_8']	何以故。	何以故。	Why is this?
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b28_2']	出世住中各別內證離戲論故。	出世住中各別內證離戲論故。	Because they are each individually realized and free from conceptual proliferation within the stage of transcendent abiding.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b29_1']	疏。	疏。	The commentary states:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964b29_11']	非安立因不遍三心者。	非安立因不遍三心者。	The reason of non-establishment does not pervade the three minds.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964c01_1']	三心相見非安立故。	三心相見非安立故。	Because the three minds of appearance and insight are not established.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964c02_1']	故不得以非安立因以證三心非真見道。	故不得以非安立因以證三心非真見道。	Therefore, one cannot use the reason of non-establishment to prove that the three minds are not the true path of insight.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964c03_1']	疏。	疏。	The commentary states:
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964c03_11']	佛地論至二師之義者。	佛地論至二師之義者。	The Buddha Land Treatise is the meaning of the two masters.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964c04_9']	彼第一師同此第二彼後二師同此第三。	彼第一師同此第二彼後二師同此第三。	The first master of that treatise is the same as the second here. The last two masters of that treatise are the same as the third here.
['ZH_T43_1833_07a:0964c05_5']	彼第二師總言無漏智有見．相。	彼第二師總言無漏智有見．相。	The second master of that treatise says in general that the pure wisdom has insight and appearance.
