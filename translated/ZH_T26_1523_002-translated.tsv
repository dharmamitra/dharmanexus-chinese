['ZH_T26_1523_002:0213a03_14']	智隨順識故，彼性是故不滅，作真實境界相故，成捨自相義，是故智無自相境界，或識是真實相境界。	智隨順識故，彼性是故不滅，作真實境界相故，成捨自相義，是故智無自相境界，或識是真實相境界。	Because cognition follows cognition, that nature is therefore not extinguished. Because it makes the characteristics of the true realm, it establishes the meaning of abandoning its own characteristics. Therefore, cognition does not have the realm of its own characteristics, or cognition is the realm of the true characteristics.
