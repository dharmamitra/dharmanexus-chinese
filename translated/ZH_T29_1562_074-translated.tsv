['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745b17_3']	若法先時曾得棄捨，今雖還得而非所修，非設劬勞而證得故。	若法先時曾得棄捨，今雖還得而非所修，非設劬勞而證得故。	If a dharma was previously attained but then abandoned, even if it is now attained again, it is not what is cultivated, because it is not attained through exertion.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745b18_11']	若於先時未得而起，極用功起勢力勝故，此方能修未來功德。	若於先時未得而起，極用功起勢力勝故，此方能修未來功德。	If one generates it when one has not previously obtained it, it is generated by the power of intense effort, and therefore it is able to cultivate future merits.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745b20_10']	若先已得今起現前，彼不能修未來功德，非多功起勢力劣故，修用止息故不能修未來。	若先已得今起現前，彼不能修未來功德，非多功起勢力劣故，修用止息故不能修未來。	If one has previously obtained it and now generates it in the present, one is not able to cultivate future merits, because it is not generated by the power of intense effort, and because the function of cultivation is suspended and one is therefore unable to cultivate future merits.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745b23_1']	若曾得現前能修未來者，則薄伽梵得盡智時，應未具修一切功德，為具證得應更進修，便同二乘功德不滿。	若曾得現前能修未來者，則薄伽梵得盡智時，應未具修一切功德，為具證得應更進修，便同二乘功德不滿。	If one who has previously obtained it in the present is able to cultivate future merits, then when the Bhagavat obtained the knowledge of the extinction of contamination, he should not yet have cultivated all merits, and in order to perfect his realization and obtainment, he should have further cultivated them, and he would be the same as the two vehicles in not having perfected his merits.

['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745b28_2', 'ZH_T29_1562_074:0745b29_10']	論曰：🔽諸未曾得功德現前，及得未來所餘功德，新修得故皆名得修。	論曰： 諸未曾得功德現前，及得未來所餘功德，新修得故皆名得修。	The treatise says:🔽The manifestation of merits that have never been obtained before, and the future obtaining of the remaining merits, are all called the cultivation of attainment because they are newly cultivated and obtained.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c01_8']	曾得未曾功德現起，現修習故皆名習修。	曾得未曾功德現起，現修習故皆名習修。	The manifestation of merits that have been obtained before, and the present cultivation and practice, are all called the cultivation of practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c01_17']	此二但依善有為立。	此二但依善有為立。	These two are established only based on conditioned good dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c02_16']	未來唯得現具二修，於身等法得能治故。	未來唯得現具二修，於身等法得能治故。	Only the future [dharmas] have the cultivation of attainment, while the present [dharmas] have both [attainment and practice]. Because one obtains the ability to counteract the body, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c04_14']	所治身等名對治修，故於身等得對治時，即說名為修於身等，餘有漏法類亦應然。	所治身等名對治修，故於身等得對治時，即說名為修於身等，餘有漏法類亦應然。	The body, etc. that are to be countered are called the cultivation of antidotes. Therefore, when one obtains the antidotes to the body, etc., it is said that one cultivates the body, etc. The same should be the case for the remaining contaminated dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c05_13']	緣身等境煩惱斷故，說身等法名除遣修。	緣身等境煩惱斷故，說身等法名除遣修。	Because the afflictions that take the body, etc. as objects are eliminated, the body, etc. are called the cultivation of elimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c07_2']	故緣身等煩惱斷時，亦說名為修於身等，餘有漏法例亦應然。	故緣身等煩惱斷時，亦說名為修於身等，餘有漏法例亦應然。	Therefore, when the afflictions that take the body, etc. as objects are eliminated, it is also said that one cultivates the body, etc. The same should be the case for the remaining contaminated dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c08_1']	此二但依有漏法立，故有漏善具足四修。	此二但依有漏法立，故有漏善具足四修。	These two are established only based on contaminated dharmas. Therefore, contaminated good [dharmas] are fully endowed with the four cultivations.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c08_19']	無漏有為餘有漏法，如次各具前後二修。	無漏有為餘有漏法，如次各具前後二修。	Uncontaminated conditioned dharmas and the remaining contaminated dharmas each possess the latter two types of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c11_7']	有於此中約當修義，分別諸法具修多少，有法具四名為當修，有法具三、有法具二、有法具一、有法全無。	有於此中約當修義，分別諸法具修多少，有法具四名為當修，有法具三、有法具二、有法具一、有法全無。	Here, based on the meaning of future cultivation, the dharmas are distinguished as possessing more or less cultivation. There are dharmas that possess four, which are called future cultivation. There are dharmas that possess three, two, one, or none at all.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c13_15']	謂善有漏未永斷時，可得可生具足四種，此未永斷故當具治遣修，以可得故當具得修，是可生故當具習修。	謂善有漏未永斷時，可得可生具足四種，此未永斷故當具治遣修，以可得故當具得修，是可生故當具習修。	That is to say, when wholesome contaminated dharmas have not yet been permanently eliminated, they can be obtained and produced, and are fully endowed with four types. Because they have not yet been permanently eliminated, they will in the future possess the cultivation of elimination. Because they can be obtained, they will in the future possess the cultivation of obtaining. Because they can be produced, they will in the future possess the cultivation of practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c15_13']	已得可生具三除得，可得不生具三除習，已得不生及不可得已生具二，謂治遣修。	已得可生具三除得，可得不生具三除習，已得不生及不可得已生具二，謂治遣修。	Those that have been obtained but cannot be produced possess three, excluding obtaining. Those that can be obtained but cannot be produced possess three, excluding practice. Those that have been obtained and cannot be produced, as well as those that cannot be obtained and have already been produced, possess two, namely the cultivation of elimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c16_3']	染及無記未斷亦爾。	染及無記未斷亦爾。	Contaminated and indeterminate dharmas that have not yet been eliminated are also like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c18_10']	若善有漏已永斷時，可得可生具得習二，可得不生具一謂得，已得可生具一謂習，有為無漏應知亦爾。	若善有漏已永斷時，可得可生具得習二，可得不生具一謂得，已得可生具一謂習，有為無漏應知亦爾。	If one obtains and produces good impure dharmas after they have been eternally eliminated, one obtains both the possession of the present and the possession of the future. If one obtains but does not produce them, one obtains only the possession of the present. If one already possesses those that can be produced, one obtains only the possession of the future. Understand that conditioned pure dharmas are also like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c19_10']	除前所說皆是全無，謂無漏法中已得不生等。	除前所說皆是全無，謂無漏法中已得不生等。	All the rest are completely nonexistent, i.e., pure dharmas that have been obtained but that cannot be produced, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c21_4']	若不生法不住身中，但由得故即名修者，應許擇滅亦名為修，無差別故。	若不生法不住身中，但由得故即名修者，應許擇滅亦名為修，無差別故。	If dharmas that cannot be produced do not reside in the body, but one is said to cultivate them merely by obtaining them, then one should also say that one cultivates cessation resulting from discrimination, because there is no difference between the two.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c21_18']	此難非理，彼同類法住身中故。	此難非理，彼同類法住身中故。	This objection is unreasonable, because those of the same species reside in the body.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c22_17']	謂不生法雖不住身，同類住身，名修無失。	謂不生法雖不住身，同類住身，名修無失。	That is, even though dharmas that cannot be produced do not reside in the body, those of the same species that do reside in the body are called cultivated without error.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c25_4']	又彼由得為果住故，謂未來世不生善法，由令得生表為果住，義言我等闕緣不生，非謂今時不蒙招引；	又彼由得為果住故，謂未來世不生善法，由令得生表為果住，義言我等闕緣不生，非謂今時不蒙招引；	Also, because those dharmas that can be produced reside in the future as a result of possession. That is, good dharmas that can be produced in the future are caused to be produced by possession, which is said to reside as a result. We say that we lack conditions and therefore are not produced, but we do not say that at the present time we are not attracted and led by possession.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c25_14']	擇滅異此，不可為例。	擇滅異此，不可為例。	Cessation resulting from discrimination is different from this and cannot be used as an analogy.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c26_12']	又未來世不生善法，亦有因力攝益現身；	又未來世不生善法，亦有因力攝益現身；	Moreover, in the future, wholesome dharmas that are not yet born also have the power of causes to benefit the present body;
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c27_2']	擇滅不然，故無修義。	擇滅不然，故無修義。	cessation through discrimination is not like this, so there is no meaning of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0745c28_10']	又由擇滅唯是果故，謂修本為獲得勝果，滅非有果故不應修。	又由擇滅唯是果故，謂修本為獲得勝果，滅非有果故不應修。	Moreover, because cessation through discrimination is only a result, that is to say, cultivation is originally for the sake of attaining superior results. Cessation is not a result, so it should not be cultivated.
['ZH_T29_1562_074:0746a01_7']	又由擇滅無增減故，謂可修法依下至中依中至上，擇滅不爾，於修無用故不可修。	又由擇滅無增減故，謂可修法依下至中依中至上，擇滅不爾，於修無用故不可修。	Moreover, because cessation through discrimination has no increase or decrease, that is to say, cultivable dharmas rely on the lower to reach the middle and rely on the middle to reach the upper. Cessation through discrimination is not like this. It has no use in cultivation, so it cannot be cultivated.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
