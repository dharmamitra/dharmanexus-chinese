['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019a23_10']	夫欲儲淨法，先滌身器；	夫欲儲淨法，先滌身器；	If one wishes to store pure Dharma, one must first purify the body and mind;

['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019a25_18']	所以復指名區、更申玄集，切身口而流訓，則一言一行斯佛事矣；	所以復指名區、更申玄集，切身口而流訓，則一言一行斯佛事矣；	Therefore, it is necessary to point out the realm of names and further explain the profound collection. When it flows the teachings by cutting off body and speech, then every word and action is the Buddha's work;
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019a26_16']	因動靜以研機，則舉足下足斯道場矣。	因動靜以研機，則舉足下足斯道場矣。	Following movement and stillness to investigate the potential, then every step is a place of practice.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019a29_12']	誠嶮道之夷蹬，闇室之凝釭，度疫之仙丸，出苦之神馭，鑒德者之明鏡，嚴心者之寶鬘，涉象季之大師，處塵俗之善友。	誠嶮道之夷蹬，闇室之凝釭，度疫之仙丸，出苦之神馭，鑒德者之明鏡，嚴心者之寶鬘，涉象季之大師，處塵俗之善友。	It is truly a flat step on a dangerous path, a bright lamp in a dark room, a divine pill for crossing epidemics, a divine vehicle for leaving suffering, a bright mirror for those who examine virtue, a precious garland for those who adorn the mind, a great teacher for those who enter the image age, a good friend for those who dwell in the dust and world.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b01_17']	雖目之無眹、摶之不觸，而芬郁布寫，類迷迭之盈空；	雖目之無眹、摶之不觸，而芬郁布寫，類迷迭之盈空；	Although it has no trace when seen, and cannot be touched when grasped, its fragrance spreads everywhere, like frankincense filling the sky;
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b02_9']	潔映澄華，比醍醐之洞色。	潔映澄華，比醍醐之洞色。	Its purity and radiance are comparable to the penetrating color of ghee.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b04_7']	含靈所以埏埴，法界所以彌綸，善逝法王抗之以為明足，具壽尊者養之而為淨命。	含靈所以埏埴，法界所以彌綸，善逝法王抗之以為明足，具壽尊者養之而為淨命。	It is the clay for shaping sentient beings, and the all-encompassing for the Dharma realm. The Well-Gone Dharma King holds it as his illuminating foot, and the Venerable One of Full Life nourishes it as his pure livelihood.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b05_1']	但簡以行處，或非處而難遵；	但簡以行處，或非處而難遵；	But it is difficult to follow if it is in a place that is not suitable for practice;

['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b06_16']	十七群之喧浴尚動王譏，五百生之掉影仍貽佛誡。	十七群之喧浴尚動王譏，五百生之掉影仍貽佛誡。	The clamorous bathing of the group of seventeen still moved the king to criticize, and the shaking shadow of the five hundred lives still received the Buddha's admonition.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b08_6']	矧復齅蓮馥而為盜，分釧響以成婬，涅槃為求，保專精而尚犯；	矧復齅蓮馥而為盜，分釧響以成婬，涅槃為求，保專精而尚犯；	Moreover, smelling the fragrance of the lotus and stealing it, dividing the sound of the anklet and committing lust, seeking nirvana, being diligent and still committing offenses;
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b08_18']	菩提入願，受欲樂而猶持。	菩提入願，受欲樂而猶持。	Entering the vow of bodhi, receiving desires and pleasures and still upholding it.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b10_4']	輕嫌與重性同科，意防與身遮共品，諦故住故，能行所行。	輕嫌與重性同科，意防與身遮共品，諦故住故，能行所行。	Light shame and heavy nature are categorized together, mental prevention and bodily obstruction are grouped together. Because of truth and abiding, one is able to practice and the other is practiced.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b13_12']	導以隨喜，融以法性，豈止草繫情殷、木叉義遠，毒龍卷毒、怖鴿忘怖，將被之黎蠢、棲之常樂，使八寒流煦、五熱浮涼，薜荔失其炎河、輪圍發其闇渚。	導以隨喜，融以法性，豈止草繫情殷、木叉義遠，毒龍卷毒、怖鴿忘怖，將被之黎蠢、棲之常樂，使八寒流煦、五熱浮涼，薜荔失其炎河、輪圍發其闇渚。	Guiding with joy, melting with the nature of dharmas, how could it be limited to the deep feelings of the grass-bound, or the distant meaning of the wooden-wheel? The poisonous dragon rolls back its poison, the frightened dove forgets its fear, it will cover the ignorant masses and settle them in constant bliss, causing the eight cold hells to flow with warmth and the five hot hells to float with coolness, the hungry ghosts to lose their flaming river, and the iron enclosure to emit a dark island.
['ZH_T07_0220k_001:1019b14_3']	行門允備，種智克圓。	行門允備，種智克圓。	The practices are fully complete, and the wisdom of the five parts is perfected.
