['ZH_T38_1778_010:0695c25_12']	理中無上戒定慧香，芬芳叵竭，故名為香。	理中無上戒定慧香，芬芳叵竭，故名為香。	In the principle, there is the unsurpassed fragrance of precepts, concentration, and wisdom, which is fragrant and inexhaustible, thus it is called fragrance.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0695c26_7']	積是聚集為義，積諸功德集成法身。	積是聚集為義，積諸功德集成法身。	Accumulation means the meaning of gathering, accumulating various merits to form the Dharma body.

['ZH_T38_1778_010:0695c28_14']	今依正報勝人以標名，故稱香積品。	今依正報勝人以標名，故稱香積品。	Now, it is named after the superior person who is the correct embodiment, thus it is called the Chapter on Fragrant Accumulation.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a02_6']	此品來意，正為室內明非真非有之中，能道觀雙流、淨穢俱顯，圓通不礙、融會無方，入不二門雙亡二邊正入中道。	此品來意，正為室內明非真非有之中，能道觀雙流、淨穢俱顯，圓通不礙、融會無方，入不二門雙亡二邊正入中道。	The intention of this chapter is precisely to clarify that within the non-true and non-existent of the inner chamber, the two contemplations of the Way and the observation of phenomena flow together, purity and defilement are both revealed, unobstructed and perfectly interfused, entering the non-dual gate and simultaneously forgetting the two extremes, correctly entering the Middle Way.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a04_6']	此品雙照二諦，淨穢俱融，廣上非真非假之文，成於道觀雙流之義，顯出圓通自在之用。	此品雙照二諦，淨穢俱融，廣上非真非假之文，成於道觀雙流之義，顯出圓通自在之用。	This chapter illuminates the two truths simultaneously, and purity and defilement are both perfectly interfused, elaborating on the text of non-true and non-false, forming the meaning of the two contemplations of the Way and the observation of phenomena flowing together, revealing the function of perfect interfusion and freedom.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a07_4']	今文異上雙照二諦之用，上〈問疾品〉未廣明雙用結成菩薩行具舉諸行，雖知諸佛國土永寂如空，而現種種清淨佛土，是菩薩行。	今文異上雙照二諦之用，上〈問疾品〉未廣明雙用結成菩薩行具舉諸行，雖知諸佛國土永寂如空，而現種種清淨佛土，是菩薩行。	The meaning of this text is different from the above function of illuminating the two truths simultaneously. In the chapter on inquiring about illness, the two functions were not yet extensively clarified, and the formation of the bodhisattva's practice was mentioned by citing various practices. Although it is known that the lands of the buddhas are eternally quiescent like empty space, various pure buddha lands are manifested, which is the bodhisattva's practice.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a08_1']	今文還釋上二用，明淨穢二土相涉。	今文還釋上二用，明淨穢二土相涉。	This text now explains the above two functions, clarifying the mutual involvement of the two lands of purity and defilement.

Therefore, it is known that from beginning to end, this sutra completely explains the causes and effects of the Buddha's lands, and its meaning is evident.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a10_18']	此文明淨穢二土之行既爾，諸行亦然，舉此以例諸也。	此文明淨穢二土之行既爾，諸行亦然，舉此以例諸也。	This passage clarifies the practices of the pure and defiled lands. Since it is so, all practices are also like this. It raises this to exemplify all.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a11_5']	故有此品文來。	故有此品文來。	Therefore, this chapter's text comes.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a11_13']	就此品大為二意：	就此品大為二意：	In this chapter, there are two main points:
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a12_9']	一明身子念食、二明大士譏訶。	一明身子念食、二明大士譏訶。	First, explaining Śāriputra's thought of food; second, explaining the great being's criticism.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a13_5']	身子是起教之人，為兩事故須念食：	身子是起教之人，為兩事故須念食：	Śāriputra is the one who initiates the teaching. For two reasons, he must think of food:
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a14_11']	一者諸佛道法過中不飡，此諸大人食時將到，故須起念。	一者諸佛道法過中不飡，此諸大人食時將到，故須起念。	First, the Buddha's way is to not eat after noon. Since the time for these great beings to eat is approaching, he must think of it.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a16_9']	二者上文云「應以何法起菩薩根」，上來室內敷說勝法，音聲佛事即是音聲起菩薩根。	二者上文云「應以何法起菩薩根」，上來室內敷說勝法，音聲佛事即是音聲起菩薩根。	Second, the above text says, What Dharma should be used to give rise to the bodhisattva's faculties? The superior Dharma explained in the room above is the Buddha's work of sound, which is the sound that gives rise to the bodhisattva's faculties.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a18_19']	次應用香味二法起菩薩根，時眾將用鼻舌兩根聞於大乘禪悅法喜，機在不久，故身子扣此機端而致念也。	次應用香味二法起菩薩根，時眾將用鼻舌兩根聞於大乘禪悅法喜，機在不久，故身子扣此機端而致念也。	Next, the two dharmas of smell and taste should be used to give rise to the bodhisattva's faculties. The assembly will soon use the two faculties of nose and tongue to hear the great vehicle's meditation joy and Dharma joy. Since the opportunity is not far off, Śāriputra taps into this opportunity and thinks of it.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a20_11']	大士訶者，明其二乘八解久有禪悅，不以自資而外念求食，是故譏之。	大士訶者，明其二乘八解久有禪悅，不以自資而外念求食，是故譏之。	The great being's reprimand clarifies that the two vehicles have long had the joy of meditation in the eight liberations, but do not use it to sustain themselves and instead think of seeking food externally, thus he reproaches them.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a20_17']	第二、譏訶。	第二、譏訶。	Second, the reprimand.

['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a22_10']	一訶如文。	一訶如文。	The reprimand is as stated in the text.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a23_5']	二許食中云「且待」者，機時未至故。	二許食中云「且待」者，機時未至故。	In the permission to eat, it says wait for a while because the time for the teaching has not yet arrived.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a24_6']	「未曾有」者，明身子八解之中無此法喜禪悅也。	「未曾有」者，明身子八解之中無此法喜禪悅也。	Never before seen clarifies that among Śāriputra's eight liberations there is no such Dharma joy and meditation joy.

['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a26_20']	一入三昧、二現請飯之國、三大眾皆見。	一入三昧、二現請飯之國、三大眾皆見。	First, entering samādhi; second, manifesting the land where the invitation to eat is; third, the great assembly all sees.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696a29_3']	今言彼國以香為佛事，用香詮理，鼻根受道，無有聲聞，純諸菩薩者，此語似如實報之國蓮華藏土。	今言彼國以香為佛事，用香詮理，鼻根受道，無有聲聞，純諸菩薩者，此語似如實報之國蓮華藏土。	Now, it is said that in that country, fragrance is used as the Buddha's work. Fragrance is used to explain the principle, and the nose faculty receives the Way. There are no śrāvakas, only bodhisattvas. This statement seems to be a country of true recompense, the Land of Lotus Treasury.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696b01_15']	然同居之土亦有穢淨，亦有一乘之化無三差別者，未知彼土定判屬何。	然同居之土亦有穢淨，亦有一乘之化無三差別者，未知彼土定判屬何。	However, the defiled and pure lands of the same shared realm also have the teaching of the One Vehicle without the three distinctions. It is unknown to which category that land definitely belongs.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696b03_1']	文云「天子皆號香嚴」，既有天子勝人之名，復似隨緣淨土。	文云「天子皆號香嚴」，既有天子勝人之名，復似隨緣淨土。	The text says, The celestial sons are all called Fragrant Adornments. Since there is the name of the superior person of celestial sons, it also resembles the pure lands that follow conditions.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696b05_2']	但天語是通，何必如此間之天人，或可用菩薩為第一義天人，以權者名菩薩、實者是天人。	但天語是通，何必如此間之天人，或可用菩薩為第一義天人，以權者名菩薩、實者是天人。	However, the word celestial is general. How can it necessarily be the celestial beings of this world? It can be used to refer to bodhisattvas as the celestial beings of the highest truth. Those who use skillful means are called bodhisattvas, while those who are real are the celestial beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696b05_13']	或應如此，然未敢定判。	或應如此，然未敢定判。	Perhaps it should be like this, but I dare not make a definite judgment.

['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696b12_11']	若有得不思議解脫，致飯不難。	若有得不思議解脫，致飯不難。	If one attains the inconceivable liberation, it is not difficult to invite for alms.
['ZH_T38_1778_010:0696b13_4']	其未得亦有得義，故不可輕。	其未得亦有得義，故不可輕。	Even those who have not yet attained have the meaning of attainment, so one should not look down on them.

If one is able to give rise to the mind of the Great Vehicle, it is called the digestion of the rice, which is abiding in the position of skillful means.

This is the meaning in the Buddha's statement to Śāriputra, Do you see the great being's mastery of spiritual powers? This confirms what was said in the room, and also resolves any remaining doubts.

First, according to the sentient beings to be transformed, one takes the Buddha land. Second, one takes the land by subduing sentient beings. Third, according to the Dharma by which one enters the Buddha's wisdom, one takes the land. Fourth, one takes the land by which Dharma one arouses the faculties.

Within the faculties and objects, one can mutually use them to penetrate all dharmas. For example, the eye sees the form of paper and ink, and this form can expound all dharmas.

['ZH_T38_1778_010:0699c20_16']	如此間以聲為佛事，亦放光明亦香雲香蓋衣服等以為佛事，但從勝者為正，其餘是傍，故的判聲為佛事。	如此間以聲為佛事，亦放光明亦香雲香蓋衣服等以為佛事，但從勝者為正，其餘是傍，故的判聲為佛事。	Here, using sound as the Buddha's activity, one also emits light, and also uses fragrant clouds, fragrant canopies, clothing, etc. as the Buddha's activity. But it is the superior one that is the main focus, while the others are secondary, so sound is specifically determined to be the Buddha's activity.

In this way, when expounding the Prajnaparamita, sometimes the majestic and lofty body is manifested, or the ordinary body is manifested to resolve doubts.

It is only that the response bodies manifest long and short forms according to conditions, and there are differences in superiority and inferiority.
