Moreover, the two flavors are the cause for seeing the cream of the Dharma, and attaining the prediction and abandoning birth will certainly attract the fruition.

Moreover, the two delusions have different essences, and the coarse and fine are completely different. The two truths are originally separated, so why must they be the same?
