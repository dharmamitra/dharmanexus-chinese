['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c11_4']	紫沙門臣施護等奉　詔譯復次此中次第應修彼諸禪定，謂若得離欲愛所有喜樂，內心清淨住正相應，有尋有伺是初禪定。	紫沙門臣施護等奉　詔譯復次此中次第應修彼諸禪定，謂若得離欲愛所有喜樂，內心清淨住正相應，有尋有伺是初禪定。	Tripiṭaka Dharma Master from the Western Regions, bestowed with the purple robe, Śramaṇa official Śikṣānanda and others respectfully translated by imperial decree Next, the various meditative absorptions should be cultivated in sequence here, namely, if one attains the joy and pleasure of being free from desire and love, abides in inner mental purity and proper concordance, with applied thought and sustained thought, this is the first meditative absorption.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c11_18']	又復此中無尋唯伺，名中間禪。	又復此中無尋唯伺，名中間禪。	Moreover, here, without applied thought but with sustained thought, it is called intermediate meditation.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c13_7']	初禪地愛若得離已，所有喜樂內心清淨住正相應，是二禪定。	初禪地愛若得離已，所有喜樂內心清淨住正相應，是二禪定。	If one attains freedom from love for the stage of the first meditative absorption, the joy and pleasure of inner mental purity and abiding in proper concordance, this is the second meditative absorption.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c14_11']	二禪地愛若得離已，樂捨正知住正相應，是三禪定。	二禪地愛若得離已，樂捨正知住正相應，是三禪定。	If one attains freedom from love for the stage of the second meditative absorption, abiding in pleasure, equanimity, right knowledge, and proper concordance, this is the third meditative absorption.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c15_11']	三禪地愛若得離已，捨念相應，是四禪定。	三禪地愛若得離已，捨念相應，是四禪定。	If one attains freedom from love for the stage of the third meditative absorption, abiding in equanimity and mindfulness, this is the fourth meditative absorption.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c16_2']	所有無色定等行相應知。	所有無色定等行相應知。	The formless meditative absorptions and so forth should be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c18_11']	是中諸所緣相如應分別，於所緣中令心堅固，如理所作以慧觀察，智光明生破無明種，畢竟得斷即正相應；	是中諸所緣相如應分別，於所緣中令心堅固，如理所作以慧觀察，智光明生破無明種，畢竟得斷即正相應；	The characteristics of all objects of cognition should be distinguished as appropriate. Within the objects of cognition, one causes the mind to be firm and solid, and with wisdom one observes as is proper. The light of wisdom arises and destroys the seeds of ignorance. Ultimately attaining cessation is precisely right accord.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c19_13']	異此皆是外道所修，非正三摩地，不能斷煩惱。	異此皆是外道所修，非正三摩地，不能斷煩惱。	Different from this, all are cultivated by non-Buddhists, not the correct samādhi, and cannot eliminate afflictions.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c21_7']	如諸經說，所有正修三摩地時，若我想生，是即還復發起煩惱。	如諸經說，所有正修三摩地時，若我想生，是即還復發起煩惱。	As the sūtras say, when correctly cultivating samādhi, if the thought of self arises, then one again gives rise to afflictions.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c22_6']	爾時住心當如止水，入三摩地相應觀行。	爾時住心當如止水，入三摩地相應觀行。	At that time, abiding in the mind should be like still water, entering samādhi and corresponding to the practice of observation.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c24_4']	如《楞伽經》說，總略而言，正慧觀行唯心靜住，外無分別。	如《楞伽經》說，總略而言，正慧觀行唯心靜住，外無分別。	As the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra says, to put it briefly, the practice of correct wisdom is only the still abiding of the mind, without external discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c24_16']	若住真如所緣，是心應過。	若住真如所緣，是心應過。	If abiding in the object of cognition of suchness, this mind should transcend.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c25_10']	心若過已，彼無對礙而亦應過。	心若過已，彼無對礙而亦應過。	If the mind has transcended, then it should transcend without obstruction.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c27_4']	無對礙中若相應住是大乘觀，彼無發悟最勝寂靜，即勝無我智無對礙觀。	無對礙中若相應住是大乘觀，彼無發悟最勝寂靜，即勝無我智無對礙觀。	If one abides in accord with the unobstructed, this is the contemplation of the Great Vehicle. In that, there is no enlightenment, only supreme quiescence, which is the unobstructed contemplation of the wisdom of supreme non-self.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c29_7']	此中意者，如實觀察心外必無色法分別，是即最上相應勝行。	此中意者，如實觀察心外必無色法分別，是即最上相應勝行。	The meaning here is that one truly observes that apart from the mind there are definitely no separate dharmas of form. This is the supreme practice of accord.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0567c29_19']	若爾，識之與色云何有異？	若爾，識之與色云何有異？	If so, how are consciousness and form different?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a01_13']	或不異者，識亦應有對礙義耶？	或不異者，識亦應有對礙義耶？	Or if they are not different, should consciousness also have the meaning of obstruction?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a03_4']	不然，如夢分位所見不實，是故識外如實伺察，極微量色取不可得。	不然，如夢分位所見不實，是故識外如實伺察，極微量色取不可得。	No, like what is seen in the unrealized state of dreams. Therefore, apart from consciousness one truly investigates, and form of the smallest particle cannot be apprehended.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a04_14']	以不可得故，如是成唯識，無復一切外義可有，唯心靜住外無分別。	以不可得故，如是成唯識，無復一切外義可有，唯心靜住外無分別。	Because it cannot be apprehended, thus one accomplishes consciousness-only, and there are no more external objects that can exist. Only the mind abides in quiescence, without external discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a06_12']	於伺察中以離色法故，有所得相而為得者，畢竟無所得，是故於諸色法應觀無色。	於伺察中以離色法故，有所得相而為得者，畢竟無所得，是故於諸色法應觀無色。	In investigation, because one is apart from dharmas of form, there are characteristics that can be apprehended, but for the one who attains them, there is ultimately nothing that can be attained. Therefore, one should contemplate form as formless.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a07_15']	彼若唯心，無實能取亦無所取，是二取性實不可得。	彼若唯心，無實能取亦無所取，是二取性實不可得。	If it is only mind, there is no real grasper and also no grasped, and the nature of these two graspings is truly unobtainable.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a08_14']	離取捨故即心無二，如是伺察亦無二相。	離取捨故即心無二，如是伺察亦無二相。	Because of being free from grasping and abandoning, the mind is nondual. In this way, even the two characteristics of investigation do not exist.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a10_12']	於真如所緣中是心亦過，彼所取相亦復過已，二無對礙，於是無二智中住如實義。	於真如所緣中是心亦過，彼所取相亦復過已，二無對礙，於是無二智中住如實義。	Within the object of true suchness, this mind also transcends, and the characteristics of the grasped are also already transcended. The two are unobstructed, and within this nondual wisdom, one abides in the meaning of suchness.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a12_11']	所言唯心過已二無對礙，是智於中而亦應離，是故自性他性中諸有生性而不可得。	所言唯心過已二無對礙，是智於中而亦應離，是故自性他性中諸有生性而不可得。	What is said to be only mind is already transcended, and the two are unobstructed. This wisdom should also be abandoned within it. Therefore, the nature of arising within self-nature and other-nature is unobtainable.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a14_1']	如應伺察，諸眾生性亦不和合，若取若捨二不實性悉應遠離。	如應伺察，諸眾生性亦不和合，若取若捨二不實性悉應遠離。	As it should be investigated, the nature of all sentient beings is also not united. Grasping and abandoning, the two unreal natures, should all be far removed.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a15_3']	當知一切物性諸有取著，於無二智中皆應捨離。	當知一切物性諸有取著，於無二智中皆應捨離。	It should be known that all natures of things and all attachments within nondual wisdom should be abandoned.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a17_12']	於無對礙無二智中若如是住，即於一切法如實覺了無有自性，彼即能入最上實性，入無分別三摩地門。	於無對礙無二智中若如是住，即於一切法如實覺了無有自性，彼即能入最上實性，入無分別三摩地門。	If one abides thus in non-obstruction and non-dual wisdom, one will truly realize the selflessness of all dharmas, and one will be able to enter the supreme reality and the door of non-discriminating samādhi.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a19_13']	又若於是無對礙無二智中相應住者，是即最上實性中住，是大乘見，如是亦見最上實性。	又若於是無對礙無二智中相應住者，是即最上實性中住，是大乘見，如是亦見最上實性。	Moreover, if one abides in accordance with this non-obstruction and non-dual wisdom, this is abiding in the supreme reality. This is the view of the Great Vehicle, and in this way one also sees the supreme reality.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a21_2']	以見最上實性故，即於一切法慧眼觀空，智光明中皆如實見。	以見最上實性故，即於一切法慧眼觀空，智光明中皆如實見。	Because one sees the supreme reality, one observes emptiness with the wisdom eye of all dharmas, and in the light of wisdom one truly sees everything.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a22_11']	如諸經說，云何見勝義諦？	如諸經說，云何見勝義諦？	As the sūtras say, How does one see the ultimate truth?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a22_18']	謂一切法無見。	謂一切法無見。	It means not seeing any dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a23_3']	此中如是。	此中如是。	Here it is like this.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a25_6']	所言無見者，是勝意樂真實無見，非如世間諸生盲者及瞑目人，緣闕故或不作意故而皆不見。	所言無見者，是勝意樂真實無見，非如世間諸生盲者及瞑目人，緣闕故或不作意故而皆不見。	What is meant by not seeing is the true non-seeing of the supreme intention, not like the worldly blind and those with eyes closed who do not see due to the lack of conditions or lack of attention.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a26_6']	彼等有性顛倒種子悉不能斷，此即不然。	彼等有性顛倒種子悉不能斷，此即不然。	They are unable to completely eliminate the seeds of inverted natures, but this is not so [for the wisdom of the tathāgatas].
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a28_1']	又如入無想定，後或出時還復生起有性取著，貪等根本諸煩惱聚而不解脫。	又如入無想定，後或出時還復生起有性取著，貪等根本諸煩惱聚而不解脫。	Moreover, it is like entering the attainment of the formless realm, and later when emerging, one again gives rise to attachment to existence, the root afflictions such as craving, and so forth, and is not liberated.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568a29_6']	所言有性取著貪等根本煩惱行相，如《聖二諦》等經說。	所言有性取著貪等根本煩惱行相，如《聖二諦》等經說。	As for the characteristics of the root afflictions such as attachment to existence and craving, it is as explained in the sūtras such as the Sūtra on the Two Truths of the Noble Ones.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b02_13']	若復有言，入無分別總持法門，無分別法中離色等相，以決定慧於無色中觀無所得亦無作意，是勝義樂。	若復有言，入無分別總持法門，無分別法中離色等相，以決定慧於無色中觀無所得亦無作意，是勝義樂。	If someone says, Entering the Dharma gate of nondiscriminative dhāraṇī, in the Dharma of nondiscrimination, apart from the characteristics of form and so forth, using definitive wisdom to contemplate the unobtainable in the formless realm and also being without mental activity, this is the ultimate bliss,
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b03_15']	非如無想定等，於諸色等取著法中作意而離。	非如無想定等，於諸色等取著法中作意而離。	it is not like the attainment of the formless realm and so forth, where one is mentally active and detached within the dharmas that are grasped at among forms and so forth.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b05_8']	是故當知，如前所說諸色等中作意離相，若無正慧即不能斷疑惑種子。	是故當知，如前所說諸色等中作意離相，若無正慧即不能斷疑惑種子。	Therefore, one should know that as explained above, if one is mentally active with regard to forms and so forth and apart from characteristics, if one lacks right wisdom, one will be unable to completely eliminate the seeds of doubt.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b06_3']	譬如世間火若存時，諸物燒然。	譬如世間火若存時，諸物燒然。	It is like in the world, when there is fire, things are burned.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b06_12']	云何能離思之一法？	云何能離思之一法？	How can one be free from the single dharma of thought?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b07_2']	若不調止所有邪。	若不調止所有邪。	If one does not subdue all wrong,
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b10_3']	由此當知，所有奢摩他諸所緣中心住堅固，如理所作以慧伺察智光明生，明現暗除智生障滅。	由此當知，所有奢摩他諸所緣中心住堅固，如理所作以慧伺察智光明生，明現暗除智生障滅。	By this one should know that in all samādhis, the mind abides firmly in all objects of cognition, and by the correct practice, wisdom observes and the light of wisdom arises. When the light is manifest, darkness is dispelled and wisdom arises, and obstructions are extinguished.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b11_2']	如人二目隨量無差，於諸分位照明無異；	如人二目隨量無差，於諸分位照明無異；	Just as a person's two eyes are the same size and without difference, and in all positions they illuminate without distinction;
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b11_11']	智光明出亦復如是。	智光明出亦復如是。	The arising of the light of wisdom is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b12_11']	非光明中有冥暗性，明暗二法互相違故。	非光明中有冥暗性，明暗二法互相違故。	It is not that within the light there is the nature of darkness, because the two dharmas of light and darkness mutually contradict each other.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b13_7']	當知三摩地中離冥暗性亦復如是。	當知三摩地中離冥暗性亦復如是。	One should know that in samādhi, being free from the nature of darkness is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b14_2']	若不爾者，云何能住心一境相？	若不爾者，云何能住心一境相？	If it were not so, how could one abide in the single characteristic of the mind?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b15_15']	是故若於三摩呬多中如實了知，即能一向隨順正慧，此中所說悉不相違。	是故若於三摩呬多中如實了知，即能一向隨順正慧，此中所說悉不相違。	Therefore, if one truly understands in samādhi, one will be able to follow right wisdom in one direction, and what is said here will all be consistent.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b17_6']	復次三摩呬多中，應以慧觀都無色相，於一切法悉無所得。	復次三摩呬多中，應以慧觀都無色相，於一切法悉無所得。	Furthermore, in samādhi, one should observe with wisdom that there are no appearances of form at all, and that nothing is attained in all dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b19_8']	彼諸相應分位相中，無所進趣、無所發悟，若自若他悉見無性，有性分別戲論相等一切息滅。	彼諸相應分位相中，無所進趣、無所發悟，若自若他悉見無性，有性分別戲論相等一切息滅。	Within the characteristics of the various corresponding states, there is no progress, no enlightenment. Whether it is oneself or others, all are seen to be without nature. Discriminations of having nature and characteristics of conceptual proliferation are all extinguished.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b21_6']	如是即於正慧所觀無相性中而得相應，有心分別悉不能立，即彼無性亦不可得。	如是即於正慧所觀無相性中而得相應，有心分別悉不能立，即彼無性亦不可得。	In this way, one becomes attuned to the naturelessness that is observed by right wisdom. All discriminations of the mind cannot be established. That naturelessness is also unobtainable.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b22_6']	若於是中或謂有性而可見者，是見應止。	若於是中或謂有性而可見者，是見應止。	If one were to say that having nature can be seen within this, this seeing should be stopped.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b23_4']	如是止已，若於無性分別轉者，此亦不然。	如是止已，若於無性分別轉者，此亦不然。	Having stopped in this way, if one discriminates about naturelessness, this is also not so.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b24_8']	設使有性三時相應，以慧眼觀無相無得，又何止邪？	設使有性三時相應，以慧眼觀無相無得，又何止邪？	Even if having nature is attuned to the three times, observing with the eye of wisdom, there are no characteristics and nothing to attain. Moreover, what is there to stop?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b25_12']	如實義者，有性無性不應分別，一性異性亦不可分別。	如實義者，有性無性不應分別，一性異性亦不可分別。	In the true meaning, having nature and naturelessness should not be discriminated. Having one nature and having different natures are also not discriminable.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b28_5']	是中若離性與無性二分別者，悉能照達諸分別空，即彼能照及所照性亦無所有，如是乃得最上最勝無分別相應。	是中若離性與無性二分別者，悉能照達諸分別空，即彼能照及所照性亦無所有，如是乃得最上最勝無分別相應。	If one is free from the two discriminations of nature and non-nature, one can illuminate all discriminations as empty. The nature of that which illuminates and that which is illuminated also does not exist. In this way, one attains the supreme and most excellent non-discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568b29_17']	此中若住如是相應，即一切分別悉能斷滅，所有煩惱障智障而亦能斷。	此中若住如是相應，即一切分別悉能斷滅，所有煩惱障智障而亦能斷。	If one abides in such a union, then all discriminations are completely extinguished, and all afflictive hindrances and the hindrances to knowledge are also eliminated.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c02_2']	於彼煩惱障不生不滅性中，而性等顛倒根本悉除。	於彼煩惱障不生不滅性中，而性等顛倒根本悉除。	Within the nature of the non-arising and non-ceasing of the afflictive hindrances, the fundamental inversions such as the nature are completely removed.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c05_4']	如《聖二諦》等經說，如是相應行中，一切性等分別斷已普盡，性等顛倒無明自性、煩惱障根本即斷。	如《聖二諦》等經說，如是相應行中，一切性等分別斷已普盡，性等顛倒無明自性、煩惱障根本即斷。	As the sūtras such as the Noble Two Truths say, within this practice of union, all discriminations such as nature are completely eliminated, and the fundamental afflictive hindrances such as the nature of the inversion of ignorance are eliminated.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c05_19']	彼根本斷已，諸煩惱障而悉能斷。	彼根本斷已，諸煩惱障而悉能斷。	When those fundamental [afflictive hindrances] are eliminated, all afflictive hindrances are completely eliminated.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c06_17']	又如《聖二諦經》中，問妙吉祥菩薩言：	又如《聖二諦經》中，問妙吉祥菩薩言：	Moreover, as the Noble Sūtra of the Two Truths asks Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva:
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c07_5']	云何能得煩惱調伏？	云何能得煩惱調伏？	How can one subdue the afflictions?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c07_14']	云何而能了知煩惱？	云何而能了知煩惱？	How can one understand afflictions?
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c07_19']	妙吉祥言：	妙吉祥言：	Mañjuśrī said:
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c08_8']	勝義諦中畢竟不生。	勝義諦中畢竟不生。	In the ultimate truth, they are ultimately unborn.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c10_6']	彼一切法無生性中，世俗皆是不實顛倒，應當止息一切性等所起顛倒思惟分別。	彼一切法無生性中，世俗皆是不實顛倒，應當止息一切性等所起顛倒思惟分別。	In the nature of non-arising of all dharmas, the conventional is all unreal and inverted, and one should cease all inverted thoughts and discriminations that arise from the natures, etc.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c12_5']	若彼思惟分別不止息者即有我共相，既有我共相即起立諸見，若見起立即煩惱轉。	若彼思惟分別不止息者即有我共相，既有我共相即起立諸見，若見起立即煩惱轉。	If those thoughts and discriminations are not ceased, then there is the common characteristic of self. Having the common characteristic of self, one gives rise to various views. If views arise, then afflictions turn.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c12_8']	天子！	天子！	Heavenly son!
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c13_16']	若能了知勝義諦中一切法畢竟無生，即勝義諦具十種無顛倒。	若能了知勝義諦中一切法畢竟無生，即勝義諦具十種無顛倒。	If one can understand that in the ultimate truth, all dharmas are ultimately unborn, then the ultimate truth is endowed with ten kinds of non-inversion.
['ZH_T32_1664_003:0568c17_11']	若勝義諦中無顛倒即無分別，若無分別得滅相應，若滅相應彼我共相即不能得，若我共相既不能得，而彼諸見不能起立，乃至勝義諦中涅槃之見亦復不起。	若勝義諦中無顛倒即無分別，若無分別得滅相應，若滅相應彼我共相即不能得，若我共相既不能得，而彼諸見不能起立，乃至勝義諦中涅槃之見亦復不起。	If there is no inversion in the ultimate truth, then there is no discrimination. If there is no discrimination, one attains cessation and accord. If there is cessation and accord, then one cannot attain the common characteristic of self. If one cannot attain the common characteristic of self, then one cannot give rise to various views, and even the view of nirvana in the ultimate truth does not arise.
