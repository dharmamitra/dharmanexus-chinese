As the eighth chapter of the Nyāyānusāra śāstra says, the Vaibhāṣika school believes that present form and mind, etc. are the causes of defilement and purity.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c16_15']	意云：	意云：	009	The meaning is as follows:
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c17_8']	如大乘中第八為所熏故。	如大乘中第八為所熏故。	009	just as in the Mahāyāna, the eighth consciousness is what is perfumed.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c18_5']	二者三毒為因，義如大乘能熏故。	二者三毒為因，義如大乘能熏故。	009	Second, the three poisons are the cause, the meaning is like the Mahāyāna, which is what perfumes.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c18_17']	今引《阿含》但證三毒耳。	今引《阿含》但證三毒耳。	009	Now, the Āgamas are only quoted to prove the three poisons.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c19_16']	而云等者，謂以三毒為因緣故，起於三業。	而云等者，謂以三毒為因緣故，起於三業。	009	And it is said etc., meaning that because the three poisons are the causes and conditions, the three karmas arise.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c20_14']	三業因緣故起於三界，是故有一切法。	三業因緣故起於三界，是故有一切法。	009	The three karmas give rise to the three realms through causes and conditions, and therefore there are all dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c21_18']	《中論．十二因緣品》頌云「眾生癡所覆，為後起三行。	《中論．十二因緣品》頌云「眾生癡所覆，為後起三行。	009	A verse from the Madhyamaka-śāstra, chapter on the twelve links of dependent arising, states: Sentient beings, covered by delusion, give rise to the three kinds of actions afterwards.

['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c23_15']	三者合取上二義，同有能所熏方流轉故。	三者合取上二義，同有能所熏方流轉故。	009	Third, combining the above two meanings, they both have the ability to perfume and flow in order to revolve.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c24_4']	若爾，焉異大乘？	若爾，焉異大乘？	009	If so, how is it different from the Mahāyāna?
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c26_9']	然似參經意，而不同者但六識非第八為所熏，縱說賴耶但有名字，能熏又非七識，故全不同。	然似參經意，而不同者但六識非第八為所熏，縱說賴耶但有名字，能熏又非七識，故全不同。	009	However, it seems to accord with the meaning of the sūtras, but it is different in that the six consciousnesses are not the eighth consciousness as the perfumable, and even if it speaks of the ālaya, it is only a name, and the perfuming is also not the seventh consciousness, so it is completely different.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c27_7']	疏「未盡法源」下，第四結成不了，可知。	疏「未盡法源」下，第四結成不了，可知。	009	The passage not exhausting the source of dharmas in the commentary, fourth, concludes that it is not yet complete, which can be understood.

['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c28_16']	今初，分二：	今初，分二：	009	Now, the first is divided into two:
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0062c29_7']	先對後彰劣、後對前顯勝。	先對後彰劣、後對前顯勝。	009	First, showing inferiority by contrasting with the later; later, showing superiority by contrasting with the former.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a01_3']	前中，以相多性少故，言法相宗。	前中，以相多性少故，言法相宗。	009	In the former, because characteristics are many and natures are few, it is called the Dharma Characteristics School.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a02_12']	言「所說法性即法相數」者，說真如法性乃是百法之中六無為數。	言「所說法性即法相數」者，說真如法性乃是百法之中六無為數。	009	As for the nature of dharmas spoken of are the number of characteristics of dharmas, it means that the true suchness of dharmas is the number of the six unconditioned dharmas among the one hundred dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a03_6']	後「說有百法」下，對前彰勝。	後「說有百法」下，對前彰勝。	009	Below speaking of the existence of one hundred dharmas, it shows the superiority over the previous.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a05_13']	言百法者，謂心法有八、心所有五十一、色有十一、不相應行有二十四、無為有六，故成百數。	言百法者，謂心法有八、心所有五十一、色有十一、不相應行有二十四、無為有六，故成百數。	009	As for the one hundred dharmas, it means there are eight mental dharmas, fifty-one mental factors, eleven forms, twenty-four non-associated compositional factors, and six unconditioned dharmas, thus totaling one hundred.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a07_1']	於前七十五中加二十五，謂心法加七，小乘唯一意識故；	於前七十五中加二十五，謂心法加七，小乘唯一意識故；	009	Among the previous seventy-five, twenty-five are added, namely, mental dharmas add seven, because the Hinayana has only one consciousness;
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a07_6']	心所加五；	心所加五；	009	mental factors add five;
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a07_13']	不相應行加十；	不相應行加十；	009	non-associated compositional factors add ten;
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a08_3']	無為加三，並如彼說。	無為加三，並如彼說。	009	unconditioned dharmas add three, all as explained there.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a08_17']	疏「說有八識」下，第二別明。	疏「說有八識」下，第二別明。	009	Speaking of the existence of eight consciousnesses and below is the second specific explanation.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a12_7']	文有九節，即前會二宗中十對之內法相宗中十義，而皆如次對前，唯第一當第三，第二當第一及第二者，以第三唯心真妄為對，六識三毒為所依故。	文有九節，即前會二宗中十對之內法相宗中十義，而皆如次對前，唯第一當第三，第二當第一及第二者，以第三唯心真妄為對，六識三毒為所依故。	009	The text has nine sections, which correspond to the ten meanings within the Dharma characteristics school in the previous section on reconciling the two schools, but they all correspond to the previous in order. Only the first corresponds to the third, and the second corresponds to the first and second, because the third only takes true and false mind as the correspondence, and the six consciousnesses and three poisons as the basis.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a12_10']	今初。	今初。	009	Now, the first.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a13_3']	第一云何對前說有八識？	第一云何對前說有八識？	009	How does the first correspond to the previous statement of the existence of the eight consciousnesses?
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a13_14']	為所依故說八，過前教。	為所依故說八，過前教。	009	It is said that there are eight consciousnesses as the basis, surpassing the previous teachings.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a14_7']	「唯是生滅」，明其劣後。	「唯是生滅」，明其劣後。	009	Only arising and ceasing clarifies its inferiority to the later [teachings].
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a16_10']	「依生滅識建立生死及涅槃因」者，不同前教以明三毒六識為因，不同終教不生滅與生滅和合。	「依生滅識建立生死及涅槃因」者，不同前教以明三毒六識為因，不同終教不生滅與生滅和合。	009	Based on the arising and ceasing consciousnesses, the causes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are established is different from the previous teachings that take the three poisons and six consciousnesses as causes, and is different from the final teaching that non-arising and ceasing are united with arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a18_4']	故《攝論》第一云「無始時來界，一切法等依，由此有諸趣，及涅槃證得。	故《攝論》第一云「無始時來界，一切法等依，由此有諸趣，及涅槃證得。	009	Therefore, the first chapter of the Compendium Treatise says: Since beginningless time, the realm is the basis of all dharmas, and because of this, there are the various destinies and the attainment of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a18_21']	」界即因義，謂種子識等，下文廣說。	」界即因義，謂種子識等，下文廣說。	009	Dhatu means cause, referring to the seeds of consciousness, which will be explained in detail below.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a21_8']	疏「法爾種子」下，即第二對，一性五性別中五性之義，含前第一對，一乘三乘別中三乘之義，以乘性相成故。	疏「法爾種子」下，即第二對，一性五性別中五性之義，含前第一對，一乘三乘別中三乘之義，以乘性相成故。	009	The seeds that exist by the nature of things is the second pair, among the distinctions of one nature and five natures, it contains the meaning of the five natures. It also contains the meaning of the three vehicles among the distinctions of one vehicle and three vehicles, because the vehicle and nature are mutually established.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a23_6']	但明五性則有三乘，而三乘但是化法，非所詮中別義，故略不明，含在五性之中。	但明五性則有三乘，而三乘但是化法，非所詮中別義，故略不明，含在五性之中。	009	But if only the five natures are explained, there are three vehicles, and the three vehicles are just the teaching methods, not the distinct meanings in the text, so they are not explained in detail, but are contained within the five natures.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a24_3']	言「法爾」者，此明本有揀異新熏。	言「法爾」者，此明本有揀異新熏。	009	As for the nature of things, this clarifies that they exist originally and are different from newly perfumed [seeds].
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a24_17']	故《瑜伽》云「種性略有二種：	故《瑜伽》云「種性略有二種：	009	Therefore, the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says, The seeds are generally of two kinds:
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a25_6']	一本性住、二習所成。	一本性住、二習所成。	009	First, those that exist by the nature of things; second, those that are perfumed and produced.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a27_1']	本性住者，謂諸菩薩六處殊勝，有如是相，從無始世展轉傳來，法爾所得等。	本性住者，謂諸菩薩六處殊勝，有如是相，從無始世展轉傳來，法爾所得等。	009	Those that exist by the nature of things refer to the six sense bases of bodhisattvas that are superior, having such characteristics, transmitted from beginningless time, obtained by the nature of things, and so on.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a27_15']	習所成者，謂先慣習善根所得。	習所成者，謂先慣習善根所得。	009	Those that are perfumed and produced refer to those obtained through previously cultivated roots of goodness.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a28_8']	」《顯揚論》云「云何種性差別？	」《顯揚論》云「云何種性差別？	009	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says: What is the difference in lineage?
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063a29_2']	五種道理，一切界差別可得故。	五種道理，一切界差別可得故。	009	Because the five principles can be found in all distinctions of realms.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063b01_3']	」五中前四為有、後一為無，故云「有無永別」。	」五中前四為有、後一為無，故云「有無永別」。	009	Among the five, the first four are existence and the last one is non-existence, therefore it says existence and non-existence are eternally separate.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063b02_10']	疏「既所立識唯業惑生」等者，第三明真如隨緣凝然別中凝然義。	疏「既所立識唯業惑生」等者，第三明真如隨緣凝然別中凝然義。	009	The commentary says Since the established consciousnesses are only born from karma and afflictions and so on, the third clarifies the meaning of stillness within the distinction of true suchness following conditions and stillness.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063b03_2']	上一句躡前生滅識起。	上一句躡前生滅識起。	009	The previous sentence continues from the arising of the consciousness of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063b05_3']	言業惑者，以現行第八名異熟識，由過去煩惱及業熏習成種，招此識果酬引業故。	言業惑者，以現行第八名異熟識，由過去煩惱及業熏習成種，招此識果酬引業故。	009	As for karma and afflictions, the present eighth consciousness is called the consciousness of retribution, because it is perfumed by the seeds of past afflictions and karma, which attract this consciousness as a result to repay the leading karma.
['ZH_T36_1736_009:0063b06_13']	其前六識酬滿業者，從異熟起，名異熟生，不名異熟，有間斷故。	其前六識酬滿業者，從異熟起，名異熟生，不名異熟，有間斷故。	009	As for the first six consciousnesses repaying the full karma, they arise from the consciousness of retribution and are called born of retribution, not called retribution, because they are interrupted.
