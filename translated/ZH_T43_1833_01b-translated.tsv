['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a03_1']	俱生分別豈外道許。	俱生分別豈外道許。	How could the innate and discriminating [afflictions] be accepted by non-Buddhists?
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a03_15']	彼宗既無今標明彼分別．俱生。	彼宗既無今標明彼分別．俱生。	Since their school does not have the present heading, it clarifies their discrimination and innate [aspects].

['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a05_10']	言我執至皆名執者。	言我執至皆名執者。	As for the words self-attachment, up to all are called attachment,
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a06_6']	若言我見不通心王．及餘心所。	若言我見不通心王．及餘心所。	if it is said that the view of self does not extend to the mental faculty and other mental factors,
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a06_11']	執言寬故。	執言寬故。	because the word attachment is broad,🔽it includes the mind and mental factors that occur simultaneously with the view, all of which are called attachment.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a07_14']	該見同時心．心所等皆名為執　或言我執亦唯是見。	該見同時心．心所等皆名為執　或言我執亦唯是見。	Or it is said that self-attachment is also only the view.

['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a11_6']	一云。	一云。	The first says:
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a12_1']	第七現相隨於見．質通於二性。	第七現相隨於見．質通於二性。	The seventh consciousness's perceived part follows the seeing part and the substance, and extends to both natures.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a12_6']	此相熏種。	此相熏種。	This perceived part perfumes seeds.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a12_15']	種隨現相亦名二性。	種隨現相亦名二性。	The seeds follow the perceived part and are also called both natures.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a13_12']	後相依此二性種生名雜引生　二云。	後相依此二性種生名雜引生　二云。	Later, the seventh consciousness arises based on the seeds of these two natures, and is called mixed and induced. The second explanation is that
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a14_3']	此第七相或質同種。	此第七相或質同種。	the seventh consciousness either has the same seeds as the substance,
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a14_8']	或見同種。	或見同種。	or the same seeds as the seeing part.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a14_14']	種稱雜引也。	種稱雜引也。	The seeds are called mixed and induced.🔽The mixture of natures can be understood.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a15_6']	性雜可知　前解為勝。	性雜可知　前解為勝。	The former explanation is superior,
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a15_15']	許第七相別有種故。	許第七相別有種故。	because it is accepted that the seventh consciousness has separate seeds.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a16_1', 'ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a16_12']	疏。🔽不稱本質至名為有執者。	疏。 不稱本質至名為有執者。	The commentary says:🔽The five consciousnesses do not correspond to the external substance, and are therefore called with grasping.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a17_9']	五識不親緣自外質名為不稱　有云。	五識不親緣自外質名為不稱　有云。	Some say:
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a18_9']	初禪眼識見欲火災相分與質不相似故。	初禪眼識見欲火災相分與質不相似故。	The eye consciousness of the first dhyāna seeing the appearance of the fire calamity of the desire realm does not resemble the substance in the appearance part,🔽because it arises from separate seeds.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a18_17']	別種生故　詳曰。	別種生故　詳曰。	This is analyzed as follows:
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a19_13']	當地五識所緣質．相豈同種耶。	當地五識所緣質．相豈同種耶。	How can the substance and appearance parts of the five consciousnesses of the same stage have the same seeds?
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a19_18']	復云何稱。	復云何稱。	How can they be said to correspond?
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a20_11']	若言異地不稱義顯故舉之者。	若言異地不稱義顯故舉之者。	If it is said that the example is given to show that those of different stages do not correspond,
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a20_16']	亦為不可。	亦為不可。	that is also unacceptable.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a21_7']	便疑同地種同相稱。	便疑同地種同相稱。	It would then be suspected that those of the same stage with the same seeds correspond.

['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a22_10']	緣識所變五取蘊者。	緣識所變五取蘊者。	The five aggregates that are grasped, which are transformations of consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a23_13']	問此五取蘊何識所變　答有義除第六識餘七識變。	問此五取蘊何識所變　答有義除第六識餘七識變。	Answer: There is an interpretation that the other seven consciousnesses transform them, excluding the sixth consciousness.🔽The sixth consciousness, when it transforms, separately speaks of the arising of its own mental image, and it grasps that as a self. Question: If it is the substance of the other consciousnesses, why is it said that it has as objects only the transformations of consciousness?
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a26_7']	第六所變自親相分下文別說起自心相執為我故　問若是本質如何但說緣識所變　答理實亦因餘能變之識。	第六所變自親相分下文別說起自心相執為我故　問若是本質如何但說緣識所變　答理實亦因餘能變之識。	Answer: In reality, it is also caused by the other consciousnesses that transform.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a26_17']	說所變言依相．見故。	說所變言依相．見故。	The words “that which is transformed” are based on the images and seeing parts of consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a27_7']	實理親緣唯所變相。	實理親緣唯所變相。	In reality, the immediate cause is only the transformed images.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a27_16']	若依本質亦緣能變。	若依本質亦緣能變。	If it is based on the substance of the other consciousnesses, then it has as objects also that which transforms.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a28_7']	此隨相顯說所變言。	此隨相顯說所變言。	This is said because the words “that which is transformed” are based on the images.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a28_16']	實亦不應言識所變。	實亦不應言識所變。	In reality, it should not be said that it is the transformation of consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a29_7']	不爾前執應說變言。	不爾前執應說變言。	Otherwise, the previous grasping should be said to be a transformation.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825a29_16']	前既但言緣第八識。	前既但言緣第八識。	Since the previous consciousness is said only to have as its object the eighth consciousness,🔽this consciousness should also only have as its object the five appropriated aggregates. Question: What is meant by appropriated aggregates?

['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825b02_13']	以取合故名為取蘊。	以取合故名為取蘊。	They are called appropriated aggregates because they are appropriated and combined.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825b02_15', 'ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825b03_4']	釋。🔽合是和義．順義。	釋。 合是和義．順義。	The commentary explains:🔽“Combined” means the meaning of harmony and the meaning of conformity.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825b03_11']	不相離相資義。	不相離相資義。	It means the characteristic of nonseparation and mutual assistance.
['ZH_T43_1833_01b:0825b04_2']	由蘊與取更相和順。	由蘊與取更相和順。	Because the aggregates and grasping mutually accord with each other.
