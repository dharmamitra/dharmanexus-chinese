['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b09_6']	」想陰若存，寤即想像，寐即成夢。	」想陰若存，寤即想像，寐即成夢。	If the aggregate of thoughts exists, then when awake, it becomes imagination, and when asleep, it becomes dreams.

['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b11_13']	寤寐一者，雖有寤寐，以無想故，寤亦如寐，寐亦如寤，故云恒一。	寤寐一者，雖有寤寐，以無想故，寤亦如寐，寐亦如寤，故云恒一。	Being one in both waking and sleeping means that although there is waking and sleeping, due to the absence of thoughts, waking is also like sleeping, and sleeping is also like waking, so it is said to be always one.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b12_18']	「覺明虛靜猶如晴空，無復麁重前塵影事。	「覺明虛靜猶如晴空，無復麁重前塵影事。	The clear and bright awareness is empty and still, like a clear sky, and there are no more coarse and heavy shadows of external objects.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b13_9']	」圓明心體，名為覺明。	」圓明心體，名為覺明。	The perfectly clear and bright mind essence is called clear and bright awareness.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b13_19']	離想浮動，故名虛靜。	離想浮動，故名虛靜。	Being free from the floating and moving thoughts, it is called empty and still.

Although there are sense faculties and consciousnesses that take various objects as conditions, yet one does not think of images and fixate one's thoughts in the mind. Therefore, it is like a mirror reflecting objects without traces. It merely receives in vain, illuminates in vain, and responds in vain.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b21_11']	亦可如鏡照於光明，雖鑒無影，故云虛受。	亦可如鏡照於光明，雖鑒無影，故云虛受。	Alternatively, it can be said that a mirror reflects light. Although it reflects without shadows, it is said to receive in vain.

['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b28_10']	顯此行人得想陰盡，唯識陰及行陰在。	顯此行人得想陰盡，唯識陰及行陰在。	This shows that this practitioner, having exhausted the aggregate of perceptions, only has the aggregates of consciousness and formations remaining.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956b29_8']	今此行陰又現披露，故名識陰為精真也。	今此行陰又現披露，故名識陰為精真也。	Now, as the aggregate of formations is further revealed, the aggregate of consciousness is called the pure essence.

['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c04_5']	「生滅根元從此披露，見諸十方十二眾生畢殫其類，雖未通其各命由緒，見同生基，猶如野馬熠熠清擾，為浮根塵究竟樞穴，此則名為行陰區宇。	「生滅根元從此披露，見諸十方十二眾生畢殫其類，雖未通其各命由緒，見同生基，猶如野馬熠熠清擾，為浮根塵究竟樞穴，此則名為行陰區宇。	The root source of birth and death is revealed from here. One sees the end of the types of the twelve classes of sentient beings in the ten directions. Although one has not yet understood the origin of each individual's life, one sees the basis of shared birth, which is like a mirage, flickering and disturbed. It is the ultimate pivot of the floating sense faculties and objects. This is called the domain of the aggregate of formations.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c05_1']	」行陰是生滅元，以遷流造作故。	」行陰是生滅元，以遷流造作故。	The aggregate of formations is the source of birth and death, because it creates through transition and change.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c05_11']	想盡行現，故云披露。	想盡行現，故云披露。	When thoughts are exhausted, formations manifest, so it says revealed.

['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c09_13']	未通各命者，雖已了知十二類生總從行出，而未知眾生別種在識陰中，此即本識業苦種子是眾生各別性命因由端緒也。	未通各命者，雖已了知十二類生總從行出，而未知眾生別種在識陰中，此即本識業苦種子是眾生各別性命因由端緒也。	Not yet understood means although one has already understood that the twelve types of sentient beings all arise from formations, one has not yet understood the individual seeds of sentient beings that exist in the aggregate of consciousness. This refers to the seeds of karma and suffering in the fundamental consciousness, which are the basis for the individual life and death of sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c11_4']	見同生基者，同分生基，即行陰也，十二品類同以行陰為其基本。	見同生基者，同分生基，即行陰也，十二品類同以行陰為其基本。	Seeing the same life basis means the same life basis is the aggregate of formations. The twelve categories all take the aggregate of formations as their basic foundation.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c11_20']	猶如野馬者，塵合陽氣，鼓而為之。	猶如野馬者，塵合陽氣，鼓而為之。	Just like a mirage means dust and heat waves gather and stir to form it.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c12_13']	熠熠，即光起閃爍，喻生滅也。	熠熠，即光起閃爍，喻生滅也。	Flickering refers to the light arising and flashing, which is a metaphor for birth and death.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c14_2']	清擾者，即此行陰擾動，生滅微細不停，以無想陰塵垢，故名清也。	清擾者，即此行陰擾動，生滅微細不停，以無想陰塵垢，故名清也。	Clear and agitated means this aggregate of formations is agitated and moving, with subtle and unceasing birth and death. Since there is no aggregate of perceptions and dust of defilements, it is called clear.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c15_11']	為浮根塵究竟樞穴者，門簨曰樞，門臼曰穴，此皆動轉之要處也。	為浮根塵究竟樞穴者，門簨曰樞，門臼曰穴，此皆動轉之要處也。	Being the ultimate pivot point of the floating faculties and objects - the pivot is the door hinge, and the hole is the door socket. These are all places of movement and turning.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c16_19']	根塵、生滅皆以行陰為機紐處，了知此者正在行陰，故云區宇。	根塵、生滅皆以行陰為機紐處，了知此者正在行陰，故云區宇。	The faculties, objects, and birth and death all take the aggregate of formations as the place of mechanism and connection. One who understands this is precisely in the aggregate of formations, hence it is called domain.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c17_5']	二、明盡相。	二、明盡相。	Second, clarifying the characteristics of completion.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c19_12']	「若此清擾熠熠元性，性入元澄，一澄元習，如波瀾滅化為澄水，名行陰盡。	「若此清擾熠熠元性，性入元澄，一澄元習，如波瀾滅化為澄水，名行陰盡。	If this clear agitation and flickering primordial nature enters the primordial clarity, and the one clear primordial habit is like the cessation of waves and currents transforming into still water, it is called the completion of the aggregate of formations.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c20_16']	是人則能超眾生濁，觀其所由，幽隱妄想以為其本。	是人則能超眾生濁，觀其所由，幽隱妄想以為其本。	Such a person can transcend the turbidity of sentient beings. Observing its source, it is based on the hidden and deluded thoughts.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c22_2']	」性入元澄者，行陰若盡，遷流性澄，歸一藏識，名入元澄。	」性入元澄者，行陰若盡，遷流性澄，歸一藏識，名入元澄。	The nature enters the primordial clarity means that if the activity aggregate is exhausted, the nature of transition and flux becomes clear and returns to the store consciousness, which is called entering the primordial clarity.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c22_13']	經云「藏識海常住」也。	經云「藏識海常住」也。	The sutra says, The ocean of the store consciousness always abides.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c24_2']	以觀行增勝，能純生滅根元習氣，令其不動，歸一識陰，猶如澄水也。	以觀行增勝，能純生滅根元習氣，令其不動，歸一識陰，猶如澄水也。	By increasing the power of contemplation and practice, one can make the pure root source of birth and cessation and the habitual tendencies of the activity aggregate unmoving and return to the single consciousness aggregate, like still water.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c25_4']	以行是眾生遷流業性故，此若盡即超眾生濁也。	以行是眾生遷流業性故，此若盡即超眾生濁也。	Because the activity aggregate is the nature of the karma of sentient beings' transition and flux, if it is exhausted, one then transcends the turbidity of sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c25_18']	行陰生滅微細難覺，故名幽隱。	行陰生滅微細難覺，故名幽隱。	The birth and cessation of the activity aggregate is subtle and difficult to perceive, so it is called hidden and concealed.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0956c26_8']	二、正明現境，十：	二、正明現境，十：	Second, directly clarifying the present realm, in ten parts:

['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0957a01_19']	方得精研，窮生類本，於本類中生元露者，觀彼幽清圓擾動元，於圓元中起計度者，是人墜入二無因論。	方得精研，窮生類本，於本類中生元露者，觀彼幽清圓擾動元，於圓元中起計度者，是人墜入二無因論。	Only then can one thoroughly investigate and reach the origin of the classes of beings. Within the origin of the classes, the source of life is revealed. Observing that subtle, clear, and perfectly moving origin, within the perfect source, one gives rise to speculation. This person falls into the two theories of no cause.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0957a02_16']	」止觀增勝，想念不起，故云疑明正心。	」止觀增勝，想念不起，故云疑明正心。	The cessation and contemplation become increasingly superior, and thoughts do not arise, so it is said that doubts and clarity are the correct mind.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0957a03_11']	欲界愛染不生，故云魔不得便。	欲界愛染不生，故云魔不得便。	Attachment to desire in the desire realm does not arise, so it is said that demons cannot take advantage.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0957a04_19']	於此推窮生類之本，唯一行陰幽隱清虛，以為一切生滅之元。	於此推窮生類之本，唯一行陰幽隱清虛，以為一切生滅之元。	In this investigation of the origin of the classes of beings, there is only the hidden and clear activity of the aggregate of activity, taken as the source of all arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0957a07_1']	今既披露，此外更無眾生之本，便執世間無因而起，以不知善惡因由、差別種子在識陰故。	今既披露，此外更無眾生之本，便執世間無因而起，以不知善惡因由、差別種子在識陰故。	Now that it has been revealed, there is no other basis for sentient beings outside of this. One then grasps that the world arises without cause, not knowing that the seeds of good and evil distinctions are in the aggregate of consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1799_10a:0957a08_15']	即外道論因此而有，皆修行至此，邪慧忽生，名為見發，非是本來別有外道。	即外道論因此而有，皆修行至此，邪慧忽生，名為見發，非是本來別有外道。	Heretical theories arise from this. All practitioners reach this point, and heretical wisdom suddenly arises, called the manifestation of views, not that there were originally separate heretics.

This is also the point where the power of the aggregate of formations is exhausted.
