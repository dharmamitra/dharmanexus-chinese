What are the two? First, the perfuming of the intrinsic nature; second, the perfuming of function. As for the perfuming of the intrinsic nature, from beginningless time it is endowed with pure dharmas and possesses inconceivable functions, serving as the nature of objects. Based on these two meanings, it constantly perfumes. Because it has power, it can cause sentient beings to detest the suffering of birth and death, delight in seeking nirvana, and believe in their own minds that there is the dharma of true suchness, giving rise to the aspiration to practice.

Why are there differences in faith and lack of faith, and in the quantity and sequence of [practices]? They should all spontaneously know that there is the dharma of true suchness, diligently cultivate expedient means, and so forth, and enter nirvāṇa? In the question,

Therefore, the afflictions that are above the sands of the Ganges River arise from ignorance with differences, and the afflictions of the view of self and attachment arise from ignorance with differences. In this way, all afflictions arise from ignorance with immeasurable differences before and after, which only the Tathāgata can know. The answer has two parts.

However, these bodhisattvas still make distinctions because they have not yet entered the stage of the Dharma body. If they attain the pure mind, what they see will be subtle and its function will be increasingly superior, up to the end of the stage of bodhisattva where they will see it to the ultimate.
