As in the five methods of stopping [afflictions], they fully treat the three poisons. The correct use of the small vehicle can treat turbidities, so it belongs to the third aspect.

Person refers to sentient beings, while dharma refers to the other four. Because they are contrasted with birth, they all become dharma, which are the speculations of birth.

The two rewards of the dependent and the correct are all formed from the three fabrications. Now, following the distinctions, they are discussed separately, thus the separate correspondences.

Therefore, it is said that the name is common to both places. The detailed explanation is fully like the fifth record of the Śamathavipaśyanā.

['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241a18_6']	「命短」下長短門，一劫之中數數生故，故長短別，此乃約人及以欲天見佛處說，若論初禪即劫命等，二禪已去劫短命長，乃至無色準說可知。	「命短」下長短門，一劫之中數數生故，故長短別，此乃約人及以欲天見佛處說，若論初禪即劫命等，二禪已去劫短命長，乃至無色準說可知。	Short life and so on are the gates of long and short. Because they are born again and again within one kalpa, there are differences in length and shortness. This is said from the perspective of where humans and desire heavens see the Buddha. If discussing the first dhyāna heaven, the kalpa and life are equal. In the second dhyāna heaven and above, the kalpa is short but life is long. Up to the formless realm, the explanation can be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241a22_9']	「三通長短」者，煩惱在凡故長、在聖故短，諸見在餘凡夫故長、在利根外道故短，亦可在餘凡夫故短、在鈍根外道故長，亦可在小故短一生斷故、在大故長留惑潤生入生死故。	「三通長短」者，煩惱在凡故長、在聖故短，諸見在餘凡夫故長、在利根外道故短，亦可在餘凡夫故短、在鈍根外道故長，亦可在小故短一生斷故、在大故長留惑潤生入生死故。	As for the length and shortness of the three periods, afflictions are long in ordinary beings and short in noble ones. Views are long in other ordinary beings and short in sharp-facultied non-Buddhists. They are also short in other ordinary beings and long in dull-facultied non-Buddhists. They are also short in the Lesser Vehicle because they are eliminated in one lifetime and long in the Great Vehicle because one retains afflictions to nourish rebirth and enter into birth and death.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241a23_5']	又見前盡為短、煩惱後盡為長。	又見前盡為短、煩惱後盡為長。	Moreover, the exhaustion of views is short and the exhaustion of afflictions is long.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241a24_7']	今分別濁入生死者，不名為濁，眾生準說。	今分別濁入生死者，不名為濁，眾生準說。	Now, as for distinguishing the defilements that enter into birth and death, they are not called defilements, and sentient beings are explained accordingly.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241a26_12']	「劫但」下帶不帶門，命是不相應行法，須帶陰法論長短時，餘並屬法非不帶時，非親帶故但在於法。	「劫但」下帶不帶門，命是不相應行法，須帶陰法論長短時，餘並屬法非不帶時，非親帶故但在於法。	As for the gate of whether or not they are accompanied, life is a non-associated compositional factor, and it must be discussed in terms of length and shortness in terms of the aggregates. The others all belong to phenomena and are not unaccompanied, because they are not directly accompanied, they are only in the phenomena.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241a28_1']	「劫通」下內外門，大劫害器故名為外，小劫害人故名為內；	「劫通」下內外門，大劫害器故名為外，小劫害人故名為內；	As for the gate of internal and external, the great eon harms the vessel and is therefore called external, the small eon harms people and is therefore called internal;
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241a28_12']	或可四濁聚時時通內外。	或可四濁聚時時通內外。	Or the four defilements may gather at times, and those times are both internal and external.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b01_4']	「三小」下害不害門，物即外器，大劫起時人已上生，隨三不同生三禪處。	「三小」下害不害門，物即外器，大劫起時人已上生，隨三不同生三禪處。	The three small below is the door of harm and non-harm. The objects refer to the external environment. When the great kalpa arises, people are born above, born in the three dhyāna heavens according to the three differences.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b02_9']	「小劫」下五道三界門，準應別論，三五相參，故合明之。	「小劫」下五道三界門，準應別論，三五相參，故合明之。	The small kalpa below is the door of the five paths and three realms. It should be discussed separately, with the three and five mixed, so it is explained together.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b02_14']	通色如前。	通色如前。	The common form is as before.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b04_6']	言「命通」者，亦應云餘四通於三界五道，命通具如《俱舍》中明。	言「命通」者，亦應云餘四通於三界五道，命通具如《俱舍》中明。	As for the common life span, it should also be said that the other four are common to the three realms and five paths. The common life span is fully explained in the Abhidharma-kośa.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b05_13']	五道壽別，人間五十年等，亦應云通於四生，四生各有長短故也。	五道壽別，人間五十年等，亦應云通於四生，四生各有長短故也。	The differences in life span of the five paths, such as fifty human years, should also be said to be common to the four modes of birth, because each of the four modes of birth has long and short life spans.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b06_2']	「劫是」下共別門。	「劫是」下共別門。	The kalpa is below is the door of common and separate.

['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b06_23']	「從八萬」下釋大小劫。	「從八萬」下釋大小劫。	From eighty thousand below explains the large and small kalpas.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b09_13']	言「正三毒」者，他方淨土如阿閦國，亦有女人無邪欲故，舉一準餘諸可例識，廣歷諸土分別不同，故注「云云」。	言「正三毒」者，他方淨土如阿閦國，亦有女人無邪欲故，舉一準餘諸可例識，廣歷諸土分別不同，故注「云云」。	As for the right three poisons, in the pure lands of other directions, such as the land of Akṣobhya, there are also women, but because there is no deviant desire, by mentioning one, the rest can be understood by analogy. Extensively traversing the various lands, the distinctions are not the same, so the commentary says and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b11_1']	「敦真」者，敦實得者故斥言非，上慢亦然，終無實得而不信者。	「敦真」者，敦實得者故斥言非，上慢亦然，終無實得而不信者。	As for upholding the true, it is because one truly attains it that one refutes what is not. Arrogance is also like this, and in the end there is no real attainment without faith.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b11_8']	「嗣」亦繼也。	「嗣」亦繼也。	To succeed also means to continue.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b13_2']	「身尚無量」者，小乘教中不說更有界外生處，有計變易在界內者，亦名生處；	「身尚無量」者，小乘教中不說更有界外生處，有計變易在界內者，亦名生處；	As for the body is still immeasurable, in the teachings of the Lesser Vehicle, it is not said that there are other places of rebirth outside the realms. Some who calculate the transformation and change are within the realms, and they are also called places of rebirth.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b14_1']	大乘教中既其變易生處多故，故云無量。	大乘教中既其變易生處多故，故云無量。	In the teachings of the Great Vehicle, since there are many places of rebirth through transformation and change, it is said to be immeasurable.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b15_1']	此述逼意，言中但云「名增上慢」，意指羅漢。	此述逼意，言中但云「名增上慢」，意指羅漢。	This describes the meaning of urgency. In the words, it only says called arrogance, but the meaning refers to arhats.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b15_14']	若實得者豈有不發大心者耶？	若實得者豈有不發大心者耶？	If one truly attains it, how could there be one who does not give rise to the great mind?
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b16_5']	乃以大乘密而斥之。	乃以大乘密而斥之。	It is with the secret of the Great Vehicle that one rebukes it.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b17_5']	若謂究竟應變易盡，若未盡者何以不信？	若謂究竟應變易盡，若未盡者何以不信？	If it is said that it should change and end in the end, if it has not yet ended, why not believe it?
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b18_4']	「值遇餘佛」者，初文以有餘土佛名為餘佛。	「值遇餘佛」者，初文以有餘土佛名為餘佛。	Encountering other Buddhas means that in the first text, the Buddha of the land with remainder is called another Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b19_3']	「羅漢受先世身」者，酬先業故名先世身。	「羅漢受先世身」者，酬先業故名先世身。	Arhats receive their previous bodies means that because they repay their previous karma, they are called previous bodies.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b19_13']	煩惱果故，故須必滅。	煩惱果故，故須必滅。	Because they are the fruits of afflictions, they must be extinguished.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b21_14']	若煩惱所惑能不滅者，有於因果不同之過，縱云邊際定力持令不滅，今問邊定為大為少？	若煩惱所惑能不滅者，有於因果不同之過，縱云邊際定力持令不滅，今問邊定為大為少？	If what is deluded by afflictions is able not to be extinguished, there is the fault of cause and effect being different. Even if it is said that the power of the ultimate samādhi holds it and does not allow it to be extinguished, now it is asked whether the ultimate samādhi is great or small?
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b22_15']	若其小者，小無變易之名，亦無永常之說。	若其小者，小無變易之名，亦無永常之說。	If it is small, small does not have the name of changing and ending, and there is also no eternal permanence.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b24_1']	若言大者，大邊除名唯在等覺，豈得記之後即等覺耶？	若言大者，大邊除名唯在等覺，豈得記之後即等覺耶？	If it is said to be great, the name of great ultimate is only in the stage of enlightenment. How can it be said that after receiving the prediction, one is immediately enlightened?
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b24_12']	若大入小定顯大無定用。	若大入小定顯大無定用。	If the great enters the small, the samādhi manifests the great without the use of samādhi.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b25_4']	有引羅云等，此不應爾。	有引羅云等，此不應爾。	Some cite Rāhula and others, but this is not so.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b26_10']	但佛滅後諸阿羅漢隱顯不同，皆隨機緣，況本大菩薩。	但佛滅後諸阿羅漢隱顯不同，皆隨機緣，況本大菩薩。	However, after the Buddha's extinction, the arhats' concealment and manifestation were not the same, all following the conditions of beings, let alone the original great bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b27_15']	此是《大論》龍樹菩薩假施此問，欲準大教具委答之故也。	此是《大論》龍樹菩薩假施此問，欲準大教具委答之故也。	This is the question posed by Nāgârjuna Bodhisattva in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra, wanting to use the great teaching to fully explain it.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241b28_20']	故答文中云「不生三界」，況論還引《法華》證之。	故答文中云「不生三界」，況論還引《法華》證之。	Therefore, in the answer it says not born in the three realms, and the treatise still quotes the Lotus Sūtra to prove it.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241c01_1']	故知博地之言無教可準，餘國之義出自他人。	故知博地之言無教可準，餘國之義出自他人。	Therefore, we know that the words ordinary ground have no teaching to follow, and the meaning of other lands comes from others.

['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241c04_10']	又若變易不出界者，而生五道之言，却入生死之說，驚入火宅之喻，非涅槃一日之文，便為虛構。	又若變易不出界者，而生五道之言，却入生死之說，驚入火宅之喻，非涅槃一日之文，便為虛構。	Moreover, if the transformation does not leave the realm, and the words of birth in the five paths, the teachings of returning to birth and death, and the metaphor of entering the burning house in alarm, are not the texts of one day of nirvana, then they are falsely constructed.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241c05_3']	「南岳」下三釋，並是南岳釋也。	「南岳」下三釋，並是南岳釋也。	Nanyue and below are the three explanations, all of which are Nanyue's explanations.

If it is said to be mindful of the buddhas of the ten directions, then the great mind has already been aroused. If it is only mindful of Śākyamuni, then it is a small cause that gives rise to the great. This is also due to the arousal of the capacity.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0241c10_8']	然小乘之中諸部不同，亦有信有十方佛者，即小乘人修第四禪邊際定力，見十方佛等，念佛觀成感佛為說。	然小乘之中諸部不同，亦有信有十方佛者，即小乘人修第四禪邊際定力，見十方佛等，念佛觀成感佛為說。	However, among the Hīnayāna schools there are different opinions. There are those who believe in the buddhas of the ten directions. Those Hīnayāna practitioners who cultivate the power of the samādhi of the peak of existence see the buddhas of the ten directions and so on. When the contemplation of mindfulness of the Buddha is accomplished, the buddhas appear and expound the Dharma for them.

However, the nature of faculties can be mutually brought up, while the desire to enjoy must be in the present.

Or it can be said that past desire forms past nature, and present desire forms future nature. This means that although the name of desire passes through the past and future, it is still spoken from the present. Therefore, it is known that the name of desire and thought is definitely in the present.

The bodhisattvas do not say distinct because the pure mind has already been completed as the Distinct Teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_05b:0243a01_3']	既以聲聞菩薩共為義立，乃至一句皆悉成佛。	既以聲聞菩薩共為義立，乃至一句皆悉成佛。	Since the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas are jointly established as the meaning, even a single phrase is all accomplished as Buddhahood.

They are provisionally established for beings, such as the three treasures and other expedients. Now that the truth has been revealed, the removed are brought up again to show the Buddha's wisdom, which is what is listed in the previous sentence.

The term provisional generally refers to the three teachings. The words the rest and two or three simply say interpenetration, because the rest are all provisional and can interpenetrate. The rest without remainder has no more name of interpenetration, because it is pure and one. This refers to the text on milk, the two kinds of cream, and the three flavors.

The previous outline says to specifically clarify the five turbidities that obstruct the three.

Listing the names is sufficient to clarify the meaning of the turbidities. Why bother to extensively establish long chapters here, causing those on the deluded path to think that the Lotus Sūtra also clarifies the five turbidities, no different from the Abhidharma? It is like worldly people saying:

There are two interpretations, both advancing and retreating. There are also two meanings. The name of the five vehicles is only in the Deer Park, and the name of the seven expedient means is common to the three flavors.

If the bodhisattvas do not distinguish, why is it necessary to bring up the past to make the teachings one?

The meaning in the answer is the three buddha-natures. Past subtle wholesome vows and wisdom control all to head towards enlightenment. Flames heading towards emptiness naturally all extinguish. Water flowing towards the ocean naturally does not stop. It is only because of vows and wisdom not yet assisting that one seals off karmic retribution. Therefore, it awaits the present opening to be the conditional cause. If according to the intention of transformation, how does it await this opening?

It is only that sentient beings from beginningless time have only flowed into the false self, and whatever they cultivate is never not together. The statement that they do not receive retribution is established from what?🔽If it is about those who have already given rise to the mind, it is due to the attraction of vows and practices.

It should be known that for those who have already repaid, their causes have already ceased, but for those who have not repaid, even a small goodness is not lost. If one has already given rise to the aspiration, it is like water stored in the ocean. Repaying according to the cause is like a fruit repaying a flower. Therefore, now for those causes that have not yet been repaid, it opens up their limited feelings and those who have previously pursued the path of the provisional vehicle, using the path of the essence of the great vow of the one true observation. If it were not so, it would be in vain to say that it is opened. If one does not observe, then the essence of goodness should naturally reach bodhi. Why is it necessary to cultivate the practices and vows of bodhi again?

Therefore, we know that even if those of fixed nature and those who have not yet aroused the mind have wholesome roots as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, they will ultimately have no way to attain enlightenment on their own. Therefore, it is said that they are not able to attain it.
