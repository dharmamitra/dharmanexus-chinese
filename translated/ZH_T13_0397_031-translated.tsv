In order to attain penetrating understanding and know the truth, one diligently cultivates the four immeasurable minds. Because of cultivation, one attains the wisdom of exhaustion.

['ZH_T13_0397_031:0213c19_14']	惟願如來垂心憐愍說未曾聞，眾生聞是未曾聞已，度生死海摧折愛樹。	惟願如來垂心憐愍說未曾聞，眾生聞是未曾聞已，度生死海摧折愛樹。	May the Tathāgata, out of compassion, speak of what has never been heard before. When sentient beings hear what has never been heard before, they will cross the ocean of birth and death and uproot the tree of craving.

The Tathāgata is able to purify the six sense faculties of sentient beings. I earnestly wish that he will expound the pure Dharma.

Such a person will never think of the vehicle of the śrāvakas. Although they may cultivate immeasurable practices without reaching the end, they will not be afraid of regressing and falling into the stage of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.
['ZH_T13_0397_031:0213c27_15']	若諸菩薩不能修集四無量者，如是菩薩於菩提道則為有退，是名不得清淨六根，是名於法有貪有慳。	若諸菩薩不能修集四無量者，如是菩薩於菩提道則為有退，是名不得清淨六根，是名於法有貪有慳。	If bodhisattvas are unable to cultivate the four immeasurables, such bodhisattvas will then regress on the path to enlightenment. This is called not attaining the six pure faculties, and this is called having greed and stinginess towards the Dharma.
['ZH_T13_0397_031:0214a01_14']	如是名為行於他行不行自行，是名不能成就七財、不能度脫一切眾生於生死海，是故我說如是行者，即是聲聞、辟支佛行。	如是名為行於他行不行自行，是名不能成就七財、不能度脫一切眾生於生死海，是故我說如是行者，即是聲聞、辟支佛行。	This is called practicing the practices of others while not practicing one's own practice, this is called being unable to perfect the seven riches and unable to liberate all sentient beings from the ocean of birth and death. Therefore, I say that such practice is the practice of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

It is in order to enable devas and humans to attain faith. Those who have not yet given rise to the bodhi mind will give rise to the mind. Those who have already given rise to the mind will experience growth. It is in order to enable sentient beings to attain faith.
['ZH_T13_0397_031:0214a09_16']	如來若說大乘法者，無量眾生當得發起菩提之心，因得修行不共之法，成就具足法陀羅尼。	如來若說大乘法者，無量眾生當得發起菩提之心，因得修行不共之法，成就具足法陀羅尼。	If the Tathāgata expounds the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, immeasurable sentient beings will be able to give rise to the bodhi mind, and by practicing the uncommon Dharma, they will accomplish and perfect the dhāraṇī of the Dharma.
