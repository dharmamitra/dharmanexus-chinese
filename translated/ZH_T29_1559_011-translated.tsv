['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a14_17']	為如來見一日一夜後優波婆娑護不得生故，但說優波婆娑護一日一夜？	為如來見一日一夜後優波婆娑護不得生故，但說優波婆娑護一日一夜？	Is it because the Tathāgata sees that after one day and night, the upavāsa precepts cannot arise, so he only speaks of the upavāsa precepts for one day and night?
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a16_6']	為為安立難調伏根眾生，正受優波婆娑護止於一日一夜中？	為為安立難調伏根眾生，正受優波婆娑護止於一日一夜中？	Or is it to establish those with difficult-to-tame faculties, to receive the upavāsa precepts and abide in them for one day and night?
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a16_14']	如此事云何可思？	如此事云何可思？	How can this matter be considered?

['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a19_1']	此事後不曾見如來為一人說故，毘婆沙師非如來所說則不敢說。	此事後不曾見如來為一人說故，毘婆沙師非如來所說則不敢說。	This matter has never been seen by the Tathāgata for the sake of one person, so the Vaibhāṣikas do not dare to speak of what is not spoken by the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a19_9']	不護決定時云何？	不護決定時云何？	How is the duration of non-restraint determined?

['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a19_18']	無日夜不護。	無日夜不護。	There is no non-restraint for a day and night.
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a20_1']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The explanation states:
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a21_13']	由此人樂一期作惡業，是故不護生，不得止一日一夜，不如優波婆娑護。	由此人樂一期作惡業，是故不護生，不得止一日一夜，不如優波婆娑護。	Because this person delights in committing evil karma for a period of time, therefore non-restraint arises and cannot be limited to one day and night, unlike the upavāsa precepts.
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a21_17']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a22_1']	如彼執。	如彼執。	Because it is grasped in this way.

['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a22_10']	由不受如此。	由不受如此。	Because it is not accepted in this way.
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a22_13']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The Sautrāntikas say:
['ZH_T29_1559_011:0232a24_1']	無人受不護，如受優波婆娑護，願我一日一夜中受持不護。	無人受不護，如受優波婆娑護，願我一日一夜中受持不護。	There is no one who accepts non-restraint, just as there is no one who accepts the upavāsa precepts and says, I will observe non-restraint for one day and one night.
