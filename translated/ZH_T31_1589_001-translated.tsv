They say this is not nonexistent.

It is the retribution of action, but you do not admit that it is born in the place where it is perfumed. You admit that the result of action is born in a place other than where it is perfumed. What reason do you have for this kind of theory?
['ZH_T31_1589_001:0071c07_11']	阿含是因。	阿含是因。	The reason is the scriptures.

These seeds and the manifestation as if it were touch are the means for the arising of the consciousness of touch. Therefore, the Buddha, the World-Honored One, teaches them as the sense base of the body and the sense base of touch.
