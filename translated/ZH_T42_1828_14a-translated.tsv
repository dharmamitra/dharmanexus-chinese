['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615b24_5']	謂從三性意思變起色聲為身語業體。	謂從三性意思變起色聲為身語業體。	14a	it refers to the body and speech karmas that arise from the mind of the three natures and take form and sound as their essence.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615b25_5']	彼意業者取根本身語同時意思是意業體。	彼意業者取根本身語同時意思是意業體。	14a	As for the mental karma, it takes the thought that simultaneously arises with the fundamental body and speech karmas as its essence.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615b25_15']	若遣相分就見分出體。	若遣相分就見分出體。	14a	If the essence is distinguished according to the seeing part, disregarding the characteristics,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615b26_12']	即取根本意思依身語門名身語表業。	即取根本意思依身語門名身語表業。	14a	The fundamental volition that takes them as its object is called bodily and verbal manifest karma.

['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c14_11']	今言身語表業從能表示身語為名。	今言身語表業從能表示身語為名。	14a	Now, the bodily and verbal expressed karma is named after the body and speech that can express.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c15_6']	意表業者則從相應了境為因。	意表業者則從相應了境為因。	14a	As for mental expressed karma, it is based on the cause of corresponding understanding of the object.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c15_11']	無表業者。	無表業者。	14a	As for the unmanifested karma,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c15_16']	有其二義。	有其二義。	14a	there are two meanings.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c17_1']	一就現起身語隨其善惡以相表示當性自表名為表業。	一就現起身語隨其善惡以相表示當性自表名為表業。	14a	First, in terms of the body and speech that arise in the present, according to their goodness or evil, they are mutually indicated and naturally manifest themselves, which is called manifest karma.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c17_14']	若望異性不能相表亦名無表。	若望異性不能相表亦名無表。	14a	If it is compared with different natures, it cannot mutually indicate, and it is also called non-manifest.

['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c21_4']	此中但說有表業。	此中但說有表業。	14a	Here, it only speaks of manifest karma.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c21_18']	略無無表道理必有以有種子故。	略無無表道理必有以有種子故。	14a	It briefly lacks non-manifest, but the principle must exist because there are seeds.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c22_4']	意表業者。	意表業者。	14a	As for mental manifest karma,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c23_2']	若望表了自境名為表業即功能為號。	若望表了自境名為表業即功能為號。	14a	if it is compared with manifesting and understanding its own object, it is called manifest karma, which is named based on its function.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c24_9']	善惡性異善不代惡有所表了惡不代善有所表了亦稱無表。	善惡性異善不代惡有所表了惡不代善有所表了亦稱無表。	14a	The natures of good and evil are different. Good does not replace evil and has something to manifest and understand. Evil does not replace good and has something to manifest and understand, and it is also called non-manifest.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c24_16']	若就種子立意。	若就種子立意。	14a	If it is established based on the seeds of the mind,

['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c27_3']	此準此卷下解虛空等二無為已。	此準此卷下解虛空等二無為已。	14a	This is based on the explanation of the two unconditioned dharmas such as space in the latter part of this fascicle.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c28_2']	結云如是二十四不相應法等皆是假有。	結云如是二十四不相應法等皆是假有。	14a	It concludes by saying that these twenty-four dharmas not directly perceived are all provisionally existent.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c28_16']	看文勢則兼結前第五十二已來。	看文勢則兼結前第五十二已來。	14a	Looking at the text, it also includes the previous fifty-two.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c29_7']	前卷末種子及此業等。	前卷末種子及此業等。	14a	The seeds at the end of the previous fascicle and these karmas,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0615c29_12']	皆是伏難。	皆是伏難。	14a	are all refuting difficulties.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a01_3']	謂前不相應證成假有。	謂前不相應證成假有。	14a	It is said that the dharmas not directly perceived are established as provisionally existent.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a01_12']	前言種子為假為實。	前言種子為假為實。	14a	It is said that the seeds are either provisional or real.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a02_1']	既明種子假實已。	既明種子假實已。	14a	Since the reality of the seeds has already been clarified,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a02_10']	業於種子上立明之。	業於種子上立明之。	14a	the karmas are established on top of the seeds.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a03_4']	設假現立種子已前不相應未盡。	設假現立種子已前不相應未盡。	14a	Even if the provisional is established before the seeds, the dharmas not directly perceived are not exhausted.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a03_17']	故於種子上而建立無想定等。	故於種子上而建立無想定等。	14a	Therefore, the non-perception concentration and so forth are established on top of the seeds.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a04_11']	故業下明無想定等三不相應。	故業下明無想定等三不相應。	14a	Therefore, below the karmas, the three dharmas not directly perceived such as the non-perception concentration are explained.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a05_4']	便決擇本扐八卷業道義。	便決擇本扐八卷業道義。	14a	It then decides the meaning of the eight fascicle karmic path that was originally grasped.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a05_14']	彼是尋伺地此是意地。	彼是尋伺地此是意地。	14a	That is the stage of investigation and deliberation, this is the stage of the mind.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a06_1']	故非正決擇。	故非正決擇。	14a	Therefore, it is not a correct discernment.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a06_15']	言若於身語意十不善業道等者。	言若於身語意十不善業道等者。	14a	As for if one engages in the ten unwholesome courses of action of body, speech, and mind,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a06_18']	景云。	景云。	14a	Jingyun says:
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a07_5']	前七亦業亦道。	前七亦業亦道。	14a	The first seven are both actions and paths.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a07_16']	後三貪瞋邪見道而非業。	後三貪瞋邪見道而非業。	14a	The last three are paths but not actions.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a08_14']	何故今言身語意三業名十不善業道耶。	何故今言身語意三業名十不善業道耶。	14a	Why is it said now that the three actions of body, speech, and mind are called the ten unwholesome courses of action?
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a08_17']	解云。	解云。	14a	The explanation is:
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a09_14']	今據意業與貪瞋邪見同時相應為言。	今據意業與貪瞋邪見同時相應為言。	14a	Now, based on the mental action and the simultaneous association with greed, anger, and wrong views, it is said.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a10_7']	故言身語意十不善業道。	故言身語意十不善業道。	14a	Therefore, it is said that the ten unwholesome courses of action of body, speech, and mind.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a10_16']	道理意思非後三道。	道理意思非後三道。	14a	In principle, mental volition is not the last three paths.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a11_7']	以意思業業而非道故。	以意思業業而非道故。	14a	This is because mental volition is an action but not a path.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a11_11']	不離者。	不離者。	14a	As for not separated from,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a12_2']	是業種子者隨不離也。	是業種子者隨不離也。	14a	it refers to the seeds of action that are not separated.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a12_11']	現行增上力故等者。	現行增上力故等者。	14a	As for by the power of the dominant condition of the present activity,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a13_5']	由此種子望彼現行增上力故。	由此種子望彼現行增上力故。	14a	it is because, with respect to those present activities, these seeds have the power of the dominant condition.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a13_16']	生起所有身語染污表業。	生起所有身語染污表業。	14a	All the defiled bodily and verbal manifest actions that arise
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a13_19']	備云。	備云。	14a	Biyun says:
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a14_7']	未離聖道所對治。	未離聖道所對治。	14a	Because one has not yet separated from what is to be eliminated by the path of the noble ones,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a14_12']	故言不離。	故言不離。	14a	it is said to be not separated from.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a14_17']	今解稍異。	今解稍異。	14a	The current explanation is slightly different.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a15_11']	以下明善業中云於彼誓受遠離。	以下明善業中云於彼誓受遠離。	14a	Below, it clarifies the wholesome actions, saying to vow to abstain from them.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a16_2']	故知此云不離現行。	故知此云不離現行。	14a	Therefore, it is known that this refers to not abandoning current activities.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a16_11']	即不遠離十不善也。	即不遠離十不善也。	14a	It is precisely not abstaining from the ten unwholesome [actions].
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a17_3']	若即於彼至名善表業者。	若即於彼至名善表業者。	14a	If, in that very place, up to it is called the bodily and verbal manifest karma of good,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a17_6']	景云。	景云。	14a	Jing says:
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a17_17']	既言誓受遠離身語表業。	既言誓受遠離身語表業。	14a	Since it is said that one vows to abstain from bodily and verbal manifest karma,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a18_8']	是即未起身語但有思願。	是即未起身語但有思願。	14a	this is precisely not yet giving rise to body and speech, but only having intention and aspiration.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a18_17']	云何得名身語表業。	云何得名身語表業。	14a	How can it be called bodily and verbal manifest karma?
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a19_1']	解云。	解云。	14a	The explanation says:
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a19_6']	若據作善。	若據作善。	14a	If one is speaking of doing good,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a19_15']	爾時即無身語二業。	爾時即無身語二業。	14a	at that time there is no bodily or verbal karma.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a19_20']	若據止善。	若據止善。	14a	If one is speaking of abstaining from evil,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a20_4']	爾時即有。	爾時即有。	14a	at that time there is [abstaining karma].
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a20_9']	以誓受時。	以誓受時。	14a	Because at the time of vowing,
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a21_3']	於一意思有離身語七非義故。	於一意思有離身語七非義故。	14a	within a single thought there is the meaning of abstaining from the seven non-virtues of body and speech.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a21_13']	名此意思為身語善業。	名此意思為身語善業。	14a	This thought is called the good karma of body and speech.
['ZH_T42_1828_14a:0616a21_18']	故無有過。	故無有過。	14a	Therefore there is no fault.
