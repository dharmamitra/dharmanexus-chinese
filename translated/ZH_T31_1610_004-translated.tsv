['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c07_18']	離有六義，合則成三。	離有六義，合則成三。	004	When separated, there are six meanings, which combined form three.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c09_20']	離有六種者，一無前後際變異、二無染淨異、三無生異、四無轉異、五無依住異、六無滅異。	離有六種者，一無前後際變異、二無染淨異、三無生異、四無轉異、五無依住異、六無滅異。	004	As for the six kinds when separated, they are: 1) no change in the past and future, 2) no difference between defilement and purity, 3) no difference in arising, 4) no difference in transformation, 5) no difference in dependence and abiding, and 6) no difference in cessation.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c11_5']	言無前後際變異者，如佛為海智菩薩說《解節經》偈言：	言無前後際變異者，如佛為海智菩薩說《解節經》偈言：	004	As for no change in the past and future, as the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Ocean Wisdom in the Sutra of Unraveling the Knots, in a verse:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c12_0']	「客塵相應故，　　有自性德故，	「客塵相應故，　　有自性德故，	004	Because of the characteristics of guest and dust, and because of having the nature of virtues,
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c13_13']	如前後亦爾，　　是無變異相。	如前後亦爾，　　是無變異相。	004	As before, so after, this is the characteristic of the unchanging.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c15_2']	」復次釋不淨位中，有九種客塵，非所染污故不淨；	」復次釋不淨位中，有九種客塵，非所染污故不淨；	004	Next, in the impure stage, there are nine kinds of guest dust that are not defiled, so it is impure;
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c16_17']	淨位中，常樂我淨四德及如來恒沙功德，恒相應故，故說如來性前後無變異。	淨位中，常樂我淨四德及如來恒沙功德，恒相應故，故說如來性前後無變異。	004	In the pure state, the four virtues of purity, bliss, self, and purity, as well as the innumerable merits of the Tathāgata, are always in accord, and therefore it is said that the nature of the Tathāgata does not change before and after.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c17_12']	若略說一切煩惱客塵，凡有九種：	若略說一切煩惱客塵，凡有九種：	004	If one speaks briefly, there are nine kinds of afflictions and guest-dust:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c20_11']	一者隨眠貪欲煩惱、二隨眠瞋、三隨眠癡、四貪瞋癡等極重上心惑、五無明住地、六見諦所滅、七修習所滅、八不淨地、九淨地惑。	一者隨眠貪欲煩惱、二隨眠瞋、三隨眠癡、四貪瞋癡等極重上心惑、五無明住地、六見諦所滅、七修習所滅、八不淨地、九淨地惑。	004	First, the afflictions of latent afflictive desire; second, latent afflictive anger; third, latent afflictive delusion; fourth, the most severe upper-level afflictions of desire, anger, and delusion; fifth, the ground of ignorance; sixth, those eliminated by seeing the truth; seventh, those eliminated by cultivation; eighth, the impure grounds; ninth, the pure ground afflictions.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c23_4']	若煩惱在世間離欲眾生相續中，為不動業增長家因，能生色無色界，為出世無分別智所滅，是名隨眠欲瞋癡等三毒。	若煩惱在世間離欲眾生相續中，為不動業增長家因，能生色無色界，為出世無分別智所滅，是名隨眠欲瞋癡等三毒。	004	If afflictions exist in the continuum of beings who have left the desire realm in the world, they are the causes that increase and grow into immovable karma, able to give rise to the form and formless realms, and are eliminated by supramundane non-discriminating cognition. These are called the three poisons of latent afflictive desire, anger, and delusion.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c23_7']	釋曰：	釋曰：	004	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c23_16']	言煩惱在者，有二：	言煩惱在者，有二：	004	There are two kinds of afflictions that exist:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c24_12']	一有體說在、二無體，約因在故說在。	一有體說在、二無體，約因在故說在。	004	First, those that exist with substance; second, those that exist without substance, but are said to exist because their causes exist.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c25_1']	言體在者，即見諦。	言體在者，即見諦。	004	The substance remains refers to the views of the realm of desire.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c25_12']	隨眠未得治道，故言在。	隨眠未得治道，故言在。	004	The latent afflictions have not yet attained the path of elimination, so it is said that they remain.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c26_8']	約因在者，即思惟隨眠，已得治道故。	約因在者，即思惟隨眠，已得治道故。	004	As for the cause remaining, it refers to the latent afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm. Since the path of elimination has already been attained,
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c27_16']	以思惟用見諦為因，思惟雖滅，由有見諦為思惟因，故言因在。	以思惟用見諦為因，思惟雖滅，由有見諦為思惟因，故言因在。	004	the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm use the views of the realm of desire as their cause. Even though the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm have been eliminated, because there are still the views of the realm of desire as the cause of the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm, it is said that the cause remains.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0806c29_15']	思惟必由見諦而生，若除思惟因，有根本見諦惑在，後更能生思惟之惑，故言思惟因在。	思惟必由見諦而生，若除思惟因，有根本見諦惑在，後更能生思惟之惑，故言思惟因在。	004	The afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm must arise based on the views of the realm of desire. If the cause of the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm is removed, and there are still the fundamental afflictions of the realm of desire, they will be able to give rise to the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm again in the future. Therefore, it is said that the cause of the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm remains.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a01_19']	不動業增長家因者，一思惟能成業、二見諦能得果。	不動業增長家因者，一思惟能成業、二見諦能得果。	004	As for the cause of the increase of immovable karma, the first is that the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm can accomplish karma, and the second is that the views of the realm of desire can obtain results.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a02_3']	何以故？	何以故？	004	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a02_13']	斷思惟盡，業不成故。	斷思惟盡，業不成故。	004	Because if the afflictions of the realm of form and the formless realm are completely eliminated, karma cannot be accomplished.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a03_8']	斷見諦盡，不感果故，故說不動業。	斷見諦盡，不感果故，故說不動業。	004	Because if the views of the realm of desire are completely eliminated, they cannot give rise to results. Therefore, it is said to be immovable karma.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a04_18']	為增長家因，能生色無色界故，為出世無分別智所滅者，有二種滅：	為增長家因，能生色無色界故，為出世無分別智所滅者，有二種滅：	004	As for the cause of increase, it can give rise to the form realm and the formless realm. As for what is eliminated by supramundane non-discriminating cognition, there are two kinds of elimination:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a05_8']	一者性滅、二治道滅。	一者性滅、二治道滅。	004	First, natural cessation; second, cessation through the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a06_4']	一性滅者有二，謂念念滅及相違滅。	一性滅者有二，謂念念滅及相違滅。	004	First, natural cessation is of two kinds: moment-to-moment cessation and cessation through mutual exclusion.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a07_4']	相違滅又有二種，一等類相違，如貪違瞋等；	相違滅又有二種，一等類相違，如貪違瞋等；	004	Cessation through mutual exclusion is also of two kinds: 1. Mutual exclusion of the same class, such as greed excluding hatred, etc.;
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a08_6']	二不等類相違，如正思惟違欲瞋等，是名性滅。	二不等類相違，如正思惟違欲瞋等，是名性滅。	004	2. Mutual exclusion of different classes, such as right thought excluding desire, hatred, etc. This is called natural cessation.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a08_16']	二治道滅者，有二種：	二治道滅者，有二種：	004	Second, cessation through the path of cultivation is of two kinds:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a09_1']	一通、二別。	一通、二別。	004	1. Universal; 2. Specific.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a09_16']	通道者，謂觀真如，滅三界煩惱。	通道者，謂觀真如，滅三界煩惱。	004	The universal path refers to the contemplation of suchness, which eliminates the afflictions of the three realms.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a11_19']	二別道者，如不淨觀等能滅貪瞋等煩惱，如苦諦觀滅苦諦惑、不滅集諦惑故，名隨眠欲瞋癡等。	二別道者，如不淨觀等能滅貪瞋等煩惱，如苦諦觀滅苦諦惑、不滅集諦惑故，名隨眠欲瞋癡等。	004	The specific path is of two kinds: 1. The contemplation of impurity, etc., which can eliminate the afflictions of greed, hatred, etc.; 2. The contemplation of the truth of suffering, which eliminates the delusions regarding the truth of suffering but does not eliminate the delusions regarding the truth of accumulation. Therefore, it is called the latent tendencies of desire, hatred, and delusion, etc.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a14_18']	四三毒極重上心惑者，有諸煩惱在欲行眾生相續中，為罪福兩行增長家因，但生欲界，修不淨觀等所破，是名貪瞋癡極重上心煩惱。	四三毒極重上心惑者，有諸煩惱在欲行眾生相續中，為罪福兩行增長家因，但生欲界，修不淨觀等所破，是名貪瞋癡極重上心煩惱。	004	Fourth, the most severe upper-level afflictions of the three poisons: there are various afflictions in the mental continuum of beings in the desire realm, which serve as the causes for the increase of both wholesome and unwholesome actions, only giving rise to the desire realm. They are eliminated by cultivating the contemplation of impurity and so forth. These are called the most severe upper-level afflictions of greed, hatred, and delusion.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a18_4']	五無明住地惑者，在阿羅漢相續中，為無流業生家因，能生意所生身，為如來菩提所破，是名無明住地惑，故阿羅漢約安立諦觀能破諸煩惱。	五無明住地惑者，在阿羅漢相續中，為無流業生家因，能生意所生身，為如來菩提所破，是名無明住地惑，故阿羅漢約安立諦觀能破諸煩惱。	004	Fifth, the afflictions of the stage of ignorance: in the mental continuum of arhats, they serve as the causes for the arising of uncontaminated karma, and can give rise to the body produced by intention. They are eliminated by the enlightenment of the Tathāgata. These are called the afflictions of the stage of ignorance. Therefore, arhats can eliminate various afflictions through the contemplation of the established truths.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a19_17']	此無明住地，非安立諦觀所能破故，猶在羅漢相續中，為無流業生家因。	此無明住地，非安立諦觀所能破故，猶在羅漢相續中，為無流業生家因。	004	These afflictions of the stage of ignorance cannot be eliminated by the contemplation of the non-established truths, and thus still exist in the mental continuum of arhats, serving as the causes for the arising of uncontaminated karma.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a20_10']	無流業生家因者，流有三義：	無流業生家因者，流有三義：	004	As for the causes for the arising of uncontaminated karma, there are three meanings of flowing:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a20_19']	一者流入三界生死。	一者流入三界生死。	004	First, flowing into the birth and death of the three realms.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a22_16']	二者退失，如失欲界流往色界，或失色界流下欲界，則隨生死不定一處故名為流。	二者退失，如失欲界流往色界，或失色界流下欲界，則隨生死不定一處故名為流。	004	Second, regression, like losing the desire realm and flowing to the form realm, or losing the form realm and flowing down to the desire realm, then following birth and death, not fixed in one place, is called flowing.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a24_1']	三者流脫功德善根失戒定慧，譬如破塘水則不住。	三者流脫功德善根失戒定慧，譬如破塘水則不住。	004	Third, flowing and escaping, losing the merit and wholesome roots of virtue, like breaking a dike and water not staying.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a24_11']	無此三流，故名無流。	無此三流，故名無流。	004	Lacking these three flows, it is called without flow.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a25_7']	業者，作意為義，此意業能生四種生死。	業者，作意為義，此意業能生四種生死。	004	As for karma, it means intention. This intentional karma can give rise to four kinds of birth and death.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a26_12']	如來菩提破者，如來菩提非安立諦觀，是名如來菩提。	如來菩提破者，如來菩提非安立諦觀，是名如來菩提。	004	The enlightenment of the Tathāgata destroys it. The enlightenment of the Tathāgata is the observation of the truth of non-establishment. This is called the enlightenment of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a27_9']	因此道故，能滅此惑故，名無明住地。	因此道故，能滅此惑故，名無明住地。	004	Because of this path, it can extinguish this delusion, and is called the ground of ignorance.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a28_3']	六見諦所滅惑者，有二種學人：	六見諦所滅惑者，有二種學人：	004	As for the six delusions that are extinguished by seeing the truth, there are two kinds of learners:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807a28_11']	一凡夫、二聖人。	一凡夫、二聖人。	004	First, ordinary beings, second, noble ones.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b01_6']	此惑在學道凡夫相續中，無始已來未曾見理，因初出世聖道所破，名為見諦。	此惑在學道凡夫相續中，無始已來未曾見理，因初出世聖道所破，名為見諦。	004	These delusions are in the continuity of ordinary beings on the path of learning. From beginningless time, they have never seen the truth. They are destroyed by the supramundane path that first appears in the world, and are called those extinguished by seeing the truth.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b01_9']	釋曰：	釋曰：	004	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b03_12']	學道凡夫相續中者，若小乘則從煖、頂、忍、世法，此四是學道凡夫位，見諦隨眠其未能滅，故言在中。	學道凡夫相續中者，若小乘則從煖、頂、忍、世法，此四是學道凡夫位，見諦隨眠其未能滅，故言在中。	004	As for those in the continuum of ordinary beings who study the Way, if they are of the Lesser Vehicle, they are from the stages of heat, summit, patience, and worldly dharmas. These four are the stage of ordinary beings who study the Way. The latent afflictions of the path of seeing have not yet been extinguished, so it is said that they are in the middle.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b05_8']	無始時節未見者，從無始以來迄至此道所未曾見安立聖諦，故言未曾得見。	無始時節未見者，從無始以來迄至此道所未曾見安立聖諦，故言未曾得見。	004	As for those who have not seen since beginningless time, from beginningless time up to this stage of the Way, they have never seen the establishment of the noble truths, so it is said that they have never attained insight.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b06_17']	初出世聖道所破者，始自苦法忍初念之道，能破煩惱，名為見諦。	初出世聖道所破者，始自苦法忍初念之道，能破煩惱，名為見諦。	004	As for what is destroyed by the supramundane noble path that first appears, the path that first appears in the initial moment of the patience of the dharma of suffering is able to destroy afflictions, which is called seeing the truths.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b07_6']	自此後去並屬思惟。	自此後去並屬思惟。	004	From here onward, it all belongs to contemplation.

['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b09_6']	若利根人，於一念中則等觀四諦，八十八惑一時俱斷，皆名見諦。	若利根人，於一念中則等觀四諦，八十八惑一時俱斷，皆名見諦。	004	If one has sharp faculties, in a single moment one equally contemplates the four truths, and the eighty-eight delusions are simultaneously severed, all of which are called seeing the truths.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b11_16']	若鈍根人，於次第觀者，則初念觀苦、不見餘三諦，但斷苦下四諦，名為見諦，餘未斷者皆屬思惟，是名見諦所滅惑。	若鈍根人，於次第觀者，則初念觀苦、不見餘三諦，但斷苦下四諦，名為見諦，餘未斷者皆屬思惟，是名見諦所滅惑。	004	If a person of dull faculties observes in sequence, then in the first moment they observe suffering and do not see the other three truths, but only eliminate the four truths below suffering, which is called seeing the truths. The rest that have not yet been eliminated are all categorized as contemplation. These are called delusions that are eliminated by seeing the truths.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b12_7']	若大乘則十信等諸位。	若大乘則十信等諸位。	004	If it is the Great Vehicle, then it is the various stages such as the ten faiths and so forth.

['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b14_14']	七修道所滅惑者，在學道聖人相續中，昔已曾見出世聖道所破，是名由修道所滅惑。	七修道所滅惑者，在學道聖人相續中，昔已曾見出世聖道所破，是名由修道所滅惑。	004	The seventh, delusions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation, are those that are to be destroyed by the supramundane path that has already been seen in the continuum of sages in the path of learning. These are called delusions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation.

['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b16_18']	釋曰：	釋曰：	004	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b17_9']	七地者，即前七地已還故。	七地者，即前七地已還故。	004	The seven grounds are the first seven grounds and below.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b18_3']	無相無功用道者，即八地以上。	無相無功用道者，即八地以上。	004	The path of signlessness and effortless activity is the eighth ground and above.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b18_12']	無相者，即真如境。	無相者，即真如境。	004	Signlessness refers to the realm of suchness.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b19_3']	無功用者，即自然昇進道。	無功用者，即自然昇進道。	004	The effortless one is the path of spontaneous advancement.

['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b22_13']	言究竟者，八地以上見境皆周，無更別境所未見者，故名究竟。	言究竟者，八地以上見境皆周，無更別境所未見者，故名究竟。	004	As for ultimate, above the eighth stage, the seen realm is all-encompassing, and there is no separate realm that has not been seen, thus it is called ultimate.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0807b23_18']	但方便由有淺深故、諸地為別故，分別煩惱有此九種。	但方便由有淺深故、諸地為別故，分別煩惱有此九種。	004	But because the skillful means have shallow and deep aspects, and because the stages are distinguished, the afflictions are divided into these nine types.

The essence of all buddhas is the Dharma they have attained for themselves.

['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808a26_14']	一正得法身者，體是真如。	一正得法身者，體是真如。	004	First, the one who correctly attains the Dharma body takes true suchness as its essence.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808a27_13']	世間無物可為譬者，故還取花中佛像為譬。	世間無物可為譬者，故還取花中佛像為譬。	004	Since there is no object in the world that can serve as a metaphor, it still takes the Buddha image in the flower as a metaphor.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808a28_18']	二正說深妙法身者，以真如一味故，故取蜂家蜜為譬。	二正說深妙法身者，以真如一味故，故取蜂家蜜為譬。	004	Second, the one who correctly expounds the profound and wondrous Dharma body takes the honey in the beehive as a metaphor because the one flavor of true suchness is used.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b01_6']	三麁淺正說法身者，以顯真俗種種義味故，故取糠中米為譬。	三麁淺正說法身者，以顯真俗種種義味故，故取糠中米為譬。	004	Third, the one who correctly expounds the coarse and shallow Dharma body takes the rice in the chaff as a metaphor because it reveals the various meanings and flavors of the real and conventional.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b02_4']	由此三譬，顯諸佛正得法身、正說法身。	由此三譬，顯諸佛正得法身、正說法身。	004	Because of these three metaphors, it shows that the Buddhas correctly attain the Dharma body and correctly expound the Dharma body.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b04_10']	是三法身遍滿攝藏一切眾生界無餘故，故經說無一眾生出如來法身外者，如無一色出虛空外者故。	是三法身遍滿攝藏一切眾生界無餘故，故經說無一眾生出如來法身外者，如無一色出虛空外者故。	004	Because these three Dharma bodies pervade and contain all the realms of sentient beings without exception, the sūtra says that there is not a single sentient being outside the Tathāgata's Dharma body, just as there is not a single color outside of space.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b05_16']	次金墮不淨一譬譬如如者，如如有三義，故取金為譬。	次金墮不淨一譬譬如如者，如如有三義，故取金為譬。	004	Next, the one metaphor of gold falling into impurity illustrates suchness. Since suchness has three meanings, gold is taken as a metaphor.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b06_17']	一者性無變異、二者功德無窮、三者清淨無二。	一者性無變異、二者功德無窮、三者清淨無二。	004	First, the nature is unchanging; second, the merits are inexhaustible; third, the purity is non-dual.

['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b07_17']	功德亦如，無增減故；	功德亦如，無增減故；	004	The merits are also thus, because there is no increase or decrease;
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b08_14']	清淨亦如，無染污故，故曰如如是真如。	清淨亦如，無染污故，故曰如如是真如。	004	The purity is also thus, because it is undefiled. Therefore, it is called thusness, which is suchness.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b11_10']	如在一切邪定聚及一闡提諸眾生中本無差別，若至客塵滅後說名如來藏，故說一切眾生為如來藏，能藏如來不得顯現。	如在一切邪定聚及一闡提諸眾生中本無差別，若至客塵滅後說名如來藏，故說一切眾生為如來藏，能藏如來不得顯現。	004	Thusness is originally without distinction in all those in the group of wrong determination and in all icchantikas. If the adventitious dust is extinguished, it is then called the tathāgatagarbha. Therefore, it is said that all sentient beings are the tathāgatagarbha, because the tathāgata is concealed and does not manifest.

['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b15_2']	是自性清淨與眾生清淨無有二故，為顯此如故說金寶譬。	是自性清淨與眾生清淨無有二故，為顯此如故說金寶譬。	004	Because this intrinsic nature of purity and the purity of sentient beings are non-dual, in order to reveal this thusness, the gold and treasure analogy is spoken.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b15_15']	後五譬佛性者，佛性有二種：	後五譬佛性者，佛性有二種：	004	As for the latter five parables of buddha-nature, buddha-nature is of two kinds:
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b17_2']	一者住自性性、二者引出性，諸佛三身因此二性故得成就。	一者住自性性、二者引出性，諸佛三身因此二性故得成就。	004	The first is the nature that abides in its own essence, and the second is the nature that leads to emergence. The three bodies of all buddhas are accomplished based on these two natures.
['ZH_T31_1610_004:0808b17_16']	為顯住自性故，說地中寶藏譬。	為顯住自性故，說地中寶藏譬。	004	In order to reveal the nature that abides in its own essence, the parable of the treasure in the ground is given.

It is not a matter of attaining emptiness only after the cessation of dharmas. Therefore, one should not fear the nature of emptiness.

This is grasping the imagined nature based on the dependent nature, and within it, taking real suffering to exist and giving rise to fear.
