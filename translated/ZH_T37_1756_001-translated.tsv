Those who accord with it will certainly attain the same fundamental enlightenment, while those who are transformed may differ in their practices. Therefore, Amitābha Buddha, the Enlightened One, abides in the wondrous land to spread the Way, while Śākyamuni Buddha, the Compassionate One, dwells in the defiled world to guide sentient beings. In the Pure Land, those with superior faculties are easily disciplined, while in the defiled world, the stubborn are difficult to transform. By revealing the three causes, sentient beings are guided to transcend the four forms of birth; by establishing the nine grades of rebirth, the five kinds of suffering are eliminated.
['ZH_T37_1756_001:0307c02_9']	六方諸佛現於三千，證得往生，言無虛妄，緣眾生空而不捨大悲，觀如來寂而不失敬養。	六方諸佛現於三千，證得往生，言無虛妄，緣眾生空而不捨大悲，觀如來寂而不失敬養。	The Buddhas of the six directions appear in the three thousand worlds, testifying to the attainment of rebirth, saying that it is not false. They contemplate sentient beings as empty but do not abandon great compassion, and regard the Tathāgata as tranquil but do not lose respect and reverence.
['ZH_T37_1756_001:0307c04_14']	雖知佛□□寂如空而現種種清淨佛土，可謂不壞假名而說諸法實相，不動□□而建立諸法者。	雖知佛□□寂如空而現種種清淨佛土，可謂不壞假名而說諸法實相，不動□□而建立諸法者。	Although they know that the Buddha's realm is tranquil like empty space, they manifest various pure buddha lands. It can be said that without destroying provisional names, they explain the true characteristics of all dharmas, and without moving from the realm of quiescence, they establish all dharmas.

['ZH_T37_1756_001:0307c10_4']	阿彌陀，此云無量壽，光明、說法、徒眾皆悉無量，為引物情，偏標壽名，故名無量。	阿彌陀，此云無量壽，光明、說法、徒眾皆悉無量，為引物情，偏標壽名，故名無量。	Amitâbha means immeasurable life. His light, Dharma, and assembly are all immeasurable. In order to attract people's feelings, he specifically takes the name of life, therefore called immeasurable.
['ZH_T37_1756_001:0307c11_18']	經有二義，訓經、訓常，眾聖所遊，曰經古經今，恒定曰常，故名佛說阿彌陀經。	經有二義，訓經、訓常，眾聖所遊，曰經古經今，恒定曰常，故名佛說阿彌陀經。	The sutra has two meanings: it is interpreted as sutra and constant. It is the place where the sages roam, called sutra. From ancient times to the present, it is eternally fixed, called constant. Therefore, it is called the Sutra on Amitāyus Spoken by the Buddha.

['ZH_T37_1756_001:0307c21_19']	「如是」者，信順之辭，信則所言之理順，順則師資之道成，經無豐約非信不傳，故名如是。	「如是」者，信順之辭，信則所言之理順，順則師資之道成，經無豐約非信不傳，故名如是。	Thus is a word of faith and compliance. If one has faith, then the principles spoken of are in accord. If they are in accord, then the way of teacher and disciple is accomplished. The sūtra is neither extensive nor concise, and is not transmitted without faith. Therefore, it is called thus.
['ZH_T37_1756_001:0307c23_8']	又如則指法，是則定辭，如佛所說一切皆是，故名如是，故如是。	又如則指法，是則定辭，如佛所說一切皆是，故名如是，故如是。	Moreover, thus refers to the Dharma, and is is a definitive statement. All that the Buddha spoke is indeed so. Therefore, it is called thus.

The text below says that the Buddhas of the six directions, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, manifest their forms to testify and affirm the thought of Amitābha Buddha, and one will definitely be born in the Pure Land.
['ZH_T37_1756_001:0307c27_9']	經初如是示信，經後歡喜示智，信為能入，智為能度，進念定三，網羅始終，五根具足，堪受堪傳，故云如是。	經初如是示信，經後歡喜示智，信為能入，智為能度，進念定三，網羅始終，五根具足，堪受堪傳，故云如是。	At the beginning of the sūtra, thus shows faith, and at the end of the sūtra, rejoicing shows wisdom. Faith is the means of entry, and wisdom is the means of crossing over. The three of progress, thought, and concentration net the beginning and end. With the five faculties complete, one is able to receive and transmit. Therefore, it is called thus.

This means that Ananda personally heard the Buddha speak of Amitabha Buddha's Land of Ultimate Bliss, and that if one single-mindedly contemplates it, one will definitely attain rebirth, without the errors of hearsay.
['ZH_T37_1756_001:0308a03_5']	阿難未為侍者前非親承，而言我聞者，佛臨涅槃時，更為略說，故得稱我聞也。	阿難未為侍者前非親承，而言我聞者，佛臨涅槃時，更為略說，故得稱我聞也。	Before Ananda became the attendant, he did not personally receive [the teachings]. To say I have heard means that when the Buddha was about to enter Nirvana, he briefly taught it again, so he could say I have heard.
['ZH_T37_1756_001:0308a03_15']	「一時」者，時成也。	「一時」者，時成也。	At one time means the time is complete.

When one possesses these three, one is called a Buddha.

The garden is the place of dependence, in order to receive the monastic assembly.

['ZH_T37_1756_001:0308a20_7']	人有上下，不可先稱獨園，園總樹別，不可俱言祇樹，二人同心共造精舍，含為名，故云祇樹給孤獨園。	人有上下，不可先稱獨園，園總樹別，不可俱言祇樹，二人同心共造精舍，含為名，故云祇樹給孤獨園。	People have superiors and inferiors, one cannot first call it a garden, the garden is general and the trees are specific, one cannot say both Jeta Grove and garden.
