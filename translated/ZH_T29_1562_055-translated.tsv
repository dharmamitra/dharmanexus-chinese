At that time, the passions are in accord with indifference. Therefore they are all associated with the feeling of indifference.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0647c25_17']	豈不捨根非歡非慼，如何歡慼煩惱相應？	豈不捨根非歡非慼，如何歡慼煩惱相應？	How can the feeling of indifference, which is neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction, be associated with the passions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction?

Therefore there is no error in saying that the feeling of indifference is associated with both satisfaction and dissatisfaction.🔽Moreover, the natures of craving and hatred are not satisfaction and dissatisfaction, but they are in accord with the dharmas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction and can be associated with them. They are said to be the activities of satisfaction and dissatisfaction because they are associated with them.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a03_8']	如是捨受性非即歡慼，與欣慼品法相隨順故，容可與彼歡慼品相應，由彼相應說為歡慼行。	如是捨受性非即歡慼，與欣慼品法相隨順故，容可與彼歡慼品相應，由彼相應說為歡慼行。	In the same way, the nature of the feeling of indifference is not satisfaction and dissatisfaction, but it is in accord with the dharmas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction and can be associated with them. It is said to be the activity of satisfaction and dissatisfaction because it is associated with them.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a03_18']	欲界既爾，上地云何？	欲界既爾，上地云何？	The same is true of the realm of desire. What about the upper two realms?
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a04_15']	皆隨所應遍與自地自識俱起諸受相應。	皆隨所應遍與自地自識俱起諸受相應。	They are all associated with the feeling of their own realm, as is appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a06_5']	謂若地中具有四識，彼一一識所起煩惱，各遍自識諸受相應。	謂若地中具有四識，彼一一識所起煩惱，各遍自識諸受相應。	That is, if a realm has four consciousnesses, the passions that arise from each consciousness are associated with the feelings of that consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a07_13']	若諸地中唯有意識，即彼意識所起煩惱，遍與意識諸受相應。	若諸地中唯有意識，即彼意識所起煩惱，遍與意識諸受相應。	If a realm has only mental consciousness, the passions that arise from mental consciousness are associated with the feelings of mental consciousness.

['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a10_19']	謂初二三四等，如次具喜樂捨，喜捨樂捨唯捨應知，隨諸地中所有煩惱，如應與彼識受相應。	謂初二三四等，如次具喜樂捨，喜捨樂捨唯捨應知，隨諸地中所有煩惱，如應與彼識受相應。	The first, second, third, and fourth trance states have joy, pleasure, indifference, joy and indifference, pleasure and indifference, and indifference, respectively. You should know that the passions of each realm are associated with the consciousnesses and feelings of that realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a12_7']	何緣二疑俱不決定，而上得與喜樂相應，非欲界疑喜受俱起？	何緣二疑俱不決定，而上得與喜樂相應，非欲界疑喜受俱起？	Why is it that the two doubts are both indecisive, and yet in the upper realms they are associated with joy and pleasure, while in the realm of desire doubt is not associated with the feeling of joy?
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a13_15']	以諸煩惱在離欲地，雖不決定亦不憂慼，雖懷疑網無廢情怡。	以諸煩惱在離欲地，雖不決定亦不憂慼，雖懷疑網無廢情怡。	Even though the passions are not definitely present in the stage of separation from passion, still they are not sorrowful. Even though one may harbor doubt, one’s feelings are not disturbed.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a14_14']	如在人間求得所愛，雖多勞倦而生樂想。	如在人間求得所愛，雖多勞倦而生樂想。	It is like the case of a person in the world who, having obtained what he desires, even though he is tired out, still has a feeling of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a16_12']	有說色界喜樂與疑得相應者，俱寂靜故，依平等義建立相應，既等寂靜相應無失。	有說色界喜樂與疑得相應者，俱寂靜故，依平等義建立相應，既等寂靜相應無失。	There is an opinion that joy and pleasure in the realm of form can be associated with doubt, because both are tranquil. On the basis of the meaning of equality, one can establish association. Since they are equally tranquil, there is no error in their association.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a18_1']	如欲喜根非處生故相不寂靜，疑則不然，由此喜疑無相應理。	如欲喜根非處生故相不寂靜，疑則不然，由此喜疑無相應理。	It is like the case of the faculty of joy in the realm of desire, which is not tranquil because it is not in a proper state. Doubt is not so, and therefore there is no principle of association between joy and doubt.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a19_17']	謂世現見有貧賤人，頭面身支垢膩臭穢，手足皴裂匱食乏衣，復為重擔之所鎮壓。	謂世現見有貧賤人，頭面身支垢膩臭穢，手足皴裂匱食乏衣，復為重擔之所鎮壓。	It is a fact of the world that poor and lowly people have faces, heads, and limbs that are dirty, greasy, and malodorous, with cracked hands and feet, and they are lacking in food and clothing and are oppressed by heavy burdens.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a21_6']	雖遭此等種種艱辛，而有歡娛歌舞嘯詠，或見他苦而反生歡。	雖遭此等種種艱辛，而有歡娛歌舞嘯詠，或見他苦而反生歡。	Even though they suffer these various hardships, they still have feelings of pleasure, singing, dancing, and laughing, or they may feel pleasure when they see the suffering of others.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a22_6']	如是喜根有非處起，疑則不爾，故無等義。	如是喜根有非處起，疑則不爾，故無等義。	In this way, the faculty of joy is produced in an improper state, but this is not so of doubt. Therefore there is no meaning of equality.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a22_16']	由不等故，無相應理。	由不等故，無相應理。	Because they are not equal, there is no principle of association.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a24_4']	有說色界雖復懷疑，而於疑中生善品想，故彼得與喜樂相應。	有說色界雖復懷疑，而於疑中生善品想，故彼得與喜樂相應。	Some say that although the form realm gives rise to doubt, it gives rise to the notion of wholesome factors within doubt, and therefore it can be associated with joy and pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a25_3']	謂彼現見諸離欲者，多分因疑能引正定。	謂彼現見諸離欲者，多分因疑能引正定。	This is because they directly see that for those who have separated from desire, doubt often leads to right concentration.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a26_11']	有說初二三靜慮中與疑俱生，應全無受，故但應與本性受俱。	有說初二三靜慮中與疑俱生，應全無受，故但應與本性受俱。	Some say that in the first two and third meditative absorptions, that which arises together with doubt should be completely without feeling, and therefore it should only be associated with the feeling that is its intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_055:0648a27_10']	已辯煩惱諸受相應，今次復應辯隨煩惱。	已辯煩惱諸受相應，今次復應辯隨煩惱。	Having distinguished the association of the afflictions with feelings, we should now further distinguish the secondary afflictions.

They can maintain the possession of the passions of the past and future, and cause the passions that take this as their object and those that take other things as their object to continue in a series. When the counteragents to abandonment and their outflow that take this as their object arise, the obtainment of the passions is then cut off.

['ZH_T29_1562_055:0651b07_7']	若於少境得遍知時，惑所引得便不復轉，故知惑斷定從所緣。	若於少境得遍知時，惑所引得便不復轉，故知惑斷定從所緣。	When one obtains full knowledge of a small object, the obtainment attracted by the passions does not occur again. Therefore we know that the abandonment of the passions definitely results from the object.

Even though there is no time of fever, confusion, etc., because the poison is in the body due to the cause of fever, etc., one is always called a sick person, not a non-sick person. One is only called a non-sick person, not a sick person, after taking the medicine Agada that is contrary to the poison.

It is said that Agada can cure all illnesses.

It can purify the body and faculties of the practitioner, and because the afflictions do not continue, it is called cutting off.
