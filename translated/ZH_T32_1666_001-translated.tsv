All dharmas only exist due to deluded thoughts and have distinctions. If one departs from deluded thoughts, then there are no characteristics of any objects.
['ZH_T32_1666_001:0576a12_18']	是故一切法從本已來，離言說相、離名字相、離心緣相，畢竟平等、無有變異、不可破壞。	是故一切法從本已來，離言說相、離名字相、離心緣相，畢竟平等、無有變異、不可破壞。	001	Therefore, all dharmas from the very beginning are apart from the characteristics of speech, apart from the characteristics of names and words, and apart from the characteristics of mental activity.

['ZH_T32_1666_001:0576a29_1']	所言空者，從本已來一切染法不相應故，謂離一切法差別之相，以無虛妄心念故。	所言空者，從本已來一切染法不相應故，謂離一切法差別之相，以無虛妄心念故。	001	As for what is said to be empty, from the very beginning it is not associated with any defiled dharmas, that is to say, it is apart from the characteristics of distinctions among dharmas, because there are no false thoughts.
['ZH_T32_1666_001:0576b02_17']	當知真如自性，非有相、非無相、非非有相、非非無相、非有無俱相，非一相、非異相、非非一相、非非異相、非一異俱相。	當知真如自性，非有相、非無相、非非有相、非非無相、非有無俱相，非一相、非異相、非非一相、非非異相、非一異俱相。	001	One should know that the nature of suchness is neither a characteristic of existence, nor a characteristic of nonexistence, nor a characteristic of neither existence nor nonexistence, nor a characteristic of both existence and nonexistence, neither a single characteristic nor a different characteristic, neither a characteristic of neither being the same nor being different, nor a characteristic of both being the same and being different.
['ZH_T32_1666_001:0576b05_1']	乃至總說，依一切眾生以有妄心念念分別，皆不相應故說為空，若離妄心實無可空故。	乃至總說，依一切眾生以有妄心念念分別，皆不相應故說為空，若離妄心實無可空故。	001	In brief, it is said that based on all sentient beings who have deluded thoughts and moments of discrimination, it is all not in accord, and therefore it is said to be empty. If one departs from deluded thoughts, there is truly nothing to be empty, and therefore it is not empty.
['ZH_T32_1666_001:0576b07_15']	所言不空者，已顯法體空無妄故，即是真心常恒不變淨法滿足，故名不空，亦無有相可取，以離念境界唯證相應故。	所言不空者，已顯法體空無妄故，即是真心常恒不變淨法滿足，故名不空，亦無有相可取，以離念境界唯證相應故。	001	What is said to be not empty is the manifestation of the essence of dharmas being empty and devoid of delusion, and it is the true mind that is eternally unchanging and replete with pure dharmas, and therefore it is called not empty. It also has no characteristics that can be grasped, because it is the realm of the absence of thought and is only in accord with the characteristics of realization.

That is to say, the unborn and unceasing is united with arising and ceasing, neither the same nor different, and is called the ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T32_1666_001:0576b10_17']	此識有二種義，能攝一切法、生一切法。	此識有二種義，能攝一切法、生一切法。	001	This consciousness has two kinds of meanings, which are able to include all dharmas and give rise to all dharmas.
