['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a07_7']	何法為想？	何法為想？	006	What is perception?
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a07_10']	答曰：	答曰：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a07_19']	取假法相故名為想。	取假法相故名為想。	006	It is called perception because it grasps the characteristics of provisional phenomena.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a08_4']	所以者何？	所以者何？	006	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a08_9']	如經中說：	如經中說：	006	As it is said in the sūtras:
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a09_9']	有人少想、有人多想、有人無量想、無所有想。	有人少想、有人多想、有人無量想、無所有想。	006	Some people have little perception, some have much perception, some have immeasurable perception, and some have no perception.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a10_8']	而實無此多少等諸法，故知想者取假法相。	而實無此多少等諸法，故知想者取假法相。	006	But in reality there are no such phenomena of much, little, etc., therefore one should know that perception is grasping the characteristics of provisional phenomena.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a13_7']	是想多在顛倒中說，如說無常中常想顛倒、苦中樂想顛倒、無我中我想顛倒、不淨中淨想顛倒，亦於信解觀一切入等中說。	是想多在顛倒中說，如說無常中常想顛倒、苦中樂想顛倒、無我中我想顛倒、不淨中淨想顛倒，亦於信解觀一切入等中說。	006	This perception is often spoken of in terms of delusion, such as saying that the delusion of perceiving permanence in what is impermanent, the delusion of perceiving happiness in what is suffering, the delusion of perceiving self in what is non-self, and the delusion of perceiving purity in what is impure, and it is also spoken of in the context of faith, understanding, and the various spheres of perception.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a15_6']	又以想三種差別取緣，謂怨、親、中人，於是緣中次生三受，受生三毒，故想有過。	又以想三種差別取緣，謂怨、親、中人，於是緣中次生三受，受生三毒，故想有過。	006	Moreover, it grasps objects through the discrimination of three kinds of thoughts, namely, thoughts of enemies, friends, and neutral persons. From these objects, the three feelings arise in sequence, and from the feelings, the three poisons arise. Therefore, thought has faults.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a17_1']	想有過故佛說應斷，如說眼見色莫取想，故知取假法相是名為想。	想有過故佛說應斷，如說眼見色莫取想，故知取假法相是名為想。	006	Because thought has faults, the Buddha taught that it should be eliminated. As it is said, When the eye sees forms, do not grasp thoughts. Therefore, we know that grasping the characteristics of nominally existent dharmas is called thought.

['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a20_5']	善修無常想故，能斷一切欲染色染及無色染，一切戲掉我慢無明。	善修無常想故，能斷一切欲染色染及無色染，一切戲掉我慢無明。	006	By skillfully cultivating the thought of impermanence, one can eliminate all desires, afflictions of the realm of form, afflictions of the formless realm, all playfulness, agitation, conceit, and ignorance.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a21_9']	故知非但取假法想，取假法想則不應能斷諸煩惱。	故知非但取假法想，取假法想則不應能斷諸煩惱。	006	Therefore, we know that it is not merely the thought of grasping nominally existent dharmas. The thought of grasping nominally existent dharmas should not be able to eliminate all afflictions.

['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a26_12']	又如說以不黑不白業能盡諸業，亦說信能渡河、一心渡海、精進除苦、慧能清淨，而實以慧得渡，不以信等，如是智慧以想名說。	又如說以不黑不白業能盡諸業，亦說信能渡河、一心渡海、精進除苦、慧能清淨，而實以慧得渡，不以信等，如是智慧以想名說。	006	Also, it is said that non-black and non-white karma can exhaust all karma, and it is also said that faith can cross a river, single-mindedness can cross the ocean, diligence can remove suffering, and wisdom can purify. However, one actually crosses by wisdom, not by faith, etc., and in the same way, wisdom is referred to by the name of thought.

It is said that the noble disciples use the blade of wisdom to cut off all afflictions. Therefore, we know that wisdom can sever bonds, not thought.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281a29_12']	又三十七聖道品中不說想名，故不斷結。	又三十七聖道品中不說想名，故不斷結。	006	Also, among the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, the name of thought is not mentioned, so it does not sever bonds.

['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b03_3']	又三無漏根中說，未知欲知根、知根、知已根，皆以知為名。	又三無漏根中說，未知欲知根、知根、知已根，皆以知為名。	006	Also, among the three roots of non-outflow, the root of wanting to know that which is not yet known, the root of knowing, and the root of knowing that which has been known, all are named after knowing.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b03_17']	又佛說慧為慧品、解脫知見品。	又佛說慧為慧品、解脫知見品。	006	Also, the Buddha said that wisdom is the category of wisdom and the category of liberation and knowing-seeing.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b04_11']	又說無禪不智、無智不禪。	又說無禪不智、無智不禪。	006	Also, it is said that there is no meditation without wisdom, and no wisdom without meditation.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b04_19']	又《次第經》說：	又《次第經》說：	006	Also, the Sutra of Sequence says:
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b05_17']	持淨戒者則心不悔，乃至攝心得如實知。	持淨戒者則心不悔，乃至攝心得如實知。	006	One who upholds pure precepts does not regret in the mind, and finally attains true knowledge by concentrating the mind.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b06_9']	又法智等皆以慧為名。	又法智等皆以慧為名。	006	Moreover, Dharma knowledge, etc. are all named after wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b07_15']	又三學中慧學最勝，亦說智慧具足、解脫知見具足。	又三學中慧學最勝，亦說智慧具足、解脫知見具足。	006	Moreover, among the three learnings, the learning of wisdom is the most excellent, and it is also said that wisdom is complete, and liberation and insight are complete.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b08_4']	又七淨中說知見淨。	又七淨中說知見淨。	006	Moreover, among the seven purities, it is said that the purity of knowledge and insight.

['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b10_7']	又理應用慧斷諸煩惱，不是想也。	又理應用慧斷諸煩惱，不是想也。	006	Moreover, in principle, one should use wisdom to eliminate all afflictions, not conceptualization.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b10_12']	所以者何？	所以者何？	006	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b11_1']	如《大因緣經》說：	如《大因緣經》說：	006	As the Mahānidāna Sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b12_4']	若義入修多羅，不違法相、隨順比尼，是義應取。	若義入修多羅，不違法相、隨順比尼，是義應取。	006	If the meaning enters the sūtras, does not contradict the characteristics of the Dharma, and accords with the vinaya, then that meaning should be accepted.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b14_8']	又說於正義中置隨義語，於正語中置隨語義，故經雖說無常想等能斷諸結，理應是慧。	又說於正義中置隨義語，於正語中置隨語義，故經雖說無常想等能斷諸結，理應是慧。	006	Moreover, it is said that in the correct meaning, one should place the words according to the meaning, and in the correct words, one should place the meaning according to the words. Therefore, although the sūtras say that the conceptualization of impermanence, etc. can eliminate the bonds, in principle, it should be wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1646_006:0281b15_15']	又說無明是煩惱根，離無明故慧得解脫，故以慧斷諸煩惱。	又說無明是煩惱根，離無明故慧得解脫，故以慧斷諸煩惱。	006	It is also said that ignorance is the root of afflictions. Apart from ignorance, wisdom attains liberation. Therefore, wisdom eliminates all afflictions.
