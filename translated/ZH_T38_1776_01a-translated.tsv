['ZH_T38_1776_01a:0421b04_6']	於最後身，值佛為說十二緣法而得悟道。	於最後身，值佛為說十二緣法而得悟道。	01a	In their final lifetime, they encountered the Buddha, who taught them the Dharma of the twelve links of dependent origination, and they attained enlightenment.

Now, upon first seeing the Buddha, they are able to enter the Great Vehicle. The Great Vehicle does not rely on the Lesser Vehicle. This is called sudden.
['ZH_T38_1776_01a:0421b16_6']	故經說言「或有眾生，世世已來常受我化，始見我身、聞我所說即皆信受入如來慧。	故經說言「或有眾生，世世已來常受我化，始見我身、聞我所說即皆信受入如來慧。	01a	Therefore, the sutra says, There are sentient beings who, from lifetime to lifetime, have always received my transformation. Upon first seeing my body and hearing what I say, they all give rise to faith and acceptance and enter the Tathāgata's wisdom.
['ZH_T38_1776_01a:0421b16_12']	」此是頓悟。	」此是頓悟。	01a	This is sudden enlightenment.
