['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c03_10']	無學身業名身牟尼，無學語業名語牟尼，即無學意名意牟尼。	無學身業名身牟尼，無學語業名語牟尼，即無學意名意牟尼。	The bodily action of the post-learner is called the muni of the body, the verbal action of the post-learner is called the muni of speech, and the post-learner's mind itself is called the muni of mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c03_19']	非意牟尼意業為體。	非意牟尼意業為體。	The muni of mind is not taken as having the mental action as its essence.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c07_7']	心寂靜故有情寂靜。	心寂靜故有情寂靜。	Because the mind is tranquil, sentient beings are tranquil.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c08_6']	此心牟尼，由身語業離眾惡故可以比知。	此心牟尼，由身語業離眾惡故可以比知。	This mind of the Muni, because it is free from evil through bodily and verbal actions, can be inferred.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c09_5']	意業於中無能比用，唯能所比合立牟尼。	意業於中無能比用，唯能所比合立牟尼。	Mental action is not able to be inferred in the middle, only the inferred and the inferring are combined to establish the Muni.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c12_11']	無漏妙行永離惡行煩惱垢故，可名清淨。	無漏妙行永離惡行煩惱垢故，可名清淨。	Because uncontaminated excellent conduct is eternally free from the defilements of evil conduct and afflictions, it can be called purity.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c13_10']	有漏妙行猶為惡行煩惱垢污，如何清淨？	有漏妙行猶為惡行煩惱垢污，如何清淨？	How can contaminated excellent conduct, which is still defiled by the stains of evil conduct and afflictions, be pure?
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c14_9']	此亦暫時能離惡行煩惱垢故，得清淨名。	此亦暫時能離惡行煩惱垢故，得清淨名。	This is also called purity because it is temporarily able to be free from the stains of evil conduct and afflictions.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c17_3']	若謂此亦能引煩惱垢故，謂作煩惱等無間緣，是則不應名清淨者，此亦非理。	若謂此亦能引煩惱垢故，謂作煩惱等無間緣，是則不應名清淨者，此亦非理。	If you say that it is also able to induce the defilements, because it is the condition as the equivalent and immediate antecedent of the defilements, then it should not be called pure. This is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c18_6']	善心起時，非為染心起加行故，染心無間無漏不生。	善心起時，非為染心起加行故，染心無間無漏不生。	When a good mind arises, it is not because a defiled mind has generated effort. Therefore, a pure mind does not arise immediately after a defiled mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c19_14']	有漏善心能引無漏，故有漏善得清淨名，順無漏心能除穢故。	有漏善心能引無漏，故有漏善得清淨名，順無漏心能除穢故。	Because a good mind that is impure is able to induce a pure mind, good that is impure is called pure, because it is in conformity with a pure mind and is able to eliminate impurity.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c20_13']	說此二者，為息有情計邪牟尼、邪清淨故。	說此二者，為息有情計邪牟尼、邪清淨故。	The reason for explaining these two is to cause sentient beings to cease to imagine that there is a wrong Muni and a wrong purity.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0878c29_3']	豈不契經亦說貪等名為意業，如何今說貪嗔邪見非意業邪？	豈不契經亦說貪等名為意業，如何今說貪嗔邪見非意業邪？	Isn't it also said in the scriptures that greed, etc. are called mental actions? How can it be said now that greed, anger, and wrong views are not mental actions?
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879a01_3']	是業資糧故亦名業，如漏資糧亦名漏等。	是業資糧故亦名業，如漏資糧亦名漏等。	Because they are the provisions for action, they are also called action, just as the provisions for defilements are also called defilements, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879a02_12']	是諸聖賢所訶厭故，又能感得非愛果故，此行即惡，故名惡行。	是諸聖賢所訶厭故，又能感得非愛果故，此行即惡，故名惡行。	Because they are despised and condemned by all sages and saints, and because they can lead to undesirable consequences, these practices are evil, and therefore called evil conduct.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879a03_1']	三妙行者翻此應知。	三妙行者翻此應知。	The three good practices should be understood in the opposite way.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879a05_14']	然意妙行復有三種，非業無貪、無嗔、正見。	然意妙行復有三種，非業無貪、無嗔、正見。	However, mental good conduct is of three kinds: non-action, non-greed, non-anger, and right views.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879a06_13']	智所讚故，感愛果故，此行即妙，故名妙行。	智所讚故，感愛果故，此行即妙，故名妙行。	Because it is praised by the wise, and because it produces a beloved fruit, this action is called good.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879a28_3']	七惡業道中六定有無表，謂殺生等，除欲邪行。	七惡業道中六定有無表，謂殺生等，除欲邪行。	Among the seven evil paths of action, the six are definitely without expression, namely killing and so forth, except for sexual misconduct.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879a29_2']	非如是六，若遣他為，至根本時有表生故。	非如是六，若遣他為，至根本時有表生故。	This is not like the six, if one sends another to do it, when one reaches the fundamental time, there is the arising of expression.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879b02_8']	若有自作彼六業道，則六皆有表無表二，謂起表時彼便死等、後方死等與遣使同，根本成時唯無表故。	若有自作彼六業道，則六皆有表無表二，謂起表時彼便死等、後方死等與遣使同，根本成時唯無表故。	If there is one who does these six paths of action oneself, then the six all have both expression and the inexpressible. This is because when one gives rise to expression, they immediately die and so forth, and later they die and so forth, the same as sending an emissary. When the fundamental is accomplished, there is only the inexpressible.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879b03_16']	唯欲邪行必具二種，要是自身所究竟故，非遣他作如自生喜。	唯欲邪行必具二種，要是自身所究竟故，非遣他作如自生喜。	There is only sexual misconduct, which must be of two kinds, because it is what is completed by one's own body. It is not like sending another to do it, giving rise to joy like oneself.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879b05_5']	七善業道若從受生必皆具二，謂表無表，受生尸羅必依表故。	七善業道若從受生必皆具二，謂表無表，受生尸羅必依表故。	The seven good paths of action, if born from receiving, must all be of two kinds, namely expression and the inexpressible. This is because the precepts born from receiving must rely on expression.

Non-manifest action may or may not exist in this stage. If it arises from intense entanglements and pure mind, then there is non-manifest action. Otherwise, there is none.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879b13_16']	後起翻前定有無表，此位表業或有或無，第二剎那無表為始名為後起，故此定有。	後起翻前定有無表，此位表業或有或無，第二剎那無表為始名為後起，故此定有。	The subsequent action is the opposite of the above. It definitely has non-manifest action. The beginning of non-manifest action in the second moment is called subsequent action. Therefore, it definitely exists.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0879b14_15']	若於爾時起隨前業則亦有表，異此便無。	若於爾時起隨前業則亦有表，異此便無。	If one gives rise to it according to the previous action, then it also has manifest action. Otherwise, it does not exist.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0881b21_8']	於有情類起憎恚心，欲為逼迫名瞋業道。	於有情類起憎恚心，欲為逼迫名瞋業道。	Giving rise to a mind of hatred and resentment towards sentient beings, wishing to oppress them, is called the karmic path of ill-will.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0881b22_7']	於善惡等惡見撥無，此見名為邪見業道。	於善惡等惡見撥無，此見名為邪見業道。	Denying the existence of good, evil, and so forth, this view is called the karmic path of wrong views.

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0881b29_10']	彼相應思說名為業，彼轉故轉、彼行故行，如彼勢力而造作故。	彼相應思說名為業，彼轉故轉、彼行故行，如彼勢力而造作故。	The volition associated with them is called action, because it turns due to them, it proceeds due to them, and it is produced by their power.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0881c01_1']	前七是業，身語業故；	前七是業，身語業故；	The first seven are action, because they are bodily and verbal action;

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0881c05_15']	或業之道故名業道，亦業亦道故名業道。	或業之道故名業道，亦業亦道故名業道。	Alternatively, it is called a “path of action” because it is the path of action, and it is also called a “path of action” because it is both action and a path.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0881c06_14']	具足應言業道業道，以一為餘但言業道。	具足應言業道業道，以一為餘但言業道。	It should be fully said to be a “path of action that is a path of action,” but because one is used for the other, it is simply called a “path of action.”

['ZH_T29_1563_022:0881c10_2']	理亦應說而不說者，為本依本彼方轉故，先說麁品為業道故，內外增減隨根本故。	理亦應說而不說者，為本依本彼方轉故，先說麁品為業道故，內外增減隨根本故。	Although it should be explained in this way, it is not explained. This is because they occur based on the fundamental path of action, because the coarse fundamental path of action is explained first, and because the internal and external increase and decrease follow the fundamental path of action.

Later, when they encounter evil friends and the power of conditions, they become even more violent, and thus the roots of goodness decrease and the roots of evil increase.

Therefore the substance of the severed roots of goodness is nonacquisition.
['ZH_T29_1563_022:0882a18_13']	前已成立非得實有，善根斷已由何復續？	前已成立非得實有，善根斷已由何復續？	We have already established that nonacquisition really exists. By what means does the continuity of the roots of goodness resume after they have been severed?

It is not the case that one severs the roots of good at the end of a kalpa or at the beginning of a kalpa, because the continuity of the roots of good is nourished.
