['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b11_21']	「宗等多言說能立」者，由宗、因、喻多言辯說，他未了義，為開示故，此之多言於《論式》等說名能立。	「宗等多言說能立」者，由宗、因、喻多言辯說，他未了義，為開示故，此之多言於《論式》等說名能立。	The many statements such as the thesis are able to establish means that by means of the many statements explaining the thesis, reason, and example, the meaning that others have not yet understood is revealed. These many statements are called able to establish in the treatise and other texts.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b13_11']	又以一言說能立者，為顯總成一能立性，由此應知隨有所闕名能立過。	又以一言說能立者，為顯總成一能立性，由此應知隨有所闕名能立過。	Moreover, by saying in one word to refer to the proponent, it is to show that they collectively form one type of proponent. From this, one should know that if any part is missing, it is a fallacy of the proponent.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b14_17']	言「是中」者，起論端義，或簡持義，是宗等中，故名是中。	言「是中」者，起論端義，或簡持義，是宗等中，故名是中。	As for the phrase in this, it has the meaning of initiating a discussion, or the meaning of selecting and upholding. It is called in this because it is within the thesis and so forth.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b15_6']	所言「唯」者，是簡別義。	所言「唯」者，是簡別義。	As for the word only, it has the meaning of distinguishing and differentiating.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b15_22']	「隨自意」顯不顧論宗，隨自意立。	「隨自意」顯不顧論宗，隨自意立。	According to one's own intention shows not caring about the thesis of the opponent, but establishing according to one's own intention.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b16_15']	「樂」為所立，謂不樂為能成立性。	「樂」為所立，謂不樂為能成立性。	What is desired refers to what is to be established, that is, not what is desired to be the nature of the means of establishing.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b17_13']	若異此者說所成立，似因、似喻應亦名宗。	若異此者說所成立，似因、似喻應亦名宗。	If it were otherwise, then what is to be established, similar to a reason, and similar to an example, should also be called a thesis.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b18_14']	為顯離餘立宗過失，故言「非彼相違義能遣」。	為顯離餘立宗過失，故言「非彼相違義能遣」。	In order to show that it is free from the fallacies of establishing a thesis, it says the meaning that is contrary to it cannot be refuted.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b19_13']	若非違義言聲所遣，如立「一切言皆是妄」；	若非違義言聲所遣，如立「一切言皆是妄」；	If the meaning that is contrary to it is refuted by the sound of words, like establishing all words are false;

['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b24_1']	又於有法，即彼所立為此極成現量、比量相違義遣，如有成立「聲非所聞」「瓶是常」等。	又於有法，即彼所立為此極成現量、比量相違義遣，如有成立「聲非所聞」「瓶是常」等。	Moreover, regarding the property-possessor, if what is established contradicts the meaning of what is commonly accepted by direct perception and inference, it is refuted, just as in establishing Sound is not audible or A pot is permanent and so on.

['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b26_17']	以於此中立「聲為常，一切皆是無常故」者，是喻方便惡立異法，由合喻顯非一切故。	以於此中立「聲為常，一切皆是無常故」者，是喻方便惡立異法，由合喻顯非一切故。	because in this case, establishing Sound is permanent, because all are impermanent is a bad establishment of a dissimilar example by means of a combined example, because it shows that not all [are impermanent].
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b27_12']	此因非有，以聲攝在一切中故。	此因非有，以聲攝在一切中故。	This reason does not exist, because sound is included in all.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b28_12']	或是所立一分義故，此義不成，名因過失。	或是所立一分義故，此義不成，名因過失。	Or because it is a part of the meaning to be established, this meaning is not established, and is called a fault of the reason.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b29_11']	喻亦有過，由異法喻先顯宗無，後說因無。	喻亦有過，由異法喻先顯宗無，後說因無。	The example also has a fault, because by a dissimilar example, the absence of the thesis is first shown, and then the absence of the reason is stated.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006b29_16']	應如是言：	應如是言：	It should be stated like this:
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c01_12']	「無常一切」是謂非「非一切故」義；	「無常一切」是謂非「非一切故」義；	Impermanent and all is called not not all.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c02_8']	然此倒說「一切無常」，是故此中喻亦有過。	然此倒說「一切無常」，是故此中喻亦有過。	However, this is an inverted statement that all are impermanent, and therefore the analogy here also has a fault.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c02_17']	如是已說宗及似宗。	如是已說宗及似宗。	Thus, the thesis and pseudo-thesis have been explained.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c03_16']	因與似因多是宗法，此差別相今當顯示。	因與似因多是宗法，此差別相今當顯示。	The reason and pseudo-reason are mostly the property of the thesis. The characteristics of their distinctions will now be revealed.

['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c05_15']	宗法於同品，　　謂有、非有、俱；	宗法於同品，　　謂有、非有、俱；	The property of the thesis in the similar instance is said to be existent, non-existent, and both;

['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c07_15']	豈不總以樂所成立合說為宗？	豈不總以樂所成立合說為宗？	Isn't it that the thesis is generally established by pleasure and spoken of together?
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c08_9']	云何此中乃言宗者唯取有法？	云何此中乃言宗者唯取有法？	How is it that in this context the thesis only takes the property of the subject?
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c08_14']	此無有失。	此無有失。	This is not a mistake.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c09_11']	以其總聲於別亦轉，如言「燒衣」；	以其總聲於別亦轉，如言「燒衣」；	Because the general sound also applies to the individual, like saying burning clothes;
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c09_20']	或有宗聲唯詮於法。	或有宗聲唯詮於法。	Or there is a thesis sound that only expresses the property.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c10_16']	此中宗法，唯取立論及敵論者決定同許。	此中宗法，唯取立論及敵論者決定同許。	Here, the property of the thesis only takes what is definitely agreed upon by the proponent and the opponent.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c11_12']	於同品中，有、非有等亦復如是。	於同品中，有、非有等亦復如是。	In the similar class, existence, non-existence, etc. are also like this.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c11_16']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c13_3']	今此唯依證了因故，但由智力了所說義，非如生因由能起用。	今此唯依證了因故，但由智力了所說義，非如生因由能起用。	Now, this only relies on the cause of proof and understanding, and only by the power of wisdom one understands the meaning of what is said, not like a productive cause that gives rise to function.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c14_2']	若爾，既取智為了因，是言便失能成立義。	若爾，既取智為了因，是言便失能成立義。	If that is so, since one takes wisdom as the cause of understanding, then speech loses the meaning of being able to establish.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c15_14']	此亦不然，令彼憶念本極成故，是故此中唯取彼此俱定許義，即為善說。	此亦不然，令彼憶念本極成故，是故此中唯取彼此俱定許義，即為善說。	This is also not so, because it causes them to remember what was originally well-established. Therefore, in this case, only taking what is definitely accepted by both parties is well-said.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c17_5']	由是若有彼此不同許，定非宗法，如有成立「聲是無常，眼所見故」。	由是若有彼此不同許，定非宗法，如有成立「聲是無常，眼所見故」。	Thus, if there is something that is not accepted by both parties, it definitely is not a property of the thesis, like establishing sound is impermanent because it is seen by the eye.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c18_4']	又若敵論不同許者，如對顯論「所作性故」。	又若敵論不同許者，如對顯論「所作性故」。	Moreover, if the opponent does not accept it, like in the case of the Vaibhāṣika, because of being produced.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c19_14']	又若猶豫，如依烟等起疑惑時，成立「大種和合火有，以現烟故」。	又若猶豫，如依烟等起疑惑時，成立「大種和合火有，以現烟故」。	Moreover, if there is doubt, like when giving rise to doubt based on smoke, etc., establishing fire exists in the combination of the primary elements, because smoke is present.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c21_2']	或於是處有法不成，如成立「我其體周遍，於一切處生樂等故」。	或於是處有法不成，如成立「我其體周遍，於一切處生樂等故」。	Or, in this case, the property to be established may not be established, as in the argument the self is all-pervading, because it produces pleasure, etc., everywhere.

['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c24_11']	於當所說因與相違及不定中，唯有共許決定言詞說名能立、或名能破。	於當所說因與相違及不定中，唯有共許決定言詞說名能立、或名能破。	In the case of a reason that contradicts the probandum or is inconclusive, only statements that are commonly accepted and certain are called valid proofs or refutations.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c25_6']	非互不成猶豫言詞，復待成故。	非互不成猶豫言詞，復待成故。	Ambiguous statements that are not mutually established require further proof.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c26_4']	夫立宗法，理應更以餘法為因成立此法：	夫立宗法，理應更以餘法為因成立此法：	When establishing a thesis, one should further use other properties as reasons to establish that property:
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c27_18']	若即成立有法為有、或立為無，如有成立「最勝為有，現見別物有總類故」；	若即成立有法為有、或立為無，如有成立「最勝為有，現見別物有總類故」；	If one establishes the property-possessor as existent or non-existent, as in the argument the supreme is existent, because it is seen that separate things have a general category;
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c28_9']	或立為「無，不可得故」。	或立為「無，不可得故」。	Or, it is established as non-existent, because it is not apprehended.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c28_14']	其義云何？	其義云何？	What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0006c29_18']	此中但立「別物定有一因為宗」，不立「最勝」，故無此失。	此中但立「別物定有一因為宗」，不立「最勝」，故無此失。	Here, only the proposition that there is definitely one cause for a separate entity is established, not the most excellent, so there is no such fault.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0007a01_19']	若立為「無」，亦假安立「不可得法」，是故亦無有有法過。	若立為「無」，亦假安立「不可得法」，是故亦無有有法過。	If it is established as non-existent, it is also provisionally established as the dharma of non-attainment, so there is also no fault of having an existent dharma.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0007a03_9']	若以有法立餘有法、或立其法，如以烟立火，或以火立觸，其義云何？	若以有法立餘有法、或立其法，如以烟立火，或以火立觸，其義云何？	If an existent dharma is established as another existent dharma, or if its dharma is established, like establishing fire with smoke, or establishing touch with fire, what is the meaning?

['ZH_T32_1629_001:0007a05_16']	若不爾者，依烟立火、依火立觸，應成宗義一分為因。	若不爾者，依烟立火、依火立觸，應成宗義一分為因。	If it were not so, then establishing fire based on smoke and establishing touch based on fire would constitute a part of the proposition as the reason.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0007a06_15']	又於此中非欲成立火、觸有性，共知有故。	又於此中非欲成立火、觸有性，共知有故。	Moreover, here it is not intended to establish that fire and touch have nature, because it is commonly known that they exist.
['ZH_T32_1629_001:0007a07_20']	又於此中觀所成故立法、有法，非德、有德，故無有過。	又於此中觀所成故立法、有法，非德、有德，故無有過。	Moreover, here the dharma and existent dharma are observed to be established, not quality and possessor of quality, so there is no fault.
