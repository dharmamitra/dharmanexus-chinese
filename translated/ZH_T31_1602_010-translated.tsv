['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526a26_1']	汝為觀察已計極微常、為不觀察計彼常耶？	汝為觀察已計極微常、為不觀察計彼常耶？	Do you consider the ultimate atom to be permanent after examination, or do you consider it to be permanent without examination?
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526a27_1']	若不觀察者，離慧觀察而定計常，不應道理。	若不觀察者，離慧觀察而定計常，不應道理。	If it is without examination, it is unreasonable to definitely consider it permanent apart from the examination of wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526a27_18']	若言已觀察者，違諸量故，不應道理。	若言已觀察者，違諸量故，不應道理。	If it is said to be after examination, it is unreasonable because it contradicts all valid cognitions.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526a29_14']	諸極微性為由細故計彼是常、為由與麁果物其相異故計彼常耶？	諸極微性為由細故計彼是常、為由與麁果物其相異故計彼常耶？	Is the nature of the ultimate atom considered to be permanent because it is subtle, or is it considered to be permanent because its characteristics differ from the gross effect-substance?
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b01_20']	若由細者，離散損減其性羸劣，而言是常，不應道理。	若由細者，離散損減其性羸劣，而言是常，不應道理。	If it is because of subtlety, it is unreasonable to say it is permanent, as its nature becomes weak due to dispersion and diminution.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b04_1']	若言由相異故者，是則極微，超過地水火風之相，不同種類相故，而言能生彼果，不應道理。	若言由相異故者，是則極微，超過地水火風之相，不同種類相故，而言能生彼果，不應道理。	If it is said to be because of the difference in characteristics, then the ultimate atom transcends the characteristics of earth, water, fire, and wind, and because its characteristics are not the same as those of the effect it produces, it is unreasonable to say it can produce that effect.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b04_17']	又彼極微亦無異相可得，故不中理。	又彼極微亦無異相可得，故不中理。	Moreover, those extremely subtle particles are also not found to have any different characteristics, so this is unreasonable.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b08_4']	若異相者，汝意云何？	若異相者，汝意云何？	If they have different characteristics, what do you think?
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b09_2']	為從離散極微麁物得生、為從聚集耶？	為從離散極微麁物得生、為從聚集耶？	Do coarse things arise from scattered extremely subtle particles or from aggregated ones?

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b10_18']	若從聚集者，汝意云何？	若從聚集者，汝意云何？	If they arise from aggregated ones, what do you think?
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b12_4']	彼麁果物從極微生時，為不過彼形質之量、為過彼量耶？	彼麁果物從極微生時，為不過彼形質之量、為過彼量耶？	When those coarse effects arise from extremely subtle particles, do they not exceed the size of their form and substance or do they exceed that size?
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b13_12']	若言不過彼形質量者，從形質分物生形質有分物，不應道理。	若言不過彼形質量者，從形質分物生形質有分物，不應道理。	If you say they do not exceed the size of their form and substance, then it is unreasonable for things that have form and substance to arise from things that have form and substance.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b15_6']	若言過者，諸極微體無細分故不可分析，所生麁物亦應是常，此不中理。	若言過者，諸極微體無細分故不可分析，所生麁物亦應是常，此不中理。	If you say it is past, the substance of the ultimate atom has no subtle parts and therefore cannot be analyzed. The coarse things produced should also be permanent. This is not reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b16_13']	若復說言有諸極微本無今起者，是則計極微常，不應道理。	若復說言有諸極微本無今起者，是則計極微常，不應道理。	If you further say that the ultimate atoms originally did not exist but now arise, then you would be conceiving the ultimate atom to be permanent, which is not reasonable.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b19_5']	若言如種子等者，應如種子體是無常。	若言如種子等者，應如種子體是無常。	If you say they are like seeds, then they should be impermanent like seeds.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b20_8']	若言如陶師等者，彼諸極微應有思慮，如陶師等。	若言如陶師等者，彼諸極微應有思慮，如陶師等。	If you say they are like a potter, etc., then those ultimate atoms should have thought like a potter, etc.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b21_16']	若言不如種等及陶師等者，是則相似喻不可得故，不應道理。	若言不如種等及陶師等者，是則相似喻不可得故，不應道理。	If you say they are not like seeds, etc., or like a potter, etc., then because a similar analogy cannot be found, it is not reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b22_5']	又汝意云何？	又汝意云何？	Moreover, what do you think?

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b24_19']	若言由有情者，彼外麁物由有情生，所依細物不由有情，不應道理，誰能於彼制其功能？	若言由有情者，彼外麁物由有情生，所依細物不由有情，不應道理，誰能於彼制其功能？	If you say that it is due to sentient beings, then it is unreasonable that coarse external things arise due to sentient beings, while the subtle things that support them do not arise due to sentient beings. Who can control their power?
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526b28_17']	若言不由有情者，是則無用而外物生，不應道理，如是隨念諸蘊及眾生故、由一境界一切識流不斷絕故、由想及受變異不變異故，計彼前際及計後際常住論者，不應道理。	若言不由有情者，是則無用而外物生，不應道理，如是隨念諸蘊及眾生故、由一境界一切識流不斷絕故、由想及受變異不變異故，計彼前際及計後際常住論者，不應道理。	If you say that it is not due to sentient beings, then it is unreasonable that external things arise without purpose. Thus, the theories of eternalism that speculate about the past and future based on the recollection of aggregates and sentient beings, the uninterrupted flow of all consciousnesses due to a single object, and the transformation and non-transformation of conceptualization and feeling are unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c01_18']	又由觀察不觀察故、由共相故、由自相故、由造作故、根本所用故，極微常論不應道理。	又由觀察不觀察故、由共相故、由自相故、由造作故、根本所用故，極微常論不應道理。	Moreover, the theory of the eternality of atoms is unreasonable due to observation and non-observation, due to common characteristics, due to specific characteristics, due to creation, and due to the function of the root.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c02_10']	是故計常論者，非如理說。	是故計常論者，非如理說。	Therefore, the theories of eternalism are not reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c05_19']	復次我今當說常住之相，若一切時無變異相、若一切種無變異相、若自然無變異相、若由他亦無變異相、又無生相，當知是常住相。	復次我今當說常住之相，若一切時無變異相、若一切種無變異相、若自然無變異相、若由他亦無變異相、又無生相，當知是常住相。	Next, I will now explain the characteristics of permanence. If there are no characteristics of change at all times, no characteristics of change in all aspects, no natural characteristics of change, no characteristics of change due to others, and no characteristics of arising, one should know that these are the characteristics of permanence.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c07_14']	皆宿作因論者，謂如有一，若沙門若婆羅門，起如是見，立如是論，廣說如經。	皆宿作因論者，謂如有一，若沙門若婆羅門，起如是見，立如是論，廣說如經。	As for the theory of past karma as the cause, it refers to a case where a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa gives rise to such a view and establishes such a theory, as explained in detail in the sūtra.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c10_5']	由勤精進吐舊業故者，謂由現法極自苦行。	由勤精進吐舊業故者，謂由現法極自苦行。	Due to diligently cultivating effort and expelling old karma means due to the extreme self-mortification of the present Dharma.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c11_7']	現在新業由不作因之所害故者，謂諸不善業。	現在新業由不作因之所害故者，謂諸不善業。	The new karma of the present is harmed by the cause of non-action means all unwholesome karma.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c12_10']	如是於後不復有漏者，謂一向是善性，故說後無漏。	如是於後不復有漏者，謂一向是善性，故說後無漏。	In this way, there will be no more contamination in the future means that it is exclusively of wholesome nature, and therefore it is said that there will be no more contamination in the future.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c13_3']	由無漏故業盡者，謂諸惡業。	由無漏故業盡者，謂諸惡業。	Because of being without outflows, karma is exhausted means all evil karma.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c14_7']	由業盡故苦盡者，謂宿因所感及現法方便所招苦惱。	由業盡故苦盡者，謂宿因所感及現法方便所招苦惱。	Because of the exhaustion of karma, suffering is exhausted means the suffering caused by past causes and the suffering brought about by present expedient means.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c15_17']	謂無繫外道作如是計。	謂無繫外道作如是計。	It is said that the non-Buddhist Ājīvikas have such a view.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c19_6']	由見現法所作功用不決定故。	由見現法所作功用不決定故。	Because of seeing the uncertainty of the present effort.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c20_16']	彼見世間雖具正方便而招於苦、雖具邪方便而致於樂。	彼見世間雖具正方便而招於苦、雖具邪方便而致於樂。	Because they see that in the world, even with right effort, suffering is encountered; even with wrong effort, happiness is attained.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c21_2']	彼如是思：	彼如是思：	They think like this:
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c22_1']	若由現法所作功用為彼因者，彼應顛倒。	若由現法所作功用為彼因者，彼應顛倒。	If they were caused by present effort, they would be inverted.
['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c23_1']	由彼所見非顛倒故，是故彼皆以宿作為因。	由彼所見非顛倒故，是故彼皆以宿作為因。	Because what they see is not inverted, therefore they all have past karma as their cause.

['ZH_T31_1602_010:0526c28_11']	若用宿作為因者，汝先所說由勤精進吐舊業故，現在新業由不作因之所害故，如是於後不復有漏，乃至廣說，不應道理。	若用宿作為因者，汝先所說由勤精進吐舊業故，現在新業由不作因之所害故，如是於後不復有漏，乃至廣說，不應道理。	If you say it is caused by past karma, then what you previously said, By diligently expending effort to expel old karma, the present new karma is harmed by the cause of non-action, thus in the future there will be no more outflows, and so on, would not be reasonable.

Therefore, this treatise is not a correct explanation.

If one has blessings, one obtains wealth and happiness;
