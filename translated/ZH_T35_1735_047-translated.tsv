['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a07_10']	一通，謂前三品別答前問，此下三品總明等覺深奧故；	一通，謂前三品別答前問，此下三品總明等覺深奧故；	047	First, generally speaking, the previous three chapters specifically answer the previous questions, while the following three chapters comprehensively discuss the profound and mysterious state of equal enlightenment;
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a08_16']	二別，謂前既智圓證極，此品校量行德難思，故次來也。	二別，謂前既智圓證極，此品校量行德難思，故次來也。	047	Second, specifically speaking, since the previous chapter has perfected wisdom and ultimate realization, this chapter compares and measures the inconceivable virtues of practice, so it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a10_9']	又難思佛德，菩薩盡窮，故亦為遠答變化海故，故下偈中廣顯變化大用。	又難思佛德，菩薩盡窮，故亦為遠答變化海故，故下偈中廣顯變化大用。	047	Moreover, the inconceivable Buddha virtues are fully comprehended by bodhisattvas, so it also answers the question of the ocean of transformations from afar, thus the verses below extensively reveal the great function of transformations.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a11_1']	又通顯一部之數量故。	又通顯一部之數量故。	047	Moreover, it comprehensively reveals the quantity of the entire text.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a12_2']	二釋名者，阿之言無，僧祇曰數，全帶數名。	二釋名者，阿之言無，僧祇曰數，全帶數名。	047	Second, as for the explanation of the name, asaṃkhyeya means no and saṃkhyeya means number, completely retaining the name of the number.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a14_3']	若晉本云心王菩薩問阿僧祇品，兼能問人，即人法雙舉，及菩薩所問之算數，梵本同此。	若晉本云心王菩薩問阿僧祇品，兼能問人，即人法雙舉，及菩薩所問之算數，梵本同此。	047	If the Jin version says Bodhisattva Mind King asks about the asaṃkhyeya chapter, it includes both the person who can ask and the person, which is the simultaneous raising of person and dharma, as well as the calculation asked by the bodhisattva. The Sanskrit version is the same as this.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a15_4']	然僧祇是十大數之創首，經論多用，故以標名。	然僧祇是十大數之創首，經論多用，故以標名。	047	However, asaṃkhyeya is the beginning of the ten great numbers, and is often used in sūtras and śāstras, so it is used to name the chapter.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a16_1']	又顯此數即離數故，寄無數標名。	又顯此數即離數故，寄無數標名。	047	Moreover, it shows that this number is both manifest and unmanifest, so it is named after the unmanifest.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a17_12']	三宗趣者，寄數顯德分齊為宗，令知普賢諸佛離數重重無盡為趣。	三宗趣者，寄數顯德分齊為宗，令知普賢諸佛離數重重無盡為趣。	047	Third, as for the purport, the chapter takes the division of the manifest virtues as its purport, and takes the understanding that Samantabhadra and all Buddhas are beyond number and inexhaustible as its goal.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a17_17']	四正釋文。	四正釋文。	047	Fourth, the correct explanation of the text.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a18_13']	此下三品總顯深奧，即為三別：	此下三品總顯深奧，即為三別：	047	The three chapters below this generally reveal the profound and mysterious, which are divided into three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a20_1']	此品明勝德無數、次品明盡一切時、後品明遍一切處。	此品明勝德無數、次品明盡一切時、後品明遍一切處。	047	This chapter clarifies the innumerable supreme virtues, the next chapter clarifies the exhaustion of all time, and the last chapter clarifies the pervasiveness of all places.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a21_14']	然此三品，初一通明佛菩薩德、次品正顯佛德兼明菩薩、後品唯明菩薩。	然此三品，初一通明佛菩薩德、次品正顯佛德兼明菩薩、後品唯明菩薩。	047	Moreover, these three chapters, the first one generally clarifies the virtues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, the next chapter correctly reveals the virtues of Buddhas while also clarifying those of bodhisattvas, and the last chapter only clarifies those of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a23_1']	所以爾者，亦是等覺亦名佛故，位後普賢是佛菩薩故。	所以爾者，亦是等覺亦名佛故，位後普賢是佛菩薩故。	047	The reason for this is that it is also equal enlightenment and also called Buddha, and after the stage, Samantabhadra is the Buddha Bodhisattva.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a23_12']	今初一品，先問、後答。	今初一品，先問、後答。	047	Now, the first chapter first asks and then answers.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a23_16']	問中二。	問中二。	047	In the question, there are two parts.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a24_13']	先牒佛所說、後「世尊」下正明諮問。	先牒佛所說、後「世尊」下正明諮問。	047	First, it cites what the Buddha has said, and then below World-Honored One, it clarifies the consultation.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a24_16']	今初。	今初。	047	Now, the first.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a25_17']	所以心王問者，表數不離心，數與非數皆自在故。	所以心王問者，表數不離心，數與非數皆自在故。	047	The reason why the mind king asks is to show that the mental factors are inseparable from the mind, and that both the mental factors and the non-mental factors are freely mastered.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a26_13']	又顯此數統收前後，辨超勝故。	又顯此數統收前後，辨超勝故。	047	Moreover, it shows that this mental factor comprehensively includes the preceding and succeeding, and distinguishes the superior.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a27_12']	所以偏問十者，舉後攝初，顯無盡故。	所以偏問十者，舉後攝初，顯無盡故。	047	The reason for asking specifically about ten is to take the latter to include the beginning, showing that it is inexhaustible.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a29_1']	前後文中多用此故，故文云如來演說，但問本數已攝諸轉。	前後文中多用此故，故文云如來演說，但問本數已攝諸轉。	047	Therefore, in the preceding and succeeding texts, this is often used. Therefore, the text says that when the Tathāgata expounds, he only asks about the fundamental number, which already includes all the transformations.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858a29_10']	第二「佛告」下答。	第二「佛告」下答。	047	The second, below The Buddha told him, is the answer.

['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b04_1']	如黃帝算法但有二十三數，始從一二終至正載，已說天地不容。	如黃帝算法但有二十三數，始從一二終至正載，已說天地不容。	047	The Huangdi algorithm only has twenty-three numbers, starting from one and two and ending with the correct measure, already explaining that heaven and earth do not contain it.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b04_10']	小乘六十已至無數。	小乘六十已至無數。	047	The Hinayana has sixty, already reaching the innumerable.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b05_17']	此有百二十四，倍倍變之，故非餘測，故數之終寄不可說。	此有百二十四，倍倍變之，故非餘測，故數之終寄不可說。	047	This has one hundred and twenty-four, multiplied again and again, therefore not measurable by others, so the end of counting is entrusted to the unspeakable.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b06_17']	況復偈初更積不可說，歷諸塵剎以顯無盡。	況復偈初更積不可說，歷諸塵剎以顯無盡。	047	Moreover, at the beginning of the verse, it is further accumulated that which cannot be spoken of, passing through various dust lands to show its inexhaustibility.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b07_12']	所以佛自答者，正表難思故。	所以佛自答者，正表難思故。	047	The reason why the Buddha himself answers is precisely to show the difficulty of thinking about it.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b08_10']	又明此品統語因位終德，故佛說之。	又明此品統語因位終德，故佛說之。	047	Moreover, it clarifies that this chapter generally speaks of the virtues at the end of the causal stage, therefore the Buddha speaks of it.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b09_2']	二「善男子」下誡聽許說。	二「善男子」下誡聽許說。	047	Second, Good man, and below, admonishes to listen and permits speaking.

['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b13_7']	初言一百洛叉為一俱胝者，是中等數。	初言一百洛叉為一俱胝者，是中等數。	047	The initial statement that one hundred lakṣas is one koṭi is the middle-level counting.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b14_16']	洛叉是萬，俱胝是億，故〈光明覺品〉云過一億，梵本皆云俱胝故。	洛叉是萬，俱胝是億，故〈光明覺品〉云過一億，梵本皆云俱胝故。	047	Lakṣa is ten thousand, koṭi is one hundred million, thus the Chapter on the Light of Wisdom says over one hundred million, the Sanskrit text all says koṭi, therefore.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b15_16']	若依《俱舍》以洛叉為億，則俱胝當兆也。	若依《俱舍》以洛叉為億，則俱胝當兆也。	047	If according to the Abhidharma-kośa, using lakṣa as one hundred million, then koṭi corresponds to one billion.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b17_8']	若兼取一十百千萬等下數法，則通有百三十七數，由前易故略不說之。	若兼取一十百千萬等下數法，則通有百三十七數，由前易故略不說之。	047	If also taking the lower counting methods such as one, ten, one hundred, one thousand, etc., then there are a total of one hundred and thirty-seven numbers, because the previous ones are easy, they are omitted.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858b18_6']	俱胝已下並是上等數法，倍倍變故。	俱胝已下並是上等數法，倍倍變故。	047	Koṭi and below are all the middle-level counting methods, because they are doubled.

This shows that the highest is the unspeakable transformation, which is still based on following the capacities of beings. According to the Buddha's knowledge, it is truly inexhaustible.
['ZH_T35_1735_047:0858c01_2']	言十重者，一初句，積不可說至不可說，然此應積最後不可說不可說轉，而但積不可說者，有二義故：	言十重者，一初句，積不可說至不可說，然此應積最後不可說不可說轉，而但積不可說者，有二義故：	047	As for the ten layers, the first sentence accumulates the unspeakable to the unspeakable. However, this should accumulate the final unspeakable unspeakable transformation, but it only accumulates the unspeakable, for two reasons:
