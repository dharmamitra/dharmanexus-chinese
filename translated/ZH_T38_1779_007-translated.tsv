['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b06_7']	故《大經》云「空者等者」，意引不空，即無為中具一切法。	故《大經》云「空者等者」，意引不空，即無為中具一切法。	007	Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says emptiness is equal, meaning it draws on the non-empty, which is complete in all dharmas within the unconditioned.

['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b10_10']	真法界中尚無界外出家度人，豈有形服度人功德？	真法界中尚無界外出家度人，豈有形服度人功德？	007	In the true Dharma realm, there are no monks who leave the home-life, let alone the merit of monks who have left the home-life.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b11_14']	又亦得名大小名同體異而訶，亦是況訶，前後並爾。	又亦得名大小名同體異而訶，亦是況訶，前後並爾。	007	It can also be called a reprimand with the same name but different substance, and it is also a reprimand by comparison, as is the case before and after.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b13_7']	即如羅云小乘中密，小乘之理尚不可得，況平等法界畢竟真空而云利耶？	即如羅云小乘中密，小乘之理尚不可得，況平等法界畢竟真空而云利耶？	007	It is like Rāhula's secrecy in the Hīnayāna. The principle of the Hīnayāna cannot be attained, let alone the equal true Dharma realm of ultimate emptiness, and to say it is beneficial?
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b15_5']	引彼真諦以證無為，大乘無為具諸功德，故不同小若有若無皆不能具一切諸法。	引彼真諦以證無為，大乘無為具諸功德，故不同小若有若無皆不能具一切諸法。	007	Citing that ultimate truth to prove the unconditioned, the unconditioned of the Mahāyāna is endowed with all merits, therefore it is not the same as the Hīnayāna, whether existent or non-existent, both cannot be endowed with all dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b15_10']	二、料簡。	二、料簡。	007	Second, analysis.

['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b16_7']	問淨名等者，經中祇云無為無利。	問淨名等者，經中祇云無為無利。	007	The sūtra only says that the unconditioned has no benefit.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b17_12']	此即問前引大涅槃、虛空、佛性、平等法界，此名自足。	此即問前引大涅槃、虛空、佛性、平等法界，此名自足。	007	This then asks about the previously cited Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, space, buddha-nature, and the equal true Dharma realm, these names are sufficient.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b18_1']	何以名之為真密行？	何以名之為真密行？	007	Why is it called true and secret practice?
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b18_10']	與無為義亦不相應。	與無為義亦不相應。	007	It is also not in accord with the meaning of being unconditioned.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b19_17']	答中意者，羅云正說小乘無為功德之利，又稱小中密行第一。	答中意者，羅云正說小乘無為功德之利，又稱小中密行第一。	007	The meaning of the answer is that Rāhula is correctly speaking of the benefits of the conditioned merits and virtues of the Hīnayāna, and also calling it the foremost in secrecy within the Hīnayāna.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b20_11']	淨名以大折其二事令俱不成。	淨名以大折其二事令俱不成。	007	Vimalakīrti uses the Mahāyāna to refute both of these matters, causing them to both be unsuccessful.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b21_12']	大乘無為如如意珠，珠即諸物，密豈過此？	大乘無為如如意珠，珠即諸物，密豈過此？	007	The unconditioned of the Mahāyāna is like a wish-fulfilling jewel. The jewel is all things. How could secrecy surpass this?
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b22_6']	無為之語其理未極，故云一往。	無為之語其理未極，故云一往。	007	The words unconditioned have not yet reached the ultimate principle, so it is said to be one-sided.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b23_17']	故知大乘無為非無勝利，以其羅云已得小乘無為，故以大乘無為折之。	故知大乘無為非無勝利，以其羅云已得小乘無為，故以大乘無為折之。	007	Therefore, it should be known that the unconditioned of the Mahāyāna is not without benefits. Since Rāhula has already attained the unconditioned of the Hīnayāna, it is refuted using the unconditioned of the Mahāyāna.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b25_10']	既破小已，方述大乘無為法遍，以明小乘有為無為並不能具一切諸法。	既破小已，方述大乘無為法遍，以明小乘有為無為並不能具一切諸法。	007	After refuting the Hīnayāna, it then explains the pervasiveness of the unconditioned Dharma of the Mahāyāna, clarifying that both the conditioned and unconditioned of the Hīnayāna are unable to encompass all dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b26_5']	若如是者，方是密行中之上品。	若如是者，方是密行中之上品。	007	If it is like this, then it is the highest level within secret practice.
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795b27_8']	故十人中皆以其行而為破立，以為半滿深淺之致。	故十人中皆以其行而為破立，以為半滿深淺之致。	007	Therefore, among the ten people, their practices are all used for refutation and establishment, serving as the basis for the profound and shallow distinctions between the half and full [teachings].

['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795c03_3']	「離一切見清淨禪」者，界外之見等覺方離，小果豈無？	「離一切見清淨禪」者，界外之見等覺方離，小果豈無？	007	As for the dhyāna that is free from all views and is pure, views beyond the realm of desire are only abandoned at the stage of equal enlightenment. How could the small fruits not have them?
['ZH_T38_1779_007:0795c03_16']	「處於涅槃」等者，荊溪云：	「處於涅槃」等者，荊溪云：	007	As for dwelling in nirvāṇa and so on, Jingxi says:
