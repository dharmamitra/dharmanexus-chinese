['ZH_T30_1567_006:0148c22_12']	未生無體，故不能生。	未生無體，故不能生。	006	Because what has not yet arisen has no substance, it cannot produce.

['ZH_T30_1567_006:0148c27_14']	若法已生還復生者，此義應知，如其作已不復更作，是故生已何復有生？	若法已生還復生者，此義應知，如其作已不復更作，是故生已何復有生？	006	If a dharma that has already arisen were to arise again, this meaning should be understood as follows: Just as what has been done does not need to be done again, so how could there be arising again after having already arisen?
['ZH_T30_1567_006:0148c28_8']	由此應知必無生法自生道理。	由此應知必無生法自生道理。	006	For this reason, one should understand that there is definitely no principle of a dharma arising by itself.
['ZH_T30_1567_006:0148c28_18']	若從他生，其義亦然。	若從他生，其義亦然。	006	If it arises from another, the meaning is also like this.
['ZH_T30_1567_006:0148c29_17']	若生時生者，離已生未生，別無生時可得。	若生時生者，離已生未生，別無生時可得。	006	If arising arises, apart from what has already arisen and what has not yet arisen, there is no separate arising that can be obtained.

How can there be arising in this case?
['ZH_T30_1567_006:0149a08_8']	若一切法有所生者，如是諦觀非今所說，豈有生時而可得耶？	若一切法有所生者，如是諦觀非今所說，豈有生時而可得耶？	006	If all dharmas have arising, such a thorough investigation is not what is being discussed now. How could there be a time of arising that can be attained?
['ZH_T30_1567_006:0149a08_17']	以彼生時無分位故。	以彼生時無分位故。	006	Because at the time of arising there is no stage.
['ZH_T30_1567_006:0149a10_10']	又一切法自體無分位可成，如是應知，若無生時，云何有彼生法可得？	又一切法自體無分位可成，如是應知，若無生時，云何有彼生法可得？	006	Moreover, the intrinsic nature of all dharmas has no stage that can be established.

['ZH_T30_1567_006:0149a17_6']	若復現轉之法常不離自相，此說相違。	若復現轉之法常不離自相，此說相違。	006	Moreover, if the dharma that is presently transforming is always not apart from its own characteristic, this is said to be contradictory.
