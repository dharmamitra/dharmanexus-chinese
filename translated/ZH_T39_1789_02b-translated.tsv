It says because of grasping the objects manifested by one's own mind, meaning that the eighth consciousness, as a cause, is able to grasp the objects manifested by one's own mind, which are the six sense objects. Because of attachment, the six consciousnesses arise. It is able to gather all minds, so it is called the arising of the aggregate of mind. This means that the eighth consciousness and the six consciousnesses arise by mutually causing each other. In this way, there is a fundamental and a derivative in mutual causation. The fundamental refers to the eighth consciousness transforming and giving rise to the various consciousnesses. The derivative refers to the six consciousnesses giving rise to good and evil. The seventh consciousness transmits between them, so it is said that they mutually cause each other.

The ocean is a metaphor for the eighth consciousness, and the waves are a metaphor for the six consciousnesses. The six sense objects are the wind of objects. The objects are manifested by one's own mind and still blow the ocean of the mind of the eighth consciousness, causing the various consciousnesses to arise and cease. It is also like the existence of wind relying on the ocean and the stirring of waves relying on the wind. The mutual relationship is like this.
