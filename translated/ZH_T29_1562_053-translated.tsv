['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c04_8']	且見道位苦智已生集智未生，見苦所斷諸事已斷，見集所斷遍行隨眠若未永斷，能緣此者於此猶繫。	且見道位苦智已生集智未生，見苦所斷諸事已斷，見集所斷遍行隨眠若未永斷，能緣此者於此猶繫。	Furthermore, in the stage of the path of insight, when the cognition of suffering has already arisen and the cognition of the cause has not yet arisen, all the things eliminated by the insight of the truth of suffering have already been eliminated, but the universal contaminants eliminated by the insight of the truth of the cause, if not yet eternally eliminated, still bind one to them.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c06_6']	及修道位隨何道生，九品事中前品已斷，餘未斷品所有隨眠，能緣此者於此猶繫。	及修道位隨何道生，九品事中前品已斷，餘未斷品所有隨眠，能緣此者於此猶繫。	Also, in the stage of the path of cultivation, when any path arises, among the nine categories of things, the previously eliminated categories still bind one to the remaining categories that have not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c07_6']	及聲兼明前前已斷、後後未斷，皆能繫義。	及聲兼明前前已斷、後後未斷，皆能繫義。	The word “and” in the verse indicates that the previously eliminated and the subsequently eliminated still bind one.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c07_15']	此中何用說緣此言？	此中何用說緣此言？	What is the use of saying “that which has them” here?
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c08_4']	修斷九品必相緣故。	修斷九品必相緣故。	Because the nine categories eliminated by cultivation necessarily reciprocally condition each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c09_5']	非是所緣者有時非所緣，故緣此言定為無用。	非是所緣者有時非所緣，故緣此言定為無用。	That which is not an object sometimes is not an object, and therefore the words “that which has them” are definitely useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c11_3']	若謂別說有不能緣，即遍行中亦應簡別，以有見集所斷遍行不緣見苦所斷事故。	若謂別說有不能緣，即遍行中亦應簡別，以有見集所斷遍行不緣見苦所斷事故。	If it is said that the separate explanation has that which is unable to be an object, then in the universal contaminants, it should also be distinguished, because there are universal contaminants eliminated by the insight of the truth of the cause that do not have as their object things eliminated by the insight of the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c11_12']	經主何意簡此非彼？	經主何意簡此非彼？	Why does the Śāstra-master distinguish this and not that?

['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c15_1']	此中所言前品已斷，約世俗道，隨其所應，總分見修所斷煩惱以為九品漸次斷除，前品已斷中，有餘未斷品，遍行煩惱亦能為繫。	此中所言前品已斷，約世俗道，隨其所應，總分見修所斷煩惱以為九品漸次斷除，前品已斷中，有餘未斷品，遍行煩惱亦能為繫。	The phrase “previously abandoned” in the above passage refers to the abandonment of the nine grades of passions by the mundane path, which is in accordance with the principle of gradual abandonment. The remaining passions of the same class as those previously abandoned and the universal passions are still able to bind.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c15_19']	簡緣他地遍行隨眠，說緣此言可成有用。	簡緣他地遍行隨眠，說緣此言可成有用。	The phrase “that which takes it as its object” is used to distinguish the passions that take other stages as objects, and thus the phrase is useful.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c16_18']	然於前說餘遍行中，闕緣此言，義不成立。	然於前說餘遍行中，闕緣此言，義不成立。	However, the phrase “that which takes it as its object” is omitted in the above passage on the universal passions, and the meaning is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c17_16']	或應以後所說及聲，兼顯前文攝緣此義。	或應以後所說及聲，兼顯前文攝緣此義。	Or, the word “and” in the above passage should be taken to indicate that the phrase “that which takes it as its object” is also included.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c19_6']	謂於前說見苦已斷，及此前品已斷事中，皆有所餘，緣此猶繫。	謂於前說見苦已斷，及此前品已斷事中，皆有所餘，緣此猶繫。	That is, in the above passage on the passions abandoned by the path of insight into suffering, and in the above passage on the passions previously abandoned, there are still universal passions that take these passions as objects and bind.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c20_4']	此文雜亂，於見位中，餘及遍行應隨去一。	此文雜亂，於見位中，餘及遍行應隨去一。	This passage is confused, because in the stage of insight, the phrase “the remaining universal passions” should be omitted.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c21_12']	然此煩說闕緣此言，應問慈尊自言意趣，何事有幾隨眠隨增？	然此煩說闕緣此言，應問慈尊自言意趣，何事有幾隨眠隨增？	However, the above passage omits the phrase “that which takes it as its object,” and we should ask the Venerable Maitreya himself about the meaning of the passage. How many passions increase in each object?
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c22_11']	此中但應辯所緣相，謂辯何法何識所緣？	此中但應辯所緣相，謂辯何法何識所緣？	Here, we should only discuss the characteristics of the objects of cognition, that is, what dharmas are the objects of what consciousnesses?
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c23_10']	則易了知此所繫事，定有爾所隨眠隨增。	則易了知此所繫事，定有爾所隨眠隨增。	Then it is easy to understand that the things that are bound to them definitely have so many latent afflictions that increase.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c23_19']	且法與識數各有幾？	且法與識數各有幾？	How many dharmas and consciousnesses are there?
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c24_17']	諸法雖多略為十六，三界五部及諸無漏。	諸法雖多略為十六，三界五部及諸無漏。	Although dharmas are many, they are briefly divided into sixteen: the five classes of the three realms and the pure ones.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0636c25_7']	能緣彼識名數亦然。	能緣彼識名數亦然。	The consciousnesses that can take them as objects are also counted in the same way.

['ZH_T29_1562_053:0637a05_1']	若欲界繫見苦見集修所斷法，各五識緣。	若欲界繫見苦見集修所斷法，各五識緣。	If they are objects abandoned by insight into the truths of suffering and of the cause of suffering in the realm of desire, they are the objects of five consciousnesses.

['ZH_T29_1562_053:0637a06_9']	無漏第五，皆容緣故。	無漏第五，皆容緣故。	The fifth is pure consciousness, because it is able to take all as objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0637a09_14']	且欲界繫見苦斷法，為自界三識所緣者，謂欲見苦所斷一切，及欲見集所斷遍行，欲修所斷善無記識，色修所斷善識非餘，無漏識中唯法智品。	且欲界繫見苦斷法，為自界三識所緣者，謂欲見苦所斷一切，及欲見集所斷遍行，欲修所斷善無記識，色修所斷善識非餘，無漏識中唯法智品。	As for objects abandoned by insight into the truth of suffering in the realm of desire, they are the objects of three consciousnesses of one’s own realm. That is, all of the realm of desire that is abandoned by insight into the truth of suffering and the truth of the cause of suffering in the realm of desire that is a universal proclivity. The good and indeterminate consciousnesses abandoned by the path of cultivation in the realm of desire, and the good consciousness of the realm of form that is abandoned by the path of cultivation, are not the others. In pure consciousness, it is only the class of the knowledge of the law.
['ZH_T29_1562_053:0637a10_4']	見集修斷如應當知。	見集修斷如應當知。	The objects abandoned by insight into the truth of the cause of suffering and by the path of cultivation should be understood accordingly.

This is because the entanglements in the upper realms are few and not autonomous. Therefore, the existence leakage only refers to afflictions.
