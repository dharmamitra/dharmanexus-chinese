['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142a28_9']	此四總說如其次第，以緣名義言及說道不可退轉智為自性，謂無退智緣能詮法名句文身立為第一，緣所詮義立為第二，緣方言詞立為第三，緣應正理無滯礙說及緣自在定慧二道立為第四。	此四總說如其次第，以緣名義言及說道不可退轉智為自性，謂無退智緣能詮法名句文身立為第一，緣所詮義立為第二，緣方言詞立為第三，緣應正理無滯礙說及緣自在定慧二道立為第四。	These four are said in general, in order, to take as their nature the cognition that is irreversible with regard to names, meanings, speech, and the path. That is to say, the first is established as taking as its object the collection of names, phrases, and syllables that express dharmas, the second is established as taking as its object the meanings that are expressed, the third is established as taking as its object the speech of the various regions, and the fourth is established as taking as its object the path of concentration and wisdom that is unobstructed and unimpeded in accordance with correct principles.

['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b03_2']	法無礙解通依五地，謂欲界、四靜慮，以於上地無名等故。	法無礙解通依五地，謂欲界、四靜慮，以於上地無名等故。	The unobstructed understanding of dharmas is based on five stages, namely the desire realm and the four meditations, because above these there are no names, etc.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b04_8']	詞無礙解唯依二地，謂欲界、初靜慮，以於上地無尋伺故。	詞無礙解唯依二地，謂欲界、初靜慮，以於上地無尋伺故。	The unobstructed understanding of expression is based only on two stages, namely the desire realm and the first meditation, because above these there is no applied thought or sustained thought.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b05_17']	義無礙解十六智攝，謂若諸法皆名為義，義無礙解則十智攝；	義無礙解十六智攝，謂若諸法皆名為義，義無礙解則十智攝；	The unobstructed understanding of meaning is included in sixteen knowledges. If all dharmas are called meaning, then the unobstructed understanding of meaning is included in ten knowledges.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b07_9']	若唯涅槃名為義者，義無礙解則六智攝，謂俗、法、類、滅盡、無生。	若唯涅槃名為義者，義無礙解則六智攝，謂俗、法、類、滅盡、無生。	If only nirvāṇa is called meaning, then the unobstructed understanding of meaning is included in six knowledges, namely conventional, knowledge of dharmas, subsequent, extinction, and non-production.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b08_6']	辯無礙解九智所攝，謂唯除滅，緣說道故。	辯無礙解九智所攝，謂唯除滅，緣說道故。	The unobstructed understanding of elocution is included in nine knowledges, excluding the knowledge of extinction, because it takes speech as its object.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b09_6']	此二通依一切地起，謂依欲界乃至有頂。	此二通依一切地起，謂依欲界乃至有頂。	These two are based on all stages, namely from the desire realm up to the peak of existence.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b10_6']	辯無礙解於說道中，許隨緣一皆得起故。	辯無礙解於說道中，許隨緣一皆得起故。	Because it is allowed that the unobstructed understanding of elocution arises in accordance with taking any one as its object in speech.

The knowledge of unobstructed expression and the path on which it is based is without retrogression. These are established in sequence as the names of the four unobstructed analytical knowledges of dharmas, meanings, etymological explanations, and inspired speech. For this reason, the four kinds of unobstructed analytical knowledge are established in this sequence.

['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b15_6']	詞謂一切訓釋言詞，如前說言有變礙故名為色等。	詞謂一切訓釋言詞，如前說言有變礙故名為色等。	ETymological explanations are all the terms used in etymological explanations, such as the statement above that is called form because it is capable of deformation.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b15_15']	辯謂展轉言無滯礙。	辯謂展轉言無滯礙。	Inspired speech is speech that is uninterrupted and unobstructed.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b18_6']	傳說此四無礙解生，如次串習算計佛語聲明因明為前加行，若於四處未得善巧必不能生無礙解故。	傳說此四無礙解生，如次串習算計佛語聲明因明為前加行，若於四處未得善巧必不能生無礙解故。	It is said that the four unobstructed analytical knowledges are born in sequence from the prior practices of calculation, the Buddha’s words, grammar, and logic. If one does not acquire skill in these four topics, one is certainly unable to generate the four unobstructed analytical knowledges.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b19_6']	理實一切無礙解生，唯學佛語能為加行。	理實一切無礙解生，唯學佛語能為加行。	In reality, the generation of all four unobstructed analytical knowledges is only the prior practice of studying the Buddha’s words.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b20_15']	如是四種無礙解中，隨得一時必具得四，非不具四可名為得。	如是四種無礙解中，隨得一時必具得四，非不具四可名為得。	Of these four kinds of unobstructed analytical knowledge, if one acquires one, one necessarily acquires all four, and it is not the case that one cannot be said to acquire them if one does not acquire all four.

Their species and the bodies on which they depend are like the absence of conflict.

['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b28_12']	邊際靜慮體有六種，前六除詞加餘邊際，詞無礙解雖依彼得而體非彼靜慮所收，邊際名但依第四靜慮故。	邊際靜慮體有六種，前六除詞加餘邊際，詞無礙解雖依彼得而體非彼靜慮所收，邊際名但依第四靜慮故。	The substance of ultimate samādhi is of six kinds. The first six are eliminated, and the rest are added to make ultimate. Although the unimpeded understanding of elocution is obtained through it, its substance is not included in samādhi, because the name ultimate is based only on the fourth trance state.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142b29_15']	此一切地遍所隨順故、增至究竟故，得邊際名。	此一切地遍所隨順故、增至究竟故，得邊際名。	It is called ultimate because it is universal and increases to the ultimate in all stages.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c01_5']	云何此名遍所隨順？	云何此名遍所隨順？	How is it called universal?
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c05_5']	謂正修學此靜慮時，從欲界心入初靜慮，次第順入乃至有頂，復從有頂入、無所有次第逆入乃至欲界，復從欲界次第順入，展轉乃至第四靜慮，名一切地遍所隨順。	謂正修學此靜慮時，從欲界心入初靜慮，次第順入乃至有頂，復從有頂入、無所有次第逆入乃至欲界，復從欲界次第順入，展轉乃至第四靜慮，名一切地遍所隨順。	That is, when one is cultivating this meditation, one enters the first meditation from the mind of the desire realm, and in order enters up to the peak of existence. Again, from the peak of existence one enters nothingness, and in reverse order enters down to the desire realm. Again, from the desire realm one enters in order, and in succession up to the fourth meditation. This is called “following in all stages.”
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c05_14']	云何此名增至究竟？	云何此名增至究竟？	What is meant by “increasing to the ultimate”?
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c08_5']	謂專修習第四靜慮，從下至中從中至上，如是三品復各分三，上上品生名至究竟，如是靜慮得邊際名。	謂專修習第四靜慮，從下至中從中至上，如是三品復各分三，上上品生名至究竟，如是靜慮得邊際名。	That is, one cultivates the fourth meditation exclusively, from the lower to the middle, and from the middle to the higher. Each of these three grades is divided into three again. The highest of the high grade is called “reaching the ultimate.” This meditation is called “reaching the limit.”
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c09_5']	此中邊名顯無越義，勝無越此故名為邊。	此中邊名顯無越義，勝無越此故名為邊。	Here, the term “limit” indicates the meaning of no transcendence. Because there is nothing superior to it, it is called a “limit.”
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c10_5']	際言為顯類義極義，如說四際及實際言。	際言為顯類義極義，如說四際及實際言。	The word “limit” is used to indicate the meaning of class and the ultimate, just as the words “four limits” and “actual limit” are used.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c11_14']	除佛，所餘一切聖者，所說六種唯加行得，非離染得，非皆得故。	除佛，所餘一切聖者，所說六種唯加行得，非離染得，非皆得故。	With the exception of the Buddha, all other sages acquire the six through exertion and not through detachment, because they do not acquire all.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c14_11']	唯佛於此亦離染得，諸佛功德初盡智時由離染故一切頓得，後時隨欲能引現前不由加行，以佛世尊於一切法自在轉故。	唯佛於此亦離染得，諸佛功德初盡智時由離染故一切頓得，後時隨欲能引現前不由加行，以佛世尊於一切法自在轉故。	Only the Buddha acquires them through detachment. The qualities of the Buddha are acquired all at once at the moment of the knowledge of destruction, through detachment. Later, he actualizes them at will, without effort, because the Buddha has mastery over all dharmas.

['ZH_T29_1558_027:0142c29_11']	解脫道言顯出障義。	解脫道言顯出障義。	The term “path of liberation” indicates the meaning of “free from obstacles.”
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0143a01_1']	神境等四唯俗智攝。	神境等四唯俗智攝。	The first four supernormal knowledges are categorized as conventional cognition.

['ZH_T29_1558_027:0143a02_11']	漏盡通如力說，謂或六或十智。	漏盡通如力說，謂或六或十智。	The supernormal knowledge of the extinction of contamination is as explained in the powers, that is, either six or ten kinds of cognition.

When accomplished, they are able to take as objects the nature of place, etc. There is no such ability in the formless realms.

Then they carefully observe the body and mind of another. Through these practices, they gradually attain accomplishment.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0143a11_1']	成已不觀自心諸色，於他心等能如實知。	成已不觀自心諸色，於他心等能如實知。	When accomplished, they do not observe their own mind and form, but are able to truly know the mind of another, etc.

This is called the accomplishment of the practice of one’s own past abodes.

['ZH_T29_1558_027:0143a18_1']	從無色歿來生此者，依他相續初起此通，所餘亦依自相續起。	從無色歿來生此者，依他相續初起此通，所餘亦依自相續起。	Those who die in the formless realm and are reborn here first produce this knowledge in dependence on the life stream of another, but subsequently they can produce it by themselves.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0143a19_11']	修神境等前三通時，思輕光聲以為加行，成已自在隨所應為。	修神境等前三通時，思輕光聲以為加行，成已自在隨所應為。	When one cultivates the first three supernormal knowledges of supernatural power, etc., one imagines lightness, light, and sound as the added efforts. Once they are accomplished, one is free to do as one wishes.
['ZH_T29_1558_027:0143a20_2']	故此五通不依無色。	故此五通不依無色。	Therefore these five supernormal knowledges do not depend on the formless realm.

The five supernormal knowledges must be based on a stage where calming and contemplation are balanced. This is already a refutation of the idea that they are based on the preliminary stages of trance, etc. The objects of these five supernormal knowledges are only in the lower stages.

That is, when one emerges from the pure trance state, the first mind of emanation is born. After that, subsequent minds of emanation are born from their own species. Prior moments of the mind of emanation generate minds of their own species. The final mind of emanation generates the pure trance state.
