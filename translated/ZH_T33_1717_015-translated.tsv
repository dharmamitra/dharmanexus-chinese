['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a15_0']	釋此本門十妙，於中自二：先本迹，次十妙。	釋此本門十妙，於中自二：先本迹，次十妙。	Explaining the ten mysteries of this chapter on the origin has two parts: first, the original and traces, next, the ten mysteries.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a16_18']	所以先明本迹者，以本迹名通，故須通辨。	所以先明本迹者，以本迹名通，故須通辨。	The reason for first clarifying the original and traces is that the names of the original and traces are common, so it is necessary to distinguish them in a general way.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a18_11']	簡通從別，使今本迹昭然可觀，是故於中先通論本迹，次別論本迹。	簡通從別，使今本迹昭然可觀，是故於中先通論本迹，次別論本迹。	Distinguishing the common and taking the specific, making the original and traces of now clearly visible, therefore, in the middle first generally discussing the original and traces, next specifically discussing the original and traces.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a20_1']	初中言「事理」者，秖是真俗。	初中言「事理」者，秖是真俗。	In the beginning, principle and phenomena are just true and conventional.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a20_21']	「理教」者，真俗是理，說此真俗名之為教。	「理教」者，真俗是理，說此真俗名之為教。	Principle and teaching means that true and conventional are principle, speaking of this true and conventional is called teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a21_6']	教行等，可解。	教行等，可解。	Teaching, practice, etc., are understandable.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a21_13']	次釋中且為二：	次釋中且為二：	Next, the explanation is roughly divided into two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a22_4']	先釋，次「若約下」結攝。	先釋，次「若約下」結攝。	First, the explanation, next, If it is about... concluding and encompassing.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a23_1']	初文自六，一一文中皆簡通以出別。	初文自六，一一文中皆簡通以出別。	The initial text has six parts, each part distinguishes the common to bring out the specific.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920a24_10']	又一一文皆三，謂先釋本迹相，次明本迹相顯理融，三引文證。	又一一文皆三，謂先釋本迹相，次明本迹相顯理融，三引文證。	Moreover, each text has three parts: first, explaining the characteristics of the original and the trace; next, clarifying the principle of the fusion of the characteristics of the original and the trace; third, citing the text as evidence.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b02_2']	初理事中云「從無住本立一切法」者，無明為一切法作本，無明即法性，無明復以法性為本，當知諸法亦以法性為本，法性即無明，法性復以無明為本，法性即無明，法性無住處，無明即法性，無明無住處，無明法性雖皆無住，而與一切諸法為本，故云「從無住本立一切法」。	初理事中云「從無住本立一切法」者，無明為一切法作本，無明即法性，無明復以法性為本，當知諸法亦以法性為本，法性即無明，法性復以無明為本，法性即無明，法性無住處，無明即法性，無明無住處，無明法性雖皆無住，而與一切諸法為本，故云「從無住本立一切法」。	In the first part on principle and phenomena, it says all dharmas are established based on the unconditioned. Ignorance serves as the basis for all dharmas. Ignorance is precisely the nature of dharmas. Ignorance also takes the nature of dharmas as its basis. One should know that all dharmas also take the nature of dharmas as their basis. The nature of dharmas is precisely ignorance. The nature of dharmas also takes ignorance as its basis. The nature of dharmas is precisely ignorance. The nature of dharmas has no abode. Ignorance is precisely the nature of dharmas. Ignorance has no abode. Although the nature of dharmas and ignorance both have no abode, they serve as the basis for all dharmas. Therefore, it is said that all dharmas are established based on the unconditioned.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b02_17']	無住之本既通，是故真諦指理也；	無住之本既通，是故真諦指理也；	Since the unconditioned basis is common, therefore the ultimate truth points to principle;
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b03_12']	一切諸法事也，即指三千為其森羅。	一切諸法事也，即指三千為其森羅。	all dharmas are phenomena, which precisely point to the myriad phenomena as their myriad images.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b05_10']	言「從本垂迹」者，此理性之本迹，由此方有外用本迹，是故始從理事終乎已今。	言「從本垂迹」者，此理性之本迹，由此方有外用本迹，是故始從理事終乎已今。	As for from the root to the traces, this is the root and traces of the principle of reality. Based on this, there are the root and traces of external functions. Therefore, it begins with principle and phenomena and ends with the present.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b08_1']	六重本迹，前之五重通已通今通本通迹，恐濫迹，故於一一重顯了釋云，本時實相乃至最初實得實相。	六重本迹，前之五重通已通今通本通迹，恐濫迹，故於一一重顯了釋云，本時實相乃至最初實得實相。	The six layers of root and traces, the first five layers are common to the past, the present, the root, and the traces. Fearing confusion with the traces, in each layer, it is clearly explained, saying the true aspect at the time of the root and so on, up to the true attainment of the true aspect at the very beginning.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b09_10']	又以第六已今一重，判前五重有本有迹，驗知前五皆屬於本。	又以第六已今一重，判前五重有本有迹，驗知前五皆屬於本。	Moreover, the sixth layer of the present and the past divides the first five layers into root and traces. It can be verified that the first five all belong to the root.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b11_4']	又六重末相顯理融中皆云「本迹雖殊不思議一」者，借肇公言歎本迹理。	又六重末相顯理融中皆云「本迹雖殊不思議一」者，借肇公言歎本迹理。	Moreover, in the end of the six layers, the manifestation of the principle of fusion all says although the root and traces are different, the inconceivable is one. This borrows the words of Master ZHI to praise the principle of root and traces.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b12_4']	肇公雖有本迹之言，本之與迹皆屬於迹。	肇公雖有本迹之言，本之與迹皆屬於迹。	Although Master ZHI has the words of root and traces, both the root and the traces belong to the traces.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b13_18']	今言不思議者，約事則本昔迹今，約理則無復今昔，故知理體皆不思議。	今言不思議者，約事則本昔迹今，約理則無復今昔，故知理體皆不思議。	Now, the inconceivable refers to the root in the past and the traces in the present in terms of phenomena. In terms of principle, there is no more past or present. Therefore, it is known that the substance of principle is all inconceivable.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b16_13']	若約今之五重本迹準義說者，約事則有本中事理、迹中事理，約理則無復本迹事理之殊，是故皆云「不思議一」。	若約今之五重本迹準義說者，約事則有本中事理、迹中事理，約理則無復本迹事理之殊，是故皆云「不思議一」。	If we discuss the five levels of the original and trace according to the meaning, in terms of events there are the events and principles in the original and the events and principles in the traces, but in terms of principle there is no longer a distinction between the original and traces in terms of events and principles. Therefore, they are all called inconceivable oneness.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b17_1']	乃至餘四亦復如是。	乃至餘四亦復如是。	This is also the case for the remaining four.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b18_1']	第六已今，「已」即是迹，即指迹門及諸迹教；	第六已今，「已」即是迹，即指迹門及諸迹教；	The sixth, past and present, past refers to the traces, which refers to the traces chapter and all the teachings of the traces;
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b20_7']	「今」即是本，即指本門，本門已前皆名為已，涌出已後方名為今，故云已說事理乃至權實名之為迹。	「今」即是本，即指本門，本門已前皆名為已，涌出已後方名為今，故云已說事理乃至權實名之為迹。	Present refers to the origin, which refers to the origin chapter. Before the origin chapter, it is all called the past, and after the emergence, it is called the present. Therefore, it says that the events and principles, up to the provisional and real, of the past are called traces.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b22_6']	今說事理乃至權實皆名為本，故知若無迹中事理乃至權實，何能顯於長遠之本？	今說事理乃至權實皆名為本，故知若無迹中事理乃至權實，何能顯於長遠之本？	The events and principles, up to the provisional and real, of the present are all called the origin. Therefore, we know that if there were no events and principles, up to the provisional and real, in the traces, how could it manifest the distant origin?
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b23_12']	又已今之言雖異前五，亦是一往指於壽量，名為今本。	又已今之言雖異前五，亦是一往指於壽量，名為今本。	Moreover, although the words past and present differ from the previous five, they also point to the life span in one direction, which is called the present origin.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b24_7']	若望初本則應又簡已今不同。	若望初本則應又簡已今不同。	If compared to the original beginning, it should also distinguish the past and present as being different.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b26_17']	法華已前諸經已今仍屬於迹，今經所明乃是真明久遠之本，即是已說已今為迹，今說已今為本，方是實說。	法華已前諸經已今仍屬於迹，今經所明乃是真明久遠之本，即是已說已今為迹，今說已今為本，方是實說。	Before the Lotus Sūtra, the teachings of other sūtras, whether past or present, are still considered to be provisional. The teachings revealed in this sūtra are the true revelation of the distant original beginning. The past and present teachings are considered to be provisional, while the present and future teachings are considered to be the true teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920b27_19']	所以六門引證之文，前三引迹、後三引本者何？	所以六門引證之文，前三引迹、後三引本者何？	Why are the six gates of scriptural evidence, the first three citing the provisional and the last three citing the real?
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c02_14']	然前三復通本之與迹，俱有事理乃至教行、體用等三，通中復別，既云本用本權，非迹文能顯，況以本門為今，灼然不可引迹，為是義故，三引迹文、三引本文。	然前三復通本之與迹，俱有事理乃至教行、體用等三，通中復別，既云本用本權，非迹文能顯，況以本門為今，灼然不可引迹，為是義故，三引迹文、三引本文。	However, the first three are also common to both the provisional and the real, and they all have principles and phenomena, up to teachings and practices, essence and function, and so on. The common also has distinctions. Since it is said that the original function and original expedient means are not revealed by the provisional texts, let alone using the real gate as the present, it is absolutely not acceptable to cite the provisional as the real. For this reason, three texts cite the provisional and three cite the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c04_4']	又前之三文，既在於因，本因狹故，但以迹倒本，故但引迹門。	又前之三文，既在於因，本因狹故，但以迹倒本，故但引迹門。	Moreover, the first three texts are already in the cause, and the original cause is narrow, so they only use the provisional to overturn the real, so they only cite the provisional gate.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c07_12']	次結攝中，言「若約已今論本迹者」去至「不思議」，是却明前來五重本迹，以攝十妙有本有迹，別約今經本門所明十麁十妙，方乃名本乃名本妙。	次結攝中，言「若約已今論本迹者」去至「不思議」，是却明前來五重本迹，以攝十妙有本有迹，別約今經本門所明十麁十妙，方乃名本乃名本妙。	Next, in the conclusion, it says If discussing the original and traces in terms of the past and present... up to inconceivable, which clarifies the five layers of original and traces that have come before, and includes the ten wondrous principles that have original and traces. Specifically, it is only in the chapter on the origin of the present sutra that the ten coarsenesses and ten wondrous principles are clarified, and only then are they called the original and wondrous.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c09_1']	又將六重望於十妙，有全有缺、有多有少，故重明之。	又將六重望於十妙，有全有缺、有多有少，故重明之。	Moreover, comparing the six layers to the ten wondrous principles, there are complete and incomplete, many and few, and therefore they are clarified again.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c09_6']	於中為三：	於中為三：	In this, there are three parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c10_12']	初正明相攝，次「最初」下簡示，三「若無」下總明相顯理融。	初正明相攝，次「最初」下簡示，三「若無」下總明相顯理融。	First, directly clarifying the mutual inclusion; second, distinguishing and demonstrating from The first... below; third, generally clarifying the mutual manifestation and fusion from If there is no... below.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c12_2']	初文乘便，六雙之中從後逆識，若識已今，即知餘五，故逆次釋也。	初文乘便，六雙之中從後逆識，若識已今，即知餘五，故逆次釋也。	The first text takes advantage of the situation, and among the six pairs, it recognizes the reverse order from the end. If one recognizes the past and present, then one knows the remaining five, and therefore it is explained in reverse order.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c14_2']	所以六門明攝不同者，以六門中三因二果，已今復是今經二門，是故隨義所攝不同。	所以六門明攝不同者，以六門中三因二果，已今復是今經二門，是故隨義所攝不同。	The reason why the six gates clarify the mutual inclusion differently is because among the six gates, the three causes and two fruits are already present and are also the two gates of the present sutra, and therefore the mutual inclusion is different according to the meaning.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c15_16']	次簡示中云「最初之本但本而非迹」等者，最初實成既未垂迹，故唯屬本。	次簡示中云「最初之本但本而非迹」等者，最初實成既未垂迹，故唯屬本。	Next, in the section on distinguishing and revealing, it says The original of the very beginning is only the origin and not the trace and so on. The initial true accomplishment has not yet manifested traces, so it is only classified as the origin.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c16_7']	中間相望，互為本迹。	中間相望，互為本迹。	In the middle, they mutually serve as the origin and traces.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c17_11']	又中間所成，垂迹之時名為亦迹，顯本之時名為亦本。	又中間所成，垂迹之時名為亦迹，顯本之時名為亦本。	Moreover, the accomplishment in the middle, when manifesting traces, is called the trace; when revealing the origin, it is called the origin.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c20_1']	最後已說，即是今日已說迹門，未顯本時，故唯屬迹，若無已說，即舉今日迹門，今說之本即舉今日本門。	最後已說，即是今日已說迹門，未顯本時，故唯屬迹，若無已說，即舉今日迹門，今說之本即舉今日本門。	The final has already been spoken of, which is the trace gate that has already been spoken of today. When the origin has not yet been revealed, it is only classified as the trace. If there has not yet been spoken of, then it refers to the trace gate of today. The origin that is now being spoken of refers to the origin gate of today.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c21_8']	○次正明本迹中二：	○次正明本迹中二：	Next, in the section on correctly clarifying the origin and traces, there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c21_14']	先列，次釋。	先列，次釋。	First, listing; second, explanation.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c22_9']	釋中文中自為十重，釋此十妙。	釋中文中自為十重，釋此十妙。	In the text of the explanation, there are ten layers, explaining these ten wonders.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c23_10']	初略釋中自為十重，於初文稍廣，餘九文略。	初略釋中自為十重，於初文稍廣，餘九文略。	In the first brief explanation, there are ten layers. The first text is somewhat extensive, while the remaining nine texts are brief.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c23_14']	初文三：	初文三：	The first text has three parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0920c24_21', 'ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a01_13']	初舉本，次「若十六」下舉迹比決，三「若留」下拂迹顯本。🔽迹文中云「娑婆為墨」至「寧當得盡」者，此引迹門〈化城品〉文，不合引於彌勒等言，彌勒不知文在本門，或是借於本中之文，來此況喻，假使迹中三千塵點補處智力亦不能知，若定用迹文，則應除彌勒等二十五字義理即順，師云「恐別有意」。	初舉本，次「若十六」下舉迹比決，三「若留」下拂迹顯本。 迹文中云「娑婆為墨」至「寧當得盡」者，此引迹門〈化城品〉文，不合引於彌勒等言，彌勒不知文在本門，或是借於本中之文，來此況喻，假使迹中三千塵點補處智力亦不能知，若定用迹文，則應除彌勒等二十五字義理即順，師云「恐別有意」。	First, he cites the original, next, below If the sixteen he cites the traces to compare and decide, and third, below If left he brushes aside the traces to reveal the original.🔽In the section on traces, it says to make the saha world into ink up to how could it be possible to know the number of dust motes? This cites the text of the chapter on the illusory city in the traces section, but it does not agree to cite the words of Maitreya and others. Maitreya does not know the text is in the original section. Either this is borrowing the text from the original section to come here as a simile,假使假 supposing, if in the traces section the wisdom power of the one who will fill the position of the Buddha in the three thousand dust motes is also unable to know, if definitely using the text of the traces, then it should remove the twenty-five characters of Maitreya and so on, and the meaning and principle will be in accord. The teacher says I'm afraid there is another meaning.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a04_10']	然雖引彌勒語勢稍殊，彼本門文但云「我等住阿惟越致地，於是事中亦所不達」，今此文中以出假智數世界不知，況其塵數？	然雖引彌勒語勢稍殊，彼本門文但云「我等住阿惟越致地，於是事中亦所不達」，今此文中以出假智數世界不知，況其塵數？	Although it cites the words of Maitreya, the tone is slightly different. The text of the original section only says We abide in the stage of nonretrogression, and within this matter we also do not understand. In this text, it uses the wisdom of leaving the world to count the worlds and does not know, let alone the number of dust motes?
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a05_6']	若取知塵，秖應合用出假智耳。	若取知塵，秖應合用出假智耳。	If one grasps the dust, one should only apply the wisdom of emerging from the provisional.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a05_15']	是故應用前文說也。	是故應用前文說也。	Therefore, one should apply the previous text.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a07_18']	言「拂迹顯本」者，但指若干塵數已前成佛，則中間今日任運被拂，久遠之本任運可見。	言「拂迹顯本」者，但指若干塵數已前成佛，則中間今日任運被拂，久遠之本任運可見。	As for wiping away traces to reveal the fundamental, it only points to the Buddhahood attained before the dust particles, and then the present traces are naturally wiped away, and the distant fundamental can be naturally seen.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a08_8']	下去九妙例皆如是。	下去九妙例皆如是。	The remaining nine wonders are all similar to this.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a10_16']	此下本果本國二妙，唯有二文立妙及拂迹顯本，下之七妙直爾指本，下更廣釋，故此未論，文並可見。	此下本果本國二妙，唯有二文立妙及拂迹顯本，下之七妙直爾指本，下更廣釋，故此未論，文並可見。	Below this, the two wonders of the fundamental fruition and the fundamental land only have two texts to establish the wonder and wipe away traces to reveal the fundamental. The remaining seven wonders directly point to the fundamental. They will be further explained below, so they are not discussed here. The texts can all be seen.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a16_7']	先明迹中因開果合，次明感應等不開不合，三「本開」下明本中因合而果開，四利益一亦同感應等意。	先明迹中因開果合，次明感應等不開不合，三「本開」下明本中因合而果開，四利益一亦同感應等意。	First, it clarifies that in the traces, the cause is opened and the effect is combined. Next, it clarifies that the stimulus, response, etc. are neither opened nor combined. Third, below The origin is opened, it clarifies that in the origin, the cause is combined and the effect is opened. The benefit is also the same as the meaning of stimulus, response, etc.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a18_1']	初文迹中離因為四，合果中壽命涅槃為一三法，合此本門涅槃壽命。	初文迹中離因為四，合果中壽命涅槃為一三法，合此本門涅槃壽命。	In the first text, the traces are separated into four causes, and the effect is combined into one of longevity and nirvana. This combines the nirvana of the present chapter with longevity.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a19_2']	次感應等本迹俱有二處名同，同是果上之用。	次感應等本迹俱有二處名同，同是果上之用。	Next, the stimulus, response, etc. are both in the origin and traces, and the two places are called the same. They are both the function above the effect.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0921a21_10']	三明本中因合如前，但明果開，迹中無果名，即成離三法以為果等三，本中有果名，故但云「離二」。	三明本中因合如前，但明果開，迹中無果名，即成離三法以為果等三，本中有果名，故但云「離二」。	Third, it clarifies that in the origin, the cause is combined as before, but only the effect is opened.

The sky on both sides symbolizes the eternally quiescent and illuminated.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922a20_5']	「寂光理通如鏡如器」等者，譬如諸天共寶器食，如《止觀》第三記。	「寂光理通如鏡如器」等者，譬如諸天共寶器食，如《止觀》第三記。	The principle of the eternally quiescent and illuminated is like a mirror, like a vessel, etc. is like the gods eating from a jeweled vessel together, as recorded in the third chapter of the Mohe Zhiguan.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922a24_14']	「三變土田或見同居淨」乃至「方便有餘」者，三變之淨若據土相似同居淨，據移天人置於他土純諸寶樹寶獅子座，唯有諸佛及諸菩薩，則似方便有餘，故著「或」言，準文又應亦似實報無障礙土。	「三變土田或見同居淨」乃至「方便有餘」者，三變之淨若據土相似同居淨，據移天人置於他土純諸寶樹寶獅子座，唯有諸佛及諸菩薩，則似方便有餘，故著「或」言，準文又應亦似實報無障礙土。	The three transformations of the land may be seen as pure in the same dwelling place up to the remainder of skillful means means that if the purity of the three transformations is based on the similar dwelling place, based on moving the celestials and humans to other lands, with only various jeweled trees and jeweled lion seats, then it resembles the remainder of skillful means, so the word or is used. According to the text, it should also resemble the unobstructed land of true recompense.

It says the Buddha of the Tripiṭaka canon illuminates the potential of sentient beings three times a day and below, the Shared Teaching all says illuminating the nine dharma realms, because each teaching has the three vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922b03_5']	三藏中「又如大論等云佛入城乞食」者，為女人父母所遮不得出故、為病者故、為欲令人見相好故、為本無施心待乞方施者故，如是有十因緣，並三藏物觀機益物之相。	三藏中「又如大論等云佛入城乞食」者，為女人父母所遮不得出故、為病者故、為欲令人見相好故、為本無施心待乞方施者故，如是有十因緣，並三藏物觀機益物之相。	In the Tripiṭaka, it says it is also like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra, which states that the Buddha entered the city to beg for food - because women were prevented by their parents from going out, because of the sick, because he wanted people to see his excellent characteristics, because those who originally had no intention to give would only give when begged, there are ten such causes and conditions, all of which are the characteristics of the Tripiṭaka's observation of the capacities of beings and benefiting them.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922b05_18']	次分別中云「復次本感迹感麁妙相對四句」者，本文遠指最初，實得之時所被機緣亦有四教，則三教為麁，圓教為妙。	次分別中云「復次本感迹感麁妙相對四句」者，本文遠指最初，實得之時所被機緣亦有四教，則三教為麁，圓教為妙。	Next, in the distinctions, it says Furthermore, the original inspiration and the traces of inspiration are roughly contrasted in four statements - the main text refers to the initial, true attainment from afar, and the capacities of beings that were reached also have the four teachings, then the three teachings are coarse, and the perfect teaching is subtle.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922b06_13']	迹中被機亦不出四，麁妙亦爾。	迹中被機亦不出四，麁妙亦爾。	The capacities of beings reached in the traces also do not go beyond the four, and the coarse and subtle are also like this.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922b08_19']	故今不從麁妙以判本迹，但從最初名之為本，當知本時麁妙俱妙，迹中麁妙俱麁，廣狹可知。	故今不從麁妙以判本迹，但從最初名之為本，當知本時麁妙俱妙，迹中麁妙俱麁，廣狹可知。	Therefore, now it is not judged based on coarse and subtle to distinguish the original and traces, but only from the initial it is called the original. One should know that at the original time, the coarse and subtle are both subtle, and in the traces, the coarse and subtle are both coarse, and the extensive and narrow can be known.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922b09_8']	應中四句麁妙如文。	應中四句麁妙如文。	In the four statements of response, the coarse and subtle are as in the text.

The initial hanging down and the middle are also vast and narrow. Now it is also not determined by vastness and narrowness. Therefore, it is known that the long-established vastness and narrowness are both wonderful, and the middle and today's vastness and narrowness are both coarse.

The four phrases of the broad and narrow of the original and traces are also like this.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922b26_18']	「若是乳牛不食酒糟酒真麥分，糟俗󱆄別其犢調善不馳空不驟有放牧之處，不在高原涅槃亦不下濕生死，飲以清水非欲濁也不令馳走不見散也，不與特牛同共一群佛不共法，飲食調適不飢空、不飽俗，如是乳者名為甘露祕密藏也。	「若是乳牛不食酒糟酒真麥分，糟俗󱆄別其犢調善不馳空不驟有放牧之處，不在高原涅槃亦不下濕生死，飲以清水非欲濁也不令馳走不見散也，不與特牛同共一群佛不共法，飲食調適不飢空、不飽俗，如是乳者名為甘露祕密藏也。	If this milk cow does not eat wine dregs, wine, barley dregs, or wheat dregs, the calf is well-behaved and does not run in the empty or gallop in existence. The place where it is let out to graze is not on high plateaus or in the low wetness of birth and death. It drinks clear water, not wanting to be turbid or not allowing it to run around and scatter. It is not allowed to be in the same herd as a special cow, the Buddha does not share the Dharma. Eating and drinking are moderate, not hungry or full. Such milk is called the secret treasury of ambrosia.

From Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara up to those with doubts not yet understood, the different characteristics in the traces are briefly brought out. The characteristics of the sages listed in the various chapters can also be used as the four different characteristics.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922c18_4']	初言「法性虛空之寂光」者，即以下方及塔在此方虛空表寂光也。	初言「法性虛空之寂光」者，即以下方及塔在此方虛空表寂光也。	As for the phrase the tranquil light of the Dharma-nature of empty space, it means that the lower direction and the stupa are in the empty space of this realm, which represents the tranquil light.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922c20_12']	此諸菩薩住下方虛空，湧出已後亦住虛空，此土得聞開權顯實得無生忍者，亦住虛空之寂光也。	此諸菩薩住下方虛空，湧出已後亦住虛空，此土得聞開權顯實得無生忍者，亦住虛空之寂光也。	These bodhisattvas dwell in the empty space below, and after emerging, they also dwell in the empty space. Those in this realm who hear the disclosure of the provisional and the revelation of the real and attain the forbearance of non-arising also dwell in the tranquil light of empty space.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922c22_16']	雖俱虛空以表寂光，能住之人不無久近，涌出菩薩得忍已久，是故迹中始近入者不識久者。	雖俱虛空以表寂光，能住之人不無久近，涌出菩薩得忍已久，是故迹中始近入者不識久者。	Although both are empty space to represent the tranquil light, there is a difference in the length of time the dwellers have been there. The bodhisattvas who emerged and attained forbearance have been there for a long time, so those who have recently approached in the traces do not recognize those who have been there for a long time.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922c26_14']	次迹中文云「文殊觀音或為師為弟子」者，文殊昔為妙光菩薩教化燈明八王子，是八王子相次授記，其最後者名曰然燈，然燈既是釋迦之師，妙光乃成釋迦九代祖師。	次迹中文云「文殊觀音或為師為弟子」者，文殊昔為妙光菩薩教化燈明八王子，是八王子相次授記，其最後者名曰然燈，然燈既是釋迦之師，妙光乃成釋迦九代祖師。	Next, in the text on the traces, it says Manjushri and Avalokitesvara may be teachers or disciples. Manjushri was formerly the bodhisattva Wonderful Light who taught and transformed the eight princes of Lamp Light. These eight princes succeeded each other in receiving predictions. The last one was named Lamp Lighter. Lamp Lighter was Shakyamuni's teacher, and Wonderful Light became Shakyamuni's ninth generation ancestor teacher.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0922c29_1']	《觀音經》中釋迦過去於正法明如來所學習道法，正法明如來即觀音本身，故知文殊、觀音並曾為師。	《觀音經》中釋迦過去於正法明如來所學習道法，正法明如來即觀音本身，故知文殊、觀音並曾為師。	In the Avalokiteśvara Sūtra, it is said that Śākyamuni in the past studied the Way under the Tathāgata Samantaprabhāsa. The Tathāgata Samantaprabhāsa is the original body of Avalokiteśvara. Therefore, we know that Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara were both teachers in the past.

If compared to the retinue in the traces of the present time, such as in the chapter on Distinguishing Merits, increasing understanding and reducing birth, the first group of sentient beings as numerous as the sands of six hundred and eighty million nayutas of Ganges Rivers attained the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas, and a thousand times more attained the ability to hear and retain. The dust in one world attained eloquence, the dust in a great trichiliocosm attained irreversibility, the dust in the medium and small trichiliocosms, up to one four-continent world and the eight directions, and those who initially gave rise to the aspiration for enlightenment were compared to those who emerged from the ground, and those who emerged from the ground were very few.

According to the Commentary on the Vimalakirti Sutra, it should be made into four statements, namely, the original is below and the traces are high, the original and traces are both below, the initial abode only has these two statements.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0924a19_16']	夫論迹者約有本說，本為法身、迹為八相，初住之前無法身本，故不得論本高迹下，仍有過上，又不得論本迹俱高。	夫論迹者約有本說，本為法身、迹為八相，初住之前無法身本，故不得論本高迹下，仍有過上，又不得論本迹俱高。	As for discussing the traces, it is based on having an original. The original is the Dharma body and the traces are the eight appearances. Before the initial abode, there is no original of the Dharma body, so it cannot discuss the original being high and the traces being below. It still has a surpassing, and it also cannot discuss the original and traces both being high.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0924a22_1']	若本迹俱高及本高迹下，妙覺唯得此之二句，妙覺極位更無過上，故無本下迹高及本迹俱下。	若本迹俱高及本高迹下，妙覺唯得此之二句，妙覺極位更無過上，故無本下迹高及本迹俱下。	If both the original and trace are lofty, or if the original is lofty and the trace is low, only the wondrous enlightenment attains these two phrases. The ultimate position of wondrous enlightenment has nothing higher, so there is no original low and trace high, or both original and trace low.

The trace manifestation of the second abode as the first abode, the first abode being the trace, is original lofty and trace low. The second abode manifesting as the third abode, the third abode being the trace, is original low and trace high. The second abode manifesting as the second abode, compared to the first abode, is original and trace both lofty. Compared to the third abode, it is original and trace both low.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0924a28_1']	今文正當本下迹高，若云初住之前竪無所指，以體為本、以用為迹，此本迹俱下句也。	今文正當本下迹高，若云初住之前竪無所指，以體為本、以用為迹，此本迹俱下句也。	The present text is precisely original low and trace high. If it is said that before the first abode there is no vertical indication, taking the essence as the original and the function as the trace, this is the phrase of both original and trace being low.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0924a28_15']	若準此意，一切諸佛皆悉顯本。	若準此意，一切諸佛皆悉顯本。	If this meaning is followed, all buddhas fully reveal the original.

The actual lifespan in the first stage is also immeasurable. Therefore, it is said that the lifespan is spoken of by making vows. One who attains the Dharma body will definitely attain long life. When conditions are ripe, it is said that the vow from the past is fulfilled.

This is a statement of the original and traces both being lofty, lacking only the statement of the original being lofty and the traces being low.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0924b07_10']	問中云「五佛章云何」者，如〈方便品〉廣開顯中約五佛章皆云亦以無量乃至皆為一佛乘故，若爾一切諸佛無不開顯。	問中云「五佛章云何」者，如〈方便品〉廣開顯中約五佛章皆云亦以無量乃至皆為一佛乘故，若爾一切諸佛無不開顯。	The question says, How is it in the chapter on the five Buddhas? It is like in the chapter on skillful means, in the extensive revelation of the true aspect, it is said about the chapter on the five Buddhas that they also use immeasurable... and all for the sake of the one Buddha vehicle. If that is so, then all Buddhas without exception reveal the true aspect.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0924b10_17']	「又問若爾還以妙破妙至例亦應妙」者，前文既以本妙破於迹妙，迹妙成麁。	「又問若爾還以妙破妙至例亦應妙」者，前文既以本妙破於迹妙，迹妙成麁。	If it is so, then the wonderful is used to break the wonderful, and by analogy it should also be wonderful. In the previous text, since the original wonderful is used to break the trace wonderful, the trace wonderful becomes coarse.

If it is based on the meaning of sudden enlightenment, the four abodes are precisely wonderful, and it should be as the question asked.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0924b20_1']	權即是偏亦可悉皆稱為偏耶？	權即是偏亦可悉皆稱為偏耶？	Are the expedient and the biased the same, or can they all be called biased?

The Dharma is already determined to be biased and perfect in the present and in the traces. The teaching is not so. In the present, both expedient and real are present. The present is therefore real. In the traces, both expedient and real are traces. The traces are therefore called expedient. The biased and perfect, up to the essence and function are also like this.

It cannot be that in the present, the essence and function are called essence, and in the traces, the essence and function are both function.

How can one know that the wondrous in the traces is not as good as the coarse in the original? Because it is not distinguished based on revealing, waiting, and cutting off, but is only discussed based on the true accomplishment of the distant past. Therefore, the coarse and wondrous in the middle and today are all not attained first.

Initially wanting to abandon it, therefore this provisional is reprimanded as not being ultimate. The provisional is the Dharma of phenomena, and people easily understand it, so the Buddha's intention has always been real before the Lotus Sūtra. The two vehicles do not regress and do not know from beginning to end. When the provisional is finally abandoned, it is said, The treasure place is near you, past and future, and everyone knows that the treasure place is not here. This is precisely at the beginning of the treasure island, having already set out on the long road. How much more so for having already traveled three hundred leagues? Pointing to my fruition is precisely their wondrous cause, therefore it is said to be easy to fathom.

The Tathāgata has long ago established expedient means for sentient beings, so the teachings of the Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges have all been abandoned. The expedient teachings are matters and characteristics, so these matters and characteristics are often taught for those who have attained irreversibility, who can understand the principle of irreversibility within matters.

If it is the stage of practice irreversibility before the grounds, one only hears the many matters and knows that matters are principle, so by revealing the expedient teachings and manifesting the true reality one enters the stage of irreversibility of mindfulness at the first ground, and can understand that these expedient teachings are precisely the true reality. How can one leave this and separately seek the true reality?

Therefore, the revelation of the three is the perfect, and the four is the supreme flavor.

In the previous extensive explanation of the ten, each is explained with three meanings. The meaning of the different ways of attaining Buddhahood recently is equivalent to the coarse, the meaning of brushing aside the traces and pointing to the origin is the same as the wonderful. Based on this, it is already a division of the disclosure based on events. Each also says it is inconceivable, and this again uses principle to disclose everything. Fearing people will not understand, it further establishes two gates to divide the coarse and wonderful of the past.

All at once, both can be called permanent. If they are rebuked, there is only impermanence and no permanence. The Lesser Vehicle also has three unconditioned dharmas that are permanent. If compared to the Great Vehicle, according to the Ratnasaṃbhāvatantra, the Two Vehicles are still the inverted views of impermanence, etc. The names are the same all at once, but the principles are different, so they are rebuked. Both say not attaining the wonderful because the all-at-once name is wonderful, and the rebuke is impermanent, so both say since it is impermanent, it is also not wonderful.

Since there is the permanence of the three unconditioned dharmas, and it is said that permanence is different, in the granting, it is again denied, so it says different.

Wisdom includes arising and ceasing, non-arising, immeasurable, and formless, let alone the sequential, non-sequential, and increased numbers, up to revealing the one mind and five practices that encompass all dharmas.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c14_1']	第四意者，見者得入初歡喜地八相成佛，此無作慧仍未終極。	第四意者，見者得入初歡喜地八相成佛，此無作慧仍未終極。	The fourth meaning sees that one who sees it can enter the first stage of joy and attain Buddhahood in the eight aspects, but this unconditioned wisdom has not yet reached its ultimate.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c16_10']	第六意者，明權實不二但是理體，亦是戒聖行前之理體耳。	第六意者，明權實不二但是理體，亦是戒聖行前之理體耳。	The sixth meaning clarifies that the non-duality of skillful means and truth is only the essence of principle, which is also only the essence of principle before the holy practice of precepts.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c17_16']	第七意者，云因必含果，果既未現，猶在地前無量行中。	第七意者，云因必含果，果既未現，猶在地前無量行中。	The seventh meaning says that the cause must contain the fruit, but since the fruit has not yet manifested, it is still within the immeasurable practices before the stages.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c19_1']	第八意者，鈍根菩薩及二乘人猶屬緣因福德所攝。	第八意者，鈍根菩薩及二乘人猶屬緣因福德所攝。	The eighth meaning is that dull-faculty bodhisattvas and those of the two vehicles are still included in the blessings and virtues of the conditional cause.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c20_15']	第九意者，託生處通猶兼方便，脩入華臺，終未圓極，故是無作聖行未終。	第九意者，託生處通猶兼方便，脩入華臺，終未圓極，故是無作聖行未終。	The ninth meaning, relying on the place of rebirth, still involves expedient means, and although one cultivates and enters the Flower Treasury, it is still not perfect and ultimate, so it is the unconditioned holy practice that has not yet ended.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c25_5']	第二意者，秖是開權大部法耳。	第二意者，秖是開權大部法耳。	The second meaning is that it is only the opening of the provisional and the great part of the Dharma.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c26_13']	第四意者，秖是廢權立實一意。	第四意者，秖是廢權立實一意。	The fourth meaning is that it is only the intention to abolish the provisional and establish the real.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0926c27_3']	第五意者，但是所詮。	第五意者，但是所詮。	The fifth meaning is that it is only what is expounded.

['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a05_1']	初列名如文。	初列名如文。	First, listing the names is as in the text.

Now, if one wishes to briefly understand the meaning of the Lotus Sutra Treatise's seventeen names, the sixteenth is already called Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower, so one should know that all the names are simply different names for the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a09_7']	又諸名者但法無喻，唯今妙法法喻雙舉，故知亦可用於蓮華喻十六名。	又諸名者但法無喻，唯今妙法法喻雙舉，故知亦可用於蓮華喻十六名。	Moreover, the various names only have the Dharma without metaphor, but now the wonderful Dharma raises both the Dharma and metaphor, so one should know that one can also use the lotus flower metaphor for the sixteen names.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a10_8']	如妙法者，本迹各三，無物以喻，故喻蓮華。	如妙法者，本迹各三，無物以喻，故喻蓮華。	Just as the wonderful Dharma has three aspects for both the original and the trace, there is no object that can be used as a metaphor, so it is metaphorized by the lotus flower.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a11_17']	餘十六名亦含本迹，各有三義，迹中諸經不譚佛意，故名有量。	餘十六名亦含本迹，各有三義，迹中諸經不譚佛意，故名有量。	The remaining sixteen names also contain the original and the trace, each with three meanings. The various sutras in the trace do not discuss the Buddha's intention, so they are called having measure.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a12_18']	今經本迹施開廢三，佛旨無盡，故云無量。	今經本迹施開廢三，佛旨無盡，故云無量。	The present sutra's original and trace bestow the open and abolish the three, the Buddha's purport is inexhaustible, so it is called immeasurable.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a13_12']	況成道後，處處開廢名無量義。	況成道後，處處開廢名無量義。	Moreover, after attaining the Way, it is opened and abolished everywhere, so the name has immeasurable meanings.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a14_12']	言「最勝」者，勝秖是妙，亦是歎美本迹之辭。	言「最勝」者，勝秖是妙，亦是歎美本迹之辭。	As for most excellent, excellent is simply wonderful, and it is also praise for the original and trace teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a15_12']	言「方等」者，亦曰廣平，迹本遍收故名為廣；	言「方等」者，亦曰廣平，迹本遍收故名為廣；	As for vaipulya, it is also called vast and even. Because it universally includes traces and origin, it is called vast;
['ZH_T33_1717_015:0927a16_3']	一實無二，故名為平。	一實無二，故名為平。	Because there is only one truth and no second, it is called even.
