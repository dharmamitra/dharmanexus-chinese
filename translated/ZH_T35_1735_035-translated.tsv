['ZH_T35_1735_035:0772c20_15']	非道即前非處，亦應以人況於餘類，以後後麁鄙於前前故。	非道即前非處，亦應以人況於餘類，以後後麁鄙於前前故。	The wrong path is the wrong place mentioned above. It should also use people to illustrate the other types, because the latter is coarser and more contemptible than the former.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0772c21_16']	以其婬境無想疑，故論主於此不約具緣。	以其婬境無想疑，故論主於此不約具緣。	Because the object of lust has no thought or doubt, the author of the treatise does not discuss it in terms of the complete conditions.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0772c23_17']	經文不言作他女想，約邪婬說，亦有想疑，為顯此中自妻正境亦定無犯，故不說也。	經文不言作他女想，約邪婬說，亦有想疑，為顯此中自妻正境亦定無犯，故不說也。	The text does not say to think of her as another's wife. It is said in terms of sexual misconduct. There is also thought and doubt. In order to show that there is definitely no offense even in the correct object of one's own wife, it is not discussed.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0772c24_5']	第四離妄語。	第四離妄語。	Fourth, abstaining from false speech.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0772c26_4']	今初對治，即是因離。	今初對治，即是因離。	Now, the first, counteracting, is abstaining through causes.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0772c29_11']	二無異因故，謂但用誑他，思心即妄語因，無別貪等以為異因。	二無異因故，謂但用誑他，思心即妄語因，無別貪等以為異因。	Second, there are no different causes, meaning that the mind of deception alone is the cause of false speech, and there are no other causes such as greed that are different.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a01_18']	異因即起因，故離彼誑心即成實語，實語即是誑心對治故。	異因即起因，故離彼誑心即成實語，實語即是誑心對治故。	Different causes are the causes for arising, so apart from that deceptive mind, one becomes truly truthful. True speech is the antidote to the deceptive mind, therefore.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a02_13']	對治離即是因離，不同身三故。	對治離即是因離，不同身三故。	The antidote and separation are the separation of causes, unlike the three of the body.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a03_12']	身三各具三離，口四唯二，意三唯一。	身三各具三離，口四唯二，意三唯一。	The three of the body each have three separations, the four of the mouth have only two, and the three of the mind have only one.

This means that even if one does not see something, if the mind thinks it is seen and one says one has seen it, it is still called true speech.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a06_15']	真語者，審善思量如事真故，謂由心思與事相似，稱此而言。	真語者，審善思量如事真故，謂由心思與事相似，稱此而言。	True words means carefully considering things as they truly are. This means that the mind's thoughts correspond to things, and one speaks in accordance with this.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a07_16']	若唯稱事而不稱心，亦名妄語，故加善思量。	若唯稱事而不稱心，亦名妄語，故加善思量。	If one only speaks in accordance with things without corresponding to the mind, it is still called false speech, so one adds careful consideration.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a11_3']	今菩薩朝見言朝、暮見言暮，故曰知時。	今菩薩朝見言朝、暮見言暮，故曰知時。	Now, the bodhisattva speaks of the morning when he sees in the morning and speaks of the evening when he sees in the evening, thus it is called knowing the right time.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a11_13']	晉經名隨，亦順時義。	晉經名隨，亦順時義。	The Jin edition calls it following, which also means conforming to the right time.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a21_2']	初對治離、後「未破」下果行離。	初對治離、後「未破」下果行離。	The first is the practice of counteraction, and the second is the practice of the result, which is explained below.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a21_18']	對治離者，即不破壞行，此唯約心。	對治離者，即不破壞行，此唯約心。	The practice of counteraction is the practice of not destroying, which is only about the mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a22_14']	果行離者，通心及事，即是差別。	果行離者，通心及事，即是差別。	The practice of the result is both the mind and the matter, which is the distinction.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a25_10']	心者，謂傳說者必於心中憶持惡言，欲將破壞，方成離間，故文云無離間心，論經云無破壞心及為破彼故等。	心者，謂傳說者必於心中憶持惡言，欲將破壞，方成離間，故文云無離間心，論經云無破壞心及為破彼故等。	The mind refers to the one who transmits. It must be that in the mind one remembers evil words, wanting to use them to destroy, only then does it constitute division. Therefore, the text says without a mind of division. The sutra says without a mind of destruction and for the sake of destroying them, etc.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a26_2']	而論云二種，明心受。	而論云二種，明心受。	But the treatise says two kinds, clarifying the mind's reception.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a28_1']	又狎密成疎曰離間，親舊成冤曰惱害。	又狎密成疎曰離間，親舊成冤曰惱害。	Moreover, becoming estranged after intimacy is called divisiveness, and becoming enemies after being close friends is called harming.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773a29_1']	二果行離，差別有三，謂身、心、業各有二義。	二果行離，差別有三，謂身、心、業各有二義。	The second, the separation of karmic actions, has three distinctions, namely, body, mind, and karma, each with two meanings.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b01_2']	身壞二義者，謂已破未破是離間體，故名為身。	身壞二義者，謂已破未破是離間體，故名為身。	The two meanings of body perishing are the essence of divisiveness, namely, already broken and not yet broken, thus called body.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b01_14']	二「不喜」下明心壞二義：	二「不喜」下明心壞二義：	The two meanings of mind perishing are:
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b02_3']	一隨喜他、二自心樂。	一隨喜他、二自心樂。	1. rejoicing in others, 2. one's own mind being happy.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b03_12']	細則實有惡言，麁則不實虛搆。	細則實有惡言，麁則不實虛搆。	Subtle means actually having evil words, coarse means not real and falsely concocted.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b04_6']	正傳離間之言，故名為業。	正傳離間之言，故名為業。	Correctly transmitting the words of divisiveness, thus called karma.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b04_17']	今菩薩並離，故皆云不。	今菩薩並離，故皆云不。	Now the bodhisattva is completely separated from them, thus all saying not.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b05_9']	第六言不麁鄙，名離惡口。	第六言不麁鄙，名離惡口。	The sixth, not speaking coarsely or vulgarly, is called separation from evil speech.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b09_10']	今此歷別相對，先舉果行一時彰離、後說能治，次第翻前，文義便故先明果行。	今此歷別相對，先舉果行一時彰離、後說能治，次第翻前，文義便故先明果行。	Now, in this sequential and mutual comparison, the fruition is brought up first, and separation is manifested simultaneously later. The antidotes are then explained. The sequence is the opposite of the previous, because the text and meaning are convenient. The fruition is explained first.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b10_6']	今果行中，先列所離、後明能離。	今果行中，先列所離、後明能離。	Now, in the fruition, separation is listed first, and then the ability to separate is explained.

Among them, the first two clarify the time of speaking, referring to the previous four having face-to-face and not face-to-face.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b18_6']	後二明前語體不出二類：	後二明前語體不出二類：	The latter two clarify that the previous speech does not go beyond two categories:
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b18_15']	一鄙惡，謂不遜故；	一鄙惡，謂不遜故；	one is vulgar and evil, because it is not respectful;
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b19_5']	二庸賤，常無教訓故。	二庸賤，常無教訓故。	the other is common and lowly, because it always lacks teaching and admonition.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b24_18']	初瞋忿語是自瞋語體，下能令他瞋。	初瞋忿語是自瞋語體，下能令他瞋。	The first angry and resentful speech is the essence of one's own angry speech, and below it can cause others to be angry.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b25_8']	他瞋有二無饒益事：	他瞋有二無饒益事：	Others being angry has two kinds of disadvantageous matters:
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b27_1']	一初五語翻喜生瞋，謂聞而不愛，如火燒心，憶時不樂，故生怨結。	一初五語翻喜生瞋，謂聞而不愛，如火燒心，憶時不樂，故生怨結。	The first five phrases reverse joy and give rise to anger, meaning hearing what is not loved, like fire burning the heart, and not enjoying it when thinking of it, thus giving rise to resentment.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773b27_11']	熱惱者，令心胸閉塞。	熱惱者，令心胸閉塞。	Heat and distress means causing the heart and chest to be blocked and obstructed.

['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773c08_10']	上以忿心發言，故如火燒等。	上以忿心發言，故如火燒等。	Above, because angry words are spoken, they are like burning in fire, etc.
['ZH_T35_1735_035:0773c09_7']	今以言順涅槃故，令善入人心。	今以言順涅槃故，令善入人心。	Now, because the words accord with nirvana, they cause good entry into the human mind.
