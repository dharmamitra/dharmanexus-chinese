Within the five kinds of samādhi paths, they are broadly divided into two: the four kinds of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas are all called supramundane samādhis, while the paths of true word teachings and methods spoken by various devas and others belong to worldly samādhis.

Those seeking the Great Vehicle are also deeply afraid of the teachings of the śrāvakas. All of this is only expedient teaching for those who do not yet know the secret treasury.

But within this, if one clearly knows that there are only aggregates and no self, this is the śrāvaka samādhi. If one contemplates the aggregates as having no nature and no arising using the ten aspects of dependent origination, this is the bodhisattva samādhi.
