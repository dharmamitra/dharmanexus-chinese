The sūtra says, Karma is of four kinds: there is karma with black black ripening, there is karma with white white ripening, there is karma with black and white black and white ripening, and there is karma that is neither black nor white with neither black nor white ripening, able to exhaust all karma.

['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c02_1']	然契經中有處亦說：	然契經中有處亦說：	016	However, there is a scripture that says,

['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c05_8']	以無一業及一異熟是黑亦白，互相違故。	以無一業及一異熟是黑亦白，互相違故。	016	Because there is no single action or single retribution that is black and also white, because these are mutually contradictory.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c06_8']	豈不惡業果善業果雜故，是則亦應名為白黑。	豈不惡業果善業果雜故，是則亦應名為白黑。	016	Isn’t it the case that the results of evil action are mixed with the results of good action? In that case, the results of good action should also be called black and white.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c08_8']	不善業果非必應為善業果雜，欲善業果必定應為惡業果雜，以欲界中惡勝善故。	不善業果非必應為善業果雜，欲善業果必定應為惡業果雜，以欲界中惡勝善故。	016	The results of bad action are not necessarily mixed with the results of good action, but the results of good action in the realm of desire are definitely mixed with the results of bad action, because evil is superior to good in the realm of desire.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c10_7']	諸無漏業能永斷盡前三業者名為非黑，不染污故，亦名非白，以不能招白異熟故。	諸無漏業能永斷盡前三業者名為非黑，不染污故，亦名非白，以不能招白異熟故。	016	The first three kinds of karma are called nonblack because they are not defiled, and they are called nonwhite because they do not summon white retribution.

The one pure thought accompanying the ninth uninterrupted path in detachment from the desire realm causes both the black and white and the pure black to be completely eliminated, because at this time it generally eliminates the wholesome dharmas of the desire realm, and also eliminates the ninth unwholesome karma.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c26_2']	離四靜慮一一地染，第九無間道俱行無漏思，此四唯令純白業盡。	離四靜慮一一地染，第九無間道俱行無漏思，此四唯令純白業盡。	016	The four pure thoughts accompanying the ninth uninterrupted path in detachment from each of the four meditations only cause the pure white karma to be completely eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c27_1']	何緣諸地有漏善法唯最後道能斷非餘？	何緣諸地有漏善法唯最後道能斷非餘？	016	Why can the wholesome dharmas of the various stages only be eliminated by the final path and not by others?
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c28_1']	以諸善法非自性斷，已斷有容現在前故。	以諸善法非自性斷，已斷有容現在前故。	016	Because wholesome dharmas are not eliminated by their own nature, because those that have been eliminated may still appear in the present.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0083c29_10']	然由緣彼煩惱盡時方說名為斷彼善法，爾時善法得離繫故。	然由緣彼煩惱盡時方說名為斷彼善法，爾時善法得離繫故。	016	However, when the afflictions that take them as objects are eliminated, it is said that those wholesome dharmas are eliminated, because at that time the wholesome dharmas attain freedom from bondage.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0084a02_1']	由此乃至緣彼煩惱餘一品在，斷義不成，善法爾時未離繫故。	由此乃至緣彼煩惱餘一品在，斷義不成，善法爾時未離繫故。	016	Therefore, as long as even one category of the passions that have it as their object remains, the meaning of severing the bonds is not established, because at that time the good law has not yet been freed from the bonds.

['ZH_T29_1558_016:0084a07_11']	謂地獄異熟唯不善業感，故順彼受名純黑業。	謂地獄異熟唯不善業感，故順彼受名純黑業。	016	This is because the retribution of hell is produced only by unwholesome karma, and therefore karma to be experienced in hell is called pure black karma.
['ZH_T29_1558_016:0084a09_2']	唯除地獄，餘欲界中異熟皆通善惡業感，故順彼受名黑白業。	唯除地獄，餘欲界中異熟皆通善惡業感，故順彼受名黑白業。	016	With the exception of hell, the retribution of the rest of the desire realm is produced by both wholesome and unwholesome karma, and therefore karma to be experienced in the rest of the desire realm is called black and white karma.

Karma to be experienced after leaving the realm of desire is both wholesome and unwholesome and is therefore called black and white karma.
