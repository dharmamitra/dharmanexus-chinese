He knew that outside of arising and ceasing he was seeking non-arising and non-ceasing. Although his mind secretly requested it, his mouth did not form words. Therefore, he cited the external teachings, hoping the Buddha would reveal them. He recently refuted the external path's view of annihilation, causing them to know that after death there is continuation and rebirth. Profoundly, he led Ānanda to realize the true nature is not apart from the arising and ceasing of the deluded consciousness. Therefore, it is said, They attest to knowing this mind's ground of non-arising and non-ceasing.

You yourself are confused and deluded, lose the origin, and undergo reincarnation. In the midst of birth and death, you are always adrift. For this reason, the Tathāgata is called one to be pitied.

Based on this, it is known that the originally wondrous and bright mind has never been born or extinguished. The originally existent true nature is deluded and unknown. Instead, one grasps at conditioned objects and brings about wandering.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0848a20_14']	如前文云「由汝無始至于今生，認賊為子，失汝元常，故受輪轉。	如前文云「由汝無始至于今生，認賊為子，失汝元常，故受輪轉。	02a	As the previous text says, Because you have taken the thief for your son from beginningless time until now, you have lost your original and constant nature, and thus undergo birth and death in the cycle of rebirth.

Because of this, he was able to recognize the original true nature that is unborn and unceasing. Is it only this that reveals the constant nature, or is there another meaning by which true and false can be distinguished?

['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0848b04_10']	」得初果證，方斷分別，故云未得無漏。	」得初果證，方斷分別，故云未得無漏。	02a	 One who has attained the first fruit of the path has already eliminated discrimination, so it is said that he has not yet attained impurity-free purity.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0848b05_6']	自無定力，假他而見，故云承佛神力。	自無定力，假他而見，故云承佛神力。	02a	Lacking the power of concentration himself, he relies on others to see, so it is said that he sees through the Buddha's spiritual power.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0848b06_10']	借通令見者，意欲阿難信知自己見之真用有若是也。	借通令見者，意欲阿難信知自己見之真用有若是也。	02a	The intention of borrowing the power of concentration to see is to make Ānanda believe and know that his own true function of seeing is like this.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0848b07_8']	色界之首梵眾、梵輔、大梵俱名初禪。	色界之首梵眾、梵輔、大梵俱名初禪。	02a	The Brahma-world, which is the beginning of the form realm, refers to the Brahma-kāyika, the Brahma-purohita, and the Mahā-brahmā, all of which are called the first dhyāna.

['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0848b17_13']	今言閻浮者，以大千皆有閻浮，以別顯總亦不相違。	今言閻浮者，以大千皆有閻浮，以別顯總亦不相違。	02a	The reason it is said here Jambudvīpa is because the great chiliocosm all has Jambudvīpa. The specific is used to illustrate the general, and there is no contradiction.

['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a02_12']	「一切眾生從無始來迷己為物，失於本心，為物所轉，故於是中觀大觀小。	「一切眾生從無始來迷己為物，失於本心，為物所轉，故於是中觀大觀小。	02a	All sentient beings, from beginningless time, have been deluded about themselves as objects, losing their original mind, and being turned by objects, thus observing the great and the small within this.

['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a06_19']	前文云能生諸緣，緣所遣者，境從心變、心隨境轉，故見大小之異、內外之殊不能離緣觀性，但知隨境生執，故有前來種種疑倒。	前文云能生諸緣，緣所遣者，境從心變、心隨境轉，故見大小之異、內外之殊不能離緣觀性，但知隨境生執，故有前來種種疑倒。	02a	The previous text says that which can give rise to conditions is sent away by conditions. Objects transform from the mind, and the mind follows the objects. Therefore, one sees the differences in size and the distinctions between inside and outside. One is unable to observe the nature apart from conditions, but only knows to give rise to grasping according to objects, thus there are the various doubts and inversions from before.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a07_6']	二、悟物同真。	二、悟物同真。	02a	Second, understanding that objects are the same as the true.

['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a13_12']	」若了色心因緣和合虛妄有生，因緣別離虛妄名滅，生滅去來本如來藏，性真常中求於去來、迷悟、生死了無所得，斯則了妄唯真，無物可轉，為真轉物，背塵合覺，同諸佛矣。	」若了色心因緣和合虛妄有生，因緣別離虛妄名滅，生滅去來本如來藏，性真常中求於去來、迷悟、生死了無所得，斯則了妄唯真，無物可轉，為真轉物，背塵合覺，同諸佛矣。	02a	If one understands that form and mind arise falsely due to the combination of causes and conditions, and are falsely called cessation due to the separation of causes and conditions, and that arising, ceasing, coming, and going are originally the Tathāgatagarbha, and seek coming and going, delusion and enlightenment, birth and death within the true nature that is eternally abiding, nothing can be attained, this is then understanding that delusion is only true, and there is no object that can be transformed. For the true transformation of objects, turning one's back on the dust and merging with enlightenment, one is the same as all Buddhas.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a15_8']	身心圓明者，身圓明則毛端現土，心圓明則遍照法界，此乃悟物咸真，即成妙用。	身心圓明者，身圓明則毛端現土，心圓明則遍照法界，此乃悟物咸真，即成妙用。	02a	As for body and mind perfectly clear, if the body is perfectly clear, then lands appear at the tip of a hair. If the mind is perfectly clear, then it universally illuminates the Dharma realm. This is then understanding that all objects are truly real, and thus accomplishing wondrous function.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a18_1']	故下文云「我以不生不滅合如來藏，而如來藏唯妙覺明，圓照法界，是故於中一為無量，乃至坐微塵裏轉大法輪」等。	故下文云「我以不生不滅合如來藏，而如來藏唯妙覺明，圓照法界，是故於中一為無量，乃至坐微塵裏轉大法輪」等。	02a	Therefore, the text below says, I, with the unborn and unceasing, merge with the Tathāgatagarbha, and the Tathāgatagarbha, with the wondrous enlightened mind, universally illuminates the Dharma realm. Therefore, within it, one becomes boundless, and even sits in a speck of dust and turns the great wheel of the Dharma.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a21_3']	然上諸文俱約對境辨見顯不生滅，如對手之開合，身之遷變，境之可還，物之差別，麁相而辨，密示生滅即不生滅，尚見外境是生滅法。	然上諸文俱約對境辨見顯不生滅，如對手之開合，身之遷變，境之可還，物之差別，麁相而辨，密示生滅即不生滅，尚見外境是生滅法。	02a	However, the above texts all discuss the view in relation to objects to show its non-arising and ceasing. It is like discussing the coarse aspects of the opening and closing of the hands, the changes in the body, the objects that can be returned, and the distinctions between things. It secretly shows that arising and ceasing are precisely non-arising and ceasing, but it still sees external objects as arising and ceasing dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a23_17']	今此會通，令了心之與境皆是迷己所成，無心外法可以相對，則法法皆如、塵塵咸遍，分明顯示，令悟本真同如來耳。	今此會通，令了心之與境皆是迷己所成，無心外法可以相對，則法法皆如、塵塵咸遍，分明顯示，令悟本真同如來耳。	02a	Now this reconciliation makes one understand that both the mind and objects are created by the delusion of the self. There are no external dharmas that can be opposed. Then, each dharma is thusness, and every dust mote is all-pervading. It clearly shows this, making one realize the original true thusness that is the same as the Tathāgata.

['ZH_T39_1799_02a:0850a28_9']	物若是見，此則見性離身而有，故成此疑。	物若是見，此則見性離身而有，故成此疑。	02a	If objects are vision, then this vision exists apart from the body, thus giving rise to this doubt.
