First, clarifying the origins of the treatise. Second, explaining the title of the treatise. Third, explaining the text separately. The Abhidharma-kośa is a work by Vasubandhu. Vasubandhu means friend of the world. Bandhu means kinsman. In India, there was a celestial being known as Vasubandhu. The people of the world were close to him and made offerings to him. Therefore, he was named after that. The Bodhisattva's parents were named after the place where he received alms. The old translation calls him deva. This translation is mistaken. If it is said deva, it should be called deva. The Bodhisattva studied both Buddhism and non-Buddhism. He was well-versed in ancient and modern times. His fame spread throughout the five heavens. His reputation flowed through the four directions. Therefore, he was able to hide his name for several years and investigate the source of the teachings of the extensive explanations. He composed a treatise in one time and spread his famous name for myriad ages. He secretly expressed the doubts of the Sarvāstivāda school in the transmission.

['ZH_T41_1821_01a:0017a25_3']	此空界色以明為體。	此空界色以明為體。	This form of the realm of space takes brightness as its substance.
['ZH_T41_1821_01a:0017a25_12']	妙高山體四寶所成。	妙高山體四寶所成。	The substance of Mount Sumeru is composed of four kinds of jewels.

['ZH_T41_1821_01a:0017a29_11']	非由障生故非是影。	非由障生故非是影。	Since it does not arise from obstruction, it is not shadow.
['ZH_T41_1821_01a:0017b01_3']	於中見色故非是闇。	於中見色故非是闇。	Since one can see forms in between, it is not darkness.
['ZH_T41_1821_01a:0017b01_12']	由斯理證定知是明。	由斯理證定知是明。	By this reasoning, we definitely know it is brightness.
['ZH_T41_1821_01a:0017b02_10']	故此明色即是青．黃．赤．白差別。	故此明色即是青．黃．赤．白差別。	Therefore, this clarifies that form is the distinctions of blue, yellow, red, and white.
