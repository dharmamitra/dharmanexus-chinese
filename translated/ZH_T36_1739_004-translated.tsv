['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a13_0', 'ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a14_1']	第四明示因圓果滿別者，顯佛果有三種不🔽同：	第四明示因圓果滿別者，顯佛果有三種不 同：	Fourth, clarifying the distinct causes and complete fruition. It shows that the Buddha's fruition has three kinds of differences:
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a16_9']	一亡言絕行獨明法身無作果、二從行積修行滿功成多劫始成果、三創發心時十住初位體用隨緣所成果。	一亡言絕行獨明法身無作果、二從行積修行滿功成多劫始成果、三創發心時十住初位體用隨緣所成果。	First, transcending words and practices, it alone illuminates the fruition of non-action of the Dharma body; second, from accumulating practices, completing practices, and accomplishing over many eons, it finally produces fruition; third, from the initial arousal of the mind, in the first stage of the ten abodes, the essence and function follow conditions to produce fruition.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a18_15']	一亡言絕行獨明法身無作果者，即《涅槃》、《無行》等經是，隱身不現，萬事休息。	一亡言絕行獨明法身無作果者，即《涅槃》、《無行》等經是，隱身不現，萬事休息。	First, transcending words and practices, it alone illuminates the fruition of non-action of the Dharma body. This refers to the Nirvana Sutra, the Sutra of No Practice, and other sutras. The body is hidden and does not appear, and myriad affairs come to rest.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a20_4']	又云羅剎為雪山童子說「諸行無常是生滅法，生滅滅已寂滅為樂。	又云羅剎為雪山童子說「諸行無常是生滅法，生滅滅已寂滅為樂。	It is also said that the rakshasa told the Snow Mountain youth, All conditioned things are impermanent, they are dharmas of arising and ceasing. When arising and ceasing cease, then there is peace and bliss.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a20_15']	」是無作果，不具行故。	」是無作果，不具行故。	This is the fruition of non-action, because it does not possess practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a22_18']	二從行積修行滿多劫方明果者，即權教之中說行修成，三僧祇劫行滿所成佛果是也。	二從行積修行滿多劫方明果者，即權教之中說行修成，三僧祇劫行滿所成佛果是也。	Second, from the accumulation of practice, the fruition is manifested after many eons. This refers to the teaching of provisional meaning that speaks of the fruition of practice, the fruition of Buddhahood accomplished after three incalculable eons of practice.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a24_13']	以不了無明十二有支本是法身智慧，厭而以空觀折伏現行煩惱欣別淨門。	以不了無明十二有支本是法身智慧，厭而以空觀折伏現行煩惱欣別淨門。	Because they do not understand that the twelve links of dependent arising and ignorance are originally the wisdom and Dharma body, they become weary and use the contemplation of emptiness to subdue the active afflictions and yearn for a separate pure gate.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a26_2']	三從凡十住初心創證隨緣運用所成果者，即《華嚴經》是也。	三從凡十住初心創證隨緣運用所成果者，即《華嚴經》是也。	Third, from the initial stage of the ten abodes, the fruition is manifested based on the initial realization and the application of conditions. This refers to the Flower Ornament Sutra.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740a28_1']	十信終心即以方便三昧達無明十二有支成理智大悲，即具文殊普賢體用法界法門。	十信終心即以方便三昧達無明十二有支成理智大悲，即具文殊普賢體用法界法門。	At the end of the stage of ten faiths, one uses the samādhi of skillful means to penetrate the twelve links of dependent arising and ignorance to form the wisdom of principle and phenomena and great compassion, and thus possesses the Dharma gates of the Dharma realm of the essence and function of Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b03_8']	又如化佛所施因果教行，定經三僧祇，所有佛功德總是修生，百劫修相好業，然燈得光明，不殺得長壽、布施得資財、忍辱得端正，一一因果屬對相似具足，仍對治種種法門，始得見性成佛。	又如化佛所施因果教行，定經三僧祇，所有佛功德總是修生，百劫修相好業，然燈得光明，不殺得長壽、布施得資財、忍辱得端正，一一因果屬對相似具足，仍對治種種法門，始得見性成佛。	Moreover, it is like the causes and effects, teachings, and practices bestowed by the transformed Buddha, which definitely take three asaṃkhyeya kalpas. All the Buddha's merits are cultivated and produced. Cultivating the karma of the major and minor marks for a hundred kalpas, one obtains radiance from the lamp. Not killing obtains long life, giving obtains wealth, and patience obtains uprightness. Each cause and effect corresponds to each other in similarity and completeness, and still uses various dharma gates to counteract, only then seeing one's nature and becoming a Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b05_12']	如《華嚴經》即不然，一念頓證法界法門，身心性相本唯法體，施為運用動寂任真運無作智即是佛也。	如《華嚴經》即不然，一念頓證法界法門，身心性相本唯法體，施為運用動寂任真運無作智即是佛也。	It is not so in the Huayan Sutra. In a single thought, one suddenly realizes the dharma gates of the Dharma realm. The nature, characteristics, and essence of body and mind are originally only the essence of dharmas. In giving, using, moving, and being still, one entrusts oneself to the true and operates the unconditioned wisdom, which is precisely Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b06_16']	為一切佛應如是，無長無短始終畢竟，法皆如是。	為一切佛應如是，無長無短始終畢竟，法皆如是。	All Buddhas should be like this, without length or shortness, beginning or end, ultimately. All dharmas are like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b08_1']	於一真法界任法施為，悉皆具足恒沙德用，即因即果。	於一真法界任法施為，悉皆具足恒沙德用，即因即果。	In the one true Dharma realm, entrusting oneself to the giving of dharmas, one is fully endowed with the functions of the merits of the sands of the Ganges, which are causes and effects.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b09_19']	以此普門法界理智諸障自無，無別對治、別修別斷，不見變化，變與不變無異性相故。	以此普門法界理智諸障自無，無別對治、別修別斷，不見變化，變與不變無異性相故。	By this universal Dharma realm of principle and wisdom, all obstacles are naturally absent, without separate antidotes, separate cultivation, or separate elimination. One does not see transformation, because transformed and untransformed have no different natures or characteristics.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b12_11']	普觀一切無非法門、無非解脫，但為自心強生繫著，為多事故沈潛苦流，故勞聖說種種差別，於所說處復生繫著。	普觀一切無非法門、無非解脫，但為自心強生繫著，為多事故沈潛苦流，故勞聖說種種差別，於所說處復生繫著。	Universally observing all, there is nothing that is not a Dharma gate, nothing that is not liberation. But because one's own mind strongly gives rise to attachment and is involved in many things, one sinks and submerges in the current of suffering. Therefore, the sages laboriously expound various distinctions, and one again gives rise to attachment to what is expounded.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b13_11']	以此義故，聖說不同，或漸或圓，應諸根器。	以此義故，聖說不同，或漸或圓，應諸根器。	For this reason, the sages' teachings differ, either gradual or perfect, in accordance with various capacities.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b14_8']	如此經教頓示圓乘，上上乘人所應堪受；	如此經教頓示圓乘，上上乘人所應堪受；	Such sūtras as this one suddenly reveal the perfect vehicle, which is suitable for those of the highest capacity.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b15_8']	設不堪受者，當須樂修，究竟歸流畢居此海。	設不堪受者，當須樂修，究竟歸流畢居此海。	Even if one is not yet able to accept it, one should still delight in cultivating it, and ultimately return to this ocean.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b17_2']	是故餘教先因後果，不同此教因果同時，為法性智海中因果不可得故。	是故餘教先因後果，不同此教因果同時，為法性智海中因果不可得故。	Therefore, other teachings prioritize cause over effect, unlike this teaching in which cause and effect are simultaneous, because in the ocean of Dharma-nature wisdom, cause and effect cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b17_18']	為不可得中，因果同時無有障礙也。	為不可得中，因果同時無有障礙也。	Because within the unobtainable, cause and effect are simultaneous without obstruction.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b19_3']	可得因果即有前後，有所得者皆是無常，非究竟說也。	可得因果即有前後，有所得者皆是無常，非究竟說也。	The cause and effect can be obtained, but there is a sequence of before and after. What is obtained is all impermanent, not the ultimate teaching.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b20_1']	若先因後果者，因亦不成，故果亦壞也。	若先因後果者，因亦不成，故果亦壞也。	If the cause comes before and the effect comes after, the cause is also not established, so the effect is also destroyed.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b23_19']	緣生之法不相續故、即斷滅故、自他不成故，如數一錢不數後錢，無後二者一亦不成，為剎那不相續，剎那因不成，果亦壞，多劫不相續，多劫因果壞，要待數後錢時前一始成。	緣生之法不相續故、即斷滅故、自他不成故，如數一錢不數後錢，無後二者一亦不成，為剎那不相續，剎那因不成，果亦壞，多劫不相續，多劫因果壞，要待數後錢時前一始成。	Because the dharmas of dependent origination do not continue, because they are cut off and extinguished, and because self and other are not established, it is like counting one coin and not counting the subsequent coins. Without the subsequent two, the one is also not established. Because the moments do not continue, the cause of the moment is not established, and the effect is also destroyed. Because the causes and effects of many eons do not continue, the causes and effects of many eons are destroyed. It is necessary to wait until the subsequent coins are counted before the previous one is established.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b24_17']	因果亦爾，要待一時中無間者因果始成。	因果亦爾，要待一時中無間者因果始成。	Causes and effects are also like this. It is necessary to wait until there is no interval in a single moment before the causes and effects are established.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b25_19']	若爾者，如數兩錢同數，無前無後，誰為一二？	若爾者，如數兩錢同數，無前無後，誰為一二？	If so, it is like counting two coins together, without before and after. Who are the one and the two?
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b26_8']	如竪二指，誰為因果？	如竪二指，誰為因果？	It is like raising two fingers. Who are the cause and effect?
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b27_4']	如二指等，隨心數處為因、後數為果。	如二指等，隨心數處為因、後數為果。	It is like the two fingers and so forth. According to the place where the mind counts, the subsequent counting is the effect.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b28_13']	若是有前有後，即有中間者，還有剎那間斷，有間斷者不成因果。	若是有前有後，即有中間者，還有剎那間斷，有間斷者不成因果。	If there is a before and an after, then there is a middle. But if there is a moment of interruption, then there is no cause and effect.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b29_12']	若同時者，如竪二指無前無後，誰為因果？	若同時者，如竪二指無前無後，誰為因果？	If they are simultaneous, like raising two fingers with no before and no after, who is the cause and who is the effect?
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740b29_17']	亦皆不成。	亦皆不成。	They are all not established.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c04_14']	如此《華嚴經》因果同時者，俱無如是前後及同時情量繫著妄想，有無、俱不俱、常無常等繫著因果，但了法體非所施設、非因果繫名為因果，非情所立同時前後之妄想也。	如此《華嚴經》因果同時者，俱無如是前後及同時情量繫著妄想，有無、俱不俱、常無常等繫著因果，但了法體非所施設、非因果繫名為因果，非情所立同時前後之妄想也。	In this way, the cause and effect of the Flower Ornament Sutra are simultaneous, both without such attachments to before and after, or simultaneous conceptual thoughts, and are not attached to cause and effect such as existence and non-existence, both and neither, permanence and impermanence, etc. They only understand that the essence of dharmas is not something that can be established, and is not bound by cause and effect. It is called cause and effect, not the conceptual thought of simultaneity or sequence established by the mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c05_9']	如是者何異《楞伽》漸教之說？	如是者何異《楞伽》漸教之說？	How is this different from the gradual teachings of the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra?
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c05_14']	此則不然。	此則不然。	This is not so.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c07_4']	前說教主別、問答主別等，即明文殊、普賢、佛等三德體用主伴無礙故。	前說教主別、問答主別等，即明文殊、普賢、佛等三德體用主伴無礙故。	The previous explanation of the difference in the teaching masters, the difference in the questioners and answerers, etc., clearly shows that Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, the Buddha, etc., the essence and function of the three virtues are unobstructed as the host and companions.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c08_18']	《楞伽經》中，化佛及大慧菩薩問答破相，但知顯理無繫著故，不論緣起法界。	《楞伽經》中，化佛及大慧菩薩問答破相，但知顯理無繫著故，不論緣起法界。	In the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, the nirmāṇakāya Buddha and Mahāmati Bodhisattva ask and answer to destroy characteristics, only knowing to manifest the principle without attachment, therefore not discussing the dharmadhātu of dependent origination.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c10_1']	如緣起法界者，法界不成不破，但知了法如是故。	如緣起法界者，法界不成不破，但知了法如是故。	As for the dharmadhātu of dependent origination, the dharmadhātu is neither established nor destroyed, only knowing that phenomena are thus.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c10_22']	是故《楞伽經》云「先示相似物，後當與真實。	是故《楞伽經》云「先示相似物，後當與真實。	Therefore, the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra says, First show something similar, later give the true.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c11_15']	」又云「得相者是識，不得相者是智。	」又云「得相者是識，不得相者是智。	It also says, The one who obtains characteristics is consciousness, the one who does not obtain characteristics is wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c12_2']	」即是明成壞也。	」即是明成壞也。	This clarifies establishment and destruction.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c13_15']	如此經中意者，即真無有假法，諸法總真，純真無假，更無相似存真存假。	如此經中意者，即真無有假法，諸法總真，純真無假，更無相似存真存假。	The meaning in this sūtra is that the true has no provisional phenomena, all phenomena are the true, pure truth without falsity, no more similar existence of the true and the provisional.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c14_6']	經云「眾生界即佛界」也。	經云「眾生界即佛界」也。	The sūtra says, The realm of sentient beings is the Buddha realm.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c16_3']	如此經中，文殊以理會行，普賢以行會理，二人體用相徹，以成一真法界，前後相收。	如此經中，文殊以理會行，普賢以行會理，二人體用相徹，以成一真法界，前後相收。	In this sūtra, Mañjuśrī uses principle to accord with practice, and Samantabhadra uses practice to accord with principle. The two people's essence and function penetrate each other, forming the one true dharmadhātu, with the beginning and end mutually including each other.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c17_11']	四十品經互相該括，前後相徹、文義相收，一法門中具多法也。	四十品經互相該括，前後相徹、文義相收，一法門中具多法也。	The forty chapters of the sutra mutually encompass each other, with the beginning and end penetrating each other and the text and meaning mutually including each other, with many dharmas contained within a single dharma gate.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c18_12']	是故經云「於多法中為一法，於一法中為眾多。	是故經云「於多法中為一法，於一法中為眾多。	Therefore, the sutra says, In many dharmas, there is one dharma. In one dharma, there are many.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c19_11']	」於漸教中，設有少分義同，多分不相似故。	」於漸教中，設有少分義同，多分不相似故。	In the gradual teachings, even if there are a few points that are similar in meaning, for the most part, they are not similar.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c22_19']	如覺首等十首菩薩各說一法以成十信，於十信中共成一信，為十箇信位互體相成不獨施設，以十信成一信、以一信成十信，有解者不可偏取一門。	如覺首等十首菩薩各說一法以成十信，於十信中共成一信，為十箇信位互體相成不獨施設，以十信成一信、以一信成十信，有解者不可偏取一門。	For example, the ten bodhisattvas led by Jñānaprabha each expound a single dharma to establish the ten faiths. Within the ten faiths, they jointly form one faith, with the ten stages of faith mutually supporting each other and not merely established alone. Using the ten faiths to form one faith and using one faith to form the ten faiths, those who understand should not take a single gate as biased.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c26_7']	十慧菩薩、十林菩薩、十幢菩薩、十藏菩薩，又說十定、十通、十忍，如是一一位次法門皆悉如是互相成就，如帝釋網互相徹入，一中無量、無量中一。	十慧菩薩、十林菩薩、十幢菩薩、十藏菩薩，又說十定、十通、十忍，如是一一位次法門皆悉如是互相成就，如帝釋網互相徹入，一中無量、無量中一。	Ten Wisdom Bodhisattvas, Ten Forest Bodhisattvas, Ten Banner Bodhisattvas, and Ten Treasury Bodhisattvas, and also expounded ten samādhis, ten spiritual powers, and ten forbearances. In this way, the Dharma gates of each stage are all mutually accomplished like this, mutually penetrating each other like Indra's net, one within innumerable, innumerable within one.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c27_6']	諸佛菩薩體用相成、因果相入，同時無二。	諸佛菩薩體用相成、因果相入，同時無二。	The essence and function of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are mutually accomplished, and cause and effect mutually enter, simultaneously without duality.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c27_11']	如經中說：	如經中說：	As it is said in the sūtras:
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c28_9']	法慧菩薩入定，即十方世界同名法慧佛來。	法慧菩薩入定，即十方世界同名法慧佛來。	When Dharma Wisdom Bodhisattva enters samādhi, Buddhas from worlds in the ten directions with the same name Dharma Wisdom come.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0740c29_11', 'ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a01_14']	功德林菩薩入定，即十方世界同名功德林佛來。🔽金剛幢菩薩入定，即十方世界同名金剛幢佛來。	功德林菩薩入定，即十方世界同名功德林佛來。 金剛幢菩薩入定，即十方世界同名金剛幢佛來。	When Merit Forest Bodhisattva enters samādhi, Buddhas from worlds in the ten directions with the same name Merit Forest come.🔽When Vajra Banner Bodhisattva enters samādhi, Buddhas from worlds in the ten directions with the same name Vajra Banner come.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a02_18']	金剛藏菩薩入定，即十方世界同名金剛藏佛來摩頂。	金剛藏菩薩入定，即十方世界同名金剛藏佛來摩頂。	When Vajra Treasury Bodhisattva enters samādhi, Buddhas from worlds in the ten directions with the same name Vajra Treasury come to rub his head.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a04_6']	如是位位之內、地地之中，佛與菩薩因果相成、體用相徹。	如是位位之內、地地之中，佛與菩薩因果相成、體用相徹。	In this way, within each stage and within each level, the Buddha and the bodhisattvas mutually accomplish cause and effect, and principle and phenomena interpenetrate.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a05_10']	所來諸佛即明是果，入定菩薩即明是因，因果無二故。	所來諸佛即明是果，入定菩薩即明是因，因果無二故。	The buddhas who come are the fruition, and the bodhisattvas who enter concentration are the cause, because cause and effect are non-dual.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a07_16']	於佛法身智體上，安立十住、十行、十迴向、十地、十一地等行相，引接凡俗化生之門，諸位則佛、佛則諸位。	於佛法身智體上，安立十住、十行、十迴向、十地、十一地等行相，引接凡俗化生之門，諸位則佛、佛則諸位。	On the basis of the Buddha's Dharma body and wisdom essence, the characteristics of the practices of the ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and eleventh ground, etc. are established, and the gate of guiding and transforming ordinary people is opened. In all the stages, the buddhas are the stages, and the stages are the buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a10_14']	若上上根人於此教中起信者，還依此法，創首十住初心正證如來佛果智法，方行一切菩薩萬行，為初證之首為知法智體性故。	若上上根人於此教中起信者，還依此法，創首十住初心正證如來佛果智法，方行一切菩薩萬行，為初證之首為知法智體性故。	If those of the highest capacity give rise to faith in this teaching, they will still rely on this Dharma. At the beginning, the initial mind of the ten abodes directly realizes the wisdom and Dharma of the fruition of the Tathāgata Buddha, and then practices all the myriad practices of bodhisattvas. It is the head of the initial realization, in order to know the essence of the wisdom of the Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a13_6']	設同凡事，經過多劫行，而於自見本不移時，於初發心時與三世佛同成正覺，無前後際故、法如是故，應如是知。	設同凡事，經過多劫行，而於自見本不移時，於初發心時與三世佛同成正覺，無前後際故、法如是故，應如是知。	Even if they engage in ordinary activities for many eons, they do not move from their original perspective. At the time of first generating the mind of enlightenment, they are the same as the buddhas of the three times in attaining perfect enlightenment, without any distinction of past, present, or future. It should be understood that the Dharma is like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a14_12']	不同權教，經三僧祇方成佛果，是故今言與諸三乘得果別故。	不同權教，經三僧祇方成佛果，是故今言與諸三乘得果別故。	It is not the same as the provisional teachings, where one attains buddhahood only after three incalculable eons. Therefore, it is said now that it is different from the attainment of fruition by the three vehicles.
['ZH_T36_1739_004:0741a16_17']	又於經乘如來一切智乘得佛果故，無二乘人得四沙門果，亦無權教菩薩諸地行相因前果後也。	又於經乘如來一切智乘得佛果故，無二乘人得四沙門果，亦無權教菩薩諸地行相因前果後也。	Moreover, because the Tathāgata attains buddhahood by riding the vehicle of omniscience, there are no people of the two vehicles who attain the four fruits of śramaṇas, nor are there bodhisattvas of the provisional teachings who engage in the practices of the stages with causes preceding and effects following.
