['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b11_3']	分二別：	分二別：	040	In the second gate of being subsumed within the one mind, this gate actually contains many meanings, and is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b12_4']	一推末歸本門、二「如來於此」下本末依持門。	一推末歸本門、二「如來於此」下本末依持門。	040	First, the gate of tracing back the branches to the root; second, the gate of the root and branches supporting each other, beginning with The Tathāgata, in this...
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b13_7']	今初，依論三觀，初約相諦，即當第二第一義諦觀。	今初，依論三觀，初約相諦，即當第二第一義諦觀。	040	First, based on the three contemplations in the treatise, the first is about the characteristics and truths, which corresponds to the second contemplation of the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b14_1']	論生起云「云何第一義差別？	論生起云「云何第一義差別？	040	The treatise states: What is the distinction of the ultimate truth?
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b14_15']	如是證第一義則得解脫彼觀故。	如是證第一義則得解脫彼觀故。	040	Thus, realizing the ultimate truth, one attains liberation from that contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b15_4']	」此明修觀所以。	」此明修觀所以。	040	This clarifies the purpose of cultivating contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b16_10']	以第一義是緣生之性，若見緣性則脫緣縛，故修彼觀。	以第一義是緣生之性，若見緣性則脫緣縛，故修彼觀。	040	Because the ultimate truth is the nature of dependent origination. If one sees the nature of dependent origination, one is liberated from the bonds of conditions, so one cultivates that contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b17_16']	而論經雖云皆一心作意，取能作一心，故云第一義觀。	而論經雖云皆一心作意，取能作一心，故云第一義觀。	040	Although the treatise says that all are created by the one mind, it takes the one mind that creates as the object, so it is called the contemplation of the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b18_14']	論云但是一心者，一切三界唯心轉故。	論云但是一心者，一切三界唯心轉故。	040	The treatise says it is only the one mind because the entire three realms only revolve around the mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b18_19']	此言則總。	此言則總。	040	This statement is general.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b19_11']	轉者，起作義，亦轉變義。	轉者，起作義，亦轉變義。	040	Transformation has the meaning of arising and creating, as well as the meaning of transformation.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b20_4']	然此一文，諸教同引證成唯心。	然此一文，諸教同引證成唯心。	040	However, this single text is cited by all teachings to prove that it is mind-only.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b20_13']	云何一心而作三界？	云何一心而作三界？	040	How can one mind create the three realms?
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b20_18']	略有三義：	略有三義：	040	In brief, there are three meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b21_15']	一二乘之人，謂有前境，不了唯心。	一二乘之人，謂有前境，不了唯心。	040	First, those of the two vehicles think there are external objects and do not understand that they are only mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b23_2']	縱聞一心，但謂真諦之一，或謂由心轉變，非皆是心。	縱聞一心，但謂真諦之一，或謂由心轉變，非皆是心。	040	Even if they hear of one mind, they only think of the one of true suchness, or think that it is transformed by the mind, not all of it being mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b24_3']	二異熟賴耶名為一心，揀無外境故說一心。	二異熟賴耶名為一心，揀無外境故說一心。	040	Second, the one mind of the retribution consciousness is called one mind, because it distinguishes from external objects and therefore speaks of one mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b25_3']	三如來藏性清淨一心，理無二體故說一心。	三如來藏性清淨一心，理無二體故說一心。	040	Third, the one mind of the intrinsically pure nature of the tathāgatagarbha is called one mind, because the principle has no two natures.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b25_15']	此初一心，菩薩不為此觀。	此初一心，菩薩不為此觀。	040	The bodhisattvas do not contemplate this first one mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b27_11']	後二一心，經意正明通於三觀，約清淨一心為第一觀，通此二心為後二觀。	後二一心，經意正明通於三觀，約清淨一心為第一觀，通此二心為後二觀。	040	The latter two one minds are what the sūtra intends to clarify, which is common to the three contemplations. The first contemplation is based on the intrinsically pure one mind, and the latter two contemplations are common to these two minds.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b28_7']	後二一心略如問明，廣開有十：	後二一心略如問明，廣開有十：	040	The latter two one minds are briefly like the questions and explanations, and there are ten in detail:
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806b29_10']	初之一門假說一心，謂實有外法，但由心變動故。	初之一門假說一心，謂實有外法，但由心變動故。	040	The first of these one-sided doctrines is that of the existence of real external objects, which are only transformed by mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c01_1']	下之九門實唯一心。	下之九門實唯一心。	040	The remaining nine doctrines are all one-sided doctrines of mind only.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c02_12']	二相見俱存故說一心，此通八識及諸心所，并所變相分本影具足。	二相見俱存故說一心，此通八識及諸心所，并所變相分本影具足。	040	The second one-sided doctrine is that of the existence of both images and seeing, which is common to the eight consciousnesses and their mental activities, as well as to the seen and seeing parts of the images transformed by the consciousnesses, which are complete in the form of the original and its reflections.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c04_7']	由有支等熏習力故，變現三界依正等報，如《攝大乘》及《唯識》等諸論廣說。	由有支等熏習力故，變現三界依正等報，如《攝大乘》及《唯識》等諸論廣說。	040	As a result of the power of perfuming by the members of the dependent co-arising, the consciousnesses transform and manifest the three realms of existence, the bodies of sentient beings and their container worlds, as is explained in detail in such treatises as the Mahāyānasaṃgraha and Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c07_7']	三攝相歸見故說一心，亦通王數，但所變相分無別種生，能見識生帶彼影起，如《解深密經》、《二十唯識》、《觀所緣緣論》具說斯義。	三攝相歸見故說一心，亦通王數，但所變相分無別種生，能見識生帶彼影起，如《解深密經》、《二十唯識》、《觀所緣緣論》具說斯義。	040	The third one-sided doctrine is that of the return of the seen to the seer, which is common to the seeing part of the consciousnesses and their mental activities. The seen part of the images transformed by the consciousnesses is not born from separate seeds. The seeing consciousness is born and arises with the image of the seen part. This doctrine is explained in detail in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, the Vimsatikā, and the Ālambanaparīkṣā.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c09_6']	四攝數歸王故說一心，唯通八識，以彼心所依王無體亦心變故，如《莊嚴論》說。	四攝數歸王故說一心，唯通八識，以彼心所依王無體亦心變故，如《莊嚴論》說。	040	The fourth one-sided doctrine is that of the return of the mental activities to the mind, which is common only to the eight consciousnesses, because the mental activities have no substance apart from the consciousnesses and are also transformations of the consciousnesses, as the Madhyāntavibhāga says.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c10_14']	五以末歸本故說一心，謂七轉識皆是本識差別功能，無別體故。	五以末歸本故說一心，謂七轉識皆是本識差別功能，無別體故。	040	Fifth, it is said that there is only one mind because the branches are returned to the root, that is, the seven evolving consciousnesses are the different functions of the fundamental consciousness and have no separate substance of their own.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c12_2']	《楞伽》云「藏識海常住，境界風所動，種種諸識浪，騰躍而轉生。	《楞伽》云「藏識海常住，境界風所動，種種諸識浪，騰躍而轉生。	040	The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra says, The ocean of store consciousness always abides, moved by the winds of objects, with waves of various consciousnesses leaping and evolving.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c13_9']	」又云「譬如巨海浪，無有若干相，諸識心如是，異亦不可得。	」又云「譬如巨海浪，無有若干相，諸識心如是，異亦不可得。	040	It also says, Just as the ocean has waves that do not have many different forms, so it is with the various consciousnesses and minds; their differences also cannot be grasped.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c14_8']	」既云離水無別有浪，明離本識無別前七。	」既云離水無別有浪，明離本識無別前七。	040	Since it is said that apart from water there are no waves, it is clear that apart from the fundamental consciousness there are no other first seven consciousnesses.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c16_4']	六攝相歸性故說一心，謂此八識皆無自體，唯如來藏平等顯現，餘相皆盡。	六攝相歸性故說一心，謂此八識皆無自體，唯如來藏平等顯現，餘相皆盡。	040	Sixth, it is said that there is only one mind because the characteristics are returned to their nature, that is, these eight consciousnesses all have no self-nature, and only the Tathāgatagarbha is equally manifested, with all other characteristics exhausted.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c16_18']	經云「一切眾生即涅槃相」等。	經云「一切眾生即涅槃相」等。	040	A scripture says, All sentient beings are characterized by nirvāṇa, and so on.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c17_13']	《楞伽》云「不壞相有八，無相亦無相。	《楞伽》云「不壞相有八，無相亦無相。	040	The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra says, The eight characteristics of non-destruction exist, but the characteristic of non-existence also does not exist.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c18_3']	」如是等文誠證非一。	」如是等文誠證非一。	040	There are many such passages as evidence.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c21_1']	七性相俱融故說一心，謂如來藏舉體隨緣成辦諸事，而其自性本不生滅，即此理事渾融無礙，是故一心二諦皆無障礙。	七性相俱融故說一心，謂如來藏舉體隨緣成辦諸事，而其自性本不生滅，即此理事渾融無礙，是故一心二諦皆無障礙。	040	Seventh, because of the fusion of nature and characteristics, it is said to be one mind. This means that the tathāgatagarbha as a whole follows conditions to accomplish all things, yet its own nature is originally neither produced nor extinguished. This principle and phenomena are completely fused without obstruction. Therefore, the one mind and the two truths are all unobstructed.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c22_2']	《起信》云「依一心法有二種門，乃至不相離故。	《起信》云「依一心法有二種門，乃至不相離故。	040	The Awakening of Faith says, Based on the Dharma of one mind, there are two kinds of gates, up to and including being inseparable.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c23_8']	」又《密嚴》云「佛說如來藏，以為阿賴耶」，及如金與指環喻等。	」又《密嚴》云「佛說如來藏，以為阿賴耶」，及如金與指環喻等。	040	Also, the Secret Adornment Sutra says, The Buddha says that the tathāgatagarbha is the ālaya, and the analogy of gold and a finger ring, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c24_11']	又《勝鬘》云「自性清淨心，不染而染，難可了知。	又《勝鬘》云「自性清淨心，不染而染，難可了知。	040	Also, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says, The intrinsically pure mind, defiled while undefiled, is difficult to understand.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c25_2']	染而不染，亦難可了知。	染而不染，亦難可了知。	040	Defiled yet not defiled, it is also difficult to understand.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c26_12']	」皆明性淨隨染舉體成俗即生滅門，染性常淨本來真淨即真如門。	」皆明性淨隨染舉體成俗即生滅門，染性常淨本來真淨即真如門。	040	All clarify that the intrinsically pure mind follows defilement, and the whole body becomes conventional, which is the arising and ceasing aspect. The defiled nature is always pure, originally true and pure, which is the aspect of suchness.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0806c28_17']	斯則即淨之染不礙真而恒俗，即染之淨不破俗而恒真，是故不礙一心雙存二諦，深思有味。	斯則即淨之染不礙真而恒俗，即染之淨不破俗而恒真，是故不礙一心雙存二諦，深思有味。	040	This means that the defiled aspect of purity does not obstruct the true and always accords with the conventional, and the pure aspect of defilement does not destroy the conventional and always accords with the true. Therefore, it does not obstruct the single mind and both truths are present. Contemplate deeply, there is meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a01_13']	八融事相入故說一心，謂由心性圓融無礙以性成事，事亦鎔融不相障礙。	八融事相入故說一心，謂由心性圓融無礙以性成事，事亦鎔融不相障礙。	040	Eighth, it is said that there is one mind because phenomena interpenetrate, meaning that because the nature of mind is perfectly fused and unobstructed, and because the nature forms phenomena, phenomena are also fused and do not obstruct each other.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a03_6']	一入一切一中解無量等，一一塵內各見法界，天人脩羅不離一塵。	一入一切一中解無量等，一一塵內各見法界，天人脩羅不離一塵。	040	One enters all, in one there is understanding of the immeasurable, etc., each dust mote contains the Dharma realm, and gods, humans, and asuras do not leave a single dust mote.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a03_11']	其文非一。	其文非一。	040	The text is not one.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a05_11']	九令事相即故說一心，謂依性之事事無別事，心性既無彼此之異事，亦一切即一。	九令事相即故說一心，謂依性之事事無別事，心性既無彼此之異事，亦一切即一。	040	Ninth, it is said that there is one mind because phenomena are mutually inclusive, meaning that phenomena based on the nature are not separate phenomena, and since the nature of mind is already without difference between this and that, phenomena are also all one.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a06_5']	上文云「一即是多多即一」等。	上文云「一即是多多即一」等。	040	The above text says one is many, many is one, etc.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a08_11']	十帝網無礙故說一心，謂一中有一切，彼一切中復有一切，重重無盡，皆以心識如來藏性圓融無盡故。	十帝網無礙故說一心，謂一中有一切，彼一切中復有一切，重重無盡，皆以心識如來藏性圓融無盡故。	040	The tenth is called one mind because of the unobstructedness of the Indra's net, meaning that within one there are all, and within all there are again all, with layers upon layers being inexhaustible, all because the nature of the mind consciousness tathāgatagarbha is perfectly fused and inexhaustible.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a10_2']	上之十門，初一小教、次三涉權、次三就實、後三約圓中不共。	上之十門，初一小教、次三涉權、次三就實、後三約圓中不共。	040	The first of the above ten is a small teaching, the next three involve the provisional, the next three are based on the real, and the last three are about the unique aspects of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a10_13']	若下同諸乘，通十無礙。	若下同諸乘，通十無礙。	040	If the following is the same as the other vehicles, it is universally unobstructed.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a11_16']	一部大宗非獨此品隨一一門成觀各異，可以虛求。	一部大宗非獨此品隨一一門成觀各異，可以虛求。	040	The great purport of the entire text is not just this chapter. Each of the individual gates forms a different contemplation, which can be sought in vain.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a12_6']	第二本末依持門。	第二本末依持門。	040	Second, the gate of basis and derivative.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a13_1']	此下終於十門，皆是世諦差別。	此下終於十門，皆是世諦差別。	040	From here to the end of the ten gates, all are distinctions of conventional truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a14_1']	緣相本寂但應觀真，何以復觀世諦差別？	緣相本寂但應觀真，何以復觀世諦差別？	040	Since the characteristics of conditions are originally quiescent, one should only contemplate the truth. Why then also contemplate the distinctions of conventional truth?
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a14_18']	論云「隨順觀世諦，即入第一義」故。	論云「隨順觀世諦，即入第一義」故。	040	The treatise says: In accordance with the contemplation of conventional truth, one enters the ultimate truth. Therefore.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a15_11']	俗為真詮，了俗無性方見真耳。	俗為真詮，了俗無性方見真耳。	040	The conventional serves as the explanation for the truth. Only by understanding the naturelessness of the conventional can one see the truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a16_10']	《中論》云「若不知世諦，不得第一義」故。	《中論》云「若不知世諦，不得第一義」故。	040	The Zhonglun says: If one does not know the conventional truth, one cannot attain the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a16_15']	此觀有六：	此觀有六：	040	This contemplation has six aspects:
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a17_17']	一何者是染染依止觀，即雙辨能依所依攝此半門。	一何者是染染依止觀，即雙辨能依所依攝此半門。	040	First, the contemplation of what is defiled and the basis of defilement, which simultaneously clarifies the supported and the basis, encompassing this half of the chapter.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a18_13']	二因觀，觀染因故，攝次二門。	二因觀，觀染因故，攝次二門。	040	Second, the contemplation of causes, because it contemplates the causes of defilement, encompassing the next two chapters.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a19_3']	三攝過觀，唯苦集故。	三攝過觀，唯苦集故。	040	Third, the contemplation of encompassing faults, because it is exclusively about suffering and its causes.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a19_14']	四護過觀，護凡邪見故。	四護過觀，護凡邪見故。	040	Fourth, the contemplation of guarding against faults, because it guards against the false views of ordinary people.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a20_4']	五不厭厭觀，防小慢故。	五不厭厭觀，防小慢故。	040	Fifth, the contemplation of non-disgust and disgust, because it prevents the arrogance of the Lesser Vehicle.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a20_13']	上三次第各攝一門。	上三次第各攝一門。	040	The above three contemplations each encompass one chapter in sequence.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a21_10']	六深觀，顯因緣之理妙，過情取故。	六深觀，顯因緣之理妙，過情取故。	040	Sixth, the profound contemplation, which reveals the wondrous principle of dependent origination that surpasses conceptual grasping.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a21_16']	此攝後三門。	此攝後三門。	040	This encompasses the last three chapters.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a23_9']	六中初二建立染相、次一就染觀過、次二正觀防非、後一觀行深極。	六中初二建立染相、次一就染觀過、次二正觀防非、後一觀行深極。	040	Among the six contemplations, the first two establish the characteristics of defilement, the next one contemplates the faults within defilement, the next two contemplate correctly to prevent errors, and the last one is the profound culmination of contemplative practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a25_9']	今此半門即染依止觀，因緣有分為染，而此染相依止一心，故論云「此是二諦差別。	今此半門即染依止觀，因緣有分為染，而此染相依止一心，故論云「此是二諦差別。	040	Now, this half gate is the contemplation of the basis of defilement. The conditioned factors of dependent origination are defiled, but these defiled characteristics are based on one mind. Therefore, the treatise says: This is the distinction between the two truths.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a26_18']	以純真不生、單妄不成，一心之真雜染之俗此二和合有因緣集。	以純真不生、單妄不成，一心之真雜染之俗此二和合有因緣集。	040	Because pure reality does not arise alone, and delusion alone is not established. The true reality of one mind and the conventional reality of defilement - these two combine to have the accumulation of dependent origination.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a27_3']	」經中三：	」經中三：	040	There are three parts in the sutra:
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a28_5']	初總，謂依一心分別十二，則十二為一心所持。	初總，謂依一心分別十二，則十二為一心所持。	040	First, the general, which refers to distinguishing the twelve based on one mind, then the twelve are upheld by one mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807a29_5']	而特言如來說者，一心頓具，非佛不知故。	而特言如來說者，一心頓具，非佛不知故。	040	But it specifically says the Tathāgata speaks because the sudden completeness of one mind is not known by anyone but the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807b01_9']	謂顯如來過去覺緣性已等相續起，展轉傳說故。	謂顯如來過去覺緣性已等相續起，展轉傳說故。	040	It means that the Tathāgata has already realized the nature of conditions in the past, and the characteristics are equal and continuous. It is transmitted and explained in succession.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807b01_14']	次徵意云：	次徵意云：	040	Next, the meaning of the question is:
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0807b02_7']	十二有支，三世行列前後引生。	十二有支，三世行列前後引生。	040	The twelve links of dependent origination are arranged in the three times, and they arise in sequence.

['ZH_T35_1735_040:0811c05_12']	」意謂但行順無明，緣不得不生。	」意謂但行順無明，緣不得不生。	040	 The meaning is that formations only follow ignorance, and without conditions they do not arise.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0811c06_3']	互無知者，故非二作。	互無知者，故非二作。	040	Since they mutually lack knowledge, they are not the two creating.

['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812b23_2']	一者滅障，即觀諸有支皆自性滅。	一者滅障，即觀諸有支皆自性滅。	040	First, eliminating obstructions, which is observing that all the factors of existence are inherently extinguished.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812b24_4']	謂若入空門不得空，亦不取空相，則事已辦。	謂若入空門不得空，亦不取空相，則事已辦。	040	This means that if one enters the gate of emptiness and does not attain emptiness, and also does not grasp the sign of emptiness, then the matter is already accomplished.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812b25_9']	若見法先有，後說為空及取空相，非真知空，故名為障。	若見法先有，後說為空及取空相，非真知空，故名為障。	040	If one sees dharmas as existing first and later being said to be empty, and grasps the sign of emptiness, it is not true knowledge of emptiness, and is therefore called an obstruction.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812b26_5']	故修無相，了自性滅，則不取空障。	故修無相，了自性滅，則不取空障。	040	Therefore, cultivating the signless, understanding inherent extinction, then not grasping the obstruction of emptiness.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812b26_17']	二所以不取者，得對治故。	二所以不取者，得對治故。	040	Second, the reason for not taking it is because one attains the antidote.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812b27_12']	謂知空亦復空，名畢竟解脫。	謂知空亦復空，名畢竟解脫。	040	That is to say, knowing emptiness is also empty, which is called ultimate liberation.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812b29_12']	三既有能治治於所治，則念想不行，故云無有少法相生，能所斯寂，則無相現前。	三既有能治治於所治，則念想不行，故云無有少法相生，能所斯寂，則無相現前。	040	Third, since there is an antidote that counteracts the object of counteraction, then thoughts do not operate, so it is said that there are no characteristics of dharmas that arise. The counteractor and the counteracted are both quiescent, so the absence of characteristics is present.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c01_2']	三無願門亦有三種相：	三無願門亦有三種相：	040	The three aspects of the door of wishlessness are also threefold:

['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c02_16']	二體即無有願求，不求三界等故；	二體即無有願求，不求三界等故；	040	Second, the essence is the absence of wishes and requests, because one does not seek the three realms and so forth;
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c03_10']	三勝即大悲化生，勝二乘故。	三勝即大悲化生，勝二乘故。	040	Third, the excellence is the great compassion that transforms beings, because it surpasses the two vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c04_18']	又上三空通緣諸法實相，觀於世間即涅槃相故，亦不同二乘。	又上三空通緣諸法實相，觀於世間即涅槃相故，亦不同二乘。	040	Moreover, the above three kinds of emptiness universally take the true characteristics of all dharmas as their object, because they contemplate that the characteristics of the mundane world are the characteristics of nirvana, and therefore they are also not the same as the two vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c05_10']	餘如《智論》二十二說。	餘如《智論》二十二說。	040	The rest is as explained in chapter twenty-two of the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom.

['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c08_8']	初離三想是空門所離，次離有無想是無相門所離，亦無願門所離，不見有可求故。	初離三想是空門所離，次離有無想是無相門所離，亦無願門所離，不見有可求故。	040	First, being free from the three conceptual thoughts is what is to be abandoned by the gate of emptiness. Next, being free from the conceptual thoughts of existence and non-existence is what is to be abandoned by the gate of signlessness, and also what is to be abandoned by the gate of wishlessness, because one does not see anything to be sought.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c08_18']	已知離障，云何為勝？	已知離障，云何為勝？	040	Having already understood the abandonment of hindrances, how is it superior?
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c09_17']	經中三句次第勝五四地，及此地方便故。	經中三句次第勝五四地，及此地方便故。	040	The three phrases in the sūtra are superior to the fifth and fourth grounds, and to the expedient means of this ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c11_17']	謂於五地中，以十平等深淨心，遠離四地身淨我慢，此用深空滅離二我，故此勝也。	謂於五地中，以十平等深淨心，遠離四地身淨我慢，此用深空滅離二我，故此勝也。	040	That is to say, in the fifth ground, using the ten profound and pure thoughts of equality, one is far removed from the conceit of the purity of the body in the fourth ground. This uses the profound emptiness to extinguish and abandon the two kinds of self, and therefore it is superior.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c13_10']	二四地中，以道品治三地中正受出沒等慢，此用空觀以離作受故勝。	二四地中，以道品治三地中正受出沒等慢，此用空觀以離作受故勝。	040	Second, in the fourth ground, using the factors of the path to treat the conceit of entering and emerging from meditative absorption, etc. in the third ground, this uses the contemplation of emptiness to be free from action and reception, and therefore it is superior.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c15_14']	三此地方便，但用十平等破顯有無，今此地滿，用深無相破遣有無，一切蕩盡，故此勝也。	三此地方便，但用十平等破顯有無，今此地滿，用深無相破遣有無，一切蕩盡，故此勝也。	040	Third, the expedient means of this ground merely uses the ten equalities to break down and reveal existence and non-existence. Now, in the perfection of this ground, using the profound signlessness to break down and eliminate existence and non-existence, everything is completely exhausted, and therefore it is superior.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c16_10']	第二「大悲轉增」下修行勝，中二：	第二「大悲轉增」下修行勝，中二：	040	The second part, great compassion increases, is the superior practice, which has two parts:

['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c18_4']	「菩提」下兼於自利，亦修所為。	「菩提」下兼於自利，亦修所為。	040	Bodhi and below also includes benefiting oneself, and also cultivates what is to be done.
['ZH_T35_1735_040:0812c19_16']	言悲增者，前觀十平等已起三悲，今十門觀緣，彌悲眾生纏於妄法。	言悲增者，前觀十平等已起三悲，今十門觀緣，彌悲眾生纏於妄法。	040	As for increased compassion, after previously contemplating the ten equalities one gives rise to the three kinds of compassion, now contemplating the ten aspects of conditions, one further feels compassion for sentient beings entangled in false dharmas.
