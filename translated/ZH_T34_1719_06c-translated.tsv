If the mind is equal, then the children must be equal. The mind is the nature of the mind, therefore the Buddha-nature is equal. Because they are all children, the mind is impartial. The wealth and Dharma are also abundant, therefore the mind is equal.

If one thing is not given, it is not called an equal bestowal, namely form, mind, adversity, compliance, reliance, correct, practice, principle, cause, effect, self, other, understanding, delusion, small, great, wisdom, and blessings. Therefore, it is known that the equal bestowal is only revealing that the three vehicles and six destinies are all one suchness. Therefore, each suchness is all-encompassing, all-inclusive, and all-penetrating. All sentient beings have a share of the four-direction ritual arena. Who does not have the principle of the great vehicle and the complete stages? It is only because of waiting for the time and conditions that it is so.

Although there is no horizontal or vertical, the Dharma realm is convenient to speak of horizontally from the perspective of pervasiveness, and the three truths are convenient to speak of vertically from the perspective of the difference in names. The non-duality and mutual manifestation should be contemplated and can be seen.

As soon as he heard the expedient means, he praised the two wisdoms, and upon briefly hearing the revelation, he stirred up attachments and gave rise to doubts.

He extensively heard of the five Buddhas' ten approaches to revealing the provisional, and also saw Śāriputra's three karmas of understanding and the eight groups' examples, and the four assemblies' repayment of kindness. The Tathāgata recounted the completion and clearly gave the prediction.

In terms of the teachings, the meaning of cultivation and attainment is like creation. The differences between nature and cultivation are provisionally called creation. Since there are many practices and many children, the vehicle is not one, and therefore the creations are many and great.

Also, precious silk is spread out on top. Since the various dhyanas are freely mastered, it is called soft and comfortable. The wonderful crowns the coarse, like fine silk covering the top.

The various dhyanas are complete in one practice and one dharma, thus although combined into one, the four characteristics are still distinct.
