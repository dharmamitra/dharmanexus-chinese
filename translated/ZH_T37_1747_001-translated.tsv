It is mentioned in the first scroll, therefore it is called The Sutra on the Buddha of Immeasurable Life, Scroll 1.

['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a01_20']	果德之內略有四門：	果德之內略有四門：	Within the virtuous qualities of the fruition, there are roughly four approaches:
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a03_3']	一淨不淨門、二色無色門、三共不共門、四漏無漏門。	一淨不淨門、二色無色門、三共不共門、四漏無漏門。	1. The approach of purity and impurity, 2. The approach of form and formlessness, 3. The approach of commonality and uniqueness, 4. The approach of having outflows and being without outflows.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a05_18']	第一明淨不淨門者，略以四對顯其階降，謂因與果相對故、一向與不一向相對故、純與雜相對故、正定與非正定相對故。	第一明淨不淨門者，略以四對顯其階降，謂因與果相對故、一向與不一向相對故、純與雜相對故、正定與非正定相對故。	The first is the approach of purity and impurity. It roughly uses four pairs to show the stages, namely: the pair of cause and effect, the pair of one-sided and not one-sided, the pair of pure and mixed, and the pair of correct and incorrect.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a07_18']	所言因與果相對門者，謂金剛以還菩薩所住名果報土，不名淨土，未離苦諦之果患故。	所言因與果相對門者，謂金剛以還菩薩所住名果報土，不名淨土，未離苦諦之果患故。	As for the gate of cause and effect corresponding to each other, it refers to the abode of bodhisattvas up to the vajra stage being called the land of karmic retribution, not the pure land, because they have not yet escaped the suffering of the fruition of the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a08_16']	唯佛所居乃名淨土，一切勞患無餘滅故。	唯佛所居乃名淨土，一切勞患無餘滅故。	Only the abode of the Buddha is called the pure land, because all afflictions and suffering have been completely extinguished.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a10_3']	依此義故，《仁王經》云「三賢十聖住果報，唯佛一人居淨土。	依此義故，《仁王經》云「三賢十聖住果報，唯佛一人居淨土。	Based on this meaning, the Renwang Jing says: The three sages and ten saints abide in the land of karmic retribution, only the Buddha alone dwells in the pure land.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a10_19']	一切眾生暫住報，登金剛源居淨土。	一切眾生暫住報，登金剛源居淨土。	All sentient beings temporarily abide in the land of karmic retribution, but those who ascend to the source of the vajra dwell in the pure land.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a13_7']	」第二、一向與不一向相對門者，謂八地以上菩薩住處得名淨土，以一向出三界事故，亦具四句一向義故。	」第二、一向與不一向相對門者，謂八地以上菩薩住處得名淨土，以一向出三界事故，亦具四句一向義故。	Second, the gate of corresponding to one-sided and not one-sided, refers to the abode of bodhisattvas above the eighth stage being called the pure land, because it is one-sidedly beyond the three realms, and also because it possesses the meaning of the four one-sided aspects.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a16_8']	七地以還一切住處未名淨土，以非一向出三界故，或乘願力出三界者一向四句不具足故，謂一向樂、一向無失、一向自在。	七地以還一切住處未名淨土，以非一向出三界故，或乘願力出三界者一向四句不具足故，謂一向樂、一向無失、一向自在。	All abodes up to the seventh ground are not yet called pure lands, because they are not exclusively beyond the three realms. Those who transcend the three realms by the power of vows are not completely of one kind, because they are exclusively blissful, exclusively without loss, and exclusively sovereign.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a18_9']	七地以還出觀之時，或時生起報無記心，末那四惑于時現行，故非一向淨、非一向無失；	七地以還出觀之時，或時生起報無記心，末那四惑于時現行，故非一向淨、非一向無失；	When those on the seventh ground and below emerge from contemplation, they sometimes give rise to retributive indeterminate minds, and the four delusions of manas are then in active operation. Therefore, they are not exclusively pure and not exclusively without loss.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a18_18']	八地以上即不如是。	八地以上即不如是。	Those on the eighth ground and above are not like this.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a19_22']	依此義故，《攝大乘》云「出出世善法，功能所生起。	依此義故，《攝大乘》云「出出世善法，功能所生起。	Based on this meaning, the Mahāyānasaṃgraha says: The function of the good dharmas that transcend the world gives rise to the good dharmas that transcend the world.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a20_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a20_10']	二乘善，名出世。	二乘善，名出世。	The good dharmas of the two vehicles are called transcending the world.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a21_4', 'ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a21_14']	從八地以上乃至佛地，名出出世。🔽出世法，名世法對治。	從八地以上乃至佛地，名出出世。 出世法，名世法對治。	From the eighth ground and above up to the Buddha ground, they are called transcending the world of the good dharmas that transcend the world.🔽The good dharmas that transcend the world are called the antidotes to worldly dharmas.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a22_5']	出出世法，為出世法對治。	出出世法，為出世法對治。	The good dharmas that transcend the world of the good dharmas that transcend the world are the antidotes to the good dharmas that transcend the world.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a24_3']	功能以四緣為相，從出出世善法功能生起此淨土故，不以集諦為因，乃至廣說故。	功能以四緣為相，從出出世善法功能生起此淨土故，不以集諦為因，乃至廣說故。	The function is characterized by the four conditions, because it gives rise to this pure land from the function of supramundane good dharmas. It is not the cause of the truth of accumulation, and so on, and so forth.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a25_12']	第三、純與雜相對門者，凡夫二乘雜居之處，不得名為清淨世界。	第三、純與雜相對門者，凡夫二乘雜居之處，不得名為清淨世界。	The third, the gate of the contrast between pure and mixed, means that a place where ordinary beings and the two vehicles dwell together cannot be called a pure world.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a26_11']	唯入大地菩薩生處，乃得名為清淨世界。	唯入大地菩薩生處，乃得名為清淨世界。	Only the place where bodhisattvas who have entered the grounds are born can be called a pure world.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a27_1']	彼非純淨，此純淨故。	彼非純淨，此純淨故。	That is not purely pure, but this is purely pure.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126a28_6']	依此義故，《瑜伽論》言「世界無量，有其二種，謂淨不淨。	依此義故，《瑜伽論》言「世界無量，有其二種，謂淨不淨。	Based on this meaning, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says, Worlds are immeasurable, and there are two kinds, namely pure and impure.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b01_8']	」清淨世界中，無那落迦、傍生、餓鬼，亦無欲界、色無色界，純菩薩眾於中止住，是故說名清淨世界。	」清淨世界中，無那落迦、傍生、餓鬼，亦無欲界、色無色界，純菩薩眾於中止住，是故說名清淨世界。	In the pure worlds, there are no hells, animals, hungry ghosts, nor the desire realm, form realm, or formless realm. It is purely the assembly of bodhisattvas who dwell there, and therefore it is called a pure world.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b03_1']	已入第三地菩薩，由願力故，於彼受生，無有異生及非異生聲聞獨覺。	已入第三地菩薩，由願力故，於彼受生，無有異生及非異生聲聞獨覺。	Bodhisattvas who have entered the third ground, by the power of their vows, take birth there, without being ordinary beings or non-ordinary beings, śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b03_15']	若非異生菩薩得生於彼，解云：	若非異生菩薩得生於彼，解云：	If non-ordinary beings, bodhisattvas can be born there, it is explained:
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b05_13']	此第三地是歡喜地，以就七種菩薩地門第三淨勝意樂地故，攝十三位、立七種地。	此第三地是歡喜地，以就七種菩薩地門第三淨勝意樂地故，攝十三位、立七種地。	This third ground is the ground of joy. Because it is the third ground of pure superior intention in the seven types of bodhisattva grounds, it includes thirteen stages and establishes seven types of grounds.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b06_2']	具如彼論之所說故。	具如彼論之所說故。	Because it is fully as explained in that treatise.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b08_4']	第四正定與非正定相對門者，三聚眾生苦生之地是為穢土，唯正定聚所居之處名為淨土。	第四正定與非正定相對門者，三聚眾生苦生之地是為穢土，唯正定聚所居之處名為淨土。	The fourth gate of correct and incorrect determination is that the land where beings in the three groups are born in suffering is a defiled land, and only the place where those in the correct determination group dwell is called a pure land.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b09_13']	於中亦有四果聲聞，乃至復有四疑凡夫，唯無邪定及不定聚耳。	於中亦有四果聲聞，乃至復有四疑凡夫，唯無邪定及不定聚耳。	Within it, there are also four fruition śrāvakas, up to and including four doubtful ordinary beings, but only without the incorrect determination and undetermined groups.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b10_12']	今此經說無量壽國，就第四門說為淨土。	今此經說無量壽國，就第四門說為淨土。	The Sutra of Immeasurable Life now explains the land of immeasurable life as a pure land, using the fourth gate.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b11_20']	所以然者，為欲普容大小、兼引凡聖，竝生勝處、同趣大道故。	所以然者，為欲普容大小、兼引凡聖，竝生勝處、同趣大道故。	The reason for this is to universally accommodate both the great and the small, to guide both the ordinary and the sages, to be born together in the superior place, and to equally pursue the great path.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b13_10']	如下文言「設我得佛，國中人民不住正定聚必至滅度者，不取正覺。	如下文言「設我得佛，國中人民不住正定聚必至滅度者，不取正覺。	As stated in the following text, If I attain Buddhahood, and the people in my country do not abide in the right concentration, but must attain extinction, I will not attain perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b14_16']	」又言「設我得佛，國中聲聞，有能計量知其數者，不取正覺。	」又言「設我得佛，國中聲聞，有能計量知其數者，不取正覺。	It also says, If I attain Buddhahood, and the śrāvakas in my country can calculate and know their number, I will not attain perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b15_1']	」乃至廣說。	」乃至廣說。	And so on, it is explained in detail.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b16_3']	又《觀經》中說「生彼國已，得羅漢果」等，乃至廣說故。	又《觀經》中說「生彼國已，得羅漢果」等，乃至廣說故。	It is also said in the Guanjing (Contemplation Sutra) that after being born in that country, one attains the fruit of arhatship and so on, and it is explained in detail.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b17_17']	論說云「女人及根缺，二乘種不生」者，是說決定種性二乘，非謂不定根性聲聞。	論說云「女人及根缺，二乘種不生」者，是說決定種性二乘，非謂不定根性聲聞。	The treatise says, Women and those with incomplete faculties, the seeds of the two vehicles will not be born there. This refers to those of the definite two vehicle lineages, not to the indeterminate śrāvaka lineage.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b18_8']	為簡此故，名二乘種。	為簡此故，名二乘種。	In order to distinguish this, it is called the seeds of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b18_18']	由是義故，不相違也。	由是義故，不相違也。	For this reason, there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b20_16']	又言女人及根缺者，謂生彼時非女非根缺耳，非此女等不得往生，如韋提希而得生故。	又言女人及根缺者，謂生彼時非女非根缺耳，非此女等不得往生，如韋提希而得生故。	Also, it is said that women and those with incomplete faculties are not women or those with incomplete faculties when born there, but it is not that women and so forth cannot be born there, because Vaidehī was able to be born there.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b23_7']	然《鼓音王陀羅尼經》云「阿彌陀佛，父名月上轉輪聖王，其母名曰殊勝妙眼」等，乃至廣說者，是說化佛所居化土。	然《鼓音王陀羅尼經》云「阿彌陀佛，父名月上轉輪聖王，其母名曰殊勝妙眼」等，乃至廣說者，是說化佛所居化土。	However, the Drum Sound King Dhāraṇī Sūtra says, Amitābha Buddha's father is the Moon-Sovereign Wheel-Turning Sage King, and his mother is called the Most Excellent and Wonderful Eye, and so forth, explaining in detail. This is speaking of the transformed Buddha dwelling in the transformed land.

['ZH_T37_1747_001:0126b27_3']	上來四門所說淨土，皆是如來願行所成，非生彼者自力所辨，不如穢土外器世界，唯由眾生共業所成，是故通名清淨土也。	上來四門所說淨土，皆是如來願行所成，非生彼者自力所辨，不如穢土外器世界，唯由眾生共業所成，是故通名清淨土也。	The pure lands spoken of in the above four approaches are all accomplished through the Tathāgata's vows and practices. Those born there do not accomplish them by their own power, unlike the external vessel world of the defiled lands, which is accomplished solely by the common karma of sentient beings.

['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c10_5']	一者有法一向有漏，謂諸染污心心所法等，由相應義是有漏故，而無五種無漏相故。	一者有法一向有漏，謂諸染污心心所法等，由相應義是有漏故，而無五種無漏相故。	First, there are dharmas that are exclusively contaminated. This refers to defiled mind and mental factors, etc., because they are contaminated by the meaning of association, but they lack the five kinds of uncontaminated characteristics.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c12_4']	二者有法一向無漏，謂見道時心心所法等，由有自性解脫義故，而無五種有漏相故。	二者有法一向無漏，謂見道時心心所法等，由有自性解脫義故，而無五種有漏相故。	Second, there are dharmas that are exclusively uncontaminated. This refers to mind and mental factors at the time of the path of insight, etc., because they have the meaning of intrinsic liberation, but they lack the five kinds of contaminated characteristics.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c14_16']	三者有法亦有漏亦無漏，謂報無記心心所法等，隨眠所縛故、諸纏所離故，雖復無漏而是苦諦，由業煩惱所生起故。	三者有法亦有漏亦無漏，謂報無記心心所法等，隨眠所縛故、諸纏所離故，雖復無漏而是苦諦，由業煩惱所生起故。	Third, there are dharmas that are both contaminated and uncontaminated. This refers to retribution-neutral mind and mental factors, etc., because they are bound by the latent afflictions, and because they are free from the entanglements, although they are uncontaminated, they are still the truth of suffering, because they arise from karma and afflictions.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c15_14']	四者有法非有漏，謂甚深法不墮數故。	四者有法非有漏，謂甚深法不墮數故。	Fourth, there are dharmas that are neither contaminated nor uncontaminated. This refers to the profound Dharma, which does not fall into categories.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c16_4']	次別明中亦有二門：	次別明中亦有二門：	Next, in the specific explanation, there are also two approaches:
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c16_16']	一有分際門、二無障礙門。	一有分際門、二無障礙門。	First, the approach of having boundaries; second, the approach of unobstructedness.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c18_1']	有分際門者，若就諸佛所居淨土，於四句中唯有二句。	有分際門者，若就諸佛所居淨土，於四句中唯有二句。	As for the section on having boundaries, if we discuss the pure lands inhabited by buddhas, there are only two of the four phrases.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c19_13']	依有色有心門，即一向是無漏，自性相續解脫義故、遠離五種有漏相故。	依有色有心門，即一向是無漏，自性相續解脫義故、遠離五種有漏相故。	Relying on the section on having form and having mind, it is exclusively uncontaminated, because it is by nature continuous liberation, and because it is far removed from the five kinds of contaminated characteristics.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c21_4']	若就非色非心門者，即非有漏亦非無漏，非有非無故、離相離性故。	若就非色非心門者，即非有漏亦非無漏，非有非無故、離相離性故。	If we discuss the section on neither form nor mind, then it is neither contaminated nor uncontaminated, because it is neither existent nor nonexistent, and because it is free from characteristics and free from nature.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c22_13']	若就菩薩，亦有二句，恰論二智，所顯淨土，一向無漏，道諦所攝。	若就菩薩，亦有二句，恰論二智，所顯淨土，一向無漏，道諦所攝。	If we discuss bodhisattvas, there are also two phrases. Discussing the two kinds of knowledge, the pure lands revealed are exclusively uncontaminated, subsumed within the truth of the path.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c23_17']	如《攝論》說「菩薩及如來唯識智，無相無功用，故言清淨。	如《攝論》說「菩薩及如來唯識智，無相無功用，故言清淨。	As the Compendium of the Great Vehicle Treatise says, The knowledge of consciousness-only of bodhisattvas and tathāgatas is free from characteristics and effortless, and therefore said to be pure.

['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c25_9']	此唯識智，為淨土體故，不以苦諦為體。	此唯識智，為淨土體故，不以苦諦為體。	This knowledge of consciousness-only is the essence of the pure land, and therefore it is not taken as having the truth of suffering as its essence.

['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c27_8']	若就本識所變之門，亦是無漏，以非三界有漏所起，樂無漏界，故是無漏。	若就本識所變之門，亦是無漏，以非三界有漏所起，樂無漏界，故是無漏。	If we discuss it from the perspective of the transformation of the root consciousness, it is also pure, because it is not produced by the contaminated of the three realms, and it is the realm of delight in purity, so it is pure.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c28_7']	無明住地為緣出故，名果報土，故是有漏。	無明住地為緣出故，名果報土，故是有漏。	Because it arises with the store consciousness of ignorance as a condition, it is called the retribution land, so it is contaminated.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0127c29_14']	雖亦無漏而是世間，故於無作四諦門內，苦諦果報之所攝也。	雖亦無漏而是世間，故於無作四諦門內，苦諦果報之所攝也。	Although it is also pure, it is still the mundane world, so within the four truths of the truth of suffering is subsumed.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0128a01_8']	如經言「三賢十聖住果報」故。	如經言「三賢十聖住果報」故。	As a sutra says: The three worthies and ten sages abide in the retribution.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0128a03_2']	《寶性論》云「依無漏界中，有三種意生身，應知彼因無漏善根所作，名為世間；	《寶性論》云「依無漏界中，有三種意生身，應知彼因無漏善根所作，名為世間；	The Mahāyāna-śraddhotpāda-śāstra says: Based on the uncontaminated realm, there are three kinds of mind-born bodies.

['ZH_T37_1747_001:0128a04_19']	」依此義故，《勝鬘經》言「世尊！	」依此義故，《勝鬘經》言「世尊！	Based on this meaning, the Śrīmālā-sūtra says: World-Honored One!

['ZH_T37_1747_001:0128a06_15']	」故此中說意生身，乃是梨耶所變正報。	」故此中說意生身，乃是梨耶所變正報。	Therefore, in this context, the mind-born body is the direct retribution transformed by the store consciousness.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0128a07_15']	正報既爾，依報亦然，同是本識所變作故。	正報既爾，依報亦然，同是本識所變作故。	Since the direct retribution is like this, the dependent environment is also the same, because they are both transformed by the fundamental consciousness.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0128a09_14']	然此梨耶所變之土，及與二智所現淨土，雖為苦道二諦所攝，而無別體，隨義異攝耳。	然此梨耶所變之土，及與二智所現淨土，雖為苦道二諦所攝，而無別體，隨義異攝耳。	However, the land transformed by this store consciousness, and the pure land manifested by the two kinds of wisdom, although included in the two truths of suffering and the path, they have no separate substance, but are only subsumed differently according to their different meanings.
['ZH_T37_1747_001:0128a11_2']	如他分別所持穢土，得清淨者即見為淨，淨穢雖異而無別體。	如他分別所持穢土，得清淨者即見為淨，淨穢雖異而無別體。	Just as the defiled land held by the discrimination of others, when it becomes pure, it is seen as pure. Although purity and impurity are different, they have no separate substance.
