['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a12_6']	」親友是十六王子，云何言子與眾生煩惱？	」親友是十六王子，云何言子與眾生煩惱？	007	The close friend is the sixteen princes. How can it be said that the princes give sentient beings afflictions?
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a13_15']	諸佛聖人不為眾生作煩惱因緣，故知入餘處飲酒來至親友家。	諸佛聖人不為眾生作煩惱因緣，故知入餘處飲酒來至親友家。	007	The buddhas and sages do not create conditions for sentient beings' afflictions. Therefore, it is known that they drink alcohol elsewhere and come to the close friend's home.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a15_9']	下言「其家甚大富具設諸餚饍」，自有人一日恒設󰉔菓，只自無有酒也。	下言「其家甚大富具設諸餚饍」，自有人一日恒設󰉔菓，只自無有酒也。	007	Below it says, The family is very wealthy and has prepared various delicacies. There are people who always set out fruits every day, but they themselves do not have alcohol.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a17_8']	「官事當行」者非是初行，內合于時十六王子覆講緣既盡更為餘方便法，故言官事行也。	「官事當行」者非是初行，內合于時十六王子覆講緣既盡更為餘方便法，故言官事行也。	007	Official business to attend to does not refer to the initial practice. Internally, at that time the sixteen princes had finished the conditions of the subcommentary and again used other expedient methods, so it is said official business to attend to.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a19_17']	「寶珠繫其衣裏」十六王子于時覆講為眾生說大乘，今于時眾生相與得解大乘，大乘之理最貴，故言無價。	「寶珠繫其衣裏」十六王子于時覆講為眾生說大乘，今于時眾生相與得解大乘，大乘之理最貴，故言無價。	007	The precious jewel tied inside the clothing means that at that time the sixteen princes subcommented and explained the Mahayana for sentient beings. Now at this time sentient beings mutually attain the understanding of the Mahayana. The principle of the Mahayana is most precious, so it is said to be priceless.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a22_2']	此大乘解可珍可重如寶，其理必圓如珠為因之義，不亡名為繫，既是外凡不亡壞，故言衣裏也。	此大乘解可珍可重如寶，其理必圓如珠為因之義，不亡名為繫，既是外凡不亡壞，故言衣裏也。	007	This understanding of the Mahayana can be treasured and respected like a jewel. Its principle must be perfect like a jewel. The meaning of being the cause is not lost, so it is said to be tied. Since it is the outer stage of ordinary beings, it is not lost or destroyed, so it is said to be inside the clothing.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a23_2']	「其人醉臥都不覺知」，此是第二不自覺知譬。	「其人醉臥都不覺知」，此是第二不自覺知譬。	007	The person is drunk and lying down, completely unaware is the second analogy of not being self-aware.

Internally, it combines the sixteen princes of the past who, having been taught the Mahayana and attained the understanding of practicing the Mahayana, the princes then went to other lands, and sentient beings consequently lost the understanding of the Mahayana. Since losing that understanding, they have never been aware that they have the understanding of the Mahayana, not knowing that this means they lack the capacity for the Mahayana.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658a28_14']	「起已遊行」此下是第三行他國譬，內合眾生既無大乘根機唯有小機，從小乘教修行求因覓果。	「起已遊行」此下是第三行他國譬，內合眾生既無大乘根機唯有小機，從小乘教修行求因覓果。	007	Having arisen, they wandered - this is the third parable of traveling to other countries, internally combining sentient beings who, having no capacity for the Mahayana, only have the capacity for the Hinayana, practicing and seeking causes and effects according to the teachings of the Hinayana.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b03_1']	此則領上設化城譬，上譬中本有四重，一者用化城擬宜，二者有堪聞化城之機，三者正為設化城，此三階今者都不領，唯領第四諸人受行。	此則領上設化城譬，上譬中本有四重，一者用化城擬宜，二者有堪聞化城之機，三者正為設化城，此三階今者都不領，唯領第四諸人受行。	007	This then corresponds to the parable of setting up the illusory city. In the original parable, there were four layers: first, using the illusory city to suit their capacities; second, there were capacities that could hear about the illusory city; third, directly setting up the illusory city. These three steps are not corresponded to at all now, only the fourth, all the people accepting and practicing, is corresponded to.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b06_2']	上受行中自有四階，今者亦具領四階，一者言「起已遊行」此則領上「是時疲極之眾心大歡喜」，明外凡夫修行即是「心各勇銳」聞法信受。	上受行中自有四階，今者亦具領四階，一者言「起已遊行」此則領上「是時疲極之眾心大歡喜」，明外凡夫修行即是「心各勇銳」聞法信受。	007	The upper part on receiving and practicing has four stages, and now it also fully includes the four stages. First, it says having arisen, they wander and roam, which then includes the above the exhausted multitude greatly rejoiced, clarifying that the practice of ordinary beings is precisely the each being courageous and sharp, hearing the Dharma and believing in it.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b08_4']	二者言「到於他國」此則領上言「我等今者免斯惡道」即是內凡夫修行，信道五根立故言他國。	二者言「到於他國」此則領上言「我等今者免斯惡道」即是內凡夫修行，信道五根立故言他國。	007	Second, it says they arrive at another country, which then includes the above statement we are now free from this evil path, which is the practice of the inner ordinary beings, because the five roots of faith in the path are established, it is said to be another country.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b09_19']	三者「為衣食故懃力」，此則領上於是眾人前見諦思惟治道即是「競共馳走」。	三者「為衣食故懃力」，此則領上於是眾人前見諦思惟治道即是「競共馳走」。	007	Third, it says for the sake of clothing and food, they diligently exert themselves, which then includes the above in front of the multitude, seeing the truth and contemplating the path, which is precisely competing to run together.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b11_21']	四者言「若少有所得便以為足」，此則領上入化城生已度想，明無學果，即「諍出火宅」義也。	四者言「若少有所得便以為足」，此則領上入化城生已度想，明無學果，即「諍出火宅」義也。	007	Fourth, it says if they obtain a little, they consider it sufficient, which then includes entering the transformed city and giving rise to the thought of having already crossed over, clarifying the fruit of no-more learning, which is precisely the meaning of struggling to exit the burning house.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b14_10']	「於後親友會遇見之」此是第四相值譬，此則領上知止息譬，言「爾時導師知此人眾既得止息」下，明大乘機發也。	「於後親友會遇見之」此是第四相值譬，此則領上知止息譬，言「爾時導師知此人眾既得止息」下，明大乘機發也。	007	Later, the close friend encountered him - this is the fourth analogy of meeting, which corresponds to the above analogy of knowing to rest, stating At that time, the guide knew that this group of people had already rested - it clarifies that the Mahayana potential has been activated.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b17_14']	「而作是言咄哉丈夫」，此下是第五示寶珠譬，此則領化城中即滅化城將至寶所譬，亦遠領火宅、〈方便品〉今行大乘因取大乘果，故名貿易所須也。	「而作是言咄哉丈夫」，此下是第五示寶珠譬，此則領化城中即滅化城將至寶所譬，亦遠領火宅、〈方便品〉今行大乘因取大乘果，故名貿易所須也。	007	And said, 'Alas, good man!' - this is the fifth analogy of showing the precious pearl, which corresponds to the analogy in the chapter on the illusory city of immediately extinguishing the illusory city and heading to the place of treasures, and also corresponds to the burning house and the chapter on skillful means of taking the Mahayana cause and attaining the Mahayana fruition, thus it is called trading what is needed.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b19_1']	此下應有第六歡喜，文中闕者今且懸出，對下合譬也。	此下應有第六歡喜，文中闕者今且懸出，對下合譬也。	007	Below this, there should be a sixth joy, but the text is missing. I will now temporarily present it separately to correspond with the combined analogy below.

['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b22_12']	「為菩薩時即合親友教化我等令發一切智心」，即合以無價寶珠繫其衣裏也。	「為菩薩時即合親友教化我等令發一切智心」，即合以無價寶珠繫其衣裏也。	007	When you were a bodhisattva, you should have befriended us and taught us to give rise to the mind of omniscience, which corresponds to tying the priceless jewel in the lining of our clothes.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0658b23_15']	「而尋廢忘不知不覺」此則合上第二不自覺知也。	「而尋廢忘不知不覺」此則合上第二不自覺知也。	007	But we have forgotten and do not know or realize it, this corresponds to the second part above, not being self-aware.

Seeing at the end of the chapter on upholding that the great bodhisattvas circulated the sutra in this evil world, with the fault of being expelled and the danger to their lives, they said, We have not yet reached the great beings, so how can we circulate this sutra in this evil world?

['ZH_T33_1715_007:0659c05_9']	就現在明下品法師中有二階：	就現在明下品法師中有二階：	007	In clarifying the lower level Dharma teachers when the Buddha was in the world, there are two steps:

['ZH_T33_1715_007:0659c28_2']	今者第一見受持讀誦者不可輕毀，所以謗罪重於佛者，正由謗此人，故今《法華》不通，遂斷三寶之種，故所以罪重也；	今者第一見受持讀誦者不可輕毀，所以謗罪重於佛者，正由謗此人，故今《法華》不通，遂斷三寶之種，故所以罪重也；	007	Now, the first is that one should not lightly slander or denigrate those who uphold, read, and recite it. The reason why the offense of slander is heavier than that of the Buddha is precisely because by slandering this person, one now obstructs the Lotus Sutra and thus severs the seeds of the Three Jewels, which is why the offense is heavy.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0659c28_20']	雖謗如來，不能令三寶永斷，故言罪輕。	雖謗如來，不能令三寶永斷，故言罪輕。	007	Even if one slanders the Tathāgata, one cannot cause the Three Jewels to be permanently severed, so it says the offense is light.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0659c29_12']	只取一邊，不論福田厚薄也。	只取一邊，不論福田厚薄也。	007	It only takes one side, not discussing the thickness of the field of merit.

They are carried on the shoulders of the Tathāgata means that this person is valued by the Tathāgata, so it says carried, not that the Tathāgata himself carries them.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0660a04_13']	「其所至方」此下是第二明從之者得福，亦有二，有正、有釋，即是報深也。	「其所至方」此下是第二明從之者得福，亦有二，有正、有釋，即是報深也。	007	Wherever they go and below is the second clarification of the blessings obtained by following them. It also has two parts: the main point and the explanation, which is the profound retribution.

There are four chapters of sutra, which are divided into three sections. The first two chapters of the sutra, Chapter on Dharma Teachers and Seeing the Treasure Pagoda, first clarify that the merits of those who propagate the sutra are profound, and the rewards of those who uphold it are great. They seek those who can propagate the sutra. The second chapter, Chapter on Upholding, clarifies that the assembly of those who accumulate blessings and enjoy goodness, together in front of the Buddha, make vows and accept the mission to propagate the sutra. They all say that they do not cherish their bodies and lives, but value the unsurpassed Way.

It says that if one can possess these four practices, the celestial demons will not be able to disturb them, and they will be able to forget themselves and benefit others, drowning their lives and delivering people, in the evil world. This means that those of the lower grade will give rise to the mind of widely transmitting the sutra because of this, and will further give rise to the intention of delivering people.

Therefore, within the gate of wisdom, expounding the Dharma is distinguished. Within the gate of merits, compassion is distinguished. Therefore, there are four practices.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0662c25_10']	第三自行外化判者，第一第三是自行，第四同是外化凡通經之法，不過自行外化。	第三自行外化判者，第一第三是自行，第四同是外化凡通經之法，不過自行外化。	007	Third, in terms of distinguishing personal practice and transforming others, the first and third are personal practice, and the fourth is transforming others.

['ZH_T33_1715_007:0662c28_19']	自行分為二者，有兩義故，一者第一是照假實二空之解，此是智門，第三明離過，此是斷門，所以自行須明二也。	自行分為二者，有兩義故，一者第一是照假實二空之解，此是智門，第三明離過，此是斷門，所以自行須明二也。	007	The division into two for one's own practice has two meanings. First, the first is the understanding that illuminates the two emptinesses of provisional and real. This is the gate of wisdom. The third clarifies the avoidance of faults. This is the gate of elimination. Therefore, one's own practice must clarify these two.

This is the good of cessation. Since there is a distinction between cessation and practice, it is divided into two.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0663a04_9']	外化所以分為二者，若語慈悲則談其本，若語其說法則論其末，若使但有知說法無有慈悲者，是則如無記語；	外化所以分為二者，若語慈悲則談其本，若語其說法則論其末，若使但有知說法無有慈悲者，是則如無記語；	007	The reason for dividing external transformation into two is that if one speaks of compassion, it discusses the root. If one discusses the teaching of the Dharma, it discusses the branches. If one only knows how to teach the Dharma without compassion, then it is like neutral speech.
['ZH_T33_1715_007:0663a06_6']	若使但有慈悲無有說法者，是則與樂拔苦之行終不能成，故以外化須明此二也。	若使但有慈悲無有說法者，是則與樂拔苦之行終不能成，故以外化須明此二也。	007	If one only has compassion without teaching the Dharma, then the practice of bestowing happiness and removing suffering will ultimately not be accomplished.
