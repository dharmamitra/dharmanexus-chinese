Although the previous chapters briefly clarify emptiness, they have not yet been fully and correctly discussed. Now, in order to clarify the realm, this chapter arises.

['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0272c15_12']	若云舜若空即是性，云舜若多即空之性，故《解深密》等云「相無自性性、生無自性性、勝義無自性性。	若云舜若空即是性，云舜若多即空之性，故《解深密》等云「相無自性性、生無自性性、勝義無自性性。	If it is said that śūnya is the nature, and śūnyatā is the nature of emptiness, then the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, etc., say, The nature of characteristics having no self-nature, the nature of arising having no self-nature, and the nature of the ultimate truth having no self-nature.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0272c16_2']	」故三無性俱得云性。	」故三無性俱得云性。	Therefore, the three natures without self-nature can all be called natures.

Although other sūtras explain it in detail, it is still not fully known. Now it is explained again, so it is called The Chapter on Manifesting the Nature of Emptiness Again.

['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c17_4']	此有四喻：	此有四喻：	There are four metaphors here:
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c18_3']	一水月喻，喻無外境，而定心所行境得成。	一水月喻，喻無外境，而定心所行境得成。	The first is the metaphor of the moon in water, which illustrates that there are no external objects, but the objects of the concentrated mind can be accomplished.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c18_19']	如水為緣，雖水中無月，有月影起。	如水為緣，雖水中無月，有月影起。	Just as water is a condition, although there is no moon in the water, a moon-like reflection arises.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c20_8']	我今亦爾，從定願心現諸境界，雖無實身等，為利眾生而似身境生。	我今亦爾，從定願心現諸境界，雖無實身等，為利眾生而似身境生。	I am also like this now. From the mind of concentration and vows, various realms appear. Although there are no real bodies, etc., for the sake of benefiting sentient beings, bodies and objects arise as if they were real.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c22_12']	月影既不行，我身亦不行，此除遍計性，謂定所取境離心實有，故舉水月喻，雖無月境而似月生。	月影既不行，我身亦不行，此除遍計性，謂定所取境離心實有，故舉水月喻，雖無月境而似月生。	Since the moon's reflection does not move, my body also does not move. This eliminates the imagined nature, which refers to the definitely grasped object, which is apart from the mind and is truly existent. Therefore, the metaphor of the water moon is used. Although there is no moon object, it appears as if the moon is born.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c23_14']	二夢境喻，喻無心外愛憎之境，而有愛憎境增生。	二夢境喻，喻無心外愛憎之境，而有愛憎境增生。	Second, the metaphor of dream objects, which illustrates that there are no objects of love and hatred outside the mind, but there is the arising of objects of love and hatred.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c25_12']	如雖受彼三界六道愛非愛身，行菩提行，如夢所見愛非愛身行菩提行，不取為真。	如雖受彼三界六道愛非愛身，行菩提行，如夢所見愛非愛身行菩提行，不取為真。	Although one experiences the bodies of love and non-love in the three realms and six paths, practicing the conduct of enlightenment, it is like the bodies of love and non-love seen in a dream practicing the conduct of enlightenment, not grasping them as real.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c27_7']	三陽焰喻，能取心心所迷亂故緣所取境，雖非是實而有似境生，非真實有。	三陽焰喻，能取心心所迷亂故緣所取境，雖非是實而有似境生，非真實有。	Third, the metaphor of a mirage, which illustrates that the grasping mind and mental factors are deluded, so although the grasped objects are not real, there is the arising of objects that resemble them, not truly existing.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0281c28_9']	菩薩以無分別智，於三輪境應如是知，無有真實。	菩薩以無分別智，於三輪境應如是知，無有真實。	Bodhisattvas should understand the three wheels of objects in this way with non-discriminating cognition, without true existence.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0282a01_2']	四谷響喻，所起語業化眾生時如谷響聲，谷實無聲，但自出聲似彼谷響。	四谷響喻，所起語業化眾生時如谷響聲，谷實無聲，但自出聲似彼谷響。	Fourth, the metaphor of an echo, which illustrates that when the spoken karma arises to transform beings, it is like an echo. The valley is actually without sound, but it produces sounds that resemble the echo in the valley.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0282a02_18']	故知菩薩為他說法觀如谷聲，由他緣現但似谷聲說法利生，實非出聲為他說法。	故知菩薩為他說法觀如谷聲，由他緣現但似谷聲說法利生，實非出聲為他說法。	Therefore, it should be known that when bodhisattvas expound the Dharma for others, they view it as like an echo. Due to the conditions of others, it merely appears as if they are expounding the Dharma and benefiting beings with an echo, but in reality they do not expound the Dharma for others by emitting a sound.
['ZH_T39_1788_04b:0282a03_18']	如是行菩提行，如無性《攝大乘》第四說。	如是行菩提行，如無性《攝大乘》第四說。	Practicing the conduct of enlightenment in this way is as explained in Asvabhāva's fourth chapter of the Mahāyānasaṃgrahabhāṣya.
