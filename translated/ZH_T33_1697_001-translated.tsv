['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068b27_2']	第一、述大意者，夫波若為至道也，無道非道、無至不至，蕭焉無所不寂、泰然無所不蕩，是知實相無相故無所不相、真照無明故無不為明。	第一、述大意者，夫波若為至道也，無道非道、無至不至，蕭焉無所不寂、泰然無所不蕩，是知實相無相故無所不相、真照無明故無不為明。	001	First, as for stating the general meaning, prajñā is the ultimate Way. There is no Way that is not the Way, and no destination that is not reached. It is empty and tranquil, yet nothing is not寂; it is vast and free, yet nothing is not蕩. Thus, knowing that the true aspect is without characteristics, there is nothing that is not characterized; the true illumination is without ignorance, so there is nothing that is not illuminated.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068b27_18']	無明無不明者，誰滅癡闇而得慧明？	無明無不明者，誰滅癡闇而得慧明？	001	Where there is no ignorance or lack of illumination, who can eliminate delusion and darkness to attain the illumination of wisdom?
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068b28_14']	無相無非相者，豈壞假名而說實相？	無相無非相者，豈壞假名而說實相？	001	Where there are no characteristics or lack of characteristics, how can one destroy provisional names and speak of the true aspect?
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c01_7']	斯則假名妄相無非真性，而四辨不能說其相，實相般若玄之又玄之也；	斯則假名妄相無非真性，而四辨不能說其相，實相般若玄之又玄之也；	001	Thus, the false characteristics of provisional names are none other than the true nature, and the four types of eloquence cannot describe its characteristics. The true aspect of prajñā is profound and mysterious.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c02_17']	貪染癡闇皆是慧明，而五眼不能見其照，觀照波若損之又損之也。	貪染癡闇皆是慧明，而五眼不能見其照，觀照波若損之又損之也。	001	Greed, defilement, and ignorance are all the illumination of wisdom, yet the five eyes cannot see its illumination. The observation and illumination of prajñā eliminates them again and again.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c04_6']	今是經者，波若為宗，無說無示、無聞無得，絕諸戲論之格言也。	今是經者，波若為宗，無說無示、無聞無得，絕諸戲論之格言也。	001	Now this sūtra takes prajñā as its essence. Without speaking, without demonstrating, without hearing, without attaining, it cuts off all the conventional expressions of idle speculation.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c06_18']	無所示故無所不示、無所得故無所不得，六度萬行於之圓滿、五眼萬德從是生成，菩薩之要藏也、諸佛之真母也。	無所示故無所不示、無所得故無所不得，六度萬行於之圓滿、五眼萬德從是生成，菩薩之要藏也、諸佛之真母也。	001	Because there is nothing to demonstrate, there is nothing that is not demonstrated; because there is nothing to attain, there is nothing that is not attained. The six pāramitās and myriad practices are perfected within it, and the five eyes and myriad virtues are born from it. It is the essential treasury of bodhisattvas and the true mother of all buddhas.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c11_7']	所以無上法王將說是經，尊重波若親自敷坐，天雨四華以供養、地動六變而警喜，十方大士最在邊而遠來、二界諸天下高光而遐至，常啼七歲立之不顧骨髓之摧、河天一座聞之便得菩提之記。	所以無上法王將說是經，尊重波若親自敷坐，天雨四華以供養、地動六變而警喜，十方大士最在邊而遠來、二界諸天下高光而遐至，常啼七歲立之不顧骨髓之摧、河天一座聞之便得菩提之記。	001	Therefore, when the unsurpassed Dharma King was about to expound this sūtra, he revered prajñā and personally sat down. The heavens rained down four kinds of flowers as offerings, and the earth trembled in six ways to alert and delight. Great beings from the ten directions came from far away, even from the edges, and beings from the two realms descended from high in the sky and arrived from afar. Sadāprarudita stood for seven years without regard for the destruction of his bones and marrow, and when Gaṅgadevā heard it for just one session, she immediately received the prediction of attaining enlightenment.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c12_17']	至如唐虞之蓋天下、周孔之冠群仙，而猶諸天設教不敢逆於天則。	至如唐虞之蓋天下、周孔之冠群仙，而猶諸天設教不敢逆於天則。	001	Even if Tang and Yu covered the world and Zhou and Kong crowned the multitude of immortals, they still would not dare to go against the principles of heaven in establishing their teachings.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c14_1']	今我法王波若真典，諸天奉而仰信，不敢違於佛教。	今我法王波若真典，諸天奉而仰信，不敢違於佛教。	001	Now, the true scriptures of prajñā of our Dharma King are revered and trusted by the gods, who do not dare to violate the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c14_20']	以此而推，去彼遠矣，豈可同日而論乎哉？	以此而推，去彼遠矣，豈可同日而論乎哉？	001	Judging from this, they are far removed from each other. How can they be discussed on the same day?
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c16_3']	爾乃信受四句，福廣虛空，捨恒沙之身命所不能況；	爾乃信受四句，福廣虛空，捨恒沙之身命所不能況；	001	Then, believing and accepting four sentences, the merit is as vast as space, and cannot be compared to giving up as many bodies and lives as the sands of the Ganges River;
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c17_6']	起謗一念，罪重五逆，墮千劫之無間猶不能償者也。	起謗一念，罪重五逆，墮千劫之無間猶不能償者也。	001	Giving rise to a single thought of slander, the sin is heavier than the five heinous crimes, and even falling into the Avīci Hell for a thousand kalpas cannot repay it.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c18_12']	所言摩訶般若波羅蜜者，皆是彼語，此土譯之云大慧度。	所言摩訶般若波羅蜜者，皆是彼語，此土譯之云大慧度。	001	As for what is said to be Mahāprajñāpāramitā, they are all his words, translated in this land as Great Wisdom and Crossing.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c19_7']	由無所知無所不知，故名為慧；	由無所知無所不知，故名為慧；	001	Because there is nothing to know and nothing not to know, it is called wisdom;
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c20_1']	無所到故無所不到，乃名為度。	無所到故無所不到，乃名為度。	001	Because there is nowhere to reach and nowhere not to reach, it is called crossing.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c21_13']	由如是故無所不能，能生無上大人、能顯無邊大果，以此義故名大慧度。	由如是故無所不能，能生無上大人、能顯無邊大果，以此義故名大慧度。	001	For this reason, there is nothing that cannot be done, and it can give rise to the unsurpassed great person and manifest the boundless great fruit. For this meaning, it is called the perfection of great wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c22_4']	所言經者，常也、法也。	所言經者，常也、法也。	001	As for the term sutra, it means constant and Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c22_20']	常性無所有，故先賢後聖之常軌也；	常性無所有，故先賢後聖之常軌也；	001	The nature of constancy does not exist, so it is the constant practice of the sages of the past and present;
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c23_15']	法相畢竟空，故反流歸源之真則也。	法相畢竟空，故反流歸源之真則也。	001	The characteristics of Dharma are ultimately empty, so it is the true principle of reversing the flow and returning to the source.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c24_14']	此經六百有十六分，在前四百以為初分。	此經六百有十六分，在前四百以為初分。	001	This sutra has 616 chapters, of which the first 400 are considered the first part.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c26_6']	初分之內有七十八品，於中在前明起經之緣，故言初分緣起品第一。	初分之內有七十八品，於中在前明起經之緣，故言初分緣起品第一。	001	Within the first part there are 78 chapters, of which the first clarifies the conditions for the arising of the sutra, so it is called the first chapter on the conditions for the arising of the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c27_16']	第二、顯經宗者，此經正以波若為宗。	第二、顯經宗者，此經正以波若為宗。	001	Second, to reveal the main purport of the sutra, the main purport of this sutra is prajna.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c28_6']	通而言之，波若有三：	通而言之，波若有三：	001	Speaking in general terms, there are three kinds of prajna:
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c29_3']	一文字波若、二實相波若、三觀照波若。	一文字波若、二實相波若、三觀照波若。	001	First, written prajna; second, prajna of the true aspect; third, prajna of contemplation and illumination.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0068c29_13']	今此經者，後二為宗。	今此經者，後二為宗。	001	The main purport of this sutra is the latter two.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a01_15']	所以然者，文字但是能詮教故，後二是其所詮旨故。	所以然者，文字但是能詮教故，後二是其所詮旨故。	001	The reason for this is that written words are merely the teaching that can be expounded, while the latter two are the intended meaning that is expounded.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a02_8']	今欲顯是宗義，略作三門：	今欲顯是宗義，略作三門：	001	Now, in order to clarify the meaning of this school, I will briefly create three approaches:
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a03_6']	一明實相、二明觀照、三者合明二種般若。	一明實相、二明觀照、三者合明二種般若。	001	First, clarifying the characteristics of the prajñā of the ultimate reality; second, clarifying the prajñā of contemplation; third, jointly clarifying the two kinds of prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a04_6']	初、明實相般若相者，諸法實相，說者不同。	初、明實相般若相者，諸法實相，說者不同。	001	First, clarifying the characteristics of the prajñā of the ultimate reality means that the ultimate reality of all dharmas is explained differently by various people.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a04_9']	有義：	有義：	001	There is an interpretation:
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a06_2']	依他起自性上遍計所執自性永無，所顯真如是為實相，依他起性實不空故。	依他起自性上遍計所執自性永無，所顯真如是為實相，依他起性實不空故。	001	The ultimate reality of all dharmas is the true suchness that is revealed by the complete absence of the nature of imagined grasping onto the nature of dependent arising. This is because the nature of dependent arising is not really empty.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a09_1']	《瑜伽論》云「若諸名言熏習之想所建立識，緣色等相事計為色等性，當知此性非實物有、非勝義有，唯是遍計所執自性，當知假有。	《瑜伽論》云「若諸名言熏習之想所建立識，緣色等相事計為色等性，當知此性非實物有、非勝義有，唯是遍計所執自性，當知假有。	001	The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says: If the consciousness that is established by the thoughts of perfuming from various names and expressions takes the characteristics of form, etc. as its objects and imagines them to be the nature of form, etc., one should know that this nature does not really exist as a substance and does not exist as the ultimate truth. It is only the nature of imagined grasping. One should know that it exists as a provisional designation.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a11_8']	若遣名言熏習之想所建立識，如其色等相事緣離言說性，當知此性是實物有、是勝義有」乃至廣說故。	若遣名言熏習之想所建立識，如其色等相事緣離言說性，當知此性是實物有、是勝義有」乃至廣說故。	001	If the consciousness established by the perfuming of names and expressions is like the characteristics and things of form, etc., which are apart from the nature of verbal expression, one should know that this nature is truly existent and ultimately existent. And so on, it is explained in detail.

['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a15_2']	如下文言「色無所有不可得，受想行識無所有不可得，乃至如法性實際無所有不可得」，又言「諸法實相云何有？	如下文言「色無所有不可得，受想行識無所有不可得，乃至如法性實際無所有不可得」，又言「諸法實相云何有？	001	As the following text says: Form is non-existent and cannot be obtained, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are non-existent and cannot be obtained, up to the true nature of dharmas and the ultimate reality are non-existent and cannot be obtained. It also says: How can the true aspect of all dharmas exist?

['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a16_12', 'ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a17_11']	或有說者：🔽依他起性亦有亦空，世俗故有、勝義故空。	或有說者： 依他起性亦有亦空，世俗故有、勝義故空。	001	Or there are some who say:🔽The dependent nature is both existent and empty. It exists conventionally and is empty ultimately.

The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says, Because there is no truth higher than the ultimate truth.

['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a24_8']	如下文云「有所得、無所得平等，是名無所得」，論云「若顛倒少許有實者，第一義諦亦應有實故」。	如下文云「有所得、無所得平等，是名無所得」，論云「若顛倒少許有實者，第一義諦亦應有實故」。	001	As the text below says, Equality in attainment and non-attainment is called non-attainment. The treatise says, If there were even a little bit of reality in delusion, the ultimate truth would also have to be real.

['ZH_T33_1697_001:0069a28_16']	如《釋論》云「一切實，一切非實，及一切實亦非實，一切非實非不實，是名諸法之實相」。	如《釋論》云「一切實，一切非實，及一切實亦非實，一切非實非不實，是名諸法之實相」。	001	As the Treatise on the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra says: All is real, all is not real, all is both real and not real, all is neither real nor not real - this is called the true nature of all dharmas.

['ZH_T33_1697_001:0071a25_1']	所以然者，佛知三世長遠之劫，即是極促一念之頃，而不令劫促亦不令念長，是故當知彼聲至今，無重生逆理過失。	所以然者，佛知三世長遠之劫，即是極促一念之頃，而不令劫促亦不令念長，是故當知彼聲至今，無重生逆理過失。	001	The reason for this is that the Buddha knows that the long eons of the three times are precisely the extremely brief instant of thought, without causing the eon to be brief or the thought to be long. Therefore, one should know that the sound reaches the present without the fault of rebirth or going against principle.
['ZH_T33_1697_001:0071a26_9']	如彼經言「無量無數劫，即是一念頃，亦不令劫短，究竟剎那法。	如彼經言「無量無數劫，即是一念頃，亦不令劫短，究竟剎那法。	001	As that sutra says, Immeasurable and innumerable kalpas are just a single thought-moment, and do not make the kalpas short, ultimately the dharmas of a moment.
