They are contrary to the ālaya and are not included in the ālaya, because they are the nature of the outflow of the most pure Dharma realm that transcends the world.

['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406a29_18']	一約二智、二約事理、三約自他。	一約二智、二約事理、三約自他。	052	First, in terms of the two wisdoms; second, in terms of phenomena and principles; third, in terms of self and others.

['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b04_3']	然事理相望互為自他，泯如不自化，存如他為化。	然事理相望互為自他，泯如不自化，存如他為化。	052	However, when principle and phenomena are compared, they are mutually self and other. When they are merged, it is like the self not transforming. When they are present, it is like the other being transformed.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b05_10']	言非即離者，自他既別，如事理非即，他化自受如二非離。	言非即離者，自他既別，如事理非即，他化自受如二非離。	052	As for saying they are neither identical nor different, since self and other are distinct, it is like phenomena and principle not being identical. The other's transformation is received by the self, so the two are not different.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b05_17']	然其通有四句：	然其通有四句：	052	However, there are generally four statements:
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b06_10']	一存理泯事，猶根本證如；	一存理泯事，猶根本證如；	052	1. Preserving principle and merging phenomena, like the fundamental realization of suchness;

['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b09_16']	既事理互為自他，則亦應言他人無心我為彼化，而自望他，是他之化故但云他化。	既事理互為自他，則亦應言他人無心我為彼化，而自望他，是他之化故但云他化。	052	Since phenomena and principle mutually become self and other, it should also be said that the other has no mind and I transform for them. But from the perspective of oneself towards others, it is the other's transformation, so it is only said to be the other's transformation.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b10_10']	又應唯就證如之上亦有自他。	又應唯就證如之上亦有自他。	052	Moreover, it should only be based on the realization of suchness, which also has self and other.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b12_1']	一於境無心唯能證智，如他無心我為他化，即存自泯他。	一於境無心唯能證智，如他無心我為他化，即存自泯他。	052	1. Within the object, having no mind is only the wisdom of realization, like the other having no mind and I transforming for the other. This preserves the self and merges the other.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b13_7']	二絕能證智唯有如故，如自無心他為我化，即存他泯自。	二絕能證智唯有如故，如自無心他為我化，即存他泯自。	052	Second, the wisdom that can be realized is only thusness, because thusness itself has no mind, and others transform for me, so it is the existence of others and the obliteration of self.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b14_10']	三不壞能所，俱無執故，故云都無所得，即俱存義。	三不壞能所，俱無執故，故云都無所得，即俱存義。	052	Third, the ability and objects are indestructible, because there is no attachment, so it is said that there is nothing to attain, which is the meaning of both existing.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b15_3']	四取都無所得，即俱泯義。	四取都無所得，即俱泯義。	052	Fourth, the attainment of nothing to attain is the meaning of both being obliterated.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b16_7']	疏「因他受用而有所作非自事故」者，三約自他釋。	疏「因他受用而有所作非自事故」者，三約自他釋。	052	The commentary states, Because it is created by others' enjoyment, it is not one's own affair. Third, it is explained in terms of self and others.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b16_13']	然曲有二義：	然曲有二義：	052	However, there are two meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b17_8']	一自他隱顯義、二自他相作義。	一自他隱顯義、二自他相作義。	052	First, the meaning of the concealment and manifestation of self and others; second, the meaning of the mutual creation of self and others.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b18_1']	前中，語則是一，義乃有二：	前中，語則是一，義乃有二：	052	In the first, the words are the same, but the meanings are twofold:
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b19_7']	一約見他受用身土名而有所作，非自受用之自事故。	一約見他受用身土名而有所作，非自受用之自事故。	052	First, in terms of seeing the enjoyment body and land of others, it is said to be created, because it is not one's own affair of self-enjoyment.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b20_10']	二者大悲為首一向利他，非由自已而有其事。	二者大悲為首一向利他，非由自已而有其事。	052	Second, great compassion is foremost, and it benefits others in one way, because it is not one's own affair.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b21_12']	二「自他」下，明自他相作義，如第八地十身相作。	二「自他」下，明自他相作義，如第八地十身相作。	052	Second, below self and others, it clarifies the meaning of the mutual creation of self and others, such as the mutual creation of the ten bodies in the eighth ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b24_11']	經云「此菩薩能隨眾生心之所樂，能以自身作國土身、眾生身、業報身、聲聞身、緣覺身、菩薩身、如來身、法身、智身、虛空身。	經云「此菩薩能隨眾生心之所樂，能以自身作國土身、眾生身、業報身、聲聞身、緣覺身、菩薩身、如來身、法身、智身、虛空身。	052	The sutra says, This bodhisattva can, in accordance with the mental inclinations of sentient beings, transform his own body into the body of a country, the body of a sentient being, the body of karmic retribution, the body of a śrāvaka, the body of a pratyekabuddha, the body of a bodhisattva, the body of a tathāgata, the body of the Dharma, the body of wisdom, and the body of space.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b24_19']	」此即自作他也。	」此即自作他也。	052	This is the transformation of self into other.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b25_15']	「又隨眾生心之所樂，能以眾生身作自身。	「又隨眾生心之所樂，能以眾生身作自身。	052	Moreover, in accordance with the mental inclinations of sentient beings, he can transform the body of a sentient being into his own body.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b26_3']	」即他作自也。	」即他作自也。	052	This is the transformation of other into self.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b27_16']	若令眾生身作國土身、菩提身等，亦有以他作他，今但取自他相作之義。	若令眾生身作國土身、菩提身等，亦有以他作他，今但取自他相作之義。	052	If one causes the body of a sentient being to transform into the body of a country, the body of enlightenment, and so forth, there is also the transformation of other into other. Now, we only take the meaning of the mutual transformation of self and other.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b29_2']	然自作他如自身，無作他作自，如令他化作樂具。	然自作他如自身，無作他作自，如令他化作樂具。	052	However, the transformation of self into other is like one's own body, without the transformation of other into self, like causing others to create enjoyable objects.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406b29_15']	又自作他，如為他化作樂具。	又自作他，如為他化作樂具。	052	Moreover, the transformation of self into other is like creating enjoyable objects for others.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c01_8']	他作自，如他為己化作樂具。	他作自，如他為己化作樂具。	052	The transformation of other into self is like others creating enjoyable objects for oneself.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c02_2']	故云「自他相作皆自在故」。	故云「自他相作皆自在故」。	052	Therefore, it is said, Because the mutual transformation of self and other is all freely done.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c02_19']	疏「將證離欲」下，二通釋第六天義。	疏「將證離欲」下，二通釋第六天義。	052	The commentary below about to realize separation from desire is the second general explanation of the meaning of the sixth heaven.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c03_9']	以是欲界之頂，隣梵天故。	以是欲界之頂，隣梵天故。	052	Because it is the peak of the desire realm, neighboring the Brahma Heaven.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c04_3']	色界梵天即是離欲，如於佛位。	色界梵天即是離欲，如於佛位。	052	The form realm Brahma Heaven is precisely separation from desire, like in the Buddha stage.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c05_4']	今明十地，如在第六希欲，將昇隣極證故。	今明十地，如在第六希欲，將昇隣極證故。	052	Now, clarifying the ten grounds is like being in the sixth, about to ascend and neighbor the ultimate realization.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c05_17']	疏「三約法」下，就法釋名。	疏「三約法」下，就法釋名。	052	The commentary below third, in terms of the Dharma explains the name based on the Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c05_20']	分二：	分二：	052	It is divided into two parts:

['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c07_7']	先解本名、後釋別目。	先解本名、後釋別目。	052	First, explaining the original name; second, explaining the specific names.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c07_18']	今初，《本業》有三義：	今初，《本業》有三義：	052	Now, the first, the Benye Sutra has three meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c08_4']	一持、二生、三成。	一持、二生、三成。	052	First, upholding; second, giving birth; third, accomplishing.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c08_18']	本論開為四義，住、持為二故。	本論開為四義，住、持為二故。	052	The original treatise opens it up into four meanings, because upholding and supporting are two.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c09_9']	一生者出生，謂出因生果。	一生者出生，謂出因生果。	052	First, giving birth means giving birth to what is produced, referring to giving birth to the effect from the cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c10_1']	二成者成就，亦通因果。	二成者成就，亦通因果。	052	Second, accomplishing means achieving, which is also common to both cause and effect.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c10_17']	又以因望果，始起名生，終滿名成。	又以因望果，始起名生，終滿名成。	052	Moreover, in terms of cause and effect, the initial arising is called giving birth, and the final fulfillment is called accomplishing.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c11_9']	又為因名生，為緣名住故。	又為因名生，為緣名住故。	052	Also, it is called birth because it is a cause, and it is called abiding because it is a condition.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c12_1']	第三名住，住亦住處。	第三名住，住亦住處。	052	The third is called abiding, and abiding is also a place of abiding.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c13_2']	故龍樹《十住毘婆沙》云「十皆住處，名之為地。	故龍樹《十住毘婆沙》云「十皆住處，名之為地。	052	Therefore Nāgârjuna's Daśabhūmika-vibhāṣā says: The ten are all places of abiding, and are called grounds.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c14_16']	」又因滿分相應不退，名之為住，住即不動義，故初地云「以不動相應故」。	」又因滿分相應不退，名之為住，住即不動義，故初地云「以不動相應故」。	052	Moreover, it is called abiding because it is filled, divided, associated, and non-retrogressive. Abiding is the meaning of immovability, so the first ground says: Because it is associated with immovability.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c16_12']	四持者，通望因果，如彼初地能持自他一切功德，復持二地乃至佛果所有功德。	四持者，通望因果，如彼初地能持自他一切功德，復持二地乃至佛果所有功德。	052	As for the four supports, they are generally based on causes and effects, like how the first ground is able to support all merits of self and others, and further supports the merits of the second ground up to the fruition of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c17_3']	若無初地，餘不成故。	若無初地，餘不成故。	052	If there is no first ground, the rest cannot be accomplished.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c18_3']	若合住持，但是三義，則同《本業》為功德依。	若合住持，但是三義，則同《本業》為功德依。	052	If abiding and supporting are combined, they are just three meanings, which are the same as the Benye jing being the basis for merits.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c18_13']	地能持故，能持為持。	地能持故，能持為持。	052	Because the ground is able to support, being able to support is supporting.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c19_3']	所持為住，住亦依義。	所持為住，住亦依義。	052	What is supported is abiding, and abiding also has the meaning of relying.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0406c20_13']	然若望離佛智外無可修行，由行佛智而成十地，則佛智為能持。	然若望離佛智外無可修行，由行佛智而成十地，則佛智為能持。	052	However, if we look at it from the perspective that apart from the Buddha's wisdom there is nothing to be practiced, and that by practicing the Buddha's wisdom one attains the ten grounds, then the Buddha's wisdom is the supporter.

['ZH_T36_1736_052:0407c05_1']	言所顯者，一切地中果分行德，捨修契實離相離言，但可寄彼因分修相顯標真德，故說斯德以為所顯。	言所顯者，一切地中果分行德，捨修契實離相離言，但可寄彼因分修相顯標真德，故說斯德以為所顯。	052	As for what is revealed, all the virtues of the fruition stage within the grounds abandon cultivation and accord with reality, leaving behind characteristics and leaving behind words. One can only rely on the characteristics of the causal stage cultivation to reveal and indicate the true virtues, thus these virtues are called what is revealed.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0407c07_2']	言所表者，向雖顯德，意不在事，為欲寄彼諸佛菩薩離相淨證，表彰地法以為所表。	言所表者，向雖顯德，意不在事，為欲寄彼諸佛菩薩離相淨證，表彰地法以為所表。	052	As for what is indicated, although the virtues have been revealed above, the intention is not in the phenomena. In order to rely on the pure realization of the characteristics of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the dharmas of the grounds are used as what is indicated.
['ZH_T36_1736_052:0407c08_1']	良以地法眾生自實，情倒謬解處而不覺。	良以地法眾生自實，情倒謬解處而不覺。	052	It is precisely because the dharmas of the grounds are inherently real for sentient beings, but due to inverted and erroneous understanding, they are unaware of them.

The dharmas of the grounds are precisely the ten suchnesses that are to be realized, and are included in the fruition sea.
