['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906a25_12']	菩薩捨身，是名內施。	菩薩捨身，是名內施。	The bodhisattva abandoning the body is called internal giving.
['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906a26_13']	若菩薩為食吐眾生，食已吐施，是名內外施。	若菩薩為食吐眾生，食已吐施，是名內外施。	If the bodhisattva, for the sake of sentient beings who eat and vomit, eats and then vomits and gives it to them, this is called internal and external giving.
['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906a27_3']	除上所說，是名外施。	除上所說，是名外施。	Excluding what has been mentioned above, this is called external giving.

According to their wishes, they give away their bodies out of the power of others' mastery.
['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906b04_7']	二者隨他所須，頭目手足種種支節血肉筋骨，乃至髓腦隨其所求一切施與。	二者隨他所須，頭目手足種種支節血肉筋骨，乃至髓腦隨其所求一切施與。	Second, according to others' needs, they give away their heads, eyes, hands, feet, various limbs and joints, blood, flesh, sinews, bones, and even marrow and brains, according to their requests.

For the sake of sentient beings, a bodhisattva would rather abandon a hundred thousand lives, but not according to their wishes, causing oppression and harm.

['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906b24_8']	與上相違來求請者，隨其所欲為捨身命，是名菩薩內物應施不應施。	與上相違來求請者，隨其所欲為捨身命，是名菩薩內物應施不應施。	Those who come seeking in the opposite way will have their life given up according to their wishes. This is called the internal things that bodhisattvas should and should not give.
['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906b26_12']	菩薩外不施者，若有眾生求毒火刀酒，為欲自害若欲害他，是則不施；	菩薩外不施者，若有眾生求毒火刀酒，為欲自害若欲害他，是則不施；	As for external things that bodhisattvas do not give, if there are sentient beings who seek poison, fire, knives, or alcohol, wishing to harm themselves or others, then they do not give them;

['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906c01_10']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906c02_18']	若施與者，於菩薩所雖少歡喜，而多起惡行，身壞命終墮於惡道。	若施與者，於菩薩所雖少歡喜，而多起惡行，身壞命終墮於惡道。	If one gives them, although there is a little joy for the bodhisattva, it causes much unwholesome conduct, and upon the dissolution of the body and the end of life, one falls into a bad realm.
['ZH_T30_1581_004:0906c04_12']	若戲樂具，不墮惡趣不起善根，而令眾生因此成熟，為攝取故是則施與。	若戲樂具，不墮惡趣不起善根，而令眾生因此成熟，為攝取故是則施與。	If playthings and amusements do not cause one to fall into bad realms or give rise to wholesome roots, but cause sentient beings to become mature because of this, in order to gather them in, one then gives them.
