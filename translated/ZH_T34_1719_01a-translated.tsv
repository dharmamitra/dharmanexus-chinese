['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a10_13']	此亦不論色行等體，今但以句而分其文，故云文句。	此亦不論色行等體，今但以句而分其文，故云文句。	01a	This also does not discuss the substance of form, action, etc., but now only uses phrases to divide the text, thus it is called textual interpretation.

Even if they appear in the world, it is still difficult for them to expound this Dharma. Even after immeasurable and countless kalpas, it is still difficult to hear this Dharma. Those who are able to listen to this Dharma are also difficult to find.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a19_19']	章安於經聞法能聽二難之中，義開為四，謂傳譯等，合成六難。	章安於經聞法能聽二難之中，義開為四，謂傳譯等，合成六難。	01a	Zhanran, based on the two difficulties of hearing the Dharma and being able to listen in the sutra, conceptually divides them into four, namely transmission, translation, etc., forming the six difficulties.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a21_7']	然聞法中正在時會，及以阿難義通像末，故藉傳譯則可得聞。	然聞法中正在時會，及以阿難義通像末，故藉傳譯則可得聞。	01a	However, in the section on hearing the Dharma, it is specifically about those present at the time, as well as Ananda, which extends to the end of the semblance dharma period. Therefore, relying on transmission and translation, one can hear it.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a22_18']	佛出已難，出仍不值，故經多劫聞者尚難，況修行開悟、說記流通？	佛出已難，出仍不值，故經多劫聞者尚難，況修行開悟、說記流通？	01a	The appearance of the Buddha is already difficult, and even if he appears, it is still difficult to encounter him. Therefore, even after many kalpas, it is still difficult for those who hear it, let alone those who practice, awaken, receive predictions, and spread it.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a24_3']	於中初二約主約味，三四歎教歎行，五六自幸省己。	於中初二約主約味，三四歎教歎行，五六自幸省己。	01a	Among them, the first two are about the teacher and the flavor, the third and fourth praise the teaching and practice, and the fifth and sixth express gratitude and reflect on oneself.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a24_19']	故初二在佛，三四屬師，五六斥己。	故初二在佛，三四屬師，五六斥己。	01a	Therefore, the first two are about the Buddha, the third and fourth are about the teacher, and the fifth and sixth criticize oneself.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a26_18']	故三雙中，一一皆悉先通次別，且初二中出世猶通，通一代故，次說則別，別在今經；	故三雙中，一一皆悉先通次別，且初二中出世猶通，通一代故，次說則別，別在今經；	01a	Therefore, in the three pairs, each one first generally and then specifically. First, the two in the first pair, transcendent is still general, generally referring to the entire period of the Buddha's teaching, while next is specific, specifically referring to this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a28_2']	次三四中，初傳譯師通一切教，次教詔師別我所承；	次三四中，初傳譯師通一切教，次教詔師別我所承；	01a	Next, in the third and fourth, the first, the translator, is general with regard to all teachings, while the next, the teacher, is specific to what I have received.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151a29_5']	次五六中，聞講仍通與他共故，一遍記別唯屬己故。	次五六中，聞講仍通與他共故，一遍記別唯屬己故。	01a	Next, in the fifth and sixth, hearing the lecture is still general, as it is shared with others, while the next, the one recitation, is specific to oneself.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b01_5']	故三雙中從寬向狹，是故後後狹於前前。	故三雙中從寬向狹，是故後後狹於前前。	01a	Therefore, in the three pairs, from broad to narrow, the later ones are narrower than the earlier ones.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b02_15']	故自佛出來，乃至聞於自悟者說一遍記故，故記佛乘最為甚難。	故自佛出來，乃至聞於自悟者說一遍記故，故記佛乘最為甚難。	01a	Therefore, from the Buddha's appearance in the world, up to hearing the one recitation by the self-enlightened one, it is therefore known that the Buddha Vehicle is the most difficult to understand.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b04_6']	言主、味者，主興不易，復經四味方演此經，故知初二誠為不易。	言主、味者，主興不易，復經四味方演此經，故知初二誠為不易。	01a	As for the host and flavors, it is not easy for the host to appear, and it takes four flavors before this sutra is expounded, therefore it is known that the first two are truly not easy.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b06_2']	言歎教者，傳譯不易，經涉山海，雖至此土，民主道合、國無諸難，方可傳故。	言歎教者，傳譯不易，經涉山海，雖至此土，民主道合、國無諸難，方可傳故。	01a	As for praising the teaching, transmitting and translating is not easy, and the scriptures traverse mountains and seas. Although they have reached this land, the ruler and people's way accords, and the country has no difficulties, they can only be transmitted.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b07_7']	言歎行者，稟承南岳證不由他，宿植所資妙悟斯發。	言歎行者，稟承南岳證不由他，宿植所資妙悟斯發。	01a	As for praising the practice, receiving and following Nanyue's realization is not dependent on others, and the resources of past planting give rise to this wonderful awakening.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b08_3']	言自省者，自幸得聞，謙已輒記。	言自省者，自幸得聞，謙已輒記。	01a	As for self-examination, I am fortunate to have heard it and humbly record it.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b08_11']	故《玄．序》云：	故《玄．序》云：	01a	Therefore, the preface to the Profound says:
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b11_1']	「江陵稟受玄旨，建業方聽經文，補接纔成一遍而已」，況二十七聽、六十九治，始末四十餘年，乃成第七修補復難。	「江陵稟受玄旨，建業方聽經文，補接纔成一遍而已」，況二十七聽、六十九治，始末四十餘年，乃成第七修補復難。	01a	In Jiangling, I received the profound meaning and in Jianye, I just listened to the text of the sutra. I supplemented and connected it to form one recitation. How much more so for the twenty-seven recitations and sixty-nine revisions, starting and ending for more than forty years, which finally formed the seventh revision and repair, which is even more difficult.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b13_1']	於傳譯前加結集難，合為八難，以結集時亦假王臣大眾和合，若魔若外令不得便。	於傳譯前加結集難，合為八難，以結集時亦假王臣大眾和合，若魔若外令不得便。	01a	Before the transmission and translation, the difficulty of the compilation is added, combined into eight difficulties, because at the time of the compilation, the assembly of the great assembly of the king and ministers is also required. If it is a demon or an outsider, it is not allowed to take advantage of it.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b14_1']	添謂添破古師及引經論，謂斥非以顯是；	添謂添破古師及引經論，謂斥非以顯是；	01a	Adding means adding to refute the ancient masters and citing sutras and treatises, which means pointing out the wrong and revealing the right.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b15_1']	削謂削其繁長及成文體，使文約而義豐。	削謂削其繁長及成文體，使文約而義豐。	01a	To cut means to cut out the excessive and verbose parts and the literary style, making the text concise yet rich in meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b15_17']	破古不全我已，加彼異見故但云添；	破古不全我已，加彼異見故但云添；	01a	To refute the ancients does not mean to completely negate them, but to add one's own different views, so it is only called to add;
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b16_15']	削乃唯在於已，初記繁芿故須云削。	削乃唯在於已，初記繁芿故須云削。	01a	To cut is only about one's own initial record of the excessive and verbose parts, so it must be called to cut.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b17_3']	故《玄．序》云：	故《玄．序》云：	01a	Therefore, the preface to the Xuan says:
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b18_7']	「或以經論誠言符此深妙，或標諸師異解驗彼非圓」。	「或以經論誠言符此深妙，或標諸師異解驗彼非圓」。	01a	Either using the sincere words of the sutras and treatises to accord with this profound and wonderful [teaching], or using the different interpretations of various masters to examine that they are not perfect.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b18_24']	「留贈後賢」者，《玄》文〈序〉云：	「留贈後賢」者，《玄》文〈序〉云：	01a	To leave as a gift for later sages - the preface to the Xuan text says:
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b19_9']	「斯文若墜，將來可悲」；	「斯文若墜，將來可悲」；	01a	If this text is lost, it will be lamentable in the future;
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b20_19']	《涅槃》云「若樹若石」，斯經稱「若田若里」，後代行者知甘露門之在茲。	《涅槃》云「若樹若石」，斯經稱「若田若里」，後代行者知甘露門之在茲。	01a	The Nirvana Sutra says like a tree or a rock, and this sutra calls it like a field or a village, later practitioners know that the gate of sweet dew is here.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b23_3']	「共期佛慧」者，自非靈岳親承、道場契悟，搜一代教旨、顯五味宗極，將何以為後賢佛慧之基址耶？	「共期佛慧」者，自非靈岳親承、道場契悟，搜一代教旨、顯五味宗極，將何以為後賢佛慧之基址耶？	01a	To share the aspiration for Buddha's wisdom - unless one personally receives it at the spiritual peak and attains enlightenment at the site of enlightenment, how can one use the purpose of the teachings of the entire lifetime to reveal the ultimate of the five flavors as the foundation for the Buddha's wisdom of later sages?
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b25_18']	故佛慧之言，須開三教果頭之權實，發四味兼帶之大小，則人理教行之有歸，開示悟入之無異，方是今經之佛慧耳。	故佛慧之言，須開三教果頭之權實，發四味兼帶之大小，則人理教行之有歸，開示悟入之無異，方是今經之佛慧耳。	01a	Therefore, the words Buddha's wisdom must reveal the provisional and real of the fruition-head of the three teachings, and bring forth the great and small of the four flavors' mixed and concealed. Only then will there be a return to the person, principle, teaching, and practice, and no difference in the opening, revealing, understanding, and entering. Only then is it the Buddha's wisdom of this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b26_1']	問：	問：	01a	Question:
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b27_1']	諸經中圓，與此何別，而必須云開方是佛慧？	諸經中圓，與此何別，而必須云開方是佛慧？	01a	How is the perfect of various sutras different from this, that it must be said that it is opened and then it is the Buddha's wisdom?
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b27_3']	答：	答：	01a	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b27_13']	圓實不異，但未開顯。	圓實不異，但未開顯。	01a	The perfect truth is no different, but it has not yet been revealed.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b28_11']	初心之人謂圓隔偏，須聞開顯諸法實相。	初心之人謂圓隔偏，須聞開顯諸法實相。	01a	Beginners consider the perfect to be separate from the biased, and must hear the revelation of the true aspect of all dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151b29_11']	若已入實但論增進，權人至此一向須開。	若已入實但論增進，權人至此一向須開。	01a	If one has already entered the truth, then it is only discussed in terms of progress. The provisional person, having reached this point, must be opened in one direction.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c02_6']	「委釋」等者，別解題名方七八卷，以初名中總三法故，三法始末亘一部故。	「委釋」等者，別解題名方七八卷，以初名中總三法故，三法始末亘一部故。	01a	Detailed explanation and so on, separately explaining the title will be seven or eight scrolls, because the initial name generally includes the three dharmas, and the three dharmas begin and end throughout the entire text.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c02_9']	何者？	何者？	01a	What is it?
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c05_17']	一部之中莫過本迹，本地總別超過諸說，迹中三一功高一期，故一中之三永殊前教，即三之一不與他同，即迹而本壽量方譚，即本之迹具在今說。	一部之中莫過本迹，本地總別超過諸說，迹中三一功高一期，故一中之三永殊前教，即三之一不與他同，即迹而本壽量方譚，即本之迹具在今說。	01a	Within a single part, nothing surpasses the original and the trace. The original ground, whether general or specific, surpasses all explanations. The three in the trace have the merit of being lofty for a period of time, therefore the three within the one are forever distinct from previous teachings. The one within the three is not the same as others. Only when the trace is the original is the lifespan discussed. The trace within the original is fully present in the present explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c07_14']	且如迹中體非因果，依之以辨因果，因果取體方有勝用，如是三法並由開顯。	且如迹中體非因果，依之以辨因果，因果取體方有勝用，如是三法並由開顯。	01a	Moreover, in the trace, the essence is not cause and effect, but it is based on this to discern cause and effect. Cause and effect take the essence in order to have superior function. In this way, the three dharmas are all due to revelation.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c08_14']	若不先了能開之妙，將何以明所開之麁？	若不先了能開之妙，將何以明所開之麁？	01a	If one does not first understand the wonderful ability to reveal, how can one clarify the coarseness of what is revealed?
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c09_15']	故對迹辨本理須分判，所以釋題不可率爾。	故對迹辨本理須分判，所以釋題不可率爾。	01a	Therefore, in distinguishing the original from the trace, the principle must be divided and judged. This is why the explanation of the title cannot be done casually.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c11_7']	題下別釋理非容易，以由釋題大義委悉，故至經文但粗分章段。	題下別釋理非容易，以由釋題大義委悉，故至經文但粗分章段。	01a	The separate explanation under the title is not easy. Because the explanation of the title has a detailed and thorough great meaning, therefore, when it comes to the sutra text, it is only roughly divided into sections.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c11_18']	題名「文句」良由於此。	題名「文句」良由於此。	01a	The name textual explanation is precisely because of this.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c15_4']	故但分文句則大理不彰，唯譚玄旨則迷於起盡，若相帶以說則彼此無歸，故使消釋凡至大義，並指《玄》文名體宗用、三一總別、寄行約教。	故但分文句則大理不彰，唯譚玄旨則迷於起盡，若相帶以說則彼此無歸，故使消釋凡至大義，並指《玄》文名體宗用、三一總別、寄行約教。	01a	Therefore, if only the phrases and sentences are divided, the great principle is not revealed. If only the profound meaning is discussed, one is confused about the beginning and end. If they are mutually brought together, there is no return to either. Thus, in the explanations, whenever there is a great meaning, it is all referred to as the names, essence, principle, function, three, one, general, specific, provisional practices, and teachings in the Profound Meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c17_7']	故知全迷《玄》文大旨，而欲以文句消經，固蔽理觀深微而但以事相釋義，言弘斯典者遠矣！	故知全迷《玄》文大旨，而欲以文句消經，固蔽理觀深微而但以事相釋義，言弘斯典者遠矣！	01a	Therefore, it should be known that one is completely confused about the great purport of the Profound Meaning, and yet wants to use the phrases and sentences to explain the sūtra. One firmly obstructs the profound and subtle contemplation of principle and only uses the characteristics of phenomena to explain the meaning. Those who propagate this canon are far from it!
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c18_7']	今問弘經者，為名利壅己、為大悲益他？	今問弘經者，為名利壅己、為大悲益他？	01a	Now I ask those who propagate the sūtra, is it to block one's own benefit for fame and profit, or to benefit others with great compassion?
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c19_12']	自行暗於妙宗，何殊無目而導，彼此俱迷、自他咸沒。	自行暗於妙宗，何殊無目而導，彼此俱迷、自他咸沒。	01a	If one's own practice is obscure about the wonderful principle, how is it different from being without eyes and leading others? Both oneself and others are confused, and both oneself and others are submerged.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c23_1']	又妙法之唱非唯正宗，二十八品俱名妙故，故品品之內咸具體等，句句之下通結妙名，教行人理彼此相攝，使妙旨不失稍似弘通，衣座室誡思之自克。	又妙法之唱非唯正宗，二十八品俱名妙故，故品品之內咸具體等，句句之下通結妙名，教行人理彼此相攝，使妙旨不失稍似弘通，衣座室誡思之自克。	01a	Moreover, the proclamation of the Wonderful Dharma is not only the main body of the teaching, but all twenty-eight chapters are called wonderful, therefore, each chapter contains essence and so forth, and each phrase universally concludes with the name wonderful. The teaching, practice, person, and principle mutually include each other, causing the wonderful purport not to be lost, and slightly resembles the propagation. The admonition of the robe, seat, and room should be contemplated and accomplished by oneself.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c24_2']	然遍列事難不可恒爾，今隨義便廣略適時。	然遍列事難不可恒爾，今隨義便廣略適時。	01a	However, it is difficult to list everything, so it cannot always be done. Now, following the meaning, it is expanded or abbreviated according to the time.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c25_17']	故〈方便〉、〈安樂〉、〈壽量〉、〈普門〉並是本迹之根源，斯經之樞楗，必須委簡，餘則隨宜。	故〈方便〉、〈安樂〉、〈壽量〉、〈普門〉並是本迹之根源，斯經之樞楗，必須委簡，餘則隨宜。	01a	Therefore, Skillful Means, Peace and Bliss, Life Span, and Universal Gate are all the root source of the original and traces, the pivot of this sutra, and must be carefully examined. The rest is done as appropriate.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c26_19']	「序者」下，一部大名已指前釋，一品別號此下略申。	「序者」下，一部大名已指前釋，一品別號此下略申。	01a	The preface and so forth, the great name of the entire sutra has already been pointed out and explained before. The separate title of each chapter will be briefly presented below.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c28_3']	叡公亦有二十八品生起次第，今家隨釋準意可知。	叡公亦有二十八品生起次第，今家隨釋準意可知。	01a	Master Rui also has the sequence of the arising of the twenty-eight chapters. The present explanation follows the meaning and can be understood.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c29_4']	然品品初通有四意，謂釋名、來意、釋妨、釋文。	然品品初通有四意，謂釋名、來意、釋妨、釋文。	01a	However, at the beginning of each chapter, there are generally four meanings, namely, explaining the name, the reason for coming, resolving doubts, and explaining the text.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0151c29_13']	釋名必須因緣等四；	釋名必須因緣等四；	01a	Explaining the name must include the four such as causes and conditions;
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0152a01_2']	來意、釋妨或有或無。	來意、釋妨或有或無。	01a	the reason for coming and resolving doubts may or may not be present.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0152a02_2']	或釋名中即帶來意，有妨須釋何例然耶？	或釋名中即帶來意，有妨須釋何例然耶？	01a	Sometimes the reason for coming is included in the explanation of the name, and if there are doubts, they must be resolved. Why is this the case?
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0152a04_8']	又釋名與義更互有無，故釋名一種，或於義前別釋，或帶名以釋義，縱於義前別釋，還將別以貫義。	又釋名與義更互有無，故釋名一種，或於義前別釋，或帶名以釋義，縱於義前別釋，還將別以貫義。	01a	Moreover, the explanation of the name and the meaning may or may not be mutually present.

Now, I will briefly summarize them into one collection. I will now divide them into three parts: the sutras are one part, the Vinaya is two parts, and the Abhidharma sutras are the third part.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0152c28_7']	契經今當為四段，初名增一，二名中，三名曰長多，《瓔珞》雜經在後為四分，乃以四含名為四段」，故今承此借為分節。	契經今當為四段，初名增一，二名中，三名曰長多，《瓔珞》雜經在後為四分，乃以四含名為四段」，故今承此借為分節。	01a	The sutras will now be divided into four sections. The first is called the Ekottara Āgama, the second is called the Madhyama Āgama, the third is called the Dīrgha Āgama, and the miscellaneous sutras of the Garland Sutra are placed at the end as the fourth part. They are thus named the four Āgamas and are called the four sections. Therefore, I now follow this and borrow it to divide the text.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a01_12']	「律開五部」者，佛滅度後一百年間毱多持法，所化眾生不相是非，但為一部不毘尼藏，即八十誦。	「律開五部」者，佛滅度後一百年間毱多持法，所化眾生不相是非，但為一部不毘尼藏，即八十誦。	01a	The Vinaya is divided into five parts means that during the one hundred years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, Upagupta upheld the Dharma, and the sentient beings he transformed did not argue with each other, but formed into one part, the Vinaya Piṭaka, which is the recitation in eighty sections.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a03_15']	一百年後毱多有五弟子，各執一見不能均融齊一，遂分一藏以為五異，如析金杖不失金用。	一百年後毱多有五弟子，各執一見不能均融齊一，遂分一藏以為五異，如析金杖不失金用。	01a	One hundred years later, Upagupta had five disciples who each held a single view and were unable to harmonize and unify them, so they divided the one canon into five differences, like splitting a gold staff without losing the use of gold.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a05_8']	今分文亦爾，雖分為多段，知大旨本一，以所分對本，故云及也。	今分文亦爾，雖分為多段，知大旨本一，以所分對本，故云及也。	01a	Now the division of the text is also like this. Although it is divided into many sections, it is known that the main purport is originally one. Since what is divided is compared to the original, it is called and.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a06_22']	「阿毘曇開六足」者，文中自引《阿含》六度，非《六足論》，如《增一》云：	「阿毘曇開六足」者，文中自引《阿含》六度，非《六足論》，如《增一》云：	01a	As for the Abhidharma that opens the six feet, the text itself cites the six perfections of the sutras, not the Shastra on the Six Feet, as the Anguttara says:
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a10_6']	「菩薩發起大乘法，如來說此種種法，人尊說六度無極，布施、持戒、忍、精進、禪、智慧力如月初，逮度無極覩諸法」，佛說種種不出此六，亦似分章意也。	「菩薩發起大乘法，如來說此種種法，人尊說六度無極，布施、持戒、忍、精進、禪、智慧力如月初，逮度無極覩諸法」，佛說種種不出此六，亦似分章意也。	01a	The bodhisattva gives rise to the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, the Tathagata speaks of these various Dharmas, the Honored One among men speaks of the six perfections, giving, upholding precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom, like the beginning of the moon, attaining the perfection of crossing over and seeing all dharmas. The Buddha speaks of various things that do not go beyond these six, which also resembles the meaning of dividing chapters.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a10_18']	若《六足論》，全非今意。	若《六足論》，全非今意。	01a	If it is the Shastra on the Six Feet, it is completely not the meaning of now.

['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a14_7']	唐三藏將來未譯，此三論佛在世造。	唐三藏將來未譯，此三論佛在世造。	01a	The Tang Tripiṭaka Master brought them but did not translate them. These three treatises were composed while the Buddha was in the world.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a15_10']	四、《識身足》，有七千偈，提婆設摩造，即佛滅後百年。	四、《識身足》，有七千偈，提婆設摩造，即佛滅後百年。	01a	Fourth, the Vijñānakāya-pāda has seven thousand verses and was composed by Devaśarman, one hundred years after the Buddha's nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a16_6']	五、《品類足》，佛滅後三百年，世友造。	五、《品類足》，佛滅後三百年，世友造。	01a	Fifth, the Pañcaskandha-pāda, three hundred years after the Buddha's nirvāṇa, was composed by Vasumitra.

['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a20_4']	迦多演尼子造《發智論》，以前六義少如足、《發智》義多如身，則足前而身後分義不便，況此六論並唐三藏將來，隋時未有，不合指之。	迦多演尼子造《發智論》，以前六義少如足、《發智》義多如身，則足前而身後分義不便，況此六論並唐三藏將來，隋時未有，不合指之。	01a	Kātyāyanīputra composed the Jñānaprasthāna-śāstra, and the previous six meanings are few like feet, and the meanings of the Jñānaprasthāna are many like a body. Then, placing the feet before and the body after is inconvenient for dividing the meanings. Moreover, these six treatises were all brought by the Tang Tripiṭaka Master. They did not exist during the Sui Dynasty, so it is inappropriate to refer to them.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a20_14']	況無分節之相中破云：	況無分節之相中破云：	01a	Moreover, in the middle of the section without divisions, it is said:

['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a22_8']	未必全然以身攝足耳。	未必全然以身攝足耳。	01a	It is not necessarily the case that the body completely includes the feet.

It is said that the faculties, natures, etc. are listed in the chapters. The chapters are called dharmas in the west.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153a26_9']	以分一部為八聚故，謂業、使、智、定、根、大、見、雜。	以分一部為八聚故，謂業、使、智、定、根、大、見、雜。	01a	Because it divides the entire text into eight collections, namely, karma, afflictions, knowledge, concentration, faculties, elements, views, and miscellaneous.

Those with sharp faculties studied the entire Tripiṭaka. Desiring to understand the Buddha's sūtras, they composed the eight divisions. Later, the disciples for the sake of people in later generations, unable to fully understand, made the Abhidharma in brief. The original composer was Kātyāyanīputra.

First, the supreme among all Dharma gates, such as this. Examining this, we know that the treatise master completely accepts the entire text as supreme among Dharma gates, and only then points to such as this as supreme among all Dharma gates. All Dharma gates refer to the teachings of the entire lifetime. If it were not so, how could we interpret the word all?

I have studied them for many years, but I only see that the phrases are numerous and the chapters are repeated. When seeking their meaning, I have not yet understood the purport.

It means that the sections are like dust. It may be a change in wording or borrowing the expression, not completely the same as that text.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0153c14_12']	砂石精者曰砥音止、麁者曰礪，雜塵隨颺同其煙翳。	砂石精者曰砥音止、麁者曰礪，雜塵隨颺同其煙翳。	01a	Fine stones are called whetstones, coarse ones are called grindstones. Mixed dust is blown away along with the smoke and clouds.

This means that Tanluan also did not fully accept the dissection of the sutra text.

The teachings often have a general preface, and the chapter on the origin of the teaching should also be so. However, the teachings are mixed with the separate sutras, therefore they are not the beginning, and the five matters can still be placed.

Therefore, there is only encouragement to uphold and no entrustment.

Both meanings can be considered the middle way. First, there are only four, not more or less.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0154c02_10']	次「因緣」下，明一一不失不差，故一雖處中仍須至四，四攝義足故不須過；	次「因緣」下，明一一不失不差，故一雖處中仍須至四，四攝義足故不須過；	01a	Next, under causes and conditions, it clarifies that each one is neither lost nor mistaken. Therefore, although one is in the middle, it still requires reaching four. The meaning of the four encompassing is complete, so it does not need to exceed;
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0154c03_10']	假使過此攝在四義，故四及一並名處中。	假使過此攝在四義，故四及一並名處中。	01a	Even if it exceeds this, it is included in the four meanings. Therefore, the four and the one are both called the middle way.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0154c05_15']	如十妙等，一一妙中亦具四意，十亦入四猶名處中，今秖須此四，故得名中，故初意云廣則等也。	如十妙等，一一妙中亦具四意，十亦入四猶名處中，今秖須此四，故得名中，故初意云廣則等也。	01a	Like the ten wonders and so forth, each wonder also has the four meanings. The ten also enter the four and are still called the middle way. Now, we only need these four, so it is called the middle. Therefore, the first meaning says that the extensive is equal.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0154c10_10']	若無初意尚不殊外計，況因緣語通通於一化，始自地獄終乎佛界，中間頓漸若教若味，故須知今大事四悉非餘感應，開顯四悉一道無外，久遠四悉諸經所無，觀心四悉一觀遍收，人理等四準說可見。	若無初意尚不殊外計，況因緣語通通於一化，始自地獄終乎佛界，中間頓漸若教若味，故須知今大事四悉非餘感應，開顯四悉一道無外，久遠四悉諸經所無，觀心四悉一觀遍收，人理等四準說可見。	01a	If there is no initial meaning, it is still no different from externalist theories. Moreover, the term causes and conditions is common to the entire teaching, from the hells to the Buddha realm. In between are sudden and gradual teachings and flavors. Therefore, it is necessary to know that the four aspects of the great matter of the present are not the same as those of other teachings. The four aspects revealed through the opening of the four aspects are the one truth that is beyond all else. The four aspects of the distant past are not found in other sutras. The four aspects of contemplating the mind are all included in a single contemplation. The four aspects of the person, principle, etc. can be seen according to the explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0154c11_15']	以此四悉通於始末，約教等三亦須遍述，意則可知。	以此四悉通於始末，約教等三亦須遍述，意則可知。	01a	Using these four aspects to understand the beginning and end, the three such as the provisional teachings, etc. must also be described in detail. The meaning can be understood.

Therefore, the four and eight [teachings] are used to distinguish the opening, abolition, etc. Compared to the past teachings, the present is the true teaching. All the teachings are no longer called differently. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify this in order to show the wonderful scriptures. Without the third meaning, who would know that [the Lotus Sutra] stands out from the rest?
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0154c18_1']	一期教中所譚身土，中間今日無非迹施，指彼大通猶如信宿，先愚密教復迷迹身，至此方袪守株尚昧，無第四意將何以辨能詮教功？	一期教中所譚身土，中間今日無非迹施，指彼大通猶如信宿，先愚密教復迷迹身，至此方袪守株尚昧，無第四意將何以辨能詮教功？	01a	The bodies and lands discussed in the teachings of one period are all provisional manifestations, pointing to the distant past as if it were just last night. Those who were foolish before the secret teachings are still confused about the traces of the body, and only here do they dispel their clinging. Those who are still ignorant of the fourth meaning, with what can they discern the merit of the expounded teachings?

Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra is cited. Although the gates are immeasurable, they are all included in spiritual powers. Spiritual powers are simply another name for response, because they are in response to the responsive.

In the great vehicle, it is shared by those on the grounds and above. Now this is precisely the function of the ultimate fruit.

This means that the middle ground of the teachings is not established.🔽Next, the explanation: now discussing the saha world, which only receives the teaching of sound. Although there are exoteric and esoteric, open and abolished, compared to the other lands, it is also called the middle ground. This means that the middle ground of the stimulus and response of the sound teaching is further clarified.

['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0155c18_13']	故觀心處中，雖則四意展轉相生，以前前為廣、後後為中，但存當分皆名中故。	故觀心處中，雖則四意展轉相生，以前前為廣、後後為中，但存當分皆名中故。	01a	Therefore, in contemplating the mind, although the four meanings arise from each other, the previous ones are considered broad and the latter ones are considered narrow, but only the present division is considered narrow.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0155c20_4']	故此四意從事名殊，應以後後轉入前前，總而論之不逾感應。	故此四意從事名殊，應以後後轉入前前，總而論之不逾感應。	01a	Therefore, these four meanings are named differently according to the matter, and should be turned into the previous ones later on. In general, they do not go beyond stimulus and response.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0155c23_4']	但初名感應者，且捨通從別，以無下三麁妙莫辨，是故四悉淺深未分，故得聲教方辨感應權實不等，會歸圓極教之功也。	但初名感應者，且捨通從別，以無下三麁妙莫辨，是故四悉淺深未分，故得聲教方辨感應權實不等，會歸圓極教之功也。	01a	But the first is called stimulus and response, just abandoning the common and following the specific, because without the following three, the coarse and wonderful cannot be distinguished. Therefore, the shallow and deep of the four aspects are not yet divided, so the sound teaching can distinguish the stimulus and response, the provisional and the real, and the merit of the teaching that returns to the perfect extreme.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0155c26_14']	雖知圓極並在今經，猶覆久成而迷其本，若拂迹應咸由本垂，開迹中感應，即本地感應，本迹秖是一妙高廣，雖知高廣機成由觀，觀成有感真感應也。	雖知圓極並在今經，猶覆久成而迷其本，若拂迹應咸由本垂，開迹中感應，即本地感應，本迹秖是一妙高廣，雖知高廣機成由觀，觀成有感真感應也。	01a	Although it is known that the perfect extreme is both in the present sūtra, it still covers the long-established and confuses its basis. If the traces are brushed away, they all come from the basis and hang down. Opening the stimulus and response in the traces is precisely the stimulus and response in the original ground. The basis and traces are only one wonderful height and breadth. Although it is known that the mechanism of height and breadth is established by contemplation, the establishment of contemplation has a stimulus, which is the true stimulus and response.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0155c28_3']	故知感應通貫下三，況復一一展轉相攝，理雖相攝事必甄分。	故知感應通貫下三，況復一一展轉相攝，理雖相攝事必甄分。	01a	Therefore, we know that the response pervades the lower three [levels of the sutra]. Moreover, each one is mutually inclusive. Although the principle is mutually inclusive, the events must be distinguished.

The name is different but the meaning is the same, so it can be used as evidence. But the name causes and conditions is common and does not limit the able and the unable, so the first [chapter] of the Mohe Zhiguan says:
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0156a04_14']	「或因於聖、緣於凡，或因於凡、緣於聖，縱無強弱亦可互為。	「或因於聖、緣於凡，或因於凡、緣於聖，縱無強弱亦可互為。	01a	Either causes are in the sages and conditions are in the ordinary, or causes are in the ordinary and conditions are in the sages. Even if there is no strength or weakness, they can still mutually be for each other.

From the perspective of the response, then the response is close and the capacity is distant. Therefore, it causes the mutual reception of different names.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0156a08_13']	」但感應之名不可互立，大事因緣雖在迹門，據理應須雙指本迹，但佛出世正為顯實，故且從迹。	」但感應之名不可互立，大事因緣雖在迹門，據理應須雙指本迹，但佛出世正為顯實，故且從迹。	01a	However, the names of stimulus and response cannot be established interchangeably. Although the great matter of the causes and conditions is in the trace teaching, according to the principle, it should point to both the fundamental and the trace. However, the Buddha's appearance in the world is precisely for revealing the truth, so it is provisionally based on the trace.

['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0156a15_7']	次顯是中，既以實相一大對簡小理，其義即足，故不暇開等兼等簡之，既得云大亦應云深。	次顯是中，既以實相一大對簡小理，其義即足，故不暇開等兼等簡之，既得云大亦應云深。	01a	Next, in revealing the , since the one great true aspect is used to distinguish the small principle, the meaning is sufficient, so there is no time to open up the equal and the partial to distinguish it. Since it is said to be great, it should also be said to be profound.
['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0156a17_10']	言「佛指此為事」者，理不名事，但佛欲以此理化人，故名為事，能化所化故云因緣。	言「佛指此為事」者，理不名事，但佛欲以此理化人，故名為事，能化所化故云因緣。	01a	As for saying the Buddha refers to this as an event, principle is not called an event. The Buddha just wants to use this principle to transform people, so it is called an event. Because it can transform and be transformed, it is called causes and conditions.

Both the subtle and the attached are solely for revealing, therefore it is called the fish trap and the rabbit snare.

For example, when explaining the general preface, each sentence must have the four meanings, because it penetrates the main part and the dissemination.

['ZH_T34_1719_01a:0156b29_9']	又序中約教須觀文勢，或須以五時分別，則教在其中；	又序中約教須觀文勢，或須以五時分別，則教在其中；	01a	Moreover, in the preface, the explanation of the teachings must observe the momentum of the text, or it must be distinguished with the five periods, then the teachings are within it;

If there are only the three of planting, etc., then there will be no understanding of where they come from. This is because the three of planting, etc., have different benefits obtained from the three of preface, etc.

If the Buddha is in the world, the specific preface has different benefits in each section. For example, when expounding the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, one secretly obtains the three benefits of planting, etc., which are different. Therefore, seeing the light of concentration, feeling the movement of the robe, being covered by flowers, and even asking questions, there are also the three benefits of planting, etc., which can be known.

The two gates of the fundamental and the traces in this sutra, as well as the bestowal of the teaching, are all different from other sutras. There is a reason for these four sections of text.

Therefore, we know that each stage is layered upon layered, without end, and yet it ultimately takes the Buddha Vehicle's three sections as the basis, and uses the three teachings of humans and gods to assist in revealing it.

Therefore, we know that throughout the future, the three times and nine times of planting, ripening, and liberation are moment by moment the three mysteries, moment by moment the three nines, moment by moment the three sections, moment by moment the inverse and forward sequences, moment by moment the body and land, each different, each entering the truth.

However, the five periods of five hundred years are based on the initial stage, and the benefit of the latter Dharma is not non-existent. It is based on the time when the great teaching can be propagated, so it is called five hundred years.
