['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b15_0', 'ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b16_0']	魏天平二年菩提流支三藏於洛陽譯🔽「須菩提！如來說忍辱波羅蜜」者，此挍量分中	魏天平二年菩提流支三藏於洛陽譯 「須菩提！如來說忍辱波羅蜜」者，此挍量分中	Translated by Tripiṭaka Master Bodhiruci in Luoyang in the 2nd year of Tianping of the Wei Dynasty
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b17_4']	第八經文。	第八經文。	Subhūti! The Tathāgata speaks of the perfection of patience. This is the eighth section of the chapter on comparisons.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b20_15']	此所以來者，前段經明以恒沙身命布施，不如受持此經一四句偈、為人演說，其福不可教，應云彼人取初心中捨身命布施是有漏之因故，所以不及持經之福。	此所以來者，前段經明以恒沙身命布施，不如受持此經一四句偈、為人演說，其福不可教，應云彼人取初心中捨身命布施是有漏之因故，所以不及持經之福。	This is why it comes. The previous section of the sūtra clarifies that giving away one's body and life as numerous as the sands of the Ganges is not as good as upholding a four-line verse of this sūtra and expounding it for others. Its merit cannot be taught. It should be said that the person who takes the initial mind to give away their body and life is a cause of contaminated [karma], and therefore it is not as good as the merit of upholding the sūtra.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b22_15']	論主應如是釋，而所以云「彼捨身命苦身心故」者，為欲生起此經，故作是說，序疑者意。	論主應如是釋，而所以云「彼捨身命苦身心故」者，為欲生起此經，故作是說，序疑者意。	The author of the treatise should explain it like this, but why does he say because giving away one's body and life is painful to body and mind? It is in order to give rise to this sūtra that he says this, introducing the doubts.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b22_20']	云何疑者？	云何疑者？	How does the doubter doubt?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b23_18']	彼人捨恒沙身命，是取相心故，因不清淨。	彼人捨恒沙身命，是取相心故，因不清淨。	That person giving away a body and life as numerous as the sands of the Ganges is a mind grasping at characteristics, and therefore the cause is not pure.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b24_13']	所得果報不出三界，亦不清淨故。	所得果報不出三界，亦不清淨故。	The fruits and rewards obtained do not transcend the three realms, and are also impure.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b26_1']	得福少者，諸菩薩等依此經修行捨身命者，因亦應不清淨。	得福少者，諸菩薩等依此經修行捨身命者，因亦應不清淨。	Those who obtain little merit, the bodhisattvas and others who practice according to this sūtra and give up their bodies and lives, their causes should also be impure.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b27_1']	若因不清淨，所感果報亦不清淨，同於苦果。	若因不清淨，所感果報亦不清淨，同於苦果。	If the causes are impure, the fruits and rewards they evoke will also be impure, the same as painful fruits.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836b28_4']	如似忍辱仙人為歌利王割截身體，爾時身心苦惱。	如似忍辱仙人為歌利王割截身體，爾時身心苦惱。	It is like the ascetic Kṣāntivādin who was cut and dismembered by King Kali. At that time, his body and mind were in pain.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c01_17']	引此為難，故以經答，明前捨恒沙身者，在於地前是凡夫人，未得無我之解，未斷身見等或，故有取相心，無忍波羅蜜。	引此為難，故以經答，明前捨恒沙身者，在於地前是凡夫人，未得無我之解，未斷身見等或，故有取相心，無忍波羅蜜。	Citing this as a difficulty, he therefore answers with the sūtra, clarifying that those who previously gave up bodies as numerous as the sands of the Ganges were in the stage before the grounds, were ordinary people, had not yet attained the understanding of non-self, and had not yet severed the views of the aggregates and so forth, and therefore had a mind of grasping at characteristics, and lacked the perfection of forbearance.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c02_14']	當捨身時，情生苦性，以此捨身難。	當捨身時，情生苦性，以此捨身難。	When they gave up their bodies, their feelings gave rise to the nature of suffering, and this giving up of the body was difficult.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c03_4']	以為法故，雖難能捨。	以為法故，雖難能捨。	In order to take the Dharma as the basis, although it was difficult, they were able to give up.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c04_1']	復謂無為法身，因於人天有為果報。	復謂無為法身，因於人天有為果報。	They also considered that the unconditioned Dharma body was the cause for the conditioned fruits of rewards in the realms of humans and gods.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c04_16']	有此分別故，所得因果俱不清淨。	有此分別故，所得因果俱不清淨。	Because of this discrimination, the obtained causes and effects are both impure.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c06_11']	今明忍辱仙人乃是初地菩薩，解法身是無為，已得無生忍度，成就離取相心。	今明忍辱仙人乃是初地菩薩，解法身是無為，已得無生忍度，成就離取相心。	Now, it is explained that the patient sage is a bodhisattva of the first ground, who understands that the Dharma body is unconditioned, has already attained the forbearance of non-arising, and has accomplished the mind free from grasping at characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c07_7']	捨身命時，心無煩惱，故不以為難。	捨身命時，心無煩惱，故不以為難。	When giving up body and life, the mind is free from afflictions, so it is not considered difficult.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c08_2']	以是義故，因是清淨、果亦清淨。	以是義故，因是清淨、果亦清淨。	For this reason, the cause is pure, and the effect is also pure.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c10_1']	此之二人既凡聖位殊，何得以凡夫捨身有苦，難於聖人依經修行捨身者亦使有苦？	此之二人既凡聖位殊，何得以凡夫捨身有苦，難於聖人依經修行捨身者亦使有苦？	Since these two people are different in terms of ordinary and holy stages, how can one use the suffering of an ordinary person giving up the body to challenge the suffering of a holy person practicing according to the sūtra and also giving up the body?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c10_12']	為除此疑故，故次明也。	為除此疑故，故次明也。	In order to eliminate this doubt, the following is explained.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c13_5']	「如來說忍辱波羅蜜」者，明如來說依經修行，謂菩薩等已證初地，出生忍波羅蜜故，無有取相之心。	「如來說忍辱波羅蜜」者，明如來說依經修行，謂菩薩等已證初地，出生忍波羅蜜故，無有取相之心。	The Tathāgata speaks of the perfection of patience clarifies that the Tathāgata speaks of practicing according to the sūtra, which means that bodhisattvas and others have already realized the first ground and given rise to the perfection of patience, so there is no mind grasping at characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c14_5']	捨身之時無故，言如來說忍辱波羅蜜也。	捨身之時無故，言如來說忍辱波羅蜜也。	When giving up the body, there is no reason, so it is said that the Tathāgata speaks of the perfection of patience.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c16_9']	「即非忍辱波羅蜜」者，明此初地所得忍波羅蜜，非地前凡夫二乘所境界，故言即非忍辱波羅蜜。	「即非忍辱波羅蜜」者，明此初地所得忍波羅蜜，非地前凡夫二乘所境界，故言即非忍辱波羅蜜。	It is not the perfection of patience means that the perfection of patience attained in this first ground is not the realm of ordinary beings and the two vehicles before the grounds, therefore it is said to be not the perfection of patience.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c18_15']	此明地前凡夫未得初地忍波羅蜜真無我解，猶有取相之捨身有苦，不得以此比類引之為難也。	此明地前凡夫未得初地忍波羅蜜真無我解，猶有取相之捨身有苦，不得以此比類引之為難也。	This clarifies that ordinary beings before the grounds have not yet attained the true understanding of no-self in the perfection of patience of the first ground, and still have the suffering of abandoning the body with grasping at characteristics, so this cannot be used as a comparison to draw difficulties.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c19_1']	何以故知？	何以故知？	Why is this known?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c21_3']	「如我往昔為歌利王割截身體，應生瞋恨」，明忍辱仙人得初地無生，會真無我解，離二種煩惱。	「如我往昔為歌利王割截身體，應生瞋恨」，明忍辱仙人得初地無生，會真無我解，離二種煩惱。	As in the past when King Kārṣa cut up my body, I should have given rise to anger and resentment, clarifies that the ascetic of patience attained the patience of no-arising in the first ground, and the understanding of the true principle of no-self, free from the two kinds of afflictions.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c21_8']	何者為二？	何者為二？	What are the two?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c22_2']	一者無始妄想我見俱生煩惱。	一者無始妄想我見俱生煩惱。	First, the innate afflictions of the view of self that has been mistakenly imagined since beginningless time.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c23_11']	既有此我見故，便成就三不善根及三善根性，後時遇緣則起也。	既有此我見故，便成就三不善根及三善根性，後時遇緣則起也。	Since there is this view of self, it then accomplishes the three unwholesome roots and the three wholesome roots by nature, and later when encountering conditions, they arise.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c24_2']	二者瞋恨等墮煩惱也。	二者瞋恨等墮煩惱也。	Second, the afflictions such as anger and resentment.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c24_17']	此言「何以故」，釋上何以得知。	此言「何以故」，釋上何以得知。	This phrase why is it so explains why it is known.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0836c27_6']	我於爾時已證初地忍波羅蜜彼岸功德，非是地前凡夫，故言何以故也，故引如我昔為歌利王以答之。	我於爾時已證初地忍波羅蜜彼岸功德，非是地前凡夫，故言何以故也，故引如我昔為歌利王以答之。	I at that time had already realized the merit of the perfection of patience on the first ground, and was not an ordinary being before the grounds, therefore it says why is it so, thus citing my past as King Kali to answer it.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a01_12']	「歌利王」者，此幡惡王也，明如來因地時曾現作外通仙人，在山學通，為王射獵問鹿因緣，仙人說語答，王不正敬，即為割截身體節節分解。	「歌利王」者，此幡惡王也，明如來因地時曾現作外通仙人，在山學通，為王射獵問鹿因緣，仙人說語答，王不正敬，即為割截身體節節分解。	King Kali refers to this evil king, clarifying that the Tathagata in the past once manifested as an external sage, studying the path in the mountains, being asked by the king hunting deer about the cause and conditions, the sage speaking in reply, the king not properly respecting, immediately having his body cut apart limb by limb.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a03_15']	「不生瞋恨」者，以得初地無生真無我解、一體平等心，不見彼是惡王、我為能忍，故不生瞋恨。	「不生瞋恨」者，以得初地無生真無我解、一體平等心，不見彼是惡王、我為能忍，故不生瞋恨。	Not giving rise to anger or resentment is because having attained the patience of non-arising true non-self and the mind of equality in one essence, not seeing him as an evil king and myself as able to endure, therefore not giving rise to anger or resentment.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a06_3']	以是故知忍波羅蜜唯在初地上法也，不得以地前捨身有苦是其不如，難於忍波羅蜜亦使是劣也。	以是故知忍波羅蜜唯在初地上法也，不得以地前捨身有苦是其不如，難於忍波羅蜜亦使是劣也。	Therefore, we know that the perfection of patience is only a matter of the Dharma above the first ground, and we cannot use the fact that there is suffering in giving up the body before the grounds to say that it is inferior to the perfection of patience.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a07_7']	「我於爾時無我相等」者，明仙人離於我見俱生煩惱也。	「我於爾時無我相等」者，明仙人離於我見俱生煩惱也。	At that time, I had no notion of self, etc. clarifies that the sage was free from the innate afflictions of the view of self.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a08_10']	此我相等四句，釋不異上第六段中，故不更釋也。	此我相等四句，釋不異上第六段中，故不更釋也。	These four sentences on the notion of self, etc. are explained differently from the sixth section above, so they are not explained again.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a11_11']	「無相」者，明此菩薩既證初地真如無我一體心成故，不見彼是惡人能割之者、我為菩薩是受割之人，彼此隹夷氓然平觀，故言無相也。	「無相」者，明此菩薩既證初地真如無我一體心成故，不見彼是惡人能割之者、我為菩薩是受割之人，彼此隹夷氓然平觀，故言無相也。	No notion clarifies that since this bodhisattva has already realized the true suchness of the first ground and perfected the mind of non-self, he does not see the other as an evil person who can cut, nor does he see himself as a bodhisattva who receives the cut. He views them equally, so it is said there is no notion.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a12_13']	得云無相者，何但無有我相，乃至亦無無我相也。	得云無相者，何但無有我相，乃至亦無無我相也。	It can be said there is no notion, not only because there is no notion of self, but also because there is no notion of non-self.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a12_18']	又復解云：	又復解云：	There is another explanation:
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a15_5']	以此菩薩既道證初地，得一體悲心成故，冥然無分別，不見有彼此，我異惡人、惡人異我，故言無相也。	以此菩薩既道證初地，得一體悲心成故，冥然無分別，不見有彼此，我異惡人、惡人異我，故言無相也。	Because this bodhisattva has realized the first ground, and because the mind of compassion that is of one essence has been accomplished, he is in a state of obliviousness without discrimination, not seeing that there is a distinction between self and others, that oneself is different from evil people and evil people are different from oneself, therefore it is said to be signless.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a15_15']	乘此復生疑，難此云：	乘此復生疑，難此云：	Relying on this, he further gives rise to doubts and difficulties, saying:
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a17_2']	菩薩不見能割所割二乘之異名無相者，為有心故言不見？	菩薩不見能割所割二乘之異名無相者，為有心故言不見？	The bodhisattva does not see the distinction between the one who cuts and the one who is cut, and calls it signless. Is it because there is a mind that he says he does not see?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a17_9']	為無心故不見？	為無心故不見？	Or is it because there is no mind that he does not see?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a18_10']	若無心故不見者，菩薩云何而得修行利益眾生？	若無心故不見者，菩薩云何而得修行利益眾生？	If it is because there is no mind that he does not see, how can the bodhisattva practice and benefit sentient beings?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a20_12']	故答「亦非無相」，明此菩薩解彼此無二時，非是念無心，正是初地以上轉勝真解無漏之心。	故答「亦非無相」，明此菩薩解彼此無二時，非是念無心，正是初地以上轉勝真解無漏之心。	Therefore, the answer is not without signs, clarifying that when this bodhisattva understands that self and others are non-dual, it is not a matter of a mind that thinks of non-existence, but rather the mind of pure understanding and no outflows that becomes increasingly superior from the first ground onward.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a22_13']	既此解，雖不見眾生與己身有異，而能以慈悲心廣度眾生，但利眾生不自利益也。	既此解，雖不見眾生與己身有異，而能以慈悲心廣度眾生，但利眾生不自利益也。	Although this understanding does not see sentient beings and one's own body as different, it is able to widely liberate sentient beings with the mind of kindness and compassion, only benefiting sentient beings and not benefiting oneself.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a24_5']	如《十地經》說「一切動心憶想皆悉盡滅者，無有障法想，非無治法想」；	如《十地經》說「一切動心憶想皆悉盡滅者，無有障法想，非無治法想」；	As the Daśabhūmika-sūtra says, For one who has completely extinguished all agitated thoughts and conceptualization, there is no thought of obstructive dharmas, but not the thought of the absence of counteractive dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a24_20']	此亦如是，無有障想，故言無想。	此亦如是，無有障想，故言無想。	This is also like this. Because there is no thought of obstruction, it is said to be without thought.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a25_11']	非無治想，故言亦非無相也。	非無治想，故言亦非無相也。	It is not the thought of the absence of counteractive dharmas, therefore it is also said to be not without characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a26_14']	故不應難言菩薩得一體平等解無心修行度眾生也。	故不應難言菩薩得一體平等解無心修行度眾生也。	Therefore, one should not criticize and say that the bodhisattva attains the understanding of the equality of one essence and has no mind to cultivate and liberate sentient beings.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a27_4']	「何以故？	「何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a28_12']	我於往昔節節支解時，若有我等相，應生瞋恨」者，釋無我人一。	我於往昔節節支解時，若有我等相，應生瞋恨」者，釋無我人一。	When I was dismembered limb by limb in the past, if there were characteristics such as an 'I' and so forth, I should have given rise to anger and resentment. This explains the oneness of the self and person.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837a28_17']	何以得知？	何以得知？	How can one know this?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b01_1']	我於往昔彼歌利生割截身時，離我等根本煩惱也。	我於往昔彼歌利生割截身時，離我等根本煩惱也。	When my body was cut and slashed by that Gāṛa in the past, I was free from the fundamental afflictions such as the view of self and so forth.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b02_4']	即釋云「我於爾時若有我等者，應生瞋恨」故。	即釋云「我於爾時若有我等者，應生瞋恨」故。	It is explained, At that time, if there were an 'I' and so forth, I should have given rise to anger and resentment.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b03_11']	以離我見之惑，得無我解，此以離瞋恨，故證無我見根本或也。	以離我見之惑，得無我解，此以離瞋恨，故證無我見根本或也。	By being free from the delusion of the view of self, one attains the understanding of no-self. This is because one is free from hatred and resentment, and thus realizes the fundamental view of no-self.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b05_1']	「又念過去五百世作忍辱仙人至無壽者相」，何故復引此來也？	「又念過去五百世作忍辱仙人至無壽者相」，何故復引此來也？	Also recollecting past five hundred lives as a kṣānti-rṣi... Why is this brought up again?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b05_11']	欲明忍波羅蜜有二種：	欲明忍波羅蜜有二種：	It is to clarify that the perfection of forbearance has two kinds:
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b07_5']	一者地前、二者地上，非但今者初地中得忍波羅蜜成就，能離二種障煩惱；	一者地前、二者地上，非但今者初地中得忍波羅蜜成就，能離二種障煩惱；	One is before the grounds, and the other is on the grounds. It is not only in the first ground that one attains the perfection of forbearance and is able to eliminate the two kinds of afflictive hindrances;
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b10_18']	於往昔五百世作忍辱仙人，在於地前性地中時，此以得相似忍深伏煩惱，為王割截身體已不生瞋恨，況復今日在初地中得真無我忍行成就，而復生於瞋恨？	於往昔五百世作忍辱仙人，在於地前性地中時，此以得相似忍深伏煩惱，為王割截身體已不生瞋恨，況復今日在初地中得真無我忍行成就，而復生於瞋恨？	In past five hundred lives as a kṣānti-rṣi, while still in the stage of nature before the grounds, one attains a similar forbearance and deeply subdues afflictions. Even when the king cut off one's body, one did not give rise to hatred or resentment, let alone now in the first ground, having attained true forbearing understanding and perfected forbearance practice, and yet still giving rise to hatred and resentment?
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b11_8']	故引此仙人為證也。	故引此仙人為證也。	Therefore, this rṣi is cited as evidence.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b12_6']	「是故須菩提！	「是故須菩提！	For this reason, Subhūti!
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b15_13']	菩薩離一切相發菩提心」，此文所以復來，明「是故」者，以是初地以上得真如實智平等無我之解、忍波羅蜜成就，能忍苦行，於天上菩提不生退轉故。	菩薩離一切相發菩提心」，此文所以復來，明「是故」者，以是初地以上得真如實智平等無我之解、忍波羅蜜成就，能忍苦行，於天上菩提不生退轉故。	The bodhisattva gives rise to the mind of enlightenment by being apart from all characteristics. This passage comes again to clarify therefore. It means that those from the first ground and above attain the wisdom of suchness, the understanding of equality and non-self, and the perfection of forbearance. They are able to endure hardships and do not regress from enlightenment in the heavens.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b19_1']	以是地前未得無生忍波羅蜜成就，見苦行若，於無上菩提喜生退轉故，是故勸勵地前諸小菩薩，應當離一切法中所相之菩發三菩提心也。	以是地前未得無生忍波羅蜜成就，見苦行若，於無上菩提喜生退轉故，是故勸勵地前諸小菩薩，應當離一切法中所相之菩發三菩提心也。	Because those below the grounds have not yet attained the perfection of forbearance of non-arising, they see hardship and may regress from the joy of unsurpassed enlightenment. Therefore, it encourages the lesser bodhisattvas below the grounds to give rise to the mind of enlightenment apart from the characteristics of all dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b20_5']	言發三菩提心者，勸地前人發初地以上三菩提也也。	言發三菩提心者，勸地前人發初地以上三菩提也也。	As for giving rise to the mind of enlightenment, it encourages those below the grounds to give rise to the enlightenment of the first ground and above.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0837b22_9']	「何以故」者，問何以故，勸地前人發初地不取相真無我解三菩提心。	「何以故」者，問何以故，勸地前人發初地不取相真無我解三菩提心。	Why is it so? It asks why it encourages those below the grounds to give rise to the mind of enlightenment of the first ground and above, which is the understanding of true non-self apart from characteristics.

Because the suchness buddha-nature of all sentient beings and the suchness buddha-nature possessed by his own body are equal and non-dual, without distinction, he takes sentient beings as being like his own body.

If all sentient beings are the same as the sages in terms of the principle of suchness, why is it that all sentient beings who have a mind of attachment are not said to attain purity through suchness, while only the buddhas and bodhisattvas who are free from attachment are said to attain purity through suchness?

This section of the sūtra has two kinds of analogies, which illustrate the two types of people, the wise and the foolish.

['ZH_T25_1512_006:0842c17_1']	以不取相布施之解，對治心住於事取相愚心故，言對治法及對治得滅法如是也。	以不取相布施之解，對治心住於事取相愚心故，言對治法及對治得滅法如是也。	The understanding of giving without grasping at characteristics treats the deluded mind that abides in phenomena and grasps at characteristics, therefore it is said that the treated dharmas and the attainment of extinguished treatment are like this.
['ZH_T25_1512_006:0842c18_5']	「此義云何？	「此義云何？	What does this mean?

['ZH_T25_1512_006:0842c26_4']	「如是次第」者，光明對法及後明對治也。	「如是次第」者，光明對法及後明對治也。	Thus in sequence means the Dharma of light and the subsequent remedy.
