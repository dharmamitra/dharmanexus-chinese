['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828b16_12']	所縛即妄心，謂惑與妄心遞共同事，故云俱生，生即是事。	所縛即妄心，謂惑與妄心遞共同事，故云俱生，生即是事。	043	The object of bondage is the deluded mind. It means that afflictions and the deluded mind mutually engage in activities together, so it is said to arise together. Arising means activities.

The manifest activity is not liberated due to the latent afflictions, because the manifest and the seeds have the same meaning as one affliction.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828b21_12']	然下辨使不必與現行俱，此中現行必由於使。	然下辨使不必與現行俱，此中現行必由於使。	043	However, the explanation below does not necessarily mean that the latent afflictions are concomitant with the manifest activity. In this case, the manifest activity must be due to the latent afflictions.

Views are the pursuit of wrong spiritual practices. Delusion is the pursuit of present rewards in the midst of desire and the practice of evil. Therefore, the treatise says, Beings without precepts, for the sake of a little pleasure in the present, practice many evil deeds, and their delusion is extreme.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828c04_7']	」慢通上三，而多屬見。	」慢通上三，而多屬見。	043	Arrogance is common to the above three, but mostly belongs to views.

['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828c17_7']	二有表示等者，自性差別。	二有表示等者，自性差別。	043	Second, having representation, etc. is the self-nature and distinctions.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828c18_8']	然論經此句云作未作相，此則並以思為自性故。	然論經此句云作未作相，此則並以思為自性故。	043	However, the treatise's version of this phrase says the characteristics of what is done and what is not done. This is because both are essentially volition.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828c18_16']	論云「此有二種：	論云「此有二種：	043	The treatise says, This is of two kinds:

['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828c22_10']	」《成唯識》云「動身之思名為身業，發語之思名為語業。	」《成唯識》云「動身之思名為身業，發語之思名為語業。	043	The Cheng weishi lun says, The volition that moves the body is called bodily action, and the volition that instigates speech is called verbal action.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828c24_6']	」然今既云有表示等，即表無表業各通三業，表則三皆是思，無表則非心非色。	」然今既云有表示等，即表無表業各通三業，表則三皆是思，無表則非心非色。	043	However, since it is now said that there is indication, etc., then indicated and non-indicated actions each pervade the three actions. Indicated actions are all volition, while non-indicated actions are neither mind nor form.

['ZH_T35_1735_043:0828c28_11']	種似能熏，故云不別生果，即不離義。	種似能熏，故云不別生果，即不離義。	043	The seeds resemble the perfumer, and therefore it is said that they do not produce a result separately, which means that they are not separate from the perfumer.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a01_6']	四因自性等者，盡集果差別，謂無始業因以是有為故，自性剎那壞，故云盡。	四因自性等者，盡集果差別，謂無始業因以是有為故，自性剎那壞，故云盡。	043	Fourth, the nature of the cause, etc., refers to the distinction of the cause and effect of the path of practice.

Therefore, it is said that the effect of the path is not lost. This shows that they are not annihilated.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a03_9']	前念雖滅，後念續存，故云次第。	前念雖滅，後念續存，故云次第。	043	Although the previous moment perishes, the subsequent moment continues to exist. Therefore, it is said that they are sequential.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a04_7']	亦是因即頓熏、果則次第，如識等五也。	亦是因即頓熏、果則次第，如識等五也。	043	This also means that the cause perfumes suddenly, while the effect is sequential, like the five dharmas beginning with consciousness.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a05_6']	五有報無者報，論云「已受果未受果差別。	五有報無者報，論云「已受果未受果差別。	043	Fifth, as for having a retribution or not, the treatise says, “The distinction of having already experienced the effect and not yet experiencing the effect.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a06_2']	過去生報業現在已受，名為有報。	過去生報業現在已受，名為有報。	043	Karmic actions that are to be experienced in a future rebirth in the past and present have already been experienced, and are called having a retribution.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a06_17']	後報未受，名為無報，非謂全無。	後報未受，名為無報，非謂全無。	043	Those that are to be experienced in a later rebirth and have not yet been experienced are called having no retribution, but this does not mean that they are completely nonexistent.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a07_17']	」更有一理，謂已悔之業則許無報，有報可知。	」更有一理，謂已悔之業則許無報，有報可知。	043	There is another principle: it is said that karma that has already been repented of has no retribution, and that which has retribution can be known.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a09_17']	六黑黑等眾報者，對差別，謂四業相對成差別故，初二黑白相對、後二漏無漏相對。	六黑黑等眾報者，對差別，謂四業相對成差別故，初二黑白相對、後二漏無漏相對。	043	The sixth, the various retributions of black-black, etc., refers to distinctions, because the four karmas form distinctions when opposed to each other. The first two are distinguished by black and white, and the latter two are distinguished by contaminated and uncontaminated.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a10_14']	言黑黑者，即四中初一因果俱惡故。	言黑黑者，即四中初一因果俱惡故。	043	As for black-black, it is the first of the four, because cause and effect are both evil.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a11_12']	又因果俱與無明相應故，即三塗業。	又因果俱與無明相應故，即三塗業。	043	Moreover, because cause and effect are both associated with ignorance, it is the karma of the three evil destinies.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a12_2']	等者，等於餘三。	等者，等於餘三。	043	Etc. refers to the other three.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a13_10']	謂二名白白業，因果俱善故，俱與智明相應故，即色界善業。	謂二名白白業，因果俱善故，俱與智明相應故，即色界善業。	043	That is, the second is called white-white karma, because cause and effect are both good, and both are associated with wisdom and light, which is the good karma of the form realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a14_15']	三黑白業，即欲界善業因中善惡雜故，受報亦愛非愛雜。	三黑白業，即欲界善業因中善惡雜故，受報亦愛非愛雜。	043	The third is black-white karma, which is the good karma of the desire realm, because good and evil are mixed in the cause, and the retribution also has a mixture of what is loved and what is not loved.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a15_14']	四非黑非白業，謂諸無漏業，無異熟故。	四非黑非白業，謂諸無漏業，無異熟故。	043	The fourth is neither black nor white karma, which refers to all uncontaminated karma, because it has no retribution.

['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a19_3']	若《俱舍》意，其黑白業約相續說，以無一業及一異熟是黑亦白，五相違故。	若《俱舍》意，其黑白業約相續說，以無一業及一異熟是黑亦白，五相違故。	043	If the meaning of the Abhidharma-kośa is that black and white karma is discussed in terms of continuity, because there is no single karma or single retribution that is both black and white, because of the five contradictions.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a20_7']	言相續者，謂或意樂黑方便白，如為誑他行敬事等。	言相續者，謂或意樂黑方便白，如為誑他行敬事等。	043	As for continuity, it means either the intention is black and the means are white, such as performing respectful acts in order to deceive others.
['ZH_T35_1735_043:0829a21_6']	或意樂白方便黑，如愍弟子現麁語等。	或意樂白方便黑，如愍弟子現麁語等。	043	Or the intention is white and the means are black, such as using coarse language to show compassion for disciples.
