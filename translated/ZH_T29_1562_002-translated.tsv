['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335a29_5']	亂心無心等者，等言謂通兩處，即不亂心及有心位。	亂心無心等者，等言謂通兩處，即不亂心及有心位。	Disturbed mind, mindless states, etc. The word etc. refers to both places, namely the undisturbed mind and the state of having mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335a29_20']	不善、無記名亂心，餘心名不亂。	不善、無記名亂心，餘心名不亂。	Unwholesome and indeterminate are called disturbed mind, other minds are called undisturbed.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b01_13']	無想滅定名無心，此能滅心故。	無想滅定名無心，此能滅心故。	The attainment of non-perception and the attainment of cessation are called mindless, because they can extinguish the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b03_2']	雖更有餘無心果位，而無表色非所隨流，故無心言不攝於彼。	雖更有餘無心果位，而無表色非所隨流，故無心言不攝於彼。	Although there are other states without mind, unmanifest form does not flow along with them, therefore the word mindless does not include them.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b04_1']	於三性心及無心位相似相續，故名隨流。	於三性心及無心位相似相續，故名隨流。	It is called flowing along because it continues in similarity in the three natures of mind and in the state without mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b04_12']	淨不淨者，謂善、不善。	淨不淨者，謂善、不善。	Pure and impure means good and bad.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b05_12']	善心等起名淨無表，相似相續說為律儀或非律儀。	善心等起名淨無表，相似相續說為律儀或非律儀。	That which arises simultaneously with a good mind is called pure non-manifest action. Its similar continuity is called restraint or non-restraint.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b07_2']	不善心等起名不淨無表，相似相續說為不律儀或非不律儀。	不善心等起名不淨無表，相似相續說為不律儀或非不律儀。	That which arises simultaneously with a bad mind is called impure non-manifest action. Its similar continuity is called non-restraint or not non-restraint.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b08_5']	若無記心，亦為二種剎那等起，由此即說二等起心。	若無記心，亦為二種剎那等起，由此即說二等起心。	If it is a neutral mind, it also gives rise to both kinds of non-manifest action in a single moment. Therefore, it is said that the mind that gives rise to both is a neutral mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b09_4']	然淨不淨二無表色，其隨轉心或不相似；	然淨不淨二無表色，其隨轉心或不相似；	However, the mind that accompanies pure and impure non-manifest action may not be similar.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b10_3']	若淨無表或全無心，因等起心二各相似。	若淨無表或全無心，因等起心二各相似。	If pure non-manifest action has no mind at all, the mind that gives rise to it is similar in both cases.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b10_16']	已說亂心無心等隨流淨不淨。	已說亂心無心等隨流淨不淨。	It has already been explained that pure and impure [non-manifest action] flows along with a distracted mind or a mindless state.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b12_4']	復說大種所造者，有餘隨流淨不淨得，為簡彼故說造色言。	復說大種所造者，有餘隨流淨不淨得，為簡彼故說造色言。	It is also said to be derived from the great elements. There is another kind of pure and impure [non-manifest action] that flows along. In order to distinguish it, the word form is used.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b12_13']	此中造者即表因義。	此中造者即表因義。	Here, derived means the meaning of cause of manifestation.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b12_18']	云何知然？	云何知然？	How do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b13_3']	如契經說：	如契經說：	As a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b13_8']	色造我見。	色造我見。	Form is the cause of my view.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b13_17']	即是因色起我見義。	即是因色起我見義。	This means that the view of self arises based on form.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b16_4']	復言由此說無表者，由善不善心所等起諸位隨流淨不淨色，雖如表業，而非表示令他了知，故名無表。	復言由此說無表者，由善不善心所等起諸位隨流淨不淨色，雖如表業，而非表示令他了知，故名無表。	It is said that this is called non-indicative because it is the pure or impure form that arises from the power of wholesome or unwholesome minds, etc., and although it is like indicative form, it does not indicate and make others understand, therefore it is called non-indicative.🔽In order to show the reason for establishing this name, it is said that this is called non-indicative because it is the pure or impure form that arises from the power of wholesome or unwholesome minds, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b18_2']	為顯如是立名因緣，故言由此說者顯此是餘師意，經主不許如是種類無表色故。	為顯如是立名因緣，故言由此說者顯此是餘師意，經主不許如是種類無表色故。	The author of the commentary does not accept this kind of non-indicative form, therefore he says by this it is said.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b19_18']	以要言之，依止身語表業差別及善不善心等差別，所生無礙善不善色是名無表。	以要言之，依止身語表業差別及善不善心等差別，所生無礙善不善色是名無表。	To summarize, the wholesome or unwholesome form that arises from the distinctions in the indicative form of body and speech, and from the distinctions in wholesome or unwholesome minds, etc., without obstruction, is called non-indicative.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b21_7']	今謂經主於此頌中不能具說無表色相，以說隨流名無表故。	今謂經主於此頌中不能具說無表色相，以說隨流名無表故。	The author of the commentary is now unable to fully explain the characteristics of non-indicative form in this verse, because he says that it is called non-indicative because it flows along.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b21_12']	彼自釋言：	彼自釋言：	He himself explains:
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b23_13']	相似相續說名隨流，非初剎那可名相續，勿有太過之失，是故決定初念無表不入所說相中。	相似相續說名隨流，非初剎那可名相續，勿有太過之失，是故決定初念無表不入所說相中。	A similar continuity is called following the flow, but the first moment cannot be called a continuity, lest there be the fault of overextension. Therefore, the first moment of non-manifest action definitely does not enter the characteristics that are explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b24_14']	又相續者是假非實，無表非實，失對法宗。	又相續者是假非實，無表非實，失對法宗。	Moreover, continuity is a provisional reality, not a real one. Non-manifest action is not real, and this contradicts the tenets of the Abhidharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b25_12']	又定所發亂無心位不隨流故，應非無表。	又定所發亂無心位不隨流故，應非無表。	Moreover, that which is emitted by concentration is not in a state of distraction and no-thought, and does not follow the flow, so it should not be non-manifest action.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b27_2']	若言不亂有心位中此隨流故無斯過者，淨不淨表業應有無表相。	若言不亂有心位中此隨流故無斯過者，淨不淨表業應有無表相。	If it is said that in a state of non-distraction and thought, it follows the flow, so there is no fault, then pure and impure manifest actions should have the characteristics of non-manifest action.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b28_1']	又謂等言通無心者，此言無用，前已攝故。	又謂等言通無心者，此言無用，前已攝故。	Moreover, if it is said that the word etc. includes no-thought, this word has no use, because it is already included.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335b29_4']	亂心等言已攝一切餘有心位，第二等言復何所攝？	亂心等言已攝一切餘有心位，第二等言復何所攝？	The word etc. in distracted mind, etc. already includes all other states with thought. What does the second etc. include?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c02_2']	經主應思，或謂後等攝不亂心，前無用者，此不應然，無容攝故，何容後等攝不亂心？	經主應思，或謂後等攝不亂心，前無用者，此不應然，無容攝故，何容後等攝不亂心？	The Sutra master should consider this. If it is said that the latter etc. includes non-distracted mind, and the former is useless, this is not so, because it is not possible to include it. How is it possible for the latter etc. to include non-distracted mind?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c03_5']	遮言理於相似處起，乘無起等，理不及餘故非全攝。	遮言理於相似處起，乘無起等，理不及餘故非全攝。	The principle of prohibition arises in similar situations, but the principle of non-arising, etc. does not apply to other cases, so it is not completely included.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c03_14']	或可亂心言成無用。	或可亂心言成無用。	Or else, confused speech becomes useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c05_3']	又應簡言，唯淨無表於無心位隨流非餘，於自釋中亦不簡別。	又應簡言，唯淨無表於無心位隨流非餘，於自釋中亦不簡別。	Moreover, one should distinguish and say that only pure avijñapti flows along in the state of no-mind, not the other. In one's own explanation, one also does not make a distinction.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c06_2']	故於此理經主應思，云何離失說無表相？	故於此理經主應思，云何離失說無表相？	Therefore, the master of the sutra should consider this principle. How does one explain the characteristics of avijñapti without error?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c07_0']	作等餘心等，　　及無心有記，	作等餘心等，　　及無心有記，	Action and so forth, other minds and so forth, and in the state of no-mind, there is indication.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c08_13']	無對所造性，　　是名無表色。	無對所造性，　　是名無表色。	Unimpeded, derivative nature, this is called avijñapti-rūpa.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c09_4']	已說無表。	已說無表。	Avijñapti has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c09_18']	此中所言大種所造，大種云何？	此中所言大種所造，大種云何？	Here, what is called the great elements and the derivative form, what are the great elements?

['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c11_0']	大種謂四界，　　即地水火風，	大種謂四界，　　即地水火風，	The great elements are called the four elements, namely earth, water, fire, and wind.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c12_13']	能成持等業，　　堅濕煖動性。	能成持等業，　　堅濕煖動性。	They can accomplish the functions of supporting and so forth, with the natures of solidity, moisture, heat, and movement.

['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c13_11']	此諸大種何緣名界？	此諸大種何緣名界？	Why are these great elements called elements?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c13_20']	一切色法出生處故。	一切色法出生處故。	Because they are the source of all form dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c15_9']	亦從大種大種出生，諸出生處世間說名界，如金等礦立金等界名。	亦從大種大種出生，諸出生處世間說名界，如金等礦立金等界名。	They also originate from the great elements. The places where they originate are called elements in the world, just as gold and other ores are called gold and other elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c16_9']	或種種苦出生處故說名為界，喻如前說。	或種種苦出生處故說名為界，喻如前說。	Or they are called elements because they are the places where various sufferings originate, as explained before.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c16_12']	有說：	有說：	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c17_16']	能持大種自相及所造色故名為界，如是諸界亦名大種。	能持大種自相及所造色故名為界，如是諸界亦名大種。	They are called elements because they can support the self-characteristics of the great elements and the derivative form. These elements are also called great elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c18_2']	何故言種？	何故言種？	Why are they called elements?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c18_7']	云何名大？	云何名大？	What is meant by great?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c19_9']	種種造色差別生時，彼彼品類差別能起，是故言種。	種種造色差別生時，彼彼品類差別能起，是故言種。	When various derivative forms arise with distinctions, they can give rise to those distinctions of various kinds, and therefore they are called elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c19_12']	有說：	有說：	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c20_12']	有情業增上故，無始生死未嘗非有，是故言種。	有情業增上故，無始生死未嘗非有，是故言種。	Because of the dominant influence of the karma of sentient beings, they have never been nonexistent since beginningless birth and death, and therefore they are called elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c21_11']	或法出現即名為有，生長有性是故言種。	或法出現即名為有，生長有性是故言種。	Or the appearance of dharmas is called existence. They give rise to the nature of existence, and therefore they are called elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c22_10']	即是生長法有性義，或是生長有情身義。	即是生長法有性義，或是生長有情身義。	This means the principle of the arising of the nature of existence of dharmas, or the principle of the arising of the bodies of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c23_13']	或能顯了十種造色是故言種，由此勢力彼顯了故。	或能顯了十種造色是故言種，由此勢力彼顯了故。	Or it is called “great” because it can manifest the ten kinds of created form, because they are manifested by its power.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c24_16']	若爾，便有大過之失，一切因緣於果生位皆有用故。	若爾，便有大過之失，一切因緣於果生位皆有用故。	If this is so, then there is the great fault that all conditions have a function in the generation of results.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c25_7']	無大過失，有大用故。	無大過失，有大用故。	There is no great fault, because there is a great function.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c27_17']	言大用者，謂諸有情根本事中，如是四種有勝作用，依此建立識之與空，乃得說為有情根本，為別所餘故復名大。	言大用者，謂諸有情根本事中，如是四種有勝作用，依此建立識之與空，乃得說為有情根本，為別所餘故復名大。	The great function is that among the fundamental activities of sentient beings, these four have a superior function. On the basis of them, consciousness and space are established and can be said to be the fundamental activities of sentient beings. In order to distinguish them from the rest, they are called great.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c28_16']	又於誑惑愚夫事中此四最勝，故名為大。	又於誑惑愚夫事中此四最勝，故名為大。	Also, among the activities that deceive and delude fools, these four are the most excellent, and therefore they are called great.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0335c29_15']	如矯賊中事業勝者，別餘故名大矯大賊。	如矯賊中事業勝者，別餘故名大矯大賊。	Just as among thieves who deceive, those whose activities are superior are distinguished from the rest and are called great thieves.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a01_14']	如是此四因緣中勝名大別餘，無太過失。	如是此四因緣中勝名大別餘，無太過失。	In the same way, among the four conditions, these are superior and are called great, distinguishing them from the rest, without the fault of too much extension.

['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a02_13']	此四普為一切餘色所依，廣故名大。	此四普為一切餘色所依，廣故名大。	These four are universally the support of all other form, and because they are extensive, they are called great.

['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a03_11']	一切色等聚中具有堅等，故名為大。	一切色等聚中具有堅等，故名為大。	Because solidity, etc., exist in all aggregates of form, etc., they are called great.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a06_12']	風增聚中闕於色等，火增聚中闕於味等，色界諸聚皆無香味，青等聚中闕於黃等，滑等聚中闕於澁等，聲等不定，是故唯此四種名大。	風增聚中闕於色等，火增聚中闕於味等，色界諸聚皆無香味，青等聚中闕於黃等，滑等聚中闕於澁等，聲等不定，是故唯此四種名大。	In the aggregate in which wind predominates, form, etc., are lacking. In the aggregate in which fire predominates, taste, etc., are lacking. In the aggregates of the realm of form, smell and taste are lacking. In the aggregate of blue, yellow, etc., are lacking. In the aggregate of smoothness, etc., roughness, etc., are lacking. Sound, etc., are not fixed. Therefore only these four are called great.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a07_2']	何故虛空不名大種？	何故虛空不名大種？	Why is space not called a great element?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a07_11']	彼大種相不成立故。	彼大種相不成立故。	Because the characteristics of a great element are not established in it.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a08_10']	能損益故立大種名，虛空不然故非大種。	能損益故立大種名，虛空不然故非大種。	Great elements are so called because they are able to injure or benefit. Space is not so, and therefore it is not a great element.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a09_4']	豈不虛空有容受故能損益耶？	豈不虛空有容受故能損益耶？	Isn’t it the case that space is able to injure or benefit because it contains and receives?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a10_7']	虛空實無容受之用，非可聚色隨所住方虛空開避。	虛空實無容受之用，非可聚色隨所住方虛空開避。	In reality, space has no function of containing and receiving. It is not the case that form that can be aggregated opens up and makes way for space in the direction in which it is located.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a10_12']	云何容受？	云何容受？	How does it contain and receive?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a11_2']	然無對故不障彼住。	然無對故不障彼住。	However, because it is unimpeded, it does not obstruct their existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a11_11']	由是虛空無損益用。	由是虛空無損益用。	Therefore space has no function of injuring or benefiting.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a12_1']	若爾，何意作如是說：	若爾，何意作如是說：	If this is so, why is it said,
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a12_10']	能容受故名曰虛空。	能容受故名曰虛空。	“It is called space because it contains and receives”?
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a14_11']	此說意言，有虛空故，令有對色展轉相容，以虛空界與虛空相少分相似，故有此處假號虛空。	此說意言，有虛空故，令有對色展轉相容，以虛空界與虛空相少分相似，故有此處假號虛空。	This explanation of the term means that because there is space, resistant bodies are able to interpenetrate. Space is similar to space in that it is a small part of space. Therefore, this place is provisionally called space.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a15_19']	空界即是咽喉等穴，能令眾生吞咽飲食，及有轉變便利等事。	空界即是咽喉等穴，能令眾生吞咽飲食，及有轉變便利等事。	The space element is the cavity of the throat and so on, which enables sentient beings to swallow food and drink and to defecate and urinate.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a16_17']	以無容受損益功能，是故虛空定非大種。	以無容受損益功能，是故虛空定非大種。	Because it does not have the function of receiving harm or benefit, therefore space definitely is not a primary element.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a17_16']	又諸大種非一非常，自相眾多果別無量；	又諸大種非一非常，自相眾多果別無量；	Moreover, the primary elements are not one and are not permanent. Their self-natures are numerous, and their effects are innumerable.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a19_14']	虛空自性是一是常，相無差別，全無有果，非無別因生有別果，是故虛空不名大種。	虛空自性是一是常，相無差別，全無有果，非無別因生有別果，是故虛空不名大種。	The self-nature of space is one and is permanent. Its characteristics are without distinction. It is completely without effects. It is not that there are no separate causes that produce separate effects. Therefore space is not called a primary element.
['ZH_T29_1562_002:0336a21_11']	若謂餘因有差別故能助虛空生別果者，即此別因能生別果，何用執此虛空為因？	若謂餘因有差別故能助虛空生別果者，即此別因能生別果，何用執此虛空為因？	If you say that because the other causes have distinctions, they are able to assist space in producing separate effects, then these separate causes are able to produce separate effects.

What is not pleasant is suffering, what is not suffering is pleasant, and what is neither suffering nor pleasant is neither. The same is so for the other two feelings.
