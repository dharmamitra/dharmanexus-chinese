['ZH_T34_1718_10a:0135b09_1']	上現滅中有二：	上現滅中有二：	10a	Above, in the present extinction, there are two:

The reason for not appearing to be extinguished is also within the benefits of proclaiming extinction.
['ZH_T34_1718_10a:0135b12_7']	今譬不譬第一，而明現滅之由，正由眾生薄德見佛不修行，即是不肯服藥也。	今譬不譬第一，而明現滅之由，正由眾生薄德見佛不修行，即是不肯服藥也。	10a	Now, the metaphor does not metaphorize the first, but clarifies the reason for the present extinction, which is precisely due to sentient beings of inferior virtue seeing the Buddha and not practicing, which is not willing to take the medicine.
['ZH_T34_1718_10a:0135b13_7']	「我今當設」下，正唱應死，譬非滅唱滅。	「我今當設」下，正唱應死，譬非滅唱滅。	10a	I will now devise below is the correct proclamation of the impending death, a metaphor for the non-extinction that proclaims extinction.

The above text says wishing to be seen and protected from afar in another place, which is the meaning.
['ZH_T34_1718_10a:0135b22_13']	「遣使」者，或取涅槃中大聲普告為使人，或用神通，或用舍利，或用經教等為使人，今用四依菩薩語眾生云佛已滅度，但留此法我今宣弘，汝當受行也。	「遣使」者，或取涅槃中大聲普告為使人，或用神通，或用舍利，或用經教等為使人，今用四依菩薩語眾生云佛已滅度，但留此法我今宣弘，汝當受行也。	10a	Sending a messenger means either taking the great voice that universally announces in nirvana as the messenger, or using spiritual powers, or using relics, or using scriptures and teachings as the messenger. Now using the bodhisattvas who uphold the four teachings to tell sentient beings that the Buddha has already entered extinction, but only left this Dharma. I will now proclaim and spread it, and you should accept and practice it.
['ZH_T34_1718_10a:0135b23_17']	後時眾生若無四依傳述經法，豈能自知佛已滅度？	後時眾生若無四依傳述經法，豈能自知佛已滅度？	10a	If later beings had no one to transmit the scriptures and teachings, how could they know by themselves that the Buddha had already entered extinction?

As the Sutra of the Buddha's Final Nirvana says, For those who have not yet crossed over, they create the causes and conditions for crossing over;
['ZH_T34_1718_10a:0135c03_17']	亦有現得感見，《普賢觀》云「精進苦到得見釋迦分身、多寶、東力、善德等及七佛世尊」。	亦有現得感見，《普賢觀》云「精進苦到得見釋迦分身、多寶、東力、善德等及七佛世尊」。	10a	There are also those who presently attain to see [the Buddha], as the Guan Puxian Jing says, Through diligent practice, one attains to see the manifested bodies of Shakyamuni, Prabhutaratna, Akshobhya, and Suddhaprabha, as well as the seven buddhas of the past.
