Thus, based on the distinctions of the various paths, the sages and ordinary beings are established. In the path that they rely on, it is said like this: right view and right knowledge are called the factors of no-more-learning.

However, they are called seeing because they are by nature discernment.

However, they are called knowledge because they are by nature discernment.

They should not be categorized as knowledge. The same is true of the other paths of liberation, etc., because they are opposed to the uninterrupted paths.

['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735b25_15']	謂不應許唯內門轉方是見性，勿聖慧中外身命住非見性攝。	謂不應許唯內門轉方是見性，勿聖慧中外身命住非見性攝。	073	That is, it should not be admitted that only that which evolves internally is of the nature of views, because then the external body and life in holy wisdom would not be included in the nature of views.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735b29_10']	然契經說於外身循身觀是見性攝，亦非決定如五識身所引意識如是性轉，以彼善等所引意識有時亦是不善等故，由此不應所引意識同能引五識是無分別性。	然契經說於外身循身觀是見性攝，亦非決定如五識身所引意識如是性轉，以彼善等所引意識有時亦是不善等故，由此不應所引意識同能引五識是無分別性。	073	However, a scripture says that the contemplation of the body in the body with regard to the external body is included in the nature of views. Also, it is not certain that the mind associated with the five consciousnesses evolves in the same way as the consciousness that instigates it, because sometimes the mind associated with good, etc., is not good, etc. Consequently, the mind associated with the consciousness that instigates it is not the same in being of the nature of non discrimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735b29_15']	如契經說：	如契經說：	073	As a scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735c01_9']	有命終時得正見俱善心心所。	有命終時得正見俱善心心所。	073	At the moment of death, one obtains a good mind associated with right views.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735c03_7']	故說所有意地善慧皆見性攝，於理為善，如是所說聖有漏慧皆擇法故並慧性攝。	故說所有意地善慧皆見性攝，於理為善，如是所說聖有漏慧皆擇法故並慧性攝。	073	Therefore it is good reasoning to say that all good discernment in the mind is of the nature of seeing. All holy wisdom that is impure is discernment of dharmas and is categorized as discernment.

['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735c12_12']	如是二智相別有三，謂世俗智、法智、類智。	如是二智相別有三，謂世俗智、法智、類智。	073	These two kinds of knowledge are distinguished as three kinds: knowledge of the conventional, knowledge of the Dharma, and knowledge of the species.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735c13_17']	前有漏智總名世俗，瓶衣等物性可毀壞，顯在俗情故名世俗。	前有漏智總名世俗，瓶衣等物性可毀壞，顯在俗情故名世俗。	073	The former impure knowledge is generally called knowledge of the conventional, because such things as vases and clothing are by nature perishable and appear in worldly thoughts, and it is called conventional.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735c15_6']	此智多取世俗境故，多順世間俗事轉故，從多建立世俗智名。	此智多取世俗境故，多順世間俗事轉故，從多建立世俗智名。	073	This knowledge often takes conventional objects, and it often evolves in accordance with worldly affairs. It is established as the name knowledge of the conventional because it is frequent.

['ZH_T29_1562_073:0735c27_18']	此釋不然，說實見故。	此釋不然，說實見故。	073	This interpretation is incorrect, because it is said to be true insight.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a01_8']	謂非比量智可立實見名，諸契經中總說法類，若如實見苦則定見非我，於四聖諦如實見故，能如實見四聖諦故。	謂非比量智可立實見名，諸契經中總說法類，若如實見苦則定見非我，於四聖諦如實見故，能如實見四聖諦故。	073	That is, a knowledge that is not a direct perception cannot be called true seeing. The scriptures in general say that the truths are seen in two ways, as real nature and as species. If one sees suffering as it really is, one definitely sees that it has no self. Because one sees the four noble truths as they really are, one is able to see the four noble truths as they really are.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a01_17']	有如是等無量契經。	有如是等無量契經。	073	There are innumerable scriptures such as this.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a04_5']	又聖位中等決定故，謂見迹者等決定知諸行非常、諸法非我、涅槃寂靜，非真現見可與比知等是決定。	又聖位中等決定故，謂見迹者等決定知諸行非常、諸法非我、涅槃寂靜，非真現見可與比知等是決定。	073	Also, there is equal and certain knowledge in the holy paths. That is, one who has seen the traces of the path definitely and certainly knows that all created dharmas are impermanent, that all dharmas are without self, and that nirvāṇa is quiescent. It is not true that one directly sees and knows that these are certain.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a05_7']	謂以此類彼名為比，知彼非決定，然亦有異故。	謂以此類彼名為比，知彼非決定，然亦有異故。	073	That is, one infers that they are of this class and that they are called certain knowledge, but they are not really certain, because there are differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a06_14']	由此真見與比度知，理不應言等是決定，非諸聖智有比度理。	由此真見與比度知，理不應言等是決定，非諸聖智有比度理。	073	Consequently, true seeing and inferential knowledge are not the same, and it is not correct to say that they are equal and certain. There is no principle of inferential knowledge in the holy wisdoms.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a07_12']	故有智者必不應言有聖諦境比智所證。	故有智者必不應言有聖諦境比智所證。	073	Therefore, a wise person would not say that there is an object of the holy truths that is realized by inferential knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a09_11']	又聖應無緣滅智故，謂若類智比智攝者，則應緣滅法智亦無，以滅總非現見事故。	又聖應無緣滅智故，謂若類智比智攝者，則應緣滅法智亦無，以滅總非現見事故。	073	Also, the holy path would not have knowledge of cessation as an object, because if knowledge of species is inferential knowledge, then knowledge of the law of cessation would not exist, because cessation in general is not a present, seen event.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a10_12']	然許現量總有三種，依根、領納、覺慧別故。	然許現量總有三種，依根、領納、覺慧別故。	073	However, there are three kinds of direct awareness: that which is based on the organs, that which is sensation, and that which is discernment.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a11_8']	依根現量，謂依五根現取色等五外境界。	依根現量，謂依五根現取色等五外境界。	073	Direct awareness based on the organs is the direct apprehension of the five external sense objects, form, etc., by means of the five organs.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a12_7']	領納現量，謂受想等心心所法正現在前。	領納現量，謂受想等心心所法正現在前。	073	Direct awareness as sensation is the present state of the mental activities of feeling, conceptualization, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a13_6']	覺慧現量，謂於諸法隨其所應證自共相。	覺慧現量，謂於諸法隨其所應證自共相。	073	Direct awareness as discernment is the realization of the specific and common characteristics of all dharmas as they are.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a15_4']	此中若就依根領納說類智境非現見事，則滅法智理亦應無，滅非依根領納境故。	此中若就依根領納說類智境非現見事，則滅法智理亦應無，滅非依根領納境故。	073	If we say that the object of knowledge of species is not a present, seen event because it is based on the organs and is sensation, then knowledge of the law of cessation would not exist, because cessation is neither based on the organs nor a sensation.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a16_3']	若就覺慧，則不應言類智所緣是比智境。	若就覺慧，則不應言類智所緣是比智境。	073	If we say that the object of knowledge of species is the object of inferential knowledge, then we should not say that the object of knowledge of species is not a present, seen event.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a17_2']	是故一切如理所引、實義決擇皆現量智。	是故一切如理所引、實義決擇皆現量智。	073	Therefore all knowledge that is attracted by correct principle and that discerns the true meaning is direct awareness.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a18_1']	類智既然，故現量攝，是名二智相別成三。	類智既然，故現量攝，是名二智相別成三。	073	Since the same is true of the knowledge of the class of the path, it is also categorized as direct knowledge. These are the differences in characteristics of the two knowledges that result in three knowledges.
['ZH_T29_1562_073:0736a18_19']	定心相應聖行相轉，有漏無漏二智何別？	定心相應聖行相轉，有漏無漏二智何別？	073	Holy knowledge associated with the mind in samādhi and that which occurs in post-samādhi both have as their mode of activity the contemplation of the characteristics of the four noble truths.

The word all is like saying that all conditioned dharmas are impermanent and suffering, but the noble path is not suffering or impermanent. Therefore the word all only applies to the truth of suffering.

The added practice of cultivating mindfulness of impermanence, etc. is in order to be generally disgusted with and turn away from all impure dharmas.
