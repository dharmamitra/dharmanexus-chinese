['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b08_7']	由彼影像唯是識故；	由彼影像唯是識故；	002	Because those images are only consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b08_19']	我說識所緣，唯識所現故。	我說識所緣，唯識所現故。	002	I say that the objects of consciousness are only what appears as consciousness.

['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b18_11']	由此道理，菩薩於其一切識中，應可比知皆唯有識，無有境界。	由此道理，菩薩於其一切識中，應可比知皆唯有識，無有境界。	002	By this principle, the bodhisattvas should be able to infer that in all consciousnesses there is only consciousness, and there are no objects.
['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b19_15']	又於如是青瘀等中，非憶持識見所緣境，現前住故。	又於如是青瘀等中，非憶持識見所緣境，現前住故。	002	Moreover, in this blue and festering, etc., it is not the memory consciousness that sees the object, because the present object is present.
['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b21_4']	聞思所成二憶持識，亦以過去為所緣故，所現影像得成唯識。	聞思所成二憶持識，亦以過去為所緣故，所現影像得成唯識。	002	The two memory consciousnesses accomplished through hearing and contemplation also take the past as their object, and therefore the reflected image that appears can be established as only consciousness.

Since the various consciousnesses such as the eye are material, how can it be seen that they also exist as consciousness only?
['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b25_15']	此亦如前由教及理。	此亦如前由教及理。	002	This is also like the previous [discussion] in terms of teachings and principles.
['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b27_4']	若此諸識亦體是識，何故乃似色性顯現，一類堅住，相續而轉？	若此諸識亦體是識，何故乃似色性顯現，一類堅住，相續而轉？	002	If these various consciousnesses are also in essence consciousness, why do they appear as the nature of form, persisting in a single class, and evolving in a continuous series?
['ZH_T31_1594_002:0138b27_17']	與顛倒等諸雜染法為依處故；	與顛倒等諸雜染法為依處故；	002	This is because they serve as the basis for various defiled dharmas such as error.
