['ZH_T26_1525_007:0261c04_2']	「持戒布施是散亂心，修道功德決定感於欲界果報，菩薩以迴向方便攝取決定欲界果報，轉求大菩提示現彼果不定、示現善能修習菩薩道故。	「持戒布施是散亂心，修道功德決定感於欲界果報，菩薩以迴向方便攝取決定欲界果報，轉求大菩提示現彼果不定、示現善能修習菩薩道故。	Upholding precepts and giving are distracted thoughts. Cultivating the merits of the Way definitely leads to the fruits of the desire realm. Bodhisattvas, using the skillful means of dedication, include the definite fruits of the desire realm, and seek for the great enlightenment. This shows that those fruits are indefinite and demonstrates their ability to cultivate the bodhisattva path.
['ZH_T26_1525_007:0261c08_7']	又持戒布施是三昧心修道功德，決定感於禪地果報，菩薩以迴向方便攝取決定禪地果報，轉求大菩提，示現彼果不定、示現善能修習菩薩道故，是故如來說迴向方便，復次說成就慈心。	又持戒布施是三昧心修道功德，決定感於禪地果報，菩薩以迴向方便攝取決定禪地果報，轉求大菩提，示現彼果不定、示現善能修習菩薩道故，是故如來說迴向方便，復次說成就慈心。	Moreover, upholding precepts and giving are the merits of cultivating the path with the mind of samādhi, definitely leading to the fruition of dhyāna realms. Bodhisattvas, through the skillful means of dedication, embrace the definite fruition of dhyāna realms, seeking great enlightenment in turn, demonstrating that the fruition is not fixed, and demonstrating their excellent cultivation of the bodhisattva path. Therefore, the Tathāgata speaks of the skillful means of dedication, and furthermore speaks of the accomplishment of loving-kindness.

['ZH_T26_1525_007:0261c13_6']	以諸凡夫不如實知真實法界，無始世來修習無智，以無智故不能遠離我我所法，以其妄執我我所故，為色境界，愛心所纏，是故心常求世間果作極惡行，自然成就世間果報，修行戒施決定成就同界果報。	以諸凡夫不如實知真實法界，無始世來修習無智，以無智故不能遠離我我所法，以其妄執我我所故，為色境界，愛心所纏，是故心常求世間果作極惡行，自然成就世間果報，修行戒施決定成就同界果報。	Because ordinary beings do not truly understand the true dharma realm, they have cultivated ignorance since beginningless time. Due to ignorance, they are unable to distance themselves from the dharmas of self and grasping. Because of their deluded attachment to self and grasping, they are bound by the mind of craving for form objects. Therefore, their minds always seek worldly fruits and create extremely evil actions, naturally accomplishing worldly fruits and retributions. Cultivating precepts and giving, they definitely accomplish fruits of the same realm.
['ZH_T26_1525_007:0261c15_13']	而菩薩心見諸世間所有一切種種過患，見於涅槃安樂利益，善能覺知真實法界，善知因緣有為諸行。	而菩薩心見諸世間所有一切種種過患，見於涅槃安樂利益，善能覺知真實法界，善知因緣有為諸行。	Yet the bodhisattva mind sees all the various faults and problems in the world, sees the peace and benefits of nirvana, is well able to understand the true Dharma realm, and well knows the conditioned activities of causes and conditions.
