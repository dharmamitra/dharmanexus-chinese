['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672a17_3']	無著《金剛般若論》說「阿耨多羅三藐三菩提顯示菩提、及菩提道」。	無著《金剛般若論》說「阿耨多羅三藐三菩提顯示菩提、及菩提道」。	02a	The Asanga's Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra Treatise says, Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi reveals both enlightenment and the path to enlightenment.

['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672a25_10']	三等覺，簡二乘但了生空偏覺故。	三等覺，簡二乘但了生空偏覺故。	02a	Third, equal enlightenment, which distinguishes it from the enlightenment that only realizes the emptiness of beings of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672a26_15']	四又正覺，簡菩薩，菩薩因覺未滿、果位非正覺故。	四又正覺，簡菩薩，菩薩因覺未滿、果位非正覺故。	02a	Fourth, again, correct enlightenment, which distinguishes it from the bodhisattvas, because the bodhisattvas' causal enlightenment is not yet complete, and their fruition stage is not yet correct enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672a29_2']	此顯菩提道即四智品，下一覺字貫通上四，由具下三一切莫過，超遍等喻，真理所覺名無上覺。	此顯菩提道即四智品，下一覺字貫通上四，由具下三一切莫過，超遍等喻，真理所覺名無上覺。	02a	This manifests the four kinds of wisdom of the bodhisattva path. The single word enlightenment above extends to the four below. Due to possessing the three below, surpassing, pervading, and so forth, the truth realized is called supreme enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b01_4']	然諸經論多說真理名無上菩提體，以根本故。	然諸經論多說真理名無上菩提體，以根本故。	02a	However, many sūtras and treatises often speak of the truth of reality as the essence of unsurpassed bodhi, because it is the fundamental [truth].
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b02_11']	今此雙取佛果理、智俱名無上菩提，於此二果俱不退轉。	今此雙取佛果理、智俱名無上菩提，於此二果俱不退轉。	02a	Now, this [text] takes both the principle and wisdom of the Buddha's fruition and calls them unsurpassed bodhi. One is irreversible with regard to both of these fruitions.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b02_17']	云何不退轉？	云何不退轉？	02a	Why is it irreversible?
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b04_11']	由具下十因不退轉，故於佛果能不退轉，決定當證念念進修名不退轉。	由具下十因不退轉，故於佛果能不退轉，決定當證念念進修名不退轉。	02a	Because one is endowed with the following ten causes, one is irreversible and able to be irreversible with regard to the Buddha's fruition, and one definitely realizes [nirvāṇa] and progresses in cultivation moment by moment, called irreversible.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b04_16']	退者失也。	退者失也。	02a	Retreat means to lose.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b05_2']	轉者動也。	轉者動也。	02a	Turn means to move.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b07_6']	八地以上任運進修於大菩提，修習不退無煩惱故，亦復不為一切有相功用所動，名不退轉。	八地以上任運進修於大菩提，修習不退無煩惱故，亦復不為一切有相功用所動，名不退轉。	02a	From the eighth ground onward, one progresses in cultivation spontaneously with regard to great bodhi, and one's cultivation is irreversible because there are no afflictions. One is also not moved by any conceptualized effort, called irreversible.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b08_5']	由此八地名不動地，相用煩惱不能動故。	由此八地名不動地，相用煩惱不能動故。	02a	For this reason, the eighth ground is called the Immovable Ground, because the characteristics, functions, and afflictions are unable to move it.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b08_10']	不退有四：	不退有四：	02a	There are four kinds of irreversibility:
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b09_15']	一信不退，十信第六名不退心，自後不退生邪見故。	一信不退，十信第六名不退心，自後不退生邪見故。	02a	First, irreversibility in faith. The sixth of the ten faiths is called the irreversible mind, because after that one does not regress and give rise to wrong views.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b11_2']	二位不退，十住第七名不退位，自後不退入二乘故。	二位不退，十住第七名不退位，自後不退入二乘故。	02a	The two stages of nonretrogression are the seventh stage of the ten abodes, called the stage of nonretrogression, because after that one does not retrogress into the two vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b12_6']	三證不退，初地以上即名不退，所證得法不退失故。	三證不退，初地以上即名不退，所證得法不退失故。	02a	The three kinds of realization of nonretrogression are those from the first ground on up, which are called nonretrogression, because the Dharma realized and attained is not lost.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b13_12']	四行不退，八地已上名不退地，為、無為法皆能修故。	四行不退，八地已上名不退地，為、無為法皆能修故。	02a	The four kinds of practice of nonretrogression are those from the eighth ground on up, which are called the stage of nonretrogression, because one is able to cultivate both conditioned and unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b15_10']	今此菩薩皆八地已上故，言於無上正等覺不退轉，定當證故，故不退者非即不轉。	今此菩薩皆八地已上故，言於無上正等覺不退轉，定當證故，故不退者非即不轉。	02a	Now, these bodhisattvas are all from the eighth ground on up, therefore it is said that they are irreversible from supreme perfect enlightenment, because they will definitely realize it. Therefore, nonretrogression does not necessarily mean non-turning.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b15_16']	又不退有二：	又不退有二：	02a	Moreover, nonretrogression is of two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b16_9']	一已得不退，初地即得；	一已得不退，初地即得；	02a	The first is the nonretrogression of what has already been attained, which is attained from the first ground.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b17_1']	二未得不退，八地方得。	二未得不退，八地方得。	02a	The second is the nonretrogression of what has not yet been attained, which is attained from the eighth ground.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0672b19_15']	無上正覺是未得法故，八地以上能不退轉，情祈正覺心進不動，法駛流中任運轉故，名不退轉，此不退者即是不轉。	無上正覺是未得法故，八地以上能不退轉，情祈正覺心進不動，法駛流中任運轉故，名不退轉，此不退者即是不轉。	02a	Because supreme perfect enlightenment is a Dharma that has not yet been attained, from the eighth ground on up one is able to be irreversible from it. The mind that aspires for perfect enlightenment and advances without wavering is called irreversible, because it turns spontaneously in the swift current of the Dharma. This nonretrogression is precisely non-turning.

['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678b26_18']	彼時唯教菩薩，未有二乘趣一乘故，說教理所依真如妙理正名「無量義」，傍名「妙法蓮華」，此時化彼二乘趣一乘故，說能依行果正名「妙法蓮華」，如出水故，傍亦得名「無量義」也。	彼時唯教菩薩，未有二乘趣一乘故，說教理所依真如妙理正名「無量義」，傍名「妙法蓮華」，此時化彼二乘趣一乘故，說能依行果正名「妙法蓮華」，如出水故，傍亦得名「無量義」也。	02a	At that time, it only taught bodhisattvas, and there were no two vehicles entering the one vehicle yet, so the teaching and principle that it expounds, the true suchness of reality that it relies on, is correctly called the immeasurable meaning, and it is also called the wonderful Dharma lotus flower by extension. At this time, it transforms the two vehicles to enter the one vehicle, so the practice and fruition that it expounds, which rely on that, are correctly called the wonderful Dharma lotus flower, because it emerges from the water, and it is also called the immeasurable meaning by extension.

['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678c02_15']	四云又彼以教理名為蓮華，菩薩已修一乘之因趣一乘果故，不為說行果一乘名為「法華」，由但不知應病與藥之教理故，但說教理名為「法華」。	四云又彼以教理名為蓮華，菩薩已修一乘之因趣一乘果故，不為說行果一乘名為「法華」，由但不知應病與藥之教理故，但說教理名為「法華」。	02a	Fourth, they say that the teachings and principles are called the lotus flower. Bodhisattvas have already cultivated the causes of the One Vehicle and are heading towards the fruition of the One Vehicle, so it is not taught to them. The One Vehicle of practice and fruition is called the Lotus Sutra. It is only because they do not know the teachings and principles that accord with the illness and prescribe the medicine that it is only said that the teachings and principles are called the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678c04_20']	今此會中二乘未能應病與藥，故不為說教理蓮華，但為彼說行果二種，名為「蓮華」，令趣入故。	今此會中二乘未能應病與藥，故不為說教理蓮華，但為彼說行果二種，名為「蓮華」，令趣入故。	02a	Now in this assembly, the two vehicles are still unable to accord with the illness and prescribe the medicine, so the teachings and principles of the lotus flower are not taught to them. It is only taught to them that the two kinds of practice and fruition are called the lotus flower, in order to cause them to enter.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678c05_19']	故下經云「乘此寶乘直至道場」，因行華也。	故下經云「乘此寶乘直至道場」，因行華也。	02a	Therefore, the sutra below says, Riding this jeweled vehicle straight to the site of enlightenment, which is the lotus flower of the causal practice.

The first three are the fruits, and the last one is the cause.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678c10_5']	《勝鬘》亦爾，唯說一乘因果名一乘故。	《勝鬘》亦爾，唯說一乘因果名一乘故。	02a	The Śrīmālā[sūtra] is also like this, only speaking of the cause and effect of the One Vehicle as the One Vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678c14_9']	前三義釋彼此體同，後二義釋此寬彼狹，由此義故彼《無量義經》唯以二義名為「無量」：	前三義釋彼此體同，後二義釋此寬彼狹，由此義故彼《無量義經》唯以二義名為「無量」：	02a	The first three meanings explain that the essence of this [sūtra] is the same as that [of the Wuliangyi jing], while the last two meanings explain that this [sūtra] is broader than that [sūtra]. For this reason, the Wuliangyi jing only takes two meanings as immeasurable:
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678c14_15']	一法、二義。	一法、二義。	02a	one is the Dharma, and the other is the meaning.

Because the Dharma is immeasurable, the meaning is also immeasurable. The immeasurable meaning arises from a single Dharma, and that single Dharma is the signless.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0678c19_7']	」然今此經雖初讚理教，後文多以行果名為蓮華實體。	」然今此經雖初讚理教，後文多以行果名為蓮華實體。	02a	However, although this sutra praises principle and teaching at the beginning, the later text often uses practice and fruition as the actual body of the lotus flower.

It is not only sitting peacefully that is called dignified deportment.

['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a12_1']	觀無相理定名無量義處三昧，處謂處所，無量義者無量義教所詮眾義，因真理生故說真理名之為處。	觀無相理定名無量義處三昧，處謂處所，無量義者無量義教所詮眾義，因真理生故說真理名之為處。	02a	Contemplating the principle of signlessness is called the samādhi of the abode of immeasurable meanings. Abode means place. Immeasurable meanings refers to the myriad meanings expounded by the teachings of immeasurable meanings. Because they arise from true reality, true reality is called the abode.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a12_13']	論解一依三昧成就有二義：	論解一依三昧成就有二義：	02a	The treatise explains that the accomplishment of samādhi has two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a16_16']	一者成就自在力身心不動故，謂若不入三昧有分別動搖，於此不能證說自在，今入三昧身心不動離於分別動搖，於法便得能證說自在故，云成就自在力，身心不動故。	一者成就自在力身心不動故，謂若不入三昧有分別動搖，於此不能證說自在，今入三昧身心不動離於分別動搖，於法便得能證說自在故，云成就自在力，身心不動故。	02a	First, it accomplishes the power of mastery, with body and mind unmoving. This means that if one does not enter samādhi, there is discrimination and agitation, and one cannot realize and expound mastery in this. Now, entering samādhi, body and mind are unmoving, free from discrimination and agitation, and one attains mastery in the Dharma, therefore it is said to accomplish the power of mastery, with body and mind unmoving.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a19_6']	二者離一切障隨自在力故，謂得入三昧離諸定障，隨順於法證說自在，若有定障於證及說不自在故。	二者離一切障隨自在力故，謂得入三昧離諸定障，隨順於法證說自在，若有定障於證及說不自在故。	02a	Second, it is due to the power of freedom from all hindrances, meaning that upon entering samādhi one is free from all obstacles to concentration, and in accordance with the Dharma one realizes and speaks with mastery. If there are obstacles to concentration, then one is not free in realization and speech.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a20_1']	論次別釋前自在力有二：	論次別釋前自在力有二：	02a	The treatise next specifically explains the above power of mastery, which is twofold:
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a22_10']	一隨順眾生不見對治攝取覺菩提分法故，釋初自在力，謂諸眾生不能任運見無漏對治道，思覺方得；	一隨順眾生不見對治攝取覺菩提分法故，釋初自在力，謂諸眾生不能任運見無漏對治道，思覺方得；	02a	First, it is due to the power of following sentient beings and not seeing the antidotes, and thus taking up the practice of the factors of enlightenment. This explains the first power of mastery, meaning that sentient beings are unable to spontaneously see the uncontaminated path of antidotes, and can only attain it through deliberation.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a24_11']	今佛亦爾，隨順眾生不能任運見對治道，今亦入定思惟攝取，覺察無漏對治道菩提分故。	今佛亦爾，隨順眾生不能任運見對治道，今亦入定思惟攝取，覺察無漏對治道菩提分故。	02a	Now the Buddha is also like this. In accordance with sentient beings who are unable to spontaneously see the path of antidotes, he now also enters concentration and contemplates taking up the practice of the uncontaminated path of antidotes and the factors of enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1723_02a:0679a29_10']	二為對治無始世來堅執煩惱故，釋隨自在力，堅執煩惱謂分別動搖，分別動搖故是非心起，是非心起故愛恚惑生，愛恚惑生故諸業起，諸業起故眾苦轉，今為治此分別動搖法執之心，故入三昧離堅執惑。	二為對治無始世來堅執煩惱故，釋隨自在力，堅執煩惱謂分別動搖，分別動搖故是非心起，是非心起故愛恚惑生，愛恚惑生故諸業起，諸業起故眾苦轉，今為治此分別動搖法執之心，故入三昧離堅執惑。	02a	Second, in order to counteract the afflictions of firm attachment that have existed since beginningless time, it explains that the power of mastery is the afflictions of firm attachment. The afflictions of firm attachment refer to discriminating agitation. Because of discriminating agitation, there is the arising of non-mind. Because of the arising of non-mind, the afflictions of love and hatred arise. Because the afflictions of love and hatred arise, various karmas arise. Because various karmas arise, the mass of suffering turns. Now, in order to counteract this mind of discriminating agitation and grasping at dharmas, one enters samadhi to depart from the afflictions of firm attachment.

One who has not entered samadhi does not perform spiritual transformations, and does not know the past world. This is to demonstrate the characteristics.

Toward true fields of merit, one is utterly free from resentment and hatred toward flattery, deception, and evil conduct, and cultivates difficult loving speech. Wishing to eliminate hindrances and obstructions, one speaks of what should be done first. For those with a well-disciplined mind, one speaks of the true Dharma. For those with much heedlessness, one teaches them to escape. For those with doubts, one discusses the definitive.
