In that treatise, it distinguishes the arising of afflictions due to having conditions for the unconditioned. This quotes the Abhidharma to prove that the ultimate truth also needs to be empty.
['ZH_T38_1779_008:0819b22_12']	如雖平等，復言平等以為有者亦須空故。	如雖平等，復言平等以為有者亦須空故。	It is like although emptiness is equal, it is said that equality is existent, and it also needs to be empty.

If it is said that emptiness is emptiness of nirvana and the middle way, the conclusion and explanation are simply entering emptiness from the provisional.

Therefore, in explaining according to the main principle, it is necessary to distinguish the perfect and the distinct. The names are divided, but the meaning is common.
