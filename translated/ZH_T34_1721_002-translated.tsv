Now, because it will discern the One Vehicle, it first clarifies the root of the vehicle. The root of the vehicle is precisely the true aspect. It is necessary to realize the true aspect in order to give rise to prajñā. Due to prajñā, all practices are accomplished and all afflictions are exhausted. Therefore, one can leave the three realms and reach supreme perfect enlightenment. Only then does the meaning of the vehicle become complete.

['ZH_T34_1721_002:0468c15_8']	一者根緣所宜，謂出入適緣動靜應物。	一者根緣所宜，謂出入適緣動靜應物。	First, it is suitable for the faculties and conditions, referring to adapting to the conditions of coming and going, and responding to things with stillness and movement.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0468c16_18']	二者、為欲現瑞是故入定，則顯定為瑞本，若不入定則瑞無所由。	二者、為欲現瑞是故入定，則顯定為瑞本，若不入定則瑞無所由。	Second, it is in order to manifest auspicious signs, therefore entering concentration, which shows that concentration is the basis of auspicious signs. If one does not enter concentration, then the auspicious signs have no basis.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0468c18_4']	又不入定而現瑞者，或恐非佛現瑞，為是義故須入定也。	又不入定而現瑞者，或恐非佛現瑞，為是義故須入定也。	Moreover, if one manifests auspicious signs without entering concentration, it may be feared that it is not the Buddha manifesting the auspicious signs. For this reason, it is necessary to enter concentration.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0468c19_11']	三者、夫欲赴緣說法，必須審法察機，今將演一乘故入定也。	三者、夫欲赴緣說法，必須審法察機，今將演一乘故入定也。	Third, if one wishes to respond to conditions and expound the Dharma, one must examine the Dharma and discern the capacities of the audience.

The Buddha refutes this attachment, therefore clarifying that all dharmas are accomplished through causes and conditions. Since wisdom arises from concentration, when stillness is extreme, then the mirror is clear.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0468c26_1']	六者、示佛定圓慧滿，入定故顯佛定圓，起定說法彰佛慧滿，若不入定則定門不顯，若不說法則慧義不彰也。	六者、示佛定圓慧滿，入定故顯佛定圓，起定說法彰佛慧滿，若不入定則定門不顯，若不說法則慧義不彰也。	Sixth, it shows the Buddha's perfect samādhi and wisdom. Entering samādhi reveals the Buddha's perfect samādhi, and rising from samādhi to speak the Dharma shows the Buddha's perfect wisdom. If he did not enter samādhi, then the door of samādhi would not be revealed. If he did not speak the Dharma, then the meaning of wisdom would not be shown.

If the Buddha, when about to speak the Dharma, still enters samādhi to still his mind, then how much more so should other people, with scattered minds, wish to speak the Dharma?

Now, entering the samadhi of the realm of immeasurable meanings, one returns to enter the one Dharma. Both entering and exiting are the one path of purity, showing that the Lotus Sutra is also like this, thus it is the preface to the Lotus Sutra.

['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a10_3']	如《大品經》云「諸法無所有，如是有諸法」。	如《大品經》云「諸法無所有，如是有諸法」。	As the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, All dharmas are non-existent, yet in this way all dharmas exist.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a10_17']	無所有者，一切諸法本性寂滅。	無所有者，一切諸法本性寂滅。	As for non-existence, the inherent nature of all dharmas is quiescent extinction.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a12_3']	如是有者，諸法雖無所有，於眾生顛倒成有，故有六趣生死。	如是有者，諸法雖無所有，於眾生顛倒成有，故有六趣生死。	As for existence, although all dharmas are non-existent, they become existent due to the delusion of sentient beings, thus there are the six destinies of birth and death.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a13_14']	既無所有於眾生成有，今欲令其悟有無所有，故第二次明有佛出世。	既無所有於眾生成有，今欲令其悟有無所有，故第二次明有佛出世。	Since non-existence becomes existence for sentient beings, now wishing to cause them to realize the non-existence of existence, therefore the second time clarifies the appearance of a Buddha in the world.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a17_11']	既有化主即說教門，既有所稟之教故便有稟教之人，如稟三乘之教後皆成菩薩，既並成菩薩即一化事竟便般涅槃，為利物故次明起塔，故云七事明一化始終究竟也。	既有化主即說教門，既有所稟之教故便有稟教之人，如稟三乘之教後皆成菩薩，既並成菩薩即一化事竟便般涅槃，為利物故次明起塔，故云七事明一化始終究竟也。	Since there is a transforming master, he then expounds the teachings. Since there is a teaching to be received, there are then people who receive the teaching. As in receiving the teaching of the three vehicles, later all become bodhisattvas. Since they all become bodhisattvas, the single transformative event is complete and then parinirvāṇa. In order to benefit beings, next clarifying the building of stūpas, therefore it is said that the seven matters clarify the beginning and end of a single transformation to the ultimate.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a19_9']	一方之佛既具此七事，十方三世佛義亦同然，故現彼土之事為此土說經之相也。	一方之佛既具此七事，十方三世佛義亦同然，故現彼土之事為此土說經之相也。	Since the Buddha in one direction possesses these seven things, the meaning of the Buddhas of the ten directions and three periods is also the same. Therefore, the events in that land are the characteristics of the Buddha speaking the sutra in this land.

['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a22_5']	然諸佛事既有六，眾生事亦有六即六趣也，故離成十二事也。	然諸佛事既有六，眾生事亦有六即六趣也，故離成十二事也。	However, since the matters of the Buddhas have six, the matters of sentient beings also have six, which are the six destinies. Therefore, they are separated into twelve matters.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a24_5']	所以《法華論》云「煩惱差別，清淨差別，煩惱差別故有六趣，清淨差別故有諸佛六事」。	所以《法華論》云「煩惱差別，清淨差別，煩惱差別故有六趣，清淨差別故有諸佛六事」。	Therefore, the Fahua Lun says: The differences in afflictions and the differences in purity. Due to the differences in afflictions, there are the six destinies. Due to the differences in purity, there are the six matters of the Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471a25_8']	今前見六趣眾生者，明眾生是七事之本，故先見之。	今前見六趣眾生者，明眾生是七事之本，故先見之。	Now, the first seeing of the sentient beings of the six destinies clarifies that sentient beings are the basis of the seven matters, so they are seen first.

['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471b07_12']	「種種因緣」者，過去習因為因，外值善友為緣，而內因不同、外緣非一，故云種種，即因緣門攝菩薩也。	「種種因緣」者，過去習因為因，外值善友為緣，而內因不同、外緣非一，故云種種，即因緣門攝菩薩也。	Various causes and conditions means that past habitual causes are the cause, and encountering good friends externally is the condition. Since internal causes are not the same and external conditions are not one, they are called various, and this includes bodhisattvas under the heading of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471b08_8']	「種種信解」者，始名為信、終稱為解。	「種種信解」者，始名為信、終稱為解。	Various beliefs and understandings means that what is initially called belief is ultimately called understanding.

['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471b12_18']	「種種相貌」者，菩薩修行必有相貌表彰，身口之行外彰為相，意業之行顯明稱貌，故以相貌門攝菩薩也。	「種種相貌」者，菩薩修行必有相貌表彰，身口之行外彰為相，意業之行顯明稱貌，故以相貌門攝菩薩也。	Various appearances means that the bodhisattva's practice must have appearances and characteristics, the practice of body and speech externally manifested as appearances, and the practice of mental activity clearly manifested as characteristics, and thus the gate of appearances and characteristics encompasses the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0471b13_17']	「行菩薩道」者，總上三事名行菩薩道。	「行菩薩道」者，總上三事名行菩薩道。	Practicing the bodhisattva path means collectively referring to the above three things as practicing the bodhisattva path.

If the latter two take practicing goodness as their essence, then when first receiving the precepts, if one has not yet practiced the perfection of saving beings, one should only receive one precept, and the bodhisattva precepts would not be complete.
['ZH_T34_1721_002:0474c14_3']	今明三戒並以止惡為體，初戒止息威儀之惡，次止不行善之惡，後止不度人之惡，故初受戒時具得三戒，但後時修行善法及度眾生耳。	今明三戒並以止惡為體，初戒止息威儀之惡，次止不行善之惡，後止不度人之惡，故初受戒時具得三戒，但後時修行善法及度眾生耳。	Now it is explained that the three precepts all take ceasing wrongdoing as their essence. The first precept ceases the wrongdoing of deportment, the next ceases the wrongdoing of not practicing goodness, and the last ceases the wrongdoing of not saving beings.
