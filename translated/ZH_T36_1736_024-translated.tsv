The essence is identical to principle, and the function is identical to phenomena. The unobstructed essence and function are identical to the unobstructed phenomena and principle, which is identical to the all-pervasiveness, and is identical to the unobstructed phenomena and phenomena.

['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183a25_11']	二應用之中自有本末，菩提座身即本，周十方即末，故下不起樹王而昇四天，正明不動本而周遍。	二應用之中自有本末，菩提座身即本，周十方即末，故下不起樹王而昇四天，正明不動本而周遍。	024	Second, within the responsive functions, there is also a basis and end. The body at the bodhi tree is the basis, and pervading the ten directions is the end. Therefore, the text below clarifies not rising from the king of trees but ascending to the four heavens, which is precisely not moving from the basis while being all-pervasive.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183a26_12']	今明雖遍法界而處此座，明不壞末而歸本。	今明雖遍法界而處此座，明不壞末而歸本。	024	Now it is clarified that although it pervades the dharma realm, it is still at this seat, clarifying not destroying the end while returning to the basis.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183a28_3']	此二不相離，故疏以「不動本而周遍」釋不壞末而歸本耳。	此二不相離，故疏以「不動本而周遍」釋不壞末而歸本耳。	024	These two are inseparable, so the commentary explains not destroying the parts while returning to the root with not moving from the root while pervading everywhere.

In order to distinguish the old understanding, it is because the retinue of Viśiṣṭaśabda praises. Therefore, it is the bodhisattvas within the assembly of Viśiṣṭaśabda.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183b15_3']	今明是新舊二種大眾海中。	今明是新舊二種大眾海中。	024	Now it is clarified that it is within the two kinds of great assembly oceans, the new and the old.

['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183b23_16']	疏「此即無礙慧身不依一切」者，上以無住本釋無依，無依是理，故無住即實相之異名。	疏「此即無礙慧身不依一切」者，上以無住本釋無依，無依是理，故無住即實相之異名。	024	The commentary states This is the unobstructed wisdom body, not relying on anything - above it used the root of non-abiding to explain non-reliance. Non-reliance is principle, therefore non-abiding is an alternate name for the true aspect.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183b26_7']	今以智慧釋無依，故〈出現品〉云「一切佛法依慈悲，慈悲復依方便立，方便依智智依慧，無礙慧身無所依」故。	今以智慧釋無依，故〈出現品〉云「一切佛法依慈悲，慈悲復依方便立，方便依智智依慧，無礙慧身無所依」故。	024	Now, using wisdom to explain non-reliance, the Appearance of the Tathagata Chapter says, All Buddha Dharmas rely on kindness and compassion, kindness and compassion are established based on skillful means, skillful means rely on wisdom, wisdom relies on discernment, the unobstructed body of discernment has no reliance.

['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183b28_3']	今釋無差，但心無分別耳。	今釋無差，但心無分別耳。	024	Now, the explanation of non-differentiation is simply that the mind is without discrimination.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183c01_4']	故無差別與無分別，有通有局，局則無差別是理、無分別約智，通則理亦得名無分別。	故無差別與無分別，有通有局，局則無差別是理、無分別約智，通則理亦得名無分別。	024	Therefore, non-differentiation and non-discrimination have both common and specific meanings. Specifically, non-differentiation is principle and non-discrimination is based on wisdom. Commonly, principle can also be called non-discrimination.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183c02_3']	故〈問明品〉云「佛剎無分別，無憎亦無愛。	故〈問明品〉云「佛剎無分別，無憎亦無愛。	024	Therefore, the Chapter on Questions and Answers says, Buddha lands are without discrimination, without aversion and without attachment.

['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183c03_17']	今用通義，以無分別釋無差別。	今用通義，以無分別釋無差別。	024	Now, using the common meaning, non-discrimination is used to explain non-differentiation.

['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183c13_2']	引《金光明》，已如上引，即〈三身品〉。	引《金光明》，已如上引，即〈三身品〉。	024	Citing the Suvarṇa-prabhāsa, as already cited above, is from the Chapter on the Three Bodies.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183c14_3']	疏「望前應身即重化」者，應身對法報，應身是化身。	疏「望前應身即重化」者，應身對法報，應身是化身。	024	If we look at it from the perspective of the responsive body, it is a repeated transformation means that the responsive body is compared to the Dharma body and the reward body, and the responsive body is the transformation body.
['ZH_T36_1736_024:0183c14_16']	今於應身上起化，故云重化。	今於應身上起化，故云重化。	024	Now, transformation arises on top of the responsive body, so it is called a repeated transformation.
