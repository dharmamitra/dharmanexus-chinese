['ZH_T38_1779_003:0741c19_13']	但當教佛於禪自在，故云離愛。	但當教佛於禪自在，故云離愛。	003	One should only teach the Buddha's mastery over dhyāna, therefore it says free from attachment.
['ZH_T38_1779_003:0741c20_16']	所以羅漢但云無間超入超出，然論自在猶不及佛。	所以羅漢但云無間超入超出，然論自在猶不及佛。	003	Therefore, arhats are only said to be able to enter and emerge from dhyāna without interruption, but in terms of mastery they are still not equal to the Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1779_003:0741c21_12']	又今約教者，皆附前文從因義邊。	又今約教者，皆附前文從因義邊。	003	Moreover, in terms of the teachings, all are based on the previous text from the perspective of causes.

The reason why both teachings have the profound and the true and conditioned is because if they are not explained in terms of the stages, how can they be distinguished?

['ZH_T38_1779_003:0742a12_18']	橫周法界故無量，竪徹三諦故甚深。	橫周法界故無量，竪徹三諦故甚深。	003	It is immeasurable because it extends horizontally throughout the Dharma realm, and it is profound because it penetrates vertically through the three truths.
['ZH_T38_1779_003:0742a13_13']	「過諸」下，顯佛心境智出過九禪。	「過諸」下，顯佛心境智出過九禪。	003	Surpassing all reveals that the Buddha's mind, realm, and wisdom surpass the nine dhyānas.

Being able to contemplate this principle and attain the name of having already crossed over, therefore the words of the various dhyāna concentrations include the ground before and the first two teachings.

The path and cessation are called good in the internal realm, but because ignorance is still present, they are still considered evil from the perspective of the external realm.

The title Mahayana only applies to the supramundane. Therefore, the loose explanation of the Mahayana only speaks of the four teachings.

Since the bodhisattvas of the four teachings both seek the Buddha fruit above and transform sentient beings below, they encompass the upper and lower, and are vast and great.
['ZH_T38_1779_003:0750b23_3']	二乘自度，求化俱無，包廣義乖，故名為小。	二乘自度，求化俱無，包廣義乖，故名為小。	003	The Two Vehicles have no seeking or transforming of their own, and are incompatible with the meaning of vastness, therefore they are called small.

Relying on the object to give rise to vows, practicing to fulfill the vows, self-propelled goes from cause to effect, propelling others goes from ordinary to sage, self and others both propelled, the meaning of the vehicle lies in this.

['ZH_T38_1779_003:0753a19_11']	於通教中，上根菩薩初地見真，義當三人共位見真。	於通教中，上根菩薩初地見真，義當三人共位見真。	003	Among the common teachings, the upper-level bodhisattvas see reality at the first stage, which corresponds to the three people sharing the stage of seeing reality.
['ZH_T38_1779_003:0753a21_1']	「入第三地為深心」者，此十三句中云深心者，非前三心之深心也。	「入第三地為深心」者，此十三句中云深心者，非前三心之深心也。	003	Entering the third stage is the profound mind - among these thirteen phrases, the profound mind is not the profound mind of the first three minds.

['ZH_T38_1779_003:0753b03_4']	通教初地未名直故，故可借別以名於通，初地斷見仍成通義。	通教初地未名直故，故可借別以名於通，初地斷見仍成通義。	003	Because the first stage of the Shared Teaching is not yet called direct, therefore it can borrow the Distinct Teaching to name the Shared Teaching, and the first stage cutting off views still forms the meaning of the Shared Teaching.
['ZH_T38_1779_003:0753b04_3']	又復通教地前無賢，故第十地含於三句。	又復通教地前無賢，故第十地含於三句。	003	Moreover, because there is no sage before the stages in the Shared Teaching, the tenth stage includes the three phrases.

['ZH_T38_1779_003:0753b09_15']	又菩薩雖知佛猶永滅，永滅乃與取土義乖，故知此佛無人有教。	又菩薩雖知佛猶永滅，永滅乃與取土義乖，故知此佛無人有教。	003	Moreover, although the bodhisattvas know that the Buddha still eternally ceases, eternal cessation is contrary to the meaning of taking the land. Therefore, it is known that this Buddha has no one but has the teaching.
['ZH_T38_1779_003:0753b10_15']	教既權施，不稱因行，故於權教不須苦窮。	教既權施，不稱因行，故於權教不須苦窮。	003	Since the teaching is provisionally established, it does not accord with the practice of causes, so it is not necessary to exhaust the provisional teaching.

Next, I will again discuss the fourteen kinds of prajñā. This is because the names are convenient in terms of opening and closing, and because the principles are combined, the names are common to the beginning and end.

It definitely does not use the names to restrict the meaning. Therefore, it is said that there is no place where it does not apply.
