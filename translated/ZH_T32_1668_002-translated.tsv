All dharmas only exist due to deluded thoughts, and if one departs from mental thoughts then there are no characteristics of any external realms.
['ZH_T32_1668_002:0605b08_13']	是故一切法從本已來，離言說相、離名字相、離心緣相，畢竟平等、無有變異、不可破壞，唯是一心，故名真如。	是故一切法從本已來，離言說相、離名字相、離心緣相，畢竟平等、無有變異、不可破壞，唯是一心，故名真如。	002	Therefore, all dharmas from the very beginning are devoid of the characteristics of speech, devoid of the characteristics of names and words, and devoid of the characteristics of mental activity.

['ZH_T32_1668_002:0605b26_3']	當知真如自性，非有相、非無相、非非有相、非非無相、非有無俱相，非一相、非異相、非非一相、非非異相、非一異俱相，乃至總說依一切眾生以有妄心念念分別皆不相應故說為空。	當知真如自性，非有相、非無相、非非有相、非非無相、非有無俱相，非一相、非異相、非非一相、非非異相、非一異俱相，乃至總說依一切眾生以有妄心念念分別皆不相應故說為空。	002	One should know that the nature of suchness is neither a characteristic of existence, nor a characteristic of non-existence, nor a characteristic of neither existence nor non-existence, nor a characteristic of both existence and non-existence, neither a single characteristic nor a different characteristic, nor a characteristic of neither being the same nor different, nor a characteristic of both being the same and different, and so on. In summary, it is said to be empty because it is not in accord with all sentient beings who have deluded minds and conceptual thoughts moment by moment.
['ZH_T32_1668_002:0605b26_14']	若離妄心，實無可空故。	若離妄心，實無可空故。	002	If one departs from deluded mind, there is truly nothing to be emptied, and therefore it is said to be not empty.

This is called not empty, and there is also no characteristic that can be grasped, because the realm of the absence of thought is only in accord with the characteristics of realization.
