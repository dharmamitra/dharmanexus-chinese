First, in explaining the name, the Mahāyānasaṃgraha says: By the wisdom of dependent origination, one is able to make the perfection of prajñā directly present, therefore it is called the ground of direct presence.

['ZH_T35_1733_013:0342b25_8']	二四地雖出世不能隨，五地能隨世間而不能破染淨見，此地觀察無染淨法界破彼見故，是故來也。	二四地雖出世不能隨，五地能隨世間而不能破染淨見，此地觀察無染淨法界破彼見故，是故來也。	Second, although the fourth and fifth grounds transcend the world, they cannot follow it. The fifth ground can follow the world but cannot destroy the view of defiled and pure dharmas. This ground observes the undefiled dharma realm and destroys that view, therefore it comes.

In the sixth ground, there is much non-conceptualized meditation and little conceptualized meditation. From the seventh ground onward, there is only non-conceptualized meditation.

In reality, it is a part of the innate obstacle to that which is to be known that grasps subtle defilement and purity, which contradicts the undefiled dharma realm of the sixth ground, and is therefore considered an obstacle.
['ZH_T35_1733_013:0342c05_13']	良以五地超於三四染淨別位，合令同處而二相未盡，至此方除，故說微細。	良以五地超於三四染淨別位，合令同處而二相未盡，至此方除，故說微細。	It is precisely because the fifth ground surpasses the third and fourth, where the positions of defiled and pure are separate, that they are combined into the same place, but the two aspects are not yet exhausted. It is only at this point that they are eliminated, so it is said to be subtle.
['ZH_T35_1733_013:0342c08_5']	《唯識論》云「名麁相現行障，謂所知障中俱生一分執有染淨麁相現行，彼障六地無染淨道，入六地時便能永斷。	《唯識論》云「名麁相現行障，謂所知障中俱生一分執有染淨麁相現行，彼障六地無染淨道，入六地時便能永斷。	The Vijñaptimātratā-śāstra says, The obstacle of the coarse appearance of discrimination, that is, a part of the obstacle to that which is to be known that is innate, which is the appearance of the coarse aspects of defilement and purity. It obstructs the path of non-defilement and non-purity of the sixth ground. Upon entering the sixth ground, one is able to permanently eliminate it.

The contemplation of characteristics is frequently practiced, and one is still unable to dwell for a long time in the contemplation of the absence of characteristics.

The second is the ignorance of the mind being repeatedly directed towards the characteristics of dharmas.

['ZH_T35_1733_013:0342c16_8']	此後無明還滅淨相數於心現，違彼長時多無相觀，故以為障。	此後無明還滅淨相數於心現，違彼長時多無相觀，故以為障。	This latter ignorance still extinguishes the pure characteristics that repeatedly appear in the mind, contradicting the long-lasting and numerous samādhis without characteristics, and is therefore taken as an obstacle.

That is, the approach to the stage and the initial abiding in the stage are both called the counteraction of the superior conceit. Here, the initial abiding in the stage is subsumed in the superior practice of entering the non-abiding path, because it is gradually superior.

The śrāvakas are not aware of subtle suffering and consider themselves to be without suffering, which is called overweening pride. However, being aware of coarse suffering is not overweening pride.
