['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a07_16']	煩惱障中見所斷種，於極喜地見道初斷，彼障現起地前已伏。	煩惱障中見所斷種，於極喜地見道初斷，彼障現起地前已伏。	Among the afflictive obstacles, the seeds to be eliminated by the path of seeing are first eliminated in the path of seeing in the stage of Extreme Joy. Their manifest activity is subdued before the [ten] stages.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a08_15']	修所斷種，金剛喻定現在前時一切頓斷。	修所斷種，金剛喻定現在前時一切頓斷。	The seeds to be eliminated by cultivation are all suddenly eliminated when the diamond-like samādhi is present.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a11_12']	彼障現起地前漸伏，初地以上能頓伏盡令永不行，如阿羅漢由故意力前七地中雖暫現起而不為失，八地以上畢竟不行。	彼障現起地前漸伏，初地以上能頓伏盡令永不行，如阿羅漢由故意力前七地中雖暫現起而不為失，八地以上畢竟不行。	Their manifest activity is gradually subdued before the [ten] stages. Beginning from the first stage, they are suddenly subdued and never allowed to occur again. Like an arhat, by the power of intentional effort, although they temporarily manifest in the first seven stages, it is not a fault. From the eighth stage onward, they never occur again.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a13_2']	所知障中見所斷種，於極喜地見道初斷，彼障現起地前已伏。	所知障中見所斷種，於極喜地見道初斷，彼障現起地前已伏。	Among the obstacles to that which is to be known, the seeds to be eliminated by the path of seeing are first eliminated in the path of seeing in the stage of Extreme Joy. Their manifest activity is subdued before the [ten] stages.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a14_9']	修所斷種，於十地中漸次斷滅，金剛喻定現在前時方永斷盡。	修所斷種，於十地中漸次斷滅，金剛喻定現在前時方永斷盡。	The seeds to be eliminated by cultivation are gradually eliminated during the ten stages. When the diamond-like samādhi is present, they are permanently eliminated without remainder.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a16_16']	彼障現起地前漸伏，乃至十地方永伏盡，八地以上六識俱者不復現行，無漏觀心及果相續能違彼故。	彼障現起地前漸伏，乃至十地方永伏盡，八地以上六識俱者不復現行，無漏觀心及果相續能違彼故。	The obstacle is gradually subdued before the stage of the ten faiths, and when one reaches the ten stages, it is forever subdued and completely eliminated. That which is associated with the first six consciousnesses is not manifested in the eighth stage and above, because the pure contemplation and its fruit continue and oppose it.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a17_15']	第七俱者猶可現行，法空智果起位方伏。	第七俱者猶可現行，法空智果起位方伏。	That which is associated with the seventh consciousness is still manifested, but it is subdued when the fruit of the knowledge of the emptiness of the person is produced.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a18_14']	前五轉識設未轉依，無漏伏故障不現起。	前五轉識設未轉依，無漏伏故障不現起。	Even though the first six consciousnesses have not yet been transformed, when they are pure, they subdue the obstacle and prevent its manifestation.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a21_3']	雖於修道十地位中皆不斷滅煩惱障種，而彼麁重亦漸斷滅，由斯故說二障麁重一一皆有三位斷義。	雖於修道十地位中皆不斷滅煩惱障種，而彼麁重亦漸斷滅，由斯故說二障麁重一一皆有三位斷義。	Even though in the ten stages of the path of cultivation one does not completely eliminate the seeds of the obstacle of the passions, still one gradually eliminates their coarseness. Consequently, it is said that the two obstacles, i.e., the obstacle of the passions and the obstacle to that which is to be known, each have three aspects of elimination.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a22_3']	雖諸位中皆斷麁重，而三位顯，是故偏說。	雖諸位中皆斷麁重，而三位顯，是故偏說。	Even though one eliminates coarseness in all stages, still the three aspects are evident, and therefore it is said that they are eliminated in the three stages.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a22_13']	斷二障種，漸頓云何？	斷二障種，漸頓云何？	How is the elimination of the two obstacles gradual or sudden?
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a24_1']	第七識俱煩惱障種，三乘將得無學果時，一剎那中三界頓斷；	第七識俱煩惱障種，三乘將得無學果時，一剎那中三界頓斷；	The seeds of the obstacle of the passions associated with the seventh consciousness are suddenly eliminated in one instant when the three vehicles are about to attain the fruit of post-learing.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a25_10']	所知障種，將成佛時，一剎那中一切頓斷，任運內起無麁細故。	所知障種，將成佛時，一剎那中一切頓斷，任運內起無麁細故。	Seeds of the obstacle to that which is to be known are suddenly eliminated in one instant at the time of becoming a Buddha, because they arise spontaneously and internally and are neither gross nor subtle.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054a26_17']	餘六識俱煩惱障種，見所斷者，三乘見位真見道中一切頓斷；	餘六識俱煩惱障種，見所斷者，三乘見位真見道中一切頓斷；	Seeds of the obstacle of the passions associated with the other six consciousnesses are suddenly eliminated in the path of insight of the three vehicles, that is, in the path of insight of the one vehicle.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b01_4']	修所斷者，隨其所應一類二乘三界九地一一漸次九品別斷，一類二乘三界九地合為一聚九品別斷，菩薩要起金剛喻定一剎那中三界頓斷。	修所斷者，隨其所應一類二乘三界九地一一漸次九品別斷，一類二乘三界九地合為一聚九品別斷，菩薩要起金剛喻定一剎那中三界頓斷。	Those eliminated by cultivation are eliminated gradually, in accordance with the case, by the two kinds of saints of the three realms and nine stages, that is, the nine classes are eliminated separately in each of the stages. The two kinds of saints of the three realms and nine stages together form one group, and the nine classes are eliminated separately in this group. Bodhisattvas suddenly eliminate the three realms in one instant when they generate the Diamond-like Samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b05_1']	所知障種，初地初心頓斷一切見所斷者，修所斷者後於十地修道位中漸次而斷，乃至正起金剛喻定一剎那中方皆斷盡，通緣內外麁細境生品類差別有眾多故。	所知障種，初地初心頓斷一切見所斷者，修所斷者後於十地修道位中漸次而斷，乃至正起金剛喻定一剎那中方皆斷盡，通緣內外麁細境生品類差別有眾多故。	Seeds of the obstacle to that which is to be known are suddenly eliminated in the first instant of the first stage, that is, all those eliminated by the path of insight. Those eliminated by the path of cultivation are gradually eliminated in the path of cultivation of the ten stages, and when one generates the Diamond-like Samādhi in the tenth stage, they are all eliminated. They are eliminated in this way because they are born in many different classes, gross and subtle, internally and externally.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b06_1']	二乘根鈍漸斷障時，必各別起無間解脫。	二乘根鈍漸斷障時，必各別起無間解脫。	The two vehicles, because their faculties are dull, must each separately generate uninterrupted and liberated paths when they are gradually eliminating obstacles.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b07_17']	加行勝進或別或總，菩薩利根漸斷障位，非要別起無間解脫，剎那剎那能斷證故。	加行勝進或別或總，菩薩利根漸斷障位，非要別起無間解脫，剎那剎那能斷證故。	The paths of preparation and of added effort may be either separate or combined. Bodhisattvas, because their faculties are sharp, when they are gradually eliminating obstacles, do not necessarily generate separate uninterrupted and liberated paths, because they are able to eliminate and realize in each instant.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b08_16']	加行等四，剎那剎那前後相望皆容具有。	加行等四，剎那剎那前後相望皆容具有。	The four paths of preparation, etc., in each instant are all present in relation to each other.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b10_8']	十真如者，一遍行真如，謂此真如二空所顯，無有一法而不在故。	十真如者，一遍行真如，謂此真如二空所顯，無有一法而不在故。	The ten kinds of true suchness are as follows: 1. The true suchness of universal equal flow, that is, this true suchness revealed by the twofold emptiness, because there is not a single dharma that it does not include.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b11_14']	二最勝真如，謂此真如具無邊德，於一切法最為勝故。	二最勝真如，謂此真如具無邊德，於一切法最為勝故。	2. The true suchness of supremacy, that is, this true suchness endowed with boundless qualities, because it is supreme among all dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b13_2']	三勝流真如，謂此真如所流教法，於餘教法極為勝故。	三勝流真如，謂此真如所流教法，於餘教法極為勝故。	3. The true suchness of supreme flow, that is, the teachings that flow from this true suchness are supreme among all other teachings.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b14_8']	四無攝受真如，謂此真如無所繫屬，非我執等所依取故。	四無攝受真如，謂此真如無所繫屬，非我執等所依取故。	4. The true suchness of nonapprehending, that is, this true suchness is not subject to any grasping, because it is not the support or object of the grasping of self, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b15_14']	五類無別真如，謂此真如類無差別，非如眼等類有異故。	五類無別真如，謂此真如類無差別，非如眼等類有異故。	The fifth is the suchness of the absence of distinctions among the five dharmas, that is, this suchness is without distinctions among its varieties, unlike the eye, etc., which have different varieties.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b17_3']	六無染淨真如，謂此真如本性無染，亦不可說後方淨故。	六無染淨真如，謂此真如本性無染，亦不可說後方淨故。	The sixth is the suchness of nondefilement and nonpurification, that is, this suchness is by nature devoid of defilement and cannot be said to be purified later.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b18_8']	七法無別真如，謂此真如雖多教法種種安立而無異故。	七法無別真如，謂此真如雖多教法種種安立而無異故。	The seventh is the suchness of the absence of distinctions among dharmas, that is, although there are many teachings and various establishments of dharmas, there are no distinctions in suchness.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b19_14']	八不增減真如，謂此真如離增減執，不隨淨染有增減故。	八不增減真如，謂此真如離增減執，不隨淨染有增減故。	The eighth is the suchness of neither increase nor decrease, that is, this suchness is apart from the grasping of increase and decrease and does not increase or decrease in accordance with purity or defilement.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b21_10']	即此亦名相土自在所依真如，謂若證得此真如已，現相現土俱自在故。	即此亦名相土自在所依真如，謂若證得此真如已，現相現土俱自在故。	This is also called the suchness that is the support of mastery over images and lands, because once this suchness is realized, one has mastery over the manifestation of images and lands.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b23_1']	九智自在所依真如，謂若證得此真如已，於無礙解得自在故。	九智自在所依真如，謂若證得此真如已，於無礙解得自在故。	The ninth is the suchness that is the support of mastery over knowledge, because once this suchness is realized, one attains mastery over unobstructed understanding.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b24_18']	十業自在等所依真如，謂若證得此真如已，普於一切神通作業總持定門皆自在故。	十業自在等所依真如，謂若證得此真如已，普於一切神通作業總持定門皆自在故。	The tenth is the suchness that is the support of mastery over actions, etc., because once this suchness is realized, one has mastery over all spiritual powers, actions, dhāraṇīs, and samādhis.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b25_17']	雖真如性實無差別，而隨勝德假立十種。	雖真如性實無差別，而隨勝德假立十種。	Although the nature of suchness is really without distinction, it is provisionally established as ten kinds in accordance with its superior virtues.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b27_8']	雖初地中已達一切，而能證行猶未圓滿，為令圓滿後後建立。	雖初地中已達一切，而能證行猶未圓滿，為令圓滿後後建立。	Although one has penetrated all of it in the first stage, the practice of realization is still not perfect, and the following stages are established in order to perfect it.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054b29_18']	如是菩薩於十地中勇猛修行十種勝行、斷十重障、證十真如，於二轉依便能證得。	如是菩薩於十地中勇猛修行十種勝行、斷十重障、證十真如，於二轉依便能證得。	Thus the bodhisattva, in the ten stages, heroically practices ten kinds of superior practices, eliminates ten kinds of obstacles, realizes ten kinds of suchness, and is able to realize the two transmutations.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c01_8']	轉依位別略有六種：	轉依位別略有六種：	There are, in brief, six states of transmutation of the support.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c04_14']	一損力益能轉，謂初二位，由習勝解及慚愧故，損本識中染種勢力、益本識內淨種功能，雖未斷障種實證轉依，而漸伏現行，亦名為轉。	一損力益能轉，謂初二位，由習勝解及慚愧故，損本識中染種勢力、益本識內淨種功能，雖未斷障種實證轉依，而漸伏現行，亦名為轉。	The first is the transmutation of support that weakens the power of impure seeds in the root consciousness and increases the power of pure seeds in the root consciousness through the practice of superior resolve and shame and a sense of decency. Although one has not yet eliminated the seeds of the obstacles and really realized the transmutation of the support, one gradually subdues actual passions, which is also called transmutation.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c06_13']	二通達轉，謂通達位，由見道力通達真如，斷分別生二障麁重，證得一分真實轉依。	二通達轉，謂通達位，由見道力通達真如，斷分別生二障麁重，證得一分真實轉依。	The second is the transmutation of penetrating insight, which is the state of penetrating insight. Through the power of the path of insight, one penetrates suchness, eliminates the coarseness of the two obstacles born of discrimination, and realizes a part of the true transmutation of the support.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c08_12']	三修習轉，謂修習位，由數修習十地行故，漸斷俱生二障麁重，漸次證得真實轉依。	三修習轉，謂修習位，由數修習十地行故，漸斷俱生二障麁重，漸次證得真實轉依。	The third is the transmutation of cultivation, which refers to the state of cultivation. As a result of repeated cultivation of the practices of the ten stages, one gradually eliminates the coarseness of the two obstacles and gradually realizes the transmutation of the support that is true suchness.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c12_8']	《攝大乘》中說通達轉在前六地有無相觀，通達真俗間雜現前，令真非真現不現故，說修習轉在後四地，純無相觀長時現前，勇猛修習斷餘麁重，多令非真不顯現故。	《攝大乘》中說通達轉在前六地有無相觀，通達真俗間雜現前，令真非真現不現故，說修習轉在後四地，純無相觀長時現前，勇猛修習斷餘麁重，多令非真不顯現故。	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says that the transmutation of understanding is in the first six stages, because nonconceptual wisdom and the realization of the two truths alternate in being present, causing the true and the false to appear and disappear. It is said that the transmutation of cultivation is in the last four stages, because pure nonconceptual wisdom is present for a long time, one courageously cultivates and eliminates the remaining coarseness, and causes the false to be mostly invisible.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c16_1']	四果圓滿轉，謂究竟位，由三大劫阿僧企耶修集無邊難行勝行，金剛喻定現在前時，永斷本來一切麁重，頓證佛果圓滿轉依，窮未來際利樂無盡。	四果圓滿轉，謂究竟位，由三大劫阿僧企耶修集無邊難行勝行，金剛喻定現在前時，永斷本來一切麁重，頓證佛果圓滿轉依，窮未來際利樂無盡。	The fourth is the transmutation of perfect fruition, which refers to the ultimate stage. As a result of cultivating boundless difficult practices for three great incalculable eons, when the samādhi that is like vajra is present, one eternally eliminates all coarseness that has existed from beginningless time, suddenly realizes the perfect transmutation of the support that is the result of Buddhahood, and benefits and gladdens inexhaustibly for all time.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c18_11']	五下劣轉，謂二乘位，專求自利厭苦欣寂，唯能通達生空真如，斷煩惱種，證真擇滅，無勝堪能，名下劣轉。	五下劣轉，謂二乘位，專求自利厭苦欣寂，唯能通達生空真如，斷煩惱種，證真擇滅，無勝堪能，名下劣轉。	The fifth is the inferior transformation, which refers to the stage of the two vehicles, which is exclusively for the sake of one's own benefit, despising suffering and delighting in quiescence, only able to penetrate the suchness of the emptiness of beings, eliminating the seeds of the passions, realizing true cessation, and lacking superior ability, called the inferior transformation.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c21_18']	六廣大轉，謂大乘位，為利他故趣大菩提，生死涅槃俱無欣厭，具能通達二空真如，雙斷所知煩惱障種，頓證無上菩提涅槃，有勝堪能，名廣大轉。	六廣大轉，謂大乘位，為利他故趣大菩提，生死涅槃俱無欣厭，具能通達二空真如，雙斷所知煩惱障種，頓證無上菩提涅槃，有勝堪能，名廣大轉。	The sixth is the vast transformation, which refers to the stage of the Great Vehicle, which is for the sake of benefiting others, seeking great enlightenment, neither despising saṃsāra nor delighting in nirvāṇa, fully able to penetrate the suchness of the emptiness of both beings and dharmas, eliminating the seeds of both the obstacle to that which is to be known and the obstacle of the passions, suddenly realizing unsurpassed enlightenment and nirvāṇa, having superior ability, called the vast transformation.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c22_17']	此中意說廣大轉依，捨二麁重而證得故。	此中意說廣大轉依，捨二麁重而證得故。	The meaning here is to speak of the vast transformation, because it abandons the two kinds of coarseness and realizes attainment.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c23_8']	轉依義別略有四種：	轉依義別略有四種：	The meaning of the transformation of the support is distinguished in brief as four kinds:
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c23_13']	一能轉道。	一能轉道。	The first is the path that is able to transform.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c23_18']	此復有二：	此復有二：	This is further divided into two:
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c25_5']	一能伏道，謂伏二障隨眠勢力，令不引起二障現行。	一能伏道，謂伏二障隨眠勢力，令不引起二障現行。	The first is the path that is able to subdue, which means subduing the power of the propensities of the two obstacles, preventing them from giving rise to the actual dharmas of the two obstacles.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c26_12']	此通有漏無漏二道加行根本，後得三智隨其所應漸頓伏彼。	此通有漏無漏二道加行根本，後得三智隨其所應漸頓伏彼。	This path is of two kinds, pure and impure, and it is of three kinds, path of added effort, proximate path, and liberation path. It gradually or suddenly subdues the passions.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c27_8']	二能斷道，謂能永斷二障隨眠。	二能斷道，謂能永斷二障隨眠。	The second is the path of severing, that is, the path that can eternally eliminate the propensities of the two obstacles.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0054c29_7']	此道定非有漏加行，有漏曾習相執所引未泯相故，加行趣求所證所引未成辦故。	此道定非有漏加行，有漏曾習相執所引未泯相故，加行趣求所證所引未成辦故。	This path is definitely not impure or the path of added effort, because the impure path is attracted by the grasping of characteristics that have been cultivated and has not yet eliminated characteristics, and because the path of added effort is attracted by the seeking of the realization of the truth and has not yet accomplished it.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a01_16']	有義，根本無分別智親證二空所顯真理，無境相故能斷隨眠；	有義，根本無分別智親證二空所顯真理，無境相故能斷隨眠；	There is an interpretation that the fundamental nonconceptual cognition directly realizes the truth revealed by the twofold emptiness and, being devoid of the appearance of objects, is able to sever the propensities.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a02_8']	後得不然，故非斷道。	後得不然，故非斷道。	Subsequent cognition is not like this, and therefore it is not a path of severing.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a05_6']	有義，後得無分別智雖不親證二空真理，無力能斷迷理隨眠，而於安立非安立相明了現前無倒證故，亦能永斷迷事隨眠。	有義，後得無分別智雖不親證二空真理，無力能斷迷理隨眠，而於安立非安立相明了現前無倒證故，亦能永斷迷事隨眠。	According to another interpretation, even though subsequent nonconceptual cognition does not directly realize the truth of the twofold emptiness, it is powerless to sever the propensities that are confused about the truth, but it is able to eternally eliminate the propensities that are confused about things, because it clearly manifests the images of the established and unestablished and realizes them without error.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a07_8']	故《瑜伽》說修道位中有出世斷道、世出世斷道，無純世間道能永害隨眠，是曾習故相執引故。	故《瑜伽》說修道位中有出世斷道、世出世斷道，無純世間道能永害隨眠，是曾習故相執引故。	Therefore the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that in the path of cultivation there is a supramundane path of elimination and a supramundane path of elimination, and there is no pure mundane path that can eternally destroy the propensities, because it is something that has been practiced and because it is attracted by the grasping of characteristics.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a09_6']	由斯理趣，諸見所斷及修所斷迷理隨眠，唯有根本無分別智親證理故能正斷彼。	由斯理趣，諸見所斷及修所斷迷理隨眠，唯有根本無分別智親證理故能正斷彼。	As a consequence of this principle, the seeds of the passions that are eliminated by the path of insight and the seeds of the passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation and that are confused about the principle of reality can only be eliminated by the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge that directly realizes reality.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a10_5', 'ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a10_10']	餘修所斷迷事隨眠，根本後得俱能正斷。🔽二所轉依。	餘修所斷迷事隨眠，根本後得俱能正斷。 二所轉依。	The remaining seeds of the passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation and that are confused about the characteristics of things can be eliminated by both the fundamental and subsequently acquired knowledge.🔽The second kind of transformation is the transformation of the support.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a10_15']	此復有二：	此復有二：	This is twofold.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a11_3']	一持種依，謂本識。	一持種依，謂本識。	The first is the support that holds the seeds, which is the fundamental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_010:0055a12_12']	由此能持染淨法種，與染淨法俱為所依，聖道轉令捨染得淨。	由此能持染淨法種，與染淨法俱為所依，聖道轉令捨染得淨。	It is able to hold the seeds of impure and pure dharmas and is the support of impure and pure dharmas. The holy path transforms it so that it abandons the impure and obtains the pure.

It is equally shared by all sentient beings, and is neither the same as nor different from all dharmas. It is free from all characteristics and all conceptualization.

The five consciousnesses of a Buddha, although they transform on the basis of the above, are not categorized as the five objects because they differ from them in coarseness and subtlety.

It is good because it is the nature of pure good dharmas, because the pure realm of the Dharma is free from arising and cessation and is supremely tranquil, and because the class of mind of the four knowledges has marvelous functioning without limit and is supremely skillful.

Dwelling in a pure land, it manifests great spiritual powers for the multitudes of bodhisattvas dwelling on the ten stages, turns the wheel of the true Dharma, and resolves the multitudes of doubts, causing them to enjoy the bliss of the Dharma of the Great Vehicle.

It resides in pure and impure lands and, in accordance with the capacities of the multitudes of bodhisattvas who have not yet entered the ten stages, disciples, and ordinary people, it manifests spiritual powers and preaches the Dharma, causing each to obtain the various benefits of weal.

The Buddha bodies manifested by the class of knowledge of sameness are included in the body of enjoyment for others. The various kinds of bodies manifested by the class of knowledge of achieving the task are included in the transformation body.

Therefore, it is not mentioned in the above passage.
