['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b20_8']	信解義，六門分別：	信解義，六門分別：	007	The meaning of belief and understanding is analyzed in six aspects:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b20_14']	一、來意門；	一、來意門；	007	1. The aspect of the reason for the chapter;
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b20_20']	二、釋名門；	二、釋名門；	007	2. The aspect of explaining the name;

['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b23_11']	來意門者，為中根人說法凡有四章，初正說已竟，今是第二中根領解也。	來意門者，為中根人說法凡有四章，初正說已竟，今是第二中根領解也。	007	As for the aspect of the reason for the chapter, the teaching is given to those of middling faculties in four parts. The first, the correct teaching, has already been completed. This is the second, the middling faculties' understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b23_13']	問：	問：	007	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b25_14']	〈方便品〉云「若實得阿羅漢，不信此法無有是處」，若爾聞初法說即應領悟，何待譬喻方信解耶？	〈方便品〉云「若實得阿羅漢，不信此法無有是處」，若爾聞初法說即應領悟，何待譬喻方信解耶？	007	The chapter on skillful means says, If one truly attains arhatship, it is impossible for them not to believe in this teaching. If that is so, then upon hearing the initial teaching they should immediately understand. Why do they only believe and understand after the parables?
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b25_16', 'ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b26_10']	答：🔽經言必信者，蓋據始終為言耳。	答： 經言必信者，蓋據始終為言耳。	007	Answer:🔽The sutra says they must believe, but this is said in terms of the beginning and end.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b27_1']	不言初法說即能信解。	不言初法說即能信解。	007	It does not say that they can believe and understand upon hearing the initial teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542b29_4']	又中根之人初聞法說虛心已信，但由未解故至譬喻方得分明，所以今文與〈方便品〉不相違也。	又中根之人初聞法說虛心已信，但由未解故至譬喻方得分明，所以今文與〈方便品〉不相違也。	007	Moreover, those of middling faculties first hear the doctrinal explanation and believe it with an open mind, but because they have not yet understood, they only attain clarity when they reach the parables. Therefore, the present text does not contradict the chapter on skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c01_10']	二、釋名門者，然信解之名有離有合，所言離者凡有三義：	二、釋名門者，然信解之名有離有合，所言離者凡有三義：	007	Second, in the section on explaining the name, the name of faith and understanding can be either separate or combined. The separate explanation has three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c02_2']	一者、疑除稱信，執破名解。	一者、疑除稱信，執破名解。	007	First, the removal of doubt is called faith, and the breaking of attachment is called understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c02_15']	疑是猶預之名，信是決定旨。	疑是猶預之名，信是決定旨。	007	Doubt is the name for indecision, while faith is the principle of determination.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c04_8']	聲聞猶預權實、踟蹰一三，此疑既息故稱為信，即信三是權、信一為實也。	聲聞猶預權實、踟蹰一三，此疑既息故稱為信，即信三是權、信一為實也。	007	The śrāvakas are undecided about the expedient and the real, and hesitate between one and three. Since this doubt has been eliminated, it is called faith. It means believing that the three are expedient and believing that the one is real.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c05_8']	執破名解者，解是了悟為義，執是迷執之名。	執破名解者，解是了悟為義，執是迷執之名。	007	As for the breaking of attachment is called understanding, understanding has the meaning of realization, while attachment is the name for deluded grasping.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c06_11']	既執三為實有，則封一為實無，此執既除是故稱解。	既執三為實有，則封一為實無，此執既除是故稱解。	007	Since one grasps the three as truly existent, one then regards the one as truly nonexistent. Since this attachment has been removed, it is therefore called understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c07_3']	解者解三是無、悟一為有。	解者解三是無、悟一為有。	007	Understanding means understanding that the three are nonexistent and realizing that the one exists.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c08_11']	此釋出《注法華經》，故彼云「不疑所譬曰信，遂悔封言稱解」也。	此釋出《注法華經》，故彼云「不疑所譬曰信，遂悔封言稱解」也。	007	This explanation comes from the Commentary on the Lotus Sutra, which states: Not doubting the parables is called faith, and finally regretting and sealing words is called understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c09_4']	二者、信起於不信，解生於不解。	二者、信起於不信，解生於不解。	007	Second, faith arises from disbelief, and understanding arises from misunderstanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c10_4']	不信者不信三權一實，此心遂改是故生信。	不信者不信三權一實，此心遂改是故生信。	007	Those who do not believe do not believe in the three provisional and one actual, and this mind is then changed, therefore giving rise to faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c12_19']	信者信三為權、信一為實，雖復信三為權，未解所以權，雖信一為實，未悟所以實，今遂悟所以權、遂解所以實，故名為解。	信者信三為權、信一為實，雖復信三為權，未解所以權，雖信一為實，未悟所以實，今遂悟所以權、遂解所以實，故名為解。	007	Those who have faith believe that the three are provisional and the one is actual. Although they believe that the three are provisional, they do not yet understand why they are provisional. Although they believe that the one is actual, they are not yet enlightened as to why it is actual. Now they finally understand why they are provisional and finally understand why it is actual, therefore it is called understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c13_10']	此即信在其初、解在其後。	此即信在其初、解在其後。	007	This then places faith at the beginning and understanding at the end.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c14_12', 'ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c15_5']	故《智度論》云「信為能入、智為能度」，即其證也。🔽然初信非無有解，但解淺故名信；	故《智度論》云「信為能入、智為能度」，即其證也。 然初信非無有解，但解淺故名信；	007	Therefore the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says: Faith is what enables entry, and wisdom is what enables crossing, which is the proof.🔽However, the initial faith is not without understanding, but because the understanding is shallow it is called faith;
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c15_19']	後解非無有前信，信深故名解。	後解非無有前信，信深故名解。	007	the subsequent understanding is not without the previous faith, but because the faith is deep it is called understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c17_16']	三者、信破邪見，解破無明，故《涅槃經》云「有信無慧則長無明，有慧無信則長邪見」。	三者、信破邪見，解破無明，故《涅槃經》云「有信無慧則長無明，有慧無信則長邪見」。	007	Third, faith destroys wrong views, and understanding destroys ignorance. Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, Having faith without wisdom prolongs ignorance, having wisdom without faith prolongs wrong views.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c18_18']	今有信故破邪見，有解故破無明，則二法相資也。	今有信故破邪見，有解故破無明，則二法相資也。	007	Now, because there is faith, wrong views are destroyed, and because there is understanding, ignorance is destroyed. Thus, the two dharmas support each other.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c19_12']	但此義難明，今更以四句釋之。	但此義難明，今更以四句釋之。	007	However, this meaning is difficult to understand. I will now explain it further using four statements.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c20_17']	一、信而不解，雖復虛心信受而未能解，謂鈍根正見人也。	一、信而不解，雖復虛心信受而未能解，謂鈍根正見人也。	007	First, believing but not understanding. Although one has a sincere mind and accepts in faith, one is still unable to understand. This refers to those with dull faculties and right views.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c21_14']	二者、解而不信，謂利根邪見人也。	二者、解而不信，謂利根邪見人也。	007	Second, understanding but not believing. This refers to those with sharp faculties and wrong views.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c22_14']	三、亦信亦解，謂正見利根人也，即四大聲聞也。	三、亦信亦解，謂正見利根人也，即四大聲聞也。	007	Third, both believing and understanding. This refers to those with right views and sharp faculties, namely the four great disciples.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c23_9']	四、不信不解，謂鈍根邪見人也。	四、不信不解，謂鈍根邪見人也。	007	Fourth, neither believing nor understanding. This refers to those with dull faculties and wrong views.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c24_1']	次、合釋信解者，略有二義：	次、合釋信解者，略有二義：	007	Next, the combined explanation of faith and understanding has two main points:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c24_9']	一者、上有所對；	一者、上有所對；	007	First, there is something above to which it corresponds;
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c24_16']	二、下有所形。	二、下有所形。	007	Second, there is something below to which it is compared.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c25_6']	上有所對者，解有二種：	上有所對者，解有二種：	007	Those who have something to rely on means there are two kinds of understanding:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c25_12']	一者、見解；	一者、見解；	007	First, understanding through insight;
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c25_18']	二者、信解。	二者、信解。	007	Second, understanding through faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c27_18']	憑師義少見理情多，如諸菩薩，故〈譬喻品〉云「若有菩薩於是眾中能一心聽諸佛實法」，是名見解；	憑師義少見理情多，如諸菩薩，故〈譬喻品〉云「若有菩薩於是眾中能一心聽諸佛實法」，是名見解；	007	Relying on the teacher's meaning, one's insight into the principle is small, but one's emotional understanding is great, like the bodhisattvas. Therefore, the Parable Chapter says, If there are bodhisattvas in this assembly who can listen single-mindedly to the true Dharma of the buddhas, this is called understanding through insight;
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0542c29_16']	若憑師義多見理情少，故前文云「其餘聲聞信佛語故得入此經非己智分」則是信解。	若憑師義多見理情少，故前文云「其餘聲聞信佛語故得入此經非己智分」則是信解。	007	If one relies on the teacher's meaning a lot but one's insight into the principle is small, therefore the previous text says, The other śrāvakas enter this sūtra because they believe the Buddha's words, not because of their own wisdom, this is understanding through faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a01_14']	今對於菩薩見解，故目聲聞為信解也。	今對於菩薩見解，故目聲聞為信解也。	007	Now, in contrast to the bodhisattvas' understanding through insight, the śrāvakas are called those who understand through faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a03_18']	二、下有所形者，信是決定為義，雖因佛得解，解心堅明謂理必爾，不同凡夫悠悠之解，故云信解。	二、下有所形者，信是決定為義，雖因佛得解，解心堅明謂理必爾，不同凡夫悠悠之解，故云信解。	007	Second, those who have something below means faith has the meaning of being determined. Although one gains understanding through the Buddha, the resolute and bright mind of understanding thinks that the principle must be so, unlike the vague understanding of ordinary people, therefore it is called understanding through faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a05_13']	三、出體門者，依《阿毘曇》，信解有二體，信是善大地中信數，解是通大地中慧數。	三、出體門者，依《阿毘曇》，信解有二體，信是善大地中信數，解是通大地中慧數。	007	Third, in terms of revealing the essence, according to the Abhidharma, faith and understanding have two essences. Faith is the number of faith among the good universal mental factors, and understanding is the number of wisdom among the universal mental factors.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a07_4']	依《成實論》，信之與解並以心為體，然心上有信解之用，故義說為二。	依《成實論》，信之與解並以心為體，然心上有信解之用，故義說為二。	007	According to the Satyasiddhi Śāstra, both faith and understanding take the mind as their essence. However, there is the function of faith and understanding on the mind, so they are explained as two in meaning.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a08_20']	今明若見有心與數異體及以一體，皆是一異執見，非信解體，後門當具釋之。	今明若見有心與數異體及以一體，皆是一異執見，非信解體，後門當具釋之。	007	Now, if one understands that there is a difference in essence between the mind and the mental factors, or that they are the same, both are views of oneness and difference, not the essence of faith and understanding. This will be fully explained in a later section.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a10_8']	第四、信解相門者，舊云信解義多不出四句，謂權、實、有、無。	第四、信解相門者，舊云信解義多不出四句，謂權、實、有、無。	007	Fourth, in terms of the characteristics of faith and understanding, the old teachings say that the meaning of faith and understanding is not beyond four statements, namely, provisional, real, existence, and non-existence.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a11_6']	以三乘為權、一乘為實，道理唯一、無有三乘。	以三乘為權、一乘為實，道理唯一、無有三乘。	007	Taking the three vehicles as provisional and the one vehicle as real, the principle is only one, there are not three vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a12_3']	今明蓋是一往封執言，未是虛心妙悟。	今明蓋是一往封執言，未是虛心妙悟。	007	Now, it is said that this is a one-sided attachment to words, not yet the wondrous enlightenment of an empty mind.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a13_13']	若必執一乘是實、三乘為權，捨三而取一者，還是取捨有所得心耳。	若必執一乘是實、三乘為權，捨三而取一者，還是取捨有所得心耳。	007	If one insists that the One Vehicle is real and the Three Vehicles are provisional, and abandons the Three to take the One, this is still the mind of grasping and rejecting that obtains something.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a14_17']	《涅槃經》云「有所得者名為二乘」，猶未領悟何名信解？	《涅槃經》云「有所得者名為二乘」，猶未領悟何名信解？	007	The Nirvana Sutra says, One who obtains something is called a Two Vehicle practitioner, and still does not understand what is meant by faith and understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a16_4']	又若有所得則無道無果，下文何得云「我今得道得果」耶？	又若有所得則無道無果，下文何得云「我今得道得果」耶？	007	Moreover, if there is obtaining, then there is no path and no fruit. How can the text below say, I now obtain the path and obtain the fruit?
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a21_1']	又若言三是定無、謂一為實有，猶是有無二見，如〈方便品〉云「若有若無等具足六十二」，既具諸見即便有愛見，愛見即是煩惱，煩惱故業，業故受苦，如此之人如服甘露還成毒藥，是即舊病不除新惑更起，故非信解相。	又若言三是定無、謂一為實有，猶是有無二見，如〈方便品〉云「若有若無等具足六十二」，既具諸見即便有愛見，愛見即是煩惱，煩惱故業，業故受苦，如此之人如服甘露還成毒藥，是即舊病不除新惑更起，故非信解相。	007	Moreover, if it is said that the Three definitely do not exist and the One is truly existent, this is still the two views of existence and non-existence. As the chapter on skillful means says, If there is or is not, it is replete with sixty-two, since one is replete with various views, one then has the views of love and self. The views of love and self are precisely afflictions. Because of afflictions, there is karma. Because of karma, one experiences suffering. Such a person, like taking nectar, turns it into poison. This is not eliminating old illnesses but rather giving rise to new delusions. Therefore, this is not the characteristic of faith and understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a21_13']	今言信解者，可尋經本宗。	今言信解者，可尋經本宗。	007	Now, as for speaking of faith and understanding, one can seek it in the fundamental purport of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a22_14']	〈方便品〉云「諸法從本來常自寂滅相」，何一何三？	〈方便品〉云「諸法從本來常自寂滅相」，何一何三？	007	The chapter on skillful means says, All dharmas from the beginning are always characterized by quiescent extinction, how can there be one or three?
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a22_20']	亦非權非實。	亦非權非實。	007	It is also neither provisional nor real.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a27_8']	但倒情既重不可頓階，故方便誘引漸令開悟，故前說五戒十善以止三途之惡，次說三乘之聖令捨三界之凡，乃至欲息三乘之麁故明一乘為妙，如此皆是對治悉檀，以榍出榍用輕倒除重倒耳。	但倒情既重不可頓階，故方便誘引漸令開悟，故前說五戒十善以止三途之惡，次說三乘之聖令捨三界之凡，乃至欲息三乘之麁故明一乘為妙，如此皆是對治悉檀，以榍出榍用輕倒除重倒耳。	007	But since inverted emotions are already heavy, one cannot suddenly reach [the truth]. Therefore, skillful means are used to guide and gradually cause enlightenment. Therefore, the five precepts and ten wholesome [deeds] are taught first to stop the evils of the three evil paths. Next, the three vehicles' sages are taught to abandon the common [attainments] of the three realms. Even to stop the coarseness of the three vehicles, the wondrous one vehicle is taught. All of this is the siddhanta of counteracting [delusions], using a wedge to remove a wedge, using a light inversion to remove a heavy inversion.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543a29_3']	《智度論》云「譬如執事比丘舉手唱言眾皆寂靜，是為以聲遮聲非求聲也」。	《智度論》云「譬如執事比丘舉手唱言眾皆寂靜，是為以聲遮聲非求聲也」。	007	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says, It is like an attendant monk raising his hand and shouting, 'All be silent.' This is using sound to stop sound, not seeking sound.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b01_3']	說善止惡非留於善，乃至說一除三寧存於一？	說善止惡非留於善，乃至說一除三寧存於一？	007	Teaching goodness to stop evil is not to remain in goodness. Even teaching one to remove three, how can one remain in one?
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b02_4']	若能三一兩捨、權實並除，心無所依，乃名信解。	若能三一兩捨、權實並除，心無所依，乃名信解。	007	If one can abandon both three and one, and remove both provisional and real, with no reliance in the mind, this is called faith and understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b03_12']	故〈方便品〉云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著」，即其證也。	故〈方便品〉云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著」，即其證也。	007	Therefore, the chapter on skillful means says, I use countless skillful means to guide sentient beings to be free from all attachments, which is the evidence.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b06_1']	第五、明信解位者，聲聞迴小入大，始得入菩薩十信之位，故前文云「汝舍利弗以信力故得入此經」，即其證也。	第五、明信解位者，聲聞迴小入大，始得入菩薩十信之位，故前文云「汝舍利弗以信力故得入此經」，即其證也。	007	Fifth, clarifying the stage of faith and understanding. The śrāvakas turn from the small to enter the great, and only then can they enter the stage of the ten faiths of the bodhisattva. Therefore, the previous text says, You, Śāriputra, can enter this sūtra through the power of faith, which is the evidence.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b06_8']	又真諦三藏云：	又真諦三藏云：	007	Moreover, Paramārtha Tripiṭaka says:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b06_20']	「十七地論文亦作此判」。	「十七地論文亦作此判」。	007	The treatise on the seventeen stages also makes this distinction.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b08_10']	又理數應爾，學小乘猶未信大，今破小執而信大者，則知始學十信也。	又理數應爾，學小乘猶未信大，今破小執而信大者，則知始學十信也。	007	Moreover, it should be so in principle. Those who study the Lesser Vehicle still do not believe in the Great. Now, those who break the attachments of the Lesser Vehicle and believe in the Great, then know that they are just beginning to study the ten faiths.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b08_12']	問：	問：	007	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b09_19']	聲聞迴小入大得入十信位者，為入十信初心，為十信滿足耶？	聲聞迴小入大得入十信位者，為入十信初心，為十信滿足耶？	007	For those śrāvakas who turn from the Lesser Vehicle to enter the Great and enter the stage of the ten faiths, do they enter the initial mind of the ten faiths, or do they fulfill the ten faiths?
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b10_1']	答：	答：	007	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0543b10_8']	但入十信初心。	但入十信初心。	007	They only enter the initial mind of the ten faiths.

Moreover, it is precisely because of understanding and realization that one recognizes the Buddha's kindness, so praising the Buddha's deep kindness serves to confirm one's understanding and realization.

Now, following the clinging to the small without seeking the great, guarding the finger and forgetting the moon, this is a confusion regarding the small teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544b07_4']	二者、昔親聞大法令其捨小悟大，而遂樂小不欣於大，復是迷於大法。	二者、昔親聞大法令其捨小悟大，而遂樂小不欣於大，復是迷於大法。	007	Second, in the past, one personally heard the great Dharma to make one abandon the small and realize the great, yet one still delighted in the small and did not rejoice in the great, which is also a confusion regarding the great Dharma.

Now, using parables to extensively describe immeasurable events and the beginning and end of the Dharma gate, only then can the feelings of delusion and enlightenment and the praise of the Buddha's merits be revealed.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544c17_20']	「以明斯義」者，譬文雖長但明得失義。	「以明斯義」者，譬文雖長但明得失義。	007	To clarify this meaning means that although the parable text is long, it only clarifies the meaning of gain and loss.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544c18_16']	初二章為失，後章為得，設譬明此二義。	初二章為失，後章為得，設譬明此二義。	007	The first two chapters are about loss, and the last chapter is about gain. The parable is set up to illustrate these two meanings.

['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544c19_18']	今以三門釋譬喻義：	今以三門釋譬喻義：	007	Now, the meaning of the parable is explained in three aspects:

['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544c20_7']	二、少多門；	二、少多門；	007	Second, the aspect of few and many;
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544c20_13']	三、領解門。	三、領解門。	007	Third, the aspect of understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544c23_4']	來意門者，依《法華論》說火宅譬破於凡夫，明窮子譬斥二乘人執，所以前破凡夫次須斥二乘者，示次第法門破病階漸也。	來意門者，依《法華論》說火宅譬破於凡夫，明窮子譬斥二乘人執，所以前破凡夫次須斥二乘者，示次第法門破病階漸也。	007	As for the meaning of the chapter, the Fahua Lun says that the burning house parable refutes ordinary beings, and the parable of the poor son rebukes the attachment of the two vehicles. The reason for first refuting ordinary beings and then rebuking the two vehicles is to show the gradual stages of the Dharma gate for destroying illnesses.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0544c28_9']	聲聞人謂三乘所得涅槃法同、三乘並是、三無學人亦無異，故今明二乘所得法如彼草庵，如來所得法猶如大宅，二乘之人猶如窮子，如來之人如大富長者，是故迦葉自說大小具明優劣，令諸學小乘人捨小入大，故說此譬喻也。	聲聞人謂三乘所得涅槃法同、三乘並是、三無學人亦無異，故今明二乘所得法如彼草庵，如來所得法猶如大宅，二乘之人猶如窮子，如來之人如大富長者，是故迦葉自說大小具明優劣，令諸學小乘人捨小入大，故說此譬喻也。	007	The śrāvakas think that the nirvāṇa attained by the three vehicles is the same, and that the three vehicles are all correct, and that the three types of arhats are also no different. Therefore, it is now explained that the Dharma attained by the two vehicles is like a grass hut, and the Dharma attained by the Tathāgata is like a great mansion. The people of the two vehicles are like the poor son, and the people of the Tathāgata are like the great wealthy elder. Therefore, Kāśyapa himself explains the superiority and inferiority of the great and small, causing those who study the small vehicle to abandon the small and enter the great. Therefore, this parable is told.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0545a01_1']	二者、令諸菩薩知大乘尊勝小乘鄙劣，決定住大不退取小，故說此譬。	二者、令諸菩薩知大乘尊勝小乘鄙劣，決定住大不退取小，故說此譬。	007	Second, it causes the bodhisattvas to know that the great vehicle is superior and the small vehicle is inferior, and to decisively abide in the great without regressing to take the small. Therefore, this parable is told.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0545a02_20']	又令稟佛教人具識釋迦一化始終法門，知權實、前後、淺深、顯密等教，故說此喻也。	又令稟佛教人具識釋迦一化始終法門，知權實、前後、淺深、顯密等教，故說此喻也。	007	It also enables those who receive the Buddha's teachings to fully understand the Dharma gates of Śākyamuni's teaching from beginning to end, knowing the provisional and real, the sequence of events, the shallow and profound, the exoteric and esoteric teachings, and so this parable is told.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0545a03_20']	第二、定譬少多門者，釋此喻不同，今宜開為十：	第二、定譬少多門者，釋此喻不同，今宜開為十：	007	Second, the gate of determining the few and many parables is explained differently. Now it should be opened into ten:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0545a07_12']	一、初為父子喻，二、中途相失喻，三、子漸還鄉喻，四、父子相見喻，五、喚子不得喻，六、冷水灑面喻，七、誘引還家喻，八、付財密化喻，九、陶練小心喻，十、委囑家業喻。	一、初為父子喻，二、中途相失喻，三、子漸還鄉喻，四、父子相見喻，五、喚子不得喻，六、冷水灑面喻，七、誘引還家喻，八、付財密化喻，九、陶練小心喻，十、委囑家業喻。	007	First, the parable of being father and son; second, the parable of losing each other on the way; third, the parable of the son gradually returning to his hometown; fourth, the parable of the father and son seeing each other; fifth, the parable of not being able to call the son; sixth, the parable of sprinkling cold water on the face; seventh, the parable of enticing him to return home; eighth, the parable of entrusting wealth and secretly transforming; ninth, the parable of training the small mind; tenth, the parable of entrusting the family business.

Since the child is common to both large and small, the preface separately mentions being young and ignorant. Accepting the teaching begins like this, so it is called young.

['ZH_T34_1721_007:0552a22_11']	聲聞煩惱清淨，人則信受，故命聲聞。	聲聞煩惱清淨，人則信受，故命聲聞。	007	The afflictions of the śrāvakas are pure, and people then believe and accept it, thus the śrāvakas are ordered.

If they command the śrāvakas, then there is the meaning of reaching down to the inferior, and therefore they command the expounding.

Since the family business is not different, it is known that the principle of the Great Vehicle is no different. However, the two vehicles were sitting in the Prajñāpāramitā, and the great capacity was not yet mature, so they could not speak of this child.

['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556b20_7']	一、約大小乘明內外，大乘具滅三界內外，小乘但滅三界內，故稱內滅。	一、約大小乘明內外，大乘具滅三界內外，小乘但滅三界內，故稱內滅。	007	First, in terms of the great and small vehicles, the great vehicle completely extinguishes both within and outside the three realms, while the small vehicle only extinguishes within the three realms, thus it is called internal extinction.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556b21_17']	二者、菩薩並濟眾生內外俱滅，二乘但滅自惑不滅他惑，故稱內滅。	二者、菩薩並濟眾生內外俱滅，二乘但滅自惑不滅他惑，故稱內滅。	007	Second, bodhisattvas save sentient beings both internally and externally, while the two vehicles only extinguish their own delusions and not the delusions of others, thus it is called internal extinction.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556b24_12']	三者、約餘無餘明內外滅，結業既亡則未來生盡，入無餘時於外山河日月亦隨分得滅，今住有餘未得無餘，故云內滅也。	三者、約餘無餘明內外滅，結業既亡則未來生盡，入無餘時於外山河日月亦隨分得滅，今住有餘未得無餘，故云內滅也。	007	Third, in terms of the remaining and non-remaining, it clarifies the internal and external cessation. When karmic bonds are gone, future births end. When entering the non-remaining, externally the mountains, rivers, sun, and moon also cease accordingly. Now abiding in the remaining, not yet attaining the non-remaining, therefore it says internal cessation.

The Ābhidharma understands the emptiness of persons and only attains the shallow, while the Satyasiddhi Śāstra understands the emptiness of dharmas and then attains the deep.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c07_20']	問：	問：	007	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c08_12']	《成論》亦辨法空，與大乘何異？	《成論》亦辨法空，與大乘何異？	007	The Satyasiddhi Śāstra also clarifies the emptiness of dharmas, how is it different from the Great Vehicle?
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c08_14']	答：	答：	007	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c08_19']	略明四異：	略明四異：	007	Briefly explaining four differences:
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c10_9']	一者、大乘明人法本性空，小乘明折法空，故大乘是真空、小乘非真空。	一者、大乘明人法本性空，小乘明折法空，故大乘是真空、小乘非真空。	007	First, the Great Vehicle clarifies the inherent emptiness of persons and dharmas, while the Lesser Vehicle clarifies the emptiness of analyzed dharmas. Therefore, the Great Vehicle is true emptiness, while the Lesser Vehicle is not true emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c13_1']	故〈方便品〉云，小乘涅槃非是真滅，諸法從本來常自寂滅相，大乘涅槃方是真滅，滅諦即空，滅既有真偽，空亦然也。	故〈方便品〉云，小乘涅槃非是真滅，諸法從本來常自寂滅相，大乘涅槃方是真滅，滅諦即空，滅既有真偽，空亦然也。	007	Therefore, the chapter on skillful means says that the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle is not true cessation. All dharmas from the beginning are always in a state of quiescent extinction. The nirvana of the Great Vehicle is the true cessation. The truth of cessation is emptiness. Since cessation has true and false, emptiness is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c14_14']	二者、小乘但明三界內人法空，空義即短，大乘明三界內外皆空，空義即長。	二者、小乘但明三界內人法空，空義即短，大乘明三界內外皆空，空義即長。	007	Second, the Lesser Vehicle only clarifies the emptiness of dharmas and persons within the three realms. The meaning of emptiness is short. The Great Vehicle clarifies the emptiness of both within and outside the three realms. The meaning of emptiness is long.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c17_13']	三者、小乘人但見於空不見不空，大乘人具見空與不空故名中道，以空無諸累不可言有，有於眾德不可言無，非有非無即中道。	三者、小乘人但見於空不見不空，大乘人具見空與不空故名中道，以空無諸累不可言有，有於眾德不可言無，非有非無即中道。	007	Third, the practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle only see emptiness and do not see non-emptiness. The practitioners of the Great Vehicle fully see both emptiness and non-emptiness, and therefore it is called the Middle Way. Emptiness is free from all afflictions and cannot be said to exist. It has many virtues and cannot be said to be nonexistent. Neither existence nor nonexistence is the Middle Way.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c19_4']	四者、小乘人入空則失有，出有則失空，是故取捨行心斷常二見。	四者、小乘人入空則失有，出有則失空，是故取捨行心斷常二見。	007	Fourth, the practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle, when entering emptiness, lose existence. When leaving existence, they lose emptiness. Therefore, in their mind of practice, they grasp and abandon the two views of annihilation and permanence.
['ZH_T34_1721_007:0556c22_17']	《中論》云「若有所受法則墮於斷常，當知所受法若常若無常」，大乘人不壞假名而說實相，故即有而常空，不動真際建立諸法，即空而常有，故不墮斷常名中道觀。	《中論》云「若有所受法則墮於斷常，當知所受法若常若無常」，大乘人不壞假名而說實相，故即有而常空，不動真際建立諸法，即空而常有，故不墮斷常名中道觀。	007	The Zhonglun says, If there is something accepted, then one falls into annihilationism or eternalism. One should know that the accepted dharmas are either permanent or impermanent. The followers of the Mahayana do not destroy provisional names but speak of the true characteristics. Therefore, they are always empty while existing, and do not move from the ultimate truth to establish all dharmas. They are always existent while always empty. Therefore, they do not fall into annihilationism or eternalism and are called the contemplation of the middle way.
