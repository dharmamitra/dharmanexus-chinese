Before transmitting the subtle words, they first explain the three kinds of worldly adornments as the general introduction to the nine assemblies and the origin of the great Dharma. Therefore, the Chapter on the Adornments of the Wonderful and Sublime World-Honored Ones follows, which is like the introduction section of other sūtras.

The ocean of assemblies gives rise to thoughts and raises the topic of questions. The Tathāgata, about to respond, first manifests auspicious signs. The light from his mouth far summons the bodhisattvas to come. The light from his tuft universally illuminates and shows the Dharma teacher. Shaking the net of realms-within-realms alerts the multitude of capacities. The flowers manifested in front of the Buddha show the fruition that depends on causes. The light from the tuft emitting multitudes shows that the teachings flow from the Buddha. These are the general indications for the teachings to be given. Therefore, the Chapter on the Tathāgata's Manifestation of Signs follows.

The Buddha's eldest son is none other than Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. The light from his brow has already revealed the profound understanding of the sage's mind. Wishing to manifest the inconceivable, he first clarifies entering concentration, internally contemplating phenomena and principles, externally examining the capacities and inclinations of beings, above receiving the Buddha's empowerment, below serving as a model for beings.

Therefore, it explains the inconceivable events of the past when he was a prince, cultivating the supreme causes and purifying the ocean of lands. This is to illustrate the Dharma by means of the person, and thus the chapter on Vairocana is received.

Seventh, based on what is believed, the fruition of the environment is revealed. In order to give rise to profound faith, one must also understand the correct. Therefore, it first clarifies the correct rewards of the Tathagata's three karmas, namely body, speech, and mind. The body is general, so it is explained first. In response to beings, the body is formed, and the name is established according to the occasion, and thus the chapter on the Tathagata's names is received.

Since the body and speech have already been manifested, the mental activity is about to be revealed. The profound mind is unfathomable, yet still associated with the body to show. Therefore, the light emitted from the wheel of the foot illuminates events to warn beings. Mañjuśrī universally speaks of the light of wisdom, illuminating both events and principles to warn and cause understanding and entry. The two illuminations of body and wisdom combine into one light, causing the two awakenings to be equally perfect. Therefore, the chapter on the Light of Awakening follows.
