['ZH_T44_1846_03b:0277a04_16']	故云以對色故乃至心生滅也。	故云以對色故乃至心生滅也。	03b	Therefore, it says because it is opposed to form, up to the mind arising and ceasing.🔽Because all forms are originally the mind and there is no external form, if there is no form, there is no characteristic of space.

['ZH_T44_1846_03b:0277a08_10']	故云以一切色法乃至虛空之相也。	故云以一切色法乃至虛空之相也。	03b	Therefore it is said that all forms and even the characteristics of space.
['ZH_T44_1846_03b:0277a12_1']	所謂一切境界唯心妄起故有若心離於妄動則一切境界滅唯一真心無所不遍此謂如來廣大性智究竟之義非如虛空相故　結中二。	所謂一切境界唯心妄起故有若心離於妄動則一切境界滅唯一真心無所不遍此謂如來廣大性智究竟之義非如虛空相故　結中二。	03b	It is said that all realms are only the deluded arising of the mind. If the mind is apart from deluded movement, then all realms cease. There is only the one true mind, which is all-pervading.
