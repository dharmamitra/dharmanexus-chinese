Although there are no three kinds of grass in the Tripiṭaka, there are the two vehicles of the common and the distinct as the middle kind of grass, the stage of dry wisdom and nature as the upper kind of grass, those from the eighth person onward as the small tree, those from the eighth ground onward entering the path of the Distinct Teaching, and the original people of the Distinct Teaching as the great tree.

It is like polishing a mirror to see the reflection; when the reflection is seen, the mirror is bright. Because the more the reflection appears, the brighter the mirror, the brightness and reflection are originally non-dual. Your question is whether the Dharma benefits when the responsive benefits.

When the responsive body gains benefits, the Dharma also benefits. Does the Dharma respond to illness when the Fangzhang manifests illness?
['ZH_T33_1717_014:0916a26_3']	答意者，秖為法身本無病，能現病行利眾生，利生現病非實病，故知法應俱無病。	答意者，秖為法身本無病，能現病行利眾生，利生現病非實病，故知法應俱無病。	014	The meaning of the answer is: it is precisely because the Dharma body is originally without illness that it can manifest the practice of illness to benefit sentient beings. The manifestation of illness to benefit beings is not a real illness, so know that both the Dharma and the response are without illness.

The previous clarification of the various marvels only explains one marvel as having ten aspects.

Only then do we understand that from the past, whether wondrous or coarse, whether opened or applied, the empty fist is all real, and from this we further establish the main point of revealing enlightenment and deceiving the small, all of which can be used for the perfect.

In order to distinguish the beginning and end of oneself and others within the expounded, it fully expounds the ten wondrous to search out the great purpose of appearing in the world, leaving nothing incomplete. Therefore, one cannot fail to understand the ten great outlines of the wondrous. Therefore, the ten wondrous are grasped as the great essence of the method of contemplation.

The provisional and the extensive do not go beyond a single thought of the three thousand. The mundane is emptiness, provisional, and the middle. The principle realm and up to the benefits are all like this. Then the ten realizations of calming and contemplation form one's own practice of cause and effect. The chapter on initiating the teaching forms one's own ability to transform others. Then the two are clearly distinguished and the practice of the Lotus Sūtra is accomplished.

All dharmas are none other than the nature of mind. In the one nature, which is no-nature, the three thousand dharmas are still distinct. One should know that the form and mind in the mind are called transformations. Transformations are called creations, which refer to essence and function. This means that they are neither form nor mind, yet they are form and mind. The reason why they are only form and only mind lies precisely in this. Therefore, one should know that by simply being aware of a single thought, one can fully see oneself, others, sentient beings, buddhas, and others. Since other sentient beings and other buddhas are still the same as the mind, how could one's own mind, sentient beings, and buddhas deviate from a single thought?

All observed objects are not beyond inner and outer. Outer refers to relying on the form and mind of the environment and beings, which are emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way. Because emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way are wondrous, the substance of form and mind is utterly cut off, and there is only one true nature without emptiness, provisional existence, or the middle way. Form and mind are still distinct and open to the same true purity, without the seven kinds of beings or the differences in the purity and defilement of the lands. However, the environment and beings of the Indra net are ultimately distinct.

This means that external dharmas are entirely the nature of the mind. The nature of the mind is without external and includes all that is not pervasive. The nature of the bodies of the buddhas of the ten directions and the sentient beings of the Dharma realm is without distinction, and all are all-pervasive. Who says that form, mind, self, and others are inner and outer? This is the completion of the gate of the non-duality of form and mind.

Within this, the suchness of the realm and the three dharmas are complete. Although the nature is originally so, it relies on wisdom to give rise to cultivation. Due to cultivation illuminating the nature, and due to the nature giving rise to cultivation, when abiding in the nature, it is entirely cultivation becoming the nature. When giving rise to cultivation, it is entirely the nature becoming cultivation. The nature does not move, and cultivation is always distinct.
['ZH_T33_1717_014:0918c12_3']	脩又二種：	脩又二種：	014	Cultivation is also of two kinds:

It is possible that due to phenomena not moving the mind, it causes deluded cultivation to become accomplished. Therefore, one must for a period of time understand delusion, illuminate the nature and accomplish cultivation, see the nature and cultivate the mind, and both cultivations are extinguished.

Separation means that cultivation and nature each have three. Combination means that cultivation has two and nature has one. Cultivation has two and each has three, jointly producing the three natures. This means that although cultivation has nine, the nine are only three. In order to clarify cultivation in relation to nature, cultivation is combined into two. The two and the one nature are like water and waves. The two are also non-dual, just like waves and water.

Cultivation is accomplished from nature, and the accomplishment of the three dharmas is natural. Understanding that there is no cultivation and nature, there is only the wonderful vehicle, without any discrimination, the Dharma realm is completely bright. This is accomplished through the gate of the non-duality of internal and external.

Since the mind cause of sentient beings is already endowed with the three tracks, this cause results in the name of the three nirvanas.

Because of the thickness and thinness of delusion, the three delusions are forcefully divided, and the six identities are opened up to distinguish the shallow and deep wisdom. Therefore, it is like diligently adding to a dream, with the empty name of delusion being cut off.

Although emptiness and image are the same in meaning, emptiness is empty while the image is real. Because the image is real, it is called the originally existent principle. Because emptiness is empty, the turning of delusion should become the nature. This means that although non-duality establishes the distinction of cause and effect, duality and non-duality ultimately have the same essence from beginning to end.

Understanding that the effect comes from the cause, the cause then accomplishes the effect. Therefore, the three thousand in principle are all called ignorance, and the three thousand fruits accomplished are all called permanence and bliss. The three thousand are unchanged, with ignorance being precisely enlightenment, and the three bodies are all permanent, with essence and function being mutually inclusive.

The Dharma-nature and ignorance pervade the creation of all dharmas, which is called defilement. Ignorance and the Dharma-nature pervade the response to various conditions, which is called purity. The waves of turbid water and clear water are no different in wetness. Although clarity and turbidity are due to conditions, turbidity is originally existent. Although turbidity is originally existent, it is entirely clear. Because the principle of the two waves is inclusive, and the entire essence is function, therefore, the three thousand causes and effects are all called dependent arising.

The nature of a moment is always so, and the principle of dependent origination is one. Within the one principle, purity and defilement are distinguished. Separately, there are six defiled and four pure [realms]. Universally, all ten are either pure or defiled. Therefore, know that the defiled essence of a moment is all pure. The three thousand are not yet manifest, verifying that the essence is still deluded. Therefore, in the stage of similarity, the six faculties are universally illuminating, illuminating the ten realms, each complete and distinct.

Because of illumination, the three thousand are always complete. Because of blocking, the principle of emptiness and the middle is eternal. All day long, both are forgotten, and all day long, both are illuminated. Without moving this thought, it universally responds without bounds. According to the stimulus, the pure and defiled are both forgotten.

Still, due to emptiness and the middle, defilement is transformed into purity. Because of understanding the purity of defilement, emptiness and the middle are forgotten on their own. This is accomplished through the gate of non-duality between cause and effect.

Having already realized the non-duality of the one essence of Śākyamuni, it is precisely because of the three thousand in one thought since beginningless time. Within the three thousand, the two thousand of the aggregates of birth and death are the principle, and the one thousand of the lands belong to the phenomena. Since the principle and phenomena both abide in the one mind, how can the one mind be divided into subject and object?

This means that in the principle, the name, the contemplation, and the practice, there is already the appearance of the non-dual principle and phenomena. Therefore, the self and others, the causes and effects, mutually include each other.

Although the effect is not yet accomplished, none of them is not the wondrous realm of Śākyamuni. However, one should further understand that the essence of the Dharma of all Buddhas is neither universal nor universal, and the inherent nature of sentient beings is neither limited nor limited. From beginning to end, it does not change, and there is no obstruction between the large and small. The principle of cause and effect is the same, so how can the principle and phenomena be different?

This is precisely each and every defiled land is all lands, each and every defiled body is all bodies, the vastness and inferiority are difficult to imagine, the pure and defiled directions are endless.

The affairs of benefiting others according to one's capacity rely on the basis. The basis refers to the inherent endowment of self and others. Only when one reaches the fruition stage can one benefit others through oneself. Like the three virtues, three truths, and three thousand dharmas of the principle of reality, one's own practice is only in emptiness and the provisional, while benefiting others involves the three thousand dharmas responding to beings. The capacities of beings are immeasurable, but they do not go beyond the three thousand. Although the responses are numerous, they do not go beyond the ten realms. Each realm transforms and manifests without going beyond a single thought. Each land arises interdependently without going beyond the quiescent light.

If a single form were placed before it and it could not reflect the image, then the principle of the mirror would be limited and the events of the form would not be transmitted. If it were separated from the mirror, then this principle might exist, but there is no form that is placed before it and yet does not produce an image.

In the gate of transforming others, the three secrets are divided into three, following the different natures of things. The mind wheel examines the capacities, and the two wheels set up the transformation. The manifestation of the body and the speaking of the Dharma are never even slightly off. In the body, it is divided into true and responsive. In the Dharma, it is divided into provisional and real. If the two bodies are different, why is it said that they are the Dharma body? If the two teachings are contradictory, why is it said that they all lead to Buddhahood?

If one believes in cause and effect, one will know that the three mysteries have a basis, and the three karmas of the hundred realms are all empty, provisional, and middle. Therefore, it causes the effect to respond universally according to the circumstances. Each responsive form and each sound of speech is none other than the hundred realms, with the three karmas complete. Transformation again creates transformation, which can be called this.

The provisional and real are merged in the hundred realms in a single thought, and cannot be distinguished. It is always so naturally. Only when reaching the fruit does it accord with the original single principle that is neither provisional nor real, yet provisional and real. This is the same as the previous gate of the wheel of mind being sovereign, causing the mind and mouth to respond to the provisional and real capacities, and the three karmas in a single thought not contradicting the provisional and real.

Thus, the ten wondrous [aspects] from beginning to end have one principle. Just as the realm originally possesses the three, relying on principle to give rise to understanding is called wisdom. Wisdom and understanding guide practice, and practice and understanding accord with principle. The three dharmas correspond, not different yet different, and provisionally establish shallow and deep, setting up stages to distinguish confusion. The three dharmas are just realizing those three principles.

Since the three dharmas are one thought, the three thousand are emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle. Since they are accomplished, they have function. If one understands one thought, the Dharma of all Buddhas in the ten directions and three times is not distant in terms of the original and traces. Therefore, the ten approaches are restated, allowing the practice and contemplation to be recognized. Since the main title is like this, looking at the individual to form the general accords with the text that can be known.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
