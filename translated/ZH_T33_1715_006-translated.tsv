['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637a14_17']	第二「強牽將還」正領誡教擬宜，即火宅中「如所思惟具告諸子」，明于時小機與大教不相從，故言強牽也。	第二「強牽將還」正領誡教擬宜，即火宅中「如所思惟具告諸子」，明于時小機與大教不相從，故言強牽也。	The second forcefully dragging him back directly understands the admonitions and teachings being appropriate, which is the fire-house saying as I have contemplated, I will fully inform the children, clarifying that at that time the small capacities did not accord with the Great Vehicle teachings, thus it is said to be forcefully dragging.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637a19_12']	第二「于時窮子自念無罪」下是領誡無機，就中亦有二，即是領譬說兩段，第一言「于時窮子自念無罪而被囚執此必定死」，此先領無大機，即是火宅中第二正明無大機「不肯信受不驚不畏了無出意」下是也。	第二「于時窮子自念無罪」下是領誡無機，就中亦有二，即是領譬說兩段，第一言「于時窮子自念無罪而被囚執此必定死」，此先領無大機，即是火宅中第二正明無大機「不肯信受不驚不畏了無出意」下是也。	The second part, from At that time the impoverished son thought to himself, 'I have committed no crime' and so on, is about not understanding the admonition. It also has two parts, corresponding to the two sections of the parable. The first says, At that time the impoverished son thought to himself, 'I have committed no crime, yet I have been imprisoned and will certainly die.' This first corresponds to the lack of a great capacity, which is the second part of the Fire-house parable that clearly shows the lack of a great capacity, 'They were unwilling to believe and accept it, were not alarmed or afraid, and had no intention of leaving.'
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637a20_18']	我既無有大機汝強用誡教逼我，或起誹謗斷善根慧命也。	我既無有大機汝強用誡教逼我，或起誹謗斷善根慧命也。	Since I have no great capacity, you are forcefully using admonitions and teachings to pressure me, which may cause me to give rise to slander and cut off the wisdom-life of good roots.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637a23_14']	「轉更惶怖悶絕躄地」此是第二追領有小機，即是火宅中第一有人天小機，「父雖憐愍善言誘喻，而諸子等樂著嬉戲」也。	「轉更惶怖悶絕躄地」此是第二追領有小機，即是火宅中第一有人天小機，「父雖憐愍善言誘喻，而諸子等樂著嬉戲」也。	'He became even more frightened, confused, and collapsed on the ground.' This is the second part, which corresponds to the existence of a small capacity, which is the first part of the Fire-house parable about the small capacities of humans and gods, 'Although the father pitied them and used kind words to persuade them, the children were attached to their play and did not listen.'
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637a24_7']	小機不堪受大教，如躄地也。	小機不堪受大教，如躄地也。	A small capacity is unable to accept the great teaching, like collapsing on the ground.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b01_7']	就此息化中亦有二，第一思惟欲放捨兒，內合欲息化；	就此息化中亦有二，第一思惟欲放捨兒，內合欲息化；	In this cessation of teaching, there are also two parts. The first is thinking of wanting to abandon the child, which internally corresponds to wanting to cease teaching;

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b07_8']	今先明有小，「父遙」者，小機望大教相去殊遠，故言遙也。	今先明有小，「父遙」者，小機望大教相去殊遠，故言遙也。	Now, first clarifying the existence of the small, the father saw from afar means that the small capacity is far away from the great teaching, so it is said to be seen from afar.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b10_10']	將教作使于時欲息化，如「而語使言不須此人勿強將來」，人天機如面，人天等教如冷水，人天等教稱會根性，故言「灑面令醒悟」也。	將教作使于時欲息化，如「而語使言不須此人勿強將來」，人天機如面，人天等教如冷水，人天等教稱會根性，故言「灑面令醒悟」也。	When the teaching is about to cease the transformation, it is like saying Do not need this person, do not force him to come, the human and heavenly capacities are like the face, the human and heavenly teachings are like cold water, the human and heavenly teachings accord with the capacities, so it is said Sprinkle on the face to make him come to his senses.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b11_16']	「莫復與語」者，此明無大機，由無大機，故勿復與語無大機也。	「莫復與語」者，此明無大機，由無大機，故勿復與語無大機也。	Do not speak to him again means there is no great capacity. Because there is no great capacity, do not speak to him again, meaning there is no great capacity.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b13_14']	只由有小無大，故息化便成兩段：	只由有小無大，故息化便成兩段：	It is precisely because there is the small but not the great that the transformation ceases, thus forming two sections:
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b14_19']	「志意下劣」者，此即是有小，此即釋上「冷水灑面」句；	「志意下劣」者，此即是有小，此即釋上「冷水灑面」句；	With a lowly attitude means this is having the small, this explains the above phrase sprinkle water on the face;

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b19_3']	審知是昔日二萬億佛大乘所化之子，只自不語諸菩薩道，是失大乘解之子，故言「不語他人」也。	審知是昔日二萬億佛大乘所化之子，只自不語諸菩薩道，是失大乘解之子，故言「不語他人」也。	Clearly knowing that he is the son transformed by the Mahayana of the Buddhas of the past twenty koṭīs of nayutas, he himself does not speak of the bodhisattva path, this is the son who has lost the understanding of the Mahayana, therefore it says do not speak to others.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b20_8']	「使者語之」下，領息化中本有二段，此下是第二正明息化。	「使者語之」下，領息化中本有二段，此下是第二正明息化。	The messenger said to him below, in the understanding of the cessation of transformation there were originally two sections, this below is the second正明息化.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b25_15']	即是火宅中勸教息化言「戀著戲處或當墮落」等，誡教息化言「但東西走戲視父而已」，即是〈方便品〉中「我寧不說法疾入於涅槃」義也。	即是火宅中勸教息化言「戀著戲處或當墮落」等，誡教息化言「但東西走戲視父而已」，即是〈方便品〉中「我寧不說法疾入於涅槃」義也。	This is the same as the passage in the Burning House chapter that exhorts to stop the teaching and transform, saying They will cling to the place of play and may fall down, and the passage that admonishes to stop the teaching and transform, saying They will only run around and play, looking at their father. This is the same as the meaning in the Skillful Means chapter, I would rather not teach the Dharma and quickly enter nirvana.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b26_18']	第二言「窮子歡喜」，此明息化得宜，含有二義故喜。	第二言「窮子歡喜」，此明息化得宜，含有二義故喜。	The second says The poor son was delighted, which clarifies that stopping the teaching and transforming was appropriate, and contains two meanings, therefore he was delighted.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637b29_16']	二「從地而起」者，向被大乘教擬宜之時如躄地，今既不復被大乘教所擬宜，故如從地而起。	二「從地而起」者，向被大乘教擬宜之時如躄地，今既不復被大乘教所擬宜，故如從地而起。	Second, rising from the ground means that when he was previously targeted by the Mahayana teaching, it was like falling to the ground. Now that he is no longer targeted by the Mahayana teaching, it is like rising from the ground.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c02_13']	人天教如貧里，其中人天果報如衣食，則是人天小教稱會人天小機，故喜也。	人天教如貧里，其中人天果報如衣食，則是人天小教稱會人天小機，故喜也。	The teaching of humans and gods is like a poor village, and the rewards of humans and gods within it are like clothing and food. This is the small teaching of humans and gods that accords with the small capacity of humans and gods, therefore he was delighted.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c04_16']	「爾時長者將欲誘引其子」自此下是第四喚子得譬，此則是第四譬及第五譬共領上第四譬也。	「爾時長者將欲誘引其子」自此下是第四喚子得譬，此則是第四譬及第五譬共領上第四譬也。	At that time the elder, wishing to lure his son... From here is the fourth section on calling the sons and obtaining them. This corresponds to the fourth and fifth parables in the above fourth section.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c07_17']	今此第四譬領上第四譬中前兩段擬宜與見三乘機，就此譬中自有二段，第一明父喚子，第二從「既已得之」以下明見子受喚也。	今此第四譬領上第四譬中前兩段擬宜與見三乘機，就此譬中自有二段，第一明父喚子，第二從「既已得之」以下明見子受喚也。	Now this fourth section corresponds to the first two parts in the above fourth section, which are the expedient means of the three vehicles and the opportunity seen in the three vehicles. In this parable there are two parts. The first clarifies the father calling his sons, and the second, from having already obtained it, clarifies seeing the sons accepting the call.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c09_12']	內合為論，先領佛用三乘教擬宜，後見三乘人能受，就此兩段中各有四階。	內合為論，先領佛用三乘教擬宜，後見三乘人能受，就此兩段中各有四階。	In terms of the inner meaning, it first corresponds to the Buddha's expedient means using the teachings of the three vehicles, and later sees the people of the three vehicles able to accept them. In these two parts there are four levels each.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c12_9']	第一父喚子中有四階者，且就外譬為語，第一先覓可使之人，第二即得可使之人，第三與使之人語，第四使人受命喚之也。	第一父喚子中有四階者，且就外譬為語，第一先覓可使之人，第二即得可使之人，第三與使之人語，第四使人受命喚之也。	The first, the father calling his sons, has four levels. First, using the outer parable to speak, first seeking out a suitable person to send; second, immediately obtaining a suitable person to send; third, speaking with the person to be sent; fourth, the messenger accepting the order and calling out.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c15_5']	今言「長者將欲誘引其子而設方便」者，此是第一覓可使之人，內合明如來覓三乘教，此則領火宅中「我今當設方便」也。	今言「長者將欲誘引其子而設方便」者，此是第一覓可使之人，內合明如來覓三乘教，此則領火宅中「我今當設方便」也。	Now, the text says the elder, wanting to lure his son, devised a plan, this is the first seeking of a suitable messenger, internally clarifying the Tathāgata seeking the teachings of the Three Vehicles, this then corresponds to the I will now devise a plan in the Burning House.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c18_7']	「密遣二人形色憔悴無威德者」，此是第二得可使之人，內合明如來得二乘教在法身之地，于時未說二乘教只是法身地擬宜，故言密遣。	「密遣二人形色憔悴無威德者」，此是第二得可使之人，內合明如來得二乘教在法身之地，于時未說二乘教只是法身地擬宜，故言密遣。	Secretly dispatching two people with haggard appearances and no dignity, this is the second obtaining of a suitable messenger, internally clarifying the Tathāgata obtaining the teachings of the Two Vehicles in the ground of the Dharma body, at that time not yet expounding the teachings of the Two Vehicles, merely intending them in the ground of the Dharma body, thus speaking of secretly dispatching.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c20_16']	「形色憔悴」者，以理來名教，若用大乘教詮大乘理，名形色暉華，今二乘教不能詮大乘因果之理，故言憔悴也。	「形色憔悴」者，以理來名教，若用大乘教詮大乘理，名形色暉華，今二乘教不能詮大乘因果之理，故言憔悴也。	Haggard appearances refers to the teachings named according to principle, if using the teachings of the Great Vehicle to expound the principle of the Great Vehicle, it is called radiant appearance, now the teachings of the Two Vehicles cannot expound the principle of the causes and effects of the Great Vehicle, thus speaking of haggardness.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c22_15']	「無威德者」，二乘教不說聲聞辟支有三十二相、八十種好、四無畏等德，故言無威德也。	「無威德者」，二乘教不說聲聞辟支有三十二相、八十種好、四無畏等德，故言無威德也。	Lacking majestic virtue means that the teachings of the Two Vehicles do not speak of the merits of the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas having the thirty-two marks, eighty minor marks, four forms of fearlessness, etc., so it says they lack majestic virtue.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c23_12']	向者言三乘方便，今何故言二乘也？	向者言三乘方便，今何故言二乘也？	Why is it said to be the Two Vehicles when it was previously said to be the expedient means of the Three Vehicles?

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c26_5']	」「汝可詣彼」此下是第三與使人語，內合明佛作二乘教方法也。	」「汝可詣彼」此下是第三與使人語，內合明佛作二乘教方法也。	You may go to him - this is the third part, speaking with the messenger, which internally clarifies the Buddha's method of teaching the Two Vehicle teachings.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c26_18']	四諦如此，十二因緣如彼也。	四諦如此，十二因緣如彼也。	The Four Truths are like this, and the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination are like that.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c28_1']	二乘教非正直化物，入大乘解義奢，故言「徐語」也。	二乘教非正直化物，入大乘解義奢，故言「徐語」也。	The teachings of the Two Vehicles are not the straightforward way of transforming beings, and entering the understanding of the Mahāyāna is difficult, so it says speak slowly to him.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0637c29_13']	「倍與汝直」者，二乘教擬宜為說二乘家盡無生智勝天等果，故倍直也。	「倍與汝直」者，二乘教擬宜為說二乘家盡無生智勝天等果，故倍直也。	Double your wages means that the teachings of the Two Vehicles are suitable for expounding the superior fruits of extinction and non-arising wisdom in the teachings of the Two Vehicles, so it is double the wages.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638a03_14']	「雇汝除糞」者，二乘人若受教之後，望見修治道斷九十八使煩惱，如雇汝除糞也。	「雇汝除糞」者，二乘人若受教之後，望見修治道斷九十八使煩惱，如雇汝除糞也。	To hire you to remove the dung means that after the two vehicles accept the teaching, they hope to see the path of cultivation eliminate the ninety-eight afflictions, like hiring you to remove the dung.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638a09_13']	此則領火宅中「令諸子等得免斯害」，亦則領〈方便品〉中「我今所得法亦應說三乘」也。	此則領火宅中「令諸子等得免斯害」，亦則領〈方便品〉中「我今所得法亦應說三乘」也。	This corresponds to the so that the children may escape this harm in the Burning House, and also corresponds to the the Dharma I have attained should also be expounded in terms of the three vehicles in the Chapter on Skillful Means.

This corresponds to the second part in the Burning House, the father knows that his children each have their own preferences, and is also the capacity for the Three Vehicle people seen in the chapter on skillful means, He further had this thought, 'I have emerged in a defiled and evil world, as taught by the Buddhas, I too will practice accordingly.'

Now, saying having already attained it, this is the first, clarifying that sentient beings have the capacity to hear it. Later, it will also be taught to give rise to the wholesome roots of the outer world, which is the meaning of each one is courageous and resolute.

Later, it is also said that they will definitely give rise to the ability to eliminate afflictions through the path of contemplation and insight above the stage of signlessness, which is the meaning of competing to run together.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638a25_6']	所以言「先取其價」者，即是三界外盡、無生智，二乘人要先標心三界外有盡、無生智，然後只修行斷煩惱，即此是取其價義也。	所以言「先取其價」者，即是三界外盡、無生智，二乘人要先標心三界外有盡、無生智，然後只修行斷煩惱，即此是取其價義也。	The reason it says first taking the wages is the knowledge of exhaustion and non-arising outside the three realms. Practitioners of the two vehicles must first set their minds on the knowledge of exhaustion and non-arising outside the three realms, and then only cultivate to eliminate afflictions. This is the meaning of taking the wages.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638a29_6']	「其父見子愍而怪之」者，此是第四階，明長者起愍傷之念，內合如來見眾生只有修行得羅漢果之機，起慈愍之心，念其取小不取大意，此是即「諍出火宅」義，亦猶在法身地也。	「其父見子愍而怪之」者，此是第四階，明長者起愍傷之念，內合如來見眾生只有修行得羅漢果之機，起慈愍之心，念其取小不取大意，此是即「諍出火宅」義，亦猶在法身地也。	The father sees his son and feels pity and wonder is the fourth stage, which clarifies the elder's arising of the thought of pity and concern. Internally corresponding, the Tathāgata sees sentient beings only having the capacity to cultivate and attain the fruit of arhatship, and gives rise to a mind of loving pity, thinking of their taking the small and not taking the great meaning. This is the meaning of dispute and exit from the burning house, and is also still in the stage of the Dharma-body.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638b13_12']	既說三乘教三人受行，即是稱可長者意也。	既說三乘教三人受行，即是稱可長者意也。	After expounding the teachings of the three vehicles, the three people accepted and practiced them, which is in accordance with the elder's intention.

Internally corresponding, it is the time when the Buddha is about to expound the teachings of the three vehicles and illuminates the capacities of the beings.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638b28_9']	所以言「他日」者，上已明見者，則是領用三乘擬宜之時見機也；	所以言「他日」者，上已明見者，則是領用三乘擬宜之時見機也；	The reason it says another day is because above it has already clarified seeing, which is the time of seeing the capacities when using the three vehicles to make a fitting analogy;

The reason he does not say in the door but says in the window is to illustrate that the Tathāgata sees sentient beings with expedient wisdom. This capacity is not the true wisdom, like a window.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638c07_3']	「遙見子身」此是第三正明見子之相，內合明如來正照小乘機，自有二，第一明有善，第二明有惡，表明純善不感聖也。	「遙見子身」此是第三正明見子之相，內合明如來正照小乘機，自有二，第一明有善，第二明有惡，表明純善不感聖也。	From afar he sees his son's body is the third, directly clarifying the appearance of seeing his son.

This corresponds to the first phrase immediately removing the necklaces, which clarifies the Tathāgata's demonstration of cultivating wisdom. Using the hand of wisdom to hold the two truths as objects, cutting off afflictions and demonstrating the same disgust with birth and death, thus it is said to appear fearful.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0638c25_14']	「語諸作人」此下是第二正教作，就此正教作中有四階，一者勸令懃作，二者明加汝價，三者讚歎作具，四者安慰作人也。	「語諸作人」此下是第二正教作，就此正教作中有四階，一者勸令懃作，二者明加汝價，三者讚歎作具，四者安慰作人也。	Speaking to the workers and below is the second, the correct teaching of work. In this correct teaching of work there are four steps: first, encouraging diligent work; second, clarifying adding to your wages; third, praising the work tools; fourth, comforting the workers.

First, it leads to the third, telling the workers, You should work diligently is the first, leading to the third exhortation in the burning house to tell the children to go and take the three carts, You should quickly come out, corresponding to the parable, it also says You should only diligently cultivate and make progress - this is the phrase.

Not only is it a direct exhortation to work, but it also adds that he will give them wages, which leads to the second above, showing the location of the three carts. Above it said There are various sheep carts, deer carts, and ox carts now outside the gate. Here, adding wages means that in the past it was only the rewards of humans and gods, but now adding wages is simply the knowledge of exhaustion and non-arising.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0639a13_19']	「老弊使人」者，本以代手足運動，明羅漢備有六通隱顯遊方，此六通不及如來神通，故言老弊也。	「老弊使人」者，本以代手足運動，明羅漢備有六通隱顯遊方，此六通不及如來神通，故言老弊也。	Old and worn-out servants originally refer to replacing hands and feet with movement, clarifying that arhats are fully endowed with the six spiritual powers and can appear and disappear while traveling in the cardinal directions. These six spiritual powers are not as good as the spiritual powers of the Tathāgata, so it is said they are old and worn-out.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0639a14_13']	此自是羅漢神通，何故言佛給？	此自是羅漢神通，何故言佛給？	This is the spiritual power of the arhats themselves, so why is it said that the Buddha provides?

Therefore, the second part, from The Tathāgata also has immeasurable, boundless, incalculable merits up to cannot be fully explained, is called explaining what has not yet been fully explained.

Although the Buddha is fully endowed with various virtues, if we collect them using expedient and real [wisdom], they do not go beyond these two paths. How can it be said that there are also immeasurable asaṃkhyeyas of merits?

This pair is combined to be the first, which correctly describes the four great śrāvakas using thirteen lines of verse to praise the Buddha's deep kindness that is difficult to repay.🔽Second, clarifying what has not been spoken of yet has two parts. The first says, The Tathāgata also has immeasurable, boundless, incalculable merits, this correctly brings up the Dharma that has not been spoken of yet.

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648a16_17']	第二從「一雲所雨」下訖「華果敷實」，名為增長譬。	第二從「一雲所雨」下訖「華果敷實」，名為增長譬。	The second, from the rain from one cloud up to flowers and fruits blossom and ripen, is called the metaphor of growth.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648a18_14']	前明受潤，後明增長，內合明眾生初始聞佛說法，皆歡喜領受，如草木稟天雨一往受潤。	前明受潤，後明增長，內合明眾生初始聞佛說法，皆歡喜領受，如草木稟天雨一往受潤。	The previous section clarified receiving nourishment, while the latter section clarifies growth. Internally, it clarifies that when sentient beings initially hear the Buddha's teachings, they all joyfully accept them, like grasses and trees receiving the heavenly rain and being nourished.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648a22_15']	後明增長者，明眾生昔日聞佛說法後相與增長善根，下合譬雖道「後生善處以道受樂」，此明報因得報果，非不有報因，但今日辨增長之義止取習因習果，明其增長之義。	後明增長者，明眾生昔日聞佛說法後相與增長善根，下合譬雖道「後生善處以道受樂」，此明報因得報果，非不有報因，但今日辨增長之義止取習因習果，明其增長之義。	The latter section on growth clarifies that after sentient beings heard the Buddha's teachings in the past, they mutually increased their wholesome roots. The following analogy, although it says later being born in a good place and experiencing happiness through the Way, clarifies that the cause of retribution obtains the fruit of retribution. It is not that there is no cause of retribution, but today's discussion of the meaning of growth only takes the cause of habit and the fruit of habit to clarify the meaning of growth.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648a23_5']	此兩譬中各有二階。	此兩譬中各有二階。	In these two analogies, each has two stages.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648a26_8']	受潤譬中有二者，第一從「卉木叢林及諸藥草」下訖「隨上中下」以下，此牒受潤之法，即是三草二木根莖枝葉者喻前所述五種人信戒定慧也。	受潤譬中有二者，第一從「卉木叢林及諸藥草」下訖「隨上中下」以下，此牒受潤之法，即是三草二木根莖枝葉者喻前所述五種人信戒定慧也。	In the analogy of receiving nourishment, there are two parts. The first, from grasses, trees, groves, and various medicinal herbs to according to the superior, middling, and inferior, clarifies the method of receiving nourishment. The grasses and trees, bushes and forests, and various medicinal herbs are metaphors for the five kinds of people's faith, precepts, concentration, and wisdom mentioned above.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648a28_13']	第二言「各有所受」此一句正明受潤之義，內合明眾生昔日聞佛說教各各受持，故言各有所受也。	第二言「各有所受」此一句正明受潤之義，內合明眾生昔日聞佛說教各各受持，故言各有所受也。	The second sentence each receives what it can directly clarifies the meaning of receiving nourishment. Internally, it clarifies that sentient beings of the past heard the Buddha's teachings and each received and upheld them, thus it says each receives what it can.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b02_11']	第二增長譬中有二階者，第一言「一雲所雨」先牒增長所由，所由者是雲雨，內合眾生所以得習善增長者，由有如來形聲。	第二增長譬中有二階者，第一言「一雲所雨」先牒增長所由，所由者是雲雨，內合眾生所以得習善增長者，由有如來形聲。	The second analogy of growth has two parts. The first sentence one cloud rains first cites the basis for growth. The basis is the cloud and rain. Internally, the reason sentient beings are able to cultivate and increase goodness is due to the presence of the Tathagata's form and sound.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b03_16']	第二言「稱其種姓」下三句正明增長，此三句亦次第相生。	第二言「稱其種姓」下三句正明增長，此三句亦次第相生。	The second sentence according to their various kinds and the following three sentences directly clarify growth. These three sentences also arise sequentially.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b05_15']	初言「稱其種性」，此先舉增長之類，喻五乘人根性各有種類而得生長，此正明增長。	初言「稱其種性」，此先舉增長之類，喻五乘人根性各有種類而得生長，此正明增長。	The first sentence according to their various kinds first raises the categories of growth. The analogy is that the five vehicles of people have their own kinds and are able to grow. This directly clarifies growth.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b07_4']	「華果敷實」此釋成增長之相，若不增長云何言有華果之實也？	「華果敷實」此釋成增長之相，若不增長云何言有華果之實也？	Flowers and fruits flourish clarifies the appearance of growth. If there is no growth, how can it be said that there are flowers and fruits?
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b08_3']	「雖一地所生」此下，是第二明不自知譬。	「雖一地所生」此下，是第二明不自知譬。	Although born from the same earth - below this is the second, clarifying the analogy of not knowing oneself.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b11_14']	三草二木終日稟乎天澤，不知增長差別之相，明四大聲聞昔日親自稟受如來三乘教，執三乘定別、迷同歸之理，而不自知三乘所行始終只是一乘同趣一果。	三草二木終日稟乎天澤，不知增長差別之相，明四大聲聞昔日親自稟受如來三乘教，執三乘定別、迷同歸之理，而不自知三乘所行始終只是一乘同趣一果。	The three grasses and two trees all day long receive the heavenly moisture, but do not know the differences in their growth, clarifying that the four great śrāvakas in the past personally received the Tathāgata's three vehicles of teaching, grasping the definite differences of the three vehicles, confused about the principle of returning to the same, and not knowing themselves that the beginning and end of the practice of the three vehicles is only one vehicle, equally heading towards one fruition.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b13_13']	又就不自知譬中亦有二階者，第一「雖一地所生一雨所潤」者，先舉不自知所由；	又就不自知譬中亦有二階者，第一「雖一地所生一雨所潤」者，先舉不自知所由；	Moreover, within the analogy of not knowing oneself, there are also two levels. The first, although born from the same earth, moistened by the same rain, first raises the reason for not knowing oneself;
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b18_2']	第二言「而諸草木各有差別」此正明不自知，雖復有差別之相，而不自知所以有此差別，內合四大聲聞昔日稟如來三乘別教各得別果，于時三乘自言彼此各異，而自不知始終同歸俱至極果也。	第二言「而諸草木各有差別」此正明不自知，雖復有差別之相，而不自知所以有此差別，內合四大聲聞昔日稟如來三乘別教各得別果，于時三乘自言彼此各異，而自不知始終同歸俱至極果也。	The second statement, yet the grasses and trees each have distinctions, clearly shows that they do not know themselves. Although they have the appearance of distinctions, they do not know why they have these distinctions. Internally, it corresponds to the four great disciples who in the past received the Tathāgata's three vehicles' separate teachings and each attained separate fruits. At that time, the three vehicles said that they were each different, but they did not know that they would ultimately return to the same and reach the ultimate fruit together.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b19_4']	「迦葉當知如來亦復如是」，自此下是第二合譬。	「迦葉當知如來亦復如是」，自此下是第二合譬。	Kāśyapa, you should know that the Tathāgata is also like this. From here on is the second part, which corresponds to the parable.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b20_11']	但上開譬中本有二，一者是稟澤增長譬，二者不自知譬。	但上開譬中本有二，一者是稟澤增長譬，二者不自知譬。	But in the original parable there were two parts: first, the parable of receiving the moisture and growing; second, the parable of not knowing oneself.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b22_13']	今此合譬中，亦有二段者，第一從「如來亦復如是」下竟「具足蒙潤各得生長」，合稟澤增長譬；	今此合譬中，亦有二段者，第一從「如來亦復如是」下竟「具足蒙潤各得生長」，合稟澤增長譬；	Now in this corresponding parable there are also two parts. The first part, from the Tathāgata is also like this to each receives the moisture and grows, corresponds to the parable of receiving the moisture and growing;

['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b27_14']	所以不六者，上開能稟譬中有二，一者本，二者末。	所以不六者，上開能稟譬中有二，一者本，二者末。	The reason it is not six is that in the original analogy of receiving, there are two: first, the root, and second, the branches.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648b28_10']	今但合末不合其本，所以成五段。	今但合末不合其本，所以成五段。	Now, it only combines the branches and does not combine the root, so it becomes five sections.

Now, first it combines the clouds, second it combines the grasses and trees, third it combines the rain, fourth it combines receiving the moisture, and fifth it combines growth.
['ZH_T33_1715_006:0648c01_12']	但上草木本是第一，今者在第二。	但上草木本是第一，今者在第二。	But the grasses and trees were originally the first, now they are in the second.

However, in the first section using the Tathagata's form to combine with the cloud, there are two steps. The first is directly using the Tathagata's form to combine, and the second is like a great cloud rising using an external analogy to illustrate the combination.
