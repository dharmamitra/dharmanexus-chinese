First, directly discerning the essence of the sūtra: This sūtra takes inconceivable true nature liberation as its essence. The meaning of true nature liberation is extensively explained as above.

If using the principle of one reality as the essence, then there is no fault of two essences.

Now it is said the nature of desire, anger, and delusion is precisely the true nature. The true nature is precisely the true aspect, an alternate name for the one true reality.

['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555a03_15']	如《大智論》說「聲聞經有三法印，無常、無我、寂滅涅槃印」，小乘經有此印，即是小乘了義經，行人稟教，能得道也；	如《大智論》說「聲聞經有三法印，無常、無我、寂滅涅槃印」，小乘經有此印，即是小乘了義經，行人稟教，能得道也；	006	As the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, The sūtras of the śrāvakas have three Dharma seals: impermanence, no-self, and nirvāṇa, which is quiescent and extinct. The sūtras of the Lesser Vehicle have these seals, and are therefore the definitive sūtras of the Lesser Vehicle. Practitioners who follow these teachings can attain the Way.

If Mahāyāna sūtras have the seal of the true characteristics of all dharmas, they are the definitive sūtras of the Great Vehicle. Those who hear them can attain the Way of the bodhisattva.
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555a08_13']	若無諸法實相印，即是不了義經，聞者多墮二邊，不能得無生忍也。	若無諸法實相印，即是不了義經，聞者多墮二邊，不能得無生忍也。	006	If they do not have the seal of the true characteristics of all dharmas, they are not definitive sūtras. Those who hear them often fall into the two extremes and cannot attain the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.

['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555a10_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	006	Why is this?
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555a12_3']	魔王亦能說種種願行，但不能說諸法實相，故《大智論》云「除諸法實相，其餘一切皆是魔事」。	魔王亦能說種種願行，但不能說諸法實相，故《大智論》云「除諸法實相，其餘一切皆是魔事」。	006	The king of demons can also speak various vows and practices, but he cannot speak the true characteristics of all dharmas. Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says: Except for the true characteristics of all dharmas, the rest are all the affairs of Māra.

['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555a15_14']	聲聞根鈍著重，故須說三法印，令厭生死苦，欣涅槃樂。	聲聞根鈍著重，故須說三法印，令厭生死苦，欣涅槃樂。	006	The faculties of śrāvakas are dull and attached, so they need to be taught the three Dharma seals to make them weary of the suffering of birth and death and yearn for the bliss of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555a17_16']	菩薩大悲根利，易悟生死即涅槃相，能不捨生死，不取涅槃，入不二法門，故佛但說諸法實相印也。	菩薩大悲根利，易悟生死即涅槃相，能不捨生死，不取涅槃，入不二法門，故佛但說諸法實相印也。	006	Bodhisattvas have the faculty of great compassion, sharp faculties, and are easily enlightened to the fact that birth and death is the characteristic of nirvāṇa. They are able to not abandon birth and death and not grasp at nirvāṇa, and enter the gate of the non-dual Dharma. Therefore, the Buddha only teaches the seal of the true characteristics of all dharmas.

['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555a27_6']	一、明簡偽顯真者，實理幽微，真偽難別，但凡夫所習，若教、若行，莫不各以為真，故尋學之徒，必須自以智力，研覈真偽。	一、明簡偽顯真者，實理幽微，真偽難別，但凡夫所習，若教、若行，莫不各以為真，故尋學之徒，必須自以智力，研覈真偽。	006	First, clarifying the distinction between false and true: the true principle is profound and subtle, and it is difficult to distinguish true from false. However, the teachings and practices that ordinary people cultivate are all considered true by themselves. Therefore, those who study must use their own wisdom to investigate and discern the true from the false.

['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555b06_3']	一、世間經書所明非實相者，世間經書所明，但為安國治家，賞善罰惡，仁、義、禮、智，誠信、孝敬，養生、養性之道，皆是愛論，乃至釋提桓因種種善論，諸梵天王說出欲論，五通之人神仙之論，亦皆是屬愛之戲論。	一、世間經書所明非實相者，世間經書所明，但為安國治家，賞善罰惡，仁、義、禮、智，誠信、孝敬，養生、養性之道，皆是愛論，乃至釋提桓因種種善論，諸梵天王說出欲論，五通之人神仙之論，亦皆是屬愛之戲論。	006	First, what is explained in worldly scriptures is not the true reality. What is explained in worldly scriptures is only for the sake of pacifying the country and governing the household, rewarding good and punishing evil, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, sincerity, faith, filial piety, respect, the way of nourishing life and nurturing nature. All of these are theories of love, up to the various good theories of Śakra Devānām-Indra, the theories of leaving desire spoken by the Brahmā kings, and the theories of the five supernormal powers and divine immortals, are all also the frivolous discourses belonging to attachment.

Non-Buddhists often give rise to views of self, extremes, and perversions. Some reckon that the spirit and the world are permanent, and this is true, the rest is false speech... up to some reckon that the spirit and the world are neither permanent nor impermanent, and this is true, the rest is false speech.

['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555b17_15']	且聲聞人厭畏生死，觀無常斷結，即身欲入涅槃，不能深求諸法實相，故不明實相也。	且聲聞人厭畏生死，觀無常斷結，即身欲入涅槃，不能深求諸法實相，故不明實相也。	006	Moreover, Śrāvaka practitioners are weary of birth and death, contemplate impermanence to sever bonds, and immediately wish to enter nirvāṇa in this body, unable to deeply seek the true reality of all dharmas, so it does not clarify the true reality.

Śrāvakas entering the Dharma nature only see the Dharma nature, like empty space with nothing;
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0555c27_17']	菩薩、諸佛入法性實相，亦見法性如虛空，能於如虛空法性中，開佛知見，圓照法界一切法也。	菩薩、諸佛入法性實相，亦見法性如虛空，能於如虛空法性中，開佛知見，圓照法界一切法也。	006	Bodhisattvas and Buddhas entering the true reality of the Dharma nature also see the Dharma nature like empty space, but they are able to open the Buddha's insight into the Dharma realm and all dharmas within the Dharma nature like empty space.

The principle of non-emptiness, the intrinsically pure mind, and the principle of the tathāgatagarbha are taken as the essence of reality.

The gate of existence refers to the three treasures teaching the arising and ceasing of conditioned causes and conditions. If one receives this teaching, one can break the sixteen views and see that the aggregates, realms, and sense bases, and all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, suffering, empty, and without self. One attains the supreme worldly dharmas and gives rise to true, undefiled wisdom.

If one receives this teaching, one can break through the delusions of biased attachment to existence and nonexistence, see the emptiness of conditioned arising, and give rise to true undefiled wisdom.

The self is not in the three times, which is neither existent nor nonexistent, which is not emptiness. This may not be definitively used.
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0557c05_16']	二、明通教四門者，即是《智度論》明「一切實，一切不實，一切亦實亦不實，一切非實非不實」，佛於此四句，廣說第一義悉檀。	二、明通教四門者，即是《智度論》明「一切實，一切不實，一切亦實亦不實，一切非實非不實」，佛於此四句，廣說第一義悉檀。	006	Second, clarifying the four approaches of the common teaching, it is the same as the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom clarifying all is real, all is unreal, all is both real and unreal, all is neither real nor unreal.

Therefore, the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings says, The Mahaprajnaparamita, the Huayan Sea, and the Emptiness all proclaim the bodhisattvas' cultivation through kalpas, but they have never proclaimed such a profound Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings.

['ZH_T38_1777_006:0562a18_11']	如《法華》說一實無作四諦，為諸聲聞開佛知見，悉受記莂，成大果實，如秋收冬藏，更無所作，即是從熟蘇出醍醐。	如《法華》說一實無作四諦，為諸聲聞開佛知見，悉受記莂，成大果實，如秋收冬藏，更無所作，即是從熟蘇出醍醐。	006	Like the Lotus Sūtra says, the one true four truths of non-action, for the sake of the śrāvakas opening the Buddha's knowledge and insight, all receiving predictions, accomplishing the great fruit, like the autumn harvest and winter storage, no longer having anything to do, which are like the ghee coming from clarified butter.
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0562a21_5']	又，《涅槃經》為諸比丘說三修佛性，一實無作四諦，為諸聲聞開決慧眼，見佛性，安置諸子祕密之藏，亦是從熟蘇出醍醐。	又，《涅槃經》為諸比丘說三修佛性，一實無作四諦，為諸聲聞開決慧眼，見佛性，安置諸子祕密之藏，亦是從熟蘇出醍醐。	006	Moreover, the Nirvana Sutra explains the three cultivations of Buddha-nature for the bhikṣus, and the true, unfabricated four truths, opening the wisdom-eye for the śrāvakas to see Buddha-nature and placing the children in the secret treasury, which is also going from mature ghee to the best ghee.
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0562a24_6']	故《無量義經》明說《大品》在《法華》前，《大智論》云「《摩訶般若》在《法華》後」，如此明五味之義，與常塗一往似同，細心比並，辨次解義，不相關也。	故《無量義經》明說《大品》在《法華》前，《大智論》云「《摩訶般若》在《法華》後」，如此明五味之義，與常塗一往似同，細心比並，辨次解義，不相關也。	006	Therefore, the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings clarifies that the teaching of the Great Vehicle was before the Lotus Sutra, and the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says that the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sutra was after the Lotus Sutra. The explanation of the meaning of the five flavors in this way is generally the same as the usual path, but when carefully compared and analyzed, the sequence and meaning are not related.

Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, It is like a person who puts poison in milk, up to ghee, which can also kill people.
['ZH_T38_1777_006:0562a29_17']	所以梁武、流支、攝山三家，此經、《大品》皆是滿字，明佛性辨常，意在此也。	所以梁武、流支、攝山三家，此經、《大品》皆是滿字，明佛性辨常，意在此也。	006	Therefore, the three families of Liang Wu, Liu Zhi, and She Shan, this sutra, and the Great Collection Sutra are all full-character teachings that clarify the Buddha-nature and discuss permanence, and the meaning is in this.
