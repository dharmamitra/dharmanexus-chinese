['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b02_14']	所言一切性者，是我等性，謂我、人、眾生、壽者、補特伽羅、摩拏嚩迦等性，而彼等性非菩提心。	所言一切性者，是我等性，謂我、人、眾生、壽者、補特伽羅、摩拏嚩迦等性，而彼等性非菩提心。	001	As for what is called all natures, it refers to the natures of self, etc., namely, the natures of self, person, sentient being, living being, pudgala, mānava, etc., but those natures are not the mind of enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b02_19']	於意云何？	於意云何？	001	What do you think?
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b04_8']	謂彼我等而於自性離一切相中而生我見，從我見生一切煩惱；	謂彼我等而於自性離一切相中而生我見，從我見生一切煩惱；	001	That is to say, they and others give rise to the view of self within the nature that is free from all characteristics, and from the view of self arises all afflictions;
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b04_14']	此不生彼心。	此不生彼心。	001	this does not give rise to that mind.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b06_2']	或言蘊處界等亦離取捨，謂蘊處界等性真實理不可得故。	或言蘊處界等亦離取捨，謂蘊處界等性真實理不可得故。	001	Or it is said that the aggregates, sense bases, and elements are also free from grasping and abandoning, because the true principle of the nature of the aggregates, sense bases, and elements cannot be attained.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b06_10']	云何色相等無實？	云何色相等無實？	001	How are the characteristics of form and so forth unreal?
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b07_1']	謂色蘊四大合成故。	謂色蘊四大合成故。	001	That is to say, the aggregate of form is composed of the four great elements.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b07_12']	四大者，即地水火風界。	四大者，即地水火風界。	001	The four great elements are the earth, water, fire, and wind elements.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b08_4']	復生五色，謂色聲香味觸。	復生五色，謂色聲香味觸。	001	They further give rise to the five forms, namely form, sound, smell, taste, and touch.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b09_3']	彼地大等及五色等，一一各自性不可得。	彼地大等及五色等，一一各自性不可得。	001	Those great elements such as earth and the five forms and so forth, each and every one of their natures cannot be attained.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b10_6']	如是諸法皆然，是故知色名虛假，由此知色蘊空。	如是諸法皆然，是故知色名虛假，由此知色蘊空。	001	All dharmas are like this. Therefore, know that the name form is a false designation. By this, know that the aggregate of form is empty.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b10_18']	譬如因樹有影，樹滅影亡。	譬如因樹有影，樹滅影亡。	001	It is like how because there is a tree, there is a shadow. When the tree perishes, the shadow disappears.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b11_8']	色蘊如是，受蘊亦然。	色蘊如是，受蘊亦然。	001	The aggregate of form is like this. The aggregate of feeling is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b11_13']	云何名受？	云何名受？	001	What is called feeling?
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b12_18']	受有三種，謂苦受、樂受、非苦樂受，而此三受互相因緣。	受有三種，謂苦受、樂受、非苦樂受，而此三受互相因緣。	001	There are three kinds of feeling: painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant, and these three feelings mutually condition each other.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b13_9']	復有二種，謂身受、意受。	復有二種，謂身受、意受。	001	There are also two kinds: bodily feeling and mental feeling.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b15_15']	身色蘊攝，身不可得，故若無身即無受，亦不可言亦不可說、非短非長非色非相、無實無著，不可知故。	身色蘊攝，身不可得，故若無身即無受，亦不可言亦不可說、非短非長非色非相、無實無著，不可知故。	001	The body is included in the form aggregate, and the body cannot be apprehended, so if there is no body, there is no feeling. It cannot be said or spoken of, is neither short nor long, neither form nor appearance, has no reality and no attachment, because it cannot be known.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b16_6']	身受如是，意受亦然。	身受如是，意受亦然。	001	Bodily feeling is like this, and mental feeling is the same.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b16_11']	受蘊如是。	受蘊如是。	001	The aggregate of feeling is like this.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b17_3']	見受蘊空，想蘊亦虛假不實。	見受蘊空，想蘊亦虛假不實。	001	Seeing the aggregate of feeling as empty, the aggregate of perception is also false and unreal.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b18_2']	緣慮所攝，而彼緣慮不可得故，即非緣慮。	緣慮所攝，而彼緣慮不可得故，即非緣慮。	001	It is included in the object of cognition, but that object of cognition cannot be apprehended, so it is not the object of cognition.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b18_12']	非緣慮故，見想蘊空。	非緣慮故，見想蘊空。	001	Because it is not the object of cognition, one sees the aggregate of perception as empty.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b19_1']	想蘊如是，行蘊亦然。	想蘊如是，行蘊亦然。	001	The aggregate of perception is like this, and the aggregate of mental formations is the same.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b19_17']	心所造作善意記念等行，無所有故。	心所造作善意記念等行，無所有故。	001	Mental activities that are created by the mind, such as the good mind, memory, etc., do not exist.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b21_12']	彼心法所生色等蘊，一一無所生，是故知行蘊業相不實亦無主宰，即見行蘊空。	彼心法所生色等蘊，一一無所生，是故知行蘊業相不實亦無主宰，即見行蘊空。	001	The form and so forth that arise from mental factors are each unborn. Therefore, know that the characteristics of the activity aggregate are unreal and without a master, and thus see the emptiness of the activity aggregate.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b22_2']	行蘊如是，識蘊亦然。	行蘊如是，識蘊亦然。	001	The activity aggregate is like this, and so is the consciousness aggregate.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b23_5']	乃至眼耳鼻舌身意，彼眼識等一一自性皆不可得。	乃至眼耳鼻舌身意，彼眼識等一一自性皆不可得。	001	Up to the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, each of those eye consciousnesses and so forth cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b24_4']	彼眼緣有色，從緣生識，無緣即不生識。	彼眼緣有色，從緣生識，無緣即不生識。	001	That eye has form as a condition, and consciousness arises from conditions. Without conditions, consciousness is not produced.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b25_13']	而此眼色及彼色蘊等無分齊，此分別眼色即非眼色，識無所生。	而此眼色及彼色蘊等無分齊，此分別眼色即非眼色，識無所生。	001	But this eye and form, and those form aggregates and so forth, are not limited. This discrimination of eye and form is not eye and form, and consciousness is not produced.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b26_17']	眼識如是，耳鼻舌身意亦然，如是知此識依止摩曩識。	眼識如是，耳鼻舌身意亦然，如是知此識依止摩曩識。	001	Eye consciousness is like this, and the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are also like this. Thus, know that this consciousness depends on the storehouse consciousness.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b27_18']	由依止摩曩識故，即發生過去未來見在法故。	由依止摩曩識故，即發生過去未來見在法故。	001	Because it depends on the storehouse consciousness, it gives rise to past, future, and present dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b28_9']	云何過去未來見在法？	云何過去未來見在法？	001	How are there past, future, and present dharmas?
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562b29_13']	謂過去已滅、未來未生、見在不住，由是知識蘊空。	謂過去已滅、未來未生、見在不住，由是知識蘊空。	001	That is to say, the past has already ceased, the future has not yet arisen, and the present does not abide. Thus, know that the consciousness aggregate is empty.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c01_13']	如是一一說蘊處界，各各分別，自性皆空。	如是一一說蘊處界，各各分別，自性皆空。	001	In this way, each of the aggregates, sense bases, and elements are explained, and their individual natures are all empty.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c03_5']	彼非無性即真實句，喻無種子不生芽莖，是故說彼蘊處界等亦離取捨。	彼非無性即真實句，喻無種子不生芽莖，是故說彼蘊處界等亦離取捨。	001	They are not without nature, but are the true words. It is like a sprout not growing without a seed. Therefore, it is said that the aggregates, sense bases, and elements, etc., are also free from grasping and abandoning.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c03_15']	云何菩提心無取無捨？	云何菩提心無取無捨？	001	How is the bodhicitta free from grasping and abandoning?

['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c07_11']	又祕密主！	又祕密主！	001	Moreover, Lord of Secrets!
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c10_2']	菩提心非欲界性、非色界性、非天性、非夜叉、非乾闥婆、非阿修羅、非人非非人等性，乃至一切智求亦不可得。	菩提心非欲界性、非色界性、非天性、非夜叉、非乾闥婆、非阿修羅、非人非非人等性，乃至一切智求亦不可得。	001	The bodhicitta is not of the nature of the desire realm, not of the nature of the form realm, not of the nature of the gods, not of the nature of the yakṣas, not of the nature of the gandharvas, not of the nature of the asuras, not of the nature of humans, not of the nature of non-humans, and so forth, up to the wisdom of all things, which is also unobtainable.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c10_15']	如是取心非有，云何言有捨？	如是取心非有，云何言有捨？	001	If the mind of grasping does not exist, how can it be said to have abandonment?
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c11_7']	故又如佛說，告祕密主：	故又如佛說，告祕密主：	001	Therefore, it is also as the Buddha said, addressing the Lord of Mysteries:
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c12_3']	菩提心非內非外非中間，不可得故。	菩提心非內非外非中間，不可得故。	001	The mind of enlightenment is neither internal nor external nor in between, because it cannot be attained.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c12_8']	於意云何？	於意云何？	001	What do you think?
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c12_15']	以自性寂靜故。	以自性寂靜故。	001	Because of its inherent quiescence.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c13_1']	又祕密主！	又祕密主！	001	Moreover, Lord of Mysteries!
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c13_20']	彼菩提心，一切智求不可得，云何得取捨？	彼菩提心，一切智求不可得，云何得取捨？	001	That mind of enlightenment, sought by all-knowledge, cannot be attained, so how can it be grasped or abandoned?
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c14_13']	如是於法得離取捨，平等無我。	如是於法得離取捨，平等無我。	001	Thus, with regard to phenomena, one attains freedom from grasping and abandonment, equality, and non-self.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c15_4']	如一切法，無我亦然。	如一切法，無我亦然。	001	As with all phenomena, non-self is also thus.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c15_15']	如佛所說，菩提心亦然。	如佛所說，菩提心亦然。	001	As the Buddha has said, the mind of enlightenment is also thus.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c16_16']	一切法空、無相、無我，諸法寂靜無寂靜相。	一切法空、無相、無我，諸法寂靜無寂靜相。	001	All phenomena are empty, signless, and without self, and phenomena are quiescent, with the characteristic of quiescence.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c17_8']	心本平等，本來不生亦非不生。	心本平等，本來不生亦非不生。	001	The mind is originally equal, originally unborn, and also not unborn.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c17_13']	復云何性？	復云何性？	001	Moreover, what is its nature?

['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c18_9']	謂如虛空故。	謂如虛空故。	001	It is said to be like space.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c19_4']	如佛所說，虛空之性，空無喻故。	如佛所說，虛空之性，空無喻故。	001	As the Buddha has said, the nature of space is empty, without analogy.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c20_14']	菩提之心亦復如是，菩提之名非性非相、無生無滅、非覺非無覺。	菩提之心亦復如是，菩提之名非性非相、無生無滅、非覺非無覺。	001	The mind of enlightenment is also like this. The name of enlightenment is neither a nature nor a characteristic, neither arising nor ceasing, neither awareness nor non-awareness.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c21_7']	若如是了知，是名菩提心。	若如是了知，是名菩提心。	001	If one understands in this way, this is called the mind of enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c21_17']	又如佛說，告祕密主：	又如佛說，告祕密主：	001	Moreover, as the Buddha said, addressing the Lord of Mysteries:
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c23_9']	於自本心如實了知，於無有法亦不可得，是故名阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	於自本心如實了知，於無有法亦不可得，是故名阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	001	Truly understand one's own mind as it is, and in the absence of dharmas, it cannot be attained. Therefore, it is called anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c23_15']	又告祕密主：	又告祕密主：	001	He further addressed the Lord of Mysteries:
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c26_10']	當於自心如實觀已，然後發起方便觀於眾生，知諸眾生於自覺性不如實知，起於疑妄顛倒執著，受於種種輪迴大苦。	當於自心如實觀已，然後發起方便觀於眾生，知諸眾生於自覺性不如實知，起於疑妄顛倒執著，受於種種輪迴大苦。	001	Having contemplated one's own mind as it is, one should then give rise to skillful means and contemplate sentient beings. Know that sentient beings, regarding their own nature of enlightenment, do not truly understand it, give rise to doubt, delusion, and inverted attachments, and undergo the great suffering of various transmigrations.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c27_14']	我由此故起大悲心，令諸眾生於自心法如實證覺。	我由此故起大悲心，令諸眾生於自心法如實證覺。	001	I give rise to the mind of great compassion for this reason, to enable sentient beings to truly realize enlightenment regarding the dharmas of their own minds.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c29_2']	是即名為菩提心，是名利益心、安樂心、最上心、法界善覺心。	是即名為菩提心，是名利益心、安樂心、最上心、法界善覺心。	001	This is called the mind of enlightenment, the mind of benefit, the mind of bliss, the supreme mind, and the mind of skillful awareness of the dharma realm.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0562c29_17']	以如是智攝諸眾生故，名菩提心。	以如是智攝諸眾生故，名菩提心。	001	Because with such wisdom one embraces all sentient beings, it is called the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0563a02_14']	發此心故，所獲福德亦如虛空無有邊際，其功德海亦復無量，雖復劫盡功德無盡。	發此心故，所獲福德亦如虛空無有邊際，其功德海亦復無量，雖復劫盡功德無盡。	001	Because this mind is aroused, the merit obtained is also boundless like space, and the ocean of merit is also immeasurable, although it is inexhaustible even at the end of the kalpa.
['ZH_T32_1663_001:0563a03_11']	如是名為發一切智根本最上菩提心。	如是名為發一切智根本最上菩提心。	001	This is called arousing the supreme bodhi mind, which is the fundamental basis of omniscience.
