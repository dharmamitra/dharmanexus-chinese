['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a27_15']	若取著言詮，即為戲論。	若取著言詮，即為戲論。	001	If one grasps at verbal expressions, then it becomes idle speculation.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a29_9']	如其言詮，於如是性執有性者，彼皆息滅，此即名為滅諸戲論、離諸嬈惱性。	如其言詮，於如是性執有性者，彼皆息滅，此即名為滅諸戲論、離諸嬈惱性。	001	If one grasps at the existence of such a nature according to the verbal explanations, all of that will cease, and this is called the cessation of all conceptual proliferation and the abandonment of all afflictive natures.

This treatise explains this meaning, and this meaning is established. All other treatises are the same in relying on this principle.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b07_6']	若因中有故，設因壞時後還不離果起，無前後時性故。	若因中有故，設因壞時後還不離果起，無前後時性故。	001	If it exists in the cause, then even if the cause is destroyed, the effect will not arise again later, because there is no nature of prior and posterior time.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b08_8']	如澡沐已受食，此非緣生，若言無生，自語相違。	如澡沐已受食，此非緣生，若言無生，自語相違。	001	Like bathing and then eating, this is not dependent origination. If it is said to be unproduced, it contradicts one's own words.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b09_5']	不和合對治，此即世俗緣生不和合故。	不和合對治，此即世俗緣生不和合故。	001	The antidote to non-combination is precisely because the conventional dependent origination is not combined.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b10_18']	世俗諦識中體性不和合勝義諦體性，此中止遣。	世俗諦識中體性不和合勝義諦體性，此中止遣。	001	The nature of the consciousness of the conventional truth is not combined with the nature of the ultimate truth, and this is refuted here.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b11_5']	何等是世俗？	何等是世俗？	001	What is the conventional?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b11_11']	何等是勝義？	何等是勝義？	001	What is the ultimate?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b14_2']	若勝上所說相續義性，以世俗諦伺察時此不和合，以彼現證非涅槃所得，此所作性不異勝義諦故，亦不止遣。	若勝上所說相續義性，以世俗諦伺察時此不和合，以彼現證非涅槃所得，此所作性不異勝義諦故，亦不止遣。	001	If the nature of the continuity that is spoken of as supreme is investigated with the conventional truth, this is not combined, because that which is realized is not attained in nirvana, and the nature of what is done is not different from the ultimate truth, so it is also not refuted.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b15_4']	若智所成，即彼世俗諦不異勝義諦，如瓶等色等。	若智所成，即彼世俗諦不異勝義諦，如瓶等色等。	001	If it is accomplished by wisdom, then the conventional truth is not different from the ultimate truth, like a vase and so forth, form and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b17_9']	而此一類色受等法，決定境界智不許可，彼智無性故，譬如瓶等墮世俗有性，雖無所取，非世俗無。	而此一類色受等法，決定境界智不許可，彼智無性故，譬如瓶等墮世俗有性，雖無所取，非世俗無。	001	But this one kind of form, feeling, and so forth, the wisdom that determines the object cannot be allowed, because that wisdom is without nature, like a vase and so forth, which although without what is grasped, is not conventionally nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b18_11']	此中所說，世俗所取之義，是自非他，如理應知。	此中所說，世俗所取之義，是自非他，如理應知。	001	Here, the meaning taken by the conventional is one's own, not another's, and should be understood according to reason.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b20_1']	世俗者即是世俗所取故，如樹林等非極微許，而有所取道理可得。	世俗者即是世俗所取故，如樹林等非極微許，而有所取道理可得。	001	The conventional is precisely that taken by the conventional, like a forest and so forth, which are not admitted to be atoms, yet the principle of being taken can be obtained.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b22_14']	若方分分別差別分別等性，而彼決定世俗有性，此非道理，以物體遍計有樹林等對礙，而識中有彼樹林等為所表故。	若方分分別差別分別等性，而彼決定世俗有性，此非道理，以物體遍計有樹林等對礙，而識中有彼樹林等為所表故。	001	If the nature of directional parts, discrimination, and differentiation, and so forth are definitely conventionally existent, this is not reasonable, because the substance is imagined to have a forest and so forth that obstruct, and there are those forests and so forth in consciousness that are to be manifested.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b25_1']	然識中物性非無道理，由是樹於彼識而為所緣，如是能表識中得有所表，是故非物體樹於識中有。	然識中物性非無道理，由是樹於彼識而為所緣，如是能表識中得有所表，是故非物體樹於識中有。	001	However, the principle of the nature of things in consciousness is not non-existent, because in this way a tree is the object of that consciousness, and in this way the consciousness that can manifest obtains what is manifested. Therefore, the substance of a tree does not exist in consciousness.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b25_12']	此如是說故，餘說亦然。	此如是說故，餘說亦然。	001	This is said to be so, and the rest is also like this.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b26_7']	於能表所表中，遍計無體亦無所成。	於能表所表中，遍計無體亦無所成。	001	Within the manifested and the manifesting, the imagined has no substance and also nothing to be accomplished.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b26_13']	何法可成邪？	何法可成邪？	001	What dharma can be accomplished?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b27_5']	謂如諸佛境界色等決定。	謂如諸佛境界色等決定。	001	It is like the colors and so forth that are definite in the realm of the buddhas.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b27_10']	此何不成？	此何不成？	001	How can this not be established?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b28_15']	如彼諸佛境界，此亦然有，非如識中遍計生等此中止遣。	如彼諸佛境界，此亦然有，非如識中遍計生等此中止遣。	001	Just as in the realms of those buddhas, this is also so, not like the imagination arising in consciousness, etc. This is eliminated here.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b29_10']	識中物體若有性者，此非道理。	識中物體若有性者，此非道理。	001	If the substance in consciousness has a nature, this is not reasonable.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c01_18']	若彼勝上如來之智，如所說義故名勝義，餘皆世俗，不實性故。	若彼勝上如來之智，如所說義故名勝義，餘皆世俗，不實性故。	001	If that supreme wisdom of the Tathāgata is called the ultimate because of the meaning as it is taught, the rest are conventional because of their unreal nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c02_12']	此說最上，謂佛所說善文善義。	此說最上，謂佛所說善文善義。	001	This is said to be supreme, namely what is well spoken by the Buddha with good words and good meaning.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c02_17']	是故頌言：	是故頌言：	001	Therefore, the verse says:
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c03_14']	「我稽首禮佛，　　諸說中第一。	「我稽首禮佛，　　諸說中第一。	001	I bow my head in reverence to the Buddha, the foremost among all teachers.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c04_2']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	001	The commentary says:
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c05_1']	若文義二無著智性，唯佛大師而善宣說。	若文義二無著智性，唯佛大師而善宣說。	001	If the nature of non-attachment to both words and meaning is the wisdom of the Great Teacher Buddha, he skillfully proclaims it.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c05_6']	何所說邪？	何所說邪？	001	What is being taught?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c05_12']	謂說無生性。	謂說無生性。	001	It is said to be the nature of non-arising.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c07_5']	今為證成無生性故，彼無滅等諸差別義亦如是證成，如是建立無生法故。	今為證成無生性故，彼無滅等諸差別義亦如是證成，如是建立無生法故。	001	Now, in order to prove the nature of non-arising, the meaning of non-cessation, etc., and all the distinctions are also thus proven. In this way, the principle of non-arising is established.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c07_10']	或有人言：	或有人言：	001	Some people say:
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c08_6']	所說生者，我知差別之性如是自生。	所說生者，我知差別之性如是自生。	001	The meaning of arising that is explained is that we understand the nature of distinction to arise by itself in this way.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c08_17']	為遮遣彼說，是故頌言：	為遮遣彼說，是故頌言：	001	In order to refute that explanation, therefore the verse says:

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c11_1']	自者，我性義。	自者，我性義。	001	Self means the meaning of self-nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c11_11']	彼如是說，互相損惱。	彼如是說，互相損惱。	001	They explain it like this, mutually harming each other.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c12_1']	自語相違，不和合對治。	自語相違，不和合對治。	001	The self-contradictory words do not correspond to the antidote.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c13_5']	或如瓶等，即不見有自生之法，如前瓶等，自體無性故。	或如瓶等，即不見有自生之法，如前瓶等，自體無性故。	001	Or like a pot, etc., one does not see the dharma of self-arising, like a pot, etc., in front, because the self-nature does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c14_1']	諸生法無性，生已復生，亦復無性。	諸生法無性，生已復生，亦復無性。	001	The nature of all dharmas that arise does not exist. Having arisen, to arise again is also without nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c14_19']	如是眼等決定和合，若爾即有對治過失。	如是眼等決定和合，若爾即有對治過失。	001	In this way, the eye, etc. are definitely combined. If so, then there is the fault of the antidote.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c23_2']	若彼決定實無所成，所說無異如瓶所作。	若彼決定實無所成，所說無異如瓶所作。	001	If that is definitely truly established, what is said is without difference, like the product of the pot.

Therefore, the six sense bases such as the eye are not able to accomplish the dharma of conditions.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0137c29_11']	若彼決定別異生法為可有者，彼無生法中間所作若生，而彼眼等決定生法互相離性或如是生，亦何不成？	若彼決定別異生法為可有者，彼無生法中間所作若生，而彼眼等決定生法互相離性或如是生，亦何不成？	001	If that definitely separate and different arising dharma can exist, then that non-arising dharma in the middle would be produced if it arises. Then that eye, etc., which is definitely an arising dharma, would either arise separately from each other or like this, so how could it not be established?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a01_8']	如是說者，彼無自性法，此中有過失。	如是說者，彼無自性法，此中有過失。	001	In this way, it is said that there is a fault in that non-intrinsic nature dharma.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a03_3']	若從緣生果，彼果性無依，緣亦無常，相離性中果云何成？	若從緣生果，彼果性無依，緣亦無常，相離性中果云何成？	001	If a result arises from conditions, that result has no basis, and the conditions are also impermanent. How can a result be established in a separate nature?

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a09_12']	若或無緣，果即不成；	若或無緣，果即不成；	001	If there are no conditions, the result will not be accomplished;
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a11_6']	若有果故，彼諸法體即有所得，彼等諸法亦非先有性故，是義當知從緣所生。	若有果故，彼諸法體即有所得，彼等諸法亦非先有性故，是義當知從緣所生。	001	If there is a result, then those dharmas would have something obtained, but those dharmas also do not have a prior nature, therefore this meaning should be known as arising from conditions.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a12_6']	若離緣生，虛無有果，譬如芽等，何能和合？	若離緣生，虛無有果，譬如芽等，何能和合？	001	If apart from arising from conditions, there is no result, it is like a sprout, how can it be able to unite?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a13_14']	若言從種生芽，即能生所生二和合故，亦非種子等緣一向能生。	若言從種生芽，即能生所生二和合故，亦非種子等緣一向能生。	001	If it is said that from the seed the sprout is born, then the able to produce and the produced unite, therefore the seed and so forth are not conditions that are able to produce in one direction.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a14_13']	以餘法成即能有果，由如是故果非常有。	以餘法成即能有果，由如是故果非常有。	001	Because other dharmas are accomplished, then there is a result, because of this the result is not permanently existent.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a14_18']	或有人言：	或有人言：	001	Some people say:
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a16_3']	從緣有果，此即非常亦非無常，如是性中能生得成。	從緣有果，此即非常亦非無常，如是性中能生得成。	001	From conditions there is a result, this is not permanent and also not impermanent, in this nature it is able to produce and accomplish.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a16_7']	釋者言：	釋者言：	001	The expounder says:
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a17_1']	如汝所說，此有法故，即此所成。	如汝所說，此有法故，即此所成。	001	As you say, because this dharma exists, then this is accomplished.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a18_7']	如是決定勝義諦中，非無緣有果、非無果有緣，俱不見故。	如是決定勝義諦中，非無緣有果、非無果有緣，俱不見故。	001	In this way, in the definitive ultimate truth, there are no conditions without a result, and there are no results without conditions, because both are not seen.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a19_10']	眼等諸法此中亦然，於其緣性若止遣者，定知有過。	眼等諸法此中亦然，於其緣性若止遣者，定知有過。	001	The same is so for the dharmas of the eyes, etc. If one negates their causal nature, one will definitely know that there is an error.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a19_20']	是故當知，從緣有果。	是故當知，從緣有果。	001	Therefore, one should know that there are effects from conditions.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a21_1']	諸果體生，謂從因緣、次第緣、所緣緣、增上緣生故。	諸果體生，謂從因緣、次第緣、所緣緣、增上緣生故。	001	The arising of the essence of various effects is from causal conditions, sequential conditions, objective conditions, and dominant conditions.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a23_4']	以諸緣分別、果體差別如是得成，譬如已成熟果，而諸因體差別分別，是故能作所作此中分別。	以諸緣分別、果體差別如是得成，譬如已成熟果，而諸因體差別分別，是故能作所作此中分別。	001	The distinctions of effects are accomplished through the distinctions of conditions in this way, just as a ripe fruit. The distinctions of the essences of various causes are thus distinguished. Therefore, the distinctions of the agent and the action are made here.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a24_3']	此如是說決定有果，決定之言即印持義。	此如是說決定有果，決定之言即印持義。	001	This is said to definitely have effects. The word definite means to confirm.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a26_13']	若果性有著，即他宗義，謂於緣中非實有果。	若果性有著，即他宗義，謂於緣中非實有果。	001	If the nature of effects has attachment, then it is the meaning of other schools, namely, that effects do not really exist within conditions.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a28_9']	若彼如是從緣生果，互相所攝有果隨轉，彼雖分位各別，然有果生，此說緣生。	若彼如是從緣生果，互相所攝有果隨轉，彼雖分位各別，然有果生，此說緣生。	001	If it is like this, arising from conditions and producing effects, mutually subsuming and having effects that follow, although their states are each different, still effects arise. This is called conditioned arising.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a29_3']	是故此等諸緣生已，亦各別故。	是故此等諸緣生已，亦各別故。	001	Therefore, these conditions, having already arisen, also each differ.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a29_16']	諸未信許言，即是不樂說義。	諸未信許言，即是不樂說義。	001	Those who have not yet believed and accepted this say it is not a pleasant explanation.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138b01_8']	若此果不生，即彼無有緣。	若此果不生，即彼無有緣。	001	If this effect does not arise, then there are no conditions.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138b01_13']	何等為緣？	何等為緣？	001	What are the conditions?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138b01_19']	謂隨所意樂。	謂隨所意樂。	001	It is said to be according to one's wishes.
