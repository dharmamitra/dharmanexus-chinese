['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a13_9']	菩薩為開示故，造此《中論》。	菩薩為開示故，造此《中論》。	In order to reveal this, the Bodhisattva composed this Middle Treatise.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a14_1']	然此不同一切外道所說緣生。	然此不同一切外道所說緣生。	However, this is different from the dependent origination taught by all non-Buddhists.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a20_14']	發起名生，斷生死故名斷，擇滅涅槃常時性故名常。	發起名生，斷生死故名斷，擇滅涅槃常時性故名常。	Arising is called birth, and because it cuts off birth and death, it is called cessation. The nature of cessation and nirvana is always present, so it is called permanence.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a23_4']	如所說離，此即是為緣生之法。	如所說離，此即是為緣生之法。	As it is said, separation is precisely the dharma of dependent origination.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a25_9']	若無來義轉時，此即無去。	若無來義轉時，此即無去。	If there is no meaning of coming, then there is no going.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a26_3']	無去義轉時，即無過去世所行。	無去義轉時，即無過去世所行。	When there is no meaning of going, then there is no past world to be practiced.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a26_13']	非今有滅，此即無滅。	非今有滅，此即無滅。	Not having extinction now, this is non-extinction.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a27_15']	若取著言詮，即為戲論。	若取著言詮，即為戲論。	If one grasps at verbal expressions, then it becomes idle speculation.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136a29_9']	如其言詮，於如是性執有性者，彼皆息滅，此即名為滅諸戲論、離諸嬈惱性。	如其言詮，於如是性執有性者，彼皆息滅，此即名為滅諸戲論、離諸嬈惱性。	If one grasps at the existence of such a nature according to the verbal explanations, all of that will cease, and this is called the cessation of all conceptual proliferation and the abandonment of all afflictive natures.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b01_1']	分別自性空已乃名寂靜。	分別自性空已乃名寂靜。	The emptiness of inherent nature is now called quiescent.

This treatise explains this meaning, and this meaning is established. All other treatises are the same in relying on this principle.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b05_1']	今此義中，若此因、若彼緣，如薪生火，而彼所取如是應知。	今此義中，若此因、若彼緣，如薪生火，而彼所取如是應知。	In this meaning, whether it is the cause or the conditions, it is like kindling producing fire. One should understand the object of grasping in this way.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b07_6']	若因中有故，設因壞時後還不離果起，無前後時性故。	若因中有故，設因壞時後還不離果起，無前後時性故。	If it exists in the cause, then even if the cause is destroyed, the effect will not arise again later, because there is no nature of prior and posterior time.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b08_8']	如澡沐已受食，此非緣生，若言無生，自語相違。	如澡沐已受食，此非緣生，若言無生，自語相違。	Like bathing and then eating, this is not dependent origination. If it is said to be unproduced, it contradicts one's own words.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b09_5']	不和合對治，此即世俗緣生不和合故。	不和合對治，此即世俗緣生不和合故。	The antidote to non-combination is precisely because the conventional dependent origination is not combined.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b09_17']	若勝義諦所生，此中止遣。	若勝義諦所生，此中止遣。	If it is produced by the ultimate truth, this is refuted here.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b11_5']	何等是世俗？	何等是世俗？	What is the conventional?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b11_11']	何等是勝義？	何等是勝義？	What is the ultimate?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b14_2']	若勝上所說相續義性，以世俗諦伺察時此不和合，以彼現證非涅槃所得，此所作性不異勝義諦故，亦不止遣。	若勝上所說相續義性，以世俗諦伺察時此不和合，以彼現證非涅槃所得，此所作性不異勝義諦故，亦不止遣。	If the nature of the continuity that is spoken of as supreme is investigated with the conventional truth, this is not combined, because that which is realized is not attained in nirvana, and the nature of what is done is not different from the ultimate truth, so it is also not refuted.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b15_4']	若智所成，即彼世俗諦不異勝義諦，如瓶等色等。	若智所成，即彼世俗諦不異勝義諦，如瓶等色等。	If it is accomplished by wisdom, then the conventional truth is not different from the ultimate truth, like a vase and so forth, form and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b17_9']	而此一類色受等法，決定境界智不許可，彼智無性故，譬如瓶等墮世俗有性，雖無所取，非世俗無。	而此一類色受等法，決定境界智不許可，彼智無性故，譬如瓶等墮世俗有性，雖無所取，非世俗無。	But this one kind of form, feeling, and so forth, the wisdom that determines the object cannot be allowed, because that wisdom is without nature, like a vase and so forth, which although without what is grasped, is not conventionally nonexistent.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b18_11']	此中所說，世俗所取之義，是自非他，如理應知。	此中所說，世俗所取之義，是自非他，如理應知。	Here, the meaning taken by the conventional is one's own, not another's, and should be understood according to reason.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b20_1']	世俗者即是世俗所取故，如樹林等非極微許，而有所取道理可得。	世俗者即是世俗所取故，如樹林等非極微許，而有所取道理可得。	The conventional is precisely that taken by the conventional, like a forest and so forth, which are not admitted to be atoms, yet the principle of being taken can be obtained.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b22_14']	若方分分別差別分別等性，而彼決定世俗有性，此非道理，以物體遍計有樹林等對礙，而識中有彼樹林等為所表故。	若方分分別差別分別等性，而彼決定世俗有性，此非道理，以物體遍計有樹林等對礙，而識中有彼樹林等為所表故。	If the nature of directional parts, discrimination, and differentiation, and so forth are definitely conventionally existent, this is not reasonable, because the substance is imagined to have a forest and so forth that obstruct, and there are those forests and so forth in consciousness that are to be manifested.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b25_1']	然識中物性非無道理，由是樹於彼識而為所緣，如是能表識中得有所表，是故非物體樹於識中有。	然識中物性非無道理，由是樹於彼識而為所緣，如是能表識中得有所表，是故非物體樹於識中有。	However, the principle of the nature of things in consciousness is not non-existent, because in this way a tree is the object of that consciousness, and in this way the consciousness that can manifest obtains what is manifested. Therefore, the substance of a tree does not exist in consciousness.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b25_12']	此如是說故，餘說亦然。	此如是說故，餘說亦然。	This is said to be so, and the rest is also like this.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b26_7']	於能表所表中，遍計無體亦無所成。	於能表所表中，遍計無體亦無所成。	Within the manifested and the manifesting, the imagined has no substance and also nothing to be accomplished.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b26_13']	何法可成邪？	何法可成邪？	What dharma can be accomplished?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b27_5']	謂如諸佛境界色等決定。	謂如諸佛境界色等決定。	It is like the colors and so forth that are definite in the realm of the buddhas.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b27_10']	此何不成？	此何不成？	How can this not be established?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b28_15']	如彼諸佛境界，此亦然有，非如識中遍計生等此中止遣。	如彼諸佛境界，此亦然有，非如識中遍計生等此中止遣。	Just as in the realms of those buddhas, this is also so, not like the imagination arising in consciousness, etc. This is eliminated here.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136b29_10']	識中物體若有性者，此非道理。	識中物體若有性者，此非道理。	If the substance in consciousness has a nature, this is not reasonable.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c01_18']	若彼勝上如來之智，如所說義故名勝義，餘皆世俗，不實性故。	若彼勝上如來之智，如所說義故名勝義，餘皆世俗，不實性故。	If that supreme wisdom of the Tathāgata is called the ultimate because of the meaning as it is taught, the rest are conventional because of their unreal nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c02_12']	此說最上，謂佛所說善文善義。	此說最上，謂佛所說善文善義。	This is said to be supreme, namely what is well spoken by the Buddha with good words and good meaning.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c02_17']	是故頌言：	是故頌言：	Therefore, the verse says:
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c03_14']	「我稽首禮佛，　　諸說中第一。	「我稽首禮佛，　　諸說中第一。	I bow my head in reverence to the Buddha, the foremost among all teachers.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c05_1']	若文義二無著智性，唯佛大師而善宣說。	若文義二無著智性，唯佛大師而善宣說。	If the nature of non-attachment to both words and meaning is the wisdom of the Great Teacher Buddha, he skillfully proclaims it.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c05_6']	何所說邪？	何所說邪？	What is being taught?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c05_12']	謂說無生性。	謂說無生性。	It is said to be the nature of non-arising.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c07_5']	今為證成無生性故，彼無滅等諸差別義亦如是證成，如是建立無生法故。	今為證成無生性故，彼無滅等諸差別義亦如是證成，如是建立無生法故。	Now, in order to prove the nature of non-arising, the meaning of non-cessation, etc., and all the distinctions are also thus proven. In this way, the principle of non-arising is established.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c07_10']	或有人言：	或有人言：	Some people say:
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c08_6']	所說生者，我知差別之性如是自生。	所說生者，我知差別之性如是自生。	The meaning of arising that is explained is that we understand the nature of distinction to arise by itself in this way.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c08_17']	為遮遣彼說，是故頌言：	為遮遣彼說，是故頌言：	In order to refute that explanation, therefore the verse says:

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c10_15']	所言生者，本無今有之別名。	所言生者，本無今有之別名。	What is called arising is a different name for what was originally non-existent but now exists.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c11_1']	自者，我性義。	自者，我性義。	Self means the meaning of self-nature.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c12_1']	自語相違，不和合對治。	自語相違，不和合對治。	The self-contradictory words do not correspond to the antidote.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c13_5']	或如瓶等，即不見有自生之法，如前瓶等，自體無性故。	或如瓶等，即不見有自生之法，如前瓶等，自體無性故。	Or like a pot, etc., one does not see the dharma of self-arising, like a pot, etc., in front, because the self-nature does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c14_1']	諸生法無性，生已復生，亦復無性。	諸生法無性，生已復生，亦復無性。	The nature of all dharmas that arise does not exist. Having arisen, to arise again is also without nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c14_19']	如是眼等決定和合，若爾即有對治過失。	如是眼等決定和合，若爾即有對治過失。	In this way, the eye, etc. are definitely combined. If so, then there is the fault of the antidote.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c15_11']	若有如是因，即有如是果。	若有如是因，即有如是果。	If there is such a cause, then there is such a result.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c16_8']	彼果體有生，以因果二法無別異性故。	彼果體有生，以因果二法無別異性故。	The essence of that result has arising, because the two dharmas of cause and effect have no different nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c16_18']	若言自生，此應思擇。	若言自生，此應思擇。	If it is said to arise from itself, this should be examined.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c18_13']	若離泥團，果因二種無別異性。	若離泥團，果因二種無別異性。	If separate from the clay lump, the two, effect and cause, have no separate nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c19_8']	若泥團離瓶，而此果體即不和合。	若泥團離瓶，而此果體即不和合。	If the clay lump is separate from the pot, then this nature of the effect is not combined.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c20_7']	泥團若壞，瓶有所得，即非果時有因性故。	泥團若壞，瓶有所得，即非果時有因性故。	If the clay lump is destroyed, and the pot is obtained, then at the time of the effect, it has the nature of the cause.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c23_2']	若彼決定實無所成，所說無異如瓶所作。	若彼決定實無所成，所說無異如瓶所作。	If that is definitely truly established, what is said is without difference, like the product of the pot.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c24_5']	杖輪水等非此所闕，彼等無別異性，因果二無性故。	杖輪水等非此所闕，彼等無別異性，因果二無性故。	The staff, wheel, water, and so forth are not lacking here, they have no separate nature, because the two, cause and effect, are without nature.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c24_11']	何名無別異？	何名無別異？	What is called without difference?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c25_1']	謂不見因自體能作。	謂不見因自體能作。	It means that the self-nature of the cause is not seen to be able to produce.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0136c25_18']	如是果有所作，亦復不得，無異性故。	如是果有所作，亦復不得，無異性故。	In this way, the effect has something produced, but it is also not obtained, because it has no different nature.

['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a11_6']	若有果故，彼諸法體即有所得，彼等諸法亦非先有性故，是義當知從緣所生。	若有果故，彼諸法體即有所得，彼等諸法亦非先有性故，是義當知從緣所生。	If there is a result, then those dharmas would have something obtained, but those dharmas also do not have a prior nature, therefore this meaning should be known as arising from conditions.
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a12_6']	若離緣生，虛無有果，譬如芽等，何能和合？	若離緣生，虛無有果，譬如芽等，何能和合？	If apart from arising from conditions, there is no result, it is like a sprout, how can it be able to unite?
['ZH_T30_1567_001:0138a13_14']	若言從種生芽，即能生所生二和合故，亦非種子等緣一向能生。	若言從種生芽，即能生所生二和合故，亦非種子等緣一向能生。	If it is said that from the seed the sprout is born, then the able to produce and the produced unite, therefore the seed and so forth are not conditions that are able to produce in one direction.

The distinctions of the essences of various causes are thus distinguished. Therefore, the distinctions of the agent and the action are made here.

This is called conditioned arising.
