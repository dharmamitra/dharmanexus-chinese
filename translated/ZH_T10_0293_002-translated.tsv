Those śrāvakas, though dwelling in the forest, are unable to see the Tathāgata's spiritual powers, nor do they see the assembly of bodhisattvas.

There is another person who opens their eyes and goes there, seeing everything and fully understanding it. The bodhisattvas are also like this. They arrive at the place of the Tathāgata's great Dharma treasure island, which is adorned with the most excellent merits, and clearly see everything. The great disciples, although they are in the forest and are close to the World-Honored One, do not see the Tathāgata's self-mastery, the samādhi's realm, and also do not see the universally adorned assembly of bodhisattvas.
