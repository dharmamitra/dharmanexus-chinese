['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761a20_17']	2 二辯定品第八之二我宗定說初二靜慮樂根為支，違何正理？	2 二辯定品第八之二我宗定說初二靜慮樂根為支，違何正理？	Our school definitely says that the first two dhyānas have the faculty of pleasure as a branch. What correct principle does this contradict?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761a22_6']	汝執身受方有樂根，非諸定中可起身識，豈不與此正理相違？	汝執身受方有樂根，非諸定中可起身識，豈不與此正理相違？	You hold that there is the faculty of pleasure only when there is bodily feeling. In the various samādhis, bodily consciousness cannot arise. Doesn't this contradict this correct principle?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761a24_4']	此亦無違，以我宗許正在定位，由勝定力起順樂受，妙輕安風遍觸於身發身識故。	此亦無違，以我宗許正在定位，由勝定力起順樂受，妙輕安風遍觸於身發身識故。	This also does not contradict. Because our school allows that while in samādhi, due to the power of the superior samādhi, a subtle and light feeling of comfort arises that pervades the body and gives rise to bodily consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761a25_3']	如是救義未離前失，但起身識非在定故。	如是救義未離前失，但起身識非在定故。	This kind of rescue argument is not free from the previous fault, because it only gives rise to bodily consciousness, but it is not in samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761a28_2']	謂我宗亦許正在定位，有離生喜樂所引極微遍在身中，如團中膩力能對治諸煩惱品，身之麁重攝益於身，亦說名為無惱害樂。	謂我宗亦許正在定位，有離生喜樂所引極微遍在身中，如團中膩力能對治諸煩惱品，身之麁重攝益於身，亦說名為無惱害樂。	That is to say, our school also allows that while in samādhi, there is the extremely subtle joy and pleasure that arises from separation from the mundane world, which pervades the body. Like oil in a ball, it has the power to counteract the coarseness of the body that belongs to the class of afflictions, and benefits the body. It is also called the pleasure of being free from harm.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761a29_1']	然不許此在定位中，能觸動身發生身識。	然不許此在定位中，能觸動身發生身識。	However, it is not admitted that in samādhi it can stimulate the body and generate body consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b01_8']	此等持果如是生時，有力能令等持堅住，故此妙觸起不唐捐。	此等持果如是生時，有力能令等持堅住，故此妙觸起不唐捐。	When this result of samādhi arises, it has the power to make samādhi firm and stable, and therefore this marvelous contact is not produced in vain.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b02_7']	若此位中容起身識，外散亂故應壞等持。	若此位中容起身識，外散亂故應壞等持。	If body consciousness is allowed to occur in this state, it would be distracted outward and would destroy samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b03_15']	若謂此風從勝定起，引內身樂順起等持，故身識生無壞定失。	若謂此風從勝定起，引內身樂順起等持，故身識生無壞定失。	If it is said that this wind arises from superior samādhi, attracts the pleasure of the internal body, and conforms to the arising of samādhi, therefore the arising of body consciousness does not destroy samādhi,
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b04_14']	亦不應理，雖順等持而身識生便非定故。	亦不應理，雖順等持而身識生便非定故。	this is also unreasonable, because although it conforms to samādhi, the arising of body consciousness is not samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b05_15']	正在定位有與定相違不定識生，如何不壞定？	正在定位有與定相違不定識生，如何不壞定？	If, while in samādhi, there is an indeterminate consciousness that is contrary to samādhi, how does it not destroy samādhi?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b06_14']	縱順定故非永退失，然散心生寧非出定？	縱順定故非永退失，然散心生寧非出定？	Even if it conforms to samādhi and is not a permanent loss, how is the arising of distracted mind not leaving samādhi?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b08_12']	非起順定加行散心已得名為正住定位，是故身識現在前時，理應名為已從定出。	非起順定加行散心已得名為正住定位，是故身識現在前時，理應名為已從定出。	The arising of a distracted mind that is the preparation for entering samādhi is not called being in the stage of proper samādhi. Therefore, when body consciousness is present, one should be called one who has left samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b09_2']	既爾，寧說是靜慮支？	既爾，寧說是靜慮支？	If this is so, how can it be said to be a member of the trance states?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b10_10']	又此樂生應名定刺，由此樂受身識俱生，間雜定心令不續故。	又此樂生應名定刺，由此樂受身識俱生，間雜定心令不續故。	Moreover, this pleasure should be called a thorn of samādhi, because this pleasant feeling born with the body consciousness interrupts the samādhi mind and prevents it from continuing.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b12_15']	又以欲界身根為依，理不應生色界觸識，故不可說身在欲界，身識俱受領色界中靜慮所生妙輕安觸。	又以欲界身根為依，理不應生色界觸識，故不可說身在欲界，身識俱受領色界中靜慮所生妙輕安觸。	Moreover, it is unreasonable for the body consciousness of the desire realm to arise based on the body faculty of the form realm. Therefore, it cannot be said that the body is in the desire realm, and the body consciousness together with the feeling experiences the subtle and light touch born of the dhyāna in the form realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b13_15']	若謂此觸依內起故，容依欲身發生彼識。	若謂此觸依內起故，容依欲身發生彼識。	If it is said that because this touch arises based on the internal, it is possible for the consciousness to arise based on the body of the desire realm,
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b14_7']	此但有語，無理教故。	此但有語，無理教故。	this is mere words, because there is no reasoning or teaching to prove it.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b15_5']	謂何理教證依欲身取色輕安非所餘觸？	謂何理教證依欲身取色輕安非所餘觸？	What reasoning or teaching proves that the touch of the form realm, which is the subtle and light touch, is grasped based on the body of the desire realm, and not the other touches?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b16_4']	故彼所執違越理教，唯對法宗所說無失。	故彼所執違越理教，唯對法宗所說無失。	Therefore, what they maintain goes against reasoning and teaching. There is no error in the explanation of the Abhidharma masters.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b16_13']	上座於此作如是言：	上座於此作如是言：	The Sthavira says this:
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b17_3']	如何得知輕安名樂？	如何得知輕安名樂？	How do you know that the subtle and light touch is called pleasure?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b17_16']	無少聖教於輕安體立以樂名。	無少聖教於輕安體立以樂名。	There is no holy teaching that establishes the subtle and light touch as pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b18_12']	又見於此餘說名樂，於義無益故。	又見於此餘說名樂，於義無益故。	Moreover, seeing that it is called pleasure in other places is of no benefit to the meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b20_2']	若輕安體應說輕安名，非說輕安有無樂過，經說輕安是樂因故。	若輕安體應說輕安名，非說輕安有無樂過，經說輕安是樂因故。	If the substance of serenity is to be called serenity, then it is not the case that there is the error of serenity not existing and yet being pleasure. The scriptures say that serenity is the cause of pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b20_7']	如契經說：	如契經說：	As a scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b21_1']	心喜故身輕安，輕安故身受樂。	心喜故身輕安，輕安故身受樂。	because the mind is joyful, the body is serene, and because of serenity, the body experiences pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b21_19']	是故知樂非即輕安，破此同前經主所引。	是故知樂非即輕安，破此同前經主所引。	Therefore we know that pleasure is not identical with serenity. The refutation of this is the same as the refuter of the above passage from the śāstra.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b24_4']	然彼所說，若是輕安體應說輕安名，此說非理，為避靜慮支不易說過故，勿說初靜慮離生喜輕安。	然彼所說，若是輕安體應說輕安名，此說非理，為避靜慮支不易說過故，勿說初靜慮離生喜輕安。	However, the above statement that if it is the substance of serenity, it should be called serenity, is unreasonable, because it avoids the error of the difficulty of explaining the members of the meditations, lest it be said that the first meditation is serenity free from initial inquiry.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b25_12']	又此義中輕安名樂，於義有益，下苦所惱，為令欣求上地生故。	又此義中輕安名樂，於義有益，下苦所惱，為令欣求上地生故。	Moreover, in this interpretation, the name pleasure is given to serenity, which is beneficial in meaning, because it is tormented by the suffering below and causes one to seek the arising of the upper stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b27_1']	謂一切地皆有輕安，如何令知上地皆樂，發勤精進離下地染？	謂一切地皆有輕安，如何令知上地皆樂，發勤精進離下地染？	That is, all stages have serenity. How can one know that all upper stages are pleasure and generate effort and progress in order to be free from the defilements of the lower stages?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b28_2']	故於輕安體假立以樂名，於此義中深成有益。	故於輕安體假立以樂名，於此義中深成有益。	Therefore, the name pleasure is provisionally established in the substance of serenity, and it is very beneficial in this interpretation.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761b29_10']	雖輕安樂遍一切地，而今於此靜慮支中，唯樂果因方說名樂。	雖輕安樂遍一切地，而今於此靜慮支中，唯樂果因方說名樂。	Although the bliss of serenity pervades all stages, in this branch of dhyāna, only the cause of the fruit of bliss is called bliss.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c02_3']	第二靜慮雖無樂根，而說彼輕安為樂果因者，以樂根喜根俱說名樂故。	第二靜慮雖無樂根，而說彼輕安為樂果因者，以樂根喜根俱說名樂故。	Although the second dhyāna lacks the faculty of bliss, it is said that its serenity is the causal basis of the fruit of bliss, because both the faculty of bliss and the faculty of joy are called bliss.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c04_7']	言輕安故身受樂者，彌證輕安得名為樂，以輕安起能治身中惛沈品麁重性，令身輕妙安隱受樂。	言輕安故身受樂者，彌證輕安得名為樂，以輕安起能治身中惛沈品麁重性，令身輕妙安隱受樂。	As for the statement that because of serenity one experiences bodily bliss, this further proves that serenity can be called bliss, because when serenity arises it can eliminate the coarse and heavy nature that is dull and heavy in the body, causing the body to experience the bliss of lightness, subtlety, and comfort.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c05_15']	除此樂外必定無餘，是尸羅等次第所得，故對法宗所說無過。	除此樂外必定無餘，是尸羅等次第所得，故對法宗所說無過。	Apart from this bliss, there is definitely no other that is successively obtained from morality, etc. Therefore there is no fault in the explanation of the Abhidharma masters.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c06_1']	今應思擇：	今應思擇：	Now we should consider:
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c07_6']	第三定中意地悅受既得喜相，應名為喜，何故名樂？	第三定中意地悅受既得喜相，應名為喜，何故名樂？	In the third dhyāna, the pleasant feeling in the mental realm has the characteristics of joy. It should be called joy. Why is it called bliss?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c08_4']	此名為樂亦有所因，以諸喜根不寂靜故。	此名為樂亦有所因，以諸喜根不寂靜故。	This is called bliss and also has a reason, because the faculty of joy is not tranquil.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c09_3']	謂喜動涌擾亂定心，如水波濤涌泛漂激。	謂喜動涌擾亂定心，如水波濤涌泛漂激。	This is because joy is agitated, turbulent, and disturbs the concentrated mind, like waves and billows in water that surge, swell, float, and rush.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c10_2']	初二靜慮意地悅受，有如是相故得喜名。	初二靜慮意地悅受，有如是相故得喜名。	In the first two meditations, the feeling of satisfaction in the mind is of this kind, and for that reason it is called joy.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c11_1']	第三定中此心悅受，其相沈靜轉得樂名。	第三定中此心悅受，其相沈靜轉得樂名。	In the third meditation, this feeling of satisfaction in the mind is calm and quiet, and for that reason it is called pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c11_19']	故此定中捨用增上，棄捨喜故立行捨支。	故此定中捨用增上，棄捨喜故立行捨支。	Therefore in this meditation, the faculty of equanimity is dominant, and because one abandons joy, the member of abandoning is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c12_17']	第四定中復棄捨樂，故彼行捨得名清淨。	第四定中復棄捨樂，故彼行捨得名清淨。	In the fourth meditation, one abandons pleasure, and therefore the abandoning of this meditation is said to be pure.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c14_8']	何緣念慧諸地皆有，而念唯在上二靜慮，慧在第三定方得立為支？	何緣念慧諸地皆有，而念唯在上二靜慮，慧在第三定方得立為支？	Why is it that mindfulness and discernment exist in all meditations, but mindfulness is only in the upper two meditations and discernment is established as a member only in the third meditation?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c14_17']	隨其所應偏隨順故。	隨其所應偏隨順故。	Because they assist that meditation, as is appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c15_16']	謂喜與樂於三有中，是諸有情極所耽味。	謂喜與樂於三有中，是諸有情極所耽味。	Joy and pleasure are the most relished flavors for all sentient beings in the three realms of existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c17_5']	第三靜慮所味中極，有生死中最勝樂故，理應立慧觀察厭捨。	第三靜慮所味中極，有生死中最勝樂故，理應立慧觀察厭捨。	In the third meditation, they are relished to the extreme, because there is the most excellent pleasure in birth and death. Therefore it is proper to establish discernment to observe and abandon them.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c18_4']	若無慧者，自地善根尚不能成，況進求勝？	若無慧者，自地善根尚不能成，況進求勝？	If one is without discernment, one cannot even perfect the good roots of one’s own stage, much less progress to seek the superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c19_12']	為治如是自地過失，第三靜慮立慧為支，餘地不然故不立慧。	為治如是自地過失，第三靜慮立慧為支，餘地不然故不立慧。	The third trance state is established as having discernment as a member in order to cure these faults of its own stage. It is not so for the other stages, and therefore discernment is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c20_11']	第二靜慮有最勝喜，輕躁嬈亂如邏剎私。	第二靜慮有最勝喜，輕躁嬈亂如邏剎私。	The second trance state has the most excellent joy, which is fickle and agitates like a rākṣasa.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c21_10']	第三定中有最勝樂，如天妙欲極為難捨。	第三定中有最勝樂，如天妙欲極為難捨。	The third trance state has the most excellent bliss, which is like the most excellent desires of the gods and is extremely difficult to abandon.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c22_17']	第三四定由行捨支，隨其所應雖已棄捨，而恐退起立念遮防；	第三四定由行捨支，隨其所應雖已棄捨，而恐退起立念遮防；	The third and fourth trance states have the member of equanimity in practice. Although one has already abandoned them as appropriate, one establishes mindfulness to prevent their arising in regression.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c23_7']	餘地不然故不立念。	餘地不然故不立念。	It is not so for the other stages, and therefore mindfulness is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c24_15']	然第三念勢用堅強，非唯助捨亦能助慧，通能防備自他地失；	然第三念勢用堅強，非唯助捨亦能助慧，通能防備自他地失；	However, the power of mindfulness in the third trance state is strong. It not only aids equanimity but also aids discernment, and it can generally prevent the faults of its own stage and other stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c25_15']	第四不爾，無自失故，由此第四不立慧支。	第四不爾，無自失故，由此第四不立慧支。	The fourth is not like this, because it has no faults of its own. Consequently, discernment is not established as a member in the fourth.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c26_13']	或初二定尋喜飄動，雖有念慧防照用微；	或初二定尋喜飄動，雖有念慧防照用微；	Or, in the first two trance states, investigation and joy are unstable, and although there is mindfulness and discernment, their function of prevention and illumination is slight.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c28_2']	第四定中二捨所蔽，順無明故慧用不增，故慧唯三、念通上二。	第四定中二捨所蔽，順無明故慧用不增，故慧唯三、念通上二。	In the fourth trance state, the two kinds of equanimity obscure it, and it accords with ignorance, and therefore the function of discernment does not increase. Consequently, discernment is only in three, and mindfulness is in the upper two.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0761c29_18']	或第三定樂過甚微，不立慧支無能照察，若不照察則無厭求自地過患上地功德。	或第三定樂過甚微，不立慧支無能照察，若不照察則無厭求自地過患上地功德。	Or, the pleasure of the third trance is so subtle that it does not establish the member of discernment and wisdom, because there is no ability to investigate and discern. If there is no investigation and discernment, then there is no disgust with the faults of one’s own stage and seeking of the virtues of the higher stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a02_7']	然下尋喜上色過麁，雖照厭求未為奇特，故餘三地慧不立支。	然下尋喜上色過麁，雖照厭求未為奇特，故餘三地慧不立支。	However, the faults of the lower stages of seeking and joy and the higher stage of form are gross. Even though one investigates and is disgusted, it is not considered extraordinary. Therefore the other three stages do not establish members of discernment.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a03_8']	以第三定中，樂過難覺故，佛說聖者應說應知。	以第三定中，樂過難覺故，佛說聖者應說應知。	Because the faults of pleasure in the third trance are difficult to perceive, the Buddha said that the saints should explain and know them.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a04_7']	由此定中慧用最勝，能知細過故立為支。	由此定中慧用最勝，能知細過故立為支。	Consequently, the function of discernment in this trance is most excellent, because it can know subtle faults, and for that reason it is established as a member.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a05_6']	雖第四邊慧亦能了，而但總相未為奇特。	雖第四邊慧亦能了，而但總相未為奇特。	Even though discernment at the edge of the fourth trance can also understand, it is only a general characteristic and is not considered extraordinary.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a07_9']	謂彼與樂繫地不同，是離染道總觀下過，非如自慧同一繫縛，能別觀失方謂希奇，故自立支。	謂彼與樂繫地不同，是離染道總觀下過，非如自慧同一繫縛，能別觀失方謂希奇，故自立支。	That is, it is not the same as the member of pleasure, and it is the path of separation from passions that generally contemplates the faults of the lower stages, not like the discernment of one’s own stage that is the same as that which binds one, and is able to specifically contemplate faults and is considered extraordinary. Therefore it is established as a member.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a07_14']	上慧不爾。	上慧不爾。	The higher discernment is not like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a10_2']	又諸已得第三靜慮，於第四邊非皆自在，故於將離樂受染時，彼慧無容立為支體，故唯三定立慧為支。	又諸已得第三靜慮，於第四邊非皆自在，故於將離樂受染時，彼慧無容立為支體，故唯三定立慧為支。	Also, those who have already attained the third trance are not all masters of the fourth trance. Therefore, when they are about to be separated from the passion of the feeling of pleasure, it is impossible for them to establish wisdom as a member of the trance. Therefore, only the three trances establish wisdom as a member.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a11_1']	然正了時及初已離，皆應防守須立念支。	然正了時及初已離，皆應防守須立念支。	However, when one is correctly understanding and has already been separated from the feeling of pleasure, one must guard oneself. Therefore, one must establish mindfulness as a member.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a11_10']	何故輕安立為支體？	何故輕安立為支體？	Why is serenity established as a member?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a14_6']	以初二定輕安用增，觸前所無殊勝位故，由此勢用精勤不捨，能令相續有所堪能，能助等持令牽勝德，有殊勝用故立為支。	以初二定輕安用增，觸前所無殊勝位故，由此勢用精勤不捨，能令相續有所堪能，能助等持令牽勝德，有殊勝用故立為支。	Because in the first two trances, the function of serenity is increased, and it is not found in the previous stages. Because of this, one’s efforts are not abandoned, and one is able to make the continuity of mind capable of something. It is able to assist samādhi and cause it to attract excellent qualities. Because it has a superior function, it is established as a member.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a14_15']	內等淨名為目何法？	內等淨名為目何法？	What is the name of the thing called internal purity?
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a15_6']	目尋伺息、於定心堅。	目尋伺息、於定心堅。	It is the steadiness of the mind in samādhi, with the cessation of applied and sustained thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a15_9']	有說：	有說：	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0762a17_5']	先時尋伺鼓動令心於境不甚堅牢，今於所緣方能一趣，故說內等淨目於定心堅；	先時尋伺鼓動令心於境不甚堅牢，今於所緣方能一趣，故說內等淨目於定心堅；	Previously, applied and sustained thought agitated the mind and caused it not to be very steady with regard to the object. Now, it is able to be unified with regard to the object. Therefore, it is said that internal purity is the steadiness of the mind in samādhi.

['ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c19_15']	非此近分乘先定起，又非住此已起愛味，依如是義立未至名。	非此近分乘先定起，又非住此已起愛味，依如是義立未至名。	This preliminary stage is not the support for the arising of craving, because it is not the support for the arising of the prior samādhi, nor is it the support for the arising of craving while one is abiding in it. On the basis of these meanings, it is called the preliminary stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c21_4', 'ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c21_13']	非上定邊亦名未至，皆乘先定勢力引生，及住彼時已起味故。🔽毘婆沙者作如是說：	非上定邊亦名未至，皆乘先定勢力引生，及住彼時已起味故。 毘婆沙者作如是說：	The preliminary stages of the higher samādhis are not called the preliminary stage of the first trance state, because they are the support for the arising of the prior samādhi, and while one is abiding in them, one has already given rise to craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c22_12']	未至本地立未至名，是本地德未現前義。	未至本地立未至名，是本地德未現前義。	The Vaibhāṣikas say that the preliminary stage of the basic stage is called the preliminary stage, because the qualities of the basic stage are not yet manifest.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c23_11']	此中間定具味等三，以別繫屬一生處故。	此中間定具味等三，以別繫屬一生處故。	This intermediate samādhi is provided with the three, such as craving, because it is associated with a single destiny.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c25_8']	謂極修習中間定者，未來當在大梵處生，故亦具三如根本定，非根本地起愛貪彼。	謂極修習中間定者，未來當在大梵處生，故亦具三如根本定，非根本地起愛貪彼。	That is, one who cultivates the intermediate samādhi to a high degree will be reborn in the future in the abode of Mahābrahmā, and therefore it is also provided with the three, such as craving, like the basic samādhi. One does not give rise to craving for that abode of Mahābrahmā, because it is a basic stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c27_1']	如所味有別，能味亦別故，此有勝德可愛味故，無漏定生亦漸減故。	如所味有別，能味亦別故，此有勝德可愛味故，無漏定生亦漸減故。	Because the flavors are different, the experiencers must also be different. This has superior qualities and is lovable, and because it is born from pure concentration, it also gradually decreases.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0765c28_8']	此亦一向捨受相應，無三識身故無樂受，無喜受者已不共初。	此亦一向捨受相應，無三識身故無樂受，無喜受者已不共初。	This is also associated with the feeling of equanimity, because there are no three kinds of consciousness, there is no feeling of pleasure. There is no feeling of joy, because it is not shared with the first.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0766a01_6']	然於初貪未能離故，又由自勉功用轉故，由此說為苦通行攝，非憂苦者已出欲故。	然於初貪未能離故，又由自勉功用轉故，由此說為苦通行攝，非憂苦者已出欲故。	However, because one is not yet able to be free from craving in the first, and because it arises from one's own effort and exertion, therefore it is said to be included in the practice of the path of suffering, not of sorrow or suffering, because one has already left desire.
['ZH_T29_1562_078:0766a02_14']	由此一向捨受相應，此定能招大梵處果，多修習者為大梵故。	由此一向捨受相應，此定能招大梵處果，多修習者為大梵故。	Therefore it is associated with the feeling of equanimity. This concentration can bring about the fruit of the state of Great Brahmā, because one who cultivates it extensively becomes Great Brahmā.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
