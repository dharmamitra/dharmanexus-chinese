['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a11_2']	第一述大意者，夫一心之源離有無而獨淨、三空之海融真俗而湛然，湛然融二而不一、獨淨離邊而非中，非中而離邊故，不有之法不即住無、不無之相不即住有；	第一述大意者，夫一心之源離有無而獨淨、三空之海融真俗而湛然，湛然融二而不一、獨淨離邊而非中，非中而離邊故，不有之法不即住無、不無之相不即住有；	001	The first, stating the general meaning, is as follows: The source of the one mind is apart from existence and non-existence, yet uniquely pure; the ocean of the three emptinesses melts true and conventional into a state of tranquil stillness. Tranquil stillness melts the two without being one; unique purity is apart from extremes and yet not the middle. Not being the middle and yet apart from extremes, therefore the dharma of non-existence does not abide in non-existence, and the characteristics of non-existence do not abide in existence.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a12_8']	不一而融二故，非真之事未始為俗、非俗之理未始為真也。	不一而融二故，非真之事未始為俗、非俗之理未始為真也。	001	Not being one and yet melting the two, therefore the affairs of truth have never been conventional, and the principle of conventionality has never been true.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a13_14']	融二而不一故，真俗之性無所不立、染淨之相莫不備焉；	融二而不一故，真俗之性無所不立、染淨之相莫不備焉；	001	Melting the two without being one, therefore the nature of truth and conventionality is established everywhere, and the characteristics of defilement and purity are all complete.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a15_1']	離邊而非中故，有無之法無所不作、是非之義莫不周焉。	離邊而非中故，有無之法無所不作、是非之義莫不周焉。	001	Being apart from extremes and yet not the middle, therefore the dharmas of existence and non-existence are created everywhere, and the meanings of right and wrong are all-encompassing.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a16_12']	爾乃無破而無不破、無立而無不立，可謂無理之至理、不然之大然矣。	爾乃無破而無不破、無立而無不立，可謂無理之至理、不然之大然矣。	001	Only then can it be said to be the ultimate truth without reasoning, the great truth without establishment.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a17_2']	是謂斯經之大意也。	是謂斯經之大意也。	001	This is called the great meaning of this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a18_1']	良由不然之大然故，能說之語妙契環中；	良由不然之大然故，能說之語妙契環中；	001	It is precisely because of the great truth without establishment that the wonderful words of the speaker perfectly accord with the center;
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a18_17']	無理之至理故，所詮之宗超出方外。	無理之至理故，所詮之宗超出方外。	001	Because of the ultimate truth without reasoning, the principle expounded transcends the ordinary world.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a19_9']	無所不破，故名金剛三昧；	無所不破，故名金剛三昧；	001	Since there is nothing that is not destroyed, it is called the vajra samādhi;
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a20_1']	無所不立，故名攝大乘經。	無所不立，故名攝大乘經。	001	Since there is nothing that is not established, it is called the Mahāyāna-samgraha Sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a20_19']	一切義宗無出是二，是故亦名無量義宗。	一切義宗無出是二，是故亦名無量義宗。	001	All principles and doctrines do not go beyond these two, therefore it is also called the principle of immeasurable meanings.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a21_17']	且舉一目以題其首，故言金剛三昧經也。	且舉一目以題其首，故言金剛三昧經也。	001	Merely raising one eye to title it, therefore it is called the Vajra Samādhi Sūtra.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a23_8']	合而言之，一味觀行為要；	合而言之，一味觀行為要；	001	Speaking of it in a combined way, the practice of one-flavored contemplation is essential;

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a24_14']	言觀行者，觀是橫論，通於境智；	言觀行者，觀是橫論，通於境智；	001	As for the practitioner of contemplation, contemplation is a horizontal discussion that encompasses both objects and wisdom;
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a25_3']	行是竪望，亘其因果。	行是竪望，亘其因果。	001	practice is a vertical perspective that spans its causes and effects.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a26_11']	果謂五法圓滿、因謂六行備足，智即本始兩覺、境即真俗雙泯。	果謂五法圓滿、因謂六行備足，智即本始兩覺、境即真俗雙泯。	001	The effect refers to the perfection of the five dharmas, and the cause refers to the completeness of the six practices. Wisdom is the two kinds of enlightenment, fundamental and initial, and the object is the simultaneous negation of both the true and conventional.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a28_2']	雙泯而不滅，兩覺而無生，無生之行冥會無相，無相之法順成本利。	雙泯而不滅，兩覺而無生，無生之行冥會無相，無相之法順成本利。	001	Negating both without annihilation, and being enlightened without arising, the practice of non-arising mysteriously accords with the signless. The signless Dharma conforms to the fundamental benefit.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a28_17']	利既是本利，而無得故不動實際；	利既是本利，而無得故不動實際；	001	Since the benefit is already the fundamental benefit, there is no attainment, and therefore it does not move from the actual reality.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961a29_12']	際既是實際，而離性故真際亦空。	際既是實際，而離性故真際亦空。	001	Since the actual reality is already the actual reality, it is free from nature, and therefore the true reality is also empty.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961b02_10']	諸佛如來於焉而藏、一切菩薩於中隨入，如是名為入如來藏，是為六品之大意也。	諸佛如來於焉而藏、一切菩薩於中隨入，如是名為入如來藏，是為六品之大意也。	001	The buddhas and tathāgatas hide here, and all bodhisattvas enter it accordingly. This is called entering the tathāgatagarbha. This is the general idea of the six chapters.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961b03_8']	於此觀門，從初信解乃至等覺立為六行。	於此觀門，從初信解乃至等覺立為六行。	001	In this contemplation method, from initial faith and understanding up to equal enlightenment, it is established as the six practices.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961b04_16']	六行滿時九識轉顯，顯無垢識為淨法界，轉餘八識而成四智。	六行滿時九識轉顯，顯無垢識為淨法界，轉餘八識而成四智。	001	When the six practices are fulfilled, the nine consciousnesses transform and manifest. The undefiled consciousness manifests as the pure Dharma realm, and the remaining eight consciousnesses transform into the four wisdoms.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961b06_5']	五法既圓、三身斯備，如是因果不離境智，境智無二唯是一味。	五法既圓、三身斯備，如是因果不離境智，境智無二唯是一味。	001	When the five dharmas are complete and the three bodies are fully present, such causes and effects are inseparable from the objective realm and wisdom. The objective realm and wisdom are non-dual, only of a single flavor.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961b06_18']	如是一味觀行以為此經宗也。	如是一味觀行以為此經宗也。	001	Such a single-flavored contemplation practice is the main theme of this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961b08_11']	所以大乘法相無所不攝，無量義宗莫不入之，名不虛稱，斯之謂歟。	所以大乘法相無所不攝，無量義宗莫不入之，名不虛稱，斯之謂歟。	001	Therefore, the characteristics of Mahayana dharmas are all-encompassing, and the main points of immeasurable meanings are all included within it.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0961b20_3']	五門者，於五陰生具五十惡，故植五根而養五力，涉五空海跋五等位，得五淨法、度五道生，如是等也。	五門者，於五陰生具五十惡，故植五根而養五力，涉五空海跋五等位，得五淨法、度五道生，如是等也。	001	The five gates are: in the five aggregates, giving rise to fifty evils, therefore planting the five faculties and nourishing the five powers, traversing the five empty seas and ascending the five equal positions, attaining the five pure dharmas and crossing the five destinies, such as these.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0962c17_16']	二者心一境性及三昧名此二次寬，雖通欲界，不通一向散亂心中，以般舟三昧或欲界繫九種心住心一境性亦通欲界方便心故。	二者心一境性及三昧名此二次寬，雖通欲界，不通一向散亂心中，以般舟三昧或欲界繫九種心住心一境性亦通欲界方便心故。	001	Second, the name of one-pointedness of mind and samādhi are the next two widest. Although they are common to the desire realm, they are not common to the distracted mind, because the nine kinds of mind abiding in the samādhi of the practice of walking or the one-pointedness of mind in the desire realm are also common to the desire realm expedient mind.

Śamatha does not include the one-pointedness of mind in the four kinds of mental activities of insight, and samādhi does not include the three samādhis of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c09_1']	一〈無相法品〉明無相觀、二〈無生行品〉顯無生行、三〈本覺剎品〉依本利物、四〈入實際品〉從虛入實、五〈真性空品〉辨一切行出真性空、六〈如來藏品〉顯無量門入如來藏，如是六門觀行周盡。	一〈無相法品〉明無相觀、二〈無生行品〉顯無生行、三〈本覺剎品〉依本利物、四〈入實際品〉從虛入實、五〈真性空品〉辨一切行出真性空、六〈如來藏品〉顯無量門入如來藏，如是六門觀行周盡。	001	The first, the chapter on the Dharma of No-characteristics, clarifies the contemplation of no-characteristics. The second, the chapter on the practice of no-arising, reveals the practice of no-arising. The third, the chapter on the land of original enlightenment, relies on the fundamental to benefit beings. The fourth, the chapter on entering ultimate reality, enters emptiness from falsehood. The fifth, the chapter on the emptiness of true nature, distinguishes all practices that arise from the emptiness of true nature. The sixth, the chapter on the womb of the Tathāgata, reveals the immeasurable gates that enter the womb of the Tathāgata. In this way, the six gates completely encompass the contemplations and practices.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c09_6']	所以然者？	所以然者？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c10_4']	凡諸妄想無始流轉，只由取相分別之患。	凡諸妄想無始流轉，只由取相分別之患。	001	All deluded thoughts have flowed on since beginningless time, only due to the affliction of grasping at characteristics and discrimination.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c11_7']	今欲反流歸源，先須破遣諸相，所以初明觀無相法。	今欲反流歸源，先須破遣諸相，所以初明觀無相法。	001	Now, wishing to reverse the flow and return to the source, one must first eliminate all characteristics. Therefore, the first clarifies the contemplation of the Dharma of no-characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c13_1']	雖遣諸相，若存觀心，觀心猶生不會本覺，故泯生心，所以第二顯無生行。	雖遣諸相，若存觀心，觀心猶生不會本覺，故泯生心，所以第二顯無生行。	001	Although eliminating all characteristics, if one still retains the contemplating mind, the contemplating mind will still arise and one will not accord with original enlightenment. Therefore, the second reveals the practice of no-arising, obliterating the arising mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c14_8']	行既無生方會本覺，依此化物令得本利，故第三明本覺利門。	行既無生方會本覺，依此化物令得本利，故第三明本覺利門。	001	Since practice is unborn, it accords with original enlightenment. Relying on this to transform beings, enabling them to attain their original benefit, therefore the third clarifies the gate of the benefit of original enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c15_16']	若依本覺以利眾生，眾生即能從虛入實，所以第四明入實際。	若依本覺以利眾生，眾生即能從虛入實，所以第四明入實際。	001	If one relies on original enlightenment to benefit sentient beings, sentient beings will then be able to enter emptiness and reality. Therefore the fourth clarifies entering ultimate reality.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c18_2']	內行即無相無生，外化即本利入實，如是二利以具萬行，同出真性、皆順真空，是故第五明真性空。	內行即無相無生，外化即本利入實，如是二利以具萬行，同出真性、皆順真空，是故第五明真性空。	001	Inner practice is signless and unborn, outer transformation is original benefit and entering reality. Such two benefits are endowed with myriad practices, equally emerging from true nature, all in accord with true emptiness. Therefore the fifth clarifies true nature and emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c19_10']	依此真性萬行斯備，入如來藏一味之源，所以第六顯如來藏。	依此真性萬行斯備，入如來藏一味之源，所以第六顯如來藏。	001	Relying on this true nature, myriad practices are complete, entering the source of the single flavor of the Tathāgatagarbha. Therefore the sixth reveals the Tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c20_17']	既歸心源即無所為，無所為故無所不為，故說六門以攝大乘。	既歸心源即無所為，無所為故無所不為，故說六門以攝大乘。	001	Since one returns to the source of the mind, there is nothing to do. Since there is nothing to do, there is nothing that is not done. Therefore the six gates are taught to encompass the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c22_5']	又此六品亦有異意，謂初品示所觀之法，法謂一心如來藏體；	又此六品亦有異意，謂初品示所觀之法，法謂一心如來藏體；	001	Moreover, these six chapters also have different meanings. That is to say, the first chapter demonstrates the Dharma to be contemplated. The Dharma refers to the essence of the Tathāgatagarbha of the one mind;
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c23_4']	第二品明能觀之行，行謂六行無分別觀；	第二品明能觀之行，行謂六行無分別觀；	001	The second chapter clarifies the practice of the observer, which refers to the six practices of non-discriminating observation.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c24_1']	第三〈本覺利品〉顯一心中之生滅門；	第三〈本覺利品〉顯一心中之生滅門；	001	The third chapter on the benefits of original enlightenment reveals the arising and ceasing aspect within a single mind.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0963c29_2']	又此六品合為三門，前二品攝觀行始終，次二品者教化本末，其後二門攝因成果。	又此六品合為三門，前二品攝觀行始終，次二品者教化本末，其後二門攝因成果。	001	Moreover, these six chapters can be combined into three aspects: the first two chapters encompass the beginning and end of contemplative practice, the next two chapters are the basis and conclusion of teaching and transforming, and the last two chapters include the fruition of cultivating causes.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0964a01_10']	又前二品遣相歸本，中間二品從本起行，後二品者雙顯歸起。	又前二品遣相歸本，中間二品從本起行，後二品者雙顯歸起。	001	Furthermore, the first two chapters negate characteristics and return to the basis, the middle two chapters arise from the basis and give rise to practice, and the last two chapters both reveal the return and arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0964a01_19']	以此二三攝大乘盡。	以此二三攝大乘盡。	001	These two and three aspects exhaustively encompass the Great Vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0964a04_6']	又前門者遣妄顯因，其後門者顯真成果。	又前門者遣妄顯因，其後門者顯真成果。	001	Moreover, the former gate eliminates delusion to reveal the cause, while the latter gate reveals the true to manifest the result.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0964a05_15']	所以然者？	所以然者？	001	The reason for this is as follows:
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0964a07_3']	相生無性、本覺無本、實際離際、真性亦空，何由得有如來藏性？	相生無性、本覺無本、實際離際、真性亦空，何由得有如來藏性？	001	Arising characteristics have no nature, original enlightenment has no basis, the true suchness of emptiness is devoid of limits, and the true nature is also empty. How can there then be the nature of the tathāgatagarbha?
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0964a08_4']	如下〈如來藏品〉中言「是識常寂滅，寂滅亦寂滅。	如下〈如來藏品〉中言「是識常寂滅，寂滅亦寂滅。	001	As stated in the Tathāgatagarbha Chapter, This consciousness is eternally quiescent and extinct, and extinction is also extinct.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966b01_7']	所入空寂即是一心，一切所依名之為地，故言即入空寂空寂心地。	所入空寂即是一心，一切所依名之為地，故言即入空寂空寂心地。	001	The empty quiescence that is entered is precisely the one mind. All that is relied upon is called the ground, and therefore it is said to enter the empty quiescent mind ground.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966b03_5']	雖諸眾生本來流轉恒取有相，然依此門推求觀察，即能得本空心，故言即得心空。	雖諸眾生本來流轉恒取有相，然依此門推求觀察，即能得本空心，故言即得心空。	001	Although all sentient beings originally flow and turn, always grasping at characteristics, yet relying on this gate to investigate and observe, one is able to obtain the originally empty mind, and therefore it is said to immediately obtain the empty mind.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966b04_4']	心空空心語有左右，只是一心本覺之義。	心空空心語有左右，只是一心本覺之義。	001	The mind being empty and the mind being empty are words with left and right [meanings], but they are just the meaning of the fundamentally enlightened mind.

All dharma characteristics are also like this. This reiterates emptiness and quiescence.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966b09_4']	非直離此心我二相，其餘一切有為無為乃至有上無上等相無相心中無不離故。	非直離此心我二相，其餘一切有為無為乃至有上無上等相無相心中無不離故。	001	Not only is one apart from these two characteristics of mind and self, but also apart from all other characteristics, such as conditioned and unconditioned, and even superior and non-superior, in the mind without characteristics.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966b24_1']	二觀無常緣生，治常住執，如說是事生故是事生。	二觀無常緣生，治常住執，如說是事生故是事生。	001	Second, observing impermanent dependent origination treats the attachment to permanence, as it is said, Because this arises, that arises.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c01_4']	況治中言本從因果者，從總出別。	況治中言本從因果者，從總出別。	001	In treating by analogy, it says originally arising from causes and effects. It goes from the general to the specific.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c01_13']	總而言之唯因與果。	總而言之唯因與果。	001	In general, it is only causes and effects.

The arising of cause and effect is based on mental activity. The mind can create causes and the mind experiences effects, so how much more so is there a person when the mind itself does not exist?

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c10_12']	已說況破。	已說況破。	001	The above has explained the refutation by implication.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c21_2']	若存心生而成病者，破前滅性，要依彼滅存今生故。	若存心生而成病者，破前滅性，要依彼滅存今生故。	001	If the existence of the mind arises and becomes an illness, the previous nature of cessation is eliminated. It is necessary to rely on that cessation to preserve the present arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c23_1']	若見後滅執有現心，心設不滅如兔角故，破如是見令滅生性，無生有滅不應理故。	若見後滅執有現心，心設不滅如兔角故，破如是見令滅生性，無生有滅不應理故。	001	If one sees that the subsequent cessation exists in the present mind, even if the mind does not cease, it is like a rabbit's horns. Therefore, this view is refuted. It is unreasonable for there to be cessation without arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c25_3']	滅是見性即入實際者，破見滅性必不取生，破見生性必不取滅，不取生滅必不存心故。	滅是見性即入實際者，破見滅性必不取生，破見生性必不取滅，不取生滅必不存心故。	001	The nature of cessation is seen to be the actual reality means that the nature of cessation is refuted, and one definitely does not grasp arising. The nature of arising is refuted, and one definitely does not grasp cessation. One definitely does not grasp arising or cessation, and therefore the mind does not exist.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c26_7']	經曰　「何以故？	經曰　「何以故？	001	The sūtra says: Why is it so?

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0966c29_8']	故言何以故。	故言何以故。	001	Therefore it says why is it so?

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0967a03_3']	如是不存前心滅性，即不得取今心之生，故言不滅不生。	如是不存前心滅性，即不得取今心之生，故言不滅不生。	001	If the previous mind's nature of cessation is not present in this way, then the arising of the present mind cannot be grasped, so it is said there is no cessation and no arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0967a03_12']	是釋令滅滅性之由。	是釋令滅滅性之由。	001	This explains the reason for the cessation of the nature of cessation.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0967a05_14']	如是不得今心生性，則不得取此心之滅，故言不生不滅。	如是不得今心生性，則不得取此心之滅，故言不生不滅。	001	In this way, if the nature of arising of the present mind is not obtained, then the cessation of this mind cannot be grasped, so it is said there is no arising and no cessation.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0967a06_4']	是釋令滅生性之由。	是釋令滅生性之由。	001	This explains the reason for the cessation of the nature of arising.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0967a07_12']	如於心法無滅無生，其餘諸法亦同是觀，故言一切法亦如是。	如於心法無滅無生，其餘諸法亦同是觀，故言一切法亦如是。	001	Just as there is no cessation and no arising in the mind and dharmas, the other dharmas are also observed in the same way, so it is said all dharmas are also like this.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0967a11_11']	依此次第破今生性，由是即遣後滅之執，是謂醫王善巧之術耶。	依此次第破今生性，由是即遣後滅之執，是謂醫王善巧之術耶。	001	Based on this sequence, the nature of the present life is refuted, and thus the attachment to later cessation is eliminated. Is this not the skillful method of the medical king?

Yet there is the deluded mind, unaware, giving rise to thoughts and seeing various objects. Therefore it is said to be ignorance. The nature of the mind not arising is the meaning of great wisdom and bright light.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970a09_17']	若心有動，非真識知無有自性，非常非樂非我非淨，乃至具足過恒沙等妄染之義。	若心有動，非真識知無有自性，非常非樂非我非淨，乃至具足過恒沙等妄染之義。	001	If the mind has movement, it is not true cognition, lacks self-nature, is not constant, blissful, self, or pure, and even possesses the meaning of delusions and defilements exceeding the sands of the Ganges.

Because the mind has movement, it is not true cognition and awareness, and it does not have self-nature, permanence, bliss, self, purity, and so forth. Therefore, it is called movement.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970a25_17']	即無生滅者，由前思慮有生滅相，今無思慮永無分別，二種生滅究竟離故。	即無生滅者，由前思慮有生滅相，今無思慮永無分別，二種生滅究竟離故。	001	If there is no arising and ceasing, it is because the previous thought and deliberation have the characteristics of arising and ceasing, but now without thought and deliberation, there is forever no discrimination, and the two kinds of arising and ceasing are ultimately abandoned.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970a27_4']	從此已去順理不動，窮未來際不復還動，故言如實不起。	從此已去順理不動，窮未來際不復還動，故言如實不起。	001	From here on, one accords with principle and does not move, exhausting the future without ever moving back again, thus it is said truly does not arise.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970a29_4']	二種生滅究竟息時，八種識動皆得歸靜，六染流注永滅不起，故言諸識安寂流注不生。	二種生滅究竟息時，八種識動皆得歸靜，六染流注永滅不起，故言諸識安寂流注不生。	001	When the two kinds of arising and ceasing ultimately cease, the movement of the eight kinds of consciousness all returns to stillness, and the six defiled continuums are forever extinguished and do not arise again, thus it is said the various consciousnesses are peacefully still and their continuums do not arise.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970b01_12']	流注不生故法界圓顯，諸識安寂故四智滿成，故言得五法淨。	流注不生故法界圓顯，諸識安寂故四智滿成，故言得五法淨。	001	Because the continuums do not arise, the perfect dharma realm is revealed, and because the various consciousnesses are peacefully still, the four kinds of wisdom are fulfilled, thus it is said attains the purity of the five dharmas.

If there is no delusion, one immediately enters the ground of the Tathāgata's self-realized holy wisdom. Those who enter the ground of wisdom well know that all things originally do not arise. Knowing the original non-arising, there is immediately no delusion.

['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970b08_10']	初言入五法淨心即無妄者，歸心源時即無妄念之不覺故。	初言入五法淨心即無妄者，歸心源時即無妄念之不覺故。	001	The first says Entering the five dharmas, the pure mind is immediately without delusion because when the mind returns to its source, there are immediately no deluded thoughts of non-awakening.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970b10_17']	第二言若無有妄即入如來自覺聖智之地者，不覺盡時即入始覺圓智之地故，是對不覺顯始覺滿也。	第二言若無有妄即入如來自覺聖智之地者，不覺盡時即入始覺圓智之地故，是對不覺顯始覺滿也。	001	The second says If there is no delusion, one immediately enters the ground of the Tathāgata's self-realized holy wisdom because when non-awakening is exhausted, one immediately enters the ground of perfect, original awakening. This is the manifestation of perfect original awakening in contrast to non-awakening.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970b14_3']	第三入智地者善知一切從本不生，知本不生即無妄想者，始覺滿時能知不覺四相動念本來不生，即知本來無妄想故，是顯始覺不異本覺也。	第三入智地者善知一切從本不生，知本不生即無妄想者，始覺滿時能知不覺四相動念本來不生，即知本來無妄想故，是顯始覺不異本覺也。	001	As for the third, entering the stage of wisdom, it means skillfully knowing that everything is originally unborn. Knowing the original non-arising is precisely the absence of deluded thoughts. When the initial awakening is complete, one can know that the four characteristics of non-awakening and the moving thoughts are originally unborn, and thus know that there have originally been no deluded thoughts. This reveals that the initial awakening is no different from the original awakening.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970b15_18']	如《起信論》云「一切眾生不名為覺，以從本來念念相續未曾離念，故說無始無明。	如《起信論》云「一切眾生不名為覺，以從本來念念相續未曾離念，故說無始無明。	001	As the Awakening of Faith says, All sentient beings are not called awakened, because from the very beginning they have been in a continuous succession of thoughts and have never been apart from thoughts. Therefore it is said that there is beginningless ignorance.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970b16_14']	若得無念者，即知心相生住異滅。	若得無念者，即知心相生住異滅。	001	If one attains no-thought, then one will know the arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing of the mind's characteristics.

Originally equal, they are all the same as the one awakening.

This reveals the meaning in the sutra of skillfully knowing everything.
['ZH_T34_1730_001:0970b21_7']	而實無有始覺之異者，即顯經中善知從本不生也。	而實無有始覺之異者，即顯經中善知從本不生也。	001	Yet there is actually no difference in the initial enlightenment, which reveals in the sutra well knowing the non-arising from the beginning.

Because there is nothing to cease, the ability to cease also does not exist. Because there is no ability to cease, there should be no initial enlightenment.
