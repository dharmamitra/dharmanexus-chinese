['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873a25_11']	二智者，即是如量、如理智。	二智者，即是如量、如理智。	The two kinds of wisdom refer to the wisdom of knowing things as they are and the wisdom of knowing things in their full extent.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873a26_10']	此智是無流、過凡夫故可讚，出二乘故最極；	此智是無流、過凡夫故可讚，出二乘故最極；	This wisdom is praiseworthy because it is undefiled and surpasses that of ordinary beings, and it is ultimate because it transcends that of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873a27_6']	又是菩薩智故可讚，是佛智故最極。	又是菩薩智故可讚，是佛智故最極。	Moreover, it is praiseworthy because it is the wisdom of bodhisattvas, and it is ultimate because it is the wisdom of buddhas.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873a28_1']	此顯無倒義，是無倒智境界故。	此顯無倒義，是無倒智境界故。	This shows the meaning of non-error, because it is the object of non-erroneous wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873a28_12']	復次無戲論故名為真實。	復次無戲論故名為真實。	Moreover, it is called true reality because it is free from conceptual proliferation.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873a29_7']	無戲論者，於相等離一異虛妄故。	無戲論者，於相等離一異虛妄故。	As for being free from conceptual proliferation, it is because the characteristics, etc., are free from the false notions of identity and difference.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b01_14']	相等者，謂相名分別，正智等四攝，即是五法藏中四法藏也。	相等者，謂相名分別，正智等四攝，即是五法藏中四法藏也。	The characteristics, etc., refer to the four categories of characteristics, names, discrimination, and right knowledge, which are the four dharma-aggregates among the five dharma-aggregates.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b02_3']	云何不可說一異？	云何不可說一異？	Why are they said to be inexpressible in terms of identity and difference?

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b03_13']	一者此真如則非相等實體；	一者此真如則非相等實體；	First, this suchness is not the real substance of characteristics, etc.;

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b05_17']	三者覺真如已則應未達相等諸法，不相關故也。	三者覺真如已則應未達相等諸法，不相關故也。	Third, having realized suchness, one should not yet have penetrated characteristics, etc., because they are not related.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b06_13']	若真如與相等是一，亦有三過：	若真如與相等是一，亦有三過：	If suchness and characteristics, etc. are the same, there are also three faults:
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b07_12']	一者真如既無差別，相等亦應無有差別；	一者真如既無差別，相等亦應無有差別；	First, since suchness is without distinction, characteristics, etc. should also be without distinction;
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b08_4']	二者若見相等即見真如；	二者若見相等即見真如；	Second, if one sees characteristics, etc., one should see suchness;
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b10_1']	三者若見真如不能清淨如見相等，則無有聖人、無得解脫、無有涅槃、世出世異。	三者若見真如不能清淨如見相等，則無有聖人、無得解脫、無有涅槃、世出世異。	Third, if seeing suchness cannot purify one as seeing characteristics, etc., then there would be no sages, no attainment of liberation, no nirvana, and no difference between the mundane and supramundane.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b11_8']	是故由離一異等或戲論故無變異，無變異故即是真實性也。	是故由離一異等或戲論故無變異，無變異故即是真實性也。	Therefore, because it is free from the conceptual proliferation of sameness, difference, etc., it is unchanging. Because it is unchanging, it is the true nature.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b14_12']	相結成真實故。	相結成真實故。	Because the characteristics are formed into the truth.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b15_1']	是故不得無此性也。	是故不得無此性也。	Therefore, this nature cannot be said to be non-existent.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b16_4']	一切種即如理、如量智，相結即是分別性、依他性也。	一切種即如理、如量智，相結即是分別性、依他性也。	All kinds refer to the wisdom that accords with principle and accords with phenomena, and the characteristics are the discriminating nature and the dependent nature.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b16_18']	復次此性實有，由清淨境界故。	復次此性實有，由清淨境界故。	Furthermore, this nature truly exists because it is the pure object.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b17_13']	若心緣此境即得清淨故。	若心緣此境即得清淨故。	Because if the mind takes this object, it attains purity.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b19_11']	復次此性實有故名常住，清淨境界故名為善，常住故名為樂，真實無性故說無性。	復次此性實有故名常住，清淨境界故名為善，常住故名為樂，真實無性故說無性。	Furthermore, this nature truly exists, therefore it is called permanent, it is called good because it is the pure object, it is called blissful because it is permanent, and it is said to be natureless because it is truly without nature.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b19_15']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b20_8']	此性是一切戲論法真實體性故。	此性是一切戲論法真實體性故。	Because this nature is the true nature of all conceptual dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b20_19']	離有離無，故名無真性。	離有離無，故名無真性。	It is called natureless because it is apart from existence and apart from non-existence.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b24_16']	體是真實，是無性故。	體是真實，是無性故。	The essence is true, because it is the nature of non-nature.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b25_18']	若於依他、分別兩性中，則但得說無性，不得說真實。	若於依他、分別兩性中，則但得說無性，不得說真實。	If within the two natures of the dependent and the discriminated, then one can only speak of the nature of non-nature, and cannot speak of the true.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b26_19']	分別、依他非真實，故兩體是無性。	分別、依他非真實，故兩體是無性。	The two essences of the discriminated and the dependent are not true, so they are the nature of non-nature.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b27_15']	若不無性，則分別、依他成真實有。	若不無性，則分別、依他成真實有。	If they were not the nature of non-nature, then the discriminated and the dependent would be truly existent.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b29_7']	若說分別、依他是真實，則無無性義，是故不得具說真實、無性兩義也。	若說分別、依他是真實，則無無性義，是故不得具說真實、無性兩義也。	If it is said that the discriminated and the dependent are the true, then there would be no meaning of the nature of non-nature, and therefore one cannot fully speak of both the true and the nature of non-nature.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873b29_19']	若說無性真實性，義可然；	若說無性真實性，義可然；	If it is said that the nature of non-nature is the true nature, the meaning is reasonable;
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c02_8']	若說依他、分別真實無性，此即不可，真實之名濫分別、依他故。	若說依他、分別真實無性，此即不可，真實之名濫分別、依他故。	If it is said that the other-dependent and imagined natures are without reality, this is not acceptable, because the name reality would be confused with the imagined and other-dependent natures.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c04_3']	經中說有五相，一名言相、二所言相、三名義相、四執著相、五非執著相。	經中說有五相，一名言相、二所言相、三名義相、四執著相、五非執著相。	The sūtras speak of five characteristics: 1) the characteristic of names, 2) the characteristic of what is expressed, 3) the characteristic of the connection between names and meanings, 4) the characteristic of attachment, and 5) the characteristic of non-attachment.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c05_2']	又說三相，謂分別相、依他相、真實相。	又說三相，謂分別相、依他相、真實相。	They also speak of three characteristics: the characteristic of discrimination, the characteristic of other-dependence, and the characteristic of reality.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c05_10']	此二處相攝云何？	此二處相攝云何？	How are these two sets of characteristics mutually inclusive?
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c05_20']	為五攝三、為三攝五？	為五攝三、為三攝五？	Are the five included in the three, or are the three included in the five?
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c06_2']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c06_11']	今約三相分別五相。	今約三相分別五相。	Now, the five characteristics are distinguished according to the three characteristics.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c08_18']	應知五相中前二相通為三相所攝，第三相偏為分別相攝，第四相但為依他相攝，第五相唯為真實相攝。	應知五相中前二相通為三相所攝，第三相偏為分別相攝，第四相但為依他相攝，第五相唯為真實相攝。	It should be known that the first two characteristics among the five characteristics are generally included in the three characteristics. The third characteristic is specifically included in the characteristic of discrimination. The fourth characteristic is only included in the characteristic of other-dependence. The fifth characteristic is only included in the characteristic of reality.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c09_2']	釋曰：	釋曰：	Explanation:
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c10_16']	初二相所以通為三相所攝者，初名言相即是諸法名字及說此名言是識所作。	初二相所以通為三相所攝者，初名言相即是諸法名字及說此名言是識所作。	The first two characteristics are generally included in the three characteristics because the first, the characteristic of names and expressions, is the names and expressions of all dharmas and the speaking of these names and expressions is the function of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c13_17']	識似名言相起即是分別性，能分別識即依他性，所分別名言既無所有、能分別識亦無所有，即是真實性，是故初相即三性攝。	識似名言相起即是分別性，能分別識即依他性，所分別名言既無所有、能分別識亦無所有，即是真實性，是故初相即三性攝。	Consciousness arising as similar to the characteristic of names and expressions is the nature of discrimination, the consciousness that discriminates is the nature of dependence on others, and since the named and expressed that are discriminated do not exist, the consciousness that discriminates also does not exist, which is the nature of reality. Therefore, the first characteristic is included in the three natures.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c17_8']	第二相亦三性攝者，所言相即是名言所目義，謂一切諸物亦是識所作，但識有似物相起即是分別性，能分別識即是依他性，亦二俱無所有，即是真實性。	第二相亦三性攝者，所言相即是名言所目義，謂一切諸物亦是識所作，但識有似物相起即是分別性，能分別識即是依他性，亦二俱無所有，即是真實性。	The second characteristic is also included in the three natures because the so-called characteristic is the meaning aimed at by names and expressions, referring to all things, which are also the function of consciousness. But consciousness arising as similar to the appearance of things is the nature of discrimination, the consciousness that discriminates is the nature of dependence on others, and both are non-existent, which is the nature of reality.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c19_5']	第三相但為分別性所攝者，此名義相應相，謂為物立名令與物相應，因名得顯物。	第三相但為分別性所攝者，此名義相應相，謂為物立名令與物相應，因名得顯物。	The third characteristic is only included in the nature of discrimination because this is the characteristic of the correspondence between names and meanings, which means establishing names for things in order to make them correspond with things, and by means of names one can manifest things.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c20_4']	此名義實無所有，無相義故但是分別性。	此名義實無所有，無相義故但是分別性。	These names and meanings are actually non-existent, because they are devoid of characteristics, they are only the nature of discrimination.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c22_5']	第四相但為依他性攝者，此執著名義二相辨其能執故但是依他性，不明所執故非分別。	第四相但為依他性攝者，此執著名義二相辨其能執故但是依他性，不明所執故非分別。	The fourth characteristic is only included in the nature of dependent arising. This attachment to the two characteristics of names and meanings distinguishes the grasper, so it is only the nature of dependent arising. Because it does not clarify the grasped, it is not discrimination.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c23_3']	前但出所分別不出能分別，故非依他。	前但出所分別不出能分別，故非依他。	The previous [characteristic] only brings out the discriminated, but does not bring out the discriminator, so it is not dependent arising.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c24_17']	第五相唯為真性所攝者，此不執著名義二相，即是境智無差別阿摩羅識故。	第五相唯為真性所攝者，此不執著名義二相，即是境智無差別阿摩羅識故。	The fifth characteristic is only included in the nature of true reality. This non-attachment to the two characteristics of names and meanings is precisely the consciousness of non-defilement and purity without distinction between object and cognition.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c26_3']	第四第三亦不離真實性，但其所立正為偏顯一義耳。	第四第三亦不離真實性，但其所立正為偏顯一義耳。	The fourth and third are also not apart from the nature of true reality, but their establishment is precisely to clearly manifest one meaning in a biased way.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c27_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c27_11']	分別各有五種事用。	分別各有五種事用。	Discrimination has five kinds of affairs and functions each.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c28_12']	復次此三性，應知一一性中皆有五事分別性具。	復次此三性，應知一一性中皆有五事分別性具。	Furthermore, it should be known that each of these three natures is fully endowed with the five affairs of the nature of discrimination.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0873c28_17']	五事用者：	五事用者：	The five affairs and functions are:
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a02_7']	一能生依他性、二於依他性中能立名言、三能起人法兩執、四能成立二執麁重、五能作入真實性依止事。	一能生依他性、二於依他性中能立名言、三能起人法兩執、四能成立二執麁重、五能作入真實性依止事。	The first is the basis for the arising of the dependent nature, the second is the establishment of names and expressions within the dependent nature, the third is the ability to give rise to the two attachments to persons and dharmas, the fourth is the ability to establish the coarseness and heaviness of the two attachments, and the fifth is the ability to act as the basis for entering into the true nature.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a02_10']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a04_14']	初即能生義體，次能生義上名言，第三即能生起人法二相，第四即能生煩惱，第五即能解脫。	初即能生義體，次能生義上名言，第三即能生起人法二相，第四即能生煩惱，第五即能解脫。	The first is the essence that is able to give rise, the next is able to give rise to names and expressions above the meaning, the third is able to give rise to the two appearances of persons and dharmas, the fourth is able to give rise to afflictions, and the fifth is able to bring about liberation.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a06_1']	前三明能作起惑、得解方便，第四正明起惑，第五明得解。	前三明能作起惑、得解方便，第四正明起惑，第五明得解。	The first three clarify the means of giving rise to delusions and attaining liberation, the fourth directly clarifies the giving rise to delusions, and the fifth clarifies the attainment of liberation.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a06_15']	有此次第者必有體，故立名言。	有此次第者必有體，故立名言。	There must be an essence for there to be this sequence, therefore names and expressions are established.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a07_9']	由有名言故，所以起人法兩執。	由有名言故，所以起人法兩執。	Because there are names and expressions, therefore the two attachments to persons and dharmas arise.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a08_3']	由人法兩執故，增長起諸煩惱。	由人法兩執故，增長起諸煩惱。	Because of the two attachments to persons and dharmas, the various afflictions increase and arise.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a08_16']	前唯起人法兩執，此則輕微；	前唯起人法兩執，此則輕微；	The previous [stage] only gives rise to the two attachments to persons and dharmas, this is slight;
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a09_17']	由此後起無量惑，由此以後久久輪轉方能依止。	由此後起無量惑，由此以後久久輪轉方能依止。	Because of this, immeasurable afflictions arise afterwards, and because of this, one is able to rely on them for a long time afterwards.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a10_16']	此分別、依他得入真實性，故得解脫也。	此分別、依他得入真實性，故得解脫也。	By this discrimination and dependence on the other, one enters the nature of reality and thus attains liberation.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a11_16']	依他性五事者，一生成煩惱體；	依他性五事者，一生成煩惱體；	The five things of the dependent nature are: first, the basis for the arising of afflictions;
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a12_9']	二能為分別、真實兩性依止；	二能為分別、真實兩性依止；	second, able to be the basis for both the discriminating and true natures;
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a13_2']	三能起人法兩執名言依止；	三能起人法兩執名言依止；	third, able to be the basis for the arising of the verbal expressions of grasping at persons and dharmas;
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a13_14']	四能為人法兩執麁重依止；	四能為人法兩執麁重依止；	fourth, able to be the basis for the coarseness and heaviness of grasping at persons and dharmas;

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a14_8']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a16_1']	一生成煩惱體者，謂依他性有體，異於分別性無體，故能為煩惱體也。	一生成煩惱體者，謂依他性有體，異於分別性無體，故能為煩惱體也。	First, the basis for the arising of afflictions means that the dependent nature has a substance that is different from the discriminating nature that lacks a substance, and therefore it is able to be the substance of afflictions.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0874a17_16']	二能為分別、真實二性依止者，謂依他性執為人法我者，即為分別性作依止。	二能為分別、真實二性依止者，謂依他性執為人法我者，即為分別性作依止。	Second, able to be the basis for both the discriminating and true natures means that if the dependent nature is grasped as the self of persons and dharmas, it becomes the basis for the discriminating nature.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0878a20_12']	攝惑者，為異二乘，若無惑人一向涅槃，則不能成熟佛法、教化眾生，是故菩薩勤攝留惑。	攝惑者，為異二乘，若無惑人一向涅槃，則不能成熟佛法、教化眾生，是故菩薩勤攝留惑。	As for subsuming afflictions, it is different from the two vehicles. If one without afflictions completely enters nirvana, then one will not be able to mature the Buddha Dharma and transform sentient beings. Therefore, bodhisattvas diligently subsume and retain afflictions.

If one cultivates biased wisdom, then one abandons birth and death and cannot benefit oneself or others, therefore one arouses right effort to subdue the wisdom of the two vehicles.

These two are both based on the ability of the object to give rise to wisdom, taking the object that gives rise to it as the essence of skillful means.
['ZH_T31_1617_002:0878b09_5']	第三方便正行為體，第四方便共利為體，第五方便依止為體。	第三方便正行為體，第四方便共利為體，第五方便依止為體。	The third skillful means takes right practice as its essence, the fourth skillful means takes common benefit as its essence, and the fifth skillful means takes reliance as its essence.

The first two are expedient conditions, the next one is the correct expedient, the fourth is the fruit of the expedient, because by this expedient one attains benefit for oneself and others.

['ZH_T31_1617_002:0878b15_18']	如小乘說佛入無心定還更起心也。	如小乘說佛入無心定還更起心也。	It is like the Hinayana teaching that the Buddha enters the mindless concentration and then arises again.

It is because it has the ability to benefit oneself and others, and to liberate and not enter nirvāṇa.
