['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251a26_1']	於欲界中不善業果非必應為善業果雜。	於欲界中不善業果非必應為善業果雜。	016	In the desire realm, the fruits of unwholesome karma are not necessarily mixed with the fruits of wholesome karma.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251a27_2']	如斷善人造諸惡業及地獄中受黑異熟果。	如斷善人造諸惡業及地獄中受黑異熟果。	016	For example, when a person who has severed wholesome roots creates various evil karmas and receives black karmic fruits in hell.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251a27_16']	欲界善業果必定應為惡業果雜。	欲界善業果必定應為惡業果雜。	016	The fruits of wholesome karma in the desire realm must be mixed with the fruits of unwholesome karma.

Those who have already become free from desire and create wholesome karma in the desire realm are definitely not mixed with evil, and should be called purely white.🔽Why are all the wholesome karmas in the desire realm called mixed karmas?
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b02_18']	據未斷說。	據未斷說。	016	The explanation is: The wholesome karmas in the desire realm that are called mixed refer to those that have not yet been severed.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b03_4']	若細分別。	若細分別。	016	If one makes a fine distinction,
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b03_17']	已離欲者作欲善業非惡業雜。	已離欲者作欲善業非惡業雜。	016	those who have already become free from desire and create wholesome karma in the desire realm are not mixed with evil karma.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b04_8']	雖為因時非惡業雜。	雖為因時非惡業雜。	016	Although at the time of being the cause they are not mixed with evil karma,
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b04_17']	受果之時必惡果雜。	受果之時必惡果雜。	016	When receiving the fruit, it must be mixed with evil fruit.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b06_1']	以因從果總名為雜　或相雜類故名為相雜。	以因從果總名為雜　或相雜類故名為相雜。	016	Following the fruit, it is generally called mixed. Or it is called mixed because it is of a mixed type.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b06_10']	以欲界中惡勝善故。	以欲界中惡勝善故。	016	Because in the desire realm, evil is superior to good.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b07_1']	惡名黑黑不名白黑。	惡名黑黑不名白黑。	016	Evil is called black and black, not white and black.

['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b08_19']	一切不善業皆名黑黑異熟業。	一切不善業皆名黑黑異熟業。	016	All unwholesome karma is called karma with black and black retribution.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b09_16']	由欲界中不善強盛不為善法之所陵雜。	由欲界中不善強盛不為善法之所陵雜。	016	Because in the desire realm, unwholesomeness is strong and is not mixed with wholesome dharmas.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b10_10']	以不善法能斷自地善故。	以不善法能斷自地善故。	016	Because unwholesome dharmas can cut off the wholesome dharmas of their own stage.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b11_6']	善業羸劣而為不善之所陵雜。	善業羸劣而為不善之所陵雜。	016	Wholesome karma is weak and is mixed with unwholesomeness.
['ZH_T41_1821_016:0251b12_1']	以欲界善不能斷不善故。	以欲界善不能斷不善故。	016	Because the wholesome dharmas of the desire realm cannot cut off unwholesomeness.

If it is said that those that arise from receiving must all have both, why does the previous text say that the prātimokṣa precepts are not necessarily generated based on manifest karma? The explanation is: since it is said that they arise from receiving, it is clear that they are not natural.
