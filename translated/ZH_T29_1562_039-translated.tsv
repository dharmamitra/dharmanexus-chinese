['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c09_0']	從一切二現，　　得欲界律儀，	從一切二現，　　得欲界律儀，	039	In the desire realm, the discipline is obtained from all two present states,
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c10_13']	從根本恒時，　　得靜慮無漏。	從根本恒時，　　得靜慮無漏。	039	In the meditative absorptions and the undefiled, it is obtained from the fundamental and always.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c11_2']	論曰：	論曰：	039	Discussion:
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c12_10']	欲界律儀謂別解脫，此從一切根本業道，及從前後近分而得。	欲界律儀謂別解脫，此從一切根本業道，及從前後近分而得。	039	The discipline of the desire realm refers to the prātimokṣa. It is obtained from all fundamental karmic paths and from the proximate preliminaries before and after.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c13_11']	從二得者，謂從二類，即情非情、性罪遮罪。	從二得者，謂從二類，即情非情、性罪遮罪。	039	From two means it is obtained from two types: sentient beings and non-sentient beings, natural offenses and prohibited offenses.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c15_7']	於情性罪謂殺等業，遮謂女人同室宿等，非情性罪謂盜外財，遮謂掘地斷生草等。	於情性罪謂殺等業，遮謂女人同室宿等，非情性罪謂盜外財，遮謂掘地斷生草等。	039	As for natural offenses against sentient beings, it refers to actions such as killing. Prohibited offenses refer to things like sleeping in the same room as a woman. As for natural offenses against non-sentient beings, it refers to stealing external property. Prohibited offenses refer to things like digging the ground and cutting living grass.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c17_5']	從現得者，謂從現世蘊處界得，非從去來，由此律儀有情處轉，去來非是有情處故。	從現得者，謂從現世蘊處界得，非從去來，由此律儀有情處轉，去來非是有情處故。	039	That obtained from the present is that obtained from the aggregates, sense bases, and realms of the present, not from the past or future, because this discipline exists in the realm of sentient beings, and the past and future are not the realm of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c18_4']	有情處者，謂諸有情及諸有情所依止處。	有情處者，謂諸有情及諸有情所依止處。	039	The realm of sentient beings refers to all sentient beings and the place where sentient beings depend.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c19_12']	現蘊處界，內者即是有情所依，外者名為有情所止，非過未故。	現蘊處界，內者即是有情所依，外者名為有情所止，非過未故。	039	The present aggregates, sense bases, and realms are the basis of sentient beings, while the external is called the place where sentient beings abide, because it is not past or future.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c21_3']	若得靜慮無漏律儀，應知但從根本業道，以定中唯有根本業道故。	若得靜慮無漏律儀，應知但從根本業道，以定中唯有根本業道故。	039	If one obtains the discipline of dhyāna and the undefiled, one should know that it is only obtained from the fundamental karmic paths, because in concentration there are only fundamental karmic paths.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c22_13']	非從前後近分而得，以在定位唯有根本，在不定位中無此律儀故。	非從前後近分而得，以在定位唯有根本，在不定位中無此律儀故。	039	It is not obtained from the proximate parts before and after, because in the state of concentration there are only fundamental [karmic paths], and in the state of non-concentration this discipline does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c24_2']	從有情數所發遮罪，尚不得此二種律儀，況從非情所發遮罪。	從有情數所發遮罪，尚不得此二種律儀，況從非情所發遮罪。	039	One does not obtain these two kinds of discipline even from the prohibited offenses committed by sentient beings, let alone from the prohibited offenses committed by non-sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c25_1']	從恒時者，謂從過去現在未來蘊處界得。	從恒時者，謂從過去現在未來蘊處界得。	039	That obtained from the eternal refers to that obtained from the aggregates, sense bases, and realms of the past, present, and future.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c26_16']	如與此戒為俱有心，由此不同應作四句，有蘊處界從彼唯得別解律儀非餘二等。	如與此戒為俱有心，由此不同應作四句，有蘊處界從彼唯得別解律儀非餘二等。	039	The mind that accompanies this precept is not the same as the mind that accompanies the other two. Therefore, four sentences are to be formulated. There are aggregates, sense bases, and elements from which one obtains only the prātimokṣa restraint and not the other two, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c27_16']	第一句者，謂從現世前後近分及諸遮罪。	第一句者，謂從現世前後近分及諸遮罪。	039	The first sentence refers to the present, the proximate access concentrations before and after, and the sins of prohibition.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c28_11']	第二句者，謂從去來根本業道。	第二句者，謂從去來根本業道。	039	The second sentence refers to the past and future fundamental karmic paths.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c29_5']	第三句者，謂從現世根本業道。	第三句者，謂從現世根本業道。	039	The third sentence refers to the present fundamental karmic paths.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0561c29_19']	第四句者，謂從去來前後近分。	第四句者，謂從去來前後近分。	039	The fourth sentence refers to the past and future access concentrations before and after.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a02_7']	有言非得善律儀時，可有現世惡業道等，故應別立此四句文。	有言非得善律儀時，可有現世惡業道等，故應別立此四句文。	039	Some say that when one obtains the non-acquisition of good restraint, one may have present evil karmic paths, etc. Therefore, these four sentences should be established separately.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a03_15']	謂應說言有一類法，於彼唯得別解律儀非二律儀，乃至廣說。	謂應說言有一類法，於彼唯得別解律儀非二律儀，乃至廣說。	039	That is to say, it should be said that there are some dharmas from which one obtains only the prātimokṣa restraint and not the other two restraints, and so on.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a04_16']	第一句者，謂於現在得前後近分及遮罪遠離；	第一句者，謂於現在得前後近分及遮罪遠離；	039	The first sentence refers to the present, the proximate access concentrations before and after, and the avoidance of prohibited sins;
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a05_6']	餘隨所應皆如是說。	餘隨所應皆如是說。	039	the rest should be explained as appropriate.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a06_7']	於業道等處，置業道等聲，故前四句義亦無失。	於業道等處，置業道等聲，故前四句義亦無失。	039	In the context of karmic paths and so on, the terms karmic paths and so on are used, so the meaning of the previous four statements is also not lost.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a08_1']	由如是理亦通防護，過現業道等，非唯防未來，以業道等聲說彼依處故。	由如是理亦通防護，過現業道等，非唯防未來，以業道等聲說彼依處故。	039	By this principle, one also protects past and present karmic paths and so on, not just the future, because the terms karmic paths and so on refer to their bases.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a10_7']	若異此者，則應但說防護未來，律儀但能防未來罪令不起故，非防過現已滅已生，律儀於彼無防用故。	若異此者，則應但說防護未來，律儀但能防未來罪令不起故，非防過現已滅已生，律儀於彼無防用故。	039	If it were otherwise, then one would only speak of protecting the future, because the precepts can only prevent future offenses from arising, not prevent past and present offenses that have already ceased or already arisen, because the precepts have no preventive function with regard to them.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a11_8']	諸有獲得律不律儀，從一切有情支因皆等不？	諸有獲得律不律儀，從一切有情支因皆等不？	039	Do all those who obtain precepts and non-precepts do so equally in terms of all sentient beings and factors?
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a11_13']	非一切等。	非一切等。	039	Not all are equal.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a11_18']	其相云何？	其相云何？	039	What are their characteristics?
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a12_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	039	The verse states:
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a13_13']	律從諸有情，　　支因說不定；	律從諸有情，　　支因說不定；	039	Precepts are said to be indefinite in terms of all sentient beings and factors.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a14_13']	不律從一切，　　有情支非因。	不律從一切，　　有情支非因。	039	Non-precepts come from all sentient beings and factors, but not from causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a15_2']	論曰：	論曰：	039	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a16_10']	律儀定由調善意樂，普緣一切有情方得，非少分緣惡心隨故。	律儀定由調善意樂，普緣一切有情方得，非少分緣惡心隨故。	039	Precepts are definitely obtained through a well-disciplined attitude and universally considering all sentient beings, not through considering a small portion and following an evil mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a16_20']	支因不定，支謂業道。	支因不定，支謂業道。	039	The conditions for the various factors are not fixed. The factors refer to the karmic paths.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a17_19']	且於別解諸律儀中，有從一切支，謂苾芻戒。	且於別解諸律儀中，有從一切支，謂苾芻戒。	039	Moreover, among the various precepts of restraint, there are those obtained from all factors, namely the precepts of a bhikṣu.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a18_10']	有從四支得，謂餘律儀。	有從四支得，謂餘律儀。	039	There are those obtained from four factors, namely the other forms of discipline.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a18_20']	許因不同，略有二種：	許因不同，略有二種：	039	It is allowed that the causes are not the same. In brief, there are two kinds:
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a19_16']	一無貪等三種善根、二下中上等起心。	一無貪等三種善根、二下中上等起心。	039	First, the three wholesome roots such as non-greed, and second, the mind that arises from the lower, middle, and upper levels.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a19_18']	別。	別。	039	Different.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a20_16']	就初因說一切律儀，由一切因一心有故。	就初因說一切律儀，由一切因一心有故。	039	Based on the first cause, it is said that all forms of discipline are due to all causes, because the mind exists in one thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a22_6']	就後因說一切律儀，各由一因，以下品等不俱時起，如先說故。	就後因說一切律儀，各由一因，以下品等不俱時起，如先說故。	039	Based on the latter cause, it is said that all forms of discipline are each due to one cause, because the lower, middle, and upper levels do not arise simultaneously, as previously explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a22_15']	此中且就後三因說。	此中且就後三因說。	039	Here, it is based on the latter three causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a24_18']	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，非一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受近事勤策戒。	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，非一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受近事勤策戒。	039	There may be one type of person who abides in discipline and obtains discipline towards all sentient beings, but not all factors and not all causes, namely those who receive the precepts of the lay devotee and the novice monk with a lower, middle, or upper mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a27_1']	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受苾芻戒。	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受苾芻戒。	039	There is one kind of person who abides in the precepts and obtains the precepts with regard to all sentient beings, but by all the branches and not by all causes, namely, one who receives the precepts of a bhikṣu with a lesser, middling, or superior mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a29_3']	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支及一切因，謂以三心受近事、勤策、苾芻戒。	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支及一切因，謂以三心受近事、勤策、苾芻戒。	039	There is one kind of person who abides in the precepts and obtains the precepts with regard to all sentient beings, by all the branches and by all the causes, namely, one who receives the precepts of the upāsaka, śrāmaṇera, and bhikṣu with the three kinds of minds.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562a29_12']	或有一類住律儀者。	或有一類住律儀者。	039	There is one kind of person who abides in the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b01_2']	於一切有情得律儀。	於一切有情得律儀。	039	With regard to all sentient beings, he obtains the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b02_6']	由一切因非一切支，謂以三心受近事、近住、勤策戒。	由一切因非一切支，謂以三心受近事、近住、勤策戒。	039	By all the causes but not by all the branches, namely, one who receives the precepts of the upāsaka, upavāsastha, and śrāmaṇera with the three kinds of minds.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b03_4']	無有不遍於諸有情得律儀者，已說因故。	無有不遍於諸有情得律儀者，已說因故。	039	There is no one who does not obtain the precepts with regard to all sentient beings, because the causes have already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b04_3']	非於一分諸有情所，誓受律儀惡心全息。	非於一分諸有情所，誓受律儀惡心全息。	039	It is not the case that with regard to a part of sentient beings one vows to abide in the precepts and completely stops evil thoughts.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b04_8']	今應思擇：	今應思擇：	039	Now we should consider:
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b05_6']	於佛乃至蟻子身上，所得律儀為有別不？	於佛乃至蟻子身上，所得律儀為有別不？	039	Is there a difference in the precepts obtained with regard to the body of a buddha up to an ant?
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b06_9']	若有別者，趣不定故，於諸有情所得律儀應有增減。	若有別者，趣不定故，於諸有情所得律儀應有增減。	039	If there is a difference, then the destinies would not be fixed, and the precepts received by sentient beings would increase and decrease.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b08_3']	若無別者，何緣殺人犯他勝罪，殺非人者唯犯麁惡，若殺傍生犯墮落罪？	若無別者，何緣殺人犯他勝罪，殺非人者唯犯麁惡，若殺傍生犯墮落罪？	039	If there is no difference, then why is killing a human a pārājika offense, while killing a non-human is only a sthūlātyaya offense, and killing an animal is a pāyantika offense?
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b09_2']	非有情境身差別故，令所受戒亦有差別。	非有情境身差別故，令所受戒亦有差別。	039	It is because of the difference in the non-sentient objects and the body. It causes the precepts received to also have differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b10_1']	然罰罪業有差別者，應知但由別加行故。	然罰罪業有差別者，應知但由別加行故。	039	However, the difference in the punishment and sin should be known to be only due to the difference in the preparatory action.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b10_21']	殺人加行，與殺非人，乃至殺蟻，皆有差別。	殺人加行，與殺非人，乃至殺蟻，皆有差別。	039	The preparatory action for killing a human is different from the preparatory action for killing a non-human, up to killing an ant. All have differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b11_18']	且殺同趣同部罪中，由加行殊，業尚有異。	且殺同趣同部罪中，由加行殊，業尚有異。	039	Moreover, in the sin of killing those of the same destiny and the same category, due to the difference in the preparatory action, the karma still has differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b13_15']	如殺香象所獲罪多，若殺蚊虻所獲罪少，何況異趣加行有別，異部罪中而無輕重？	如殺香象所獲罪多，若殺蚊虻所獲罪少，何況異趣加行有別，異部罪中而無輕重？	039	For example, the sin obtained from killing an fragrant elephant is much greater, while the sin obtained from killing a mosquito or a gnat is much less. How much more so for those of different destinies, where the preparatory actions are different, and there is no lightness or heaviness in the sin of a different category?
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b17_16']	由總意樂建立律儀，謂普於有情無有差別起調善意樂求得律儀，非於一有情不捨惡意樂而可求得別解律儀，故得律儀無有差別，以得律儀者必不別觀補特伽羅支處時緣故。	由總意樂建立律儀，謂普於有情無有差別起調善意樂求得律儀，非於一有情不捨惡意樂而可求得別解律儀，故得律儀無有差別，以得律儀者必不別觀補特伽羅支處時緣故。	039	Vows are established by a general attitude, that is, by seeking to obtain vows with a well-regulated attitude that makes no distinction among sentient beings. One cannot obtain prātimokṣa vows by seeking them with an attitude that does not abandon evil with regard to a single sentient being. Therefore, there is no distinction in the obtaining of vows, because one who obtains vows certainly does not consider the individual, the factors, the place, the time, or the occasion.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b21_12']	謂定不作如是別觀，於某有情我離殺等、於某支戒我定能持、於某方域我離殺等、我唯於彼一月等時除戰等緣能離殺等，如是受者不得律儀，但得律儀相似妙行。	謂定不作如是別觀，於某有情我離殺等、於某支戒我定能持、於某方域我離殺等、我唯於彼一月等時除戰等緣能離殺等，如是受者不得律儀，但得律儀相似妙行。	039	That is to say, one certainly does not consider in this way: “I abstain from killing, etc., with regard to a certain sentient being. I am able to observe this factor of the precepts. I abstain from killing, etc., in a certain region. I am able to abstain from killing, etc., for only one month, etc., except in the case of war, etc.” One who undertakes in this way does not obtain the precepts, but only precepts that resemble the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b22_10']	是故無有由諸有情身差別故戒有差別。	是故無有由諸有情身差別故戒有差別。	039	Therefore, there is no distinction in the precepts due to the difference in the bodies of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b25_7']	又於自身不得根本業道所攝別解律儀，勿思法等由自殺害成無間等所攝罪業，得眷屬攝於理無遮，謂離最初眾餘罪等。	又於自身不得根本業道所攝別解律儀，勿思法等由自殺害成無間等所攝罪業，得眷屬攝於理無遮，謂離最初眾餘罪等。	039	Also, one does not obtain the prātimokṣa restraint that is included in the fundamental karmic paths in one’s own body, lest one commit the sin of killing oneself and thereby commit the sin of immediate retribution, etc. It is reasonable that one obtains the restraint that is included in the subsidiary karmic paths, that is, one excludes the first of the remaining sins, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b27_17']	又此所受別解脫律儀，通於一切能不能境得，非唯於能境得此律儀，要普於有情起無損惱意樂無別方可得故。	又此所受別解脫律儀，通於一切能不能境得，非唯於能境得此律儀，要普於有情起無損惱意樂無別方可得故。	039	Also, this prātimokṣa restraint that one receives is obtained in relation to all objects, whether able or unable to understand. One does not obtain this restraint only in relation to able objects, because one must universally generate the intention not to harm sentient beings without distinction in order to obtain it.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562b29_1']	若謂不然，於睡悶等皆不可殺，故應不得律儀。	若謂不然，於睡悶等皆不可殺，故應不得律儀。	039	If one does not agree with this, then one cannot kill those who are asleep or in a faint, etc., and therefore one should not obtain the restraint.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562c01_16']	若謂彼覺得本心已還可殺者，此亦應然，以非所能有可改易為能境已還可殺故。	若謂彼覺得本心已還可殺者，此亦應然，以非所能有可改易為能境已還可殺故。	039	If one says that one can kill them again after they have regained their original mind, then this should also be so, because those who are unable can become able objects and then can be killed again.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562c02_3']	有作是說：	有作是說：	039	There is an opinion that
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0562c03_14']	若唯於能，則此律儀應有增減，以所能境與非所能二類有情有轉易故。	若唯於能，則此律儀應有增減，以所能境與非所能二類有情有轉易故。	039	if one only obtains the restraint in relation to able objects, then this restraint should increase and decrease, because the two categories of sentient beings, able and unable, can change.

['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567b25_4']	謂扇搋等婬愛多行，無暫伏除對治道故。	謂扇搋等婬愛多行，無暫伏除對治道故。	039	This refers to eunuchs, etc., whose sexual desires are often in action and who never subdue them by means of the antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567b28_1']	非諸數起猛利愛人，能於有情起極猛利勃惡意樂令現在前，設暫能生亦不堅住，身無能故心亦無能，故彼類身亦無惡戒。	非諸數起猛利愛人，能於有情起極猛利勃惡意樂令現在前，設暫能生亦不堅住，身無能故心亦無能，故彼類身亦無惡戒。	039	Those whose desires are often in action and are intense are unable to generate a most intense and evil volition toward sentient beings and make it present. Even if they could generate it for a while, it would not endure, because their bodies and minds are incapable of it. Therefore, their bodies are also devoid of evil moral natures.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c01_17']	即由此理，善阿世耶於彼身中劣不堅住，要有強盛堅住惡心方有惡戒，及有強盛堅住善心方有善戒，彼俱闕故，二戒俱無。	即由此理，善阿世耶於彼身中劣不堅住，要有強盛堅住惡心方有惡戒，及有強盛堅住善心方有善戒，彼俱闕故，二戒俱無。	039	For this reason, the good mind is weak and unstable in their bodies. Only when there is a strong and stable evil mind can there be evil morality, and only when there is a strong and stable good mind can there be good morality. Since both are lacking in them, they have neither kind of morality.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c02_15']	然二形生捨善惡戒，二依貪欲極增上故。	然二形生捨善惡戒，二依貪欲極增上故。	039	However, when the two organs appear, one loses both good and evil morality, because the two organs are extremely strong and excessive.

['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c05_14']	由如是理已釋北洲，二阿世耶非猛利故，又不順起三摩地故，彼身無有善惡律儀。	由如是理已釋北洲，二阿世耶非猛利故，又不順起三摩地故，彼身無有善惡律儀。	039	The same principle explains that there is no good or evil morality in Uttarakuru, because the two minds are not strong and sharp there, and because they do not conform to samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c08_3']	惡趣無能覺耶正理，又非猛利慚愧所依，要此相應及損壞者，方可得有善惡律儀，故惡趣中無善惡戒。	惡趣無能覺耶正理，又非猛利慚愧所依，要此相應及損壞者，方可得有善惡律儀，故惡趣中無善惡戒。	039	Evil destinies are not capable of understanding correct principles, and they are not the support of sharp conscience and shame. Only when these are associated with and destroy can there be good or evil morality, and therefore there is no good or evil morality in evil destinies.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c09_2']	又扇搋等如醎鹵田，故不能生善戒惡戒。	又扇搋等如醎鹵田，故不能生善戒惡戒。	039	Also, eunuchs, etc., are like salty fields and therefore cannot produce good or evil morality.

['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c12_16']	此得妙行非得律儀，是故律儀唯人天有。	此得妙行非得律儀，是故律儀唯人天有。	039	They obtain the precepts of good conduct but do not obtain the precepts of restraint. Therefore the precepts of restraint exist only among humans and gods.

['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c15_5']	若生欲天及生色界，皆容得有靜慮律儀，然無想天但容成就。	若生欲天及生色界，皆容得有靜慮律儀，然無想天但容成就。	039	If one is born among the desire gods or born in the form realm, one may obtain the dhyāna precepts. However, the asaiksa gods only possess them.
['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c16_4']	生無色界，彼俱非有無漏律儀，亦在無色。	生無色界，彼俱非有無漏律儀，亦在無色。	039	In the formless realm, neither of them exist. The pure precepts also exist in the formless realm.

['ZH_T29_1562_039:0567c19_3']	生無色中唯得成就，以無色故必不現起，無漏上生得成下故。	生無色中唯得成就，以無色故必不現起，無漏上生得成下故。	039	When born in the formless realm, one only attains and accomplishes [the formless concentrations], because being formless, they do not necessarily manifest. When one is born in a higher realm without outflows, one attains those of a lower realm.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
