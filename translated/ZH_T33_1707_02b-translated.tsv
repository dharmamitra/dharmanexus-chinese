['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336a27_19']	初約出用者，諸法本自不生、今亦不滅，以因緣故，於無分別中為眾生說有生滅。	初約出用者，諸法本自不生、今亦不滅，以因緣故，於無分別中為眾生說有生滅。	As for the first, about manifesting function, all dharmas are originally unborn and now also unceasing, because of causes and conditions, in the absence of discrimination, for sentient beings it is said there is birth and cessation.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336a28_19']	文云一切諸佛是中生者，依忍化現成佛名生。	文云一切諸佛是中生者，依忍化現成佛名生。	The text says, All buddhas are born from within this, relying on forbearance to manifest the attainment of buddhahood is called birth.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336a29_11']	是中滅者，滅惑化隱名滅。	是中滅者，滅惑化隱名滅。	Extinction within this means the extinction of afflictions and the concealment of transformation is called extinction.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b01_3']	是中化者，依忍化眾生也。	是中化者，依忍化眾生也。	Transformation within this means relying on forbearance to transform sentient beings.

Up to this point, for the sake of conditions, the arising, ceasing, transforming, etc., of the functioning of the mind are explained. If one knows that arising, etc. are originally non-arising and non-ceasing, then there is no need to speak of them. Fearing that sentient beings will cling to characteristics based on names, it is pointed out that what was previously said to arise is called non-arising, non-ceasing, and so forth.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b06_7']	亦得用無生破前生，無滅故破前滅，無化破前化生也。	亦得用無生破前生，無滅故破前滅，無化破前化生也。	It can also be said that non-arising refutes previous arising, non-ceasing refutes previous ceasing, and no transformation refutes previous transformation.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b07_11']	無自無他者，自心不生名不自，不見前境故云無他。	無自無他者，自心不生名不自，不見前境故云無他。	No self, no other means that the mind does not arise by itself, so it is called no self. Since it does not perceive external objects, it is said to be no other.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b08_9']	亦云不見自名滅我，不見他名滅我所。	亦云不見自名滅我，不見他名滅我所。	It can also be said that not perceiving the self is called the cessation of the self, and not perceiving others is called the cessation of what belongs to the self.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b09_6']	第一無二者，境智俱寂故云第一無二也。	第一無二者，境智俱寂故云第一無二也。	The foremost non-duality means that both the object and cognition are tranquil, so it is called the foremost non-duality.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b11_16']	非化非不化者，無得正觀居心，有時說化為不化，有時說不化為化，故云非化非不化，豈得以常人定執消文也。	非化非不化者，無得正觀居心，有時說化為不化，有時說不化為化，故云非化非不化，豈得以常人定執消文也。	As for neither transformation nor non-transformation, without attaining the correct contemplation residing in the mind, sometimes transformation is spoken of as non-transformation, and sometimes non-transformation is spoken of as transformation. Therefore it says neither transformation nor non-transformation. How can one interpret the text with the fixed attachments of ordinary people?
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b13_2']	非無相者，恐眾生聞悟入之言，謂皆無所有，故云非無相。	非無相者，恐眾生聞悟入之言，謂皆無所有，故云非無相。	As for not being signless, fearing that sentient beings hearing the words realization and entry would think they are all nonexistent, it therefore says not being signless.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b14_1']	如《大品》云「無所得得」，如是得無所得義耳。	如《大品》云「無所得得」，如是得無所得義耳。	As the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, attaining the unattainable, it is like this, attaining the meaning of the unattainable.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b15_8']	無來無去者，來無所從、去無所至乃至無依無得，故云如虛空。	無來無去者，來無所從、去無所至乃至無依無得，故云如虛空。	As for neither coming nor going, coming from nowhere and going nowhere, up to being without support and without attainment, it is therefore said to be like space.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b19_21']	「一切眾生無生滅、無縛解、非因非果非不因果，煩惱我人知見、受者我所者、一切苦受行空故，一切法集幻化五陰，無含無散，法同法性寂然空故，法境界空，空無相不轉不顛倒，不順幻化。	「一切眾生無生滅、無縛解、非因非果非不因果，煩惱我人知見、受者我所者、一切苦受行空故，一切法集幻化五陰，無含無散，法同法性寂然空故，法境界空，空無相不轉不顛倒，不順幻化。	All sentient beings are without birth and death, without bondage and liberation, neither causes nor effects, not non-causes and non-effects. Afflictions, self, person, cognition, and views, the receiver, the possessor of self, all painful experiences and practices are empty. All dharmas are gathered like illusions and transformations, the five aggregates, without inclusion or dispersion, because the Dharma is the same as the nature of dharmas, tranquil and empty. The realm of the Dharma is empty, emptiness is signless, non-turning, non-inverted, not in accord with illusory transformations.

Sentient beings are originally unattainable and free from suffering, so it says without birth and without death.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b25_19']	離集故無縛無解，無集故非因，無苦故非果。	離集故無縛無解，無集故非因，無苦故非果。	Because of the absence of accumulation, there is no bondage and no liberation. Because of the absence of accumulation, there is no cause. Because of the absence of suffering, there is no effect.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b26_10']	以因緣隨俗，非不因果。	以因緣隨俗，非不因果。	Because of following worldly convention through causes and conditions, it is not that there are no causes and effects.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b27_7']	眾生假名，非無佛性因、非無涅槃果。	眾生假名，非無佛性因、非無涅槃果。	The provisional name of sentient beings is not without the cause of buddha-nature, and is not without the effect of nirvana.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b28_9']	眾生生死名煩惱，五陰中生名我，假名行者名人。	眾生生死名煩惱，五陰中生名我，假名行者名人。	The birth and death of sentient beings is called afflictions. Being born within the five aggregates is called self. The one who practices provisionally is called a person.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336b29_9']	意識名知者，眼識為見者，命根不斷名壽者。	意識名知者，眼識為見者，命根不斷名壽者。	Consciousness is called the knower. Visual consciousness is the seer. The life faculty that is not cut off is called the one who lives.

['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336c01_16']	於五陰中見我所者，明生空竟。	於五陰中見我所者，明生空竟。	Seeing what belongs to the self within the five aggregates clarifies the emptiness of beings.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336c03_3']	第二明法空，文云一切苦受行空故者，觀五陰內一切苦皆空。	第二明法空，文云一切苦受行空故者，觀五陰內一切苦皆空。	Second, clarifying the emptiness of phenomena. The text says because all suffering and receiving are empty, contemplating that all suffering within the five aggregates is empty.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336c04_12']	五陰和合名法集，以無其實名幻化，五陰本來清淨故云無含無散。	五陰和合名法集，以無其實名幻化，五陰本來清淨故云無含無散。	The combination of the five aggregates is called the accumulation of phenomena. Because it lacks reality, it is called an illusion. The five aggregates are originally pure, therefore it says without inclusion and without dispersion.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336c05_14']	體知五陰即是真如，故云法同法性寂然空故。	體知五陰即是真如，故云法同法性寂然空故。	The essence knows that the five skandhas are precisely true suchness, therefore it says the Dharma is the same as the nature of Dharma, quiescent and empty.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336c07_8']	第三明境空，文云法境界空，能觀之心既淨，所觀之境亦空，故云境界空。	第三明境空，文云法境界空，能觀之心既淨，所觀之境亦空，故云境界空。	Third, clarifying the emptiness of objects. The text says the Dharma realm is empty. Since the observing mind is already pure, the observed objects are also empty, therefore it says the realm is empty.
['ZH_T33_1707_02b:0336c08_3']	實相門中無相不相，故云空無相。	實相門中無相不相，故云空無相。	Within the gate of true suchness there are no characteristics and no absence of characteristics, therefore it says empty and without characteristics.
