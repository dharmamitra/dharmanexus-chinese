Therefore, each drop is vastly different from the hundred rivers, which is to use the superior to reveal the inferior.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0070c22_18']	如海有百川之水，水義同也。	如海有百川之水，水義同也。	010	It is like the ocean having the waters of a hundred rivers, the meaning of water being the same.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0070c23_10']	後總揀者，約無其所局。	後總揀者，約無其所局。	010	Later, generally excluding is based on what is not common.

In the initial teaching, there are five natures and three vehicles. In the final teaching, it does not speak of the comprehensive inclusion of virtues and functions. In the sudden teaching, both phenomena and principles are completely severed, etc.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0070c28_4']	如彼百川不同鹹味、不具十德，海則具之，一次、二不宿、三餘水入中、四普同、五無、六深、七廣、八大身、九潮、十普受大雨。	如彼百川不同鹹味、不具十德，海則具之，一次、二不宿、三餘水入中、四普同、五無、六深、七廣、八大身、九潮、十普受大雨。	010	Just as the hundreds of rivers have different tastes and do not possess the ten virtues, the ocean possesses them all.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0071a03_7']	二中，言「同教」者，謂終頓二教雖說一性一相、無二無三，不辯圓融具德、事事無礙，故非別教。	二中，言「同教」者，謂終頓二教雖說一性一相、無二無三，不辯圓融具德、事事無礙，故非別教。	010	In the second part, it says Shared teaching refers to the fact that although the final and sudden teachings speak of the one nature, one characteristic, non-duality, and non-triality, they do not discern the perfect interfusion of virtues, and the unobstructedness of all phenomena. Therefore, they are not the distinct teaching.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0071a04_12']	而別教中有一性一相、事理無礙，言思斯絕，同彼二教。	而別教中有一性一相、事理無礙，言思斯絕，同彼二教。	010	However, within the distinct teaching, there is the one nature, one characteristic, the unobstructedness of phenomena and principle, and the cessation of verbalization and conceptualization, which is the same as those two teachings.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0071a05_4']	疏「以別該同」下，三通妨難。	疏「以別該同」下，三通妨難。	010	The commentary states Using the distinct to encompass the shared and below, third, it resolves doubts.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0071a06_1']	既同頓同實，何異頓實？	既同頓同實，何異頓實？	010	Since they are the same in suddenness and reality, how are they different from sudden and real?
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0071a06_6']	故此通云：	故此通云：	010	Therefore, this is generally said:
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0071a08_1']	即此同中必有別義，如事理無礙必有事事無礙耳，猶彼江水，入海亦鹹。	即此同中必有別義，如事理無礙必有事事無礙耳，猶彼江水，入海亦鹹。	010	Within this sameness, there must be a separate meaning. Like the unobstructedness of principle and phenomena, there must be the unobstructedness of phenomena and phenomena. It is like the river water entering the ocean and becoming salty.

This statement is also not accepted. Utterly absent and without any basis, words and understanding do not reach it, because giving rise to thoughts and movements goes against the essence of the Dharma.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0072a08_2']	彼所以立者，以第四泯絕無寄泯前三故，故名真空絕相。	彼所以立者，以第四泯絕無寄泯前三故，故名真空絕相。	010	The reason it is established there is because the fourth, the utter extinction and utter non-reliance, obliterates the previous three, and is therefore called the emptiness of true suchness and the extinction of characteristics.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a16_10']	初云佛性者名第一義空，第一義空名為智慧者，即雙標空智。	初云佛性者名第一義空，第一義空名為智慧者，即雙標空智。	010	The first says, Buddha-nature is called the ultimate emptiness, and the ultimate emptiness is called wisdom, which is a double indication of emptiness and wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a17_16']	以第一義空該通心境故，明即是智慧，揀異瓦礫非情。	以第一義空該通心境故，明即是智慧，揀異瓦礫非情。	010	Because the emptiness of ultimate truth encompasses both mind and objects, it is said to be wisdom, distinguishing it from insentient things like tiles and pebbles.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a18_11']	從所言空者下，經自雙釋二義：	從所言空者下，經自雙釋二義：	010	From The so-called emptiness below, the sutra itself explains both meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a20_10']	所言空者，即是牒上第一義空，以空有雙絕方名第一義空，故云不見空與不空。	所言空者，即是牒上第一義空，以空有雙絕方名第一義空，故云不見空與不空。	010	The so-called emptiness is a restatement of the emptiness of ultimate truth. Only when both emptiness and existence are utterly severed can it be called the emptiness of ultimate truth, so it says one does not see emptiness and non-emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a22_10']	智者見空及與不空下，釋上智慧，經文稍略，若具應云所言智慧者能見於空及與不空。	智者見空及與不空下，釋上智慧，經文稍略，若具應云所言智慧者能見於空及與不空。	010	The wise see emptiness and non-emptiness explains the above wisdom. The sutra text is slightly abbreviated. If complete, it should say The so-called wisdom is able to see emptiness and non-emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a23_8']	故此中者字，非是人也，秖是牒詞。	故此中者字，非是人也，秖是牒詞。	010	Therefore, the word here in this context is not a person, but simply a restatement.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a28_8']	今以即智明空，故名第一義空。	今以即智明空，故名第一義空。	010	Now, by clarifying emptiness with wisdom, it is called the emptiness of ultimate truth.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073a29_11']	即空之智，方是常恒智性，不生故常、不滅故恒。	即空之智，方是常恒智性，不生故常、不滅故恒。	010	The wisdom of emptiness is precisely the nature of eternal wisdom, because it is unborn it is eternal, and because it is unceasing it is eternal.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073b05_15']	則知二藏亦不相離，以其佛性妄法不染故名為空，具恒沙妙德故名不空。	則知二藏亦不相離，以其佛性妄法不染故名為空，具恒沙妙德故名不空。	010	Then know that the two treasuries are also inseparable, because buddha-nature is not defiled by false dharmas it is called empty, and because it is endowed with the wondrous virtues of the sands of the Ganges it is called not empty.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073b06_15']	要空諸妄，方顯不空之德，故不相離。	要空諸妄，方顯不空之德，故不相離。	010	It is necessary to empty all false [dharmas] in order to reveal the virtues of non-emptiness, therefore they are inseparable.

Therefore, the initial statement is precisely the emptiness of ultimate truth.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073b10_7']	又云見一切空、不見不空，不名中道，中道者名為佛性。	又云見一切空、不見不空，不名中道，中道者名為佛性。	010	It is also said that seeing all as empty and not seeing as non-empty is not called the middle way. The middle way is called buddha-nature.

['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073b13_11']	故知一切空不空等言含於能所，約其所見空與不空即是中道佛性，約其能見即是智慧。	故知一切空不空等言含於能所，約其所見空與不空即是中道佛性，約其能見即是智慧。	010	Therefore, it should be known that all the words empty and non-empty include both the subject and object. In terms of the object seen, emptiness and non-emptiness are precisely the middle way and buddha-nature. In terms of the subject, it is precisely wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1736_010:0073b14_12']	若不雙見不識佛性，若見中道名見佛性。	若不雙見不識佛性，若見中道名見佛性。	010	If one does not see both, one does not recognize buddha-nature. If one sees the middle way, it is called seeing buddha-nature.
