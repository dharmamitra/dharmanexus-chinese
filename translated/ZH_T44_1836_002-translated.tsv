['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052a11_3']	非擇滅者，一真法界，本性清淨，不由擇力，斷滅所顯；	非擇滅者，一真法界，本性清淨，不由擇力，斷滅所顯；	Cessation not through discernment means the originally pure nature of the one true Dharma realm is not revealed through the power of discernment severing and ceasing;

This is named after what manifests it, hence it is called immovable.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052a15_16']	想受滅者，無所有處想受不行所顯真理，立此名爾。	想受滅者，無所有處想受不行所顯真理，立此名爾。	Cessation of conceptualization and sensation refers to the truth manifested by the non-functioning of conceptualization and sensation in the sphere of nothingness. The name is established in this way.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052a17_10']	真如者，理非妄倒，故名真如，真簡於妄，如簡於倒，遍計、依他，如次應知。	真如者，理非妄倒，故名真如，真簡於妄，如簡於倒，遍計、依他，如次應知。	Suchness means the principle is not false or inverted, hence it is called suchness. Such distinguishes it from the false, and ness distinguishes it from the inverted. The imagined and dependent natures should be understood in sequence.

['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052a25_20']	一、補特伽羅無我，梵言補特伽羅，唐言數取趣，謂諸有情數數起惑造業，即為能取因也，當來五趣，名為所取果也，雖復數數起惑造業，五趣輪轉，都無主宰實自在用，故言無我。	一、補特伽羅無我，梵言補特伽羅，唐言數取趣，謂諸有情數數起惑造業，即為能取因也，當來五趣，名為所取果也，雖復數數起惑造業，五趣輪轉，都無主宰實自在用，故言無我。	First, the non-self of persons. The Sanskrit term pudgala means one who repeatedly grasps and takes rebirth. It refers to sentient beings who repeatedly give rise to afflictions and create karma, which are the causes of grasping. In the future, they will take rebirth in the five destinies, which are the results of what is grasped. Although they repeatedly give rise to afflictions and create karma, transmigrating through the five destinies, there is no real controller or sovereign power. Therefore, it is said to be non-self.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052a26_10']	乃補特伽羅，即無我矣。	乃補特伽羅，即無我矣。	The pudgala is precisely non-self.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052a27_2']	此所無即我，是為我空也。	此所無即我，是為我空也。	The absence of self is precisely the emptiness of self.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052a29_1']	彼凡夫等，皆執心外實有諸法，又執此法有實主宰，此說為無，無即彼空，無別體也。	彼凡夫等，皆執心外實有諸法，又執此法有實主宰，此說為無，無即彼空，無別體也。	Ordinary beings all grasp at real dharmas outside of the mind, and also grasp at these dharmas as having real control. This is said to be non-existent. The non-existence is precisely their emptiness, without any separate substance.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b01_5']	二，法無我。	二，法無我。	Second, the non-self of dharmas.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b02_18']	言法者，軌持之義，謂諸法體，雖復任持，軌生物解，亦無勝性實自在用故。	言法者，軌持之義，謂諸法體，雖復任持，軌生物解，亦無勝性實自在用故。	As for the term dharma, it means that which guides and upholds. It refers to the essence of all dharmas, which although they uphold and guide the arising of understanding in beings, they also lack any superior nature or real sovereign power.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b04_4']	言法無我，法即無我，應云法無法，從能依說，故云法無我。	言法無我，法即無我，應云法無法，從能依說，故云法無我。	As for the non-self of dharmas, dharmas are themselves non-self. It should be said that dharmas have no self, but it is said that dharmas are non-self, following the basis of designation.

['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b07_6']	補特伽羅無我者，離一切緣生行外別有實我不可得故。	補特伽羅無我者，離一切緣生行外別有實我不可得故。	The non-self of persons means that apart from all conditioned activities, a real self cannot be found.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b08_10']	法無我者，謂一切緣生諸行性非實我，是無常故。	法無我者，謂一切緣生諸行性非實我，是無常故。	The non-self of dharmas means that all conditioned activities are by nature not real selves, because they are impermanent.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b09_6']	如是二種，略攝為一雙證二無我理。	如是二種，略攝為一雙證二無我理。	These two kinds are summarized as one, and both realize the principle of non-self.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b09_20']	彼處指《毘曇》說此名為大空。	彼處指《毘曇》說此名為大空。	That place refers to the Abhidharma teachings, which are called great emptiness.

['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b10_6']	「我之執者，心得境名。	「我之執者，心得境名。	The grasping of self is the mind obtaining an object and being named.

['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b11_14']	「二執者，我狹法寬，蓋人有迷人必迷法者，迷法未必迷人故。	「二執者，我狹法寬，蓋人有迷人必迷法者，迷法未必迷人故。	As for the two attachments, the self is narrow and the dharmas are broad. It is because there are people who are deluded about the self and must also be deluded about the dharmas, but being deluded about the dharmas does not necessarily mean being deluded about the self.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b13_14']	」能持自體者為法，有常一用者為人，如二乘我執已斷，法執猶存，則其淺深寬狹可見矣。	」能持自體者為法，有常一用者為人，如二乘我執已斷，法執猶存，則其淺深寬狹可見矣。	That which can uphold its own substance is considered a dharma, and that which has a constant and single function is considered a person. For example, when the self-attachment of the two vehicles has already been severed, the dharma-attachment still remains. Then, its shallowness and depth, and breadth and narrowness, can be seen.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b15_11']	蓋我法者，不出世間及聖教二種我法，謂世間人執我法，無體隨情，名世間假。	蓋我法者，不出世間及聖教二種我法，謂世間人執我法，無體隨情，名世間假。	In general, the self and dharmas are not beyond the two kinds of self and dharmas in the world and the holy teachings. The self and dharmas of the worldly person's attachment are without substance and follow emotions, and are called worldly fictions.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b16_6']	聖教我法者，有體強設，名之為假。	聖教我法者，有體強設，名之為假。	As for the self and dharmas of the holy teachings, they have a substance that is forcefully established, and are called fictions.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b16_18']	故二皆為假，故無我法也。	故二皆為假，故無我法也。	Therefore, both are fictions, and thus there is no self or dharmas.

It was only when Ārya-Vimuktisena first extracted them to form a treatise that it became a teaching that responds to capacities.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b25_13']	蓋教為機設，機之色心優劣，暨年數之賒促不齊，致使聖賢施教廣略有異，而大旨無殊焉。	蓋教為機設，機之色心優劣，暨年數之賒促不齊，致使聖賢施教廣略有異，而大旨無殊焉。	The teachings are established for the capacities of sentient beings. The superiority and inferiority of the mental states of sentient beings, and the differences in the length of their years, lead to the differences in the breadth of the teachings given by sages and worthies, but the great purport is not different.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052b27_5']	然而《瑜伽》總百軸，而於初三軸，翻覆展演六百六十餘法，奚翅二萬言；	然而《瑜伽》總百軸，而於初三軸，翻覆展演六百六十餘法，奚翅二萬言；	However, the Yoga Sūtra has a total of one hundred scrolls, and in the first three scrolls, it unfolds and develops more than six hundred and sixty dharmas, with nearly twenty thousand words;

The words are very concise, yet the meaning is even more complete. The text is not ornate, yet the principle is even more refined. As for the gateway to entering the Way, the sequence of cultivation and elimination, and the mutual presentation of the principles of defilement, purity, phenomena, and principle, it is completely and abundantly provided.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052c02_11']	於斯非具四無礙辯、大總持門者，其能與於是乎？	於斯非具四無礙辯、大總持門者，其能與於是乎？	In this regard, who can do this except one who possesses the four unobstructed eloquences and the great dhāraṇī gate?
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052c05_12']	嗟夫大賢憫物心切，務使人易知易從，而吾人為法者，固不可不知也，至於森然而諸法章，泯然而二我盡，則三乘聖賢之位可階矣。	嗟夫大賢憫物心切，務使人易知易從，而吾人為法者，固不可不知也，至於森然而諸法章，泯然而二我盡，則三乘聖賢之位可階矣。	Alas! The great sages' compassion for beings is urgent, striving to make it easy for people to understand and follow, and those of us who practice the Dharma should certainly not be unaware of this. As for the various Dharma chapters that are distinct and the two selves that are extinguished, then the stages of the sages and worthies of the Three Vehicles can be attained.

Although the degree of exhaustion and possession is different, when examining the nature that is exhausted and possessed, there is no difference.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052c11_12']	性既均而不以道責己責人者，彼己皆欺也。	性既均而不以道責己責人者，彼己皆欺也。	Since nature is the same, those who do not hold themselves and others accountable based on the Way are deceiving themselves and others.
['ZH_T44_1836_002:0052c13_4']	欺己之罪小，欺人之罪大，欺人之罪，又不若欺後多人之罪為尤大。	欺己之罪小，欺人之罪大，欺人之罪，又不若欺後多人之罪為尤大。	The sin of deceiving oneself is small, the sin of deceiving others is great, and the sin of deceiving others is not as great as the sin of deceiving many people in the future.
