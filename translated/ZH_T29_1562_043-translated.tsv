If the lesser afflictions occur frequently, even if one wishes to subdue and eliminate them, it is difficult to find an opportunity.

Therefore, the action of body and speech should be called heavy. If this is so, then there would be a great error.

Do not say that the action of body and speech is the cause and result of the volition that precedes it, and therefore they together produce retribution. If this is so, then there would be the error of not being loved.

It means that Devadatta first gave rise to evil desires, and because of this he should have fallen into an evil destiny. Next, he gave rise to the preparatory stage of action when he was about to destroy the Saṅgha. Because of this, he should have fallen into hell.

The meaning here is to show that the Buddha understands that Devadatta, having committed such grave evil karma, has severed all roots of goodness and has no sense of shame at all. How could I be able to save and heal him?
