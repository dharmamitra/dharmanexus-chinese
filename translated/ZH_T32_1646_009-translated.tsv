The precepts and rules of concentration and formlessness are also obtained simultaneously. Refraining from is called the wholesome path of action, which is non-action.

For example, a person of ten years increases their lifespan through the causes and conditions of refraining from killing.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0306b21_9']	又十不善業是實罪，故離名實福。	又十不善業是實罪，故離名實福。	009	Moreover, the ten unwholesome paths of action are real offenses, therefore refraining from them is called real blessings.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0306b22_13']	又後三善業是眾善之本，是故施等諸善皆業道所攝。	又後三善業是眾善之本，是故施等諸善皆業道所攝。	009	Moreover, the last three wholesome actions are the basis of all wholesome actions. Therefore, all wholesome actions such as giving are included in the path of action.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0306c07_8']	又行不善者，受呵㥽等諸苦惱分，又令他人得所惡事名為凶暴，是故應離此不善業。	又行不善者，受呵㥽等諸苦惱分，又令他人得所惡事名為凶暴，是故應離此不善業。	009	Moreover, one who practices unwholesomeness experiences scolding and other sufferings, and also causes others to obtain detestable things, which is called violent. Therefore, one should avoid this unwholesome karma.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0306c14_16']	如是以十善道乃得人身，但不行善尚為大失，況起惡業。	如是以十善道乃得人身，但不行善尚為大失，況起惡業。	009	In this way, by the ten wholesome paths one obtains a human body, but if one does not practice goodness, it is still a great loss, let alone creating evil karma.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0306c16_13']	又行不善者，雖自愛身而實不自愛，雖自護身實非自護，以起自惱業因緣故。	又行不善者，雖自愛身而實不自愛，雖自護身實非自護，以起自惱業因緣故。	009	Moreover, one who practices unwholesomeness, although loving one's body, actually does not love oneself, and although protecting one's body, it is not truly protecting oneself, because one creates the causes and conditions for the karma of self-affliction.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0306c28_9']	放逸如怨，能害善法，故不應隨。	放逸如怨，能害善法，故不應隨。	009	Negligence is like an enemy, able to harm wholesome dharmas, therefore one should not follow it.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a01_6']	又不善業，諸佛菩薩、應真賢聖、五通神仙及明罪福者無不呵毀，故不應造。	又不善業，諸佛菩薩、應真賢聖、五通神仙及明罪福者無不呵毀，故不應造。	009	Moreover, all unwholesome actions are not praised by Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, sages with the five supernatural powers, and those who understand the distinction between good and evil, therefore one should not create them.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a03_14']	以此等緣故知不善有無量患。	以此等緣故知不善有無量患。	009	For these reasons, one should know that unwholesomeness has innumerable faults.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a10_12']	又身口能成辦事，如人發心殺此眾生，要以身口能成其事，非但意業得殺生罪，亦非但發心得起塔寺梵福德也。	又身口能成辦事，如人發心殺此眾生，要以身口能成其事，非但意業得殺生罪，亦非但發心得起塔寺梵福德也。	009	Moreover, body and speech can accomplish things, just as when a person intends to kill a certain being, they must use body and speech to accomplish the task. It is not that one can obtain the sin of killing life merely through mental action, nor is it that one can obtain the merit of building a stupa and making Brahma offerings merely through intention.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a12_11']	又若無身口但意業者則無果報，如人發心我當布施，而實不與，則無施福。	又若無身口但意業者則無果報，如人發心我當布施，而實不與，則無施福。	009	Moreover, if there were only mental action without body and speech, then there would be no retribution, just as when a person intends to give a gift, but does not actually give it, then there is no merit of giving.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a14_2']	又非但隨願事得成辦，如人發願為大施會，而實不與，則無會福；	又非但隨願事得成辦，如人發願為大施會，而實不與，則無會福；	009	Moreover, things are not accomplished merely by following one's wishes, just as when a person makes a vow to hold a great giving assembly, but does not actually give, then there is no merit of the assembly;
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a15_1']	若心業大者應得施福，然則業報錯亂。	若心業大者應得施福，然則業報錯亂。	009	if the mental action were great, one should obtain the merit of giving, but then the retribution of action would be confused.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a16_1']	又比尼中無意犯罪，若意業大，何故不犯？	又比尼中無意犯罪，若意業大，何故不犯？	009	Moreover, in the Vinaya there is no offense of mental action. If mental action is great, why is it not an offense?
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a17_13']	又若發心便得福者，福則易得，行者何故捨此易業而為施等難行業耶？	又若發心便得福者，福則易得，行者何故捨此易業而為施等難行業耶？	009	Moreover, if one obtains merit by simply giving rise to the intention, then merit would be easily obtained. Why do practitioners abandon this easy practice and engage in the difficult practices of giving and so forth?
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a19_3']	又若然者，則福無盡，如人但空發心，竟無所用，何所盡也？	又若然者，則福無盡，如人但空發心，竟無所用，何所盡也？	009	Moreover, if it were so, then merit would be inexhaustible. It is like a person who merely gives rise to the intention, with nothing actually being used. What could be exhausted?
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a19_13']	以財物有量故福可盡。	以財物有量故福可盡。	009	Because material goods have limits, merit can be exhausted.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a22_14']	又世間人衰利大甚，以心輕躁難制伏故，無惡不起則己受重衰；	又世間人衰利大甚，以心輕躁難制伏故，無惡不起則己受重衰；	009	Moreover, for worldly people, decline and prosperity are very great. Because the mind is fickle and difficult to control, if there is no evil that arises, then one will experience grave decline;

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307a27_1']	但一發心便得罪故。	但一發心便得罪故。	009	Because just one thought can lead to offenses.

By these four things one commits an offense. One should know that it is not considered serious if it is done by mental action.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307b10_8']	故知意業為重。	故知意業為重。	009	Therefore, we know that mental actions are grave.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307b11_14']	又意差別故身口業有差別，如上中下等，離心無身口業。	又意差別故身口業有差別，如上中下等，離心無身口業。	009	Moreover, because the mind is differentiated, bodily and verbal actions have distinctions, such as superior, middling, and inferior. Apart from the mind, there are no bodily and verbal actions.

If the mind relies on the body and mouth to practice good and evil, it is called bodily and verbal karma. Apart from mental karma, there is retribution for bodily and verbal karma. Apart from mental karma, the body and mouth have no retribution. Therefore, we know that mental karma is heavy, not bodily and verbal karma.

Because the intention is heavy and the matter is heavy, the karma is heavy, not because the body and mouth are heavy, it is heavy.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307c12_6']	汝言身口能辦事者，是亦不然，以事訖名辦，若奪他命已得殺生罪，非起身口業時，事訖時要須心力，是故非身口也。	汝言身口能辦事者，是亦不然，以事訖名辦，若奪他命已得殺生罪，非起身口業時，事訖時要須心力，是故非身口也。	009	You say that body and speech can accomplish things, but this is also unreasonable. Accomplishment is called completion. If one takes the life of another, one obtains the offense of killing, not when one begins bodily and verbal actions. When the matter is completed, it is necessary to rely on the power of the mind. Therefore, it is not body and speech.

If one gives rise to an evil mind, one immediately commits an offense. As the Buddha said, there are three kinds of offenses: offenses of body, speech, and mind. Therefore, one should know that merely giving rise to an evil mind does not mean there is no offense, but the precepts are not established [for mental offenses] because they are difficult to observe.
['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307c20_3']	麁罪持戒能遮，細罪定等能除。	麁罪持戒能遮，細罪定等能除。	009	Gross offenses can be prevented by upholding the precepts, while subtle offenses can be eliminated by concentration and other [means].

But because sentient beings have weak intellectual power, they are unable to practice the mental activity of loving-kindness and so forth, so they engage in giving and other [practices]. It is difficult to attain a pure mind by giving flowers, incense, and other offerings.

['ZH_T32_1646_009:0307c28_1']	汝言意業無所損益，是事不然，以身口業皆為意業所導故不名勝，以隨力所起是則為勝。	汝言意業無所損益，是事不然，以身口業皆為意業所導故不名勝，以隨力所起是則為勝。	009	You say that the mind does not harm or benefit, but this is not so.

All will be natural and not require effort. Therefore, we know that the merit of compassion is the most profound and thick.

All of these are answered in general, namely, the methods of bodily and verbal actions are different, and the methods of mental actions are different.

Due to evil karma, one experiences various sufferings such as being beaten, captured, bound, whipped, and killed. Due to good karma, one experiences pleasures such as fame, profit, and respect.

Good people must know that killing, etc. have bad consequences, so they condemn them and do not do them. If they knew there were no bad consequences, why would they abandon them?
