['ZH_T31_1598_005:0405c27_2']	由名前覺無，稱體相違故；	由名前覺無，稱體相違故；	005	Because there is no cognition before the name, it contradicts its essence;
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0405c27_14']	由名有眾多，多體相違故；	由名有眾多，多體相違故；	005	Because there are many names, it contradicts many essences;
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0405c28_5']	由名不決定，雜體相違故。	由名不決定，雜體相違故。	005	Because the name is not definite, it contradicts a mixed essence.

['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a01_13']	成稱體多體，　　雜體相違故。	成稱體多體，　　雜體相違故。	005	It is established that it contradicts the essence, many essences, and a mixed essence.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a02_0']	法無而可得，　　無染而有淨，	法無而可得，　　無染而有淨，	005	Dharmas are nonexistent yet can be obtained, uncontaminated yet have purity,

['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a05_4']	如依他起，遍計所執分雖顯現可得，而非稱彼體。	如依他起，遍計所執分雖顯現可得，而非稱彼體。	005	As for the dependent nature, although the imagined part appears and can be obtained, it does not correspond to its essence.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a05_18']	為顯此義，故說由名前覺無等。	為顯此義，故說由名前覺無等。	005	In order to illustrate this meaning, it is said that awareness of it precedes the name, which is unprecedented.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a07_8']	若依他起與遍計所執同一相者，離取其名，於遍計所執應生其覺。	若依他起與遍計所執同一相者，離取其名，於遍計所執應生其覺。	005	If the dependent on others and the imagined have the same characteristic, then apart from grasping its name, one should give rise to awareness of the imagined.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a08_16']	如不可說自所領受現量所得依他起中，不待於名而生其覺。	如不可說自所領受現量所得依他起中，不待於名而生其覺。	005	Just as in the dependent on others that is directly perceived by oneself, one does not depend on a name to give rise to awareness.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a10_1']	既無此事，故依他起、遍計所執其體相稱，與理相違。	既無此事，故依他起、遍計所執其體相稱，與理相違。	005	Since this is not the case, the dependent on others and the imagined have a corresponding essence, which contradicts reason.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a12_9']	由名有眾多多體相違故者，由意解力，依他起中計度於義，於一義中立眾多名，如尼犍荼書一物立多名。	由名有眾多多體相違故者，由意解力，依他起中計度於義，於一義中立眾多名，如尼犍荼書一物立多名。	005	The reason that the many names contradict the one essence is that due to the power of understanding, one imagines an object within the dependent on others. One establishes many names for a single object, just as in the Nirgrantha scriptures, one thing is given many names.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a13_15']	於一牛上立種種名，非於一物有多自性而不相違故。	於一牛上立種種名，非於一物有多自性而不相違故。	005	On a single cow, one establishes various names, but on a single thing, there is not a multiplicity of essences that are not contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a14_8']	依他起、遍計所執不同一相。	依他起、遍計所執不同一相。	005	Therefore, the dependent on others and the imagined do not have the same characteristic.

For many kinds of things, according to one's desire, a name is established. Also, one kind of name, according to place and time, separately designates various meanings. If the name and meaning have the same characteristic, the meaning should be mixed.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a17_18']	既無此事，故不如名而有其義。	既無此事，故不如名而有其義。	005	Since this is not the case, therefore it is not like the name and has its meaning.

['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a23_18']	此若無者，圓成實自性亦無所有，此若無者則一切皆無。	此若無者，圓成實自性亦無所有，此若無者則一切皆無。	005	If this were nonexistent, the perfected nature would also be nonexistent. If this were nonexistent, then everything would be nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a25_3']	若依他起及圓成實自性無有，應成無有染淨過失。	若依他起及圓成實自性無有，應成無有染淨過失。	005	If the dependent and perfected natures did not exist, there would be the error of being completely devoid of defilement and purity.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a26_2']	既現可得雜染清淨，是故不應一切皆無。	既現可得雜染清淨，是故不應一切皆無。	005	Since defilement and purity are both perceived, therefore one should not say that everything is nonexistent.

['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406a28_13']	一切種若無，　　恒時無染淨。	一切種若無，　　恒時無染淨。	005	If all kinds do not exist, there is no defilement or purity at any time.

['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406b01_19']	又一切者，謂一切時。	又一切者，謂一切時。	005	All means at all times.

['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406b03_17']	二性若無，圓成實性最應成就。	二性若無，圓成實性最應成就。	005	If the other two natures do not exist, the perfected nature should be accomplished.
['ZH_T31_1598_005:0406b04_2']	何故言無？	何故言無？	005	Why is it said to not exist?
