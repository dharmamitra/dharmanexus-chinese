If in the final neither-perception-nor-non-perception concentration they are able to realize that it is not nirvāṇa, this person will definitely attain the path of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549b07_2']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?

It is false and unreal. Although there are no coarse afflictions, it still accomplishes ten kinds of subtle afflictions.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549b09_16']	知已破折，不住不著，心得解脫，即證三乘涅槃故。	知已破折，不住不著，心得解脫，即證三乘涅槃故。	Knowing this, one dismantles and does not dwell or attach, and the mind attains liberation, thus realizing the nirvāṇa of the three vehicles.

['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549b19_14']	凡夫修非想時，觀有想處如癕、如瘡，觀無想處如癡也。	凡夫修非想時，觀有想處如癕、如瘡，觀無想處如癡也。	When ordinary beings cultivate the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, they observe the sphere of perception as a boil, as a sore, and observe the sphere of non-perception as delusion.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549b20_5']	第一妙定，名曰「非想」。	第一妙定，名曰「非想」。	The first sublime concentration is called neither-perception-nor-non-perception.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549b21_17']	作是念已，即棄捨有想、無想，名「非有想非無想」，故知非想即是兩捨之義。	作是念已，即棄捨有想、無想，名「非有想非無想」，故知非想即是兩捨之義。	Having had this thought, one immediately abandons the notion of existence and non-existence, and is called neither existent nor non-existent. Therefore, we know that non-thought is the meaning of abandoning both.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549b23_8']	今佛弟子觀行破折，義如前說，是故深觀棄捨，不著非想，能得涅槃。	今佛弟子觀行破折，義如前說，是故深觀棄捨，不著非想，能得涅槃。	Now, the Buddha's disciples contemplate and break down, the meaning is as explained above. Therefore, deeply contemplating and abandoning, not attached to non-thought, one can attain nirvana.

If the practitioner skillfully uses wisdom to break down and return to the origin, then emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, the four truths, the twelve links of dependent arising, and the correct observation of the middle way will arise, and one will thereby enter nirvana.

['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549c25_6']	修數者，行者調和氣息，不澁不滑，安詳徐數，從一至十，攝心在數，不令馳散，是名修數。	修數者，行者調和氣息，不澁不滑，安詳徐數，從一至十，攝心在數，不令馳散，是名修數。	As for the number of practices, the practitioner harmonizes the breath, neither rough nor smooth, slowly counts from one to ten, focuses the mind on the count, and prevents it from wandering. This is called practicing the count.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549c26_19']	證數者，覺心任運，從一至十，不加功力，心住息緣，覺息虛微，心相漸細。	證數者，覺心任運，從一至十，不加功力，心住息緣，覺息虛微，心相漸細。	As for the number of realizations, the mind of awareness naturally goes from one to ten, without the need for effort. The mind abides in the object of the breath, and the breath is felt to be subtle and light, while the mind becomes increasingly subtle.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549c27_8']	患數為麁，意不欲數。	患數為麁，意不欲數。	The practitioner feels that counting is coarse, and the mind does not wish to count.
['ZH_T46_1917_001:0549c28_1']	爾時行者應當放數修隨。	爾時行者應當放數修隨。	At that time, the practitioner should abandon counting and practice following.
