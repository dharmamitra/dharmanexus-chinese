['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c25_12']	今是第二七品破法明於法空。	今是第二七品破法明於法空。	02b	Now, this is the second part, which refutes [the existence of] dharmas to clarify the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c26_7']	若利根者既知無人即悟無法。	若利根者既知無人即悟無法。	02b	If one has sharp faculties, then upon understanding that there is no person, one will realize that there are no dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c26_12']	所以然者。	所以然者。	02b	The reason for this is as follows.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c26_17']	人本法末。	人本法末。	02b	People are the basis, and dharmas are the branches.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c27_4']	本無故末即無。	本無故末即無。	02b	Since the basis does not exist, the branches are also non-existent.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c27_14']	二人法相待無人可待。	二人法相待無人可待。	02b	Second, since there is no person, there is also no dharma that can be relied upon.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c27_19']	即知無法。	即知無法。	02b	One should understand that there are no dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c28_5']	但鈍根未悟。	但鈍根未悟。	02b	However, those with dull faculties have not yet realized this.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c28_18']	雖知無人猶言有法故次破法。	雖知無人猶言有法故次破法。	02b	Although they understand that there is no person, they still say that there are dharmas. Therefore, [the existence of] dharmas is refuted next.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c29_7']	又外道神病未除。	又外道神病未除。	02b	Moreover, the illness of the non-Buddhist's [belief in the existence of] a person has not yet been cured.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c29_12']	上就神救。	上就神救。	02b	Above, [the existence of] a person was used as a means of salvation.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0270c29_18']	神義既不立。	神義既不立。	02b	Since the meaning of [the existence of] a person has not been established,
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a01_7']	自此已下舉法證神。	自此已下舉法證神。	02b	from here onward, [the existence of] dharmas is used as evidence for [the existence of] a person.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a01_16']	今破無法為顯無神。	今破無法為顯無神。	02b	Now, [the existence of] dharmas is refuted in order to reveal the non-existence of a person.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a02_2']	故次破法。	故次破法。	02b	Therefore, [the existence of] dharmas is refuted next.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a02_12']	問何故前破神後破法。	問何故前破神後破法。	02b	Question: Why is [the existence of] a person refuted first and [the existence of] dharmas refuted later?
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a02_18']	答智度論云。	答智度論云。	02b	Answer: The Dazhidulun says:
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a03_12']	世間顛倒如亂糸相繫無定詮緒。	世間顛倒如亂糸相繫無定詮緒。	02b	The inversions of the world are like tangled threads bound together, without a fixed sequence.

['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a04_3']	有病則治。	有病則治。	02b	If there is a disease, then it is treated.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a04_9']	故無定次第。	故無定次第。	02b	Therefore, there is no fixed sequence.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a05_4']	二者欲顯論雖有三破內外二病。	二者欲顯論雖有三破內外二病。	02b	Second, although the treatise has three parts, it refutes the internal and external diseases.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a05_14']	中論十二門破其內病。	中論十二門破其內病。	02b	The Twelve Gates Treatise refutes the internal disease.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a06_4']	前破於法後傍破人。	前破於法後傍破人。	02b	It first refutes the Dharma and then refutes the person indirectly.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a07_5']	正以佛之弟子多識無我而著於法故前破法。	正以佛之弟子多識無我而著於法故前破法。	02b	This is because the disciples of the Buddha mostly recognize no-self but are attached to the Dharma, so the Dharma is refuted first.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a07_16']	故少有計人故後傍破人。	故少有計人故後傍破人。	02b	There are few who reckon the person, so the person is refuted indirectly later.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a08_4']	此論破外道病。	此論破外道病。	02b	This treatise refutes the disease of the non-Buddhist path.

['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a09_4']	但人為其本故先破人。	但人為其本故先破人。	02b	But since the person is the basis, it is first refuted.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a09_12']	三者依二空次第。	三者依二空次第。	02b	Third, it relies on the sequence of the two emptinesses.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a10_2']	生空易得故前破人。	生空易得故前破人。	02b	The emptiness of beings is easy to attain, so the person is refuted first.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a10_11']	法空難得故後破法。	法空難得故後破法。	02b	The emptiness of dharmas is difficult to attain, so the Dharma is refuted later.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a10_18']	此義通大小乘。	此義通大小乘。	02b	This meaning is common to both the Great and Lesser Vehicles.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a11_11']	小乘中如成論等前以陰除人。	小乘中如成論等前以陰除人。	02b	In the Lesser Vehicle, like the Satyasiddhi Śāstra, the aggregates are used to eliminate the person first.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a11_18']	次明以空除陰。	次明以空除陰。	02b	Next, it clarifies using emptiness to eliminate the aggregates.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a12_10']	大乘前明菩薩得眾生空。	大乘前明菩薩得眾生空。	02b	In the Mahayana, it is first explained that bodhisattvas attain the emptiness of sentient beings.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a12_16']	次得法空也。	次得法空也。	02b	Next, they attain the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a13_6']	又先破人後破法者。	又先破人後破法者。	02b	Moreover, the reason for first refuting the person and then refuting dharmas is
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a14_2']	如大品諸方等經多以我喻萬法。	如大品諸方等經多以我喻萬法。	02b	that in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra and other vaipulya sūtras, the self is often used as a metaphor for myriad dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a14_6']	今亦爾。	今亦爾。	02b	Now it is also like this.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a14_19']	前我不可得故後舉我例法也。	前我不可得故後舉我例法也。	02b	Since the self cannot be found, the self is used as an example to illustrate dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a15_9']	問大小二空云何同異。	問大小二空云何同異。	02b	Question: How are the two kinds of emptiness, small and great, the same and different?

['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a16_4']	有假名人有陰實法。	有假名人有陰實法。	02b	There is a nominally existent person and there are real dharmas of the aggregates.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a16_14']	故以實過假以空過實。	故以實過假以空過實。	02b	Therefore, the real is used to surpass the nominal and emptiness is used to surpass the real.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a17_5']	故成實師明空無我行。	故成實師明空無我行。	02b	Therefore, the Chengshi masters clarify the practice of emptiness and non-self.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a17_10']	引論文云。	引論文云。	02b	Citing a treatise, it says:
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a18_2']	五陰中不見眾生為空行。	五陰中不見眾生為空行。	02b	Not seeing sentient beings in the five aggregates is the practice of emptiness.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a18_11']	見陰亦無為無我行。	見陰亦無為無我行。	02b	Seeing that the aggregates also do not exist is the practice of non-self.

['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a19_10']	人法未曾是有亦未曾無亦有亦無。	人法未曾是有亦未曾無亦有亦無。	02b	The person and dharmas have never existed and have never been non-existent, and are both existent and non-existent.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a19_15', 'ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a20_9']	如是五句。🔽但為眾生偏著有病是故明空。	如是五句。 但為眾生偏著有病是故明空。	02b	Such five propositions🔽are only for sentient beings who are biased towards the illness of existence, therefore emptiness is clarified.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a20_18']	有病若除空義亦捨。	有病若除空義亦捨。	02b	If the illness of existence is removed, the meaning of emptiness is also abandoned.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a21_8']	適化所宜教無定相。	適化所宜教無定相。	02b	The teachings are given according to what is suitable, and there is no fixed form.

['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a23_5']	一者依楞伽等經攝大乘等論。	一者依楞伽等經攝大乘等論。	02b	First, it relies on the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and other sūtras, and the Mahāyānasaṃgraha and other treatises.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a24_2']	明二乘但得人無我菩薩得法無我。	明二乘但得人無我菩薩得法無我。	02b	It clarifies that the two vehicles only attain the selflessness of persons, while bodhisattvas attain the selflessness of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a24_10']	則前破人明小乘。	則前破人明小乘。	02b	Then, the previous refutation of persons clarifies the Hinayana.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a24_17']	今破法明大乘。	今破法明大乘。	02b	Now, the refutation of dharmas clarifies the Mahayana.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a25_8']	二者今明二空俱是大乘。	二者今明二空俱是大乘。	02b	Second, it is now clarified that the two kinds of emptiness are both the Mahayana.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a25_15']	三者俱是小乘。	三者俱是小乘。	02b	Third, they are both the Hinayana.

['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a26_15']	答邪言具障大小。	答邪言具障大小。	02b	The answer is that false words completely obstruct both the Mahayana and Hinayana.
['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271a27_6']	今破一切邪顯一切正。	今破一切邪顯一切正。	02b	Now, by refuting everything false, one reveals everything correct.

['ZH_T42_1827_02b:0271b01_4']	如大乘經初具大小始名大乘。	如大乘經初具大小始名大乘。	02b	Just as a Mahayana sūtra is called the Mahayana only when it initially presents both the Mahayana and Hinayana.
