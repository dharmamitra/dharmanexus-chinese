['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b16_2']	初禪中雖有諸識，非苦根所依。	初禪中雖有諸識，非苦根所依。	013	Although there are various consciousnesses in the first dhyāna, they are not the basis of the faculty of suffering.

['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b19_1']	今何故說二禪中苦根滅？	今何故說二禪中苦根滅？	013	Why is it said now that the faculty of suffering is extinguished in the second trance state?
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b19_4']	答曰：	答曰：	013	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b21_1']	初禪近不定心，不定心者能生欲界繫諸識，於中生苦根，是故不說初禪苦滅。	初禪近不定心，不定心者能生欲界繫諸識，於中生苦根，是故不說初禪苦滅。	013	The first trance state is close to the indeterminate mind. The indeterminate mind is able to give rise to the consciousnesses bound to the desire realm, and suffering arises from it. Therefore, it is not said that suffering is extinguished in the first trance state.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b21_4']	問曰：	問曰：	013	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b22_8']	若爾，初禪亦近憂根，是憂根亦應說若第二第三禪滅。	若爾，初禪亦近憂根，是憂根亦應說若第二第三禪滅。	013	If that is so, then the first trance state is also close to the faculty of sorrow. The faculty of sorrow should also be said to be extinguished in the second and third trance states.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b22_11']	答曰：	答曰：	013	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b24_3']	依欲憂根從依欲喜生，得淨喜則不淨喜滅，是故初禪中無憂根。	依欲憂根從依欲喜生，得淨喜則不淨喜滅，是故初禪中無憂根。	013	The faculty of sorrow bound to the desire realm arises from the joy bound to the desire realm. When one obtains pure joy, impure joy is extinguished. Therefore, there is no faculty of sorrow in the first trance state.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b25_4']	依不定生苦根，初禪近散心故不名為滅。	依不定生苦根，初禪近散心故不名為滅。	013	The faculty of suffering arises based on the indeterminate. Because the first trance state is close to the scattered mind, it is not said to be extinguished.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b26_10']	又如三禪無苦，亦說斷苦樂故入第四禪，是事亦爾。	又如三禪無苦，亦說斷苦樂故入第四禪，是事亦爾。	013	Also, just as the third dhyāna is without suffering, it is also said that by cutting off suffering and pleasure one enters the fourth dhyāna. This matter is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b28_3']	又行者於初禪中定未具足，常為覺觀所亂，故說二禪滅諸覺觀。	又行者於初禪中定未具足，常為覺觀所亂，故說二禪滅諸覺觀。	013	Moreover, for the practitioner, the concentration in the first dhyāna is not yet complete, and it is always disturbed by initial and sustained thought. Therefore, it is said that in the second dhyāna one extinguishes initial and sustained thought.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b29_11']	內淨者二禪攝心深，故散亂常不得入，內無亂心故名內淨。	內淨者二禪攝心深，故散亂常不得入，內無亂心故名內淨。	013	Purity of mind means that in the second dhyāna the mind is deeply concentrated, so that distraction can never enter. Because there is no distracted mind within, it is called purity of mind.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341b29_18']	是二禪體一心。	是二禪體一心。	013	This is the essence of the second dhyāna, a single-pointed mind.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c01_9']	無覺無觀者，一心名。	無覺無觀者，一心名。	013	Without initial thought and without sustained thought is a name for a single-pointed mind.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c02_4']	心行一道亦名為禪，即是內淨。	心行一道亦名為禪，即是內淨。	013	The mind traveling on a single path is also called dhyāna, which is precisely the purity of mind.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c03_13']	得此深定故覺觀不生，不如初禪心數在覺觀，故說無覺無觀。	得此深定故覺觀不生，不如初禪心數在覺觀，故說無覺無觀。	013	Because one attains this deep concentration, initial and sustained thought do not arise. Unlike in the first dhyāna where the mental factors are in initial and sustained thought, it is said to be without initial thought and without sustained thought.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c04_9']	定生喜樂者，初禪以離故得喜。	定生喜樂者，初禪以離故得喜。	013	The arising of joy and pleasure through concentration means that in the first dhyāna one attains joy through separation.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c05_4']	此中定成就故得喜，故曰定生。	此中定成就故得喜，故曰定生。	013	Here, because the concentration is accomplished, one attains joy. Therefore, it is said to be born from concentration.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c05_7']	問曰：	問曰：	013	A question is asked:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c06_1']	初禪中喜、二禪中喜有何差別？	初禪中喜、二禪中喜有何差別？	013	What is the difference between the joy in the first dhyāna and the joy in the second dhyāna?
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c06_4']	答曰：	答曰：	013	The answer is given:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c06_19']	初禪以滅憂故喜，二禪滅苦故喜。	初禪以滅憂故喜，二禪滅苦故喜。	013	In the first dhyāna, because sorrow is eliminated, there is joy. In the second dhyāna, because suffering is eliminated, there is joy.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c09_2']	又初禪中喜違不淨喜故得，二禪中喜違淨喜故得，雖俱以愛因緣故喜，而初禪喜弱。	又初禪中喜違不淨喜故得，二禪中喜違淨喜故得，雖俱以愛因緣故喜，而初禪喜弱。	013	Moreover, in the first dhyāna, joy is contrary to impure joy, so it is obtained. In the second dhyāna, joy is contrary to pure joy, so it is obtained. Although both are due to the causes of craving, the joy of the first dhyāna is weak.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c09_5']	問曰：	問曰：	013	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c09_16']	如是義為有漏、為無漏？	如是義為有漏、為無漏？	013	Is this principle contaminated or uncontaminated?

['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c11_7']	有我心則有喜，若無漏心則無我，無我故無喜。	有我心則有喜，若無漏心則無我，無我故無喜。	013	Where there is a self-mind, there is joy. If the mind is uncontaminated, there is no self. Because there is no self, there is no joy.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c11_10']	問曰：	問曰：	013	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c12_1']	無漏無喜，是事不然。	無漏無喜，是事不然。	013	It is not so that the uncontaminated has no joy.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c13_5']	佛七覺中說喜覺分，覺分但是無漏，故知有無漏喜。	佛七覺中說喜覺分，覺分但是無漏，故知有無漏喜。	013	In the Buddha's seven factors of enlightenment, he speaks of the factor of joy. The factors of enlightenment are only uncontaminated, so we know that there is uncontaminated joy.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c13_10']	又經中說：	又經中說：	013	Moreover, a sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c14_5']	心喜者得身猗，身猗則受樂。	心喜者得身猗，身猗則受樂。	013	One who is joyful attains physical tranquility. When the body is tranquil, one experiences bliss.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c15_1']	若無無漏喜，亦應無無漏猗樂。	若無無漏喜，亦應無無漏猗樂。	013	If there is no uncontaminated joy, there should also be no uncontaminated tranquility and bliss.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c16_4']	又佛見眾僧深行善法則生歡喜，故知有無漏喜。	又佛見眾僧深行善法則生歡喜，故知有無漏喜。	013	Moreover, when the Buddha sees the Sangha deeply practicing goodness, he gives rise to joy. Therefore we know that there is uncontaminated joy.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c16_7']	答曰：	答曰：	013	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c17_14']	汝以七覺證無漏喜，是事不然，覺分二種，有漏、無漏。	汝以七覺證無漏喜，是事不然，覺分二種，有漏、無漏。	013	Your argument that the seven factors of enlightenment prove there is undefiled joy is not correct, because the factors of enlightenment are of two kinds, defiled and undefiled.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c17_19']	如經中說：	如經中說：	013	As it is said in the sutras:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c18_13']	行者聽法時能斷五蓋、修七覺分。	行者聽法時能斷五蓋、修七覺分。	013	When practitioners listen to the Dharma, they can eliminate the five hindrances and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c19_16']	又覺名無學智，若為覺行不淨等法，皆名覺分。	又覺名無學智，若為覺行不淨等法，皆名覺分。	013	Moreover, enlightenment is called the knowledge of the adept. If one practices for enlightenment, the factors of impurity, etc., are all called factors of enlightenment.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c21_7']	汝說亦不應有無漏猗者，先生喜已後得無漏，謂如實知見。	汝說亦不應有無漏猗者，先生喜已後得無漏，謂如實知見。	013	Your argument that there should be no undefiled equanimity is also incorrect. First, joy arises, and later one attains the undefiled, which is called true knowledge and insight.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c22_9']	又非一切猗皆因喜生，如三禪已上無喜亦有猗。	又非一切猗皆因喜生，如三禪已上無喜亦有猗。	013	Moreover, not all equanimity arises from joy. In the third dhyana and above, there is no joy but there is equanimity.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c23_17']	又我等不說離智別有受法，此無漏智初來在心說名為樂。	又我等不說離智別有受法，此無漏智初來在心說名為樂。	013	Moreover, we do not say that apart from knowledge there is a separate dharma called feeling. This undefiled knowledge first comes to the mind and is called joy.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c24_12']	是故有無漏樂，但不因喜生。	是故有無漏樂，但不因喜生。	013	Therefore, there is undefiled joy, but it does not arise from joy.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c24_17']	又經中說：	又經中說：	013	Moreover, the sutras say:
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c25_15']	除身心麁重名猗，得無漏時身心調適。	除身心麁重名猗，得無漏時身心調適。	013	Eliminating the coarseness of body and mind is called equanimity. When one attains the undefiled, body and mind are at ease.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c26_4']	是故有無漏猗。	是故有無漏猗。	013	Therefore, there is undefiled equanimity.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c27_4']	又佛常行捨心，是故言佛有喜，此事應明。	又佛常行捨心，是故言佛有喜，此事應明。	013	Moreover, the Buddha always practices the mind of equanimity, therefore it is said that the Buddha has joy, this matter should be clarified.
['ZH_T32_1646_013:0341c28_16']	又若人無我我所則無喜，若羅漢有喜亦應有憂，而實無憂故知無喜。	又若人無我我所則無喜，若羅漢有喜亦應有憂，而實無憂故知無喜。	013	Moreover, if a person has no self and no possession, then there is no joy. If an arhat has joy, he should also have sorrow, but in reality he has no sorrow, therefore it is known that he has no joy.
