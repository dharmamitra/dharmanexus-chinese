['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522b25_11']	為簡於此故說彼行非無明發。	為簡於此故說彼行非無明發。	08b	in order to distinguish this, it is said that those actions are not produced by ignorance.
['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522b26_5']	非彼無明種子不發行也。	非彼無明種子不發行也。	08b	It is not that the seeds of ignorance do not give rise to activity.
['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522b26_10']	得成總報。	得成總報。	08b	One attains the general retribution.

['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522b29_1']	無有福．不動非無明所發。	無有福．不動非無明所發。	08b	Therefore there is no merit or immovable [karma] that is not given rise to by ignorance.
['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522c01_3']	不爾何故即彼經言我說諸聖有學不造新業。	不爾何故即彼經言我說諸聖有學不造新業。	08b	If it were not so, why would that same sutra say that I say that the noble ones with learning do not create new karma?
['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522c01_14']	不言內法異生不造新業。	不言內法異生不造新業。	08b	It does not say that ordinary beings of the internal teachings do not create new karma.

['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522c03_12']	是無明．行支。	是無明．行支。	08b	This is the link of ignorance and the link of karmic activity.
['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522c04_3']	彼二位中生得善法故。	彼二位中生得善法故。	08b	Because in those two stages there are wholesome dharmas obtained through birth,🔽this is the link of karmic activity that gives rise to general retribution.
['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522c05_6']	是行支感總報也　或說彼二方便善法不感總報。	是行支感總報也　或說彼二方便善法不感總報。	08b	Or it is said that the wholesome dharmas of skillful means in those two stages do not give rise to general retribution.
['ZH_T43_1830_08b:0522c06_1']	此中所說感總報業方成行。	此中所說感總報業方成行。	08b	The karmic activity that gives rise to general retribution explained here is only considered to be the link of karmic activity.
