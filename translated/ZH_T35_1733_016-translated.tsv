['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c07_15']	初釋名，佛者標人表德，小相者形大辨體，光明者依體起用，功德者用所成益。	初釋名，佛者標人表德，小相者形大辨體，光明者依體起用，功德者用所成益。	016	First, in explaining the name, Buddha indicates the person and represents the virtues, minor marks distinguish the form and define the essence, radiance means the arising of function based on the essence, and merits and virtues refer to the benefits accomplished by the function.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c08_8']	此則依人顯德，體用為名。	此則依人顯德，體用為名。	016	This is a name based on the person to show the virtues, with essence and function as the name.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c10_10']	二來意者，前品大相各有光明皆照法界，而未顯所照利益之相，故今此品正明益事。	二來意者，前品大相各有光明皆照法界，而未顯所照利益之相，故今此品正明益事。	016	Second, as for the reason for the chapter, in the previous chapter, each of the major marks has radiance that illuminates the Dharma realm, but the aspects of the benefits of what is illuminated have not yet been shown, so this chapter clarifies the beneficial matters.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c13_1']	為大相難明故辨小相，小相復多但論一相，一相有多時之益且說一時，此一時益復難明，故佛自說也。	為大相難明故辨小相，小相復多但論一相，一相有多時之益且說一時，此一時益復難明，故佛自說也。	016	Because the major marks are difficult to understand, the minor marks are explained, and among the many minor marks, only one mark is discussed. That one mark has benefits over time, but for now, only one time is mentioned. The benefits of that one time are also difficult to understand, so the Buddha himself explains it.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c14_2']	以此而論，前大相業用無邊無邊，極難知耳。	以此而論，前大相業用無邊無邊，極難知耳。	016	Based on this, the previous major marks have boundless, boundless karmic functions, which are extremely difficult to know.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c14_17']	又依前大相流出形好，故次來也。	又依前大相流出形好，故次來也。	016	Moreover, based on the previous major marks, the minor marks flow out, so they come next.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c15_13']	三宗趣者，宗明如來相德利用。	三宗趣者，宗明如來相德利用。	016	Third, the purport and purpose: the purport clarifies the characteristics, virtues, and functions of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c15_18']	略作二門：	略作二門：	016	Briefly making two aspects:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c18_2']	一定分齊者，既三十二相有八十隨好以嚴，則知十蓮花藏微塵數相一一各有塵數等好。	一定分齊者，既三十二相有八十隨好以嚴，則知十蓮花藏微塵數相一一各有塵數等好。	016	First, determining the scope: since the thirty-two major marks are adorned with eighty minor marks, it is known that the marks in the dust particles of the ten lotus flower treasuries each have as many minor marks as there are dust particles.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c19_17']	又此大相既一一深廣，與三十二中諸相不同，則知隨好亦甚深廣大不可量也。	又此大相既一一深廣，與三十二中諸相不同，則知隨好亦甚深廣大不可量也。	016	Moreover, since these major marks are each profound and vast, they are different from the various marks among the thirty-two, so it is known that the minor marks are also extremely profound, vast, and immeasurable.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c21_1']	二辨業用者，如八十隨好但嚴形佛生淨信。	二辨業用者，如八十隨好但嚴形佛生淨信。	016	Second, discerning the functions: like the eighty minor marks, they only adorn the Buddha's form and give rise to pure faith.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c23_16']	今此明小相，佛為菩薩時相輪隨好最下位處用，謂放一光照十世界塵數剎，地獄眾生皆得生天，成就十地十眼耳等。	今此明小相，佛為菩薩時相輪隨好最下位處用，謂放一光照十世界塵數剎，地獄眾生皆得生天，成就十地十眼耳等。	016	Now this clarifies the minor marks. When the Buddha was a bodhisattva, the function of the lowest position of the wheel of marks was to emit a light that illuminated the dust particles of worlds, and the sentient beings in hell all attained rebirth in the heavens and accomplished the ten grounds, the ten eyes, ears, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c25_2']	即此天子毛孔香普熏眾生，亦得十地白淨輪王。	即此天子毛孔香普熏眾生，亦得十地白淨輪王。	016	The fragrance from the pores of this celestial son pervades all beings, and they also attain the ten grounds and the white pure wheel-turning king.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c26_4']	又此輪王放光，復令無量眾生復得十地十眼等。	又此輪王放光，復令無量眾生復得十地十眼等。	016	Moreover, this wheel-turning king emits light and causes immeasurable beings to further attain the ten grounds and the ten eyes, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c27_4']	如是展轉盡於未來，傍無邊際，皆不可說。	如是展轉盡於未來，傍無邊際，皆不可說。	016	In this way, it continues on and on until the end of the future, with no limit in the side directions, all of which cannot be described.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c28_11']	菩薩小相既爾，如來大相之海利用自在，不可說不可說也。	菩薩小相既爾，如來大相之海利用自在，不可說不可說也。	016	The minor marks of the bodhisattvas are like this. The ocean of the great marks of the Tathāgata's function and mastery cannot be described or spoken of.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c28_17']	四釋文中二：	四釋文中二：	016	4. Explaining the text has two parts:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c29_4']	先略、後廣。	先略、後廣。	016	First, brief; later, extensive.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0400c29_9']	前中亦二：	前中亦二：	016	In the former, there are also two:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a01_8']	先明果用攝益、後「又菩薩」下明因用攝益。	先明果用攝益、後「又菩薩」下明因用攝益。	016	First, clarifying the benefit of the fruition function; later, below Moreover, the bodhisattva, clarifying the benefit of the causal function.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a01_18']	前中，何故佛自說者？	前中，何故佛自說者？	016	In the former, why did the Buddha himself speak?
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a02_2']	古人釋云：	古人釋云：	016	Ancient people explain:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a03_4']	前〈僧祇品〉明因究竟，此品明果究竟，故但佛說。	前〈僧祇品〉明因究竟，此品明果究竟，故但佛說。	016	The previous Chapter on the Eon clarifies the ultimate of the cause, this chapter clarifies the ultimate of the fruition, therefore only the Buddha speaks.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a03_7']	又釋：	又釋：	016	Moreover, it is explained:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a04_8']	明相極至小、用極廣大，此事難明，故佛自說。	明相極至小、用極廣大，此事難明，故佛自說。	016	The extreme of the marks is small, the extreme of the function is vast, this matter is difficult to clarify, therefore the Buddha himself speaks.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a04_18']	告寶手者，能採取故。	告寶手者，能採取故。	016	Addressing Ratnamudrāhasta is because he is able to gather and take.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a07_2']	海王隨形好者，是足下相輪處大相邊隨好之小相也，以餘大相業用難明，故說最下相輪之用。	海王隨形好者，是足下相輪處大相邊隨好之小相也，以餘大相業用難明，故說最下相輪之用。	016	The king of the ocean's minor marks that accord with the major marks are the minor marks that are the minor marks of the major marks on the wheel-marked soles of the feet. Because the function of the major marks is difficult to clarify, he speaks of the function of the wheel-marked soles of the feet, which are the major marks.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a08_9']	又以相輪大相猶難明故說隨好，隨好猶多故說海王一好。	又以相輪大相猶難明故說隨好，隨好猶多故說海王一好。	016	Moreover, because the major marks are still difficult to clarify, he speaks of the minor marks. Because there are still many minor marks, he speaks of the one minor mark of the king of the ocean.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a09_12']	此是果用猶亦難明，故說在兜率為菩薩時之攝益。	此是果用猶亦難明，故說在兜率為菩薩時之攝益。	016	This is the effect and function, which is still difficult to clarify, so he speaks of the benefit of gathering in Tuṣita when he was a bodhisattva.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a10_2']	就此因用二：	就此因用二：	016	There are two in this causal function:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a11_14']	初令離苦生天成安樂行、二「生天上已」以下令不著天樂成饒益行。	初令離苦生天成安樂行、二「生天上已」以下令不著天樂成饒益行。	016	First, causing them to leave suffering and be born in the heavens, accomplishing the practice of peace and happiness. Second, Having been born in the heavens, he causes them not to be attached to heavenly bliss, accomplishing the practice of benefiting others.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a12_9']	亦是前身光益、後是空聲益。	亦是前身光益、後是空聲益。	016	This is also the benefit of the body's light before, and the benefit of the empty voice afterwards.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a14_13']	前中，令淨十眼等者，以彼眾生宿有見聞普賢法種，復遇舍那法界光觸，故得十眼普賢之益。	前中，令淨十眼等者，以彼眾生宿有見聞普賢法種，復遇舍那法界光觸，故得十眼普賢之益。	016	In the former, causing them to purify the ten eyes and so forth is because those beings have previously seen and heard the Dharma of Samantabhadra, and again encounter the light of the Dharma realm of Vairocana, so they attain the benefit of the ten eyes and Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a15_14']	二天上益中，初示聲名不可樂者，不令著樂故。	二天上益中，初示聲名不可樂者，不令著樂故。	016	In the second, the benefits in the heavens, first it shows that the sounds and names are not enjoyable, not allowing attachment to pleasure.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a18_6']	四今佛加持，由此生天。	四今佛加持，由此生天。	016	Fourth, now being empowered by the Buddha, one is born in the heavens due to this.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a18_16']	示此因果，不應放逸。	示此因果，不應放逸。	016	Showing this cause and effect, one should not be negligent.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a22_13']	於彼者，於彼大相處，有此海王隨好小相。	於彼者，於彼大相處，有此海王隨好小相。	016	In that place, in that place of the major marks, there is this ocean king, a minor mark following the major marks.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a23_11']	一名清淨者，簡去多光，今但說一。	一名清淨者，簡去多光，今但說一。	016	The first is called pure, distinguishing and removing many lights, now only explaining one.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a24_18']	「普照」下明照益中，隨眾生境界者，所住差別，亦是所觀不同。	「普照」下明照益中，隨眾生境界者，所住差別，亦是所觀不同。	016	Universal Illumination below clarifies the benefits of illumination. According to the realms of sentient beings refers to the differences in their abodes, which are also the different objects of observation.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a25_12']	隨善根者，隨其宿種何乘善根。	隨善根者，隨其宿種何乘善根。	016	According to their wholesome roots refers to the wholesome roots of the vehicles they have planted in the past.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a26_14']	隨意者，意樂差別，亦是欲願不同，皆稱根成益。	隨意者，意樂差別，亦是欲願不同，皆稱根成益。	016	According to their intentions refers to the differences in their aspirations, which are also the different desires and vows, all of which accord with their capacities and bring benefits.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401a27_7']	越於餘益，故云乃至阿毘等。	越於餘益，故云乃至阿毘等。	016	Surpassing the other benefits, it says up to the Avīci hells, etc.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401b12_9']	復疑云：	復疑云：	016	There is another doubt:

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401b17_5']	勝報劣報可俱無體，佛果大用豈不有耶？	勝報劣報可俱無體，佛果大用豈不有耶？	016	Superior and inferior retribution may both be without substance, but the great function of the Buddha's fruition cannot be nonexistent, can it?

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401b18_17']	復疑云：	復疑云：	016	He further doubts and says:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401b19_8']	若爾，何故現有所益天報？	若爾，何故現有所益天報？	016	If so, why is there currently a heavenly reward that benefits?

Because this heavenly voice accords with the nature, is always non-existent, and the sentient beings who are benefited are also like this, therefore there is no fatigue.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0401b26_9']	於不可化眾生不生厭惡，於難受化眾生不生疲倦，於易心化眾生不生放逸，於已化竟眾生不生憍慢。	於不可化眾生不生厭惡，於難受化眾生不生疲倦，於易心化眾生不生放逸，於已化竟眾生不生憍慢。	016	One does not give rise to aversion towards unteachable sentient beings, does not give rise to fatigue towards difficult-to-accept sentient beings, does not give rise to negligence towards easily-minded sentient beings, and does not give rise to arrogance towards already-tamed sentient beings.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a21_9']	一分相門、二依持門、三融攝門、四性德門、五定義門、六染淨、七因果、八通局、九分齊、十建立。	一分相門、二依持門、三融攝門、四性德門、五定義門、六染淨、七因果、八通局、九分齊、十建立。	016	First, the aspect of division; second, the gate of reliance; third, the gate of fusion and inclusion; fourth, the gate of inherent virtues; fifth, the gate of definition; sixth, defilement and purity; seventh, cause and effect; eighth, scope and restriction; ninth, scope and extent; tenth, establishment.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a22_6']	初分相者，性有三種，謂理、行、果。	初分相者，性有三種，謂理、行、果。	016	First, the aspect of division: there are three kinds of nature, namely principle, practice, and fruition.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a23_2']	起亦有三，謂理性得、了因顯、現名起。	起亦有三，謂理性得、了因顯、現名起。	016	Arising also has three aspects: the nature of principle, the manifestation of the cause of understanding, and the name arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a23_17']	二行性，由待聞熏資發生果名起。	二行性，由待聞熏資發生果名起。	016	Second, the nature of practice, which is called arising because it depends on the development of the perfuming of hearing.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a25_12']	三果性起者，謂此果性更無別體，即彼理行兼具修生，至果位時合為果性。	三果性起者，謂此果性更無別體，即彼理行兼具修生，至果位時合為果性。	016	Third, the arising of the nature of fruition, which means that this nature of fruition has no separate substance, but is precisely that principle and practice combined, cultivated and produced, reaching the stage of fruition, combined to form the nature of fruition.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a26_3']	應機化用名之為起。	應機化用名之為起。	016	The function of transforming according to the capacities of beings is called arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a26_17']	是故三位各性各起，故云性起。	是故三位各性各起，故云性起。	016	Therefore, the three stages each have their own nature and their own arising, so it is called the nature of arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a27_13']	今此文中，正辨後一兼辨前二也。	今此文中，正辨後一兼辨前二也。	016	In this text, it correctly explains the latter one and also explains the former two.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405a29_14']	二依持門者，一行證理成，即以理為性、行成為起，此約菩薩位，以凡位有性而無起故。	二依持門者，一行證理成，即以理為性、行成為起，此約菩薩位，以凡位有性而無起故。	016	Second, the gate of support means that the practice realizes the principle and takes the principle as the nature and the practice as the arising. This is about the stage of the bodhisattva, because the stage of ordinary beings has the nature but not the arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b01_19']	二證圓成果，即理行為性、果成為起，此約佛自德。	二證圓成果，即理行為性、果成為起，此約佛自德。	016	Second, the realization of the perfect fruition takes the principle and practice as the nature and the fruition as the arising. This is about the self-virtue of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b03_17']	三理行圓成之果為性、赴感應機之用為起，是即理行徹至果用，故起唯性起也。	三理行圓成之果為性、赴感應機之用為起，是即理行徹至果用，故起唯性起也。	016	Third, the fruition of perfect accomplishment of principle and practice is the nature, and the function of responding to and accommodating faculties is the arising. This is the penetration of principle and practice to the fruition function, therefore arising is only the arising of nature.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b04_17']	三融攝門者，既行依理起，即行虛性實。	三融攝門者，既行依理起，即行虛性實。	016	Third, the gate of merging and embracing. Since practice arises based on principle, practice is empty and principle is real.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b05_18']	虛盡實現，起唯性起，乃至果用唯是真性之用。	虛盡實現，起唯性起，乃至果用唯是真性之用。	016	When emptiness is exhausted and reality appears, arising is only the arising of nature, up to the fruition function being only the function of true reality.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b08_2']	四性德門者，以理性即行性，是故起唯理性起。	四性德門者，以理性即行性，是故起唯理性起。	016	Fourth, the gate of inherent qualities. Because the nature of principle is the nature of practice, therefore arising is only the arising of the nature of principle.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b11_10']	理是無為、行是有為，理顯為法身、行滿為報身，法報不同為無為異，云何理性即行耶？	理是無為、行是有為，理顯為法身、行滿為報身，法報不同為無為異，云何理性即行耶？	016	Principle is unconditioned, and practice is conditioned. Principle manifests as the Dharma body, and practice is fulfilled as the reward body. The Dharma and reward bodies are different, and the unconditioned and conditioned are different. How can the nature of principle be practice?

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b12_7']	以如來藏中具足恒沙性功德故。	以如來藏中具足恒沙性功德故。	016	Because the Tathāgatagarbha is replete with the merits of the nature of the innumerable sands of the Ganges.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b16_21']	《如來藏經》模中像等，及《寶性論》真如為種性等，皆是此義。	《如來藏經》模中像等，及《寶性論》真如為種性等，皆是此義。	016	The Tathagatagarbha Sutra speaks of the image in the mold, and so forth, and the Ratnagotravibhaga speaks of true suchness as the seed nature, and so forth, all of which are of this meaning.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b18_4']	是故藉修引至成位名為果性，果性赴感名為性起。	是故藉修引至成位名為果性，果性赴感名為性起。	016	Therefore, relying on cultivation to reach the stage of accomplishment is called the nature of fruition. The nature of fruition responding to conditions is called the arising of the nature.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b18_12']	五定義門者，問：	五定義門者，問：	016	The fifth is the gate of definitive meaning. The question is:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b20_1']	下文云「非少因緣成等正覺」，此乃是緣起，何故唯言性起耶？	下文云「非少因緣成等正覺」，此乃是緣起，何故唯言性起耶？	016	The text below says, Not by few causes and conditions is perfect supreme enlightenment attained, which is precisely dependent arising. Why is it said to be only the arising of the nature?
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b20_4']	釋云：	釋云：	016	The explanation says:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b20_8']	有四義。	有四義。	016	There are four meanings.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b22_13']	一以果海自體當不可說不可說性，機感具緣約緣明起，起已違緣而順自性，是故廢緣但名性起。	一以果海自體當不可說不可說性，機感具緣約緣明起，起已違緣而順自性，是故廢緣但名性起。	016	First, the essence of the fruition sea itself is of the nature of the unspeakable and unspeakable, and the conditions of the complete response of the capacity are based on conditions to clarify arising. Having arisen, it goes against conditions and accords with its own nature. Therefore, it is abandoned and only called nature arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b23_8']	二性體不可說，若說即名起。	二性體不可說，若說即名起。	016	Second, the nature essence is unspeakable. If spoken of, it is called arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b24_14']	今就緣說起，起無餘起，還以性為起，故名性起不名緣起。	今就緣說起，起無餘起，還以性為起，故名性起不名緣起。	016	Now, based on conditions, it is said to arise. Arising without other arising, it still takes nature as arising, therefore it is called nature arising and not conditioned arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b27_1']	三起雖攬緣，緣必無性，無性之理顯於緣處，是故就顯但名性起，如「從無住本立一切法」等。	三起雖攬緣，緣必無性，無性之理顯於緣處，是故就顯但名性起，如「從無住本立一切法」等。	016	Third, although arising embraces conditions, conditions must be without nature. The principle of no nature is manifested in the place of conditions. Therefore, based on the manifestation, it is only called nature arising, like establishing all dharmas based on the root of non-abiding.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b27_17']	四若此所起，似彼緣相，即屬緣起。	四若此所起，似彼緣相，即屬緣起。	016	Fourth, if what is arisen resembles the characteristics of those conditions, it belongs to conditioned arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405b28_16']	今明所起唯據淨用，順證真性，故屬性起。	今明所起唯據淨用，順證真性，故屬性起。	016	Now, what is clarified in the arising is only based on pure function, in accordance with the true nature of evidence, therefore it belongs to nature arising.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c01_14']	一切諸法皆依性立，何故下文性起之法，唯約淨法不取染耶？	一切諸法皆依性立，何故下文性起之法，唯約淨法不取染耶？	016	All dharmas are established based on nature. Why does the text below only discuss the dharmas that arise from nature in terms of pure dharmas and not take defiled ones?
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c01_16']	答：	答：	016	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c03_3']	染淨等法雖同依真，但違順異故，染屬無明、淨歸性起。	染淨等法雖同依真，但違順異故，染屬無明、淨歸性起。	016	Although defiled and pure dharmas are the same in relying on suchness, they differ in being contrary or in accord. Therefore, defilement belongs to ignorance, and purity returns to arising from nature.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c03_5']	問：	問：	016	Question:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c03_15']	染非性起，應離於真。	染非性起，應離於真。	016	If defilement is not arising from nature, it should be apart from suchness.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c04_15']	以違真故不得離真，以違真故不屬真用。	以違真故不得離真，以違真故不屬真用。	016	Because it is contrary to suchness, it cannot be apart from suchness. Because it is contrary to suchness, it does not belong to the function of suchness.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c05_17']	如人顛倒帶靴為帽，倒即是靴，故不離靴。	如人顛倒帶靴為帽，倒即是靴，故不離靴。	016	It is like a person who mistakenly wears boots as a hat. The mistake is still boots, so it is not apart from boots.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c06_8']	首帶為帽，非靴所用。	首帶為帽，非靴所用。	016	Wearing boots as a hat is not the use of boots.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c07_15']	當知此中道理亦爾，以染不離真體，故說眾生即如等也；	當知此中道理亦爾，以染不離真體，故說眾生即如等也；	016	You should know that the principle here is also like this. Because defilement is not apart from the essence of suchness, it is said that sentient beings are suchness, etc.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c08_10']	以不順真用，故非此性起攝。	以不順真用，故非此性起攝。	016	Because it is not in accord with the function of suchness, it is not included in this arising from nature.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c09_7']	若約留惑有淨用，亦入性起收。	若約留惑有淨用，亦入性起收。	016	If, in terms of remaining in delusion, there is the function of purity, it is also included in arising from nature.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c11_10']	是所救故、所斷故、所知故，是故一切無非性起。	是所救故、所斷故、所知故，是故一切無非性起。	016	Because they are what is saved, what is cut off, and what is known, therefore all are not apart from nature origination.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c13_1']	答：	答：	016	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c13_9']	以未圓故不辨耳。	以未圓故不辨耳。	016	Because it is not yet perfect, it is not discussed.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c16_16']	若從此義，初發菩提心已去皆性起攝，唯除凡小，以二處不生牙故。	若從此義，初發菩提心已去皆性起攝，唯除凡小，以二處不生牙故。	016	If it is based on this meaning, from the initial arousal of the bodhi mind onward, all are included in nature origination, except for ordinary beings and the two vehicles, because they do not sprout in those two places.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c17_18']	若據為緣令彼生善，亦性起攝，如日照生盲等。	若據為緣令彼生善，亦性起攝，如日照生盲等。	016	If it is about being the condition that causes them to give rise to wholesome states, it is also included in nature origination, like the sun shining on the blind and so on.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c20_3']	此性起唯據佛果，何故下文菩薩自知身中有性起菩提，一切眾生心中亦爾。	此性起唯據佛果，何故下文菩薩自知身中有性起菩提，一切眾生心中亦爾。	016	This nature-arising is only based on the fruition of Buddhahood. Why is it that in the text below, the bodhisattva himself knows that within his body there is the nature-arising bodhi, and it is the same in the minds of all sentient beings?
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c20_5']	答：	答：	016	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c21_3']	若三乘教，眾生心中但有因性、無果用相。	若三乘教，眾生心中但有因性、無果用相。	016	If it is the teaching of the Three Vehicles, then in the minds of sentient beings there is only the causal nature and not the characteristics of the fruition function.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c22_9']	此圓教中，盧舍那果法該眾生界，是故眾生身中亦有果相。	此圓教中，盧舍那果法該眾生界，是故眾生身中亦有果相。	016	In this Perfect Teaching, the fruition dharmas of Vairocana pervade the realm of sentient beings. Therefore, the fruition characteristics are also present within the bodies of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c23_9']	若不爾者，則但是性而無起義，非此品說。	若不爾者，則但是性而無起義，非此品說。	016	If it were not so, then it would only be the nature and not the meaning of arising, which is not what this chapter discusses.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c25_4']	文意不爾，以明性起唯果法故，但以果中具三世間，是故眾生亦此所攝。	文意不爾，以明性起唯果法故，但以果中具三世間，是故眾生亦此所攝。	016	The meaning of the text is not so. It clarifies that nature-arising is only the fruition dharmas. It is only because the fruition is endowed with the three worlds that sentient beings are also included here.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c26_1']	既局佛果，何故下文通一切法？	既局佛果，何故下文通一切法？	016	Since it is limited to the fruition of Buddhahood, why does the text below include all dharmas?
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c26_3']	答：	答：	016	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c27_22']	若三乘教，真如之性通情非情，開覺佛性唯局有情，故《涅槃》云「非佛性者，謂草木等。	若三乘教，真如之性通情非情，開覺佛性唯局有情，故《涅槃》云「非佛性者，謂草木等。	016	If it is the teaching of the Three Vehicles, then the nature of suchness pervades both animate and inanimate beings. The opening of the Buddha-nature is only limited to sentient beings. Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, That which is not the Buddha-nature refers to grasses, trees, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0405c28_19']	」若圓教中，佛性及性起皆通依正，如下文辨。	」若圓教中，佛性及性起皆通依正，如下文辨。	016	If in the perfect teaching, buddha-nature and nature-arising both pervade the correct and the provisional, as will be explained below.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0406a01_10']	是故成佛具三世間，國土身等皆是佛身，是故局唯佛果，通遍非情。	是故成佛具三世間，國土身等皆是佛身，是故局唯佛果，通遍非情。	016	Therefore, in becoming a buddha, one is endowed with the three worlds. The lands, bodies, etc. are all the buddha-body. Therefore, it is limited to only the fruition of buddhahood, and pervades non-sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0406a02_15']	九分齊門者，既此真性融遍一切故，彼所起亦具一切。	九分齊門者，既此真性融遍一切故，彼所起亦具一切。	016	The ninth gate of scope: Since this true nature pervades everything, that which arises from it is also endowed with everything.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0406a05_7']	分圓無際，是故分處皆悉圓滿，無不皆具無盡法界，是故遍一切時、一切處、一切法等，如因陀羅網無不具足。	分圓無際，是故分處皆悉圓滿，無不皆具無盡法界，是故遍一切時、一切處、一切法等，如因陀羅網無不具足。	016	The limited and the perfect are without boundaries. Therefore, in limited places, they are all completely perfect, and all are endowed with the inexhaustible Dharma realm.

The nine kinds such as bodily actions are the specific characteristics. They are all the nature of arising. Same, different, formation, and destruction can all be understood by analogy.

The concluding text of the ten below also concludes each of the ten extensive explanations. Therefore, there are four types of causes and conditions in this section:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a01_14']	一云十種者，據初略也。	一云十種者，據初略也。	016	First, it is said that there are ten, based on the initial brief explanation.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a03_19']	三云千者，就後十結，一一結百，故有千門。	三云千者，就後十結，一一結百，故有千門。	016	Third, it is said that there are one thousand, based on the concluding of the ten below, each concluding one hundred, thus there are one thousand aspects.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a06_10']	四無量阿僧祇等者，彼廣等中，一一各有多門，如四智風輪十光明等，又亦通攝身等九中諸因緣，故無量等也。	四無量阿僧祇等者，彼廣等中，一一各有多門，如四智風輪十光明等，又亦通攝身等九中諸因緣，故無量等也。	016	As for the four immeasurables, incalculable, etc., in the extensive explanations, each has many approaches, such as the four wisdoms, wind wheels, ten lights, etc. It also comprehensively includes the various causes and conditions among the nine dharmas such as the body, therefore it is immeasurable, etc.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a11_4']	二甚深微妙名為不思，故下云「無有作者亦無成者」等。	二甚深微妙名為不思，故下云「無有作者亦無成者」等。	016	Second, the extremely profound and subtle is called inconceivable, therefore the text below says there is no creator and also no accomplisher, etc.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a11_19']	此二並非下位測量，故云不思也。	此二並非下位測量，故云不思也。	016	These two are both not measurable by those of lower levels, therefore it is said to be inconceivable.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a14_7']	釋中，初一是行本，由此大心長劫熏習不捨眾生，是故於今現成正覺；	釋中，初一是行本，由此大心長劫熏習不捨眾生，是故於今現成正覺；	016	In the explanation, the first is the basis of practice. Because of this great mind, one cultivates for long eons and does not abandon sentient beings. Therefore, in the present, one manifests perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a15_8']	二久修眾善，正直深心引此善根現成正覺；	二久修眾善，正直深心引此善根現成正覺；	016	Second, one cultivates many wholesome dharmas for a long time, and the sincere and profound mind draws these wholesome roots to manifest perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a16_7']	三以慈悲救生，無限盡故，現成正覺；	三以慈悲救生，無限盡故，現成正覺；	016	Third, because one saves beings with compassion and mercy without limit, one manifests perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a17_8']	四積行廣多大願無竭，盡於未來，現成正覺；	四積行廣多大願無竭，盡於未來，現成正覺；	016	Fourth, one's practice accumulates widely, and great vows are inexhaustible, extending to the future, manifesting perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a19_3']	五雖積德成滿，而度生增善情無厭足，故現正覺，如與盲比丘貫針等；	五雖積德成滿，而度生增善情無厭足，故現正覺，如與盲比丘貫針等；	016	Fifth, although one's accumulated virtues are complete, one's mind to deliver beings and increase goodness is never satisfied, and therefore one manifests perfect enlightenment, like piercing a needle for a blind monk, and so on.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a22_12']	十若不成佛，無由宣說無盡法義，故現正覺。	十若不成佛，無由宣說無盡法義，故現正覺。	016	Ninth, if one does not become a Buddha, there is no way to proclaim inexhaustible Dharma meanings, and therefore one manifests perfect enlightenment.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a24_3']	此十皆是果成之處說彼因緣，但是為生現佛之因，不取自德。	此十皆是果成之處說彼因緣，但是為生現佛之因，不取自德。	016	These ten are all places where the fruition is established, speaking of their causes and conditions. They are only the causes for giving rise to the present Buddha, not taking his own virtues.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a25_12']	又亦即以為生現佛為其自德，更無別自，是故攝因無不皆盡。	又亦即以為生現佛為其自德，更無別自，是故攝因無不皆盡。	016	Moreover, they are also used to give rise to the present Buddha as his own virtues, without any other self. Therefore, the causes are all completely included.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407a26_17']	如是因緣既無自性，無自性理為本起用，故名性起。	如是因緣既無自性，無自性理為本起用，故名性起。	016	Thus, since the causes and conditions are devoid of self-nature, the principle of no self-nature is the basis for giving rise to function, and is therefore called nature arising.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b02_2']	初是大千興造喻，喻佛眾緣共起性起德。	初是大千興造喻，喻佛眾緣共起性起德。	016	The first is the analogy of the creation of the great trichiliocosm, which compares the Buddha's nature-arising virtues arising together with many conditions.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b03_5']	於中喻內，初總舉多緣、二別辨雲雨、三因雨起風。	於中喻內，初總舉多緣、二別辨雲雨、三因雨起風。	016	Within the analogy, first it generally mentions many conditions, second it specifically explains the clouds and rain, and third it explains the winds arising from the rain.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b04_16']	一名能持者，眾生業力於空劫處，世界將成，於上空中先起雲雨。	一名能持者，眾生業力於空劫處，世界將成，於上空中先起雲雨。	016	First, it is called the supporter. Due to the power of sentient beings' karma, in the empty eon, when the world is about to form, clouds and rain first arise in the sky above.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b06_2']	若無風持，雨水無停，壞餘世界，是故業力起初風輪。	若無風持，雨水無停，壞餘世界，是故業力起初風輪。	016	If there is no wind to hold it, the rainwater has no place to stay, and it destroys the other worlds. Therefore, the power of karma gives rise to the first wind wheel.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b07_6']	水若不減，無由得起諸天宮殿，是故業力起次風輪。	水若不減，無由得起諸天宮殿，是故業力起次風輪。	016	If the water does not decrease, there is no way for the heavenly palaces to arise. Therefore, the power of karma gives rise to the next wind wheel.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b09_11']	雖能消水，處起無由，是故業力起第三風，減一節水起一天宮，如是漸下至成須彌山及大地等。	雖能消水，處起無由，是故業力起第三風，減一節水起一天宮，如是漸下至成須彌山及大地等。	016	Although it can evaporate the water, there is no way for it to arise in a place. Therefore, the power of karma gives rise to the third wind, reducing one section of water to give rise to a heavenly palace. In this way, it gradually descends to form Mount Sumeru and the great earth, etc.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b11_7']	雖起總處，不能辦彼別類莊嚴，故彼業力起第四風，令此世界方得圓滿。	雖起總處，不能辦彼別類莊嚴，故彼業力起第四風，令此世界方得圓滿。	016	Although it gives rise to the general place, it cannot accomplish the specific adornments. Therefore, the power of karma gives rise to the fourth wind, causing this world to finally be completed.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b12_12']	此器世間先成，眾生世間後成，廣如《俱舍論》辨耳。	此器世間先成，眾生世間後成，廣如《俱舍論》辨耳。	016	This vessel world is formed first, and the world of sentient beings is formed later. It is explained in detail in the Abhidharma-kośa-śāstra.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b13_18']	四結業因中，言菩薩善根者，同受用故、地前菩薩生穢土故。	四結業因中，言菩薩善根者，同受用故、地前菩薩生穢土故。	016	In the fourth, concluding the causes of karma, it says the bodhisattvas' wholesome roots because they share the same enjoyment, and because the bodhisattvas below the grounds are born in defiled lands.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b15_4']	五結多緣，此四為首，理實無量，故云如是等無量也。	五結多緣，此四為首，理實無量，故云如是等無量也。	016	Fifth, concluding the many conditions. These four are the main ones, but in reality there are innumerable others, thus it says such innumerable...

Water has no self-nature.🔽There is no creator, explaining that the essence of the creator is empty.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b17_7']	亦無成者，明所作性空。	亦無成者，明所作性空。	016	There is also no completion, explaining that the nature of the created is empty.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b19_18']	四中一總持細法智；	四中一總持細法智；	016	Among the four, the first is the subtle knowledge of dhāraṇī;
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b20_14']	次二依法起行智，一滅惑、二成德；	次二依法起行智，一滅惑、二成德；	016	The next two are the knowledge of practicing according to the Dharma, one extinguishing delusions and the other accomplishing virtues;

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b21_18']	釋：	釋：	016	The explanation:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b22_16']	以在果位說彼往因，故云曾於過去等也。	以在果位說彼往因，故云曾於過去等也。	016	Because it is said in the stage of fruition, it is said that in the past, etc.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b23_15']	果中但取攝化之果，故云令眾生等也。	果中但取攝化之果，故云令眾生等也。	016	In the fruition, only the fruition of subsuming and transforming is taken, so it is said to cause sentient beings, etc.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b26_11']	第二洪澍大千喻，此即是前風所持雨，以喻佛深廣難知德，謂得無盡陀羅尼力名成就諸力。	第二洪澍大千喻，此即是前風所持雨，以喻佛深廣難知德，謂得無盡陀羅尼力名成就諸力。	016	The second is the analogy of a great rain pouring on a great trichiliocosm. This is the rain held by the wind mentioned above, used as an analogy for the virtue of the Buddha's profundity and vastness that is difficult to know. It is said that attaining the power of inexhaustible dhāraṇīs is called accomplishing all powers.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b27_7']	若約一乘，十信已去菩薩是也；	若約一乘，十信已去菩薩是也；	016	If in terms of the One Vehicle, it refers to bodhisattvas from the stage of the ten faiths onward;

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b28_19', 'ZH_T35_1733_016:0407b29_13']	答：🔽以彼大水是眾生業感，令成世界。	答： 以彼大水是眾生業感，令成世界。	016	Answer:🔽Because that great water is what sentient beings experience through their karma, causing the formation of the world.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407c01_17']	彼大菩薩機所感故，如來興世說此法雨，故是因緣。	彼大菩薩機所感故，如來興世說此法雨，故是因緣。	016	Because it is what the great bodhisattvas' capacities cause to be experienced, the Tathāgata appears in the world and expounds this Dharma rain. Therefore, it is causes and conditions.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407c04_1']	第三大雨無從喻，此亦是前所說大雨眾生業力，從雲所澍本無停佇，後消滅時亦無去處。	第三大雨無從喻，此亦是前所說大雨眾生業力，從雲所澍本無停佇，後消滅時亦無去處。	016	The third great rain is without a simile, this is also the great rain mentioned above, the power of sentient beings' karma, which pours down from the clouds without any delay, and when it dissipates later, it also has no place to go.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407c05_14']	況性起賴緣無來去德，謂於佛無從、入機無去，由此佛興，故是因緣。	況性起賴緣無來去德，謂於佛無從、入機無去，由此佛興，故是因緣。	016	How much more so is the arising of nature dependent on conditions, without the virtue of coming and going, that is to say, in the Buddha there is no coming from, and in the beings there is no going to, because of this the Buddha appears, therefore it is dependent origination.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0407c08_11']	第四大雨難知喻，亦名摩醯知滴喻，此亦是前劫初大雨況佛性起，大機堪受德，謂已具修十地行力，是故器大方堪受此。	第四大雨難知喻，亦名摩醯知滴喻，此亦是前劫初大雨況佛性起，大機堪受德，謂已具修十地行力，是故器大方堪受此。	016	The fourth great rain is difficult to know, also called the simile of Maheśvara knowing the drops, this is also the great rain at the beginning of the eon mentioned above, which illustrates the arising of the Buddha-nature, the virtue of being able to accept the great capacity, that is to say, having already cultivated the power of the practices of the ten grounds, therefore the great vessel is able to accept this.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a02_19']	自然智者，不待功用故。	自然智者，不待功用故。	016	The spontaneous wisdom is because it does not depend on effort.

Why does the heading mention the five stages of causes such as arousing the mind, and the eight aspects of fruition such as becoming a buddha?
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a05_12']	答：	答：	016	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a07_1']	此是以法性融通門釋，謂事隨理以融通故，得相即相入故也。	此是以法性融通門釋，謂事隨理以融通故，得相即相入故也。	016	This is an explanation using the principle of the interpenetration of phenomena and principle. It means that phenomena follow principle and thus interpenetrate, so they can mutually include and enter each other.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a08_13']	又餘教中觀無生唯照理性，此圓教中具足一切佛菩薩法，依宗准之。	又餘教中觀無生唯照理性，此圓教中具足一切佛菩薩法，依宗准之。	016	Moreover, in other teachings, contemplating non-arising only illuminates the principle of reality. In this perfect teaching, it is replete with all the dharmas of buddhas and bodhisattvas. The principle should be understood based on the teachings.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a13_8']	初化現無形喻，喻菩提成不平等德。	初化現無形喻，喻菩提成不平等德。	016	The first is the analogy of manifesting transformations without form, which illustrates the attainment of enlightenment and the virtue of non-equality.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a14_5']	喻中，初化多心者，喻各各修多因也。	喻中，初化多心者，喻各各修多因也。	016	In the analogy, first, the transformation of many minds illustrates the cultivation of many causes individually.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a16_6']	合結可知。	合結可知。	016	The conclusion of the combination can be known.
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a17_4']	第八「佛子如來應供」下明依定起用門。	第八「佛子如來應供」下明依定起用門。	016	The eighth, below Buddha-Son, the Tathagata, the Worthy of Offerings, clarifies the gate of arising from concentration and performing functions.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a26_12']	先標中亦三，初一毛道者，謂於空中容一毛處名為毛道，即於此處見前門中眾生數等菩提之身無不圓滿；	先標中亦三，初一毛道者，謂於空中容一毛處名為毛道，即於此處見前門中眾生數等菩提之身無不圓滿；	016	First, the indication also has three. The first, the path of a single hair, means that within empty space, a place that can accommodate a single hair is called the path of a hair. Within this place, the enlightened bodies equal to the number of sentient beings seen in the previous gate are all perfectly complete;
['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414a27_8']	二類顯一切毛道，一一皆爾；	二類顯一切毛道，一一皆爾；	016	The second, the analogy reveals that all paths of hair are like this;

It is not that bodhisattvas have the nature of causes for bodhi, the Buddha. The text is correctly discerning the bodhi of the Buddha.

['ZH_T35_1733_016:0414b13_2']	眾生心中菩提之性，既與果法無有差別，則眾生身中有果德菩提，非唯因性。	眾生心中菩提之性，既與果法無有差別，則眾生身中有果德菩提，非唯因性。	016	The nature of bodhi in the minds of sentient beings, since it is no different from the dharma of fruition, then within the bodies of sentient beings there is the bodhi of fruition virtues, not only the nature of causes.

First, it presents the gate of one thusness to accord with parinirvāṇa, meaning that this parinirvāṇa with the head facing north at the twin śāla trees is the same as thusness, with a single flavor of equality, unborn and unceasing.
