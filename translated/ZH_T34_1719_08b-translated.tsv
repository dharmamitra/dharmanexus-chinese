The first text is the world, because the three grades are different. Up to now is the antidote, because it removes disgust. Silently thinking is for the sake of generating great goodness in people. The provisional and the real is the principle of the first truth, because it is not spoken or thought.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0302c28_2']	「上來何意」下但是釋疑，非四悉數。	「上來何意」下但是釋疑，非四悉數。	08b	What is the meaning of the above? It is only resolving doubts, not the number of the four siddhāntas.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a01_8']	「我等於佛」下述領不及，上中根聞譬，具領五時及法身地，中止方便見勝應身，如來猶斥領所不及；	「我等於佛」下述領不及，上中根聞譬，具領五時及法身地，中止方便見勝應身，如來猶斥領所不及；	08b	We, in the Buddha and below describe the inability to understand. In the middle and above, the disciples heard the parables, fully understood the five periods and the stage of the Dharma body, and in the middle, they saw the superior manifestation body, but the Tathāgata still criticized their inability to understand what was received;
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a03_12']	我今聞此雖欲領會，豈能逾於四大弟子，當知所領之外不及處多，是故亦云「所不能宣」。	我今聞此雖欲領會，豈能逾於四大弟子，當知所領之外不及處多，是故亦云「所不能宣」。	08b	Although I now hear this and wish to understand it, how could I surpass the four great disciples? One should know that there are many places outside of what is understood, and therefore it is also said that what cannot be proclaimed.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a05_6', 'ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a07_13']	然聞迦葉、身子具領，如來委述非全昧旨，但仰佛法高深，未敢逾於先悟耳。🔽「助宣我法」等者，若以本望迹，豈不曾於過去佛所或助單半單滿等，而必須滿中相帶及開等耶？	然聞迦葉、身子具領，如來委述非全昧旨，但仰佛法高深，未敢逾於先悟耳。 「助宣我法」等者，若以本望迹，豈不曾於過去佛所或助單半單滿等，而必須滿中相帶及開等耶？	08b	However, having heard that Kāśyapa and Śāriputra fully understood, the Tathāgata's detailed explanation is not completely oblivious to the meaning, but he looks up to the Buddha's Dharma as lofty and profound, and does not dare to surpass the prior understanding.🔽As for assisting in proclaiming my Dharma and so forth, if one looks at the traces from the basis, how could it not have been in the past Buddhas' places, either assisting in the single half, single fullness, and so forth, but must it be the fullness in the middle, with the characteristics of the open and so forth?
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a10_5']	對於今佛出五濁世，宜引開權廢會等化，是故皆從同類以說，如文殊引往光照東方，豈無餘途引同例耳。	對於今佛出五濁世，宜引開權廢會等化，是故皆從同類以說，如文殊引往光照東方，豈無餘途引同例耳。	08b	In comparison with the present Buddha's appearance in the world of the five turbidities, it is appropriate to draw on the opening of the provisional, the abolition of the assembly, and so forth, and therefore they are all spoken from the same kind. It is like Mañjuśrī drawing the past light illuminating the east, how could there not be other paths? It is just drawing on the same example.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a14_4']	「自捨」至「方便也」者，若據除佛之言，補處亦應不測，既其不測，本迹難量，何但曾於過去諸佛，亦可本與過去佛齊，就過去佛本復難量，或當亦是過去佛師，何但齊耶？	「自捨」至「方便也」者，若據除佛之言，補處亦應不測，既其不測，本迹難量，何但曾於過去諸佛，亦可本與過去佛齊，就過去佛本復難量，或當亦是過去佛師，何但齊耶？	08b	From 'abandoning' to 'skillful means' - if we go by the words 'except for the Buddha,' even the one who will succeed the Buddha should not be able to fathom. Since he cannot fathom it, the original and traces are difficult to measure. Not only was he once in the past with the Buddhas, he may also have originally been equal to the Buddhas of the past. Even with the Buddhas of the past, the original is still difficult to measure. He may also be the teacher of the Buddhas of the past. How can he only be equal?

['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a23_10']	又如諸文所列五時，純是善道者於中亦有差品不同，若無女人必無惡道，或時有女人亦無惡道，如阿閦佛國雖有女人而無女事，無量壽國二種俱無，不同之相不可具列，但以乘戒各有三品互相交絡，略可準知。	又如諸文所列五時，純是善道者於中亦有差品不同，若無女人必無惡道，或時有女人亦無惡道，如阿閦佛國雖有女人而無女事，無量壽國二種俱無，不同之相不可具列，但以乘戒各有三品互相交絡，略可準知。	08b	Moreover, as listed in various texts, those in the five periods of pure good paths also have different levels of distinction. If there are no women, there must be no evil paths, or sometimes there may be women but still no evil paths. For example, in the land of Akṣobhya Buddha, although there are women, there is no female desire. In the land of Amitāyus, both are completely absent. The differences cannot be listed in detail, but they can be roughly understood by comparing the three levels of vehicle and precepts.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a24_6']	「月藏第九法食」等者，法食，聞法也。	「月藏第九法食」等者，法食，聞法也。	08b	The ninth Dharma food of the Moon Treasury and so on, Dharma food refers to hearing the Dharma.

['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303a29_16']	《月藏》第五，十善各十功德，亦與《淨名》十善是菩薩淨土意同，故一一文末皆云後作佛等。	《月藏》第五，十善各十功德，亦與《淨名》十善是菩薩淨土意同，故一一文末皆云後作佛等。	08b	The fifth chapter of the Candragarbha Sūtra, on the ten virtues each having ten merits, is also the same as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra's view of the ten virtues being the pure land of the bodhisattva. Therefore, at the end of each text it says later becomes a buddha and so on.

Attracting beings to aspire towards them, the two meanings are different. The methods of manifesting traces cannot be taken as the same standard.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303b24_5']	「譬說有二」至「顯實」者，皆云領法譬者，故前開譬本中直作開權顯實，則應三周及信解五百領解文也，三節開文意在於此。	「譬說有二」至「顯實」者，皆云領法譬者，故前開譬本中直作開權顯實，則應三周及信解五百領解文也，三節開文意在於此。	08b	The parables have two parts up to revealing the truth all say that those who understand the parables and the Dharma, therefore, in the original opening of the parables, it is directly said to be opening the provisional and revealing the truth, then it should be the three chapters and the understanding of the five hundred disciples, the meaning of the three sections of the opening text is in this.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303b25_3']	言「譬如有人即二乘人」者，二乘機耳。	言「譬如有人即二乘人」者，二乘機耳。	08b	It is said it is like a person, namely a person of the two vehicles, the capacities of the two vehicles.

The first is like a young child attached to the five desires, only like the Dharma masters who always do not look down on others, or a single verse of karmic affinity. The next is weak goodness or the beginning of the five ranks who have not yet entered similarity, so it is called weak.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c03_5']	以由結緣厚薄不同，遂名無明以為輕重，故云「醉有二種」，當知貧人本來先醉，如蒙肴膳受已而臥，三教助道猶如肴膳，更以異方便助顯第一義也。	以由結緣厚薄不同，遂名無明以為輕重，故云「醉有二種」，當知貧人本來先醉，如蒙肴膳受已而臥，三教助道猶如肴膳，更以異方便助顯第一義也。	08b	Because the thickness of karmic affinity is different, it is called ignorance, which is considered light or heavy. Therefore, it is said that drunkenness has two kinds. You should know that the poor person was originally drunk first, like receiving a feast and lying down after receiving it. The three teachings of assisting the Way are like a feast, and using different skillful means to assist in revealing the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c06_8']	肴膳食已便消，如方便教非究竟益，往在大通佛所，未結大緣已前歷諸味中並聞三教，及至法華雖聞圓頓，但成結緣如繫珠也。	肴膳食已便消，如方便教非究竟益，往在大通佛所，未結大緣已前歷諸味中並聞三教，及至法華雖聞圓頓，但成結緣如繫珠也。	08b	After eating the feast, it is digested, like the expedient teachings that do not benefit ultimately. In the past, before the great affinity was formed at the time of the Buddha Dīpaṃkara, they experienced the various flavors and heard the three teachings. Even when they heard the perfect and sudden teaching at the Lotus Sūtra, they only formed karmic affinity like tying a pearl.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c07_15']	「無價」至「真如智寶也」者，此是約教，乃以了因而為繫珠。	「無價」至「真如智寶也」者，此是約教，乃以了因而為繫珠。	08b	Priceless up to the treasure of true suchness wisdom - this is in terms of the teachings, using the understanding cause as the tied jewel.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c08_18']	教中詮理故云「真如」，教是智用故云「智寶」。	教中詮理故云「真如」，教是智用故云「智寶」。	08b	Because the teachings expound the principle, it is called true suchness, and because the teachings are the function of wisdom, it is called the treasure of wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c10_3']	約受化者，教能生智亦名為智，寶有二義，俱是智家之寶。	約受化者，教能生智亦名為智，寶有二義，俱是智家之寶。	08b	In terms of those who receive the teachings, the teachings can give rise to wisdom and are also called wisdom. The treasure has two meanings, both being treasures of wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c11_14']	「繫其衣裏」者，初結緣時具足二衣，具慚愧故、有信樂故，方能結緣；	「繫其衣裏」者，初結緣時具足二衣，具慚愧故、有信樂故，方能結緣；	08b	Tied to the inner garment - when first forming the connection, one is fully endowed with the two garments, because one has a sense of shame and because one has faith and joy, one is then able to form the connection;
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c15_13']	退大墮惡則無外衣，若約現無信樂乃似內衣亦無，且據當時所繫內種仍存與本信俱，義如內衣猶在，但是衣弊非全無衣，故親友示還示衣裏，即是示本慚信時也。	退大墮惡則無外衣，若約現無信樂乃似內衣亦無，且據當時所繫內種仍存與本信俱，義如內衣猶在，但是衣弊非全無衣，故親友示還示衣裏，即是示本慚信時也。	08b	Retreating from the great [vehicle] and falling into evil would be without the outer garment. If one is currently without faith and joy, it would seem that the inner garment is also absent. However, it is based on the inner seeds that were tied at that time still existing and remaining together with the original faith. The meaning is like the inner garment still being there. It is just that the garment is worn out, not that there is no garment at all. Therefore, when the close friend shows the garment, it is showing the time when the sense of shame and faith were originally present.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c16_8']	據此而言，無衣繫身理亦無失。	據此而言，無衣繫身理亦無失。	08b	Based on this, it can be said that there is no error in the principle of the garment being tied to the body.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c19_1']	「起已遊行」至「求於小乘衣食」者，應更求於寶衣天饌，而但求於纔蔽身之衣、劣充軀之食者，由向他國故也。	「起已遊行」至「求於小乘衣食」者，應更求於寶衣天饌，而但求於纔蔽身之衣、劣充軀之食者，由向他國故也。	08b	Having arisen, he roams about up to seeking the small vehicle's clothing and food should further seek precious clothing and heavenly delicacies, but only seeks clothing barely covering the body and inferior food to fill the body, because he has gone to other countries.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c20_9']	文中二釋他義皆成，若論有求今日稍切，故云「厭苦」等。	文中二釋他義皆成，若論有求今日稍切，故云「厭苦」等。	08b	In the text, both explanations of the meaning of other are established. If discussing the seeking today, it is slightly urgent, thus it says disgust with suffering and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c23_8']	「若魔佛相望」等者，今日初得小乘之他，且從大小以說，故知若往他國求濟，非但衣食不充，亦迷所繫之寶，示珠之友居本土故。	「若魔佛相望」等者，今日初得小乘之他，且從大小以說，故知若往他國求濟，非但衣食不充，亦迷所繫之寶，示珠之友居本土故。	08b	If comparing Māra and the Buddha and so forth, today he first obtains the other of the small vehicle, for now speaking from large and small, thus it is known that if going to other countries to seek relief, not only is clothing and food insufficient, he also becomes confused about the treasure to which he is bound, because the friend who shows the pearl resides in his own country.
['ZH_T34_1719_08b:0303c27_16']	「勸貿譬得記作佛意」者，珠雖價直無數眾寶，必須貿易方有濟用，了因內解雖復究竟，必以種易現，以昔一解一切解而貿一行一切行，珠體不竭貿亦無窮，故須更聽更修方顯寶之功用。	「勸貿譬得記作佛意」者，珠雖價直無數眾寶，必須貿易方有濟用，了因內解雖復究竟，必以種易現，以昔一解一切解而貿一行一切行，珠體不竭貿亦無窮，故須更聽更修方顯寶之功用。	08b	As for the meaning of the analogy of encouraging trade to obtain the prediction of becoming a Buddha, although the pearl has countless precious treasures, it must be traded in order to have a use. Although the internal understanding of the direct cause is ultimate, it must use the present to trade the past. Using one understanding to understand all, and trading one practice to practice all, the essence of the pearl is inexhaustible and the trading is also endless.
