['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a15_16']	六隨眠中見行異為五，餘非見五，積數總成十，故於十中五是見性，一有身見、二邊執見、三邪見、四見取、五戒禁取。	六隨眠中見行異為五，餘非見五，積數總成十，故於十中五是見性，一有身見、二邊執見、三邪見、四見取、五戒禁取。	046	Among the six latent afflictions, the view of self and existence, the view of clinging to extremes, wrong views, the view of holding a view as paramount, and the view of holding morality and asceticism as paramount are distinguished by the differences in their activity as views. The remaining five are not views. When their numbers are added together, they become ten. Therefore, among the ten, five are of the nature of views, namely the view of self and existence, the view of clinging to extremes, wrong views, the view of holding a view as paramount, and the view of holding morality and asceticism as paramount.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a16_17']	五非見性，一貪、二瞋、三慢、四無明、五疑。	五非見性，一貪、二瞋、三慢、四無明、五疑。	046	Five are not of the nature of views, namely craving, hatred, pride, ignorance, and doubt.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a17_4']	見與非見合成十種。	見與非見合成十種。	046	Views and non-views are combined into ten types.

['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a19_0']	六行部界異，　　故成九十八，	六行部界異，　　故成九十八，	046	Because of the differences in practice, category, and realm, they become ninety-eight.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a20_13']	欲見苦等斷，　　十七七八四。	欲見苦等斷，　　十七七八四。	046	In the desire realm, those eliminated by seeing suffering, etc., are seventeen, seven, eight, and four.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a21_0']	謂如次具離，　　三二見見疑，	謂如次具離，　　三二見見疑，	046	That is, in order, completely free from three, two, views, and views and doubts.

['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a23_2']	論曰：	論曰：	046	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a24_1']	六種隨眠由行、部、界、門差別故，成九十八。	六種隨眠由行、部、界、門差別故，成九十八。	046	The six kinds of latent afflictions become ninety-eight because of the differences in practice, category, and realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a24_19']	謂於六中由見行異建立為十，如前已辯。	謂於六中由見行異建立為十，如前已辯。	046	That is to say, among the six, they are established as ten due to the differences in practice and views, as has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a26_18']	即此所辯十種隨眠，部、界不同成九十八，部謂見四諦修所斷五部，界謂欲色無色三界。	即此所辯十種隨眠，部、界不同成九十八，部謂見四諦修所斷五部，界謂欲色無色三界。	046	These ten kinds of latent afflictions, due to the differences in category and realm, become ninety-eight. The categories refer to the five categories of elimination by seeing the four truths and by cultivation. The realms refer to the three realms of desire, form, and formlessness.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a27_18']	且於欲界五部不同，乘十隨眠，成三十六。	且於欲界五部不同，乘十隨眠，成三十六。	046	First, in the desire realm, due to the differences in the five categories, multiplied by the ten latent afflictions, there are thirty-six.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601a28_15']	謂見苦諦至修所斷，如次有十七七八。	謂見苦諦至修所斷，如次有十七七八。	046	That is, when one sees the truth of suffering, there are seventeen to be eliminated by the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b01_8']	四即上五部於十隨眠，一二一一如其次第，具離三見、二見、見、疑。	四即上五部於十隨眠，一二一一如其次第，具離三見、二見、見、疑。	046	The four are the five classes above. In the ten proclivities, one, two, one, and one are respectively completely devoid of three views, two views, views, and doubt.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b02_4']	謂見苦諦所斷具十，一切皆違見苦諦故。	謂見苦諦所斷具十，一切皆違見苦諦故。	046	That is, those eliminated by seeing the truth of suffering are all ten, because they all oppose the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b03_4']	見集滅諦所斷各七，離有身見、邊見、戒取。	見集滅諦所斷各七，離有身見、邊見、戒取。	046	Those eliminated by seeing the truths of accumulation and cessation are seven each, devoid of the view of the aggregates, extreme views, and the taking of precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b03_18']	見道諦所斷八，於前七增戒取。	見道諦所斷八，於前七增戒取。	046	Those eliminated by seeing the truth of the path are eight, increasing the taking of precepts to seven above.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b04_7']	修所斷四，離見及疑。	修所斷四，離見及疑。	046	Those eliminated by cultivation are four, devoid of views and doubt.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b04_16']	如是合成三十六種。	如是合成三十六種。	046	Thus, there are thirty-six kinds in all.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b05_14']	前三十二名見所斷，纔見諦時彼則斷故。	前三十二名見所斷，纔見諦時彼則斷故。	046	The first thirty-two are called eliminated by seeing, because they are eliminated merely by seeing the truths.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b07_3']	最後有四名修所斷，見四諦已後後時中數數習道彼方斷故。	最後有四名修所斷，見四諦已後後時中數數習道彼方斷故。	046	The last four are called eliminated by cultivation, because after seeing the four truths, they are eliminated by repeatedly cultivating the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b08_9']	由此已顯十隨眠中薩迦耶見唯在一部，謂見苦所斷；	由此已顯十隨眠中薩迦耶見唯在一部，謂見苦所斷；	046	This already shows that among the ten proclivities, the view of the aggregates is only in one class, namely, eliminated by seeing suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b08_15']	邊執見亦爾。	邊執見亦爾。	046	The extreme view is also like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b09_12']	戒禁取通在二部，謂見苦、見道所斷。	戒禁取通在二部，謂見苦、見道所斷。	046	The grasping of precepts and vows is common to the two parts, namely, that which is eliminated by seeing suffering and that which is eliminated by seeing the truth of the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b10_6']	邪見通四部，謂見苦集滅道所斷；	邪見通四部，謂見苦集滅道所斷；	046	Wrong views are common to the four parts, namely, that which is eliminated by seeing the truths of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path;
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b10_12']	見取疑亦爾。	見取疑亦爾。	046	The view of grasping views and doubt are also like this.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b11_11']	餘貪等四各通五部，謂見四諦及修所斷。	餘貪等四各通五部，謂見四諦及修所斷。	046	The remaining four, such as craving, are common to the five parts, namely, that which is eliminated by seeing the four truths and that which is eliminated by cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b12_1']	如是總說見分十二。	如是總說見分十二。	046	In this way, it is generally said that the seen part is twelve.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b12_20']	疑分為四，餘四各五，故欲界中有三十六。	疑分為四，餘四各五，故欲界中有三十六。	046	Doubt is divided into four, and the remaining four are each five. Therefore, there are thirty-six in the desire realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b13_8']	經主於此自問答言：	經主於此自問答言：	046	The author of the treatise asks and answers himself here, saying:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b13_17']	此中何相見苦所斷？	此中何相見苦所斷？	046	What are the characteristics of that which is eliminated by seeing suffering?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b14_7']	乃至何相是修所斷？	乃至何相是修所斷？	046	Up to what are the characteristics of that which is eliminated by cultivation?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b15_8']	若緣見此所斷為境名見，此所斷餘名修所斷。	若緣見此所斷為境名見，此所斷餘名修所斷。	046	If it is called seeing this and that which is eliminated by seeing this, the rest is called that which is eliminated by cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b15_13']	此不應理。	此不應理。	046	This is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b15_18']	所以者何？	所以者何？	046	Why is it so?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b17_8']	遍行隨眠緣五部故，則見苦集所斷隨眠亦應通是見集苦等所斷。	遍行隨眠緣五部故，則見苦集所斷隨眠亦應通是見集苦等所斷。	046	Because the pervasive latent afflictions take the five parts as objects, then the latent afflictions eliminated by seeing suffering and accumulation should also be common to that which is eliminated by seeing accumulation, suffering, and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b18_10']	又見滅道所斷隨眠，緣非所斷法，當言何所斷？	又見滅道所斷隨眠，緣非所斷法，當言何所斷？	046	Also, the proclivities eliminated by the paths of insight into cessation and path, taking as their objects the factors not subject to elimination, should be said to be eliminated by what?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b19_2']	故彼非善立所斷相應言。	故彼非善立所斷相應言。	046	Therefore the characteristics of elimination as stated by the opponent are not correct.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b21_6']	若見緣苦為境名為見苦，即是苦法、苦類智忍此二所斷，總說名為見苦所斷，乃至見道所斷亦然。	若見緣苦為境名為見苦，即是苦法、苦類智忍此二所斷，總說名為見苦所斷，乃至見道所斷亦然。	046	If one sees suffering as an object, it is called the insight into suffering. It is eliminated by the two, namely, the receptivity to the cognition of the factors with regard to suffering and the receptivity to the subsequent cognition with regard to suffering. All are generally called eliminated by the insight into suffering. The same is so with the insight into the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b22_1']	數習名修，謂見迹者為得上義。	數習名修，謂見迹者為得上義。	046	Cultivation is called repeated practice. That is, the one who has left the stage of the seeker cultivates the superior meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b23_13']	於苦等智數數熏習說名為修，此道所除名修所斷，是名為善立所斷相。	於苦等智數數熏習說名為修，此道所除名修所斷，是名為善立所斷相。	046	The cognition of suffering, etc., is cultivated repeatedly. That which is eliminated by this path is called eliminated by cultivation. This is called the correct characteristics of elimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b24_15']	色無色界五部各除瞋，餘與欲同，故各三十一。	色無色界五部各除瞋，餘與欲同，故各三十一。	046	The five classes of proclivities in the realm of form and the formless realm, excluding anger, are the same as those of the realm of desire, each consisting of thirty-one.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b26_3']	由是一切正理論師，以六隨眠約行、部、界、門差別故立九十八。	由是一切正理論師，以六隨眠約行、部、界、門差別故立九十八。	046	Therefore all the masters of the Abhidharma-saṃuccaya establish ninety-eight proclivities by means of the distinctions of the doors of action, class, and realm, based on the six proclivities.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b27_4']	於此所辯九十八中，八十八見所斷，忍所害故。	於此所辯九十八中，八十八見所斷，忍所害故。	046	Of the ninety-eight proclivities that have been discussed, eighty-eight are eliminated by the path of insight, because they are destroyed by the receptivity.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b27_16']	十隨眠修所斷，智所害故。	十隨眠修所斷，智所害故。	046	The ten proclivities that are eliminated by cultivation are destroyed by the knowledge of the path, and therefore they are said to be destroyed by the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601b28_14']	何緣於此約界不同建立隨眠，非約地異？	何緣於此約界不同建立隨眠，非約地異？	046	Why are the proclivities established as being different in the realm but not different in the stage?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c01_3', 'ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c03_5']	如無欲色異界隨眠於一事中俱隨增理，初二靜慮異地亦然。🔽若謂地雖殊而有同對治，非欲色界對治有同，是則不應別立無色，以無色與色有同對治故。	如無欲色異界隨眠於一事中俱隨增理，初二靜慮異地亦然。 若謂地雖殊而有同對治，非欲色界對治有同，是則不應別立無色，以無色與色有同對治故。	046	Just as the proclivities of the realm of desire and the realm of form are different, but the proclivities of the two meditations are the same in that they are both of the first trance state.🔽If you say that the proclivities of the two meditations are not the same because they have different antidotes, then you should not establish a separate formless realm, because the formless realm and the form realm have the same antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c04_14']	若修所斷對治漸生，故色無色應別立者，諸地亦爾，何不別說？	若修所斷對治漸生，故色無色應別立者，諸地亦爾，何不別說？	046	If you say that the form realm and the formless realm are established separately because the antidotes to the proclivities eliminated by the path of cultivation are gradually generated, then the stages should be established separately, and why do you not say that they are?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c05_6']	故應立二百八十四隨眠。	故應立二百八十四隨眠。	046	Therefore you should establish two hundred and eighty-four proclivities.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c06_5']	設許如斯亦無有過，且約界異立九十八。	設許如斯亦無有過，且約界異立九十八。	046	Even if we grant that this is so, there is still no error, because we establish ninety-eight proclivities on the basis of the difference in realms.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c07_4']	所以然者，由離界貪建立遍知沙門果故。	所以然者，由離界貪建立遍知沙門果故。	046	Why is this so? Because the abandonment of the passions of the realms is established as the complete knowledge of the passions and as the fruit of the religious life.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c08_12']	謂立此二由斷隨眠，此斷隨眠約界非地，故不約地建立隨眠。	謂立此二由斷隨眠，此斷隨眠約界非地，故不約地建立隨眠。	046	That is, these two are established by the severing of the latent afflictions. The severing of the latent afflictions is based on the realms, not on the stages. Therefore, the latent afflictions are not established based on the stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c08_17']	宿舊師言：	宿舊師言：	046	The ancient masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c11_1']	佛於法性明了通達能說示他，定應善觀四靜慮地諸煩惱法性少相似，雖有四地而合說一。	佛於法性明了通達能說示他，定應善觀四靜慮地諸煩惱法性少相似，雖有四地而合說一。	046	The Buddha clearly and thoroughly understands the nature of dharmas and is able to teach others. He must have well observed that the nature of the afflictions in the four dhyāna stages is slightly similar. Although there are four stages, he combines them and speaks of them as one.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c12_2']	於四無色合說亦然，經但說色貪、無色貪等故。	於四無色合說亦然，經但說色貪、無色貪等故。	046	The same is true for the four formless [absorptions]. The sūtra only speaks of desire for form and desire for the formless, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c13_1']	由此義故，正理論師建立隨眠約界非地。	由此義故，正理論師建立隨眠約界非地。	046	For this reason, the masters of the Nyāyānusāra śāstra establish the latent afflictions based on the realms, not on the stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c13_10']	如何四地性少相似？	如何四地性少相似？	046	How are the natures of the four stages slightly similar?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c13_13']	有說：	有說：	046	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c14_1']	同是攝支地故。	同是攝支地故。	046	Because they are all stages that include branches.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c14_6']	此釋非理。	此釋非理。	046	This explanation is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c14_11']	所以者何？	所以者何？	046	Why is it so?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c15_2']	諸近分地中有生煩惱故。	諸近分地中有生煩惱故。	046	Because there are afflictions that arise in the preliminary stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c15_5']	有說：	有說：	046	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c15_13']	同是遍照地攝故。	同是遍照地攝故。	046	Because they are all included in the stage of universal illumination.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c15_16']	有說：	有說：	046	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c16_3']	等是色貪類惑故。	等是色貪類惑故。	046	Because they are all afflictions that are of the same type as desire for form.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c19_10']	我說此中少相似者，唯薄伽梵明了通達，要於永斷第四靜慮下下品惑方立遍知，下位不然，故知四地必有少分性類相似，非上地煩惱能緣縛下地。	我說此中少相似者，唯薄伽梵明了通達，要於永斷第四靜慮下下品惑方立遍知，下位不然，故知四地必有少分性類相似，非上地煩惱能緣縛下地。	046	I say that there is a slight similarity here, but only the Bhagavān clearly understands. One establishes the complete knowledge only after permanently eliminating the lowest of the low category of passions of the fourth trance state. It is not so for lower stages. Therefore, we know that the four stages must have a slight similarity in their natures. The passions of higher stages cannot bind lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c20_10']	下三靜慮得離繫時，寧不別立斷遍知體？	下三靜慮得離繫時，寧不別立斷遍知體？	046	When one obtains freedom from the bonds of the first three trance states, why does one not establish a separate essence of complete knowledge of elimination?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c21_8']	定知一類煩惱未除，雖已離繫與繫相似。	定知一類煩惱未除，雖已離繫與繫相似。	046	One definitely knows that a class of passions has not yet been eliminated. Although one has already been freed from the bonds, it is similar to being bound.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c23_7']	要同類惑永斷無餘，方得名為究竟離繫，故唯約界建立隨眠，不約地立，於理為勝。	要同類惑永斷無餘，方得名為究竟離繫，故唯約界建立隨眠，不約地立，於理為勝。	046	Only when the passions of the same class are permanently eliminated without remainder can one be said to have finally been freed from the bonds. Therefore, it is best to establish the latent propensities only according to the realms and not according to the stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c23_12']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	046	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c25_13']	如有為怨禁在囹圄，方便走出，乃至未到與怨城林田空閑等不相似處，雖越怨獄未大安隱。	如有為怨禁在囹圄，方便走出，乃至未到與怨城林田空閑等不相似處，雖越怨獄未大安隱。	046	It is like having an enemy who is imprisoned in a jail. One escapes by skillful means, but as long as one has not reached a place that is not similar to the enemy's city, forest, fields, or wilderness, although one has escaped from the enemy's prison, one is not yet greatly at ease.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0601c27_11']	如是若斷下三定貪，未到彼貪不相似處，雖越少分未大安隱，故唯約界建立隨眠。	如是若斷下三定貪，未到彼貪不相似處，雖越少分未大安隱，故唯約界建立隨眠。	046	Thus, if one severs attachment to the lower three concentrations, one has not yet reached a place that is not similar to that attachment. Although one has transcended a small part, one is still not greatly at ease. Therefore, only in terms of realms are dormant afflictions established.

First, let us cite a sutra passage to prove that the four meditations are not of the same bond.🔽As a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a17_1']	如契經言，彼作是思：	如契經言，彼作是思：	046	He thinks like this:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a17_14']	我當安住尋伺寂靜第二定中。	我當安住尋伺寂靜第二定中。	046	I will dwell in the second meditation, which is the tranquility of investigation and analysis.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a18_9']	雖作是思而不能入，復作是念：	雖作是思而不能入，復作是念：	046	Although he thinks like this, he is unable to enter. He further thinks:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a19_3']	何因何緣，我於此中心不能入？	何因何緣，我於此中心不能入？	046	For what reason and what cause is my mind unable to enter this?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a23_17']	作是念已便自了知，以我猶於尋伺過患未識未達、未見未知，於無尋伺靜慮功德未能修習多修習故，於第二定心不能入，廣說乃至，我由住此數數發動尋伺俱行，諸想作意過患令起，今定應斷，乃至廣說。	作是念已便自了知，以我猶於尋伺過患未識未達、未見未知，於無尋伺靜慮功德未能修習多修習故，於第二定心不能入，廣說乃至，我由住此數數發動尋伺俱行，諸想作意過患令起，今定應斷，乃至廣說。	046	Having had this thought, he then understands by himself that it is because he has not yet recognized, penetrated, seen, or known the faults of investigation and analysis, and has not yet been able to cultivate and extensively cultivate the virtues of the meditation free from investigation and analysis, therefore his mind is unable to enter the second meditation. This is explained in detail, up to: Because I dwell in this [first meditation] and frequently activate thoughts and intentions accompanied by investigation and analysis, which give rise to faults. Now I must definitely eliminate them. And so on, in detail.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a25_9']	此中意顯，如越欲界，如是當越靜慮地等下地所有諸想作意能障離染。	此中意顯，如越欲界，如是當越靜慮地等下地所有諸想作意能障離染。	046	The meaning of this passage is that just as one transcends the realm of desire, so too one transcends the thoughts and ideas of the lower stages, such as the meditations, etc., which are obstacles to the abandonment of passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a26_13']	及能退故，說為過患非自地者，故知色界非一繫縛。	及能退故，說為過患非自地者，故知色界非一繫縛。	046	And because they cause one to fall back, they are said to be harmful. Those of the same stage are not so, and therefore we know that the realm of form is not a single bondage.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a27_13']	又見過患能為厭因，厭為離因，離故解脫。	又見過患能為厭因，厭為離因，離故解脫。	046	Also, seeing the harmful aspects is the cause of disgust, and disgust is the cause of abandonment, and because of abandonment, one is liberated.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a28_3']	若同一縛，此應唐捐。	若同一縛，此應唐捐。	046	If there were a single bondage, this would be useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602a28_17']	又說尋等漸次息故，謂契經說：	又說尋等漸次息故，謂契經說：	046	Also, it is said that investigation, etc., are gradually eliminated. The scriptures say:
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b01_10']	若瑜伽師入第二定尋伺便息，廣說乃至，得入無邊虛空處定，色想便息。	若瑜伽師入第二定尋伺便息，廣說乃至，得入無邊虛空處定，色想便息。	046	If a yogin enters the second meditation, investigation and analysis cease, and so on, up to entering the concentration of infinite space, then the idea of form ceases.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b03_16']	色界諸地若同一縛，諸瑜伽者既無力能頓捨尋伺喜樂色想，以心怖怯極重擔故，應畢竟無捨尋等者。	色界諸地若同一縛，諸瑜伽者既無力能頓捨尋伺喜樂色想，以心怖怯極重擔故，應畢竟無捨尋等者。	046	If the stages of the realm of form were a single bondage, then since the yogins would be powerless to suddenly abandon investigation, analysis, joy, pleasure, and the idea of form, because their minds would be frightened and timid, as if bearing a heavy burden, they would never abandon investigation, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b04_11']	又說離喜斷樂言故，謂契經言：	又說離喜斷樂言故，謂契經言：	046	Also, because it is said that one abandons joy and cuts off pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b05_1']	離喜斷樂非同一縛。	離喜斷樂非同一縛。	046	The abandonment of joy and the abandonment of pleasure are not the same as one bond.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b07_13']	欲界諸處有毛端量未得離貪，可說名為全離欲繫，唯除已斷見所斷法，雖永未離修所斷貪而名離縛，非彼境故。	欲界諸處有毛端量未得離貪，可說名為全離欲繫，唯除已斷見所斷法，雖永未離修所斷貪而名離縛，非彼境故。	046	In all the realms of the desire realm, there is not even a hair's breadth of non-abandonment of craving. One can say that one completely abandons the bonds of desire, except for the dharmas abandoned by seeing, which are permanently not yet abandoned. Although one has not yet abandoned the craving abandoned by cultivation, one is said to abandon the bonds, because they are not objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b08_13']	色界諸地若同一縛，應有餘縛，離斷不成。	色界諸地若同一縛，應有餘縛，離斷不成。	046	If the various stages of the form realm were the same as one bond, there would be other bonds, and the abandonment would not be accomplished.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b09_2']	此等名為經相違故。	此等名為經相違故。	046	These are called the reasons of contradiction with the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b10_1']	次引論文證四靜慮非同一繫，如本論言：	次引論文證四靜慮非同一繫，如本論言：	046	Next, citing the treatise to prove that the four meditations are not the same as one bond, as the Abhidharma-śāstra says:

['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b11_7', 'ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b11_17']	誰於此不成？🔽謂異生生上非下地法。	誰於此不成？ 謂異生生上非下地法。	046	Who does not possess it here?🔽Ordinary beings born in higher stages, not in lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b12_15']	生上地時雖曰不成，而不由斷於同一縛。	生上地時雖曰不成，而不由斷於同一縛。	046	Even though one is said not to possess it when born in higher stages, it is not due to abandoning the same bond.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b15_8']	欲界等中不見如斯定成等理，然於本論說遍行因為因能生自界染者，且就約界建立隨眠辯遍行因，故作是說。	欲界等中不見如斯定成等理，然於本論說遍行因為因能生自界染者，且就約界建立隨眠辯遍行因，故作是說。	046	In the desire realm and so on, we do not see such a principle of definite possession. However, in the treatise, it is said that the universal cause as a cause can give rise to the defilements of its own realm. This is said only in terms of the universal cause established according to the realms, in order to discuss the universal cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b15_17']	亦有本說生自地染。	亦有本說生自地染。	046	There are also original treatises that say it gives rise to the defilements of its own stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b16_7']	此等名為論相違故。	此等名為論相違故。	046	These are called contradictions in the treatises.

['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b18_9']	且與隨經理相違者，不應於二定說內等淨支，未斷尋伺俱諸煩惱濁故。	且與隨經理相違者，不應於二定說內等淨支，未斷尋伺俱諸煩惱濁故。	046	First, as for contradicting the sūtras, it should not be said that internal purity is a factor in the two meditative absorptions, because the defilements that accompany investigation and analysis have not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b19_17']	又生第四靜慮有情，亦應成染尋伺喜樂，然契經說尋等息言。	又生第四靜慮有情，亦應成染尋伺喜樂，然契經說尋等息言。	046	Moreover, beings in the fourth meditative absorption should also have defiled investigation, analysis, joy, and pleasure, yet the sūtras say that investigation and so on cease.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b20_7']	又契經言離喜斷樂。	又契經言離喜斷樂。	046	Moreover, the sūtras say that one abandons joy and severs pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b22_14']	與隨本論理相違者，謂本論中說第二等味相應定，能與初等味相應定唯作二緣，謂增上緣及等無間。	與隨本論理相違者，謂本論中說第二等味相應定，能與初等味相應定唯作二緣，謂增上緣及等無間。	046	As for contradicting the original treatises, the original treatises say that the second meditative absorption and so on that are associated with enjoyment can only act as two conditions for the first meditative absorption and so on that are associated with enjoyment: the dominant condition and the condition as an equivalent and immediate antecedent.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b24_3']	色界諸地若同一縛，諸上地貪於下地愛亦應能作因及所緣。	色界諸地若同一縛，諸上地貪於下地愛亦應能作因及所緣。	046	If the various stages of the realm of form are bound by the same bonds, then craving of the higher stages should be able to act as the cause and object of craving of the lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b24_15']	又除受生時，應為等無間。	又除受生時，應為等無間。	046	Moreover, with the exception of the time of rebirth, it should be the similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b25_13']	又初定愛乃至應與第四定貪為等無間。	又初定愛乃至應與第四定貪為等無間。	046	Moreover, craving of the first trance state should be the similar and immediately antecedent condition for craving of the fourth trance state.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b26_13']	又應從初味定無間，乃至第四淨定現前。	又應從初味定無間，乃至第四淨定現前。	046	Moreover, immediately after the first trance state of enjoyment, up to the fourth pure trance state should appear.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b27_11']	又除受生，應從第四淨定無間初味定起。	又除受生，應從第四淨定無間初味定起。	046	Moreover, with the exception of rebirth, the first trance state of enjoyment should appear immediately after the fourth pure trance state.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b28_11']	如是上下等無間緣，展轉相生應立多難。	如是上下等無間緣，展轉相生應立多難。	046	In this way, the similar and immediately antecedent condition of the upper and lower stages should be established as producing each other, and many difficulties should be raised.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602b29_11']	又不應於第四業內說四思能斷白白異熟業。	又不應於第四業內說四思能斷白白異熟業。	046	Moreover, in the fourth action, it should not be said that the four kinds of volition can sever the action of pure white retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c01_11']	又不應說上近分定能斷下惑，同一縛故。	又不應說上近分定能斷下惑，同一縛故。	046	Moreover, it should not be said that the proximate concentration of the upper stages can sever the passions of the lower stages, because they are bound by the same bonds.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c02_10']	又得初定諸不還者，與得四定所斷應同。	又得初定諸不還者，與得四定所斷應同。	046	Moreover, those who have attained the first trance state and are nonreturners should be the same as those who have attained the four trance states and have severed the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c03_18']	是故定應許上下地，如界業惑因果皆殊，由理不同，一繫縛故。	是故定應許上下地，如界業惑因果皆殊，由理不同，一繫縛故。	046	Therefore it must be admitted that the upper and lower stages are bound by the same fetter, just as the realms, actions, and passions are different in cause and effect. Because of the difference in principle, they are bound by the same fetter.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c04_16']	如前所說上界除瞋，以何因緣彼瞋非有？	如前所說上界除瞋，以何因緣彼瞋非有？	046	As previously stated, anger is excluded in the upper realms. For what reason is anger not present there?
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c06_6']	彼瞋隨眠事非有故，謂於苦受有瞋隨增，苦受彼無，故瞋非有。	彼瞋隨眠事非有故，謂於苦受有瞋隨增，苦受彼無，故瞋非有。	046	Because the occurrence of the latent tendency of anger is not present there. That is to say, anger increases in accordance with painful feelings, but they do not have painful feelings, and therefore anger is not present there.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c08_12']	又瞋隨眠乾澁相故，謂此煩惱其相乾澁猶如風病，彼有情類由奢摩他潤滑相續，故彼無有乾澁相瞋。	又瞋隨眠乾澁相故，謂此煩惱其相乾澁猶如風病，彼有情類由奢摩他潤滑相續，故彼無有乾澁相瞋。	046	Moreover, the latent tendency of anger is characterized by dryness and coarseness. That is to say, this passion has the characteristic of dryness and coarseness, like a disease of wind. The continuity of those sentient beings is moistened by samādhi, and therefore they do not have the coarse and rough anger.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c11_1']	又彼非瞋異熟因故，謂瞋必感非愛異熟，上二界無諸非愛事，外無毒刺茅灰等緣，內無熱風癲癎等故。	又彼非瞋異熟因故，謂瞋必感非愛異熟，上二界無諸非愛事，外無毒刺茅灰等緣，內無熱風癲癎等故。	046	Moreover, it is because it is not the cause of the retribution of anger. That is to say, anger necessarily produces unpleasant retribution, but there are no unpleasant things in the upper two realms. There are no external causes such as poisonous thorns or alkaline soil, and no internal causes such as hot winds or epilepsy.

['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c18_14']	由此故知正理論者唯依自計立九十八隨眠。	由此故知正理論者唯依自計立九十八隨眠。	046	Therefore we know that the author of the Nyāyānusāra only established ninety-eight latent afflictions based on his own ideas.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c20_5']	若離聖言依自計立，則應許有無量隨眠，無量有情身中轉故。	若離聖言依自計立，則應許有無量隨眠，無量有情身中轉故。	046	If one were to establish them based on one's own ideas apart from the holy teachings, then one would have to admit that there are innumerable latent afflictions, because innumerable sentient beings have them.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0602c22_3']	今觀具壽於聖教理不能審諦如實觀察，於此所立理教極成隨眠數中能固非撥。	今觀具壽於聖教理不能審諦如實觀察，於此所立理教極成隨眠數中能固非撥。	046	Now we observe that the Venerable One is unable to carefully and accurately contemplate the principles and teachings of the holy teachings, and is unable to firmly deny the number of latent afflictions that are well established by reasoning and teachings.

Now, the differences in the form and formless realms of those only eliminated by cultivation are shown in particular, because they are eliminated in this way by the pure path.
['ZH_T29_1562_046:0603b21_8']	謂色無色見所斷貪同一對治，修所斷貪各別對治，故於定界見所斷貪不顯界別，修所斷貪則顯界別。	謂色無色見所斷貪同一對治，修所斷貪各別對治，故於定界見所斷貪不顯界別，修所斷貪則顯界別。	046	That is, craving for form and formless realms that is to be eliminated by the path of insight has the same antidote, while craving to be eliminated by cultivation has different antidotes for each realm. Therefore, craving to be eliminated by the path of insight in the realm of form and the formless realm is not distinguished according to realm, but craving to be eliminated by the path of cultivation is distinguished according to realm.
