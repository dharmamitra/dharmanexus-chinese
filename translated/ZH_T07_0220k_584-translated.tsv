There are roughly two kinds of entry into the Buddha's teachings:
['ZH_T07_0220k_584:1037b13_4']	一、有菩薩無方便善巧故，雖聞世間種種善法心不貪染，而聞二乘所有功德心便愛味，由愛味故精勤攝受，遠離所求一切智智，退失無上正等覺心；	一、有菩薩無方便善巧故，雖聞世間種種善法心不貪染，而聞二乘所有功德心便愛味，由愛味故精勤攝受，遠離所求一切智智，退失無上正等覺心；	584	First, there are bodhisattvas who, due to lacking skillful means, although they hear various worldly good dharmas and their minds are not attached, yet they hear the merits of the two vehicles and their minds delight in them. Due to delighting in them, they diligently grasp them and are far removed from the omniscience they seek, and lose the mind of unsurpassed perfect enlightenment;
['ZH_T07_0220k_584:1037b14_11']	如彼初人見少價寶雖不貪著，而見多價貪著持還失無價寶。	如彼初人見少價寶雖不貪著，而見多價貪著持還失無價寶。	584	It is like the first person who, although not greedy for the small-priced jewel, still holds on to it out of greed for the large price, and loses the priceless jewel.
['ZH_T07_0220k_584:1037b18_1']	二、有菩薩有方便善巧故，初聞世間種種善法心不貪染，次聞二乘所有功德亦不愛味，由不愛味便不思惟，由不思惟便不修習，既不修習方便厭捨。	二、有菩薩有方便善巧故，初聞世間種種善法心不貪染，次聞二乘所有功德亦不愛味，由不愛味便不思惟，由不思惟便不修習，既不修習方便厭捨。	584	Second, there are bodhisattvas who, due to skillful means, initially do not become attached to the various worldly good dharmas when they hear about them. Next, when they hear about the merits and virtues of the two vehicles, they also do not savor them. Due to not savoring them, they do not contemplate them. Due to not contemplating them, they do not cultivate them. Since they do not cultivate them, they skillfully abandon them.
['ZH_T07_0220k_584:1037b18_6']	所以者何？	所以者何？	584	Why is this so?

['ZH_T07_0220k_584:1037b22_14']	聲聞、獨覺功德善根，雖出世間而但自利，不能普利一切有情，亦障所求一切智智，故不愛味亦不思惟，於彼善根不樂修習。	聲聞、獨覺功德善根，雖出世間而但自利，不能普利一切有情，亦障所求一切智智，故不愛味亦不思惟，於彼善根不樂修習。	584	The merits and virtues of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, although supramundane, only benefit themselves and are unable to universally benefit all beings, and also obstruct the pursuit of omniscience. Therefore, they do not savor them nor contemplate them, and do not enjoy cultivating those wholesome roots.
['ZH_T07_0220k_584:1037b24_3']	由斯超越彼二乘地，勤求無上正等菩提，漸次證得一切智智；	由斯超越彼二乘地，勤求無上正等菩提，漸次證得一切智智；	584	Because of this, they transcend the stages of the two vehicles and diligently seek unsurpassed perfect supreme enlightenment, gradually realizing the cognition of all knowledge.

They gradually go deeper to the most excellent place, obtain priceless jewels, and take them back as they wish, bringing great benefit to sentient beings.
['ZH_T07_0220k_584:1037c02_4']	「如是菩薩方便善巧，既不貪染世間善法，於二乘法亦不愛味，由斯漸次趣大菩提，修多百千難行苦行，供養恭敬無量如來，成熟有情、嚴淨佛土，至極圓滿得一切智，利益安樂無量有情，如無價寶多所饒益。	「如是菩薩方便善巧，既不貪染世間善法，於二乘法亦不愛味，由斯漸次趣大菩提，修多百千難行苦行，供養恭敬無量如來，成熟有情、嚴淨佛土，至極圓滿得一切智，利益安樂無量有情，如無價寶多所饒益。	584	In this way, the skillful means of bodhisattvas, not being attached to worldly good dharmas, also do not savor the dharmas of the two vehicles. Because of this, they gradually progress to great enlightenment, cultivating hundreds of thousands of difficult and painful practices, making offerings and respectfully serving immeasurable tathāgatas, maturing sentient beings and purifying buddha-lands, attaining the omniscience of perfect completion, benefiting and bringing peace to immeasurable sentient beings, like priceless jewels that bring much benefit.

Although they are able to realize them, they deeply detest and abandon them. Although they deeply detest and abandon them, they are able to skillfully explain them and benefit those beings, causing them to practice well and realize the bliss of nirvana.
