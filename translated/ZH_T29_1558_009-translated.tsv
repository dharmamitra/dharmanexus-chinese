['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c11_0']	此一業引故，　　如當本有形，	此一業引故，　　如當本有形，	Because this is attracted by one karma, it is like the form of the future fundamental existence.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c12_13']	本有謂死前，　　居生剎那後。	本有謂死前，　　居生剎那後。	The fundamental existence refers to the period after death but before rebirth.

['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c14_1']	若業能引當所往趣，彼業即招能往中有。	若業能引當所往趣，彼業即招能往中有。	If karma can attract the future destiny to which one will go, that karma will also attract the intermediate existence that can go there.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c15_1']	故此中有若往彼趣，即如所趣當本有形。	故此中有若往彼趣，即如所趣當本有形。	Therefore, if this intermediate existence is going to that destiny, it will have the form of the fundamental existence of that destiny.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c16_1']	若爾，於一狗等腹中容有五趣中有頓起。	若爾，於一狗等腹中容有五趣中有頓起。	If so, in the womb of a single dog, intermediate existences of the five destinies could suddenly arise.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c17_1']	既有地獄中有現前，如何不能焚燒母腹？	既有地獄中有現前，如何不能焚燒母腹？	Since there is a hell intermediate existence present, how can it not burn the mother's womb?
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c17_10']	彼居本有亦不恒燒？	彼居本有亦不恒燒？	Even when dwelling in the fundamental existence, it does not always burn.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c18_2']	如暫遊園，況在中有。	如暫遊園，況在中有。	It is like temporarily visiting a garden, let alone being in the intermediate existence.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c19_12']	設許能燒，如不可見亦不可觸，以中有身極微細故，所難非理。	設許能燒，如不可見亦不可觸，以中有身極微細故，所難非理。	Even if it is granted that it can be burned, it cannot be seen or touched, because the body of the intermediate state is extremely subtle. Therefore your objection is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c20_13']	諸趣中有雖居一腹，非互觸燒，業所遮故。	諸趣中有雖居一腹，非互觸燒，業所遮故。	Although the intermediate state beings of the various destinies are in the same womb, they do not touch or burn each other, because this is prevented by karma.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c21_11']	欲中有量雖如小兒年五六歲而根明利；	欲中有量雖如小兒年五六歲而根明利；	The size of the intermediate state being of the desire realm is like that of a child five or six years old, but its faculties are clear and sharp.

Therefore, when it is in the intermediate state and about to enter the womb, it illuminates a hundred koṭis of great trichiliocosms.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0045c24_13']	若爾，何故菩薩母夢中見白象子來入己右脇？	若爾，何故菩薩母夢中見白象子來入己右脇？	If this is so, why did the mother of the Bodhisattva see in a dream an elephant calf coming in through her right side?

['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a02_10']	又諸中有從生門入，非破母腹而得入胎，故雙生者前小後大。	又諸中有從生門入，非破母腹而得入胎，故雙生者前小後大。	Also, the intermediate beings enter through the birth passage, not by breaking the mother's abdomen to enter the womb. Therefore, twins are born first small and later large.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a03_1']	法善現說復云何通？	法善現說復云何通？	How does the Dharma master explain this?

['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a06_9']	不必須通，非三藏故。	不必須通，非三藏故。	It is not necessary to explain it, because it is not a tripiṭaka text.

['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a08_13']	色界中有量，圓滿如本有。	色界中有量，圓滿如本有。	The size of the intermediate being in the form realm is complete, like the original existence.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a09_12']	與衣俱生，慚愧增故，菩薩中有亦與衣俱。	與衣俱生，慚愧增故，菩薩中有亦與衣俱。	Born together with clothes, due to the increase of shame and modesty. The intermediate being of the Bodhisattva is also born together with clothes.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a12_4']	鮮白苾芻尼由本願力故，彼於世世有自然衣，恒不離身隨時改變，乃至最後般涅槃時，即以此衣纏屍焚葬。	鮮白苾芻尼由本願力故，彼於世世有自然衣，恒不離身隨時改變，乃至最後般涅槃時，即以此衣纏屍焚葬。	Because of the power of her original vow, the bhikṣuṇī Śaśivaktrā had a natural robe in every lifetime that never left her body and changed with the seasons, until the time of her final parinirvāṇa, when she wrapped her corpse in this robe and cremated it.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a13_4']	所餘欲界中有無衣，由皆增長無慚愧故。	所餘欲界中有無衣，由皆增長無慚愧故。	The rest of the desire realm has no clothes in the intermediate state, because they all increase shamelessness and lack of conscience.

['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a15_3']	於中位別分析為四：	於中位別分析為四：	Within this, the different stages are analyzed into four:
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a15_13']	一者中有，義如前說。	一者中有，義如前說。	The first is the intermediate existence, the meaning of which was explained above.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a16_7']	二者生有，謂於諸趣結生剎那。	二者生有，謂於諸趣結生剎那。	The second is birth existence, which refers to the moment of rebirth in the various destinies.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a17_3']	三者本有，除生剎那死前餘位。	三者本有，除生剎那死前餘位。	The third is prior existence, which refers to all stages except for the moment of birth and before death.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a17_13']	四者死有，謂最後念。	四者死有，謂最後念。	The fourth is death existence, which refers to the final thought.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046a18_16']	次中有前，有色有情具足四有，若在無色中闕具三。	次中有前，有色有情具足四有，若在無色中闕具三。	Next, in front of the intermediate existence, sentient beings with form are endowed with all four existences. If they are in the formless realm, they lack one and are endowed with three.

If one has cultivated and attained the extremely pure heavenly eye, one can also see them. All eyes obtained through birth cannot observe them, because they are extremely subtle.

['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b01_1']	一切通中業通最疾，𣣋虛自在是謂通義，通由業得名為業通，此通勢用速故名疾。	一切通中業通最疾，𣣋虛自在是謂通義，通由業得名為業通，此通勢用速故名疾。	Among all spiritual powers, the spiritual power of karma is the swiftest. It is called spiritual power because it freely surpasses the sky. Spiritual power obtained through karma is called the spiritual power of karma. This spiritual power is called swift because its power is fast.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b02_10']	中有具得最疾業通，上至世尊無能遮抑，以業勢力最強盛故。	中有具得最疾業通，上至世尊無能遮抑，以業勢力最強盛故。	There are those who attain the most rapid karmic powers, and even the World-Honored One cannot stop them, because the power of their karma is the strongest.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b04_1']	一切中有皆具五根，對謂對礙，此金剛等所不能遮，故名無對。	一切中有皆具五根，對謂對礙，此金剛等所不能遮，故名無對。	All intermediate beings are endowed with the five faculties. Obstruction means obstruction. This cannot be blocked by vajra and other things, so it is called unobstructed.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b07_3']	曾聞析破炎赤鐵團，見於其中有蟲生故，應往彼趣中有已生，一切種力皆不能轉，謂不可令人中有沒餘中有起，餘類亦然。	曾聞析破炎赤鐵團，見於其中有蟲生故，應往彼趣中有已生，一切種力皆不能轉，謂不可令人中有沒餘中有起，餘類亦然。	It is heard that when a red-hot iron ball is broken apart, insects are seen born inside. Therefore, the intermediate existence of those who should go to that realm has already arisen. All kinds of power cannot change it, meaning that one cannot cause the intermediate existence to disappear and another intermediate existence to arise. It is the same for other types.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b08_3']	為往彼趣中有已起，但應往彼，定不往餘。	為往彼趣中有已起，但應往彼，定不往餘。	The intermediate existence that should go to that realm has already arisen. It can only go there, definitely not elsewhere.

['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b12_12']	諸少福者唯食惡香，其多福者好香為食。	諸少福者唯食惡香，其多福者好香為食。	Those with little merit only eat foul-smelling food, while those with much merit eat good-smelling food.

Because their life faculty is not attracted by separate karma, it is the same as the general destiny of the person they are to become.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b16_4']	若異此者，中有命根最後滅時應立死有。	若異此者，中有命根最後滅時應立死有。	If it were otherwise, when the life faculty of the intermediate being finally ceased, it would be established as the intermediate existence at death.

Attached to smells and tastes, their lifespans are short. Those sentient beings, due to smelling this smell and being greedy for smells and tastes, die together at the same time. Due to the karma of craving and awareness that previously attracted the body of an insect, they simultaneously receive the body of a small insect here.
['ZH_T29_1558_009:0046b23_15']	或多有情應俱生此，多緣未合住中有中，今遇多緣方頓生此。	或多有情應俱生此，多緣未合住中有中，今遇多緣方頓生此。	Or many sentient beings should be born together here, but many conditions have not yet come together, so they dwell in the intermediate state. Now encountering many conditions, they suddenly take birth here.

Just as there is karma that can attract the results of being a wheel-turning king, it must be when the lifespan of humans is eighty thousand years or more than that before it suddenly gives results, not in other states.

Due to the power of karma, the eye faculty that is produced is able to see the parents engaging in sexual intercourse from a distance, and gives rise to a perverted mind.
