['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a08_1']	此據根本迷悟之境故說真如。	此據根本迷悟之境故說真如。	This is because it is the realm of fundamental delusion and enlightenment, and therefore it is said to be true suchness.

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a09_2']	加行緣空不斷惑故。	加行緣空不斷惑故。	This is because the preparatory stage takes emptiness as its object and does not eliminate delusion.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a09_13']	故說若證二空彼障隨斷。	故說若證二空彼障隨斷。	Therefore, it is said that if one realizes the two kinds of emptiness, those obstacles are eliminated accordingly.

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a13_6']	若據安惠樞要中有三解。	若據安惠樞要中有三解。	If we go by Sthiramati, there are three explanations in the Essentials.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a14_1']	第三云所知障中種．習為重。	第三云所知障中種．習為重。	The third says: The seeds and habits in the obstacle to that which is to be known are heavy.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a14_6']	現行名輕。	現行名輕。	The actual activity is called light.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a14_18']	由二障種．習餘現行得生。	由二障種．習餘現行得生。	Because the seeds and habits of the two obstacles give rise to the remaining actual activities.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a15_13']	若斷種．習現行永滅　要集云。	若斷種．習現行永滅　要集云。	If the seeds and habits are eliminated, the actual activities are eternally extinguished. The Essential Collection says:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a16_1']	執．障有現．種。	執．障有現．種。	The attachments and obstacles have actual activities and seeds.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a16_11']	如何習．種說名為執。	如何習．種說名為執。	How are the habits and seeds called attachments?
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a16_16']	現名餘障。	現名餘障。	The actual activities are called the remaining obstacles.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a17_12']	稍乖此文　此意執．障俱有種．現。	稍乖此文　此意執．障俱有種．現。	This is slightly contrary to this text. This means that both attachments and obstacles have seeds and actual activities.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a18_4']	不應執種．習獨得執名。	不應執種．習獨得執名。	You should not maintain that only seeds and perfuming are called attachments.🔽The actual dharmas are not called attachments but are called other hindrances.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a19_2']	現行不名執但名餘障　今謂無過。	現行不名執但名餘障　今謂無過。	Now, I say there is no error.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a19_11']	不說現行不名為執。	不說現行不名為執。	It is not said that the actual dharmas are not called attachments.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a20_6']	但是種．習重執之餘名為餘障。	但是種．習重執之餘名為餘障。	They are simply called other hindrances because they are the remainder of the heavy attachments of seeds and perfuming.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a21_2']	以其現行輕而易伏有不行時。	以其現行輕而易伏有不行時。	Because the actual dharmas are light and easy to subdue, there are times when they do not operate.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a21_11']	若論種子不妨現在。	若論種子不妨現在。	If one discusses the seeds, they certainly exist in the present.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a22_3']	若斷種子現行必無。	若斷種子現行必無。	If one eliminates the seeds, the actual dharmas must be absent.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a22_12']	故現行輕名為餘障。	故現行輕名為餘障。	Therefore, the actual dharmas are light and are called other hindrances.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a23_7']	故由有種二障具生文極相符。	故由有種二障具生文極相符。	Therefore, because the seeds exist, the two hindrances are fully produced. The text is extremely consistent.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a23_12']	何處乖反。	何處乖反。	Where is there any contradiction?
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a24_4']	西明釋云。	西明釋云。	The Ximing Monastery's explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a24_13']	安惠煩惱執狹障寬。	安惠煩惱執狹障寬。	Asvabhāva's afflictive attachments are narrow and the hindrances are broad.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a25_7']	所知障體即與法執體無寬狹。	所知障體即與法執體無寬狹。	The substance of the obstacle to that which is to be known is the same as the substance of the attachment to dharmas, with no difference in breadth.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a26_5']	今約別煩惱說故不相違　要集云。	今約別煩惱說故不相違　要集云。	Now, because it is discussed in terms of the separate afflictions, there is no contradiction. The Yaomiao says:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a26_14']	順文義者有釋為正。	順文義者有釋為正。	Those who follow the meaning of the text have an explanation that is correct.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a27_16']	此意以煩惱障別頭貪等我執斷時彼亦隨斷故。	此意以煩惱障別頭貪等我執斷時彼亦隨斷故。	This means that when the afflictive hindrances, such as greed and so forth, are eliminated, the attachment to self is also eliminated.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a28_13']	云彼障隨斷故順文義　今謂不爾。	云彼障隨斷故順文義　今謂不爾。	It is said that because the obstacles are eliminated according to the text, it accords with the meaning of the text. Now, it is said that this is not so.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a29_7']	前云由我法執二障具生。	前云由我法執二障具生。	Previously it was said that due to the grasping of self and dharmas, the two obstacles arise completely.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672a29_16']	若證二空彼障隨斷。	若證二空彼障隨斷。	If one realizes the two emptinesses, those obstacles are eliminated according to them.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b01_3']	若但煩惱。	若但煩惱。	If it is only afflictions,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b02_2']	何須云二障具生若證二空彼障隨斷。	何須云二障具生若證二空彼障隨斷。	why is it necessary to say that the two obstacles arise completely? If one realizes the two emptinesses, those obstacles are eliminated according to them.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b02_14']	即應云若證生空彼障隨斷。	即應云若證生空彼障隨斷。	It should be said that if one realizes the emptiness of beings, those obstacles are eliminated according to them.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b03_6']	又所知障障．執相似。	又所知障障．執相似。	Moreover, the obstacle to that which is to be known and the obstacle of grasping are similar.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b03_12']	何須言二重。	何須言二重。	Why is it necessary to speak of two layers?
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b04_5']	一障有重故　今又助釋。	一障有重故　今又助釋。	One obstacle has a heavy [aspect]. Now, another explanation is given.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b04_13']	安惠有障非執者。	安惠有障非執者。	Asvabhāva says that there are obstacles but not grasping.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b05_7']	如佛地論障所得果亦名為障。	如佛地論障所得果亦名為障。	As the Buddha Land Treatise says, the effect obtained by the obstacles is also called an obstacle.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b05_16']	即所知障所起三業。	即所知障所起三業。	It is the three actions that arise from the obstacle to that which is to be known,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b06_3']	并所得果。	并所得果。	as well as the effect that is obtained,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b06_9']	及見．相分。	及見．相分。	and the seen and seeing parts.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b06_18']	雖此所執亦名隨斷。	雖此所執亦名隨斷。	Although what is grasped here is also called eliminated according to them,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b07_8']	如於遍計說斷之義。	如於遍計說斷之義。	it is like speaking of the meaning of elimination in regard to the imagined.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b08_4']	又二障體。	又二障體。	Moreover, the substance of the two obstacles,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b08_9', 'ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b08_14']	佛地論云。🔽煩惱障體。	佛地論云。 煩惱障體。	the Buddha Land Treatise says:🔽The substance of the obstacle of afflictions,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b09_4']	一根本煩惱及隨煩惱。	一根本煩惱及隨煩惱。	is the fundamental afflictions and secondary afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b09_9']	二所發業。	二所發業。	Second, the karma that is produced.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b11_4']	三所得果　若此論下一百二十八根本煩惱及隨煩惱以為體性　西明云。	三所得果　若此論下一百二十八根本煩惱及隨煩惱以為體性　西明云。	Third, the fruits that are obtained. If this treatise takes the one hundred and twenty-eight fundamental afflictions and secondary afflictions as its essence, Ximing says:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b11_14']	如此二論障體不同者。	如此二論障體不同者。	Thus, the two treatises have different natures of obstacles.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b12_11']	護法就正障說根本．等流以為障體。	護法就正障說根本．等流以為障體。	According to the correct obstacles, the fundamental and the outflow are taken as the essence of the obstacles.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b14_3']	親光通據障及眷屬故障．業．果為障體性　若准此釋亦未盡理。	親光通據障及眷屬故障．業．果為障體性　若准此釋亦未盡理。	According to the obstacles and their retinue, the obstacles, karma, and fruits are taken as the essence of the obstacles. If this explanation is followed, it still does not exhaust the principle.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b14_14']	護法初出障體且據勝說。	護法初出障體且據勝說。	The first explanation of the essence of the obstacles by Hufa is based on the superior meaning.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b15_4']	非不取業及果。	非不取業及果。	It is not that he does not take karma and fruits.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b15_10']	以不說唯故。	以不說唯故。	Because it is not said to be only so.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b16_7']	又下明十障中說斷惡趣雜染愚。	又下明十障中說斷惡趣雜染愚。	Moreover, in the explanation of the ten obstacles below, it is said to eliminate the delusion of the defilements of the evil destinies.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b16_17']	云應知愚品總說為愚。	云應知愚品總說為愚。	It is said, One should know that the category of delusions is generally called delusion.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b17_8']	明知障品亦說為障。	明知障品亦說為障。	It is clear that the category of obstacles is also called obstacles.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b17_16']	又此據自性斷故。	又此據自性斷故。	Moreover, this is based on the elimination of the intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b18_7']	但說根本及隨煩惱。	但說根本及隨煩惱。	It only speaks of the fundamental and secondary afflictions.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b18_16']	佛地論等據三斷故。	佛地論等據三斷故。	The Buddha Land Treatise, etc., are based on the three eliminations.🔽If the karma that is produced and the fruits that are obtained are included,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b19_7']	若所發業并所得果。	若所發業并所得果。	If the karma that is produced and the results that are obtained,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b19_12']	故不相違。	故不相違。	Therefore, there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b20_4']	若根本．隨惑名自性斷。	若根本．隨惑名自性斷。	If the fundamental and secondary afflictions are called eliminated by nature,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b20_13']	若所發業名相應斷。	若所發業名相應斷。	if the karma they give rise to is called eliminated by association.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b21_4']	據不善業作如是說。	據不善業作如是說。	This is said based on unwholesome karma.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b21_13']	若其善業亦緣縛斷。	若其善業亦緣縛斷。	If wholesome karma is also eliminated by the bonds of conditions,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b22_4']	若所得果名離縛斷。	若所得果名離縛斷。	if the fruits obtained are called eliminated by separation from bonds.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b22_17']	由自性．相應斷顯有餘涅槃。	由自性．相應斷顯有餘涅槃。	By eliminating by nature and by association, the nirvana with remainder is revealed.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b23_13']	由緣縛斷．及不生故顯無餘涅槃。	由緣縛斷．及不生故顯無餘涅槃。	By eliminating by the bonds of conditions and by non-arising, the nirvana without remainder is revealed.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b24_7']	問言彼障隨斷者。	問言彼障隨斷者。	The question is asked, When it is said that those hindrances are eliminated according to the elimination of grasping,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b24_12']	要待執除。	要待執除。	it is necessary to wait for the removal of grasping.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b25_7']	彼非執障隨彼說斷可不如是。	彼非執障隨彼說斷可不如是。	Those hindrances that are not grasped are eliminated according to their elimination, which may not be so.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b25_16']	若不如是便違論文。	若不如是便違論文。	If it is not so, then it contradicts the treatise.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0672b26_8']	若說言爾即有二難。	若說言爾即有二難。	If it is said to be so, then there are two difficulties.

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674b26_6']	既云不知如佛境。	既云不知如佛境。	Since it is said that it does not know like the Buddha's realm,🔽it clarifies that the undefiled mind also has grasping.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674b27_7']	明無漏心亦是有執　問既許無漏復名為善。	明無漏心亦是有執　問既許無漏復名為善。	Question: Since it is allowed that the undefiled is also called good,🔽how can there be ignorance?
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674b28_1']	何有無明　答簡餘重故。	何有無明　答簡餘重故。	Answer: It is in order to distinguish the other heavy [afflictions].
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674b28_11']	如有漏樂受亦名為苦。	如有漏樂受亦名為苦。	Just as contaminated pleasant feeling is also called suffering,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674b28_16']	行苦攝故。	行苦攝故。	because it is included in the suffering of conditioned existence.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674b29_6']	如有漏善亦名不善。	如有漏善亦名不善。	Just as contaminated good [karma] is also called unwholesome,

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c01_2']	故名為善及無漏者。	故名為善及無漏者。	Therefore, it is called good and undefiled,🔽it is also in order to distinguish the heavy [afflictions].
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c02_1']	亦簡重故　二云雖通三性無漏心無。	亦簡重故　二云雖通三性無漏心無。	The second explanation is that although it is common to the three natures, the undefiled mind does not have [grasping].

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c04_13']	既簡無漏心故不說有　問豈無二分耶　答准下第九解真見道。	既簡無漏心故不說有　問豈無二分耶　答准下第九解真見道。	Answer: According to the ninth [consciousness] below, which explains the true view of the path,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c05_9']	敘異說中不立二分即安惠等。	敘異說中不立二分即安惠等。	in the narration of different explanations, it does not establish the two parts, which are An Huì and others.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c06_1']	故無漏心不許有執。	故無漏心不許有執。	Therefore, the undefiled mind is not allowed to have grasping.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c07_2']	然二十唯識云不知如佛境者據有漏說。	然二十唯識云不知如佛境者據有漏說。	However, the Twenty Verses on Consciousness Only says that not knowing like the Buddha's realm is based on the contaminated [mind].
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c07_11']	或非明了不得如佛。	或非明了不得如佛。	Or, if they are not clear, they cannot be like the Buddha.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c08_7']	相傳二解　准此唯佛不有二分。	相傳二解　准此唯佛不有二分。	According to this, only the Buddha does not have the two parts.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c08_16']	故知我法不依佛說。	故知我法不依佛說。	Therefore, we know that the self and dharmas are not based on the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c09_3']	無二分故。	無二分故。	Because there are no two parts.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c09_9']	證不可言故。	證不可言故。	Because realization cannot be expressed in words.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c09_15']	執習斷盡故。	執習斷盡故。	Because the habitual tendencies are completely severed.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c11_2']	施設我法唯在於餘　除佛已外於計所執總無之上。	施設我法唯在於餘　除佛已外於計所執總無之上。	The establishment of the self and dharmas is only in others. Except for the Buddha, on top of the total non-existence,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c11_11']	別執為我及以實法。	別執為我及以實法。	They separately grasp as the self and real dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c12_2']	世尊除此虛妄執故。	世尊除此虛妄執故。	The World-Honored One, in order to eliminate this false grasping,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c12_15']	於總無上假施設為聖教我法。	於總無上假施設為聖教我法。	On top of the total non-existence, provisionally establishes the self and dharmas of the holy teachings.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c13_7']	故經頌云如愚所分別。	故經頌云如愚所分別。	Therefore, a verse in the sutra says: As foolish people discriminate.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c13_13']	頌證餘妄執。	頌證餘妄執。	The verse proves the false grasping of others.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c14_7']	為對遺愚夫所執實我法。	為對遺愚夫所執實我法。	In order to counter the grasped real self and dharmas of the remaining foolish people,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c14_13']	頌證佛說意。	頌證佛說意。	The verse proves the meaning of the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c15_1']	世尊離執故。	世尊離執故。	Because the World-Honored One is free from grasping,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c15_8']	無相．見分故。	無相．見分故。	Because there are no characteristics and seeing parts,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c17_6']	故不依佛施設我法　若爾何故名如來等　答為對遣餘執實如來故施假號。	故不依佛施設我法　若爾何故名如來等　答為對遣餘執實如來故施假號。	Therefore, the self and dharmas are not established based on the Buddha. If that is so, why is he called the Tathāgata and so forth? The answer is: In order to eliminate the remaining grasping of the real Tathāgata, the provisional name is given.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c20_2']	如對法論說我之義　問佛無相．見誰能說耶　答准此應同無性等釋聞者識上聚集顯現佛實不說　然安惠釋。	如對法論說我之義　問佛無相．見誰能說耶　答准此應同無性等釋聞者識上聚集顯現佛實不說　然安惠釋。	As the Abhidharma-samuccaya says, the meaning of self. Question: If the Buddha has no characteristics and no seeing, who can speak? Answer: According to this, it should be the same as the explanation by Asvabhāva and others. The Buddha actually does not speak, but appears to speak in the consciousness of the listener. However, Sthiramati explains:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c20_7']	假我假法。	假我假法。	The provisional self and provisional dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c20_12']	世間愚夫。	世間愚夫。	The foolish common people in the world.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c21_4']	於自證分上妄生相．見。	於自證分上妄生相．見。	On the basis of the self-authenticating portion, falsely give rise to characteristics and seeing.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c21_10']	相．見本無。	相．見本無。	Characteristics and seeing are originally non-existent.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c21_19']	不了此空執有我法。	不了此空執有我法。	Not understanding this emptiness, they grasp at the existence of self and dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c22_12']	我法別無　或執相．見別二。	我法別無　或執相．見別二。	Self and dharmas are separately non-existent. Or they grasp characteristics and seeing as two separate things.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c23_1']	以為若我若法。	以為若我若法。	Taking them to be either self or dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c24_2']	故名別無　相．見總無為別我法作所依止。	故名別無　相．見總無為別我法作所依止。	Therefore they are said to be separately non-existent. Characteristics and seeing are totally non-existent, serving as the basis for the separate self and dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c24_12']	以此我法依相．見故。	以此我法依相．見故。	Because these self and dharmas depend on characteristics and seeing.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c24_19']	名別無依總無。	名別無依總無。	They are said to be separately non-existent, relying on the total non-existence.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c25_8']	而假立為世間我法。	而假立為世間我法。	But they are provisionally established as the self and dharmas of the world.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c26_4']	以無依無假立聖教所說我法。	以無依無假立聖教所說我法。	The self and dharmas spoken of in the holy teachings, although provisionally established without basis,
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c27_9']	雖迷．悟異俱依於無　又此安惠以外似內以無似有。	雖迷．悟異俱依於無　又此安惠以外似內以無似有。	Although deluded and enlightened are different, they both rely on the non-existent. Moreover, this Sthiramati takes the external as similar to the internal, and the non-existent as similar to the existent.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c28_3']	相．見體無似內心執有故。	相．見體無似內心執有故。	The substance of the characteristics and the seen part is not like the internal mind grasping as existing.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c28_7']	法准同。	法准同。	The dharma is the same.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c29_7']	聖教我法以有似無　若護法釋具如疏辨。	聖教我法以有似無　若護法釋具如疏辨。	The holy teachings say that the self and dharmas exist but are non-existent. If we follow the explanation of Dharmapāla, it is as explained in the commentary.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c29_12']	然疏判云。	然疏判云。	However, the commentary judges:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0674c29_17']	此上二解。	此上二解。	These above two explanations.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0675a01_2']	第一解云。	第一解云。	The first explanation says:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0675a01_12']	我．法二假乃屬於說。	我．法二假乃屬於說。	The two provisional selves and dharmas belong to the spoken.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0675a02_2']	唯假言說以為我法。	唯假言說以為我法。	Only the provisional words are taken as the self and dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0675a02_13']	彼體都非者　此意釋云。	彼體都非者　此意釋云。	Their substance is completely non-existent. This meaning explains:
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0675a03_7']	世間我法說所執相以為我法。	世間我法說所執相以為我法。	The worldly self and dharmas take the grasped characteristics as the self and dharmas.

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0677c23_1']	如眼等根第八所變是因緣故實有根用。	如眼等根第八所變是因緣故實有根用。	then like the eye faculty, etc., the transformation of the eighth consciousness is a condition as cause, and therefore has the real function of the faculties.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0677c23_10']	若起相分因第六生。	若起相分因第六生。	If the image is born from the sixth consciousness as a condition,

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0677c24_10']	以第六見為緣起故。	以第六見為緣起故。	because the seeing part of the sixth consciousness is the condition for its arising,

['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0677c25_14']	非無體假故無假實同一種失。	非無體假故無假實同一種失。	It is not without substance, and therefore there is no error of the real and the conceptual being born from the same seeds.
['ZH_T43_1832_01b:0677c28_5']	然同別種　復有種別性與見同　或復性同而繫．種別　或復相分性隨見質判性不定　或雖有質。	然同別種　復有種別性與見同　或復性同而繫．種別　或復相分性隨見質判性不定　或雖有質。	However, there are distinctions in seeds. The nature may be the same as the view, or the nature may be the same while the seeds are distinguished.
