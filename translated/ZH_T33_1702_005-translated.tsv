In wisdom, there are two meanings. The sun can dispel darkness, like wisdom cutting off delusions. The eyes can see emptiness, like wisdom realizing truth.

For example, space is all-pervading. All forms also fill the world. Hundreds of thousands and millions of people are all within it. Before the sun rises, the six directions are dark. Although in space, one does not see space. Although facing forms, one does not see forms.

['ZH_T33_1702_005:0214a22_7']	法中亦爾，謂真如之理周遍十方，性上功德亦遍一切，眾生無量悉在其中，以智慧未生唯是癡暗，雖在真內何曾見真，雖有性德不見性德。	法中亦爾，謂真如之理周遍十方，性上功德亦遍一切，眾生無量悉在其中，以智慧未生唯是癡暗，雖在真內何曾見真，雖有性德不見性德。	It is the same in the Dharma. It is said that the principle of suchness pervades the ten directions, and the virtues on the nature also pervade everything. The immeasurable sentient beings are all within it. Due to the non-arising of wisdom, there is only delusion and darkness. Although they are within suchness, how have they ever seen suchness? Although there are the virtues of the nature, they do not see the virtues of the nature.
['ZH_T33_1702_005:0214a24_12']	苟或智慧明發惑暗盡除，真性廓周自然明見，匪但性無邊際身在性中，反思迷暗之時不曾暫離。	苟或智慧明發惑暗盡除，真性廓周自然明見，匪但性無邊際身在性中，反思迷暗之時不曾暫離。	If wisdom shines forth and deluded darkness is completely dispelled, the true nature is vast and all-pervading, and one naturally sees clearly. It is not only that the nature has no boundaries and the body is within the nature, but also that when reflecting on the time of delusion and darkness, one has never left it for a moment.

Therefore, the sun is the antidote, and darkness is what is to be eliminated. When the darkness that is to be eliminated is exhausted, the sunlight that is the antidote appears, and one can then see forms and so forth.
