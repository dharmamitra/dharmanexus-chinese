The second explanation says: Or one should admit that one cultivates while being free from the path of liberation. The third explanation says: Or one should admit that when severing defilements, one cultivates the upper [stages] based on the lower [stages]. The above discusses the path of cultivation, not the path of seeing.
['ZH_T41_1822_026:0776a03_14']	見道現起亦修下俗智故。	見道現起亦修下俗智故。	026	Because when the path of seeing is presently active, one also cultivates the worldly cognition of the lower [stages].
