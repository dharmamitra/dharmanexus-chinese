['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b20_4']	此則由緣生故。	此則由緣生故。	This is because of dependent arising.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b20_10']	即顯無性也。	即顯無性也。	It thereby reveals the absence of intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b20_14']	中論云。	中論云。	The Madhyamaka Treatise states:
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b21_2']	以有空義故。	以有空義故。	Because of the principle of emptiness,
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b21_9']	一切法得成者。	一切法得成者。	all dharmas can be established.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b22_4']	此則由無性故即明緣生也。	此則由無性故即明緣生也。	This is because of the absence of intrinsic nature, it clarifies dependent arising.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b22_9']	涅槃經云。	涅槃經云。	The Nirvana Sutra states:
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b22_14']	因緣故有。	因緣故有。	Because of causes and conditions, there is existence.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b22_19']	無性故空。	無性故空。	Because of the absence of intrinsic nature, there is emptiness.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b23_7']	此則無性即因緣。	此則無性即因緣。	This is because the absence of intrinsic nature is itself causes and conditions,
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b23_13']	因緣即無性。	因緣即無性。	and causes and conditions are themselves the absence of intrinsic nature.

['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b25_5']	亦乃全體相收畢竟無二也。	亦乃全體相收畢竟無二也。	they also completely encompass each other, ultimately non-dual.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b25_10']	所執性中。	所執性中。	Within the nature of grasping,
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b26_1']	雖復當情稱執現有。	雖復當情稱執現有。	even though it is called grasping and appears to exist from one's perspective,
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b26_10']	然於道理畢竟是無。	然於道理畢竟是無。	it is ultimately non-existent in terms of principle.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b27_2']	以於無處橫計有故。	以於無處橫計有故。	Because existence is falsely grasped where there is non-existence.

['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b29_4']	即不得名橫計有鬼。	即不得名橫計有鬼。	then one could not say it is mistakenly thought to exist.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499b29_13']	以於木有非由計故。	以於木有非由計故。	Because it exists in the stump, not due to thought.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499c01_1']	今既橫計。	今既橫計。	Now, since it is mistakenly thought,
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499c01_6']	明知理無。	明知理無。	it is clear that it does not exist in principle.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499c01_15']	由理無故得成橫計。	由理無故得成橫計。	Because it does not exist in principle, it can be established as a mistaken thought.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499c02_6']	成橫計故方知理無。	成橫計故方知理無。	Because it is established as a mistaken thought, one then knows it does not exist in principle.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499c02_15']	是故無二唯一性也。	是故無二唯一性也。	Therefore, there are not two, but only one nature.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0499c03_5']	當知所執道理亦爾。	當知所執道理亦爾。	One should know that the principle of what is grasped is also like this.

['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b06_13']	是非有也。	是非有也。	This is existence.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b07_2']	問真如是不生滅法。	問真如是不生滅法。	Question: True suchness is the dharma of non-arising and non-ceasing.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b07_14']	既不異無常之常故說為常。	既不異無常之常故說為常。	Since it is not different from the eternal that is not different from the impermanent, it is said to be eternal.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b08_4']	不異常之無常故。	不異常之無常故。	Because it is not different from the usual impermanence.

['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b11_5']	以諸緣起無常之法。	以諸緣起無常之法。	Because the dharmas of impermanence in dependent origination

['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b12_7']	是故不異常性而得無常。	是故不異常性而得無常。	Therefore, it is not different from the nature of impermanence and yet can attain impermanence.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b12_11']	故經云。	故經云。	Thus, a sutra says:
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b13_2']	不生不滅是無常義。	不生不滅是無常義。	Non-arising and non-ceasing is the meaning of impermanence.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b13_13']	此則不異於常成無常也。	此則不異於常成無常也。	This means that it is not different from permanence and yet forms impermanence.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b14_6']	又以諸緣起即無自性。	又以諸緣起即無自性。	Moreover, because dependent origination is precisely without self-nature,
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b14_15']	非滅緣起方說無性。	非滅緣起方說無性。	it is not that dependent origination ceases and only then is said to be without self-nature.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b15_8']	是則不異無常之常也。	是則不異無常之常也。	This means that it is not different from impermanence and yet is permanence.

['ZH_T45_1866_004:0500b20_9']	是故若執真如同情所謂而凝然常者。	是故若執真如同情所謂而凝然常者。	Therefore, if one grasps the true as the same as the conventional, as something that is eternally still,

['ZH_T45_1866_004:0508c10_3']	本以緣成舍名為椽。	本以緣成舍名為椽。	Originally, because the house is made by conditions, it is called a rafter.
['ZH_T45_1866_004:0508c10_14']	今既不作舍故無椽是斷。	今既不作舍故無椽是斷。	Now, since the house is not made, there is no rafter, so this is annihilation.
