Then conditioned dharmas would be permanent, refuting by applying the principle.

On the side of conditioned dharmas there would be no arising. Without arising and change, it should be permanent. However, conditioned dharmas are by nature impermanent, always having the characteristic of arising that follows and changes. It is clear that the characteristic of arising is not impermanent.

The first character sheng (arising) cites and raises the characteristic of arising. The next phrase sheng (arising) clarifies that the prior characteristic of arising is able to give rise to all dharmas. The phrase because of arising shows that those dharmas only begin to arise due to the arising of the characteristic.

This is a summary of the fourth question. It says non-arising is called nirvana to distinguish the previous non-arising as nirvana, which is eternally quiescent, so it is called non-arising.
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0790a20_13']	「涅槃不生故不可說」釋後不生不可說也。	「涅槃不生故不可說」釋後不生不可說也。	Because nirvana does not arise, it is unspeakable explains the latter non-arising as unspeakable.

From the meaning of attaining through cultivation and realization, it is said to be arising, not that there is arising of what is nonexistent. Here, it does not wish to clarify the arising of nirvana. Taking the unarisen dharma of nirvana as having the meaning of what can arise, it illustrates that the unarisen dharmas of the world have the meaning of arising.

Because arising is nonexistent means the characteristic of arising is impermanent. Once it ceases, it does not come again, thus it is said to be nonexistent. Therefore, it cannot be definitively spoken of as arising.

Because there is always the attainment of the one who attains, the characteristic of arising can be attained. Therefore, it cannot be definitively spoken of as non-arising.

The desire realm has no concentration, so the divine eye does not arise. How can it now be said that if based on the four great elements of the desire realm, the eye faculty cannot see the first dhyāna?
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0803b29_14']	釋言：	釋言：	The explanation says:
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0803c04_2']	此義論者不同，若依《毘曇》，身在欲界修天眼者，依於上禪發得上地清淨四大所造眼根，與欲界眼同在一處，用之遠見，一向不用欲果之眼而見遠色。	此義論者不同，若依《毘曇》，身在欲界修天眼者，依於上禪發得上地清淨四大所造眼根，與欲界眼同在一處，用之遠見，一向不用欲果之眼而見遠色。	The meaning of this is not the same for the various treatises. If, according to the Abhidharma, one in the desire realm cultivates the divine eye, based on the upper dhyānas one attains the pure four great elements of the upper realms, which form the eye faculty, and together with the eye of the desire realm they are in the same place. Using it to see far away, one does not use the eye of the desire realm to see distant colors.

It does not say that the divine eye faculty is separately produced in the dhyānas above and sees far in one place with the eyes of the lower realms, like a person taking medicine to make the eyes bright and pure. It is the same as that. It is also the same as when cultivating the divine eye in the desire realm up to the third dhyāna.
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0803c12_10']	此經所說多同《毘曇》，欲界地中實無依禪所生天眼，非無欲界有報天眼，六欲諸天亦有修道得羅漢，故今通說之，故言欲界四大眼根不見初禪。	此經所說多同《毘曇》，欲界地中實無依禪所生天眼，非無欲界有報天眼，六欲諸天亦有修道得羅漢，故今通說之，故言欲界四大眼根不見初禪。	The explanations in this sūtra are mostly the same as the Abhidharma. In the realm of desire, there is indeed no divine eye produced by relying on the dhyānas. It is not that there is no retribution divine eye in the desire realm. The gods of the six desires also cultivate the path and attain arhatship. Therefore, it is now explained in a general way, saying that the eye faculty of the four elements in the desire realm does not see the first dhyāna.

If it is a non-existent object, it is called empty space refers to the non-existent dharma seen by the wisdom eye, which is explained as emptiness. This refers to the originally self-natureless non-existent dharma as empty space, not an existent object removed to make it empty. Such empty space is called real distinguishes the true from the false, unlike deluded emotions that destroy dharmas to make them empty, thus it is called real.
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0809c22_2']	「以是實故名常無」者，明空非始，本來常寂，不同對治，破有始空，故曰常無。	「以是實故名常無」者，明空非始，本來常寂，不同對治，破有始空，故曰常無。	Because it is real, it is called permanent non-existence clarifies that emptiness is not a beginning, originally always quiescent, unlike the antidotes that destroy existence to make beginningless emptiness, thus it is called permanent non-existence.

Therefore, it says non-existent. Moreover, it is also unlike the self, joy, and purity grasped by false thoughts. Therefore, it is said to be non-existent, but it is not without principle and purity.🔽In the second analogy, emptiness is called non-existent, and non-existent is called emptiness summarizes the previous explanation of the principle. For example, in the world, the absence of things is called emptiness uses an analogy to illustrate. The nature of the world's great void is originally devoid of things, similar to the principle of emptiness in the Dharma. Therefore, it uses an analogy. The nature of space is also like this and so forth explains how the Dharma is the same as the analogy.

['ZH_T37_1764_007:0811c27_11']	何故菩薩斷結不名不生，諸佛斷處偏名不生？	何故菩薩斷結不名不生，諸佛斷處偏名不生？	Why is it that bodhisattvas' elimination of bonds is not called non-arising, while the Buddhas' elimination is exclusively called non-arising?
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0811c27_16']	釋有三義：	釋有三義：	There are three meanings in the explanation:
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0811c29_6']	一就惑分別，菩薩雖復隨分斷結，斷之不盡，心中更起，故非不生；	一就惑分別，菩薩雖復隨分斷結，斷之不盡，心中更起，故非不生；	First, from the perspective of afflictions, although bodhisattvas have partially eliminated bonds, their elimination is not complete, and they still arise in the mind, so it is not called non-arising;

You should know that the two principles of the greedy mind are different, so it exists again. How can it defile the mind? The Dharma explanation is not defiled.
['ZH_T37_1764_007:0813c03_8']	貪妄心真，真妄兩別，故言各異。	貪妄心真，真妄兩別，故言各異。	The true mind of greed is false, and truth and falsity are two different things, so it says they are different.

There are no thorns in space, so they cannot be pulled out. The mind is without greed, so how can liberation be distinguished?
