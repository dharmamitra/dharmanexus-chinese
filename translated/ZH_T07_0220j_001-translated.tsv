Therefore, the Śrāvastī assembly was convened again, and the teaching of dāna was initiated. It is intended to make the three firmnesses lose their guard and the ten pāramitās become a ford. One should then tread the path of cultivation for four vows and push open the secret key of the seven kinds of emptiness. One should crush the two vehicles and go straight up, destroy the three wheels and gallop far away.
['ZH_T07_0220j_001:0991b23_8']	糺以唯識，何國城之可依？	糺以唯識，何國城之可依？	If we examine it with vijñaptimātratā, what country or city can be relied upon?

['ZH_T07_0220j_001:0991b26_18']	權之以方便，則不念而自融矣。	權之以方便，則不念而自融矣。	If one directs it with skillful means, it will be fused without being contemplated.
['ZH_T07_0220j_001:0991b27_14']	故不患物之少也，患夫用心之不弘；	故不患物之少也，患夫用心之不弘；	Therefore, one should not worry about the scarcity of things, but about the lack of magnanimity in one's mind;
['ZH_T07_0220j_001:0991b28_10']	不患施之難也，患夫忘取之不易。	不患施之難也，患夫忘取之不易。	One should not worry about the difficulty of giving, but about the difficulty of forgetting one's gains.

['ZH_T07_0220j_001:0991b29_18']	趣寂以為真，是未會其寂矣。	趣寂以為真，是未會其寂矣。	If one seeks tranquility as the truth, this is not yet the ultimate tranquility.
['ZH_T07_0220j_001:0991c02_4']	又況名譽福樂之求，王賊水火之慮，其於致極，不亦彌遠。	又況名譽福樂之求，王賊水火之慮，其於致極，不亦彌遠。	Moreover, seeking fame, reputation, blessings, and happiness, and worrying about kings, thieves, water, and fire, how could these lead to the ultimate, wouldn't they be even further away?
['ZH_T07_0220j_001:0991c03_9']	然則大覺之士弘願所歸，其財施也，畢生品以充足；	然則大覺之士弘願所歸，其財施也，畢生品以充足；	However, for those of great enlightenment, the return of their vast vows, in terms of material giving, is to fulfill all with their life's wealth;

Even if it is as unshakable as Mount Lu and as difficult to borrow as a merchant's goods, I still hope that the compassionate sound will gradually permeate and change the stinginess. From this point on, who can remain unchanged?
