Therefore, bodhisattvas, by the power of benefiting sentient beings, always vow to experience and practice the dharmas of saṃsāra. This is called the second non-distinctive dharma.
['ZH_T31_1602_008:0517c26_7']	又諸菩薩雖善了知默然樂味，而樂令有情畢竟清淨即為己樂，是故菩薩為淨有情增上力故，恒勤方便而為說法，是名第三非殊特法。	又諸菩薩雖善了知默然樂味，而樂令有情畢竟清淨即為己樂，是故菩薩為淨有情增上力故，恒勤方便而為說法，是名第三非殊特法。	008	Moreover, although bodhisattvas understand the taste of silence, they take delight in the ultimate purity of sentient beings as their own delight. Therefore, bodhisattvas always diligently apply themselves to expounding the Dharma for the sake of the power of purifying sentient beings. This is called the third extraordinary dharma.
['ZH_T31_1602_008:0518a01_3']	又諸菩薩雖已積集六波羅蜜多善根，而樂令有情畢竟清淨即為己樂，是故菩薩為淨有情增上力故，以清淨意而施與之，又不期彼施果異熟，是名第四非殊特法。	又諸菩薩雖已積集六波羅蜜多善根，而樂令有情畢竟清淨即為己樂，是故菩薩為淨有情增上力故，以清淨意而施與之，又不期彼施果異熟，是名第四非殊特法。	008	Moreover, although bodhisattvas have already accumulated the wholesome roots of the six perfections, they take delight in the ultimate purity of sentient beings as their own delight. Therefore, bodhisattvas, for the sake of the power of purifying sentient beings, give with a pure mind and do not expect the ripening of the fruits of that giving. This is called the fourth extraordinary dharma.
