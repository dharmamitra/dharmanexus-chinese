Furthermore, the first chapter has already explained that the essence of all dharmas is without arising, and has refuted [the opponent's] arguments, causing people to understand and believe.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c09_4']	今復次明不來不去緣起差別，使物識知，遮彼義故。	今復次明不來不去緣起差別，使物識知，遮彼義故。	Now, it is further explained that dependent arising is without coming and going, distinguishing [the correct view] from [the opponent's] view, in order to make people recognize and understand, and to refute [the opponent's] meaning.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c09_14']	第二品起，此義云何？	第二品起，此義云何？	Why does the second chapter arise?
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c10_12']	世間法中言說自在，於所作事深起愛染。	世間法中言說自在，於所作事深起愛染。	In worldly dharmas, speech is sovereign, and one deeply gives rise to attachment to what is done.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c11_16']	今欲拔彼執著箭故，遮一行相，此外施為即易可破。	今欲拔彼執著箭故，遮一行相，此外施為即易可破。	Now, in order to pull out the arrow of attachment, one refutes one aspect of practice. This external activity is then easily refuted.

['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c13_8']	彼境界差別可言說故。	彼境界差別可言說故。	Because their objects can be distinguished and spoken of.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c14_5']	若無此起彼境界差別，則不可言說。	若無此起彼境界差別，則不可言說。	If there is no arising of this, then the distinction of objects cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c15_14']	如石女兒不可說彼有來有去，若提婆達多、耶若達多則不如是。	如石女兒不可說彼有來有去，若提婆達多、耶若達多則不如是。	Like the daughter of a barren woman, one cannot say that she comes or goes. If it is Devadatta or Yajñadatta, it is not like this.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c16_8']	由此譬喻，自他諸法起義得成。	由此譬喻，自他諸法起義得成。	By this analogy, the meaning of the arising of one's own and others' dharmas is established.

['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c20_8']	如在定者以慧眼觀，彼施戒等行及不行，第一義中體不可得，彼境界差別可言說，因義不成故。	如在定者以慧眼觀，彼施戒等行及不行，第一義中體不可得，彼境界差別可言說，因義不成故。	Like one in concentration observing with the eye of wisdom, those giving, morality, etc., in action and non-action, their essence cannot be attained in the ultimate truth, and the distinction of their objects can be spoken of. Because the meaning of the cause is not established.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c20_18']	如遮行起，行亦同破。	如遮行起，行亦同破。	Like the cessation of action, action is also refuted in the same way.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c22_2']	復次若謂我立因種，共汝同解分別俱成者，此義不然。	復次若謂我立因種，共汝同解分別俱成者，此義不然。	Furthermore, if one says that I establish the cause and seed, and that discrimination is accomplished together with you, this meaning is not so.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c22_6']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c22_16']	彼俱成因，驗無體故。	彼俱成因，驗無體故。	Because the cause of that accomplishment is examined and found to be without substance.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0059c23_7']	如是異執，有驗違彼因義故。	如是異執，有驗違彼因義故。	Such different views are verified and contradict the meaning of that reason.

['ZH_T30_1566_003:0060a17_10']	但有處邊剎那剎那前後差別，名為和合。	但有處邊剎那剎那前後差別，名為和合。	There is only the difference between the edge of a place and the previous and later moments, called combination.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0060a18_13']	調達名者唯是行聚，自既無體，何有別去與彼合耶？	調達名者唯是行聚，自既無體，何有別去與彼合耶？	The name Devadatta is only a collection of activities, since it itself has no substance, how can there be a separate going that combines with it?

['ZH_T30_1566_003:0060a29_12']	焰等去迷，智同迷故，彼去者去異，亦欲遮故。	焰等去迷，智同迷故，彼去者去異，亦欲遮故。	Because the delusion of going in a flame is the same as the delusion of knowledge. The difference between the goer and going is also to be refuted.
['ZH_T30_1566_003:0060b01_6']	又世間智人，於汝所執不歡喜故。	又世間智人，於汝所執不歡喜故。	Moreover, worldly wise people do not rejoice in your assertion.
