['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a15_1']	不生不滅，汎解有四：	不生不滅，汎解有四：	03b	Non-birth and non-extinction are generally explained in four ways:
['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a16_6']	一、生死染法虛集無性，以無性故，生無所生、滅無所滅。	一、生死染法虛集無性，以無性故，生無所生、滅無所滅。	03b	First, the defiled dharmas of birth and death are falsely accumulated without nature. Because of their naturelessness, arising does not give rise to anything, and ceasing does not cease anything.
['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a17_19']	二、生死染法妄相而有，妄體空相則無相，以無相故，生無所生、滅無所滅。	二、生死染法妄相而有，妄體空相則無相，以無相故，生無所生、滅無所滅。	03b	Second, the defiled dharmas of birth and death exist as false appearances. The false essence is empty and without characteristics. Because of their characteristiclessness, arising does not give rise to anything, and ceasing does not cease anything.
['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a20_2']	三、生死染法妄想而有，如夢所見心外無法，妄想情有道理實無，以實無故，生無所生、滅無所滅。	三、生死染法妄想而有，如夢所見心外無法，妄想情有道理實無，以實無故，生無所生、滅無所滅。	03b	Third, the defiled dharmas of birth and death exist as false thoughts. Like what is seen in a dream, there are no external dharmas. False thoughts exist emotionally but are actually nonexistent. Because of their actuality, arising does not give rise to anything, and ceasing does not cease anything.
['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a21_12']	四、生死染法如來藏起，窮之即實，實性平等，生則無生、滅則無滅。	四、生死染法如來藏起，窮之即實，實性平等，生則無生、滅則無滅。	03b	Fourth, the defiled dharmas of birth and death arise from the Tathāgatagarbha. Pursuing it is the truth. The nature of truth is equal. Arising is non-arising, and ceasing is non-ceasing.
['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a22_15']	以是義故，本無所生、今無所滅，不生不滅故曰不二。	以是義故，本無所生、今無所滅，不生不滅故曰不二。	03b	For this reason, originally there is nothing to arise, and now there is nothing to cease. Because of non-arising and non-ceasing, it is called non-dual.
['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a23_4']	「得此不生」，解釋入義。	「得此不生」，解釋入義。	03b	Attaining this non-arising explains the entry into the meaning.
['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493a25_2']	於前無生無滅法中，慧心安住名無生忍，從緣亦應名無滅忍，初約彰名偏言無生。	於前無生無滅法中，慧心安住名無生忍，從緣亦應名無滅忍，初約彰名偏言無生。	03b	In the previously unborn and unceasing dharmas, the mind of wisdom peacefully abides, called the acceptance of non-birth. From conditions, it should also be called the acceptance of non-extinction. Initially, it is named after the manifestation, unilaterally called non-birth.

['ZH_T38_1776_03b:0493b01_9']	二、五陰集成假名眾生名之為我，五陰是其我家所有名為我所。	二、五陰集成假名眾生名之為我，五陰是其我家所有名為我所。	03b	Second, the provisional name of sentient beings formed by the five aggregates is called self, and the five aggregates that belong to my house are called what belongs to self.

Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, One who knows the self and mine is a person who has transcended the world.
