['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b05_11']	今疏借用，乃通三義：	今疏借用，乃通三義：	Now the commentary borrows and uses this to convey three meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b06_12']	一約教，始隨機異故殊途，終歸顯實故一致；	一約教，始隨機異故殊途，終歸顯實故一致；	First, in terms of teachings, it begins by following different capacities, so the paths are different, but in the end it returns to revealing the truth, so they converge into one.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b07_4']	二約機則異，就理常一；	二約機則異，就理常一；	Second, in terms of capacities, they are different, but in terms of principle they are always one.

['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b10_10']	疏「二、一音普應一雨普滋」者，一音即是《淨名》，一雨即《法華．藥草喻品》，謂三草二木不同，同承一雨之潤；	疏「二、一音普應一雨普滋」者，一音即是《淨名》，一雨即《法華．藥草喻品》，謂三草二木不同，同承一雨之潤；	The commentary states second, the universal response of the one sound and the universal nourishment of the one rain refers to the one sound of the Vimalakirti Sutra and the one rain of the Dharma Flower Sutra's chapter on the Parable of the Herbs.

['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b14_13']	疏「三、原聖本意為一事故」者，亦是《法華》中意。	疏「三、原聖本意為一事故」者，亦是《法華》中意。	The third reason, The original intention of the sages is for one purpose, is also the meaning in the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b16_15']	故彼經云「過去諸佛以無量無數方便，種種因緣譬喻言詞，而為眾生演說諸法，是法皆為一佛乘故。	故彼經云「過去諸佛以無量無數方便，種種因緣譬喻言詞，而為眾生演說諸法，是法皆為一佛乘故。	Therefore that sūtra says, The buddhas of the past used immeasurable and countless skillful means, various causes, conditions, parables, and verbal expressions to expound the Dharma for sentient beings. All these teachings are for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b17_8']	」一佛乘者，即華嚴矣。	」一佛乘者，即華嚴矣。	 The One Buddha Vehicle is precisely the Flower Ornament Sutra.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b18_15']	又云「我此九部法，隨順眾生說，入大乘為本，以故說是經。	又云「我此九部法，隨順眾生說，入大乘為本，以故說是經。	It also says, I have expounded the nine divisions of the Dharma in accordance with the capacities of sentient beings. The fundamental purpose is to enter the Great Vehicle, and therefore I expound this sūtra.

['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b21_6']	如經說一無常，或有解者以生滅代謝故云無常；	如經說一無常，或有解者以生滅代謝故云無常；	As the sutra says one is impermanent, some understand it as impermanent because of the arising and ceasing of change;
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b21_17']	或云無彼常故名為無常；	或云無彼常故名為無常；	some say it is called impermanent because it lacks permanence;
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b22_10']	或云不生不滅名為無常；	或云不生不滅名為無常；	some say non-arising and non-ceasing is called impermanent;
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b23_1']	或即無法可常也；	或即無法可常也；	some say there is simply no dharma that is permanent;
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b24_3']	或云真如一法隨染淨緣轉變不常故名無常。	或云真如一法隨染淨緣轉變不常故名無常。	some say the one dharma of suchness, following defiled and pure conditions, transforms and is not permanent, thus it is called impermanent.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b25_11']	或聞無常，便知對常以說無常，非常非無常，以為中道等。	或聞無常，便知對常以說無常，非常非無常，以為中道等。	Or hearing impermanent, one immediately knows that it is said in contrast to permanence, and that neither permanence nor impermanence is taken as the middle way, and so on.

['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b27_3']	又苦集滅道四名則同，隨機解殊，乃有四種。	又苦集滅道四名則同，隨機解殊，乃有四種。	Moreover, the four names of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and path are the same, but understanding varies according to the individual, resulting in four kinds.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039b29_16']	又《涅槃》云「十二因緣，下智觀者得聲聞菩提，中智觀者得緣覺菩提，上智觀者得菩薩菩提，上上智觀者得佛菩提。	又《涅槃》云「十二因緣，下智觀者得聲聞菩提，中智觀者得緣覺菩提，上智觀者得菩薩菩提，上上智觀者得佛菩提。	Furthermore, the Nirvana Sutra says, Those who contemplate the twelve links of dependent arising with lower wisdom attain the enlightenment of śrāvakas, those who contemplate with middling wisdom attain the enlightenment of pratyekabuddhas, those who contemplate with superior wisdom attain the enlightenment of bodhisattvas, and those who contemplate with the highest wisdom attain the enlightenment of Buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039c01_15']	」又如一乘，五教機解不同，三諦差別。	」又如一乘，五教機解不同，三諦差別。	Also, like the One Vehicle, the understanding of the five teachings is not the same, and the three truths are distinguished.
['ZH_T36_1736_006:0039c03_5']	《中論》偈云「因緣所生法，我說即是空，亦名為假名，亦是中道義。	《中論》偈云「因緣所生法，我說即是空，亦名為假名，亦是中道義。	A verse from the Madhyamaka-śāstra says: The dharmas produced by causes and conditions, I say are precisely emptiness, are also called provisional names, and are also the meaning of the middle way.

Regressing, they are not the same as the Hīnayāna analysis of dharmas, and advancing, they are not the same as the Distinct and Perfect teachings.
