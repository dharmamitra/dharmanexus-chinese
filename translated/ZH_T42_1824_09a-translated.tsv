['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b11_10']	以破有竟外則執無是故破無。	以破有竟外則執無是故破無。	After refuting existence, others will cling to non-existence, so non-existence is refuted.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b12_2']	次破無竟外迴宗執有。	次破無竟外迴宗執有。	After refuting non-existence, others will revert to clinging to existence.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b12_7']	故重破有。	故重破有。	Therefore, existence is refuted again.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b12_16']	破其有竟從徹捉無。	破其有竟從徹捉無。	After refuting existence, non-existence is penetrated and grasped.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b25_5']	二者假緣則生。	二者假緣則生。	Second, if conditions are assumed, it arises.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b25_11']	故知緣中有。	故知緣中有。	Therefore, it is known that there is in the conditions.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b26_1']	緣中若無雖合不生。	緣中若無雖合不生。	If there were no in the conditions, it would not arise even if combined.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132b29_12']	答因中無事果終是因中無果義。	答因中無事果終是因中無果義。	The answer is: In the cause, there is no effect. This is the meaning of there being no effect in the cause.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c01_4']	以因中無事而生於事。	以因中無事而生於事。	Because there is no event in the cause, an event arises.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c01_13']	當知此事本無今有。	當知此事本無今有。	One should know that this event was originally non-existent but now exists.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c02_1']	故是因中無果。	故是因中無果。	Therefore, it is the absence of effect in the cause.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c02_15']	又若緣合發事亦應和合方有理。	又若緣合發事亦應和合方有理。	Moreover, if events arise from the combination of conditions, then there should be a principle in the combination.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c03_5']	理若自有事亦應然。	理若自有事亦應然。	If the principle itself has an event, then events should also be so.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c03_18']	又若事因於理理應更有所因。	又若事因於理理應更有所因。	Moreover, if events are caused by the principle, then the principle should have another cause.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c05_10']	為本有竟須緣合。	為本有竟須緣合。	Is it that which originally exists needs the combination of conditions?
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c05_18']	為緣合竟然後有。	為緣合竟然後有。	Or is it that which is combined by conditions and then exists?
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c06_7']	若本有竟何須緣合。	若本有竟何須緣合。	If it originally exists, why need the combination of conditions?
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c07_2']	若緣合竟方有則未合便是無。	若緣合竟方有則未合便是無。	If it exists only after the combination of conditions, then before the combination it would be non-existent.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c07_11']	雖假緣合果終不生。	雖假緣合果終不生。	Even if it borrows the combination of conditions, the effect will never arise.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c08_2']	問曰下立因中無果義。	問曰下立因中無果義。	The question below establishes the meaning of the absence of effect in the cause.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0132c08_13']	蓋是衛世僧祇二世無義。	蓋是衛世僧祇二世無義。	This is the meaning of the two schools of Vātsīputrīya and Saṃgīti that there is no meaning in the two times.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0136b29_15']	合法不離異者此縱其別成。	合法不離異者此縱其別成。	Combining the dharma does not depart from difference. This concedes their separate formation.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0136c01_9']	而兩物共合則雖合而猶異。	而兩物共合則雖合而猶異。	But the combination of the two entities is such that although combined, they are still different.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0136c04_16']	誰為壞因。	誰為壞因。	Who would be the cause of destruction?
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0136c05_1']	故云無因。	故云無因。	Therefore it is said to have no cause.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0136c05_10']	故異則有因而不合。	故異則有因而不合。	Therefore, difference has a cause but does not come together.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0136c05_18']	不異則合而無因。	不異則合而無因。	Non-difference comes together but has no cause.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a09_9']	若見三有生滅則不能滅於三有。	若見三有生滅則不能滅於三有。	If one sees the arising and ceasing of the three existences, one will not be able to eliminate the three existences.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a10_3']	悟三有本自不生今亦不滅。	悟三有本自不生今亦不滅。	Only by realizing that the three existences are originally unborn and now also unceasing

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a19_18']	初有若滅後有無因。	初有若滅後有無因。	If the first existence ceases, the later existence has no cause.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a20_10']	下半初有不滅則一時有二。	下半初有不滅則一時有二。	The second half says if the first existence does not cease, then there are two existences at one time.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a21_1']	初有若滅滅則是無。	初有若滅滅則是無。	If the first existence ceases, cessation is then non-existence.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a24_1']	破意云。	破意云。	The meaning of the refutation is this:
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a24_18']	若初有滅時是後有生時者則二有一時。	若初有滅時是後有生時者則二有一時。	If the time when the initial existence ceases is the time when the subsequent existence arises, then the two existences are simultaneous.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a25_10']	汝言滅時生則生滅同時。	汝言滅時生則生滅同時。	You say that when it ceases, it arises, so arising and ceasing are simultaneous.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a26_4']	生有非死有是則一時有二。	生有非死有是則一時有二。	The arising existence is not the dying existence, so it is two at the same time.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a27_3']	若一時無二有則一滅一生非滅時生也。	若一時無二有則一滅一生非滅時生也。	If there are not two existences at the same time, then one ceases and one arises, not that it arises when it ceases.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a29_5']	以答不出前後一時故但云眼見。	以答不出前後一時故但云眼見。	Since the answer does not come out before or after, it just says we see with our eyes.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139a29_17']	眼見者此人若死彼處即生。	眼見者此人若死彼處即生。	We see with our eyes means that when this person dies, they are immediately reborn in that place.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b02_8']	汝欲令滅時無二有者則生死是一有。	汝欲令滅時無二有者則生死是一有。	If you want to make the two existences cease at the time of death, then birth and death are one existence.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b02_17']	是為一陰亦生亦死。	是為一陰亦生亦死。	This is one aggregate that both arises and dies.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b03_8']	若死非即生還有二有。	若死非即生還有二有。	If death is not immediately followed by birth, there are still two existences.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b03_17']	一時中有生死二陰。	一時中有生死二陰。	At one time, there are two aggregates of birth and death in the intermediate state.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b04_5']	此死陰有生陰。	此死陰有生陰。	This aggregate of death has the aggregate of birth.

['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b04_18']	上半牒前破門。	上半牒前破門。	The first half cites the previous refutation.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b05_8']	從欲生色則欲前色後。	從欲生色則欲前色後。	From desire giving rise to form, desire comes before form.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b05_13']	無色亦爾。	無色亦爾。	The formless realm is also like this.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b06_1']	下半呵外計有。	下半呵外計有。	The second half criticizes the externalist's view of existence.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b06_14']	以外人無有計有故三有不斷。	以外人無有計有故三有不斷。	Because the externalists have no view of existence, the three existences are not cut off.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b07_6']	若悟有非有故能滅三有。	若悟有非有故能滅三有。	If one realizes that existence is not existent, then one can extinguish the three existences.
['ZH_T42_1824_09a:0139b07_16']	即顯論主破三有意也。	即顯論主破三有意也。	This shows that the author of the treatise has the intention to refute the three existences.
