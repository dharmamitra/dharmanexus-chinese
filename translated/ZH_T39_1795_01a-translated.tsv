Suitable capacities for whom it is directed, 6. Essence of the expounding, 7. General and specific purport, 8. Stages of cultivation and realization, 9. General explanation of the title, 10.

['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c18_14']	初有通別，通謂酬因酬請顯理度生，一代教興皆由是矣。	初有通別，通謂酬因酬請顯理度生，一代教興皆由是矣。	The first has general and specific. The general refers to repaying causes, responding to requests, revealing the truth, and liberating beings. The rise of the teachings of the entire lifetime [of the Buddha] are all due to this.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c19_11']	若原佛本意，則唯為一大事因緣故。	若原佛本意，則唯為一大事因緣故。	If one traces the Buddha's original intention, it is solely for the cause and condition of the one great matter.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c20_3']	別者，有十所為故說此經。	別者，有十所為故說此經。	The specific refers to the ten reasons for expounding this sutra.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c20_13']	一、顯示因行有本故。	一、顯示因行有本故。	First, to reveal that causal practices have a basis.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c21_13']	圓照淨覺，了無明空，發清淨心，方修萬行。	圓照淨覺，了無明空，發清淨心，方修萬行。	Fully illuminating pure awareness, realizing the emptiness of ignorance, giving rise to the pure mind, and then cultivating myriad practices.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c22_9']	二、泯絕果相成圓故。	二、泯絕果相成圓故。	Second, to obliterate the characteristics of fruition and perfect it.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c23_18']	本無菩提涅槃，唯是清淨覺性，故無始終增減，方為究竟之果。	本無菩提涅槃，唯是清淨覺性，故無始終增減，方為究竟之果。	Originally there is no enlightenment or nirvana, only the pure nature of enlightenment, therefore, it is without beginning or end, increase or decrease, and is the ultimate fruit.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c24_9']	三、決擇悟理應修故。	三、決擇悟理應修故。	Third, in order to determine that one should cultivate in accordance with the understanding of the principle.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c24_15']	普賢問意云：	普賢問意云：	The meaning of Samantabhadra's question is:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c25_6']	覺性本圓，一切如幻。	覺性本圓，一切如幻。	The nature of enlightenment is originally perfect, and everything is like an illusion.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c25_16']	幻空無體，誰曰修行？	幻空無體，誰曰修行？	Illusions are empty and have no substance, who would say to cultivate?
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c26_4']	如其不修，何因證覺？	如其不修，何因證覺？	If one does not cultivate, how can one realize enlightenment?
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c27_5']	佛說因起幻智以除諸幻，幻盡智泯覺心圓明。	佛說因起幻智以除諸幻，幻盡智泯覺心圓明。	The Buddha said that one gives rise to illusory wisdom in order to eliminate all illusions, when illusions are exhausted and wisdom disappears, the enlightened mind is perfectly clear.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c27_18']	然今唯說空幻者，溺在無修。	然今唯說空幻者，溺在無修。	However, now only those who speak of emptiness and illusions are immersed in non-cultivation.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0524c29_9']	修習之徒縛於有得，良由悟修之意似反而符，故最難明，理須決擇。	修習之徒縛於有得，良由悟修之意似反而符，故最難明，理須決擇。	Those who practice are bound by attainment. It is because the meaning of understanding and cultivation seems contrary but is actually in accord, therefore, it is most difficult to understand, and the principle must be determined.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a01_9']	四、窮盡甚深疑念故。	四、窮盡甚深疑念故。	Fourth, in order to exhaust the doubts about the profound.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a01_15']	菩薩難意云：	菩薩難意云：	The meaning of the Bodhisattva's difficulty is:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a02_1']	眾生本佛；	眾生本佛；	Sentient beings are originally Buddhas;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a02_15']	今既無明，十方如來後應煩惱。	今既無明，十方如來後應煩惱。	Now that they have ignorance, the Tathāgatas of the ten directions should have afflictions later.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a02_20']	佛答意云：	佛答意云：	The meaning of the Buddha's answer is:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a04_5']	即此分別便是無明，故見圓覺亦同流轉，如雲駛月運等。	即此分別便是無明，故見圓覺亦同流轉，如雲駛月運等。	This discrimination itself is ignorance, so seeing even the perfect enlightenment is the same as wandering in samsara, like the moving clouds and the moving moon.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a05_5']	但一念不生則前後際斷，如醫差華亡等。	但一念不生則前後際斷，如醫差華亡等。	But if there is not a single thought arising, then the past and future are cut off, like the disappearance of the flower when the eyes are cured.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a06_13']	眾生即佛，人罕能知，知而寡信，信而鮮解，解亦難臻此境。	眾生即佛，人罕能知，知而寡信，信而鮮解，解亦難臻此境。	Few people can understand that sentient beings are buddhas, and even fewer believe it after understanding, and even fewer understand it after believing. Understanding is also difficult to reach this realm.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a07_13']	今經決了，實謂窮源，苟能精通，群疑自釋。	今經決了，實謂窮源，苟能精通，群疑自釋。	Now the sutra is definitive, truly exhausting the source. If one can thoroughly understand, then the many doubts will be naturally resolved.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a08_9']	五、除斷輪迴根本故。	五、除斷輪迴根本故。	Fifth, in order to eliminate the fundamental cause of samsara.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a09_9']	發業成種，無明為根，潤業受生，貪愛為本。	發業成種，無明為根，潤業受生，貪愛為本。	The karma-producing seeds are rooted in ignorance, and the nourishing of karma and rebirth is rooted in craving and attachment.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a09_20']	若不識其相，賊即能為；	若不識其相，賊即能為；	If one does not recognize its characteristics, the thief can do as it pleases;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a10_10']	若不達其空，永不可斷。	若不達其空，永不可斷。	if one does not realize its emptiness, it can never be eliminated.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a11_4']	故答文殊、彌勒究了，盡其根源。	故答文殊、彌勒究了，盡其根源。	Therefore, the answer to Manjushri and Maitreya thoroughly investigates and exhausts its root source.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a12_9']	六、搜索菩提隱障故。	六、搜索菩提隱障故。	Sixth, in order to search out the hidden obstacles to enlightenment.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a14_9']	謂我人眾生壽命雖名同諸教，而行相深密，從麁至細展轉難除，故淨業一章重重搜索。	謂我人眾生壽命雖名同諸教，而行相深密，從麁至細展轉難除，故淨業一章重重搜索。	That is to say, although the terms self, person, sentient being, and life are the same as in other teachings, their modes of activity are profound and subtle, becoming increasingly difficult to eliminate from coarse to subtle. Therefore, the chapter on pure conduct thoroughly searches for them.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a15_9']	七、少文能攝多門故。	七、少文能攝多門故。	Seventh, because it can include many approaches with few words.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a16_9']	文唯二十八紙，義具頓漸空有，悟修性相。	文唯二十八紙，義具頓漸空有，悟修性相。	The text is only twenty-eight pages, yet it contains the sudden, gradual, empty, and existent, as well as the nature, characteristics, realization, and cultivation.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a17_19']	八、一法一一文中無不標依圓覺、結入圓覺。	八、一法一一文中無不標依圓覺、結入圓覺。	Eighth, in each and every passage, it does not fail to take perfect enlightenment as its basis and conclude with perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a18_5']	巧被三根故。	巧被三根故。	This is because it skillfully accommodates the three capacities.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a19_11']	普眼觀門被上根，三觀諸輪被中根，道場加行被下根。	普眼觀門被上根，三觀諸輪被中根，道場加行被下根。	The universal eye's method of contemplation accommodates the superior capacity, the three contemplations and various wheels accommodate the middling capacity, and the field of practice accommodates the inferior capacity.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a20_9']	九、令修稱性深禪故。	九、令修稱性深禪故。	Ninth, because it causes the cultivation to accord with the profound meditation of the nature.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a21_1']	三觀皆以悟淨圓覺為本。	三觀皆以悟淨圓覺為本。	All three contemplations take the realization of perfect enlightenment as their basis.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a22_9']	十、勸事離相明師故。	十、勸事離相明師故。	Tenth, because it encourages serving a teacher who is free from characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a24_16']	佛本是而勤修、惑元無而須斷，無軌可則、無迹可依，必須離相明師觸向曉喻，故令親近、盡命亡軀等。	佛本是而勤修、惑元無而須斷，無軌可則、無迹可依，必須離相明師觸向曉喻，故令親近、盡命亡軀等。	The Buddha originally is and diligently cultivates, the root of delusion is originally nonexistent and must be severed. There are no tracks to follow, no traces to rely on. One must part from characteristics and rely on a clear teacher to be enlightened. Therefore, it is said to be intimate, to the point of losing one's life.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a26_15']	二藏乘分攝者，謂三藏之中修多羅攝，二藏之中菩薩藏攝，諸乘之中一乘所攝。	二藏乘分攝者，謂三藏之中修多羅攝，二藏之中菩薩藏攝，諸乘之中一乘所攝。	As for the classification of the two treasuries and vehicles, it is said that among the three treasuries it is included in the sūtras, among the two treasuries it is included in the bodhisattva treasury, and among the various vehicles it is included in the one vehicle.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a27_1']	十二分中：	十二分中：	Among the twelve divisions:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525a29_9']	一契經、二應頌、三授記、四諷頌、五因緣、六自說、七本事、八本生、九方廣、十未曾有、十一譬喻、十二論義。	一契經、二應頌、三授記、四諷頌、五因緣、六自說、七本事、八本生、九方廣、十未曾有、十一譬喻、十二論義。	1. Sūtra, 2. Gāthā, 3. Vyākaraṇa, 4. Geya, 5. Udāna, 6. Nidāna, 7. Itivṛttaka, 8. Jātaka, 9. Vaipulya, 10. Adbhutadharma, 11. Avadāna, 12. Upadeśa.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b01_9']	契經、方廣二分所攝。	契經、方廣二分所攝。	It is included in the two divisions of sūtra and vaipulya.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b03_8']	三權實對辨者，然西域此方古今諸德立宗判教離合有殊，或一味不分、或開宗料簡。	三權實對辨者，然西域此方古今諸德立宗判教離合有殊，或一味不分、或開宗料簡。	As for the third, distinguishing the provisional and the real, the masters of the Western Regions and China in ancient times established tenets and classified the teachings, either combining or separating them in different ways. Some did not distinguish them at all, while others opened up the teachings and analyzed them.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b03_18']	今將略敘，且啟二門：	今將略敘，且啟二門：	Now I will briefly describe it, and open up two approaches:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b04_7']	初則不分、後明分教。	初則不分、後明分教。	The first is not dividing, and the latter is clarifying the divided teachings.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b04_16']	不分之意其有五焉：	不分之意其有五焉：	The reasons for not dividing are fivefold:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b05_8']	一、理本一味，殊途同歸故；	一、理本一味，殊途同歸故；	First, the principle is originally of one flavor, and the different paths return to the same destination;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b05_21']	二、一音普應，一雨普滋故；	二、一音普應，一雨普滋故；	Second, the one sound universally responds, and the one rain universally nourishes;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b06_11']	三、原佛本意，為一事故；	三、原佛本意，為一事故；	Third, the Buddha's original intention is for one matter;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b07_2']	四、隨一一文，眾解不同故；	四、隨一一文，眾解不同故；	Fourth, for each and every text, the various understandings are not the same;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b07_19']	五、多種說法，成枝流故，故不可分。	五、多種說法，成枝流故，故不可分。	Fifth, the many kinds of teachings lead to branches and streams, therefore they cannot be divided.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b08_17']	即後魏流支、姚秦羅什立一音教，是此意也。	即後魏流支、姚秦羅什立一音教，是此意也。	This is the intention of later Wei Dynasty Liu Zhi and Yao Qin Dynasty Kumarajiva establishing the one sound teaching.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b09_8']	其分教者，有其八意：	其分教者，有其八意：	As for the divided teachings, there are eight intentions:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b09_18']	初五翻前、後三別說。	初五翻前、後三別說。	The first five reverse the previous, and the last three are separate explanations.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b10_12']	一、理雖一味，詮有淺深故。	一、理雖一味，詮有淺深故。	First, although the principle is of one flavor, the explanations have shallow and profound levels;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b11_3']	二、佛雖一音，教隨機異故。	二、佛雖一音，教隨機異故。	Second, although the Buddha has one sound, the teachings vary according to the capacities of the audience;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b11_16']	三、本意未申，隨他意語故。	三、本意未申，隨他意語故。	Third, the original intention is not fully expressed, as it is spoken according to the intentions of others;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b12_6']	四、言有通別，就顯說故。	四、言有通別，就顯說故。	Fourth, there is both general and specific in the words, spoken for the sake of manifestation.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b12_19']	五、由辨權實，不住枝流故。	五、由辨權實，不住枝流故。	Fifth, due to the distinction between provisional and real, one does not dwell in the branches and streams.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b13_9']	六、王之密語，語同事別故。	六、王之密語，語同事別故。	Sixth, the secret language of the king, the words and activities are the same but different.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b14_4']	七、不識佛意，以深為淺失於大利；	七、不識佛意，以深為淺失於大利；	Seventh, not knowing the Buddha's intention, taking the profound as shallow misses the great benefit;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b14_14']	以淺為深，虛其功故。	以淺為深，虛其功故。	Taking the shallow as profound, it is in vain.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b15_4']	八、諸佛菩薩亦自分故。	八、諸佛菩薩亦自分故。	Eighth, the buddhas and bodhisattvas also have their own divisions.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b17_2']	以斯等意，開則得多失少、合則得少失多，但能虛己求宗分，亦何乖大旨，故今分之。	以斯等意，開則得多失少、合則得少失多，但能虛己求宗分，亦何乖大旨，故今分之。	With these intentions, opening up yields many losses and few gains, combining yields few gains and many losses. But if one can empty oneself and seek the divisions of the school, then what contradicts the great purport? Therefore, I now divide it.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b17_13']	然就分教，又諸德不同。	然就分教，又諸德不同。	However, in terms of dividing the teachings, the various virtuous ones are not the same.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b18_4']	今依賢首大師，統收為五：	今依賢首大師，統收為五：	Now, relying on the Great Master Xian-shou, it is summarized into five:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b19_8']	一小乘教、二大乘始教、三終教、四一乘頓教、五圓教。	一小乘教、二大乘始教、三終教、四一乘頓教、五圓教。	First, the Hīnayāna teaching; second, the initial teaching of the Mahāyāna; third, the final teaching; fourth, the sudden teaching of the One Vehicle; fifth, the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b21_6']	初者以隨機故、隨他語故，說諸法數一向差別，以其簡邪正、辯凡聖、分欣厭、明因果。	初者以隨機故、隨他語故，說諸法數一向差別，以其簡邪正、辯凡聖、分欣厭、明因果。	First, because it follows the capacities of beings and accords with the words of others, it teaches the various dharmas with a single-sided distinction, distinguishing right from wrong, discerning the ordinary and the sacred, dividing joy and disgust, clarifying cause and effect.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b23_1']	然其所說法數有七十五，但說人空、不明法空，唯依六識三毒建立染淨根本；	然其所說法數有七十五，但說人空、不明法空，唯依六識三毒建立染淨根本；	However, the number of dharmas it teaches is seventy-five. It only speaks of the emptiness of persons and does not clarify the emptiness of dharmas. It establishes the root of defilement and purity based on the six consciousnesses and the three poisons.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b23_11']	未盡法源，故多諍論。	未盡法源，故多諍論。	It has not yet exhausted the source of the Dharma, so there are many disputes.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b23_21']	二始教者，亦名分教。	二始教者，亦名分教。	Second, the initial teaching is also called the partial teaching.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b25_2']	以《深密》第二第三時教同許定性無性俱不成佛故。	以《深密》第二第三時教同許定性無性俱不成佛故。	Because the second and third periods of teachings in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra both agree that those of fixed nature and those without nature are both unable to become Buddhas.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b26_13']	今合之總為一教，此既未盡大乘法理，故立為初，有不成佛故名為分。	今合之總為一教，此既未盡大乘法理，故立為初，有不成佛故名為分。	Now, combining them, it is taken as a single teaching. Since this has not yet exhausted the principle of the Mahāyāna Dharma, it is established as the initial. Because there are those who do not become Buddhas, it is called partial.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b27_12']	廣說法相，削繁錄數猶有一百，少說法性。	廣說法相，削繁錄數猶有一百，少說法性。	It extensively explains the characteristics of dharmas, and even though it has reduced the繁 to record the number of dharmas, there are still one hundred. It speaks little of the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525b28_12']	所說法性即法相數，決擇分明，故少諍論。	所說法性即法相數，決擇分明，故少諍論。	The nature of dharmas that it speaks of is the number of characteristics of dharmas. It decisively distinguishes clearly, so there are few disputes.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c01_9']	三終教者，亦名實教，定性二乘、無性闡提悉當成佛，方盡大乘至極之說，故立為終。	三終教者，亦名實教，定性二乘、無性闡提悉當成佛，方盡大乘至極之說，故立為終。	Third, the definitive teaching, also called the true teaching, states that those of fixed potential in the two vehicles and those of indeterminate potential will all attain Buddhahood. It is the ultimate teaching of the Great Vehicle, and thus it is established as the final.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c01_19']	以稱實理，故名為實。	以稱實理，故名為實。	Because it accords with the truth, it is called true.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c03_2']	少說法相多說法性，所說法相亦會歸性，故無諍論。	少說法相多說法性，所說法相亦會歸性，故無諍論。	It speaks little of the characteristics of dharmas and much of the nature of dharmas. Even the characteristics of dharmas that are spoken of are subsumed within the nature. Therefore, there is no dispute.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c03_20']	上二教，並依地位漸次修成，總名為漸。	上二教，並依地位漸次修成，總名為漸。	The above two teachings both rely on gradual cultivation through stages of spiritual development. They are collectively called gradual.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c06_7']	然大乘教總有三宗，謂法相、破相，二皆漸教之始，即戒賢、智光二論師，各依一經立三時教，互相破斥。	然大乘教總有三宗，謂法相、破相，二皆漸教之始，即戒賢、智光二論師，各依一經立三時教，互相破斥。	However, the teachings of the Great Vehicle are generally divided into three schools, namely, the school of characteristics, the school of negation of characteristics, and the school of nature. The first two are the beginning of the gradual teachings. The two masters, *Śīlabhadra and *Jñānagupta, each established a three-period teaching based on a sūtra and refuted each other.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c07_5']	而傳習者，皆認法性之經，成立自宗之義。	而傳習者，皆認法性之經，成立自宗之義。	Those who transmit and study [the teachings] all recognize the sūtras of the nature of dharmas and establish the meaning of their own school.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c08_2']	法性。	法性。	nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c08_17']	通於頓漸，漸即終教，終於始故。	通於頓漸，漸即終教，終於始故。	It is common to both the sudden and gradual teachings. The gradual [teaching] is the final teaching, because it ends with the initial [teaching].
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c09_2']	頓如後說。	頓如後說。	The sudden [teaching] will be explained later.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c10_14']	今將法性對二宗料簡，即為二門：	今將法性對二宗料簡，即為二門：	Now, I will use the nature of dharmas to distinguish between the two schools, which will be divided into two sections:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c11_4']	一對法相、二對破相。	一對法相、二對破相。	First, comparing with the characteristics of dharmas; second, comparing with the destruction of characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c12_5']	初中性相二宗有多差別，今隨類束略敘十條：	初中性相二宗有多差別，今隨類束略敘十條：	In the first section, the nature and characteristics schools have many differences. Now, following their types, I will briefly discuss ten points:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c12_14']	一、三乘性五故也。	一、三乘性五故也。	First, because of the five natures of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c13_9']	初小、次一不了，後具三乘為了。	初小、次一不了，後具三乘為了。	The first is small, the next one is not yet understood, and the last one is equipped with the three vehicles for understanding.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c13_16']	《深密》云云。	《深密》云云。	The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra says so and so forth.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c14_2']	一乘。	一乘。	One vehicle.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c14_7']	生一故也。	生一故也。	Because it produces one.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c15_3']	初小、次二不了，後唯一乘為了。	初小、次二不了，後唯一乘為了。	The first is small, the next two are not yet understood, and the last one is the only vehicle for understanding.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c15_11']	《法華》等云云。	《法華》等云云。	The Lotus Sūtra and others say so and so forth.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c16_16']	三、五性《楞伽》等中皆說五種性故。	三、五性《楞伽》等中皆說五種性故。	Third, the five natures. In the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and other texts, it is said that there are five kinds of natures.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c17_2']	一性。	一性。	One nature.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c20_2']	《法華》、《楞伽》、《涅槃》皆唯一性，趣寂聲聞餘國佛度故、菩薩與記當作佛故、闡提有佛性故、《攝論》立法一居三後故、《法華》破三多嫉怨故。	《法華》、《楞伽》、《涅槃》皆唯一性，趣寂聲聞餘國佛度故、菩薩與記當作佛故、闡提有佛性故、《攝論》立法一居三後故、《法華》破三多嫉怨故。	The Lotus Sutra, the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, and the Nirvana Sutra all speak of only one nature, because the śrāvakas who have entered cessation are liberated by the Buddhas in other lands, because bodhisattvas are given predictions that they will become Buddhas, because icchantikas have the Buddha-nature, because the Compendium of the Great Vehicle establishes the one abode in the three periods of time, and because the Lotus Sutra refutes the many and is jealous of the one.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c21_11']	三、唯心妄八識從惑業生。	三、唯心妄八識從惑業生。	Third, only the mind is deluded. The eight consciousnesses arise from afflictions and karma.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c22_1']	真。	真。	True.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c22_8']	八識通如來藏。	八識通如來藏。	The eight consciousnesses are the Tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c23_15']	四、真如凝然八識生滅，故非隨緣。	四、真如凝然八識生滅，故非隨緣。	Fourth, true suchness is unmoving. The eight consciousnesses are born and perish, therefore they are not conditioned.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c24_2']	隨緣。	隨緣。	Conditioned.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c24_18']	八識依藏性故，但是真如隨緣成立。	八識依藏性故，但是真如隨緣成立。	Because the eight consciousnesses depend on the nature of the repository, they are only the true suchness that is conditioned to establish itself.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c25_14']	五、三性空有離遍計空，依圓有。	五、三性空有離遍計空，依圓有。	Fifth, the three natures are empty and existent. Apart from the emptiness of the imagined, the dependent and perfected exist.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c26_1']	即。	即。	Immediate.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c26_6']	無性即圓。	無性即圓。	The naturelessness is the perfected.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c27_8']	六、生佛不增不減。	六、生佛不增不減。	Sixth, the Buddhas and sentient beings do not increase or decrease.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c27_19']	定性無性，決不成佛故。	定性無性，決不成佛故。	Because those with fixed natures and those without natures will definitely not become Buddhas.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c28_15']	生界不滅、一理齊平故，無增無減。	生界不滅、一理齊平故，無增無減。	Because the realm of sentient beings does not perish and the one principle is equal, there is no increase or decrease.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0525c29_11']	七、二諦空有離真俗條然。	七、二諦空有離真俗條然。	Seventh, the two truths are empty and existent, with true and conventional distinct.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a01_1']	即。	即。	Immediately.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a01_10']	第一義空該通真妄。	第一義空該通真妄。	The emptiness of ultimate truth encompasses both true and false.

['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a06_1']	即。	即。	Immediately.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a06_11']	惑即菩提，見即真如。	惑即菩提，見即真如。	Afflictions are identical to bodhi, and views are identical to true suchness.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a08_1']	十、佛身有為四智依生滅識種故，報身有為。	十、佛身有為四智依生滅識種故，報身有為。	Tenth, the Buddha's body is conditioned, with the four knowledges relying on the seeds of the consciousnesses that arise and cease, so the reward body is conditioned.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a09_2']	無為。	無為。	Unconditioned.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a10_8']	智依如來藏故，佛化身即常即法，不墮諸數，況報體耶？	智依如來藏故，佛化身即常即法，不墮諸數，況報體耶？	Knowledge relies on the Tathāgatagarbha, so the Buddha's transformation body is both permanent and the Dharma, not falling into any categories, let alone the reward body?
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a11_13']	若知二教權實，二宗亦不相違。	若知二教權實，二宗亦不相違。	If one understands the provisional and true of the two teachings, the two schools are also not contradictory.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a12_15']	謂就機則三、約法則一，新熏則五，本有無二等。	謂就機則三、約法則一，新熏則五，本有無二等。	Namely, according to the capacities there are three, according to the principle there is one, with new perfuming there are five, and with the original nature there are none, etc.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a13_6']	二、對破相者，略有五別：	二、對破相者，略有五別：	Second, in comparison with the school of characteristics, there are five differences:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a13_18']	一無性以諸法無性為真如。	一無性以諸法無性為真如。	First, the naturelessness of all dharmas is taken as suchness.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a14_2']	本性。	本性。	The inherent nature.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a14_11']	以常住真心為真如。	以常住真心為真如。	The eternally abiding true mind is taken as suchness.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a15_9']	二、真智能了無性者。	二、真智能了無性者。	Second, the true cognition that understands naturelessness.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a16_2']	真知。	真知。	True knowledge.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a17_13']	一心真實本自能知，通於理智、徹於染淨，如《華嚴．問明品》說。	一心真實本自能知，通於理智、徹於染淨，如《華嚴．問明品》說。	The one mind is originally self-aware, penetrating both principle and wisdom, and pervading both the defiled and the pure, as explained in the Questions and Answers chapter of the Flower Ornament Sutra.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a18_13']	二、二諦色等俗也，空即真也。	二、二諦色等俗也，空即真也。	Second, form and so forth are conventional, while emptiness is the true.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a20_9']	三諦加第一義諦，謂一真心性，非空非色、能空能色，如鏡之明。	三諦加第一義諦，謂一真心性，非空非色、能空能色，如鏡之明。	The three truths, adding the truth of ultimate meaning, refer to the nature of the one true mind, which is neither empty nor form, yet can be empty and can be form, like the brightness of a mirror.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a21_6']	四、三性空有。	四、三性空有。	Third, the emptiness and existence of the three natures.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a21_19']	空宗，有謂依計、空謂圓成。	空宗，有謂依計、空謂圓成。	In the school of emptiness, existence refers to the dependent and the imagined, while emptiness refers to the perfected.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a23_8']	性宗，即遍計情有理無，依他相有性無，圓成情無理有、相無性有。	性宗，即遍計情有理無，依他相有性無，圓成情無理有、相無性有。	In the school of nature, the imagined is emotionally existent but rationally nonexistent, the dependent is existent in appearance but nonexistent in nature, while the perfected is emotionally nonexistent but naturally existent, and is nonexistent in appearance but naturally existent.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a25_14']	五、佛德空雖說佛身五求不得，得則虛忘、無得乃真，離一切相，名佛功德。	五、佛德空雖說佛身五求不得，得則虛忘、無得乃真，離一切相，名佛功德。	Fifth, although it is said that the Buddha's body cannot be found through the five searches, if it can be found, it is empty and false, and only in non-attainment is it true. Being apart from all characteristics is called the Buddha's merit.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a26_1']	有。	有。	Yes.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a27_5']	諸佛皆具常樂我淨真實功德，身智通光一一無盡。	諸佛皆具常樂我淨真實功德，身智通光一一無盡。	All Buddhas are endowed with the true merits of permanence, bliss, self, and purity, and their bodies, wisdom, spiritual powers, and light are all inexhaustible.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a27_15']	性自本有，不待機緣。	性自本有，不待機緣。	They naturally exist from the beginning and do not depend on conditions.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526a28_9']	略辨此五，餘可例知。	略辨此五，餘可例知。	Briefly distinguishing these five, the rest can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b01_1']	然得意者亦不相違，謂一切法既皆是真心緣起，緣起無性還即真心。	然得意者亦不相違，謂一切法既皆是真心緣起，緣起無性還即真心。	However, those who understand the meaning do not contradict each other. It is said that since all dharmas are the dependent origination of the true mind, the nature of dependent origination is itself the true mind.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b01_20']	始不異本、知外無智，餘諦性等例之可明。	始不異本、知外無智，餘諦性等例之可明。	The beginning is no different from the original, and there is no knowledge outside of wisdom. The other truths and natures can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b03_5']	然此門與前後別，但教有始終漸頓之殊，法非深淺之異。	然此門與前後別，但教有始終漸頓之殊，法非深淺之異。	However, this approach is different from the previous ones. It is only because the teachings have a beginning and an end, gradual and sudden differences, while the Dharma is not different in depth.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b04_15']	四、頓教者，但一念不生即名為佛，不依地位漸次而說，故立為頓。	四、頓教者，但一念不生即名為佛，不依地位漸次而說，故立為頓。	Fourth, the sudden teaching is that a single thought of non-arising is called Buddhahood, and it is not based on the gradual stages of attainment. Therefore, it is established as sudden.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b05_1']	《思益經》云：	《思益經》云：	The Siyi Sutra says:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b05_18']	「得諸法正性者，不從一地至於一地。	「得諸法正性者，不從一地至於一地。	Those who attain the correct nature of all dharmas do not go from one stage to another stage.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b06_3']	」《楞伽經》云：	」《楞伽經》云：	The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra says:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b06_16']	「初地即為八，乃至無所有。	「初地即為八，乃至無所有。	The first stage is the eighth, and so on, up to the non-existent.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b06_20']	」何次？	」何次？	What is the sequence?
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b07_10']	總不說法性，唯辯真性。	總不說法性，唯辯真性。	It does not speak of the nature of dharmas in general, but only discusses the true nature.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b08_10']	一切所有唯是忘想，一切法界唯是絕言。	一切所有唯是忘想，一切法界唯是絕言。	All that exists is only the forgetting of thoughts, and all dharma realms are only beyond words.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b09_7']	五法、三自性皆空，八識、二無我都遣。	五法、三自性皆空，八識、二無我都遣。	The five dharmas and three natures are all empty, and the eight consciousnesses and two non-existences are all eliminated.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b10_6']	訶教勸離、毀相泯心，生心即妄、不生即佛。	訶教勸離、毀相泯心，生心即妄、不生即佛。	It criticizes teachings and encourages detachment, destroys characteristics and obliterates the mind. Giving rise to the mind is delusion, not giving rise to it is Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b10_17']	泯之迹絕，方顯真性故。	泯之迹絕，方顯真性故。	The traces of obliteration are cut off, and only then does the true nature manifest.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b13_13']	五、圓教者，明一位即一切位、一切位即一位，是故十信滿心即攝五位成正覺等，主伴具足故名圓教，即《華嚴經》也。	五、圓教者，明一位即一切位、一切位即一位，是故十信滿心即攝五位成正覺等，主伴具足故名圓教，即《華嚴經》也。	Fifth, the perfect teaching clarifies that one stage is all stages, and all stages are one stage. Therefore, at the end of the stage of ten faiths, the five stages are included and perfect enlightenment is attained, and so on. The host and companions are complete, so it is called the perfect teaching, which is the Flower Ornament Sutra.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b14_19']	所說唯是無盡法界，性海圓融緣起無礙，如帝網珠重重無盡。	所說唯是無盡法界，性海圓融緣起無礙，如帝網珠重重無盡。	What is expounded is only the inexhaustible Dharma realm, the perfectly interfused nature ocean, the unobstructed conditioned arising, like the jewels in the emperor's net, layer upon layer, inexhaustible.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b15_17']	已知五教貫於群詮，未審此經與彼何攝？	已知五教貫於群詮，未審此經與彼何攝？	Having already understood that the five teachings pervade all the scriptures, I have yet to inquire about which of them this sutra belongs to.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b16_7']	今顯此義，分作三門：	今顯此義，分作三門：	Now, to clarify this meaning, I will divide it into three sections:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b17_2']	一、彼全攝此，此分攝彼，謂圓教也；	一、彼全攝此，此分攝彼，謂圓教也；	First, that completely includes this, and this partially includes that, referring to the perfect teaching;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b17_20']	二、此分攝彼，彼不攝此，謂初、二也；	二、此分攝彼，彼不攝此，謂初、二也；	Second, this partially includes that, but that does not include this, referring to the initial and second [teachings];
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b18_12']	三、彼此克體全相攝屬，即終頓也。	三、彼此克體全相攝屬，即終頓也。	Third, the essence of this and that completely includes each other, referring to the final and sudden [teachings].
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b18_18']	權實對辨訖。	權實對辨訖。	The comparison between provisional and true has been completed.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b20_12']	四、分齊幽深者，約《起信論》明諸染法本末五重，以顯諸宗所詮分齊深淺。	四、分齊幽深者，約《起信論》明諸染法本末五重，以顯諸宗所詮分齊深淺。	Fourth, as for the profound division, based on the Awakening of Faith, it clarifies the five levels of the fundamental and derivative defiled dharmas, in order to reveal the depth and shallowness of the division and interpretation of the various schools.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b21_3']	論中初唯一心為本源。	論中初唯一心為本源。	In the treatise, there is initially only one mind as the fundamental source.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b21_12']	二、依一心開二門：	二、依一心開二門：	Second, based on one mind, two gates are opened:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b22_6']	一者心真如門，謂心性不生不滅；	一者心真如門，謂心性不生不滅；	First, the gate of mind as true suchness, referring to the unborn and unceasing nature of the mind;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b23_10']	二者心生滅門，謂依如來藏與生滅合，名阿黎耶識。	二者心生滅門，謂依如來藏與生滅合，名阿黎耶識。	Second, the arising and ceasing of mind, which means that based on the tathāgatagarbha uniting with arising and ceasing, it is called the ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b23_19']	三、依此識明二義：	三、依此識明二義：	Third, based on this consciousness to clarify two meanings:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b24_11']	一覺義始本，謂心體離念等；	一覺義始本，謂心體離念等；	First, the meaning of enlightenment, beginning and original, which means the mind essence is apart from thoughts, etc.;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b25_12']	二、不覺義，謂不如實知真如法一，不覺心起等。	二、不覺義，謂不如實知真如法一，不覺心起等。	Second, the meaning of non-enlightenment, which means not truly knowing the one true suchness dharma, the mind of non-enlightenment arises, etc.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b26_1']	四、依後義生三細：	四、依後義生三細：	Fourth, based on the latter meaning to give rise to three subtle [aspects]:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b26_13']	一、依不覺故心動名業相；	一、依不覺故心動名業相；	First, based on non-enlightenment, the mind moves and is called the aspect of activity;

['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b27_16']	三、依見故境界妄現名現相。	三、依見故境界妄現名現相。	Third, based on seeing, the objects falsely appear and are called the aspect of manifestation.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b28_4']	五、依最後生六麁：	五、依最後生六麁：	Fifth, based on the last [aspect] to give rise to six coarse [aspects]:
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b28_9']	一、智相；	一、智相；	First, the aspect of cognition;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526b29_1']	依境分別也，即法執俱生。	依境分別也，即法執俱生。	Based on discriminating objects, it is the innate grasping of dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526c01_5']	二、相續相；	二、相續相；	Second, the aspect of continuity;
['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526c01_18']	依智起念不斷，即法執分別。	依智起念不斷，即法執分別。	Based on cognition giving rise to thoughts that are unceasing, it is the discriminating grasping of dharmas.

['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526c02_16']	心起著故，即我執俱生。	心起著故，即我執俱生。	Because the mind gives rise to attachment, it is the innate grasping of the self.

['ZH_T39_1795_01a:0526c03_16']	我見分別，上四皆惑。	我見分別，上四皆惑。	The view of self is discrimination, and the above four are all afflictions.

The reason is that the fundamental essence and function are the grand framework of the principle and meaning, and the explanatory ability is the clear mirror of the written form.
