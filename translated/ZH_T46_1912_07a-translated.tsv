['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b14_12']	所以立此通塞一門。	所以立此通塞一門。	07a	The reason for establishing this one method of the unobstructed and blocked is.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b15_4']	檢彼破遍令塞得通。	檢彼破遍令塞得通。	07a	Examine and refute their all-pervasiveness, allowing the unobstructed to pass through.

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b16_4']	次何者下正明來意。	次何者下正明來意。	07a	Next, the section below on what is... correctly clarifies the intention.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b16_13']	於能生著同彼外道。	於能生著同彼外道。	07a	In generating attachment, it is the same as the non-Buddhists.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b17_5']	宜用通塞四句遍破。	宜用通塞四句遍破。	07a	It is appropriate to use the four propositions of obstruction and non-obstruction to refute all.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b18_3']	故知前破遍中但用能破破於所破。	故知前破遍中但用能破破於所破。	07a	Therefore, know that in the previous refutation of all-pervasiveness, only the refuting is used to refute the refuted.

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b20_7']	故云愛著觀空智慧。	故云愛著觀空智慧。	07a	Therefore, it is said to be the love and attachment to the wisdom of contemplating emptiness.

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b21_16']	破能著智如所破惑。	破能著智如所破惑。	07a	The refuting of the wisdom of attachment is like the delusions that are refuted.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b22_7']	故云能破如所破也。	故云能破如所破也。	07a	Therefore, it is said that the refuting is the same as what is refuted.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b22_16']	雖不愛著能破之觀。	雖不愛著能破之觀。	07a	Although one does not love and attach to the refuting contemplation,

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b24_16']	是故但用破遍破惑。	是故但用破遍破惑。	07a	Therefore, only the refutation of all-pervasiveness is used to refute delusions.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b25_7']	是故須以二句分別。	是故須以二句分別。	07a	Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish with two phrases.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b25_16', 'ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b26_15']	則使此文與前永異。🔽一者通途通塞則以所破為塞能破為通。	則使此文與前永異。 一者通途通塞則以所破為塞能破為通。	07a	This will make this text completely different from the previous one.🔽First, the general and specific blockages and unobstructedness take what is to be eliminated as blockage and what eliminates it as unobstructed.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b28_3']	二者別相通塞則以於能起著為塞破塞無著為通。	二者別相通塞則以於能起著為塞破塞無著為通。	07a	Second, the specific characteristics of blockages and unobstructedness take the arising of attachment as blockage and the elimination of blockage without attachment as unobstructed.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b28_8']	故下文云。	故下文云。	07a	Therefore, the text below says:
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357b28_17']	法相淺深任有通塞。	法相淺深任有通塞。	07a	The shallow and deep characteristics of dharmas may have blockages and unobstructedness.

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c05_17']	故下文云。	故下文云。	07a	Therefore, the text below says:
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c06_6']	於一一能一一所。	於一一能一一所。	07a	In each of the abilities and in each of the objects,

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c07_14']	所以復須四句分別。	所以復須四句分別。	07a	The reason for further needing the four statements is as follows:
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c08_2']	一者塞中得通。	一者塞中得通。	07a	First, obtaining penetration within obstruction;

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c10_11']	後之二句若塞已破即屬破遍。	後之二句若塞已破即屬破遍。	07a	The last two statements, if obstruction has already been broken, then it belongs to breaking through the universal.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c11_6']	若塞未破度入今文成前二句。	若塞未破度入今文成前二句。	07a	If obstruction has not yet been broken, it is included in this text to form the first two statements.

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c12_7']	謂通相別相兩意故也。	謂通相別相兩意故也。	07a	This is because it has the two meanings of general characteristics and specific characteristics.

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c22_2']	是故路經五百由旬。	是故路經五百由旬。	07a	Therefore, the road passes through five hundred yojanas.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c22_11']	經云導師善知通塞。	經云導師善知通塞。	07a	The sutra says the guide is well-versed in blockages and passages.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c23_2']	故用法華將導譬也。	故用法華將導譬也。	07a	Therefore, it uses the metaphor of the guide in the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c23_11']	是故須破古今諸釋。	是故須破古今諸釋。	07a	Therefore, it is necessary to refute the interpretations of the ancients and moderns.

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0357c26_4']	二乘正當七地八地云何言非。	二乘正當七地八地云何言非。	07a	Since the two vehicles are precisely the seventh and eighth grounds, why is it said they are not?

['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0358a01_4']	正當二乘不為四百。	正當二乘不為四百。	07a	It is precisely the two vehicles, not four hundred.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0358a01_15']	却以七八二地而為四百。	却以七八二地而為四百。	07a	But you use the seventh and eighth grounds as four hundred.
['ZH_T46_1912_07a:0358a02_10']	故汝所釋與彼大論通教義違。	故汝所釋與彼大論通教義違。	07a	Therefore your interpretation contradicts the meaning of the general teaching in the Great Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom.
