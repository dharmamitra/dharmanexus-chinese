It establishes the root of defilement and purity based on the six consciousnesses and the three poisons, and has not yet exhausted the source of dharmas, so there are many disputes.

Because there are those who do not attain Buddhahood, it is called partial. It extensively teaches the characteristics of dharmas and speaks little of the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1791_010:0503c26_14']	所說法性即法相數，決擇分明故少諍論。	所說法性即法相數，決擇分明故少諍論。	The nature of dharmas that it does teach is the same as the number of characteristics of dharmas. Because the distinctions are clear, there are few disputes.

It explains that the tathāgatagarbha follows conditions to become the ālaya consciousness, that conditioned arising is without nature, and that all are thusness. Those of fixed nature and those without nature will all become buddhas. It is the ultimate teaching of the Mahāyāna, and thus it is established as definitive. Because it accords with true reality, it is called true.

The five dharmas and three natures are all empty, the eight consciousnesses and two kinds of no-self are both to be eliminated.
