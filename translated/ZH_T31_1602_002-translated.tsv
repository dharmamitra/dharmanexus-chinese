['ZH_T31_1602_002:0486b07_18']	此處無分別智及彼相應心及心法，及彼所依止轉依，由深入所知義故，則能永害隨眠，非一切煩惱之所依處，不退轉法。	此處無分別智及彼相應心及心法，及彼所依止轉依，由深入所知義故，則能永害隨眠，非一切煩惱之所依處，不退轉法。	In this state, the nondiscriminating cognition, the mind and mental factors associated with it, and the basis of support that has been transformed, by penetrating deeply into the meaning of the knowable, are able to permanently eliminate the latent tendencies and are no longer the basis of all afflictions, and are the irreversible Dharma.
