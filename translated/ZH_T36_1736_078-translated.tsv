['ZH_T36_1736_078:0608c27_1']	據普賢言，應言順說，為欲成觀是本意故，名為順觀，即彼第九經〈觀像品〉第九。	據普賢言，應言順說，為欲成觀是本意故，名為順觀，即彼第九經〈觀像品〉第九。	According to Samantabhadra's statement, it should be said to be in accordance with the teachings, because the fundamental meaning of the contemplation is to be accomplished, it is called the contemplation in accordance with, which is the ninth chapter on contemplating the image in that very ninth sutra.

Therefore, among humans, the wheel-turning king is allowed to have the thirty-two marks but not the eighty minor marks, then the excellent characteristics are superior.
['ZH_T36_1736_078:0609a04_18']	故為此通。	故為此通。	Therefore, this is a general discussion.
