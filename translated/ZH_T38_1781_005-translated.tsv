['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a06_19']	一者能化、二者所化。	一者能化、二者所化。	005	First, the one who transforms; second, the one who is transformed.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a07_20']	〈不思議品〉辨能化教門，〈觀眾生品〉次明所化。	〈不思議品〉辨能化教門，〈觀眾生品〉次明所化。	005	The chapter on the inconceivable clarifies the teaching methods of the one who transforms, while the chapter on contemplating sentient beings next explains the one who is transformed.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a08_17']	又〈不思議品〉多明推慧，故有無方妙用；	又〈不思議品〉多明推慧，故有無方妙用；	005	Moreover, the chapter on the inconceivable often clarifies the wisdom of discernment, thus there are wondrous uses beyond the ordinary;
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a09_14']	〈觀眾生品〉多明實慧，謂眾生畢竟空。	〈觀眾生品〉多明實慧，謂眾生畢竟空。	005	The chapter on contemplating sentient beings often clarifies the wisdom of reality, referring to the ultimate emptiness of sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a10_10']	二智是經之大宗，故諸品盛談斯法。	二智是經之大宗，故諸品盛談斯法。	005	These two wisdoms are the great essence of the sūtra, thus the various chapters extensively discuss this principle.

This clarifies the fundamental meaning of the one who transforms and the one who is transformed.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a14_8']	若不識眾生則不識眾生病，若不識眾生病亦未達菩薩病，是故須善識眾生，則具了二義，釋曳前品意也。	若不識眾生則不識眾生病，若不識眾生病亦未達菩薩病，是故須善識眾生，則具了二義，釋曳前品意也。	005	If one does not understand sentient beings, one does not understand the illnesses of sentient beings. If one does not understand the illnesses of sentient beings, one has still not penetrated the illnesses of bodhisattvas. Therefore, one must skillfully understand sentient beings, which is to be fully aware of the two meanings, explaining the intention of the previous chapter.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a15_3']	所言觀眾生者，觀是達生之名。	所言觀眾生者，觀是達生之名。	005	As for observing sentient beings, observing is the name for penetrating into birth.

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a16_14']	又眾處受生，名為眾生。	又眾處受生，名為眾生。	005	Moreover, being born in many places is called sentient beings.

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a22_11']	訶梨所辨，世諦故有、真諦則無。	訶梨所辨，世諦故有、真諦則無。	005	The explanation by Harivarman is that they exist in the conventional truth but not in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a23_6']	而成實論師用訶梨義，次有三說：	而成實論師用訶梨義，次有三說：	005	The masters of the Satyasiddhi Śāstra use Harivarman's meaning, and there are three more explanations:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a24_5']	如招提寺談公等，明眾生有體有用有名。	如招提寺談公等，明眾生有體有用有名。	005	Like Tan Gong and others of the Zaoti Temple, they explain that sentient beings have substance, function, and name.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a25_2']	如開善智藏云「眾生無體，但有名用。	如開善智藏云「眾生無體，但有名用。	005	Like Kaishan Zhizang, he says that sentient beings have no substance but only have names and functions.

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a27_16']	」今此品觀眾生，並巽此義，可同犢子實有，亦異薩婆多都無，具如文說，故以目品。	」今此品觀眾生，並巽此義，可同犢子實有，亦異薩婆多都無，具如文說，故以目品。	005	In this chapter, sentient beings are discussed, all in accordance with this meaning. They can be the same as the Vātsīputrīyas who truly exist, and also different from the Sarvāstivādins who completely do not exist. It is as explained in the text, so it is used to name the chapter.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a28_1']	品開二章：	品開二章：	005	The chapter is divided into two sections:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a29_6']	第一淨名與文殊論於眾生、第二天女與身子次論眾生。	第一淨名與文殊論於眾生、第二天女與身子次論眾生。	005	The first is Vimalakīrti discussing sentient beings with Mañjuśrī, and the second is the celestial maiden discussing sentient beings with Śāriputra.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965a29_11']	初文有兩：	初文有兩：	005	The first text has two parts:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b01_3']	第一明化他行、次明自行。	第一明化他行、次明自行。	005	The first clarifies the practice of transforming others, and the second clarifies one's own practice.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b01_18']	化他行內，前觀眾生、次明四等。	化他行內，前觀眾生、次明四等。	005	Within the practice of transforming others, the previous section discusses observing sentient beings, and the next section clarifies the four kinds of equality.

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b02_5']	前問、次答。	前問、次答。	005	First, the question; next, the answer.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b02_18']	「爾時文殊師利問維摩詰言：	「爾時文殊師利問維摩詰言：	005	At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, saying:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b03_7']	菩薩云何觀於眾生」。	菩薩云何觀於眾生」。	005	How does a bodhisattva observe sentient beings?
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b04_11']	文殊所以問者，上不思議無方妙用，蓋是化眾生之法。	文殊所以問者，上不思議無方妙用，蓋是化眾生之法。	005	The reason why Mañjuśrī asks this is because the inconceivable and marvelous function above is precisely the method for transforming sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b06_9']	聽者謂有眾生之可化，是故今明若實有眾生則不思議事不成，而眾生亦不可化。	聽者謂有眾生之可化，是故今明若實有眾生則不思議事不成，而眾生亦不可化。	005	Listeners think there are sentient beings to be transformed, and therefore now it is clarified that if there really are sentient beings, then inconceivable events cannot be accomplished, and sentient beings also cannot be transformed.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b07_3']	今欲成能化所化，故問觀眾生。	今欲成能化所化，故問觀眾生。	005	Now, wishing to accomplish the transformer and the transformed, therefore he asks about observing sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b07_9']	「維摩詰言：	「維摩詰言：	005	Vimalakīrti said:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b07_19']	譬如幻師，見所幻人。	譬如幻師，見所幻人。	005	It is like a magician seeing the illusory people.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b08_7']	菩薩觀眾生為若此」。	菩薩觀眾生為若此」。	005	Bodhisattvas observe sentient beings in this way.

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b08_20']	眾生有二種：	眾生有二種：	005	Sentient beings are of two kinds:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b10_5']	若外道橫計，則如十三入乃至無烟之火，畢竟無此眾生。	若外道橫計，則如十三入乃至無烟之火，畢竟無此眾生。	005	If non-Buddhists falsely conceive, then like the thirteen sense-fields up to the fire without smoke, ultimately there are no such sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b12_10']	二者因緣假名眾生，非真實有，雖有非有、非有而有，故舉幻師觀幻之譬，如幻有非有、非有而有色。	二者因緣假名眾生，非真實有，雖有非有、非有而有，故舉幻師觀幻之譬，如幻有非有、非有而有色。	005	Second, the nominally existent sentient beings are not truly existent. Although they exist, they do not exist; although they do not exist, they exist. Therefore, the analogy of the magician observing the illusion is used, like the illusory existence that does not exist, does not not exist, and yet exists.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b12_12']	問：	問：	005	Question:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b13_9']	亦得觀假名眾生如十三入畢竟空耶？	亦得觀假名眾生如十三入畢竟空耶？	005	Can one also contemplate nominally existent sentient beings as ultimately empty like the thirteen sense bases?
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b13_11']	答：	答：	005	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b14_13']	假名雖有而畢竟非有，非有義邊亦得以此為喻。	假名雖有而畢竟非有，非有義邊亦得以此為喻。	005	Although nominally existent, they are ultimately non-existent. From the perspective of non-existence, this analogy can be used.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b16_4']	然眾生雖畢竟非有、宛然而有，十三入喻則不得類然，故非全譬也。	然眾生雖畢竟非有、宛然而有，十三入喻則不得類然，故非全譬也。	005	However, although sentient beings are ultimately non-existent, they still exist. The analogy of the thirteen sense bases cannot be used, so it is not a complete analogy.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b17_10']	此品觀眾生既如幻，上不思議乃至菩薩之疾並皆如幻。	此品觀眾生既如幻，上不思議乃至菩薩之疾並皆如幻。	005	In this chapter, contemplating sentient beings as illusory, the above inconceivability and even the bodhisattva's illness are all illusory.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b21_12']	「如智者見水中月、如鏡中見其面像、如熱時炎、如呼聲嚮、如空中雲、如水聚沫、如水上泡、如芭蕉堅、如電久住、如第五大、如第六陰、如第七情、如十三入、如十九界，菩薩觀眾生為若此」。	「如智者見水中月、如鏡中見其面像、如熱時炎、如呼聲嚮、如空中雲、如水聚沫、如水上泡、如芭蕉堅、如電久住、如第五大、如第六陰、如第七情、如十三入、如十九界，菩薩觀眾生為若此」。	005	Just as a wise person sees the moon in the water, sees one's own face in a mirror, sees heat waves, hears an echo, sees clouds in the sky, sees bubbles in water, sees foam on water, sees the solidity of a plantain tree, sees lightning lasting a long time, sees a fifth great element, sees a sixth aggregate, sees a seventh sense faculty, sees the thirteenth sense base, sees the nineteenth realm, the bodhisattva views sentient beings in the same way.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b22_6']	如鏡內像，不自不他，非無因有；	如鏡內像，不自不他，非無因有；	005	Just as an image in a mirror is neither self nor other, and does not exist without a cause;

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b23_5']	若從他有，則不藉面生；	若從他有，則不藉面生；	005	if it came from something else, it should not rely on a face to appear;
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b23_16']	如其無因，則不假鏡面。	如其無因，則不假鏡面。	005	if it had no cause, it should not depend on a mirror and a face.

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965b24_17']	眾生之相，類於此也。	眾生之相，類於此也。	005	The characteristics of sentient beings are similar to this.
['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965c01_2']	「如無色界色、如燋穀芽、如須陀洹身見、如阿那含入胎、如阿羅漢三毒、如得忍菩薩貪恚毀禁、如佛煩惱習、如盲者見色、如入滅定出入息、如空中鳥跡、如石女兒、如化人煩惱、如夢所見已寤、如滅度者受身、如無烟之火，菩薩觀眾生為若此」。	「如無色界色、如燋穀芽、如須陀洹身見、如阿那含入胎、如阿羅漢三毒、如得忍菩薩貪恚毀禁、如佛煩惱習、如盲者見色、如入滅定出入息、如空中鳥跡、如石女兒、如化人煩惱、如夢所見已寤、如滅度者受身、如無烟之火，菩薩觀眾生為若此」。	005	Just as there is form in the formless realm, just as there are sprouts in burnt seeds, just as there is the view of a self in a stream-enterer, just as a non-returner enters the womb, just as there are the three poisons in an arhat, just as there is greed, anger, and violation of precepts in a bodhisattva who has attained acceptance, just as there are habitual afflictions in a Buddha, just as a blind person sees forms, just as there is inhalation and exhalation in one who has entered cessation, just as there are bird tracks in the sky, just as there is a daughter of a stone woman, just as there are afflictions in a magically created person, just as one who has already awakened from a dream sees it, just as one who has attained final nirvana takes on a body, just as there is fire without smoke, the bodhisattva views sentient beings in this way.

['ZH_T38_1781_005:0965c04_16']	又大乘明上界無有麁色，借無麁為喻，故言無色耳。	又大乘明上界無有麁色，借無麁為喻，故言無色耳。	005	Moreover, the Mahayana teaches that there is no coarse form in the upper realms, using the absence of coarse form as a metaphor, so it is said to be formless.

Since the thought of the mind has ceased, the breath has no coming in or going out.
