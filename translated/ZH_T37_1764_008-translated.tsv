['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c14_3']	中有三：	中有三：	There are three parts to this:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c14_18']	一略明貪脫從緣集生，非是本有；	一略明貪脫從緣集生，非是本有；	First, briefly explaining that craving is liberated and arises from the collection of conditions, not being originally existent;
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c16_13']	二從緣生貪、從緣脫貪，廣辯其相、三「以是義故諸佛菩薩不定說」下總以結之。	二從緣生貪、從緣脫貪，廣辯其相、三「以是義故諸佛菩薩不定說」下總以結之。	Second, elaborating on the arising of craving from conditions and the liberation from craving through conditions; Third, concluding by saying, For this reason, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not definitively say...
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c18_7']	前中，初先開列二門，「終不定說心有淨性」是其一門，「及不淨性」復為一門。	前中，初先開列二門，「終不定說心有淨性」是其一門，「及不淨性」復為一門。	In the first part, it first opens and lists two aspects: The mind definitely does not have a pure nature is one aspect, and nor does it have an impure nature is another aspect.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c19_7']	次總釋之，「淨、不淨性無住處故」，不作定說。	次總釋之，「淨、不淨性無住處故」，不作定說。	Next, it generally explains, The nature of purity and impurity has no fixed abode, so it is not definitively said.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c20_20']	下別釋之，「從緣生貪，故說非無」明無淨性，「本無貪性，故說非有」明無染性。	下別釋之，「從緣生貪，故說非無」明無淨性，「本無貪性，故說非有」明無染性。	Below, it specifically explains, Because craving arises from conditions, it is said not to be nonexistent, clarifying that there is no pure nature. Because the nature of craving is originally nonexistent, it is said not to exist, clarifying that there is no defiled nature.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c22_2']	廣中，初先開列兩門，「從緣生貪」則為一門，明無淨性；	廣中，初先開列兩門，「從緣生貪」則為一門，明無淨性；	In the extensive explanation, first it opens and lists two gates. Arising from conditions and giving rise to craving is one gate, clarifying the absence of pure nature;
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c22_18']	「從緣心脫」復為一門，明無染性。	「從緣心脫」復為一門，明無染性。	Arising from conditions and the mind being liberated is another gate, clarifying the absence of defiled nature.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c24_7']	次列二緣，先標後列，「隨於生死」是其染緣，「隨大涅槃」是其淨緣。	次列二緣，先標後列，「隨於生死」是其染緣，「隨大涅槃」是其淨緣。	Next, it lists two conditions, first indicating and then listing. Following along with birth and death is the defiled condition, and following along with the great nirvana is the pure condition.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c25_6']	下約二緣對貪明脫，四門辯之，先列後解。	下約二緣對貪明脫，四門辯之，先列後解。	Below, it discusses liberation by clarifying craving in relation to the two conditions, analyzing it in four gates, first listing and then explaining.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c26_9']	於初門中，先問後釋。	於初門中，先問後釋。	In the first gate, it first asks and then explains.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c28_2']	此門偏就凡夫說之，若凡未斷修習貪心，如是之人共貪生滅就起者說；	此門偏就凡夫說之，若凡未斷修習貪心，如是之人共貪生滅就起者說；	This gate speaks of it in terms of ordinary beings. If an ordinary being has not yet severed the mind that cultivates and gives rise to craving, such a person is said to give rise to craving together with birth and death;
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c28_11']	現起貪欲名為修習。	現起貪欲名為修習。	The present arising of craving and desire is called cultivation and practice.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c29_1']	「一切生」下就成者說。	「一切生」下就成者說。	All births and below speak of those who have accomplished it.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0815c29_17']	於中初法，次喻，後合，下重釋之。	於中初法，次喻，後合，下重釋之。	In this, first there is the Dharma, next the analogy, and finally the combination. Below it is explained again.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a02_12']	法中，「一切不斷貪心共生滅」者，有人雖復得定伏貪而未斷除，使性在心故共生滅。	法中，「一切不斷貪心共生滅」者，有人雖復得定伏貪而未斷除，使性在心故共生滅。	As for the Dharma, all those who have not severed the greedy mind are born and perish together means that although some people have attained concentration and subdued greed, they have not yet eliminated it, and the nature of the afflictions remains in the mind, so they are born and perish together.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a04_1']	次以喻顯，「欲界眾生一切皆有初地味」者，此名初禪以為初地。	次以喻顯，「欲界眾生一切皆有初地味」者，此名初禪以為初地。	Next, using an analogy to illustrate, all beings in the desire realm have the first earth-like concentration means that the first dhyāna is taken as the first stage.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a04_6']	禪有三種：	禪有三種：	There are three kinds of dhyāna:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a04_20']	一者淨禪，所謂上界有漏淨心。	一者淨禪，所謂上界有漏淨心。	The first is pure dhyāna, which refers to the pure and contaminated mind in the upper realms.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a05_9']	二無漏禪，諦理之靜。	二無漏禪，諦理之靜。	The second is the dhyāna without outflows, which is the stillness of the principle of the truths.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a05_19']	三者味禪，分別有三：	三者味禪，分別有三：	The third is the dhyāna of taste, which is distinguished into three:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a07_17']	一就通以論，初禪地中一切煩惱通名味禪，味著境界故名為味，禪地法故，說之為禪；	一就通以論，初禪地中一切煩惱通名味禪，味著境界故名為味，禪地法故，說之為禪；	First, discussing it in terms of the general, all afflictions in the stage of the first dhyāna are collectively called the dhyāna of taste. Because they are attached to objects, it is called taste. Because it is the Dharma of the stage of dhyāna, it is called dhyāna;
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a08_17']	二偏就愛說，愛心著境與定相似，說為味禪；	二偏就愛說，愛心著境與定相似，說為味禪；	Second, speaking specifically about craving, the craving mind is attached to objects, which is similar to concentration, and is called the dhyāna of taste;
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a10_19']	三正論體，為上界中煩惱心邊相應定數是味禪體，故《雜心云》「味為愛相應，味禪如是。	三正論體，為上界中煩惱心邊相應定數是味禪體，故《雜心云》「味為愛相應，味禪如是。	Third, the essence of right discussion is that in the upper realms, the concentration number associated with the side of defiled mind is the essence of enjoyment meditation. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Treatise says: Enjoyment is associated with craving. Enjoyment meditation is like this.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a12_10']	」此之味禪，欲界眾生皆具有之，一切染法味斷已來，在下其必成就上故。	」此之味禪，欲界眾生皆具有之，一切染法味斷已來，在下其必成就上故。	This enjoyment meditation is all possessed by sentient beings in the desire realm. Since the enjoyment of all defiled dharmas has already been cut off, if one is below, one must certainly accomplish the above.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a12_13']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a12_20']	何故偏說味禪？	何故偏說味禪？	Why is it said specifically about enjoyment meditation?
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a14_16']	淨及無漏修習方有，不同味定身在下地，於上地中未斷之處性常成就，故取為喻。	淨及無漏修習方有，不同味定身在下地，於上地中未斷之處性常成就，故取為喻。	Pure and uncontaminated meditation must be cultivated to exist, unlike enjoyment concentration, where the body is below the ground, and in the upper ground, where it has not yet been cut off, the nature is always accomplished, so it is taken as a metaphor.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a14_19']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a15_15']	味禪下皆成上，以何義故偏說初地？	味禪下皆成上，以何義故偏說初地？	Since enjoyment meditation is accomplished below and above, for what meaning is it said specifically about the first ground?
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a16_11']	且舉初地，餘類可知，故略不論。	且舉初地，餘類可知，故略不論。	It is just an example of the first ground, and the rest can be known, so it is not discussed in detail.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a16_14']	又問：	又問：	Also asked:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a17_4']	何故偏說欲界眾生皆有？	何故偏說欲界眾生皆有？	Why is it said specifically that all sentient beings in the desire realm have it?
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a18_12']	欲界眾生望初地味未起而有，似彼貪欲不起而有，故偏舉之。	欲界眾生望初地味未起而有，似彼貪欲不起而有，故偏舉之。	Sentient beings in the desire realm have not yet given rise to craving for the first dhyāna ground, yet it exists. It is similar to the fact that craving for desire has not yet arisen, yet it exists. Therefore, it is mentioned specifically.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a19_12']	在初禪者現起說有，理在易知，何待言論？	在初禪者現起說有，理在易知，何待言論？	Those in the first dhyāna are said to have it when it manifests. The principle is easy to understand, so why wait for discussion?
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a20_6']	二禪已上不成下味，為是不說。	二禪已上不成下味，為是不說。	Those in the second dhyāna and above do not form the taste of the lower [stages], so it is not mentioned.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a21_21']	「若修、不修常成就」者顯前皆有，「遇緣得」者顯前成就，言「因緣」下顯前緣相。	「若修、不修常成就」者顯前皆有，「遇緣得」者顯前成就，言「因緣」下顯前緣相。	Whether cultivated or not, it is always accomplished shows that all the previous [stages] have it. Obtained through encountering conditions shows that the previous [stages] are accomplished. The conditions below shows the characteristics of the previous conditions.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a22_9']	次合、後釋，文皆可知。	次合、後釋，文皆可知。	Next, it is combined and explained. The text is all understandable.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a22_20']	次釋第二，先問、後解。	次釋第二，先問、後解。	Next, the second [stage] is explained. First, it is asked, and then it is explained.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a23_7']	此門約就三人釋之：	此門約就三人釋之：	This gate is explained in terms of three people:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a25_10']	一就聲聞外凡中說，有緣生貪，骨觀治之，名不共滅，此望起惑，若望使性，骨觀不除猶與貪滅；	一就聲聞外凡中說，有緣生貪，骨觀治之，名不共滅，此望起惑，若望使性，骨觀不除猶與貪滅；	First, in the outer and ordinary [stages] of the śrāvakas, there is craving that arises through conditions. The contemplation of bones treats it, and is called the uncommon cessation. This is in terms of the arising of afflictions. If in terms of the nature of the propensities, the contemplation of bones does not eliminate them, yet it is still the cessation of craving;
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a27_7']	二就聲聞內凡上說，煖等已上未證四果有緣生貪，證果時滅，向中亦滅就顯說果；	二就聲聞內凡上說，煖等已上未證四果有緣生貪，證果時滅，向中亦滅就顯說果；	Second, within the śrāvakas, those above the stage of heat and below the realization of the four fruits have craving that arises with conditions, which is extinguished upon realizing the fruits. The fruits are mentioned for the sake of clarity.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816a28_12']	三就不動菩薩釋之，得不動時，心共貪生、不共貪滅。	三就不動菩薩釋之，得不動時，心共貪生、不共貪滅。	Third, it is explained in terms of the immovable bodhisattvas, who when attaining immovability, give rise to the mind together with craving, but extinguish it without craving.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b02_14']	從前七地入八地時名得不動，前七地中有愛佛心名共貪生，八地捨之名不共滅，故《地經》云「佛心、菩提心、涅槃心等一切不行，況世間心」。	從前七地入八地時名得不動，前七地中有愛佛心名共貪生，八地捨之名不共滅，故《地經》云「佛心、菩提心、涅槃心等一切不行，況世間心」。	When entering the eighth ground from the previous seven grounds, it is called attaining immovability. Within the previous seven grounds, there is the mind of loving the Buddha, which is called giving rise to the mind together with craving. Abandoning it in the eighth ground is called extinguishing it without craving. Therefore the Treatise on the Stages says, The mind of the Buddha, the mind of bodhi, the mind of nirvāṇa, and so forth are all non-existent, let alone the worldly mind.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b03_5']	次釋第三，先問、後解。	次釋第三，先問、後解。	Next, the third is explained. First, a question is asked, and then it is explained.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b04_16']	此門唯就菩薩釋之，自無貪愛名「不共生」，隨他現起名「共貪滅」。	此門唯就菩薩釋之，自無貪愛名「不共生」，隨他現起名「共貪滅」。	This approach is explained only in terms of bodhisattvas. Being without craving oneself is called not giving rise to the mind together with craving, while manifesting it according to others is called extinguishing the mind together with craving.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b05_4']	次釋第四，先問、後解。	次釋第四，先問、後解。	Next, the fourth is explained. First, a question is asked, and then it is explained.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b05_13']	此門約就四人釋之：	此門約就四人釋之：	This approach is explained in terms of four types of people:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b06_16']	一就羅漢、二就辟支、三就如來、四除不動就餘菩薩。	一就羅漢、二就辟支、三就如來、四除不動就餘菩薩。	First, in terms of arhats, second, in terms of pratyekabuddhas, third, in terms of tathāgatas, and fourth, excluding the immovable and the rest of the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b07_1', 'ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b10_10']	何故如是？🔽十地菩薩分為三階，初至七地功用之位合為一階，惡貪為過、善貪為治、未說為患，於此位中不善之貪一向不行，故不共生亦不共滅，善貪非患故不說之。	何故如是？ 十地菩薩分為三階，初至七地功用之位合為一階，惡貪為過、善貪為治、未說為患，於此位中不善之貪一向不行，故不共生亦不共滅，善貪非患故不說之。	Why is it so?🔽The bodhisattvas of the ten grounds are divided into three stages. From the first to the seventh grounds, the stage of effort is combined into one stage. Evil craving is the fault, good craving is the remedy. The harm of non-speaking is not mentioned. In this stage, the craving of the unwholesome does not operate in any way, so it is neither born together nor extinguished together. Good craving is not a harm, so it is not mentioned.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b13_11']	八地菩薩獨為一階，善貪為患、無貪為治，於此位中始背善貪未能捨離名共貪生，終能除盡名不共滅，非是一向不共生滅，故今除之。	八地菩薩獨為一階，善貪為患、無貪為治，於此位中始背善貪未能捨離名共貪生，終能除盡名不共滅，非是一向不共生滅，故今除之。	The bodhisattvas of the eighth ground are alone in one stage. Good craving is the harm, non-craving is the remedy. In this stage, they just turn their backs on good craving and are not yet able to abandon it, called born together with craving. In the end, they are able to completely eliminate it, called extinguished separately. It is not a case of being neither born together nor extinguished together, so it is now excluded.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b16_3']	九地已上合為一階，望彼善貪一向全無，是故說為不共生滅，以有是義，故除不動，其餘菩薩悉皆名為不共生滅。	九地已上合為一階，望彼善貪一向全無，是故說為不共生滅，以有是義，故除不動，其餘菩薩悉皆名為不共生滅。	Above the ninth stage, they are combined into one level. Compared to that good craving, they are completely and totally absent. Therefore, it is said to be the uncommon arising and ceasing. Because of this meaning, the unshakable ones are excluded. The remaining bodhisattvas are all called the uncommon arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b16_19']	前略次廣，「以是義」下第三總結。	前略次廣，「以是義」下第三總結。	The previous [part] is brief, and the following [part] is extensive. For this reason is the third concluding summary.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b17_17']	「以是義故，不決定說心有淨性及不淨性」。	「以是義故，不決定說心有淨性及不淨性」。	For this reason, it is not definitively said that the mind has a nature of purity or impurity.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b18_15']	自下第二對前德王本無之執，明非本無。	自下第二對前德王本無之執，明非本無。	Below this, the second [part] is in response to the previous Devadatta's attachment to non-origination, clarifying that it is not originally non-existent.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b20_14']	真識之心本為惑覆，非先無染而不與彼貪結等合，非本無淨，本有染故，所以可脫。	真識之心本為惑覆，非先無染而不與彼貪結等合，非本無淨，本有染故，所以可脫。	The true consciousness mind is originally covered by afflictions. It is not that it was originally undefiled and not united with those bonds of craving, etc. It is not originally pure, because it originally has defilements, and therefore can be liberated.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b20_19']	文中有二：	文中有二：	In the text, there are two [parts]:
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b22_12']	一就凡時明心相染而體性淨、二「諸佛菩薩永破貪」下約就前義明有解脫。	一就凡時明心相染而體性淨、二「諸佛菩薩永破貪」下約就前義明有解脫。	The first, in terms of the ordinary person's time, clarifies that the characteristics of the mind are defiled but its essence is pure. The second, in terms of the previous meaning, clarifies that there is liberation.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b23_2']	前中，初法，次喻，後合。	前中，初法，次喻，後合。	In the former [part], first is the Dharma, next is the analogy, and finally is the combination.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b25_13']	准喻法中，文少不足，若具，應言「是心雖為貪欲、瞋、癡之所覆蔽，而不與彼貪結等合」，文中直明不合便罷，被覆不論。	准喻法中，文少不足，若具，應言「是心雖為貪欲、瞋、癡之所覆蔽，而不與彼貪結等合」，文中直明不合便罷，被覆不論。	In the analogy, the text is abbreviated and incomplete. If complete, it should say Although this mind is covered by greed, anger, and delusion, it does not merge with those bonds of greed, etc. The text directly clarifies non-merging and ends there, not discussing being covered.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b28_5']	喻中，初言「為烟等覆，是以不見」喻前所少，「日月」喻於真心之體，「烟」等喻於貪等諸結，日月雖明而為烟雲塵霧等覆。	喻中，初言「為烟等覆，是以不見」喻前所少，「日月」喻於真心之體，「烟」等喻於貪等諸結，日月雖明而為烟雲塵霧等覆。	In the analogy, first it says Because it is covered by smoke, etc., it is not seen. This illustrates what was previously lacking. The sun and moon are a metaphor for the essence of the true mind, while smoke, etc. are metaphors for the various bonds such as greed. Although the sun and moon are bright, they are covered by smoke, clouds, dust, fog, etc.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816b28_19']	真心如是，性雖清淨而為惑覆。	真心如是，性雖清淨而為惑覆。	The true mind is like this. Although its nature is pure, it is covered by delusions.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816c01_8']	「雖不見」下喻前不與貪結等合，「烟、雲、塵、霧及修羅手」是其五翳。	「雖不見」下喻前不與貪結等合，「烟、雲、塵、霧及修羅手」是其五翳。	Although not seen, etc. illustrates the previous non-merging with the bonds of greed, etc. Smoke, clouds, dust, fog, and the hand of the asura are the five obscurations.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816c03_18']	下合顯法，「心亦如是，以因緣故，生於貪結」合前日月為烟等覆，「眾生雖」下合上日月不與翳合，於中初先正明不合。	下合顯法，「心亦如是，以因緣故，生於貪結」合前日月為烟等覆，「眾生雖」下合上日月不與翳合，於中初先正明不合。	The following passage reveals the Dharma, saying the mind is also like this, because of causes and conditions, it gives rise to the fetter of greed, which corresponds to the previous statement that the sun and moon are covered by smoke, etc. The passage below although sentient beings corresponds to the previous statement that the sun and moon do not merge with the obscurations. Within this, it first clarifies that they do not merge.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816c04_17']	「若是」下釋，「貪即貪性」明妄異真；	「若是」下釋，「貪即貪性」明妄異真；	The passage below if it is explains. Greed is the nature of greed clarifies that delusion is different from truth.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816c05_8']	「不貪即是不貪性」者明真異妄。	「不貪即是不貪性」者明真異妄。	Not greed is the nature of not greed clarifies that truth is different from delusion.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816c06_2']	不貪之心不能作貪，真不作妄；	不貪之心不能作貪，真不作妄；	The mind of not greed cannot create greed, truth does not create delusion;
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816c06_16']	貪結之心不能不貪，妄不作真。	貪結之心不能不貪，妄不作真。	The mind of the fetter of greed cannot be not greed, delusion does not create truth.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0816c08_5']	「以是」下結，此義猶是《勝鬘經》中「自性淨心不染而染、染而不染」。	「以是」下結，此義猶是《勝鬘經》中「自性淨心不染而染、染而不染」。	The passage below for this reason concludes. This meaning is still the naturally pure mind that is not defiled but becomes defiled, and is defiled but not defiled in the Śrīmālā-sūtra.

Those who are adorned with wisdom are the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten grounds. The text is brief, so it simply says bodhisattvas without saying ten grounds.

The Buddha-nature of sentient beings is precisely the Tathāgatagarbha. Within the Tathāgatagarbha, the dharmas of the Buddha's wisdom, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, are extensively prepared. These dharmas of the Buddha are of the same essence and mutually integrate. There is not a single dharma that separately guards its own nature. Therefore, it is said to be empty.

The mind is the nature of enlightenment, and is therefore called wisdom. Therefore, the Huayan Sutra says, In the minds and dust-motes of all sentient beings there is the wisdom without a teacher, the unobstructed wisdom, the vast wisdom, and so forth.

['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825a27_20']	一就破離斷常分別，於事分齊十二因緣次第相生，後藉前起是故非常，前能生後所以非斷，非常、非斷故名為中。	一就破離斷常分別，於事分齊十二因緣次第相生，後藉前起是故非常，前能生後所以非斷，非常、非斷故名為中。	First, in terms of refuting and distinguishing from eternalism and annihilationism, the twelve links of dependent origination arise sequentially in the limited scope of phenomena, and the later relies on the earlier to arise, therefore it is not eternal; the earlier can give rise to the later, therefore it is not annihilation. Because it is neither eternal nor annihilation, it is called the middle.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b01_13']	二破我分別，因緣法中無我、無人，以無我故因緣之法亦非我所則為非有，因緣相生故復非無，非有、非無名為中道。	二破我分別，因緣法中無我、無人，以無我故因緣之法亦非我所則為非有，因緣相生故復非無，非有、非無名為中道。	Second, refuting the discrimination of self. In the Dharma of causes and conditions, there is no self and no person. Because there is no self, the Dharma of causes and conditions is also not mine and thus does not exist. Because the characteristics of causes and conditions arise, it is also not nonexistent. Nonexistence and non-nonexistence is called the middle way.

The Dharma of causes and conditions appears with deceptive characteristics, but when the principle is thoroughly investigated, it is originally nonexistent. Not only is there no nature, but the characteristics are also unobtainable, like the water of a mirage. When observed up close, not only is there no water nature, but the characteristics of water are also nonexistent.

['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b10_11']	以心起故，於理本無，名為非有；	以心起故，於理本無，名為非有；	Because the mind arises, it is originally non-existent in principle, called non-existence;

['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b15_1']	真心即是如來藏性，古今常湛，清淨不變，何有因緣起作可得？	真心即是如來藏性，古今常湛，清淨不變，何有因緣起作可得？	The true mind is precisely the nature of the Tathagata's treasury, eternally tranquil and pure, unchanging from ancient times, how can there be dependent arising and creation to be obtained?
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b15_6']	所以非有。	所以非有。	Therefore it is non-existence.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b15_21']	隨妄流轉，集起生死，說為非無。	隨妄流轉，集起生死，說為非無。	Following the flow of delusion, accumulating and giving rise to birth and death, it is called non-non-existence.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b16_10']	非有、非無，故名中道。	非有、非無，故名中道。	Non-existence and non-non-existence are therefore called the middle way.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b18_4']	又彼真心離性名為非有，體具法界恒沙佛法說為非無，非有、非無名為中道。	又彼真心離性名為非有，體具法界恒沙佛法說為非無，非有、非無名為中道。	Moreover, that true mind, apart from characteristics, is called non-existent. Its essence is endowed with the dharmadhātu and the Buddha-dharmas like the sands of the Ganges, and is said to be not non-existent. Non-existent and not non-existent is called the middle way.
['ZH_T37_1764_008:0825b20_2']	六中，前五虛妄不真，生滅流轉，非是常、樂、我、淨之法，不能究竟為佛真種，今此不論。	六中，前五虛妄不真，生滅流轉，非是常、樂、我、淨之法，不能究竟為佛真種，今此不論。	Among the six, the first five are false and unreal, arising and ceasing, flowing and turning, not being the dharmas of permanence, bliss, self, and purity, and are not ultimately able to be the true seeds of the Buddha. They are not discussed here.
