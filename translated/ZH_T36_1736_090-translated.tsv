Since one has already entered suchness, one does not abide in saṃsāra, and since one also causes others to enter, one does not abide in nirvāṇa.

['ZH_T36_1736_090:0697c13_11']	今云顯佛平等，故廣列諸佛皆相遍耳，豈非妙耶？	今云顯佛平等，故廣列諸佛皆相遍耳，豈非妙耶？	090	Now it is said that it reveals the equality of the buddhas, so it extensively lists the mutual pervasion of the characteristics of all buddhas. How could it not be wonderful?
['ZH_T36_1736_090:0697c15_3']	疏「今更」下，即就佛平等中，顯實是本師互遍，更過平等之意趣耳。	疏「今更」下，即就佛平等中，顯實是本師互遍，更過平等之意趣耳。	090	The commentary below Now, moreover means that within the equality of the buddhas, it reveals that the real is the original teacher's mutual pervasion, and moreover surpasses the meaning and purport of equality.
