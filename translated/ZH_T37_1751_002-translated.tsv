['ZH_T37_1751_002:0201c28_12']	故託他佛而為所緣，然是大乘知心作佛、佛即是心，其觀未成為塵所動。	故託他佛而為所緣，然是大乘知心作佛、佛即是心，其觀未成為塵所動。	So it relies on the Buddha of others as the object of contemplation. However, this is the Mahayana understanding that the mind creates the Buddha, and the Buddha is precisely the mind. The contemplation has not yet been accomplished and is moved by the dust.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0201c29_11']	始自圓聞觀佛妙境，至識次位勤行五悔。	始自圓聞觀佛妙境，至識次位勤行五悔。	Starting from the perfect hearing of the wonderful realm of contemplating the Buddha, up to recognizing the stages and diligently practicing the five repentances.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a01_14']	若未發品，此等行人皆屬名字，故知名字其位甚長。	若未發品，此等行人皆屬名字，故知名字其位甚長。	If the stage has not yet been attained, these practitioners all belong to the stage of name and form. Therefore, it is known that the stage of name and form is very long.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a02_18']	今明對塵即成佛觀，其中念念覺知之心，名觀行佛。	今明對塵即成佛觀，其中念念覺知之心，名觀行佛。	Now, it is explained that the contemplation of becoming a Buddha is accomplished by facing the dust. The mind that is aware of this moment by moment is called the Buddha of contemplation practice.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a03_3']	此自分二：	此自分二：	This is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a03_12']	初、觀妙色即真法。	初、觀妙色即真法。	First, contemplating the wonderful form is precisely the true Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a04_10']	以大小相皆悉周遍，故此色身即是真法。	以大小相皆悉周遍，故此色身即是真法。	Because the large and small characteristics are all pervasive, this form body is precisely the true Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a04_13']	又二；	又二；	There are two parts:
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a04_21']	初、約一佛，二：	初、約一佛，二：	First, about one Buddha, two:
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a05_7']	初、示始習即心觀相。	初、示始習即心觀相。	First, showing the initial practice of observing the mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a06_7']	此是名字昇進之位，不獨解名，能修觀故；	此是名字昇進之位，不獨解名，能修觀故；	This is the stage of progress in names and phrases, not only understanding the names but also being able to cultivate observation;
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a07_1']	但未入品，非觀行位觀佛相者。	但未入品，非觀行位觀佛相者。	But it has not yet entered the category, it is not the stage of observing the Buddha's appearance.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a09_7']	若此經中八萬相好，非羸劣想而可繫緣，故須初心先觀落日，漸觀地樹及以座像，觀既深著方觀勝身。	若此經中八萬相好，非羸劣想而可繫緣，故須初心先觀落日，漸觀地樹及以座像，觀既深著方觀勝身。	If in this sutra the eighty thousand marks and virtues cannot be grasped by weak thoughts, therefore beginners must first observe the setting sun, gradually observe the ground, trees, and seat images, and only observe the supreme body after the observation is deeply attached.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a11_1']	今依《般舟》，初心先觀千輻輪相，次第逆想至肉髻三十二種，是下品相。	今依《般舟》，初心先觀千輻輪相，次第逆想至肉髻三十二種，是下品相。	Now, according to the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra, beginners first observe the mark of the thousand-spoked wheel, and in sequence think of it from the top of the head to the thirty-two kinds of marks, which are the inferior marks.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a12_4']	復從足起，可作始行繫心之境，不須更以落日為緣。	復從足起，可作始行繫心之境，不須更以落日為緣。	Again, starting from the feet, it can be the realm for beginners to focus their minds, and there is no need to take the setting sun as the condition.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a13_7']	若相若好皆依於身，身唯金色，故云「如鑄金像」。	若相若好皆依於身，身唯金色，故云「如鑄金像」。	Whether marks or virtues, they all depend on the body, and the body is only golden in color, therefore it is said like a cast golden image.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a14_8']	此之色相雖從心想如在目前，故云「與眼作對」。	此之色相雖從心想如在目前，故云「與眼作對」。	Although these forms and marks arise from the mind, they are like being in front of one's eyes, therefore it is said to make eye-contact with.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a15_1']	言「妙色」者，即是不可思議色也。	言「妙色」者，即是不可思議色也。	As for wonderful form, it refers to the inconceivable form.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a15_6']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a16_4']	由此行人已圓聞故，知色唯心、知心唯色。	由此行人已圓聞故，知色唯心、知心唯色。	Because this practitioner has already perfected hearing, they know that form is only mind, and they know that mind is only form.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a17_3']	五根所對尚體唯心，況想成色豈在心外？	五根所對尚體唯心，況想成色豈在心外？	The objects perceived by the five sense organs are still only mind in essence, let alone the form accomplished by thought, which is not outside the mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a18_3']	此色非色、非色非非色，而能雙照色與非色。	此色非色、非色非非色，而能雙照色與非色。	This form is neither form nor not form, yet it can illuminate both form and non-form.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a18_13']	既離情想，故名妙色。	既離情想，故名妙色。	Since it is free from conceptual thoughts, it is called wonderful form.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a20_10']	非由三觀莫見妙色、非由妙色莫成三觀，境觀相資塵念靡間，方能得入觀行位也。	非由三觀莫見妙色、非由妙色莫成三觀，境觀相資塵念靡間，方能得入觀行位也。	Without the three contemplations, one cannot see the wonderful form; without the wonderful form, one cannot accomplish the three contemplations. The contemplations and objects mutually support each other, and thoughts are uninterrupted, only then can one enter the stage of contemplation and practice.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a21_3']	二、「開眼」下，明觀成稱性周遍。	二、「開眼」下，明觀成稱性周遍。	Second, below opening the eyes, it clarifies that the contemplation is accomplished and pervades the nature.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a23_21']	妙心作相、妙相發心，心心不休成觀入品，塵緣莫動佛常現前，閉目了然、開眼不失，在明見佛、處暗不忘，性無間然，佛豈暫闕？	妙心作相、妙相發心，心心不休成觀入品，塵緣莫動佛常現前，閉目了然、開眼不失，在明見佛、處暗不忘，性無間然，佛豈暫闕？	The wondrous mind creates the characteristics, and the wondrous characteristics give rise to the mind. Mind after mind unceasingly forms the contemplation and enters the stage. Dust conditions cannot move, and the Buddha is always present. Closing the eyes, one clearly sees; opening the eyes, one does not lose [the Buddha]. In the light, one sees the Buddha; in the dark, one does not forget. The nature is uninterrupted, so how could the Buddha be absent for a moment?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a25_7']	一一相海莊嚴法身，相為大相、好為小相，觀大發小名為流出。	一一相海莊嚴法身，相為大相、好為小相，觀大發小名為流出。	Each of the oceans of characteristics adorns the Dharma body. The characteristics are the great characteristics, and the minor marks are the small characteristics. Contemplating the great gives rise to the small, which is called flowing out.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a26_15']	劫水雖大，止劑二禪，佛相遍周稱於法界，且以分喻顯於周遍。	劫水雖大，止劑二禪，佛相遍周稱於法界，且以分喻顯於周遍。	Although the waters of the kalpa are great, they only reach the second dhyana heaven. The Buddha's characteristics pervade and encompass the Dharma realm. For now, a partial analogy is used to illustrate the all-pervasiveness.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a27_14']	觀行佛眼名曰周眸，此眼所觀何處非佛。	觀行佛眼名曰周眸，此眼所觀何處非佛。	The Buddha eye of contemplation is called the all-seeing eye. In whatever place this eye observes, there is no place that is not the Buddha.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202a29_6']	《金光明玄義》觀於三道顯金光明，似位尚云閉目則見、開目則失。	《金光明玄義》觀於三道顯金光明，似位尚云閉目則見、開目則失。	The Profound Meaning of the Golden Light Sutra manifests the golden light through contemplating the three paths. Even in the semblance stage, it is said that closing the eyes one sees, but opening the eyes one loses [the vision].
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b01_4']	今觀三身位在觀行，因何開閉俱得見邪？	今觀三身位在觀行，因何開閉俱得見邪？	Now, contemplating the three bodies is in the stage of contemplation practice. Why is it that both with eyes open and closed one can see?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b01_6']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b02_13']	彼明性德金光明理，此理初住方任運見，故於似位猶論得失。	彼明性德金光明理，此理初住方任運見，故於似位猶論得失。	That clarifies the principle of the golden light of inherent enlightened nature. This principle is only seen spontaneously in the initial stage of residence, so in the stage of resemblance, success and failure are still discussed.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b05_5']	今帶事定，託彼應色觀於三身，以其應相凡心可見，故理三身雖乃未顯，不妨應色先與定合，故令開閉皆見佛身。	今帶事定，託彼應色觀於三身，以其應相凡心可見，故理三身雖乃未顯，不妨應色先與定合，故令開閉皆見佛身。	Now, with the practice of samādhi, relying on that responsive form, one contemplates the three bodies. Since the responsive characteristics can be seen by ordinary minds, therefore, although the principle of the three bodies is not yet manifested, it does not prevent the responsive form from first combining with samādhi. Thus, it causes opening and closing to both see the Buddha's body.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b06_8']	如以三觀觀彼落日，三觀未成而能開閉皆見於日。	如以三觀觀彼落日，三觀未成而能開閉皆見於日。	It is like using the three contemplations to contemplate the setting sun. Although the three contemplations are not yet accomplished, one can still open and close to see the sun.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b07_16']	故雖事理一念同修，而理難事易，事易故先現、理難故後發。	故雖事理一念同修，而理難事易，事易故先現、理難故後發。	Therefore, although the principle and phenomena are cultivated together in a single thought, the principle is difficult and the phenomena are easy. Since the phenomena are easy, they appear first; since the principle is difficult, it manifests later.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b09_1']	故般舟三昧以三十二相為事境，以即空假中為理觀。	故般舟三昧以三十二相為事境，以即空假中為理觀。	Therefore, the pratyutpanna samādhi takes the thirty-two marks as the phenomenal realm and takes emptiness, conventionality, and the Middle as the principle contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b09_15']	境觀雖乃同時而修，境必先成；	境觀雖乃同時而修，境必先成；	Although the realm and contemplation are cultivated simultaneously, the realm must be formed first;
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b10_14']	託境進觀、藉觀顯境，更進更顯，從凡入聖。	託境進觀、藉觀顯境，更進更顯，從凡入聖。	Relying on the realm to advance contemplation, using contemplation to manifest the realm, further advancing and further manifesting, entering from ordinary to sagehood.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b11_14']	故知彼就趣真無住，對似愛頂墮為開閉得失。	故知彼就趣真無住，對似愛頂墮為開閉得失。	Therefore, we know that they are discussing the opening and closing, gain and loss, of entering the truth without abiding, and falling into the peak of existence like love.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b12_4']	此就應色，得成觀行。	此就應色，得成觀行。	This is discussing the attainment of contemplation practice in response to form.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b13_8']	為開閉俱見，不知事理難易淺深，此相違文何能銷釋？	為開閉俱見，不知事理難易淺深，此相違文何能銷釋？	It is opening and closing the simultaneous view, not knowing the difficulty and ease, shallow and deep, of principle and phenomena. How can these contradictory passages be explained?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b13_22']	二、「念一」下，等諸佛，二：	二、「念一」下，等諸佛，二：	Second, from contemplating one below, it is equal to all Buddhas, in two parts:
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b14_6']	初、約一佛等諸佛。	初、約一佛等諸佛。	First, about one Buddha being equal to all Buddhas.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b15_5']	為成觀故不可散緣，故以彌陀一佛為境。	為成觀故不可散緣，故以彌陀一佛為境。	In order to accomplish contemplation, one cannot scatter the conditions, so one takes Amitâbha Buddha as the object.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b15_15']	雖觀一佛，何異十方；	雖觀一佛，何異十方；	Although contemplating one Buddha, how is it different from the ten directions?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b16_4']	雖照現今，何殊過未？	雖照現今，何殊過未？	Although illuminating the present, how is it different from the past and future?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b17_13']	此彰一切不離彌陀，良以彌陀是無量之一，故能等於一中無量。	此彰一切不離彌陀，良以彌陀是無量之一，故能等於一中無量。	This shows that all is not apart from Amitâbha. This is because Amitâbha is one of the immeasurable, and thus can be equal to the immeasurable within one.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b18_5']	二、「一身」下，明諸佛同三法。	二、「一身」下，明諸佛同三法。	Second, from one body below, it clarifies that all Buddhas are the same in three dharmas.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b19_4']	「一佛等彼一切佛」者，以由佛佛同得三法：	「一佛等彼一切佛」者，以由佛佛同得三法：	One Buddha is equal to all those Buddhas is because Buddha after Buddha is the same in attaining three dharmas:
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b20_14']	身是法身、智慧是般若、十力四無所畏是解脫，亦是三身三涅槃等。	身是法身、智慧是般若、十力四無所畏是解脫，亦是三身三涅槃等。	The body is the Dharma body, wisdom is prajñā, the ten powers and four fearlessnesses are liberation, and they are also the three bodies, three nirvāṇas, etc.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b22_10']	身智言一者，顯於諸佛法報不別，應用亦同，故力無畏結云亦然，同身智一也。	身智言一者，顯於諸佛法報不別，應用亦同，故力無畏結云亦然，同身智一也。	The statement that the body and wisdom are one shows that the Dharma and reward bodies of all buddhas are not separate, and their applications are also the same. Therefore, the powers and fearlessnesses are concluded to be the same, being the same as the one body and wisdom.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b24_3']	菩薩因中分破無明，分同妙覺所證三法，無明破盡，則究竟同諸佛三法。	菩薩因中分破無明，分同妙覺所證三法，無明破盡，則究竟同諸佛三法。	Bodhisattvas, while on the causal ground, partially destroy ignorance and partially share in the realization of the three dharmas of wondrous enlightenment. When ignorance is completely destroyed, they ultimately share in the three dharmas of all buddhas.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b25_16']	諸佛三法既其不二，是故彌陀三法不少、一切諸佛三法不多，故言等也。	諸佛三法既其不二，是故彌陀三法不少、一切諸佛三法不多，故言等也。	Since the three dharmas of all buddhas are non-dual, therefore the three dharmas of Amitâbha are not few, and the three dharmas of all buddhas are not many. Thus it is said to be equal.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b26_8']	二、「念色」下，念三身以結示。	二、「念色」下，念三身以結示。	Second, below contemplating the form, it concludes by showing the contemplation of the three bodies.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202b27_2']	色是應身，通於勝劣及他受用。	色是應身，通於勝劣及他受用。	Form is the responsive body, which extends to the superior, the inferior, and the enjoyment of others.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c02_5']	法門是報身，以諸法門聚而為身，即八萬四千陀羅尼為髮、第一義諦為髻、種智為頭、慈悲為眼、無漏為鼻、四辯為口、四十不共為齒、二智為手、如來藏為復、三三昧為腰、定慧為足等。	法門是報身，以諸法門聚而為身，即八萬四千陀羅尼為髮、第一義諦為髻、種智為頭、慈悲為眼、無漏為鼻、四辯為口、四十不共為齒、二智為手、如來藏為復、三三昧為腰、定慧為足等。	The Dharma gates are the reward body, taking the aggregation of various Dharma gates as the body, with the eighty-four thousand dhāraṇīs as the hair, the ultimate truth as the topknot, the perfect enlightenment as the head, kindness and compassion as the eyes, the uncontaminated as the nose, the four unobstructed [abilities] as the mouth, the forty unique [qualities of a buddha] as the teeth, the two kinds of knowledge as the hands, the tathāgatagarbha as the chest, the three samādhis as the waist, samādhi and prajñā as the feet, and so forth.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c03_13']	此諸法門，若從所證名為法身，今從能證名為報身，自受用也。	此諸法門，若從所證名為法身，今從能證名為報身，自受用也。	These Dharma gates, if from what is realized, are called the Dharma body. Now, from what can realize, they are called the reward body, which is the enjoyment for oneself.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c05_3']	實相是法身，非不具於一切法門及諸色相，讓於能證及垂應故。	實相是法身，非不具於一切法門及諸色相，讓於能證及垂應故。	The true reality is the Dharma body, not lacking in all the Dharma gates and various forms and appearances, yielding to what can realize and what can manifest.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c05_17']	今是所證及以能垂，但名實相；	今是所證及以能垂，但名實相；	Now, this is what is realized and what can manifest, only called the true reality;
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c07_1']	前論觀法，文中但言相好周遍，次文乃約三法論等。	前論觀法，文中但言相好周遍，次文乃約三法論等。	In the previous discussion of the contemplation of dharmas, the text only speaks of the perfect and complete major and minor marks, and the next text discusses the equality in terms of the three dharmas.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c09_3']	至今結示云念三身，應知法門及以實相不離色身，舉一即三、全三是一，法爾相即，非縱非橫。	至今結示云念三身，應知法門及以實相不離色身，舉一即三、全三是一，法爾相即，非縱非橫。	Now, the conclusion states contemplate the three bodies. One should know that the Dharma gates and true aspects are not apart from the form body. Taking one is the three, and the three are entirely one. The Dharma is spontaneously identical, neither vertical nor horizontal.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c10_2']	是故此經第九佛觀，經示相好，疏名真法。	是故此經第九佛觀，經示相好，疏名真法。	Therefore, in the ninth Buddha contemplation of this sutra, the sutra shows the excellent characteristics, and the commentary calls it the true Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c10_12']	不知圓觀，此名莫消？	不知圓觀，此名莫消？	If one does not know the perfect contemplation, this name cannot be resolved?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c11_12']	若觀佛身，不涉後二，便同小外，何預妙宗？	若觀佛身，不涉後二，便同小外，何預妙宗？	If one contemplates the Buddha's body without involving the latter two, it is the same as the small and external. How is it related to the wondrous ultimate?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c12_10']	須知此文，是結前觀色相周遍，已具三身。	須知此文，是結前觀色相周遍，已具三身。	One must know that this text concludes the contemplation of the form characteristics as being all-pervading and already possessing the three bodies.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c14_6']	觀行位人，一切時處，念佛三觀常得現前，故云「無不念時」。	觀行位人，一切時處，念佛三觀常得現前，故云「無不念時」。	The person in the stage of contemplating practices should always, in all times and places, contemplate the Buddha with the three contemplations constantly present before them. Therefore, it says there is no time when not contemplating.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c14_20']	言「念念皆覺」者，示即佛義。	言「念念皆覺」者，示即佛義。	As for each thought is enlightenment, it shows the meaning of being identical to the Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c15_16']	雖是始覺，即同本覺，非全本覺，觀不名中。	雖是始覺，即同本覺，非全本覺，觀不名中。	Although it is initial enlightenment, it is the same as original enlightenment. If it is not entirely original enlightenment, the contemplation is not called the middle.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0202c17_3']	亦得義論始本一合，雖非究竟及真似合，而亦得是觀行合也。	亦得義論始本一合，雖非究竟及真似合，而亦得是觀行合也。	It can also be said that the provisional and ultimate are one, although it is not the ultimate or true and provisional union, it can still be said to be the union of contemplation and practice.

Therefore, we know that now establishing the three contemplations to explain the contemplation is precisely the essence of the sixteen contemplations in the sutra text.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0205c12_7']	若就十六各各示於三觀相者，其文繁廣，故於釋題總而示之，令其修者以茲觀法入十六門，則境境皆三、心心絕妙。	若就十六各各示於三觀相者，其文繁廣，故於釋題總而示之，令其修者以茲觀法入十六門，則境境皆三、心心絕妙。	If we explain the three contemplations in each of the sixteen [gates], the text will be too extensive. Therefore, in the commentary on the title, we generally point them out, allowing practitioners to use this contemplation method to enter the sixteen gates, so that each object is the three, and each thought is utterly wondrous.

Contemplating emptiness is to create the expedient of entering the middle. Therefore, one does not abide in the realization of the wisdom of emptiness. The afflictions and attachments of the three realms must be emptied. The causes and conditions of all dharmas must be thoroughly investigated from beginning to end. The number of views and thoughts is like dust or sand. With a mind of great compassion, one universally contemplates and universally studies. This is called knowing the illness.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a03_4']	諸法諸門破性破相，一一對治無不諳練，是名識藥。	諸法諸門破性破相，一一對治無不諳練，是名識藥。	All dharmas and all gates break down nature and characteristics. Each and every countermeasure is well understood. This is called knowing the medicine.

Supernatural powers startle and move. Wisdom and eloquence proclaim. The four kinds of samādhi should be suitable for each to gain benefits. Giving medicine like this, they are willing to take and practice it.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a06_1']	皆由證空能入此假，故此觀名從空入假。	皆由證空能入此假，故此觀名從空入假。	All of this is because realizing emptiness can enter this conventionality. Therefore, this contemplation is called entering the conventional from emptiness.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a07_4']	而言等者，前除見愛破假用空，今遣塵沙破空用假。	而言等者，前除見愛破假用空，今遣塵沙破空用假。	As for and so on, previously eliminating views and love broke the conventional and used emptiness. Now dispelling dust and sand breaks emptiness and uses conventionality.

If one relies on the Treatise on the Mahāyāna, using the person of the bodhisattva to correspond with the knowledge of the species of the path, it is the fruition of the contemplation of conventionality, and the stage is in the ten practices.

Following the path of teaching, it is called only the middle, only good and pure, not endowed with defilement and evil.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a15_14']	雖無染惡，其性靈知，強覺忽生境界斯現，分別境相執著我人，不昧之知、邪思邪見，現前染惡既非性具，皆是隨緣變造而有。	雖無染惡，其性靈知，強覺忽生境界斯現，分別境相執著我人，不昧之知、邪思邪見，現前染惡既非性具，皆是隨緣變造而有。	Although there is no defilement and evil, its nature is spiritual knowledge. Strong awareness suddenly arises, and the realm appears. Distinguishing the characteristics of the realm, clinging to self and person, the knowledge of the undimmed, and the wrong thoughts and wrong views, the present defilement and evil are not originally endowed, but all arise from the transformation according to conditions.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a17_16']	是變造故非性本然，是故見思不即中道，定須破故，即義不成，故不得云唯愛唯見唯色唯香。	是變造故非性本然，是故見思不即中道，定須破故，即義不成，故不得云唯愛唯見唯色唯香。	Because it is transformed and created, it is not the nature of the original nature. Therefore, the views and thoughts are not identical with the middle way, and must be broken through. The meaning of identity is not established, so it cannot be said that it is only love, only views, only form, or only smell.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a18_18']	設欲修中，能所不絕，故修空為正、中觀為傍。	設欲修中，能所不絕，故修空為正、中觀為傍。	Even if one wants to cultivate the middle way, the subject and object are not severed, so the cultivation of emptiness is the main practice, and the contemplation of the middle way is the auxiliary practice.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a19_13']	心既著有，須別緣空破茲愛見。	心既著有，須別緣空破茲愛見。	Since the mind is attached to existence, one must rely on emptiness to break through this love and views.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a21_6']	所觀之空是二乘法，既非性具乃是別修，空非畢竟，是故空觀但空生死。	所觀之空是二乘法，既非性具乃是別修，空非畢竟，是故空觀但空生死。	The emptiness that is contemplated is the Dharma of the two vehicles. Since it is not the nature of completeness, it is a separate cultivation. Emptiness is not ultimate, so the contemplation of emptiness only empties birth and death.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a22_17']	「次觀空涅槃」者，生死之有雖已破除，心又著空，須別緣假破此空著。	「次觀空涅槃」者，生死之有雖已破除，心又著空，須別緣假破此空著。	Next, contemplate the emptiness of nirvana means that although the existence of birth and death has already been eliminated, the mind is again attached to emptiness. One must rely on the provisional to break through this attachment to emptiness.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a24_5']	假是建立、是菩薩法，非性具故亦是別修，能蕩空著名空涅槃。	假是建立、是菩薩法，非性具故亦是別修，能蕩空著名空涅槃。	The provisional is establishment, which is the Dharma of bodhisattvas. Since it is not the nature of completeness, it is also a separate cultivation. It can sweep away the attachment to emptiness and is called the emptiness of nirvana.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a24_22']	「此之」等者，前空生死，見思惑忘；	「此之」等者，前空生死，見思惑忘；	This and so on means that the previous emptiness of birth and death makes the delusions of views and thoughts disappear;
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a25_9']	次空涅槃，塵沙惑盡。	次空涅槃，塵沙惑盡。	Next, the emptiness of nirvana, with the exhaustion of the dust-like delusions.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a26_7']	二惑既盡，心無偏著，是故得為雙遮方便。	二惑既盡，心無偏著，是故得為雙遮方便。	When the two delusions are exhausted, the mind is without biased attachment, and therefore it becomes the expedient of the double negation.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206a27_15']	「初觀」等者，復因次第用於二觀觀其二諦，是故得為雙照方便。	「初觀」等者，復因次第用於二觀觀其二諦，是故得為雙照方便。	First contemplation and so forth means again using the two contemplations in sequence to contemplate the two truths, and therefore it becomes the expedient of the double illumination.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206b01_16']	方便立已圓觀可修，於十向中即以所顯中道佛性而為能觀中道之觀，諦觀不二惑智一如，三觀圓融是無作行，故得自然入薩婆若。	方便立已圓觀可修，於十向中即以所顯中道佛性而為能觀中道之觀，諦觀不二惑智一如，三觀圓融是無作行，故得自然入薩婆若。	Once the expedients are established, the perfect contemplation can be cultivated. Within the ten directions, it takes the middle way Buddha-nature that is revealed as the contemplation of the middle way, contemplating the non-duality of the truths and the oneness of delusion and wisdom, with the three contemplations perfectly integrated, which is the practice without fabrication, and thus one naturally enters into omniscience.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206b02_12']	此觀之果名一切種智，位在初地。	此觀之果名一切種智，位在初地。	The fruit of this contemplation is called the wisdom of all modes, and the stage is the first ground.

The three are not independent, each one is perfectly complete. Mentioning one is already three. The three virtues are taken as the three truths. Prajñā is the true, liberation is the conventional, and the Dharma body is the middle.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206b07_9']	德既不縱不橫，諦乃絕思絕議，此是佛之所諦。	德既不縱不橫，諦乃絕思絕議，此是佛之所諦。	Since the virtues are neither vertical nor horizontal, the truths are beyond thought and beyond discussion. This is what the Buddha realized.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206b08_12']	今以此諦而為所觀，諦既即一而三，觀豈前後而照？	今以此諦而為所觀，諦既即一而三，觀豈前後而照？	Now, using this truth as the object of contemplation, since the truth is identical to the one with three, how can the contemplation be illuminated sequentially?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206b09_11']	故依妙諦以立觀門，即於一心而修三觀。	故依妙諦以立觀門，即於一心而修三觀。	Therefore, based on the wondrous truth, the gate of contemplation is established, and the three contemplations are cultivated in one mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0206b11_15']	此觀觀法能所雙絕，況無量壽佛本修此觀成就三身，法報泯然、真應融即，非茲妙觀寧顯妙身？	此觀觀法能所雙絕，況無量壽佛本修此觀成就三身，法報泯然、真應融即，非茲妙觀寧顯妙身？	This contemplation of dharmas is completely devoid of subject and object. Moreover, the Buddha of Immeasurable Life originally cultivated this contemplation and accomplished the three bodies. The Dharma and reward bodies are merged, and the true and response bodies are fused. If it were not for this wondrous contemplation, how could the wondrous body be revealed?

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b13_1']	通則生佛俱軌法性，然其九界雖軌而違，如人依師不順師教；	通則生佛俱軌法性，然其九界雖軌而違，如人依師不順師教；	In general, both sentient beings and Buddhas follow the Dharma nature, but although the nine realms follow it, they go against it, like a person relying on a teacher but not following the teacher's teachings;
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b14_4']	唯有諸佛從初發心軌法而修，今能究竟冥合法性。	唯有諸佛從初發心軌法而修，今能究竟冥合法性。	Only the Buddhas, from their initial resolve, follow the Dharma and cultivate it, and now they can ultimately merge with the Dharma nature.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b15_3']	故《大經》云「諸佛所師，所謂法也，以法常故。	故《大經》云「諸佛所師，所謂法也，以法常故。	Therefore the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, The teacher of the Buddhas is the Dharma, because the Dharma is eternal.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b15_18']	」諸佛亦常順法性故，名法為師。	」諸佛亦常順法性故，名法為師。	The Buddhas are also always in accordance with the Dharma nature, so they call the Dharma their teacher.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b16_16']	實非所師與能體別，故即所師法而為其身。	實非所師與能體別，故即所師法而為其身。	It is not really what is taught, and the essence of what can be taught is different, so it is the Dharma that is taught that becomes its body.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b17_16']	雖名為身，已出五陰，故非色質及非心智。	雖名為身，已出五陰，故非色質及非心智。	Although it is called a body, it has already transcended the five aggregates, so it is not a physical form or mind and cognition.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b19_5']	色是初陰、心智即四陰，既其非陰亦非入界，故非三科任持攝屬。	色是初陰、心智即四陰，既其非陰亦非入界，故非三科任持攝屬。	Form is the first aggregate, and mind and cognition are the four aggregates. Since it is neither an aggregate, nor an entrance, nor a realm, it is not held or included in the three categories.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b20_4']	此則已簡分段變易，以示生死陰等攝故。	此則已簡分段變易，以示生死陰等攝故。	This then has already distinguished the conditioned and unconditioned, showing that they are included in the aggregates of birth and death, etc.

Since it is not like these, how can it be characterized?
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b22_4']	為物機故，強指法性名為法身。	為物機故，強指法性名為法身。	For the sake of the capacities of beings, it forcefully points to the Dharma-nature and calls it the Dharma-body.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b22_24']	連持之壽，親依命根。	連持之壽，親依命根。	The life span of continuous support is closely based on the faculty of life.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b24_3']	今法性壽，非識息煖報得命根，亦非三事連持之壽。	今法性壽，非識息煖報得命根，亦非三事連持之壽。	Now, the Dharma-nature life span is not the life faculty obtained through consciousness, breath, or heat, nor is it the life span of continuous support through the three things.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b25_7']	為物顯德，乃指法性非八相遷、非九世易，強名為壽。	為物顯德，乃指法性非八相遷、非九世易，強名為壽。	In order to manifest the virtues for beings, it forcefully points to the Dharma-nature, which is not changed by the eight appearances or altered by the nine times, and forcefully calls it the life span.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b25_17']	三、「此壽」下，量。	三、「此壽」下，量。	Third, below this life span, is the measure.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b26_6']	壽之分量，合論長短及以延促。	壽之分量，合論長短及以延促。	The measure of the life span combines the discussion of long and short, as well as extended and shortened.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b27_6']	今法性壽，實無此等分量之相，此則通簡。	今法性壽，實無此等分量之相，此則通簡。	Now, the Dharma-nature life span is truly without the characteristics of such a measured aspect, this then generally distinguishes.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b28_8']	若別簡者，長是報佛、短是眾生，能延能促即是應身。	若別簡者，長是報佛、短是眾生，能延能促即是應身。	If distinguished separately, long is the reward Buddha, short is sentient beings, and being able to extend and contract is the responsive body.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b29_7']	非此等量，為成觀故，強指法壽同虛空量。	非此等量，為成觀故，強指法壽同虛空量。	Not being of these measurements, in order to accomplish the contemplation, one forcefully points to the Dharma lifespan as being the same as the immeasurable space.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207b29_18']	二、「此即」下，總示。	二、「此即」下，總示。	Second, below this is, it is generally shown.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207c02_12']	法性三義，非陰聚身、非報得壽、非長短量，不可思議，強於法性說身說壽說量故也。	法性三義，非陰聚身、非報得壽、非長短量，不可思議，強於法性說身說壽說量故也。	The three meanings of the Dharma nature are not the body of aggregated skandhas, not the lifespan obtained through retribution, and not long or short measurements. It is inconceivable, and one forcefully speaks of the body, lifespan, and measurements in the Dharma nature.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207c06_24']	二、「如如」下，釋相。	二、「如如」下，釋相。	Second, suchness and below explains the characteristics.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207c11_16']	智慧名通，故以果覺菩提簡之，即是無上菩提之智與法性境相應相冥。	智慧名通，故以果覺菩提簡之，即是無上菩提之智與法性境相應相冥。	The name wisdom is common, so it is distinguished by the fruition enlightenment bodhi, which is the cognition of unsurpassed bodhi corresponding and merging with the dharma-nature object.

Fearing that although the box and cover may match in size, they still retain two appearances, it further uses the analogy of water and milk to illustrate their merging, causing one to know that the original and beginning are the same as the nature of enlightenment.
['ZH_T37_1751_002:0207c15_4']	其體泯然，正同水乳，則顯境外無智、智外無境。	其體泯然，正同水乳，則顯境外無智、智外無境。	Its essence is completely extinguished, exactly the same as water and milk, revealing that there is no cognition outside of objects, and no objects outside of cognition.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0208a19_18']	所見佛相雖小優降，然匪生身，悉是報佛。	所見佛相雖小優降，然匪生身，悉是報佛。	Although the appearance of the Buddha they see is slightly inferior, it is not a born body, but all of it is the reward body of the Buddha.

['ZH_T37_1751_002:0208a23_4']	故《法華》明常在靈山，《華嚴》說法盡未來際，及諸大乘即於應相見是法性尊特之身，故知常身遍應三土。	故《法華》明常在靈山，《華嚴》說法盡未來際，及諸大乘即於應相見是法性尊特之身，故知常身遍應三土。	Therefore, the Lotus Sūtra says that the Buddha always abides on Vulture Peak, and the Flower Ornament Sūtra says that he expounds the Dharma until the end of the future. The various Mahāyāna sūtras show that within the appearance of the responsive body, one sees the body of the Dharma nature of the Tathāgata. Therefore, we know that the eternal body universally responds to the three lands.
