['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009b25_2']	或有說者，欲界中不善根強、善根弱，是故無道能斷蓋制纏；	或有說者，欲界中不善根強、善根弱，是故無道能斷蓋制纏；	Some say that in the desire realm, unwholesome roots are strong and wholesome roots are weak, so there is no path that can eliminate the hindrances and fetters;

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009b28_13']	色界善根如舊住、無不善，是故有道。	色界善根如舊住、無不善，是故有道。	in the form realm, wholesome roots are like old residents and there are no unwholesome roots, so there is a path.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009b29_12']	復有說者，欲界善不善同一繫縛，是故無道；	復有說者，欲界善不善同一繫縛，是故無道；	Again, some say that in the desire realm, wholesome and unwholesome are bound together, so there is no path;
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c02_3']	色界善根、欲界不善根不同繫縛，是以色界道能斷欲界蓋制纏。	色界善根、欲界不善根不同繫縛，是以色界道能斷欲界蓋制纏。	in the form realm, wholesome roots and unwholesome roots of the desire realm are not bound together, so the path of the form realm can eliminate the hindrances and fetters of the desire realm.

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c05_17']	色界有慚愧，如王不與旃陀羅交。	色界有慚愧，如王不與旃陀羅交。	the form realm has shame and conscience, like a king not interacting with an outcaste.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c07_5']	復有說者，欲界愛結愛欲界善根，以愛善根故不能生厭離想；	復有說者，欲界愛結愛欲界善根，以愛善根故不能生厭離想；	There is also an explanation that in the desire realm, the knot of craving craves the wholesome roots of the desire realm, and because of craving the wholesome roots, one is unable to give rise to the thought of renunciation;
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c08_7']	欲界愛不能愛色界善根，以不愛故能生厭離想。	欲界愛不能愛色界善根，以不愛故能生厭離想。	the craving of the desire realm is unable to crave the wholesome roots of the form realm, and because of not craving them, one is able to give rise to the thought of renunciation.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c09_17']	以如是等因緣故，欲界中無道能斷蓋制纏，色界有道能斷蓋制纏。	以如是等因緣故，欲界中無道能斷蓋制纏，色界有道能斷蓋制纏。	For these and other such reasons, in the desire realm there is no path that can sever the hindrances and subdue the entanglements, but in the form realm there is a path that can sever the hindrances and subdue the entanglements.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c10_13']	或有說者，言斷蓋者，是究竟斷；	或有說者，言斷蓋者，是究竟斷；	There is also an explanation that says that to sever the hindrances is to sever them completely;
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c11_8']	制伏諸纏不現前行者，是須臾斷。	制伏諸纏不現前行者，是須臾斷。	to subdue the entanglements and prevent their manifestation is to sever them temporarily.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c12_15']	如究竟、須臾斷，如是有縛無縛、有影無影、有片無片亦如是。	如究竟、須臾斷，如是有縛無縛、有影無影、有片無片亦如是。	Just as there is complete severing and temporary severing, so too is there being bound and being unbound, having a shadow and not having a shadow, having a piece and not having a piece.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c14_4']	復有說者，言斷蓋者害其根本，言制伏不現前行者是制伏諸纏。	復有說者，言斷蓋者害其根本，言制伏不現前行者是制伏諸纏。	There is another explanation: those who eliminate hindrances destroy their roots, while those who restrain and subdue them so that they do not manifest are restraining and subduing the entanglements.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c15_11']	復有說者，言斷蓋者拔諸煩惱，制伏不現前行者是制伏諸纏。	復有說者，言斷蓋者拔諸煩惱，制伏不現前行者是制伏諸纏。	There is another explanation: those who eliminate hindrances uproot the afflictions, while those who restrain and subdue them so that they do not manifest are restraining and subduing the entanglements.

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c17_1']	欲界中雖無究竟斷蓋制纏道，可無須臾斷蓋制纏道耶？	欲界中雖無究竟斷蓋制纏道，可無須臾斷蓋制纏道耶？	Although there is no path in the desire realm that ultimately eliminates hindrances and subdues entanglements, could there be a path that temporarily eliminates hindrances and subdues entanglements?

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c18_9']	不堅牢、不久住、不相續、不相著。	不堅牢、不久住、不相續、不相著。	Because it is not firm, does not last long, does not continue, and does not adhere.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c19_5']	不久住心中，不能久伏煩惱得正決定。	不久住心中，不能久伏煩惱得正決定。	In a mind that does not last long, one cannot long subdue the afflictions and attain right determination.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c20_12']	猶如水上浮萍以小石投之，雖散隨合，蝦蟆入中數散數合。	猶如水上浮萍以小石投之，雖散隨合，蝦蟆入中數散數合。	It is like floating duckweed on water, which scatters when struck by a small stone but then comes together again, or like a frog entering the duckweed and causing it to scatter again and again.

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c22_1']	色界斷道可信。	色界斷道可信。	The path of elimination in the form realm is reliable.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c22_5']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is this?
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c22_17']	牢固、久住、相續、相著。	牢固、久住、相續、相著。	Firm, long-lasting, continuous, and attached.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c23_8']	久住心中能制伏煩惱得正決定。	久住心中能制伏煩惱得正決定。	Long-lasting in the mind, able to subdue afflictions and attain right determination.

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c26_1']	有如是等緣，是故色界道能拔諸蓋制纏害，諸煩惱制伏不行。	有如是等緣，是故色界道能拔諸蓋制纏害，諸煩惱制伏不行。	There are such conditions, therefore the path of the form realm can pull out the covers, subdue the afflictions, and restrain the afflictions from arising.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c27_4']	問曰，若然者，如汝所說，世第一法應唯在未至禪。	問曰，若然者，如汝所說，世第一法應唯在未至禪。	If it is so, as you have said, the supreme worldly dharmas should only be in the preliminary concentration.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c27_9']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it so?

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c28_16']	答曰：	答曰：	The answer is:
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c29_2']	對治有二種：	對治有二種：	There are two kinds of antidotes:
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c29_8']	一、斷對治；	一、斷對治；	First, the antidote of cutting off;
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0009c29_15']	二、過患對治。	二、過患對治。	Second, the antidote of harm.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a01_10']	若依未至禪斷欲界欲，有二種對治道；	若依未至禪斷欲界欲，有二種對治道；	If one relies on the preliminary concentration to cut off the desires of the desire realm, there are two kinds of antidotes;
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a02_5']	餘上地雖無斷對治，有過患對治。	餘上地雖無斷對治，有過患對治。	Although the other higher stages do not have the antidote of cutting off, they have the antidote of harm.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a02_12']	尊者瞿沙說曰：	尊者瞿沙說曰：	Venerable Ghoṣa said:
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a03_19']	六地中盡有斷欲界欲二種對治道，所謂斷對治、過患對治。	六地中盡有斷欲界欲二種對治道，所謂斷對治、過患對治。	In the six stages, there is the path of two kinds of antidotes to the desire realm: the antidote of elimination and the antidote of danger.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a04_3']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a05_7']	依未至禪斷欲界欲，其餘諸地而不斷者，先已斷故。	依未至禪斷欲界欲，其餘諸地而不斷者，先已斷故。	Because the desire realm is eliminated based on the preliminary concentration, but the other stages do not eliminate it, because it has already been eliminated.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a07_10']	猶如日光於一切時與闇相妨，日初出時已破夜闇，其餘日分雖與闇相違而不破者，先已破故。	猶如日光於一切時與闇相妨，日初出時已破夜闇，其餘日分雖與闇相違而不破者，先已破故。	Just as sunlight interferes with darkness at all times, when the sun first rises it breaks through the night's darkness, and although the remaining parts of the day oppose darkness, it does not break through what has already been broken.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a08_4']	亦如六人同一怨家而共議言：	亦如六人同一怨家而共議言：	It is also like six people who have a common enemy and discuss together:
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a08_13']	隨於何處獲便害之。	隨於何處獲便害之。	Wherever we find an opportunity, we will kill him.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a10_12']	猶如有人次持六燈入於闇室，初燈破闇，其餘諸燈雖與闇相違而不破者，先已破故。	猶如有人次持六燈入於闇室，初燈破闇，其餘諸燈雖與闇相違而不破者，先已破故。	It is also like a person who takes six lamps in turn into a dark room. The first lamp breaks through the darkness, and although the remaining lamps oppose the darkness, they do not break through what has already been broken.

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a19_6']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a21_13']	世第一法雖不能斷結，而此善根妙勝第一在深遠處，宜應與彼地離欲界道同在一處，是故以道證之。	世第一法雖不能斷結，而此善根妙勝第一在深遠處，宜應與彼地離欲界道同在一處，是故以道證之。	Although the supreme worldly dharmas cannot abandon the bonds, this wholesome root is supreme, excellent, and in a profound and distant place. It should be in the same place as the path that is free from the desire of that stage. Therefore, it is realized by the path.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a21_16']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:

['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a23_11']	彼善根微小、法身未長，雖爾有大威勢。	彼善根微小、法身未長，雖爾有大威勢。	Those wholesome roots are small and the Dharma body is not yet fully developed, although they have great power.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a24_7']	以善根微小、法身未長，不能斷結。	以善根微小、法身未長，不能斷結。	Because the wholesome roots are small and the Dharma body is not yet fully developed, they cannot eliminate the bonds.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a25_2']	有大威勢故，不為諸結之所毀壞。	有大威勢故，不為諸結之所毀壞。	Because they have great power, they are not destroyed by the bonds.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a26_11']	如師子子身小未長，不能害狩，有大威勢，一切諸狩不能侵害。	如師子子身小未長，不能害狩，有大威勢，一切諸狩不能侵害。	Just as a lion cub, although its body is small and not yet fully grown, cannot harm other animals, it has great power, and no other animals can harm it.
['ZH_T28_1546_002:0010a27_12']	或有說者，世第一法是一剎那，故不能斷結。	或有說者，世第一法是一剎那，故不能斷結。	Some say: The supreme worldly dharmas are only one moment, therefore they cannot eliminate the bonds.
