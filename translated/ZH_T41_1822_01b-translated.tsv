['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b16_16']	一不可攝在色等蘊中。	一不可攝在色等蘊中。	01b	First, it cannot be included in the form and other aggregates.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b17_2']	非色等故。	非色等故。	01b	Because it is not form and so forth.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b17_12']	二不可別立為第六蘊。	二不可別立為第六蘊。	01b	Second, it cannot be separately established as a sixth aggregate.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b18_5']	無蘊義故　此文初也。	無蘊義故　此文初也。	01b	Because it lacks the meaning of an aggregate. This is the first part of the text.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b18_7']	論。	論。	01b	The treatise says:
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b18_17']	亦不可說至名無為蘊。	亦不可說至名無為蘊。	01b	It also cannot be said to be an unconditioned aggregate.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b19_5']	第二無蘊義也。	第二無蘊義也。	01b	The second part is the lack of the meaning of an aggregate.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b19_10']	文中有三。	文中有三。	01b	There are three parts to the text.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b19_15']	一無聚義。	一無聚義。	01b	First, the lack of the meaning of a collection.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b20_1']	二無依義。	二無依義。	01b	Second, the lack of a basis.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b20_15']	三蘊義息　此是第一無聚義也。	三蘊義息　此是第一無聚義也。	01b	Third, the cessation of the meaning of an aggregate. This is the first part, the lack of the meaning of a collection.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b20_17']	論。	論。	01b	The treatise says:
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b21_9']	又言取蘊至故不立蘊。	又言取蘊至故不立蘊。	01b	Moreover, it is said that the appropriated aggregates... Therefore, they are not established as aggregates.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b21_16']	第二無依義也。	第二無依義也。	01b	The second part is the lack of a basis.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b22_1']	論。	論。	01b	The treatise says:
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b22_8']	有說至應非蘊。	有說至應非蘊。	01b	Some say... should not be aggregates.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b22_12']	第三釋。	第三釋。	01b	The third explanation.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b23_1']	蘊義息故非蘊也。	蘊義息故非蘊也。	01b	Because the meaning of aggregates ceases, they are not aggregates.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b23_3']	論。	論。	01b	The treatise says:
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b23_12']	彼於處界例應成失。	彼於處界例應成失。	01b	They should incur the same fault in the case of sense bases and elements.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b24_2']	論主破第三釋。	論主破第三釋。	01b	The author of the treatise refutes the third interpretation.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b24_9']	若蘊息得無為。	若蘊息得無為。	01b	If the cessation of aggregates attains the unconditioned,
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b24_15']	無為非蘊攝。	無為非蘊攝。	01b	The unconditioned is not included in the aggregates.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b25_4']	處．界息故得無為。	處．界息故得無為。	01b	Because the cessation of sense bases and elements attains the unconditioned,
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b25_11', 'ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b26_9']	無為非處．界。🔽故言彼於處．界例應成失　正理救云。	無為非處．界。 故言彼於處．界例應成失　正理救云。	01b	The unconditioned is not a sense base or element.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b26_14']	經主難言。	經主難言。	01b	Therefore it says they should incur the same fault in the case of sense bases and elements. The correct principle is that the master of the sūtra raises an objection, saying:
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b27_5']	彼於處．界例應成失。	彼於處．界例應成失。	01b	They should incur the same fault in the case of sense bases and elements.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b27_11']	謂處．界息。	謂處．界息。	01b	That is, if sense bases and elements cease,🔽They should not be sense bases and elements.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b28_12']	應非處．界　便違所宗　全於蘊門眾生計我。	應非處．界　便違所宗　全於蘊門眾生計我。	01b	This contradicts their own doctrine. Completely in the realm of the aggregates, beings conceive of a self.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b29_10']	入無餘位諸蘊頓息　處．界不然。	入無餘位諸蘊頓息　處．界不然。	01b	When entering the state of no remainder, all the aggregates suddenly cease. Sense bases and elements are not like this.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490b29_15']	非全生故。	非全生故。	01b	Because they do not arise completely.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c01_14']	唯取蘊起假說為生　若諸蘊息亦立為蘊。	唯取蘊起假說為生　若諸蘊息亦立為蘊。	01b	Only taking the arising of the aggregates, it is provisionally said to be arising. If the cessation of the aggregates is also established as an aggregate,
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c02_5']	般涅槃已餘蘊應存。	般涅槃已餘蘊應存。	01b	After parinirvāṇa, the remaining aggregates should exist.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c02_14']	眾生畏蘊有多過患。	眾生畏蘊有多過患。	01b	Beings fear the aggregates because of their many faults.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c03_5']	應於涅槃無安穩想。	應於涅槃無安穩想。	01b	They should have no thought of peace and security regarding nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c03_15']	非處．界中全有多過。	非處．界中全有多過。	01b	In the case of the realms and bases, there are many errors in their entirety.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c04_6']	故無餘位處．界猶隨。	故無餘位處．界猶隨。	01b	Therefore, in the remaining states, the realms and bases still follow.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c05_2']	故蘊不應例彼成失　又此息言。	故蘊不應例彼成失　又此息言。	01b	Therefore, the aggregates should not be taken as an example to prove a fault. The word cessation
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c05_7']	意非顯斷。	意非顯斷。	01b	Does not mean cutting off.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c05_17', 'ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c06_6']	空．非擇滅體非斷故。🔽此言意顯若於是處。	空．非擇滅體非斷故。 此言意顯若於是處。	01b	Because the nature of space and non-analytical cessation is not cutting off.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c06_15']	蘊相都無名為蘊息。	蘊相都無名為蘊息。	01b	This word intends to show that if the characteristics of the aggregates are completely non-existent in a certain place, it is called the cessation of the aggregates.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c07_1', 'ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c07_10']	三無為上。🔽聚義都無可名蘊息。	三無為上。 聚義都無可名蘊息。	01b	Above the three unconditioned dharmas,🔽The meaning of aggregation is completely non-existent, which can be called the cessation of the aggregates.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c07_17']	非生門．族義。	非生門．族義。	01b	The meaning of birth gate and clan
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c08_3']	於彼亦無。	於彼亦無。	01b	Does not exist there either.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c09_8']	故不應例　此釋與頌義善相符有人作俱舍釋破云。	故不應例　此釋與頌義善相符有人作俱舍釋破云。	01b	Therefore, it should not be taken as an example. Someone who composed a commentary on the Abhidharmakośa refutes it, saying:
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c10_1']	若言無為無聚義者。	若言無為無聚義者。	01b	If it is said that the unconditioned dharmas have no meaning of aggregation,
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c11_11']	與我此論初解何殊　然檢三解竝是婆沙師釋也　檢正理抄云。	與我此論初解何殊　然檢三解竝是婆沙師釋也　檢正理抄云。	01b	How is this different from my first explanation in this treatise? However, examining the three explanations, they are all explanations by the masters of the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya. Examining the notes on the Nyāyapraveśa, it says:
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c11_14']	經主。	經主。	01b	The author of the commentary.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c12_2']	謬取古師意。	謬取古師意。	01b	Mistakenly takes the ancient master's meaning.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c12_14']	謂息為斷　若以斷義名息。	謂息為斷　若以斷義名息。	01b	Saying that cessation means cutting off. If the meaning of cutting off is called cessation,
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c13_6']	即有空．非擇滅難。	即有空．非擇滅難。	01b	Then there is the difficulty of space and non-analytical cessation.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c13_11']	彼非斷故。	彼非斷故。	01b	Because they are not eliminated.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c13_17']	亦名蘊息故。	亦名蘊息故。	01b	They are also called aggregates that cease.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c14_6']	若以無聚義故名息。	若以無聚義故名息。	01b	If the meaning of cessation is taken to be the meaning of non-accumulation,
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c14_16']	即不合舉處．界為例。	即不合舉處．界為例。	01b	then it is not appropriate to cite the bases and elements as examples.🔽This is because the meanings of the bases and elements do not cease.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c15_12']	處．界義不息故　今詳不爾。	處．界義不息故　今詳不爾。	01b	Now, this is not so.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c16_5']	若唯斷義名息唯在擇滅。	若唯斷義名息唯在擇滅。	01b	If the meaning of cessation is taken to be the meaning of elimination, then it only exists in cessation through discernment.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c16_11']	唯取蘊有息。	唯取蘊有息。	01b	Only the aggregates have cessation.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c17_2']	餘蘊無息無擇滅故。	餘蘊無息無擇滅故。	01b	The other aggregates do not have cessation because they do not have cessation through discernment.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c17_14', 'ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c19_1']	亦不是都無蘊相名之為息。🔽由第三解與第一釋不合同故　今詳古師言息。	亦不是都無蘊相名之為息。 由第三解與第一釋不合同故　今詳古師言息。	01b	It is also not the case that the absence of the characteristics of the aggregates is called cessation.🔽This is because the third interpretation is not the same as the first explanation.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c19_10']	息滅所顯故名為息。	息滅所顯故名為息。	01b	Now, this is analyzed. The ancient masters said that cessation is called cessation because it is manifested by the cessation of cessation.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c20_2']	一切有漏法有二種息。	一切有漏法有二種息。	01b	All contaminated dharmas have two kinds of cessation.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c20_9']	謂斷及非擇滅。	謂斷及非擇滅。	01b	They are cessation through discernment and cessation not resulting from consideration.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c20_16']	色滅兼顯虛空。	色滅兼顯虛空。	01b	The cessation of form also manifests space.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c21_8']	有為無漏唯有非擇滅息。	有為無漏唯有非擇滅息。	01b	Conditioned, uncontaminated dharmas only have the cessation not resulting from consideration.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c21_13']	若以蘊息。	若以蘊息。	01b	If the cessation of the aggregates
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c22_5']	故顯無為則蘊不攝者。	故顯無為則蘊不攝者。	01b	is taken to manifest the unconditioned, then the aggregates do not include it.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c22_16']	十七界全．一界少分息。	十七界全．一界少分息。	01b	Seventeen of the eighteen elements are completely ceased, and a small part of one element is ceased.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c23_2']	顯三無為。	顯三無為。	01b	This manifests the three unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c23_10']	亦應無為非界攝。	亦應無為非界攝。	01b	It should also be that the unconditioned is not included in the realms.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c23_15']	彼非斷故。	彼非斷故。	01b	Also, the unconditioned should not be included in the aggregates, because they are not destroyed.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c24_3']	亦名蘊息故。	亦名蘊息故。	01b	Because they are also called the cessation of the aggregates.

['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c25_5']	即不合舉處．界為例。	即不合舉處．界為例。	01b	then it is not appropriate to cite the sense bases and elements as examples.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c25_13']	處．界義不息故。	處．界義不息故。	01b	Because the meanings of the sense bases and elements are not ceased.
['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c26_3']	應以空．非擇滅為難。	應以空．非擇滅為難。	01b	One should raise the difficulty of space and cessation not due to contemplation.

['ZH_T41_1822_01b:0490c27_11']	論主此破即違初解。	論主此破即違初解。	01b	then the refutation by the author of the treatise contradicts the first explanation.
