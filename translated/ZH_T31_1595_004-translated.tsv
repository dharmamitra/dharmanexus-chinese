Therefore, the retributive consciousness must be established as not leaving the body during concentration.

['ZH_T31_1595_004:0175b12_6']	若人謂第三第四果緣覺菩薩等，為得寂靜住及離退失過故，聖人修滅心定。	若人謂第三第四果緣覺菩薩等，為得寂靜住及離退失過故，聖人修滅心定。	If a person says that the third and fourth fruits, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, etc., in order to attain tranquil abiding and avoid the fault of regression, the sages cultivate the concentration of cessation of ideation.
['ZH_T31_1595_004:0175b13_14']	非滅心體稱滅心，滅心法故名滅心，以能依從所依故立心名。	非滅心體稱滅心，滅心法故名滅心，以能依從所依故立心名。	It is not that the essence of the cessation of ideation is called the cessation of ideation, but because it causes the cessation of the dharma of ideation, it is called the cessation of ideation, because the dependent is established based on the support.

['ZH_T31_1595_004:0175b18_12']	言過失者，六識緣外塵，有起不正思惟義。	言過失者，六識緣外塵，有起不正思惟義。	As for the faults, the six consciousnesses take external objects as conditions, and there is the meaning of giving rise to incorrect thought.

It is said that this consciousness is not separated from the body.

['ZH_T31_1595_004:0175c02_10']	心非永滅後時更生，故說識不離身。	心非永滅後時更生，故說識不離身。	Because the mind is not eternally extinguished and later arises again, it is said that consciousness is not separated from the body.

If a person enters the second concentration, etc., the verbal activities are then severed. If a person enters the concentration of cessation, the mental activities are then severed.

The mind should also be like this. It is only that the mental activities cease, but the mind does not perish. Therefore, it is said that consciousness is not separated from the body.

Mind and mental activities have never been seen to be separated from each other, as other mental activities are from other minds. Feeling is never separated from conceptualization, and conceptualization is never separated from feeling.
['ZH_T31_1595_004:0175c29_5']	心與心法亦爾，無時得相離。	心與心法亦爾，無時得相離。	It is the same with mind and mental activities. There is never a time when they are separated from each other.

['ZH_T31_1595_004:0176a05_4']	修滅心定者求得寂靜住，為對治能障寂靜住心及心法故。	修滅心定者求得寂靜住，為對治能障寂靜住心及心法故。	One who cultivates the samādhi of the cessation of mind seeks to attain a tranquil abiding, and in order to counteract the mind and mental activities that obstruct tranquil abiding.
['ZH_T31_1595_004:0176a06_13']	滅心定生，不為對治不明了本識修滅心定故，餘識滅此識不滅。	滅心定生，不為對治不明了本識修滅心定故，餘識滅此識不滅。	The samādhi of the cessation of mind is born, but it is not cultivated in order to counteract the fundamental consciousness, which is not clear and distinct. Therefore, the other consciousnesses are extinguished, but this consciousness is not extinguished.
