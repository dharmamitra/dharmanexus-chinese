['ZH_T35_1735_011:0573c07_11']	世界無邊悉嚴淨故；	世界無邊悉嚴淨故；	because the worlds are boundless and they all adorn and purify them;
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0573c08_2']	眾生無邊悉化度故；	眾生無邊悉化度故；	because sentient beings are boundless and they all transform and liberate them;
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0573c08_16']	剎由心異，當淨自心及他心故；	剎由心異，當淨自心及他心故；	The realm is due to the difference in mind, in order to purify one's own mind and the minds of others;

['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a01_6']	上入三昧，內契其源；	上入三昧，內契其源；	Above, entering samādhi, internally conforming with the source;
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a01_16']	今云遍觀，外審其相。	今云遍觀，外審其相。	Now, saying observing everywhere, externally examining the characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a02_11']	十海之義已如問釋，但小不次耳。	十海之義已如問釋，但小不次耳。	The meaning of the ten oceans has already been explained in the questions, but it is slightly out of order.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a04_2']	但觀於十，已含餘三十，佛海之中具身等故，大願之中含因等故。	但觀於十，已含餘三十，佛海之中具身等故，大願之中含因等故。	But observing the ten already includes the remaining thirty, because the ocean of buddhas is replete with the body and so forth, and because the great vows include causes and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a04_18']	第二「如是觀察已」下，牒問許說。	第二「如是觀察已」下，牒問許說。	Second, below having observed in this way, summarizing the questions and allowing explanation.

['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a12_2']	觀乃觀海、歎乃歎智者，智之與海反覆相成，謂前自智觀海微細難知，知唯佛智方能究盡，海難思故佛智難思，佛智難思故海為深廣。	觀乃觀海、歎乃歎智者，智之與海反覆相成，謂前自智觀海微細難知，知唯佛智方能究盡，海難思故佛智難思，佛智難思故海為深廣。	Contemplation refers to contemplating the ocean, and praise refers to praising the wisdom of the Buddha. Wisdom and the ocean mutually reinforce each other, meaning that one's own wisdom contemplates the ocean, which is subtle and difficult to know. Only the wisdom of the Buddha can thoroughly understand it. Because the ocean is difficult to fathom, the wisdom of the Buddha is also difficult to fathom. Because the wisdom of the Buddha is difficult to fathom, the ocean is profound and vast.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a12_14']	若爾，何不說智而但說海？	若爾，何不說智而但說海？	If that is so, why not speak of wisdom but only speak of the ocean?
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a13_4']	智離海境，安知其相？	智離海境，安知其相？	How can one know its characteristics if wisdom is apart from the realm of the ocean?

['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a14_13']	十智望海與問開合小異，名或小差。	十智望海與問開合小異，名或小差。	The ten wisdoms compared to the ocean have slight differences in the opening and closing of the questions, and the names may differ slightly.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a16_14']	謂一中前問及觀但云世界海，今加成壞，望前與智中亦有成壞之言，此乃廣略之異耳。	謂一中前問及觀但云世界海，今加成壞，望前與智中亦有成壞之言，此乃廣略之異耳。	For example, in the first question and contemplation above, it only says ocean of worlds, but now it adds formation and destruction. Compared to the wisdom above, there are also words about formation and destruction. This is only a difference in breadth.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a17_13']	言清淨智者，離所知障，決斷分明故。	言清淨智者，離所知障，決斷分明故。	As for pure wisdom, it is free from the obstacle to that which is to be known and decisively clear.

['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a21_15']	二知眾生業海者，眾生即報類差別，業即善惡等殊，從此別義，觀中開為二句。	二知眾生業海者，眾生即報類差別，業即善惡等殊，從此別義，觀中開為二句。	Second, knowing the ocean of sentient beings' karma: Sentient beings refer to the distinctions in the classes of karmic retribution, while karma refers to the differences in good and evil, etc. From this specific meaning, it is divided into two phrases in the contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a23_4']	而因果雖殊，同是所化眾生，故此及問并與智中並合為一。	而因果雖殊，同是所化眾生，故此及問并與智中並合為一。	Although cause and effect are different, they are both sentient beings to be transformed, so this and the question are combined into one in the wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a24_10']	三即世界都稱，或化眾生法，謂安立施設方便軌則等也。	三即世界都稱，或化眾生法，謂安立施設方便軌則等也。	Third, it is the general term for the world, or the Dharma for transforming sentient beings, referring to the established methods and rules, etc.

['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a26_13']	五即所化根欲差別難知，而問中合在後之五海，五海皆須知根欲故。	五即所化根欲差別難知，而問中合在後之五海，五海皆須知根欲故。	Fifth, it is difficult to know the distinctions in the faculties and desires of those to be transformed, but in the question it is combined with the following five oceans, because the five oceans all require knowledge of faculties and desires.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a28_9']	六即所應之時，前就所觀但云三世，今就佛智故云一念能知其問及與智。	六即所應之時，前就所觀但云三世，今就佛智故云一念能知其問及與智。	Sixth, it is the time to respond. Previously, in terms of what is observed, it only said the three times, but now, in terms of the Buddha's wisdom, it says in a single thought one can know its question and wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574a29_16']	皆云佛解脫海者，以一念普知三世，是佛不思議解脫故。	皆云佛解脫海者，以一念普知三世，是佛不思議解脫故。	All say ocean of Buddha's liberation because knowing the three times in a single thought is the inconceivable liberation of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574b01_15']	七稱性大願為現身說法，遍化之因故。	七稱性大願為現身說法，遍化之因故。	Seventh, the great vows in accordance with the nature serve as the cause for manifesting the body and expounding the Dharma to universally transform.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574b03_12']	前問是名號海及壽量海，與智之中名普入法界一切世界海智，皆由願力故也。	前問是名號海及壽量海，與智之中名普入法界一切世界海智，皆由願力故也。	The previous question is about the ocean of names and the ocean of lifespans, and within the wisdom, the wisdom that universally enters the ocean of all worlds, all due to the power of vows.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574b04_3']	八應機作用神變無方。	八應機作用神變無方。	Eighth, responding to capacities with spiritual transformations that are boundless.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574b04_12']	九轉稱性大法輪海。	九轉稱性大法輪海。	Ninth, turning the great Dharma wheel in accordance with the nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574b05_7']	若據問中，攝法輪海在演說中；	若據問中，攝法輪海在演說中；	If based on the question, the ocean of Dharma wheels is included within the explanation;

['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574b10_3']	向十約智明不思議，此下直就法體為不思議。	向十約智明不思議，此下直就法體為不思議。	The previous ten were about using wisdom to illuminate the inconceivable, while this section directly discusses the Dharma essence as inconceivable.
['ZH_T35_1735_011:0574b10_17']	又望前問開合影略，顯無盡故；	又望前問開合影略，顯無盡故；	Moreover, compared to the previous question, it reveals the inexhaustible by opening up the brief in the extensive;
