Initially attaining the truth, delusion and enlightenment are just beginning to be distinguished, like being long deluded and just beginning to be correct, thus it is said to be startled and awakened. Again, one is frightened and the deluded path is about to end.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b05_4']	次約三世者，不云過去及以集者，現觀未苦由於現集，又觀現苦由過去集，如因緣中名為輪迴，雖論三世正觀現苦，以斷現集，今當苦息，故知不覺現苦即苦集俱迷，由此能招未來世苦，既迷苦集理無道滅，舉二世苦以攝三世，具如引文，亦秖以苦而攝於集。	次約三世者，不云過去及以集者，現觀未苦由於現集，又觀現苦由過去集，如因緣中名為輪迴，雖論三世正觀現苦，以斷現集，今當苦息，故知不覺現苦即苦集俱迷，由此能招未來世苦，既迷苦集理無道滅，舉二世苦以攝三世，具如引文，亦秖以苦而攝於集。	06b	Next, in terms of the three periods of time, it does not say past and accumulation. The present contemplation of suffering is due to the present accumulation. Moreover, the contemplation of present suffering is due to past accumulation. In the causal links, it is called revolving. Although it discusses the three periods of time, it correctly contemplates present suffering, in order to eliminate present accumulation, and to stop future suffering. Therefore, it is known that not being aware of present suffering is the delusion of both suffering and accumulation. Due to this, it can attract suffering in future lives. Since there is delusion regarding suffering and accumulation, there is no path or cessation. The suffering of the two periods of time includes the three periods of time. It is just like the quoted text, which only uses suffering to include accumulation.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b07_1']	然前三釋，雖復約凡約位等三，總而言之，並是迷諦，以迷諦故八苦逼身。	然前三釋，雖復約凡約位等三，總而言之，並是迷諦，以迷諦故八苦逼身。	06b	However, although the previous three explanations are in terms of ordinary beings, stages, etc., in general, they are all delusions regarding the truths. Due to the delusion of the truths, the eight sufferings oppress the body.

['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b10_5']	同時意識俱受苦境，非初剎那未分別時，又秖此五識體是異熟八苦故也。	同時意識俱受苦境，非初剎那未分別時，又秖此五識體是異熟八苦故也。	06b	The simultaneous mental consciousness experiences the suffering object, not in the first moment before discrimination. Moreover, these five consciousnesses themselves are the eight kinds of suffering that are karmic results.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b10_19']	近豈過此，故此同時安能厭患？	近豈過此，故此同時安能厭患？	06b	How could there be anything closer than this? Therefore, how could this simultaneous [mental consciousness] be able to give rise to disgust?
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b13_1']	故此心王心所不能以此意識成觀，唯能分別以成三受，三受義成故云切己，逼甚故切。	故此心王心所不能以此意識成觀，唯能分別以成三受，三受義成故云切己，逼甚故切。	06b	Therefore, this mental consciousness and mental factors are unable to use this mental consciousness to form contemplation. They are only able to discriminate and form the three feelings. Because the meaning of the three feelings is established, it is said to be deeply felt. It is very oppressive, so it is deeply felt.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b14_14']	故一一苦皆由五識以對於境，次至第六而重分別，復立苦因何能生厭？	故一一苦皆由五識以對於境，次至第六而重分別，復立苦因何能生厭？	06b	Therefore, each suffering is due to the five consciousnesses corresponding to the object, and then reaching the sixth [mental consciousness] to be repeatedly discriminated. How can it give rise to disgust?
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b17_16']	「亦云」去出他釋，昔結大乘名之為種，功德即是法身家之智慧，即以此智為體，為苦所逼，大理智乘俱遭苦集，不覺不知名為火逼。	「亦云」去出他釋，昔結大乘名之為種，功德即是法身家之智慧，即以此智為體，為苦所逼，大理智乘俱遭苦集，不覺不知名為火逼。	06b	It is also said presents another interpretation. In the past, the name of the Mahayana was called seeds. Merit is the wisdom of the family of the Dharma body. This wisdom is used as the essence. It is oppressed by suffering. The vehicle of the great wisdom principle suffers both the truth of suffering and the truth of the origin of suffering. Not being aware or knowing is called being oppressed by fire.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b19_11']	「今謂」下但約濁名不須對大，既流轉已小尚不知，故總諸義共成五濁。	「今謂」下但約濁名不須對大，既流轉已小尚不知，故總諸義共成五濁。	06b	Now I say below, it is only about the name of turbidity and does not need to correspond to the great. Since it has already flowed and turned, the small still does not know, so it collectively forms the five turbidities.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b21_3']	「不覺」等四為眾生濁者，四句秖是迷於四諦，以迷諦故眾生即濁。	「不覺」等四為眾生濁者，四句秖是迷於四諦，以迷諦故眾生即濁。	06b	Not realizing and the other four are the turbidity of sentient beings. The four phrases are just being confused about the four truths. Because of being confused about the truths, sentient beings are then turbid.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b22_3']	次「火來」等為命濁者，苦盛壽促令命成濁。	次「火來」等為命濁者，苦盛壽促令命成濁。	06b	Next, the fire coming and so forth are the turbidity of life. Suffering is abundant and life is short, causing life to become turbid.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b23_12']	「心不厭」等為劫濁者，由不厭苦常在三界，必遇三小名為劫濁。	「心不厭」等為劫濁者，由不厭苦常在三界，必遇三小名為劫濁。	06b	The mind not being disgusted and so forth are the turbidity of the eon. Because of not being disgusted with suffering and always being in the three realms, one will certainly encounter the three small [vehicles], which is called the turbidity of the eon.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b24_11']	「云云」者，意斥舊師，不須將此對大說也。	「云云」者，意斥舊師，不須將此對大說也。	06b	And so on means the intention is to rebuke the old masters, and it is not necessary to take this to correspond to the great [vehicle] and explain it.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b25_18']	以五濁故，正當廣上所見之火，故上但云「從四面起」。	以五濁故，正當廣上所見之火，故上但云「從四面起」。	06b	Because of the five turbidities, it is just like the fire seen in the above passage, so above it only says arises from the four sides.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262b27_9']	「長者作是」下，先釋能施身手，次釋所施衣裓，能所俱廢故云「不得」。	「長者作是」下，先釋能施身手，次釋所施衣裓，能所俱廢故云「不得」。	06b	The elder thinking like this and below, first explaining the body and hands that can give, next explaining the robe and basket that are given. Because both the able and the given are abandoned, it says cannot be obtained.

Encouragement is the gate of wisdom, and admonition is the gate of elimination. Therefore, it is said that one enters through the two gates.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262c06_12']	今於勸門中復言誡者，門體理合互具故也，各一義便故且別說。	今於勸門中復言誡者，門體理合互具故也，各一義便故且別說。	06b	Now, in the gate of encouragement, it is said again that admonition is because the essence of the gate should mutually possess it. Each meaning is convenient, so it is explained separately.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262c09_11']	六四悉中云「此二悉檀為第一義作方便」者，二悉是修得智斷，第一義即是性德法身，〈方便品〉初以法身智斷取物不得，是故息化。	六四悉中云「此二悉檀為第一義作方便」者，二悉是修得智斷，第一義即是性德法身，〈方便品〉初以法身智斷取物不得，是故息化。	06b	The Six and Four Universals all say, These two Universals are expedient means for the ultimate truth. The two Universals are the wisdom and elimination attained through cultivation, while the ultimate truth is the inherent virtue of the Dharma body. At the beginning of the chapter on skillful means, the Dharma body and wisdom cannot be used to take hold of beings, and therefore the teaching is suspended.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0262c10_12']	問何不云世界悉檀各二門不同，隨樂各別。	問何不云世界悉檀各二門不同，隨樂各別。	06b	Why not say that the Universal of the World has two different gates, and that each is different according to one's preferences?

However, then the Dharma should all be without burning. It should originally be the same as things, and from things it is said to burn. From principle, then the Dharma should be indestructible.

As previously stated, bodhisattvas have not yet reached the stage of permission, because they do not sever afflictions, they do not reach the same stage of permitted fruition as the two vehicles, so they do not request. Therefore, it is only in the Tripiṭaka that it is explained that bodhisattvas do not sever afflictions, so it is judged as up to.

The people of the three vehicles who attain the principle are the same. They are all reprimanded as being expedient. If they want to seek the true principle again, they must all request it.

When one becomes a Buddha, there is no meaning of requesting the vehicle, but it is simply judged to belong to the Tripiṭaka [Teaching].
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265b19_12']	故菩提樹下三十二心猶名菩薩，時節既促索義不成，此則可爾；	故菩提樹下三十二心猶名菩薩，時節既促索義不成，此則可爾；	06b	Therefore, under the bodhi tree, the thirty-two thoughts are still called the bodhisattva stage. Since the time is short, the meaning of requesting [the Buddha's teachings] is not established. This can be so.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265b20_3']	言思未盡此不應然。	言思未盡此不應然。	06b	But to say that the thinking has not yet been exhausted, this is not appropriate.

How much more so for the thirty-three thoughts!
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265b25_5']	言佛不索道理如然，彼亦不知因不至果，至三十三心必無實行，可中此佛實是三祇至果但斷見修而已還同羅漢，如云世間有六羅漢，羅漢安得不索車耶？	言佛不索道理如然，彼亦不知因不至果，至三十三心必無實行，可中此佛實是三祇至果但斷見修而已還同羅漢，如云世間有六羅漢，羅漢安得不索車耶？	06b	As for saying the Buddha did not seek the truth, they also do not know that causes do not reach their fruits, and that after thirty-three minds there is definitely no real practice. In the middle, this Buddha is truly one who reaches the fruit after three asaṃkhyeya kalpas, but only cuts off views and cultivation, and is the same as an arhat. As it is said, there are six arhats in the world. How could the arhats not seek the vehicle?
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265b26_8']	秖由彼不知權，故且難之，其教既權進退有妨。	秖由彼不知權，故且難之，其教既權進退有妨。	06b	It is precisely because they do not know the expedient that they are temporarily refuted. Their teaching being expedient, there is obstruction in advancing and retreating.

This takes the third passage as an example. The previous third passage, if the bodhisattvas advance to cut off habitual propensities and ignorance, the principle becomes combining to form the Buddha, and the meaning of seeking is not established.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265c01_15']	「此三乘」下正判屬通，教既未實菩薩須索，次以具縛況之。	「此三乘」下正判屬通，教既未實菩薩須索，次以具縛況之。	06b	This three vehicles and below correctly determines it belongs to the common teaching. Since the teaching is not yet real, the bodhisattvas must seek. Next, it uses being bound by all afflictions as an analogy.

One should know that the word only one is inclusive of both, not exclusive. They take the only one outside of the two that are relied upon, not knowing that the bodhisattvas of the four teachings are all called only one. Therefore, the three only ones still need to seek the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265c08_10']	當知前三是待二唯一，圓教唯一方是絕待，如三藏唯一之外猶有三教，通別可知。	當知前三是待二唯一，圓教唯一方是絕待，如三藏唯一之外猶有三教，通別可知。	06b	One should know that the previous three are the only one that relies on the two, and the only one of the perfect teaching is the one that transcends reliance. It is like outside of the only one of the Tripiṭaka, there are still the three teachings. The Shared and Distinct can be known.

The text of the shared and unshared comes from the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra. The unshared bodhisattvas may not need to seek, because they have the perfect.
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265c12_11']	又不共兼別，別尚須索況共菩薩？	又不共兼別，別尚須索況共菩薩？	06b	Moreover, the unshared is also shared with the Distinct. The Distinct still needs to seek, let alone the shared bodhisattvas?
['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265c13_15']	故汝不知所付之財兼共不共，而一向云真實不索。	故汝不知所付之財兼共不共，而一向云真實不索。	06b	Therefore, you do not know that the wealth entrusted to you includes both the common and the uncommon, yet you unilaterally say that in reality it is not sought.

['ZH_T34_1719_06b:0265c17_2']	況汝自云至法華來皆是真實，以汝不知三味異故。	況汝自云至法華來皆是真實，以汝不知三味異故。	06b	Moreover, you yourself say that up to the Lotus Sūtra it is all real, because you do not know that the three flavors are different.

Since the passage from the chapter on the origin states that both the great and small vehicles, oneself and others, are all expedient, compared to the original text, even the perfect [teaching] is still expedient, let alone the biased [teachings]?

Since it is said that each phrase is divided into four, it is simply a listing of the four phrases in the text on the various teachings. This means that each of the four teachings uses the removal, etc. to compare to the activation as a phrase to clarify the seeking of the vehicle. The main point is in the activation, so in each of the teachings, the removal, etc. is used to compare to the activation as a statement. Therefore, the text only lists the four phrases as a model, and still uses these phrases to distinguish the five flavors, so that it is known that the capacities in the four flavors are not yet pure, so there are differences between the subsequent teachings in each teaching.
