['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c06_18']	此下三品，第二、廣明持經功德獎勸流通。	此下三品，第二、廣明持經功德獎勸流通。	011	Below this, the next three chapters are the second part, which extensively clarifies the merits of upholding the sūtra and encourages its circulation.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c07_5']	三品即為三章：	三品即為三章：	011	The three chapters are divided into three sections:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c07_20']	初、〈隨喜品〉明弟子下品功德；	初、〈隨喜品〉明弟子下品功德；	011	First, the Chapter on Rejoicing in the Merits clarifies the merits of the disciples of the lower grade;
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c08_19']	第二、〈法師品〉明五種法師，即是中品功德；	第二、〈法師品〉明五種法師，即是中品功德；	011	Second, the Chapter on Dharma Teachers clarifies the five types of Dharma teachers, which are the merits of the middle grade;
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c10_4']	第三、〈常不輕品〉明持《法華》得六根清淨乃至成佛，謂上品功德。	第三、〈常不輕品〉明持《法華》得六根清淨乃至成佛，謂上品功德。	011	Third, the Chapter on Constant Respectfulness clarifies the merits of upholding the Lotus Sūtra and attaining the purity of the six sense faculties, up to becoming a Buddha, which are the merits of the upper grade.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c11_2']	約位分者，初、隨喜人從發心至十信位。	約位分者，初、隨喜人從發心至十信位。	011	In terms of stages, first, those who rejoice in the merits are from the stage of arousing the mind to the stage of the ten faiths.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c11_15']	第二、六根清淨，三十心位。	第二、六根清淨，三十心位。	011	Second, the purity of the six sense faculties is the stage of the thirty minds.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c13_22']	故《法華論》云「得六根清淨者，凡夫人以經力故得根勝用、未入初地」，而經文云「未得無漏」，故知是地前人。	故《法華論》云「得六根清淨者，凡夫人以經力故得根勝用、未入初地」，而經文云「未得無漏」，故知是地前人。	011	Therefore, the Fahua lun says, Those who attain the purity of the six sense faculties are ordinary people who, due to the power of the sutra, attain the superior functions of the faculties but have not yet entered the first ground. And the sutra text says, Not yet attaining the undefiled, so we know they are people before the grounds.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c15_1']	第三、〈常不輕品〉寄迹而言從內凡以上乃至得佛。	第三、〈常不輕品〉寄迹而言從內凡以上乃至得佛。	011	Third, the Chapter on Constant Respectfulness uses traces to speak from the inner ordinary person upwards to attaining Buddhahood.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c16_21']	此之三品則攝大乘五十二位，五十二位賢聖皆從《法華經》生，故嘆經勝用勸物宣持也。	此之三品則攝大乘五十二位，五十二位賢聖皆從《法華經》生，故嘆經勝用勸物宣持也。	011	These three chapters then encompass the fifty-two stages of the Great Vehicle. The sages of the fifty-two stages are all born from the Lotus Sutra, so it praises the supreme function of the sutra and encourages people to proclaim and uphold it.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c19_2']	所以有此品來者，一者、遠從前〈法師品〉明二世弟子聞經隨喜，上雖言即與授記，未廣說其功德；	所以有此品來者，一者、遠從前〈法師品〉明二世弟子聞經隨喜，上雖言即與授記，未廣說其功德；	011	The reason for this chapter is as follows: First, from afar it follows the Chapter on Dharma Teachers in explaining how disciples of the two periods who hear the sutra and rejoice in it were given predictions above, although it has not yet extensively explained their merits;
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c19_14']	今欲說之，故有此品來也。	今欲說之，故有此品來也。	011	Now, wanting to explain them, this chapter comes.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c21_2']	二者、若依品次相生，聞上分別功德欣然相傳，故有〈隨喜品〉。	二者、若依品次相生，聞上分別功德欣然相傳，故有〈隨喜品〉。	011	Second, if based on the sequence of chapters, after hearing the merits of the superior chapter on distinctions, they joyfully transmit it, thus there is the Chapter on Rejoicing.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c22_16']	三者、上品末說「如來滅後若聞此經不生毀呰起隨喜心」，當知是為深信解相；	三者、上品末說「如來滅後若聞此經不生毀呰起隨喜心」，當知是為深信解相；	011	Third, at the end of the superior chapter, it says, After the Tathagata's extinction, if one hears this sutra and does not give rise to slander but gives rise to a mind of rejoicing, one should know that this is the mark of profound faith and understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c23_10']	今欲說其功德，故有此品來也。	今欲說其功德，故有此品來也。	011	Now, wishing to explain its merits, this chapter comes forth.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c24_7']	四者、欲舉劣顯勝歎其功德勸物宣持。	四者、欲舉劣顯勝歎其功德勸物宣持。	011	Fourth, wishing to take the inferior to illustrate the superior and praise its merits, encouraging people to proclaim and uphold it.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c25_7']	但默念隨喜福已無邊，況復書持讀誦等耶？	但默念隨喜福已無邊，況復書持讀誦等耶？	011	But the merit of silently rejoicing is already boundless, let alone copying, upholding, reading, reciting, and so forth?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0612c28_2']	五者、上品明受持供養此經功德無量，復有人不能書持更謂不得功德，是故今明若不能書持，但起隨喜心福亦無邊。	五者、上品明受持供養此經功德無量，復有人不能書持更謂不得功德，是故今明若不能書持，但起隨喜心福亦無邊。	011	Fifth, the superior chapter clarifies that the merit of receiving and upholding this sutra is immeasurable. There are also people who cannot copy and uphold it, thinking that they will not obtain merit. Therefore, it is now clarified that if one cannot copy and uphold it, but merely gives rise to a mind of rejoicing, the merit is also boundless.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a02_2']	又流通此經命初辨〈隨喜品〉者，此經明二權二實，與昔說相違，執教之徒逆耳違心不能信受，是故今明隨喜功德無邊，即是勸信解。	又流通此經命初辨〈隨喜品〉者，此經明二權二實，與昔說相違，執教之徒逆耳違心不能信受，是故今明隨喜功德無邊，即是勸信解。	011	Moreover, the reason why the chapter on rejoicing is explained first in the transmission of this sutra is that this sutra clarifies the two provisional and two real, which contradicts the teachings of the past. Those who cling to the teachings cannot accept it with ears against and minds in opposition, therefore, it is now clarified that the merit of rejoicing is boundless, which is to encourage faith and understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a02_4']	問：	問：	011	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a02_13']	何人聞經不生隨喜？	何人聞經不生隨喜？	011	What kind of people hear the sutra and do not give rise to rejoicing?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a02_15']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a03_8']	〈見塔品〉中已出六人，今明四種：	〈見塔品〉中已出六人，今明四種：	011	The six kinds of people are already mentioned in the chapter on seeing the stupa. Now, four kinds are clarified:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a04_13']	一者、學小乘人保執昔教，聞二權二實逆耳違心不生隨喜。	一者、學小乘人保執昔教，聞二權二實逆耳違心不生隨喜。	011	First, those who study the Lesser Vehicle cling to the teachings of the past. Hearing the two provisional and two real goes against their ears and contradicts their minds, so they do not give rise to rejoicing.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a07_10']	二者、執此經猶是無常因果猶未究竟，若聞一乘之因辨有佛性、一乘之果常住不滅，亦逆耳違心不生信受，故不生隨喜。	二者、執此經猶是無常因果猶未究竟，若聞一乘之因辨有佛性、一乘之果常住不滅，亦逆耳違心不生信受，故不生隨喜。	011	Second, those who cling to this sutra as still being of impermanent cause and effect, if they hear the cause of the One Vehicle that clarifies the Buddha-nature and the effect of the One Vehicle that is eternally abiding and not extinguished, it also goes against their ears and contradicts their minds, so they do not give rise to faith and acceptance, therefore, they do not give rise to rejoicing.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a09_11']	三者、執覆相常人聞此經開方便門、示真實相究竟無餘了義之說，亦逆耳違心不生隨喜。	三者、執覆相常人聞此經開方便門、示真實相究竟無餘了義之說，亦逆耳違心不生隨喜。	011	Third, those who cling to the provisional and conceal the true, upon hearing this sutra opening the provisional gate and revealing the ultimate truth of the definitive teaching, will also find it contrary to their ears and minds and will not give rise to joy.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a11_9']	四者、有所得人保權執實，若聞非權非實、無依無得謂是斷見，亦逆耳違心不生隨喜。	四者、有所得人保權執實，若聞非權非實、無依無得謂是斷見，亦逆耳違心不生隨喜。	011	Fourth, those who cling to the provisional and the real, upon hearing of the non-provisional, non-real, non-dependent, and non-attainment, will consider it a view of annihilation, and it will also be contrary to their ears and minds, and they will not give rise to joy.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a12_4']	故隨喜者難得，所以功德多也。	故隨喜者難得，所以功德多也。	011	Therefore, those who rejoice are difficult to find, and that is why their merit is great.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a12_6']	問：	問：	011	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a12_14']	云何名隨喜相耶？	云何名隨喜相耶？	011	What is meant by the characteristic of rejoicing?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a12_16']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a14_4']	二段經各有體用，乘權乘實體用者，不三不一、言斷意忘謂乘體；	二段經各有體用，乘權乘實體用者，不三不一、言斷意忘謂乘體；	011	Each of the two sections of the sutra has its essence and function. As for the essence and function of the provisional and real vehicles, not three and not one, with words cut off and the mind forgotten, this is the essence of the vehicle;
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a15_1']	昔為物說三、今破三說一謂乘用也。	昔為物說三、今破三說一謂乘用也。	011	In the past, for the sake of beings, it was said that there are three, and now, breaking down the three, it is said that there is one, which is the function of the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a16_15']	身權身實中體用者，法身非常無常，命不長不短，亦言斷意忘，謂佛身體也。	身權身實中體用者，法身非常無常，命不長不短，亦言斷意忘，謂佛身體也。	011	As for the essence and function of the provisional and real bodies, the Dharma body is neither permanent nor impermanent, and the life span is neither long nor short, also with words cut off and the mind forgotten, this is the body of the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a17_11']	昔無常今常，昔短今長，謂身用也。	昔無常今常，昔短今長，謂身用也。	011	In the past, impermanence was permanent, and in the past, shortness was now long, referring to the function of the body.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a18_11']	隨順二權二實體用而生歡喜，故有隨喜相也。	隨順二權二實體用而生歡喜，故有隨喜相也。	011	In accordance with the two provisional and two real essence and function, joy arises, so there is the appearance of sympathetic joy.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a18_13']	問：	問：	011	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a18_19']	隨喜有幾種？	隨喜有幾種？	011	How many kinds of sympathetic joy are there?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a18_21']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a19_4']	略有二種：	略有二種：	011	In brief, there are two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a19_10']	一、隨喜法；	一、隨喜法；	011	First, sympathetic joy in the Dharma;
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a19_16']	二、隨喜人。	二、隨喜人。	011	Second, sympathetic joy in the person.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a21_4']	隨喜法者，若順此經而生歡喜，即是金剛般若，信心不逆故名隨喜。	隨喜法者，若順此經而生歡喜，即是金剛般若，信心不逆故名隨喜。	011	As for sympathetic joy in the Dharma, if one gives rise to joy in accordance with this sutra, it is the Diamond Prajna Paramita, because the faithful mind does not go against it, it is called sympathetic joy.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a22_17']	二、隨前人所作而生歡喜，如見受持此經乃至解說而生歡喜，故名隨喜人。	二、隨前人所作而生歡喜，如見受持此經乃至解說而生歡喜，故名隨喜人。	011	Second, giving rise to joy in accordance with the actions of the person in front, such as seeing someone upholding this sutra and even explaining it, and giving rise to joy, therefore it is called sympathetic joy in the person.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a22_19']	問：	問：	011	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a23_14']	能隨喜心與所隨喜事，優劣云何？	能隨喜心與所隨喜事，優劣云何？	011	How does the mind that is able to sympathize compare with the matter that is sympathized with?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a23_16']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a23_20']	有四句：	有四句：	011	There are four possibilities:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a25_3']	一者、俱無優劣，所隨喜是無所得，能隨喜亦無所得。	一者、俱無優劣，所隨喜是無所得，能隨喜亦無所得。	011	First, there is no difference in superiority or inferiority, the matter that is sympathized with is non-attainment, and the ability to sympathize is also non-attainment.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a26_7']	二者、能所俱劣，所隨喜是有所得，能隨喜亦是有所得。	二者、能所俱劣，所隨喜是有所得，能隨喜亦是有所得。	011	Second, both the object and the subject are inferior. The object of sympathetic joy is with gain, and the subject of sympathetic joy is also with gain.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a27_11']	三者、所隨喜勝、能隨喜劣，如凡夫隨喜聖人所作善根。	三者、所隨喜勝、能隨喜劣，如凡夫隨喜聖人所作善根。	011	Third, the object of sympathetic joy is superior, and the subject of sympathetic joy is inferior. For example, ordinary beings sympathetically rejoice in the wholesome roots created by sages.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a28_16']	四者、能隨喜勝、所隨喜劣，如聖人隨喜凡夫所作善根。	四者、能隨喜勝、所隨喜劣，如聖人隨喜凡夫所作善根。	011	Fourth, the subject of sympathetic joy is superior, and the object of sympathetic joy is inferior. For example, sages sympathetically rejoice in the wholesome roots created by ordinary beings.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613a28_18']	問：	問：	011	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b03_4']	《大品經》明有所得隨喜迴向是雜毒食，雜毒食者初食雖美後則害身，有所得隨喜初感人天之報，後必受生老病死憂悲苦惱，今明何等隨喜耶？	《大品經》明有所得隨喜迴向是雜毒食，雜毒食者初食雖美後則害身，有所得隨喜初感人天之報，後必受生老病死憂悲苦惱，今明何等隨喜耶？	011	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra states that sympathetic joy and dedication with gain are like poisoned food. Poisoned food is delicious at first but harmful to the body later. Sympathetic joy with gain initially brings the rewards of human and heavenly realms, but later one will inevitably experience birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, suffering, and distress. What kind of sympathetic joy is being discussed now?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b03_6']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b05_10']	佛意明隨喜《法華》，《法華》是無所得法，即是波若，故前格量中舉五度除於波若，故知作無所得隨喜。	佛意明隨喜《法華》，《法華》是無所得法，即是波若，故前格量中舉五度除於波若，故知作無所得隨喜。	011	The Buddha's intention is to clarify the sympathetic joy in the Lotus Sūtra. The Lotus Sūtra is the Dharma of no gain, which is prajñā. Therefore, in the previous section on evaluation, the five perfections are mentioned except for prajñā. Therefore, it is known that the sympathetic joy without gain is created.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b07_3']	又若作有所得隨喜者，有所得還感世間果報，云何能勝後財、法二施耶？	又若作有所得隨喜者，有所得還感世間果報，云何能勝後財、法二施耶？	011	Moreover, if one rejoices with acquisition, with acquisition one will still receive worldly rewards. How can it surpass the later generosity of wealth and Dharma?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b07_5']	問：	問：	011	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b08_4']	有能隨喜心、有所隨喜事，云何成無所得耶？	有能隨喜心、有所隨喜事，云何成無所得耶？	011	There is a mind that rejoices and there are things to rejoice in. How can it be accomplished without acquisition?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b08_6']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b08_16']	既稱能所，即是因緣。	既稱能所，即是因緣。	011	Since it is called subject and object, it is cause and condition.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b10_9']	故能不自能，能名所能，所不自所，所名能所，如此能所無有自性，即是寂滅。	故能不自能，能名所能，所不自所，所名能所，如此能所無有自性，即是寂滅。	011	Therefore the subject is not able by itself. The subject is called the object. The object is not the object by itself. The object is called the subject and object. Such subject and object have no intrinsic nature, which is quiescent extinction.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b12_7', 'ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b13_12']	故《中論》云「因緣所生法即是寂滅性」，言寂滅者蓋是能所宛然未嘗能所，故稱寂滅。🔽寂滅宛然而不失能所，能所宛然而寂滅，即是方便實慧；	故《中論》云「因緣所生法即是寂滅性」，言寂滅者蓋是能所宛然未嘗能所，故稱寂滅。 寂滅宛然而不失能所，能所宛然而寂滅，即是方便實慧；	011	Therefore the Madhyamaka-śāstra says, The dharmas produced by causes and conditions are precisely the nature of quiescent extinction. The so-called quiescent extinction is precisely the subject and object being distinct, never being subject and object. Therefore it is called quiescent extinction.🔽Quiescent extinction is distinct, yet it does not lose the subject and object. The subject and object are distinct, yet they are quiescent extinction. This is precisely skillful means and true wisdom;
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b14_7']	寂滅宛然而能所即是實慧方便。	寂滅宛然而能所即是實慧方便。	011	Quiescent extinction is distinct, yet it is the subject and object, which is precisely true wisdom and skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b15_18']	故《大品》云「菩薩隨喜欲不墮想心見三顛倒者，當用波若方便力」也。	故《大品》云「菩薩隨喜欲不墮想心見三顛倒者，當用波若方便力」也。	011	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra says, If a bodhisattva wishes to avoid falling into the three inverted views of thought, mind, and seeing while rejoicing, he should use the power of prajñā and skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b15_20']	問：	問：	011	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b17_2']	四等中喜、禪支中喜、七覺中喜、五受中喜，與今何異？	四等中喜、禪支中喜、七覺中喜、五受中喜，與今何異？	011	How is this different from joy among the four immeasurables, joy among the factors of meditation, joy among the seven factors of enlightenment, and joy among the five feelings?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b17_4']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b19_12']	四等喜是慶他得樂，禪支中喜是自慶有所除得，五受中喜此通垢淨自他，七覺中喜但是無漏，與今並異也。	四等喜是慶他得樂，禪支中喜是自慶有所除得，五受中喜此通垢淨自他，七覺中喜但是無漏，與今並異也。	011	The joy of the four immeasurables is rejoicing in others' attainment of happiness. The joy among the factors of meditation is rejoicing in oneself for having eliminated and attained something. The joy among the five feelings is common to both defiled and pure states of self and others. The joy among the seven factors of enlightenment is only uncontaminated. They are all different from the present [joy].

['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b20_8']	但作無得隨喜亦作有得隨喜耶？	但作無得隨喜亦作有得隨喜耶？	011	Is it only rejoicing without attainment or also rejoicing with attainment?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b20_10']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b21_17']	始行菩薩未堪習無得觀，但作有得隨喜，猶勝逆耳之人也。	始行菩薩未堪習無得觀，但作有得隨喜，猶勝逆耳之人也。	011	Beginner bodhisattvas are not yet able to cultivate the contemplation of non-attainment. They only rejoice with attainment, which is still superior to those who go against the ear.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b22_1']	品為二：	品為二：	011	The chapter is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0613b22_7']	初問，次答。	初問，次答。	011	First, a question; second, an answer.

Then we know that the six faculties are all endowed with a hundred merits. Each merit is adorned with the ten wholesome deeds, forming one thousand merits. Each faculty has one thousand, making six thousand. But the three faculties that engage in the matter of propagating the sūtra have superior merit and thus more.

['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b19_25']	一者、《婆沙》云「三根合中知，謂鼻、舌、身，三根離中知，謂眼、耳、意」。	一者、《婆沙》云「三根合中知，謂鼻、舌、身，三根離中知，謂眼、耳、意」。	011	First, the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra says, The three faculties of nose, tongue, and body know through contact, while the three faculties of eye, ear, and mind know through separation.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b20_19']	《雜心》云「二根離中知，意不當離合也」。	《雜心》云「二根離中知，意不當離合也」。	011	The Saṃyuktâbhidharmahṛdaya says, The two faculties know through separation, but the mind should not be separated or combined.

The ear faculty both combines and separates, hearing external sounds is separation, hearing the sound of the ears is combination. The mind faculty is neither separated nor combined. Why is it said now that the nose remotely smells?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b23_14']	答：	答：	011	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b23_18']	舊釋云：	舊釋云：	011	The old explanation says:
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b24_16']	任根常用則如上三釋，今依經力故鼻能遙聞。	任根常用則如上三釋，今依經力故鼻能遙聞。	011	If the faculties are used according to their usual functions, then there are the above three explanations. Now, based on the power of the sūtra, the nose can remotely smell.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b26_9']	《法華論》云「一根具六用，而言鼻遙聞香者，此是知境勝用，鼻根知故」。	《法華論》云「一根具六用，而言鼻遙聞香者，此是知境勝用，鼻根知故」。	011	The Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra Treatise says, One faculty has the six functions. As for saying that the nose remotely smells fragrances, this is the superior function of knowing the objects, because the nose faculty knows.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b27_5']	此意鼻根既具六用，豈不能遙聞香耶？	此意鼻根既具六用，豈不能遙聞香耶？	011	Since this mind and nose faculties have six functions, how can they not be able to smell distant fragrances?
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615b28_10']	蓋是菩薩無六而六、權智巧用，若六而無六即未曾用也。	蓋是菩薩無六而六、權智巧用，若六而無六即未曾用也。	011	This is the skillful function of the bodhisattva's expedient wisdom, which is both six and not six. If it is six but not six, then it has never been used.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615c01_7']	無六而六名實方便，六而無六為方便實，持經人既悟此經具足二慧故能爾也。	無六而六名實方便，六而無六為方便實，持經人既悟此經具足二慧故能爾也。	011	Not six but six is called real expedient, and six but not six is expedient reality. The person who upholds the sūtra has realized that this sūtra is replete with the two wisdoms, and therefore can do so.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615c03_17']	《普賢觀》意亦爾，知六即實相故知六常無六，悟實相即六根故無六而常六，故六不六無礙，此是悟有無無礙。	《普賢觀》意亦爾，知六即實相故知六常無六，悟實相即六根故無六而常六，故六不六無礙，此是悟有無無礙。	011	The meaning of the Samantabhadra Contemplation is also like this. Knowing that the six are the true reality, one knows that the six are always without six. Realizing that the true reality is the six sense faculties, there is no six but always six. Therefore, the six are without obstruction in being not six. This is realizing the unobstructedness of existence and non-existence.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615c05_1']	又就有中六根自無礙，能一根為六用、六根為一用。	又就有中六根自無礙，能一根為六用、六根為一用。	011	Moreover, within existence, the six sense faculties are themselves unobstructed. One sense faculty can function as the six faculties, and the six sense faculties can function as one faculty.
['ZH_T34_1721_011:0615c06_16']	《華嚴》云「眼入三昧、耳出正受，觀眼無生無自性，說空寂滅無所有」，即其證也。	《華嚴》云「眼入三昧、耳出正受，觀眼無生無自性，說空寂滅無所有」，即其證也。	011	The Huayan says, The eyes enter samādhi, and the ears emerge from right concentration. Observing the eyes as unborn and without self-nature, speaking of emptiness, quiescence, extinction, and non-existence. This is the evidence.

The great being has sharp faculties and does not fail to discern any dust, so it is said one smells the fragrance of the Brahma world.

In terms of conditions, they are not Buddhas. It is like the elder seeing the poor son as his own child, but the poor son himself thinks he is a hired worker and not the elder's son. Therefore, the present Buddha becomes a future Buddha in terms of conditions.
