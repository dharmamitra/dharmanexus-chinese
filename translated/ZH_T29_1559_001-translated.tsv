If that were so, then cultivating the other antidotal paths would be empty and without result.

['ZH_T29_1559_001:0162b24_1']	釋曰：	釋曰：	001	The explanation states:

['ZH_T29_1559_001:0162c14_11']	是言所應義名言依，由執有義言故。	是言所應義名言依，由執有義言故。	001	The meaning that corresponds to this speech is called the basis of speech, because it is the speech that grasps the meaning.
['ZH_T29_1559_001:0162c15_2']	佛經說有為法名言依。	佛經說有為法名言依。	001	The Buddha's sutras say that conditioned dharmas are called the basis of speech.
