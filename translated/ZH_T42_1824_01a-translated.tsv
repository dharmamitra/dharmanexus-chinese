['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0010b23_2']	但是拆法明無生。	但是拆法明無生。	01a	However, this is the manifestation of non-arising through dismantling dharmas.

['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0010c28_5']	然世諦生滅是無生滅生滅。	然世諦生滅是無生滅生滅。	01a	However, the birth and cessation of the conventional truth is the birth and cessation of non-birth and non-cessation.
['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0010c28_18']	第一義無生滅是生滅無生滅。	第一義無生滅是生滅無生滅。	01a	The non-birth and non-cessation of the ultimate truth is the non-birth and non-cessation of birth and cessation.

['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0011a06_13']	二者此論既稱中論。	二者此論既稱中論。	01a	Second, since this treatise is called the Middle Treatise,
['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0011a07_3']	故就八不明於中道。	故就八不明於中道。	01a	therefore, the middle way is not discussed in the eight.
['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0011a07_12']	中道雖多不出三種。	中道雖多不出三種。	01a	Although the middle way is numerous, it does not go beyond the three kinds.

['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0011a11_5']	實法滅故不常。	實法滅故不常。	01a	Because real dharmas cease, they are not permanent.
['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0011a11_13']	假名相續故不斷。	假名相續故不斷。	01a	Because provisional names continue, they are not cut off.
['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0011a12_4']	不常不斷名世諦中道。	不常不斷名世諦中道。	01a	Not permanent and not cut off is called the middle way of the conventional truth.
['ZH_T42_1824_01a:0011a12_12']	今謂不常猶是斷。	今謂不常猶是斷。	01a	Now, saying it is not permanent is still annihilation.
