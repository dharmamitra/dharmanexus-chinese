['ZH_T36_1736_080:0625c22_7']	一者覺是能覺，心是所覺。	一者覺是能覺，心是所覺。	First, awakening is the ability to awaken, and the mind is what is awakened.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0625c23_9']	心是初相，即業相，是微細念，最初迷真，不覺心動。	心是初相，即業相，是微細念，最初迷真，不覺心動。	The mind is the initial characteristic, which is the characteristic of activity, which is subtle thought. Initially, it is deluded about truth, and the mind moves without awareness.

The meaning is also included in the previous, because without subtle thoughts, there are no characteristics of awareness.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0625c28_10']	由依法相，化身有始有終，報身有始無終，法身無始無終。	由依法相，化身有始有終，報身有始無終，法身無始無終。	Based on the characteristics of dharmas, the transformation body has a beginning and an end, the reward body has a beginning but no end, and the dharma body has neither beginning nor end.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a01_3']	今符於理，報亦無始，故云「始覺同本覺，無復始本之異，名究竟覺。	今符於理，報亦無始，故云「始覺同本覺，無復始本之異，名究竟覺。	Now in accord with principle, the reward body also has no beginning, therefore it says the initially awakened is the same as the originally awakened, and there is no longer a distinction between initial and original, called ultimate awakening.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a01_18']	」故云「無前際故」，則無始也。	」故云「無前際故」，則無始也。	Therefore it says because there is no prior limit, which means no beginning.

['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a08_18']	今初，經云「離邊」，未知何是，故舉晉經，及取下釋，略舉四種，以等一切。	今初，經云「離邊」，未知何是，故舉晉經，及取下釋，略舉四種，以等一切。	First, the sutra says transcending extremes, but it is not known what these are, so the Jin edition is cited, and the following explanation is taken. Four kinds are briefly mentioned, equating them with all.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a10_2']	染淨約惑，縛脫通惑業，有無通事理，一異約心境。	染淨約惑，縛脫通惑業，有無通事理，一異約心境。	Contaminated and pure are based on delusions, bondage and liberation are common to delusions and karma, existence and non-existence are common to phenomena and principles, and identity and difference are based on mind and objects.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a10_7']	何以有此？	何以有此？	Why are there these?
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a11_12']	謂成菩提既離細念，妄惑盡矣，顯現法身智慧純淨。	謂成菩提既離細念，妄惑盡矣，顯現法身智慧純淨。	It is said that in attaining enlightenment, once subtle thoughts are transcended, false delusions are exhausted, and the Dharma body and wisdom are manifested as pure.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a12_3']	若為此見，未免是邊。	若為此見，未免是邊。	If one has this view, one is not yet free from extremes.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a13_13']	故上經云「若有見正覺，解脫離諸漏，不著一切世，彼非證道眼。	故上經云「若有見正覺，解脫離諸漏，不著一切世，彼非證道眼。	Therefore, the above sutra says, If there is one who sees right enlightenment, liberation, and freedom from defilements, not attached to anything in the world, that is not the eye of realizing the Way.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a14_13']	」今了於惑體性本空，後無所淨，故離二邊。	」今了於惑體性本空，後無所淨，故離二邊。	Now, understanding that the essence of delusions is originally empty, and there is nothing to be purified later, one thus transcends the two extremes.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a15_8']	又染淨交徹，故無住著，是曰離邊。	又染淨交徹，故無住著，是曰離邊。	Moreover, because defilement and purity interpenetrate, there is no attachment, which is called transcending extremes.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a16_15']	縛脫者，謂昔常被惑業繫縛流轉無窮，今得菩提釋然解脫。	縛脫者，謂昔常被惑業繫縛流轉無窮，今得菩提釋然解脫。	As for bondage and liberation, it means that one was formerly always bound by afflictions and karmic actions, wandering without end, but now attaining enlightenment and being completely liberated.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a17_7']	若為此見，即是住邊。	若為此見，即是住邊。	If one has this view, it is abiding in extremes.
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a18_2']	菩提智了，本自無縛，於何有解？	菩提智了，本自無縛，於何有解？	The wisdom of enlightenment understands that one has never been bound, so how can there be liberation?
['ZH_T36_1736_080:0626a18_16']	無縛無解則無樂厭，故得離耳。	無縛無解則無樂厭，故得離耳。	Without bondage and without liberation, there is neither delight nor aversion, so one can attain transcendence.
