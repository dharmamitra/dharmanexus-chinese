['ZH_T36_1736_071:0564c22_3']	順現受業，其力最勝，必受生報。	順現受業，其力最勝，必受生報。	Karma that accords with present retribution has the strongest power and must receive a rebirth.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0564c23_6']	後報若順生受，其力稍劣，必受後受，不受現受。	後報若順生受，其力稍劣，必受後受，不受現受。	If the later retribution accords with present retribution, its power is slightly weaker, and one must receive later retribution, not present retribution.

['ZH_T36_1736_071:0564c27_1']	義似有餘，或有各造，一生之業人天並造，先受人報，後受於天，豈要令其重受人耶？	義似有餘，或有各造，一生之業人天並造，先受人報，後受於天，豈要令其重受人耶？	The meaning is similar to the remaining [karmas], or there may be each one's creation. One who creates karma for both humans and gods creates first for human retribution, and later for heavenly retribution. How can it be necessary to make them repeatedly experience being human?
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0564c27_12']	然此三受，略說有三因：	然此三受，略說有三因：	However, these three experiences are generally said to have three causes:
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0564c29_8']	一由於因，如於佛僧慈定滅定及無諍定，見修道中作供養者，得現樂報；	一由於因，如於佛僧慈定滅定及無諍定，見修道中作供養者，得現樂報；	First, due to the cause. For example, those who make offerings to the Buddha, the Saṅgha, the meditation of loving-kindness, the meditation of cessation, and the meditation of non-conflict, in the path of seeing and the path of cultivation, attain the retribution of present happiness;
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565a01_4']	於父母王等作損惱業，得現苦報。	於父母王等作損惱業，得現苦報。	Those who harm their parents, the king, and others, attain the retribution of present suffering.

['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565a05_12']	多罪之人都無現報，以造重惡趣生報故，諸相好業皆得後報，不可一生即成佛故。	多罪之人都無現報，以造重惡趣生報故，諸相好業皆得後報，不可一生即成佛故。	For those with much sin, there is no retribution in the present life at all, because they create grave evil leading to rebirth retribution. The karmas for the major and minor marks all attain the retribution of the later life, because it is not possible to attain Buddhahood in just one lifetime.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565a06_14']	又諸輪王多受後報，劫減修因，劫增受果故。	又諸輪王多受後報，劫減修因，劫增受果故。	Moreover, the various wheel-turning kings mostly receive the later retribution. When the eon decreases, they cultivate the causes. When the eon increases, they receive the fruits.

This means that the fruit and the time are both indefinite, but there is only the definiteness of the fruit, not the definiteness of the time.

['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b10_5']	前二時定者，以現若受名現報業，現若不受非現報業。	前二時定者，以現若受名現報業，現若不受非現報業。	As for the two definite times, if the present [life] experiences [the result], it is called karma with results in the present life. If the present [life] does not experience [the result], it is not karma with results in the present life.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b11_10']	生報亦然，要次生受方名生報，故說前二時則定也。	生報亦然，要次生受方名生報，故說前二時則定也。	The same is true for results in the next life. One must experience [the result] in the next life in order for it to be called karma with results in the next life. Therefore, it is said that the first two have definite times.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b13_7']	「報通定不定」者，有造現報之業，應合現受，更遇勝緣排而不受，此報不定。	「報通定不定」者，有造現報之業，應合現受，更遇勝緣排而不受，此報不定。	As for the results are both definite and indefinite, there is karma with results in the present life that should be experienced in the present life, but one encounters superior conditions that push it back and one does not experience it. This result is indefinite.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b13_12']	生報亦爾。	生報亦爾。	The same is true for results in the next life.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b14_8']	無有移此更別時故，無時不定也。	無有移此更別時故，無時不定也。	There is no shifting of this to another time, so there is no indefinite time.

['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b18_1']	謂順後受不定業，有業定受而不定，一生二生多生故，是報定時不定。	謂順後受不定業，有業定受而不定，一生二生多生故，是報定時不定。	This means that indeterminate karma to be experienced in a later life may be experienced but not definitely so, in one, two, or many lifetimes, so the retribution is definite but the time is indefinite.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b19_10']	有不定業，於第三生應合受之，遇緣業壞，是為時定報不定也。	有不定業，於第三生應合受之，遇緣業壞，是為時定報不定也。	There is indeterminate karma that should be experienced in the third lifetime, but encountering conditions, the karma is destroyed, so the time is definite but the retribution is indefinite.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b20_15']	或復有業未定生數而受果報，忽遇緣壞，故俱不定。	或復有業未定生數而受果報，忽遇緣壞，故俱不定。	Or there may be karma whose number of lifetimes is indefinite, but the fruition is experienced, suddenly encountering conditions and destroying it, so both are indefinite.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b22_2']	然《俱舍》中報定時不定，義通三報，今何就於順於受耶？	然《俱舍》中報定時不定，義通三報，今何就於順於受耶？	However, in the Abhidharma-kośa, karma whose retribution is definite but time indefinite applies to the three kinds of retribution. Why is it now discussed only in terms of karma to be experienced in the present lifetime?
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b22_4', 'ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b23_5']	答：🔽《俱舍》以業就時，謂有業定受，而或現或生或後。	答： 《俱舍》以業就時，謂有業定受，而或現或生或後。	The answer is:🔽The Abhidharma-kośa discusses karma in terms of time, meaning there is karma whose retribution is definite, but which may be experienced in the present lifetime, the next lifetime, or a later lifetime.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b24_3']	今明以時取業，要現受報方名現業。	今明以時取業，要現受報方名現業。	Now, it is explained that time is taken in terms of karma. Only karma whose retribution is experienced in the present lifetime is called present karma.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b25_11']	現若受者即現定業，現若不受即非現業，故無現報時不定也。	現若受者即現定業，現若不受即非現業，故無現報時不定也。	If one experiences it in the present, it is a present definite karma. If one does not experience it in the present, it is not a present karma. Therefore, there is no uncertainty in the time of retribution for present [karma].
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b27_2']	若是生受即是生業，不受則非生報之業，故無生報時不定也。	若是生受即是生業，不受則非生報之業，故無生報時不定也。	If it is to be experienced in the next life, it is a karma to be experienced in the next life. If it is not experienced, it is not a karma to be experienced in the next life. Therefore, there is no uncertainty in the time of retribution for karma to be experienced in the next life.

['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565b29_11']	或合受生報，由異因緣，便受後報。	或合受生報，由異因緣，便受後報。	Or it should be experienced in the next life, but due to other conditions it is experienced in a later life.

After seven days, she was reborn in heaven again.

['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565c04_18']	現報緣排而受生者，即是生報，不名現報時不定也。	現報緣排而受生者，即是生報，不名現報時不定也。	The one who experiences the retribution in the next life by pushing back the conditions for present retribution is experiencing the retribution in the next life, not the present retribution with uncertain time.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565c05_9']	生報亦然，思之可解。	生報亦然，思之可解。	The same is true for the retribution of rebirth, which can be understood through contemplation.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565c06_4']	對前三師，疏意便當第四師也。	對前三師，疏意便當第四師也。	The meaning of the commentary is equivalent to the fourth teacher when compared to the previous three teachers.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565c07_4']	業力甚深，不妨廣解，或當更有餘經論明。	業力甚深，不妨廣解，或當更有餘經論明。	The power of karma is extremely profound, and it is not contradictory to explain it extensively. Perhaps there are other sutras and treatises that clarify this.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565c08_11']	疏「定者難度」等者，此約非乘及與二乘各於自分而已定者。	疏「定者難度」等者，此約非乘及與二乘各於自分而已定者。	The commentary states those of fixed potential are difficult to liberate and so on, which refers to those of non-vehicle and the two vehicles who are each fixed in their own stage.
['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565c09_12']	大乘若定，更不須度，是故不言定者易度。	大乘若定，更不須度，是故不言定者易度。	If those of the Mahayana are fixed, they do not need to be liberated, so it does not say those of fixed potential are easy to liberate.

['ZH_T36_1736_071:0565c11_14']	惑依根有，勝劣性有差異。	惑依根有，勝劣性有差異。	Afflictions depend on faculties, with differences in superiority and inferiority.
