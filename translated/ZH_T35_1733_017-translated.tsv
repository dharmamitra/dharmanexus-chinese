Therefore, one always abides in the mundane world and has never left it.
['ZH_T35_1733_017:0419a16_12']	二悲無不智故離無不世，是故恒超世表無不遊世。	二悲無不智故離無不世，是故恒超世表無不遊世。	017	Second, compassion is always wisdom, so separation is always the world. Therefore, one always transcends the world and is not apart from wandering in the world.
['ZH_T35_1733_017:0419a17_12']	三雙融故動靜無二唯是一念，謂無念也。	三雙融故動靜無二唯是一念，謂無念也。	017	Third, the two are mutually fused, so movement and stillness are non-dual, and it is only a single thought, namely, no thought.

['ZH_T35_1733_017:0421c01_1']	二細剋而辨二百門行，一一皆悉徹於佛果，是故諸文之末悉皆結云「即得佛」等也，是則皆通因果二位。	二細剋而辨二百門行，一一皆悉徹於佛果，是故諸文之末悉皆結云「即得佛」等也，是則皆通因果二位。	017	2. In fine detail, the two hundred gates of practices are each and every one penetrating to the fruition of Buddhahood. Therefore, the end of the various texts all concludes by saying one immediately attains Buddhahood and so forth, which is then both causal and fruitional stages.
['ZH_T35_1733_017:0421c02_4']	三或總屬因位，以普賢位中亦現成佛攝生等故。	三或總屬因位，以普賢位中亦現成佛攝生等故。	017	3. Or they are generally categorized as causal stages, because in the stage of Samantabhadra one also manifests the attainment of Buddhahood and guiding sentient beings and so forth.

Or they are generally categorized as fruitional, because the following texts often say although one attains Buddhahood, one does not cease the practices of bodhisattvas. Therefore, these practices are all fruitional practices.

It is truly that one is able to be particular without destroying universality. This is Samantabhadra.
