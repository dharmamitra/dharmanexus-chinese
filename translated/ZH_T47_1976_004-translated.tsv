Even a bodhisattva accumulates roots of goodness in this way, accomplishes roots of goodness, increases roots of goodness, contemplates roots of goodness, fixes the mind on roots of goodness, discerns roots of goodness, loves roots of goodness, cultivates roots of goodness, and abides in roots of goodness. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, having accumulated such roots of goodness, attain the fruits of reliance based on these roots of goodness, cultivate bodhisattva practices, and in every thought see immeasurable buddhas, as appropriate, serving and making offerings to them.
