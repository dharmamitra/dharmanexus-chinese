['ZH_T29_1563_025:0892c14_17']	契經處處說業感有，然見世間已離染者，雖造善業，而無功能招後有果。	契經處處說業感有，然見世間已離染者，雖造善業，而無功能招後有果。	The scriptures say in various places that karma produces existence, but it is seen in the world that even though those who have already become free from defilements create wholesome karma, they lack the ability to attract the fruits of subsequent existence.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0892c15_7']	故於感有，業應非因。	故於感有，業應非因。	Therefore, in producing existence, karma should not be the cause.

['ZH_T29_1563_025:0892c23_15']	如是隨眠略有六種，謂貪、瞋、慢、無明、見、疑。	如是隨眠略有六種，謂貪、瞋、慢、無明、見、疑。	There are six kinds of latent afflictions: craving, hatred, pride, ignorance, views, and doubt.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0892c24_17']	頌說亦言顯同類義，謂瞋如貪雖有多類，而可總說為一隨眠。	頌說亦言顯同類義，謂瞋如貪雖有多類，而可總說為一隨眠。	The word “also” in the verse indicates the meaning of a common characteristic, that is, hatred is like craving in that although there are many varieties, they can be generally referred to as one latent affliction.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0892c25_8']	慢等亦然，故復言亦。	慢等亦然，故復言亦。	The same is true of pride and so on. Therefore, the word “also” is used.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0892c26_7']	或此為顯如貪與瞋行相不同，故別建立。	或此為顯如貪與瞋行相不同，故別建立。	Or this word is used to show that, like craving and hatred, their modes of activity are not the same, and therefore they are established separately.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0892c27_5']	如是慢等行相雖同，餘義有異故亦別立。	如是慢等行相雖同，餘義有異故亦別立。	The same is true of pride and so on: although their modes of activity are the same, they differ in other respects and therefore are established separately.

['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a03_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a05_10']	即前所說六隨眠中，分貪為二，故經說七，欲貪有貪相差別故，色無色愛佛說有貪，彼貪多託內門轉故。	即前所說六隨眠中，分貪為二，故經說七，欲貪有貪相差別故，色無色愛佛說有貪，彼貪多託內門轉故。	The six proclivities mentioned above are divided into two, craving and existence, because of the difference between craving for desire and craving for existence. The Buddha said that craving for existence is craving in the two upper realms, because that craving often occurs through the internal sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a07_3']	又於上二界有起解脫想，為遮彼執故立有名，以此有言目生身義。	又於上二界有起解脫想，為遮彼執故立有名，以此有言目生身義。	Moreover, in the two upper realms there is the notion of liberation. In order to refute this attachment, the term existence is established. This term existence refers to the meaning of the body of birth.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a08_11']	既說有貪在上二界，義准欲界貪名欲貪，故於頌中不別顯。	既說有貪在上二界，義准欲界貪名欲貪，故於頌中不別顯。	Since it is said that craving for existence is in the two upper realms, by implication craving in the desire realm is called craving for desire. Therefore it is not separately indicated in the verse.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a10_1']	示多緣五欲外門轉，故如前所說六種隨眠，復約異門建立為十。	示多緣五欲外門轉，故如前所說六種隨眠，復約異門建立為十。	It is shown that it often occurs through the external sense bases, taking the five desires as objects. Therefore, the six kinds of proclivities mentioned above are established as ten by a different method.

['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a28_5']	謂見苦諦所斷具十，一切皆違見苦諦故。	謂見苦諦所斷具十，一切皆違見苦諦故。	That is, those eliminated by the path of insight into the truth of suffering are associated with ten, because all of them oppose the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a29_6']	見集滅諦所斷各七，離有身見、邊見、戒取見。	見集滅諦所斷各七，離有身見、邊見、戒取見。	Those eliminated by the path of insight into the truths of origination and cessation are seven, because they are devoid of the view of the aggregates, extreme views, and the esteeming of views.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0893a29_19']	道諦所斷八，於前七增戒取。	道諦所斷八，於前七增戒取。	Those eliminated by the path of insight into the truth of the path are eight, because the above seven are increased by one, the esteeming of morality and the practice.

['ZH_T29_1563_025:0894a06_1']	於自在等非因計因，彼必不能觀察深理，但於自在等諸蘊麁果義，妄謂是常一我作者，此為上首，方執為因，是故此執見苦所斷。	於自在等非因計因，彼必不能觀察深理，但於自在等諸蘊麁果義，妄謂是常一我作者，此為上首，方執為因，是故此執見苦所斷。	When one considers that Īśvara and so on are causes, one is certainly not able to investigate profound principles. One only falsely considers the gross fruits of the aggregates of Īśvara and so on to be permanent, unitary, and a creator. This is the foremost consideration, and one then considers them to be causes. Therefore, this grasping is eliminated by the vision of suffering.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0894a07_18']	謂執我者是有身見，於苦果義妄執為我，故現觀苦我執即除，非我智生、非於後位。	謂執我者是有身見，於苦果義妄執為我，故現觀苦我執即除，非我智生、非於後位。	That is to say, the view of a self is the view of the five aggregates as a self. One falsely considers the meaning of the fruit of suffering to be a self. Therefore, when one realizes suffering, grasping a self is eliminated. The knowledge that there is no self is born, not in a subsequent state.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0894a10_7']	若有我見，見集等斷，於相續中我見隨故，即非我智應不得生，以見唯法時我見即滅故，非我智起我見已除。	若有我見，見集等斷，於相續中我見隨故，即非我智應不得生，以見唯法時我見即滅故，非我智起我見已除。	If there were a view of a self that was eliminated by the vision of the origination of suffering and so on, the view of a self would follow in one's stream of consciousness. Therefore, the knowledge that there is no self would not be born. This is because when one sees only dharmas, the view of a self is eliminated. The knowledge that there is no self arises when the view of a self is already eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0894a12_6']	然有我見，於自在等相續法中計一我已，次即於彼相續法上起邊執見，計度為常。	然有我見，於自在等相續法中計一我已，次即於彼相續法上起邊執見，計度為常。	However, there is the view of a self. Having already grasped a unitary self in the stream of consciousness of Īśvara and so on, one then gives rise to the extreme view of permanence with regard to that stream of consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1563_025:0894a15_15']	由此應知，於自在等法常我二執，唯見苦所斷，以非常等諸無漏行見苦諦時二見既滅，於自在等非因計因，隨二見生亦俱時滅，故說計因執唯見苦所斷。	由此應知，於自在等法常我二執，唯見苦所斷，以非常等諸無漏行見苦諦時二見既滅，於自在等非因計因，隨二見生亦俱時滅，故說計因執唯見苦所斷。	Therefore you should understand that the two views of permanence and self with regard to the dharmas of Īśvara, etc., are eliminated only by the path of insight into the truths of suffering and of the origin of suffering. When the two views are extinguished at the time of insight into the truth of suffering, the view that the cause of suffering is something other than the dharmas of Īśvara, etc., which is born with the two views, is also extinguished at the same time. Therefore it is said that the view that grasps a cause is eliminated only by the path of insight into the truths of suffering and of the origin of suffering.

['ZH_T29_1563_025:0894a29_19']	謂如邪見撥無真道，後即計此能得清淨，此戒禁取許見道斷。	謂如邪見撥無真道，後即計此能得清淨，此戒禁取許見道斷。	That is, just as wrong views deny the true path, one then imagines that it can obtain purification. This grasping of a tenet as superior is admitted to be eliminated by the vision of the truth of the path.
