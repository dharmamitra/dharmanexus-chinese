Another explanation is that those without faculties cannot receive precepts because when receiving precepts, they are first asked if they are men or women.
['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c01_2']	既無有根故不得戒。	既無有根故不得戒。	Since they do not have faculties, they cannot receive precepts.

['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c05_15']	亦應無根得不律儀。	亦應無根得不律儀。	It should also be the case that those without faculties can obtain non-discipline.

['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c07_14']	故漸死位得入見道。	故漸死位得入見道。	Therefore, in the state of gradual death, one can enter the path of seeing.
['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c08_2']	得不律儀等。	得不律儀等。	One obtains the non-disciplined and so forth.
['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c08_11']	非別厭離善法功德。	非別厭離善法功德。	It is not a separate disgust with the merits and virtues of the good dharmas.

['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c09_17']	厭生死。	厭生死。	one becomes disgusted with birth and death.
['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c10_1']	故。	故。	Therefore,
['ZH_T41_1821_003:0069c10_8']	何妨漸命終位。	何妨漸命終位。	how could it be that in the state of gradual death,
