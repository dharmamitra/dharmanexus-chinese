['ZH_T37_1752_001:0234a15_19']	有二解。	有二解。	There are two explanations.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0234a16_12']	一云報佛是修成佛，為地上說法。	一云報佛是修成佛，為地上說法。	The first says that the retribution Buddha is the Buddha of cultivation and accomplishment, and teaches those on the grounds.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0234a18_6']	二云為地上說法之報佛，然應化為報，非修成妙覺之報，此是化中之細耳。	二云為地上說法之報佛，然應化為報，非修成妙覺之報，此是化中之細耳。	The second says that the retribution Buddha who teaches those on the grounds is a response and transformation, not the retribution of the wondrous enlightenment of cultivation and accomplishment. This is just the subtle within the transformation.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0234a19_8']	化佛說者，化是隨緣之迹，故察緣吐教名為化說。	化佛說者，化是隨緣之迹，故察緣吐教名為化說。	As for the transformed Buddha's teaching, the transformation is the trace of following conditions, so observing the conditions and expounding the teachings is called the transformed teaching.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0234a20_9']	觀下是所說，就此所說有能觀所觀為第二雙。	觀下是所說，就此所說有能觀所觀為第二雙。	The lower part is what is spoken. In this what is spoken, there is the second pair of the able to observe and the observed.

['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b08_5']	所以謗法闡提不得生者，闡提不信法，臨終雖為說有無量壽佛，彼終不信，故不得往生。	所以謗法闡提不得生者，闡提不信法，臨終雖為說有無量壽佛，彼終不信，故不得往生。	The reason icchantikas who slander the Dharma cannot be reborn is because icchantikas do not believe in the Dharma. Even if the Buddha is explained to them at the time of death, they will not believe it, so they cannot be reborn there.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b09_14']	又謗法亦爾，如小乘人聞說有十方佛，不信，故不得往生也。	又謗法亦爾，如小乘人聞說有十方佛，不信，故不得往生也。	Furthermore, those who slander the Dharma are also like this. For example, when Hīnayāna practitioners hear that there are Buddhas in the ten directions, they do not believe it, so they cannot be reborn there.

['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b13_16']	遂彼修因，故得果有大小。	遂彼修因，故得果有大小。	Because it accords with the cultivation of causes, the attainment of the fruit has greatness and smallness.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b14_10']	上品修大乘因，故所以得大乘果；	上品修大乘因，故所以得大乘果；	The superior grade cultivates the causes of the Great Vehicle, and therefore attains the fruit of the Great Vehicle;
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b15_4']	中品修小乘因，故還得小乘果；	中品修小乘因，故還得小乘果；	The middle grade cultivates the causes of the Small Vehicle, and therefore still attains the fruit of the Small Vehicle;
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b17_10']	下品現在雖不修大乘善及小乘善，但彼臨終時遇善知識為說大乘妙法，以聞大乘，故得大乘果也。	下品現在雖不修大乘善及小乘善，但彼臨終時遇善知識為說大乘妙法，以聞大乘，故得大乘果也。	The inferior grade, although not cultivating the wholesome of the Great Vehicle or the wholesome of the Small Vehicle in the present, when they are at the point of death they encounter good and virtuous friends who expound the wonderful Dharma of the Great Vehicle for them. Because they hear the Great Vehicle, they attain the fruit of the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b18_14']	上品人善強果強、中品人善強果弱、下品人善弱果強。	上品人善強果強、中品人善強果弱、下品人善弱果強。	The wholesome of the superior person is strong and the fruit is strong, the wholesome of the middle person is strong and the fruit is weak, and the wholesome of the inferior person is weak and the fruit is strong.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b19_15']	上品人修大乘善得大乘果也，善強果亦強也。	上品人修大乘善得大乘果也，善強果亦強也。	Those of the highest grade cultivate the good of the Mahayana and attain the fruit of the Mahayana. The good is strong and the fruit is also strong.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b21_8']	中品人善強果弱者，修行禁戒世間等善而得小乘果，故善強果弱也。	中品人善強果弱者，修行禁戒世間等善而得小乘果，故善強果弱也。	Those of the middle grade have strong good but weak fruit. They practice the good of the world such as observing precepts and attain the fruit of the Hinayana, thus the good is strong but the fruit is weak.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b22_15']	下品善弱果強者，下品人都不修善而得大果，故善弱果強也。	下品善弱果強者，下品人都不修善而得大果，故善弱果強也。	Those of the lowest grade have weak good but strong fruit. Those of the lowest grade do not cultivate good at all but attain the great fruit, thus the good is weak but the fruit is strong.
['ZH_T37_1752_001:0245b24_14']	又下品所以得大果者，明彼現在雖不修善，過去或經發心，今聞大乘復得發心等也。	又下品所以得大果者，明彼現在雖不修善，過去或經發心，今聞大乘復得發心等也。	Moreover, the reason why those of the lowest grade attain the great fruit is that it clarifies that although they do not cultivate good in the present, in the past they may have gone through arousing the mind, and now hearing the Mahayana they again attain arousing the mind and so forth.
