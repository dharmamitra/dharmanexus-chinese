The eye is called predominant because it is supreme and sovereign in the consciousness that perceives form.

['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a11_11']	二性差別由女男根，故說女男根於二性增上，於眾同分住中命根有增上用，於雜染中樂等五受有增上用。	二性差別由女男根，故說女男根於二性增上，於眾同分住中命根有增上用，於雜染中樂等五受有增上用。	The differences in the two natures are due to the female and male faculties, therefore it is said that the female and male faculties have dominance over the two natures. In the abiding of the homogeneous collection, the life faculty has a dominant function. In defilement, the five feelings such as pleasure have a dominant function.

['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a13_10']	於樂受貪隨增，於苦受瞋隨增，於不苦不樂受無明隨增故。	於樂受貪隨增，於苦受瞋隨增，於不苦不樂受無明隨增故。	because craving increases in pleasant feeling, anger increases in painful feeling, and ignorance increases in neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a14_6']	於清淨中信等五根有增上用。	於清淨中信等五根有增上用。	The five faculties such as faith have a dominant influence in the pure path.

['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a17_2']	言應知者，勸許一一各能為根，三無漏根於得後後道涅槃等有增上用。	言應知者，勸許一一各能為根，三無漏根於得後後道涅槃等有增上用。	The phrase one should know encourages the understanding that each of these faculties can individually serve as a root. The three pure faculties have a dominant influence in attaining the subsequent paths, nirvāṇa, etc.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a21_2']	言亦爾者，類顯一一各能為根，謂未知當知根於得已知根道有增上用，已知根於得具知根道有增上用，具知根於得涅槃有增上用，非心未解脫能般涅槃故。	言亦爾者，類顯一一各能為根，謂未知當知根於得已知根道有增上用，已知根於得具知根道有增上用，具知根於得涅槃有增上用，非心未解脫能般涅槃故。	The phrase it is also so illustrates that each of these faculties can individually serve as a root. That is to say, the faculty of I shall come to know the unknown has a dominant influence in attaining the path of knowing (i.e., the second of the four noble paths). The faculty of knowing has a dominant influence in attaining the path of complete knowing (i.e., the third of the four noble paths). The faculty of complete knowing has a dominant influence in attaining nirvāṇa, because one who has not yet liberated the mind is unable to attain nirvāṇa.

['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a25_6']	謂見所斷煩惱滅中未知當知根有增上用，於修所斷煩惱滅中已知根有增上用，於現法樂住中具知根有增上用，由此能領受解脫喜樂故。	謂見所斷煩惱滅中未知當知根有增上用，於修所斷煩惱滅中已知根有增上用，於現法樂住中具知根有增上用，由此能領受解脫喜樂故。	That is, the faculty of one who is still learning has predominance in the cessation of the passions that are eliminated by the path of insight. The faculty of one who has finished learning has predominance in the cessation of the passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation. The faculty of one beyond training has predominance in the enjoyment of the pleasures of dhyāna and concentration, because one experiences the bliss of liberation by means of this faculty.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a27_5']	若增上故立為根者，無明等性應立為根，無明等因於行等果各各別有增上用故。	若增上故立為根者，無明等性應立為根，無明等因於行等果各各別有增上用故。	If predominance is the criterion for being a faculty, then such things as ignorance should be established as faculties, because the causes of such things as ignorance have a predominance over such things as the karmic forces.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a29_5']	又語具等應立為根，語具手足大小便處，於語執行棄樂事中如其次第有增上故。	又語具等應立為根，語具手足大小便處，於語執行棄樂事中如其次第有增上故。	Also, such things as the vocal organ should be established as faculties, because the vocal organ, hands, feet, anus, and sexual organs have predominance, respectively, in such activities as speaking, handling things, walking, defecating, and sexual intercourse.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014b01_6']	如是等事不應立根，由所許根有如是相。	如是等事不應立根，由所許根有如是相。	Such things as the vocal organ should not be established as faculties, because the characteristics of the faculties are as we have described them.

They are the equipment for purity by the five faculties such as faith. They are purified by the last three faculties. Therefore, the matter of establishing faculties is completely finished.
