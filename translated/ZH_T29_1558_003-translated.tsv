The eye is called predominant because it is supreme and sovereign in the consciousness that perceives form. This is because it is the common cause for perceiving various forms, and because the consciousness follows the eye faculty in being clear or dim.

['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a11_11']	二性差別由女男根，故說女男根於二性增上，於眾同分住中命根有增上用，於雜染中樂等五受有增上用。	二性差別由女男根，故說女男根於二性增上，於眾同分住中命根有增上用，於雜染中樂等五受有增上用。	003	The differences in the two natures are due to the female and male faculties, therefore it is said that the female and male faculties have dominance over the two natures. In the abiding of the homogeneous collection, the life faculty has a dominant function. In defilement, the five feelings such as pleasure have a dominant function.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a11_16']	所以者何？	所以者何？	003	Why is this?

['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a15_6']	由此勢力伏諸煩惱引聖道故。	由此勢力伏諸煩惱引聖道故。	003	Because by their power one subdues the defilements and attracts the noble path.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a17_2']	言應知者，勸許一一各能為根，三無漏根於得後後道涅槃等有增上用。	言應知者，勸許一一各能為根，三無漏根於得後後道涅槃等有增上用。	003	The phrase one should know encourages the understanding that each of these faculties can individually serve as a root. The three pure faculties have a dominant influence in attaining the subsequent paths, nirvāṇa, etc.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a21_2']	言亦爾者，類顯一一各能為根，謂未知當知根於得已知根道有增上用，已知根於得具知根道有增上用，具知根於得涅槃有增上用，非心未解脫能般涅槃故。	言亦爾者，類顯一一各能為根，謂未知當知根於得已知根道有增上用，已知根於得具知根道有增上用，具知根於得涅槃有增上用，非心未解脫能般涅槃故。	003	The phrase it is also so illustrates that each of these faculties can individually serve as a root. That is to say, the faculty of I shall come to know the unknown has a dominant influence in attaining the path of knowing (i.e., the second of the four noble paths). The faculty of knowing has a dominant influence in attaining the path of complete knowing (i.e., the third of the four noble paths). The faculty of complete knowing has a dominant influence in attaining nirvāṇa, because one who has not yet liberated the mind is unable to attain nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a21_11']	等言為顯復有異門。	等言為顯復有異門。	003	The word etc. is used to illustrate another aspect.

The faculty of one who has finished learning has predominance in the cessation of the passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation. The faculty of one beyond training has predominance in the enjoyment of the pleasures of dhyāna and concentration, because one experiences the bliss of liberation by means of this faculty.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a27_5']	若增上故立為根者，無明等性應立為根，無明等因於行等果各各別有增上用故。	若增上故立為根者，無明等性應立為根，無明等因於行等果各各別有增上用故。	003	If predominance is the criterion for being a faculty, then such things as ignorance should be established as faculties, because the causes of such things as ignorance have a predominance over such things as the karmic forces.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014a29_5']	又語具等應立為根，語具手足大小便處，於語執行棄樂事中如其次第有增上故。	又語具等應立為根，語具手足大小便處，於語執行棄樂事中如其次第有增上故。	003	Also, such things as the vocal organ should be established as faculties, because the vocal organ, hands, feet, anus, and sexual organs have predominance, respectively, in such activities as speaking, handling things, walking, defecating, and sexual intercourse.
['ZH_T29_1558_003:0014b01_6']	如是等事不應立根，由所許根有如是相。	如是等事不應立根，由所許根有如是相。	003	Such things as the vocal organ should not be established as faculties, because the characteristics of the faculties are as we have described them.
