['ZH_T39_1799_10b:0962a01_6']	萬法無因，虛妄生滅，今計有因是真常性，即與外道所執，冥諦是常，能生一切，無有差別，此即計阿賴耶識未形兆前冥然之初為冥諦也。	萬法無因，虛妄生滅，今計有因是真常性，即與外道所執，冥諦是常，能生一切，無有差別，此即計阿賴耶識未形兆前冥然之初為冥諦也。	The myriad dharmas have no cause, arising and ceasing in vain. Now, to calculate that there is a cause, which is the true and eternal nature, is no different from the eternal principle grasped by non-Buddhists, which is eternal and can give rise to everything.
