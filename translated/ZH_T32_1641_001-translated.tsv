['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b18_5']	論中解十六諦十六諦總問：	論中解十六諦十六諦總問：	In the treatise, the sixteen truths are explained. The general question is:
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b18_18']	為物有十六、為名有十六耶？	為物有十六、為名有十六耶？	Are there sixteen things or sixteen names?
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b18_20']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b20_11']	毘防夷反頗判何反沙翻為廣解師解，為物有十六，故立十六名，實有其體故稱物。	毘防夷反頗判何反沙翻為廣解師解，為物有十六，故立十六名，實有其體故稱物。	The master who explains the meaning of Vipaśyandin's extensive explanation says there are sixteen things, so he establishes the sixteen names. Since the substance actually exists, it is called a thing.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b21_20']	經優波提舍翻為離欲修善說師解，名有十六，物唯有七，苦諦有四。	經優波提舍翻為離欲修善說師解，名有十六，物唯有七，苦諦有四。	The master who explains the meaning of the Sūtra on the Practice of Renunciation says there are sixteen names, but there are only seven things. The truth of suffering has four aspects,
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b22_23']	謂無常、苦、空、無我，集、滅、道三諦各一，合為七。	謂無常、苦、空、無我，集、滅、道三諦各一，合為七。	namely impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self. The truths of origination, cessation, and the path each have one aspect, totaling seven.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b25_15']	佛本說優波提舍經以解諸義，佛滅後阿難、迦旃延等還誦出先時所聞以解經中義，如諸弟子造論解經，故名為經優波提舍。	佛本說優波提舍經以解諸義，佛滅後阿難、迦旃延等還誦出先時所聞以解經中義，如諸弟子造論解經，故名為經優波提舍。	The Buddha originally taught the Sūtra on the Practice of Renunciation to explain various meanings. After the Buddha's passing, Ānanda, Kātyāyanīputra, and others recited what they had previously heard to explain the meanings in the sūtras, just as the disciples composed treatises to explain the sūtras. Therefore, it is called the Sūtra on the Practice of Renunciation.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b26_14']	毘婆沙復從優波提舍中出，略優波提舍；	毘婆沙復從優波提舍中出，略優波提舍；	The Vibhāṣā was also extracted from the Upadeśa, and the Abridged Upadeśa;
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b27_8']	既是傳出故，不言經毘婆沙。	既是傳出故，不言經毘婆沙。	Since it is a transmission, it does not say Vibhāṣā of the sūtras.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b27_14']	今先依前釋。	今先依前釋。	Now, first relying on the previous explanation.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b28_17']	屬緣故稱無常，有為法無力，不能自起，藉緣方起。	屬緣故稱無常，有為法無力，不能自起，藉緣方起。	Because it belongs to conditions, it is called impermanent. Conditioned dharmas have no power to arise by themselves, they arise only by relying on conditions.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158b29_15']	如嬰孩小兒不能自起，藉他扶持方復得起。	如嬰孩小兒不能自起，藉他扶持方復得起。	Like a young child who cannot stand up by itself, it can only stand up by relying on others to support it.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c01_8']	所言緣者，即是貪愛及業。	所言緣者，即是貪愛及業。	What are called conditions are precisely craving and karma.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c02_1']	必須具此二法，五陰方得生。	必須具此二法，五陰方得生。	These two dharmas must be complete before the five aggregates can be born.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c03_7']	業能生果，雖復能生，若無貪愛愛著、應生處者，果亦不起。	業能生果，雖復能生，若無貪愛愛著、應生處者，果亦不起。	Karma can produce results. Although it can produce, if there is no craving and attachment to the place where it should be born, the result will also not arise.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c04_16']	由如地水等能生穀牙，若無人功以穀子安置地中，牙終不得生。	由如地水等能生穀牙，若無人功以穀子安置地中，牙終不得生。	It is like the earth, water, etc. can produce grain sprouts. If no one works to place the grain seeds in the ground, the sprouts will never grow.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c05_11']	未起貪愛及業時，果則是無起。	未起貪愛及業時，果則是無起。	Before craving and karma arise, the result is non-existent.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c06_11']	貪愛及業因緣和合，果方得生，生則是有。	貪愛及業因緣和合，果方得生，生則是有。	When the causes and conditions of craving, love, and karma come together, the effect is then produced, and there is existence.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c07_4']	業力若盡，果則謝滅，還復成無。	業力若盡，果則謝滅，還復成無。	If the power of karma is exhausted, the effect will cease and return to non-existence.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c07_19']	即是先後，先後無繫，屬於緣故。	即是先後，先後無繫，屬於緣故。	This is simply before and after, with no connection between before and after, because it belongs to conditions.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c08_6']	言屬緣故名無常。	言屬緣故名無常。	It is said to belong to conditions and is therefore called impermanent.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c08_13']	逼惱性故名苦。	逼惱性故名苦。	Because it has the nature of oppression, it is called suffering.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c09_11']	逼惱有兩種，一違逆逼惱、二隨順逼惱。	逼惱有兩種，一違逆逼惱、二隨順逼惱。	There are two kinds of oppression: oppression that goes against and oppression that goes along.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c10_3']	若於佛弟子，是違逆逼惱。	若於佛弟子，是違逆逼惱。	If it is oppression that goes against, it is towards the Buddha's disciples.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c11_1']	佛弟子於生死中恒生怖畏，經中譬云：	佛弟子於生死中恒生怖畏，經中譬云：	The Buddha's disciples always give rise to fear in the midst of birth and death. A sutra compares it to:
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c12_12']	譬如燒利劍，火光耀眼，人執之在側，欲以相害，於念念中恒生大怖畏。	譬如燒利劍，火光耀眼，人執之在側，欲以相害，於念念中恒生大怖畏。	It is like a sharp sword on fire, with flames dazzling the eyes. If someone holds it to the side, wanting to use it to harm, in every thought there will always be great fear.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c13_4']	佛弟子怖畏生死亦如此。	佛弟子怖畏生死亦如此。	The Buddha's disciples' fear of birth and death is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c13_11']	此下是違逆義。	此下是違逆義。	This is the meaning of going against below.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c14_5']	而生老病死等，恒相逼惱故苦。	而生老病死等，恒相逼惱故苦。	But birth, old age, sickness, death, and so forth, always oppress and therefore it is suffering.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c14_15']	若於凡夫是隨順逼惱。	若於凡夫是隨順逼惱。	If it is oppression that goes along, it is towards ordinary people.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c15_9']	凡夫愛著生死，即是隨順義。	凡夫愛著生死，即是隨順義。	Ordinary beings' attachment to birth and death is the meaning of following.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c16_15']	如兄弟二人，兄甚愛弟、弟恒惱兄，兄雖受惱猶自愛之。	如兄弟二人，兄甚愛弟、弟恒惱兄，兄雖受惱猶自愛之。	It is like two brothers, the elder brother loves the younger brother very much, but the younger brother always annoys the elder brother. Although the elder brother suffers from the annoyance, he still loves the younger brother.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c17_19']	凡夫愛著生死，雖復受苦猶愛著之，故以逼惱性為苦。	凡夫愛著生死，雖復受苦猶愛著之，故以逼惱性為苦。	Ordinary beings' attachment to birth and death, although they suffer, they still love and cling to it, therefore, it is called suffering because of its nature of oppression.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c18_8']	對治我所見故名空。	對治我所見故名空。	In order to counteract the view of mine, it is called emptiness.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c19_18']	凡夫執一切法言是我所，今明一切悉非我所，為對治此見故名為空。	凡夫執一切法言是我所，今明一切悉非我所，為對治此見故名為空。	Ordinary beings grasp at all dharmas and say they are mine. Now, it is clarified that all are not mine. In order to counteract this view, it is called emptiness.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c20_8']	對治我見故名無我。	對治我見故名無我。	In order to counteract the view of self, it is called no-self.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c22_6']	凡夫執五陰等以為我，今明一切法悉無有我，為對治此見故說無我此四是苦諦。	凡夫執五陰等以為我，今明一切法悉無有我，為對治此見故說無我此四是苦諦。	Ordinary beings grasp at the five skandhas and so forth as the self. Now, it is clarified that all dharmas are without self. In order to counteract this view, no-self is taught. These four are the truth of suffering.

['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c23_4']	種子法道理，故名因能生果。	種子法道理，故名因能生果。	Because of the principle of the dharma of seeds, it is called cause, which can give rise to effects.

['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c25_10']	四義者，一、種子破則不能生，如取種子磨之令破，雖具諸緣，不復能生牙。	四義者，一、種子破則不能生，如取種子磨之令破，雖具諸緣，不復能生牙。	The four meanings are: First, if the seeds are destroyed, they cannot produce. It is like taking seeds and grinding them to destroy them. Even with all the conditions, they can no longer produce sprouts.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c27_1']	貪愛等煩惱亦是生果之種子，若為道所破，雖具餘緣，不復能生果。	貪愛等煩惱亦是生果之種子，若為道所破，雖具餘緣，不復能生果。	Craving and other afflictions are also the seeds that produce results. If they are destroyed by the path, even with the remaining conditions, they can no longer produce results.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0158c28_5']	二、陳宿故雖具諸緣亦不能生牙，以種子經時節久故。	二、陳宿故雖具諸緣亦不能生牙，以種子經時節久故。	Second, even though the conditions are complete, the seeds cannot produce sprouts because the seeds have been stored for a long time.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a01_3']	貪愛等生果亦復如此，聲聞六十大劫修行、獨覺百大劫修行、佛三阿僧祇劫修行。	貪愛等生果亦復如此，聲聞六十大劫修行、獨覺百大劫修行、佛三阿僧祇劫修行。	The production of results by craving and other afflictions is also like this. Śrāvakas practice for sixty eons, pratyekabuddhas practice for a hundred eons, and buddhas practice for three incalculable eons.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a05_1']	三乘人在未發心之前，於一闡提位中起貪愛等煩惱，煩惱生業，業所感果猶未受之，從修行已去多歷時節，功德智慧既轉深廣，映蔽先因力用衰弱，雖具餘緣不能生果。	三乘人在未發心之前，於一闡提位中起貪愛等煩惱，煩惱生業，業所感果猶未受之，從修行已去多歷時節，功德智慧既轉深廣，映蔽先因力用衰弱，雖具餘緣不能生果。	The three vehicles of beings, before they have aroused the mind [of enlightenment], in the state of icchantika, give rise to afflictions such as craving, and the karma produced by afflictions has not yet received the fruits it will bring. From the time of practice onward, they pass through many periods of time, and merit and wisdom become increasingly profound and vast, overshadowing the power and efficacy of past causes. Even with other conditions present, they cannot produce fruits.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a05_8']	《大有經》說：	《大有經》說：	The Mahāvastu says:
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a06_4']	九十八惑生一煩惱，一煩惱生九十八惑。	九十八惑生一煩惱，一煩惱生九十八惑。	Ninety-eight delusions give rise to one affliction, and one affliction gives rise to ninety-eight delusions.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a06_19']	如因貪具生九十八惑，皆能生貪。	如因貪具生九十八惑，皆能生貪。	For example, craving gives rise to ninety-eight delusions, and all of them can give rise to craving.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a08_4']	三、失時故雖具餘緣則不生牙，如春種則生、冬則不生。	三、失時故雖具餘緣則不生牙，如春種則生、冬則不生。	Third, even with other conditions present, it does not produce sprouts, just as planting in spring will produce but planting in winter will not.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a09_15']	因失時亦不能生果，如鴦掘魔羅因無明斷二千命，死必應入地獄；	因失時亦不能生果，如鴦掘魔羅因無明斷二千命，死必應入地獄；	Causes that have lost their time also cannot produce fruits, just as Aṅgulimāla, due to ignorance, took two thousand lives, and upon death would certainly have entered hell;
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a11_5']	而現身得成阿羅漢，先所作惡以時差故，雖具餘緣不復得生果。	而現身得成阿羅漢，先所作惡以時差故，雖具餘緣不復得生果。	Yet they manifest the attainment of arhatship in this body. Because the previously committed evil has been eliminated, even with the presence of other conditions, it will not produce any further fruits.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a12_6']	四、因緣不具，雖不破、不陳宿、不失時亦不生牙。	四、因緣不具，雖不破、不陳宿、不失時亦不生牙。	Fourth, even if the conditions are not destroyed, not old, and not lost, the seed will still not sprout if the conditions are incomplete.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a13_4']	如地水人功等因緣不具，故不能生牙。	如地水人功等因緣不具，故不能生牙。	Just as the conditions such as earth, water, and human effort are incomplete, so the seed cannot sprout.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a14_15']	因生果亦爾，雖未被破、未經久時及失時，而因緣不具，則不能生果。	因生果亦爾，雖未被破、未經久時及失時，而因緣不具，則不能生果。	The arising of the effect from the cause is also like this. Even if it has not been destroyed, has not passed a long time, and has not been lost, if the conditions are incomplete, it will not be able to produce the effect.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a15_10']	若眾生作業能牽生果，須具三事：	若眾生作業能牽生果，須具三事：	If sentient beings create karma that can lead to the arising of effects, three things must be present:
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a16_10']	一親近善知識、二有信向心、三作功力惡業。	一親近善知識、二有信向心、三作功力惡業。	First, being close to good spiritual friends; second, having a mind of faith and understanding; third, making effort in evil deeds.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a17_21']	須三事對此求之，若無三事，因緣不具則不能得果，故《醜陋經》云：	須三事對此求之，若無三事，因緣不具則不能得果，故《醜陋經》云：	These three things must be sought against this. If the three things are absent, the conditions are incomplete, and the effect cannot be obtained. Therefore, the Ugly Sutra says:
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a19_6']	若眾生願生人中，而作業因緣不具故，乃於畜生等中受果。	若眾生願生人中，而作業因緣不具故，乃於畜生等中受果。	If sentient beings wish to be reborn among humans, but the conditions for creating karma are incomplete, they will then experience the effects among animals and other realms.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a20_13']	若作惡業，應於畜生等中受生，因緣不具，乃於人中受果。	若作惡業，應於畜生等中受生，因緣不具，乃於人中受果。	If one commits evil karma, one should be reborn in the animal realm, but due to incomplete conditions, one experiences the results in the human realm.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a22_4']	如阿羅漢，雖具有諸業，以斷煩惱盡業，無煩惱為伴故，則不能牽生。	如阿羅漢，雖具有諸業，以斷煩惱盡業，無煩惱為伴故，則不能牽生。	It is like an arhat who, although possessing various karmas, has eliminated all afflictions and has no karma accompanied by afflictions, so it cannot lead to rebirth.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a23_17']	又如中滅阿那含，用業已盡，而貪愛未盡，不得受色界生，生在中陰中。	又如中滅阿那含，用業已盡，而貪愛未盡，不得受色界生，生在中陰中。	It is also like a non-returner who attains cessation, whose karma is exhausted but whose craving is not yet exhausted, so they cannot be reborn in the form realm and are reborn in the intermediate state.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a26_3']	又如得初果，竟起修道所滅煩惱，煩惱生業，雖具業煩惱，由斷見道所破煩惱故，不復得用新業受生。	又如得初果，竟起修道所滅煩惱，煩惱生業，雖具業煩惱，由斷見道所破煩惱故，不復得用新業受生。	It is also like one who attains the first fruit, who then gives rise to afflictions to be eliminated by the path of cultivation. Although they possess karma and afflictions born from afflictions, because they have eliminated the afflictions to be eliminated by the path of seeing, they no longer use new karma to take rebirth.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a27_2']	世間種子法，必須具四種道理，方得生牙。	世間種子法，必須具四種道理，方得生牙。	The principle of seeds in the world must have four aspects in order for a sprout to grow.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a28_12']	貪愛及業為種子法亦爾，必須具四種道理方能生果，生果故名因。	貪愛及業為種子法亦爾，必須具四種道理方能生果，生果故名因。	The principle of seeds of craving and karma is also like this. It must have four aspects in order to be able to produce results. Producing results is called cause.

['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a29_7']	答：	答：	The answer is:
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159a29_12']	煩惱為正。	煩惱為正。	Afflictions are the correct [seed].
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b01_10']	煩惱生業，業不能生煩惱，煩惱是本故。	煩惱生業，業不能生煩惱，煩惱是本故。	Afflictions give rise to karma, but karma cannot give rise to afflictions, because afflictions are the root.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b02_3']	又有業無煩惱，必不能牽生；	又有業無煩惱，必不能牽生；	Moreover, there is karma without afflictions, which definitely cannot lead to rebirth;
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b02_15']	有煩惱無業，由得中陰生。	有煩惱無業，由得中陰生。	there are afflictions without karma, which can lead to rebirth in the intermediate state.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b03_7']	二顯現故名集起。	二顯現故名集起。	Second, it is called accumulation because it manifests.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b04_19']	顯現有兩義，一、貪愛與業相應令果得生，未生時果未現，生時則顯現。	顯現有兩義，一、貪愛與業相應令果得生，未生時果未現，生時則顯現。	There are two meanings of manifestation: First, craving and karma correspond to each other, causing the fruit to be born. Before it is born, the fruit is not yet manifest; when it is born, it is manifested.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b06_15']	二、貪愛能顯於境界，境界實是鄙惡，而貪愛轉心謂境界為好，即顯現境界令好。	二、貪愛能顯於境界，境界實是鄙惡，而貪愛轉心謂境界為好，即顯現境界令好。	Second, craving can manifest the object. The object is actually contemptible, but craving turns the mind and considers the object to be good, thus manifesting the object as good.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b09_1']	如一女人，三識往觀之，凡夫見之謂為可愛之境，虎狼觀之謂是可食之物，聖人觀之謂為骨藏。	如一女人，三識往觀之，凡夫見之謂為可愛之境，虎狼觀之謂是可食之物，聖人觀之謂為骨藏。	For example, a single woman is observed by three kinds of consciousness. An ordinary person sees her and considers her to be a desirable object; a tiger or wolf sees her and considers her to be food; a sage sees her and considers her to be a skeleton.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b09_13']	謂為骨藏，此是稱境而知。	謂為骨藏，此是稱境而知。	It is called a bone-store, this is knowing in accordance with the object.

['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b11_16']	由貪愛顯現，應生處境，於中起染著故，業得生果；	由貪愛顯現，應生處境，於中起染著故，業得生果；	Because the object that appears due to craving and love is the place where one should be born, one gives rise to attachment in it, and thus karma can produce results;
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b12_10']	若無此二顯現，果則不得生。	若無此二顯現，果則不得生。	If these two appearances do not exist, the result cannot be produced.
['ZH_T32_1641_001:0159b13_4']	明此兩種顯現，為釋集起義。	明此兩種顯現，為釋集起義。	This clarification of the two kinds of appearances is to explain the meaning of accumulation.
