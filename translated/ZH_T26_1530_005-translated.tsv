['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312a12_8']	如是如來大圓鏡智，不斷無量眾行善瑩，為諸智影遍起依緣，謂聲聞乘諸智影像，獨一覺乘諸智影像，無上大乘諸智影像，為欲令諸聲聞乘人依聲聞乘而出離故，獨一覺人依獨覺乘而出離故，大乘之人依無上乘而出離故。	如是如來大圓鏡智，不斷無量眾行善瑩，為諸智影遍起依緣，謂聲聞乘諸智影像，獨一覺乘諸智影像，無上大乘諸智影像，為欲令諸聲聞乘人依聲聞乘而出離故，獨一覺人依獨覺乘而出離故，大乘之人依無上乘而出離故。	In the same way, the Tathāgata's great perfect mirror cognition, uninterrupted and well polished by immeasurable practices, serves as the supporting condition for the arising of all cognition images, namely the images of the cognitions of the Śrāvaka Vehicle, the images of the cognitions of the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, and the images of the cognitions of the unsurpassed Great Vehicle, in order to enable the people of the Śrāvaka Vehicle to depart by relying on the Śrāvaka Vehicle, the people of the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle to depart by relying on the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, and the people of the Great Vehicle to depart by relying on the unsurpassed Vehicle.

['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312a17_6']	如世圓鏡為遍於中現其面等一切影像，種種加行周瑩其面前後兩邊，於一切處普能為緣現一切影。	如世圓鏡為遍於中現其面等一切影像，種種加行周瑩其面前後兩邊，於一切處普能為緣現一切影。	Just as a round mirror in the world universally manifests all images of faces, etc., and through various efforts polishing its front and back and four sides, it is able to universally manifest all images as conditions everywhere,
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312a22_2']	鏡智亦爾，一切如來為菩薩時，雖有種性而為障覆未能現起，為遍於中生起三乘一切智等諸法影故，精勤修習不斷無量眾行善瑩，金剛喻定現在前時，離一切障清淨圓滿，遍能生起三乘智等一切影像。	鏡智亦爾，一切如來為菩薩時，雖有種性而為障覆未能現起，為遍於中生起三乘一切智等諸法影故，精勤修習不斷無量眾行善瑩，金剛喻定現在前時，離一切障清淨圓滿，遍能生起三乘智等一切影像。	mirror wisdom is also like this. Although all tathāgatas have the Buddha-nature while bodhisattvas, it is covered by obstacles and is unable to manifest. In order to universally generate the images of all wisdoms of the three vehicles within it, they diligently cultivate and practice, well polishing it with countless practices. When the vajra-like samādhi is present, it is free from all obstacles, pure and perfect, and is able to universally generate all images such as the wisdoms of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312a23_1']	不斷，就方，無分限故無量，就時，無量時故。	不斷，就方，無分限故無量，就時，無量時故。	Uninterrupted refers to space, because it is limitless. Immeasurable refers to time, because it is for immeasurable time.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312a24_17']	此言因位遍一切處，於無量時勤修眾行，除障善瑩大圓鏡智，能生三乘智等影像。	此言因位遍一切處，於無量時勤修眾行，除障善瑩大圓鏡智，能生三乘智等影像。	This means that in the stage of cause, it diligently cultivates practices everywhere and for immeasurable time, well polishing the great perfect mirror wisdom by removing obstacles, and is able to generate images such as the wisdoms of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312a26_15']	又即鏡智遍處恒時離諸垢穢，種種行德圓滿莊嚴極圓淨故，一切處時能起諸影。	又即鏡智遍處恒時離諸垢穢，種種行德圓滿莊嚴極圓淨故，一切處時能起諸影。	Moreover, mirror knowledge is everywhere and always free from defilements, because it is adorned with the perfection of various practices and virtues and is extremely pure and clear, and it is able to produce all images everywhere and at all times.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312a29_7']	如說殊勝金剛喻定斷一切障，證得如來大圓鏡智，種種功德圓滿莊嚴，於一切處及無量時能起三乘一切影像。	如說殊勝金剛喻定斷一切障，證得如來大圓鏡智，種種功德圓滿莊嚴，於一切處及無量時能起三乘一切影像。	As it is said, the excellent vajra-like samādhi eliminates all obstacles, realizes the great mirror knowledge of the Tathāgata, is adorned with the perfection of various merits, and is able to produce the images of the three vehicles everywhere and at immeasurable times.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b03_16']	此中意說，各別善根成熟差別勝道生時，大圓鏡智或近或遠，隨其所應為作強緣，決定種性各依自乘而得出離，不定種性或依大乘或依餘乘而得出離。	此中意說，各別善根成熟差別勝道生時，大圓鏡智或近或遠，隨其所應為作強緣，決定種性各依自乘而得出離，不定種性或依大乘或依餘乘而得出離。	The meaning here is explained as follows: when the superior path of the maturation of each individual good root is born, mirror knowledge is either near or far, and it acts as a strong condition as appropriate. Those of determined lineage each attain liberation according to their own vehicle, while those of undetermined lineage attain liberation either by relying on the Great Vehicle or on other vehicles.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b04_8']	言出離者，即是涅槃。	言出離者，即是涅槃。	As for attaining liberation, this refers to nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b07_4']	諸三乘人用自種性以為因緣，如來鏡智為增上緣，精勤方便修集資糧引生聖道，除煩惱障及所知障，隨其所應各證涅槃。	諸三乘人用自種性以為因緣，如來鏡智為增上緣，精勤方便修集資糧引生聖道，除煩惱障及所知障，隨其所應各證涅槃。	The three vehicles use their own species as the cause and condition, and the mirror wisdom of the Tathāgata as the dominant condition. Through diligent effort and cultivation of the requisites, they give rise to the holy path, eliminate the obstacle of afflictions and the obstacle to that which is to be known, and each attains nirvāṇa according to their capacity.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b10_1']	決定種性聲聞獨覺住無學位，樂寂滅故發業潤生，諸煩惱障永滅除故，先業煩惱所感身心，任運滅已更不受生，無所依故。	決定種性聲聞獨覺住無學位，樂寂滅故發業潤生，諸煩惱障永滅除故，先業煩惱所感身心，任運滅已更不受生，無所依故。	Those of fixed species, such as śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, abide in the state of no more learning. Because they delight in quiescence and cessation, they give rise to karma and nourish birth, but because the obstacle of afflictions has been eternally eliminated, the body and mind that were impelled by previous karma and afflictions cease spontaneously and they do not receive birth again, because there is no basis for it.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b13_11']	一切有漏無漏有為諸行種子，皆隨斷滅，唯有轉依無戲論相離垢真如清淨法界解脫身在，名無餘依般涅槃界，常住安樂究竟寂滅，不墮眾數不可思議。	一切有漏無漏有為諸行種子，皆隨斷滅，唯有轉依無戲論相離垢真如清淨法界解脫身在，名無餘依般涅槃界，常住安樂究竟寂滅，不墮眾數不可思議。	All the seeds of contaminated and uncontaminated conditioned activities are eliminated along with it. Only the transformed basis, the pure dharma realm of uncontaminated suchness free from defilements, the body of liberation, remains, called the realm of nirvāṇa without remainder, eternally abiding, blissful, ultimately quiescent, not falling into any category, inconceivable.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b15_3']	同諸如來，但無有為無漏功德所莊嚴故，無有更起利益安樂有情事故。	同諸如來，但無有為無漏功德所莊嚴故，無有更起利益安樂有情事故。	They are the same as the tathāgatas, but they are not adorned with conditioned merit and knowledge, and they do not have the activity of benefiting and gladdening sentient beings.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b18_4']	不同如來，不定種性聲聞獨覺住無學位，雖無煩惱樂菩提故，由定願力留身相續修大乘行，乃至獲得金剛喻定，一切障滅證佛三身。	不同如來，不定種性聲聞獨覺住無學位，雖無煩惱樂菩提故，由定願力留身相續修大乘行，乃至獲得金剛喻定，一切障滅證佛三身。	They are not the same as the tathāgatas. Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas of the indeterminate class who abide in the state of no training, although they are without afflictions and delight in bodhi, by the power of their vows they remain in the continuity of their bodies and cultivate the practices of the Great Vehicle, until they attain the diamond-like samādhi and all their obstacles are extinguished, and they realize the three bodies of a buddha.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b19_12']	雖有有為無漏功德，而無有漏身心在故，證無餘依大涅槃界。	雖有有為無漏功德，而無有漏身心在故，證無餘依大涅槃界。	Although they have conditioned merit and knowledge, they do not have conditioned bodies and minds, and therefore they realize the realm of great nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b20_2']	依謂三界有漏身心。	依謂三界有漏身心。	Remainder refers to the bodies and minds of the three realms that are subject to outflows.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b21_9']	若諸菩薩斷二障盡得佛果時，即得說名證無餘依大涅槃界。	若諸菩薩斷二障盡得佛果時，即得說名證無餘依大涅槃界。	When bodhisattvas extinguish the two obstacles and attain the fruit of buddhahood, they are said to realize the realm of great nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b22_13']	是故二乘先入有餘依涅槃界，後入無餘依涅槃界。	是故二乘先入有餘依涅槃界，後入無餘依涅槃界。	Therefore the two vehicles first enter the realm of nirvāṇa with remainder and later enter the realm of nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b24_7']	菩薩初證如來地時，頓證二種大涅槃界，一切有漏身心盡故，名無餘依。	菩薩初證如來地時，頓證二種大涅槃界，一切有漏身心盡故，名無餘依。	When a bodhisattva first realizes the stage of a tathāgata, he suddenly realizes the two kinds of great nirvāṇa realm. Because all contaminated body and mind are exhausted, it is called “without remainder.”
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b25_6']	猶有變化似有漏相身心在故，名有餘依。	猶有變化似有漏相身心在故，名有餘依。	Because there still remains transformation that resembles contaminated body and mind, it is called “with remainder.”
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b26_5']	悲智無斷所證得故，亦名無住大涅槃界。	悲智無斷所證得故，亦名無住大涅槃界。	Because it is realized through the uninterrupted compassion and wisdom, it is also called the realm of the great nirvāṇa that is not a dwelling place.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b27_17']	涅槃即是真如體上障永滅義，由無漏慧簡擇諦理，斷諸雜染而證得故。	涅槃即是真如體上障永滅義，由無漏慧簡擇諦理，斷諸雜染而證得故。	Nirvāṇa is the meaning of the eternal extinction of obstacles on the essence of suchness. It is realized through the elimination of all defilements by means of the discernment of truth by pure wisdom.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312b29_2']	亦名擇滅，如是擇滅於真如上假施設有，無別實物。	亦名擇滅，如是擇滅於真如上假施設有，無別實物。	It is also called “cessation resulting from discrimination.” Such cessation is provisionally established as existing on the basis of suchness. It is not a separate real entity.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c01_16']	至究竟位說名涅槃，無所趣故，無臭穢故，離編織故，離稠林故，名為涅槃。	至究竟位說名涅槃，無所趣故，無臭穢故，離編織故，離稠林故，名為涅槃。	When it reaches the ultimate stage, it is called nirvāṇa, because it does not go anywhere, because it is without foul odors, because it is free from weaving, and because it is free from the jungle.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c02_18']	聲聞獨覺有所知障習氣未滅，云何證得究竟涅槃？	聲聞獨覺有所知障習氣未滅，云何證得究竟涅槃？	Why is it that śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, who have not yet eliminated the perfuming of the obstacle to that which is to be known, realize the ultimate nirvāṇa?
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c04_13']	所知障習是無知故，非染污故，障菩提果不障涅槃，非煩惱故，不能潤生。	所知障習是無知故，非染污故，障菩提果不障涅槃，非煩惱故，不能潤生。	The habitual propensities of the obstacle to that which is to be known are ignorance and therefore are not defiled. They obstruct the fruit of bodhi and do not obstruct nirvāṇa, because they are not passions and therefore cannot moisten and produce samsaric existence.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c05_16']	若無願力迴心趣大至無學位，盡其壽量必永寂滅。	若無願力迴心趣大至無學位，盡其壽量必永寂滅。	If one does not have the power of vows and turns toward the Great Vehicle, then when one reaches the state of no training, one will certainly eternally enter cessation at the end of one’s life.

['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c07_14']	如圓鏡中大影可得，所謂大地大山大樹大宮舍影，而是圓鏡不等彼量。	如圓鏡中大影可得，所謂大地大山大樹大宮舍影，而是圓鏡不等彼量。	“It is like a great image that can be found in a perfect mirror, that is, the images of the great earth, great mountains, great trees, and great houses, and yet the perfect mirror is not of the same size as they are.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c10_2']	如是如來圓鏡智上，從極喜地乃至佛地智影可得，及與一切世出世法智影可得，而圓鏡智非彼分量。	如是如來圓鏡智上，從極喜地乃至佛地智影可得，及與一切世出世法智影可得，而圓鏡智非彼分量。	In the same way, the images of the knowledge of the tathāgata’s perfect mirror cognition can be found in the knowledge from the stage of joy up to the stage of Buddhahood, and the images of the knowledge of all mundane and supramundane dharmas can be found therein, and yet the perfect mirror cognition is not of the same size as they are.”
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c11_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The Treatise says:
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c12_1']	若圓鏡智能起智影，應同彼量差別可得。	若圓鏡智能起智影，應同彼量差別可得。	If the perfect mirror cognition can produce the images of knowledge, then it must be the case that it is of the same size as they are and can be found.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c13_1']	釋此難言，如圓鏡中大影可得，謂大地等。	釋此難言，如圓鏡中大影可得，謂大地等。	In order to explain this difficulty, the text says that it is like a great image that can be found in a perfect mirror, that is, the images of the great earth, etc.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c16_5']	如世圓鏡，雖能為緣起地等影，而是圓鏡不等彼量，一小鏡中眾多山等大影可得，一大鏡中眾多石等小影可得，雖有形礙而不同影大小數量。	如世圓鏡，雖能為緣起地等影，而是圓鏡不等彼量，一小鏡中眾多山等大影可得，一大鏡中眾多石等小影可得，雖有形礙而不同影大小數量。	Although the worldly perfect mirror serves as a condition for the arising of images of earth, etc., the perfect mirror is not equal to them in size, for many large images of mountains, etc., can appear in a small mirror, and many small images of stones, etc., can appear in a large mirror. Although there is a difference in size, the images are not different from the mirror in size.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c20_5']	鏡智亦爾，雖起諸地世出世間諸智影像無形礙故，而不同彼一切智影大小數量，由是因緣諸佛鏡智名大智藏，世出世間智根本故，如說世尊成大智藏鏡智，能生一切智故。	鏡智亦爾，雖起諸地世出世間諸智影像無形礙故，而不同彼一切智影大小數量，由是因緣諸佛鏡智名大智藏，世出世間智根本故，如說世尊成大智藏鏡智，能生一切智故。	Mirror wisdom is also like this. Although it gives rise to images of the wisdoms of the various stages, mundane and supramundane, because they are formless, it is not the same as those images in size. For this reason, the mirror wisdom of buddhas is called the great treasury of wisdom, because it is the root of the wisdoms of the world and of those who transcend the world. As it is said, the World-honored Buddha is the great treasury of wisdom, because mirror wisdom can give rise to all wisdoms.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c23_9']	應知此中以智名說一切功德，由是鏡智相應淨識具足一切自利利他功德種子，能為因緣生自身中智等影像，為增上緣生他身中智等影像。	應知此中以智名說一切功德，由是鏡智相應淨識具足一切自利利他功德種子，能為因緣生自身中智等影像，為增上緣生他身中智等影像。	You should understand that in this treatise the term wisdom is used to refer to all merits, because the pure consciousness associated with mirror wisdom is endowed with the seeds of all merits that benefit oneself and others. It can serve as the condition as cause for the arising of images of wisdom, etc., in one’s own body and as the dominant condition for the arising of images of wisdom, etc., in the bodies of others.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0312c26_10']	由此鏡智能變現身生智說法，展轉生他智等影故，或悲願力熏修所成，任運為他智等善法增上緣故，令他身中智等善法易得生長。	由此鏡智能變現身生智說法，展轉生他智等影故，或悲願力熏修所成，任運為他智等善法增上緣故，令他身中智等善法易得生長。	Therefore, this mirror cognition is able to transform and manifest bodies, generate cognition, and expound the Dharma, because it successively generates the reflections of other cognitions, etc., or because by the power of compassion and vows, it is cultivated and accomplished, and spontaneously serves as the dominant condition for the good dharmas such as cognition, etc., for others, causing the good dharmas such as cognition, etc., in the bodies of others to be easily obtained and grow.

['ZH_T26_1530_005:0313a02_9']	如是如來大圓鏡智，非惡友攝聞不正法障礙眾生智影起緣，彼非器故。	如是如來大圓鏡智，非惡友攝聞不正法障礙眾生智影起緣，彼非器故。	In the same way, the Tathāgata's great perfect mirror cognition is not the condition for the arising of reflections of cognition in sentient beings who are influenced by bad friends, listen to incorrect teachings, or are obstructed, because they are not suitable vessels.

['ZH_T26_1530_005:0313a06_16']	能生因緣常和合故，諸外道等應無顛倒。	能生因緣常和合故，諸外道等應無顛倒。	Because the causes and conditions that give rise to them are always present, non-Buddhists should be without error.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0313a09_4']	釋此難言，又如圓鏡非處障質影像緣等，如世圓鏡雖能為緣現諸影像，而非處在壁障等質影像起緣。	釋此難言，又如圓鏡非處障質影像緣等，如世圓鏡雖能為緣現諸影像，而非處在壁障等質影像起緣。	To explain this difficulty, it is said, Again, it is like a perfect mirror, which is not the condition for the images of objects that are in the wrong place or obstructed. Just as a perfect mirror in the world, although able to serve as the condition for the manifestation of various images, is not the condition for the arising of images of objects that are in the wrong place, such as on a wall or obstruction,

Although it is able to serve as the condition for the arising of the images of knowledges, it is not the condition for the arising of the images of knowledges of those who are under the influence of bad friends, who delight in listening to false teachings, and who are obstructed. This is because they are not vessels that can be empowered and are not vessels for hearing the true Dharma.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0313a13_13']	是故外道，聖道不生常懷顛倒，善法種子被損伏故，惡法種子遇生緣故。	是故外道，聖道不生常懷顛倒，善法種子被損伏故，惡法種子遇生緣故。	Therefore, for non-Buddhists, the noble path does not arise, and they always harbor inversions, because the seeds of wholesome dharmas are damaged and suppressed, and because the seeds of unwholesome dharmas encounter conditions for arising.
['ZH_T26_1530_005:0313a16_1']	一切眾生無始時來，習善時少造惡時多，是故善法雖遇強緣亦難生長，惡法雖遇少小外緣則便熾盛。	一切眾生無始時來，習善時少造惡時多，是故善法雖遇強緣亦難生長，惡法雖遇少小外緣則便熾盛。	From beginningless time, all sentient beings have cultivated wholesome dharmas for a short time and created unwholesome dharmas for a long time. Therefore, even if wholesome dharmas encounter strong conditions, they are still difficult to give rise to and grow, while unwholesome dharmas, even if they encounter few external conditions, will then flourish.
