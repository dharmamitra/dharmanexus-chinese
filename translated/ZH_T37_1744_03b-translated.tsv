['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075a18_5']	上來未對昔依明今一依，是故對昔依非究竟辨今依究竟。	上來未對昔依明今一依，是故對昔依非究竟辨今依究竟。	03b	The one reliance above has not yet been clarified in comparison with the past reliance, so it is contrasted with the past reliance that is not ultimate to discern the present reliance that is ultimate.
['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075a20_7']	〈一諦章〉以對今三非究竟明今一滅究竟，是故一依不更對今三依非究竟、一依是究竟。	〈一諦章〉以對今三非究竟明今一滅究竟，是故一依不更對今三依非究竟、一依是究竟。	03b	The chapter on one truth clarifies the present one extinction that is ultimate by contrasting it with the present three that are not ultimate, so the one reliance does not need to be contrasted with the present three reliances that are not ultimate, and the one reliance that is ultimate.
['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075a20_17']	就此一章以二門釋之：	就此一章以二門釋之：	03b	This chapter is explained through two approaches:

['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075a26_17']	又欲明佛教大宗舒卷之，佛法廣說則八萬四千，攝八萬四千在於八諦，次攝八諦唯成一四諦，雖有四諦終歸一諦，唯此一諦是其真實。	又欲明佛教大宗舒卷之，佛法廣說則八萬四千，攝八萬四千在於八諦，次攝八諦唯成一四諦，雖有四諦終歸一諦，唯此一諦是其真實。	03b	Moreover, it clarifies the unfolding and folding of the great purport of the Buddhist teachings. The extensive explanation of the Buddha's teachings is 84,000, which subsumes the 84,000 into the eight truths, which next subsumes the eight truths to form only one four noble truths. Although there are four noble truths, they ultimately return to the one truth, which is the only true truth.

['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075a29_1']	故《法華》云「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。	故《法華》云「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。	03b	Thus the Lotus Sutra says, This Dharma cannot be shown, the characteristics of words are extinguished.

['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075b11_11']	一相各異故、二因緣生故、三本無今有故、四已有還無故。	一相各異故、二因緣生故、三本無今有故、四已有還無故。	03b	First, their characteristics are different from each other; second, they arise from causes and conditions; third, they did not exist before but exist now; fourth, they existed but will not exist again.
['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075b12_2']	滅諦翻此四，故名為常。	滅諦翻此四，故名為常。	03b	The truth of cessation is the opposite of these four, so it is called permanent.

['ZH_T37_1744_03b:0075b16_11']	若是四諦中道常，此是因道，故名無常；	若是四諦中道常，此是因道，故名無常；	03b	If it is the permanent path within the four truths, it is called impermanent because it is the path of causes;
