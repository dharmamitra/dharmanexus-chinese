It sprinkles the water of samādhi on the three thousand worlds and perfumes the fragrance of precepts on the hundred koṭīs. It proclaims the vast emptiness, abandoning biased attachments to the two extremes, and extensively expounds the principle and phenomena, awakening to the true canon in the one reality.

['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a18_19']	一切境想總有二類。	一切境想總有二類。	In general, there are two types of realms and thoughts.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a19_6']	一者、輕重相對。	一者、輕重相對。	First, comparing the light and heavy.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a20_8']	如殺五句，上三對人是重犯境，隨心差別遂成夷蘭；	如殺五句，上三對人是重犯境，隨心差別遂成夷蘭；	For example, the five statements in the precept against killing, the first three are heavy offenses against people, and according to the differences in the mind, they become pārājika or thullaccaya offenses;
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a21_7']	下二非人是輕犯境，亦隨心別故成蘭罪。	下二非人是輕犯境，亦隨心別故成蘭罪。	The last two are light offenses against non-humans, and because they also differ according to the mind, they become thullaccaya offenses.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a21_16']	即是約境重輕相對。	即是約境重輕相對。	This is based on the relative heaviness and lightness of the object.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a22_5']	二者、犯不犯相對。	二者、犯不犯相對。	Second, it is based on the contrast between violation and non-violation.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a23_4']	如盜戒中有主即犯，無主不犯，兩相對也。	如盜戒中有主即犯，無主不犯，兩相對也。	For example, in the precept against stealing, if there is an owner, it is a violation; if there is no owner, it is not a violation. This is a contrast between the two.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a24_8']	就此二類辨句多少者，若據盡理，二類悉應具足五句。	就此二類辨句多少者，若據盡理，二類悉應具足五句。	In terms of distinguishing the number of phrases based on these two categories, if we follow the complete principle, both categories should have all five phrases.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a24_18', 'ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a25_12']	今據別理，故有多少。🔽謂若殺戒無第三者，恐漏有犯。	今據別理，故有多少。 謂若殺戒無第三者，恐漏有犯。	But now we follow a separate principle, so there are more and less.🔽This means that if the precept against killing does not have a third phrase, it may leak and include violations.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a26_8']	若其盜戒有第三者，濫治無犯也。	若其盜戒有第三者，濫治無犯也。	If the precept against stealing has a third phrase, it may indiscriminately punish non-violations.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a27_12']	且如殺戒恐漏有犯者，以第三句人非人想，有其兩義：	且如殺戒恐漏有犯者，以第三句人非人想，有其兩義：	To take the precept against killing as an example of possibly leaking violations, the third phrase mistaking a non-human for a human has two meanings:
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a27_20']	一者、方便殺人。	一者、方便殺人。	First, killing a human being with the intention to kill a human.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470a28_17']	本起人相，臨殺之時方乃轉為非人想殺。	本起人相，臨殺之時方乃轉為非人想殺。	When about to kill, one changes their mind to killing a non-human.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b01_11']	其未轉前人邊蘭罪，便是殺人戒宗所收，得因蘭罪，故文即結偷蘭遮罪。	其未轉前人邊蘭罪，便是殺人戒宗所收，得因蘭罪，故文即結偷蘭遮罪。	Before the change, the human-side offense of thullaccaya is included in the main body of the precept against killing, and one obtains the thullaccaya offense based on that. Therefore, the text immediately concludes with the thullaccaya offense.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b03_2']	轉想之後作非人想，非人之上應得吉羅，非殺人宗，故隱不說。	轉想之後作非人想，非人之上應得吉羅，非殺人宗，故隱不說。	After changing the thought, if one has the thought of a non-human, one should obtain a duṣkṛta offense for a non-human. Because it is not the main offense of killing a human, it is concealed and not mentioned.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b04_3']	二者、欲殺非人，被人來替，緣於人境作非人想。	二者、欲殺非人，被人來替，緣於人境作非人想。	Second, if one wishes to kill a non-human, and a human comes to replace it, taking the human object as a non-human thought.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b05_11']	此雖亦名人非人想，乃是非人被人境差，唯非人上得因吉羅。	此雖亦名人非人想，乃是非人被人境差，唯非人上得因吉羅。	Although this is also a human non-human thought, it is a non-human replaced by a human object. One only obtains a duṣkṛta offense for the non-human.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b06_10']	此罪唯是殺非人宗，望殺人宗全無此句。	此罪唯是殺非人宗，望殺人宗全無此句。	This offense is only the main offense of killing a non-human. It is completely unrelated to the main offense of killing a human.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b08_7']	今兩義中，若從後義闕第三者，即漏前義殺人宗罪，故從前義立第三句不漏其罪。	今兩義中，若從後義闕第三者，即漏前義殺人宗罪，故從前義立第三句不漏其罪。	Now, if one follows the latter meaning and omits the third, then it leaks the former meaning of the offense of killing a human. Therefore, following the former meaning, the third statement is established without leaking the offense.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b10_2']	次明盜戒恐治無犯故闕第三者，謂若第三云有主作無主想者，亦有兩義：	次明盜戒恐治無犯故闕第三者，謂若第三云有主作無主想者，亦有兩義：	Next, it is explained that the precept against stealing omits the third because it is feared that there will be no offense. It is said that if the third states having the thought of no owner for that which has an owner, there are also two meanings:
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b11_14']	一者、本擬盜有主物，先時進趣作有主想，臨離處時方乃轉為無主物想。	一者、本擬盜有主物，先時進趣作有主想，臨離處時方乃轉為無主物想。	First, originally intending to steal another's property, previously advancing with the thought of another's property, but at the time of leaving the place one changes to the thought of property without an owner.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b12_18']	其未轉前主邊蘭罪，即是盜宗，轉想之後即全無罪。	其未轉前主邊蘭罪，即是盜宗，轉想之後即全無罪。	Before the change, the offense of duṣkṛta is on the side of the owner, which is the basis of the offense of stealing. After the change of thought, there is no offense at all.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b15_12']	二者、本來發意欲取無主之物，乃被主物來替其處，緣此以作無主物想，此雖亦名有主作無主想，此義唯是不犯宗收。	二者、本來發意欲取無主之物，乃被主物來替其處，緣此以作無主物想，此雖亦名有主作無主想，此義唯是不犯宗收。	Second, originally intending to take property without an owner, but it is replaced by the property of another, and based on this one has the thought of property without an owner. Although this is also called having the thought of property without an owner regarding another's property, this meaning is only included in the basis of non-offense.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b17_1']	今兩義中，若從前義立第三者，即恐濫治後義不犯，故不立也。	今兩義中，若從前義立第三者，即恐濫治後義不犯，故不立也。	Now, if from the former meaning one establishes the third, then one is afraid of confusing the latter meaning of non-offense, and therefore it is not established.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b18_13']	若據盡理，應從前義立第三句，如房戒中處分作不處分想者，是盡理也。	若據盡理，應從前義立第三句，如房戒中處分作不處分想者，是盡理也。	If according to the complete principle, one should establish the third statement according to the former meaning, such as in the precept on dwellings, thinking of a designated place as an undesignated place, this is the complete principle.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b19_7']	故盡理說，二類諸戒悉應具五。	故盡理說，二類諸戒悉應具五。	Therefore, speaking from the complete principle, the two types of precepts should all have five parts.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b21_1']	然此二類，如殺戒中人與非人重輕相對，亦得更就有情無情犯不犯對。	然此二類，如殺戒中人與非人重輕相對，亦得更就有情無情犯不犯對。	However, for these two types, it is like in the precept against killing, where humans and non-humans are contrasted in terms of seriousness, and one can also discuss the contrast of committing offenses and not committing offenses in relation to sentient beings and insentient beings.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b22_5']	於盜戒中有主無主，亦得更就人主非人主重輕相對也。	於盜戒中有主無主，亦得更就人主非人主重輕相對也。	In the precept against stealing, there are owners and non-owners, and one can also discuss the contrast of seriousness in relation to human owners and non-human owners.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b23_5']	若處分不處分對等定，更不得轉就重輕也。	若處分不處分對等定，更不得轉就重輕也。	If it is a matter of whether or not there is an assignment, it is definite, and one cannot further discuss the contrast of seriousness.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b23_19']	一切諸戒隨准應知，極為盡理。	一切諸戒隨准應知，極為盡理。	For all precepts, one should understand according to this standard, which is the most reasonable.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b24_12']	第四、大妄語戒，文有七句：	第四、大妄語戒，文有七句：	Fourth, the precept against great false speech has seven sentences:
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b24_18']	一、容犯人。	一、容犯人。	First, the person who may commit the offense.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b27_10']	二、「實無所知」者，於三慧中修慧所攝，無問世間及出世間、有漏無漏，各有加行無間解脫及勝進道，四道勝境皆謂所知。	二、「實無所知」者，於三慧中修慧所攝，無問世間及出世間、有漏無漏，各有加行無間解脫及勝進道，四道勝境皆謂所知。	Second, actually having no knowledge refers to the knowledge included in the three kinds of wisdom. Whether worldly or supramundane, contaminated or uncontaminated, each has the path of preparation, uninterrupted path, path of liberation, and path of advancement. The superior objects of the four paths are all called what is to be known.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b28_4']	今無所知，顯有凡法、無勝法也。	今無所知，顯有凡法、無勝法也。	Now, having no knowledge, it is clear that one has the dharmas of an ordinary person and lacks the superior dharmas.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b29_5']	三、「自稱言我得上人法」者，對他人境妄稱勝法。	三、「自稱言我得上人法」者，對他人境妄稱勝法。	Third, claiming to have attained the dharmas of a superior person means falsely claiming to have superior dharmas in relation to others.
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470b29_10']	文有三節：	文有三節：	The text has three parts:
['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470c01_4']	一總標，謂證勝法，故名上人法。	一總標，謂證勝法，故名上人法。	First, a general statement, referring to the dharmas of a superior person because of realizing superior dharmas.

['ZH_T40_1807_001:0470c02_21']	「勝法」者，世間有漏修慧所攝法也。	「勝法」者，世間有漏修慧所攝法也。	Superior dharmas refers to dharmas included in contaminated wisdom cultivated in the world.
