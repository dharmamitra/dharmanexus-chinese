['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c15_4']	謂有計度離得等有蘊得等性，如是諸法不與心相應故，說名為心不相應行，非如心所與心共一所依所緣相應而起。	謂有計度離得等有蘊得等性，如是諸法不與心相應故，說名為心不相應行，非如心所與心共一所依所緣相應而起。	It is said that there are those who conceive that apart from attainment, etc., there is the nature of attainment, etc., of the aggregates. These dharmas are not associated with the mind, therefore they are called formations not associated with the mind, unlike the mental factors that arise together with the mind, sharing the same basis and object, and being associated with the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c17_11']	說心言者，為顯此中所說得等是心種類，諸心所法所依所緣皆與心同亦心種類，為簡彼故言不相應。	說心言者，為顯此中所說得等是心種類，諸心所法所依所緣皆與心同亦心種類，為簡彼故言不相應。	The term mind is mentioned to show that attainment and so forth are types of mind, and that mental factors and their supports and objects are the same as mind and also types of mind. In order to distinguish them, it is said that they are not associated.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c19_3']	諸無為法亦心種類，無所依緣，故亦是不相應，為欲簡彼故復言行。	諸無為法亦心種類，無所依緣，故亦是不相應，為欲簡彼故復言行。	Unconditioned dharmas are also types of mind, but they have no support or object, so they are also not associated. In order to distinguish them, the term active is used again.

['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c24_1']	得、獲、成就，義雖是一，而依門異說差別名。	得、獲、成就，義雖是一，而依門異說差別名。	Although the meanings of attainment, acquisition, and accomplishment are the same, they are explained with different names based on different aspects.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c24_15']	得有二種，謂先未得及先已得。	得有二種，謂先未得及先已得。	There are two kinds of attainment: that which was not attained before and that which was already attained before.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c25_14']	先未得得說名為獲，先已得得說名成就。	先未得得說名為獲，先已得得說名成就。	The attainment of that which was not attained before is called acquisition, and the attainment of that which was already attained is called accomplishment.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c26_14']	應知非得與此相違，謂先未得及得已失。	應知非得與此相違，謂先未得及得已失。	You should understand that nonacquisition is the opposite of this. That is, it is that which has not yet been acquired or that which has been lost after being acquired.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c28_5']	未得非得說名不獲，已失非得名不成就，故說異生性名不獲聖法。	未得非得說名不獲，已失非得名不成就，故說異生性名不獲聖法。	Nonacquisition that has not yet been acquired is called nonobtainment. Nonacquisition that has been lost is called nonaccomplishment. Therefore it is said that the nature of an ordinary person is called nonobtainment of the holy dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0396c28_14']	於何法中有得非得？	於何法中有得非得？	In what dharmas does acquisition and nonacquisition exist?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a01_15']	且有為中於自相續有得非得，非他相續及非相續，若蘊墮在自相續中可有成就不成就故。	且有為中於自相續有得非得，非他相續及非相續，若蘊墮在自相續中可有成就不成就故。	In the conditioned, acquisition and nonacquisition exist in one’s own life stream, not in the life streams of others or in nonliving things, because one can possess or not possess the aggregates that fall into one’s own life stream.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a02_16']	他相續蘊及非情蘊，必無成就，不成就故。	他相續蘊及非情蘊，必無成就，不成就故。	The aggregates in the life streams of others and the aggregates of nonliving things are definitely not possessed or not possessed.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a03_9']	無為法中唯於二滅有得非得。	無為法中唯於二滅有得非得。	In the unconditioned, only cessation resulting from discrimination and cessation not resulting from discrimination have acquisition and nonacquisition.

['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a06_13']	謂一切有情，除初剎那具縛聖者及餘一切具縛異生，諸餘有情皆成擇滅。	謂一切有情，除初剎那具縛聖者及餘一切具縛異生，諸餘有情皆成擇滅。	All sentient beings, except for the first moment of the holy path in the life stream of one bound by all bonds, and all others bound by all bonds, all other sentient beings possess cessation resulting from discrimination.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a07_12']	決定無有成就虛空，以於虛空無有得故；	決定無有成就虛空，以於虛空無有得故；	There is definitely no one who attains space, because there is no attainment of space;

['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a09_18']	依此得故，說如是言：	依此得故，說如是言：	Based on this attainment, the following statement is made:
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a10_15']	色蘊行蘊一得所得，餘蘊行蘊說亦如是。	色蘊行蘊一得所得，餘蘊行蘊說亦如是。	The form aggregate and the formation aggregate are attained by one attainment, and the other aggregates and formations are also said to be the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a12_5']	有漏無漏一得所得，有為無為一得所得，如是等類如理應思。	有漏無漏一得所得，有為無為一得所得，如是等類如理應思。	Contaminated and uncontaminated dharmas are attained by one attainment, and conditioned and unconditioned dharmas are attained by one attainment. Such categories should be considered in the same way.

['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a13_4']	何緣知有別物名得？	何緣知有別物名得？	How do we know that there is a separate entity called attainment?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a13_9']	應答彼言：	應答彼言：	One should answer him as follows:
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a13_14']	契經說故。	契經說故。	Because it is said in the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a14_3']	如契經中薄伽梵說：	如契經中薄伽梵說：	As it is said in the scriptures, the Blessed One said:
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a15_2']	應知如是補特伽羅，成就善法及不善法。	應知如是補特伽羅，成就善法及不善法。	One should know that such a person has attained wholesome dharmas and unwholesome dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a16_1']	若謂經說有轉輪王成就七寶，有太過失。	若謂經說有轉輪王成就七寶，有太過失。	If one says that the scriptures speak of a wheel-turning king who has attained the seven treasures, that is an error of excess.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a16_20']	此難不然，王於七寶自在無礙，名成就故。	此難不然，王於七寶自在無礙，名成就故。	This objection is not reasonable, because the king has unrestricted mastery over the seven treasures and is therefore said to possess them.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a18_16']	若謂餘經所說成就亦應爾者，此亦不然，以現在者唯於現在有自在力，非過未故。	若謂餘經所說成就亦應爾者，此亦不然，以現在者唯於現在有自在力，非過未故。	If you say that the same is true of the possession spoken of in other scriptures, this is not reasonable, because the present has mastery over the present alone, not over the past and future.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a20_11']	謂轉輪王於現七寶有自在力，增上果故、恒現前故，隨樂而轉，可名成就。	謂轉輪王於現七寶有自在力，增上果故、恒現前故，隨樂而轉，可名成就。	This means that the wheel-turning king has mastery over the present seven treasures, because they are dominant results and are always present, and he can make them turn as he wishes, and for that reason he is said to possess them.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a21_1']	善不善法則不決定。	善不善法則不決定。	But this is not so of good and bad dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a22_18']	且如善法現在前時，補特伽羅於現善法可說成就，彼於過未不善法中應更指陳。	且如善法現在前時，補特伽羅於現善法可說成就，彼於過未不善法中應更指陳。	When, for example, good dharmas are present, one can say that the pudgala possesses present good dharmas, but he must be further specified as to past and future bad dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a23_13']	若無現得，由何別法說為自在？	若無現得，由何別法說為自在？	If there is no present acquisition, by virtue of what other dharma can one speak of mastery?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a24_3']	不善現前，徵善亦爾。	不善現前，徵善亦爾。	The same is true of the present bad dharmas when good dharmas are present.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a25_2']	況執過未全無體者，於何自在說名成就？	況執過未全無體者，於何自在說名成就？	How much more so for those who hold that the past and future are totally devoid of substance? Over what can one speak of possession?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a26_10']	若於未來有能生力名成就者，理亦不然，是則應有非愛過故。	若於未來有能生力名成就者，理亦不然，是則應有非愛過故。	If you claim that one is said to be in possession of a dharma because it has the power to produce it in the future, this is also unreasonable, because this would lead to the absurd consequence that one would possess what is not desirable.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a27_9']	謂諸異生住最後有定生無漏，應是聖者。	謂諸異生住最後有定生無漏，應是聖者。	That is, ordinary beings in their final existence who are definitely going to produce pure dharmas would be holy beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397a28_13']	諸阿羅漢住最後心，決定不能復生無漏，應非阿羅漢。	諸阿羅漢住最後心，決定不能復生無漏，應非阿羅漢。	Arhats in their final thought would definitely be unable to produce pure dharmas again and would not be arhats.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b01_1']	便退成異生，住世俗忍見，所斷煩惱必不復生，應是預流果。	便退成異生，住世俗忍見，所斷煩惱必不復生，應是預流果。	They would fall back and become ordinary beings. The passions that are to be eliminated by the path of insight of the mundane realm would never arise again and they would be the fruit of stream-enterer.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b01_15']	又若許有別物名得，有何非理？	又若許有別物名得，有何非理？	Also, if you admit that there is a separate thing called possession, what is unreasonable about that?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b02_9']	如是非理，謂所執得，無體可知。	如是非理，謂所執得，無體可知。	The reason is unreasonable, because the possession that you hold is not something that can be known as having substance,
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b03_17']	如色聲等或貪瞋等，無用可知，如眼耳等，故無容有別物名得。	如色聲等或貪瞋等，無用可知，如眼耳等，故無容有別物名得。	like form, sound, etc., or greed, hatred, etc., nor is it something that can be known as having a function, like the eyes, ears, etc. Therefore, there is no such thing as a separate thing called possession.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b04_7']	執有別物，是為非理。	執有別物，是為非理。	To hold that there is a separate thing is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b04_17']	此定不然，非非理故。	此定不然，非非理故。	This is definitely not so, because it is not unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b05_10']	由所許得是已得法，不失因故。	由所許得是已得法，不失因故。	This is because the possession that is admitted is the cause of not losing a dharma that has been acquired.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b06_4']	又是知此繫屬於彼，智幖幟故。	又是知此繫屬於彼，智幖幟故。	It is also the sign of the knowledge that this is bound to that.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b07_3']	除此更有何別大用能過於此，說此為無？	除此更有何別大用能過於此，說此為無？	Apart from this, what other great function is there that surpasses this, such that it is said to be non-existent?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b07_13']	若爾，何用執此得為？	若爾，何用執此得為？	If so, then what is the use of positing this attainment?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b09_2']	唯所依中有諸種子，未拔未損增長自在，於如是位立成就名。	唯所依中有諸種子，未拔未損增長自在，於如是位立成就名。	Only in the basis of support, where the seeds exist, not yet removed or damaged, and are able to grow freely, is the state of accomplishment established.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b10_1']	由斯不失已得諸法，亦此屬彼智之幖幟。	由斯不失已得諸法，亦此屬彼智之幖幟。	By this, one does not lose the dharmas already attained, and it is also the sign of the knowledge that this belongs to that.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b10_6']	此復云何？	此復云何？	What is this again?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b10_15', 'ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b12_3']	且諸善法略有二種：🔽一者不由功力修得、二者要由功力修得，即名生得及加行得。	且諸善法略有二種： 一者不由功力修得、二者要由功力修得，即名生得及加行得。	Moreover, the good dharmas are roughly of two kinds:🔽The first is not attained through the cultivation of effort, and the second is attained only through the cultivation of effort, which are called innate and acquired.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b14_1']	不由功力而修得者，若所依中種未被損名為成就，若所依中種已被損名不成就。	不由功力而修得者，若所依中種未被損名為成就，若所依中種已被損名不成就。	As for those not attained through the cultivation of effort, if the seeds in the basis of support have not yet been damaged, it is called accomplishment. If the seeds in the basis of support have already been damaged, it is called non-accomplishment.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b16_2']	謂斷善者由邪見力損所依中善根種子應知名斷，非所依中善根種子畢竟被害說名為斷。	謂斷善者由邪見力損所依中善根種子應知名斷，非所依中善根種子畢竟被害說名為斷。	That is, when the roots of good are severed, the seeds of the roots of good in the support are damaged by the power of wrong views, and this is called severance. It is not said that the roots of good in the support are completely destroyed that are called severed.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b17_15']	要由功力而修得者，若所依中彼法已起，生彼功力自在無損，說名成就；	要由功力而修得者，若所依中彼法已起，生彼功力自在無損，說名成就；	That which must be cultivated by the power of effort is called possession if the dharma in the support has already arisen and the power of its birth is sovereign and not damaged.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b18_4']	與此相違，名不成就。	與此相違，名不成就。	The opposite of this is called nonpossession.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b19_12']	不善無記，由對治道斷伏種子，或無功力可生現行，名不成就；	不善無記，由對治道斷伏種子，或無功力可生現行，名不成就；	Bad and indeterminate dharmas are called nonpossession when their seeds are destroyed or subdued by the path of opposition or when there is no power to generate actual dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b20_2']	與此相違，名為成就。	與此相違，名為成就。	The opposite of this is called possession.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b20_11']	故所執得便為無用。	故所執得便為無用。	Therefore the possession that you affirm is useless.

['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b26_13']	且汝所執唯應爾所，若言是總，種體應假，假為實因不應正理。	且汝所執唯應爾所，若言是總，種體應假，假為實因不應正理。	Moreover, what you grasp should be just that much. If you say it is general, the substance of the seeds should be provisional, and it is not reasonable for a provisional [dharma] to be the cause of a real [dharma].
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b27_15']	若言是別，如何可執無記色種為善不善諸法生因？	若言是別，如何可執無記色種為善不善諸法生因？	If you say it is specific, how can you grasp the seeds of indeterminate form as the cause for the arising of good and bad dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397b29_1']	若自種類善法無間不善法生或復相違，以何為種？	若自種類善法無間不善法生或復相違，以何為種？	If good dharmas arise immediately after bad dharmas, or vice versa, what is the seed?

Because of the differences in volition that arise together with the previous mind, there are differences in the abilities of the subsequent mind. The differences in abilities on the subsequent mind are called seeds. Due to this, the transformation of the continuity [of mind] gives rise to future fruits.
['ZH_T29_1562_012:0397c04_14']	此中意說，不善心中有善所引展轉隣近功能差別以為種子，從此無間善法得生；	此中意說，不善心中有善所引展轉隣近功能差別以為種子，從此無間善法得生；	What is meant here is that in an unwholesome mind there is a special ability that is induced by good [karma] and is proximate, which serves as the seed.
