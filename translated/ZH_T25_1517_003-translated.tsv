['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907a12_13']	行相云何？	行相云何？	What is its mode of activity?
['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907a13_9']	自性者謂本性不虛假，即真我性。	自性者謂本性不虛假，即真我性。	Intrinsic nature refers to the essential nature that is not false or deceptive, which is the nature of true self.
['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907a14_7']	於自性中有如是相，如摩尼寶映現和合。	於自性中有如是相，如摩尼寶映現和合。	Within intrinsic nature there are such characteristics, like a maṇi jewel reflecting and combining.

['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907a16_7']	此如是說，即自性清淨。	此如是說，即自性清淨。	This is called the intrinsic purity.

['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907a20_2']	此所作已，所有世尊增上意樂事等，即彼實際真如法界。	此所作已，所有世尊增上意樂事等，即彼實際真如法界。	When this is accomplished, all the matters of the World-Honored One's superior intention and so forth are the ultimate reality, the true suchness of the dharma realm.

['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907a24_4']	清淨之義已如前釋。	清淨之義已如前釋。	The meaning of purity has already been explained above.

['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907b02_15']	此中云何？	此中云何？	What does this mean?
['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907b05_7']	謂即所有般若波羅蜜多，諸有所說言義自性，謂佛世尊一切如是，當知皆依三種相說，非離依他等自性別有所成義。	謂即所有般若波羅蜜多，諸有所說言義自性，謂佛世尊一切如是，當知皆依三種相說，非離依他等自性別有所成義。	It means that all the prajñā-pāramitā that is spoken of has its own nature, which is to say that all of this of the World-Honored Buddha is to be known as spoken based on three kinds of characteristics, and apart from the nature of the other-dependent and so forth, there is no meaning to be accomplished.
['ZH_T25_1517_003:0907b05_16', 'ZH_T25_1517_003:0907b07_2']	此中所說行相云何？🔽謂若幻喻等見邊說已，即是說彼依他起性而無別異；	此中所說行相云何？ 謂若幻喻等見邊說已，即是說彼依他起性而無別異；	What are the aspects of practice taught here?🔽If the view of illusions and so forth is explained, then that is explained as being no different from the dependent nature;
