To fully understand the wondrous principle, one must rely on metaphors and analogies. Therefore, within the nameless, names are forcefully established.

This sutra takes the inconceivable cause and effect of the principle of the arising of the dharma realm as its main purport.

Each and every one is the same as the real principle and is the gate of the great dependent origination of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T36_1737_001:0702a12_6']	語理實則寂寥虛曠，故經云：	語理實則寂寥虛曠，故經云：	001	Speaking of the real principle, it is tranquil, vast, and empty. Therefore, the sūtra says:
['ZH_T36_1737_001:0702a13_18']	「法性本寂無諸相，猶如虛空不分別，超諸取著絕言道，真實平等常清淨。	「法性本寂無諸相，猶如虛空不分別，超諸取著絕言道，真實平等常清淨。	001	The nature of dharmas is originally quiescent, without any characteristics, like empty space, without discrimination, transcending all attachments and beyond words, truly equal, always pure.

By harmonizing cause and effect with ultimate reality, they penetrate each other repeatedly. Unifying these two and returning to the Dharma realm, they are harmoniously integrated and hidden. Therefore, the sūtra says, In the realm of conditioned arising, one demonstrates unconditioned dharmas without destroying the characteristics of conditioned arising;

['ZH_T36_1737_001:0702a28_7']	今一乘玄旨，一體不分，即實之權釋迦標號，即權之實即是遮那。	今一乘玄旨，一體不分，即實之權釋迦標號，即權之實即是遮那。	001	Now, the profound meaning of the One Vehicle is that the One Body is undivided. The expedient is precisely the real, and Śākyamuni is the one who bears the title. The real is precisely the expedient, and this is precisely Vairocana.

The perfect brightness is uniquely radiant. It provisionally establishes this name. In reality, in the Saha world, there are hundreds of billions of ten thousand names. Exhausting the Dharma realm, the names are endless. According to the capacities of beings, the one or many are in the capacities.

['ZH_T36_1737_001:0703a23_11']	去住不同、人天處別，如何經說不起覺樹而昇三天？	去住不同、人天處別，如何經說不起覺樹而昇三天？	001	Since leaving and staying are different, and the realms of humans and gods are separate, how does the sutra say that one does not rise from the Bodhi tree but ascends to the three heavens?
['ZH_T36_1737_001:0703a24_15']	又許不起而昇，理應齊等，如何獨三賢會而有此言？	又許不起而昇，理應齊等，如何獨三賢會而有此言？	001	Moreover, if it is allowed that one does not rise but ascends, the principle should be equally applied. Why is there this statement only in the assembly of the three sages?

Essence and function are unobstructed, and one and many are at ease. Without dividing, he is everywhere. Without leaving, he is all-pervading. Responding to conditions, he freely communicates. Seeing has a sequence of before and after.

If there is a response in the heavenly palace, he is seen ascending to the heavens. It is not that the Buddha moves from the Bodhi tree to ascend to the heavens.
['ZH_T36_1737_001:0703b03_3']	故法慧菩薩云：	故法慧菩薩云：	001	Therefore, the Bodhisattva of Dharma Wisdom said:

The majestic spiritual powers of all Buddhas can be measured in terms of benefiting and delighting. However, in transforming beings, the main point lies in having affinities.

The perfect seed in hell results in sudden transcendence, while the two vehicles lack the capacity and do not see it even when facing it.

The Lotus Sutra uses awe-inspiring methods to encourage those in the assembly, and the non-contemptuous one makes them hear and know of the distant benefits.

If one only discusses principle, there is nothing that can be immediately included. Now, when a single phenomenon that is not different from principle completely includes the nature of principle, it causes the many phenomena that are not different from principle to all appear within the one, following the principle that they rely on.

If a single phenomenon completely includes principle, but the many phenomena do not appear following it, then phenomena will be outside of principle.
