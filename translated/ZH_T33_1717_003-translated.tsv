However, the three masters are slightly similar to Guangzhai, but they are not as good as Guangzhai's use of the three asaṃkhyeya kalpas for bodhisattvas. Therefore, it is known that Guangzhai has three points that can be reconciled, but there is no single point that can be returned to. Since there is no single point that can be returned to, the refutation does not become marvelous. Since the explanation of the past is too general, the refutation is not really a refutation.
