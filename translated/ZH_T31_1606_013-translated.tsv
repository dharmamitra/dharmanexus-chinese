['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a08_6']	略說有二種，謂建立補特伽羅、建立現觀。	略說有二種，謂建立補特伽羅、建立現觀。	In brief, there are two kinds, namely, establishing the pudgala and establishing the abhisamaya.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a08_16']	前為能證，後是所證。	前為能證，後是所證。	The former is the means of realization, and the latter is what is realized.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a11_1']	補特伽羅雖非實有，由四種緣是故建立，謂言說易故、順世間故、離怖畏故、顯示自他具德失故。	補特伽羅雖非實有，由四種緣是故建立，謂言說易故、順世間故、離怖畏故、顯示自他具德失故。	Although the pudgala does not really exist, it is established for four reasons, namely, for the sake of easy speech, for the sake of conforming to the world, for the sake of avoiding fear, and for the sake of showing oneself and others as possessing merits and faults.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a13_10']	言說易者，若於無量色等差別、無量差別相想法中，總合建立一假有情，即呼召往來等種種言說遂不為難。	言說易者，若於無量色等差別、無量差別相想法中，總合建立一假有情，即呼召往來等種種言說遂不為難。	As for easy speech, if one generally combines and establishes a single hypothetical sentient being among the innumerable distinctions of form and so forth, and the innumerable distinctions of conceptual thoughts, then the various kinds of speech such as calling out, coming and going, and so forth will not be difficult.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a16_5']	順世間者，非諸世間唯依法想而起言說，多分依有情想而起言說，是故聖者為化世間，必應同彼方便建立補特伽羅。	順世間者，非諸世間唯依法想而起言說，多分依有情想而起言說，是故聖者為化世間，必應同彼方便建立補特伽羅。	As for “in accordance with the world,” the world does not only give rise to verbal expression based on the notion of dharmas. For the most part, it gives rise to verbal expression based on the notion of sentient beings. Therefore, the sages, in order to transform the world, must necessarily establish the pudgala in the same way as the world.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a18_3']	離怖畏者，世間有情未會甚深緣起法性，若聞一切有情無我，便生怖畏不受正化。	離怖畏者，世間有情未會甚深緣起法性，若聞一切有情無我，便生怖畏不受正化。	As for “free from fear,” sentient beings in the world have not yet encountered the profound nature of dependent origination. If they hear that all sentient beings are without self, they will give rise to fear and will not accept the correct teaching.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a22_3']	顯示自他具德失者，若離假立有情差別，唯說諸法染淨相者，是則一切無有差別，不可了知如是身中如此過失若斷未斷、如是身中如此功德若證未證，是故建立補特伽羅。	顯示自他具德失者，若離假立有情差別，唯說諸法染淨相者，是則一切無有差別，不可了知如是身中如此過失若斷未斷、如是身中如此功德若證未證，是故建立補特伽羅。	As for “revealing the virtues and faults possessed by oneself and others,” if one only speaks of the characteristics of defilement and purity of dharmas, without establishing the differences in sentient beings, then all will be without distinction, and it will be impossible to know whether such faults are eliminated or not eliminated in such a body, or whether such merits are realized or not realized in such a body. Therefore, the pudgala is established.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a23_4']	云何建立？	云何建立？	How is it established?
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753a25_10']	略有七種，謂病行差別故、出離差別故、任持差別故、方便差別故、果差別故、界差別故、修行差別故。	略有七種，謂病行差別故、出離差別故、任持差別故、方便差別故、果差別故、界差別故、修行差別故。	In brief, there are seven kinds, namely, because of differences in the practice of illness, differences in liberation, differences in support, differences in skillful means, differences in fruits, differences in realms, and differences in cultivation.

['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b08_7']	界差別者，謂欲界異生有學無學。	界差別者，謂欲界異生有學無學。	The differences in realms are: ordinary beings, learners, and adepts in the desire realm.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b09_2']	如欲界有，三色界無色界亦爾。	如欲界有，三色界無色界亦爾。	Just as there are three in the desire realm, so it is in the form and formless realms.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b10_5']	又有欲色界菩薩，又有欲界獨覺，不可思議如來。	又有欲色界菩薩，又有欲界獨覺，不可思議如來。	Moreover, there are bodhisattvas in the desire and form realms, and pratyekabuddhas and inconceivable tathāgatas in the desire realm.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b10_14']	修行差別略有五種：	修行差別略有五種：	The differences in practice are roughly fivefold:
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b12_14']	一勝解行菩薩、二增上意樂行菩薩、三有相行菩薩、四無相行菩薩、五無功用行菩薩。	一勝解行菩薩、二增上意樂行菩薩、三有相行菩薩、四無相行菩薩、五無功用行菩薩。	The first is the bodhisattva of superior resolve, the second is the bodhisattva of superior intention, the third is the bodhisattva of conceptualized practice, the fourth is the bodhisattva of signless practice, and the fifth is the bodhisattva of effortless practice.

['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b15_14']	貪行補特伽羅者，謂有猛利長時貪欲，雖於下劣可愛境界而能發起上品貪故，起即長時無斷絕故。	貪行補特伽羅者，謂有猛利長時貪欲，雖於下劣可愛境界而能發起上品貪故，起即長時無斷絕故。	A person of lustful disposition means one with intense and long-lasting lust.

['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b17_3']	如貪行者，乃至尋思行者亦爾，各隨自境猛利長時，如理配釋。	如貪行者，乃至尋思行者亦爾，各隨自境猛利長時，如理配釋。	As with a person of lustful disposition, so it is with a person of discursive thought. Each should be matched with their own objects, intense and long-lasting, and explained accordingly.
['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b20_3']	等分行補特伽羅者，謂住自性位煩惱，遠離猛劣，住平等位諸煩惱故，隨境界勢力煩惱現行故。	等分行補特伽羅者，謂住自性位煩惱，遠離猛劣，住平等位諸煩惱故，隨境界勢力煩惱現行故。	A person of equal disposition means one who abides in the natural state, far from intense and weak afflictions, abiding in the state of equality of various afflictions, and whose afflictions manifest in accordance with the power of objects.

['ZH_T31_1606_013:0753b28_8']	聲聞乘補特伽羅者，謂住聲聞法性，若定不定性，是鈍根，自求解脫發弘正願，修厭離貪解脫意樂，以聲聞藏為所緣境，精進修行法隨法行，得盡苦際。	聲聞乘補特伽羅者，謂住聲聞法性，若定不定性，是鈍根，自求解脫發弘正願，修厭離貪解脫意樂，以聲聞藏為所緣境，精進修行法隨法行，得盡苦際。	The person of the śrāvaka vehicle refers to one who abides in the nature of the śrāvakas, whether of fixed or unfixed nature, who is of dull faculties, seeks liberation for oneself, makes the great correct vow, cultivates the intention of detachment and freedom from craving, takes the śrāvaka canon as the object, diligently practices the practice of the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, and attains the end of suffering.
