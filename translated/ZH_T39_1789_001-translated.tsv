['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343a14_1']	法運之興，雖曰在人，亦必有其時焉。	法運之興，雖曰在人，亦必有其時焉。	The rise of the Dharma, although said to be in the hands of people, must also have its time.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343a15_9']	有其人而無其時、有其時而無其人，雖欲興之，其可得哉？	有其人而無其時、有其時而無其人，雖欲興之，其可得哉？	Having the people but not the time, having the time but not the people, even if one wishes to promote it, how can it be achieved?
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343a16_19']	是故必有聰明聖智之君、當天下又安之時，以興之也。	是故必有聰明聖智之君、當天下又安之時，以興之也。	Therefore, it must be promoted by a wise, sagacious, and intelligent ruler, when the world is at peace.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343a20_5']	至若《楞伽》一經，我大覺世尊說之於二千年之前，而今上皇帝行之於二千年之後，豈非有其人而有其時乎？	至若《楞伽》一經，我大覺世尊說之於二千年之前，而今上皇帝行之於二千年之後，豈非有其人而有其時乎？	As for the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, our Great Awakened World-Honored One spoke of it two thousand years ago, and now the present emperor practices it two thousand years later. Isn't it because there is such a person and such a time?
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343a23_15']	不然，何此經東流中國千有餘載，前代帝王未曾有如我聖天子之留神注意，究其旨趣，　勅僧徒咸隷習之，有如此之盛也。	不然，何此經東流中國千有餘載，前代帝王未曾有如我聖天子之留神注意，究其旨趣，　勅僧徒咸隷習之，有如此之盛也。	Otherwise, why is it that this sūtra has flowed eastward to China for over a thousand years, and the emperors of previous dynasties have never been as attentive and focused as our sagely emperor in investigating its purport, ordering monks to all study and practice it, and having such great prosperity?
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343a25_6']	然吾佛之所以說此經者，蓋欲除眾生之妄心，俾歸於真正之道。	然吾佛之所以說此經者，蓋欲除眾生之妄心，俾歸於真正之道。	However, the reason why our Buddha spoke this sūtra is precisely to eliminate the deluded minds of sentient beings and cause them to return to the true and proper path.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343a28_4']	而皇上之心，欲天下後世之人皆捨妄歸真、去惡從善，以躋乎仁壽之域，其有契於佛之心乎！	而皇上之心，欲天下後世之人皆捨妄歸真、去惡從善，以躋乎仁壽之域，其有契於佛之心乎！	And the emperor's heart desires that the people of the world and future generations will all abandon delusion and return to truth, cast off evil and follow goodness, and ascend to the realm of benevolent longevity. Does this accord with the Buddha's heart?
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b01_4']	且此經之要，不出五法、三自性、八識、二無我，而該乎真妄修性、聖凡因果，皆不外乎一心。	且此經之要，不出五法、三自性、八識、二無我，而該乎真妄修性、聖凡因果，皆不外乎一心。	Moreover, the essentials of this sūtra are not beyond the five dharmas, three natures, eight consciousnesses, and two kinds of no-self, yet they encompass the true, false, cultivation, nature, sages, ordinary beings, causes, and effects, all of which are not beyond the one mind.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b02_12']	能究此心者，則畏惡而遷善、捨妄而歸真，得至自覺正智之地。	能究此心者，則畏惡而遷善、捨妄而歸真，得至自覺正智之地。	Those who can investigate this mind will be afraid of evil and move towards goodness, abandon falsehood and return to truth, and attain the stage of correct wisdom of self-realization.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b04_12']	不能究此心者，則縱情肆欲，流而忘返，至于失其忠孝，敗俗亂常，甘蹈刑辟，如履水火。	不能究此心者，則縱情肆欲，流而忘返，至于失其忠孝，敗俗亂常，甘蹈刑辟，如履水火。	Those who cannot investigate this mind will indulge their emotions and desires, flow and forget their return, even to the point of losing their loyalty and filial piety, ruining customs and causing chaos, willingly stepping into punishment like walking in water or fire.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b06_13']	此吾佛所以興大悲心而拔濟之，亦猶帝王之仁育黎庶若保赤子者也。	此吾佛所以興大悲心而拔濟之，亦猶帝王之仁育黎庶若保赤子者也。	This is why our Buddha gives rise to the mind of great compassion to rescue them, just as the emperor benevolently nurtures the common people as if protecting infants.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b10_16']	臣僧宗泐、如玘昨於　內廷欽承聖諭，以為《心經》、《金剛》、《楞伽》三經，實治心法門，遣情離著，具在是矣，爾輩可不勉乎？	臣僧宗泐、如玘昨於　內廷欽承聖諭，以為《心經》、《金剛》、《楞伽》三經，實治心法門，遣情離著，具在是矣，爾輩可不勉乎？	The monk disciples Zongle and Ruqi were recently honored with the imperial edict in the inner court, which stated that the three sutras of the Heart Sutra, Diamond Sutra, and Lankavatara Sutra are indeed the methods for governing the mind, dispelling emotions, and detaching from attachments, and that you all should strive for it.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b14_5']	臣等受命以來，夙夜兢惕，懼無以上副宸衷，於是竭誠殫慮，註釋《心經》、《金剛》二典，已於洪武十一年正月二十八日　奏準行世。	臣等受命以來，夙夜兢惕，懼無以上副宸衷，於是竭誠殫慮，註釋《心經》、《金剛》二典，已於洪武十一年正月二十八日　奏準行世。	Since receiving the imperial decree, we have been diligent day and night, fearing that we would not be able to fulfill the imperial intention. We have then exhausted our sincerity and thoughts to annotate the Heart Sutra and Diamond Sutra. On the twenty-eighth day of the first month in the eleventh year of Hongwu, we submitted the annotations for printing and distribution.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b16_4']	而《楞伽》以今七月初十日始克註成，謹熏沐繕寫，拜手稽首，詣　闕進呈。	而《楞伽》以今七月初十日始克註成，謹熏沐繕寫，拜手稽首，詣　闕進呈。	As for the Lankavatara Sutra, it was completed on the tenth day of the seventh month this year. We have respectfully copied it, bowed our heads, and presented it to the imperial court.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b17_8']	重念臣等才識庸陋，學術空疎，固不敢叨於註釋之列。	重念臣等才識庸陋，學術空疎，固不敢叨於註釋之列。	We repeatedly think that our talents and knowledge are shallow and our studies are superficial. We certainly dare not presume to be included in the ranks of annotators.
['ZH_T39_1789_001:0343b19_17']	然承　雨露之餘澤，依日月之清光，庶幾少裨流通之萬一云爾。	然承　雨露之餘澤，依日月之清光，庶幾少裨流通之萬一云爾。	However, by receiving the remaining grace of the rain and dew, and relying on the clear light of the sun and moon, I may slightly contribute to the circulation of the Dharma by a thousandth of a part.
