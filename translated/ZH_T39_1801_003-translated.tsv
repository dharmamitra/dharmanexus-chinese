['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b13_9']	但以人天不能數知，故言無量。	但以人天不能數知，故言無量。	But because humans and gods cannot count it, it is said to be immeasurable.

['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b18_16']	故《光明疏》云「智既應冥，亦非身非不身。	故《光明疏》云「智既應冥，亦非身非不身。	Therefore, the Guangming Commentary says, When wisdom responds and merges, it is neither a body nor not a body.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b19_7']	」《請觀》既亦二字，足驗體同。	」《請觀》既亦二字，足驗體同。	Since the request for contemplation also has two characters, it is sufficient to verify that the essence is the same.

['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b23_12']	但此釋迦應穢土機緣宜短，故生身是八十及七百阿僧祇也。	但此釋迦應穢土機緣宜短，故生身是八十及七百阿僧祇也。	However, this Shakyamuni responds to the karmic conditions of the defiled land, which are suitable for being short, so the born body is eighty and seven hundred asamkhyeya kalpas.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b24_11']	彼彌陀應淨土機緣宜長，故壽無量也。	彼彌陀應淨土機緣宜長，故壽無量也。	That Amitabha responds to the karmic conditions of the pure land, which are suitable for being long, so the lifespan is immeasurable.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b25_8']	「而實有數」者，非人天所知，云無量爾。	「而實有數」者，非人天所知，云無量爾。	But there is actually a number means it is not known by humans or gods, so it is said to be immeasurable.

['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b27_7']	例此，彌陀亦現有量也。	例此，彌陀亦現有量也。	By analogy, Amitâbha also manifests a limited lifespan.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b28_8']	故《光明疏》云「應佛皆為兩量，逐物參差長短。	故《光明疏》云「應佛皆為兩量，逐物參差長短。	Therefore, the Guangming Sutra Commentary says, The response Buddhas all have two lifespans, following conditions with varying lengths.

['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989b29_4']	《光明》談山海之壽，故以常果為宗。	《光明》談山海之壽，故以常果為宗。	Since the Guangming Sutra speaks of the lifespan of mountains and seas, it takes the eternal fruition as its main point.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c01_3']	若例彌陀，終成有量，則是無常，何云常果？	若例彌陀，終成有量，則是無常，何云常果？	If it is taken as an analogy for Amitâbha, it will ultimately be limited, which is impermanent. How can it be called the eternal fruition?

['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c02_1']	池水深則蓮花大，法體常則應用遠。	池水深則蓮花大，法體常則應用遠。	If the water in the pond is deep, then the lotus flowers are large. If the essence of the Dharma is eternal, then its applications are far-reaching.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c03_11']	山海是常體之用，故談大用足顯體常，以斷信相執八十無常之疑也。	山海是常體之用，故談大用足顯體常，以斷信相執八十無常之疑也。	Mountains and seas are the function of the eternal essence, so speaking of the great function is enough to reveal the essence's eternity, to resolve Xin Xiang's doubt about the eighty-year lifespan being impermanent.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c05_6']	而彼疏從容以報身當品題者，取其上冥下應義便爾，實明應身能為常也。	而彼疏從容以報身當品題者，取其上冥下應義便爾，實明應身能為常也。	As for the commentary's suggestion that the reward body corresponds to the chapter title, it takes the meaning of merging above and responding below as convenient, but in reality it clarifies that the response body can be eternal.

['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c11_1']	經說彌陀從彼來此，彼優此劣豈是真耶？	經說彌陀從彼來此，彼優此劣豈是真耶？	The sutra says that Amitabha comes from there to here, and that they are superior and this is inferior, how can this be true?
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c11_11']	「若彼」下，次意也。	「若彼」下，次意也。	If it is... below, is the second meaning.

['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c17_8']	而諸經偏讚為淨者，形此土故、由物機故、是攝生故、令專注故、宿緣厚故、約多分故。	而諸經偏讚為淨者，形此土故、由物機故、是攝生故、令專注故、宿緣厚故、約多分故。	But the sūtras praise it as pure because it contrasts with this land, due to the capacities of beings, because it is for guiding sentient beings, because it causes them to focus single-mindedly, because of thick past affinities, and because it is mostly so.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c18_4']	「此語則寬」者，以久本今迹俱應身故。	「此語則寬」者，以久本今迹俱應身故。	This statement is too broad means that both the distant original and the present traces are the responsive body.
['ZH_T39_1801_003:0989c19_4']	此一往許之也，二往不可，故云「今亦不用」。	此一往許之也，二往不可，故云「今亦不用」。	This is a one-sided allowance, but in the second sense it is not possible, so it says I will not use it now.
