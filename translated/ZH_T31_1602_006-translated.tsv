['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507a21_7']	真如者，謂法無我所顯、聖智所行、一切言說所不依處。	真如者，謂法無我所顯、聖智所行、一切言說所不依處。	006	Suchness is that which is revealed by the selflessness of dharmas, that which is practiced by the wisdom of the sages, and that which is not the basis for any verbal expressions.

Moreover, because that right knowledge often appears before them, they quickly attain the purification of the obstacle of the passions.

['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507b18_15']	又若略說者，謂此是此非彼，如是謂彼是彼非餘。	又若略說者，謂此是此非彼，如是謂彼是彼非餘。	006	Moreover, if briefly explained, it refers to this being this and not that, and that being that and not others.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507b21_10']	若事世間有情決定勝解所行，一切世間自昔傳來名言決定自他分別，共為真實，非邪思搆觀察所取，是名世間真實。	若事世間有情決定勝解所行，一切世間自昔傳來名言決定自他分別，共為真實，非邪思搆觀察所取，是名世間真實。	006	If a matter is definitely the domain of the resolve of worldly beings, and is the definite discrimination of self and others through the names and expressions that have been transmitted from ancient times by all worldly beings together, it is considered to be the ultimate truth, not grasped through false conceptualization and analysis. This is called the mundane ultimate.

['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507b26_16']	以證成道理所建立故，是名道理真實。	以證成道理所建立故，是名道理真實。	006	Because it is established by the principle of reasoning, this is called the principle of reality.

['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507c03_6']	此中何者是真實？	此中何者是真實？	006	What is the ultimate truth among these?

['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507c05_9']	謂苦集滅道名之所顯四種聖諦，由簡擇如是四聖諦故得入現觀位，於現觀位中真實智生。	謂苦集滅道名之所顯四種聖諦，由簡擇如是四聖諦故得入現觀位，於現觀位中真實智生。	006	The four noble truths revealed by the term, namely suffering, origination, cessation, and path. By discriminating these four noble truths, one enters the stage of realization. In the stage of realization, the knowledge of ultimate truth arises.

['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507c16_6']	名尋思者，謂諸菩薩於名唯見名。	名尋思者，謂諸菩薩於名唯見名。	006	Thorough investigation of names means that bodhisattvas only see names as names.

['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507c20_3']	差別假立尋思者，謂諸菩薩於差別假立唯見差別假立，是名差別假立尋思。	差別假立尋思者，謂諸菩薩於差別假立唯見差別假立，是名差別假立尋思。	006	Thorough investigation of the positing of distinctions means that bodhisattvas only see the positing of distinctions as the positing of distinctions. This is called thorough investigation of the positing of distinctions.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507c22_2']	此諸菩薩於名事二種，或離相觀，或合相觀，依名事合觀故，通達自體假立差別假立。	此諸菩薩於名事二種，或離相觀，或合相觀，依名事合觀故，通達自體假立差別假立。	006	These bodhisattvas either observe names and things separately or combine them. Based on the combined observation of names and things, they penetrate the positing of self-natures and the positing of distinctions.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507c25_15']	四種如實智者，一名尋思所引如實智、二事尋思所引如實智、三自體假立尋思所引如實智、四差別假立尋思所引如實智。	四種如實智者，一名尋思所引如實智、二事尋思所引如實智、三自體假立尋思所引如實智、四差別假立尋思所引如實智。	006	As for the four kinds of knowledge of reality, the first is the knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of names, the second is the knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of things, the third is the knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of the positing of self-natures, and the fourth is the knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of the positing of distinctions.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0507c28_17']	名尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於名尋思唯有名已，於名如實了知，謂此名為此義故於此事中建立，為令世間起想見言說故。	名尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於名尋思唯有名已，於名如實了知，謂此名為此義故於此事中建立，為令世間起想見言說故。	006	As for the knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of names, it is because when bodhisattvas investigate names, they only find names. Having investigated names, they understand names as they really are, thinking: This name is established for this meaning in this thing, in order to cause the world to give rise to thoughts, views, and speech.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a01_8']	若於色等所想事中不為建立色等名者，一切世間無有能想此事；	若於色等所想事中不為建立色等名者，一切世間無有能想此事；	006	If one does not establish names such as form for things that are thought of, such as form, then no one in the world would be able to think of them;
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a02_6']	是色等若無想者，無有能起增益執著；	是色等若無想者，無有能起增益執著；	006	if there were no thoughts of form, etc., then no one would be able to give rise to the grasping of reifications;
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a02_15']	若不執著則無言說。	若不執著則無言說。	006	if there were no grasping, then there would be no speech.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a03_17']	若如是如實了知，是名第一名尋思所引如實智。	若如是如實了知，是名第一名尋思所引如實智。	006	If one understands in this way as it really is, this is called the first knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of names.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a06_18', 'ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a10_4']	事尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於事尋思唯有事已，如實了知色等所想事性，離一切言說不可言說，是名第二事尋思所引如實智。🔽自體假立尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於色等所想事假立自體中尋思唯假立，故如實通達假立自體，非實彼事自體而似彼事自體顯現。	事尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於事尋思唯有事已，如實了知色等所想事性，離一切言說不可言說，是名第二事尋思所引如實智。 自體假立尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於色等所想事假立自體中尋思唯假立，故如實通達假立自體，非實彼事自體而似彼事自體顯現。	006	The knowledge of reality induced by investigation of objects means that by bodhisattvas investigating only objects in objects, they truly understand that the nature of objects such as form that are conceptualized is apart from all speech and cannot be spoken of. This is called the second knowledge of reality induced by investigation of objects.🔽The knowledge of reality induced by investigation of the designation of substance means that by bodhisattvas investigating only the designation in the substance that is conceptually designated in objects such as form, they truly penetrate the designated substance and understand that the substance of those objects is not real but appears as if it were the substance of those objects.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a13_1']	又能了知彼事自體，猶如變化影像響應光影水月焰水夢幻似有體性，是名第三自體假立尋思所引甚深義所行境如實智。	又能了知彼事自體，猶如變化影像響應光影水月焰水夢幻似有體性，是名第三自體假立尋思所引甚深義所行境如實智。	006	And they are also able to understand that the substance of those objects is like an illusion, a reflection, an echo, a shadow, the moon in the water, a mirage, a dream, or an apparition, with a nature that seems to exist. This is called the third knowledge of reality induced by investigation of the designation of substance, the knowledge of reality that takes as its object the profound meaning that is investigated.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a16_13']	差別假立尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於差別假立尋思唯假立性故，於色等所想事差別假立中善能通達不二之義。	差別假立尋思所引如實智者，由諸菩薩於差別假立尋思唯假立性故，於色等所想事差別假立中善能通達不二之義。	006	The knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of the establishment of distinctions is as follows: because bodhisattvas investigate the establishment of distinctions as only established, they are well able to penetrate the non-dual meaning in the establishment of distinctions regarding things such as form that are imagined.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a18_2']	謂彼諸事非有性非無性，由可言說自體不成就故，非有性；	謂彼諸事非有性非無性，由可言說自體不成就故，非有性；	006	That is to say, those things are neither existent nor nonexistent, because the essence that can be expressed is not accomplished, they are not existent;
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a18_17']	由不可言說自體成就故，非無性。	由不可言說自體成就故，非無性。	006	because the essence that cannot be expressed is accomplished, they are not nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a19_9']	如是非有色，猶勝義諦故；	如是非有色，猶勝義諦故；	006	In this way, they are not form, because of the ultimate truth;
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a20_3']	非無色，由世俗諦中假立色故。	非無色，由世俗諦中假立色故。	006	they are not formless, because form is established conventionally.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a22_1']	如有性無性、有色無色，如是有見無見等諸差別假立法門，彼一切由是理趣盡應知。	如有性無性、有色無色，如是有見無見等諸差別假立法門，彼一切由是理趣盡應知。	006	Just as with existence and nonexistence, form and formlessness, in the same way, all the other distinctions and established categories such as having form and formlessness, having perception and no perception, and so forth, should all be understood in this way.
['ZH_T31_1602_006:0508a23_15']	若能如實了知差別假立如是不二之義，是名第四差別假立尋思所引如實智。	若能如實了知差別假立如是不二之義，是名第四差別假立尋思所引如實智。	006	If one is able to understand the non-dual meaning of the establishment of distinctions in this way, this is called the knowledge of reality induced by the investigation of the establishment of distinctions, the fourth [investigation].
