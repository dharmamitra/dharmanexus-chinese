['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b09_6']	以邪心自高名慢。	以邪心自高名慢。	It is called pride when the mind is elevated through wrong views.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b11_4']	是慢多種，若於卑自高名慢，於等計等亦名為慢，以此中有取相我心過故。	是慢多種，若於卑自高名慢，於等計等亦名為慢，以此中有取相我心過故。	This pride has many kinds. If one is proud of oneself when inferior, it is called pride. Even considering oneself equal to equals is also called pride, because there is still the fault of the mind grasping at the self in this.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b12_16']	於等自高名為大慢，於勝自高是名慢慢，於五陰中取我相名為我慢。	於等自高名為大慢，於勝自高是名慢慢，於五陰中取我相名為我慢。	Being proud of oneself when equal is called great pride. Being proud of oneself when superior is called extreme pride. Taking the characteristics of self in the five aggregates is called pride in self.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b13_11']	我慢二種，示相、不示相。	我慢二種，示相、不示相。	Pride in self is of two kinds: showing characteristics and not showing characteristics.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b15_8']	示相是凡夫我慢，謂見色是我、見有色是我、見我中色、見色中我，乃至識亦如是。	示相是凡夫我慢，謂見色是我、見有色是我、見我中色、見色中我，乃至識亦如是。	Demonstrating characteristics is the arrogance of ordinary beings, referring to seeing form as the self, seeing the self as having form, seeing form in the self, seeing the self in form, up to consciousness being the same.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b15_19']	示是二十分，故名示相。	示是二十分，故名示相。	Demonstrating is the twenty aspects, therefore it is called demonstrating characteristics.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b16_16']	不示相是學人我慢，如長老差摩伽說：	不示相是學人我慢，如長老差摩伽說：	Not demonstrating characteristics is the arrogance of learners. As the elder Dharmagupta said:
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b18_18']	不說色是我、不說受想行識是我，但五陰中有我慢、我欲、我使未斷未盡，是名我慢。	不說色是我、不說受想行識是我，但五陰中有我慢、我欲、我使未斷未盡，是名我慢。	Not saying form is the self, not saying feeling, perception, mental formations, or consciousness are the self, but there is still the conceit of self, the desire for self, and the propensities of self that have not been eliminated or exhausted in the five aggregates, this is called the conceit of self.

['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b22_6']	於習禪中得少味故，能遮結使不行於心中，故生此慢。	於習禪中得少味故，能遮結使不行於心中，故生此慢。	Because one has attained a little taste in the practice of meditation, one is able to block the afflictions from arising in the mind, and therefore gives rise to this conceit.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b24_4']	又聞思慧力，常近善師、樂遠離行，少知五陰相，故生須陀洹等果想，名增上慢。	又聞思慧力，常近善師、樂遠離行，少知五陰相，故生須陀洹等果想，名增上慢。	Moreover, due to the power of hearing and contemplating wisdom, one always approaches good teachers and delights in the practice of detachment. Knowing a little about the characteristics of the five aggregates, one gives rise to the notion of attaining the fruits of stream-entry and so forth, which is called excessive pride.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b24_7']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b24_15']	增上慢有何等咎？	增上慢有何等咎？	What are the faults of excessive pride?

['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b28_5']	若是比丘實不得道，聞是法時則生悔惱，故應勤斷此增上慢。	若是比丘實不得道，聞是法時則生悔惱，故應勤斷此增上慢。	If this bhikkhu has truly not attained the path, when he hears this Dharma he will give rise to regret and distress. Therefore, one should diligently eliminate this excessive pride.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314b29_16']	又增上慢人，諸佛世尊有大慈悲，猶尚捨遠不為說法，是故應斷。	又增上慢人，諸佛世尊有大慈悲，猶尚捨遠不為說法，是故應斷。	Moreover, for a person with excessive pride, even the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, who have great compassion, will still abandon and distance themselves from him, not teaching him the Dharma. Therefore, one should eliminate it.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c02_8']	又增上慢人住邪法故，無實功德，猶如賈客深入大海而貪偽珠。	又增上慢人住邪法故，無實功德，猶如賈客深入大海而貪偽珠。	Furthermore, because a person with excessive pride abides in wrong teachings, he lacks true merits, just like a merchant who enters the great ocean and covets counterfeit jewels.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c03_14']	是人亦爾，入佛法海得少禪悅，謂為真道而生貪著。	是人亦爾，入佛法海得少禪悅，謂為真道而生貪著。	This person is also like this. Entering the ocean of the Buddha's teachings, obtaining a little joy from meditation, they take it to be the true path and give rise to attachment.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c05_2']	又增上慢人，後老死時不任受道，故當勤求真實智慧。	又增上慢人，後老死時不任受道，故當勤求真實智慧。	Moreover, a person with excessive pride is not fit to receive the Way when they are old and dying later on. Therefore, one should diligently seek true wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c06_8']	又增上慢人，自失己利亦增益愚癡，以實未得想謂得故。	又增上慢人，自失己利亦增益愚癡，以實未得想謂得故。	Furthermore, a person with excessive pride loses their own benefits and increases their foolishness, because they think they have attained what they have not truly attained.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c07_4']	是故不應自誑其身，當速棄捨。	是故不應自誑其身，當速棄捨。	Therefore, one should not deceive oneself and should quickly abandon [excessive pride].
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c08_2']	若於大勝人謂少不如，名不如慢。	若於大勝人謂少不如，名不如慢。	If one considers a greatly superior person to be slightly inferior, it is called excessive pride.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c09_14']	是人自高亦自下身，若人無德自高名為邪慢，又以惡法自高亦名邪慢。	是人自高亦自下身，若人無德自高名為邪慢，又以惡法自高亦名邪慢。	This person exalts themselves and also belittles themselves. If a person has no virtue and exalts themselves, it is called deviant pride. Moreover, extolling oneself with evil dharmas is also called deviant pride.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c10_14']	若於善人及所尊中不肯禮敬，名為傲慢。	若於善人及所尊中不肯禮敬，名為傲慢。	If one is unwilling to pay homage to good people and those to be respected, it is called arrogance.

['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c14_10']	若人以無常色自念是上是中是下，是人正以不知如實相故，乃至識亦如是。	若人以無常色自念是上是中是下，是人正以不知如實相故，乃至識亦如是。	If a person thinks of impermanent form as superior, middling, or inferior, this person is truly ignorant of the true characteristics, and so it is with consciousness.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c15_11']	若知陰相則無憍慢，又善修身念則無憍慢。	若知陰相則無憍慢，又善修身念則無憍慢。	If one knows the characteristics of the aggregates, then there is no arrogance. Moreover, if one skillfully cultivates mindfulness of the body, then there is no arrogance.
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c16_12']	如牛恃角則為暴慢，若去其角則不能也。	如牛恃角則為暴慢，若去其角則不能也。	Just as a cow relies on its horns and becomes arrogant, if its horns are removed, it cannot.

['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c22_9']	又智者知一切眾生，若貧若富若貴若賤，皆以骨肉筋脈五臟糞穢合而成身，俱有生老病死憂悲苦惱，亦有貪恚等諸煩惱罪福等諸業，及地獄等諸惡道分，云何當起憍慢？	又智者知一切眾生，若貧若富若貴若賤，皆以骨肉筋脈五臟糞穢合而成身，俱有生老病死憂悲苦惱，亦有貪恚等諸煩惱罪福等諸業，及地獄等諸惡道分，云何當起憍慢？	Moreover, the wise know that all sentient beings, whether poor or rich, noble or humble, are formed by combining bones, flesh, sinews, blood vessels, five viscera, and filth. They all have birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress. They also have greed, anger, and other afflictions, as well as the fruits of good and evil karma, and the parts of the evil destinies such as hell. How can one give rise to arrogance?

['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c25_8']	隨逐相故則憍慢生，若無相者何處起慢？	隨逐相故則憍慢生，若無相者何處起慢？	Because of following characteristics, arrogance arises. If there are no characteristics, where does arrogance arise?
['ZH_T32_1646_010:0314c26_7']	又智慧者，若實有戒等功德則不生慢。	又智慧者，若實有戒等功德則不生慢。	Moreover, the wise one, if there are truly precepts and other merits, then arrogance does not arise.
