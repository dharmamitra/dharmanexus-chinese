['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789a09_13']	若唯取此而為慧者，未修道品應非焰地。	若唯取此而為慧者，未修道品應非焰地。	037	If one only takes this as wisdom, then one who has not yet cultivated the factors of the path should not be the ground of flaming wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789a10_18']	以此地正明菩提分法，中該初後，諸論多依此釋。	以此地正明菩提分法，中該初後，諸論多依此釋。	037	Because this ground correctly clarifies the factors of enlightenment, encompassing the beginning and end, the various treatises often rely on this explanation.

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b04_1']	前中，論為四分：	前中，論為四分：	037	In the first, the treatise is divided into four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b05_13']	一清淨對治修行增長因分，謂清淨等是次二分，今趣地方便為彼之因；	一清淨對治修行增長因分，謂清淨等是次二分，今趣地方便為彼之因；	037	First, the cause of increasing the practice of pure counteraction, namely, purity, etc., are the next two parts, and now the expedient means for entering the ground are the cause of those;
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b06_18']	二「佛子菩薩住此焰慧」下清淨分，是初入地出障行故；	二「佛子菩薩住此焰慧」下清淨分，是初入地出障行故；	037	Second, The Buddha's disciple bodhisattvas abide in this flaming wisdom, below is the part of purity, because it is the practice of leaving hindrances upon first entering the ground;
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b09_9']	三「佛子菩薩住此第四」下對治修行增長分，即正住地行道品等行，能有所除故云對治，進習上上名修行增長；	三「佛子菩薩住此第四」下對治修行增長分，即正住地行道品等行，能有所除故云對治，進習上上名修行增長；	037	Third, from Buddha's disciple, the bodhisattva abiding in this fourth... is the section on the increase of counteracting practice. It refers to the practices of the stages of abiding, such as the factors of the path, which can eliminate things, thus called counteracting. Progressing in higher and higher [practices] is called the increase of practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b10_16']	四「佛子至所有身見」下彼果分，此即地滿，是中二分之果。	四「佛子至所有身見」下彼果分，此即地滿，是中二分之果。	037	Fourth, from Buddha's disciple, up to the views of self... is the section on the fruition of that [increase of practice]. This is the culmination of the stage, which is the fruition of the two sections in the middle.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b11_16']	又此四分，即加行、無間、解脫、勝進四道。	又此四分，即加行、無間、解脫、勝進四道。	037	Moreover, these four sections are the four paths of added effort, uninterrupted [path], liberation, and further progress.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b12_7']	又四中，初一入心、後三住心。	又四中，初一入心、後三住心。	037	Moreover, among the four, the first is the mind entering [samādhi], and the last three are the mind abiding [in samādhi].

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b14_17']	住心中三分攝前三位，初清淨分即攝生貴住、次攝至一切處迴向、後攝無盡行，至文當知。	住心中三分攝前三位，初清淨分即攝生貴住、次攝至一切處迴向、後攝無盡行，至文當知。	037	In the mind abiding [in samādhi], the three sections include the previous three stages. The first pure section includes the stage of abiding in the noble family, the next includes the up to the universal迴向, and the last includes the inexhaustible practices. This will be known in the text.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b15_6']	今初因分，文三：	今初因分，文三：	037	Now, the first is the section on causes. The text has three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b16_15']	初結前標後、次「何等」下徵列別名、三「菩薩以此」下結行入位。	初結前標後、次「何等」下徵列別名、三「菩薩以此」下結行入位。	037	First, summarizing the previous and introducing the next, next, below What are they? is the enumeration of the specific names, and third, below Bodhisattvas use these is the conclusion of the practice entering the stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b19_14']	今初，十法明門者，門即通入之義，故論經名入，明為能入之門，法為所入之處，故論云「得證地智光明，依彼智明入如來所說法中。	今初，十法明門者，門即通入之義，故論經名入，明為能入之門，法為所入之處，故論云「得證地智光明，依彼智明入如來所說法中。	037	Now, the first, the ten Dharma gates, the gate is the meaning of penetrating entry, therefore the treatise sūtra calls it entering. Illumination is the gate of the able to enter, the Dharma is the place of the entered. Therefore the treatise says: Obtaining the wisdom illumination of the stage of realization, relying on that wisdom illumination to enter the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b20_9']	」言證地智者，即四地證智也。	」言證地智者，即四地證智也。	037	As for the wisdom of realizing the stage, it is the wisdom of realization of the fourth stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b20_19']	光明者，即三地慧光。	光明者，即三地慧光。	037	As for illumination, it is the wisdom illumination of the third stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b22_14']	謂三地中得此四地證智前相，故併舉二處之智以釋於明，亦猶地前明得定也。	謂三地中得此四地證智前相，故併舉二處之智以釋於明，亦猶地前明得定也。	037	It means that in the third stage one obtains the prior signs of this wisdom of realization of the fourth stage, therefore the wisdom of both places is taken together to explain illumination, it is also like the illumination-attainment concentration of the stage prior to the grounds.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b23_15']	故前地論云彼慧，此中名光明，即其義也。	故前地論云彼慧，此中名光明，即其義也。	037	Therefore the treatise on the previous stage says that wisdom, in this it is called illumination, this is the meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b25_14']	言所說法者，前求多聞，從佛聞說眾生法界等十種之法，便以智光游入數數游入。	言所說法者，前求多聞，從佛聞說眾生法界等十種之法，便以智光游入數數游入。	037	As for the Dharma that is spoken, previously seeking much learning, from the Buddha hearing the explanation of the ten kinds of dharmas such as the Dharma realm of sentient beings, then using the light of wisdom to enter and repeatedly enter.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b27_8']	游入即是修行，修行即下觀察，觀察增上極圓滿故，方得證入四地。	游入即是修行，修行即下觀察，觀察增上極圓滿故，方得證入四地。	037	Entering is precisely cultivation, and cultivation is the observation below. Because observation increases and is extremely perfect, one can then realize and enter the fourth ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b27_19']	二徵列中，有十種差別。	二徵列中，有十種差別。	037	In the second, the ten kinds of distinctions are listed.

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b29_4']	一初句為總，本為眾生故；	一初句為總，本為眾生故；	037	First, the first sentence is the general, originally for the sake of sentient beings;
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789b29_15']	餘九為別，皆眾生事故。	餘九為別，皆眾生事故。	037	The remaining nine are the specific, all for the sake of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c01_7']	二前八為染，後二為淨。	二前八為染，後二為淨。	037	Second, the first eight are defiled, and the last two are pure.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c02_7']	三前五推能依至所依，後五依所依立能依。	三前五推能依至所依，後五依所依立能依。	037	Third, the first five push the dependent to the basis, and the last five establish the dependent based on the basis.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c03_1']	前中，一觀眾生假名差別。	前中，一觀眾生假名差別。	037	Among them, the first is observing the distinctions in the false names of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c03_6']	假有三種：	假有三種：	037	False names have three kinds:
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c04_1']	一因成假、二相續假、三相待假。	一因成假、二相續假、三相待假。	037	First, the false name of cause formation, second, the false name of continuity, and third, the false name of mutual dependence.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c04_11']	假為空詮，故先觀之。	假為空詮，故先觀之。	037	False names are the explanation of emptiness, so one observes them first.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c04_16']	因成有二：	因成有二：	037	There are two kinds of causes:
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c05_13']	一五蘊和合，假名某甲，則入眾生空。	一五蘊和合，假名某甲，則入眾生空。	037	First, the combination of the five aggregates is provisionally named a certain person, which enters the emptiness of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c06_7']	二陰亦因緣而有，則入法空。	二陰亦因緣而有，則入法空。	037	Second, the aggregates also exist due to causes and conditions, which enters the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c07_12']	二空所顯即是真如，不壞假名、空有不二，即是中道。	二空所顯即是真如，不壞假名、空有不二，即是中道。	037	The two emptinesses reveal true suchness, which is not destroyed. The provisional name, emptiness and existence, are non-dual, which is the middle way.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c08_16']	言相續者，由前陰滅後陰續生，念念相續，假而非實。	言相續者，由前陰滅後陰續生，念念相續，假而非實。	037	As for continuity, the previous aggregates cease and the subsequent aggregates continue to arise, moment by moment, continuously, provisionally, not truly existent.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c09_4']	亦入二空真實。	亦入二空真實。	037	It also enters the two emptinesses and reality.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c10_4']	言相待者，待非眾生以說眾生，入實亦然。	言相待者，待非眾生以說眾生，入實亦然。	037	As for mutual dependence, depending on non-sentient beings to speak of sentient beings, entering reality is also like this.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c11_6']	此一推假入實，餘九例知，故論但顯差別之相。	此一推假入實，餘九例知，故論但顯差別之相。	037	This one investigation of the provisional entering the real, the other nine are to be understood as examples, therefore the treatise only reveals the characteristics of differences.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c12_13']	二法界者，論當第三，是依正之因，即染法界，此從別義。	二法界者，論當第三，是依正之因，即染法界，此從別義。	037	As for the second, the dharma realm, the treatise corresponds to the third, which is the cause of the dependent and the correct, namely the defiled dharma realm, this is from a specific meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c13_13']	若淨法界，通為十依，則十與法界究竟無別。	若淨法界，通為十依，則十與法界究竟無別。	037	If it is the pure dharma realm, it universally serves as the basis for the ten, then the ten and the dharma realm are ultimately no different.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c14_9']	三世界者，彼假名眾生所住依報。	三世界者，彼假名眾生所住依報。	037	The third realm refers to the dependent environment in which those sentient beings provisionally named reside.

The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra calls it the supreme truth of equality, because it is the principle of emptiness that is inexhaustible.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c18_5']	五染淨所依是本識界，後五依此所依立後能依，故此識界前後兩向，向前為依正依，向後為染淨依。	五染淨所依是本識界，後五依此所依立後能依，故此識界前後兩向，向前為依正依，向後為染淨依。	037	The fifth realm is the store consciousness, which is the support of the defiled and the pure. The last five realms are established on the basis of this support, and therefore this consciousness is the support of the dependent and the independent in the two directions of past and future.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0789c20_4']	初三句，由煩惱使染成染分依他，有三界差別，著欲、著受及著想故，三界唯心故。	初三句，由煩惱使染成染分依他，有三界差別，著欲、著受及著想故，三界唯心故。	037	The first three phrases are the defiled part of the dependent on the basis of the defilement of the passions, and there are distinctions among the three realms, because of attachment to desire, attachment to feeling, and attachment to conceptualization. The three realms are only mind.

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0791c23_7']	《智論》云「尋隨觀察知其不淨」等。	《智論》云「尋隨觀察知其不淨」等。	037	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says: Investigating, following, and observing know it to be impure and so forth.

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0791c24_6']	一尋義，五種不淨遍尋求故。	一尋義，五種不淨遍尋求故。	037	First, investigating the meaning, because one thoroughly seeks the five kinds of impurity.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0791c25_12']	二隨義，謂雖冥目，了見身之影像，隨順本質相似性故。	二隨義，謂雖冥目，了見身之影像，隨順本質相似性故。	037	Second, following the meaning, which means that although one is blind, one clearly sees the image of the body, because it conforms to the nature of similarity with the original object.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0791c26_19']	前標內身即是本質，今云循身即是影像，此《雜集》意。	前標內身即是本質，今云循身即是影像，此《雜集》意。	037	The previous statement of the internal body is the original object, and now saying following the body is the image. This is the meaning of the Saṃyuktâbhidharmahṛdaya.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0791c27_9']	次勤勇念知，顯修之儀。	次勤勇念知，顯修之儀。	037	Next, diligently and attentively knowing, shows the manner of cultivation.

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0792a01_15']	勤即欲勤策勵，勇謂勇猛不息，念則明記不忘，知則決斷無悔。	勤即欲勤策勵，勇謂勇猛不息，念則明記不忘，知則決斷無悔。	037	Diligence is the desire, effort, and exertion, while courage means being vigorous and not stopping. Mindfulness is clearly remembering without forgetting, while knowing is decisively without regret.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0792a03_8']	又心若馳散，當念老病死苦、三惡道苦、身命無常、佛法欲滅，名為念知。	又心若馳散，當念老病死苦、三惡道苦、身命無常、佛法欲滅，名為念知。	037	Moreover, if the mind wanders, one should be mindful of the suffering of old age, sickness, death, and the three evil destinies, and the impermanence of the body and life, and the imminent extinction of the Buddha's teachings, which is called mindfulness and knowing.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0792a04_13']	則能鞭心令復本觀，便生勤勇，具上諸義則不放逸。	則能鞭心令復本觀，便生勤勇，具上諸義則不放逸。	037	Then one can whip the mind to return to the original contemplation, and give rise to diligence. Being endowed with the above meanings is non-negligence.

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0792a07_4']	觀身不淨本為治貪行者，既離五欲世樂，未得定樂，或時生憂。	觀身不淨本為治貪行者，既離五欲世樂，未得定樂，或時生憂。	037	Contemplating the body as impure is originally to cure greed. The practitioner, having already abandoned the five desires and worldly pleasures, has not yet attained the bliss of concentration, and may sometimes give rise to sorrow.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0792a08_1']	如魚樂水，常求樂事，還念本欲。	如魚樂水，常求樂事，還念本欲。	037	Just as a fish enjoys water and always seeks pleasurable things, it still thinks of its original desires.

['ZH_T35_1735_037:0792a11_3']	憂於五受之中偏能障定，如滅惡賊先除巨害，故偏說之。	憂於五受之中偏能障定，如滅惡賊先除巨害，故偏說之。	037	Sorrow, among the five feelings, is especially able to obstruct concentration. Like destroying a vicious thief, one first removes the great harm, so it is specifically mentioned.
['ZH_T35_1735_037:0792a11_13']	其不淨等，廣如二論。	其不淨等，廣如二論。	037	The characteristics of impurity, etc., are extensively discussed in the two treatises.
