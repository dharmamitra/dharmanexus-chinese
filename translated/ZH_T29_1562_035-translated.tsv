['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c08_17']	3 三辨業品第四之三如是已辨二表業相，無表業相初品已辨。	3 三辨業品第四之三如是已辨二表業相，無表業相初品已辨。	035	Chapter 3, part 4: Distinguishing karma, fourth of three parts. Thus far, the characteristics of the two manifest karmas have been discussed. The characteristics of unmanifest karma were discussed in the first chapter.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c09_4']	然經部言：	然經部言：	035	However, the Sautrāntika say:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c11_8']	此亦非實，由先誓限唯不作故，彼亦依過去大種施設，然過去大種體非有故，又諸無表無色相故。	此亦非實，由先誓限唯不作故，彼亦依過去大種施設，然過去大種體非有故，又諸無表無色相故。	035	This is also not real, because it is only the vow not to do [evil] that is made. They also establish it based on past primary elements, but since the substance of past primary elements does not exist, and also because all unmanifest karma is without form,
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c11_18']	如是諸因，皆不應理。	如是諸因，皆不應理。	035	these reasons are all unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c12_18']	且非唯不作即名無表業，以無表業待勝緣故。	且非唯不作即名無表業，以無表業待勝緣故。	035	Moreover, it is not that only non-doing is called unmanifest karma, because unmanifest karma depends on superior conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c13_17']	謂唯不作，於立誓先與立誓後無差別故。	謂唯不作，於立誓先與立誓後無差別故。	035	That is to say, only non-doing is not distinguished from before making the vow and after making the vow.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c14_17']	未立誓位，不作已成，復立誓限便為無用。	未立誓位，不作已成，復立誓限便為無用。	035	In the state before making the vow, non-doing has already been accomplished. Making the vow again would be useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c16_5']	若謂不作要待勝緣方可得成律儀性者，是則應許有別法生。	若謂不作要待勝緣方可得成律儀性者，是則應許有別法生。	035	If you say that it is not made and that it can only be accomplished by relying on superior conditions, then you must admit that there is a separate dharma that arises.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c17_5']	現見世間待勝緣合，必有有體別法生故。	現見世間待勝緣合，必有有體別法生故。	035	Because it is seen in the world that when superior conditions come together, there must be the arising of a separate dharma with an existent nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c18_6']	若謂立誓故得阿世耶，應責阿世耶名何所目？	若謂立誓故得阿世耶，應責阿世耶名何所目？	035	If you say that one obtains the nature of the precepts by making a vow, then you should be asked what the term “intention” refers to.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c18_18']	謂心心所法，如是差別轉。	謂心心所法，如是差別轉。	035	It refers to the transformation of the mind and mental factors in such a way.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c19_19']	若爾，此息位便失律儀，則應須數數重立誓受。	若爾，此息位便失律儀，則應須數數重立誓受。	035	If that is so, then this state would lose the precepts, and one would have to repeatedly make vows and receive them again and again.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c22_1']	若謂如是不作阿世耶，於一切時恒無息故者，彼言實爾，此體都無，無法無容有起息故。	若謂如是不作阿世耶，於一切時恒無息故者，彼言實爾，此體都無，無法無容有起息故。	035	If you say that this is because the intention not to commit [evil] is always present without interruption at all times, then that statement is indeed true, but this nature does not exist at all, because it is impossible for a non-existent dharma to have an interruption.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c23_3']	又獨靜處立誓要期，如此阿世耶，何非律儀性？	又獨靜處立誓要期，如此阿世耶，何非律儀性？	035	Moreover, making a vow in a solitary place, is this kind of intention not the nature of the precepts?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c25_19']	既許此性必待勝緣，故知定應有勝法起，謂必應有殊勝法性，待如是緣和合方起，非都無有殊勝法性，因廣大教加行方得。	既許此性必待勝緣，故知定應有勝法起，謂必應有殊勝法性，待如是緣和合方起，非都無有殊勝法性，因廣大教加行方得。	035	Since it is admitted that this nature must await superior conditions, we know that there must be the arising of superior dharmas, that is, there must be a superior dharma nature that arises only when such conditions are combined, and it is not that there is absolutely no superior dharma nature that is obtained only through extensive teachings and practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0539c27_9']	若異此者，是則應同諸婆羅門及離繫者，矯設大方便而空無所得。	若異此者，是則應同諸婆羅門及離繫者，矯設大方便而空無所得。	035	If it were otherwise, then it would be the same as the Brahmins and Jains, who set up great expedients in vain without obtaining anything.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a01_3']	若謂如是立誓要期，要對眾前自顯心願，如證悔法方得成者，不服法衣、不落鬚髮、不持應器，但對眾前立誓要期：	若謂如是立誓要期，要對眾前自顯心願，如證悔法方得成者，不服法衣、不落鬚髮、不持應器，但對眾前立誓要期：	035	If it is said that such a vow must be made in front of the assembly, revealing one's mental aspirations, and can only be accomplished through the method of repentance, then one who does not wear the Dharma robes, does not shave their beard and hair, does not carry the proper alms bowl, but only makes a vow in front of the assembly,🔽saying:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a01_17']	從今已去，我定不作如是諸惡。	從今已去，我定不作如是諸惡。	035	From now on, I will definitely not commit such evil deeds.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a02_7']	應名出家受具戒者。	應名出家受具戒者。	035	Should be called one who has left the household life and received the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a03_15']	又世現見彼彼有情，種種施為殊勝加行，便有種種異類法生。	又世現見彼彼有情，種種施為殊勝加行，便有種種異類法生。	035	Moreover, the world presently sees that various sentient beings, through various superior practices, give rise to various different kinds of dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a05_13']	既見出家受具戒者，施為種種殊勝加行，比知必定有勝法生，此於我宗名無表業。	既見出家受具戒者，施為種種殊勝加行，比知必定有勝法生，此於我宗名無表業。	035	When we see that those who have gone forth and received the precepts perform various superior practices, we infer that there must definitely be a superior dharma that arises. This is what we call avijñapti in our school.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a07_3']	縱汝立此名阿世耶，異心無心恒隨相續，此名於理亦無有過。	縱汝立此名阿世耶，異心無心恒隨相續，此名於理亦無有過。	035	Even if you establish this name āśaya, with a different mind or no mind, it always follows the continuum. This name is also faultless in principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a08_2']	若全無物而立此名，則成第四業道重罪。	若全無物而立此名，則成第四業道重罪。	035	If there is absolutely nothing and this name is established, then it becomes the fourth grave offense of the path of action.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a08_7']	又彼所言：	又彼所言：	035	Moreover, what they say:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a08_17']	彼亦依過去大種施設。	彼亦依過去大種施設。	035	That is also established based on past primary elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a10_10']	然過去大種體非有者，理亦不然，應共思擇，過去法體為有為無方可難故。	然過去大種體非有者，理亦不然，應共思擇，過去法體為有為無方可難故。	035	However, it is also unreasonable to say that the substance of past primary elements does not exist, because one should investigate whether past dharmas exist or not before one can object.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a11_10']	又過去世地等大種能為生緣，非所許故。	又過去世地等大種能為生緣，非所許故。	035	Moreover, the past world's primary elements of earth, etc. can be the condition for arising, because they are not accepted.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a12_18']	彼曾現在與無表色能為生緣，今雖過去所生無表，續轉無失。	彼曾現在與無表色能為生緣，今雖過去所生無表，續轉無失。	035	They were once present and could be the condition for arising for non-indicative form. Now, although they are past, there is no error in the continuity and transformation of the non-indicative form that is produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a14_6']	又言無表無色相者，理亦不然，前已說故，謂初品內已辨斯理。	又言無表無色相者，理亦不然，前已說故，謂初品內已辨斯理。	035	Also, the statement that unmanifest action has no form is unreasonable, because it has already been explained previously, that is, in the first chapter.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a15_15']	無色法中無此相故，彼約變壞及表示等諸相差別，釋總色名。	無色法中無此相故，彼約變壞及表示等諸相差別，釋總色名。	035	Because there is no such characteristic among formless dharmas, the general name of form is explained on the basis of such characteristics as transformation and manifestation.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a17_4']	無色法中無此相故，雖非此義遍一切色，而成無過訓釋色詞。	無色法中無此相故，雖非此義遍一切色，而成無過訓釋色詞。	035	Because there is no such characteristic among formless dharmas, although this is not the meaning of form in all cases, there is no error in explaining the term form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a18_3']	或應識中亦有此失，以非諸識皆了別故。	或應識中亦有此失，以非諸識皆了別故。	035	Or, there would be the same error in the case of consciousness, because not all consciousnesses are conscious of objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a18_13']	彼既無過，此寧有失？	彼既無過，此寧有失？	035	Since there is no error in the case of form, why is there an error in the case of consciousness?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a19_2']	又釋諸色略有三義：	又釋諸色略有三義：	035	Also, form is explained in three ways:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a20_3']	一示現方處義、二觸對變壞義、三約色施設義。	一示現方處義、二觸對變壞義、三約色施設義。	035	1) the meaning of manifesting place, 2) the meaning of being touched and transformed, and 3) the meaning of being established in terms of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a21_2']	謂有見色，可示在此、在彼方所，故名為色。	謂有見色，可示在此、在彼方所，故名為色。	035	That is, visible form can be shown to be in this place or that place, and therefore it is called form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a22_1']	諸有對色，可為手等觸對變壞，故名為色。	諸有對色，可為手等觸對變壞，故名為色。	035	All forms that are resistant can be touched and transformed by the hand and other objects, and therefore they are called form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a22_18']	諸無見無對色，約色施設，故名為色；	諸無見無對色，約色施設，故名為色；	035	The various unmanifest forms that are neither visible nor resistant are established in terms of form, and are therefore called form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a23_17']	非離身語此可施設，以無色界中此施設無故。	非離身語此可施設，以無色界中此施設無故。	035	This cannot be established apart from body and speech, because this establishment does not exist in the formless realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a24_19']	或如過去未來諸色，雖無變壞等，而亦受色名。	或如過去未來諸色，雖無變壞等，而亦受色名。	035	Or, just as past and future forms, although without change and destruction, are still called form,
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a25_9']	此亦應然，故彼非難。	此亦應然，故彼非難。	035	this should be the same. Therefore, this is not a problem.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a26_3']	又定應許諸無表色是實有性。	又定應許諸無表色是實有性。	035	Moreover, one must definitely admit that all unmanifest forms are real entities.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a26_8']	所以者何？	所以者何？	035	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a26_11']	頌曰：	頌曰：	035	The verse states:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a27_13']	說三無漏色，　　增非作等故。	說三無漏色，　　增非作等故。	035	It is said that the three kinds of pure form are increased, not created, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a28_2']	論曰：	論曰：	035	The treatise states:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540a28_12']	以契經說，色有三種。	以契經說，色有三種。	035	Because a scripture states that form is of three kinds.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b01_8']	此三為處，攝一切色，一者有色有見有對、二者有色無見有對、三者有色無見無對。	此三為處，攝一切色，一者有色有見有對、二者有色無見有對、三者有色無見無對。	035	These three serve as categories, encompassing all forms: the first is form that is visible and resistant, the second is form that is invisible but resistant, and the third is form that is invisible and non-resistant.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b02_9']	除無表色，更復說何為此中第三無見無對色？	除無表色，更復說何為此中第三無見無對色？	035	Apart from unmanifest form, what else could be said to be the third kind of form that is invisible and non-resistant in this context?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b03_9']	此中上座率自妄情，改換正文，作如是誦：	此中上座率自妄情，改換正文，作如是誦：	035	Here, the elder [Vasubandhu] follows his own false thoughts, alters the correct text, and recites like this:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b04_13']	一者有色無見有對，謂一觸處，非所見故，是所觸故。	一者有色無見有對，謂一觸處，非所見故，是所觸故。	035	First, there is form that is invisible and has resistance, which refers to the one tangible object, because it is not seen but is tangible.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b05_18']	二者有色有見無對，謂一色處，是所見故，非所觸故。	二者有色有見無對，謂一色處，是所見故，非所觸故。	035	Second, there is form that is visible and has resistance, which refers to the one visible object, because it is visible but not tangible.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b07_10']	三者有色無見無對，謂餘八處，非所見故，非所觸故，定無有色有見有對。	三者有色無見無對，謂餘八處，非所見故，非所觸故，定無有色有見有對。	035	Third, there is form that is invisible and has no resistance, which refers to the remaining eight sense bases, because they are neither visible nor tangible. It is definitely impossible for there to be form that is visible and has resistance.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b08_17']	如是誦釋，若有信受或有正理，可許引來遮破我宗所立無表。	如是誦釋，若有信受或有正理，可許引來遮破我宗所立無表。	035	If there is faith and acceptance of this recitation and explanation, or if there is right reasoning, one may allow it to be brought up to refute our school's establishment of non-manifest form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b10_7']	然彼誦釋不離前來所說過故，曾無餘經作此誦故，誰能信受？	然彼誦釋不離前來所說過故，曾無餘經作此誦故，誰能信受？	035	However, because this recitation and explanation do not avoid the previously mentioned faults, and because there has never been any other sūtra that recites like this, who can believe and accept it?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b10_12']	彼作是說：	彼作是說：	035	They say:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b11_14']	經部諸師所誦經中曾見有此，諸對法者應專信學。	經部諸師所誦經中曾見有此，諸對法者應專信學。	035	In the sūtras recited by the Sautrāntika masters, this has been seen. The Abhidharma masters should study and believe in it exclusively.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b13_5']	對法諸師由愛無表，令心倒亂，謬誦此經，故非無經作如是誦。	對法諸師由愛無表，令心倒亂，謬誦此經，故非無經作如是誦。	035	The masters of the Abhidharma, out of love for the avijñapti, let their minds go astray and mistakenly recite this sūtra. Therefore, there is no sūtra that recites it in this way.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b16_2']	阿毘達磨諸大論師，實謂奇哉懷賢泛愛，如斯𢤱戾越路而行、一類自稱經為量者，猶能眷攝為內法人，時與評論甚深理教。	阿毘達磨諸大論師，實謂奇哉懷賢泛愛，如斯𢤱戾越路而行、一類自稱經為量者，猶能眷攝為內法人，時與評論甚深理教。	035	The great masters of the Abhidharma, in fact, think it strange that the Ābhidhārmikas, who love the wise so much, would travel such a long distance to go against the scriptures. Those who claim the scriptures as their authority are still able to include them as insiders and discuss the profound teachings with them.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b17_19']	然彼所誦，於諸部中所有聖言曾不見有，所釋義理違背餘經，寧勸智人令專信學？	然彼所誦，於諸部中所有聖言曾不見有，所釋義理違背餘經，寧勸智人令專信學？	035	However, what they recite is not found in any of the scriptures of the Āgamas. The meaning and principles they explain contradict other sūtras. How can they encourage wise people to study and believe in them exclusively?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b18_17']	愛無表色正合其儀，佛於經中自攝受故。	愛無表色正合其儀，佛於經中自攝受故。	035	The avijñapti that they love is in accord with their principles, because the Buddha himself accepts it in the sūtras.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b19_16']	謂象迹喻契經中說有法處色，故彼經言：	謂象迹喻契經中說有法處色，故彼經言：	035	This is because the Elephant's Footprint Simile Sūtra speaks of the form of the dharma realm. The sūtra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b19_19']	具壽！	具壽！	035	Venerable One!
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b21_6']	此中有諸色法，唯意識境，體是色蘊，法處所攝，無見無對。	此中有諸色法，唯意識境，體是色蘊，法處所攝，無見無對。	035	Herein, there are forms that are only the objects of mental consciousness. They are the form aggregate, included in the dharma realm, invisible, and unimpeded.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b22_4']	若離無表，更有何色說是色蘊法處攝耶？	若離無表，更有何色說是色蘊法處攝耶？	035	If you do not admit the existence of avijñapti, what other kind of form is included in the aggregate of form and the sense base of form?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b22_13']	何不許斯是去來色？	何不許斯是去來色？	035	Why do you not admit that past and future form exist?
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b23_14']	應十處色不通三世，許眼等去來皆法處攝故。	應十處色不通三世，許眼等去來皆法處攝故。	035	You would have to admit that the ten sense bases of form do not exist in the three periods of time, because you admit that past and future eyes, etc., are all included in the sense base of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b25_14']	又應違背各別處經，法謂外處，是十一處所不攝法，無見無對，此經遮眼等是法處攝故。	又應違背各別處經，法謂外處，是十一處所不攝法，無見無對，此經遮眼等是法處攝故。	035	You would also contradict the scripture that says that each sense base has its own specific object, because the sense base of form is the object of the eye, and this scripture says that form is not included in the sense base of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b27_3']	又彼過去未來眼等，隨應體是有見有對，由此不應是法處攝。	又彼過去未來眼等，隨應體是有見有對，由此不應是法處攝。	035	Also, past and future eyes, etc., would have to be visible and resistant, and for that reason not included in the sense base of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b28_10']	又彼勿許過去未來眼等是色，以於爾時無變壞等諸色相故。	又彼勿許過去未來眼等是色，以於爾時無變壞等諸色相故。	035	Also, you should not admit that past and future eyes, etc., are form, because at those times they do not have the characteristics of form, such as resistance.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540b29_10']	是則前難及釋此經自互相違，非為善說。	是則前難及釋此經自互相違，非為善說。	035	This means that the previous objection and the interpretation of the scripture contradict each other and are not well taken.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540c01_19']	又法處色決定應有，各別處經說外法處，非如意處說無色故。	又法處色決定應有，各別處經說外法處，非如意處說無色故。	035	Also, form included in the sense base of form must definitely exist, because a scripture says that the external sense base of form is not like the sense base of thought, which is said not to have form.
['ZH_T29_1562_035:0540c03_8']	以法處中決定有色，不說無色，深為應理，辨本事品已廣分別。	以法處中決定有色，不說無色，深為應理，辨本事品已廣分別。	035	It is reasonable to say that there is form in the dharma realm, but not to say that there is no form. This has been extensively distinguished in the chapter on the main points.
