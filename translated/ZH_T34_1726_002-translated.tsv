Such meanings are fully explained in the Great Treatise.

These causes and conditions are emptiness, conventionality, and the Middle Way. Emptiness is true suchness, conventionality is the mundane truth, and the Middle Way is the supreme truth of the Middle Way.

The Large Sutra and the Garland Sutra directly discuss the Mahayana and only clarify the three contemplations and three knowledges. If we now open the two sutras and combine the Nirvana Sutra, we should open the derived dharma of entering emptiness from the provisional, which is the knowledge of arising and ceasing of all knowledge.

It is not only arising from arising that can be spoken of, up to non-arising from non-arising can also be spoken of, because the Buddha's teachings lead one out of the suffering of birth and death.

Each extensively clarifies the Dharma of practice and distinguishes the stages of sages, as the gates lead to the principle.
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0887c17_4']	通教四門者，謂如幻之有、如幻之空、亦空亦有、非空非有，一一作行相判賢聖位，由門通理。	通教四門者，謂如幻之有、如幻之空、亦空亦有、非空非有，一一作行相判賢聖位，由門通理。	002	The four gates of the Shared Teaching refer to illusory existence, illusory emptiness, both emptiness and existence, and neither emptiness nor existence. Each is used to distinguish the characteristics of practice and distinguish the stages of sages, as the gates lead to the principle.
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0887c18_2']	別教四門，觀佛性如闇室瓶盆即有門；	別教四門，觀佛性如闇室瓶盆即有門；	002	The four gates of the Distinct Teaching observe Buddha-nature as if in a dark room with vases and basins, which is the gate of existence;
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0887c18_16']	觀佛性如空迦毘羅城空即無門；	觀佛性如空迦毘羅城空即無門；	002	observing Buddha-nature as empty like the empty city of Kapilavastu is the gate of nonexistence;
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0887c20_2']	觀佛性如石中金，福人得寶、罪人見石，是亦有亦無門；	觀佛性如石中金，福人得寶、罪人見石，是亦有亦無門；	002	observing Buddha-nature as gold in a stone, where the fortunate see it as a treasure and the sinful see it as a stone, is the gate of both existence and nonexistence;
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0887c20_19']	觀佛性離二邊，即中道，非有非無門。	觀佛性離二邊，即中道，非有非無門。	002	observing Buddha-nature as transcending the two extremes is the middle way, the gate of neither existence nor nonexistence.

They are neither one nor four, without the distinction of gradual progression. The perfect and harmonious four of the four is the inconceivable characteristics of practice and stages in each and every case. The meaning of the gates penetrating the principle is all in the Great Canon.

If the gates of views, attachments, and so forth of ordinary beings and non-Buddhists cannot even penetrate out of the three realms, how much less can they be universal?
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a01_2']	三藏通教雖通化城，亦復非普；	三藏通教雖通化城，亦復非普；	002	Although the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings penetrate the provisional city, they are also not universal;

['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a03_15']	唯圓教教觀實相法門能遍十法界，千性相三諦一時圓通，圓通中道，雙照二諦，獨稱為普門也。	唯圓教教觀實相法門能遍十法界，千性相三諦一時圓通，圓通中道，雙照二諦，獨稱為普門也。	002	Only the perfect teaching's Dharma gate of contemplating the true aspect can pervade the ten dharma realms, with the three truths of a thousand natures and characteristics simultaneously perfectly penetrating. The perfect penetration of the middle way illuminates the two truths, and is uniquely called the Universal Gate.
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a05_16']	復次，如《淨名》中說入不二門者，生死、涅槃為二，不依生死、不依涅槃，名為不二，亦復非一。	復次，如《淨名》中說入不二門者，生死、涅槃為二，不依生死、不依涅槃，名為不二，亦復非一。	002	Furthermore, as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra says, entering the gate of non-duality means that birth and death and nirvāṇa are two. Not relying on birth and death, not relying on nirvāṇa, is called non-duality, and it is also not one.
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a05_20']	何以故？	何以故？	002	Why is this?
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a07_3']	既除於二，若復在一，一對不一，還復成二，豈名不二耶？	既除於二，若復在一，一對不一，還復成二，豈名不二耶？	002	If, having eliminated the two, one still remains in one, one against not one, it again becomes two. How can it be called non-dual?
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a09_19']	今不在二，故言不一、不二，亦名不有、不無，不有是破假、不無是破空，不有是破二、不無是破一，若爾者，應存中道，中道亦空。	今不在二，故言不一、不二，亦名不有、不無，不有是破假、不無是破空，不有是破二、不無是破一，若爾者，應存中道，中道亦空。	002	Now, not being in the two, it is said to be neither one nor two. It is also called neither existent nor non-existent. Not existent breaks through the provisional, not non-existent breaks through emptiness. Not existent breaks through two, not non-existent breaks through one. If so, then the middle way should be preserved, and the middle way is also empty.
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a10_13']	《大經》云「明與無明，其性不二。	《大經》云「明與無明，其性不二。	002	The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, Illumination and ignorance, their natures are non-dual.

Since the middle way is empty of the two extremes, this emptiness is also empty, thus it is called emptiness of emptiness. Emptiness refers to the emptiness of the unobtainable. This is entering the non-dual Dharma door, which is precisely the meaning of the perfect teaching using the emptiness gate to explain the universal gate.
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888a15_11']	三十一菩薩各說不二門、文殊說無說為不二門、淨名杜口為不二門，細尋彼文皆有四門義。	三十一菩薩各說不二門、文殊說無說為不二門、淨名杜口為不二門，細尋彼文皆有四門義。	002	The thirty-one bodhisattvas each speak of the non-dual gate. Mañjuśrī speaks of non-utterance as the non-dual gate. Vimalakīrti's silence is the non-dual gate. Carefully examining those texts, they all have the meaning of the four gates.

These ten universal gates are all discussed in terms of the adornment of merit and virtue in practice. The first five chapters are one's own practice, the next three chapters are benefiting others, and the last two chapters conclude the previous two meanings.

Although this mind is not itself the bodhi mind, it can give rise to the bodhi mind. It is like how earth and water, although not seeds themselves, can cause sprouts to grow. Now, giving rise to the bodhi mind due to great compassion is also like this.

If one only gives rise to vows, it will not benefit others, just as without wealth, power, and strategy, one cannot rescue from difficulties. Bodhisattvas are also like this. They need the wealth of merit and virtue, the power of spiritual penetrations, and the strategy of wisdom in order to transform and guide.

['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888b18_5']	以方便道伏、無礙道斷、解脫道證，引《釋論》云「無礙道中行名菩薩，解脫道中行名佛。	以方便道伏、無礙道斷、解脫道證，引《釋論》云「無礙道中行名菩薩，解脫道中行名佛。	002	Using the path of skillful means to subdue, using the path of unobstructedness to sever, and using the path of liberation to realize. Quoting the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, it says The practice in the path of unobstructedness is called a bodhisattva, and the practice in the path of liberation is called a buddha.

This is the sequence of one's own practice.
['ZH_T34_1726_002:0888b23_4']	次神通者，若欲化他，示三密神通是示色身方便，示意同情說法是示口隨其類音，此是化他次第也。	次神通者，若欲化他，示三密神通是示色身方便，示意同情說法是示口隨其類音，此是化他次第也。	002	Next, regarding spiritual powers, if one wishes to transform others, manifesting the three mysteries and spiritual powers is manifesting the expedient means of the physical body, and manifesting the mind in accord with speaking the Dharma is manifesting the mouth in accordance with their various sounds. This is the sequence of transforming others.

Although there is no object, it can illuminate both emptiness and conventionality. Compassion arises based on this, called unconditioned compassion.
