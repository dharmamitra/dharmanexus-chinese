Those who understand the path consider speaking and silence to be one way, while those who are confused about the purport consider principle and phenomena to be completely separate. Therefore, Śāriputra, due to the burden of high and low, sees hills and mounds when looking at the ground. Brahmā, due to the complete absence of self and other, sees precious gravel when looking at stony fields. This means that the purity of the pure land opens the gate of extreme bliss due to the pure aspiration, while the impurity of the defiled realm arises from the dust of the defiled mind and creates the realm of pure suffering. It is precisely because beings have the intention to accept or reject that they can delight in the suspended drum, and people compete in right and wrong, rejecting the mixed bag that can be disliked. Therefore, those who earnestly cultivate the ten recitations will ascend to the sun palace, and those who deeply revere the three practices will soon ascend to the lotus seat.

However, it can subdue afflictions and prevent them from arising. For example, when a person single-mindedly contemplates the Buddha, the mental ground will no longer give rise to greed, anger, jealousy, or wrong views.

It means that one who shows the tongue reaching the nose will never speak falsely, let alone one who covers the three thousand worlds without being real.
['ZH_T37_1757_001:0327a02_1']	然如來為證小事但舒舌覆面或至髮際，若證大事即舒舌覆大千。	然如來為證小事但舒舌覆面或至髮際，若證大事即舒舌覆大千。	001	However, when the Tathāgata testifies to a minor matter, he only shows his tongue covering his face or reaching the hairline. If he testifies to a major matter, he shows his tongue covering the great trichiliocosm.

What is not measured by the mind is called inconceivable, and what is not reached by speech is called indescribable.

Although the virtues of all teachings are numerous, they are difficult to compare with the virtues of this sutra. Therefore, it causes the Buddhas of the Ganges sands to uphold it without extinction, and to keep it in mind. Therefore, it is said to be the sutra praised by the inconceivable merits of all Buddhas and protected by all Buddhas.
