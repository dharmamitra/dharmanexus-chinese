['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582b26_11']	二華名，謂以香摩尼嚴此華故，又從摩尼底而出生故。	二華名，謂以香摩尼嚴此華故，又從摩尼底而出生故。	Second, the name of the flower. It is said that this flower is adorned with fragrant maṇi jewels, and it is also born from the bottom of the maṇi jewel.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582b27_5', 'ZH_T35_1735_012:0582b27_15']	約法即萬行圓明之所成故。🔽海能有華，故受華名；	約法即萬行圓明之所成故。 海能有華，故受華名；	In terms of the Dharma, it is because it is accomplished by the perfect illumination of myriad practices.🔽The ocean is able to have flowers, so it receives the name of flowers;

If this name is based on the lotus flower that supports the great trichiliocosm, the old commentary says that above the boundless fragrant ocean there is this lotus flower that supports this single world system, taking this as an analogy for the separate basis of support for the upper layers, thus this explanation is given. How can it be that the lowest one is based on the general lotus flower? Think about it.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c14_15']	四形如摩尼者，為摩尼狀有於八楞，似方不方、似圓不圓，故異下八隅。	四形如摩尼者，為摩尼狀有於八楞，似方不方、似圓不圓，故異下八隅。	Fourth, the shape is like a maṇi jewel. It has eight corners, resembling a square but not a square, resembling a circle but not a circle, thus differing from the eight corners below.

['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c18_5']	或有九事，加純淨言故。	或有九事，加純淨言故。	Or there may be nine aspects, adding the word pure.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c18_17']	準此，若無此言即通染淨。	準此，若無此言即通染淨。	Based on this, if there is no such word, it is common to both the defiled and pure.

['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c22_5']	其第十三主剎即此娑婆。	其第十三主剎即此娑婆。	The thirteenth main realm is this Sahā world.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c22_16']	言形如虛空者，靜法云：	言形如虛空者，靜法云：	Regarding the statement that its shape is like empty space, Jingfa says:
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c24_9']	大小乘經並說虛空體無形質、不可見相，今云有形者，迴文者誤。	大小乘經並說虛空體無形質、不可見相，今云有形者，迴文者誤。	Both the Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna sūtras say that the substance of empty space has no form or substance and cannot be seen. Now, it is said to have a shape. This is a mistake in the translation.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c28_10']	梵本云三曼多周圓第縛皤嚩曩天宮伽伽那虛空阿楞迦羅莊嚴蓋覆僧塞恒那形狀，迴文應以形狀置周圓之前、虛空安天宮之上，然後合綴飾云其形周圓以空居天宮莊嚴之具而覆其上。	梵本云三曼多周圓第縛皤嚩曩天宮伽伽那虛空阿楞迦羅莊嚴蓋覆僧塞恒那形狀，迴文應以形狀置周圓之前、虛空安天宮之上，然後合綴飾云其形周圓以空居天宮莊嚴之具而覆其上。	The Sanskrit text says samanta (universal), prabhāsa (light), nagara (city), gagana (empty space), and ālakṣaṇa (adorned). The translation should place shape before universal and empty space above city, and then combine and embellish it, saying that its shape is universal, and it is covered above with the adornments of the heavenly palace in empty space.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0582c29_11']	靜法此正深有理致，今依經通之亦有理在。	靜法此正深有理致，今依經通之亦有理在。	Jingfa's interpretation is indeed very reasonable, but now I will explain it according to the sutra, which is also reasonable.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a02_14']	謂空雖無形，隨俗說故，以俗典指空為天，謂天為圓穹，其形如𨫼，故說天勢圍平野。	謂空雖無形，隨俗說故，以俗典指空為天，謂天為圓穹，其形如𨫼，故說天勢圍平野。	It means that although space is formless, it is spoken of in terms of convention. In secular texts, space is called heaven, and heaven is said to be a circular vault, shaped like a drum, so it is said that the power of heaven surrounds the flat fields.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a03_16']	亦如《法華》云「梵王為眾生之父」，亦隨俗說耳。	亦如《法華》云「梵王為眾生之父」，亦隨俗說耳。	It is also like the Lotus Sutra saying that Brahma is the father of sentient beings, which is also spoken in terms of convention.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a04_10']	第十五云形如卍字者，靜法云：	第十五云形如卍字者，靜法云：	The fifteenth says its shape is like the character wan (卍). Jingfa says:
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a05_15']	室離靺瑳本非是字，乃是德者之相，正云吉祥海雲。	室離靺瑳本非是字，乃是德者之相，正云吉祥海雲。	The character srim is originally not a character, but a symbol of virtue, which is correctly called auspicious ocean clouds.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a06_7']	眾德深廣如海，益物如雲。	眾德深廣如海，益物如雲。	Its many virtues are as deep and vast as the ocean, and it benefits beings like clouds.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a07_15']	古來三藏誤譯洛剎曩為惡剎攞，遂以相為字，故為謬耳。	古來三藏誤譯洛剎曩為惡剎攞，遂以相為字，故為謬耳。	In the past, the Tripiṭaka master mistakenly translated lakṣma as akṣara, and thus took the symbol to be a character, which is a mistake.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a09_13']	今義通此相以為吉祥萬德之所集成，因目為萬，意在語略而義含，合云萬相耳。	今義通此相以為吉祥萬德之所集成，因目為萬，意在語略而義含，合云萬相耳。	Now I interpret this symbol as the accumulation of myriad virtues, and thus call it wan (myriad). The intention is to use few words while encompassing the meaning, and should be combined to say myriad symbols.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a09_18']	餘並易了。	餘並易了。	The rest are easy to understand.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a10_6']	第三類結所餘。	第三類結所餘。	The third is a general conclusion of the remaining.

['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a13_9']	一總結都數、二「各各所依」下結形類、三「此一一」下結眷屬、四「如是所說」下彰其所在。	一總結都數、二「各各所依」下結形類、三「此一一」下結眷屬、四「如是所說」下彰其所在。	First, a general conclusion of the total number; second, below each according to its basis, a conclusion of the forms; third, below each of these, a conclusion of the retinue; fourth, below what has been said, an indication of its location.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a14_3']	今初，即舉本剎種結有若干。	今初，即舉本剎種結有若干。	Now, the first is raising the main buddha-realm species to conclude the number.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a15_11']	此所結剎定是主剎，以下文指此不可說佛剎更有兩重繞故。	此所結剎定是主剎，以下文指此不可說佛剎更有兩重繞故。	The buddha-realms concluded here are definitely the main buddha-realms, because the text below points out that there are two more layers surrounding the buddha-realms that cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a17_1']	其直上中間但有十九佛剎，而結有不可說者，以傍論故。	其直上中間但有十九佛剎，而結有不可說者，以傍論故。	The straight upward middle only has nineteen buddha-realms, but concludes with inconceivable, because it is a side discussion.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a17_4']	不爾。	不爾。	Otherwise,
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a18_14']	豈一剎種最下唯一主剎，故知如向所說，主剎橫竪共論有不可說故。	豈一剎種最下唯一主剎，故知如向所說，主剎橫竪共論有不可說故。	how could there be only one main buddha-realm at the very bottom of a buddha-realm species? Therefore, it should be known that the main buddha-realms discussed above are discussed together horizontally and vertically, and thus are inconceivable.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a19_13']	下結其所在，云及在香水河中，思之。	下結其所在，云及在香水河中，思之。	Below, it concludes their location, saying they are in the fragrant rivers. Contemplate this.

['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a20_17']	既言周匝圍遶，則知旁去。	既言周匝圍遶，則知旁去。	Since it says they surround it on all sides, we know they are on the sides.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a21_16']	二「所謂」下，廣說十門形狀有十八事。	二「所謂」下，廣說十門形狀有十八事。	Second, below what is called, it extensively explains the ten gates. The shapes have eighteen things.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a23_6']	望前剎種形中，闕須彌山形及嚴具形，餘皆全同，但此約剎為異耳。	望前剎種形中，闕須彌山形及嚴具形，餘皆全同，但此約剎為異耳。	Compared to the shapes of the various realms in the previous realm-wombs, it lacks the shapes of Mount Sumeru and ornaments. The rest are all the same, but this is different in terms of the realms.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a23_19']	三「如是等」下，結歸都數。	三「如是等」下，結歸都數。	Third, below such as these, it concludes by returning to the total number.

['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a27_7']	又是欲顯無盡義故。	又是欲顯無盡義故。	It is also in order to manifest the meaning of inexhaustibility.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a28_11']	一一復有如上所說微塵數者，如上之言文含二義：	一一復有如上所說微塵數者，如上之言文含二義：	Each of them also has the number of dust motes as explained above. The words as explained above contain two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583a29_18']	一即總指前能繞所繞之數繞一世界，不欲繁文，故云如上。	一即總指前能繞所繞之數繞一世界，不欲繁文，故云如上。	The first is to point out in general the number of those who can surround and those who are surrounded, and to surround one world. Not wanting to be verbose, it says as explained above.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583b01_14']	二者如上，亦用十佛剎為能繞也。	二者如上，亦用十佛剎為能繞也。	The second is that as above also uses ten buddha-lands as the able to surround.
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583b03_4']	依此則似譯人文繁理隱，何不言一一復有十佛剎塵數耶？	依此則似譯人文繁理隱，何不言一一復有十佛剎塵數耶？	According to this, it seems that the translator's text is verbose and the principle is hidden. Why not say that each has the number of dust motes in ten buddha-lands?
['ZH_T35_1735_012:0583b03_14']	若依前義則譯者之妙。	若依前義則譯者之妙。	If according to the previous meaning, then it is the translator's subtlety.
