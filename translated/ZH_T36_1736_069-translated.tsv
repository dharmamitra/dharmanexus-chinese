['ZH_T36_1736_069:0549c10_3']	是故結云「前二破相入如，後二證實捨相。	是故結云「前二破相入如，後二證實捨相。	Therefore, it is concluded: The first two subsume characteristics and enter suchness, while the last two realize the truth and abandon characteristics.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0549c11_3']	」一破有相，二破無相，二俱破相，二俱入如。	」一破有相，二破無相，二俱破相，二俱入如。	The first refutes having characteristics, the second refutes not having characteristics, the second refutes both having and not having characteristics, and the second enters suchness.

['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b16_5']	是故智障有其三門：	是故智障有其三門：	Therefore, the wisdom obstacles have three gates:
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b17_1']	一是智障，所謂分別有無之心；	一是智障，所謂分別有無之心；	The first is the wisdom obstacle, namely the mind that discriminates existence and non-existence;
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b18_6']	二是體障，謂觀非有非無之解，立已能知，故曰體障；	二是體障，謂觀非有非無之解，立已能知，故曰體障；	The second is the obstacle of substance, namely the understanding that observes neither existence nor non-existence, establishing what one can know oneself, thus called the obstacle of substance;
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b19_1']	三是治想，謂妄識中含如正慧。	三是治想，謂妄識中含如正慧。	The third is the thought of treatment, namely the true wisdom contained within false consciousness.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b19_10']	依此地中有其三義：	依此地中有其三義：	There are three meanings in this stage:
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b21_8']	初一、四地乃至七地斷除，四五六地斷除分別取有之心，謂解法慢、身淨慢等。	初一、四地乃至七地斷除，四五六地斷除分別取有之心，謂解法慢、身淨慢等。	The first is that from the fourth to the seventh stages, the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages eliminate the mind that grasps at existence, namely the conceit of understanding dharmas, the conceit of the purity of the body, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b22_12']	入七地時斷除分別取有無之心，八地已上斷除體障。	入七地時斷除分別取有無之心，八地已上斷除體障。	When entering the seventh stage, one eliminates the discriminating mind that grasps at existence and nonexistence. From the eighth stage onward, one eliminates the obstacle of substance.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b24_3']	前第七地雖除分別有無之心，猶見己心以為能觀、如為所觀。	前第七地雖除分別有無之心，猶見己心以為能觀、如為所觀。	Although in the previous seventh stage one eliminates the discriminating mind of existence and nonexistence, one still sees one's own mind as the subject of contemplation and suchness as the object of contemplation.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b26_7']	其所觀如不即心、能觀之心不即如，心如別故，心外求法故有功用，法外立心故有體障。	其所觀如不即心、能觀之心不即如，心如別故，心外求法故有功用，法外立心故有體障。	The suchness that is contemplated is not the same as the mind, and the mind that is the subject of contemplation is not the same as suchness. Because the mind and suchness are separate, one seeks dharmas outside the mind, and therefore there is effort. Because the mind is established outside the dharmas, there is the obstacle of substance.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b28_9']	從第七地入八地時，破捨此障，觀察如外由來無心、心外無如，如外無心，心不異如；	從第七地入八地時，破捨此障，觀察如外由來無心、心外無如，如外無心，心不異如；	From the seventh stage entering the eighth stage, one breaks through and abandons this obstacle, contemplating that outside of suchness there has never been a mind, and outside the mind there is no suchness. Because there is no mind outside of suchness, the mind is not different from suchness;
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551b28_19']	心外無如，如不異心。	心外無如，如不異心。	because there is no suchness outside the mind, suchness is not different from the mind.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551c01_1']	故能如心泯同法界，廣大不動，以不異故。	故能如心泯同法界，廣大不動，以不異故。	Therefore, it can be like the mind, merging with the Dharma realm, vast and unmoving, because it is not different.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551c02_15']	自外推求故捨功用，不復如外建立神智，故滅體障，體障滅故名無障想。	自外推求故捨功用，不復如外建立神智，故滅體障，體障滅故名無障想。	Pushing outward to seek, one abandons effort and no longer establishes spiritual wisdom externally, thus extinguishing the obstacle of substance. Because the obstacle of substance is extinguished, it is called the thought of no obstruction.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551c04_3']	第三治想至佛方滅，故入八地雖無障想而有治想。	第三治想至佛方滅，故入八地雖無障想而有治想。	The third thought of remedy is extinguished only upon reaching Buddhahood, so even though there is the thought of no obstruction upon entering the eighth ground, there is still the thought of remedy.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551c05_13']	從八地已上，無生忍體轉轉寂滅，令彼治想運運自亡，至佛乃窮。	從八地已上，無生忍體轉轉寂滅，令彼治想運運自亡，至佛乃窮。	From the eighth ground and above, the essence of the forbearance of non-arising gradually becomes quiescent and extinguished, causing the thought of remedy to gradually disappear on its own, reaching its end upon becoming a Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1736_069:0551c06_4', 'ZH_T36_1736_069:0551c07_3']	今此未盡，故說非無。🔽疏「故云此想於下地」下，第三別釋文相。	今此未盡，故說非無。 疏「故云此想於下地」下，第三別釋文相。	This has not yet been exhausted, so it is said to not be nonexistent.🔽The commentary's Therefore, this thought is below the ground is the third specific explanation of the textual meaning.
