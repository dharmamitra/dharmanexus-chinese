One should know that the three periods mentioned above exist only in the conditioned arising of sentient beings. Although there are twelve links, they are of three or two natures. The three are afflictions, karma, and events. The two are effect and cause.

['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c17_3']	前際因無明，後際因愛取，如是三種，煩惱為性。	前際因無明，後際因愛取，如是三種，煩惱為性。	028	The cause in the past is ignorance, the cause in the future is craving and grasping. These three are of the nature of afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c18_2']	前際因行，後際因有，如是二種，以業為性。	前際因行，後際因有，如是二種，以業為性。	028	The cause in the past is karmic formations, the cause in the future is becoming. These two are of the nature of karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c19_5']	前際識等五，後際生老死，如是七名事，惑業所依故。	前際識等五，後際生老死，如是七名事，惑業所依故。	028	The five beginning with consciousness in the past, and birth and old age and death in the future, these seven are called events, because they are the basis of afflictions and karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c20_13']	如是七事，即亦名果，義准餘五即亦名因，以煩惱業為自性故。	如是七事，即亦名果，義准餘五即亦名因，以煩惱業為自性故。	028	These seven are also called fruits, and the other five are also called causes, because they are by nature passions and actions.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c21_13']	何緣中際廣說因果，後際略果，前際略因？	何緣中際廣說因果，後際略果，前際略因？	028	Why is the middle portion of the chain of causation explained in detail with regard to causes and effects, while the future effects are explained briefly, and the past causes are explained briefly?
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c22_11']	中際易知應廣說二，前後難了各略說一。	中際易知應廣說二，前後難了各略說一。	028	The middle portion is easy to understand and should be explained in detail with regard to both causes and effects. The past and future are difficult to understand and are therefore explained briefly.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c23_11']	由中比二，具廣已成，故不別說，說便無用。	由中比二，具廣已成，故不別說，說便無用。	028	The past and future are easy to understand if one infers from the middle portion. Therefore they are not explained in detail, because such an explanation would serve no purpose.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c23_20']	如何別立愛取二支？	如何別立愛取二支？	028	Why are craving and grasping established separately as two members?
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c25_16']	毘婆沙師許初念愛以愛聲說，即此相續增廣熾盛立以取名，相續取境轉堅猛故。	毘婆沙師許初念愛以愛聲說，即此相續增廣熾盛立以取名，相續取境轉堅猛故。	028	The Vaibhāṣikas admit that the first moment of craving is called craving, and that this same craving, when it increases and expands, is called grasping, because the grasping of objects becomes more intense.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c26_15']	若爾，應說三支剎那，何故唯言二剎那性？	若爾，應說三支剎那，何故唯言二剎那性？	028	If this is so, then why is it said that the three members are by nature two moments?
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c27_15']	無斯過失，一一境中各一剎那，合成多故。	無斯過失，一一境中各一剎那，合成多故。	028	There is no error here, because although there is only one moment for each object, there are many moments in combination.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0496c29_3']	正結生位唯一剎那，於一身中無容再結，故生與識獨說剎那。	正結生位唯一剎那，於一身中無容再結，故生與識獨說剎那。	028	The moment of the actualization of rebirth is only a single moment, and it is impossible to actualize rebirth twice in a single lifetime. Therefore only birth and consciousness are said to be moments.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a01_2']	何緣現在諸煩惱位，偏說於愛非餘煩惱？	何緣現在諸煩惱位，偏說於愛非餘煩惱？	028	Why is it that among the various states of the present, only craving is said to be so, and not the other passions?
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a02_1']	於愛易了愛味過患，餘煩惱中此相難了。	於愛易了愛味過患，餘煩惱中此相難了。	028	The faults of craving and the taste of craving are easy to understand, but these characteristics are difficult to understand in the other passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a04_8']	愛是能感後有勝因，世尊偏說，令知過患云何，當令勤求治道，故唯說愛剎那、相續二位差別，非餘煩惱。	愛是能感後有勝因，世尊偏說，令知過患云何，當令勤求治道，故唯說愛剎那、相續二位差別，非餘煩惱。	028	Craving is the superior cause that attracts subsequent existence. The World Honored One spoke of it in a biased way in order to make people understand its faults and diligently seek the path of its elimination. Therefore he only spoke of the two states of craving, the moment and the continuity, and not the other passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a04_13']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	028	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a05_15']	一切煩惱初緣境時說名為愛，後增廣位說名為取。	一切煩惱初緣境時說名為愛，後增廣位說名為取。	028	When all the passions first take an object, they are called craving. Later, when they increase and expand, they are called grasping.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a08_1']	故佛雖說業因於愛，愛因無明，而實業因通一切煩惱，一切煩惱皆無明為因，故知愛聲通說諸惑。	故佛雖說業因於愛，愛因無明，而實業因通一切煩惱，一切煩惱皆無明為因，故知愛聲通說諸惑。	028	Therefore, although the Buddha said that action has craving as its cause and craving has ignorance as its cause, in reality action has all the passions as its cause, and all the passions have ignorance as their cause. Therefore we know that the term craving generally refers to all the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a09_9']	欲令因此總知過患，故以愛聲說諸煩惱，非餘煩惱，招生劣故。	欲令因此總知過患，故以愛聲說諸煩惱，非餘煩惱，招生劣故。	028	It is in order to make one know in general the faults of the three poisons that the term thirst is used to indicate all passions, because the other passions are weak in attracting the body of another birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a10_16']	有說愛聲唯說愛體，多現行故，由此於愛分別剎那相續差別。	有說愛聲唯說愛體，多現行故，由此於愛分別剎那相續差別。	028	There is an opinion that the term thirst refers only to craving, because it is most active, and therefore it distinguishes the difference of momentariness and continuity in craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a11_9']	雖非無此理，然前說為勝。	雖非無此理，然前說為勝。	028	Although this is not without its rationale, the former explanation is better.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a12_15']	若緣起支唯有十二，老死無果，離修對治道，生死應有終；	若緣起支唯有十二，老死無果，離修對治道，生死應有終；	028	If the members of conditioned arising are only twelve, old age and death have no effect, and apart from the path of cultivation of antidotes, samsara would have an end.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a13_5']	無明無因，無明是初故。	無明無因，無明是初故。	028	Ignorance would have no cause, because it is the beginning.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a14_11']	生死應有始，或應更立餘緣起支，餘復有餘，成無窮過。	生死應有始，或應更立餘緣起支，餘復有餘，成無窮過。	028	Samsara would have a beginning, or it would be necessary to establish other members of conditioned arising, and these would require others, resulting in an infinite regress.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a15_6']	又佛聖教應成缺減，然不應許。	又佛聖教應成缺減，然不應許。	028	Also, the holy teachings of the Buddha would be incomplete, but this cannot be admitted.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a15_20']	此難不然，未了所說緣起理故。	此難不然，未了所說緣起理故。	028	This objection is not valid, because the principle of conditioned arising that is being discussed is not yet understood.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a16_9']	此緣起理，云何應知？	此緣起理，云何應知？	028	How should the principle of conditioned arising be understood?
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a16_12']	頌曰：	頌曰：	028	A verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a17_0']	從惑生惑業，　　從業生於事，	從惑生惑業，　　從業生於事，	028	From delusion arise delusion and action, and from action arises the event.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a18_13']	從事事惑生，　　有支理唯此。	從事事惑生，　　有支理唯此。	028	Arising from the various delusions, the members of existence are only this.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a19_2']	論曰：	論曰：	028	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a20_15']	唯聲正顯有支數定，兼顯業與惑或俱或後生，是惑生惑時，業俱或後義。	唯聲正顯有支數定，兼顯業與惑或俱或後生，是惑生惑時，業俱或後義。	028	The word only correctly shows that the number of members of existence is fixed, and also shows that karma and delusions may arise together or later. This is the meaning of delusions giving rise to delusions, and karma arising together with or after delusions.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a21_12']	由如是理，總攝有支即已善通前所設難。	由如是理，總攝有支即已善通前所設難。	028	By this principle, the members of existence are comprehensively included, and the previous objections are well resolved.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a22_3', 'ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a22_18']	從惑生惑，謂愛生取。🔽從惑生業，謂取生有，無明生行。	從惑生惑，謂愛生取。 從惑生業，謂取生有，無明生行。	028	Delusions giving rise to delusions means craving giving rise to grasping.🔽Delusions giving rise to karma means grasping giving rise to existence, and ignorance giving rise to volitional activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a23_12']	從業生事，謂行生識及有生生。	從業生事，謂行生識及有生生。	028	Karma giving rise to events means volitional activity giving rise to consciousness, and existence giving rise to birth.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a25_7']	從事生事，謂從識支生於名色，乃至從觸生於受支，及從生支生於老死。	從事生事，謂從識支生於名色，乃至從觸生於受支，及從生支生於老死。	028	Events giving rise to events means consciousness giving rise to name-and-form, up to contact giving rise to feeling, and birth giving rise to old age and death.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a25_17']	從事生惑，謂受生愛。	從事生惑，謂受生愛。	028	Events giving rise to delusions means feeling giving rise to craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a26_7']	由立有支，其理唯此。	由立有支，其理唯此。	028	The principle of establishing the members of existence is only this.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497a28_13']	已成老死為事惑因，老死即如現四支故，及成無明為事惑果，無明即如現愛取故，豈假更立餘緣起支？	已成老死為事惑因，老死即如現四支故，及成無明為事惑果，無明即如現愛取故，豈假更立餘緣起支？	028	Old age and death are the results of the causes of the passions, because old age and death are like the present four members, and old age and death are the causes of the passions of ignorance, because ignorance is like the present thirst and grasping. How can it be necessary to establish other members of the chain of dependent origination?
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b01_15']	故經言如是純大苦蘊集，是前後二際更相顯發義，是故無有老死、無明無果無因有終始過。	故經言如是純大苦蘊集，是前後二際更相顯發義，是故無有老死、無明無果無因有終始過。	028	Therefore a scripture says, The mass of this great suffering aggregates arises in this way. This is the meaning of the mutual manifestation of the two members of the chain of dependent origination in the past and future. Consequently, there is no old age and death without ignorance, and there is no ignorance without old age and death. There is no beginning or end.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b03_13']	於此定攝因果義周，無更立支成無窮過，由佛遍說因果無遺，故無聖教成缺減失。	於此定攝因果義周，無更立支成無窮過，由佛遍說因果無遺，故無聖教成缺減失。	028	The meaning of cause and result is completely included in these two members, and there is no error of an infinite regress in postulating the other members of the chain of dependent origination. Because the Buddha completely explained cause and result without omission, there is no error of incompleteness in the holy teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b04_3']	此中上座作是釋言：	此中上座作是釋言：	028	Here the Sthavira interprets this matter as follows:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b05_6']	餘經中說，非理作意為無明因，無明復生非理作意。	餘經中說，非理作意為無明因，無明復生非理作意。	028	Other scriptures say that incorrect thought is the cause of ignorance, and ignorance again produces incorrect thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b06_1']	非理作意說在觸時，故餘經說：	非理作意說在觸時，故餘經說：	028	Incorrect thought is said to exist at the time of contact, and therefore another scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b06_15']	眼色為緣，生癡所生染濁作意。	眼色為緣，生癡所生染濁作意。	028	The eye and form as conditions produce defiled and turbid thought born of delusion.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b07_9']	此於受位必引無明，故餘經言：	此於受位必引無明，故餘經言：	028	Because it definitely produces ignorance at the time of feeling. Therefore another scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b08_3']	由無明觸，所生諸受為緣生愛。	由無明觸，所生諸受為緣生愛。	028	The various feelings produced by contact associated with ignorance serve as conditions for the arising of craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b09_2']	是故觸時非理作意與受俱轉，無明為緣。	是故觸時非理作意與受俱轉，無明為緣。	028	Therefore at the time of contact, improper attention occurs together with feeling, with ignorance as its condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b10_1']	由此無明無無因過，亦不須立餘緣起支。	由此無明無無因過，亦不須立餘緣起支。	028	Consequently, ignorance does not have the fault of having no cause, nor is it necessary to establish other members of dependent origination.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b11_1']	又緣起支無無窮失，非理作意從癡生故。	又緣起支無無窮失，非理作意從癡生故。	028	Also, the members of dependent origination do not have the fault of infinite regress, because improper attention is born from delusion.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b11_6']	如契經說：	如契經說：	028	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b12_1']	眼色為緣，生癡所生染濁作意。	眼色為緣，生癡所生染濁作意。	028	The eye and form as conditions give rise to the defiled and turbid attention born of delusion.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b12_19']	餘經雖有如是誠言，然此經中應更須說。	餘經雖有如是誠言，然此經中應更須說。	028	Although other scriptures have these true words, they should still be explained in this scripture.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b13_17']	若由理故不說自成，則一切支皆不應說。	若由理故不說自成，則一切支皆不應說。	028	If they are not explained because they are established by principle, then all members should not be explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b15_6']	設許理有，文但略標，便違自執此經了義，許此經文非盡理故。	設許理有，文但略標，便違自執此經了義，許此經文非盡理故。	028	Even if it is admitted that they exist by principle but are merely briefly indicated in the text, then it contradicts your own doctrine that this scripture is definitive, because you admit that the text of this scripture is not exhaustive of principle.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b16_5']	凡諸所有不盡理文，智者判為非了義故。	凡諸所有不盡理文，智者判為非了義故。	028	Because all texts that are not exhaustive of principle are judged by the wise to be not definitive.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b17_4']	既許理有，非載此文便證支名從勝而立。	既許理有，非載此文便證支名從勝而立。	028	Since it is admitted that there is a principle, this text cannot be used to prove that the name of a member is established from the superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b18_10']	且此經雖言六處緣觸，而上座亦許緣識作意，以契經說：	且此經雖言六處緣觸，而上座亦許緣識作意，以契經說：	028	Moreover, although this sūtra says that the six sense bases are the condition for contact, the Sthavira also admits that consciousness and attention are conditions, because a sūtra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b19_6']	眼及色為緣，生於眼識及染濁作意。	眼及色為緣，生於眼識及染濁作意。	028	The eye and form as conditions give rise to visual consciousness and defiled attention.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b22_3']	雖緣六處亦生識等，而此但言六處緣觸，如是觸緣非唯六處，但六處位六處最強、於觸位中觸最為勝，就勝而說，餘例應思。	雖緣六處亦生識等，而此但言六處緣觸，如是觸緣非唯六處，但六處位六處最強、於觸位中觸最為勝，就勝而說，餘例應思。	028	Although consciousness, etc., are also produced with the six sense bases as conditions, this sūtra only says that the six sense bases are the condition for contact. In the same way, contact as a condition is not only the six sense bases. But in the stage of the six sense bases, the six sense bases are the strongest, and in the stage of contact, contact is the most superior. It is said in terms of the superior, and the rest should be considered in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b24_1']	然經主言，經不別說老死有果、無明有因，生死便成有終始者，此難非理，經意別故。	然經主言，經不別說老死有果、無明有因，生死便成有終始者，此難非理，經意別故。	028	However, the author of the commentary says that if the sūtra does not separately say that old age and death have a result and ignorance has a cause, then birth and death would have a beginning and end. This objection is unreasonable, because the meaning of the sūtra is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b24_10']	亦非所說理不圓滿。	亦非所說理不圓滿。	028	It is also not the case that what is said is not complete.

['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b25_8']	此經但欲除所化者三際愚故。	此經但欲除所化者三際愚故。	028	This sūtra only wishes to eliminate the delusion of the three periods of time of those to be taught.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b25_17']	由所化者唯生是疑：	由所化者唯生是疑：	028	Because those to be taught only give rise to this doubt:
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b27_6']	云何有情三世連續，謂從前世今世得生，今世復能生於後世？	云何有情三世連續，謂從前世今世得生，今世復能生於後世？	028	How is it that sentient beings are connected through the three times? It means that from the previous world one is born in this world, and from this world one is able to give rise to the next world.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497b28_18']	如來但為除彼疑情說十二支，如前已辯，謂前後中際，為遣他愚惑。	如來但為除彼疑情說十二支，如前已辯，謂前後中際，為遣他愚惑。	028	The Tathāgata merely removes their doubts and speaks of the twelve links, as explained above. The middle and later links are to dispel the delusion of others.
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497c01_14']	今詳經主苟欲違背毘婆沙宗，捨自劬勞所作如理釋疑難頌，所謂從惑生惑業等。	今詳經主苟欲違背毘婆沙宗，捨自劬勞所作如理釋疑難頌，所謂從惑生惑業等。	028	Now, if the author of the treatise wishes to go against the tenets of the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra, abandon his own well-reasoned explanation of the difficult points in the verses he composed, namely From delusion arise delusion and karma, etc.,
['ZH_T29_1562_028:0497c05_10']	自謂所言能免他難，今詳彼釋於難未免，謂雖欲遣他三際愚說緣起教，而不具說老死有果、無明有因，非不了知前因後果相連續義，名諸所化已能除遣前後際愚。	自謂所言能免他難，今詳彼釋於難未免，謂雖欲遣他三際愚說緣起教，而不具說老死有果、無明有因，非不了知前因後果相連續義，名諸所化已能除遣前後際愚。	028	and claim that what he says can avoid the difficulties of others, now, when examining his explanation, he has not yet avoided the difficulty. It means that although he wishes to remove the delusion of others regarding the three periods of time by teaching dependent origination, he does not fully explain that old age and death have results and ignorance has causes.
