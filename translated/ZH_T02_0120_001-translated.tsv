Those who destroy the true Dharma should be subdued, like the eighty great arhats headed by Mahākāśyapa, up to Aśvajit. They all abandoned their great treasures, left home to study the path, and had few desires and were content in the true Dharma. Why do the bhikṣus need to use priceless robes?
['ZH_T02_0120_001:0521c28_18']	是等一切剃髮除慢，孤遊持鉢乞食活命著壞色衣，如是比丘云何放逸？	是等一切剃髮除慢，孤遊持鉢乞食活命著壞色衣，如是比丘云何放逸？	They all shave their heads to remove arrogance, wander alone carrying alms bowls, beg for food to sustain their lives, and wear dyed robes. How can such bhikṣus be negligent?
['ZH_T02_0120_001:0522a02_16']	常為寒暑饑渴所逼，足蹈塵土恒如野鹿，不越小戒如犛牛愛尾，守護不捨如烏伏子，如折牙象無復形好，彼復何須習無價衣？	常為寒暑饑渴所逼，足蹈塵土恒如野鹿，不越小戒如犛牛愛尾，守護不捨如烏伏子，如折牙象無復形好，彼復何須習無價衣？	They are always oppressed by cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. Their feet tread in dust and dirt, always like wild deer. They do not violate minor precepts like a qilin loves its tail. They guard and do not let go like a crow subdues its young. Like an elephant with broken tusks has no more beautiful form, why do they need to use priceless robes?
['ZH_T02_0120_001:0522a05_11']	汝正法外人慎勿復語，如彼外道旃陀羅輩，畢竟不入二生眾中，汝亦如是，是正法外旃陀羅也，汝小蚊蚋默然無聲。	汝正法外人慎勿復語，如彼外道旃陀羅輩，畢竟不入二生眾中，汝亦如是，是正法外旃陀羅也，汝小蚊蚋默然無聲。	You are an outsider to the true Dharma, do not speak again! Like those heretical outcasts, you will never enter the assembly of the two kinds of beings. You are like this, an outcast to the true Dharma. You are a small mosquito, be silent!
