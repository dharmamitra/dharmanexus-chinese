['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c16_13']	二約化中，一無體即空義，謂攬緣無性，故云於無化法中。	二約化中，一無體即空義，謂攬緣無性，故云於無化法中。	Second, in terms of transformation, first, the meaning of having no substance and being empty, referring to embracing conditions and having no nature, therefore it says within the Dharma of no transformation.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c17_9']	二從緣幻有義，故云示有變化形。	二從緣幻有義，故云示有變化形。	Second, from the meaning of illusory existence arising from conditions, it is said that there are forms of transformation.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c17_17']	二融合中亦二義：	二融合中亦二義：	The second, the fusion, also has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c18_9']	一真化別合、二真化融通。	一真化別合、二真化融通。	First, the true and the transformed are combined separately, and second, the true and the transformed are fused and interpenetrate.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c20_2']	初中，由真中隨緣即不變故，是故亦真亦非真，非真非不真，名真法身。	初中，由真中隨緣即不變故，是故亦真亦非真，非真非不真，名真法身。	In the beginning, because the true follows conditions and is unchanging, therefore it is both true and not true, neither true nor not true, and is called the true Dharma body.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c21_11']	化中，體空即幻有故，是故亦化亦非化，非化非不化，名為佛化身。	化中，體空即幻有故，是故亦化亦非化，非化非不化，名為佛化身。	In the transformation, the essence is empty and thus illusory, therefore it is both transformation and not transformation, neither transformation nor not transformation, and is called the Buddha's transformation body.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c23_2']	二融通者，謂由真不變，顯化體空，此真不無、化不有，以為法身。	二融通者，謂由真不變，顯化體空，此真不無、化不有，以為法身。	The second, the fusion, means that because the true is unchanging, it reveals the emptiness of the transformed essence. This true is not nonexistent, and the transformation is not existent, and is taken as the Dharma body.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c23_16']	而不無化用，以有化中空義故。	而不無化用，以有化中空義故。	But it is not without the function of transformation, because there is the meaning of emptiness within transformation.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c25_4']	又由真隨緣顯化幻有，此是化不無、真不有，以為化身。	又由真隨緣顯化幻有，此是化不無、真不有，以為化身。	Moreover, because the true follows conditions and reveals the illusory existence of transformation, this is the transformation that is not nonexistent, and the truth is not existent, and is taken as the transformation body.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c26_1']	而不無真理，以有真中隨緣義故。	而不無真理，以有真中隨緣義故。	But it is not without true principle, because there is the meaning of following conditions within truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c26_17']	又由隨緣幻有，不異不變，體空故。	又由隨緣幻有，不異不變，體空故。	Moreover, it is because of following conditions and being illusory, not different from the unchanging, and the essence being empty.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0692c27_17']	是故現化紛然未嘗不寂，真性湛然未曾不化。	是故現化紛然未嘗不寂，真性湛然未曾不化。	Therefore, the manifested transformations are in confusion, yet they are never not tranquil; the true nature is tranquil, yet it has never not transformed.

The previous verse concludes and returns to the essence, meaning that wisdom merges with the true realm, equal to the Dharma realm, therefore profound and bottomless, equal to empty space, therefore vast and boundless, all transcending verbal expression, being immeasurable.

The first verse establishes the thesis. The upper half cites false emotions, and the lower half correctly establishes that bodhi is the property of the subject and definitely not bound by time is the property of the thesis.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b06_1']	次偈立三因：	次偈立三因：	Next, the verse establishes three reasons:

['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b08_3']	次偈舉同喻，謂日體常明，故不合昏夜。	次偈舉同喻，謂日體常明，故不合昏夜。	Next, the verse cites a common example, namely, the sun's essence is always bright, so it does not correspond with the dark night.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b08_16']	後偈合結，上半合、下半結。	後偈合結，上半合、下半結。	The last verse combines and concludes. The upper half combines, and the lower half concludes.

It should be said that bodhi is the subject, definitely not bound to days but teaching days according to the capacity is the thesis, the reason is that the essence is not in the three times, etc., and does not obstruct the three times, etc., the same example is like the sun disc not corresponding to the dark night, but because it is blocked by mountains, it is said to have days and nights. The combination is that the Buddha has no three times, because he does not correspond to the capacity of beings to be seen, and therefore teaches the three times.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b16_1']	是則上三句皆合，下一句結。	是則上三句皆合，下一句結。	This then combines the previous three statements and concludes with the fourth.

['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b23_13']	所以得名佛者，正覺真智，力無畏等無不具故，得名為佛。	所以得名佛者，正覺真智，力無畏等無不具故，得名為佛。	The reason for being called a Buddha is because of the correct realization of true wisdom, and because of being fully endowed with the powers, fearlessnesses, and so forth, one is called a Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b24_4']	佛佛皆然，故義同也。	佛佛皆然，故義同也。	All Buddhas are the same, so the meaning is the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b25_17']	又應用利樂無不同故，故《攝論》第十云「諸佛法身應知恒時能作五業」等。	又應用利樂無不同故，故《攝論》第十云「諸佛法身應知恒時能作五業」等。	Moreover, it is because the application of benefit and joy is the same. Therefore, the Tenth Chapter of the Compendium Treatise says, It should be known that the Dharma body of all Buddhas is always able to perform five kinds of activities and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b27_10']	二十一種功德之中，名為逮得一切佛平等性，所依意樂作業無差別故。	二十一種功德之中，名為逮得一切佛平等性，所依意樂作業無差別故。	Among the twenty-one kinds of merits, it is called attaining the equality of all Buddhas, because of the non-difference of support, intention, and activity.
['ZH_T35_1735_025:0693b28_17']	二約十身釋義同者，皆通三世間，彼此互望無差別故。	二約十身釋義同者，皆通三世間，彼此互望無差別故。	Second, as for explaining the same meaning by means of the ten bodies, they all pervade the three worlds, because there is no difference between each other.
