['ZH_T47_1962_001:0081c26_20']	凡住心一境，名曰凝心。	凡住心一境，名曰凝心。	001	Dwelling the mind in a single object is called concentrated mind.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0081c28_12']	且如行者，念佛之時諦觀如來玉毫金相，凝然寂靜了亮洞徹，名凝心禪。	且如行者，念佛之時諦觀如來玉毫金相，凝然寂靜了亮洞徹，名凝心禪。	001	For example, when the practitioner is mindful of the Buddha, contemplating the jade-like light and golden appearance of the Tathāgata, still and silent, clear and penetrating, it is called concentrated mind meditation.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0081c29_20']	次，前雖凝心，所習慣馳散，令制之，令還諦緣金相，名制心禪。	次，前雖凝心，所習慣馳散，令制之，令還諦緣金相，名制心禪。	001	Next, although the mind is concentrated before, habitual thoughts run wild and scatter, so control them and make them return to the object of contemplation, called controlled mind meditation.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a02_9']	復次，前雖制心，得住定境，既非理觀，皆屬事修，今體本空，誰制？	復次，前雖制心，得住定境，既非理觀，皆屬事修，今體本空，誰制？	001	Furthermore, although the mind is controlled before and abides in the determined object, since it is not a rational contemplation, it all belongs to practical cultivation. Now, realizing the original emptiness, who controls it?
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a02_20']	無佛、無念，名體真禪。	無佛、無念，名體真禪。	001	There is no Buddha, no mindfulness, called meditation on the true nature.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a03_19']	復次，前雖謂體真，猶滯空寂，無量名相昧然不知。	復次，前雖謂體真，猶滯空寂，無量名相昧然不知。	001	Next, although the true nature is realized before, it still lingers in empty silence, and countless names and forms are not known.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a05_13']	今以無所得而為方便，從空入假，萬相洞明，不為空塵之所惑亂，名方便禪。	今以無所得而為方便，從空入假，萬相洞明，不為空塵之所惑亂，名方便禪。	001	Now, using non-attainment as a skillful means, entering the provisional from emptiness, illuminating myriad phenomena, not being confused by empty dust, this is called skillful means meditation.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a07_19']	復次，體真及以方便各據空有，不離二邊，令諦觀靜亂本無相貌，名言路斷，思想亦絕，名息二邊禪。	復次，體真及以方便各據空有，不離二邊，令諦觀靜亂本無相貌，名言路斷，思想亦絕，名息二邊禪。	001	Furthermore, contemplating reality and skillful means each rely on emptiness and existence, not leaving the two extremes, causing one to contemplate stillness and disturbance as originally formless, with the path of names and words cut off, and even thoughts extinguished, this is called meditation that rests the two extremes.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a09_3']	從淺至深，如是分別，原夫圓觀亦無淺深，而淺深宛然。	從淺至深，如是分別，原夫圓觀亦無淺深，而淺深宛然。	001	From shallow to deep, distinctions are made in this way. The fundamental contemplation is also without shallow or deep, yet shallow and deep are distinct.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a09_10']	敘開念佛五門：	敘開念佛五門：	001	Here are the five gates of mindfulness of the Buddha, outlined:

['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a13_6']	諸佛大慈悲常教勅說法。	諸佛大慈悲常教勅說法。	001	The Buddhas, with great compassion and kindness, always teach and expound the Dharma.

['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a17_2']	佛言：	佛言：	001	The Buddha said:
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a18_3']	「若念佛者，當知是人即與文殊師利等無有異。	「若念佛者，當知是人即與文殊師利等無有異。	001	If one is mindful of the buddhas, one should know that this person is no different from Mañjuśrī.

['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a20_8']	此三昧者，諸佛世尊之所遊戲，首楞嚴等諸大三昧始出生處，是知將入諸佛法，方便誠多。	此三昧者，諸佛世尊之所遊戲，首楞嚴等諸大三昧始出生處，是知將入諸佛法，方便誠多。	001	This samādhi is where the buddhas and world-honored ones play, and it is the starting point for the great samādhis such as the śūraṃgama. It is known that one will enter the buddhas' teachings through many skillful means.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a21_2']	若以一言而具眾門，無過念佛。	若以一言而具眾門，無過念佛。	001	If one can use a single word to encompass many approaches, nothing surpasses being mindful of the Buddha.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a21_7']	所以者何？	所以者何？	001	Why is this so?

['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a24_4']	假如十信菩薩及三賢菩薩，皆不離念佛、念法、念僧，乃至不離念一切種智；	假如十信菩薩及三賢菩薩，皆不離念佛、念法、念僧，乃至不離念一切種智；	001	Suppose a bodhisattva of the ten stages of faith and the three ranks of worthies are all inseparable from the thought of the Buddha, the thought of the Dharma, and the thought of the Saṅgha, up to the thought of all kinds of wisdom;
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a25_20']	初地菩薩乃至八、九、十地菩薩亦不離念佛、念法、念僧，乃至不離念一切種智。	初地菩薩乃至八、九、十地菩薩亦不離念佛、念法、念僧，乃至不離念一切種智。	001	A bodhisattva of the first stage up to the eighth, ninth, and tenth stages is also inseparable from the thought of the Buddha, the thought of the Dharma, the thought of the Saṅgha, up to the thought of all kinds of wisdom.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a28_2']	但以念知差別，隨義立名，眾生迷名，妄生異解，漂墜魔界，遂輕念佛之名，仍謂已修別為勝業。	但以念知差別，隨義立名，眾生迷名，妄生異解，漂墜魔界，遂輕念佛之名，仍謂已修別為勝業。	001	But because of the difference in thought and understanding, names are established according to the meaning. Sentient beings are confused by names and give rise to false different understandings, drifting and falling into the realm of demons, and thus slight the name of the Buddha's thought, still considering it to be a separate superior practice.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082a28_12']	為愍此故，今略言之。	為愍此故，今略言之。	001	Out of pity for this, I will now briefly explain it.

['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b01_15']	修因之人，繫心常思念十方一切佛；	修因之人，繫心常思念十方一切佛；	001	The person who cultivates the causes always fixes their mind and thoughts on all the buddhas in the ten directions;
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b02_15']	證果之者又特啟此，以為微妙清淨第一禪。	證果之者又特啟此，以為微妙清淨第一禪。	001	The one who realizes the fruit especially opens this up, taking it as the subtle, wonderful, pure, and foremost meditation.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b03_9']	是知易入而證深，無過念佛。	是知易入而證深，無過念佛。	001	Therefore, we know that there is nothing better than mindfulness of the Buddha for easily entering and realizing the profound.

['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b06_2']	又諸佛以眾生樂稱諸佛名，生彼國者，則示以稱名往生門；	又諸佛以眾生樂稱諸佛名，生彼國者，則示以稱名往生門；	001	Moreover, the Buddhas, knowing that sentient beings delight in calling the Buddhas' names and being born in their lands, show them the gate of going to rebirth by calling the name;
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b07_6']	眾生有樂覩諸佛身，懼障不見者，則示以觀相滅罪門；	眾生有樂覩諸佛身，懼障不見者，則示以觀相滅罪門；	001	For sentient beings who delight in seeing the Buddhas' bodies but fear being obstructed from seeing them, they show the gate of contemplating the characteristics and extinguishing offenses;
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b08_5']	眾生有迷心執境者，則示以諸境唯心門；	眾生有迷心執境者，則示以諸境唯心門；	001	For sentient beings who are confused and grasp at objects, they show the gate of all objects being only mind;
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b09_3']	眾生有計實有者，則示以心境俱離門；	眾生有計實有者，則示以心境俱離門；	001	For sentient beings who think there is true existence, they show the gate of both mind and objects being empty;
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b10_5']	眾生樂深寂定，趣無生滅者，則示以性起圓通門。	眾生樂深寂定，趣無生滅者，則示以性起圓通門。	001	For sentient beings who delight in the profound and tranquil samadhi and seek non-arising and non-ceasing, they show the gate of the perfect interpenetration of the arising of nature.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b10_8']	大哉！	大哉！	001	How great!
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b11_15']	世尊，善拔我等，開示一道，直至菩提，甚深法門——所謂念佛。	世尊，善拔我等，開示一道，直至菩提，甚深法門——所謂念佛。	001	The World-Honored One skillfully extracts us, revealing a single path that goes straight to Bodhi, the profound Dharma gate - namely, mindfulness of the Buddha.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b14_2']	唯有大智度者，生而知之者，深修定慧者，善經論者，請撿此門，與了義大乘等經，有收義不盡處，請試言之。	唯有大智度者，生而知之者，深修定慧者，善經論者，請撿此門，與了義大乘等經，有收義不盡處，請試言之。	001	Only those with great wisdom, those born knowing, those who deeply cultivate concentration and wisdom, and those who are well-versed in the scriptures and treatises, may examine this approach and see if it encompasses all the meanings of the scriptures of the definitive great vehicle. If there are any incomplete meanings, please feel free to discuss them.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b15_6']	是知稱一佛名，智深則深，一言而具眾門，信有徵矣。	是知稱一佛名，智深則深，一言而具眾門，信有徵矣。	001	Thus, it is known that when one recites the name of a Buddha with deep wisdom, a single utterance can encompass all the approaches. This is truly a sign of faith.

['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b17_14']	假如行人，口稱南無阿彌陀佛時，心必願生彼國土，即是稱名往生門；	假如行人，口稱南無阿彌陀佛時，心必願生彼國土，即是稱名往生門；	001	Suppose a practitioner, while reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha, also wishes to be born in that land. This is the approach of reciting the name and being reborn [in the Pure Land].
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b20_1']	行者想像佛身，專注不已，遂得見佛，光明赫奕，照觸行者，爾時所有罪障，皆悉消滅，即是觀相滅罪門；	行者想像佛身，專注不已，遂得見佛，光明赫奕，照觸行者，爾時所有罪障，皆悉消滅，即是觀相滅罪門；	001	The practitioner visualizes the Buddha's body, focusing intently until they see the Buddha, with radiant light illuminating the practitioner. At that moment, all their karmic hindrances are completely eliminated. This is the approach of visualizing the Buddha's form and extinguishing offenses.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b21_3']	又觀此佛，從自心起，無別境界，即是諸境唯心門；	又觀此佛，從自心起，無別境界，即是諸境唯心門；	001	Furthermore, they contemplate that this Buddha arises from their own mind, without any separate realm. This is the approach of all realms being mind-only.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b22_3']	又觀此心，亦無自相可得，即是心境俱離門；	又觀此心，亦無自相可得，即是心境俱離門；	001	Furthermore, contemplating that this mind also has no self-nature to be attained, this is the gate of both mind and objects being absent.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b25_1']	行者爾時趣深寂定，放捨一切心意意識，將入涅槃，緣十方佛加被護念，興起智門，行者爾時於一念頃，淨佛國土，成就眾生。	行者爾時趣深寂定，放捨一切心意意識，將入涅槃，緣十方佛加被護念，興起智門，行者爾時於一念頃，淨佛國土，成就眾生。	001	At that time, the practitioner enters deep and tranquil concentration, letting go of all mind, thought, and cognition, about to enter nirvana. Relying on the empowerment and protection of the Buddhas of the ten directions, they give rise to the gate of wisdom. At that time, in a single thought, the practitioner purifies buddha-lands and accomplishes sentient beings.
['ZH_T47_1962_001:0082b26_1']	如何前四門所有功德，百千萬分不及其一。	如何前四門所有功德，百千萬分不及其一。	001	How can the merits and virtues of the previous four gates be even a hundredth, a thousandth, or a ten-thousandth part of this?

Because the Buddhas observe and protect, one has fully plumbed the depths of the source of the Buddhadharma. Because the causes and conditions of Samantabhadra's vows are completely fulfilled, and due to the power of original vows, and because the Dharma is like this, this is the gate of the spontaneous interpenetration of the nature of dharmas.

Contemplating the three characteristics of the faculties, objects, and their relationship, which are in constant flux, newly arising and ceasing, moment by moment, not abiding, analyzing until they are empty, with no Buddha and no thoughts, is the Hīnayāna of the Tripiṭaka Teaching.

Delusively thinking the mind arises, the mind actually does not arise. Arising has no inherent nature, its essence is emptiness. The Buddha's appearance contemplated is like an image in a mirror, a flower in the sky. No Buddha, no recollection. This is the great vehicle of the Shared Teaching.

Profoundly penetrating the shallow and deep, immeasurable names and appearances, like contemplating in the palm of one's hand. Clearly knowing this mind has the Tathagata-garbha. Passing through kalpas cutting off delusions, one then realizes the eternal truth. Separating from extremes to reveal the middle. No Buddha, no recollection. This is the great vehicle of the Distinct Teaching.

Whether it is the faculties or objects, they are all the arising of the Dharma realm. A single thought is also like this. The Buddhas of the dust realms are illuminated in a single thought. The sentient beings of the six paths are universally responded to in an instant. The beginning is the same as the end. Now I am just beginning to realize it, like a person with great blessings who holds a stone and turns it into a treasure. There is definitely no thought of abandoning it and seeking liberation from thoughts elsewhere. Within the boundaries is the middle. There are no Buddhas and no thoughts. This is the great vehicle of the perfect teaching. The Sutra of the Jeweled Necklace clarifies the sudden realization of the Tathāgata. This is what it refers to.
