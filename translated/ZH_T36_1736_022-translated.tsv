['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168b02_3']	然此二疑文即影略，實即二人俱有此疑，故云純陀有二種疑。	然此二疑文即影略，實即二人俱有此疑，故云純陀有二種疑。	022	However, these two doubts are actually both present in the two people, as the text is concise, so it is said that Pure Gift has two kinds of doubts.

['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168b04_14']	佛本不見佛性，後見佛性而得常住，豈非本無今有。	佛本不見佛性，後見佛性而得常住，豈非本無今有。	022	The Buddha originally did not see the Buddha-nature, but later saw the Buddha-nature and attained eternal abiding, isn't this originally not having but now having?
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168b05_6']	本無今有，即是生法。	本無今有，即是生法。	022	Originally not having but now having is precisely the dharma of arising.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168b05_16']	生法必滅，故是無常。	生法必滅，故是無常。	022	The dharma of arising will definitely cease, so it is impermanent.

Whether one accords with it or not, there are distinctions. The highest capacity, upon hearing once, both doubts are suddenly dispelled. The middling and lower capacities have not yet awakened.

In the chapter on pure conduct, due to the question of non-attainment, the Buddha raises eight sections. In the eight sections, it is concluded that for one who exists in the three times, this is not the case. This is non-attainment.

['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168b29_2']	按十七經，本有今有皆約於妄故，本無今無並約於真故，故云我本有煩惱、今無涅槃，本無般若、今有煩惱。	按十七經，本有今有皆約於妄故，本無今無並約於真故，故云我本有煩惱、今無涅槃，本無般若、今有煩惱。	022	According to the seventeenth sūtra, both the originally existent and the presently existent are about delusion, while both the originally nonexistent and the presently nonexistent are about the true. Therefore, it says, I originally had afflictions and now have no nirvāṇa, originally had no prajñā and now have afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168b29_7']	所以爾者？	所以爾者？	022	Why is it so?
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168b29_13']	約佛昔因故。	約佛昔因故。	022	It is because it is about the Buddha's past causes.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c02_8']	及二十七經，則云眾生過去有斷煩惱因緣，今見佛性，則是真法本無今有。	及二十七經，則云眾生過去有斷煩惱因緣，今見佛性，則是真法本無今有。	022	And the twenty-seventh sūtra says, Sentient beings have in the past severed the causes of afflictions, and now see the Buddha-nature, which is the true Dharma that was originally nonexistent but now exists.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c03_11']	故純陀生疑，正約世尊因見佛性本無今有為難。	故純陀生疑，正約世尊因見佛性本無今有為難。	022	Therefore, Cunda gives rise to doubts, which are precisely about the World-Honored One's seeing the Buddha-nature that was originally nonexistent but now exists.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c05_14']	是知若真若妄，皆通本有今無、本無今有，故疏取經意及彼論意，故約生佛相望真妄並說。	是知若真若妄，皆通本有今無、本無今有，故疏取經意及彼論意，故約生佛相望真妄並說。	022	One should know that whether true or false, they both have the originally existent and presently nonexistent, and the originally nonexistent and presently existent. Therefore, the commentary takes the meaning of the sūtra and the meaning of the treatise, and discusses both the true and false in terms of the comparison between sentient beings and Buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c06_13']	又十七經約佛昔說故，即以佛昔時為本。	又十七經約佛昔說故，即以佛昔時為本。	022	Moreover, the seventeenth sūtra is about the Buddha's past teachings, so it takes the Buddha's past time as the original.

['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c10_2']	今疏取意，則以昔為本，現在為今。	今疏取意，則以昔為本，現在為今。	022	Now, the commentary takes the meaning to be that the past is the basis, and the present is the present.

['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c13_7']	言眾生則本無今有者，約性淨故本無煩惱，約客塵故今有煩惱。	言眾生則本無今有者，約性淨故本無煩惱，約客塵故今有煩惱。	022	As for saying that sentient beings originally did not have afflictions but now do, it is because from the perspective of their pure nature, they originally had no afflictions, but from the perspective of their adventitious defilements, they now have afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c16_2']	疏「菩提則眾生本有今無」者，亦約性淨菩提本有，今為客塵之所覆故，迷真起妄，無有證得圓淨菩提，故云今無耳。	疏「菩提則眾生本有今無」者，亦約性淨菩提本有，今為客塵之所覆故，迷真起妄，無有證得圓淨菩提，故云今無耳。	022	The commentary says, As for bodhi, sentient beings originally had it but now do not, it also refers to the bodhi of pure nature, which originally existed, but now it is covered by adventitious defilements, so they are deluded about the truth and give rise to falsehood, and there is no realization of perfect and pure bodhi, so it is said that they now do not have it.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c17_17']	言「諸佛則本無今有」者，約圓淨菩提，昔未修成故云本無，今已修得故云今有。	言「諸佛則本無今有」者，約圓淨菩提，昔未修成故云本無，今已修得故云今有。	022	As for saying that buddhas originally did not have it but now do, it refers to the perfect and pure bodhi, which was not cultivated and accomplished in the past, so it is said that they originally did not have it, but now that it has been cultivated and attained, it is said that they now have it.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c18_8']	上來已顯彼偈上半。	上來已顯彼偈上半。	022	The above has already revealed the first half of the verse.

['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c21_12']	今疏以第三句總牒三世，第四句遣之，故云下半顯性。	今疏以第三句總牒三世，第四句遣之，故云下半顯性。	022	Now the commentary takes the third sentence as a general reference to the three times, and the fourth sentence dismisses them, so it says the second half reveals the nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c22_3']	取文小異，全是論意。	取文小異，全是論意。	022	The text is slightly different, but it is entirely the meaning of the treatise.

['ZH_T36_1736_022:0168c23_3']	謂迷時有妄，非是無真；	謂迷時有妄，非是無真；	022	It means that when deluded, there is delusion, but it is not that there is no true nature;
