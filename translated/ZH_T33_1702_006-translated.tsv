['ZH_T33_1702_006:0218b16_6']	則嚴與不嚴等無有二，是真嚴也。	則嚴與不嚴等無有二，是真嚴也。	006	Then adorning and not adorning are equal and non-dual, which is true adornment.

['ZH_T33_1702_006:0218b23_19']	以彼文云無發菩提心者，佛意但是拂於我人之心，不是泯於菩薩。	以彼文云無發菩提心者，佛意但是拂於我人之心，不是泯於菩薩。	006	Because the text says there are no one who gives rise to the mind of enlightenment, the Buddha's intention is merely to brush away the mind of self and person, not to eliminate the bodhisattva.
['ZH_T33_1702_006:0218b27_4']	空生不達此意，將謂我人與菩薩不異，由是空生起疑之處則云若無菩薩，如來斷疑之處則言無人，彼此媕含未嘗顯說，直至此處方乃㳏通。	空生不達此意，將謂我人與菩薩不異，由是空生起疑之處則云若無菩薩，如來斷疑之處則言無人，彼此媕含未嘗顯說，直至此處方乃㳏通。	006	Subhūti did not understand this intention and thought that self, person, and bodhisattva are no different. Therefore, where Subhūti gives rise to doubt, he says if there are no bodhisattvas, and where the Tathāgata resolves the doubt, he says there are no people.
