['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b12_3']	「不思議因緣利物之疾」者，因緣秖是感應耳。	「不思議因緣利物之疾」者，因緣秖是感應耳。	009	The swiftness of benefiting beings through inconceivable causes and conditions means that causes and conditions are simply the response to stimuli.

The principle must be combined with half of the chapter on the Buddha's Land. Discussing it in a general way, it is therefore simply said to be four.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b18_8']	「故方便」下，三、正當三觀。	「故方便」下，三、正當三觀。	009	Therefore, skillful means and below are the three correct contemplations.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b20_8']	〈方便品〉約所用法正多屬空，〈弟子〉、〈菩薩〉約能訶法，而弟子多屬假，以菩薩多屬中，佛國具三。	〈方便品〉約所用法正多屬空，〈弟子〉、〈菩薩〉約能訶法，而弟子多屬假，以菩薩多屬中，佛國具三。	009	In the chapter on skillful means, the main focus is on emptiness in terms of the methods used. In the chapters on disciples and bodhisattvas, the focus is on the methods of reprimanding. The disciples mainly belong to the provisional, while the bodhisattvas mainly belong to the middle. The Buddha's lands embody all three.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b20_18']	三觀既爾，四教準知。	三觀既爾，四教準知。	009	Since the three contemplations are like this, the four teachings can be understood accordingly.

['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b22_8']	二、解釋，三：	二、解釋，三：	009	Second, the explanation, in three:
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b22_19']	初、此品成上從假入空。	初、此品成上從假入空。	009	First, this chapter completes the above entry into emptiness from the provisional.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b22_23']	荊溪云：	荊溪云：	009	The Jingxi says:
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b23_9']	而云成者，即釋成也。	而云成者，即釋成也。	009	And it says completion because it explains and completes.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b24_5']	上所明空既空一切，即是皆空故也。	上所明空既空一切，即是皆空故也。	009	The emptiness that was clarified above is already empty of everything, so it is all empty.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b25_1']	「應具假中而但云空」者，此有二意：	「應具假中而但云空」者，此有二意：	009	It should be equipped with the provisional and the middle, but only speaks of emptiness has two meanings:
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b25_15']	一者通途虛照三諦，雖三而空。	一者通途虛照三諦，雖三而空。	009	First, the general illumination of the three truths is empty even though there are three.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b27_8']	二者由在方等教中，雖三而通，故使通相復異次第，未是獨顯，但是通知。	二者由在方等教中，雖三而通，故使通相復異次第，未是獨顯，但是通知。	009	Second, because it is in the Vaipulya teachings, although there are three, they are all-pervasive, causing the common characteristics to differ from the sequence, it is not yet exclusively revealed, it is just knowing through commonality.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b28_8']	若爾，空尚未委，況今於空加四無量及廣上等？	若爾，空尚未委，況今於空加四無量及廣上等？	009	If so, emptiness has not yet been fully understood, let alone now adding the four immeasurables and expanding on the above, etc., in emptiness?
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825b28_13']	故云小異。	故云小異。	009	Therefore, it is said to be slightly different.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c01_2']	是故今以三品釋上〈觀眾生〉中有假有中，故云約空起四無量。	是故今以三品釋上〈觀眾生〉中有假有中，故云約空起四無量。	009	Therefore, now using the three categories to explain the above Contemplating Sentient Beings has provisional existence and real existence in the middle, therefore it is said to arise from emptiness and cultivate the four immeasurables.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c01_17']	義當假觀，含於空中，故云約空。	義當假觀，含於空中，故云約空。	009	The meaning corresponds to the contemplation of the provisional, which includes emptiness and the middle, therefore it is said to be based on emptiness.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c02_15']	若準此文，窮眾生源，義當中在空中意也。	若準此文，窮眾生源，義當中在空中意也。	009	If based on this text, exhausting the source of sentient beings, the meaning is in the middle of emptiness.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c03_12']	「淨名答」等者，源者即是無住之源本也。	「淨名答」等者，源者即是無住之源本也。	009	The answer of Vimalakīrti and so forth, the source is precisely the original source of non-abiding.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c04_14']	尚至無住，豈但空耶，二，佛道品成上從空入假。	尚至無住，豈但空耶，二，佛道品成上從空入假。	009	It has already reached non-abiding, how could it just be emptiness? Second, the chapter on the Buddha's path completes the above entering the provisional from emptiness.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c04_18']	荊溪云：	荊溪云：	009	Jingxi says:
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c05_19']	次〈佛道品〉既辨假中，任運變成不思議之假中也。	次〈佛道品〉既辨假中，任運變成不思議之假中也。	009	Next, the chapter on the Buddha's path, since it distinguishes the provisional and the middle, it naturally transforms into the inconceivable provisional and middle.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c06_13']	文中雖不彰灼言之，道理應爾。	文中雖不彰灼言之，道理應爾。	009	Although the text does not explicitly state it, the principle should be so.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c08_4']	雖然，此乃從於教旨以說顯機，乃須依附方等故分三品以屬三觀。	雖然，此乃從於教旨以說顯機，乃須依附方等故分三品以屬三觀。	009	Nevertheless, this is based on the teaching's purport to explain the manifest capacities, which must rely on the Vaipulya, thus dividing into three grades and belonging to the three contemplations.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c08_22']	三、〈不二〉、〈香積〉兩品成上中道。	三、〈不二〉、〈香積〉兩品成上中道。	009	The two chapters Non-duality and Fragrance Accumulation complete the middle way above.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c09_1']	荊溪云：	荊溪云：	009	Jingxi says:
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c11_7']	如我病者等者，能見斯病與空同體，故中雙非病，亦雙非非俗，故非有非真故非無，此則正當中道義也。	如我病者等者，能見斯病與空同體，故中雙非病，亦雙非非俗，故非有非真故非無，此則正當中道義也。	009	As for the sick person, etc., one can see that this sickness and emptiness have the same essence, so the middle way is neither sickness nor both negations. It is also not the conventional, so it is neither existent nor true, so it is not nonexistent. This is precisely the meaning of the middle way.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c11_18']	二、遠成室外四品，二：	二、遠成室外四品，二：	009	Second, the four chapters outside the room are completed in the distance, two:

['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c13_6']	二、〈佛道品〉成上〈弟子品〉。	二、〈佛道品〉成上〈弟子品〉。	009	Second, the chapter on the Buddha's path completes the chapter on disciples above.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c13_25']	三、〈不二〉、〈香積〉成上〈菩薩品〉。	三、〈不二〉、〈香積〉成上〈菩薩品〉。	009	Third, the two chapters Non-duality and Fragrance Accumulation complete the chapter on bodhisattvas above.

['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c16_11']	自之與他等者，應先了心，方知生佛。	自之與他等者，應先了心，方知生佛。	009	As for self and others, etc., one should first understand the mind, and then know the buddhas and sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c17_18']	初既了矣，反後照時但照一邊，無不具足，故今但云觀眾生耳。	初既了矣，反後照時但照一邊，無不具足，故今但云觀眾生耳。	009	Since the beginning has already been understood, when one turns to illuminate later, one only illuminates one side, which is complete, so now it only says to contemplate sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c20_2']	此意正顯空之與中，故先引《華嚴》自他雙顯，還依方等且從於通，故釋觀達觀穿之文皆空三諦。	此意正顯空之與中，故先引《華嚴》自他雙顯，還依方等且從於通，故釋觀達觀穿之文皆空三諦。	009	This meaning correctly reveals emptiness and the middle, so it first cites the Huayan Sutra to show self and others together, and still relies on the Vaipulya to follow the general, so the explanation of the contemplation, the penetrating contemplation, and the text are all the three emptinesses.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c21_2']	「慈悲接物」者，物即眾生，以從利他故觀他也。	「慈悲接物」者，物即眾生，以從利他故觀他也。	009	Compassion and mercy connect with beings means that beings are sentient beings, and because they follow benefiting others, one contemplates others.
['ZH_T38_1779_009:0825c21_12']	利他之法，指四無量。	利他之法，指四無量。	009	The method of benefiting others refers to the four immeasurable [minds].
