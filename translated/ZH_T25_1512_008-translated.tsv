['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a16_0']	疑分中第五段經文。此所以來者，有疑故來	疑分中第五段經文。此所以來者，有疑故來	008	Subhūti, what do you think? Does the Tathāgata have a flesh eye? and so forth, this is the fifth section of the sutra text in the part on resolving doubts. The reason it appears here is because there are doubts,
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a17_1']	也。	也。	008	so it comes.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a17_5']	云何疑？	云何疑？	008	What are the doubts?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a20_15']	上第三段經云「菩薩不見彼是眾生、我為菩薩」，即此斷疑分中前第四經言「菩薩不見眾生，亦不見清淨國土」，又挍量分中亦云以不見眾生等法，名諸佛如來。	上第三段經云「菩薩不見彼是眾生、我為菩薩」，即此斷疑分中前第四經言「菩薩不見眾生，亦不見清淨國土」，又挍量分中亦云以不見眾生等法，名諸佛如來。	008	In the third section of the sutra above, it says The bodhisattva does not see them as sentient beings, but as himself being a bodhisattva. In this part on resolving doubts, the fourth sutra before this says The bodhisattva does not see sentient beings, nor does he see a pure land. The section on comparison also says that using the fact that one does not see dharmas such as sentient beings is what is called the buddhas and tathāgatas.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a22_10']	而此菩薩、眾生、佛、淨土等四，前已了了解釋，明此四名雖異，皆依真如故有。	而此菩薩、眾生、佛、淨土等四，前已了了解釋，明此四名雖異，皆依真如故有。	008	However, these four - bodhisattva, sentient beings, buddha, and pure land - have already been clearly explained before. It is made clear that although these four names are different, they all exist based on suchness.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a24_3']	若離真如法界，於有為虛妄法中謂更有此四法可見者，非是菩薩；	若離真如法界，於有為虛妄法中謂更有此四法可見者，非是菩薩；	008	If one were to leave the dharma realm of suchness and say that there are these four dharmas to be seen within conditioned and false dharmas, then one is not a bodhisattva.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a25_3']	若解不異真如而見此四者，名真菩薩也。	若解不異真如而見此四者，名真菩薩也。	008	If one understands that the true nature of phenomena is not different from suchness and sees these four, one is called a true bodhisattva.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a26_12']	雖爾了了解釋有無之義，然眾生復乘無生，或更起異疑，云：	雖爾了了解釋有無之義，然眾生復乘無生，或更起異疑，云：	008	Although it is so, one should understand the meaning of existence and non-existence. However, sentient beings may again give rise to different doubts while riding the unborn, thinking:
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852a29_4', 'ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b01_1']	若不見諸法名為諸佛者，或謂諸佛法身是以依身故有五眼，若無法身便應無五眼，若無五眼則不見諸法。🔽未知今言不見者，為有五眼故不見？	若不見諸法名為諸佛者，或謂諸佛法身是以依身故有五眼，若無法身便應無五眼，若無五眼則不見諸法。 未知今言不見者，為有五眼故不見？	008	If not seeing phenomena is called being a buddha, then it may be said that the Dharma body of buddhas exists based on the physical body, and therefore there are five eyes. If there were no Dharma body, there would be no five eyes. If there were no five eyes, then one would not see phenomena.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b01_10']	為無五眼故不見也？	為無五眼故不見也？	008	It is not yet known whether the present statement of non-seeing is due to having the five eyes or not having the five eyes.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b02_8']	若有五眼者，為當前法是無故所以不見？	若有五眼者，為當前法是無故所以不見？	008	If there are five eyes, is it because the phenomena are non-existent that one does not see them?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b03_2']	為當前境實有而言不見也？	為當前境實有而言不見也？	008	Or is it that the present object actually exists but is said to be unseen?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b03_16']	為斷此疑故，以此五眼經答也。	為斷此疑故，以此五眼經答也。	008	In order to resolve this doubt, this sūtra on the five eyes is given as the answer.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b05_2']	答意明如來具足五眼，有無斯照，隨法虛實皆如實智知。	答意明如來具足五眼，有無斯照，隨法虛實皆如實智知。	008	The meaning of the answer clarifies that the Tathāgata is fully endowed with the five eyes, illuminating existence and non-existence, and with the wisdom of suchness, he knows the truth and falsity of phenomena.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b06_4']	今言不見者，有眼故云不見，非無眼言不見也。	今言不見者，有眼故云不見，非無眼言不見也。	008	Now, when it is said that they are not seen, it is because they have eyes that they are said not to see, not because they are eyeless that they are said not to see.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b06_16']	若有眼者，何故言不見有？	若有眼者，何故言不見有？	008	If they have eyes, why is it said that they are not seen to exist?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b07_8']	但前境虛妄無法可見也。	但前境虛妄無法可見也。	008	It is just that the objects before them are false and nonexistent, and thus cannot be seen.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b07_14']	不見有二種：	不見有二種：	008	Not seeing has two kinds:
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b08_18']	一、真如平等理中不見眾生等四條然有異，故言不見；	一、真如平等理中不見眾生等四條然有異，故言不見；	008	First, within the principle of the equality of suchness, one does not see the four aspects such as sentient beings, etc., because there are differences, it is said that they are not seen;
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b10_5']	二、眾生五陰虛妄法體本來不生古今空寂，故無法可見。	二、眾生五陰虛妄法體本來不生古今空寂，故無法可見。	008	Second, the five aggregates and false dharmas of sentient beings are originally unborn, and have been empty and quiescent from the beginning, thus there are no dharmas that can be seen.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b11_12']	此二明理中絕相故，聖人無有取相分別之見，故云不見也。	此二明理中絕相故，聖人無有取相分別之見，故云不見也。	008	These two clarify that within principle, characteristics are severed, thus the sages have no seeing of grasping characteristics and discrimination, thus it is said that they are not seen.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b12_18']	所以得言見者，如來具二諦智，如虛妄而知、如實而見也。	所以得言見者，如來具二諦智，如虛妄而知、如實而見也。	008	The reason it can be said that they are seen is that the Tathāgata is endowed with the wisdom of the two truths, knowing as they are false, seeing as they are real.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b14_4']	此就諸法空寂義邊故言不見，非謂眼境並無令不見也。	此就諸法空寂義邊故言不見，非謂眼境並無令不見也。	008	This is based on the meaning of the emptiness and quiescence of all dharmas, thus it is said that they are not seen, it does not mean that because the objects of the eyes do not exist, they are not seen.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b15_9']	若爾，那得聞言不見，便謂諸佛菩薩一向無眼不見諸法？	若爾，那得聞言不見，便謂諸佛菩薩一向無眼不見諸法？	008	If that is so, how can one hear the words not seeing and immediately say that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not have eyes and do not see all dharmas?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b15_13']	次明也。	次明也。	008	Next, it is clarified.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b17_5']	「如來有肉眼」者，何者是肉眼所知境界，而言如來有肉眼？	「如來有肉眼」者，何者是肉眼所知境界，而言如來有肉眼？	008	The Tathāgata has a flesh eye - what are the objects known by the flesh eye, and why is it said that the Tathāgata has a flesh eye?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b18_11']	明凡夫之人肉眼，但見因緣和合虛妄境界，見上不見下。	明凡夫之人肉眼，但見因緣和合虛妄境界，見上不見下。	008	It is explained that ordinary people's flesh eyes only see false objects that are a combination of causes and conditions, seeing above but not below.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b21_7']	然眾生造業既殊，報得肉眼亦差品不同，或但見障內不見障外、或內外俱見，或晝見夜不見、或夜見晝不見、或晝夜俱見。	然眾生造業既殊，報得肉眼亦差品不同，或但見障內不見障外、或內外俱見，或晝見夜不見、或夜見晝不見、或晝夜俱見。	008	However, since sentient beings create karma differently, the flesh eyes they obtain as retribution also vary in quality, with some only seeing inside but not outside, some seeing both inside and outside, some seeing during the day but not at night, some seeing at night but not during the day, and some seeing both day and night.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b21_20']	此等諸眼，皆是父母所生眼。	此等諸眼，皆是父母所生眼。	008	These various eyes are all eyes born from parents.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b23_3']	如弗婆提人，以父母所生眼，能見障外色，前後俱見。	如弗婆提人，以父母所生眼，能見障外色，前後俱見。	008	Like the people of Pūrvavideha, with the eyes born from their parents, they can see forms outside of obstructions, seeing both in front and behind simultaneously.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b24_5']	如來同凡夫見此虛妄之色故，云如來有肉眼也。	如來同凡夫見此虛妄之色故，云如來有肉眼也。	008	The Tathāgata sees these false forms as ordinary people do, and therefore it is said that the Tathāgata has a flesh eye.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b24_20']	「如來有天眼」者，天眼有二種：	「如來有天眼」者，天眼有二種：	008	As for the Tathāgata has a divine eye, there are two kinds of divine eyes:
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b25_8']	一者修得、二者報得。	一者修得、二者報得。	008	one is attained through cultivation, and the other is attained through karmic retribution.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b25_18']	何者是天眼所知境界？	何者是天眼所知境界？	008	What are the objects known by the divine eye?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b27_15']	天眼亦照因緣和合虛妄境界，皆見障外之色，亦有見下不見上者、有見前不見後。	天眼亦照因緣和合虛妄境界，皆見障外之色，亦有見下不見上者、有見前不見後。	008	The divine eye also illuminates the false objects of the combination of causes and conditions, and all sees forms outside of obstructions. There are those who see below but not above, and those who see in front but not behind.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852b28_17']	若因他力，見上見下、見前見後，有四方俱見。	若因他力，見上見下、見前見後，有四方俱見。	008	If it is through the power of others, one sees above and below, in front and behind, and there are those who see all four directions.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c01_15']	明如來所見亦同凡夫顛倒取境，如來稱前境虛實而緣，以此為異，故言如來有天眼也。	明如來所見亦同凡夫顛倒取境，如來稱前境虛實而緣，以此為異，故言如來有天眼也。	008	It is clear that what the Tathāgata sees is the same as the inverted grasping of objects by ordinary people. The Tathāgata accords with the reality or falsity of the objects in front, and this is the difference, and therefore it is said that the Tathāgata has a divine eye.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c04_4']	然世間人，有報得肉眼、有報得天眼，亦有修得天眼者，此皆三界中法，明諸佛菩薩道超世表，久已無此二眼。	然世間人，有報得肉眼、有報得天眼，亦有修得天眼者，此皆三界中法，明諸佛菩薩道超世表，久已無此二眼。	008	However, worldly people have the flesh eye obtained through retribution, the heavenly eye obtained through retribution, and also the heavenly eye obtained through cultivation. These are all dharmas within the three realms. It is clear that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas' path transcends the world and has long been free from these two eyes.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c04_16']	何故道言如來有此二眼者？	何故道言如來有此二眼者？	008	Why then is it said that the Tathāgata has these two eyes?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c05_12']	以見同二眼故，言如來有天眼也。	以見同二眼故，言如來有天眼也。	008	Because the seeing is the same as the two eyes, it is said that the Tathāgata has the heavenly eye.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c06_17']	「如來有慧眼」者，何者是慧眼所緣境？	「如來有慧眼」者，何者是慧眼所緣境？	008	As for the Tathāgata has the eye of wisdom, what is the object of the eye of wisdom?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c08_10']	明慧眼知一切有為法無為法、有漏無漏、善惡無記等法，而不作念我知此法。	明慧眼知一切有為法無為法、有漏無漏、善惡無記等法，而不作念我知此法。	008	It is clear that the eye of wisdom knows all conditioned and unconditioned dharmas, contaminated and uncontaminated, wholesome, unwholesome, and indeterminate dharmas, but does not think, I know these dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c09_11']	明如來亦同二乘所緣法故，言如來有慧眼也。	明如來亦同二乘所緣法故，言如來有慧眼也。	008	It is clear that the Tathāgata is also the same as the two vehicles in terms of the objects of dharmas, so it is said that the Tathāgata has the eye of wisdom.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c10_18']	「如來有法眼」者，何者是法眼所緣境界？	「如來有法眼」者，何者是法眼所緣境界？	008	As for the Tathāgata has the Dharma eye, what is the object of the Dharma eye?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c12_2']	明法眼能知三乘聖人當證果時，乘何等心證於道果。	明法眼能知三乘聖人當證果時，乘何等心證於道果。	008	It is clear that the Dharma eye is able to know when the sages of the three vehicles are about to realize the fruit, by what kind of mind they realize the fruit of the path.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c13_10']	如此法眼所緣證法差別，如來亦同見之，故言如來有法眼也。	如此法眼所緣證法差別，如來亦同見之，故言如來有法眼也。	008	The Dharma eye's objects of perception and realization of the distinctions in dharmas are also seen in the same way by the Tathāgata, and therefore it is said that the Tathāgata has the Dharma eye.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c14_14']	「如來有佛眼」者，然上之四眼，見境不周，知法不盡故。	「如來有佛眼」者，然上之四眼，見境不周，知法不盡故。	008	As for the Tathāgata has the Buddha eye, the above four eyes do not fully encompass the seen realms and do not exhaustively know the dharmas.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c15_4']	設所知見，不能明了。	設所知見，不能明了。	008	Even if they know and see, they are not able to clearly understand.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c17_4']	明佛眼所見，真俗並照，巨細斯鑒，一切萬法了了通達，無境不周、無法不盡，故名佛眼。	明佛眼所見，真俗並照，巨細斯鑒，一切萬法了了通達，無境不周、無法不盡，故名佛眼。	008	It is explained that what is seen by the Buddha eye illuminates both the true and the conventional, and it discerns the vast and the minute. It thoroughly penetrates all myriad dharmas, with no realm not encompassed and no dharma not exhausted, and is therefore called the Buddha eye.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c17_18']	此眼如來有五眼，故有境之見。	此眼如來有五眼，故有境之見。	008	The Tathāgata has these five eyes, and therefore he has the seeing of the realms.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c19_5']	既有此眼，故知佛有身有眼言不見，非無身無眼言不見故。	既有此眼，故知佛有身有眼言不見，非無身無眼言不見故。	008	Since he has these eyes, it is known that the Buddha has a body and eyes, and it is not that he does not see because he has no body and no eyes.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c19_14']	次明此五眼經文也。	次明此五眼經文也。	008	Next, it clarifies the text of this sūtra on the five eyes.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c20_6']	乘五眼經文，復更生疑。	乘五眼經文，復更生疑。	008	Relying on the sūtra text on the five eyes, further doubts arise.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c20_9']	疑云：	疑云：	008	The doubts are as follows:
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c22_17']	十方世界無量無邊，直三千世界中所有種種諸法尚不可知盡，況無邊世界中亦有種種諸法，何故但明此五眼？	十方世界無量無邊，直三千世界中所有種種諸法尚不可知盡，況無邊世界中亦有種種諸法，何故但明此五眼？	008	The worlds in the ten directions are immeasurable and boundless. Even the various dharmas within the three thousand worlds alone are still unknowable and inexhaustible, let alone the various dharmas within the boundless worlds. Why then only clarify these five eyes?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c24_1']	若正有此五眼是為如來，則知法不盡、見境不周。	若正有此五眼是為如來，則知法不盡、見境不周。	008	If the Tathāgata only has these five eyes, then it would mean that he does not know all dharmas and does not see the entire realm.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c25_14']	故引恒河沙喻以答此疑，欲明如來雖但有五眼，而照所知之境莫不皆盡。	故引恒河沙喻以答此疑，欲明如來雖但有五眼，而照所知之境莫不皆盡。	008	Therefore, he cites the analogy of the sands of the Ganges River to answer this doubt, wishing to clarify that although the Tathāgata only has five eyes, there is nothing that is not exhausted in the realm that he illuminates.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c26_8']	然知境雖盡，不可俱障於文。	然知境雖盡，不可俱障於文。	008	However, although the realm is exhausted, it cannot all be obstructed in the text.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0852c29_4']	且境中微細難知者不過心法故，舉恒沙世界中眾生，一眾生身中有善心不善心無記心、有漏無漏三三等心數不可限量。	且境中微細難知者不過心法故，舉恒沙世界中眾生，一眾生身中有善心不善心無記心、有漏無漏三三等心數不可限量。	008	Moreover, the subtle and difficult-to-know dharmas within the realm are no more than mental phenomena. Therefore, he mentions the minds of sentient beings in worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. Each sentient being has wholesome minds, unwholesome minds, indeterminate minds, contaminated minds, uncontaminated minds, the three groups of three minds, and so on, which are immeasurable.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a03_8']	一眾生有若干種心，恒沙世界眾生各有爾許心數差別不同，如來以三達靈知於一念中朗照故，不應難云若如來但有五眼則知境不盡也。	一眾生有若干種心，恒沙世界眾生各有爾許心數差別不同，如來以三達靈知於一念中朗照故，不應難云若如來但有五眼則知境不盡也。	008	One sentient being has several kinds of minds, and the sentient beings in the worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges each have that many different kinds of minds. The Tathāgata illuminates them all in a single thought with the spiritual knowledge of the three insights. Therefore, it is not appropriate to argue that if the Tathāgata only has the five eyes, then his knowledge of objects is incomplete.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a04_3']	此明眼雖有五，而知境斯盡也。	此明眼雖有五，而知境斯盡也。	008	This clarifies that although the eyes are five, the knowledge of objects is complete.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a05_3']	「佛言：	「佛言：	008	The Buddha said:
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a05_7']	須菩提！	須菩提！	008	Subhūti!

['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a07_1']	如恒河中所有沙，佛說是沙不」者，前舉五眼，明佛肉具能見之智。	如恒河中所有沙，佛說是沙不」者，前舉五眼，明佛肉具能見之智。	008	Are the sands in the Ganges called sands by the Buddha? Previously, the five eyes were mentioned, clarifying the Buddha's fleshly ability to see and know.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a08_9']	然智不孤起必知境，今將明五眼所知之境，故佛問須菩提：	然智不孤起必知境，今將明五眼所知之境，故佛問須菩提：	008	However, knowledge does not arise alone, it must know objects. Now, in order to clarify the objects known by the five eyes, the Buddha asked Subhūti:
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a09_13']	汝意地思惟籌量，謂如來知此恒河中沙頭數多少不也？	汝意地思惟籌量，謂如來知此恒河中沙頭數多少不也？	008	In your mind, do you think that the Tathāgata knows the number of sands in this Ganges River or not?
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a11_4']	應如是問，所以乃言如來說是沙不者，明理而言之要先知後說。	應如是問，所以乃言如來說是沙不者，明理而言之要先知後說。	008	One should ask in this way. The reason it says the Tathāgata says this is sand is to clarify that in principle, one must first know and then speak.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a12_10']	今言如來說者，明知如來知故方說，故云佛說是沙不也。	今言如來說者，明知如來知故方說，故云佛說是沙不也。	008	Now, saying the Tathāgata says clarifies that because the Tathāgata knows, he then speaks, so it says the Buddha says this is sand.
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a12_16']	「須菩提言：	「須菩提言：	008	Subhūti said:
['ZH_T25_1512_008:0853a12_19']	如是。	如是。	008	It is so.

['ZH_T25_1512_008:0855b25_7']	故即答「如來說具足色身」，此明三佛一義邊，即法身上有功德智慧二種莊嚴，真如解脫色萬德圓滿無所缺少。	故即答「如來說具足色身」，此明三佛一義邊，即法身上有功德智慧二種莊嚴，真如解脫色萬德圓滿無所缺少。	008	Therefore, it immediately answers, The Tathāgata speaks of the complete physical body.

['ZH_T25_1512_008:0855c16_13']	由有報、應故，不離法身有報、應之色，故言如來說名具足色身也。	由有報、應故，不離法身有報、應之色，故言如來說名具足色身也。	008	Because there is the physical body of retribution and response, it is not separate from the Dharma body having the physical body of retribution and response.

['ZH_T25_1512_008:0859a02_2']	「無有少法得三菩提」者，此是第一子句，明法身如來萬德圓滿無所缺減，雖在煩惱染法，於萬德中不少一法，非以修行因緣後方滿足故，得名為無上菩提，故云無少法得三菩提也。	「無有少法得三菩提」者，此是第一子句，明法身如來萬德圓滿無所缺減，雖在煩惱染法，於萬德中不少一法，非以修行因緣後方滿足故，得名為無上菩提，故云無少法得三菩提也。	008	There is not even a single dharma that attains supreme enlightenment is the first phrase, clarifying that the Tathāgata of the Dharma body is perfect in myriad virtues without any deficiency. Although dwelling in defiled dharmas of afflictions, not a single dharma is lacking among the myriad virtues. It is not that they are only fulfilled later through the causes and conditions of practice, and thus attain the name of unsurpassed enlightenment.

It is originally quiescent extinction, naturally free from hindrances, and all equal, without the concepts of self, person, etc. Unlike those below the stage of vajra, whose practice has shallow or deep levels and who have more or less afflictions to eliminate, thus their superiority or inferiority is different, so they give rise to arrogant thoughts, thinking My merits are many, and I have eliminated many afflictions, while they are inferior to me.
