['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a07_4']	5 五辯差別品第二之五今應思擇：	5 五辯差別品第二之五今應思擇：	Chapter 5, part 2: Distinctions in the five powers, now we should contemplate:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a08_7']	滅盡定中總滅一切心心所法，何緣唯說滅受想定？	滅盡定中總滅一切心心所法，何緣唯說滅受想定？	In the concentration of cessation, all mind and mental factors are completely extinguished. For what reason is it only said to extinguish the perception and conceptualization of the attainment of cessation?
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a08_17']	厭逆彼二，生此定故。	厭逆彼二，生此定故。	Because one enters this concentration in order to detest and oppose those two.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a09_16']	謂想與受，能為見愛雜染所依，故偏厭逆。	謂想與受，能為見愛雜染所依，故偏厭逆。	That is to say, perception and feeling are the basis for the defilements of views and craving, therefore one detests and opposes them.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a11_5']	如是二法多諸過患，如五蘊中已廣分別，故偏厭逆入滅盡定。	如是二法多諸過患，如五蘊中已廣分別，故偏厭逆入滅盡定。	These two dharmas have many faults, as has been extensively distinguished in the five aggregates, therefore one detests and opposes them and enters the concentration of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a11_10']	有餘師言：	有餘師言：	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a12_13']	諸相應法，若生若滅、若得若斷，如是等事無不同時。	諸相應法，若生若滅、若得若斷，如是等事無不同時。	For associated dharmas, whether arising or ceasing, whether obtained or cut off, such matters are never not simultaneous.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a13_12']	然說法者隨宜方便，以種種門差別而說。	然說法者隨宜方便，以種種門差別而說。	However, the expounders of the Dharma follow what is suitable and expedient, and explain them with various distinctions.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a15_19']	阿毘達磨唯依正理分別諸法性相義類，判決諸經意趣權實，不令如說定執非餘，由此應知諸經意趣。	阿毘達磨唯依正理分別諸法性相義類，判決諸經意趣權實，不令如說定執非餘，由此應知諸經意趣。	Abhidharma only relies on correct principles to distinguish the nature and characteristics of dharmas, and to determine the provisional and real meanings of the sutras, not allowing one to definitely grasp them as stated and not otherwise. Based on this, one should understand the meanings of the sutras.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a16_17']	如說此定識不離身，當知心所亦應不離。	如說此定識不離身，當知心所亦應不離。	As it is said that in this samādhi, consciousness is not separated from the body, one should know that the mental factors are also not separated.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a17_16']	如說此定諸意行滅，當知此中心亦應滅。	如說此定諸意行滅，當知此中心亦應滅。	As it is said that in this samādhi, all mental activities cease, one should know that the mind should also cease in this.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a18_7']	如斯影論，餘經亦有。	如斯影論，餘經亦有。	There are also such shadow treatises in other sutras.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a19_14']	如言諸佛正等菩提皆不放逸以為根本，餘經復告阿難陀言：	如言諸佛正等菩提皆不放逸以為根本，餘經復告阿難陀言：	As it is said that the correct and equal enlightenment of all Buddhas is based on heedfulness, another sutra again tells Ānanda:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a20_4']	無上菩提由精進得。	無上菩提由精進得。	Unsurpassed enlightenment is attained through diligence.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a20_18']	如說智慧能害煩惱，餘經復言：	如說智慧能害煩惱，餘經復言：	As it is said that wisdom can destroy afflictions, another sutra again says:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a21_12']	修無常想能斷欲貪，乃至廣說。	修無常想能斷欲貪，乃至廣說。	Cultivating the notion of impermanence can eliminate desire and greed, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a22_2']	譬喻論者作如是言：	譬喻論者作如是言：	The proponents of analogy say this:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a24_14']	滅盡定中唯滅受想，以定無有無心有情滅定命終有差別故，經說入滅定識不離身故，又言壽煖識互不相離故。	滅盡定中唯滅受想，以定無有無心有情滅定命終有差別故，經說入滅定識不離身故，又言壽煖識互不相離故。	In the samādhi of cessation only feeling and conceptualization are extinguished, because in this samādhi there is no difference between the living being and the dead body, because a scripture says that consciousness does not leave the body, and because it is said that life, heat, and consciousness are mutually inseparable.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a25_12']	此說非理，以一切心皆與受想俱生滅故。	此說非理，以一切心皆與受想俱生滅故。	This explanation is unreasonable, because all minds are born and perish together with feeling and conceptualization.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a26_3']	有何至教證此義成？	有何至教證此義成？	What is the ultimate teaching that proves this?
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a26_8']	如契經說：	如契經說：	A scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a28_6']	眼及色為緣生於眼識，三和合觸，俱起受想思，如是乃至意及法為緣生於意識等。	眼及色為緣生於眼識，三和合觸，俱起受想思，如是乃至意及法為緣生於意識等。	The eye and form as conditions give rise to visual consciousness, and the union of the three is contact, which together with feeling, conceptualization, and volition arise simultaneously. This is so up to the point of the mental faculty and mental objects as conditions giving rise to mental consciousness, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a29_5']	曾無處言有第七識，可執彼識離受想生。	曾無處言有第七識，可執彼識離受想生。	There is never a place where it is said that there is a seventh consciousness that can be grasped as being born apart from feeling and conceptualization.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403a29_19']	又此定中所依滅故，能依亦滅。	又此定中所依滅故，能依亦滅。	Also, in this samādhi, the support is extinguished, and therefore the supported is extinguished.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b02_7']	非無所依，諸心所法可能獨生，是故此中諸心心所一切皆滅。	非無所依，諸心所法可能獨生，是故此中諸心心所一切皆滅。	There is no mental dharma that can be born alone without a support. Therefore all mind and mental activities are extinguished in this samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b04_8']	若謂此俱言顯無間起義，如曼馱多惡心起故俱時墮落，如不淨俱修念覺支，此亦應爾。	若謂此俱言顯無間起義，如曼馱多惡心起故俱時墮落，如不淨俱修念覺支，此亦應爾。	If you say that the word “together” means “immediately after,” as in the case of Mandhatar, who fell together with his evil thoughts, or as in the case of the cultivation of mindfulness and the factors of enlightenment together with impurity, then this is also so.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b04_18']	理必不然，有差別故。	理必不然，有差別故。	This is definitely not so, because there is a difference.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b06_13']	曼馱多等，契經俱言理實應顯無間起義，以非愛業與非愛果決定不應同時生故。	曼馱多等，契經俱言理實應顯無間起義，以非愛業與非愛果決定不應同時生故。	The word “together” in the case of Mandhatar and others really does mean “immediately after,” because evil karma and its evil results definitely should not arise simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b07_9']	又彼經說第五轉故，如彼經說：	又彼經說第五轉故，如彼經說：	Also, because the fifth transformation is mentioned in that scripture, as that scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b08_3']	曼馱多王惡心起故俱時墮落。	曼馱多王惡心起故俱時墮落。	“King Mandhatar, because of his evil thoughts, fell together with them.”
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b08_12']	此顯後時方墮落義。	此顯後時方墮落義。	This shows that he fell later.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b09_11']	不淨覺支，有漏無漏性差別故，起不同時。	不淨覺支，有漏無漏性差別故，起不同時。	The factors of enlightenment and impurity are of different natures, contaminated and uncontaminated, and therefore do not arise at the same time.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b10_1']	此經俱言顯同時起。	此經俱言顯同時起。	The word “together” in this scripture means arising simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b11_1']	聖教正理皆不相違，故此言俱非無間起。	聖教正理皆不相違，故此言俱非無間起。	Since this does not contradict the correct principles of the scriptures, this word “together” does not mean “immediately after.”
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b11_20']	又執俱言顯無間起，有不定過，如契經說：	又執俱言顯無間起，有不定過，如契經說：	Also, if you insist that the word “together” means “immediately after,” there is an indeterminate error, as a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b12_8']	樂俱喜俱四諦現觀。	樂俱喜俱四諦現觀。	The four truths are realized in succession with joy and pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b13_14']	不可復執此同曼馱多等經，謂樂喜無間方生四諦現觀。	不可復執此同曼馱多等經，謂樂喜無間方生四諦現觀。	One should not insist that this is the same as the sutra of Mandhatar, which states that the realization of the four truths occurs only after the succession of joy and pleasure.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b14_1']	又如經說：	又如經說：	Moreover, as the sutras say:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b14_15']	有貪心等，與貪俱故名有貪心。	有貪心等，與貪俱故名有貪心。	There is a mind with greed, etc., because it is associated with greed, it is called a mind with greed.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b16_12']	此不應執從貪無間所起之心名有貪心，如是便有太過之失，故此俱言顯同時義。	此不應執從貪無間所起之心名有貪心，如是便有太過之失，故此俱言顯同時義。	This should not be taken to mean that the mind that arises immediately after greed is called a mind with greed, as this would lead to the fault of over-extension. Therefore, the word together here indicates simultaneity.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b17_7']	又受想等依止心故，名為心所。	又受想等依止心故，名為心所。	Moreover, feeling, conception, etc. are called mental factors because they rely on the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b18_1']	離所依止，此受想等應不得生。	離所依止，此受想等應不得生。	Apart from the support, these feelings, conceptions, etc. would not be able to arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b19_8']	若謂心作等無間緣名所依者，心亦依心無間生故應名心所。	若謂心作等無間緣名所依者，心亦依心無間生故應名心所。	If it is said that the mind is the support because it acts as the immediately antecedent condition, then the mind should also be called a mental factor because it arises immediately after the mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b20_7']	又從心所無間生心，心所亦應成所依性。	又從心所無間生心，心所亦應成所依性。	Moreover, when the mind arises immediately after the mental factors, the mental factors should also be the supported nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b21_2']	如是等義，至六因中當更廣辯。	如是等義，至六因中當更廣辯。	These and other meanings will be further discussed in detail in the section on the six causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b21_7']	又契經說：	又契經說：	Moreover, the sutras say:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b21_17']	入滅定時，諸意行滅。	入滅定時，諸意行滅。	When entering the concentration of cessation, the activities of the mind cease.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b22_10']	故知滅定非但滅此受想二法。	故知滅定非但滅此受想二法。	Therefore we know that in this samādhi not only the two dharmas of feeling and conceptualization are extinguished.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b24_9']	又識相續，於此定中非暫滅者，決定應有所依所緣與識和合，離所依緣，識不生故。	又識相續，於此定中非暫滅者，決定應有所依所緣與識和合，離所依緣，識不生故。	Also, if the continuity of consciousness is not temporarily extinguished in this samādhi, it must definitely have a support, an object, and be combined with consciousness, because consciousness does not arise apart from its support and object.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b26_2']	既有三和必應有觸，與觸俱起有受想思，則滅定中受想二法亦應不滅。	既有三和必應有觸，與觸俱起有受想思，則滅定中受想二法亦應不滅。	Since there is the combination of the three, there must be contact. Together with contact, there are feeling, conceptualization, and volition. Then the two dharmas of feeling and conceptualization would also not be extinguished in the samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b27_19']	若謂如經說受緣愛，然阿羅漢雖有諸受而非愛緣，觸亦應爾，非一切觸皆生受等。	若謂如經說受緣愛，然阿羅漢雖有諸受而非愛緣，觸亦應爾，非一切觸皆生受等。	If it is said that, as the sūtras say, feeling is the condition for craving, but although arhats have feelings, they are not the condition for craving, contact should also be like this, and not all contacts give rise to feeling, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b28_9']	此例不然，有差別故。	此例不然，有差別故。	This example is not correct, because there is a distinction.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403b29_8']	經自簡言，若無明觸所生諸受，為緣生愛。	經自簡言，若無明觸所生諸受，為緣生愛。	The sūtras themselves distinguish and say, The feelings produced by contact associated with ignorance give rise to craving as a condition.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c01_6']	諸阿羅漢無無明觸，故雖有受而不生愛。	諸阿羅漢無無明觸，故雖有受而不生愛。	Arhats do not have the contact associated with ignorance, so although they have feelings, they do not give rise to craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c02_5']	曾無有處簡觸生受，故但有觸必生受等。	曾無有處簡觸生受，故但有觸必生受等。	There has never been a place that distinguishes contact giving rise to feeling, so it is only that when there is contact, feeling, etc. must arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c03_14']	有餘師說於滅定中雖有識體而無觸者，未知彼意執何為觸？	有餘師說於滅定中雖有識體而無觸者，未知彼意執何為觸？	Other masters say that although there is a substance of consciousness in samādhi, there is no contact. We do not know what they mean by contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c05_12']	然一切識必託所依所緣而起，所依緣識三法和合佛說為觸，由觸為緣生受想等。	然一切識必託所依所緣而起，所依緣識三法和合佛說為觸，由觸為緣生受想等。	However, all consciousnesses must be supported by a support and an object, and the union of the three dharmas of consciousness with its support and object is called contact by the Buddha. Contact as a condition gives rise to such things as feeling and conceptualization.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c06_12']	許滅定中有三和合，然說無觸，但有虛言。	許滅定中有三和合，然說無觸，但有虛言。	If you admit that there is a union of the three dharmas in samādhi, but say that there is no contact, then you are just indulging in empty words.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c07_19']	又滅定中唯有心者，應無思慮，以滅定中說諸意行悉皆滅故。	又滅定中唯有心者，應無思慮，以滅定中說諸意行悉皆滅故。	Also, if there is only mind in samādhi, there must be no thought, because in samādhi all activities of mind are said to be extinguished.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c09_7']	心若無思即無思慮，無思慮心，同所不許，心有作業皆由思故。	心若無思即無思慮，無思慮心，同所不許，心有作業皆由思故。	If mind is without thought, then it is without thought and deliberation. A mind without thought and deliberation is the same as what you do not admit, because all mental activity is due to thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c09_17']	思既非有，心亦定無。	思既非有，心亦定無。	If thought does not exist, then mind must also definitely be absent.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c10_15']	無心有情理必應有，有命等故異於命終。	無心有情理必應有，有命等故異於命終。	It must be that there is consciousness in a state of samādhi, because there is life, etc., and it is different from death.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c11_15']	有情色心非決定有，心若定有，色亦應然；	有情色心非決定有，心若定有，色亦應然；	The existence of sentient beings and form and mind is not certain. If mind definitely exists, then form must also be so.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c12_15']	色有時無，心亦應爾，故有命者即名有情。	色有時無，心亦應爾，故有命者即名有情。	Sometimes form exists and sometimes it does not. Mind must be the same way. Therefore the existence of life is the same as the existence of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c15_3']	然命必依色心隨一，引契經說識不離身，於定無心亦無違害，以即於此所依身中識必還生，故言不離。	然命必依色心隨一，引契經說識不離身，於定無心亦無違害，以即於此所依身中識必還生，故言不離。	However, life must be supported by either form or mind. The sutra is not contradicted when it says that consciousness does not leave the body, because consciousness will certainly be reborn in the body that is its support. Therefore it is said that consciousness does not leave the body.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c16_2']	謂一相續眾同分中識相續流，非畢竟斷。	謂一相續眾同分中識相續流，非畢竟斷。	This means that in a single life-stream and in a single class of sentient beings, the stream of consciousness is not absolutely severed.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c17_1']	譬如鬼病暫不發時，由未永除仍名不離。	譬如鬼病暫不發時，由未永除仍名不離。	It is like a person who is possessed by a ghost. When the ghost is not manifesting itself, it is not yet permanently gone and is still said to be present.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c18_8']	引壽煖識不相離言，於定無心亦無違害，唯於少分說此言故。	引壽煖識不相離言，於定無心亦無違害，唯於少分說此言故。	The statement that life, heat, and consciousness are inseparable is not contradicted when it is applied to the samādhi of cessation, because this statement is made only in part.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c19_17']	以無色中都無有煖，非無壽識，故此定中都無有識，非無壽煖。	以無色中都無有煖，非無壽識，故此定中都無有識，非無壽煖。	There is no heat in the formless realm, but this does not mean that there is no life or consciousness. Therefore consciousness is absent in this samādhi, but life and heat are not absent.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c20_12']	無色界中無一切色，後當廣辯。	無色界中無一切色，後當廣辯。	There is no form of any kind in the formless realm, as will be discussed later.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c21_3']	是故滅定必無有心。	是故滅定必無有心。	Therefore the samādhi of cessation is definitely devoid of mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c23_1']	然定後心復得生者，定前心作等無間緣所引攝故，又加行中要期勢力所引發故。	然定後心復得生者，定前心作等無間緣所引攝故，又加行中要期勢力所引發故。	However, the mind that arises after concentration is again able to arise because the mind prior to concentration has attracted it by acting as its similar and immediately antecedent condition, and also because it is attracted and emitted by the power of the prior practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c23_10']	滅盡定體為假為實？	滅盡定體為假為實？	Is the substance of the samādhi of cessation real or provisional?
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c24_8']	應言此定體實非假，能遮礙心令不生故。	應言此定體實非假，能遮礙心令不生故。	It should be said that this samādhi is real and not provisional, because it is able to obstruct mind and prevent it from arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c24_17']	經主於此引異釋言：	經主於此引異釋言：	The Śāstra master here cites an alternative interpretation:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c26_16']	由前定心能為遮礙，謂前定心與所餘心相違而起，由此起故，唯令餘心暫時不轉。	由前定心能為遮礙，謂前定心與所餘心相違而起，由此起故，唯令餘心暫時不轉。	The prior samādhi is able to obstruct, that is, the prior samādhi arises in opposition to the other minds. Because of its arising, it only causes the other minds to temporarily not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c28_4']	此能引發，違心所依，令相續故，唯不轉位假立為定，無別實體。	此能引發，違心所依，令相續故，唯不轉位假立為定，無別實體。	It is able to attract and emit the support that is opposed to mind, causing it to continue. Therefore, only in the state of non-arising is it provisionally established as samādhi, and it has no separate real substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0403c29_12']	此唯不轉分位假定，入前出後兩位皆無，故假說此是有為攝。	此唯不轉分位假定，入前出後兩位皆無，故假說此是有為攝。	This provisional samādhi of the state of non-arising only exists in the two states of entering and exiting, and does not exist in the middle. Therefore, it is provisionally said to be included in conditioned phenomena.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0404a01_12']	或即所依，由定心引，令如是起，假立為定。	或即所依，由定心引，令如是起，假立為定。	Or, the support is attracted by the concentrated mind and causes it to arise in this way. It is provisionally established as samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0404a02_1']	若爾，後心從何而起？	若爾，後心從何而起？	If this is so, from what do subsequent minds arise?
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0404a03_4']	彼說此依有根身起，以有根身與心展轉為種子故。	彼說此依有根身起，以有根身與心展轉為種子故。	They say that it arises in dependence on a body with organs, because the body with organs and mind are reciprocal seeds.

['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a02_14']	故知生等別有實物。	故知生等別有實物。	Therefore we know that birth, etc., are real entities apart from form, etc.

['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a04_13']	若離有為色等自性有生等物，一法一時應即生住衰異壞滅，許俱有故。	若離有為色等自性有生等物，一法一時應即生住衰異壞滅，許俱有故。	If there are entities such as birth apart from the intrinsic nature of conditioned form, etc., then one dharma at one time should be born, abide, decay, change, and be destroyed, because you admit that they exist simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a05_12']	執離有為無別生等，如斯過疾不可救療。	執離有為無別生等，如斯過疾不可救療。	If you hold that apart from conditioned dharmas there are no separate birth, etc., then this error is unavoidable.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a06_7']	一法一時功能差別，理不成故。	一法一時功能差別，理不成故。	Because it is unreasonable for one dharma at one time to have different functions.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a07_11']	許離有為有別生等，無斯過失，如體不同，用有別故。	許離有為有別生等，無斯過失，如體不同，用有別故。	If you admit that apart from conditioned dharmas there are separate birth, etc., then there is no such error, because just as their substance is not the same, their functions are also different.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a09_1']	現見內外諸羯剌藍、諸種子等，餘緣攝助，於生自果有勝功能。	現見內外諸羯剌藍、諸種子等，餘緣攝助，於生自果有勝功能。	We see that the internal and external kalala, seeds, etc., are assisted by other conditions and have a superior power to produce their own effects.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a10_3']	謂羯賴藍等，識所攝助為勝因性，生頞部曇等。	謂羯賴藍等，識所攝助為勝因性，生頞部曇等。	That is, kalala, etc., are assisted by consciousness and become the dominant cause for the production of arbuda, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a11_13']	雖頞部曇等非不待識，而非因識生頞部曇等，此二相續有差別故。	雖頞部曇等非不待識，而非因識生頞部曇等，此二相續有差別故。	Although arbuda, etc., are not independent of consciousness, consciousness is not the cause for the production of arbuda, etc., because there is a difference between the two continuities.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a13_2']	然非此識與頞部曇等不作勝緣，由此有彼有、此無彼無故。	然非此識與頞部曇等不作勝緣，由此有彼有、此無彼無故。	However, this consciousness is not a dominant condition for arbuda, etc., because when this exists, those exist, and when this does not exist, those do not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a15_2']	又非此識與羯賴藍等為俱助緣生頞部曇等，即令此識亦與種等為俱助緣生於芽等。	又非此識與羯賴藍等為俱助緣生頞部曇等，即令此識亦與種等為俱助緣生於芽等。	Also, this consciousness is not a co-arising and assisting condition for the production of arbuda, etc., and it is also not the case that this consciousness is a co-arising and assisting condition for the production of seeds, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a17_11']	如是種等，地等攝助為勝因性生於芽等，雖彼芽等非不待地等，而非因地等生於芽等，種等無間生芽等故。	如是種等，地等攝助為勝因性生於芽等，雖彼芽等非不待地等，而非因地等生於芽等，種等無間生芽等故。	In the same way, seeds, etc., are assisted by earth, etc., and become the dominant cause for the production of sprouts, etc. Although sprouts, etc., are not independent of earth, etc., earth, etc., are not the cause for the production of sprouts, etc., because sprouts, etc., arise immediately after seeds, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a18_14']	然非地等與彼芽等不作勝緣，芽等有無隨地等故。	然非地等與彼芽等不作勝緣，芽等有無隨地等故。	However, earth, etc., are not the predominant conditions for sprouts, etc., because the existence or nonexistence of sprouts, etc., is contingent upon the existence or nonexistence of earth, etc.

['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a23_4']	又自稱為釋迦弟子，必應亦許有俱生因，由契經言：	又自稱為釋迦弟子，必應亦許有俱生因，由契經言：	Also, those who call themselves disciples of Śākyamuni must also admit that there is a simultaneous cause, because a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a23_17']	識與名色更互為緣而得住故。	識與名色更互為緣而得住故。	Consciousness and name-and-form are conditions for each other and can exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a25_7']	然羯賴藍、種等，與頞部曇、芽等為前生因，識及地等為俱生緣。	然羯賴藍、種等，與頞部曇、芽等為前生因，識及地等為俱生緣。	However, kalala, seeds, etc., are the prior causes for arbuda, sprouts, etc., and consciousness and earth, etc., are the simultaneous conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409a28_4']	此俱生緣，比前生因其力增勝，以雖有彼羯賴藍等及與種等諸前生因，若無有識地等俱緣，即頞部曇芽等諸果必不生故。	此俱生緣，比前生因其力增勝，以雖有彼羯賴藍等及與種等諸前生因，若無有識地等俱緣，即頞部曇芽等諸果必不生故。	The power of this simultaneous condition is superior to the power of the prior condition of birth, because even though there are such prior conditions as kalala, etc., and seeds, etc., if there is no consciousness, etc., as simultaneous conditions, then such results as the kalala, etc., and sprouts, etc., will certainly not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b01_2']	由此准知，諸有為法雖有種種外助因緣，而必有內生住異滅為近助因，方得行世。	由此准知，諸有為法雖有種種外助因緣，而必有內生住異滅為近助因，方得行世。	On the basis of this, we know that even though there are various external conditions that assist dharmas, there must be internal birth, continuance, senescence, and desinence that are proximate conditions in order for dharmas to function in the world.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b02_12']	然有為法分位不同略有三種，謂引、果、用，未得、正得、已滅別故。	然有為法分位不同略有三種，謂引、果、用，未得、正得、已滅別故。	There are three kinds of conditioned dharmas, according to their different states, i.e., as yet to be acquired, being acquired, and having been destroyed, and therefore called attraction, result, and function.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b03_18']	此諸有為復有二種，謂有作用及唯有體，前是現在，後是去來。	此諸有為復有二種，謂有作用及唯有體，前是現在，後是去來。	These conditioned dharmas are of two kinds, i.e., those that have activity and those that only exist. The former are present, and the latter are past and future.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b04_16']	此復一一各有二種，謂彼功能有勝有劣。	此復一一各有二種，謂彼功能有勝有劣。	Each of these is of two kinds, i.e., their power is either superior or inferior.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b05_17']	謂有為法，若能為因，引攝自果，名為作用。	謂有為法，若能為因，引攝自果，名為作用。	That is, when a conditioned dharma is able to act as a cause and attract its own result, it is called activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b06_11']	若能為緣，攝助異類，是謂功能。	若能為緣，攝助異類，是謂功能。	If it can serve as a condition and assist in attracting other types, this is called its power.

['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b11_7']	謂或有法，於未獲得引果用時，由過未得正得已滅引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是名生相。	謂或有法，於未獲得引果用時，由過未得正得已滅引果用時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是名生相。	That is to say, there may be a dharma that, when it has not yet obtained the function of attracting its result, is assisted by external conditions in the past, present, and future, and gives rise to the power of being assisted by internal conditions in accomplishing its own function. This is called the characteristic of arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b13_10']	或復有法，於正獲得引果用時即由彼時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是餘三相。	或復有法，於正獲得引果用時即由彼時外緣攝助，於辦自事發起內緣攝助功能，是餘三相。	Or there may be a dharma that, when it is just obtaining the function of attracting its result, is assisted by external conditions at that time, and gives rise to the power of being assisted by internal conditions in accomplishing its own function. This is the other three characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b15_1']	於正生位，生為內緣，起所生法至已生位，此所生法名為已起。	於正生位，生為內緣，起所生法至已生位，此所生法名為已起。	In the present state of arising, arising serves as an internal condition, and the dharma that is being produced reaches the state of having arisen. This dharma that is being produced is called having arisen.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b17_6']	於正滅位住為內緣，安所住法，令引自果至已滅位，此所住法名於自果已能引發，即正滅位。	於正滅位住為內緣，安所住法，令引自果至已滅位，此所住法名於自果已能引發，即正滅位。	When it is in the process of cessation, it is the internal condition that supports the dharma that is being supported, causing it to attract its own effect until it reaches the state of cessation. The dharma that is being supported is said to be able to attract its own effect, which is in the process of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b18_10']	滅為內緣壞所滅法至已滅位，此所滅法名為已壞。	滅為內緣壞所滅法至已滅位，此所滅法名為已壞。	When it is in the process of cessation, it is the internal condition that destroys the dharma that is being destroyed until it reaches the state of cessation. The dharma that is being destroyed is said to be destroyed.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b19_1']	異相亦爾，如應當知。	異相亦爾，如應當知。	The same is true of the characteristic of difference. It should be understood according to the circumstances.

['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b22_6']	謂或有因，待處與果，如雨要待雲處方生，要贍部洲處金剛座方證無上正等菩提。	謂或有因，待處與果，如雨要待雲處方生，要贍部洲處金剛座方證無上正等菩提。	That is, there are causes that depend on place in order to give their effects, just as rain depends on the place of clouds in order to arise. One must attain the place of Jambudvīpa and the vajra seat in order to realize supreme perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b23_14']	或復有因待世與果，如異熟因順解脫分，要在過去方能與果。	或復有因待世與果，如異熟因順解脫分，要在過去方能與果。	Or there are causes that depend on time in order to give their effects, just as the cause of retribution and the cause of the aids to penetration must be in the past in order to be able to give their effects.

['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b26_10']	或復有因待位與果，如諸種子，至變果位方能生芽。	或復有因待位與果，如諸種子，至變果位方能生芽。	Or, there is a cause that gives its result in dependence on state, as in the case of seeds, which can only produce sprouts when they are in the state of changing into sprouts.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b27_18']	初無漏心及光明等雖體先有，而要未來正生位中能有所作。	初無漏心及光明等雖體先有，而要未來正生位中能有所作。	Although the first pure mind and light, etc., exist prior to their arising, they can only function in the state of future arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409b29_7']	或復有因待伴與果，如諸大種心心所等，要與伴俱能有所作。	或復有因待伴與果，如諸大種心心所等，要與伴俱能有所作。	Or, there is a cause that gives its result in dependence on companions, as in the case of the great elements, mind, mental factors, etc., which can only function when accompanied by companions.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409c01_6']	由斯差別，緣起正理四相起用分位不同。	由斯差別，緣起正理四相起用分位不同。	Because of these differences, the correct principle of dependent arising is that the four characteristics arise and function in different states.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409c02_14']	謂正生時，生相起用至已生位，住異滅三同於一時各起別用。	謂正生時，生相起用至已生位，住異滅三同於一時各起別用。	That is, when it is in the state of arising, the characteristic of arising functions. When it reaches the state of having arisen, the three characteristics of abiding, changing, and ceasing each function separately.
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409c04_4']	如是四相，用時既別，如何難言一法一時應即生住衰異壞滅？	如是四相，用時既別，如何難言一法一時應即生住衰異壞滅？	Since the four characteristics function at different times, why is it difficult to say that a single dharma at one time should be born, abide, decay, change, and be destroyed?
['ZH_T29_1562_013:0409c05_13', 'ZH_T29_1562_013:0409c06_11']	又正滅時，此所相法由餘住相為勝因故，暫時安住，能引自果；🔽即於爾時由餘異相為勝因故，令其衰異；	又正滅時，此所相法由餘住相為勝因故，暫時安住，能引自果； 即於爾時由餘異相為勝因故，令其衰異；	Moreover, when it is about to cease, this dharma that is characterized is temporarily stabilized by the other characteristic of abiding, which is its predominant cause, and is able to attract its own effect;🔽at that very moment, it is caused to decay by the other characteristic of change, which is its predominant cause;
