Therefore, various treatises say that by transforming the five consciousnesses one attains the knowledge of accomplishing activities, and often manifests the eight aspects to display various activities, thus it is called having the same activity.

The Dharma body is the same as the three without difference. The enjoyment and transformation bodies are only intention and activity.

Because their intentions are many, they manifest transformation bodies with various forms, either in the eight aspects or according to the various types, manifesting forms.
