Because cause and effect are great, and because it is fully equipped with the function of transporting. The effect refers to the ten grounds.

In this way, one does not attain their intrinsic nature, and because language does not transform, it is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1598_001:0380b17_2']	又非無字轉有少名能詮，故諸契經名為自性亦不應理。	又非無字轉有少名能詮，故諸契經名為自性亦不應理。	Moreover, it is unreasonable to say that without the transformation of words there are a few names that can express, and therefore the sūtras say that names are the intrinsic nature.

It shows that they have attained the merits of dhāraṇīs and eloquence, and are able to uphold and expound the meaning of the Great Vehicle, and therefore this meaning is explained in this way.

The difference is like this.

['ZH_T31_1598_001:0382b18_9']	謂諸菩薩要先於因得善巧已，方於緣起應得善巧，知從此因而有彼果、復知彼果要從此因，是故非離此因言教能了知彼因者即是阿賴耶識。	謂諸菩薩要先於因得善巧已，方於緣起應得善巧，知從此因而有彼果、復知彼果要從此因，是故非離此因言教能了知彼因者即是阿賴耶識。	It means that bodhisattvas must first attain skill in the causes, and only then should they attain skill in dependent origination, knowing that from this cause there is that effect, and further knowing that that effect must arise from this cause. Therefore, apart from this causal teaching, one cannot understand that cause. That which is to be understood is precisely the ālaya consciousness.

Because one denies the existence of what has a cause, it is called denial. Thus, superimposition and denial are both called extremes. This means falling into error, because when these two occur, one loses the middle way.
['ZH_T31_1598_001:0382b25_16']	由善數習真實觀故，於此二邊遠離善巧，於遍計所執唯有增益而無損減，都無有故，以要於有方起損減。	由善數習真實觀故，於此二邊遠離善巧，於遍計所執唯有增益而無損減，都無有故，以要於有方起損減。	Because of repeatedly cultivating true contemplation, one skillfully avoids these two extremes. With regard to the imagined, there is only superimposition and no denial, because it does not exist at all. One can only deny what exists.

['ZH_T31_1598_001:0382c01_18']	即由此故，或復於此，善能遠離增益損減二邊過者，謂於依他起性，增益實無遍計所執性、損減實有圓成實性。	即由此故，或復於此，善能遠離增益損減二邊過者，謂於依他起性，增益實無遍計所執性、損減實有圓成實性。	For this reason, or else, one who is able to skillfully avoid the two extreme errors of superimposition and denial with regard to this dependent nature is one who superimposes the really non-existent imagined nature on the dependent nature and denies the really existent perfected nature.
