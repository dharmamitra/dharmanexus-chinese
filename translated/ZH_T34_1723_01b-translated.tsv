The main teaching of the One Vehicle bestows predictions to the three capacities. The fundamental purpose has already brought benefits, transforming those of the two vehicles out of the turbid waters.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661b13_2']	此經下云：	此經下云：	01b	The sutra below says:

Although in the past it disparaged the śrāvakas who delight in the lesser teachings in front of the bodhisattvas, the Buddha truly teaches and transforms with the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661b17_4']	」又〈提婆達多品〉「智積菩薩白多寶佛可還本土」，故知事了方始請還，明知說一乘處，正是經宗。	」又〈提婆達多品〉「智積菩薩白多寶佛可還本土」，故知事了方始請還，明知說一乘處，正是經宗。	01b	Also, in the chapter on Devadatta, Bodhisattva Zhiji says to the Buddha of Abundant Treasures that he may return to his original land. Therefore, it is known that after the matter is finished, he then requests the return. It is clear that the place where the One Vehicle is taught is precisely the main point of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661b20_9']	若不說一乘但獲益處皆正宗者，〈普賢品〉中無量菩薩得陀羅尼，三千世界微塵數菩薩行普賢道，亦是不說一乘而獲益故，皆應正宗。	若不說一乘但獲益處皆正宗者，〈普賢品〉中無量菩薩得陀羅尼，三千世界微塵數菩薩行普賢道，亦是不說一乘而獲益故，皆應正宗。	01b	If it is said that only the section where benefits are obtained is the main part without speaking of the One Vehicle, then in the chapter on Samantabhadra, countless bodhisattvas attained dhāraṇīs, and bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in the trichiliocosm practiced the path of Samantabhadra. Since they also obtained benefits without speaking of the One Vehicle, it should all be the main part.

The chapter on the practice of peace and bliss and the chapter on the emergence from the earth, these two chapters, clarify the practice of the One Vehicle. From the chapter on the lifespan of the Tathāgata to the chapter on the always-disparaged, a total of five chapters, explain the fruition of the One Vehicle.

It is advised to abandon the provisional and take up the real. The śrāvakas, upon realizing this, finally receive the prediction.

It is advised to study the right and eliminate the wrong. The learners, by means of this, emerge from the earth. Explaining the fruition causes one to know the true and transformed bodies and the fruition of the realization. It is advised to recognize the transformed and seek the realization of the true. Gradually attaining the superior virtues of the two states of causes and fruition. The bodhisattvas, upon knowing this, finally realize the path. Fully revealing the superior virtues accomplished by the fruition and causes.

Accomplishment means the meaning of being complete and perfect. It wants to clarify that the introduction is complete with seven meanings, and the seven meanings are perfect, which is not found in other sūtras.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661c13_3']	一序分成就，始述通由具圓滿故，山城圓滿表勝餘故偏得序名，實七皆序。	一序分成就，始述通由具圓滿故，山城圓滿表勝餘故偏得序名，實七皆序。	01b	First, the accomplishment of the introductory section. Beginning with the general cause, it is complete and perfect. The mountain city is perfect, representing superiority over others, thus it alone gets the name of introduction, but in reality, all seven are introductions.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661c15_1']	二眾成就，「與大比丘眾」下是，一數、二行、三攝功德、四威儀如法住圓滿，勝餘經故。	二眾成就，「與大比丘眾」下是，一數、二行、三攝功德、四威儀如法住圓滿，勝餘經故。	01b	Second, the accomplishment of the assembly, which is below together with a great bhikṣu assembly. It is the perfection of number, practice, gathering merit, and dignified deportment. It is superior to other sūtras.

First, speaking the Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning with seventeen names, it is superior to other sūtras.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661c18_9']	四所依說法隨順威儀住成就，「佛說此經已結跏趺坐」下是。	四所依說法隨順威儀住成就，「佛說此經已結跏趺坐」下是。	01b	Fourth is the accomplishment of the proper deportment of the speaker in accordance with the Dharma, which is shown by the passage after the Buddha finished speaking this sutra, he sat cross-legged.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661c19_8']	依止定、器、眾生世間，此三種法餘經無故。	依止定、器、眾生世間，此三種法餘經無故。	01b	This is because the three kinds of dharmas of relying on concentration, the vessel, and the world of sentient beings are not found in other sutras.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661c21_9']	五依止說因成就，「爾時佛放眉間光」下是，見能照、照境、所照等事生希有心，餘經無故。	五依止說因成就，「爾時佛放眉間光」下是，見能照、照境、所照等事生希有心，餘經無故。	01b	Fifth is the accomplishment of the cause of the teaching, which is shown by the passage at that time the Buddha emitted light from between his eyebrows. This is because the arising of the mind of wonder at seeing the illuminator, the illuminated realm, and the illuminated things, etc., is not found in other sutras.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661c23_13']	六大眾生現前欲聞法成就，「爾時彌勒菩薩作是念」下是，雖問一人多人欲聞生希有心，餘經無故。	六大眾生現前欲聞法成就，「爾時彌勒菩薩作是念」下是，雖問一人多人欲聞生希有心，餘經無故。	01b	Sixth is the accomplishment of the great assembly's present desire to hear the Dharma, which is shown by the passage at that time Maitreya Bodhisattva had this thought. This is because the arising of the mind of wonder at the desire to hear of one person or many people asking is not found in other sutras.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0661c25_17']	七文殊師利答成就，以宿命智現見過去因果相，成就十種事如現在前，是故能答，餘經無故。	七文殊師利答成就，以宿命智現見過去因果相，成就十種事如現在前，是故能答，餘經無故。	01b	Seventh is the accomplishment of Manjushri's answer, which is because he uses the knowledge of past lives to directly see the characteristics of past causes and effects, accomplishing ten kinds of things as if they were present, and therefore is able to answer, which is not found in other sutras.

When the Buddha was about to enter nirvāṇa, the Buddha ordered that if there were doubts, they should be asked. At that time, Upāli and Ānanda taught Ānanda to ask about four matters:
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0662a10_3']	一佛滅度後諸比丘等以誰為師，二依何處住，三惡性比丘如何治罰，四一切經首當置何言。	一佛滅度後諸比丘等以誰為師，二依何處住，三惡性比丘如何治罰，四一切經首當置何言。	01b	First, after the Buddha's nirvana, which one should the bhikṣus take as their teacher? Second, on what should they rely to abide? Third, how should they punish evil-natured bhikṣus? Fourth, what words should be placed at the beginning of all sūtras?

According to the Benevolent Kings and other sutras, it is the initial cause for progressing to the holy stages. Therefore, the forty minds take faith as the foremost.

The mind of great enlightenment takes wholesome roots as its essence, takes good friends as its conditions, and takes non-retrogression as its impetus.

The faults of destruction and blame are established by the name of contamination. This only refers to active manifestation, because there are no more afflictions that are seeds;

['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c06_6']	一欲漏、二有漏、三無明漏。	一欲漏、二有漏、三無明漏。	01b	First, the leakage of desire; second, the leakage of existence; third, the leakage of ignorance.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c08_8']	三出體，欲界見道四十煩惱，四諦一一皆具十故，并修道六，謂貪、瞋、慢、無明、身見、邊見。	三出體，欲界見道四十煩惱，四諦一一皆具十故，并修道六，謂貪、瞋、慢、無明、身見、邊見。	01b	Second, the classification of their essence: the forty afflictions of the path of seeing in the desire realm, because each of the four truths is fully endowed with ten, and the six of the path of cultivation, namely greed, hatred, pride, ignorance, belief in the self, and extreme views.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c09_17']	此中除五無明，餘四十一根本煩惱并忿、恨等二十隨惑並名欲漏；	此中除五無明，餘四十一根本煩惱并忿、恨等二十隨惑並名欲漏；	01b	Here, excluding the five ignorances, the remaining forty-one fundamental afflictions and the twenty secondary afflictions such as anger and resentment are all called the leakage of desire;

Within them, each excludes five ignorances, totaling seventy-two fundamental afflictions. Together with the deceit and pretense of the form realm, and the arrogance of the two realms, these four minor secondary afflictions and the sixteen major secondary afflictions are called the leakage of existence.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c13_16']	三界合有十五無明，名無明漏。	三界合有十五無明，名無明漏。	01b	The fifteen ignorances of the three realms together are called the leakage of ignorance.

The desire realm is only the stage of the scattered mind, only the stage of the contaminated mind, it is common to the five destinies, it has the four stages, and it is the stage of the two natures of unwholesome and obscured-neutral afflictions. For these reasons, it is established separately as the one desire realm. The upper realms are both the stage of concentration and the stage of the uncontaminated mind, they are common to one destiny, one stage, and one nature of affliction. For these reasons, they are combined and established as the one existence realm.

It is the support of the first two, because it possesses the eleven special matters. For these reasons, it is established separately from the other afflictions.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c21_2']	五得名所從，雖知三界一切煩惱應皆名有漏，漏於三有有之漏故。	五得名所從，雖知三界一切煩惱應皆名有漏，漏於三有有之漏故。	01b	The fifth is the source from which the names are obtained. Although it is known that all the afflictions of the three realms should all be called the contaminated, because the contaminated are the contamination of the three existences,
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c22_2']	下界煩惱多緣欲起，從勝為名，說為欲漏；	下界煩惱多緣欲起，從勝為名，說為欲漏；	01b	the afflictions of the lower realms often arise in dependence on desire. From the superior, they are named and are said to be the desire realm.

['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c24_3']	無明不以餘法為名，彰自行相名無明漏。	無明不以餘法為名，彰自行相名無明漏。	01b	Ignorance is not named after other dharmas. It manifests its own characteristics and is called the ignorance realm.
['ZH_T34_1723_01b:0667c24_12']	此漏非一故名為諸。	此漏非一故名為諸。	01b	Since these outflows are not just one, they are called various.

'Exhaustion' means the various outflows have already been exhausted. 'Absence' means there are no more afflictions. Because both manifest and latent afflictions are absent, one attains true mastery.
