['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c19_10']	次答果數壽量幾時者，然世間之尊所有真言勢力，極上不過一劫。	次答果數壽量幾時者，然世間之尊所有真言勢力，極上不過一劫。	Next, the answer to the question of the number of fruits and how long the lifespan is: The power of the mantras of worldly honored ones does not exceed one kalpa at most.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c21_1']	佛所說者則逾一劫數，謂逾一劫復逾一劫，如此無量乃至成佛也。	佛所說者則逾一劫數，謂逾一劫復逾一劫，如此無量乃至成佛也。	What is spoken by the Buddha then exceeds one kalpa, meaning it exceeds one kalpa and exceeds another kalpa, in this way, to the immeasurable, until becoming a Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c22_4']	是故世人所護悉地壽量及果，則有數限不逾一劫。	是故世人所護悉地壽量及果，則有數限不逾一劫。	Therefore, the lifespan and fruits of the siddhi guarded by worldly people have a limited number and do not exceed one kalpa.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c23_3']	今則不失，壽量無盡，過於一劫數之量也。	今則不失，壽量無盡，過於一劫數之量也。	Now, it is not lost, the lifespan is endless, exceeding the measure of the number of kalpas.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c24_16']	若事中釋者，但隨力能過若干劫，或過無量劫壽量不盡，亦是過彼世天也。	若事中釋者，但隨力能過若干劫，或過無量劫壽量不盡，亦是過彼世天也。	If explained in terms of events, it simply follows one's ability, exceeding several kalpas, or the lifespan exceeding immeasurable kalpas is also exceeding those worldly gods.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c25_12']	故云超劫者，是通含不定之語也。	故云超劫者，是通含不定之語也。	Therefore, it is said that those who transcend kalpas are the words that generally include the indefinite.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c26_11']	剋實而談壽量，出過劫數受報亦無限量也。	剋實而談壽量，出過劫數受報亦無限量也。	Speaking in terms of the actual, the lifespan exceeds the number of kalpas, and the reward received is also of unlimited measure.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c27_3']	次答三昧者，略有多種。	次答三昧者，略有多種。	Next, the answer to samādhi is, in brief, of many kinds.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c28_8']	若諸佛及佛子、諸佛之大仙、佛子眾三昧，清淨離諸想。	若諸佛及佛子、諸佛之大仙、佛子眾三昧，清淨離諸想。	If it is the samādhi of all buddhas and their disciples, the great sages of the buddhas, and the assembly of the Buddha's disciples, it is pure and free from all conceptual thoughts.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c28_20']	有想為世間，二乘名離想。	有想為世間，二乘名離想。	Having conceptual thoughts is the world, and the two vehicles are called free from conceptual thoughts.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0740c29_14']	三昧若是世間瑜伽，名有相三昧。	三昧若是世間瑜伽，名有相三昧。	If samādhi is a worldly yoga, it is called a samādhi with characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a03_1']	此中三摩是等義，地是慧義，以慧觀照如前三事皆空，以三事體空平等合而為一，是名三昧地也。	此中三摩是等義，地是慧義，以慧觀照如前三事皆空，以三事體空平等合而為一，是名三昧地也。	Here, samā means equality, and bhūmi means wisdom. Using wisdom to illuminate the three things as all empty as before, equating the empty essence of the three things and making them one, this is called the stage of samādhi.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a05_12']	然佛與菩薩三昧皆離想清淨，以此三昧正觀三事皆等，更無分別，離諸想故，本性純白離諸染污，故名清淨也。	然佛與菩薩三昧皆離想清淨，以此三昧正觀三事皆等，更無分別，離諸想故，本性純白離諸染污，故名清淨也。	However, the samādhis of the Buddha and bodhisattvas are all free from conceptual thoughts and pure. Using this samādhi to correctly contemplate the three things as all equal, without further discrimination, because free from conceptual thoughts, the inherent nature is purely white and free from all defilements, thus it is called pure.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a08_1']	若有想者，謂世間一切三昧，謂隨其果修行，望果修因有所希望，極至四禪八定處不得過，故非清淨也。	若有想者，謂世間一切三昧，謂隨其果修行，望果修因有所希望，極至四禪八定處不得過，故非清淨也。	If there is conceptualization, it refers to all worldly samādhis, which means practicing according to their fruits, hoping for fruits while cultivating causes, and hoping for something, ultimately reaching the four dhyānas and eight concentrations, but not going beyond them, so they are not pure.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a09_18']	聲聞緣覺雖得清淨，然未能一切清淨，以於煩惱、所知二障尚未遍知，故未純淨也。	聲聞緣覺雖得清淨，然未能一切清淨，以於煩惱、所知二障尚未遍知，故未純淨也。	Although śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas attain purity, they are still not completely pure, because they have not yet thoroughly understood the two hindrances of afflictions and the knowable, so they are not yet completely pure.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a10_6']	世三昧又有二種：	世三昧又有二種：	There are two kinds of worldly samādhis:
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a11_12']	一者斷見、二者常見，若斷見而無分別，常者有少分別也。	一者斷見、二者常見，若斷見而無分別，常者有少分別也。	The first is the view of annihilation, and the second is the view of permanence. If one has the view of annihilation, there is no discrimination, but if one is permanent, there is a little discrimination.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a12_4']	從業得果者，有成熟熟時。	從業得果者，有成熟熟時。	As for obtaining fruits from karma, there is a time of maturation and ripening.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a13_9']	若得悉地者，於業自在得迴轉，須受亦得、不受亦得也。	若得悉地者，於業自在得迴轉，須受亦得、不受亦得也。	If one attains spiritual powers, one has mastery over karma and can transform it, and whether one accepts it or not, one can attain it.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a14_1']	心無自性故，心性離因果。	心無自性故，心性離因果。	Because the mind has no self-nature, the nature of the mind is free from cause and effect.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a14_8']	云不者，無也。	云不者，無也。	Not means non-existence.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a15_8']	於解脫相、業生生等諸虛空，成就及熟時業得果。	於解脫相、業生生等諸虛空，成就及熟時業得果。	In the characteristics of liberation, the arising of karma, and so forth, in all the emptiness, when the karma is accomplished and matured, the fruits of karma are obtained.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a16_13']	若悉地得，當業迴心之無性故，果因亦離，業生解脫。	若悉地得，當業迴心之無性故，果因亦離，業生解脫。	If the accomplishment is attained, the karma should be turned towards the mind's lack of intrinsic nature, and therefore the cause and effect are also separated, and the arising of karma is liberated.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a17_19']	生如虛空者，謂世間有相三昧猶有業，望報而修，故名成就。	生如虛空者，謂世間有相三昧猶有業，望報而修，故名成就。	As for arising like emptiness, it means that the worldly samādhi with characteristics still has karma, and is cultivated in expectation of retribution, so it is called accomplishment.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a18_9']	得是成熟，名悉地也。	得是成熟，名悉地也。	Attaining this maturity is called accomplishment.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a20_6']	若以此世間空而迴向此心之無自性，體既無相，等於虛空無際，故得功德亦廣也。	若以此世間空而迴向此心之無自性，體既無相，等於虛空無際，故得功德亦廣也。	If this worldly emptiness is dedicated towards this mind's lack of intrinsic nature, since the essence is already without characteristics, it is equal to the boundless emptiness, and therefore the merits obtained are also vast.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a21_1']	迴此心之無自性者，心名質多。	迴此心之無自性者，心名質多。	As for turning this mind's lack of intrinsic nature, the mind is called citta.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a21_19']	質多者，猶如眾綵莊嚴積聚，名為質多。	質多者，猶如眾綵莊嚴積聚，名為質多。	Citta is like a pile of various adornments, which is called citta.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a22_18']	猶眾綵所成故，即是無有自性，此即是因也。	猶眾綵所成故，即是無有自性，此即是因也。	Since it is composed of various adornments, it is without intrinsic nature, and this is the cause.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a23_16']	本因既無自性，當知所生之果亦無自性。	本因既無自性，當知所生之果亦無自性。	Since the original cause is without intrinsic nature, one should know that the effect that is produced is also without intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a24_2']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a24_13']	若因有生者，果可有生。	若因有生者，果可有生。	If the cause has arising, then the effect can have arising.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a25_15']	今既因尚待緣而成，無生無性，當知生不可得也。	今既因尚待緣而成，無生無性，當知生不可得也。	Now, since the cause still depends on conditions to be formed, it has no arising and no nature. One should know that arising cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a26_10']	以因果皆如是，故得解脫諸業也。	以因果皆如是，故得解脫諸業也。	Because cause and effect are both like this, one can be liberated from all karmic actions.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a26_15']	或有說言：	或有說言：	Some say:
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a27_12']	若如此者，便是無因無果，墮斷滅見者。	若如此者，便是無因無果，墮斷滅見者。	If it is like this, then there is no cause and no effect, falling into the view of annihilation.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a27_17']	此亦不然。	此亦不然。	This is also not so.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741a29_1']	但離業生之性，既離業生即有法性之生，等於虛空。	但離業生之性，既離業生即有法性之生，等於虛空。	It only departs from the nature of karmic birth. Since it departs from karmic birth, there is the birth of the nature of dharmas, equal to empty space.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741b01_9']	虛空無邊故，當知所成功德利眾生事亦無邊無盡，故非斷也。	虛空無邊故，當知所成功德利眾生事亦無邊無盡，故非斷也。	Because empty space is boundless, one should know that the merits and virtues that benefit sentient beings are also boundless and inexhaustible, thus not annihilated.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741b02_9']	右以略說偈答金剛手問了，更以長行說之。	右以略說偈答金剛手問了，更以長行說之。	To the right, having briefly answered Vajrapāṇi's question with verses, he further explains it in prose.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741b03_16']	云復次者，由前已說之事有所不盡，更續明之，故云復次也。	云復次者，由前已說之事有所不盡，更續明之，故云復次也。	As for next, it is because there are things that have not been fully explained before, and he continues to clarify them, thus saying next.
['ZH_T39_1796_016:0741b04_17']	諦聽者，以此法轉深，祕旨要故，重戒令諦聽也。	諦聽者，以此法轉深，祕旨要故，重戒令諦聽也。	Listen attentively means that since this Dharma is profound and secret, it is repeatedly admonished to listen attentively.
