The great earth is a metaphor for the Buddha-jewel, the various mountains and medicinal herbs are metaphors for the Dharma-jewel, and being used for sentient beings is a metaphor for the Sangha-jewel.

All sentient beings will attain the fruition of Buddhahood. This principle belongs to the person, which is also internal, but it is not yet present, which is also external. Because it is external, it is not internal; because it is internal, it is not external. It is called the secret treasury.

['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069a21_1']	如形殘人、如外道論等種種譬喻，下文廣說，是名昔教祕密之藏。	如形殘人、如外道論等種種譬喻，下文廣說，是名昔教祕密之藏。	It is likened to a person with a disfigured body, the treatises of non-Buddhists, and various other analogies, which are extensively explained in the following text. This is called the secret treasury of the teachings of the past.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069a23_4']	今經開敞，如月處空清淨顯露，不如昔教，但以正法微妙不可思議、絕名離相眾生不解名為祕密；	今經開敞，如月處空清淨顯露，不如昔教，但以正法微妙不可思議、絕名離相眾生不解名為祕密；	The present sutra opens and reveals it, like the moon in the sky, pure and evident, unlike the teachings of the past. It is simply because the true Dharma is subtle, inconceivable, beyond words and characteristics, and sentient beings do not understand it that it is called secret;
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069a24_3']	法界包含攝一切法，用不可盡名之為藏。	法界包含攝一切法，用不可盡名之為藏。	The Dharma realm encompasses and includes all dharmas, and its inexhaustible function is called a treasury.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069a25_15']	故下文云「不縱不橫、不並不別是祕密義，三法具足無有缺減是其藏義。	故下文云「不縱不橫、不並不別是祕密義，三法具足無有缺減是其藏義。	Therefore, the text below says, Not vertical, not horizontal, not the same, not different is the secret meaning. The three dharmas are complete, without deficiency, which is the meaning of the treasury.

['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069a29_1']	一譬三點、二譬三目、三合以三德。	一譬三點、二譬三目、三合以三德。	First, comparing it to the three dots; second, comparing it to the three eyes; third, combining it with the three virtues.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b01_7']	此之三文，一往而言是從事入理，三點是文字，此約言教；	此之三文，一往而言是從事入理，三點是文字，此約言教；	These three texts, speaking generally, are from the practical to the principle. The three dots are written characters, which are about verbal teachings;
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b01_18']	三目是天眼，此約修行；	三目是天眼，此約修行；	The three eyes are the heavenly eye, which is about practice;
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b02_8']	三德是佛師，此即約理。	三德是佛師，此即約理。	The three virtues are the Buddha's teacher, which is about principle.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b04_21']	又是佛印印於教行，凡有言說與此相應即祕密教，修習相應是祕密行，證得相應是祕密理，故約三釋稱理、教、行。	又是佛印印於教行，凡有言說與此相應即祕密教，修習相應是祕密行，證得相應是祕密理，故約三釋稱理、教、行。	Moreover, this Buddha seal seals the teachings and practices. Any words that accord with this are the secret teachings. Cultivating in accordance is the secret practice. Realizing in accordance is the secret principle. Therefore, in terms of the three explanations, it is called principle, teaching, and practice.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b07_9']	初三點中言云何如世伊字，外國有舊新兩伊，舊伊橫豎斷絕相離，借此況彼橫如列火、豎如點水，各不相續；	初三點中言云何如世伊字，外國有舊新兩伊，舊伊橫豎斷絕相離，借此況彼橫如列火、豎如點水，各不相續；	In the first three dots, it says how is it like the letter 'i' in the world? In a foreign country, there are two kinds of 'i' characters, old and new. The old 'i' is horizontally and vertically cut off and separated. Borrowing this to illustrate the other, the horizontal is like a row of fire, and the vertical is like a dot of water, each not continuing with each other;
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b09_1']	不橫不同列火、不豎不同點水，應如此土草下字相細畫相連，是新伊相。	不橫不同列火、不豎不同點水，應如此土草下字相細畫相連，是新伊相。	Not horizontal, not the same as a row of fire, not vertical, not the same as a dot of water, it should be like the character 'i' in this land, with the fine lines connected, which is the new 'i' character.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b11_2']	舊伊可譬昔教三德，法身本有，般若修成，入無餘已方是解脫無復身智，如豎點水縱而相離。	舊伊可譬昔教三德，法身本有，般若修成，入無餘已方是解脫無復身智，如豎點水縱而相離。	The old 'i' character can be compared to the three virtues of the past teachings. The Dharma body originally exists, prajñā is cultivated and accomplished, and after entering nirvāṇa without remainder, it is liberation. There is no body or wisdom, like a vertical dot of water, extended but separated.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b12_12']	又約身約智分得有餘解脫，橫一時有、三法各異，如橫列火各不相關。	又約身約智分得有餘解脫，橫一時有、三法各異，如橫列火各不相關。	Furthermore, in terms of the body and wisdom, one attains the remaining liberation, existing horizontally and simultaneously, with the three dharmas each different, like horizontal rows of fires unrelated to each other.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b14_15']	新伊字者，譬今教三德，法身即照亦即自在，名一為三，三無別體故是不橫，非前非後故是非縱。	新伊字者，譬今教三德，法身即照亦即自在，名一為三，三無別體故是不橫，非前非後故是非縱。	The new character yi illustrates the three virtues of the present teaching: the Dharma body is illumination and also self-mastery. It is called one as three, and the three have no separate essence, so it is not horizontal. It is neither before nor after, so it is not longitudinal.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b16_18']	一即三如大點，三即一如細畫，而三而一、而一而三，不可一三說、不可一三思，故名不可思議。	一即三如大點，三即一如細畫，而三而一、而一而三，不可一三說、不可一三思，故名不可思議。	One as three is like the large dot, and three as one is like the fine stroke. Three and one, one and three, cannot be spoken of as one or three, and cannot be thought of as one or three, so it is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b17_19']	不可思議者，即非三非一名祕密藏，如世伊字。	不可思議者，即非三非一名祕密藏，如世伊字。	The inconceivable is neither three nor one, and is called the secret treasury, like the character yi in the world.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b19_8']	此句是茲經之根本，為顯斯義廣立問答，致二十五品洋洋無盡。	此句是茲經之根本，為顯斯義廣立問答，致二十五品洋洋無盡。	This phrase is the root of this sutra. In order to reveal this meaning, many questions and answers are established, resulting in twenty-five chapters that are vast and inexhaustible.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b20_5']	若失此意全迷根本，將何指歸云云。	若失此意全迷根本，將何指歸云云。	If one misses this meaning, one will completely misunderstand the root. What can one point to as the destination? And so on.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b23_17']	次約三目釋者，摩醯首羅居色界頂，統領大千，一面三目、三目一面，不可單言一三縱橫若並若別，能嚴天顏作世界主徹照三千，若不縱橫，嚴主照世一切皆成。	次約三目釋者，摩醯首羅居色界頂，統領大千，一面三目、三目一面，不可單言一三縱橫若並若別，能嚴天顏作世界主徹照三千，若不縱橫，嚴主照世一切皆成。	Next, using the three eyes to explain, Mahesvara resides at the peak of the form realm, governing the great trichiliocosm. He has three eyes on one face, and one face with three eyes, which cannot be simply said to be one or three, either vertically or horizontally, together or separately. He can adorn the heavenly countenance, become the lord of the world, and illuminate the trichiliocosm. If not vertically or horizontally, then adorning, being the lord, and illuminating the world all become.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b25_4']	三德亦爾，縱橫並別祕藏不成，不縱不橫祕密藏則成云云。	三德亦爾，縱橫並別祕藏不成，不縱不橫祕密藏則成云云。	The three virtues are also like this. If vertically or horizontally, together or separately, the secret treasury is not formed. If not vertically or horizontally, the secret treasury is formed. Thus and so forth.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b26_10']	次約三德釋祕密藏者，果地眾德但言三者，蓋舉略兼諸。	次約三德釋祕密藏者，果地眾德但言三者，蓋舉略兼諸。	Next, using the three virtues to explain the secret treasury. The myriad virtues of the fruition ground are only said to be three, which generally includes all.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069b29_1']	法身之身非色非無色，非色故不可形相見、非無色故不可心想知，雖非色而色充滿十方，巨細相容不廣不狹；	法身之身非色非無色，非色故不可形相見、非無色故不可心想知，雖非色而色充滿十方，巨細相容不廣不狹；	The body of the Dharma body is neither form nor formless. Because it is not form, it cannot be seen by form or appearance. Because it is not formless, it cannot be known by thought or mind. Although it is not form, form fills the ten directions. The large and small mutually contain each other, neither broad nor narrow;
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c01_12']	雖非非色亦可尋求，能發眾生深廣智慧，故曰如來色無盡等即法身德。	雖非非色亦可尋求，能發眾生深廣智慧，故曰如來色無盡等即法身德。	Although it is not non-form, it can still be sought. It can give rise to the profound and vast wisdom of sentient beings, thus it is called the inexhaustible form of the Tathagata, which is the virtue of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c04_10']	般若者，非知非字，非知故不可動慮分別、非字故不可言說書紳，亦非不知非不字，非不知故不同灰滅、非不字故不同偏空。	般若者，非知非字，非知故不可動慮分別、非字故不可言說書紳，亦非不知非不字，非不知故不同灰滅、非不字故不同偏空。	Prajna is neither knowledge nor words. Because it is not knowledge, it cannot be moved by thought or discrimination. Because it is not words, it cannot be spoken or written. It is also not non-knowledge or non-words. Because it is not non-knowledge, it is not the same as being extinguished like ashes. Because it is not non-words, it is not the same as biased emptiness.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c05_12']	雖非知，無所不照三諦遍朗，極佛境界凡聖並明；	雖非知，無所不照三諦遍朗，極佛境界凡聖並明；	Although it is not knowledge, there is nothing it does not illuminate. The three truths are universally bright, reaching the ultimate realm of the Buddha, with both ordinary beings and sages clearly illuminated.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c07_12']	雖非字，而半滿具足，世間出世間出世間上上諸字悉了，法界流注若懸河海涌不可窮盡。	雖非字，而半滿具足，世間出世間出世間上上諸字悉了，法界流注若懸河海涌不可窮盡。	Although it is not words, it is replete with the half and full [teachings]. All the words of the world, the world beyond the world, and the world beyond the world beyond are completely understood. The flowing and surging of the Dharma realm is like a cascading river or an overflowing ocean, inexhaustible.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c09_10']	《淨名》云「能以一音演說法，眾生隨類各得解，皆謂世尊同其語，斯則神力不共法。	《淨名》云「能以一音演說法，眾生隨類各得解，皆謂世尊同其語，斯則神力不共法。	The Vimalakirti Sutra says: With a single voice, he expounds the Dharma, and sentient beings each understand according to their kind. They all think that the World-Honored One speaks their own language. This is the unique spiritual power.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c09_16']	」即般若德。	」即般若德。	This is the virtue of prajna.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c11_6']	解脫者，非喧非寂、非縛非脫，非縛故五住不能繫、非脫故十智不能虛。	解脫者，非喧非寂、非縛非脫，非縛故五住不能繫、非脫故十智不能虛。	Liberation is neither noisy nor tranquil, neither bound nor liberated. Because it is not bound, the five abodes cannot bind it. Because it is not liberated, the ten wisdoms cannot make it empty.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c12_6']	非脫而脫，二邊之所不拘，如百句解脫中說；	非脫而脫，二邊之所不拘，如百句解脫中說；	Not liberated yet liberated, it is not constrained by the two extremes, as explained in the Hundred-Verse Liberation.
['ZH_T38_1767_006:0069c15_15']	非縛而縛，為訥鈍邪癡闡提外道所縛，故有病行、嬰兒行，住首楞嚴示現善惡，隨所調伏眾生之處雖鄙必施，如醫療病、如華在水無染無著，名解脫德。	非縛而縛，為訥鈍邪癡闡提外道所縛，故有病行、嬰兒行，住首楞嚴示現善惡，隨所調伏眾生之處雖鄙必施，如醫療病、如華在水無染無著，名解脫德。	Not bound yet bound, it is bound by dullness, crookedness, delusion, icchantikas, and non-Buddhists. Therefore, there are sick practices, baby practices, and the śūraṃgama samādhi, which manifests good and evil, and bestows wherever it tames beings, just as a doctor treats illnesses, or a flower in the water is unstained and unattached. This is called the virtue of liberation.
