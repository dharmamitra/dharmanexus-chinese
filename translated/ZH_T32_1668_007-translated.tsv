['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b11_2']	本曰：	本曰：	007	The treatise states:
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b12_15']	分別發趣道相者，謂一切諸佛所證之道，一切菩薩發心修行趣向義故。	分別發趣道相者，謂一切諸佛所證之道，一切菩薩發心修行趣向義故。	007	As for distinguishing the characteristics of the path to be taken, it refers to the path realized by all Buddhas, because all Bodhisattvas give rise to the mind and practice in order to head towards it.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b13_4']	略說發心有三種。	略說發心有三種。	007	In brief, there are three kinds of giving rise to the mind.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b13_9']	云何為三？	云何為三？	007	What are the three?
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b14_11']	一者信成就發心、二者解行發心、三者證發心。	一者信成就發心、二者解行發心、三者證發心。	007	First, the mind that is given rise to through the accomplishment of faith; second, the mind that is given rise to through understanding and practice; third, the mind that is given rise to through realization.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b15_16']	信成就發心者，依何等人修何等行，得信成就堪能發心。	信成就發心者，依何等人修何等行，得信成就堪能發心。	007	As for the mind that is given rise to through the accomplishment of faith, based on what kind of person, cultivating what kind of practice, can one accomplish faith and be able to give rise to the mind?
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b19_6']	所謂依不定聚眾生，有熏習善根力故，信業果報能起十善，厭生死苦欲求無上菩提，得值諸佛親承供養修行信心，經一萬劫信心成就故。	所謂依不定聚眾生，有熏習善根力故，信業果報能起十善，厭生死苦欲求無上菩提，得值諸佛親承供養修行信心，經一萬劫信心成就故。	007	Namely, those sentient beings who rely on the indeterminate aggregate, due to the power of their cultivated wholesome roots, believe in the fruits of karma and are able to cultivate the ten wholesome [paths of action]. Disgusted with the suffering of birth and death, they wish to seek unsurpassed enlightenment. They encounter the buddhas, personally serve and make offerings to them, and cultivate faith and understanding. For ten thousand kalpas, their faith and understanding is perfected.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646b23_3']	諸佛菩薩教令發心，或以大悲故能自發心、或因正法欲滅以護法因緣故能自發心，如是信心成就得發心者，入正定聚畢竟不退，名住如來種中正因相應。	諸佛菩薩教令發心，或以大悲故能自發心、或因正法欲滅以護法因緣故能自發心，如是信心成就得發心者，入正定聚畢竟不退，名住如來種中正因相應。	007	The buddhas and bodhisattvas teach them to give rise to the resolve, or due to great compassion they are able to give rise to the resolve on their own, or because the true Dharma is about to perish, they are able to give rise to the resolve on their own for the sake of protecting the Dharma. Those who, in this way, perfect their faith and understanding and give rise to the resolve enter the stage of definite goodness and are ultimately irreversible. They are called those who abide in the correct causes within the lineage of the tathāgatas.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c01_16']	若有眾生善根微少，久遠已來煩惱深厚，雖值於佛亦得供養，然起人天種子、或起二乘種子，設有求大乘者，根則不定，若進若退，或有供養諸佛未經一萬劫，於中遇緣亦有發心，所謂見佛色相而發其心，或因供養眾僧而發其心、或因二乘之人教令發心、或學他發心，如是等發心悉皆不定，遇惡因緣或便退失墮二乘地。	若有眾生善根微少，久遠已來煩惱深厚，雖值於佛亦得供養，然起人天種子、或起二乘種子，設有求大乘者，根則不定，若進若退，或有供養諸佛未經一萬劫，於中遇緣亦有發心，所謂見佛色相而發其心，或因供養眾僧而發其心、或因二乘之人教令發心、或學他發心，如是等發心悉皆不定，遇惡因緣或便退失墮二乘地。	007	If there are sentient beings with little wholesome roots and deep afflictions from a long time ago, although they encounter the Buddha and make offerings, they give rise to the seeds of humans and gods, or give rise to the seeds of the two vehicles. Even if there are those who seek the Great Vehicle, their faculties are unstable, and they may advance or retreat. Some make offerings to the Buddhas for less than ten thousand kalpas, and in the meantime, they encounter conditions and give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment, such as seeing the Buddha's physical form and giving rise to the aspiration, or because of making offerings to the Sangha and giving rise to the aspiration, or because of being taught by those of the two vehicles to give rise to the aspiration, or learning from others to give rise to the aspiration. Aspirations such as these are all unstable, and encountering bad conditions, they may regress and fall into the stage of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c02_11']	復次信成就發心者發何等心？	復次信成就發心者發何等心？	007	Next, for those who give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment through accomplishing faith, what kind of mind do they give rise to?

['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c03_16']	一者直心，正念真如法故；	一者直心，正念真如法故；	007	First, the mind of straightforwardness, because one correctly contemplates the true nature of dharmas;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c04_11']	二者深心，樂集一切諸善行故；	二者深心，樂集一切諸善行故；	007	Second, the profound mind, because one delights in accumulating all wholesome practices;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c05_7']	三者大悲心，欲拔一切眾生苦故。	三者大悲心，欲拔一切眾生苦故。	007	Third, the mind of great compassion, wishing to eliminate the suffering of all sentient beings.

['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c07_2']	上說法界一相、佛體無二，何故不唯念真如，復假求學諸善之行？	上說法界一相、佛體無二，何故不唯念真如，復假求學諸善之行？	007	Above it is said that the Dharma realm has one characteristic and the Buddha's essence is non-dual. Why not only contemplate true suchness, but also rely on seeking and learning various wholesome practices?
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c07_5']	答曰：	答曰：	007	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c08_3']	譬如大摩尼寶，體性明淨而有鑛穢之垢。	譬如大摩尼寶，體性明淨而有鑛穢之垢。	007	It is like a great maṇi jewel, whose essence is bright and pure but has the defilements of ore.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c09_6']	若人雖念寶性，不以方便種種磨鍊，終無得淨。	若人雖念寶性，不以方便種種磨鍊，終無得淨。	007	Even if a person contemplates the jewel's nature, without using various methods to polish and refine it, it will never become pure.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c10_10']	如是眾生真如之法體性空淨，而有無量煩惱垢染。	如是眾生真如之法體性空淨，而有無量煩惱垢染。	007	In the same way, the true suchness of sentient beings has an essence that is empty and pure, but it is defiled by innumerable afflictions.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c11_13']	若人雖念真如，不以方便種種修習，亦無得淨。	若人雖念真如，不以方便種種修習，亦無得淨。	007	Even if a person contemplates true suchness, without using various methods to cultivate and practice it, it will also not become pure.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c12_16']	以垢無量遍一切法，故修一切善行以為對治。	以垢無量遍一切法，故修一切善行以為對治。	007	Since the defilements are innumerable and pervade all dharmas, one cultivates all wholesome practices as antidotes.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c13_17']	若人修行一切善法，自然歸順真如法故。	若人修行一切善法，自然歸順真如法故。	007	If a person cultivates all wholesome dharmas, they naturally conform to the Dharma of true suchness.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c14_7']	略說方便有四種。	略說方便有四種。	007	In brief, there are four kinds of skillful means.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c14_12']	云何為四？	云何為四？	007	What are the four?
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c16_2']	一者行根本方便，謂觀一切法自性無生，離於妄見，不住生死。	一者行根本方便，謂觀一切法自性無生，離於妄見，不住生死。	007	First, the fundamental expedient of practice, which means contemplating that all dharmas are by nature unborn, free from false views, and not dwelling in saṃsāra.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c18_6']	觀一切法因緣和合、業果不失，起於大悲，修諸福德、攝化眾生，不住涅盤，以隨順法性無住故。	觀一切法因緣和合、業果不失，起於大悲，修諸福德、攝化眾生，不住涅盤，以隨順法性無住故。	007	Contemplating that all dharmas are the combination of causes and conditions, and that karmic fruits are not lost, one gives rise to great compassion, cultivates various merits and virtues, and guides and transforms sentient beings, not dwelling in nirvāṇa, because in accordance with the nature of dharmas there is no dwelling.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c20_5']	二者能止方便，謂慚愧悔過能止一切惡法不令增長，以隨順法性離諸過故。	二者能止方便，謂慚愧悔過能止一切惡法不令增長，以隨順法性離諸過故。	007	Second, the expedient of being able to stop, which means that with a sense of shame and remorse one can stop all evil dharmas and prevent them from increasing, because in accordance with the nature of dharmas one is free from faults.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c23_3']	三者發起善根增長方便，謂懃供養禮拜三寶，讚歎隨喜勸請諸佛，以愛敬三寶淳厚心故信得增長，乃能志求無上之道。	三者發起善根增長方便，謂懃供養禮拜三寶，讚歎隨喜勸請諸佛，以愛敬三寶淳厚心故信得增長，乃能志求無上之道。	007	Third, the expedient of giving rise to and increasing wholesome roots, which means diligently making offerings and paying homage to the Three Jewels, praising, rejoicing, and requesting the Buddhas, because with a sincere and thick mind of loving and respecting the Three Jewels one's faith increases and one is able to aspire to the unsurpassed way.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c24_14']	又因佛法僧力所護故，能消業障善根不退，以隨順法性離癡障故。	又因佛法僧力所護故，能消業障善根不退，以隨順法性離癡障故。	007	Moreover, because one is protected by the power of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha, one is able to eliminate karmic hindrances and wholesome roots do not regress, because in accordance with the nature of dharmas one is free from the hindrances of delusion.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c27_9']	四者大願平等方便，所謂發願盡於未來化度一切眾生使無有餘，皆令究竟無餘涅盤，以隨順法性無斷絕故。	四者大願平等方便，所謂發願盡於未來化度一切眾生使無有餘，皆令究竟無餘涅盤，以隨順法性無斷絕故。	007	Fourth is the great vow of equality and skillful means, which refers to making vows to transform and liberate all sentient beings without remainder throughout the future, enabling them to ultimately attain nirvāṇa without remainder, in accordance with the uninterrupted nature of reality.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c28_16']	法性廣大遍一切眾生平等無二，不念彼此究竟寂滅故。	法性廣大遍一切眾生平等無二，不念彼此究竟寂滅故。	007	The nature of reality is vast and pervades all sentient beings equally, without duality, and is ultimately quiescent and extinct.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0646c29_14']	菩薩發是心故，則得少分見於法身。	菩薩發是心故，則得少分見於法身。	007	Because the bodhisattva gives rise to this mind, he is then able to partially see the Dharma body.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a01_15']	以見法身故，隨其願力能現八種利益眾生。	以見法身故，隨其願力能現八種利益眾生。	007	Because he sees the Dharma body, he is able to manifest the eight kinds of benefiting of sentient beings in accordance with his vow power.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a03_8']	所謂從兜率天退、入胎、住胎、出胎、出家、成道、轉法輪、入於涅槃。	所謂從兜率天退、入胎、住胎、出胎、出家、成道、轉法輪、入於涅槃。	007	They are: descending from Tuṣita Heaven, entering the womb, abiding in the womb, leaving the womb, going forth, attaining enlightenment, turning the wheel of Dharma, and entering nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a05_8']	然是菩薩未名法身，以其過去無量世來有漏之業未能決斷，隨其所生與微苦相應。	然是菩薩未名法身，以其過去無量世來有漏之業未能決斷，隨其所生與微苦相應。	007	However, this bodhisattva is not yet called the Dharma body, because his immeasurable karma from past lives has not yet been severed, and he experiences slight suffering in accordance with his rebirth.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a06_5']	亦非業繫，以有大順自在力故。	亦非業繫，以有大順自在力故。	007	He is also not bound by karma, because he has the great power of accord and mastery.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a08_12']	如修多羅中或說有退墮惡趣者，非其實退，但為初學菩薩未入正位，而懈怠者恐怖，令使勇猛故。	如修多羅中或說有退墮惡趣者，非其實退，但為初學菩薩未入正位，而懈怠者恐怖，令使勇猛故。	007	As it is said in the sutras that there are those who regress and fall into evil destinies, this is not true regression. It is only for the sake of frightening and inspiring those beginner bodhisattvas who have not yet entered the correct stage and are lazy.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a09_16']	又是菩薩一發心後遠離怯弱，畢竟不畏墮二乘地。	又是菩薩一發心後遠離怯弱，畢竟不畏墮二乘地。	007	Moreover, once a bodhisattva has given rise to the aspiration mind, he is far removed from cowardice and is ultimately not afraid of falling into the stage of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a12_2']	若聞無量無邊阿僧祇劫勤苦難行乃得涅槃，亦不怯弱，以信知一切法從本已來自涅槃故。	若聞無量無邊阿僧祇劫勤苦難行乃得涅槃，亦不怯弱，以信知一切法從本已來自涅槃故。	007	Even if he hears that nirvana can only be attained after immeasurable, boundless, incalculable eons of difficult and arduous practice, he is still not discouraged, because he has faith and understands that all dharmas have been self-nirvana from the very beginning.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a12_13']	解行發心者，當知轉勝。	解行發心者，當知轉勝。	007	The bodhisattva who gives rise to the aspiration mind through understanding and practice should be known as even more excellent.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a13_17']	以是菩薩從初正信已來，於第一阿僧祇劫將欲滿故。	以是菩薩從初正信已來，於第一阿僧祇劫將欲滿故。	007	This is because this bodhisattva, from the time of his initial correct faith, is about to complete the first incalculable eon.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a15_15']	於真如法中深解現前所修離相，以知法性體無慳貪故，隨順修行檀波羅蜜；	於真如法中深解現前所修離相，以知法性體無慳貪故，隨順修行檀波羅蜜；	007	Therefore, in the dharmas of suchness, he deeply understands and realizes the characteristics of the practice of detachment. Because he knows that the essence of dharma-nature is devoid of stinginess and greed, he practices the perfection of giving in accordance with his wishes;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a17_1']	以知法性無染離五欲過故，隨願修行尸波羅蜜；	以知法性無染離五欲過故，隨願修行尸波羅蜜；	007	because he knows that the dharma-nature is unstained and free from the faults of the five desires, he practices the perfection of morality in accordance with his wishes;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a18_4']	以知法性無苦離瞋惱故，隨順修行羼提波羅蜜；	以知法性無苦離瞋惱故，隨順修行羼提波羅蜜；	007	Because they know the nature of dharmas is without suffering and free from anger and distress, they practice in accordance with the perfection of forbearance;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a19_10']	以知法性無身心相離慢怠故，隨順修行毘梨耶波羅蜜；	以知法性無身心相離慢怠故，隨順修行毘梨耶波羅蜜；	007	Because they know the nature of dharmas is without the characteristics of body and mind and free from arrogance and laziness, they practice in accordance with the perfection of vigor;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a20_12']	以知法性常定體無亂故，隨順修行禪波羅蜜；	以知法性常定體無亂故，隨順修行禪波羅蜜；	007	Because they know the nature of dharmas is always in samādhi and free from confusion, they practice in accordance with the perfection of meditation;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a21_15']	以知法性體明離無明故，隨順修行般若波羅蜜。	以知法性體明離無明故，隨順修行般若波羅蜜。	007	Because they know the nature of dharmas is clear and free from ignorance, they practice in accordance with the perfection of wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a23_1']	證發心者，從淨心地乃至菩薩究竟地，證何境界？	證發心者，從淨心地乃至菩薩究竟地，證何境界？	007	As for the resolve of realization, from the stage of pure mind up to the ultimate stage of the bodhisattva, what realm is realized?
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a23_6']	所謂真如。	所謂真如。	007	It is called suchness.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a24_14']	以依轉識說為境界，而此證者無有境界，唯真如智名為法身。	以依轉識說為境界，而此證者無有境界，唯真如智名為法身。	007	It is said to be the realm based on the transforming consciousness, but for the one who realizes it, there is no realm. Only the wisdom of suchness is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a27_1']	是菩薩於一念頃，能至十方無餘世界，供養諸佛請轉法輪，唯為開導利益眾生，不依文字。	是菩薩於一念頃，能至十方無餘世界，供養諸佛請轉法輪，唯為開導利益眾生，不依文字。	007	In a single thought, this bodhisattva can reach all worlds in the ten directions without exception, make offerings to the buddhas, request them to turn the wheel of Dharma, only to guide and benefit sentient beings, not relying on words.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a28_1']	或示超地速成正覺，以為怯弱眾生故。	或示超地速成正覺，以為怯弱眾生故。	007	Or they manifest transcending the grounds and quickly attaining perfect enlightenment, for the sake of those sentient beings who are timid.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647a29_6']	或說我於無量阿僧祇劫當成佛道，以為懈慢眾生故。	或說我於無量阿僧祇劫當成佛道，以為懈慢眾生故。	007	Or they say, I will attain Buddhahood after innumerable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, for the sake of those sentient beings who are indolent.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b03_4']	能示如是無數方便不可思議，而實菩薩種性根等、發心則等、所證亦等，無有超過之法，以一切菩薩皆經三阿僧祇劫故。	能示如是無數方便不可思議，而實菩薩種性根等、發心則等、所證亦等，無有超過之法，以一切菩薩皆經三阿僧祇劫故。	007	They are able to manifest such innumerable skillful means, which are inconceivable. However, in reality, the capacities of the bodhisattvas' spiritual affinities are equal, their initial resolve is equal, and their realization is also equal, without any dharma that can be surpassed, because all bodhisattvas go through three asaṃkhyeya kalpas.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b04_13']	但隨眾生世界不同，所見所聞、根欲性異，故示所行亦有差別。	但隨眾生世界不同，所見所聞、根欲性異，故示所行亦有差別。	007	But it is only because the worlds of sentient beings are not the same, and their faculties, desires, and natures are different in what they see and hear, that the practices they manifest also have differences.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b05_13']	又是菩薩發心相者，有三種心微細之相。	又是菩薩發心相者，有三種心微細之相。	007	Moreover, the characteristics of the bodhisattvas' initial resolve are the three subtle characteristics of mind.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b05_18']	云何為三？	云何為三？	007	What are the three?
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b06_9']	一者真心，無分別故；	一者真心，無分別故；	007	First, the true mind, because it is without discrimination;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b07_5']	二者方便心，自然遍行利益眾生故；	二者方便心，自然遍行利益眾生故；	007	Second, the mind of skillful means, because it naturally and universally benefits sentient beings;
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b07_17']	三者業識心，微細起滅故。	三者業識心，微細起滅故。	007	Third, the mind of karmic consciousness, because it subtly arises and ceases.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b11_4']	又是菩薩功德成滿，於色究竟處示一切世間最高大身，謂以一念相應慧無明頓盡，名一切種智，自然而有不思議業，能現十方利益眾生。	又是菩薩功德成滿，於色究竟處示一切世間最高大身，謂以一念相應慧無明頓盡，名一切種智，自然而有不思議業，能現十方利益眾生。	007	Moreover, when the merit of this bodhisattva is complete, he manifests the highest and greatest body in the realm of form, that is, in a single thought of corresponding wisdom, ignorance is suddenly exhausted, called the wisdom of all modes, and there naturally arises inconceivable activity that can manifest in the ten directions to benefit sentient beings.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b11_7']	問曰：	問曰：	007	Question:
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b13_17']	虛空無邊故世界無邊，世界無邊故眾生無邊，眾生無邊故心行差別亦復無邊，如是境界不可分齊、難知難解。	虛空無邊故世界無邊，世界無邊故眾生無邊，眾生無邊故心行差別亦復無邊，如是境界不可分齊、難知難解。	007	Because space is boundless, the worlds are boundless. Because the worlds are boundless, sentient beings are boundless. Because sentient beings are boundless, the distinctions in their mental activities are also boundless. Such an unbounded realm is difficult to know and understand.
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b14_17']	若無明斷無有心想，云何能了名一切種智？	若無明斷無有心想，云何能了名一切種智？	007	If ignorance is severed and there is no more deluded mind, how can one understand and be called the wisdom of all modes?
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b15_2']	答曰：	答曰：	007	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1668_007:0647b17_8']	一切境界本來一心離於想念，以眾生妄見境界故心有分齊，以妄起想念不稱法性故不能了知。	一切境界本來一心離於想念，以眾生妄見境界故心有分齊，以妄起想念不稱法性故不能了知。	007	All realms are originally one mind, apart from thoughts and memories.
