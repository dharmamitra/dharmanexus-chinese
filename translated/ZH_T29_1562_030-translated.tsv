Their mode of activity is subtle and they are not abandoned in a continuous series. Therefore only these two defile birth existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_030:0509b26_3']	此二非無，然非唯此，聖結生有此不行故，亦有現起無有愛故。	此二非無，然非唯此，聖結生有此不行故，亦有現起無有愛故。	030	These two do not exist, but they are not the only ones, because these two do not occur in the holy ones in the state of rebirth, and because there is no love of existence.

There are those who hope for the annihilation of the self. Therefore these two are not frequently active. Consequently, it is definitely established that the power of the various passions of a realm defiles existence in that realm. The other intermediate existences, etc., are of three kinds, because they are all good, defiled, and indeterminate.

['ZH_T29_1562_030:0509c18_1']	如是段食，唯在欲界，離段食貪生上界故，非上界身依外緣住。	如是段食，唯在欲界，離段食貪生上界故，非上界身依外緣住。	030	Such coarse food exists only in the desire realm, because one is born in the upper realms by being free from craving for coarse food. The body in the upper realms does not depend on external conditions for sustenance.
['ZH_T29_1562_030:0509c18_19']	色界雖有能益大種而非段食，如非妙欲。	色界雖有能益大種而非段食，如非妙欲。	030	Although there is in the form realm that which benefits the primary elements, it is not coarse food, like non-excellent desires.

['ZH_T29_1562_030:0509c25_8']	若爾，欲界亦應唯口分段吞噉方名段食。	若爾，欲界亦應唯口分段吞噉方名段食。	030	If this is so, then in the realm of desire, only that which is swallowed by the mouth should be called material food.

They always smell the fragrance of the heavens, which is like a wish-fulfilling jewel, or they touch the wonderful tangibles of the wind, etc., which are also food.
['ZH_T29_1562_030:0510a03_3']	又彼身中有能益煖。	又彼身中有能益煖。	030	Also, there is a kind of heat in their bodies that benefits them.

This is said in terms of the majority and the most excellent. There is no need to raise objections about the lower realms having it and the upper realms not having it.

['ZH_T29_1562_030:0510a09_17']	雖非吞噉，但能益身令得久住，亦細食攝，猶如影光炎涼塗洗。	雖非吞噉，但能益身令得久住，亦細食攝，猶如影光炎涼塗洗。	030	Even though they are not swallowed, if they can benefit the body and cause it to remain for a long time, they are also categorized as subtle food, just like shadows, light, flames, coolness, ointments, and washing.

It becomes food only when it enters the nose and mouth, is chewed by the teeth, moistened by saliva, passes down the throat, falls into the stomach, is gradually digested, and the essence of the flavor and the potency of the digestion flow through the blood vessels, nourishing the worms. Only then is it called food, because at that time it becomes food.

Dwelling in the realm of prior existence, one can converse together, unlike insentient beings, so it is called sentient beings.

Dwelling in the realm of intermediate existence, one seeks the realm of birth, so food sustains the realm of intermediate existence, causing it to proceed to the next birth without being able to turn back, so it is called nourishing.

It is not the case that the consciousness that is neither clear nor sharp has the meaning of death and birth, because at the time of death and birth, the consciousness is necessarily dull and inferior.
