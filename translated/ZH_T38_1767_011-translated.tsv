['ZH_T38_1767_011:0103a16_19']	生育一子譬於眾生稟教生解，以解微故，故言嬰孩。	生育一子譬於眾生稟教生解，以解微故，故言嬰孩。	011	Giving birth to a child is analogous to sentient beings receiving the teachings and giving rise to understanding. Since understanding is subtle, it is called an infant.

['ZH_T38_1767_011:0103b02_7']	本意疑於我無我異，是故合藥；	本意疑於我無我異，是故合藥；	011	The original intention is to doubt the difference between self and non-self, so it combines the medicines;
['ZH_T38_1767_011:0103b02_17']	治病是旁，是故不合。	治病是旁，是故不合。	011	Treating the illness is secondary, so it does not combine them.
