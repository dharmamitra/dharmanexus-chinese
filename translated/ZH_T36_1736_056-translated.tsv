['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c01_8']	然《唯識疏》中釋云「真如實無別，隨其所證，所生能證勝德，假立十種。	然《唯識疏》中釋云「真如實無別，隨其所證，所生能證勝德，假立十種。	056	However, the Consciousness-Only Commentary explains: Suchness is truly without distinction, but according to what is realized and what is born, the superior virtues of the realizing are provisionally established as ten kinds.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c01_12']	」釋曰：	」釋曰：	056	The commentary states:

['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c03_16']	疏「又云雖初地中」下，第二借《唯識》文通賢首義。	疏「又云雖初地中」下，第二借《唯識》文通賢首義。	056	The commentary states: Moreover, it says that although in the first ground... Below this is the second borrowing of the text from the Vijñaptimātratā to explain the meaning of Xian-shou.

['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c06_1']	初地之內不達十如，應無發趣之果能達後後相及得果。	初地之內不達十如，應無發趣之果能達後後相及得果。	056	Since one does not penetrate the ten suchnesses within the first ground, one should not have the fruit of setting out, and should not be able to penetrate the subsequent characteristics and attain the fruit.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c06_15']	若已通達，何不齊證真如十德？	若已通達，何不齊證真如十德？	056	If one has already penetrated, why is it not the case that one equally realizes the ten virtues of suchness?
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c06_20']	故今答云：	故今答云：	056	Therefore, the answer now is:
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c08_14']	達即齊達，證行未圓故行位有十，故有十種圓滿真如，乃至如來十皆能了。	達即齊達，證行未圓故行位有十，故有十種圓滿真如，乃至如來十皆能了。	056	Penetrating is precisely penetrating equally, but the practice is not yet perfect, so there are ten stages of practice and ten kinds of perfect suchness, up to the Tathāgata who is able to understand all ten.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c10_6']	如《辯中邊論》廣有分別「言能證者，由於行圓，後後地行別別漸圓。	如《辯中邊論》廣有分別「言能證者，由於行圓，後後地行別別漸圓。	056	As extensively distinguished in the Madhyāntavibhāga-śāstra, it is said that the one who is able to realize is due to the perfection of practice, with the practices of the subsequent grounds gradually perfected separately.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c10_16']	」豈非約智有昧明義？	」豈非約智有昧明義？	056	How is it not the case that there is the meaning of the obscurity and brightness of wisdom?
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c12_2']	雖彼疏釋本為廢立，即以此義可通明昧，故得引之。	雖彼疏釋本為廢立，即以此義可通明昧，故得引之。	056	Although the commentary's explanation is originally for the purpose of establishing and refuting, this meaning can be used to clarify the distinction between clarity and obscurity, so it can be cited.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c13_14']	以非證論中通真如無異之義，故今疏云「亦約能證有明昧意也」。	以非證論中通真如無異之義，故今疏云「亦約能證有明昧意也」。	056	Because it is not a treatise that discusses the meaning of the non-differentiation of true suchness, the commentary now says it is also about the meaning of the clarity and obscurity of the realization.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c14_10']	疏「若唯取所證」下，第三反難成立。	疏「若唯取所證」下，第三反難成立。	056	The commentary states If only the realized is taken... This is the third counter-argument for establishing [the ten grounds].
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c14_15']	此有二難：	此有二難：	056	This has two arguments:
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c15_2']	一初地未證難。	一初地未證難。	056	The first is the argument of not yet realizing the first ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c15_17']	如有十德，初唯證一，豈是證如？	如有十德，初唯證一，豈是證如？	056	If there are ten virtues, and only one is realized in the beginning, how can it be said to be realizing suchness?
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c16_4']	二不通本難難。	二不通本難難。	056	The second argument is the argument of not being able to encompass the basis.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c16_9']	謂本難云：	謂本難云：	056	The original argument states:
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c16_19']	如本無異，何有十證？	如本無異，何有十證？	056	If the basis is no different, how can there be ten realizations?
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c17_2']	今云：	今云：	056	Now it is said:
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c18_4']	當地證於一德名親證者，無異之難豈得免耶？	當地證於一德名親證者，無異之難豈得免耶？	056	If it is said that realizing one virtue in the ground is called direct realization, how can the argument of non-differentiation be avoided?
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c19_1']	疏「如人觀空」下，第四以喻顯示。	疏「如人觀空」下，第四以喻顯示。	056	The commentary states It is like a person observing the sky... This is the fourth illustration.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c20_14']	眼有小大、空無差別，是故生公依於此理立頓悟義，明唯佛悟證如窮故。	眼有小大、空無差別，是故生公依於此理立頓悟義，明唯佛悟證如窮故。	056	The eyes have small and large, but the emptiness has no distinction. Therefore, Master Sheng relies on this principle to establish the meaning of sudden enlightenment, clarifying that only the Buddha's enlightenment and realization of suchness is ultimate.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c22_4']	十地聖賢皆為信境，未全證如，故云「夫稱頓者，明理不可分。	十地聖賢皆為信境，未全證如，故云「夫稱頓者，明理不可分。	056	The sages and worthies of the ten grounds are all objects of faith, and have not yet fully realized suchness. Therefore, it is said, As for the term 'sudden,' it clarifies that the principle cannot be divided.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c22_9']	悟語極照。	悟語極照。	056	The word 'enlightenment' means ultimate illumination.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c23_1']	以頓明悟，義不容二。	以頓明悟，義不容二。	056	Using 'sudden' to clarify enlightenment, the meaning does not allow for two.
['ZH_T36_1736_056:0440c24_1']	不二之悟符不分之理，理智兼釋謂之頓悟。	不二之悟符不分之理，理智兼釋謂之頓悟。	056	The non-dual enlightenment accords with the indivisible principle. The principle and wisdom are both explained as 'sudden enlightenment.'

['ZH_T36_1736_056:0447b13_10']	若依大乘，慧心明勝一念能斷，但相續始終方盡究竟，故經說言「念念具足一切助道」。	若依大乘，慧心明勝一念能斷，但相續始終方盡究竟，故經說言「念念具足一切助道」。	056	If based on the Mahayana, the mind of wisdom is bright and superior, able to cut off in a single thought, but only when the continuity is complete from beginning to end is it ultimately exhausted and perfected.
