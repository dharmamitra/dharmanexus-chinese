They are attached to the six bonds and obstructions, and because they act with the fleshly eye, they do not see the fundamental retribution of karmic responses, and call it non-existent.

The fleshly eye is deluded, leaving old bonds and forming new ones. Disturbed by the four pains, they ultimately cannot recognize the fundamental retribution of karmic responses that follows one's actions.

It is like having no hands wanting to write, or having no eyes wanting to see, it is ultimately impossible.

As it grows up, the six faculties are fully developed, and the consciousness also follows the body, with desires and habits arising daily, flourishing and complete. As it reaches old age, the four great elements become weak and emaciated, and the consciousness also becomes unclear, with the six faculties decreasing.
