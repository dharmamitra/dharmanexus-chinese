['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c18_0']	三明判中自二：列章竟，次釋。初章中二：	三明判中自二：列章竟，次釋。初章中二：	018	The third, the explanation, has two parts: listing the chapters and then explaining. The first chapter has two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c19_13']	先分別能所麁妙，次問答釋疑。	先分別能所麁妙，次問答釋疑。	018	First, distinguishing the coarse and subtle of the able and the objects, next, resolving doubts through questions and answers.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c19_17']	初文二：	初文二：	018	The first text has two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c20_18']	先略立能所，次以兩種四句分別，前教、次味。	先略立能所，次以兩種四句分別，前教、次味。	018	First, briefly establishing the able and the objects, next, distinguishing with two kinds of four statements, first the previous teachings, next the flavors.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c21_7']	前四句者，列、釋。	前四句者，列、釋。	018	The first four statements are listed and explained.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c23_2']	若以理為言則一麁一妙，詮理之教巧拙不同，故使通妙理之教別教仍麁。	若以理為言則一麁一妙，詮理之教巧拙不同，故使通妙理之教別教仍麁。	018	If using principle as the words, then one coarse and one subtle, the teachings that expound principle are not the same in skillfulness, thus causing the general subtle principle teachings to still be coarse in the separate teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c25_1']	次四句者皆約味判，判彼部中能所麁妙，「不帶麁能所是乳」者，為成四句一往語耳。	次四句者皆約味判，判彼部中能所麁妙，「不帶麁能所是乳」者，為成四句一往語耳。	018	The next four statements are all about judging the flavors, judging the coarse and subtle of the able and the objects in that chapter, not bringing the coarse able and objects is the milk is just a general statement to form the four statements.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0941c25_19']	故此句中但云「無有真諦能所」故云也。	故此句中但云「無有真諦能所」故云也。	018	Therefore, in this statement it just says there is no true principle able and objects and thus it is said.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a01_1']	仍有別教能通之麁，「自有帶麁所不帶麁能」者，且云般若本是融門，二乘寄此而入真諦，雖有但真所通之麁，而無詮真能通三藏，此亦約部大分為言，若隨二乘當分所見。	仍有別教能通之麁，「自有帶麁所不帶麁能」者，且云般若本是融門，二乘寄此而入真諦，雖有但真所通之麁，而無詮真能通三藏，此亦約部大分為言，若隨二乘當分所見。	018	There are still the coarse that can be penetrated by the separate teachings. There are those that are coarse and those that are not coarse means that prajñā is originally the gate of merging. The two vehicles rely on this to enter the truth. Although there is the coarseness that is penetrated by the mere truth, there is no teaching of the truth that can penetrate the Tripiṭaka. This is also spoken in terms of the general division of the teachings. If it is according to the views of the two vehicles,
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a02_13']	非無能詮即空麁教，自有帶麁能等者，能通從於通教中來，故名為麁；	非無能詮即空麁教，自有帶麁能等者，能通從於通教中來，故名為麁；	018	there is not no coarse teaching that can be immediately emptied. There are those that are coarse and those that are not coarse means that the ability to penetrate comes from the common teachings, and is therefore called coarse;
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a03_8']	所通即是別圓中道，故名為妙。	所通即是別圓中道，故名為妙。	018	that which is penetrated is the middle way within the separate and perfect teachings, and is therefore called wonderful.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a05_15']	「涅槃中諸門亦是」者，涅槃部中前之三教能通之門，名之為麁，並不住真及以教道俱入三德，故所通妙。	「涅槃中諸門亦是」者，涅槃部中前之三教能通之門，名之為麁，並不住真及以教道俱入三德，故所通妙。	018	The various gates within the Nirvana Sutra are also like this means that the gates that can penetrate within the Nirvana Sutra, which are the first three teachings, are called coarse, and all enter the three virtues, neither abiding in the truth nor in the teaching path, and are therefore called wonderful.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a06_8']	次釋疑中，先問，次答。	次釋疑中，先問，次答。	018	Next, in explaining the doubts, first there is a question, and then an answer.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a06_11']	中三：	中三：	018	There are three parts in the middle:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a10_7']	先通明其意，次「何者」下歷教解釋，三「今拓」下明用門之意，一一教中皆作三對四一不同及判門意，所言三者即教行理通別之相，具如第二卷初當分通別即其義也。	先通明其意，次「何者」下歷教解釋，三「今拓」下明用門之意，一一教中皆作三對四一不同及判門意，所言三者即教行理通別之相，具如第二卷初當分通別即其義也。	018	First, generally clarify its meaning, next, below What is it? explain it according to the teachings, third, below Now, expanding clarify the meaning of using the gate. In each teaching, there are three pairs and four ones that are different, and the meaning of dividing the gate is explained. What is meant by three? It refers to the general and specific characteristics of teaching, practice, and principle. It is the same as the meaning of general and specific within each part in the beginning of the second fascicle.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a11_1']	皆以四故名別，一故名通。	皆以四故名別，一故名通。	018	All are called specific because of the four, and general because of the one.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a15_8']	今以此之通別判於狹小，若藏別兩教教行理三皆悉是狹，若通圓兩教教行不狹而教行取理不當，故名理為狹，是則四教皆以教主及所詮理名之為一，以所被機及能詮教名之為四。	今以此之通別判於狹小，若藏別兩教教行理三皆悉是狹，若通圓兩教教行不狹而教行取理不當，故名理為狹，是則四教皆以教主及所詮理名之為一，以所被機及能詮教名之為四。	018	Now, using this general and specific to divide the narrow and small, if the two separate teachings of the three vehicles and the common teaching are the narrow and small, if the two complete teachings of the bodhisattvas and the perfect teaching are the broad and great, then the three of teaching, practice, and principle in the two separate teachings are all narrow and small. If the teaching and practice in the two general teachings are not narrow, but the teaching and practice do not accord with the principle, then the principle is called narrow. This means that the four teachings are all called one based on the teacher of the teaching and the principle expounded, and are called four based on the beings to be reached and the teaching that can be expounded.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a16_12']	是故經言「一門」者，一是四家之門，故云「一門」。	是故經言「一門」者，一是四家之門，故云「一門」。	018	Therefore, the sūtra says one gate. One is the gate of the four families, so it is called one gate.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a17_11']	言「依經文」者，依今經即是以圓教行取理難當。	言「依經文」者，依今經即是以圓教行取理難當。	018	As for relying on the sutra text, relying on the present sutra is to take the principle of practice in the perfect teaching as difficult to handle.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a21_3']	三明用門意中言「開拓」等者，今開圓經一句而作四解遍一代教，故云「處處」，則識前之三教教行理三狹小復麁，後之一教教行理三狹小俱妙。	三明用門意中言「開拓」等者，今開圓經一句而作四解遍一代教，故云「處處」，則識前之三教教行理三狹小復麁，後之一教教行理三狹小俱妙。	018	In the third, clarifying the meaning of the approach, it says opening up and so on. Now, opening up a single phrase of the perfect sutra and making four interpretations that pervade the teachings of all ages is called everywhere. Then, one recognizes that the three of teaching, practice, and principle in the previous three teachings are narrow and small, and also coarse, while the three of teaching, practice, and principle in the latter single teaching are narrow and small, and also subtle.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a23_7']	作此釋者，意云四門是教、十觀是行，皆通至極，恐人不了狹小之言謂一向麁，故須此簡。	作此釋者，意云四門是教、十觀是行，皆通至極，恐人不了狹小之言謂一向麁，故須此簡。	018	The meaning of this interpretation is that the four approaches are the teaching, and the ten contemplations are the practice, both of which penetrate to the ultimate. Fearing that people may not understand the word narrow and small to mean entirely coarse, therefore this distinction is necessary.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a23_17']	若約五味，意亦可知。	若約五味，意亦可知。	018	If it is discussed in terms of the five flavors, the meaning can also be understood.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a24_4']	次約諸門中二：	次約諸門中二：	018	Next, in discussing the various approaches, there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a24_12']	先約教，次約味。	先約教，次約味。	018	First, discussing in terms of the teachings, and next, discussing in terms of the flavors.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a26_4']	先約教中四教不同，一一教皆有教行二判，教謂四教，行謂門中十觀。	先約教中四教不同，一一教皆有教行二判，教謂四教，行謂門中十觀。	018	First, in discussing in terms of the teachings, the four teachings are different. Each teaching has two kinds of distinctions: teaching and practice. The teaching refers to the four teachings, and the practice refers to the ten contemplations in the approach.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a26_9']	教又二義：	教又二義：	018	The teaching also has two meanings:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a26_17']	一約門，二約悉。	一約門，二約悉。	018	First, in terms of the gate, second, in terms of the perfection.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a27_3']	初三藏中三：	初三藏中三：	018	The first, in the Tripiṭaka, there are three:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942a29_2']	先且通論，無復麁妙，以教門俱妙從能通故，若執皆麁從計情故，此就當教為語。	先且通論，無復麁妙，以教門俱妙從能通故，若執皆麁從計情故，此就當教為語。	018	First, generally discussing, there is no coarse or subtle, because the teaching gate is all subtle, following the able to penetrate, if grasping, all are coarse, following the attachment of thought, this is based on the teaching itself to speak.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b01_7']	次別論者，從「若從法為語」去互相形比則有前麁後妙。	次別論者，從「若從法為語」去互相形比則有前麁後妙。	018	Next, the specific discussion, from If following the Dharma to speak onwards, mutually comparing, there is the previous coarseness and the later subtlety.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b02_17']	言「為鈍根說生空」等者，此是三藏生法二空，具如《止觀》第六記。	言「為鈍根說生空」等者，此是三藏生法二空，具如《止觀》第六記。	018	Speaking of for the dull-witted explaining the emptiness of beings and so forth, this is the Tripiṭaka's emptiness of beings and dharmas, fully as in the sixth record of the Śamathavipaśyanā.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b05_15']	準理二門俱得二空，一往從便，有門附俗為生空，空門附真為法空，二空名同意義永異，是故生空義歸於有法空，方乃義順於空。	準理二門俱得二空，一往從便，有門附俗為生空，空門附真為法空，二空名同意義永異，是故生空義歸於有法空，方乃義順於空。	018	According to principle, the two gates both attain the two emptinesses, provisionally following the convenience, the gate of existence following the mundane to be the emptiness of beings, the gate of emptiness following the true to be the emptiness of dharmas, the names of the two emptinesses have the same meaning but the principles are completely different, therefore the meaning of the emptiness of beings returns to existence, the emptiness of dharmas only then the meaning accords with emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b06_9']	三「今約」下從行所宜以判麁妙。	三「今約」下從行所宜以判麁妙。	018	Third, below now in terms of onwards, from the suitability of practice to determine the coarse and subtle.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b07_4']	次約四悉中四悉文相可見。	次約四悉中四悉文相可見。	018	Next, in terms of the four siddhāntas, the textual characteristics of the four siddhāntas can be seen.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b07_14']	一門既爾，餘門亦然。	一門既爾，餘門亦然。	018	Since one gate is like this, the other gates are also the same.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b08_18']	次約十觀中初三藏者，若門中有觀為妙、無觀為麁。	次約十觀中初三藏者，若門中有觀為妙、無觀為麁。	018	Next, in the ten contemplations, the first is the Tripiṭaka. If there is contemplation in the gate, it is wonderful; if there is no contemplation, it is coarse.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b10_17']	次通教，通論無通無塞，次別論有通有塞，有通有塞即四門四悉，十觀具如三藏中。	次通教，通論無通無塞，次別論有通有塞，有通有塞即四門四悉，十觀具如三藏中。	018	Next, the Shared Teaching. In general discussion, there is no penetration and no obstruction. Next, in specific discussion, there is penetration and there is obstruction. Penetration and obstruction are the four gates and four kinds of circumstances. The ten contemplations are complete as in the Tripiṭaka.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b11_17']	次別中亦應明通不論通塞，但是文略故云。	次別中亦應明通不論通塞，但是文略故云。	018	Next, in the Distinct Teaching, one should also clarify the Shared Teaching, but does not discuss penetration and obstruction. It is only because the text is abbreviated that it says so.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b13_16']	若論法相，既有「若論」之言，即是置通從別，別中亦有約四門教及以根性并十觀法。	若論法相，既有「若論」之言，即是置通從別，別中亦有約四門教及以根性并十觀法。	018	If discussing the characteristics of dharmas, since there are the words if discussing, this is setting aside the Shared and following the Distinct. In the Distinct there are also the four gates of teaching, the capacities of beings, and the ten contemplations.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b14_3']	十觀中二：	十觀中二：	018	In the ten contemplations there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b15_2']	初約十觀，次「迦羅迦果則有九分」下判。	初約十觀，次「迦羅迦果則有九分」下判。	018	First, about the ten contemplations. Next, below The karaka fruit has nine parts, it is judged.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b17_5']	「鎮頭迦羅」者，《大經》文意以林譬寺，以果譬僧，以採者譬請僧之人，明僧相相似真偽難分；	「鎮頭迦羅」者，《大經》文意以林譬寺，以果譬僧，以採者譬請僧之人，明僧相相似真偽難分；	018	As for tindrākṣa, the meaning of the text of the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra is that the forest is likened to the temple, the fruit is likened to the monks, and the gatherer is likened to the person who invites the monks, clarifying that the characteristics of the monks are similar and true and false are difficult to distinguish;
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b17_15']	今借譬十乘邪正須判。	今借譬十乘邪正須判。	018	Now, borrowing it as a metaphor for the ten vehicles, the correct and the false must be distinguished.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b18_1']	第六云：	第六云：	018	The sixth says:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b18_6']	「善男子！	「善男子！	018	Good sons!
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b19_15']	如迦羅林其樹眾多，林中唯有一樹名鎮頭迦，二果相似不可分別。	如迦羅林其樹眾多，林中唯有一樹名鎮頭迦，二果相似不可分別。	018	In the Kāraṇḍa forest, there are many trees, and in the forest there is only one tree called tinduka, and the two fruits are similar and cannot be distinguished.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b21_12']	其果熟時有一女人皆悉拾取，鎮頭迦果唯有一分，迦羅迦果乃有九分。	其果熟時有一女人皆悉拾取，鎮頭迦果唯有一分，迦羅迦果乃有九分。	018	When the fruit is ripe, a woman picks them all, and the tinduka fruit is only one part, while the kāraṇḍa fruit is nine parts.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b22_16']	女人不識將來詣市，凡愚不識買迦羅迦噉已命終。	女人不識將來詣市，凡愚不識買迦羅迦噉已命終。	018	The woman does not know and brings them to the market. The foolish do not know and buy the kāraṇḍa fruit. After eating it, they die.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b23_7']	有智人輩問是女人：	有智人輩問是女人：	018	The wise ask the woman:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b23_16']	汝於何處得是果來？	汝於何處得是果來？	018	Where did you get this fruit?
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b24_4']	女人答言：	女人答言：	018	The woman replies:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b24_13']	於彼林中得是果來。	於彼林中得是果來。	018	I got this fruit from that forest.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b25_2']	諸人聞已即言：	諸人聞已即言：	018	When the people hear this, they say:
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b26_3']	彼方多有無量迦羅迦樹，唯有一株鎮頭迦樹。	彼方多有無量迦羅迦樹，唯有一株鎮頭迦樹。	018	In that place there are many karīra trees, with only one tinduka tree.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b26_12']	諸人知已笑而捨去。	諸人知已笑而捨去。	018	The people, knowing this, laugh and leave.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942b28_1']	」下文合譬，以畜八不淨者為迦羅迦，以清淨眾為鎮頭迦。	」下文合譬，以畜八不淨者為迦羅迦，以清淨眾為鎮頭迦。	018	The text below combines the parable, taking those who keep the eight impure things as karīra, and taking the pure assembly as tinduka.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942c02_7']	今以十觀合於十分，若十分善巧則十分鎮頭，若從偏小及外道中得是觀法則十分迦羅，若用三教方便觀法則節級遞判迦羅鎮頭云云。	今以十觀合於十分，若十分善巧則十分鎮頭，若從偏小及外道中得是觀法則十分迦羅，若用三教方便觀法則節級遞判迦羅鎮頭云云。	018	Now, using the ten contemplations to combine with the ten parts, if the ten parts are skillful, then all are tinduka. If one obtains this contemplation method from biased lesser vehicles and non-Buddhist teachings, then all are karīra. If one uses the contemplation methods of the three teachings' skillful means, then one can judge karīra and tinduka in sequence.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942c06_3']	是則教主如林，觀法如果，採果女人如弘教者，詣市譬於說法之堂，買果之人譬聽法眾，愚人受教不窮教主，智者審問邪正自分，命終即譬失於正諦。	是則教主如林，觀法如果，採果女人如弘教者，詣市譬於說法之堂，買果之人譬聽法眾，愚人受教不窮教主，智者審問邪正自分，命終即譬失於正諦。	018	This means that the teacher of the teaching is like the forest, the contemplation methods are like the fruits. The woman who gathers the fruits is like one who spreads the teaching. Going to the market is like the Dharma hall where the teaching is given. The people who buy the fruits are like the assembly that listens to the Dharma. Foolish people accept the teaching without exhausting the teacher's meaning. Wise people examine the right and wrong for themselves. Dying is like losing the right truth.

Next, clarify the differences in capacities for the four siddhāntas. Third, below This is based on, again conclude the perfect gate's discernment of the coarse and wondrous meaning.

['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942c11_5']	次文者，先徵起，若依圓門，四尚非四，豈況更有門中四悉根性不融耶？	次文者，先徵起，若依圓門，四尚非四，豈況更有門中四悉根性不融耶？	018	Next, the text first raises a question. If based on the perfect gate, the four are not even four, how much more so are there no four kinds of capacities for the four siddhāntas within the gate that are not fused?
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0942c12_3']	但由物情各殊，故使門中四緣各異。	但由物情各殊，故使門中四緣各異。	018	But it is due to the differences in people's dispositions that the four conditions within the gate are each different.

This means it is at the beginning and does not encompass the end, so it says not encompassing the beginning and end.

['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c10_11']	言「乖文」者，今經本迹各立因果以為經宗，具如下引本迹二文，故知乖文。	言「乖文」者，今經本迹各立因果以為經宗，具如下引本迹二文，故知乖文。	018	As for contradicting the text, the main point of this sutra is that the original and traces each establish cause and effect. It is fully explained below in the two texts on the original and traces. Therefore, it is known to contradict the text.

['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c13_13']	以遠公棄果而存因，龍師棄因而存果，觀既有始有盛即是兩存，仍非全當，故亦不依。	以遠公棄果而存因，龍師棄因而存果，觀既有始有盛即是兩存，仍非全當，故亦不依。	018	Because Master Yuan abandons the effect and preserves the cause, and Master Long abandons the cause and preserves the effect. Since Guan already has a beginning and a flourishing, it is the preservation of both, but it is still not entirely correct, so it is also not relied upon.

['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c19_13']	破印師中云「加境闕果」者，此乃從容許其用智，智通因果，稍似經宗；	破印師中云「加境闕果」者，此乃從容許其用智，智通因果，稍似經宗；	018	In the refutation of Master Yin, it says adding the realm lacks the fruition. This is a tentative allowance of using wisdom, where wisdom encompasses cause and effect, slightly resembling the main purport of the sūtra;
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c20_12']	若望三法，然但在因而闕於果，況復加境？	若望三法，然但在因而闕於果，況復加境？	018	If compared to the three dharmas, it is only in the cause and lacks the fruition. Moreover, it adds the realm.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c21_8']	境屬於體，將陪宗義腫不益肥。	境屬於體，將陪宗義腫不益肥。	018	The realm belongs to the essence, and adding it to the main purport is like adding fat to a tumor.

['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c25_17']	次破用名中言「此是地師用八識極果」者，指向不異惑染不與染俱，今尚破攝師，攝師所破既非能破，非今經宗。	次破用名中言「此是地師用八識極果」者，指向不異惑染不與染俱，今尚破攝師，攝師所破既非能破，非今經宗。	018	Next, in refuting the use of the name, it says This is the land master's use of the eight consciousnesses as the ultimate fruit. The previous direction is not different from deluded defilement and not associated with defilement. Now it still refutes the master of inclusion. Since what is refuted by the master of inclusion is not the refutation, it is not the main purport of the present sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c28_1']	次破常住為宗者，上句且與而言非我今宗所顯，若是所顯所顯非宗，不覆亦非未為全當。	次破常住為宗者，上句且與而言非我今宗所顯，若是所顯所顯非宗，不覆亦非未為全當。	018	Next, refuting permanence as the main purport, the previous sentence is said to be not what is manifested by my present main purport. If it is what is manifested, what is manifested is not the main purport. Not covering is also not completely correct.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0944c28_9']	破次師準上可知。	破次師準上可知。	018	The refutation of the next master can be understood according to the above.

The next text has two layers of fact and principle, but only describes the present and does not discuss the past. Since it says to abide in the double negation and reveal the one, therefore there is no past to discuss. The same is true for covering the three.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b11_7']	三既被覆無三可述，所以文中但語除病，謂除執三之病法何所傷？	三既被覆無三可述，所以文中但語除病，謂除執三之病法何所傷？	018	Since the three are already covered, there are no three to be mentioned. Therefore, the text only speaks of removing the illness, meaning removing the illness of clinging to the three. What harm is there in the Dharma?
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b13_17']	所言「但除其病」者，病謂執權為實，法謂一切權法，執權之病若除，即此權法是實，是故除病不須除法。	所言「但除其病」者，病謂執權為實，法謂一切權法，執權之病若除，即此權法是實，是故除病不須除法。	018	As for the phrase only removing the illness, illness refers to clinging to the provisional as real. Dharma refers to all provisional dharmas. If the illness of clinging to the provisional is removed, then these provisional dharmas are real. Therefore, in removing the illness, there is no need to remove the Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b16_6']	第二結意中云「為顯十妙之用略言十」等者，初迹中用對迹中十妙者，具依前釋十妙之文，準望自了。	第二結意中云「為顯十妙之用略言十」等者，初迹中用對迹中十妙者，具依前釋十妙之文，準望自了。	018	In the second conclusion, it says to reveal the function of the ten wondrousnesses, I briefly mention ten... The function in the initial traces corresponds to the ten wondrousnesses in the traces. It is fully based on the previous explanation of the text of the ten wondrousnesses, and can be understood by oneself.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b17_6']	次十妙者，破既破情以顯於妙，故用智妙。	次十妙者，破既破情以顯於妙，故用智妙。	018	Next, the ten wondrousnesses are as follows: Since the destruction has already destroyed the emotions and revealed the wondrousness, it uses the wondrousness of wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b18_1']	廢既廢教，教是所說，故用說妙。	廢既廢教，教是所說，故用說妙。	018	Since the abolition has already abolished the teachings, the teachings are what is spoken, so it uses the wondrousness of speaking.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b19_1']	開既約理，理即境也，會既約行，應用行妙。	開既約理，理即境也，會既約行，應用行妙。	018	Since the revelation is already about principle, principle is the realm, and since the reconciliation is already about practice, it should use the wondrousness of practice.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b20_5']	住既元是佛之本意，佛之本意唯用一乘，故是乘妙也。	住既元是佛之本意，佛之本意唯用一乘，故是乘妙也。	018	Since abiding is originally the Buddha's fundamental intention, and the Buddha's fundamental intention only uses the One Vehicle, therefore this vehicle is marvelous.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b21_11']	住三既其約佛權智，權即起應隨機逗物，故用感應妙也。	住三既其約佛權智，權即起應隨機逗物，故用感應妙也。	018	Since the three abidings are based on the Buddha's expedient wisdom, expedients arise in response to beings according to their capacities, and therefore they employ the marvelous response and accord.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b24_2']	住非三非一者，法性不當權之與實，人天之乘非三教之權，非實理之一，非此雙非何能起通，故用神通。	住非三非一者，法性不當權之與實，人天之乘非三教之權，非實理之一，非此雙非何能起通，故用神通。	018	The non-three and non-one abiding is the Dharma-nature not corresponding to expedients or reality, and the human and heavenly vehicles are not the expedients of the three teachings, nor are they the one of the true principle. If it is not this double negation, how can it give rise to the universal? Therefore they employ spiritual powers.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b25_14']	覆三是用位妙者，三法恒須是故須覆，覆三麁位即是用於常住妙位。	覆三是用位妙者，三法恒須是故須覆，覆三麁位即是用於常住妙位。	018	The three concealments are the use of the marvelous stage. The three dharmas must always be so, and therefore they must be concealed. Concealing the three coarse stages is the use of the marvelous stage of permanence.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b27_5']	住三是用眷屬妙者，權同於三而常顯一，非妙眷屬則無此用。	住三是用眷屬妙者，權同於三而常顯一，非妙眷屬則無此用。	018	The three abidings are the use of the marvelous retinue. Expediently the same as the three, while always manifesting the One, without the marvelous retinue there would be no such use.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947b28_14']	住一是用利益妙者，如住一地而用三益，終令得於一實之益。	住一是用利益妙者，如住一地而用三益，終令得於一實之益。	018	The one abiding is the use of the marvelous benefit. Like abiding in one stage while using the three benefits, ultimately causing them to attain the benefit of the One Truth.

The first four texts all first narrate the traces, next clarify the traces, and the last six texts dwell in the basis and manifest the basis.

The meaning of the quoted text is that when not leaving the basis, the Saha world is used to manifest the basis Saha world. Always abiding below concludes, and the meaning of the text can be known.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947c22_12']	住迹中秖於迹中顯一之時已現古佛之塔，正為顯本故也。	住迹中秖於迹中顯一之時已現古佛之塔，正為顯本故也。	018	As for abiding in the traces, it is precisely that when manifesting the one in the traces, the stupa of the ancient Buddha is already manifested, precisely for the sake of manifesting the basis.

The text omits abiding in the traces and manifesting the basis. According to the meaning of the ten uses of the traces matching the ten wondrousnesses, and also taking the previously opened and combined meanings, bringing them here to examine and understand, then one will know the error in the text.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0947c28_16']	此中應將破開會三以之為因，故前迹中破約智、開約境、會約行此三屬因，位通因果；	此中應將破開會三以之為因，故前迹中破約智、開約境、會約行此三屬因，位通因果；	018	Here, the three of breaking, revealing, and reconciling should be taken as the causes. Therefore, in the previous traces, breaking is about wisdom, revealing is about the realm, and reconciling is about practice. These three belong to the causes, while the stages are common to both causes and effects.
['ZH_T33_1717_018:0948a03_9']	本門開果以出國土，故覆迹顯本對前迹門覆三顯一，前是位妙故，今應對果妙，更加住迹顯本為感應妙，以住非迹非本為神通妙，文則相當或別有意也。	本門開果以出國土，故覆迹顯本對前迹門覆三顯一，前是位妙故，今應對果妙，更加住迹顯本為感應妙，以住非迹非本為神通妙，文則相當或別有意也。	018	The revealed fruit in the original gate comes out of the lands. Therefore, covering the traces and revealing the origin correspond to the previous trace gate of covering the three and revealing the one. Since the previous one is the wonderful stage, now it should correspond to the wonderful fruit. Moreover, abiding in the traces and revealing the origin is the wonderful response.
