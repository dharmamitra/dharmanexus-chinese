This sūtra was taught on Laṅkā Mountain in the Southern Sea.

It is to clarify that by understanding the objects as empty, the mind-ocean is naturally tranquil. When mind and objects are both tranquil, there is nothing that is not illuminated.

It does not allow their minds to plant seeds in emptiness, nor does it allow their minds to be like spoiled seeds.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0723b13_3']	《解深密經》乃是入惑之初門，《楞伽》、《維摩》直示惑之本實。	《解深密經》乃是入惑之初門，《楞伽》、《維摩》直示惑之本實。	001	The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra is the initial gateway to entering afflictions, while the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra directly reveal the true nature of afflictions.

The Tathāgata presses the ground with his toe, and then the world system consisting of a triple-thousand great one-thousand worlds is adorned with hundreds of thousands of precious treasures, like the land adorned with the immeasurable merits and precious treasures of the Ratnagarbha Buddha. The entire great assembly exclaims that it has never seen such a thing before, and they all see themselves sitting on jeweled lotus flowers. However, the matter of the adornments of the inexhaustible Buddha lands being contained within a single hair is not yet explained.

In each ocean of worlds, there are inexhaustible oceans of worlds, the Buddha's realm and the realm of sentient beings in the ten directions are perfectly interpenetrating and unobstructed, adorned with myriad treasures like light and shadow, as extensively explained in the sutra;

['ZH_T36_1739_001:0723c20_5']	八千菩薩、五百聲聞、百千天人，維摩詰致其右手掌，擎其大眾往詣菴羅。	八千菩薩、五百聲聞、百千天人，維摩詰致其右手掌，擎其大眾往詣菴羅。	001	Eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred śrāvakas, and a hundred thousand celestial beings, Vimalakīrti held them in the palm of his right hand, lifted up the great assembly, and went to the mango grove.

['ZH_T36_1739_001:0723c24_16']	為權教聲聞菩薩等見道未實、自他未亡，所現神變依根所見，皆有往來分齊限量。	為權教聲聞菩薩等見道未實、自他未亡，所現神變依根所見，皆有往來分齊限量。	001	It is because the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas of the provisional teachings have not yet realized the truth of seeing the path, and self and other have not yet been eliminated. The spiritual transformations they manifest are all seen according to their faculties, with a definite scope and limit.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0723c26_10']	又是一時之間聖意，以神力變化起諸小根令漸增進故，非是法爾力故。	又是一時之間聖意，以神力變化起諸小根令漸增進故，非是法爾力故。	001	Moreover, it is the sage's intention for a period of time to use spiritual powers to transform and give rise to various small capacities, causing them to gradually progress, not by the power of inherent nature.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0723c29_17']	如《華嚴經》中，以本法力，法如是故，能以一塵之內含容十方一切佛剎眾生剎總在塵中，世界不小、微塵不大，十方世界所有微塵，一一塵中總皆如是。	如《華嚴經》中，以本法力，法如是故，能以一塵之內含容十方一切佛剎眾生剎總在塵中，世界不小、微塵不大，十方世界所有微塵，一一塵中總皆如是。	001	As in the Flower Ornament Sutra, by the power of the fundamental Dharma, the Dharma is like this, able to contain all the buddha lands and sentient beings of the ten directions within a single particle, with the worlds not small and the particles not large, and all the particles in the ten directions are all like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0724a02_12']	如經所說，菩薩於一小眾生身中成等正覺、廣度眾生，其小眾生不知不覺。	如經所說，菩薩於一小眾生身中成等正覺、廣度眾生，其小眾生不知不覺。	001	As the sutra says, the bodhisattva attains perfect enlightenment in the body of a single small sentient being and widely delivers sentient beings, while the small sentient being does not know or realize it.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0724a03_17']	當知佛以權教引小根故，身外見佛現神通力而有來去；	當知佛以權教引小根故，身外見佛現神通力而有來去；	001	One should know that the Buddha uses provisional teachings to guide those of small capacities, so they see the Buddha's manifestation of spiritual powers coming and going outside the body;

['ZH_T36_1739_001:0724a08_10']	是故毘盧遮那佛不移本處而身遍坐一切道場，十方來眾不移本處而隨化往，都無來去，亦無神力所致，是故經言「法如是故」。	是故毘盧遮那佛不移本處而身遍坐一切道場，十方來眾不移本處而隨化往，都無來去，亦無神力所致，是故經言「法如是故」。	001	Therefore, Vairocana Buddha does not move from his original place yet his body universally sits in all the sites of enlightenment. The assembly coming from the ten directions does not move from their original place yet they go with the transformation. There is no coming or going at all, and there is also no divine power that causes it. Therefore, the sūtra says, Because the Dharma is like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0724a10_7']	經中每言「以佛神力，法如是故」者，以佛神力，推佛為尊，法如是故，推其本德都無變化。	經中每言「以佛神力，法如是故」者，以佛神力，推佛為尊，法如是故，推其本德都無變化。	001	In the sūtra, it is often said, By the Buddha's spiritual power, because the Dharma is like this. Using the Buddha's spiritual power, the Buddha is promoted as the most venerable. Because the Dharma is like this, his original virtues are promoted. There is no transformation at all.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0724a12_16']	一一國剎身心性相，以依本故、不隨妄故，大小諸境皆如光如影，互相映徹周遍十方，都無往來、都無分齊。	一一國剎身心性相，以依本故、不隨妄故，大小諸境皆如光如影，互相映徹周遍十方，都無往來、都無分齊。	001	Each country, realm, body, mind, nature, and characteristics, because they rely on the basis and do not follow delusion, the various realms, large and small, are all like light and shadow, mutually penetrating and pervading the ten directions. There is no coming or going at all, and there is no division at all.

['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725b12_11']	如《華嚴經》即不然，教主則是毘盧遮那為教主故，即是法報理智真身，具無量相海功德之所莊嚴，三世諸佛同為一際一時法界，報相重重無有障礙。	如《華嚴經》即不然，教主則是毘盧遮那為教主故，即是法報理智真身，具無量相海功德之所莊嚴，三世諸佛同為一際一時法界，報相重重無有障礙。	001	The Avatamsaka Sutra is not like this. The teacher is Vairocana. Because he is the teacher, he is the Dharma-body, the true body of wisdom and principle, adorned with the ocean of immeasurable characteristics and merits.

Within a single particle of dust, self and other share the same essence. It is not the same as the assembly of the Lotus Sutra, where humans and gods are moved to reveal the pure lands. This is established for those with provisional faculties who are stuck in the view of self and other.

['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725c08_10']	佛表果法，舉果為因，大悲行成根本智，果體自成，故無言不說也。	佛表果法，舉果為因，大悲行成根本智，果體自成，故無言不說也。	001	The Buddha represents the Dharma of fruition. Taking fruition as the cause, great compassion practice forms fundamental wisdom. The essence of fruition is naturally accomplished, so there is no speech or non-speaking.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725c10_4']	以大悲行從無作根本智起故，文殊普賢表因位可說，說佛果法示悟眾生。	以大悲行從無作根本智起故，文殊普賢表因位可說，說佛果法示悟眾生。	001	Because great compassion practice arises from fundamental wisdom without contrivance, Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra represent the causal stage that can be spoken of, speaking the Buddha's fruition Dharma to reveal and awaken sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725c12_7']	〈阿僧祇品〉世間數法廣大難量，唯佛究竟，不屬五位中因果門故，是佛自位內法門，還佛自說。	〈阿僧祇品〉世間數法廣大難量，唯佛究竟，不屬五位中因果門故，是佛自位內法門，還佛自說。	001	The Asṃkhyeya Chapters extensively discuss the worldly numerical principles, which are vast and difficult to measure. Only the Buddha has fully realized them. They do not belong to the causal and resultant teachings within the five stages. They are the Dharma gates within the Buddha's own stage, and so the Buddha himself speaks of them.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725c15_4']	〈隨好光明功德品〉則是如來自成因果，後佛自說法爾之力，恒常福智光明之法門，示為不屬五位之內行相因果，故佛亦自說。	〈隨好光明功德品〉則是如來自成因果，後佛自說法爾之力，恒常福智光明之法門，示為不屬五位之內行相因果，故佛亦自說。	001	The Chapter on the Meritorious Virtues of the Light of the Auspicious Marks is the fruition that the Tathāgata himself has accomplished. Later, the Buddha himself speaks of the power of the Dharma as it is, the Dharma gate of the light of merit and wisdom that is always present, demonstrating that it does not belong to the causal and resultant characteristics within the five stages. Therefore, the Buddha also speaks of it himself.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725c15_13']	此明佛果無二愚也。	此明佛果無二愚也。	001	This clarifies that the Buddha's fruition has no two kinds of ignorance.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725c18_13']	除此二品經外，諸餘三十八品，皆是五位之內行相法門，是故佛不自說，總令十信、十住、十行等當位之內菩薩自說，佛但放光表之。	除此二品經外，諸餘三十八品，皆是五位之內行相法門，是故佛不自說，總令十信、十住、十行等當位之內菩薩自說，佛但放光表之。	001	Apart from these two chapters, the remaining thirty-eight chapters are all the methods of practice within the five stages. Therefore, the Buddha did not speak them himself, but ordered the bodhisattvas in each stage, such as the ten faiths, ten abodes, and ten practices, to speak them. The Buddha only emitted light to symbolize them.

They were all great bodhisattvas in the stage of Buddhahood, who asked each other questions and established the methods of practice for the stage of Buddhahood, in order to enlighten those with great capacity. They directly took the Buddha's fruition as the cause.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0725c23_10']	因即以果為因、果即以因為果，如種種子等。	因即以果為因、果即以因為果，如種種子等。	001	The cause is the fruition as the cause, and the fruition is the cause as the fruition, like various seeds.

According to the Lotus Sutra, it causes the trichiliocosm to be pure and adorned, and the transformed multitudes are all filled with it. The Buddhas who come all say they are transformations.

There are ten locations and ten assemblies, all filling the ten directions without moving from their original places, yet pervading the Dharma realm. Each body's appearance and pores, countries and lands, layer upon layer, the bodies of bodhisattvas and Buddhas interpenetrate each other, and the various kinds of sentient beings are also all unobstructed. The bodies and lands interpenetrate like reflections containing each other.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0726a03_11']	所來之眾不壞法身而隨相好，法身相好一際無差，即相全真無有化也。	所來之眾不壞法身而隨相好，法身相好一際無差，即相全真無有化也。	001	The multitudes that come do not destroy the Dharma body while following the major and minor marks. The Dharma body and the major and minor marks are of one continuum, without distinction. The marks are entirely true, without any transformation.
['ZH_T36_1739_001:0726a04_14']	不同餘教說化說真有相參會，是故今言大會別也。	不同餘教說化說真有相參會，是故今言大會別也。	001	It is different from other teachings that speak of transformation and speak of truth, with a mixture of characteristics. Therefore, now it is said that the great assemblies are different.
