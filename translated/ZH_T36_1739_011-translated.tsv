['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787a18_8']	如資糧位，准三乘說，十信、十住、十行、十向為道前四種資糧；	如資糧位，准三乘說，十信、十住、十行、十向為道前四種資糧；	In the stage of provisions, according to the three vehicles, the ten faiths, ten abodes, ten practices, and ten dedications are the four kinds of provisions before the path;

For bodhisattvas below the grounds of the three vehicles, they spend one great eon cultivating conditioned and contaminated practices.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787a21_12']	初地見道，如此經十信之中全信自心與十方諸佛性相大智無差別體。	初地見道，如此經十信之中全信自心與十方諸佛性相大智無差別體。	The path of seeing on the first ground is like the complete faith in one's own mind being no different from the essence and characteristics of the great wisdom of the buddhas of the ten directions within the ten faiths of this sutra.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787a22_8']	十住初心以修方便三昧力見道。	十住初心以修方便三昧力見道。	The beginner of the ten abodes sees the path through the power of cultivating the samādhi of skillful means.

Being equal to the Buddha's fruition, they are nourished by the practices and functions of Samantabhadra. The fruition of the Dharma body, wisdom, and nature seen by the beginner of the ten abodes is nourished by the practices of Samantabhadra. It does not belong to the conditioned and impermanent of humans and gods.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787a29_5']	從初發心住，五位進修如來法身理智性果、普賢行果，於一真法界之中互為資糧。	從初發心住，五位進修如來法身理智性果、普賢行果，於一真法界之中互為資糧。	From the abode of initial generation of the mind, the five stages progress and cultivate the fruition of the Dharma body, wisdom, and nature of the Tathāgata, and the fruition of the practices of Samantabhadra, mutually nourishing each other within the one true Dharma realm.

['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b02_4']	是故以佛理智之果嚴行、以行嚴果，故為佛華嚴也。	是故以佛理智之果嚴行、以行嚴果，故為佛華嚴也。	Therefore, the fruition of the Buddha's wisdom is used to adorn the practices, and the practices are used to adorn the fruition. Thus, it is called the Adornment of the Buddha's Flower.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b04_7']	是故以下十住、十行、十迴向位中，皆得十方諸佛與入位菩薩同號，及與智、摩頂，會同體智也。	是故以下十住、十行、十迴向位中，皆得十方諸佛與入位菩薩同號，及與智、摩頂，會同體智也。	Therefore, in the stages of the ten abodes, ten practices, and ten dedications, all are given the same name as the Buddhas of the ten directions and the bodhisattvas who have entered the stages, and are touched on the head by wisdom, unifying with the wisdom of the same essence.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b05_11']	如三乘菩薩，多生他方淨土，及四禪向上別有菩薩淨土。	如三乘菩薩，多生他方淨土，及四禪向上別有菩薩淨土。	Like the bodhisattvas of the three vehicles, they are mostly born in the pure lands of other directions, and above the fourth dhyana heaven there are separate pure lands for bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b06_9']	設在欲界，即言以悲願力故留惑潤生。	設在欲界，即言以悲願力故留惑潤生。	Even if they are in the desire realm, it is said that they remain in the world out of the power of compassion and vows, moistening their births with afflictions.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b09_19']	非如此經法門，乘如來法界乘，從初發心住，以如來大智法身性果、普賢行果普周生死，動寂均平、理事普進，以法界體用以治餘習，法無前却、故新等報。	非如此經法門，乘如來法界乘，從初發心住，以如來大智法身性果、普賢行果普周生死，動寂均平、理事普進，以法界體用以治餘習，法無前却、故新等報。	This is not like the Dharma gates of this sutra, which ride the vehicle of the Tathagata's Dharma realm. From the first stage of generating the mind of enlightenment, with the nature fruition of the Tathagata's great wisdom Dharma body, the fruition of Samantabhadra's practice pervades birth and death, and with the function of the essence of the Dharma realm, treats the remaining habits. The Dharma has no front or back, and the new and old retributions are equal.

['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b12_18']	五位既無佛果，明知十地見道未真。	五位既無佛果，明知十地見道未真。	Since there is no Buddha fruit in the five stages, it is clear that the path of seeing in the ten grounds is not true.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b16_4']	如此經於十信心中，自信自心有十種世界，即如金色世界、妙色世界、蓮華色世界，如是有十箇色世界，為十信心是有為故，所信佛境界是色也。	如此經於十信心中，自信自心有十種世界，即如金色世界、妙色世界、蓮華色世界，如是有十箇色世界，為十信心是有為故，所信佛境界是色也。	In this sutra, within the ten faiths, one has confidence in one's own mind and has ten kinds of worlds, such as the golden-colored world, the wondrous-colored world, and the lotus-colored world. There are ten such colored worlds because the ten faiths are conditioned, and the Buddha realm one has faith in is form.

['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b23_9']	除此十信位中以生滅心信十色世界、十智如來，至十住、十行、十迴向、十地、等覺十一地，總有五十箇因果，皆以普賢行為因、以如來法身理智性為果，或更互參之以相資發。	除此十信位中以生滅心信十色世界、十智如來，至十住、十行、十迴向、十地、等覺十一地，總有五十箇因果，皆以普賢行為因、以如來法身理智性為果，或更互參之以相資發。	Except for these ten stages of faith, in which one uses the mind of arising and ceasing to believe in the ten worlds of form and the ten wisdom buddhas, up to the ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and the eleventh ground of equal enlightenment, there are a total of fifty causes and effects, all using Samantabhadra's practices as the cause and the Tathāgata's Dharma body, wisdom, and nature as the effect, or else interpenetrating each other to mutually assist and inspire.

Taking the five layers of causes and five layers of effects in each of the five stages together, there are a total of one hundred and ten layers of causes and effects.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b28_4']	如十住位中佛因果者，即因陀羅花世界、波頭摩花世界、寶花世界，佛號殊特月佛、無盡月佛，不動月佛。	如十住位中佛因果者，即因陀羅花世界、波頭摩花世界、寶花世界，佛號殊特月佛、無盡月佛，不動月佛。	As for the buddha causes and effects in the stage of the ten abodes, they are the Indra flower world, the padma flower world, and the treasure flower world, with the buddhas called the extraordinary moon buddha, the inexhaustible moon buddha, and the immovable moon buddha.
['ZH_T36_1739_011:0787b29_3']	如是十花世界、十箇同號月佛以為佛果。	如是十花世界、十箇同號月佛以為佛果。	Thus, the ten flower worlds and the ten buddhas with the same name of moon are taken as the buddha effect.
