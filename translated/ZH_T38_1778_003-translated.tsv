For those who do not yet understand, it is necessary for the superior bodhisattvas to open and inspire them.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0596b24_18']	今淨名住不思議解脫之權謀，故能輔佛折伏攝受有機之徒，令離諸緣集成不思議解脫，若淨土行熟則隨業來生，各於其土聞法調伏、入慧起根。	今淨名住不思議解脫之權謀，故能輔佛折伏攝受有機之徒，令離諸緣集成不思議解脫，若淨土行熟則隨業來生，各於其土聞法調伏、入慧起根。	Now, Vimalakīrti abides in the expedient wisdom of inconceivable liberation, thus he is able to assist the Buddha in subduing and accepting those with karmic affinity, causing them to leave all conditions and perfect inconceivable liberation. If the practice of the Pure Land is mature, one will be reborn according to one's karma, and in each land one will hear the Dharma, be tamed, enter wisdom, and develop faculties.

['ZH_T38_1778_003:0596c03_8']	一、略釋名者，「方」是智所詣之偏法、「便」是善權巧用之能巧，用諸法隨機利物，故云方便。	一、略釋名者，「方」是智所詣之偏法、「便」是善權巧用之能巧，用諸法隨機利物，故云方便。	First, briefly explaining the name: fang is the biased Dharma that wisdom reaches, and bian is the skillful ability of skillful means. Skillfully using various dharmas to benefit beings according to their capacities, it is called skillful means.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0596c04_3']	故文云「智度菩薩母，方便善權父。	故文云「智度菩薩母，方便善權父。	Therefore, the text says: Prajñā is the mother of bodhisattvas, and skillful means is the father.

['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a07_9']	圓空門者，不斷煩惱照界內外事理之有名為權智，照事理皆空名為實智。	圓空門者，不斷煩惱照界內外事理之有名為權智，照事理皆空名為實智。	In the perfect teaching of emptiness, not cutting off afflictions and illuminating the name of phenomena and principles within and outside the realms is called the wisdom of provisionality, while illuminating the emptiness of phenomena and principles is called the wisdom of reality.

['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a20_7']	今約此經，遠論室外折伏即是破他執法之方便；	今約此經，遠論室外折伏即是破他執法之方便；	Now, discussing this sutra from a distance, the refutation outside the room is precisely the expedient means of refuting others' attachment to the Dharma;
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a21_3']	室內攝受即是引他立法之方便；	室內攝受即是引他立法之方便；	The acceptance inside the room is precisely the expedient means of attracting others to establish the Dharma;
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a22_6']	以折伏攝受令法久住，前二亦是化眾生之方便也。	以折伏攝受令法久住，前二亦是化眾生之方便也。	Using refutation and acceptance to make the Dharma endure for a long time, the first two are also expedient means for transforming sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a24_10']	若約此經近論者，此品呵諸人者即是破法折伏，勸求佛身即是立法攝受，以折攝故令法久住。	若約此經近論者，此品呵諸人者即是破法折伏，勸求佛身即是立法攝受，以折攝故令法久住。	If discussing this sutra from a near perspective, the reprimanding of the people in this chapter is precisely the refutation of the Dharma, encouraging the pursuit of the Buddha's body is precisely the acceptance of establishing the Dharma, and using refutation and acceptance causes the Dharma to endure for a long time.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a25_10']	法得久住者，謂令眾生入真性解脫清淨佛土。	法得久住者，謂令眾生入真性解脫清淨佛土。	The Dharma being able to endure for a long time means causing sentient beings to enter the true nature, liberation, and the pure Buddha land.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a27_5']	是以《中論》品品明破即是破法，後〈四諦品〉明三寶四諦四沙門果即是立法。	是以《中論》品品明破即是破法，後〈四諦品〉明三寶四諦四沙門果即是立法。	Therefore, in the Madhyamaka-śāstra, each chapter's elucidation of refutation is precisely the refutation of the Dharma, and the chapter on the Four Noble Truths elucidates the Three Jewels, the Four Noble Truths, and the Four Fruits of the Ascetic Life, which is precisely the establishment of the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597a28_20']	又偈結云「因緣所生法，我說即是空」，破法折伏也，亦名為假名立法攝受也。	又偈結云「因緣所生法，我說即是空」，破法折伏也，亦名為假名立法攝受也。	The verse concludes by saying The dharmas produced by causes and conditions, I say are precisely emptiness, which refutes dharmas and subdues them, and is also called provisionally establishing dharmas to embrace them.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597b02_15']	「亦是中道義」，教化眾生令法得久住，法久住者令見佛性住大涅槃，故前品云「隨其方便能成就眾生，隨成就眾生即佛土淨。	「亦是中道義」，教化眾生令法得久住，法久住者令見佛性住大涅槃，故前品云「隨其方便能成就眾生，隨成就眾生即佛土淨。	It is also the meaning of the Middle Way, teaching and transforming sentient beings to enable the Dharma to endure for a long time. The Dharma enduring for a long time enables one to see the Buddha-nature and abide in great nirvāṇa. Therefore, the previous chapter says, In accordance with the skillful means, one is able to accomplish sentient beings. In accordance with accomplishing sentient beings, the Buddha-land is purified.

In order to transform sentient beings, with the vows of compassion and empathy, one responds to the ten Dharma realms with spiritual powers and sympathetic resonance, manifesting the inconceivable various bodily karmas in the ten directions to benefit beings. This is the skillful means of the secret of the body that is manifested.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597b10_2']	又以悲誓神通應化，現同十界所有音聲，十方佛土示不可說種種之法，是為口密方便利益。	又以悲誓神通應化，現同十界所有音聲，十方佛土示不可說種種之法，是為口密方便利益。	Furthermore, through the power of compassion, vows, spiritual powers, and transformation, he manifests sounds belonging to the ten realms, and in the buddha lands of the ten directions, he demonstrates various teachings beyond description. This is the secret of the mouth, which benefits through skillful means.
['ZH_T38_1778_003:0597b12_1']	又以悲誓神通應化現十界心，十方佛土現不可說心識種種分別，即是心密方便利益。	又以悲誓神通應化現十界心，十方佛土現不可說心識種種分別，即是心密方便利益。	Furthermore, through the power of compassion, vows, spiritual powers, and transformation, he manifests the minds of the ten realms, and in the buddha lands of the ten directions, he manifests the various discriminations of the mind and consciousness beyond description. This is the secret of the mind, which benefits through skillful means.

The Distinct and Perfect teachings manifest the three karmas of the Dharma body, which are also called the spiritual powers and transformations of the three karmas. Therefore, the three karmas are used to clarify skillful means.

For laypeople and others, it shows various bodies, which is the expedient means of body-secrecy. All see and respect it, and the illness arises to expound various teachings, which is the expedient means of speech-secrecy. These three karmic expedient means have no fixed way of benefiting beings, and one cannot fathom their basis. This is precisely the three secrets, also called the three inconceivable transformations of the wheel, the three non-losses, the three non-protections, and the three karmas following the practice of wisdom.

This means that the sixty-two views such as existence and non-existence, and all views and knowledge, are impermanent, and one can then see the principle and sever the delusions of views.
