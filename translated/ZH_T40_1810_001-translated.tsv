The other teachings are like the various jewels in the ocean. The Vinaya is the foundation of the Dharma, and the other teachings are the branches. The Vinaya is like the root of a tree, and the other teachings are like the leaves and flowers. The Vinaya is like the body of a person, and the other teachings are like the head and limbs.
