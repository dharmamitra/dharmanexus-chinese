['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a05_4']	第一、明造論意者，尋夫三界有情，五趣漂溺，循環不息，輪迴無替者，莫不以斷常空有紛糺于懷，所以菩薩降生垂範利物，為除空有兩執，故開空有二門，前明百法有體，為遣執空，後明人法二空，為除有見。	第一、明造論意者，尋夫三界有情，五趣漂溺，循環不息，輪迴無替者，莫不以斷常空有紛糺于懷，所以菩薩降生垂範利物，為除空有兩執，故開空有二門，前明百法有體，為遣執空，後明人法二空，為除有見。	001	First, as for clarifying the purpose of composing the treatise, seeking the sentient beings of the three realms, drifting in the five destinies, cycling without rest, and revolving without replacement, none of them do not confuse the mind with annihilationism, eternalism, emptiness, and existence. Therefore, the Bodhisattva descended to be born, manifested the teachings to benefit beings, and removed the two attachments to emptiness and existence. Therefore, he opened the two gates of emptiness and existence. The previous explanation of the hundred dharmas with substance is to dispel the attachment to emptiness, and the later explanation of the two kinds of emptiness of person and dharmas is to remove the view of existence.
['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a06_3']	所以有體，世諦非無，所以言空，真諦何有？	所以有體，世諦非無，所以言空，真諦何有？	001	The reason for having substance is that conventional truth is not non-existent, and the reason for speaking of emptiness is that ultimate truth has no existence.
['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a08_1']	隨病說藥，病息藥亡，執藥成病，悟病成藥，非空非有，即有即空，既絕百非，又亡四句。	隨病說藥，病息藥亡，執藥成病，悟病成藥，非空非有，即有即空，既絕百非，又亡四句。	001	The medicine is prescribed according to the illness. When the illness is cured, the medicine is discarded. Grasping the medicine becomes an illness. Realizing the illness becomes the medicine. Neither empty nor existent, both existent and empty. Having severed the hundred negations, one also abandons the four propositions.
['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a09_14']	然因詮顯旨，故假論以明，既不說而說，亦聽無所聽，論之興也，其在茲乎！	然因詮顯旨，故假論以明，既不說而說，亦聽無所聽，論之興也，其在茲乎！	001	However, because the meaning is revealed through interpretation, one relies on discussion to clarify it. Although it is spoken without being spoken, it is also listened to without being listened to. The purpose of the discussion lies in this!
['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a10_3']	此即第一明造論意。	此即第一明造論意。	001	This is the first point, clarifying the intention of composing the treatise.

The treatise says The Treatise on the Hundred Dharmas of the Mahāyāna, Briefly Extracting the Names and Numbers from the Main Section, Great is used to exclude the small and obtain the name. Vehicle means to transport and carry.
['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a12_18']	此言大乘，遮詮立號，非是直詮。	此言大乘，遮詮立號，非是直詮。	001	This phrase Mahāyāna excludes the interpretation and establishes the name, it is not a direct interpretation.
['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a13_12']	言遮詮者，簡小乘故，名曰遮詮。	言遮詮者，簡小乘故，名曰遮詮。	001	As for excluding the interpretation, it is called excluding the interpretation because it distinguishes the Hīnayāna.

['ZH_T44_1837_001:0053a19_16']	目召諸法，稱之曰名，一十百千名之為數，故言《大乘百法明門論．本事分》中略錄名數。	目召諸法，稱之曰名，一十百千名之為數，故言《大乘百法明門論．本事分》中略錄名數。	001	The eyes call the various dharmas names, and one, ten, one hundred, one thousand are called numbers, therefore it says briefly recording the names and numbers from the section on the main point in the Treatise on the Illumination of the Hundred Dharmas of the Great Vehicle.

It is the image manifested by those two dharmas, therefore the third one manifests form.

On top of the three dharmas of form, mind, and mental factors, they are established as existing through the distinction of states. Therefore the fourth one manifests the dharmas not associated with mind.
