Apart from food, there is no separate enjoyment of smell and taste. Touch has a separate function of supporting the faculties, clothing, and so forth.

Therefore, these three are born in the dhyānas and still follow each other. Odor and taste are not like this, and therefore they do not exist there.

['ZH_T29_1558_002:0007c15_3']	鼻舌依處彼有用故，離根應有。	鼻舌依處彼有用故，離根應有。	The base of the nose and tongue is useful there, and therefore the organs must exist there, even apart from their objects.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0007c16_4']	有雖無用而有根生，如處胞胎定當死者。	有雖無用而有根生，如處胞胎定當死者。	Even though there is no use, the organs are born, just as in the womb of one who is to die.

Sexual desire and the contact of sexual desire do not exist there, and therefore the male organ does not exist there. Therefore, in the realm of form, only fourteen kinds of elements are established.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0008a02_6']	無色界繫唯有後三，所謂意、法及意識界，要離色欲於彼得生，故無色中無十色界。	無色界繫唯有後三，所謂意、法及意識界，要離色欲於彼得生，故無色中無十色界。	The realm of desire has only the last three, namely, the mind, dharmas, and the mind consciousness element. One must be free from desire for form in order to be born there. Therefore, the ten elements of form do not exist in the formless realm.

['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c19_7']	如是生二三四靜慮，以自他地眼見自他地色，如理應思。	如是生二三四靜慮，以自他地眼見自他地色，如理應思。	In the same way, if one is born in the second, third, or fourth meditations and uses the eye of one's own stage or another stage to see form of one's own stage or another stage, one should consider it accordingly.

['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c21_0']	眼不下於身，　　色識非上眼，	眼不下於身，　　色識非上眼，	The eye is not lower than the body, and form and consciousness are not higher than the eye.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c22_13']	色於識一切，　　二於身亦然。	色於識一切，　　二於身亦然。	Form is in all consciousnesses, and the two are the same in relation to the body.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c23_0']	如眼耳亦然，　　次三皆自地，	如眼耳亦然，　　次三皆自地，	The ear is also like this. The next three are all of their own stage.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c24_13']	身識自下地，　　意不定應知。	身識自下地，　　意不定應知。	Body consciousness is of its own stage or a lower stage. Mental consciousness should be known as indefinite.

['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c26_10']	身眼色三皆通五地，謂在欲界四靜慮中，眼識唯在欲界初定。	身眼色三皆通五地，謂在欲界四靜慮中，眼識唯在欲界初定。	The body, eye, and form belong to five stages, namely the desire realm and the four meditations. Eye consciousness belongs only to the desire realm and the first meditation.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c27_8']	此中眼根望身生地，或等或上終不居下。	此中眼根望身生地，或等或上終不居下。	In this context, the eye faculty is either equal to or higher than the body’s stage of rebirth, and never lower.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0012c29_1']	色識望眼等下非上，下眼不能見上色故、上識不依下地眼故。	色識望眼等下非上，下眼不能見上色故、上識不依下地眼故。	Form and consciousness are either equal to or lower than the eye, but not higher. This is because the lower eye cannot see higher form, and higher consciousness does not depend on a lower eye.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a01_1']	色望於識通等上下，色識於身如色於識。	色望於識通等上下，色識於身如色於識。	Form is either equal to, higher than, or lower than consciousness. Form and consciousness are related to the body in the same way that form is related to consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a02_11']	廣說耳界應知如眼，謂耳不下於身，聲識非上耳，聲於識一切。	廣說耳界應知如眼，謂耳不下於身，聲識非上耳，聲於識一切。	It should be understood that the extensive explanation of the ear faculty is the same as that of the eye. That is, the ear is not lower than the body, sound and ear consciousness are not higher than the ear, and sound is related to consciousness in all ways.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a03_7']	二於身亦然，隨其所應廣如眼釋。	二於身亦然，隨其所應廣如眼釋。	The two are also related to the body in the same way, as extensively explained according to the circumstances in the discussion of the eye.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a04_12']	鼻舌身三總皆自地，於中別者，謂身與觸其地必同。	鼻舌身三總皆自地，於中別者，謂身與觸其地必同。	The nose, tongue, and body faculties are all in the same stage as the body. There are differences among them, however. That is, the body and tangibles are in the same stage.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a06_3']	識望觸身或自或下，自謂若生欲界初定，生上三定謂之為下。	識望觸身或自或下，自謂若生欲界初定，生上三定謂之為下。	Consciousness is either in the same stage as the body or in a lower stage. The same stage means that if one is born in the desire realm or the first meditation, the higher three meditations are called lower.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a07_12']	應知意界四事不定，謂意有時與身識法四皆同地，有時上下。	應知意界四事不定，謂意有時與身識法四皆同地，有時上下。	You should know that the mental faculty is not fixed in the four matters. Sometimes the mental faculty is in the same stage as the body, consciousness, and dharmas, and sometimes it is above or below.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a08_3']	身唯五地，三通一切。	身唯五地，三通一切。	The body is only in five stages, and the three are all-pervasive.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a09_13']	於遊等至及受生時，隨其所應或同或異，如後定品當廣分別。	於遊等至及受生時，隨其所應或同或異，如後定品當廣分別。	When wandering in samādhis and receiving birth, according to what is appropriate, sometimes they are the same and sometimes different. This will be extensively distinguished later in the chapter on samādhi.

['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a13_0']	五外二所識，　　常法界無為，	五外二所識，　　常法界無為，	The five external [realms] are cognized by two [consciousnesses], the permanent dharmadhātu is unconditioned,
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a14_13']	法一分是根，　　并內界十二。	法一分是根，　　并內界十二。	One part of the dharmas is a faculty, along with the twelve internal realms.

['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a16_14']	十八界中色等五界，如其次第眼等五識各一所識，又總皆是意識所識。	十八界中色等五界，如其次第眼等五識各一所識，又總皆是意識所識。	Among the eighteen elements, the five elements of form, etc., are respectively cognized by the five consciousnesses beginning with eye consciousness, and are also generally cognized by mental consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a17_8']	如是五界各六識中二識所識。	如是五界各六識中二識所識。	Thus these five elements are cognized by two of the six consciousnesses.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a18_16']	由此准知，餘十三界一切唯是意識所識，非五識身所緣境故。	由此准知，餘十三界一切唯是意識所識，非五識身所緣境故。	By this same principle, the remaining thirteen elements are cognized only by mental consciousness, because they are not objects of the five consciousnesses such as eye consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a20_10']	十八界中無有一界全是常者，唯法一分無為是常，義准無常法餘餘界。	十八界中無有一界全是常者，唯法一分無為是常，義准無常法餘餘界。	There is not a single element that is entirely permanent, but a part of the element of dharmas, namely unconditioned dharmas, is permanent. By implication, the remaining elements are impermanent.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a23_18']	又經中說二十二根，謂眼根、耳根、鼻根、舌根、身根、意根、女根、男根、命根、樂根、苦根、喜根、憂根、捨根、信根、勤根、念根、定根、慧根、未知當知根、已知根、具知根。	又經中說二十二根，謂眼根、耳根、鼻根、舌根、身根、意根、女根、男根、命根、樂根、苦根、喜根、憂根、捨根、信根、勤根、念根、定根、慧根、未知當知根、已知根、具知根。	A scripture speaks of twenty-two faculties, i.e., the faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, the female and male faculties, the vitality faculty, the faculties of pleasure, pain, gladness, and sorrow, the faculty of indifference, the faculties of faith, devotion, memory, concentration, and discernment, the faculty of knowing the unknown, the faculty of the state of having learned, and the faculty of having fully known.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a25_9']	阿毘達磨諸大論師，皆越經中六處次第，於命根後方說意根，有所緣故。	阿毘達磨諸大論師，皆越經中六處次第，於命根後方說意根，有所緣故。	The great abhidharma masters all go beyond the order of the six sense bases in the sutras and explain the mental faculty after life faculty, because it has objects.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a26_12']	如是所說二十二根，十八界中內十二界法一分攝。	如是所說二十二根，十八界中內十二界法一分攝。	Among the eighteen elements, the twenty-two faculties are included in the one part of the twelve internal elements.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013a27_13']	法一分者，命等十一、後三一分，法界攝故。	法一分者，命等十一、後三一分，法界攝故。	The one part of the dharmas refers to the eleven faculties such as life, and the latter three faculties partially. They are included in the dharma element.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013b01_1']	內十二者，眼等五根如自名攝，意根通是七心界攝，後三一分意意識攝，女根、男根即是身界一分所攝。	內十二者，眼等五根如自名攝，意根通是七心界攝，後三一分意意識攝，女根、男根即是身界一分所攝。	The twelve internal ones refer to the five faculties such as the eyes, which are included in their own names. The mental faculty is generally included in the seven consciousness elements. The latter three faculties partially are included in the mental faculty, mental consciousness, and manas. The female faculty and male faculty are included in a part of the body element.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013b01_6']	如後當辯。	如後當辯。	This will be explained later.
['ZH_T29_1558_002:0013b02_5']	義准所餘，色等五界法界一分皆體非根。	義准所餘，色等五界法界一分皆體非根。	By implication, the remaining five elements such as form, and a part of the dharma element, are all not faculties by nature.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
