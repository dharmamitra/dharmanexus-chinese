Nature refers to the originally existent and unchanging, which is the principle of the inherent three thousand. Now, it shows that the whole nature gives rise to cultivation, so all practices are without action. The whole cultivation is in the nature, so a single thought is perfectly accomplished. This means that there is no nature outside of cultivation, and no cultivation outside of nature. They mutually negate and mutually include, so it is called non-duality, and the wonderful dharma of the mind is taken as the gate.

['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a16_18']	初、直明性德。	初、直明性德。	First, directly clarifying the nature-derived virtues.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a17_12']	言德者即本具三千，皆常樂我淨故。	言德者即本具三千，皆常樂我淨故。	The term virtue refers to the originally inherent three thousand, all of which are of permanence, bliss, self, and purity.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a18_8']	界如一念，即前內境具德剎那心也。	界如一念，即前內境具德剎那心也。	The realm is like a single thought, which is the instant of mind endowed with virtues mentioned above.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a21_6']	界如既即空假中，任運成於三德三軌等，即空是般若清淨義故，即假是解脫自在義故，即中是法身究竟義故，諸三例之。	界如既即空假中，任運成於三德三軌等，即空是般若清淨義故，即假是解脫自在義故，即中是法身究竟義故，諸三例之。	Since the realm of reality is already empty, provisional, and middle, it naturally forms the three virtues, three tracks, etc. Emptiness is the meaning of the purity of prajñā, provisionality is the meaning of the freedom of liberation, and the middle is the ultimate meaning of the Dharma body. The other three are analogous.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a22_6']	然諸法皆可論於修性，亦為成觀唯指一念。	然諸法皆可論於修性，亦為成觀唯指一念。	However, all dharmas can be discussed in terms of cultivation and nature, and in order to accomplish the contemplation, only one thought is pointed to.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a24_2']	應知前二門直明依境立觀，此門及因果不二乃委示前二，令成圓行始終也。	應知前二門直明依境立觀，此門及因果不二乃委示前二，令成圓行始終也。	One should know that the previous two gates directly clarify the establishment of contemplation based on the object, while this gate and the non-duality of cause and effect thoroughly demonstrate the previous two, enabling the perfect practice to begin and end.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a24_5']	何者？	何者？	What is that?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a25_3']	性德豈出色心不二，修德莫非一心三觀。	性德豈出色心不二，修德莫非一心三觀。	How can the nature virtues not be non-dual with form and mind? The cultivation virtues are nothing other than the one mind and three contemplations.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a27_8']	今示修性互成成妙智行，以此智行從因至果，則位位無作，方名如夢勤加等，即自行始終皆妙也。	今示修性互成成妙智行，以此智行從因至果，則位位無作，方名如夢勤加等，即自行始終皆妙也。	Now, it is shown that cultivation and nature mutually accomplish the wondrous wisdom practice. With this wisdom practice, from cause to effect, each stage is without action, and is then called diligent practice in a dream, which is the wondrous beginning and end of one's own practice.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713a28_1']	二、性雖下，以修對辨二：	二、性雖下，以修對辨二：	Second, although the nature is... using cultivation to distinguish two:
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b01_9']	初、相成者，性雖具足全體在迷，必藉妙智解了發起圓修，故云性雖本爾藉智起修，由此智行方能徹照性德。	初、相成者，性雖具足全體在迷，必藉妙智解了發起圓修，故云性雖本爾藉智起修，由此智行方能徹照性德。	First, as for the mutual accomplishment, although the nature is complete and the entire essence is in delusion, it must rely on wondrous wisdom to understand and give rise to perfect cultivation. Therefore, it is said that although the nature is originally so, it relies on wisdom to give rise to cultivation. Because of this wisdom and practice, one is then able to thoroughly illuminate the nature's virtues.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b04_5']	而此智行復由性德全體而發，若非性發不能照性，若非徹照性無由顯，故云由修照性、由性發修，此二句正辨相成之相。	而此智行復由性德全體而發，若非性發不能照性，若非徹照性無由顯，故云由修照性、由性發修，此二句正辨相成之相。	And this wisdom and practice are also given rise to by the entire essence of the nature's virtues. If it were not given rise to by the nature, it would not be able to illuminate the nature. If it were not for thorough illumination, the nature would have no way to manifest. Therefore, it is said that cultivation illuminates the nature and the nature gives rise to cultivation. These two sentences precisely discern the aspect of mutual accomplishment.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b06_10']	二、在性下，明互具者，相成之義雖顯，恐謂修從顯發方有、性德稍異修成，故今全指修成本來已具。	二、在性下，明互具者，相成之義雖顯，恐謂修從顯發方有、性德稍異修成，故今全指修成本來已具。	Second, as for the mutual inclusion below in the nature, although the meaning of mutual accomplishment is already evident, it is feared that one would think that cultivation only exists when it is manifested and that the nature's virtues are slightly different from cultivated accomplishments. Therefore, it is now completely pointed out that cultivation is originally already included.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b08_3']	如《止觀》廣辨三千之相，雖是逆順二修，全為顯於性具，則全修成性也。	如《止觀》廣辨三千之相，雖是逆順二修，全為顯於性具，則全修成性也。	As the Mohe Zhiguan extensively discerns the characteristics of the three thousand, although they are the two cultivations of going against and going along, they are entirely for revealing what is already included in the nature. Then, the entire cultivation becomes the nature.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b09_15', 'ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b11_4']	又一一行業因果自他，雖假修成，全是性德三千顯現，故云全性成修也。🔽又雖全性起修，而未嘗少虧性德，以常不改故，故云性無所移。	又一一行業因果自他，雖假修成，全是性德三千顯現，故云全性成修也。 又雖全性起修，而未嘗少虧性德，以常不改故，故云性無所移。	Moreover, each and every karmic cause and effect, although provisionally cultivated and accomplished, is entirely the manifestation of the inherent virtues of the three thousand. Therefore, it is said that the nature is entirely cultivated.🔽Moreover, although the nature is entirely aroused in cultivation, it is never diminished in inherent virtues, because it is always unchanging. Therefore, it is said that the nature does not move.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b12_11']	雖全修成性，而未始暫闕修德，以常變造故，故云修常宛爾。	雖全修成性，而未始暫闕修德，以常變造故，故云修常宛爾。	Although the cultivation is entirely accomplished in the nature, it is never temporarily lacking in cultivated virtues, because it is always transforming and creating. Therefore, it is said that the cultivation is always distinct.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b14_6']	然若知修性各論三千，則諸義皆顯，故荊谿云，諸家不明修性，蓋不如此明也。	然若知修性各論三千，則諸義皆顯，故荊谿云，諸家不明修性，蓋不如此明也。	If one understands that the three thousand are discussed in both cultivation and nature, then all the meanings are revealed. Therefore, Jingxi says, The various families do not clarify cultivation and nature, but it is not like this.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b14_8']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b15_9']	「他云，舊本作藉知曰修，而以本性靈知用釋知字。	「他云，舊本作藉知曰修，而以本性靈知用釋知字。	Others say that the old version uses 'borrowing knowledge' for cultivation, and explains the character 'knowledge' with the spiritual knowledge of inherent nature.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b17_15']	若云藉智起修者，蓋寫者書曰逼知，後人認作智字，既不成句，又見下句有起修之言，遂輒加起字爾。	若云藉智起修者，蓋寫者書曰逼知，後人認作智字，既不成句，又見下句有起修之言，遂輒加起字爾。	If it is said that borrowing knowledge arouses cultivation, it seems that the writer wrote 'approaching knowledge', and later people recognized it as the character 'knowledge'. Since it does not form a sentence, and seeing that the next sentence has the words 'arousing cultivation', they simply added the character 'arousing'.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b18_1']	此復云何？	此復云何？	What is this again?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b18_4']	」答：	」答：	The answer:
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b19_12']	「既許寫曰逼知，遂成智之一字，何妨往人寫日遠知，誤成知曰二字。	「既許寫曰逼知，遂成智之一字，何妨往人寫日遠知，誤成知曰二字。	Since it is allowed to write 'approaching knowledge,' it becomes the single word 'wisdom.' Why not allow the ancient person to write 'distant knowledge' as 'knowledge,' mistakenly forming the two characters?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b20_17']	必是因脫起字，復由二字相懸，致使有本作藉知曰修也。	必是因脫起字，復由二字相懸，致使有本作藉知曰修也。	This must be due to the omission of the character 'arise,' and also because the two characters are far apart, causing some editions to have 'rely on knowledge' instead of 'cultivate.'
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b22_11']	故知寫字添脫，遠近難可定之，魚魯之訛豈今獨有，須將義定方見是非。	故知寫字添脫，遠近難可定之，魚魯之訛豈今獨有，須將義定方見是非。	Therefore, it is known that the addition and omission of written characters are difficult to determine in the distant and recent [past]. How can the errors of 'fish' and 'lu' be unique to the present? It is necessary to determine the meaning in order to see what is right and wrong.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b22_14']	何者？	何者？	What is that?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b24_17']	他既暗於三法妙義，尚將一念因心陰識，直作真知解之，況今有此訛文知字可執，豈不作靈知解邪？	他既暗於三法妙義，尚將一念因心陰識，直作真知解之，況今有此訛文知字可執，豈不作靈知解邪？	Since others are already obscure about the wonderful meaning of the three natures, they still take the causal mind and shadowy consciousness as true knowledge. How much more so now that there is this erroneous character 'knowledge' to grasp, wouldn't it lead to the understanding of spiritual knowledge?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b27_6']	且靈知之名圭峯專用，既非即陰而示，又無修發之相，正是偏指清淨真如，唯於真心及緣理斷九之義也。	且靈知之名圭峯專用，既非即陰而示，又無修發之相，正是偏指清淨真如，唯於真心及緣理斷九之義也。	Moreover, the name 'spiritual knowledge' is exclusively used by Guifeng. Since it is not demonstrated as the aggregates, and also lacks the characteristics of cultivation and arousal, it is precisely the biased pointing to pure suchness, which is only about the meaning of the true mind and the severance of the nine [realms] through contemplating the principle [of emptiness].
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b28_17']	他云，因真教緣示善惡知，即是真知，乃知諸法唯心，故云藉知曰修。	他云，因真教緣示善惡知，即是真知，乃知諸法唯心，故云藉知曰修。	Another says, The true teaching is the condition that reveals the knowledge of good and evil, which is the true knowledge. It is the knowledge that all dharmas are only mind, so it is said that practice relies on knowledge.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b28_20']	今問：	今問：	I now ask:
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b29_9']	此之知字，為解為行？	此之知字，為解為行？	Is this character zhi (knowledge) understanding or practice?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713b29_18']	若隨闕者則不名修。	若隨闕者則不名修。	If either is lacking, it cannot be called practice.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c03_1']	若單立知字解行足者，乃玄文智行二妙，《止觀》妙解正修便為徒設，則天台但傳《禪詮都序》也。	若單立知字解行足者，乃玄文智行二妙，《止觀》妙解正修便為徒設，則天台但傳《禪詮都序》也。	If the character zhi alone is sufficient for both understanding and practice, then the two marvels of wisdom and practice in the Profound Text and the marvelous understanding and correct practice in the Mohezhiguan would be useless, and Tiantai would only transmit the preface to the Chan Canon.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c04_3']	又言示善惡知即真知者，還須先用妙解即之不？	又言示善惡知即真知者，還須先用妙解即之不？	Moreover, it is said that revealing the knowledge of good and evil is the true knowledge. Does it still need to first use marvelous understanding to realize it or not?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c04_11']	次用妙行即之不？	次用妙行即之不？	Next, does it need to use marvelous practice to realize it or not?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c05_2']	若然者，正是藉智起修。	若然者，正是藉智起修。	If so, it is precisely relying on wisdom to give rise to practice.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c05_16']	若不然者，智行二妙全無用也。	若不然者，智行二妙全無用也。	If not, then the two marvels of wisdom and practice are completely useless.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c07_18']	今云藉智起修，直是由於智妙起於行妙耳，故後結文云，如境本來具三，依理生解故名為智。	今云藉智起修，直是由於智妙起於行妙耳，故後結文云，如境本來具三，依理生解故名為智。	Now it is said that practice arises based on wisdom, which is simply due to the arising of the wonderful practice based on the wonderful wisdom. Therefore, the concluding text says, Just as the realm originally possesses the three, relying on principle to give rise to understanding is called wisdom.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c08_17']	智解導行，行解契理，三法相符不異而異。	智解導行，行解契理，三法相符不異而異。	Wisdom and understanding guide practice, and practice and understanding accord with principle. The three dharmas correspond without difference, yet there is difference.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c10_13']	然智行俱修今偏在行者，蓋智從解了發起義彊，行就進趣修治義彊，故從彊也。	然智行俱修今偏在行者，蓋智從解了發起義彊，行就進趣修治義彊，故從彊也。	However, both wisdom and practice are cultivated, but now it is biased towards practice. It is because the meaning of giving rise to wisdom arises from understanding, and the meaning of advancing and cultivating practice is strong, so it follows the strong.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c11_17']	又此一句，全是《釋籤》行妙中文，彼云藉智起行故。	又此一句，全是《釋籤》行妙中文，彼云藉智起行故。	Moreover, this single sentence is entirely the text of the wonderful practice in the Shiqian. It says, Because wisdom gives rise to practice.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c12_8']	他又云，智名未稱全性成修。	他又云，智名未稱全性成修。	Moreover, it says, The name wisdom does not fully accord with the nature becoming cultivation.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c12_16']	若爾，何名智妙？	若爾，何名智妙？	If so, what is called the wonderful wisdom?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c13_11']	應亦本是知妙，後人改為智妙乎！	應亦本是知妙，後人改為智妙乎！	Should it also originally be the wonderful knowledge, but later people changed it to the wonderful wisdom?

['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c14_14']	初、明對逆故二性並存。	初、明對逆故二性並存。	First, it clarifies that because of going against, the two natures are both present.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c15_4']	二、明因順故二心俱泯。	二、明因順故二心俱泯。	Second, clarifying that because of following the nature, both minds are extinguished.

Since the name of cultivation is common, there is that which is followed and that which is opposed. Now, in order to simultaneously extinguish both, it is first necessary to distinguish them.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c17_14']	了性為行者，即藉智起修也。	了性為行者，即藉智起修也。	Understanding the nature as practice is relying on wisdom to give rise to cultivation.

['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c19_6']	逆稱修者，即修惡之類也。	逆稱修者，即修惡之類也。	Opposed cultivation refers to the various types of cultivated evil.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c20_11']	心雖不二等者，隨緣迷了之處，心性不變，故云不二。	心雖不二等者，隨緣迷了之處，心性不變，故云不二。	Although the mind is not two, etc., in the place of following conditions and delusion, the nature of the mind is unchanging, therefore it is said to be not two.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c21_14']	逆順二性是全體隨緣，故即理之事常分，故曰事殊。	逆順二性是全體隨緣，故即理之事常分，故曰事殊。	The two natures of opposition and following are the entire essence that follows conditions, therefore it is said to be the phenomena that are always divided within principle.

['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c23_8']	二因順故二心俱泯者，可不可也。	二因順故二心俱泯者，可不可也。	Second, because of following the nature, both minds are extinguished, which is possible or impossible.

['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c24_15']	不可因逆順二事同一心性，便令迷逆之事作了順邪！	不可因逆順二事同一心性，便令迷逆之事作了順邪！	One cannot, because the two states of going against and following are the same in mind-nature, make the deluded state of going against become the enlightened state of following!
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c25_6']	此乃責其不分迷悟也。	此乃責其不分迷悟也。	This is to blame him for not distinguishing between delusion and enlightenment.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c26_4']	故正立理云，故須一期迷了照性成修。	故正立理云，故須一期迷了照性成修。	Therefore, the correct principle is established: Thus, one must temporarily go from delusion to enlightenment, and illuminate the nature to accomplish cultivation.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0713c27_6']	言一期者，即與一往之語同類，乃非終畢之義也。	言一期者，即與一往之語同類，乃非終畢之義也。	The word temporarily is of the same kind as the word once, and it is not the meaning of final completion.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0714a01_6']	蓋言雖據寂理二修終泯，且須一期改迷為了，了心若發必照性成修，若見性修心自然二心俱泯，此義顯然如指諸掌，人何惑焉？	蓋言雖據寂理二修終泯，且須一期改迷為了，了心若發必照性成修，若見性修心自然二心俱泯，此義顯然如指諸掌，人何惑焉？	It is said that although the two cultivations based on the principle of quiescence will ultimately be merged, one must temporarily change from delusion to enlightenment. If the enlightened mind is aroused, one will certainly illuminate the nature to accomplish cultivation. If one sees the nature and cultivates the mind, the two minds will naturally both be merged. This meaning is evident like fingers pointing to the palm. How can people be confused about this?
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0714a03_14']	豈非逆修如病、順修如藥，雖知藥病終須兩亡，一往且須服藥治病，藥力若効其身必康，身若安康藥病俱泯。	豈非逆修如病、順修如藥，雖知藥病終須兩亡，一往且須服藥治病，藥力若効其身必康，身若安康藥病俱泯。	Isn't it that cultivating against is like illness, and cultivating in accordance is like medicine? Although one knows that medicine and illness will ultimately both disappear, one must temporarily take medicine to treat illness. If the efficacy of the medicine is effective, the body will certainly be well. If the body is well, medicine and illness will both disappear.

Although establishing realization and cultivation, each is without action. Therefore, diligently cultivating wisdom is like a dream, and there is nothing to distinguish at all.

The cause is like an illusion because it cannot attract, and the effect is like an image because it is not something to be attained.

Although the image has no nature, its form and appearance are still vivid. Therefore, it is said that emptiness is void while the image is real.

The name of delusion is eternally lost, and it transforms into the nature of understanding. Therefore, it is said that delusion transforms into the nature.

The true aspect in principle is the cause of defilement, even if it is endowed with Buddha-dharmas, it is still called ignorance because it is not yet manifest.

The principle of delusion and enlightenment is one, like when Revata lost his head and got his head back, the head was never different. Therefore it is said that ignorance is precisely illumination.

The principle endowment of the three thousand is all called essence, and the transformation creation of the three thousand is all called function.

The third clarifies that the three thousand of cause and effect are just one three thousand, because there is no change. The fourth clarifies that the essence of the three thousand of cause and effect is all able to give rise to function. Then, the three thousand in the cause give rise to defiled function, and the three thousand on the effect give rise to pure function. This fourth statement clarifies the perfect most clearly.

Differentiation is the characteristic of ignorance, and purity is the characteristic of true suchness. When following conditions, there is differentiation; when not following conditions, there is no differentiation. Therefore, it is known that the one nature only has differentiation when combined with ignorance. This is precisely the meaning of combination, not the non-duality of essence, because when ignorance is eliminated, there is no differentiation.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0715b20_12']	今家明三千之體隨緣起三千之用，不隨緣時三千宛爾，故差別法與體不二，以除無明有差別故。	今家明三千之體隨緣起三千之用，不隨緣時三千宛爾，故差別法與體不二，以除無明有差別故。	Our school explains that the essence of the three thousand follows conditions to give rise to the function of the three thousand. When not following conditions, the three thousand are still apparent. Therefore, differentiated dharmas are not two with the essence, because when ignorance is eliminated, there is differentiation.

It is not easy to investigate and understand. One should know that if one does not discuss the inherent inclusion of principle and simply speaks of true suchness following conditions, it is still the meaning of difference.

Therefore, we know that only when both inherent inclusion and transformation are clearly explained is it called identity. If either one is lacking, it is not the ultimate perfection.

Ignorance covers reality, and both the coverer and the covered are called unmoving.

This shows that only the principle follows conditions to create the nine, and has no function of complete ignorance.

The entire substance of the three thousand of tranquil illumination is completely dark and moving, which is precisely turned into ignorance.

Moreover, the dependent and the correct of defilement and purity must merge, which is precisely the spiritual powers and the ability to respond. Since it is accomplished by oneself, it must be called self. It only does not discuss stimulus, and stimulus is the other's faculties. Although self and other are distinguished, they are the same in a single thought. Therefore, the above text says, The other's birth and other Buddhas are still the same as the mind, let alone one's own mind and the Buddhas, how could they deviate from a single thought?

If one's own Buddha nature manifests, then it is the same as the Buddha nature of others, both becoming the able to transform. Only the Buddha nature of other sentient beings is to be transformed.

Since the three thousand are identical to emptiness, provisional, and the middle, they are the three virtuous qualities and the three truths of the three thousand.

In benefiting others, the net of Indra is interwoven, and the three thousand worlds are all provisional. Since the three truths are identical, the one and the three are distinguished but not distinguished.

The detailed analysis is the three thousand, and the general discussion is the ten realms. The transformation and manifestation mutually produce the indeterminate transformation, and the transformation transforms again. The dependent and the correct are all so. The response must correspond to the moved capacity. How could it not be so?

All Buddhas realize the principle, and sentient beings are in phenomena. The principle of the three thousand is fulfilled. If a single stimulus does not elicit a response, then one could say that the three thousand are mutually lacking. Since there is no such principle, the previous meaning is well established.

When the heavy obstructions and weak capacity of sentient beings are referred to as being separated from the mirror, when the capacity is accomplished, it is referred to as facing. If it faces, there is ultimately no failure to reflect.

The nature originally possesses all, and the biased development is due to perfuming. Since the nature subsumes cultivation, cultivation is like an illusion. In the equal Dharma realm, the Buddha does not liberate beings. Without distinction, he temporarily establishes essence and response. The joy of responding is originally empty, so they are all like an illusion.
['ZH_T46_1928_002:0719a28_8']	然此尚非但理隨緣之幻，豈同緣生無體之幻邪？	然此尚非但理隨緣之幻，豈同緣生無體之幻邪？	However, this is not merely the illusion of the principle of following conditions. How can it be the same as the illusion of conditioned arising without substance?

The nine are just the three, each possessing the three, with unobstructed combination and separation.

If one does not subsume it within the mind-dharma, how can one accomplish one's own and others' goals? Therefore, the Essentials have no greater function than this.

It is just that the wonderful meaning is difficult to understand, so in the section, the interpretation of the teachings and the understanding of the meaning are strong, while the contemplation is merely shown indirectly.

Therefore, the Yilei says, Only relying on the original and traces to reveal the truth. You should know that the Zhiguan uses this wonderful meaning as the ability to stop and the ability to contemplate. The inconceivable realm is contemplation itself, so the three obstacles and four demons are what is stopped and contemplated.

These ten gates wish to be the same as the Zhiguan in forming the essence of contemplation, all exclusively explaining it using the Dharma of the mind.
