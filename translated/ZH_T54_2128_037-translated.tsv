Great officers wear a dark-colored sash with a jade pendant. Crown princes wear a black-colored sash with a jade pendant. Scholars wear a plain-colored sash with a jade pendant.

The Xintangshu (Annals of the Later Han Dynasty) says: In ancient times, the wearing of jade pendants was arranged according to rank. During the five hegemonies, wars continued without cease. The jade pendant was not a weapon for battle, and the bow was not a flag for soldiers. Therefore, they untied the bow and pendant, and kept the silk knot as a symbol. Since the bow and pendant were abolished, Qin then used colored tassels to connect to the knot. For high-ranking officials, a ring or jade disc was added as a bright symbol. They were connected in turn with sashes, thus called sashes. Sash is also a belt.
