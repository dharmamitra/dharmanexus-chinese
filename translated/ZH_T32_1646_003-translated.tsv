['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c07_13']	是經中問異答異，是和蹉梵志所計身異神異，故如是答：	是經中問異答異，是和蹉梵志所計身異神異，故如是答：	In this sūtra, the question is different and the answer is different. This Vātsīputrīya Brāhmaṇa conceives of the body as different from the spirit, so he answers like this:
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c08_1']	中陰中有五陰。	中陰中有五陰。	In the intermediate state, there are five aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c09_16']	又汝言有中有滅者，是人於欲色界中間受身，於此中滅，故名有中有滅也。	又汝言有中有滅者，是人於欲色界中間受身，於此中滅，故名有中有滅也。	Moreover, you say that there is cessation in the intermediate state, meaning that this person receives a body in the intermediate state between the desire realm and the form realm, and ceases in this intermediate state, so it is called cessation in the intermediate state.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c10_3']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c11_7']	如經中說若人死何處、去何處、在何處，是義無異。	如經中說若人死何處、去何處、在何處，是義無異。	As the sutra says, If a person dies, where do they go? Where do they come from? Where are they? This meaning is no different.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c12_16']	又汝言雜受身雜生世間者，若言受身、言生世間，是義不異。	又汝言雜受身雜生世間者，若言受身、言生世間，是義不異。	Moreover, you say that the body is mixed and beings are born in the world. If you say the body is received and beings are born in the world, this meaning is no different.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c14_1']	又汝言四有七有者，是經不然，以不順法相故。	又汝言四有七有者，是經不然，以不順法相故。	Moreover, you say there are four existences and seven existences. This sutra is not so, because it does not accord with the characteristics of dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c15_1']	又汝言閻王呵責者，此在生有，非中有也。	又汝言閻王呵責者，此在生有，非中有也。	Moreover, you say that King Yama reproaches. This is in the existence of birth, not in the intermediate existence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c16_15']	又汝言佛因中陰知宿命者，是事不然，聖智力爾，雖不相續亦能念知。	又汝言佛因中陰知宿命者，是事不然，聖智力爾，雖不相續亦能念知。	Moreover, you say that the Buddha knows past lives through the intermediate existence. This is not so. The power of holy wisdom is such that even without continuity, he can still remember and know.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c18_7']	又汝言天眼見死時生時者，欲生名生時，將死名死時，非中陰也。	又汝言天眼見死時生時者，欲生名生時，將死名死時，非中陰也。	Moreover, you say that the heavenly eye sees death and birth. Desire to be born is called the time of birth, and about to die is called the time of death, not the intermediate existence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c20_3']	又汝言眾生為陰所縛從此至彼者，示有後世故如是說，不明有中陰也。	又汝言眾生為陰所縛從此至彼者，示有後世故如是說，不明有中陰也。	Moreover, you say that beings are bound by the aggregates and go from here to there. This is said to show the afterlife, not to clarify the existence of the intermediate state.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c21_12']	又汝言死時有微四大去者，世人所見，不可信也，此非用因。	又汝言死時有微四大去者，世人所見，不可信也，此非用因。	Moreover, your statement that at the time of death there is a subtle four elements that goes is what ordinary people see, and cannot be trusted. This is not a valid reason.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c24_5']	又汝言若無中陰中間應斷者，以業力故，此人生此、彼人生彼，如過去未來雖不相續而能憶念，是故無有中陰。	又汝言若無中陰中間應斷者，以業力故，此人生此、彼人生彼，如過去未來雖不相續而能憶念，是故無有中陰。	Furthermore, your statement that if there is no intermediate existence, it should be cut off in the middle, is because of the power of karma that this person is born here and that person is born there. Just as in the past and future, although there is no continuity, one is still able to remember. Therefore, there is no intermediate existence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c25_12']	復次宿命智中說知此人此間死彼間生，不說住中陰中。	復次宿命智中說知此人此間死彼間生，不說住中陰中。	Moreover, in the knowledge of past lives, it is said to know that this person dies here and is born there, but it does not say that they dwell in the intermediate existence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c27_2']	復次佛說三種業，現報、生報及後報業，不說有中陰報業。	復次佛說三種業，現報、生報及後報業，不說有中陰報業。	Furthermore, the Buddha speaks of three kinds of karma: karma with present retribution, karma with retribution in the next life, and karma with retribution in a later life. He does not speak of karma with retribution in the intermediate existence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0256c29_2']	復次若中陰有觸即名生有，若不能觸是則無觸，觸無故受等亦無，如是何所有耶？	復次若中陰有觸即名生有，若不能觸是則無觸，觸無故受等亦無，如是何所有耶？	Moreover, if the intermediate existence has contact, it is then called the existence at birth. If it cannot have contact, then it has no contact. Because of the absence of contact, feeling and so forth are also absent. What is there like this?
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a01_3']	又若眾生受中陰形，即名受生，如經中說：	又若眾生受中陰形，即名受生，如經中說：	Moreover, if sentient beings receive the form of the intermediate existence, it is then called receiving birth. As it is said in the sutra:
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a01_18']	若人捨此身受餘身者，我說名生。	若人捨此身受餘身者，我說名生。	If a person abandons this body and receives another body, I say it is called birth.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a02_9']	若不受身，則無中陰。	若不受身，則無中陰。	If one does not receive a body, then there is no intermediate existence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a03_3']	復次若中陰有退，即名為生。	復次若中陰有退，即名為生。	Furthermore, if there is regression in the intermediate existence, it is then called birth.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a03_8']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a03_15']	要先生後退故；	要先生後退故；	It is because one must first be born and then regress;
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a04_4']	若無退是則為常。	若無退是則為常。	if there is no regression, then it is permanent.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a04_16']	又以業力故生，何用中陰？	又以業力故生，何用中陰？	Moreover, it is born due to the power of karma. What use is there for an intermediate existence?
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a05_18']	又若中陰從業成者，即是生有，如說業因緣生；	又若中陰從業成者，即是生有，如說業因緣生；	Moreover, if the intermediate existence is formed from karma, then it is the existence at birth, just as it is said that karma is the condition for birth;
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a06_10']	若不從業成，何由而有？	若不從業成，何由而有？	if it is not formed from karma, then how does it exist?
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a06_15']	是應速答。	是應速答。	This should be answered quickly.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a06_18']	答曰：	答曰：	The answer is:
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a07_17']	我以生有差別說名中陰，是故無如上過。	我以生有差別說名中陰，是故無如上過。	I say that the difference between the existence at birth is called the intermediate existence, and therefore there is no such fault as above.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a09_7']	是人雖中陰生，亦與生有異，能令識到迦羅羅中是名中陰。	是人雖中陰生，亦與生有異，能令識到迦羅羅中是名中陰。	Although this person is born in the intermediate existence, it is also different from the existence at birth. Causing consciousness to reach the kalala stage is called the intermediate existence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a09_10']	難曰：	難曰：	The objection is:
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a10_7']	以業力能至，何用分別說中陰耶？	以業力能至，何用分別說中陰耶？	Since the power of karma can reach there, what is the use of distinguishing and speaking of an intermediate existence?
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a11_11']	又心無所至，以業因緣故，從此間滅、於彼處生。	又心無所至，以業因緣故，從此間滅、於彼處生。	Moreover, the mind does not go anywhere. It ceases here and arises there due to the causes and conditions of karma.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a13_15']	又現見心不相續生，如人刺足頭中覺痛，此足中識無有因緣至於頭中，以近遠眾緣和合生心。	又現見心不相續生，如人刺足頭中覺痛，此足中識無有因緣至於頭中，以近遠眾緣和合生心。	Moreover, it is directly seen that the mind does not arise in continuity. For example, when a person is pricked in the foot, they feel pain in the head. The consciousness in the foot has no causal conditions to reach the head. The mind arises due to the convergence of many distant and proximate conditions.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a14_8']	是故不應分別計有中陰。	是故不應分別計有中陰。	Therefore, one should not discriminate and conceive of an intermediate existence.

['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a19_16']	若人見世間集即滅無見，見世間滅即滅有見。	若人見世間集即滅無見，見世間滅即滅有見。	If a person sees the arising of the world, they eliminate the view of annihilation. If they see the cessation of the world, they eliminate the view of eternalism.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a20_7']	當知集滅二相各異。	當知集滅二相各異。	One should know that the two aspects of arising and cessation are each different.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a21_12']	又若人能知所有集相皆是滅相，是名離垢得法眼淨。	又若人能知所有集相皆是滅相，是名離垢得法眼淨。	Moreover, if one can know that all characteristics of accumulation are characteristics of cessation, this is called being free from defilements and attaining the purity of the Dharma eye.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a22_14']	又說利智慧人漸捨諸惡，如練金師能離身垢。	又說利智慧人漸捨諸惡，如練金師能離身垢。	It is also said that a person of sharp wisdom gradually abandons all evils, just as a goldsmith can remove the impurities of gold.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a23_3']	又《漏盡經》說：	又《漏盡經》說：	Moreover, the Sutra on the Extinction of Outflows states:
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a23_12']	能知見者則漏得盡。	能知見者則漏得盡。	One who can know and see can extinguish the outflows.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a24_13']	行者不能自知日日所盡，常修習故得盡諸漏。	行者不能自知日日所盡，常修習故得盡諸漏。	The practitioner cannot know for himself what he has extinguished day by day, but by constantly cultivating, he can extinguish all outflows.

['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257a26_8']	於諸諦中能生眼智明慧，欲界苦中二、色無色界二，集等亦爾。	於諸諦中能生眼智明慧，欲界苦中二、色無色界二，集等亦爾。	In regard to the truths, one can give rise to the eye, knowledge, illumination, and wisdom. In the suffering of the desire realm, there are two, and in the form and formless realms, there are two. The same is true for the origination, etc.

Therefore, the undefiled knowledge should also engage in four kinds of correct practices in sequence.
['ZH_T32_1646_003:0257b03_8']	又行者應定心分別是苦、是苦因、是苦滅、是苦滅道，若一心中，何得如是決定分別？	又行者應定心分別是苦、是苦因、是苦滅、是苦滅道，若一心中，何得如是決定分別？	Moreover, the practitioner should discern with a concentrated mind that this is suffering, this is the cause of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, and this is the path to the cessation of suffering. If it were in a single thought, how could there be such definite discernment?
