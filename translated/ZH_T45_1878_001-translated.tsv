['ZH_T45_1878_001:0653c20_11']	此則事無別事，即全理為事，是故菩薩雖復看事，即是觀理，然說此事為不即理。	此則事無別事，即全理為事，是故菩薩雖復看事，即是觀理，然說此事為不即理。	001	This means that phenomena have no separate phenomena, but are completely principle as phenomena. Therefore, although bodhisattvas observe phenomena, they are actually contemplating principle. However, these phenomena are said to be not identical with principle.
['ZH_T45_1878_001:0653c22_4']	二、事如理門，謂諸事法與理非異，故事隨理而圓遍，遂令一塵普遍法界；	二、事如理門，謂諸事法與理非異，故事隨理而圓遍，遂令一塵普遍法界；	001	Second, the phenomena are like the principle gate, which means that all phenomena are not different from principle, so phenomena follow principle and are universally pervasive. As a result, a single dust mote pervades the entire Dharma realm;

Therefore, one can contain the ocean of ten directions without destroying a single dust mote;

['ZH_T45_1878_001:0654a14_5']	是故此一塵自遍他時，即他遍自，能容、能入同時，遍、攝無礙。	是故此一塵自遍他時，即他遍自，能容、能入同時，遍、攝無礙。	001	Therefore, when this single dust mote pervades others, it also pervades itself, and at the same time it can contain and enter without obstruction.
