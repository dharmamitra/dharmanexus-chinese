['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891a14_6']	「善男子聲聞之人有肉眼者，說有調魔，不為脩學大乘人說，故聲聞之人雖有天眼名為肉眼，學大乘者雖有肉眼名為佛眼。	「善男子聲聞之人有肉眼者，說有調魔，不為脩學大乘人說，故聲聞之人雖有天眼名為肉眼，學大乘者雖有肉眼名為佛眼。	011	Good sons, the sravakas who have the flesh eye say there is taming of Mara, but do not speak of it for those who study the Mahayana. Therefore, although the sravakas have the heavenly eye, it is called the flesh eye. Those who study the Mahayana, although they have the flesh eye, it is called the Buddha eye.

If one looks at the Buddha eye, the wisdom eye is still called the flesh eye, because it has not yet seen the emptiness of the middle.

['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891b18_6']	三十信之名通上中，但舉伏名為例，故云「可解」。	三十信之名通上中，但舉伏名為例，故云「可解」。	011	The names of the thirty understandings are common to the upper and middle [stages], but only the name of subduing is mentioned as an example, so it is said can be understood.

The six sense faculties are called similar phenomena and principles, and even up to the stage of principle-nature, phenomena and principles, and so on.

['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c03_15']	初云「約因論果」，即因義通果，「約果論因」，即果義通因。	初云「約因論果」，即因義通果，「約果論因」，即果義通因。	011	First, it says based on the cause to discuss the effect, which is the meaning of the cause penetrating the effect, based on the effect to discuss the cause, which is the meaning of the effect penetrating the cause.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c04_18']	次「大經」下舉別以釋通，先舉別，故云「是果非因」等。	次「大經」下舉別以釋通，先舉別，故云「是果非因」等。	011	Next, below the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, it raises the specific to explain the general, first raising the specific, therefore saying this is the effect, not the cause, etc.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c05_16']	次釋別令通，云「了見佛性」，亦得名因。	次釋別令通，云「了見佛性」，亦得名因。	011	Next, it explains the specific to make it general, saying clearly seeing the Buddha-nature can also be called the cause.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c07_6']	言「云云」者，亦應更言脩涅槃故乃得名因，證涅槃故亦得名果。	言「云云」者，亦應更言脩涅槃故乃得名因，證涅槃故亦得名果。	011	As for and so on, it should also be said that because one cultivates nirvana, it is called a cause, and because one realizes nirvana, it is also called a result.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c08_4']	次「等覺」下重以因果之名，以判證位。	次「等覺」下重以因果之名，以判證位。	011	Next, below equal enlightenment, it again uses the names of cause and effect to distinguish the stage of realization.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c09_17']	「等覺望妙覺為因」者，今一往以等覺為因，妙覺為果，下地已去有重因果。	「等覺望妙覺為因」者，今一往以等覺為因，妙覺為果，下地已去有重因果。	011	Equal enlightenment is the cause for wondrous enlightenment means that now, provisionally, equal enlightenment is the cause and wondrous enlightenment is the result. Below this, there are repeated causes and effects.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c11_1']	所言「亦因亦因因」等者，《大經》二十五〈師子吼品〉云：	所言「亦因亦因因」等者，《大經》二十五〈師子吼品〉云：	011	As for what is said about also cause and also cause of cause and so on, the Great Sutra, chapter 25 on the Chapter on the Lion's Roar, says:
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c14_12']	「佛性者，亦因亦因因，亦果亦果果」，初以十二緣為因，因因者名為智慧，果者即阿耨菩提，果果者大般涅槃，故知經意以十二因緣為理性三因，故名為因。	「佛性者，亦因亦因因，亦果亦果果」，初以十二緣為因，因因者名為智慧，果者即阿耨菩提，果果者大般涅槃，故知經意以十二因緣為理性三因，故名為因。	011	Buddha-nature is also cause and also cause of cause, also result and also result of result. Initially, the twelve conditions are taken as the cause. The cause of cause is called wisdom. The result is supreme, perfect enlightenment. The result of result is great parinirvāṇa. Therefore, it is known that the meaning of the sūtra takes the twelve conditions as the three causes of the principle of reality, and is therefore called cause.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c15_12']	觀因緣智，望果是因，因上起因故云因因。	觀因緣智，望果是因，因上起因故云因因。	011	The wisdom of contemplating causes and conditions, in relation to effects, is the cause, and the cause that arises from the cause is called the cause of the cause.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c16_17']	菩提望因，名之為果，菩提果上又加涅槃，名為果果。	菩提望因，名之為果，菩提果上又加涅槃，名為果果。	011	Bodhi, in relation to the cause, is called the effect, and on top of the effect of bodhi, nirvana is further added, called the effect of the effect.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0891c19_10']	次以十二因緣為譬云，如無明為因、行為果，行為因、識為果，以是義故彼無明體，亦因亦因因，亦果亦果果。	次以十二因緣為譬云，如無明為因、行為果，行為因、識為果，以是義故彼無明體，亦因亦因因，亦果亦果果。	011	Next, using the twelve links of dependent origination as an analogy, it says, For example, ignorance is the cause, and action is the effect. Action is the cause, and consciousness is the effect. For this reason, the substance of that ignorance is both the cause and the cause of the cause, and both the effect and the effect of the effect.

For example, the two rises of the Flower Ornament Sutra and the one rise of the Deer Park, up to the one rise of the Lotus Sutra, each has its reason, therefore it is not discussed.

Sometimes there are no matters or principles, but people give rise to understanding. Understanding has skillful and clumsy aspects, so it is divided into matters and principles;

The previous discussions of abandonment and continuation are all based on the teachings before the Lotus Sūtra. Since the three provisional teachings are explained in contrast to the one true teaching, the Lotus Sūtra is used to make the distinction.

Therefore, they are now opened up, so that the four initial stages are no different from the principle contemplated by the initial stage of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0894c27_13']	次歷圓教諸位入妙不同者，即有按位進入二妙。	次歷圓教諸位入妙不同者，即有按位進入二妙。	011	Next, in the different ways of entering the wonderful [stage] through the various stages of the perfect teaching, there are two kinds of entering the wonderful [stage]: entering through the stages and entering through advancement.

['ZH_T33_1717_011:0894c28_13']	互有強弱。	互有強弱。	011	Each has its strengths and weaknesses.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0895a02_8']	若論當位即是即按位為勝，若據聞教能超，即進入為勝，以在本位未知是妙，待入圓已方乃知妙，故成少劣；	若論當位即是即按位為勝，若據聞教能超，即進入為勝，以在本位未知是妙，待入圓已方乃知妙，故成少劣；	011	If discussing the stage itself, then entering through the stages is superior; if discussing the ability to transcend through hearing the teachings, then entering through advancement is superior. Because in one's own stage one does not yet know it is wonderful, one waits to enter the perfect [stage] before knowing it is wonderful, so it becomes slightly inferior;
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0895a02_19']	以進入功深，是故復勝。	以進入功深，是故復勝。	011	because the merit of entering through advancement is profound, it is therefore again superior.

The poison was placed in the past and only now is it activated. The Lotus Sutra is not an indeterminate teaching, but it is the same as the poison being activated when one hears the disclosure of skillful means at that very seat and is able to destroy ignorance. Since the various stages are different, it is somewhat similar to the indeterminate, so the words of placing poison to kill people are borrowed.

The previous three teachings are called small countries. The teacher of the teachings and below are all called ministers. The high positions among the ministers are called great. The two teachings of arhats and the ninth ground of the Shared Teaching, and the tenth abode of the Distinct Teaching, are opened and enter the Perfect Teaching, which is called coming to court.

Too much joy still hinders the Way, how much more so for delusion and anger?

Relying on reality to give rise to views still damages the wisdom-life, how much more so for biased vehicles to give rise to attachment?

The teaching path of the separate teaching also takes the expedient practices before the grounds as the essence of the vehicle.

['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b14_1']	「轉二乘心入菩薩位，第一義中一相尚無，故無所轉、無菩薩位。	「轉二乘心入菩薩位，第一義中一相尚無，故無所轉、無菩薩位。	011	Turning the minds of the Two Vehicles and entering the stage of bodhisattvas, in the ultimate truth there is not even one characteristic, so there is nothing to turn and no stage of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b15_14']	」此約三乘理性不當轉與不轉，今亦約理而為體用，理體無退故皆跋致。	」此約三乘理性不當轉與不轉，今亦約理而為體用，理體無退故皆跋致。	011	This is about the principle of the Three Vehicles not being appropriate to turn or not to turn. Now it is also about principle as essence and function. The essence of principle is without regression, so they all reach the end.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b19_5']	「動不動皆毘尼」者，人天毘尼名為不動，無漏毘尼名之為動，雖世出世皆名毘尼，若約理論無動不動，故約理性無非毘尼，皆具足有一心十戒故也。	「動不動皆毘尼」者，人天毘尼名為不動，無漏毘尼名之為動，雖世出世皆名毘尼，若約理論無動不動，故約理性無非毘尼，皆具足有一心十戒故也。	011	Moving and unmoving are all vinaya means that the vinaya of humans and gods is called unmoving, and the pure vinaya is called moving. Although both worldly and transcendent are called vinaya, if based on principle there is no movement or unmoving. Therefore, based on principle there is none that is not vinaya, because they all possess the ten precepts of the one mind.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b20_2']	故圓教乘無發不發，皆名為乘。	故圓教乘無發不發，皆名為乘。	011	Therefore, in the Perfect Teaching, whether one practices or not, it is all called the vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b21_15']	然此四教各具三軌，非但深淺不同，亦乃乘體誠異，以諸乘體不同故也。	然此四教各具三軌，非但深淺不同，亦乃乘體誠異，以諸乘體不同故也。	011	However, these four teachings each possess the three tracks. Not only are they different in depth, but the essence of the vehicles is also truly different, because the essence of the various vehicles is not the same.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b25_2']	所以藏別兩教咸以智慧為體，通圓兩教咸以真性為體者，良以體為所乘，未可暫廢，以藏別真性果滿方成，儻指體在，當以何為運？	所以藏別兩教咸以智慧為體，通圓兩教咸以真性為體者，良以體為所乘，未可暫廢，以藏別真性果滿方成，儻指體在，當以何為運？	011	Therefore, both the Tripiṭaka and Distinct Teachings take wisdom as their essence, while both the Shared and Perfect Teachings take true nature as their essence. The reason is that the essence is what is ridden, and cannot be temporarily abandoned. In the Tripiṭaka and Distinct Teachings, true nature is only accomplished upon the completion of fruition. If one points to the essence, then what should be used to ride it?
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b27_4']	若用觀照，則從始至終，故通圓居因即事論性，即事之性果位乃窮，是故兩教真為乘體。	若用觀照，則從始至終，故通圓居因即事論性，即事之性果位乃窮，是故兩教真為乘體。	011	If one uses contemplation and insight, then it is from beginning to end. Therefore, in the Shared and Perfect Teachings, even while still on the causal ground, one discusses the nature of phenomena. The nature of phenomena is exhausted only in the fruition ground. Therefore, the true nature is the essence of the vehicle in both of these two teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897b28_6']	又前之兩教通雖稍優並不知常，置而不說；	又前之兩教通雖稍優並不知常，置而不說；	011	Moreover, although the Shared Teaching is slightly superior, it still does not know permanence, so it is not discussed.

['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897c01_7']	圓雖理極尚有始終，恐世濫行，故須委辨。	圓雖理極尚有始終，恐世濫行，故須委辨。	011	Although the principle of the Perfect Teaching is ultimate, it still has a beginning and end. Fearing that the world would mistakenly practice it, it must be carefully distinguished.

['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897c03_15']	若得此意，別顯一科，義猶指掌，如迷此者自行何依？	若得此意，別顯一科，義猶指掌，如迷此者自行何依？	011	If one understands this, the separate explanation of a section is still like pointing to the palm. If one is confused about this, on what basis does one practice oneself?

['ZH_T33_1717_011:0897c06_4']	能乘所至一切都廢，是則以火宅為寶渚，必為所燒；	能乘所至一切都廢，是則以火宅為寶渚，必為所燒；	011	The one who rides and the destination are both completely abandoned. This is like taking the burning house as a treasure island, and will surely be burned.
