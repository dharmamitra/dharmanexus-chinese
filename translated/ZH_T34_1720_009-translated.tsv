['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c09_6']	一乘難信，恐釋迦化偏，故古佛證，顯諸佛道同，非釋迦偏化也。	一乘難信，恐釋迦化偏，故古佛證，顯諸佛道同，非釋迦偏化也。	The One Vehicle is difficult to believe in, and it is feared that Shakyamuni's teaching is biased, so the ancient Buddhas testify to show that the ways of all Buddhas are the same, and it is not that Shakyamuni's teaching is biased.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c13_13']	如是等義，故證前也。	如是等義，故證前也。	For these and other meanings, it is thus proven.

It wishes to reveal non-birth and non-extinction as the true body, and birth and extinction as the expedient, thus opening the door of expedient means of the body and revealing the meaning of the true reality of the body.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c19_1']	二者集分身開本一迹多。	二者集分身開本一迹多。	Second, it gathers the transformed bodies and reveals the one original and many traces.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c19_16']	既互相為分身，則知彼此皆是迹。	既互相為分身，則知彼此皆是迹。	Since they mutually transform into each other, then one knows that both are traces.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c20_17']	彼此皆是迹，必有統一之本，故本一而迹多。	彼此皆是迹，必有統一之本，故本一而迹多。	Both of these are traces, there must be a unifying basis, therefore the basis is one while the traces are many.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c21_15']	迹多故開身方便門，本一故顯身真實也。	迹多故開身方便門，本一故顯身真實也。	Because the traces are many, it opens the door of expedient means of the body; because the basis is one, it reveals the true reality of the body.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c24_9']	三者命覓弘經之人，因此則有〈持品〉，乃至他方菩薩奉命弘經，如來便得止其宣持，顯下方菩薩廣開壽量久已證常也。	三者命覓弘經之人，因此則有〈持品〉，乃至他方菩薩奉命弘經，如來便得止其宣持，顯下方菩薩廣開壽量久已證常也。	Third, it seeks people to propagate the sutra, based on this there is the chapter on upholding [the sutra], up to bodhisattvas from other directions who accept the order to propagate the sutra. The Tathagata then gets to stop their proclamation and upholding, revealing that bodhisattvas from the lower regions extensively open the lifespan [of the Buddha] that has long been realized to be eternal.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c24_18']	何故但明此三？	何故但明此三？	Why only clarify these three?

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c26_19']	顯身是常，必具三義，一者體無生滅、二唯一法身、三本來是有，備此三門常義乃圓矣。	顯身是常，必具三義，一者體無生滅、二唯一法身、三本來是有，備此三門常義乃圓矣。	Revealing the body to be eternal, it must have three meanings: first, the essence is without arising or ceasing; second, there is only the one Dharma body; third, it has originally existed. Equipped with these three aspects, the meaning of permanence is complete.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c27_5']	此據理釋之。	此據理釋之。	This is a rational explanation.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c27_16']	又雖有三義，束而成兩：	又雖有三義，束而成兩：	Moreover, although there are three meanings, they can be summarized into two:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0433c29_19']	體無生滅唯一法身，則常義已現，但未知為始證常、為久證常，故說壽量，明久已成佛也。	體無生滅唯一法身，則常義已現，但未知為始證常、為久證常，故說壽量，明久已成佛也。	The essence is unborn and unceasing, and there is only the one Dharma body, then the meaning of permanence is already manifest, but it is still unknown whether it is newly realized permanence or long-realized permanence, therefore the lifespan is explained, clarifying that he has long since become a Buddha.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a02_8']	但明現塔證所說不虛，唯應如光宅所明，云何用此開於本迹？	但明現塔證所說不虛，唯應如光宅所明，云何用此開於本迹？	It only clarifies the manifestation of the stupa to prove that what is said is not false, it should be like what is explained by Guangzhai, how can this be used to reveal the original and traces?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a02_10']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a05_11']	下偈云「多寶如來及與我身，所集化佛當知此意」者，夫聖人言近而意遠，不可齊事而求之佛，恐尋言失旨，故唱當知此意以驚悟之耳。	下偈云「多寶如來及與我身，所集化佛當知此意」者，夫聖人言近而意遠，不可齊事而求之佛，恐尋言失旨，故唱當知此意以驚悟之耳。	The verse below says Many Treasures Tathagata and my body, the transformed Buddhas gathered, one should know this meaning. The words of the sage are near but the meaning is far, one cannot seek it by equating the events with the Buddha, fearing that seeking the words will lose the meaning, therefore it is proclaimed that one should know this meaning to awaken them.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a06_17']	若意唯存受持弘宣者，則已顯之於言，豈曰此意難知？	若意唯存受持弘宣者，則已顯之於言，豈曰此意難知？	If the meaning only resides in upholding and propagating, then it has already been revealed in the words, how can it be said that this meaning is difficult to know?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a07_9']	復何煩唱言當知此意也。	復何煩唱言當知此意也。	How much more so to trouble to proclaim that one should know this meaning?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a08_14']	又若現塔但為證前說者，何煩放光集佛、開塔並坐？	又若現塔但為證前說者，何煩放光集佛、開塔並坐？	Moreover, if the manifestation of the stupa is only to prove the previous explanation, why trouble to emit light, gather Buddhas, open the stupa, and sit together?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a08_19']	意在何耶？	意在何耶？	What is the intention behind this?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a09_8']	故知皆為開本迹耳。	故知皆為開本迹耳。	Therefore, we know that it is all for revealing the original and subsequent [teachings].

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a10_17']	此乃是多寶本願，開我塔必須集分身佛，亦非表本迹義也。	此乃是多寶本願，開我塔必須集分身佛，亦非表本迹義也。	This is indeed the original vow of Prabhūtaratna, which requires the gathering of the transformed Buddhas in order to open the stupa. It is not the meaning of revealing the original and subsequent [teachings].
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a11_1']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a12_2']	若不詑多寶願，何由得集分身佛明本迹義耶？	若不詑多寶願，何由得集分身佛明本迹義耶？	If it were not for the vow of Prabhūtaratna, how could the transformed Buddhas be gathered to clarify the meaning of the original and subsequent [teachings]?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a12_11']	當知此意顯於茲矣。	當知此意顯於茲矣。	We should know that this intention is evident here.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a12_19']	又多寶實有此願。	又多寶實有此願。	Moreover, Prabhūtaratna truly has this vow.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a14_6']	所以然者，諸佛各有誓願，如身子成佛願於淨土而說三乘。	所以然者，諸佛各有誓願，如身子成佛願於淨土而說三乘。	The reason for this is that all Buddhas have their own vows, just as Śāriputra, upon becoming a Buddha, vowed to expound the Three Vehicles in a pure land.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a16_8']	多寶本願因此塔以開本迹，以惑者皆謂居在塔者必是身已滅亡，故寄塔以表法身常住也。	多寶本願因此塔以開本迹，以惑者皆謂居在塔者必是身已滅亡，故寄塔以表法身常住也。	Prabhūtaratna's original vow is to open the original and subsequent [teachings] based on this stupa, because those who are confused all think that one who resides in the stupa must be one whose body has already perished, so he uses the stupa to symbolize the eternal abiding of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a16_10']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a17_12']	若爾，一切佛皆得以塔涌開於本迹，何止多寶耶？	若爾，一切佛皆得以塔涌開於本迹，何止多寶耶？	If that is so, then all Buddhas can use the emergence of the stupa to reveal the original and subsequent [teachings], why stop at just Prabhūtaratna?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a17_14']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a17_19']	實如所問。	實如所問。	It is truly as you have asked.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a18_15']	但多寶即以此事為願，故開本迹也。	但多寶即以此事為願，故開本迹也。	However, since Prabhūtaratna made this matter his vow, he revealed his original and trace [bodies].
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a19_19']	又所以明多寶願者，以塔現故，寄古佛以明法身常；	又所以明多寶願者，以塔現故，寄古佛以明法身常；	Moreover, the reason for clarifying Prabhūtaratna's vow is that since the stūpa appeared, he borrowed the ancient Buddha to clarify that the Dharma body is permanent;
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a20_12']	以本願故，集化身以顯本一。	以本願故，集化身以顯本一。	because of the original vow, he gathered the transformed bodies to reveal the original unity.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a21_8']	以事約而理周，蓋是至人之善巧也。	以事約而理周，蓋是至人之善巧也。	The matter is concise yet the principle is complete. This is indeed the skillful means of the utmost person.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a23_1']	又示多寶因果願行皆悉益物，明塔現謂果益物，舉本願謂因利緣。	又示多寶因果願行皆悉益物，明塔現謂果益物，舉本願謂因利緣。	Moreover, it shows that Prabhūtaratna's causes, effects, vows, and practices all benefit beings. The appearance of the stūpa is said to benefit beings through its effects, and mentioning the original vow is said to benefit conditions through its causes.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a24_1']	又涌塔讚嘆謂行益物，稱於本願謂願利緣。	又涌塔讚嘆謂行益物，稱於本願謂願利緣。	Moreover, the practices of the emergence of the stūpa and praise are said to benefit beings, and calling it the original vow is said to benefit conditions through the vow.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a26_13']	又多寶塔涌現則古佛降莚，以本願故化身雲集，時會奉覩則起奇特心，尊敬《法華》廣植諸善，有斯大益故稱本願也。	又多寶塔涌現則古佛降莚，以本願故化身雲集，時會奉覩則起奇特心，尊敬《法華》廣植諸善，有斯大益故稱本願也。	Moreover, the emergence of Prabhūtaratna's stūpa is the descent of the ancient Buddha, and because of the original vow, the transformed bodies gather like clouds. When the assembly respectfully beholds it, they give rise to a wondrous mind and greatly plant various kinds of goodness. Because there is this great benefit, it is called the original vow.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a27_11']	答：	答：	Answer:🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0434a28_2']	初但尋《法華》，文義已顯。	初但尋《法華》，文義已顯。	At first, I only studied the Lotus Sutra, and the text and meaning were already revealed.

Devadatta, at that time, entered the path but had no faith. He only wanted to learn the supernormal powers and not seek the Buddha's path.

Now, it is clarified that the relatives and followers have a place, and the arrangement of precious objects is a metaphor for the elucidation of the Way and teachings.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440b03_1']	一者法身無始終，即是無三世義。	一者法身無始終，即是無三世義。	First, the Dharma body has no beginning or end, which is the meaning of not being in the three times.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440b03_19']	二者修因得果以為報佛，此有始無終義。	二者修因得果以為報佛，此有始無終義。	Second, the reward Buddha is obtained through cultivating causes and effects, which has the meaning of having a beginning but no end.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440b14_8']	既證法身無復生滅，故無有終。	既證法身無復生滅，故無有終。	Since one has realized the Dharma body and is no longer subject to birth and death, there is no end.

Since those in the causal stage do not know its beginning or end, it is without beginning or end. Therefore, it is the meaning of the permanence of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440b29_8']	今據報身，故有始無終。	今據報身，故有始無終。	Now, it is based on the reward body, so it has a beginning but no end.

The old meaning is simply as explained above. What is clarified now has a basis in the arising of meaning. It is precisely for the people of the two vehicles who think that Śākyamuni was born in the palace of King Śuddhodana and finally passed away under the twin trees.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c08_5']	如《大經》云「是名二乘邪曲之見」。	如《大經》云「是名二乘邪曲之見」。	As the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, This is called the crooked view of the two vehicles.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c11_5']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c12_18']	等是破始終明無始終，何故無終則長而言復倍，無始則短但云補處不知？	等是破始終明無始終，何故無終則長而言復倍，無始則短但云補處不知？	Since it is the same in destroying beginning and end to clarify no beginning and end, why is the endlessness long and said to be even greater, and the beginninglessness short, only saying that it is the stage of preparation without knowing?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c13_1']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c13_8']	斯言亦有深旨。	斯言亦有深旨。	These words also have a profound meaning.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c13_17']	二義之中正取無終。	二義之中正取無終。	Among the two meanings, the endlessness is taken as the correct one.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c14_9']	所以然者，證常有二：	所以然者，證常有二：	The reason for this is that there are two ways to realize permanence:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c15_6']	一者久證、二者始證，此二但得明常。	一者久證、二者始證，此二但得明常。	First, long-attained, second, newly-attained. These two only clarify permanence.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c16_17']	唯無終義是常，有終義非常，正取無終顯常，斥二乘無常，故言復倍。	唯無終義是常，有終義非常，正取無終顯常，斥二乘無常，故言復倍。	Only being without an end is permanence, having an end is impermanence. Correctly taking being without an end to manifest permanence, refuting the two vehicles' impermanence, thus it says doubled.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c17_11']	所以無終則長、無始則短也。	所以無終則長、無始則短也。	The reason for being without an end is long, without a beginning is short.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c18_8']	若法身無始無終，此義無長短也。	若法身無始無終，此義無長短也。	If the Dharma body is without beginning and without end, this meaning is neither long nor short.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c19_2']	但自攝嶺相傳，有二河之說：	但自攝嶺相傳，有二河之說：	But the tradition of Mount Zhe has two rivers:
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c20_4']	一者菩薩在佛性河中行，二者佛在佛河中行。	一者菩薩在佛性河中行，二者佛在佛河中行。	First, bodhisattvas practice within the river of Buddha-nature, second, Buddhas practice within the river of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c21_7']	菩薩在佛性河中行者，此欲顯三世無三世義。	菩薩在佛性河中行者，此欲顯三世無三世義。	As for bodhisattvas practicing within the river of Buddha-nature, this is to manifest the meaning of neither being in the three times nor not being in the three times.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c22_16']	所以然者，菩薩猶是無常，未免三世之法，故就三世中修行。	所以然者，菩薩猶是無常，未免三世之法，故就三世中修行。	The reason for this is that bodhisattvas are still impermanent, not yet free from the dharmas of the three times, thus they practice within the three times.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c24_5']	欲顯中道佛性非三世法，是故菩薩三世，欲顯無三世義也。	欲顯中道佛性非三世法，是故菩薩三世，欲顯無三世義也。	Desiring to manifest the middle way, the Buddha-nature is not a dharma of the three times, therefore bodhisattvas are in the three times, desiring to manifest the meaning of neither being in the three times nor not being in the three times.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c26_8']	如來已離三世法，今作三世者，此是無三世，為眾生故作三世方便，故佛河中明無三世義也。	如來已離三世法，今作三世者，此是無三世，為眾生故作三世方便，故佛河中明無三世義也。	The Tathāgata has already transcended the dharmas of the three times, yet now manifests in the three times. This is being without the three times, yet for the sake of sentient beings, manifesting the expedient of the three times. Therefore, the Buddha clarifies the meaning of being without the three times in the river.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c28_17']	今此中明三世益物者，皆是佛河中行無三世三世益物，過去則不滅而滅、現在不生而生、未來不至而至。	今此中明三世益物者，皆是佛河中行無三世三世益物，過去則不滅而滅、現在不生而生、未來不至而至。	Now, in this explanation of benefiting beings through the three times, all of this is the practice of being without the three times and benefiting beings through the three times within the Buddha's river. In the past, it is non-extinction yet extinction; in the present, it is non-arising yet arising; in the future, it is non-arrival yet arrival.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c29_9']	既不滅而滅，雖滅不滅。	既不滅而滅，雖滅不滅。	Since it is non-extinction yet extinction, although extinguished, it is not extinguished.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0440c29_19']	不生而生，雖生不起。	不生而生，雖生不起。	It is non-arising yet arising, although arising, it does not occur.

['ZH_T34_1720_009:0441a03_8']	三世無三世豈是無三世？	三世無三世豈是無三世？	The three times without the three times, how can that be without the three times?
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0441a04_5']	故非三世非無三世而三世無三世。	故非三世非無三世而三世無三世。	Therefore, it is neither the three times nor without the three times, yet it is the three times and without the three times.
['ZH_T34_1720_009:0441a06_2']	雖三世無三世而非三世無三世，所以如來之身不可思議，絕凡夫二乘境界也。	雖三世無三世而非三世無三世，所以如來之身不可思議，絕凡夫二乘境界也。	Although the three times are not the three times, the three times are not the three times, therefore the body of the Tathāgata is inconceivable, transcending the realms of ordinary beings and the two vehicles.
