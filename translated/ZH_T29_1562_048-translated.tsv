['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a02_2']	論曰：	論曰：	048	Discussion:
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a03_1']	唯見苦集所斷隨眠，力能遍行，然非一切。	唯見苦集所斷隨眠，力能遍行，然非一切。	048	Only the latent tendencies eliminated by seeing suffering and its cause have the power to universally flow, but not all of them.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a03_19']	謂唯諸見疑彼相應不共無明，非餘貪等。	謂唯諸見疑彼相應不共無明，非餘貪等。	048	That is to say, only those associated with views, doubts, and non-covetousness, and not the others such as craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a05_8']	見有七見，疑有二疑，相應無明即攝屬彼，不共有二，故成十一。	見有七見，疑有二疑，相應無明即攝屬彼，不共有二，故成十一。	048	There are seven views and two doubts, and the associated ignorance is included in them. There are two types of non-covetousness, making eleven in total.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a06_8']	如是十一，於諸界地中各能遍行自界地五部。	如是十一，於諸界地中各能遍行自界地五部。	048	These eleven are able to universally function in the various realms and stages, each with the five classes of its own realm and stage.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a07_17']	謂自界地五部法中，遍緣隨眠為因生染，是故唯此立遍行名。	謂自界地五部法中，遍緣隨眠為因生染，是故唯此立遍行名。	048	That is, in the five classes of dharmas of its own realm and stage, the latent afflictions that universally follow are causes that give rise to defilement. For this reason, only these are established as universal.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a08_10']	且約界說言，三十三是遍。	且約界說言，三十三是遍。	048	Moreover, in terms of realms, it is said that thirty-three are universal.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a08_15']	然有師說：	然有師說：	048	However, there is a teacher who says:
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a09_11']	三十三中二十七是遍，餘六應分別。	三十三中二十七是遍，餘六應分別。	048	Among the thirty-three, twenty-seven are universal, while the remaining six should be distinguished.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a11_2']	彼師於此唐設劬勞，以相應無明如所相應惑，遍非遍理不說成故。	彼師於此唐設劬勞，以相應無明如所相應惑，遍非遍理不說成故。	048	That teacher has labored in vain on this, because the associated ignorance is established as universal or non-universal according to the associated afflictions, and it is not established by itself.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a13_6']	由是此中標別數者，取自力起不共無明，非此無明見苦集所斷有非是遍，是故但言三十三是遍。	由是此中標別數者，取自力起不共無明，非此無明見苦集所斷有非是遍，是故但言三十三是遍。	048	Therefore, in this context, the specific number is taken to refer to the ignorance that arises independently, not shared in common. This ignorance is not all-pervading when it is eliminated by seeing suffering and its cause. For this reason, it is only said that thirty-three are universal.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a13_11']	此說為善。	此說為善。	048	This explanation is considered good.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a14_1']	依何義立此不共名？	依何義立此不共名？	048	In terms of what meaning is this called not shared in common?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a15_8']	如是說者，相雜名共，以非共故立不共名，即是彼此各別為義。	如是說者，相雜名共，以非共故立不共名，即是彼此各別為義。	048	Those who explain it in this way say that the common characteristic is called shared, and because it is not shared, it is called unshared. This means that each has its own separate meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a15_13']	如契經說：	如契經說：	048	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a15_18']	不共佛僧。	不共佛僧。	048	The Buddha's Sangha is not shared.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a16_7']	此顯佛僧二寶各別。	此顯佛僧二寶各別。	048	This shows that the two treasures of the Buddha and the Sangha are each separate.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a17_8']	以不共行故，名不共無明，非餘隨眠相雜行故。	以不共行故，名不共無明，非餘隨眠相雜行故。	048	Because they do not share the same practice, it is called the ignorance that is not shared. It is not because the other latent afflictions share the same practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a18_7']	或普名共，即是遍義，由非共故立不共名。	或普名共，即是遍義，由非共故立不共名。	048	Or, it is called shared because it is universal. Because it is not shared, it is called unshared.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a19_15']	此不共名顯非共有，即是不遍諸煩惱義，與諸隨眠不相應故。	此不共名顯非共有，即是不遍諸煩惱義，與諸隨眠不相應故。	048	This name not shared shows that it is not shared by all, which means that it is not universal to all afflictions, because it is not associated with the other latent afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a20_1', 'ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a21_4']	有餘師說：🔽與餘煩惱不相關涉，名為不共，即是惛重無動搖義。	有餘師說： 與餘煩惱不相關涉，名為不共，即是惛重無動搖義。	048	Other masters say:🔽It is called not shared because it is not related to the other afflictions. This means it is dull and heavy, without any agitation.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a22_3']	相應無明與餘煩惱共相應故，相有警動：	相應無明與餘煩惱共相應故，相有警動：	048	Associated ignorance is associated with the other afflictions, so its characteristics are agitated:
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a24_3']	不共無明由自力起，於諸事業皆不欲為，惛重無動搖，如珊若娑病，是故名曰不共無明。	不共無明由自力起，於諸事業皆不欲為，惛重無動搖，如珊若娑病，是故名曰不共無明。	048	Non-universal nescience arises by its own power, and in all activities it does not wish to act. It is dull and heavy and without agitation, like the disease of Sanjiao. Therefore it is called non-universal nescience.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a25_2']	何故唯於見苦集斷諸隨眠內有遍行耶？	何故唯於見苦集斷諸隨眠內有遍行耶？	048	Why are there only universal contaminants eliminated by the paths of insight into the truths of suffering and its cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a26_10']	唯此普緣諸有漏法，意樂無別、勢力堅牢，故能為因遍生五部。	唯此普緣諸有漏法，意樂無別、勢力堅牢，故能為因遍生五部。	048	Only these universally take as their objects all impure dharmas. The mode of activity and object of the view of self and the ignorance associated with it is not different, and their power is firm and strong, and therefore they can be causes that universally generate the five classes of passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a28_7']	見滅見道所斷隨眠，唯有能緣有漏一分，所緣有別、勢不堅牢，不能為因遍生五部。	見滅見道所斷隨眠，唯有能緣有漏一分，所緣有別、勢不堅牢，不能為因遍生五部。	048	The contaminants eliminated by the paths of insight into the truths of cessation and path only take as their objects a part of impure dharmas, and their mode of activity and object is different. Their power is not firm and strong, and they cannot be causes that universally generate the five classes of passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a28_19']	故唯前二部，有遍行隨眠。	故唯前二部，有遍行隨眠。	048	Therefore only the first two classes of contaminants have universal ones.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a29_4']	何緣得知？	何緣得知？	048	Why is this known?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611a29_17']	修斷染法以見所斷遍行為因。	修斷染法以見所斷遍行為因。	048	Impure dharmas eliminated by cultivation have as their cause the universal ones eliminated by the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b01_3']	如何不知？	如何不知？	048	How do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b02_2']	世間現見有我見者，由我見力外境貪增；	世間現見有我見者，由我見力外境貪增；	048	We see in the world that those who have the view of a self increase their craving for external objects by the power of the view of a self.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b02_16']	我見若無，便於外境貪微薄故。	我見若無，便於外境貪微薄故。	048	If the view of a self does not exist, craving for external objects is slight and weak.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b03_4']	又由至教，如說：	又由至教，如說：	048	Also, by means of the teachings, as it is said:
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b03_12']	云何見斷為因法？	云何見斷為因法？	048	What are the dharmas with seeing-extinction as cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b03_18']	謂諸染污法。	謂諸染污法。	048	It is said: The defiled dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b04_1']	又說：	又說：	048	Also, it is said:
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b04_9']	云何無記為因法？	云何無記為因法？	048	What are the dharmas with indeterminate as cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b04_19']	謂不善法無記有為法。	謂不善法無記有為法。	048	It is said: The unwholesome dharmas and the conditioned indeterminate dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b05_9']	由此等證，知彼為因。	由此等證，知彼為因。	048	By means of these and other proofs, it is known that they are causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b06_7']	若遍行因生修斷染，已斷未斷有何差別？	若遍行因生修斷染，已斷未斷有何差別？	048	If the pervasive causes give rise to the defilements to be eliminated by cultivation, what is the difference between those that have already been eliminated and those that have not yet been eliminated?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b07_7']	彼已斷時，修所斷染亦得現起，如未斷故。	彼已斷時，修所斷染亦得現起，如未斷故。	048	When they have already been eliminated, the defilements to be eliminated by cultivation can also manifest, just as if they had not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b09_12']	又若一切修所斷染皆用見斷為遍行因，因已斷時，修所斷染既得現起，何故聖者慢類等法必不現行？	又若一切修所斷染皆用見斷為遍行因，因已斷時，修所斷染既得現起，何故聖者慢類等法必不現行？	048	Also, if all the defilements to be eliminated by cultivation use the defilements to be eliminated by seeing as pervasive causes, when the causes have already been eliminated, the defilements to be eliminated by cultivation can manifest. Why then do the dharmas of pride and so forth of the noble ones definitely not manifest?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b12_18']	且初難言已斷未斷何差別者，甚有差別，謂未斷位於自身中能為遍因取果與果，後已斷位雖能為因不能取果，唯除先時已取果者今有與義。	且初難言已斷未斷何差別者，甚有差別，謂未斷位於自身中能為遍因取果與果，後已斷位雖能為因不能取果，唯除先時已取果者今有與義。	048	As for the first objection, namely, that if they are already eliminated, what is the difference between already eliminated and not yet eliminated? There is a great difference, because in the state of not yet eliminating them, they can act as universal causes in one’s own continuum, taking results and giving results. Later, in the state of having already eliminated them, although they can act as causes, they cannot take results, with the exception of those that have already taken results in the past. Now there is the meaning of giving.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b14_7']	又已斷位雖能為因，不障聖道於自相續，不復能引自得令生；	又已斷位雖能為因，不障聖道於自相續，不復能引自得令生；	048	Also, in the state of having already eliminated them, although they can act as causes, they do not obstruct the holy path in one’s own continuum, and they can no longer induce their own attainment to arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b14_16']	與此相違是未斷位。	與此相違是未斷位。	048	The opposite of this is the state of not yet eliminating them.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b15_15']	何故聖者慢類等法必不行者，前已說因。	何故聖者慢類等法必不行者，前已說因。	048	Why do the holy ones never perform the dharmas of pride, etc.? The reason has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b16_7']	修斷既同，寧有起不起？	修斷既同，寧有起不起？	048	If elimination through cultivation is the same, why are there those that arise and those that do not arise?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b16_18']	此難非理，因有近遠故。	此難非理，因有近遠故。	048	This objection is unreasonable, because there are proximate and distant causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b17_17']	謂修斷染有以見疑為隣近因，連續而起見疑。	謂修斷染有以見疑為隣近因，連續而起見疑。	048	That is to say, there are defilements eliminated through cultivation that have views and doubts as proximate causes, and they arise in continuity with views and doubts.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b18_6']	若斷彼，必不行。	若斷彼，必不行。	048	If they are eliminated, they must not occur.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b18_16']	與彼相違，容有起義。	與彼相違，容有起義。	048	The opposite of this may have the meaning of arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b19_13']	又非擇滅得未得殊，故有現行不現行者。	又非擇滅得未得殊，故有現行不現行者。	048	Also, because of the difference between the possession and nonpossession of the attainment of nondetermined cessation, there is the functioning and nonfunctioning of this cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b20_3']	由此所說，二過俱無。	由此所說，二過俱無。	048	Consequently, the two errors mentioned above do not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b20_12']	此遍行名為目何義？	此遍行名為目何義？	048	What is the meaning of the term universal?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b21_11']	但於一切有漏法中能周遍緣，是遍行義。	但於一切有漏法中能周遍緣，是遍行義。	048	The meaning of universal is that which is able to take as objects all impure dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b24_1']	謂上所說三十三隨眠，自界地中各能緣五部，雖有於受偏起我執，而此非唯緣自身受，以兼緣此種類法故。	謂上所說三十三隨眠，自界地中各能緣五部，雖有於受偏起我執，而此非唯緣自身受，以兼緣此種類法故。	048	The thirty-three kinds of proclivities mentioned above are able to take as objects the five classes of dharmas in their own realm and stage. Even though there is a grasping of self that occurs in a biased way with regard to feeling, still this grasping is not only with regard to ones own feelings, because it also takes as objects the dharmas of the same species as those feelings.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b25_16']	若起邪見，謂所修行妙行惡行皆空無果，此亦非唯緣自身業總撥一切業生果能。	若起邪見，謂所修行妙行惡行皆空無果，此亦非唯緣自身業總撥一切業生果能。	048	When one generates a false view that holds that good and bad actions that one has cultivated are all empty and without results, this false view is not only with regard to ones own actions, because it also takes as objects the actions of others.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b26_7']	由此准知餘遍緣義。	由此准知餘遍緣義。	048	Consequently, we know that the other proclivities that take as objects all dharmas are also universals.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b28_15']	貪等煩惱唯託見聞，所思量事方得現起，以於妻等起貪等時，緣顯非形、緣形非顯，故知貪等皆非遍緣。	貪等煩惱唯託見聞，所思量事方得現起，以於妻等起貪等時，緣顯非形、緣形非顯，故知貪等皆非遍緣。	048	The passions such as craving only appear when they are supported by views, things heard, and things pondered. When one generates craving, etc., with regard to a wife, etc., one takes as objects the visible form, etc., but not the invisible form, because one generates craving, etc., with regard to the visible form, etc., but not with regard to the invisible form. Therefore we know that craving, etc., are not universals.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611b29_13']	且據隨眠能遍緣義釋遍行義，故作是說。	且據隨眠能遍緣義釋遍行義，故作是說。	048	We explain the term as it is explained, namely, that the meaning of universal is that of being able to universally grasp all objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c02_2']	若據隨眠同聚諸法所有遍義釋遍行名，則諸隨眠具三遍義。	若據隨眠同聚諸法所有遍義釋遍行名，則諸隨眠具三遍義。	048	If we explain the term universal support as the meaning of universal in the dharmas of the same group as the propensities, then the propensities are endowed with the three meanings of universal.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c03_1', 'ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c04_1']	謂於五部遍緣隨眠，及能為因遍生染法。🔽彼相應法具二遍義，謂於三義唯闕隨眠。	謂於五部遍緣隨眠，及能為因遍生染法。 彼相應法具二遍義，謂於三義唯闕隨眠。	048	That is, they are universal supports in that they universally grasp the five part categories of dharmas, and they are universal supports in that they are able to be causes that universally generate defiled dharmas.🔽Dharmas associated with the propensities are endowed with two meanings of universal, namely, they are universal supports in that they universally grasp the five part categories of dharmas, and they are universal supports in that they are able to be causes that universally generate defiled dharmas.🔽They are not universal supports in that they are not propensities.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c04_19']	彼俱有法具一遍義，謂但為因遍生染法。	彼俱有法具一遍義，謂但為因遍生染法。	048	Dharmas that are associated with the propensities are endowed with one meaning of universal, namely, they are universal supports in that they are able to be causes that universally generate defiled dharmas.🔽They are not universal supports in that they do not universally grasp the five part categories of dharmas, and they are not universal supports in that they are not propensities.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c05_8']	故前所釋無缺減過。	故前所釋無缺減過。	048	Therefore there is no fault of incompleteness in our previous explanation.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c06_16']	雖爾，無一能遍隨眠於自體等不隨眠故，則應無有遍行隨眠。	雖爾，無一能遍隨眠於自體等不隨眠故，則應無有遍行隨眠。	048	Even though this is so, there is no single dharma that is a universal support in that it is not a propensity in regard to itself, etc. Therefore there would be no universal propensities.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c08_5']	此難不然，以於五部無礙轉故立遍行名，非頓隨眠諸有漏故。	此難不然，以於五部無礙轉故立遍行名，非頓隨眠諸有漏故。	048	This objection is not reasonable, because the name universal support is established because they evolve without obstruction in regard to the five part categories of dharmas, and not because they are propensities in regard to all impure dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c09_13']	又於自體俱有法中，由於去來彼種類法有隨眠故，遍義亦成。	又於自體俱有法中，由於去來彼種類法有隨眠故，遍義亦成。	048	Also, in regard to the self, associated dharmas, and past and future dharmas of the same species, they are propensities, and for that reason the meaning of universal is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c10_14']	何因無明修所斷者唯名自相惑，非見所斷耶？	何因無明修所斷者唯名自相惑，非見所斷耶？	048	Why is ignorance that is eliminated by cultivation called only a passion that is a specific characteristic, and not one that is eliminated by insight?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c11_13']	由此無明所緣少故，見所斷法非所緣故。	由此無明所緣少故，見所斷法非所緣故。	048	Because the objects of this ignorance are few, and because dharmas eliminated by insight are not its objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0611c12_12']	又此但隨貪等轉故，貪等唯是自相惑故。	又此但隨貪等轉故，貪等唯是自相惑故。	048	Also, it is only in accordance with craving, etc., and because craving, etc., are only passions that are specific characteristics.

It is impossible for a single moment of a contaminant to take as its object a place with latent tendencies and a place without latent tendencies, because it is not allowed that there be such a case in association.

One knows that each body is devoid of a self. If this is so, the view of a self should not be a universal, because one grasps only the aggregates that are grasped as one’s own self as a self, and not the aggregates of another that are not grasped as one’s own self.

['ZH_T29_1562_048:0615c04_9']	謂貪能總攝樂相應煩惱，瞋復能總攝苦相應煩惱，故許邪見疑二無明能緣滅道，則應滅道亦是瞋事成有漏失。	謂貪能總攝樂相應煩惱，瞋復能總攝苦相應煩惱，故許邪見疑二無明能緣滅道，則應滅道亦是瞋事成有漏失。	048	That is, craving is able generally to include the passions associated with pleasure, and hatred is able generally to include the passions associated with suffering. Therefore, if it is admitted that false views, doubt, and the two kinds of ignorance are able to take cessation and the path as objects, then cessation and the path would also be the objects of hatred and would be impure.

['ZH_T29_1562_048:0615c08_6']	謂彼深心樂著生死不樂出離，故起邪見，非謗滅道，豈即名瞋？	謂彼深心樂著生死不樂出離，故起邪見，非謗滅道，豈即名瞋？	048	Because they deeply delight in and cling to saṃsāra and do not delight in leaving it, they give rise to wrong views, not denying cessation and the path. How could they be called hatred?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0615c09_13']	彼或撥無、或謂有過，故於無漏唯不忍許，非不忍許即名為瞋。	彼或撥無、或謂有過，故於無漏唯不忍許，非不忍許即名為瞋。	048	They either deny [the existence of cessation and the path] or say they have faults, so they only do not acquiesce to the undefiled [truths of cessation and the path]. Not acquiescing is not the same as being called hatred.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0615c11_2']	如佛弟子於外道說自性士夫時方我等，亦不忍許，豈即是瞋？	如佛弟子於外道說自性士夫時方我等，亦不忍許，豈即是瞋？	048	Just as when the Buddha's disciples speak of self-nature, person, time, self, etc. of non-Buddhists, they also do not acquiesce, but how could that be hatred?
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0615c12_10']	又彼所言依總相說，貪瞋總攝一切煩惱，以邪見等緣滅道故。	又彼所言依總相說，貪瞋總攝一切煩惱，以邪見等緣滅道故。	048	Moreover, what they say is based on general characteristics, that greed and hatred comprehensively include all afflictions, because wrong views, etc. take cessation and the path as objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_048:0615c14_8']	滅道則應瞋事所攝成有漏者，理亦不然，違自意故，太過失故，不決定故，應異說故。	滅道則應瞋事所攝成有漏者，理亦不然，違自意故，太過失故，不決定故，應異說故。	048	Cessation and the path should then be included in the objects of hatred and become contaminated. This reasoning is also not correct, because it contradicts their own views, because of the fault of over-extension, because it is not definite, and because it should be explained differently.

The causes and conditions of karma and the aggregates should not be three in number, and so on. The number of such categories should be reduced.
