['ZH_T38_1780_008:0905a26_6']	唯此二意，是故《華嚴》善財童子遍遊法界諸善知識，皆云先已發菩提心，但未知云何修菩薩行。	唯此二意，是故《華嚴》善財童子遍遊法界諸善知識，皆云先已發菩提心，但未知云何修菩薩行。	008	There are only these two meanings. Therefore, in the Flower Ornament Sutra, the youth Sudhana extensively visited all the good and wise advisors in the Dharma realm, and they all said that he had already given rise to the bodhi mind, but he still did not know how to cultivate bodhisattva practices.
