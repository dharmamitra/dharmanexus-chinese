The meaning of what he says according to the capacities of the audience is difficult to fathom, and is not something that all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can know.
['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0651b23_6']	」八甚深者，一受持讀誦甚深，二修行，三果行，四增長功德心，五快妙事心，六無上，七入，八不共聲聞辟支佛所作住持甚深。	」八甚深者，一受持讀誦甚深，二修行，三果行，四增長功德心，五快妙事心，六無上，七入，八不共聲聞辟支佛所作住持甚深。	The eight kinds of profundity are: 1) the profundity of receiving and upholding, reading and reciting, 2) practice, 3) fruition practice, 4) the mind of increasing meritorious virtues, 5) the mind of delighting in wondrous matters, 6) the unsurpassed, 7) entering, and 8) the profundity of the support that is not shared by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

The correct meaning should be said to be that those destined for the ultimate extinction are not given predictions because their faculties are immature. The bodhisattvas give predictions in order to cause them to give rise to the mind of faith and understanding of the Mahāyāna;
['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653a17_3']	增上慢者根未熟故佛不與記，菩薩與記令發趣向大乘心故。	增上慢者根未熟故佛不與記，菩薩與記令發趣向大乘心故。	those who have overweening pride are not given predictions by the Buddha because their faculties are immature.

['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653a21_16']	若從二凡而歸於大即頓悟攝，未曾悟證二乘果故。	若從二凡而歸於大即頓悟攝，未曾悟證二乘果故。	If one returns to the Great Vehicle from the two ordinary vehicles, one is included in the category of suddenly enlightened, because one has never previously realized the fruit of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653a23_11']	生數猶多不名漸悟，故《涅槃經》但說聖人八萬劫等，不說異生迴心劫數。	生數猶多不名漸悟，故《涅槃經》但說聖人八萬劫等，不說異生迴心劫數。	The number of rebirths is still great and one is not called gradually enlightened. Therefore the Nirvana Sutra speaks only of holy beings and their eighty thousand kalpas, etc., and does not speak of the number of kalpas required for the conversion of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653a24_15']	二者但從曾發二心曾修二行，來歸大者皆名漸悟。	二者但從曾發二心曾修二行，來歸大者皆名漸悟。	The second sense is that all those who have previously aroused the two kinds of thought of enlightenment and have previously cultivated the two kinds of practices and then return to the Great Vehicle are called gradually enlightened.
['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653a26_2']	具彼姓故修彼行故，聞思悟解亦名為悟，何必證悟？	具彼姓故修彼行故，聞思悟解亦名為悟，何必證悟？	Because they possess the two kinds of spiritual genes and because they cultivate the two kinds of practices, and because they understand through hearing and reflection, they are also called enlightened, so how can it be said that they must realize the two kinds of enlightenment?
['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653a27_10']	況復亦有生數小者，謂已定生即此生時及一坐順決擇分等。	況復亦有生數小者，謂已定生即此生時及一坐順決擇分等。	Moreover, there are also those whose number of rebirths is small, that is, those who are definitely reborn in this life, or in the very act of being reborn, or in the state of the aids to penetration, etc.
['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653a28_11']	經據劫定但說聖人，何妨異生有生數小者？	經據劫定但說聖人，何妨異生有生數小者？	The sutra speaks only of holy beings whose number of rebirths is fixed at eighty thousand kalpas, etc., so how can it be that ordinary beings do not have a small number of rebirths?

['ZH_T34_1723_01a:0653b06_4']	雖亦可為二菩薩說，正宗唯為漸悟者說。	雖亦可為二菩薩說，正宗唯為漸悟者說。	Although it can also be said to be for the two kinds of bodhisattvas, the main point is only for those who awaken gradually.

In order to eliminate this grasping, this sūtra is spoken.

Therefore, we know that the uncontaminated causes and practices of leaving the house are rightly called the One Vehicle, freely and unattached, with nothing to rely on or seek.

The teachings have the function of unfolding the wondrous principles, the principles have the power of emerging from the waters, the practices have the characteristics of unfolding and progressing towards the fruits, and the fruits have the ability to form the real essence and become the causes.

Therefore, the flower and fruit of the benteli flower are used to illustrate the causes and fruits of the saddharma. Since the Dharma encompasses four meanings, the flower also contains four virtues.

The reason for not placing it at the end of the sūtra but placing it earlier is that in the Entrustment Chapter it is said that the transformed Buddhas should each return to their original lands. If it were placed at the end of the sūtra, then it would be said that the transformed Buddhas should each return to their original lands only after the sūtra is finished. Before they return, this land is still pure. On the day when Wonderful Sound comes, why is he warned not to give rise to the thought of inferiority in this land?

At that time, the transformed Buddhas had not yet returned to their original lands, and at that time Mañjuśrī did not pay homage to the transformed Buddhas.

Both the True Dharma and Wonderful Dharma sūtras do not have this, and the treatise also does not explain the four following the three in reverse, there is a flaw in the general path, and following the principle is not accomplished. That sūtra also places the Chapter on Dhāraṇīs after the Chapter on Spiritual Powers, contradicting the sequence of the two original sūtras and the treatise.

Since the assembly has gathered but is not yet familiar, it is necessary to present the purport to instruct and guide. The Dharma of the One Vehicle is the truth, and the two provisional teachings are briefly revealed as the expedient. Speaking of the One Truth leads them back to the right path, and revealing the two Expedients causes them to turn back to the right track. The wisdom extols the skillful and wondrous response to the superior faculties, and the words expound the spiritual power that moistens and nourishes the principle. Therefore, next is the 方便品 (Chapter on Skillful Means).

There should be the understanding, reiteration, and the授記品 (Chapter on Predictions), but since Śāriputra's unique insight cannot be left alone, the understanding, reiteration, and predictions are briefly summarized in the beginning of the 譬喻品 (Chapter on Parables).

Without understanding the explanations, there is no way for them to give rise to understanding, so there is the Parable Chapter.

They must rely on the explanations of the earnest teachings and the instructions of the respectful admonitions. Speaking of the beginning of the past karmic bonds, illuminating their minds, recounting the nirvana that they have attained is not truly extinguished, causing them to return to the treasure place and head towards the great nirvana, so next there is the Chapter on the Parable of the Artificial City.

There should be faith and understanding, and again a pure mind. It is precisely because of the three repetitions and earnest comprehension that the text is concise and does not extensively or separately produce chapters.

It will cause those of later generations to share the same standard. Praising the person and extolling the Dharma will propagate the great meaning, thus there is the Chapter on the Dharma Teachers.

Therefore, breaking small attachments and accomplishing the great way, unifying the provisional meaning and entering the true principle, faith and study are already rare, and those who return and revere are also few.

It is clear that there were already those who upheld and propagated it. There were then bodhisattvas of the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers who had long been free from injury and first vowed to proclaim it widely.
