If it is not generated, the Buddha himself should manifest traces. If he does not directly resolve and subvert the doubts of the two vehicles' fruits and the bodhisattvas with remaining bodies, and does not generate their distant faith, if he does not reveal the original ground, increase the bodhisattvas' great way of contemplating the Buddha's wisdom, and reduce the births in the realms outside the three realms,
