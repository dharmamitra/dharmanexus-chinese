['ZH_T32_1635_009:0070c14_6']	如來具三十二相在一切有情身中，如無價寶為弊垢衣之所纏覆，蘊處界衣纏覆亦然。	如來具三十二相在一切有情身中，如無價寶為弊垢衣之所纏覆，蘊處界衣纏覆亦然。	The Tathāgata, endowed with the thirty-two marks, is in the bodies of all sentient beings, like a priceless jewel wrapped in filthy rags. The aggregates, sense bases, and elements wrap and cover in the same way.
['ZH_T32_1635_009:0070c15_15']	彼貪瞋癡不實計執，此之垢染是無常法、是不堅牢、是不究竟。	彼貪瞋癡不實計執，此之垢染是無常法、是不堅牢、是不究竟。	Attachment to the unreality of greed, anger, and delusion, these defiled taints are impermanent dharmas, not solid, not ultimate.

['ZH_T32_1635_009:0070c18_7']	以外道說神我是常、我能造作、離繫自在而永不滅。	以外道說神我是常、我能造作、離繫自在而永不滅。	Because non-Buddhists say that the self is permanent, able to create, free from bondage, and eternally indestructible.

Therefore, they use skillful means to speak of the unobstructed Tathagata-garbha gate, which is free from discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1635_009:0070c24_2']	此中亦非未來現在諸菩薩摩訶薩著我所作。	此中亦非未來現在諸菩薩摩訶薩著我所作。	Here, future and present Bodhisattva-mahasattvas do not cling to what they have created.

Abiding in the non-self of dharmas, free from the characteristics of discrimination, he therefore uses various superior wisdoms, skillful means, and skillful words, sometimes speaking of the tathāgatagarbha, sometimes speaking of the non-self of dharmas, using many wonderful and skillful phrases, words, and parables to explain.
['ZH_T32_1635_009:0070c29_7']	以是緣故，外道我語不可等比如來藏語。	以是緣故，外道我語不可等比如來藏語。	For this reason, the words of the tathāgatagarbha cannot be equated with the words of the self of non-Buddhists.

['ZH_T32_1635_009:0071a04_11']	若於三解脫門意樂具足，即能速證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提果。	若於三解脫門意樂具足，即能速證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提果。	If one is endowed with the intention of the three gates of liberation, one will be able to quickly realize the fruit of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.
['ZH_T32_1635_009:0071a06_3']	以是義故，如來、應供、正等正覺所說如來藏法，與外道我語不可等比。	以是義故，如來、應供、正等正覺所說如來藏法，與外道我語不可等比。	For this reason, the teaching of the tathāgatagarbha spoken by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, cannot be equated with the words of the self of non-Buddhists.
['ZH_T32_1635_009:0071a06_8']	是故大慧！	是故大慧！	Therefore, Great Wisdom!
['ZH_T32_1635_009:0071a09_11']	為令外道離諸見執，使其當得隨順如來無我藏法，此所宣說是謂無上成就究竟之法，是謂諸菩薩空無生無二無自性法，是謂甚深之法。	為令外道離諸見執，使其當得隨順如來無我藏法，此所宣說是謂無上成就究竟之法，是謂諸菩薩空無生無二無自性法，是謂甚深之法。	In order to cause non-Buddhists to abandon all views and attachments, enabling them to accord with the Tathāgata's teaching of no-self, this teaching is called the unsurpassed, ultimately accomplished Dharma, the Dharma of emptiness, no arising, no duality, and no intrinsic nature of all bodhisattvas, the profound Dharma.
