['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c18_8']	3 三辯差別品第二之三作意別有，亦如經說心由作意引發故生，故此定應是大地法。	3 三辯差別品第二之三作意別有，亦如經說心由作意引發故生，故此定應是大地法。	Chapter 3, part 3: Distinctions in the Three Discourses, Mental Attention is Distinct, Also as the Sūtras Say, the Mind is Born by the Excitation of Mental Attention, Therefore this should be a Universal Mental Factor.

['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c19_12']	無別一法名為作意，由此別相理不成故。	無別一法名為作意，由此別相理不成故。	There is no single dharma apart from this called mental attention, because the principle of its distinct characteristics is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c21_5']	謂於所緣能作動意名作意相，若於所緣唯作動意，諸餘心所應不能緣；	謂於所緣能作動意名作意相，若於所緣唯作動意，諸餘心所應不能緣；	That is to say, the characteristic of mental attention is to be able to move the mind towards an object. If it only moves the mind towards an object, the other mental factors should not be able to cognize;
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c22_9']	若亦由斯方能緣者，理不應爾，名作意故、餘緣生故。	若亦由斯方能緣者，理不應爾，名作意故、餘緣生故。	If it is also due to this that one is able to cognize, it should not be so, because it is called mental attention and the other mental factors are born from it.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c24_2']	此難非理，諸心所法依心轉故，但動於意餘動亦成，故無心所不能緣過。	此難非理，諸心所法依心轉故，但動於意餘動亦成，故無心所不能緣過。	This objection is unreasonable, because the mental factors depend on the mind to arise. It is only by moving the mind that the other movements are also accomplished. Therefore there is no fault of the mental factors being unable to cognize.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c26_4']	又眾緣力諸法乃生，故雖餘緣生心心所，而此作意非無力用，謂此作意力能令識於餘境轉。	又眾緣力諸法乃生，故雖餘緣生心心所，而此作意非無力用，謂此作意力能令識於餘境轉。	Also, dharmas are born through the power of many conditions. Therefore, although mind and mental activities are born from other conditions, attention is not without power and function. The power of attention can cause consciousness to turn to another object.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c27_7']	若爾，一境識流轉時應無作意，是則作意非大地法。	若爾，一境識流轉時應無作意，是則作意非大地法。	If this is so, then when a stream of consciousness turns to a single object, there should be no attention, and in that case attention is not a universal.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0389c28_11']	不爾，一境識流轉時亦有作意，然於餘境此用明了。	不爾，一境識流轉時亦有作意，然於餘境此用明了。	This is not so, because even when a stream of consciousness turns to a single object, there is still attention, but its function is clear in regard to other objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a01_11']	謂於一境，剎那剎那亦由作意力方引心令起，然於餘境引發心時，作意功能明顯易了。	謂於一境，剎那剎那亦由作意力方引心令起，然於餘境引發心時，作意功能明顯易了。	That is, in regard to a single object, moment after moment, it is attention that attracts consciousness and causes it to arise, but when it attracts consciousness to other objects, the function of attention is obvious and easy to perceive.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a02_14']	豈不眾緣發生心等即名能引，何勞別計作意力為？	豈不眾緣發生心等即名能引，何勞別計作意力為？	Isn’t it the case that the many conditions that generate mind and its activities are called the attractor? What is the trouble with postulating the power of attention as an attractor?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a04_3']	此責非理，雖具生識餘和合緣，而說作意能生識故，如契經說：	此責非理，雖具生識餘和合緣，而說作意能生識故，如契經說：	This criticism is unreasonable, because even though there are other conditions that generate consciousness, it is said that attention generates consciousness, as a scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a05_2']	爾時若無能生作意正現在前，識終不起。	爾時若無能生作意正現在前，識終不起。	“At that time, if there is no present attention that can generate it, consciousness will not arise.”
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a06_5']	理亦應爾，雖多境界俱時現前，而識何因唯緣一起？	理亦應爾，雖多境界俱時現前，而識何因唯緣一起？	The principle is also like this. Even if many objects are present simultaneously, why does consciousness only arise in relation to one?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a06_14']	豈不於此生緣合故。	豈不於此生緣合故。	Isn't it because the conditions for arising are complete in this case?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a07_13']	誠如所言，此即作意生緣合者，即世尊言：	誠如所言，此即作意生緣合者，即世尊言：	It is exactly as you say. The one who combines the conditions for arising is the World-Honored One, who said:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a08_3']	作意爾時正現前義。	作意爾時正現前義。	The meaning of the present manifestation of attention.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a09_2']	所言作意，於境引心，為是前生、為是俱起？	所言作意，於境引心，為是前生、為是俱起？	Is attention that leads the mind to an object something that arises before or arises simultaneously?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a10_1']	是俱時起，非謂前生，經言作意正現前故。	是俱時起，非謂前生，經言作意正現前故。	It arises simultaneously, not before, because the sūtra says it is present.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a11_8']	正現前者，謂正起近現前自境，即正生時將入現在取自境義。	正現前者，謂正起近現前自境，即正生時將入現在取自境義。	Present means that which is about to arise and enter the present, taking its own object.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a12_7']	此中意顯由作意力引識令緣自所樂境。	此中意顯由作意力引識令緣自所樂境。	This shows that by the power of attention, consciousness is led to its own desired object.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a12_17']	勝解別有，亦如經說：	勝解別有，亦如經說：	Determination has a separate existence, as the sūtra also says:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a13_6']	心由勝解印可所緣。	心由勝解印可所緣。	The mind is determined by the seal of the object.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a14_5']	諸心起時皆能印境，故此定應是大地法。	諸心起時皆能印境，故此定應是大地法。	Since all minds that arise are able to seal the object, this should definitely be a universal mental factor.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a14_10']	然上座言：	然上座言：	However, the elder says:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a15_8']	勝解別有，理不成立，見此與智相無別故。	勝解別有，理不成立，見此與智相無別故。	The existence of a separate substance called resolve is not established, because it is seen that it has no characteristics apart from knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a17_2']	謂於所緣令心決定名勝解相，此與智相都無差別，是故定應無別勝解。	謂於所緣令心決定名勝解相，此與智相都無差別，是故定應無別勝解。	That is, the characteristic of resolve is that it makes the mind certain with regard to an object, and this is not at all different from the characteristic of knowledge. Therefore resolve must not be a separate substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a17_16']	此言非理，要有印可方決定故。	此言非理，要有印可方決定故。	This argument is not reasonable, because there must be approval before there is certainty.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a18_14']	有言勝解是決定者，於決定因說為決定。	有言勝解是決定者，於決定因說為決定。	Some say that resolve is certainty, and certainty is said to be the cause of resolve.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a19_4']	若爾，此二應不同時。	若爾，此二應不同時。	If this is so, then the two must not occur at the same time.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a19_14']	不爾，此二相隨順故。	不爾，此二相隨順故。	This is not so, because the characteristics of the two are compatible.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a21_2']	謂由簡擇隨生印可，復由印可隨生決定，不相違故同時無失。	謂由簡擇隨生印可，復由印可隨生決定，不相違故同時無失。	That is, approval arises from discernment, and certainty arises from approval. Because they are not incompatible, there is no error in their occurring at the same time.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a22_1']	若一切心皆有此二，則諸心品應皆印決。	若一切心皆有此二，則諸心品應皆印決。	If all minds have these two, then all mind and mental activities must be certain and approving.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a23_9']	此難非理，以或有時餘法所伏功能被損，雖有印決，劣難知故。	此難非理，以或有時餘法所伏功能被損，雖有印決，劣難知故。	This objection is not reasonable, because sometimes the power of one of these two is suppressed by other dharmas and is damaged, and even though there is certainty and approval, it is weak and difficult to know.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a24_16']	諸無色法就用說增，如前已辯，世尊建立貪瞋癡等行相異故。	諸無色法就用說增，如前已辯，世尊建立貪瞋癡等行相異故。	The increase of formless dharmas is explained in terms of their function, as previously explained. The World Honored One established them as different aspects of greed, anger, and delusion.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a25_16']	又別說有十無學支，故知非無別勝解體。	又別說有十無學支，故知非無別勝解體。	Moreover, it is said that there are ten aspects of no-more-learning. Therefore, we know that there is a separate essence of right resolve.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a27_1']	彼謂此中心離貪軛相續轉故，即隨縛斷，名正解脫。	彼謂此中心離貪軛相續轉故，即隨縛斷，名正解脫。	This means that in this mind, one is free from the yoke of greed and the continuity of the mind is transformed. Therefore, the bonds are severed and it is called right liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a27_6']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a28_4']	以薄伽梵於餘經中自決此義，故餘經說：	以薄伽梵於餘經中自決此義，故餘經說：	Because the Bhagavān himself has determined this meaning in other sūtras. Therefore, another sūtra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a28_13']	云何名為心善解脫？	云何名為心善解脫？	What is called the mind well liberated?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a29_7']	謂心從貪從瞋從癡離染解脫。	謂心從貪從瞋從癡離染解脫。	It means the mind is free from attachment, anger, and delusion, and is liberated from defilements.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390a29_16']	云何名為慧善解脫？	云何名為慧善解脫？	What is called wisdom well liberated?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b01_10']	謂如實知心從貪等離染解脫。	謂如實知心從貪等離染解脫。	It means to truly know that the mind is free from attachment, anger, etc., and is liberated from defilements.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b02_10']	此言非善，以無體法為無學支，理不成故。	此言非善，以無體法為無學支，理不成故。	This statement is not good, because it is unreasonable to take a dharma without essence as an aspect of no-more-learning.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b03_8']	彼無少法名隨縛斷，如何可立為無學支？	彼無少法名隨縛斷，如何可立為無學支？	There is not a single dharma called the severance of bonds. How can it be established as an aspect of no-more-learning?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b03_13']	又彼釋言：	又彼釋言：	Moreover, they explain:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b04_8']	即隨縛斷名正解脫，此不成釋。	即隨縛斷名正解脫，此不成釋。	It is said that liberation is rightly liberated because the bonds are severed. This explanation is not correct.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b04_13']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it not correct?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b06_1']	由隨縛斷解脫生故，離染無為名隨縛斷，無學勝解名正解脫。	由隨縛斷解脫生故，離染無為名隨縛斷，無學勝解名正解脫。	Because liberation is born from the severance of the bonds. The severance of the bonds is called the unconditioned liberation from defilements. The superior resolve of the adepts is called rightly liberated.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b07_5', 'ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b08_4']	若不爾者，前離染言已顯縛斷，後解脫言應成無用。🔽言如實知心解脫者，見離染心相應解脫。	若不爾者，前離染言已顯縛斷，後解脫言應成無用。 言如實知心解脫者，見離染心相應解脫。	If it were not so, the previous statement about being liberated from defilements would already have shown the severance of the bonds. The subsequent statement about liberation would be useless.🔽As for the statement that one knows the mind is liberated as it really is, it means the liberation associated with the mind liberated from defilements.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b09_3']	又如實知解脫心者，謂見解脫相應之心。	又如實知解脫心者，謂見解脫相應之心。	Moreover, as for the statement that one knows the liberated mind, it means the mind associated with liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b09_12']	故餘契經世尊自說：	故餘契經世尊自說：	Therefore, in another sutra, the World-Honored One himself said:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b10_2']	心離染故便得解脫。	心離染故便得解脫。	Because the mind is liberated from defilements, it attains liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b11_6']	若不爾者，解脫既是離染異名，應依初說，不依第五。	若不爾者，解脫既是離染異名，應依初說，不依第五。	If it were not so, since liberation is a synonym for being liberated from defilements, it should rely on the first [statement] and not on the fifth.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b11_11']	如餘處言：	如餘處言：	As stated in another place:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b11_16']	盡離滅等。	盡離滅等。	Extinction, separation, cessation, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b13_14']	雖依初說離染解脫而體各異，若不爾者，說解脫言應成無用，如無染離染義無差別故。	雖依初說離染解脫而體各異，若不爾者，說解脫言應成無用，如無染離染義無差別故。	Although the first explanation is in terms of detachment and liberation, the two are different in substance. If this were not so, the word liberation would be useless, because there would be no difference between the meanings of nondefilement and detachment.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b16_4']	又說解脫為對治故，非隨縛斷即是解脫，故契經說折伏法中，言由正解脫折伏邪解脫，非隨縛斷能為對治。	又說解脫為對治故，非隨縛斷即是解脫，故契經說折伏法中，言由正解脫折伏邪解脫，非隨縛斷能為對治。	Also, it is said that liberation is an antidote, and the mere severance of bonds is not liberation. Therefore a scripture says, in the chapter on the subjugation of dharmas, that by means of true liberation one subjugates false liberation, and that the severance of bonds is not an antidote.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b17_3']	若能印可是勝解相，此與信欲應無差別。	若能印可是勝解相，此與信欲應無差別。	If the characteristic of resolve is the ability to confirm, then it would be no different from faith and desire.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b18_11']	相雖少同而體甚異，謂審印可是勝解相，心淨希求是信欲相。	相雖少同而體甚異，謂審印可是勝解相，心淨希求是信欲相。	Although the characteristics are slightly the same, the substances are quite different. That is, the characteristic of resolve is the ability to confirm, while the characteristics of faith and desire are the purity of mind and the longing for something.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b19_5']	豈不信順及與欲樂即印可耶？	豈不信順及與欲樂即印可耶？	Isn’t it that faith, compliance, and desire for pleasure are themselves confirmation?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b20_8']	信順欲樂隨順印可，非即印可，信欲助成勝解用故。	信順欲樂隨順印可，非即印可，信欲助成勝解用故。	Faith, compliance, and desire for pleasure are in accord with confirmation, but they are not themselves confirmation, because faith and desire assist the function of resolve.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b22_7']	心所相用極難辯析，唯審叡覺能分別知，故譬喻師不能堪忍分析勞倦遂總非撥。	心所相用極難辯析，唯審叡覺能分別知，故譬喻師不能堪忍分析勞倦遂總非撥。	The characteristics and functions of mental activities are extremely difficult to discern. Only those with precise and profound understanding can distinguish and know them. Therefore, the Vaibhāṣikas, unable to bear the analysis and fatigue, finally deny them altogether.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b22_19']	三摩地別有，亦如契經說：	三摩地別有，亦如契經說：	Samādhi is a separate dharma, as the scriptures say:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b23_12']	平等持心令住自境名三摩地。	平等持心令住自境名三摩地。	Holding the mind in equipoise and causing it to abide in its own object is called samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b24_16']	諸心起時無不各住自所取境，故此定應是大地法。	諸心起時無不各住自所取境，故此定應是大地法。	When various minds arise, none does not abide in its own grasped object. Therefore, this samādhi should be a universal mental dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b25_2']	然上座言：	然上座言：	However, the Sthavira says:
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b26_5']	離心無別三摩地體，由即心體緣境生時不流散故。	離心無別三摩地體，由即心體緣境生時不流散故。	Apart from mind, there is no separate substance of samādhi. When the mind itself arises taking an object, it does not flow and scatter.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b27_14']	若三摩地持心令住一境轉者，豈由三摩地無故心便於多境轉耶？	若三摩地持心令住一境轉者，豈由三摩地無故心便於多境轉耶？	If samādhi causes the mind to abide in one object and transform, would the mind then transform in many objects due to the absence of samādhi?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390b29_17']	若謂多心由此持故令於一境無間轉者，則不應說剎那剎那有三摩地，心唯一念墮在境中。	若謂多心由此持故令於一境無間轉者，則不應說剎那剎那有三摩地，心唯一念墮在境中。	If it is said that many minds are caused by this holding to transform and abide in one object without interval, then it should not be said that in each moment there is samādhi, because the mind is only a single thought that falls into the object.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c01_12']	此應非有，如是此應非大地法。	此應非有，如是此應非大地法。	This should not exist, and in the same way, this should not be a universal mental dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c03_1']	若由有此心住所緣，是則此體應非現見，然諸心所體可現見。	若由有此心住所緣，是則此體應非現見，然諸心所體可現見。	If the mind is made to abide on an object by this mental activity, then this mental activity should not be directly perceived, but mental activities are directly perceived.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c04_1']	又法功能不待餘法，故心住境自力非餘。	又法功能不待餘法，故心住境自力非餘。	Also, the power of dharmas does not depend on other dharmas, and therefore the mind abides on an object by its own power and not by that of another.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c05_10']	此言非理，令心造作亦應無別大地法思，差別因緣不可得故。	此言非理，令心造作亦應無別大地法思，差別因緣不可得故。	This argument is unreasonable, because the same would hold for the mental activity of volition, a universal mental activity, because the causes of its distinctions cannot be found.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c06_11']	又識非住所緣為性，慧等亦同，心有定非定故。	又識非住所緣為性，慧等亦同，心有定非定故。	Also, consciousness is not by nature that which causes the mind to abide on an object, nor is discernment, etc., because the mind sometimes has these activities and sometimes does not.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c07_6']	又諸心所體現見言，如前已破。	又諸心所體現見言，如前已破。	Also, the claim that the substance of mental activities is directly perceived has already been refuted.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c07_11']	前如何破？	前如何破？	How was it refuted?
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c08_8']	謂若心所現可見者，應無有執彼即是心。	謂若心所現可見者，應無有執彼即是心。	If mental activities are directly perceived, then you should not claim that they are identical with mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c09_7']	又法功能必待餘法，或應緣起言成無義。	又法功能必待餘法，或應緣起言成無義。	Also, the power of dharmas must depend on other dharmas, and therefore the words of the Mahāyānasaṃgraha are meaningless.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c10_6']	又心所用不應在心，心心所法性各別故。	又心所用不應在心，心心所法性各別故。	Also, the function of mental activities should not be in the mind, because the natures of mind and mental activities are different.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c11_5']	三摩地用謂能住心，了別所緣是識功用。	三摩地用謂能住心，了別所緣是識功用。	The function of samādhi is to cause the mind to abide, and the function of consciousness is to discern the object.
['ZH_T29_1562_011:0390c12_4']	如自體起必託所緣，亦非自能住境不散。	如自體起必託所緣，亦非自能住境不散。	Just as when the self-natures arise, they must rely on objects, they also cannot abide in objects by themselves without distraction.
