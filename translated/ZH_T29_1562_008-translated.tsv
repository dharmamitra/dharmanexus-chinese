['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371b28_8']	8 八辯本事品第一之八已說三根取非至境。	8 八辯本事品第一之八已說三根取非至境。	Chapter 1, Section 8: The Eight Eloquences, Part 1. It has been said that the three faculties take imperceptible objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371b29_7']	餘三鼻等與上相違，謂鼻舌身唯取至境。	餘三鼻等與上相違，謂鼻舌身唯取至境。	The remaining three, nose, etc., are the opposite of the above, meaning that the nose, tongue, and body only take perceptible objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371b29_16']	如何知鼻唯取至香？	如何知鼻唯取至香？	How do we know that the nose only takes perceptible smells?

['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c01_8']	斷息時則不嗅香故。	斷息時則不嗅香故。	Because when breathing is cut off, one does not smell fragrances.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c01_17']	此因於義未足證成。	此因於義未足證成。	This reason is not sufficient to prove the meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c02_16']	設有息時能嗅香氣，何能證鼻唯取至香？	設有息時能嗅香氣，何能證鼻唯取至香？	Even if there is breathing and one can smell fragrances, how can it be proven that the nose only takes perceptible smells?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c03_6']	以諸極微不相觸故。	以諸極微不相觸故。	Because the most subtle atoms do not touch each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c03_11']	何不相觸？	何不相觸？	Why do they not touch?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c04_10']	若諸極微遍體相觸，即有實物體相雜過；	若諸極微遍體相觸，即有實物體相雜過；	If the most subtle atoms touch each other with their entire bodies, then there is the fault of real things interpenetrating;
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c04_20']	若觸一分，成有分失。	若觸一分，成有分失。	if they touch a part, they lose their status of having no parts.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c05_17']	是故此因，於鼻唯取至根香義未足證成。	是故此因，於鼻唯取至根香義未足證成。	Therefore, this reason is not sufficient to prove the meaning that the nose only takes perceptible smells.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c06_17']	實有息時能取香氣，然不相觸，至義豈成？	實有息時能取香氣，然不相觸，至義豈成？	When breath actually exists, it can grasp odors, but they do not touch each other. How can it be said that the nose consciousness arises from the union of the three?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c07_7']	彼難既然，此因何解？	彼難既然，此因何解？	If this is the case, how do you interpret the reason for the existence of the three?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c08_5']	今觀至義，謂境與根隣近而生方能取故。	今觀至義，謂境與根隣近而生方能取故。	We reply, we consider the meaning of union to mean that the sense consciousness arises in proximity to the object and the sense organ.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c09_12']	由此道理，說鼻舌身唯取至境，如言眼瞼籌等至色眼不能見。	由此道理，說鼻舌身唯取至境，如言眼瞼籌等至色眼不能見。	On the basis of this principle, we say that the nose, tongue, and body consciousnesses grasp only objects that come in contact with their organs, just as the eye consciousness cannot see the eyelids or a piece of wood that comes in contact with the eye.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c11_2']	非眼瞼等要觸眼根方得名至，但眼瞼等隣近根生即名為至。	非眼瞼等要觸眼根方得名至，但眼瞼等隣近根生即名為至。	The eyelids and so on do not have to touch the eye in order to be considered to come in contact with it; they are considered to come in contact with it when they are in proximity to the organ.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c12_1']	由不能見如是至色，故說眼根取非至境。	由不能見如是至色，故說眼根取非至境。	Since the eye consciousness cannot see the eyelids and so on, we say that the eye consciousness grasps objects that do not come in contact with its organ.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c12_19']	如眼等根取非至境，然不能取極遠境界。	如眼等根取非至境，然不能取極遠境界。	Just as the sense organs such as the eyes grasp objects that do not come in contact with them, but they cannot grasp objects that are too far away.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c14_16']	鼻等亦然，雖取至境，而不能取極近境界，但由香等隣近根生，故說三根取至無過。	鼻等亦然，雖取至境，而不能取極近境界，但由香等隣近根生，故說三根取至無過。	The nose and so on are the same. Even though they grasp objects that come in contact with them, they cannot grasp objects that are too close. Since odors and so on are in proximity to the organ and arise with it, we say that the three organs grasp objects that come in contact with them.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c15_15']	非鼻香等根境極微展轉相觸，非所觸故。	非鼻香等根境極微展轉相觸，非所觸故。	The sense organs and objects are not in contact with each other, because they are not tangible objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c16_10']	又是障礙有對性故，觸即有失。	又是障礙有對性故，觸即有失。	Moreover, if it is the nature of obstruction, then contact would be a mistake.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c16_20']	為顯此義，復應研究。	為顯此義，復應研究。	In order to clarify this meaning, we should further investigate.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c17_4']	設有難言：	設有難言：	If someone raises an objection, saying:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c18_3']	若諸極微互不相觸，如何拊擊得發音聲？	若諸極微互不相觸，如何拊擊得發音聲？	If the ultimate atoms do not touch each other, how can sound be produced by striking them?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c19_2']	今此豈同鵂鶹子等，要由合德方乃生聲？	今此豈同鵂鶹子等，要由合德方乃生聲？	How is this the same as the owl's chicks, which must be born by the union of virtues to produce sound?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c19_7']	而為此難。	而為此難。	This is the objection.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c20_5']	然物合時理不成故，不應許有合德生聲。	然物合時理不成故，不應許有合德生聲。	But when things combine, the principle is not established, so the sound produced by the union of virtues should not be allowed to exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c20_15']	若爾，云何得有聲發？	若爾，云何得有聲發？	If so, how can sound be produced?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c23_11']	於此真實聖教理中，離合擊名唯依大種，謂有殊勝二四大種，離合生時得彼名故，此位大種是聲生因，此俱生聲是耳根境。	於此真實聖教理中，離合擊名唯依大種，謂有殊勝二四大種，離合生時得彼名故，此位大種是聲生因，此俱生聲是耳根境。	In this true teaching of the sages, the name of striking by combination and separation only depends on the great elements. It is said that there are two superior great elements that are born by separation and combination, and obtain that name because of this state. The great elements are the cause of the production of sound, and the sound produced together with them is the object of the ear faculty.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c23_16']	此有何失？	此有何失？	What fault is there in this?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c24_6']	彼不忍受，我不忍受。	彼不忍受，我不忍受。	They do not accept it, and I do not accept it either.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c25_10']	亦有因緣，謂諸極微既不相觸，彼此大種合義豈成？	亦有因緣，謂諸極微既不相觸，彼此大種合義豈成？	There is a reason for this, namely, that if the atoms do not touch each other, how can there be a combination of the primary elements of this and that?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c26_8']	隣近生時即名為合，豈待相觸方得合名？	隣近生時即名為合，豈待相觸方得合名？	When they are born in close proximity, they are called combined. How can it be that they must touch each other in order to be called combined?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c27_7']	又汝不應躊躇此義，此彼大種定不相觸。	又汝不應躊躇此義，此彼大種定不相觸。	Moreover, you should not hesitate over this matter, for the primary elements of this and that are definitely not in contact with each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c27_12']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c28_2']	是所觸故，非能觸故。	是所觸故，非能觸故。	Because they are the object of touch, not the agent of touching.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0371c29_14']	諸色蘊中，唯有觸界名為所觸，但有身根名為能觸，此外觸義更不應思。	諸色蘊中，唯有觸界名為所觸，但有身根名為能觸，此外觸義更不應思。	Among the aggregates of form, only the element of touch is called the object of touch, and only the body faculty is called the agent of touching. Apart from this, the meaning of object of touch should not be further considered.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a02_4']	若謂所觸亦能觸者，應許身根亦是所觸，則境有境便應雜亂。	若謂所觸亦能觸者，應許身根亦是所觸，則境有境便應雜亂。	If it is said that the object of touch can also touch, then it should be admitted that the body faculty is also the object of touch. Then the object and the object-possessor would be confused.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a02_14']	然無雜亂，立境有境。	然無雜亂，立境有境。	However, there is no confusion in positing the object and the object-possessor.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a04_2']	若謂此二無雜亂失，身識所緣所依別故，豈不由此轉成雜亂？	若謂此二無雜亂失，身識所緣所依別故，豈不由此轉成雜亂？	If it is said that there is no error of confusion between these two, because the object of the body consciousness and its support are different, how can this not lead to confusion?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a05_1']	謂若身根亦所觸者，何緣不作身識所緣？	謂若身根亦所觸者，何緣不作身識所緣？	That is to say, if the body faculty is also the object of touch, why does it not become the object of the body consciousness?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a05_19']	若許觸界亦能觸者，何緣不作身識所依？	若許觸界亦能觸者，何緣不作身識所依？	If you admit that the element of tangibility can also be touched, why does it not serve as the basis for the body consciousness?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a06_19', 'ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a07_16']	若諸極微定不相觸，《毘婆沙論》則不應言：🔽非觸為因生於是觸，謂離散物正和合時；	若諸極微定不相觸，《毘婆沙論》則不應言： 非觸為因生於是觸，謂離散物正和合時；	If the ultimate atoms definitely do not touch each other, then the Vibhāṣā should not say:🔽The tangibles that are not causes of tangibles arise, that is, when things that are separated are just coming together.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a08_15']	是觸為因生於非觸，謂和合物正離散時；	是觸為因生於非觸，謂和合物正離散時；	The tangibles that are causes of tangibles that are not causes of tangibles arise, that is, when things that are together are just separating.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a09_14']	是觸為因生於是觸，謂和合物復和合時；	是觸為因生於是觸，謂和合物復和合時；	The tangibles that are causes of tangibles arise, that is, when things that are together come together again.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a10_13']	非觸為因生於非觸，謂向遊塵同類相續。	非觸為因生於非觸，謂向遊塵同類相續。	The tangibles that are not causes of tangibles arise, that is, when the moving dust of the directions continues in the same category.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a13_14']	毘婆沙宗決定不許極微展轉更相觸義，應知彼言有別意趣，且向遊塵多極微集，而彼論說非觸為因生於非觸，故知彼言定有別意。	毘婆沙宗決定不許極微展轉更相觸義，應知彼言有別意趣，且向遊塵多極微集，而彼論說非觸為因生於非觸，故知彼言定有別意。	The Vibhāṣā school definitely does not admit the meaning of the ultimate atoms mutually touching each other. You should know that their words have a special intention. Moreover, the moving dust of the directions is a collection of many ultimate atoms. Therefore, the Vibhāṣā says that the tangibles that are not causes of tangibles arise. Therefore, you should know that their words definitely have a special intention.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a13_19']	有何別意？	有何別意？	What is the special intention?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a14_8']	謂於和合說是觸言。	謂於和合說是觸言。	It means that when they are combined, they are called tangibles.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a14_17']	毘婆沙師咸作是說：	毘婆沙師咸作是說：	The Vibhāṣā masters all say:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a15_16']	但由風界力所攝持，令諸極微和合不散。	但由風界力所攝持，令諸極微和合不散。	But it is only by the power of the wind element that it holds together the most subtle particles, preventing them from dispersing.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a17_5']	眾緣合故聚色生時，說非觸因生於是觸，即離散因生聚集義。	眾緣合故聚色生時，說非觸因生於是觸，即離散因生聚集義。	When aggregated form arises due to the convergence of conditions, it is said that non-contact arises from contact as a cause, which means the arising of aggregation from the cause of dispersion.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a18_12']	豈不無有不集極微待緣方集，則應一切是觸為因生於是觸。	豈不無有不集極微待緣方集，則應一切是觸為因生於是觸。	Isn't it the case that there are most subtle particles that do not aggregate, but only aggregate when conditions are present? Then it would follow that all of them arise from contact as a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a18_17']	有作是說：	有作是說：	There is an explanation:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a19_12']	亦有極微不聚集者，故無此失。	亦有極微不聚集者，故無此失。	There are also most subtle particles that do not aggregate, so this error does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a19_15']	有說：	有說：	There is another explanation:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a20_11']	待麁和合色故，於細和合立非觸名。	待麁和合色故，於細和合立非觸名。	Because it depends on coarse aggregated form, subtle aggregation is given the name non-contact.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a21_19']	故非觸因生是觸者，是細聚因生麁聚義，故彼所言於義無失。	故非觸因生是觸者，是細聚因生麁聚義，故彼所言於義無失。	Therefore, when it is said that non-contact arises from contact as a cause, it means that coarse aggregation arises from subtle aggregation as a cause. Thus, what they say is not erroneous in meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a24_6']	眾緣合故攝持聚色，風界滅時與此相違，離散色起，即於此位說是觸因生於非觸，是麁聚因生細聚義。	眾緣合故攝持聚色，風界滅時與此相違，離散色起，即於此位說是觸因生於非觸，是麁聚因生細聚義。	When aggregated form is held together due to the convergence of conditions, when the wind element ceases, it is contrary to this, and dispersed form arises. At this stage, it is said that non-contact arises from contact as a cause, which means that subtle aggregation arises from coarse aggregation as a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a26_14']	眾緣合故攝持聚色，風界不滅諸麁色聚，或生自類、或轉生麁，說是觸因生於是觸，是麁聚因生麁聚義。	眾緣合故攝持聚色，風界不滅諸麁色聚，或生自類、或轉生麁，說是觸因生於是觸，是麁聚因生麁聚義。	When the various conditions come together, they hold and gather the color, and the wind element does not destroy the coarse color aggregate, either producing its own kind or transforming into the coarse. This is said to be the cause of contact producing contact, meaning the cause of the coarse aggregate producing the coarse aggregate.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a29_5']	由此道理，諸向遊塵能攝持麁，風界不起，細聚相續不轉成麁，名非觸因生於非觸，是細聚因生細聚義。	由此道理，諸向遊塵能攝持麁，風界不起，細聚相續不轉成麁，名非觸因生於非觸，是細聚因生細聚義。	By this principle, the moving dust particles towards can hold the coarse, and the wind element does not arise. The continuity of the subtle aggregate does not transform into the coarse, called the cause of non-contact producing non-contact, meaning the cause of the subtle aggregate producing the subtle aggregate.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372a29_14']	此謂彼言所有別意。	此謂彼言所有別意。	This is the separate meaning of the word that in the text.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b01_9']	又於非色亦說觸言，如契經說：	又於非色亦說觸言，如契經說：	Moreover, contact is also spoken of in relation to what is not form, as a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b01_19']	出滅定時，當觸幾觸？	出滅定時，當觸幾觸？	When emerging from the concentration of cessation, how many contacts does one touch?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b04_10']	當觸三觸，謂不動觸、無所有觸及無相觸，然非此中可計實有互相觸義，是故所言此彼大種定不相觸，其理極成。	當觸三觸，謂不動觸、無所有觸及無相觸，然非此中可計實有互相觸義，是故所言此彼大種定不相觸，其理極成。	One touches three contacts, namely the contact of imperturbability, the contact of nothingness, and the contact of signlessness. However, in this case, one cannot calculate that there is a real meaning of mutual contact. Therefore, the principle that those primary elements definitely do not contact each other is extremely established.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b05_1']	若許相觸，復有何過？	若許相觸，復有何過？	If one allows contact, what further fault is there?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b06_4']	豈不前說，若諸極微遍體相觸，即有實物體相雜過；	豈不前說，若諸極微遍體相觸，即有實物體相雜過；	Didn't we say earlier that if the entire substance of the most subtle atoms touches each other, then there is the fault of the real substance interpenetrating;
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b06_14']	若觸一分，成有分失。	若觸一分，成有分失。	if they touch a part, then there is the fault of having parts?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b07_3']	然彼上座於此復言：	然彼上座於此復言：	However, the Sthavira says this again:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b07_12']	諸極微體即是方分。	諸極微體即是方分。	The substance of the most subtle atoms is precisely the spatial division.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b08_2']	如何有體，言無方分？	如何有體，言無方分？	How can something that has a substance be said to be without spatial division?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b10_5']	此言非理，若許極微更無細分，有自體故是方分者，諸無色法既有自體，無差別故應是方分。	此言非理，若許極微更無細分，有自體故是方分者，諸無色法既有自體，無差別故應是方分。	This statement is unreasonable. If it is accepted that the most subtle atoms have no finer divisions, and because they have their own substance they are spatially divided, then the formless dharmas, since they have their own substance and are without distinction, should be spatially divided.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b12_3']	若謂無色無和合義是故不應名方分者，此亦非理，諸無色法有處亦說有和合故。	若謂無色無和合義是故不應名方分者，此亦非理，諸無色法有處亦說有和合故。	If it is said that the formless dharmas are without the meaning of combination and therefore should not be called spatially divided, this is also unreasonable, because it is said that the formless dharmas also have a location.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b13_11']	又彼所宗色有和合，亦不應理，應成一故，不應一體可名和合。	又彼所宗色有和合，亦不應理，應成一故，不應一體可名和合。	Moreover, the position that form has combination is also unreasonable, because it should become one. It is not reasonable for a single substance to be called a combination.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b13_16']	又上座說：	又上座說：	Moreover, the Sthavira says:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b14_9']	二類極微俱無分故住處無別。	二類極微俱無分故住處無別。	The two kinds of most subtle atoms are both without parts, and therefore their locations are not separate.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b15_1']	此亦非理，彼論自言：	此亦非理，彼論自言：	This is also unreasonable, because that treatise itself says:
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b15_10']	有說極微處不相障。	有說極微處不相障。	Some say that atoms do not obstruct each other in space.

Why do they say that the two kinds of atoms are both partless, and that they do not occupy different places?
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b19_1']	又彼所言，即由此故許依同處說不相離，又言極少許五極微同在一處不相妨礙。	又彼所言，即由此故許依同處說不相離，又言極少許五極微同在一處不相妨礙。	Also, they say that for this very reason, it is admitted that they are said to be non-separated in the same place, and they also say that the smallest amount of five atoms are in the same place without obstructing each other.
['ZH_T29_1562_008:0372b19_6']	此皆非理。	此皆非理。	This is all unreasonable.
