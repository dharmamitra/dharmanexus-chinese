['ZH_T35_1733_014:0358c14_3']	從前三乘差別之位進入一乘，是故來也。	從前三乘差別之位進入一乘，是故來也。	From the stages of the distinctions of the previous Three Vehicles, one enters the One Vehicle. Therefore, it appears.

['ZH_T35_1733_014:0358c19_8']	《唯識》云「無相中作加行障，謂所知障中俱生一分令無相觀不任運起。	《唯識》云「無相中作加行障，謂所知障中俱生一分令無相觀不任運起。	The Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi says, The hindrance of making effort in the absence of characteristics, that is, a part of the obstacle to that which is to be known that is innate, causes the contemplation of the absence of characteristics not to arise spontaneously.

In the sixth ground, contemplation with characteristics is slight, while contemplation without characteristics is predominant. In the seventh ground, pure contemplation without characteristics always continues, but there is still effort. Because there is effort in the absence of characteristics, one is still unable to spontaneously manifest characteristics and lands. Such effort is a hindrance to the effortless path in the eighth ground.

Because they are eliminated forever, one attains two kinds of mastery, and therefore the eighth stage is said to eliminate two delusions and their coarseness.
['ZH_T35_1733_014:0358c26_10']	一於無相作功用愚、二於相自在愚。	一於無相作功用愚、二於相自在愚。	The first is the delusion of making effort with regard to the imageless, and the second is the delusion of mastery over images.

The subtle obstacle to that which is to be known in the seventh consciousness can still appear, because the knowledge of the emptiness of beings and its results do not contradict it.🔽The Cheng weishi lun says, The obstacle to that which is to be known is of two kinds. The first is innate and the second is added. The innate kind is subtle and is eliminated only by the path of cultivation. The added kind is coarse and is eliminated during the path of insight.

['ZH_T35_1733_014:0359a03_6']	由所斷障，令作加行，故說名加行障。	由所斷障，令作加行，故說名加行障。	Because the obstacle that is eliminated causes added effort to be made, it is said to be an obstacle to added effort.
['ZH_T35_1733_014:0359a04_16']	由此第七有加行故，雖現金等諸相及土，非任運現，故以為障。	由此第七有加行故，雖現金等諸相及土，非任運現，故以為障。	Because of this, the seventh consciousness has added effort, and even though it manifests images of gold, etc., and lands, it does not do so spontaneously, and therefore it is an obstacle.
['ZH_T35_1733_014:0359a05_16']	生空智果者，謂生空智所引後得智及滅定。	生空智果者，謂生空智所引後得智及滅定。	The fruition of the wisdom of emptiness of self is the subsequently attained wisdom and the concentration of cessation induced by the wisdom of emptiness of self.
