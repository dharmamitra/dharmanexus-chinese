['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804b26_16']	所以名為住者，欲明菩薩既道登初地，現見真如法無我理，永斷四住習氣及無明麁品，出二十五有分段生死、離五怖畏。	所以名為住者，欲明菩薩既道登初地，現見真如法無我理，永斷四住習氣及無明麁品，出二十五有分段生死、離五怖畏。	002	The reason it is called abiding is to clarify that when a bodhisattva has ascended to the first ground, directly perceives the principle of the non-self of suchness, permanently severs the habitual tendencies of the four abodes and the coarse aspects of ignorance, emerges from the saṃsāra of the twenty-five existences, and is free from the five fears,
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804b29_12']	爾時過凡夫地、入菩薩位，生在佛家，種性尊貴無可譏嫌，具足廣等四種深心，畢竟利益一切眾生，則能決定安住菩薩初地。	爾時過凡夫地、入菩薩位，生在佛家，種性尊貴無可譏嫌，具足廣等四種深心，畢竟利益一切眾生，則能決定安住菩薩初地。	002	at that time, he transcends the stage of ordinary beings and enters the stage of bodhisattvas. He is born in the Buddha's family, with a noble lineage that is beyond reproach. He is fully endowed with the four kinds of profound minds, such as vastness, and ultimately benefits all sentient beings. He is then able to decisively abide in the first ground of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c01_5']	所言住者，以不住道解為住。	所言住者，以不住道解為住。	002	What is meant by abiding is that the understanding of the path of non-abiding is taken as abiding.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c01_10']	云何不住？	云何不住？	002	How is it non-abiding?
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c02_9']	謂觀有為虛偽、斷生死因盡，故不住世間。	謂觀有為虛偽、斷生死因盡，故不住世間。	002	It means observing conditioned phenomena as false and deceptive, severing the causes of birth and death, and thus not dwelling in the world.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c03_12']	現見真如平等，得大慈悲願力成就，故不住涅槃。	現見真如平等，得大慈悲願力成就，故不住涅槃。	002	Directly seeing the equality of suchness, attaining the power of great compassion and vows, and thus not dwelling in nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c04_4', 'ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c08_1']	以此不住為住，故云住也。🔽所以復名我心者，明初地菩薩既證聖位，現見真如平等之理，由會此理，解知我之所有真如佛性無為法身、眾生所有真如佛性無為法身亦復如是，一體平等無二無差別。	以此不住為住，故云住也。 所以復名我心者，明初地菩薩既證聖位，現見真如平等之理，由會此理，解知我之所有真如佛性無為法身、眾生所有真如佛性無為法身亦復如是，一體平等無二無差別。	002	Using this non-dwelling as dwelling, therefore it is called dwelling.🔽The reason it is also called the mind of self is to clarify that the bodhisattva of the first ground, having already realized the holy stage, directly sees the principle of the equality of suchness. Due to realizing this principle, he understands that the suchness buddha-nature unconditioned dharma body that he possesses is also like this, and the suchness buddha-nature unconditioned dharma body that sentient beings possess is also like this, with a single essence, equal and non-dual, without distinctions.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c11_10']	於此理中，不自見我是菩薩修行之人有真如法身、彼是眾生不修行者無真如法身，解知一切眾生即是我身，然凡聖雖異而真如平等，故云我心亦得。	於此理中，不自見我是菩薩修行之人有真如法身、彼是眾生不修行者無真如法身，解知一切眾生即是我身，然凡聖雖異而真如平等，故云我心亦得。	002	Within this principle, he does not see himself as a bodhisattva who practices and has the suchness dharma body, and others as sentient beings who do not practice and do not have the suchness dharma body. He understands that all sentient beings are none other than his own body. Although ordinary beings and sages differ, suchness is equal. Therefore it is said that the mind of self is also attained.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c11_13']	云何？	云何？	002	What is it?
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c13_4']	一體悲心成就，彼此無二，故曰我心，此以解真如自在我為我心故。	一體悲心成就，彼此無二，故曰我心，此以解真如自在我為我心故。	002	The first is the accomplishment of the mind of compassion, which is non-dual, therefore called the mind of self, because it understands the self-mastery of suchness as the mind of self.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c13_22']	《十地經》云「於一切眾生起我心」也。	《十地經》云「於一切眾生起我心」也。	002	The Daśabhūmika-sūtra says to give rise to the mind of self in all sentient beings.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c18_5']	此住分經文所以來者，上第二段中既明如來善護念地前二種菩薩，與其智力令證初地，然上既明地前相似無漏能入之行，未出證地之行，是故第三次正辨入初地已上真如無漏行也。	此住分經文所以來者，上第二段中既明如來善護念地前二種菩薩，與其智力令證初地，然上既明地前相似無漏能入之行，未出證地之行，是故第三次正辨入初地已上真如無漏行也。	002	The reason for the coming of this chapter on abiding is that in the second section above, it has already been clarified that the Tathāgata skillfully protects and thinks of the two kinds of bodhisattvas below the grounds, and bestows the power of wisdom to enable them to realize the first ground. However, since it has already been clarified that the practice of entering [the grounds] through the similar-to-leakage [stage] below the grounds has not yet emerged from the practice of realizing the grounds, therefore, the third [section] next correctly distinguishes the practice of suchness with leakage above the first ground.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c18_7']	問：	問：	002	Question:
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c20_3']	菩薩爾時以何等心、觀何境界、修何等行、證何等法而得住於初地大乘法中？	菩薩爾時以何等心、觀何境界、修何等行、證何等法而得住於初地大乘法中？	002	At that time, with what kind of mind does the bodhisattva contemplate what kind of realm, cultivate what kind of practice, realize what kind of dharma, and thus abide in the Mahayana dharma of the first ground?
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c20_13']	住初地時有何相貌也？	住初地時有何相貌也？	002	What are the characteristics of abiding in the first ground?
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c23_1']	明菩薩爾時僧祇行滿，具足四種深心、六度行成，現見真如證無生法忍，過凡夫地入菩薩位，生在佛家。	明菩薩爾時僧祇行滿，具足四種深心、六度行成，現見真如證無生法忍，過凡夫地入菩薩位，生在佛家。	002	At that time, the bodhisattva's practices of the asaṃkhyeya eon are fulfilled, and the four kinds of profound mind and the practice of the six pāramitās are perfected. Directly seeing suchness, one realizes the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas, surpassing the stage of ordinary beings and entering the stage of bodhisattvas, being born in the Buddha's family.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0804c24_3']	有如是心行相貌則得住於初地，名為大力菩薩。	有如是心行相貌則得住於初地，名為大力菩薩。	002	Having such a mind and characteristics, one can abide in the first ground, called the bodhisattva of great power.

It clarifies that the bodhisattvas of the ten grounds ride the six pāramitās to reach the ultimate fruit, thus it is called the Great Vehicle in the cause.

What he praises and asks will accord with the sage's mind, being true and not false, not mistaken speech. Therefore, the Tathāgata praises him with excellent.

It is not that in the path of wisdom that illuminates the conventional truth of dependent arising, there are also no sentient beings to be liberated, and therefore these two statements are not contradictory.

Because the merit is fulfilled, it explains the third line: how can these four kinds of mind abide in the Mahayana of the first ground? It clarifies that because the four kinds of merit are fulfilled, one can abide in the Mahayana of the first ground.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0807b04_16']	「是故四種深利益攝取心生」等者，結總釋四心也。	「是故四種深利益攝取心生」等者，結總釋四心也。	002	Therefore, the four kinds of profound benefiting and embracing mind arise and so forth concludes the general explanation of the four minds.

One must continue to cultivate myriad practices, increase the practice of the path of seeing, perfect the various virtues, and pass through two more great eons of practice before one can progress and realize the fruit of Buddhahood.

['ZH_T25_1512_002:0808b15_2']	若無心者，此何異欝單越人，彼處人無我所心，他來取物者劫無心悋惜。	若無心者，此何異欝單越人，彼處人無我所心，他來取物者劫無心悋惜。	002	If there is no mind, how is this different from the people of Uttarakuru? The people there have no sense of ownership, and when others come to take their things, they do not begrudge it.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0808b15_15']	以無施心故，雖捨布施無福。	以無施心故，雖捨布施無福。	002	Because there is no mind of giving, even though one abandons giving, there is no merit.

This clarifies that there is a mind, it is not mindless.
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0808b23_2']	若取相布施，是有漏因，但感三界有為果報，其福有盡故少。	若取相布施，是有漏因，但感三界有為果報，其福有盡故少。	002	If one practices giving with characteristics, it is a cause of contamination, only giving rise to conditioned results in the three realms, and its merit is exhausted, therefore it is small.

Therefore, the merit of signlessness is even more immeasurable and inconceivable.

How can it be said that practicing giving without dwelling on appearances attains merit as vast as space?
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0808c21_19']	故佛答「但應如是行於布施」，明雖為佛菩提而行布施，然佛答菩提無為、法身非有為相故，為無為佛菩提行於布施，非取相也。	故佛答「但應如是行於布施」，明雖為佛菩提而行布施，然佛答菩提無為、法身非有為相故，為無為佛菩提行於布施，非取相也。	002	Therefore, the Buddha answers, One should only practice giving in this way. It clarifies that although one practices giving for the sake of Buddhahood, the Buddha answers that Buddhahood is unconditioned and the Dharma body is not characterized by conditioned phenomena, so practicing giving for the sake of the unconditioned Buddhahood is not taking on appearances.

Why is it that in this sūtra, it only clarifies the pāramitā of giving and does not speak of the other five?
['ZH_T25_1512_002:0809a03_15']	若有此疑，還應有問，以此經多不作問答故，論主隨順經意亦不作問答，故宜答言「檀義攝於六」。	若有此疑，還應有問，以此經多不作問答故，論主隨順經意亦不作問答，故宜答言「檀義攝於六」。	002	If there were this doubt, there should be a question. Since this sutra often does not have questions and answers, the author of the treatise also does not make questions and answers in accordance with the meaning of the sutra.
