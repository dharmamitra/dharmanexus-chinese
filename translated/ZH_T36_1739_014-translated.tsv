['ZH_T36_1739_014:0808c01_2']	二釋品名目者，於此佛號中，約有五緣以成佛號：	二釋品名目者，於此佛號中，約有五緣以成佛號：	014	Second, explaining the chapter title, within this Buddha's name, there are five conditions for forming the Buddha's name:

['ZH_T36_1739_014:0808c14_6']	二約如來示成正覺自德緣以成佛號者，即十方諸佛示成正覺，共同十號，所謂如來、應供、正遍知是。	二約如來示成正覺自德緣以成佛號者，即十方諸佛示成正覺，共同十號，所謂如來、應供、正遍知是。	014	Second, using the virtue of the Tathāgata's own realization of perfect enlightenment to establish the name of Buddhahood, it refers to the buddhas of the ten directions demonstrating perfect enlightenment, sharing the same ten epithets, namely the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, and the Perfectly Enlightened One.

They all establish the name as a buddha based on the benefits attained.
['ZH_T36_1739_014:0808c27_7']	十迴向中，以十箇妙佛上名悉同號之為妙，為明十迴向位中菩薩進修漸熟妙智現前故，佛號為妙。	十迴向中，以十箇妙佛上名悉同號之為妙，為明十迴向位中菩薩進修漸熟妙智現前故，佛號為妙。	014	In the ten grounds, the ten buddhas above are all named Sublime to clarify that in the ten grounds, the bodhisattva's gradual cultivation becomes mature and sublime wisdom manifests, so the buddhas are called Sublime.

They are all based on the dharmas obtained by the practitioner to form the buddha's name.

That is, using the body that appears in response to the sentient beings' realm, being a Buddha, a celestial being, a spirit, a lord, a benevolent one, or an immortal.
['ZH_T36_1739_014:0809a14_3']	遍眾生界，令諸眾生不作惡者，總是不可以自凡情所測也，總是佛名號遍周。	遍眾生界，令諸眾生不作惡者，總是不可以自凡情所測也，總是佛名號遍周。	014	Pervading the realm of sentient beings, causing sentient beings to not do evil, in general, this cannot be measured by one's own ordinary emotions. All of this is the pervasive presence of the Buddha's names and titles.

['ZH_T36_1739_014:0809a19_9']	一切法自體性離即法界性，法界性即佛號故，一切法及名言皆是佛號故，為如來稱此一切法自性離之法以成佛故。	一切法自體性離即法界性，法界性即佛號故，一切法及名言皆是佛號故，為如來稱此一切法自性離之法以成佛故。	014	The inherent emptiness of all dharmas is the nature of the Dharma realm, and the nature of the Dharma realm is the Buddha's title. Therefore, all dharmas and names and words are the Buddha's title. For this reason, the Tathāgata is called the Buddha because he realizes the Dharma of the inherent emptiness of all dharmas.
