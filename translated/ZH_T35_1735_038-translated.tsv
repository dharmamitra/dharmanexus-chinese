Bodhisattvas exhaustively illuminate without exception. The different teachings according to wisdom are difficult to fathom. Briefly mentioning ten illuminations is inexhaustible. However, the ten are all the bodhisattvas' own wisdom. The characteristics of wisdom are difficult to clarify, so the treatise clarifies their differences based on benefiting beings. This is generally called the purity of wisdom within the known dharmas.

That is, the first is the contemplation of the characteristics of the four truths, the second is the contemplation of their emptiness of nature, the third is the common contemplation of the unobstructed nature and characteristics, the fourth is the contemplation of the distinctness of nature and characteristics, and the fifth is the contemplation of the integration of these four into dependent arising.

That is, the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth contemplations are the contemplations of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path, respectively. The last one only contemplates cessation and the path, because it is the cause for realizing the Buddha's wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_038:0797a25_10']	遠公後五亦通觀四諦，謂迷於四諦故為苦集，悟其四諦故成滅道，後一窮四諦緣起實性清淨法界成大乘道。	遠公後五亦通觀四諦，謂迷於四諦故為苦集，悟其四諦故成滅道，後一窮四諦緣起實性清淨法界成大乘道。	038	Master Yuan says that the last five also commonly contemplate the four truths. That is, because of delusion regarding the four truths, they become suffering and accumulation. Because of realization of the four truths, they become cessation and the path. The last one exhausts the true nature of the dependent arising of the four truths, and the pure Dharma realm becomes the path of the Great Vehicle.
