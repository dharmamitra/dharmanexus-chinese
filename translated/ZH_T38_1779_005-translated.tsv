['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a09_3']	「別圓福智顯出佛性」者，福智即緣了也，緣了約修位位橫具。	「別圓福智顯出佛性」者，福智即緣了也，緣了約修位位橫具。	The merit and wisdom of the Distinct and Perfect teachings reveal the Buddha-nature refers to the conditions and realization of merit and wisdom. The conditions and realization are horizontally complete in each stage of cultivation.

['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a11_15']	此由智三覺本有三，復由福三助智嚴本。	此由智三覺本有三，復由福三助智嚴本。	This is because the three wisdoms originally have three, and the three merits further assist the wisdom to adorn the basis.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a13_3']	故至初住，修性一合無復分張，三德分顯，故名顯出佛性也。	故至初住，修性一合無復分張，三德分顯，故名顯出佛性也。	Therefore, upon reaching the initial stage of abiding, the cultivation and nature become one and are no longer divided. The three virtues are partially revealed, and thus it is called the manifestation of the Buddha-nature.

['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a17_5']	藏通一往亦可立緣了名以收福智，名教區別前二定無。	藏通一往亦可立緣了名以收福智，名教區別前二定無。	The hidden and revealed teachings provisionally establish the names of conditions and understanding in order to include blessings and wisdom. The distinctions in names and teachings are not found in the first two teachings.

Even upon reaching fruition, it still exists.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a19_14']	別圓二教以顯為生，異藏通故，其名別立。	別圓二教以顯為生，異藏通故，其名別立。	The separate and perfect teachings use manifestation as arising, which is different from the hidden and revealed teachings. Therefore, their names are established separately.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a20_15']	余謂荊溪言「對諸法」者，即指別列一十二科。	余謂荊溪言「對諸法」者，即指別列一十二科。	I say that Jinxu's words in terms of all dharmas refer to the twelve categories listed separately.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a21_5']	緣了即指今文總舉福智。	緣了即指今文總舉福智。	Conditions and understanding refer to the general mention of blessings and wisdom in this text.

The first four all receive their names only after the stage of clear understanding.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a27_7']	然今從圓故，故五通因。	然今從圓故，故五通因。	However, now it is from the perfect, therefore the five are common to the causes.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a28_5']	教既列四，圓義不局，故後結之修五者也。	教既列四，圓義不局，故後結之修五者也。	Since the teaching lists four, the meaning of perfection is not limited, therefore it is concluded later as the cultivation of the five.

['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768a29_6']	用此五身復生法身五身，即是因五身也。	用此五身復生法身五身，即是因五身也。	Using these five bodies to further give rise to the five bodies of the Dharma body, the five bodies are precisely the causal five bodies.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b02_4']	通教五分，初之二分云如前者，罪不罪等皆依前教五分為境，故後後教悉觀前前。	通教五分，初之二分云如前者，罪不罪等皆依前教五分為境，故後後教悉觀前前。	As for the five parts of the Shared Teaching, the first two parts are said to be the same as before. The offenses and non-offenses, etc., are all based on the five parts of the previous teaching as the objects. Therefore, the later teachings all contemplate the previous ones.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b02_19']	若一音異解，秖於一五所見各別。	若一音異解，秖於一五所見各別。	If there is one sound with different understandings, then in just one of the five, what is seen is different.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b04_3']	通教中云見真圓極者，此非圓融之圓，以極稱圓耳。	通教中云見真圓極者，此非圓融之圓，以極稱圓耳。	In the Shared Teaching, it is said that seeing the true and ultimate is not the ultimate of perfect interfusion, but is called ultimate only because it is the extreme.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b05_16']	「九種戒」等者，《地持》六度一一皆九，名同義別，故今用彼三九之文而為三分。	「九種戒」等者，《地持》六度一一皆九，名同義別，故今用彼三九之文而為三分。	As for the nine kinds of precepts, etc., in the Bodhisattva Stages, each of the six perfections has nine, with the same names but different meanings. Therefore, the three sections of the text now use the three nines of the previous text.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b06_13']	「了了知見法身顯」等者，自唯見理也。	「了了知見法身顯」等者，自唯見理也。	As for clearly knowing and seeing the Dharma body manifesting, etc., this is only seeing the principle by oneself.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b07_6']	通因果迷悟諸位，位有隱顯。	通因果迷悟諸位，位有隱顯。	The stages of cause and effect, delusion and enlightenment, in the Shared Teaching, the stages have hidden and manifest aspects.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b08_17']	圓教云一往與別無殊者，意云同至常住極果故也，圓修境智因果大異。	圓教云一往與別無殊者，意云同至常住極果故也，圓修境智因果大異。	As for the Perfect Teaching, it is said that it is initially no different from the Distinct Teaching, the meaning is that they are the same in reaching the ultimate fruit of abiding forever. However, the cultivation of objects, cognition, cause, and effect in the Perfect Teaching are greatly different.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b10_8']	然別教三皆云九種者，通指地前乃至等覺，證道且同，故云無殊。	然別教三皆云九種者，通指地前乃至等覺，證道且同，故云無殊。	However, the three in the Distinct Teaching are all said to be nine kinds, generally referring to those below the grounds up to the stage of equal enlightenment. The path of realization is the same, so it is said there is no difference.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b10_20']	「欲分別」去，更辨別也。	「欲分別」去，更辨別也。	If you want to distinguish... and below further distinguishes the Distinct Teaching.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b12_6']	「以前三教無有一時修五因義事等」等者，以事況理，故云事等。	「以前三教無有一時修五因義事等」等者，以事況理，故云事等。	Because the previous three teachings do not have the meaning of simultaneously cultivating the five causes, etc., etc., using events to illustrate principle, therefore it says events are the same.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b13_7']	即法身之大在煩惱之小，小大常爾，無所相妨。	即法身之大在煩惱之小，小大常爾，無所相妨。	The great of the Dharma body is in the small of afflictions. Small and great are always so, without obstructing each other.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b14_5']	況至果時大恒在小，故能事用芥等須彌。	況至果時大恒在小，故能事用芥等須彌。	How much more so when reaching the fruition stage, the great always exists in the small, therefore it can use events such as mustard seeds to contain Mount Sumeru.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b15_17']	故不斷言秖指凡鄙一念剎那具足難思法身之見，本來相在非關事通。	故不斷言秖指凡鄙一念剎那具足難思法身之見，本來相在非關事通。	Therefore, the words not cut off only point to the view of the inconceivable Dharma body fully contained in a single thought-moment of ordinary and base beings, originally mutually present, not related to events or penetration.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b18_14']	是故方便教內之人迷於相在不思議理，縱聞常住解惑分流，故使權人由教未實，若至登地勝用無殊，故教道中仍存異解。	是故方便教內之人迷於相在不思議理，縱聞常住解惑分流，故使權人由教未實，若至登地勝用無殊，故教道中仍存異解。	Therefore, the people within the expedient teachings are confused about the inconceivable principle of mutual presence. Even if they hear about eternal abiding, understanding and delusion flow separately. Therefore, it causes those of provisional status, due to the teaching not being real, if they reach the grounds, their superior function is no different. Therefore, within the teaching path, they still harbor different understandings.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b19_15']	故唯圓教始末一如，故使五分法身不乖凡質。	故唯圓教始末一如，故使五分法身不乖凡質。	Therefore, only the perfect teaching, from beginning to end, is one suchness, causing the five parts of the Dharma body not to contradict the ordinary substance.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b21_17']	「慧行緣理名慧身」者，因修之相，戒定是助，故且云事中慧具足偏門諸慧，故以圓慧而為正道。	「慧行緣理名慧身」者，因修之相，戒定是助，故且云事中慧具足偏門諸慧，故以圓慧而為正道。	The practice of wisdom taking principle as the name of the wisdom body is the appearance of the cause of cultivation. Precepts and concentration are aids, so it is said that the wisdom of the biased gate of the fulfillment of affairs is the wisdom of the perfect wisdom, which is the right path.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b22_17']	以正消助，無處不融，以具正助合行故也。	以正消助，無處不融，以具正助合行故也。	Using the right to dissolve the aids, there is no place that is not fused, because it is equipped with the right and the aids combined.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b23_1']	二、四等。	二、四等。	Second, the four equalities.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b23_20']	然此四等皆應約三，謂生緣、法緣、無緣。	然此四等皆應約三，謂生緣、法緣、無緣。	However, these four equalities should all be discussed in terms of three: giving rise to conditions, giving rise to the Dharma, and giving rise to no conditions.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b24_23']	而《大經》、《大論》皆從慈說，以慈望三，義準可知。	而《大經》、《大論》皆從慈說，以慈望三，義準可知。	The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra and the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra both speak from compassion, and the meaning of compassion in comparison to the three can be known by analogy.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b25_19']	今此四教通以生緣為境，藏通至二、別圓具三。	今此四教通以生緣為境，藏通至二、別圓具三。	Now, these four teachings all take giving rise to conditions as the object. The Tripiṭaka and Shared [Teachings] reach two, while the Distinct and Perfect [Teachings] are equipped with all three.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b27_1']	又雖俱觀生而境有廣狹，藏通觀六、別圓觀十。	又雖俱觀生而境有廣狹，藏通觀六、別圓觀十。	Moreover, although they both contemplate giving rise to conditions, the objects have broad and narrow [scopes]. The Tripiṭaka and Shared [Teachings] contemplate six, while the Distinct and Perfect [Teachings] contemplate ten.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b28_2']	藏通以空亡境但至法緣，別圓觀中俱修無緣。	藏通以空亡境但至法緣，別圓觀中俱修無緣。	In the Tripitaka and Shared Teachings, emptiness eliminates objects and only reaches the contemplation of dharmas. In the Distinct and Perfect Teachings, both contemplate without objects.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768b29_10']	故《大經》云「慈之所緣，一切眾生如父母妻子親屬，是名眾生緣。	故《大經》云「慈之所緣，一切眾生如父母妻子親屬，是名眾生緣。	Therefore the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: The objects of kindness are all sentient beings, like parents, spouses, children, and relatives. This is called the contemplation of sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c01_4']	見一切法皆從緣生，是名法緣。	見一切法皆從緣生，是名法緣。	Seeing that all dharmas arise from conditions is called the contemplation of dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c01_18']	不住法相及眾生相，是名無緣。	不住法相及眾生相，是名無緣。	Not abiding in the characteristics of dharmas or sentient beings is called the contemplation without objects.

['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c03_1']	下文例爾。	下文例爾。	The following passages are similar.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c03_19']	其中藏人雖不斷惑，修無常觀亦屬法緣。	其中藏人雖不斷惑，修無常觀亦屬法緣。	Among them, although the practitioners of the Tripitaka Teaching do not eliminate delusions, their cultivation of the contemplation of impermanence also belongs to the contemplation of dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c05_7']	別圓二教雖皆具三，別教無緣初地方得，不同圓教初心具三。	別圓二教雖皆具三，別教無緣初地方得，不同圓教初心具三。	Although both the Distinct and Perfect Teachings are all endowed with the three, in the Distinct Teaching, the contemplation without objects is only attained at the stage of the ten grounds. It is different from the Perfect Teaching, where the three are complete from the initial arousal of the intention for enlightenment.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c07_1']	故《大經》云「慈若有無非有非無，如是之慈非諸聲聞辟支佛等所能思議。	故《大經》云「慈若有無非有非無，如是之慈非諸聲聞辟支佛等所能思議。	Therefore the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: If kindness exists, it is not existent; if it does not exist, it is not nonexistent. Such kindness cannot be conceived by the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and others.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c07_13']	」此即三慈一體圓人所修。	」此即三慈一體圓人所修。	This is the three kinds of compassion that are cultivated by the person of perfect interfusion of the three.

['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c12_1']	應知皆以眾生緣慈而為觀境，是故向來一一教中皆云法緣，所以藏通唯至法緣，別教後心方得無緣，圓教初心即修三慈。	應知皆以眾生緣慈而為觀境，是故向來一一教中皆云法緣，所以藏通唯至法緣，別教後心方得無緣，圓教初心即修三慈。	It should be known that all take the compassion of sentient beings as the object of contemplation. Therefore, in each teaching above, it says compassion for dharmas. Therefore, the Tripiṭaka and Shared teachings only reach compassion for dharmas, the Distinct teaching's final stage of mind only attains compassion without discrimination, and the Perfect teaching's initial stage of mind immediately cultivates the three kinds of compassion.
['ZH_T38_1779_005:0768c13_18']	「慶喜亡懷」者，由用慈悲見他離苦得樂，故起喜心不望恩報，即是捨心，故云亡懷也。	「慶喜亡懷」者，由用慈悲見他離苦得樂，故起喜心不望恩報，即是捨心，故云亡懷也。	Rejoicing and forgetting one's feelings means that by using compassion and sympathy to see others free from suffering and attain happiness, one gives rise to a joyful mind and does not expect a reward for kindness, which is the mind of equanimity, therefore it is said forgetting one's feelings.

When habits have not yet been exhausted, although one may see the five supernormal powers, they are only yielding to the fruits. In reality, one has already attained the uncontaminated supernormal powers, and therefore they arise from the six causes and give rise to the six fruits.

Among the six supernormal powers, using the supernormal power of knowing past lives to see the suffering of past lives and give rise to great disgust, using the supernormal power of the heavenly eye to know the suffering of future lives and give rise to great disgust, and using the supernormal power of the extinction of contamination to be able to contemplate correctly and cut off afflictions in the present.
