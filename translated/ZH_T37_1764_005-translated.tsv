The heavens have many meanings, which will be explained below. Now, the meaning of purity is taken. Because it is the practice of the pure heavens, it is called the practice of the heavens. In foreign countries, there are many names. Purifying oneself is called purity, and purifying others is called Brahma. In this land, the name is less, and it is generally called purity.

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b04_8']	《地持》宣說空無相願、滅盡正受以為聖住，聖住猶是聖行義矣，空無相願猶是惠行，滅盡正受猶是定行。	《地持》宣說空無相願、滅盡正受以為聖住，聖住猶是聖行義矣，空無相願猶是惠行，滅盡正受猶是定行。	005	The *Saṃgītiparyāya explains emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and the attainment of cessation as holy abodes. Holy abodes are still the meaning of holy practices. Emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness are still the practices of wisdom. The attainment of cessation is still the practice of concentration.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b05_16']	具論梵行門亦無量，今此經中說七善法、四無量心以為梵行；	具論梵行門亦無量，今此經中說七善法、四無量心以為梵行；	005	If fully discussed, the gate of pure conduct is also immeasurable. In this sūtra, it explains the seven good dharmas and the four immeasurable minds as pure conduct;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b07_1']	《地持》唯說四無量心以為梵住，彼中梵住猶此梵行。	《地持》唯說四無量心以為梵住，彼中梵住猶此梵行。	005	The *Saṃgītiparyāya only explains the four immeasurable minds as the brahma abodes. There, the brahma abodes are still the same as the pure conduct here.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b07_18']	天行一種，此中不說，指《雜華經》；	天行一種，此中不說，指《雜華經》；	005	One kind of heavenly conduct is not explained here, but it points to the *Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b08_17']	《地持論》中宣說八禪以為天住，彼中天住猶此天行。	《地持論》中宣說八禪以為天住，彼中天住猶此天行。	005	In the *Saṃgītiparyāya-śāstra, it explains the eight dhyānas as heavenly abodes. There, the heavenly abodes are still the same as the heavenly conduct here.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b09_16']	懺悔前罪是其病行，不起後過是嬰兒行。	懺悔前罪是其病行，不起後過是嬰兒行。	005	Repenting of past offenses is the practice of illness, not giving rise to later transgressions is the practice of an infant.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b11_1']	五中，前三明攝善法，後二離過，一一廣釋，備如後文。	五中，前三明攝善法，後二離過，一一廣釋，備如後文。	005	Among the five, the first three clarify the wholesome dharmas that are embraced, and the latter two are the avoidance of faults. The extensive explanations of each are all as in the following text.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b11_12']	「當修是五」結勸修習。	「當修是五」結勸修習。	005	One should cultivate these five concludes by exhorting practice.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b13_7']	上來五種正明行體，復有一行謂如來行，辨行所依，謂依如來先成之德修習趣入。	上來五種正明行體，復有一行謂如來行，辨行所依，謂依如來先成之德修習趣入。	005	The above five kinds correctly clarify the essence of practice. There is also one practice, namely the Tathāgata's practice, which distinguishes the basis of practice. It means cultivating and entering based on the virtues accomplished by the Tathāgata in the past.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b15_10']	亦可五行是其教行，顯性成行是如來行，顯如來性以成行故，所修五行依彼以成，故須辨之。	亦可五行是其教行，顯性成行是如來行，顯如來性以成行故，所修五行依彼以成，故須辨之。	005	It can also be said that the five practices are the teaching practice. Manifesting the nature and accomplishing practice is the Tathāgata's practice. Because it manifests the Tathāgata's nature and accomplishes practice, the five practices that are cultivated are accomplished based on that, and therefore it is necessary to distinguish them.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b18_2']	准下惠中嘆經似爾，謂《涅槃經》就詮指實，實德難彰故寄詮顯，如下文中諸行之後嘆經勝者，當知顯此如來行也。	准下惠中嘆經似爾，謂《涅槃經》就詮指實，實德難彰故寄詮顯，如下文中諸行之後嘆經勝者，當知顯此如來行也。	005	According to the praise of the sūtra in the wisdom section below, it seems to be so. That is to say, the Nirvana Sutra points to the truth in terms of what it expounds. The virtues of truth are difficult to manifest, so it relies on what is expounded to be revealed. As in the text below, after the various practices, those who praise the superiority of the sūtra should know that this manifests the Tathāgata's practice.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b18_7']	此初段竟。	此初段竟。	005	This first section is finished.

The chapter on pure practices teaches cultivating pure practices. The chapter on the infant teaches the practices of an infant. The practice of the heavens is profoundly indicated in the Miscellaneous Flowers. The practice of illness is not discussed at all.

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b23_6']	彼是聲聞、緣覺病行，何關菩薩？	彼是聲聞、緣覺病行，何關菩薩？	005	That is the practice of illness of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, how is it related to bodhisattvas?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b24_14']	又前所論雜病之行，今此所教治病之行，與前大別，何得指前？	又前所論雜病之行，今此所教治病之行，與前大別，何得指前？	005	Moreover, the miscellaneous practices of illness discussed previously and the practice of curing illness taught here are greatly different from the previous, how can it refer to the previous?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b25_12']	又前品中未標五行，以何義故豫說病行？	又前品中未標五行，以何義故豫說病行？	005	Moreover, the five practices were not yet designated in the previous chapter, for what meaning did it preemptively discuss the practice of illness?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729b25_17']	判無斯理。	判無斯理。	005	Judging it, there is no such principle.

Therefore, in the text below, King Ajātaśatru killing his father is a mental illness, and the worsening of his physical wounds is a physical illness. The Buddha emits compassionate light to treat his physical illness and preaches the wonderful Dharma to remove his mental illness. Treating these two illnesses is called the practice for illness.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c01_16']	若彼懺罪非是病行，應有所指，不應直爾。	若彼懺罪非是病行，應有所指，不應直爾。	005	If his repentance is not the practice for illness, it should refer to something, and it should not be so straightforward.

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c02_16']	若彼是病行者，何故在於〈梵行品〉說？	若彼是病行者，何故在於〈梵行品〉說？	005	If that is the practice for illness, why is it explained in the Brahmacarya Chapter?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c02_19']	釋言：	釋言：	005	The explanation says:

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c03_17']	又問：	又問：	005	Another question:
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c04_14']	若彼兼論病行，何故偏名〈梵行品〉乎？	若彼兼論病行，何故偏名〈梵行品〉乎？	005	If it also discusses the practice for illness, why is it named the Brahmacarya Chapter?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c07_18']	此例亦多，如上〈如來性品〉中具明多法，題章偏名〈如來性品〉，此亦似彼，但經立品差別種種，或有從初、或復就後、或有據中、或復當相，非可一定。	此例亦多，如上〈如來性品〉中具明多法，題章偏名〈如來性品〉，此亦似彼，但經立品差別種種，或有從初、或復就後、或有據中、或復當相，非可一定。	005	This example is also common. As explained in detail in the chapter on the nature of the Tathāgata above, many dharmas are named after the chapter title Chapter on the Nature of the Tathāgata. This is also similar to that. However, the chapters in the sūtra are distinguished in various ways, some starting from the beginning, some focusing on the end, some based on the middle, and some according to their characteristics. It cannot be determined by one fixed method.

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c08_16']	若彼是病行者，何故文中不標、不結？	若彼是病行者，何故文中不標、不結？	005	If that is the practice of illness, why is it not stated or concluded in the text?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c08_19']	釋言：	釋言：	005	The explanation says:
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c09_5']	辨義大例有二：	辨義大例有二：	005	The great examples of distinguishing meanings are of two kinds:
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c09_16']	一當法直論，須標須結；	一當法直論，須標須結；	005	First, directly discussing the dharma, it must be stated and concluded;

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c14_10']	然下文中寄人表法，寄彼世王懺悔，滅除害父之逆，以顯菩薩懺悔，滅除一切罪障以為病行，不唯將彼世王懺悔害父之逆以為菩薩一切病行，故無標結。	然下文中寄人表法，寄彼世王懺悔，滅除害父之逆，以顯菩薩懺悔，滅除一切罪障以為病行，不唯將彼世王懺悔害父之逆以為菩薩一切病行，故無標結。	005	However, in the text below, it uses people to represent the Dharma, using that worldly king's repentance to eliminate the offense of killing his father, to show the bodhisattva's repentance, eliminating all karmic hindrances as his illness practice. It is not just taking that worldly king's repentance of the offense of killing his father as the bodhisattva's entire illness practice, so there is no introduction or conclusion.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c17_10']	亦可彼文義有兩兼，懺悔滅罪是王病行，為救一切逆罪眾生兼令多人發菩提心，是王梵行，以有兩兼，是故不得偏就一義標舉以結。	亦可彼文義有兩兼，懺悔滅罪是王病行，為救一切逆罪眾生兼令多人發菩提心，是王梵行，以有兩兼，是故不得偏就一義標舉以結。	005	Alternatively, that text has two meanings: repenting and eliminating offenses is the king's illness practice, and saving all beings with offenses is the king's pure practice. Because it has two meanings, it cannot be unilaterally introduced and concluded based on a single meaning.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c18_11']	就聖行中，初戒，次定，後明智惠，義次第故。	就聖行中，初戒，次定，後明智惠，義次第故。	005	In the holy practices, first is precepts, next is concentration, and then wisdom is explained, because of the sequential order of the meaning.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0729c19_4']	戒聖行中，初問，次辨，後結。	戒聖行中，初問，次辨，後結。	005	In the holy practice of precepts, first is the question, next is the explanation, and finally the conclusion.

Therefore, I previously said that there is pleasure in the six kinds of contact and up to the pleasure of the mind experiencing good dharmas.

The lower birth and below compares the subtle to the coarse. The coarse and heavy eight sufferings in the three evil paths are the worst, so they are called lower. Kāśyapa, having heard that in the previous subtle lower suffering, one can give rise to the thought of happiness, then questions the Tathāgata, wanting to make the worst suffering in the three evil paths also give rise to happiness, so he says the lower birth and the lower old age, sickness, etc. should also give rise to happiness.

As you say below specifically describes his words.🔽As you say, pleasure does not arise in the lower and higher realms. This principle is indeed so.

Therefore, in the past, I told Mānadinna that among the five aggregates of dharmas, the aggregate of form has pleasure, which is true and not false.

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738a29_3']	一寬狹分別，小乘所觀苦、集二諦止在分段因之與果，滅、道二諦唯是分段因果對治，觀法局限，故名有量；	一寬狹分別，小乘所觀苦、集二諦止在分段因之與果，滅、道二諦唯是分段因果對治，觀法局限，故名有量；	005	First, distinguishing in terms of breadth and narrowness. The two truths of suffering and accumulation contemplated by the Lesser Vehicle are limited to the causes and effects of the segmented [realm]. The two truths of cessation and the path are only the antidotes to the causes and effects of the segmented [realm]. The contemplation of dharmas is limited, so it is called limited;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738b02_5']	大乘所觀苦、集，該於分段、變易二種因果，滅、道統收分段、變易兩種對治，觀法寬廣故名無量。	大乘所觀苦、集，該於分段、變易二種因果，滅、道統收分段、變易兩種對治，觀法寬廣故名無量。	005	The suffering and accumulation contemplated by the Great Vehicle encompass the two kinds of causes and effects of the segmented [realm] and transformation [realm]. The cessation and the path comprehensively include the two kinds of antidotes to the segmented [realm] and transformation [realm]. The contemplation of dharmas is vast, so it is called unlimited.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738b04_9']	二淺深分別，小乘法中觀諦淺近，如《毘曇》說苦者實苦，不可令樂，乃至宣說道是實道，更無餘義。	二淺深分別，小乘法中觀諦淺近，如《毘曇》說苦者實苦，不可令樂，乃至宣說道是實道，更無餘義。	005	Second, distinguishing in terms of shallowness and depth. In the Dharma of the Lesser Vehicle, the contemplation of the truths is shallow and proximate. As the Abhidharma explains, suffering is truly suffering and cannot be made into happiness, and so forth, up to proclaiming that the path is truly the path and there is no other meaning.

Speaking of revealing the true, proclaiming the extremely profound nature of the Tathagata's womb as the truth, therefore the Shengman Sutra says, In the place of the noble truths, the Tathagata's womb is spoken of. Because of this depth, it is called immeasurable.

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738b21_13']	前中總相知於世諦是名中智，隨別細故是名上智，故三法印為第一義是名中智，知彼真實如來藏中恒沙佛法無量無邊為第一義是名上智。	前中總相知於世諦是名中智，隨別細故是名上智，故三法印為第一義是名中智，知彼真實如來藏中恒沙佛法無量無邊為第一義是名上智。	005	In the first part, the general understanding of the truth of the world is called middling knowledge, and the specific and detailed understanding is called superior knowledge.

The school that refutes characteristics, which is shallow among the Mahayana, refutes the characteristics of causes and conditions of all dharmas, proclaiming that all Buddhas are ultimately empty and tranquil;

The self, sentient beings, and so forth grasped by false feelings are considered conventional truth, while the principle of no-self is considered ultimate truth.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738c19_19']	二假實分別，瓶、衣、車乘、舍宅、軍眾如是一切假名之有名為世諦，陰、界、入等實法之有為第一義，故《雜心》云「若法分別時捨名則說等世俗也，分別無所捨是名第一義」；	二假實分別，瓶、衣、車乘、舍宅、軍眾如是一切假名之有名為世諦，陰、界、入等實法之有為第一義，故《雜心》云「若法分別時捨名則說等世俗也，分別無所捨是名第一義」；	005	Second, the distinction between the provisional and the real. Things such as pots, clothes, carriages, houses, and armies, all of which are provisional names, are considered conventional truth, while the real existence of dharmas such as the aggregates, realms, and sense bases is considered ultimate truth. Therefore the Saṃyuktâbhidharmahṛdaya says: If a dharma is abandoned when its name is distinguished, then it is said to be conventional. Distinguishing without abandoning is called ultimate.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738c21_9']	三理事分別，陰界入等事有為世，四諦十六行法相道理為第一義；	三理事分別，陰界入等事有為世，四諦十六行法相道理為第一義；	005	Third, the distinction between phenomena and principles: the phenomena of the aggregates, sense bases, and sense fields are the conditioned world, while the characteristics of the four truths and sixteen aspects of the teachings are the principle of ultimate truth;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738c22_6']	四縛解分別，苦、集是世，滅道第一；	四縛解分別，苦、集是世，滅道第一；	005	Fourth, the distinction between bondage and liberation: suffering and the origination of suffering are the world, while cessation and the path are the ultimate;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738c23_17']	五有為、無為分別，苦、集及道理中非上，同為世諦，滅諦精勝說為第一；	五有為、無為分別，苦、集及道理中非上，同為世諦，滅諦精勝說為第一；	005	Fifth, the distinction between the conditioned and the unconditioned: suffering, the origination of suffering, and the principle of the path are all considered conventional truth, while the truth of cessation is considered the ultimate;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738c25_16']	六空有分別，於彼四諦十六行中除空、無我皆名世諦，空與無我理中精妙，說為第一；	六空有分別，於彼四諦十六行中除空、無我皆名世諦，空與無我理中精妙，說為第一；	005	Sixth, the distinction between emptiness and existence: within the four truths and sixteen aspects, all except for emptiness and non-self are called conventional truth, while emptiness and non-self are considered the ultimate;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0738c28_16']	七行教分別，教名世諦，行名第一，故《雜心》云「經律阿毘曇是名俗正法，三十七覺品是名第一義」，今此但彰初之三門，餘略不辨。	七行教分別，教名世諦，行名第一，故《雜心》云「經律阿毘曇是名俗正法，三十七覺品是名第一義」，今此但彰初之三門，餘略不辨。	005	Seventh, the distinction between practice and teaching: the teaching is called conventional truth, while the practice is called the ultimate. Therefore, the Saṃyuktâbhidharmahṛdaya says: The sūtras, vinaya, and abhidharma are called conventional correct Dharma, while the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are called the ultimate. Here, only the first three aspects are shown, the rest are omitted.

The combination of the five aggregates is called a certain person. Ordinary people, following what is called, have the view of self and others, which is called conventional truth.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0739a02_7']	聖人解陰無有某甲，離陰亦無，名第一義。	聖人解陰無有某甲，離陰亦無，名第一義。	005	The sages understand that the aggregates do not have a certain person, and apart from the aggregates, there is also no [self]. This is called ultimate truth.

First, explaining that the two dharmas with names and reality are the real dharmas. The aggregates, sense bases, and sense fields have names and can be sought to have substance. Since their essence can be obtained, it is said to have reality.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0739a06_5']	有名無實是其假法，瓶、衣、車乘、舍宅、軍眾如是一切假施其名，推求無體故曰無實。	有名無實是其假法，瓶、衣、車乘、舍宅、軍眾如是一切假施其名，推求無體故曰無實。	005	Having a name but no reality are the provisional dharmas. Pots, clothes, carriages, houses, armies, and all such things are provisionally given names. Investigating and seeking, they have no substance, thus it is said to be unreal.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0739a06_20']	下就辯諦，假為世諦，實為第一。	下就辯諦，假為世諦，實為第一。	005	Below, discussing the truths. The provisional is conventional truth, and the real is ultimate truth.

['ZH_T37_1764_005:0739a10_1']	事有假實，如我眾生乃至兔角、旋火輪等是其假中，諸陰界入是其實事，此等一切同名世諦；	事有假實，如我眾生乃至兔角、旋火輪等是其假中，諸陰界入是其實事，此等一切同名世諦；	005	Phenomena have false and real aspects. For example, self, sentient beings, up to rabbit horns, spinning fire wheels, etc. are false, while the aggregates, realms, and sense bases are real phenomena. All of these are called conventional truth.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0739a10_17']	苦、集、滅、道法相道理為第一義。	苦、集、滅、道法相道理為第一義。	005	The characteristics and principles of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path are the ultimate truth.

What is called accumulation cites the previous accumulation. Below, it distinguishes its characteristics. Able to cause the skandhas to arise directly reveals the meaning of accumulation. Called suffering and impermanent is a secondary discussion of the faults of accumulation. The essence of accumulation arises and ceases. Arising and ceasing intersect, so it is called suffering.

Although the meaning of cause and origination and so forth exists in suffering, it is classified within the origin. Although the meaning of impermanence and so forth exists within the origin, it is classified within suffering. In terms of the commonalities, within suffering there is also the meaning of origination. Therefore, in the twelve links of dependent origination, the arising of the fruit of suffering is later collectively called the conditions of origination. The conditions of origination are still a different name for the origin. Within the origin there is also the meaning of impermanence and so forth. Therefore, this text explains the origin as being impermanent and suffering.

Therefore, it is called the truth of suffering.🔽Within the origin, they use the meaning of cause, origination, and existence and so forth as the correct meaning, and suffering, impermanence, and so forth as the secondary meaning. Therefore, it is called the truth of origination.

All first establish the analogy and then combine it, which can be understood.

Therefore, you should not praise the Tathāgata for now turning the Dharma wheel again. Mañjuśrī previously said that turning the unsurpassed wheel is called praise. The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, have spoken in the past and present, all of which is the Dharma wheel, because it ceases evil, gives rise to good, and benefits sentient beings. One should not only praise the present as unsurpassed;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0744c21_12']	今昔所說迢然別故，不應言佛更轉法輪。	今昔所說迢然別故，不應言佛更轉法輪。	005	Therefore, it should not be said that the Buddha turns the Dharma wheel again.

From here below, Mañjuśrī clarifies the purpose of the question. He explains for himself and for others. I am not ignorant of what is meaningless clarifies his own understanding.

First, he discusses the Buddha. Because it is what the Buddha realized and what the Buddha taught, it is called the holy practice. All the World-Honored Ones peacefully abide in nirvana is the Buddha's realization. Explaining and distinguishing is the Buddha's teaching. For this reason concludes below.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0745a03_17']	下就餘辯，是聲聞等所聞所行故名聖行，「聲聞、緣覺、菩薩聞已」是其聞也，「則能奉行」是其行也，「故名」下結。	下就餘辯，是聲聞等所聞所行故名聖行，「聲聞、緣覺、菩薩聞已」是其聞也，「則能奉行」是其行也，「故名」下結。	005	Next, he discusses the rest. Because it is what the śrāvakas and others hear and practice, it is called the holy practice. The śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas hear it is their hearing. Then they are able to respectfully practice it is their practice. For this reason concludes below.

Evil karma is the root of evil reputation. Removing the root leaves nothing remaining, so it is also called the fear of mixed evil reputation. First, it lists two numbers, then two names. In the six paths, one can create karma. Humans and asuras create karma most heavily, so they are mentioned specifically. The explanation below highlights human evil. There are three lists the numbers. Slandering the sutra and committing grave offenses are listed. The five heinous crimes are not limited to humans.

Within that, first distinguishing the three based on the practice of kindness, and then classifying compassion and so forth, generally distinguishing the three conditions, which have three meanings:
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b11_1']	第一直就化益分別，如此經說，緣諸眾生欲與其樂名眾生緣，緣諸眾生所須三物而施與之是名法緣，緣如來者名曰無緣，義如經辯；	第一直就化益分別，如此經說，緣諸眾生欲與其樂名眾生緣，緣諸眾生所須三物而施與之是名法緣，緣如來者名曰無緣，義如經辯；	005	The first directly distinguishes based on the distinctions in benefiting those to be converted, as this sūtra explains. Taking sentient beings as the condition and wishing to give them happiness is called the sentient being condition. Taking sentient beings' need for the three things and giving them is called the dharma condition. Taking the Tathāgata as the condition is called the no-condition. The meaning is as explained in the sūtra;
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b14_2']	第二化益、觀入分別，前二化益，後一觀入，如《地經》說，緣諸眾生欲與其樂名眾生緣，緣其一切化眾生法名曰法緣，緣法空寂名為無緣；	第二化益、觀入分別，前二化益，後一觀入，如《地經》說，緣諸眾生欲與其樂名眾生緣，緣其一切化眾生法名曰法緣，緣法空寂名為無緣；	005	The second is the benefit of transformation and the distinction of contemplation and entry. The first two are the benefit of transformation, and the last one is contemplation and entry. As the Sutra on the Stages says, taking the desire of all sentient beings to give them happiness is called the sentient being cause, taking the Dharma of transforming all sentient beings is called the Dharma cause, and taking the emptiness and quiescence of the Dharma is called the no cause.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b17_12']	第三亦就化益、觀入以分三緣，初一化益，後二觀入，如《地持論》及此經說，緣生與樂名眾生緣，緣生無我但是因緣五陰法數名曰法緣，觀彼陰空名曰無緣。	第三亦就化益、觀入以分三緣，初一化益，後二觀入，如《地持論》及此經說，緣生與樂名眾生緣，緣生無我但是因緣五陰法數名曰法緣，觀彼陰空名曰無緣。	005	The third also divides the three causes based on the benefit of transformation and contemplation and entry. The first one is the benefit of transformation, and the last two are contemplation and entry. As the Treatise on the Stages of Concentration says and this sutra says, taking the arising of giving happiness is called the sentient being cause, taking the arising of no self is merely the Dharma of the five aggregates and the number of dharmas is called the Dharma cause, and contemplating the emptiness of those aggregates is called the no cause.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b18_15']	此等具釋，廣如別章，今此文中且依初後兩義辯釋。	此等具釋，廣如別章，今此文中且依初後兩義辯釋。	005	These are explained in detail in a separate chapter. In this text, I will now explain it based on the first and last two meanings.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b19_10']	就初義中，生緣法緣辯釋可解。	就初義中，生緣法緣辯釋可解。	005	In the first meaning, the explanation of the sentient being cause and Dharma cause can be understood.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b20_14']	就無緣中，「緣於如來是名無緣」略以標舉，下廣釋之。	就無緣中，「緣於如來是名無緣」略以標舉，下廣釋之。	005	In the no cause, taking the Tathagata as the no cause is briefly indicated, and it is explained in detail below.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b23_11']	慈者，多緣貧窮眾生，如來大師永離貧窮，受第一樂，若緣眾生則不緣佛，約眾生緣以顯無緣，眾生緣中不緣如來故曰無緣。	慈者，多緣貧窮眾生，如來大師永離貧窮，受第一樂，若緣眾生則不緣佛，約眾生緣以顯無緣，眾生緣中不緣如來故曰無緣。	005	Compassion mostly takes poor sentient beings as its object. The Great Teacher Tathāgata is forever free from poverty and receives the highest bliss. If it takes sentient beings as its object, it does not take the Buddha as its object. It is based on the sentient beings' aspect to manifest the aspect of no-object. Within the sentient beings' aspect, it does not take the Tathāgata as its object, thus it is called no-object.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b25_8']	法亦如是，約對法緣以顯無緣，法緣之時欲與眾生，不欲與佛，故曰「如是」。	法亦如是，約對法緣以顯無緣，法緣之時欲與眾生，不欲與佛，故曰「如是」。	005	The Dharma is also like this means it is based on the Dharma's aspect to manifest the aspect of no-object. When taking the Dharma as its object, it wishes to give to sentient beings, but does not wish to give to the Buddha, thus it is called like this.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b25_22']	以法緣中不緣佛故，名曰無緣。	以法緣中不緣佛故，名曰無緣。	005	Because within the Dharma's aspect, it does not take the Buddha as its object, it is called no-object.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b27_7']	「以是」下結，以前二中不緣如來，故曰無緣，當相應名如來緣矣。	「以是」下結，以前二中不緣如來，故曰無緣，當相應名如來緣矣。	005	For this reason concludes by saying that because within the previous two aspects it does not take the Tathāgata as its object, it is called no-object. According to its characteristics, it should be called the Tathāgata's aspect.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b27_10']	問曰：	問曰：	005	Question:
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b28_3']	何故緣於如來為益眾生？	何故緣於如來為益眾生？	005	Why does taking the Tathāgata as its object benefit sentient beings?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b29_3']	若益眾生應是法緣，何故不名為法緣乎？	若益眾生應是法緣，何故不名為法緣乎？	005	If it benefits sentient beings, it should be the Dharma's aspect. Why is it not called the Dharma's aspect?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b29_18']	通亦是法，但佛是人，故不名法。	通亦是法，但佛是人，故不名法。	005	The answer is: It is also the Dharma, but because the Buddha is a person, it is not called the Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748b30_11']	又為簡別世間法故不名法緣。	又為簡別世間法故不名法緣。	005	Moreover, in order to distinguish it from worldly dharmas, it is not called dharma-contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748c01_11']	若佛是人，即是眾生，何故不名眾生緣乎？	若佛是人，即是眾生，何故不名眾生緣乎？	005	If the Buddha is a person, he is a sentient being, so why is he not called sentient being-contemplation?
['ZH_T37_1764_005:0748c02_16']	通則如來亦是眾生，為欲簡別所益眾生，故不名之。	通則如來亦是眾生，為欲簡別所益眾生，故不名之。	005	In a general sense, the Tathāgata is also a sentient being, but in order to distinguish the sentient beings he benefits, he is not called that.
