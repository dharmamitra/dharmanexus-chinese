['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0234a27_3']	故《六門陀羅尼經》云「我之所有眾魔之業若未先悔，終不發心緣無上覺。	故《六門陀羅尼經》云「我之所有眾魔之業若未先悔，終不發心緣無上覺。	03b	Therefore, the Six Gates Dhāraṇī Sūtra says, All the evil karma I have, if not repented first, I will never arouse the aspiration to seek supreme enlightenment.

['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b02_18']	有二解。	有二解。	03b	There are two explanations.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b02_21']	一云：	一云：	03b	The first says:
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b04_14']	惑業苦三總得名業，如言煩惱障即大隨惑，二所發業并及於果，總名煩惱障。	惑業苦三總得名業，如言煩惱障即大隨惑，二所發業并及於果，總名煩惱障。	03b	Afflictions, karma, and suffering are all called karma. It is said that the afflictions are the great secondary afflictions, the karma produced by the two, and the fruits, are all called afflictions.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b05_9']	準彼相從業因業果，總名為業。	準彼相從業因業果，總名為業。	03b	According to that, the causes and fruits of karma are generally called karma.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b05_11']	問：	問：	03b	The question:
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b06_2']	若爾，何故不云滅惑苦障？	若爾，何故不云滅惑苦障？	03b	If so, why not say that afflictions and suffering are destroyed?
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b06_4']	答：	答：	03b	The answer:
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b06_14']	隨舉於一，皆有難故。	隨舉於一，皆有難故。	03b	Raising one of them all has difficulties.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b07_4']	或可業礙聖道，勝惑名故。	或可業礙聖道，勝惑名故。	03b	Or it may be that karma obstructs the holy path, because the name is superior to afflictions.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b08_1']	所以業有定業，惑中不說有定惑故。	所以業有定業，惑中不說有定惑故。	03b	Therefore, among karma and afflictions, only karma has fixed karma, while afflictions are not said to have fixed afflictions.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b08_15']	苦由業生，故但從勝名滅業障。	苦由業生，故但從勝名滅業障。	03b	Suffering arises from karma, so it is only named after the superior, as destroying karmic hindrances.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b08_18']	一云：	一云：	03b	One says:
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b10_5']	雖惑業苦俱得障名，業障增強，但偏懺業，以業招生親於惑故。	雖惑業苦俱得障名，業障增強，但偏懺業，以業招生親於惑故。	03b	Although afflictions, karma, and suffering are all called hindrances, karmic hindrances are the strongest, so only karma is repented, because karma is the direct cause of rebirth.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b11_10']	下請云「曾所造作業障罪者，云何懺悔」，不問惑苦故。	下請云「曾所造作業障罪者，云何懺悔」，不問惑苦故。	03b	The request below says, For the karmic hindrances and offenses I have created, how should I repent? It does not ask about afflictions and suffering.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b12_20']	又若有極重不善之業，必招難身，無暇入聖，故經但云〈滅業障品〉。	又若有極重不善之業，必招難身，無暇入聖，故經但云〈滅業障品〉。	03b	Moreover, if there is extremely heavy unwholesome karma, it will definitely lead to a difficult body, without leisure to enter the holy, so the sutra only says Chapter on Destroying Karmic Hindrances.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b13_12']	前釋為究，下文具懺惑業苦故。	前釋為究，下文具懺惑業苦故。	03b	The previous explanation is thorough, because the text below fully repents afflictions, karma, and suffering.

['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b14_13']	惑業苦三攝盡二障，未知所知障今亦懺不？	惑業苦三攝盡二障，未知所知障今亦懺不？	03b	The three of afflictions, karma, and suffering completely encompass the two hindrances. I wonder if the known hindrances are also repented now?
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b14_15']	答：	答：	03b	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b16_2']	既趣佛果，二障俱懺，故說云「修菩提行，所有業障悉皆懺悔。	既趣佛果，二障俱懺，故說云「修菩提行，所有業障悉皆懺悔。	03b	Since one is heading for the fruition of Buddhahood, both hindrances are repented. Therefore, it is said, In cultivating the practices of Bodhi, all karmic hindrances are completely repented.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b16_5']	」問：	」問：	03b	Question:
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b16_14']	三性之業為總懺不？	三性之業為總懺不？	03b	Are the karmas of the three natures included in the general repentance?
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b16_16']	答：	答：	03b	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b16_21']	三性俱懺。	三性俱懺。	03b	All three natures are repented of.
['ZH_T39_1788_03b:0241b17_18']	由於二障發三性業故，招人天業亦皆懺故。	由於二障發三性業故，招人天業亦皆懺故。	03b	Because the two hindrances give rise to karmas of the three natures, and karmas that attract human and heavenly rebirths are also all repented of.
