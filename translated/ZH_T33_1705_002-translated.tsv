['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b06_2']	取此二名，是名名假。	取此二名，是名名假。	002	Taking these two names is called the provisional name.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b06_17']	自實無體，籍他方有，是名為假。	自實無體，籍他方有，是名為假。	002	It has no substance of its own, and only exists based on others, so it is called provisional.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b08_8']	又色陰是法、受等是名，一切世間中但有名與色，而今有三別說也云云。	又色陰是法、受等是名，一切世間中但有名與色，而今有三別說也云云。	002	Moreover, the form aggregate is the dharma, and the feelings, etc. are the names. In all worlds, there are only names and forms, but now there are three separate explanations.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b09_4']	言虛實者，一虛、二實，相形得稱。	言虛實者，一虛、二實，相形得稱。	002	As for emptiness and reality, one is empty and two are real, which are mutually defined.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b10_4']	陰法是虛，凡夫謂實，智欲了知求不可得。	陰法是虛，凡夫謂實，智欲了知求不可得。	002	The dharma of the aggregates is empty, but ordinary people consider it real. Wisdom desires to understand but cannot be attained.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b11_1']	只實而虛名為虛實，此通意也。	只實而虛名為虛實，此通意也。	002	Only reality is emptiness, which is called emptiness and reality. This is the general meaning.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b11_16']	若說別義者，三假之中各有三觀。	若說別義者，三假之中各有三觀。	002	If the specific meaning is explained, within the three provisions, each has three contemplations.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b12_11']	法假即虛，是空觀，空即假實。	法假即虛，是空觀，空即假實。	002	The provisional dharmas are empty, which is the contemplation of emptiness. Emptiness is the same as the provisional and the real.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b13_13']	一色一香無非般若，是假觀，觀之一字是中觀。	一色一香無非般若，是假觀，觀之一字是中觀。	002	Every single form and every single fragrance is none other than prajñā. This is the contemplation of the provisional. The single word contemplation is the contemplation of the middle.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b14_15']	以空假是方便道故不立觀名，得入中道方獨稱觀。	以空假是方便道故不立觀名，得入中道方獨稱觀。	002	Because emptiness and the provisional are the path of skillful means, they are not called contemplation. Only upon entering the middle way is it uniquely called contemplation.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b15_5']	受及名等類此可解。	受及名等類此可解。	002	Feeling and names and so forth can be understood in this way.

['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b18_2']	《智度論》云「諸法非實，凡夫虛假，憶想分別妄謂有人，如狗臨井自叱其影。	《智度論》云「諸法非實，凡夫虛假，憶想分別妄謂有人，如狗臨井自叱其影。	002	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says: The dharmas are not real. Ordinary beings falsely imagine and discriminate, mistakenly thinking there is a person, like a dog looking into a well and barking at its own reflection.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b19_2']	水中無狗但有相影，而生惡心投井而死。	水中無狗但有相影，而生惡心投井而死。	002	There are no dogs in the water, only the reflection of forms, yet it gives rise to malice and jumps into the well to die.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b21_1']	」眾生亦爾，四大和合名之為身，因緣生義動作語言，凡夫於中妄起人相，此法假也。	」眾生亦爾，四大和合名之為身，因緣生義動作語言，凡夫於中妄起人相，此法假也。	002	Sentient beings are also like this. The combination of the four elements is called the body. The meaning of dependent arising gives rise to actions and speech. Ordinary beings falsely give rise to the notion of a person within this. This is the provisional of dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b21_17']	生愛恚起愚樂墮三惡道，此受假也。	生愛恚起愚樂墮三惡道，此受假也。	002	Giving rise to love and hatred, creating ignorance and pleasure, falling into the three evil destinies. This is the provisional of feeling.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b26_12']	又一切法但從名字和合，更無餘名，如頭足腹脊，和合故假名為身，如髮眼耳鼻口皮骨和合故假名為頭，諸毛和合假名為髮、分分合故假名為毛，諸泥塵和合故假名為分，亦和合諸分故名為塵，此即名假也。	又一切法但從名字和合，更無餘名，如頭足腹脊，和合故假名為身，如髮眼耳鼻口皮骨和合故假名為頭，諸毛和合假名為髮、分分合故假名為毛，諸泥塵和合故假名為分，亦和合諸分故名為塵，此即名假也。	002	Moreover, all dharmas are merely provisional names based on the combination of names, with no other names. For example, the combination of head, feet, belly, and spine is provisionally called a body. The combination of hair, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin, and bones is provisionally called a head. The combination of hairs is provisionally called hair, and the combination of parts is provisionally called a hair. The combination of particles of mud is provisionally called a part, and the combination of parts is provisionally called a particle. This is the provisional name.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b27_2']	以此假故，一切法空。	以此假故，一切法空。	002	Because of this provisionality, all dharmas are empty.

This is the sequential explanation of cause and effect.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259b29_13']	以法假故空，受假故無相，名假故無作。	以法假故空，受假故無相，名假故無作。	002	Because of the provisionality of dharmas, there is emptiness. Because of the provisionality of experience, there is no appearance. Because of the provisionality of names, there is no action.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c01_7']	故《大論》云「因三十七品趣涅槃門。	故《大論》云「因三十七品趣涅槃門。	002	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says: Based on the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, one enters the gate of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c02_2']	」涅槃門有三，謂空、無相、無作等。	」涅槃門有三，謂空、無相、無作等。	002	The gate of nirvāṇa has three aspects, namely emptiness, no appearance, and no action, and so forth.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c04_1']	言空門者，觀諸法無我我所，諸法從因緣和合而有，無有作者無有受者，是名空門。	言空門者，觀諸法無我我所，諸法從因緣和合而有，無有作者無有受者，是名空門。	002	As for the gate of emptiness, contemplating that all dharmas are without self or possessions, all dharmas exist through the combination of causes and conditions, without an agent and without a receiver, this is called the gate of emptiness.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c06_6']	無相門者，觀身雖空而有相在，人著此相故修無相，如說俯仰屈伸住立去來觀瞻言語，於中無實。	無相門者，觀身雖空而有相在，人著此相故修無相，如說俯仰屈伸住立去來觀瞻言語，於中無實。	002	The gate of signlessness means that although the body is empty, there are still signs. Because people are attached to these signs, they cultivate signlessness. As it is said, looking up, looking down, bending, stretching, standing, walking, looking, and speaking, there is no reality in them.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c07_6']	風依識故有所作者，是識滅相，念念無故。	風依識故有所作者，是識滅相，念念無故。	002	Because the wind relies on consciousness, there is something that is done. This consciousness is extinguished, and because of moment-to-moment non-existence,
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c09_4']	此男女有我，心無智慧故妄見有，骨鎖相連皮肉覆機關動作如木人，此無相門也。	此男女有我，心無智慧故妄見有，骨鎖相連皮肉覆機關動作如木人，此無相門也。	002	this male and female have a self. Because the mind lacks wisdom, falsely seeing the bones connected by skin and flesh, the mechanism moving like a wooden person, this is the gate of signlessness.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c09_19']	無作門者，無相亦無，是名無作。	無作門者，無相亦無，是名無作。	002	The gate of wishlessness means that even signlessness is nonexistent, this is called wishlessness.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c11_2']	此三定諸禪中若無不名三昧，以退失故墮生死中。	此三定諸禪中若無不名三昧，以退失故墮生死中。	002	Among these three concentrations and various dhyānas, if there is no [wishlessness], it is not called samādhi, because one regresses and falls into the cycle of birth and death.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c13_12']	如說能持淨戒名比丘，能觀空名行空人，一心常勤精進者是名真實行道人，此三能到涅槃，得三解脫門云云。	如說能持淨戒名比丘，能觀空名行空人，一心常勤精進者是名真實行道人，此三能到涅槃，得三解脫門云云。	002	It is said that one who can uphold pure precepts is called a bhikṣu, one who contemplates emptiness is called a practitioner of emptiness, and one who is always diligent and energetic is called a true practitioner of the Way. These three are able to reach nirvāṇa and attain the three gates of liberation.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c14_6']	「四諦十二因緣」者，次歎諦緣。	「四諦十二因緣」者，次歎諦緣。	002	The four truths and the twelve links of dependent arising - next, praise the truths and conditions.

['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c19_1']	苦等四法審實不虛，名之為諦。	苦等四法審實不虛，名之為諦。	002	The four dharmas such as suffering are true and not false, and are called truths.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c19_19']	若苦集是有漏、滅道是無漏，此三藏也。	若苦集是有漏、滅道是無漏，此三藏也。	002	If suffering and accumulation are with outflows, and cessation and the path are without outflows, this is the Tripiṭaka Teaching.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c20_8']	若四俱無漏，是通也。	若四俱無漏，是通也。	002	If the four are all without outflows, this is the Shared Teaching.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c21_2']	若四俱亦有漏亦無漏，是別也。	若四俱亦有漏亦無漏，是別也。	002	If the four are both contaminated and uncontaminated, this is the distinct.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0259c21_15']	若四俱非漏非無漏，是圓也。	若四俱非漏非無漏，是圓也。	002	If the four are neither contaminated nor uncontaminated, this is the perfect.

At this time, there is no Buddha, and the Buddha Dharma has already ceased. They are born seven times in the human realm and also in the heavens, and do not undergo eight births. They awaken on their own and attain the Way, and thus become a lesser pratyekabuddha.

Three animals crossing a river, three birds escaping a net - the river is the same, but the animals are different; the net is one, but the birds are distinct.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0260a20_13']	故《大經》云「下智觀故聲聞菩提，中智觀故緣覺菩提，上智觀菩薩菩提，上上智觀故諸佛菩提。	故《大經》云「下智觀故聲聞菩提，中智觀故緣覺菩提，上智觀菩薩菩提，上上智觀故諸佛菩提。	002	Therefore the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, By contemplating with inferior wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of śrāvakas; by contemplating with middling wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of pratyekabuddhas; by contemplating with superior wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of bodhisattvas; by contemplating with the most superior wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of buddhas.

['ZH_T33_1705_002:0260a23_5']	緣覺，佛在世亦有，只在聲聞中攝。	緣覺，佛在世亦有，只在聲聞中攝。	002	Pratyekabuddhas also exist in the world when a Buddha is present, they are simply included among the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T33_1705_002:0260a24_7']	言出無佛世者，此對聲聞，非謂佛世總無緣覺也。	言出無佛世者，此對聲聞，非謂佛世總無緣覺也。	002	As for the statement that they appear in worlds without a Buddha, this is in contrast to the śrāvakas, it does not mean that there are no pratyekabuddhas in the world when a Buddha is present.
