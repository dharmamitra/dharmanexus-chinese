The Sixth Precept on Compassionately Upholding and Guiding. If a disciple of the Buddha always gives rise to a mind of great compassion, and when entering all cities and houses sees all sentient beings, he should proclaim, You sentient beings should all receive the three refuges and the ten precepts. If he sees cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, and all other animals, he should think in his mind and say, You are animals, give rise to the mind of enlightenment. Thus, the bodhisattva enters all places, mountains, rivers, forests, and fields, causing all sentient beings to give rise to the mind of enlightenment. If the bodhisattva does not give rise to the mind of teaching and transforming sentient beings, he commits a minor offense. The following four precepts are about compassionately teaching and transforming.

The Seventh Precept on Respectfully Expounding the Dharma. If a Buddhist disciple always engages in teaching and arouses a mind of great compassion, when entering the homes of wealthy patrons and all assemblies, he should not stand to expound the Dharma for laypeople. He should sit on a high seat in front of the assembly of laypeople. The Dharma master bhikṣu should not stand on the ground to expound the Dharma for the four assemblies. When expounding the Dharma, the Dharma master should sit on a high seat, with offerings of incense and flowers. The four assemblies listening should sit below, like filial obedience to parents and respectful obedience to the teachings of the master, like serving the fire-worshipping brāhmans. If the expounder of the Dharma does not expound the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, he commits a minor offense.
