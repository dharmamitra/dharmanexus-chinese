['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a06_5']	信受波若義。	信受波若義。	the meaning of believing and accepting prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a08_4']	所以明信受者，上說波若即是能被之教，今明信受即是所被之緣，此即是緣教相稱。	所以明信受者，上說波若即是能被之教，今明信受即是所被之緣，此即是緣教相稱。	The reason for clarifying belief and acceptance is that above it is said that prajñā is the teaching that is able to cover, and now it is clarified that belief and acceptance are the conditions that are covered. This is the correspondence between conditions and teaching.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a08_17']	若緣非教緣，此教則不稱緣；	若緣非教緣，此教則不稱緣；	If the conditions are not the conditions for the teaching, then the teaching does not correspond to the conditions;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a09_10']	若教非緣教，此緣則不稟教。	若教非緣教，此緣則不稟教。	if the teaching is not the teaching for the conditions, then the conditions do not receive the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a10_17']	以今緣是教緣故，此緣稟教得益，以教是緣教故，此則不空說。	以今緣是教緣故，此緣稟教得益，以教是緣教故，此則不空說。	Because the present conditions are the conditions for the teaching, these conditions receive the teaching and gain benefits; because the teaching is the teaching for the conditions, it is not spoken in vain.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a11_9']	為此因緣，故緣教相稱也。	為此因緣，故緣教相稱也。	For this reason, the conditions and teaching correspond.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a13_15']	今就信受門說於般若，所以了悟無依無得，故名信受。	今就信受門說於般若，所以了悟無依無得，故名信受。	Now, in the gate of faith and acceptance, prajñā is explained. Because it is understood that there is no reliance and no attainment, it is called faith and acceptance.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a14_12']	說此無依無得之信，即是說般若義也。	說此無依無得之信，即是說般若義也。	Explaining this faith of no reliance and no attainment is precisely explaining the meaning of prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a15_2']	就此門中問答為二：	就此門中問答為二：	In this gate, there are two parts: questions and answers.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a16_14']	所以問者，上明因辨果義已周滿，是故今問信受之人。	所以問者，上明因辨果義已周滿，是故今問信受之人。	The reason for asking is that above, the meaning of explaining the cause and revealing the effect is already complete, so now he asks about the person who has faith and acceptance.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a18_7']	然因是無所得因、果是無所得果，因是無所得因，雖行萬行而實無所行；	然因是無所得因、果是無所得果，因是無所得因，雖行萬行而實無所行；	Moreover, the cause is the cause of no attainment, and the effect is the effect of no attainment. Although the cause is the cause of no attainment, even though one practices myriad practices, in reality there is nothing to practice;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a19_4']	果是無所得果，雖得菩提而實無所得。	果是無所得果，雖得菩提而實無所得。	The effect is the effect of no attainment, even though one attains bodhi, in reality there is nothing to attain.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a19_9', 'ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a20_9']	此事難信。🔽若實有萬行可行、實有佛果可得，信之則易；	此事難信。 若實有萬行可行、實有佛果可得，信之則易；	This matter is difficult to believe.🔽If there are truly myriad practices to be practiced and a buddha-result to be attained, then believing it is easy;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a21_10']	若實無萬行可行、實無佛果可得，信之了亦易；	若實無萬行可行、實無佛果可得，信之了亦易；	If there are truly no myriad practices to be practiced and no buddha-result to be attained, then believing it is also easy;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a22_16']	若言俗諦自有因果、真諦自無因果，有無各轍，信之亦易。	若言俗諦自有因果、真諦自無因果，有無各轍，信之亦易。	If it is said that the conventional truth has its own causes and effects, while the ultimate truth has no causes and effects, with existence and non-existence each following a separate track, it is also easy to believe.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a25_4']	今竝不然，雖修萬行，而不見菩薩能行、不見萬行可行，無所依止而修萬行，濟度眾生，此事希有，是以難信。	今竝不然，雖修萬行，而不見菩薩能行、不見萬行可行，無所依止而修萬行，濟度眾生，此事希有，是以難信。	However, this is not the case. Although one cultivates myriad practices, one does not see the bodhisattva who can practice, nor does one see the myriad practices that can be practiced. Without relying on anything, one cultivates myriad practices to deliver sentient beings. This matter is rare, and therefore difficult to believe.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a26_19']	如空中種樹，不依於地，而溉灌修治有於華實，此事為難，是故今問明有信者。	如空中種樹，不依於地，而溉灌修治有於華實，此事為難，是故今問明有信者。	It is like planting a tree in the sky, not relying on the ground, yet through watering and tending, there are flowers and fruits. This matter is difficult, and therefore I now ask about those who have faith.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a27_17']	若言佛身同於二乘，是生滅法，亦易信；	若言佛身同於二乘，是生滅法，亦易信；	If it is said that the Buddha's body is the same as that of the two vehicles, which are dharmas that arise and cease, it is also easy to believe;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a28_19']	若言佛身是常住法，凝然在金剛後心，此亦易信；	若言佛身是常住法，凝然在金剛後心，此亦易信；	If it is said that the Buddha's body is a permanent dharma, abiding in the mind after the vajra [stage], this is also easy to believe;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105a29_18']	若言應身自無常，法身自是常，此亦易信。	若言應身自無常，法身自是常，此亦易信。	If it is said that the response body is impermanent by itself, while the Dharma body is permanent by itself, this is also easy to believe.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b01_10']	今明如來雖生，畢竟不生；	今明如來雖生，畢竟不生；	Now it is clarified that although the Tathāgata appears to be born, he is ultimately unborn;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b01_18']	雖滅，畢竟不滅。	雖滅，畢竟不滅。	Although he appears to pass into extinction, he is ultimately unceasing.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b04_7']	答曰：	答曰：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b05_18']	現在眾生福慧深厚，三多具足，在祇洹受道，聞必生信，故不問現在。	現在眾生福慧深厚，三多具足，在祇洹受道，聞必生信，故不問現在。	The present sentient beings have deep and thick blessings and wisdom, and are endowed with the three excellences. They receive the Way in Jetavana. Hearing it, they will surely give rise to faith, so the present is not asked about.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b07_18']	但佛滅度後，後五百歲入像法中，此時眾生薄福鈍根，雖尋經文，不能通了，故聞不生信。	但佛滅度後，後五百歲入像法中，此時眾生薄福鈍根，雖尋經文，不能通了，故聞不生信。	But after the Buddha's nirvana, in the five hundred years after, they enter the semblance dharma. At this time, the sentient beings have shallow blessings and dull faculties. Although they search through the scriptures, they cannot understand them, so hearing it, they do not give rise to faith.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b10_4']	《大智論》解信毀品文云「佛滅度後五百歲後，有五百部皆執佛語，不知佛意為解脫故，聞畢竟空，如刀傷心。	《大智論》解信毀品文云「佛滅度後五百歲後，有五百部皆執佛語，不知佛意為解脫故，聞畢竟空，如刀傷心。	The Dazhidulun explains the text of the chapter on faith and slander, saying: Five hundred years after the Buddha's nirvana, there were five hundred schools, all grasping the Buddha's words, not knowing the Buddha's intention for liberation. Hearing the ultimate emptiness, it is like a knife wounding the heart.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b11_2']	」故知未來能信人少，故知問未來世也。	」故知未來能信人少，故知問未來世也。	Therefore, we know that in the future, there will be few people who can believe, so we know it is asking about the future world.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b13_6']	又此舉未來有信以況現在，未來是惡世，外不值佛、內薄福鈍根尚信波若，況現世之人聞不生信？	又此舉未來有信以況現在，未來是惡世，外不值佛、內薄福鈍根尚信波若，況現世之人聞不生信？	Moreover, this brings up future faith to illustrate the present. The future is an evil age, externally not encountering the Buddha, internally lacking blessings and dull faculties, yet still believing in prajñā, let alone people in the present world who would not give rise to faith upon hearing it?

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b25_9']	今舉最後五百，此是像法將滅衰弊之時，亦有信般若者，況前兩五百無信人耶？	今舉最後五百，此是像法將滅衰弊之時，亦有信般若者，況前兩五百無信人耶？	Now, the last five hundred years are mentioned. This is a time of decline at the end of the semblance Dharma, yet there are still those who have faith in prajñā. How much more so would there be people without faith in the first two five hundred years?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b26_16', 'ZH_T33_1699_003:0105b27_14']	今謂不然，言後五百歲者，如《大智論》明五百歲已後也。🔽前五百年得道者多、不得者少，故名正法。	今謂不然，言後五百歲者，如《大智論》明五百歲已後也。 前五百年得道者多、不得者少，故名正法。	Now, this is not so. As for the last five hundred years, it is as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra explains, after five hundred years.🔽In the first five hundred years, those who attained the Way were many, and those who did not attain it were few, so it is called the true Dharma.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c02_15']	此中雖多不信，如五百部之例，然亦有信受之人，故《大品》云「是波若波羅蜜，佛滅度後，南方轉至北方。	此中雖多不信，如五百部之例，然亦有信受之人，故《大品》云「是波若波羅蜜，佛滅度後，南方轉至北方。	Although many do not believe in this period, like the example of the five hundred schools, there are still people who believe and accept it. Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra says: This prajñāpāramitā, after the Buddha's nirvāṇa, will spread from the south to the north.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c05_7']	前五百是正法故聞有信，後五百是像法故聞不信。	前五百是正法故聞有信，後五百是像法故聞不信。	The first five hundred years are the true Dharma, so hearing it leads to faith. The latter five hundred years are the semblance Dharma, so hearing it leads to disbelief.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c07_2']	若爾，後五百年無信波若，故佛今答云後五百亦有信者，不應言無信者也。	若爾，後五百年無信波若，故佛今答云後五百亦有信者，不應言無信者也。	If that is so, since there is no faith in prajñā in the latter five hundred years, the Buddha now answers that there are also believers in the latter five hundred years, and one should not say there are no believers.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c07_14']	此時亦有信持乃至供養也。	此時亦有信持乃至供養也。	At this time, there are also those who have faith and uphold it, and even make offerings to it.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c10_14']	持戒人多是出家菩薩，修福多是在家菩薩。	持戒人多是出家菩薩，修福多是在家菩薩。	Those who uphold precepts are mostly renunciant bodhisattvas, while those who cultivate merit are mostly householder bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c11_19']	《大智論》云「出家菩薩以尸羅為首，在家菩薩以檀為首。	《大智論》云「出家菩薩以尸羅為首，在家菩薩以檀為首。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, Renunciant bodhisattvas take precepts as foremost, while householder bodhisattvas take giving as foremost.

If they are the two types of people of the Lesser Vehicle with attainment, they do not believe in prajñā. Therefore, the text below says, Those who delight in the lesser Dharma cannot listen to, accept, read, or recite this sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c15_9']	若大乘二人樂無所得，乃信是法。	若大乘二人樂無所得，乃信是法。	If the two types of people of the Great Vehicle delight in non-attainment, they then believe in this Dharma.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0105c22_16']	持戒是止善、修福是行蓋，此二攝一切善盡，則諸惡莫作、諸善奉行，故舉此二攝一切人也。	持戒是止善、修福是行蓋，此二攝一切善盡，則諸惡莫作、諸善奉行，故舉此二攝一切人也。	Upholding precepts is the wholesome deed of stopping, cultivating blessings is the wholesome deed of practicing, these two encompass all wholesome deeds, then it is not committing any evil and upholding all wholesome deeds, thus it mentions these two to encompass all people.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b06_5']	第一、舉小乘因成格量義；	第一、舉小乘因成格量義；	First, using the causes of the Hinayana to form the meaning of the comparison;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b06_17']	第二、舉小乘果成格量義。	第二、舉小乘果成格量義。	Second, using the fruits of the Hinayana to form the meaning of the comparison.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b07_2']	今即是初。	今即是初。	This is the first part now.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b07_5']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b07_17']	云何舉大小乘義成格量耶？	云何舉大小乘義成格量耶？	How does using the meanings of the Mahayana and Hinayana form the comparison?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b07_19']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b08_2']	前章云：	前章云：	The previous chapter says:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b09_13']	如來所說皆不可取不可說，乃至一切賢聖皆體悟實相無為而有差別。	如來所說皆不可取不可說，乃至一切賢聖皆體悟實相無為而有差別。	What the Tathagata speaks is all ungraspable and indescribable, and even all sages and saints realize the unconditioned true nature and have distinctions.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b11_12']	然此語意即是明悟實相無依無得之義，以悟無依無得故，須有大小乘賢聖不同。	然此語意即是明悟實相無依無得之義，以悟無依無得故，須有大小乘賢聖不同。	However, the meaning of these words is precisely to clarify the meaning of realizing the true nature as being without basis and without attainment. Because of realizing without basis and without attainment, there must be differences between the sages and saints of the Mahayana and Hinayana.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b11_16']	疑者云：	疑者云：	The doubters say:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b13_11']	若言諸法不可取、不可說、無依無得者，云何小乘取得四果乃至大乘證得佛耶？	若言諸法不可取、不可說、無依無得者，云何小乘取得四果乃至大乘證得佛耶？	If it is said that all dharmas are ungraspable, indescribable, without basis and without attainment, how can the Hinayana attain the four fruits, and how can the Mahayana realize Buddhahood?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b14_11']	以大小乘皆有證得，故知非是無依無得；	以大小乘皆有證得，故知非是無依無得；	Since both the Great and Lesser Vehicles have realization and attainment, we know that it is not without support or without attainment;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b15_11']	以大小乘皆說有證得，故知非是不可說義。	以大小乘皆說有證得，故知非是不可說義。	Since both the Great and Lesser Vehicles speak of realization and attainment, we know that it is not a meaning that cannot be spoken.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b16_13']	今為釋此疑故，明大小乘雖有證得，而實無所得；	今為釋此疑故，明大小乘雖有證得，而實無所得；	Now, in order to resolve this doubt, it clarifies that although the Great and Lesser Vehicles have realization and attainment, they are actually without attainment;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b17_3']	雖有所說，實無所說。	雖有所說，實無所說。	Although there is something spoken, it is actually without speaking.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b19_8']	是故當知無取無說、無依無得，是以舉大小乘釋成上不可取不可說，乃至皆以無為法而有差別也。	是故當知無取無說、無依無得，是以舉大小乘釋成上不可取不可說，乃至皆以無為法而有差別也。	Therefore, we should know that there is no grasping, no speaking, no support, and no attainment. This is why the Great and Lesser Vehicles are used to explain the above cannot be grasped and cannot be spoken, up to all are distinguished by the Dharma of non-action.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b19_18']	云何成上格量？	云何成上格量？	How does this complete the above comparison?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b19_20']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b21_2']	諸法若是可取可說、有依有得者，受持則無功德；	諸法若是可取可說、有依有得者，受持則無功德；	If all dharmas can be grasped, spoken of, supported, and attained, then upholding them would have no merit;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b22_1']	良由波若無取無說，是以受持，其福無邊。	良由波若無取無說，是以受持，其福無邊。	It is precisely because prajñā is without grasping and speaking that upholding it has boundless blessings.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b22_4']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b24_2']	此經下文云「為大乘者說，若樂小法者，不能聽受」，《大品》云「波若是菩薩法，不屬二乘」。	此經下文云「為大乘者說，若樂小法者，不能聽受」，《大品》云「波若是菩薩法，不屬二乘」。	A later passage in this sutra says, It is taught for those of the Mahayana, those who delight in the lesser Dharma cannot listen and accept it. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra says, If it is the Dharma of bodhisattvas, it does not belong to the two vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b24_13']	今云何乃引小乘為證成？	今云何乃引小乘為證成？	How can you now cite the Lesser Vehicle as proof?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b24_15']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b26_9']	此舉小況大，明小乘人尚悟無依無得、無取無說，云何菩薩而不信無所得法耶？	此舉小況大，明小乘人尚悟無依無得、無取無說，云何菩薩而不信無所得法耶？	This uses the lesser to illustrate the greater, clarifying that even practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle still realize non-reliance and non-attainment, non-grasping and non-speaking. How can bodhisattvas not believe in the Dharma of non-attainment?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109b29_1']	如大品引先尼為證，聽者聞諸法畢竟空不信受，故引先尼小乘人尚信法空，今大乘人無相法中豈不信空耶？	如大品引先尼為證，聽者聞諸法畢竟空不信受，故引先尼小乘人尚信法空，今大乘人無相法中豈不信空耶？	Like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra citing Śreṇika as proof, listeners hearing the ultimate emptiness of all dharmas do not believe and accept it, so it cites Śreṇika, a practitioner of the Lesser Vehicle, who still believes in the emptiness of dharmas. How could practitioners of the Mahayana not believe in emptiness within the Dharma of no characteristics?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c01_11']	又今是無所得三乘，是波若善巧方便用，此是大小，非有所得小也。	又今是無所得三乘，是波若善巧方便用，此是大小，非有所得小也。	Moreover, this is the attainment of the three vehicles through non-attainment, the skillful means of prajñā-pāramitā. This is the great and small, not the attainment of the small.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c02_14']	又欲引學小乘人令入大法，欲為小乘亦須學此法。	又欲引學小乘人令入大法，欲為小乘亦須學此法。	Moreover, wishing to lead practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle to enter the great Dharma, wishing to be of the Lesser Vehicle also requires learning this Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c03_4']	如《大品》云「諸天子！	如《大品》云「諸天子！	As the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, Celestial sons!
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c03_19']	汝欲住須陀洹果，亦不離是忍也。	汝欲住須陀洹果，亦不離是忍也。	If you wish to abide in the fruit of stream-entry, you should not depart from this acceptance.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c04_11']	若爾，此法便是通三乘法。	若爾，此法便是通三乘法。	If so, then this Dharma is common to the three vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c04_13']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c05_2']	如觀中道者有三品：	如觀中道者有三品：	Just as there are three levels of insight into the middle way:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c05_13']	下智觀故，得聲聞菩提；	下智觀故，得聲聞菩提；	By observing with lesser wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of the śrāvakas;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c06_3']	中智觀故，得緣覺菩提；	中智觀故，得緣覺菩提；	By observing with middling wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of the pratyekabuddhas;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c06_14']	上智觀故，得佛菩提也。	上智觀故，得佛菩提也。	By observing with superior wisdom, one attains the enlightenment of the buddhas.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c06_16']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c07_15']	何故聲聞法中立於四果，菩薩法中開於十地？	何故聲聞法中立於四果，菩薩法中開於十地？	Why are there four fruits established in the Dharma of the śrāvakas, and ten grounds opened up in the Dharma of the bodhisattvas?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c07_18']	師云：	師云：	The master said:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c08_13']	今須開此一路，此一路擁塞來久。	今須開此一路，此一路擁塞來久。	Now we must open this one path, which has been blocked for a long time.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c10_4']	今明無礙通方悉得聖人善巧，為欲出處眾生，隨其根性故開大小。	今明無礙通方悉得聖人善巧，為欲出處眾生，隨其根性故開大小。	Now, it is understood that the unobstructed and all-encompassing can all attain the skillful means of the sages. In order to deliver sentient beings, according to their faculties and natures, the great and small are opened up.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c11_13']	然至論道門未曾大小，今作大小者，並是赴根緣故開大小方便。	然至論道門未曾大小，今作大小者，並是赴根緣故開大小方便。	However, in discussing the Way, it has never been great or small. Now, those who make it great or small are all responding to the faculties and conditions, and thus open up the expedient means of the great and small.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c12_5']	然大小不同，由有其通別。	然大小不同，由有其通別。	However, the great and small are different, due to their general and specific [meanings].
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c16_13']	若通而為論，大小皆得名地、大小悉得稱果，故如三乘共十地，八人地見地即須陀洹果，薄地即斯陀含果，離欲地即阿那含果，已辦地即阿羅漢果，菩薩法中已辦地屬佛地，是知大小皆得名地。	若通而為論，大小皆得名地、大小悉得稱果，故如三乘共十地，八人地見地即須陀洹果，薄地即斯陀含果，離欲地即阿那含果，已辦地即阿羅漢果，菩薩法中已辦地屬佛地，是知大小皆得名地。	If discussed generally, both the great and small can be called grounds, and both the great and small can be called fruits. Therefore, like the three vehicles' shared ten grounds, the ground of the eighth person and the ground of seeing are the fruit of srota-āpanna, the ground of thin [afflictions] is the fruit of sakṛd-āgāmin, the ground of separation from desire is the fruit of anāgāmin, and the ground of having done is the fruit of arhat. In the bodhisattva teachings, the ground of having done belongs to the ground of the Buddha. Therefore, it is known that both the great and small can be called grounds.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c18_21']	然大小皆名果者，小乘既名四果，菩薩十地亦名十果，故《大品》云「有法是菩薩道，無法是菩薩果」也。	然大小皆名果者，小乘既名四果，菩薩十地亦名十果，故《大品》云「有法是菩薩道，無法是菩薩果」也。	However, both the great and small are called fruits. The small vehicle is called the four fruits, and the ten grounds of the bodhisattva are also called the ten fruits. Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, There are dharmas that are the bodhisattva's path, and there are no dharmas that are the bodhisattva's fruit.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c20_10']	若就別為論，開大小不同，則果地為異，小乘則名因果，菩薩稱為十地。	若就別為論，開大小不同，則果地為異，小乘則名因果，菩薩稱為十地。	If discussed specifically, the distinctions between the great and small are opened up, and then the ground of fruition is different. The small vehicle is called the ground of cause and effect, while the bodhisattva is called the ten grounds.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c21_19']	所以菩薩名地是勝持廣普，能生能成，有此眾義故，與其地名；	所以菩薩名地是勝持廣普，能生能成，有此眾義故，與其地名；	Therefore, the bodhisattva is called the ground because it is superior, vast, able to give rise to, and able to accomplish. Because it has these various meanings, it is given the name ground;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c22_11']	聲聞無此諸義，故不名為地。	聲聞無此諸義，故不名為地。	The śrāvaka does not have these various meanings, so it is not called the ground.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c23_11']	聲聞之人厭老病死，欲入無餘故斷除煩惱；	聲聞之人厭老病死，欲入無餘故斷除煩惱；	The śrāvaka person is disgusted with old age, sickness, and death, and wants to enter nirvāṇa without remainder, so they eliminate afflictions;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c24_7']	數辨蘇息遂其心期，故與其果稱。	數辨蘇息遂其心期，故與其果稱。	Frequently distinguishing the breath in accordance with their mental aspirations, so they are given the name of fruition.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c24_20']	菩薩無此諸事，故不名為果。	菩薩無此諸事，故不名為果。	The bodhisattva does not have these various matters, so it is not called fruition.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c25_12']	然復有互舉之義，其事常通。	然復有互舉之義，其事常通。	However, there is also the meaning of mutually raising, and the matter is always通通.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c25_17']	何以知之？	何以知之？	How do we know this?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c27_5']	如三種皆乘、三種皆道、三種皆地、三種皆聖人，然地豈不通耶？	如三種皆乘、三種皆道、三種皆地、三種皆聖人，然地豈不通耶？	For example, the three kinds are all vehicles, the three kinds are all paths, the three kinds are all grounds, and the three kinds are all sages. However, how could the ground not be 通通?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c27_13']	故知隨舉一義耳。	故知隨舉一義耳。	Therefore, we know it is just a matter of raising one meaning.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c27_15']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0109c29_9']	依小乘義，明惑唯有見諦，思惟斷三界見諦惑既立初果，斷思惟亦立一果。	依小乘義，明惑唯有見諦，思惟斷三界見諦惑既立初果，斷思惟亦立一果。	According to the meaning of the Hīnayāna, it is clear that afflictions only exist in the seen and thought-of. Since the seen afflictions of the three realms are established as the first fruit, the elimination of thought-of is also established as one fruit.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a01_4']	若爾，唯應有二果，何得有四果耶？	若爾，唯應有二果，何得有四果耶？	If that is so, there should only be two fruits, how can there be four fruits?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a02_6']	若斷三界思惟既立三果，三界見諦亦應立三果。	若斷三界思惟既立三果，三界見諦亦應立三果。	If the three fruits are established for the abandonment of the three realms of thought, then the three fruits should also be established for the abandonment of the three realms of seeing.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a04_9']	又若約界而判，既有三界，斷三界惑應有三果，何故斷欲界惑立於二果，斷上二界惑立一果耶？	又若約界而判，既有三界，斷三界惑應有三果，何故斷欲界惑立於二果，斷上二界惑立一果耶？	Moreover, if the realms are used to determine, since there are three realms, there should be three fruits for abandoning the afflictions of the three realms. Why is the second fruit established for abandoning the afflictions of the desire realm, and the one fruit established for abandoning the afflictions of the two upper realms?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a05_13']	若依靜散而判，欲界已為散地，斷欲界惑應立一果。	若依靜散而判，欲界已為散地，斷欲界惑應立一果。	If the scattered and concentrated are used to determine, the desire realm is already a scattered ground, and the abandonment of the afflictions of the desire realm should establish one fruit.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a06_12']	上二界已為靜地，斷二界惑亦應立一果。	上二界已為靜地，斷二界惑亦應立一果。	The two upper realms are already concentrated grounds, and the abandonment of the afflictions of the two realms should also establish one fruit.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a07_8']	今何因緣故，不依此諸義立因果耶？	今何因緣故，不依此諸義立因果耶？	Why is it that the fruits are not established according to these principles now?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a07_10']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a08_17']	此是如來善巧假名制立，無有定相，通而為論，具如問也。	此是如來善巧假名制立，無有定相，通而為論，具如問也。	This is the skillful provisional establishment of the Tathāgata, without fixed characteristics. In general discussion, it is as you have asked.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a10_4']	而今不爾者，斷三界見諦出三塗之表，為聖人故，立初果人。	而今不爾者，斷三界見諦出三塗之表，為聖人故，立初果人。	But it is not so now. The abandonment of the afflictions of the three realms and the transcendence of the three evil destinies is for the sake of becoming an ārya, thus establishing the first fruit.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a12_9']	見惡道塵散八十八頭蛇死，就斷三界思惟，更立三果，斷欲界思惟立於二果，斷上二界思惟立羅漢。	見惡道塵散八十八頭蛇死，就斷三界思惟，更立三果，斷欲界思惟立於二果，斷上二界思惟立羅漢。	Seeing the dust of the evil paths scattered, the eighty-eight heads of snakes die, and approaching the severing of the thoughts of the three realms, three more fruits are established. Severing the thoughts of the desire realm establishes two fruits, severing the thoughts of the upper two realms establishes arhatship.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a14_2']	所以然者，欲界是苦難地，此既難可過度，是以斷欲界惑立於二果。	所以然者，欲界是苦難地，此既難可過度，是以斷欲界惑立於二果。	The reason for this is that the desire realm is a difficult and painful place. Since it is difficult to transcend, therefore severing the delusions of the desire realm establishes two fruits.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a15_12']	上二界非苦難地，已有解基，惑則易斷，是以斷上二界惑立阿羅漢果。	上二界非苦難地，已有解基，惑則易斷，是以斷上二界惑立阿羅漢果。	The upper two realms are not difficult and painful places. There is already a foundation of understanding, and delusions are then easily severed. Therefore severing the delusions of the upper two realms establishes the fruit of arhatship.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a17_14']	言斷欲界惑立二果者，欲界思惟有九品，斷前六品名斯陀含果，具斷後三品立阿那含果。	言斷欲界惑立二果者，欲界思惟有九品，斷前六品名斯陀含果，具斷後三品立阿那含果。	As for severing the delusions of the desire realm and establishing two fruits, the thoughts of the desire realm have nine grades. Severing the first six grades is called the fruit of sakṛd-āgāmin, and completely severing the last three grades establishes the fruit of anāgāmin.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a19_1']	所以斷前六品立斯陀含果者，《毘婆娑》中和須密論師云：	所以斷前六品立斯陀含果者，《毘婆娑》中和須密論師云：	The reason for severing the first six grades and establishing the fruit of sakṛd-āgāmin is that in the Vibhāṣā, the master Vasumitra says:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a20_7']	「前六品煩惱能發無作潤於三塗，是故斷此六品制於一果。	「前六品煩惱能發無作潤於三塗，是故斷此六品制於一果。	The first six grades of afflictions can give rise to unmanifested karma and moisten the three evil destinies. Therefore, severing these six grades controls one fruit.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a22_16']	又且既開惑以為九品，是則上中二三品其惑則重，是以斷之立於一果，後三品既輕故斷之而立阿那含果。	又且既開惑以為九品，是則上中二三品其惑則重，是以斷之立於一果，後三品既輕故斷之而立阿那含果。	Moreover, since the afflictions are divided into nine grades, the upper, middle, and lower three grades of afflictions are heavy, and therefore severing them establishes one fruit. Since the last three grades are light, severing them establishes the fruit of the non-returner.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a23_2']	」莊嚴師云：	」莊嚴師云：	The master of the Adornment says:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0110a24_16']	欲界思惟九品煩惱潤業不同，前之三品潤邊地貧窮，次有三品潤邊地富貴。	欲界思惟九品煩惱潤業不同，前之三品潤邊地貧窮，次有三品潤邊地富貴。	The nine grades of afflictions in the desire realm moisten karma differently. The first three grades moisten the poor in borderlands, while the next three grades moisten the wealthy and noble in borderlands.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a09_6']	所以舉須彌山者，明須彌於十寶山中最大，譬佛於十地中最大。	所以舉須彌山者，明須彌於十寶山中最大，譬佛於十地中最大。	The reason for bringing up Mount Sumeru is to clarify that Sumeru is the largest among the ten jeweled mountains, an analogy for the Buddha being the largest among the ten grounds.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a10_2']	須彌，此云妙高山，亦云安明山也。	須彌，此云妙高山，亦云安明山也。	Sumeru is called the Wonderful High Mountain, also called the Mount of Peace and Brightness.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a16_14']	故今釋云「佛說非身」者，明佛不同須彌，非是有為有漏身，故云非身。	故今釋云「佛說非身」者，明佛不同須彌，非是有為有漏身，故云非身。	Therefore, the explanation now is that the Buddha says non-body to clarify that the Buddha is not the same as Sumeru. It is not a conditioned and defiled body, so it is called non-body.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a19_9']	所以然者，報佛正是修因滿故得菩提。	所以然者，報佛正是修因滿故得菩提。	The reason is that the reward Buddha is precisely the fulfillment of the cultivation of causes, and thus attains enlightenment.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a20_7']	法佛是佛性，未得菩提，故不說法佛；	法佛是佛性，未得菩提，故不說法佛；	The Dharma Buddha is the Buddha-nature, and has not yet attained enlightenment, and thus the Dharma Buddha is not mentioned;

Therefore, the transformation Buddha also does not attain enlightenment. Thus, only the reward Buddha is mentioned.

['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a26_9']	今明布施多，謂諸恒沙世界珍寶應及持經。	今明布施多，謂諸恒沙世界珍寶應及持經。	Now, it explains that the offering of precious treasures in worlds equal to the number of sand grains in the Ganges River should be equal to upholding the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a27_8']	又上大千珍寶但施眾生，故是福田劣。	又上大千珍寶但施眾生，故是福田劣。	Moreover, the precious treasures in the previous section were only offered to sentient beings, and thus the field of blessings was inferior.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a28_9']	今恒沙珍寶供養諸佛，此是福田勝，應及持經。	今恒沙珍寶供養諸佛，此是福田勝，應及持經。	Now, offering precious treasures as numerous as the sands of the Ganges to the buddhas is a superior field of merit, and the merit of upholding the sūtra is also superior.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a29_11']	今明雖施多田勝，由是有所得施，亦不及持經也。	今明雖施多田勝，由是有所得施，亦不及持經也。	Now it is explained that although giving to many superior fields is giving with expectation of reward, it is still inferior to upholding the sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112a29_13']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112b02_3']	先說大千格量既不及持經，何故不即說恒沙珍寶以格量持經耶？	先說大千格量既不及持經，何故不即說恒沙珍寶以格量持經耶？	Why not directly compare upholding the sūtra to offering precious treasures as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, since the previous comparison of a trichiliocosm is still inferior to upholding the sūtra?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112b02_5']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112b05_7']	增數明義從小至多，實應相次，但上聞大千格量不及持經，時會或未了，不及之所以，謂波若猶是可取可說，云何受持四句及勝大千珍寶？	增數明義從小至多，實應相次，但上聞大千格量不及持經，時會或未了，不及之所以，謂波若猶是可取可說，云何受持四句及勝大千珍寶？	The meaning of increasing numbers goes from small to large. In reality, they should follow in sequence. However, when the assembly heard that the comparison of a trichiliocosm is still inferior to upholding the sūtra, they may not yet understand the reason for the inferiority, thinking that prajñā is still graspable and expressible, so why is upholding four sentences and surpassing the precious treasures of a trichiliocosm?
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112b06_19']	是以上廣釋疑，明波若非可取可說故，四句雖少，若持若說其福則多；	是以上廣釋疑，明波若非可取可說故，四句雖少，若持若說其福則多；	Therefore, above it extensively resolves doubts, clarifying that prajñā is not graspable or expressible, so although four sentences are few, if upheld or explained, their merit is great;
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112b07_16']	布施雖多，是可取可說，故其福則少。	布施雖多，是可取可說，故其福則少。	although giving is abundant, it is graspable and expressible, so its merit is small.
['ZH_T33_1699_003:0112b08_17']	所以釋前疑竟，方顯勝之所由，故方更格量也。	所以釋前疑竟，方顯勝之所由，故方更格量也。	Therefore, after resolving the previous doubts, it then reveals the reason for the supremacy, so it further compares the merits.
