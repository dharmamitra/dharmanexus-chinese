['ZH_T38_1767_033:0225c28_20']	初又二：	初又二：	033	The first is also two:
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0225c29_9']	先雙非、次正答三難。	先雙非、次正答三難。	033	First, dual negation, next, correctly answering the three difficulties.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0225c29_18']	此下第一答身在先。	此下第一答身在先。	033	This below is the first answer to the difficulty of the body coming first.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a02_4']	然佛之本義說煩惱為身因，則彼應正難煩惱在先所以。	然佛之本義說煩惱為身因，則彼應正難煩惱在先所以。	033	However, the original meaning of the Buddha's teachings on afflictions as the cause of the body is that they should rightly be criticized for the afflictions being prior.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a03_1']	又難身在先者，相對而來，非其本意。	又難身在先者，相對而來，非其本意。	033	Moreover, the criticism of the body being prior comes as a counterpoint, not as the original intention.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a03_19']	今欲答，正先發遣旁，故先云我無此說。	今欲答，正先發遣旁，故先云我無此說。	033	Now, in answering, first dismissing the secondary, therefore it is said first that I do not make this statement.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a04_8']	汝義亦然，何忽難此？	汝義亦然，何忽難此？	033	Your meaning is also like this, why suddenly criticize this?
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a04_18']	本欲難我，還成我義。	本欲難我，還成我義。	033	Originally wanting to criticize me, it still accomplishes my meaning.

['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a07_10']	初言一時者，除彼所計之一時。	初言一時者，除彼所計之一時。	033	The first says one time, excluding what they consider to be one time.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a08_6']	若是其所解言一時者，此則不可。	若是其所解言一時者，此則不可。	033	If it is what they understand as saying one time, this is not possible.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a09_8']	今言一時，此是前後而一時，亦是一時而前後云云。	今言一時，此是前後而一時，亦是一時而前後云云。	033	Now, saying one time, this is before and after being one time, and also one time being before and after.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a11_2']	第二文中言其前後者，此是一時中之前後，無前後異一時，亦無一時異前後。	第二文中言其前後者，此是一時中之前後，無前後異一時，亦無一時異前後。	033	In the second passage, the phrase its before and after refers to the before and after within a single time, without any difference in time before and after, nor any difference in before and after within a single time.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a12_6']	今只於一時義中說有前後，即煩惱為前、身屬於後。	今只於一時義中說有前後，即煩惱為前、身屬於後。	033	Now, within the meaning of a single time, it is said that there is before and after, with afflictions being before and the body belonging to the latter.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a13_2']	煩惱是因，身即是果，豈非因前果後？	煩惱是因，身即是果，豈非因前果後？	033	Afflictions are the cause, and the body is the effect. How could it not be that the cause is before and the effect is after?
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a13_22']	若如《中論》所明緣成由果，此有別意云云。	若如《中論》所明緣成由果，此有別意云云。	033	If it is as explained in the Madhyamaka-śāstra that conditions are formed by the effect, this has a separate meaning.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a14_2']	私謂：	私謂：	033	I say:
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a15_11']	諸大乘經云無始者，不獨云身、不獨煩惱，若一在前，一則有始。	諸大乘經云無始者，不獨云身、不獨煩惱，若一在前，一則有始。	033	The Mahāyāna sūtras say beginningless not only in reference to the body, nor only in reference to afflictions. If one were before the other, then there would be a beginning.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a17_6']	今經從於對治化機以說，故云要因煩惱故而得有身，仍帶理說，故云雖無前後。	今經從於對治化機以說，故云要因煩惱故而得有身，仍帶理說，故云雖無前後。	033	Now, this sūtra speaks from the perspective of the counteragent and the transformed capacity, thus saying that it is necessary due to afflictions that there is a body. It still speaks from the perspective of principle, thus saying that although there is no before and after.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a18_14']	雖是不盡之詞，不盡是有餘之說，故知實理却是權道之有餘。	雖是不盡之詞，不盡是有餘之說，故知實理却是權道之有餘。	033	Although this is not an exhaustive statement, it is an incomplete statement. Therefore, we know that the true principle is the remainder of the provisional way.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a20_7']	實而言之，非但過去言無先後，只於現在煩惱為身，而作因時亦無先後。	實而言之，非但過去言無先後，只於現在煩惱為身，而作因時亦無先後。	033	In reality, it is not only that past [afflictions and body] have no sequence, but even in the present, when afflictions serve as the cause for the body, there is also no sequence.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a20_11']	何以故？	何以故？	033	Why is this?
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a21_19']	因果無二、色心體一，三道三德一念無乖、五陰五脫剎那理等。	因果無二、色心體一，三道三德一念無乖、五陰五脫剎那理等。	033	Cause and effect are not two, form and mind are of the same essence. The three paths and three virtues are not contradictory in a single thought, and the five aggregates and five liberations are equal in principle in an instant.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a23_3']	貴在衲衣執破，破已了性同空，空無前後內外誰施？	貴在衲衣執破，破已了性同空，空無前後內外誰施？	033	The precious thing is to uphold the broken robe of a monk. Once broken, the nature is the same as emptiness. Emptiness has no sequence, no inside or outside. Who would apply it?
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a24_12']	三十六軸唯從涅槃、五十二眾咸成佛性，至此不了，終歸結緣。	三十六軸唯從涅槃、五十二眾咸成佛性，至此不了，終歸結緣。	033	The thirty-six scrolls are all from nirvana, and the fifty-two assembly all attain buddha-nature. If one does not understand this, it will eventually lead to karmic bonds.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a25_9']	此兩段只有二行，餘經文是釋疑之要也。	此兩段只有二行，餘經文是釋疑之要也。	033	These two sections only have two lines, the rest of the sutra text is the key to resolving doubts.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a26_8']	「從汝意若謂如人二眼」下，第三更取意破。	「從汝意若謂如人二眼」下，第三更取意破。	033	If you think that it is like a person with two eyes... is the third section, further refuting with the meaning.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a27_4']	若言煩惱與身是一時者，不應前後。	若言煩惱與身是一時者，不應前後。	033	If it is said that afflictions and the body are simultaneous, they should not be sequential.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a27_19']	如牛二角，左不因右、右不因左。	如牛二角，左不因右、右不因左。	033	It is like a cow with two horns, the left does not depend on the right, and the right does not depend on the left.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226a29_6']	是事不爾，如炷與明是一時有，而要因炷有明，終不因明有炷。	是事不爾，如炷與明是一時有，而要因炷有明，終不因明有炷。	033	This is not so. Just as the wick and light exist simultaneously, but the light must exist based on the wick, and the wick can never exist based on the light.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b01_4']	煩惱與身亦然，但炷是燈器，因燈有明。	煩惱與身亦然，但炷是燈器，因燈有明。	033	The afflictions and the body are also like this. But the wick is the vessel of the lamp, and the light exists based on the lamp.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b02_19']	而云炷者，但齊火燒者名炷，未燒之時不得名炷云云，明佛此義正是一時因果。	而云炷者，但齊火燒者名炷，未燒之時不得名炷云云，明佛此義正是一時因果。	033	As for the wick, only that which is burned by the fire is called the wick, and that which has not yet been burned cannot be called the wick. The Buddha's meaning here is precisely that of simultaneous cause and effect.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b05_4']	舊說多謂此明眾生之始是一時因果，今謂不然，此不明眾生之始，但明眾生用業得身必由煩惱。	舊說多謂此明眾生之始是一時因果，今謂不然，此不明眾生之始，但明眾生用業得身必由煩惱。	033	The old explanations often say that this clarifies that the beginning of sentient beings is simultaneous cause and effect. I now say that this is not so. This does not clarify the beginning of sentient beings, but only clarifies that sentient beings obtain a body based on karma, which must be due to afflictions.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b05_9']	自有二種：	自有二種：	033	There are two kinds of afflictions:
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b05_19']	一者潤業、二者潤生。	一者潤業、二者潤生。	033	First, nourishing karma; second, nourishing birth.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b06_17']	若潤業者，身果為奢，今之所明正取潤生。	若潤業者，身果為奢，今之所明正取潤生。	033	If nourishing karma, the body's fruition is luxurious. What is being clarified now is precisely nourishing birth.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b08_16']	若依數解，正以生陰之初有染污識為潤生惑，即結一期果報，是為煩惱與身一時而有。	若依數解，正以生陰之初有染污識為潤生惑，即結一期果報，是為煩惱與身一時而有。	033	If we understand it according to the number of aggregates, it is precisely the defiled consciousness at the beginning of birth that moistens the aggregates and becomes the afflictions. It then binds the karmic retribution for one lifetime, which is the afflictions and the body existing simultaneously.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b09_7']	於義為便，但今依後解。	於義為便，但今依後解。	033	This is convenient for the meaning, but now I rely on the latter understanding.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b10_9']	若靈味法師亦用生陰，云初起潤生愛，極似數義。	若靈味法師亦用生陰，云初起潤生愛，極似數義。	033	If Master Lingmi also uses the aggregates of birth, saying that the initial arising of the love that moistens the aggregates is very similar to the meaning of the number of aggregates.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b13_15']	其餘師並云死陰之中起潤生愛，得言一時因果者，此前迦葉章中云由愛無明二因緣故得住壽命，《十地經》云「有漏有取，心生熱惱，種子漸備。	其餘師並云死陰之中起潤生愛，得言一時因果者，此前迦葉章中云由愛無明二因緣故得住壽命，《十地經》云「有漏有取，心生熱惱，種子漸備。	033	The other masters all say that the love that moistens the aggregates arises in the aggregates at death. Those who say that cause and effect can be said to be simultaneous, in the previous chapter on Kāśyapa, it says due to the two causes and conditions of love and ignorance, one is able to maintain life. The Sūtra on the Ten Grounds says with outflows and grasping, the mind gives rise to distress, and the seeds gradually become complete.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b16_1']	」經云有漏有取心生有漏種子，潤生之惑雖在前起，而正由識是有漏故潤生之愛，所以結之是為取識。	」經云有漏有取心生有漏種子，潤生之惑雖在前起，而正由識是有漏故潤生之愛，所以結之是為取識。	033	The sūtra says with outflows and grasping, the mind gives rise to with outflow seeds. Although the afflictions that moisten the aggregates arose previously, it is precisely because consciousness has outflows that the love that moistens the aggregates is able to bind them. This is called grasping consciousness.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b17_6']	有漏已有，即是一時因果之義，故此義意微采靈味之說。	有漏已有，即是一時因果之義，故此義意微采靈味之說。	033	The meaning of having defilements already is precisely the meaning of cause and effect at one time, therefore this meaning subtly selects the teachings of the spiritual flavor.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b18_19']	彼前難云若言一時義亦不可，今答一時而有此義，殊堪反於邪難故也。	彼前難云若言一時義亦不可，今答一時而有此義，殊堪反於邪難故也。	033	The previous objection says if it is said to be at one time, the meaning is also not possible. Now the answer is that at one time there is this meaning, which is especially suitable to reverse the false objection.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b19_18']	故云汝意若謂如人二眼下，正取彼意破之。	故云汝意若謂如人二眼下，正取彼意破之。	033	Therefore it says If your intention is like the two eyes of a person... and so on, which directly takes their intention and refutes it.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b21_7']	明雖俱是同時，實有相因之義，如炷之有明，一時而有而復相因。	明雖俱是同時，實有相因之義，如炷之有明，一時而有而復相因。	033	It clarifies that although they are both simultaneous, there is actually the meaning of mutual causality, like the flame having light, existing at one time and yet mutually causing each other.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b22_10']	「汝意若謂身不在先」下，第三答煩惱在前難，又二：	「汝意若謂身不在先」下，第三答煩惱在前難，又二：	033	If your intention is that the body is not prior... is the third answer to the objection that defilements are prior, and it is also in two parts:
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b23_3']	此先牒彼難、「何以故」下正破。	此先牒彼難、「何以故」下正破。	033	This first summarizes their objection, and from Why is it so? it correctly refutes it.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b23_16']	但此中文有兩家讀之，一云：	但此中文有兩家讀之，一云：	033	But there are two ways of reading this text: one says:
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b24_16']	若以身先，無因緣故名為無者，此是牒於難。	若以身先，無因緣故名為無者，此是牒於難。	033	If it is said that if the body is prior, because there is no cause and condition it is called non-existent, this is a summary of the objection.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b25_7']	汝不應說者，即是非之。	汝不應說者，即是非之。	033	You should not say... is the refutation.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b26_13', 'ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b27_15']	汝不應作如此說一切皆有因緣者，還明一切法實有因緣。🔽然不須如此分句，直云汝不應說一切法有因緣也。	汝不應作如此說一切皆有因緣者，還明一切法實有因緣。 然不須如此分句，直云汝不應說一切法有因緣也。	033	You should not say that all exist with causes and conditions. This clarifies that all dharmas truly have causes and conditions.🔽However, it is not necessary to analyze the sentence in this way. Simply say that you should not say that all dharmas have causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226b29_4']	然彼是自然之義，無有因緣，而言汝不應說一切法有因緣者。	然彼是自然之義，無有因緣，而言汝不應說一切法有因緣者。	033	However, this is the meaning of spontaneity, without causes and conditions. It is said that you should not say that all dharmas have causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226c01_16']	然此三師外道云有二十五諦，皆悉相生，即因緣義，而與佛因緣義異。	然此三師外道云有二十五諦，皆悉相生，即因緣義，而與佛因緣義異。	033	However, these three teachers of non-Buddhist paths say there are twenty-five principles, all of which arise from each other, which is the meaning of causes and conditions, but it is different from the meaning of causes and conditions in Buddhism.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226c03_5']	佛法據過去為因、現在得果，彼家直據現在一世相生以為因緣。	佛法據過去為因、現在得果，彼家直據現在一世相生以為因緣。	033	The Buddhist teaching takes the past as the cause and the present as the result. Their teaching simply takes the arising from each other in the present world as causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226c05_1']	又如勒叉婆有依諦、主諦，如五大造五根，五大是主諦、五根是依諦，並是因緣。	又如勒叉婆有依諦、主諦，如五大造五根，五大是主諦、五根是依諦，並是因緣。	033	Moreover, like the Ṛkṣa-bāhu, there are dependent principles and primary principles. For example, the five great elements produce the five sense organs. The five great elements are the primary principles and the five sense organs are the dependent principles. They are all causes and conditions.

['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226c17_10']	前謂汝義說有五大，後說有香為地、有色為火，如論文香相品中明。	前謂汝義說有五大，後說有香為地、有色為火，如論文香相品中明。	033	The first is that your theory speaks of the existence of five great elements, while the latter speaks of fragrance as earth and color as fire, as explained in the chapter on the characteristics of fragrance in the treatise.
['ZH_T38_1767_033:0226c18_11']	衛世師義，不言香為水、色為地，寧非因緣耶？	衛世師義，不言香為水、色為地，寧非因緣耶？	033	The Vaiśeṣika theory does not speak of fragrance as water and color as earth, so why are they not considered causes and conditions?

The latter is your theory that wetness is the great element of water. Even if it freezes due to cold conditions, you still follow the conditions of wetness, so it is water, not following the conditions of cold, it is earth.
