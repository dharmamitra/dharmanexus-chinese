Using skillful means, he enters the five paths and eight difficult situations. If there are sentient beings to be transformed, he becomes their friend or acquaintance, or their parents, siblings, or relatives, or a wealthy and honored elder. According to the needs of sentient beings, he provides them with food and drink, bedding, bedding articles, and medicine for illness, all without stinginess.
