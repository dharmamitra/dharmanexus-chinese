How can it be limited to the Śrīmālā-sūtra alone?🔽It is the essential purport of the Vaipulya sūtras. I have cherished and savored it for a long time, and pondered over it for many years.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c07_19']	捃拾古今、搜撿經論，撰其文玄，勒成三軸。	捃拾古今、搜撿經論，撰其文玄，勒成三軸。	01a	I have collected ancient and modern [interpretations], and examined sūtras and śāstras, compiling its profound texts into three scrolls.

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c15_7']	眾經所以立名者，然至理無名，聖人無名相中為眾生故假名相說，欲令眾生因此名相悟無名相。	眾經所以立名者，然至理無名，聖人無名相中為眾生故假名相說，欲令眾生因此名相悟無名相。	01a	As for the reason for establishing the names of various sūtras, the ultimate truth is without name. The sages, in the nameless and formless, provisionally use names and forms for the sake of sentient beings, wishing to enable sentient beings to awaken to the nameless and formless through these names and forms.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c17_3']	如懸峯可陟要假繩梯、至道寂寥寔由名相，蓋是垂教之大宗、群聖之本意也。	如懸峯可陟要假繩梯、至道寂寥寔由名相，蓋是垂教之大宗、群聖之本意也。	01a	Just as one must rely on a rope ladder to ascend a steep cliff, so too the ultimate truth is truly due to names and forms. This is the great purport of the teachings and the fundamental intent of the sages.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c18_6']	又所以立名，令依名識法，因法起行，因行得解脫果。	又所以立名，令依名識法，因法起行，因行得解脫果。	01a	Moreover, the reason for establishing names is to enable one to recognize the Dharma based on the name, to give rise to practice based on the Dharma, and to attain the fruit of liberation based on practice.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c20_7']	龍樹呵五百部云「不知佛意為於解脫故」，《法華經》云「如來所演經典，皆為度脫諸眾生故」。	龍樹呵五百部云「不知佛意為於解脫故」，《法華經》云「如來所演經典，皆為度脫諸眾生故」。	01a	Nāgârjuna criticized the five hundred schools, saying, They do not understand the Buddha's intention, which is for the sake of liberation. The Lotus Sūtra says, The sūtras expounded by the Tathāgata are all for the sake of liberating all sentient beings.

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c25_9']	為彼鈍人聞略題目未解，尋廣文乃悟。	為彼鈍人聞略題目未解，尋廣文乃悟。	01a	for those of dull faculties, hearing the concise title is not yet understood, and only upon reading the extensive text are they enlightened.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c26_8']	又為鈍根人不能具受廣經，便略持一題；	又為鈍根人不能具受廣經，便略持一題；	01a	Moreover, for those of dull faculties who are unable to fully receive the extensive sūtra, they briefly uphold one title;
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c27_3']	為利根人堪能廣持，故明一部。	為利根人堪能廣持，故明一部。	01a	for those of sharp faculties who are capable of extensively upholding it, therefore the entire text is explained.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c28_4']	又為欲簡別使眾部不同，是故諸經各題名字；	又為欲簡別使眾部不同，是故諸經各題名字；	01a	Moreover, in order to distinguish and make the various texts different, therefore each sūtra has its own title;
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0001c29_3']	欲令眾生因於眾題各解諸法，故明一部。	欲令眾生因於眾題各解諸法，故明一部。	01a	in order to cause sentient beings to understand various dharmas based on the various titles, therefore the entire text is explained.

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a01_15']	若韋陀、廣主，謂外道經名；	若韋陀、廣主，謂外道經名；	01a	If the Vedas and the Mahābhārata are called the titles of non-Buddhist scriptures;
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a02_3']	般若、涅槃，內教之稱。	般若、涅槃，內教之稱。	01a	prajñā and nirvāṇa are the terms of the Buddhist teachings.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a02_15']	亦如三墳五典，震旦俗書；	亦如三墳五典，震旦俗書；	01a	It is also like the Three Ancient Tombs and the Five Classics, the secular books of China;

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a04_16']	次明立名通別門者，有人言：	次明立名通別門者，有人言：	01a	Next, explaining the gate of the general and specific names, some people say:
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a05_7']	此經所明，章別十五。	此經所明，章別十五。	01a	What is clarified in this sutra is divided into fifteen chapters.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a06_11']	始從歎佛、終至勝鬘師子吼章，章雖十五，要分為二：	始從歎佛、終至勝鬘師子吼章，章雖十五，要分為二：	01a	Beginning from the praise of the Buddha to the chapter on Śrīmālā's lion's roar, although there are fifteen chapters, they can be divided into two:
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a07_6']	前十四章是自利行、後一利他。	前十四章是自利行、後一利他。	01a	The first fourteen chapters are the practice for one's own benefit, and the last one is for benefiting others.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a08_3']	今言勝鬘師子吼者，是第十五利他行。	今言勝鬘師子吼者，是第十五利他行。	01a	Now, Śrīmālā's lion's roar refers to the fifteenth chapter on benefiting others.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a09_3']	一乘大方便及與方廣，是前十四自利行也。	一乘大方便及與方廣，是前十四自利行也。	01a	The great skillful means of the One Vehicle and vaipulya are the first fourteen chapters on the practice for one's own benefit.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a10_10']	所以不次第者，彼後一章標人樹德，標人在初故前舉之。	所以不次第者，彼後一章標人樹德，標人在初故前舉之。	01a	The reason for not following the sequence is that the last chapter first establishes the person and then praises their virtues, so it is mentioned first.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a11_10']	一乘者即是第五，一乘大方便者是初四章。	一乘者即是第五，一乘大方便者是初四章。	01a	The One Vehicle refers to the fifth chapter, and the great skillful means of the One Vehicle refers to the first four chapters.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a12_4']	方廣者，即是無邊聖諦等章。	方廣者，即是無邊聖諦等章。	01a	Vaipulya refers to the chapters on the boundless noble truth and so forth.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:

First, it is difficult to understand based on this sutra, and second, the Sutra of Vimalakirti is used as a comparison.🔽If it is said that the later chapter of Simhanada in the Sutra of Sumedha is used as the title, then in the later establishment of the sutra name, Now I entrust this Sutra of Sumedha's Simhanada to you, it should also only be entrusted to a chapter of the sutra.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a17_16']	然後既通付一部，知今題勝鬘師子吼，亦通題一經。	然後既通付一部，知今題勝鬘師子吼，亦通題一經。	01a	Then, since the entire sutra is entrusted later, it is known that the current title of the Sutra of Sumedha's Simhanada is also the title of the entire sutra.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a19_1']	勝鬘師子吼既通一部，則一乘大方便等義亦同然。	勝鬘師子吼既通一部，則一乘大方便等義亦同然。	01a	Since the Sutra of Sumedha's Simhanada is the title of the entire sutra, the meaning of the Mahayana of great skillful means and so forth is also the same.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a21_6']	引淨名為類者，如維摩經一名不思議解脫，然彼非但詺〈不思議品〉以為不思議解脫，乃是通名一部。	引淨名為類者，如維摩經一名不思議解脫，然彼非但詺〈不思議品〉以為不思議解脫，乃是通名一部。	01a	As for citing the Sutra of Vimalakirti as a comparison, the Vimalakirti Sutra is also called the inconceivable liberation. However, it is not only named the inconceivable chapter as the inconceivable liberation, but it is the general name of the entire sutra.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a21_11']	故肇師言：	故肇師言：	01a	Therefore, Master ZHI said:
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a22_14']	「此經始自淨國、終于供養，其文雖殊，不思議一也。	「此經始自淨國、終于供養，其文雖殊，不思議一也。	01a	This sutra begins with the Pure Land and ends with making offerings. Although the texts are different, the inconceivable is one.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002a23_16']	」以彼類此，故知今言一乘，非唯詺一乘章以為一乘。	」以彼類此，故知今言一乘，非唯詺一乘章以為一乘。	01a	Using that to classify this, it can be known that the present statement of the One Vehicle is not only referring to the chapter on the One Vehicle as the One Vehicle.

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002b02_11']	從勝鬘師子吼至一乘大乘大方便謂一經之別名也，方廣者謂大乘經之通稱也，謂通別一雙。	從勝鬘師子吼至一乘大乘大方便謂一經之別名也，方廣者謂大乘經之通稱也，謂通別一雙。	01a	From Siṃha-prajñā's lion's roar to the great vehicle of the one vehicle, the great skillful means are the specific names of a single sūtra, while vaipulya is the general name for Mahāyāna sūtras, referring to a pair of general and specific.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002b03_18']	從勝鬘至方廣謂所詮之理也，經者能詮之教，謂理故一雙。	從勝鬘至方廣謂所詮之理也，經者能詮之教，謂理故一雙。	01a	From Siṃha-prajñā to vaipulya refers to the principle that is expounded, while sūtra refers to the teaching that can expound it, referring to a pair of principle and teaching.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002b04_10']	蓋是不二而二，故開五雙；	蓋是不二而二，故開五雙；	01a	This is not two but two, thus opening up five pairs;
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002b05_3']	若二而不二，則十義無別。	若二而不二，則十義無別。	01a	If it is two but not two, then the ten meanings are no different.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002b05_20']	故下章云「無異攝受、無異正法」也。	故下章云「無異攝受、無異正法」也。	01a	Therefore, the following chapter says no different acceptance, no different true Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0002b06_4']	今次第釋之。	今次第釋之。	01a	Now I will explain them in order.

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013b16_11']	接此一依，即明依藏有生死故是真實、不依藏有生死名為顛倒，故有顛倒真實章。	接此一依，即明依藏有生死故是真實、不依藏有生死名為顛倒，故有顛倒真實章。	01a	Following this one reliance, it is explained that there is birth and death based on the storehouse, so it is the truth. Not relying on the storehouse for birth and death is called inversion, so there is the chapter on inversion and truth.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013b17_18']	生死依藏所依是深，今欲明此義，故有自性清淨煩惱隱覆。	生死依藏所依是深，今欲明此義，故有自性清淨煩惱隱覆。	01a	The basis of birth and death relying on the storehouse is profound. Now, wanting to clarify this meaning, there is the naturally pure and concealed by afflictions.

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013b21_3']	若不信此法，則是外道種子非法惡人，宜須降伏，故有勝鬘師子吼章也。	若不信此法，則是外道種子非法惡人，宜須降伏，故有勝鬘師子吼章也。	01a	If one does not believe in this Dharma, then one is a seed of non-Buddhists and an evil person who is not in accord with the Dharma.

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013b25_3']	所以有此二者，勝鬘當今教主，機緣屬在其人，於前明說法。	所以有此二者，勝鬘當今教主，機緣屬在其人，於前明說法。	01a	The reason for having these two is that Śrīmālā is the current teacher, and the conditions and opportunities belong to her. The previous clarifies the teaching of the Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013b26_6']	說法既竟，則信之大益、毀之大損，故次明勸信守護。	說法既竟，則信之大益、毀之大損，故次明勸信守護。	01a	Since the teaching of the Dharma is completed, then the great benefit of faith and the great harm of slander, therefore, next, it clarifies the exhortation to have faith and guard and protect.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013b26_16']	就此兩章，各分為二。	就此兩章，各分為二。	01a	Within these two chapters, each is divided into two parts.

It is necessary to have three practices and three accomplishments, to stop slander, dispel doubt, respect the person and receive the way, and only then can it be expounded and taught.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013c01_15']	三行三成者，一歎佛發心，佛即授記；	三行三成者，一歎佛發心，佛即授記；	01a	As for the three practices and three accomplishments, first, praising the Buddha's arousal of the mind, the Buddha then bestows the prophecy;

['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013c04_15']	方便既成，然後開宗授道，故有第二次明正說。	方便既成，然後開宗授道，故有第二次明正說。	01a	Once the skillful means are accomplished, then the main teaching is revealed, so there is a second part that clarifies the correct explanation.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013c06_3']	後章二者，勝鬘說法既竟，佛欲令人信，故第一前明勸信。	後章二者，勝鬘說法既竟，佛欲令人信，故第一前明勸信。	01a	As for the two chapters later on, after Shrimala's Dharma explanation is finished, the Buddha wants people to have faith, so the first part clarifies encouraging faith.
['ZH_T37_1744_01a:0013c07_16']	如來既明信法有益，勝鬘則明不信為損、宜須摧伏，故第二次明護法也。	如來既明信法有益，勝鬘則明不信為損、宜須摧伏，故第二次明護法也。	01a	Since the Tathagata clarifies that having faith in the Dharma is beneficial, Shrimala then clarifies that lack of faith is harmful and should be suppressed, so the second part clarifies protecting the Dharma.
