['ZH_T36_1736_082:0647a17_19']	謂由聖者得初果已，斷欲修惑起大加行，必無未斷一大品三品名二大品也，有死生故。	謂由聖者得初果已，斷欲修惑起大加行，必無未斷一大品三品名二大品也，有死生故。	082	This is because the noble ones, having attained the first fruit, sever the afflictions to be eliminated in the path of cultivation and give rise to great effort, but there is no one who has not yet severed one large stage or three stages called two large stages, because there is death and rebirth.
['ZH_T36_1736_082:0647a18_10']	故斷一品二品必斷三品也。	故斷一品二品必斷三品也。	082	Therefore, severing one or two stages definitely severs three stages.
['ZH_T36_1736_082:0647a20_15']	斷第五品不斷第六品者，謂第六品證一來果，以無一品能障得果，故斷五品必斷第六。	斷第五品不斷第六品者，謂第六品證一來果，以無一品能障得果，故斷五品必斷第六。	082	As for severing the fifth stage but not severing the sixth stage, this refers to one who attains the fruit of once-returning by severing the sixth stage, because no single stage can obstruct the attainment of the fruit, so severing five stages definitely severs the sixth.

The path of seeing must be that which was not seen before but is now seen. Therefore, since the path has already been seen, one then repeatedly contemplates and practices, and it is called the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T36_1736_082:0647a27_2']	《智度論》意，至第十六是解脫道，斷惑方終、見諦始圓，故名見地。	《智度論》意，至第十六是解脫道，斷惑方終、見諦始圓，故名見地。	082	The intention of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra is that the sixteenth [mind] is the path of liberation, and the elimination of afflictions is only completed at this point, and the seeing of the truth is only perfected at this point, and therefore it is called the stage of seeing.

A previous verse from the Abhidharma-kośa states: Under the truth of suffering, all are present. Under the truths of accumulation and cessation, three views are absent. Under the truth of the path, two views are absent. In the upper realms, anger is absent.
