['ZH_T34_1723_07a:0782b07_5']	或教能順理、理能順行、行能順果，故到佛地，一切智者是佛智故。	或教能順理、理能順行、行能順果，故到佛地，一切智者是佛智故。	Or, the teachings can accord with principle, principle can accord with practice, and practice can accord with fruition, thus reaching the stage of buddhahood, because the knowledge of all modes is the wisdom of the Buddha.

['ZH_T34_1723_07a:0782b16_2']	此上意言，所說契智境識法空有性，解生心行所應學道，故能示眾生佛之智慧令其歸入。	此上意言，所說契智境識法空有性，解生心行所應學道，故能示眾生佛之智慧令其歸入。	The above-mentioned intention is to explain the realm of wisdom, the dharmas of consciousness, emptiness, existence, nature, understanding, arising, mental activities, the path to be learned, and thus to be able to show sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom and cause them to return to it.
['ZH_T34_1723_07a:0782b17_3']	由此四義所說不虛，所說不虛故佛智無邊。	由此四義所說不虛，所說不虛故佛智無邊。	Because of these four meanings, what is said is not false. Because what is said is not false, the Buddha's wisdom is boundless.

Therefore, the two trees are combined to divide them into three grades.
