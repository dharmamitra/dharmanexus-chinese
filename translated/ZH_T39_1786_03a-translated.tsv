Therefore, Shakyamuni fully expounds the three bodies, namely the Dharma body, the reward body, and the transformation body.
['ZH_T39_1786_03a:0110a26_1']	如依空有電、依電有光。	如依空有電、依電有光。	Like lightning exists in the sky and light exists in lightning.

The three bodies merge into one, but one is not fixed as one. The three bodies are distinct. Therefore, the chapter title is Distinguishing the Three Bodies.
['ZH_T39_1786_03a:0110a29_7']	法應是本，化身是迹，一時俱說則生妙解，思議乃絕。	法應是本，化身是迹，一時俱說則生妙解，思議乃絕。	The Dharma and the response body are the basis, and the transformation body is the trace. Explaining them simultaneously gives rise to wondrous understanding, and conceptual thought is then cut off.

If they are able to repent, praise, and cultivate the two emptinesses, then the wondrous function of the Buddha arises completely in its entirety, enabling these sentient beings to destroy evil, give rise to goodness, and give rise to the function of emptiness to guide and accomplish the two functions. Therefore, it is said that the three chapters are all the function of the sūtra.

Therefore, Master Tanxu, in accordance with the preference for concise methods, did not translate the last two.

['ZH_T39_1786_03a:0110b15_6']	今此室中有三乘眾，三中菩薩利根之者能深觀空，見不空理。	今此室中有三乘眾，三中菩薩利根之者能深觀空，見不空理。	Now, in this room there are assemblies of the Three Vehicles. Among the three, the bodhisattvas with sharp faculties are able to deeply contemplate emptiness and see the principle of non-emptiness.
['ZH_T39_1786_03a:0110b15_20']	不空理者，乃是生佛同一覺性。	不空理者，乃是生佛同一覺性。	The principle of non-emptiness is the same enlightened nature shared by sentient beings and Buddhas.

Whether following the great or the small, all are boundless. Therefore, it is said that the four Buddhas have the same majestic body. The body, wisdom, and application are one and eternal. How can it be that not only are the Buddhas non-dual and without distinction?
['ZH_T39_1786_03a:0110b19_1']	與其弟子亦復不異，故云眾一。	與其弟子亦復不異，故云眾一。	They are also no different from their disciples. Therefore, it is said that the assembly is one.

Grasping at the limited appearance, they are only the responsive transformations. The Buddhas are still each different, so how can their disciples be the same?
