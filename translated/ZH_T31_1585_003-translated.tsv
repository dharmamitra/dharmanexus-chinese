['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b16_8']	此識與幾心所相應？	此識與幾心所相應？	With how many mental factors is this consciousness associated?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b17_1']	常與觸、作意、受、想、思相應。	常與觸、作意、受、想、思相應。	It is always associated with contact, attention, feeling, conceptualization, and volition.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b19_1']	阿賴耶識無始時來乃至未轉，於一切位恒與此五心所相應，以是遍行心所攝故。	阿賴耶識無始時來乃至未轉，於一切位恒與此五心所相應，以是遍行心所攝故。	From beginningless time until it has not yet transformed, the ālaya consciousness is always associated with these five mental factors in all states, because they are categorized as universal mental factors.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b20_12']	觸謂三和分別變異令心心所觸境為性，受、想、思等所依為業。	觸謂三和分別變異令心心所觸境為性，受、想、思等所依為業。	Contact refers to the transformation of the three harmonizations and discrimination, which causes the mind and mental factors to contact the object as their nature, and whose activity is to serve as the support for feeling, conceptualization, volition, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b21_6']	謂根、境、識更相隨順，故名三和。	謂根、境、識更相隨順，故名三和。	It is called the three harmonizations because the faculties, objects, and consciousnesses mutually accord with each other.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b22_1']	觸依彼生，令彼和合，故說為彼。	觸依彼生，令彼和合，故說為彼。	Contact arises in dependence on them and causes them to harmonize, so it is called those.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b23_1']	三和合位皆有順生心所功能，說名變異。	三和合位皆有順生心所功能，說名變異。	In the state of the three harmonizations, there is the power to give rise to mental factors, which is called transformation.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b23_11']	觸似彼起，故名分別。	觸似彼起，故名分別。	Contact arises resembling that, so it is called discrimination.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b26_1']	根變異力引觸起時，勝彼識境，故《集論》等但說分別根之變異，和合一切心及心所令同觸境，是觸自性。	根變異力引觸起時，勝彼識境，故《集論》等但說分別根之變異，和合一切心及心所令同觸境，是觸自性。	When contact arises through the power of the transformation of the organs, it is superior to the object of consciousness. Therefore the Abhidharmasamuccaya and other texts say that contact is the transformation of the organ, and it is the harmonization of all mind and mental activities that causes them to contact the object. This is the nature of contact.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b27_1']	既似順起心所功能，故以受等所依為業。	既似順起心所功能，故以受等所依為業。	Since it is similar to the power of mental activities that are about to arise, its activity is that of supporting feeling, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b28_1']	《起盡經》說受、想、行蘊一切皆以觸為緣故。	《起盡經》說受、想、行蘊一切皆以觸為緣故。	The Sutra of Birth and Extinction says, All the aggregates of feeling, conceptualization, and karmic forces are caused by contact.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011b29_1', 'ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c01_10', 'ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c02_11']	由斯故說識觸受等因二三四和合而生。🔽《瑜伽》但說與受想思為所依者，思於行蘊為主，勝故舉此攝餘。🔽《集論》等說為受依者，以觸生受近而勝故。	由斯故說識觸受等因二三四和合而生。 《瑜伽》但說與受想思為所依者，思於行蘊為主，勝故舉此攝餘。 《集論》等說為受依者，以觸生受近而勝故。	Therefore it is said that consciousness, contact, feeling, etc., are born from the union of two, three, or four conditions.🔽The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that contact supports feeling, conceptualization, and volition, but volition is the most important in the aggregate of karmic forces, and therefore it is mentioned and includes the others.🔽The Abhidharmasamuccaya says that contact is the support of feeling, because contact is the proximate and most important cause of the arising of feeling.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c04_1']	謂觸所取可意等相，與受所取順益等相，極相隣近，引發勝故。	謂觸所取可意等相，與受所取順益等相，極相隣近，引發勝故。	That is, the characteristics of agreeableness, etc., grasped by contact are extremely close to the characteristics of benefit, etc., grasped by feeling, and contact is the most important in arousing feeling.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c05_18']	然觸自性是實非假，六六法中心所性故，是食攝故，能為緣故，如受等性非即三和。	然觸自性是實非假，六六法中心所性故，是食攝故，能為緣故，如受等性非即三和。	However, the substance of contact is real and not nominal, because it is a mental activity included among the six kinds of six mental activities, because it is categorized as nutriment, and because it can be a condition, just as feeling, etc., is not simply the three as a combination.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c06_17']	作意謂能警心為性，於所緣境引心為業。	作意謂能警心為性，於所緣境引心為業。	ATTENTION is the alerting of mind as its nature, and its activity is that of directing mind to an object.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c07_17']	謂此警覺應起心種引令趣境，故名作意。	謂此警覺應起心種引令趣境，故名作意。	It is called attention because it alerts the kind of mind that should be produced and directs it to an object.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c08_17']	雖此亦能引起心所，心是主故但說引心。	雖此亦能引起心所，心是主故但說引心。	Even though it also can stimulate mental activities, mind is the principal factor and therefore it is said that attention directs mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c10_6']	有說令心迴趣異境，或於一境持心令住，故名作意。	有說令心迴趣異境，或於一境持心令住，故名作意。	There is an opinion that attention causes mind to turn to a different object or holds mind to the same object, and for that reason it is called attention.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c11_2', 'ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c12_2']	彼俱非理，應非遍行，不異定故。🔽受謂領納順違俱非境相為性，起愛為業。	彼俱非理，應非遍行，不異定故。 受謂領納順違俱非境相為性，起愛為業。	Both of these are unreasonable, because attention would not be universal, because it would not be different from samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c12_12']	能起合離，非二欲故。	能起合離，非二欲故。	FEELING has the nature of experiencing objects that are in accordance with, contrary to, or indifferent to the passions, and its activity is that of arousing craving, because it can arouse the desires for union, separation, or neither one.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c13_2', 'ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c13_12']	有作是說，受有二種：🔽一境界受，謂領所緣；	有作是說，受有二種： 一境界受，謂領所緣；	There is an opinion that there are two kinds of feeling:🔽one is feeling with an object, that is, experiencing the object;
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c14_2']	二自性受，謂領俱觸。	二自性受，謂領俱觸。	and the other is feeling with a nature, that is, experiencing the contact that accompanies it.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c15_1']	唯自性受是受自相，以境界受共餘相故。	唯自性受是受自相，以境界受共餘相故。	Only the nature of feeling is the specific characteristic of feeling, because the feeling of an object is a common characteristic with other dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c15_15']	彼說非理，受定不緣俱生觸故。	彼說非理，受定不緣俱生觸故。	This explanation is unreasonable, because feeling definitely does not have as an object the contact that occurs simultaneously with it.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c16_14']	若似觸生名領觸者，似因之果應皆受性。	若似觸生名領觸者，似因之果應皆受性。	If it is said that feeling is named after contact because it arises resembling contact, then the effect that resembles a cause should all be of the nature of feeling.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c17_14']	又既受因，應名因受，何名自性？	又既受因，應名因受，何名自性？	Also, if feeling is named after its cause, it should be named causal feeling, not feeling by nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c18_17']	若謂如王食諸國邑，受能領觸所生受體名自性受。	若謂如王食諸國邑，受能領觸所生受體名自性受。	If it is said that feeling is named after its object, contact, just as a king is said to eat the food of his country, then the substance of feeling generated by contact is named feeling by nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c19_14']	理亦不然，違自所執，不自證故。	理亦不然，違自所執，不自證故。	This is also unreasonable, because it contradicts the accepted doctrine that feeling does not experience itself.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c21_7']	若不捨自性名自性受，應一切法皆是受自性，故彼所說但誘嬰兒。	若不捨自性名自性受，應一切法皆是受自性，故彼所說但誘嬰兒。	If it is said that feeling is named after its own nature, and not after something else, then all dharmas should be named feeling by nature. Therefore the above explanation is merely an enticement to infants.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c22_16']	然境界受非共餘相，領順等相定屬己者名境界受，不共餘故。	然境界受非共餘相，領順等相定屬己者名境界受，不共餘故。	However, the feeling of an object is not a common characteristic with other dharmas, because it is named after its object. The feeling of an object is named after the object that is pleasant, etc., and is not common to other dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c23_16']	想謂於境取像為性，施設種種名言為業。	想謂於境取像為性，施設種種名言為業。	Vijnana means to cognize, to discriminate, to distinguish, to discern, to perceive, to be conscious of, to be aware of, to know, to understand, to recognize, to realize, to comprehend, to grasp, to apprehend, to take as an object, to take as a support, to take as a basis, to take as a foundation, to take as a cause, to take as a condition, to take as a root, to take as a source, to take as a beginning, to take as a basis, to take as a support, to take as a foundation, to take as a cause, to take as a condition, to take as a root, to take as a source, to take as a beginning, to take as a basis, to take as a support, to take as a foundation, to take as a cause, to take as a condition, to take as a root, to take as a source, to take as a beginning, to take as a basis, to take as a support, to take as a foundation, to take as a cause, to take as a condition, to take as a root, to take as a source, to take
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c24_16']	謂要安立境分齊相，方能隨起種種名言。	謂要安立境分齊相，方能隨起種種名言。	That is, it is necessary to establish the characteristics of the divisions of the object before one can give rise to various names and expressions.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c25_15']	思謂令心造作為性，於善品等役心為業。	思謂令心造作為性，於善品等役心為業。	Volition has as its nature the activity of making the mind act, and its activity is that of directing the mind to good things, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c26_16']	謂能取境正因等相，驅役自心令造善等。	謂能取境正因等相，驅役自心令造善等。	That is, it grasps the characteristics of the proper causes, etc., of the object and directs the mind to good, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c27_16']	此五既是遍行所攝，故與藏識決定相應。	此五既是遍行所攝，故與藏識決定相應。	Since these five are included in the universal mental activities, they are definitely associated with the store consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c28_7']	其遍行相後當廣釋。	其遍行相後當廣釋。	The characteristics of the universals will be discussed later.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0011c29_16', 'ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a02_15']	此觸等五與異熟識行相雖異，而時依同所緣事等，故名相應。🔽此識行相極不明了，不能分別違順境相，微細一類相續而轉，是故唯與捨受相應。	此觸等五與異熟識行相雖異，而時依同所緣事等，故名相應。 此識行相極不明了，不能分別違順境相，微細一類相續而轉，是故唯與捨受相應。	Although these five, such as contact, differ from the mode of activity of the consciousness that is retribution, they are the same as it in terms of time, support, object, etc., and for that reason they are called associated.🔽The mode of activity of this consciousness is extremely unclear and cannot discriminate a favorable or adverse object. It is subtle, of a single species, and continues in a series. For that reason, it is associated only with the feeling of indifference.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a04_13']	又此相應受唯是異熟，隨先引業轉，不待現緣，住善惡業勢力轉故，唯是捨受。	又此相應受唯是異熟，隨先引業轉，不待現緣，住善惡業勢力轉故，唯是捨受。	Moreover, the feeling associated with this consciousness is only retribution, evolving in accordance with a former action that has attracted it. It does not depend on a present condition, evolving by the power of good or bad action, and for that reason it is only the feeling of indifference.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a05_19']	苦樂二受是異熟生，非真異熟，待現緣故，非此相應。	苦樂二受是異熟生，非真異熟，待現緣故，非此相應。	The two feelings of pain and pleasure are born of retribution, not true retribution, because they depend on present conditions. They are not associated with this consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a06_17']	又由此識常無轉變，有情恒執為自內我。	又由此識常無轉變，有情恒執為自內我。	Also, because this consciousness is always without transformation, sentient beings always grasp it as their inner self.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a07_18']	若與苦樂二受相應，便有轉變，寧執為我？	若與苦樂二受相應，便有轉變，寧執為我？	If it were associated with the two feelings of pain and pleasure, it would have transformation and how could it be grasped as self?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a08_8']	故此但與捨受相應。	故此但與捨受相應。	Therefore it is only associated with the feeling of indifference.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a09_3']	若爾，如何此識亦是惡業異熟？	若爾，如何此識亦是惡業異熟？	If that is so, how can this consciousness be the retribution of bad action?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a10_16']	既許善業能招捨受，此亦應然，捨受不違苦樂品故，如無記法善惡俱招。	既許善業能招捨受，此亦應然，捨受不違苦樂品故，如無記法善惡俱招。	Since it is admitted that good action can attract the feeling of indifference, this also should be so, because the feeling of indifference does not conflict with the categories of pain and pleasure, just as indeterminate dharmas can be attracted by good and bad action.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a11_7']	如何此識非別境等？	如何此識非別境等？	How can this consciousness not be associated with mental activities such as the objects of volition, etc.?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a11_16']	心所相應互相違故。	心所相應互相違故。	Because the characteristics of mental activities are mutually contradictory when associated with mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a12_15']	謂欲希望所樂事轉，此識任運無所希望。	謂欲希望所樂事轉，此識任運無所希望。	That is, desire evolves as the hope for something pleasurable, but this consciousness is spontaneous and has nothing to do with hope.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a13_16']	勝解印持決定事轉，此識瞢昧無所印持。	勝解印持決定事轉，此識瞢昧無所印持。	Volition evolves as the determination of something definite, but this consciousness is confused and has nothing to do with determination.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a14_16']	念唯明記曾習事轉，此識昧劣不能明記。	念唯明記曾習事轉，此識昧劣不能明記。	Memory only clearly remembers something already experienced, but this consciousness is weak and dull and cannot clearly remember.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a15_16']	定能令心專注一境，此識任運剎那別緣。	定能令心專注一境，此識任運剎那別緣。	Concentration causes the mind to be fixed on a single object, but this consciousness is spontaneous and discriminates objects from instant to instant.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a16_15']	慧唯簡擇德等事轉，此識微昧不能簡擇。	慧唯簡擇德等事轉，此識微昧不能簡擇。	Discernment only evolves by discriminating such things as virtue, but this consciousness is subtle and dull and is incapable of discriminating.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a17_6']	故此不與別境相應。	故此不與別境相應。	Therefore it is not associated with the specific mental activities.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a18_6']	此識唯是異熟性故，善染污等亦不相應。	此識唯是異熟性故，善染污等亦不相應。	This consciousness is only retribution by nature, and therefore it is also not associated with the good, impure dharmas, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a19_7']	惡作等四無記性者，有間斷故，定非異熟。	惡作等四無記性者，有間斷故，定非異熟。	The four indeterminate dharmas such as remorse, etc., are sometimes interrupted and therefore definitely are not retribution.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a20_16']	法有四種，謂善、不善、有覆無記、無覆無記，阿賴耶識何法攝耶？	法有四種，謂善、不善、有覆無記、無覆無記，阿賴耶識何法攝耶？	Dharmas are of four kinds, i.e., good, bad, indeterminate and obscured, and indeterminate and unobscured. To which class does the ālaya consciousness belong?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a21_10']	此識唯是無覆無記，異熟性故。	此識唯是無覆無記，異熟性故。	This consciousness is only indeterminate and unobscured, because it is by nature retribution.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a22_8']	異熟若是善染污者，流轉還滅應不得成。	異熟若是善染污者，流轉還滅應不得成。	If retribution were good or defiled, then the process of saṃsāra could not occur.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a23_17']	又此識是善染依故，若善染者互相違故，應不與二俱作所依。	又此識是善染依故，若善染者互相違故，應不與二俱作所依。	Also, this consciousness is the support of good and defiled dharmas, and if it were itself good or defiled, it would be in contradiction with the dharmas it supports, and it could not act as their support.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a25_16']	又此識是所熏性故，若善染者，如極香臭應不受熏，無熏習故染淨因果俱不成立。	又此識是所熏性故，若善染者，如極香臭應不受熏，無熏習故染淨因果俱不成立。	Also, this consciousness is the substance that is perfumed. If it were good or soiled, like something with a very strong odor, it would not be perfumable, because there would be no perfuming. Consequently, the cause and effect of purity and defilement would not be established.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a26_8']	故此唯是無覆無記。	故此唯是無覆無記。	Therefore this consciousness is only nondetermined and indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a27_8']	覆謂染法，障聖道故，又能蔽心令不淨故。	覆謂染法，障聖道故，又能蔽心令不淨故。	Determined means defiled dharmas, because they obstruct the holy path and can also cover the mind and prevent its purity.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a27_18']	此識非染，故名無覆。	此識非染，故名無覆。	This consciousness is not defiled, and for that reason it is called nondetermined.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a29_2']	記謂善惡，有愛非愛果及殊勝自體可記別故。	記謂善惡，有愛非愛果及殊勝自體可記別故。	Determinate means good and bad, because it is possible to determine that they have desirable or undesirable results and a superior nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012a29_12', 'ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b03_2']	此非善惡，故名無記。🔽觸等亦如是者，謂如阿賴耶識唯是無覆無記性攝，觸作意受想思亦爾，諸相應法必同性故。	此非善惡，故名無記。 觸等亦如是者，謂如阿賴耶識唯是無覆無記性攝，觸作意受想思亦爾，諸相應法必同性故。	This consciousness is neither good nor bad, and for that reason it is called indeterminate.🔽The same is true of contact, etc. means that, just as the ālaya consciousness is categorized as nondetermined and indeterminate, so also are contact, attention, feeling, conceptualization, and volition, because associated dharmas must be of the same nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b05_10']	又觸等五如阿賴耶，亦是異熟，所緣行相俱不可知，緣三種境五法相應，無覆無記，故說觸等亦如是言。	又觸等五如阿賴耶，亦是異熟，所緣行相俱不可知，緣三種境五法相應，無覆無記，故說觸等亦如是言。	Also, the five dharmas such as contact are, like the ālaya consciousness, retribution, and their objects and modes of activity are both unknowable, they have three kinds of objects, they are associated with five dharmas, and they are nondetermined and indeterminate. Therefore the text says that the same is true of contact, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b06_19']	有義，觸等如阿賴耶，亦是異熟及一切種，廣說乃至無覆無記。	有義，觸等如阿賴耶，亦是異熟及一切種，廣說乃至無覆無記。	There is an interpretation by Sthiramati that contact, etc., like the store consciousness, are both results and seeds, and so on, up to the conclusion that they are morally indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b07_9']	亦如是言，無簡別故。	亦如是言，無簡別故。	The words “and so on” in the above passage are not specific.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b07_14']	彼說非理。	彼說非理。	This interpretation is incorrect.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b07_19']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it incorrect?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b09_10']	觸等依識，不自在故，如貪信等不能受熏，如何同識能持種子？	觸等依識，不自在故，如貪信等不能受熏，如何同識能持種子？	Because contact, etc., are not independent of consciousness and, like craving and faith, etc., cannot be perfumed. How can they be the same as consciousness in being able to hold seeds?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b10_10']	又若觸等亦能受熏，應一有情有六種體。	又若觸等亦能受熏，應一有情有六種體。	Also, if contact, etc., can be perfumed, then a single sentient being would have six natures.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0012b11_1']	若爾果起從何種生？	若爾果起從何種生？	If that were so, from which seed would a result be produced?

['ZH_T31_1585_003:0016c24_3']	又契經說，諸有情類受生命終，必住散心，非無心定。	又契經說，諸有情類受生命終，必住散心，非無心定。	Also, a scripture says that when sentient beings receive life or end a life, they definitely do so in a distracted state of mind, not in a mindless state.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0016c24_17']	若無此識，生死時心不應有故。	若無此識，生死時心不應有故。	If this eighth consciousness did not exist, there would be no mind at the time of birth or death.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0016c26_7']	謂生死時身心惽昧，如睡無夢極悶絕時，明了轉識必不現起。	謂生死時身心惽昧，如睡無夢極悶絕時，明了轉識必不現起。	This is because the body and mind are confused and dull at the time of birth and death, as when one is asleep and dreaming, or in a faint. The active forms of consciousness cannot appear.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0016c27_16']	又此位中六種轉識行相所緣不可知故，如無心位，必不現行。	又此位中六種轉識行相所緣不可知故，如無心位，必不現行。	Also, the mode of activity and objects of the six forms of consciousness are not known in this state, just as they are not known in a mindless state. They definitely do not appear.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0016c28_15']	六種轉識行相所緣有必可知，如餘時故。	六種轉識行相所緣有必可知，如餘時故。	This is because the mode of activity and objects of the six forms of consciousness are definitely known, as they are at other times.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a02_6']	真異熟識極微細故，行相所緣俱不可了，是引業果一期相續，恒無轉變，是散有心，名生死心，不違正理。	真異熟識極微細故，行相所緣俱不可了，是引業果一期相續，恒無轉變，是散有心，名生死心，不違正理。	The true consciousness as retribution is extremely subtle, and its mode of activity and objects are both unknowable. It is the result of the projecting cause, continues in a series for a period of time, and is always without change. It is a distracted mind with thought, and is called the mind of birth and death. This does not contradict correct reasoning.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a04_15']	有說五識此位定無意識取境，或因五識、或因他教、或定為因，生位諸因既不可得，故受生位意識亦無。	有說五識此位定無意識取境，或因五識、或因他教、或定為因，生位諸因既不可得，故受生位意識亦無。	Some say that the five consciousnesses are definitely absent in this state, and that manas takes the store consciousness as its object. Manas is not born from its similar and immediately antecedent condition, because the five consciousnesses are absent. It is not born from its cause as retribution, because the other four consciousnesses are absent. It is not born from the cause of added effort, because the other six consciousnesses are absent. It is not born from a special transformation, because it is always of one species. Therefore manas does not exist in the state of rebirth.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a05_14']	若爾，有情生無色界，後時意識應永不生。	若爾，有情生無色界，後時意識應永不生。	If this is so, then manas will never be born again in the formless realms.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a07_4']	定心必由散意識引，五識他教彼界必無，引定散心無由起故。	定心必由散意識引，五識他教彼界必無，引定散心無由起故。	This is because a concentrated mind must be attracted by a distracted manas, and the five consciousnesses and the teaching of others are definitely absent in those realms. There is no reason for the arising of a concentrated mind that is attracted by a distracted mind.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a08_13']	若謂彼定由串習力，後時率爾能現在前，彼初生時寧不現起？	若謂彼定由串習力，後時率爾能現在前，彼初生時寧不現起？	If you say that a concentrated mind is attracted by a manas that is spontaneous and not attracted, because of the power of frequent practice, why does it not appear at the moment of rebirth?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a09_12']	又欲色界初受生時，串習意識亦應現起。	又欲色界初受生時，串習意識亦應現起。	Also, at the moment of rebirth in the realms of desire and form, manas that is attracted by a spontaneous mind must appear.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a10_13']	若由惛昧初未現前，此即前因，何勞別說？	若由惛昧初未現前，此即前因，何勞別說？	If you say that it does not appear because of the dullness of the mind at that time, this is the same as the previous reason, so why bother to mention it separately?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a12_2']	有餘部執，生死等位別有一類微細意識，行相所緣俱不可了。	有餘部執，生死等位別有一類微細意識，行相所緣俱不可了。	Another school holds the view that in the states of birth and death, etc., there is a special kind of subtle manas whose mode of activity and objects are both imperceptible.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a13_8']	應知即是此第八識，極成意識不如是故。	應知即是此第八識，極成意識不如是故。	You should know that this is the eighth consciousness, because the extremely well known mental consciousness is not like this.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a14_17']	又將死時，由善惡業下上身分冷觸漸起，若無此識彼事不成。	又將死時，由善惡業下上身分冷觸漸起，若無此識彼事不成。	Also, when death is imminent, cold sensations gradually appear in the upper or lower parts of the body due to good or bad karma. If this consciousness did not exist, this event would not occur.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a16_4']	轉識不能執受身故，眼等五識各別依故或不行故。	轉識不能執受身故，眼等五識各別依故或不行故。	Because the evolving consciousnesses are unable to grasp the body, because the five consciousnesses of eye, etc., have separate supports, and because they do not always exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a18_13']	第六意識不住身故，境不定故，遍寄身中恒相續故，不應冷觸由彼漸生。	第六意識不住身故，境不定故，遍寄身中恒相續故，不應冷觸由彼漸生。	Because the sixth, mental, consciousness does not dwell in the body, because its objects are not fixed, and because it is always present in the body, cold sensations cannot gradually arise from it.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a20_4']	唯異熟心，由先業力恒遍相續執受身分，捨執受處冷觸便生。	唯異熟心，由先業力恒遍相續執受身分，捨執受處冷觸便生。	Only the retributive consciousness, by the power of previous karma, is always present everywhere, grasps the body, and when it abandons its grasping, cold sensations appear.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a21_3']	壽煖識三不相離故，冷觸起處即是非情。	壽煖識三不相離故，冷觸起處即是非情。	Because life, heat, and consciousness are inseparable, where cold sensations appear, there is no longer sentience.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a22_3']	雖變亦緣而不執受，故知定有此第八識。	雖變亦緣而不執受，故知定有此第八識。	Even though the body is transformed and is its object, it is not grasped. Therefore you must know that this eighth consciousness definitely exists.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a24_13']	又契經說，識緣名色，名色緣識，如是二法展轉相依，譬如蘆束俱時而轉。	又契經說，識緣名色，名色緣識，如是二法展轉相依，譬如蘆束俱時而轉。	A scripture says, Consciousness conditions name-and-form, and name-and-form conditions consciousness. These two dharmas are mutually supportive, like a bundle of reeds floating on the water, one supporting the other.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a25_8']	若無此識，彼識自體不應有故。	若無此識，彼識自體不應有故。	If this eighth consciousness did not exist, that consciousness would not exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a26_13']	謂彼經中自作是釋，名謂非色四蘊，色謂羯邏藍等。	謂彼經中自作是釋，名謂非色四蘊，色謂羯邏藍等。	The scripture itself explains that name refers to the four nonmaterial aggregates, and form refers to the kalala, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a28_2']	此二與識相依而住，如二蘆束更互為緣，恒俱時轉不相捨離。	此二與識相依而住，如二蘆束更互為緣，恒俱時轉不相捨離。	These two, together with consciousness, support each other and exist like two bundles of reeds supporting each other, always occurring together and never separating.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017a29_2']	眼等轉識攝在名中，此識若無，說誰為識？	眼等轉識攝在名中，此識若無，說誰為識？	The evolving consciousnesses are included in name, and if this eighth consciousness did not exist, what consciousness would be referred to?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017b01_11']	亦不可說名中識蘊謂五識身，識謂第六，羯邏藍時無五識故。	亦不可說名中識蘊謂五識身，識謂第六，羯邏藍時無五識故。	It cannot be said that the aggregate of consciousness in name refers to the five material forms of consciousness, and consciousness refers to the sixth consciousness, because at the moment of the kalala, etc., the five material forms of consciousness are not yet present.
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017b03_2']	又諸轉識有間轉故，無力恒時執持名色，寧說恒與名色為緣？	又諸轉識有間轉故，無力恒時執持名色，寧說恒與名色為緣？	Also, because the evolving consciousnesses are interrupted, they do not have the power to grasp and hold name and form at all times, so how can they be said to be conditions for name and form at all times?
['ZH_T31_1585_003:0017b03_11']	故彼識言顯第八識。	故彼識言顯第八識。	Therefore the word consciousness in the above passage refers to the eighth consciousness.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
