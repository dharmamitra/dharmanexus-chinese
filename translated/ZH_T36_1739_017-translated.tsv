Based on the fundamental wisdom, faith is born, and based on fundamental wisdom, one awakens to it.

In the ninth abode, the state of Dharma master, compassion and wisdom are perfectly fulfilled. The characteristics of practice in these five stages are similar.

However, in order to demonstrate that the Dharma of the supreme Dharma of the great wisdom and great compassion is inexhaustible, it is necessary to establish the practices of the five stages. In total, it is the path of practice that is universally filled with the one mind, the one wisdom, and the wisdom of the one time.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834a16_1']	是故起信進修行者，於大智境界莫作三世遠近延促之見，違智境界故。	是故起信進修行者，於大智境界莫作三世遠近延促之見，違智境界故。	Therefore, practitioners who arouse faith and progress in practice, in the realm of great wisdom, should not have views of the distant and near, long and short of the three times, because this goes against the realm of wisdom.

Using the perfect mirror of great wisdom, it universally imprints all activities, and none of them do not become the great function without function, therefore it is the one time without the three times.

['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b11_7']	此十住位中，已生諸佛智慧家故，下名悉同名之為慧，明入聖法流中得佛智慧，同佛知見，善簡正邪契會正法，名之法慧也。	此十住位中，已生諸佛智慧家故，下名悉同名之為慧，明入聖法流中得佛智慧，同佛知見，善簡正邪契會正法，名之法慧也。	In this stage of the ten abodes, since one has already been born into the family of the Buddhas' wisdom, the following names are all called wisdom. It clarifies that entering the stream of the true Dharma, one attains the Buddhas' wisdom and the same insight as the Buddhas, and is able to skillfully distinguish right from wrong and harmonize with the true Dharma, which is called Dharma Wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b12_14']	自己不能同諸佛智慧知見者，自邪未明，焉能簡他邪見也。	自己不能同諸佛智慧知見者，自邪未明，焉能簡他邪見也。	If one oneself is not able to be the same as the Buddhas in wisdom and insight, one's own wrong views are not yet clear, so how can one distinguish the wrong views of others?
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b15_5']	是故此位能同一切諸佛知見故，得一切同名法慧佛而現其前以為印信，定其詮表也，以與十方諸佛智慧同故。	是故此位能同一切諸佛知見故，得一切同名法慧佛而現其前以為印信，定其詮表也，以與十方諸佛智慧同故。	Therefore, in this stage, one is able to be the same as all the Buddhas in wisdom and insight, so one attains all the Buddhas with the same name Dharma Wisdom appearing before one as a seal of confirmation, determining the expression, because one is the same as the wisdom of the Buddhas of the ten directions.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b18_8']	二明入三昧之意者，如十信位中，且以生滅心，信自心所有無始無明能分別心，便即信為自心根本不動智佛，未有方便三昧合其體用故。	二明入三昧之意者，如十信位中，且以生滅心，信自心所有無始無明能分別心，便即信為自心根本不動智佛，未有方便三昧合其體用故。	Second, clarifying the meaning of entering samādhi: In the stage of the ten faiths, one simply uses the mind of arising and ceasing to believe that the beginningless ignorance that can discriminate the mind one possesses is one's own fundamental immovable wisdom Buddha. One has not yet had the samādhi of skillful means to unite its essence and function.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b20_15']	是故十信位中十箇世界皆名為色，為十信未入法性之流，以生滅心而信解故，故十箇世界名之為色。	是故十信位中十箇世界皆名為色，為十信未入法性之流，以生滅心而信解故，故十箇世界名之為色。	Therefore, in the stage of the ten faiths, the ten worlds are all called form, because the ten faiths have not yet entered the stream of the Dharma-nature, and they believe and understand with a mind of birth and cessation, so the ten worlds are called form.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b22_5']	如此十住位中，以方便三昧無沈掉心，能現自體無生滅智慧故。	如此十住位中，以方便三昧無沈掉心，能現自體無生滅智慧故。	In this way, in the stage of the ten abodes, with the samādhi of skillful means and a mind free from sinking and agitation, one is able to manifest one's own unborn wisdom of no arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b25_3']	是故一切修道者，初以聞解信入，次以無思契同，依本無作用之本智慧故須入三昧，以淨攀緣染習力故，無作真智方明現故。	是故一切修道者，初以聞解信入，次以無思契同，依本無作用之本智慧故須入三昧，以淨攀緣染習力故，無作真智方明現故。	Therefore, all practitioners of the path first enter by believing and understanding what they hear, next they accord with it without thought, and rely on the fundamental wisdom of no action. Therefore, they must enter samādhi, because the power of defiled habits of pure clinging causes the true wisdom of no-action to manifest.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b25_13']	以是義故，須入三昧。	以是義故，須入三昧。	For this reason, it is necessary to enter samādhi.

['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834b29_1']	無欣無厭，任性無思、任理不作，智自明矣，是名方便、是名無量。	無欣無厭，任性無思、任理不作，智自明矣，是名方便、是名無量。	Without joy or aversion, letting the nature be without thought, letting the principle be without action, wisdom will naturally be clear. This is called skillful means, this is called immeasurable.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c01_10']	以淨無量妄想故，不可以情量思度所知故，故名無量方便三昧。	以淨無量妄想故，不可以情量思度所知故，故名無量方便三昧。	Because of purifying immeasurable false thoughts, because it cannot be known by conceptual thinking, therefore it is called the samādhi of immeasurable skillful means.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c02_9']	三者正也，昧之云定，明情識昧、正智自明。	三者正也，昧之云定，明情識昧、正智自明。	Third, zheng means correct, and mei means concentration. When emotional consciousness is obscured, correct wisdom will naturally be clear.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c03_6']	如色無色界三昧，皆以息想慮而得之。	如色無色界三昧，皆以息想慮而得之。	Like the samādhis of the form and formless realms, they are all attained by stopping thoughts and worries.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c04_16']	聲聞緣覺三昧，修厭患觀而對治，樂觀空而滅悲智，以寂滅為樂。	聲聞緣覺三昧，修厭患觀而對治，樂觀空而滅悲智，以寂滅為樂。	The samādhis of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are cultivated by the contemplation of disgust and aversion, delighting in the contemplation of emptiness and extinguishing compassion and wisdom, taking cessation and tranquility as bliss.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c05_16']	權教菩薩樂觀空而行六度，離苦本而生淨國。	權教菩薩樂觀空而行六度，離苦本而生淨國。	The bodhisattvas of the provisional teachings delight in the contemplation of emptiness and practice the six pāramitās, leaving the root of suffering and being born in a pure land.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c07_4']	設有住此界者，言留惑而化眾生，皆非法爾合然，無出沒故。	設有住此界者，言留惑而化眾生，皆非法爾合然，無出沒故。	Even if they remain in this realm, they say they remain in the world to transform sentient beings, but they are not in accord with the inherent nature, because there is no coming or going.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c08_12']	以此義故，此方便三昧者，為一切眾生迷法界體用，五欲情生。	以此義故，此方便三昧者，為一切眾生迷法界體用，五欲情生。	For this reason, this expedient samādhi is for all sentient beings who are deluded about the essence and function of the dharma realm and give rise to the emotions of the five desires.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c10_17']	以不造作心現本智故，便將根本定體淨所妄情，名為方便，非是別於真外別有假安立之定名為方便。	以不造作心現本智故，便將根本定體淨所妄情，名為方便，非是別於真外別有假安立之定名為方便。	Because they do not create the mind and manifest the fundamental wisdom, they take the essence of the fundamental concentration and the pure deluded emotions as expedient means, not a separate concentration established outside of truth that is called expedient means.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c12_10']	譬如以水精寶能清濁水，為珠淨緣現本淨水，非是珠能作得淨水。	譬如以水精寶能清濁水，為珠淨緣現本淨水，非是珠能作得淨水。	It is like a water-purifying crystal that can clarify turbid water, acting as the condition for the purity of the crystal to manifest the originally pure water, not that the crystal can create the pure water.
['ZH_T36_1739_017:0834c14_7']	方便三昧亦復如是，為以萬法無作本自淨緣，現得本自無作智慧力故，故名方便。	方便三昧亦復如是，為以萬法無作本自淨緣，現得本自無作智慧力故，故名方便。	The expedient samādhi is also like this, using the originally pure condition of the myriad dharmas that are uncreated to manifest the originally uncreated power of wisdom, and therefore it is called expedient.

Based on the wisdom-born body, it accords with the true Dharma realm and manifests the form body in front of all sentient beings. However, its essence and characteristics have no coming or going, and it also does not perform the affairs of spiritual transformations.
