Not seeing fools who practice non-dharma, not seeing the disturbance of their body and mind consciousness, the mind not having confused thoughts, flowing and running to different thoughts.

One cuts off the arising of views of annihilation and permanence. One restrains the six sense doors and never looks askance. One vows to be far-reaching and not limited. One cultivates the pure precepts and does not transgress the sequence. If one sees those who have fallen into lower stages, one immediately encourages them to ascend. One reveres and follows the Dharma and does not cut off the fundamental precepts cultivated by the buddhas. Body and mind are joyful and cannot be exhausted. One flourishes the joy of the Way and does not eliminate the Dharma body. One does not cut off the holy assembly and does not have bondage and liberation.

Because of the nature of Dharma, one does not cut off all learning. One makes one's precepts strict and the basis of purity inexhaustible.🔽All who are in birth and death have an end. Transmigrating through the five paths, revolving and returning, one also does not rest. Abiding in impermanent places, this also ends and ceases.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981b27_2']	外道異學雖獲五通不離世智，願求長生後失神足，亦復命盡便涉生死。	外道異學雖獲五通不離世智，願求長生後失神足，亦復命盡便涉生死。	003	Heretics and non-Buddhists, although they attain the five supernatural powers, are not free from worldly wisdom. They vow to seek long life, but later lose their spiritual powers. They also exhaust their lifespans and then enter birth and death.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981b28_19']	或有眾生勤行五戒十善之法得生人天，精勤五戒在欲天中，封受自然功德具足。	或有眾生勤行五戒十善之法得生人天，精勤五戒在欲天中，封受自然功德具足。	003	Some sentient beings diligently practice the five precepts and ten wholesome deeds and are reborn in the human realm or heavens. Those diligent in the five precepts in the desire heavens are born in natural palaces with perfect merits.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c01_4']	或有眾生習學空定在色天中，以歡悅為食不念苦本。	或有眾生習學空定在色天中，以歡悅為食不念苦本。	003	Some sentient beings cultivate the emptiness concentration and are in the form heavens, taking joy and delight as food, not thinking of the original suffering.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c03_2']	或有眾生心識澹然希望無為，謂為無想永寂泥洹，斯皆自調不至究竟滅度之處。	或有眾生心識澹然希望無為，謂為無想永寂泥洹，斯皆自調不至究竟滅度之處。	003	Some sentient beings have a tranquil mind and hope for non-action, thinking it to be the eternal quiescence of nirvana without thought. These all tame themselves but do not reach the ultimate place of nirvana.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c04_9']	第八菩薩觀了斯處而不染著，恒敷演法勸進學者使遠離之。	第八菩薩觀了斯處而不染著，恒敷演法勸進學者使遠離之。	003	The eighth ground bodhisattva observes this place but is not attached to it, always expounding the Dharma and encouraging learners to depart from it.

['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c08_14']	所以然者，以其用心猗泥洹道，緣覺所修菩薩不學，以其發意無大慈哀，有斯學者此皆非正。	所以然者，以其用心猗泥洹道，緣覺所修菩薩不學，以其發意無大慈哀，有斯學者此皆非正。	003	The reason is that their mind relies on the path of nirvana, which is practiced by pratyekabuddhas but not learned by bodhisattvas, because they do not give rise to the intention of great compassion. Those who study in this way are all not correct.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c11_15']	若有菩薩欲究竟學習智慧海，盡其元本而不可窮，誓願不捨一切眾生，修如來法為不滅性，慧無窮極故不可見，道果開敷使得成就。	若有菩薩欲究竟學習智慧海，盡其元本而不可窮，誓願不捨一切眾生，修如來法為不滅性，慧無窮極故不可見，道果開敷使得成就。	003	If there are bodhisattvas who wish to ultimately study the wisdom ocean, to exhaust its fundamental source and yet be inexhaustible, to vow not to abandon all sentient beings, to cultivate the Tathagata's Dharma as the nature of non-extinction, because wisdom is boundless and therefore invisible, the path and fruition blossom and are accomplished.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c13_13']	言種實者，菩薩發意弘誓之心，十力、無畏、十八不共殊特之法，亦不思議亦不可盡。	言種實者，菩薩發意弘誓之心，十力、無畏、十八不共殊特之法，亦不思議亦不可盡。	003	As for the seeds of reality, the bodhisattva gives rise to the intention of vast vows, the ten powers, the fearlessnesses, and the eighteen distinctive qualities of the Buddha, which are also inconceivable and inexhaustible.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c18_11']	第八菩薩在在遊化，執意行忍無能思議，心不念非無有眾惡，不懷恚恨加於眾生，又不興意與人競諍，復不導人有所毀敗，慎護身口不妄有犯，將護眾生慎己行本，不處邪部思惟善業，無愛欲意能莊嚴身如佛色像。	第八菩薩在在遊化，執意行忍無能思議，心不念非無有眾惡，不懷恚恨加於眾生，又不興意與人競諍，復不導人有所毀敗，慎護身口不妄有犯，將護眾生慎己行本，不處邪部思惟善業，無愛欲意能莊嚴身如佛色像。	003	The eighth bodhisattva, wherever he goes to transform, upholds the intention of practicing patience, which is inconceivable. The mind does not think of non-existence, nor does it have various evils. He does not harbor resentment and hatred towards sentient beings, nor does he give rise to the intention of competing and disputing with others. He also does not lead others to destruction. He carefully protects his body and speech, not falsely committing offenses. He carefully protects sentient beings and is cautious in his own practice. He does not dwell in the heretical teachings and contemplates good karma. He has no lustful intentions and is able to adorn his body like the appearance of the Buddha.

He contemplates the signless and does not give rise to chaotic thoughts. He distinguishes the wishless and is forever free from the three existences. The Dharma is originally without sexual desire and is naturally pure. He does not give rise to anger and forever prevents it from being born. He observes and understands ignorance and is not deluded by it.
['ZH_T10_0309_003:0981c25_13']	復當思惟當來過去現在之法，盡無所起諸法自然，不見興滅不見生死不為報應，信作善惡知有果實。	復當思惟當來過去現在之法，盡無所起諸法自然，不見興滅不見生死不為報應，信作善惡知有果實。	003	One should also contemplate the dharmas of the future, past, and present, all of which are ultimately without arising. All dharmas are naturally so, neither seen as arising nor seen as ceasing, neither seen as birth and death nor as retribution. One should believe in the creation of good and evil and know that there are real consequences.

Always contemplate the dharmas of dreams and illusions. If there are deviant thoughts, one should immediately become aware of them. Be gentle and harmonious in disposition, and guard one's mind to prevent the arising of evil. Always give rise to purity.

Taking the impure as pure, they enter the current of desire. Taking suffering as pleasure, taking impermanence as permanence, taking the non-self as the self, they also do not contemplate and remove greed and turbidity, deceiving themselves, not practicing for a long time, not ceasing lust, not giving with wealth, not accepting the Buddha's words. This is called the four corruptions, which further increase the root of craving. The mind thinks and the body acts, mutually accepting and entering each other.

If in the five aggregates one distinguishes arising and ceasing, sentient beings are thereby afflicted by the aggregates. Contemplate one by one the arising of form. Previously, with the appearance of form, I gave rise to consciousness and attachment. Based on consciousness, sensation arises, and together they enter into perception. The arising of intention gives rise to conceptualization, which in turn becomes karmic activity. Thus, from a single form, the five dharmas are eventually formed.

In the dharmas of ordinary beings and the path of sages, the mind is like empty space and also has no partiality.
