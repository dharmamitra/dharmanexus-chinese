His own teacher is forever free from all darkness, establishes the teaching without falsehood, occupies the position of the Great Teacher, and achieves the supreme and unique merits. He arouses sincere faith as a condition, and wishes to correctly spread the teaching established by him. Therefore, he first praises and pays homage to the Blessed Buddha, whose merits of benefiting oneself and benefiting others are perfect, using it as an auspicious sign, and agrees to begin the treatise.
