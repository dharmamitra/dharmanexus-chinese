['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c09_9']	一教起因緣、二藏教所攝、三義理分齊、四教所被機、五教體淺深、六宗趣通局、七部類品會、八傳譯感通、九總釋經題、十別解文義。	一教起因緣、二藏教所攝、三義理分齊、四教所被機、五教體淺深、六宗趣通局、七部類品會、八傳譯感通、九總釋經題、十別解文義。	001	First, the causes and conditions for the arising of the teaching; second, the classification of the canon and teachings; third, the scope of the principles and meanings; fourth, the capacities of beings to be reached by the teaching; fifth, the shallow and deep essence of the teaching; sixth, the general and specific scope of the purport of the teaching; seventh, the categories and assemblies of the scriptures; eighth, the transmission and response of the scriptures; ninth, the general explanation of the title of the sutra; tenth, the specific explanation of the text and meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c12_13']	初因緣者，夫聖人設教必有由致，若須彌巨海大因方為傾搖，今搖如來融金之德山、動深廣之智海，非小緣矣。	初因緣者，夫聖人設教必有由致，若須彌巨海大因方為傾搖，今搖如來融金之德山、動深廣之智海，非小緣矣。	001	As for the first, the causes and conditions, the sages establish teachings only when there is a reason. If it takes a great cause like Mount Sumeru or the great ocean to move them, then the shaking of the Tathagata's mountain of melted gold-like virtues and the stirring of the ocean of profound and vast wisdom is no small matter.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c13_19']	故下經云「非以一緣、非以一事，如來出現而得成就。	故下經云「非以一緣、非以一事，如來出現而得成就。	001	Therefore, the sutra below says, It is not by one condition, not by one thing, that the Tathagata's appearance can be accomplished.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c15_4']	」出現本為大華嚴故，先因後緣各開十義，以顯無盡。	」出現本為大華嚴故，先因後緣各開十義，以顯無盡。	001	 The original purpose of the appearance is for the great Flower Ornament Sutra, so the causes and conditions are each explained in ten meanings to show their inexhaustibility.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c15_9']	因十義者：	因十義者：	001	As for the ten meanings of the causes,
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c18_14']	一法應爾故、二酬宿因故、三順機感故、四為教本故、五顯果德故、六彰地位故、七說勝行故、八示真法故、九開因性故、十利今後故。	一法應爾故、二酬宿因故、三順機感故、四為教本故、五顯果德故、六彰地位故、七說勝行故、八示真法故、九開因性故、十利今後故。	001	First, because it is so by the nature of dharmas; second, because it repays past causes; third, because it accords with the capacities of beings; fourth, because it is the basis of the teachings; fifth, because it manifests the virtues of fruition; sixth, because it reveals the stages of attainment; seventh, because it expounds the supreme practices; eighth, because it shows the true Dharma; ninth, because it opens up the nature of causes; and tenth, because it benefits future generations.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c22_6']	言法爾者，夫王道坦坦千古同規、一乘玄門諸佛齊證，故一切佛，法爾皆於無盡世界常轉如是無盡法輪，令諸眾生反本還源，窮未來際無有休息。	言法爾者，夫王道坦坦千古同規、一乘玄門諸佛齊證，故一切佛，法爾皆於無盡世界常轉如是無盡法輪，令諸眾生反本還源，窮未來際無有休息。	001	As for the nature of dharmas, the Way of the King is vast and open, with the same standard throughout the ages. The profound gate of the One Vehicle is realized by all Buddhas equally. Therefore, all Buddhas, by the nature of dharmas, always turn this inexhaustible Dharma wheel in inexhaustible worlds, enabling all beings to return to the origin and source, continuing on into the future without rest.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c26_3']	故〈不思議品〉中明，一切諸佛能於一身化現不可說不可說佛剎微塵數頭，一一頭化爾所舌，一一舌出爾所音聲，乃至文字句義，一一充滿一切法界無有窮盡。	故〈不思議品〉中明，一切諸佛能於一身化現不可說不可說佛剎微塵數頭，一一頭化爾所舌，一一舌出爾所音聲，乃至文字句義，一一充滿一切法界無有窮盡。	001	Therefore, in the chapter on the inconceivable, it is explained that all Buddhas are able to manifest in one body as many heads as there are dust motes in unspeakably many buddha lands, with each head manifesting that many tongues, and each tongue emitting that many sounds, and so on, with each syllable and meaning filling all Dharma realms without end.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0503c28_15']	斯則處以毛端、橫該法界，時以剎那、豎窮劫海，處則頓起、時則常起，不待別因，但隨見聞說有初成、九會之別。	斯則處以毛端、橫該法界，時以剎那、豎窮劫海，處則頓起、時則常起，不待別因，但隨見聞說有初成、九會之別。	001	This means that in terms of space, it covers the Dharma realm on the tip of a hair, and in terms of time, it extends through the ocean of kalpas in a single moment. In terms of space, it arises suddenly, and in terms of time, it arises constantly, not waiting for separate causes. It is only according to what is seen and heard that there is a distinction between the initial accomplishment and the nine assemblies.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0504a02_17']	諸慈悲者，於無盡中略此流傳，令尋於此見無邊法，如觀牖隙見無際空，而此時處即同無盡，以一處即一切處、一時即一切時故。	諸慈悲者，於無盡中略此流傳，令尋於此見無邊法，如觀牖隙見無際空，而此時處即同無盡，以一處即一切處、一時即一切時故。	001	The compassionate ones, from the inexhaustible, have transmitted this here, enabling one to seek the boundless Dharma here, like observing the end of the sky through a window, while this time and space are the same as the inexhaustible, because one place is all places, and one time is all times.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0504a03_13']	二酬宿因者，何以法爾如是轉耶？	二酬宿因者，何以法爾如是轉耶？	001	Second, repaying past causes means why is it so that it turns like this?
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0504a03_18']	宿因深故。	宿因深故。	001	Because the past causes are profound.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0504a05_2']	夫根深則果茂、源遠則流長，宿因既深，教起亦大。	夫根深則果茂、源遠則流長，宿因既深，教起亦大。	001	If the roots are deep, then the fruit is luxuriant; if the source is far, then the flow is long. Since the past causes are profound, the teachings that arise are also great.
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0504a05_7']	深大云何？	深大云何？	001	How are they profound and great?

Compassion and wisdom operate in tandem, practice and vows are fulfilled together. Therefore, he does not cut off delusions yet thoroughly penetrates the nature of emptiness, the numinous mirror is not polished yet suddenly illuminates myriad dharmas. He expounds this with unobstructed liberation, the past causes of śramaṇas are numerous but in brief there are two kinds:
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0504a09_6']	一者大願力故。	一者大願力故。	001	First, due to the power of great vows.

['ZH_T35_1735_001:0507c14_11']	即由前三藏詮示聲聞理行果，故名聲聞藏；	即由前三藏詮示聲聞理行果，故名聲聞藏；	001	It is precisely because the previous three canons expound the principles, practices, and fruits of the śrāvakas that they are called the śrāvaka canon;
['ZH_T35_1735_001:0507c15_7']	詮示菩薩理行果，故名菩薩藏。	詮示菩薩理行果，故名菩薩藏。	001	because they expound the principles, practices, and fruits of the bodhisattvas, they are called the bodhisattva canon.
