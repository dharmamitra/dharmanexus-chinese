Why is this? The natures and desires of sentient beings are not the same.
['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c03_2']	」性欲不同，種種說法，文辭是一而義別異，義異故眾生解異，解異故得法、得果、得道亦異。	」性欲不同，種種說法，文辭是一而義別異，義異故眾生解異，解異故得法、得果、得道亦異。	10b	 Natures and desires being not the same, the Dharma is expounded in various ways. The words are the same, but the meanings are different. Because the meanings are different, sentient beings' understanding is different. Because the understanding is different, the attainment of the Dharma, attainment of fruition, and attainment of the Way are also different.

['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c08_17']	次說方等十二部經、摩訶般若、華嚴海空，宣說菩薩歷劫修行，而百千比丘、無量眾生發菩提心，或住聲聞，萬億人天得須陀洹，至阿羅漢，住辟支佛。	次說方等十二部經、摩訶般若、華嚴海空，宣說菩薩歷劫修行，而百千比丘、無量眾生發菩提心，或住聲聞，萬億人天得須陀洹，至阿羅漢，住辟支佛。	10b	Next, he expounded the twelve divisions of Vaipulya sutras, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, and the vast and empty Huayan, proclaiming the bodhisattvas' practice through kalpas. Hundreds of thousands of bhikṣus and innumerable beings gave rise to the bodhi mind, some abided in the śrāvaka stage, and myriad koṭīs of humans and devas attained srotāpatti up to arhatship, abiding in pratyekabuddhahood.

['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c13_4']	所以次小說大者，佛本授大，眾生不堪，抽大出小，令斷結成聖，雖有此益，非佛本懷。	所以次小說大者，佛本授大，眾生不堪，抽大出小，令斷結成聖，雖有此益，非佛本懷。	10b	The reason for expounding the Mahāyāna next is that the Buddha originally bestowed the great teaching, but sentient beings were unable to receive it. He extracted the small from the great, enabling them to sever bonds and form sanctity. Although there were these benefits, it was not the Buddha's original intention.
['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c14_17']	次說《方等》、《維摩》、《思益》、《殃掘摩羅》，彈訶小乘保果之僻，譏刺三藏斷滅之非。	次說《方等》、《維摩》、《思益》、《殃掘摩羅》，彈訶小乘保果之僻，譏刺三藏斷滅之非。	10b	Next, he expounded the Vaipulya, Vimalakīrti, Saṃgīti-paryāya, and Aṅgulimālīya, rebuking the biased views of the Hīnayāna that clings to fruition, and criticizing the non-extinction of the Tripiṭaka.
['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c17_4']	故身子、善吉，齊教專小，初不曾聞大乘威德，或茫然棄鉢，或怖畏却華，不知是何言，不知以何答。	故身子、善吉，齊教專小，初不曾聞大乘威德，或茫然棄鉢，或怖畏却華，不知是何言，不知以何答。	10b	Therefore, Śāriputra and Subhūti, who were exclusively devoted to the Small Vehicle teachings, had never heard of the majestic virtue of the Great Vehicle before, and either blankly dropped their bowls or were frightened and turned away from the flowers. They did not know what to say in response.
['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c18_9']	然方等彈斥教在三藏之後，被訶之時應在十二年前。	然方等彈斥教在三藏之後，被訶之時應在十二年前。	10b	However, the teachings of reprimanding and rebuking in the Vaipulya [sutras] come after the Tripiṭaka [sutras], and the time of being reprimanded should be before twelve years [after the Buddha's enlightenment].

Feeling the Buddha's deep kindness, they trusted each other in their hearts and no longer became angry.
['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c22_17']	自昔至今，恣殃掘之譏、任淨名之折，得為恥小慕大之益，喻如烹酪作生蘇，即此義也。	自昔至今，恣殃掘之譏、任淨名之折，得為恥小慕大之益，喻如烹酪作生蘇，即此義也。	10b	From the past up to now, they have allowed Aṅgulimāla's ridicule and accepted Vimalakīrti's rebuke, benefiting from being ashamed of the Small Vehicle and admiring the Great Vehicle. It is like cooking milk to make fresh butter, and this is the meaning of it.

['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c28_14']	《大品》或說無常無我，或說於空，或說不生不滅，皆歷色心至一切種智，句句迴轉，明修行法，即是歷劫修行之意也。	《大品》或說無常無我，或說於空，或說不生不滅，皆歷色心至一切種智，句句迴轉，明修行法，即是歷劫修行之意也。	10b	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra sometimes speaks of impermanence and non-self, sometimes of emptiness, and sometimes of non-arising and non-ceasing. It discusses form and mind up to omniscience, with each phrase turning to clarify the Dharma of cultivation, which is the meaning of practice over kalpas.
['ZH_T33_1716_10b:0807c28_17']	又云：	又云：	10b	It also says:

This verifies that it is the shared prajñā.

For those who did not understand, the great capacity was not yet thick. Using the Tripiṭaka, Vaipulya, and Prajñā [teachings] to refine and mature them, the obstacles were removed and they were able to hear the perfect and sudden [teachings]. He then taught the Lotus Sūtra, revealing the insight into the Buddha's wisdom and enabling them to enter the Dharma realm, which is the same as the Huayan [teachings].

Therefore, after the Prajñā [teachings], the Huayan and Haikong [teachings] are taught, which are the same as the Lotus Sūtra, and are also the fifth period of teachings.

The half-syllable Dharma gates are all the Mahayana. This is merging their Dharma. Yet not hoping to take a single meal's worth of provisions, this means the people are still not merged.
