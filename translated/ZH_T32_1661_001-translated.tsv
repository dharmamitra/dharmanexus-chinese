['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b15_18']	至誠頂禮彼菩提心，如勇健軍執勝器仗，其義亦然。	至誠頂禮彼菩提心，如勇健軍執勝器仗，其義亦然。	I sincerely bow my head to that mind of enlightenment, just as a brave and strong army holds victorious weapons, its meaning is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b18_18']	而彼大菩提心，所有諸佛世尊、諸菩薩摩訶薩，皆因發是菩提心故，我發菩提心亦如是所成，乃至坐菩提場成正覺果，是心堅固。	而彼大菩提心，所有諸佛世尊、諸菩薩摩訶薩，皆因發是菩提心故，我發菩提心亦如是所成，乃至坐菩提場成正覺果，是心堅固。	And that great mind of enlightenment, all the World-Honored Buddhas and Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, all because of giving rise to this mind of enlightenment, I give rise to the mind of enlightenment in the same way, up to sitting in the bodhi-site and accomplishing the fruit of right enlightenment, this mind is firm and solid.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b20_3']	又此菩提心，是諸菩薩總持行門，如是觀想、如是發生。	又此菩提心，是諸菩薩總持行門，如是觀想、如是發生。	Moreover, this mind of enlightenment is the dhāraṇī practice gate of all bodhisattvas, contemplating in this way, giving rise in this way.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b23_2']	我今讚說菩提心者，為令一切眾生息輪迴苦，未得度者普令得度、未解脫者令得解脫、未安隱者令得安隱、未涅盤者令得涅槃。	我今讚說菩提心者，為令一切眾生息輪迴苦，未得度者普令得度、未解脫者令得解脫、未安隱者令得安隱、未涅盤者令得涅槃。	I now praise and explain the mind of enlightenment in order to cause all sentient beings to cease the suffering of cyclic existence, to universally liberate those who have not yet been liberated, to liberate those who have not yet been liberated, to bring peace to those who have not yet been at peace, and to attain nirvana for those who have not yet attained nirvana.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b25_6']	為欲圓滿如是勝願故，安立自相正體因故，入第一義真實觀故，彼菩提心無生自相，是故今說。	為欲圓滿如是勝願故，安立自相正體因故，入第一義真實觀故，彼菩提心無生自相，是故今說。	In order to perfectly fulfill such supreme vows, in order to establish the correct essence of self-characteristics, and in order to enter the contemplation of ultimate truth, the unborn self-characteristics of that mind of enlightenment are therefore explained now.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b25_18']	所言菩提心者，離一切性。	所言菩提心者，離一切性。	As for the so-called mind of enlightenment, it is free from all natures.

['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b26_8']	此中云何離一切性？	此中云何離一切性？	How is it free from all natures in this context?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b26_10']	答：	答：	The answer is:
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b27_17']	謂蘊處界離諸取捨，法無我平等，自心本來不生，自性空故。	謂蘊處界離諸取捨，法無我平等，自心本來不生，自性空故。	It refers to the aggregates, sense bases, and elements being free from all grasping and abandoning, the equality of the selflessness of phenomena, the originally unborn mind itself, because of the emptiness of inherent nature.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541b28_4']	此中云何謂我？	此中云何謂我？	What is meant by self in this context?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c01_3']	蘊等有所表了，而分別心現前無體，是故若常覺了菩提心者，即能安住諸法空相。	蘊等有所表了，而分別心現前無體，是故若常覺了菩提心者，即能安住諸法空相。	The aggregates and so forth have something that can be indicated, but the discriminating mind is not present. Therefore, if one is always aware of the enlightened mind, one can abide in the empty characteristics of all dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c03_1']	又復常所覺了彼菩提心，以悲心觀大悲為體，由如是故，於諸蘊中無我相可得。	又復常所覺了彼菩提心，以悲心觀大悲為體，由如是故，於諸蘊中無我相可得。	Moreover, that enlightened mind which is always aware, observes with a compassionate mind, and takes great compassion as its essence. For this reason, in the aggregates, the characteristic of self cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c04_7']	有諸外道起非相應行、執相分別，謂諸蘊有，非無常法。	有諸外道起非相應行、執相分別，謂諸蘊有，非無常法。	There are non-Buddhists who give rise to non-corresponding practices and grasp characteristics discriminatively, saying that the aggregates exist and are not impermanent dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c06_13']	而實非彼我相可得，諸法任持真實性中不可執常亦非無常，於我蘊中名尚無實，況復有作及諸分別。	而實非彼我相可得，諸法任持真實性中不可執常亦非無常，於我蘊中名尚無實，況復有作及諸分別。	But in reality, the characteristic of self cannot be obtained. In the true nature of the upholding of dharmas, one cannot grasp permanence or impermanence. Even the name in the aggregates of self is not real, let alone the existence of actions and various discriminations.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c07_19']	若言有一法乃至有諸法，作此說者，世間心轉隨世間行。	若言有一法乃至有諸法，作此說者，世間心轉隨世間行。	If one says there is one dharma up to there being various dharmas, one who makes this statement turns the worldly mind and follows worldly practices.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c08_9']	彼非相應，為常行相。	彼非相應，為常行相。	That is not corresponding, for the characteristic of constant practice.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c09_12']	此義不然，是故當知諸法無性，若內若外不可分別。	此義不然，是故當知諸法無性，若內若外不可分別。	This meaning is not so. Therefore, one should know that all dharmas are without nature, whether internal or external, and cannot be discriminated.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c10_11']	彼能執心而有何因，謂不能離隨世間相？	彼能執心而有何因，謂不能離隨世間相？	What is the cause of that grasping mind? Namely, it is unable to be apart from the characteristics of the worldly realm.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c11_10']	若因若相是二無別，此即非常亦非能執。	若因若相是二無別，此即非常亦非能執。	If cause and characteristics are not different, this is neither permanent nor able to grasp.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c12_8']	當知心性不可執常，是故彼性無常是常。	當知心性不可執常，是故彼性無常是常。	One should know that the nature of the mind cannot be grasped as permanent. Therefore, that nature is impermanent and permanent.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c13_12']	若知彼性是無常者，當何所作、從何所生取我等相？	若知彼性是無常者，當何所作、從何所生取我等相？	If one knows that nature to be impermanent, what should be done and from what should be born to grasp the characteristics of self and so forth?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c15_5']	若離世間，即於蘊中無有障礙，若處若界覺了亦然，取捨二法即不可得。	若離世間，即於蘊中無有障礙，若處若界覺了亦然，取捨二法即不可得。	If apart from the worldly realm, then within the aggregates there is no obstruction. If in the sense bases or elements, understanding is also thus. The two dharmas of grasping and abandoning are then unobtainable.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c17_7']	此中言蘊者，謂色受想行識，此說為五蘊，諸聲聞人於是中學。	此中言蘊者，謂色受想行識，此說為五蘊，諸聲聞人於是中學。	Here, what is called the aggregates are form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. This is said to be the five aggregates. The śrāvakas train in this.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c18_17']	復次當知，色如聚沫、受如浮泡、想如陽焰、行如芭蕉、識如幻士。	復次當知，色如聚沫、受如浮泡、想如陽焰、行如芭蕉、識如幻士。	Furthermore, one should know that form is like a mass of foam, feeling is like a floating bubble, perception is like a mirage, mental formations are like a plantain tree, and consciousness is like an illusory person.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c19_14']	此五蘊義，佛二足尊為諸菩薩如應宣說。	此五蘊義，佛二足尊為諸菩薩如應宣說。	The meaning of these five aggregates was proclaimed by the Buddha, the Honored One of the Two-footed, for the Bodhisattvas as appropriate.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c21_6']	所言色蘊者，今略示其相，謂四大種及彼所造，說為色蘊。	所言色蘊者，今略示其相，謂四大種及彼所造，說為色蘊。	As for the aggregate of form, I will now briefly indicate its characteristics. It is said to be the four great elements and their derivatives, which are called the aggregate of form.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c21_20']	彼非色者，謂即所餘受想行三。	彼非色者，謂即所餘受想行三。	That which is not form refers to the remaining three: feeling, perception, and mental formations.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c22_13']	諸教應知識蘊，行想如下當說。	諸教應知識蘊，行想如下當說。	One should know that the aggregate of consciousness is as will be explained below.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c24_3']	此中言處者，謂內眼等處、外色等處，此說為十二處。	此中言處者，謂內眼等處、外色等處，此說為十二處。	Here, the term sense bases refers to the internal sense bases such as the eye, and the external sense bases such as form. These are said to be the twelve sense bases.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c26_9']	此中言界者，謂眼根等界、眼識等界、色等境界，此說為十八界。	此中言界者，謂眼根等界、眼識等界、色等境界，此說為十八界。	Here, the term elements refers to the elements such as the eye faculty, the elements such as eye consciousness, and the elements such as form objects. These are said to be the eighteen elements.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c28_7']	如是蘊處界離諸取捨，無方無分不可分別，分別見者是義不然，隨起分別即有所著。	如是蘊處界離諸取捨，無方無分不可分別，分別見者是義不然，隨起分別即有所著。	Thus, the aggregates, sense bases, and elements are free from grasping and abandoning, have no direction, no parts, and cannot be discriminated. It is not reasonable to view them through discrimination, for if one gives rise to discrimination, there will be attachment.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c28_16']	彼復云何而得相應？	彼復云何而得相應？	How can one attain harmony with them?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0541c29_15']	若有一相見外義者，當知此為破智所轉。	若有一相見外義者，當知此為破智所轉。	If one sees external objects as having a single characteristic, one should know that this is the turning of the mind that destroys wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a01_5']	意長養色是義云何？	意長養色是義云何？	How is it that the mind nourishes form?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a01_14']	應知如是非一非異。	應知如是非一非異。	One should know that it is neither the same nor different.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a02_16']	有諸外道波哩沒囉惹迦等，隨諸異見起三分別。	有諸外道波哩沒囉惹迦等，隨諸異見起三分別。	There are non-Buddhists such as the Parivrājakas who, following various wrong views, give rise to three kinds of discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a04_1']	是義不然，如人夢中造殺害事，而彼所作無實行相。	是義不然，如人夢中造殺害事，而彼所作無實行相。	This is not so. It is like a person who, in a dream, commits murder, but the act has no real form.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a04_19']	又如人夢居最上處，而彼亦非殊勝行相。	又如人夢居最上處，而彼亦非殊勝行相。	It is also like a person who, in a dream, occupies the highest position, but that is also not a superior form.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a05_4']	此義云何？	此義云何？	What does this mean?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a05_14']	謂識光明破取捨相故。	謂識光明破取捨相故。	It means that the light of consciousness breaks through the forms of grasping and abandoning.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a06_4']	識法如是，外義何有？	識法如是，外義何有？	Consciousness is like this, so how can there be external objects?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a06_13']	是故諸法無有外義。	是故諸法無有外義。	Therefore, all dharmas have no external objects.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a08_11']	當知一切色相所表，自識光明色相照耀，如人見彼幻化、陽焰、乾闥婆城取以為實。	當知一切色相所表，自識光明色相照耀，如人見彼幻化、陽焰、乾闥婆城取以為實。	One should know that all forms and appearances are the light of one's own consciousness, shining with the colors and forms of light. It is like a person who sees illusions, mirages, and gandharva cities and takes them to be real.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a09_19']	諸無智人以愚執心，觀色等實亦復如是，由此我執是心隨轉。	諸無智人以愚執心，觀色等實亦復如是，由此我執是心隨轉。	Ignorant people, with minds of foolishness, observe the reality of form and so forth in the same way. Because of this, the self-grasping mind revolves.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a11_16']	如先所說蘊處界義，應知離彼諸分差別，唯心分位所施設故，而種種相唯心所現。	如先所說蘊處界義，應知離彼諸分差別，唯心分位所施設故，而種種相唯心所現。	As explained above, the meanings of the aggregates, sense bases, and elements should be understood as being apart from their various distinctions, because they are only established as mental states, and their various characteristics are only manifested by the mind.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a12_15']	此義成就，如《成唯識》說，此中問言：	此義成就，如《成唯識》說，此中問言：	This meaning is accomplished, as the Cheng Weishi Lun says, asking this question:
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a13_3']	前說五蘊，識云何自相？	前說五蘊，識云何自相？	Previously, the five aggregates were explained. How is consciousness its own characteristic?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a13_5']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a13_15']	如說心義，識亦如是。	如說心義，識亦如是。	As explained in the meaning of mind, consciousness is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a14_3']	如佛世尊常作是說：	如佛世尊常作是說：	As the World-Honored Buddha always says:
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a14_12']	應知一切唯心所現。	應知一切唯心所現。	One should know that everything is only manifested by the mind.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a15_11']	此義甚深，諸愚癡者不能了故，不見真實。	此義甚深，諸愚癡者不能了故，不見真實。	This meaning is very profound. Because the ignorant cannot understand it, they do not see the truth.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a16_10']	是故若能空其我相，即於是心不生分別。	是故若能空其我相，即於是心不生分別。	Therefore, if one can empty the characteristics of self, then in this mind, one does not give rise to discrimination.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a17_8']	起分別者謂邪教故，彼所建立是義不成。	起分別者謂邪教故，彼所建立是義不成。	Those who give rise to discrimination are due to wrong teachings. What they establish is not a valid meaning.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a20_6']	如實義者見法無我，是大乘中法無我義，自心本來而不生故，隨有所生亦復平等，自心增上入真實義，瑜伽行門所出生故。	如實義者見法無我，是大乘中法無我義，自心本來而不生故，隨有所生亦復平等，自心增上入真實義，瑜伽行門所出生故。	The true meaning is that seeing the non-self of phenomena is the meaning of the non-self of phenomena in the Great Vehicle, because one's own mind is originally unborn, and whatever arises is also equal. The superior mind enters the true meaning, because it arises from the yoga practice.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a21_11']	此中應知，彼後所依而無實體，此即名為淨心現行。	此中應知，彼後所依而無實體，此即名為淨心現行。	Herein, one should know that the later basis is without real substance, and this is called the pure mind's activity.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a22_1']	若過去法，過去無實；	若過去法，過去無實；	If past dharmas, past is unreal;
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a22_11']	若未來法，未來未至；	若未來法，未來未至；	If future dharmas, future is not yet arrived;
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a22_21']	若現在法，現在不住；	若現在法，現在不住；	If present dharmas, present does not abide;
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a23_8']	於三世中當云何住？	於三世中當云何住？	How should one abide in the three times?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a24_16']	如軍林等多法成故，應知識者是無我相，彼識亦非為所依故。	如軍林等多法成故，應知識者是無我相，彼識亦非為所依故。	Because many dharmas are formed, like an army or a forest, one should know that the knower is the characteristic of non-self, and that consciousness is also not the basis.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a25_15']	若於諸法如是見已，猶如赤雲速疾散滅。	若於諸法如是見已，猶如赤雲速疾散滅。	If one sees the dharmas like this, they will quickly disperse like red clouds.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a26_19']	是故當知，若法有者從思所現，阿賴耶識亦復如是。	是故當知，若法有者從思所現，阿賴耶識亦復如是。	Therefore, one should know that if dharmas exist, they appear from thought. The ālaya consciousness is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a28_12']	諸有情類若來若去，法爾如是，譬如大海眾流所歸，阿賴耶識所依亦然。	諸有情類若來若去，法爾如是，譬如大海眾流所歸，阿賴耶識所依亦然。	All sentient beings, whether coming or going, are by nature like this, just as the great ocean is the destination of all rivers. The basis of the ālaya-vijñāna is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542a29_12']	若有如是觀彼識者，即不可有分別心生。	若有如是觀彼識者，即不可有分別心生。	If there is such an observation of that consciousness, then there cannot be a discriminating mind arising.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b01_11']	若彼各各如實知者，而彼彼名復云何說？	若彼各各如實知者，而彼彼名復云何說？	If each of them knows it as it really is, then how can those names be spoken?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b02_11']	若彼各各知諸物性，即彼各各不能稱說。	若彼各各知諸物性，即彼各各不能稱說。	If each of them knows the nature of things, then each of them cannot express it.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b03_19']	作此說者是決定語，是故諸法亦決定生，於一切事隨轉成就。	作此說者是決定語，是故諸法亦決定生，於一切事隨轉成就。	One who speaks like this uses definitive language. Therefore, all dharmas also definitely arise, and in all matters they function and are accomplished.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b04_19']	能知、所知是二差別，所知若無，能知何立？	能知、所知是二差別，所知若無，能知何立？	The difference between the knower and the known, if the known does not exist, how can the knower be established?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b05_8']	二俱無實，法云何得？	二俱無實，法云何得？	Both are unreal, how can dharmas be obtained?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b07_7']	是故應知，所言心者而但有名，彼名亦復無別可得，但以表了故，彼名自性亦不可得。	是故應知，所言心者而但有名，彼名亦復無別可得，但以表了故，彼名自性亦不可得。	Therefore, one should know that what is called mind is merely a name, and that name is also not something separate that can be obtained. It is only used to indicate, therefore that name's self-nature is also unobtainable.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b11_10']	以是義故，智者應當觀菩提心自性如幻，若內若外及二中間求不可得，無法可取、無法可捨，非形色可見、非顯色可表，非男女相非黃門相，不於一切色相中住，無法可見非眼境界。	以是義故，智者應當觀菩提心自性如幻，若內若外及二中間求不可得，無法可取、無法可捨，非形色可見、非顯色可表，非男女相非黃門相，不於一切色相中住，無法可見非眼境界。	For this reason, the wise should contemplate that the nature of the bodhicitta is like an illusion. Whether internally, externally, or in between the two, it cannot be found. There is nothing to grasp and nothing to abandon. It cannot be seen as a form or shape, nor can it be indicated as a color. It is neither the characteristics of a male nor a eunuch. It does not abide in any form or appearance. There is nothing to be seen, and it is not within the realm of the eyes.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b12_18']	唯一切佛觀察平等，若心自性、若無自性，平等法中云何得見？	唯一切佛觀察平等，若心自性、若無自性，平等法中云何得見？	Only all Buddhas observe equality. Whether it is the nature of the mind or the absence of nature, in the Dharma of equality, how can it be seen?
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b13_16']	所言性者名分別故，若離分別心性俱空。	所言性者名分別故，若離分別心性俱空。	What is called nature is called discrimination. If one is apart from discrimination, the nature of the mind is both empty.
['ZH_T32_1661_001:0542b14_15']	若有分別可見心者，此中云何說名為空？	若有分別可見心者，此中云何說名為空？	If there is a mind that can be seen through discrimination, how can it be called empty in this case?
