['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527b25_2']	二「愛非愛緣起」，即諸業習氣。	二「愛非愛緣起」，即諸業習氣。	066	Second, the dependent arising of what is loved and not loved refers to the habitual tendencies of various karmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527b26_13']	全同《唯識》「由諸業習氣、二取習氣俱，前異熟既盡，復生餘異熟」也。	全同《唯識》「由諸業習氣、二取習氣俱，前異熟既盡，復生餘異熟」也。	066	It is completely the same as the statement in the Vijñaptimātratā-śāstra: Due to the perfuming of various karmas and the perfuming of the two graspings, when the previous retribution is exhausted, it produces other retribution.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527b27_9']	疏「二含俱舍」下，即第二約義攝五。	疏「二含俱舍」下，即第二約義攝五。	066	The commentary below The second includes the Abhidharma-kośa is the second, which is about the five being included in the meaning.

['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527b28_8']	標列唯四，何言攝五？	標列唯四，何言攝五？	066	The headings only list four, so why is it said to include five?

['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c01_11']	三「此中正當第一」下，別釋剎那，即消經文。	三「此中正當第一」下，別釋剎那，即消經文。	066	Third, below This is the first, it specifically explains the moment, which is to explain the sutra text.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c01_16']	於中有三：	於中有三：	066	Within this, there are three parts:
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c02_11']	初別釋、二總結、三例釋同體。	初別釋、二總結、三例釋同體。	066	First, specific explanation; second, concluding summary; third, giving an example to explain having the same substance.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c02_14']	今初。	今初。	066	Now, the first.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c04_1']	疏「故今不必依次」者，初即識支、二是行支、三方無明，故不依次。	疏「故今不必依次」者，初即識支、二是行支、三方無明，故不依次。	066	The commentary states Therefore, it is not necessary to rely on the sequence now. The first is the consciousness link, the second is the karmic link, and the third is only ignorance, so it does not rely on the sequence.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c05_17']	而《俱舍》具有十二，下云「癡是無明，思即是行」，猶依次第，況不依次非一剎那？	而《俱舍》具有十二，下云「癡是無明，思即是行」，猶依次第，況不依次非一剎那？	066	However, the Abhidharma-kośa has twelve, and below it says delusion is ignorance, and thought is simply karmic activity, still following the sequence. Moreover, not following the sequence is not a single moment.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c06_15']	疏「謂行此貪事必依心起」下，識支。	疏「謂行此貪事必依心起」下，識支。	066	The commentary says when engaging in this greedy activity, it must arise based on the mind, which is the consciousness link.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c06_20']	然有二義：	然有二義：	066	However, there are two meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c07_12']	一依心起是大乘義，即八識心。	一依心起是大乘義，即八識心。	066	First, arising based on the mind is the meaning of the Mahāyāna, which is the eight consciousnesses.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c08_12']	「復了別」下，即《俱舍》意，於諸境界了別名識。	「復了別」下，即《俱舍》意，於諸境界了別名識。	066	Again, discrimination... is the meaning of the Abhidharma-kośa, which means that consciousness is named because it discriminates various objects.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c10_3']	疏「不生五識唯名十界」等者，十界即五根、五境，以十八界根識別故。	疏「不生五識唯名十界」等者，十界即五根、五境，以十八界根識別故。	066	The commentary says the five consciousnesses that do not arise are only named the ten realms, and so on. The ten realms are the five faculties and five objects, because the eighteen realms are distinguished by faculties and consciousnesses.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c11_15']	若明十二處，攝識在根，故云五識依生乃名十處，五根加意故云六處。	若明十二處，攝識在根，故云五識依生乃名十處，五根加意故云六處。	066	If clarifying the twelve sense bases, consciousness is included in the faculties, so it says the five consciousnesses are named the ten sense bases when they arise based on the faculties, because the five faculties plus the mind are called the six sense bases.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c12_5']	大乘意，根異識支故；	大乘意，根異識支故；	066	The meaning of the Mahāyāna is that the faculties are different from the consciousness link.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c13_10']	《俱舍》小乘即第六識是識支體，故云住名色根說為六處。	《俱舍》小乘即第六識是識支體，故云住名色根說為六處。	066	The Abhidharma-kośa of the Hīnayāna takes the sixth consciousness itself as the substance of the consciousness link, hence it says dwelling in name-and-form, the faculties are called the six sense bases.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c14_16']	彼疏釋云「眼等五識住名色根，故說五根以名六處。	彼疏釋云「眼等五識住名色根，故說五根以名六處。	066	Their commentary explains: The five consciousnesses such as the eye consciousness dwell in the faculties of name-and-form, therefore the five faculties are called the six sense bases.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c15_9']	雖即勝是五，六處攝故。	雖即勝是五，六處攝故。	066	Although they are superior, they are included in the six sense bases.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c16_1']	」疏「貪必對境」者，釋觸也。	」疏「貪必對境」者，釋觸也。	066	The commentary says craving must confront an object explains contact.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c16_13']	論云「六處對餘和合是觸。	論云「六處對餘和合是觸。	066	The treatise says: The six sense bases confronting the other and combining is contact.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c16_17']	」釋云：	」釋云：	066	The commentary explains:
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c17_1']	餘謂識境。	餘謂識境。	066	The other refers to consciousness and objects.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c17_11']	釋取順經，云是欲取。	釋取順經，云是欲取。	066	The commentary explains grasping in accordance with the sūtra, saying it is the grasping of desire.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c19_10']	若《俱舍》云「與此相應諸纏名取」，彼疏釋云「即無慚無愧、惛沈掉舉等」，與貪相應也。	若《俱舍》云「與此相應諸纏名取」，彼疏釋云「即無慚無愧、惛沈掉舉等」，與貪相應也。	066	If the Abhidharma-kośa says the various bonds associated with this are called grasping, their commentary explains: It is the lack of conscience, lack of shame, torpor, restlessness, etc., which are associated with craving.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c19_20']	釋有，順經云諸支生。	釋有，順經云諸支生。	066	The commentary explains existence in accordance with the sūtra, saying it is the arising of the various links.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c21_4']	若《俱舍》云「所起身語二業名有，老壞為死」，全同論文。	若《俱舍》云「所起身語二業名有，老壞為死」，全同論文。	066	If the Abhidharma-kośa says the two kinds of karma of body and speech that are produced are called existence, and old age and destruction are death, it is completely the same as the treatise text.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c21_16']	「剎那滅故」，是彼疏釋。	「剎那滅故」，是彼疏釋。	066	Because they perish in a moment, is the explanation in that commentary.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c22_15']	疏「此若不斷則名連縛」下，第二略釋餘三緣起。	疏「此若不斷則名連縛」下，第二略釋餘三緣起。	066	The commentary, below If this is not severed, it is called continuous connection, is the second brief explanation of the remaining three dependent originations.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c25_2']	論云連縛者，如《品類足論》「謂遍有為十二支位，所有五蘊皆分位攝，即此懸遠相續無始，說為遠續。	論云連縛者，如《品類足論》「謂遍有為十二支位，所有五蘊皆分位攝，即此懸遠相續無始，說為遠續。	066	The treatise says: As for continuous connection, it is as the Prakaraṇa-śāstra says: 'It refers to the five aggregates in the twelve stages of conditioned phenomena, all of which are included in the states. This distant and continuous [connection] has no beginning, and is called distant continuation.'
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c25_8']	」上皆論文。	」上皆論文。	066	The above is all from the treatise.

['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c26_2']	連縛要因果無間相連起也。	連縛要因果無間相連起也。	066	Continuous connection must be based on cause and effect, with no interval between them.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c27_7']	若情非情皆有生滅念念相續，故剎那連縛遍一切有為。	若情非情皆有生滅念念相續，故剎那連縛遍一切有為。	066	Whether sentient or insentient, all have birth and cessation, with moments of thought continuing in succession, thus the momentary continuous connection pervades all conditioned phenomena.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0527c27_15']	云謂遍有為分位。	云謂遍有為分位。	066	It says: 'It refers to the states of conditioned phenomena.'
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0528a01_4']	緣起要約順生受業及不定業，三世十二支五蘊分位若遠續者，即前分位遠相續耳，故論云即此相續。	緣起要約順生受業及不定業，三世十二支五蘊分位若遠續者，即前分位遠相續耳，故論云即此相續。	066	Dependent origination is based on karma that produces results in the next life and indeterminate karma. The states of the five aggregates in the three times and twelve links, if they are distant and continuous, are simply the distant continuation of those states, thus the treatise says 'this very continuation.'
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0528a03_8']	《順正理論》云「遠續緣起，謂前後際有順後受業及不定業，無始流轉，如說無明有愛本際不可知等。	《順正理論》云「遠續緣起，謂前後際有順後受業及不定業，無始流轉，如說無明有愛本際不可知等。	066	The Nyāyānusāra śāstra says: The distant continuity of dependent arising refers to the karma that produces results in the future and indeterminate karma in the past and future. It has been flowing without beginning, as it is said that the beginning of ignorance and craving cannot be known, etc.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0528a04_3']	連縛緣起，取相隣接相繫不斷。	連縛緣起，取相隣接相繫不斷。	066	The continuous bondage of dependent arising refers to the uninterrupted connection of successive moments.
['ZH_T36_1736_066:0528a04_20']	」彼疏云「遠續唯隔越，連縛唯無間。	」彼疏云「遠續唯隔越，連縛唯無間。	066	 The commentary says: Distant continuity only refers to what is separated, while continuous bondage only refers to what is immediate.
