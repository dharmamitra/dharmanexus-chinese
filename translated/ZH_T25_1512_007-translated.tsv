['ZH_T25_1512_007:0844a14_7']	此經所以來者，前第八段中明一切眾生雖皆有真如佛性平等無差，要修行者見、不修行者則不能見。	此經所以來者，前第八段中明一切眾生雖皆有真如佛性平等無差，要修行者見、不修行者則不能見。	The reason this sūtra comes is that in the previous eighth section, it is explained that although all sentient beings have the true suchness Buddha-nature equally without distinction, only those who practice can see it, while those who do not practice cannot see it.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0844a16_13']	上已明依此經受持讀誦三種修行能見佛性，然猶非究竟勝行，未知為直依此經三種修行得見佛性？	上已明依此經受持讀誦三種修行能見佛性，然猶非究竟勝行，未知為直依此經三種修行得見佛性？	Above, it has already been explained that relying on this sūtra to uphold, recite, and chant the three kinds of practices can see the Buddha-nature, but this is still not the ultimate superior practice. It is not yet known whether one can directly see the Buddha-nature by relying on the three kinds of practices in this sūtra,

['ZH_T25_1512_007:0844a28_16']	所以此段獨得利益之稱者，然上來雖明依此經修行有多利益，未若此段明由持經因緣發生思修二慧，能轉過去重業現世輕受，未來復得世間出世間二種果報。	所以此段獨得利益之稱者，然上來雖明依此經修行有多利益，未若此段明由持經因緣發生思修二慧，能轉過去重業現世輕受，未來復得世間出世間二種果報。	The reason this section alone is called benefits is that although the previous sections have already clarified that there are many benefits to practicing based on this sūtra, it is not the same as this section which clarifies that due to the causes and conditions of upholding the sūtra, one gives rise to the two kinds of wisdom of contemplation and cultivation, which can transform heavy karma from the past into light suffering in the present life, and in the future one will again obtain the two kinds of karmic rewards of the mundane and supramundane.

Taking this one section as nine kinds of chapters, or ten kinds, is the meaning of benefits. Therefore, the sūtra begins by saying to put it briefly, which is to list the nine kinds of chapters in brief and clarify the benefits.

Why is it not given the name resolving doubts, while this section alone gets the title resolving doubts?

The text is roughly the same, but the doubts are different, and the meaning of the answer is also different. Therefore, it alone obtains the name of cutting off doubts.

['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c03_16']	云何上第三段中，明菩薩證得初地無生二種無我見道之解，具足四種深心、永斷三界四住習氣無明麁品、離五怖畏，住於初地平等理中，不見彼是眾生、我為菩薩。	云何上第三段中，明菩薩證得初地無生二種無我見道之解，具足四種深心、永斷三界四住習氣無明麁品、離五怖畏，住於初地平等理中，不見彼是眾生、我為菩薩。	How is it that in the third section above, it clarifies that the bodhisattva realizes the first ground, the path of seeing of the two kinds of non-self, is fully endowed with the four kinds of profound mind, permanently eliminates the coarse aspects of the afflictions and ignorance of the three realms, is free from the five fears, and abides in the principle of equality of the first ground, not seeing sentient beings as others and oneself as the bodhisattva?
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c04_6']	於此理中柔伏其心；	於此理中柔伏其心；	Within this principle, one subdues one's mind;

Because one attains this understanding, one thinks: I am able to be fully endowed with the four kinds of profound mind and abide in the first ground, I am able to not be attached to the three matters and practice, I am able to not see the three matters and subdue my mind, I am able to eliminate afflictions, I am able to transform people. There is this discriminating mind.

['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c10_13']	若菩薩以證見道修無我之解，何故猶云我能證平等理，不見眾生異於菩薩，乃至我能修行等？	若菩薩以證見道修無我之解，何故猶云我能證平等理，不見眾生異於菩薩，乃至我能修行等？	If bodhisattvas realize the path of seeing and cultivate the understanding of non-self, why do they still say I can realize the principle of equality and I do not see sentient beings as different from bodhisattvas, up to I can cultivate and so forth?
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c11_11']	既自得無我解，今言不見，誰云不見？	既自得無我解，今言不見，誰云不見？	Since they themselves have attained the understanding of non-self, who says I do not see now?

['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c14_4']	即眾生五陰是菩薩，更無別菩薩。	即眾生五陰是菩薩，更無別菩薩。	The five aggregates of sentient beings are the bodhisattvas, there is no separate bodhisattva.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c15_4']	若眾生五陰非菩薩者，何故菩薩自言我能？	若眾生五陰非菩薩者，何故菩薩自言我能？	If the five aggregates of sentient beings are not the bodhisattvas, why do the bodhisattvas say I can?
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c16_4']	以此驗之，故知即此眾生五陰是實菩薩也。	以此驗之，故知即此眾生五陰是實菩薩也。	Judging from this, we know that the five aggregates of sentient beings are the real bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c17_8']	為除此疑故，言實無有法名為菩薩發三菩提心者也。	為除此疑故，言實無有法名為菩薩發三菩提心者也。	In order to eliminate this doubt, it is said that there is really no dharma called a bodhisattva who gives rise to the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c19_8']	今明實無有法名為菩薩者，假名名字眾生，體虛妄不實，五陰因緣滅法，體本來空寂。	今明實無有法名為菩薩者，假名名字眾生，體虛妄不實，五陰因緣滅法，體本來空寂。	Now, it is explained that there is truly no dharma that can be called a bodhisattva. The sentient beings of provisional names and words are essentially false and unreal, and the dharmas of the cessation of the causes and conditions of the five aggregates are originally empty and tranquil.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c20_10']	於眾生五陰有為法中，無有一法是實可名為菩薩。	於眾生五陰有為法中，無有一法是實可名為菩薩。	Within the conditioned dharmas of the five aggregates of sentient beings, there is not a single real dharma that can be called a bodhisattva.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c22_1']	若眾生五陰中無有一法是實名為菩薩者，云何而言我是菩薩？	若眾生五陰中無有一法是實名為菩薩者，云何而言我是菩薩？	If within the five aggregates of sentient beings there is not a single real dharma that can be called a bodhisattva, then how can it be said that I am a bodhisattva?
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c24_12']	然今言我是菩薩、我能見修、我能修行等者，非謂菩薩發初地已猶存眾生五陰以之為我，有身見等麁惑未盡也。	然今言我是菩薩、我能見修、我能修行等者，非謂菩薩發初地已猶存眾生五陰以之為我，有身見等麁惑未盡也。	However, now to say that I am a bodhisattva, that I can see and cultivate, that I can practice and so forth, does not mean that the bodhisattva, having attained the first ground, still takes the five aggregates of sentient beings as the self, and has not yet exhausted the coarse afflictions such as the view of the real existence of the body and so forth.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0846c29_11']	所以尚言我能者，明見道修道二種菩薩，雖現見真性斷除四住不善煩惱等一品麁惑，猶有無明住地根本煩惱細惑，於善法中有微分別心未斷盡故，有此功用之惑，於七地以還非患，乃障八地以上無功用不住道解。	所以尚言我能者，明見道修道二種菩薩，雖現見真性斷除四住不善煩惱等一品麁惑，猶有無明住地根本煩惱細惑，於善法中有微分別心未斷盡故，有此功用之惑，於七地以還非患，乃障八地以上無功用不住道解。	The reason for still speaking of I can is to clarify that the two kinds of bodhisattvas of the path of insight and the path of cultivation, although they presently see the true nature and eliminate the coarse afflictions such as the four abodes of ignorance, still have the subtle afflictions of the fundamental afflictions of the ground of ignorance, because there is a slight discriminating mind towards wholesome dharmas that has not been completely eliminated, and there are afflictions of this effort. On the seventh ground and below, this is not a problem, but it obstructs the path of non-abiding without effort above the eighth ground.
['ZH_T25_1512_007:0847a02_9']	因斷此疑，即勵諸菩薩，遣存我分別之心故，言實無有法名為菩薩發三菩提心也。	因斷此疑，即勵諸菩薩，遣存我分別之心故，言實無有法名為菩薩發三菩提心也。	Because of eliminating this doubt, it encourages the bodhisattvas to abandon the mind of discriminating I and says that there is really no dharma called a bodhisattva who gives rise to the mind of supreme, perfect enlightenment.

['ZH_T25_1512_007:0847a12_8']	此之分別等，即是根本無明，於善法中分別之惑也。	此之分別等，即是根本無明，於善法中分別之惑也。	This kind of discrimination and so forth is precisely the fundamental ignorance, the deluded thoughts of discrimination within good dharmas.

It clarifies that such distinctions as I can cultivate... are the afflictions of the functioning of ignorance of wholesome dharmas, obstructing the mind above the eighth ground.

['ZH_T25_1512_007:0847a20_13']	此言「不住」者，不住功用心、不住無功用心，故名不住道也。	此言「不住」者，不住功用心、不住無功用心，故名不住道也。	The word non-abiding here means not abiding in the mind of effortful practice and not abiding in the mind of effortless practice, thus it is called the path of non-abiding.

Since there are Buddhas who realize the fruit, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas are not solely self-benefited, and they also transform others to attain the same. Therefore, they give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment, practice, deliver sentient beings, cause them to enter nirvāṇa, and cultivate the practice of the Pure Land. However, they know that apart from the true suchness and dharma realm, there are no real bodhisattvas who are able to deliver, no real sentient beings who can be delivered, and no true Pure Land to be cultivated.

The meaning is the same as the illusory myriad phenomena not being true bodhi, and true suchness and non-arising being the characteristics of true bodhi, therefore it says bodhisattvas are also like this.

It is not that there is a separate Pure Land to be adorned obtained through the pāramitā practices of a different dharma. Therefore, it is repeated as adorn.
