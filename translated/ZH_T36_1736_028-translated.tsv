Now, relying on the Buddhagotra-śāstra, I will briefly show its characteristics:
['ZH_T36_1736_028:0210c21_3']	一方便生死，謂生死緣即無明住地惑，能生新無漏業，譬如界內無明生行，以惑生智非同類故，名為方便。	一方便生死，謂生死緣即無明住地惑，能生新無漏業，譬如界內無明生行，以惑生智非同類故，名為方便。	028	First, expedient birth and death, which refers to the conditions of birth and death, namely the afflictions of the stage of nescience, which can produce new pure karma. It is like the ignorance within the three realms giving rise to karmic activity. Because afflictions give rise to wisdom, which are not of the same kind, it is called expedient.
['ZH_T36_1736_028:0210c23_7']	二因緣生死，謂生死因，即上無明所生無漏有分別業，譬如無明所生行業，但感同類，故名因緣。	二因緣生死，謂生死因，即上無明所生無漏有分別業，譬如無明所生行業，但感同類，故名因緣。	028	Second, causal birth and death, which refers to the causes of birth and death, namely the pure karma with discrimination produced by the above nescience. It is like the karmic activity produced by nescience, which only attracts the same kind, and is therefore called causal.
['ZH_T36_1736_028:0210c25_4']	三有有生死，即由前因緣感得變易、異熟有果，如三界內以有漏業感六趣身。	三有有生死，即由前因緣感得變易、異熟有果，如三界內以有漏業感六趣身。	028	Third, the birth and death of existence, which is due to the above causes and conditions, attracting the transformed retribution of the fruit of existence, like using contaminated karma within the three realms to attract the body of the six destinies.
['ZH_T36_1736_028:0210c26_1']	言有有者，未來生有，更有一生故。	言有有者，未來生有，更有一生故。	028	As for the existence of existence, there is another life in the future existence.

['ZH_T36_1736_028:0210c29_11']	四無有生死，即改變易脫，譬如生為緣，有老死等過患，一期報謝更無有有，故名無有。	四無有生死，即改變易脫，譬如生為緣，有老死等過患，一期報謝更無有有，故名無有。	028	The fourth is without existence and death, which means changing and transforming, like birth being the condition for the faults of old age and death, and once the retribution of a period is over, there is no more existence, thus it is called non-existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_028:0211a01_7']	故今疏云「唯有第四無有生死」。	故今疏云「唯有第四無有生死」。	028	Therefore, the commentary now says: There is only the fourth without existence and death.
