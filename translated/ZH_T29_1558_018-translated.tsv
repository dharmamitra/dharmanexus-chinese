This offense of breaking the Sangha is by nature false speech, namely the manifest and unmanifest actions of speech that arise together with the breaking of the Sangha. This person will certainly experience extremely heavy suffering in the Avīci hell for one intermediate kalpa.

It is necessary for the Saṅgha to be broken by those who accept a teacher other than the Buddha, and who accept a path other than the one taught by the Buddha.
