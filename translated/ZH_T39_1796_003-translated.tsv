This is still the answer to the previous phrase on the characteristics of the mind.

Bound by deluded thoughts, karma, and afflictions, all their sense faculties are closed. Reaching these six sense bases is like being reborn again, so it is called a place of respite.

This means that when contemplating only the aggregates and no-self, one analyzes the various aspects within the aggregates, sense bases, and elements, and the self cannot be found.

This means that when the practitioner's mind abides within the aggregates, wishing to give rise to detachment, at that time, contemplating the aggregates as empty using analogies such as illusions and flames, one becomes free from the eight minds of opposition and compliance and realizes the realm of tranquility.

This is the mind of the vehicle without conditions, observing the nature of the selflessness of dharmas. Outside the mind, there are no images or wisdom to be attained at all. The king of the mind is self-mastery, realizing the originally unborn, attaining liberation from the bonds of dharmas, and attaining a place of relief in the selflessness of dharmas.

['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606a25_15']	於業煩惱等，都無所縛亦無所脫，故云得一切法自性平等。	於業煩惱等，都無所縛亦無所脫，故云得一切法自性平等。	003	One is not bound by karma, afflictions, and so forth, nor is one liberated from them. Therefore, it is said that one attains the equality of the intrinsic nature of all dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606a27_9']	爾時於有為無為界二種扼縛得蘇息處，即是真言行者虛空無垢菩提心也。	爾時於有為無為界二種扼縛得蘇息處，即是真言行者虛空無垢菩提心也。	003	At that time, one attains a place of respite from the two kinds of fetters in the realms of the conditioned and the unconditioned, which is the bodhicitta of emptiness and non-defilement of the practitioner of mantras.

Even the Tathāgata, observing with his five eyes, is unable to perceive its appearance, let alone other people in the midst of birth and death.
['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606b02_3']	今所以廣明三劫六無畏處眾多心相者，皆是擬儀外迹，以明修證之深淺耳。	今所以廣明三劫六無畏處眾多心相者，皆是擬儀外迹，以明修證之深淺耳。	003	The reason for extensively explaining the many mental states in the three eons and six fearless stages is to illustrate the depths of cultivation and realization through external forms and symbols.

This is a brief answer to the phrase on practice in the previous question.
['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606b09_15']	如下文萬行方便中，無不藉此十緣生句淨除心垢，是故當知最為旨要，真言行者特宜留意思之。	如下文萬行方便中，無不藉此十緣生句淨除心垢，是故當知最為旨要，真言行者特宜留意思之。	003	As in the following text, among the expedient means of myriad practices, there is none that does not rely on these ten phrases on dependent origination to purify the defilements of the mind. Therefore, one should know that they are the most essential. Mantra practitioners should especially keep this in mind.

['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606b12_6']	一者以心沒蘊中，欲對治實法故，觀此十緣生句，如前所說即空之幻是也。	一者以心沒蘊中，欲對治實法故，觀此十緣生句，如前所說即空之幻是也。	003	First, when the mind is immersed in the aggregates, in order to counteract the grasping of real dharmas, one contemplates these ten phrases of dependent origination as the emptiness that is illusion, as explained above.
['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606b14_7']	二者以心沒法中，欲對治境界攀緣故，觀此十緣生句，如前所說蘊阿賴耶即心之幻是也。	二者以心沒法中，欲對治境界攀緣故，觀此十緣生句，如前所說蘊阿賴耶即心之幻是也。	003	Second, when the mind is immersed in dharmas, in order to counteract the grasping of objects, one contemplates these ten phrases of dependent origination as the aggregates that are the ālaya-vijñāna, which is the mind that is illusion, as explained above.
['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606b17_4']	三者以深著沒心實際中，欲離有為無為界故，觀此十緣生句，如前所說解脫一切業煩惱而業煩惱具依，即不思議之幻也。	三者以深著沒心實際中，欲離有為無為界故，觀此十緣生句，如前所說解脫一切業煩惱而業煩惱具依，即不思議之幻也。	003	Third, when deeply attached and immersed in the reality of the mind, in order to leave behind the realm of conditioned and unconditioned, one contemplates these ten phrases of dependent origination as the inconceivable illusion, which is liberated from all karmic afflictions while still possessing karmic afflictions and their basis, as explained above.

The causes and conditions of the response are the manifestation of the body that Vairocana delights in seeing and the teaching that is suitable to hear. However, one's own mind is ultimately pure, and the Buddha's mind is also ultimately pure.

Discussing illusion is called the inconceivable illusion.
['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606b28_11']	復次言深修者，謂得淨心已去，從大悲生根，乃至方便究竟，其間一一緣起皆當以十喻觀之。	復次言深修者，謂得淨心已去，從大悲生根，乃至方便究竟，其間一一緣起皆當以十喻觀之。	003	Furthermore, as for deep cultivation, it refers to after attaining the pure mind, from the roots born of great compassion up to the ultimate skillful means, in between each dependent origination should be contemplated with the ten metaphors.

['ZH_T39_1796_003:0606c05_4']	今行者於一念淨心中通達如是塵沙四諦，空則畢竟不生、有則盡其性相、中則舉體皆常，以三法無定相，故名為不思議幻。	今行者於一念淨心中通達如是塵沙四諦，空則畢竟不生、有則盡其性相、中則舉體皆常，以三法無定相，故名為不思議幻。	003	Now the practitioner penetrates such dust-like four truths in a single thought of pure mind. Emptiness is ultimately unborn, existence exhausts its nature and characteristics, and the middle is the entirety of permanence. Because the three dharmas have no fixed characteristics, they are called the inconceivable illusion.
