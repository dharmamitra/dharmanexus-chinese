['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424a27_7']	〈方便品〉云「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相。	〈方便品〉云「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相。	008	The chapter on skillful means says, All dharmas from the beginning are always characterized by quiescent extinction.

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b07_15']	十速疾得無生觀心無所礙，一念遍知。	十速疾得無生觀心無所礙，一念遍知。	008	Tenth, it is swift, as attaining the contemplation of non-arising has an unobstructed mind that knows everywhere in a single thought.

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b19_7']	初地至三地名信無生，四地至六地名順無生，七地至九地謂真無生，十地至佛地謂寂滅無生，即喻四轉輪王也。	初地至三地名信無生，四地至六地名順無生，七地至九地謂真無生，十地至佛地謂寂滅無生，即喻四轉輪王也。	008	The first to third grounds are called the stage of faith in non-arising, the fourth to sixth grounds are called the stage of conforming to non-arising, the seventh to ninth grounds are called the stage of true non-arising, and the tenth ground to Buddha ground are called the stage of quiescent extinction of non-arising, which are likened to the four kinds of wheel-turning kings.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b19_15']	又地前亦具四位：	又地前亦具四位：	008	Moreover, the stages prior to the grounds also have four stages:

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b22_8']	後四名似輪，前四名真輪。	後四名似輪，前四名真輪。	008	The latter four are called similar wheels, and the former four are called true wheels.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b23_5']	似中內外凡，真中竝不竝，如一乘中釋。	似中內外凡，真中竝不竝，如一乘中釋。	008	Within the similar, there are outer and inner commoners, and within the true, there are both together and not together, as explained in the One Vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b25_11']	《般若》云「菩薩初發心，皆學無所得」，以無所得故，能從一位至一位耳。	《般若》云「菩薩初發心，皆學無所得」，以無所得故，能從一位至一位耳。	008	The Prajnaparamita Sutra says, Bodhisattvas who first generate the mind all study non-attainment, and because of non-attainment, they can proceed from one stage to the next.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b26_12']	「有所得是魔眷屬無道無果」，是故皆學無生。	「有所得是魔眷屬無道無果」，是故皆學無生。	008	Those who grasp at existence are the retinue of Mara, without the Way and without fruition, therefore, all should learn non-arising.

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424b29_5']	是故經云「動心是魔網，不動為法印」也。	是故經云「動心是魔網，不動為法印」也。	008	Therefore, the sutra says: A moving mind is Mara's net, an unmoving mind is the seal of the Dharma.

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c01_5']	既以無生為輪，即以無轉為轉也。	既以無生為輪，即以無轉為轉也。	008	Since non-arising is taken as the wheel, then non-turning is taken as turning.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c02_5']	《淨名》云「三轉法輪於大千，其輪本來常清淨。	《淨名》云「三轉法輪於大千，其輪本來常清淨。	008	The Vimalakirti Sutra says: The wheel of the Dharma is turned three times in the great chiliocosm, and that wheel is originally always pure.

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c09_4']	一者法身成佛，謂坐無生觀道場將滿不二念，若假諸佛為作因緣，故無生觀輪於心中轉，名為他轉。	一者法身成佛，謂坐無生觀道場將滿不二念，若假諸佛為作因緣，故無生觀輪於心中轉，名為他轉。	008	First, becoming a buddha with the Dharma body, referring to sitting in the contemplation of non-arising, about to complete the site of enlightenment, with no second thought. If the buddhas act as conditions for him, then the wheel of contemplation of non-arising turns in his mind, called turning by others.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c10_12']	二者應身成佛，謂十地行滿坐於道場，無師自悟名為自轉也。	二者應身成佛，謂十地行滿坐於道場，無師自悟名為自轉也。	008	Second, becoming a buddha with the reward body, referring to completing the practices of the ten grounds and sitting at the site of enlightenment, awakening by oneself without a teacher, called turning by oneself.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c11_4']	此二皆是大乘，三藏所無。	此二皆是大乘，三藏所無。	008	These two are both of the Mahayana, not found in the Tripiṭaka.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c12_19']	次明三僧祇劫行滿，三十四心成佛，亦無師自悟，得眼智明覺，此三藏成佛。	次明三僧祇劫行滿，三十四心成佛，亦無師自悟，得眼智明覺，此三藏成佛。	008	Next, clarifying the completion of practices over three incalculably long eons and becoming a buddha in thirty-four mental states, also awakening by oneself without a teacher, attaining the eye, wisdom, illumination, and enlightenment, this is the Tripiṭaka's becoming a buddha.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c13_8']	成佛雖多，不出此三。	成佛雖多，不出此三。	008	Although there are many ways of becoming a buddha, they do not go beyond these three.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c14_4']	若以本迹而言，初一為本、後二為迹。	若以本迹而言，初一為本、後二為迹。	008	If speaking in terms of the original and traces, the first is the original, and the latter two are the traces.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c14_19']	大小為論，初二大乘、後一三藏。	大小為論，初二大乘、後一三藏。	008	In terms of Mahayana and Hinayana, the first two are Mahayana, and the last one is Hinayana.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c15_8']	權實而言，三藏辨權；	權實而言，三藏辨權；	008	In terms of expedient and true, Hinayana is expedient;
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c16_8']	大乘有權有實，法身為實成，迹身為權成也。	大乘有權有實，法身為實成，迹身為權成也。	008	Mahayana has expedient and true. The Dharma body is true accomplishment, and the trace body is expedient accomplishment.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c17_1']	次就應身成佛，復有自他。	次就應身成佛，復有自他。	008	Next, in terms of the response body becoming a Buddha, there is also self and other.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c18_9']	《婆娑》云「佛在菩提樹下轉自身法輪，謂自得無漏慧，行四諦境。	《婆娑》云「佛在菩提樹下轉自身法輪，謂自得無漏慧，行四諦境。	008	The Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra says, The Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma for his own body under the bodhi tree, referring to his own attainment of uncontaminated wisdom and practicing the four truths.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c20_3']	於鹿薗為他身轉法輪，謂陳如等有應發之慧，須佛言教為其扣發，名為他轉。	於鹿薗為他身轉法輪，謂陳如等有應發之慧，須佛言教為其扣發，名為他轉。	008	In the Deer Park, he turned the wheel of Dharma for others' bodies, referring to Kauṇḍinya and others who had wisdom that needed to be aroused. The Buddha's teachings struck and aroused them, called turning for others.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c20_18']	但自轉之義就初成道，此義則短；	但自轉之義就初成道，此義則短；	008	But the meaning of turning for oneself is based on the initial attainment of enlightenment, so this meaning is short;
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c21_14']	從爾已後皆屬他轉，故他轉時長。	從爾已後皆屬他轉，故他轉時長。	008	From then on, all belong to turning for others, so turning for others is long.

['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c23_3']	轉必有方所，即是轉境義。	轉必有方所，即是轉境義。	008	Turning must have a direction, which is the meaning of the realm of turning.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c24_3']	若爾，小乘生滅觀照四諦境，故輪於四方轉；	若爾，小乘生滅觀照四諦境，故輪於四方轉；	008	If so, the Hinayana turns the wheel in the four directions because the contemplation of arising and ceasing illuminates the four truths.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c24_18']	大乘明無生滅觀於一實諦方轉也。	大乘明無生滅觀於一實諦方轉也。	008	The Mahayana clarifies the contemplation of non-arising and non-ceasing turning the wheel in the one true reality.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c25_1']	問：	問：	008	Question:
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c25_6']	云何爾耶？	云何爾耶？	008	Why is it so?
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c25_8']	答：	答：	008	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c26_4']	小乘以苦集為相生，滅道為還滅。	小乘以苦集為相生，滅道為還滅。	008	The Hinayana takes suffering and accumulation as characteristics of arising, and cessation and the path as returning to cessation.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c26_14']	境即生滅，觀亦復然。	境即生滅，觀亦復然。	008	The object is arising and ceasing, and the contemplation is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c28_5']	故生滅境發生滅觀，生滅觀照生滅境，所以言生滅之輪四方轉也。	故生滅境發生滅觀，生滅觀照生滅境，所以言生滅之輪四方轉也。	008	Therefore, the object of arising and ceasing gives rise to the contemplation of cessation, and the contemplation of arising and ceasing illuminates the object of arising and ceasing. This is why it is said that the wheel of arising and ceasing turns in the four directions.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0424c29_12']	大乘則明不苦不集故不生，不道不滅故無滅，故名一諦。	大乘則明不苦不集故不生，不道不滅故無滅，故名一諦。	008	The Mahayana clarifies that because there is no suffering and no accumulation, there is no arising. Because there is no path and no cessation, there is no ceasing. Therefore, it is called the one truth.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0425a02_14']	以無生滅一諦發不生滅一觀，無生滅一觀照無生滅一境，故云無生滅輪於一諦方轉也。	以無生滅一諦發不生滅一觀，無生滅一觀照無生滅一境，故云無生滅輪於一諦方轉也。	008	The non-arising and non-ceasing one contemplation arises from the non-arising and non-ceasing one truth. The non-arising and non-ceasing one contemplation illuminates the non-arising and non-ceasing one object. Therefore, it is said that the wheel of non-arising and non-ceasing turns in the one truth.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0425a04_13']	然轉輪既是無轉而轉，境生亦無生而生，無轉而轉雖轉不照，無生而生雖生不發也。	然轉輪既是無轉而轉，境生亦無生而生，無轉而轉雖轉不照，無生而生雖生不發也。	008	However, since the turning of the wheel is non-turning yet turning, the arising of the realm is also non-arising yet arising. Although non-turning yet turning, it turns without illuminating; although non-arising yet arising, it arises without giving rise.
['ZH_T34_1720_008:0425a06_10']	次明小乘之輪於四方轉，大乘亦爾，但小乘於有量四方轉，大乘於無量四方轉。	次明小乘之輪於四方轉，大乘亦爾，但小乘於有量四方轉，大乘於無量四方轉。	008	Next, it is explained that the wheel of the Lesser Vehicle turns in the four directions, and the Great Vehicle is also like this.
