['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a14_17']	多弟子已成熟，純陀未成熟，佛為純陀未成熟故，顯示大般涅槃，講說大經，受大功德，為成熟故來拘尸那城。	多弟子已成熟，純陀未成熟，佛為純陀未成熟故，顯示大般涅槃，講說大經，受大功德，為成熟故來拘尸那城。	001	Many disciples have already matured, while Pure Giving has not yet matured. The Buddha, for the sake of Pure Giving who has not yet matured, manifests the great parinirvāṇa, expounds the great sūtra, receives the great merit, and comes to the city of Kuśinagara for the sake of maturing him.

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a16_5']	一、見同相未見別相生疑心；	一、見同相未見別相生疑心；	001	First, seeing the common characteristics but not yet seeing the distinct characteristics gives rise to doubt;
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a16_15']	二見別相不見同相故。	二見別相不見同相故。	001	Second, seeing the distinct characteristics but not seeing the common characteristics, therefore,
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a17_15', 'ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a18_13']	起疑心者，如遙見杌，疑為是人、為是杌？🔽若見烏鳥集上，鹿從其下過，知是杌非人；	起疑心者，如遙見杌，疑為是人、為是杌？ 若見烏鳥集上，鹿從其下過，知是杌非人；	001	gives rise to doubt. It is like seeing a stump in the distance and doubting whether it is a person or a stump.🔽If one sees crows gathering on top of it and deer passing under it, one knows it is a stump and not a person;
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a19_6']	若見舉手挑衣者，知人非杌。	若見舉手挑衣者，知人非杌。	001	If one sees someone raising their hand to pick up their clothes, one knows it is a person and not a stump.

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a22_8']	聲聞者不共相，於聲聞不共相生疑，為同空是常住、為同地是無常？	聲聞者不共相，於聲聞不共相生疑，為同空是常住、為同地是無常？	001	The śrāvakas have the uncommon characteristics, and doubt arises in the uncommon characteristics of the śrāvakas, whether they are the same as space and permanent, or the same as earth and impermanent.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a23_10']	凡夫為同相故起疑心，聲聞緣覺為別相故起疑心。	凡夫為同相故起疑心，聲聞緣覺為別相故起疑心。	001	Ordinary people give rise to doubt because of the common characteristics, while śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas give rise to doubt because of the specific characteristics.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a24_16']	凡夫為有生法故起疑心，聲聞緣覺為無生法故起疑心。	凡夫為有生法故起疑心，聲聞緣覺為無生法故起疑心。	001	Ordinary people give rise to doubt because of the dharmas that arise, while śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas give rise to doubt because of the dharmas that do not arise.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281a26_2']	純陀不為此二種故起疑心，為欲利益眾生故生此疑。	純陀不為此二種故起疑心，為欲利益眾生故生此疑。	001	Cunda does not give rise to doubt because of these two kinds, but gives rise to this doubt in order to benefit sentient beings.

Some non-Buddhists say that the Buddha dies and is reborn again, some say that he is like a lamp going out when the oil is exhausted, and some say that after the Buddha's extinction, there is both exhaustion and non-exhaustion.

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b04_18']	煩惱縛生得，解縛修得。	煩惱縛生得，解縛修得。	001	The bonds of afflictions are born and attained, and liberation from bonds is attained through cultivation.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b05_8']	生死生得，涅槃修得。	生死生得，涅槃修得。	001	Birth and death are born and attained, and nirvana is attained through cultivation.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b05_21']	本生今修，本是生、今是修。	本生今修，本是生、今是修。	001	What was originally born is now cultivated; what was originally born is now cultivated.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b07_5']	為二乘作此解說不謗大乘，為大乘作此解說是謗大乘。	為二乘作此解說不謗大乘，為大乘作此解說是謗大乘。	001	This explanation for the sake of the two vehicles does not slander the Mahayana, but this explanation for the sake of the Mahayana is a slander of the Mahayana.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b08_2']	此是不相應大乘，誰能令相應大乘？	此是不相應大乘，誰能令相應大乘？	001	This is an incompatible Mahayana. Who can make the Mahayana compatible?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b09_15']	是故我等依義選擇思惟義，不依語言不選擇思惟語言，為修行大乘者說。	是故我等依義選擇思惟義，不依語言不選擇思惟語言，為修行大乘者說。	001	Therefore, we rely on the meaning to select and contemplate the meaning, not relying on language and not selecting and contemplating language, and speak for those who practice the Mahayana.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b11_1']	過三種義，顯了別義，言本有今無、本無今有、三時有。	過三種義，顯了別義，言本有今無、本無今有、三時有。	001	Transcending the three kinds of meanings, it manifests the distinct meaning, saying that what was originally existent now does not exist, what was originally non-existent now exists, and that there is existence in the three times.

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b13_18']	性不定住故，以前有後無故。	性不定住故，以前有後無故。	001	Because the nature does not abide stably, because what existed before does not exist later.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b14_12']	一切真有亦無，真有俗有亦無。	一切真有亦無，真有俗有亦無。	001	All true existence also does not exist, and true existence and conventional existence also do not exist.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b14_16']	何以故？	何以故？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b16_1']	真有前後無異故，俗有無本故，是故真俗二義不成就。	真有前後無異故，俗有無本故，是故真俗二義不成就。	001	Because true existence does not differ before and after, and because conventional existence is originally non-existent, therefore the two meanings of true and conventional are not accomplished.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b18_1']	於此二義不明了，僧佉外道亦如是說因中有果，譬如乳有酪生酥等，是增益僧佉等義。	於此二義不明了，僧佉外道亦如是說因中有果，譬如乳有酪生酥等，是增益僧佉等義。	001	Not clearly understanding these two meanings, the Sāṃkhya non-Buddhist path also says in this way that the effect exists in the cause, like milk having curds, fresh butter, and so forth, which is the meaning of increasing the Sāṃkhya and so forth.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b18_15']	若本無礙，現在時中誰能為障？	若本無礙，現在時中誰能為障？	001	If what was originally non-existent, who can create an obstruction in the present time?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b19_15']	若汝思惟妨礙因緣和合為障者，是義不然。	若汝思惟妨礙因緣和合為障者，是義不然。	001	If you think that the conditions of obstruction and combination are obstacles, this is not reasonable.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b20_1']	何以故？	何以故？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b20_7']	前後無異故。	前後無異故。	001	Because there is no difference between before and after.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b20_19']	若今不障，本時何故不障？	若今不障，本時何故不障？	001	If it is not an obstacle now, why was it not an obstacle before?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b21_17']	有何道理，本不依因緣生，後依那因緣滅？	有何道理，本不依因緣生，後依那因緣滅？	001	What logic is there that it was not originally produced from conditions, but later perishes due to conditions?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b22_8']	所言本者，以何法為本？	所言本者，以何法為本？	001	What is meant by original? What dharma is taken as the basis?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b22_19']	為初起、為當相續為本？	為初起、為當相續為本？	001	Is it the initial arising or the continuity that is taken as the basis?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b24_4']	若初起為本，初不為因緣所生，後如初亦不為因緣所生。	若初起為本，初不為因緣所生，後如初亦不為因緣所生。	001	If the initial arising is taken as the basis, the initial [arising] is not produced by conditions, and later [it] is also not produced by conditions, just like the initial [arising].
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b25_12']	若如是，說十二因緣法如如義，皆悉已破，則同外道說無因義。	若如是，說十二因緣法如如義，皆悉已破，則同外道說無因義。	001	If it is so, the meaning of the suchness of the twelve links of dependent arising is all destroyed, and it is the same as the non-cause theory of non-Buddhists.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b26_5']	若相續為本者，相續亦不定。	若相續為本者，相續亦不定。	001	If continuity is taken as the basis, continuity is also indefinite.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b26_9']	何以故？	何以故？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b26_15']	分分不定故。	分分不定故。	001	Because the parts are indefinite.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b27_2']	云何相續為本？	云何相續為本？	001	How can continuity be the basis?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b27_16']	是故一切有生之法，說本無因。	是故一切有生之法，說本無因。	001	Therefore, for all dharmas that arise, it is said that there is no cause in the original.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281b28_5']	如此說者則無道理。	如此說者則無道理。	001	To say this is unreasonable.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c01_12']	本無今有者，若前是無本而今有，有者則無得解脫者，前煩惱未起則是離解脫，而後生煩惱則無解脫。	本無今有者，若前是無本而今有，有者則無得解脫者，前煩惱未起則是離解脫，而後生煩惱則無解脫。	001	As for what was previously nonexistent now exists, if what was previously nonexistent now exists, then there would be no one who attains liberation. If afflictions had not arisen previously, then one would be liberated, but if afflictions arise later, then there would be no liberation.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c02_13']	若前無今有者，最極無生當應得生，如空生花。	若前無今有者，最極無生當應得生，如空生花。	001	If what was previously nonexistent now exists, then what is utterly unarisen should be able to arise, like a flower arising in the sky.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c03_3']	若汝思惟一則無因。	若汝思惟一則無因。	001	If you think that one is without a cause,

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c04_16']	如屋與花，二同是未有，何故因緣生屋、不因緣生花？	如屋與花，二同是未有，何故因緣生屋、不因緣生花？	001	It is like a house and a flower. The two are the same in being previously nonexistent. Why does a house arise from causes and conditions, while a flower does not arise from causes and conditions?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c05_2']	等是無故。	等是無故。	001	Because they are the same in being nonexistent.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c05_8']	是義無道理。	是義無道理。	001	This reasoning is unreasonable.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c06_3']	若本無生而今得生，則破本義。	若本無生而今得生，則破本義。	001	If what was previously unarisen now arises, then it contradicts the original meaning.

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c06_18']	初生是本故。	初生是本故。	001	Because the initial arising is the original.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c07_19']	若汝思惟因緣，是初生則非初，是故生非是本。	若汝思惟因緣，是初生則非初，是故生非是本。	001	If you think that the initial arising is not the initial because of causes and conditions, therefore arising is not the original,
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c08_4']	是亦不然。	是亦不然。	001	this is also not so.

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c09_3']	汝意欲破本有故，欲立因緣本者。	汝意欲破本有故，欲立因緣本者。	001	Because you intend to destroy the originally existent and establish the originally existent conditions.

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c11_9']	若具足生者，為一時生、為前後生？	若具足生者，為一時生、為前後生？	001	If it arises completely, does it arise simultaneously or sequentially?
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c12_4']	若一時生，則因果同時不可分別。	若一時生，則因果同時不可分別。	001	If it arises simultaneously, then cause and effect would occur at the same time and be indistinguishable.
['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c12_19']	若果後生，因在前滅，誰生後果？	若果後生，因在前滅，誰生後果？	001	If the effect arises after the cause has ceased, what produces the subsequent effect?

['ZH_T26_1528_001:0281c21_15']	離義故則無別時，是故三時皆不成就。	離義故則無別時，是故三時皆不成就。	001	Apart from meaning, there is no separate time. Therefore, the three times are all unestablished.
