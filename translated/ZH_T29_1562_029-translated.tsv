['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c13_4']	名無色四蘊。	名無色四蘊。	029	Name refers to the four formless aggregates.

['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c14_11']	佛說無色四蘊名名。	佛說無色四蘊名名。	029	The Buddha said that the four formless aggregates are called name.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c14_16']	何故名名？	何故名名？	029	Why is it called name?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c15_10']	能表召故，謂能表召種種所緣。	能表召故，謂能表召種種所緣。	029	Because it can express and summon, that is, it can express and summon various objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c16_9']	若爾，不應全攝無色不相應法，無所緣故。	若爾，不應全攝無色不相應法，無所緣故。	029	If that is so, it should not completely include the formless and non-associated dharmas, because they have no objects.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c17_8']	不爾，表召唯在無色，如釋色名，所說無過。	不爾，表召唯在無色，如釋色名，所說無過。	029	It is not so. Expressing and summoning only exists in the formless realm, just as explaining the name form, without any error.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c19_5']	佛說變礙故名為色，去來無表及諸極微，雖無變礙而得名色，以無色中無變礙故。	佛說變礙故名為色，去來無表及諸極微，雖無變礙而得名色，以無色中無變礙故。	029	The Buddha said that because it obstructs and changes, it is called form. Although past and future unmanifest form and subtle particles have no obstruction and change, they can be called form, because in the formless realm there is no obstruction and change.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c19_15']	變礙名色，非不極成。	變礙名色，非不極成。	029	The name form that obstructs and changes is not completely established.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c21_5']	如是無色中容有表召非色中有故，理亦無違，故不相應名攝無失。	如是無色中容有表召非色中有故，理亦無違，故不相應名攝無失。	029	Thus, in the formless realm, there may be intimation, because there is no form there. This is also reasonable and not contradictory. Therefore, there is no error in including non-associated [phenomena] in name.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c22_4']	又微細故，彼彼義中隨理立名、摽以名稱。	又微細故，彼彼義中隨理立名、摽以名稱。	029	Moreover, because it is subtle, it is given a name according to the principle in each case, and is designated as name.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c23_3']	非無表等亦可稱名，以彼所依現量得故。	非無表等亦可稱名，以彼所依現量得故。	029	Non-intimation, etc. can also be called name, because their basis is apprehended by direct perception.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c24_2']	又於一切界地趣生，能遍趣求，故立名稱。	又於一切界地趣生，能遍趣求，故立名稱。	029	Moreover, it is able to universally seek in all realms, stages, destinies, and births, and therefore it is established as name.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c25_3']	非無漏無色不得名名，雖非此所明而似此故。	非無漏無色不得名名，雖非此所明而似此故。	029	Non-outflows and formless [dharmas] cannot be called name, although they are not what is being discussed here, they are similar to this.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c26_2']	又於無色隨說者情，總說為名，不勞徵詰。	又於無色隨說者情，總說為名，不勞徵詰。	029	Moreover, in the formless realm, it is said in general according to the feelings of the speaker, and there is no need to question it.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c27_11']	上座意謂，順成彼彼有情相續，故說為名，是能為因，順成彼義。	上座意謂，順成彼彼有情相續，故說為名，是能為因，順成彼義。	029	The elder's idea is that it is called name because it conforms to and establishes the continuity of each sentient being, and it is able to be the cause, conforming to that meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c28_8']	若爾，色法應亦是名，亦能為因順成彼故。	若爾，色法應亦是名，亦能為因順成彼故。	029	If so, then form dharmas should also be called name, because they are also able to be the cause and conform to that.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0502c29_7']	佛說地等成有情身，經說士夫即六界故。	佛說地等成有情身，經說士夫即六界故。	029	The Buddha said that earth, etc. establish the bodies of sentient beings, because the sutra says that the person is precisely the six elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a02_5']	又無經說唯無色蘊成有情身，然有經言因色等起有情相續，故彼釋名無所憑據。	又無經說唯無色蘊成有情身，然有經言因色等起有情相續，故彼釋名無所憑據。	029	Moreover, there is no scripture that says only the formless aggregates constitute the body of sentient beings. However, there is a scripture that says the continuity of sentient beings is caused by form, etc. Therefore, their explanation of the name has no basis.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a02_14']	豈不佛說此伽他言：	豈不佛說此伽他言：	029	Isn't it that the Buddha said this verse:
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a03_14']	「名能映一切，　　無有過名者；	「名能映一切，　　無有過名者；	029	Name can overshadow everything, there is nothing that surpasses name;
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a04_13']	是故名一法，　　皆隨自在行。	是故名一法，　　皆隨自在行。	029	Therefore, in the one dharma of name, all follow its sovereign functioning.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a05_8']	」此中引彼何所證成？	」此中引彼何所證成？	029	What does this citation prove?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a06_9']	為彼頌中顯有情相續，唯用無色法為能成因？	為彼頌中顯有情相續，唯用無色法為能成因？	029	Does the verse show that the continuity of sentient beings is only accomplished by formless dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a07_11']	為顯無色強能引有色，於有情相續為能成因？	為顯無色強能引有色，於有情相續為能成因？	029	Or does it show that formless [dharmas] strongly attract form, and that formless [dharmas] are the accomplishing cause in the continuity of sentient beings?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a09_8']	若謂一切有情相續無不皆以無色為因，理亦不然，諸無心者但以有色成相續故。	若謂一切有情相續無不皆以無色為因，理亦不然，諸無心者但以有色成相續故。	029	If it is said that all the continuities of sentient beings are not accomplished by formless [dharmas], this is also unreasonable, because for those without mind, only form accomplishes the continuity.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a10_7']	無心有情，前已成立彼無得等為能成因。	無心有情，前已成立彼無得等為能成因。	029	It has already been established that sentient beings without mind do not have attainment, etc. as their accomplishing cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a11_17']	又一一有情，三界諸蘊成一相續，故諸色法亦是一切有情相續因。	又一一有情，三界諸蘊成一相續，故諸色法亦是一切有情相續因。	029	Moreover, each sentient being has the aggregates of the three realms as a single continuum, so the various material dharmas are also the causes of the continua of all sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a12_18']	不爾，則應不作而得、或作已失，便成太過。	不爾，則應不作而得、或作已失，便成太過。	029	Otherwise, one would either obtain without making or lose after making, which would be an overextension.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a13_16']	若一有情相續諸位色不遍者，無色亦同。	若一有情相續諸位色不遍者，無色亦同。	029	If the material dharmas of the various states of the continua of one sentient being were not universal, then the formless realm would be the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a15_5']	又應審思此伽他意，為說受等四蘊名名、為說能詮諸別相義？	又應審思此伽他意，為說受等四蘊名名、為說能詮諸別相義？	029	Moreover, one should carefully consider the meaning of this verse: does it say that the four aggregates such as feeling are called name, or does it say that that which can express the meanings of specific characteristics is called name?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a18_2']	如牛色等言依名名，然於此中唯應說彼能詮一切色非色名，唯此力能映一切法，以無一法非名所詮，異此何名能映一切？	如牛色等言依名名，然於此中唯應說彼能詮一切色非色名，唯此力能映一切法，以無一法非名所詮，異此何名能映一切？	029	It is like the term color of an ox, which is based on name and called name. However, in this case, it should only say that which can express the names of all material and immaterial dharmas is called name. Only this has the power to surpass all dharmas, because there is not a single dharma that is not expressed by name. Apart from this, what name can surpass all?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a19_1']	又十二處名一切法，受等何能映十二處？	又十二處名一切法，受等何能映十二處？	029	Moreover, the twelve sense bases are called all dharmas. How can feeling, etc. surpass the twelve sense bases?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a20_5']	若謂皆是受等所緣，則此中名唯目意識及相應法。	若謂皆是受等所緣，則此中名唯目意識及相應法。	029	If it is said that they are all the objects of feeling, etc., then the name in this case only refers to mental consciousness and its associated dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a24_10']	若謂所餘是名類故無斯過者，則不應引此頌證名為因順成有情相續，謂若唯意識及相應品，正是此伽他所說名者，則不應引證為因義，以五識身及相應品亦為因，順成有情相續故。	若謂所餘是名類故無斯過者，則不應引此頌證名為因順成有情相續，謂若唯意識及相應品，正是此伽他所說名者，則不應引證為因義，以五識身及相應品亦為因，順成有情相續故。	029	If you say that the other dharmas are called name because they are similar to it, then the error is not committed. But then you should not quote this verse as proof that name is the cause of the continuity of sentient beings. If only mental consciousness and its associated dharmas are called name in this verse, then you should not quote it as proof that name is the cause, because the five consciousnesses and their associated dharmas are also causes that assist in the continuity of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a26_8']	又如何說無過名者，若謂名中施設多蘊、色不過者，色中施設多界多處，名豈能過？	又如何說無過名者，若謂名中施設多蘊、色不過者，色中施設多界多處，名豈能過？	029	Also, how can you say that name is without error? If you say that many aggregates are established in name, and form is not so, then many elements and bases are established in form, so how can name be superior?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a27_6']	若謂名通無色有者，諸不通者應不名名。	若謂名通無色有者，諸不通者應不名名。	029	If you say that name is common to the formless realms, then those dharmas that are not common should not be called name.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503a28_15']	若謂不通是通種類無斯過者，理亦不然，前說不應引為證故。	若謂不通是通種類無斯過者，理亦不然，前說不應引為證故。	029	If you say that those that are not common are a kind of common dharma, and therefore there is no error, this is not so, because previously it was said that this verse should not be quoted as proof.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b01_13']	謂不通者，亦為因成有情相續，與通等故，除所執名，有何餘法可說彼諸法皆隨自在行？	謂不通者，亦為因成有情相續，與通等故，除所執名，有何餘法可說彼諸法皆隨自在行？	029	It is also a cause for the continuity of sentient beings who are not yet liberated, because it is the same as those who are liberated. Apart from the name that is grasped, what other dharma can be said to follow the activity of the sovereign?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b02_14']	若謂此名色隨行者，亦不應理，非極成故。	若謂此名色隨行者，亦不應理，非極成故。	029	If it is said that this name and form follow the activity, that is also unreasonable, because it is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b03_12']	謂許名色展轉相依，如何但言色隨名轉？	謂許名色展轉相依，如何但言色隨名轉？	029	It is said that name and form rely on each other. How can it only be said that form follows the transformation of name?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b04_14']	若謂名遍色、色不能遍名，理亦不然，非情無故。	若謂名遍色、色不能遍名，理亦不然，非情無故。	029	If it is said that name pervades form, but form cannot pervade name, that is also unreasonable, because non-sentient beings do not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b05_5']	又前已說，有無心有情故。	又前已說，有無心有情故。	029	Moreover, it has already been said that there are sentient beings without mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b06_16']	亦非名色外有法隨名轉，經說所知法總有二，謂名與色，更無第三。	亦非名色外有法隨名轉，經說所知法總有二，謂名與色，更無第三。	029	Also, there is no dharma outside of name and form that follows the transformation of name. The sūtra says that the known dharmas are generally two: name and form, and there is no third.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b07_5']	又理不應四蘊名一。	又理不應四蘊名一。	029	Moreover, it is unreasonable for the four aggregates to be called one.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b08_3']	設許對色說一法言，然不見有定隨行法。	設許對色說一法言，然不見有定隨行法。	029	Even if it is allowed that the word one dharma refers to form, we do not see any definite accompanying dharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b09_2']	不可自體隨自體行，故知此名唯能詮想。	不可自體隨自體行，故知此名唯能詮想。	029	The essence cannot follow the essence, therefore we know that this name only expresses thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b10_1']	若作此解，無假劬勞釋此伽他，義皆明了；	若作此解，無假劬勞釋此伽他，義皆明了；	029	If we interpret it in this way, there is no need to expend effort in explaining this verse, as the meaning becomes clear.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b10_19']	引之將證四蘊名名成有情身，定不應理。	引之將證四蘊名名成有情身，定不應理。	029	To cite it as evidence that the four aggregates are called name and constitute the sentient body is definitely unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b11_8']	上座於此假設難言：	上座於此假設難言：	029	The Sthavira raises a hypothetical objection:
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b12_19']	若名色言總攝五蘊，世尊說識依名色故，識則應有二，謂能依所依。	若名色言總攝五蘊，世尊說識依名色故，識則應有二，謂能依所依。	029	If the term name-and-form comprehensively includes the five aggregates, since the World-Honored One says that consciousness depends on name-and-form, then consciousness would have two aspects: the dependent and the basis of dependence.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b13_4']	即自釋言：	即自釋言：	029	He himself explains:
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b13_18']	此難非理，已於名中間出識故。	此難非理，已於名中間出識故。	029	This objection is unreasonable, because consciousness has already been brought up in the middle of the term name.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b15_1']	謂已舉識說為能依，准知識所依但取餘名色。	謂已舉識說為能依，准知識所依但取餘名色。	029	That is to say, consciousness has already been brought up as the dependent, so it is understood that the basis of consciousness's dependence only takes the remaining name-and-form.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b16_2']	今詳彼難，理自不成，等無間緣依，識定依識故。	今詳彼難，理自不成，等無間緣依，識定依識故。	029	Now, examining his objection, the principle is not established by itself, because the immediately preceding condition definitely depends on consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b17_12']	然彼上座不許同時識與名色有相依理，彼宗不許有同時因果故。	然彼上座不許同時識與名色有相依理，彼宗不許有同時因果故。	029	However, the Sthavira does not allow that consciousness and name-and-form simultaneously have the principle of mutual dependence, because his school does not allow for simultaneous cause and effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b18_11']	如何以識無二俱生，遂令識無還依識義？	如何以識無二俱生，遂令識無還依識義？	029	How can it be that because consciousness does not arise simultaneously in two [aspects], it is then said that consciousness does not have the meaning of depending on consciousness again?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b20_13']	又設許有俱生相依，但可識為受等所依性，不可受等與識為所依，如何識所依可取餘名色？	又設許有俱生相依，但可識為受等所依性，不可受等與識為所依，如何識所依可取餘名色？	029	Also, even if you admit that consciousness and the other four are mutually supported, consciousness can be the support of feeling, etc., but feeling, etc., cannot be the support of consciousness. How can the support of consciousness be called name-and-form?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b21_3']	故彼問答皆不應理。	故彼問答皆不應理。	029	Therefore the questions and answers of the opponent are unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b23_3']	今於此中應更思擇，佛於城喻大緣起經說識與名色更互為緣義，為據前後、為約俱生？	今於此中應更思擇，佛於城喻大緣起經說識與名色更互為緣義，為據前後、為約俱生？	029	We must now consider the meaning of the Buddha’s statement in the Mahāyāna Mahāpari nirvāṇa Sūtra, the Parable of the City, that consciousness and name-and-form are conditions for each other. Does this refer to a sequential relation or to a simultaneous relation?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b24_2']	識緣名色亦據前後，名色緣識唯約俱生。	識緣名色亦據前後，名色緣識唯約俱生。	029	Consciousness as a condition for name-and-form refers to a sequential relation, but name-and-form as a condition for consciousness refers only to a simultaneous relation.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b24_7']	所以者何？	所以者何？	029	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b25_14']	識入母胎故，與羯剌藍合，成有情身，故識緣名色亦得有前後。	識入母胎故，與羯剌藍合，成有情身，故識緣名色亦得有前後。	029	Because consciousness enters the mother’s womb and combines with the kalala, forming the body of a sentient being, therefore consciousness as a condition for name-and-form can be sequential.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b27_2']	非名色合已更結餘識，非識未已起名色為緣，故唯約俱生。	非名色合已更結餘識，非識未已起名色為緣，故唯約俱生。	029	But once name-and-form combine, they do not form another consciousness, and if consciousness has not yet arisen, name-and-form are not its condition. Therefore the relation is only simultaneous.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b27_14']	有名色緣識，識支唯一故。	有名色緣識，識支唯一故。	029	There is a name-and-form as a condition for consciousness, because the member of consciousness is only one.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503b29_15']	又一剎那故，謂次第說緣起支中但一識支，此唯一念，如何可執識與名色定約前後說互為緣？	又一剎那故，謂次第說緣起支中但一識支，此唯一念，如何可執識與名色定約前後說互為緣？	029	Also, because they are in the same moment. That is, in the twelve members of conditioned arising, only one member, consciousness, is said to be in the same moment. How can you insist that consciousness and name-and-form are definitely said to be in different time periods and to be conditions for each other?
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503c01_2']	又契經說：	又契經說：	029	Also, a scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503c01_7']	如蘆束故。	如蘆束故。	029	Because they are like bundles of reeds.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503c01_12']	謂契經言：	謂契經言：	029	A scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0503c02_7']	如二蘆束立在空地，展轉為依。	如二蘆束立在空地，展轉為依。	029	Two bundles of reeds stand leaning against each other.

Since it cannot be known, it also cannot be established.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0506b14_2']	若作如是分別經義，名色緣觸即二緣觸。	若作如是分別經義，名色緣觸即二緣觸。	029	If one analyzes the meaning of the sutra in this way, the contact that has name-and-form as its condition is precisely the two kinds of contact.

Since there is nothing that can be known, it also cannot be established.
['ZH_T29_1562_029:0506b25_8']	此義意言，離六所依等假觸無故，離六觸體外實觸亦無。	此義意言，離六所依等假觸無故，離六觸體外實觸亦無。	029	The meaning of this is that apart from the six supports, etc., there is no separate false contact, and apart from the six kinds of contact, there is also no real contact.
