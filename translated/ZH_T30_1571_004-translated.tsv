['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a14_4']	為破彼執，故復頌曰：	為破彼執，故復頌曰：	In order to refute this attachment, another verse is spoken:
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a15_14']	「諸法有轉變，　　慧者未曾知；	「諸法有轉變，　　慧者未曾知；	The transformation of dharmas, the wise have never known;

['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a17_2']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a18_18']	諸妙慧者能知一切障外極遠深細法義，未曾知有如是諸法轉變時分因果差別。	諸妙慧者能知一切障外極遠深細法義，未曾知有如是諸法轉變時分因果差別。	Those of wondrous wisdom can know all the extremely distant and subtle meanings of dharmas outside of the obstructions, which have never been known before. At the time of the transformation of these dharmas, there are distinctions in causes and effects.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a23_12']	唯除外道，如陰暗夜有眩醫人妄有所見，自不能了而為他說，言一切法實無生滅，但有時分因果轉變，所謂聲等或復樂等，不捨自體轉成餘相，時分不同名為轉變，於轉變時以時分相有差別故說有生滅。	唯除外道，如陰暗夜有眩醫人妄有所見，自不能了而為他說，言一切法實無生滅，但有時分因果轉變，所謂聲等或復樂等，不捨自體轉成餘相，時分不同名為轉變，於轉變時以時分相有差別故說有生滅。	Only excluding non-Buddhists, like a physician in the dark night who falsely sees something and is unable to understand it himself, yet explains it to others, saying that all dharmas are truly without arising and ceasing, but only at certain times are there distinctions in causes and effects that transform, namely sounds and so forth, or pleasure and so forth, not abandoning their own substance and transforming into other characteristics. At different times, it is called transformation. At the time of transformation, because the characteristics of time are different, it is said there is arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a24_3', 'ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a24_8']	汝今計何以為轉變？🔽為時體耶？	汝今計何以為轉變？ 為時體耶？	What do you now consider to be transformation?🔽Is it the substance of time?
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a24_13']	為時相耶？	為時相耶？	Or is it the characteristics of time?
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a26_1']	且不應說時體轉變，以轉變時汝先自執不捨自體，如前位故。	且不應說時體轉變，以轉變時汝先自執不捨自體，如前位故。	First, one should not say the substance of time transforms, because at the time of transformation, you previously yourself grasped without abandoning one's own substance, as in the previous state.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a27_8']	亦不應言時相轉變，汝執時相有生滅故，前後各別何名轉變。	亦不應言時相轉變，汝執時相有生滅故，前後各別何名轉變。	Nor can you say that the characteristics of time transform, because you hold that the characteristics of time have arising and cessation, and the prior and subsequent are each different. How can you speak of transformation?
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209a28_16']	又若時體不可轉變，但可時相有轉變者，應離時體別有時相。	又若時體不可轉變，但可時相有轉變者，應離時體別有時相。	Moreover, if the substance of time cannot transform, but only the characteristics of time can transform, then there must be characteristics of time apart from the substance of time.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b02_5']	若言體相非定一異，更互為依相從而說，相由體故前後非異，體由相故前後非一，體相相資俱名轉變。	若言體相非定一異，更互為依相從而說，相由體故前後非異，體由相故前後非一，體相相資俱名轉變。	If you say that substance and characteristics are not definitely the same or different, but mutually support each other, and are spoken of in terms of characteristics following the substance, then characteristics are not different before and after because of the substance, and the substance is not the same before and after because of the characteristics. Substance and characteristics mutually assist each other, and are both called transformation.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b05_3']	若爾則應體由相故有生有滅，相由體故無轉無變，體有生滅則同幻事非實非常，相無轉變則似空花非因非果，便失自宗。	若爾則應體由相故有生有滅，相由體故無轉無變，體有生滅則同幻事非實非常，相無轉變則似空花非因非果，便失自宗。	If that is so, then the substance must have arising and cessation because of the characteristics, and the characteristics must have no transformation or change because of the substance. If the substance has arising and cessation, then it is the same as an illusion, not real and not permanent. If the characteristics have no transformation, then they are like empty flowers, not a cause and not a result. You would lose your own position.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b06_6']	亦不應言體相性一，實無因果，由義異故得有因果。	亦不應言體相性一，實無因果，由義異故得有因果。	Nor can you say that substance and characteristics are the same in nature, but actually have no cause and effect, because they have different meanings and therefore can have cause and effect.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b06_16']	性若是一，義云何異？	性若是一，義云何異？	If the nature is the same, how can the meaning be different?
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b08_13']	一異不同應有別物，既有因果分位不同，先後各異應非轉變，電光燈焰無轉變故。	一異不同應有別物，既有因果分位不同，先後各異應非轉變，電光燈焰無轉變故。	If they are not the same, there must be a separate substance. Since cause and effect have different states, and earlier and later are different, they cannot be transformation, because lightning and lamp flames do not transform.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b10_10']	若言因果分位差別轉變有異，未必先後一體一時，有唯量等種種分位轉變異故。	若言因果分位差別轉變有異，未必先後一體一時，有唯量等種種分位轉變異故。	If it is said that the difference in states of cause and effect transforms and is different, it is not necessarily that earlier and later are the same substance at the same time, because there is only the various states of transformation such as quantity, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b11_19']	此有虛言而無實義，一法一時有生住滅，更互相違成大過故。	此有虛言而無實義，一法一時有生住滅，更互相違成大過故。	This has empty words but no real meaning, because one dharma at one time has arising, abiding, and ceasing, which mutually contradict and form a great error.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b13_3']	世間不見一法一時有生住滅，唯見異法異時有三。	世間不見一法一時有生住滅，唯見異法異時有三。	The world does not see one dharma at one time having arising, abiding, and ceasing, but only sees different dharmas at different times having three.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b14_2']	又不應言時體常有，雖無生滅而有轉變。	又不應言時體常有，雖無生滅而有轉變。	Also, it should not be said that the substance of time always exists, and although there is no arising or ceasing, there is transformation.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b15_1']	勿汝所執常住思我，雖無生滅亦有轉變。	勿汝所執常住思我，雖無生滅亦有轉變。	Do not let your grasped permanent thinking self, although without arising or ceasing, also have transformation.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b15_19']	設許思我亦有轉變，應如樂等非思我性。	設許思我亦有轉變，應如樂等非思我性。	Even if it is allowed that thinking self also has transformation, it should be like pleasure, etc., and not the nature of thinking self.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b18_6']	又許時體有轉變者，時體即是樂等自性，如是自性舉體應變，若爾則應失自宗義，最勝定無全體轉變。	又許時體有轉變者，時體即是樂等自性，如是自性舉體應變，若爾則應失自宗義，最勝定無全體轉變。	If you admit that the substance of time undergoes transformation, then the substance of time is identical to the nature of pleasure, etc., and in that case the entire substance would have to transform. If that were so, then you would lose the doctrine of your own school that the supreme and most excellent is absolutely without transformation.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b18_16']	若全轉變，即是無常。	若全轉變，即是無常。	If it does transform completely, then it would be impermanent.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b20_4']	又汝時分樂等三法和合共成，應如林等體非實有，因果亦爾。	又汝時分樂等三法和合共成，應如林等體非實有，因果亦爾。	Moreover, if time, pleasure, etc., and the three dharmas combine to form time, then time would be like a forest, etc., and its substance would not really exist. The same would be so of cause and effect.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b21_3']	若言即用樂等為性故是實有，此亦不然。	若言即用樂等為性故是實有，此亦不然。	If you say that because time uses pleasure, etc., as its nature, it really exists, this is also not so.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b22_2']	時等唯一，樂等有三，一三不同，如何相即？	時等唯一，樂等有三，一三不同，如何相即？	Time is unitary, and pleasure, etc., are threefold. How can the one and the three be identical?
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b23_5']	若必相即，樂等如時應唯有一，時如樂等應有其三。	若必相即，樂等如時應唯有一，時如樂等應有其三。	If they must be identical, then just as time is, so pleasure, etc., would be unitary. And just as pleasure, etc., are, so time would be threefold.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b24_4']	又如樂等遍一切時，此一一時應遍一切。	又如樂等遍一切時，此一一時應遍一切。	Moreover, just as pleasure, etc., are universal in all times, so each of these times would be universal in all.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b24_13']	如是時分應成雜亂。	如是時分應成雜亂。	In this way time would become confused and disordered.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b25_12']	時既一一不遍一切，樂等亦應不遍一切。	時既一一不遍一切，樂等亦應不遍一切。	Since time is not universal in all, pleasure, etc., would also not be universal in all.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b26_11']	如是樂等與無量時為自性故，應成無量。	如是樂等與無量時為自性故，應成無量。	Thus, pleasure, etc., would be infinite in quantity because they have infinite time as their intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b28_8']	又如樂等隱時亦有，此一一時應亦如是，則應無有隱顯差別，以一切時有一切故。	又如樂等隱時亦有，此一一時應亦如是，則應無有隱顯差別，以一切時有一切故。	Moreover, if pleasure, etc., exist even when they are hidden, then each of these times would also be like this, and there would be no difference between being hidden and being manifest, because all times would have all of them.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209b29_16']	由此不應決定相即，既不相即應計為假，或應不許樂等為性。	由此不應決定相即，既不相即應計為假，或應不許樂等為性。	For this reason, they should not definitely be identical. Since they are not identical, they should be considered to be provisional, or it should not be admitted that pleasure, etc., are intrinsic natures.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209c01_8']	如推時分，因果亦然。	如推時分，因果亦然。	As time is investigated, so too are causes and effects.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209c02_16']	又諸因果，或劣或勝、或淨或穢，云何同以一樂苦癡三法為性？	又諸因果，或劣或勝、或淨或穢，云何同以一樂苦癡三法為性？	Moreover, causes and effects are inferior or superior, pure or impure. How can they all have the same intrinsic nature of the three dharmas of pleasure, suffering, and delusion?
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209c04_6']	若必爾者，汝等外道無始時來無所不作，同以樂等為自性故。	若必爾者，汝等外道無始時來無所不作，同以樂等為自性故。	If this must be so, then you non-Buddhists have done everything since beginningless time, because they all have pleasure, etc., as their intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209c06_14']	汝等今者雖得人身，而應即是狗等下類，所食甘饌應即糞穢，誰有智者無緣執此外道邪宗而自毀辱？	汝等今者雖得人身，而應即是狗等下類，所食甘饌應即糞穢，誰有智者無緣執此外道邪宗而自毀辱？	Although you now have a human body, you should be the same as dogs and other inferior species, and the delicious food you eat should be the same as excrement. What wise person would grasp this non-Buddhist false doctrine without reason and bring disgrace upon themselves?
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209c08_4']	是故汝說果實不生其體本有，由轉變故立有時分因果差別。	是故汝說果實不生其體本有，由轉變故立有時分因果差別。	Therefore, your claim that the effect does not arise, but its substance originally exists, and that by transformation, time periods and distinctions of cause and effect are established,
['ZH_T30_1571_004:0209c08_14']	正理相違，不任推究。	正理相違，不任推究。	is contrary to correct principles and cannot withstand investigation.

Blind without the eyes of wisdom, they do not understand right and wrong, and follow deluded followers in various false attachments.
