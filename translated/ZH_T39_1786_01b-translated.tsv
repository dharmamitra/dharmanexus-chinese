Therefore, the sutras of the Buddha's lifetime do not go beyond the combination or non-combination of words and principles.

The conventional must eventually be eliminated, so the meaning of combination is not established.

If it connects with the shared and distinct teachings, the principle expounded already has all dharmas heading towards it. The text that illuminates the conventional is also all dharmas heading towards it. Therefore, these three kinds of true and conventional are non-dual, called the combination of text and principle, with the meaning of the middle way established.

The reason is that the expounded is not identical to the expounder, and is not called the middle way.
