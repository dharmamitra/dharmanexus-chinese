['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a17_12']	以諸如來無業煩惱同諸凡愚所造作生，故名無生。	以諸如來無業煩惱同諸凡愚所造作生，故名無生。	010	Because the tathāgatas are not born through karma and afflictions like ordinary foolish people, it is called no birth.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a18_13']	然有與此相違之生，其相難了，名生甚深。	然有與此相違之生，其相難了，名生甚深。	010	However, there is a kind of birth that is contrary to this, and its characteristics are difficult to understand, so it is called the profound birth.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a19_6']	亦無住為住者，顯住甚深。	亦無住為住者，顯住甚深。	010	Also, there is no abiding for one who abides, which shows the profundity of abiding.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a20_5']	無住涅槃以為住處，如是涅槃名住甚深。	無住涅槃以為住處，如是涅槃名住甚深。	010	The nirvāṇa without abiding is taken as the abode, and such nirvāṇa is called the profound abiding.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a21_16']	諸事無功用者，顯業甚深，以諸如來無功用業，一切等故名業甚深。	諸事無功用者，顯業甚深，以諸如來無功用業，一切等故名業甚深。	010	The effortless activity of all things shows the profundity of activity, because the effortless activity of all tathāgatas is equal, so it is called the profundity of activity.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a23_11']	第四食為食者，顯住甚深，以佛所食是不清淨依止住等四種食中第四食故。	第四食為食者，顯住甚深，以佛所食是不清淨依止住等四種食中第四食故。	010	The fourth food is food, which shows the profundity of abiding, because the food of the Buddha is the fourth food among the four kinds of food, which are not pure support for abiding, etc.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a25_7']	四種食者，一、不清淨依止住食，謂段等四食，令欲纏有情不淨依止而得住故。	四種食者，一、不清淨依止住食，謂段等四食，令欲纏有情不淨依止而得住故。	010	The four kinds of food are: 1. The food that is not pure support for abiding, which refers to the four foods such as morsels, because they enable sentient beings in the desire realm to abide in an impure support.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a27_3']	二、淨不淨依止住食，謂觸等三食，令色無色纏有情淨不淨依止而得住故。	二、淨不淨依止住食，謂觸等三食，令色無色纏有情淨不淨依止而得住故。	010	2. The food that is pure and impure support for abiding, which refers to the three foods such as contact, because they enable sentient beings in the form and formless realms to abide in a pure and impure support.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374a29_7']	由此依止已離下地諸煩惱故說名為淨，未離上地諸煩惱故說名不淨，是故名淨不淨依止。	由此依止已離下地諸煩惱故說名為淨，未離上地諸煩惱故說名不淨，是故名淨不淨依止。	010	Because it is free from the passions of the lower stages, it is said to be pure, and because it is not free from the passions of the higher stages, it is said to be impure. Therefore it is said to be a pure and impure support.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374b01_8']	如是依止由觸意思識食而住，除其段食。	如是依止由觸意思識食而住，除其段食。	010	This support is maintained by contact, intention, and consciousness as nutriments, excluding the nutriment of material food.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374b02_16']	三、一向淨依止住食，謂段等四食，令聲聞等清淨依止而得住故。	三、一向淨依止住食，謂段等四食，令聲聞等清淨依止而得住故。	010	Third is the nutriment that maintains a support that is exclusively pure, that is, the four nutriments of material food, etc., because they cause the pure support of sravakas, etc., to be maintained.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374b04_2']	四、唯示現依止住食，謂即四食，諸佛示現受之得住。	四、唯示現依止住食，謂即四食，諸佛示現受之得住。	010	Fourth is the nutriment that maintains a support that is only manifested, that is, the four nutriments that the buddhas manifest and receive in order to be maintained.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374b06_14']	是故諸佛食此第四示現住食，為令能施諸有情類淨信為因福德增長，雖現受食不作食事，如來食時諸天受取。	是故諸佛食此第四示現住食，為令能施諸有情類淨信為因福德增長，雖現受食不作食事，如來食時諸天受取。	010	Therefore the buddhas receive the fourth nutriment that is manifested in order to cause the merit of sentient beings who are able to give to increase through the cause of pure faith. Although they manifest the act of receiving food, they do not perform the function of eating, and when the Tathāgata eats, the celestials receive it.
['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374b08_1']	施佛意許諸餘有情，由此因故，彼有情類速證菩提。	施佛意許諸餘有情，由此因故，彼有情類速證菩提。	010	The intention of giving to the Buddha is to cause other sentient beings to quickly realize bodhi through this cause.

['ZH_T31_1597_010:0374b23_4']	復由十因，應知諸佛無功用事而得成立，一妙斷離故、二無所依故、三所作無功用故、四作者無功用故、五作業無功用故、六無所有無功用故、七本來無差別故、八所作已辦故、九所作未辦故、十純熟修習一切法中得自在故。	復由十因，應知諸佛無功用事而得成立，一妙斷離故、二無所依故、三所作無功用故、四作者無功用故、五作業無功用故、六無所有無功用故、七本來無差別故、八所作已辦故、九所作未辦故、十純熟修習一切法中得自在故。	010	Moreover, it should be understood that the effortless activities of the buddhas are established by ten causes: because of marvelous elimination and separation, because of nonreliance, because of the effortless activity of what is done, because of the effortless doer, because of the effortless activity, because of the nonexistence of effort, because of the original absence of discrimination, because of the completion of what was to be done, because of the incompletion of what was to be done, and because of mastery in the cultivation of all dharmas.
