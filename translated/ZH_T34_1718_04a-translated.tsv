['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0045c28_2']	又合譬於一佛乘分別說三，即是法說；	又合譬於一佛乘分別說三，即是法說；	04a	Moreover, the combined parables in the one Buddha vehicle are explained in three ways, which is the teaching of the Dharma;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0045c28_20']	「於二萬億佛所常教化汝」，即因緣說。	「於二萬億佛所常教化汝」，即因緣說。	04a	In the presence of two myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, I have always been teaching and transforming you, is the causal explanation.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a01_11']	若謂此文屬法說者，可取長者聞已驚入火宅方宜救濟，即因緣說。	若謂此文屬法說者，可取長者聞已驚入火宅方宜救濟，即因緣說。	04a	If it is said that this passage belongs to the teaching of the Dharma, then it can be taken that when the elder heard this, he was startled and entered the burning house to devise a plan to save [his children], which is the causal explanation.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a03_7']	下周別名宿世因緣，通亦具三，「涅槃時到眾又清淨令入佛慧」，是法說；	下周別名宿世因緣，通亦具三，「涅槃時到眾又清淨令入佛慧」，是法說；	04a	The lower chapter is specifically called the causes and conditions of past events, but generally it also includes the three [meanings]. The time of nirvana has arrived and the assembly is pure, causing them to enter the Buddha's wisdom, is the teaching of the Dharma;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a05_5']	「有一導師」是譬說，而作三周者，從多從正，從略從傍，欲令名字不濫，各據一意耳。	「有一導師」是譬說，而作三周者，從多從正，從略從傍，欲令名字不濫，各據一意耳。	04a	There is a guide is the parable, and it is said to have three periods. It is based on the majority, the correct, the brief, and the indirect. It is to prevent the names from being confused, and each is based on one meaning.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a05_7']	問：	問：	04a	Question:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a06_10']	三周為三根人，一周通有三說者，一說應具三根？	三周為三根人，一周通有三說者，一說應具三根？	04a	If the three periods are for people of the three capacities, and each period has the three teachings, then each teaching should have the three capacities?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a06_12']	答：	答：	04a	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a08_9']	法說非止逗上中之上，又有中下，從正略傍，故言逗上根人耳，餘二周亦如是。	法說非止逗上中之上，又有中下，從正略傍，故言逗上根人耳，餘二周亦如是。	04a	The doctrinal explanation is not only for those of the highest capacity, but also for those of the middle and lower capacities. It is based on the correct and brief, and is indirect. Therefore, it is said to be for those of the highest capacity. The other two periods are also like this.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a10_2']	二、明有聲聞、無聲聞者，光宅定有實行聲聞，若言無實，權何所應。	二、明有聲聞、無聲聞者，光宅定有實行聲聞，若言無實，權何所應。	04a	Second, clarifying whether there are shravakas or not. Guangzhai is certain that there are actually practicing shravakas. If it is said there are no real ones, then what are the expedient ones responding to?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a12_3']	開善解無實行聲聞，引《勝鬘》「三乘初業不愚於法」，外凡已知一乘，寧有二乘猶執小果？	開善解無實行聲聞，引《勝鬘》「三乘初業不愚於法」，外凡已知一乘，寧有二乘猶執小果？	04a	Kaishan explains that there are no actually practicing shravakas. Quoting the Shoulengyan Sutra, The beginners of the three vehicles are not ignorant of the Dharma, those in the outer stage of faith already know the One Vehicle. How could there be two vehicles still grasping at the small fruits?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a13_2']	經明有者權也，此二家偏執，乖經失義；	經明有者權也，此二家偏執，乖經失義；	04a	The sutra clarifies that there are expedient ones. These two schools are biased and go against the sutra and lose the meaning;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a14_3']	若定有者，經那言無聲聞弟子但化諸菩薩？	若定有者，經那言無聲聞弟子但化諸菩薩？	04a	If they definitely exist, why did the sūtra say that the Buddha had no śrāvaka disciples, but only transformed bodhisattvas?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a14_13']	若定無者，誰入化城？	若定無者，誰入化城？	04a	If they definitely do not exist, who entered the provisional city?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a15_4']	亦無三可會，權何所引？	亦無三可會，權何所引？	04a	There are also no three to be unified, so what provisional [teachings] would be drawn upon?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a16_13']	若言實有為權所引者，亦應實有三藏佛，復為權三藏佛所引；	若言實有為權所引者，亦應實有三藏佛，復為權三藏佛所引；	04a	If it is said that the real exists and is drawn upon by the provisional, then there should also be a real Tripiṭaka Buddha, who is drawn upon by the provisional Tripiṭaka Buddha;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a18_5']	若實無此佛，但有權佛者，何意不許但有權聲聞、無實聲聞耶？	若實無此佛，但有權佛者，何意不許但有權聲聞、無實聲聞耶？	04a	If there is no real Buddha, but only a provisional Buddha, why not allow that there are only provisional śrāvakas and no real śrāvakas?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a19_12']	此義不例，實有斷界內惑者，呼此為實，而權者應之。	此義不例，實有斷界內惑者，呼此為實，而權者應之。	04a	This meaning is not the same. There are those who truly sever the afflictions within the [three] realms, and they are called real, while the provisional [teachings] correspond to them.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a20_10']	何處有斷界內惑佛，而有權佛應此佛？	何處有斷界內惑佛，而有權佛應此佛？	04a	Where are there Buddhas who sever the afflictions within the [three] realms, and provisional Buddhas who correspond to these Buddhas?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a22_10']	今明有無不可偏執，若從長者實智往觀則無客作人，若就窮子根性則便自謂作人。	今明有無不可偏執，若從長者實智往觀則無客作人，若就窮子根性則便自謂作人。	04a	Now, it is explained that existence and non-existence cannot be grasped one-sidedly. If one observes from the real wisdom of the elder, then there are no hired workers. If one considers the disposition of the poor son, then he himself thinks he is a hired worker.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a23_1']	《法華論》有四種聲聞：	《法華論》有四種聲聞：	04a	The Fahua lun has four kinds of śrāvakas:

['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a23_16']	三、退大；	三、退大；	04a	Third, those who have regressed from the Great Vehicle;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a23_21']	四、應化。	四、應化。	04a	Fourth, those who are manifestations.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a24_10']	前二未熟不與授記，後二與記。	前二未熟不與授記，後二與記。	04a	The first two have not yet matured and are not given predictions, while the latter two are given predictions.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a25_1']	若依今經應有五：	若依今經應有五：	04a	If based on the present sutra, there should be five:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046a26_8']	一、久習小，今世道熟，聞小教證果，如《論》是決定聲聞；	一、久習小，今世道熟，聞小教證果，如《論》是決定聲聞；	04a	First, those who have long practiced the Lesser Vehicle and in this life have matured their path, hearing the Lesser Vehicle teachings and realizing the fruits, as in the treatise, are definitely śrāvakas;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b01_9']	二、本是菩薩積劫修道，中間疲厭生死，退大取小，《大品》稱為別異善根，佛且成其小道為說小教，齊教斷結取果，是退大未久習小來近，理應易悟，如《論》是退菩提聲聞；	二、本是菩薩積劫修道，中間疲厭生死，退大取小，《大品》稱為別異善根，佛且成其小道為說小教，齊教斷結取果，是退大未久習小來近，理應易悟，如《論》是退菩提聲聞；	04a	Second, those who were originally bodhisattvas cultivating the path for many eons, in the middle becoming weary of birth and death, regressing from the Great Vehicle and grasping the Lesser Vehicle. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra refers to them as having different wholesome roots. The Buddha temporarily establishes their Lesser Vehicle and teaches them the Lesser Vehicle teachings. They sever their bonds according to the teachings and realize the fruits. They have not regressed from the Great Vehicle for long and have recently practiced the Lesser Vehicle. Reason dictates that they should be easily enlightened, as in the treatise, they are śrāvakas who have regressed from bodhi;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b03_2']	三、以此二故，諸佛、菩薩內祕外現，成就引接令入大道，如《論》是應化聲聞；	三、以此二故，諸佛、菩薩內祕外現，成就引接令入大道，如《論》是應化聲聞；	04a	Third, because of these two, the buddhas and bodhisattvas secretly manifest externally, accomplishing the guidance and reception of those who enter the Great Way, as in the treatise, they are śrāvakas who are manifestations;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b06_11']	四、若見權實兩種能出生死，欣樂涅槃，修戒定慧，微有觀慧未入似位薄有所得，謂是證果，此名未得謂得、未證謂證，如《論》即是增上慢聲聞；	四、若見權實兩種能出生死，欣樂涅槃，修戒定慧，微有觀慧未入似位薄有所得，謂是證果，此名未得謂得、未證謂證，如《論》即是增上慢聲聞；	04a	Fourth, if one sees both provisional and real as able to escape from birth and death, delights in nirvana, cultivates precepts, concentration, and wisdom, has slight insight and has not yet entered the stage of resemblance, considers it to be the fruition of realization, this is called claiming attainment where there is none, claiming realization where there is none, as in the treatise, it is the śrāvaka of overweening pride;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b09_3']	五者、大乘聲聞，以佛道聲令一切聞，若從決定退菩提兩種，即有聲聞，若從大乘理無灰斷永住化城，終歸寶所。	五者、大乘聲聞，以佛道聲令一切聞，若從決定退菩提兩種，即有聲聞，若從大乘理無灰斷永住化城，終歸寶所。	04a	Fifth, the Mahāyāna śrāvaka, causing all to hear the sound of the Buddha's path. If one regresses from certainty and from bodhi, there are two kinds of śrāvakas. If one regresses from the principle of the Mahāyāna, there is no extinction, eternally dwelling in the city of the parinirvāṇa of the śrāvakas, ultimately returning to the treasure site of the Mahāyāna.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b09_18']	實者既爾，則無有權，故無聲聞。	實者既爾，則無有權，故無聲聞。	04a	Since the real is like this, there is no provisional, therefore there are no śrāvakas.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b11_2']	若增上慢者，既未入位則非實，又非應化，則非權。	若增上慢者，既未入位則非實，又非應化，則非權。	04a	If one of overweening pride has not yet entered the stage, then it is not real, and also not a manifestation, then it is not provisional.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b11_17']	若得此意，有無冷然，何須苦諍？	若得此意，有無冷然，何須苦諍？	04a	If one understands this meaning, existence and non-existence are clear, why must one argue bitterly?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b13_15']	復次秪就大乘聲聞復論有無，若權作應化，外現小迹內隱大德，則謂無大乘聲聞；	復次秪就大乘聲聞復論有無，若權作應化，外現小迹內隱大德，則謂無大乘聲聞；	04a	Next, within the Mahayana, there is also discussion of the existence or non-existence of the Sravakas. If they are temporarily made into manifestations, externally displaying small traces while internally concealing great virtues, then it is said that there are no Mahayana Sravakas;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b14_14']	若從自行發迹顯本，則言有大乘聲聞。	若從自行發迹顯本，則言有大乘聲聞。	04a	If they are based on their own practice, revealing their original nature, then it is said that there are Mahayana Sravakas.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b17_3']	今開三顯一正意，為決定退大聲聞令成大乘聲聞，自行既立即能化應聲聞，若得此意則達有無也。	今開三顯一正意，為決定退大聲聞令成大乘聲聞，自行既立即能化應聲聞，若得此意則達有無也。	04a	The main point of revealing the One Vehicle and abandoning the Three is to enable the Sravakas who have definitely regressed from the Mahayana to become Mahayana Sravakas. Once their own practice is established, they can then manifest as Sravakas. If one understands this meaning, then one will understand the existence or non-existence.

They are deluded by the one principle of non-arising, thinking that if the teachings are three, how can the principle be one?

['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b23_6']	以教惑理，此有失義。	以教惑理，此有失義。	04a	If teaching confuses principle, this has the meaning of loss.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b24_5']	上根以理惑教情多，初聞法說順情即悟；	上根以理惑教情多，初聞法說順情即悟；	04a	The superior capacity is more inclined to be confused by principle and teaching, and upon first hearing the doctrinal explanation that accords with their inclinations, they are immediately enlightened;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b25_12']	下根以教惑理情多，聞法說無三，逆其計謂故三聞乃解；	下根以教惑理情多，聞法說無三，逆其計謂故三聞乃解；	04a	The inferior capacity is more inclined to be confused by teaching and principle, and upon hearing the doctrinal explanation of the non-existence of the three, they go against their calculations and think it is still three, and only understand upon hearing it again;

['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0046b28_17']	若迴遑小乘理教則疑惑未盡，尚非初果斷結之人；	若迴遑小乘理教則疑惑未盡，尚非初果斷結之人；	04a	If they are wandering between the principle and teaching of the Lesser Vehicle, then their doubts have not yet been exhausted, and they are still not people of the first fruit who have severed bonds;

Now, this sūtra opens the path to return to the great vehicle, and they themselves fear that their understanding is mistaken, so they explain their understanding in the presence of the Buddha. The bodhisattvas are not like this, so there is no understanding.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047b17_3']	又其意有三：	又其意有三：	04a	Moreover, there are three meanings to this:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047b19_14']	一、菩薩本意求佛，設有異執而執輕終歸取佛，無有不得之慮，今聞三周之說，但是正其觀慧，故不須領解。	一、菩薩本意求佛，設有異執而執輕終歸取佛，無有不得之慮，今聞三周之說，但是正其觀慧，故不須領解。	04a	First, the original intention of the bodhisattvas was to seek Buddhahood. Even if they had different attachments, their attachments were light and they would eventually return to attain Buddhahood. There was no worry of not being able to attain it. Now, hearing the teachings of the three periods, it was merely to rectify their insight and wisdom, so there was no need for them to express their understanding.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047b21_19']	二、菩薩悟大，處處有文，二乘作佛始自今教，逐要流傳，故略菩薩領解，胡文或有，漢略不書耳。	二、菩薩悟大，處處有文，二乘作佛始自今教，逐要流傳，故略菩薩領解，胡文或有，漢略不書耳。	04a	Second, the bodhisattvas' realization of the great [vehicle] is found in many places in the scriptures. The teaching that the two vehicles become Buddhas began with this teaching. Following the essentials, it is transmitted, so the bodhisattvas' expression of understanding is omitted. The Sanskrit text may have it, but it was omitted in the Chinese translation.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047b25_2']	三、菩薩位行深絕，諸新小菩薩不敢領解，說〈壽量〉竟，彌勒總都領解，初從無生法忍，終訖餘有一生在，則是具足領解，更求何物云云？	三、菩薩位行深絕，諸新小菩薩不敢領解，說〈壽量〉竟，彌勒總都領解，初從無生法忍，終訖餘有一生在，則是具足領解，更求何物云云？	04a	Third, the bodhisattvas' stages and practices are profound and absolute. The new and small bodhisattvas did not dare to express their understanding. After the explanation of the [Lotus] Sutra's lifespan [chapter], Maitreya comprehensively expressed their understanding. Beginning from the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, ending with having only one life remaining, this is the complete expression of understanding. What else is there to seek?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047b26_13']	七、得記不得記者，若同皆領解，何故聲聞得記，不見緣覺、菩薩受記？	七、得記不得記者，若同皆領解，何故聲聞得記，不見緣覺、菩薩受記？	04a	Seventh, as for those who receive the prediction and those who do not, if they are the same in expressing their understanding, why do the śrāvakas receive the prediction, but do not see the pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas receiving the prediction?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047b26_18']	此亦三意：	此亦三意：	04a	This also has three meanings:

['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047b28_16']	今既悟大，欣斯別決，故為記劫國也。	今既悟大，欣斯別決，故為記劫國也。	04a	Now that they have realized the great, they rejoice in this separate determination, so they are given predictions about their eons and lands.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c02_6']	菩薩發心求佛行成自滿，故不欣急求佛亦不促授，又前教處處授菩薩記，此是恒說逐要傳譯如前云云。	菩薩發心求佛行成自滿，故不欣急求佛亦不促授，又前教處處授菩薩記，此是恒說逐要傳譯如前云云。	04a	Bodhisattvas give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment and seek to perfect the practice of the Buddha, so they do not rejoice in urgently seeking the Buddha, nor are they hastily given [the prediction]. Moreover, in the previous teachings, predictions were given here and there to bodhisattvas. This is the constant teaching that follows the essentials and is translated as before, and so on.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c03_4']	二、菩薩亦有別記，調達、龍女豈非記耶？	二、菩薩亦有別記，調達、龍女豈非記耶？	04a	Second, bodhisattvas also have separate predictions. Are Devadatta and the dragon girl not examples of predictions?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c03_12']	又〈法師品〉云：	又〈法師品〉云：	04a	Moreover, the Chapter on Dharma Teachers says:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c05_15']	「求聲聞者、求辟支佛者、求佛道者，如是等類，咸於佛前聞法華經，我皆與授記，當得三菩提。	「求聲聞者、求辟支佛者、求佛道者，如是等類，咸於佛前聞法華經，我皆與授記，當得三菩提。	04a	Those who seek to be śrāvakas, those who seek to be pratyekabuddhas, those who seek the Buddha way, such kinds all hear the Lotus Sutra in front of the Buddha, and I all give them predictions that they will attain the three kinds of enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c06_3']	」此豈非皆記耶？	」此豈非皆記耶？	04a	How could this not be all predictions?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c07_3']	三、二乘昔來未曾得八相記，故記其劫國；	三、二乘昔來未曾得八相記，故記其劫國；	04a	Third, those of the two vehicles have never received predictions about the eight stages in the past, so they are predicted about their eons and lands;
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c07_16']	菩薩先已曾記，故不重明耳。	菩薩先已曾記，故不重明耳。	04a	The bodhisattvas have already been predicted before, so it is not mentioned again.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c09_7']	淺近之記初住已得，非菩薩所欣，菩薩所欣乃是圓極妙覺遠記耳。	淺近之記初住已得，非菩薩所欣，菩薩所欣乃是圓極妙覺遠記耳。	04a	The shallow predictions can be attained by the initial stage of abiding, which is not what the bodhisattvas delight in. What the bodhisattvas delight in is precisely the distant prediction of the perfect and sublime enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c11_8']	故〈壽量品〉中，始從發心訖一生得，妙因斯滿、極果頓圓，此乃授法身記莂，何謂無記耶？	故〈壽量品〉中，始從發心訖一生得，妙因斯滿、極果頓圓，此乃授法身記莂，何謂無記耶？	04a	Therefore, in the chapter on the Buddha's life span, from the initial arousal of the mind to attaining enlightenment in one life, the wonderful cause is fulfilled and the ultimate fruit is suddenly perfected. This is the bestowal of the prediction of the dharma body. How can it be said that there is no prediction?

['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c12_12']	答：	答：	04a	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c14_7']	八相是應記，既得應記知必有本，欲使物知聞共結來緣，故與應記耳。	八相是應記，既得應記知必有本，欲使物知聞共結來緣，故與應記耳。	04a	The eight stages of spiritual development are the prediction of the response. Since one has attained the prediction of the response, one knows that there must be the fundamental. One wishes to make others know and hear, and thus form the connection for the future. Therefore, one is only given the prediction of the response.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c15_7']	又此二乘若聞〈壽量〉，即同損生得法身記也。	又此二乘若聞〈壽量〉，即同損生得法身記也。	04a	Moreover, if these two vehicles hear the chapter on the Buddha's life span, they will be the same as those who eliminate birth and receive the prediction of the dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c16_15']	八、明悟有淺深者，一往同破無明入證初住，細尋必應明晦。	八、明悟有淺深者，一往同破無明入證初住，細尋必應明晦。	04a	The eighth, clarifying that there are shallow and profound understandings, is generally the same as breaking through ignorance and entering the initial stage of abiding. If one carefully examines it, there must be clarity and obscurity.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c17_15']	初聞法說尚入佛慧，更聞譬說豈不重明？	初聞法說尚入佛慧，更聞譬說豈不重明？	04a	Initially hearing the doctrinal explanation, they still entered the Buddha's wisdom. Hearing the parables again, how could it not further clarify?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c19_16']	又聞因緣，理自增進，更聞〈壽量〉彌復優深，如聽法人重聞勝前，單複厚薄方之可知也。	又聞因緣，理自增進，更聞〈壽量〉彌復優深，如聽法人重聞勝前，單複厚薄方之可知也。	04a	Moreover, hearing the causes and conditions, the principle naturally increases. Hearing the Lifespan chapter again, it becomes even more profound. It is like a listener who hears it again and again, surpassing the previous. The thickness of single and multiple [hearings] can be known by comparing.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c21_9']	九、明權實得益不同者，一云實行得益，權行正為接引影響不論其益。	九、明權實得益不同者，一云實行得益，權行正為接引影響不論其益。	04a	9. Clarifying the difference in the benefits obtained by the provisional and the real: One says that those of real practice obtain benefits, while those of provisional practice are mainly to be guided and influenced, and their benefits are not discussed.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c23_14']	今明不爾，若至〈壽量〉權實悉得益，增道彌高、損生彌盡，隣圓際極，唯一生在，豈非權者益耶？	今明不爾，若至〈壽量〉權實悉得益，增道彌高、損生彌盡，隣圓際極，唯一生在，豈非權者益耶？	04a	Now it is clarified that this is not so. If one reaches the Lifespan chapter, both the provisional and the real obtain benefits, increasing the path and becoming higher, reducing birth and becoming more exhausted. Neighboring the ultimate of perfection, there is only one life left. Isn't this a benefit for those of the provisional?
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c24_18']	所以初為影響共熟實行，後說極果則自道明，文云：	所以初為影響共熟實行，後說極果則自道明，文云：	04a	Therefore, initially for the sake of the guiding and influencing, together ripening those of real practice, later expounding the ultimate fruit then the path becomes clear by itself. The text says:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c28_7']	「出入息利乃遍他國」，息利在他即是己利，實行得益由於權引，化功歸己權亦得益，故一音演說法，眾生隨類各得解，何必須待〈壽量〉耶云云？	「出入息利乃遍他國」，息利在他即是己利，實行得益由於權引，化功歸己權亦得益，故一音演說法，眾生隨類各得解，何必須待〈壽量〉耶云云？	04a	The profits from lending money go all the way to other countries - the profits from lending money in other places are one's own profits. The actual practice of gaining benefits comes from the guidance of skillful means. The merit of transformation returns to oneself, and the skillful means also gain benefits. Therefore, when the Buddha expounds the Dharma with one voice, sentient beings understand it according to their own kind. Why must we wait for the chapter on lifespan? And so on.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0047c29_3']	又我自欲得此真淨大法即是自益也。	又我自欲得此真淨大法即是自益也。	04a	Moreover, if I myself wish to obtain this true and pure great Dharma, this is benefiting oneself.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0048a01_11']	十、明待時不待時，爾前不悟必待《法華》悟者，名為待時；	十、明待時不待時，爾前不悟必待《法華》悟者，名為待時；	04a	Ten, clarifying whether or not one waits for the right time. Those who do not realize the truth before the Lotus Sutra and must wait for the Lotus Sutra to realize it are called waiting for the right time.

['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0048a04_8']	佛有顯密二說，若顯說為論，《法華》之前二乘未悟大道，要須五味調熟會在法華，故云：	佛有顯密二說，若顯說為論，《法華》之前二乘未悟大道，要須五味調熟會在法華，故云：	04a	The Buddha has two kinds of teachings, explicit and implicit. If we discuss the explicit teachings, before the Lotus Sutra, the two vehicles had not yet realized the great way. They must be ripened and matured through the five flavors and gather in the Lotus Sutra. Therefore it is said:
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0048a05_7']	「說時未至故，今正是其時，決定說大乘。	「說時未至故，今正是其時，決定說大乘。	04a	Because the time for speaking has not yet come, now is the right time, and I will definitely speak the great vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0048a07_14']	若密教為論，未必具待五味在法華方會，爾前密有入者故名不待時，此乃大判時不時。	若密教為論，未必具待五味在法華方會，爾前密有入者故名不待時，此乃大判時不時。	04a	If we discuss the secret teaching, it is not necessarily necessary to wait for the five flavors to be gathered in the Lotus Sutra. There are those who secretly enter before that, so it is called not waiting for the time. This is the general classification of timely and untimely.
['ZH_T34_1718_04a:0048a09_14']	若就三周，亦是待時、不待時，迹本二門，亦是待時、不待時，致有前後悟入，即此意也。	若就三周，亦是待時、不待時，迹本二門，亦是待時、不待時，致有前後悟入，即此意也。	04a	If we discuss the three periods, it is also waiting for the time and not waiting for the time. The two gates of traces and origin are also waiting for the time and not waiting for the time. There are those who realize and enter before and after. This is the meaning.

Therefore, there is no missing the time. It is simply waiting for the time in that land.
