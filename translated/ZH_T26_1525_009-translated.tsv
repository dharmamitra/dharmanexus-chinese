['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269b24_3']	「初託胎識行為因緣，以彼能作種子義故；	「初託胎識行為因緣，以彼能作種子義故；	009	The consciousness at the initial conception is the causal condition, because it can function as the meaning of seeds;
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269b26_1']	已種種子名色為因緣，以能和合成就事故，以二因緣住持成就依止，能取境界觀故。	已種種子名色為因緣，以能和合成就事故，以二因緣住持成就依止，能取境界觀故。	009	The name-and-form that has already planted the seeds is the causal condition, because it can accomplish things through combination, and the two causal conditions can accomplish the support that can grasp and observe objects.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269b29_2']	又行因緣而業得名，是故經中說諸業因為能生因，名色因緣而愛得名，是故經中說彼愛緣為能生緣，以二因緣於境界中依境界住。	又行因緣而業得名，是故經中說諸業因為能生因，名色因緣而愛得名，是故經中說彼愛緣為能生緣，以二因緣於境界中依境界住。	009	Moreover, the causal condition of karmic activity is called karma, therefore the sūtra says that the causal condition of karmic activity is the productive cause. The causal condition of name-and-form is called craving, therefore the sūtra says that the causal condition of craving is the productive condition. The two causal conditions rely on objects and abide in objects.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c01_11']	又行因緣初生心得名，名色因緣已生，六入未成就六入得名。	又行因緣初生心得名，名色因緣已生，六入未成就六入得名。	009	Moreover, the causal condition of karmic activity is called the initial arising of the mind, and the causal condition of name-and-form is called the already arisen six sense bases that have not yet accomplished the six sense bases.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c02_1']	又行因緣依一門行。	又行因緣依一門行。	009	Moreover, the causal conditions of activity are practiced through one door.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c02_6']	此以何義？	此以何義？	009	What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c03_5']	彼行因緣唯意門行，名色因緣依二門行。	彼行因緣唯意門行，名色因緣依二門行。	009	The causal conditions of name and form are practiced through two doors.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c03_10']	此以何義？	此以何義？	009	What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c04_13']	名色依於身根意根二門而行，以二因緣依六門行。	名色依於身根意根二門而行，以二因緣依六門行。	009	Name and form are practiced through two doors, the body faculty and the mind faculty. The causal conditions of the six sense bases are practiced through six doors.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c07_1']	又行因緣唯惡道中以依罪業能攝住故，如經中說，彼諸眾生於惡道中乃至惡業未盡不死，業盡乃死。	又行因緣唯惡道中以依罪業能攝住故，如經中說，彼諸眾生於惡道中乃至惡業未盡不死，業盡乃死。	009	Moreover, the causal conditions of activity are only practiced in the evil destinies, because they are able to gather and abide through evil karma. As it is said in the sūtras, Those beings in the evil destinies do not die until their evil karma is exhausted, and they die only when the karma is exhausted.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c08_16']	如是等名色因緣，人及天道欲色界中，以彼處有名色二事，無色界中無二因緣。	如是等名色因緣，人及天道欲色界中，以彼處有名色二事，無色界中無二因緣。	009	In this way, the causal conditions of name and form are in the human and heavenly paths, the desire realm and form realm, because those places have the two things of name and form. In the formless realm, there are no two causal conditions.

['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c11_8']	何故於此修多羅中而說依識因緣名色？	何故於此修多羅中而說依識因緣名色？	009	Why is it said in this sūtra that name-and-form is conditioned by consciousness?
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c11_12']	」答曰：	」答曰：	009	The answer is:

['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c13_20']	如依所依是故有依。	如依所依是故有依。	009	This is because there is dependence based on the dependent.

['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c15_7']	如王及臣迭共相依而王為勝，以王去時臣亦隨去。	如王及臣迭共相依而王為勝，以王去時臣亦隨去。	009	Just as the king and his ministers mutually depend on each other, but the king is superior, because when the king leaves, the ministers also follow.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c16_16']	此亦如是，識與名色迭共相依，而識為勝，是故依識而有名色。	此亦如是，識與名色迭共相依，而識為勝，是故依識而有名色。	009	It is the same here. Consciousness and name-and-form mutually depend on each other, but consciousness is superior. Therefore, based on consciousness, there is name-and-form.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c17_14']	若識因緣不託母胎，諸心數法則不得有。	若識因緣不託母胎，諸心數法則不得有。	009	If the condition of consciousness does not rely on the mother's womb, the mental factors will not exist.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c18_8']	以識託胎，諸心數法皆亦隨從。	以識託胎，諸心數法皆亦隨從。	009	Because consciousness relies on the womb, all the mental factors also follow.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c19_17']	又因根本心成歌羅邏，以赤白等和合則能成歌羅邏，為成眾生。	又因根本心成歌羅邏，以赤白等和合則能成歌羅邏，為成眾生。	009	Moreover, based on the fundamental mind, the kalala is formed. Because the combination of blood and semen can form the kalala, it becomes the formation of sentient beings.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c21_2']	彼處識心為根本因，如大因緣法門中說，佛告阿難：	彼處識心為根本因，如大因緣法門中說，佛告阿難：	009	The consciousness mind is the fundamental cause there, as explained in the Dharma gate of the great causes and conditions. The Buddha told Ānanda:
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c22_5']	『若彼識心不託母胎，彼歌羅邏及名色等亦不成就。	『若彼識心不託母胎，彼歌羅邏及名色等亦不成就。	009	If that consciousness mind does not rely on the mother's womb, then the kalala and name-and-form will also not be accomplished.
['ZH_T26_1525_009:0269c24_3']	』是故識為諸苦種子，為欲示現根本義故，是故唯說識緣名色，不說名色因緣於識。	』是故識為諸苦種子，為欲示現根本義故，是故唯說識緣名色，不說名色因緣於識。	009	Therefore, consciousness is the seed of all suffering. In order to show the meaning of the fundamental, therefore it only says that consciousness conditions name-and-form, and does not say that name-and-form conditions consciousness.
