['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c16_9']	如經說：	如經說：	008	As it is said in the sūtra:
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c19_2']	菩薩地中諸菩薩所受禁戒，若略說有四種勝相故，名勝相應知，謂差別勝相、共不共學處勝相、曠大勝相、甚深勝相。	菩薩地中諸菩薩所受禁戒，若略說有四種勝相故，名勝相應知，謂差別勝相、共不共學處勝相、曠大勝相、甚深勝相。	008	In the Bodhisattva Grounds, the precepts that all bodhisattvas receive have four kinds of superior characteristics in brief, and are therefore called superior characteristics. They should be known as the superior characteristics of distinctions, the superior characteristics of the common and uncommon precepts, the superior characteristics of vastness, and the superior characteristics of profundity.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c20_8']	此中差別勝相者，謂守護戒、攝善法戒、利益眾生戒故。	此中差別勝相者，謂守護戒、攝善法戒、利益眾生戒故。	008	Among them, the superior characteristics of distinctions refer to the precepts of guarding, the precepts of embracing wholesome dharmas, and the precepts of benefiting sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c21_3']	於中守護戒是餘二戒住處應知；	於中守護戒是餘二戒住處應知；	008	Among them, the precepts of guarding are the abode of the other two precepts. It should be known that;
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c21_15']	攝善法戒是出生佛法住處；	攝善法戒是出生佛法住處；	008	The precepts of embracing wholesome dharmas are the abode of the arising of the Buddha Dharma;
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c22_11']	利益眾生戒是成熟眾生住處應知。	利益眾生戒是成熟眾生住處應知。	008	The precept of benefiting sentient beings is the abode of maturing sentient beings, which should be known.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c23_9']	共學者，聲聞及菩薩等，性罪不行故。	共學者，聲聞及菩薩等，性罪不行故。	008	The common training refers to the non-performance of natural offenses by śrāvakas and bodhisattvas, etc.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c24_1']	不共學者，謂遮罪不行故。	不共學者，謂遮罪不行故。	008	The uncommon training refers to the non-performance of prohibited offenses.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c25_10']	此學處或於聲聞是犯、菩薩非犯，或有於菩薩是犯、聲聞非犯。	此學處或於聲聞是犯、菩薩非犯，或有於菩薩是犯、聲聞非犯。	008	This training may be an offense for a śrāvaka but not for a bodhisattva, or there may be an offense for a bodhisattva but not for a śrāvaka.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c27_4']	菩薩學處謂身口意，聲聞學處謂唯身口，是故菩薩心亦是犯，非餘聲聞等。	菩薩學處謂身口意，聲聞學處謂唯身口，是故菩薩心亦是犯，非餘聲聞等。	008	The bodhisattva's training refers to body, speech, and mind, while the śrāvaka's training refers only to body and speech. Therefore, for the bodhisattva, the mind is also an offense, but not for other śrāvakas, etc.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0304c29_11']	略說但是攝受一切眾生無罪過身口意業，菩薩一切所應行者，於彼皆應學之，即是共不共學處應知。	略說但是攝受一切眾生無罪過身口意業，菩薩一切所應行者，於彼皆應學之，即是共不共學處應知。	008	In brief, all the bodily, verbal, and mental actions of bodhisattvas that are free from fault and benefit all sentient beings are what bodhisattvas should practice. One should learn them all, which are the common and uncommon trainings that should be known.

['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a01_9']	云何得知菩薩學處與聲聞差別？	云何得知菩薩學處與聲聞差別？	008	How can one know the difference between the bodhisattva's training and that of the śrāvakas?
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a03_2']	言品類差別者，由聲聞等唯有一守護戒，無攝善法戒及利益眾生戒。	言品類差別者，由聲聞等唯有一守護戒，無攝善法戒及利益眾生戒。	008	As for the distinctions in categories, it is because śrāvakas and others only have one kind of precept guarding, which is the precept guarding of not harming others, and do not have the precept of accumulating good dharmas or the precept of benefiting sentient beings.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a04_3']	共不共學處戒者，於中性罪，謂殺生等是為共。	共不共學處戒者，於中性罪，謂殺生等是為共。	008	As for the precepts that are shared and not shared, among them, natural offenses such as killing are shared.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a04_15']	掘地斷草等制罪，是不共。	掘地斷草等制罪，是不共。	008	Offenses established by prohibitions such as digging the ground or cutting grass are not shared.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a06_15']	此後學處，於聲聞有罪、菩薩無罪，如聲聞於夏中行是犯，菩薩見有眾生利益事不去是犯。	此後學處，於聲聞有罪、菩薩無罪，如聲聞於夏中行是犯，菩薩見有眾生利益事不去是犯。	008	These latter precepts are offenses for śrāvakas but not offenses for bodhisattvas. For example, for śrāvakas to travel during the rainy season is an offense, but for bodhisattvas to not go when there is a matter of benefiting sentient beings is an offense.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a08_18']	攝受一切眾生無罪過者，攝一切眾生而無罪過，非如以女色等與之，雖是攝受然非無罪過業。	攝受一切眾生無罪過者，攝一切眾生而無罪過，非如以女色等與之，雖是攝受然非無罪過業。	008	As for embracing all sentient beings without fault, it means embracing all sentient beings without fault, unlike using one's own female form and so on to embrace them, which although is a form of embracing, is not without faulty karma.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a09_14']	為離此過，故應說以無罪過攝故。	為離此過，故應說以無罪過攝故。	008	In order to avoid this fault, one should speak of embracing without fault.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a11_1']	心亦是犯者，如害覺等，但起覺時即是菩薩罪，非聲聞故。	心亦是犯者，如害覺等，但起覺時即是菩薩罪，非聲聞故。	008	As for the mind is also an offense, it means that when one gives rise to thoughts such as thoughts of harming, at that very moment it is an offense for a bodhisattva, but not for a śrāvaka.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a12_6']	此增上戒等三學，即是波羅蜜體性，何故復更建立三學？	此增上戒等三學，即是波羅蜜體性，何故復更建立三學？	008	These three trainings of superior morality, etc. are precisely the essence of the perfections. Why are the three trainings established again?
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a13_1']	此與波羅蜜差別義，今當顯示。	此與波羅蜜差別義，今當顯示。	008	The meaning of the distinction between this and the perfections will now be revealed.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a14_7']	由展轉相因故，別立諸學處，依戒故生定，依定故生慧。	由展轉相因故，別立諸學處，依戒故生定，依定故生慧。	008	Because they mutually cause each other, the various training precepts are established separately. Concentration arises based on morality, and wisdom arises based on concentration.

['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a18_4']	曠大差別者，復有四種曠大故，一種種無量學曠大、二攝無量福德曠大、三攝一切眾生利樂心曠大、四阿耨多羅三藐三菩提住處曠大。	曠大差別者，復有四種曠大故，一種種無量學曠大、二攝無量福德曠大、三攝一切眾生利樂心曠大、四阿耨多羅三藐三菩提住處曠大。	008	As for the distinction of vastness, there are four kinds of vastness: vastness of various immeasurable trainings, vastness of encompassing immeasurable merit, vastness of the mind of benefiting and delighting all sentient beings, and vastness of being the abode of supreme perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a18_7', 'ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a20_5']	釋曰：🔽種種無量學處曠大者，諸菩薩學處亦種種亦無量，以於眾生行教化及作攝事故。	釋曰： 種種無量學處曠大者，諸菩薩學處亦種種亦無量，以於眾生行教化及作攝事故。	008	The commentary says:🔽As for the vastness of various immeasurable training precepts, the training precepts of bodhisattvas are also various and immeasurable, because they transform and guide sentient beings and engage in benefiting and delighting them.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a21_12']	攝無量福德者，由攝諸菩薩福德資糧不可測量，聲聞不爾。	攝無量福德者，由攝諸菩薩福德資糧不可測量，聲聞不爾。	008	As for encompassing immeasurable merit, it is because the accumulation of merit of bodhisattvas is immeasurable, unlike that of śrāvakas.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a23_2']	攝一切眾生利樂意者，於中勸令修善是利益意，此人以此善故。	攝一切眾生利樂意者，於中勸令修善是利益意，此人以此善故。	008	The intention to benefit and bring happiness to all sentient beings means encouraging them to cultivate goodness, and this person, because of this goodness,
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a23_17']	若於果時當得福報，此名安樂意。	若於果時當得福報，此名安樂意。	008	will obtain the rewards of blessings and virtues in the future, which is called the intention to bring happiness.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a25_15']	阿耨多羅三藐三菩提住處曠大者，阿耨多羅三藐三菩提住此戒而得，聲聞戒不爾。	阿耨多羅三藐三菩提住處曠大者，阿耨多羅三藐三菩提住此戒而得，聲聞戒不爾。	008	The abode of supreme perfect enlightenment is vast, because supreme perfect enlightenment is attained by abiding in this precept, not so for the precepts of the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a26_2']	論曰：	論曰：	008	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a28_13']	甚深差別者，若菩薩以如是等方便善巧行殺生等十種惡業，然不得罪，生無量福，疾證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	甚深差別者，若菩薩以如是等方便善巧行殺生等十種惡業，然不得罪，生無量福，疾證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	008	The distinction of profundity means that if a bodhisattva uses such skillful means to engage in the ten evil actions such as killing, he does not incur offenses but generates immeasurable blessings and quickly realizes supreme perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305a29_10']	又變化身口業，應知是菩薩甚深戒。	又變化身口業，應知是菩薩甚深戒。	008	Moreover, the bodily and verbal actions of transformation should be known as the profound precepts of the bodhisattva.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b01_16']	或為國王顯示種種逼惱眾生事，以此成立眾生於律行中。	或為國王顯示種種逼惱眾生事，以此成立眾生於律行中。	008	Sometimes as a king, he displays various ways of afflicting sentient beings, using this to establish sentient beings in the practice of the precepts.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b03_18']	又種種本生中示現故，顯示逼惱餘眾生，攝受餘眾生故，先令他心生淨信，然後教化成熟。	又種種本生中示現故，顯示逼惱餘眾生，攝受餘眾生故，先令他心生淨信，然後教化成熟。	008	Moreover, because it is shown in various past lives, it manifests afflicting other sentient beings and accepting other sentient beings. First, it causes the minds of others to give rise to pure faith, and then it teaches and transforms them to maturity.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b04_8']	此名菩薩戒甚深勝相。	此名菩薩戒甚深勝相。	008	This is called the profound and excellent characteristics of the bodhisattva precepts.

['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b10_6']	若如是知，此人以此不善，與無間地獄相應；	若如是知，此人以此不善，與無間地獄相應；	008	If one knows in this way, this person, with this unwholesomeness, corresponds with the uninterrupted hell;
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b12_9']	菩薩以知他心智知，更無餘別方便能轉其惡業，令不決定墮惡道，知決定作此業已必墮地獄。	菩薩以知他心智知，更無餘別方便能轉其惡業，令不決定墮惡道，知決定作此業已必墮地獄。	008	Bodhisattvas know through the knowledge of others' minds that there is no other expedient that can turn their evil karma and prevent them from falling into the evil destinies with certainty, knowing that having done this karma they will definitely fall into hell.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b12_19']	如是知已，即起此心：	如是知已，即起此心：	008	Knowing this, they immediately give rise to this thought:

['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b14_13']	殺之雖現世少受苦惱，未來當受安樂。	殺之雖現世少受苦惱，未來當受安樂。	008	Although killing brings a little suffering in the present world, in the future one will experience peace and happiness.
['ZH_T31_1596_008:0305b16_14']	是故猶如醫師，菩薩以利益心殺之無罪，得大勝福，由此福德故疾得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	是故猶如醫師，菩薩以利益心殺之無罪，得大勝福，由此福德故疾得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。	008	Therefore, just like a doctor, the bodhisattva kills with a mind of benefit, without sin, and gains great and excellent blessings. Because of this merit and virtue, one quickly attains supreme perfect enlightenment.
