['ZH_T30_1573_001:0253b26_1']	有所得人於此法中心取為體，此法於陰界入中有聲緣轉，如說一體二體多體，如彼此人一二眾多各有自體故名自體。	有所得人於此法中心取為體，此法於陰界入中有聲緣轉，如說一體二體多體，如彼此人一二眾多各有自體故名自體。	People who have attained something take this dharma as the essence in their minds. This dharma arises with sound as its condition within the aggregates, realms, and sense bases, as it is said to have one essence, two essences, or many essences. Just as this person, one person, two people, or many people each have their own essence, it is called essence.

Therefore, there is the non-existence of essence.
['ZH_T30_1573_001:0253c05_18']	自性無體，故言無體。	自性無體，故言無體。	The non-existence of self-nature is called the non-existence of essence.
['ZH_T30_1573_001:0253c07_2']	偈言自體性無體者，離無體更無別體，故言自體無體。	偈言自體性無體者，離無體更無別體，故言自體無體。	The verse says, The non-existence of self-nature means that apart from the non-existence of essence, there is no separate essence. Therefore, it is said that the self-nature is without essence.
