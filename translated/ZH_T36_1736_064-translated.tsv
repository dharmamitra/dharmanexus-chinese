Each takes the first one of the roots and what is produced to include the other one, so it omits the arrogance of the Dharma and the arrogance of proper acceptance.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0511a26_11']	故今答云：	故今答云：	064	Therefore, the answer now says:
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0511a27_10']	前所觀如，入觀則能，出觀隨有猶見染相。	前所觀如，入觀則能，出觀隨有猶見染相。	064	Previously, when contemplating suchness, one could enter contemplation but after emerging from contemplation, one still saw defiled appearances.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0511a29_10']	雖有三重救難，染淨之相皆存。	雖有三重救難，染淨之相皆存。	064	Although there were three rounds of refutations, the characteristics of defilement and purity still remained.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0511b02_18']	謂既染淨平等，則異前地十淨平等。	謂既染淨平等，則異前地十淨平等。	064	It means that since defilement and purity are equal, it is different from the ten equalities of purity in the previous stage.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0511b04_6']	二者染淨既等，不唯但能觀於淨如，則雙通二三之兩救也。	二者染淨既等，不唯但能觀於淨如，則雙通二三之兩救也。	064	Second, since defilement and purity are equal, one is not only able to contemplate pure suchness, which responds to both the second and third refutations.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512a25_17']	前中，通則初地明得。	前中，通則初地明得。	064	In the first, the general is that the initial ground clarifies attainment.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512a27_10']	謂初地得無我，亦得名空平等理，亦可名為無生無我，即是空無生故。	謂初地得無我，亦得名空平等理，亦可名為無生無我，即是空無生故。	064	It is said that the initial ground attains non-self, which can also be called the principle of emptiness and equality, or it can be called the emptiness of non-arising and non-self, which is the emptiness of non-arising.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512a29_3']	六地名空平等，亦可得名無生無我空平等理，即是無生空無我故。	六地名空平等，亦可得名無生無我空平等理，即是無生空無我故。	064	The sixth ground is called emptiness and equality, which can also be called the principle of emptiness and equality of non-arising and non-self, which is the emptiness of non-arising and non-self.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b05_5']	文中二：	文中二：	064	In the text, there are two parts:

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b08_9']	言「破性顯空」者，若人若法皆無性故空，此則義當信忍。	言「破性顯空」者，若人若法皆無性故空，此則義當信忍。	064	As for Destroying nature and revealing emptiness, because both persons and dharmas are without nature, they are empty. This then corresponds to the forbearance of faith.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b09_1']	舉初攝後，故云初地。	舉初攝後，故云初地。	064	Taking the first to include the later, it is called the first ground.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b10_8']	疏「今此地中破相趣寂名空平等」者，豈唯無性，相亦不存。	疏「今此地中破相趣寂名空平等」者，豈唯無性，相亦不存。	064	The commentary says, In this ground, destroying characteristics and heading towards quiescence is called the equality of emptiness. How could it only be without nature? Characteristics also do not exist.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b12_1']	故經文云「無相無體故平等」，非唯有相，空相亦遣，方為真空平等理也。	故經文云「無相無體故平等」，非唯有相，空相亦遣，方為真空平等理也。	064	Therefore, the sutra text says, Because there are no characteristics and no substance, they are equal. It is not only that there are no characteristics, even the characteristics of emptiness are eliminated, which is then the principle of the equality of true emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b12_16']	義當順忍，舉後攝前，義該四五。	義當順忍，舉後攝前，義該四五。	064	The meaning corresponds to the forbearance of accordance, taking the latter to include the former, the meaning encompassing the fourth and fifth [stages].
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b13_19']	疏「若約證實」下，當無生忍，舉初攝後，義該八九。	疏「若約證實」下，當無生忍，舉初攝後，義該八九。	064	The commentary below If it is about realizing the truth corresponds to the forbearance of non-arising, taking the first to include the latter, the meaning encompassing the eighth and ninth [stages].
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b16_8']	而言「證實反望」者，上之二義但破空性相故，今已證實，反望性相本來常寂，何俟破竟方說無我及空平等？	而言「證實反望」者，上之二義但破空性相故，今已證實，反望性相本來常寂，何俟破竟方說無我及空平等？	064	As for saying realizing the truth and looking back, the above two meanings only break down the nature and characteristics of emptiness, so now that the truth has been realized, looking back, the nature and characteristics have always been quiescent from the beginning. Why wait until the breaking down is finished to speak of the equality of no-self and emptiness?
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b17_16']	言「斯理轉深」者，則上空平等中亦合言斯義漸深，文略無耳。	言「斯理轉深」者，則上空平等中亦合言斯義漸深，文略無耳。	064	As for saying this principle turns deeper, then in the above equality of emptiness, it should also say this meaning gradually deepens, but the text is abbreviated and does not have it.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b19_6']	疏「若約契本常寂」下，即寂滅忍，舉初該後，云「十地後得」。	疏「若約契本常寂」下，即寂滅忍，舉初該後，云「十地後得」。	064	The commentary below If it is about conforming to the original constant quiescence is the forbearance of quiescent extinction, taking the first to include the latter, saying after the ten grounds.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b20_13']	而言契本常寂者，前無生忍證實，望相則前所破與所證未同。	而言契本常寂者，前無生忍證實，望相則前所破與所證未同。	064	As for saying conforming to the original constant quiescence, the previous forbearance of non-arising realizes the truth, but looking at characteristics, what was previously broken down is not yet the same as what was realized.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b21_14']	今寂滅忍契所破常寂即所證故，故云最妙。	今寂滅忍契所破常寂即所證故，故云最妙。	064	Now the forbearance of quiescent extinction conforms to the constant quiescence of what was broken down, which is precisely what was realized, so it is called the most wonderful.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b22_13']	疏「二就行分別」等者，此約生起名生。	疏「二就行分別」等者，此約生起名生。	064	The commentary's second, distinguishing based on practice and so forth - this is based on the arising called birth.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b23_3']	七地頓起，何名無生？	七地頓起，何名無生？	064	The seventh ground suddenly gives rise to [wisdom], why is it called birthless?
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b24_1']	以起行皆遍，無可新起，故云無生耳。	以起行皆遍，無可新起，故云無生耳。	064	Because the practices that are given rise to are all pervasive, there is nothing new to give rise to, thus it is called birthless.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b24_17']	疏「三約空有」者，亦是生起之生。	疏「三約空有」者，亦是生起之生。	064	The commentary's third, based on emptiness and existence - this is also the arising called birth.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b26_7']	不同前行，隨一行中有空有故，入觀起空、出觀起有故，間起名生。	不同前行，隨一行中有空有故，入觀起空、出觀起有故，間起名生。	064	Unlike the previous practices, within each practice there is emptiness and existence, because entering contemplation gives rise to emptiness, and leaving contemplation gives rise to existence, thus the occasional arising is called birth.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b27_14']	七地常在觀，而涉有不迷於空、觀空不礙於有，故稱方便。	七地常在觀，而涉有不迷於空、觀空不礙於有，故稱方便。	064	The seventh ground is always in contemplation, yet engaging with existence without being deluded about emptiness, and contemplating emptiness without obstructing existence, thus it is called skillful means.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b28_7']	更無出入之殊，故云無生。	更無出入之殊，故云無生。	064	There is no more distinction of entering and leaving, thus it is called birthless.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512b29_14']	生澁名生，純熟名不生。	生澁名生，純熟名不生。	064	Rough and raw is called birth, pure and ripe is called birthless.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c01_7']	七地猶有功用，故名生澁；	七地猶有功用，故名生澁；	064	The seventh ground still has effort, thus it is called rough and raw;
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c02_2']	八地無功任運而進，故云純熟。	八地無功任運而進，故云純熟。	064	The eighth ground is effortless and spontaneous, thus it is called pure and ripe.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c03_7']	疏「第二不住道行勝」等者，先總科、後「今初」下別釋。	疏「第二不住道行勝」等者，先總科、後「今初」下別釋。	064	The commentary's second, the supreme practice of abiding in the path and so on first gives a general outline, then below now, the first it gives a specific explanation.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c08_5']	疏「由前觀察隨順得至不住道」者，故論經云「是菩薩如是觀一切法隨順得至」，論釋云「得至不住道行勝故」。	疏「由前觀察隨順得至不住道」者，故論經云「是菩薩如是觀一切法隨順得至」，論釋云「得至不住道行勝故」。	064	The commentary's due to the previous observation and compliance, one attains the supreme practice of abiding in the path is why the sutra says the bodhisattva thus observes all dharmas and attains compliance, and the treatise explains attaining the supreme practice of abiding in the path.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c09_18']	今經略無隨順得至之言，而言如是觀已，意則合有，故疏取論攝前釋之。	今經略無隨順得至之言，而言如是觀已，意則合有，故疏取論攝前釋之。	064	The current sutra passage is abbreviated and lacks the words attains compliance and attains, but the meaning is combined, so the commentary takes the treatise to include the previous explanation.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c10_15']	疏「今初三中」下，且釋能觀三悲。	疏「今初三中」下，且釋能觀三悲。	064	The commentary's now, the first of the three and so on first explains the three compassions that are able to observe.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c13_10']	若無大悲即同二乘，今有故勝。	若無大悲即同二乘，今有故勝。	064	If there is no great compassion, it is the same as the two vehicles. Now, because there is [great compassion], it is superior.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c15_7']	然「一切智觀」者，即《大品經》以聲聞名一切智，菩薩名道種智，如來為一切種智。	然「一切智觀」者，即《大品經》以聲聞名一切智，菩薩名道種智，如來為一切種智。	064	Moreover, the observation of omniscience is the Sutra of the Great Perfection of Wisdom, which uses the name of the śrāvaka for omniscience, the bodhisattva for the knowledge of the path, and the Tathāgata for the knowledge of all aspects.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c16_5']	此則橫對大小因果，分此三別不同。	此則橫對大小因果，分此三別不同。	064	This then horizontally corresponds to the causes and effects of the small and great, and distinguishes these three differences.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c17_18']	謂佛為一切智觀三世流轉者，將下經意釋論「不捨過去現在未來」之言。	謂佛為一切智觀三世流轉者，將下經意釋論「不捨過去現在未來」之言。	064	It is said that the Buddha, for the observation of omniscience, contemplates the three periods of time as flowing and transforming, which will explain the meaning of the sutra below and explain the words of the commentary not abandoning the past, present, and future.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c19_2']	其「厭離有為」，即下論觀名，依大悲為首立此觀故。	其「厭離有為」，即下論觀名，依大悲為首立此觀故。	064	As for disgust with conditioned existence, this is the observation name below the commentary, because it establishes this observation based on great compassion as the foremost.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0512c19_15']	「而以大悲」下，正釋勝義。	「而以大悲」下，正釋勝義。	064	Below but with great compassion, it correctly explains the meaning of superiority.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a01_9']	大悲攝故，即是悲義。	大悲攝故，即是悲義。	064	because it is embraced by great compassion, it is the meaning of compassion.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a01_19']	悲護小乘，智護煩惱。	悲護小乘，智護煩惱。	064	Compassion protects the Lesser Vehicle, and wisdom protects afflictions.

['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a03_21']	疏「既三俱」下，第二通例。	疏「既三俱」下，第二通例。	064	The second general example is below since the three are together.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a04_18']	觀即煩惱護凡、悲即護小，二護即具二利。	觀即煩惱護凡、悲即護小，二護即具二利。	064	Observation is the protection of the ordinary, and compassion is the protection of the Lesser Vehicle. The two protections are equipped with the two benefits.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a06_2']	有智故不住生死，有悲故不住涅槃，故三義具矣。	有智故不住生死，有悲故不住涅槃，故三義具矣。	064	Because there is wisdom, one does not dwell in saṃsāra. Because there is compassion, one does not dwell in nirvāṇa. Therefore, the three meanings are complete.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a07_4']	疏「前滅後生」者，無明緣行，前緣已滅引起後故。	疏「前滅後生」者，無明緣行，前緣已滅引起後故。	064	As for the previous [link] ceases and the subsequent [link] arises, ignorance conditions formations, because the previous conditions have ceased and give rise to the subsequent.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a08_4']	若前不滅則墮常故，若後不生即是斷故。	若前不滅則墮常故，若後不生即是斷故。	064	If the previous [link] does not cease, it would fall into eternalism. If the subsequent [link] does not arise, it would be nihilism.
['ZH_T36_1736_064:0513a09_14']	無明緣行者，由前滅故後方得生，十二支皆然，自是一義釋之。	無明緣行者，由前滅故後方得生，十二支皆然，自是一義釋之。	064	As for ignorance being a condition for karmic formations, it is because of the cessation of the former that the latter can arise. This is the case for all twelve links. This is one interpretation.
