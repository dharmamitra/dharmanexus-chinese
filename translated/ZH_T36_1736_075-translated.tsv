Because the arising, etc. that are to be eliminated have a sequence, by not not-ing them, a sequence is also formed, therefore the passage first clarifies.

It is exactly the same as the meaning of non-arising and non-extinction within the vastness of the ten grounds, not just extinguished once.

['ZH_T36_1736_075:0591b13_13']	二明涅槃非幻，為破著涅槃心，云如幻耳。	二明涅槃非幻，為破著涅槃心，云如幻耳。	075	Second, it clarifies that nirvāṇa is not an illusion, but in order to destroy the mind that clings to nirvāṇa, it is said to be like an illusion.

['ZH_T36_1736_075:0591b26_7']	於中言「以第二為因」者，從緣生故，令悟第三即是依他。	於中言「以第二為因」者，從緣生故，令悟第三即是依他。	075	Within this, it says Taking the second as the cause means that because it arises from conditions, it causes the realization of the third, which is the dependent nature.
['ZH_T36_1736_075:0591b26_19']	「成第四」者，即事歸理。	「成第四」者，即事歸理。	075	Accomplishing the fourth means returning phenomena to principle.
['ZH_T36_1736_075:0591b27_10']	「遣第五病」者，遍計情亡。	「遣第五病」者，遍計情亡。	075	Eliminating the fifth illness means the imagined emotions are gone.

['ZH_T36_1736_075:0591c01_11']	若以第二惑業為緣，令第三依他為無性者，第二業惑應當是實，不從緣故。	若以第二惑業為緣，令第三依他為無性者，第二業惑應當是實，不從緣故。	075	If the second delusion and karma are taken as conditions to make the third dependent nature without nature, then the second karma and delusion should be real, because they are not from conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_075:0591c01_16']	故今釋云：	故今釋云：	075	Therefore, the explanation now says:
['ZH_T36_1736_075:0591c03_17']	亦從緣起，謂業從惑生，惑由虛妄分別，卒至無住皆託因緣，故引《中論》明因果俱幻。	亦從緣起，謂業從惑生，惑由虛妄分別，卒至無住皆託因緣，故引《中論》明因果俱幻。	075	They also arise from conditions. Karma arises from delusion, and delusion is due to false discrimination. Ultimately, they all rely on causes and conditions. Therefore, the Zhong lun is quoted to clarify that cause and effect are both illusory.

This is the emptiness of the essence of distinctions, which is the same as the unimpeded interpenetration of the essence and phenomena, and the phenomena and phenomena. Therefore, it is not different.
['ZH_T36_1736_075:0593c08_6']	言「攝末所歸之本」者，即差別之體空也。	言「攝末所歸之本」者，即差別之體空也。	075	As for taking the branches to return to the root, this refers to the emptiness of the essence of distinctions.

['ZH_T36_1736_075:0593c19_14']	故云「前二經文不相離故」。	故云「前二經文不相離故」。	075	Therefore it is said that the texts of the two sūtras are inseparable.

This sentence also combines the first two sentences to form this sentence. That is, the distinctions that are empty of essence and the unchanging that follow conditions are combined to form non-differentiation.
