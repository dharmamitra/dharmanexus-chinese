['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436b29_6']	聲聞以見諦為麁、思惟為細，菩薩以三界為麁、習氣為細。	聲聞以見諦為麁、思惟為細，菩薩以三界為麁、習氣為細。	015	The śrāvaka takes the view of reality as coarse and contemplation as fine, while the bodhisattva takes the three realms as coarse and habitual tendencies as fine.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c01_8']	今六位終心，斷三界結盡，如須陀洹斷見諦盡也。	今六位終心，斷三界結盡，如須陀洹斷見諦盡也。	015	Now, the final mind of the six stages ends the bonds of the three realms, like the srota-āpanna ending the view of reality.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c02_6']	七住始侵習氣，如斯陀含侵思惟結也。	七住始侵習氣，如斯陀含侵思惟結也。	015	The seventh stage begins to encroach on habitual tendencies, like the sakṛd-āgāmin encroaching on the bonds of contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c02_10']	寶亮曰：	寶亮曰：	015	Bao Liang said:

['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c06_1']	但使欲界一豪惑未盡，猶名斯陀含，以未離欲界故也。	但使欲界一豪惑未盡，猶名斯陀含，以未離欲界故也。	015	But as long as even a single hair of affliction in the desire realm has not been exhausted, it is still called sakṛd-āgāmin, because one has not yet left the desire realm.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c07_8']	阿那含人是名第三。	阿那含人是名第三。	015	The anāgāmin is called the third.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c07_13']	案僧宗曰：	案僧宗曰：	015	According to Seng Zong:
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c09_16']	欲界惑盡，侵上二界思惟，不還下界受生，明八地以上，斷三界外若麁若細，不復還三界受生。	欲界惑盡，侵上二界思惟，不還下界受生，明八地以上，斷三界外若麁若細，不復還三界受生。	015	When the afflictions of the desire realm are exhausted, one invades the thoughts of the two upper realms, and does not return to the lower realms to take rebirth. It is clear that above the eighth ground, one cuts off the coarse and subtle [afflictions] outside the three realms, and does not return to the three realms to take rebirth.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c10_10']	而七地不爾，容有身在欲界。	而七地不爾，容有身在欲界。	015	But the seventh ground is not like this, and it is possible for the body to be in the desire realm.

['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c12_16']	論此義勢，應通十地，但為讚歎十地以配第四人故也。	論此義勢，應通十地，但為讚歎十地以配第四人故也。	015	The momentum of this meaning should extend to the ten grounds, but it is only in order to praise the ten grounds and match them with the fourth person.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c13_1']	寶亮曰：	寶亮曰：	015	Baoliang said:
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c15_1']	六地滿足，後更進所斷，訖乎九地斷色心塵，麁障已盡，不復受三界生，故取類第三果人。	六地滿足，後更進所斷，訖乎九地斷色心塵，麁障已盡，不復受三界生，故取類第三果人。	015	After fulfilling the sixth ground, one further progresses in cutting off [afflictions] up to the ninth ground, cutting off the coarse hindrances of form and mind, and having exhausted them, one no longer takes rebirth in the three realms, thus taking the third fruition person as a class.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c16_8']	阿羅漢人是名第四。	阿羅漢人是名第四。	015	The arhat is called the fourth.

['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c18_4']	是故前問云：	是故前問云：	015	Therefore, the previous question says:
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c18_17']	實非阿羅漢，量與羅漢等也。	實非阿羅漢，量與羅漢等也。	015	Truly not an arhat, yet equal in measure to an arhat.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c19_2']	事乃應喻。	事乃應喻。	015	The matter then corresponds to the analogy.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c20_10']	聲聞羅漢既位隣於佛，以其智用明勝形儀，量與佛羅漢等也。	聲聞羅漢既位隣於佛，以其智用明勝形儀，量與佛羅漢等也。	015	Since the śrāvaka arhat is already at the same level as the Buddha, with his wisdom and function being supremely bright and his appearance equal in measure to the Buddha and arhat.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c20_14']	寶亮曰：	寶亮曰：	015	Baoliang says:
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c22_18']	羅漢斷三界結盡，而習氣未除，以類十地菩薩斷色心麁障乃盡，而色心集起之源未斷，以為類也。	羅漢斷三界結盡，而習氣未除，以類十地菩薩斷色心麁障乃盡，而色心集起之源未斷，以為類也。	015	The arhat has ended the bonds of the three realms, but the habitual tendencies have not yet been eliminated. This is similar to the bodhisattva of the ten grounds who has ended the coarse hindrances of form and mind, but has not yet ended the source of the accumulation of form and mind, and is taken as a comparison.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c23_2']	智秀曰：	智秀曰：	015	Zhishou says:
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c24_3']	羅漢是四果之極，十地是萬行之極，義是同也。	羅漢是四果之極，十地是萬行之極，義是同也。	015	The arhat is the ultimate of the four fruits, and the ten grounds are the ultimate of the myriad practices. The meaning is the same.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c25_17']	是四種人出現於世至為世間依安樂人天。	是四種人出現於世至為世間依安樂人天。	015	These four kinds of people appear in the world, becoming a reliance for the world and bringing peace and happiness to humans and gods.

['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c28_4']	案僧宗曰：	案僧宗曰：	015	According to Sengzong:
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0436c29_13']	向合則為四、開則為八，是為聲聞之與菩薩各有其向，則成八也。	向合則為四、開則為八，是為聲聞之與菩薩各有其向，則成八也。	015	If combined, there are four, if opened, there are eight. This is the distinction between the śrāvaka and the bodhisattva, which together form eight.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0437a02_2']	猶如第十六心結成初果，十五心已來為近向，五方便為遠向。	猶如第十六心結成初果，十五心已來為近向，五方便為遠向。	015	It is like the sixteenth thought that forms the first fruit. The fifteen thoughts before are the proximate distinction, and the five skillful means are the distant distinction.

['ZH_T37_1763_015:0437a04_13']	羅漢以三界盡為果，無礙道以還為向，中聞果向以意唯擬。	羅漢以三界盡為果，無礙道以還為向，中聞果向以意唯擬。	015	For the arhat, the exhaustion of the three realms is the fruit, and the path of no obstacles and below are the distinctions. The distinction between the fruit and the path of the middle hearing is intended.
['ZH_T37_1763_015:0437a05_8']	是則第八名同、高下為異也。	是則第八名同、高下為異也。	015	This is then the eighth name, with the difference being in the high and low.
