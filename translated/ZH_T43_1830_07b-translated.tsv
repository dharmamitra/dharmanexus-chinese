['ZH_T43_1830_07b:0487a21_9']	其識體所變依他性相分。	其識體所變依他性相分。	The appearance portion of the dependent nature that is transformed by the substance of consciousness,
['ZH_T43_1830_07b:0487a22_2']	似所執相分者名所分別。	似所執相分者名所分別。	which resembles the grasped portion, is called the discriminated.
['ZH_T43_1830_07b:0487a22_15']	是前能分別見分之所取相故。	是前能分別見分之所取相故。	This is because it is the grasped aspect of the seeing portion that is able to discriminate.

['ZH_T43_1830_07b:0487a29_3']	故彼所計心外實我法。	故彼所計心外實我法。	Therefore, the real selves and dharmas outside of the mind that are imagined by the Sāṃkhyas and others,

['ZH_T43_1830_07b:0487b01_7']	非謂識變是實我法。	非謂識變是實我法。	It is not that the transformations of consciousness are real selves and dharmas,
