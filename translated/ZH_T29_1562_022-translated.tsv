['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c20_10']	謂若略說，欲界人、天，并及下三靜慮、無色，此七生處是識住體。	謂若略說，欲界人、天，并及下三靜慮、無色，此七生處是識住體。	022	In brief, it refers to the seven places of birth in the desire realm, human and heavenly, and the three lower concentrations and formless [realms], which are the essence of the abodes of consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c21_1']	若廣分別，應隨契經。	若廣分別，應隨契經。	022	If broadly distinguished, it should follow the sūtras.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c22_3']	有色有情身異相異，如人、一分天，是第一識住。	有色有情身異相異，如人、一分天，是第一識住。	022	Sentient beings with form, different bodies and different perceptions, like humans and a part of the gods, are the first abode of consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c23_2']	一分天者，謂欲界天及初靜慮，除劫初起。	一分天者，謂欲界天及初靜慮，除劫初起。	022	The phrase “some gods” refers to the gods of the desire realm and the first meditative absorption, with the exception of those born at the beginning of the eon.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c23_16']	言有色有情者，是成就色身義。	言有色有情者，是成就色身義。	022	The phrase “those sentient beings who possess form” means those who have a physical body.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c24_15']	言身異者，謂彼色身種種顯形，狀貌異故。	言身異者，謂彼色身種種顯形，狀貌異故。	022	The phrase “whose bodies are different” means that their physical bodies have various appearances, shapes, and forms.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c25_15']	彼由身異，或有異身，故彼有情說名身異。	彼由身異，或有異身，故彼有情說名身異。	022	They are said to have different bodies because they have different bodies or because they have different kinds of bodies.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c26_12']	言想異者，謂彼苦樂不苦不樂想差別故。	言想異者，謂彼苦樂不苦不樂想差別故。	022	The phrase “whose thoughts are different” means that they have the thoughts of pleasure, suffering, and neither pleasure nor suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c28_2']	彼由想異，或有異想、或習異想以成其性，故彼有情說名想異。	彼由想異，或有異想、或習異想以成其性，故彼有情說名想異。	022	They are said to have different thoughts because they have different thoughts or because they have the nature of having different thoughts.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c28_7']	今應思擇：	今應思擇：	022	Now we must consider the following question:
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0461c29_10']	豈不後有身異言故有色已成，前有色言應無義用。	豈不後有身異言故有色已成，前有色言應無義用。	022	Since the phrase “whose bodies are different” in the second part of the passage already indicates that these beings possess form, is the phrase “those sentient beings who possess form” in the first part of the passage not redundant?
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a01_9']	此責非理，於無色中現見亦有說身言故。	此責非理，於無色中現見亦有說身言故。	022	This objection is not reasonable because the term “body” is also seen in the formless realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a03_7']	若謂身後有想異言，已證身言唯詮色者，亦不應理，除想已外餘無色中有疑濫故。	若謂身後有想異言，已證身言唯詮色者，亦不應理，除想已外餘無色中有疑濫故。	022	If you say that the phrase “having a body” refers only to form because the phrase “having a different ideation” refers to a later existence, this is not reasonable, because there is no doubt or confusion about the phrase “having a body” apart from the phrase “having a different ideation.”
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a05_5', 'ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a07_3']	或復謂後有如人言，故前身言無有濫者，此亦非理，由後說有一分天言容有濫故。🔽若謂不以一分天言令彼身言濫於無色，依次第故，又於次後說梵眾等諸天言故。	或復謂後有如人言，故前身言無有濫者，此亦非理，由後說有一分天言容有濫故。 若謂不以一分天言令彼身言濫於無色，依次第故，又於次後說梵眾等諸天言故。	022	If you say that the phrase “having a body” is not confused with the formless realm because it refers to a later existence as in the phrase “having a different ideation,” this is also unreasonable, because the phrase “having a different ideation” may be confused with the phrase “having a different ideation in part of the heavens.”
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a08_15']	理亦不然，非遍說故，非後遍說一切天眾皆建立在餘識住中，勿有生疑。	理亦不然，非遍說故，非後遍說一切天眾皆建立在餘識住中，勿有生疑。	022	If you say that the phrase “having a body” is not confused with the formless realm because it refers to a later existence as in the phrase “having a different ideation in part of the heavens,” this is also unreasonable, because it is not a complete explanation. It is not a complete explanation of all the heavenly multitudes in the later existence, because there is no doubt or confusion about the phrase “having a body.”
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a10_17']	一分天者，兼攝有頂第四靜慮，故說有色及身異言，非有頂天可言有色，第四靜慮可言身異。	一分天者，兼攝有頂第四靜慮，故說有色及身異言，非有頂天可言有色，第四靜慮可言身異。	022	The phrase “having a different ideation in part of the heavens” includes the fourth trance state of the summit of existence, and therefore it speaks of “having a body” and “having a different body.” But the heavens of the summit of existence cannot be said to “have a body,” and the fourth trance state cannot be said to “have a different body.”
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a12_16']	一分天言已簡惡處，餘人天眾各自名顯，故此所說一分天言，所攝如前，其義成立。	一分天言已簡惡處，餘人天眾各自名顯，故此所說一分天言，所攝如前，其義成立。	022	The phrase “a certain class of gods” excludes evil destinies. The remaining gods and humans are each named explicitly. Therefore, the phrase “a certain class of gods” includes the above-mentioned gods. Its meaning is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a14_5']	由斯有頂、第四靜慮及諸惡處，非識住攝，故有色言具大義用。	由斯有頂、第四靜慮及諸惡處，非識住攝，故有色言具大義用。	022	Because of this, the peak of existence, the fourth trance state, and the evil destinies are not included in the abodes of consciousness. Therefore, the phrase “those who have form” has a great meaning and function.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a15_4']	或言有色為顯異因，謂身異因即是有色。	或言有色為顯異因，謂身異因即是有色。	022	Or, the phrase “those who have form” is used to show a different cause, namely, that the cause of the difference in bodies is having form.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a15_14']	要由有色，身方有異；	要由有色，身方有異；	022	Only because of having form does the body have a difference.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a16_12']	由身有異，想異得成，故有色言顯異因性。	由身有異，想異得成，故有色言顯異因性。	022	Because the body has a difference, the difference in conceptualization can be accomplished. Therefore, the phrase “those who have form” shows the nature of a different cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a17_2']	由能損益，勝境現前。	由能損益，勝境現前。	022	Because of the presence of superior objects that can harm or benefit.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a17_12']	損益身時，身便變異。	損益身時，身便變異。	022	When the body is harmed or benefited, the body then changes.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a18_10']	即於如是身變異時，令飲食等亦有變異。	即於如是身變異時，令飲食等亦有變異。	022	When the body changes in this way, it causes food and drink, etc., to also change.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a19_17']	彼變異故，身異得成，由是便生樂等異想，故言有色是顯異因。	彼變異故，身異得成，由是便生樂等異想，故言有色是顯異因。	022	Because of their change, the difference in bodies is accomplished. Because of this, pleasant, etc., conceptualization arises. Therefore, the phrase “those who have form” shows the cause of difference.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a20_18']	若必有色言顯身異因者，極光淨等身應有異。	若必有色言顯身異因者，極光淨等身應有異。	022	If the word “color” must indicate a different cause for the body, then the bodies of the gods of the Abhasvara heaven and above would have different causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a21_17']	又極光淨應無異想，由彼天中身無異故。	又極光淨應無異想，由彼天中身無異故。	022	Also, the gods of the Abhasvara heaven would have no different ideas, because their bodies would not be different.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a22_16']	又諸梵眾想應不一，由彼天中身有異故。	又諸梵眾想應不一，由彼天中身有異故。	022	Also, the ideas of the Brahmakāyika gods would not be the same, because their bodies would be different.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a23_7']	由斯所釋，理未必然。	由斯所釋，理未必然。	022	Therefore, the explanation given is not necessarily correct.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a23_17']	其理必然，異因定故。	其理必然，異因定故。	022	It is necessarily correct, because the different causes are definitely determined.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a25_17']	謂身有異，定色為因，非色為因令身定異，故極光淨等無身成異失，如眼色為緣生於眼識等。	謂身有異，定色為因，非色為因令身定異，故極光淨等無身成異失，如眼色為緣生於眼識等。	022	That is, the difference in bodies is definitely caused by color, not by non-color, which causes the difference in bodies. Therefore, the gods of the Abhasvara heaven and above do not have the fault of having different bodies, just as the eye and form are conditions that give rise to eye consciousness, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a26_3']	如契經說：	如契經說：	022	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a26_13']	眼色為緣，生於眼識。	眼色為緣，生於眼識。	022	The eye and form are conditions that give rise to eye consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a27_7']	現有眼色，眼識不生，餘亦應爾。	現有眼色，眼識不生，餘亦應爾。	022	Even though the eye and form are present, eye consciousness does not arise. The same should be true of the other [faculties and objects].
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a27_12']	又如經說：	又如經說：	022	Also, as a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a28_1']	身有輕安便生受樂。	身有輕安便生受樂。	022	When the body has lightness and agility, one gives rise to the pleasure of feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a29_6']	此經意顯無染受樂定輕安為因，非身輕安定能生受樂。	此經意顯無染受樂定輕安為因，非身輕安定能生受樂。	022	The meaning of this scripture is to show that the pleasure of feeling without defilements definitely has lightness and agility as its cause, and that lightness and agility of the body cannot give rise to the pleasure of feeling.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462a29_16']	此亦應爾，故理必然。	此亦應爾，故理必然。	022	This is also so, and therefore the principle is certain.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b01_17']	若謂眼色定為眼識緣，闕餘緣故，有眼識不起。	若謂眼色定為眼識緣，闕餘緣故，有眼識不起。	022	If it is said that eyes and form definitely serve as conditions for eye consciousness, but due to the absence of other conditions, eye consciousness does not arise,
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b02_2']	如契經說：	如契經說：	022	as a sutra says:
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b02_16']	能生作意若不正起，識不生故。	能生作意若不正起，識不生故。	022	If the attention that gives rise to [consciousness] does not arise correctly, consciousness does not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b03_14']	既許有色為身異因，復闕何緣令身不異？	既許有色為身異因，復闕何緣令身不異？	022	Since it is admitted that form exists as a cause for the difference in the body, what other condition is lacking that prevents the body from being different?
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b05_3']	又受樂體異於輕安，雖復輕安遍於諸地，無受樂地可不生樂。	又受樂體異於輕安，雖復輕安遍於諸地，無受樂地可不生樂。	022	Moreover, the substance of the experience of pleasure is different from tranquility. Even though tranquility pervades all stages, in stages where there is no experience of pleasure, pleasure should not arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b06_2']	有色身異既無別體，諸有色者皆應身異。	有色身異既無別體，諸有色者皆應身異。	022	Since the difference in the physical body has no separate substance, all those with form should have a different body.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b06_12']	此亦不然，與彼同故。	此亦不然，與彼同故。	022	This is also not so, because it is the same as that [difference in the body].
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b09_7']	雖諸有色皆身異因，有闕餘因而身不異，謂於欲界初靜慮中，有表無表尋伺多識為因生果，有種種異，故彼有色為身異因；	雖諸有色皆身異因，有闕餘因而身不異，謂於欲界初靜慮中，有表無表尋伺多識為因生果，有種種異，故彼有色為身異因；	022	Although all those with form are causes for the difference in the body, there are those who lack other causes and yet the body is not different. In the desire realm and first meditative absorption, there are bodily and verbal actions, unmanifesting form, discursive thought, applied thought, and many consciousnesses that serve as causes for the arising of results. There are various differences, and therefore those with form are causes for the difference in the body.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b10_7']	極光淨天等無彼因故，雖有色因而身但一。	極光淨天等無彼因故，雖有色因而身但一。	022	Because the gods of Abhasvara Heaven and above do not have that cause, even though they have form, their bodies are only one.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b11_9']	不可以說彼為身異因，則不許言有色故身異。	不可以說彼為身異因，則不許言有色故身異。	022	You cannot say that because they are said to be different causes of the body, you do not admit that because they have form, the body is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b12_8']	勿說作意能生眼識，便不許說眼色為緣。	勿說作意能生眼識，便不許說眼色為緣。	022	Do not say that because attention can produce eye consciousness, you do not admit that the eye and form are conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b13_9']	又彼不應以業生眼故，便不許說眼等為眼因。	又彼不應以業生眼故，便不許說眼等為眼因。	022	Also, they should not say that because the eye is produced by karma, you do not admit that the eye, etc. are the cause of the eye.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b14_11']	又彼不應以種生芽故，便不許說水糞等為因。	又彼不應以種生芽故，便不許說水糞等為因。	022	Also, they should not say that because seeds produce sprouts, you do not admit that water, manure, etc. are causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b15_1']	是故不應作如是難：	是故不應作如是難：	022	Therefore, you should not raise such an objection:
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b16_1']	以有色故令身異者，極光淨等身應有異。	以有色故令身異者，極光淨等身應有異。	022	Because they have form, you say that the body is different. The bodies of the gods of Abhasvara Heaven and above should be different.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b17_18']	言極光淨應無異想，由彼天中身無異者，亦不應理，由心於定有厭欣故，如說樂因。	言極光淨應無異想，由彼天中身無異者，亦不應理，由心於定有厭欣故，如說樂因。	022	It is unreasonable to say that the gods of Abhasvara Heaven have no different thoughts because their bodies are not different, because the mind has aversion and delight in samādhi, just as it is said that pleasure is a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b18_8']	又想異言，為遣疑故。	又想異言，為遣疑故。	022	Also, the statement about different thoughts is made to dispel doubt.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b19_2']	謂說身一，想應非異，心隨身故。	謂說身一，想應非異，心隨身故。	022	That is to say, if it is said that the body is one, the thoughts should not be different, because the mind follows the body.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b19_16']	為遣此中想隨身疑，故說想異。	為遣此中想隨身疑，故說想異。	022	In order to eliminate the doubt that thought follows the body in this heaven, it is said that thought is different.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b20_14']	此言意顯極光淨天心不隨身，與餘天別。	此言意顯極光淨天心不隨身，與餘天別。	022	The meaning of this statement is to show that the mind of the Heaven of Great Fruition does not follow the body, and is different from the other heavens.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b23_2']	言諸梵眾想應不一，由彼天中身有異者，理實應爾，但為顯示彼劫初時同於一因起一執想，故言想一。	言諸梵眾想應不一，由彼天中身有異者，理實應爾，但為顯示彼劫初時同於一因起一執想，故言想一。	022	It is said that the thought of the Brahmakāyika gods should not be the same, because there are differences in the bodies of those gods. This is indeed reasonable, but it is only to show that at the beginning of the kalpa, they give rise to the same thought based on one cause, so it is said that thought is the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b24_3']	是故前釋一分天言，亦攝梵眾天，唯除劫初起。	是故前釋一分天言，亦攝梵眾天，唯除劫初起。	022	Therefore, the previous explanation that the gods are only a part also includes the Brahmakāyika gods, except for those who arise at the beginning of the kalpa.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b25_4']	此言意顯彼想實異，但就少分緣義說為想一。	此言意顯彼想實異，但就少分緣義說為想一。	022	The meaning of this statement is to show that their thought is actually different, but based on a small part of the meaning, it is said that thought is the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b26_3']	由斯有色定是異因，故有色言深有義用。	由斯有色定是異因，故有色言深有義用。	022	Therefore, form is a different cause, so the word form has a profound meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b27_8']	有色有情，身異想一，如梵眾天，謂劫初起，是第二識住。	有色有情，身異想一，如梵眾天，謂劫初起，是第二識住。	022	Beings with form, with different bodies but the same thought, like the Brahmakāyika gods, refers to the second abode of consciousness at the beginning of the kalpa.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b27_13']	所以者何？	所以者何？	022	Why is this so?
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b28_7']	以劫初起，彼梵眾天同生此想：	以劫初起，彼梵眾天同生此想：	022	Because at the beginning of the kalpa, those Brahmakāyika gods give rise to the same thought:
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b28_16']	我等皆是大梵化生。	我等皆是大梵化生。	022	We are all born from the transformation of Mahābrahmā.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b29_6']	大梵爾時亦生此想：	大梵爾時亦生此想：	022	At that time, the great Brahma also gives rise to this thought:
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462b29_15']	是諸梵眾皆我化生。	是諸梵眾皆我化生。	022	All these Brahma hosts are born from my transformation.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462c01_5']	何緣梵眾同生此想？	何緣梵眾同生此想？	022	Why do the Brahma hosts give rise to this thought?
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462c02_4']	由見梵王處所形色及神通等皆殊勝故。	由見梵王處所形色及神通等皆殊勝故。	022	Because they see that the abode, form, and spiritual powers of the Brahma king are all superior.
['ZH_T29_1562_022:0462c03_3']	又觀大梵先時已有，已及餘天後方生故。	又觀大梵先時已有，已及餘天後方生故。	022	Moreover, they observe that the great Brahma existed before, and that he and the other gods were born later.
