They are called the bodhisattva's true great vows and true great practices.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0084b16_4']	言大願者，如經菩薩住般若心中，欲遍度一切眾生，令入無餘涅槃，而實無所度。	言大願者，如經菩薩住般若心中，欲遍度一切眾生，令入無餘涅槃，而實無所度。	001	As for the great vows, as the sutra says, The bodhisattva abides in the mind of prajñā, wishing to completely deliver all sentient beings and cause them to enter nirvāṇa without remainder, yet there is actually nothing to deliver.

The result of non-attainment is precisely the Tathāgata's true characteristic of the Dharma body.

Externally, one will be protected and remembered by the Buddhas. Internally, one will attain boundless merit and virtue that surpasses giving away the treasures of a trichiliocosm, and also surpasses giving away one's body and life as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River.

['ZH_T33_1699_001:0084c04_4']	不可說，言語滅，即是第一義悉檀。	不可說，言語滅，即是第一義悉檀。	001	and speech is extinguished, this is the supreme principle.

['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085a26_3']	所言無物相障者，眾生久劫已來，著我我所，多滯有病，是以如來說一切法皆畢竟空。	所言無物相障者，眾生久劫已來，著我我所，多滯有病，是以如來說一切法皆畢竟空。	001	As for the obstruction of the appearance of non-existence, sentient beings for a long time have been attached to self and what belongs to self, and are often obstructed by the illness of existence. Therefore, the Tathāgata taught that all dharmas are ultimately empty.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085a27_8']	但稟教之徒聞畢竟空，便起邪見，謂無因果，則失二諦。	但稟教之徒聞畢竟空，便起邪見，謂無因果，則失二諦。	001	However, those who receive the teachings, upon hearing ultimate emptiness, give rise to wrong views, thinking that there are no causes and effects, and thus lose the two truths.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085a27_18']	此之斷見，障於般若。	此之斷見，障於般若。	001	This view of annihilation obstructs prajñā.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085a28_7']	為此障故，佛說斯經。	為此障故，佛說斯經。	001	Because of this obstruction, the Buddha taught this sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b01_13']	如經「菩薩不住一切法行於布施等一切諸行」，故以萬行為因、法身為果，所以雖畢竟空，而因果無失也。	如經「菩薩不住一切法行於布施等一切諸行」，故以萬行為因、法身為果，所以雖畢竟空，而因果無失也。	001	As the sūtra says, The bodhisattva does not abide in any dharmas, yet practices giving and all other practices. Therefore, the myriad practices are the cause, and the Dharma body is the result. Even though it is ultimately empty, cause and effect are not lost.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b02_12']	所言有物相障者，前是斷見，今是常見。	所言有物相障者，前是斷見，今是常見。	001	As for the obstruction of the appearance of existence, the former is the view of annihilation, and the latter is the view of permanence.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b05_3']	稟教之徒既聞菩薩行因得果，便謂因是能感、果能酬有，能行之人、所行之行，是則無見雖泯，有念還生，故名為障。	稟教之徒既聞菩薩行因得果，便謂因是能感、果能酬有，能行之人、所行之行，是則無見雖泯，有念還生，故名為障。	001	The disciples who receive the teachings, having heard that bodhisattvas attain fruition by practicing causes, then consider causes to be able to attract and fruition to be able to repay existence, and the person who practices and the practice itself. This then is the arising of the notion of existence even though the view of non-existence has been eliminated, and is therefore called an obstruction.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b05_14']	為是障故，說般若治之。	為是障故，說般若治之。	001	Because it is an obstruction, the perfection of wisdom is taught to eliminate it.

['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b07_3']	若菩薩有我相、人相，則非菩薩，見有法相非法相，亦非菩薩。	若菩薩有我相、人相，則非菩薩，見有法相非法相，亦非菩薩。	001	If a bodhisattva has the notion of self or person, they are not a bodhisattva. Seeing the characteristics of dharmas and the absence of characteristics of non-dharmas, they are also not a bodhisattva.
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b09_6']	雖復行施，三事恒空，因果宛然，而未曾感應，類如空中種樹，亦同空裏織羅，豈得聞有便起常見？	雖復行施，三事恒空，因果宛然，而未曾感應，類如空中種樹，亦同空裏織羅，豈得聞有便起常見？	001	Even though they practice giving, the three aspects are always empty, yet cause and effect are still distinct. But it has never been the case that there is a response, like planting a tree in the sky, or weaving a cloth in the sky. How can one hear of existence and immediately give rise to the view of permanence?
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b10_16']	所言非有似有相障者，稟教之徒聞上菩薩不著有無，而便生異見：	所言非有似有相障者，稟教之徒聞上菩薩不著有無，而便生異見：	001	As for the obstruction of the appearance of non-existence resembling existence, the disciples who receive the teachings hear that the bodhisattvas above are not attached to existence or non-existence, and then give rise to different views:
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b11_14']	若使有無皆不可得，何得有萬用不同？	若使有無皆不可得，何得有萬用不同？	001	If it is the case that existence and non-existence are both unobtainable, how can there be myriad functions that are not the same?
['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b12_17']	故如六塵異對、四大互反，以有萬用，故知不無。	故如六塵異對、四大互反，以有萬用，故知不無。	001	Therefore, just as the six sense objects are different from each other, and the four great elements mutually oppose each other, there are myriad functions, so we know they are not nonexistent.

Having this view of emptiness, they slander buddha-nature.

['ZH_T33_1699_001:0085b28_18']	今婆藪弟子明般若、佛性，乃是眼目異名，是故般若亦明佛性。	今婆藪弟子明般若、佛性，乃是眼目異名，是故般若亦明佛性。	001	Now the disciples of Vasubandhu explain that prajna and buddha-nature are simply different names for the same thing, so prajna also explains buddha-nature.

For example, the Samkhya school believes in identity, the Vaisesika school believes in difference, the Jains believe in both identity and difference, and Ajita Kesakambala believes in neither identity nor difference. These four attachments all obstruct prajna.

It was precisely to clarify the extremely deep principle of emptiness and transform beings attached to appearances. It wanted to have the close disciples understand it first. Based on this, they could transmit the teaching and meaning, and thus the śrāvakas assisted the Buddha in spreading the teaching.
