['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a07_17']	4 辯業品1 一辯業品第四之一此中一類隨順造惡怯難論者，作如是言：	4 辯業品1 一辯業品第四之一此中一類隨順造惡怯難論者，作如是言：	033	Here, a certain type of person who follows and creates evil, timidly and with difficulty, says:
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a08_16']	如上所陳諸內外事多種差別，非業為因；	如上所陳諸內外事多種差別，非業為因；	033	The various internal and external things mentioned above have many kinds of distinctions, and are not caused by karma;
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a09_15']	現見世間果石等物眾多差別，無異因故。	現見世間果石等物眾多差別，無異因故。	033	It is currently seen in the world that fruits, stones, and other things have many distinctions, because there are no different causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a11_14']	謂從一種有多果生，無種為先有石等異，棘鋒銛利豆皮黑等，眾相差別，是誰所為？	謂從一種有多果生，無種為先有石等異，棘鋒銛利豆皮黑等，眾相差別，是誰所為？	033	That is to say, from one kind, many fruits are produced. Without seeds as a prior condition, there are differences in stones, etc. The various characteristics of thorns, sharpness, and bean husks are black, etc. Who created these distinctions?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a13_14']	若必情欣有因論者，應言精血為內法因，種等為因生外芽等，見由彼差別，此有差別故。	若必情欣有因論者，應言精血為內法因，種等為因生外芽等，見由彼差別，此有差別故。	033	If one must be delighted and have a theory of causes, one should say that semen and blood are the internal causes of dharmas, and seeds, etc. are the causes that produce external sprouts, etc. It is seen that due to their distinctions, these have distinctions. Therefore,
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a14_13']	如果等異，無現異因，不現見因亦應非有。	如果等異，無現異因，不現見因亦應非有。	033	If the differences in fruits, etc. have no presently different causes, the non-apparent causes should also not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a15_3']	為對彼執，故立宗言。	為對彼執，故立宗言。	033	In response to those attachments, we establish the thesis.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a15_6']	頌曰：	頌曰：	033	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a16_0']	世別由業生，　　思及思所作，	世別由業生，　　思及思所作，	033	The differences in the world arise from karma, which is volition and what is produced by volition.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a17_13']	思即是意業，　　所作謂身語。	思即是意業，　　所作謂身語。	033	Volition is precisely mental karma, and what is produced refers to bodily and verbal [karma].
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a18_2']	論曰：	論曰：	033	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a19_1']	定由有情淨不淨業，諸內外事種種不同。	定由有情淨不淨業，諸內外事種種不同。	033	It is definitely due to the pure and impure karma of sentient beings that the various internal and external things have different characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a19_6']	云何知然？	云何知然？	033	How do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a19_11']	見業用故。	見業用故。	033	Because we see the function of karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a20_10']	謂世現見，愛非愛果差別生時，定由業用。	謂世現見，愛非愛果差別生時，定由業用。	033	This means that the world presently sees that when the differences in desirable and undesirable fruits arise, they are definitely due to the function of karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a21_10']	如農夫類，由勤正業，有稼穡等可愛果生。	如農夫類，由勤正業，有稼穡等可愛果生。	033	It is like farmers who, due to their diligent and correct work, give rise to desirable fruits such as abundant harvests.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a22_10']	有諸愚夫行盜等業，便招非愛殺縛等果。	有諸愚夫行盜等業，便招非愛殺縛等果。	033	There are also foolish people who engage in actions such as stealing and thus invite undesirable fruits such as being killed or bound.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a23_8']	復見亦有從初處胎，不由現因有樂有苦。	復見亦有從初處胎，不由現因有樂有苦。	033	We also see that there are those who, from the very beginning of entering the womb, experience pleasure or pain without any present causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a25_14']	既見現在要業為先，方能引得愛非愛果，知前樂苦必業為先，故非無因諸內外事自然而有種種差別。	既見現在要業為先，方能引得愛非愛果，知前樂苦必業為先，故非無因諸內外事自然而有種種差別。	033	Since we see that present effects must be preceded by prior activity, which then attracts pleasant or unpleasant effects, we know that past happiness and suffering must also have been preceded by activity. Therefore internal and external things do not exist without causes, and their various distinctions are not spontaneous.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a27_2']	又世現見，造善者少、造惡者多，然於世間有情樂少苦多。	又世現見，造善者少、造惡者多，然於世間有情樂少苦多。	033	Also, we see in the world that those who do good are few, while those who do evil are many, and yet among sentient beings, those who are happy are few, while those who suffer are many.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529a29_4']	可得以現見為門，非現見成故，謂世現見造作種種淨不淨業為因緣故，便有種種樂苦果生。	可得以現見為門，非現見成故，謂世現見造作種種淨不淨業為因緣故，便有種種樂苦果生。	033	This can be taken as a gateway to what is seen, but it is not established by what is seen. That is to say, we see in the world that various pleasant and painful effects arise as a result of the causes and conditions of creating various pure and impure actions.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b01_3']	又見勤修如法行者，諸根怡悅、心寂安泰。	又見勤修如法行者，諸根怡悅、心寂安泰。	033	Also, we see that those who diligently practice in accordance with the Dharma have joyful faculties and a peaceful and secure mind.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b02_3']	若為貪等猛焰纏逼，行非法行，與上相違。	若為貪等猛焰纏逼，行非法行，與上相違。	033	If they are tormented by the raging flames of greed and so forth, and engage in improper conduct, it is the opposite of the above.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b03_2']	又見世間如法行者，便得供養恭敬附託；	又見世間如法行者，便得供養恭敬附託；	033	Also, we see that those who act in accordance with the Dharma in the world obtain offerings, respect, and support;
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b03_12']	非法行者，與此相違。	非法行者，與此相違。	033	those who act improperly are the opposite of this.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b05_4']	由所現見法非法因果，足可比度不現見果因，亦見世間與上相違者。	由所現見法非法因果，足可比度不現見果因，亦見世間與上相違者。	033	The seen effects of good and evil are sufficient to infer the unseen causes of effects. This is also seen in the world, where there are those who contradict the above.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b05_15']	此不違理，以有餘因故。	此不違理，以有餘因故。	033	This does not contradict reason, because there are other causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b07_7']	謂見世間有造眾惡而似感得心歡悅者，是先善業果、或現加行生。	謂見世間有造眾惡而似感得心歡悅者，是先善業果、或現加行生。	033	It is seen in the world that some who commit many evils seem to experience mental joy, which is the effect of past good karma or arises from present practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b09_7']	或有由斯招他敬養等，應知亦是現不現因生，如有智人為湯所瀹，便能了痛因火非水。	或有由斯招他敬養等，應知亦是現不現因生，如有智人為湯所瀹，便能了痛因火非水。	033	Or some attract others' respect and support, etc., due to this, which should be known as arising from present and unseen causes. Just as a wise person, when scalded by hot water, can understand that the pain is caused by fire, not water.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b10_7']	如是智者應當審思，諸樂果生由善非惡。	如是智者應當審思，諸樂果生由善非惡。	033	In the same way, the wise should carefully consider that the arising of pleasant effects is due to good, not evil.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b11_7']	又世現見，久習貪等貪等便增，慧等亦爾。	又世現見，久習貪等貪等便增，慧等亦爾。	033	Moreover, the world presently sees that by long habituation to greed, etc., greed increases, and the same is so for wisdom, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b12_14']	然復見有不由久習而貪慧等自性猛利，智者應知是先業果。	然復見有不由久習而貪慧等自性猛利，智者應知是先業果。	033	However, it is also seen that some, without long habituation, have naturally intense greed, wisdom, etc. The wise should know that this is the effect of past karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b13_16']	若他敬等因惡行生，應諸行惡行皆招他敬等。	若他敬等因惡行生，應諸行惡行皆招他敬等。	033	If respect from others, etc., arise from evil conduct, then all who engage in evil conduct should attract respect from others, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b15_13']	故有許可善巧親密諸現因緣得敬養者，應知以此助餘善業，令其有力能與自果。	故有許可善巧親密諸現因緣得敬養者，應知以此助餘善業，令其有力能與自果。	033	Therefore, those who obtain respect and support through skillful means, intimacy, and various present conditions should know that this assists other good karma, enabling it to have the power to give its own fruits.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b17_13']	行獵獸等諸惡行時，由不正思便生歡悅，妄自慶慰謂為樂者，是造業時，非受果位。	行獵獸等諸惡行時，由不正思便生歡悅，妄自慶慰謂為樂者，是造業時，非受果位。	033	When engaging in evil conduct such as hunting, due to improper thought one gives rise to joy and falsely congratulates oneself, thinking it is happiness. This is at the time of creating karma, not the stage of receiving its fruits.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b18_12']	有業皆受，現在雖樂，而感當來苦異熟果。	有業皆受，現在雖樂，而感當來苦異熟果。	033	There is karma that is all experienced. Although one is happy in the present, it brings about the ripening of suffering in the future.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b19_11']	是故智者應善觀察，勿耽小樂而招大苦。	是故智者應善觀察，勿耽小樂而招大苦。	033	Therefore, the wise should observe well, not indulging in small pleasures that will bring great suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b21_1']	又見戰等，殺害為因，便蒙賞賴勝財位者，此亦為緣助先善業；	又見戰等，殺害為因，便蒙賞賴勝財位者，此亦為緣助先善業；	033	Moreover, seeing that battles and so forth, taken as causes for killing, bring about rewards of superior wealth and status, this also serves as a condition assisting previous good karma.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b22_1']	若異此者應俱蒙賴，或害己朋亦應獲賞。	若異此者應俱蒙賴，或害己朋亦應獲賞。	033	If it were otherwise, all should receive rewards, or even harming one's own group should also bring rewards.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b23_18']	又同事業所獲有殊，由此應知，現士用等但能緣助不現見因，令彼能招敬財位等。	又同事業所獲有殊，由此應知，現士用等但能緣助不現見因，令彼能招敬財位等。	033	Moreover, the gains from engaging in the same activity vary. From this one should understand that the present human effort and so forth can only serve as conditions for the unseen causes, enabling them to bring about respect, wealth, status, and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b26_16']	又見有造淨不淨業，而現獲得毀讚衰利，與所造因相違果者，應知此為餘業所伏，未得自果、但為他緣，非例無因世間生起。	又見有造淨不淨業，而現獲得毀讚衰利，與所造因相違果者，應知此為餘業所伏，未得自果、但為他緣，非例無因世間生起。	033	Also, you see that people create pure and impure karma, but in the present they obtain blame, praise, humiliation, and profit, which are results that are contrary to the causes they created. You should know that this is because other karma restrains them. They do not obtain their own results but are only conditions for others. This is not an example of the origination of the world without a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529b28_6']	又彼既許世所現見，種等為因能生芽等，故無因論理自不成。	又彼既許世所現見，種等為因能生芽等，故無因論理自不成。	033	Also, since you admit that what is seen in the world is that seeds, etc., are causes that produce sprouts, etc., therefore the theory of no cause is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c01_13']	又不可言有情身等但由現在加行力生，如芽等生唯從種等，以外種等生芽等時非離有情業增上故。	又不可言有情身等但由現在加行力生，如芽等生唯從種等，以外種等生芽等時非離有情業增上故。	033	Also, you cannot say that the bodies, etc., of sentient beings are born only through the power of present activity, as sprouts, etc., are born only from seeds, etc., because when external seeds, etc., produce sprouts, etc., it is not the case that they do so apart from the dominant influence of the karma of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c03_12']	又若諸法無因生者，則應一切由一切物、於一切時一切生起，何須計度種等別因？	又若諸法無因生者，則應一切由一切物、於一切時一切生起，何須計度種等別因？	033	Also, if dharmas are born without a cause, then everything would be born from everything at all times. Why would you need to imagine that seeds, etc., are separate causes?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c05_2']	諸芽等生可由業力，毒刺等物應非業生，以非有情所須用故。	諸芽等生可由業力，毒刺等物應非業生，以非有情所須用故。	033	The birth of sprouts, etc., may be due to the power of karma, but poisonous plants, etc., should not be born from karma, because they are not used by sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c06_2']	此難非理，現不現見麁細有情所須用故。	此難非理，現不現見麁細有情所須用故。	033	This objection is unreasonable, because what is needed by gross and subtle sentient beings is used, whether it is seen or not.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c07_10']	又所須用種種不同，謂令有情眾同分等生位增長，皆名須用；	又所須用種種不同，謂令有情眾同分等生位增長，皆名須用；	033	Moreover, what is needed is not the same for all. That which causes the continuity of sentient beings to be born and grow is all called what is needed.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c08_1']	設非所食，須用義成。	設非所食，須用義成。	033	Even if it is not food, it still has the meaning of what is needed.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c09_15']	若諸世間內外差別，皆有情業增上所生，何緣鉢特摩、嗢鉢羅花等色香美妙？	若諸世間內外差別，皆有情業增上所生，何緣鉢特摩、嗢鉢羅花等色香美妙？	033	If the internal and external differences in the world are all produced by the dominant power of the karma of sentient beings, why are the colors, fragrances, and flavors of the pattra and utpala flowers, etc., so beautiful?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c10_19']	非有情身，由諸有情共不共業，所生諸果有差別故。	非有情身，由諸有情共不共業，所生諸果有差別故。	033	It is because the various fruits produced by the common and uncommon karma of sentient beings have differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c11_17']	謂諸有情造共淨業，生蓮花等美妙色香；	謂諸有情造共淨業，生蓮花等美妙色香；	033	That is, sentient beings create common pure karma and are born with beautiful colors and fragrances, like lotus flowers, etc.;
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c12_8']	共不淨業，生毒刺等。	共不淨業，生毒刺等。	033	Common impure karma produces poisonous thorns, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c14_1']	由不共業感有情身，雜思業生故有淨穢，與蓮花等不可例同，理必應然。	由不共業感有情身，雜思業生故有淨穢，與蓮花等不可例同，理必應然。	033	The bodies of sentient beings are produced by uncommon karma, because mixed thoughts and karma produce purity and impurity. They cannot be compared to lotus flowers, etc. This principle must be so.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c15_5']	以諸天等純淨業感，故彼內身及外資緣皆同美妙。	以諸天等純淨業感，故彼內身及外資緣皆同美妙。	033	Because the heavens and so forth are produced by pure karma, both the internal body and external resources are all of exquisite beauty.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c16_17']	然不肖者，以見世間樂施者貧苦、慳悋者富樂，便增邪見謂果無因。	然不肖者，以見世間樂施者貧苦、慳悋者富樂，便增邪見謂果無因。	033	However, the inferior person sees that the generous are poor and suffering, while the miserly are rich and happy, and so he increases his wrong views and says that effects have no causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c18_4']	此由於田及思數習所得異熟、增上、等流果差別中不了達故。	此由於田及思數習所得異熟、增上、等流果差別中不了達故。	033	This is because he does not understand the distinctions among the karmic rewards obtained from the field, thought, and frequent practice.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c20_2']	謂有先世於良福田暫植施因，故招富樂，然不數習能捨物思，故於今生仍懷慳悋。	謂有先世於良福田暫植施因，故招富樂，然不數習能捨物思，故於今生仍懷慳悋。	033	There are those who in a past life temporarily planted the cause of generosity in a good field, and so they attract rich happiness, but because they did not frequently practice the thought of giving up things, they still harbor miserliness in this life.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c21_1']	若有先世數施非田，則於今生貧窮樂施。	若有先世數施非田，則於今生貧窮樂施。	033	If there are those who frequently gave in a past life but not to a field of merit, then in this life they are poor but enjoy giving.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c21_10']	於如是義何致愚迷？	於如是義何致愚迷？	033	How can one be confused about this truth?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c23_1']	故由有情先世業力及現士用，二種世間差別果生，理善成立。	故由有情先世業力及現士用，二種世間差別果生，理善成立。	033	Therefore, the arising of the distinctions of the two worlds, the world of sentient beings and the world of their karma, is well established due to the power of sentient beings' past karma and their present human effort.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c23_10']	惡因論者作是詰言：	惡因論者作是詰言：	033	The proponents of evil causes ask this question:
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c24_7']	如何定知害得非愛果、不害得愛果？	如何定知害得非愛果、不害得愛果？	033	How do we definitely know that harming leads to undesirable results and not harming leads to desirable results?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c25_6']	非此相違，應從二因各生二果，此如前釋。	非此相違，應從二因各生二果，此如前釋。	033	It is not the case that from these two causes each produces two results. This is as explained before.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c25_11']	前釋者何？	前釋者何？	033	What was the previous explanation?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c27_17']	謂世現見造善者少、造惡者多，然於世間有情樂少苦多，可得如是世間諸有情類多行殺害、少持不殺。	謂世現見造善者少、造惡者多，然於世間有情樂少苦多，可得如是世間諸有情類多行殺害、少持不殺。	033	It is said that in the world, those who do good are few, while those who do evil are many. However, among sentient beings in the world, there are few who are happy and many who are suffering. It is possible to find such a situation where among sentient beings in the world, many kill and few refrain from killing.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c28_16']	如其愛果殺害所招，則應世間樂多苦少。	如其愛果殺害所招，則應世間樂多苦少。	033	If desirable results were reaped from killing, then in the world there would be more happiness and less suffering.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0529c29_15']	既見不爾，是故定知非殺害因能招愛果。	既見不爾，是故定知非殺害因能招愛果。	033	Since we see that this is not the case, we therefore definitely know that killing does not lead to desirable results.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0530a01_19']	又見甘苦種子為因，如次能生甘苦二果，非相違故。	又見甘苦種子為因，如次能生甘苦二果，非相違故。	033	It is also seen that sweet and bitter seeds are causes, and they can respectively produce sweet and bitter fruits. This is not contradictory.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0530a03_3']	如是若造苦樂他業，如次應招自苦樂果，非此相違。	如是若造苦樂他業，如次應招自苦樂果，非此相違。	033	In the same way, if one creates suffering or happiness for others, one should respectively reap for oneself the results of suffering or happiness. This is not contradictory.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0530a05_1']	豈不世間毛蒲角𥯤，雖別體類而見相生，如是亦應苦樂他業如次能得自樂苦果。	豈不世間毛蒲角𥯤，雖別體類而見相生，如是亦應苦樂他業如次能得自樂苦果。	033	Don’t you see that in the world, even though reeds and so forth are different in kind, they still produce each other? In the same way, suffering and pleasure are produced by the actions of others.

Therefore the scripture only says:
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0531c10_15']	諸愛者表即是意業。	諸愛者表即是意業。	033	The indication of those who are attached is precisely mental action.

Although the originating cause of subsequent nonindicative form ceases, there are always primary elements of the same species that serve as its support. Therefore, nonindicative form continues to arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0531c18_10']	諸意業起必依於心，非後後時定有同類心相續起可意無表依止彼心多念相續，以心善等念念有殊。	諸意業起必依於心，非後後時定有同類心相續起可意無表依止彼心多念相續，以心善等念念有殊。	033	All mental activities must rely on the mind. It is not certain that the mind of the same species continues to arise subsequently. Nonindicative form of the mind must rely on the mind for many moments, because the mind, whether good, etc., is different from moment to moment.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0531c19_18']	設無表思同類續起，如何依止前心意業可隨後念異類心轉？	設無表思同類續起，如何依止前心意業可隨後念異類心轉？	033	Even if nonindicative form and volition continue in a series of the same species, how can it be said that the mental activity of the mind, which relies on the prior mind, continues to evolve in dependence on the subsequent mind, which is of a different species?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0531c20_17']	非有意業心不相應，故意業中亦無無表。	非有意業心不相應，故意業中亦無無表。	033	There is no mental activity that is not associated with the mind. Therefore, mental activity also has no nonindicative form.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0531c21_16']	是故唯有身語二業表無表性，其理善成。	是故唯有身語二業表無表性，其理善成。	033	Therefore, only the two kinds of bodily and vocal activity have the nature of both indicative and nonindicative form. This reasoning is well established.

['ZH_T29_1562_033:0533c23_6']	又譬喻者能起異端、曾所未聞解釋道理，執有為相是起及無，如是則應不成三數。	又譬喻者能起異端、曾所未聞解釋道理，執有為相是起及無，如是則應不成三數。	033	Moreover, the Sautrāntikas can give rise to heterodox views that have never been heard before, interpreting the principle in this way. They grasp that the characteristics of the conditioned are arising and non-existence. In this case, it should not form the three numbers.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0533c25_6']	謂有為法得體名起，盡及異相皆是體無，非後剎那與前有異，少有所因，如前已辯。	謂有為法得體名起，盡及異相皆是體無，非後剎那與前有異，少有所因，如前已辯。	033	That is to say, conditioned dharmas obtain the name arising when they obtain substance. The characteristics of exhaustion and change are all the non-existence of substance. It is not that the later moment is different from the previous. There is little cause, as explained above.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0533c26_6']	亦不可說有為法然起亦應同，成大過故。	亦不可說有為法然起亦應同，成大過故。	033	It cannot be said that conditioned dharmas are also thus and should be the same as arising, because it would lead to a great error.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0533c27_4']	謂諸行起亦應無因，以執有為法皆然故。	謂諸行起亦應無因，以執有為法皆然故。	033	That is to say, the arising of all conditioned activities should also have no cause, because it is grasped that all conditioned dharmas are thus.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0533c28_15']	是故彼異無體理成，則應以無為有為相，然不應許故，非滅不待因。	是故彼異無體理成，則應以無為有為相，然不應許故，非滅不待因。	033	Therefore, the principle of the non-existence of that difference is established. Then, it should be the characteristic of the conditioned by the unconditioned. However, since it is not accepted, cessation does not depend on a cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0533c29_5']	故我此中作如是釋：	故我此中作如是釋：	033	Therefore, I explain it like this in this context:
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0533c29_15']	現有法滅，不待客因。	現有法滅，不待客因。	033	The cessation of an existing dharma does not depend on a guest cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a01_7']	既不待客因，纔生已即滅。	既不待客因，纔生已即滅。	033	Since it does not depend on a guest cause, it ceases as soon as it arises.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a02_5']	若初不滅，後亦應然，以後與初主因等故。	若初不滅，後亦應然，以後與初主因等故。	033	If it did not cease at first, it should not cease later either, because the later [moment] is the same as the primary cause of the first [moment].
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a02_17']	既見後有盡，知前念念滅。	既見後有盡，知前念念滅。	033	Since we see the exhaustion of the later [moments], we know that the previous [moments] cease moment by moment.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a03_7']	若謂不然，世現見故。	若謂不然，世現見故。	033	If you say it is not so, it is because it is seen in the world.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a04_15']	謂世現見薪等先有，由後與火客因合時，便致滅無，不復見故。	謂世現見薪等先有，由後與火客因合時，便致滅無，不復見故。	033	That is to say, it is seen in the world that firewood and so forth exist first, and when they later combine with a guest cause such as fire, they are caused to cease and disappear, and are no longer seen.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a05_15']	定無餘量，過現量者，故非諸法滅皆不待客因。	定無餘量，過現量者，故非諸法滅皆不待客因。	033	Since there is definitely no other valid cognition that surpasses direct perception, the cessation of all dharmas does not depend on a guest cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a06_5']	豈不應如鈴聲燈焰。	豈不應如鈴聲燈焰。	033	Shouldn't it be like the sound of a bell or the flame of a lamp?🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a08_2']	如彼聲焰，雖離手風，剎那剎那由主因滅，而手風合餘不更生，後聲焰無不復可取。	如彼聲焰，雖離手風，剎那剎那由主因滅，而手風合餘不更生，後聲焰無不復可取。	033	Just as sound and flame, although separated from the hand and wind, are destroyed moment by moment by the dominant cause, and when the hand and wind come together, they do not arise again, and later sound and flame are no longer perceptible.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a10_1']	如是薪等由主滅因令念念滅，後與火合，便於滅位不為餘因，以後不生不復可取。	如是薪等由主滅因令念念滅，後與火合，便於滅位不為餘因，以後不生不復可取。	033	In the same way, firewood and so on are destroyed moment by moment by the dominant cause of destruction, and when later they come into contact with fire, they are not caused to be destroyed by anything else, and later they do not arise and are no longer perceptible.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a10_16']	是故此義，由比量成，非現量得。	是故此義，由比量成，非現量得。	033	Therefore, this meaning is established by inference, not by direct perception.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a11_1']	何謂比量？	何謂比量？	033	What is inference?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a11_11']	謂應如生，無無因故。	謂應如生，無無因故。	033	It means that it should be like arising, because there is no cause for non-existence.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a13_15']	以有為法不見不待客主二因而得生者，謂羯剌藍、牙牆識等，必待精血水土根等外緣資助然後得生。	以有為法不見不待客主二因而得生者，謂羯剌藍、牙牆識等，必待精血水土根等外緣資助然後得生。	033	For conditioned dharmas, one does not see or depend on the two causes of guest and host to obtain arising, referring to the kalala, sprout, wall, consciousness, etc., which must depend on external conditions such as semen, blood, water, soil, roots, etc. to assist before they can arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a15_5']	若待客因薪等滅者，則有為法應並如生，要待客因然後得滅。	若待客因薪等滅者，則有為法應並如生，要待客因然後得滅。	033	If the destruction of firewood and so on depends on the guest cause, then conditioned dharmas should be like arising, and must depend on the guest cause before they can be destroyed.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a16_15']	而世現見覺焰音聲，不待客因由主因滅，故一切行滅皆不待客因。	而世現見覺焰音聲，不待客因由主因滅，故一切行滅皆不待客因。	033	But in the world, we see that the flame of a lamp and the sound of a bell do not require external causes for their cessation, but rather cease by the exhaustion of their intrinsic causes. Therefore, the cessation of all conditioned dharmas does not require external causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a18_1']	是故諸有為，纔生已即滅，滅因常合故，剎那滅義成。	是故諸有為，纔生已即滅，滅因常合故，剎那滅義成。	033	Therefore, all conditioned dharmas, as soon as they are born, immediately cease, because the cause of cessation is always present, and thus the doctrine of momentariness is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a19_18']	有執覺聲前因後滅，有執燈焰滅亦住無為因，有執焰滅時由法非法力，彼皆非理。	有執覺聲前因後滅，有執燈焰滅亦住無為因，有執焰滅時由法非法力，彼皆非理。	033	Some hold that the cessation of consciousness and sound is preceded by a cause, while the cessation of the flame of a lamp is also caused by the exhaustion of its intrinsic cause. Some hold that the cessation of the flame is due to the power of dharmas and non-dharmas. All of these are unreasonable.

['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a20_13']	法未已生，無功能故。	法未已生，無功能故。	033	Because dharmas that have not yet arisen do not have the ability to cause cessation.

['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534a29_6']	又於一切有為法中皆可計度有此因故，應不更待火等滅因，是故不應執此因義。	又於一切有為法中皆可計度有此因故，應不更待火等滅因，是故不應執此因義。	033	Moreover, in all conditioned dharmas one can conceive of this reason, so one should not wait for the reason for cessation such as fire, etc. Therefore, one should not grasp the meaning of this reason.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b01_16']	又若薪等滅，火合為因，於熟變生中有下中上，應生因體即成滅因。	又若薪等滅，火合為因，於熟變生中有下中上，應生因體即成滅因。	033	Moreover, if the cessation of firewood, etc. is the reason for the combination with fire, then in the arising of cooked transformation there should be inferior, middling, and superior, and the essence of the reason for arising should become the reason for cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b02_2']	所以者何？	所以者何？	033	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b03_15']	謂由火合能令薪等有熟變生，中上熟生、下中熟滅，即生因體應成滅因。	謂由火合能令薪等有熟變生，中上熟生、下中熟滅，即生因體應成滅因。	033	This is because due to the combination with fire, it can cause firewood, etc. to have the arising of cooked transformation. The superior cooked transformation arises, and the inferior and middling cooked transformation ceases. The essence of the reason for arising should become the reason for cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b04_13']	然理不應因彼此有，即復因彼此法成無。	然理不應因彼此有，即復因彼此法成無。	033	However, it is not reasonable that due to this and that something exists, and then again due to this and that dharma becomes nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b06_10']	若謂焰生不停住故無斯過者，理亦不然，體類不殊，無決定理能為生滅二種因故。	若謂焰生不停住故無斯過者，理亦不然，體類不殊，無決定理能為生滅二種因故。	033	If you say that the flame is without this fault because it is born and does not endure, this is not reasonable, because the substance and species are not different, and there is no definite principle that can serve as a cause for both birth and cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b07_10']	且於火焰差別生中，容計能生能滅因異；	且於火焰差別生中，容計能生能滅因異；	033	Moreover, in the case of the differences in the birth of a flame, one may imagine that the causes of birth and cessation are different.

Just as the fire element gradually increases, in the same way it can cause the aggregate of water to gradually become a cause of a later state of weak water, because fire and water are mutually incompatible.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b13_6']	乃至最後位，更不能生後，是名火合於中所作。	乃至最後位，更不能生後，是名火合於中所作。	033	Finally, in the last state, it can no longer produce a later state. This is called the function of fire in this case.
['ZH_T29_1562_033:0534b14_5']	故諸法滅不待客因，但由主因令諸法滅。	故諸法滅不待客因，但由主因令諸法滅。	033	Therefore the cessation of dharmas does not depend on guest causes. It is only due to the host cause that dharmas cease.
