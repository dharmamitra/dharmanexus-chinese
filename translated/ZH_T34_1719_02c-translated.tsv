In this sutra, it is said that the general description of the past refers to the repeated description of the emergence of the Dharma, and the emitting of light refers to the gradual and sudden illumination. Only the flowers and ground specifically represent this sutra, but the intention is secret and not yet revealed. Entering concentration means that the meaning includes both opening and closing. The joy of the assembly is different from the past, and the past is different from the present. The thought of doubt is both based on the past and present, but still uncertain about the future. Answering questions means broadly describing the three similarities and comprehensively including the entire period. Since the meaning of the sutra is far-reaching, the preface is also unusual. Therefore, other sutras simply give rise to the event.

This refers to the time before the six auspicious signs appeared, when the assembly first surrounded the Buddha, just before he was about to expound the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0188c15_15']	若云眾集時者，不可云眾集時眾繞，如〈方便品〉初，即指文殊答問竟時，不可云佛從三昧起時；	若云眾集時者，不可云眾集時眾繞，如〈方便品〉初，即指文殊答問竟時，不可云佛從三昧起時；	02c	If it is said that the assembly gathered at that time, it cannot be said that the assembly gathered at the time of the assembly's surrounding. Like the beginning of the chapter on skillful means, it refers to the time after Mañjuśrī had finished answering questions. It cannot be said that it was when the Buddha arose from samādhi.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0188c16_18']	從三昧起，如云爾後爾乃等，皆是爾時之後。	從三昧起，如云爾後爾乃等，皆是爾時之後。	02c	Arising from samādhi is like saying after that, then and so on. All of these are after that time.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0188c19_2']	若集眾竟，可云爾乃說《無量義》，故知別論即是欲說《無量義》時，通論可指佛未定起之時。	若集眾竟，可云爾乃說《無量義》，故知別論即是欲說《無量義》時，通論可指佛未定起之時。	02c	If the assembly had gathered, it could be said that then he expounded the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings. Therefore, it is known that the separate discussion is precisely the time when he was about to expound the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, and the general discussion can refer to the time before the Buddha had arisen from his samādhi.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0188c20_6']	初則四眾圍繞乃至雨華地動，故云「是時天雨」等也。	初則四眾圍繞乃至雨華地動，故云「是時天雨」等也。	02c	First, the four assemblies surrounded him, and then there was rain, earth-shaking, and so on. Therefore, it says at that time, the heavens rained and so on.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0188c26_8']	言「生起」者，從前向後則前生而後起，從後向前則後生而前起，即答生由於問起，亦可云答起由於問生，乃至集眾亦爾。	言「生起」者，從前向後則前生而後起，從後向前則後生而前起，即答生由於問起，亦可云答起由於問生，乃至集眾亦爾。	02c	As for arising, from the front to the back, then the front arises and the back arises, from the back to the front, then the back arises and the front arises. It is the answer arising due to the question arising, or it can be said that the answer arises due to the question arising, and so on, the gathering of the assembly is also like this.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0188c29_7']	若依今家應表十一。	若依今家應表十一。	02c	If it is based on the present family, it should illustrate the eleven.

Therefore, it is known that from beginning to end, the master's purpose is that the person is the world, many people gather together until now the same;
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189a06_2']	理一是第一義，此名最順六瑞一一無不表中；	理一是第一義，此名最順六瑞一一無不表中；	02c	The principle is the ultimate truth, this name is the most in accord with the six auspicious signs, each and every one does not represent the middle;

Only with this expression can it be brought forth. Going against and following have a reason.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189a12_11']	若不爾者，何大乘經不集眾放光雨華動地，但無生於大疑，請答不必妙德，答問不引三同。	若不爾者，何大乘經不集眾放光雨華動地，但無生於大疑，請答不必妙德，答問不引三同。	02c	If it were not so, what Mahayana sutra does not gather the assembly, emit light, rain flowers, and shake the earth? But there is no great doubt, and the request for an answer does not necessarily require Subhūti. The question is not drawn from the three similarities.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189a18_16']	今雖未正說，但因疑請問答而後知，則使華地之前既說定異常，說定之前眾不孤集，雖曾聞《無量義》，既定不散知向聞未卒，故知華地之後定起所說不輕，以前後準中應華地亦異，由是聞法表一乘人，人由現瑞表一乘理，為顯斯理生疑問答，教行斯在人理宛然。	今雖未正說，但因疑請問答而後知，則使華地之前既說定異常，說定之前眾不孤集，雖曾聞《無量義》，既定不散知向聞未卒，故知華地之後定起所說不輕，以前後準中應華地亦異，由是聞法表一乘人，人由現瑞表一乘理，為顯斯理生疑問答，教行斯在人理宛然。	02c	Although it is not yet being directly spoken of now, but because of the doubt and request for explanation, the answer will be known later. This causes the extraordinary samādhi to be spoken of before the flowers and earth. Before the samādhi, the assembly is not gathered in vain. Although the Immeasurable Meaning has already been heard, since the samādhi does not disperse, it is known that what was heard before is not yet finished. Therefore, it is known that after the flowers and earth, the samādhi will give rise to what is spoken of. Judging from the beginning and end, the flowers and earth should also be extraordinary. Therefore, hearing the Dharma expresses the person of the One Vehicle. The person is expressed by the auspicious signs of the One Vehicle principle. In order to manifest this principle, there are questions and answers. The teaching and practice are present, and the person and principle are distinct.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189a21_12']	又由瑞中說開經表合教，入合定表中行，放中光表中理，雨中華表中位，中地動中惑除，總成人一，良有以也。	又由瑞中說開經表合教，入合定表中行，放中光表中理，雨中華表中位，中地動中惑除，總成人一，良有以也。	02c	Moreover, the auspicious signs in the sutra explain the opening of the sutra to reveal the teaching, entering into the concentration reveals the middle practice, emitting light from the middle reveals the middle principle, raining down flowers reveals the middle stage, the shaking of the earth removes the middle delusions, and altogether forms one person, which is indeed reasonable.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189a24_7']	故天表第一義天，地表實相之地，雖並有表兆而時眾莫測，故縱聞開經尚不知開本表於合，況復能知定理等耶？	故天表第一義天，地表實相之地，雖並有表兆而時眾莫測，故縱聞開經尚不知開本表於合，況復能知定理等耶？	02c	Therefore, the heavens represent the ultimate truth, and the earth represents the true reality. Although they both have signs, the assembly at that time did not understand, so even if they heard the opening of the sutra, they still did not know that the opening originally revealed the closing. How much less could they understand the principle of concentration and so forth?
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189a28_1']	故待文殊引往，方知化道不殊，故知生疑本為立行，疑決行稱引古教同，乃知今佛方說教一，而令時會成一乘人，如是乃可為今經由漸，作顯實先萌。	故待文殊引往，方知化道不殊，故知生疑本為立行，疑決行稱引古教同，乃知今佛方說教一，而令時會成一乘人，如是乃可為今經由漸，作顯實先萌。	02c	Therefore, waiting for Manjushri to bring up the past, they only then knew that the way of transformation is not different. Therefore, we know that the doubt arose in order to establish practice. When the doubt is resolved and the practice is accomplished, the ancient teaching is brought up and the same. Only then do we know that the present Buddha is just expounding the oneness of the teaching, and causing the assembly to become people of the One Vehicle. In this way, it can be the gradual cause for this sutra, and the prior sprout for revealing the true meaning.

In the end, it would still not be manifested. This is still only an explanation based on causes and conditions.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189b02_16']	約教中應明施開廢會，方顯序中所表，而云「非藏」等者，且約廢權故並云非，先廢後開理數然耳。	約教中應明施開廢會，方顯序中所表，而云「非藏」等者，且約廢權故並云非，先廢後開理數然耳。	02c	In the doctrinal classification, it should clarify the opening, abolishing, and unifying of giving, in order to reveal what is expressed in the preface. However, it says not the canon and so on, just because the provisional is abolished. It is only natural that it is abolished first and then opened.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189b03_17']	故歷教簡三尚未名一，若開顯已無非經王。	故歷教簡三尚未名一，若開顯已無非經王。	02c	Therefore, the three are classified according to the teachings, and it is not yet called one. If the opening and revealing are completed, there is nothing that is not the king of sūtras.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0189b04_9']	又開已唯圓故云非也。	又開已唯圓故云非也。	02c	Moreover, since the opening is only the perfect, it is said to be not so.

It is necessary to reach the chapter on life span, but it can also be pre-shown. Therefore, it is known that this preface reveals the four traces and secretly shows the four origins. The long-established is not beyond these four, so the near and distant are different, but the principle of the four and one is the same.

However, it is necessary to briefly know and show it like this.

Now it is necessary to say that the inciting cause, the original and trace, the doctrinal interpretation, and the dependent origination are the four sequential methods. Although the capacity can be aroused, it must rely on a prior guide. When the guided capacity is aroused, the responsive and circumstantial support it.

It can be verified that this preface is not yet common to the original, although it is crowned at the beginning of the sutra because it is originally separate. However, the arousing in both places is both in Maitreya.

The great skillful means benefits the sages and ordinary beings. The Tathāgata's three insights speak of the past seeds, therefore, he first attained enlightenment and protected those suffering in the hells. In the Vaipulya and Prajñā[pāramitā] sūtras, he considered the capacity of those [beings] to be born. Therefore, in this sūtra, he first briefly taught and then extensively taught. The three periods of time fully encompass all. Up to the chapter on the origin, one attains the stage of being free from defilements. Not missing a single hair, it accords with one's past causes.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190b27_6']	此舉實行者尚有影響之儀，況法身古佛垂形助化，故知四眾如輕病者差，八部如重病者差，輕重俱有權實影響。	此舉實行者尚有影響之儀，況法身古佛垂形助化，故知四眾如輕病者差，八部如重病者差，輕重俱有權實影響。	02c	Here, even the actual practitioners still have the demeanor of being reflections and echoes, let alone the ancient Buddhy of the Dharma-body who manifests to assist in transforming beings. Therefore, know that the fourfold assembly is like a patient with a mild illness recovering, and the eight groups of beings are like a patient with a serious illness recovering.

Powerless distinguishes from the initiating, and virtue not distinguishes from the reflections and echoes. But surpassing clarifies that it is not the primary audience.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c04_8']	凡發起眾皆具二義：	凡發起眾皆具二義：	02c	In general, the initiating assembly all has two meanings:

Adorning and transforming affairs glorify the host's function, therefore those with karmic affinity do not have it, therefore it says powerless and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c10_18']	又鎮以肅之，嚴以伏之，既肅既伏化道可行，故云「之用」。	又鎮以肅之，嚴以伏之，既肅既伏化道可行，故云「之用」。	02c	Moreover, firmness is to awe, adornment is to subdue. Since they are awed and subdued, the way of transformation can be practiced, therefore it says the use.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c11_19']	故云「德非」也。	故云「德非」也。	02c	Therefore it says virtue is not.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c15_7']	「覆漏」等者，覆字入聲，無聞慧故如器現覆，闕思慧故如器已漏，無修慧故如器污雜，如器雖仰而全，以污雜故為用者棄，故總結云「三慧不生」。	「覆漏」等者，覆字入聲，無聞慧故如器現覆，闕思慧故如器已漏，無修慧故如器污雜，如器雖仰而全，以污雜故為用者棄，故總結云「三慧不生」。	02c	Covered and leaking - the character fu is pronounced as ru. Because there is no hearing wisdom, it is like a vessel that is covered. Because of lacking thinking wisdom, it is like a vessel that is leaking. Because of lacking cultivation wisdom, it is like a vessel that is defiled and mixed. Although the vessel is held up, it is discarded by those who use it because it is defiled and mixed. Therefore, it is concluded that the three wisdoms do not arise.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c16_10']	「現世」等者，現雖得聞而不名慧，聞慧尚無思修安有？	「現世」等者，現雖得聞而不名慧，聞慧尚無思修安有？	02c	In the present world - although one may hear [the Dharma] in the present, it is not called wisdom. If there is no hearing wisdom, how could there be thinking and cultivation wisdom?

Therefore, although those who left do not have the three wisdoms, they have received the seeds in their nature and can be considered to have the pearl tied to their clothes. Therefore, it is known that they also do not have the benefit of the world in the stage of contemplation and practice. Therefore, it is said that there is no benefit of the four siddhāntas.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c20_18']	準此分位，四悉俱得名為當機，故五品已來世界益也；	準此分位，四悉俱得名為當機，故五品已來世界益也；	02c	Based on this stage, the four siddhāntas are all called the right audience. Therefore, the benefit of the world is from the five categories up to the five thousand people who left.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c21_10']	六根已來為人對治益也；	六根已來為人對治益也；	02c	The benefit of the person and the counteractive [teaching] is from the six faculties up to the five thousand people who left.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0190c25_13']	然聞略說則有過於一句一偈，是則不論聞之多少，但未入品俱名結緣，故五品前無復三慧、四悉益也。	然聞略說則有過於一句一偈，是則不論聞之多少，但未入品俱名結緣，故五品前無復三慧、四悉益也。	02c	However, hearing a brief explanation is more than a single verse or a single line. Whether one hears much or little, as long as one has not yet entered the ranks, one is still considered to have formed a karmic connection. Therefore, before the five ranks, there is no more of the three wisdoms or the four benefits of the four siddhāntas.

The generality is in the five ranks, and the particularity is in the initial abode. Therefore, the words to be saved also have generality and particularity. This is the generality and particularity of the highest truth.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191a01_4']	是則雖復四悉義通，終成結緣位別。	是則雖復四悉義通，終成結緣位別。	02c	This means that although the four siddhāntas have general meaning, they ultimately form a particular stage of karmic connection.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191a01_16']	「但作」下正示結緣眾相。	「但作」下正示結緣眾相。	02c	But to act... shows the characteristics of the audience who have formed a karmic connection.

Although the nuns do not have the text of requesting the Dharma, the text below also has the appearance of requesting the prophecy. However, although the two lay assemblies do not have the main text, according to the analogy, they should have it. Since they have arrived at the assembly, they must be led by the provisional ones.

Therefore, it is known that simply saying bhikṣus and the other four do not fully encompass them. Those who say there is no text have a deep lack of understanding.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191a13_6']	觀心明位取五品為結緣者，且約觀行為言，故以名字觀行而為結緣，以當機中初住即入影響故也。	觀心明位取五品為結緣者，且約觀行為言，故以名字觀行而為結緣，以當機中初住即入影響故也。	02c	As for the view of the mind's stages taking the five ranks as those who form affinities, it is just about the practice of contemplation, so it takes the names and practices of contemplation as forming affinities, because in the present assembly the initial abode immediately enters the retinue.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191a15_2']	應知初住具有二義，若舊入者唯名影響，乃至聞經超入後位意亦如是。	應知初住具有二義，若舊入者唯名影響，乃至聞經超入後位意亦如是。	02c	One should know that the initial abode has two meanings. If it is the old entry, it is only called the retinue, and even hearing the sūtra surpasses and enters the later stage, the meaning is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191a16_10']	若新入者得是當機亦是影響及以發起，即如發誓弘經之徒。	若新入者得是當機亦是影響及以發起，即如發誓弘經之徒。	02c	If it is the new entry, it obtains this present assembly and is also the retinue and the instigator, which is just like the group that vows to propagate the sūtra.

At this stage, they are all suitable to be this fourfold assembly.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191b26_11']	云「未彰」者，光宅雖即彼此同六，皆云三雙全無所表，故知動靜之言太淺。	云「未彰」者，光宅雖即彼此同六，皆云三雙全無所表，故知動靜之言太淺。	02c	It says not yet manifested because although Guangzhai immediately agrees with the six, they all say that the three pairs have nothing to indicate. Therefore, it is known that the words movement and stillness are too shallow.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191b27_17']	上下之語既彰，況內懷歡喜非唯覩光，是故今不存其立稱。	上下之語既彰，況內懷歡喜非唯覩光，是故今不存其立稱。	02c	The words above and below are already manifested, let alone inwardly rejoicing. It is not only seeing the light, therefore, now it does not retain its established name.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191b28_9']	況度人觀理何教無之？	況度人觀理何教無之？	02c	Let alone crossing over people and contemplating principles, what teaching does not have this?
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c01_1']	所以吉相預報令知當善，故先示奇特警悟物情，名為表報。	所以吉相預報令知當善，故先示奇特警悟物情，名為表報。	02c	Therefore, auspicious signs are reported in advance to let people know what is to come, so extraordinary things are shown first to alert people's feelings, called preliminary report.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c01_13']	但眾既未了，知決在文殊。	但眾既未了，知決在文殊。	02c	But since the assembly is still not clear, knowing is definitely in Manjushri.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c03_11']	文殊決已，知定起所說不出一多相即，從因至果感應道交，故以三雙而先表報。	文殊決已，知定起所說不出一多相即，從因至果感應道交，故以三雙而先表報。	02c	Once Manjushri has decided, knowing that the teaching will not go beyond the identity of one and many, from cause to effect, with the path of response, therefore using three pairs to first report.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c05_5']	既列教首教須殊常，上下等言事則易了，何須文殊靳固彌勒慇懃耶？	既列教首教須殊常，上下等言事則易了，何須文殊靳固彌勒慇懃耶？	02c	Since the teaching leader is listed, the teaching must be extraordinary. The words equal above and below make the matter easy to understand, so why is Manjushri stingy and Maitreya earnest?
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c05_17']	三「今明」下正釋，中三：	三「今明」下正釋，中三：	02c	Third, below now clarifying, the main explanation, in three parts:

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c08_5']	初文者，六中除說法餘五同時，雖復異同共顯一致。	初文者，六中除說法餘五同時，雖復異同共顯一致。	02c	In the first text, among the six, excluding the Dharma talk, the other five are simultaneous. Although they are different, they share the same meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c09_15']	然於六中雖前二後二正為時眾，以中二為表，正在因果故也。	然於六中雖前二後二正為時眾，以中二為表，正在因果故也。	02c	Although the first two and the last two of the six are directly for the assembly at that time, the middle two are the symbols, because they are directly in cause and effect.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c12_9']	所以華表真因、地兼分果，說且顯露從多、定乃密意從處，圓機當發圓應照之，故知六瑞並異諸經，不同光宅。	所以華表真因、地兼分果，說且顯露從多、定乃密意從處，圓機當發圓應照之，故知六瑞並異諸經，不同光宅。	02c	The reason for this is that the flowers symbolize the true cause, and the earth also includes the divided fruition. The teaching is mainly revealed and mostly about the many, while the samādhi is secretly intended and based on the place. The perfect opportunity should give rise to the perfect response, which illuminates it. Therefore, it is known that the six auspicious signs are all different from those of other sūtras, and are not the same as the Huayan school.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c13_12']	次明同異中先引文明同，「人情分別」去辨異。	次明同異中先引文明同，「人情分別」去辨異。	02c	Next, in clarifying the similarities and differences, first cite the text to show the similarities, and then distinguish the differences from the discrimination of human emotions.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c15_11']	雖以異為相、表報為瑞，異瑞之相本報妙理，從同義強復有文據，故順人情未為盡理。	雖以異為相、表報為瑞，異瑞之相本報妙理，從同義強復有文據，故順人情未為盡理。	02c	Although using differences as the characteristics and retribution as the auspicious signs, the characteristics of the different auspicious signs are based on the wondrous principle of retribution. Following the meaning of similarity is stronger and has textual evidence, so following human emotions is not yet the complete principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c16_2']	「玄」者黑色，義同幽也。	「玄」者黑色，義同幽也。	02c	Xuan means black, and the meaning is the same as profound.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c16_9']	「頤」即深也。	「頤」即深也。	02c	Yi means deep.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c18_2']	「說之」等者，諸佛出世本為佛乘，四十餘年抑之在懷，圓音將興慮不尊重。	「說之」等者，諸佛出世本為佛乘，四十餘年抑之在懷，圓音將興慮不尊重。	02c	Speaking of and so on, the Buddhas appear in the world for the sake of the Buddha vehicle. For more than forty years, they have suppressed it in their minds. The perfect sound is about to arise, but they worry about not being respected.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c19_3']	又復以瑞而擡掣之，令欽渴信生、疑去解明。	又復以瑞而擡掣之，令欽渴信生、疑去解明。	02c	Moreover, it raises and lifts it up with auspicious signs, causing people to give rise to faith and eliminate doubts and gain understanding.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c20_13']	「表報十妙」者，若準前文秖應表報四一而已，以四一文略順光宅。	「表報十妙」者，若準前文秖應表報四一而已，以四一文略順光宅。	02c	As for illustrating and repaying the ten marvels, if following the previous text, it should only illustrate and repay the four ones, because the text on the four ones is brief and in accordance with Guangzhai.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c22_8']	若準今文廣則無量略則但十，極略秖可云表一乘，今雖云略乃成處中。	若準今文廣則無量略則但十，極略秖可云表一乘，今雖云略乃成處中。	02c	If following the present text, the extensive is immeasurable, and the brief is only ten. The most brief can only be said to illustrate the One Vehicle. Although it is said to be brief here, it becomes a middle way.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c25_1']	又十妙者，此經既以妙報釋瑞，妙義既十，六之所表道理應然，故近則表迹、遠表於本，具如《玄》文開合者是。	又十妙者，此經既以妙報釋瑞，妙義既十，六之所表道理應然，故近則表迹、遠表於本，具如《玄》文開合者是。	02c	Moreover, as for the ten marvels, since this sutra explains auspicious signs with marvelous rewards, since the marvelous meanings are ten, the principles illustrated by the six should be the same. Therefore, it is close to illustrating the traces and far to illustrating the origin, as is the case with the opening and closing in the Profound Text.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0191c25_16']	若且表迹亦如《玄》文引經六瑞。	若且表迹亦如《玄》文引經六瑞。	02c	If it is just illustrating the traces, it is also as the Profound Text quotes the sutra's six auspicious signs.

Emitting light from the eyebrows indicates the wondrous wisdom. Entering into samādhi indicates the wondrous practice. The heavens raining down four kinds of flowers indicates the wondrous stage. Sandalwood-scented breezes indicate the wondrous vehicle. The fourfold assembly having doubts indicates the wondrous opportunity. Seeing the eight thousand lands indicates the wondrous response. Offerings indicate the wondrous response and accord.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a05_1']	地動表神通妙，天鼓表說法妙，眾喜表眷屬妙，修行表利益妙。	地動表神通妙，天鼓表說法妙，眾喜表眷屬妙，修行表利益妙。	02c	The ground shaking indicates the wondrous spiritual powers. Heavenly drums indicate the wondrous Dharma teaching. The assembly rejoicing indicates the wondrous retinue. Cultivation and practice indicate the wondrous benefits.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a06_15']	今文不列他土文者，此土自足故也。	今文不列他土文者，此土自足故也。	02c	The present text does not list the other lands because this land is sufficient in itself.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a08_7']	凡諸取文皆有通別，況香風地淨但是開合，至下釋文更有料簡。	凡諸取文皆有通別，況香風地淨但是開合，至下釋文更有料簡。	02c	All the texts taken have both general and specific meanings, especially since the sandalwood-scented breezes and the pure ground are merely an opening and closing. In the following explanation of the text, there will be further distinctions.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a12_2']	又他土中上聖下凡義同感應，人法復與說法義同，唯始終中終同應息，菩薩行行復同因果，故行行文寬總攝於漸，凡所表語意並含弘，是故下文多番釋之。	又他土中上聖下凡義同感應，人法復與說法義同，唯始終中終同應息，菩薩行行復同因果，故行行文寬總攝於漸，凡所表語意並含弘，是故下文多番釋之。	02c	Moreover, in other lands, the superior sages and inferior ordinary beings have the same responsive manifestations, the people and Dharma are also the same as the Dharma that is taught, only the beginning and end are the same as the cessation of response. The bodhisattvas' practices are also the same as cause and effect, therefore the text on practicing the Way is broad and comprehensively includes the gradual. All the figurative words and meanings are vast, therefore the text below has many explanations.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a13_15']	古來諸釋都無此意，光等徒施浪疑虛答，狀若炫燿時眾，何殊精魅外通。	古來諸釋都無此意，光等徒施浪疑虛答，狀若炫燿時眾，何殊精魅外通。	02c	Ancient commentators all lack this meaning, the vain offerings of light and others, vain doubts and empty answers, appear as if dazzling the assembly, how is it different from a refined ghost with external abilities?
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a17_11']	故一家釋瑞必有所表，是則大事大人作大感動，大機大益顯於大理，須大眷屬以輔大會，俱感大時大運成熟，自非靈山共稟、此世親承，焉能契之曷有測之。	故一家釋瑞必有所表，是則大事大人作大感動，大機大益顯於大理，須大眷屬以輔大會，俱感大時大運成熟，自非靈山共稟、此世親承，焉能契之曷有測之。	02c	Therefore, the one family's explanation of auspicious signs must have something they represent. This is then the great matter, the great person, creating great movement, the great opportunity, the great benefit, manifesting the great principle, requiring the great retinue to assist the great assembly, all responding to the great time, the great fortune maturing. If it were not for the spiritual mountain sharing the same understanding, this world personally receiving the transmission, how could it accord with it, how could there be a way to fathom it?

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a23_18']	既引彼經以此莊之，令成今妙，以彼善戒但從自行因果，故無餘五，法大境也。	既引彼經以此莊之，令成今妙，以彼善戒但從自行因果，故無餘五，法大境也。	02c	Since it quotes that sutra to adorn this, causing it to become the present wonder, because that good precepts only follow the causes and effects of one's own practice, there are no other five, with the Dharma being the great realm.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192a25_1']	通是教法，別以十二部中毘佛略部，是方等理。	通是教法，別以十二部中毘佛略部，是方等理。	02c	In general, it is the Dharma of teaching, specifically, it is the Vimalakirti Sutra among the twelve divisions, which is the principle of the vaipulya.

Therefore, there are only the first five, which must also include the latter five. Moreover, the names of cause and effect are the same, but the principles are still different. The distinctions between including and excluding should be understood.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192b01_4']	況復三祇義涉三藏，數有大小故使之然。	況復三祇義涉三藏，數有大小故使之然。	02c	Moreover, the meaning of three asaṃkhyeya kalpas is related to the Tripiṭaka, and the number has large and small, which causes it to be so.

Within this, first stating what they have established, next, from If so below, the current text's objection. The signlessness of the Prajnaparamita and Vimalakirti sutras is not the preface, so how can the signlessness of the Immeasurable Meanings be used as the preface?
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192b10_19']	次救意者，五時相生次第別故，雖俱無相前後有殊，二經之後方《無量義》，《無量義》後方是《法華》，故唯《無量》為《法華》序，餘二遠故序義不成。	次救意者，五時相生次第別故，雖俱無相前後有殊，二經之後方《無量義》，《無量義》後方是《法華》，故唯《無量》為《法華》序，餘二遠故序義不成。	02c	Next, the meaning of the rescue is: the five periods give rise to each other in a different sequence. Although they are both signless, there is a difference between before and after. After the two sutras comes the Immeasurable Meanings, and after the Immeasurable Meanings comes the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, only the Immeasurable Meanings is the preface to the Lotus Sutra, and the other two are distant, so the meaning of the preface is not established.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0192b13_2']	「若爾」下更難者，始自華嚴，後後教起以至法華，此則通途，前經生後乃成次第，展轉為序別義不成。	「若爾」下更難者，始自華嚴，後後教起以至法華，此則通途，前經生後乃成次第，展轉為序別義不成。	02c	If so below, further objection. Beginning with the Flower Ornament Sutra, each subsequent teaching arises up to the Lotus Sutra. This is the general course. The previous sutra giving rise to the later establishes the sequence. The successive prefaces have a different meaning that is not established.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193b16_10']	例如漸頓亦具能所，是則凡一實理皆諸教流出，《無量義》中述其意耳。	例如漸頓亦具能所，是則凡一實理皆諸教流出，《無量義》中述其意耳。	02c	For example, gradual and sudden also have the able and the so, then every one true principle all flows out from the teachings, it is just the meaning described in the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193b18_17']	故三乘中二乘含四、菩薩兼三，若作三四義通四教如向所對，若作三四並是所生，則菩薩及佛但在三教。	故三乘中二乘含四、菩薩兼三，若作三四義通四教如向所對，若作三四並是所生，則菩薩及佛但在三教。	02c	Therefore, within the three vehicles, the two vehicles contain four, and the bodhisattvas also have three. If made into four or three, the meaning extends to the four teachings as opposed above. If made into four or three, they are all that which is produced, then the bodhisattvas and buddhas are only in the three teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193b20_15']	從教判權，《玄》文復以四佛為四果者，則圓佛為一而生權三，能所相對故云四佛。	從教判權，《玄》文復以四佛為四果者，則圓佛為一而生權三，能所相對故云四佛。	02c	From the teachings, the provisional is judged. The Xuanwen also uses the four buddhas as the four fruits. Then the perfect buddha is one, producing the provisional three. Because the able and the so are opposed, it is said there are four buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193b22_4']	是則菩薩名通於義無失，故於獨一生於兼一，思之可見。	是則菩薩名通於義無失，故於獨一生於兼一，思之可見。	02c	This is then the name bodhisattva is common, but the meaning is not lost. Therefore, in the solitary one produces, in the combined one produces, thinking on it can be seen.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193b25_8']	「此等」下更結所生以示能生，能生義處《法華》別名，所生無量為《法華》序，故序中一名義兼兩向，然應知從一以出無量，雖舉能出通皆屬序。	「此等」下更結所生以示能生，能生義處《法華》別名，所生無量為《法華》序，故序中一名義兼兩向，然應知從一以出無量，雖舉能出通皆屬序。	02c	These and below further concludes what is produced to show what produces. The place of the meaning of what produces is the specific name of the Lotus Sutra, and what is produced is immeasurable, which is the preface of the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, the name and meaning in the preface are both directed towards two aspects. However, it should be known that although the immeasurable is produced from one, even if the ability to produce is mentioned, it all belongs to the preface.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193b28_10']	若無量入一雖涉所生通皆屬正，故義處一法亦成兩向，出生之義處屬序，收會之義處屬正，即從「一義處」已下兩句文，是其兩意。	若無量入一雖涉所生通皆屬正，故義處一法亦成兩向，出生之義處屬序，收會之義處屬正，即從「一義處」已下兩句文，是其兩意。	02c	If the immeasurable enters one, although it involves what is produced, it all belongs to the main part. Therefore, the meaning of the one principle also forms two aspects. The meaning of producing belongs to the preface, and the meaning of gathering belongs to the main part. The two sentences below one principle are the two meanings.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193b29_2']	故佛入義處義兼二途。	故佛入義處義兼二途。	02c	Therefore, the Buddha entering the principle also encompasses both paths.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c02_6']	「譬」者，序如下從一出多，正如除從多歸一，故知昔教赴機益物如用錢市物，而皆未知其大數。	「譬」者，序如下從一出多，正如除從多歸一，故知昔教赴機益物如用錢市物，而皆未知其大數。	02c	Simile means that below the preface, producing many from one is just like eliminating and returning many to one. Therefore, it is known that the teachings of the past accord with the capacities of beings and benefit them, like using money to buy goods, but they all do not yet know the great number.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c02_14']	「從一」下合喻。	「從一」下合喻。	02c	From one below combines the simile.

The ability to give rise does not contradict the treatise, and the arising does not contradict the sutra. It only relies on the two interpretations, and the principle of sutra and treatise exists.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c05_1']	消釋既爾得意者何？	消釋既爾得意者何？	02c	If the interpretation is like this, what is the meaning of understanding?

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c07_1']	若也專能，何殊生等及昔一圓？	若也專能，何殊生等及昔一圓？	02c	If it is only the ability, how is it different from giving rise and the one perfect teaching of the past?

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c10_18']	若專序者，則《法華》已前非但未論會多歸一，亦未曾說從一出多，故《無量義》唯今經序。	若專序者，則《法華》已前非但未論會多歸一，亦未曾說從一出多，故《無量義》唯今經序。	02c	If it is only the preface, then before the Lotus Sutra, not only was the merging of many into one not discussed, but the arising of one and the arising of many had never been spoken of. Therefore, the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings is only the preface to the present sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c11_16']	「復次」下，以前後二文對破古者，此非正破。	「復次」下，以前後二文對破古者，此非正破。	02c	Furthermore and below, the previous and following two texts are used to refute the ancients. This is not the correct refutation.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c15_2']	《無量義經》在《法華》前，《普賢觀經》在《法華》後，序結並常，中何容別？	《無量義經》在《法華》前，《普賢觀經》在《法華》後，序結並常，中何容別？	02c	The Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings is before the Lotus Sutra, and the Sutra of Universal Worthy's Contemplation is after the Lotus Sutra. The prefaces and conclusions are both eternal. How could the middle be different?

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c19_16']	此明法身性離諸非，故總舉百，然絕四離百之語猶通淺深，節節比之。	此明法身性離諸非，故總舉百，然絕四離百之語猶通淺深，節節比之。	02c	This clarifies that the nature of the Dharma body is free from all negations, so it generally mentions a hundred. However, the phrases beyond four and free from a hundred are still somewhat vague, and should be compared at each stage.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c20_3']	今應從深。	今應從深。	02c	Now, it should follow the profound meaning.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c24_3']	「釋迦牟尼名毘盧遮那，遍一切處，其佛住處名常寂光，常波羅蜜所攝成處，我波羅蜜所安立處，淨波羅蜜滅有相處，樂波羅蜜不住身心相處。	「釋迦牟尼名毘盧遮那，遍一切處，其佛住處名常寂光，常波羅蜜所攝成處，我波羅蜜所安立處，淨波羅蜜滅有相處，樂波羅蜜不住身心相處。	02c	The name Shakyamuni is also Vairocana, pervading everywhere. The abode of that Buddha is called the eternally quiescent light, accomplished through the perfection of permanence, established through the perfection of self, the perfection of purity eliminates the characteristics of existence, and the perfection of bliss does not abide in the characteristics of body and mind.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0193c26_4']	」既以此四成身成土，爾前理合身常土常，故大師追括五時悉皆有結，具如《玄》文。	」既以此四成身成土，爾前理合身常土常，故大師追括五時悉皆有結，具如《玄》文。	02c	Since the body and land are accomplished through these four, the body should always be permanent and the land should always be permanent. Therefore, the Great Master retrospectively summarizes the five periods as all having conclusions, as fully explained in the Profound Text.

Others indiscriminately cite it as an analogy, saying that it is similar to the explanation of permanence in the preface to the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, which is actually impermanence, therefore using the Lotus Sūtra as an analogy to that sūtra, it should be that the preface to the Lotus Sūtra should explain permanence as impermanence.

['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0194a08_5']	今亦反難意者，若以《法華》例於《淨名》，亦應以《涅槃》例於《淨名》，則《涅槃》序常正無常也。	今亦反難意者，若以《法華》例於《淨名》，亦應以《涅槃》例於《淨名》，則《涅槃》序常正無常也。	02c	Now, the meaning of the counter-argument is: if using the Lotus Sūtra as an analogy to the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, it should also use the Nirvāṇa Sūtra as an analogy to the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, then the preface to the Nirvāṇa Sūtra should explain permanence as impermanence.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0194a10_4']	故知秖可以《淨名》例於《涅槃》，序正俱常，汝自不了《淨名》宗體，謂正無常而為例耳。	故知秖可以《淨名》例於《涅槃》，序正俱常，汝自不了《淨名》宗體，謂正無常而為例耳。	02c	Therefore, we know that we can only use the Vimalakīrti Sūtra to illustrate the Nirvana Sūtra, with both the introduction and main part being permanent. You yourself do not understand the essence of the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, and take the main part as impermanent as an example.
['ZH_T34_1719_02c:0194a11_11']	當知《淨名》亦序正並常，故〈問疾品〉中明第一義空，空即常也。	當知《淨名》亦序正並常，故〈問疾品〉中明第一義空，空即常也。	02c	You should know that the Vimalakīrti Sūtra also has both the introduction and main part being permanent. Therefore, in the Chapter on Asking about Illness, it clarifies the ultimate truth, which is emptiness, and emptiness is permanence.

The Chapter on the Buddha of Fragrant Accumulation clarifies the essence of fragrant food as being permanent, and the bodhisattva practices returning to the fundamental principle of permanence. Therefore, we know that the main part from beginning to end is all permanent.

In the introduction of this sutra, although permanence is mentioned, it is not yet clear how it is accomplished. In the main part, permanence must be accomplished.
