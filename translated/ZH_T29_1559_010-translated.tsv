At the time of arising, at that time they perish. Therefore, grasping this dharma and going to another place is not reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b20_7']	是故身業非行動，此義亦可然。	是故身業非行動，此義亦可然。	Therefore, the meaning of bodily action not being movement is also possible.

['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b23_19']	因緣者為生有法，滅非有法。	因緣者為生有法，滅非有法。	The causes and conditions are for the arising of existent dharmas, not for the cessation of non-existent dharmas.

['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b25_1']	此滅既無所有，故不須因。	此滅既無所有，故不須因。	Since this cessation is non-existent, it does not require a cause.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b26_2']	有法生時次若無滅，後時亦應無，有法無異故。	有法生時次若無滅，後時亦應無，有法無異故。	If a dharma arises and then does not cease, it should not cease later, because the dharma is without change.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b27_3']	若汝言此法變異方有滅，此法即非此變異故。	若汝言此法變異方有滅，此法即非此變異故。	If you say that dharma changes and then ceases, that dharma is not that change.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b27_8']	是義不然。	是義不然。	This is not reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b27_12']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b28_8']	此法自體由自體變異，無如此理。	此法自體由自體變異，無如此理。	It is not reasonable for the self-nature of a dharma to change due to its own self-nature.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225b29_4']	若證見薪等由火相應故，滅不顯現。	若證見薪等由火相應故，滅不顯現。	If you see that fuel, etc. cease due to conjunction with fire,

['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c01_2']	為與火相應，薪等滅盡故不可見。	為與火相應，薪等滅盡故不可見。	It is because fuel, etc. cease and become invisible due to conjunction with fire.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c01_17']	為自然滅，餘不更生，故不可見。	為自然滅，餘不更生，故不可見。	It is because they naturally cease and do not arise again, so they become invisible.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c02_15']	譬如與風相應故燈滅，與手相應故鈴聲滅。	譬如與風相應故燈滅，與手相應故鈴聲滅。	For example, a lamp goes out due to conjunction with wind, and the sound of a bell ceases due to conjunction with the hand.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c03_6']	是故此義由比量得成。	是故此義由比量得成。	Therefore, this meaning is established by inference.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c03_14']	此中何法為比量？	此中何法為比量？	What is inference here?
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c04_5']	已說由滅非因所作故。	已說由滅非因所作故。	It is said that cessation is not produced by a cause.

['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c04_19']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c05_14']	若滅必由因則無滅，無因所生故。	若滅必由因則無滅，無因所生故。	If cessation must have a cause, then there is no cessation, because it is not produced by a cause.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c07_5']	剎那生滅法，如智聲光等，見此滅無因，是故知一切滅皆不觀因。	剎那生滅法，如智聲光等，見此滅無因，是故知一切滅皆不觀因。	Dharmas that arise and cease in a moment, like cognition, sound, light, etc., are seen to cease without a cause. Therefore we know that all cessations do not depend on a cause.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c08_18']	若有人執由別智故餘智滅，由別聲故餘聲滅，是義不然，二智不俱起故。	若有人執由別智故餘智滅，由別聲故餘聲滅，是義不然，二智不俱起故。	If someone holds that one cognition ceases due to another cognition, and one sound ceases due to another sound, this is not so, because two cognitions do not arise simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c09_18']	疑智及決智，無道理得俱起，苦樂瞋欲亦爾。	疑智及決智，無道理得俱起，苦樂瞋欲亦爾。	Doubtful cognition and decisive cognition cannot reasonably arise simultaneously, nor can pleasure and pain, or desire and aversion.
['ZH_T29_1559_010:0225c11_13']	若明了智及聲生，次第不明了智及聲生，云何不明了等類法能滅明了等類法？	若明了智及聲生，次第不明了智及聲生，云何不明了等類法能滅明了等類法？	If a clear cognition and sound arise, and then a less clear cognition and sound arise in sequence, how can a less clear type of dharma cease a clear type of dharma?
