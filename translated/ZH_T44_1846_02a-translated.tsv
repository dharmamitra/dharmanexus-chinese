['ZH_T44_1846_02a:0259a15_1']	是故一切眾生不名為覺以從本來念念相續未曾離念故說無始無明　舉失中言是故者。	是故一切眾生不名為覺以從本來念念相續未曾離念故說無始無明　舉失中言是故者。	02a	Therefore all sentient beings are not called awakened, because from the beginningless beginning, thought after thought has been continuous, never apart from thought.

['ZH_T44_1846_02a:0259a15_10']	是前無念名為覺故。	是前無念名為覺故。	02a	Because the previous no-thought is called awakening,
