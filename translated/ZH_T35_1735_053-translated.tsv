['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c11_1']	今初，前三地寄同世間，有見等惑，猶如生食在腹。	今初，前三地寄同世間，有見等惑，猶如生食在腹。	053	First, the first three grounds are likened to raw food in the belly, with views and other delusions still present.

['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c14_2']	今是彼清淨對治之因，故名為道。	今是彼清淨對治之因，故名為道。	053	Now, this is the cause for that pure antidote, thus it is called the path.

['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c17_2']	結云不雜二乘者，以於十句雙行而修故，不同二乘見道離生矣。	結云不雜二乘者，以於十句雙行而修故，不同二乘見道離生矣。	053	The conclusion states not mixed with the two vehicles because by cultivating the ten phrases of dual practice, it is different from the two vehicles' path of seeing and being free from birth.

['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c20_2']	」十中，前五自分、後五勝進。	」十中，前五自分、後五勝進。	053	Among the ten, the first five are one's own benefits, and the latter five are benefiting others.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c21_2']	第三「出生佛法」下三門，明對治修行增長。	第三「出生佛法」下三門，明對治修行增長。	053	The third, from giving rise to the Buddha's teachings below, has three gates, clarifying the increase of counteracting practice.

['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c23_6']	此門正明增長、後門顯立勝名。	此門正明增長、後門顯立勝名。	053	This gate correctly clarifies the increase, and the latter gate reveals the establishment of the superior name.

['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c26_8']	十中，初二順人信法、次二願智不虛、次二時處廣長、次二無間普遍、後二勝行攝生。	十中，初二順人信法、次二願智不虛、次二時處廣長、次二無間普遍、後二勝行攝生。	053	Among the ten, the first two are in accord with people's faith in the Dharma, the next two are the non-falseness of vows and wisdom, the next two are the vastness of time and place, the next two are the uninterrupted pervasiveness, and the last two are the superior practices that embrace beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c27_11']	二、丈夫名號，即立勝名，由德行內增，故嘉名外立。	二、丈夫名號，即立勝名，由德行內增，故嘉名外立。	053	Second, the name of the hero, which is the establishment of the superior name, is due to the internal increase of virtuous practices, and therefore the excellent name is established externally.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0899c28_15']	十中，前四從境立名、五六約當體受名，上皆自利；	十中，前四從境立名、五六約當體受名，上皆自利；	053	Among the ten, the first four are named from the object, the fifth and sixth are named according to the essence, the above are all one's own benefits;

['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a01_14']	後一勝進果，稱上皆隨德假名故。	後一勝進果，稱上皆隨德假名故。	053	The last one is the fruit of superior progress. All the above are provisional names based on virtue.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a03_9']	《瑜伽》四十六明菩薩隨德假名有十六種，初名菩提薩埵，十六名為法師。	《瑜伽》四十六明菩薩隨德假名有十六種，初名菩提薩埵，十六名為法師。	053	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, fascicle forty-six, explains that the provisional names based on virtue for bodhisattvas are of sixteen kinds. The first is called bodhisattva, and the sixteenth is called Dharma master.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a04_5']	《顯揚》第八、《莊嚴論》十二皆同此說。	《顯揚》第八、《莊嚴論》十二皆同此說。	053	The eighth fascicle of the Abhidharmasamuccaya and the twelfth fascicle of the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras both explain it in the same way.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a05_3']	又《商主天子經》五義立名，恐繁不會。	又《商主天子經》五義立名，恐繁不會。	053	Moreover, the Sūtra of the Heavenly Prince Śreṣṭhin establishes the name with five meanings, but fearing it would be too much, I will not discuss it here.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a05_17']	第二、有十種道，明修行對治。	第二、有十種道，明修行對治。	053	Second, there are ten kinds of paths, clarifying the practice of counteracting.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a06_8']	《地經》寄位廣明三十七品；	《地經》寄位廣明三十七品；	053	The Sutra on the Stages provisionally uses the stages to extensively clarify the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment;
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a07_10']	今約實位故，增數顯十皆為對治，並是正道。	今約實位故，增數顯十皆為對治，並是正道。	053	Now, because it is based on the actual stages, it increases the number to show that the ten are all for counteracting and are all the correct path.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a09_7']	十中，前二後一名義皆不共，三道則名義俱共，四道至九名共小乘，義唯實教。	十中，前二後一名義皆不共，三道則名義俱共，四道至九名共小乘，義唯實教。	053	Among the ten, the first two, the last one, the name and meaning are all not shared. The three paths have both name and meaning in common. The four paths up to the ninth have the same name as the Hīnayāna, but the meaning is only in the true teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a09_12']	前三可知。	前三可知。	053	The first three are understandable.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a10_13']	言義唯實者，故四行云「善巧迴向，無休息故。	言義唯實者，故四行云「善巧迴向，無休息故。	053	As for the meaning of reality, the four practices say: Skillfully dedicating without rest.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a13_2']	」五根定根知三昧入出，六通天眼見死此生彼，七六念成七，加念眾生為大悲故，亦是廣七覺中一念覺故。	」五根定根知三昧入出，六通天眼見死此生彼，七六念成七，加念眾生為大悲故，亦是廣七覺中一念覺故。	053	The five roots are the root of concentration, knowing the entry and exit of samādhi. The six supernormal powers are seeing death and rebirth with the heavenly eye. The seven are accomplished with the six recollections, and adding the recollection of sentient beings is for great compassion, which is also one recollection among the seven expanded factors of enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a13_7']	餘例此知。	餘例此知。	053	The rest can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a13_17']	八正思惟，順一切智。	八正思惟，順一切智。	053	The eight right thoughts accord with omniscience.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a14_8']	九次第定，皆寂用雙行。	九次第定，皆寂用雙行。	053	The nine successive concentrations all have both tranquility and function.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a15_15']	初禪離欲恚害而逆化眾生，亦用欲等言說，故云一切語業。	初禪離欲恚害而逆化眾生，亦用欲等言說，故云一切語業。	053	The first concentration is free from desire, anger, and harm, but transforms sentient beings in reverse, also using desire, etc., to speak, therefore it is said to be all verbal actions.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a16_12']	二禪雖無覺觀，不壞淨覺以為說因。	二禪雖無覺觀，不壞淨覺以為說因。	053	Although the second concentration is without initial and sustained thought, the pure thought without destruction is used as the cause of speech.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a17_4']	三禪離喜，而生法喜。	三禪離喜，而生法喜。	053	The third concentration is free from joy, but gives rise to the joy of the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a17_16']	四禪離樂，而受解脫道樂。	四禪離樂，而受解脫道樂。	053	The fourth concentration is free from bliss, but experiences the bliss of the path of liberation.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a18_14']	從「此不」下明四無色定，但總相顯勝。	從「此不」下明四無色定，但總相顯勝。	053	From this is not below, it clarifies the four formless concentrations, but generally shows the superiority.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a22_3']	「雖住滅」下即滅盡定，此定雖盡滅諸不恒行心心所法，及滅恒行染污一分，而以厭患想受為先，故名滅想受定，由非想地猶有細想，是捨受故。	「雖住滅」下即滅盡定，此定雖盡滅諸不恒行心心所法，及滅恒行染污一分，而以厭患想受為先，故名滅想受定，由非想地猶有細想，是捨受故。	053	Although abiding in cessation refers to the attainment of cessation. Although this attainment completely ceases all non-perpetually active mental factors and mental functions, and also ceases the defiled portion of the perpetually active [mental factors and mental functions], it is still called the attainment of the cessation of conceptualization and sensation because it is preceded by the aversion to conceptualization and sensation. This is because the stage of non-conceptualization still has subtle conceptualization, which is the sensation of equanimity.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a23_2']	今實教明即受等性滅，故不息菩薩行。	今實教明即受等性滅，故不息菩薩行。	053	Now, in the true teaching, it is clarified that the nature of sensation and so forth is extinguished, and therefore it does not cease the practice of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a23_18']	是以七地云能念念入，亦念念起等。	是以七地云能念念入，亦念念起等。	053	Therefore, the seventh ground says that one can enter [the attainment of cessation] moment by moment, and also arise from it moment by moment, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a24_8']	餘如三地及七地中辨。	餘如三地及七地中辨。	053	The rest is explained in the third ground and the seventh ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a25_16']	十力中，六「遍一切」下，是一切至處道智，八是天眼，九是宿命。	十力中，六「遍一切」下，是一切至處道智，八是天眼，九是宿命。	053	Among the ten powers, the first six, beginning with pervading all, are the knowledge of the path that leads everywhere. The eighth is the divine eye, and the ninth is the knowledge of past lives.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a26_8']	今三世悉知，況乎宿命。	今三世悉知，況乎宿命。	053	Now, one knows the three times completely, let alone one's past lives.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a26_15']	餘如初會中辨。	餘如初會中辨。	053	The rest is explained in the first assembly.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a27_12']	第五「無量道」下二門，明五地中行。	第五「無量道」下二門，明五地中行。	053	The fifth, the two gates below immeasurable paths, clarify the practices in the fifth ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a27_15']	分二：	分二：	053	It is divided into two:
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a28_14']	此門明勝慢對治中行、後門明後二分中行。	此門明勝慢對治中行、後門明後二分中行。	053	This section clarifies the practice of the superior antidotes to pride, while the following section clarifies the practice within the latter two divisions.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900a29_1']	今初，分二：	今初，分二：	053	Now, the first part is divided into two:
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b01_12']	先總標四門，以此四門同顯道義，義皆無量，類例相從，故總標之。	先總標四門，以此四門同顯道義，義皆無量，類例相從，故總標之。	053	First, four approaches are generally indicated, because these four approaches equally reveal the meaning of the Way, and the meaning is all immeasurable. They are classified together, so they are generally indicated.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b02_3']	約義須分，故後二屬後。	約義須分，故後二屬後。	053	Since they must be distinguished according to the meaning, the latter two are included in the following.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b03_17']	二從「佛子」下別明初門，謂十平等心及隨如道行，皆是菩薩正道所遊路故。	二從「佛子」下別明初門，謂十平等心及隨如道行，皆是菩薩正道所遊路故。	053	Second, from Buddha's disciple below, the first approach is specifically clarified, namely the ten minds of equality and the practice in accordance with the Way, because they are all the path traversed by the bodhisattva's correct Way.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b05_6']	以觸境皆如，道無不在，況虛空等十一一無量，道豈有涯？	以觸境皆如，道無不在，況虛空等十一一無量，道豈有涯？	053	Since all phenomena encountered are suchness, the Way is omnipresent. How much more so are the eleven such as space each immeasurable, and how could the Way have limits?
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b06_3']	十中，前四各一無量、後四皆佛界無量。	十中，前四各一無量、後四皆佛界無量。	053	Among the ten, the first four each have one immeasurability, while the latter four all have the Buddha realm as the immeasurability.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b06_16']	語言亦屬眾生，亦是調伏界。	語言亦屬眾生，亦是調伏界。	053	Language is also related to sentient beings, and it is also the realm of taming.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b07_13']	無量劫數即豎論無量，餘七橫論無量。	無量劫數即豎論無量，餘七橫論無量。	053	Immeasurable eons are discussed vertically as immeasurable, while the remaining seven are discussed horizontally as immeasurable.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b08_8']	虛空亦橫亦豎，法界非橫非豎。	虛空亦橫亦豎，法界非橫非豎。	053	Space is both horizontal and vertical, while the Dharma realm is neither horizontal nor vertical.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b09_9']	虛空法界約無分量，餘八廣多無量兼無分量。	虛空法界約無分量，餘八廣多無量兼無分量。	053	As for the Dharma realm of space, it is in terms of having no divisions. The other eight are both vast and numerous, and also have no divisions.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b10_10']	二、無量助道，即不住道行勝，及彼果勝中行。	二、無量助道，即不住道行勝，及彼果勝中行。	053	Second, immeasurable auxiliary paths refer to the superior practice of the path of non-abiding, as well as the superior practice within the superior fruition.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b11_10']	以智契如是謂正道，萬行資緣皆為助道。	以智契如是謂正道，萬行資緣皆為助道。	053	Using wisdom to accord with suchness is called the correct path. The myriad practices and supportive conditions are all auxiliary paths.
['ZH_T35_1735_053:0900b12_1']	此二合行，名不住道。	此二合行，名不住道。	053	The combined practice of these two is called the path of non-abiding.
