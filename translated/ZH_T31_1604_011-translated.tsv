If there is no meaning of moment-to-moment cessation and there is the continuity of conditioned phenomena called arising, it is not so.
['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646b14_7']	若汝言物有暫時住，後時先者滅、後者起名相續者，則無相續，由暫住時後起無故。	若汝言物有暫時住，後時先者滅、後者起名相續者，則無相續，由暫住時後起無故。	If you say that things temporarily abide, and later the former cease and the latter arise, called continuity, then there is no continuity, because there is no arising later due to the time of temporary abiding.
['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646b15_14']	第二從因者，凡物前滅後起必籍因緣，若離因緣則無體故。	第二從因者，凡物前滅後起必籍因緣，若離因緣則無體故。	Second, from causes, all things that cease before and arise later must depend on causes and conditions, because if they are apart from causes and conditions, they have no substance.
['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646b17_12']	若汝言彼物初因能生後時多果者，不然，初因作業即便滅盡，豈得與後諸果作因？	若汝言彼物初因能生後時多果者，不然，初因作業即便滅盡，豈得與後諸果作因？	If you say that the initial cause can produce many effects later, that is not so. The initial cause performs its function and then ceases. How can it serve as a cause for later effects?
['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646b18_14']	若汝言初因起已更不起者，建立此因復何所用？	若汝言初因起已更不起者，建立此因復何所用？	If you say that the initial cause arises and does not arise again, what is the use of establishing this cause?

Arising and cessation are contradictory, and it is unreasonable for them to have the same cause. Just as light and darkness do not coexist, and cold and heat are not simultaneous, so it is here. Therefore, the cause of arising is not the same as the cause of cessation.

['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646c07_15']	火變鐵譬，我無此理，鐵與火合黑相似滅赤相似起，能牽赤相似起是火功能，實非以火變於黑鐵。	火變鐵譬，我無此理，鐵與火合黑相似滅赤相似起，能牽赤相似起是火功能，實非以火變於黑鐵。	The analogy of iron changing due to fire is not reasonable. When iron combines with fire, blackness ceases and redness arises. The ability to attract redness is the function of fire, but it is not that fire transforms black iron.

['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646c11_16']	汝執諸行起已非即滅者，是有為法則有少時而非無常，便墮非一向相。	汝執諸行起已非即滅者，是有為法則有少時而非無常，便墮非一向相。	If you hold that conditioned dharmas do not cease immediately after arising, then conditioned dharmas would have a short period of time when they are not impermanent, and you would fall into the error of non-unilateral characteristics.

For example, because the flame arises with similarity, one knows it as an old flame, but in reality there is a difference, because the previous substance does not exist.

['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646c17_6']	若住不滅，則後剎那與初剎那住無差別；	若住不滅，則後剎那與初剎那住無差別；	If it abides without ceasing, then the later moment would be no different from the initial moment;
['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646c18_1']	由有差別，故知後物而非前物。	由有差別，故知後物而非前物。	because there is a difference, you know the later thing is not the previous thing.
['ZH_T31_1604_011:0646c19_15']	第九變異者，若汝言物之初起非即變異者，不然，內外法體後邊不可得故。	第九變異者，若汝言物之初起非即變異者，不然，內外法體後邊不可得故。	As for the ninth, transformation, if you say the initial arising of a thing is not immediately transformed, that is not so, because the final limit of the substance of internal and external dharmas cannot be obtained.

For this reason, the meaning of momentariness is established.
