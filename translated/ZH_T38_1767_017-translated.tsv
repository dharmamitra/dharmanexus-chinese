['ZH_T38_1767_017:0138a02_7']	然約境雖異，緣心無別，如緣貧窮即眾生緣，知此貧人應須衣食即是法緣，若知眾生須知如來受第一樂則無所須即是無緣。	然約境雖異，緣心無別，如緣貧窮即眾生緣，知此貧人應須衣食即是法緣，若知眾生須知如來受第一樂則無所須即是無緣。	017	Although the objects are different, the mind that gives rise to them is no different. For example, if one gives to the poor, it is the practice of compassion for sentient beings. If one knows that the poor person needs clothing and food, it is the practice of compassion for the Dharma. If one knows that sentient beings need to know that the Tathāgata experiences the highest bliss and has no needs, it is the practice of compassion without an object.
['ZH_T38_1767_017:0138a03_3']	能緣既一，不應有四，故只是一緣。	能緣既一，不應有四，故只是一緣。	017	Since the mind that gives rise to compassion is the same, there should not be four types of compassion. Therefore, there is only one type of compassion.

The sharp person likes to be angry and teaches the dull ones, but the dull ones do not understand the ten [virtues] and therefore give rise to anger.
['ZH_T38_1767_017:0138a14_1']	為此義故，須修慈悲以捨瞋心。	為此義故，須修慈悲以捨瞋心。	017	For this meaning, one must cultivate kindness and compassion in order to abandon the mind of anger.
