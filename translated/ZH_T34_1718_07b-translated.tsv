The sixth ground is equal in merit to the two vehicles. The two vehicles at most take sixty kalpas or a hundred kalpas. When bodhisattvas reach the sixth ground, they have already passed twenty-two great kalpas. The two vehicles are far from the Buddha's path and should not be equal.

As the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, The first fruit takes eighty thousand eons to reach the place of the bodhi mind. Those of the three capacities reach this place and immediately understand, and the five kinds of people reaching this place are called crossing the five hundred. This takes the extremely dull one, so it is said to reach in eighty thousand eons. The sharp person does not necessarily do so. Those who attained the four fruits in the Buddha's time, hearing the Lotus Sūtra, all gave rise to the aspiration for enlightenment. Why must it be eighty thousand eons?

Abandoning the city of the Dharma and advancing to the place of treasures, if the five people are both saved and both advanced, they lose the meaning of the parable of the city of the Dharma.

The fire pit is the three realms, and the deep water is the two vehicles. The three realms are the prison of the two vehicles, and the two vehicles are the prison of the bodhisattvas.
