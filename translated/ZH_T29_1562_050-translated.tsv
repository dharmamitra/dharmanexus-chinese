For all forms that your eyes do not see, have not seen, will not see, and do not desire to see, do you give rise to desire, give rise to craving, give rise to affection, give rise to attachment, give rise to a storehouse consciousness, give rise to a niyata, give rise to indulgence because of this?🔽No.

['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b01_15']	故此事中有貪瞋慢於過去世已生未斷，現在已生能繫此事，以貪瞋慢是自相惑，非諸有情定遍起故。	故此事中有貪瞋慢於過去世已生未斷，現在已生能繫此事，以貪瞋慢是自相惑，非諸有情定遍起故。	Therefore, in this matter, craving, hatred, and pride that have already arisen in the past but have not yet been eliminated, and those that have already arisen in the present can bind this matter, because craving, hatred, and pride are afflictions of specific characteristics, and not all sentient beings necessarily give rise to them universally.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b04_4']	豈不已斷繫義便無，既說繫言已顯未斷，何緣說此被未斷繫，復說過去已生未斷，此未斷言應成無用。	豈不已斷繫義便無，既說繫言已顯未斷，何緣說此被未斷繫，復說過去已生未斷，此未斷言應成無用。	How can it be that if they have already been eliminated, the meaning of being bound is not present? Since it is already said that they are bound, it has already been made clear that they have not yet been eliminated. What is the reason for saying that they are bound by what has not yet been eliminated, and also saying that those that have already arisen in the past but have not yet been eliminated? The words not yet eliminated should become useless.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b05_3']	無無用過，此未斷言顯有品別漸次斷故。	無無用過，此未斷言顯有品別漸次斷故。	There is no fault of being useless. These words not yet eliminated show that there are different levels and that they are eliminated gradually.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b08_1', 'ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b11_6']	即於此論次下文中，亦說未來意遍行等，謂彼貪等九品不同，修道斷時九品別斷，有緣此事，上品隨眠已起已滅已得永斷。🔽彼於此事尚有未來餘品隨眠未起未滅，未得永斷猶能為繫，是故本論於此義中，雖說未來愛等所繫，而於過去說未斷言，故未斷言深成有用。	即於此論次下文中，亦說未來意遍行等，謂彼貪等九品不同，修道斷時九品別斷，有緣此事，上品隨眠已起已滅已得永斷。 彼於此事尚有未來餘品隨眠未起未滅，未得永斷猶能為繫，是故本論於此義中，雖說未來愛等所繫，而於過去說未斷言，故未斷言深成有用。	The treatise itself, immediately below, also speaks of future mental activities that are universal mental factors, etc., referring to the nine grades of the passions that are not the same, and when they are eliminated by the path of cultivation, they are eliminated one by one in nine grades. When the superior grade of the propensities that have this as their object have already arisen, have already been extinguished, and have already attained eternal extinction,🔽there still remain in the future other grades of propensities that have this as their object that have not yet arisen, have not yet been extinguished, and have not yet attained eternal extinction, and they are still able to bind. Consequently, although the treatise says that one is bound by future craving, etc., it says that one is not yet freed from them in the past. Therefore, the words not yet freed have a profound meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b15_2']	然過去世此品隨眠得永斷時未來亦斷，容有餘品未來隨眠能繫此事未得永斷，以未來世意識相應貪瞋慢三遍緣三世，雖於此事或生不生，但未斷時皆名能繫。	然過去世此品隨眠得永斷時未來亦斷，容有餘品未來隨眠能繫此事未得永斷，以未來世意識相應貪瞋慢三遍緣三世，雖於此事或生不生，但未斷時皆名能繫。	However, when the propensities of this grade in the past have already attained eternal extinction, those of the future are also extinguished. There may be other propensities of the future that bind this object, and they have not yet attained eternal extinction. In the future, the three passions of craving, hatred, and pride associated with manas are universally able to take the three times as objects. Even though they may or may not arise with regard to a given object, as long as they have not yet been eliminated, they are all called able to bind.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b16_3']	未來五識相應貪瞋，若未斷可生，唯繫未來世。	未來五識相應貪瞋，若未斷可生，唯繫未來世。	Future attachment and anger associated with the five consciousnesses, if not yet eliminated and able to be born, only bind future dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b16_16']	由此已顯五識相應可生隨眠。	由此已顯五識相應可生隨眠。	By this, it is already shown that the proclivities able to be born associated with the five consciousnesses are future.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b17_11']	若至過去唯繫過去，至現亦爾。	若至過去唯繫過去，至現亦爾。	If they reach the past, they only bind past dharmas; if they reach the present, it is the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b18_19']	義准若與意識相應可生隨眠，若至過現未斷，容繫非自世法。	義准若與意識相應可生隨眠，若至過現未斷，容繫非自世法。	By implication, if the proclivities able to be born associated with mental consciousness reach the past and present and are not yet eliminated, they can bind dharmas of their own time.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b20_17']	非唯意識相應隨眠若在未來能縛三世，諸與五識相應隨眠，若定不生，亦縛三世。	非唯意識相應隨眠若在未來能縛三世，諸與五識相應隨眠，若定不生，亦縛三世。	Not only are the proclivities associated with mental consciousness, if in the future, able to bind the three times. The proclivities associated with the five consciousnesses, if definitely not born, also bind the three times.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b22_15']	謂彼境界或在未來、或在現在、或在過去，彼雖已得畢竟不生，而未斷時性能繫縛。	謂彼境界或在未來、或在現在、或在過去，彼雖已得畢竟不生，而未斷時性能繫縛。	That is, their objects may be in the future, or they may be in the present or past. Even though they have already been acquired and will never be born, as long as they are not yet eliminated, their nature is able to bind.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b24_13']	所餘一切見疑無明，去來未斷，遍縛三世，由此三種是共相惑，一切有情俱遍縛故。	所餘一切見疑無明，去來未斷，遍縛三世，由此三種是共相惑，一切有情俱遍縛故。	The remaining views, ignorance, and doubt, whether past or future, if not yet eliminated, universally bind the three times, because these three kinds are delusions with common characteristics, and all sentient beings are universally bound by them.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b25_13']	若現在世正緣境時，隨其所應，能縛此事。	若現在世正緣境時，隨其所應，能縛此事。	When it is in the present, it binds this thing according to its circumstances.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b27_1']	以何為證，知貪等惑緣過去等三世境生，即於其中能為繫縛？	以何為證，知貪等惑緣過去等三世境生，即於其中能為繫縛？	What is the evidence that attachment and other passions arise in relation to objects of the three periods of time, past, etc., and that they bind in regard to them?
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b27_11']	由聖教證，故契經言：	由聖教證，故契經言：	It is known through holy teachings. A scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621b29_7']	欲貪處法總有三種，一者過去欲貪處法、二者未來欲貪處法、三者現在欲貪處法。	欲貪處法總有三種，一者過去欲貪處法、二者未來欲貪處法、三者現在欲貪處法。	There are three kinds of things that are objects of attachment and desire: those of the past, those of the future, and those of the present.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621c02_6']	若緣過去欲貪處法生於欲貪，此欲貪生當言於彼過去諸法繫非離繫，乃至廣說。	若緣過去欲貪處法生於欲貪，此欲貪生當言於彼過去諸法繫非離繫，乃至廣說。	If attachment and desire arise in relation to things that are objects of attachment and desire in the past, these attachments and desires are said to bind one to those past things and not to liberate one from them. The same is said of future and present things.
['ZH_T29_1562_050:0621c02_11']	又契經言：	又契經言：	A scripture says,

Attachment and desire are the true bonds.

First, the objects of consciousness in dreams are not established as nonexistent, because when one is about to fall asleep, one imagines and thinks, or while one is sleeping, one is blessed by a celestial spirit, or because the various elements within the body are mutually opposed, therefore in the state of sleep, one gives rise to a thought that pursues and remembers past objects and calls it a dream.

For example, a bodhisattva may dream of something he has heard, and there are those who dream of seeing rabbit horns.
