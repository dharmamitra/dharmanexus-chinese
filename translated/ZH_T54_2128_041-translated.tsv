It is a pictograph of a crescent moon. 星 (xīng) refers to the stars of the five elements. As for 明星 (míng xīng), it is not always present. It is the stars of metal, wood, fire, earth, and water. Sometimes they appear near the sun in the early morning. Those who observe the weather should know that the sun will rise soon. Therefore, various sūtras sometimes have the phrase 明星 (míng xīng). The Buddha uses the nearby star as a metaphor, saying that Maitreya Bodhisattva is close to the Buddha's stage. The old interpretation says that in the West, they observe the three stars at night. First, they observe the white star, then the blue star, and finally the red star. This greatly deviates from the meaning of the sūtra and is a false explanation.

Zheng Xuan's commentary on the Book of Poetry says: The day of reaping is se. The Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs says: Planting is called jia, and reaping is called se. Shuowen defines jia as the mature grain of a plant. Another explanation is that jia means the affairs of the household.
