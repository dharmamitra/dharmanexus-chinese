['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a13_10']	一證時微，如經「聖主道故」；	一證時微，如經「聖主道故」；	010	1. Subtlety in realization, as the sutra says because it is the path of the holy lord;

Subtlety in transcending thought, as the sutra says because it cannot be attained through conceptualization, this reveals that the essence is free from thought and is not attained through conceptual analysis;
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a16_20']	四依止微，如經「唯智行處故」，此顯既非比智境，是誰能知？	四依止微，如經「唯智行處故」，此顯既非比智境，是誰能知？	010	4. Subtlety in reliance, as the sutra says because it is the domain of wisdom alone, this reveals that if it is not the realm of conceptual wisdom, who can know it?
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a17_4']	證智行故。	證智行故。	010	Because it is the practice of realized wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a18_12']	論釋中，自證知者，釋智行義，謂內自證故名行，非謂遊故名行。	論釋中，自證知者，釋智行義，謂內自證故名行，非謂遊故名行。	010	In the commentary, self-realization explains the meaning of practice, which means it is called practice because it is realized within oneself, not because it wanders.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a20_3']	依彼生者，釋行處義，謂此真如是一切依處，復是此智依生之處。	依彼生者，釋行處義，謂此真如是一切依處，復是此智依生之處。	010	Dependent on that explains the meaning of place of practice, which means that this suchness is the place of dependence for all, and is also the place where this cognition arises.

['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a22_8']	一善解法者，是加行勝解故；	一善解法者，是加行勝解故；	010	First, well understanding the Dharma is the superior understanding of the stage of added effort;
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a23_8']	二善寂滅者，是正體智，令惑永滅，證寂理故；	二善寂滅者，是正體智，令惑永滅，證寂理故；	010	Second, well extinguished is the cognition of the stage of insight, which causes afflictions to be eternally extinguished and realizes the principle of quiescence;
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a25_15']	三世間智，隨聞明了知者是後得智，隨聞上地勝進明了無錯謬故，以此三智俱堪趣地得為智者也。	三世間智，隨聞明了知者是後得智，隨聞上地勝進明了無錯謬故，以此三智俱堪趣地得為智者也。	010	Third, worldly cognition, clearly understanding according to what is heard is the cognition of the stage of cultivation, which clearly and unerringly understands according to what is heard about the superior progress of the upper stages. Because these three kinds of cognition are all able to progress to the stages, they are called cognizant ones.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296a26_15']	五清淨微，如經「其性從本來寂然故」。	五清淨微，如經「其性從本來寂然故」。	010	Fifth, pure subtlety, as the sutra says its nature is originally quiescent.

['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296b01_8']	言無滅者，非一往滅，為不捨利益眾生故。	言無滅者，非一往滅，為不捨利益眾生故。	010	As for no ceasing, it is not a one-sided cessation, because it does not abandon benefiting sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296b02_14']	言無生者，出世間故、如是此智不住涅槃世間中故。	言無生者，出世間故、如是此智不住涅槃世間中故。	010	As for no arising, it is because it is supramundane, and such wisdom does not abide in either nirvana or the mundane world.

['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296b10_1']	此相總明果法。	此相總明果法。	010	This generally clarifies the characteristics of the fruition dharmas.

It is like empty space, distinguished according to the explanations, and the differences are precisely emptiness. The dharmas of the grounds are like this.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0296b15_8']	今明此相總是地智，論釋云「智相有二種，等智即是地智。	今明此相總是地智，論釋云「智相有二種，等智即是地智。	010	Now, clarifying these characteristics is precisely the wisdom of the grounds. The treatise explains, The characteristics of wisdom are of two kinds. The equal wisdom is precisely the wisdom of the grounds.

['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c14_9']	愚品類惡趣業果，體雖非愚，愚所發業及所感果，總說為愚。	愚品類惡趣業果，體雖非愚，愚所發業及所感果，總說為愚。	010	The category of delusion, the karmic fruits of evil destinies, although not delusion itself, the karma produced by delusion and the fruits it produces are generally referred to as delusion.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c17_2']	彼論又說「利鈍障品俱起無明以為二愚，即與五見利品俱起同時無明名為初愚，與貪等鈍品俱起名為後愚。	彼論又說「利鈍障品俱起無明以為二愚，即與五見利品俱起同時無明名為初愚，與貪等鈍品俱起名為後愚。	010	That treatise also says: The ignorance that arises simultaneously with the categories of sharp and dull obstacles is taken as the two delusions. The ignorance that arises simultaneously with the five views, which are sharp, is called the first delusion.

['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c19_8']	此初釋麁重即是二愚種子。	此初釋麁重即是二愚種子。	010	This first explanation takes gross and heavy to be the seeds of the two delusions.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c20_8']	惡故名麁、沈沒稱重，故知二愚唯約現行。	惡故名麁、沈沒稱重，故知二愚唯約現行。	010	Because they are evil, they are called “coarse,” and because they are submerged, they are called “heavy.” Therefore it should be understood that the two kinds of delusions refer only to actual dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c22_2']	後釋是二愚所引，令身心中無堪任性，麁更沈重，故名麁重非現非種。	後釋是二愚所引，令身心中無堪任性，麁更沈重，故名麁重非現非種。	010	The later explanation is that the two kinds of delusions attract and cause the body and mind to be devoid of the quality of being fit for action, and they are coarse, heavy, and submerged. Therefore they are called “coarse and heavy,” and they are neither seeds nor actual dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c22_12']	准此，二愚亦通種子。	准此，二愚亦通種子。	010	In accordance with this, the two kinds of delusions also extend to seeds.

['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c25_11']	汎論斷義，有其三種：	汎論斷義，有其三種：	010	Generally speaking, there are three kinds of meanings of elimination:
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c27_9']	一自性斷，謂諸煩惱及相應心心所，不善有覆無記諸染污法，見修道生，惑種永斷。	一自性斷，謂諸煩惱及相應心心所，不善有覆無記諸染污法，見修道生，惑種永斷。	010	1. Elimination by nature, which refers to the various passions and the mind and mental factors associated with them, the unwholesome, the covered unwholesome, the covered neutral, and the defiled dharmas. The seeds of the passions that arise in the paths of insight and cultivation are eternally eliminated.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0300c29_8']	此中心王、遍行、別境性非染污，非可斷法，與煩惱俱名相應縛，斷煩惱故亦說名斷。	此中心王、遍行、別境性非染污，非可斷法，與煩惱俱名相應縛，斷煩惱故亦說名斷。	010	The mind king, the universal activities, and the specific activities are not defiled, and are not dharmas to be eliminated. When they accompany the passions, they are called bound by association. When the passions are eliminated, they are also said to be eliminated.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0301a02_14']	二離縛斷，謂有流善無覆無記通色心等，非正違道，性非可斷，由斷六識緣彼煩惱故說為斷。	二離縛斷，謂有流善無覆無記通色心等，非正違道，性非可斷，由斷六識緣彼煩惱故說為斷。	010	Second, elimination by separation from bonds. That is, impure good and non-obscuring indeterminate dharmas, which are neither form nor mind, etc., are not directly opposed to the path, and by nature are not to be eliminated. They are said to be eliminated by eliminating the passions that take them as objects in the six consciousnesses.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0301a04_14']	三不生斷，謂此見道斷見惑已，捨外道身，所依身無，即無想定及無想報竝永不生。	三不生斷，謂此見道斷見惑已，捨外道身，所依身無，即無想定及無想報竝永不生。	010	Third, elimination by non-arising. That is, after the path of insight eliminates the view-attachments, the body of a non-Buddhist is abandoned. The basis of the body being absent, the attainments of non-perception and the retribution of non-perception are both eternally non-arisen.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0301a05_15']	又招三惡道總報惡業，皆非擇滅，亦名不生。	又招三惡道總報惡業，皆非擇滅，亦名不生。	010	Also, the evil karma that brings about the general retribution of the three evil destinies is also non-analytical cessation, and is also called non-arising.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0301a06_15']	三惡道報、無根、二根、欝單越等，亦皆不生。	三惡道報、無根、二根、欝單越等，亦皆不生。	010	The retributions of the three evil destinies, the absence of sexual organs, the two sexual organs, Uttarakuru, etc., are also all non-arisen.

Above the grounds, one only eliminates the obstacle to that which is to be known and the retribution of transformation.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0301a10_13']	其煩惱障，地前漸伏，初地斷盡。	其煩惱障，地前漸伏，初地斷盡。	010	As for the afflictive hindrances, before the grounds one gradually subdues them, and in the initial ground one eliminates them completely.
['ZH_T35_1733_010:0301a12_3']	所知障，地前亦學伏，初地斷一分，餘在諸地各斷一分，佛地方盡。	所知障，地前亦學伏，初地斷一分，餘在諸地各斷一分，佛地方盡。	010	As for the obstacle to that which is to be known, before the grounds one also studies to subdue them, and in the initial ground one eliminates a portion of them. The rest remain, and in each of the subsequent grounds one eliminates a portion of them. In the stage of Buddha, they are completely eliminated.
