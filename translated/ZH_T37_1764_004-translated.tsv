['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a08_20']	生死法中，「苦名不善」是生死因，「無我煩惱」是生死緣，「無常財物」是生死果，理實齊通，隱顯言之。	生死法中，「苦名不善」是生死因，「無我煩惱」是生死緣，「無常財物」是生死果，理實齊通，隱顯言之。	004	Among the dharmas of birth and death, suffering is called unwholesomeness which is the cause of birth and death, non-self and afflictions are the conditions of birth and death, and impermanent wealth is the fruit of birth and death. In reality, they are equally pervasive, but they are spoken of in terms of concealment and manifestation.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a11_6']	涅槃法中，「樂名為善」是其聖道，「我名祕藏」是其涅槃，「常名佛、法、僧正解脫」是其菩提，理亦齊通，隱顯故耳。	涅槃法中，「樂名為善」是其聖道，「我名祕藏」是其涅槃，「常名佛、法、僧正解脫」是其菩提，理亦齊通，隱顯故耳。	004	In the Dharma of nirvana, happiness is called good refers to the holy path, self is called the secret treasury refers to nirvana, and permanence is called the correct liberation of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha refers to bodhi. The principle is also equally applicable, just hidden and revealed.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a12_13']	就初對中，「以是義」者，以是凡夫偏取皆是斷常義故，理須並學。	就初對中，「以是義」者，以是凡夫偏取皆是斷常義故，理須並學。	004	In the first pair, for this reason means that because ordinary people one-sidedly grasp both [views of] annihilation and permanence, the principle must be learned in both [ways].
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a14_18']	「修餘法苦皆名不善、修餘法樂名為善」者，學觀名修，苦是生死、樂是涅槃，相對辨異是以言「餘」。	「修餘法苦皆名不善、修餘法樂名為善」者，學觀名修，苦是生死、樂是涅槃，相對辨異是以言「餘」。	004	Cultivating other dharmas that are suffering are all called unwholesome, cultivating other dharmas that are happiness are called good means that learning contemplation is called cultivation. Suffering is saṃsāra, and happiness is nirvana. They are distinguished by contrasting them. Therefore, it is said other.

['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a17_11']	善是樂因，因從果稱，說之為樂，亦可樂果從因以名故說為善。	善是樂因，因從果稱，說之為樂，亦可樂果從因以名故說為善。	004	Good is the cause of happiness. The cause is named after the effect, so it is called happiness. It can also be said that the effect of happiness is named after the cause, so it is called good.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a19_1']	第二對中，「修法無我」是生死法，生死無實又不自在，故名無我。	第二對中，「修法無我」是生死法，生死無實又不自在，故名無我。	004	In the second pair, cultivating the non-self of dharmas refers to the dharmas of birth and death. Birth and death are unreal and not independent, so they are called non-self.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a21_7']	「煩惱」是其生死之緣，以有煩惱所受不實，不得自在，從果立稱，故曰無我，亦可無我從本以名說為煩惱。	「煩惱」是其生死之緣，以有煩惱所受不實，不得自在，從果立稱，故曰無我，亦可無我從本以名說為煩惱。	004	Afflictions are the conditions for birth and death. Because of the afflictions, what is received is unreal and not independent. The name is established based on the effect, so it is called non-self. Alternatively, non-self can be named based on the root and called afflictions.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a22_16']	又，此煩惱性是不實，不自在法，故名無我，是故無我即是煩惱。	又，此煩惱性是不實，不自在法，故名無我，是故無我即是煩惱。	004	Moreover, this nature of afflictions is unreal and not an independent dharma, so it is called non-self. Therefore, non-self is precisely the afflictions.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a23_16']	「修餘常者」是涅槃法，此正是我，舉常顯之。	「修餘常者」是涅槃法，此正是我，舉常顯之。	004	Cultivating the other permanence refers to the dharma of nirvāṇa. This is precisely the self. Using permanence to illustrate it.

The dharma is distinguished by permanence and called the secret treasury. It is precisely nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa is the true self. Subtle and hidden, it is called secret. Endowed with virtues, it is called a treasury.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a26_14']	「所謂涅槃」斥其體相，妙出諸有，名「無窟宅」。	「所謂涅槃」斥其體相，妙出諸有，名「無窟宅」。	004	That is to say, nirvāṇa refutes its essence and characteristics. Wonderfully transcending all existence, it is called without a den.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0701a29_3']	「修餘無常」是生死法，「即財物」者生死果報名為財物，「修餘常者」是涅槃法，「謂佛法」等斥其體相，此之佛法是菩提耳。	「修餘無常」是生死法，「即財物」者生死果報名為財物，「修餘常者」是涅槃法，「謂佛法」等斥其體相，此之佛法是菩提耳。	004	Cultivating the impermanent refers to the dharmas of birth and death, and the wealth refers to the fruits of birth and death, which are called wealth. Cultivating the permanent refers to the dharma of nirvana. The Buddha Dharma and so forth refute its essence and characteristics. This Buddha Dharma is simply bodhi.

It correctly concludes based on its characteristics, and explains the meaning of the middle by clarifying the true that is apart from the two.

The first, Ordinary beings have no doubts within it, clarifies that ordinary beings do not recognize the middle way. Ordinary beings have no mind that grasps at the middle way that is apart from the two, and therefore do not give rise to doubts;

First, it sets up a metaphor. The sick person is a metaphor for the ordinary, whose understanding is inferior and called weak, and whose mind is afflicted by delusion and called sick.

The cow is analogous to sentient beings. The mind accepting deluded conditions is called eating grass. The arising of the link of ignorance is analogous to blood. The arising of ignorance and the performance of actions is called blood turning white.

It can also be called the power of conditions giving rise to effects. In order to show the difference between cause and effect, it is said that after extinction, the power of blessings of the calf transforms blood into milk.

Within it, first it corresponds to the analogy to clarify existence. That is to say below brings out the substance of existence. Fearing that worldly people would grasp the Dharma as the same as the analogy, it says that Buddha-nature is not a created Dharma. But below clarifies the reason why sentient beings do not see it. This then clarifies the meaning of its difficulty to see.

If kṣatriyas and so forth eliminate it, they will immediately see and accomplish the unsurpassed path clarifies that bodhisattvas sever delusions and realize seeing.

Because these sentient beings are covered by afflictions and do not see, it is said they have no self.

['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719b19_3']	二「世若無」下對向後難，明二乘人無別得果，當同佛得，故無別乘。	二「世若無」下對向後難，明二乘人無別得果，當同佛得，故無別乘。	004	Second, below if the world is without, it corresponds to the later question and clarifies that the two vehicles do not have a separate attainment of fruition, and should be the same as the Buddha's attainment, so there is no separate vehicle.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719b19_8']	於中還二：	於中還二：	004	In it, there are still two parts:

Second, below As you say, it directly responds to the later criticism that the two vehicles should be the same as the Buddha in attaining [nirvāṇa].
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719b24_15']	前中初言「世若無佛，非無二乘得二涅槃」，反明二乘無別所得，若正，應言「一切世間唯一佛乘，故無二乘得二種涅槃」，此猶經中十方佛土唯一佛乘，無二、無三。	前中初言「世若無佛，非無二乘得二涅槃」，反明二乘無別所得，若正，應言「一切世間唯一佛乘，故無二乘得二種涅槃」，此猶經中十方佛土唯一佛乘，無二、無三。	004	In the first, it initially says, If the world lacks buddhas, it is not that the two vehicles do not attain the two nirvāṇas. This reverses the meaning to clarify that the two vehicles have no separate attainments. If correct, it should say, All worlds have only the One Buddha Vehicle, therefore the two vehicles do not attain the two kinds of nirvāṇa. This is still like the sūtra saying that in the buddha lands of the ten directions there is only the One Buddha Vehicle, with no second or third.

['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719b28_6']	明無量劫乃有一佛出現於世，由佛難出，為化眾生權開三乘而度脫之，非實有三，所以言無。	明無量劫乃有一佛出現於世，由佛難出，為化眾生權開三乘而度脫之，非實有三，所以言無。	004	It clarifies that after immeasurable eons a single buddha appears in the world. Because buddhas are difficult to encounter, in order to transform beings they provisionally open the three vehicles to liberate them. They are not truly three, therefore it says they do not exist.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719c03_1']	第二段中，「如汝所言菩薩二乘無差別者」牒前問辭，迦葉於向初番問中說言「菩薩、聲聞、緣覺性無差別，唯願廣說」，佛今將欲述其所問，辯明三乘所得無別，故今牒之。	第二段中，「如汝所言菩薩二乘無差別者」牒前問辭，迦葉於向初番問中說言「菩薩、聲聞、緣覺性無差別，唯願廣說」，佛今將欲述其所問，辯明三乘所得無別，故今牒之。	004	In the second part, As you have said, there is no distinction between the bodhisattvas and the two vehicles, it cites the question from before. Kāśyapa, in the first round of questions, said, The natures of the bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas are no different. I only wish you would explain this extensively. The Buddha now wishes to recount what he asked and clarify that the three vehicles have nothing different to attain, so he cites it now.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719c06_10']	「我先於此已說其義，諸阿羅漢無有善有」明二乘人現無別得，佛於向前〈四相章〉中說諸羅漢所得涅槃猶如燈滅，無有善有，故今指彼明二乘人所得非有。	「我先於此已說其義，諸阿羅漢無有善有」明二乘人現無別得，佛於向前〈四相章〉中說諸羅漢所得涅槃猶如燈滅，無有善有，故今指彼明二乘人所得非有。	004	I have already explained the meaning of this before. The arhats have no good existence clarifies that the people of the two vehicles currently have nothing different to attain. The Buddha, in the chapter on the four characteristics, said that the nirvāṇa attained by the arhats is like the extinction of a lamp, and has no good existence. Therefore, he now points to that to clarify that what is attained by the people of the two vehicles is not existent.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719c08_8']	亦可次前宣說如來善有、涅槃二乘不得，今指彼也，舉現無得，成其當來同佛得矣。	亦可次前宣說如來善有、涅槃二乘不得，今指彼也，舉現無得，成其當來同佛得矣。	004	It can also be said that, in succession to the previous explanation of the Tathāgata's good existence and nirvāṇa that the two vehicles do not attain, he now points to that. By bringing up the current lack of attainment, it establishes that in the future they will attain the same as the Buddha.

For this reason below concludes in praise of nirvana as ultimate bliss, because all arhats ultimately return to it, therefore one knows that nirvana has ultimate bliss.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0719c14_14']	「是故」已下結嘆涅槃以之為大，三乘同歸故得名大。	「是故」已下結嘆涅槃以之為大，三乘同歸故得名大。	004	For this reason and below concludes in praise of nirvana as great, because the three vehicles return to it together it can be called great.

['ZH_T37_1764_004:0724b19_13']	過有三種：	過有三種：	004	There are three kinds of offenses:
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0724b22_2']	一以已喻彼阿羅漢人，則有見已同凡之過，同彼凡夫有其我想及以命想，若有此想則應擁護，不聽他人打罵毀辱。	一以已喻彼阿羅漢人，則有見已同凡之過，同彼凡夫有其我想及以命想，若有此想則應擁護，不聽他人打罵毀辱。	004	First, if one compares oneself to an arhat, there is the fault of seeing oneself as the same as ordinary beings, the same as those ordinary beings who have the thought of self and the thought of life. If one has these thoughts, one should protect oneself and not allow others to beat, scold, or insult oneself.
['ZH_T37_1764_004:0724b25_17']	二以已喻彼凡夫，便有見阿羅漢同已之過，見阿羅漢同已行人，凡夫造作生死諸行故名行人，故上文言嶮惡道者謂諸行也，若見羅漢同已行人，則是耶見死入地獄。	二以已喻彼凡夫，便有見阿羅漢同已之過，見阿羅漢同已行人，凡夫造作生死諸行故名行人，故上文言嶮惡道者謂諸行也，若見羅漢同已行人，則是耶見死入地獄。	004	Second, if one compares oneself to an ordinary being, there is the fault of seeing an arhat as the same as oneself. Seeing an arhat as the same as oneself means seeing an arhat as the same as a practitioner of ordinary beings. Because ordinary beings create the various activities of birth and death, they are called practitioners. Therefore, the above text says that the dangerous path refers to all activities. If one sees an arhat as the same as oneself, this is a wrong view that leads to hell.

Yet sentient beings kill arhats, not the same as arhats not harming sentient beings. How can it be called comparing oneself to them?

Do not say it is spoken without cause clarifies that it is not without cause. On that day and below show that there is a cause. It was because the hunter killed a deer and invited the Buddha that he spoke this verse. He spoke the first verse to bless the hunter and wish that he would have the same lifespan as the Buddha;

This verse was originally spoken for a woman. That woman was disgusted with the suffering of being attached to her husband, so the Buddha spoke for her, saying All who belong to others are called suffering, causing her to be disgusted with her female body, and All who are self-dependent are at ease and happy, causing her to seek to be a man.
