The beginningless consciousness in dreams forms existent objects. Because of this, deluded karma is passed down, and karmic retribution revolves like a wheel, with no end in sight for eons as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0154c11_4']	故我滿淨覺者現相人中，先說生滅因緣，令悟苦、集、滅、道，既除我執、未達法空，欲盡病根方談般若。	故我滿淨覺者現相人中，先說生滅因緣，令悟苦、集、滅、道，既除我執、未達法空，欲盡病根方談般若。	001	Therefore, the one with perfect pure enlightenment manifested in the human realm first spoke of the causes and conditions of arising and ceasing, causing people to realize suffering, its accumulation, its cessation, and the path. Although one has already eliminated the grasping of self, one has not yet realized the emptiness of dharmas. In order to completely eradicate the roots of illness, he then expounded prajñā.

What is transmitted now is the ninth section. The sentences and verses are concise, and the purport is profound and subtle. Wisdom penetrates the three emptinesses, and giving contains myriad practices. Abiding in eighteen stages, it secretly shows the differences. Cutting off twenty-seven doubts, it secretly communicates the bloodline. Without first dispelling the dispelling, how can one accord with suchness?
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0154c18_16']	故雖策修，始終無相，由斯教理皆密、行果俱玄，致使口諷牛毛、心通麟角，或配入名相著事乖宗，或但云一真望源迷派，其餘胸談臆注不足論矣。	故雖策修，始終無相，由斯教理皆密、行果俱玄，致使口諷牛毛、心通麟角，或配入名相著事乖宗，或但云一真望源迷派，其餘胸談臆注不足論矣。	001	Therefore, although it encourages cultivation, from beginning to end there are no characteristics. Because of this, the teachings and principles are all secret, and the practices and fruits are both profound. This causes those who recite it with their mouths to be as numerous as hairs on a cow, but those whose minds penetrate it are as rare as a unicorn. Some match it with names and forms, attaching to phenomena and deviating from the essence. Some simply say it is the one true reality, losing the source and mistaking the stream. The rest of the chest-pounding and wild conjectures are not worth discussing.

['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a01_1']	若據佛本意，則唯為一大事因緣故出現於世，欲令眾生開佛知見等。	若據佛本意，則唯為一大事因緣故出現於世，欲令眾生開佛知見等。	001	If based on the Buddha's original intention, it is only for the great cause and condition of the one great matter of appearing in the world, wishing to cause sentient beings to open the Buddha's insight, etc.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a01_8']	後別顯此經五：	後別顯此經五：	001	Later, specifically revealing this sūtra in five ways:
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a01_20']	一、為對治我、法二執故。	一、為對治我、法二執故。	001	First, to counteract the two kinds of grasping at self and dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a03_13']	由此二執起煩惱、所知二障，由煩惱障障心，心不解脫，造業受生，輪轉五道；	由此二執起煩惱、所知二障，由煩惱障障心，心不解脫，造業受生，輪轉五道；	001	Because of these two kinds of grasping, the two hindrances of afflictions and the knowable arise. Due to the hindrance of afflictions, the mind is obstructed and not liberated. One creates karma, receives birth, and transmigrates through the five paths.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a05_15']	由所知障障慧，慧不解脫，不了自心、不達諸法性相，縱出三界亦滯二乘，不得成佛，故名障也。	由所知障障慧，慧不解脫，不了自心、不達諸法性相，縱出三界亦滯二乘，不得成佛，故名障也。	001	Due to the hindrance of the knowable, wisdom is obstructed and not liberated. One does not understand one's own mind and does not penetrate the nature and characteristics of all dharmas. Even if one escapes the three realms, one still stagnates in the two vehicles and cannot become a buddha. Therefore, it is called a hindrance.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a06_14']	二執若除，二障隨斷，為除二執，故說此經。	二執若除，二障隨斷，為除二執，故說此經。	001	If the two kinds of grasping are eliminated, the two hindrances are also eliminated. In order to eliminate the two kinds of grasping, this sutra is expounded.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a07_4']	二、為遮斷種現二疑故。	二、為遮斷種現二疑故。	001	Second, to prevent and eliminate the two kinds of doubts, present and future.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a09_6']	遮未起種子之疑、斷現起現行之疑，即經中答所問已便躡跡，節節斷疑，乃至經終二十七段。	遮未起種子之疑、斷現起現行之疑，即經中答所問已便躡跡，節節斷疑，乃至經終二十七段。	001	To prevent the future arising of doubts that have not yet arisen, and to eliminate the present arising of doubts that are presently active. In the sutra, after answering the questions, it continues to eliminate doubts section by section, up to the end of the sutra in twenty-seven sections.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a09_17']	三、為轉滅輕重二業故。	三、為轉滅輕重二業故。	001	Third, to transform and extinguish the two kinds of karma, light and heavy.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a11_2']	轉重業令輕受、滅輕業令不受，因為顯示福慧二因故。	轉重業令輕受、滅輕業令不受，因為顯示福慧二因故。	001	It causes heavy karma to be received lightly and destroys light karma so that it is not received, and for this reason it reveals the two causes of blessings and wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a13_15']	佛成正覺，未說般若之前，眾生由無妙慧，施等住相皆成有漏、或滯二乘，故談般若，顯示妙慧為法身因、五度為應身因。	佛成正覺，未說般若之前，眾生由無妙慧，施等住相皆成有漏、或滯二乘，故談般若，顯示妙慧為法身因、五度為應身因。	001	Before the Buddha attained perfect enlightenment and expounded prajñā, sentient beings, due to lacking wondrous wisdom, all their giving and other practices abiding in characteristics became contaminated or stagnated in the two vehicles. Therefore, he discussed prajñā and revealed wondrous wisdom as the cause for the Dharma body and the five perfections as the cause for the reward body.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a14_15']	若無般若，則施等五非波羅蜜，不名佛因。	若無般若，則施等五非波羅蜜，不名佛因。	001	If there is no prajñā, then giving and the other five are not pāramitās and are not called the cause for Buddhahood.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a15_9']	故須福、慧二嚴，方成兩足尊矣。	故須福、慧二嚴，方成兩足尊矣。	001	Therefore, one must have the two adornments of blessings and wisdom in order to become the Honored One with the Two Distinctions.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a15_20']	五、為發明真應二果故。	五、為發明真應二果故。	001	Fifth, it is for the sake of clarifying the two fruits of the true and the reward.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a18_8']	未聞般若之前，但言色相是佛，不知應化唯真之影，不如實見真身、應身，故此發明二果令知由前二因證得。	未聞般若之前，但言色相是佛，不知應化唯真之影，不如實見真身、應身，故此發明二果令知由前二因證得。	001	Before hearing prajñā, it was only said that form and appearance are the Buddha, and it was not known that the reward and transformation bodies are only the reflections of the true. One did not truly see the true body and the reward body, so this clarifies the two fruits and causes one to know that they are realized through the previous two causes.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a18_17']	第二、明經宗體二。	第二、明經宗體二。	001	Second, clarifying the essence and purport of the sūtra.

['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a20_12']	統論佛教因緣為宗，別顯此經，則實相般若、觀照般若不一不二以為其宗。	統論佛教因緣為宗，別顯此經，則實相般若、觀照般若不一不二以為其宗。	001	Generally speaking, Buddhism takes causes and conditions as its essence. Specifically revealing this sutra, it takes the non-one-and-non-two of the real appearance prajna and the observation prajna as its essence.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a21_13']	以即理之智觀照諸相，故如金剛能斷一切；	以即理之智觀照諸相，故如金剛能斷一切；	001	Because the wisdom that accords with principle observes all appearances, it is like a vajra that can cut through everything;
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a22_12']	即智之理是為實相，故如金剛堅牢難壞。	即智之理是為實相，故如金剛堅牢難壞。	001	The principle that accords with wisdom is the real appearance, therefore it is like a vajra that is solid and difficult to destroy.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a23_13']	萬行之中一一不得昧此，是故合之以為經宗。	萬行之中一一不得昧此，是故合之以為經宗。	001	Among the myriad practices, each and every one cannot be oblivious to this, therefore they are combined to be the essence of the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a23_16']	二體。	二體。	001	Second, the essence.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a24_17']	文字般若即是經體，文字即含聲、名、句、文；	文字般若即是經體，文字即含聲、名、句、文；	001	The prajna of words and letters is precisely the essence of the sutra. Words and letters include sound, name, phrase, and text;
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a26_6']	文字性空即是般若，無別文字之體，故皆含攝理無不盡，統為教體。	文字性空即是般若，無別文字之體，故皆含攝理無不盡，統為教體。	001	The emptiness of the nature of words and letters is precisely prajna, without a separate essence of words and letters, therefore they all include and encompass all principles without exception, collectively being the essence of the teaching.
['ZH_T33_1701_001:0155a26_15']	第三、分別處會二。	第三、分別處會二。	001	Third, distinguishing the place and assembly.
