In this way, they go through hundreds of thousands of lifetimes, and only when the retribution for their resentment comes to an end do they feel ashamed of their defeat. Therefore it is said, When victorious, enemies are destroyed; when defeated, one feels ashamed of oneself.
['ZH_T04_0212_027:0753a19_5']	息則快樂，無勝負心，一切結使永盡無餘，更不復起想著之念，亦復無勝負之心，我勝彼不如、彼勝我不如，都無彼此之心，是故說曰，息則快樂，無勝負心也。	息則快樂，無勝負心，一切結使永盡無餘，更不復起想著之念，亦復無勝負之心，我勝彼不如、彼勝我不如，都無彼此之心，是故說曰，息則快樂，無勝負心也。	027	When at peace, one is happy, without the mind of victory or defeat means that all afflictions are completely extinguished without remainder, and one does not give rise to thoughts of attachment again. There is also no mind of victory or defeat, thinking I am victorious, they are not or They are victorious, I am not. There is no thought of self and other at all. Therefore it is said, When at peace, one is happy, without the mind of victory or defeat.

Even killing someone in a sudden fight can still be forgiven, but harboring poison and plotting in secret is unpardonable. Such people will surely go to a bad realm. The reason is that they hold onto their foolishness and do not let go.

['ZH_T04_0212_027:0753b07_13']	善樂於愛欲者，一切眾生皆貪樂樂不樂苦惱，見苦則群心不願樂，己自行殺教人殺生，己自婬泆教人婬泆，己自妄言綺語復教人妄言綺語，己自不與取復教他人竊盜他物，是故說曰，善樂於愛欲也。	善樂於愛欲者，一切眾生皆貪樂樂不樂苦惱，見苦則群心不願樂，己自行殺教人殺生，己自婬泆教人婬泆，己自妄言綺語復教人妄言綺語，己自不與取復教他人竊盜他物，是故說曰，善樂於愛欲也。	027	Those who delight in love and desire, all sentient beings crave happiness and do not enjoy suffering and distress. Seeing suffering, the minds of the multitude do not wish for happiness. One oneself kills and teaches others to kill, one oneself indulges in lust and teaches others to indulge in lust, one oneself speaks falsely and frivolously and teaches others to speak falsely and frivolously, one oneself takes what is not given and teaches others to steal others' things. Therefore it is said, Those who delight in love and desire.
['ZH_T04_0212_027:0753b09_11']	以杖加群生者，所行非法濫抂百姓，意之所存以傷為本，是故說曰，以杖加群生也。	以杖加群生者，所行非法濫抂百姓，意之所存以傷為本，是故說曰，以杖加群生也。	027	Using a staff to harm sentient beings, one's actions are unlawful and one oppresses the people.

When people engage in evil conduct, it is all for their own sake. Abandoning the body and receiving a form, they encounter various sufferings, transmigrate through birth and death, and drift in the five destinies. Wherever they are born, their sins and suffering follow them. Therefore it is said, Seeking happiness for oneself in this life, one does not attain happiness in the next world.

All sentient beings crave happiness and dislike suffering. Seeing those who suffer, they give rise to a compassionate mind. With the four universal virtues, they view others as their own children. They never give rise to resentment or beat sentient beings. In the world, they all seek to secure their own bodies.

Therefore it is said, Those who protect the Dharma and practice the Dharma, those who practice the Dharma and obtain good rewards.
['ZH_T04_0212_027:0753c05_20']	此應法律教，行法不趣惡者，彼執行人以法自護，所生之中不遇惡災，從小至大悉受其對，天受福盡下生人間復重受福，是故說曰，此應法律教，行法不趣惡也。	此應法律教，行法不趣惡者，彼執行人以法自護，所生之中不遇惡災，從小至大悉受其對，天受福盡下生人間復重受福，是故說曰，此應法律教，行法不趣惡也。	027	As for this accords with the teachings of the Dharma, practicing the Dharma does not lead to evil, those who practice in accordance with the Dharma protect themselves with the Dharma.
