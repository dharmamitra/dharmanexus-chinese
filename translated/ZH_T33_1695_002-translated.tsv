['ZH_T33_1695_002:0037a21_12']	然第五天業既殊勝，則不如是隨欲化物，但以生得變化之力，變作種種所須之具而受用之。	然第五天業既殊勝，則不如是隨欲化物，但以生得變化之力，變作種種所須之具而受用之。	However, since the karma of the fifth heaven is already superior, it is not like this in freely transforming things according to desire, but rather uses the power of innate transformation to transform various necessary implements and enjoy them.
['ZH_T33_1695_002:0037a24_6']	今第六天業更殊勝，雖有眾具隨欲即現，亦能自變化作眾具而不受用，要待他天變為樂具自方受用，業力勝故。	今第六天業更殊勝，雖有眾具隨欲即現，亦能自變化作眾具而不受用，要待他天變為樂具自方受用，業力勝故。	Now, the actions of the sixth heaven are even more superior.

The sutra further says in the palace of the heavenly king to show that the Dharma is honored and must be expounded in the most supreme place, not in other inferior places.
['ZH_T33_1695_002:0037a29_7']	如證菩提要金剛座，說此勝法必他化宮，如《十地經》依勝處也。	如證菩提要金剛座，說此勝法必他化宮，如《十地經》依勝處也。	Just as attaining enlightenment must be at the Diamond Seat, expounding this supreme Dharma must be in the palace of the Heaven of Controlling Others' Emanations, like the Sutra on the Ten Grounds expounding in a superior place.

Since it is the common path of the sages, it is known to be a superior place.

It also shows that the buddhas all reside together and praise it equally, so it is known to be a superior place.
['ZH_T33_1695_002:0037b24_10']	佛受用身住報土及後得智分別法性義名為遊，無分別智住法性土遊戲如理號為處，由受用土具十八德、法性之土具含萬善，所以諸佛常共讚歎此二土故，名共稱美。	佛受用身住報土及後得智分別法性義名為遊，無分別智住法性土遊戲如理號為處，由受用土具十八德、法性之土具含萬善，所以諸佛常共讚歎此二土故，名共稱美。	The Buddha's enjoyment body abides in the reward land and the subsequently attained wisdom distinguishes the meaning of the nature of dharmas, which is called roaming. The nondiscriminating wisdom abides in the land of the nature of dharmas and plays according to principle, which is called dwelling. Because the reward land is endowed with eighteen virtues and the land of the nature of dharmas contains myriad wholesome dharmas, the buddhas always praise these two lands together, so it is called praising together.
