['ZH_T43_1833_06b:0938b08_3']	既云如是四緣依十五處義有差別建立十因。	既云如是四緣依十五處義有差別建立十因。	Since it is said that the four conditions are established based on the fifteen bases with distinctions in meaning,
['ZH_T43_1833_06b:0938b08_17']	云何此緣依處立因　有義斷云。	云何此緣依處立因　有義斷云。	how are the conditions established based on the bases? There is an interpretation that refutes this.
