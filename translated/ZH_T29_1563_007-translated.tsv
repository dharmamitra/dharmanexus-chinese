['ZH_T29_1563_007:0804c27_2']	性差別者，一切非得皆唯無覆無記性攝。	性差別者，一切非得皆唯無覆無記性攝。	007	As for the distinction of natures, all non-acquisitions are exclusively categorized as the nature of undefiled indeterminate dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0804c28_15']	世差別者，過去未來各有三種，謂過去法及未來法，一一各有三世非得；	世差別者，過去未來各有三種，謂過去法及未來法，一一各有三世非得；	007	As for the distinction of time periods, each of the past and future has three kinds. That is to say, each of past dharmas and future dharmas has the non-acquisition of the three time periods.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0804c29_10']	若現在法，唯有過去未來非得。	若現在法，唯有過去未來非得。	007	If it is a present dharma, it only has the past and future non-acquisition.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a02_8']	有說現法無現非得，性相違故。	有說現法無現非得，性相違故。	007	Some say that present dharmas have no present non-acquisition, because their natures are mutually exclusive.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a04_2']	現可成法必與得俱定無非得，不可成法非得亦無，故現在法無現非得。	現可成法必與得俱定無非得，不可成法非得亦無，故現在法無現非得。	007	Present dharmas that can be accomplished are necessarily concomitant with acquisition and definitely have no non-acquisition. Dharmas that cannot be accomplished also have no non-acquisition. Therefore, present dharmas have no present non-acquisition.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a06_4']	界差別者，三界繫法及不繫法各三非得，謂欲界繫法有三界非得，色無色界繫及不繫亦爾。	界差別者，三界繫法及不繫法各三非得，謂欲界繫法有三界非得，色無色界繫及不繫亦爾。	007	As for the distinction of realms, dharmas belonging to the three realms and unconditioned dharmas each have three kinds of non-acquisition. That is to say, dharmas belonging to the desire realm have non-acquisition belonging to the three realms. The same is true for dharmas belonging to the form and formless realms and for unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a06_13']	定無非得是無漏者。	定無非得是無漏者。	007	There definitely is no non-acquisition that is pure.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a08_9']	謂不獲聖法。	謂不獲聖法。	007	It is the non-attainment of the dharmas of the noble ones.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a09_9']	不獲即是非得異名，如何無漏法可名異生性。	不獲即是非得異名，如何無漏法可名異生性。	007	Non-attainment is a synonym for non-acquisition. How can pure dharmas be called the nature of an ordinary person?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a10_2']	不獲何聖法名異生性耶？	不獲何聖法名異生性耶？	007	What dharmas of the noble ones are not attained called the nature of an ordinary person?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a11_1']	為總不獲一切聖法、為唯不獲苦法智忍？	為總不獲一切聖法、為唯不獲苦法智忍？	007	Is it the general non-attainment of all dharmas of the noble ones, or is it only the non-attainment of the receptivity to the cognition of the dharma of suffering?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a11_10']	有說不獲一切聖法。	有說不獲一切聖法。	007	Some say: It is the non-acquisition of all noble dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a12_10']	若爾，豈不無非異生，無一總成就一切聖法故。	若爾，豈不無非異生，無一總成就一切聖法故。	007	If so, wouldn't there be no non-ordinary beings, because there is no one who generally possesses all noble dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a13_19']	若有不獲不雜於獲是異生性，若雜獲者非異生性，故無有失。	若有不獲不雜於獲是異生性，若雜獲者非異生性，故無有失。	007	If there is non-acquisition that is not mixed with acquisition, that is the nature of an ordinary being. If it is mixed with acquisition, it is not the nature of an ordinary being. Therefore there is no error.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a14_9']	若爾，本論應說純言。	若爾，本論應說純言。	007	If so, the original treatise should speak of pure [non-acquisition].
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a14_19']	不爾，離言見義有故。	不爾，離言見義有故。	007	No, because the meaning of the term is seen to exist.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a16_7']	如說此類食水食風，雖無純言，而亦知彼純食水風，不雜餘故。	如說此類食水食風，雖無純言，而亦知彼純食水風，不雜餘故。	007	Just as it is said that this class of beings eats water and eats wind. Although there is no pure [eating], it is also known that they purely eat water and wind, because it is not mixed with anything else.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a17_14']	有說不獲苦法智忍，然非後捨復成異生，前已永害彼非得故。	有說不獲苦法智忍，然非後捨復成異生，前已永害彼非得故。	007	Some say: It is the non-acquisition of the receptivity to the knowledge of the factors of the path of seeing. However, after abandoning it, one does not again become an ordinary being, because one has already permanently destroyed that non-acquisition.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a18_8']	何緣故知別有實法說名非得？	何緣故知別有實法說名非得？	007	What is the reason for knowing that there is a separate real dharma called non-acquisition?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a19_2']	以契經中說有成就、不成就故。	以契經中說有成就、不成就故。	007	Because a scripture says there is possession and non-possession.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a19_7']	如契經言：	如契經言：	007	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a20_3']	若成就六法，不成就順忍，六法如經。	若成就六法，不成就順忍，六法如經。	007	If one possesses six dharmas, one does not possess receptivity. The six dharmas are as in the sutra.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a21_7']	若謂未生聖法眼等相續分位名異生性，彼違契經。	若謂未生聖法眼等相續分位名異生性，彼違契經。	007	If you say that the state of the continuity of the eye and so on prior to the arising of the holy dharmas is called the nature of an ordinary man, then you are in conflict with the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a21_12']	如世尊說：	如世尊說：	007	As the World Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a22_12']	如是名為隨信行者入正性離生，超越異生地。	如是名為隨信行者入正性離生，超越異生地。	007	This is called the faith-follower entering the correct detachment from the stage of ordinary men and transcending the stage of ordinary men.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a23_2']	此異生地即異生性。	此異生地即異生性。	007	This stage of ordinary men is precisely the nature of an ordinary man.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a23_7']	何緣故知？	何緣故知？	007	Why do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a23_12']	如得捨故。	如得捨故。	007	Because it is like obtaining and abandoning.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a28_6']	如得異法故名為入，應捨異法故名為超，非於爾時捨曾所得眼等諸法少分可知，如得未曾所得聖法，故不可謂未生聖法眼等相續即異生性，故別有法唯異生有、遍諸異生、違聖道得，名異生性，其理必然。	如得異法故名為入，應捨異法故名為超，非於爾時捨曾所得眼等諸法少分可知，如得未曾所得聖法，故不可謂未生聖法眼等相續即異生性，故別有法唯異生有、遍諸異生、違聖道得，名異生性，其理必然。	007	Just as one is said to enter because one obtains a different dharma, one is said to transcend because one abandons a different dharma. At that time, one cannot be said to abandon even a small part of the dharmas such as the eye that one has already obtained, just as one cannot be said to obtain the holy dharmas that one has not yet obtained. Therefore, one cannot say that the continuity of the eye and so on prior to the arising of the holy dharmas is the nature of an ordinary man. Therefore, the principle is certain that there is a separate dharma that only ordinary men have, that pervades all ordinary men, and that conflicts with the attainment of the holy path, and it is called the nature of an ordinary man.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805a29_6']	豈不如聖法即說是聖性，成就此性故名聖者；	豈不如聖法即說是聖性，成就此性故名聖者；	007	Isn't it just like saying that the holy dharmas themselves are the holy nature, and because one accomplishes this nature one is called a holy one;
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b01_7']	如是異生法應即異生性，成就此性故名異生。	如是異生法應即異生性，成就此性故名異生。	007	Thus, the nature of ordinary beings should be the dharmas of ordinary beings, because one is called an ordinary being because one possesses this nature.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b02_11']	此例不然，以諸聖法唯聖者有，可即聖法說為聖性。	此例不然，以諸聖法唯聖者有，可即聖法說為聖性。	007	This example is not correct, because only noble ones have the dharmas of noble ones, so the dharmas of noble ones can be called the nature of noble ones.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b03_10']	諸異生法聖者亦有，如何可立為異生性？	諸異生法聖者亦有，如何可立為異生性？	007	But the dharmas of ordinary beings are also possessed by noble ones, so how can they be established as the nature of ordinary beings?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b04_9']	若異生法唯異生成、遍異生位，可異生性；	若異生法唯異生成、遍異生位，可異生性；	007	If the dharmas of ordinary beings are only produced by ordinary beings and are universal in the state of ordinary beings, then they can be the nature of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b05_16']	惡趣、無想、北俱盧等不遍異生，餘命根等雖遍異生而聖亦有。	惡趣、無想、北俱盧等不遍異生，餘命根等雖遍異生而聖亦有。	007	But the evil destinies, the unconscious state, and the northern continent of Kuru are not universal to ordinary beings. Other things such as the faculty of life are universal to ordinary beings, but noble ones also possess them.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b07_1']	傍論已了，今更應思如是非得，何時當捨此法非得？	傍論已了，今更應思如是非得，何時當捨此法非得？	007	The subsidiary discussion is now complete. We should now consider when one abandons the non-acquisition of a dharma.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b07_15']	得此法時，或轉易地捨此非得。	得此法時，或轉易地捨此非得。	007	When one acquires a dharma, or when one changes to a different stage, one abandons the non-acquisition.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b08_17']	如聖法非得說名異生性，隨得聖法時捨三界非得。	如聖法非得說名異生性，隨得聖法時捨三界非得。	007	Just as the non-acquisition of the dharmas of noble ones is called the nature of ordinary beings, when one acquires the dharmas of noble ones, one abandons the non-acquisition of the three realms.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b11_9']	如是住初無漏心者，於苦法智展轉乃至住金剛喻三摩地者，於阿羅漢所有非得，如其所應隨得此法捨此非得。	如是住初無漏心者，於苦法智展轉乃至住金剛喻三摩地者，於阿羅漢所有非得，如其所應隨得此法捨此非得。	007	When one abides in the first pure mind, from the cognition of the factors of suffering, and so on, up to abiding in the vajra-like samādhi, the non-possession of the arhat is relinquished as appropriate upon obtaining this dharma.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b13_7']	如是乃至阿羅漢果時解脫者，於阿羅漢不時解脫所有非得，得此法時捨此非得。	如是乃至阿羅漢果時解脫者，於阿羅漢不時解脫所有非得，得此法時捨此非得。	007	In this way, up to the time when one attains the fruit of arhatship, the non-possession of the arhat who is liberated at the proper time is relinquished upon obtaining this dharma.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b13_16']	餘法非得類此應思。	餘法非得類此應思。	007	The non-possession of other dharmas should be considered in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b14_6']	又此非得云何名捨？	又此非得云何名捨？	007	Moreover, how is this non-possession called relinquishment?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b15_7']	若非得得斷非得非得生，如是名為捨於非得。	若非得得斷非得非得生，如是名為捨於非得。	007	When the possession of non-possession is severed and the non-possession of non-possession arises, this is called relinquishing non-possession.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b17_15']	得與非得雖各有餘，得及非得然非無窮，由得勢力成就本法及與得得，得得勢力成就法得，豈成無窮？	得與非得雖各有餘，得及非得然非無窮，由得勢力成就本法及與得得，得得勢力成就法得，豈成無窮？	007	Although possession and non-possession each have other [possessions and non-possessions], possession and non-possession are not endless. By the power of possession, the fundamental dharma and the possession of possession are accomplished. The power of the possession of possession accomplishes the possession of the dharma. How can it be endless?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b18_5']	非得亦應如理思擇。	非得亦應如理思擇。	007	Non-possession should also be considered in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b18_14']	非得非得必不俱生。	非得非得必不俱生。	007	The non-possession of non-possession definitely does not arise together.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b19_13']	又從下地生上地時，下地非得一切皆捨。	又從下地生上地時，下地非得一切皆捨。	007	Also, when one is born in a higher stage from a lower stage, the non-acquisition of the lower stage is completely abandoned.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b20_12']	從上生下類此應知，由所依力非得轉故。	從上生下類此應知，由所依力非得轉故。	007	When one is born in a lower stage from a higher stage, it should be understood in the same way. Because the power of the support causes the non-acquisition to change.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b21_2']	如是已辯得非得相。	如是已辯得非得相。	007	Thus the characteristics of acquisition and non-acquisition have been explained.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b27_19']	如鮮淨色，業心大種皆是其因，故身形等非唯因業。	如鮮淨色，業心大種皆是其因，故身形等非唯因業。	007	Just as the fresh and pure color is caused by karma, mind, and the four great elements, therefore form, etc. are not only caused by karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805b29_7']	現見身形是互相似業所引果，諸根作用及飲食等有差別故。	現見身形是互相似業所引果，諸根作用及飲食等有差別故。	007	It is seen that form is the result of karma that attracts mutual similarity, because faculties, activities, food, etc. have differences.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805c01_8']	若謂滿業有差別故此差別者，理不應然。	若謂滿業有差別故此差別者，理不應然。	007	If you say that the difference is due to the difference in the full complement of karma, this is not reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805c02_15']	或有身形唯由相似引業所起，以眾同分有差別故作用等別。	或有身形唯由相似引業所起，以眾同分有差別故作用等別。	007	Or, the form of the body is produced only by the similar projecting karma, because the commonality of the aggregates has differences. Therefore, the differences in function, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805c04_6']	若身形等唯業果者，隨其所樂作用等事，若捨若行，應不得有。	若身形等唯業果者，隨其所樂作用等事，若捨若行，應不得有。	007	If the form of the body, etc. were only the result of karma, then the matter of function, etc. as desired, whether abandoned or undertaken, would not exist.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805c05_8']	此中身形作用樂欲展轉相似，故名為同分是因義。	此中身形作用樂欲展轉相似，故名為同分是因義。	007	In this case, the form of the body, function, and desires are mutually similar, and therefore called commonality. This is the meaning of cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805c06_3']	有別實物是此同因，故名同分。	有別實物是此同因，故名同分。	007	There is a separate real entity that is the common cause of this, and therefore it is called commonality.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0805c10_1']	就界趣生處身等別，有無量種有情同分。	就界趣生處身等別，有無量種有情同分。	007	There are innumerable kinds of commonality of sentient beings, distinguished by realm, destination, rebirth, body, etc.

It is possible that they, in the present life or at the time of death, are unable to diligently cultivate and perfect their understanding. From the disintegration of this body, they transcend the heavens that consume solid food and receive a body made of mind in one of the heavens. Having been born there, they repeatedly enter and emerge from the samādhi of the cessation of feeling and conceptualization.

That is, feeling and conceptualization are the supports of the defilements of views and craving, and for that reason one is disgusted with and opposes them.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a07_14']	如是二法多諸過患，如立蘊中已廣分別，故偏厭逆入滅盡定。	如是二法多諸過患，如立蘊中已廣分別，故偏厭逆入滅盡定。	007	These two dharmas are full of faults, as has been extensively discussed in the chapter on the aggregates. Therefore one is disgusted with and opposes them and enters the samādhi of cessation.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a09_3']	如契經說：	如契經說：	007	As a scripture says,

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a12_15']	此經俱言顯同時起，蘆束相依為譬喻故，說心心所生緣等故。	此經俱言顯同時起，蘆束相依為譬喻故，說心心所生緣等故。	007	The word “together” in the scripture indicates that the two are born simultaneously, because the example of the bundle of reeds shows that they support each other, and because it is said that mind and mental activities are born with the same objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a13_14']	非此定中唯想受滅，此中亦說意行滅故。	非此定中唯想受滅，此中亦說意行滅故。	007	It is not the case that only feeling and conceptualization cease in this samādhi, because it is also said that intention and conceptualization cease.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a15_3']	若此定中心不滅者，想受二種亦應不滅，能生彼觸應亦有故。	若此定中心不滅者，想受二種亦應不滅，能生彼觸應亦有故。	007	If mind does not cease in this samādhi, then feeling and conceptualization also should not cease, because the contact that generates them would also exist.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a15_12']	由此滅定必無有心。	由此滅定必無有心。	007	Therefore this samādhi definitely does not have mind.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a18_8']	滅盡定體應知實有，能遮礙心令不生故。	滅盡定體應知實有，能遮礙心令不生故。	007	You should understand that the substance of this samādhi really exists, because it is able to block the arising of mind.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a20_11']	若謂有根身能起餘心者，應一切時諸識頓起。	若謂有根身能起餘心者，應一切時諸識頓起。	007	If it is argued that the body with organs can give rise to other minds, then all consciousnesses would arise simultaneously at all times.

Even though there is a simultaneous support and object, all objects and consciousness do not arise simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a24_6']	若執不待自類因緣待有根身識便起者，彼一切位一切境識，何法為礙起不同時？	若執不待自類因緣待有根身識便起者，彼一切位一切境識，何法為礙起不同時？	007	If you insist that consciousness arises in dependence on the presence of a body with organs and not in dependence on a similar and immediately antecedent condition of its own, then in all states of existence, what prevents all consciousness of all objects from arising simultaneously?
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a24_15']	是故唯應依心心起。	是故唯應依心心起。	007	Therefore, consciousness must arise in dependence on mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a25_7']	非前定心力能遮礙餘心。	非前定心力能遮礙餘心。	007	The power of the mind in samādhi cannot prevent other minds from arising.

Because of this dharma, even though there is a cause of mind in the state of non-mind, mind does not arise. This separate dharma is called samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808a28_4']	體是有為，實而非假。	體是有為，實而非假。	007	Its substance is conditioned, real, and not provisional.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808b01_12']	脩觀行者由定前心要期願力所引發故，令滅盡定勢力漸微，至都盡位無遮礙用，意法為緣還生意識。	脩觀行者由定前心要期願力所引發故，令滅盡定勢力漸微，至都盡位無遮礙用，意法為緣還生意識。	007	Because it is attracted and produced by the power of the mind in samādhi prior to the state of cessation, the power of samādhi of cessation gradually diminishes until it is completely exhausted and has no more function of preventing the arising of mind. Then, with mind and dharmas as conditions, manas consciousness arises again.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808b02_6']	由此准釋前無想定及與無想。	由此准釋前無想定及與無想。	007	Therefore, by analogy, we explain the previous two concentrations of non-perception and non-discrimination.

Therefore, they are called characteristics. Based on this, there are various types of conditioned phenomena.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808c07_1']	此中生者，謂有別法，是行生位無障勝因，由能引攝令其生故。	此中生者，謂有別法，是行生位無障勝因，由能引攝令其生故。	007	Among them, arising refers to a separate dharma that is the supreme cause without obstruction in the state of arising of conditioned phenomena. Because it can attract and bring about their arising.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808c10_17']	雖諸行起皆得名生，然此生名但依諸行生位無障勝因而立諸行，必藉前生俱生同類異類緣力故起，思因果中當廣顯示。	雖諸行起皆得名生，然此生名但依諸行生位無障勝因而立諸行，必藉前生俱生同類異類緣力故起，思因果中當廣顯示。	007	Although the arising of conditioned phenomena can all be called arising, this term arising is established only based on the supreme cause without obstruction in the state of arising of conditioned phenomena. Because conditioned phenomena arise due to the power of causes and conditions that arise before, arise simultaneously, are of the same type, or are of different types, this will be extensively explained in the chapter on causes and effects.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808c13_14']	前生同類異類緣中，同類緣強隨彼起故，俱生緣內無同類緣，異類緣中有偏勝者，如緣眼色眼識生中說眼為因、色為緣性。	前生同類異類緣中，同類緣強隨彼起故，俱生緣內無同類緣，異類緣中有偏勝者，如緣眼色眼識生中說眼為因、色為緣性。	007	Among similar and dissimilar conditions in previous lives, similar conditions are stronger because they arise following them. Within the condition of simultaneous arising, there are no similar conditions. Among dissimilar conditions, there are those that are particularly superior. For example, in the arising of eye consciousness conditioned by eye and form, the eye is said to be the cause and form is said to be the condition.

Because it is the proximate condition, it is said to be the cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808c16_4']	眼識俱生一果諸法，為緣助識力勝非眼。	眼識俱生一果諸法，為緣助識力勝非眼。	007	The various dharmas of one fruit simultaneously arising with eye consciousness assist the power of consciousness, which is superior to the eye.

For example, wind assists the power of fire, causing it to blaze. Because this is well established in the world,
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808c19_19']	現見異聚風偏順火，故可比度同聚必然，是故俱生諸行緣內生力勝者，偏立生名。	現見異聚風偏順火，故可比度同聚必然，是故俱生諸行緣內生力勝者，偏立生名。	007	it is directly perceived that wind in a different aggregate is particularly conducive to fire. Therefore, it can be inferred that in the same aggregate, it is necessarily so. Therefore, among the conditions of simultaneous arising, those whose power of arising is superior are unilaterally established as the name of arising.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808c20_17']	此生功能，於生初念無漏諸得其相最顯。	此生功能，於生初念無漏諸得其相最顯。	007	The function of this arising is most evident in the initial moment of arising of the various attainments of the uncontaminated.

['ZH_T29_1563_007:0808c24_7']	如諸行生，必待別法為勝因助引果勝用，亦應必待別法為因。	如諸行生，必待別法為勝因助引果勝用，亦應必待別法為因。	007	Just as the production of conditioned forces must depend on a separate dharma as a superior cause that assists in leading to the fruit, so too must it depend on a separate dharma as a cause.

This is not established by reason, and therefore there must be a separate dharma that is the proximate cause that is not an obstacle to the activity of projecting results of the various conditioned forces. The Abhidharma masters say that this is duration.

It cannot be that there is no cause for dissimilarity, and that there is naturally dissimilarity. The succession of similar moments of consciousness cannot be without a cause for transformation, because this is not established by reason.

If it were not so, it would only say change, in order to show that conditioned dharmas have change, unlike unconditioned dharmas which have abiding but no change.

Unconditioned dharmas have abiding but not the other three. Therefore conditioned dharmas are different from unconditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_007:0809a24_6']	由斯對法說諸有為定有四相，理無傾動。	由斯對法說諸有為定有四相，理無傾動。	007	Therefore the Abhidharma says that conditioned dharmas definitely have four characteristics, and this principle is unshakable.
