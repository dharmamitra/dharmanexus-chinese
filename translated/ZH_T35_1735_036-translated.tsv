['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a09_15']	又前三地寄同世間施戒修法，前二施戒竟，今此顯修，故《深密》云「前位能持微細戒品，未得圓滿世間等持等至，及圓滿聞法總持，為令得此，因說此地令勤修學。	又前三地寄同世間施戒修法，前二施戒竟，今此顯修，故《深密》云「前位能持微細戒品，未得圓滿世間等持等至，及圓滿聞法總持，為令得此，因說此地令勤修學。	036	Moreover, the first three grounds are provisionally the same as the worldly dharmas of giving, precepts, and meditation. The previous two on giving and precepts have been completed, and now this chapter shows meditation. Therefore, the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra says, The previous stage can uphold the subtle precepts, but has not yet attained the perfect worldly samādhis and samāpattis, as well as the perfect Dharma-hearing dhāraṇī. In order to attain these, it causes one to diligently cultivate and study this ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a10_4']	」此則具前二意。	」此則具前二意。	036	This then fulfills the previous two meanings.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a12_13']	言發光者，《智論》四十九名為光地，本論及《金光明》、《十住婆沙》等皆名明地，光之與明眼目殊稱，皆略無發字。	言發光者，《智論》四十九名為光地，本論及《金光明》、《十住婆沙》等皆名明地，光之與明眼目殊稱，皆略無發字。	036	As for radiant light, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra, number forty-nine, calls it the ground of light. The root treatise, the Suvarṇa-prabhāsa-sūtra, the Daśabhūmika-vibhāṣā, and others all call it the ground of brightness. Light and brightness are different names for the eyes, and they all omit the character radiant.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a13_11']	《仁王》名明慧，慧亦是明，義旨皆同。	《仁王》名明慧，慧亦是明，義旨皆同。	036	The Suvarṇa-prabhāsa-sūtra calls it the wisdom of brightness. Wisdom is also brightness. The meanings are all the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a14_10']	今統收下經及諸經論，總有三義立發光名：	今統收下經及諸經論，總有三義立發光名：	036	Now, comprehensively collecting the sutra below and various sutras and treatises, there are a total of three meanings for establishing the name Illumination:
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a16_10']	一以初住地十種淨心為能發，勝定聞持為所發光，以安住地竟方始聞法修得定故。	一以初住地十種淨心為能發，勝定聞持為所發光，以安住地竟方始聞法修得定故。	036	First, taking the ten kinds of pure mind of the initial stage of abiding as the illuminator, and the light of superior concentration and dhāraṇī as the illuminated light, because after completing the stage of abiding one begins to hear the Dharma and cultivate concentration.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a18_6']	故《瑜伽》四十八云「由聞行正法，光明等持，光明之所顯示故，名發光地。	故《瑜伽》四十八云「由聞行正法，光明等持，光明之所顯示故，名發光地。	036	Therefore, the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, fascicle forty-eight, says: Because of the light of hearing and practicing the correct Dharma, and the light of samādhi, it is called the Ground of Radiance.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a19_5']	由內心淨，能發光明，是故說名增上心住。	由內心淨，能發光明，是故說名增上心住。	036	Because of the purity of the inner mind, one is able to emit light. Therefore, it is called the abode of superior mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a20_7']	」既言由內心淨能發明，知以十淨心為能發也。	」既言由內心淨能發明，知以十淨心為能發也。	036	Since it says that because of the purity of the inner mind one is able to emit light, it is known that the ten pure minds are the illuminator.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a21_1']	《攝論》、《金光明經》意皆同此。	《攝論》、《金光明經》意皆同此。	036	The meaning of the Mahāyānasaṃgraha and the Suvarṇa-prabhāsa-sūtra are all the same as this.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a22_9']	二以聞持為能發、勝定為所發，以聞法竟靜處修行方發定故。	二以聞持為能發、勝定為所發，以聞法竟靜處修行方發定故。	036	Second, taking dhāraṇī as the illuminator and superior concentration as the illuminated, because after hearing the Dharma one practices in a quiet place and then gives rise to concentration.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a23_3']	《瑜伽》亦說等持為光明故。	《瑜伽》亦說等持為光明故。	036	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra also says that samādhi is light.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a23_10']	此約地中釋之。	此約地中釋之。	036	This is explained in terms of the stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a25_12']	三以勝定總持並為能發，彼四地證光明相以為所發，故下論云「彼無生慧，此名光明。	三以勝定總持並為能發，彼四地證光明相以為所發，故下論云「彼無生慧，此名光明。	036	Third, the superior samādhi and dhāraṇī are both the means of development, and the four stages of realizing the characteristics of light are what is developed. Therefore, the treatise below says, The wisdom of non-arising is called light.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a26_2']	依此光明，故名明地。	依此光明，故名明地。	036	Relying on this light, it is called the ground of brightness.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a26_9']	」此約地滿釋。	」此約地滿釋。	036	This is explained in terms of the completion of the stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a27_12']	《唯識》亦云「成就勝定大法總持，能發無邊妙慧光故。	《唯識》亦云「成就勝定大法總持，能發無邊妙慧光故。	036	The Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi also says, Accomplishing the superior samādhi and the great Dharma dhāraṇī, one is able to emit the light of boundless wondrous wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779a28_15']	」謂由得勝定發修慧光，由得總持教法發聞思光。	」謂由得勝定發修慧光，由得總持教法發聞思光。	036	This means that by attaining the superior samādhi, one emits the light of cultivated wisdom, and by attaining the dhāraṇī, one emits the light of hearing and contemplating the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b02_17']	彼無邊慧即是三慧，故上本分論云「隨聞思修照法顯現」，謂就此慧中，四地證法為所照、三慧光明為能照，三慧是彼證智光明之相。	彼無邊慧即是三慧，故上本分論云「隨聞思修照法顯現」，謂就此慧中，四地證法為所照、三慧光明為能照，三慧是彼證智光明之相。	036	That boundless wisdom is precisely the three kinds of wisdom. Therefore, the treatise on the original chapter above says, According to hearing, contemplating, and cultivating, the Dharma appears illuminated. This means that in this wisdom, the Dharma realized in the four stages is what is illuminated, and the light of the three kinds of wisdom is what illuminates. The three kinds of wisdom are the characteristics of the light of the wisdom of realization.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b05_13']	餘諸經論言雖少異，並不出此，故十淨心唯是能發、證光明相唯是所發，勝定一種通能所發，是以此地偏得增上心名。	餘諸經論言雖少異，並不出此，故十淨心唯是能發、證光明相唯是所發，勝定一種通能所發，是以此地偏得增上心名。	036	Although the words of other scriptures and treatises differ somewhat, they do not go beyond this. Therefore, the ten pure minds are only that which can give rise to light, and the characteristics of the light of realization are only that which is given rise to. The one kind of superior samādhi is both that which can give rise to and that which is given rise to. For this reason, this ground is given the name of superior mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b07_3']	若所離障，通約三慧，故本分論云「闇相，於聞思修諸法忘障。	若所離障，通約三慧，故本分論云「闇相，於聞思修諸法忘障。	036	If the obstacles to be eliminated are generally discussed in terms of the three kinds of wisdom, then the treatise on the chapter on the fundamental stage says: The characteristic of darkness is the obstacle of forgetting the various dharmas of hearing, thinking, and cultivation.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b08_10']	」《唯識》名闇鈍障，謂所知障中俱生一分，令聞思修法忘失。	」《唯識》名闇鈍障，謂所知障中俱生一分，令聞思修法忘失。	036	The Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi-śāstra calls it the obstacle of dullness and sluggishness. It means that among the obstacles to that which is to be known, one part that is innate causes one to forget the dharmas of hearing, thinking, and cultivation.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b10_1']	彼障三地勝定總持，及彼所發殊勝三慧，入三地時便能永斷。	彼障三地勝定總持，及彼所發殊勝三慧，入三地時便能永斷。	036	That obstacle obstructs the superior samādhi and dhāraṇīs of the three grounds, as well as the superior three wisdoms that they give rise to. Upon entering the third ground, one is able to permanently eliminate them.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b10_14']	由斯三地說斷二愚及彼麁重：	由斯三地說斷二愚及彼麁重：	036	Because of this, the third ground is said to eliminate two kinds of delusions and their coarseness.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b11_10']	一欲貪愚，此障勝定及彼修慧；	一欲貪愚，此障勝定及彼修慧；	036	The first is the delusion of desire and greed. This obstructs superior samādhi and the wisdom of cultivation.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b12_14']	二圓滿陀羅尼愚，此障聞思慧，及障彼圓滿陀羅尼故。	二圓滿陀羅尼愚，此障聞思慧，及障彼圓滿陀羅尼故。	036	The second is the delusion of perfecting dhāraṇīs. This obstructs the wisdom of hearing and thinking, as well as the perfection of dhāraṇīs.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b13_12']	若約所證，唯就總持名證勝流真如。	若約所證，唯就總持名證勝流真如。	036	If it is in terms of what is realized, it is only in terms of the total retention that it is called the realization of the supreme flow true suchness.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b14_15']	《唯識》云「謂此真如所流教法，於餘教法極為勝故。	《唯識》云「謂此真如所流教法，於餘教法極為勝故。	036	The Vijñaptimātratā says: It means that the teachings that flow from this true suchness are extremely supreme among other teachings.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b17_6']	」梁《攝論》云「從真如流出正體智，正體智流出後得智，後得智流出大悲，大悲流出十二部經，名為勝流法界。	」梁《攝論》云「從真如流出正體智，正體智流出後得智，後得智流出大悲，大悲流出十二部經，名為勝流法界。	036	The Liang dynasty's Compendium Treatise says: From true suchness flows the fundamental wisdom, from the fundamental wisdom flows the subsequently attained wisdom, from the subsequently attained wisdom flows great compassion, and from great compassion flow the twelve divisions of the scriptures, which are called the supreme flowing dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b18_2']	」故下經中能捨身命求此善說。	」故下經中能捨身命求此善說。	036	Therefore, in the sutra below, one is able to give up one's body and life to seek this good teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b18_14']	其所成行，亦唯禪及求法。	其所成行，亦唯禪及求法。	036	The practices one accomplishes are also only meditation and seeking the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b19_3']	其所得果，亦法及禪。	其所得果，亦法及禪。	036	The fruits one attains are also the Dharma and meditation.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b20_3']	梁《攝論》云「通達勝流法界，得無邊法音果。	梁《攝論》云「通達勝流法界，得無邊法音果。	036	The Liang dynasty's Compendium Treatise says: Penetrating the supreme flowing dharma realm, one attains the fruit of boundless Dharma sounds.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779b20_22']	」《金光明》云「三地發心得難動三昧果。	」《金光明》云「三地發心得難動三昧果。	036	The Suvarṇa-prabhāsa says: On the third ground, one gives rise to the mind and attains the immovable samādhi fruit.

['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779c15_4']	初中標起云十種深心，論經云深念心，則異前二地單云深心，謂更以十心念前十深心故。	初中標起云十種深心，論經云深念心，則異前二地單云深心，謂更以十心念前十深心故。	036	In the first section, it is stated that there are ten kinds of profound minds. The treatise's sūtra says profoundly contemplating mind, which is different from the single mention of profound mind in the previous two stages, meaning that it further uses ten minds to contemplate the previous ten profound minds.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779c17_14']	《瑜伽》云「若菩薩先於增上戒住已得十種清淨意樂，復由餘十淨心意樂作意思惟成上品故，入增上心住。	《瑜伽》云「若菩薩先於增上戒住已得十種清淨意樂，復由餘十淨心意樂作意思惟成上品故，入增上心住。	036	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says: If a bodhisattva has already attained the ten kinds of pure intentions in the stage of superior precepts, and further, by means of the ten pure mental intentions and thought, he accomplishes the superior stage and enters the stage of superior mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0779c20_5']	」二徵列中十心，義分四對，初二一對根本建立、次三一對方便發修、次三一對修已成就、後二一對德用自在。	」二徵列中十心，義分四對，初二一對根本建立、次三一對方便發修、次三一對修已成就、後二一對德用自在。	036	In the second section on listing the ten minds, the meaning is divided into four pairs: the first two are a pair of fundamental establishment, the next three are a pair of expedient development of practice, the next three are a pair of accomplishment of practice, and the last two are a pair of mastery of virtuous functions.

['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a12_7']	三以聞慧為彼中間起行所依，名彼起依止行，以其聞慧未是證行，不得名起，而忘軀求聞亦得稱行。	三以聞慧為彼中間起行所依，名彼起依止行，以其聞慧未是證行，不得名起，而忘軀求聞亦得稱行。	036	Third, much learning is the basis for the practice that arises from them in the middle, called the practice of the basis for their arising, because much learning is not yet the practice of realization and cannot be called arising, but seeking learning by forgetting the body is also called practice.

['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a15_10']	一佛智名無障礙解脫者，無二障故，是離障解脫，具十智力權實無礙，故是作用解脫，此是究竟攝生方便。	一佛智名無障礙解脫者，無二障故，是離障解脫，具十智力權實無礙，故是作用解脫，此是究竟攝生方便。	036	The first, the Buddha's wisdom called unobstructed liberation, is due to the absence of the two hindrances, which is the liberation from hindrances. Equipped with the ten powers of wisdom, it is unobstructed in terms of skillful means and reality, thus it is the liberation of function. This is the ultimate skillful means for embracing sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a16_17']	二此智要依如實覺者，八地得無生忍，覺一切法如實性故。	二此智要依如實覺者，八地得無生忍，覺一切法如實性故。	036	The second, this wisdom must rely on the realization of suchness, because at the eighth ground one attains the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas and realizes the suchness of all dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a18_1']	若覺實性方能盡惑，於事理無礙故，佛智由起。	若覺實性方能盡惑，於事理無礙故，佛智由起。	036	If one realizes suchness, one can then exhaust afflictions, because one is unobstructed in terms of phenomena and principles. Thus, the Buddha's wisdom arises.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a19_16']	論釋一切法云如來所說一切法者，因音聲忍方得無生，尋於能詮悟所詮故。	論釋一切法云如來所說一切法者，因音聲忍方得無生，尋於能詮悟所詮故。	036	The treatise explains that all dharmas are what the Tathāgata speaks of. One attains the acceptance of sounds and then attains non-arising, because one seeks to understand the meaning that is being conveyed through the words.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a21_3']	釋如實覺云隨順如實覺者，因於順忍得無生故。	釋如實覺云隨順如實覺者，因於順忍得無生故。	036	The explanation of the realization of suchness says in accordance with the realization of suchness, because one attains non-arising through the acceptance of accordance.

['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a25_2']	二者同相，色心雖殊，同皆生住異滅所遷，舉初攝後故但名生。	二者同相，色心雖殊，同皆生住異滅所遷，舉初攝後故但名生。	036	Second, the common characteristic, although form and mind are distinct, they are all subject to arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing. Mentioning the first includes the latter, thus only called arising.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a26_10']	今四地菩薩了自及同皆緣生無性，成無分別慧，故云無行。	今四地菩薩了自及同皆緣生無性，成無分別慧，故云無行。	036	Now, the bodhisattva of the fourth ground understands that both the specific and common characteristics are dependently arisen and without nature, accomplishing non-discriminating wisdom, thus called without practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a27_13']	無生下一行字是慧行相，以無行無生為慧行相。	無生下一行字是慧行相，以無行無生為慧行相。	036	Without arising and the following character practice is the aspect of wisdom, taking without practice and without arising as the aspect of wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a28_9']	若如是行，則得八地覺法自性也。	若如是行，則得八地覺法自性也。	036	If practiced in this way, one will attain the self-nature of dharmas on the eighth ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782a29_11']	四此慧不離禪等者，謂此無生慧非定不發。	四此慧不離禪等者，謂此無生慧非定不發。	036	Fourth, this wisdom is not apart from dhyāna, etc., meaning that this wisdom of non-arising is not produced without concentration.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b02_4']	言禪善巧者，得三地滿勝進分禪故，出入自在亦不染禪，故名善巧。	言禪善巧者，得三地滿勝進分禪故，出入自在亦不染禪，故名善巧。	036	As for skillful means in dhyāna, it is because one attains the dhyāna of the stage of superior progress upon completion of the third ground, entering and exiting freely, and also not being attached to dhyāna, thus called skillful means.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b02_17']	決定者，於他四地決能發也。	決定者，於他四地決能發也。	036	Determination means being able to definitely give rise to the fourth ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b04_12']	觀察智者，論云自智慧觀故，謂即三地禪中之智，非前所發四地無生之慧。	觀察智者，論云自智慧觀故，謂即三地禪中之智，非前所發四地無生之慧。	036	As for the observing cognition, the treatise says it is due to one's own wisdom observing, referring to the cognition within the meditation of the three grounds, not the wisdom of non-arising of the four grounds that was previously aroused.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b05_13']	彼四地之慧，此中名光明，依此光明故名明地。	彼四地之慧，此中名光明，依此光明故名明地。	036	That wisdom of the four grounds is called light here, and because it relies on this light, it is called the ground of brightness.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b06_11']	故四地證慧，由三地禪中修慧而發。	故四地證慧，由三地禪中修慧而發。	036	Therefore, the wisdom realized in the four grounds is aroused by the wisdom cultivated within the meditation of the three grounds.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b07_18']	五此禪不離善巧多聞者，此中修慧，由後聞慧方得起故。	五此禪不離善巧多聞者，此中修慧，由後聞慧方得起故。	036	Fifth, this meditation is not apart from skillful and extensive learning, because this cultivated wisdom can only arise based on the subsequent wisdom of learning.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b08_9']	三節皆慧，而慧不同。	三節皆慧，而慧不同。	036	The three sections are all wisdom, but the wisdom is not the same.

['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b11_10']	然佛智之因乃通十地，而偏舉三者，此地聞修近所行故，四地是慧增之首故，八地無功用之初故。	然佛智之因乃通十地，而偏舉三者，此地聞修近所行故，四地是慧增之首故，八地無功用之初故。	036	However, the causes of the Buddha's wisdom are common to the ten grounds, but the three are specifically mentioned because this ground is close to what is practiced through learning and cultivation, the four grounds are the beginning of the increase in wisdom, and the eight grounds are the beginning of effortless practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_036:0782b11_17']	第四依思修行。	第四依思修行。	036	Fourth, relying on thought to cultivate practice.
