['ZH_T35_1735_042:0820c24_18']	三「離一切」下境界深，分齊殊絕故，由所取相離、能取相不現前故。	三「離一切」下境界深，分齊殊絕故，由所取相離、能取相不現前故。	The third, free from all... is the profundity of the realm, because the distinctions are extremely profound. It is due to the absence of the characteristics of the grasper and the grasped.

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a05_2']	上七別中，相從束為三分，能離前地四種惱患，謂初三明此地境分殊絕，離第四微細想行過，謂求如來智猶未息等；	上七別中，相從束為三分，能離前地四種惱患，謂初三明此地境分殊絕，離第四微細想行過，謂求如來智猶未息等；	Among the above seven distinctions, they are grouped into three parts according to their similarities. They are able to eliminate the four kinds of afflictions of the previous ground. The first three clarify the superior characteristics of the objects of this ground, eliminating the fourth affliction of subtle conceptual and volitional activity, namely, seeking the wisdom of the Tathāgatas but still not resting, etc.;

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a10_20']	《瑜伽》名四災患，義次亦同。	《瑜伽》名四災患，義次亦同。	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra calls them the four calamities, and the sequence of meanings is also the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a12_17']	第二喻中，文有三喻，從後次第喻前三段，為順治障從細至麁故，法中顯深故從麁至細。	第二喻中，文有三喻，從後次第喻前三段，為順治障從細至麁故，法中顯深故從麁至細。	In the second analogy, there are three analogies, which from the end in sequence illustrate the previous three sections.

It is the ninth of the nine successive concentrations, thus it says up to.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a16_16']	動心息者，謂所依六七心王已滅，能依心所憶想自亡。	動心息者，謂所依六七心王已滅，能依心所憶想自亡。	The cessation of moving mind means that the six and seven mental consciousnesses that are the basis have already ceased, and the mental activities that are based on them, such as memory and thought, are naturally gone.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a17_9']	合中住不動地，合入滅定。	合中住不動地，合入滅定。	In the correspondence, abiding in the stage of immobility corresponds to entering the concentration of cessation.

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a18_13']	即捨一切功用行者，過所治故。	即捨一切功用行者，過所治故。	Immediately abandoning all deliberate practices is because one has surpassed what is to be eliminated.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a19_9']	得無功用法者，明得彼治法故。	得無功用法者，明得彼治法故。	Attaining the Dharma of effortless practice clarifies that one has attained the Dharma that eliminates it.

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a22_1']	住於報行者，文含二意：	住於報行者，文含二意：	Abiding in the practice of retribution has two meanings:

This is based on the path of realization, the same as the above entering the nature of all dharmas like space, which avoids the fault of diligent effort in the second pure stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a26_18']	不同前地修無功用，故云報行。	不同前地修無功用，故云報行。	It is not the same as cultivating effortless practice in the previous stage, so it is called practice of retribution.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a27_14']	報行者，前地所修，報熟現前故。	報行者，前地所修，報熟現前故。	The practice of retribution is what was cultivated in the previous stage, ripening and manifesting.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a28_5']	住真如者，以本識有二分：	住真如者，以本識有二分：	Abiding in true suchness is because the fundamental consciousness has two aspects:
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a28_15']	一妄染分，凡夫所住；	一妄染分，凡夫所住；	First, the aspect of deluded defilement, which is where ordinary beings abide;

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821a29_16']	由住真如故，捨黎耶之名。	由住真如故，捨黎耶之名。	Because of abiding in suchness, the name ālaya is abandoned.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b01_12']	又佛地單住真如，不云黎耶真如；	又佛地單住真如，不云黎耶真如；	Moreover, the Buddha ground only abides in suchness, not called ālaya-suchness;
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b03_5']	今為有變易報在，是故雙舉，則黎耶言約異熟識，如來但名無垢識故。	今為有變易報在，是故雙舉，則黎耶言約異熟識，如來但名無垢識故。	Now, since there is still a transformed and transmuted retribution, therefore both are mentioned. The word ālaya refers to the uncontaminated consciousness, while the Tathāgata is only called the stainless consciousness.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b03_18']	第二夢寤喻，喻前正行廣大。	第二夢寤喻，喻前正行廣大。	The second analogy of dreaming and waking illustrates the vastness of the previous correct practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b05_3']	論云「示此行護彼過想者，離彼化生勤方便過故。	論云「示此行護彼過想者，離彼化生勤方便過故。	The treatise says, Indicating this practice and protecting against the thought of that transgression means being free from the transgression of diligently applying oneself to that transformation and birth.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b06_1']	」有正智想者，非無此地無功智故。	」有正智想者，非無此地無功智故。	The thought of correct knowledge means that this ground is not without the effortless wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b06_16']	如從夢寤，雖無夢想，非無寤想。	如從夢寤，雖無夢想，非無寤想。	Just as when one awakens from a dream, although there are no dream thoughts, it is not that there is no thought of awakening.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b07_10']	但此行寂滅，故云所作皆息。	但此行寂滅，故云所作皆息。	However, this practice is quiescent and extinct, so it is said that all activities cease.

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b12_6']	如彼寤時，此彼岸無依，外緣境界受用念想不行，故云相行不現，即離化生聖道等想。	如彼寤時，此彼岸無依，外緣境界受用念想不行，故云相行不現，即離化生聖道等想。	Like when awake, this shore and the other shore are without support, and the recollection and thought of the enjoyment of external objects do not operate, thus it is said the characteristics and practices do not manifest, which is to say, being free from the thoughts of the holy path of transformation and rebirth, etc.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b12_16']	如彼寤時，人船俱無。	如彼寤時，人船俱無。	Like when awake, neither the person nor the boat exist.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b13_19']	合中見人墮河喻中，身自墮者，眾生病即菩薩病故。	合中見人墮河喻中，身自墮者，眾生病即菩薩病故。	In the combined version, seeing a person fall into the river is like oneself falling, because the bodhisattva's illness is the same as the illness of sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821b14_12']	第三生梵天喻，喻境分殊絕。	第三生梵天喻，喻境分殊絕。	The third, the simile of being born in the Brahma heaven, illustrates the exceptional distinction of the realm.

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0821c04_2']	又法流者，即是行海。	又法流者，即是行海。	Moreover, the stream of Dharma is precisely the ocean of practice.

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0823b29_3']	即染分依他、淨分依他同依一實故。	即染分依他、淨分依他同依一實故。	This is because the defiled part of the dependent on others and the pure part of the dependent on others are the same in relying on the one reality.
['ZH_T35_1735_042:0823c01_2']	染中三者，初是眾生世間、次國土世間。	染中三者，初是眾生世間、次國土世間。	As for the three in the defiled, the first is the world of sentient beings, and the next is the world of the environment.

['ZH_T35_1735_042:0824b11_2']	又道前名世，見道已去名出世。	又道前名世，見道已去名出世。	Also, that before the path is called worldly, and that from the path of seeing onwards is called supramundane.
