The fundamental principle is profoundly tranquil, the spirit is concentrated and unified, shining alone in the dark source, and the perfect enlightenment is equally bright. It contains the utmost brilliance and disappears in discrimination, and the profound and vast current of mystery is hidden in the number of conditions. This can be said to be the fundamental state of sentient beings, the perfect purport of nirvāṇa, the true nature of causes and conditions, and the treasury of explanations of the Dharma realm.
