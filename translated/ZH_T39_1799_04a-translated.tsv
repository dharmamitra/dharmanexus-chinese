['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c12_7']	」前五句引所聞，即同《圓覺》剛藏云：	」前五句引所聞，即同《圓覺》剛藏云：	The first five sentences cite what was heard, which is the same as Vajra Treasury's statement in the Perfect Enlightenment Sutra:

['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c15_20']	」今經無此難者，意已含故。	」今經無此難者，意已含故。	The present sutra does not have this question, as the meaning is already implied.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c17_2']	復有牒而縱之責無窮過，即同下文別答違妨也。	復有牒而縱之責無窮過，即同下文別答違妨也。	There is also a passage that raises the question and points out the endless faults, which is the same as the following text's specific answer to the contradiction.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c18_2']	然剛藏所問，反覆成難，文聚一處，鉤鎖相連。	然剛藏所問，反覆成難，文聚一處，鉤鎖相連。	However, Vajra Treasury's questions form a difficulty by going back and forth, with the text gathered in one place, linked together like a chain.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c18_11']	如來答釋亦總示云：	如來答釋亦總示云：	The Tathagata's answer also generally indicates:
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c20_17']	「世界始終念念相續，一切對待皆由分別生死垢心輪迴妄見，未離妄見而辨覺性，遂令覺性成諸輪轉。	「世界始終念念相續，一切對待皆由分別生死垢心輪迴妄見，未離妄見而辨覺性，遂令覺性成諸輪轉。	The beginning and end of the world, thought after thought, all the opposites are due to the defiled mind of birth and death revolving in false views. Without leaving false views to discern the nature of enlightenment, it causes the nature of enlightenment to become all kinds of revolving.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c21_3']	」乃至結云：	」乃至結云：	And concludes by saying:
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c21_13']	「如是分別非為正問。	「如是分別非為正問。	Such discrimination is not a correct question.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c22_18']	」今經問既前後，答亦隨問，二經答意廣略雖別，大旨攸同。	」今經問既前後，答亦隨問，二經答意廣略雖別，大旨攸同。	Now, since the questions in this sutra are before and after, the answers also follow the questions. Although the meaning of the answers in the two sutras is different in breadth and brevity, the main purport is the same.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c23_3']	如彼經云：	如彼經云：	As that sutra says:
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c25_3']	「種種取捨皆是輪迴，未出輪迴而辨圓覺，彼圓覺性即同流轉，若免輪迴無有是處」等。	「種種取捨皆是輪迴，未出輪迴而辨圓覺，彼圓覺性即同流轉，若免輪迴無有是處」等。	All kinds of grasping and abandoning are all revolving. Without leaving the cycle of rebirth to discern perfect enlightenment, that nature of perfect enlightenment would be the same as revolving. If one avoids the cycle of rebirth, it is impossible.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c27_12']	此即責剛藏不了圓覺自性絕諸對待，生死涅槃猶如昨夢，遂引無明生死有為，反復成疑，以難眾生本來成佛。	此即責剛藏不了圓覺自性絕諸對待，生死涅槃猶如昨夢，遂引無明生死有為，反復成疑，以難眾生本來成佛。	This is to blame Vajra Treasury for not understanding that the self-nature of perfect enlightenment is beyond all opposites. Birth and death and nirvana are like dreams from the past. He then cites ignorance, birth and death, and conditioned arising, and repeatedly forms doubts, using them to question how sentient beings can originally be enlightened.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0873c29_15']	故佛斥此正是生死垢心，分別妄見，遂令圓覺成輪轉也，由是舉喻，雲駛月運、舟行岸移等。	故佛斥此正是生死垢心，分別妄見，遂令圓覺成輪轉也，由是舉喻，雲駛月運、舟行岸移等。	Therefore, the Buddha rebukes this as precisely the defiled mind of birth and death, discriminating and deluded views, which causes perfect enlightenment to become samsara. Based on this, he uses the analogy of clouds moving and the moon shifting, a boat moving and the shore shifting, and so forth.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0874a02_5']	今經即以常說本性覺體妙明明妙，反而責之，以辨滿慈解惑之心。	今經即以常說本性覺體妙明明妙，反而責之，以辨滿慈解惑之心。	Now, this sutra uses the constantly taught essence of intrinsic enlightenment, wondrous brightness and brightness, and wondrous, to turn back and reproach him, to discern Manjushri's mind of understanding and delusion.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0874a03_14']	解則已知覺體本妙，無明本空，山河大地如空華相，夫何致疑惑？	解則已知覺體本妙，無明本空，山河大地如空華相，夫何致疑惑？	If one understands, then one already knows that the essence of enlightenment is originally wondrous, and ignorance is originally empty, and the mountains, rivers, earth, and so forth are like the appearance of empty flowers. What doubt and confusion could one have?
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0874a06_7']	則能所妄分，強覺俄起，三細為本，四輪成界，遂有世界、眾生、業果、相續，斯皆未出輪迴而辨圓覺，彼圓覺性即同流轉。	則能所妄分，強覺俄起，三細為本，四輪成界，遂有世界、眾生、業果、相續，斯皆未出輪迴而辨圓覺，彼圓覺性即同流轉。	Then the delusion of subject and object is falsely divided, and sudden enlightenment arises. The three subtle [natures] are the basis, and the four wheels form the realm. There are then the continuation of the world, sentient beings, karma, and results. All of this is not yet out of samsara, yet distinguishes perfect enlightenment. That perfect enlightenment nature is the same as that which flows and turns.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0874a06_19']	故二經之意，問答竝同也。	故二經之意，問答竝同也。	Therefore, the meaning of the two sutras, the questions and answers, are the same.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0874a09_14']	然此是法空門下疑難大節，最障修證，滿慈迹雖小聖，今經圓通述悟無非大途，故所陳難剛藏無異，學者至此請細觀之。	然此是法空門下疑難大節，最障修證，滿慈迹雖小聖，今經圓通述悟無非大途，故所陳難剛藏無異，學者至此請細觀之。	However, this is a major point of doubt and difficulty in the Dharma-emptiness approach, which most obstructs cultivation and realization. Although Manjushri's traces are those of a small sage, in this sutra he describes his realization of the perfect truth, which is no different from that of the great path. Therefore, the difficulties he presents are no different from those of Vajra Treasury. Learners, when you reach this point, please observe carefully.
['ZH_T39_1799_04a:0874a10_3']	二、大性俱遍疑。	二、大性俱遍疑。	Second, the doubt about the all-pervasiveness of the great nature.

How is this different from not being able to wield a knife in the great void when dissecting an ox, not being able to transcend views when regarding the whole ox, but only understanding the skin and flesh and becoming attached to the bones? How can this be called the wondrous understanding of the principle of the ox?
