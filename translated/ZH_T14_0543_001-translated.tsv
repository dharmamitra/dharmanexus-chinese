They had accomplished all that needed to be done, removed their heavy burdens, attained their own benefits, and were liberated in wisdom and mind. They had mastery over all dharmas and were well able to cultivate the practices that reach the other shore.

His wealth and grain were innumerable, and he had all the enjoyments and precious playthings to his satisfaction.

The gardens, ponds, and strange flowers and fruits were all gathered within. The various adornments were incomparable to anything else. The maidservants and musicians were all of the highest quality, only surpassed by the king. The elder enjoyed himself to the utmost, day and night, without interruption for the six periods.

['ZH_T14_0543_001:0830a02_4']	爾時，巨力長者忽於一時，善根成熟心生覺悟，即自念言：	爾時，巨力長者忽於一時，善根成熟心生覺悟，即自念言：	001	At that time, the elder Jñānabala suddenly, at one time, when his wholesome roots had matured and his mind had awakened, he thought to himself:
['ZH_T14_0543_001:0830a04_15']	「浮世匪堅如夢所見，一切色相終歸磨滅，而此身者，體性本空亦復敗壞，五欲樂因增生苦果，群盲迷倒無解脫時。	「浮世匪堅如夢所見，一切色相終歸磨滅，而此身者，體性本空亦復敗壞，五欲樂因增生苦果，群盲迷倒無解脫時。	001	The floating world is not solid, like what is seen in a dream. All forms and appearances will eventually return to destruction. As for this body, its nature is originally empty and will also decay and perish. The causes of the five desires and pleasures increase the fruits of suffering. The multitude is confused and deluded, without a time for liberation.

All dharmas arise from the aggregation of conditions and cease when conditions disperse. Their essence is not real and will eventually decay and perish. Sentient beings give rise to deluded thoughts and create various discriminations, clinging to the notion of a self, a body, and their own retinue. They do not know that impermanence arises and ceases in an instant. Wealth, property, and houses will eventually belong to others. Out of foolishness and self-importance, they create the causes for the five destinies. Once karmic bonds are formed, they will receive various different retributions. It is easy to go to the evil paths but difficult to be reborn in the good destinies.

['ZH_T14_0543_001:0830a20_8']	若諸眾生，修諸功德生如來國心常堅固，是亦為難。	若諸眾生，修諸功德生如來國心常堅固，是亦為難。	001	If sentient beings cultivate various merits and are born in the land of the Tathāgata with a mind that is always firm, this is also difficult.
['ZH_T14_0543_001:0830a22_10']	「又諸眾生，能以方便善巧語言，種種勸誘諸善知識，營修福業往詣佛所親近供養，是則為難。	「又諸眾生，能以方便善巧語言，種種勸誘諸善知識，營修福業往詣佛所親近供養，是則為難。	001	Moreover, if sentient beings are able to skillfully use expedient means and skillful language to exhort and induce various good and virtuous friends, to engage in meritorious deeds, to go to the Buddha's place, and to draw near and make offerings, this is difficult.

Among the many people, they are able to create various adornments and Buddha-works, which is difficult.
['ZH_T14_0543_001:0830a26_17']	若有眾生，於聲聞乘精進禁戒欲求解脫、於辟支佛乘欲求解脫、於無上乘欲求解脫，真實為難。	若有眾生，於聲聞乘精進禁戒欲求解脫、於辟支佛乘欲求解脫、於無上乘欲求解脫，真實為難。	001	If there are sentient beings who diligently practice the precepts of the Śrāvaka Vehicle in order to seek liberation, who wish to seek liberation in the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, and who wish to seek liberation in the unsurpassed vehicle, it is truly difficult.
['ZH_T14_0543_001:0830a27_18']	」爾時巨力長者，說是三乘及諸事已，謂眾人言：	」爾時巨力長者，說是三乘及諸事已，謂眾人言：	001	At that time, the Elder Mahābaladhara, having spoken of these three vehicles and various matters, said to the assembly:

They held wonderful incense, flowers, various precious treasures, and together with the elder Mahāsthāmaprāpta, they went to where the Buddha was.
