['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0078c29_6']	次明念念不住。	次明念念不住。	05b	Next, it clarifies that [dharmas] do not abide for a moment.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0078c29_15']	次明即時生住異滅。	次明即時生住異滅。	05b	Next, it clarifies the arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing that occur at the same time.

['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a01_17']	此是佛說四相一時。	此是佛說四相一時。	05b	This is the Buddha's teaching on the four characteristics occurring simultaneously.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a02_7']	云何羅什言非佛說。	云何羅什言非佛說。	05b	How can it be that Kumārajīva says it is not the Buddha's teaching?
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a02_18']	答佛經明即時生住滅者。	答佛經明即時生住滅者。	05b	The answer is that the Buddha's sūtras that clarify arising, abiding, and ceasing at the same time
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a03_9']	亦不立四相一時並起。	亦不立四相一時並起。	05b	Do not establish the four characteristics arising simultaneously.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a04_1']	但為破眾生保常心耳。	但為破眾生保常心耳。	05b	It is merely to break through sentient beings' mind of clinging to permanence.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a04_10']	眾生若聞一念暫住。	眾生若聞一念暫住。	05b	If sentient beings hear that [dharmas] temporarily abide for a moment,

['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a05_3']	即計常心不盡。	即計常心不盡。	05b	The mind of clinging to permanence is not exhausted.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a05_15']	今明無一念住即計常心盡。	今明無一念住即計常心盡。	05b	Now, it is clarified that there is no abiding for a moment, and the mind of clinging to permanence is exhausted.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a06_5']	是故明即時生滅耳。	是故明即時生滅耳。	05b	Therefore, it clarifies arising and ceasing at the same time.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a06_18']	佛意既明無有常寧有無常耶。	佛意既明無有常寧有無常耶。	05b	Since the Buddha's intention clarifies that there is no permanence, how can there be impermanence?

['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a08_9']	又既明無一念住即是說無生義。	又既明無一念住即是說無生義。	05b	Moreover, since it is clarified that there is no abiding for a moment, it is the teaching of the meaning of non-arising.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a09_1']	夫論有一念住即有物。	夫論有一念住即有物。	05b	If one discusses the existence of abiding for a moment, then there is existence.

['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a10_8']	故云不生不滅是無常義。	故云不生不滅是無常義。	05b	Therefore, it is said that non-arising and non-ceasing is the meaning of impermanence.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a11_2']	即佛一言之中常無常並破。	即佛一言之中常無常並破。	05b	In the Buddha's single statement, both permanence and impermanence are refuted.

['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a12_1']	不達者便謂四相一時。	不達者便謂四相一時。	05b	Those who do not understand take the four characteristics to be simultaneous.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a12_8']	是故為論主破。	是故為論主破。	05b	Therefore, the author refutes this.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a13_3']	又論主破即是申一念不住之言。	又論主破即是申一念不住之言。	05b	Moreover, the author's refutation is precisely to explain the words a single thought does not abide.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a13_12']	令諸部解佛經意也。	令諸部解佛經意也。	05b	It causes the various schools to understand the Buddha's sutra meaning.

['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a14_15']	破聚正破薩婆多義。	破聚正破薩婆多義。	05b	The refutation of aggregation precisely refutes the Sarvāstivāda doctrine.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a15_8']	以有為必三相扶共起故也。	以有為必三相扶共起故也。	05b	Because the conditioned must be supported by the three characteristics arising together.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a16_5']	破散破譬喻部三剎那立三相義也。	破散破譬喻部三剎那立三相義也。	05b	The refutation of dispersion refutes the Sautrāntika doctrine of establishing the three characteristics in three moments.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a16_14']	又此一偈並破毘曇。	又此一偈並破毘曇。	05b	Moreover, this single verse refutes the Abhidharma altogether.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a17_1']	毘曇師二說。	毘曇師二說。	05b	The Abhidharma masters have two explanations.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a17_10']	一云體同時用前後。	一云體同時用前後。	05b	One says that the substance is simultaneous and the function is sequential.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a17_16']	用前後是散。	用前後是散。	05b	The sequential function is dispersion.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a18_2']	體同時是聚。	體同時是聚。	05b	The simultaneous substance is aggregation.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a18_9']	二云體用同時。	二云體用同時。	05b	The second says that the substance and function are simultaneous.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a18_19']	但當生用時生用即強。	但當生用時生用即強。	05b	But when the function of arising occurs, the function of arising is strong.

['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a19_13']	故此偈具破之也。	故此偈具破之也。	05b	Therefore, this verse refutes them all.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a20_4']	云何於一處釋上散義。	云何於一處釋上散義。	05b	How does it explain the above meaning of scattering in one place?
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a20_13']	一處者一所相法處。	一處者一所相法處。	05b	One place refers to the place of the dharma that is characterized.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a21_3']	不得三相前後生也。	不得三相前後生也。	05b	The three characteristics cannot arise in sequence.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a21_15']	若所相法處三相前後生者。	若所相法處三相前後生者。	05b	If the three characteristics of the dharma that is characterized arise in sequence,
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a22_4']	即有不備三相過。	即有不備三相過。	05b	then there would be the fault of not having the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a22_9']	如一念法。	如一念法。	05b	For example, in a single moment of dharma,
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a22_18']	若有生時未有滅用。	若有生時未有滅用。	05b	if there is arising but not yet the function of cessation,
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a23_9']	生用若廢即一念法便廢。	生用若廢即一念法便廢。	05b	if the function of arising is abandoned, then the single moment of dharma is abandoned.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a24_2']	當知此一念法但有於生。	當知此一念法但有於生。	05b	One should know that this single moment of dharma only has arising,
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a24_9']	遂不經於住滅。	遂不經於住滅。	05b	and does not go through abiding and cessation.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a24_19']	故此一念法不備三相。	故此一念法不備三相。	05b	Therefore, this single moment of dharma does not have the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a25_8']	然有為法必備三相。	然有為法必備三相。	05b	However, conditioned dharmas must have the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a25_17']	而今不備故非有為。	而今不備故非有為。	05b	But now they are not complete, so they are not conditioned.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a26_8']	又前念法體與生俱廢。	又前念法體與生俱廢。	05b	Moreover, the substance of the previous moment of dharma is abandoned together with arising,
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a26_17']	後念滅起便無所滅。	後念滅起便無所滅。	05b	and the subsequent moment of cessation arises without anything to cease.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a27_13']	既無所滅之法云何有能滅之相耶。	既無所滅之法云何有能滅之相耶。	05b	Since there is no dharma to cease, how can there be the characteristic of cessation?
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a28_9']	又正意是破其三相不備三相義。	又正意是破其三相不備三相義。	05b	Moreover, the correct intention is to refute the three characteristics not being complete, the meaning of the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a28_17']	當一剎那唯有生。	當一剎那唯有生。	05b	In one moment, there is only arising.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a29_7']	即此生相不備三相。	即此生相不備三相。	05b	This arising characteristic is not complete with the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079a29_18']	然有為法無有不備三相。	然有為法無有不備三相。	05b	However, conditioned dharmas do not exist without being complete with the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079b01_11']	汝生是有為云何不備三耶。	汝生是有為云何不備三耶。	05b	Since your arising is a conditioned dharma, how can it not be complete with the three?
['ZH_T42_1824_05b:0079b02_3']	若三相一時此即相違。	若三相一時此即相違。	05b	If the three characteristics arise simultaneously, then they contradict each other.
