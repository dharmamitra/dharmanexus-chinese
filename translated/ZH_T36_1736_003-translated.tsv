['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017a23_7']	玄義全盛，賢首方周，故講得五雲凝空、六種震地。	玄義全盛，賢首方周，故講得五雲凝空、六種震地。	003	The profound meaning is fully flourishing, and the wise and foremost are all-encompassing. Therefore, the lectures can cause the five clouds to gather in the sky and the six kinds of earthquakes.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017a24_12']	而《刊定記》主師承在茲，雖入先生之門，不曉亡羊之路；	而《刊定記》主師承在茲，雖入先生之門，不曉亡羊之路；	003	However, the master of the Record of the Definitive Edition relies on this. Although he enters the gate of the teacher, he does not understand the path of losing the sheep;

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017a27_7']	故大義屢乖、微言將隱，破五教而立四教，雜以邪宗，使權實不分，漸頓安辨？	故大義屢乖、微言將隱，破五教而立四教，雜以邪宗，使權實不分，漸頓安辨？	003	Therefore, the great meaning often deviates, and the subtle words are about to disappear. He breaks the five teachings and establishes the four teachings, mixing them with heterodox sects, causing the provisional and the real to be indistinguishable, and how can the gradual and sudden be discerned?
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b01_4']	析十玄之妙旨分成兩重，徒益繁多、別無異轍，使德相而無相即相入即用之體，不成德相、不通染門，交徹之旨寧就？	析十玄之妙旨分成兩重，徒益繁多、別無異轍，使德相而無相即相入即用之體，不成德相、不通染門，交徹之旨寧就？	003	He analyzes the wonderful meaning of the ten mysteries and divides them into two layers, in vain adding more and having no different tracks, causing the characteristics of virtue to be without characteristics, and the interpenetration to be the substance of use, not forming the characteristics of virtue, and not passing through the defiled gate, how can the meaning of mutual penetration be accomplished?
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b02_8']	出玄門之所以，但就如明，却令相用二門無由成異。	出玄門之所以，但就如明，却令相用二門無由成異。	003	The reason for leaving the profound gate is just to follow the light, but it makes the two gates of characteristics and function have no way to become different.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b04_8']	以緣起相由之玄旨，同理性融通之一門，遂令法界大緣起之法門一多交徹而微隱。	以緣起相由之玄旨，同理性融通之一門，遂令法界大緣起之法門一多交徹而微隱。	003	The profound meaning of the arising of characteristics by mutual dependence is the same as the one gate of the interfusion of principle and nature, thus making the Dharma gate of the great arising of the Dharma realm with the mutual penetration of one and many slightly hidden.

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b07_4']	今申上古之義，新疏翻多有同《刊定》之文，皆是古義今同用耳。	今申上古之義，新疏翻多有同《刊定》之文，皆是古義今同用耳。	003	Now I will explain the meaning of the ancients. The new commentary often has the same text as the Kaiding edition, which are all the ancient meanings used by the present.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b08_12']	第四剪截浮詞直論至理者，且文華尚猶翳理，繁言豈不亂心。	第四剪截浮詞直論至理者，且文華尚猶翳理，繁言豈不亂心。	003	Fourth, cutting out the floating words and directly discussing the ultimate principle. Even literary elegance still obscures the principle, how much more so the verbose words that do not disturb the mind.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b09_12']	科文過碎已雜塵飛，重疊經句但盈紙墨。	科文過碎已雜塵飛，重疊經句但盈紙墨。	003	The sections of the text are too fragmented, already mixed with flying dust, and the repeated sutra phrases only fill paper and ink.

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b12_4']	如烟欝火，雲翳長空，今並剪而削之，若長風卷霧。	如烟欝火，雲翳長空，今並剪而削之，若長風卷霧。	003	Like smoke obscuring fire, clouds covering the long sky, now all cut and removed, like a long wind rolling up the mist.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b14_3']	然經多十句，若過半已上難者，則具而釋之，難則曲盡而非繁，易則略陳而不闕；	然經多十句，若過半已上難者，則具而釋之，難則曲盡而非繁，易則略陳而不闕；	003	However, if the sutra has more than half of the ten phrases, and it is difficult, then it will be fully explained. If it is difficult, then it will be fully explained, and if it is easy, then it will be briefly presented without omission.

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b20_16']	第五善自他宗不妄破斥者，謂昔人所引經論及破他義，無問性相，多不窮於始末，輒引輒破。	第五善自他宗不妄破斥者，謂昔人所引經論及破他義，無問性相，多不窮於始末，輒引輒破。	003	Fifth, not falsely refuting one's own and others' schools means that in the past, people cited sutras, treatises, and refuted others' meanings, regardless of nature or characteristics, often not exhausting the beginning and end, and immediately cited and immediately refuted.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b22_8']	或多用法相，而復盡呼為權，引權釋實又不分通局，疑誤後學。	或多用法相，而復盡呼為權，引權釋實又不分通局，疑誤後學。	003	Or using many dharmas and characteristics, and again calling them all expedient, citing the expedient to explain the real without distinguishing the scope, confusing later students.

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b28_3', 'ZH_T36_1736_003:0017b29_12']	第六辨析今古新舊義殊者，謂《探玄》本記但釋晉經，大旨雖同，在言有異。🔽但引彼疏須觀所釋，如〈發心品〉晉經云「以是發心即得佛故。	第六辨析今古新舊義殊者，謂《探玄》本記但釋晉經，大旨雖同，在言有異。 但引彼疏須觀所釋，如〈發心品〉晉經云「以是發心即得佛故。	003	The sixth is distinguishing the differences between the new and old meanings of ancient and modern times. The original commentary on the Tanhui only explains the Jin edition, although the main points are the same, there are differences in the words.🔽But citing that commentary requires observing what is explained, such as in the Chapter on Generating the Mind, the Jin edition says because of this generating the mind one immediately attains Buddhahood.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c01_6']	」唐經云「以是發心當得佛故。	」唐經云「以是發心當得佛故。	003	The Tang edition says because of this generating the mind one will attain Buddhahood.

Below the third stage, many only used the old records.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c05_2']	二經小異，舛互相參，文亦非一。	二經小異，舛互相參，文亦非一。	003	The two sutras have slight differences, and they contradict each other. The texts are also not the same.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c07_12']	第七明示法相顯經包含者，然性之與相，若天之日月、易之乾坤，東夏西方分宗開教，學兼兩轍方曰通人。	第七明示法相顯經包含者，然性之與相，若天之日月、易之乾坤，東夏西方分宗開教，學兼兩轍方曰通人。	003	The seventh, clarifying the characteristics of the Dharma and showing the sutra's comprehensiveness, is that as for nature and characteristics, they are like the sun and moon in the sky, and the Qian and Kun hexagrams in the Yijing. The Eastern Xia and the Western Regions divide their teachings based on the schools, and those who study both paths are called all-encompassing people.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c08_4']	是以釋經，事須明示。	是以釋經，事須明示。	003	Therefore, in explaining the sutra, it is necessary to clearly show.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c09_8']	然此經法相，名義兼廣，或有名無義、或有義無名。	然此經法相，名義兼廣，或有名無義、或有義無名。	003	However, the characteristics of the Dharma in this sutra have both extensive names and meanings, some have names but no meanings, and some have meanings but no names.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c10_11']	昔人苟見一名，廣引論釋，隨名解義，義乃無窮。	昔人苟見一名，廣引論釋，隨名解義，義乃無窮。	003	In the past, people, if they saw a name, widely cited the treatises to explain it, and according to the name, understood the meaning, and the meaning was endless.

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c16_10']	古人若有義無名，則莫知所以，今則引諸經論以名管之，使經中法相昭彰於眾論。	古人若有義無名，則莫知所以，今則引諸經論以名管之，使經中法相昭彰於眾論。	003	If the ancients had meaning but no names, then one would not know the reason. Now, by citing various sūtras and śāstras, they are categorized by names, causing the characteristics of the Dharma in the sūtras to be clearly seen in the various treatises.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c18_3']	至如〈兜率品〉二十一種功德，則有義無名，〈離世間品〉初則有名無義。	至如〈兜率品〉二十一種功德，則有義無名，〈離世間品〉初則有名無義。	003	As for the twenty-one kinds of merits in the Chapter on Tuṣita Heaven, there is meaning but no names. In the beginning of the Chapter on Transcending the World, there are names but no meaning.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c19_11']	今於〈兜率品〉廣引經論而釋之，至〈離世間品〉略陳而已。	今於〈兜率品〉廣引經論而釋之，至〈離世間品〉略陳而已。	003	Now, in the Chapter on Tuṣita Heaven, various sūtras and śāstras are extensively cited to explain it. In the Chapter on Transcending the World, it is briefly presented.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c21_16']	又如〈離世間品〉具舍諸位，一一位內攝義無遺，或名異義同、或前後廣略，然於四十二位次第無差。	又如〈離世間品〉具舍諸位，一一位內攝義無遺，或名異義同、或前後廣略，然於四十二位次第無差。	003	Moreover, as in the Chapter on Transcending the World, all the stages are fully included, and within each stage, the meanings are all encompassed without exception, either with different names but the same meaning, or with different details in the earlier and later parts. However, the sequence of the forty-two stages is not different.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c23_17']	今並具引六會經文，對前釋之，昭然可見，使七卷之經句句有據，翻驗昔解臆說尤多。	今並具引六會經文，對前釋之，昭然可見，使七卷之經句句有據，翻驗昔解臆說尤多。	003	Now, I will fully quote the sutra text of the six assemblies and compare it with the previous explanations, which will be clearly seen. It will make the seven-scroll sutra have a basis for every sentence, and it will verify that the past explanations are mostly mere speculation.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c25_15']	然性相二宗，法相有同有異，如五眼十眼六通十通等，並各示之，使無餘惑。	然性相二宗，法相有同有異，如五眼十眼六通十通等，並各示之，使無餘惑。	003	However, the two schools of nature and characteristics have both similarities and differences in the characteristics of dharmas, such as the five eyes, ten eyes, six supernormal powers, and ten supernormal powers, and they are all shown separately to avoid any remaining doubts.

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c27_17']	釋智入三世，廣引四智，即法相宗之法相也。	釋智入三世，廣引四智，即法相宗之法相也。	003	Explaining the wisdom entering the three times and extensively citing the four wisdoms are the characteristics of dharmas in the school of characteristics.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0017c29_3']	以眾海解脫之門，釋眾海之名目，法性宗之法相也。	以眾海解脫之門，釋眾海之名目，法性宗之法相也。	003	Using the door of liberation of the ocean of multitudes to explain the names and categories of the ocean of multitudes is the characteristics of dharmas in the school of the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a01_5']	以九門之六度釋經十度，即法相宗之法相也。	以九門之六度釋經十度，即法相宗之法相也。	003	Using the six perfections of the nine approaches to explain the ten perfections of the sutra is the doctrinal characteristics of the Dharma characteristics school.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a04_8']	如十通十忍會六通五忍，十身十智融三身三智，十門涅槃以會通四種涅槃，十種佛智而一智融於四智，即性相二宗無違之法相也。	如十通十忍會六通五忍，十身十智融三身三智，十門涅槃以會通四種涅槃，十種佛智而一智融於四智，即性相二宗無違之法相也。	003	Such as reconciling the ten spiritual powers with the six spiritual powers and the ten forbearances with the five forbearances, harmonizing the ten bodies and ten wisdoms with the three bodies and three wisdoms, reconciling the ten aspects of nirvana with the four kinds of nirvana, and harmonizing the ten kinds of buddha-wisdom with the one wisdom and the four wisdoms, are the doctrinal characteristics that do not contradict the two schools of nature and characteristics.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a04_13']	觸類非一。	觸類非一。	003	There are many such examples.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a06_21']	又諸經疏所明法相，多是傍來，如《法華經》但云「如來知見、力、無所畏、禪定、解脫、三昧，深入無際。	又諸經疏所明法相，多是傍來，如《法華經》但云「如來知見、力、無所畏、禪定、解脫、三昧，深入無際。	003	Moreover, the doctrinal characteristics explained in various sutra commentaries are often incidental, such as the Lotus Sutra only saying, The Tathagata's knowledge and vision, powers, fearlessnesses, dhyanas, liberations, samadhis, deeply enter the boundless.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a11_5']	」斯乃通讚佛智深遠，逢力一字立十力章、無所畏字立四無畏章、禪立四禪、定立八定、解脫三昧並立章門，若此之流，千章萬章釋一卷經亦不得盡，若為成種智之境，應須更學多門。	」斯乃通讚佛智深遠，逢力一字立十力章、無所畏字立四無畏章、禪立四禪、定立八定、解脫三昧並立章門，若此之流，千章萬章釋一卷經亦不得盡，若為成種智之境，應須更學多門。	003	This is a general praise of the Buddha's wisdom as profound and far-reaching. Encountering the word power, it establishes the chapter on the ten powers; encountering the word fearlessness, it establishes the chapter on the four fearlessnesses; encountering meditation, it establishes the four meditations; encountering concentration, it establishes the eight concentrations; encountering liberation and samādhi, it establishes the chapters on liberation and samādhi. If it were like this, even if one explained a single fascicle of sūtra with a thousand or ten thousand chapters, one would still not be able to exhaust it. If it is to be the realm of omniscience, one should study more extensively.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a13_5']	取《法華》玄宗，但示眾生等有知見，先所出內是子所知，非是十章五章能盡斯妙。	取《法華》玄宗，但示眾生等有知見，先所出內是子所知，非是十章五章能盡斯妙。	003	Taking the profound principles of the Lotus Sūtra, it simply shows that all sentient beings possess knowledge and insight. What has been previously revealed is what the children should know, but it cannot be exhausted by ten or five chapters.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a15_3']	若《華嚴經》有異於此，如十度十力，一經數十處明故，須總撮一章頓曉玄旨。	若《華嚴經》有異於此，如十度十力，一經數十處明故，須總撮一章頓曉玄旨。	003	If the Huayan Sūtra is different from this, it is like the ten perfections and ten powers, which are clarified in the sūtra dozens of times. Therefore, one should comprehensively grasp a single chapter and suddenly understand the profound meaning.
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a16_10']	如〈十地品〉內以法相為觀門，不了三聚，豈知離垢之名？	如〈十地品〉內以法相為觀門，不了三聚，豈知離垢之名？	003	In the Ten Grounds chapter, using the characteristics of dharmas as the contemplation gate, if one does not understand the three collections, how can one know the name of freedom from defilements?
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a17_4']	不曉八禪，寧知發光之行？	不曉八禪，寧知發光之行？	003	If one does not understand the eight dhyānas, how can one know the practice of giving rise to light?
['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a17_16']	四地道品，成無生之慧光。	四地道品，成無生之慧光。	003	The four grounds cultivate the wisdom of non-arising.

['ZH_T36_1736_003:0018a19_16']	六地般若要觀緣生，星羅十門月滿三觀，研窮性相般若現前。	六地般若要觀緣生，星羅十門月滿三觀，研窮性相般若現前。	003	The sixth ground's essential contemplation of dependent origination, with the ten gates like stars and the three contemplations like the full moon, thoroughly investigates the nature and characteristics, and the wisdom of prajñā appears.
