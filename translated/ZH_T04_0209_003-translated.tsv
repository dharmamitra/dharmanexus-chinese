The two foolish people completely covered the skin with fine silk, and the silk rotted and was destroyed. The price of the skin and silk was naturally vastly different, but because of their foolishness, they covered the skin with silk.
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0549c14_1']	世間之人亦復如是，其不殺者喻於白㲲，其駝皮者即喻財貨，天雨濕爛喻於放逸敗壞善行。	世間之人亦復如是，其不殺者喻於白㲲，其駝皮者即喻財貨，天雨濕爛喻於放逸敗壞善行。	003	People in the world are also like this. The one who does not kill is likened to the white silk, the camel skin is likened to the goods, and the rain that wets and rots is likened to the destruction of good conduct due to indulgence.
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0549c17_10']	不殺戒者即佛法身最上妙因，然不能修，但以財貨造諸塔廟供養眾僧，捨根取末不求其本，漂浪五道莫能自出，是故行者應當精心持不殺戒。	不殺戒者即佛法身最上妙因，然不能修，但以財貨造諸塔廟供養眾僧，捨根取末不求其本，漂浪五道莫能自出，是故行者應當精心持不殺戒。	003	As for the precept against killing, it is the supreme and wondrous cause for the Buddha's Dharma body. However, if one is unable to cultivate it but only uses wealth to build various stupas and temples to make offerings to the saṃgha, abandoning the root and grasping at the branches, not seeking its basis, one will drift and wander in the five destinies unable to extricate oneself. Therefore, practitioners should earnestly uphold the precept against killing.

The effort is great, but the expectation is very light.

Only then should one seek fame, arrogance, and conceit, which will increase problems and afflictions.

The Parable of Half a Cake (44) The Parable of Half a Cake: It is like a person who, because of hunger, eats seven fried cakes. After eating six and a half, he becomes full. The person becomes angry and frustrated, and beats himself, saying:
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0549c29_16']	「我今飽足由此半餅，然前六餅唐自捐棄，設知半餅能充足者，應先食之。	「我今飽足由此半餅，然前六餅唐自捐棄，設知半餅能充足者，應先食之。	003	I am now full because of this half a cake, but the previous six cakes were wasted. If I had known that half a cake could satisfy me, I should have eaten it first.
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0550a02_7']	」世間之人亦復如是，從本以來常無有樂，然其癡倒橫生樂想。	」世間之人亦復如是，從本以來常無有樂，然其癡倒橫生樂想。	003	People in the world are also like this. From the beginning, there has always been no happiness, yet they foolishly give rise to the thought of happiness.
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0550a03_13']	如彼癡人於半番餅生於飽想，世人無知以富貴為樂。	如彼癡人於半番餅生於飽想，世人無知以富貴為樂。	003	Like that foolish person who gives rise to the thought of being full because of half a cake, worldly people are ignorant and take wealth and nobility to be happiness.
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0550a05_12']	夫富貴者，求時甚苦，既獲得已守護亦苦，後還失之憂念復苦，於三時中都無有樂。	夫富貴者，求時甚苦，既獲得已守護亦苦，後還失之憂念復苦，於三時中都無有樂。	003	As for wealth and nobility, when seeking them, it is very painful. Even after obtaining them, guarding them is also painful. Later, losing them again, worrying is also painful. In the three periods of time, there is no happiness at all.
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0550a06_17']	猶如衣食遮故名樂，於辛苦中橫生樂想，諸佛說言：	猶如衣食遮故名樂，於辛苦中橫生樂想，諸佛說言：	003	Just as clothing and food are called happiness because they prevent suffering, in the midst of hardship one gives rise to the thought of happiness. The Buddhas say:
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0550a07_18']	「三界無安，皆是大苦，凡夫倒惑，橫生樂想。	「三界無安，皆是大苦，凡夫倒惑，橫生樂想。	003	The three realms are not at peace, all are great suffering. Ordinary beings are deluded and give rise to the thought of happiness.

The slave wants to listen but cannot bear it. He then ties the rope to the door, puts it on the donkey, and rides it to the feast to listen to the music.

The Tathāgata always instructs to guard the sense gates and not to be attached to the six sense objects, to watch over the donkey of ignorance and the rope of craving.
['ZH_T04_0209_003:0550a22_1']	而諸比丘不奉佛教，貪求利養詐現清白靜處而坐，心意流馳貪著五欲，為色聲香味之所惑亂，無明覆心愛索纏縛，正念覺意道品財寶悉皆散失。	而諸比丘不奉佛教，貪求利養詐現清白靜處而坐，心意流馳貪著五欲，為色聲香味之所惑亂，無明覆心愛索纏縛，正念覺意道品財寶悉皆散失。	003	Yet the bhikṣus do not follow the Buddha's teachings. They greedily seek benefits and offerings, deceptively displaying purity and sitting in quiet places, but their minds run wild, attached to the five desires. They are confused and disturbed by form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. The mind is covered by ignorance and bound by the rope of craving. The wealth of right mindfulness, the factors of enlightenment, and the factors of the path are all scattered and lost.
