The correct cause with the principle of the six dharmas is therefore not separate, but only because of principle it is not identical. The conditions and understanding with the six are also like this.

The conditions and understanding are not identical, now adding not separate. Therefore, each must be complete to be called exhausting the principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0247c13_2']	此用《大經》摸象之喻，喻文具如《止觀》第三記引。	此用《大經》摸象之喻，喻文具如《止觀》第三記引。	This uses the analogy of touching an elephant in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, the analogy text is fully cited in the third record of the Śamathavipaśyanā.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0247c14_7']	言「六法」者，五陰、神我，是故此六亦名正因，同屬苦故；	言「六法」者，五陰、神我，是故此六亦名正因，同屬苦故；	As for six dharmas, they are the five skandhas and the spirit-self. Therefore, these six are also called the correct cause, because they belong to suffering together.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0247c18_18']	若通對者，具如今文，六法性德正因與六法修得緣了，不即不離，是故修六性六一體無殊。	若通對者，具如今文，六法性德正因與六法修得緣了，不即不離，是故修六性六一體無殊。	If generally corresponding, it is as the present text. The nature virtues of the six dharmas and the cultivation attainment of the six dharmas, conditions and understanding, are neither identical nor separate. Therefore, the six of cultivation and the six of nature are of one essence without distinction.

If this text is compared with the general and specific correspondences in the Śamathavipaśyanā, they correspond to the three virtues and four virtues of the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, each having its own meaning.

It should be said that the fourth is to generally conclude the above three with the oneness of person and principle. It may not be like the above, but the principle should be different from the text.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0247c27_18']	故今云四，又有二不同：	故今云四，又有二不同：	Therefore, it is now said to be four, and there are two differences:

Therefore, they first describe the non-dharmas, and then explain the correct ones.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248a08_7']	初師五譬者，一長者譬，即若國邑下文是，法說即指今我亦如是已下文是。	初師五譬者，一長者譬，即若國邑下文是，法說即指今我亦如是已下文是。	The first master's five parables: the first is the parable of the elder, which is the text below if in a city or town, the Dharma explanation refers to the text below I am also like this.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248a18_1']	第二思濟，於今家是救子不得者，但是別譬中用大擬宜譬耳。	第二思濟，於今家是救子不得者，但是別譬中用大擬宜譬耳。	The second is thinking of saving, in the present family it is those who cannot save the child, but it is only used in the great analogy of the separate analogy.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248a19_18']	故知但云思濟其理不盡，故用大救子中三，擬宜無機息化，不應獨云思濟故也。	故知但云思濟其理不盡，故用大救子中三，擬宜無機息化，不應獨云思濟故也。	Therefore, it is known that it is only said to think of saving, the principle is not exhausted, therefore, the three in the great saving of the child are used, the analogy is not suitable, the teaching is stopped, and it should not be said alone to think of saving.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248a21_16']	第三譬去，今家從我以去，於別譬中離為六意，彼但有三，譬本不足故亦不用。	第三譬去，今家從我以去，於別譬中離為六意，彼但有三，譬本不足故亦不用。	The third analogy and below, the present family starts from me and below, in the separate analogy, it is separated into six meanings.

The three Buddhas' text is even more brief according to the example. The text of Shakyamuni, the transforming master, is slightly more detailed, so he only takes Shakyamuni to be the four chapters. Master Yao's rambling is therefore not used.

The two masters did not establish a general parable, and there is no way to correspond it to the brief summary of skillful means. In the specific parables, the text is extensively summarized, and among the six meanings, it is still first divided into four, and further divided into more. Therefore, it is known that the two masters are not in accordance with the meaning of the Parable Chapter. The third and fourth are just the second, the cessation of the great and the bestowal of the small, in this treatise.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248c17_11']	今雖十八，不名十八句者，但在法譬宿世信解無此義故，欲令通有復合為五，或總別二，章段既少上下易同，故今文中三種分文，光宅定十無此盈縮，進不成十九、退不成五，總別廣略又不相當，況開大機以為兩段，法中有妨故不合開。	今雖十八，不名十八句者，但在法譬宿世信解無此義故，欲令通有復合為五，或總別二，章段既少上下易同，故今文中三種分文，光宅定十無此盈縮，進不成十九、退不成五，總別廣略又不相當，況開大機以為兩段，法中有妨故不合開。	Now, although there are eighteen, it is not called eighteen phrases, because only in the Dharma, parables, and past lives there is this meaning of faith and understanding. Wishing to make it通 have, it is again combined into five, or two, general and specific. Since the chapters are few and the upper and lower are easily the same, the text now has three kinds of division of the text. Guangzhai定十 does not have this expansion and contraction. If advanced, it does not become nineteen, if retreated, it does not become five. The general and specific, broad and concise are also not corresponding. Moreover, opening the great opportunity into two sections, there is an obstruction in the Dharma, so it is not appropriate to open it.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248c19_16']	「若以」至「六義之內」者，若立此六則攝十九入此六中，何以不但云為六義耶？	「若以」至「六義之內」者，若立此六則攝十九入此六中，何以不但云為六義耶？	If with up to within the six meanings means that if these six are established, then the nineteen are included within these six. Why not just say it is for the six meanings?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248c20_1']	何者？	何者？	What is that?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248c22_1']	依前總六却合為一，於別四中但離第二以為二段，則為五章，對前總一即成六義。	依前總六却合為一，於別四中但離第二以為二段，則為五章，對前總一即成六義。	Relying on the previous general six, they are combined into one. Within the specific four, only the second is separated into two sections, then it becomes five chapters. Facing the previous general one, it becomes six meanings.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248c23_2']	若全依今文但成五義，他且依彼而為問辭。	若全依今文但成五義，他且依彼而為問辭。	If we rely solely on the present text, we only achieve five meanings. Others rely on that to form the question.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248c24_15']	「又十譬」至「參差」等者，開為十譬，法譬二處尚自參差，況與信解等文合耶？	「又十譬」至「參差」等者，開為十譬，法譬二處尚自參差，況與信解等文合耶？	Also, the ten parables... to inconsistencies and so on. The ten parables are opened up, and the Dharma and parable places are still inconsistent, let alone being combined with the text of the Lotus Sutra and so on.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0248c27_14']	下結云「四失」者，一前後，二大小，三有無，四引文。	下結云「四失」者，一前後，二大小，三有無，四引文。	The conclusion below says four mistakes: first, before and after; second, large and small; third, existence and nonexistence; fourth, citing the text.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a03_12']	今初前後不同失者，若於今別細開中，第五離為五六，并第七文為父喜者，對於法說索車父喜前後迴互，言法說中索車在前者，先云舍利弗當知我見佛子等至求佛道者等，二行即索車在前，即光宅第六文是。	今初前後不同失者，若於今別細開中，第五離為五六，并第七文為父喜者，對於法說索車父喜前後迴互，言法說中索車在前者，先云舍利弗當知我見佛子等至求佛道者等，二行即索車在前，即光宅第六文是。	Now, the first error of the difference in sequence is as follows: If in the present detailed explanation, the fifth is divided into the sixth and seventh, and the seventh text is taken as the father's joy, then the sequence of the request for the vehicle and the father's joy in the parable is reversed. As for the statement that in the doctrinal explanation the request for the vehicle comes first, it is said that first Śāriputra should know that I see the Buddha's disciples, up to those who seek the Buddha way, the two lines are the request for the vehicle coming first, which is Guangzhai's sixth text.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a05_1']	次二行一句中最後一句方云今我喜無畏，即父喜在後也。	次二行一句中最後一句方云今我喜無畏，即父喜在後也。	Next, in the last line of the two lines and one line, it says Now I am joyful and fearless, which is the father's joy coming later.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a07_8']	譬說中父喜在前者，先云爾時長者見諸子等安隱得出等，索車在後者，次文方云時諸子等各白父言等。	譬說中父喜在前者，先云爾時長者見諸子等安隱得出等，索車在後者，次文方云時諸子等各白父言等。	As for the father's joy coming first in the parable, it is said that at that time the elder saw that the children were safely able to come out, and the request for the vehicle comes later, the next text says that then the children each said to their father, etc.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a09_10']	若光宅十譬中合於五六二段，同為一索車譬本，及免難譬本，不云歡喜譬本，則無此失。	若光宅十譬中合於五六二段，同為一索車譬本，及免難譬本，不云歡喜譬本，則無此失。	If Guangzhai combines the last ten similes into two sections, the same as the original simile of the carriage sought and the original simile of escaping from danger, and does not say it is the original simile of joy, then there is no such mistake.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a11_6']	言「雖欲會通」者，縱欲曲通，云由喜故索、由索故喜，亦未穩便，故云「迂迴」。	言「雖欲會通」者，縱欲曲通，云由喜故索、由索故喜，亦未穩便，故云「迂迴」。	As for although wanting to reconcile, even if one wants to reconcile by saying that because of joy one seeks, and because of seeking one is joyful, it is still not stable, so it is called circuitous.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a11_22']	「又大小」下，於大小中復為三失。	「又大小」下，於大小中復為三失。	Moreover, in the great and small below, there are three more mistakes in the great and small.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a14_6']	言「法說中大機動」者，即大小不對，今我喜無畏更進用下句云於諸菩薩中，故知此是見大機動故喜。	言「法說中大機動」者，即大小不對，今我喜無畏更進用下句云於諸菩薩中，故知此是見大機動故喜。	As for the great one is moved in the Dharma explanation, it is not corresponding to the great and small. Now I am joyful and fearless, and further apply the next sentence, saying among the bodhisattvas, therefore it is known that this is seeing the great one being moved and therefore being joyful.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a15_12']	若云見諸子等安隱得出，故知是見小機免火宅難故喜。	若云見諸子等安隱得出，故知是見小機免火宅難故喜。	If it is said that seeing the children safely coming out is therefore known to be seeing the small one escaping from the danger of the burning house and therefore being joyful.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a17_15']	次「因果不對」者，法說中意云由昔不信，故云舍利弗當知乃至今我喜無畏，故知是大因。	次「因果不對」者，法說中意云由昔不信，故云舍利弗當知乃至今我喜無畏，故知是大因。	Next, cause and effect do not correspond means that the meaning in the doctrinal explanation is that because of disbelief in the past, it says Śāriputra should know... up to now I am joyful and fearless, so it is known to be the great cause.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a18_14']	譬中云見諸子等得出火宅，故知是小果。	譬中云見諸子等得出火宅，故知是小果。	In the parable, it says seeing the children... come out of the burning house, so it is known to be the small fruition.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a21_1']	法說中大障將傾者，爾後即云菩薩聞是法疑網皆已除，去除不遠，譬說中云安隱得出，故云小果。	法說中大障將傾者，爾後即云菩薩聞是法疑網皆已除，去除不遠，譬說中云安隱得出，故云小果。	In the doctrinal explanation, the great obstruction is about to collapse, and after that it says the bodhisattvas hearing this teaching, all their webs of doubt are already removed, removing it is not far, in the parable it says peacefully coming out, so it is said to be the small fruition.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a22_5']	有此三失，過由光宅五六七文，故作譬本未為穩便。	有此三失，過由光宅五六七文，故作譬本未為穩便。	There are these three faults, the fault lies in Guangzhai's sixth, seventh, and eighth texts, so the parable basis is not yet stable.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a25_4']	言「又有無異」者，破其十中第六為下索車譬本，法說文中無索車語，至譬說中由根非利所以方有，故不得用為索車譬本。	言「又有無異」者，破其十中第六為下索車譬本，法說文中無索車語，至譬說中由根非利所以方有，故不得用為索車譬本。	As for there is also a difference between existence and non-existence, it refutes the sixth of the ten as the parable basis for the children's request for vehicles below. The doctrinal explanation text does not have the words request for vehicles, but in the parable explanation, because the faculties are not sharp, it is only then that there is [the request], so it cannot be used as the parable basis for the request for vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a26_12']	況法說中但云我見佛子等志求佛道者，非關二乘索小車也。	況法說中但云我見佛子等志求佛道者，非關二乘索小車也。	How much more so in the Dharma-explanation, which only says I see the Buddha's disciples who aspire to the Buddha Way, which has nothing to do with the two vehicles seeking the small vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a28_3']	四「若引」下為引文失，豈得濫用來至之言，便為小乘索車譬本？	四「若引」下為引文失，豈得濫用來至之言，便為小乘索車譬本？	Fourth, below if one quotes, it is a mistake to quote the text. How can one recklessly use the words come to and take them as the basis for the parable of the small vehicle seeking the vehicle?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249a29_8']	此從合為四別譬責，故別譬第三復合為一等賜文也。	此從合為四別譬責，故別譬第三復合為一等賜文也。	This is from the combined four different parables to be blamed, so the third parable is combined again as one to give equally.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b02_3']	縱開此為四，第一名為大乘機動，為後索車譬本，但不得云索小車耳。	縱開此為四，第一名為大乘機動，為後索車譬本，但不得云索小車耳。	Even if this is divided into four, the first is called the great vehicle's movement, which is the basis for the parable of seeking the vehicle later, but it cannot be said to be seeking the small vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b04_15']	故前約大小破中云，譬說敘小果，秖云敘小而情求於大，即名機動，故云殊不體文旨，故知其文自是大機將動。	故前約大小破中云，譬說敘小果，秖云敘小而情求於大，即名機動，故云殊不體文旨，故知其文自是大機將動。	Therefore, in the previous discussion of the great and small, it is said that the parable describes the small fruit, but it only describes the small, while emotionally seeking the great, is called the movement of the great vehicle. Therefore, it is said that one does not understand the meaning of the text. Therefore, it is known that the text itself is the great vehicle's movement about to occur.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b06_15']	然有無者下今文自辯同異有六，初有無中云「長行有真偽」者，簡偽敦信文也。	然有無者下今文自辯同異有六，初有無中云「長行有真偽」者，簡偽敦信文也。	However, below existence and non-existence, the present text itself distinguishes the similarities and differences in six ways. In the first, on existence and non-existence, it says the prose has true and false, which is the text that distinguishes the false and encourages faith.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b08_1']	言「偈中無」者，此且一往順舊，以偈末七行為法說流通。	言「偈中無」者，此且一往順舊，以偈末七行為法說流通。	As for the phrase it is not in the verse, this is just a provisional agreement with the old interpretation, taking the last seven lines of the verse as the Dharma explanation and distribution.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b09_4']	若依今意，以此七行為敦信文，則闕此有無一意。	若依今意，以此七行為敦信文，則闕此有無一意。	If we follow the meaning of the present interpretation, taking these seven lines as the text on urging faith, then this one meaning of having or not having is lacking.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b10_10']	頌中有歎法者，從諸佛興出等四難文是，長行中全無。	頌中有歎法者，從諸佛興出等四難文是，長行中全無。	As for the praise of the Dharma in the verse, it is the four difficult passages starting from when the Buddhas appear in the world, which are completely absent in the prose.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b12_17']	次第中云「長行先開三後顯一」者，長行中初云舍利弗我今亦復如是，知諸眾生有種種欲等，豈非施三？	次第中云「長行先開三後顯一」者，長行中初云舍利弗我今亦復如是，知諸眾生有種種欲等，豈非施三？	As for the sequence, it says the prose first opens the three and then reveals the one, the beginning of the prose says Śāriputra, I am also like this, knowing that sentient beings have various desires and so forth, how is this not the bestowal of the three?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b13_16']	次文云，如此皆為得一佛乘，即顯一也。	次文云，如此皆為得一佛乘，即顯一也。	The next passage says, All of this is for the sake of attaining the One Buddha Vehicle, which reveals the One.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b16_3']	頌中初總頌中二行，初行顯實、次行施權，故先云安隱及示佛道，次文乃云我以智慧力知眾生性欲。	頌中初總頌中二行，初行顯實、次行施權，故先云安隱及示佛道，次文乃云我以智慧力知眾生性欲。	In the verse, the first two lines of the general verse, the first line reveals the truth, and the next line bestows the provisional, therefore it first says peace and security and showing the Buddha's path, and the next passage says I know the nature and desires of sentient beings with the power of wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b18_4']	若取別譬文，先五濁中更開為三，初能見眼亦當顯實，次所見火及寢大施小皆屬權也。	若取別譬文，先五濁中更開為三，初能見眼亦當顯實，次所見火及寢大施小皆屬權也。	If we take the separate parables, first within the five turbidities it is further divided into three. First, the eye that can see will also reveal the truth. Next, the fire that is seen and the great teaching hidden and the small teaching given are all expedient means.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b18_17']	若論別譬大意，亦先權後實。	若論別譬大意，亦先權後實。	If we discuss the general meaning of the separate parables, it is also first expedient and then true.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b21_5']	若取總頌，則前行顯實、次行施權，開合中云「初合而不開」者，若得二偈但為總譬作本，故云合而不開。	若取總頌，則前行顯實、次行施權，開合中云「初合而不開」者，若得二偈但為總譬作本，故云合而不開。	If we take the general verse, then the practice in the beginning reveals the truth, and the next practice gives the expedient. In the explanation of the combination and separation, it says first combining without separating. If we obtain the two verses, they only serve as the basis for the general parable, so it says combining without separating.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b22_12']	若以二偈離六，總亦有別，且從合說，故對下譬亦復更分。	若以二偈離六，總亦有別，且從合說，故對下譬亦復更分。	If we separate the two verses from the six, the general also has the specific. We will provisionally follow the combined explanation, so it is further divided in contrast to the following parable.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b25_5']	「五濁文離為四譬本」者，恐文誤，應云「三譬本」，即別四譬中初文復離為三，即能見、所見、驚入，對下譬文仍有四也。	「五濁文離為四譬本」者，恐文誤，應云「三譬本」，即別四譬中初文復離為三，即能見、所見、驚入，對下譬文仍有四也。	The text of the five turbidities is separated into the basis for the four parables - it is feared that the text is mistaken, and it should say the basis for the three parables. It refers to the first text in the specific four parables, which is further divided into three: that which can see, that which is seen, and the startled entry. In contrast to the following parable text, there are still four.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b26_8']	彼以第四廣明見火，合在第二文也，故知但三。	彼以第四廣明見火，合在第二文也，故知但三。	The fourth extensively clarifies seeing the fire, which should be combined in the second text, therefore it is known that there are only three.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b27_15']	次明取捨中云「四段經文為六譬本」者，四段者，別四也。	次明取捨中云「四段經文為六譬本」者，四段者，別四也。	Next, in clarifying acceptance and rejection, it says the four sections of the sutra are the basis for six parables. The four sections refer to the four individual [parables].
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249b28_13']	六譬者，離五濁為三，并下三段即是六也。	六譬者，離五濁為三，并下三段即是六也。	The six parables are the three [parables] of leaving the five turbidities, along with the three sections below, which make six.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c01_6']	「歎法非六譬本」者，於四別中離第四段，出嘆法敦信，非下六譬本也。	「歎法非六譬本」者，於四別中離第四段，出嘆法敦信，非下六譬本也。	The praise of the Dharma is not the basis for the six parables means that within the four individual [parables], leaving the fourth section brings out the praise of the Dharma and urging faith, which is not the basis for the six parables below.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c02_6']	次總別中「初開三顯一」者，即初二行總頌也。	次總別中「初開三顯一」者，即初二行總頌也。	Next, in the general and specific, it says first opening the three and revealing the one refers to the first two lines of the general verse.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c03_1']	「本迹者」，且約迹中論本迹耳。	「本迹者」，且約迹中論本迹耳。	As for the original and traces, it is just about discussing the original and traces within the traces.

This first chapter is separated into three meanings. The eye that can see is the original, the third great compassion is the traces, and the second what is seen is merely the reason for the Buddhas to manifest the traces.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c07_16']	「云云」者，須廣約迹本、久近、今昔、體用等，以簡同異，具如《玄》文六重本迹及前序中已略簡竟。	「云云」者，須廣約迹本、久近、今昔、體用等，以簡同異，具如《玄》文六重本迹及前序中已略簡竟。	And so on means that it is necessary to extensively discuss the traces and roots, the distant and recent, the present and past, the essence and function, etc., to distinguish the similarities and differences, as fully explained in the six levels of the traces in the Profound Text and already briefly distinguished in the preface.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c08_18']	「今謂」下正示義宗，宗旨別故，故云「正是」等也。	「今謂」下正示義宗，宗旨別故，故云「正是」等也。	Now I say below correctly shows the main purport. Since the main purport is different, it is said this is the main point and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c10_4']	「前直法說」下欲破諸師立譬不能盡理，故先騰三周理同。	「前直法說」下欲破諸師立譬不能盡理，故先騰三周理同。	Before, it was directly explained with the Dharma below, wanting to refute the masters' establishment of parables that cannot exhaust the principle, therefore first raising the same principle in the three periods.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c11_12']	次「若作」下辯古譬之失，故云「若作三六十譬，於三周不合」也。	次「若作」下辯古譬之失，故云「若作三六十譬，於三周不合」也。	Next, if below distinguishes the loss of the ancient parables, therefore saying if the three periods are made into thirty or sixty parables, it does not match the three periods.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c13_13']	如前所列瑤三、暢龍各六、光宅有十，然今文非不立於三六等數，但分節盈縮與他不同。	如前所列瑤三、暢龍各六、光宅有十，然今文非不立於三六等數，但分節盈縮與他不同。	As listed above, Yao has three, Chang Long has six each, and Guangzhai has ten. However, the current text is not without establishing the number of three, six, and so on, but the division and contraction are different from others.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c15_12']	言「於三周不合」者，法譬不合已略如上，於宿世文秖可分為二譬三譬，故多不可。	言「於三周不合」者，法譬不合已略如上，於宿世文秖可分為二譬三譬，故多不可。	As for saying it does not match in the three periods, the non-matching of the Dharma and parables has already been briefly mentioned above. In the past life text, it can only be divided into two parables and three parables, so it is mostly not possible.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c19_2']	言「四人信解乖離」者，若對信解秖可總六別四，若對他五三六及今十八，則乖張離分，具如前破光宅十譬，故破古已自立三等，今立三者如下文云。	言「四人信解乖離」者，若對信解秖可總六別四，若對他五三六及今十八，則乖張離分，具如前破光宅十譬，故破古已自立三等，今立三者如下文云。	As for saying the four people's faith and understanding are estranged, if it is compared with faith and understanding, it can only be a total of six and a specific four. If it is compared with the other five, six, and now eighteen, then it is estranged and divided, as fully explained in the previous refutation of Guanhua's ten parables. Therefore, after refuting the ancients, he established three levels himself. The three established now are as explained in the following text.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0249c23_10']	又一時三譬，若為五者如總一別四，若為六者如總別各六，若為十者即總六別四，亦可為十一即總一別十，亦可為十六即總六別十，亦可十八如前十八句也，但本下承上，不相應耳。	又一時三譬，若為五者如總一別四，若為六者如總別各六，若為十者即總六別四，亦可為十一即總一別十，亦可為十六即總六別十，亦可十八如前十八句也，但本下承上，不相應耳。	Moreover, the three parables at one time, if made into five, are like a total of one and a specific four. If made into six, it is like a total of six and a specific six. If made into ten, it is a total of six and a specific four.

Using the provisional to correspond with the real, leading the provisional to enter the real, thus it is said to be opposed. The opposition is only the meaning of stimulus and response.

If in the four individual [meanings], the fourth is divided into three, it is called the six meanings. If the fourth is one and the first is three, it is only called the six parables. If it is said to be the six meanings, it should not be the text of the parables, but only praise the above, therefore it is only called the six meanings.

In this there is earnest faith, and earnest faith is the discernment of falsehood, therefore it is known that the above text cannot be said to be non-existent.

If compared to the parable and past events, although it seems like circulation, it is not circulation. The reason is that people see the words about the future world and think it seems like circulation, so the old interpretation takes it as understanding the meaning.

Therefore, contemplating expedient means, he spoke of arising and ceasing.

Following what one hears and turning it into contemplation is called practice. If it is based on the Hīnayāna, although the time is short, it does not prevent one from going through the stages of inner and outer disciples. Reaching the stage of the highest worldly state is called realization. If one attains the first fruit, it is called entry.

If it is based on the unbridled, it applies to the four. The Tathāgata's teachings are complete. He responds to all who call out to him. Whatever he speaks is none other than transforming others. It is spoken in contrast to his own realization.

Four sentences are further used to explain the two kinds of ghee, which are generally applied to the four capacities hearing the Dharma in various teachings, with different degrees of progress. Therefore, in the first round, only the fourth sentence is in the Lotus Sutra, and the other texts are mostly in the previous four flavors. Now, in the fifth period, it is only compared to the opening of the three and the uniqueness of the Great.

Therefore, the first two are in the past, and the verbal expression is only in the present.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0252b02_4']	昔言雖即通於四味，此指二酥並聞大時，是故得有二索之言。	昔言雖即通於四味，此指二酥並聞大時，是故得有二索之言。	Although the words in the past are generally applicable to the four flavors, this refers to the two kinds of ghee, both of which hear the Great at the time. Therefore, there are words of the two requests.

Generally, they both apply to the two flavors. The potential is obscurely within, and the sentiment moves within, so both flavors are the same. Therefore, it is said to be general.

In the Vaipulya period, although one hears of the inconceivable and is rebuked as not being so, one still has great benefit. Not slandering the rebuke is equivalent to requesting. Therefore, one should know that the principle of not slandering lies in having a request.

Although there is no hope of receiving the teaching, the sentiment is intimate. Even if one does not express it in words, the meaning of requesting gradually becomes urgent. Although the two are different, the potential is distant and the sentiment is close.

The sentiment advances and retreats, and the meaning is equivalent to requesting. This means that the sentiment is tinged with the potential and is slightly more urgent than before. Therefore, when it reaches prajñā, it specifically receives the name of sentiment. When it reaches the understanding, it uses obtaining to reveal the loss. Therefore, it is said, Do you want to ask the World-Honored One if it is a loss or not a loss?

Following the strong, it belongs to the oral faculties. The feelings are also different. In the past, they were only hidden in the mind, but now they assist in manifesting through speech. The three requests all touch the ultimate sage, and the response is also divided into exoteric and esoteric. When the time is ripe, the inner causes are complete.

After that, we go through two flavors and two requests in our minds. But the short parable contains the meaning of the long, reaching to the beginning of the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, in the parable, the children go to their father and ask for a vehicle, and he gives it to them and also bestows the great. Therefore, the meaning of the parable includes the two kinds of cream. The meaning of the chapter on the Parable of the Wise and Foolish is only revealed in the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, the text of the parable contains the meaning of three requests. How can it be compared to the Guangzhai [school]?

According to the Buddha's original intention, although they are not false, they are called provisional and false in comparison with the true.

Although the beginning of the chapter also includes the text of the first week, the explanation of the title is based on the meaning of the second week, so it says the lower class has not yet reached and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a08_6']	初總為三：	初總為三：	The first general is divided into three:
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a08_18']	先字訓，次釋訓，三來意。	先字訓，次釋訓，三來意。	First, the interpretation of the characters, second, the explanation of the interpretation, and third, the purpose.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a13_8']	」既兩字雙題應有小別，具如釋訓，故以比況曉訓時眾，此謂界內人中車宅，彼謂界外佛事迷悟，淺深可知。	」既兩字雙題應有小別，具如釋訓，故以比況曉訓時眾，此謂界內人中車宅，彼謂界外佛事迷悟，淺深可知。	Since the two characters are both titled, there should be a slight difference. As explained in the commentary, the present time is compared to a carriage and house within the realm of humans, while the future is compared to the Buddha's affairs outside the realm, with the difference between delusion and enlightenment being easy to understand.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a14_16']	彼但佛乘深義唯一，故迷之與悟唯小對圓，樹扇風月唯圓教理。	彼但佛乘深義唯一，故迷之與悟唯小對圓，樹扇風月唯圓教理。	In the future, the profound meaning of the Buddha's vehicle will be singular, so delusion and enlightenment will only be contrasted with the perfect teaching. The wind and moon of the tree fanning will only be the principle of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a15_12']	「前廣」下明來意者，亦是結前生後。	「前廣」下明來意者，亦是結前生後。	The previous extensive explanation below clarifies the intention, which is also a conclusion of the previous and the arising of the next.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a18_8']	初句結前，「中下」下生後，故知機雖無已，還待不已悲智中機當生，更動樹舉扇使風月意彰，然法說實相，何隱何顯？	初句結前，「中下」下生後，故知機雖無已，還待不已悲智中機當生，更動樹舉扇使風月意彰，然法說實相，何隱何顯？	The first sentence concludes the previous, while the middling and inferior below gives rise to the next. Therefore, it is known that although the capacity is not yet, it still awaits the arising of the capacity in the middle of compassion and wisdom, and further moves the tree and raises the fan to make the meaning of the wind and moon manifest. However, in the Dharma explanation of reality, what is hidden and what is revealed?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a20_11']	如長風靡息、空月常懸，但中下之徒大機未啟、蔽情猶壅謂月隱風停，逗茲二途須舉扇動樹。	如長風靡息、空月常懸，但中下之徒大機未啟、蔽情猶壅謂月隱風停，逗茲二途須舉扇動樹。	Just like the long wind never ceasing and the empty moon always hanging, but the middling and inferior ones have not yet awakened to the great capacity and their deluded emotions are still obstructed, thinking that the moon is hidden and the wind stops. In response to these two situations, it is necessary to raise the fan and move the tree.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a21_11']	因緣等四大旨咸然，故以二字總冠諸釋。	因緣等四大旨咸然，故以二字總冠諸釋。	The meaning of the four great principles such as causes and conditions is all the same, so the two characters are used to collectively crown all the explanations.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a22_12']	次別釋者，初因緣中並以世四法喻一實四法。	次別釋者，初因緣中並以世四法喻一實四法。	Next, for the specific explanations, in the section on causes and conditions, the four dharmas of the one reality are all compared to the four dharmas of the world.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a23_11']	初世界中直云世法者，以世冠三故也。	初世界中直云世法者，以世冠三故也。	In the first section on the world, it simply says worldly dharmas, because the word world crowns the next three.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a24_3']	聞譬生喜名世界也。	聞譬生喜名世界也。	Hearing the parable and giving rise to joy is called the world.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253a29_4']	「是故」下三皆由聞譬而生喜等，因於曾有世間父子，今聞譬說我佛真子，聲聞與佛天性不殊，唯在今經故未曾有，所以密遣之日尚無傭作之心，領財之時豈生己物之念？	「是故」下三皆由聞譬而生喜等，因於曾有世間父子，今聞譬說我佛真子，聲聞與佛天性不殊，唯在今經故未曾有，所以密遣之日尚無傭作之心，領財之時豈生己物之念？	Therefore below, the next three all arise from hearing the parable and giving rise to joy, etc. Because of the past worldly father and son, now hearing the explanation of the parable, I am the true child of the Buddha. The nature of the śrāvakas and the Buddha is no different, only in this sūtra it is unprecedented. Therefore, on the day of being secretly sent, there was still no thought of being hired, and when receiving the wealth, how could there be the thought of it being one's own property?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b03_17']	特由天性相關，遂荷領知之澤，爾前憂悔至此方除，譬說之時乃名真子，今始得悟踊躍彌加，此指聞譬生於實喜，即信解初歡喜之文，故大小兩乘皆名歡喜。	特由天性相關，遂荷領知之澤，爾前憂悔至此方除，譬說之時乃名真子，今始得悟踊躍彌加，此指聞譬生於實喜，即信解初歡喜之文，故大小兩乘皆名歡喜。	It is especially due to the connection of natural affinity that I have received the favor of being known. My previous worries and regrets have only now been removed. When the parables were spoken, I was then called a true son. Now I have finally attained enlightenment and my joy is even greater. This refers to the joy born from hearing the parables, which is the text of initial joy in the chapter on belief and understanding. Therefore, both the lesser and greater vehicles are called joy.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b04_20']	次為人中云「世生法」者，即資具也，故云珍玩。	次為人中云「世生法」者，即資具也，故云珍玩。	Next, for benefiting others, it says worldly dharmas that give rise to life refers to the necessities, thus it says precious toys.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b06_16']	出世生法即三乘法，生善中最豈過於此，故昔三車妙珍玩攝，汝等所行是菩薩道。	出世生法即三乘法，生善中最豈過於此，故昔三車妙珍玩攝，汝等所行是菩薩道。	The dharmas that give rise to life in the supramundane world refer to the teachings of the Three Vehicles. Among the best of the dharmas that give rise to goodness, is there anything surpassing this? Therefore, the three carts of the past are included in the precious toys. The practice you are engaged in is the bodhisattva path.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b07_11']	世滅法者，宅內眾災可免離也。	世滅法者，宅內眾災可免離也。	The dharmas that extinguish in the world refer to the various calamities within the house that can be escaped from.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b08_3']	出世滅法者，謂惑斷也。	出世滅法者，謂惑斷也。	The dharmas that extinguish in the supramundane world refer to the severing of delusions.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b09_12']	無漏述昔、除憂指今，拔苦本在等與大車，除惡之極莫若於此。	無漏述昔、除憂指今，拔苦本在等與大車，除惡之極莫若於此。	Without outflows refers to the past, and removing worries points to the present. The root of removing suffering lies in equally bestowing the great cart. There is nothing more extreme than this in removing evil.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b10_7']	昔破見思，通論於今莫非除惡。	昔破見思，通論於今莫非除惡。	In the past, breaking through the views and attachments, in general discussion, now is none other than eliminating evil.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b10_18']	世不生滅者，即大車也。	世不生滅者，即大車也。	The world that is not born and does not perish is precisely the great vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b11_15']	父之本有故不生，至處不壞故不滅。	父之本有故不生，至處不壞故不滅。	Because it is the original possession of the father, it is not born. Because it does not perish when reaching its destination, it does not perish.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b13_1']	出世不生不滅者，性德本有故不生，修得果常故不滅。	出世不生不滅者，性德本有故不生，修得果常故不滅。	The world-transcending that is not born and does not perish is because the nature-born virtues originally exist, it is not born. Because the fruition of cultivation is permanent, it does not perish.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b15_14']	以信解中聞譬歡喜等，是故四悉俱譬父子，然前之三悉似寄施權，第一義悉方約開顯，當知三悉即第一義之弄引也。	以信解中聞譬歡喜等，是故四悉俱譬父子，然前之三悉似寄施權，第一義悉方約開顯，當知三悉即第一義之弄引也。	Because in the stage of faith and understanding, one hears the parables with joy, etc., therefore the four aspects are all parables of father and son. However, the first three aspects seem to be entrusted to the provisional teachings, and the first principle aspect is only about revealing the true. One should know that the three aspects are the prelude to the first principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b16_18']	故引先心各好及以火宅免難，若開顯已無非大車。	故引先心各好及以火宅免難，若開顯已無非大車。	Therefore, it cites the original mind of each person liking different things and escaping from the burning house. If the true is revealed, there is nothing that is not a great vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b18_11']	又四悉各一法一譬，法中或取法說身子領解之文，並且助成其語耳。	又四悉各一法一譬，法中或取法說身子領解之文，並且助成其語耳。	Moreover, each of the four aspects has one dharma and one parable. In the dharma, it may take the dharma explanation of Śāriputra's understanding, and generally assists in forming its words.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b22_15']	若直銷兩字何足題品，故結云一音巧喻，此則遮那始終一音，一音唯實巧喻兼權，權引歸實故不同舊純用一音，故譬義含因緣等四，若不爾者，如何銷於小車大車火宅父舍？	若直銷兩字何足題品，故結云一音巧喻，此則遮那始終一音，一音唯實巧喻兼權，權引歸實故不同舊純用一音，故譬義含因緣等四，若不爾者，如何銷於小車大車火宅父舍？	If we simply explain the two characters, how can it be enough to title the chapter? Therefore, it is concluded that the one sound is a skillful analogy. This means that from beginning to end, Śākyamuni uses only one sound. The one sound is only the real truth, while the skillful analogy also includes the provisional. The provisional leads to the real, so it is not the same as the old [interpretation] that only uses one sound. Therefore, the analogy includes the four [meanings] such as the immediate cause, etc. If it were not so, how could we explain the small cart, the large cart, the burning house, and the father's house?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b23_5']	「中下得益」者，問：	「中下得益」者，問：	As for the benefit for those of middling and lower capacities, it is asked:
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b23_14']	下根未悟何以云益？	下根未悟何以云益？	Since those of lower faculties have not yet awakened, why is it said that they benefit?
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b23_16']	答：	答：	The answer is:
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b26_9']	法譬通被，中下自迷，故下根聞法譬、中根聞法說，雖未顯悟非無冥益，故至譬及宿世獲悟，故約教等三咸須約譬。	法譬通被，中下自迷，故下根聞法譬、中根聞法說，雖未顯悟非無冥益，故至譬及宿世獲悟，故約教等三咸須約譬。	The Dharma and the analogy are universally applied. Those of middling and lower capacities are self-deluded. Therefore, those of lower faculties hear the Dharma and the analogy, while those of middling faculties hear the explanation of the Dharma. Although they have not yet manifestly awakened, they are not without the benefit of obscurity. Therefore, when they reach the analogy and the past, they attain awakening. Therefore, the three such as the teachings, etc. must all be based on the analogy.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b27_13']	譬既三車一車今昔相對，法亦若權若實並列偏圓。	譬既三車一車今昔相對，法亦若權若實並列偏圓。	Since the analogy has three carts and one cart, the present and the past are contrasted. The Dharma is also like this. Whether provisional or real, both the biased and the perfect are listed.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253b28_4']	若不爾者，開何所開？	若不爾者，開何所開？	If it were not so, what would be opened up by the opening [of the analogy]?

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c03_11']	四教譬中初三藏云「菩薩駕牛」等者，此菩薩從初至後皆化他故，最得其名。	四教譬中初三藏云「菩薩駕牛」等者，此菩薩從初至後皆化他故，最得其名。	In the four teachings and parables, the first Tripiṭaka says the bodhisattva drives the ox and so on. This bodhisattva, from the beginning to the end, all transforms others, therefore most obtains its name.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c04_14', 'ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c07_14']	通教譬云「三人同畏」等者，三藏二乘理亦應爾。🔽為對始終一向利他，是故彼二且云自濟，此教緣覺自他兼益勝於聲聞，故云「並馳並顧」，悲劣菩薩故有並言，自行故馳兼他乃顧。	通教譬云「三人同畏」等者，三藏二乘理亦應爾。 為對始終一向利他，是故彼二且云自濟，此教緣覺自他兼益勝於聲聞，故云「並馳並顧」，悲劣菩薩故有並言，自行故馳兼他乃顧。	The parables of the Shared Teaching say the three people fear the same and so on. The two vehicles of the Tripiṭaka also should be so in principle.🔽In order to contrast with always benefiting others from beginning to end, therefore those two for now say self-benefit. The causes and conditions of this teaching, the pratyekabuddha, benefit both self and others, surpassing the śrāvakas, therefore it says racing and looking back. Because the compassion of the bodhisattva is inferior, there is the word together. Because of self-practice, therefore it races. Because of benefiting others, therefore it looks back.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c09_13']	菩薩自行既滿，唯以利物為懷，是故但云「全群而出」別教中初斥兩教三乘俱近。	菩薩自行既滿，唯以利物為懷，是故但云「全群而出」別教中初斥兩教三乘俱近。	When the self-practice of the bodhisattva is complete, only benefiting beings is in mind, therefore it only says leaving the herd. In the Distinct Teaching, first refuting the two teachings and the three vehicles are both close.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c10_10']	次「菩薩」去正釋，對前所列句句並決。	次「菩薩」去正釋，對前所列句句並決。	Next, from bodhisattvas is the correct explanation, corresponding to the previous listed phrases, all decisively explained.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c11_2']	約大象說故云「邊底」。	約大象說故云「邊底」。	Speaking in terms of the great elephant, therefore it says edge and bottom.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c11_19']	三「大品」下證，對前二教二乘簡也。	三「大品」下證，對前二教二乘簡也。	Third, from the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra is the evidence, corresponding to the previous two teachings and the two vehicles, it is distinguished.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c14_1']	通教菩薩對通二乘，斷證既同略無形斥，故知是別菩薩斥兩二乘，故以螢對日為別作譬也。	通教菩薩對通二乘，斷證既同略無形斥，故知是別菩薩斥兩二乘，故以螢對日為別作譬也。	The bodhisattvas of the Shared Teaching, corresponding to the two vehicles of the Shared Teaching, since the elimination and realization are the same, there is no explicit refutation, therefore it is known that it is the bodhisattvas of the Distinct Teaching refuting the two vehicles of the two teachings, therefore using a firefly to correspond to the sun is used as a separate analogy.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c15_18']	準義簡譬，秖應於牛車以簡菩薩，以由證經幸有三乘俱異之譬，兩教三乘譬外。	準義簡譬，秖應於牛車以簡菩薩，以由證經幸有三乘俱異之譬，兩教三乘譬外。	According to the meaning, the analogy should only be used to distinguish the bodhisattvas in the ox-drawn cart, because the realized sūtra fortunately has the analogy of the three vehicles all being different, and the two teachings and three vehicles are outside the analogy.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c17_1']	又有獨菩薩譬如大象，及以螢日用斥二乘。	又有獨菩薩譬如大象，及以螢日用斥二乘。	There is also the unique bodhisattva analogy like the great elephant, and using fireflies and the sun to refute the two vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c19_6']	又「始見」去，圓教中先指華嚴，「及為未入」下明今經意，二處化事皆不須譬，即華嚴利根及法華上周。	又「始見」去，圓教中先指華嚴，「及為未入」下明今經意，二處化事皆不須譬，即華嚴利根及法華上周。	Again, from first seeing, in the Perfect Teaching, first pointing to the Flower Ornament Sutra, and below and for those who have not yet entered, clarifying the meaning of the present sūtra, the two places of conversion both do not need analogies, referring to the sharp faculties of the Flower Ornament Sutra and the upper period of the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0253c21_17']	次「如今」下明二處理等，雖即化儀前後而始終理一，始即華嚴、今謂法華，秖緣慧如是故理等，故云「無二無異」。	次「如今」下明二處理等，雖即化儀前後而始終理一，始即華嚴、今謂法華，秖緣慧如是故理等，故云「無二無異」。	Next, from now below, it clarifies that the two processes are equal. Although the methods of transformation are sequential, the principle is one from beginning to end. The beginning refers to the Flower Ornament Sutra, and now refers to the Lotus Sutra. It is only because the wisdom is like this that the principles are equal, so it says no two, no difference.

I used to dwell in the stage of no-more-learning together with them, but they received the written record while I alone did not receive it. Having initially heard the brief explanation, I already had doubts about whether it was the ultimate fruit or a skillful means.

['ZH_T34_1719_05c:0255a06_16']	以由不知小法性外別有妙理菩薩得之故也。	以由不知小法性外別有妙理菩薩得之故也。	This is because one does not know that outside of the nature of dharmas of the Lesser Vehicle there is a separate wondrous principle that the bodhisattvas attain.

The Buddha's approval of Kāśyapa and the teaching of the treatises are the same, which is the meaning of this.

The reality of the Middle Treatise is attained by the three vehicles together. This is the nature of dharmas of the Shared Teaching of the three vehicles, which is also no different from the nature of dharmas of the Tripiṭaka.

Although one will not die if one simply gives rise to the Mahayana mind, now the distinction is only in the perfect. One should know that the causes do not go beyond cause, effect, and vows and practices. Practice refers to the six pāramitās, and vows refer to the four grave offenses. Therefore, in the Buddha Land Treatise, the causes are generally of three kinds:

In terms of the essence, it is only in the first two. Accomplishing enlightenment is precisely the fruition.

Anyone who sees or hears it is a realm that gives rise to doubts. Doubts arise from the realm, and because of doubts one regrets. Now, hearing the doctrinal explanation, one regrets missing the two periods of parables. Moreover, because of the extensive explanation, all doubts and regrets are completely removed. Because in the past one was completely excluded, both meanings are related.

The text does not come from the three kinds of wisdom, which are general. Therefore, it says the meaning is exhausted and the principle is revealed. This is because it is the principle of principle.
