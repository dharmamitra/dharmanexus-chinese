['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b04_2']	大覺世尊從本垂跡，為欲開示眾生佛之知見令其悟入，於是乘時利見而大有為焉。	大覺世尊從本垂跡，為欲開示眾生佛之知見令其悟入，於是乘時利見而大有為焉。	The World-Honored One of Great Enlightenment, from the original, manifested traces, in order to open and reveal the Buddha's knowledge and insight to sentient beings, enabling them to awaken and enter, thus riding on the times, benefiting by seeing, and greatly having activity.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b05_5']	經曰「諸有所作常為一事，唯以佛之知見示悟眾生。	經曰「諸有所作常為一事，唯以佛之知見示悟眾生。	The sūtra says, In all that is done, it is always for one thing, only using the Buddha's knowledge and insight to show and awaken sentient beings.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b11_9']	」則知出生示滅、一代聲教半滿雖殊，莫不皆使諸有凡庸自悟己心，與十方如來法界含靈體性平等無有差異，具足無量河沙勝德、包攝一切世出世法，清淨本然廣大無際十方法界微塵剎土大地山河依正因果，悉是我輩自心中物，猶如一漚浮于大海亦如片雲點太清裹。	」則知出生示滅、一代聲教半滿雖殊，莫不皆使諸有凡庸自悟己心，與十方如來法界含靈體性平等無有差異，具足無量河沙勝德、包攝一切世出世法，清淨本然廣大無際十方法界微塵剎土大地山河依正因果，悉是我輩自心中物，猶如一漚浮于大海亦如片雲點太清裹。	Then we know that whether manifesting birth or extinction, the teachings of the lifetime, whether gradual or sudden, are all meant to enable all ordinary people to awaken to their own minds, with the essence of the mind of the tathāgatas of the ten directions and all sentient beings equally, without distinction, endowed with immeasurable excellent qualities of the sand of the Ganges, encompassing all worldly and supramundane dharmas, originally pure, vast and boundless, the great earth, mountains, rivers, the lands of the ten directions, and the causes and effects of the dependent and the principal, all being the things of our own minds, like a single bubble floating on the great ocean, or like a single cloud dotting the vast clear sky.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b12_15']	即下經云「是心作佛、是心是佛，諸佛正遍知海從心想生。	即下經云「是心作佛、是心是佛，諸佛正遍知海從心想生。	The sūtra below says, This mind creates buddhas, this mind is buddhas. The ocean of the correct and universal knowledge of the buddhas arises from the mind.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b14_5']	」當知此心即是菩提涅槃元清淨體，即是大乘一實境界非他法也。	」當知此心即是菩提涅槃元清淨體，即是大乘一實境界非他法也。	We should know that this mind is the originally pure essence of bodhi and nirvāṇa, the realm of the one true Dharma of the Great Vehicle, and not some other dharma.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b16_6']	故《占察經》曰「一實境界者，謂眾生心體從本已來不生不滅自性清淨，圓滿十方、究竟一相。	故《占察經》曰「一實境界者，謂眾生心體從本已來不生不滅自性清淨，圓滿十方、究竟一相。	Therefore, the Zhancha Jing says, The one true realm means that the essence of sentient beings' minds, from the very beginning, is unborn and unceasing, intrinsically pure, perfect throughout the ten directions, and ultimately of one characteristic.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b18_3']	」但以眾生無明癡暗熏習因緣妄現境界，令生念著計我我所，沒溺生死不自知覺。	」但以眾生無明癡暗熏習因緣妄現境界，令生念著計我我所，沒溺生死不自知覺。	 However, due to the causes and conditions of sentient beings' deluded and ignorant perfuming, false realms appear, causing them to give rise to thoughts and attachments, to grasp at self and what belongs to self, and to be submerged in birth and death without knowing or realizing it.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b20_5']	我佛如來先覺此心，憫諸未悟，慈悲方便演說諸經，《華嚴》頓示、鹿園漸誘，歸源無二方便多門。	我佛如來先覺此心，憫諸未悟，慈悲方便演說諸經，《華嚴》頓示、鹿園漸誘，歸源無二方便多門。	Our Buddha, the Tathāgata, first awakened to this mind and, out of compassion for those who have not yet awakened, skillfully expounded various sūtras. The Huayan Sūtra directly reveals it, while the Deer Park gradually guides [beings]. The source is non-dual, but the skillful means have many gates.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b20_20']	經云「小智樂小法，不自信作佛。	經云「小智樂小法，不自信作佛。	The sūtra says, Those of little wisdom delight in the lesser teachings and do not have confidence in becoming Buddhas.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b21_14']	」又云「雖說種種道，其實為佛乘。	」又云「雖說種種道，其實為佛乘。	It also says, Although various paths are taught, in reality it is for the sake of the Buddha-vehicle.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b22_15']	」或於此土破惑證真，則運自力，故談大小諸經；	」或於此土破惑證真，則運自力，故談大小諸經；	Some, in this land, destroy delusions and realize truth, and thus employ their own power, expounding the various sūtras of the Great and Lesser Vehicles;
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b23_16']	或往他方聞法悟道，須憑他力，故說往生淨土。	或往他方聞法悟道，須憑他力，故說往生淨土。	Or, going to other places to hear the Dharma and awaken to the Way, one must rely on the power of others, so it is said to be rebirth in the Pure Land.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b24_15']	彼此雖異，莫非方便，令悟自心洞達諸法。	彼此雖異，莫非方便，令悟自心洞達諸法。	Although this is different from that, it is all a skillful means to enable one to realize one's own mind and thoroughly understand all dharmas.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b25_16']	然後發大乘意、修菩提道，上求下化究竟成佛。	然後發大乘意、修菩提道，上求下化究竟成佛。	Then, one gives rise to the intention of the Great Vehicle and cultivates the path to enlightenment, seeking the highest above and transforming those below, ultimately becoming a Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279b28_4']	以智慧故不住生死、以慈悲故不住涅槃，歷微塵剎示生唱滅說法度生，眾生無盡，行願身土亦無有盡。	以智慧故不住生死、以慈悲故不住涅槃，歷微塵剎示生唱滅說法度生，眾生無盡，行願身土亦無有盡。	Because of wisdom, one does not dwell in saṃsāra; because of compassion, one does not dwell in nirvāṇa. One traverses the subtle dust-like lands, manifesting birth and proclaiming extinction, teaching the Dharma to liberate beings. As sentient beings are inexhaustible, the practices, vows, body, and lands are also inexhaustible.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c01_1']	《華嚴》云「我知十方一切諸佛，畢竟無有般涅槃者，唯除為欲調伏眾生而示現耳。	《華嚴》云「我知十方一切諸佛，畢竟無有般涅槃者，唯除為欲調伏眾生而示現耳。	The Huayan says, I know that all Buddhas of the ten directions have no final nirvāṇa, except for manifesting it in order to subdue sentient beings.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c01_21']	」《楞伽》亦云「無有佛涅槃，亦無涅槃佛。	」《楞伽》亦云「無有佛涅槃，亦無涅槃佛。	The Laṅkāvatāra also says, There is no Buddha nirvāṇa, nor is there nirvāṇa in a Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c02_16']	」是謂出世大事因緣，十方皆爾，豈獨釋迦？	」是謂出世大事因緣，十方皆爾，豈獨釋迦？	This is called the great cause and condition for leaving the world. It is so in the ten directions. How could it be exclusive to Śākyamuni?
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c03_6']	教法所興，在此而已。	教法所興，在此而已。	The rise of the teaching is just in this.

['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c05_12']	韋提機發、淨土緣興，故使闍王公為逆害，幽禁父母苦切憂愁，遙望耆山請佛求救。	韋提機發、淨土緣興，故使闍王公為逆害，幽禁父母苦切憂愁，遙望耆山請佛求救。	Because Vaidehī's potential was activated and the Pure Land conditions arose, King Ajātaśatru committed regicide, imprisoned his parents, and they suffered greatly. From afar, they looked to Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, requested the Buddha, and sought rescue.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c07_9']	大悲憐愍即赴幽宮，先陳三種淨福以為兼濟之緣，後說十六妙觀正示往生之術。	大悲憐愍即赴幽宮，先陳三種淨福以為兼濟之緣，後說十六妙觀正示往生之術。	The Greatly Compassionate One took pity on them and immediately went to the inner palace. First, he expounded the three kinds of pure blessings as the conditions for universal salvation, and later he taught the sixteen wonderful contemplations, correctly demonstrating the method for rebirth.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c07_19']	今括諸文，略陳十意。	今括諸文，略陳十意。	Now, summarizing the various texts, I briefly present ten points.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c08_14']	一、為愍眾生忍受眾苦無由脫故。	一、為愍眾生忍受眾苦無由脫故。	First, it is out of pity for sentient beings who endure various sufferings and have no means of liberation.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c09_17']	經云「若佛滅後，諸眾生等濁惡不善五苦所逼」等。	經云「若佛滅後，諸眾生等濁惡不善五苦所逼」等。	The sutra says, After the Buddha's extinction, sentient beings will be defiled, evil, and oppressed by the five sufferings, and so forth.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c10_19']	又云「為未來世一切大眾欲脫苦者，說此觀地法。	又云「為未來世一切大眾欲脫苦者，說此觀地法。	It also says, For the sake of all the great assemblies in the future who wish to escape suffering, I will teach this method of contemplating the ground.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c11_12']	」二、為愍眾生為業纏縛無由解故。	」二、為愍眾生為業纏縛無由解故。	Second, it is out of pity for sentient beings who are bound by karma and have no means of release.

['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c13_9']	三、為愍眾生煩惱障重不能斷故。	三、為愍眾生煩惱障重不能斷故。	Third, out of compassion for sentient beings whose afflictive hindrances are heavy and who are unable to eliminate them.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c14_19']	經云「如來今者為未來世一切眾生為煩惱賊之所害者，說清淨業。	經云「如來今者為未來世一切眾生為煩惱賊之所害者，說清淨業。	The sutra says, The Tathāgata, for the sake of all sentient beings in the future who are harmed by the thief of afflictions, speaks of pure karma.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c15_14']	」四、為愍眾生福德淺薄受貧苦故。	」四、為愍眾生福德淺薄受貧苦故。	Fourth, out of compassion for sentient beings whose merit and virtue are shallow and who suffer from poverty.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c16_15']	經云「但想佛像得無量福，況復觀佛具足身相。	經云「但想佛像得無量福，況復觀佛具足身相。	The sutra says, Merely contemplating the Buddha's image brings immeasurable blessings, let alone contemplating the Buddha's complete physical characteristics.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c17_17']	」又云「如此菩薩，但聞其名獲無量福，何況諦觀。	」又云「如此菩薩，但聞其名獲無量福，何況諦觀。	It also says, Such bodhisattvas, merely hearing his name brings immeasurable blessings, let alone contemplating him in detail.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c18_11']	」五、為愍眾生隨邪背正去佛遠故。	」五、為愍眾生隨邪背正去佛遠故。	Fifth, out of compassion for sentient beings who follow the false, turn their backs on the true, and are far from the Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c19_10']	經云「若念佛者，當坐道場生諸佛家」等。	經云「若念佛者，當坐道場生諸佛家」等。	The sutra says, If one thinks of the Buddha, one will sit on the site of enlightenment and be born in the family of the buddhas.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c20_7']	六、為令眾生離諸染著住清淨境界故。	六、為令眾生離諸染著住清淨境界故。	Sixth, in order to enable sentient beings to leave all defilements and abide in the pure realm.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c21_7']	經云「若念佛者，當知此人是人中分陀利華。	經云「若念佛者，當知此人是人中分陀利華。	The sutra says, If one thinks of the Buddha, one should know that this person is a lotus flower among humans.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c21_20']	」七、為令眾生心易得定故。	」七、為令眾生心易得定故。	Seventh, in order to make it easy for sentient beings to attain concentration.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c23_9']	經云「應當專心繫念一處想於西方，若不定指一方則三昧難成故。	經云「應當專心繫念一處想於西方，若不定指一方則三昧難成故。	The sutra says, One should single-mindedly focus the mind on one place and think of the Western Direction. If one does not point to one direction, then samādhi is difficult to accomplish.

['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c24_23']	九、為令見身見無量壽佛故此二皆下經文。	九、為令見身見無量壽佛故此二皆下經文。	Ninth, in order to make one see the body and see Amitāyus Buddha. These two are both below the sutra text.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c25_10']	十、為令眾生疾成佛故。	十、為令眾生疾成佛故。	Tenth, in order to make sentient beings quickly attain Buddhahood.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c27_8']	下云「心想佛時，是心即是三十二相」等，即《彌陀經》云「生彼國者皆得不退阿耨菩提」。	下云「心想佛時，是心即是三十二相」等，即《彌陀經》云「生彼國者皆得不退阿耨菩提」。	Below it says, When the mind thinks of the Buddha, this mind is the thirty-two marks, and so on. The Amitābha Sūtra says, Those who are born in that land will all attain the stage of nonretrogression to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c28_17']	佛意幽深，凡情罔測，且用十意括示大途，則一經興致咬如指掌矣。	佛意幽深，凡情罔測，且用十意括示大途，則一經興致咬如指掌矣。	The Buddha's intention is profound, and ordinary people cannot fathom it. If one uses these ten meanings to roughly indicate the main points, then the purpose of the entire sutra can be understood as if it were in the palm of one's hand.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0279c29_10']	第二、攝教分齊，有三：	第二、攝教分齊，有三：	Second, the scope of the teachings can be divided into three:

['ZH_T37_1754_001:0280a03_6']	初、娑婆入道教觀。	初、娑婆入道教觀。	First, the teachings and contemplations for entering the Way in the Saha world.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0280a05_2']	娑婆五濁，惑業重輕、根性差別，在機既雜，教亦不純，故有大小殊科、偏圓異徹。	娑婆五濁，惑業重輕、根性差別，在機既雜，教亦不純，故有大小殊科、偏圓異徹。	In the five turbidities of the Saha world, afflictions and karma are heavy or light, and the capacities of sentient beings vary. Since the capacities of sentient beings are mixed, the teachings are also not pure. Therefore, there are distinctions between the Great and Small Vehicles, and differences between the partial and perfect teachings.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0280a06_10']	經論宗師古今判教，互有不同、迭相廢立，廣在他文不可備敘。	經論宗師古今判教，互有不同、迭相廢立，廣在他文不可備敘。	The ancient and modern masters of the sūtras and treatises have different interpretations of the teachings, and they have mutually negated and established each other. They are extensively discussed in other texts and cannot be fully described here.

Although those born there are divided into nine grades, all of them give rise to the unsurpassed aspiration for enlightenment. Upon reaching there, they all attain the wonderful fruit of nonretrogression in their progress toward enlightenment. Therefore, the Treatise on Rebirth says, Those of the two vehicles will not be born there.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0280a11_1']	雖有聲聞弟子，皆是先發大心，暫履權乘、不住小果。	雖有聲聞弟子，皆是先發大心，暫履權乘、不住小果。	Although there are disciples of the two vehicles, they are all those who first gave rise to the aspiration for enlightenment, temporarily practicing the provisional teachings without dwelling in the small fruits.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0280a12_4']	是知二土立教純雜不同，則淨土諸經不勞簡判也。	是知二土立教純雜不同，則淨土諸經不勞簡判也。	Thus, we know that the establishment of teachings in the two lands is different in terms of purity and mixture, and therefore the scriptures of the Pure Land do not need to be classified.
['ZH_T37_1754_001:0280a12_11']	二、大小漸頓。	二、大小漸頓。	Second, gradual and sudden teachings of the great and small vehicles.

As for gradual and sudden entry into realization, this is the sudden teaching.
