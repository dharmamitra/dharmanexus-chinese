['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000b28_19']	以因緣有三種，各破不同故。	以因緣有三種，各破不同故。	004	Because there are three kinds of dependent origination, each breaking down differently.
['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000c01_6']	一者三世因緣破斷常，三世相續故不斷，三世迭謝故不常。	一者三世因緣破斷常，三世相續故不斷，三世迭謝故不常。	004	First, the dependent origination of the three periods breaks down permanence and annihilation, because the three periods continue and are not annihilated, and because the three periods alternate and are not permanent.
['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000c04_8']	二者二世因緣破我，謂現未二世具十二緣，於父生愛、於母生瞋名為無明，父遺體時謂是己有名之為行，從識支去至老死支與三世同。	二者二世因緣破我，謂現未二世具十二緣，於父生愛、於母生瞋名為無明，父遺體時謂是己有名之為行，從識支去至老死支與三世同。	004	Second, the dependent origination of the two periods breaks down the self, referring to the twelve links of dependent origination in the present and future two periods. Affection for the father is called ignorance, and hatred for the mother is called karmic formations. When the father's semen is present, it is called consciousness. From the link of consciousness up to old age and death, it is the same as the three periods.
['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000c05_1']	三者一念破性，如下記文。	三者一念破性，如下記文。	004	Third, the dependent origination of a single thought breaks down inherent nature, as explained in the following text.

['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000c17_9']	又此五六但是能治，能不孤立，對所得名。	又此五六但是能治，能不孤立，對所得名。	004	Moreover, these five and six are only the means of treatment. The means cannot stand alone, and are named in contrast to what is attained.

['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000c22_8']	今約觀門，別有所對，故以止門在數息方便中各隨義便止，即不念數隨凝寂其心也。	今約觀門，別有所對，故以止門在數息方便中各隨義便止，即不念數隨凝寂其心也。	004	Now, in terms of the observation gate, there is a separate correspondence, so the gate of stopping is in the expedient means of counting the breath. Stopping according to the meaning is to stop the mind in stillness by not thinking of counting or following.
['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000c23_8']	以約數隨而修止故，故今以止門在數息中。	以約數隨而修止故，故今以止門在數息中。	004	Because stopping is cultivated based on counting and following, therefore the gate of stopping is now in the counting of the breath.

['ZH_T39_1801_004:1000c28_15']	念佛既通三身，今以念法身當淨門也。	念佛既通三身，今以念法身當淨門也。	004	Since mindfulness of the Buddha encompasses the three bodies, now take mindfulness of the Dharma body as the gate of purity.

The initial and sustained thought in a clear and sharp mind, which means that when cultivating concentration, there is no specific object among the three poisons, but the things that are the objects are clearly and distinctly known.

The method of counting the breath is to count in a calm and focused mind, which can treat sharpness.
['ZH_T39_1801_004:1001a15_19']	半昏半明者應教令隨，隨息出入則心常依息，若但數息即有扶昏之失，若但觀息亦有扶亂之失，不明善對治也。	半昏半明者應教令隨，隨息出入則心常依息，若但數息即有扶昏之失，若但觀息亦有扶亂之失，不明善對治也。	004	For those who are half dull and half sharp, they should be taught to follow the breath as it comes in and out, so that the mind always relies on the breath. If one only counts the breath, there is the fault of supporting dullness. If one only observes the breath, there is also the fault of supporting chaos. It is not clear how to skillfully treat these.
['ZH_T39_1801_004:1001a17_17']	三昏沈者應教觀息，求其根原，出無分散、入無積聚，不見定相心眼即開，破於昏沈。	三昏沈者應教觀息，求其根原，出無分散、入無積聚，不見定相心眼即開，破於昏沈。	004	For those who are very dull, they should be taught to observe the breath and seek its root.
