['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a09_6']	梵大師賜紫沙門臣法護等奉　詔譯6 觀染法染者品觀染法染者品第六復次有異宗言：	梵大師賜紫沙門臣法護等奉　詔譯6 觀染法染者品觀染法染者品第六復次有異宗言：	Chapter 6: Examination of the Defiled Dharmas and the Defiled One Next, there is a different school that says:
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a10_15']	於勝義諦中諸界處等性與無性有所知解，由彼雜染成其有性。	於勝義諦中諸界處等性與無性有所知解，由彼雜染成其有性。	In the ultimate truth, the natures and non-natures of the elements, sense bases, etc. are understood, because they become existent due to their defilement.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a11_1']	如佛所言：	如佛所言：	As the Buddha said:
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a12_2']	染者著染法故，行自損害、行他損害、行俱損害。	染者著染法故，行自損害、行他損害、行俱損害。	The defiled one is attached to defiled dharmas, thus practicing self-harm, practicing harm to others, and practicing harm to both.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a12_18']	如是乃至癡者著於癡法，其義亦然。	如是乃至癡者著於癡法，其義亦然。	In the same way, up to the deluded one being attached to deluded dharmas, the meaning is also so.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a13_3']	論者言：	論者言：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a15_3']	此中非無雜染道理，雖有如幻，謂以無實染等體故，但以行聚所成，世俗言說，非勝義諦。	此中非無雜染道理，雖有如幻，謂以無實染等體故，但以行聚所成，世俗言說，非勝義諦。	Here there is not a lack of the principle of defilement, although there is like an illusion, because there is no real essence of defilement, etc., but it is merely composed of the accumulation of practices, worldly speech, not the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a15_8']	何所以邪？	何所以邪？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a15_20']	此言染法，染者為先有邪？	此言染法，染者為先有邪？	Are these defiled dharmas prior to the defiled one?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a16_4']	為後有邪？	為後有邪？	Or are they subsequent?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a16_14']	為染者染法俱時起邪？	為染者染法俱時起邪？	Or do the defiled one and defiled dharmas arise simultaneously?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a16_19']	三皆不然。	三皆不然。	None of the three is correct.

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a21_7']	此說畢竟應知此義遮其所離，若染法無體，染者亦然。	此說畢竟應知此義遮其所離，若染法無體，染者亦然。	This ultimately refutes the separation. If the defiled dharmas have no substance, the defiled one is also so.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a22_6']	止其所作，非熟無果有果成熟，其義可見。	止其所作，非熟無果有果成熟，其義可見。	It stops what is done. Without ripening, there is no fruit. The ripening of the fruit can be seen.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a23_13']	若離染法有染者成，如是乃應別有染法，此即染者因染法得。	若離染法有染者成，如是乃應別有染法，此即染者因染法得。	If apart from the defiled dharmas there is the establishment of the defiled one, then there should be separate defiled dharmas. This is precisely the defiled one obtaining the defiled dharmas through causes.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a24_7']	若爾云何染者有故染法即成？	若爾云何染者有故染法即成？	If so, how can the defiled dharmas be established because of the existence of the defiled one?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a25_7']	染法有故染者即成，然後起染，此義顯明。	染法有故染者即成，然後起染，此義顯明。	Because the defiled dharmas exist, the defiled one is established. Then the defilement arises. This meaning is clearly manifest.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a26_11']	如果成熟，若有愛境即染法成，若無愛境云何有染？	如果成熟，若有愛境即染法成，若無愛境云何有染？	If it is mature, if there is an object of desire, then defiled dharmas are established. If there is no object of desire, how can there be defilement?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a27_1']	應當止遣安立過失。	應當止遣安立過失。	One should stop and refute the fault of establishment.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a27_14']	此中亦非先有染者後起染法。	此中亦非先有染者後起染法。	Here, it is also not the case that there is a defiled one first and then the arising of defiled dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146a28_4']	故頌遣言：	故頌遣言：	Therefore, the verse refutes:

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b01_16']	所依染法無體性故，如已成熟。	所依染法無體性故，如已成熟。	Because the defiled dharmas that are the basis have no essence, like what is already mature.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b02_1']	復次頌言：	復次頌言：	Next, the verse says:
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b03_14']	「若有若無染，　　染者亦復然。	「若有若無染，　　染者亦復然。	Whether there is defilement or not, the defiled one is also the same.

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b05_11']	若先有染者、後有染法，即一切處如染法體，是故先無染者道理。	若先有染者、後有染法，即一切處如染法體，是故先無染者道理。	If there is a defiled one first and then defiled dharmas, then everywhere it is like the essence of defiled dharmas. Therefore, the principle of a prior defiled one does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b06_11']	令為證成此義，是故頌言：	令為證成此義，是故頌言：	In order to make this meaning clear, therefore the verse says:
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b07_14']	「染者先有染，　　離染者染成。	「染者先有染，　　離染者染成。	The defiled one first has defilement, apart from the defiled one, defilement is established.

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b09_6']	染法若無愛體可作，是中其或見有所成，此非道理。	染法若無愛體可作，是中其或見有所成，此非道理。	If defiled dharmas do not have the essence of craving that can be made, then in this case, if one sees something accomplished, this is not reasonable.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b10_4']	有異宗言：	有異宗言：	There is a different school that says:
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b11_3']	離彼染者別有染法，離彼染法染者可立。	離彼染者別有染法，離彼染法染者可立。	Apart from the defiled one, there are separate defiled dharmas. Apart from those defiled dharmas, the defiled one can be established.

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b12_17']	若離染法得有染者，此中非有。	若離染法得有染者，此中非有。	If apart from defiled dharmas, the defiled one can exist, this is not so in this case.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b13_2']	何所以邪？	何所以邪？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b14_2']	若先有染法、後有染者，即離染者乃有染法。	若先有染法、後有染者，即離染者乃有染法。	If first there are defiled dharmas and later there is the defiled one, then apart from the defiled one, there are defiled dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b15_8']	此中染法不有，即無愛境能成染法道理，以愛境後有故。	此中染法不有，即無愛境能成染法道理，以愛境後有故。	In this case, defiled dharmas do not exist, and there is no principle by which the object of craving can accomplish defiled dharmas, because the object of craving exists later.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b16_15']	由如是故，若離自性別因染者得有染法，即彼染法因染者得。	由如是故，若離自性別因染者得有染法，即彼染法因染者得。	For this reason, if apart from the self-nature of the defiled one, defiled dharmas can exist, then those defiled dharmas are accomplished by the defiled one.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b18_1']	若爾即非愛境能成染法，以愛境居後故，所成不可得。	若爾即非愛境能成染法，以愛境居後故，所成不可得。	In that case, the object of craving cannot accomplish defiled dharmas, because the object of craving exists later, and what is accomplished cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b18_11']	若如此者，豈非過邪？	若如此者，豈非過邪？	If this is so, isn't this a fault?
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b19_2']	亦非先有染法後成染者。	亦非先有染法後成染者。	It is also not the case that first there are defiled dharmas and later the defiled one is accomplished.

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146b29_10']	謂以染法染者二相離性互有所違，若法未生二俱無性，若法已生所作無體，但由愛境所成染法故有染者。	謂以染法染者二相離性互有所違，若法未生二俱無性，若法已生所作無體，但由愛境所成染法故有染者。	It means that the two characteristics of the defiled dharmas and the defiled one are mutually contradictory in terms of their nature of separation. If a dharma has not yet arisen, both are without nature. If a dharma has already arisen, what is to be done is without substance. It is only because of the defiled dharmas that are accomplished due to the objects of desire that there is the defiled one.
['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146c01_6']	而彼愛境及所起染法悉亦止遣。	而彼愛境及所起染法悉亦止遣。	But those objects of desire and the defiled dharmas that arise are all also refuted.

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146c02_2']	彼染法染者為一性可合邪？	彼染法染者為一性可合邪？	Can the defiled dharmas and the defiled one be combined as having the same nature?

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146c07_11']	此中應知，是提婆達多起染，不復為彼提婆達多染者之因。	此中應知，是提婆達多起染，不復為彼提婆達多染者之因。	Herein, one should know that this is Devadatta giving rise to defilement, and it is not again the cause of that Devadatta, the defiled one.

['ZH_T30_1567_005:0146c17_15']	若此一性定有合者，如前所說提婆達多合義應見，是故無一性因可合道理。	若此一性定有合者，如前所說提婆達多合義應見，是故無一性因可合道理。	If this single nature definitely has conjunction, then as explained above, the meaning of conjunction should be seen, therefore there is no single nature cause that can reasonably be conjoined.
