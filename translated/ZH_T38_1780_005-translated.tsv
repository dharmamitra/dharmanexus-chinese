Therefore, it is only clarified that prajñā illuminates the true aspect and skillful means illuminate all dharmas.
['ZH_T38_1780_005:0883c04_15']	舊義般若不能照諸法、漚和不能知實相，雖復並觀，智用恒別，則是格局聖心、封執二見也。	舊義般若不能照諸法、漚和不能知實相，雖復並觀，智用恒別，則是格局聖心、封執二見也。	005	The old interpretation says that prajñā cannot illuminate all dharmas and skillful means cannot know the true aspect. Although they observe together, the function of cognition is always separate. This is like imposing limitations on the holy mind and being confined to two views.

['ZH_T38_1780_005:0883c13_9']	是故經中或言般若不著空、方便不著有，或言般若不著有、方便不證空。	是故經中或言般若不著空、方便不著有，或言般若不著有、方便不證空。	005	Therefore, in the sūtras it is sometimes said that prajñā is not attached to emptiness and skillful means is not attached to existence, or that prajñā is not attached to existence and skillful means does not realize emptiness.

That which can give rise to the real characteristic is unconditioned prajñā, so it does not transform unconditioned prajñā into conditioned prajñā.

Therefore, it is known that both kinds of wisdom are called prajñā, which is the same as combining the provisional and the real and calling them all the real meaning.

Only then does one know the emptiness of the three realms, yet adorn the three realms.' Therefore, it is known that both kinds of wisdom are called skillful means.
['ZH_T38_1780_005:0888a11_14']	對此義，亦得六地有方便與波若，皆名波若。	對此義，亦得六地有方便與波若，皆名波若。	005	In contrast to this meaning, it is also possible that the sixth ground has skillful means and prajñā, both of which are called prajñā.
