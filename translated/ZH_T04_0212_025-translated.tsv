['ZH_T04_0212_025:0741b28_9']	諸惡莫作者，諸佛世尊教誡後人三乘道者，不以脩惡而得至道，皆習於善自致道跡，是故說曰，諸惡莫作也。	諸惡莫作者，諸佛世尊教誡後人三乘道者，不以脩惡而得至道，皆習於善自致道跡，是故說曰，諸惡莫作也。	As for do not do any evil, the World-Honored Buddhas instruct later generations on the path of the Three Vehicles, not to attain the Way through cultivating evil, but to practice goodness and attain the Way on one's own. Therefore, it is said, do not do any evil.
['ZH_T04_0212_025:0741c01_17']	諸善奉行者，彼修行人普脩眾善，唯自瓔珞具足眾德，見惡則避恒脩其善，所謂善者，止觀妙藥燒滅亂想。	諸善奉行者，彼修行人普脩眾善，唯自瓔珞具足眾德，見惡則避恒脩其善，所謂善者，止觀妙藥燒滅亂想。	As for practice all that is good, those who cultivate the Way universally cultivate goodness, adorning themselves with all virtues, avoiding evil and always cultivating goodness. What is called goodness is the wonderful medicine of calming and insight that burns away disordered thoughts.

The knots of the hundred and eight heavy roots are difficult to untie and wrap around the mind. Desire, anger, and ignorance flourish, and arrogance, stinginess, jealousy, and various defilements are produced. Those with this illness have impure minds. Practitioners should uphold their will and refine their minds to prevent disordered thoughts. If they do not cease in this way, they will accomplish the roots of the Way. Therefore, it is said, purify one's own mind.
['ZH_T04_0212_025:0741c09_5']	是諸佛教者，如來演教禁戒不同，戒以檢形義以攝心，佛出世間甚不可遇，猶如優曇鉢花億千萬劫時時乃有；	是諸佛教者，如來演教禁戒不同，戒以檢形義以攝心，佛出世間甚不可遇，猶如優曇鉢花億千萬劫時時乃有；	This is the Buddha's teaching means that the Tathāgata's teachings and precepts are not the same. Precepts are used to restrain the body and righteousness to gather the mind. The Buddha's appearance in the world is extremely difficult to encounter, just like the udumbara flower, which appears only once in many millions of eons.

The prohibitions and admonitions should not be neglected, and giving should not be left undone. The reason I attained Buddhahood and became the king of the three thousand worlds is all due to the precepts and giving.
['ZH_T04_0212_025:0741c12_12']	是故說曰，是諸佛教。	是故說曰，是諸佛教。	Therefore, it is said, this is the Buddha's teaching.
