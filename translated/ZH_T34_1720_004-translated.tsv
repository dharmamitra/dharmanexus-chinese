['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b03_15']	一云空解為正乘，有解為相從。	一云空解為正乘，有解為相從。	One says that the understanding of emptiness is the correct vehicle, while the understanding of existence is secondary.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b04_15']	例如十地空解為能生之本，有解為地上所生。	例如十地空解為能生之本，有解為地上所生。	This is analogous to the understanding of emptiness being the root that gives rise to the ten grounds, while the understanding of existence is what is given rise to on the grounds.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b05_17']	地義如前，若乘取運義，即兩解俱能運。	地義如前，若乘取運義，即兩解俱能運。	The meaning of the grounds is as above. If one takes the meaning of transportation as the vehicle, then both understandings are able to transport.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b08_2']	今所明以中道正觀為乘體也，中道正觀非空非有方能出有無二見，故云空有並是乘方便用也。	今所明以中道正觀為乘體也，中道正觀非空非有方能出有無二見，故云空有並是乘方便用也。	Now, what is clarified is taking the correct contemplation of the middle way as the essence of the vehicle. The correct contemplation of the middle way, which is neither empty nor existent, is only able to transcend the two views of existence and non-existence, therefore it is said that emptiness and existence are both expedient uses of the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b08_7']	地義亦爾。	地義亦爾。	The meaning of the stages is also like this.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b10_4']	有人言三十心是乘正位。	有人言三十心是乘正位。	Some say the thirty minds are the correct stage of the vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b11_6']	有人言八地是乘正位。	有人言八地是乘正位。	Some say the eighth stage is the correct stage of the vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b13_11']	有人言初得方便失正體，第二得正體失方便，第三得竝觀及乘體，失不竝及乘方便，故具有三義。	有人言初得方便失正體，第二得正體失方便，第三得竝觀及乘體，失不竝及乘方便，故具有三義。	Some say the first obtains the expedient means but loses the true essence, the second obtains the true essence but loses the expedient means, the third obtains the simultaneous contemplation and the essence of the vehicle, but loses the non-simultaneous and the expedient means of the vehicle, therefore it has all three meanings.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b14_19']	三十心為方便，登地為正體，八地為竝乘，七地為不竝乘也。	三十心為方便，登地為正體，八地為竝乘，七地為不竝乘也。	The thirty minds are the expedient means, ascending the stages is the true essence, the eighth stage is the simultaneous vehicle, and the seventh stage is the non-simultaneous vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b17_6']	〈問乘品〉云「是乘無始無終，不出三界，亦不住薩婆若。	〈問乘品〉云「是乘無始無終，不出三界，亦不住薩婆若。	The Questions on the Vehicle Chapter says: This vehicle has no beginning and no end, does not leave the three realms, and also does not dwell in sarvajña.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b18_16']	」如經廣明，若欲令乘出者，是人欲令無生法忍出、欲令真諦法出？	」如經廣明，若欲令乘出者，是人欲令無生法忍出、欲令真諦法出？	 As extensively clarified in the sutra, if one wishes to make the vehicle leave, this person wishes to make the acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas leave, and wishes to make the truth of dharmas leave?
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b20_19']	然實際無生、實際不出者，乘亦無出，以乘無出故無始無終、不因不果，如此之乘乃名出耳。	然實際無生、實際不出者，乘亦無出，以乘無出故無始無終、不因不果，如此之乘乃名出耳。	However, the ultimate reality is non-arising, and the ultimate reality does not leave. The vehicle also does not leave. Because the vehicle has no leaving, it has no beginning and no end, is neither cause nor effect. Such a vehicle is then called leaving.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b22_6']	若無能出所出、能運所運，即無有乘，云何釋大乘義耶？	若無能出所出、能運所運，即無有乘，云何釋大乘義耶？	If there is neither one who leaves nor that which is left, neither one who transports nor that which is transported, then there is no vehicle. How does one explain the meaning of the Great Vehicle?
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b22_8']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b24_1']	良由得此正悟，不見能出所出，乃名為出，可謂無所出而出、出而無所出。	良由得此正悟，不見能出所出，乃名為出，可謂無所出而出、出而無所出。	It is precisely because of attaining this correct understanding, not seeing one who leaves nor that which is left, that it is called leaving. It can be said that although there is nothing to leave, it leaves; although it leaves, there is nothing to leave.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b25_5']	若有能出所出、能運所運者，即是有所得，無有出義也。	若有能出所出、能運所運者，即是有所得，無有出義也。	If there is something that can emerge and something that is emerged, something that can transport and something that is transported, then it is something that can be attained, and there is no meaning of emergence.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b25_16']	云何是出無所出耶？	云何是出無所出耶？	What is this emergence without anything that emerges?
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b25_18']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b26_7']	經云「不動法故」。	經云「不動法故」。	The sutra says because of the immovable Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b27_2']	不動法者非乘，是常住，名為不動。	不動法者非乘，是常住，名為不動。	The immovable Dharma is not a vehicle, it is the eternal abode, called immovable.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b28_3']	亦不言真諦空故不動，又非乘不去故不動。	亦不言真諦空故不動，又非乘不去故不動。	It also does not say it is immovable because of the emptiness of true reality, and it is not immovable because the vehicle does not go.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b29_1']	此明乘出宛然而無所出，故名不動也。	此明乘出宛然而無所出，故名不動也。	This clarifies that the vehicle emerges vividly yet without anything that emerges, therefore it is called immovable.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392b29_18']	既無出而出，亦無始而始、無終而終。	既無出而出，亦無始而始、無終而終。	Since there is emergence without anything that emerges, there is also beginning without beginning, and end without end.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c02_5']	無始而始始自初心，無終而終終於十地，此是因門分其始終。	無始而始始自初心，無終而終終於十地，此是因門分其始終。	Without beginning there is beginning, beginning from the initial mind; without end there is end, ending at the tenth ground. This is the cause aspect that distinguishes the beginning and end.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c04_6']	就此始終復開二位，地前三十心此觀未具成名為似乘，登地已上得此觀現前故名真乘。	就此始終復開二位，地前三十心此觀未具成名為似乘，登地已上得此觀現前故名真乘。	Within this beginning and end, there are further two stages. The thirty minds before the grounds are called the semblance vehicle because this contemplation has not yet been fully accomplished. From the grounds onward, attaining the manifestation of this contemplation is called the true vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c05_3']	故論云「地前名順忍，登地名無生忍。	故論云「地前名順忍，登地名無生忍。	Therefore, the treatise says, Before the grounds, it is called the patience of conformity; upon entering the grounds, it is called the patience of non-arising.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c14_6']	登地名聖，故云並也。	登地名聖，故云並也。	only upon ascending to the grounds does one become a sage, so it is said to be both.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c21_13']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c22_6']	七地是功用道滿，故名為並；	七地是功用道滿，故名為並；	The seventh ground is the culmination of the path of effort, so it is called equal;
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c22_19']	六地功用未圓，故未得稱並。	六地功用未圓，故未得稱並。	The sixth ground has not yet perfected effort, so it has not yet attained the title of equal.

Because the seventh ground is endowed with both wisdoms, it is called equal. Although the sixth ground has prajñā, it is not yet endowed with skillful means, so it is not equal.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0392c28_2']	所以然者，七地雖並猶有功用，八地任運成就無復功用，是故八地得並七地非並也。	所以然者，七地雖並猶有功用，八地任運成就無復功用，是故八地得並七地非並也。	The reason for this is that although the seventh ground is equal, it still has effort.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a03_6']	但大乘是同，略明三異：	但大乘是同，略明三異：	But the Mahāyāna is the same, with three differences briefly explained:
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a04_1']	一者《法華》對破三執會歸一乘。	一者《法華》對破三執會歸一乘。	First, the Lotus Sūtra is used to break down three attachments and return to the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a05_9']	若《勝鬘》不對三緣，但為七歲已上學一乘緣，辨出生收入之義。	若《勝鬘》不對三緣，但為七歲已上學一乘緣，辨出生收入之義。	If the Śrīmālā-sūtra does not address the three conditions, it is only for the seven-year-old and above who study the One Vehicle, to explain the meaning of giving birth and returning.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a07_8']	收入者，正法出五乘，五乘歸正法。	收入者，正法出五乘，五乘歸正法。	Returning means that the true Dharma gives birth to the five vehicles, and the five vehicles return to the true Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a08_15']	此之出入舒卷皆是平道，因緣法門無所斥奪，與《法華》異。	此之出入舒卷皆是平道，因緣法門無所斥奪，與《法華》異。	This coming and going, expanding and contracting, are all the level path, the Dharma gate of causes and conditions, without any rejection, different from the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a10_1']	《法華》先斥三病故明一乘，然後始得非三非一、三一具足耳。	《法華》先斥三病故明一乘，然後始得非三非一、三一具足耳。	The Lotus Sūtra first criticizes the three illnesses, therefore clarifying the One Vehicle, and only then can it be neither three nor one, with three and one complete.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a11_6']	二者《法華》但明二乘未究竟、佛乘已圓滿，不廣釋其因緣。	二者《法華》但明二乘未究竟、佛乘已圓滿，不廣釋其因緣。	Second, the Lotus Sutra only clarifies that the two vehicles are not yet ultimate and that the Buddha vehicle is already perfect and complete, without extensively explaining its causes and conditions.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a12_15']	《勝鬘》則開五住地之因，辨二生死之果，釋二乘未圓、佛果已滿。	《勝鬘》則開五住地之因，辨二生死之果，釋二乘未圓、佛果已滿。	The Śrīmālā-sūtra reveals the causes of the five abodes and distinguishes the fruits of the two kinds of birth and death, explaining that the two vehicles are not yet perfect and that the Buddha's fruition is already complete.

['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a16_8']	若一經之中皆具明一切義者，即有一教，唯有一緣，何名多部？	若一經之中皆具明一切義者，即有一教，唯有一緣，何名多部？	If within a single sūtra all meanings are fully explained, then there would be only one teaching and only one cause and condition. How can it be called many divisions?
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a17_9']	三者《勝鬘》具明正法出生五乘，數五乘歸正法。	三者《勝鬘》具明正法出生五乘，數五乘歸正法。	Third, the Śrīmālā-sūtra fully explains the arising of the five vehicles within the true Dharma, and counts the five vehicles returning to the true Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1720_004:0393a19_8']	《法華》但明會三乘歸一乘，開一乘為三乘，不正會人天歸一乘，開一乘為三乘為人天乘。	《法華》但明會三乘歸一乘，開一乘為三乘，不正會人天歸一乘，開一乘為三乘為人天乘。	The Lotus Sutra only clarifies the merging of the three vehicles into one vehicle, and the revealing of the one vehicle as the three vehicles. It does not correctly merge the human and heavenly into the one vehicle, and reveal the one vehicle as the three vehicles and the human and heavenly vehicles.

Practitioners of the two vehicles who wish to enter the bodhisattva Dharma must first understand that the three vehicles are provisional and the One Vehicle is true, in order to break through their ignorance of the provisional and true.

Having changed from believing in the three to believing in the One, one must study the bodhisattva's two wisdoms of emptiness and existence. Contemplating emptiness without realizing it, one leaves the stage of the two vehicles, and engaging with existence without attachment, one leaves the realm of ordinary beings. Therefore, one is born in the Buddha's family with a noble lineage.

Therefore, internal stillness is taken as the real, and external dynamic activity is taken as the expedient. Therefore, there is the third dynamic and still two wisdoms.

Therefore, it is said that emptiness and existence are both extremes and are all conventional truths. The dharma of the middle way, which is neither empty nor existent, is the ultimate truth.

Therefore, the third clarifies the avoidance of the two extremes and non-attachment to the middle way, which is the ultimate truth. The two extremes and the middle way are all conventional truths.
