However, these phenomena go against suchness and are said to obscure the truth, causing phenomena to appear while the truth is not manifest.

It means that phenomena of dependent origination are necessarily without self-nature. Because of being without self-nature, the entire substance is identical to suchness. Therefore, it is said that sentient beings are identical to thusness, not needing to cease. The Vimalakīrti Sūtra says:

Just as a single subtle dust mote does not have a large appearance but is able to contain and encompass the boundless Dharma realm. Since the lands and other phenomena are not apart from the Dharma realm, therefore they all appear within a single dust mote. This points to a single example.
