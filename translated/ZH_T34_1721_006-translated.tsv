['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c09_6']	就文為三：	就文為三：	006	The text is divided into three parts:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c09_11']	一、索車；	一、索車；	006	First, asking for the carts;

['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c10_8']	索車者，大乘機發也。	索車者，大乘機發也。	006	Asking for the carts means the arising of the Mahayana potential.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c10_18']	賜車者，為說一乘也。	賜車者，為說一乘也。	006	Bestowing the carts means expounding the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c11_10']	得車歡喜者，聞一乘悟解也。	得車歡喜者，聞一乘悟解也。	006	Rejoicing in obtaining the carts means understanding the One Vehicle upon hearing it.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c12_13']	義唯有此三，不得多少，譬上〈方便品〉說一乘也。	義唯有此三，不得多少，譬上〈方便品〉說一乘也。	006	The meaning is only these three, not more or less, and it illustrates the explanation of the One Vehicle in the chapter on skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c13_6']	索車是一經大宗，今略釋之。	索車是一經大宗，今略釋之。	006	Asking for the carts is the great theme of this sutra, and I will now briefly explain it.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c13_10']	有人言：	有人言：	006	Some say:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c15_12']	昔得羅漢後出遊觀心，以天眼照見未來猶有生死，則煩惱未盡未有盡智，猶有生死無無生智。	昔得羅漢後出遊觀心，以天眼照見未來猶有生死，則煩惱未盡未有盡智，猶有生死無無生智。	006	After attaining arhatship in the past, when going out to observe, using the heavenly eye to illuminate and see that there is still birth and death in the future, then afflictions have not yet been exhausted, there is no knowledge of exhaustion, there is still birth and death, and there is no knowledge of non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c16_7']	佛何故說羅漢有盡、無生智耶？	佛何故說羅漢有盡、無生智耶？	006	Why did the Buddha say that arhats have the knowledge of exhaustion and non-arising?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c17_13']	以就佛索覓盡、無生智故言索車，車者即是盡、無生智也。	以就佛索覓盡、無生智故言索車，車者即是盡、無生智也。	006	Because they sought the knowledge of extinction and non-arising from the Buddha, it is said they sought the carriage. The carriage is precisely the knowledge of extinction and non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c19_13']	今謂不然，昔既見有生死未盡，即知三乘非是究竟，亦應即知一乘是究竟，云何復有索也。	今謂不然，昔既見有生死未盡，即知三乘非是究竟，亦應即知一乘是究竟，云何復有索也。	006	Now, this is not so. Since they already saw that birth and death were not yet extinguished, they should have known that the three vehicles are not ultimate, and they should have also known that the one vehicle is ultimate. How could there still be seeking?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c20_14']	又三藏教內明羅漢，云何已得知三界外事也？	又三藏教內明羅漢，云何已得知三界外事也？	006	Moreover, in the Tripiṭaka Teaching, it is explained that arhats, how could they already know about matters outside the three realms?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c21_14']	若小乘已明三界外事，與大乘復有何異耶？	若小乘已明三界外事，與大乘復有何異耶？	006	If the Hīnayāna already explains matters outside the three realms, then what difference is there with the Mahāyāna?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c22_14']	今所明者索車之譬但就今辨，非昔教存也。	今所明者索車之譬但就今辨，非昔教存也。	006	What is explained now is that the analogy of seeking the carriage is only about the present, not about the teaching of the past.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c23_4']	但索車譬凡有二門：	但索車譬凡有二門：	006	But there are generally two approaches to the analogy of seeking the carriage:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c24_3']	一者、無索假設索譬，二、約疑情明有索也。	一者、無索假設索譬，二、約疑情明有索也。	006	First, the analogy of seeking without seeking; second, clarifying that there is seeking based on doubts.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c24_18']	言無索而假設索譬者，凡有二義：	言無索而假設索譬者，凡有二義：	006	As for the analogy of seeking without seeking, there are generally two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0526c25_19']	一者、欲顯三乘是方便，二、欲顯一乘是真實。	一者、欲顯三乘是方便，二、欲顯一乘是真實。	006	First, wanting to reveal that the three vehicles are expedient; second, wanting to reveal that the one vehicle is true.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a03_1']	顯三乘是方便明道理無三，顯一乘是真實亦道理有一，蓋是一經大宗，故假設索車譬也。	顯三乘是方便明道理無三，顯一乘是真實亦道理有一，蓋是一經大宗，故假設索車譬也。	006	It shows that the three vehicles are expedient and that in principle there are not three, and it shows that the one vehicle is true and that in principle there is one. This is the great purport of the sutra, and therefore it uses the parable of asking for the carts.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a04_10']	欲顯三乘是方便者，前明長者辨無有三乘，虛指門外無三說三；	欲顯三乘是方便者，前明長者辨無有三乘，虛指門外無三說三；	006	If one wishes to show that the three vehicles are expedient, previously it was explained that the elder does not have three vehicles, and he falsely points to outside the gate, saying there are three when there are not three.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a05_2']	此就父明三乘是方便也。	此就父明三乘是方便也。	006	Here, from the perspective of the father, it is explained that the three vehicles are expedient.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a06_5']	門外若實有三車，子出門外便見有三則不索三也。	門外若實有三車，子出門外便見有三則不索三也。	006	If there were truly three carts outside the gate, then when the child went outside the gate he would see there are three and would not ask for three.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a08_7']	以其索三故知門外無有三車，驗父前言理實無三方便說三，此寄子索三以顯三是方便也。	以其索三故知門外無有三車，驗父前言理實無三方便說三，此寄子索三以顯三是方便也。	006	Since he asks for three, one knows that outside the gate there are not three carts. Examining the father's previous statement that in reality there are not three but he expediently speaks of three, this uses the child's asking for three to show that the three are expedient.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a08_9']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a09_4']	何故寄父子並顯三乘是方便耶？	何故寄父子並顯三乘是方便耶？	006	Why does it use the father and son together to show that the three vehicles are expedient?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a09_6']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a11_17']	此教所興正為破執三乘是實，故宜明三乘是方便，即是開方便門，然後始得顯真實義，故寄父子明三乘是方便也。	此教所興正為破執三乘是實，故宜明三乘是方便，即是開方便門，然後始得顯真實義，故寄父子明三乘是方便也。	006	This teaching is precisely for refuting the attachment to the three vehicles as real, therefore it is appropriate to clarify that the three vehicles are expedient means, which is then opening the door of expedient means. Only then can the true meaning be revealed, therefore the three vehicles are expedient means are illustrated through the relationship between father and son.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a14_14']	所言寄索車譬顯一乘是真實者，下明等賜即是有一，將明一有宜辨三無，三無不彰則一有不顯，故寄索三以顯無三；	所言寄索車譬顯一乘是真實者，下明等賜即是有一，將明一有宜辨三無，三無不彰則一有不顯，故寄索三以顯無三；	006	As for the statement that the parable of requesting the carriage illustrates that the One Vehicle is the truth, the explanation below that the equal bestowal is precisely the existence of the One, which is about to clarify the non-existence of the three. If the non-existence of the three is not manifested, then the existence of the One is not revealed, therefore the request for the three is used to illustrate the non-existence of the three.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a16_11']	如其有三則不索三，以其索三故知無三，在三既無一有便顯，故方得賜一也。	如其有三則不索三，以其索三故知無三，在三既無一有便顯，故方得賜一也。	006	If there were the three, then there would be no request for the three. Since there is the request for the three, it is known that the three do not exist. Since the three do not exist, the existence of the One is then revealed, therefore it is only then possible to bestow the One.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a17_5']	蓋是經之正意，不須異釋也。	蓋是經之正意，不須異釋也。	006	This is precisely the main purport of the sūtra, there is no need for different interpretations.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a19_5']	所言就疑情明有索者，然迷悟二門俱無有索，昔既執三則見有車，證得小果便不索車；	所言就疑情明有索者，然迷悟二門俱無有索，昔既執三則見有車，證得小果便不索車；	006	As for the statement that existence is clarified based on the state of doubt, both the deluded and enlightened gates are devoid of request. In the past, since the three were clung to, then the carriage was seen to exist. Upon attaining the small fruit, the carriage was not requested;
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a20_17']	今若領悟知有一無三亦不索三，而今言有索者，約彼疑情言有索耳。	今若領悟知有一無三亦不索三，而今言有索者，約彼疑情言有索耳。	006	Now, if one understands that there is one and not three, one would not seek three. But now it is said that there is seeking, it is only about their doubtful feelings that it is said there is seeking.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a22_8']	佛昔說有三，今教明無三，惑者將今無三徵覓昔有三，故言索耳。	佛昔說有三，今教明無三，惑者將今無三徵覓昔有三，故言索耳。	006	The Buddha formerly spoke of there being three, but now the teaching clarifies there is not three. Deluded people use the present non-three to investigate and seek the former three, thus it is said there is seeking.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a22_10']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a23_1']	為三人索三，為二人索三？	為三人索三，為二人索三？	006	Do the three people seek three, or do two people seek three?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a23_3']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a24_3']	據出門而索三者，但是羅漢辟支二人索三耳。	據出門而索三者，但是羅漢辟支二人索三耳。	006	As for seeking three upon leaving the gate, it is only the two people of arhats and pratyekabuddhas seeking three.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a26_3']	小乘明菩薩從初發心乃至補處，未斷煩惱猶是凡夫，故在門內不得言出門外索車；	小乘明菩薩從初發心乃至補處，未斷煩惱猶是凡夫，故在門內不得言出門外索車；	006	The Lesser Vehicle clarifies that from the initial arousal of the mind up to the position of substitute, bodhisattvas have not yet severed afflictions and are still ordinary beings, thus they are within the gate and cannot be said to be outside the gate seeking vehicles;
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a27_4']	大乘菩薩出三界外，自知未至佛果亦不索車。	大乘菩薩出三界外，自知未至佛果亦不索車。	006	Mahayana bodhisattvas are outside the three realms and themselves know they have not yet attained the fruition of Buddhahood and also do not seek vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a28_10']	又三車譬三乘果，羅漢辟支至二果處覓果不得故索果也；	又三車譬三乘果，羅漢辟支至二果處覓果不得故索果也；	006	Moreover, the three vehicles are likened to the fruition of the three vehicles. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas, having reached the stage of the two fruitions, do not obtain the fruition and thus seek the fruition.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a29_16']	無有菩薩至佛果處覓佛果不得，故無菩薩索佛果車也。	無有菩薩至佛果處覓佛果不得，故無菩薩索佛果車也。	006	There are no bodhisattvas who have attained Buddhahood who can find Buddhahood, therefore there are no bodhisattvas seeking the vehicle of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527a29_18']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b01_17']	若爾，但二人索，但應索二，何得索三耶？	若爾，但二人索，但應索二，何得索三耶？	006	If that is so, only two people are seeking, so they should only seek two, how can they seek three?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b01_19']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b02_11']	一人二人俱得索三，無所疑也。	一人二人俱得索三，無所疑也。	006	One person and two people can both seek three, there is no doubt.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b02_13']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b03_10']	若爾，言二人索者，何得文云諸子索耶？	若爾，言二人索者，何得文云諸子索耶？	006	If that is so, if it is said that two people are seeking, how can the text say that the children are seeking?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b03_12']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b04_12']	蓋是總相稱為諸子，非是門外三人名為諸子。	蓋是總相稱為諸子，非是門外三人名為諸子。	006	It is a general term for the children, it is not the three people outside the gate who are called the children.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b05_1']	故後合譬釋云：	故後合譬釋云：	006	Therefore, the later combined parable explains:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b07_12']	若見無量億千眾生出三界苦得涅槃樂，此但明二乘人出三界得涅槃樂，不說菩薩，則知不必皆是三子索也。	若見無量億千眾生出三界苦得涅槃樂，此但明二乘人出三界得涅槃樂，不說菩薩，則知不必皆是三子索也。	006	If one sees immeasurable billions of sentient beings leaving the suffering of the three realms and attaining the bliss of nirvana, this only clarifies that the two vehicles leave the three realms and attain the bliss of nirvana, it does not speak of bodhisattvas, then one should know that it is not necessarily all three children seeking.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b07_14']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b08_4']	頗有菩薩亦有索車不？	頗有菩薩亦有索車不？	006	Are there any bodhisattvas who also seek the vehicle?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b08_6']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b10_6']	若據門外無菩薩索，若通論門內約疑情者，昔說有三今說無三，菩薩以無徵有亦有索也。	若據門外無菩薩索，若通論門內約疑情者，昔說有三今說無三，菩薩以無徵有亦有索也。	006	If we discuss it from outside the gate, there are no bodhisattvas seeking; if we discuss it comprehensively, from the perspective of doubts within the gate, the past teaching of three is now said to be non-three. The bodhisattvas use non-existence to verify existence, and there is also seeking.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b10_8']	問：	問：	006	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b10_18']	既其索三，云何賜一？	既其索三，云何賜一？	006	Since they seek three, why is only one given?
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b10_20']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b12_18']	既以疑情故索，疑是解津，若有解津則大機已動，扣佛說一，即是索一，故後賜一也。	既以疑情故索，疑是解津，若有解津則大機已動，扣佛說一，即是索一，故後賜一也。	006	Since they seek due to doubtful feelings, doubt is the ferry to understanding. If there is a ferry to understanding, then the great capacity has already moved. Knocking on the Buddha to speak one is precisely seeking one, so later one is given.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b13_16']	「爾時長者各賜諸子」，此第二、明賜車也。	「爾時長者各賜諸子」，此第二、明賜車也。	006	At that time, the elder each gave the children... This is the second, clarifying the bestowal of the carts.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b14_9']	索所不與者，無三可赴索也。	索所不與者，無三可赴索也。	006	What is sought but not given is that there are no three to fulfill the seeking.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b15_2']	與所不索者，有一以賜機也。	與所不索者，有一以賜機也。	006	What is given but not sought is that there is one to bestow according to capacity.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b15_7']	就文為二：	就文為二：	006	In the text, there are two parts:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b15_18']	初、標等賜大車二章門；	初、標等賜大車二章門；	006	First, it presents the two chapters of bestowing the great carts equally;
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b16_4']	次、釋二章門。	次、釋二章門。	006	Second, it explains the two chapters.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b16_10']	標二章門者：	標二章門者：	006	Presenting the two chapters means:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b17_4']	一、標等賜章門，二、標大車章門。	一、標等賜章門，二、標大車章門。	006	First, presenting the chapter on bestowing equally; second, presenting the chapter on the great carts.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b17_17']	所與之人非一，故云各賜也。	所與之人非一，故云各賜也。	006	The people who receive it are not one, so it is said to be given to each.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b19_3']	等一者，昔三機偏發，以大車賜菩薩不賜二乘，故若偏賜；	等一者，昔三機偏發，以大車賜菩薩不賜二乘，故若偏賜；	006	Equally means that in the past, the three capacities were biased, so the great vehicle was given to bodhisattvas but not to the two vehicles, thus it was biased.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b20_10']	今三病既消、大機並發，等與大車，對昔與偏，故今明等賜。	今三病既消、大機並發，等與大車，對昔與偏，故今明等賜。	006	Now that the three illnesses have been eliminated and the great capacity has been fully activated, the great vehicle is given equally. In contrast to the biased giving of the past, the present clarifies the equal giving.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b22_1']	故下文云「不令有人獨得滅度，皆以如來滅度而滅度之」，即其證也。	故下文云「不令有人獨得滅度，皆以如來滅度而滅度之」，即其證也。	006	Therefore, the text below says, Not allowing anyone to attain extinction alone, all are brought to extinction through the Tathagata's extinction, which is the proof.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b23_3']	「不令有人獨得滅度」者，不令菩薩獨得大涅槃也。	「不令有人獨得滅度」者，不令菩薩獨得大涅槃也。	006	Not allowing anyone to attain extinction alone means not allowing bodhisattvas alone to attain great nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b24_5']	「皆以如來滅度而滅度」者，亦令二乘證大涅槃也。	「皆以如來滅度而滅度」者，亦令二乘證大涅槃也。	006	All are brought to extinction through the Tathagata's extinction means also allowing the two vehicles to realize great nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0527b24_20']	「大車」下，第二，標大車章門。	「大車」下，第二，標大車章門。	006	Great vehicle is the second, the chapter on the great vehicle.

This chapter still illustrates the above meaning, so it first clarifies strange birds and poisonous insects to illustrate love, and yakṣas and evil ghosts illustrate views.

['ZH_T34_1721_006:0533c16_11']	答：	答：	006	The answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0533c18_12']	然諸法本性寂滅，未曾生死之與涅槃，亦未曾有眾生及與諸佛，但於顛倒妄情故有眾生。	然諸法本性寂滅，未曾生死之與涅槃，亦未曾有眾生及與諸佛，但於顛倒妄情故有眾生。	006	However, the fundamental nature of all phenomena is quiescent extinction, never having had birth and death or nirvana, and never having had sentient beings or buddhas.

The meaning of dwelling in them is like the form of a house. The number of people dwelling in the three realms is the five paths, named the five hundred people. These five hundred people give rise to the afflictions of the three poisons, called poisonous insects. If they give rise to various views, they are called evil ghosts. Endowed with this love and views, they then experience the suffering fruits that burn and torment body and mind, thus called the calamity of fire. Therefore, within the three realms, there are these five things.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0534a10_10']	次明則約此眾生具足五義名出三界人，一者則此眾生值佛菩薩聞說三乘教種三乘種子名三十子，漸次修行成三乘聖人故名羅漢辟支及以菩薩，即此三乘人若聞《法華》同悟一乘並名菩薩，即此菩薩修行滿足故名為佛。	次明則約此眾生具足五義名出三界人，一者則此眾生值佛菩薩聞說三乘教種三乘種子名三十子，漸次修行成三乘聖人故名羅漢辟支及以菩薩，即此三乘人若聞《法華》同悟一乘並名菩薩，即此菩薩修行滿足故名為佛。	006	Next, clarifying that these sentient beings are fully endowed with the five meanings and are called people who have left the three realms. First, these sentient beings encounter the Buddha and bodhisattvas, hear the teachings of the three vehicles, and plant the seeds of the three vehicles, named the thirty children. Gradually practicing and accomplishing the sages of the three vehicles, thus called arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. These people of the three vehicles, if they hear the Lotus Sutra, equally awaken to the one vehicle and are all called bodhisattvas. These bodhisattvas, in their practice, reach fulfillment and are thus called buddhas.

Therefore, neither birth and death nor nirvana is the intrinsically quiescent nature, which is said to be the depletion of both rivers, as the Huayan Sutra says, Birth and death are not chaotic, and nirvana is not quiescent.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0534a16_13']	然非生死非涅槃故能示生死涅槃二種方便，謂二河俱滿也。	然非生死非涅槃故能示生死涅槃二種方便，謂二河俱滿也。	006	However, because it is neither birth and death nor nirvana, it is able to manifest the two expedient means of birth and death and nirvana, which is said to be the fullness of both rivers.

['ZH_T34_1721_006:0534a23_9']	四者、菩薩之人知厭知出名為直出，故乘是寶車直至道場。	四者、菩薩之人知厭知出名為直出，故乘是寶車直至道場。	006	Fourth, bodhisattvas know of disgust and know of leaving, which is called direct leaving, so they ride this jeweled carriage straight to the site of enlightenment.

It is an analogy for sentient beings giving rise to pride, looking down on others and elevating themselves. Pride is not the beginning of the three poisons, nor is it the head of the five dull afflictions. It only shows that the arising of pride has no fixed characteristics, so pride is explained first.

However, these birds either make strange sounds or emit harmonious tones. Strange sounds are likened to harsh speech and divisive speech, while harmonious tones are likened to false speech and frivolous speech.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0534b14_3']	今謂理實難明，但斯一宅內上有怪鳥下有毒虫，以此為譬者，上在怪鳥譬上二界愛使也。	今謂理實難明，但斯一宅內上有怪鳥下有毒虫，以此為譬者，上在怪鳥譬上二界愛使也。	006	I now say that the principle is truly difficult to understand.

The form realm also does not avoid suffering, so they seek to be born in the formless realm. The formless realm also does not avoid suffering, and then there is no place to escape suffering, like wandering about in confusion.

The previous prose section says the elder sees the great fire, but it does not clarify the location of the seeing. Therefore, it now explains the texts of the two places, clarifying that the Buddha resides in the ground of the Dharma body, so he sees, just as the elder stands outside the gate and hears.

The main text refers to seeing while now it says hearing. Above, it is based on the sage's wisdom, illuminating and penetrating clearly, likened to seeing with the eyes;

['ZH_T34_1721_006:0540c01_16']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0540c02_10']	作無作約行分別，量無量當法分別。	作無作約行分別，量無量當法分別。	006	Creation and non-creation are distinguished based on practice, while limited and unlimited are distinguished based on the Dharma itself.

['ZH_T34_1721_006:0540c05_10']	量無量者有三種義：	量無量者有三種義：	006	As for limited and unlimited, there are three meanings:

['ZH_T34_1721_006:0540c08_20']	二、淺深明量無量，淺名有量，深名無量，如《毘曇》明苦是性有，《成實》明苦是虛假，拆假故空，此二淺故名有量。	二、淺深明量無量，淺名有量，深名無量，如《毘曇》明苦是性有，《成實》明苦是虛假，拆假故空，此二淺故名有量。	006	Second, shallow and deep clarify the immeasurable. Shallow is called measurable, deep is called immeasurable. As the Abhidharma explains, suffering is a nature that exists. The Satyasiddhi Śāstra explains that suffering is a false imputation. Because it is dismantled, it is empty. These two are shallow, so they are called measurable.
['ZH_T34_1721_006:0540c10_6']	大乘明苦是夢幻本來寂滅則是佛性，此義甚深故名無量。	大乘明苦是夢幻本來寂滅則是佛性，此義甚深故名無量。	006	The Mahāyāna explains that suffering is a dream illusion that is originally quiescent extinction, which is buddha-nature. This meaning is very profound, so it is called immeasurable.

['ZH_T34_1721_006:0540c13_8']	故《涅槃經》言「分別是苦有無量相，非諸聲聞緣覺所知，我於彼經竟不說之」也。	故《涅槃經》言「分別是苦有無量相，非諸聲聞緣覺所知，我於彼經竟不說之」也。	006	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, The analysis of the characteristics of suffering is immeasurable, not known by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. I did not explain it in that sūtra.
