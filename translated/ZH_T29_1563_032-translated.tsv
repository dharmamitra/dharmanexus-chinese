This concentration is firm and sharp, like a vajra, because it is able to destroy all the proclivities. It is not that it destroys all of them, but it does have the ability to destroy all of them.

The knowledge of elimination produced by the diamond-like samādhi, which is the last uninterrupted path in the elimination of passions, is the last path of liberation in the elimination of passions, and therefore it is said that the knowledge produced by this samādhi arises together with the acquisition of the elimination of the ninth category of passions.
