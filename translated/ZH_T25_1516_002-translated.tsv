['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b11_4']	西天譯經三藏朝散大夫試鴻臚卿傳梵大師賜紫沙門臣法護等奉　詔譯此中應問：	西天譯經三藏朝散大夫試鴻臚卿傳梵大師賜紫沙門臣法護等奉　詔譯此中應問：	002	Tripiṭaka Master from the Western Regions, Chao-san Ta-fu Shih-hung-lu Qing, Tripiṭaka Dharma Master, Bestowed with the Purple Kāṣāya, Śramaṇa Subject Dharmarakṣa and others respectfully translate by imperial decree. Here, one should ask:
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b11_14']	彼勝義諦中云何自性？	彼勝義諦中云何自性？	002	How is the intrinsic nature in that ultimate truth?
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b11_16']	答：	答：	002	The answer:
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b12_7']	頌自喻言「與陽焰等」。	頌自喻言「與陽焰等」。	002	The verse itself says like a mirage.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b14_16']	其「陽焰」者，謂地塵日光三事假合，如陽焰聚，前見後壞，是故頌言「見即壞無相」。	其「陽焰」者，謂地塵日光三事假合，如陽焰聚，前見後壞，是故頌言「見即壞無相」。	002	As for the mirage, it refers to the three things of earth dust, sunlight, and their combination, like a mirage gathering, seen before and destroyed later. Therefore, the verse says seen, then destroyed, without characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b16_3']	諸有所得別別境界，其義亦然，雖各表了皆無自性。	諸有所得別別境界，其義亦然，雖各表了皆無自性。	002	The meaning of all the different objects obtained is also like this. Although each manifests and understands, they all have no intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b16_7']	何以故？	何以故？	002	Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b17_4']	彼等自性前後不和合故，性不相等故。	彼等自性前後不和合故，性不相等故。	002	Because their intrinsic natures do not combine before and after, and their natures are not the same.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b18_7']	愚者取著，於一性轉，是故此等皆墮世俗有情趣故。	愚者取著，於一性轉，是故此等皆墮世俗有情趣故。	002	The foolish take attachment and revolve around a single nature. Therefore, these all fall into the realm of worldly sentient beings.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b20_14']	復次此中若能取、所取對礙性空，即自性明亮本來不生，心法發現猶如影像。	復次此中若能取、所取對礙性空，即自性明亮本來不生，心法發現猶如影像。	002	Furthermore, in this context, if the nature of the obstruction of the grasper and the grasped is empty, then the intrinsic nature is clear and bright, originally unborn, and the mind and mental factors manifest like reflections.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b22_4']	為釋此義故，第七頌言：	為釋此義故，第七頌言：	002	In order to explain this meaning, the seventh verse says:
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b23_0']	「所取如影像，　　無始從心生，	「所取如影像，　　無始從心生，	002	The grasped is like a reflection, arising from the mind since beginningless time.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b24_13']	即彼相及識，　　互相如影像。	即彼相及識，　　互相如影像。	002	Those characteristics and consciousnesses mutually resemble reflections.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b25_19']	」此言「所取如影像」者，謂此與彼而相似故。	」此言「所取如影像」者，謂此與彼而相似故。	002	The phrase the grasped is like a reflection means that this [grasped] is similar to that [reflection].
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b26_3']	所似云何？	所似云何？	002	What does it resemble?
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b26_12']	如鏡等中見面等像。	如鏡等中見面等像。	002	It is like seeing one's own face and so forth in a mirror and so on.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b26_17']	此復云何？	此復云何？	002	What is this again?
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b28_9']	謂從心生，以彼唯心有所生故，心即繫屬有其所取外境相等不捨為性。	謂從心生，以彼唯心有所生故，心即繫屬有其所取外境相等不捨為性。	002	It means arising from the mind, because only the mind has what arises. The mind is then bound to the nature of not abandoning the characteristics of the external objects that are grasped and so forth.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899b28_14']	此義終竟。	此義終竟。	002	This meaning is finally complete.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c02_1']	復次如外所取鏡中面像，即彼諸法以慣習種子領納於心，於無二中取其有二對礙之相。	復次如外所取鏡中面像，即彼諸法以慣習種子領納於心，於無二中取其有二對礙之相。	002	Furthermore, just as the face and so on in a mirror are grasped externally, those dharmas take on the habitual seeds in the mind, and in the non-dual they grasp the characteristics of the two obstructions.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c04_16']	由無始來從心所生如彼影像，或同時異時所緣伺察，彼皆無性非唯心法，亦由所緣之相而能引生能緣識心，是故有相。	由無始來從心所生如彼影像，或同時異時所緣伺察，彼皆無性非唯心法，亦由所緣之相而能引生能緣識心，是故有相。	002	Since beginningless time, they arise from the mind like images, either simultaneously or not, and when examined, they are all without nature, not only mental factors. Also, because of the characteristics of the objects, they are able to give rise to the perceiving mind. Therefore, there are characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c05_9']	凡言相者，攝集為義。	凡言相者，攝集為義。	002	As for what is called characteristics, it means to gather and collect.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c06_8']	非唯一法由彼所取如是有相，能取亦然。	非唯一法由彼所取如是有相，能取亦然。	002	It is not that there is only one dharma. As there are such characteristics to be grasped, so it is with the grasper.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c07_2']	此中意者，所取無性、能取不實。	此中意者，所取無性、能取不實。	002	The meaning here is that what is grasped is without nature, and the grasper is not real.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c07_9']	頌言「互相」。	頌言「互相」。	002	The verse says mutually.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c08_4']	「互相」者，即和合義，互相和合皆如影像。	「互相」者，即和合義，互相和合皆如影像。	002	Mutually means the meaning of combining, mutually combining like images.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c10_7']	如影像故，能取、所取彼二互相不相離性，即彼二法於無所得中互相從彼心法出現有所得相。	如影像故，能取、所取彼二互相不相離性，即彼二法於無所得中互相從彼心法出現有所得相。	002	Because they are like images, the grasper and the grasped are both mutually inseparable. Those two dharmas, within the absence of attainment, mutually arise from that mind and mental factors, appearing as the characteristics of attainment.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c13_3']	此總意者，彼心自性本來明亮，無能取、所取二種之相，本離貪等無明垢染，清淨潔白離諸取著。	此總意者，彼心自性本來明亮，無能取、所取二種之相，本離貪等無明垢染，清淨潔白離諸取著。	002	The general meaning of this is that the nature of that mind is originally bright and clear, without the two aspects of subject and object, and is originally free from the defilements of greed and so forth, pure and clean, free from all attachments.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c13_14']	故下頌云「如水中月」。	故下頌云「如水中月」。	002	Therefore, the verse below says, Like the moon in the water.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c14_4']	為釋此義故，第八頌言：	為釋此義故，第八頌言：	002	In order to explain this meaning, the eighth verse says:
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c15_0']	「觀自淨種中，　　若智月出現，	「觀自淨種中，　　若智月出現，	002	Contemplating in one's own pure seeds, if the moon of wisdom appears,
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c16_13']	彼如水中月，　　現前無所有。	彼如水中月，　　現前無所有。	002	It is like the moon in the water, present but non-existent.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c17_14']	」「觀」者定義，定謂心一境性相。	」「觀」者定義，定謂心一境性相。	002	Contemplation defines concentration, which refers to the characteristic of the mind being one-pointed.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c18_7']	於彼定中有所觀想，心自在故。	於彼定中有所觀想，心自在故。	002	In that concentration, there is something contemplated, because the mind is free.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c19_1']	頌言「自」者，謂自種子淨即清淨。	頌言「自」者，謂自種子淨即清淨。	002	The verse says one's own means one's own pure seeds, which are pure.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c19_10']	清淨者，離濁之義。	清淨者，離濁之義。	002	Pure means free from turbidity.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c20_7']	從自身語心種子所成，等無間緣出生想。	從自身語心種子所成，等無間緣出生想。	002	It is produced from the seeds of one's own body, speech, and mind, and arises from the immediately antecedent condition of imagination.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c23_10']	􄮦紇哩字變成普遍熾焰光明，於是光中從心種子出甘露光廣大照耀，其光復成極大火輪，乘彼火輪出慧方便。	􄮦紇哩字變成普遍熾焰光明，於是光中從心種子出甘露光廣大照耀，其光復成極大火輪，乘彼火輪出慧方便。	002	The letter Hrih transforms into a blazing light that pervades everywhere. Within this light, nectar light emerges from the seed in the heart and shines brilliantly far and wide. The light further forms a very large fire wheel, riding on which the wisdom and skillful means emerge.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c24_4']	復從是生彼􈎻訶字門。	復從是生彼􈎻訶字門。	002	Again, from this arises the letter Kham.

['ZH_T25_1516_002:0899c27_13']	復於相應方位想佛蓮華，彼十六分皆成月輪。	復於相應方位想佛蓮華，彼十六分皆成月輪。	002	Again, in the corresponding directions, visualize the buddhas and lotuses. The sixteen divisions all become moon discs.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a01_2']	如是觀已，復於其上自淨種中想現􈍑吽字具熾盛光，於其光中出現大火熾盛光焰。	如是觀已，復於其上自淨種中想現􈍑吽字具熾盛光，於其光中出現大火熾盛光焰。	002	Having contemplated in this way, further visualize the letter Hrih appearing from one's own pure seed, possessing blazing light. Within that light, a great fire appears with blazing light and flames.

['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a07_14']	其菩薩者，身相青色，八臂三面：	其菩薩者，身相青色，八臂三面：	002	As for that bodhisattva, his body is blue in color, with eight arms and three faces:
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a08_8']	正面青色、右面黃色、左面白色；	正面青色、右面黃色、左面白色；	002	the front face is blue, the right face is yellow, and the left face is white;

['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a16_6']	此菩薩身即如來身，從慧方便之所出生。	此菩薩身即如來身，從慧方便之所出生。	002	This Bodhisattva's body is the Tathāgata's body, born from wisdom and skillful means.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a16_17']	是故頌言「如水中月」。	是故頌言「如水中月」。	002	Therefore, the verse says like the moon in the water.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a17_16']	頌言「若」者，即是如義，如水月故。	頌言「若」者，即是如義，如水月故。	002	The word if means the meaning of thus, because it is like the moon in the water.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a19_11']	此即是空，從是空法之中出生諸法，其所出生即本來不生性，所以喻言如水中月。	此即是空，從是空法之中出生諸法，其所出生即本來不生性，所以喻言如水中月。	002	This is emptiness, and from within this empty dharma, all dharmas are born. What is born is originally unborn by nature, and therefore it is likened to the moon in the water.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a21_3']	此中如是，若於法界自性中取著有性者而實無性。	此中如是，若於法界自性中取著有性者而實無性。	002	Here it is like this. If one grasps at existence within the nature of the dharma realm, it is actually without nature.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a21_7']	何以故？	何以故？	002	Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a21_18']	頌言「現前無所有」故。	頌言「現前無所有」故。	002	The verse says manifesting without anything in front of oneself.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a24_8']	由彼如是於一切法無所得真如中有所作所證而實不能，若有作有證者皆是方便建立諸法，與虛空等。	由彼如是於一切法無所得真如中有所作所證而實不能，若有作有證者皆是方便建立諸法，與虛空等。	002	Because in this way, in the suchness of non-apprehension of all dharmas, there is something to be done and something to be realized, but in reality it cannot be done or realized. If there is something done and something realized, it is all the expedient establishment of dharmas, equal to space.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a25_4']	為證成此義故，第九頌言：	為證成此義故，第九頌言：	002	In order to prove this meaning, the ninth verse says:
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a26_0']	「若相應者智，　　彼即虛空相，	「若相應者智，　　彼即虛空相，	002	If there is correspondence, wisdom is the characteristic of space,
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a27_13']	是故智所知，　　皆如虛空相。	是故智所知，　　皆如虛空相。	002	Therefore, what is known by wisdom is all like the characteristic of space.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a28_19']	」所言「相應」，當知即是智之與定二法相應。	」所言「相應」，當知即是智之與定二法相應。	002	As for what is said to be correspondence, one should know that it is the correspondence of the two dharmas of wisdom and concentration.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900a29_19']	彼之相應即是金剛，有彼相應法，故名相應者。	彼之相應即是金剛，有彼相應法，故名相應者。	002	That correspondence is the vajra, because there is the dharma of correspondence, it is called the one who corresponds.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b02_6']	由彼相應者所有之智，於一切法無所取無二相中，以慧方便生如來身，非如前說蘊處界等戲論自性。	由彼相應者所有之智，於一切法無所取無二相中，以慧方便生如來身，非如前說蘊處界等戲論自性。	002	Because the wisdom of the one who corresponds, in the characteristic of non-apprehension and non-duality of all dharmas, gives rise to the Tathāgata's body through the skillful means of wisdom, not like the previously mentioned self-nature of discursive thought of the aggregates, sense bases, elements, etc.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b02_11']	此義終竟。	此義終竟。	002	This meaning is finally completed.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b03_18']	然如來身，不動法界自性所成，本來不生。	然如來身，不動法界自性所成，本來不生。	002	However, the Tathāgata's body is not moved, and is formed from the nature of the Dharma realm, originally unborn.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b04_2']	何以故？	何以故？	002	Why is this?
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b04_11']	以如來等自性離故。	以如來等自性離故。	002	Because the Tathāgata and so forth are by nature detached.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b05_1']	此即無性，止不可說。	此即無性，止不可說。	002	This is precisely the absence of nature, which cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b06_16']	「無性」者，謂本來不生，故名無性。	「無性」者，謂本來不生，故名無性。	002	Absence of nature means originally unborn, therefore it is called the absence of nature.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b07_4']	是故頌言「如虛空相」。	是故頌言「如虛空相」。	002	Therefore, the verse says like the characteristic of space.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b08_4']	此復云何？	此復云何？	002	What does this mean?
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b10_2']	謂離一切戲論之性故如虛空，以彼虛空如是相故，而虛空相應當如是如理伺察。	謂離一切戲論之性故如虛空，以彼虛空如是相故，而虛空相應當如是如理伺察。	002	It means being detached from the nature of all conceptual proliferation, therefore like space. Because that space has such a characteristic, the characteristic of space should be contemplated in this way according to reason.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b10_11']	「相」者，標表義。	「相」者，標表義。	002	Characteristic means the meaning of indication.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b12_2']	復次當知，於一切法無障礙自性中有所作用者，謂由智入三界心、心所相。	復次當知，於一切法無障礙自性中有所作用者，謂由智入三界心、心所相。	002	Furthermore, it should be known that in the unobstructed nature of all dharmas, there is function, which means that by wisdom one enters the characteristics of the mind and mental factors of the three realms.
['ZH_T25_1516_002:0900b14_4']	「如虛空相」，顯示所知無明隨現有情及器二世間相蘊處界等戲論自性，是即所知為智境界。	「如虛空相」，顯示所知無明隨現有情及器二世間相蘊處界等戲論自性，是即所知為智境界。	002	Like the characteristics of space reveals the characteristics of the two worlds of sentient beings and their environments, which appear according to the ignorance of the knowable. The self-nature of the aggregates, sense bases, and elements is the realm of objects of cognition.
