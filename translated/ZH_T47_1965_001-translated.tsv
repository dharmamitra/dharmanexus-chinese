['ZH_T47_1965_001:0114b14_4']	於此三事決定期願，初是如來斷德正因，次是如來智德正因，第三心者恩德正因，三德合為無上菩提，即是三心，總為無上菩提之因。	於此三事決定期願，初是如來斷德正因，次是如來智德正因，第三心者恩德正因，三德合為無上菩提，即是三心，總為無上菩提之因。	The initial one is the direct cause for the Tathāgata's virtue of cessation, the next one is the direct cause for the Tathāgata's virtue of wisdom, and the third mind is the direct cause for the virtue of kindness. The three virtues combined are the unsurpassed bodhi, which are the three minds, collectively the cause for the unsurpassed bodhi.
['ZH_T47_1965_001:0114b15_3']	因、果雖異，廣長量齊，等無所遺，無不苞故。	因、果雖異，廣長量齊，等無所遺，無不苞故。	Although the cause and effect are different, their vast extent is equal, with nothing left out, because everything is included.

Apart from the bodhi mind, there is nothing that can correspond to this, and therefore this mind is said to be the direct cause for that. This clarifies the aspect of arousing the mind according to phenomena.

['ZH_T47_1965_001:0114b26_11']	依此信解，發廣大心，雖不見有煩惱善法，而不撥無可斷、可修，是故雖願悉斷、修，而不違於無願三昧，雖願皆度無量有情，而不存有能度、所度，故能隨順於空、無相。	依此信解，發廣大心，雖不見有煩惱善法，而不撥無可斷、可修，是故雖願悉斷、修，而不違於無願三昧，雖願皆度無量有情，而不存有能度、所度，故能隨順於空、無相。	Relying on this faith and understanding, one arouses the vast mind. Although one does not see any afflictions or wholesome dharmas, one does not deny that they can be eliminated or cultivated. Therefore, although one vows to completely eliminate and cultivate, one does not contradict the samādhi of non-aspiration. Although one vows to deliver immeasurable sentient beings, one does not cling to the idea of a savior or those to be saved. Therefore, one is able to accord with emptiness and signlessness.

After twenty-one days, those who clearly see and hear refer to those who have not yet attained to see the Tathāgata through the gate of dependent on the consciousness of karma, so after twenty-one days, they enter the ten understandings and see the Buddha arising solely from the mind.
