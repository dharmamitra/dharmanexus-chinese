Therefore, I thought that our ancestor, the Great Master Zhizhe, in his commentary on the Sutra of Contemplation of the Buddha, often adopted the teachings of Jingying, and it should be the same for the Vimalakīrti Sūtra.

It truly does not forget the structure of the original text, and the Jiaxiang of Guanzhong cannot rival it.
['ZH_T38_1776_001:0421a13_18']	吾祖釋義事理兩圓，而以理觀為主、事解稍略，故先讀斯記而後以智者融譚則可乎。	吾祖釋義事理兩圓，而以理觀為主、事解稍略，故先讀斯記而後以智者融譚則可乎。	Our ancestor's explanations of the meaning are both complete in principle and phenomena, but he takes the contemplation of principle as the main focus and the understanding of phenomena is somewhat brief. Therefore, it is appropriate to first read this commentary and then merge it with Zhizhe's teachings.
