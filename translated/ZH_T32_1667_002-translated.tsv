['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b10_10']	奉　制譯對治邪執者，一切邪執莫不皆依我見而起，若離我見則無邪執。	奉　制譯對治邪執者，一切邪執莫不皆依我見而起，若離我見則無邪執。	Respectfully Translated by Imperial Order. The counteraction of false attachments: all false attachments are not based on the view of self, if one is apart from the view of self, then there are no false attachments.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b11_6']	我見有二種，一人我見、二法我見。	我見有二種，一人我見、二法我見。	The view of self has two kinds: first, the view of the self of persons; second, the view of the self of dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b11_20']	人我見者，依諸凡夫說有五種：	人我見者，依諸凡夫說有五種：	As for the view of the self of persons, it is said to have five kinds based on ordinary beings:
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b14_5']	一者如經中說，如來法身究竟寂滅猶如虛空，凡愚聞之不解其義，則執如來性同於虛空常恒遍有。	一者如經中說，如來法身究竟寂滅猶如虛空，凡愚聞之不解其義，則執如來性同於虛空常恒遍有。	First, as it is said in the sūtras, the Dharma body of the Tathāgata is ultimately quiescent and extinct, just like empty space. Foolish people hear this but do not understand the meaning, and then they grasp at the nature of the Tathāgata being the same as empty space, eternally pervading and existent.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b16_3']	為除彼執，明虛空相唯是分別實不可得，有見有對待於諸色，以心分別說名虛空。	為除彼執，明虛空相唯是分別實不可得，有見有對待於諸色，以心分別說名虛空。	In order to eliminate that grasping, it is clarified that the characteristics of empty space are only conceptual and cannot be attained in reality. There is seeing, there is opposition and dependence, with regard to various forms, using the mind to conceptually discriminate and call it empty space.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b17_15']	色既唯是妄心分別，當知虛空亦無有體，一切境相唯是妄心之所分別。	色既唯是妄心分別，當知虛空亦無有體，一切境相唯是妄心之所分別。	Since form is only the discrimination of the deluded mind, you should know that space also has no substance. All objective appearances are only discriminated by the deluded mind.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b18_15']	若離妄心即境界相滅，唯真如心無所不遍。	若離妄心即境界相滅，唯真如心無所不遍。	If one departs from the deluded mind, then the appearances of objects cease, and there is only the mind of suchness, which is all-pervading.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b19_16']	此是如來自性如虛空義，非謂如空是常是有。	此是如來自性如虛空義，非謂如空是常是有。	This is the meaning of the Tathāgata's self-nature being like space, not that suchness is permanent and existent like space.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b21_15']	二者如經中說，一切世法皆畢竟空，乃至涅槃真如法亦畢竟空，本性如是離一切相。	二者如經中說，一切世法皆畢竟空，乃至涅槃真如法亦畢竟空，本性如是離一切相。	Second, as the sūtras say, all worldly dharmas are ultimately empty, and even the nirvāṇa and suchness of the true dharma are ultimately empty, their inherent nature being like this, free from all characteristics.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b22_17']	凡愚聞之不解其義，即執涅槃真如法唯空無物。	凡愚聞之不解其義，即執涅槃真如法唯空無物。	The foolish, upon hearing this, do not understand the meaning and immediately grasp at the suchness of nirvāṇa as being only empty and devoid of substance.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b24_3']	為除彼執，明真如法身自體不空，具足無量性功德故。	為除彼執，明真如法身自體不空，具足無量性功德故。	In order to eliminate that grasping, it is clarified that the essence of the dharma-body of suchness is not empty, because it is replete with immeasurable inherent merits.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b26_4']	三者如經中說，如來藏具足一切諸性功德不增不減。	三者如經中說，如來藏具足一切諸性功德不增不減。	Third, as the sūtras say, the tathāgatagarbha is replete with all inherent merits and virtues, neither increasing nor decreasing.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b27_8']	凡愚聞已不解其義，則執如來藏有色心法自相差別。	凡愚聞已不解其義，則執如來藏有色心法自相差別。	The ignorant, upon hearing this, do not understand the meaning and then grasp at the tathāgatagarbha as having the distinct characteristics of form, mind, and other dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588b28_18']	為除此執，明以真如本無染法差別，立有無邊功德相，非是染相。	為除此執，明以真如本無染法差別，立有無邊功德相，非是染相。	In order to eliminate this grasping, it is clarified that the fundamental nature of suchness is free from the distinctions of defiled dharmas. The establishment of the characteristics of boundless merits is not the characteristics of defilement.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c01_10']	四者如經中說，一切世間諸雜染法，皆依如來藏起，一切法不異真如。	四者如經中說，一切世間諸雜染法，皆依如來藏起，一切法不異真如。	Fourth, as it is said in the sūtras, all the defiled dharmas of the world arise in dependence on the tathāgatagarbha, and all dharmas are not different from suchness.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c02_13']	凡愚聞之不解其義，則謂如來藏具有一切世間染法。	凡愚聞之不解其義，則謂如來藏具有一切世間染法。	The ignorant, upon hearing this, do not understand the meaning and then say that the tathāgatagarbha is endowed with all the defiled dharmas of the world.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c05_15']	為除此執，明如來藏從本具有過恒沙數清淨功德不異真如，過恒沙數煩惱染法唯是妄有本無自性，從無始來未曾暫與如來藏相應。	為除此執，明如來藏從本具有過恒沙數清淨功德不異真如，過恒沙數煩惱染法唯是妄有本無自性，從無始來未曾暫與如來藏相應。	In order to eliminate this grasping, it is clarified that the tathāgatagarbha from the very beginning is endowed with merits that are beyond the sands of the Ganges River and are not different from suchness. The defiled dharmas that are beyond the sands of the Ganges River are only falsely existent and have no intrinsic nature of their own. From beginningless time, they have never been associated with the tathāgatagarbha even for a moment.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c07_1']	若如來藏染法相應而令證會息妄染者，無有是處。	若如來藏染法相應而令證會息妄染者，無有是處。	If the tathāgatagarbha were associated with defiled dharmas and caused one to realize and rest in the cessation of false defilements, there would be no such possibility.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c08_17']	五者如經中說，依如來藏有生死得涅槃。	五者如經中說，依如來藏有生死得涅槃。	Fifth, as the sutra says, based on the Tathāgatagarbha there is birth and death and the attainment of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c10_12']	凡愚聞之不知其義，則謂依如來藏生死有始，以見始故復謂涅槃有其終盡。	凡愚聞之不知其義，則謂依如來藏生死有始，以見始故復謂涅槃有其終盡。	The foolish hear this but do not understand its meaning, and so they say that based on the Tathāgatagarbha birth and death have a beginning. Because they see a beginning, they further say that nirvāṇa has an end.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c11_16']	為除此執，明如來藏無有初際，無明依之生死無始。	為除此執，明如來藏無有初際，無明依之生死無始。	In order to eliminate this attachment, it is clarified that the Tathāgatagarbha has no initial limit, and based on it, birth and death due to ignorance have no beginning.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c13_3']	若言三界外更有眾生始起者，是外道經中說，非是佛教。	若言三界外更有眾生始起者，是外道經中說，非是佛教。	If it is said that outside the three realms there are sentient beings who begin to arise, this is spoken of in the scriptures of non-Buddhists, not in the Buddha's teachings.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c14_11']	以如來藏無有後際，證此永斷生死種子，得於涅槃亦無後際。	以如來藏無有後際，證此永斷生死種子，得於涅槃亦無後際。	Because the Tathāgatagarbha has no final limit, realizing its permanent severance of the seeds of birth and death, attaining nirvāṇa also has no final limit.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c15_10']	依人我見四種見生，是故於此安立彼四。	依人我見四種見生，是故於此安立彼四。	Based on the view of a self-nature, four kinds of views arise. Therefore, they are established here.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c16_19']	法我見者，以二乘鈍根，世尊但為說人無我。	法我見者，以二乘鈍根，世尊但為說人無我。	As for the view of a self-nature of dharmas, because those of the two vehicles have dull faculties, the World-Honored One only taught them the non-self of persons.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c18_3']	彼人便於五蘊生滅畢竟執著，怖畏生死妄取涅槃。	彼人便於五蘊生滅畢竟執著，怖畏生死妄取涅槃。	They then cling to the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates as ultimately real, fear birth and death, and falsely grasp nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c19_13']	為除此執，明五蘊法本性不生，不生故亦無有滅，不滅故本來涅槃。	為除此執，明五蘊法本性不生，不生故亦無有滅，不滅故本來涅槃。	In order to eliminate this attachment, it is clarified that the nature of the five aggregates of existence is originally unborn. Because they are unborn, they also have no cessation. Because they do not cease, they are originally nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c20_16']	若究竟離分別執著，則知一切染法淨法皆相待立。	若究竟離分別執著，則知一切染法淨法皆相待立。	If one is ultimately free from discrimination and attachment, then one will know that all defiled and pure dharmas are established in mutual dependence.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c22_15']	是故當知，一切諸法從本已來，非色非心、非智非識、非無非有，畢竟皆是不可說相。	是故當知，一切諸法從本已來，非色非心、非智非識、非無非有，畢竟皆是不可說相。	Therefore, one should know that all dharmas from the very beginning are neither form nor mind, neither wisdom nor consciousness, neither non-existent nor existent, and are ultimately all of an ineffable nature.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c24_12']	而有言說示教之者，皆是如來善巧方便，假以言語引導眾生，令捨文字入於真實。	而有言說示教之者，皆是如來善巧方便，假以言語引導眾生，令捨文字入於真實。	As for those who speak and teach, they are all the skillful means of the Tathāgata, using language as a provisional means to guide sentient beings, causing them to abandon words and enter into the true reality.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c25_13']	若隨言執義增妄分別，不生實智、不得涅槃。	若隨言執義增妄分別，不生實智、不得涅槃。	If one grasps the meaning according to words, it increases false discrimination, does not give rise to true wisdom, and does not attain nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c27_12']	分別修行正道相者，謂一切如來得道正因，一切菩薩發心修習令現前故。	分別修行正道相者，謂一切如來得道正因，一切菩薩發心修習令現前故。	As for the characteristics of cultivating the correct path, it refers to the true cause of the attainment of the Way by all Tathāgatas, which is cultivated and realized by all Bodhisattvas in order to manifest it.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0588c29_1']	略說發心有三種相，一信成就發心、二解行發心、三證發心。	略說發心有三種相，一信成就發心、二解行發心、三證發心。	In brief, the arising of the resolve is of three kinds: first, the resolve of faith and accomplishment; second, the resolve of understanding and practice; third, the resolve of realization.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a01_4']	信成就發心者，依何位、修何行得信成就堪能發心？	信成就發心者，依何位、修何行得信成就堪能發心？	As for the resolve of faith and accomplishment, on what stage does one rely, and what practices does one cultivate to attain faith and accomplishment and be able to give rise to the resolve?
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a04_10']	當知是人依不定聚，以法熏習善根力故，深信業果行十善道，厭生死苦求無上覺，值遇諸佛及諸菩薩，承事供養修行諸行，經十千劫信乃成就。	當知是人依不定聚，以法熏習善根力故，深信業果行十善道，厭生死苦求無上覺，值遇諸佛及諸菩薩，承事供養修行諸行，經十千劫信乃成就。	One should know that this person relies on the indeterminate aggregate. Due to the power of the cultivation of wholesome roots by the Dharma, they deeply believe in the fruits of karma and practice the ten wholesome deeds. Disgusted with the suffering of birth and death, they seek supreme enlightenment. Encountering the buddhas and bodhisattvas, they serve and make offerings, cultivate various practices, and after ten thousand kalpas, their faith is accomplished.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a06_7']	從是已後，或以諸佛菩薩教力、或以大悲、或因正法將欲壞滅，以護法故而能發心。	從是已後，或以諸佛菩薩教力、或以大悲、或因正法將欲壞滅，以護法故而能發心。	From this point on, either by the power of the teaching of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, or out of great compassion, or because the true Dharma is about to perish, they are able to give rise to the resolve in order to protect the Dharma.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a07_11']	既發心已，入正定聚畢竟不退，住佛種性勝因相應。	既發心已，入正定聚畢竟不退，住佛種性勝因相應。	Having given rise to the resolve, they enter the stage of definite accumulation, never retrogressing, and abide in the superior causes associated with the buddha lineage.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a13_4']	或有眾生久遠已來善根微少，煩惱深厚覆其心故，雖值諸佛及諸菩薩承事供養，唯種人天受生種子，或種二乘菩提種子，或有雖求大菩提道然根不定或進或退，或有值佛及諸菩薩供養承事修行諸行，未得滿足十千大劫中間遇緣而發於心。	或有眾生久遠已來善根微少，煩惱深厚覆其心故，雖值諸佛及諸菩薩承事供養，唯種人天受生種子，或種二乘菩提種子，或有雖求大菩提道然根不定或進或退，或有值佛及諸菩薩供養承事修行諸行，未得滿足十千大劫中間遇緣而發於心。	There are sentient beings who, for a long time, have had few wholesome roots and deep afflictions covering their minds. Although they encounter buddhas and bodhisattvas, serve and make offerings to them, they only plant seeds for rebirth in the human or heavenly realms, or plant seeds for the enlightenment of the two vehicles. Some, although seeking the path to great enlightenment, have unstable faculties and either progress or regress. Some, although encountering buddhas and bodhisattvas, making offerings and serving them, and practicing various practices, have not yet fulfilled ten thousand great eons, and in the meantime encounter conditions and give rise to the mind.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a13_9']	遇何等緣？	遇何等緣？	What kind of conditions do they encounter?
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a15_17']	所謂或見佛形相、或供養眾僧、或二乘所教、或見他發心，此等發心皆悉未定，若遇惡緣或時退墮二乘地故。	所謂或見佛形相、或供養眾僧、或二乘所教、或見他發心，此等發心皆悉未定，若遇惡緣或時退墮二乘地故。	Namely, either seeing the Buddha's physical form, or making offerings to the Saṅgha, or being taught by the two vehicles, or seeing others give rise to the mind. These kinds of giving rise to the mind are all still undetermined. If they encounter bad conditions, they may sometimes regress and fall into the stage of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a17_7']	復次信成就發心，略說有三，一發正直心，如理正念真如法故；	復次信成就發心，略說有三，一發正直心，如理正念真如法故；	Next, the giving rise to the mind of accomplishment through faith is briefly explained as threefold: first, giving rise to the mind of straightforwardness, correctly contemplating suchness in accordance with principle;
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a18_3']	二發深重心，樂集一切諸善行故；	二發深重心，樂集一切諸善行故；	Second, giving rise to a profound and sincere mind, joyfully accumulating all wholesome practices;
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a18_18']	三發大悲心，願拔一切眾生苦故。	三發大悲心，願拔一切眾生苦故。	Third, giving rise to a mind of great compassion, vowing to liberate all sentient beings from suffering.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a18_20']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a21_4']	一切眾生、一切諸法，皆同一法界、無有二相，據理但應正念真如，何假復修一切善行救一切眾生？	一切眾生、一切諸法，皆同一法界、無有二相，據理但應正念真如，何假復修一切善行救一切眾生？	All sentient beings and all dharmas are ultimately of the same Dharma realm, without duality. According to principle, one should only be mindful of suchness. Why is it necessary to cultivate all wholesome practices and save all sentient beings?
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a22_1']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a22_4', 'ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a24_6']	不然。🔽如摩尼寶本性明潔，在鑛穢中，假使有人勤加憶念，而不作方便不施功力，欲求清淨終不可得。	不然。 如摩尼寶本性明潔，在鑛穢中，假使有人勤加憶念，而不作方便不施功力，欲求清淨終不可得。	This is not so.🔽It is like a maṇi jewel, whose nature is originally clear and pure, but is in a state of defilement. Even if someone were to diligently contemplate it, without employing skillful means and exerting effort, they would never be able to attain purity.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a27_4']	真如之法亦復如是，體雖明潔具足功德，而被無邊客塵所染，假使有人勤加憶念，而不作方便不修諸行，欲求清淨終無得理。	真如之法亦復如是，體雖明潔具足功德，而被無邊客塵所染，假使有人勤加憶念，而不作方便不修諸行，欲求清淨終無得理。	The Dharma of suchness is also like this. Although its essence is clear and pure, endowed with merits, it is tainted by boundless adventitious dust. Even if someone were to diligently contemplate it, without employing skillful means and cultivating practices, they would never be able to attain purity.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a28_15']	是故要當集一切善行、救一切眾生，離彼無邊客塵垢染，顯現真法。	是故要當集一切善行、救一切眾生，離彼無邊客塵垢染，顯現真法。	Therefore, one must gather all wholesome practices and save all sentient beings, leaving behind the boundless defilements of guests and dust, and manifest the true Dharma.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a29_8']	彼方便行略有四種：	彼方便行略有四種：	Those skillful means are roughly of four kinds:
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589a29_15']	一行根本方便。	一行根本方便。	1. The fundamental skillful means of practice.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b01_15']	謂觀一切法本性無生，離於妄見不住生死。	謂觀一切法本性無生，離於妄見不住生死。	It means contemplating that all dharmas are originally unborn by nature, free from false views, and not dwelling in saṃsāra.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b03_10']	又觀一切法因緣和合業果不失，起於大悲修諸善行，攝化眾生不住涅槃。	又觀一切法因緣和合業果不失，起於大悲修諸善行，攝化眾生不住涅槃。	Moreover, contemplating that all dharmas are the combination of causes and conditions, and the fruits of karma are not lost, one gives rise to great compassion and cultivates wholesome practices to transform and guide sentient beings, not dwelling in nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b05_1']	以真如離於生死涅槃相故，此行隨順以為根本，是名行根本方便。	以真如離於生死涅槃相故，此行隨順以為根本，是名行根本方便。	Because suchness is free from the characteristics of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, this practice accords with it as its fundamental basis. This is called the fundamental skillful means of practice.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b05_8']	二能止息方便。	二能止息方便。	2. The skillful means of cessation.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b06_10']	所謂慚愧及以悔過，此能止息一切惡法令不增長。	所謂慚愧及以悔過，此能止息一切惡法令不增長。	It refers to shame, conscience, and repentance, which can stop all unwholesome dharmas from increasing.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b08_1']	以真如離一切過失相故，隨順真如止息諸惡，是名能止息方便。	以真如離一切過失相故，隨順真如止息諸惡，是名能止息方便。	Because suchness is free from all faults, in accordance with suchness, one ceases all evils. This is called the skillful means of cessation.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b08_9']	三生長善根方便。	三生長善根方便。	Third, the expedient means of cultivating wholesome roots.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b11_6']	謂於三寶所起愛敬心，尊重供養頂禮稱讚，隨喜勸請正信增長，乃至志求無上菩提，為佛法僧威力所護，業障清淨善根不退。	謂於三寶所起愛敬心，尊重供養頂禮稱讚，隨喜勸請正信增長，乃至志求無上菩提，為佛法僧威力所護，業障清淨善根不退。	This refers to giving rise to a mind of reverence and respect for the Three Jewels, making offerings, bowing one's head in reverence, praising, rejoicing, and requesting. With right faith increasing, one aspires for supreme enlightenment. Protected by the power of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, karmic hindrances are purified and wholesome roots do not regress.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b13_1']	以真如離一切障具一切功德故，隨順真如修行善業，是名生長善根方便。	以真如離一切障具一切功德故，隨順真如修行善業，是名生長善根方便。	Because suchness is free from all hindrances and endowed with all merits, one practices wholesome karma in accordance with suchness. This is called the expedient means of cultivating wholesome roots.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b13_9']	四大願平等方便。	四大願平等方便。	Fourth, the expedient means of the equality of the great vows.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b14_16']	謂發誓願盡未來際，平等救拔一切眾生，令其安住無餘涅槃。	謂發誓願盡未來際，平等救拔一切眾生，令其安住無餘涅槃。	This refers to making vows to equally rescue all sentient beings to the end of the future, causing them to abide in the nirvāṇa without remainder.
['ZH_T32_1667_002:0589b17_4']	以知一切法本性無二故、彼此平等故、究竟寂滅故，隨順真如此三種相發大誓願，是名大願平等方便。	以知一切法本性無二故、彼此平等故、究竟寂滅故，隨順真如此三種相發大誓願，是名大願平等方便。	Because one knows that the inherent nature of all dharmas is non-dual, they are mutually equal, and ultimately quiescent. In accordance with suchness, one makes great vows with these three characteristics. This is called the expedient means of the equality of the great vows.
