['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a02_5']	初問中怪前所引經文云。	初問中怪前所引經文云。	The first question wonders about the previous quoted sutra text, which says:
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a02_16']	如來藏者不在阿梨耶中。	如來藏者不在阿梨耶中。	The Tathagata-garbha is not in the alaya.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a03_1']	答意云。	答意云。	The meaning of the answer is:
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a03_10']	真與妄合方曰梨耶。	真與妄合方曰梨耶。	The true and the false are combined to be called alaya.

['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a04_4']	且約義說。	且約義說。	For the time being, it is explained according to the meaning,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a04_14']	則真妄二法悉在其中。	則真妄二法悉在其中。	then the two dharmas of the true and false are all in it.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a05_6']	由是梨耶為總真妄為別。	由是梨耶為總真妄為別。	Therefore, the alaya is the general, and the true and false are the specific.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a05_13']	只合言在總中。	只合言在總中。	It should only be said to be in the general,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a06_1']	不合言在別中。	不合言在別中。	it should not be said to be in the specific.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a06_7']	今既分動靜。	今既分動靜。	Now that movement and stillness are distinguished,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a06_16']	則使梨耶總義不成。	則使梨耶總義不成。	it causes the general meaning of the alaya to be incomplete.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a07_2']	無中可在故。	無中可在故。	There is no middle to be in, therefore,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a07_9']	云不在梨耶中。	云不在梨耶中。	it is said to not be in the alaya.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a08_4']	後問意云。	後問意云。	The question at the end is:
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a08_12']	今梨耶既通動靜。	今梨耶既通動靜。	Now that the ālaya is both moving and still,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a09_1']	應合亦在真如門。	應合亦在真如門。	it should also be in the gate of suchness.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a09_10']	何故獨在生滅門耶。	何故獨在生滅門耶。	Why is it only in the gate of arising and ceasing?
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a10_1']	答中且說唯在生滅門。	答中且說唯在生滅門。	The answer only says it is in the gate of arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a10_13']	意自然例知不在真如門也。	意自然例知不在真如門也。	The meaning naturally implies it is not in the gate of suchness.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a11_4']	以梨耶是起靜以成動。	以梨耶是起靜以成動。	Because the ālaya arises from stillness to form movement,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a11_10']	體不相離故。	體不相離故。	its essence is inseparable. Therefore,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a11_19']	靜隨動在此門中也。	靜隨動在此門中也。	stillness follows movement and is within this gate.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a12_4']	非直等者。	非直等者。	Not only...
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a12_7']	意云。	意云。	The meaning is:
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a12_15']	謂不動尚在動門。	謂不動尚在動門。	It is said that even stillness is in the gate of movement,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a13_2']	何況動靜兼者。	何況動靜兼者。	how much more so for that which combines movement and stillness.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a13_10']	何以下徵釋可知。	何以下徵釋可知。	The reason below can be understood.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a13_16']	應思準之者。	應思準之者。	One should contemplate and follow it means:

['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a14_15']	以梨耶雖有靜義。	以梨耶雖有靜義。	Although the ālaya has the meaning of stillness,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a15_4']	然不在真如門者。	然不在真如門者。	it is not in the gate of suchness.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a15_13']	以此靜是隨動之靜。	以此靜是隨動之靜。	This stillness is the stillness that follows movement,

['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a16_14']	靜體雖同靜義且異。	靜體雖同靜義且異。	Although the essence of stillness is the same, the meaning of stillness is different.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a17_3']	梨耶既動靜相帶。	梨耶既動靜相帶。	Since the ālaya combines movement and stillness,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a17_11']	故不在真如門也。	故不在真如門也。	Therefore, it is not in the gate of suchness.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a17_19']	以此門是唯靜故。	以此門是唯靜故。	Because this gate is only tranquil.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a18_6']	疏略不說此義。	疏略不說此義。	The commentary briefly does not explain this meaning.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a18_13']	乃云應思準之。	乃云應思準之。	It says, One should contemplate and follow it.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a19_9']	又若下二合釋二義二。	又若下二合釋二義二。	Again, below, the second is to combine the two meanings.

['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a21_7']	故前云。	故前云。	Therefore, the previous says:
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0339a21_16']	依如來藏有生滅心。	依如來藏有生滅心。	Based on the tathāgatagarbha, there is the mind of arising and ceasing.
