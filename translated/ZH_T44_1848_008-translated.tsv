['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a14_1']	以一切染法皆是不覺相故。	以一切染法皆是不覺相故。	008	Because all defiled dharmas are the characteristics of non-enlightenment.

['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a21_18']	然此二識分齊行相各不相是。	然此二識分齊行相各不相是。	008	However, the scope and mode of activity of these two consciousnesses are not the same.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a22_9']	以本識是體事識屬用。	以本識是體事識屬用。	008	The fundamental consciousness is the substance, while the active consciousness belongs to the function.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a22_16']	今以二本是體。	今以二本是體。	008	Now, since the two fundamentals are the substance,

['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a23_18']	行相相順。	行相相順。	008	The mode of activity is in accord with each other.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a24_8']	是故二本皆在其中。	是故二本皆在其中。	008	Therefore, the two fundamentals are both within it.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a24_13']	故下文云。	故下文云。	008	Thus, the text below says:
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a25_3']	以如來藏無前際故。	以如來藏無前際故。	008	Because the tathāgatagarbha has no prior limit,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a25_12']	無明之相亦無有始。	無明之相亦無有始。	008	the characteristics of ignorance also have no beginning.

['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a26_2']	始覺悟時。	始覺悟時。	008	when one awakens to enlightenment,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a26_11']	方有六麁託境而生。	方有六麁託境而生。	008	only then do the six coarsenesses arise in dependence on objects.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a27_1']	行相麁浮宜在麁分。	行相麁浮宜在麁分。	008	The mode of activity is coarse and floating, and should be in the coarse part.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a27_11']	是故此二在生起識中。	是故此二在生起識中。	008	Therefore, these two are in the consciousness that arises.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a28_2']	此則攝四覺歸二識也。	此則攝四覺歸二識也。	008	This then includes the four kinds of enlightenment and returns them to the two consciousnesses.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a28_13']	若約本下攝事識歸本識。	若約本下攝事識歸本識。	008	If, in terms of the basis, etc., one includes the active consciousness and returns it to the fundamental consciousness,
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a28_19']	以體用不二。	以體用不二。	008	it is because substance and function are not two.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a29_4']	如波與水。	如波與水。	008	Like waves and water.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341a29_15']	是故四義俱不離本識也。	是故四義俱不離本識也。	008	Therefore, the four meanings are all not apart from the fundamental consciousness.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341b01_6']	此即同前一生滅門耳。	此即同前一生滅門耳。	008	This is then the same as the previous arising and ceasing gate.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341b01_12']	但前約門說。	但前約門說。	008	But previously it was explained in terms of the gate.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341b01_18']	今約識論也。	今約識論也。	008	Now it is discussed in terms of consciousness.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341b02_9']	故云下結由是廣之成八。	故云下結由是廣之成八。	008	Therefore it is said below that by expanding it, it becomes eight.
['ZH_T44_1848_008:0341b02_14']	攝之成二。	攝之成二。	008	By subsuming it, it becomes two.
