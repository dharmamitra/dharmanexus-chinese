['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c03_14']	」今疏中所引，但取佛含眾生之義，故略引其初後耳，下更略引次之二藏。	」今疏中所引，但取佛含眾生之義，故略引其初後耳，下更略引次之二藏。	013	The passage quoted in the commentary now only takes the meaning of the Buddha containing sentient beings, so it only quotes the beginning and end. Below, it briefly quotes the next two kinds of storehouses.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c05_2']	二隱覆為藏者，道前猶為煩惱所覆眾生不見故。	二隱覆為藏者，道前猶為煩惱所覆眾生不見故。	013	Second, the storehouse of concealment means that before the path, it is still covered by afflictions, and sentient beings do not see it.

['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c13_4']	然第一文即〈出現〉偈云「如三世劫剎眾生，所有心念及根欲，如是等身皆現顯，是故正覺名無量。	然第一文即〈出現〉偈云「如三世劫剎眾生，所有心念及根欲，如是等身皆現顯，是故正覺名無量。	013	However, the first passage is the verse in the Manifestation chapter that says, Just like the kalpas, lands, and sentient beings of the three times, with their thoughts and faculties, all bodies are manifested and revealed. Therefore, perfect enlightenment is called immeasurable.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c13_19']	」今疏上二句，但略如及二字耳。	」今疏上二句，但略如及二字耳。	013	Now, the first two sentences in the commentary only briefly mention just like and two.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c14_16']	言「尚皆一身頓現」者，即長行中意。	言「尚皆一身頓現」者，即長行中意。	013	As for still all are suddenly manifested in one body, this is the meaning in the prose section.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c15_15']	經云「如來成正覺時，以一方便入善覺智三昧。	經云「如來成正覺時，以一方便入善覺智三昧。	013	The sutra says, When the Tathagata accomplished perfect enlightenment, he used a single skillful means to enter the samādhi of well-awakened wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c17_8']	入三昧已，於一成正覺廣大身，現一切眾生數等身，住其身中。	入三昧已，於一成正覺廣大身，現一切眾生數等身，住其身中。	013	Having entered samādhi, he manifested bodies equal in number to all sentient beings in a single vast body of perfect enlightenment, abiding within those bodies.

['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c19_13']	」然彼經長行以身攝身，偈頌之中明其總攝。	」然彼經長行以身攝身，偈頌之中明其總攝。	013	However, the prose section of that sutra uses the body to encompass the body, while the verses clarify the overall inclusion.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c20_18']	今但取長行之一身，對偈中之廣攝，以顯難思耳。	今但取長行之一身，對偈中之廣攝，以顯難思耳。	013	Now, I only take one body from the prose section, and compare it with the extensive inclusion in the verse, to show the inconceivability.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c22_1']	故言尚皆一身頓現者，此一「尚」字即是舉況。	故言尚皆一身頓現者，此一「尚」字即是舉況。	013	Therefore, it says still all in one body suddenly manifested. This single still word is precisely raising a condition.

['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c26_17']	」今疏引者，意通前半，正取大智以況一身，故但引初一句而已。	」今疏引者，意通前半，正取大智以況一身，故但引初一句而已。	013	The meaning of what the commentary quotes now is to通通 the first half, and it correctly takes great wisdom to compare it to one body, so it only quotes the first sentence.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0096c28_15']	疏「二佛在眾生」等者，眾生即因，因稱法界，法界攝法無遺，故眾生亦攝無遺矣。	疏「二佛在眾生」等者，眾生即因，因稱法界，法界攝法無遺，故眾生亦攝無遺矣。	013	The commentary says second, the Buddha is in sentient beings, etc. Sentient beings are the cause. The cause is called the Dharma realm. The Dharma realm includes all phenomena without exception, so sentient beings also include all without exception.

['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a01_8']	釋云：	釋云：	013	The explanation says:
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a02_2']	眾生心中真如是佛所證故。	眾生心中真如是佛所證故。	013	Because the suchness in the minds of sentient beings is what the Buddha has realized.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a02_17']	若爾，但是平等之理，何足為玄？	若爾，但是平等之理，何足為玄？	013	If that is so, it is just the principle of equality. What is so profound about it?
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a03_2']	故復次云：	故復次云：	013	Therefore, it continues, saying:
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a03_8']	本覺無異故。	本覺無異故。	013	Because the original enlightenment is no different.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a04_9']	謂佛本覺與眾生本覺無有二體，同一覺故。	謂佛本覺與眾生本覺無有二體，同一覺故。	013	It means that the original enlightenment of the Buddha and the original enlightenment of sentient beings are not two separate entities, because they are the same one enlightenment.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a05_2']	本覺即法身故，法身同故。	本覺即法身故，法身同故。	013	Because the original enlightenment is the Dharma body, and the Dharma bodies are the same.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a06_8']	「以始」下，若爾法身體同，眾生未證，佛證法身，復何相預？	「以始」下，若爾法身體同，眾生未證，佛證法身，復何相預？	013	If that is so, the essence of the Dharma body is the same, but sentient beings have not yet realized it. What does the Buddha's realization of the Dharma body have to do with them?
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a06_12']	故次云：	故次云：	013	Therefore, it continues, saying:
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a07_4']	以始同本，總在眾生心中。	以始同本，總在眾生心中。	013	Because the beginning is the same as the end, it is all in the minds of sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a08_4']	謂《起信》既言始覺同本覺，無復始本之異。	謂《起信》既言始覺同本覺，無復始本之異。	013	It means that since the Awakening of Faith says that the enlightened mind is the same as the original enlightened mind, there is no longer any difference between the beginning and the end.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a09_18']	生佛本覺既同，今佛始覺同本時，全同眾生本覺，是故全在眾生心中矣。	生佛本覺既同，今佛始覺同本時，全同眾生本覺，是故全在眾生心中矣。	013	Since the original enlightenment of sentient beings and Buddhas is the same, when the Buddhas' initial enlightenment becomes the same as the original [enlightenment], it is completely the same as the original enlightenment of sentient beings, and therefore it is completely within the minds of sentient beings.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a10_4']	復有問云：	復有問云：	013	There is another question:
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a10_19']	約體雖同，相用自別，豈得全同？	約體雖同，相用自別，豈得全同？	013	Although the essence is the same, the characteristics and functions are different. How can they be completely the same?
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a11_3']	故次云：	故次云：	013	Therefore, the next line says:
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a11_13']	從體起用，用不異體。	從體起用，用不異體。	013	The function arises from the essence, and the function is not different from the essence.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a12_8']	體既眾生之體，用豈離於眾生？	體既眾生之體，用豈離於眾生？	013	Since the essence is the essence of sentient beings, how can the function be apart from sentient beings?
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a13_11']	故依體起用，即是眾生心中真如用大，更無別佛。	故依體起用，即是眾生心中真如用大，更無別佛。	013	Therefore, the arising of function based on the essence is the great function of suchness in the minds of sentient beings, and there is no separate Buddha.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a14_16']	若爾，《起信論》中已有此義，何以獨名《華嚴》為別教耶？	若爾，《起信論》中已有此義，何以獨名《華嚴》為別教耶？	013	If that is so, since this meaning already exists in the Awakening of Faith, why is the Huayan [teaching] alone called the Distinct Teaching?
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a15_1']	故次釋云：	故次釋云：	013	Therefore, the next explanation says:
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a16_14']	《起信》雖明始本不二、三大攸同，而是自心各各修證，不言生佛二互全收。	《起信》雖明始本不二、三大攸同，而是自心各各修證，不言生佛二互全收。	013	Although the Awakening of Faith clarifies the non-duality of the initial and original [enlightenment] and the sameness of the three great [dharmas], it is the cultivation and realization of each individual's own mind, and does not speak of the complete inclusion of the two [aspects] of sentient beings and Buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a17_19']	是則用《起信》之文，成《華嚴》之義，妙之至也。	是則用《起信》之文，成《華嚴》之義，妙之至也。	013	This then uses the text of the Awakening of Faith to establish the meaning of the Flower Ornament Sutra, the most wondrous of all.

['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a20_11']	謂初佛攝生時即全攝，無前無後，故實非虛。	謂初佛攝生時即全攝，無前無後，故實非虛。	013	It means that when a Buddha first subsumes sentient beings, he completely subsumes them, without before or after, therefore real and not false.
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a21_1']	生攝非虛，教在生心；	生攝非虛，教在生心；	013	The subsumption of sentient beings is not false, the teaching is in the mind of sentient beings;
['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a21_12']	佛攝非虛，教在佛心耳。	佛攝非虛，教在佛心耳。	013	The subsumption of Buddhas is not false, the teaching is in the mind of the Buddhas.

['ZH_T36_1736_013:0097a23_2']	謂雖互相攝，不妨說聽宛然。	謂雖互相攝，不妨說聽宛然。	013	It means that although they mutually subsume each other, it does not hinder the distinctness of the speaker and listener.
