['ZH_T44_1839_001:0080c24_7']	方得成因。	方得成因。	Only then can it become a valid reason.
['ZH_T44_1839_001:0080c24_16']	故言但由智力等也。	故言但由智力等也。	Therefore, it says only by the power of knowledge, etc.
['ZH_T44_1839_001:0080c25_7']	亦可但由彼此知因智力。	亦可但由彼此知因智力。	Alternatively, it can be said that it is only by the power of the knowledge of the reason of both parties,
['ZH_T44_1839_001:0080c25_16']	信知有此所作性因。	信知有此所作性因。	that one can have confidence in knowing that this reason of being produced exists.
['ZH_T44_1839_001:0080c26_6']	方万所說聲無常義。	方万所說聲無常義。	Only then can one understand the meaning being discussed, that sound is impermanent.
