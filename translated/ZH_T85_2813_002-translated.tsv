['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c02_10']	所謂以依真如法故有無明者。	所謂以依真如法故有無明者。	It is said that based on the dharmas of true suchness, there is ignorance.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c03_1']	即舉覆熏無明體也。	即舉覆熏無明體也。	This brings up the perfuming that covers the essence of ignorance.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c03_11']	無明妄法不能自立故。	無明妄法不能自立故。	Because the deluded dharmas of ignorance cannot stand on their own,
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c03_19']	說依真有無明也。	說依真有無明也。	It explains that ignorance depends on the existence or non-existence of suchness.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c04_14']	以有無明染法因故即熏習真如者。	以有無明染法因故即熏習真如者。	Because ignorance is the cause of defiled dharmas, it then perfumes suchness.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c05_5']	根本無明覆熏義也。	根本無明覆熏義也。	This is the meaning of the fundamental ignorance covering and perfuming.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c05_14']	以熏習故有妄心者。	以熏習故有妄心者。	Because of perfuming, there is deluded mind.

['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c08_10']	即顯妄心習熏無明增其不了令起轉識故。	即顯妄心習熏無明增其不了令起轉識故。	This reveals that the deluded mind perfuming and habituating ignorance increases its non-understanding, causing the evolving consciousnesses to arise.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c09_1']	言不覺念起及現識。	言不覺念起及現識。	It is said that the thought of non-enlightenment arises and the consciousness of manifestation appears.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c09_8']	故言現妄境界。	故言現妄境界。	Therefore it is said to manifest deluded objects.

['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c10_15']	以有妄境界染法緣故即熏習妄心等者。	以有妄境界染法緣故即熏習妄心等者。	Because there are defiled dharmas of deluded objects as conditions, it then perfumes the deluded mind, and so on.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c11_6']	即顯境界資熏現識。	即顯境界資熏現識。	This reveals that the objects of the realm perfume and nourish the consciousness of manifestation,

['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c14_2']	此二皆是法執念故令其著者。	此二皆是法執念故令其著者。	Both of these are due to the grasping of the notion of dharmas, causing the one who grasps
