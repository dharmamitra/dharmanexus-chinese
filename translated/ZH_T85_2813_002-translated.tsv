['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c02_10']	所謂以依真如法故有無明者。	所謂以依真如法故有無明者。	002	It is said that based on the dharmas of true suchness, there is ignorance.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c03_1']	即舉覆熏無明體也。	即舉覆熏無明體也。	002	This brings up the perfuming that covers the essence of ignorance.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c03_11']	無明妄法不能自立故。	無明妄法不能自立故。	002	Because the deluded dharmas of ignorance cannot stand on their own,
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c03_19']	說依真有無明也。	說依真有無明也。	002	It explains that ignorance depends on the existence or non-existence of suchness.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c04_14']	以有無明染法因故即熏習真如者。	以有無明染法因故即熏習真如者。	002	Because ignorance is the cause of defiled dharmas, it then perfumes suchness.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c05_5']	根本無明覆熏義也。	根本無明覆熏義也。	002	This is the meaning of the fundamental ignorance covering and perfuming.

['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c07_10']	以有妄心乃至現妄境界者。	以有妄心乃至現妄境界者。	002	Because there is deluded mind, up to manifesting deluded objects,
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c08_10']	即顯妄心習熏無明增其不了令起轉識故。	即顯妄心習熏無明增其不了令起轉識故。	002	This reveals that the deluded mind perfuming and habituating ignorance increases its non-understanding, causing the evolving consciousnesses to arise.
['ZH_T85_2813_002:1105c09_1']	言不覺念起及現識。	言不覺念起及現識。	002	It is said that the thought of non-enlightenment arises and the consciousness of manifestation appears.
