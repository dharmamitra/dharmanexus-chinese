['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129a28_11']	於此六中前之五種，從先學位信解性生，即此總名時愛心解脫，恒時愛護及心解脫故。	於此六中前之五種，從先學位信解性生，即此總名時愛心解脫，恒時愛護及心解脫故。	Of these six, the first five are born from the nature of faith-and-understanding in the prior stage of learning. They are called the liberation of mind through love of time, because one always protects and loves the liberation of mind.

['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129b04_4']	不動法性說名為後，即此名為不動心解脫，以無退動及心解脫故。	不動法性說名為後，即此名為不動心解脫，以無退動及心解脫故。	The nature of the unshakable is called the latter, and it is called the unshakable liberation of mind, because it is unshakable and because it is the liberation of mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129b05_4']	亦說名為不時解脫，以不待時及解脫故。	亦說名為不時解脫，以不待時及解脫故。	It is also called liberation not dependent on time, because it is not dependent on time and is liberation.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129b06_4']	謂三摩地隨欲現前，不待勝緣和合時故。	謂三摩地隨欲現前，不待勝緣和合時故。	That is, samādhi appears as one wishes, not dependent on the coming together of superior conditions.

There are those who have the specific nature of the arhat who falls away and later cultivate their faculties and become the arhat who contemplates. Up to the immovable, you should explain as is appropriate.

['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129b16_8']	言思法者，謂懼退失恒思自害。	言思法者，謂懼退失恒思自害。	The arhat who contemplates is one who fears falling away and always contemplates his own destruction.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129b17_5']	言護法者，謂於所得喜自防護。	言護法者，謂於所得喜自防護。	The arhat who guards is one who delights in guarding the fruit he has attained.

['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129b23_15']	第三唯有恒時加行，第四唯有尊重加行，第五具二而是鈍根，第六利根具二加行。	第三唯有恒時加行，第四唯有尊重加行，第五具二而是鈍根，第六利根具二加行。	the third has only the practice of constant cultivation, the fourth has only the practice of utmost respect, the fifth has both but is of dull faculties, and the sixth has both practices and is of sharp faculties.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129b25_16']	退法種性非必定退，乃至堪達非必能達，但約容有建立此名，故六阿羅漢通三界皆有。	退法種性非必定退，乃至堪達非必能達，但約容有建立此名，故六阿羅漢通三界皆有。	Those of the nature that regresses do not necessarily regress, and those who are capable of penetrating insight are not necessarily able to penetrate insight. These names are established on the basis of the possibility of regression or penetration, and therefore the six kinds of arhats are found in all three realms.

Among them, the last four have falling away from their nature. The one kind of dharma of falling away does not have the principle of falling away from its nature, because this nature is the lowest.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c06_11']	五種皆有從果退義，雖俱有退然並非先。	五種皆有從果退義，雖俱有退然並非先。	The five kinds all have the meaning of falling away from their fruit. Although they both have falling away, they are not first.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c08_6']	謂諸無學先學位中所住種性，彼從此性必無退理，學無學道所成堅故。	謂諸無學先學位中所住種性，彼從此性必無退理，學無學道所成堅故。	That is, the lineage in which the post-learner abides in the stage of learning. He definitely does not retrogress from this lineage, because it is firm, being perfected by the path of learning and no-learning.

['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c11_10']	若住此位後修練根所得思等四種種性，彼從此性容有退理。	若住此位後修練根所得思等四種種性，彼從此性容有退理。	If one abides in this stage and later cultivates the four kinds of lineages such as reflection obtained through the training of faculties, he may retrogress from this lineage.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c13_1']	二先位中住思等性，必亦無退此所得果，唯先退法有退果義。	二先位中住思等性，必亦無退此所得果，唯先退法有退果義。	The two who abide in the lineage of reflection, etc. in the previous stage, definitely do not retrogress from the fruit obtained from this. Only the one of the dharma of retrogressing has the meaning of retrogressing from the fruit.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c14_10']	又亦無退先所得果，後所得果容有退義，是故定無退預流果。	又亦無退先所得果，後所得果容有退義，是故定無退預流果。	Also, there is definitely no retrogressing from the fruit previously obtained. The fruit obtained later may have the meaning of retrogressing. Therefore, there is definitely no retrogressing from the fruit of stream-entry.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c15_1']	由此應果退法有三：	由此應果退法有三：	By this, the one who is bound to retrogress among the candidates for the fruit of arhatship is of three kinds:

['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c17_1']	思法有四，三如前說，更加一種退住退性。	思法有四，三如前說，更加一種退住退性。	The one of the dharma of reflection is of four kinds: three are as explained above, and one more kind is added: one who retrogresses and abides in the nature of retrogressing.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c18_1']	餘三如次有五六七，應知後後一一增故。	餘三如次有五六七，應知後後一一增故。	The remaining three have five, six, and seven, respectively, because each is one more than the preceding.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c18_17']	思法等四退住學位，時還住退非餘。	思法等四退住學位，時還住退非餘。	The four types of persons such as those who are freed through predominance of faith, when they fall back to the stage of learners, return to the stage of falling back, not to the other stages.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c19_15']	若異此者，得勝種性故，應是進非退。	若異此者，得勝種性故，應是進非退。	If this were not so, then because they would have obtained a superior spiritual gene, they would be advancing, not falling back.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c20_5']	何緣定無退先果者？	何緣定無退先果者？	Why is it definitely the case that one does not fall back from the first fruit of a śrāmanya?
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c20_14']	以見所斷依無事故。	以見所斷依無事故。	Because the object of the passions eliminated by the path of insight does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c22_13']	謂有身見依我處轉，見所斷惑此見為根，我體既無名依無事，以無事故必無退理。	謂有身見依我處轉，見所斷惑此見為根，我體既無名依無事，以無事故必無退理。	The view of real personhood evolves on the basis of a self, and the passions eliminated by the path of insight have this view as their root. Since the substance of a self does not exist, it is said that it is based on a nonexistent object. Because the object does not exist, it is definitely the case that there is no falling back.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c23_14']	若爾，應說此惑緣無，非此緣無，諦為境故。	若爾，應說此惑緣無，非此緣無，諦為境故。	If this is so, then you should say that these passions have a nonexistent object, but they do not have a nonexistent object, because they have the truths as their objects.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c24_14']	然於諦境不如實緣，諸煩惱中誰不如是？	然於諦境不如實緣，諸煩惱中誰不如是？	However, they do not really have the truths as their objects. Which of the passions is not like this?
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c26_15']	雖皆如是而有差別，以修斷惑各有別事，即是可意不可意等，於所緣境此相非無。	雖皆如是而有差別，以修斷惑各有別事，即是可意不可意等，於所緣境此相非無。	Even though they are all like this, there is a difference, because the passions eliminated by the path of cultivation have their own individual objects, which are agreeable, disagreeable, etc. The characteristics of these objects are not nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c28_5']	見所斷惑計有我等，非諸諦境有我等相，以無事故與修斷別。	見所斷惑計有我等，非諸諦境有我等相，以無事故與修斷別。	The views of self, etc., that are eliminated by the path of insight do not have the self, etc., as objects, because the self, etc., do not exist. They differ from the passions eliminated by cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0129c29_14']	謂於色等所緣境中，我見妄增作者受者自在而轉，非實我性。	謂於色等所緣境中，我見妄增作者受者自在而轉，非實我性。	That is, in the objects of form, etc., the view of self falsely increases the doer, the experiencer, and the one who is sovereign, but the nature of a real self does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a01_13']	邊執見等隨此而生，故並說為依無事惑。	邊執見等隨此而生，故並說為依無事惑。	The views of grasping extremes, etc., are born in accordance with this, and therefore they are all said to be passions that are not based on objects.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a03_12']	若修所斷貪瞋慢癡，色等境中唯起染著增背高舉不了行轉，故並說為依有事惑。	若修所斷貪瞋慢癡，色等境中唯起染著增背高舉不了行轉，故並說為依有事惑。	The passions of craving, hatred, pride, and delusion that are eliminated by the path of cultivation only generate the activities of defilement, increase in aversion, arrogance, and ignorance in regard to objects such as form, etc. Therefore they are all said to be passions that are based on objects.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a05_3']	又見斷惑於諦理中執我我所斷常見等，非諦中有少我等事。	又見斷惑於諦理中執我我所斷常見等，非諦中有少我等事。	Also, the passions that are eliminated by the path of insight grasp the truth of the four noble truths as a self, a possession of a self, annihilation, eternity, etc., but there is not the slightest thing such as a self in the truths.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a06_3']	見斷貪等緣此而生，是故皆名依無事惑。	見斷貪等緣此而生，是故皆名依無事惑。	Craving, etc., that are eliminated by insight are born in dependence on this, and therefore they are all said to be passions that are not based on objects.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a08_2']	修所斷惑於色等中謂好醜等，然色等境非無少分好醜等別，是故可名依有事惑。	修所斷惑於色等中謂好醜等，然色等境非無少分好醜等別，是故可名依有事惑。	The passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation are good, bad, etc., in regard to form, etc., but form, etc., as objects are not without some differences of good, bad, etc. Therefore they can be said to be passions that are based on objects.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a09_11']	又見斷惑迷諦理起名依無事，修所斷惑迷麁事生名依有事。	又見斷惑迷諦理起名依無事，修所斷惑迷麁事生名依有事。	Also, the delusions eliminated by the path of insight arise on the basis of the principle of the truths and are called delusions that do not have a basis in reality. The delusions eliminated by the path of cultivation arise on the basis of gross things and are called delusions that have a basis in reality.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a10_3']	諦理真實，揩定可依。	諦理真實，揩定可依。	The principle of the truths is real and fixed and can be relied on.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a11_12']	聖慧已證必無退理，事相浮偽無定可依，斷迷彼惑有失念退。	聖慧已證必無退理，事相浮偽無定可依，斷迷彼惑有失念退。	Since holy wisdom has already realized it, there is no possibility of falling away from it. The characteristics of things are superficial and unreal and cannot be relied on. One can fall away from the elimination of delusions that delude one about them because of loss of mindfulness.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a12_8']	或修斷惑非審慮生，昧鈍性故。	或修斷惑非審慮生，昧鈍性故。	Or, delusions eliminated by the path of cultivation do not arise from careful consideration, because their nature is dull.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a13_3']	見所斷惑由審慮生，推度性故。	見所斷惑由審慮生，推度性故。	Delusions eliminated by the path of insight arise from careful consideration, because their nature is that of conjecture.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a14_12']	聖不審慮於麁事中失念或生，審慮不爾，如於繩等率爾謂蛇。	聖不審慮於麁事中失念或生，審慮不爾，如於繩等率爾謂蛇。	Holy teachings do not arise from careful consideration of gross things, because of loss of mindfulness. Careful consideration does not occur in this way, as when one suddenly mistakes a rope for a snake.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a15_12']	故修斷惑聖有退起，非由率爾可起見惑。	故修斷惑聖有退起，非由率爾可起見惑。	Therefore, holy teachings can arise from the delusions eliminated by the path of cultivation, but not from the delusions eliminated by the path of insight.
['ZH_T29_1558_025:0130a16_12']	聖若審慮便見諦理，故聖見斷定無退義。	聖若審慮便見諦理，故聖見斷定無退義。	If holy teachings carefully consider, they realize the principle of the truths. Therefore, there is definitely no falling away from the elimination of delusions by the path of insight.
