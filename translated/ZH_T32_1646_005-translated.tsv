['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b08_9']	是故可疑業力不可思議。	是故可疑業力不可思議。	005	Therefore, the power of karma is inconceivable.

['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b10_18']	又外道說五根從我生，我即非色。	又外道說五根從我生，我即非色。	005	Moreover, non-Buddhists say that the five faculties are produced from the self, and the self is not form.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b11_13']	又言五根知大知小，故非決定。	又言五根知大知小，故非決定。	005	They also say that the five faculties can perceive the large and the small, so they are not definite.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b12_17']	是人亦以無色為根，是故佛言諸根是色因色等成。	是人亦以無色為根，是故佛言諸根是色因色等成。	005	These people also take the formless as faculties. Therefore, the Buddha says that the faculties are form and are produced from form, etc.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b14_7']	或謂因色等成應可見故，說不可見，亦非耳等根之所得。	或謂因色等成應可見故，說不可見，亦非耳等根之所得。	005	Or it is said that if it is formed from causes such as form, it should be visible, so it is said to be invisible, and also not obtained by the ear and other faculties.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b15_8']	或謂若爾便應無對，故說有對，對諸塵故。	或謂若爾便應無對，故說有對，對諸塵故。	005	Or it is said that if it is so, it should be unobstructing, so it is said to be obstructing, because it obstructs various objects.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b16_7']	若色有形有對，是名麁色，但眼所見。	若色有形有對，是名麁色，但眼所見。	005	If form has shape and obstruction, it is called coarse form, which is only seen by the eyes.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b19_13']	又外道言，諸數量一異合離好醜作業總相別相及陀羅驃，雖非色法亦是可見，故佛說言於此等中但色可見非餘法也，礙於手等故名有對。	又外道言，諸數量一異合離好醜作業總相別相及陀羅驃，雖非色法亦是可見，故佛說言於此等中但色可見非餘法也，礙於手等故名有對。	005	Moreover, non-Buddhists say that number, quantity, one, different, combination, separation, good, bad, action, general characteristics, specific characteristics, and atoms, although not dharmas of form, are also visible, so the Buddha said that among these, only form is visible, not other dharmas. Because it obstructs the hand and other things, it is called obstructing.

['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b20_7']	若爾，皆應受觸。	若爾，皆應受觸。	005	If so, then all should experience touch.

['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b22_4']	復次諸根實非決定。	復次諸根實非決定。	005	Moreover, the faculties are actually not definite.

['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b23_15']	法若決定，如手取物唯取一手，眼能見大小，故非定也。	法若決定，如手取物唯取一手，眼能見大小，故非定也。	005	If dharmas were determinate, like the hand grasping an object only grasping one hand, the eye could see only large or only small. Therefore, it is not determinate.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b24_16']	又若定，物觸則有作，如觸火則燒、觸刀則割；	又若定，物觸則有作，如觸火則燒、觸刀則割；	005	Moreover, if determinate, then contact would have action, like touching fire being burned and touching a knife being cut;
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b25_8']	眼遠而能見，故非決定。	眼遠而能見，故非決定。	005	the eye is distant yet able to see, therefore it is not determinate.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b27_7']	又若法決定，則礙決定法，如手礙手，眼於水精雲翳等中亦不障礙，故非決定。	又若法決定，則礙決定法，如手礙手，眼於水精雲翳等中亦不障礙，故非決定。	005	Moreover, if dharmas were determinate, then they would obstruct determinate dharmas, like hand obstructing hand. The eye is not obstructed by water, crystal, clouds, etc. Therefore, it is not determinate.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b28_14']	又根若決定，應在身內，在身內故，雖與意合亦應不見外塵；	又根若決定，應在身內，在身內故，雖與意合亦應不見外塵；	005	Moreover, if the faculties were determinate, they should be within the body. Being within the body, even if combined with the mind, they should not see external objects;
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272b29_7']	而實能見，故非決定。	而實能見，故非決定。	005	yet they are actually able to see, therefore they are not determinate.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c01_1']	又法若決定，則可數名五根；	又法若決定，則可數名五根；	005	Moreover, if dharmas were determinate, then they could be counted as the five faculties;
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c02_2']	而眼等各二并舌與身是名為八，故非決定。	而眼等各二并舌與身是名為八，故非決定。	005	yet the eye, etc. each have two, and the tongue and body are called the eight. Therefore, they are not determinate.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c02_12']	但處有定，根非定也。	但處有定，根非定也。	005	But the location is determinate, the faculties are not determinate.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c04_4']	又左眼見，右眼亦識，不應異見異識，以根無左右根故，非是決定。	又左眼見，右眼亦識，不應異見異識，以根無左右根故，非是決定。	005	Moreover, if the left eye sees and the right eye also perceives, then the seeing and perceiving should be different, because the sense organ has no left and right. This is not definite.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c05_1']	又根塵合法不可得故，無決定也。	又根塵合法不可得故，無決定也。	005	Moreover, the combination of sense organ and object cannot be obtained, so there is no definiteness.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c06_7']	又得決定色等法則不能覺，得根則覺，故非決定。	又得決定色等法則不能覺，得根則覺，故非決定。	005	Moreover, if one obtains definite form and so forth, then one cannot perceive. If one obtains the sense organ, then one perceives. Therefore, it is not definite.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c06_10']	問曰：	問曰：	005	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c08_15']	眼光能見大小亦能遠去見色無有障礙，猶如日光離身能見，是光因二眼定處合為一光而能見色。	眼光能見大小亦能遠去見色無有障礙，猶如日光離身能見，是光因二眼定處合為一光而能見色。	005	The light of the eye can see far and near, and can see forms without obstruction, just like sunlight. It can see by leaving the body. This light combines the two eyes to form a single light and can see forms.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c09_13']	又眼是一，耳鼻在內，不可分別。	又眼是一，耳鼻在內，不可分別。	005	Moreover, the eyes are one, while the ears and nose are inside and cannot be distinguished.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c10_8']	是故汝說異見異識，此言則壞。	是故汝說異見異識，此言則壞。	005	Therefore, your statement that the seeing and perceiving are different is destroyed.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c11_1']	又神知非根，根是所用。	又神知非根，根是所用。	005	Moreover, the spirit's knowledge is not the sense organ. The sense organ is what is used.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c13_8']	又汝言合法不可得者，是事已答，謂日光映等、耳等諸根和合密故亦不可得，如合木密，際不可知。	又汝言合法不可得者，是事已答，謂日光映等、耳等諸根和合密故亦不可得，如合木密，際不可知。	005	Moreover, your statement that the combination of factors cannot be perceived has already been answered, namely, because the light of the sun and so forth, and the ears and other faculties are closely combined, they also cannot be perceived, just like the edge of a closely fitting piece of wood cannot be known.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c13_19']	又因神故覺，非是諸根。	又因神故覺，非是諸根。	005	Moreover, because of the spirit, there is awareness, not because of the faculties.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c14_14']	又根由大成，大無覺故根亦非覺。	又根由大成，大無覺故根亦非覺。	005	Moreover, the faculties are composed of the great elements, and since the great elements are without awareness, the faculties are also not aware.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c16_5']	又瓶因微塵，如微塵無覺瓶亦無覺，又不知異塵故知無覺。	又瓶因微塵，如微塵無覺瓶亦無覺，又不知異塵故知無覺。	005	Moreover, the pot is caused by the subtle particles, just as the subtle particles are without awareness, the pot is also without awareness. Moreover, because it is not known to be different from the particles, it is known to be without awareness.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c16_8']	答曰：	答曰：	005	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c17_14']	汝言光去故根是決定，汝以光為根，光非定故根亦不定。	汝言光去故根是決定，汝以光為根，光非定故根亦不定。	005	You say that because the light goes, the faculty is definite. You take the light to be the faculty, but because the light is not definite, the faculty is also not definite.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c18_6']	又此光無，先已破故。	又此光無，先已破故。	005	Moreover, this light does not exist, because it has already been refuted earlier.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c19_18']	又汝言一眼，是事不然，一眼見異、二眼見異，若一眼壞，見則不明。	又汝言一眼，是事不然，一眼見異、二眼見異，若一眼壞，見則不明。	005	Moreover, your statement that it is one eye is not so. Seeing with one eye is different, seeing with two eyes is different. If one eye is damaged, seeing is not clear.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c20_8']	是左右眼，先已答。	是左右眼，先已答。	005	This is the left and right eye, which has already been answered earlier.

['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c22_9']	以鼻隔故，不得為一。	以鼻隔故，不得為一。	005	Because of the nasal septum, they cannot be one.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c23_6']	設無障隔，亦不為一，如手指等。	設無障隔，亦不為一，如手指等。	005	Even if there were no obstruction, they would still not be one, like fingers and so on.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c24_4']	汝言是神所用，是事先破神不能用。	汝言是神所用，是事先破神不能用。	005	You say that this is used by the spirit, but this has already been refuted that the spirit cannot use it.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c24_14']	日光映者，是亦先破。	日光映者，是亦先破。	005	The illumination by sunlight has also been refuted earlier.

['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c25_14']	所以者何？	所以者何？	005	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c27_11']	法若決定則無和合，體相異故，如合木雖密猶見其際，根塵和合不見如是。	法若決定則無和合，體相異故，如合木雖密猶見其際，根塵和合不見如是。	005	If dharmas are determined, then there is no combination, because their essential characteristics are different. Even if wood is combined densely, one still sees its edges. The combination of faculties and objects is not seen in this way.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c28_6']	汝言以神故覺，當說無神。	汝言以神故覺，當說無神。	005	You say that because of the spirit there is awareness. We should explain that there is no spirit.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0272c29_10']	汝言諸大成根，是事不然，業力變大為根則有差別。	汝言諸大成根，是事不然，業力變大為根則有差別。	005	You say that the faculties are formed from the great elements. This is not so. The great elements are transformed into faculties by the power of karma, and then there are distinctions.

['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a04_1']	又大變為根，大決定故，所變成法亦應決定。	又大變為根，大決定故，所變成法亦應決定。	005	Moreover, when the great elements transform into faculties, because the great elements are fixed, the transformed dharmas should also be fixed.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a05_13']	又當根有塵、當塵有根，若不決定，不應相當，應如意法，故知決定。	又當根有塵、當塵有根，若不決定，不應相當，應如意法，故知決定。	005	Moreover, faculties correspond to objects, and objects correspond to faculties. If they were not fixed, they would not correspond. They should be like mental dharmas. Therefore, we know they are fixed.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a06_11']	又世間人於童子等決定法中說名諸根。	又世間人於童子等決定法中說名諸根。	005	Moreover, worldly people speak of the faculties as fixed dharmas among children and others.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a07_12']	又根知五種定法，非如意等，故名決定。	又根知五種定法，非如意等，故名決定。	005	Moreover, the faculties cognize five kinds of fixed dharmas, not like mental dharmas and others, so they are called fixed.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a08_8']	又根知現在，餘皆比知，故名決定。	又根知現在，餘皆比知，故名決定。	005	Moreover, the faculties cognize the present, while the others all infer. Therefore, they are called fixed.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a09_5']	又根知有緣意亦無緣，如知過去等。	又根知有緣意亦無緣，如知過去等。	005	Moreover, the faculties cognize with conditions, while the mind also cognizes without conditions, like cognizing the past and so forth.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a10_13']	又根塵和合故生根知法，應以決定根對決定塵，故知決定。	又根塵和合故生根知法，應以決定根對決定塵，故知決定。	005	Moreover, the dharmas cognized by the faculties arise from the combination of faculties and objects. The faculties should correspond to fixed objects. Therefore, we know they are fixed.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a10_16']	答曰：	答曰：	005	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a12_15']	汝言根由大成名決定者，雖俱由諸大，而有是根非根，如是或有決定、或不決定。	汝言根由大成名決定者，雖俱由諸大，而有是根非根，如是或有決定、或不決定。	005	You say that the faculties are definitely formed from the great elements, but although they are all formed from the great elements, some are faculties and some are not. It is the same with the definite and the indefinite.
['ZH_T32_1646_005:0273a13_10']	汝言利益，利益於知非助根也。	汝言利益，利益於知非助根也。	005	You say that benefit is for knowledge, but it does not assist the faculties.
