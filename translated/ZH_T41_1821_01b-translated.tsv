['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a15_4']	如何說成。	如何說成。	01b	How can they be said to be accomplished?
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a15_7']	解云。	解云。	01b	Explanation:
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a15_16']	由心力能親發化故。	由心力能親發化故。	01b	Because the power of the mind can directly produce transformation,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a16_3']	可說成就。	可說成就。	01b	it can be said to be accomplished.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a16_12']	簫笛等聲即不如是。	簫笛等聲即不如是。	01b	The sounds of flutes and pipes are not like this,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a17_3']	故不成就　又解。	故不成就　又解。	01b	so they are not accomplished. Another explanation:
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a17_10']	化語無有實名。	化語無有實名。	01b	The transformed speech does not have real names.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a18_2']	論言化語是有情名聲者。	論言化語是有情名聲者。	01b	The treatise says that the transformed speech is the sound of sentient beings' names,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a18_7']	似有情名。	似有情名。	01b	which resembles the names of sentient beings,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a18_13']	非實有情名。	非實有情名。	01b	but is not the real names of sentient beings.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a19_2']	如鏡中火似真火。	如鏡中火似真火。	01b	Like the fire in a mirror, which resembles real fire,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a19_12']	而非真火　既非實名。	而非真火　既非實名。	01b	but is not real fire. Since it is not a real name,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a19_17']	亦非成就。	亦非成就。	01b	it is also not accomplished.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a20_8']	化語非業　婆沙解。	化語非業　婆沙解。	01b	The transformed speech is not an action. The Abhidharma-vibhāṣā explains:
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a20_16']	化語是業．非業。	化語是業．非業。	01b	The transformed speech is both an action and not an action.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a21_2']	既無評家。	既無評家。	01b	Since there is no definitive conclusion,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a22_4']	且以後師為正　又此論業品亦同婆沙後師。	且以後師為正　又此論業品亦同婆沙後師。	01b	we will follow the later masters as correct. Moreover, this treatise on karma is also the same as the later masters in the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a22_9']	故業品云。	故業品云。	01b	Therefore, the treatise on karma says:
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a22_15']	散依等流性。	散依等流性。	01b	The nature of the scattered is that of the same kind.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a22_18']	有受。	有受。	01b	There is feeling.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a23_10']	異大生　解表大種同散無表。	異大生　解表大種同散無表。	01b	The great elements that are different from the great elements that give rise to the manifest are explained to be the same as the great elements of the unmanifest.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a23_17']	用執受大種造。	用執受大種造。	01b	It is produced using the great elements that are grasped.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a24_10']	化語既不用執受大種造。	化語既不用執受大種造。	01b	Since the voice of transformation does not use the great elements that are grasped to be produced,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a25_5']	明知非業　化語雖非是業。	明知非業　化語雖非是業。	01b	it is clear that it is not karma. Although the voice of transformation is not karma,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a26_2']	而得名語　由心力能親發起故。	而得名語　由心力能親發起故。	01b	it can be called accomplished, because it is able to directly give rise to it by the power of the mind.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a26_17']	可言成就　簫．笛等聲雖名為語。	可言成就　簫．笛等聲雖名為語。	01b	The sounds of flutes and pipes, although called speech,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a27_4']	非親發起。	非親發起。	01b	are not directly given rise to.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a27_9']	故不成就。	故不成就。	01b	Therefore they are not accomplished.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a27_14']	若作前解。	若作前解。	01b	If the previous explanation is made,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a28_5']	釋後證言同散無表者。	釋後證言同散無表者。	01b	the explanation of the later proof that it is the same as the scattered unmanifest is
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a28_11']	據非化語業。	據非化語業。	01b	based on the karma of non-transformation speech.
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a28_17']	若據化語業。	若據化語業。	01b	If it is based on the karma of transformation speech,
