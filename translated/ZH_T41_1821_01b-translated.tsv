['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a18_2']	論言化語是有情名聲者。	論言化語是有情名聲者。	The treatise says that the transformed speech is the sound of sentient beings' names,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a18_7']	似有情名。	似有情名。	which resembles the names of sentient beings,
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a18_13']	非實有情名。	非實有情名。	but is not the real names of sentient beings.

['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a28_5']	釋後證言同散無表者。	釋後證言同散無表者。	the explanation of the later proof that it is the same as the scattered unmanifest is
['ZH_T41_1821_01b:0019a28_11']	據非化語業。	據非化語業。	based on the karma of non-transformation speech.
