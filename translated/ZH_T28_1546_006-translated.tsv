['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a16_8']	前說二心不得展轉相因。	前說二心不得展轉相因。	006	Previously it was said that two minds cannot be mutually causes of each other.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a17_5']	無有一人前後二心俱生故。	無有一人前後二心俱生故。	006	Because there is no one person whose two minds arise simultaneously before and after.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a21_5']	以何等故一人前後二心不俱生者，答無第二次第緣，此說心心數法依次第緣生，未來世法依現在世法和合則生，不和合則不生。	以何等故一人前後二心不俱生者，答無第二次第緣，此說心心數法依次第緣生，未來世法依現在世法和合則生，不和合則不生。	006	As for the question of why two minds of one person do not arise simultaneously before and after, the answer is that there is no second immediately antecedent condition. This explains that mind and mental factors arise in dependence on the immediately antecedent condition. Phenomena in the future arise in combination with phenomena in the present. If they do not combine, they do not arise.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a22_5']	現在若與未來次第則生，不與次第則不生。	現在若與未來次第則生，不與次第則不生。	006	If the present [mind] is with the future, it will arise in sequence, if not in sequence it will not arise.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a24_9']	一一心次第生，不得有二。	一一心次第生，不得有二。	006	Each mind arises in sequence, not two can exist.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a25_2']	無第二次第緣故。	無第二次第緣故。	006	Because there is no second condition as an immediately preceding state.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a26_10']	答曰：	答曰：	006	The answer is:
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a27_4']	眾生一一心次第生，不得有二。	眾生一一心次第生，不得有二。	006	Sentient beings each have one mind arising in sequence, not two can exist.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a28_3']	以何等故眾生一一心次第生不得有二？	以何等故眾生一一心次第生不得有二？	006	Why is it that sentient beings each have one mind arising in sequence, not two can exist?
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a28_6']	答曰：	答曰：	006	The answer is:
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037a29_2']	無第二次第緣，是名展轉更相答義。	無第二次第緣，是名展轉更相答義。	006	There is no second condition as an immediately preceding state, this is called the meaning of answering each other in turn.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b01_13']	如現在有一次第緣，未來生一心，是中應說如園中閉眾多羊門俠小喻。	如現在有一次第緣，未來生一心，是中應說如園中閉眾多羊門俠小喻。	006	Just as there is one condition as an immediately preceding state in the present, one mind arises in the future, here one should explain the analogy of many sheep being closed in a garden with a small gate.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b03_2']	如羊園俠小門中一一羊出，彼心心法生亦復如是。	如羊園俠小門中一一羊出，彼心心法生亦復如是。	006	Just as in a sheep pen with a small door, each sheep comes out one by one, so is the arising of those minds and mental factors.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b04_18']	現在一剎那與未來剎那開次，設現在世有眾多剎那者，則與未來眾多剎那開次。	現在一剎那與未來剎那開次，設現在世有眾多剎那者，則與未來眾多剎那開次。	006	The present one moment opens the sequence with the future moment. If there are many moments in the present world, then it opens the sequence with many moments in the future.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b05_17']	以無故，現在一剎那與未來一剎那開次。	以無故，現在一剎那與未來一剎那開次。	006	Because there is no [present moment], the present one moment opens the sequence with the future one moment.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b08_3']	或有說者，如命根是一剎那，依命根心亦一剎那，是故不俱。	或有說者，如命根是一剎那，依命根心亦一剎那，是故不俱。	006	Some say that just as the life faculty is one moment, the mind dependent on the life faculty is also one moment, and therefore they do not arise together.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b09_10']	復有說者，如身根是一剎那，依身根心亦一剎那，是故不俱。	復有說者，如身根是一剎那，依身根心亦一剎那，是故不俱。	006	Some say that just as the body faculty is one moment, the mind dependent on the body faculty is also one moment, and therefore they do not arise together.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b10_8']	復有說者，若二心俱生，則心不可調伏。	復有說者，若二心俱生，則心不可調伏。	006	Some say that if two minds arise together, then the mind cannot be tamed.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b11_3']	如今一心猶剛強難伏，何況二心。	如今一心猶剛強難伏，何況二心。	006	If even one mind is still difficult to subdue, how much more so two minds?
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b12_14']	復有說者，若二心俱生者，則一時有煩惱出要，一心煩惱、一心出要。	復有說者，若二心俱生者，則一時有煩惱出要，一心煩惱、一心出要。	006	There is another explanation: if two minds arise together, then at the same time there would be afflictions and liberation, with one mind being afflicted and one mind liberated.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b13_11']	若爾者，則無解、無離、無乘如是等過。	若爾者，則無解、無離、無乘如是等過。	006	If that were so, then there would be no liberation, no separation, no vehicle, and so on, with such faults.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b14_6']	復有說者，若二心俱生，何妨有三？	復有說者，若二心俱生，何妨有三？	006	There is another explanation: if two minds arise together, what is wrong with there being three?
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b14_20']	若有三者，則三界身可一時受。	若有三者，則三界身可一時受。	006	If there are three, then the bodies of the three realms could be simultaneously experienced.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b17_2']	若三界一時受身則破界，若界破一人亦是欲界亦是色界無色界，若然則無解脫，乃至廣說。	若三界一時受身則破界，若界破一人亦是欲界亦是色界無色界，若然則無解脫，乃至廣說。	006	If the bodies of the three realms are simultaneously experienced, then the realms are destroyed. If the realms are destroyed, then a single person would be both the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm. If that were so, then there would be no liberation, and so on, explained in detail.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b17_13']	若三心俱生，何妨有四。	若三心俱生，何妨有四。	006	If three minds arise together, what is wrong with there being four?

If that were so, then the four modes of birth would be destroyed. A single body would be both womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and spontaneously born. Then there would be no liberation, and so on, explained in detail.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b22_2']	若然者，則五道壞。	若然者，則五道壞。	006	If so, then the five realms would be destroyed.
['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b23_2']	若五道壞，地獄身乃至即是天身，乃至廣說。	若五道壞，地獄身乃至即是天身，乃至廣說。	006	If the five realms are destroyed, then a hell body would be the same as a heavenly body, and so on.

['ZH_T28_1546_006:0037b26_4']	若然，則無未來。	若然，則無未來。	006	If so, then there is no future.

If there is no future, then there is no present, and if there is no present, then there is no past. If there is no past, then there are no conditioned phenomena. If there are no conditioned phenomena, then there are no unconditioned phenomena.
