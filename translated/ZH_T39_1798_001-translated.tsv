Therefore, the Tathagata manifests his wisdom aspect, called Mara, which can cause those who delight in defilement and purity to be unable to be self-sufficient.
['ZH_T39_1798_001:0819c08_1']	摩羅者，具足梵音云摩爛拏，此正翻為殺者，如其智印所謂弓箭。	摩羅者，具足梵音云摩爛拏，此正翻為殺者，如其智印所謂弓箭。	001	Mara, in full Sanskrit, is called marana, which is correctly translated as killer, and its wisdom seal is called a bow and arrow.

With the power of this wisdom seal, he can strike and shoot, subduing them and not allowing them to remain for long. Therefore, he uses defiled wisdom to subdue that pure wisdom, thus called the killer.
['ZH_T39_1798_001:0819c13_17']	或有菩薩發廣大心作大佛事，有佛菩薩住於自宮不助其力，而此菩薩即以此智印向彈擊之，彼佛菩薩便當隨喜而共加持。	或有菩薩發廣大心作大佛事，有佛菩薩住於自宮不助其力，而此菩薩即以此智印向彈擊之，彼佛菩薩便當隨喜而共加持。	001	Or there may be a bodhisattva who gives rise to an expansive mind and performs great buddha-works, but there are buddhas and bodhisattvas who abide in their own palaces and do not assist with their power. This bodhisattva then uses this wisdom seal to strike and shoot at them, and those buddhas and bodhisattvas will then rejoice and jointly empower him.

['ZH_T39_1798_001:0819c19_4']	又諸眾生恒為一切煩惱堅牢染縛，而不信受佛清淨法，爾時菩薩以此智印而擊射之，彼所堅縛即便破壞，以清淨法而用染之，一切眾生以是因緣開示悟入佛之知見，此即殺染而順淨也。	又諸眾生恒為一切煩惱堅牢染縛，而不信受佛清淨法，爾時菩薩以此智印而擊射之，彼所堅縛即便破壞，以清淨法而用染之，一切眾生以是因緣開示悟入佛之知見，此即殺染而順淨也。	001	Moreover, all sentient beings are always firmly bound by all afflictions and do not believe and accept the Buddha's pure Dharma. At that time, the bodhisattva uses this wisdom seal to strike and shoot them, and their firm bonds are immediately destroyed. Using the pure Dharma to dye them, all sentient beings, due to this cause and condition, open, reveal, understand, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and insight. This is killing the defiled and following the pure.
['ZH_T39_1798_001:0819c20_4']	是故如來以摩羅智於染於淨皆能染淨也。	是故如來以摩羅智於染於淨皆能染淨也。	001	Therefore, the Tathāgata uses the wisdom of Māra to be able to dye and purify both the defiled and the pure.
['ZH_T39_1798_001:0819c22_18']	又此次第者，謂入初普賢金剛三昧耶遍能觀察一切如來，遍能了知諸佛境界得不空智，爾時如來便以智印而用加持。	又此次第者，謂入初普賢金剛三昧耶遍能觀察一切如來，遍能了知諸佛境界得不空智，爾時如來便以智印而用加持。	001	Moreover, this sequence is as follows: Entering the initial Samantabhadra Vajra Samaya, one is able to observe all Tathāgatas everywhere and is able to understand and know the Buddha's realm. Attaining the wisdom of non-emptiness, at that time the Tathāgata then uses the wisdom seal to empower.
['ZH_T39_1798_001:0819c25_19']	得加持已，便能集會一切如來及諸如來無盡智藏，嚴自智界作大佛事，便能承事一切如來，而諸如來護念不捨，是以染智據次而說。	得加持已，便能集會一切如來及諸如來無盡智藏，嚴自智界作大佛事，便能承事一切如來，而諸如來護念不捨，是以染智據次而說。	001	Having attained empowerment, one is then able to assemble all tathāgatas and the inexhaustible wisdom treasury of the tathāgatas, adorn one's own wisdom realm, perform great buddha-works, and be able to serve all tathāgatas, while the tathāgatas protect and think of one without abandonment. Therefore, the wisdom of defilement is explained next.
['ZH_T39_1798_001:0819c27_17']	如是次第，皆是如來普賢金剛三昧智用一合實相甚深境界，以聲字相次故別轉耳。	如是次第，皆是如來普賢金剛三昧智用一合實相甚深境界，以聲字相次故別轉耳。	001	In this order, they are all the profound realm of the single reality of the wisdom and function of the tathāgata's universal vajra samādhi, which is turned separately only because of the succession of sounds and letters.
