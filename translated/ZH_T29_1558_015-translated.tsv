['ZH_T29_1558_015:0077c26_13', 'ZH_T29_1558_015:0077c27_13']	從二得者，謂從二類，即情非情、性罪遮罪。🔽從現得者，謂從現世蘊處界得，非從去來。	從二得者，謂從二類，即情非情、性罪遮罪。 從現得者，謂從現世蘊處界得，非從去來。	From two means from two types: sentient beings and non-sentient beings, natural offenses and prohibited offenses.🔽From present means one obtains them from the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the present, not from the past or future.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0077c28_13']	由此律儀有情處轉，去來非是有情處故。	由此律儀有情處轉，去來非是有情處故。	This is because these precepts arise from sentient beings and places, and the past and future are not sentient beings or places.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0077c29_13']	若得靜慮無漏律儀，應知但從根本業道。	若得靜慮無漏律儀，應知但從根本業道。	If one obtains the pure restraint of the dhyanas, one should know that it is only obtained from the fundamental karmic paths.

['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a02_12']	從恒時者，謂從過去現在未來蘊處界得。	從恒時者，謂從過去現在未來蘊處界得。	From the eternal time means that one obtains it from the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the past, present, and future.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a04_4']	由此差別應作四句，有蘊處界從彼唯得別解律儀非餘二等。	由此差別應作四句，有蘊處界從彼唯得別解律儀非餘二等。	By this distinction, one should make four statements. There are aggregates, sense bases, and elements from which one obtains only the restraint of individual liberation, not the other two, etc.

['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a08_16']	非於正得善律儀時可有現世惡業道等，是故應言從現處得。	非於正得善律儀時可有現世惡業道等，是故應言從現處得。	When one is obtaining the good restraint, one cannot have the present evil karmic paths, etc. Therefore, one should say that one obtains it from the present sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a09_16']	理應但說防護未來，定不應言防護過現。	理應但說防護未來，定不應言防護過現。	One should only say that one restrains the future, and it is definitely not said that one restrains the past and present.

['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a16_2']	支不定者，有從一切得，謂苾芻律儀。	支不定者，有從一切得，謂苾芻律儀。	As to parts being indefinite, some are obtained from all, namely the moral discipline of bhikṣus.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a17_6']	有從四支得，謂所餘律儀，唯根本業道名律儀支故。	有從四支得，謂所餘律儀，唯根本業道名律儀支故。	Some are obtained from four parts, namely the remaining moral disciplines, because only the fundamental karmic paths are called the parts of moral discipline.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a18_11']	因不定者，謂或有義從一切因，或約餘義唯許從一。	因不定者，謂或有義從一切因，或約餘義唯許從一。	As to causes being indefinite, it means that according to one interpretation, it is obtained from all causes, but according to another interpretation, it is only obtained from one.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a19_10']	從一切者，謂從無貪瞋癡，必俱起故。	從一切者，謂從無貪瞋癡，必俱起故。	As to being obtained from all, it means it is obtained from non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion, because they necessarily arise together.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a20_8']	唯從一者，謂從下中上心，不俱起故。	唯從一者，謂從下中上心，不俱起故。	As to being obtained from only one, it means it is obtained from the lower, middle, and upper minds, because they do not arise together.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a20_17', 'ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a23_5']	此中且就後三因說。🔽或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，非一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受近事勤策戒。	此中且就後三因說。 或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，非一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受近事勤策戒。	Here, we will explain this in terms of the latter three causes.🔽There is one type of person who abides in the precepts, who obtains the precepts in relation to all sentient beings, but not by all aspects and not by all causes, namely, those who, with a lesser, middling, or superior mind, receive the precepts of the lay devotee or novice monk.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a25_9', 'ZH_T29_1558_015:0078a27_14']	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受苾芻戒。🔽或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支及一切因，謂以三心受近事勤策苾芻戒。	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支非一切因，謂以下心或中或上受苾芻戒。 或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切支及一切因，謂以三心受近事勤策苾芻戒。	There is one type of person who abides in the precepts, who obtains the precepts in relation to all sentient beings, by all aspects but not by all causes, namely, those who, with a lesser, middling, or superior mind, receive the precepts of the fully ordained monk.🔽There is one type of person who abides in the precepts, who obtains the precepts in relation to all sentient beings, by all aspects and by all causes, namely, those who, with the three types of mind, receive the precepts of the lay devotee, novice monk, or fully ordained monk.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b01_1']	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切因非一切支，謂以三心受近事近住勤策戒。	或有一類住律儀者，於一切有情得律儀，由一切因非一切支，謂以三心受近事近住勤策戒。	There is one type of person who abides in the precepts, who obtains the precepts in relation to all sentient beings, by all causes but not by all aspects, namely, those who, with the three types of mind, receive the precepts of the lay devotee, the one-day upavāsa precepts, or the novice monk.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b03_11']	無有不遍於諸有情得律儀者，以於一切諸有情所住善意樂方得律儀，異則不然，以惡意樂不全息故。	無有不遍於諸有情得律儀者，以於一切諸有情所住善意樂方得律儀，異則不然，以惡意樂不全息故。	There is no one who does not universally obtain the precepts with regard to all sentient beings, because one only obtains the precepts by abiding in a good attitude toward all sentient beings, otherwise it is not so, because an evil attitude is not completely eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b05_1']	若人不作五種定限，方可受得別解律儀，謂有情、支、處、時、緣定。	若人不作五種定限，方可受得別解律儀，謂有情、支、處、時、緣定。	If a person does not make five kinds of fixed limits, then he can receive the precepts of individual liberation, namely, fixed limits with regard to sentient beings, members, places, times, and conditions.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b06_1']	有情定者，念我唯於某類有情當離殺等。	有情定者，念我唯於某類有情當離殺等。	Fixed limits with regard to sentient beings means thinking, I will only abstain from killing and so forth with regard to a certain class of sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b07_2']	言支定者，念我唯於某律儀支當持不犯。	言支定者，念我唯於某律儀支當持不犯。	Fixed limits with regard to members means thinking, I will only uphold and not violate a certain member of the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b08_3']	言處定者，念我唯住某類方域當離殺等。	言處定者，念我唯住某類方域當離殺等。	Fixed limits with regard to places means thinking, I will only abstain from killing and so forth while residing in a certain region.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b09_3']	言時定者，念我唯於一月等時能離殺等。	言時定者，念我唯於一月等時能離殺等。	Fixed limits with regard to times means thinking, I will only be able to abstain from killing and so forth for a month and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b10_3']	言緣定者，念我唯除鬪戰等緣能離殺等。	言緣定者，念我唯除鬪戰等緣能離殺等。	Fixed limits with regard to conditions means thinking, I will only abstain from killing and so forth except in the case of battle and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b11_3']	如是受者不得律儀，但得律儀相似妙行。	如是受者不得律儀，但得律儀相似妙行。	One who receives the precepts in this way does not obtain the precepts, but only precepts-like good conduct.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b11_15']	於非所能境，如何得律儀？	於非所能境，如何得律儀？	How can one obtain the precepts with regard to objects that are not able to be transgressed?
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b12_16']	由普於有情發起增上不損命意樂，故得律儀。	由普於有情發起增上不損命意樂，故得律儀。	Because one universally arouses the superior intention not to harm life with regard to sentient beings, one obtains the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b13_7']	毘婆沙師有作是說：	毘婆沙師有作是說：	There are Vaibhāṣikas who say:
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b16_15']	若謂一向於所能境方可受得別解律儀，則此律儀應有增減，以所能境與非所能二類有情有轉易故，如是便有別解律儀離得捨緣有得捨過。	若謂一向於所能境方可受得別解律儀，則此律儀應有增減，以所能境與非所能二類有情有轉易故，如是便有別解律儀離得捨緣有得捨過。	If one can only receive the prātimokṣa precepts with regard to objects that are able to be transgressed, then these precepts would have increase and decrease, because the two categories of sentient beings that are able to be transgressed and not able to be transgressed change. In this case, there would be the error of the prātimokṣa precepts being obtained and lost without causes for obtaining and losing them.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b17_3']	彼說不然。	彼說不然。	Their explanation is not correct.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b18_6']	如生草等先無後起或起已枯，於彼律儀無增無減。	如生草等先無後起或起已枯，於彼律儀無增無減。	Just as grass and so on that did not previously exist later arise, or having arisen wither, there is no increase or decrease in the precepts with regard to them.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b19_5']	能不能境所得律儀，境轉易時例亦應爾。	能不能境所得律儀，境轉易時例亦應爾。	The precepts obtained with regard to objects that are able to be transgressed and not able to be transgressed should be the same when the objects change.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b19_10']	彼言不爾。	彼言不爾。	They say this is not so.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b19_15']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it not so?
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b20_14']	以諸有情前後性等、草等前後性不同故。	以諸有情前後性等、草等前後性不同故。	Because the natures of sentient beings are the same before and after, while the natures of grass and so on are not the same before and after.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b22_4']	若爾，有情般涅槃已，如前性類今時既無，於彼律儀如何無減？	若爾，有情般涅槃已，如前性類今時既無，於彼律儀如何無減？	If this is so, then when sentient beings have already attained parinirvāṇa, since their previous nature and kind no longer exist, how can there be no reduction in the precepts for them?
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b22_14']	故如是釋，於理不然。	故如是釋，於理不然。	Therefore this explanation is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b23_4']	前所說因於理為善。	前所說因於理為善。	The previous explanation of the reason is good.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b25_3']	若爾，前佛及所度生已涅槃者，後佛於彼既不發得別解律儀，如何尸羅無減前過？	若爾，前佛及所度生已涅槃者，後佛於彼既不發得別解律儀，如何尸羅無減前過？	If this is so, then the previous Buddhas and those who have already attained parinirvāṇa, the later Buddhas have not attained the prātimokṣa precepts for them. How can there be no reduction in the precepts, as was the previous fault?
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b26_2']	以一切佛別解律儀，皆從一切有情處得。	以一切佛別解律儀，皆從一切有情處得。	Because the prātimokṣa precepts of all Buddhas are all attained from all sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b27_11']	設彼有情今猶在者，後佛從彼亦得律儀，故後尸羅無減前過。	設彼有情今猶在者，後佛從彼亦得律儀，故後尸羅無減前過。	Even if those sentient beings still exist now, the later Buddhas also attain the precepts from them. Therefore the later precepts have no reduction in comparison to the previous fault.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b28_2']	已說從彼得諸律儀。	已說從彼得諸律儀。	The attainment of various precepts has already been explained.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078b29_10']	得不律儀定從一切有情業道，無少分境及不具支不律儀者。	得不律儀定從一切有情業道，無少分境及不具支不律儀者。	The attainment of non-restraint is definitely from all sentient beings and karmic paths. There is no one who has a small portion of the realm or who does not have all the branches of non-restraint.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c01_9']	此定無有，由一切因下品等心無俱起故。	此定無有，由一切因下品等心無俱起故。	This definitely does not exist, because all causes and inferior minds, etc. do not arise together.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c04_1']	若有一類由下品心得不律儀，後於異時由上品心斷眾生命，彼但成就下不律儀，亦成殺生上品表等。	若有一類由下品心得不律儀，後於異時由上品心斷眾生命，彼但成就下不律儀，亦成殺生上品表等。	If a person of inferior mind acquires non-restraint, and later at another time kills living beings with an intense mind, he only accomplishes inferior non-restraint, and also accomplishes the manifestation of killing living beings in the superior category.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c04_10']	中品上品例此應知。	中品上品例此應知。	The middling and superior categories should be understood in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c06_13']	此中何名不律儀者，謂諸屠羊屠鷄屠猪捕鳥捕魚、獵獸劫盜魁膾典獄、縛龍煮狗及罝弶等。	此中何名不律儀者，謂諸屠羊屠鷄屠猪捕鳥捕魚、獵獸劫盜魁膾典獄、縛龍煮狗及罝弶等。	Here, what is called a non-restrained person? It refers to those who slaughter sheep, chickens, pigs, catch birds, fish, hunt beasts, rob, serve as executioners, prison guards, bind dragons, cook dogs, and set traps, etc.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c07_17']	等言類顯王典刑罰及餘聽察斷罪等人，但恒有害心。	等言類顯王典刑罰及餘聽察斷罪等人，但恒有害心。	The word etc. indicates kings who administer punishments and others who listen to and judge crimes, etc., who always have a harmful mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c08_14']	名不律儀者，由彼一類住不律儀。	名不律儀者，由彼一類住不律儀。	They are called non-restrained persons because they abide in non-restraint.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c10_8']	或有不律儀名不律儀者，言屠羊者，謂為活命要期盡壽恒欲害羊。	或有不律儀名不律儀者，言屠羊者，謂為活命要期盡壽恒欲害羊。	Or there are those who are called non-restrained persons but are not non-restraint. As for those who slaughter sheep, it means that for the sake of livelihood, they vow to always wish to harm sheep for their entire lives.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c11_1']	餘隨所應當知亦爾。	餘隨所應當知亦爾。	The rest should be understood in the same way according to the circumstances.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c15_4']	遍於有情界得諸律儀，其理可爾，由普欲利樂勝阿世耶而受得故，非屠羊等不律儀人於己至親有損害意，乃至為救自身命緣亦不欲殺，如何可說普於一切得不律儀？	遍於有情界得諸律儀，其理可爾，由普欲利樂勝阿世耶而受得故，非屠羊等不律儀人於己至親有損害意，乃至為救自身命緣亦不欲殺，如何可說普於一切得不律儀？	It is reasonable that one obtains all the restraints in the realm of sentient beings, because one obtains them through the superior intention of universally wishing to benefit and bring happiness to sentient beings. But for those who are not restrained, such as butchers of sheep, they do not have the intention to harm their own close relatives, and they do not wish to kill even if it is to save their own lives. How can it be said that they universally obtain non-restraint?
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c16_4']	由彼至親若為羊等，於彼亦可有損害心。	由彼至親若為羊等，於彼亦可有損害心。	Because if their close relatives were to become sheep, they would also have the intention to harm them.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c17_4']	既知至親現非羊等，如何於彼可有害心？	既知至親現非羊等，如何於彼可有害心？	Since they know that their close relatives are not currently sheep, how can they have the intention to harm them?
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c18_4']	又聖必無作羊等理，如何於彼得不律儀？	又聖必無作羊等理，如何於彼得不律儀？	Moreover, it is impossible for the noble ones to become sheep, so how can they obtain non-restraint towards them?
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c19_4']	若觀未來羊等自體，於現相續得不律儀。	若觀未來羊等自體，於現相續得不律儀。	If one obtains non-restraint in the present continuum by observing the future body of a sheep,
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c20_13']	是則羊等於未來世，亦有至親及聖自體，於彼決定無損害心。	是則羊等於未來世，亦有至親及聖自體，於彼決定無損害心。	then in the future, sheep will also have close relatives and the bodies of noble ones, and they will definitely have no intention to harm them.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c21_13']	是則應觀未來自體，不於現在得不律儀。	是則應觀未來自體，不於現在得不律儀。	Then one should observe one's own future body, and not obtain non-restraint in the present.
['ZH_T29_1558_015:0078c22_15']	於羊等現身既有害意，如何不於彼得不律儀？	於羊等現身既有害意，如何不於彼得不律儀？	Since you have the intention to harm sheep and so on in the present life, why don't you obtain non-restraint with respect to them?
