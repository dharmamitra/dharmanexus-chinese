['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651a28_5']	以定中唯有根本業道故。	以定中唯有根本業道故。	015	Because in concentration there are only the fundamental karmic paths.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651a28_14']	非從前後近分而得。	非從前後近分而得。	015	They are not obtained from the proximate parts before and after.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651a29_5']	以在定位唯有根本。	以在定位唯有根本。	015	Because in the concentrated state there are only the fundamental [precepts],
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b01_2']	在不定位中無此律儀故解云。	在不定位中無此律儀故解云。	015	and in the unconcentrated state there are no such precepts. The commentary says:
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b01_14']	此由六禪地中靜慮及無漏。	此由六禪地中靜慮及無漏。	015	This is due to the dhyāna and undefiled [precepts] in the six dhyāna stages.

['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b01_49']	惡戒既唯根本七支　此亦唯根本業道。	惡戒既唯根本七支　此亦唯根本業道。	015	Since evil conduct only has the seven fundamental branches, this [dhyāna and undefiled precepts] also only has the fundamental karmic paths.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b02_8']	散心非彼斷等對治。	散心非彼斷等對治。	015	The scattered mind is not the antidote that eliminates them.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b02_17']	由斯無有此類律儀。	由斯無有此類律儀。	015	Therefore, there is no such type of restraint.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b02_27']	非如別解脫從別緣制。	非如別解脫從別緣制。	015	It is not like the prātimokṣa, which is established from separate conditions.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b02_29']	論。	論。	015	The treatise says:
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b03_5']	從恒時者至蘊處界得。	從恒時者至蘊處界得。	015	From the eternal time, up to obtaining the aggregates, sense bases, and elements.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b03_15']	釋第五節　正理論云。	釋第五節　正理論云。	015	The fifth section is explained in the Nyāyānusāra Śāstra:
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b04_1']	從恒時者。	從恒時者。	015	From the eternal time means
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b04_19']	謂從過去．現在．未來．蘊．處．界得。	謂從過去．現在．未來．蘊．處．界得。	015	from the past, present, and future aggregates, sense bases, and elements one obtains.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b05_8']	如與此戒為共有心解云。	如與此戒為共有心解云。	015	As with the mind that accompanies this precept, it is explained.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b05_18']	既心緣三世斷彼惡戒。	既心緣三世斷彼惡戒。	015	Since the mind contemplates the three time periods and severs those evil precepts,
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b06_3']	所得律儀亦於彼處發　太法師云。	所得律儀亦於彼處發　太法師云。	015	the restraint that is obtained is also produced in those places. The great master of the Dharma says:
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b06_8']	理實而言。	理實而言。	015	In reality,
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b07_6']	過去蘊．處．界自發過去定．道心俱戒。	過去蘊．處．界自發過去定．道心俱戒。	015	the past aggregates, sense bases, and elements themselves produce the precepts that accompany the mind of past concentration and path.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b08_3']	現在蘊．界．處自發現在定．道心俱戒。	現在蘊．界．處自發現在定．道心俱戒。	015	The present aggregates, sense bases, and elements themselves produce the precepts that accompany the present mind of concentration and path.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b09_1']	未來蘊．處．界自發未來定．道心俱戒。	未來蘊．處．界自發未來定．道心俱戒。	015	The future aggregates, sense bases, and elements themselves produce the precepts that accompany the future mind of concentration and path.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b09_12']	以戒從現在有情處得故。	以戒從現在有情處得故。	015	Because the precepts are obtained from the present sentient beings and places.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b10_12']	三世各別發　以定．道心通三世一時得。	三世各別發　以定．道心通三世一時得。	015	The precepts of the three times are obtained separately, while the precepts of concentration and the path are obtained simultaneously in the three times.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b11_3']	故戒亦三世一時得。	故戒亦三世一時得。	015	Therefore, the precepts are also obtained in the three times and simultaneously.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b11_15']	故言從三世蘊．處．界得。	故言從三世蘊．處．界得。	015	Therefore, it is said that they are obtained from the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the three times.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b11_20']	故正理論。	故正理論。	015	Therefore, the Nyāyapraveśa states:
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b12_5']	云從恒時者。	云從恒時者。	015	From the eternal means
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b13_1']	謂從過去．未來．現在蘊．處．界得。	謂從過去．未來．現在蘊．處．界得。	015	from the aggregates, sense bases, and elements of the past, future, and present,
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b13_10']	如與此戒為俱有心。	如與此戒為俱有心。	015	just like the mind that exists simultaneously with these precepts.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b14_7']	法師此釋誤也　若如法師此釋。	法師此釋誤也　若如法師此釋。	015	The Dharma Master's explanation is mistaken. If it were as the Dharma Master explains,
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b14_13']	即是得恒時。	即是得恒時。	015	then it would be the attainment of the eternal,
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b14_19']	非是恒時得。	非是恒時得。	015	not the eternal attainment.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b15_6']	即與共有心別。	即與共有心別。	015	It would be separate from the mind that exists simultaneously.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b16_10']	如何論云如俱有心　又云以戒現在有情處得故。	如何論云如俱有心　又云以戒現在有情處得故。	015	How can the treatise say it is like the mind that exists simultaneously? It also says that because the precepts are obtained in the present realm of sentient beings,
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b17_3']	若爾與別解律儀何別。	若爾與別解律儀何別。	015	then how are they different from the precepts of individual liberation?

['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b17_16']	由此差別至加行．後起。	由此差別至加行．後起。	015	By this distinction, the preparatory and subsequent actions,
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b18_4']	已下四句分別。	已下四句分別。	015	are distinguished in the following four sentences.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b18_18']	第一句是得別解律儀非定．道。	第一句是得別解律儀非定．道。	015	The first sentence refers to obtaining the precepts of individual liberation, but not those of concentration and the path.
['ZH_T41_1822_015:0651b19_11']	第二句是得定．道非別解。	第二句是得定．道非別解。	015	The second phrase refers to those who attain concentration and the path but not the prātimokṣa.
