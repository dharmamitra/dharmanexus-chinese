It has already been explained that there are many distinctions in the stages of learners, such as the fruit of stream-entry, etc. Are there also many kinds of distinctions in the characteristics of arhats?

['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b13_1']	於契經中說阿羅漢，由種性異故有住種：	於契經中說阿羅漢，由種性異故有住種：	In the sutras, it is said that arhats, due to differences in their natures, are of different types:
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b14_11']	一者退法、二者思法、三者護法、四安住法、五堪達法、六不動法。	一者退法、二者思法、三者護法、四安住法、五堪達法、六不動法。	1) those who regress, 2) those who contemplate, 3) those who guard, 4) those who are firmly established, 5) those who can penetrate, and 6) those who are unshakable.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b15_9']	然餘經說無學有九，謂初退法，後俱解脫。	然餘經說無學有九，謂初退法，後俱解脫。	However, other sutras say that there are nine types of adepts, namely those who regress at first, up to those who are liberated both ways.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b15_19']	彼不退法，此不動攝。	彼不退法，此不動攝。	Those who do not regress are included in those who are unshakable.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b17_1']	彼二解脫通此六攝，故阿毘達磨唯說有六種。	彼二解脫通此六攝，故阿毘達磨唯說有六種。	The two kinds of liberation are included in these six kinds, and therefore the Abhidharma teaches that there are only six kinds.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b18_17']	言退法者，謂彼獲得如是類根，安住此根，與退緣會便退所得，無退緣者便般涅槃。	言退法者，謂彼獲得如是類根，安住此根，與退緣會便退所得，無退緣者便般涅槃。	The first kind, those who regress, are those who obtain this kind of faculty and abide in this faculty. When they encounter conditions for regression, they regress from what they have obtained. Those who do not encounter conditions for regression attain parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b19_16']	或有精勤進得勝性，遇緣多退故名退法。	或有精勤進得勝性，遇緣多退故名退法。	Or there are those who diligently progress and attain a superior nature, but often regress due to encountering conditions. They are called those who regress.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b22_6']	言思法者，謂有獲得如是類根，安住此根，念力堅固多住厭觀，恐失勝德，為自勵心多思害己，故名思法。	言思法者，謂有獲得如是類根，安住此根，念力堅固多住厭觀，恐失勝德，為自勵心多思害己，故名思法。	The second kind, those who are mindful, are those who obtain this kind of faculty and abide in this faculty. With the power of mindfulness firm, they often abide in the contemplation of disgust, fearing to lose their excellent qualities. They often think of harming themselves in order to encourage their minds. Therefore they are called those who are mindful.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b24_4']	言護法者，謂有一類恒於時愛心解脫中繫念現前，專精防護不放逸住，故名護法。	言護法者，謂有一類恒於時愛心解脫中繫念現前，專精防護不放逸住，故名護法。	The third kind, those who guard, are those who always in the mind liberation of loving-kindness fix their mindfulness on the present, diligently guarding and not being negligent in abiding. Therefore they are called those who guard.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b26_4']	安住法者，謂離勝退緣，雖不自防而亦能不退，離勝加行亦不練根，多住處中，故名安住。	安住法者，謂離勝退緣，雖不自防而亦能不退，離勝加行亦不練根，多住處中，故名安住。	Those who are steadfast are those who are free from conditions that cause them to fall away from the superior stage. Even if they do not protect themselves, they are still able to not retrogress. They are also free from superior practice and do not cultivate the faculties. They often abide in the middle. Therefore, they are called steadfast.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b27_12']	堪達法者，謂性堪能好修練根，速達不動能親證利，故名堪達。	堪達法者，謂性堪能好修練根，速達不動能親證利，故名堪達。	Those who are capable of penetrating insight are those who are by nature capable and good at cultivating the faculties. They quickly reach the stage of non-retrogression and are able to personally realize the benefits. Therefore, they are called capable of penetrating insight.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935b29_11']	不動法者，謂有一類根性殊勝志不怯弱，所獲功德遇勝退緣亦必不退，故名不動。	不動法者，謂有一類根性殊勝志不怯弱，所獲功德遇勝退緣亦必不退，故名不動。	Those who are unshakable are those who have a superior nature and a resolute will that is not weak. The merits they have attained will certainly not retrogress even if they encounter superior conditions for falling away. Therefore, they are called unshakable.

['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c04_11']	此六異相謂六種性，先學位中初二，闕恒時及尊重加行，然至無學，思法小勤，護法唯有恒時加行，安住唯有尊重加行，堪達具二而是鈍根，不動具二而是利根。	此六異相謂六種性，先學位中初二，闕恒時及尊重加行，然至無學，思法小勤，護法唯有恒時加行，安住唯有尊重加行，堪達具二而是鈍根，不動具二而是利根。	The six different characteristics are the six types of natures. In the stage of learning, the first two lack both constant time and respectful practice. However, when they reach the stage of no more learning, the contemplating nature has a little effort. The protecting nature only has the practice of constant time. The steadfast nature only has respectful practice. Those capable of penetrating insight have both but are of dull faculties. The unshakable nature has both but is of sharp faculties.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c04_16']	有作是言：	有作是言：	There are those who say:
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c05_10']	退法必退，乃至堪達必達不動。	退法必退，乃至堪達必達不動。	Those liable to retrogress definitely retrogress, and those capable of penetrating insight definitely penetrate insight.

['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c08_2']	彼執欲界具足有六，色無色界中唯安住、不動，彼無退失、自害、自防及修練根，故唯有二。	彼執欲界具足有六，色無色界中唯安住、不動，彼無退失、自害、自防及修練根，故唯有二。	They hold that the desire realm is endowed with all six, and the form and formless realms have only the abiders and the unshakable. They do not retrogress, harm themselves, guard themselves, or cultivate the refinement of faculties. Therefore, they have only two.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c10_14']	理實無定然退應果，唯從先來退種性退，乃至得不動，唯堪達所能，立退等名，約容有說，故六阿羅漢通三界皆有。	理實無定然退應果，唯從先來退種性退，乃至得不動，唯堪達所能，立退等名，約容有說，故六阿羅漢通三界皆有。	In reality, there is no fixed rule. However, those who retrogress and attain the fruit definitely retrogress from the original type of retrogresser, and so on. Up to those who are unshakable are only capable of penetrating insight. The names of retrogressers, etc., are established based on the possibility of retrogressing, etc. Therefore, the six arhats are all present in the three realms.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c12_5']	六中前五從信解生，即此總名時愛心解脫，以一切時愛心解脫故。	六中前五從信解生，即此總名時愛心解脫，以一切時愛心解脫故。	Among the six, the first five are born from faith and understanding. They are collectively called temporal liberation of the mind through affection, because they are liberated through affection at all times.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c13_15']	亦說名為時解脫者，謂待時處補特伽羅，資具等合時方得解脫故。	亦說名為時解脫者，謂待時處補特伽羅，資具等合時方得解脫故。	They are also called those liberated at times, because they are liberated when the time, place, person, and requisites, etc., come together.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c14_14']	以所依止功能薄劣，要待勝時方解脫故。	以所依止功能薄劣，要待勝時方解脫故。	Because the power of their support is weak, they are liberated only when they encounter superior conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c15_14']	或復一切勝定現前要待勝時，是此時義。	或復一切勝定現前要待勝時，是此時義。	Or else, the meaning of time is that all superior samādhis must appear in dependence on superior times.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c16_4']	離繫縛故名為解脫。	離繫縛故名為解脫。	It is called liberation because it is free from bonds.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c17_4']	此即待時及解脫義，略初言故，如言酥瓶。	此即待時及解脫義，略初言故，如言酥瓶。	This is the meaning of time and liberation, but the initial words are omitted, just as one says “curd-butter.”
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c18_15']	不動法性說名為後，即此名為不動心解脫，彼心解脫非惑所動故。	不動法性說名為後，即此名為不動心解脫，彼心解脫非惑所動故。	The nature of the immovable is called later, and it is also called the mind liberation of the immovable, because that mind liberation is not moved by passions.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c19_14']	亦說名為不時解脫，以不待時得解脫故。	亦說名為不時解脫，以不待時得解脫故。	It is also called liberation not dependent on time, because it obtains liberation without regard to time.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c21_2']	或復勝定隨處隨時隨所遇緣隨欲便起，離繫縛故名為解脫。	或復勝定隨處隨時隨所遇緣隨欲便起，離繫縛故名為解脫。	Or else, a superior samādhi is produced in dependence on place, time, and the conditions encountered, and it is called liberation because it is free from bonds.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c21_11']	即不待時及解脫義。	即不待時及解脫義。	This is the meaning of not dependent on time and liberation.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c22_1', 'ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c23_1']	有餘釋此二差別言：🔽以於暫時得解脫故，名時解脫，後容退故。	有餘釋此二差別言： 以於暫時得解脫故，名時解脫，後容退故。	Other masters interpret the difference between the two as follows:🔽One is called liberation dependent on time because one obtains liberation only at a certain time, because one may retrogress later.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0935c24_11']	以能畢竟得解脫故，名不時解脫，後無容退故，此從前位見至性生。	以能畢竟得解脫故，名不時解脫，後無容退故，此從前位見至性生。	One is called liberation not dependent on time because one obtains liberation forever, because one does not retrogress later. It is born from the former state of the nature of one who has insight into the truths.

['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a01_17']	謂有先來是思法性，乃至不動有先退法，練根成思至不動等，多種差別如理應思。	謂有先來是思法性，乃至不動有先退法，練根成思至不動等，多種差別如理應思。	This means that there are those who are of the type that contemplates from the beginning, up to the immovable. There are those who regress from the beginning, and through cultivation of the faculties become the type that contemplates, up to the immovable, etc. There are many distinctions that should be considered according to reason.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a03_2']	如是六種阿羅漢中，唯前五種容有退義，誰從何退？	如是六種阿羅漢中，唯前五種容有退義，誰從何退？	Among these six kinds of arhats, only the first five have the meaning of regression. From what do they regress?

['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a06_1']	不動種性必無退理，故唯前五容有退義。	不動種性必無退理，故唯前五容有退義。	The immovable type definitely has no principle of regression. Therefore only the first five have the meaning of regression.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a07_8']	於中後四有退種性，退法一種無退性理，由此種性最居下故。	於中後四有退種性，退法一種無退性理，由此種性最居下故。	The last four have the possibility of degeneration of their spiritual genes, but the first has no possibility of degeneration of its spiritual genes, because it is the lowest.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a09_17']	五種皆有從果退理，雖俱有退然並非先，謂無學位中從退法種性修練根行轉成思等，此四皆有退性果義。	五種皆有從果退理，雖俱有退然並非先，謂無學位中從退法種性修練根行轉成思等，此四皆有退性果義。	All five have the possibility of degeneration of their fruits. Although they all have the possibility of degeneration, none of them is a prior degenerate. That is, in the state of post-learner, one who is of the spiritual gene of the degenerate type cultivates the practice of sharpening the faculties and transforms into the type that contemplates characteristics, etc. These four all have the possibility of degeneration of their spiritual genes and fruits.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a10_16']	退法種性雖必先得而是退法，故容退果。	退法種性雖必先得而是退法，故容退果。	Although one of the degenerate type necessarily first acquires the fruit, he is still of the degenerate type. Therefore, he can degenerate from his fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a12_6', 'ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a13_17']	諸學位中從退法性修練根行，轉成思等及得學果，皆容退失。🔽諸無學者先學位中所住種性，彼從此性必無退理，學無學道所成堅故。	諸學位中從退法性修練根行，轉成思等及得學果，皆容退失。 諸無學者先學位中所住種性，彼從此性必無退理，學無學道所成堅故。	In the state of learner, one who is of the degenerate type cultivates the practice of sharpening the faculties and transforms into the type that contemplates characteristics, etc., and acquires the fruit of learner. All of these are possible.🔽In the state of post-learner, the spiritual gene in which one abides is definitely not subject to degeneration. This is because it is firm, being perfected by the paths of learner and post-learner.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a15_11']	諸有學者先凡位中所住種性，彼從此性亦無退理，世出世道所成堅故。	諸有學者先凡位中所住種性，彼從此性亦無退理，世出世道所成堅故。	In the state of learner, the spiritual gene in which one abides in the state of ordinary beings is also not subject to degeneration. This is because it is firm, being perfected by mundane and supramundane paths.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a16_19']	二先位中住思等性必無有退，此所得果、此性二道所成堅故。	二先位中住思等性必無有退，此所得果、此性二道所成堅故。	In the first two stages, the nature of the state of thought and so on is definitely not subject to falling away, because the fruit obtained in these two stages is accomplished by the two paths of thought and nature and is firm.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a19_9']	彼從思等修練根行轉得護等，雖可退性轉所得性，進得學果亦有退義，由此種性非二道成，不堅牢故。	彼從思等修練根行轉得護等，雖可退性轉所得性，進得學果亦有退義，由此種性非二道成，不堅牢故。	From thought and so on, one cultivates the practice of sharpening the faculties and transforms to obtain the nature of the state of protection and so on. Although one may fall away from the nature of thought and so on, one transforms and obtains the nature of the state of protection and so on. Even if one advances and obtains the fruit of the state of learning, there is still the meaning of falling away. Because this nature is not accomplished by the two paths of thought and nature, it is not firm.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a20_17']	若就四果辯退果義，雖五種性皆可退果，而先所得必無有退。	若就四果辯退果義，雖五種性皆可退果，而先所得必無有退。	If one discusses the meaning of falling away from the fruit in terms of the four fruits, although the five natures are all subject to falling away from the fruit, that which is obtained first is definitely not subject to falling away.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a23_5']	謂四果中先所得者，即預流等前三隨一，從此先果必無退義，是斷見惑所得果故，聖斷見惑必無退故。	謂四果中先所得者，即預流等前三隨一，從此先果必無退義，是斷見惑所得果故，聖斷見惑必無退故。	That is, that which is obtained first among the four fruits is one of the first three fruits, such as the fruit of the stream-enterer. From this first fruit, there is definitely no meaning of falling away, because it is the fruit obtained by eliminating the passions that are to be eliminated by the path of insight. Because the noble one who has eliminated the passions to be eliminated by the path of insight definitely does not fall away.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a23_14']	何緣見惑聖斷無退？	何緣見惑聖斷無退？	Why is it that the noble one does not fall away from the elimination of the passions to be eliminated by the path of insight?
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a24_4']	以彼不緣所執事故。	以彼不緣所執事故。	Because they do not take as their object the thing that is grasped.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a25_14']	謂見所斷煩惱現行，無不皆由我見勢力，以彼煩惱起我見為根故。	謂見所斷煩惱現行，無不皆由我見勢力，以彼煩惱起我見為根故。	That is, the actual dharmas that are eliminated by the path of insight are all due to the power of the view of the transitory aggregates, because those passions arise with the view of the transitory aggregates as their root.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936a26_13']	由此見惑不緣所執，以所執事都無體故。	由此見惑不緣所執，以所執事都無體故。	Therefore the views do not take the imagined as an object, because the imagined thing is totally nonexistent.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936b01_10']	然有所緣諦為境故，彼所執事都無種子，於所緣境極乖違故，聖者相續真無我解恒所隨故，雖暫失念而必無容重執有我，以見所斷依我事生，故聖斷已必無退義。	然有所緣諦為境故，彼所執事都無種子，於所緣境極乖違故，聖者相續真無我解恒所隨故，雖暫失念而必無容重執有我，以見所斷依我事生，故聖斷已必無退義。	However, they do have objects, because they take the four truths as objects. The imagined thing is totally nonexistent, because it is in total contradiction to the object that is its object. Also, because the true understanding of nonself in the holy path of insight always accompanies the holy disciple, even though he may temporarily lose his mindfulness, he certainly will not again grasp a self, because the passions that are eliminated by the path of insight arise in dependence on the thing that is the self. Therefore, when the holy disciple has eliminated them, he certainly does not retrogress.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936b04_15']	修所斷惑雖顛倒轉，而非無種有所執事，謂於色等染著憎背高舉不了行相轉時，於色等中非無少分淨妙怨害高下甚深，故非境中極乖違轉。	修所斷惑雖顛倒轉，而非無種有所執事，謂於色等染著憎背高舉不了行相轉時，於色等中非無少分淨妙怨害高下甚深，故非境中極乖違轉。	Even though the passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation are inverted, they are not without a seed and an imagined thing as an object. That is, when the modes of activity of attachment, hatred, pride, and ignorance with regard to form, etc., occur, there is a certain amount of purity, enmity, exaltation, and profundity in form, etc., and therefore they do not totally contradict their objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0936b05_16']	由此聖者有時失念，執淨妙等相退起修斷惑。	由此聖者有時失念，執淨妙等相退起修斷惑。	Consequently, the holy disciple sometimes loses his mindfulness and retrogresses and generates the passions that are eliminated by the path of cultivation, grasping such characteristics as purity.

['ZH_T29_1563_033:0940a27_9']	任運轉者，由此地中止觀雙行無增減故。	任運轉者，由此地中止觀雙行無增減故。	Proceeding spontaneously means that in these stages, the two contemplations of cessation and contemplation proceed together without increase or decrease.

Although the path is not painful, it is called painful because it proceeds with difficulty, associated with the feeling of pain, like riding a horse on land.
['ZH_T29_1563_033:0940b03_14']	由此地中止觀雖俱而增減故，謂無色地觀減止增，未至中間觀增止減。	由此地中止觀雖俱而增減故，謂無色地觀減止增，未至中間觀增止減。	Therefore, in the stage of meditative tranquility, although both are present, they increase and decrease. This means that in the stage of formlessness, tranquility increases and meditative observation decreases, while in the preliminary stage and intermediate stage, meditative observation increases and tranquility decreases.
