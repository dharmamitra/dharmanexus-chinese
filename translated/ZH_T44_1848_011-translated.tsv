['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353b23_17']	疏為因是業義者。	疏為因是業義者。	011	The commentary states being a cause is the meaning of karma.
['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353b24_7']	然九中前八皆得名因。	然九中前八皆得名因。	011	Among the nine, the first eight are all called causes.
['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353b24_14']	所以不言業者。	所以不言業者。	011	The reason it does not say karma is
['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353b25_1']	亦約別義故。	亦約別義故。	011	also because it is based on specific meanings.
['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353b25_10']	今此初相能為苦本。	今此初相能為苦本。	011	This initial characteristic is able to be the root of suffering.

['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353b28_1']	以一念起動即具微細四相。	以一念起動即具微細四相。	011	Because a single thought of movement is endowed with the subtle four characteristics.
['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353b28_14']	四相之苦果不離一念之動因。	四相之苦果不離一念之動因。	011	The suffering of the four characteristics does not depart from the moving cause of a single thought.

['ZH_T44_1848_011:0353c06_11']	未有轉現心境差別故。	未有轉現心境差別故。	011	There is no yet differentiation of the mind and objects of transformation and manifestation, therefore
