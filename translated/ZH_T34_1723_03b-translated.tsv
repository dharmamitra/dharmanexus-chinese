This must have a cause. It further explains the meaning of entry, so the treatise says, The entry is manifested as the stage of nonretrogression and the immeasurable wisdom-karma.
['ZH_T34_1723_03b:0712b14_13']	佛出於世欲令三乘有情皆修不退地業，安住祕密藏、入大涅槃，不為餘也。	佛出於世欲令三乘有情皆修不退地業，安住祕密藏、入大涅槃，不為餘也。	03b	The Buddha appears in the world, wishing to cause the beings of the three vehicles to all cultivate the karma of the stage of nonretrogression, abide in the secret treasury, and enter great parinirvāṇa, not for anything else.
['ZH_T34_1723_03b:0712b16_3']	此與涅槃名字雖殊、體性無別，一切皆欲行因證入佛果位故。	此與涅槃名字雖殊、體性無別，一切皆欲行因證入佛果位故。	03b	This and parinirvāṇa, although the names differ, the essence is no different. It is because all wish to practice the causes and realize entry into the Buddha's fruition stage.

The essence and virtue of the One Vehicle are said to be the great parinirvāṇa. The two bodies of Dharma and reward, the correct enlightenment and the perfect cessation, each one comprehensively includes and is complete. What principle is there that cannot be applied?

The fruit is outstanding and the cause is opened, and there is no contradiction.

It actually includes both kinds, and the meaning is completely encompassed.

Although the vehicle of the cause of Buddhahood is common to the three incalculable eons, here it is taken only after the second eon, because the treatise says that it causes one to realize the stage of nonretrogression, and because the Laṅkâvatāra Sūtra divides the ten stages into three kinds of bodies born of mind. This is explained in a separate chapter.
