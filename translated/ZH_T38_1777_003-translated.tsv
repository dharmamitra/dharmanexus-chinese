['ZH_T38_1777_003:0533c05_4']	一、四宗名義，言方似滯者，彼不依四不可說，用四悉檀說，則成滯也。	一、四宗名義，言方似滯者，彼不依四不可說，用四悉檀說，則成滯也。	003	First, as for the names and meanings of the Four Doctrines seeming to be stuck in words, they do not rely on the four inexpressibles, but use the four siddhāntas to speak, which then becomes stuck.
['ZH_T38_1777_003:0533c07_19']	二、細尋研覈名義，似如不便者，彼之四宗，《毘曇》明見有得通，可許因緣為宗，三假是世諦，見世諦未得道，何得以假名為宗？	二、細尋研覈名義，似如不便者，彼之四宗，《毘曇》明見有得通，可許因緣為宗，三假是世諦，見世諦未得道，何得以假名為宗？	003	Second, if we carefully examine and investigate the names and meanings, it seems inconvenient. In their four schools, the Abhidharma clarifies that seeing has attainment and penetration, so it can be allowed that conditioned arising is the main principle. The three provisional posits are the conventional truth. Seeing the conventional truth is not yet attaining the Way. How can the provisional name be taken as the main principle?

['ZH_T38_1777_003:0533c11_19']	又，《大智論》彈方廣人取十諭，說一切法不生不滅，失般若意，豈得幻化為不真宗也。	又，《大智論》彈方廣人取十諭，說一切法不生不滅，失般若意，豈得幻化為不真宗也。	003	Furthermore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra criticizes the Vaipulya practitioners for taking the ten parables to say that all dharmas are non-arising and non-ceasing, losing the meaning of prajñā. How can illusion and transformation be taken as the main principle of the unreal?

Now, selecting from various sūtras and treatises, I establish the meaning of the four teachings. Each teaching has four gates. The four teachings together have sixteen gates, which are the sixteen tenets that clarify the meaning.
