['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a06_1']	若修觀者，凡夫直用如來淨禪。	若修觀者，凡夫直用如來淨禪。	If one cultivates contemplation, ordinary beings directly use the pure meditation of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a07_2']	」今此文中，即以第三同於第四，不同初二。	」今此文中，即以第三同於第四，不同初二。	In this text, the third is the same as the fourth, not the same as the first two.
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a07_17']	初二是凡小，二猶未亡法無我故。	初二是凡小，二猶未亡法無我故。	The first two are ordinary beings and the lesser vehicle, and the second has not yet eliminated the selflessness of phenomena.
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a09_12']	即以三四因果交徹，謂見佛法界即緣如義，無取無入即同如來清淨禪義。	即以三四因果交徹，謂見佛法界即緣如義，無取無入即同如來清淨禪義。	The third and fourth mutually penetrate cause and effect, that is, seeing the Dharma realm of the Buddha is taking suchness as an object, without grasping and without entering, which is the same as the meaning of the pure meditation of the Tathāgata.

['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a14_6']	言「非實非妄即是不常」者，常有二義：	言「非實非妄即是不常」者，常有二義：	Neither real nor false is precisely not permanent means that permanence has two meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a15_7']	一虛妄計度生死有常，今云非妄，即非常矣。	一虛妄計度生死有常，今云非妄，即非常矣。	First, falsely imagining that birth and death are permanent. Now saying not false means it is not permanent.
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a16_7']	二者出世實法名常，今云非實，亦無常矣。	二者出世實法名常，今云非實，亦無常矣。	Second, supramundane real dharmas are called permanent. Now saying not real also means it is not permanent.
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a17_1']	「諸法實相中，無實無非實」故。	「諸法實相中，無實無非實」故。	In the true reality of all dharmas, there is neither reality nor unreality.
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a17_18']	「非遷非壞即是不斷」者，斷亦有二：	「非遷非壞即是不斷」者，斷亦有二：	Neither changing nor decaying is precisely not severed means severance also has two aspects:
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a18_16']	一世法遷移即有斷滅、二滅壞煩惱成於斷德。	一世法遷移即有斷滅、二滅壞煩惱成於斷德。	First, worldly dharmas change and move, so they are severed and extinguished. Second, severing and destroying afflictions results in the virtue of severance.
['ZH_T36_1736_088:0682a19_8']	今並非之，故不斷也。	今並非之，故不斷也。	Now, since they are all not so, they are not eliminated.

Therefore, form and emptiness are unobstructed, and existence, nonexistence, concealment, and manifestation are all freely mastered. Only then can one manifest various forms according to one's wishes. Therefore, it first clarifies the inner accord with reality.

How can there be inequality when myriad dharmas are one?

['ZH_T36_1736_088:0684b13_13']	又若以色為色，不能現色；	又若以色為色，不能現色；	Moreover, if form is taken as form, it cannot manifest form;

['ZH_T36_1736_088:0684b18_16']	「起信等論明八地當色自在」者，《起信》云「四者現色不相應染，依色自在地能離故。	「起信等論明八地當色自在」者，《起信》云「四者現色不相應染，依色自在地能離故。	The Awakening of Faith and other treatises clarify that the eighth ground corresponds to mastery over form - the Awakening of Faith says fourth, the defilement of the non-association with the manifestation of form, based on the ground of mastery over form one is able to be free from it.
