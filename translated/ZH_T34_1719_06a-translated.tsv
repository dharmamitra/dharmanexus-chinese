This should only be eighty in terms of form, because worldly beings serve the eighty kinds of spirits, so the Buddha possesses them to give rise to respect and reverence.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a11_3']	今經文意總言敘昔失耳。	今經文意總言敘昔失耳。	06a	The meaning of the current sutra text is to generally speak of describing past mistakes.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a12_16']	然八十好各具四悉以利於他，不必全為八十神也，故一一好無非好海。	然八十好各具四悉以利於他，不必全為八十神也，故一一好無非好海。	06a	However, each of the eighty excellent characteristics possesses the four siddhāntas to benefit others, it is not necessarily entirely for the eighty kinds of spirits, therefore each excellent characteristic is none other than an ocean of excellent characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a14_1']	今聞開權正領昔失，不思議好具如下調達中。	今聞開權正領昔失，不思議好具如下調達中。	06a	Now hearing the disclosure of the provisional, it correctly leads to past mistakes, the inconceivable excellent characteristics are as explained below in the chapter on Devadatta.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a15_15']	言「我嘗於日夜等」者，若諸聖者還以昏曉而為昏夜，於此思惟，何足可述？	言「我嘗於日夜等」者，若諸聖者還以昏曉而為昏夜，於此思惟，何足可述？	06a	As for the phrase I have always during the day and night, etc., if the sages were to still think of dusk and dawn as dusk and night, what is the point of mentioning this?
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a16_5']	是故此中應從所表。	是故此中應從所表。	06a	Therefore, in this context, one should follow what is being indicated.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a17_14']	釋有二重並約昔教，機中任運冥有此疑未得彰灼，有此說也。	釋有二重並約昔教，機中任運冥有此疑未得彰灼，有此說也。	06a	There are two layers of explanation, both based on the teachings of the past. The potential for this doubt existed naturally in the minds of the audience, but it had not yet been fully expressed. There is this explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a19_11']	若生死中有即大乘意，若生死中無即小乘意，既得小已，不知此證為在何許？	若生死中有即大乘意，若生死中無即小乘意，既得小已，不知此證為在何許？	06a	If there is the Great Vehicle within birth and death, if there is no birth and death within the Small Vehicle, then having attained the Small Vehicle, one does not know where this realization lies.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a19_18']	「嘗」猶曾也。	「嘗」猶曾也。	06a	Tasted is the same as once.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a21_8']	昔曾機中有此疑來，此乃以藏對衍而為中外，若今獲悟此疑必遣。	昔曾機中有此疑來，此乃以藏對衍而為中外，若今獲悟此疑必遣。	06a	In the past, there was this doubt in the potential of the audience. This is using the Tripiṭaka to contrast with the Mahāyāna as being internal and external. If one now attains enlightenment, this doubt will certainly be dispelled.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a22_14']	又「生死」下，次以生死涅槃俱名為夜，得聞中理名之為日。	又「生死」下，次以生死涅槃俱名為夜，得聞中理名之為日。	06a	Furthermore, below birth and death, next using birth and death and nirvāṇa both being called night, attaining to hear the middle principle is called the day.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a23_10']	此乃別圓以對藏通冥生疑也。	此乃別圓以對藏通冥生疑也。	06a	This is using the Distinct and Perfect to contrast with the Tripiṭaka and Shared, secretly giving rise to doubts.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a24_14']	後聞開顯此疑方除，此於方等、般若並聞故也。	後聞開顯此疑方除，此於方等、般若並聞故也。	06a	Later, hearing the revelation, this doubt was removed, because he heard this in the Vaipulya and Prajñā [sutras].
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a27_11']	然疏文語少，應更云中道實理為日，在昔於大聞此中理，雖對已證冥生猶預，未證此中如日仍隱，適聞略開尚有此疑。	然疏文語少，應更云中道實理為日，在昔於大聞此中理，雖對已證冥生猶預，未證此中如日仍隱，適聞略開尚有此疑。	06a	However, the words in the commentary are a bit lacking. It should further be said that the middle way true principle is the sun. In the past, hearing this middle principle in the Great [Vehicle], although facing what was already realized, there was still doubt secretly arising. Not realizing this middle [way] was like the sun still hidden. Just hearing the brief revelation still had this doubt.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256a28_17']	況在昔居小，今聞五佛廣顯實權，方二疑俱遣如日出也。	況在昔居小，今聞五佛廣顯實權，方二疑俱遣如日出也。	06a	How much more so for those who were in the Small [Vehicle] in the past. Now hearing the five Buddhas extensively reveal the real and provisional, the two doubts were both dispelled, like the sun rising.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b06_4']	「又世人」等者，意譬聲聞歷諸座席，或訶或被、或喜或憂，來至法華備經艱苦，自行利物無不聞知，但謂非已所任自他少別，故與諸味草創者殊，故知始自微賤具歷文武，歷淺階深知物可否，如香積菩薩更學雙流，故草創者少諳眾行，然又兩途互為勝劣，不可一向。	「又世人」等者，意譬聲聞歷諸座席，或訶或被、或喜或憂，來至法華備經艱苦，自行利物無不聞知，但謂非已所任自他少別，故與諸味草創者殊，故知始自微賤具歷文武，歷淺階深知物可否，如香積菩薩更學雙流，故草創者少諳眾行，然又兩途互為勝劣，不可一向。	06a	Also, worldly people... and so forth, the meaning is to illustrate how the śrāvakas went through various seats, sometimes being scolded and sometimes being delighted, sometimes joyful and sometimes worried, coming to the Lotus Sūtra and experiencing hardships, themselves benefiting others and hearing and knowing everything, but only thinking that it was not their responsibility, themselves and others being slightly different, therefore differing from the beginners of the various flavors, thus knowing that starting from humble beginnings, one goes through literature and martial arts, going through shallow stages and knowing the pros and cons of things, like the bodhisattva of Fragrant Accumulation further studying the two streams, therefore the beginners are slightly familiar with many practices, but the two paths are mutually superior and inferior, not being one-sided.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b07_7']	言「五味淘汰」者，通指五味以為淘汰，非獨般若。	言「五味淘汰」者，通指五味以為淘汰，非獨般若。	06a	As for the five flavors are refined, it generally refers to the five flavors as being refined, not just prajñā.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b08_16']	《經》云「無漏難思議」等者，昔謂無漏但至無餘，今乃方知至實道場。	《經》云「無漏難思議」等者，昔謂無漏但至無餘，今乃方知至實道場。	06a	The sūtra says the undefiled is difficult to imagine... and so forth, in the past it was said that the undefiled only reaches nirvāṇa without remainder, now it is only now known to reach the true path and site.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b10_11']	「解魔非魔」等者，昔聞異本謂佛為魔，今方知本愚覺所誤是佛，故云也。	「解魔非魔」等者，昔聞異本謂佛為魔，今方知本愚覺所誤是佛，故云也。	06a	Understanding demons and non-demons and so forth means that in the past, hearing the different teachings, one regarded the Buddha as a demon. Now, one finally understands that the original ignorance was mistaken for the Buddha, and thus it is said.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b14_1']	《經》云「佛以種種緣」等者，前以釋迦開權釋諸佛顯實，云我以無數方便種種因緣譬喻言辭等，乃至三世佛章一一皆云亦以乃至是法皆為一佛乘故。	《經》云「佛以種種緣」等者，前以釋迦開權釋諸佛顯實，云我以無數方便種種因緣譬喻言辭等，乃至三世佛章一一皆云亦以乃至是法皆為一佛乘故。	06a	The sutra says The Buddha uses various causes and conditions and so forth. Previously, using Shakyamuni's revelation of the provisional teachings, the various Buddhas' manifestation of the real teachings were explained, saying I use countless skillful means, various causes and conditions, parables, words and phrases, etc., and so forth, up to the chapter on the Buddhas of the three periods, each saying Also using, up to this Dharma is all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b14_15']	結中云「結成」者，又可為二：	結中云「結成」者，又可為二：	06a	In the conclusion, it is said The conclusion is formed. It can be divided into two parts:
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b15_7']	初一行半頌結，次一行頌成。	初一行半頌結，次一行頌成。	06a	The first one and a half lines praise the conclusion, and the next one line praises the formation.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b15_12']	初結中三：	初結中三：	06a	In the initial conclusion, there are three parts:
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b16_5']	初三句結佛音聲，即口喜。	初三句結佛音聲，即口喜。	06a	The first three lines conclude the Buddha's voice, which is the joy of the mouth.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b17_2']	次三句結意喜，還以聞佛用兼於身。	次三句結意喜，還以聞佛用兼於身。	06a	The next three lines conclude the joy of the mind, still using hearing the Buddha's voice to encompass the body.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b17_18']	故有歡喜疑除，所證所成感報作用。	故有歡喜疑除，所證所成感報作用。	06a	Therefore, there is joy, doubt is removed, what is realized, what is accomplished, the karmic retribution that is aroused, and the function of action.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b19_5']	述成上三意者，見佛述身喜，聞法述口喜，悟解述意意。	述成上三意者，見佛述身喜，聞法述口喜，悟解述意意。	06a	As for explaining the above three meanings, seeing the Buddha explains the joy of the body, hearing the Dharma explains the joy of the mouth, and understanding explains the joy of the mind.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b20_2']	昔尚曾教大，何但今日得身近耶？	昔尚曾教大，何但今日得身近耶？	06a	In the past, he was still taught the Great Vehicle, not only today did he get to be close to the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b23_3']	雖復中迷，曾聞非謬，則顯今日重聞之緣，中途教小尚不為小，今還得聞信由昔教，驗今意解準昔不虛，然見佛等三通有三領。	雖復中迷，曾聞非謬，則顯今日重聞之緣，中途教小尚不為小，今還得聞信由昔教，驗今意解準昔不虛，然見佛等三通有三領。	06a	Although he was confused in the middle, he still heard the truth, which shows that the conditions for hearing the Great Vehicle again today are not considered small, and now he can still hear it because of the teachings of the past. This verifies that his understanding of the meaning today is based on the past and is not false. However, seeing the Buddha and the other three have three general understandings.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b24_11']	言「見佛緣」者，由昔大見，乃為今日得實之緣，實方名見故也。	言「見佛緣」者，由昔大見，乃為今日得實之緣，實方名見故也。	06a	As for seeing the Buddha as a condition, it is because of seeing the Great Vehicle in the past that it becomes a condition for attaining the truth today. Only the truth is called seeing.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b25_10']	言「憂悔聞法緣」者，自中忘來由取於小。	言「憂悔聞法緣」者，自中忘來由取於小。	06a	As for regretting and hearing the Dharma as a condition, since forgetting the middle, he took the Small Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b26_13']	又聞兩酥至略說來，凡憂悔者皆由昔小故也。	又聞兩酥至略說來，凡憂悔者皆由昔小故也。	06a	Moreover, hearing the two kinds of ghee up to the brief explanation, all those who regret it are due to the Small Vehicle of the past.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b27_8']	言「不虛」者，昔元聞大信今不虛。	言「不虛」者，昔元聞大信今不虛。	06a	As for not being false, the original hearing of the Great Vehicle in the past is not false today.

It borrows the names of the separate teachings to reveal the meaning of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256b29_17']	義圓名別一切皆然，他無此意不可濫用。	義圓名別一切皆然，他無此意不可濫用。	06a	The meaning is perfect, the names are separate, and everything is so. Others do not have this meaning, so it cannot be used indiscriminately.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256c01_8']	此七無上文列兩重：	此七無上文列兩重：	06a	This seven unsurpassed has two layers listed in the text:
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0256c04_12']	初重者，前一為果、後六在因，於六因中初二六和，次二福智，次二證行，雖分三二，互相與力，是故六因並名無上，望果行因故果先因後。	初重者，前一為果、後六在因，於六因中初二六和，次二福智，次二證行，雖分三二，互相與力，是故六因並名無上，望果行因故果先因後。	06a	The first layer, the first is the fruit, and the latter six are in the cause. Among the six causes, the first two are the six harmonies, the next two are merit and wisdom, the next two are realization and practice. Although divided into three pairs, they mutually give rise to power. Therefore, the six causes are all called unsurpassed. Because they are the causes of the fruition practice, the fruit comes first and the causes come later.

First, it distinguishes the abilities of the small and great, although they are the same in having that which is able and that which is acted upon, the small and great are vastly different. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish the two abilities of the provisional and the real. If one understands the two abilities, then the two existences are present.

Relying on the teaching to leave the house, one does not see the small carriage. In the middle, one has already gone through the two flavors to be well-seasoned, and then asks the father for the carriage that was previously promised. Since it is asked, it must be given. Opening that small gate is nothing but the great teaching. Under the gate, the small principle ultimately has no separate path. The absolute principle is non-dual, and the coarse and wondrous essence is one. The Dharma abides in the Dharma position, and the characteristics of the world are always so.

Therefore, the gate of the Buddha's teachings is explained in terms of the lesser vehicle.

From Now, the explanation below, the correct explanation has a parable and a combination, and the meaning clarifies that since the small teaching is not form, it is the middle way and the Dharma realm. How can this teaching not be called impermanent?
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261b29_15']	然小理不滅、大教抑之，小教無常義同被燒猶如門楗，理非無常猶如門空，燒與安隱二義俱成。	然小理不滅、大教抑之，小教無常義同被燒猶如門楗，理非無常猶如門空，燒與安隱二義俱成。	06a	However, the small principle is not extinguished, and the great teaching suppresses it. The meaning of the impermanence of the small teaching is the same as being burned, just like the door bolt. The principle is not impermanent, just like the empty door. The two meanings of burning and peace are both established.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c02_16']	若依古人，人既被燒不得名為安隱得出，立門本意令其不燒，唯燒無出，門義不成。	若依古人，人既被燒不得名為安隱得出，立門本意令其不燒，唯燒無出，門義不成。	06a	If it is based on the ancients, since people are burned, they cannot be called safe to come out. The original intention of establishing the door is to prevent burning. Only burning without coming out, the meaning of the door is not established.

From the perspective of cause and effect, it can also be borrowed and used. For example, if the small is proven to be impermanent, how could the great be impermanent?
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c05_16']	「若小」下此更將小通對衍門。	「若小」下此更將小通對衍門。	06a	If it is small... This further uses the small to universally correspond to the Mahayana approach.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c08_11']	言「文字即解脫」等者，大小色教並皆是常，但有即不即殊，乃成燒不燒別，隨宜故不即，順理故無燒，今皆開顯即燒無燒。	言「文字即解脫」等者，大小色教並皆是常，但有即不即殊，乃成燒不燒別，隨宜故不即，順理故無燒，今皆開顯即燒無燒。	06a	As for the written words are liberation and so forth, the teachings of form in both the small and great vehicles are all permanent. There is only the difference between being immediate and not being immediate, which results in the distinction of being burned and not being burned. Because it follows the circumstances, it is not immediate. Because it accords with principle, there is no burning. Now, all are revealed as being burned and not burned.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c14_1']	「若就」下更以權實二智對釋，從施權邊故云權從所燒，同體之權本自常住，縱從覆說權為所燒，仍須分別，則三教權中唯三藏權生滅名燒，餘二少別，故先作下引證，佛元欲用實智凡案，事不獲已施於無常，無常即是所燒權智。	「若就」下更以權實二智對釋，從施權邊故云權從所燒，同體之權本自常住，縱從覆說權為所燒，仍須分別，則三教權中唯三藏權生滅名燒，餘二少別，故先作下引證，佛元欲用實智凡案，事不獲已施於無常，無常即是所燒權智。	06a	If below further uses the two wisdoms of expedient and real to explain. From the perspective of expounding the expedient, it says the expedient is what is burned. The expedient of the same essence is originally always abiding. Even if it is said from the perspective of concealment that the expedient is what is burned, it still needs to be distinguished. Among the three teachings of the expedient, only the expedient of the Tripiṭaka is called burning and perishing. The other two are slightly different. Therefore, it first cites the proof below. The Buddha originally wanted to use the wisdom of reality to govern affairs, but he had no choice but to bestow impermanence. Impermanence is precisely the expedient wisdom that is burned.

['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c15_14']	雖是一途，不及今文。	雖是一途，不及今文。	06a	Although this is one approach, it is not as good as the present text.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c17_8']	經云「若不時出必為所焚」，故得出之言非獨長者，被燒之語豈唯不信？	經云「若不時出必為所焚」，故得出之言非獨長者，被燒之語豈唯不信？	06a	The sūtra says, If it does not come out in time, it will surely be burned. Therefore, the words of coming out are not only about the elder. How could the words of being burned only refer to those who do not believe?
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c18_10']	故知教法生滅名為所燒，非由眾生不信故滅。	故知教法生滅名為所燒，非由眾生不信故滅。	06a	Therefore, know that the teaching Dharma of arising and perishing is called what is burned, not because the sentient beings' lack of faith causes it to perish.

Although play is also joyful, it is not universal in every place, because the bonds in the three realms are different.
['ZH_T34_1719_06a:0261c25_14']	又「耽湎」去合字解者，此兩字義通名樂故，故以兩字俱通見修，以著愛見俱喪道故，愛見是集集必招苦，具苦集故必無道滅。	又「耽湎」去合字解者，此兩字義通名樂故，故以兩字俱通見修，以著愛見俱喪道故，愛見是集集必招苦，具苦集故必無道滅。	06a	Moreover, the two characters addicted and immersed are explained together. These two characters have the meaning of joy in common, therefore they are used to refer to both view and cultivation afflictions, because attachment and love views both lose the way. Love views are the accumulation, accumulation necessarily attracts suffering, because they are fully endowed with suffering and accumulation, they definitely have no way and cessation.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
