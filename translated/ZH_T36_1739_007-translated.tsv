['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a11_0']	第八明攝化境界者，夫佛境無邊，順機各異，	第八明攝化境界者，夫佛境無邊，順機各異，	007	The eighth, clarifying the realm of transforming and guiding, means that the Buddha's realm is boundless, and accords with the different capacities of beings.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a13_10']	隨情廣狹見有差殊，非是如來分其量數，情微即境狹、量廣即境寬。	隨情廣狹見有差殊，非是如來分其量數，情微即境狹、量廣即境寬。	007	Following their emotions, the vastness of their views differs, but this is not the Tathāgata dividing their measure. If emotions are subtle, the realm is narrow; if the measure is vast, the realm is vast.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a15_20']	若也智契真源，佛境彌綸法界，或見閻浮為化境、或見四洲以濟生，或見形滿大千、或見報身十海，如是種種。	若也智契真源，佛境彌綸法界，或見閻浮為化境、或見四洲以濟生，或見形滿大千、或見報身十海，如是種種。	007	If one's wisdom accords with the source of truth, the Buddha's realm pervades the Dharma realm. One may see Jambudvīpa as the realm of transformation, or see the four continents as saving beings, or see the form filling the trichiliocosm, or see the reward body with ten oceans. There are various kinds like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a17_3']	器有萬端，設教不同千差萬別，啟蒙始學憑准何依？	器有萬端，設教不同千差萬別，啟蒙始學憑准何依？	007	Beings have myriad capacities, and the teachings set forth are not the same, with a thousand differences and myriad distinctions. How can beginners who are just learning rely on something to follow?
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a18_17']	略示五門識其權實，使得捨枝條而從本、返末而還源，速證菩提無令稽障。	略示五門識其權實，使得捨枝條而從本、返末而還源，速證菩提無令稽障。	007	Briefly indicating five approaches can make them recognize the provisional and real, enabling them to abandon the branches and follow the root, return to the source from the end, quickly realize enlightenment, and not allow hindrances.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a21_8']	一人中見佛境界、二諸天見佛境界、三二乘中羅漢見佛攝化境界、四權教菩薩見佛境界、五實教菩薩見佛境界。	一人中見佛境界、二諸天見佛境界、三二乘中羅漢見佛攝化境界、四權教菩薩見佛境界、五實教菩薩見佛境界。	007	The first is the Buddha's realm seen by ordinary people, the second is the Buddha's realm seen by various gods, the third is the Buddha's realm of subduing and transforming seen by arhats among the two vehicles, the fourth is the Buddha's realm seen by bodhisattvas of provisional teachings, and the fifth is the Buddha's realm seen by bodhisattvas of true teachings.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a23_1']	第一人中見佛境界者，但見化一閻浮提眾生。	第一人中見佛境界者，但見化一閻浮提眾生。	007	As for the first, the Buddha's realm seen by ordinary people, they only see the Buddha transforming and subduing the sentient beings of one Jambudvīpa.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a25_8']	第二諸天見佛境界者，但應自見境，見佛亦然，隨自見廣狹故。	第二諸天見佛境界者，但應自見境，見佛亦然，隨自見廣狹故。	007	As for the second, the Buddha's realm seen by various gods, they should only see their own realm, and seeing the Buddha is also like this, because it accords with the vastness or narrowness of their own vision.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a27_13']	如帝釋、梵王及諸天王，即是菩薩位，即依菩薩位配所見佛攝化境界廣狹，不可依諸凡夫天人之類。	如帝釋、梵王及諸天王，即是菩薩位，即依菩薩位配所見佛攝化境界廣狹，不可依諸凡夫天人之類。	007	Gods such as Śakra, Brahmā, and the various heavenly kings are the positions of bodhisattvas, and the vastness or narrowness of the Buddha's realm of subduing and transforming seen by them is assigned according to the positions of bodhisattvas, and cannot be based on the types of ordinary gods and humans.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760a29_3']	如帝釋即是二地菩薩位，乃至漸昇至梵天王是十地菩薩位也。	如帝釋即是二地菩薩位，乃至漸昇至梵天王是十地菩薩位也。	007	For example, Śakra is the position of a bodhisattva on the second ground, and gradually ascending to the position of Brahmā is the position of a bodhisattva on the tenth ground.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b03_3']	或時以佛神通力成就眾生，亦令人天中凡夫及二乘并小菩薩總得見佛報土境界故，即如《維摩經》，佛以足指按地所現淨土是也。	或時以佛神通力成就眾生，亦令人天中凡夫及二乘并小菩薩總得見佛報土境界故，即如《維摩經》，佛以足指按地所現淨土是也。	007	Sometimes, by the Buddha's supernormal powers, he perfects sentient beings, and also causes ordinary people, the two vehicles, and lesser bodhisattvas in the human and heavenly realms to all see the Buddha's reward land realm. It is like the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra, where the Buddha uses his toe to tap the ground and manifests a pure land.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b05_17']	或時以佛神力，亦令人天總得相見故，即如《大集經》中所說寶坊處，欲界上色界下大集人天之眾，總在其中，如彼經說。	或時以佛神力，亦令人天總得相見故，即如《大集經》中所說寶坊處，欲界上色界下大集人天之眾，總在其中，如彼經說。	007	Sometimes, by the Buddha's supernormal powers, he also causes people in the human and heavenly realms to all see each other. It is like what is explained in the Mahāsaṃnipāta-sūtra, where the assembly of humans and gods from the upper realm of the desire realm and the lower realm of the form realm all gather in the jeweled abode. As that sūtra explains.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b08_1']	第三二乘中羅漢見佛攝化境界者，如大羅漢，以天眼力，得見佛攝化三千大千之境界也。	第三二乘中羅漢見佛攝化境界者，如大羅漢，以天眼力，得見佛攝化三千大千之境界也。	007	Third, as for the arhats of the two vehicles seeing the Buddha's realm of subduing and transforming, great arhats use the power of their heavenly eye to see the Buddha's realm of subduing and transforming the trichiliocosm.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b08_8']	即如阿那律云：	即如阿那律云：	007	It is like what Aniruddha says:
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b09_16']	「我以天眼見釋迦牟尼佛土三千大千世界，如觀掌中菴摩勒果。	「我以天眼見釋迦牟尼佛土三千大千世界，如觀掌中菴摩勒果。	007	I use my heavenly eye to see Śākyamuni Buddha's land of the trichiliocosm, like seeing an āmalaka fruit in the palm of my hand.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b10_15']	」如小羅漢即不定，或見佛攝化一閻浮提。	」如小羅漢即不定，或見佛攝化一閻浮提。	007	It is like a small arhat who is not fixed, and may see the Buddha's transformative influence over one Jambudvīpa.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b12_6']	此即以久伏忍力能斷結使，未有定力亦名斷結，未有力通變等事。	此即以久伏忍力能斷結使，未有定力亦名斷結，未有力通變等事。	007	This is because by the power of long-suppressed patience, one can sever the fetters, but one does not yet have the power of concentration, and is also called one who has severed the fetters, but does not yet have the power of spiritual transformation and other matters.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b13_8']	如以此羅漢，或見佛攝化四洲及上三界境界也。	如以此羅漢，或見佛攝化四洲及上三界境界也。	007	It is like this arhat, who may see the Buddha's transformative influence over the four continents and the realms above the three realms.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b13_18']	此廣說在小乘諸部中。	此廣說在小乘諸部中。	007	This is explained in detail in the various schools of the Lesser Vehicle.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b16_3']	第四權教菩薩見佛攝化境界者，初地百佛、二地千佛、三地萬佛境界以漸增，如三乘大乘教說。	第四權教菩薩見佛攝化境界者，初地百佛、二地千佛、三地萬佛境界以漸增，如三乘大乘教說。	007	Fourth, the realm of the Buddha's transformative influence seen by the bodhisattvas of the provisional teaching is that the bodhisattvas of the first ground see the realms of a hundred Buddhas, those of the second ground see the realms of a thousand Buddhas, and those of the third ground see the realms of ten thousand Buddhas, gradually increasing, as explained in the teachings of the Three Vehicles and the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b18_18']	第五實教菩薩見佛攝化境界者，初地菩薩即見多百佛，即是無盡之百，不是一百之百。	第五實教菩薩見佛攝化境界者，初地菩薩即見多百佛，即是無盡之百，不是一百之百。	007	Fifth, the realm of the Buddha's transformative influence seen by the bodhisattvas of the true teaching is that the bodhisattvas of the first ground see many hundreds of Buddhas, which are the endless hundreds, not the hundreds of a hundred.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b19_17']	二地菩薩即見多千佛等，即是無盡之千故。	二地菩薩即見多千佛等，即是無盡之千故。	007	The bodhisattvas of the second ground see many thousands of Buddhas, and so on, because they are the endless thousands.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b20_9']	三地菩薩即云多千萬等。	三地菩薩即云多千萬等。	007	The bodhisattvas of the third ground say many millions, and so on.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b21_9']	以實而論，諸地菩薩皆悉齊見，如帝網等。	以實而論，諸地菩薩皆悉齊見，如帝網等。	007	In reality, all the bodhisattvas of the various stages see equally, like the net of Indra.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b21_16']	三賢菩薩亦然。	三賢菩薩亦然。	007	The three sagely bodhisattvas are also like this.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b23_3']	非但十佛剎微塵數蓮華藏為其報境，法界虛空總皆平等。	非但十佛剎微塵數蓮華藏為其報境，法界虛空總皆平等。	007	Not only are the ten buddha lands and the dust motes of the lotus treasury their reward realm, but the entire Dharma realm and space are all equally so.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b25_8']	為十住初心初見道時，即已無大小見故，即總見佛化境皆如法界，不分大小，約行布之中寄位階降。	為十住初心初見道時，即已無大小見故，即總見佛化境皆如法界，不分大小，約行布之中寄位階降。	007	For the beginner of the ten abodes, when first seeing the path, they have already eliminated the views of size, so they see the Buddha's transformed realm as being like the Dharma realm, not distinguishing between large and small. Within the arrangement of practices, they provisionally rank the stages.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b26_18']	如此經，初地見多百佛境界者，即明滿義故，非如三乘單百之百。	如此經，初地見多百佛境界者，即明滿義故，非如三乘單百之百。	007	In this sutra, seeing the realm of many hundreds of buddhas in the first ground is because it clarifies the meaning of fulfillment, not like the three vehicles' mere hundred buddhas.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b27_11']	此多百者，即齊無盡之數故。	此多百者，即齊無盡之數故。	007	This many hundreds is equal to the number of endlessness.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760b29_14']	如三乘教，化佛即攝一四天下，報佛即云攝化千百億四天下為一釋迦報境，如《梵網經》所說。	如三乘教，化佛即攝一四天下，報佛即云攝化千百億四天下為一釋迦報境，如《梵網經》所說。	007	In the three vehicle teachings, the transformed buddha encompasses one four-continent world, and the reward buddha is said to encompass the thousand koṭīs of four-continent worlds of the transformed buddhas as the reward realm of one Śākyamuni, as explained in the Brahma's Net Sutra.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c02_13']	如《華嚴經》所說毘盧遮那攝化境界，且約立一大蓮華藏世界海，廣大無際與虛空法界等。	如《華嚴經》所說毘盧遮那攝化境界，且約立一大蓮華藏世界海，廣大無際與虛空法界等。	007	As explained in the Flower Ornament Sutra, the realm of Vairocana's transformative power is generally established as a great lotus treasury world ocean, vast and boundless, equal to the Dharma realm of space.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c03_20']	但為化眾生故，約陳形狀，令眾生心廣大，發開狹劣心故。	但為化眾生故，約陳形狀，令眾生心廣大，發開狹劣心故。	007	But in order to transform sentient beings, the shape is described, causing sentient beings to expand their minds and abandon narrow and inferior thoughts.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c05_4']	於此大蓮華中，總言有十不可說佛剎微塵數世界種。	於此大蓮華中，總言有十不可說佛剎微塵數世界種。	007	Within this great lotus, it is generally said there are ten ineffable buddha lands of world systems.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c08_8']	為教文有限，且立其百二十一箇世界種，中心有十一箇世界種，上下各且二十重蓮華藏世界，最下重中有一佛世界微塵數廣大世界圍繞。	為教文有限，且立其百二十一箇世界種，中心有十一箇世界種，上下各且二十重蓮華藏世界，最下重中有一佛世界微塵數廣大世界圍繞。	007	Because the teaching text has limitations, it establishes one hundred and twenty-one world systems. In the center there are eleven world systems, each with twenty layers of lotus treasury worlds above and below. In the lowest layer, there are buddha lands as vast worlds surrounding it.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c09_3']	次上第二重，二佛世界微塵數。	次上第二重，二佛世界微塵數。	007	In the second layer above, there are two buddha lands as vast worlds.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c09_17']	次上第三重，三佛世界微塵數。	次上第三重，三佛世界微塵數。	007	In the third layer above, there are three buddha lands as vast worlds.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c10_18']	此十一箇世界種皆悉如是，從下向上轉轉倍增。	此十一箇世界種皆悉如是，從下向上轉轉倍增。	007	These eleven groups of worlds are all like this, increasing in size as one goes up.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c12_15']	最上重中，具足二十佛世界微塵數廣大剎，一一剎各有十佛剎微塵數諸小剎圍遶。	最上重中，具足二十佛世界微塵數廣大剎，一一剎各有十佛剎微塵數諸小剎圍遶。	007	In the uppermost layer, there are twenty worlds, each as vast as the dust particles in a buddha-world, each surrounded by ten worlds the size of dust particles in a buddha-world.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c14_10']	其十一箇二十重世界外，有一百箇一重世界種，圍繞十一箇二十重世界。	其十一箇二十重世界外，有一百箇一重世界種，圍繞十一箇二十重世界。	007	Outside the eleven groups of twenty layers of worlds, there are one hundred groups of single-layered worlds surrounding the eleven groups of twenty-layered worlds.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c16_10']	此一百箇世界種外，近金剛山復有十箇四重世界種，其中國剎重重之內，如上所說。	此一百箇世界種外，近金剛山復有十箇四重世界種，其中國剎重重之內，如上所說。	007	Near the Diamond Mountains outside these one hundred groups of worlds are ten groups of four-layered worlds, with the central lands and worlds within them as described above.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c17_15']	於金剛山內圍繞如上諸世界種等，如天帝網分布而住。	於金剛山內圍繞如上諸世界種等，如天帝網分布而住。	007	Within the Diamond Mountains, surrounding the groups of worlds as described above, they are distributed like the net of Indra, abiding there.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c18_15']	如來所化，周遍其間淨穢純雜諸世界海等。	如來所化，周遍其間淨穢純雜諸世界海等。	007	The transformations of the Tathāgata pervade throughout, in the pure and impure, mixed and unmixed world oceans, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c21_16']	如三乘中所說世界種者，數三千大千之剎至一恒河沙為一世界性，數性世界至恒河沙為一世界海數海世界至恒河沙為一世界種。	如三乘中所說世界種者，數三千大千之剎至一恒河沙為一世界性，數性世界至恒河沙為一世界海數海世界至恒河沙為一世界種。	007	As for the types of worlds explained in the three vehicles, it is said that three thousand great one thousand worlds to the number of one Ganges river sand is one world nature. Counting world natures to the number of one Ganges river sand is one world ocean. Counting world oceans to the number of one Ganges river sand is one world type.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c26_5']	如此經世界並數一佛剎微塵、二佛剎微塵、三佛剎微塵，如是倍增至最上重中二十佛剎微塵數世界，如是上下通數總二百一十佛剎微塵數廣大剎始成一世界種，非為恒沙以限其數。	如此經世界並數一佛剎微塵、二佛剎微塵、三佛剎微塵，如是倍增至最上重中二十佛剎微塵數世界，如是上下通數總二百一十佛剎微塵數廣大剎始成一世界種，非為恒沙以限其數。	007	In this sutra, the worlds are counted as one buddha land dust, two buddha land dusts, three buddha land dusts, and so on, increasing in this way up to the highest layer, which has twenty buddha land dusts of worlds. Counting up and down in this way, a total of two hundred and ten buddha land dusts of vast lands form one world type, and it is not that the Ganges river sand is used to limit its number.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c26_18']	三乘之中多取恒河沙數為量。	三乘之中多取恒河沙數為量。	007	In the three vehicles, the number of Ganges river sands is often taken as the measure.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c28_4']	如此經中，常取一佛剎塵、十佛剎塵，為表無盡為其數。	如此經中，常取一佛剎塵、十佛剎塵，為表無盡為其數。	007	In this sutra, one buddha land dust and ten buddha land dusts are always taken to represent infinity as its number.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0760c29_8']	如是增廣，令小狹劣眾生知佛攝化境界，發菩提心。	如是增廣，令小狹劣眾生知佛攝化境界，發菩提心。	007	In this way, it is extended and expanded, causing small and inferior sentient beings to know the realm of the Buddha's transformative power and to give rise to the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a02_2']	其佛攝化境界，一一塵中境界與法界虛空界等，不言獨化三千大千世界。	其佛攝化境界，一一塵中境界與法界虛空界等，不言獨化三千大千世界。	007	The realm of that Buddha's transformative power, in each particle, is equal to the dharma realm and the realm of space, not just transforming the trichiliocosm.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a02_20']	於中表法，至後釋〈華藏世界品〉廣明。	於中表法，至後釋〈華藏世界品〉廣明。	007	The meaning symbolized within this will be extensively explained later in the chapter on the Flower Treasury World.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a05_1']	第九明因果延促者，夫法界圓寂無始無終，理智虛空非因非果，但為有情存量，假寄其名。	第九明因果延促者，夫法界圓寂無始無終，理智虛空非因非果，但為有情存量，假寄其名。	007	The ninth point clarifies the extension and contraction of cause and effect. The dharma realm is perfect quiescence, without beginning or end. Wisdom and principle are like empty space, neither cause nor effect. However, for sentient beings who cling to measurements, it is provisionally given a name.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a05_11']	情亡量絕，何名能立？	情亡量絕，何名能立？	007	When emotions are gone and measurements are transcended, what name can be established?
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a06_9']	名不自施，本由量起，量亡情盡，名亦自真。	名不自施，本由量起，量亡情盡，名亦自真。	007	Names are not given by themselves, but arise from measurements. When measurements are gone and emotions end, names are also truly so.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a07_4']	今以無名之真名，談無果之真果；	今以無名之真名，談無果之真果；	007	Now, with the true name that is without name, I discuss the true effect that is without effect;
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a07_18']	以無說之真說，說無因之真因。	以無說之真說，說無因之真因。	007	With the true explanation that is without speaking, I explain the true cause that is without cause.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a10_16']	啟蒙之士不可以滯其名，始學之流不可以廢其說，滯名則名立、廢說則言生，當可任情隨緣，起唯法起，若無緣者，滅唯法滅。	啟蒙之士不可以滯其名，始學之流不可以廢其說，滯名則名立、廢說則言生，當可任情隨緣，起唯法起，若無緣者，滅唯法滅。	007	Those who are beginning their studies cannot be stuck on its name, and those who are just learning cannot abandon its teachings. If they are stuck on the name, the name is established; if they abandon the teachings, words arise. They should be able to follow their feelings and circumstances, and the arising is only the arising of the Dharma. If there is no condition, the cessation is only the cessation of the Dharma.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a11_4']	有此法者，性不相知。	有此法者，性不相知。	007	Those who have this Dharma do not know each other's natures.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a12_17']	今談因果延促，如空中鳥跡、如石女之子，但為眾生情有愚智，隨心照義。	今談因果延促，如空中鳥跡、如石女之子，但為眾生情有愚智，隨心照義。	007	Now discussing the extension and contraction of cause and effect is like a bird's tracks in the sky, like the child of a stone woman. It is only because sentient beings have feelings of foolishness and wisdom that the mind illuminates the meaning according to the mind.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a14_11']	或遲速不同，劈竹蹬梯稱機各別，因茲之類延促不同，非謂日月與作時分。	或遲速不同，劈竹蹬梯稱機各別，因茲之類延促不同，非謂日月與作時分。	007	Sometimes the speed is different, like splitting bamboo or climbing a ladder, each response is different. Because of this, the extension and contraction are not the same, it is not that the sun and moon make the time divisions.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a15_11']	教不自施，因機故起，教隨根應，有根教生。	教不自施，因機故起，教隨根應，有根教生。	007	The teaching is not given by itself, it arises due to conditions. The teaching responds to the faculties, and the teaching arises due to the faculties.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a16_16']	今以依根，約立十門因果延促，使得啟蒙之士後學無疑也。	今以依根，約立十門因果延促，使得啟蒙之士後學無疑也。	007	Now, based on the faculties, ten approaches to the extension and contraction of cause and effect are established, so that those who are beginning their studies and later learners will have no doubts.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a17_11']	第一小乘善來得阿羅漢果。	第一小乘善來得阿羅漢果。	007	The first is the Hinayana, where one attains the fruit of Arhatship through the Come, O Monk ordination.
['ZH_T36_1739_007:0761a18_11']	第二小乘一生得阿羅漢果。	第二小乘一生得阿羅漢果。	007	Second, the small vehicle attains the fruit of arhatship in one lifetime.
