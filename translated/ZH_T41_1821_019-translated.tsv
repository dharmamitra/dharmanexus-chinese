['ZH_T41_1821_019:0297c02_9']	非全第六種姓皆定不退。	非全第六種姓皆定不退。	It is not that all of the sixth seed nature is definitely non-retrogressing.

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299a15_13']	一執有漏戒等為道。	一執有漏戒等為道。	The first is the view that considers impure precepts, etc., to be the path.

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299a28_5']	五部所斷緣有漏惑皆迷苦故。	五部所斷緣有漏惑皆迷苦故。	Because all the defilements that are eliminated by the five categories and that take contaminated objects as their objects are deluded regarding suffering,

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b01_3']	但計麁果為彼因故。	但計麁果為彼因故。	Because it only takes the precepts regarding cows as its object and so on, and because it only regards the gross effect as their cause,
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b01_12', 'ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b02_4']	由此已遮經主所難。🔽迷苦諦故有太過失。	由此已遮經主所難。 迷苦諦故有太過失。	this has already refuted the objection raised by the treatise master.🔽Because it is deluded regarding the truth of suffering, there is the fault of over-extension.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b02_13']	緣有漏惑皆迷苦故。	緣有漏惑皆迷苦故。	Because all the defilements that take contaminated objects as their objects are deluded regarding suffering,
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b03_4']	以非一切緣有漏惑。	以非一切緣有漏惑。	Because not all contaminated afflictions are [conditions for the arising of afflictions].
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b03_13']	皆以果苦為所緣故。	皆以果苦為所緣故。	Because not all defiled delusions that have contaminated dharmas as objects take the suffering of the effect as their object.🔽How can there be the fault of over-extension?
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b04_11']	如何得有太過失耶　俱舍師破云。	如何得有太過失耶　俱舍師破云。	The masters of the Abhidharma-kośa refute this, saying:
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b05_2']	苦下戒禁緣有漏。	苦下戒禁緣有漏。	The contaminated dharmas that are the objects of the views of purity and efficacy are the suffering of the effect.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b05_8']	即於果處生。	即於果處生。	They arise in the place of the effect.

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b09_7']	諸緣見道所斷法生。	諸緣見道所斷法生。	The dharmas that are eliminated by the path of insight are also born from the objects of the views of purity and efficacy.

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b10_8']	正理救云。	正理救云。	The orthodox masters of the Abhidharma-kośa rescue this by saying:
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b10_17']	然於非道計為道中。	然於非道計為道中。	However, in the case of taking that which is not the path to be the path,
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b11_15']	若違見強道則見道所斷解云彼論意說。	若違見強道則見道所斷解云彼論意說。	if it contradicts the strong views, the path is eliminated by the path of insight. The commentary explains that the meaning of that treatise is as follows:
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b11_24']	非道計道諸戒禁取。	非道計道諸戒禁取。	Among the views of purity and efficacy that take that which is not the path to be the path,

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b12_20']	若非果處起緣親迷道為所緣者。	若非果處起緣親迷道為所緣者。	If it does not arise in the realm of the fruit, and takes as its object the path that is directly mistaken,
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b12_35']	違見道強則見道斷　俱舍師破云。	違見道強則見道斷　俱舍師破云。	then it is strong in contradicting the path of seeing and is eliminated by the path of seeing. The masters of the Abhidharma-kośa refute this, saying:
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b13_13']	兩種戒禁俱緣有漏俱非道計道。	兩種戒禁俱緣有漏俱非道計道。	Both kinds of precepts and prohibitions take as their object contaminated dharmas, and both mistakenly take what is not the path to be the path.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b14_3']	何故一於果處起。	何故一於果處起。	Why does one arise in the realm of the fruit,
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b14_9']	一非果處起。	一非果處起。	and one does not arise in the realm of the fruit?
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b14_18']	義既是齊應俱果起。	義既是齊應俱果起。	Since the meaning is the same, they should both arise in the realm of the fruit.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b15_8']	若俱果起相還無別。	若俱果起相還無別。	If they both arise in the realm of the fruit, then there is still no difference in their characteristics.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b15_13']	違道徒言。	違道徒言。	Contradicting the path is just empty talk.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b16_8']	又緣道諦至理亦不成者。	又緣道諦至理亦不成者。	Moreover, taking the truth of the path as an object, the reasoning is also not established.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0299b16_19']	此即第三即執見．疑難。	此即第三即執見．疑難。	This is the third objection, regarding the views and doubts.

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a15_5']	有說我倒攝身見全者。	有說我倒攝身見全者。	Some say that the perversion of self includes the entire view of self.

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a16_10']	我倒異說故別敘也。	我倒異說故別敘也。	The explanation of the perversion of self is different, so it is described separately.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a16_18']	故婆沙一百四云。	故婆沙一百四云。	Therefore, the Abhidharma-mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra, fascicle 104, says:

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a21_6']	然毘婆沙決定義者。	然毘婆沙決定義者。	However, the definitive meaning of the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a21_15']	約部分別十二見中。	約部分別十二見中。	is that, among the twelve views distinguished in terms of their parts,
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a22_6']	唯二見半是顛倒體。	唯二見半是顛倒體。	only two and a half views are the substance of perversions.

['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a23_15']	斷．常二見行相乖違。	斷．常二見行相乖違。	The modes of activity of the two views of annihilation and permanence are contradictory.
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a24_14']	故可說言二體各別　此論．婆沙．正理。	故可說言二體各別　此論．婆沙．正理。	Therefore, it can be said that the substances of the two are distinct. This treatise, the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra, and the Nyāyānusāra
['ZH_T41_1821_019:0300a25_5']	皆約五部十二見出體。	皆約五部十二見出體。	all determine the substance of the views in terms of the five categories and twelve views.
