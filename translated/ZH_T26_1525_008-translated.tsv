They are unable to cultivate the four immeasurables in accordance with reality, are unable to ultimately sever all afflictions, and can only subdue all afflictions.

Just as a person in meditative concentration can abandon the self-characteristics of the four great elements through the power of following the mind,
['ZH_T26_1525_008:0265c03_11']	此亦如是，雖復成就有為法相，以諸菩薩清淨持戒諸功德眾，修四無量隨順心力成就果報，而不隨順四無量心。	此亦如是，雖復成就有為法相，以諸菩薩清淨持戒諸功德眾，修四無量隨順心力成就果報，而不隨順四無量心。	it is also like this. Although one may accomplish the characteristics of conditioned phenomena, because bodhisattvas purify their observance of precepts and various meritorious qualities, cultivate the four immeasurables, and follow the power of the mind to accomplish karmic retribution, they do not follow the four immeasurables.🔽For this reason, in the Sūtra of the Questions of the Holy Sagaramati Bodhisattva,
