['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c14_3']	遍行隨眠差別有二，謂於自界地、他界地遍行。	遍行隨眠差別有二，謂於自界地、他界地遍行。	Pervasive latent tendencies are differentiated into two: pervasive in one's own realm and stage, and pervasive in other realms and stages.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c14_20']	不遍隨眠差別亦二，謂有漏、無漏緣。	不遍隨眠差別亦二，謂有漏、無漏緣。	Non-pervasive latent tendencies are also differentiated into two: with contaminated and uncontaminated objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c16_3']	且遍行中自界地者，普於五部自界地法所緣隨增。	且遍行中自界地者，普於五部自界地法所緣隨增。	First, as for the pervasive in one's own realm and stage, they increase due to objects in the five categories of dharmas in one's own realm and stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c17_7']	不遍行中有漏緣者，唯於自部自界地法所緣隨增。	不遍行中有漏緣者，唯於自部自界地法所緣隨增。	As for the non-pervasive contaminants that have impure objects, they only increase in accordance with their objects in the dharmas of their own category, realm, and stage.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c18_15']	不遍行中無漏緣者，及遍行中他界緣者，於所緣境無隨增義。	不遍行中無漏緣者，及遍行中他界緣者，於所緣境無隨增義。	As for the non-pervasive contaminants that have pure objects, and the pervasive contaminants that have objects in other realms, they do not have the meaning of increasing in accordance with their objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c19_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c19_14']	彼所緣境非所攝受及相違故。	彼所緣境非所攝受及相違故。	Because the objects they take as their objects are neither appropriated nor opposed.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c21_13']	謂若有法為此地中身見及愛攝為己有，可有為此身見愛地中所有隨眠所緣隨增理。	謂若有法為此地中身見及愛攝為己有，可有為此身見愛地中所有隨眠所緣隨增理。	That is to say, if there are dharmas that are appropriated as one's own by the view of the aggregates and craving of a certain stage, then it is reasonable that the latent tendencies in that stage of the view of the aggregates and craving would increase in accordance with their objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c23_3']	言隨增者，謂諸隨眠於此法中隨住增長，即是隨縛增惛滯義。	言隨增者，謂諸隨眠於此法中隨住增長，即是隨縛增惛滯義。	As for increasing, it means that the latent tendencies abide and increase in accordance with a dharma. This is the meaning of following, binding, and increasing confusion and obstruction.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c24_2']	如衣有潤塵隨住中，如有潤田種子增長。	如衣有潤塵隨住中，如有潤田種子增長。	It is like dust that abides in moisture, and like seeds that increase and grow in moist fields.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c25_4']	非諸無漏及上地法，為諸下身見愛攝為己有故。	非諸無漏及上地法，為諸下身見愛攝為己有故。	Because the pure dharmas and the dharmas of higher stages are not appropriated as one's own by the view of the aggregates and craving of lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c26_4']	緣彼下惑非所緣隨增，以不隨縛增惛滯故。	緣彼下惑非所緣隨增，以不隨縛增惛滯故。	Therefore the lower defilements that take them as objects do not increase in accordance with their objects, because they do not follow, bind, and increase confusion and obstruction.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c27_13']	若下地生求上地等，是善法欲，非謂染污，為求離染此欲生故。	若下地生求上地等，是善法欲，非謂染污，為求離染此欲生故。	If one is born in a lower stage and seeks the higher stages, etc., this is wholesome desire, not defiled, because this desire arises in order to seek separation from defilements.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0898c29_4']	聖道涅槃及上地法，與能緣彼下惑相違，故彼二亦無所緣隨增理。	聖道涅槃及上地法，與能緣彼下惑相違，故彼二亦無所緣隨增理。	Because the noble path, nirvana, and dharmas of the upper stages are in opposition to the lower defilements that can take them as objects, therefore those two also lack the principle of increasing by the object.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a01_3']	如於炎石足不隨住，如火焰中鵝不增長。	如於炎石足不隨住，如火焰中鵝不增長。	Just as the foot does not remain on a hot stone, just as a goose does not increase in the flame.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a01_13']	此隨眠起，親由所依。	此隨眠起，親由所依。	The arising of these latent tendencies is directly due to the support.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a02_2']	然正起時，兼託彼境。	然正起時，兼託彼境。	However, when they are actually arising, they rely on that object.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a02_11']	如是已辯所緣隨增。	如是已辯所緣隨增。	Thus we have explained how they increase by the object.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a03_9']	隨何隨眠，於相應法由相應故於彼隨增？	隨何隨眠，於相應法由相應故於彼隨增？	By what latent tendencies do they increase by association with associated dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a04_10']	所說隨增謂至未斷，故初頌首摽未斷言。	所說隨增謂至未斷，故初頌首摽未斷言。	What is said to increase means until they are eliminated, therefore the first verse begins with the word not yet eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a06_9']	由此應知，諸緣無漏他界地煩惱唯相應隨增，諸緣有漏自界地遍具有所緣相應隨增。	由此應知，諸緣無漏他界地煩惱唯相應隨增，諸緣有漏自界地遍具有所緣相應隨增。	By this one should understand that all those that take the uncontaminated and other realms and stages as objects only increase by association. All those that take the contaminated and their own realms and stages as objects have both increasing by the object and increasing by association.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a06_18']	去來隨眠有隨增不？	去來隨眠有隨增不？	Do past and future latent tendencies have increase or not?
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a07_9']	應言定有，能發得故。	應言定有，能發得故。	It should be said that they definitely exist, because they can be aroused and obtained.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a08_7']	若異此者，諸異生類無染心位應離隨眠。	若異此者，諸異生類無染心位應離隨眠。	If it were otherwise, then when ordinary beings are in a state of non-defilement, they should be free from the latent afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a08_12']	然世尊言：	然世尊言：	However, the World-Honored One has said:
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a09_15']	幼稚童子嬰孩眠病，雖無染欲而有欲貪隨眠隨增。	幼稚童子嬰孩眠病，雖無染欲而有欲貪隨眠隨增。	Even though young children, infants, and those in sleep or illness do not have defiled desire, they still have the latent afflictions of desire and craving.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a11_13']	故說隨增乃至未斷，若彼已斷即無所緣，相應隨增隨眠寧有，彼猶不失隨眠相故。	故說隨增乃至未斷，若彼已斷即無所緣，相應隨增隨眠寧有，彼猶不失隨眠相故。	Therefore, it is said that they increase until they are eliminated. If they have already been eliminated, then there is no object-support. How can there be latent afflictions that increase through association? Because they still do not lose the characteristics of latent afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a13_2']	謂由對治壞其勢力故不隨增，然彼隨眠體相不失，故言猶有。	謂由對治壞其勢力故不隨增，然彼隨眠體相不失，故言猶有。	This means that because the antidotes destroy their power, they do not increase. However, the substance and characteristics of those latent afflictions are not lost, so it is said that they still exist.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a14_1']	或據曾當有此用故，今雖無用亦號隨眠。	或據曾當有此用故，今雖無用亦號隨眠。	Or, because they once had this function and will have it again, even though they do not have it now, they are still called latent afflictions.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a14_19']	如失國王猶存王號，工匠停作其名尚存。	如失國王猶存王號，工匠停作其名尚存。	It is like a deposed king who is still called a king, or a craftsman who has stopped working but is still called by his profession.

['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a16_0']	上二界隨眠，　　及欲身邊見，	上二界隨眠，　　及欲身邊見，	The latent afflictions of the two upper realms, as well as the views of self and extremes in the desire realm,
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a17_13']	彼俱癡無記，　　所餘皆不善。	彼俱癡無記，　　所餘皆不善。	The ignorance associated with them is neutral, the rest are unwholesome.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a18_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a19_19']	色無色界一切隨眠，四支五支定所伏故，無有勢力招異熟果，故彼皆是無記性攝。	色無色界一切隨眠，四支五支定所伏故，無有勢力招異熟果，故彼皆是無記性攝。	All proclivities of the form and formless realms are included in the category of neutral, because they are subdued by the four and five branches of samādhi, and they do not have the power to summon results as retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a21_7']	若謂彼能招異熟果，應上二界有非愛受，染招愛受理不成故。	若謂彼能招異熟果，應上二界有非愛受，染招愛受理不成故。	If it is said that they can summon results as retribution, then in the two upper realms there would be unpleasant feelings, because the principle of the summoning of pleasant feelings by the defiled is not established.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a22_6']	然無聖道成無記失，唯有漏法有異熟故。	然無聖道成無記失，唯有漏法有異熟故。	However, there is no error in saying that they are neutral because the holy path exists, because only contaminated dharmas have results as retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a23_5']	此種類中無異熟者，方可說為無記性故。	此種類中無異熟者，方可說為無記性故。	Only those in this category that do not have results as retribution can be said to be neutral.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a24_14']	身邊二見及相應癡，欲界繫者亦無記性，顛倒轉故，寧非不善。	身邊二見及相應癡，欲界繫者亦無記性，顛倒轉故，寧非不善。	The two views of person and aggregates, and the ignorance associated with them, in the realm of desire are also neutral, because they function in a deluded way. How can they not be unwholesome?
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a25_13']	且有身見，順善行故，違斷善故，定非不善。	且有身見，順善行故，違斷善故，定非不善。	First, the view of a person is not unwholesome, because it accords with wholesome conduct and because it opposes the severing of wholesome roots.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a27_11']	愛慢雖有順修福行，而由見力引彼令起，又斷善時為強因故、背善友故，欲俱不善。	愛慢雖有順修福行，而由見力引彼令起，又斷善時為強因故、背善友故，欲俱不善。	Although craving and pride may conform to the practice of meritorious actions, they are drawn forth by the power of views and cause their arising. Moreover, at the time of severing good roots, they are strong causes, and because one turns one's back on good friends, they are unwholesome in association with desire.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a28_19']	邊執見中執斷邊者，計生斷故，不違涅槃、順厭離門，故非不善。	邊執見中執斷邊者，計生斷故，不違涅槃、順厭離門，故非不善。	As for the extreme views, those who hold the extreme of annihilation calculate the annihilation of birth, and therefore do not contradict nirvana, and conform to the gate of disgust and detachment, and therefore are not unwholesome.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a29_3']	如世尊說：	如世尊說：	As the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899a29_17']	若起此見，我於一切皆不忍受。	若起此見，我於一切皆不忍受。	If one gives rise to this view, I do not tolerate it in any way.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b01_16']	當知此見不順貪欲，隨順無貪，乃至廣說。	當知此見不順貪欲，隨順無貪，乃至廣說。	One should know that this view does not conform to craving, but conforms to the absence of craving, and so on, and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b02_1']	又世尊說：	又世尊說：	Moreover, the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b03_5']	於諸外道諸見趣中此見最勝，謂我不有，我所亦不有。	於諸外道諸見趣中此見最勝，謂我不有，我所亦不有。	Among the various heterodox views, this view is the most supreme: 'I do not exist, and what belongs to me also does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b03_16']	我當不有，我所當不有。	我當不有，我所當不有。	I will not exist in the future, and what belongs to me will not exist in the future.'
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b04_15']	執常邊見順我見生，是無記理，如我見說。	執常邊見順我見生，是無記理，如我見說。	The extreme view of permanence arises in conformity with the view of self, and the principle is neutral, as explained in the view of self.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b05_13']	餘欲界繫一切隨眠，與上相違皆是不善。	餘欲界繫一切隨眠，與上相違皆是不善。	The remaining proclivities bound to the desire realm, in contrast to the above, are all unwholesome.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b06_12']	於此不善諸隨眠中，有幾能為不善根體？	於此不善諸隨眠中，有幾能為不善根體？	Among these unwholesome latent afflictions, how many can be the substance of unwholesome roots?

['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b07_13']	不善根欲界，　　貪瞋不善癡。	不善根欲界，　　貪瞋不善癡。	The unwholesome roots are desire, greed, anger, and unwholesome delusion.

['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b09_1']	唯欲界繫一切貪瞋及不善癡不善根攝。	唯欲界繫一切貪瞋及不善癡不善根攝。	Only the greed, anger, and unwholesome delusion belonging to the desire realm are categorized as unwholesome roots.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b09_19']	如其次第，世尊說為貪瞋癡三不善根體。	如其次第，世尊說為貪瞋癡三不善根體。	The World-Honored One has respectively taught them as the substance of the three unwholesome roots of greed, anger, and delusion.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b10_15']	唯不善煩惱為不善法根，名不善根。	唯不善煩惱為不善法根，名不善根。	Only the unwholesome afflictions are the roots of unwholesome dharmas, and are therefore called unwholesome roots.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b11_1']	宗義如是。	宗義如是。	This is the meaning of the treatise.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b12_17']	豈不一切已生惡法皆為後因，非唯三種無越二理，以不善根翻對善根而建立故。	豈不一切已生惡法皆為後因，非唯三種無越二理，以不善根翻對善根而建立故。	Aren't all previously arisen unwholesome dharmas causes for later ones? They are not only the three kinds. There is no transgression of the two principles, because the unwholesome roots are established as opposites to the wholesome roots.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b13_9']	何緣不建立不慢等善根？	何緣不建立不慢等善根？	Why are the wholesome roots of non-arrogance, etc. not established?
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b14_4']	五識身中無惡慢等可翻對故。	五識身中無惡慢等可翻對故。	Because there is no arrogance, etc. in the group of five consciousnesses that can be opposed.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b16_2']	又具五義立不善根，謂通五部遍依六識，是隨眠性發惡身語，斷善根時為勝加行。	又具五義立不善根，謂通五部遍依六識，是隨眠性發惡身語，斷善根時為勝加行。	Also, the five meanings are complete in the case of the roots of demerit. That is, they are found in the five classes of action, they are supported by the six consciousnesses, they are the nature of propensities, they give rise to evil bodily and vocal action, and they are the superior impulsion in the severing of good roots.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b16_7']	慢等不爾。	慢等不爾。	Pride and so forth are not like this.

['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b20_13']	中愛見慢癡，　　三定皆癡故。	中愛見慢癡，　　三定皆癡故。	In the middle, craving, views, pride, and delusion. In the three concentrations, all are delusion.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b21_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The Commentary explains:
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b23_2']	迦濕彌羅國諸毘婆沙師說，無記根亦有三種，謂諸無記愛、癡、慧三，一切應知無記根攝。	迦濕彌羅國諸毘婆沙師說，無記根亦有三種，謂諸無記愛、癡、慧三，一切應知無記根攝。	The Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr say that indeterminate roots are also of three kinds, namely, indeterminate craving, delusion, and discernment. All should be understood as included in the indeterminate roots.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b23_11']	慧根通攝有覆無覆。	慧根通攝有覆無覆。	The root of discernment is included in both the obscured and the non-obscured.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b24_12']	根是因義，無覆無記慧亦能為因，故無記根攝。	根是因義，無覆無記慧亦能為因，故無記根攝。	The meaning of root is that of cause. Non-obscured indeterminate discernment is also able to be a cause, and therefore it is included in the indeterminate roots.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b25_2']	此三有力生諸無記。	此三有力生諸無記。	These three are powerful and generate all indeterminate dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b25_11']	何緣疑慢非無記根？	何緣疑慢非無記根？	Why are doubt and pride not indeterminate roots?
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b26_1']	疑二趣轉，慢高轉故。	疑二趣轉，慢高轉故。	Because doubt and pride turn in two ways and turn upward, respectively.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b26_20']	謂疑猶豫二趣動轉，故不立根，根堅住故。	謂疑猶豫二趣動轉，故不立根，根堅住故。	That is, doubt vacillates and turns in two directions, and therefore it is not established as a root, because a root is firmly established.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b27_18']	慢高舉相向上而轉，故不立根，根趣下故。	慢高舉相向上而轉，故不立根，根趣下故。	Pride turns upward, with its characteristics of arrogance and haughtiness, and therefore it is not established as a root, because a root tends downward.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0899b29_6']	世間共見根相如是，隱於土下故名為根，是體下垂上生苗義。	世間共見根相如是，隱於土下故名為根，是體下垂上生苗義。	The world commonly sees the characteristics of roots in this way. Because they are hidden under the earth, they are called roots, and their nature is to extend downward and produce sprouts upward.

['ZH_T29_1563_026:0902b25_6']	且欲界繫見苦斷法為自界三，識所緣者，謂欲見苦所斷一切及欲見集所斷遍行，欲修所斷善無記識，色修所斷善識非餘。	且欲界繫見苦斷法為自界三，識所緣者，謂欲見苦所斷一切及欲見集所斷遍行，欲修所斷善無記識，色修所斷善識非餘。	The dharmas of the realm of desire that are to be eliminated by insight into the truth of suffering are the objects of the three consciousnesses of the realm of desire, namely, all those of the realm of desire that are to be eliminated by insight into the truths of suffering and of the origin of suffering, and the universally engerizing passions of the realm of desire that are to be eliminated by insight into the truth of the origin of suffering, and the good and indeterminate consciousnesses to be eliminated by cultivation of the realm of desire. The good consciousness to be eliminated by cultivation of the realm of form is not so, and the others are not.

It should be understood that the dharmas eliminated by seeing cessation and by seeing the truth of the path are each increased by their own consciousness as an object.

Eighty are as above, and each increases its own consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1563_026:0902c12_1']	若無漏法為十識緣，謂三界中各後三部，即見滅道修所斷識，無漏第十，皆容緣故。	若無漏法為十識緣，謂三界中各後三部，即見滅道修所斷識，無漏第十，皆容緣故。	If pure dharmas are the objects of the ten consciousnesses, then the last three classes of dharmas in the three realms, i.e., those eliminated by the paths of insight into the truths of cessation and path and by the path of cultivation, and pure dharmas as the tenth, are all capable of being their objects.

However, the companions and objects are remote in relation to the power of the antidote, and therefore the name is established on the basis of nonelimination.
