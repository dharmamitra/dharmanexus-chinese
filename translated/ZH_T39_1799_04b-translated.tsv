['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c06_7']	一、俱盡滅生顯無功用。	一、俱盡滅生顯無功用。	First, the complete exhaustion of arising and ceasing manifests the path of no-effort.

It is just arising and ceasing, not the arising of enlightenment;
['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c10_9']	無生滅滅，方無功用。	無生滅滅，方無功用。	without the ceasing of arising and ceasing, there is no effortlessness.

Therefore, bodhisattvas are always aware but do not dwell. Illumination and the illuminator simultaneously cease.
['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c12_18']	」此顯地上證無生理，得無功用也。	」此顯地上證無生理，得無功用也。	This manifests the realization of the principle of non-arising on the grounds, and attaining the path of no-effort.

This is also born and extinguished. That which is neither born nor extinguished is called spontaneity. If my teaching has spontaneity, how can it be called spontaneity while still having birth and extinction?
['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c17_17']	今汝所明自然心生、生滅心滅，此亦生滅，何名自然？	今汝所明自然心生、生滅心滅，此亦生滅，何名自然？	Now, what you clarify is that the spontaneously born mind arises and the born and extinguished mind ceases. This is also born and extinguished. How can it be called spontaneity?
['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c18_16']	夫自然者必無生滅，故云無生滅者名為自然。	夫自然者必無生滅，故云無生滅者名為自然。	After all, spontaneity must be neither born nor extinguished. Therefore, it is said that that which is neither born nor extinguished is called spontaneity.

That which is not a combination is called the nature of original spontaneity. This uses the shallow to illustrate the profound.
['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c23_16']	世間人說生滅和合名和合性，非和合者則無生滅方名自然，豈況我教有生滅者却名自然？	世間人說生滅和合名和合性，非和合者則無生滅方名自然，豈況我教有生滅者却名自然？	People in the world say that birth and extinction combined is the nature of combination. That which is not a combination is then without birth and extinction, which is called spontaneity. How much more so in my teaching, where that which has birth and extinction is called spontaneity?
['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c25_15']	古人於此不言縱立認真自然，斯則不唯增戲論心，反令圓文成外道教，焉敢聞命！	古人於此不言縱立認真自然，斯則不唯增戲論心，反令圓文成外道教，焉敢聞命！	The ancients did not speak of this, even if they established it as true nature, it would naturally be nothing but increasing the mind of conceptual proliferation, and would make the perfect text become the teaching of non-Buddhists. How dare I listen to it?
['ZH_T39_1799_04b:0882c26_6']	三、雙非二離正示忘情。	三、雙非二離正示忘情。	Third, the double negation of the two separations correctly demonstrates forgetting emotions.

You cannot attain them through diligently cultivating and realizing them for eons. Although you may remember the twelve divisions of the scriptures of the Tathagatas of the ten directions, and the pure and wondrous principles as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River, it will only increase idle discourse.
