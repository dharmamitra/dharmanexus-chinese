['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b11_0']	說有四種緣，　　因緣五因性，	說有四種緣，　　因緣五因性，	It is said there are four kinds of conditions, the causal condition has the nature of five causes,
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b12_0']	等無間非後，　　心心所已生，	等無間非後，　　心心所已生，	The immediately preceding is not after, the mind and mental factors have already arisen,
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b13_13']	所緣一切法，　　增上即能作。	所緣一切法，　　增上即能作。	The object is all dharmas, the dominant is the able to act.

['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b14_7']	於何處說？	於何處說？	Where is it said?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b14_12']	謂契經中。	謂契經中。	It is said in the sūtras.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b16_2']	如契經中說四緣性，謂因緣性、等無間緣性、所緣緣性、增上緣性。	如契經中說四緣性，謂因緣性、等無間緣性、所緣緣性、增上緣性。	It is said in the sūtras that there are four kinds of conditional natures, namely the causal condition, the immediately preceding condition, the object condition, and the dominant condition.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b16_11']	此中性者是緣種類。	此中性者是緣種類。	Here, nature refers to the type of condition.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b17_11']	於六因內除能作因，所餘五因是因緣性。	於六因內除能作因，所餘五因是因緣性。	Among the six causes, excluding the efficient cause, the remaining five causes are the causal condition.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b19_5']	除阿羅漢臨涅槃時最後心心所法，諸餘已生心心所法是等無間緣性。	除阿羅漢臨涅槃時最後心心所法，諸餘已生心心所法是等無間緣性。	Except for the last mind and mental factors of an arhat at the time of entering nirvāṇa, all other arisen mind and mental factors are the immediately preceding condition.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b20_4']	此緣生法等而無間，依是義立等無間名。	此緣生法等而無間，依是義立等無間名。	The meaning of the term “similar and immediately antecedent condition” is established on the basis of this principle of dependent origination, namely, that these dharmas of dependent origination are similar and without interval.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b21_4']	由此色等皆不可立等無間緣，不等生故。	由此色等皆不可立等無間緣，不等生故。	For this reason, form, etc., cannot be established as similar and immediately antecedent conditions, because they are not born in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b22_17']	謂欲界色或無間生欲界色界二無表色，或無間生欲界無漏二無表色。	謂欲界色或無間生欲界色界二無表色，或無間生欲界無漏二無表色。	That is, form of the realm of desire is sometimes immediately followed by the arising of two kinds of form of the realm of desire and the realm of form, or it is immediately followed by the arising of two kinds of pure form of the realm of desire.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b24_6']	以諸色法雜亂現前，等無間緣生無雜亂，故色不立等無間緣。	以諸色法雜亂現前，等無間緣生無雜亂，故色不立等無間緣。	Because the manifestation of form dharmas is confused, and the similar and immediately antecedent condition is not confused, therefore form is not established as a similar and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b24_15']	尊者世友作如是言：	尊者世友作如是言：	Bhadanta Vasumitra says that
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b26_16']	於一身中一長養色相續不斷，復有第二長養色生，不相違害，故不可立等無間緣。	於一身中一長養色相續不斷，復有第二長養色生，不相違害，故不可立等無間緣。	in a single body, the continuity of one kind of form that is nourished is not interrupted, and there is a second kind of form that is nourished that is born, and they do not conflict with each other, and therefore they cannot be established as similar and immediately antecedent conditions.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b27_2']	大德復言：	大德復言：	The Bhadanta says that
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036b28_14']	以諸色法無間生起或少或多，謂或有時從多生少，如燒稻稈大聚為灰。	以諸色法無間生起或少或多，謂或有時從多生少，如燒稻稈大聚為灰。	the arising of form dharmas without interval is sometimes small and sometimes large. That is, sometimes many are born from a small number, as when a large mass of rice stalks is burned and reduced to ashes.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c01_15']	或時復有從少生多，如細種生諾瞿陀樹，根莖枝葉漸次增榮，聳幹垂條多所蔭映。	或時復有從少生多，如細種生諾瞿陀樹，根莖枝葉漸次增榮，聳幹垂條多所蔭映。	Sometimes there is also birth of many from few, as when a small seed produces a nyagrodha tree, with its roots, trunk, branches, and leaves gradually increasing and flourishing, with its trunk rising and its branches hanging down, shading a great many things.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c02_14']	豈不心所無間生時亦有少多品類非等？	豈不心所無間生時亦有少多品類非等？	Isn't it the case that when mental activities are born without interval, there are also few and many kinds that are not equal?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c06_4', 'ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c06_17']	謂善不善無記心中，有尋有伺三摩地等，此於異類實有少多，然自類中無非等義，謂無少受無間生多，或復從多無間生少，想等亦爾，無非等過。🔽豈唯自類前能為後等無間緣？	謂善不善無記心中，有尋有伺三摩地等，此於異類實有少多，然自類中無非等義，謂無少受無間生多，或復從多無間生少，想等亦爾，無非等過。 豈唯自類前能為後等無間緣？	That is, in good, bad, and indeterminate minds, there are applied thought, sustained thought, samādhi, etc. Although there are indeed few and many in different kinds, there is no meaning of inequality within the same kind. That is, there is no birth of many from few without interval, or birth of few from many without interval. Ideas, etc. are also like this, with no error of inequality.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c07_2']	不爾。	不爾。	Isn't it only the same kind that can be the immediately antecedent condition for the subsequent?🔽No.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c07_5']	云何？	云何？	How is it?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c08_4']	前心品法總為後品等無間緣，非唯自類。	前心品法總為後品等無間緣，非唯自類。	The dharmas of the preceding class of mind are generally the immediately antecedent condition for the subsequent class, not only of the same kind.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c09_4']	且於受等自體類中無少生多，以說等義。	且於受等自體類中無少生多，以說等義。	As for the same kind of feeling, etc., there is no birth of many from few, because it is said to be equal.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c10_19']	唯執同類相續者說，唯自類有等無間緣，心唯生心、受唯生受，乃至廣說。	唯執同類相續者說，唯自類有等無間緣，心唯生心、受唯生受，乃至廣說。	This is said by those who maintain that only similar and immediately antecedent dharmas are conditions as the equivalent and immediate antecedent. Mind only produces mind, feeling only produces feeling, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c12_8']	若從無染無間染生，此染心中所有煩惱，用先滅煩惱為等無間緣。	若從無染無間染生，此染心中所有煩惱，用先滅煩惱為等無間緣。	If immediately after a nondefiled state a defiled state arises, the defilements present in this defiled state take as their condition as the equivalent and immediate antecedent the defilements that have just ceased.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c13_11']	如出滅定，心還用先滅正入滅定，心為緣故起。	如出滅定，心還用先滅正入滅定，心為緣故起。	This is like the case of emerging from the concentration of cessation, where the mind that has just ceased when one enters the concentration of cessation is the condition for the arising of the mind that emerges from the concentration of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c14_10']	彼說非善，初無漏心應闕此緣而得生故。	彼說非善，初無漏心應闕此緣而得生故。	This explanation is not good, because the first pure mind would lack this condition and be able to be born.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c15_13']	不相應行亦如諸色雜亂現前，故非等無間緣。	不相應行亦如諸色雜亂現前，故非等無間緣。	Nonassociated dharmas are also like form, in that they are confused and present. Therefore they are not conditions as the equivalent and immediate antecedent.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c17_1']	三界及不繫可俱現前故，何緣不許未來世有等無間緣？	三界及不繫可俱現前故，何緣不許未來世有等無間緣？	The three realms and the unconditioned can be present simultaneously. Why do you not admit that conditions as the equivalent and immediate antecedent exist in the future?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c17_14']	以未來法雜亂而住無前後故。	以未來法雜亂而住無前後故。	Because future dharmas are confused and do not have a sequence of prior and posterior.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c18_14']	如何世尊知未來世此法無間、此法應生？	如何世尊知未來世此法無間、此法應生？	How does the World Honored One know that this dharma immediately after that dharma should be born in the future?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c19_5']	比過現法而現知故。	比過現法而現知故。	He knows this through inference from dharmas of the present and past.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c20_14']	傳說世尊見從過去如此類業此類果生，是法無間生如是法。	傳說世尊見從過去如此類業此類果生，是法無間生如是法。	The Buddha saw that from such and such past actions such and such results were born, and that such and such dharmas are born immediately after such dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c22_1']	又從現在如此類業此類果生，是法無間生如是法。	又從現在如此類業此類果生，是法無間生如是法。	Also, from such and such present actions such and such results are born, and that such and such dharmas are born immediately after such and such dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c23_9']	如是見已，便於未來諸亂住法，能正了達此法無間此法應生。	如是見已，便於未來諸亂住法，能正了達此法無間此法應生。	Having seen this, he then correctly understood that from such and such dharmas in the future such and such dharmas are born immediately after them.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c24_1']	雖如是知而非比智。	雖如是知而非比智。	Even though he knows this, it is not inferential knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c26_17']	由佛比類過去現在因果次第，便於未來亂住諸法能現了達，謂未來世如是有情造如是業招如是果，是願智攝故非比智。	由佛比類過去現在因果次第，便於未來亂住諸法能現了達，謂未來世如是有情造如是業招如是果，是願智攝故非比智。	Because the Buddha infers the sequence of causes and effects in the past and present, he is able to understand clearly the dharmas in the future that are not in a state of immediate sequence. He knows that in the future such and such sentient beings will create such and such actions and attract such and such results. This is knowledge of vows and therefore not inferential knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c27_18']	若爾，世尊未見前際，於後際法應不能知。	若爾，世尊未見前際，於後際法應不能知。	If this is so, then the Buddha, not having seen the prior limit, would be unable to know dharmas of the later limit.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c28_4']	有餘復言：	有餘復言：	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0036c29_7']	有情身內有未來世果因先兆，是不相應行蘊差別。	有情身內有未來世果因先兆，是不相應行蘊差別。	In the body of sentient beings there is a prior indication of the cause of future results. This is a species of the aggregate of mental dharmas that are not associated with mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a01_7']	佛唯觀此便知未來，非要現遊靜慮通慧。	佛唯觀此便知未來，非要現遊靜慮通慧。	The Buddha observes only this and then knows the future, not necessarily by means of the samādhi of the supernormal knowledge of the present.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a02_8']	若爾，諸佛便於未來占相故知，非為現證。	若爾，諸佛便於未來占相故知，非為現證。	If this is so, then the buddhas would know the future by divination, not by direct perception.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a03_11']	故如經部諸師所言，世尊舉意遍知諸法非比非占。	故如經部諸師所言，世尊舉意遍知諸法非比非占。	Therefore, as the masters of the Sautrāntika school say, the World-Honored One knows all dharmas by raising his mind, not by inference or divination.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a03_16']	此說為善。	此說為善。	This explanation is good.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a04_4']	如世尊說：	如世尊說：	As the World-Honored One said:
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a04_18']	諸佛德用、諸佛境界不可思議。	諸佛德用、諸佛境界不可思議。	The virtues and functions of the buddhas, and the realm of the buddhas, are inconceivable.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a06_15']	若於未來無定前後次第安立，何故但言世第一法無間唯生苦法智忍不生餘法？	若於未來無定前後次第安立，何故但言世第一法無間唯生苦法智忍不生餘法？	If there is no definite sequential arrangement of past, present, and future, then why is it said that only the supreme worldly dharmas immediately give rise to the forbearance of the dharma of suffering, and not other dharmas?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a08_3']	如是廣說，乃至金剛喻定無間，唯生盡智不生餘法。	如是廣說，乃至金剛喻定無間，唯生盡智不生餘法。	In this way, it is explained in detail up to the vajra-like samādhi immediately giving rise to the knowledge of exhaustion, and not other dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a09_12']	若此法生繫屬彼法，要彼無間此乃得生，如芽等生要藉種等。	若此法生繫屬彼法，要彼無間此乃得生，如芽等生要藉種等。	If the arising of this dharma is dependent on that dharma, then it can only arise immediately after that, just as sprouts and so forth arise only by relying on seeds and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a10_3']	然此非有等無間緣。	然此非有等無間緣。	However, this does not have an equal and immediately antecedent condition.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a11_4']	諸阿羅漢最後心心所，何緣故說非等無間緣？	諸阿羅漢最後心心所，何緣故說非等無間緣？	Why is it said that the final mind and mental activities of arhats are not conditions as cause?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a11_13']	無餘心等續此起故。	無餘心等續此起故。	Because no other mind or mental activities arise in a series from them.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a12_8', 'ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a13_14']	豈不如是無間滅心亦名為意？🔽後心無間識既不生應不名意，意是依所顯非作用所顯。	豈不如是無間滅心亦名為意？ 後心無間識既不生應不名意，意是依所顯非作用所顯。	Why is the mind that has just ceased not called manas?🔽Because the subsequent mind does not arise from it. Manas is revealed as a support, not as a function.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a15_4']	此最後心有所依義，餘緣闕故後識不生，等無間緣作用所顯。	此最後心有所依義，餘緣闕故後識不生，等無間緣作用所顯。	The final mind has the meaning of a support, but a subsequent mind does not arise because other conditions are lacking. The condition as cause is revealed as a function.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a17_12']	若法此緣取為果已，定無諸法及諸有情能為障礙令彼不起，故最後心雖得名意，而不可說等無間緣。	若法此緣取為果已，定無諸法及諸有情能為障礙令彼不起，故最後心雖得名意，而不可說等無間緣。	If a dharma is grasped as a result by this condition, then no dharma or sentient being can obstruct it and prevent its arising. Therefore, although the final mind is called manas, it cannot be said to be a condition as cause.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a18_13']	若法與心為等無間，彼法亦是心無間耶？	若法與心為等無間，彼法亦是心無間耶？	If a dharma is a condition as the equivalent and immediate antecedent for mind, is it also an antecedent of mind?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a18_18']	應作四句。	應作四句。	Four sentences are possible.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a20_3']	第一句者，謂無心定出心心所，及第二等二定剎那。	第一句者，謂無心定出心心所，及第二等二定剎那。	The first is the mind and mental activities that emerge from the two mindless samādhis and the second moment of the two samādhis.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a21_10']	第二句者，謂初所起二定剎那，及有心位諸心心所生住異滅。	第二句者，謂初所起二定剎那，及有心位諸心心所生住異滅。	The second phrase refers to the arising, abiding, and cessation of the first moment of the two meditative attainments and of the mind and mental factors in the state with mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a22_14']	第三句者，謂初所起二定剎那，及有心位心心所法。	第三句者，謂初所起二定剎那，及有心位心心所法。	The third phrase refers to the first moment of the two meditative attainments and the mind and mental factors in the state with mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a24_3']	第四句者，謂第二等二定剎那，及無心定出心心所生住異滅。	第四句者，謂第二等二定剎那，及無心定出心心所生住異滅。	The fourth phrase refers to the second moment of the two meditative attainments and the arising, abiding, and cessation of the mind and mental factors upon emerging from the attainment without mind.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a25_3']	若法與心為等無間，與無心定為無間耶？	若法與心為等無間，與無心定為無間耶？	If a dharma is a similar and immediately antecedent condition for mind, is it also an immediately antecedent condition for the attainment without mind?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a25_8']	應作四句。	應作四句。	Four sentences should be made.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a27_2']	謂前第三第四句為今第一第二句，即前第一第二句為今第三第四句。	謂前第三第四句為今第一第二句，即前第一第二句為今第三第四句。	That is, the third and fourth sentences of the previous [analysis] are the first and second sentences of the present [analysis], and the first and second sentences of the previous [analysis] are the third and fourth sentences of the present [analysis].
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a28_11']	從二定出諸心心所，望入定心中間遠隔，如何為彼等無間耶？	從二定出諸心心所，望入定心中間遠隔，如何為彼等無間耶？	The mind and mental factors upon emerging from the two meditative attainments are separated by a long interval from the mind entering the meditative attainment. How can they be the similar and immediately antecedent condition for that [mind]?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a29_2']	中間不隔心心所故。	中間不隔心心所故。	Because they are not separated by any mind or mental factors in the interval.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037a29_11']	如是已釋等無間緣。	如是已釋等無間緣。	Thus the similar and immediately antecedent condition has been explained.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b01_11']	所緣緣性，即一切法望心心所，隨其所應。	所緣緣性，即一切法望心心所，隨其所應。	The nature of the condition as object is that all dharmas are the condition as object for mind and mental activities, according to the case.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b02_11']	謂如眼識及相應法，以一切色為所緣緣。	謂如眼識及相應法，以一切色為所緣緣。	That is, eye consciousness and mental activities take all forms as the condition as object.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b03_7', 'ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b03_16']	如是耳識及相應法，以一切聲。🔽鼻識相應以一切香。	如是耳識及相應法，以一切聲。 鼻識相應以一切香。	In the same way, ear consciousness and mental activities take all sounds.🔽Nose consciousness and mental activities take all smells.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b04_6']	舌識相應以一切味。	舌識相應以一切味。	Tongue consciousness and mental activities take all tastes.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b04_15']	身識相應以一切觸。	身識相應以一切觸。	Body consciousness and mental activities take all tangibles.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b05_9']	意識相應以一切法為所緣緣。	意識相應以一切法為所緣緣。	Mental consciousness and mental activities take all dharmas as the condition as object.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b07_11']	若法與彼法為所緣，無時此與彼非所緣，於不緣位亦所緣攝，被緣、不緣其相一故。	若法與彼法為所緣，無時此與彼非所緣，於不緣位亦所緣攝，被緣、不緣其相一故。	When a dharma is the object of another dharma, it is never not the condition as object for it. Even in a state when it is not being perceived, it is still categorized as the condition as object, because the nature of the object is the same whether it is being perceived or not.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b08_10']	譬如薪等，於不燒時亦名所燒，相無異故。	譬如薪等，於不燒時亦名所燒，相無異故。	It is like fuel, etc., which, even when not burning, is still called combustible, because its nature is the same.
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b10_3']	心心所法如於所緣處、事、剎那三皆決定，於所依亦有如是決定耶？	心心所法如於所緣處、事、剎那三皆決定，於所依亦有如是決定耶？	Are mind and its activities as definitely determined in regard to their support as they are in regard to their objects, locations, and moments?
['ZH_T29_1558_007:0037b11_15']	應言亦有如是決定，然於現在親附自所依，過去未來與所依相離。	應言亦有如是決定，然於現在親附自所依，過去未來與所依相離。	It should be said that there is also such a determination, but in the present it is closely related to its own support, while in the past and future it is separated from its support.
