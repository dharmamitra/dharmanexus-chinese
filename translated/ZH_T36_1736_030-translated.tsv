['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b08_10']	故今答云：	故今答云：	030	Therefore the answer now is:
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b08_15']	通性相故。	通性相故。	030	Because it penetrates both nature and characteristics.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b10_4']	唯見相者即是有邊、唯見性者即墮無邊，性相無礙故離二邊。	唯見相者即是有邊、唯見性者即墮無邊，性相無礙故離二邊。	030	Only seeing characteristics falls into the extreme of existence, only seeing nature falls into the extreme of nonexistence. Because nature and characteristics are unobstructed, one is free from the two extremes.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b11_1']	《中論》云「雖空而不斷，雖有而不常。	《中論》云「雖空而不斷，雖有而不常。	030	The Zhong lun says Although empty, it is not severed. Although existent, it is not permanent.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b11_13']	」即由空有相即離二邊也。	」即由空有相即離二邊也。	030	This is precisely because emptiness and existence are mutually inclusive that one is free from the two extremes.

['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b14_13']	然二諦之義玄中已明，欲釋此疏略申四義：	然二諦之義玄中已明，欲釋此疏略申四義：	030	However, the meaning of the two truths has already been clarified in the profound treatise. In order to explain this commentary, I will briefly present four meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b16_7']	謂或說妄空真有，如《涅槃》云「空者所謂生死，不空者所謂大般涅槃。	謂或說妄空真有，如《涅槃》云「空者所謂生死，不空者所謂大般涅槃。	030	It is said that false emptiness and true existence, as the Nirvana Sutra says: Emptiness refers to birth and death, and non-emptiness refers to the great parinirvana.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b17_1']	」二者妄有真空，即是今文。	」二者妄有真空，即是今文。	030	Second, false existence and true emptiness, which is precisely the meaning of this text.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b17_11']	三俱空，相待無性故。	三俱空，相待無性故。	030	Third, both are empty, because there is no nature in mutual dependence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b18_8']	四俱有，性相不壞故，於諦常自二故。	四俱有，性相不壞故，於諦常自二故。	030	Fourth, both exist, because nature and characteristics are not destroyed, and the two truths are always distinct from each other.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b19_6']	今此正當第二俗有真空義，而有四對：	今此正當第二俗有真空義，而有四對：	030	This is precisely the second meaning of conventional existence and true emptiness, and there are four pairs:
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b19_14']	初對定有無所在。	初對定有無所在。	030	The first pair determines where existence and non-existence are located.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b20_16']	我約真諦上說空，是無性空，不同無物空也；	我約真諦上說空，是無性空，不同無物空也；	030	I discuss emptiness based on the highest truth, which is the emptiness of nature, not the same as the emptiness of nothingness;
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b21_18']	我就俗諦明其有，此是緣有，非定性之有也。	我就俗諦明其有，此是緣有，非定性之有也。	030	I explain from the conventional truth that it exists, this is conditioned existence, not definite inherent existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b22_11']	二真故無有，則雖無而有。	二真故無有，則雖無而有。	030	Second, because of truth, there is no existence, so although non-existent, it exists.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b23_18']	下一對彰有無體相是不壞有之無、不礙無之有，故成中道。	下一對彰有無體相是不壞有之無、不礙無之有，故成中道。	030	The next pair clarifies the essence and characteristics of existence and non-existence, which is the non-annihilation of existence in non-existence, and the non-obstruction of non-existence in existence, thus forming the middle way.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b24_19']	三「雖有而無則不累於有」下，彰有無之德。	三「雖有而無則不累於有」下，彰有無之德。	030	The third, Although existent, it is non-existent, thus not accumulating in existence, clarifies the virtues of existence and non-existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b25_17']	若是定性之有，此有則唯是有，不得即無；	若是定性之有，此有則唯是有，不得即無；	030	If it is definite inherent existence, this existence is only existence, and cannot be non-existence;
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b26_17']	若是定性之無，此無則唯是無，不得即有。	若是定性之無，此無則唯是無，不得即有。	030	If it is definite inherent non-existence, this non-existence is only non-existence, and cannot be existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b27_10']	今二互相即，故不偏滯。	今二互相即，故不偏滯。	030	Now the two mutually include each other, thus not biased or obstructed.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b29_7']	四「不滯於無」下一對，彰有無離過，滯空則斷、累有則常，既不滯不累，故無斷常。	四「不滯於無」下一對，彰有無離過，滯空則斷、累有則常，既不滯不累，故無斷常。	030	The fourth pair, Not obstructed in non-existence, clarifies the transcendence of faults in existence and non-existence. Being obstructed in emptiness is annihilation, and accumulating in existence is permanence. Since it is neither obstructed nor accumulated, thus there is neither annihilation nor permanence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225b29_10']	又釋：	又釋：	030	Another explanation:
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c01_9']	初對雙離有無，故云無有無無，此成空觀。	初對雙離有無，故云無有無無，此成空觀。	030	The first pair both transcends existence and non-existence, thus it says no existence and no non-existence, which forms the contemplation of emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c02_15']	第二對不壞有無，故云雖有而無、雖無而有，此成假觀。	第二對不壞有無，故云雖有而無、雖無而有，此成假觀。	030	The second pair is about the indestructibility of existence and non-existence, thus saying although existing, it is non-existent; although non-existent, it exists, which accomplishes the contemplation of the provisional.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c04_13']	第三對明二諦相即故，不偏滯有無故，不為有邊所動、無邊所寂，成中道觀。	第三對明二諦相即故，不偏滯有無故，不為有邊所動、無邊所寂，成中道觀。	030	The third pair clarifies the mutual inclusion of the two truths, thus not being biased towards existence or non-existence, not being moved by the extreme of existence or quieted by the extreme of non-existence, accomplishing the contemplation of the middle way.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c04_18']	肇公亦云：	肇公亦云：	030	Master Sengzhao also said:
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c06_2']	「涉有未始迷虛，故常處有而不染」，此不累有也；	「涉有未始迷虛，故常處有而不染」，此不累有也；	030	Engaging with existence, one never becomes confused about emptiness, thus always abiding in existence without being tainted, which does not accumulate existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c07_5']	「不厭有而觀虛，故觀虛而不證」，此不滯於無也。	「不厭有而觀虛，故觀虛而不證」，此不滯於無也。	030	Not being averse to existence while contemplating emptiness, thus contemplating emptiness without realizing it, which does not become stuck in non-existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c07_15']	第四離過，準前有釋。	第四離過，準前有釋。	030	The fourth pair is about avoiding faults, as explained before.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c09_1']	初對中初句云真故無有，無彼定性之有，是真空義；	初對中初句云真故無有，無彼定性之有，是真空義；	030	In the first pair, the first sentence says because it is true, it does not exist, not having that definite nature of existence, which is the meaning of true emptiness;
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c10_2']	次句俗故無無，無彼斷滅之無，故是妙有義。	次句俗故無無，無彼斷滅之無，故是妙有義。	030	The next sentence says because it is conventional, non-existence does not exist, not having that annihilationist non-existence, thus being the meaning of wondrous existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c10_11']	第二對亦有亦無義。	第二對亦有亦無義。	030	The second pair has the meaning of both existence and non-existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c11_2']	第三對非有非無義。	第三對非有非無義。	030	The third pair has the meaning of neither existence nor non-existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c11_15']	第四對離過則成具德四句也。	第四對離過則成具德四句也。	030	The fourth pair is about the four statements of perfection through detachment from faults.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c12_12']	又初對雙離二過，一離有、二離無；	又初對雙離二過，一離有、二離無；	030	Moreover, the first pair is about detaching from both faults, first detaching from existence and second detaching from non-existence;
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c13_2']	第二對離非有非無；	第二對離非有非無；	030	the second pair is about detaching from neither existence nor non-existence;
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c13_11']	第三對離亦有亦無；	第三對離亦有亦無；	030	the third pair is about detaching from both existence and non-existence;
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c14_1']	第四對總明離過。	第四對總明離過。	030	the fourth pair is about generally clarifying detachment from faults.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c15_17']	故《起信》云「真如非有相、非無相、非非有相非非無相、非有無俱相」，即斯義也。	故《起信》云「真如非有相、非無相、非非有相非非無相、非有無俱相」，即斯義也。	030	Therefore, the Awakening of Faith says, Suchness is not a characteristic of existence, not a characteristic of non-existence, not a characteristic of neither existence nor non-existence, not a characteristic of both existence and non-existence together, which is precisely this meaning.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c17_1']	是以結云「俱不俱等何由而有」，謂第四對正離斷常。	是以結云「俱不俱等何由而有」，謂第四對正離斷常。	030	Therefore, it concludes, How can there be both existence and non-existence, etc.? This means that the fourth pair correctly detaches from annihilation and permanence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c17_13']	第三對不偏滯故離於俱句。	第三對不偏滯故離於俱句。	030	The third pair does not stubbornly adhere to one side, so it detaches from the statement of both.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c18_12']	第二句不壞二故離於雙非，故俱寂也。	第二句不壞二故離於雙非，故俱寂也。	030	The second pair does not destroy the two, so it detaches from the double negation, thus both are quiescent.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c21_9']	又若有二可得名俱，今有即無故則有外無無可與有俱，今無即有故則無外無有可與無俱，故亦有亦無相違不立。	又若有二可得名俱，今有即無故則有外無無可與有俱，今無即有故則無外無有可與無俱，故亦有亦無相違不立。	030	Moreover, if there were two [extremes], they could be called simultaneous. But now existence is nonexistence, so there is no external nonexistence that can be simultaneous with existence. Now nonexistence is existence, so there is no external existence that can be simultaneous with nonexistence. Therefore, existence and nonexistence are contradictory and cannot be established.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c22_13']	言不俱不立者，若定有定無，遮彼有無有俱非句。	言不俱不立者，若定有定無，遮彼有無有俱非句。	030	As for not established as simultaneous or not, if there is definite existence or definite nonexistence, then existence and nonexistence are mutually exclusive and there is no third alternative.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c23_4']	今有即無，何有非無？	今有即無，何有非無？	030	But now existence is nonexistence, so how can there be nonexistence?
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c23_14']	今無即有，何有非有？	今無即有，何有非有？	030	Now nonexistence is existence, so how can there be existence?
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c24_1']	故雙非亦寂。	故雙非亦寂。	030	Therefore, the double negation is also quiescent.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c25_6']	既無有無，亦無一異、斷常、來去，靡不皆如，故云都寂。	既無有無，亦無一異、斷常、來去，靡不皆如，故云都寂。	030	Since there is neither existence nor nonexistence, there is also neither identity nor difference, neither annihilation nor permanence, neither coming nor going. All are thus, so it is said to be completely quiescent.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c26_11']	是以經言「二邊皆捨離」，皆捨離者，一切二邊非局有無。	是以經言「二邊皆捨離」，皆捨離者，一切二邊非局有無。	030	Therefore, the sutra says, Abandon both extremes. Abandon both means all dualistic extremes, not just existence and nonexistence.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c28_3']	又言離者，性自離故、不取著故、了真性故，非有諸邊可捨離也。	又言離者，性自離故、不取著故、了真性故，非有諸邊可捨離也。	030	Moreover, abandon means they are naturally abandoned, not grasped at, and truly realized, not that there are various extremes to be abandoned.
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0225c29_1']	疏「次一慈力降魔」者，《大乘方便經》說：	疏「次一慈力降魔」者，《大乘方便經》說：	030	The commentary states Next, one line is about the power of kindness subduing demons. The Mahāyāna Skillful Means Sūtra says:
['ZH_T36_1736_030:0226a01_3']	波旬兵眾滿三十六由旬，圍菩提樹，欲作留難。	波旬兵眾滿三十六由旬，圍菩提樹，欲作留難。	030	The troops of Pāpīyān filled thirty-six yojanas, surrounding the Bodhi tree, wanting to create obstacles.
