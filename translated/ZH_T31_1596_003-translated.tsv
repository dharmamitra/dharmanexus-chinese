['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c16_10']	云何世間淨不成？	云何世間淨不成？	How is worldly purity not accomplished?
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c17_16']	如未離欲界欲、未得色界心，即以欲界善心修行除欲界欲。	如未離欲界欲、未得色界心，即以欲界善心修行除欲界欲。	If one has not yet abandoned desires of the desire realm and has not yet attained the mind of the form realm, one cultivates with a good mind of the desire realm to abandon desires of the desire realm.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c19_7']	此欲界修行心與色界心，不得俱生俱滅，故無熏習，種子不成。	此欲界修行心與色界心，不得俱生俱滅，故無熏習，種子不成。	This mind of cultivation in the desire realm and the mind of the form realm cannot arise and cease together, so there is no perfuming, and the seeds are not accomplished.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c20_16']	無有色界心，為過去無量生中餘心隔故，彼靜心種子不得成就。	無有色界心，為過去無量生中餘心隔故，彼靜心種子不得成就。	There is no mind of the form realm, because other minds of immeasurable lives in the past are separated by other minds, so the seeds of that tranquil mind cannot be accomplished.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c23_1']	已無有故，是故成就彼色界靜心，由一切種子果報識次第傳來得為因緣，修行善心為增上緣。	已無有故，是故成就彼色界靜心，由一切種子果報識次第傳來得為因緣，修行善心為增上緣。	Since they do not exist, therefore the accomplishment of that tranquil mind of the form realm comes from the causal condition of the consciousness that is the result of the perfuming of all seeds transmitted in sequence, and the mind of cultivated goodness is the dominant condition.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c23_15']	如是一切離欲地，如其相應知。	如是一切離欲地，如其相應知。	In this way, all stages of detachment should be understood according to their characteristics.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c24_14']	如是世間淨，離一切種子果報識亦不成。	如是世間淨，離一切種子果報識亦不成。	Thus, worldly purity is also not established without the consciousness that contains all seeds and is the retribution.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c24_17']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c25_10']	如世間淨不成，今當顯示。	如世間淨不成，今當顯示。	Now, it will be shown how worldly purity is not established.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0280c29_7']	如為離婬欲起修行時，修行欲界善心，於色界心無有熏習，以不同生同滅故，彼色界心即是無種子而生，以彼過去色界心無量生中餘識所隔，已過去無有，不成故。	如為離婬欲起修行時，修行欲界善心，於色界心無有熏習，以不同生同滅故，彼色界心即是無種子而生，以彼過去色界心無量生中餘識所隔，已過去無有，不成故。	When one cultivates practices to abandon sexual desire, the wholesome mind of the desire realm does not have perfuming on the mind of the form realm, because they do not arise and cease together. That mind of the form realm would then arise without seeds, because that past mind of the form realm is separated by countless other consciousnesses in the meantime, and it is not established as nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a01_10']	彼靜心種子為因緣者，從阿梨耶識中自種子生故。	彼靜心種子為因緣者，從阿梨耶識中自種子生故。	The cause for that still mind is the seeds. It arises from its own seeds in the ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a03_8']	彼方便善心非無功力，得為增上緣則為功力，但非因緣，由彼增上故色界心得生。	彼方便善心非無功力，得為增上緣則為功力，但非因緣，由彼增上故色界心得生。	That skillful mind of expedient means is not without efficacy, and can be the dominant condition, thus having efficacy. But it is not the causal condition, because the mind of the form realm can arise due to that dominant condition.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a03_18']	如是破色欲時亦爾故。	如是破色欲時亦爾故。	It is the same when abandoning desire for form.🔽Chapter 15: Supramundane Purity

['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a08_2']	此他音聲及正思惟，為熏耳識、為熏意識、為熏耳意二識？	此他音聲及正思惟，為熏耳識、為熏意識、為熏耳意二識？	Does this sound from others and proper reflection perfume the ear consciousness, the mental consciousness, or both the ear and mental consciousnesses?
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a09_8']	於彼法中起正思時，耳識不生，意識亦為餘識別攀緣所間。	於彼法中起正思時，耳識不生，意識亦為餘識別攀緣所間。	When giving rise to proper reflection on those dharmas, the ear consciousness does not arise, and the mental consciousness is also interrupted by other consciousnesses that grasp other objects.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a11_7']	若於正思惟相應心生時，彼意識久滅過去，聞所熏及熏習皆不得有，何處得種子？	若於正思惟相應心生時，彼意識久滅過去，聞所熏及熏習皆不得有，何處得種子？	When the mind associated with proper reflection arises, that mental consciousness has long ceased and disappeared. There can be no perfuming or being perfumed by hearing. Where can it obtain seeds?
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a14_1']	於後時生正思惟相應心，與正思惟相應者是世間心，與正見相應者是出世間心，無有共生共滅義故，不為彼所熏。	於後時生正思惟相應心，與正思惟相應者是世間心，與正見相應者是出世間心，無有共生共滅義故，不為彼所熏。	Later, when the mind associated with proper reflection arises, the mind associated with proper reflection is a worldly mind, while the mind associated with right view is a supramundane mind. There is no meaning of arising together or ceasing together, so it is not perfumed by them.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a14_13']	既不被熏，則為種子不成。	既不被熏，則為種子不成。	Since it is not perfumed, it cannot be a seed.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a16_5']	是故出世間淨，離一切種子果報識亦不成，彼中攝持聞熏習種不成故。	是故出世間淨，離一切種子果報識亦不成，彼中攝持聞熏習種不成故。	Therefore, supramundane purity is also not established apart from the consciousness that is the result of all seeds, because the seeds of the perfuming of hearing are not included in it.

['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a19_9']	此意識為餘識別攀緣所間者，謂與正見相應出世心隔絕故。	此意識為餘識別攀緣所間者，謂與正見相應出世心隔絕故。	This mental consciousness is interrupted by the discrimination of other consciousnesses means that the supramundane mind that accords with correct views is cut off.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a20_9']	若正思惟相應心生者，謂於後時正思惟。	若正思惟相應心生者，謂於後時正思惟。	If a mind that accords with correct contemplation arises means correct contemplation at a later time.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a22_18']	彼久滅過去者，謂前意識已謝滅經無量時，聞所熏及熏習皆不得有，云何得以此為因生後正思惟相應意識？	彼久滅過去者，謂前意識已謝滅經無量時，聞所熏及熏習皆不得有，云何得以此為因生後正思惟相應意識？	That has long since ceased and is in the past means that the previous mental consciousness has long since ceased and passed away, and immeasurable time has elapsed. The perfuming of hearing and the perfuming cannot exist. How can it be that this becomes the cause for the subsequent mental consciousness that accords with correct contemplation to arise?
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a23_10']	彼中者，謂世間意識中。	彼中者，謂世間意識中。	In it means in the worldly mental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a24_6']	聞熏習者，由聞他音聲熏習意識中。	聞熏習者，由聞他音聲熏習意識中。	The perfuming of hearing means the perfuming of the mental consciousness by the sounds of others.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a26_3']	若作是念，彼攝持種子不成故，謂攝持出世淨種子不成故，若有種子生義可成。	若作是念，彼攝持種子不成故，謂攝持出世淨種子不成故，若有種子生義可成。	If you think that the seeds are not included in it, then the seeds of supramundane pure dharmas are not included, and if there are seeds, the meaning of arising can be established.

['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281a28_12']	復次此一切種子果報識既為染法因，云何復成彼對治出世心種子？	復次此一切種子果報識既為染法因，云何復成彼對治出世心種子？	Next, since this consciousness that is the result of all seeds is the cause of defiled dharmas, how can it also be the seed of the supramundane mind that opposes them?
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b01_1']	又此出世心昔未曾有故無熏習，既無熏習從何種子而生？	又此出世心昔未曾有故無熏習，既無熏習從何種子而生？	Moreover, since this supramundane mind has never existed before, there is no perfuming. Since there is no perfuming, from what seed does it arise?
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b01_6']	汝今應答：	汝今應答：	You should now answer:
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b02_5']	善清淨法界所流津液聞熏習為種子得生。	善清淨法界所流津液聞熏習為種子得生。	The seed that gives rise to it is the perfuming of hearing that flows from the extremely pure Dharma realm.

['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b03_10', 'ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b04_9']	此果報識既為障礙因體，即不成彼對治因體。🔽又此出世心初未曾有者，謂昔來未生故。	此果報識既為障礙因體，即不成彼對治因體。 又此出世心初未曾有者，謂昔來未生故。	Since this consciousness as retribution is the substance of the cause of obstacles, it cannot be the substance of the cause that opposes them.🔽Moreover, the phrase this supramundane mind has never existed before means that it has never arisen before.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b05_11']	無熏習者，由昔來未生，彼出世心熏習決定未有故。	無熏習者，由昔來未生，彼出世心熏習決定未有故。	The phrase there is no perfuming means that since it has never arisen before, the perfuming of that supramundane mind definitely does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b07_14']	善清淨法界所流津液聞熏習為種子得生者，為別異聲聞故言善清淨法界所流津液聞熏習。	善清淨法界所流津液聞熏習為種子得生者，為別異聲聞故言善清淨法界所流津液聞熏習。	Born from the pure Dharma realm, the moisture flowing from it, the seeds of hearing and cultivation - this is said to distinguish it from the hearing of the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T31_1596_003:0281b08_17']	由善清淨法界滅智障煩惱障故，名善清淨法界。	由善清淨法界滅智障煩惱障故，名善清淨法界。	Because the pure Dharma realm eliminates the obstacle of afflictions and the obstacle to wisdom, it is called the pure Dharma realm.
