In the third year of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty, in the eleventh month, there was a fight between a group of white-necked crows and black crows in Ju County, Chu State. The white-necked ones were defeated and fell into the waters of the Si River, with several thousand dying. Liu Xiang took it as a recent auspicious sign. The King of Chu rebelled against the unrighteous punishment and humiliation of Shen Gong. He conspired with Wu to rebel. The group of crows fighting is a symbol of the battle of the armies. The white-necked ones are the small ones. The clear small ones are defeated. Those who fell into the water are about to die in the water and on land. The king's attack did not awaken him. He then raised troops to respond to Wu and had a great battle with the Han. The troops were defeated and fled. They reached Dantu and were beheaded by the people of Yue. This is the effect of falling into the Si River. The Transmission of Changes by Jing Fang says: The rebel relatives are black on the day of the demon.
