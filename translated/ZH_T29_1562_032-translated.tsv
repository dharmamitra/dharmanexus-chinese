Analyzing and analyzing to the ultimate, there is still a remainder that can be seen by the eye and cannot be further analyzed. In this way, the aggregate of form cannot be analyzed to the point of nonexistence, just as the coarse aggregate has a principle of divisibility.

Just as when aggregates are analyzed to the ultimate, wisdom analyzing to the ultimate should have a remainder, which can be seen by wisdom and cannot be further analyzed. This remainder is precisely the ultimate atom.
