['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b11_0']	異熟無記法，　　有情有記生，	異熟無記法，　　有情有記生，	010	Retribution is a neutral dharma. Sentient beings are born from karmic consciousness.

['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b15_15']	唯於無覆無記法中有異熟果。	唯於無覆無記法中有異熟果。	010	Only in the unobscured neutral dharmas is there the effect of retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b16_9']	若爾，則應非有情數亦是異熟。	若爾，則應非有情數亦是異熟。	010	If that is so, then what is not included in sentient beings should also be retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b17_8']	為欲簡彼說有情言，唯於有情有異熟故。	為欲簡彼說有情言，唯於有情有異熟故。	010	In order to distinguish that, it is said that sentient beings exist. Because only in sentient beings is there retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b18_7']	若爾，於彼有情數中，長養等流應是異熟。	若爾，於彼有情數中，長養等流應是異熟。	010	If that is so, then among those included in sentient beings, the nourished and outflowing effects should be retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b19_15']	又為簡彼說有記生，一切不善及善有漏能記異熟，故名有記。	又為簡彼說有記生，一切不善及善有漏能記異熟，故名有記。	010	Also, in order to distinguish it from the other two, it is said that the retribution of good and bad actions is born of the existent, because all bad and good impure dharmas can indicate retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b20_15']	從彼後時異熟方起，非俱無間，名有記生。	從彼後時異熟方起，非俱無間，名有記生。	010	Retribution arises later, not simultaneously or immediately after, and therefore it is said that it is born of the existent.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b21_4']	如是名為異熟果相。	如是名為異熟果相。	010	This is the characteristic of retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b24_1']	豈不異熟亦以前位異熟果體為同類因，是前異熟等流果故，則應亦說從無記生是等流性，如何乃說從有記生非等流性？	豈不異熟亦以前位異熟果體為同類因，是前異熟等流果故，則應亦說從無記生是等流性，如何乃說從有記生非等流性？	010	Isn’t it true that retribution is also a similar cause for the substance of retribution in a prior state? Because it is a homogeneous cause, it is the cause of retribution. Then you should also say that it is born of the non-existent, because it is a homogeneous result. How is it that you say that it is born of the existent and is not a homogeneous result?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b25_17']	無如是失，異熟果體由同類因相有雜亂，由異熟因相無雜亂，是故但說從有記生。	無如是失，異熟果體由同類因相有雜亂，由異熟因相無雜亂，是故但說從有記生。	010	There is no such error. The substance of retribution is confused in its characteristics as a homogeneous cause, but the characteristics of the cause of retribution are not confused. Therefore it is said that it is born of the existent.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b27_2']	由此准知非等流性，以等流果與因相似有雜亂故。	由此准知非等流性，以等流果與因相似有雜亂故。	010	On the basis of this, we know that it is not a homogeneous result, because a homogeneous result is confused with its cause in characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b28_5']	若異熟果與因相別無雜亂故，何故非情非異熟果？	若異熟果與因相別無雜亂故，何故非情非異熟果？	010	If a result of retribution is not confused with its cause in characteristics, why is it not a result of retribution for insentient things?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b28_14']	共業所得共受用故。	共業所得共受用故。	010	Because they are equally enjoyed by all sentient beings who have equally created them.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819b29_15']	大梵住處諸大梵共感，餘可於中有受用理故。	大梵住處諸大梵共感，餘可於中有受用理故。	010	The place of the great Brahma is created by the common karma of the great Brahmas. It is reasonable that other sentient beings can enjoy it.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c01_9']	多有情業如何共感一非情果？	多有情業如何共感一非情果？	010	How can the karma of many sentient beings create a single non-sentient result?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c02_4']	自類因一，業緣有多，亦無有過。	自類因一，業緣有多，亦無有過。	010	There is no error in this, because the homogeneous cause is one, while the karmic conditions are many.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c03_3']	又見少業能生多果，如何少果非多業生？	又見少業能生多果，如何少果非多業生？	010	Moreover, we see that a small amount of karma can produce many results. Why can't many results arise from many karmas?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c03_17']	能作因業，果少果多俱無所妨。	能作因業，果少果多俱無所妨。	010	There is no contradiction in the results of productive causes being few or many.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c04_11']	異熟因力即不如是，果非共故。	異熟因力即不如是，果非共故。	010	The power of the retributive cause is not like this, because the result is not shared.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c05_11']	共果數招，非順熟義，是故異熟不攝非情。	共果數招，非順熟義，是故異熟不攝非情。	010	Shared results are repeatedly created, but this is not the meaning of conforming to maturation. Therefore the results of retribution do not include non-sentient beings.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c06_11']	似自因法名等流果，謂似同類、遍行二因。	似自因法名等流果，謂似同類、遍行二因。	010	Results that resemble their causes are called results similar to their causes, which means that they resemble the two causes of the same category and omnipresent causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c07_10']	如同類因，善染無記等流果性，其相亦爾。	如同類因，善染無記等流果性，其相亦爾。	010	Like the cause of the same category, the nature of the results similar to their causes is also good, defiled, non-defined, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c08_10']	如遍行因，唯是染污等流果性，其相亦爾。	如遍行因，唯是染污等流果性，其相亦爾。	010	Like the omnipresent cause, the nature of the results similar to their causes is also only defiled.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c09_4']	豈不俱起士用果性亦似自因？	豈不俱起士用果性亦似自因？	010	Don’t the dominant results of simultaneous dharmas also resemble their causes?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c09_17']	如何可言似自因法名等流果？	如何可言似自因法名等流果？	010	How can you say that dharmas that resemble their causes are called results similar to their causes?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c11_16']	無等流果不似自因，有士用果與自因異，故似自因名等流果，定無濫彼士用果失。	無等流果不似自因，有士用果與自因異，故似自因名等流果，定無濫彼士用果失。	010	There are no results similar to their causes that do not resemble their causes, but there are dominant results that differ from their causes. Therefore, dharmas that resemble their causes are called results similar to their causes, and there is no error in the above definition.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c13_5']	豈不亦有等流異因，如遍行因望異部果，染性同故名似自因。	豈不亦有等流異因，如遍行因望異部果，染性同故名似自因。	010	Aren’t there results similar to their causes that differ from their causes, such as the homogeneous cause, which produces a result that belongs to a different class? The similarity of defilement is called resemblance to its cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c13_14']	士用果性有與因別。	士用果性有與因別。	010	The nature of dominant results differs from its cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c14_10']	又以因者，謂果與因具二相似。	又以因者，謂果與因具二相似。	010	Moreover, a cause is that which possesses two similarities with its result.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c15_6', 'ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c16_13']	一體二性，體謂受等，性謂善等。🔽若於俱起士用果中，其性雖同而體必異，無二受等俱時生故。	一體二性，體謂受等，性謂善等。 若於俱起士用果中，其性雖同而體必異，無二受等俱時生故。	010	The first is substance, that is, such things as feeling, and the second is nature, that is, such things as being good.🔽If the dominant result of a simultaneous dharma, its nature is the same as its cause, but its substance must differ, because two feelings, etc., do not occur simultaneously.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c18_2']	若於後起士用果中，性之與體皆容有異，故不可說果定似因。	若於後起士用果中，性之與體皆容有異，故不可說果定似因。	010	If the dominant result of a subsequent dharma, its nature and substance may differ, and therefore you cannot say that the result resembles its cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c19_10']	其等流果性必似因，於其體中亦容有似，故唯此果說似自因。	其等流果性必似因，於其體中亦容有似，故唯此果說似自因。	010	The nature of the effect similar to its cause must resemble the cause. It may also exist in the substance of the effect. Therefore, only this effect is said to resemble its cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c20_17']	然此二因互有寬狹故別建立，果望自因俱必相似故合立一。	然此二因互有寬狹故別建立，果望自因俱必相似故合立一。	010	However, these two causes are established separately because they are either broader or narrower. The effect is similar to its cause. Therefore, they are combined to form one.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c22_7']	由慧盡法名離繫果，滅故名盡，擇故名慧，即說擇滅名離繫果。	由慧盡法名離繫果，滅故名盡，擇故名慧，即說擇滅名離繫果。	010	The effect of disjunction is called the effect of disjunction because it is the extinction of wisdom. Extinction is called disjunction because it is the extinction of wisdom. Therefore, cessation through discrimination is called the effect of disjunction.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c23_7']	由擇為因，離諸繫縛，證得此滅故名為果。	由擇為因，離諸繫縛，證得此滅故名為果。	010	Because of the cause of discrimination, one is free from all bonds and realizes this cessation. Therefore, it is called the effect.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c24_6']	若法因彼勢力所生，即說此法名士用果。	若法因彼勢力所生，即說此法名士用果。	010	If a dharma is produced by the power of another, it is called the effect of the dominant condition.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c24_16']	此有四種，如前已說。	此有四種，如前已說。	010	There are four kinds of this, as has been explained above.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c25_15']	言俱生者，謂同一時更互為因力所生法。	言俱生者，謂同一時更互為因力所生法。	010	As for the simultaneously born, it means that dharmas produced by the power of being causes for each other at the same time.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c26_17']	言無間者，謂次後生，如世第一法生苦法智忍。	言無間者，謂次後生，如世第一法生苦法智忍。	010	As for the immediately antecedent, it means that which is born next, such as the receptivity to the knowledge of the factors with regard to suffering born from the supreme worldly dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c27_16']	言隔越者，謂隔時生，如農夫等於穀麥等。	言隔越者，謂隔時生，如農夫等於穀麥等。	010	As for the separated, it means that which is born separated by time, such as the farmers and so on with regard to the grains and wheat and so on.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c28_16']	言不生者，所謂涅槃，無間道力彼得生故。	言不生者，所謂涅槃，無間道力彼得生故。	010	As for the phrase “that which is not born,” this refers to nirvāṇa, because the power of the path of noninterruption causes it to be born.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c29_7']	此既不生，如何可說？	此既不生，如何可說？	010	Since it is not born, how can it be said to be the effect of the dominant result?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0819c29_16']	彼力生故名士用果。	彼力生故名士用果。	010	It is called the effect of the dominant result because it is born by the power of the path of noninterruption.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a01_16']	現見於得亦說生名，如說我財生是我得財義。	現見於得亦說生名，如說我財生是我得財義。	010	We see that birth is also spoken of with regard to obtaining, as in the statement, “My wealth is born,” which means “I have obtained wealth.”
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a03_1']	若無間道斷諸隨眠所證擇滅，名離繫果及士用果。	若無間道斷諸隨眠所證擇滅，名離繫果及士用果。	010	The cessation resulting from discrimination that is realized by the path of noninterruption that eliminates the propensities is called the effect of separation and the effect of the dominant result.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a04_4']	若無間道不斷隨眠，所證擇滅，唯士用果非離繫果。	若無間道不斷隨眠，所證擇滅，唯士用果非離繫果。	010	If the cessation resulting from discrimination that is realized by the path of noninterruption is not the elimination of the propensities, it is only the effect of the dominant result, not the effect of separation.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a04_15']	歷諸位說如《順正理》。	歷諸位說如《順正理》。	010	The various states are discussed in the Abhidharmasamuccaya.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a06_2']	諸有為法除在前生是餘有為之增上果，必無少果在因前生。	諸有為法除在前生是餘有為之增上果，必無少果在因前生。	010	All conditioned dharmas, with the exception of those born previously, are the dominant results of other conditioned dharmas. There is no result that is born prior to its cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a07_1']	果若前生，後因無用，應未來法畢竟不生。	果若前生，後因無用，應未來法畢竟不生。	010	If the result were born prior to the cause, then the subsequent cause would be useless, and future dharmas would never be born.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a07_11']	士用、增上二果何別？	士用、增上二果何別？	010	What is the difference between the two results, the effect of the dominant result and the effect of the human action?
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a08_10']	士用果名唯對作者，增上果名兼對受者。	士用果名唯對作者，增上果名兼對受者。	010	The name effect of the dominant result is given only to that which is created by the doer, while the name effect of the dominant result is given to that which is created by the doer and also to that which is created by others.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a09_8']	於上所說六種因中，何位何因取果與果？	於上所說六種因中，何位何因取果與果？	010	Among the six causes explained above, in what state do they take effects and give effects?

['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a10_0']	五取果唯現，　　二與果亦然，	五取果唯現，　　二與果亦然，	010	The five take effects only in the present, and two give effects in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a11_13']	過現與二因，　　一與唯過去。	過現與二因，　　一與唯過去。	010	Past and present give two causes, and one gives only in the past.

['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a13_1']	五因取果唯於現在，定非過去，彼已取故；	五因取果唯於現在，定非過去，彼已取故；	010	The five causes take effects only in the present. They definitely are not in the past, because they have already taken them.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a13_11']	亦非未來，無作用故。	亦非未來，無作用故。	010	They are also not in the future, because they have no function.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a14_10']	言取果者，是能引義，謂引未來令其生等。	言取果者，是能引義，謂引未來令其生等。	010	As for taking effects, it means being able to attract, that is, attracting the future and causing it to arise, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a17_13']	於同體類能為種子，於異體類由同一果於非一果，由同性類於異性類，而由有是自聚相續，是故一切皆名能引，如是能引名為取果。	於同體類能為種子，於異體類由同一果於非一果，由同性類於異性類，而由有是自聚相續，是故一切皆名能引，如是能引名為取果。	010	It can be a seed for the same kind, and for different kinds it is by the same effect. For that which is not a single effect, it is by the same nature. For different natures, it is because there is this continuity of one's own group. Therefore, all are called able to attract. This able to attract is called taking effects.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a18_18']	此取果用唯現在有，非於去來，唯此可名有為作用。	此取果用唯現在有，非於去來，唯此可名有為作用。	010	This function of taking effects only exists in the present, not in the past or future. Only this can be called the function of conditioned phenomena.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a20_7']	相應、俱有、異熟三因，皆說功能名為作用，果異因故、二俱時故。	相應、俱有、異熟三因，皆說功能名為作用，果異因故、二俱時故。	010	The three causes of corresponding, coexistent, and retribution are said to be called function by their power, because the effect is different from the cause and the two are simultaneous.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a20_17']	所言五者，簡能作因。	所言五者，簡能作因。	010	The term five excludes the efficient cause.

['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a22_11']	應如同類、遍行二因，但非一切。	應如同類、遍行二因，但非一切。	010	It should be like the two causes of homogeneous and omnipresent, but not all.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a23_6']	有增上果，可取或與，故此不說。	有增上果，可取或與，故此不說。	010	There is an dominant effect that can be taken or given, so this is not discussed.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a23_15']	如何此因唯現取果？	如何此因唯現取果？	010	How does this cause only take an effect in the present?

['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a27_16']	無如是事，入二定心唯現在時能取二定及出心果。	無如是事，入二定心唯現在時能取二定及出心果。	010	There is no such thing, the mind that enters the two attainments only in the present can take the effect of the two attainments and the mind that exits.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820a29_10']	然由二定是正所求必應先起，由此為障，令出定心非於入心無間即起。	然由二定是正所求必應先起，由此為障，令出定心非於入心無間即起。	010	However, since the two samādhis are the correct objects of pursuit, one must first generate them. Because they are obstacles, the mind emerging from samādhi does not arise immediately after the mind entering samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_010:0820b01_12']	據與果義說過去生二心，此義於後當更分別。	據與果義說過去生二心，此義於後當更分別。	010	In terms of the meaning of giving results, it is said that two minds arise in the past. This meaning will be further distinguished later.
