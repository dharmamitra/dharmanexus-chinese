Therefore, using responding to explain response.

['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747a19_2']	若微以釋機，赴以釋應者，是赴樂欲之心也。	若微以釋機，赴以釋應者，是赴樂欲之心也。	If subtle is used to explain the conditions and responding is used to explain the responses, this is responding to the mind of joy and desire.
['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747a21_13']	何但心善可生名之為欲，如草木無心，亦稱可生、欲生、將生，故知赴此善生，是隨樂欲，即世界悉檀明機應也。	何但心善可生名之為欲，如草木無心，亦稱可生、欲生、將生，故知赴此善生，是隨樂欲，即世界悉檀明機應也。	Not only is the arising of a good mind called desire, even grasses and trees without minds are said to be able to grow, about to grow, and about to sprout. Therefore, we know that responding to this growth of goodness is following joy and desire, which is the world siddhānta in clarifying conditions and responses.
['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747a22_11']	若關以釋機，對以釋應，更相對當。	若關以釋機，對以釋應，更相對當。	If connection is used to explain the conditions and facing is used to explain the responses, they are matched with each other.

['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747a25_4']	次以宜釋機，以應釋應者，即是為人、第一義也。	次以宜釋機，以應釋應者，即是為人、第一義也。	Next, using suitability to explain the conditions and using response to explain the responses is the same as the siddhānta of benefiting others and the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747a26_10']	宜以如此等法，與其機感相宜，宜生事善，即為人悉檀；	宜以如此等法，與其機感相宜，宜生事善，即為人悉檀；	Suitability means that these dharmas are suitable with the conditions and responses, suitable for giving rise to good deeds, which is the siddhānta of benefiting others;
['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747a27_5']	宜生理善，即是第一義悉檀也。	宜生理善，即是第一義悉檀也。	The principle of good is precisely the first principle of the four siddhāntas.

It never happens that the principle of evil is extinguished and then the principle of good arises. Therefore, the principle of good is called the first principle of the four siddhāntas.
['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747b01_13']	若事善生，事惡未必去；	若事善生，事惡未必去；	If good events arise, it does not necessarily mean that evil events will disappear;

['ZH_T33_1716_06a:0747b03_15']	事是隔別，對治悉檀正是藥病相對，故不於中開第一義悉檀，其意在此。	事是隔別，對治悉檀正是藥病相對，故不於中開第一義悉檀，其意在此。	Events are separate and distinct. The principle of counteracting is precisely the correspondence between medicine and illness. Therefore, the first principle of the four siddhāntas is not explained in the middle. The meaning is here.
