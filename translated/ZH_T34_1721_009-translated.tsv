['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b08_7']	今是第二，次、為授記，以聞法悟解、行與佛應，故授佛記。	今是第二，次、為授記，以聞法悟解、行與佛應，故授佛記。	009	Now, the second part is the prediction. Since they have heard the Dharma, realized understanding, and their practice accords with the Buddha, they are given the prediction of Buddhahood.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b09_16']	次、授學無學人記為一品。	次、授學無學人記為一品。	009	Next, the prediction for those with and without more to learn is one chapter.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b11_14']	所以開二品者，上〈授記品〉標其總名，今欲異上故以人別品，故總別兩題立名相避也。	所以開二品者，上〈授記品〉標其總名，今欲異上故以人別品，故總別兩題立名相避也。	009	The reason for dividing it into two chapters is that the previous chapter on predictions has a general title. Now, in order to distinguish it from the previous, it uses people to differentiate the chapters. Therefore, the general and specific titles are established to avoid repetition.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b12_11']	所以約人分二品者，凡有十義五雙：	所以約人分二品者，凡有十義五雙：	009	The reason for dividing it into two chapters based on people is that there are ten meanings in five pairs:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b13_17']	一者、五百弟子願行是同，現在同時得記，未來相繼成佛；	一者、五百弟子願行是同，現在同時得記，未來相繼成佛；	009	First, the five hundred disciples have the same vows and practices, and in the present they receive predictions at the same time, and in the future they will become Buddhas one after another;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b15_11']	後學無學人願行亦同，現在同時得記，未來一時成佛，為此因緣故開二品。	後學無學人願行亦同，現在同時得記，未來一時成佛，為此因緣故開二品。	009	The aspirations and practices of the later learners and those beyond learning are also the same. They will attain predictions simultaneously in the present and become Buddhas at the same time in the future. For this reason, two chapters are opened.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b17_5']	一者、前後相繼成佛；	一者、前後相繼成佛；	009	First, becoming Buddhas in succession before and after;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b17_14']	二者、一時成佛也。	二者、一時成佛也。	009	Second, becoming Buddhas at the same time.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b19_11']	三者、前五百人謂高名顯德眾，後二千人藏名密行眾，以部類顯密不同故開為兩品。	三者、前五百人謂高名顯德眾，後二千人藏名密行眾，以部類顯密不同故開為兩品。	009	Third, the first five hundred people are the assembly of those with lofty names and evident virtues, while the last two thousand people are the assembly of those with hidden names and secret practices. The categories are different in terms of being evident or secret, so they are opened into two chapters.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b20_8']	四者、即欲以顯密二人攝授記義盡。	四者、即欲以顯密二人攝授記義盡。	009	Fourth, it is precisely in order to include the meaning of predictions with the two people of the evident and secret.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b22_3']	五者、前五百人同是無學位，後二千人是學無學位，以部類不同故分二品。	五者、前五百人同是無學位，後二千人是學無學位，以部類不同故分二品。	009	Fifth, the first five hundred people are all of the stage beyond learning, while the last two thousand people are of the stages of learning and beyond learning. The categories are different, so they are divided into two chapters.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b27_1']	九者、前五百人亦有發迹亦無發迹，如滿願則發迹，餘人不發迹，故為一類；	九者、前五百人亦有發迹亦無發迹，如滿願則發迹，餘人不發迹，故為一類；	009	Ninth, the first five hundred people also have revealed traces and also have no revealed traces. For example, Subhūti reveals his traces, while the others do not reveal their traces, so they form one category;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578b29_2']	後學無學人亦有發迹亦無發迹，如阿難、羅雲則發迹，餘無發迹，復為一類，所以分為兩品。	後學無學人亦有發迹亦無發迹，如阿難、羅雲則發迹，餘無發迹，復為一類，所以分為兩品。	009	The later learners and post-learners also have revealed traces and also have no revealed traces. For example, Ānanda and Rāhula reveal their traces, while the others do not reveal their traces, so they again form one category, which is why they are divided into two chapters.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c01_1']	十者、即以有發迹無發迹攝授記義周也。	十者、即以有發迹無發迹攝授記義周也。	009	Tenth, it is precisely in order to include the meaning of prediction with those who have revealed traces and those who have not revealed traces.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c01_3']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c01_20']	此品實授千二百人記，何故題五百也？	此品實授千二百人記，何故題五百也？	009	In this chapter, the predictions for the twelve hundred people are actually given, so why is it titled Five Hundred?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c02_1']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c02_19']	五百即千二百數，所以別題者凡有四義：	五百即千二百數，所以別題者凡有四義：	009	The five hundred are the number of the twelve hundred, so there are four reasons for the separate title:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c04_7']	一者、佛在世時有高名顯威德五百羅漢常隨侍佛，故偏題之。	一者、佛在世時有高名顯威德五百羅漢常隨侍佛，故偏題之。	009	First, when the Buddha was in the world, there were five hundred arhats with high fame and prominent majestic virtue who always attended the Buddha, so they are mentioned specifically.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c05_12']	二者、此五百人願行是同，現在俱時得記、未來相繼成佛。	二者、此五百人願行是同，現在俱時得記、未來相繼成佛。	009	Second, the vows and practices of these five hundred people are the same. In the present, they all attained the prediction at the same time, and in the future, they will successively become Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c06_16']	三者、此五百人同有自能領解說繫珠之功，故偏舉之。	三者、此五百人同有自能領解說繫珠之功，故偏舉之。	009	Third, these five hundred people all have the ability to understand and explain the matter of tying the pearl, so they are mentioned specifically.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c08_12']	四者、佛初成道，前度五人、次度迦葉師徒，即成五百，今從初立名，故偏舉也。	四者、佛初成道，前度五人、次度迦葉師徒，即成五百，今從初立名，故偏舉也。	009	Fourth, when the Buddha first attained enlightenment, he first saved the five people, and then saved Kāśyapa and his disciples, making a total of five hundred. Now, following the original names, they are mentioned specifically.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c08_17']	品開為二：	品開為二：	009	The chapter is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c09_4']	一者、別授滿願記；	一者、別授滿願記；	009	First, the specific prediction for Pūrṇa;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c09_14']	二者、總授餘聲聞記。	二者、總授餘聲聞記。	009	Second, the general prediction for the remaining voice-hearers.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c12_1']	別授滿願記者，滿願有發迹、餘人無發迹，滿願無自能領解、餘人有自能領解，以部類不同故開二段也。	別授滿願記者，滿願有發迹、餘人無發迹，滿願無自能領解、餘人有自能領解，以部類不同故開二段也。	009	As for the specific prediction for Pūrṇa, Pūrṇa has revealed his traces, while the others have not. Pūrṇa has no ability to understand by himself, while the others have. This is because the categories are different, so they are divided into two sections.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c12_3']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c13_2']	發迹何故無自敘領解，不發迹有自能領解？	發迹何故無自敘領解，不發迹有自能領解？	009	Why is it that in the chapter on revealing the traces there is no self-narration of understanding, and in the chapter on not revealing the traces there is self-understanding?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c13_4']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c15_2']	夫論領解，必是昔迷今悟，既其發迹則昔不實迷、今非真悟，故發迹之人不自能領解；	夫論領解，必是昔迷今悟，既其發迹則昔不實迷、今非真悟，故發迹之人不自能領解；	009	In discussing understanding, it must be that one was deluded in the past but enlightened now. Since one reveals the traces, the past delusion was not real, and the present enlightenment is not true. Therefore, those who reveal the traces cannot understand by themselves;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c15_19']	不發迹人既實昔迷今悟，故有自領解。	不發迹人既實昔迷今悟，故有自領解。	009	Those who do not reveal the traces are truly deluded in the past and enlightened now, so there is self-understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c16_1']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c17_2']	上中二人皆無發迹，何故至下根人有發迹耶？	上中二人皆無發迹，何故至下根人有發迹耶？	009	Why is it that in the upper and middle chapters both do not reveal the traces, but in the lower chapter there is revealing of the traces?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c17_4']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c17_9', 'ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c19_8']	可具五義：🔽一者、文互有隱顯，若並發迹則無實悟之人，若不並發迹則隱菩薩德，是以經文出沒不同。	可具五義： 一者、文互有隱顯，若並發迹則無實悟之人，若不並發迹則隱菩薩德，是以經文出沒不同。	009	It can be explained in five ways:🔽First, the text has hidden and revealed aspects. If the traces are all revealed, then there are no truly enlightened people. If the traces are not all revealed, then the virtues of the bodhisattvas are hidden. Therefore, the revealed and unrevealed aspects of the text are different.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c21_13']	二者、下根發迹則顯菩薩不可思議，現為聲聞已是隱德，於聲聞中復為下根，是故名為不可思議。	二者、下根發迹則顯菩薩不可思議，現為聲聞已是隱德，於聲聞中復為下根，是故名為不可思議。	009	Second, if the traces are revealed in the lower chapter, then the virtues of the bodhisattvas are shown to be inconceivable. Even manifesting as śrāvakas is already hiding their virtues, and among the śrāvakas they are again of the lower capacity. Therefore, they are called inconceivable.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c23_15']	三者、示作聲聞本為化物，今三根皆悟則化物事畢方得發迹，上章化事未周故不明發迹也。	三者、示作聲聞本為化物，今三根皆悟則化物事畢方得發迹，上章化事未周故不明發迹也。	009	Third, it shows that the śrāvakas originally manifested for the sake of transforming beings. Now that the three capacities have all awakened, the matter of transforming beings is complete, and only then can they reveal their original grounds. In the previous chapter, the matter of transformation was not yet complete, so the revelation of their original grounds was not yet clear.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c24_14']	四者、下根人尚發迹，中上根豈是實行耶？	四者、下根人尚發迹，中上根豈是實行耶？	009	Fourth, if even those of the lowest capacity reveal their original grounds, how could those of the middle and highest capacities be truly practicing?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c25_13']	故《攝大乘論》云「舍利弗等皆是化人」。	故《攝大乘論》云「舍利弗等皆是化人」。	009	Therefore, the Mahāyānasaṃgraha-śāstra says, Śāriputra and the others are all transformed people.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c27_1']	故有經云「須菩提者是東方世界青龍陀佛」，則知皆是權行人也。	故有經云「須菩提者是東方世界青龍陀佛」，則知皆是權行人也。	009	Therefore, there is a sūtra that says, Subhūti is the Buddha Blue Dragon Tamer of the eastern world. It can be known that they are all people practicing skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c28_1']	五者、顯示菩薩有發迹、不發迹二種方便也。	五者、顯示菩薩有發迹、不發迹二種方便也。	009	Fifth, it reveals that bodhisattvas have two kinds of skillful means: revealing their original grounds and not revealing their original grounds.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c28_3']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c28_10']	發迹有何利益？	發迹有何利益？	009	What are the benefits of revealing one's original grounds?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c28_12']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c28_21']	開一為三凡有二種：	開一為三凡有二種：	009	There are two kinds of revealing the One as the Three:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c29_9']	一者、開一法為三法；	一者、開一法為三法；	009	First, revealing one dharma as three dharmas;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0578c29_19']	二者、開一人為三人。	二者、開一人為三人。	009	Second, revealing one person as three people.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a02_9']	上來雖明一法為三法、三法歸一法，未辨一人為三人、三人為一人。	上來雖明一法為三法、三法歸一法，未辨一人為三人、三人為一人。	009	Although it has been explained above that one dharma is the three dharmas and the three dharmas return to the one dharma, it has not yet been distinguished that one person is the three people and the three people are one person.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a04_7']	今發諸菩薩迹始得明一人為三人、三人為一人，以具約人法明於開會，義始圓也。	今發諸菩薩迹始得明一人為三人、三人為一人，以具約人法明於開會，義始圓也。	009	Now, the traces of the bodhisattvas being inspired begin to clarify that one person is the three people and the three people are one person. By fully discussing people and dharmas to clarify the opening and merging, the meaning finally becomes complete.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a04_14']	授滿願記為二：	授滿願記為二：	009	The bestowal of the prophecy to Pūrṇa is in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a05_4']	第一、聞法為領解之緣；	第一、聞法為領解之緣；	009	The first is hearing the Dharma as the condition for understanding;

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a07_13']	「智慧」者，實慧也。	「智慧」者，實慧也。	009	Wisdom refers to true wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a07_23']	「方便」者，權慧也。	「方便」者，權慧也。	009	Skillful means refers to expedient wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a08_11']	總牒法譬二周中權實二慧法也。	總牒法譬二周中權實二慧法也。	009	It generally refers to the two wisdoms of expedient and true in the two chapters on Dharma and parables.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a09_18']	「又聞授諸大弟子記」者，總牒二周中授人記為領解緣也。	「又聞授諸大弟子記」者，總牒二周中授人記為領解緣也。	009	Also hearing the bestowal of predictions to the great disciples means generally referring to the two periods of bestowing predictions on people as the conditions for understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a11_3']	「復聞宿世因緣之事」者，牒第三周化城事為領解緣也。	「復聞宿世因緣之事」者，牒第三周化城事為領解緣也。	009	And hearing about the events of past causes and conditions refers to the events of the city of the Dharma teaching in the third period as the conditions for understanding.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a12_16']	「復聞諸佛有大自在神通之力」者，即大通智勝佛十劫坐道場及現瑞等事也。	「復聞諸佛有大自在神通之力」者，即大通智勝佛十劫坐道場及現瑞等事也。	009	And hearing that the buddhas have the power of great mastery and spiritual powers refers to the events such as Mahābhijñājñānābhibuddharāja sitting at the site of enlightenment for ten kalpas and manifesting auspicious signs, etc.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a14_2']	又解即是釋迦能知過去久遠之事為自在神通之力。	又解即是釋迦能知過去久遠之事為自在神通之力。	009	Another explanation is that it is precisely Śākyamuni's ability to know past events from long ago that is the power of mastery and spiritual powers.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a16_1']	所以但明四事者，初事謂教，次事是得益之人，宿世因緣敘教益所由，後明能化之主；	所以但明四事者，初事謂教，次事是得益之人，宿世因緣敘教益所由，後明能化之主；	009	The reason for only explaining four things is that the first thing refers to the teaching, the next thing is the people who have benefited, the past causes and conditions narrate the reasons for the teaching and benefits, and the last clarifies the master of the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0579a16_12']	攝義既周，宜辨四事也。	攝義既周，宜辨四事也。	009	Since the meaning is already complete, it is appropriate to explain the four things.

Therefore, this sutra is spoken by the Buddha in three periods, and the disciples also speak in three periods.

However, the correct observation of quiescence has never been teacher or disciple. For the sake of sentient beings, they expediently become teacher and disciple, wishing to enable those who receive the teaching to awaken to equality.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0580c07_9']	故《涅槃經》云「說法非師亦非弟子是名中道」，師弟子既是方便，迷悟亦然。	故《涅槃經》云「說法非師亦非弟子是名中道」，師弟子既是方便，迷悟亦然。	009	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, Explaining the Dharma is neither the teacher nor the disciples, this is called the middle way. Since the teacher and disciples are expedient means, delusion and enlightenment are also like this.

Neither destroying nor not destroying is called the middle way. One should always keep this meaning in mind when reading the Lotus Sutra.

One who achieves something is ignorance, not the great wisdom of equality. One who achieves something has no path and no fruit, and cannot practice the cause of the Buddha to attain the fruit of the Buddha.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585a05_5']	今明法師功德出能化之人相貌，有此相貌故是法師。	今明法師功德出能化之人相貌，有此相貌故是法師。	009	Now clarifying the appearance of the person who can transform, because there is this appearance, one is a Dharma teacher.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585a06_4']	三者、上告藥王列二世弟子令師識弟子；	三者、上告藥王列二世弟子令師識弟子；	009	Third, above it announces that the Medicine King should list the disciples of the two worlds so that the teachers know their disciples;

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b08_5']	所以明信毀者凡有二義：	所以明信毀者凡有二義：	009	There are generally two reasons for clarifying faith and slander:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b10_5']	一者、如來出世欲示眾生罪福二門，故《大品》云「若不說魔事魔罪則是眾生惡知識」也。	一者、如來出世欲示眾生罪福二門，故《大品》云「若不說魔事魔罪則是眾生惡知識」也。	009	First, the Tathāgata appears in the world wishing to show sentient beings the two gates of sin and blessings, thus the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, If one does not speak of the affairs and sins of Māra, then one is a bad friend to sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b11_10']	二者、上明二種法師宣通正法之時，不應輕毀宜須供養。	二者、上明二種法師宣通正法之時，不應輕毀宜須供養。	009	Second, it is said that when the two kinds of Dharma teachers propagate the true Dharma, one should not slight or slander them but should make offerings to them.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b12_8']	毀持經人罪重佛者，汎論罪福凡有二種：	毀持經人罪重佛者，汎論罪福凡有二種：	009	The sin of reviling the person upholding the sūtra is heavier than that of the Buddha. Generally speaking, sin and merit are of two kinds:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b12_14']	一者、約心；	一者、約心；	009	First, in terms of the mind;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b12_20']	二者、約境。	二者、約境。	009	Second, in terms of the object.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b13_14']	約心者，重心則罪重、輕心即罪輕。	約心者，重心則罪重、輕心即罪輕。	009	In terms of the mind, if the mind is heavy, the sin is heavy; if the mind is light, the sin is light.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b14_12']	若爾重心毀佛則罪重，輕心毀佛則罪輕。	若爾重心毀佛則罪重，輕心毀佛則罪輕。	009	If so, reviling the Buddha with a heavy mind is a heavy sin, and reviling the Buddha with a light mind is a light sin.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b15_13']	持經人亦爾，不應言毀佛罪輕、毀持經人罪重。	持經人亦爾，不應言毀佛罪輕、毀持經人罪重。	009	The person upholding the sūtra is also like this. It should not be said that the sin of reviling the Buddha is light and the sin of reviling the person upholding the sūtra is heavy.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b17_10']	二者、約境，若罵勝境則罪重，毀劣境則罪輕，亦不應言罵佛罪輕、罵持經人罪重。	二者、約境，若罵勝境則罪重，毀劣境則罪輕，亦不應言罵佛罪輕、罵持經人罪重。	009	Second, in terms of the object, if one scolds a superior object, the sin is heavy; if one reviles an inferior object, the sin is light. It should also not be said that the sin of scolding the Buddha is light and the sin of scolding the person upholding the sūtra is heavy.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b18_4']	既不約心就境，云何釋此文耶？	既不約心就境，云何釋此文耶？	009	Since it does not refer to the mind or the object, how should this passage be explained?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b18_8']	有人言：	有人言：	009	Some people say:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b19_11']	罵佛不作斷法意故罪輕，毀弘經人作斷法意故罪重。	罵佛不作斷法意故罪輕，毀弘經人作斷法意故罪重。	009	Because scolding the Buddha does not have the intention of severing the Dharma, the sin is light. Because reviling the person propagating the sūtra has the intention of severing the Dharma, the sin is heavy.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b21_6']	所以然者，由此人弘法是故被罵，此則罵人復毀於法，罪兼二種所以重也。	所以然者，由此人弘法是故被罵，此則罵人復毀於法，罪兼二種所以重也。	009	The reason is that because this person promotes the Dharma, he is scolded. This is scolding the person and also slandering the Dharma. The offense is of two kinds, so it is heavy.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b21_11']	竺道生云：	竺道生云：	009	Zhu Daosheng said:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b22_15']	「法出於佛，若聞說罵佛，是則罵人非罵法，是故罪輕；	「法出於佛，若聞說罵佛，是則罵人非罵法，是故罪輕；	009	The Dharma comes from the Buddha. If one hears scolding the Buddha, it is scolding the person, not the Dharma. Therefore, the offense is light.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b23_17']	今受持有我，若毀呰之則是毀人有法乃毀法也」。	今受持有我，若毀呰之則是毀人有法乃毀法也」。	009	Now, in upholding the Dharma, there is self. If one disparages it, it is disparaging the person. Only when there is Dharma in the Dharma is it disparaging the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b24_18']	今明佛以離八風無復憂喜，雖復得毀不妨正化；	今明佛以離八風無復憂喜，雖復得毀不妨正化；	009	Now, it is explained that the Buddha is free from the eight winds and has no more worries or joys. Although he may be slandered, it does not hinder the correct teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b27_12']	今弘經之人猶是凡夫未免八風，若逢毀呰心則退悔不能弘法，法既不弘便無行法之人，既無行法之人誰復得佛？	今弘經之人猶是凡夫未免八風，若逢毀呰心則退悔不能弘法，法既不弘便無行法之人，既無行法之人誰復得佛？	009	Now, the person who promotes the sūtra is still an ordinary person who is not free from the eight winds. If he encounters slander, his mind will retreat and regret, and he will not be able to promote the Dharma. Since the Dharma is not promoted, there are no people who practice the Dharma. Since there are no people who practice the Dharma, who will attain Buddhahood?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b28_3']	以斷三寶種故罪重也。	以斷三寶種故罪重也。	009	Because it cuts off the lineage of the Three Jewels, the offense is heavy.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585b29_18']	又弘經人聞毀則妨自行，自不得成佛，亦妨化他，他又不成佛，則罪之大矣；	又弘經人聞毀則妨自行，自不得成佛，亦妨化他，他又不成佛，則罪之大矣；	009	Moreover, when the person who spreads the sutra hears slander, it will hinder their own practice, and they themselves will not attain Buddhahood, and it will also hinder the transformation of others, and others will also not attain Buddhahood, so the sin is great indeed;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c01_12']	佛聞俱不妨自行化他，故罪輕也。	佛聞俱不妨自行化他，故罪輕也。	009	But the Buddha hears both without hindrance to his own practice or transforming others, so the sin is light.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c02_9']	「藥王其有」下，第二、歎弘經人福重也。	「藥王其有」下，第二、歎弘經人福重也。	009	Righteous Man, if there are... is the second, praising the person who spreads the sutra for having heavy merit.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c04_6']	「以佛莊嚴而自莊嚴」者，佛以正觀之法莊嚴於人，通經之人亦入正觀故以法嚴人。	「以佛莊嚴而自莊嚴」者，佛以正觀之法莊嚴於人，通經之人亦入正觀故以法嚴人。	009	Adorning oneself with the adornments of the Buddha means that the Buddha uses the Dharma of right contemplation to adorn people, and the person who spreads the sutra also enters right contemplation, so he uses the Dharma to adorn people.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c06_1']	又佛住大乘用萬德而自莊嚴，弘經之人行與佛應，亦隨分具佛萬德也。	又佛住大乘用萬德而自莊嚴，弘經之人行與佛應，亦隨分具佛萬德也。	009	Moreover, the Buddha abides in the Mahayana and adorns himself with myriad virtues. The person who spreads the sutra practices in accord with the Buddha and also partially possesses the Buddha's myriad virtues.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c08_9']	「則為如來肩所荷擔」者，如來荷擔於法，持經之人既其弘法，佛以恭敬於法，既擔所弘之法亦擔能弘之人也。	「則為如來肩所荷擔」者，如來荷擔於法，持經之人既其弘法，佛以恭敬於法，既擔所弘之法亦擔能弘之人也。	009	Then he is carried on the Buddha's shoulders means that the Tathagata carries the Dharma, and since the person who upholds the sutra spreads the Dharma, the Buddha respects the Dharma, and since he carries the Dharma that is spread, he also carries the person who spreads it.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c08_15']	就偈頌為三：	就偈頌為三：	009	The verses are divided into three parts:

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c11_12']	就初兩偈又開二別：	就初兩偈又開二別：	009	In the first two verses, there are two further distinctions:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c12_15']	第一偈上半，明欲成就自然智者，此是無功用智也。	第一偈上半，明欲成就自然智者，此是無功用智也。	009	In the first verse, the first half clarifies that those who wish to accomplish natural wisdom are those with effortless wisdom;

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c14_13']	一切種智照有智也，慧者一切智照空慧也。	一切種智照有智也，慧者一切智照空慧也。	009	The wisdom of all kinds illuminates the wisdom of existence, and the wisdom of all illuminates the wisdom of emptiness.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c17_19']	次三行，頌佛滅後二種法師。	次三行，頌佛滅後二種法師。	009	The next three lines praise the two kinds of Dharma teachers after the Buddha's extinction.

The Buddha is not like this, so it surpasses the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0585c24_11']	而《智度論》云供養十方補處菩薩，不及佛者，此約福田優劣判也。	而《智度論》云供養十方補處菩薩，不及佛者，此約福田優劣判也。	009	However, the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says that offering to the bodhisattvas who are about to become Buddhas in the ten directions is not as good as offering to the Buddha. This is based on the superiority and inferiority of the field of blessings to make a judgment.

If one has not yet heard the Fahua Sutra revealing the provisional to show the real, and has not yet thoroughly understood the provisional and real of the Way, then practicing the bodhisattva path is still full of confusion, either thinking of advancing to accomplish Buddhahood or possibly regressing to abide in the two vehicles, thus it is called bad practice;

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c03_2']	又不聞此經明身權身實，則不深厭生死、欣樂佛身，亦是未善行義；	又不聞此經明身權身實，則不深厭生死、欣樂佛身，亦是未善行義；	009	Moreover, if one has not heard this sutra explaining the provisional and the real in the body, then one does not deeply detest samsara and delight in the Buddha's body, which is also the meaning of not being skillful in practice;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c03_11']	與此相違名善行也。	與此相違名善行也。	009	Contra this, it is called skillful practice.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c10_16']	一者、就《法華》之前明去佛道遠義；	一者、就《法華》之前明去佛道遠義；	009	First, in terms of the meaning of being far from the Buddha way before the Lotus Sutra;

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c12_9']	一者、於二乘教中求佛去道遠也。	一者、於二乘教中求佛去道遠也。	009	First, seeking the Buddha way in the teachings of the two vehicles is far;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c13_10']	故《大品》云「以聲聞經求菩提者名為不黠」也。	故《大品》云「以聲聞經求菩提者名為不黠」也。	009	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says Those who seek bodhi through the sūtras of the śrāvakas are called unwise.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c16_13']	二者、三藏後諸大乘經未廢二乘者，於此教中求佛道亦有遠義，以此教中明大乘，乃與法華不異，但未廢二乘，則始行菩薩猶未精識權實；	二者、三藏後諸大乘經未廢二乘者，於此教中求佛道亦有遠義，以此教中明大乘，乃與法華不異，但未廢二乘，則始行菩薩猶未精識權實；	009	Second, after the Tripiṭaka, in the Mahāyāna sūtras that have not yet abolished the two vehicles, seeking the Buddha way in this teaching also has the meaning of distance. Because in this teaching, it is explained that the Mahāyāna is no different from the Lotus Sūtra, but it has not yet abolished the two vehicles, so the newly practicing bodhisattvas still do not thoroughly understand the provisional and the real;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c18_3']	又猶有迴遑之望，則求佛之心不決定，約此一邊則有求佛遠也。	又猶有迴遑之望，則求佛之心不決定，約此一邊則有求佛遠也。	009	Moreover, if there is still a vague hope, then the mind seeking Buddhahood is not determined. From this perspective, there is still a distance in seeking Buddhahood.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0586c18_22']	「施功不已」者，聞《法華經》生聞慧也。	「施功不已」者，聞《法華經》生聞慧也。	009	Not ceasing to make effort refers to giving rise to the wisdom of hearing upon hearing the Lotus Sutra.

Just as in the Flower Ornament Sutra, after the teaching in the seven locations and eight assemblies was finished, bodhisattvas from the ten directions came to serve as witnesses.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a03_2']	一者、化主不同。	一者、化主不同。	009	First, the main agents of transformation are different.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a04_17']	說初分經但以釋迦一佛為化主，說後分經則有多佛，謂十方分身及過去多寶。	說初分經但以釋迦一佛為化主，說後分經則有多佛，謂十方分身及過去多寶。	009	In teaching the first part of the sutra, it is only Shakyamuni Buddha who is the main agent of transformation. In teaching the last part of the sutra, there are many Buddhas, namely the Buddhas from the ten directions who are manifestations of the Buddha and the many treasures of the past.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a06_8']	所以然者，說初分經但明所乘之法、未論能乘之人，故不須多佛；	所以然者，說初分經但明所乘之法、未論能乘之人，故不須多佛；	009	The reason for this is that the first part of the sutra only clarifies the Dharma that is to be ridden, and does not yet discuss the person who can ride it, so there is no need for many Buddhas;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a07_5']	說後分經正論能乘之人，故須明多佛。	說後分經正論能乘之人，故須明多佛。	009	The latter part of the sutra正 discusses the person who can ride it, so it clarifies many Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a09_7']	集十方分身欲顯本一迹多，開於寶塔示真實應滅，是故初分經但明一佛，後分經辨多佛也。	集十方分身欲顯本一迹多，開於寶塔示真實應滅，是故初分經但明一佛，後分經辨多佛也。	009	The section on gathering the bodies from the ten directions is to show the one original and many traces, and to open the jeweled stupa to show the true and real extinction, therefore the first part of the sutra only clarifies one Buddha, and the latter part of the sutra discusses many Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a09_16']	二者、說處淨穢異。	二者、說處淨穢異。	009	Second, the pure and impure differences in the place of speaking.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a10_15']	說初分經在穢土中，明後分經居淨土中說。	說初分經在穢土中，明後分經居淨土中說。	009	The first part of the sutra is spoken amidst the defiled lands, while the latter part of the sutra is spoken amidst the pure lands.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a11_16']	故《法華論》云「示現國土無上故現多寶塔」。	故《法華論》云「示現國土無上故現多寶塔」。	009	Therefore the Fahua lun says: In order to show the unsurpassedness of the lands, the many jeweled stupas are manifested.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a12_12']	所以然者，說初分經未集分身故不變淨；	所以然者，說初分經未集分身故不變淨；	009	The reason for this is that the first part of the sutra has not yet gathered the bodies, so it does not transform into purity;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a13_7']	說後分經普集分身所以變淨。	說後分經普集分身所以變淨。	009	The latter part of the sutra universally gathers the bodies, so it transforms into purity.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a15_5']	又說前分經雖開乘權乘實猶覆身權身實，眾生心垢一半猶自未淨，故土猶穢也；	又說前分經雖開乘權乘實猶覆身權身實，眾生心垢一半猶自未淨，故土猶穢也；	009	It is also said that although the previous part of the sutra reveals the provisional and true vehicles, it still conceals the provisional and true bodies, and half of the mental defilements of sentient beings have not yet been purified, so the land is still defiled;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a16_12']	至後分經俱弊二權、雙開兩實，則心垢悉除，故國土清淨也。	至後分經俱弊二權、雙開兩實，則心垢悉除，故國土清淨也。	009	When it reaches the later part of the sutra, both of the two provisional [teachings] are discarded, and the two true [teachings] are both revealed, then the mental defilements are all removed, so the land is pure.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a17_1']	三者、說處空有異。	三者、說處空有異。	009	Third, there is a difference in the empty and existent locations of the teachings.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a18_6']	說初分經在於靈山有處，說後分經能化所化並昇虛空。	說初分經在於靈山有處，說後分經能化所化並昇虛空。	009	The teaching of the first part of the sutra is in the spiritual mountain with a location, while the teaching of the later part of the sutra is that both the teacher and the taught ascend into the sky.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a20_1']	所以然者，說初分經寶塔未現故在地說法，後分經寶塔昇空故處空說法。	所以然者，說初分經寶塔未現故在地說法，後分經寶塔昇空故處空說法。	009	The reason for this is that the teaching of the first part of the sutra has not yet revealed the jeweled stupa, so the Dharma is taught on the ground; the teaching of the later part of the sutra has the jeweled stupa ascending into the sky, so the Dharma is taught in the sky.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a21_5']	又說初分經未辨佛身無生滅，由明有生滅故在有處；	又說初分經未辨佛身無生滅，由明有生滅故在有處；	009	Moreover, the teaching of the first part of the sutra has not yet distinguished the Buddha's body as being without birth and cessation, because it speaks of having birth and cessation, so it is in a location with existence;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a22_10']	說後分經顯法身如虛空、方便有生滅，故昇空說法也。	說後分經顯法身如虛空、方便有生滅，故昇空說法也。	009	The teaching of the later part of the sutra reveals the Dharma body to be like empty space, and the skillful means have birth and cessation, so the Dharma is taught while ascending into the sky.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a22_17']	四者、徒眾異。	四者、徒眾異。	009	Fourth, there is a difference in the assembly.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a23_14']	說初分經菩薩眾少，說後分經受道眾多。	說初分經菩薩眾少，說後分經受道眾多。	009	In the first part of the sutra, the assembly of bodhisattvas is small, while in the latter part of the sutra, the assembly of those who receive the Way is numerous.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a25_3']	所以然者，說初分經但為三根聲聞、未正為菩薩，故菩薩眾少；	所以然者，說初分經但為三根聲聞、未正為菩薩，故菩薩眾少；	009	The reason for this is that in expounding the first part of the sutra, it is only for the three types of śrāvakas, not directly for bodhisattvas, so the assembly of bodhisattvas is small;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a26_14']	說後分經欲顯釋迦成佛已久，故明涌出菩薩眾多，顯釋迦成佛已久。	說後分經欲顯釋迦成佛已久，故明涌出菩薩眾多，顯釋迦成佛已久。	009	In expounding the latter part of the sutra, it is to show that Śākyamuni has long since attained Buddhahood, so it clarifies that the assembly of bodhisattvas who emerge from the earth is numerous, showing that Śākyamuni has long since attained Buddhahood.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a27_17']	又明法身果德，令菩薩修習取證，故辨菩薩眾多。	又明法身果德，令菩薩修習取證，故辨菩薩眾多。	009	Moreover, it clarifies the fruition of the Dharma-body, causing bodhisattvas to cultivate and realize it, so it distinguishes the assembly of many bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588a28_18']	又說初分經有三乘雜眾，說後分經但有菩薩眾。	又說初分經有三乘雜眾，說後分經但有菩薩眾。	009	Moreover, in expounding the first part of the sutra, there is a mixed assembly of the three vehicles, while in expounding the latter part of the sutra, there is only an assembly of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b01_1']	所以然者，說初分經正會三歸一故列三乘眾；	所以然者，說初分經正會三歸一故列三乘眾；	009	The reason for this is that in expounding the first part of the sutra, it is to gather the three into one, so it lists the assembly of the three vehicles;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b02_11']	說後分經會三已竟，故但令菩薩修因證於佛果，故但有菩薩眾也。	說後分經會三已竟，故但令菩薩修因證於佛果，故但有菩薩眾也。	009	In expounding the latter part of the sutra, the gathering of the three is already complete, so it only causes bodhisattvas to cultivate causes and realize the fruition of Buddhahood, so there is only an assembly of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b03_15']	五者、時節異，說初分經時節即短，說後分經時節即長。	五者、時節異，說初分經時節即短，說後分經時節即長。	009	Fifth, the difference in time. The time for expounding the first part of the sūtra is short, while the time for expounding the latter part of the sūtra is long.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b05_17']	所以然者，說初分經未明涌出菩薩問訊於佛故時節即短，後分經明涌出眾多故問訊時久。	所以然者，說初分經未明涌出菩薩問訊於佛故時節即短，後分經明涌出眾多故問訊時久。	009	The reason for this is that when expounding the first part of the sūtra, it does not yet clarify the bodhisattvas emerging from the earth inquiring about the Buddha's well-being, so the time is short. In the latter part of the sūtra, it clarifies the multitude of emerging bodhisattvas, so the time of inquiring about the Buddha's well-being is long.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b07_19']	又明問訊時久顯涌出眾多，以涌出眾多顯釋迦成佛來久，初分未辨斯義，故不辨時長也。	又明問訊時久顯涌出眾多，以涌出眾多顯釋迦成佛來久，初分未辨斯義，故不辨時長也。	009	Moreover, clarifying the long time of inquiring about the Buddha's well-being reveals the multitude of emerging bodhisattvas, and using the multitude of emerging bodhisattvas reveals that Śākyamuni's attainment of Buddhahood has been long. The first part does not discern this meaning, so it does not discern the long time.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b08_6']	六者、請主異。	六者、請主異。	009	Sixth, the difference in the host of the request.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b09_6']	說初分經聲聞為請主，說後分經彌勒為請主。	說初分經聲聞為請主，說後分經彌勒為請主。	009	In expounding the first part of the sūtra, the śrāvakas are the host of the request. In expounding the latter part of the sūtra, Maitreya is the host of the request.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b10_19']	所以然者，說乘權乘實正會三歸一，令聲聞人迴小入大，故聲聞為請主；	所以然者，說乘權乘實正會三歸一，令聲聞人迴小入大，故聲聞為請主；	009	The reason for this is that in expounding the provisional and true teachings of the vehicle, it is precisely reconciling the three into one, causing the śrāvaka people to turn from the small and enter the great, so the śrāvakas are the host of the request;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b12_13']	說後分經明身權身實，使窮學菩薩得證如來無生法身，故彌勒為請主也。	說後分經明身權身實，使窮學菩薩得證如來無生法身，故彌勒為請主也。	009	The Sutra of the Later Part clarifies the provisional and real bodies, enabling bodhisattvas of the final stage to realize the Tathagata's unconditioned Dharma body, thus Maitreya is the one who requests the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b12_20']	七者、說法異。	七者、說法異。	009	Seventh, the teaching is different.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b14_15']	說所乘之法，但明釋迦一期始終教門，說法則略；	說所乘之法，但明釋迦一期始終教門，說法則略；	009	Explaining the Dharma that is ridden only clarifies Shakyamuni's teaching methods from beginning to end in one lifetime, the explanation of the Dharma is brief;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b16_7']	能乘之人，自從過去得道之初乃至窮未來劫一切諸教，故說法則廣。	能乘之人，自從過去得道之初乃至窮未來劫一切諸教，故說法則廣。	009	The person who can ride it, from the initial attainment of the Way in the past up to the future kalpas, all the teachings, therefore the explanation of the Dharma is extensive.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b19_10']	說身權身實令無數菩薩得十二種甚深之利，又得益則多。	說身權身實令無數菩薩得十二種甚深之利，又得益則多。	009	Explaining the provisional and real bodies allows countless bodhisattvas to attain the twelve kinds of profound benefits, and the beneficiaries are many.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b20_18']	所以然者，說初分經但開乘權乘實猶覆身權身實，故利益則少；	所以然者，說初分經但開乘權乘實猶覆身權身實，故利益則少；	009	The reason for this is that in the first part of the sutra, only the provisional and real vehicles are discussed, and the provisional and real bodies are still concealed, so the benefits are few;
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0588b23_3']	說後分經俱廢二權、雙顯兩實，故教不纖隱、理無毫翳，故應得道者皆並領悟，是故得益者多也。	說後分經俱廢二權、雙顯兩實，故教不纖隱、理無毫翳，故應得道者皆並領悟，是故得益者多也。	009	In the latter part of the sutra, both provisional vehicles are abandoned and both real vehicles are revealed, so the teaching is not subtly hidden and the principle is not obscured in the slightest, so those who should attain the Way all understand it, and therefore many receive benefits.

This is the opening of the provisional gate and revealing the true reality of the Dharma body.

In the past, the two provisional [vehicles] covered the two real [vehicles], which is likened to defilement and darkness. Now, both provisional [vehicles] are abandoned and the two real [vehicles] are both revealed. Since the meaning is already clear, it is represented by the white tuft of hair.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591a29_6']	三、小乘人執權迷實不信一乘，故《智度論》云「五百部聞畢竟空如刀傷心」，況聞有一無三也。	三、小乘人執權迷實不信一乘，故《智度論》云「五百部聞畢竟空如刀傷心」，況聞有一無三也。	009	Third, followers of the Lesser Vehicle who are attached to the provisional and confused about the true, and do not believe in the One Vehicle. Therefore, the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says, The five hundred schools hear of ultimate emptiness as if a knife has wounded their hearts, let alone hearing that there is one and not three.

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591b15_9']	今次開違方便用，亦有二人：	今次開違方便用，亦有二人：	009	Now, next, opening the use of the skillful means of opposition also has two people:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591b15_21']	一、調達，謂人為違方便；	一、調達，謂人為違方便；	009	One is Devadatta, referring to people as the use of the skillful means of opposition;

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591b21_1']	二者、上品明過去多寶自來證明《法華》，今此品釋迦引調達為證明，由調達過去世為我說《法華經》今得成佛，是故法華功力深重宜須信持。	二者、上品明過去多寶自來證明《法華》，今此品釋迦引調達為證明，由調達過去世為我說《法華經》今得成佛，是故法華功力深重宜須信持。	009	Second, the previous chapter clarified that Prabhūtaratna from the past came to bear witness to the Lotus Sutra. In this chapter, Śākyamuni cites Devadatta as a witness. Because Devadatta in a past life expounded the Lotus Sutra for me, he has now attained Buddhahood. Therefore, the power of the Lotus Sutra is profound and weighty, and one should believe and uphold it.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591b22_3']	故上是引他證，今引自證，是以兩品相次來也。	故上是引他證，今引自證，是以兩品相次來也。	009	Thus, the previous chapter is a witness from others, and this chapter cites a witness from oneself. This is why the two chapters come one after the other.

Because the sutra itself has these three powers, one should believe and uphold it. Therefore, citing the three powers explains and confirms the four exhortations. This is why this chapter comes.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591b27_1']	次、生後者，凡有四義：	次、生後者，凡有四義：	009	Next, as for giving rise to what follows, there are four meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591b28_5']	一者、上以多寶不滅示滅，顯釋迦方便生滅實無生滅；	一者、上以多寶不滅示滅，顯釋迦方便生滅實無生滅；	009	First, previously it showed how Prabhūtaratna, who is not extinguished, demonstrates extinction, revealing that Śākyamuni's expedient birth and extinction are actually without birth and extinction.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c01_19']	今復舉調達例顯釋迦，調達非惡示惡，故惡是方便、善為真實，類顯釋迦不生滅示生滅，故生滅是方便、不生滅為真實。	今復舉調達例顯釋迦，調達非惡示惡，故惡是方便、善為真實，類顯釋迦不生滅示生滅，故生滅是方便、不生滅為真實。	009	Now it again cites Devadatta as an example to reveal Śākyamuni. Devadatta, who is not evil, demonstrates evil, so evil is expedient and good is true. This reveals how Śākyamuni, who is not born and extinguished, demonstrates birth and extinction, so birth and extinction are expedient and non-birth and non-extinction are true.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c03_10']	故上以他佛顯於釋迦，今引他菩薩顯於釋迦，是以兩品相次來也。	故上以他佛顯於釋迦，今引他菩薩顯於釋迦，是以兩品相次來也。	009	Therefore, previously it used other Buddhas to reveal Śākyamuni, and now it cites other Bodhisattvas to reveal Śākyamuni. This is why the two chapters come one after the other.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c04_16']	二者、為成信義故來，如《涅槃．師子吼品》說「云何為信？	二者、為成信義故來，如《涅槃．師子吼品》說「云何為信？	009	Second, it comes to establish the meaning of faith. As the Nirvana Sutra's chapter on the Lion's Roar says, What is faith?
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c06_7']	信如來畢竟不生滅，信提婆達多終不破僧」，涅槃既兩事相次，今亦然也。	信如來畢竟不生滅，信提婆達多終不破僧」，涅槃既兩事相次，今亦然也。	009	Faith that the Tathagata is ultimately unborn and unextinguished, faith that Devadatta will never destroy the Sangha. Since Nirvana has these two things coming one after the other, so is it now.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c07_4']	故說此品以違順相對，故二品相次也。	故說此品以違順相對，故二品相次也。	009	Therefore, this chapter speaks of going against and going along with each other, so the two chapters come one after the other.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c08_8']	三者、然流通勸信皆是為始學耳，若深行人無勞勸也。	三者、然流通勸信皆是為始學耳，若深行人無勞勸也。	009	Third, the encouragement to circulate and believe is only for beginners, those of deep practice do not need encouragement.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c10_12']	今為接惡人自輕己身不敢學大法，是故今說調達雖是惡人，得聞大乘受記成佛，故應須學之。	今為接惡人自輕己身不敢學大法，是故今說調達雖是惡人，得聞大乘受記成佛，故應須學之。	009	Now, in order to reach out to evil people who belittle themselves and dare not study the great Dharma, it is said that Devadatta, although an evil person, heard the Mahayana and received the prediction of becoming a Buddha, therefore one should study it.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c12_1']	四者、根緣不同適時而說，以眾中應聞此品得悟、故應機說之。	四者、根緣不同適時而說，以眾中應聞此品得悟、故應機說之。	009	Fourth, the faculties and conditions are different, and the teaching is given according to the time. Since those in the assembly should hear this chapter and attain enlightenment, it is taught according to their capacities.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c13_16']	提婆達多是斛飯王子，提婆此翻為天，達多言熱，以其生時諸天心熱故名天熱。	提婆達多是斛飯王子，提婆此翻為天，達多言熱，以其生時諸天心熱故名天熱。	009	Devadatta is the prince of Pūrṇāśa. Devadatta means heaven and hot. Because when he was born, the minds of the gods were hot, he was named Hot in Heaven.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c15_10']	所以然者，諸天知其造三逆罪破壞佛法，見其初生心生熱惱故因以為名。	所以然者，諸天知其造三逆罪破壞佛法，見其初生心生熱惱故因以為名。	009	The reason for this is that the gods knew he would commit three heinous crimes and destroy the Buddha's teachings. Seeing his birth, their minds became agitated, and thus he was named.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c16_3']	此品歎經三力即為三段：	此品歎經三力即為三段：	009	This chapter praises the three powers of the sutra, which are divided into three parts:

['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c19_9']	由文殊說《法華經》，無量無邊眾生並得悟道，故歎《法華》有廣大力。	由文殊說《法華經》，無量無邊眾生並得悟道，故歎《法華》有廣大力。	009	Because Mañjuśrī expounded the Lotus Sūtra, countless sentient beings all attained enlightenment, so praising the Lotus Sūtra has the power of vastness.
['ZH_T34_1721_009:0591c20_6']	龍女聞經現身成佛，故歎此經有速疾力。	龍女聞經現身成佛，故歎此經有速疾力。	009	The dragon girl heard the sūtra and manifested her body as a Buddha, so praising this sūtra has the power of speed.
