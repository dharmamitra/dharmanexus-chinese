['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a17_4']	是故如理之言，世尊於般若波羅蜜多中正說。	是故如理之言，世尊於般若波羅蜜多中正說。	Therefore, the words of proper principles were correctly spoken by the World-Honored One in the Perfection of Wisdom.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a18_15']	頌言「淨性」者，謂即如理自性清淨光明，而能對治彼不清淨諸有散亂。	頌言「淨性」者，謂即如理自性清淨光明，而能對治彼不清淨諸有散亂。	The verse says the nature of purity means that which is of the nature of proper principles, intrinsically pure, luminous, and able to counteract those impure various distractions.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a20_2']	頌言「亦然」者即聚集義，此一性等性所有聚集量不可得。	頌言「亦然」者即聚集義，此一性等性所有聚集量不可得。	The verse says also thus which means the meaning of aggregation. The quantity of the nature of this singularity, etc., cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a21_8']	如理之言即如量義，體即無二之智，彼能對治，此為決定。	如理之言即如量義，體即無二之智，彼能對治，此為決定。	The words in accordance with principle mean the meaning of in accordance with quantity. The essence is the wisdom of non-duality. That is able to counteract, this is the determination.

['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a22_8']	此說比量不可得故。	此說比量不可得故。	This is said to be the non-attainability of inference.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a23_5']	所有自受，非他相所增，如樂等自受。	所有自受，非他相所增，如樂等自受。	All self-experience is not increased by the characteristics of others, like the self-experience of pleasure, etc.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a24_16']	若言論安立，即如實智自性所得，相違他相有增自受不成對治量故。	若言論安立，即如實智自性所得，相違他相有增自受不成對治量故。	If it is said that the establishment of the treatise is the essence obtained by the wisdom of suchness, the characteristics of others that contradict it are not able to increase the self-experience, because it is not the measure of the antidote.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a25_16']	此中非彼所知青等相一多性異，有分別故。	此中非彼所知青等相一多性異，有分別故。	In this, the characteristics of blue, etc., which are known by them, are not different in singularity and multiplicity, because there is discrimination.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a27_11']	是故決定觀察自受成就，所行悲愍，即非外門所照現性，不為他相有增動亂。	是故決定觀察自受成就，所行悲愍，即非外門所照現性，不為他相有增動亂。	Therefore, it is determined that the accomplishment of self-experience is practiced with compassion, which is not the nature that is illuminated by the external gate, and is not disturbed by the increase of the characteristics of others.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a27_15']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a28_11']	所有青等諸相，勝義諦中無實性故。	所有青等諸相，勝義諦中無實性故。	All the characteristics such as blue, etc., do not have true reality in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910a29_6']	此唯有智如實了知，此無過失。	此唯有智如實了知，此無過失。	This is only the wisdom that truly understands, and there is no fault in this.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b02_3']	若於外事如其自受，以如是義有所安立，即不如義，此有過失，而非決定見邊成就。	若於外事如其自受，以如是義有所安立，即不如義，此有過失，而非決定見邊成就。	If regarding external things, as one's own experience, there is an establishment of such meaning, then it is not the meaning, and there is a fault, but it is not the accomplishment of seeing the extreme of certainty.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b02_7']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b03_10']	以樂等受於外諸處無有性故，亦非異處有所伺察。	以樂等受於外諸處無有性故，亦非異處有所伺察。	Because the nature of pleasant feelings, etc., does not exist in the external sense bases, and it is also not observed elsewhere.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b04_9']	此中樂等受，即樂等自性受，非樂等相受。	此中樂等受，即樂等自性受，非樂等相受。	Herein, pleasant feelings, etc., are the self-nature of pleasant feelings, etc., not the characteristics of pleasant feelings, etc.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b05_12']	此等所說即離能取所取二相之智，此非別異所有。	此等所說即離能取所取二相之智，此非別異所有。	These explanations are the wisdom that is apart from the two characteristics of the grasper and the grasped. This is not something separate.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b05_14']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b06_15']	若今無彼能取、所取識者，云何於後有彼識性？	若今無彼能取、所取識者，云何於後有彼識性？	If now there is no consciousness of the grasper and the grasped, how can there be that consciousness-nature later?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b06_17']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b08_1']	此中但離能取、所取相，彼後識相雖有，而非語言表示。	此中但離能取、所取相，彼後識相雖有，而非語言表示。	Herein, it is only apart from the characteristics of the grasper and the grasped. Although the characteristics of that later consciousness exist, they are not expressed by language.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b09_4']	彼有之性真實表示，如理和合，是故此說彼一切識。	彼有之性真實表示，如理和合，是故此說彼一切識。	The true indication of the nature of their existence is in accordance with the combination of principles, therefore this is said to be all their consciousnesses.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b09_18']	若比量智，而非此中和合所成。	若比量智，而非此中和合所成。	If inferential cognition is not accomplished by this combination,
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b10_2']	何以故？	何以故？	why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b10_18']	以彼無二之相，非有二相領受所行。	以彼無二之相，非有二相領受所行。	Because that which is non-dual in nature is not experienced as having a dual nature.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b12_6']	若有二相彼量不成，以彼二相而為對礙，如執兔角豈非過失。	若有二相彼量不成，以彼二相而為對礙，如執兔角豈非過失。	If it has a dual nature, that cognition is not established, because those two natures are mutually exclusive, just as grasping rabbit horns would not be a mistake.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b12_10']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b13_10']	非能取聲中說有智相，以彼決定無有性故。	非能取聲中說有智相，以彼決定無有性故。	The sound of the subject does not speak of the nature of cognition, because that is definitely without nature.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b15_15']	然以彼識於外青等諸相而有對礙，彼一多伺察有堪任性，非真實意，而亦非識離勝義諦有所取故。	然以彼識於外青等諸相而有對礙，彼一多伺察有堪任性，非真實意，而亦非識離勝義諦有所取故。	However, that consciousness is mutually exclusive with external blue and other characteristics, and there is a capacity for observation of one or many, which is not the true mind, and also is not consciousness apart from ultimate truth, because there is something to be grasped.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b17_2']	彼無性等樂取決定所有智相體性，此為能取、此為所取；	彼無性等樂取決定所有智相體性，此為能取、此為所取；	That naturelessness and so forth happily grasp the determined nature of cognition, this is the subject, this is the object;
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b19_10']	此說無彼能取之相，以體及業互相樂取決定性故，非智相自受中說能取聲，亦無智相互相樂取決定自理。	此說無彼能取之相，以體及業互相樂取決定性故，非智相自受中說能取聲，亦無智相互相樂取決定自理。	This is said to be without the characteristics of the grasper, because the essence and function mutually delight in grasping the determined nature. The sound of the grasper is not spoken of within the self-experience of the characteristics of cognition, and there is also no mutual delight in grasping the self-reason of the characteristics of cognition.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b21_7']	如是如所生性故，彼如是智相自受中而正安立，如其所說離能取、所取之性。	如是如所生性故，彼如是智相自受中而正安立，如其所說離能取、所取之性。	In this way, because of the nature that is produced, within the self-experience of the characteristics of such cognition, it is correctly established as it is said, apart from the nature of grasper and grasped.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b22_13']	此說為無二，即智相自受現量成就，非一切真實顯示和合。	此說為無二，即智相自受現量成就，非一切真實顯示和合。	This is said to be non-dual, which is the accomplishment of the direct perception of the self-experience of the characteristics of cognition, not the display and combination of all that is real.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b24_13']	若復執彼決定無分位性，即無二智相中有所動亂，種子隨生，不隨智相無二對現所生。	若復執彼決定無分位性，即無二智相中有所動亂，種子隨生，不隨智相無二對現所生。	If one further grasps that there is no determined state of existence, then there is disturbance within the non-dual characteristics of cognition. The seeds arise according to their kind, not according to the non-dual characteristics of cognition that are produced.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b27_1']	若執決定無二之相，此中還成執著分別，非此智相同法之中而得成就，是故所有一切義中而成毀謗。	若執決定無二之相，此中還成執著分別，非此智相同法之中而得成就，是故所有一切義中而成毀謗。	If one grasps the determined non-dual characteristics, then here it still becomes conceptual attachment. Within the same characteristics of cognition, it is not accomplished. Therefore, all meanings become slander.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b27_19']	當知世俗及勝義性，決定如是無所有義。	當知世俗及勝義性，決定如是無所有義。	One should know that the conventional and ultimate natures are definitely like this, without any meaning of existence.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910b29_2']	此中顯明義者，如佛所說智即是明，世俗即無明。	此中顯明義者，如佛所說智即是明，世俗即無明。	Here, the meaning of manifestation is as the Buddha said, wisdom is precisely manifestation, and the conventional is precisely ignorance.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c01_2']	若明若無明，智如實知別異種類，亦無所生。	若明若無明，智如實知別異種類，亦無所生。	Whether it is manifestation or ignorance, wisdom truly knows the different kinds, and also does not give rise to anything.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c02_3']	是故彼等如實不顛倒相，即智明相而為對治。	是故彼等如實不顛倒相，即智明相而為對治。	Therefore, their true and non-erroneous characteristics are precisely the characteristics of the manifestation of wisdom, which serve as antidotes.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c04_18']	當知決定，若彼勝義諦中決定無自性者，如虛空雲彼非對治，以彼所有如理對治真實所行得相應故，如熱自性冷物對治。	當知決定，若彼勝義諦中決定無自性者，如虛空雲彼非對治，以彼所有如理對治真實所行得相應故，如熱自性冷物對治。	One should know that if in the ultimate truth there is definitely no intrinsic nature, like clouds in the sky, they are not antidotes, because their proper antidotes truly accord with the characteristics of practice, like the antidote of cold things to the intrinsic nature of heat.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c05_11']	此不實義表示，無明亦然。	此不實義表示，無明亦然。	This unreal meaning is indicated, and ignorance is also like this.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c08_7']	以如實義說者，此無二智自性因中有其多種，若此中決定彼世俗相計有性者，此不可說，於所行中即有二相，智實無二。	以如實義說者，此無二智自性因中有其多種，若此中決定彼世俗相計有性者，此不可說，於所行中即有二相，智實無二。	If we speak from the perspective of the true meaning, this non-dual wisdom has many kinds of natures and causes. If here there is a definite conventional characteristic that conceives of existence, this cannot be said. Within the objects of activity, there are indeed two characteristics, but wisdom is truly non-dual.

['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c09_18']	若如前言智即是明、世俗即無明者，如是所說豈非此中自語相違邪？	若如前言智即是明、世俗即無明者，如是所說豈非此中自語相違邪？	If, as you have previously stated, wisdom is precisely illumination and convention is precisely ignorance, is this not a contradiction in terms in this context?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c10_10']	以明自性異世俗有性故。	以明自性異世俗有性故。	Because the nature of illumination is different from the nature of conventional existence.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c10_12']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c11_13']	明之無二相即是勝義性，此如是說正理成就。	明之無二相即是勝義性，此如是說正理成就。	The non-dual characteristic of illumination is precisely the nature of the ultimate truth. This is a correct statement of the true principle.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c13_5']	若世俗所欲領受，古師仙人於此語中亦有異義，如餘處說此不復引。	若世俗所欲領受，古師仙人於此語中亦有異義，如餘處說此不復引。	If one wishes to accept the conventional, the ancient sages and seers also have different opinions in this statement, as explained elsewhere and will not be repeated here.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c14_2']	此中如後正理，頌言「性無性違等」。	此中如後正理，頌言「性無性違等」。	Here, it is as explained later in the true principle, with the verse saying The contradiction between existence and non-existence, etc.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c14_13']	所言「等」者即攝集義。	所言「等」者即攝集義。	The word etc. means to include.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c15_8']	非唯如前所說正理，離分別智對治散亂。	非唯如前所說正理，離分別智對治散亂。	Not only is it the correct principle as explained above, but it is also the antidote to the scattered mind that is apart from discriminating wisdom.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c17_9']	此有性無性相違，當知彼亦決定對治，謂如所有種種性等，無性自性離分別智即是對治。	此有性無性相違，當知彼亦決定對治，謂如所有種種性等，無性自性離分別智即是對治。	This existence and non-existence are mutually contradictory, and one should know that they are also definitely antidotes. That is to say, as it is, the various natures and so forth, the nature of non-existence is apart from discriminating wisdom, which is the antidote.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c18_8']	當知此中若性若相，由智力能顯示正義。	當知此中若性若相，由智力能顯示正義。	One should know that in this case, whether it is nature or characteristics, by the power of wisdom one can reveal the correct principle.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c18_13']	彼復云何？	彼復云何？	What is that again?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c19_8']	勝義諦中無有諸色，一性等生。	勝義諦中無有諸色，一性等生。	In the ultimate truth, there is no arising of form, a single nature, and so forth.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c20_1']	若復無所有，即種種性定見。	若復無所有，即種種性定見。	If it is also non-existent, then the definite view of various natures will be.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c21_5']	所言定者是決定義，即一性決定，以明力故作如是說。	所言定者是決定義，即一性決定，以明力故作如是說。	What is said to be definite is the meaning of certainty, which is the certainty of a single nature. Because it clarifies the power, it is said to be like this.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c21_14']	云何此中作如是說？	云何此中作如是說？	How is it said to be like this in this case?
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c21_19']	所以頌言：	所以頌言：	Therefore, the verse says:
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c22_14']	「說此色唯名，　　真實無自性；	「說此色唯名，　　真實無自性；	It is said that this form is only a name, with no true nature of its own;

['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c25_7']	」此言「唯名」等者，謂即此般若波羅蜜多中，世尊所說此色唯名。	」此言「唯名」等者，謂即此般若波羅蜜多中，世尊所說此色唯名。	The words only names and so forth refer to the fact that in this perfection of wisdom, the World-Honored One has said that this form is only a name.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c26_9']	「唯名」者，此即唯想，是故真實勝義諦中有所安立。	「唯名」者，此即唯想，是故真實勝義諦中有所安立。	Only names means this is only conceptual, therefore in the ultimate truth, there is something established.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c27_17']	然色蘊相無自性空，謂由如是因故，即自性分別，於此容受。	然色蘊相無自性空，謂由如是因故，即自性分別，於此容受。	However, the characteristics of the aggregate of form are empty of intrinsic nature, which means that due to such causes, the discrimination of intrinsic nature is accepted here.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0910c29_11']	所分別者，謂堅強性等境界自性，是故有此分別增相，乃起如是自性分別。	所分別者，謂堅強性等境界自性，是故有此分別增相，乃起如是自性分別。	That which is discriminated refers to the intrinsic nature of objects such as solidity, and therefore there is this increased appearance of discrimination, which then gives rise to such discrimination of intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0911a01_15']	如是所有自性分別容受多種，故此皆止，止謂止遣。	如是所有自性分別容受多種，故此皆止，止謂止遣。	Such various discriminations of intrinsic nature are accepted, and therefore they are all stopped. Stopping means to eliminate.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0911a02_8']	如是等說皆止自性分別散亂。	如是等說皆止自性分別散亂。	Such statements all stop the distraction of discriminating intrinsic nature.

['ZH_T25_1517_004:0911a08_2']	故上頌言「色及色自性」，此中空故。	故上頌言「色及色自性」，此中空故。	Therefore the verse above says form and the intrinsic nature of form, because this is empty.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0911a08_16']	彼如是說，遣彼自性俱相分別。	彼如是說，遣彼自性俱相分別。	They explain in this way to eliminate discernment of intrinsic nature and common characteristics.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0911a09_10']	上言「色」者，即是色之自共二相。	上言「色」者，即是色之自共二相。	The phrase form above refers to the intrinsic and common characteristics of form.
['ZH_T25_1517_004:0911a11_9']	此自共相及色自性是等皆空，於大種等俱相之中起分別增相，彼自性俱相分別對治。	此自共相及色自性是等皆空，於大種等俱相之中起分別增相，彼自性俱相分別對治。	These intrinsic and common characteristics, and the intrinsic nature of form, are all empty. In the common characteristics of the primary elements and so on, discernment of enhanced characteristics arises. The intrinsic nature and common characteristics are the antidotes to discernment.
