The specific reasons are different and do not involve the distant origin. Mañjuśrī's response to the traces still contemplates himself, and the brief and extensive decisions then repay the meaning of the question. How can one rashly show the distant origin?

Seeing horizontally in the light should give rise to the recent traces. Seeing horizontally in the light is still hidden and should be the same. But the construction of the stupa secretly indicates entering the truth. How can one then see the distant accomplishment, the emergence of the stupa, and the emanation bodies?

It clarifies that in the past speaking the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings represented wanting to enter the truth through the traces of the expedient gate. The meaning of immeasurable in the two times is no different, verifying that today after the birth one returns to the treasury, what doubt is there?

It only clarifies that when the rain of flowers in the past, it already represented the future teaching of the perfect cause and four stages. Therefore, the four are not the fruit. Contemplating today's heavenly flowers and the rain of four, one understands the assembly at that time as one cause. One cause must have the four stages as what is ascended, and the rain of four uses the meaning and heaven as what can represent.
['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0203c28_4']	第三句答眾喜瑞者，忖今同昔眾見瑞喜，冥表必行行依理教，故喜心內動圓障冥壞，改昔權人成今妙眾，人必稟教行理咸然。	第三句答眾喜瑞者，忖今同昔眾見瑞喜，冥表必行行依理教，故喜心內動圓障冥壞，改昔權人成今妙眾，人必稟教行理咸然。	The third sentence answers the auspicious sign of the assembly's joy. Contemplating now the same as in the past, the assembly sees auspicious signs and rejoices. It implicitly shows that they will definitely practice in accordance with the teachings. Therefore, the joyful mind moves internally and the perfect obstacles are secretly destroyed. Changing from the provisional people of the past to the wonderful assembly of the present, people will certainly receive the teachings and practices, and the principles are all so.

Contemplating now the same as in the past, when seeing the earth shaking, it has already shown that it will destroy the six kinds of ignorance. Therefore, the entire buddha-realm shakes in six ways. Although the shaking has two differences in form and sound, it is contemplated with a great drum. Therefore, it is known that warning the troops will certainly destroy the great thief on the border, and the shaking of the earth will remove the ignorance of the middle principle. Therefore, the two vehicles have never had this principle in the past. The preface secretly benefits the assembly at that time, but they do not know it.
['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0204a07_2']	第五句答放光瑞者，忖今同昔覩光已表開顯道同，故以一光俱照彼此，此表釋迦彼表四佛，故知迹門不得同本。	第五句答放光瑞者，忖今同昔覩光已表開顯道同，故以一光俱照彼此，此表釋迦彼表四佛，故知迹門不得同本。	The fifth sentence answers the auspicious sign of emitting light. Contemplating now the same as in the past, seeing the light has already shown the opening and revealing of the same path. Therefore, with one light they illuminate both here and there. This shows Shakyamuni and that shows the four buddhas. Therefore, it is known that the trace teaching cannot be the same as the origin.

At first glance, it seems as brief as only conjecture, but the meaning is not so. In the brief once there is already the phrase past buddhas, it is only called brief in comparison to the extensive, not in comparison to only conjecture.

['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0204a22_3']	即以光宅三喻而從今法，故釋五句並託喻從法，先以華瑞舉於橫別以示竪總，以初句中義含四位故也。	即以光宅三喻而從今法，故釋五句並託喻從法，先以華瑞舉於橫別以示竪總，以初句中義含四位故也。	It uses the three metaphors of Guangzhai to follow the present Dharma, therefore it explains the five sentences all relying on metaphors to follow the Dharma. First, using the auspicious flower metaphor, it raises the horizontal distinctions to show the vertical generality, because the meaning in the first sentence includes the four stages.
['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0204a23_1']	故次以雨等以離前總，出四句故。	故次以雨等以離前總，出四句故。	Therefore, next, using rain, etc., it separates from the previous generality, because it brings out the four sentences.

The text only speaks from the perspective of facing verticality, so it uses the rain of flowers to illustrate the four positions, like blowing the Dharma conch to generally illustrate the change in the four positions, but specifically in the ten practices. The beating of the drum also generally illustrates the four rounds of breaking through delusions, but specifically in the ten directions. The performance is generally said to be horizontally vast and vertically profound. The vertical profundity is like each position vertically entering and pervading all positions, but specifically in the ten grounds.
['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0204b04_17']	故初雨雨乃至法義一一遍於迹門廣說，但於眾生得益不同，須從竪釋束橫從竪，故入住者且名法雨，乃至入地且名法義，是故迹門通名雨雨乃至法義，故下廣釋句句皆云「為令眾生」，所入又有超次不同，今且從次並言「今之與昔」等也。	故初雨雨乃至法義一一遍於迹門廣說，但於眾生得益不同，須從竪釋束橫從竪，故入住者且名法雨，乃至入地且名法義，是故迹門通名雨雨乃至法義，故下廣釋句句皆云「為令眾生」，所入又有超次不同，今且從次並言「今之與昔」等也。	Therefore, the first rain rain and so forth up to the Dharma meaning are all explained in detail in the traces gate. But the benefits that sentient beings receive are not the same. It is necessary to gather the horizontal from the vertical. Therefore, those who enter and abide are temporarily called the rain rain, and those who enter the grounds are temporarily called the Dharma meaning. Therefore, the traces gate is generally called rain rain and so forth up to the Dharma meaning. Therefore, the extensive explanation below says in order to cause sentient beings in each sentence. There are also differences in skipping and following in order. Now, following the order, it is said that now and in the past and so forth.

['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0204b09_6']	故知二乘鈍根菩薩昔法華前未破無明，今初入住但得名開，是故略開。	故知二乘鈍根菩薩昔法華前未破無明，今初入住但得名開，是故略開。	Therefore, it should be known that the two vehicles and dull-faculty bodhisattvas before the Lotus Sutra had not yet broken through ignorance. Now, at the beginning of entering and abiding, they only get the name opened. Therefore, it is briefly opened.
['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0204b12_7']	利根深益在第二句，故第二句容有昔時利鈍菩薩及二乘人，先密入住并於今經始入住者，並進入行俱名改號，若顯若密至今不同。	利根深益在第二句，故第二句容有昔時利鈍菩薩及二乘人，先密入住并於今經始入住者，並進入行俱名改號，若顯若密至今不同。	The sharp faculties who deeply benefit are in the second phrase, therefore the second phrase includes the bodhisattvas and two vehicles of the past who were sharp and dull, who secretly entered and abided in the past, and those who began to enter and abide in the present sutra, all advancing to practice are called changing the name, whether revealed or secret, up to the present they are not the same.

It is roughly like what is explained above regarding the primary audience and the incidental audience. It is fully explained in the Profound Text on the Wonderful Meaning of Benefits. Therefore it is known that before that time, the four names such as opening can also be understood.

Up to now it should be said that opening the seven expedient means is good, able to hear the unique wonderful name of a male, a man is a hero, as fully explained in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.

The provisional teachings are opened and the name of buddha-nature is established everywhere. The name is common but the meaning is different. Therefore, the term man is common in the five periods, but the meanings of the various teachings are different.

The initial statement slightly clear is just from the gradual increase in verbal expression, but the meaning is not so. It is said that contemplating still contemplates the extensive and brief. Therefore, it is known that the brief once again describes contemplating. In the answer, it only briefly mentions the light and auspiciousness. The light illuminating other directions corresponds to other lands.

Moreover, the text of other lands originally forms this. Therefore, it is known that contemplating is just this, and the brief once is just that. The reason for distinguishing this and that is because there is the word present Buddha in contemplating, and there is the word past in the brief once. Using the present to represent this, and using the past to represent that.

How could the Buddha's teaching of the Dharma only allow two? But using knowing to explain cultivation is not entirely appropriate, so it is only called thinking.
['ZH_T34_1719_03b:0204c21_5']	「亦信法」者，即圓二行，聞即信行，如〈隨喜〉、〈法師品〉等，知即法行如〈安樂行〉等，豈二行者全無修慧？	「亦信法」者，即圓二行，聞即信行，如〈隨喜〉、〈法師品〉等，知即法行如〈安樂行〉等，豈二行者全無修慧？	Also believing in the Dharma refers to the two practices of the perfect teaching. Hearing and then believing is practicing, like in the chapters on rejoicing and the Dharma teacher. Knowing is practicing the Dharma, like in the chapter on the practice of peace and bliss. How could the two practitioners completely lack the wisdom of cultivation?

Therefore, there are not a few such examples in the sutra text. It is because the text of the entire sutra discusses entering the Dharma without going beyond the two practices.

In the Pure Land, there is no name for evil destinies. Therefore, one should know that it is not only the color purity due to the light, but also the myriad treasures are complete. Each offering refers to the eighteen thousand lands.

Therefore, each of the four teachings has the true path. Sitting once, spontaneously in thirty-four thoughts, in accord with a single thought without adding effort, the wondrous enlightenment in two places is originally attained naturally. Others do not see it, and the great and small are confused.

The meaning can be extended to causes. Since there are four statements of original and trace being different, how could there not be a place where the original is lower and the trace is higher, the original is higher and the trace is lower, and both are lower, and the original and trace are both high?
