['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800b24_5']	第六現前地。	第六現前地。	039	The sixth ground, the ground of presence.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800b26_2']	所以來者，已說諸諦相應慧，次說緣起流轉止息相應慧，寄緣覺地，故次來也。	所以來者，已說諸諦相應慧，次說緣起流轉止息相應慧，寄緣覺地，故次來也。	039	The reason for its appearance is that after explaining the wisdom corresponding to the truths, next it explains the wisdom corresponding to the arising and cessation of dependent origination, which is entrusted to the ground of pratyekabuddhas, so it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c01_5']	又四地出世未能隨世，五地能隨而不能破染淨之見，此地觀察無染淨法界，破彼見故，故《瑜伽》云「前地雖能於生死涅槃棄捨，一向背趣作意，而未能於生死流轉如實觀察；	又四地出世未能隨世，五地能隨而不能破染淨之見，此地觀察無染淨法界，破彼見故，故《瑜伽》云「前地雖能於生死涅槃棄捨，一向背趣作意，而未能於生死流轉如實觀察；	039	Moreover, the fourth ground is supramundane and is not yet able to accord with the world, while the fifth ground is able to accord with it but is not yet able to destroy the views of defiled and pure. This ground observes the undefiled and pure dharma realm and destroys those views. Therefore, the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says: Although on the previous ground one is able to abandon the intention of one-sidedly turning away from saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, one is still not able to thoroughly investigate the arising and cessation of saṃsāra;
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c03_10']	又由於彼多生厭故，未能多住無相作意，為令此分得圓滿，故精勤修習令得圓滿，故次來也。	又由於彼多生厭故，未能多住無相作意，為令此分得圓滿，故精勤修習令得圓滿，故次來也。	039	Moreover, because one generates aversion towards it many times, one is still not able to abide for the most part in the intention of signlessness. In order to perfect this aspect, one diligently cultivates and practices in order to perfect it, so it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c04_8']	」名現前者，《莊嚴論》云「不住生死涅槃。	」名現前者，《莊嚴論》云「不住生死涅槃。	039	As for the term manifestation, the Suyama Sutra says: Not abiding in samsara or nirvana.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c04_14']	觀慧現前故。	觀慧現前故。	039	Because the observation and wisdom are manifest.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c05_1']	此約初住地。	此約初住地。	039	This refers to the initial stage of abiding.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c05_14']	以前五地雙觀故，今得現前。	以前五地雙觀故，今得現前。	039	Because the previous five stages both observe, they are now manifested.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c06_14']	」《十住論》云「降魔事已，菩薩道法皆現在前。	」《十住論》云「降魔事已，菩薩道法皆現在前。	039	 The Dashabhumika Sutra says: After subduing Mara, the bodhisattva path and Dharma all manifest.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c06_20']	」亦約初說。	」亦約初說。	039	This is also about the initial stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c08_16']	《瑜伽》引《深密》云「現前觀察諸行流轉，又於無相多修作意方得現前者，多修無相。	《瑜伽》引《深密》云「現前觀察諸行流轉，又於無相多修作意方得現前者，多修無相。	039	The Yogacarabhumi Sastra quotes the Ghanavyūha Sūtra, saying: Manifestly observing the transformation of phenomena, and also attaining manifestation through much cultivation of the mind of signlessness.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c09_8']	」此約地初觀十平等故。	」此約地初觀十平等故。	039	 This is about the initial stage of the ground, because the ten equalities are observed.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c10_9']	觀察流轉，此約地中已入地竟方觀緣起故。	觀察流轉，此約地中已入地竟方觀緣起故。	039	Observing transformation refers to the middle of the ground, because the contemplation of dependent origination is done after entering the ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c11_12']	《攝論》云「由緣起智，能令般若波羅蜜多現在前故。	《攝論》云「由緣起智，能令般若波羅蜜多現在前故。	039	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says: By the wisdom of dependent origination, one is able to manifest the perfection of wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c12_5']	」此釋正順今經約地中說。	」此釋正順今經約地中說。	039	 This explanation accords with the present sutra, which speaks of the middle of the ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c14_6']	無性釋云「謂此地中住緣起智，由此智力令無分別智而得現前，悟一切法無染無淨。	無性釋云「謂此地中住緣起智，由此智力令無分別智而得現前，悟一切法無染無淨。	039	Asvabhāva explains, It means that in this stage one abides in the wisdom of dependent origination, and by the power of this wisdom one causes non-discriminating wisdom to manifest, realizing that all dharmas are neither defiled nor pure.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c14_18']	」《唯識》同於《攝論》。	」《唯識》同於《攝論》。	039	 The Cheng weishi lun is the same as the She dasheng lun.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c16_3']	上本分云「有間般若現前者，揀後地故，故所斷障亦斷染淨。	上本分云「有間般若現前者，揀後地故，故所斷障亦斷染淨。	039	The upper part of the original chapter says, The prajñā that manifests with intervals, in order to distinguish the later stages, therefore the obstacles that are eliminated also eliminate defilement and purity.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c17_13']	」《唯識》名為麁相現行障，謂所知障中俱生一分，執有染淨麁相現行。	」《唯識》名為麁相現行障，謂所知障中俱生一分，執有染淨麁相現行。	039	 The Cheng weishi lun calls it the obstacle of the manifestation of coarse characteristics, which means that among the obstacles to that which is to be known, one part that arises together with it grasps the coarse characteristics of defilement and purity and manifests.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c19_1']	彼障六地無染淨道，入六地時便能永斷，以觀十平等故。	彼障六地無染淨道，入六地時便能永斷，以觀十平等故。	039	That obstacle obstructs the path of non-defilement and non-purity in the sixth stage. Upon entering the sixth stage, one is able to permanently eliminate it, because one contemplates the ten kinds of equality.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c19_14']	由斯六地說斷二愚及彼麁重：	由斯六地說斷二愚及彼麁重：	039	Because of this, the sixth stage is said to eliminate two kinds of delusions and their coarseness:
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c21_4']	一現觀察行流轉愚，即是此中執有染者，諸行流轉染分攝故；	一現觀察行流轉愚，即是此中執有染者，諸行流轉染分攝故；	039	The first is the delusion of presently observing the flowing and turning of activities, which is the grasping of defilement in this context, because the flowing and turning of activities is subsumed in the category of defilement;
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c22_15']	二相多現行愚，即是此中執有淨相故相觀多行，未能多時住無相觀。	二相多現行愚，即是此中執有淨相故相觀多行，未能多時住無相觀。	039	The second is the delusion of the frequent manifestation of characteristics, which is the grasping of the characteristic of purity in this stage. Therefore, one frequently practices the contemplation of characteristics and is still unable to abide for a long time in the contemplation of the absence of characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c23_11']	初愚即執苦集，後愚即執滅道。	初愚即執苦集，後愚即執滅道。	039	The first delusion is the grasping of suffering and its causes, while the second delusion is the grasping of cessation and the path.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c25_3']	本分名微細煩惱習者，執細染淨即是煩惱，形於前地故說為微；	本分名微細煩惱習者，執細染淨即是煩惱，形於前地故說為微；	039	As for the name subtle afflictions and habits in the chapter on the stage of far-reaching, the grasping of subtle defilement and purity is precisely the afflictions. It is called subtle because it is compared to the previous stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c25_14']	《唯識》形後名為麁相。	《唯識》形後名為麁相。	039	In the Cheng weishi lun, it is called coarse characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c27_6']	由斷此愚便證無染淨真如，謂此真如本性無染，亦不可說後方淨故。	由斷此愚便證無染淨真如，謂此真如本性無染，亦不可說後方淨故。	039	By eliminating this delusion, one then realizes the true suchness that is free from defilement and purity. This means that this true suchness is originally free from defilement, and it cannot be said that it is only later purified.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c29_1']	《攝論》名為無染淨法界，後成般若行，亦得自他相續無染淨果，其揆一也。	《攝論》名為無染淨法界，後成般若行，亦得自他相續無染淨果，其揆一也。	039	The She dasheng lun calls it the dharma realm free from defilement and purity. Later, in the practice of prajñā, one also attains the fruits of freedom from defilement and purity in one's own and others' continuums. The principle is the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0800c29_10']	後正釋文亦有三分：	後正釋文亦有三分：	039	The latter correctly explains the text, which also has three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a01_1']	初讚請分，九頌分二：	初讚請分，九頌分二：	039	First, the section on praise and request, which has nine verses divided into two:
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a01_7']	前八頌半讚；	前八頌半讚；	039	The first eight and a half verses are praise;
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a01_16']	後半頌請讚中分二：	後半頌請讚中分二：	039	The last half verse is the request. The praise is divided into two:
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a03_9']	初一菩薩讚餘諸天讚供，於中三，初一天眾、次一天王、後五頌半天女。	初一菩薩讚餘諸天讚供，於中三，初一天眾、次一天王、後五頌半天女。	039	The first is a bodhisattva praising, and the other celestials praising and making offerings. There are three parts: first, a group of celestials; next, a celestial king; and finally five verses by celestial maidens.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a04_6']	於中，初三句集經者敘述，標讚佛果；	於中，初三句集經者敘述，標讚佛果；	039	In this, the first three lines are the compiler's narration, indicating praise of the Buddha's fruition;
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a04_19']	「佛語」下正讚，此句讚教；	「佛語」下正讚，此句讚教；	039	The Buddha said and below is the actual praise, this line praises the teaching;
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a05_4']	次一偈讚理；	次一偈讚理；	039	next, one verse praises the principle;
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a05_10']	次三偈讚行。	次三偈讚行。	039	next, three verses praise the practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a06_10']	於中，初偈悲智無礙行、後二十度圓修行。	於中，初偈悲智無礙行、後二十度圓修行。	039	In this, the first verse is the practice of unobstructed compassion and wisdom, and the latter is the perfect practice of the ten pāramitās.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a08_14']	本絕諸惡者，見惡可除非真持戒，善達性空即般若度，分別法即方便度，智力即二度博濟兼願。	本絕諸惡者，見惡可除非真持戒，善達性空即般若度，分別法即方便度，智力即二度博濟兼願。	039	The basis is free from all evils means seeing evil as something to be eliminated is not true upholding of the precepts. Skillfully penetrating the nature of emptiness is the pāramitā of prajñā. Distinguishing the Dharma is the pāramitā of skillful means. Wisdom power is the two pāramitās of strength and vows, which comprehensively benefit others.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a09_1']	後半結默。	後半結默。	039	The latter half concludes with silence.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a09_10']	第二正說亦分為二：	第二正說亦分為二：	039	The second is the main teaching, which is also divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a09_18']	初地行、後地果。	初地行、後地果。	039	the practice of the first ground and the fruition of the ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a10_9']	前中同於前地亦有三分：	前中同於前地亦有三分：	039	In the former, which is the same as the previous ground, there are also three parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a12_12']	一勝慢對治、二「佛子至如是觀已」下明不住道行勝、三「佛子至以如是十種」下明彼果勝。	一勝慢對治、二「佛子至如是觀已」下明不住道行勝、三「佛子至以如是十種」下明彼果勝。	039	First, the supreme counteraction to pride, second, from Buddha's disciple, having contemplated in this way... it clarifies the supreme practice of the path of non-abiding, and third, from Buddha's disciple, using these ten... it clarifies the supreme fruition of that.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a13_7']	亦初分即入心，後二即住心。	亦初分即入心，後二即住心。	039	Also, the first part is the mind of entry, and the latter two are the mind of abiding.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a14_16']	住中，前即攝正心住，後即攝善現行及隨順善根迴向，至文當知。	住中，前即攝正心住，後即攝善現行及隨順善根迴向，至文當知。	039	Within abiding, the former clarifies the abiding of the mind of embracing the correct, and the latter clarifies the practice of the good and the good roots of inclination that accord with the direction of giving. One should know this when reaching the text.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a15_3']	今且依論。	今且依論。	039	Now, I will rely on the treatise.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a15_14']	然三分雖同，而漸超勝。	然三分雖同，而漸超勝。	039	Although the three parts are the same, they are gradually surpassed.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a15_19']	勝相云何？	勝相云何？	039	What are the characteristics of surpassing?
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a18_7']	謂第四地說眾生我慢解法慢治，第五地中說身淨慢治，今第六地說取染淨相慢治，所治漸細故曰勝也。	謂第四地說眾生我慢解法慢治，第五地中說身淨慢治，今第六地說取染淨相慢治，所治漸細故曰勝也。	039	It means that in the fourth ground it is said that the pride of self in sentient beings and the pride of understanding the Dharma are countered, in the fifth ground it is said that the pride of the purity of the body is countered, and now in the sixth ground it is said that the pride of grasping at the characteristics of defilement and purity is countered. The objects of counteraction are gradually subtle, thus it is called surpassing.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a21_6']	所治既細，後二亦過染淨慢者，前觀四諦苦集名染滅道為淨，又十平等隨順如道但約淨說，染相未亡對染有淨亦名取淨。	所治既細，後二亦過染淨慢者，前觀四諦苦集名染滅道為淨，又十平等隨順如道但約淨說，染相未亡對染有淨亦名取淨。	039	Since the objects of elimination are subtle, the latter two also surpass the conceit of defilement and purity. The previous contemplation of the four truths takes suffering and accumulation as defilement and cessation and path as purity. Moreover, the ten equalities that accord with the path only speak of purity in terms of the path. The characteristics of defilement have not yet been eliminated. Purity in contrast to defilement is also called grasping purity.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a23_3']	今以十染淨平等法而為能治，下觀緣起雖有染淨，悟空深故不名取慢。	今以十染淨平等法而為能治，下觀緣起雖有染淨，悟空深故不名取慢。	039	Now, using the ten dharmas of equal defilement and purity as the remedy, the subsequent contemplation of dependent origination, although having defilement and purity, is not called grasping conceit due to the profundity of the realization of emptiness.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a23_12']	今初勝慢治中分四：	今初勝慢治中分四：	039	Now, the first, the remedy for superior conceit, is divided into four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a25_14']	一牒前標後、二「何等」下徵列十心、三「菩薩如是」下結其行能、四「得明利」下辨行分齊。	一牒前標後、二「何等」下徵列十心、三「菩薩如是」下結其行能、四「得明利」下辨行分齊。	039	First, it summarizes the previous and introduces the following. Second, starting from what are, it lists the ten minds. Third, starting from the bodhisattva is like this, it concludes the function of the practice. Fourth, starting from attaining sharpness, it distinguishes the scope of the practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a26_4']	列中十句，初總、餘別。	列中十句，初總、餘別。	039	In the listing, there are ten sentences, the first is general and the rest are specific.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a28_1']	總云一切法者，論云「是十二入以三科中蘊不攝，無為處界攝盡，而處次於蘊。	總云一切法者，論云「是十二入以三科中蘊不攝，無為處界攝盡，而處次於蘊。	039	The general statement says all dharmas. The treatise says: The twelve sense fields are not included in the aggregates among the three categories. The unconditioned is completely included in the sense bases and elements, but the sense bases come after the aggregates.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801a28_16']	又名生門，順無生義，故偏舉之。	又名生門，順無生義，故偏舉之。	039	It is also called the gate of birth, in accordance with the meaning of non-birth, therefore it is mentioned specifically.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b01_17']	」言無相者，論云「自性無相故」，謂十二入緣成之相，有來即無，非推之使無，故云自性無也。	」言無相者，論云「自性無相故」，謂十二入緣成之相，有來即無，非推之使無，故云自性無也。	039	As for the word signless, the treatise says because of the signlessness of self-nature, meaning that the signs of the conditioned twelve sense fields come and go, they are not made signless through analysis, therefore it says self-nature is signless.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b02_19']	故《瑜伽》云「由有勝義自性無相平等性故。	故《瑜伽》云「由有勝義自性無相平等性故。	039	Therefore the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says because of the equality of the signlessness of the supreme truth and self-nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b03_17']	」亦同《淨名》「不念內外行於平等」等。	」亦同《淨名》「不念內外行於平等」等。	039	It is also the same as the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra saying not thinking of the internal and external, practicing equality and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b05_15']	別中九句，明九種相皆自性無，故論云「相分別對治有九種，謂體生等九，是其所治。	別中九句，明九種相皆自性無，故論云「相分別對治有九種，謂體生等九，是其所治。	039	The nine phrases in the specific explanation clarify that the nine kinds of signs are all self-natureless, therefore the treatise says the antidotes to the discrimination of signs are of nine kinds, namely the nine such as essence, arising, and so forth, which are what is to be countered.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b06_9']	無之一字是自性無，以為能治。	無之一字是自性無，以為能治。	039	The single word 'non-' is self-naturelessness, which serves as the antidote.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b07_12']	」論以初自性無貫下九句，故但顯所治相之差別。	」論以初自性無貫下九句，故但顯所治相之差別。	039	The treatise takes the initial self-naturelessness and applies it to the following nine phrases, therefore it only reveals the differences in the characteristics of what is to be countered.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b10_3']	一無體故平等者，論經云無想，論云十二入自相想，謂內六根取外六塵之相，總名為想，即十二入之體故。	一無體故平等者，論經云無想，論云十二入自相想，謂內六根取外六塵之相，總名為想，即十二入之體故。	039	The first, equal because of having no substance, the treatise says no thought, while the sutra says the characteristics of the twelve sense bases. The characteristics of the six internal sense bases grasping the six external sense objects are collectively called thought, which is the substance of the twelve sense bases.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b11_12']	今經云體想，取像為體故，亦自性無，故經云「無體故平等」。	今經云體想，取像為體故，亦自性無，故經云「無體故平等」。	039	Now the sutra says substance of thought, taking images as the substance. It is also intrinsically nonexistent, so the sutra says equal because of having no substance.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b11_17']	下皆準此。	下皆準此。	039	The following are all based on this.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b12_2']	上遣分別心。	上遣分別心。	039	Above, the discriminating mind is dismissed.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b13_6']	二生者念展轉行相，謂諸入苦果，虛妄分別為本故。	二生者念展轉行相，謂諸入苦果，虛妄分別為本故。	039	Second, the thought of the mutual characteristics of arising refers to the suffering fruits of the sense bases, which are fundamentally based on false discrimination.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b14_12']	三成者生展轉行相，謂生即苦果，從果起因，故云展轉。	三成者生展轉行相，謂生即苦果，從果起因，故云展轉。	039	Third, the mutual characteristics of the arising of accomplishment refer to birth being the suffering fruit, and from the fruit, the cause arises, thus it is called mutual.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b15_14']	上二遣染分依他，但舉緣成已顯無生無我義矣。	上二遣染分依他，但舉緣成已顯無生無我義矣。	039	The above two dismiss the defiled part of the dependent on others, merely bringing up conditioned arising to already reveal the meaning of no arising and no self.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0801b16_19']	四即遣淨相，謂本來自淨，非滅惑方淨，故平等。	四即遣淨相，謂本來自淨，非滅惑方淨，故平等。	039	Fourth, it dismisses the pure characteristics, referring to the originally inherent purity, not the purity that comes from extinguishing afflictions, thus it is equal.

Why do those who are attached to the self receive birth in the world?

It means that although bodhisattvas practice existence and give rise to wholesome conduct, using illumination as the cause, not seeking existence and not creating is not called false practice.

['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804a03_5']	若無行熏終不成種故。	若無行熏終不成種故。	039	If there were no perfuming by formations, it would never become seeds.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804a05_2']	云於諸行中植心種字，即是所引識等五種，於一剎那為行所集，無有前後。	云於諸行中植心種字，即是所引識等五種，於一剎那為行所集，無有前後。	039	Therefore, the phrase planting the seeds of mind in all formations refers to the five seeds such as consciousness that are attracted, accumulated by formations in a single moment, without any sequence.

The five are not separate from mind and are only called seeds of mind. Also, the other four are hidden and the present is spoken of.

['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804a12_10']	而《集論》中說此識支通於能引，正取業種為識支故，識種乃是名色支攝。	而《集論》中說此識支通於能引，正取業種為識支故，識種乃是名色支攝。	039	But in the Abhidharmasamuccaya-vyākhyā, this consciousness member is said to be common to both that which perfumes and that which is perfumed, because it takes the seeds of karma as the member of consciousness. The seeds of consciousness are included in the member of name-and-form.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804a13_10']	《緣起經》說通能所引，業種識種俱名識故；	《緣起經》說通能所引，業種識種俱名識故；	039	The Pratītyasamutpāda Sūtra says that it is common to both that which perfumes and that which is perfumed, because the seeds of karma and the seeds of consciousness are both called consciousness.

['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804a17_5']	論云此中起心種子者，示生老死體性者，謂未來二果以此識種為親因故。	論云此中起心種子者，示生老死體性者，謂未來二果以此識種為親因故。	039	The commentary says, Here, the seeds of mind are planted and The nature of birth and old age and death is shown. This means that the two future results take this seed of consciousness as their direct cause.

The seeds of names and expressions in the links of karmic formations, consciousness, etc. are all common to the uncontaminated, but now they are called the contaminated links because they are associated with the three contaminations.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804a20_2']	如初地中，以欲等四流起心種故。	如初地中，以欲等四流起心種故。	039	Like in the first ground, because the seeds of mind arise from the four flows such as desire, etc.

This is the thesis that the existence member generates the two fruits. Now, in order to specifically manifest the characteristics of the existence member,
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804b02_8']	《唯識》云「愛取合潤能引業種及所引因，轉名為有，俱能近有後有果故。	《唯識》云「愛取合潤能引業種及所引因，轉名為有，俱能近有後有果故。	039	the Vijñaptimātratā Sūtra says: Craving and grasping, when combined and moistened, can attract the karmic seeds and the causes that are attracted, and transform them and name them as existence, because they can both be close to the fruit of subsequent existence.

The treatise master takes the previous sutra's ignorance, therefore it says, The previous explanation is that ignorance is the covering due to the darkness and obstruction of non-wisdom.

The author points to the craving that always seeks existence and nonexistence, which is an example, and is also the contaminated [karma] mentioned above, because craving and ignorance include it.

This means that the self and what belongs to the self explain the word self, because it is not only grasping the self but also practicing karma, which is what belongs to the self.

Now, the previously discussed seeds of consciousness are hidden within the other four, and now the present activities are briefly mentioned, omitting the basis of the general retribution, in order to illustrate the meaning of the successive arising of consciousness and name-and-form.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0804c17_9']	復欲顯其通種現故，故有隱顯。	復欲顯其通種現故，故有隱顯。	039	Moreover, in order to illustrate their common seeds and present activities, there is thus concealment and manifestation.

It is said that those who do not understand the ultimate truth are deluded about the four noble truths. However, the twelve links all arise based on reality and have no self-nature, so the verse below says Contemplating the true meaning of dependent origination is emptiness.
['ZH_T35_1735_039:0805a17_6']	而無明最初，親迷諦理而起於行。	而無明最初，親迷諦理而起於行。	039	But ignorance is the first, directly deluded about the principle of the truths and giving rise to karmic formations.
