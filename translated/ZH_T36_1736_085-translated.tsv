All these various teachings are the basis of the inconceivable.

['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c11_3']	舉此五十四者，乃成會違。	舉此五十四者，乃成會違。	085	The reason for mentioning fifty-four is to resolve contradictions.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c12_10']	一向都望人五十四，兼比丘、諸乘二會，則合有五十六會。	一向都望人五十四，兼比丘、諸乘二會，則合有五十六會。	085	If we look at it from the perspective of the person alone, there are fifty-four, plus the two assemblies of bhikṣus and various vehicles, totaling fifty-six assemblies.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c13_13']	若望善財，並見五十四人，即合自有五十四會。	若望善財，並見五十四人，即合自有五十四會。	085	If we look at it from the perspective of Sudhana, he meets fifty-four people, so he should have fifty-four assemblies himself.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c14_2']	何以惟五十三？	何以惟五十三？	085	Why are there only fifty-three?
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c15_9']	故下釋云「文殊一人四會說故」，故雖五十四人，有五十五會。	故下釋云「文殊一人四會說故」，故雖五十四人，有五十五會。	085	Therefore, the following explanation says, Mañjuśrī has four assemblies and speaks in them, so although there are fifty-four people, there are fifty-five assemblies.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c16_14']	若爾，一人四會，即五十四中加三成五十七，何言五十五？	若爾，一人四會，即五十四中加三成五十七，何言五十五？	085	If that is so, then four assemblies for one person would add three to the fifty-four, making fifty-seven, so why speak of fifty-five?
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c17_17']	故次下云「德生、有德同一會故」，又減其一；	故次下云「德生、有德同一會故」，又減其一；	085	Therefore, the following says, Meru and Merudhvaja have the same assembly, so it is reduced by one;
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c18_13']	遍友不成會，又減其一，人亦五十五。	遍友不成會，又減其一，人亦五十五。	085	and because Universal Friend does not form an assembly, it is reduced by one again, so there are also fifty-five people.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c19_11']	若取遍友成一會，故善財有五十六。	若取遍友成一會，故善財有五十六。	085	If we take Universal Friend to form one assembly, then Sudhana has fifty-six.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c20_13']	兼前五十六，為遍友不成主伴，但標五十五耳。	兼前五十六，為遍友不成主伴，但標五十五耳。	085	Together with the previous fifty-six, making fifty-five, because they are not the host and companions of Maitreya, they are only listed as fifty-five.

['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c26_18']	言濫觴者，濫泛也，觴杯也。	言濫觴者，濫泛也，觴杯也。	085	As for imitation of the first flow, imitation means to imitate, and flow refers to a cup.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c27_17']	謂江出岷山，初出之源但可泛一杯而已。	謂江出岷山，初出之源但可泛一杯而已。	085	It means that the Jiang River originates from Mount Min, and when it first emerges, it can only flow into a cup.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c29_4']	所出雖少，源在於此，故雖千里萬里，而云江出岷山。	所出雖少，源在於此，故雖千里萬里，而云江出岷山。	085	Although the amount it produces is small, the source is here, so even though it travels a thousand or ten thousand miles, it is said that the Jiang River originates from Mount Min.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0662c29_16']	故雖散在諸方，而云經會。	故雖散在諸方，而云經會。	085	Therefore, although scattered in various places, it is said that the sūtras meet.

['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a04_3']	但普賢所信所證雖是一理，而約生約佛位分染淨異，故分之成二。	但普賢所信所證雖是一理，而約生約佛位分染淨異，故分之成二。	085	However, although the faith and realization of Samantabhadra are one principle, they are divided into defiled and pure differences according to the stages of sentient beings and Buddhas, and therefore they are divided into two.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a05_14']	疏「又理開體用」等者，此即三聖觀中會歸經題，理開體用，即大方廣。	疏「又理開體用」等者，此即三聖觀中會歸經題，理開體用，即大方廣。	085	The commentary states Furthermore, the principle opens up essence and function, etc. This is the convergence of the three sages' contemplation with the title of the sūtra. The opening up of the principle's essence and function is the vast and extensive.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a06_9']	大即體性包含，方廣業用周遍。	大即體性包含，方廣業用周遍。	085	Vast refers to the inherent inclusion of the essence, while extensive refers to the all-pervasiveness of the function.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a07_11', 'ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a08_12']	故智分因果，即佛華嚴，佛是果智，華即因故。🔽疏「先以二門各自圓融」者，初融文殊信解智三；	故智分因果，即佛華嚴，佛是果智，華即因故。 疏「先以二門各自圓融」者，初融文殊信解智三；	085	Therefore, wisdom is divided into cause and effect, which is the Buddha's Flower Ornament. The Buddha is the effect of wisdom, while the flower is the cause.🔽The commentary states First, the two gates are each perfectly harmonious. The first harmonizes Mañjuśrī's faith, understanding, and wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a09_11']	後「依體起行」下，融普賢所信及行并所證三。	後「依體起行」下，融普賢所信及行并所證三。	085	The second, below Relying on the essence to give rise to practice, harmonizes Samantabhadra's faith, practice, and realization.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a10_8']	疏「是以文殊三事」下，總結上三。	疏「是以文殊三事」下，總結上三。	085	The commentary states Therefore, Mañjuśrī's three matters and below summarizes the above three.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a10_18', 'ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a11_8']	雖開兩段，義有三重：🔽一二聖三事各自圓融；	雖開兩段，義有三重： 一二聖三事各自圓融；	085	Although divided into two sections, the meaning has three layers:🔽1. The three matters of the two sages are each perfectly interfused;
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a11_18']	二二聖三事各對圓融；	二二聖三事各對圓融；	085	2. The three matters of the two sages each correspond to perfect interfusion;
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a13_13']	三總融二聖，謂初三事既自圓融，次以三事各對圓融，故其六法但成一味。	三總融二聖，謂初三事既自圓融，次以三事各對圓融，故其六法但成一味。	085	3. The two sages are completely fused, meaning that since the first three matters are perfectly interfused, the next three matters each correspond to perfect interfusion, thus their six principles only form a single flavor.
['ZH_T36_1736_085:0663a14_17']	而言「文殊三事融通隱隱」者，信智圓融，不壞相故。	而言「文殊三事融通隱隱」者，信智圓融，不壞相故。	085	As for saying Mañjuśrī's three matters are subtly interfused, it is because faith and wisdom are perfectly interfused without losing their characteristics.
