Having done so, he again gives rise to a lower mind and is reborn in the desire realm, closely attending and making offerings to the buddhas, giving rise to boundless factors of enlightenment, not realizing the ultimate truth until he is fully mature.

In this way, bodhisattvas, through skillful means, cultivate the perfection of meditative concentration, yet are unable to realize the reality-limit, and also do not manifest entry into the cessation of feelings and discriminations, and until the requisites for enlightenment are complete, they take on a body in the desire realm and cultivate bodhisattva practices.
