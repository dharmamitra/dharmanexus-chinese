['ZH_T37_1764_003:0679c19_5']	辨義汎有兩門：	辨義汎有兩門：	003	There are generally two approaches to discerning the meaning:
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0679c20_12']	一就攝義從詮門中辨得多少、二就捨詮證實門中明得多少。	一就攝義從詮門中辨得多少、二就捨詮證實門中明得多少。	003	One is to discern the amount obtained from the perspective of subsuming the meaning and interpreting it; the other is to clarify the amount obtained from the perspective of abandoning interpretation and realizing reality.
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0679c21_3']	從詮門中分別有四：	從詮門中分別有四：	003	There are four distinctions from the perspective of interpretation:
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0679c26_2']	一約一詮始終別論，初得多義、後時得少，從詮之義具顯文中，初得聞持成就之處依文具解，故初得多，後設重思委審而已，無多異見故後得少，故此經中初依之人得八分義，第二依人更得四分，乃至第四但得兩分；	一約一詮始終別論，初得多義、後時得少，從詮之義具顯文中，初得聞持成就之處依文具解，故初得多，後設重思委審而已，無多異見故後得少，故此經中初依之人得八分義，第二依人更得四分，乃至第四但得兩分；	003	First, discussing the beginning and end of a single interpretation separately, one obtains much meaning in the beginning and little at a later time. From the perspective of the meaning of interpretation, the text clearly shows that one initially attains the accomplishment of hearing and upholding, and completely understands the text based on the text, so one obtains much in the beginning. Later, even if one thinks deeply and examines carefully, there are not many different views, so one obtains little later. Therefore, in this sutra, the person who relies on the initial obtains the meaning of eight parts, the person who relies on the second obtains four more parts, and so on, up to the fourth who only obtains two parts;
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0679c28_4']	二約一詮以終攝始，初時得少、後時得多，故此經中初依但得八分之義，乃至第四得十六分；	二約一詮以終攝始，初時得少、後時得多，故此經中初依但得八分之義，乃至第四得十六分；	003	Second, in terms of a single teaching, the beginning is included in the end. Initially, one obtains little, but later, one obtains much. Therefore, in this sutra, initially, one only obtains the meaning of the eight parts, and by the fourth, one obtains the sixteen parts.
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0680a01_16']	三約多詮始終別論，初得義少聞教少故、終得義多聞教多故，故第十地能受諸佛雲雨說法，依其所聞亦知多義；	三約多詮始終別論，初得義少聞教少故、終得義多聞教多故，故第十地能受諸佛雲雨說法，依其所聞亦知多義；	003	Third, in terms of many teachings, the beginning and end are discussed separately. Initially, one obtains little meaning because one hears little teaching, but in the end, one obtains much meaning because one hears much teaching. Therefore, in the tenth ground, one is able to receive the Dharma teachings spoken by the buddhas like clouds and rain, and based on what one hears, one also knows much meaning.

Initially, one obtains little because one's mind is mostly focused on the teaching and one's understanding of the principle is obscure. In the end, one obtains much because one is able to abandon the teaching and one's understanding of the principle becomes clear.
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0680a06_9']	二以終攝始，初少後多，理在可知。	二以終攝始，初少後多，理在可知。	003	Second, the beginning is included in the end. Initially, there is little, but later, there is much. The principle is understandable.

['ZH_T37_1764_003:0685b16_14']	三明向前所即人法有其可依、不可依義，如來常住是故可依，有為無常故不可依。	三明向前所即人法有其可依、不可依義，如來常住是故可依，有為無常故不可依。	003	The third clarifies the meaning of what can and cannot be relied upon in terms of people and dharmas mentioned earlier. Since the Tathāgata is permanent, he can be relied upon. Since conditioned [dharmas] are impermanent, they cannot be relied upon.
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0685b20_10']	第四簡偽異真之中，「若人破戒」明其無行，「為利養故說佛無常」明其無解，「如是之人不應依止，此義決了故名定義」，此明向前所依人者依於如來，不依如是破戒之人。	第四簡偽異真之中，「若人破戒」明其無行，「為利養故說佛無常」明其無解，「如是之人不應依止，此義決了故名定義」，此明向前所依人者依於如來，不依如是破戒之人。	003	In the fourth section distinguishing the false from the true, If a person breaks the precepts clarifies their lack of practice. For the sake of offerings, they say the Buddha is impermanent clarifies their lack of understanding. Such a person should not be relied upon. This meaning is definitive, therefore it is called definitive meaning. This clarifies that the person who is relied upon earlier relies on the Tathāgata, not on such a precept-breaking person.

['ZH_T37_1764_003:0694c04_13']	第二句中，佛為「明醫」，深閑治法名「知方藥」，知苦由於迷理而生，故言「知瘡因珠入體」，佛性雖隱，在於現在淺近身中，名「珠入皮」，現有不滅故曰「停住」。	第二句中，佛為「明醫」，深閑治法名「知方藥」，知苦由於迷理而生，故言「知瘡因珠入體」，佛性雖隱，在於現在淺近身中，名「珠入皮」，現有不滅故曰「停住」。	003	In the second sentence, the Buddha is the clear physician, well-versed in the methods of treatment is called knowing the prescriptions and medicines, knowing that suffering arises from delusion of principle, therefore it is said knowing the cause of the wound is the pearl entering the body, although the Buddha-nature is hidden, it is in the present shallow body, called the pearl entering the skin, presently existing and not extinguished is called abiding.

When the true self is concealed, they falsely conceive of existence where there is no existence. The Buddha now uses the absence to make them know the non-existence, and causes them to arouse the intention to seek in the place of existence. Therefore, he now asks, Where is it now?
['ZH_T37_1764_003:0694c11_19']	第四句中，明諸凡夫被聖徵窮方覺無我，乍見無我翻違舊意，故云「驚答我額上珠乃無去耶」。	第四句中，明諸凡夫被聖徵窮方覺無我，乍見無我翻違舊意，故云「驚答我額上珠乃無去耶」。	003	In the fourth sentence, it clarifies that when ordinary beings are thoroughly investigated by the sages, they only then realize there is no self.

The Tathāgata reveals their nature to comfort their minds, calling it comforting the warrior. Since those with the nature will certainly attain it, he encourages them, saying, You should not be sorrowful. When you were fighting, the treasure pearl entered your body clarifies the reason for its concealment. Because the nature is concealed within the body due to the conditions of delusion, it is called the pearl entering the body.
