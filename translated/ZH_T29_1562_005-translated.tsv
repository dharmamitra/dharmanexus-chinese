['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b21_4']	5 五辯本事品第一之五又上座言：	5 五辯本事品第一之五又上座言：	Chapter 1, section 5 on the five kinds of eloquence, the first part on the main points. The elder says:
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b21_18']	火界或少或不增強，即名為冷。	火界或少或不增強，即名為冷。	The fire element, whether small or not increasing in strength, is called cold.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b22_3']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b22_16']	於彼無日或去日遠便有冷故。	於彼無日或去日遠便有冷故。	Because when there is no sun or it is far from the sun, there is cold.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b24_5']	又如極大炎熱起時，無別少分所造觸起，同許唯有火大增多；	又如極大炎熱起時，無別少分所造觸起，同許唯有火大增多；	Moreover, when extremely great heat arises, it is not admitted that there is the arising of a separate small part of derivative contact, but only that the fire element increases greatly;
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b25_13']	熱減少時亦應如是，無別少分所造觸生，應許唯是火大減少。	熱減少時亦應如是，無別少分所造觸生，應許唯是火大減少。	when heat decreases, it should be the same. It should be admitted that there is the arising of a separate small part of derivative contact, but it should be admitted that only the fire element decreases.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b27_14']	若別有冷，亦應許有別所造觸非煖非冷，是故定無冷所造觸非火界少或不增強即名為冷。	若別有冷，亦應許有別所造觸非煖非冷，是故定無冷所造觸非火界少或不增強即名為冷。	If there is a separate cold, it should also be admitted that there is a separate derivative contact that is neither hot nor cold. Therefore, there is definitely no derivative contact of cold. The fire element, whether small or not increasing in strength, is called cold.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354b28_14']	現見冷觸所損害者，火界增時能攝益故。	現見冷觸所損害者，火界增時能攝益故。	It is seen that when the fire element increases in one who is harmed by cold contact, it can benefit.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c01_3']	損害因增轉應損害，誰有智者作如是執，被少火害歸投大火？	損害因增轉應損害，誰有智者作如是執，被少火害歸投大火？	Who with intelligence would hold that one who is harmed by a small fire should be thrown into a great fire?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c02_11']	若謂彼由匱乏火故有損害者，理必不然，定有餘因能損害故。	若謂彼由匱乏火故有損害者，理必不然，定有餘因能損害故。	If you say that he is harmed because of a lack of fire, this is not reasonable, because there must be another cause of harm.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c03_10']	謂火少故有餘冷增能為損害，非即由火。	謂火少故有餘冷增能為損害，非即由火。	That is, because of the small amount of fire, the other cold increases and can harm him, not the fire itself.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c05_7']	由此准說冷攝益者謂為少因，所攝益者此因若增轉應攝益，是故彼論非為應理。	由此准說冷攝益者謂為少因，所攝益者此因若增轉應攝益，是故彼論非為應理。	On the basis of this, we conclude that when cold benefits, it is a small cause, and when the benefited person is benefited, if this cause increases, it should benefit. Therefore the treatise is not reasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c07_10']	又彼所說，熱增減時無所造生唯即火者，亦不應理，現見二法更互相違，一法增時餘法減故。	又彼所說，熱增減時無所造生唯即火者，亦不應理，現見二法更互相違，一法增時餘法減故。	Also, what they say, that when heat increases or decreases, there is no derivative form produced, and it is only fire, is also unreasonable, because we see that two dharmas that are mutually contradictory may increase or decrease.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c08_17']	如能斷道與所斷惑，非道增時無別惑起，例道退位無別惑生。	如能斷道與所斷惑，非道增時無別惑起，例道退位無別惑生。	For example, when the path of insight that eliminates the passions increases, no other passions are produced. In the same way, when the path of cultivation that eliminates the passions increases, no other passions are produced.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c10_15']	又冷生時和合異故，謂水風界增盛聚中有冷生因非由火界，不應就火增盛為難。	又冷生時和合異故，謂水風界增盛聚中有冷生因非由火界，不應就火增盛為難。	Also, when cold is born, it is born from the combination of the other elements, i.e., water and wind, and not from fire. Therefore, it is not proper to raise the question of the increase of fire.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c12_4']	又執火界少為冷者，彼雪聚中火微極少，不應於此冷微極多。	又執火界少為冷者，彼雪聚中火微極少，不應於此冷微極多。	Also, if you maintain that a small amount of fire is cold, then in a mass of snow the fire element is extremely small and should be colder than cold.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c12_17']	智不應言如如火界漸漸微少。	智不應言如如火界漸漸微少。	You should not say that as the fire element gradually diminishes,
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c13_12']	如是如是火界轉多，為應理論。	如是如是火界轉多，為應理論。	so does the fire element increase. This is the correct theory.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c14_11']	彼執冷火無別體故，不可金少即為非金。	彼執冷火無別體故，不可金少即為非金。	They maintain that cold is not a separate substance from fire, and that when there is little fire it is not fire.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c15_19']	故有別物異諸大種，由火界減彼物體增，是所造觸說名為冷。	故有別物異諸大種，由火界減彼物體增，是所造觸說名為冷。	Therefore there is a separate substance that is different from the four great elements. When the fire element diminishes, the substance increases, and the derivative touch is called cold.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c17_17']	有執此宗，謂有大種增生冷觸，冷觸即是此大種者，理亦不然，冷與水風相各異故。	有執此宗，謂有大種增生冷觸，冷觸即是此大種者，理亦不然，冷與水風相各異故。	There is another interpretation of this theory, namely, that the cold touch is produced by the increase of the great elements, and that the cold touch is the great elements themselves. This is also unreasonable, because cold is different from the characteristics of water and wind.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c19_5']	又二物成，體應是假，便應不為身識所緣，以非冷煖無別性故。	又二物成，體應是假，便應不為身識所緣，以非冷煖無別性故。	Also, if it were composed of two substances, its substance would be a nominal one, and it would not be the object of the body consciousness, because there is no separate nature apart from cold and heat.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c20_9']	例無別冷，理亦不然，彼即冷等下等品類，分位別故。	例無別冷，理亦不然，彼即冷等下等品類，分位別故。	The example of the absence of a separate cold is not the same as this, because cold, etc., are the lower categories of heat, etc., and differ in their states.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c20_14']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	Other masters say,
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c21_3']	冷等唯用煖無為體。	冷等唯用煖無為體。	that cold, etc., only use heat, etc., as their substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c22_6']	此亦不然，品類異故，猶如煖等不容無法有異品類。	此亦不然，品類異故，猶如煖等不容無法有異品類。	This is also not so, because their categories are different, just as heat, etc., do not allow the existence of a category of nonexisting things.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c24_4']	或應地等用無為性，謂亦可說唯水等無名地等界，故彼所說非破冷觸是造色因。	或應地等用無為性，謂亦可說唯水等無名地等界，故彼所說非破冷觸是造色因。	Or, earth, etc., would use nonexisting natures, because one can also say that the only water, etc., that exist are called the realms of earth, etc. Therefore what they say is not a reason for the nonexistence of cold as a derivative form.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c26_2']	又冷能為覺生緣故，如火界等非即煖無，應有色聚全無有火，有非有俱不應理故。	又冷能為覺生緣故，如火界等非即煖無，應有色聚全無有火，有非有俱不應理故。	Also, because cold can be a condition for the generation of sensation, just as the realm of fire, etc., are not just heat, there would be no fire at all in a mass of form, and it is not reasonable to say that it both exists and does not exist.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c27_10']	諸色聚中既必有火，是則冷觸應畢竟無，故知離火別有冷觸。	諸色聚中既必有火，是則冷觸應畢竟無，故知離火別有冷觸。	Since there must be fire in all masses of form, then cold sensation would be absolutely nonexistent. Therefore we know that apart from fire there is a separate cold sensation.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c28_14']	又諸冷觸其體實有，相狀分明，現可覺故，猶如煖等。	又諸冷觸其體實有，相狀分明，現可覺故，猶如煖等。	Moreover, cold touch really exists, its characteristics are distinct, and it can be directly perceived, just like heat and so forth.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0354c29_12']	又契經中如煖說故體必應有，故契經言：	又契經中如煖說故體必應有，故契經言：	Moreover, because it is mentioned in the scriptures like heat, its substance must exist. A scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a02_10']	我於冷煖皆能堪忍，若於爾時冷煖調適，即能成熟取證成就，非於爾時極冷極煖。	我於冷煖皆能堪忍，若於爾時冷煖調適，即能成熟取證成就，非於爾時極冷極煖。	I can endure both cold and heat. If at that time cold and heat are moderate, then one can mature, attain, and accomplish. At that time, it is neither extremely cold nor extremely hot.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a03_8']	若極冷煖不能修業，故冷造色實有義成。	若極冷煖不能修業，故冷造色實有義成。	If it is extremely cold or hot, one cannot cultivate. Therefore, the existence of cold derivative form is established.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a03_13']	又上座言：	又上座言：	Moreover, the elder says:
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a04_8']	飢、渴二種非所造色，希求性故。	飢、渴二種非所造色，希求性故。	Hunger and thirst are not derivative form because they are the nature of desire.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a05_2']	理亦不然，此二於因說果名故。	理亦不然，此二於因說果名故。	This is also unreasonable, because these two are called effects in terms of their causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a06_7']	由觸差別逼切其身，生食飲欲，是飢渴因，故名飢渴。	由觸差別逼切其身，生食飲欲，是飢渴因，故名飢渴。	Due to the difference in contact that oppresses the body, the desire for food and drink arises. This is the cause of hunger and thirst, and therefore it is called hunger and thirst.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a07_5']	如說輕安，謂身輕性，輕安果故說名輕安。	如說輕安，謂身輕性，輕安果故說名輕安。	It is like speaking of serenity, which is the lightness of the body, because it is the effect of serenity, it is called serenity.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a08_12']	若爾，此因應煖為性，由火界煖能熟能消便能發生食飲欲故。	若爾，此因應煖為性，由火界煖能熟能消便能發生食飲欲故。	If this is so, then the cause of desire should be heat, because the heat of the fire element can cook and digest food and drink, and thus generates the desire for food and drink.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a09_12']	此言非理，食飲二欲應是造色，火為因故。	此言非理，食飲二欲應是造色，火為因故。	This argument is unreasonable, because the two desires for food and drink should be derivative form, because fire is their cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a10_11']	又非火界是二欲因，應一切時生一欲故。	又非火界是二欲因，應一切時生一欲故。	Moreover, the fire element is not the cause of the two desires, because it should generate desire at all times.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a12_8']	現見二欲非恒時有，豈不自宗欲因造觸所依大種雖恒非無，而此造觸體非常有？	現見二欲非恒時有，豈不自宗欲因造觸所依大種雖恒非無，而此造觸體非常有？	It is seen that the two desires do not exist at all times. How is it that the cause of desire is the great elements that support the derivative form of touch, which, although always existing, are not nonexistent, but the substance of the derivative form of touch is not always present?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a13_7']	此例不然，欲因造觸待風火界增強生故。	此例不然，欲因造觸待風火界增強生故。	This example is not appropriate, because the cause of desire, the derivative form of touch, must wait for the increase of the wind and fire elements in order to be born.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a14_15']	若謂二欲亦應爾者，理亦不然，如前已說二欲應是造色性故。	若謂二欲亦應爾者，理亦不然，如前已說二欲應是造色性故。	If you say that the two desires are also like this, this is not reasonable, because, as stated previously, the two desires should be by nature derivative form.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a16_4']	若謂如因所觸大種發生身識，而非身識是造色性，欲亦應然。	若謂如因所觸大種發生身識，而非身識是造色性，欲亦應然。	If you say that just as the great elements that are touched generate the body consciousness, and yet the body consciousness is not by nature derivative form, so also is desire,🔽this is not so.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a18_2']	此不相似，識不要因大種增盛方得生起，欲即不然，因增生故由彼身識不因大種。	此不相似，識不要因大種增盛方得生起，欲即不然，因增生故由彼身識不因大種。	This is not similar, because consciousness does not necessarily arise due to the increase of the great elements. Desire is not so, because it arises due to increase. Therefore, the body consciousness is not caused by the great elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a19_1']	或等或增差別生起，但隨所依不由差別。	或等或增差別生起，但隨所依不由差別。	Or it arises with equality or increase, but only according to the support, not due to distinction.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a19_20']	身觸為緣而得生起，二欲不然，如所造色？	身觸為緣而得生起，二欲不然，如所造色？	It arises due to the body and touch as conditions, but the two desires are not so, like derivative form.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a20_8']	要因大種增盛而生。	要因大種增盛而生。	It must arise due to the increase of the great elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a21_7']	既隨大種差別而生，何緣所遮令非造色？	既隨大種差別而生，何緣所遮令非造色？	Since it arises according to the distinction of the great elements, why is it prevented from being derivative form?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a23_5']	風火若盛二欲便增，風火若微二欲便減，既隨大種增微不同，二欲何緣非造色性？	風火若盛二欲便增，風火若微二欲便減，既隨大種增微不同，二欲何緣非造色性？	If wind and fire increase, the two desires increase. If wind and fire diminish, the two desires diminish. Since they do not equally increase or diminish according to the great elements, why are the two desires not the nature of derivative form?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a25_3']	若言二欲雖因大種而不依彼，故非造色，謂欲依心不依大種，故不應難令成造色。	若言二欲雖因大種而不依彼，故非造色，謂欲依心不依大種，故不應難令成造色。	If it is said that although the two desires are caused by the great elements, they do not rely on them, so they are not derivative form, and that desire relies on the mind but not on the great elements, so it should not be argued that they become derivative form.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a26_2']	若爾，此欲應不要因大種增盛方得生起。	若爾，此欲應不要因大種增盛方得生起。	If so, then these desires should not necessarily arise due to the increase of the great elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a27_1']	不見不依大種身識，隨諸大種差別而生；	不見不依大種身識，隨諸大種差別而生；	We do not see that the body consciousness does not depend on the great elements, but arises according to the differences in the great elements.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a27_19']	唯見身識大種為緣，若等若增但觸便起。	唯見身識大種為緣，若等若增但觸便起。	We only see that the body consciousness takes the great elements as its condition, and when they are equal or increased, only the tactile object arises.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355a29_15']	二欲若爾，應一切時不待增盛有因便起，則前所說應一切時生二欲難堅住難遣。	二欲若爾，應一切時不待增盛有因便起，則前所說應一切時生二欲難堅住難遣。	If this is so, then the two desires should always arise without waiting for the increase of their causes, and the previously stated difficulty that the two desires are difficult to maintain and difficult to eliminate should always arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b02_5']	又風火界有時雖增，而不現起食飲二欲，故知二欲因現不生。	又風火界有時雖增，而不現起食飲二欲，故知二欲因現不生。	Moreover, even when the wind and fire elements sometimes increase, the two desires for food and drink do not arise. Therefore we know that the two desires do not arise due to the present [elements].
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b02_14']	彼因爾時何緣不起？	彼因爾時何緣不起？	What is the reason that their causes do not arise at that time?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b03_13']	由所依身有過患故，或為餘緣所障礙故。	由所依身有過患故，或為餘緣所障礙故。	Because the supported body has a fault, or because it is obstructed by other conditions.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b04_16']	豈不即由此故二欲不生，何須復別計有欲因造觸？	豈不即由此故二欲不生，何須復別計有欲因造觸？	Isn't it precisely because of this that the two desires do not arise? What need is there to further imagine that there is a cause for desire that produces the tactile object?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b06_6']	此不應然，欲與身識俱時起故，雖有障礙而識得生、欲不得生。	此不應然，欲與身識俱時起故，雖有障礙而識得生、欲不得生。	This is not so, because desire arises simultaneously with body consciousness. Even though there is obstruction, consciousness can arise while desire cannot arise.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b06_11']	此有何理？	此有何理？	What is the principle here?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b07_8']	心所法生必定繫屬依緣識合彼三具有。	心所法生必定繫屬依緣識合彼三具有。	The arising of mental factors is definitely dependent on support, object, and the combination of consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b08_7']	又彼希求大法地攝，故與一切心品俱生。	又彼希求大法地攝，故與一切心品俱生。	Moreover, it seeks the stage of great dharmas, and therefore arises together with all mental states.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b09_10']	生欲勝因爾時具有而不生者，必為所餘生緣𨵗故。	生欲勝因爾時具有而不生者，必為所餘生緣𨵗故。	The dominant conditions for the arising of desire exist at that time, but if it does not arise, it is definitely hindered by other conditions for arising.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b10_1']	所餘緣者，謂所造觸。	所餘緣者，謂所造觸。	The other conditions are the derivative form called touch.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b10_15']	故離大種實有飢渴，造色為性。	故離大種實有飢渴，造色為性。	Therefore, apart from the great elements, there is a real hunger and thirst, which have derivative form as their nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b12_6']	又不應言造觸生障即障心心所，勿心等生障即障造觸，無異因故。	又不應言造觸生障即障心心所，勿心等生障即障造觸，無異因故。	Moreover, one should not say that the obstruction to the arising of derivative form is the same as the obstruction to mind and mental factors, lest the obstruction to the arising of mind, etc. be the same as the obstruction to the arising of derivative form, because there is no different cause.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b13_4']	且止廣諍，必應信有飢渴二體造觸為性。	且止廣諍，必應信有飢渴二體造觸為性。	Let us stop this extensive dispute for now. One must believe that hunger and thirst have derivative form as their nature.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b13_9']	今應思擇：	今應思擇：	Now we should consider:
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b14_4']	若諸大種色聚中增，為體、為用？	若諸大種色聚中增，為體、為用？	If the great elements increase in a mass of form, is it in substance or in function?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b14_13']	何緣復勸如是思擇？	何緣復勸如是思擇？	What is the reason for further encouraging such consideration?
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b15_2']	為欲蠲除不實過故。	為欲蠲除不實過故。	In order to remove unreal faults.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b15_11']	經主自論有處說言：	經主自論有處說言：	The author of the treatise says in some places:
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b16_1']	此是彼宗所有過失。	此是彼宗所有過失。	This is a fault belonging to their school.
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b16_10']	彼宗謂彼毘婆沙師。	彼宗謂彼毘婆沙師。	The Vaibhāṣikas.🔽🔽
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b17_18']	言諸聚中一切大種，體雖等有而或有聚、作用偏增，如心心所。	言諸聚中一切大種，體雖等有而或有聚、作用偏增，如心心所。	The Vaibhāṣikas say that in all aggregates, although the great elements exist equally, sometimes the function of one element predominates in a certain aggregate, just as the mind and mental factors [exist equally in the mind],
['ZH_T29_1562_005:0355b18_7']	又如所覺團中鹽味。	又如所覺團中鹽味。	and just as the taste of salt is perceived in a ball [of dough].
