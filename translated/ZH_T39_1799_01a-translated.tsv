['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c07_19']	一總、二別。	一總、二別。	First, the general purpose; second, the specific purposes.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c08_12']	總者，謂詶因酬請，顯理度生。	總者，謂詶因酬請，顯理度生。	The general purpose is to respond to causes and requests, manifest the truth, and liberate beings.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c09_1']	一代教興皆由此矣。	一代教興皆由此矣。	The rise of the teachings of the entire lifetime [of the Buddha] is all for this reason.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c10_8']	若原佛本意，唯為一大事因緣，欲令眾生開示悟入佛之知見。	若原佛本意，唯為一大事因緣，欲令眾生開示悟入佛之知見。	If we trace back the Buddha's original intention, it is solely for the great matter of the causes and conditions of the one great matter, wishing to enable beings to open, reveal, realize, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and insight.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c11_10']	雖三車通許，唯賜白牛，但為一乘，無三及二也。	雖三車通許，唯賜白牛，但為一乘，無三及二也。	Although the three vehicles are generally allowed, only the white ox cart is given; it is solely for the one vehicle, without the three or the two.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c11_20']	別者有十，故說此經：	別者有十，故說此經：	There are ten specific purposes for expounding this sūtra:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c12_9']	一、為克示真三昧故。	一、為克示真三昧故。	First, in order to decisively demonstrate the true samādhi.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c16_1']	謂阿難遭難，蓋無真定，故請諸佛得成菩提妙奢摩他、三摩、禪那最初方便，及佛告許，云有三摩提，名大佛頂首楞嚴王，具足萬行，十方如來一門超出妙莊嚴路。	謂阿難遭難，蓋無真定，故請諸佛得成菩提妙奢摩他、三摩、禪那最初方便，及佛告許，云有三摩提，名大佛頂首楞嚴王，具足萬行，十方如來一門超出妙莊嚴路。	This refers to Ānanda's encounter with difficulties, which is due to lacking true concentration. Therefore, he requests the marvelous śamatha, samāpatti, and dhyāna that the buddhas have attained to accomplish enlightenment, as well as the initial skillful means. The Buddha then tells him that there is a samādhi called the great buddha-peak śūraṃgama king, which is replete with myriad practices and is the marvelous adornment path through which the tathāgatas of the ten directions all emerge.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c17_14']	至於再請責己，將謂惠我，偈讚希有等，乃至如來諷歎，名金剛王如幻三昧。	至於再請責己，將謂惠我，偈讚希有等，乃至如來諷歎，名金剛王如幻三昧。	As for the second request and blaming oneself, it is as if you think you are bestowing grace on me. The praise of the verses is rare, and so on, up to the Tathāgata's chanting and praise, called the vajra-king like-illusion samādhi.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c18_13']	勅說圓通，文殊揀顯，指三世佛同此一門。	勅說圓通，文殊揀顯，指三世佛同此一門。	He ordered the explanation of the perfect penetration, and Mañjuśrī selected and revealed, pointing out that the buddhas of the three times are the same in this one approach.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c20_3']	道場加行，成就聖位，立此經名，破滅七趣、辨識諸魔，皆為此也。	道場加行，成就聖位，立此經名，破滅七趣、辨識諸魔，皆為此也。	The preparatory practices of the ritual arena, the accomplishment of the holy stages, establishing the name of this sūtra, destroying the seven destinies, and discerning the various demons, are all for this.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c20_13']	二、為廣破諸妄執故。	二、為廣破諸妄執故。	Second, it is for the sake of extensively refuting various false attachments.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c21_8']	謂阿難執妄迷真，匿王執常為斷。	謂阿難執妄迷真，匿王執常為斷。	Namely, Ānanda clings to delusion and is confused about the truth, while King Prasenajit clings to permanence as annihilation.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c21_18']	七處徵詰，三疑拒諍。	七處徵詰，三疑拒諍。	He is questioned in seven places and resists with three doubts.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c22_2']	佛再語云：	佛再語云：	The Buddha again says:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c22_15']	若汝執悋分別覺觀為汝心等。	若汝執悋分別覺觀為汝心等。	If you insistently cling to discriminating thoughts as your mind, and so on.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c23_17']	故約心見二門隨執廣破，此之執相不離人法也。	故約心見二門隨執廣破，此之執相不離人法也。	Therefore, he refutes in detail according to the two approaches of mind and seeing. These characteristics of clinging are not apart from person and dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c24_7']	三、為開顯妙明心故。	三、為開顯妙明心故。	Third, it is for the sake of revealing the wondrously bright mind.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c25_17']	謂阿難初請三昧，佛先審問發心，既陳愛見之源，全迷真實之體。	謂阿難初請三昧，佛先審問發心，既陳愛見之源，全迷真實之體。	That is to say, when Ānanda first requested the samādhi, the Buddha first examined his motivation for developing the mind of enlightenment. Having revealed the source of his love and views, he was completely confused about the essence of reality.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c25_20']	遂云：	遂云：	Consequently, he said:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c26_17']	眾生無始生死相續，皆由不知常住真心。	眾生無始生死相續，皆由不知常住真心。	Sentient beings, since beginningless time, have continued in birth and death, all due to not knowing the eternally abiding true mind.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0823c27_14']	此真妙明，即是菩提涅槃元清淨體。	此真妙明，即是菩提涅槃元清淨體。	This true wondrous and bright mind is precisely the originally pure essence of bodhi and nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a01_17']	故阿難自責不知寂常，如來許可發妙明性，先就心見二門乍徵乍顯，後約三科七大分明顯會，令於法法咸見性常，俱遍俱融，含攝無礙。	故阿難自責不知寂常，如來許可發妙明性，先就心見二門乍徵乍顯，後約三科七大分明顯會，令於法法咸見性常，俱遍俱融，含攝無礙。	Therefore, Ānanda reproached himself for not knowing the eternally quiescent, and the Tathāgata approved his development of the wondrous and bright nature of mind. First, he used the two approaches of mind and seeing to alternately investigate and reveal, and later he used the three categories and seven divisions to clearly reveal and explain, causing him to see the eternally abiding nature in every dharma, all-pervading, all-inclusive, and unobstructed.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a04_10']	眾皆領悟，自知心遍十方，諸所有物皆即菩提妙體，元明心遍含裹十虛，身土虛空了無所得，唯一本妙常住不滅。	眾皆領悟，自知心遍十方，諸所有物皆即菩提妙體，元明心遍含裹十虛，身土虛空了無所得，唯一本妙常住不滅。	The assembly all understood and realized for themselves that their minds pervade the ten directions, that all existing things are precisely the wondrous essence of bodhi, that the originally bright mind pervades and contains the ten directions, and that the body, land, and space are utterly unattainable, with only the originally wondrous, eternally abiding, and indestructible remaining.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a05_16']	洎滿慈疑於有相，慶喜再責因緣，佛隨開示，令得知見矣。	洎滿慈疑於有相，慶喜再責因緣，佛隨開示，令得知見矣。	When Manjushri had doubts about form, Ananda again questioned about causes and conditions. The Buddha followed and revealed, enabling them to know and see.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a06_5']	四、為決斷眾疑網故。	四、為決斷眾疑網故。	Fourth, it is for the sake of decisively cutting through the web of doubts.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a09_6']	謂佛顯示真見，阿難隨見疑生，或縮斷、離身、因緣、自爾、和合、非合，執相疑性，諸大遍圓，滅妄生妄，成真不真，修無常因，獲常住果。	謂佛顯示真見，阿難隨見疑生，或縮斷、離身、因緣、自爾、和合、非合，執相疑性，諸大遍圓，滅妄生妄，成真不真，修無常因，獲常住果。	This refers to the Buddha revealing true seeing, while Ananda, following his seeing, gave rise to doubts, either shrinking, separating from the body, causes and conditions, naturally, combining, or not combining, grasping at characteristics and doubting the nature, the all-pervasiveness and perfection of the great elements, extinguishing delusion and giving rise to delusion, accomplishing the true and the not true, cultivating impermanent causes, and attaining the fruition of abiding permanence.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a09_17']	疑網既眾，佛隨斷之矣。	疑網既眾，佛隨斷之矣。	Since doubts are numerous, the Buddha followed and cut them off.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a10_6']	五、為辨析修行門故。	五、為辨析修行門故。	Fifth, it is for the sake of discerning the approach to practice.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a12_9']	謂佛廣示藏體，慶喜深解，現前舉喻，天王賜與華屋，雖知所賜，將入無門，已悉多聞，不逮修習。	謂佛廣示藏體，慶喜深解，現前舉喻，天王賜與華屋，雖知所賜，將入無門，已悉多聞，不逮修習。	This refers to the Buddha extensively revealing the essence of the treasury, while Ananda deeply understood. He used a metaphor to illustrate, like a heavenly king bestowing a magnificent mansion. Although he knew what was bestowed, he had no way to enter. He had already understood much learning, but did not reach practice and cultivation.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a12_14']	故請問云：	故請問云：	Therefore, he asked:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a13_8']	從何攝伏疇昔攀緣，入佛知見？	從何攝伏疇昔攀緣，入佛知見？	From what should one subdue past clinging and enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision?
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a14_12']	佛舉二義決定，以為發覺初心，謂止及觀，斯為要也。	佛舉二義決定，以為發覺初心，謂止及觀，斯為要也。	The Buddha raised two definitive meanings as the initial arousal of the mind, namely calming and contemplation, which are essential.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a15_14']	初令以湛旋妄成不生滅，次令審詳煩惱知根降伏。	初令以湛旋妄成不生滅，次令審詳煩惱知根降伏。	First, it is instructed to use stillness to turn away from delusion and achieve non-arising and non-ceasing. Next, it is instructed to carefully examine the roots of afflictions and subdue them.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a16_14']	一根既反，餘根自旋，諸妄銷亡，不真何待？	一根既反，餘根自旋，諸妄銷亡，不真何待？	Once one root is reversed, the other roots will naturally turn, and all delusions will disappear. What need is there to wait for non-true?
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a17_3']	六、為分別邪正行故。	六、為分別邪正行故。	Sixth, it is for the sake of distinguishing between correct and deviant practices.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a18_18']	謂阿難已悟修行，後代罔知邪正，雖期正道，多陷邪宗，水灌漏巵，若為取滿？	謂阿難已悟修行，後代罔知邪正，雖期正道，多陷邪宗，水灌漏巵，若為取滿？	It means that Ānanda has already realized cultivation, but later generations do not know what is correct and what is deviant. Although they aspire to the correct path, they often fall into deviant teachings. If water is poured into a leaky jar, how can it be filled?
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a19_2']	慶喜請云：	慶喜請云：	Ānanda asked:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a20_8']	眾生去佛漸遠，邪師說法至多，欲令心入佛乘，遠魔無退。	眾生去佛漸遠，邪師說法至多，欲令心入佛乘，遠魔無退。	As sentient beings become increasingly distant from the Buddha, there are many deviant teachers expounding the Dharma. I wish to lead their minds into the Buddha's vehicle, to avoid demons and prevent backsliding.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a21_9']	佛舉四種明誨，諸聖同途，戒根不虧，定慧可據。	佛舉四種明誨，諸聖同途，戒根不虧，定慧可據。	The Buddha raised four kinds of clear instructions, the sages all follow the same path. If the precepts are not violated, concentration and wisdom can be relied upon.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a22_20']	如其不切清禁、禪慧洪深，鬼屬魔民斯難逭免，祈進却步，誠可悲夫。	如其不切清禁、禪慧洪深，鬼屬魔民斯難逭免，祈進却步，誠可悲夫。	If one does not strictly observe the precepts and the vast and profound meditation and wisdom, it will be difficult for the ghosts and demons to escape. It is truly lamentable to pray for progress but take a step back.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a23_9']	七、為顯呪功能勝故。	七、為顯呪功能勝故。	Seventh, it is in order to demonstrate the superior function of the mantra.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a24_4']	謂慶喜難在登伽，如來遣呪往救。	謂慶喜難在登伽，如來遣呪往救。	It means that Ānanda's difficulty lies in Dengjia, and the Tathāgata sends the mantra to rescue him.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a24_14']	承力雖至，密言闕聞。	承力雖至，密言闕聞。	Although the power is received, the secret words are not heard.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a26_2']	況能潛護根門、防閑宿習，齋戒不稟而自備、果證不遠而可得。	況能潛護根門、防閑宿習，齋戒不稟而自備、果證不遠而可得。	Moreover, how can it secretly protect the sense-gates and prevent the habitual tendencies from arising? The precepts and observances are not received but are naturally observed, and the fruition and realization are not far away but can be attained.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a27_6']	消難獲利，自行化他，因人果人靡不由此而辨其事也。	消難獲利，自行化他，因人果人靡不由此而辨其事也。	Eliminating difficulties and gaining benefits, practicing for oneself and transforming others, whether one is an ordinary person or a sage, all rely on this to discern their affairs.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a27_16']	八、為證入有階降故。	八、為證入有階降故。	Eighth, it is in order to prove that there are levels of entry.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824a29_12']	謂理絕修證、事存階漸，偏一則病空有、圓通則融真俗，故不損寂滅而建立諸位。	謂理絕修證、事存階漸，偏一則病空有、圓通則融真俗，故不損寂滅而建立諸位。	It means that principle transcends cultivation and realization, but phenomena exist in stages. If biased or one-sided, then there is the illness of emptiness and existence. If perfectly penetrating, then true and false are merged. Therefore, without damaging quiescence and extinction, the various stages are established.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b02_17']	阿難知機為請，如來就行開示，始從漸次、終乎極果，於無生忍中立五十七位，不斷而斷，惑障必亡；	阿難知機為請，如來就行開示，始從漸次、終乎極果，於無生忍中立五十七位，不斷而斷，惑障必亡；	Ānanda knew the opportunity and made the request. The Tathāgata explained according to the practice, starting from the gradual stages and ending with the ultimate fruit. Within the acceptance of non-arising, fifty-seven stages were established, cutting off without cutting off, with afflictive hindrances necessarily gone;
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b03_7']	非證而證，神用斯備。	非證而證，神用斯備。	not realizing yet realizing, with spiritual functions complete.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b03_17']	豈同魔外都無位次耶？	豈同魔外都無位次耶？	How could it be the same as the demons and outsiders who have no stages at all?
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b03_20']	文云：	文云：	The text says:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b06_3']	是種種地，皆以金剛觀察如幻十種深喻，奢摩他中用諸如來毘婆舍那清淨修證，漸次深入耳。	是種種地，皆以金剛觀察如幻十種深喻，奢摩他中用諸如來毘婆舍那清淨修證，漸次深入耳。	These various stages are all with the vajra observation of the ten profound analogies such as illusion, using the śamatha of the tathāgatas' vipaśyanā for pure cultivation and realization, gradually entering deeply.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b06_13']	九、為廣示諸魔境故。	九、為廣示諸魔境故。	9. In order to extensively reveal the various demonic realms.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b08_12']	謂修禪觀人靡不有初，而鮮克有終者，蓋不諳其魔境，妄生取著，不了唯心，遂派諸道。	謂修禪觀人靡不有初，而鮮克有終者，蓋不諳其魔境，妄生取著，不了唯心，遂派諸道。	It is said that there is no one who does not begin the practice of meditation, but few are able to complete it. This is because they are not familiar with the demonic realms and mistakenly give rise to attachments, not understanding that they are only mind, and thus they branch off into various paths.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b09_1']	佛慈無緣，不問自說。	佛慈無緣，不問自說。	The Buddha's compassionate, impartial mind speaks of this without being asked.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b10_8']	觀中破陰，每陰十種，五十境界分析邪源，末代修禪免為所惑。	觀中破陰，每陰十種，五十境界分析邪源，末代修禪免為所惑。	In the contemplation, each of the five aggregates is destroyed in ten ways, with fifty realms analyzing the source of delusion. Practitioners in the latter age of the Dharma can avoid being confused by this.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b10_18']	十、為究盡妄想源故。	十、為究盡妄想源故。	Ten, in order to thoroughly investigate the source of delusion.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b11_13']	謂五陰諸經皆說，未聞五妄想成。	謂五陰諸經皆說，未聞五妄想成。	It is said in the scriptures on the five aggregates, but I have not heard of the five delusions being formed.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b13_18']	今明破一陰時出一妄想，破則從麁至細、起則自細現麁，其之根源唯一識陰，識陰無體，但是圓常。	今明破一陰時出一妄想，破則從麁至細、起則自細現麁，其之根源唯一識陰，識陰無體，但是圓常。	Now it is explained that when one aggregate is destroyed, one delusion is eliminated. When destroyed, it goes from coarse to subtle; when arising, it appears from subtle to coarse. Its root source is only the aggregate of consciousness. The aggregate of consciousness has no substance, but is only the perfect and eternal.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b14_1']	文云：	文云：	The text says:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b14_11']	湛入合湛，歸識邊際。	湛入合湛，歸識邊際。	The clear and still mind enters into the clear and still, returning to the limit of consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b15_8']	既知五陰咸是妄想，五陰攝法何所不該？	既知五陰咸是妄想，五陰攝法何所不該？	Since it is known that the five aggregates are all delusions, what is not included in the five aggregates?
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b15_11']	論云：	論云：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b17_1']	一切諸法唯依妄念而有差別，若離心念，則無一切境界之相也。	一切諸法唯依妄念而有差別，若離心念，則無一切境界之相也。	All dharmas only rely on deluded thoughts to have distinctions. If one leaves mental thoughts, there are no characteristics of any external realm.
['ZH_T39_1799_01a:0824b17_10']	由斯十意而說此經。	由斯十意而說此經。	For these ten reasons, this sutra is expounded.
