['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a09_7']	先釋會名者，他化天會，約處為名，謂他化作樂具，自得受用，顯非己力，表入地所證真如非由緣造故名也。	先釋會名者，他化天會，約處為名，謂他化作樂具，自得受用，顯非己力，表入地所證真如非由緣造故名也。	First, explaining the name of the assembly, the assembly of the Heaven of Others' Transformations, is named based on the place, referring to others transforming and creating enjoyable implements, which one obtains and uses oneself, manifesting not by one's own power, illustrating that the realized thusness upon entering the grounds is not created by conditions, thus it is named.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a10_1']	二品名者，此品名有四種：	二品名者，此品名有四種：	Second, the names of the chapters, this chapter has four kinds of names:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a13_4']	一別譯本名漸備一切智德經、二下文名集一切智智法門品，此二就功能立名，謂十地因行能集生一切佛智德，然十德漸增故云漸備。	一別譯本名漸備一切智德經、二下文名集一切智智法門品，此二就功能立名，謂十地因行能集生一切佛智德，然十德漸增故云漸備。	First, the name of the separately translated version, the Sutra of Gradually Completing All Wisdom Virtues, second, the name in the text below, the chapter on the Dharma Door of Gathering All Wisdom, these two are named based on function, referring to the ten grounds' causal practices being able to gather and produce all buddhas' wisdom virtues, yet the ten virtues gradually increase, thus it is said gradually complete.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a16_3']	三更別譯一本名十住經、四此中名十地，此二約義帶數受稱，謂十是一周圓數、地是就義約喻為名，謂生成佛智住持故也。	三更別譯一本名十住經、四此中名十地，此二約義帶數受稱，謂十是一周圓數、地是就義約喻為名，謂生成佛智住持故也。	The third is a different translation with one version named the Sutra on the Ten Abodes, and the fourth is named the Ten Grounds here. These two are named according to their meaning and number, referring to ten as a complete number, and ground as a name based on meaning and metaphor, referring to generating, nurturing, and upholding the Buddha's wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a16_16']	餘釋總別名等，下本分中辨。	餘釋總別名等，下本分中辨。	The other explanations of the general and specific names will be discussed below in the chapter on the fundamental part.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a17_4']	二來意中亦二：	二來意中亦二：	The second is the reason for the chapter, which is also twofold:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a18_14']	先會來意者，前是阿含行滿，次明入證成果，義次第故，是故來也。	先會來意者，前是阿含行滿，次明入證成果，義次第故，是故來也。	First, the reason for the assembly is that the previous chapter concludes the fulfillment of the teachings and practices, and the next chapter discusses entering the realization and attaining the fruition. The meaning is in sequential order, and therefore it comes.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a20_3']	二品來者，前明迴比向證，今明迴已得證顯行不虛，故次來也。	二品來者，前明迴比向證，今明迴已得證顯行不虛，故次來也。	Second, the reason for the chapter is that the previous chapter discusses turning from analogy towards realization, and now the chapter discusses the realization attained after turning, revealing that the practice is not in vain, and therefore it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a22_2']	又前約比位寄顯普賢圓滿行德，今約證位寄顯三乘差別行德，顯法次第，故次來也。	又前約比位寄顯普賢圓滿行德，今約證位寄顯三乘差別行德，顯法次第，故次來也。	Moreover, the previous chapter discusses the perfect virtues of Samantabhadra from the perspective of analogy, and now the chapter discusses the differentiated virtues of the Three Vehicles from the perspective of realization. Revealing the sequential order of the Dharma, therefore it comes next.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a23_16']	是故前諸位內皆悉廣顯普賢自在之德，於此地上絕無其名者，是此事也。	是故前諸位內皆悉廣顯普賢自在之德，於此地上絕無其名者，是此事也。	Therefore, in the previous stages, the virtues of Samantabhadra's mastery are all extensively revealed. On this ground, there is no mention of them at all. This is the fact.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a24_8']	豈可地前深廣證地反劣？	豈可地前深廣證地反劣？	How could it be that the realization of the stages before the grounds is profound and vast, while the realization of the grounds is inferior?
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a24_17']	但是寄顯不同故也。	但是寄顯不同故也。	It is just that the different manifestations are shown.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a24_19']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a26_7']	宜應證地是深順同普德，地前位淺應順三乘，何不爾耶？	宜應證地是深順同普德，地前位淺應順三乘，何不爾耶？	It should be that the realization of the grounds is profound and accords with the virtues of Samantabhadra, while the stages before the grounds are shallow and should accord with the Three Vehicles. Why is it not so?
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a26_9', 'ZH_T35_1733_009:0277a28_4']	答：🔽此中文意為顯教相不同故爾，謂若於地上得普賢德，則與三乘教便不別。	答： 此中文意為顯教相不同故爾，謂若於地上得普賢德，則與三乘教便不別。	Answer:🔽The meaning of this text is to show that the different manifestations of the teachings are like this. That is to say, if one attains the virtues of Samantabhadra on the grounds, then the teaching of the Three Vehicles is not different.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b01_9']	今明若是三乘行位，則於地前實不自在，顯此一乘則不如是，故於彼地前則便自在得普賢德。	今明若是三乘行位，則於地前實不自在，顯此一乘則不如是，故於彼地前則便自在得普賢德。	Now, if it is the practice and stages of the Three Vehicles, then it is indeed not free before the grounds. This One Vehicle is not like this, and therefore it is free on those grounds before the grounds and attains the virtues of Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b03_14']	是故若准此普賢地前而取地上，其地上行相甚深甚深，非如此說，此即下〈普賢行品〉是也。	是故若准此普賢地前而取地上，其地上行相甚深甚深，非如此說，此即下〈普賢行品〉是也。	Therefore, if we follow this stage of Samantabhadra before the grounds to take the characteristics of practice on the grounds, the characteristics of practice on the grounds are extremely profound and profound, not like this explanation, which is the chapter on the practice of Samantabhadra below.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b06_2']	若准此三乘證地行相而取地前，其地前行甚極麁淺，不同前說，即是《瑜伽．菩薩地》內十二住中初二是也。	若准此三乘證地行相而取地前，其地前行甚極麁淺，不同前說，即是《瑜伽．菩薩地》內十二住中初二是也。	If we follow the characteristics of practice on the grounds of the three vehicles to take the practices before the grounds, the practices before the grounds are extremely coarse and shallow, not the same as the previous explanation, which is the first two of the twelve abodes in the Bodhisattva Grounds of the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b06_4']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b06_9']	何故不齊？	何故不齊？	Why is it not the same?
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b07_18']	謂一乘地前有普賢德，一乘地上亦有普賢行，如〈普賢行品〉說。	謂一乘地前有普賢德，一乘地上亦有普賢行，如〈普賢行品〉說。	That is to say, the stage before the grounds of the One Vehicle has the virtues of Samantabhadra, and the stage above the grounds of the One Vehicle also has the practices of Samantabhadra, as explained in the chapter on the practice of Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b09_1']	三乘地上德如此品說，三乘地前行文中何不說？	三乘地上德如此品說，三乘地前行文中何不說？	The virtues above the grounds of the three vehicles are explained in this chapter. Why is the practice before the grounds of the three vehicles not explained in the text?
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b09_3']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b10_6']	此經宗明一乘故，是故一乘行廣，論三乘位略辨也。	此經宗明一乘故，是故一乘行廣，論三乘位略辨也。	Because this sūtra mainly clarifies the One Vehicle, therefore the practices of the One Vehicle are extensive, and the stages of the three vehicles are briefly discussed.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b10_9']	又釋：	又釋：	Another explanation:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b12_15']	以一乘十地甚深，故通攝三乘等總為十地，仍以六相陀羅尼門融顯無盡，成普賢十地自在之義。	以一乘十地甚深，故通攝三乘等總為十地，仍以六相陀羅尼門融顯無盡，成普賢十地自在之義。	Because the one vehicle's ten grounds are profound, it comprehensively includes the three vehicles and so forth as the ten grounds, still using the dhāraṇī gate of the six characteristics to fuse and reveal the inexhaustible, accomplishing the meaning of Samantabhadra's mastery of the ten grounds.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b14_1']	地前則未能如是，但直顯普賢，故不同地上也。	地前則未能如是，但直顯普賢，故不同地上也。	Those below the grounds are still unable to do so, but only directly reveal Samantabhadra, thus they are not the same as those on the grounds.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b14_9']	三宗趣者，亦二：	三宗趣者，亦二：	Third, the purport and objective: There are also two parts.

['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b18_1']	約法有生了因果及差別平等二種因果，亦是修生本有因果，亦有教事及義理。	約法有生了因果及差別平等二種因果，亦是修生本有因果，亦有教事及義理。	In terms of dharmas, there are the causes and effects of birth and understanding, as well as the two kinds of causes and effects of differentiation and equality, which are also the causes and effects of cultivation origination and inherent existence, and there are also the teachings, events, and principles.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b19_2']	體相用準前可知，但通性起為異，餘義準知。	體相用準前可知，但通性起為異，餘義準知。	The essence, characteristics, and function can be known according to the previous, but they are common to nature origination, which is different. The other meanings can be known by analogy.

['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b28_5']	慧行中四五六是二乘慧，七地已去是菩薩慧。	慧行中四五六是二乘慧，七地已去是菩薩慧。	within the practice of wisdom, the practices of the fifth, sixth, and seventh grounds are the wisdom of the two vehicles, while the practices of the seventh ground and above are the wisdom of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277b29_9']	七約位有二位，謂證位、阿含位，是十地之位故也。	七約位有二位，謂證位、阿含位，是十地之位故也。	Seventh, in terms of stages, there are two stages, namely, the stage of realization and the stage of the scriptures, because this is the stage of the ten grounds.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0277c03_8']	八約寄乘法，謂初二三地寄世間人天乘，四五六七地寄出世間是三乘，八地已上出出世間是一乘法，故以諸乘為此地法也。	八約寄乘法，謂初二三地寄世間人天乘，四五六七地寄出世間是三乘，八地已上出出世間是一乘法，故以諸乘為此地法也。	Eighth, in terms of the vehicles of the Dharma, the first two and three grounds correspond to the worldly human and heavenly vehicles, the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh grounds correspond to the supramundane three vehicles, and the eighth ground and above correspond to the vehicle of the One Vehicle that is beyond the mundane and supramundane.

Now that Vairocana has attained perfect enlightenment, his original vow has been fulfilled, so the Buddha who empowers him is also named Vajra. Therefore, it is said to be the same name.

['ZH_T35_1733_009:0282c20_11']	三修成相對，一切地中聞思修報生識智，此等四心緣照之解名曰阿含、真智出言以之為證，故下論言聞思修等是則可說，以可說故名曰阿含，地智離文名之為證。	三修成相對，一切地中聞思修報生識智，此等四心緣照之解名曰阿含、真智出言以之為證，故下論言聞思修等是則可說，以可說故名曰阿含，地智離文名之為證。	Third, in terms of cultivation and accomplishment, the four kinds of minds of hearing, contemplation, cultivation, and retribution-born cognition and wisdom in all the grounds, which are the understanding of illuminating through conditions, are called the canon, and true wisdom that transcends words is called the evidence. Therefore, the treatise below says that hearing, contemplation, cultivation, etc. can be spoken of, and because they can be spoken of, they are called the canon. The wisdom of the grounds transcends words and is called the evidence.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0282c23_10']	四真偽相對，一切地中真偽合修名曰阿含、捨偽契真名之為證，猶下所明義說二大，說大阿含方便修、義大是證行成也。	四真偽相對，一切地中真偽合修名曰阿含、捨偽契真名之為證，猶下所明義說二大，說大阿含方便修、義大是證行成也。	Fourth, true and false are contrasted: in all stages, true and false are cultivated together, which is called the canon; abandoning the false and conforming to the true is called realization. It is like the two greatnesses explained below, where the canon is the cultivation of expedient means, and the greatness of meaning is the accomplishment of realized practice.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0282c26_6']	五相實相對，世間修中得彼證相名曰阿含、契本實相名之為證，猶下所說增上妙法光明法門，增上是證、光明是教。	五相實相對，世間修中得彼證相名曰阿含、契本實相名之為證，猶下所說增上妙法光明法門，增上是證、光明是教。	Fifth, characteristics and reality are contrasted: in worldly cultivation, attaining the realized characteristics is called the canon; conforming to the fundamental reality is called realization. It is like the supreme wonderful Dharma light Dharma door explained below, where the supreme is realization and the light is the teaching.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0282c27_15']	六體德相對，就彼離相所成行中，無始法性本隱今顯，名之為證。	六體德相對，就彼離相所成行中，無始法性本隱今顯，名之為證。	Sixth, essence and virtue are contrasted: within the practice accomplished through the characteristics of detachment, the originally hidden Dharma nature that is now revealed is called realization.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0282c29_19']	依本所成方便行德，依教修生名為阿含，猶下文中練金所況，金體喻證、釧等嚴具喻於阿含。	依本所成方便行德，依教修生名為阿含，猶下文中練金所況，金體喻證、釧等嚴具喻於阿含。	The virtues of expedient practices accomplished based on the essence are called the canon, which are cultivated and produced based on the teachings. It is like the analogy of refining gold in the text below, where the essence of gold is like realization, and the bracelets and other ornaments are like the canon.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a04_7']	七體用相對，前體及德相從為證、依此所起隨順世間教智之用名為阿含，猶下文中珠放光等所況法是，珠輪等淨喻於證體、光炎等喻於阿含。	七體用相對，前體及德相從為證、依此所起隨順世間教智之用名為阿含，猶下文中珠放光等所況法是，珠輪等淨喻於證體、光炎等喻於阿含。	Seventh, the contrast between essence and function. The previous essence and characteristics are taken as the evidence. The function of teaching wisdom that accords with the world arising from this is called the canon, just like the dharmas illustrated by the light emitted by the jewel, etc., in the following text. The purity of the jewel wheel, etc. is a metaphor for the essence of the evidence, while the light, flames, etc. are metaphors for the canon.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a08_2']	八自分勝進相對，自分所成體德及用皆名為證、能受佛教稱曰阿含，猶下文中歎金剛藏二力是也，妙智及辨名為證力、於佛教法念堅淨慧名阿含力。	八自分勝進相對，自分所成體德及用皆名為證、能受佛教稱曰阿含，猶下文中歎金剛藏二力是也，妙智及辨名為證力、於佛教法念堅淨慧名阿含力。	Eighth, the contrast between one's own and others' advancement. The essence, characteristics, and function accomplished by oneself are all called evidence. The ability to receive the Buddha's teachings is called the canon, just like the praise of Vajragarbha's two powers in the following text. Wonderful wisdom and eloquence are called the power of evidence, while the firm wisdom of mindfulness of the Buddha's teachings is called the power of the canon.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a11_14']	九約詮就實相對，真智之體說以為證、即此證體約言分十名為阿含，猶下文中虛空跡處所況法是，虛空平等喻地證智，故下論云「字身住處證智所攝」；	九約詮就實相對，真智之體說以為證、即此證體約言分十名為阿含，猶下文中虛空跡處所況法是，虛空平等喻地證智，故下論云「字身住處證智所攝」；	Ninth, the contrast between the provisional and the real. The essence of true wisdom is said to be evidence. This essence of evidence is divided into ten based on words and is called the canon, just like the dharmas illustrated by the place of the trace of space in the following text. The equality of space is a metaphor for the wisdom of the evidence of the stage, thus the following treatise says: The abode of the body of letters is subsumed by the wisdom of evidence.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a13_9']	空中之跡喻地阿含，故下論云「非無地智名句字身，名句字身是阿含法」也。	空中之跡喻地阿含，故下論云「非無地智名句字身，名句字身是阿含法」也。	The traces in the sky are likened to the teachings on the ground, thus the treatise below says, The wisdom that is not without the ground is called the body of phrases and letters. The body of phrases and letters is the Dharma of the teachings.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a14_3']	此之九種通上及下，應准知之。	此之九種通上及下，應准知之。	These nine kinds are common to both above and below, and one should understand them accordingly.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a15_14']	此中別辨十句始終中，初三地前思修利物、次一見道、餘六修道。	此中別辨十句始終中，初三地前思修利物、次一見道、餘六修道。	Among the ten phrases that are specifically distinguished here, the first three are the benefits of contemplating and cultivating for the sake of beings before the grounds, the next one is the path of seeing, and the remaining six are the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a16_17']	此十始終狹於前入，以彼入中前該聞慧、後攝佛盡。	此十始終狹於前入，以彼入中前該聞慧、後攝佛盡。	These ten are narrower than the previous entry in terms of beginning and end, because the previous entry includes the wisdom of hearing in the beginning and encompasses the Buddha in the end.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a18_12']	此不同者，理實齊通，但以聞慧及佛非是正地，前已明故，不重辨也。	此不同者，理實齊通，但以聞慧及佛非是正地，前已明故，不重辨也。	The reason why this is different is that in principle they are equally comprehensive, but because the wisdom of hearing and the Buddha are not the correct grounds, they are not discussed again because they have already been clarified.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a19_16']	一攝始終，謂稱思宣法故云實說，實說成德故名為攝。	一攝始終，謂稱思宣法故云實說，實說成德故名為攝。	The first is the beginning and end of inclusion, which means that because it is called contemplating and proclaiming the Dharma, it is called true speaking. True speaking achieves virtue, so it is called inclusion.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a20_17']	以彼聞慧從他受法，師義不便，故不論也。	以彼聞慧從他受法，師義不便，故不論也。	Because that wisdom of hearing receives the Dharma from others, it is not convenient for the meaning of the teacher, so it is not discussed.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a23_10']	二欲始終，是思慧，上品增上求心名之為欲，菩薩教化欲令眾生契合諸地，故云令證一切佛法，此是安住義也。	二欲始終，是思慧，上品增上求心名之為欲，菩薩教化欲令眾生契合諸地，故云令證一切佛法，此是安住義也。	Second, the beginning and end of desire is thinking wisdom. The superior and supreme mind of seeking is called desire. Bodhisattvas teach and transform, desiring to cause sentient beings to accord with the various grounds. Therefore, it is said to cause them to realize all Buddha Dharmas. This is the meaning of abiding.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a24_1']	念是其欲，隨順是令證。	念是其欲，隨順是令證。	Recollection is desire, and following is causing realization.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a26_6']	三行始終，即修慧，於此加行位中正觀意言唯識等觀名之為行，以非證位，是故名為觀分時中。	三行始終，即修慧，於此加行位中正觀意言唯識等觀名之為行，以非證位，是故名為觀分時中。	Third, the beginning and end of practice is cultivation wisdom. Within this stage of added effort, the correct contemplation of mental verbalization and consciousness-only contemplation is called practice, because it is not the stage of realization, therefore it is called the stage of contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a28_5']	於彼地上真無流法作帶相觀，是故於彼無流道品但能修相觀，未得無相觀也。	於彼地上真無流法作帶相觀，是故於彼無流道品但能修相觀，未得無相觀也。	On those grounds, the true uncontaminated dharmas are contemplated with characteristics. Therefore, in those uncontaminated paths one is only able to cultivate the contemplation of characteristics, and has not yet attained the contemplation without characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283a29_3']	復依相觀，說授前機，名為分別。	復依相觀，說授前機，名為分別。	Moreover, based on the contemplation with characteristics, it is said to bestow the teachings to those with potential, which is called discrimination.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b01_16']	《攝論》現前立少物，謂是唯識性等，《唯識論》帶相觀心等，並此位行也。	《攝論》現前立少物，謂是唯識性等，《唯識論》帶相觀心等，並此位行也。	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says, Manifesting a small object, namely the nature of consciousness-only, etc., and the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi says, The mind contemplating with characteristics, etc., are all the practices of this stage.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b02_16']	是意言觀故，經中名說、論經名觀，其義一也。	是意言觀故，經中名說、論經名觀，其義一也。	Because this is the contemplation of mental words, the sūtra calls it speaking, and the treatise calls it contemplation, the meaning is the same.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b03_6']	四證始終，即見道位。	四證始終，即見道位。	Fourth, the beginning and end of realization is the stage of the path of seeing.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b04_4']	大智光明是根本智，善分別者是後得智。	大智光明是根本智，善分別者是後得智。	Great wisdom light is fundamental wisdom, and good discernment is subsequently attained wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b04_14']	以自嚴者，二智成德。	以自嚴者，二智成德。	Adorning oneself means the two wisdoms accomplish virtue.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b05_14']	又論經擇字是此分別，分別中勝，名善分別。	又論經擇字是此分別，分別中勝，名善分別。	Moreover, the treatise takes the word choice as this discernment, and the superior discernment among discernments is called good discernment.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b06_6']	勝者，法無我故，過小名大。	勝者，法無我故，過小名大。	Superior means surpassing the selflessness of dharmas, and surpassing the lesser is called great.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b06_11']	治惑曰明。	治惑曰明。	Curing afflictions is called light.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b06_15']	此事中。	此事中。	In this matter.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b07_17']	彼時中皆善知者，釋方便字，是相見道故有此知。	彼時中皆善知者，釋方便字，是相見道故有此知。	Good knowledge of that time explains the word skillful. Because it is the path of seeing, there is this knowledge.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b08_7']	論既不顯，今作三釋：	論既不顯，今作三釋：	Since the treatise does not make it clear, I now make three explanations:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b09_2']	一此事中者，是此見道事中也。	一此事中者，是此見道事中也。	First, in this matter refers to the matter of this path of seeing.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b09_16']	彼時中者，是地前觀分時中也。	彼時中者，是地前觀分時中也。	In that time refers to the time of contemplating before the grounds.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b11_5']	正照於此兼巧知彼，名皆善知以為方便，方便猶是以自嚴義。	正照於此兼巧知彼，名皆善知以為方便，方便猶是以自嚴義。	Correctly illuminating this and also skillfully knowing that, it is called all well-known as a skillful means. Skillful means is still the meaning of adorning oneself.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b13_2']	二釋此事同前，彼時是後修道位中所有行相，以此後智照前達後名皆善知。	二釋此事同前，彼時是後修道位中所有行相，以此後智照前達後名皆善知。	Second explanation: This matter is the same as before. At that time, it is the aspects of practice in the stage of subsequent cultivation. Using this subsequent wisdom to illuminate the past and penetrate the future is called all well-known.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b15_10']	三此事中者是此後智相見道中，彼時中者是彼本智真見道時中，皆善知者巧具二智用以自嚴名為方便。	三此事中者是此後智相見道中，彼時中者是彼本智真見道時中，皆善知者巧具二智用以自嚴名為方便。	Third explanation: In this matter refers to the subsequent wisdom of the path of seeing aspects. At that time refers to the time of the fundamental wisdom of the path of seeing truth. All well-known means skillfully possessing the function of the two wisdoms and using it to adorn oneself, which is called skillful means.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b15_13']	又釋：	又釋：	Another explanation:
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b16_11']	以法真見道兼知彼故，云皆善知也。	以法真見道兼知彼故，云皆善知也。	Because the wisdom of seeing the truth of dharmas also knows that, it is said all well-known.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b17_7']	五修道始終，謂出世智辨其智體。	五修道始終，謂出世智辨其智體。	Fifth, the beginning and end of the path of cultivation. The wisdom that distinguishes the essence of wisdom is supramundane wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b17_16']	智力明有入法功能。	智力明有入法功能。	The power of wisdom illuminates the ability to enter the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b18_2']	法是行法。	法是行法。	Dharma refers to the practice of the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b20_1']	義是義理，是智所入，謂此法義能出生具智名具智門，修道智力能入彼門故云也。	義是義理，是智所入，謂此法義能出生具智名具智門，修道智力能入彼門故云也。	Meaning refers to the principles of the Dharma. It is what the wisdom enters.

Because the power of wisdom on the path of cultivation can enter that door, it is said so.

Therefore, they are provisionally used to contrast and clarify the practices to be cultivated, which is the revealing explanation among the ten kinds of explanations.

['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b27_2']	已說正義，他言能壞，自行失也。	已說正義，他言能壞，自行失也。	The correct principle has been explained, but the words of others can destroy it, which is a loss in one's own practice.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283b27_17']	眷屬離散，化他行失，故成障也。	眷屬離散，化他行失，故成障也。	The dispersion of one's retinue is a loss in one's practice of transforming others, and thus becomes an obstacle.

['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283c07_3']	三於小起戀，失於二利，不妄大心故以成治。	三於小起戀，失於二利，不妄大心故以成治。	Third, giving rise to attachment to the small, losing the two benefits, not forgetting the great mind, therefore using it to accomplish the treatment.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283c08_12']	四於生怠化亦乖兩利，化物不疲故以成治，故云教化成就等。	四於生怠化亦乖兩利，化物不疲故以成治，故云教化成就等。	Fourth, being lazy in transforming also deviates from the two benefits, not being tired of transforming beings, therefore using it to accomplish the treatment, thus saying teaching and transforming are accomplished, etc.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283c10_11']	五於化不巧故無方便亦失二益，以五明等一切處法明達巧慧名決定智為能治也。	五於化不巧故無方便亦失二益，以五明等一切處法明達巧慧名決定智為能治也。	Fifth, not being skillful in transforming, therefore lacking skillful means, also losing the two benefits, using the five sciences and all other places to illuminate the skillful wisdom of clear understanding, calling it the wisdom of certainty as the treatment.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0283c14_15']	又此五障中，初一不能破他邪宗、二雖能破他而不能立自己正宗、三雖能立破而情樂小乘、四雖不樂小乘而嬾化他、五雖化不疲而無化他方便，是故至五化行略周。	又此五障中，初一不能破他邪宗、二雖能破他而不能立自己正宗、三雖能立破而情樂小乘、四雖不樂小乘而嬾化他、五雖化不疲而無化他方便，是故至五化行略周。	Moreover, among these five hindrances, the first one cannot destroy the wrong doctrines of others, the second one can destroy others' doctrines but cannot establish one's own correct doctrines, the third one can establish and destroy but delights in the Lesser Vehicle, the fourth one does not delight in the Lesser Vehicle but is lazy in transforming others, and the fifth one, although transforming without fatigue, lacks skillful means in transforming others. Therefore, by the fifth, the practice of transformation is roughly complete.

The inspiration of one person is not as good as that of many people, so the second is to clarify the request of the great assembly. The request of those of the same kind is still gradual, so the third is to clarify the request of the Buddha's empowerment.

['ZH_T35_1733_009:0291b19_19']	二如壁，是第二句，別辨畫處，明其不無，以空中畫處有相難明，故更轉喻壁上顯示，謂彼空中畫處不無，如壁上畫處相似。	二如壁，是第二句，別辨畫處，明其不無，以空中畫處有相難明，故更轉喻壁上顯示，謂彼空中畫處不無，如壁上畫處相似。	Second, like a wall is the second sentence, specifically distinguishing the place of painting, clarifying that it is not non-existent. Because the marks in the painted place in empty space are difficult to discern, it further turns to a metaphor displayed on a wall, meaning that the painted place in that empty space is not non-existent, similar to the painted place on a wall.
['ZH_T35_1733_009:0291b21_16']	三是中不住故不可見，是第三句，別明不有，以彼空畫不得停住，故不可見也。	三是中不住故不可見，是第三句，別明不有，以彼空畫不得停住，故不可見也。	Third, because it does not abide in this, it cannot be seen is the third sentence, specifically clarifying that it is not existent.
