['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a09_8']	太子五陰久修五分，雖未無漏得名法身。	太子五陰久修五分，雖未無漏得名法身。	003	The five aggregates of the crown prince have long cultivated the five parts. Although they have not yet attained the undefiled, they are called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a09_13']	在二德前。	在二德前。	003	It is before the two virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a10_3']	樹下真明方有般若。	樹下真明方有般若。	003	Only under the tree does one have prajñā.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a11_1']	三十四心者，十六心破見、十八心斷愛。	三十四心者，十六心破見、十八心斷愛。	003	The thirty-four minds refer to the sixteen minds that destroy views and the eighteen minds that sever desires.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a12_19']	若頓證羅漢及辟支佛，此之二人皆一時得三十四心，羅漢但斷正使、支佛分侵習氣。	若頓證羅漢及辟支佛，此之二人皆一時得三十四心，羅漢但斷正使、支佛分侵習氣。	003	If one suddenly realizes the state of an arhat or a pratyekabuddha, these two people both attain the thirty-four minds at the same time. The arhat only severs the afflictions, while the pratyekabuddha partially invades the habitual tendencies.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a14_7']	若樹王下，用三十四，頓斷正習一時俱盡，是故此心獨在菩薩。	若樹王下，用三十四，頓斷正習一時俱盡，是故此心獨在菩薩。	003	If one uses the thirty-four minds under the tree of enlightenment to suddenly sever the afflictions and habitual tendencies and exhaust them all at once, then these minds are unique to the bodhisattva.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a14_17']	解脫在後，其相可見。	解脫在後，其相可見。	003	Liberation comes later, and its characteristics can be seen.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a15_17']	此之三法，以漏無漏存亡不同，故異而且縱。	此之三法，以漏無漏存亡不同，故異而且縱。	003	These three dharmas differ because of the difference between having outflows and being without outflows, and therefore they are different and yet sequential.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a17_19']	此教經部名為阿含，《釋論》明文以摩訶衍對三藏為小，《婆沙》翻數，此論廣說四階成佛。	此教經部名為阿含，《釋論》明文以摩訶衍對三藏為小，《婆沙》翻數，此論廣說四階成佛。	003	The scriptures of this teaching are called Āgamas. The Shi lun clearly states that the Mahāyāna is considered small in comparison to the Tripiṭaka. The *Pañcaviṃśati-sāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra translates as counting. This treatise extensively explains the four stages of becoming a buddha.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a18_18']	《阿含》唯經，《婆沙》唯論，三藏之名具經律論。	《阿含》唯經，《婆沙》唯論，三藏之名具經律論。	003	The Āgamas are only sūtras, the *Pañcaviṃśati-sāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra is only a treatise, and the name Tripiṭaka includes sūtras, vinaya, and śāstras.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a19_10']	此三所說但有三義，全無德義。	此三所說但有三義，全無德義。	003	What is taught in these three only has three meanings, and completely lacks the meaning of virtue.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a19_13']	何者？	何者？	003	What is that?
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a21_10']	終歸灰斷故無常德，非大涅槃故無樂德，無八自在故無我德，不斷五染故無淨德。	終歸灰斷故無常德，非大涅槃故無樂德，無八自在故無我德，不斷五染故無淨德。	003	Because in the end one returns to ashes and cessation, there is no virtue of permanence. Because it is not the great nirvāṇa, there is no virtue of bliss. Because there are no eight masteries, there is no virtue of self. Because the five defilements are not severed, there is no virtue of purity.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a21_15']	二、通教。	二、通教。	003	Second, the shared teaching.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a22_9']	通詮體觀，法本不生，非證後空。	通詮體觀，法本不生，非證後空。	003	It shares the interpretation of the essence and contemplation. The Dharma is originally unborn, not empty after realization.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a22_19']	此為法身，是故本有。	此為法身，是故本有。	003	This is the Dharma body, and therefore it originally exists.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a24_7']	境雖本有，須依此境，體破見思，正習盡處正是般若，故屬現有。	境雖本有，須依此境，體破見思，正習盡處正是般若，故屬現有。	003	Although the realm originally exists, it must rely on this realm to destroy the views and thoughts. The place where the correct and habitual [defilements] are exhausted is precisely prajñā, so it belongs to the present existence.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a25_2']	果縛盡時方是解脫，故屬當有。	果縛盡時方是解脫，故屬當有。	003	When the bondage of the fruit is exhausted, it is precisely liberation, so it belongs to the future existence.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a26_12']	此之三法，空境無知、般若有照，如幻色心盡方名脫，故云異而且縱。	此之三法，空境無知、般若有照，如幻色心盡方名脫，故云異而且縱。	003	These three dharmas, the empty realm without knowledge and prajñā with illumination, are called liberation only when the illusory form and mind are exhausted. Therefore, it is said to be different and yet sequential.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024a29_3']	前代成論師，見乾慧等十地中二乘證果，謂是小教所明人法俱空，乃取此義釋所弘之論，意謂小教探明大乘。	前代成論師，見乾慧等十地中二乘證果，謂是小教所明人法俱空，乃取此義釋所弘之論，意謂小教探明大乘。	003	The masters of the Satyasiddhi śāstra of previous generations, seeing the two vehicles attaining fruition in the ten grounds such as dry wisdom, considered it to be the emptiness of both person and dharmas explained in the lesser teaching, and thus took this meaning to explain the śāstra they propagated, thinking that the lesser teaching explores and clarifies the Mahāyāna.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b02_2']	故《妙玄》云「舊云《成論》探明大乘」，又云「成論師秖見共般若意，不見不共意」，即此義也。	故《妙玄》云「舊云《成論》探明大乘」，又云「成論師秖見共般若意，不見不共意」，即此義也。	003	Therefore, the Miaofa xianheng lun says, The old say that the Satyasiddhi śāstra explores and clarifies the Mahāyāna, and also says, The masters of the Satyasiddhi śāstra only see the meaning of the common prajñā, and do not see the meaning of the uncommon, which is precisely this meaning.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b04_1']	故知彼師不知藏實，是三藏空門與衍門永異，又不知衍門真諦含於但中及不但中。	故知彼師不知藏實，是三藏空門與衍門永異，又不知衍門真諦含於但中及不但中。	003	Therefore, we know that that teacher does not understand the true meaning of the canon, that the empty gate of the three canons is permanently different from the gate of the Mahayana, and that he does not understand that the truth of the Mahayana canon includes only the middle and not only the middle.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b04_16']	今就彼不知及鈍菩薩，故無四德。	今就彼不知及鈍菩薩，故無四德。	003	Now, based on what he does not understand and the dull bodhisattvas, there are no four virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b05_1']	三、別教。	三、別教。	003	Third, the separate teaching.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b06_9']	前破真諦乖圓別者，蓋違本經別分四德對於三身，故云乖別。	前破真諦乖圓別者，蓋違本經別分四德對於三身，故云乖別。	003	The previous refutation of the truth of the ultimate being contrary to the perfect and separate teachings is because it goes against the original sutra, which separately divides the four virtues and matches them with the three bodies, thus saying it is contrary to the separate teachings.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b07_17']	若以彼說四教收之，既談四德非前藏通，德既不融非後圓教。	若以彼說四教收之，既談四德非前藏通，德既不融非後圓教。	003	If we use his explanation of the four teachings to include it, since it discusses the four virtues, it is not the previous canon and shared teachings. Since the virtues are not fused, it is not the subsequent perfect teaching.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b08_17']	雖收屬別，然非別教通方之說，故云一途。	雖收屬別，然非別教通方之說，故云一途。	003	Although it is included in the separate teachings, it is not the teaching of the separate teachings that is universal, thus it is called one approach.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b08_19']	問：	問：	003	Question:
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b10_2']	真諦立云「般若、解脫各具二德」，今何斥云無德可稱？	真諦立云「般若、解脫各具二德」，今何斥云無德可稱？	003	Zhentian established that prajñā and liberation each have two virtues. Why is it now refuted by saying there are no virtues to be praised?
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b10_18']	答若就別論，二各具一，亦可名德。	答若就別論，二各具一，亦可名德。	003	Answer: If we discuss it separately, the two each have one, which can also be called virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b11_12']	今以圓斥，隨有所闕，德義不成。	今以圓斥，隨有所闕，德義不成。	003	Now, using the perfect to refute, following where there is a lack, the meaning of virtue is not established.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b11_15', 'ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b13_11']	何者？🔽若般若照境故常、破暗故淨，若無樂我，乃是有苦之常淨、不自在之常淨，豈成德耶？	何者？ 若般若照境故常、破暗故淨，若無樂我，乃是有苦之常淨、不自在之常淨，豈成德耶？	003	What are they?🔽If prajñā illuminates objects and is therefore constant, and destroys darkness and is therefore pure, if there is no bliss and self, then it is the constant purity of suffering, the constant purity of being unfree, how can it be a virtue?
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b15_8']	若解脫無暗故樂、廣遠故我，而無常淨，斯乃無常之樂我、垢染之樂我，豈成德耶？	若解脫無暗故樂、廣遠故我，而無常淨，斯乃無常之樂我、垢染之樂我，豈成德耶？	003	If liberation is without darkness and therefore blissful, and is vast and far-reaching and therefore self, but is not constant and pure, then it is the bliss and self of impermanence, the bliss and self of defilement, how can it be a virtue?
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b16_9']	既德有增減，則法不高廣，焉稱經王無量甚深耶？	既德有增減，則法不高廣，焉稱經王無量甚深耶？	003	Since the virtues have increase and decrease, then the Dharma is not lofty and vast, how can it be called the king of sūtras, immeasurable and profound?
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b16_14']	二、顯圓。	二、顯圓。	003	Second, revealing the perfect.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b16_19']	具如前說。	具如前說。	003	Fully as explained above.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b17_4']	三、勸生圓解。	三、勸生圓解。	003	Third, encouraging the arising of perfect understanding.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b17_14']	四德殘缺，非經之王。	四德殘缺，非經之王。	003	The four virtues are incomplete, not the king of sūtras.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b18_3']	縱橫可思，非佛所護。	縱橫可思，非佛所護。	003	The vertical and horizontal can be contemplated, not protected by the Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b19_2']	有念心眼皆是牛羊，無緣知見方可論道。	有念心眼皆是牛羊，無緣知見方可論道。	003	The mind and eyes with thoughts are all like cattle and sheep, only the unconditioned knowledge and vision can discuss the Way.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b19_8']	二、簡三寶。	二、簡三寶。	003	Second, distinguishing the Three Jewels.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b20_10']	相從者，從佛說法，從法有僧，從是三寶于今不絕。	相從者，從佛說法，從法有僧，從是三寶于今不絕。	003	Those who follow the Buddha's teachings, from the Dharma there is the Sangha, from this the Three Jewels continue to the present.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b21_4']	皆由歸佛、稟法成僧，故曰相從。	皆由歸佛、稟法成僧，故曰相從。	003	All of this is due to taking refuge in the Buddha, receiving the Dharma, and forming the Sangha, thus it is called following each other.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b21_19']	復名階梯者，蓋喻等級非相亂也。	復名階梯者，蓋喻等級非相亂也。	003	It is also called steps and ladders, which is a metaphor for the levels and ranks, not a disorder of characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b23_3']	此明別體四果之僧定不成佛，其猶下級不成上級。	此明別體四果之僧定不成佛，其猶下級不成上級。	003	This clarifies that the Sangha of the four fruits with separate natures definitely cannot become Buddhas, just as the lower levels cannot become the higher levels.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b25_15']	又樹王下迷真輕者，見如幻佛說無生法，三乘因地皆能斷結，有異三藏菩薩因中全不斷惑，眾即空故，名理和僧。	又樹王下迷真輕者，見如幻佛說無生法，三乘因地皆能斷結，有異三藏菩薩因中全不斷惑，眾即空故，名理和僧。	003	Moreover, those who are lightly deluded under the tree of enlightenment see the illusory Buddha expounding the Dharma of non-arising. The three vehicles on the ground of causes are all able to sever bonds, unlike the bodhisattvas of the three periods of the Tripiṭaka who completely do not sever delusions while in the cause stage, because the multitude is empty. It is called the Sangha of principle and harmony.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b26_19']	雖異三藏，而其三乘共證之理既是偏空，亦無四德。	雖異三藏，而其三乘共證之理既是偏空，亦無四德。	003	Although different from the Tripiṭaka, the principle of the three vehicles' common realization is still biased emptiness, and there are also no four virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024b29_13']	若華王世界成盧舍那，雖通圓別，今就鈍根迷中重者，不知即性，作修成解，是故佛寶從報彰名，法寶但名無量四諦。	若華王世界成盧舍那，雖通圓別，今就鈍根迷中重者，不知即性，作修成解，是故佛寶從報彰名，法寶但名無量四諦。	003	If in the world of the Flower King one becomes Vairocana, although it includes both the complete and the distinct, now for the sake of those with dull faculties who are heavily deluded, not knowing that it is the nature, they have the understanding that it is cultivated and accomplished. Therefore, the Buddha Jewel is named according to the reward, and the Dharma Jewel is only called the immeasurable four noble truths.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c01_7']	既非無作，故從多數受河沙名。	既非無作，故從多數受河沙名。	003	Since it is not the unconditioned, it receives the name of the sands of the Ganges according to the majority.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c02_16']	稟法之僧雖純菩薩，且非發心便成正覺，故四十一位分於賢聖。	稟法之僧雖純菩薩，且非發心便成正覺，故四十一位分於賢聖。	003	Although the monks who receive the Dharma are all pure bodhisattvas, they are not those who attain perfect enlightenment as soon as they generate the aspiration for enlightenment, so the forty-one stages are divided into sages and worthies.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c04_20']	此之三寶，佛是僧果、僧是佛因、法是因果，所修所證實僧成佛、佛現權僧，永異階梯，高下不改。	此之三寶，佛是僧果、僧是佛因、法是因果，所修所證實僧成佛、佛現權僧，永異階梯，高下不改。	003	As for these three treasures, the Buddha is the fruit of the Sangha, the Sangha is the cause of the Buddha, and the Dharma is the cause and effect. The truly accomplished Sangha becomes a Buddha, and the Buddha manifests as a provisional Sangha. They are forever different, and the high and low do not change.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c05_9']	然從別相，未是同體。	然從別相，未是同體。	003	However, from the separate characteristics, they are not yet of the same essence.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c05_19']	言同體者，三寶一體。	言同體者，三寶一體。	003	As for the same essence, the three treasures are of one essence.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c09_15']	此體覺了名佛、此體不覺名法、此體和合名僧，迷悟因果其體不分，一人一念無不具足，故《華嚴》三歸以體解大道為佛、深入經藏為法、統理大眾為僧，三雖在果而是一體。	此體覺了名佛、此體不覺名法、此體和合名僧，迷悟因果其體不分，一人一念無不具足，故《華嚴》三歸以體解大道為佛、深入經藏為法、統理大眾為僧，三雖在果而是一體。	003	This essence, when enlightened, is called the Buddha; this essence, when unenlightened, is called the Dharma; this essence, when harmoniously combined, is called the Sangha. Whether deluded or enlightened, the cause and effect do not divide the essence. Every person and every thought is fully endowed with it. Therefore, the three refuges of the Huayan [school] take understanding the great way as the Buddha, deeply entering the sutra canon as the Dharma, and governing the great assembly as the Sangha. Although the three are in the fruit, they are of one essence.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c11_1']	三寶若此，方與三德無二無別，是金光明所譬三寶也。	三寶若此，方與三德無二無別，是金光明所譬三寶也。	003	If the three treasures are like this, they are no different from the three virtues. This is the three treasures illustrated by the Golden Light.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c11_8']	三、簡三涅槃。	三、簡三涅槃。	003	Third, distinguishing the three nirvanas.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c12_6']	般涅槃那，翻為安樂，故凡聖大小皆有涅槃。	般涅槃那，翻為安樂，故凡聖大小皆有涅槃。	003	Nirvana is translated as peace and bliss, so all ordinary beings, sages, and the great and small vehicles all have nirvana.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c12_17']	若世人適意，亦是涅槃。	若世人適意，亦是涅槃。	003	If worldly people are satisfied, that is also nirvana.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c15_1']	若外道不知非想非非想定十種細想及無想天第六心心數法暫爾不行，故皆計為永寂涅槃。	若外道不知非想非非想定十種細想及無想天第六心心數法暫爾不行，故皆計為永寂涅槃。	003	If non-Buddhists do not know the ten kinds of subtle thoughts in the neither perception nor non-perception concentration and the sixth thought and thought concomitants of the non-perception heaven that temporarily do not operate, they all consider it to be eternal quiescent nirvana.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c15_13']	若染欲心伏，名方便涅槃。	若染欲心伏，名方便涅槃。	003	If the mind of defiled desire is subdued, it is called expedient nirvana.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c16_9']	若二乘菩薩論得未得，是三藏涅槃。	若二乘菩薩論得未得，是三藏涅槃。	003	If the two vehicles and bodhisattvas discuss whether they have attained or not, it is the nirvana of the Tripiṭaka teaching.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c17_18']	若三乘同盡子果兩縛，是通教但空共小涅槃，簡不但空不共二乘。	若三乘同盡子果兩縛，是通教但空共小涅槃，簡不但空不共二乘。	003	If the three vehicles together exhaust the two bonds of the child and fruit, it is the common nirvana of the Shared Teaching that is empty and shared with the small vehicle, distinguishing the not only empty that is not shared with the two vehicles.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c18_9']	今就共論，故無四德。	今就共論，故無四德。	003	Now, discussing the common, it lacks the four virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c19_14']	若中道理智及同緣示滅三種涅槃，此有得意及不得意。	若中道理智及同緣示滅三種涅槃，此有得意及不得意。	003	If the principle wisdom of the middle way and the three kinds of nirvana that demonstrate cessation by the same conditions, this has the meaning of understanding and not understanding.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c21_3']	其得意者，一必收二，三皆圓具，即成圓教大般涅槃，是今所喻。	其得意者，一必收二，三皆圓具，即成圓教大般涅槃，是今所喻。	003	Those who understand this, one must include two, and three are all perfectly complete, which becomes the perfect teaching of great parinirvāṇa, which is the present analogy.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c21_18']	今就失意互不相關者，故屬別耳。	今就失意互不相關者，故屬別耳。	003	Now, for those who misunderstand and are not mutually related, it is therefore separate.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c22_9']	若言等者，即地論師也。	若言等者，即地論師也。	003	If it is said, it is the masters of the Treatise on the Stages of Yoga Practice.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c24_2']	但以實相名為性淨，修因所成為方便淨，不明緣因薪盡火滅隨機涅槃。	但以實相名為性淨，修因所成為方便淨，不明緣因薪盡火滅隨機涅槃。	003	But only the characteristic of reality is called natural purity, and that which is accomplished by the cause of cultivation is expedient purity, not clarifying the parinirvāṇa that follows conditions when the fuel is exhausted and the fire extinguished.
['ZH_T39_1784_003:0024c25_10']	既但二種攝義不周，即非三德圓融涅槃，故非今經所喻之法。	既但二種攝義不周，即非三德圓融涅槃，故非今經所喻之法。	003	Since there are only two kinds and the meaning is not comprehensive, it is not the perfect and harmonious parinirvāṇa of the three virtues, and is therefore not the Dharma to be compared in this sūtra.

Before abiding, the wisdom of contemplation is all called feelings, let alone the human teacher's speculation, therefore it is said to be distant;

Although there is no word gold, since it is the Buddha's light and the Buddha's body is golden, this golden body and light all arise from the golden light of dharmatā, which is the functioning of phenomena.

Therefore, Miaole clarifies that the unconditioned nature of dharmas establishes all dharmas, which have four layers: in principle, it is the nature of causes and conditions; in phenomena, it is the three kinds of causes of cultivation; in delusion, it is the flowing of the three paths; in enlightenment, it is the superior function in the fruition.
