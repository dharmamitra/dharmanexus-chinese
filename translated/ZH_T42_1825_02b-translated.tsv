['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c20_15']	色無常即不三三。	色無常即不三三。	Form is impermanent, which is not three and three.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c21_4']	不可得謂三不三。	不可得謂三不三。	Cannot be attained refers to three and not three.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c21_16']	具破八倒備開實相中道也。	具破八倒備開實相中道也。	It completely breaks through the eight inverted views and fully reveals the real aspect of the Middle Way.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c22_10']	淨名不生不滅是無常義亦爾。	淨名不生不滅是無常義亦爾。	The Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa-sūtra's non-arising and non-ceasing is the meaning of impermanence is also like this.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c23_8']	次別敘來意亦有三。	次別敘來意亦有三。	Next, the specific explanation of the reason also has three parts.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c23_18']	一者若就無生義釋者。	一者若就無生義釋者。	First, if it is explained from the meaning of non-arising,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c24_12']	自上三門就四緣中求生不得。	自上三門就四緣中求生不得。	The above three gates seek the unobtainability of arising within the four conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c24_17']	惑者復謂。	惑者復謂。	Deluded ones may further think:
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c25_6']	若諸法畢竟無生。	若諸法畢竟無生。	If all dharmas are ultimately unborn,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c26_2']	何因緣故經說三相能生諸法耶。	何因緣故經說三相能生諸法耶。	why does the sūtra speak of the three characteristics as able to give rise to dharmas?
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c26_12']	今隨外所引故復破之。	今隨外所引故復破之。	Now, following what is brought up by others, it is further refuted.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c27_2']	所以言隨外所引者。	所以言隨外所引者。	The reason for saying following what is brought up by others is:
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c27_13']	三相猶屬四緣中因緣門。	三相猶屬四緣中因緣門。	The three characteristics still belong to the causal condition gate within the four conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c28_2']	上既求四緣無蹤。	上既求四緣無蹤。	Since the above has sought the four conditions without trace,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c28_7']	即無三相。	即無三相。	there are no three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c28_13']	但縱外言有。	但縱外言有。	It merely allows the external statement of existence.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c29_6']	故就覓無從故有此門來也。	故就覓無從故有此門來也。	Therefore, this gate comes to seek the absence of origination.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c29_17']	二者上破四緣破別生法。	二者上破四緣破別生法。	Second, the above refutes the four conditions to refute the separate arising of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a01_7']	今破三相破通生法。	今破三相破通生法。	Now, it refutes the three characteristics to refute the universal arising of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a01_17']	所以四緣是別生法者。	所以四緣是別生法者。	The reason the four conditions are the separate arising of dharmas is:
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a02_7']	如心法備從四緣生。	如心法備從四緣生。	Mental dharmas are fully born from the four conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a02_14']	色法從二緣生。	色法從二緣生。	Material dharmas arise from two conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a03_4']	非色非心開為二分。	非色非心開為二分。	Non-form and non-mind are divided into two parts.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a03_15']	無想滅盡二定從二緣生。	無想滅盡二定從二緣生。	The two concentrations of non-conceptualization and cessation arise from two conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a04_7']	自餘不相應法從二緣生。	自餘不相應法從二緣生。	The remaining non-associated compositional factors arise from two conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a04_13', 'ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a05_1']	故名別生法。🔽三相通生法者。	故名別生法。 三相通生法者。	Therefore, it is called a separately produced dharma.🔽Third, the three characteristics are common to produced dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a05_14']	有為三聚無不備從三相所生。	有為三聚無不備從三相所生。	The three aggregates of conditioned dharmas are all produced from the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a06_5']	今破三相名破通生法。	今破三相名破通生法。	Now, refuting the three characteristics is refuting the common production of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a06_13']	以通別求生不得。	以通別求生不得。	Because seeking production through the common and the specific is not obtained,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a07_1']	故知畢竟無生。	故知畢竟無生。	Therefore, it is known that ultimately there is no production.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a07_8']	三者三空分之。	三者三空分之。	Third, dividing it into the three emptinesses.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a08_2']	自上以來明求果及緣不可得。	自上以來明求果及緣不可得。	From above, it clarifies that seeking the effect and conditions is unobtainable,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a08_7']	名為空門。	名為空門。	Which is called the gate of emptiness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a09_1']	此下四品撿相無從名無相門。	此下四品撿相無從名無相門。	Below this, the four chapters investigate the characteristics that have no origin, which is the gate of signlessness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a09_18']	稟教之流若於空門悟入則不須無相門。	稟教之流若於空門悟入則不須無相門。	Those who receive the teachings, if they awaken and enter through the gate of emptiness, then they do not need the gate of signlessness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a10_14']	為於空門不悟是故次說無相門也。	為於空門不悟是故次說無相門也。	It is because they do not awaken to the gate of emptiness that the gate of signlessness is subsequently explained.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a11_2', 'ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a11_10']	又根性不同。🔽自有樂從空門入。	又根性不同。 自有樂從空門入。	Moreover, the capacities of sentient beings are not the same.🔽There are those who delight in entering through the gate of emptiness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a11_18']	自有從無相門入。	自有從無相門入。	There are those who enter through the gate of signlessness.

['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a14_16']	有為及無為二法俱無相。	有為及無為二法俱無相。	The two dharmas of the conditioned and the unconditioned are both signless.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a15_5']	則知通破一切諸相。	則知通破一切諸相。	Therefore, we know that it comprehensively refutes all signs.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a15_13']	故知是無相門也。	故知是無相門也。	Therefore, we know that this is the gate of signlessness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a16_5']	上三門破所相開為總別。	上三門破所相開為總別。	The previous three gates refute the characterized and open it into general and specific.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a16_14']	初門為總二門為別。	初門為總二門為別。	The first gate is general, and the second two gates are specific.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a17_3']	今四門破相亦二。	今四門破相亦二。	Now, the four gates that refute signs are also two.

['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a20_5']	若本無相則無法可相。	若本無相則無法可相。	If the signs originally do not exist, then there is no dharma that can be characterized.
