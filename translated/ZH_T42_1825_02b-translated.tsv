['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c23_8']	次別敘來意亦有三。	次別敘來意亦有三。	02b	Next, the specific explanation of the reason also has three parts.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c23_18']	一者若就無生義釋者。	一者若就無生義釋者。	02b	First, if it is explained from the meaning of non-arising,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c24_12']	自上三門就四緣中求生不得。	自上三門就四緣中求生不得。	02b	The above three gates seek the unobtainability of arising within the four conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c24_17']	惑者復謂。	惑者復謂。	02b	Deluded ones may further think:
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c25_6']	若諸法畢竟無生。	若諸法畢竟無生。	02b	If all dharmas are ultimately unborn,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c26_2']	何因緣故經說三相能生諸法耶。	何因緣故經說三相能生諸法耶。	02b	why does the sūtra speak of the three characteristics as able to give rise to dharmas?
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c26_12']	今隨外所引故復破之。	今隨外所引故復破之。	02b	Now, following what is brought up by others, it is further refuted.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c27_2']	所以言隨外所引者。	所以言隨外所引者。	02b	The reason for saying following what is brought up by others is:
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c27_13']	三相猶屬四緣中因緣門。	三相猶屬四緣中因緣門。	02b	The three characteristics still belong to the causal condition gate within the four conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c28_2']	上既求四緣無蹤。	上既求四緣無蹤。	02b	Since the above has sought the four conditions without trace,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c28_7']	即無三相。	即無三相。	02b	there are no three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c28_13']	但縱外言有。	但縱外言有。	02b	It merely allows the external statement of existence.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c29_6']	故就覓無從故有此門來也。	故就覓無從故有此門來也。	02b	Therefore, this gate comes to seek the absence of origination.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0196c29_17']	二者上破四緣破別生法。	二者上破四緣破別生法。	02b	Second, the above refutes the four conditions to refute the separate arising of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a01_7']	今破三相破通生法。	今破三相破通生法。	02b	Now, it refutes the three characteristics to refute the universal arising of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a01_17']	所以四緣是別生法者。	所以四緣是別生法者。	02b	The reason the four conditions are the separate arising of dharmas is:
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a02_7']	如心法備從四緣生。	如心法備從四緣生。	02b	Mental dharmas are fully born from the four conditions.

['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a04_7']	自餘不相應法從二緣生。	自餘不相應法從二緣生。	02b	The remaining non-associated compositional factors arise from two conditions.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a04_13', 'ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a05_1']	故名別生法。🔽三相通生法者。	故名別生法。 三相通生法者。	02b	Therefore, it is called a separately produced dharma.🔽Third, the three characteristics are common to produced dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a05_14']	有為三聚無不備從三相所生。	有為三聚無不備從三相所生。	02b	The three aggregates of conditioned dharmas are all produced from the three characteristics.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a06_5']	今破三相名破通生法。	今破三相名破通生法。	02b	Now, refuting the three characteristics is refuting the common production of dharmas.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a06_13']	以通別求生不得。	以通別求生不得。	02b	Because seeking production through the common and the specific is not obtained,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a07_1']	故知畢竟無生。	故知畢竟無生。	02b	Therefore, it is known that ultimately there is no production.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a07_8']	三者三空分之。	三者三空分之。	02b	Third, dividing it into the three emptinesses.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a08_2']	自上以來明求果及緣不可得。	自上以來明求果及緣不可得。	02b	From above, it clarifies that seeking the effect and conditions is unobtainable,
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a08_7']	名為空門。	名為空門。	02b	Which is called the gate of emptiness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a09_1']	此下四品撿相無從名無相門。	此下四品撿相無從名無相門。	02b	Below this, the four chapters investigate the characteristics that have no origin, which is the gate of signlessness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a09_18']	稟教之流若於空門悟入則不須無相門。	稟教之流若於空門悟入則不須無相門。	02b	Those who receive the teachings, if they awaken and enter through the gate of emptiness, then they do not need the gate of signlessness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a10_14']	為於空門不悟是故次說無相門也。	為於空門不悟是故次說無相門也。	02b	It is because they do not awaken to the gate of emptiness that the gate of signlessness is subsequently explained.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a11_2', 'ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a11_10']	又根性不同。🔽自有樂從空門入。	又根性不同。 自有樂從空門入。	02b	Moreover, the capacities of sentient beings are not the same.🔽There are those who delight in entering through the gate of emptiness.

['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a14_16']	有為及無為二法俱無相。	有為及無為二法俱無相。	02b	The two dharmas of the conditioned and the unconditioned are both signless.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a15_5']	則知通破一切諸相。	則知通破一切諸相。	02b	Therefore, we know that it comprehensively refutes all signs.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a15_13']	故知是無相門也。	故知是無相門也。	02b	Therefore, we know that this is the gate of signlessness.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a16_5']	上三門破所相開為總別。	上三門破所相開為總別。	02b	The previous three gates refute the characterized and open it into general and specific.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a16_14']	初門為總二門為別。	初門為總二門為別。	02b	The first gate is general, and the second two gates are specific.
['ZH_T42_1825_02b:0197a17_3']	今四門破相亦二。	今四門破相亦二。	02b	Now, the four gates that refute signs are also two.
