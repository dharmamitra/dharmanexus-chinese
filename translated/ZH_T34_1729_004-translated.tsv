['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952b25_15']	初教得道雖曰甘露，既非第五醍醐之味，豈得度於二種生死？	初教得道雖曰甘露，既非第五醍醐之味，豈得度於二種生死？	Although attaining the Way in the initial teaching is called sweet dew, since it is not the fifth taste of pure ghee, how can it transcend the two kinds of birth and death?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952b26_2']	故未名得度。	故未名得度。	Therefore, it is not yet called attaining liberation.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952b28_12']	但用一門解脫虛妄見思之縛，其實未得一切境界解脫塵沙無明惑累，其至靈山方證斯脫。	但用一門解脫虛妄見思之縛，其實未得一切境界解脫塵沙無明惑累，其至靈山方證斯脫。	But by using only one approach to liberate from the bonds of false views and thoughts, in reality one has not yet attained liberation from all realms, from the dust and sand of afflictions and the bonds of ignorance. One will only attain liberation at Vulture Peak.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c02_4']	此中乃以證小之後遇大不聞，以驗在凡機不受大，以聾啞文在經後分。	此中乃以證小之後遇大不聞，以驗在凡機不受大，以聾啞文在經後分。	Here, it uses the fact that after realizing the small, one encounters the great but does not hear it, to verify that the capacity in the ordinary person does not accept the great, with the text of deafness and muteness in the later part of the sutra.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c03_7']	其時仍長，義當方等般若之時，亦可通在鹿苑之前。	其時仍長，義當方等般若之時，亦可通在鹿苑之前。	At that time, it is still long, and the meaning corresponds to the time of Vaipulya and Prajna, or it can be generally before the Deer Park.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c04_20']	是故迦葉却敘小機蒙大擬時迷悶躄地，以後顯前，機未堪大，其意宛然。	是故迦葉却敘小機蒙大擬時迷悶躄地，以後顯前，機未堪大，其意宛然。	Therefore, Kasyapa retrospectively narrates the small capacity being shrouded by the great when proposed, at that time confused and falling to the ground. By showing the later to reveal the earlier, the capacity was not yet able to receive the great, and the meaning is evident.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c06_4']	雖有冥益，其如見愛熾然現行，故機在華嚴，全生如乳。	雖有冥益，其如見愛熾然現行，故機在華嚴，全生如乳。	Although there is mysterious benefit, it is like the view and love burning and presently operating, therefore the capacity is in the Huayan, completely living like milk.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c06_17']	二、「聞方」下，於小名酪。	二、「聞方」下，於小名酪。	Second, below hearing the method is called curd in the small [vehicle].
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c09_3']	急追付財稱怨大喚，徐語除糞歡喜隨來，乃施方便說三界苦，以畏苦故斷見思集，既革凡成聖，名轉乳為酪。	急追付財稱怨大喚，徐語除糞歡喜隨來，乃施方便說三界苦，以畏苦故斷見思集，既革凡成聖，名轉乳為酪。	Quickly chasing and entrusting with wealth, shouting complaints, slowly speaking of removing excrement, happily following to come, then using skillful means to speak of the suffering of the three realms, because of fearing suffering, one severs the views and thoughts of suffering, and having already reformed the ordinary and accomplished the sage, it is called transforming milk into curd.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c09_12']	「次聞」下，生酥。	「次聞」下，生酥。	Next, hearing below is fresh butter.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c12_20']	應知約教明五味者，不取濃淡，但語相生，以其頓乳即醍醐故。	應知約教明五味者，不取濃淡，但語相生，以其頓乳即醍醐故。	You should know that in terms of the teachings, the five flavors are not taken as thick or thin, but only speak of mutual generation, because the sudden milk is itself ghee.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c14_16']	若約機者有濃淡義，然就三乘極鈍者說，為此一類於彼華嚴全無顯益，如鯹血乳；	若約機者有濃淡義，然就三乘極鈍者說，為此一類於彼華嚴全無顯益，如鯹血乳；	If in terms of the capacities, there is the meaning of thick and thin, however, this is said for the most dull of the three vehicles, for this one type there is no manifest benefit in the Flower Ornament Sutra, like rotten blood milk;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c15_16']	說三藏時，此機成酪，次第漸濃至於極味。	說三藏時，此機成酪，次第漸濃至於極味。	when the Tripiṭaka is spoken, this capacity becomes curd, gradually becoming thicker up to the ultimate flavor.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c16_4']	「次聞」下，熟酥。	「次聞」下，熟酥。	Next, hearing refers to the stage of ripened butter.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c17_11']	不談三藏，具示衍三，利根之人入圓者眾，聲聞至此被加轉教。	不談三藏，具示衍三，利根之人入圓者眾，聲聞至此被加轉教。	Not discussing the Tripiṭaka, it fully demonstrates the three of the Mahāyāna. Many of the sharp-witted enter the perfect. The śrāvakas, having reached this point, are empowered to turn the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c18_19']	既於真空具談萬行，故令鈍根冥得別益，約調漸機名熟酥味。	既於真空具談萬行，故令鈍根冥得別益，約調漸機名熟酥味。	Since it fully discusses the myriad practices in true emptiness, it causes the dull-witted to secretly obtain separate benefits. It is called the stage of ripened butter in terms of gradually guiding the faculties.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c19_12']	四、「次聞」下，醍醐，二：	四、「次聞」下，醍醐，二：	Fourth, next, hearing refers to the stage of ghee, which has two parts:

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c20_2']	初、明三乘皆得成佛。	初、明三乘皆得成佛。	First, clarifying that the three vehicles can all attain Buddhahood.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c22_8']	捨前三教方便四諦，但說一實無上之道，復開三教方便之門皆是一乘真實之相，乃是此經待絕二妙。	捨前三教方便四諦，但說一實無上之道，復開三教方便之門皆是一乘真實之相，乃是此經待絕二妙。	Abandoning the expedient four truths of the previous three teachings, it only expounds the one true unsurpassed path. It also opens the expedient gates of the three teachings, all of which are the true characteristics of the One Vehicle. This is the two kinds of marvelousness of the Lotus Sūtra, in terms of the provisional and the absolute.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c24_2']	談茲妙故，方令二乘焦穀更生，三教菩薩權疑永息，是故無一不成佛者。	談茲妙故，方令二乘焦穀更生，三教菩薩權疑永息，是故無一不成佛者。	Because it discusses this marvelousness, it causes the burnt seeds of the two vehicles to sprout again, and the provisional doubts of the bodhisattvas of the three teachings to be forever extinguished. Therefore, there is not a single one who does not become a Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c24_18']	二、「故云」下，證一代俱入醍醐。	二、「故云」下，證一代俱入醍醐。	Second, therefore it is said below, the evidence that the entire lifetime [of the Buddha] enters into the stage of ghee.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c25_10']	若大機先熟，華嚴初見即入佛慧；	若大機先熟，華嚴初見即入佛慧；	If those with great capacity are ripe first, they will enter the Buddha's wisdom upon first seeing the Flower Ornament Sutra;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c26_10']	若小機先熟，即須漸引，今聞開廢方得佛慧。	若小機先熟，即須漸引，今聞開廢方得佛慧。	If those with lesser capacity are ripe first, they must be gradually guided, and now, upon hearing the disclosure of the abandonment, they will attain the Buddha's wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c27_14']	初得今得皆是佛慧，俱譬醍醐，但彼兼別、至此純圓。	初得今得皆是佛慧，俱譬醍醐，但彼兼別、至此純圓。	Both the initial attainment and the present attainment are the Buddha's wisdom, both are likened to the finest ghee, but the former includes the separate teachings, while this is purely the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c28_9']	二、「若復」下，涅槃開顯之意法華具彰。	二、「若復」下，涅槃開顯之意法華具彰。	Second, below if again, the meaning of the disclosure in the Nirvana Sutra is fully revealed in the Lotus Sutra.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0952c29_8']	執權之機大陣已破，更須涅槃收其餘黨。	執權之機大陣已破，更須涅槃收其餘黨。	The great army of those who cling to the provisional teachings has already been defeated, and they still need the Nirvana Sutra to gather the remaining factions.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a01_12']	故法華後復談般若調熟其心，令於涅槃得醍醐味。	故法華後復談般若調熟其心，令於涅槃得醍醐味。	Therefore, after the Lotus Sutra, it further discusses prajna to adjust and mature their minds, enabling them to obtain the taste of the finest ghee in the Nirvana Sutra.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a03_4']	是故彼經就《般若》部後分結撮五味次第云「從摩訶般若出大涅槃」。	是故彼經就《般若》部後分結撮五味次第云「從摩訶般若出大涅槃」。	Thus, that sutra, based on the latter part of the prajna section, summarizes the sequence of the five flavors, saying, The Great Nirvana Sutra emerges from the Great Prajna Sutra.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a03_18']	說勝三修者，彼經明三種三修：	說勝三修者，彼經明三種三修：	As for speaking of the superior three cultivations, that sutra clarifies three kinds of three cultivations:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a04_18']	一邪、二劣、三勝，邪即世間邪師所教常樂我也；	一邪、二劣、三勝，邪即世間邪師所教常樂我也；	First, the false, second, the inferior, and third, the superior. The false refers to the eternal, blissful self taught by worldly false teachers;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a05_18']	劣即依佛半教破於邪執，謂無常無樂無我也；	劣即依佛半教破於邪執，謂無常無樂無我也；	The inferior refers to relying on half of the Buddha's teachings to destroy wrong attachments, namely, impermanence, no bliss, and no self;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a06_16']	勝即依佛勝教破於劣修，謂常樂我也。	勝即依佛勝教破於劣修，謂常樂我也。	The superior refers to relying on the Buddha's superior teachings to destroy inferior practices, namely, permanence, bliss, and self.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a08_19']	法身常恒無有變易，遊諸覺華歡娛受樂，具八自在無能遏絕，如是修者入祕密藏，名勝三修。	法身常恒無有變易，遊諸覺華歡娛受樂，具八自在無能遏絕，如是修者入祕密藏，名勝三修。	The Dharma body is eternally unchanging, roaming among the flowers of enlightenment, joyfully experiencing bliss, endowed with the eight liberations, and cannot be obstructed. One who practices in this way enters the secret treasury, called the superior three cultivations.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a09_12']	二、「是為」下，結例，三：	二、「是為」下，結例，三：	Second, this is called and below, the conclusion by analogy, in three parts:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a09_18']	初、結佛身。	初、結佛身。	First, concluding the Buddha's body.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a10_1']	二、「或示」下，例餘身。	二、「或示」下，例餘身。	Second, sometimes manifesting and below, exemplifying the other bodies.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a11_8']	佛身既能說五時教，若示餘身，亦於五時引諸實行隨味而轉。	佛身既能說五時教，若示餘身，亦於五時引諸實行隨味而轉。	Since the Buddha's body can expound the teachings of the five periods, if manifesting other bodies, it also leads the true practitioners in the five periods to turn according to the flavors.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a12_18']	復須論於示現多身度於一人，或一度多、或一度一、或多度多。	復須論於示現多身度於一人，或一度多、或一度一、或多度多。	It is also necessary to discuss manifesting many bodies to deliver one person, or delivering many with one, or delivering many with many.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a14_14']	約人既爾，人法因果多少相對各成四句，故初懸敘立三四句，方盡身說感應之相。	約人既爾，人法因果多少相對各成四句，故初懸敘立三四句，方盡身說感應之相。	Since it is so in terms of people, the various relative numbers of people, dharmas, causes, and effects each form four propositions. Therefore, the initial general explanation establishes the three or four propositions, fully exhausting the characteristics of the body and speech responding to beings.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a15_3']	三、「穢國」下，例淨土。	三、「穢國」下，例淨土。	Third, defiled lands and below, give examples of pure lands.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a16_12']	如安樂世界，菩薩無數聲聞亦然，良以法有頓漸，是故人分大小。	如安樂世界，菩薩無數聲聞亦然，良以法有頓漸，是故人分大小。	Like the Land of Bliss, with countless bodhisattvas and hearers as well. The reason is that the Dharma has sudden and gradual, therefore the people are divided into great and small.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a17_12']	具如九品生彼土後，入大小位，皆由聞法。	具如九品生彼土後，入大小位，皆由聞法。	Fully like the nine grades of rebirth in that land, later entering the great and small stages, all due to hearing the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a18_10']	驗知應彼淨土度生，須論漸頓二種身說。	驗知應彼淨土度生，須論漸頓二種身說。	It is verified that responding to beings in the pure lands requires discussing the two kinds of body and speech, sudden and gradual.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a21_15']	二、「此中」下，本觀慈悲，如上所明，三土垂形、五時化物，穢指釋迦、淨約彌陀，二佛化事教文備彰，以顯觀音示現佛身與此不異，分真究竟體用同故。	二、「此中」下，本觀慈悲，如上所明，三土垂形、五時化物，穢指釋迦、淨約彌陀，二佛化事教文備彰，以顯觀音示現佛身與此不異，分真究竟體用同故。	Second, Herein and below, the fundamental contemplation of compassion, as explained above, manifests in the three lands and transforms beings in the five periods. Defiled refers to Shakyamuni, pure to Amitabha. The teachings and texts of the two Buddhas' transformative activities are fully revealed, showing that Avalokitesvara's manifestation of the Buddha's body is no different from this, because the essence and function of the ultimate truth are the same.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a22_6']	果用若此，豈無本因？	果用若此，豈無本因？	If the fruition function is like this, how can there be no fundamental cause?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a24_3']	故今却尋本觀誓願，是修別圓觀行之時起慈悲誓，期遍法界現身說法度諸眾生。	故今却尋本觀誓願，是修別圓觀行之時起慈悲誓，期遍法界現身說法度諸眾生。	Therefore, now we trace back to the original contemplation and vows. This is when the practice of the distinct and perfect contemplations gives rise to compassion and vows, vowing to manifest the body and expound the Dharma throughout the Dharma realm to deliver all sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a25_6']	今住寂光本誓所熏，能遍三土，形聲利益例前赴難。	今住寂光本誓所熏，能遍三土，形聲利益例前赴難。	Now abiding in the eternally quiescent light, the original vows permeate, able to pervade the three lands, benefiting with form and sound, exemplifying the previous response to difficulties.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a25_15']	本誓文中已備說也。	本誓文中已備說也。	The original vows are already fully explained in the text.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a28_4']	娑婆之名翻為堪忍，於同居中尚不通淨，那得具約三土釋邪？	娑婆之名翻為堪忍，於同居中尚不通淨，那得具約三土釋邪？	The name Saha means endurance. It does not even apply to the pure lands within the same realm. How can it be used to explain the three lands?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a28_8']	二、答。	二、答。	Second, the answer.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953a29_16']	菩薩舉一以為問端，如來稱法周遍為答，故云以種種形遊諸國土。	菩薩舉一以為問端，如來稱法周遍為答，故云以種種形遊諸國土。	The bodhisattva raises one as the starting point for the question, and the Tathagata answers by referring to the Dharma pervading everywhere, thus saying with various forms, wandering through the lands.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b02_1']	橫亘十方竪徹三土，故言諸也，皆是觀音應身遊處。	橫亘十方竪徹三土，故言諸也，皆是觀音應身遊處。	It extends horizontally throughout the ten directions and vertically through the three lands, thus it says various. They are all the places where Avalokitesvara's response body wanders.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b05_17']	經示方便及實報土不離娑婆，故云「若聞長壽深心信解，則為見佛常在耆闍崛山，共大菩薩諸聲聞眾圍繞說法。	經示方便及實報土不離娑婆，故云「若聞長壽深心信解，則為見佛常在耆闍崛山，共大菩薩諸聲聞眾圍繞說法。	The sutra shows that the lands of expedient means and true reward are not apart from Saha, thus saying, If one hears of the long life and deeply believes and understands it, then one will see the Buddha always on Vulture Peak, surrounded by great bodhisattvas and shravakas, expounding the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b06_15']	」既云常在耆山，則劫火洞然此土安隱。	」既云常在耆山，則劫火洞然此土安隱。	Since it says the Buddha is always on Vulture Peak, then this land is peaceful and secure even when the kalpa fire burns.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b07_18']	復以菩薩共諸聲聞而為聽眾，豈非娑婆即方便土？	復以菩薩共諸聲聞而為聽眾，豈非娑婆即方便土？	Moreover, bodhisattvas and shravakas are the listening assembly. How is this not Saha being the land of expedient means?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b09_12']	復云「又見娑婆世界其地瑠璃，乃至樓觀皆悉寶成，其菩薩眾咸處其中。	復云「又見娑婆世界其地瑠璃，乃至樓觀皆悉寶成，其菩薩眾咸處其中。	It also says, One also sees the Saha world, its ground is lapis lazuli, and the towers and pavilions are all made of jewels, with the assembly of bodhisattvas all dwelling within.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b11_1']	」既云又見，即非前處唯有菩薩不共聲聞，即純菩薩而為僧也。	」既云又見，即非前處唯有菩薩不共聲聞，即純菩薩而為僧也。	Since it says one also sees, it is not the previous place. There are only bodhisattvas, not shared with shravakas. This is purely bodhisattvas as the sangha.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b11_10']	驗知娑婆即是實報。	驗知娑婆即是實報。	This verifies that Saha is the land of true reward.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b15_18']	《大論》云「出三界外有淨土，聲聞辟支佛出生其中，受法性身非分段生」，即方便土也。	《大論》云「出三界外有淨土，聲聞辟支佛出生其中，受法性身非分段生」，即方便土也。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, Outside the three realms there is a pure land, where śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are born, and they receive the body of dharma-nature, not born from the aggregation of causes and conditions, which is the land of skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b17_18']	《大品》云「法身佛為法性身菩薩說法」，其聽法眾非生死人，但云菩薩不共二乘，即實報土也。	《大品》云「法身佛為法性身菩薩說法」，其聽法眾非生死人，但云菩薩不共二乘，即實報土也。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra says, The Buddha of the Dharma-body expounds the Dharma for bodhisattvas of the body of dharma-nature, and the assembly listening to the Dharma is not a person of birth and death, but it only says bodhisattvas do not share with the two vehicles, which is the land of recompense.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b18_12']	二土不同皆稱法性，云何分別？	二土不同皆稱法性，云何分別？	The two lands are different and both are called the dharma-nature, how can they be distinguished?

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b19_18']	小乘灰斷無界外生，論云出界復云受身，此據大說。	小乘灰斷無界外生，論云出界復云受身，此據大說。	The Hīnayāna is extinguished without rebirth outside the realms, the treatise says it is beyond the realms and yet it says it receives a body, this is based on the Mahāyāna teaching.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b20_16']	大乘法性體本常住，即是一切色心之源。	大乘法性體本常住，即是一切色心之源。	The substance of the Mahāyāna dharma-nature is originally eternally abiding, which is the source of all form and mind.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b23_16']	大說色心因惑生滅，不因惑有，體是法性，見思若盡，無明全在，則當真諦法性色心。	大說色心因惑生滅，不因惑有，體是法性，見思若盡，無明全在，則當真諦法性色心。	The great teaching says that form and mind are caused by delusion and arising and ceasing, and are not caused by delusion. Their essence is the nature of dharmas. If views and thoughts are exhausted, and ignorance remains complete, then it corresponds to the nature of dharmas of form and mind in the truth of ultimate reality.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b24_18']	方便生滅無明分破，本性分顯，義當中道法性色心。	方便生滅無明分破，本性分顯，義當中道法性色心。	In the arising and ceasing of skillful means, ignorance is partially destroyed, and the inherent nature is partially revealed. The meaning is in the middle way, the nature of dharmas of form and mind.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b26_7']	實報生滅，無明究盡，則復本性常住色心離生滅相，常寂光也。	實報生滅，無明究盡，則復本性常住色心離生滅相，常寂光也。	In the arising and ceasing of the true reward, ignorance is completely exhausted, and then it returns to the inherent nature, the eternally abiding form and mind, free from the characteristics of arising and ceasing, which is the eternally quiescent light.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953b27_11']	今明方便及實報土，法性名同，約斷惑論，真中大異。	今明方便及實報土，法性名同，約斷惑論，真中大異。	Now, it is explained that in the lands of skillful means and true reward, the names of the nature of dharmas are the same, but in terms of severing delusions, the truth and middle way are greatly different.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c03_16']	若委論者，頓中別鈍、漸中圓利。	若委論者，頓中別鈍、漸中圓利。	If discussed in detail, those in the sudden teachings have dull faculties, while those in the perfect teaching of the gradual teachings have sharp faculties.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c05_3']	所說之法隨機廢興，輔佛菩薩亦隨改轉，不可文備宜準教思。	所說之法隨機廢興，輔佛菩薩亦隨改轉，不可文備宜準教思。	The Dharma that is expounded arises and disappears according to the capacities of beings. The bodhisattvas who assist the Buddha also change accordingly. The text cannot cover everything, so one should think according to the teachings.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c06_16']	若論獨覺，既不值佛稟教，何能說法？	若論獨覺，既不值佛稟教，何能說法？	If discussing the solitary realizers, since they do not encounter the Buddha and receive the teachings, how can they expound the Dharma?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c07_6']	欲化眾生，但現神變。	欲化眾生，但現神變。	If wishing to transform beings, they only manifest spiritual transformations.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c08_2']	今云說法，乃論佛世稟因緣教者也。	今云說法，乃論佛世稟因緣教者也。	Now saying they expound the Dharma refers to those in the Buddha's time who received the teachings on dependent origination.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c12_4']	外示權跡，意在莊嚴涅槃雙樹。	外示權跡，意在莊嚴涅槃雙樹。	Externally demonstrating the traces of skillful means, the intention is in adorning the twin trees of nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c13_12']	言雙樹者，四方各雙，東方一雙一枯一榮，南西北方亦復如是。	言雙樹者，四方各雙，東方一雙一枯一榮，南西北方亦復如是。	As for the twin trees, there are two in each of the four directions. In the east, one is withered and one is flourishing. It is the same in the south, west, and north.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c14_17']	東方枯榮表常無常，南樂無樂，西我無我，北淨不淨。	東方枯榮表常無常，南樂無樂，西我無我，北淨不淨。	The withered and flourishing in the east represent permanence and impermanence, pleasure and lack of pleasure in the south, self and lack of self in the west, and purity and impurity in the north.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c16_1']	如來於中，北首而臥入般涅槃，則表雙非常無常等。	如來於中，北首而臥入般涅槃，則表雙非常無常等。	The Tathāgata lay down with his head in the north and entered parinirvāṇa, which represents both permanence and impermanence, etc.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c18_5']	經文略舉因中六人，即是身子、目連、空生、那律、迦葉、阿難，及果一人即如來是，此皆善能莊嚴雙樹。	經文略舉因中六人，即是身子、目連、空生、那律、迦葉、阿難，及果一人即如來是，此皆善能莊嚴雙樹。	The sūtra text briefly mentions the six people in the cause, namely Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana, Subhūti, Aniruddha, Kāśyapa, and Ānanda, and the one person in the effect is the Tathāgata. All of these are able to well adorn the twin trees.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c19_17']	斯蓋如來與身子等久證三德，欲令眾生得入祕藏，雙非常等真四德故。	斯蓋如來與身子等久證三德，欲令眾生得入祕藏，雙非常等真四德故。	This is because the Tathagata and Shariputra and others have long realized the three virtues, wanting to enable sentient beings to enter the secret treasury and the true four virtues of impermanence and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c21_11']	初於三藏主伴相與同諸實行，殷勤修證無常無樂無我無淨，成四枯也。	初於三藏主伴相與同諸實行，殷勤修證無常無樂無我無淨，成四枯也。	First, in the Tripiṭaka, the host and companions together share the various real practices, diligently cultivating and realizing impermanence, no joy, no self, and no purity, forming the four withering [teachings].
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c23_9']	次於二酥，褒圓折偏恥小慕大，說菩薩法，引諸眾生破於無常修學常等，成四榮也。	次於二酥，褒圓折偏恥小慕大，說菩薩法，引諸眾生破於無常修學常等，成四榮也。	Next, in the two kinds of parables, praising the perfect and criticizing the biased, shaming the small and admiring the great, expounding the bodhisattva teachings, guiding sentient beings to destroy impermanence and cultivate permanence and so forth, forming the four flourishing [teachings].
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c25_2']	至法華會及今涅槃，引諸眾生皆同證入非枯非榮中道四德大般涅槃。	至法華會及今涅槃，引諸眾生皆同證入非枯非榮中道四德大般涅槃。	Up to the Lotus Sutra assembly and now the Nirvana Sutra, guiding sentient beings to all equally realize and enter the four virtues of the middle way, neither withering nor flourishing, the great parinirvāṇa.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c27_4']	經示主伴一代化功今已成就，乃於雙樹中間涅槃而表顯之，故云六人及以如來能嚴雙樹。	經示主伴一代化功今已成就，乃於雙樹中間涅槃而表顯之，故云六人及以如來能嚴雙樹。	The sūtra shows the host and companions, the transformative power of the entire era, now already accomplished, and thus enters parinirvāṇa between the twin trees to manifest and reveal it, thus saying the six people and the Tathāgata can adorn the twin trees.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c27_18']	觀音示現聲聞之身，其意如是。	觀音示現聲聞之身，其意如是。	Avalokiteśvara manifests the body of a śrāvaka, his intention is like this.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0953c28_9']	二、「次引」下，能現人。	二、「次引」下，能現人。	Second, Next, the able manifestation of people refers to the able manifestation of people.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a01_5']	善財所見諸善知識，如海雲比丘、善住比丘，現聲聞身說別圓法，二乘機扣即說藏通。	善財所見諸善知識，如海雲比丘、善住比丘，現聲聞身說別圓法，二乘機扣即說藏通。	The good and virtuous friends seen by Sudhana, such as the bhikṣu Saṃbhūta and the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, manifest the body of śrāvakas and expound the distinct and perfect teachings. When the faculties of the two vehicles prompt them, they then expound the teachings of the Āgamas and Abhidharma.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a01_18']	既住不思議法門，何所不說？	既住不思議法門，何所不說？	Since they abide in the inconceivable Dharma door, what is there that they do not expound?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a02_7']	此合今文人法四句。	此合今文人法四句。	This corresponds to the four statements on people and dharmas in the present text.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a04_13']	上總約法彰能現人，今此的示現小之術，故引大經四種之智觀十二緣得四乘果。	上總約法彰能現人，今此的示現小之術，故引大經四種之智觀十二緣得四乘果。	Above, it generally discusses the able manifestation of people based on the dharmas. Now, this specifically shows the method of manifesting the small, and thus it cites the four kinds of wisdom in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra that observe the twelve links of dependent arising and attain the fruits of the four vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a06_18']	觀音若修別觀則次第用四智觀緣，若修圓觀則一心用四因緣智，而於一一皆起誓願度諸眾生。	觀音若修別觀則次第用四智觀緣，若修圓觀則一心用四因緣智，而於一一皆起誓願度諸眾生。	If Avalokiteśvara cultivates the distinct contemplation, then he sequentially uses the four wisdoms to contemplate the conditions. If he cultivates the perfect contemplation, then he uses the four wisdoms of the conditions with one mind, and in each he gives rise to vows to deliver all sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a08_19']	不取四相、不捨四法，不取故非有、不捨故非空，雙遮二邊即無緣誓，雙照生法即四慈悲。	不取四相、不捨四法，不取故非有、不捨故非空，雙遮二邊即無緣誓，雙照生法即四慈悲。	Not grasping the four characteristics and not abandoning the four dharmas, not grasping is not existence, not abandoning is not emptiness. The mutual negation of the two extremes is the vow without conditions, and the mutual illumination of birth and dharmas is the four kinds of compassion.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a09_17']	今行願成，故遍法界現四形聲普應一切。	今行願成，故遍法界現四形聲普應一切。	Now that the practice and vows are accomplished, the four forms and sounds appear throughout the Dharma realm, universally responding to all.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a10_12']	今於四中，的取下智為能現法。	今於四中，的取下智為能現法。	Now, among the four, specifically taking the lower wisdom as the Dharma that is able to appear.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a11_1']	四、「問」下，寄料簡，二：	四、「問」下，寄料簡，二：	Fourth, below questions, entrusting to a brief analysis, two:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a11_5']	初、問。	初、問。	First, the question.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a13_1']	因前分別以十界身應十界機，一多交互雖成四句，而終有佛度於佛界，故有今問。	因前分別以十界身應十界機，一多交互雖成四句，而終有佛度於佛界，故有今問。	Based on the previous distinctions, using the bodies of the ten realms to respond to the capacities of the ten realms, although the one and many interact to form four statements, in the end there is a Buddha度ing the Buddha realm, so there is this question now.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a13_16']	答中等覺度初地者，約別教義也。	答中等覺度初地者，約別教義也。	The answer, the equal enlightenment度ing the initial ground, is based on the meaning of the separate teaching.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a14_15']	以圓六即佛義太寬，別教登地佛界義顯。	以圓六即佛義太寬，別教登地佛界義顯。	Because the meaning of the six identities of the Buddha in the perfect teaching is too broad, the meaning of the Buddha realm in the separate teaching's stages of ground is evident.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a14_18']	何者？	何者？	What is the reason?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a16_13']	別教三賢用於三乘所修觀法，入地證中逈超九界，始本分合體用同佛故。	別教三賢用於三乘所修觀法，入地證中逈超九界，始本分合體用同佛故。	In the Distinct Teaching, the three ranks of worthies use the methods of contemplation cultivated by the three vehicles. Entering the grounds and realizing the middle, they soar beyond the nine realms. The beginning and end are divided and combined, and the essence and function are the same as the Buddha's.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a18_7']	然是分證，惑必厚薄、智論淺深，是故上位現化他佛，度於下位自行之佛。	然是分證，惑必厚薄、智論淺深，是故上位現化他佛，度於下位自行之佛。	However, this is partial realization. Delusion must be thick or thin, and wisdom must be shallow or deep. Therefore, the higher rank manifests the Buddha of benefiting others and saves the Buddha of benefiting oneself in the lower rank.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a21_2']	取譬人中師度弟子，須知能度之佛或現八相、或坐華王，所度之佛必作因身，以佛威儀非稟法相，故四教佛皆無師智。	取譬人中師度弟子，須知能度之佛或現八相、或坐華王，所度之佛必作因身，以佛威儀非稟法相，故四教佛皆無師智。	Using the analogy of a teacher in the human realm saving his disciples, one must know that the Buddha who can save may manifest the eight appearances or sit on the Flower King. The Buddha who is saved must take on a causal body, because the dignified deportment of a Buddha is not the Dharma appearance of a disciple. Therefore, the Buddhas of the four teachings all have the wisdom without a teacher.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a23_10']	又今一往且云等覺度於初地，若本下跡高，可云初地度於等覺，以示佛跡是妙覺身，乃由極果加被故也。	又今一往且云等覺度於初地，若本下跡高，可云初地度於等覺，以示佛跡是妙覺身，乃由極果加被故也。	Moreover, now I will provisionally say that the stage of equal enlightenment saves the first ground. If the original lower traces are lofty, one can say that the first ground saves the stage of equal enlightenment, showing that the Buddha's traces are the body of wondrous enlightenment, which is due to the empowerment of the ultimate fruit.

Avalokitesvara, during the cause stage, contemplated whiteness, which is emptiness, provisional, and middle. Abiding in the Dharma realm of whiteness is precisely this true and eternal self-nature, called the samādhi of the king.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a27_19']	不取不捨者，不取此禪有相，謂見思也；	不取不捨者，不取此禪有相，謂見思也；	Not grasping and not abandoning means not grasping the characteristics of this meditation, which are seen and contemplated;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a28_9']	不取此禪空相，塵沙也。	不取此禪空相，塵沙也。	not grasping the empty characteristics of this meditation, which are dust and sand;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954a29_9']	不取此禪亦有亦無相、非有非無相，無明也。	不取此禪亦有亦無相、非有非無相，無明也。	not grasping the characteristics of this meditation that are both existent and nonexistent, nor the characteristics that are neither existent nor nonexistent, which are ignorance.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0954b01_3']	則不隨三惑，生於此禪三土也。	則不隨三惑，生於此禪三土也。	Then one does not follow the three delusions and give rise to the three lands of this meditation.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a15_14']	經以事瓔表於行瓔，諸地功德莊嚴法身既有階差，故以世寶貴賤為表。	經以事瓔表於行瓔，諸地功德莊嚴法身既有階差，故以世寶貴賤為表。	The sutra uses the actual necklace to illustrate the necklace of practice. Since the merits and virtues of the various grounds adorn the Dharma body and there are distinctions, it uses the preciousness and cheapness of worldly treasures to illustrate it.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a17_3']	今無盡意入位既高，瓔珞合用無價之寶，豈可止直十萬兩金？	今無盡意入位既高，瓔珞合用無價之寶，豈可止直十萬兩金？	Now, since Inexhaustible Intent has entered a high stage, the necklace should be made of priceless jewels. How can it be worth only 100,000 taels of gold?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a17_7']	二、答。	二、答。	Second, the answer.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a18_4']	言百千者，略舉多數，如云百姓，豈局一百？	言百千者，略舉多數，如云百姓，豈局一百？	As for hundreds of thousands, it briefly mentions a large number, like saying common people, how could it be limited to 100?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a18_9']	萬民亦然。	萬民亦然。	10,000 people is the same.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a18_19']	約位辯瓔，必無價也。	約位辯瓔，必無價也。	In terms of stage, the necklace must be priceless.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a20_10']	所言百千，乃以事數表於理觀，豈專約事定其多少？	所言百千，乃以事數表於理觀，豈專約事定其多少？	What is said about hundreds of thousands is using the number of events to illustrate the contemplation of principle. How can it be exclusively based on events to determine the amount?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a21_4']	頸是所嚴，故表中道，此性德也。	頸是所嚴，故表中道，此性德也。	The neck is what is adorned, so it illustrates the middle way, which is the nature of this virtue.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a21_18']	全性起修，故能嚴行皆無著也。	全性起修，故能嚴行皆無著也。	Fully using the nature to give rise to practice, therefore, the practice of adornment is all non-attachment.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a22_8']	此行稱性，如瓔在頸。	此行稱性，如瓔在頸。	This practice accords with the nature, like a necklace on the neck.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a23_15']	而言解者，菩薩雖有上求下化一切功德，未始不與常捨相應；	而言解者，菩薩雖有上求下化一切功德，未始不與常捨相應；	As for understanding, although bodhisattvas have all the merits of seeking above and transforming below, they have never been unassociated with constant abandonment;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a24_14']	欲示眾生常捨行故，乃解瓔珞而為施也。	欲示眾生常捨行故，乃解瓔珞而為施也。	In order to show sentient beings the practice of constant abandonment, they then untie the necklace and give it as a gift.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a25_4']	《大集》蓋明行瓔嚴理。	《大集》蓋明行瓔嚴理。	The Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra clarifies the adornment of principle with the practice of the adornments.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955a29_4']	一地成萬者，了達一心，十界百法、百界千法、千界萬法，此之萬法性本具足，全性起修轉名萬德，即三學、六度、三昧、總持、神通、智慧、四等、四攝、三念、八脫、十力、無畏，十地悉能分證。	一地成萬者，了達一心，十界百法、百界千法、千界萬法，此之萬法性本具足，全性起修轉名萬德，即三學、六度、三昧、總持、神通、智慧、四等、四攝、三念、八脫、十力、無畏，十地悉能分證。	As for perfecting myriad things in one ground, it means thoroughly understanding the one mind, the ten realms, the hundred dharmas, the hundred realms, the thousand dharmas, and the myriad dharmas of the thousand realms. These myriad dharmas are inherently complete. Turning from inherent nature to cultivation is called the myriad virtues, which are the three learnings, the six perfections, samādhi, dhāraṇī, spiritual powers, wisdom, the four immeasurables, the four means of magnetizing, the three contemplations, the eight liberations, the ten powers, the four forms of fearlessness, and the ten grounds, all of which can be partially realized.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b01_1']	萬德即成十萬，故知言數不專事也。	萬德即成十萬，故知言數不專事也。	The myriad virtues then become ten myriad, so we know that the number of words is not limited to events.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b01_15']	二、「法施」下，釋法施，二：	二、「法施」下，釋法施，二：	Second, below the giving of the Dharma, it explains the giving of the Dharma, in two parts:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b01_23']	初、舊取重法施。	初、舊取重法施。	First, the old interpretation takes the giving of the Dharma to be weighty.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b03_1']	因重聖法故行財施，是則財法分為兩派，理豈然乎？	因重聖法故行財施，是則財法分為兩派，理豈然乎？	Because of the weighty nature of the holy Dharma, one practices the giving of material things. This then divides material things and the Dharma into two streams. How could the principle be so?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b03_9']	二、今明如法施。	二、今明如法施。	Second, the present interpretation clarifies the giving of the Dharma as it is.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b04_12']	法是三諦圓常理性，今體財即性，諸法趣財是趣不過。	法是三諦圓常理性，今體財即性，諸法趣財是趣不過。	The Dharma is the perfect and eternal principle of the three truths. Now, the substance of material things is the nature. All dharmas lead to material things, and this is the ultimate lead.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b05_6']	財尚叵得，云何當有趣與非趣？	財尚叵得，云何當有趣與非趣？	Since wealth is still unattainable, how can there be any good or bad destinies?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b05_15']	故財與法無二無別。	故財與法無二無別。	Therefore, wealth and Dharma are non-dual and non-differentiated.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b06_6']	財外無法、法外無財。	財外無法、法外無財。	There is no Dharma outside of wealth, and no wealth outside of Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b06_11']	豈唯財爾？	豈唯財爾？	How can it be that wealth alone is like this?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b08_3']	施及受者皆空假中無非法界，如是乃名以法界心對法界境起法界施。	施及受者皆空假中無非法界，如是乃名以法界心對法界境起法界施。	Giving, the recipient, and emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way are all without exception the Dharma realm. This is called using the mind of the Dharma realm to face the realm of Dharma as the object and give rise to the giving of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b09_19']	「於財」下，引《淨名經》以一瓔珞分作二分，一分施與最下乞人、一分奉於難勝如來。	「於財」下，引《淨名經》以一瓔珞分作二分，一分施與最下乞人、一分奉於難勝如來。	In terms of wealth, below, the Vimalakīrti Sutra is quoted, dividing a single necklace into two parts, one part given to the lowest beggar, and one part offered to the Tathāgata Difficult to Conquer.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b10_4']	而作是言：	而作是言：	And said:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b12_10']	「若施主等心施一最下乞人，猶如如來福田之相無所分別，等于大悲不求果報，是則名曰具足法施。	「若施主等心施一最下乞人，猶如如來福田之相無所分別，等于大悲不求果報，是則名曰具足法施。	If the donor gives equally to even the lowest beggar, regarding it as the same as the Tathāgata's field of blessings without discrimination, and equally giving rise to great compassion without seeking karmic retribution, this is called being fully endowed with the giving of the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b14_4']	」彼疏釋云「此即觀所施田，入平等法界無有二相，成無緣悲，具足一切佛法。	」彼疏釋云「此即觀所施田，入平等法界無有二相，成無緣悲，具足一切佛法。	The commentary explains: This is precisely observing the field of blessings and entering the equal Dharma realm without two characteristics, accomplishing impartial compassion, and being fully endowed with all Buddha-dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b15_1']	不求緣修之報，即是具足法施之會。	不求緣修之報，即是具足法施之會。	Not seeking rewards for conditioned practices is precisely the complete assembly of the Dharma offering.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b15_20']	」如此明文，諸師何得但約說法以明法施？	」如此明文，諸師何得但約說法以明法施？	How can the various masters only explain the Dharma offering based on the teaching of the Dharma, with such clear texts?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b16_15']	疏文彼經居士觀於悲田，法界等佛。	疏文彼經居士觀於悲田，法界等佛。	The commentary says that in that sutra, the householder observes the field of compassion and the Dharma realm equally with the Buddha.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b18_1']	今無盡意對於敬田，既稱法施，豈不等彼一切眾生邪？	今無盡意對於敬田，既稱法施，豈不等彼一切眾生邪？	Now, in the case of Inexhaustible Intent, he is facing the field of respect. Since it is called the Dharma offering, how could it not be equal to all sentient beings?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b18_14']	二、「不肯」下，不受，二：	二、「不肯」下，不受，二：	Second, unwilling and below is the refusal, with two parts:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b18_19']	初、事釋；	初、事釋；	First, the literal explanation;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b18_24']	二、觀解。	二、觀解。	Second, the contemplation and understanding.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b19_7']	不受三昧，即畢竟空。	不受三昧，即畢竟空。	The samadhi of non-acceptance is precisely the emptiness of the ultimate.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b21_12']	一心三觀破無不遍，以即空故不受於有，以即假故不受於空，以即中故不受二邊，照空假故不受中道。	一心三觀破無不遍，以即空故不受於有，以即假故不受於空，以即中故不受二邊，照空假故不受中道。	The three contemplations in one mind destroy without exception. Because it is empty, it does not accept existence. Because it is provisional, it does not accept emptiness. Because it is the middle, it does not accept the two extremes. Because it illuminates emptiness and the provisional, it does not accept the middle way.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b22_11']	如是不受在一心中，方離次第及以但空。	如是不受在一心中，方離次第及以但空。	Such non-acceptance is in one mind, only then is it free from sequence and mere emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b23_6']	以五不受義遍衍門，應當料簡。	以五不受義遍衍門，應當料簡。	The meaning of the five non-acceptances pervades the teachings of the three vehicles, and should be analyzed.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b23_17']	三、「重白」下，重奉。	三、「重白」下，重奉。	Third, from repeatedly said below, is the second offering.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b24_12']	三義解愍，前二自行、後一利他，此猶事釋。	三義解愍，前二自行、後一利他，此猶事釋。	The three meanings explain compassion, the first two are one's own practice, and the last one benefits others. This is still a literal explanation.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b25_5']	以無等者，復約理觀求觀音受。	以無等者，復約理觀求觀音受。	As for with the unequaled, it further uses principle contemplation to seek Avalokiteśvara's acceptance.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b25_8']	何者？	何者？	What is that?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b26_11']	圓論不受，則於諸法無所遺，故畢竟不受即畢竟受。	圓論不受，則於諸法無所遺，故畢竟不受即畢竟受。	The perfect discussion of non-acceptance is to have nothing left in all dharmas, therefore, ultimate non-acceptance is precisely ultimate acceptance.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b27_4']	故云「以無所受而受諸受」。	故云「以無所受而受諸受」。	Therefore, it says with nothing to accept, one accepts all acceptances.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b27_9']	四、佛勸。	四、佛勸。	Fourth, the Buddha encourages.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b27_14']	五、受施。	五、受施。	Fifth, accepting the offering.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955b28_17']	觀音本地唯佛能知，今現因身須求極果，故雖受施迴奉敬田。	觀音本地唯佛能知，今現因身須求極果，故雖受施迴奉敬田。	Avalokiteśvara's original ground can only be known by the Buddha. Now, the present causal body must seek the ultimate fruit, therefore, although accepting the offering, it is respectfully offered to the field of blessings.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c02_4']	以一瓔珞作二分者，表於一行必具二因，理則正因、事則緣了，事理不二名曰妙因，能成二身不思議果。	以一瓔珞作二分者，表於一行必具二因，理則正因、事則緣了，事理不二名曰妙因，能成二身不思議果。	As for dividing the single necklace into two parts, it illustrates that a single practice must possess two causes. Principle is the correct cause, and phenomena are the conditions and understanding. Phenomena and principle are non-dual, called the wondrous cause, which can accomplish the two bodies and the inconceivable fruit.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c03_3']	法無增減而能出纏，性即修故、報有斷證。	法無增減而能出纏，性即修故、報有斷證。	Dharma has no increase or decrease, yet can emerge from entanglements. Because the nature is precisely cultivation, the retribution has cutting off and realization.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c03_13']	然匪功成，修即性故。	然匪功成，修即性故。	However, without accomplishment, cultivation is based on nature.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c04_10']	若其然者，方曰事理之因趣於法報之果。	若其然者，方曰事理之因趣於法報之果。	If it is so, it is called the cause of phenomena and principle leading to the fruition of Dharma and reward.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c05_7']	不論應身者，因人趣果，合表二身；	不論應身者，因人趣果，合表二身；	Not discussing the reward body, the person of cause leads to the fruition, combining to represent the two bodies;
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c05_17']	法報若成，應用自發。	法報若成，應用自發。	If the Dharma and reward are accomplished, the application naturally arises.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c05_22']	六、結德。	六、結德。	Sixth, concluding the virtues.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c06_18']	文後重頌，什公不譯，諸師皆謂梵本中有。	文後重頌，什公不譯，諸師皆謂梵本中有。	The text later has a repeated verse, which Master Kumārajīva did not translate. All the masters say it exists in the Sanskrit text.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c07_2']	荊谿云：	荊谿云：	Jingxi says:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c07_12']	「此亦未測什公深意。	「此亦未測什公深意。	This also does not fathom Master Kumārajīva's profound intention.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c09_1']	」《續高僧傳》云「偈是闍那崛多所譯」，智者出時此偈未行，故無所解。	」《續高僧傳》云「偈是闍那崛多所譯」，智者出時此偈未行，故無所解。	The Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks say the verse was translated by Jñānagupta. When Zhizhe was alive, this verse had not yet circulated, so there was no explanation.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c10_8']	荊谿亦於《輔行記》中，引還著於本人之文，故知具釋理亦無妨。	荊谿亦於《輔行記》中，引還著於本人之文，故知具釋理亦無妨。	Jingxi also quotes the text it still attaches to the original person in the Supplementary Explanations. Therefore, we know that it is also unobstructed to fully explain the principle.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c12_6']	近有天竺寺式法師，分節其文對於長行，二種問答宛如符契，今依彼科略消此偈。	近有天竺寺式法師，分節其文對於長行，二種問答宛如符契，今依彼科略消此偈。	Recently, Dharma Master Shi of Tianzhu Temple divided the text and matched it with the prose, and the two kinds of questions and answers were like a matching tally. Now, following his outline, I will briefly explain this verse.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c12_16']	偈有二十六行，分三：	偈有二十六行，分三：	The verse has twenty-six lines, divided into three parts:

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c16_12']	長行先問得名因緣，次問三業遊化之相。	長行先問得名因緣，次問三業遊化之相。	The prose first asks about the causes and conditions of obtaining the name, and then asks about the appearance of roaming and transforming through the three karmas.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c17_2']	今既重頌，豈闕後問？	今既重頌，豈闕後問？	Now that it is being chanted again, how could the latter question be omitted?
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c17_16', 'ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c18_13']	故知句中問彼兩字兼含次問也。🔽二、「佛子」下兩句，別頌初問，文甚顯著。	故知句中問彼兩字兼含次問也。 二、「佛子」下兩句，別頌初問，文甚顯著。	Therefore, it should be known that the word them in the line also contains the subsequent question.🔽The two lines beginning with Buddha's disciples are a separate praise of the first question, the text is very clear.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c19_8']	二、「具足」下二十二行雙頌二答，二：	二、「具足」下二十二行雙頌二答，二：	Second, the twenty-two lines beginning with fully endowed jointly praise the two answers, divided into two parts:
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c20_4']	初二句經家敘緝綴之語，合當直說。	初二句經家敘緝綴之語，合當直說。	The first two lines are the compiler's words of stitching and mending, which should be directly spoken.

['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c23_18']	觀音行者，一心三智觀彼類音。	觀音行者，一心三智觀彼類音。	The practice of Avalokitesvara is to contemplate the various sounds with the three knowledges in one mind.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c24_16']	令無量苦一時解脫，即是已成利他行也。	令無量苦一時解脫，即是已成利他行也。	Causing immeasurable suffering to be liberated at once is precisely the already accomplished practice of benefiting others.
['ZH_T34_1729_004:0955c25_11']	不動真心垂形三土，方名善應。	不動真心垂形三土，方名善應。	The unmoving true mind manifests in the three lands, which is then called good response.
