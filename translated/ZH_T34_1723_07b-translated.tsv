['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b16_0']	三門分別：一來意，二釋名，三解妨。來	三門分別：一來意，二釋名，三解妨。來	07b	Three aspects of analysis: First, the reason for the chapter; second, explaining the name; third, resolving doubts. The reason
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b17_3']	意有四：	意有四：	07b	for the chapter has four points:
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b19_9']	一者上中根類聞法得記，下根之徒猶未明解，故陳過去已結大乘之緣，并說現在小果化城之喻。	一者上中根類聞法得記，下根之徒猶未明解，故陳過去已結大乘之緣，并說現在小果化城之喻。	07b	First, those of middling and superior faculties heard the Dharma and received predictions, but those of inferior faculties still did not understand clearly, so the past causes and conditions for forming the Mahāyāna were explained, along with the parable of the provisional city of the lesser fruit in the present.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b21_4']	陳往因令其證實，述今果令其捨權，遣生覺解方可為記，故此品來。	陳往因令其證實，述今果令其捨權，遣生覺解方可為記，故此品來。	07b	The past causes and conditions were explained to enable them to realize the truth, and the present fruits were recounted to enable them to abandon the provisional, dispelling their doubts and enabling them to receive predictions, thus this chapter is given.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b24_17']	二者論解為對治七種具足煩惱性眾生，有七種增上慢中第四有定人，實無而有增上慢，以有世間三昧三摩跋提，實無涅槃而生涅槃想，對治此故說化城喻。	二者論解為對治七種具足煩惱性眾生，有七種增上慢中第四有定人，實無而有增上慢，以有世間三昧三摩跋提，實無涅槃而生涅槃想，對治此故說化城喻。	07b	Second, the treatise explains that in order to counteract the seven kinds of sentient beings with complete afflictions, among the seven kinds of overweening pride, the fourth is one who has a fixed nature but actually has overweening pride without it, who has worldly samādhi and samāpatti, but actually has no nirvāṇa and gives rise to the notion of nirvāṇa. In order to counteract this, the parable of the provisional city is given.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b25_15']	又云第四人者，方便令入涅槃城故。	又云第四人者，方便令入涅槃城故。	07b	It also says that the fourth person is enabled to enter the city of nirvāṇa through skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b26_7']	涅槃城者，諸禪三昧城。	涅槃城者，諸禪三昧城。	07b	The city of nirvana refers to the city of various dhyana concentrations.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b26_19']	過彼城已，令入大涅槃城。	過彼城已，令入大涅槃城。	07b	After passing through that city, it causes one to enter the great city of nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b28_7']	故有定人者，彼已得定諸有學凡夫人，今說往事令憶念故。	故有定人者，彼已得定諸有學凡夫人，今說往事令憶念故。	07b	Therefore, those who have attained concentration refer to those who have already attained concentration, all learners and ordinary beings, now speaking of past events to cause them to recollect.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789b29_5']	此所起慢，或欲界分別、或上界煩惱。	此所起慢，或欲界分別、或上界煩惱。	07b	The pride that arises from this may be either the discrimination of the desire realm or the afflictions of the upper realms.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c02_11']	三昧城者，謂有學凡夫專心所求，在無學身盡無生智後，世間禪定所變解脫離能變無，總名三昧。	三昧城者，謂有學凡夫專心所求，在無學身盡無生智後，世間禪定所變解脫離能變無，總名三昧。	07b	The city of samadhi refers to the single-minded pursuit of learners and ordinary beings. After the knowledge of exhaustion and non-arising in the body of the post-learner, the worldly dhyana concentrations transform into liberation, free from the ability to transform. In total, it is called samadhi.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c03_2']	此定有漏，名為世間。	此定有漏，名為世間。	07b	This concentration is contaminated, and is called worldly.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c05_3']	此中意說，佛說三事名大般涅槃，三乘同得擇滅解脫，即是無學解脫道中所證生空理。	此中意說，佛說三事名大般涅槃，三乘同得擇滅解脫，即是無學解脫道中所證生空理。	07b	The meaning here is explained as follows: the Buddha speaks of the three matters called the great parinirvana, which are attained equally by the three vehicles. The liberation realized in the path of liberation of the post-learner is precisely the principle of emptiness of self-nature realized in the path of liberation of the post-learner.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c05_17']	由此後時惑苦不生，名為解脫。	由此後時惑苦不生，名為解脫。	07b	Because of this, afflictions and suffering do not arise later, which is called liberation.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c06_8']	佛說此解脫名為化城。	佛說此解脫名為化城。	07b	The Buddha speaks of this liberation as a transformed city.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c08_8']	生空智證名為暫入，以息眾苦故言方便入涅槃城，後引至寶所方至大涅槃城。	生空智證名為暫入，以息眾苦故言方便入涅槃城，後引至寶所方至大涅槃城。	07b	The cognition of the emptiness of beings is provisionally called entry, because it puts an end to suffering. It is said that one provisionally enters the city of nirvana, and later one is led to the place of treasure, which is the great city of nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c10_7']	二乘之人加行智求變作此相，至於無學解脫道中正證解脫，都無分別種種之想。	二乘之人加行智求變作此相，至於無學解脫道中正證解脫，都無分別種種之想。	07b	The two vehicles seek to transform this appearance through the cognition of added effort, and when they reach the path of liberation in the stage of post-learner, they directly realize liberation, completely without various discriminating thoughts.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c13_6']	出解脫道後，世間定心重緣所得，以心麁故不知真智所證之法，但見加行所求涅槃解脫相狀便謂涅槃，謂有實滅。	出解脫道後，世間定心重緣所得，以心麁故不知真智所證之法，但見加行所求涅槃解脫相狀便謂涅槃，謂有實滅。	07b	After emerging from the path of liberation, the worldly concentrated mind again takes as its object what was attained. Because the mind is coarse, it does not know the Dharma realized by true cognition, but only sees the appearance of nirvana and liberation sought by added effort and takes it to be nirvana, thinking it is a real cessation.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c14_15']	豈非彼解是世間定，故言以有世間三昧，實無涅槃而生涅槃想。	豈非彼解是世間定，故言以有世間三昧，實無涅槃而生涅槃想。	07b	How could it not be that their understanding is worldly concentration? Therefore it is said that because of having worldly samādhi, there is really no nirvana but one gives rise to the idea of nirvana.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c16_8']	凡夫有學聞此假解，不識知故，謂有實涅槃，起堅執心作意欣趣。	凡夫有學聞此假解，不識知故，謂有實涅槃，起堅執心作意欣趣。	07b	Ordinary beings and learners hear this provisional understanding but do not recognize it, so they think there is a real nirvana and give rise to a mind of firm attachment and intention to pursue it.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c18_5']	故今破之，說彼所證猶如化城，尚為不實、不應趣求，況在無學假所變耶。	故今破之，說彼所證猶如化城，尚為不實、不應趣求，況在無學假所變耶。	07b	Therefore, now we refute it, saying that what they realize is like a phantom city, which is still unreal and should not be pursued, let alone that which is transformed by those in the stage of no-more-learning.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c21_2']	如二乘人所起四倒正智證生空猶未起執，後時觀前正智行相不親得故，乃見加行所求行相，便謂為真遂起四倒。	如二乘人所起四倒正智證生空猶未起執，後時觀前正智行相不親得故，乃見加行所求行相，便謂為真遂起四倒。	07b	Just as the two vehicles give rise to the four inversions, their correct knowledge realizing the emptiness of beings has not yet given rise to attachment. Later, when they contemplate the characteristics of their previous correct knowledge, because they do not directly realize them, they see the characteristics they sought through added effort and take them to be true, thus giving rise to the four inversions.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c22_11']	此亦如是，非無漏心及世間定皆是法執，出彼心後方起執故。	此亦如是，非無漏心及世間定皆是法執，出彼心後方起執故。	07b	This is also like that. Not all minds of the stage of no-outflows and worldly concentrations are all with the grasping of dharmas, because attachment arises only after those minds have ceased.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c22_16']	此護法義。	此護法義。	07b	This is the meaning of the master Dharmapāla.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c24_18']	若安慧師，即無學位解脫道等諸無漏心、世間定心，皆有法執，所證擇滅名為化城。	若安慧師，即無學位解脫道等諸無漏心、世間定心，皆有法執，所證擇滅名為化城。	07b	If the master Sthiramati is correct, then the minds of no-outflows such as the path of liberation in the stage of no-more-learning, and the minds of worldly concentrations, all have the grasping of dharmas, and the cessation realized by them is called a phantom city.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c25_9']	餘人求之，理增上慢。	餘人求之，理增上慢。	07b	Other people seek it, and it is a form of excessive pride.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c26_8']	論說具足煩惱性眾生所起，故非無學。	論說具足煩惱性眾生所起，故非無學。	07b	The treatise says that it is given rise to by beings with the nature of complete afflictions, so it is not in the stage of no-more-learning.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c27_11']	又有釋言，此是世間凡夫所執所得世間三摩󰍑提；	又有釋言，此是世間凡夫所執所得世間三摩󰍑提；	07b	Another interpretation says that this is the worldly samādhi attained by worldly ordinary beings;
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0789c28_6']	六行所得假非擇滅謂真涅槃。	六行所得假非擇滅謂真涅槃。	07b	The provisional non-analytical cessation attained through the six practices is called true nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a01_9']	佛說二乘無學所得擇滅涅槃方便令入，猶如化城，中路息苦、擬向寶所，尚非真滅，況汝凡夫所得世間假解三昧，執實滅耶？	佛說二乘無學所得擇滅涅槃方便令入，猶如化城，中路息苦、擬向寶所，尚非真滅，況汝凡夫所得世間假解三昧，執實滅耶？	07b	The Buddha taught that the cessation nirvāṇa attained by the post-learners of the two vehicles is a skillful means, like a phantom city, a temporary respite from suffering on the way, intended to lead them to the treasure-site of nirvāṇa. It is still not true cessation, let alone the worldly samādhi attained by ordinary beings, which you cling to as true cessation.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a02_4']	有學之人不起此執，凡夫有故。	有學之人不起此執，凡夫有故。	07b	Learned people do not give rise to this clinging, but ordinary beings do.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a04_14']	下言導師知無疲倦即滅化城，云向者大城是我化作，說化滅化破執二乘涅槃實城，為滅凡夫所執城故。	下言導師知無疲倦即滅化城，云向者大城是我化作，說化滅化破執二乘涅槃實城，為滅凡夫所執城故。	07b	The text below says that the guide, knowing that they were not tired, immediately destroyed the phantom city, saying, The great city I created earlier is now destroyed. This is to destroy the clinging to the cessation nirvāṇa of the two vehicles as a real city, in order to destroy the ordinary beings' clinging to the city.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a05_5']	此中應如護法等解。	此中應如護法等解。	07b	Here, one should understand it as explained by Dharmapāla and others.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a06_13']	三者十無上中第二示現行無上，故說大通智勝如來本事。	三者十無上中第二示現行無上，故說大通智勝如來本事。	07b	Third, among the ten supremes, the second is the supreme manifestation of practice, therefore it explains the main story of Tathāgata Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a09_2']	大乘菩提難得、行亦難成，非如二乘菩提疾得、行亦易修，故說大通智勝佛十劫坐道場方得菩提事。	大乘菩提難得、行亦難成，非如二乘菩提疾得、行亦易修，故說大通智勝佛十劫坐道場方得菩提事。	07b	The enlightenment of the Great Vehicle is difficult to attain and its practice is also difficult to accomplish, unlike the enlightenment of the Two Vehicles which is quickly attained and its practice is also easy to cultivate. Therefore, it is said that Buddha Vipaśyin sat in the Way-place for ten kalpas before finally attaining enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a09_12']	此為文殘，說古事故。	此為文殘，說古事故。	07b	This is a textual remnant, speaking of ancient events.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a11_4']	或說大通佛事者，說佛自身彼時修行為十六王子，今始得菩提。	或說大通佛事者，說佛自身彼時修行為十六王子，今始得菩提。	07b	Or, speaking of the events of Buddha Vipaśyin means speaking of the Buddha himself cultivating practices at that time as the sixteen princes, and only now finally attaining enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a11_18']	又諸聲聞彼時發心，今時方熟。	又諸聲聞彼時發心，今時方熟。	07b	Moreover, the various śrāvakas aroused the aspiration for enlightenment at that time, and now it is finally ripening.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a13_4']	故大因行非卒修成，名行無上，不說大通佛之行也。	故大因行非卒修成，名行無上，不說大通佛之行也。	07b	Therefore, the great causal practices are not suddenly cultivated and accomplished, and are called unsurpassed in practice, not speaking of the practices of Buddha Vipaśyin.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a14_17', 'ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a16_2']	即將說今，要先說古，雖以今果為品號，其因亦在其中明，故此品來。🔽四者十無上中第三示現增長力無上，故說商主喻。	即將說今，要先說古，雖以今果為品號，其因亦在其中明，故此品來。🔽四者十無上中第三示現增長力無上，故說商主喻。	07b	Just about to speak of the present, it is necessary to first speak of the past. Although using the present fruition as the chapter title, its causes are also explained within it, and therefore this chapter comes.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a18_3']	前說化城知非真滅，未說商主能長商人能引至於佛果寶所，今此說之，故此品來。	前說化城知非真滅，未說商主能長商人能引至於佛果寶所，今此說之，故此品來。	07b	Previously, it was explained that the illusory city is not a true cessation, but it did not explain how the caravan leader can lead the merchants to the treasure of Buddha-hood. This is now explained, so this chapter comes.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a18_13']	此乃義殘，非文殘也。	此乃義殘，非文殘也。	07b	This is a remainder of meaning, not a remainder of text.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a19_14']	釋名者，禦寇安神之所曰城，本無而有曰化。	釋名者，禦寇安神之所曰城，本無而有曰化。	07b	As for explaining the name, a city is a place where one can rest and find peace, originally non-existent but now existing, called illusory.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a21_1']	禦寇者息生死之疲，安神者證恬寂之樂，故喻於城。	禦寇者息生死之疲，安神者證恬寂之樂，故喻於城。	07b	Resting in the city means to cease the fatigue of birth and death, and finding peace means to experience the joy of tranquility and silence, thus it is likened to a city.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a22_1']	佛假權施，名之為化，城即是化，名曰化城。	佛假權施，名之為化，城即是化，名曰化城。	07b	The Buddha provisionally bestows it, calling it illusory, the city itself is illusory, called an illusory city.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a22_18']	今是喻、法，此品廣明，名化城喻品。	今是喻、法，此品廣明，名化城喻品。	07b	Now it is both a metaphor and the Dharma, this chapter extensively clarifies it, called the Chapter on the Metaphor of the Illusory City.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a23_2']	解妨難者。	解妨難者。	07b	As for resolving difficulties.

['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a23_13']	此品所明乃有二義：	此品所明乃有二義：	07b	What is clarified in this chapter has two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a24_4']	一大通往事，即行無上；	一大通往事，即行無上；	07b	The first is the great universal past event, which is the unsurpassed practice;
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a24_18']	二說化城今事，即增長力無上。	二說化城今事，即增長力無上。	07b	The second is explaining the present event of the illusory city, which is the unsurpassed increase of power.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a25_14']	何故唯以化城為名，不以佛事為目？	何故唯以化城為名，不以佛事為目？	07b	Why is it only named after the illusory city and not after the Buddha's work?
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a25_16']	答：	答：	07b	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790a29_2']	正教之說本除生病，生有本無而有增上慢，執非擇滅為真，今說擇滅為化除之，令捨漸進寶所，故以化城為品、不以佛事為品。	正教之說本除生病，生有本無而有增上慢，執非擇滅為真，今說擇滅為化除之，令捨漸進寶所，故以化城為品、不以佛事為品。	07b	The teachings of the true Dharma originally eliminate the sickness of birth. Birth is originally non-existent, yet there are those with excessive pride who grasp non-analytical cessation as true. Now, it is taught that analytical cessation is for the sake of transforming and eliminating this, causing them to abandon it and gradually advance to the treasure site. Therefore, the chapter is called The City of the Transformation and not The Buddha's Affairs.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b02_5']	《正法華》名「往古品」，謂顯過去佛曾教化發大乘種，令其憶念為今熟因，望其意解引入大乘非正破病，故今此經不以往古為品號。	《正法華》名「往古品」，謂顯過去佛曾教化發大乘種，令其憶念為今熟因，望其意解引入大乘非正破病，故今此經不以往古為品號。	07b	The Saṃghadeva's Correct Dharma Flower Sutra is named The Chapter on the Past, referring to the fact that the Buddhas of the past once taught and transformed, planting the seeds of the Great Vehicle, causing them to remember it as the cause for present maturity. It is hoped that by understanding their intentions, they will be led into the Great Vehicle. It does not directly eliminate sickness, so this sutra does not take the past as the chapter title.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b04_4']	又化城果今現得，大通事在往因，以顯果為品名，不以隱因為品稱，亦無失也。	又化城果今現得，大通事在往因，以顯果為品名，不以隱因為品稱，亦無失也。	07b	Moreover, the fruition of the city of the transformation is presently attained, while the affairs of the Great通 are in the past causes. Taking the manifest fruition as the chapter name, not taking the hidden causes as the chapter title, is also not a mistake.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b05_13']	經「佛告諸比丘至阿僧祇劫」。	經「佛告諸比丘至阿僧祇劫」。	07b	The sutra says: The Buddha told the bhikshus... up to ...innumerable eons.

In the beginning of the second chapter, Subhūti understands. In the third chapter, after the understanding, it says, At that time the Buddha told the bhikṣus, 'You have seen this... and so on, where the Buddha reiterates. In the fourth chapter, The bhikṣus, Subhūti will also... and so on, a prophecy is made for him.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b10_14']	初文有二：	初文有二：	07b	The first text has two parts:
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b13_4']	初說宿因令念退大以就小，後「諸比丘若如來自知涅槃時到眾又清淨」下，顯今果令知捨權以取實。	初說宿因令念退大以就小，後「諸比丘若如來自知涅槃時到眾又清淨」下，顯今果令知捨權以取實。	07b	First, speaking of past causes, causing them to remember abandoning the great and turning to the small. Later, The bhikṣus, when the Tathāgata knows the time for nirvāṇa has come and the assembly is pure... and so on, revealing the present fruition, causing them to know abandoning the provisional and taking up the real.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b15_2']	初是說古因緣，令自了達往修大因退住小果，論名行無上說大通如來本事。	初是說古因緣，令自了達往修大因退住小果，論名行無上說大通如來本事。	07b	The first is speaking of past causes and conditions, causing them to understand themselves, having cultivated great causes in the past, and regressing to abide in the fruition of the small vehicle. In the treatise, it is called practicing the unsurpassed, speaking of the past of Mahāsaṃbuddha Tathāgata.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b17_4']	後是述今得果，論名為破有定人實無而有增上慢，又為示現增長力無上故說商主喻。	後是述今得果，論名為破有定人實無而有增上慢，又為示現增長力無上故說商主喻。	07b	The second is expounding the attainment of fruition in the present. In the treatise, it is called destroying those with fixed views, who in reality do not have [attainment] but have a sense of superiority. It is also to manifest the unsurpassed power of increase, thus speaking the parable of the caravan leader.
['ZH_T34_1723_07b:0790b17_16']	說初發大心，令今取大果；	說初發大心，令今取大果；	07b	Speaking of first giving rise to the great mind, causing them to now attain the great fruit;
