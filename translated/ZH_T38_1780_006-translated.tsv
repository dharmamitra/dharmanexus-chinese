['ZH_T38_1780_006:0890c25_0', 'ZH_T38_1780_006:0890c26_1']	略明四句：一境智俱常。唯大乘有之，小乘無🔽也。	略明四句：一境智俱常。唯大乘有之，小乘無 也。	006	Briefly explaining four statements: First, object and wisdom are both permanent. Only the Mahayana has this, the Hinayana does not have it.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0890c26_13']	以小乘凡聖之智皆無常故。	以小乘凡聖之智皆無常故。	006	Because the wisdom of ordinary beings and sages in the Hinayana is all impermanent.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0890c28_8']	一常智照實相境，如果法觀照般若照實相般若。	一常智照實相境，如果法觀照般若照實相般若。	006	First, permanent wisdom illuminates the true nature of reality, like the contemplation of the Dharma of the perfection of wisdom illuminating the perfection of wisdom of true reality.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0890c29_16']	二常智照虛空常境，如《大經》云「一切常中，虛空第一」。	二常智照虛空常境，如《大經》云「一切常中，虛空第一」。	006	Second, permanent wisdom illuminates the permanently real object, like the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, Among all that is permanent, space is the foremost.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a01_2']	今常智照此常境也。	今常智照此常境也。	006	Now, permanent wisdom illuminates this permanent object.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a02_20']	若以實相即是虛空，如《釋論》中說虛空論非有非無，言語道斷、心行處滅，即是實相。	若以實相即是虛空，如《釋論》中說虛空論非有非無，言語道斷、心行處滅，即是實相。	006	If the true nature of reality is precisely space, as the Śāstra says, space is neither existent nor nonexistent, beyond words and thoughts, which is precisely the true nature of reality.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a03_11']	今且據事辨，以虛空為常。	今且據事辨，以虛空為常。	006	Now, based on phenomena, space is considered permanent.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a18_10']	須詳此說意，為以證真如之智為法身耶、為取所證真如佛性為法身耶？	須詳此說意，為以證真如之智為法身耶、為取所證真如佛性為法身耶？	006	It is necessary to carefully examine the meaning of this statement. Is it that the wisdom that realizes true suchness is taken as the Dharma body, or is it that the realized true suchness Buddha-nature is taken as the Dharma body?
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a19_9']	若以能證之智為法身常者，是事不然。	若以能證之智為法身常者，是事不然。	006	If the wisdom of realization is taken as the eternally abiding Dharma body, this is not so.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a20_12']	《釋論》云「在菩薩心名為般若，在佛心變名薩般若」。	《釋論》云「在菩薩心名為般若，在佛心變名薩般若」。	006	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says: In the mind of the bodhisattva, it is called prajñā; in the mind of the Buddha, it transforms and is called sarvajña.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a21_8']	是常者則無明昧，不應有改變也。	是常者則無明昧，不應有改變也。	006	That which is eternal is without obscurity and clarity, and should not have any transformation.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a24_11']	〈長壽品〉凡簡三法常義，一者外道、二者小乘、三者菩薩，並無常住，故知常義唯在佛果，因中未有現顯之常。	〈長壽品〉凡簡三法常義，一者外道、二者小乘、三者菩薩，並無常住，故知常義唯在佛果，因中未有現顯之常。	006	In the chapter on longevity, three kinds of permanence are generally distinguished: first, non-Buddhist teachings, second, the Lesser Vehicle, and third, bodhisattvas. All are impermanent, so it is known that the meaning of permanence is only in the fruition of Buddhahood, and it is not present and evident in the causal stage.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a26_4']	若以所證真如佛性為常者，則一切眾生皆有此事，何止初地以上耶？	若以所證真如佛性為常者，則一切眾生皆有此事，何止初地以上耶？	006	If the true suchness and Buddha-nature that is realized is taken as permanent, then all sentient beings have this matter. How is it limited to those above the first ground?
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891a28_3']	若言初地以上即見佛性，故以佛性常為法身者，此猶是江南舊宗，非北異說此。	若言初地以上即見佛性，故以佛性常為法身者，此猶是江南舊宗，非北異說此。	006	If it is said that those above the first ground see the Buddha-nature, and therefore take the Buddha-nature's permanence as the Dharma body, this is still the old school of the south of the Yangtze River, not the different teachings of the north.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b02_10']	既其改變，則知有明昧不同。	既其改變，則知有明昧不同。	006	Since it has changed, it is known that there is a difference in clarity and obscurity.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b04_17']	又本以見真故斷惑，初地見真與佛不異，則一切惑斷。	又本以見真故斷惑，初地見真與佛不異，則一切惑斷。	006	Moreover, since one originally cuts off afflictions by seeing the truth, the seeing of the truth in the first ground is no different from that of the Buddha, so all afflictions are cut off.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b05_15']	若不以見真斷惑，即便應是有智斷惑。	若不以見真斷惑，即便應是有智斷惑。	006	If one does not cut off afflictions by seeing the truth, then one would have wisdom and cut off afflictions at the same time.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b15_16']	今明此是無分別中善巧分別不二二義，故開常無常境智二義耳。	今明此是無分別中善巧分別不二二義，故開常無常境智二義耳。	006	Now, it is explained that this is skillful discrimination within non-discrimination, discriminating the meaning of non-duality and duality, and thus revealing the two meanings of the realm and wisdom of permanence and impermanence.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b16_10']	既云不二二，即知雖二不二。	既云不二二，即知雖二不二。	006	Since it is said to be non-dual and dual, one should know that although dual, it is non-dual.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b17_10']	如《大經》云「我無我無有二相，常無常亦示」。	如《大經》云「我無我無有二相，常無常亦示」。	006	As the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: Self and non-self have no two characteristics, permanence and impermanence are also shown.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b18_8']	經云「愚者謂二，智者了達，知其無二」。	經云「愚者謂二，智者了達，知其無二」。	006	The sūtra says: The foolish consider them dual, while the wise understand and know that they are non-dual.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b19_8']	何者？	何者？	006	Why is it so?
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b20_13']	愚人不識常無常、不知境智，故是無明，無明故名為愚。	愚人不識常無常、不知境智，故是無明，無明故名為愚。	006	Fools do not recognize the permanent and impermanent, and do not know the objects and wisdom, therefore it is ignorance, and because of ignorance they are called foolish.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b21_6']	智人了知常無常，名為智者。	智人了知常無常，名為智者。	006	The wise ones understand the permanent and impermanent, and are called the wise ones.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b21_16']	是故名為語同意異也。	是故名為語同意異也。	006	Therefore it is called the same meaning with different words.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b23_7']	有所得人不善分別，無所得人善能分別，故名語異。	有所得人不善分別，無所得人善能分別，故名語異。	006	People with attainment do not skillfully discriminate, while people without attainment skillfully discriminate, therefore it is called different words.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b24_14']	一是無所得心善分別、二者有所得心不善分別，故名意異也。	一是無所得心善分別、二者有所得心不善分別，故名意異也。	006	One is the mind without attainment skillfully discriminating, and two is the mind with attainment not skillfully discriminating, therefore it is called different meanings.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b26_17']	三者語同意同者，語與諸佛菩薩方等經論則同，意與諸佛菩薩無依正觀亦同，故名語同意同。	三者語同意同者，語與諸佛菩薩方等經論則同，意與諸佛菩薩無依正觀亦同，故名語同意同。	006	Third, the same words with the same meaning, the words are the same as the Mahāyāna sūtras and treatises of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the meaning is the same as the non-abiding correct contemplation of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, therefore it is called the same words with the same meaning.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891b28_13']	又語與有所得人同，有所得人復有小分得處，今意亦與彼同，故云語同意同。	又語與有所得人同，有所得人復有小分得處，今意亦與彼同，故云語同意同。	006	Moreover, the words are the same as those with attainment, and those with attainment also have a small part of attainment, now the meaning is also the same as theirs, therefore it is said the same words with the same meaning.

['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891c03_5']	答：	答：	006	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891c04_11']	有二種人，一始學大乘，謂必須一向與舊宗為異，則成謗法。	有二種人，一始學大乘，謂必須一向與舊宗為異，則成謗法。	006	There are two kinds of people: First, those who newly study the Mahāyāna, who think that it must be completely different from the old school, and thus slander the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891c05_6']	所以然者，語出經論，宜共用之。	所以然者，語出經論，宜共用之。	006	The reason for this is that the words come from the sūtras and treatises, and should be used together.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891c06_7']	但得與無得，其心各別，不應以意異故今語亦異。	但得與無得，其心各別，不應以意異故今語亦異。	006	It is only that the mind of attainment and non-attainment is different, and one should not make the words different now because the meaning is different.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891c07_10']	二者學小乘人，云小與大異，強謂義同是亦謗法。	二者學小乘人，云小與大異，強謂義同是亦謗法。	006	Second, those who study the Hīnayāna say that the Hīnayāna is different from the Mahāyāna, and insist that the meanings are the same, which is also slandering the Dharma.
['ZH_T38_1780_006:0891c09_19']	所以然者，小乘語意與大乘語意其實不同，而強謂同，如學《成實論》者，無相滅諦與方等理均，亦名謗法也。	所以然者，小乘語意與大乘語意其實不同，而強謂同，如學《成實論》者，無相滅諦與方等理均，亦名謗法也。	006	The reason is that the meaning of the words of the Lesser Vehicle is actually different from the meaning of the words of the Great Vehicle, yet they insist on saying they are the same. It is like those who study the Satyasiddhi Śāstra, whose signless cessation truth is the same as the principle of the Vaipulya, yet they also slander the Dharma.

Provisional existence cannot be said to be existent, provisional existence cannot be said to be nonexistent, provisional existence cannot be said to be both existent and nonexistent, and provisional existence cannot be said to be neither existent nor nonexistent.
