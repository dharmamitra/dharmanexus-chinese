['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a07_11']	稽首唯識性，滿分清淨者。	稽首唯識性，滿分清淨者。	001	I bow to the nature of consciousness-only, the perfected and complete purifiers.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a08_4']	我今釋彼說，利樂諸有情。	我今釋彼說，利樂諸有情。	001	I will now explain what they have said, for the benefit and joy of all beings.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a09_4']	今造此論，為於二空有迷謬者生正解故。	今造此論，為於二空有迷謬者生正解故。	001	The present treatise is composed in order to generate correct understanding for those who are confused or mistaken about the two kinds of emptiness.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a10_14']	生解為斷二重障故，由我法執二障具生，若證二空彼障隨斷。	生解為斷二重障故，由我法執二障具生，若證二空彼障隨斷。	001	Understanding is generated in order to sever the two kinds of heavy obstructions, because when the two kinds of grasping at self and dharmas are present, the two obstructions arise together. If one realizes the two kinds of emptiness, those obstructions will be severed accordingly.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a12_15']	斷障為得二勝果故，由斷續生煩惱障故證真解脫，由斷礙解所知障故得大菩提。	斷障為得二勝果故，由斷續生煩惱障故證真解脫，由斷礙解所知障故得大菩提。	001	Severing the obstructions is for the sake of attaining the two supreme fruits. By severing the afflictive obstructions that perpetuate birth and death, one realizes true liberation. By severing the obstructions to the knowable that hinder understanding, one attains great enlightenment.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a14_7']	又為開示謬執我法迷唯識者，令達二空，於唯識理如實知故。	又為開示謬執我法迷唯識者，令達二空，於唯識理如實知故。	001	Moreover, it is in order to reveal and instruct those who mistakenly grasp at self and dharmas and are confused about consciousness-only, causing them to penetrate the two kinds of emptiness and correctly understand the principle of consciousness-only.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a18_8']	復有迷謬唯識理者，或執外境如識非無、或執內識如境非有、或執諸識用別體同、或執離心無別心所，為遮此等種種異執，令於唯識深妙理中得如實解，故作斯論。	復有迷謬唯識理者，或執外境如識非無、或執內識如境非有、或執諸識用別體同、或執離心無別心所，為遮此等種種異執，令於唯識深妙理中得如實解，故作斯論。	001	There are also those who are confused about the principle of consciousness only, who either grasp external objects as not nonexistent like consciousness, or grasp internal consciousness as not existent like objects, or grasp the various consciousnesses as having different functions but the same substance, or grasp that apart from mind there are no separate mental factors. In order to refute these various heterodox views and enable one to attain correct understanding of the profound principle of consciousness only, this treatise is composed.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a19_7']	若唯有識，云何世間及諸聖教說有我法？	若唯有識，云何世間及諸聖教說有我法？	001	If there is only consciousness, how do the world and the holy teachings speak of the existence of self and dharmas?

['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a21_0']	彼依識所變，　　此能變唯三，	彼依識所變，　　此能變唯三，	001	They are based on the transformation of consciousness. This transforming [consciousness] is only three:
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a22_14']	２謂異熟思量，　　及了別境識。	２謂異熟思量，　　及了別境識。	001	The store consciousness, manas, and the six consciousnesses, which perceive objects.

['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a24_2']	世間聖教說有我法，但由假立，非實有性。	世間聖教說有我法，但由假立，非實有性。	001	The world and the holy teachings speak of the existence of self and dharmas, but this is only a provisional designation, not their real nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a25_1']	我謂主宰，法謂軌持，彼二俱有種種相轉。	我謂主宰，法謂軌持，彼二俱有種種相轉。	001	Self refers to the master and controller, and dharmas refer to the guiding principles and upheld phenomena. Both of them have various aspects of transformation.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a25_19']	我種種相，謂有情命者等、預流一來等。	我種種相，謂有情命者等、預流一來等。	001	The various aspects of self refer to sentient beings, living beings, etc., and stream-enterers, once-returners, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a26_14']	法種種相，謂實德業等、蘊處界等。	法種種相，謂實德業等、蘊處界等。	001	The various characteristics of dharmas are such things as reality, virtue, action, etc., and such things as aggregates, sense bases, and sense fields.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a27_3']	轉謂隨緣施設有異。	轉謂隨緣施設有異。	001	Transformation means that there are differences in designation in accordance with conditions.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a27_17']	如是諸相若由假說，依何得成？	如是諸相若由假說，依何得成？	001	If these characteristics are due to provisional designation, on what basis are they established?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a28_11']	彼相皆依識所轉變而假施設。	彼相皆依識所轉變而假施設。	001	These characteristics are all provisionally established on the basis of the transformation of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001a29_11']	識謂了別，此中識言亦攝心所，定相應故。	識謂了別，此中識言亦攝心所，定相應故。	001	Consciousness means discrimination. The word consciousness here also includes mental activities, because they are definitely associated.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b01_11']	變謂識體轉似二分，相、見俱依自證起故。	變謂識體轉似二分，相、見俱依自證起故。	001	Transformation means that the substance of consciousness transforms into the appearance of two parts, because the seen and seeing parts both arise on the basis of self-awareness.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b02_10']	依斯二分施設我法，彼二離此無所依故。	依斯二分施設我法，彼二離此無所依故。	001	On the basis of these two parts, self and dharmas are provisionally established, because apart from them, they have no basis.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b04_17']	或復內識轉似外境，我法分別熏習力故，諸識生時變似我法，此我法相雖在內識，而由分別似外境現。	或復內識轉似外境，我法分別熏習力故，諸識生時變似我法，此我法相雖在內識，而由分別似外境現。	001	Or, internal consciousness transforms into the appearance of external objects, because of the power of perfuming of discrimination of self and dharmas. When consciousnesses arise, they transform into the appearance of self and dharmas. Although the characteristics of self and dharmas are in internal consciousness, they appear as if external objects because of discrimination.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b07_6']	諸有情類無始時來，緣此執為實我實法，如患夢者患夢力故，心似種種外境相現，緣此執為實有外境。	諸有情類無始時來，緣此執為實我實法，如患夢者患夢力故，心似種種外境相現，緣此執為實有外境。	001	Since beginningless time, sentient beings have taken this as a real self and real dharmas. It is like a person who is ill and dreaming. Because of the power of the illness, the mind manifests images of various external objects, and on the basis of this, one grasps at real external objects.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b08_15']	愚夫所計實我實法都無所有，但隨妄情而施設故，說之為假。	愚夫所計實我實法都無所有，但隨妄情而施設故，說之為假。	001	The real selves and real dharmas imagined by the ignorant do not exist at all, but are established in accordance with false ideas. Therefore, they are said to be fictional.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b10_5']	內識所變似我似法，雖有而非實我法性，然似彼現故說為假。	內識所變似我似法，雖有而非實我法性，然似彼現故說為假。	001	The transformations of internal consciousness that resemble a self and dharmas exist, but they are not of the nature of real selves and dharmas. However, they are said to be fictional because they appear to be those real selves and dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b11_1']	外境隨情而施設故，非有如識；	外境隨情而施設故，非有如識；	001	External objects are established in accordance with ideas and therefore do not exist as do consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b12_5']	內識必依因緣生故，非無如境，由此便遮增減二執。	內識必依因緣生故，非無如境，由此便遮增減二執。	001	Internal consciousnesses necessarily arise in dependence on causes and conditions and therefore are not nonexistent, like objects. This refutes the two extreme views of increase and decrease.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b13_1']	境依內識而假立故，唯世俗有；	境依內識而假立故，唯世俗有；	001	Objects are provisionally established in dependence on internal consciousnesses and therefore exist only conventionally.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b13_15']	識是假境所依事故，亦勝義有。	識是假境所依事故，亦勝義有。	001	Consciousness is the support for fictional objects and therefore exists ultimately.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b15_1']	云何應知實無外境唯有內識似外境生？	云何應知實無外境唯有內識似外境生？	001	How do we know that external objects do not really exist and that internal consciousness arises resembling external objects?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b15_10']	實我實法不可得故。	實我實法不可得故。	001	Because real selves and real dharmas cannot be found.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b16_1']	如何實我不可得耶？	如何實我不可得耶？	001	How can a real self not be apprehended?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b16_10']	諸所執我略有三種：	諸所執我略有三種：	001	The selves that are grasped are, in brief, of three kinds:
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b17_13']	一者執我體常周遍量同虛空，隨處造業受苦樂故。	一者執我體常周遍量同虛空，隨處造業受苦樂故。	001	The first is the view that the substance of the self is permanent, all-pervading, and as immense as space, because it creates karma in various places and experiences suffering and happiness.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b18_17']	二者執我其體雖常而量不定，隨身大小有卷舒故。	二者執我其體雖常而量不定，隨身大小有卷舒故。	001	The second is the view that the substance of the self is permanent but its size is indefinite, because it contracts and expands according to the size of the body.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b20_4']	三者執我體常至細如一極微，潛轉身中作事業故。	三者執我體常至細如一極微，潛轉身中作事業故。	001	The third is the view that the substance of the self is permanent but extremely subtle, like a single atom, and it moves about secretly in the body and performs actions.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b20_9']	初且非理。	初且非理。	001	The first is not reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b20_14']	所以者何？	所以者何？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b21_13']	執我常遍量同虛空，應不隨身受苦樂等。	執我常遍量同虛空，應不隨身受苦樂等。	001	If the self is grasped as permanent, all-pervading, and as immense as space, it should not experience suffering and happiness according to the body.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b22_13']	又常遍故應無動轉，如何隨身能造諸業？	又常遍故應無動轉，如何隨身能造諸業？	001	Moreover, because it is permanent and all-pervading, it should not move. How can it follow the body and create various actions?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b23_13']	又所執我，一切有情為同為異？	又所執我，一切有情為同為異？	001	Moreover, is the self grasped as the same for all sentient beings or different?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b25_14']	若言同者，一作業時一切應作，一受果時一切應受，一得解脫時一切應解脫，便成大過。	若言同者，一作業時一切應作，一受果時一切應受，一得解脫時一切應解脫，便成大過。	001	If it is said to be the same, then when one creates karma, all should create it, and when one experiences the results, all should experience them. When one attains liberation, all should attain it. This would be a great error.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b26_15']	若言異者，諸有情我更相遍故，體應相雜。	若言異者，諸有情我更相遍故，體應相雜。	001	If you say that the self is different from the body, then the self of all sentient beings would be mutually pervasive and therefore their bodies would be mixed up.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001b28_4']	又一作業一受果時，與一切我處無別故，應名一切所作所受。	又一作業一受果時，與一切我處無別故，應名一切所作所受。	001	Also, when one performs an action and experiences a result, since there is no difference in location from all other selves, it should be said that all selves perform and experience the action and result.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c01_4']	若謂作受各有所屬無斯過者，理亦不然，業果及身與諸我合，屬此非彼不應理故。	若謂作受各有所屬無斯過者，理亦不然，業果及身與諸我合，屬此非彼不應理故。	001	If you say that there is no error because the action and the experiencer are related to a particular self, this is also unreasonable, because the action, the result, and the body are related to the various selves, and it is unreasonable to say that they belong to this one and not to that one.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c02_6']	一解脫時一切應解脫，所修證法一切我合故。	一解脫時一切應解脫，所修證法一切我合故。	001	When one is liberated, all should be liberated, because the Dharma that is cultivated and realized is related to all selves.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c02_11']	中亦非理。	中亦非理。	001	The middle view is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c02_16']	所以者何？	所以者何？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c03_10']	我體常住，不應隨身而有舒卷。	我體常住，不應隨身而有舒卷。	001	The substance of the self is eternally abiding and should not expand and contract along with the body.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c04_6']	既有舒卷，如槖籥風，應非常住。	既有舒卷，如槖籥風，應非常住。	001	Since it expands and contracts, like the wind in a bellows, it should not be eternally abiding.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c05_17']	又我隨身應可分析，如何可執我體一耶？	又我隨身應可分析，如何可執我體一耶？	001	Also, since the self follows the body, it should be divisible. How can you hold that the substance of the self is one?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c06_8']	故彼所言如童竪戲。	故彼所言如童竪戲。	001	Therefore, what they say is like a child playing with building blocks.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c06_13']	後亦非理。	後亦非理。	001	The last view is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c06_18']	所以者何？	所以者何？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c07_17']	我量至小如一極微，如何能令大身遍動？	我量至小如一極微，如何能令大身遍動？	001	How can it cause the entire body to move if it is as small as an atom?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c09_16']	若謂雖小而速巡身如旋火輪似遍動者，則所執我非一非常，諸有往來非常一故。	若謂雖小而速巡身如旋火輪似遍動者，則所執我非一非常，諸有往來非常一故。	001	If you say that although it is small, it quickly moves through the body like a whirling torch, causing the body to move, then the self that you posit is not unitary and permanent, because it moves from place to place, and that which moves is not unitary and permanent.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c10_7']	又所執我復有三種：	又所執我復有三種：	001	Also, the self that is posited is of three kinds:
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c11_6']	一者即蘊、二者離蘊、三者與蘊非即非離。	一者即蘊、二者離蘊、三者與蘊非即非離。	001	the first is identical to the aggregates, the second is separate from the aggregates, and the third is neither identical to the aggregates nor separate from them.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c12_6']	初即蘊我，理且不然，我應如蘊非常一故。	初即蘊我，理且不然，我應如蘊非常一故。	001	The first, the self that is identical to the aggregates, is not reasonable, because the self would be impermanent and not unitary, like the aggregates.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c13_6']	又內諸色定非實我，如外諸色有質礙故。	又內諸色定非實我，如外諸色有質礙故。	001	Also, the internal material elements are definitely not the real self, because they are material and obstructive, like external material elements.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c14_6']	心心所法亦非實我，不恒相續待眾緣故。	心心所法亦非實我，不恒相續待眾緣故。	001	Mental activities and mental factors are also not the real self, because they are not a continuous series and depend on many conditions.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c15_6']	餘行餘色亦非實我，如虛空等非覺性故。	餘行餘色亦非實我，如虛空等非覺性故。	001	The remaining activities and the remaining material elements are also not the real self, because they are like space and so on and do not have the nature of awareness.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c16_6']	中離蘊我，理亦不然，應如虛空無作受故。	中離蘊我，理亦不然，應如虛空無作受故。	001	The middle position, the self that is separate from the aggregates, is also unreasonable, because it would be like space and would not have the function of knowing and feeling.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c17_15']	後俱非我，理亦不然，許依蘊立非即離蘊，應如瓶等非實我故。	後俱非我，理亦不然，許依蘊立非即離蘊，應如瓶等非實我故。	001	The latter two alternatives are also unreasonable, because it is admitted that the self is established on the basis of the aggregates, but is neither identical with nor different from the aggregates. It should be like a pot, etc., and not a real self.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c19_10']	又既不可說有為無為，亦應不可說是我非我，故彼所執實我不成。	又既不可說有為無為，亦應不可說是我非我，故彼所執實我不成。	001	Moreover, since it cannot be said that the self is conditioned or unconditioned, it also cannot be said that the self is or is not a self. Therefore the real self that is grasped does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c20_18']	又諸所執實有我體，為有思慮、為無思慮？	又諸所執實有我體，為有思慮、為無思慮？	001	Moreover, as for the substance of the self that is grasped as really existing, does it have thought or does it not have thought?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c21_18']	若有思慮，應是無常，非一切時有思慮故。	若有思慮，應是無常，非一切時有思慮故。	001	If it has thought, it should be impermanent, because it is not always associated with thought.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c23_1']	若無思慮，應如虛空，不能作業亦不受果。	若無思慮，應如虛空，不能作業亦不受果。	001	If it does not have thought, it should be like empty space, unable to act or experience results.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c23_11']	故所執我，理俱不成。	故所執我，理俱不成。	001	Therefore the self that is grasped does not exist in either case.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c24_18']	又諸所執實有我體，為有作用、為無作用？	又諸所執實有我體，為有作用、為無作用？	001	Moreover, as for the substance of the self that is grasped as really existing, does it have activity or does it not have activity?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c25_14']	若有作用，如手足等，應是無常。	若有作用，如手足等，應是無常。	001	If it has activity, it should be impermanent, like hands and feet, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c26_9']	若無作用，如兔角等，應非實我。	若無作用，如兔角等，應非實我。	001	If it does not have activity, like the horns of a rabbit, etc., it should not be a real self.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c27_1']	故所執我，二俱不成。	故所執我，二俱不成。	001	Therefore the self that is grasped does not exist in either case.
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c28_17']	又諸所執實有我體，為是我見所緣境不？	又諸所執實有我體，為是我見所緣境不？	001	Also, is the substance of the self that you affirm as really existing the object-support of the view of a self?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0001c29_16']	若非我見所緣境者，汝等云何知實有我？	若非我見所緣境者，汝等云何知實有我？	001	If it is not the object-support of the view of a self, how do you know that a self really exists?
['ZH_T31_1585_001:0002a02_3']	若是我見所緣境者，應有我見非顛倒攝，如實知故。	若是我見所緣境者，應有我見非顛倒攝，如實知故。	001	If it is the object-support of the view of a self, then the view of a self must not be included among the inverted views, because it is in accordance with reality.
