['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a06_24']	25 維摩經略疏卷第二十五今明此品，略用三意通釋：	25 維摩經略疏卷第二十五今明此品，略用三意通釋：	009	The brief commentary on the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, scroll 25, now clarifies this chapter, using three meanings in general:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a07_10']	一明此品來意、二釋此品名、三入文解釋。	一明此品來意、二釋此品名、三入文解釋。	009	First, clarifying the meaning of this chapter's coming; second, explaining the name of this chapter; third, entering the text for interpretation.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a10_13']	初明此品次〈觀眾生品〉來者，前品正明通相入空、正成〈問疾品〉通教從假入空，調伏界內有疾菩薩，兼成室外為國王長者說法，已如前說。	初明此品次〈觀眾生品〉來者，前品正明通相入空、正成〈問疾品〉通教從假入空，調伏界內有疾菩薩，兼成室外為國王長者說法，已如前說。	009	First, clarifying why this chapter comes after the Chapter on Contemplating Sentient Beings, the previous chapter correctly clarifies the general characteristics of entering emptiness, correctly accomplishing the Chapter on Asking about Illness, the common teaching from the provisional entering emptiness, taming bodhisattvas with illness within the realm, and also accomplishing the Dharma teachings outside the room for kings and elders, as already explained above.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a13_18']	今此品次明通相從空入假觀，明非道之道、非種之種、非眷屬之眷屬，此即不有而有，正成〈問疾品〉明別教通相從空入假觀，調伏恒沙實疾菩薩。	今此品次明通相從空入假觀，明非道之道、非種之種、非眷屬之眷屬，此即不有而有，正成〈問疾品〉明別教通相從空入假觀，調伏恒沙實疾菩薩。	009	Now, this chapter next clarifies the general characteristics of the contemplation of entering the provisional from emptiness, clarifying the path that is not a path, the seeds that are not seeds, and the retinue that is not a retinue. This is precisely the non-existent existence, which correctly forms the chapter on inquiring about illness to clarify the contemplation of entering the provisional from emptiness in the distinct teaching, taming bodhisattvas with real illnesses as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a15_5']	上文云「以無所受而受諸受，未具佛法不應滅受取證也。	上文云「以無所受而受諸受，未具佛法不應滅受取證也。	009	The above text says, By not accepting, one accepts all acceptances. If the Buddha's teachings are not yet complete, one should not extinguish acceptances and attain realization.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a15_17']	」亦兼為室外呵諸大弟子。	」亦兼為室外呵諸大弟子。	009	It also covers the scolding of the great disciples outside the room.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a17_10']	不能於諸見不動而修三十七品，以五逆相而得解脫等，故有此品來也。	不能於諸見不動而修三十七品，以五逆相而得解脫等，故有此品來也。	009	They are unable to cultivate the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment without moving in the various views, and to attain liberation through the characteristics of the five rebellious acts, and so forth. Therefore, this chapter comes.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a18_18']	次釋此品名，言「佛道」者，佛以覺為義，自覺覺他名之為佛。	次釋此品名，言「佛道」者，佛以覺為義，自覺覺他名之為佛。	009	Next, explaining the name of this chapter, Buddha's path means that the Buddha is defined by enlightenment, and self-enlightenment and enlightenment of others is called Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a20_2']	道以通達為義，所覺之理能通觀智從因達果名之為道。	道以通達為義，所覺之理能通觀智從因達果名之為道。	009	Path is defined by thorough understanding. The principle that is realized and the thoroughly understanding wisdom that can reach the fruition from the cause is called the path.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a20_15']	此以智理標名，故云佛道品。	此以智理標名，故云佛道品。	009	This uses the principle of wisdom to give it a name, so it is called the Buddha Way chapter.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a22_17']	正如此品用非道之理即是佛道，是以淨名答文殊云「菩薩行於非道通達佛道」，名為佛道。	正如此品用非道之理即是佛道，是以淨名答文殊云「菩薩行於非道通達佛道」，名為佛道。	009	Just as this chapter uses the principle of non-way as the Buddha way, therefore Vimalakīrti's answer to Mañjuśrī says The bodhisattva practices the non-way to penetrate the Buddha way, which is called the Buddha way.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a23_16']	言非道者，《大論》云「十二因緣有三種道：	言非道者，《大論》云「十二因緣有三種道：	009	As for the non-way, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says: The twelve links of dependent arising have three kinds of ways:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a24_6']	一煩惱道、二業道、三苦道。	一煩惱道、二業道、三苦道。	009	1. The way of afflictions, 2. the way of karma, 3. the way of suffering.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a25_24']	」煩惱即無明、愛、取三支，業即行、有二支，苦即識、名色、六入、觸、受、生、老死七支。	」煩惱即無明、愛、取三支，業即行、有二支，苦即識、名色、六入、觸、受、生、老死七支。	009	Afflictions are the three links of ignorance, craving, and grasping. Karma is the two links of volition and becoming. Suffering is the seven links of consciousness, name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, feeling, birth, and old age and death.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a26_13']	此之三道皆非佛道，故言非道。	此之三道皆非佛道，故言非道。	009	These three ways are all not the Buddha way, so they are called the non-way.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a28_6']	非道之理即是諸佛實相智慧功德之理，理即是道，故說非道即是佛道。	非道之理即是諸佛實相智慧功德之理，理即是道，故說非道即是佛道。	009	The principle of the non-way is precisely the principle of the true characteristics, wisdom, and merit and virtue of all buddhas. The principle is the way, so it is said that the non-way is precisely the Buddha way.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a28_8']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a29_9']	此品不約因緣明義，何得約因緣三道為非道也？	此品不約因緣明義，何得約因緣三道為非道也？	009	This chapter does not explain the meaning in terms of causes and conditions, so how can the three paths of causes and conditions be considered non-paths?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683a29_11']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b01_1']	一切非道不出此三。	一切非道不出此三。	009	All non-paths do not go beyond these three.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b01_4']	何者？	何者？	009	Which ones?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b02_3']	十界攝一切九皆非道，唯佛法界名為佛道。	十界攝一切九皆非道，唯佛法界名為佛道。	009	The ten realms encompass all, and nine of them are non-paths, only the Buddha realm is called the Buddha path.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b03_3']	此經明不思議佛道，故九界非道皆是佛道。	此經明不思議佛道，故九界非道皆是佛道。	009	This sutra clarifies the inconceivable Buddha path, therefore the non-paths of the nine realms are all the Buddha path.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b06_8']	是九界道中，六道是有為十二緣，三乘是無為十二緣，即世出世二邊之道各有三道，不能通相從空入假順入不思議解脫之道，故皆非佛道。	是九界道中，六道是有為十二緣，三乘是無為十二緣，即世出世二邊之道各有三道，不能通相從空入假順入不思議解脫之道，故皆非佛道。	009	Within these nine realm paths, the six destinies are conditioned twelve links, and the three vehicles are unconditioned twelve links, which are the paths of the two extremes of the world and beyond the world, each with three paths, which cannot penetrate from emptiness into the path of entering the inconceivable liberation, therefore they are all not the Buddha path.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b08_1']	但此品不別明菩薩是非道者，以有四教菩薩道故，別圓入中即是佛道。	但此品不別明菩薩是非道者，以有四教菩薩道故，別圓入中即是佛道。	009	But this chapter does not specifically clarify that the bodhisattvas are non-paths, because there are bodhisattva paths in the four teachings, and the distinct and perfect [teachings] entering the middle [way] are precisely the Buddha path.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b09_6']	復次方便菩薩皆有悲願，快順佛道，故不簡出實非佛道。	復次方便菩薩皆有悲願，快順佛道，故不簡出實非佛道。	009	Furthermore, expedient bodhisattvas all have compassion and vows, which quickly accord with the Buddha path, therefore they are not distinguished as truly not being the Buddha path.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b10_5']	若是佛道，淨名何故呵四菩薩八千之徒？	若是佛道，淨名何故呵四菩薩八千之徒？	009	If it is the Buddha's way, why did Vimalakīrti rebuke the four bodhisattvas and the eight thousand disciples?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b11_18']	復次此品明遍入諸道斷其因緣，豈不入方便教菩薩斷其有為無為緣集？	復次此品明遍入諸道斷其因緣，豈不入方便教菩薩斷其有為無為緣集？	009	Furthermore, this chapter clarifies the thorough entry into all paths and cutting off their causes and conditions. Wouldn't it be to enter the expedient teachings and for bodhisattvas to cut off the conditioned and unconditioned causes and conditions?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b12_1']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b13_6']	若佛是能覺智、道是所覺理者，此非道之理即佛性理不？	若佛是能覺智、道是所覺理者，此非道之理即佛性理不？	009	If the Buddha is the wisdom of enlightenment and the way is the principle of what is to be realized, is this not the principle of non-way, which is the principle of buddha-nature?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b13_8']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b13_13']	如所問也。	如所問也。	009	It is as you have asked.

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b14_10']	若即是者，佛性有三，謂正、緣、了。	若即是者，佛性有三，謂正、緣、了。	009	If it is precisely that, then buddha-nature has three aspects, namely correct, conditional, and realizing.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b14_19']	非道亦得是三因不？	非道亦得是三因不？	009	Can non-way also have these three causes?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b14_21']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b15_9']	亦如是，具如《玄義》。	亦如是，具如《玄義》。	009	It is also like this, as fully explained in the Profound Meaning.

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b16_4']	苦即正因，煩惱即了因，業即緣因。	苦即正因，煩惱即了因，業即緣因。	009	Suffering is the correct cause, afflictions are the realizing cause, and karma is the conditional cause.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b16_20']	故《大經》云「十二因緣名為佛性。	故《大經》云「十二因緣名為佛性。	009	Therefore the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: The twelve links of dependent arising are called buddha-nature.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b17_19']	」佛性不出三種，因名三種佛性、果名三德涅槃。	」佛性不出三種，因名三種佛性、果名三德涅槃。	009	Buddha-nature does not go beyond the three kinds. The causes are called the three kinds of buddha-nature, and the fruits are called the three qualities of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b18_2']	何者？	何者？	009	What is it?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b18_15']	苦即法性五陰，屬正因佛性。	苦即法性五陰，屬正因佛性。	009	Suffering is the nature of the five aggregates, belonging to the Buddha-nature of the direct cause.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b19_19']	故《大經》云「無明有愛，是二中間則有生死，名為中道。	故《大經》云「無明有愛，是二中間則有生死，名為中道。	009	Therefore the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, Between ignorance and craving, there is birth and death, which is called the middle way.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b20_6']	」中道者即是正因。	」中道者即是正因。	009	The middle way is precisely the direct cause.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b21_6']	若轉無明為明，是則由惑有解，即是了因。	若轉無明為明，是則由惑有解，即是了因。	009	If one transforms ignorance into understanding, then understanding arises due to delusion, which is the illuminating cause.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b22_2']	若轉惡為善，則由惡有善，即是緣因。	若轉惡為善，則由惡有善，即是緣因。	009	If one transforms evil into good, then good arises due to evil, which is the conditional cause.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b23_1']	故知三種非道之理，即是三種佛性之理。	故知三種非道之理，即是三種佛性之理。	009	Therefore, know that the principles of the three non-ways are precisely the principles of the three Buddha-natures.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b23_16']	故淨名言「行於非道通達佛道」。	故淨名言「行於非道通達佛道」。	009	Therefore Vimalakīrti said, Practicing the non-way, one penetrates the Buddha-way.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b23_18']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b24_7']	諸師多云此經未明佛性。	諸師多云此經未明佛性。	009	Many teachers say that this sūtra does not yet clarify the Buddha-nature.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b25_8']	何得引《涅槃》明十二因緣是佛性義以釋此品？	何得引《涅槃》明十二因緣是佛性義以釋此品？	009	How can one cite the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra to explain the meaning of the Buddha-nature in the twelve links of dependent arising in order to explain this chapter?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b25_10']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b26_11']	《大經》云「若言十一部經不明佛性，非謗佛法僧。	《大經》云「若言十一部經不明佛性，非謗佛法僧。	009	The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says, If one says that the eleven sūtras do not clarify the Buddha-nature, it is not slandering the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b27_9']	若說十二部經不明佛，性即謗佛法僧。	若說十二部經不明佛，性即謗佛法僧。	009	If the twelve divisions of the canon are explained without clarifying buddha-nature, then it is a slander of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b28_6']	」今此方等具十二部，何得言不明佛性？	」今此方等具十二部，何得言不明佛性？	009	Now this Vaipulya canon is complete with the twelve divisions, so how can it be said that it does not clarify buddha-nature?

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b29_6']	此經始終無佛性名，何得說言明佛性也？	此經始終無佛性名，何得說言明佛性也？	009	Throughout the beginning and end of this sutra, there is no mention of buddha-nature, so how can it be said that it clarifies buddha-nature?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683b29_8']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c02_5']	此品淨名說非道為道，文殊說非種為種，種性即是眼目異名，如天帝釋豈異憍尸？	此品淨名說非道為道，文殊說非種為種，種性即是眼目異名，如天帝釋豈異憍尸？	009	In this chapter, Vimalakīrti speaks of non-dharma as dharma, and Mañjuśrī speaks of non-seeds as seeds. Seeds and nature are just different names for the same thing, just as Indra is not different from Kauśika.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c04_10']	若謂不作佛性名說，不開佛性義者，有經不以二諦名說，亦應不開二諦，何得言諸佛常依二諦說法？	若謂不作佛性名說，不開佛性義者，有經不以二諦名說，亦應不開二諦，何得言諸佛常依二諦說法？	009	If it is said that because the term buddha-nature is not used, the meaning of buddha-nature is not revealed, then there are sūtras that do not use the term two truths, so they should not reveal the two truths either. How can it be said that all buddhas always rely on the two truths to expound the Dharma?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c04_12']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c05_3']	若佛性有三，種亦三不？	若佛性有三，種亦三不？	009	If buddha-nature is threefold, are the seeds also threefold?

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c05_9']	如所問。	如所問。	009	As you have asked.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c06_15']	故此品文殊言「有身為種」，六入為種即苦道正因種性之異名也。	故此品文殊言「有身為種」，六入為種即苦道正因種性之異名也。	009	Therefore, in this chapter, Mañjuśrī says that the body is the seed, and the six sense bases are the seed. This is just a different name for the direct cause and nature of the path of suffering.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c07_18']	「無明貪恚等為種」，即煩惱道了因種性之異名。	「無明貪恚等為種」，即煩惱道了因種性之異名。	009	Ignorance, greed, hatred, etc. are seeds is another name for the seed nature of the cause of understanding in the path of afflictions.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c08_17']	「十不善為種」，即業道緣因種性之異名也。	「十不善為種」，即業道緣因種性之異名也。	009	The ten unwholesome deeds are seeds is another name for the seed nature of the causal condition in the path of karma.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c10_12']	種性之與性，義實相映，故《法華》云「唯有如來知此眾生種相體性」，即其義也。	種性之與性，義實相映，故《法華》云「唯有如來知此眾生種相體性」，即其義也。	009	The meaning of seed nature and nature actually reflects each other, so the Lotus Sutra says, Only the Tathagata knows the seeds, characteristics, essence, and nature of these sentient beings, which is the meaning of this.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c10_14']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c11_4']	種以能生為義，義映無常。	種以能生為義，義映無常。	009	Seeds have the meaning of being able to produce, which reflects impermanence.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c11_16']	性以不改為義，義映於常。	性以不改為義，義映於常。	009	Nature has the meaning of immutability, which reflects permanence.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c12_7']	此二義別，何得言映？	此二義別，何得言映？	009	These two meanings are different, so how can they be said to reflect each other?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c12_9']	答：	答：	009	Answer:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c12_19']	緣了映種，不足致疑。	緣了映種，不足致疑。	009	The reflection of conditions and understanding on seeds is not enough to raise doubts.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c13_17']	但正因映種義似有乖，深求其致亦相映也。	但正因映種義似有乖，深求其致亦相映也。	009	But the reflection of the direct cause on seeds seems to be contradictory. If one deeply seeks the reason, they also reflect each other.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c15_15']	如真非因果說為正因，是則非因性為正因性，何以不得非因種說為正因種子？	如真非因果說為正因，是則非因性為正因性，何以不得非因種說為正因種子？	009	If the truth, which is not a cause and effect, is said to be the direct cause, then the nature of non-cause becomes the nature of the direct cause. Why can't the seed of non-cause be said to be the seed of the direct cause?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c15_17']	問：	問：	009	Question:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c17_14']	若此經明如來種與涅槃佛性同者，何故言「若見無為入正位者不能復發菩提心也。	若此經明如來種與涅槃佛性同者，何故言「若見無為入正位者不能復發菩提心也。	009	If this sutra's explanation of the Tathagata's seeds is the same as the Buddha-nature of the Nirvana Sutra, why does it say that those who see the unconditioned and enter the correct position cannot give rise to the bodhi mind again?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c18_1']	猶如根敗。	猶如根敗。	009	It is like a rotten root.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c18_21']	」種義可斷，佛性之義則不可斷，何以得同？	」種義可斷，佛性之義則不可斷，何以得同？	009	The meaning of seeds can be severed, but the meaning of Buddha-nature cannot be severed. How can they be the same?
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0683c19_1']	答：	答：	009	Answer:

Just as fire arises from firewood, when the firewood is exhausted, the fire goes out. Therefore, when the two vehicles completely sever the bonds, they lose the cause for the Buddha's wisdom and are unable to perfect the knowledge of all modes, losing the cause for realization.

Good and evil are both produced by the six consciousnesses. Apart from the six consciousnesses, there is no evil and no good, and no seeds of the indirect cause.

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690a24_17']	此品來意者，遠從前來所彈菩薩，住通教及別教地前來，得入此門無生忍位，今欲顯成圓別之教於二門中無所拘滯，通而不壅亦不通中住也。	此品來意者，遠從前來所彈菩薩，住通教及別教地前來，得入此門無生忍位，今欲顯成圓別之教於二門中無所拘滯，通而不壅亦不通中住也。	009	The reason for this chapter is that, from the previous criticism of bodhisattvas abiding in the teachings of the Shared and Distinct Teachings, they have entered this gate of the stage of forbearance of non-arising.

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690b23_18']	就各說中有三十三菩薩，若准此文五千皆說，但三十三者必有所表，今作三義往釋：	就各說中有三十三菩薩，若准此文五千皆說，但三十三者必有所表，今作三義往釋：	009	Among the individual explanations there are thirty-three bodhisattvas. If following this text, all five thousand speak. But the thirty-three must have something they represent. Now I will explain using three meanings:
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690b26_1']	一明三十三者，表三十三天有不死之藥，菩薩即三十三天共說不二之門，即是不死甘露也。	一明三十三者，表三十三天有不死之藥，菩薩即三十三天共說不二之門，即是不死甘露也。	009	First, clarifying the thirty-three. It represents the thirty-three heavens having the medicine of immortality. The bodhisattvas are the thirty-three heavens speaking together about the non-dual gate, which is the immortal sweet dew.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690b28_3']	即用三十三對四十二地，用三十對三十心，用二對等覺妙覺，一對十地，此則合地開三十心。	即用三十三對四十二地，用三十對三十心，用二對等覺妙覺，一對十地，此則合地開三十心。	009	Then using the thirty-three to correspond to the forty-two grounds. Using the thirty to correspond to the thirty minds. Using two to correspond to the wondrous enlightenment and marvelous enlightenment. Using one to correspond to the ten grounds. This combines the grounds and opens up the thirty minds.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690b29_10']	若如《仁王》明十四度，合三十心為三，開十地為十，妙覺為一。	若如《仁王》明十四度，合三十心為三，開十地為十，妙覺為一。	009	If like the Benevolent Kings clarifying the fourteen perfections, it combines the thirty minds into three and opens the ten grounds into ten, with wondrous enlightenment as one.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c01_5']	亦對《大品》四十二字門初阿後荼。	亦對《大品》四十二字門初阿後荼。	009	It also corresponds to the Great Vehicle forty-two letter gate, from the initial A to the final D.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c03_2']	初阿名諸法初不生，此中最初法自在菩薩說不生不滅入不二法門，即阿字義。	初阿名諸法初不生，此中最初法自在菩薩說不生不滅入不二法門，即阿字義。	009	The first syllable a means the non-arising of all dharmas from the beginning. Here, the first Dharma-sovereign Bodhisattva spoke of non-arising and non-ceasing entering the non-dual Dharma door, which is the meaning of the syllable a.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c06_16']	亦如《中論》八不初辨不生不滅，若聞阿字門即解一切義，初阿字具四十二字功德，後荼亦具四十二字功德，中四十字皆具四十二功德，故初地即具四十二地功德。	亦如《中論》八不初辨不生不滅，若聞阿字門即解一切義，初阿字具四十二字功德，後荼亦具四十二字功德，中四十字皆具四十二功德，故初地即具四十二地功德。	009	It is also like the eight negations in the Madhyamaka-śāstra, which initially distinguish non-arising and non-ceasing. If one hears the a gate, one immediately understands all meanings. The initial syllable a possesses the merits of the forty-two syllables, and the final syllable ta also possesses the merits of the forty-two syllables. The forty syllables in the middle all possess the merits of the forty-two, so the first ground immediately possesses the merits of the forty-two grounds.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c07_18']	若無分別中而論分別，不二而二說有四十二地。	若無分別中而論分別，不二而二說有四十二地。	009	If one discusses distinctions within non-discrimination, it is said that there are forty-two grounds, with two within the non-dual.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c09_12']	若分別中無分別而二不二者，一地之中皆具諸地、一字之中皆具諸字。	若分別中無分別而二不二者，一地之中皆具諸地、一字之中皆具諸字。	009	If there is no discrimination within discrimination, and the two are non-dual, then each ground possesses all grounds, and each syllable possesses all syllables.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c11_2']	過荼無字可說者，如維摩是最後荼字妙覺之地，是故默然無言。	過荼無字可說者，如維摩是最後荼字妙覺之地，是故默然無言。	009	As for there being no syllable to speak of beyond ta, Vimalakīrti is the final syllable ta, the ground of wondrous enlightenment. Therefore, he was silent and did not speak.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c11_16']	當知三十三菩薩即表此之三義。	當知三十三菩薩即表此之三義。	009	It should be known that the thirty-three bodhisattvas immediately illustrate these three meanings.

However, it is because they each entered the truth and severed bonds through one dharma.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c15_2']	今逐說而觀之，故別不同，名為各說身因。	今逐說而觀之，故別不同，名為各說身因。	009	Now, following the explanations and contemplating them, the differences are distinguished, called each speaking of the causes of their bodies.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c15_14']	見理無異，故言無非正說。	見理無異，故言無非正說。	009	Seeing the principle is no different, so it is said there is nothing that is not correct.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c17_10']	此三十三菩薩亦復如是，無生之理不殊，而入門不同、觀法各異，故有三十三種。	此三十三菩薩亦復如是，無生之理不殊，而入門不同、觀法各異，故有三十三種。	009	These thirty-three bodhisattvas are also like this. The principle of non-arising is not different, but the entrances are not the same, and the contemplated dharmas are each different, so there are thirty-three kinds.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c18_6']	如云「泥洹真法寶，眾生以種種門入。	如云「泥洹真法寶，眾生以種種門入。	009	As it is said, The true treasure of nirvāṇa, sentient beings enter through various gates.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c19_14']	」三、就化他為語，即是隨四悉檀機悟不同，約物有異致有差別。	」三、就化他為語，即是隨四悉檀機悟不同，約物有異致有差別。	009	Third, speaking from transforming others, it is precisely according to the different understandings of the four siddhāntas. Distinctions are made due to the differences in beings.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c20_17']	實行之者未入無生，樂聞無生無滅，即是隨世界。	實行之者未入無生，樂聞無生無滅，即是隨世界。	009	Those who truly practice, who have not yet entered non-arising, delight in hearing non-arising and non-cessation, which is in accordance with the world.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c22_1']	或執生滅，即用無生無滅，即斥其生滅，即是隨對治。	或執生滅，即用無生無滅，即斥其生滅，即是隨對治。	009	Some cling to arising and ceasing, and then use non-arising and non-cessation to rebuke their arising and ceasing, which is in accordance with the counteractive.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c23_13']	或有人聞餘法不生善心，若聞無生無滅，雙亡二邊善心即進，即是為人。	或有人聞餘法不生善心，若聞無生無滅，雙亡二邊善心即進，即是為人。	009	Some people hear other teachings and do not give rise to a good mind, but if they hear non-arising and non-cessation, which transcends both extremes, their good mind immediately progresses, which is for the sake of others.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c24_15']	隨得悟處，亦五千之觀悟無生忍者，即第一義也。	隨得悟處，亦五千之觀悟無生忍者，即第一義也。	009	In accordance with the place of realization, the five thousand who observed and realized the acceptance of non-arising is the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c26_3']	據一門之中皆具四意，我無我、常無常、垢淨、苦樂等亦如是。	據一門之中皆具四意，我無我、常無常、垢淨、苦樂等亦如是。	009	Based on a single approach, all four intentions are present. Self and non-self, permanence and impermanence, defilement and purity, suffering and joy, and so forth are also like this.

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0690c28_17']	文殊以無言言於無言，淨名以無言無言，是名圓教。	文殊以無言言於無言，淨名以無言無言，是名圓教。	009	Mañjuśrī uses the inexpressible to speak of the inexpressible, and Vimalakīrti uses the inexpressible to be inexpressible, this is called the perfect teaching.

['ZH_T38_1778_009:0691a03_2']	乃不當言與無言，亦得論言無言，是故文殊顯不思議聖說法，故以言言於無言。	乃不當言與無言，亦得論言無言，是故文殊顯不思議聖說法，故以言言於無言。	009	It is neither to be spoken nor unspoken, and it can also be discussed as spoken and unspoken. Therefore, Mañjuśrī manifests the inconceivable holy teaching, and thus uses speech to speak of the unspeakable.
['ZH_T38_1778_009:0691a04_12']	維摩顯聖默然，故以無言無言，此之聖說即是默然、默然即是聖說。	維摩顯聖默然，故以無言無言，此之聖說即是默然、默然即是聖說。	009	Vimalakīrti manifests the holy silence, and thus uses the unspeakable to speak of the unspeakable. This holy teaching is precisely the silence, and the silence is precisely the holy teaching.
