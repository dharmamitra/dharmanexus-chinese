['ZH_T29_1558_001:0001a23_10']	眾生於中淪沒無救，世尊哀愍隨授所應，正法教手拔濟令出。	眾生於中淪沒無救，世尊哀愍隨授所應，正法教手拔濟令出。	Sentient beings are submerged in it without rescue. The World-Honored One, out of compassion, bestows the appropriate right Dharma teachings like a hand to pull them out and save them.

['ZH_T29_1558_001:0001a28_8']	如理師言顯利他德，能方便說如理正教，從生死泥拔眾生出，不由威力與願神通。	如理師言顯利他德，能方便說如理正教，從生死泥拔眾生出，不由威力與願神通。	The words a teacher of the correct principles show the virtue of benefiting others. He is able to skillfully expound the correct principles and the right teachings, and to pull sentient beings out of the mud of birth and death, not by his power, vows, or spiritual penetrations.
