Now, when I examine its essence, it is originally cursive script, but in the process of transmission, it has become increasingly erroneous. Whenever I read its text, I am always confused by the beginning and end, and I have examined the original text many times and made some judgments. I have already proofread half of it and changed the previous course. Although I am afraid of going against the deep thoughts of the sages of the past, I only do it to encourage the wise understanding of later students. There are still many omissions that need to be corrected.
