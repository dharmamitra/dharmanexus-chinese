['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a05_5']	此初覺相也。	此初覺相也。	003	This is the initial characteristic of enlightenment.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a05_16']	此義云何者問覺不覺義。	此義云何者問覺不覺義。	003	What does this mean? This question asks about the meaning of enlightenment and non-enlightenment.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a06_6']	下舉四相而釋其義。	下舉四相而釋其義。	003	Below, it uses the four characteristics to explain its meaning.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a06_15']	舉前三位未至心源。	舉前三位未至心源。	003	It mentions the first three stages that have not yet reached the source of the mind.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a07_1']	釋非究竟。	釋非究竟。	003	This explains that they are not ultimate.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a07_10']	舉後一位覺至心源。	舉後一位覺至心源。	003	The last position is when one realizes the mind's source.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a08_5']	今應先明四相之義。	今應先明四相之義。	003	Now, one should first clarify the meaning of the four characteristics.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a08_14']	然後依義釋文顯相。	然後依義釋文顯相。	003	Then, based on the meaning, explain the text to reveal the characteristics.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a09_4']	然四相義釋者煩多。	然四相義釋者煩多。	003	However, the explanations of the meaning of the four characteristics are numerous.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a09_9']	論意難知。	論意難知。	003	The meaning of the treatise is difficult to understand.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a09_14']	今數四說。	今數四說。	003	Now, I will explain it several times.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a09_19']	此中有義。	此中有義。	003	Among them, there is an interpretation.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a10_11']	所說四相即依動念剎那而說。	所說四相即依動念剎那而說。	003	The four characteristics mentioned are based on the momentary movement of thought to explain.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a10_18']	心隨妄動名生。	心隨妄動名生。	003	The mind following false movement is called arising.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a11_6', 'ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a11_13']	生已逕停名住。🔽住已衰變名異。	生已逕停名住。 住已衰變名異。	003	Having arisen, it is called abiding.🔽Having abided, it is called changing.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a12_1']	異已遷謝名滅。	異已遷謝名滅。	003	Having changed, it is called ceasing.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a12_7']	然生已至滅。	然生已至滅。	003	However, having arisen and reached cessation,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a12_12']	滅已復生。	滅已復生。	003	having ceased, it arises again.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a13_1']	總攝四相名為生滅。	總攝四相名為生滅。	003	Collectively encompassing the four characteristics is called arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a13_10']	是故但名生滅門耳。	是故但名生滅門耳。	003	Therefore, it is simply called the arising and ceasing gate.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a13_19']	覺此四相故有四位。	覺此四相故有四位。	003	Because one realizes these four characteristics, there are four positions.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a14_8']	四位逆次覺四相也。	四位逆次覺四相也。	003	The four positions are in reverse order, realizing the four characteristics.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a14_17']	故說凡夫能覺知等。	故說凡夫能覺知等。	003	Therefore, it is said that ordinary beings can be aware of them, and so on.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a15_1']	有義。	有義。	003	There is an interpretation.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a15_8']	此說其理不成。	此說其理不成。	003	This explanation is logically untenable.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a15_17']	若念遷謝名滅相者。	若念遷謝名滅相者。	003	If the passing away of thought is called the characteristic of cessation,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a16_6']	即凡夫念應永不滅。	即凡夫念應永不滅。	003	Then the thoughts of ordinary beings should never cease.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a16_15']	覺滅相已則不滅故。	覺滅相已則不滅故。	003	Because once the characteristic of cessation is realized, it does not cease.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a17_5']	異住等相為難亦然。	異住等相為難亦然。	003	The same difficulty applies to the characteristics of abiding, etc.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a17_18']	若凡夫位雖覺滅相滅相仍在。	若凡夫位雖覺滅相滅相仍在。	003	If in the stage of ordinary beings, although the characteristic of cessation is realized, the characteristic of cessation still remains,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a18_12']	應至佛位雖覺生相生相猶存。	應至佛位雖覺生相生相猶存。	003	then one should reach the stage of Buddhahood, although the characteristic of birth is realized, the characteristic of birth still remains.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a19_3']	所起覺相何成利益。	所起覺相何成利益。	003	What benefit is there in the arising of the characteristics of realization?
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a19_16']	又既自說生已至滅滅已復生。	又既自說生已至滅滅已復生。	003	Moreover, since it is said that after arising one reaches cessation, and after cessation one arises again,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a20_12']	既覺滅相不滅故不生不生故不滅。	既覺滅相不滅故不生不生故不滅。	003	since the characteristic of cessation is realized and does not cease, therefore it does not arise. Since it does not arise, therefore it does not cease.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a21_4']	即應凡夫位離生滅念。	即應凡夫位離生滅念。	003	Then one should be free from the thoughts of arising and ceasing in the stage of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a21_13']	住異等相為難亦爾。	住異等相為難亦爾。	003	The same difficulty applies to the characteristics of abiding, etc.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a22_4']	故此所說理必不成故。	故此所說理必不成故。	003	Therefore, what is said here definitely cannot be established.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a22_12']	四相者應依識辨。	四相者應依識辨。	003	Therefore, the four characteristics should be explained based on consciousness.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a23_10']	謂由無明違平等性起業轉現三種生相。	謂由無明違平等性起業轉現三種生相。	003	That is to say, due to ignorance violating the nature of equality, the three characteristics of arising, i.e., karma, transformation, and manifestation, arise.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a24_1']	相心今生成黎耶識。	相心今生成黎耶識。	003	The characteristic mind now generates the ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a24_10']	故業轉現皆名生相。	故業轉現皆名生相。	003	Therefore, karma, transformation, and manifestation are all called the characteristic of arising.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a24_17']	雖此一心為生。	雖此一心為生。	003	Although this one mind is the arising,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a25_9']	所生而亦非是我我所相。	所生而亦非是我我所相。	003	that which arises is also not the characteristic of self and what belongs to self.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a25_18']	無明與前生相和合。	無明與前生相和合。	003	Ignorance combines with the previously arisen birth link.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a26_8']	迷所生心無我我所。	迷所生心無我我所。	003	It causes the mind that is born to be deluded about self and what belongs to self.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a27_7']	復能發起我癡我見我慢我愛四種住相。	復能發起我癡我見我慢我愛四種住相。	003	It can also give rise to the four kinds of abiding characteristics of self-ignorance, self-view, self-conceit, and self-love.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a27_12']	相前生心。	相前生心。	003	The characteristics of the previously arisen mind.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a28_2']	今至住位起我我所。	今至住位起我我所。	003	Now, having reached the stage of abiding, it gives rise to self and what belongs to self.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a28_7']	內緣而住。	內緣而住。	003	It abides internally as its object.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a28_18']	即所相心成第七識能相。	即所相心成第七識能相。	003	The characterized mind becomes the seventh consciousness, and the characteristics
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a29_5']	四惑而為住相。	四惑而為住相。	003	The four delusions become the characteristics of abiding.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122a29_14']	無明與彼住相和合。	無明與彼住相和合。	003	Ignorance combines with those characteristics of abiding.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b01_4']	不覺所計我我所空。	不覺所計我我所空。	003	It causes unawareness of the emptiness of the self and what belongs to the self that are conceived.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b01_13']	復能發起六種異相。	復能發起六種異相。	003	It can also give rise to six kinds of different characteristics.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b02_3']	謂貪嗔癡慢疑惡見。	謂貪嗔癡慢疑惡見。	003	Namely, greed, anger, delusion, pride, doubt, and wrong views.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b02_12']	相前住心今至異位。	相前住心今至異位。	003	The characteristics of the previously abiding mind now reach the different stage.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b03_2']	外向攀緣成六異識。	外向攀緣成六異識。	003	It externally directs and grasps at objects, becoming the six different consciousnesses.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b03_11']	故六煩惱名為異相。	故六煩惱名為異相。	003	Therefore, the six afflictions are called the characteristics of difference.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b04_1']	無明復與異相和合。	無明復與異相和合。	003	Ignorance again combines with the characteristics of difference.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b04_10']	不覺外塵違順性離。	不覺外塵違順性離。	003	It causes unawareness of the nature of external objects being contrary or agreeable and being devoid of self.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b04_19']	由是發起七支惡業。	由是發起七支惡業。	003	Because of this, it gives rise to the seven kinds of evil karma.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b05_8']	能滅異心墮於惡趣。	能滅異心墮於惡趣。	003	It can destroy the different mind and cause one to fall into evil destinies.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b05_17']	故彼七支名為滅相。	故彼七支名為滅相。	003	Therefore, those seven are called the characteristics of destruction.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b06_15']	能相四相所至之位取境別相皆為心所。	能相四相所至之位取境別相皆為心所。	003	The four characteristics as the能相 are the state reached by the 所相, which grasps the specific characteristics of objects and is all mental activities.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b07_10']	由本無明違平等性之所起故。	由本無明違平等性之所起故。	003	Because they arise from the fundamental ignorance that violates the nature of equality.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b08_9']	所相之心所至之位取境通相而為心王。	所相之心所至之位取境通相而為心王。	003	The mind as the 所相 is the state reached by the 能相, which grasps the general characteristics of objects and is the mental king.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b09_4']	由從本心諸法總源之所起故。	由從本心諸法總源之所起故。	003	Because it arises from the fundamental mind, the general source of all dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b09_13']	皆依心起名俱時有。	皆依心起名俱時有。	003	All arise based on the mind and are called simultaneous.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b10_3']	有麁細故覺時差別。	有麁細故覺時差別。	003	Because there are coarse and subtle distinctions, there are differences in the time of awakening.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b10_13']	此說理亦未然。	此說理亦未然。	003	This explanation is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b11_3']	別有能相所相法者。	別有能相所相法者。	003	There are separate 能相 and 所相 dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b11_12']	是小乘宗非大乘故。	是小乘宗非大乘故。	003	This is the doctrine of the Lesser Vehicle, not the Great Vehicle, because
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b12_10']	大乘四相但是假立於起有為無功德故。	大乘四相但是假立於起有為無功德故。	003	in the Great Vehicle the four characteristics are merely provisionally established in order to have merit in the arising of conditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b13_1']	此中四相雖說虛妄。	此中四相雖說虛妄。	003	Herein, although the four characteristics are said to be false,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b13_10']	因緣所起非假說故。	因緣所起非假說故。	003	they arise from causes and conditions and are not provisional.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b14_1']	若由無明起業轉現相。	若由無明起業轉現相。	003	If the characteristics of activity, transformation, and manifestation arise due to ignorance,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b14_9']	心今作業轉等者。	心今作業轉等者。	003	and now the mind performs activity, transformation, etc.,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b15_5']	即業轉現皆應有二能相二義異故。	即業轉現皆應有二能相二義異故。	003	then activity, transformation, etc. should all have two 能相 and two different meanings.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b15_14']	心若不作業轉等者。	心若不作業轉等者。	003	If the mind does not perform activity, transformation, etc.,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122b16_5']	如何能成黎耶生相。	如何能成黎耶生相。	003	How can it be established that the arising characteristic of the ālaya is produced?

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c19_6']	既由無明鼓心令動遂有微著不同。	既由無明鼓心令動遂有微著不同。	003	Since it is caused by ignorance stirring the mind to move, there are differences in subtlety.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c19_12']	而先後際異。	而先後際異。	003	And there are differences between the prior and subsequent limits.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c20_1']	先際名為生相。	先際名為生相。	003	The prior limit is called the characteristic of arising.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c20_10']	後際最麁名為滅相。	後際最麁名為滅相。	003	The subsequent limit, which is the coarsest, is called the characteristic of ceasing.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c21_9']	對位分相。	對位分相。	003	The characteristics are distinguished based on stages.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c21_18']	即九相中前之八相。	即九相中前之八相。	003	They are the first eight characteristics among the nine characteristics.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c22_16']	一者即初業相。	一者即初業相。	003	One refers to the first stage of activity.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c24_13']	論說佛地斷微細念。	論說佛地斷微細念。	003	The treatise says that the Buddha ground eliminates subtle thoughts.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c25_3']	細中之細是佛境界。	細中之細是佛境界。	003	The most subtle of the subtle is the realm of the Buddha.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c25_12']	故知唯業是生相也。	故知唯業是生相也。	003	Therefore, we know that only karma is the characteristic of birth.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c27_1']	麁分之位。	麁分之位。	003	The first two are the stages of the gross part of the fundamental consciousness.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c27_10', 'ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c27_15']	是法我執所住之境。🔽後二事識。	是法我執所住之境。 後二事識。	003	They are the objects of abiding of the grasping of the self of dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c28_1']	細分之位。	細分之位。	003	The last two are the stages of the subtle part of the consciousness of objects.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c28_10']	是法我執能住之心。	是法我執能住之心。	003	They are the minds of abiding of the grasping of the self of dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c29_4']	無明與前生相和合轉彼靜心。	無明與前生相和合轉彼靜心。	003	Ignorance combines with the characteristic of birth and transforms that still mind.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1122c29_13']	乃至此位行相猶細。	乃至此位行相猶細。	003	Up to this stage, the mode of activity is still subtle.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a01_9']	但是能所別法執□住未別異故。	但是能所別法執□住未別異故。	003	It is only the separate grasping of the self of dharmas, not yet separate from the abiding.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a02_4']	故下論說法身菩薩覺於念住。	故下論說法身菩薩覺於念住。	003	Therefore, the treatise below says that bodhisattvas of the Dharma stage are aware of abiding in thought.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a03_7']	麁中之細細中之麁菩薩境界界此四相總名住相。	麁中之細細中之麁菩薩境界界此四相總名住相。	003	The four characteristics are collectively called the characteristic of abiding.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a03_12']	異相二者。	異相二者。	003	The two characteristics of change are:
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a04_6']	謂次二相即是執取計名字相。	謂次二相即是執取計名字相。	003	The next two characteristics, namely, the characteristics of grasping and conceptualizing names and words.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a05_9']	無明與前住相和合轉彼靜心至此事識麁分之位。	無明與前住相和合轉彼靜心至此事識麁分之位。	003	Ignorance combines with the previous stage of abiding and turns the still mind to this stage of coarse differentiation of the consciousness of this matter.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a05_14']	行相稍麁。	行相稍麁。	003	The mode of activity becomes slightly coarser.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a06_8']	依於異根取別異境起異執故。	依於異根取別異境起異執故。	003	It relies on different faculties to grasp different objects and give rise to different attachments.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a07_8']	故下論說新發意菩薩覺於念異捨麁分別。	故下論說新發意菩薩覺於念異捨麁分別。	003	Therefore, the treatise below says that bodhisattvas who have newly given rise to the intention are aware of the difference in thought and abandon coarse discrimination.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a07_17']	麁中之麁凡夫境界。	麁中之麁凡夫境界。	003	The coarsest of the coarse is the realm of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a08_7']	此麁中麁既是意識。	此麁中麁既是意識。	003	Since this coarsest of the coarse is the mental consciousness,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a08_16']	意識即攝此二相故。	意識即攝此二相故。	003	the mental consciousness includes these two characteristics.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a09_6']	故此二相總名為異。	故此二相總名為異。	003	Therefore, these two characteristics are collectively called difference.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a09_11']	滅相一者。	滅相一者。	003	The one characteristic of cessation
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a09_16']	即起業相。	即起業相。	003	is precisely the characteristic of giving rise to karma.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a10_14']	即由無明轉彼靜心至此後際周盡之位。	即由無明轉彼靜心至此後際周盡之位。	003	It is precisely due to ignorance that the still mind turns to this final stage of exhaustion.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a11_13']	能令靜心□於六道如□伎人作牛馬等。	能令靜心□於六道如□伎人作牛馬等。	003	It can cause the still mind to be reborn in the six destinies like an actor playing the role of an ox, horse, and so forth.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a12_10']	故下論說造種種業受果不自在故。	故下論說造種種業受果不自在故。	003	Therefore, the treatise below says that it creates various karmas and experiences fruits without freedom.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a13_1']	以此九相數處得名。	以此九相數處得名。	003	These nine characteristics are named according to their frequency and location.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a13_6']	或開九相。	或開九相。	003	Sometimes the nine characteristics are distinguished,

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1123a15_1']	故今細位說為四相。	故今細位說為四相。	003	Therefore, in the subtle stage, they are said to be the four characteristics.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b18_3']	若妄念息即知心相生住異滅皆無有相。	若妄念息即知心相生住異滅皆無有相。	003	If deluded thoughts cease, one knows that the arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing of the characteristics of the mind are all without characteristics.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b25_3']	初標不異。	初標不異。	003	First, it states that it is no different.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b25_12']	雖曰始得無念之覺。	雖曰始得無念之覺。	003	Although it is said to be the initial attainment of the enlightenment of non-thought,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b26_2', 'ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b26_12']	而覺四相方名始覺。🔽然所覺相本來無起待。	而覺四相方名始覺。 然所覺相本來無起待。	003	The enlightenment of the four characteristics is then called initial enlightenment.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b27_1']	何不覺始覺別耶。	何不覺始覺別耶。	003	However, the characteristics that are enlightened are originally without arising. What is the difference between the initial enlightenment and the non-enlightenment?
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b27_10']	以四相下後以釋成。	以四相下後以釋成。	003	The following uses the four characteristics to explain and prove.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b28_8']	以彼四相無別自體可辨前後故言俱時。	以彼四相無別自體可辨前後故言俱時。	003	Because those four characteristics have no separate self-nature that can be distinguished as before and after, it is said to be simultaneous.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b29_7']	依於一心麁細之念故說覺時而有前後。	依於一心麁細之念故說覺時而有前後。	003	It is based on the coarse and fine thoughts of one mind that it is said that there is a before and after in the state of enlightenment.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125b29_15']	言而有即前後也。	言而有即前後也。	003	There is refers to the before and after.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c01_6']	非謂四相而俱是有。	非謂四相而俱是有。	003	It does not mean that the four characteristics are all existent.

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c02_14']	是故說言皆無自立。	是故說言皆無自立。	003	Therefore, it is said that they all have no independent existence.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c03_4']	既本離心皆無自性。	既本離心皆無自性。	003	Since they are originally apart from the mind and all have no self-nature,

['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c04_10']	此總意云。	此總意云。	003	This general meaning is as follows:
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c04_19']	既覺四相說為始覺。	既覺四相說為始覺。	003	Since the four characteristics of enlightenment are said to be initial enlightenment,
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c05_8']	所覺無故能覺亦無。	所覺無故能覺亦無。	003	Since there is nothing to be enlightened to, the ability to be enlightened to also does not exist.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c05_17']	故無始覺異於本覺。	故無始覺異於本覺。	003	Therefore, there is no initial enlightenment that is different from original enlightenment.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c06_7']	或此真顯始不異本。	或此真顯始不異本。	003	Or this true [enlightenment] shows that the initial is not different from the original.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c07_6']	謂前所說四種覺相離於本覺皆不可得。	謂前所說四種覺相離於本覺皆不可得。	003	It is said that the previously mentioned four aspects of enlightenment are inseparable from original enlightenment and cannot be attained.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c07_11']	故新論云。	故新論云。	003	Therefore, the new treatise says:
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c08_4']	如是知已則知始覺不可得。	如是知已則知始覺不可得。	003	Having understood this, one should know that initial enlightenment cannot be attained.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c09_7']	以於一心前後同時皆不相應無自性故不異本覺。	以於一心前後同時皆不相應無自性故不異本覺。	003	Because in the one mind, before and after, and simultaneously, they are all not in accord and have no self-nature, they are not different from original enlightenment.
['ZH_T85_2814_003:1125c09_16']	若作此釋於理無違。	若作此釋於理無違。	003	If this interpretation is made, it does not contradict reason.
