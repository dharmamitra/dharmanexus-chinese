['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c18_2']	論曰：	論曰：	005	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c19_1']	如何不與色等諸境而相關涉，名作見耶？	如何不與色等諸境而相關涉，名作見耶？	005	How is it that it is not related to form and other objects, yet is called seeing?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c19_11']	若遣斯難，此不勞言。	若遣斯難，此不勞言。	005	If this difficulty is to be dispelled, there is no need to speak of it.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c20_8']	由斯識體自現形相，雖無色等而境得成。	由斯識體自現形相，雖無色等而境得成。	005	Because the essence of consciousness manifests its own form and appearance, although there is no form, etc., the object can be established.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c21_12']	此前已說，夢獄瞖等為能喻事，隨其所應廣陳比量。	此前已說，夢獄瞖等為能喻事，隨其所應廣陳比量。	005	This has already been explained before, using dreams, prisons, cataracts, etc. as analogies, extensively presenting logical reasoning according to what is appropriate.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c23_5']	從此生憶念者，不待外境而現前故，見之自性方始得生。	從此生憶念者，不待外境而現前故，見之自性方始得生。	005	As for the arising of memory from this, it appears before one without depending on external objects, and the self-nature of seeing is only then able to arise.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c25_17']	雖無實義，念與意俱，由現見識所有功能安置力故，隨其次第假藉餘緣為能牽引，覺想方生，當爾之時名為憶念。	雖無實義，念與意俱，由現見識所有功能安置力故，隨其次第假藉餘緣為能牽引，覺想方生，當爾之時名為憶念。	005	Although there is no real meaning, memory arises together with the mind. Due to the power of the function and placement of consciousness that is directly perceived, it relies on other conditions in sequence and is drawn by them, and then conceptual thought arises. At that time, it is called memory.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c26_10']	如何復知見之與憶兩體差殊？	如何復知見之與憶兩體差殊？	005	How do we know that seeing and memory have different natures?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0092c29_12']	若此見憶俱竝不藉外境有故能生自體，由似境者為性邪疑，說分別識見之為用，不生計度前境相狀，但有自證體性生起念之相也。	若此見憶俱竝不藉外境有故能生自體，由似境者為性邪疑，說分別識見之為用，不生計度前境相狀，但有自證體性生起念之相也。	005	If both seeing and memory do not rely on external objects to exist, they can generate their own natures. The nature of the one that resembles the object is called the discriminating consciousness. Seeing is said to be its function. It does not generate conceptualization of the appearance of the object in front. It only has the nature of self-realization and the appearance of memory.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a01_12']	取其言相安布之差，了相不明分別生也。	取其言相安布之差，了相不明分別生也。	005	The difference in the arrangement of the characteristics of the words is due to the unclear discrimination of the characteristics of the object.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a02_11']	以見為先熏習所遣，即此自性由他故生。	以見為先熏習所遣，即此自性由他故生。	005	Because seeing is preceded by perfuming, it is eliminated. This self-nature arises due to others.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a03_14']	見不然也，見之與念條然別故，為此定須許如斯理。	見不然也，見之與念條然別故，為此定須許如斯理。	005	Seeing is not like this, because seeing and memory are completely different. Therefore, it is necessary to admit this principle.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a05_12']	假令雖復有其外境，二皆有境緣相不殊，見之與憶自體不同，如有異途幸應為說。	假令雖復有其外境，二皆有境緣相不殊，見之與憶自體不同，如有異途幸應為說。	005	Even if there are external objects, the two have the same characteristics of objects as conditions. The natures of seeing and memory are not the same. If there is a different path, you should explain it.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a06_15']	彼設雖緣現在之境名之為見，如緣過去說之為念。	彼設雖緣現在之境名之為見，如緣過去說之為念。	005	Even if it is said that the one that conditions the present object is called seeing, and the one that conditions the past is called memory.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a09_7']	由無境者彼雖境異有無之相，所緣別故，斯之異相緣亦不能而於見念為片思也，宜應說為自體別故斯成異相。	由無境者彼雖境異有無之相，所緣別故，斯之異相緣亦不能而於見念為片思也，宜應說為自體別故斯成異相。	005	Although the object is different in existence and non-existence, because the objects are different, this different aspect cannot be the object of seeing and memory, and cannot be a part of thought. It should be said that it becomes a different aspect because of the difference in self-nature.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a10_8']	爾者此境是其識所現相，若為決定知如是耶？	爾者此境是其識所現相，若為決定知如是耶？	005	In that case, is this object the aspect that appears to consciousness? If so, how can one know it for certain?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a13_5']	由於前境決知見已，與彼相似所起之識分明不忘，取彼事時即名斯事而為似相，猶如決了丈夫相貌方名此作似丈夫耶。	由於前境決知見已，與彼相似所起之識分明不忘，取彼事時即名斯事而為似相，猶如決了丈夫相貌方名此作似丈夫耶。	005	Having decisively seen the previous object, the consciousness that arises similar to it is clearly remembered without forgetting. When grasping that event, it is called that event and taken as a similar aspect. Is it like decisively knowing the appearance of a man and then calling it a similar man?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a15_3']	似相了知非不曾見，然非曾見能有如斯決斷之理，為由不許有外境故，斯亦非理。	似相了知非不曾見，然非曾見能有如斯決斷之理，為由不許有外境故，斯亦非理。	005	Knowing a similar aspect is not not seeing it before, but it is not the case that what has been seen before can have such decisive understanding. Is it because it is not admitted that there are external objects? This is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a16_11']	由彼自證心心所生解相不同是所許故，斯固於他全不成難。	由彼自證心心所生解相不同是所許故，斯固於他全不成難。	005	Because it is admitted that the self-realization of mind and mental factors arises with different aspects, this certainly does not become a complete difficulty for others.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a17_6']	汝既分別於事善巧，我聊致問：	汝既分別於事善巧，我聊致問：	005	Since you are skilled in discerning things, I will ask you a question:
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a17_15']	理復如何同時自證？	理復如何同時自證？	005	How can the simultaneous self-realization of principles be so?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a18_8']	既不許有，如何此見能決定耶？	既不許有，如何此見能決定耶？	005	Since it is not allowed to exist, how can this view be certain?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a19_7']	非過去事能有憶念，由彼非是自證性故。	非過去事能有憶念，由彼非是自證性故。	005	Past events cannot have memory, because they are not of the nature of self-realization.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a20_2']	又非自證，如所說事違道理故。	又非自證，如所說事違道理故。	005	And because it is not self-realization, it contradicts reason as explained.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a21_1']	先當援己後乃擊他，所有陳謀方能獲勝。	先當援己後乃擊他，所有陳謀方能獲勝。	005	First one should draw on oneself, then one can strike others. Only by having a plan can one achieve victory.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a21_13']	斯即念託境生，不共成也。	斯即念託境生，不共成也。	005	This is that memory relies on the object to arise, not being accomplished together.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a23_11']	復於夢處領納外境，令共成託，後時自可道彼元無成非理故，猶如樂等領受樂事。	復於夢處領納外境，令共成託，後時自可道彼元無成非理故，猶如樂等領受樂事。	005	Moreover, in a dream one receives the external object, allowing it to be accomplished together, and later one can say that it was originally non-existent, because it is not reasonable. It is like receiving pleasant things.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a25_13']	若其外境元有可領，但有似相錯亂現前，當爾之時外境非有自然決斷，猶如夢者覺乃知非。	若其外境元有可領，但有似相錯亂現前，當爾之時外境非有自然決斷，猶如夢者覺乃知非。	005	If the external object originally exists and can be received, but there is only a similar appearance that appears erroneously, at that time the external object does not exist and naturally decides, just like a dreamer who upon waking knows it was not real.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a26_11']	夢者見非有，覺已乃知非。	夢者見非有，覺已乃知非。	005	A dreamer sees what is not there, and upon waking knows it was not.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a27_15']	若也覺時亦不領境，猶如夢中彼是非有，世人自知。	若也覺時亦不領境，猶如夢中彼是非有，世人自知。	005	If one is not aware of objects during the waking state, it is like in a dream, and worldly people themselves know this.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093a29_8']	然不如是，是故定知於正覺時，然色等境有真領受，不同夢中識無力用。	然不如是，是故定知於正覺時，然色等境有真領受，不同夢中識無力用。	005	However, it is not so. Therefore, it is definitely known that when one is truly awake, there is true awareness of objects such as form, unlike in a dream where consciousness is powerless.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b01_7']	此亦不能而為曉喻，令於色等領受義成。	此亦不能而為曉喻，令於色等領受義成。	005	This also cannot serve as an analogy to make the meaning of awareness of form, etc. be established.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b02_5']	由作夢者處夢中時，不能了境是為非有。	由作夢者處夢中時，不能了境是為非有。	005	Because when a dreamer is in a dream, they cannot understand that objects are nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b04_16']	若由遠離於睡闇時得分明慧，隨其所有別別曾緣熏成念種，然於夢位所領之境憶令上心，方生決斷此事非有。	若由遠離於睡闇時得分明慧，隨其所有別別曾緣熏成念種，然於夢位所領之境憶令上心，方生決斷此事非有。	005	If it is due to being far removed from the darkness of sleep and attaining clear wisdom, then according to what is separately and previously experienced, it perfuses and forms the seeds of memory. However, in the dream state, the objects that are experienced cause the mind to remember and produce a decisive understanding that this is nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b05_7']	彼既如是，此亦還然。	彼既如是，此亦還然。	005	Since it is so for that, it is also so for this.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b07_17']	雖非外色可為領受，便即翻作見外色心，起妄分別，重重現前數數緣慮，生此類性所有功能，熏習成種令其上心。	雖非外色可為領受，便即翻作見外色心，起妄分別，重重現前數數緣慮，生此類性所有功能，熏習成種令其上心。	005	Although it is not external matter that is grasped, it immediately turns into the mind that sees external matter, gives rise to false discrimination, manifests repeatedly, and repeatedly conditions, producing the function of this kind of nature, perfuming and forming seeds to cause the upper mind.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b09_2']	即此熏習，更欲彰其不實事故，後起餘緣彰見真義。	即此熏習，更欲彰其不實事故，後起餘緣彰見真義。	005	This very perfuming, wanting to manifest its unreality, later gives rise to other conditions to manifest the true meaning of seeing.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b10_10']	由有睡眠相似法故，雖於覺位亦曰睡也，為此熏習恒隨逐故。	由有睡眠相似法故，雖於覺位亦曰睡也，為此熏習恒隨逐故。	005	Because there is a similar dharma of sleep, although in the state of awakening it is also called sleep, it is because this perfuming always follows.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b12_12']	世間睡眠猶如餘睡，但有妄情離識別見色聲等境，而被纏縛極受艱辛，漂泊生津淪迴欲海。	世間睡眠猶如餘睡，但有妄情離識別見色聲等境，而被纏縛極受艱辛，漂泊生津淪迴欲海。	005	Worldly sleep is like the other sleep, but there is only false emotion. Apart from consciousness, one sees forms, sounds, etc., and is bound, greatly suffering, drifting in the current of birth and drowning in the ocean of desire.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b14_15']	由未正得熏習斷故，猶如夢中不能覺了色等境無，未能稱事於非起故，不了是無，為境所誑。	由未正得熏習斷故，猶如夢中不能覺了色等境無，未能稱事於非起故，不了是無，為境所誑。	005	Because the perfuming has not yet been correctly eliminated, it is like in a dream, unable to understand that forms, etc., do not exist. Because one is not yet able to accord with things and not give rise to them, one does not understand that they are non-existent and is deceived by objects.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b16_18']	縱有聞思所生之智，為由分別熏習隨故，未現證真不能正起，亦名誑妄，當爾之時名為不覺。	縱有聞思所生之智，為由分別熏習隨故，未現證真不能正起，亦名誑妄，當爾之時名為不覺。	005	Even if there is the wisdom born from hearing and contemplation, it is due to the perfuming of discrimination and follows after it. Not yet directly realizing the truth, it cannot arise correctly, and is also called deceptive and false. At that time, it is called non-awakening.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b19_10']	及由於彼熏習種子對治已生，畢竟拔除深有力用，於創起時非世先有，由此名為出世間智，正斷一切分別性故。	及由於彼熏習種子對治已生，畢竟拔除深有力用，於創起時非世先有，由此名為出世間智，正斷一切分別性故。	005	When the seeds of perfuming are eliminated by the antidotes, and the deep and powerful function is completely eradicated, it arises for the first time, not having existed before in the world. For this reason, it is called supramundane wisdom, because it correctly eliminates all discriminating natures.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b20_13']	無分別智獲得現行，能除熏習無知睡故，證悟真覺。	無分別智獲得現行，能除熏習無知睡故，證悟真覺。	005	Non-discriminating wisdom attains manifestation and can remove the sleep of perfuming ignorance, thus realizing true awakening.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b22_15']	于時藉此無分別智以為因故，由此之力方便起故，決能截除色等諸義固執熏習，名為清淨。	于時藉此無分別智以為因故，由此之力方便起故，決能截除色等諸義固執熏習，名為清淨。	005	At that time, relying on this non-discriminating wisdom as the cause, and by the power of skillfully giving rise to it, one is able to sever the perfuming of attachment to forms and other objects. This is called purity.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b23_10']	由涉計度諸境相故，號曰世間。	由涉計度諸境相故，號曰世間。	005	Because it engages in conceptualizing the characteristics of various objects, it is called mundane.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b25_12']	彼智現已，但唯是識隨其色類緣會力故生起之時，唯於自識現其相分，妄執諸境而作生因。	彼智現已，但唯是識隨其色類緣會力故生起之時，唯於自識現其相分，妄執諸境而作生因。	005	When that cognition appears, it is only consciousness. Due to the power of the convergence of conditions, when it arises, it only manifests its image part in one's own consciousness, mistakenly grasping at various objects as the cause of arising.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b26_11']	然非離識有自性故，色聲等境而生了知。	然非離識有自性故，色聲等境而生了知。	005	However, because there is no self-nature apart from consciousness, objects such as form and sound do not give rise to cognition.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b27_19']	其所立量若據總相，不知彼境是為無者，許能立因有不成過。	其所立量若據總相，不知彼境是為無者，許能立因有不成過。	005	If the established inference is based on the general characteristics, not knowing that the object is nonexistent is considered to be a fault in the reason of the proof.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093b29_12']	若言差別覺時不知，還有不成與前相似，覺悟之位了境元無，宗所許故。	若言差別覺時不知，還有不成與前相似，覺悟之位了境元無，宗所許故。	005	If it is said that when there is discrimination, it is still not known, there is still a fault of non-establishment similar to the previous case. At the stage of awakening, realizing that the object is originally nonexistent is because it is accepted by the thesis.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c01_14']	既有斯過，理固不能以斯能立成其前境有可領納。	既有斯過，理固不能以斯能立成其前境有可領納。	005	Since there is this fault, reasoning certainly cannot use this proof to establish that the previous object can be perceived.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c03_9']	或有於此不成之過，申述解詞，猶若元來不為境解此無之智，理不應成。	或有於此不成之過，申述解詞，猶若元來不為境解此無之智，理不應成。	005	Or there is this fault of non-establishment. Explaining the words is still like originally not understanding the nonexistence of the object. This cognition of nonexistence should not be established.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c04_8']	要先知境，方於此事能生此心，說為非有。	要先知境，方於此事能生此心，說為非有。	005	It is necessary to first know the object, and only then can this mind arise regarding this matter, saying it does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c05_6']	若爾的知前境是有，如何能得更復言無？	若爾的知前境是有，如何能得更復言無？	005	If so, how can one cognize the existence of the prior object and still say it is nonexistent?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c06_1']	觀相是有，復乃云無，現是相違。	觀相是有，復乃云無，現是相違。	005	Observing the characteristics as existent and then saying they are nonexistent is clearly contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c07_1']	若為通釋彼諸宗等撥為非有，固不相違。	若為通釋彼諸宗等撥為非有，固不相違。	005	If one explains those schools as denying existence, it is not contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c08_1']	如諸外論謂為常等，生前滅後悉並非無。	如諸外論謂為常等，生前滅後悉並非無。	005	Like the eternalist non-Buddhist treatises, which say that what arises before and ceases later is not nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c08_21']	或於方所，或此非餘，有境無餘，何過之有？	或於方所，或此非餘，有境無餘，何過之有？	005	Or in a certain place, or this is not the other, there is an object but not the other, what fault is there?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c09_18']	若時於我將為無者，由非不了，可撥為無。	若時於我將為無者，由非不了，可撥為無。	005	If at that time one is about to make the self nonexistent, it is not because of non-understanding that one can deny it as nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c11_2']	於無起知，非所許故，此不如文於茲色等說我為無。	於無起知，非所許故，此不如文於茲色等說我為無。	005	Because generating knowledge of nonexistence is not accepted, this is not like the text saying here that form, etc. are nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c12_1']	然於色等造作之處，無真實我，非據我也。	然於色等造作之處，無真實我，非據我也。	005	However, in the place where form, etc. are created, there is no real self, not according to the self.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c13_2']	若爾於色等聚乍可無𠎝說識我無，如何免難？	若爾於色等聚乍可無𠎝說識我無，如何免難？	005	If so, it may be possible to say that consciousness is nonexistent in the aggregate of form, etc., but how can one avoid the difficulty?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c14_14']	由不許有第二之識，於餘識處了我為無，亦非不領於前而能憶念於後。	由不許有第二之識，於餘識處了我為無，亦非不領於前而能憶念於後。	005	Because a second consciousness is not admitted, when the other consciousnesses are absent, the self is also absent. Moreover, it is not the case that one does not experience the former and is able to remember the latter.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c16_3']	設令生念，境已亡故，是故應許但唯有識而現於相，即如所許。	設令生念，境已亡故，是故應許但唯有識而現於相，即如所許。	005	Even if one generates memory, the object has already disappeared. Therefore, it must be admitted that there is only consciousness that appears as an image, just as it is admitted.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c17_11']	然於識處知我是無，撥無其我，識若生時，此智爾時知無我體。	然於識處知我是無，撥無其我，識若生時，此智爾時知無我體。	005	However, in the place of consciousness, one knows that the self is absent. Denying the self, when consciousness is born, at that time this knowledge knows that the self does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c18_19']	然由離境了唯有識，隨此相貌緣若生時解境為無，豈非齊致？	然由離境了唯有識，隨此相貌緣若生時解境為無，豈非齊致？	005	However, because one is apart from the object and only knows that there is consciousness, when the image of this consciousness is born, one understands the object as absent. How is this not the same?
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c20_17']	然於色等了無我時，於色等處是為共相非是自相，由此各依以為定性，自體異故。	然於色等了無我時，於色等處是為共相非是自相，由此各依以為定性，自體異故。	005	However, when one understands the absence of self in form and so forth, in the place of form and so forth, this is a common characteristic, not a specific characteristic. Because of this, each relies on it as a fixed nature, because the substance is different.
['ZH_T31_1591_005:0093c23_17']	然非相似所有相貌是實事有，欲令於餘而作簡別，有其異相附識而生，猶如實事有集心分，於識自體轉起現前，世俗言論因斯生起。	然非相似所有相貌是實事有，欲令於餘而作簡別，有其異相附識而生，猶如實事有集心分，於識自體轉起現前，世俗言論因斯生起。	005	However, the appearances of things that are not similar do not actually exist.
