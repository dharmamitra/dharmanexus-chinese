['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a03_8']	二柔和善順，身隨妙行、語起善言、心無惡想，外離麁獷名曰柔和，內契玄宗名為善順。	二柔和善順，身隨妙行、語起善言、心無惡想，外離麁獷名曰柔和，內契玄宗名為善順。	Second, being gentle and compliant. Physically, one follows wonderful practices; verbally, one speaks good words; mentally, one has no evil thoughts. Being free from coarseness externally is called gentleness, and inwardly conforming to the profound truth is called compliance.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a04_6']	三而不卒暴，卒謂卒爾，暴謂縱橫。	三而不卒暴，卒謂卒爾，暴謂縱橫。	Third, not being rash or violent. Rash means sudden, and violent means unrestrained.

Seeing what is possible and advancing, knowing what is difficult and retreating, is called not being rash.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a08_2']	設思而起亦不非理，名為不卒暴。	設思而起亦不非理，名為不卒暴。	Even if one acts after careful consideration, it should still be in accordance with reason, and is called not being rash or violent.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a08_18']	「卒」音麁沒反，若倉猝作「猝」。	「卒」音麁沒反，若倉猝作「猝」。	Cuo is pronounced as cuo with the fourth tone, and if written as cuo with the first tone, it is also correct.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a09_16']	「猝」音《切韻》「則沒、子出二反」，俱非此用。	「猝」音《切韻》「則沒、子出二反」，俱非此用。	Cuo is pronounced as zuo with the second tone and zuo with the third tone in the Qieyun dictionary, but neither is used here.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a10_6']	《玉篇》為「倉卒」，亦為「猝」字。	《玉篇》為「倉卒」，亦為「猝」字。	Yudian has cang cuo and also writes it as cuo.

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a14_10']	供養、親近、打罵、疎背、名利、威勢、毀辱、擯默、利衰、毀譽、稱譏、苦樂，於此一切安固不動，心亦不驚。	供養、親近、打罵、疎背、名利、威勢、毀辱、擯默、利衰、毀譽、稱譏、苦樂，於此一切安固不動，心亦不驚。	Whether one is worshipped, served, beaten, scolded, neglected, slandered, praised, humiliated, expelled, or ignored, whether one gains profit or suffers loss, is praised or disparaged, is honored or insulted, or experiences suffering or joy, one remains steadfast and unmoved, and one's mind is not startled.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a14_15']	故有頌言：	故有頌言：	Therefore, there is a verse that says:
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a16_12']	「諸佛常遊於世間，　利樂一切有情類，　八法熱風邪分別，　不能傾動不拘礙。	「諸佛常遊於世間，　利樂一切有情類，　八法熱風邪分別，　不能傾動不拘礙。	The Buddhas always roam in the world, benefiting and delighting all sentient beings. The eight dharmas, the hot wind, and discrimination cannot sway or obstruct them.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a19_2']	」或住忍辱地總句，語常柔和、善順身安而不卒暴，內心恒亦不驚，三業順此理而行於有，何經弘而見擁？	」或住忍辱地總句，語常柔和、善順身安而不卒暴，內心恒亦不驚，三業順此理而行於有，何經弘而見擁？	Or abiding in the stage of patience is the general term. Speech is always gentle and well-behaved, the body is peaceful and not hasty, and the inner mind is always fearless. The three karmas accord with this principle and practice in existence. What sutra is widely circulated and seen as obstructive?
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a20_12']	忍辱名地者，地是所依生長之義，以忍為依生長善故，喻之於地。	忍辱名地者，地是所依生長之義，以忍為依生長善故，喻之於地。	Patience is called the stage because the stage is the meaning of the basis for birth and growth. Using patience as the basis for the birth and growth of goodness is likened to the earth.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a23_10']	又云從喻為名，行忍之時如地而忍順違不動，故鑿深谿而不怒，搆崇堂而不愛，遇萬物而皆載，任德用而逾大。	又云從喻為名，行忍之時如地而忍順違不動，故鑿深谿而不怒，搆崇堂而不愛，遇萬物而皆載，任德用而逾大。	It is also said that the name is taken from the analogy. When practicing patience, it is like the earth in enduring both favorable and unfavorable circumstances without moving. Therefore, digging a deep valley does not cause anger, building a lofty hall does not cause love, encountering myriad things all carries them, and the use of virtue becomes greater.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a24_14']	掘擾發於甘泉，種蒔竟無希賚，故行三忍標以地名。	掘擾發於甘泉，種蒔竟無希賚，故行三忍標以地名。	Digging and stirring up sweet springs, planting and ending without hoping for rewards, therefore practicing the three forbearances is marked by the stage name.

Within all dharmas, one only sees sentient beings and dharmas as empty, without discrimination.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b01_11']	執著為有，而觀諸法如實相者，既觀我、法二空為門，復觀諸法如來藏性。	執著為有，而觀諸法如實相者，既觀我、法二空為門，復觀諸法如來藏性。	Attaching to existence and contemplating the true characteristics of dharmas, having already contemplated the two emptinesses of self and dharmas as the gateway, one further contemplates the nature of the tathāgatagarbha within all dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b03_2']	法之真理如實體相，我法體無名之為空，其如來藏名為空性。	法之真理如實體相，我法體無名之為空，其如來藏名為空性。	The true principle and essence of dharmas is the true nature of the characteristics of the essence. The self and dharmas are devoid of essence, which is called emptiness. The tathāgatagarbha is called the nature of emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b04_4']	不觀二空門，不見空真性，故此二種同名空觀。	不觀二空門，不見空真性，故此二種同名空觀。	Not contemplating the two emptinesses as the gateway, one does not see the true nature of emptiness. Therefore, these two kinds are both called the contemplation of emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b05_9']	經「亦不行不分別」。	經「亦不行不分別」。	The sūtra says: Also, do not practice and do not discriminate.

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b08_11']	上來所觀空有，恐滯空有之中，故今雙觀拂，謂雖觀空而亦不行滯著空中，謂雖觀有而不分別滯著有中，應俱無住而明觀法。	上來所觀空有，恐滯空有之中，故今雙觀拂，謂雖觀空而亦不行滯著空中，謂雖觀有而不分別滯著有中，應俱無住而明觀法。	The emptiness and existence contemplated above may lead to being stuck in emptiness or existence, so now both are contemplated and brushed away. This means that although one contemplates emptiness, one also does not practice or become attached to emptiness. Although one contemplates existence, one does not discriminate or become attached to existence. One should be without abiding in either, and clearly contemplate the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b10_14']	若有所住者則為非住，故下頌雖依人法二空解此二種，總是於法而無所行攝，於理無違。	若有所住者則為非住，故下頌雖依人法二空解此二種，總是於法而無所行攝，於理無違。	If there is something to abide in, then it is not abiding. Therefore, although the lower verse relies on the two kinds of emptiness of person and dharmas, this is all included in the phrase not practicing with regard to dharmas, and there is no contradiction in principle.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b12_5']	又復於法無所行觀諸法空，頌言不行上中下法，有為無為故。	又復於法無所行觀諸法空，頌言不行上中下法，有為無為故。	Moreover, in the phrase not practicing with regard to dharmas, observing dharmas as empty, the verse says not practicing superior, middling, and inferior dharmas, conditioned or unconditioned.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b14_4']	亦不行不分別，如次不行我、我所執，觀眾生為空，頌言亦不分別是男是女等。	亦不行不分別，如次不行我、我所執，觀眾生為空，頌言亦不分別是男是女等。	Also, in the phrase not practicing and not discriminating, one does not practice and discriminate the grasping of self and what belongs to self, observing sentient beings as empty. The verse says also not discriminating male or female, etc.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b15_4']	由觀此二我、法為空，便證二空如實之性。	由觀此二我、法為空，便證二空如實之性。	By observing these two as empty of self and dharmas, one then realizes the true nature of the two kinds of emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b16_8']	又於法無所行者，謂不行所說法中唯觀實相真如。	又於法無所行者，謂不行所說法中唯觀實相真如。	Moreover, in the phrase not practicing with regard to dharmas, it means not practicing within the taught dharmas, only observing the true characteristics of suchness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b17_2']	亦不行者，不行我能說中。	亦不行者，不行我能說中。	Also, in the phrase not practicing, it means not practicing within the one who is able to teach.

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b22_1']	雖作此行，亦不作真智行，於實相為有；	雖作此行，亦不作真智行，於實相為有；	Although one engages in such practices, one does not engage in the practice of true wisdom, because in reality there is something;

Because of non-practice and non-discrimination, false illusions are all removed. Because of nothing not practiced and nothing not discriminated, one thoroughly penetrates the ultimate reality.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b28_4']	由此雙修照辨一切，於事依他住忍地等，於理成實觀如實相，所執人、法皆照為空。	由此雙修照辨一切，於事依他住忍地等，於理成實觀如實相，所執人、法皆照為空。	Based on this, one cultivates both illumination and discernment of all things. Abiding in the stage of patience in the dependent arising of events, etc., in principle, one contemplates the true reality as it is, and illuminates the emptiness of the grasped person and dharmas.
