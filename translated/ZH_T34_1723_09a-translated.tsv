Among the three types of distribution mentioned earlier, the first four chapters praise and distribute the sutra. The following seven chapters distribute the sutra through learning and practice. The correct practice and auxiliary practices of propagating this sutra should be free from harm and destruction.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0818c25_8']	雖已讚重，若不說所學能行弘經之行，末世多難頻生傷毀不能弘通，故說七品學行流通：	雖已讚重，若不說所學能行弘經之行，末世多難頻生傷毀不能弘通，故說七品學行流通：	09a	Although it has already been praised and distributed, if the learned and practiced methods of propagating the sutra are not explained, there will be frequent harm and destruction in the latter age, and it will not be able to be distributed. Therefore, the seven chapters on learning and practicing the distribution of the sutra are taught:
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0818c27_6']	一〈安樂行〉，二〈湧出〉，三〈壽量〉，四〈分別功德〉，五〈隨喜功德〉，六〈法師功德〉，七〈常不輕〉。	一〈安樂行〉，二〈湧出〉，三〈壽量〉，四〈分別功德〉，五〈隨喜功德〉，六〈法師功德〉，七〈常不輕〉。	09a	1. The practice of ease and bliss, 2. The emergence [of the earth], 3. The life span [of the Buddha], 4. The distinctions in merit, 5. The merit of rejoicing, 6. The merit of the Dharma teacher, 7. The always-disparaged [bodhisattva].

People achieve virtue through the Dharma, and the Dharma is propagated through people.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0819a01_9']	若無所學之行，其人何由建德，故〈安樂品〉為所學行；	若無所學之行，其人何由建德，故〈安樂品〉為所學行；	09a	If there are no practices to learn, how can people establish virtue? Therefore, the chapter on Peaceful Joy is the practice to learn;
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0819a03_2']	若無能行之人，其法無因廣布，故〈湧出〉等為能行人，故前品後此品來也。	若無能行之人，其法無因廣布，故〈湧出〉等為能行人，故前品後此品來也。	09a	If there are no people who can practice, the Dharma has no means to spread widely. Therefore, the chapters starting with Emerging from the Earth are the people who can practice. Thus, this chapter comes after the previous chapter.

This refers to a person with merits who expounds the Mahayana Dharma, but takes the pride of superiority in what is not the Mahayana. For this person, the Buddha expounds the bright pearl in his topknot and gives it to him.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0819a11_10']	求三乘果者名集功德人，昔雖總相為說大乘，彼心未定退趣一乘而將為勝、取非大乘，說功勳小但賜餘物。	求三乘果者名集功德人，昔雖總相為說大乘，彼心未定退趣一乘而將為勝、取非大乘，說功勳小但賜餘物。	09a	Those who seek the fruits of the three vehicles are called people who accumulate merits. In the past, although the Mahayana was expounded in general terms, their minds were not yet determined and they retreated to the One Vehicle, taking what is not the Mahayana to be superior, and were said to have little merit and only given other things.

He never ceases to engage with conditions, and is therefore called practice.

When teaching practice, the mind abides in the gate of emptiness and existence. Abiding in the two gates serves as the fundamental basis for attracting the arising of other practices. It is not the initial practice, but it is also universal to the mind.

It is necessary for bodhisattvas to first contemplate the emptiness of the three things of person and dharma, and then be able to physically avoid evil conduct, verbally conform to the principles of right goodness, extinguish thoughts of flattery and deception, give rise to the mind of compassion and so forth, stop one's own sores and scabs and avoid others' criticism and slander, greatly propagate the teachings and never cease, benefiting many beings and never falling - this is the great meaning in this [chapter].

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0819c31_2']	有行有四：	有行有四：	09a	There are four practices in existence:

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a03_8']	二柔和善順，身隨妙行、語起善言、心無惡想，外離麁獷名曰柔和，內契玄宗名為善順。	二柔和善順，身隨妙行、語起善言、心無惡想，外離麁獷名曰柔和，內契玄宗名為善順。	09a	Second, being gentle and compliant. Physically, one follows wonderful practices; verbally, one speaks good words; mentally, one has no evil thoughts. Being free from coarseness externally is called gentleness, and inwardly conforming to the profound truth is called compliance.

Seeing what is possible and advancing, knowing what is difficult and retreating, is called not being rash.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a08_2']	設思而起亦不非理，名為不卒暴。	設思而起亦不非理，名為不卒暴。	09a	Even if one acts after careful consideration, it should still be in accordance with reason, and is called not being rash or violent.

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a14_15']	故有頌言：	故有頌言：	09a	Therefore, there is a verse that says:
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a16_12']	「諸佛常遊於世間，　利樂一切有情類，　八法熱風邪分別，　不能傾動不拘礙。	「諸佛常遊於世間，　利樂一切有情類，　八法熱風邪分別，　不能傾動不拘礙。	09a	The Buddhas always roam in the world, benefiting and delighting all sentient beings. The eight dharmas, the hot wind, and discrimination cannot sway or obstruct them.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a19_2']	」或住忍辱地總句，語常柔和、善順身安而不卒暴，內心恒亦不驚，三業順此理而行於有，何經弘而見擁？	」或住忍辱地總句，語常柔和、善順身安而不卒暴，內心恒亦不驚，三業順此理而行於有，何經弘而見擁？	09a	Or abiding in the stage of patience is the general term. Speech is always gentle and well-behaved, the body is peaceful and not hasty, and the inner mind is always fearless. The three karmas accord with this principle and practice in existence. What sutra is widely circulated and seen as obstructive?
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a20_12']	忍辱名地者，地是所依生長之義，以忍為依生長善故，喻之於地。	忍辱名地者，地是所依生長之義，以忍為依生長善故，喻之於地。	09a	Patience is called the stage because the stage is the meaning of the basis for birth and growth. Using patience as the basis for the birth and growth of goodness is likened to the earth.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a23_10']	又云從喻為名，行忍之時如地而忍順違不動，故鑿深谿而不怒，搆崇堂而不愛，遇萬物而皆載，任德用而逾大。	又云從喻為名，行忍之時如地而忍順違不動，故鑿深谿而不怒，搆崇堂而不愛，遇萬物而皆載，任德用而逾大。	09a	It is also said that the name is taken from the analogy. When practicing patience, it is like the earth in enduring both favorable and unfavorable circumstances without moving. Therefore, digging a deep valley does not cause anger, building a lofty hall does not cause love, encountering myriad things all carries them, and the use of virtue becomes greater.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a24_14']	掘擾發於甘泉，種蒔竟無希賚，故行三忍標以地名。	掘擾發於甘泉，種蒔竟無希賚，故行三忍標以地名。	09a	Digging and stirring up sweet springs, planting and ending without hoping for rewards, therefore practicing the three forbearances is marked by the stage name.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a25_10']	熟思熟思，可謂菩薩摩訶薩矣。	熟思熟思，可謂菩薩摩訶薩矣。	09a	Think carefully, think carefully, one can be called a bodhisattva-mahāsattva.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a26_6']	或地是位義，於一切位常行忍故。	或地是位義，於一切位常行忍故。	09a	Or the stage is the meaning of position, always practicing patience in all positions.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a27_11']	經「又復於法至如實相」。	經「又復於法至如實相」。	09a	The sūtra says: Moreover, with regard to the Dharma, up to the true characteristics.

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820a29_14']	行者分別執著之義，於法無所行者，於一切法中唯見眾生及法皆空而不分別。	行者分別執著之義，於法無所行者，於一切法中唯見眾生及法皆空而不分別。	09a	The meaning of the practitioner's discrimination and attachment is to have no activity towards dharmas. Within all dharmas, one only sees sentient beings and dharmas as empty, without discrimination.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b01_11']	執著為有，而觀諸法如實相者，既觀我、法二空為門，復觀諸法如來藏性。	執著為有，而觀諸法如實相者，既觀我、法二空為門，復觀諸法如來藏性。	09a	Attaching to existence and contemplating the true characteristics of dharmas, having already contemplated the two emptinesses of self and dharmas as the gateway, one further contemplates the nature of the tathāgatagarbha within all dharmas.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b03_2']	法之真理如實體相，我法體無名之為空，其如來藏名為空性。	法之真理如實體相，我法體無名之為空，其如來藏名為空性。	09a	The true principle and essence of dharmas is the true nature of the characteristics of the essence. The self and dharmas are devoid of essence, which is called emptiness. The tathāgatagarbha is called the nature of emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b04_4']	不觀二空門，不見空真性，故此二種同名空觀。	不觀二空門，不見空真性，故此二種同名空觀。	09a	Not contemplating the two emptinesses as the gateway, one does not see the true nature of emptiness. Therefore, these two kinds are both called the contemplation of emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b05_9']	經「亦不行不分別」。	經「亦不行不分別」。	09a	The sūtra says: Also, do not practice and do not discriminate.

['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b08_11']	上來所觀空有，恐滯空有之中，故今雙觀拂，謂雖觀空而亦不行滯著空中，謂雖觀有而不分別滯著有中，應俱無住而明觀法。	上來所觀空有，恐滯空有之中，故今雙觀拂，謂雖觀空而亦不行滯著空中，謂雖觀有而不分別滯著有中，應俱無住而明觀法。	09a	The emptiness and existence contemplated above may lead to being stuck in emptiness or existence, so now both are contemplated and brushed away. This means that although one contemplates emptiness, one also does not practice or become attached to emptiness. Although one contemplates existence, one does not discriminate or become attached to existence. One should be without abiding in either, and clearly contemplate the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b10_14']	若有所住者則為非住，故下頌雖依人法二空解此二種，總是於法而無所行攝，於理無違。	若有所住者則為非住，故下頌雖依人法二空解此二種，總是於法而無所行攝，於理無違。	09a	If there is something to abide in, then it is not abiding. Therefore, although the lower verse relies on the two kinds of emptiness of person and dharmas, this is all included in the phrase not practicing with regard to dharmas, and there is no contradiction in principle.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b12_5']	又復於法無所行觀諸法空，頌言不行上中下法，有為無為故。	又復於法無所行觀諸法空，頌言不行上中下法，有為無為故。	09a	Moreover, in the phrase not practicing with regard to dharmas, observing dharmas as empty, the verse says not practicing superior, middling, and inferior dharmas, conditioned or unconditioned.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b14_4']	亦不行不分別，如次不行我、我所執，觀眾生為空，頌言亦不分別是男是女等。	亦不行不分別，如次不行我、我所執，觀眾生為空，頌言亦不分別是男是女等。	09a	Also, in the phrase not practicing and not discriminating, one does not practice and discriminate the grasping of self and what belongs to self, observing sentient beings as empty. The verse says also not discriminating male or female, etc.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b15_4']	由觀此二我、法為空，便證二空如實之性。	由觀此二我、法為空，便證二空如實之性。	09a	By observing these two as empty of self and dharmas, one then realizes the true nature of the two kinds of emptiness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b16_8']	又於法無所行者，謂不行所說法中唯觀實相真如。	又於法無所行者，謂不行所說法中唯觀實相真如。	09a	Moreover, in the phrase not practicing with regard to dharmas, it means not practicing within the taught dharmas, only observing the true characteristics of suchness.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b17_2']	亦不行者，不行我能說中。	亦不行者，不行我能說中。	09a	Also, in the phrase not practicing, it means not practicing within the one who is able to teach.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b18_15']	亦不分別所授化者，即觀三事法、人二種體性為空，而觀真如實相為有。	亦不分別所授化者，即觀三事法、人二種體性為空，而觀真如實相為有。	09a	Also, not discriminating those who are taught to be transformed, one observes the three things, the dharmas and persons, as having the nature of emptiness, while observing suchness and the true characteristics as existent.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b19_4']	又一切法有二：	又一切法有二：	09a	Moreover, all dharmas are twofold:
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b19_10']	一妄、二真。	一妄、二真。	09a	First, false; second, true.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b20_4']	於諸妄法應無所行，捨諸妄故；	於諸妄法應無所行，捨諸妄故；	09a	One should have no practice regarding false dharmas, because one abandons all falsehood;
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b21_1']	於法真性應常觀察，求證達故。	於法真性應常觀察，求證達故。	09a	One should always contemplate the true nature of dharmas, because one seeks to realize it.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b22_1']	雖作此行，亦不作真智行，於實相為有；	雖作此行，亦不作真智行，於實相為有；	09a	Although one engages in such practices, one does not engage in the practice of true wisdom, because in reality there is something;
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b22_14']	亦不作俗智行，於分別為空。	亦不作俗智行，於分別為空。	09a	One also does not engage in the practice of conventional wisdom, because in discrimination it is empty.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b23_14']	故《般若》云「應無所行而行」，是名為行。	故《般若》云「應無所行而行」，是名為行。	09a	Therefore, the Prajnaparamita Sutra says: One should practice without practicing. This is called practice.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b26_3']	不行故無所不行，不分別故無所不分別，不行不分別故妄幻皆除，無所不行不分別故真際咸達。	不行故無所不行，不分別故無所不分別，不行不分別故妄幻皆除，無所不行不分別故真際咸達。	09a	Because of non-practice, there is nothing not practiced; because of non-discrimination, there is nothing not discriminated. Because of non-practice and non-discrimination, false illusions are all removed. Because of nothing not practiced and nothing not discriminated, one thoroughly penetrates the ultimate reality.
['ZH_T34_1723_09a:0820b28_4']	由此雙修照辨一切，於事依他住忍地等，於理成實觀如實相，所執人、法皆照為空。	由此雙修照辨一切，於事依他住忍地等，於理成實觀如實相，所執人、法皆照為空。	09a	Based on this, one cultivates both illumination and discernment of all things. Abiding in the stage of patience in the dependent arising of events, etc., in principle, one contemplates the true reality as it is, and illuminates the emptiness of the grasped person and dharmas.
