['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160b21_10']	此識為一切識因故，是諸識根本。	此識為一切識因故，是諸識根本。	Because this consciousness is the cause of all consciousnesses, it is the fundamental consciousness of all consciousnesses.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c04_1']	於無餘涅槃前，此陰不盡，故名窮生死陰。	於無餘涅槃前，此陰不盡，故名窮生死陰。	Before nirvāṇa without remainder, this aggregate is not exhausted, and is therefore called the aggregate that extends to the end of saṃsāra.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c06_10']	釋曰：	釋曰：	The commentary says:🔽Here, the ālaya consciousness is the basis of the various defiled dharmas.

It is called the fundamental consciousness because it is the root of the various consciousnesses.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c15_1']	本識亦爾，直無歧，譬定無疑。	本識亦爾，直無歧，譬定無疑。	The fundamental consciousness is also like this. It is straight without forks, which is analogous to being certain without doubt.
['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c15_14']	廣平熟，譬大小乘俱弘此義。	廣平熟，譬大小乘俱弘此義。	It is wide and flat, which is analogous to the fact that both the Mahayana and Hinayana extensively propagate this meaning.
['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c16_15']	光明無障，譬引無量道理以證此識，故譬王路。	光明無障，譬引無量道理以證此識，故譬王路。	It is brightly lit without obstructions, which is analogous to using innumerable reasonings to prove this consciousness, and thus it is likened to a royal road.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c20_8']	小乘云阿梨耶識、阿陀那識，由自僻執，於同義異名中立為異義。	小乘云阿梨耶識、阿陀那識，由自僻執，於同義異名中立為異義。	The Lesser Vehicle says that the store consciousness and the appropriating consciousness, due to their own biased attachments, establish different meanings within the same meaning and different names.
['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c20_13']	此說不然。	此說不然。	This is said to be not so.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c24_1']	小乘中立意及識名義俱異，能了別名識，若了別已謝能為後識生方便名為意故。	小乘中立意及識名義俱異，能了別名識，若了別已謝能為後識生方便名為意故。	In the Lesser Vehicle, the names intention and consciousness are established with both different meanings and different names, because that which is able to discriminate is called consciousness, and that which, after having discriminated, is able to serve as the expedient means for the arising of subsequent consciousnesses is called intention.
['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c24_16']	識以了別為義，意以生方便為義。	識以了別為義，意以生方便為義。	Therefore, consciousness has the meaning of discrimination, while intention has the meaning of expedient means.
['ZH_T31_1595_002:0160c26_9']	如小乘中二名有二義，本識有體無名，故知心名應目本識，此義不可違。	如小乘中二名有二義，本識有體無名，故知心名應目本識，此義不可違。	Just as in the Lesser Vehicle, the two names have two meanings, the fundamental consciousness has substance but no name. Therefore, one should know that the name mind refers to the fundamental consciousness, and this meaning cannot be violated.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0161a03_18']	或執是五取陰，取是貪愛別名，貪愛所緣自五陰名為取陰。	或執是五取陰，取是貪愛別名，貪愛所緣自五陰名為取陰。	Some hold that the five appropriated aggregates are the appropriated aggregates, where appropriation is a synonym for craving, and the five aggregates that are the objects of craving are called the appropriated aggregates.
['ZH_T31_1595_002:0161a04_16']	此取陰是眾生愛著處故，說名阿梨耶。	此取陰是眾生愛著處故，說名阿梨耶。	Because these appropriated aggregates are the place where sentient beings are attached, they are called ālaya.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0161a08_19']	是故於樂受中，由欲顛倒心未滅故，此樂受是愛著處。	是故於樂受中，由欲顛倒心未滅故，此樂受是愛著處。	Therefore, in pleasant feeling, because the mind that is erroneously attached to desire has not yet been extinguished, this pleasant feeling is the basis of attachment.
['ZH_T31_1595_002:0161a10_8']	五陰與樂受相應故，說五取陰為愛著處，是故樂受正為愛著處。	五陰與樂受相應故，說五取陰為愛著處，是故樂受正為愛著處。	Because the five aggregates are associated with pleasant feeling, the five appropriated aggregates are said to be the basis of attachment. Therefore, pleasant feeling is the basis of attachment.

['ZH_T31_1595_002:0161a13_14']	此受由能安樂自我，愛自我故愛此樂受。	此受由能安樂自我，愛自我故愛此樂受。	Because this feeling brings happiness to the self, one loves the self and therefore loves this pleasant feeling.

Because these scriptures do not decisively determine the meaning of this consciousness, one is deluded about this consciousness based on the scriptures.
