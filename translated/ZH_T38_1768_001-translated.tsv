Some clarify the meaning of opening the way, like when a country's territory has obstacles and the outlying areas have not yet submitted, in order to expand the territory and bring assistance, it first needs to cut down, and then the army can be deployed.

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b18_6']	特由眾生虛妄，執文求實，聞名仍不見其真，或云涅槃是有，或意是無，或言二諦所攝，或意出二諦之外，或意出生死無常，或意涅槃常住，因此謬造種種異計，便成繫縛，致有生死。	特由眾生虛妄，執文求實，聞名仍不見其真，或云涅槃是有，或意是無，或言二諦所攝，或意出二諦之外，或意出生死無常，或意涅槃常住，因此謬造種種異計，便成繫縛，致有生死。	001	It is just because sentient beings are deluded, grasping at the text to seek the truth, hearing the name but still not seeing its reality, some say nirvana exists, some think it does not exist, some say it is included in the two truths, some think it is outside the two truths, some think it arises from impermanence in birth and death, some think nirvana is permanent, because of this they mistakenly create various different theories, which then become bonds, resulting in birth and death.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b19_12']	前諸佛菩薩為引此妄情假說涅槃，為出處方便空假立名。	前諸佛菩薩為引此妄情假說涅槃，為出處方便空假立名。	001	Previously, buddhas and bodhisattvas, in order to guide these deluded emotions, provisionally spoke of nirvana as a means of escape, provisionally establishing the name of emptiness.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b20_2']	名無得物，物無應名。	名無得物，物無應名。	001	The name cannot obtain the object, the object cannot correspond to the name.

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b23_1']	所以生死涅槃本無二相，但為化此虛妄，如度虛空，實無眾生得滅度者，如此了悟名得涅槃，實無涅槃可得。	所以生死涅槃本無二相，但為化此虛妄，如度虛空，實無眾生得滅度者，如此了悟名得涅槃，實無涅槃可得。	001	Therefore, birth and death and nirvana originally have no two characteristics. It is just to transform this delusion, like crossing through empty space, truly no sentient beings attain liberation. If one awakens to this, it is called attaining nirvana, but truly there is no nirvana to be attained.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b24_14']	但約此迷悟說凡說聖，假名生死強稱涅槃，令改凡成聖，捨生死得涅槃。	但約此迷悟說凡說聖，假名生死強稱涅槃，令改凡成聖，捨生死得涅槃。	001	But based on this delusion and enlightenment, we speak of ordinary and holy, provisionally name birth and death, and strongly refer to nirvana, causing one to change from ordinary to holy, abandon birth and death, and attain nirvana.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b26_14']	既悟此本來不二、亦復不一，若於凡聖、生死、涅槃作一異解者，則障正道，名為「據語」。	既悟此本來不二、亦復不一，若於凡聖、生死、涅槃作一異解者，則障正道，名為「據語」。	001	Once enlightened to this original non-duality and also non-unity, if one has the understanding of oneness or difference regarding ordinary and holy, birth and death, and nirvana, then it obstructs the right path and is called relying on words.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b27_6']	今破此一異等見，名為「開道」。	今破此一異等見，名為「開道」。	001	Now, refuting this view of oneness or difference, etc., is called opening the path.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b27_18']	約智開復，有何道可開耶？	約智開復，有何道可開耶？	001	In terms of the opening of wisdom, what path is there to open?
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230b29_1']	從來云如來之身非凡是聖，是聖涅槃之法，是常非無常。	從來云如來之身非凡是聖，是聖涅槃之法，是常非無常。	001	From the beginning, it has been said that the body of the Tathāgata is not ordinary but holy, and this holy dharma of nirvana is permanent and not impermanent.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c02_3']	今為對此故，明如來之身非凡非聖，凡聖悉是如來善巧，涅槃非常無常，常無常皆涅槃方便。	今為對此故，明如來之身非凡非聖，凡聖悉是如來善巧，涅槃非常無常，常無常皆涅槃方便。	001	Now, in response to this, it is clarified that the body of the Tathāgata is neither ordinary nor holy. Ordinary and holy are all skillful means of the Tathāgata. Nirvana is neither permanent nor impermanent. Permanence and impermanence are both skillful means of nirvana.

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c02_19']	常病重故，設無常之藥。	常病重故，設無常之藥。	001	Because the illness of permanence is severe, the medicine of impermanence is prescribed.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c04_13']	眾生執有為涅槃故設無，身心皆盡乃為妙極，物情不了便謂佛身無涅槃斷滅。	眾生執有為涅槃故設無，身心皆盡乃為妙極，物情不了便謂佛身無涅槃斷滅。	001	Because sentient beings cling to conditioned nirvāṇa, it is established as unconditioned. The complete exhaustion of body and mind is considered the ultimate subtlety. Ordinary beings do not understand and think that the Buddha's body has no nirvāṇa and is annihilated.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c04_17']	故經云：	故經云：	001	Therefore, the sūtra says:
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c05_13']	其復不久，王復得病，須服乳藥。	其復不久，王復得病，須服乳藥。	001	Not long after, the king fell ill again and needed to take milk medicine.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c06_16']	故今教為對無常故設常住，則左右除病，迭代破執。	故今教為對無常故設常住，則左右除病，迭代破執。	001	Therefore, the present teaching is established to counter impermanence, and permanence is established. Then, left and right remove the illness, and the attachment is broken in turn.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c07_6']	執病若盡，在藥皆除。	執病若盡，在藥皆除。	001	If the illness of attachment is exhausted, the medicine is also removed.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c07_15']	涅槃之法竟何所有？	涅槃之法竟何所有？	001	What is the nature of nirvāṇa?
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c08_15']	雖無所有而無所不有，雖無所不有而無所有。	雖無所有而無所不有，雖無所不有而無所有。	001	Although it has no existence, it is not nonexistent. Although it is not nonexistent, it has no existence.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c09_20']	有無既爾，常無常亦然，非常非無常，常無常具足也。	有無既爾，常無常亦然，非常非無常，常無常具足也。	001	Since existence and nonexistence are like this, permanence and impermanence are also so. Neither permanent nor impermanent is the perfection of permanence and impermanence.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c10_10']	大師於此明四雙八隻義：	大師於此明四雙八隻義：	001	The Great Master clarifies the meaning of four pairs and eight individuals here:
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c11_7']	一凡聖，二常無常，三隱顯，四半滿。	一凡聖，二常無常，三隱顯，四半滿。	001	1. Ordinary beings and sages, 2. Permanence and impermanence, 3. Concealment and revelation, 4. Partial and complete.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c13_13']	言凡聖者，涅槃實不開凡聖，但住大涅槃能建大義，或時為凡，或時化聖。	言凡聖者，涅槃實不開凡聖，但住大涅槃能建大義，或時為凡，或時化聖。	001	As for the terms ordinary and sage, nirvana does not actually distinguish between ordinary and sage, but those who abide in great nirvana can establish great meaning, sometimes manifesting as ordinary and sometimes manifesting as sage.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c14_11']	故佛初出世間同凡夫事，雖同凡而異解。	故佛初出世間同凡夫事，雖同凡而異解。	001	Therefore, when the Buddha first appeared in the world, he engaged in activities common to ordinary people. Although the same as ordinary people, his understanding was different.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c15_4']	凡初生則行諸方七步，云：	凡初生則行諸方七步，云：	001	Ordinary people, upon birth, walk in the four directions for seven steps and say:

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c17_15']	」此言已障是聖，但說此言已，更為嬰兒；	」此言已障是聖，但說此言已，更為嬰兒；	001	These words already reveal that he is a sage, but after speaking these words, he further acts like an infant;
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c18_15']	乃至槃馬、捔力等，具同凡事，此則以凡覆聖。	乃至槃馬、捔力等，具同凡事，此則以凡覆聖。	001	up to the horse race and other events, he fully engages in activities common to ordinary people. This is using the ordinary to conceal the sage.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c20_1']	今日教起明久已，聖人方便便現為此事，則是以聖開凡。	今日教起明久已，聖人方便便現為此事，則是以聖開凡。	001	The teachings that arose today have long been clear. The sage skillfully manifests in these events, which is using the sage to reveal the ordinary.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c20_11']	開覆之義，具通今昔。	開覆之義，具通今昔。	001	The meanings of revealing and concealing are fully applicable to both the past and present.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c21_2']	昔開凡覆聖，今開聖覆凡。	昔開凡覆聖，今開聖覆凡。	001	In the past, the ordinary was revealed and the sage was concealed. In the present, the sage is revealed and the ordinary is concealed.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c21_11']	但昔覆名，今開稱。	但昔覆名，今開稱。	001	But in the past it was concealed, now it is revealed.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c22_18']	所以爾者，初為緣未堪，不得說是聖，但得說是凡，則凡覆聖。	所以爾者，初為緣未堪，不得說是聖，但得說是凡，則凡覆聖。	001	The reason for this is that initially the conditions were not yet sufficient, so it could not be said to be holy, but only ordinary. Then the ordinary concealed the holy.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0230c23_3']	今始得說道：	今始得說道：	001	Now it is finally possible to say:

In the past, it was originally holy, but due to conditions not yet sufficient, it could not be said to be holy, but only ordinary. The holy path was concealed and could not be called revealed. How could there be a separate holy one to be concealed?

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0231a07_19']	昔說「無常」不為「無常」，昔說「無常」為開。	昔說「無常」不為「無常」，昔說「無常」為開。	001	In the past, speaking of impermanence was not for impermanence. Speaking of impermanence in the past was an opening.

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0236c29_1']	又且法身亦得為用，豈謂智斷偏為用耶？	又且法身亦得為用，豈謂智斷偏為用耶？	001	Moreover, the Dharma body can also be taken as the function, so how can it be said that wisdom and severance are biased towards being the function?
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0237a02_11']	若云身是體異名，故以法身當體者，下文云「涅槃名解脫」，應以解脫當名，而今不以解脫者，當那忽以法身當解。	若云身是體異名，故以法身當體者，下文云「涅槃名解脫」，應以解脫當名，而今不以解脫者，當那忽以法身當解。	001	If it is said that the body is a different name for the essence, and therefore the Dharma body should be taken as the essence, then the text below says nirvana is called liberation, so it should take liberation as the name, but now it does not take liberation, so how can it suddenly take the Dharma body as liberation?
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0237a04_5']	二者、文中自道縱亦不成，別異亦不成，三法曾無縱橫之異，豈有體用之殊？	二者、文中自道縱亦不成，別異亦不成，三法曾無縱橫之異，豈有體用之殊？	001	Second, the text itself says that even if it is allowed, it is not established, and if they are separate, it is also not established. The three dharmas have never had the difference of being extended or crossed, so how can there be the distinction of essence and function?
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0237a04_14']	若有體用，有本末；	若有體用，有本末；	001	If there is essence and function, there is root and branch;

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0237a09_17']	今破二涅槃明二德，又以法身般若斥無餘者，亦應以解脫常住斥彼有餘，何者昔日有餘，何但解脫未足，亦非常住？	今破二涅槃明二德，又以法身般若斥無餘者，亦應以解脫常住斥彼有餘，何者昔日有餘，何但解脫未足，亦非常住？	001	Now, refuting the two nirvanas and clarifying the two virtues, and using the Dharma body and prajña to criticize the remainderless, one should also use the permanence of liberation to criticize the remainder. Why? In the past, what was the remainder? Not only was liberation insufficient, it was also not permanent.
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0237a11_4']	今若正言解脫，不言常住者，亦應無餘，正言法身，不言般若。	今若正言解脫，不言常住者，亦應無餘，正言法身，不言般若。	001	Now, if one speaks of liberation but not permanence, one should also speak of the Dharma body but not prajña.

Because there is no realm that is not illuminated, it is called prajña. Because there is no affliction that is not exhausted, it is called liberation.

['ZH_T38_1768_001:0237a19_5']	又，為對生死三障明涅槃三德：	又，為對生死三障明涅槃三德：	001	Moreover, it is in contrast to the three obstacles of birth and death to clarify the three virtues of nirvāṇa:
['ZH_T38_1768_001:0237a21_3']	對報障明法身，對業障明解脫，對煩惱障明般若──生死只三障，故涅槃唯有三德也。	對報障明法身，對業障明解脫，對煩惱障明般若──生死只三障，故涅槃唯有三德也。	001	In contrast to the obstacle of retribution, it clarifies the Dharma body; in contrast to the obstacle of karma, it clarifies liberation; in contrast to the obstacle of afflictions, it clarifies prajñā.
