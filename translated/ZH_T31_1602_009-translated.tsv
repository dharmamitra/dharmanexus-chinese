['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c17_3']	若已生相者，則果體已生，復從因生，不應道理。	若已生相者，則果體已生，復從因生，不應道理。	009	If it is the arisen characteristic, then the essence of the effect has already arisen, and to say it arises again from a cause is not reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c18_3']	是故因中非先有果，然要有因故待緣而生。	是故因中非先有果，然要有因故待緣而生。	009	Therefore, the effect does not exist prior to the cause, but because there must be a cause, it arises in dependence on conditions.

['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c23_2']	四於自作業可得了知。	四於自作業可得了知。	009	Fourth, they can be understood in terms of their own function.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c24_3']	五由因變故果變可得，或由緣變故果變可得。	五由因變故果變可得，或由緣變故果變可得。	009	Fifth, the change in the effect can be obtained due to the change in the cause, or the change in the effect can be obtained due to the change in the conditions.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c25_1']	是故常時恒時說因中有果，不應道理。	是故常時恒時說因中有果，不應道理。	009	Therefore, it is unreasonable to say that the effect exists in the cause at all times.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c25_15']	由此義故，彼所立論非如理說。	由此義故，彼所立論非如理說。	009	For this reason, their established thesis is not spoken of in accordance with reason.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c26_19']	謂不異相故、異相故、不生相故、生相故，不應道理。	謂不異相故、異相故、不生相故、生相故，不應道理。	009	Namely, it is unreasonable because of the characteristic of non-difference, the characteristic of difference, the characteristic of non-arising, and the characteristic of arising.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c28_8']	從緣顯了論者，謂如有一，若沙門若婆羅門，起如是見立如是論：	從緣顯了論者，謂如有一，若沙門若婆羅門，起如是見立如是論：	009	As for the theory of manifestation from conditions, it refers to a case where a śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa gives rise to such a view and establishes such a theory:
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0521c29_7']	一切諸法體自本有，從眾緣顯非緣所生。	一切諸法體自本有，從眾緣顯非緣所生。	009	All dharmas inherently exist by themselves, and are manifested from various conditions, not produced by conditions.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a01_8']	謂即因中有果論者及聲相論者，作如是計。	謂即因中有果論者及聲相論者，作如是計。	009	This refers to the theory of the existence of effects within causes and the theory of the characteristics of sound, which make such speculations.

['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a03_14']	由教及理故。	由教及理故。	009	Because of teachings and principles.

['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a05_21']	果先是有，復從因生，不應道理。	果先是有，復從因生，不應道理。	009	If the effect already exists, it should not be produced from causes again.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a06_18']	然非不用功為成於果，復以何緣而作功用？	然非不用功為成於果，復以何緣而作功用？	009	However, it is not the case that effort is not needed to accomplish the effect. For what other reason would one make effort?
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a07_8']	豈非唯為顯了果故。	豈非唯為顯了果故。	009	Isn't it just for the sake of manifesting the effect?

['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a10_3']	為無障緣故障、為有障緣故障？	為無障緣故障、為有障緣故障？	009	Is the obstacle due to unobstructed conditions, or is the obstacle due to obstructed conditions?
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a11_1']	若無者，無有障緣而有障者，不應道理。	若無者，無有障緣而有障者，不應道理。	009	If it is the former, it would not make sense for there to be an obstacle without an obstructing condition.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a11_14']	若有者，屬果之因何故不障？	若有者，屬果之因何故不障？	009	If it is the latter, why does the cause that belongs to the effect not obstruct it?
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a11_19']	同是有故。	同是有故。	009	Because they are both existent.

['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a14_9']	若言亦障因者，亦應顯了俱是所障，而但顯因中先有果性而不顯因，不應道理。	若言亦障因者，亦應顯了俱是所障，而但顯因中先有果性而不顯因，不應道理。	009	If you say that the cause is also obstructed, then both the cause and the effect should be what is obstructed, but you only manifest the nature of the effect that already exists in the cause and do not manifest the cause, which does not make sense.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a15_18']	汝又應說，為有性是障緣、為果性是障緣？	汝又應說，為有性是障緣、為果性是障緣？	009	You should also explain whether existence is the obstructing condition or the nature of the effect is the obstructing condition.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a17_1']	若有性是障緣者，是則有性常不顯了，不應道理。	若有性是障緣者，是則有性常不顯了，不應道理。	009	If existence is the obstructing condition, then existence would always be unmanifest, which does not make sense.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a17_14']	又因亦是有，何故不是障緣？	又因亦是有，何故不是障緣？	009	Moreover, since the cause also exists, why is it not the obstructing condition?
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a19_19']	若果性是障緣者，如是一法亦因亦果，如芽是種子果，是莖等因，是即一法，亦顯不顯，不應道理。	若果性是障緣者，如是一法亦因亦果，如芽是種子果，是莖等因，是即一法，亦顯不顯，不應道理。	009	If the nature of the effect is the condition of obstruction, then such a single dharma would be both cause and effect. For example, a sprout is the effect of a seed, but it is the cause of the stem and so on. This would mean that a single dharma would both manifest and not manifest, which is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a20_9']	又今問汝，隨汝意答。	又今問汝，隨汝意答。	009	Moreover, I now ask you to answer as you wish.

['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a21_20']	若言一者，彼本有法常顯，已顯復顯，不應道理。	若言一者，彼本有法常顯，已顯復顯，不應道理。	009	If you say it is the same, then the fundamental dharma would always be manifest, and what has already been manifested would be manifested again, which is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a22_11']	若言異者，此顯為無因耶？	若言異者，此顯為無因耶？	009	If you say it is different, is this manifestation without a cause?
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a22_16']	為有因耶？	為有因耶？	009	Or does it have a cause?
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a23_11']	若無因者，無因而顯，不應道理。	若無因者，無因而顯，不應道理。	009	If it is without a cause, manifesting without a cause is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a24_20']	若有因者，果性可顯，非是因性，不顯之因能顯於果，不應道理。	若有因者，果性可顯，非是因性，不顯之因能顯於果，不應道理。	009	If it has a cause, then the nature of the effect can be manifested, but the nature of the cause cannot be manifested. The unmanifested cause being able to manifest the effect is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a26_13']	如是無障緣故、有障緣故、有相故、果相故、顯了一故、顯了異故，不應道理。	如是無障緣故、有障緣故、有相故、果相故、顯了一故、顯了異故，不應道理。	009	Thus, because of the absence of unobstructed conditions, the presence of obstructed conditions, the presence of characteristics, the characteristics of effects, the manifestation of understanding, and the difference in manifestation, it is unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522a29_1']	是故汝言，若法性無是則無相、若法性有是則有相，若性是無不可顯了、若性是有則可顯了者，不應道理。	是故汝言，若法性無是則無相、若法性有是則有相，若性是無不可顯了、若性是有則可顯了者，不應道理。	009	Therefore, your statement that if the nature of dharmas is nonexistent, then there are no characteristics, and if the nature of dharmas is existent, then there are characteristics, and if the nature is nonexistent, it cannot be manifested, and if the nature is existent, then it can be manifested, is not reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1602_009:0522b04_18']	今當略說，雖實是有而不可取相，或有遠故不可取、或由四種障因之所障故不可取、或極微細故不可取、或心散亂故不可取、或根損壞故不可取、或未得彼相應智故不可取。	今當略說，雖實是有而不可取相，或有遠故不可取、或由四種障因之所障故不可取、或極微細故不可取、或心散亂故不可取、或根損壞故不可取、或未得彼相應智故不可取。	009	Now I will briefly explain. Although it is actually existent, it cannot be grasped as a characteristic. It may be unobtainable because it is distant, or it may be unobtainable because it is obstructed by the four kinds of obstacles, or it may be unobtainable because it is extremely subtle, or it may be unobtainable because the mind is distracted, or it may be unobtainable because the faculties are impaired, or it may be unobtainable because one has not yet attained the corresponding knowledge.
