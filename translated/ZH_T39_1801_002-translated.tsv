['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c11_2']	一，旋，即旋假入空；	一，旋，即旋假入空；	First, revolving, which means revolving from the provisional to enter emptiness;
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c11_21']	二，百千萬億旋，即從空入假，旋轉分別；	二，百千萬億旋，即從空入假，旋轉分別；	Second, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of revolutions, which means revolving from emptiness to enter the provisional, to distinguish and analyze;
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c13_14']	三法音方便，即是二觀方便，得入中道解一切言音，亦能一音說法隨類各解。	三法音方便，即是二觀方便，得入中道解一切言音，亦能一音說法隨類各解。	Third, skillful means of the sounds of the Dharma, which refers to the skillful means of the two contemplations, to enter the middle way and understand all sounds, and also to expound the Dharma with one sound, so that each being understands according to their kind.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c15_2']	得此三者，即入無礙陀羅尼，具足一切陀羅尼，故云第一也。	得此三者，即入無礙陀羅尼，具足一切陀羅尼，故云第一也。	Obtaining these three is to enter the unobstructed dhāraṇī, and to be fully endowed with all dhāraṇīs, so it is called the foremost.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c15_17']	「三昧」，或三摩提，此云正定。	「三昧」，或三摩提，此云正定。	Samādhi or samāpatti means right concentration.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c17_1']	「王三昧」者，即首楞嚴等百八三昧，皆中道一心，名王三昧也。	「王三昧」者，即首楞嚴等百八三昧，皆中道一心，名王三昧也。	King samādhi refers to the one hundred and eight samādhis such as the śūraṃgama, all of which are the middle way and one mind, called the king samādhi.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c18_4']	然陀羅尼是慧性、三昧是定性，不二而二，故分二別。	然陀羅尼是慧性、三昧是定性，不二而二，故分二別。	However, dhāraṇī is the nature of wisdom, and samādhi is the nature of concentration. They are non-dual but are divided into two.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c18_19']	因中修一心止觀，果上證此二法。	因中修一心止觀，果上證此二法。	Cultivating the single-minded cessation and contemplation in the cause, one realizes these two dharmas in the fruition.

['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c22_17']	又引王三昧者，意明此慧即定，不二而二、二而不二耳。	又引王三昧者，意明此慧即定，不二而二、二而不二耳。	Moreover, citing the king samādhi, the meaning is to clarify that this wisdom is concentration, non-dual but dual, dual but non-dual.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c24_7']	「遮三障」等者，以遮惡不起，是消除義，故經云「消除三障無諸惡」。	「遮三障」等者，以遮惡不起，是消除義，故經云「消除三障無諸惡」。	Preventing the three obstacles and so on, since preventing evil from arising is the meaning of elimination, the sūtra says, Eliminating the three obstacles, having no evil.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c25_9']	持善不失，是調伏義，故經云「五眼具足成菩提」。	持善不失，是調伏義，故經云「五眼具足成菩提」。	Upholding goodness without loss is the meaning of taming, therefore the sūtra says the five eyes are complete and accomplish enlightenment.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c26_2']	「呪即是願」者，即解經題呪字義。	「呪即是願」者，即解經題呪字義。	The dhāraṇī is the same as a vow means explaining the meaning of the word dhāraṇī in the sūtra title.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c27_10']	謂大聖說此陀羅尼，只是呪願眾生如佛，譬若蒲盧呪螟蛉也。	謂大聖說此陀羅尼，只是呪願眾生如佛，譬若蒲盧呪螟蛉也。	It means that the Great Sage speaks this dhāraṇī, which is simply a vow for sentient beings to be like the Buddha, just like the spell of the cicada on the maggot.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c29_2']	然則陀羅尼既是梵語，呪字即當華言，經題華梵雙舉，故云陀羅尼呪。	然則陀羅尼既是梵語，呪字即當華言，經題華梵雙舉，故云陀羅尼呪。	Then, since the dhāraṇī is an Indian language, and the word spell is a Chinese word, the sūtra title mentions both Indian and Chinese, therefore it is called Dhāraṇī Spell.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c29_16']	若爾，何故云陀羅尼翻遮持耶？	若爾，何故云陀羅尼翻遮持耶？	If that is so, why is it said that the dhāraṇī is translated as blocking and upholding?
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0983c29_18']	答：	答：	The answer is:
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a01_5']	古人見祕密不譯。	古人見祕密不譯。	Ancient people saw that the secret [teachings] were not to be translated.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a02_11']	例如此土禁呪等法，便以呪名往翻，然亦不失遮持之義。	例如此土禁呪等法，便以呪名往翻，然亦不失遮持之義。	As an example, like the spells and other methods prohibited in this land, they used the word spell to translate [the dhāraṇī], but it also does not lose the meaning of blocking and upholding.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a02_14']	何者？	何者？	Why is that?
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a04_15']	呪既訓願，如菩薩四願，二願拔苦即遮惡義、二願與樂即持善義，故知呪與遮持義歸一揆。	呪既訓願，如菩薩四願，二願拔苦即遮惡義、二願與樂即持善義，故知呪與遮持義歸一揆。	Since spells are interpreted as vows, like the four vows of a bodhisattva, two vows to eliminate suffering are the meaning of blocking evil, and two vows to bestow happiness are the meaning of upholding goodness, therefore it is known that the meaning of spells and blocking and upholding returns to the same principle.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a06_11']	「經者教也」者，謂經即言教，訓法、訓常，有翻無翻俱指舊釋，即古來人師解義也。	「經者教也」者，謂經即言教，訓法、訓常，有翻無翻俱指舊釋，即古來人師解義也。	The sutra is the teaching means that the sutra is the spoken teaching, which instructs the Dharma and is eternal. Whether translated or not, it refers to the old explanations, which are the interpretations of the ancient masters.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a07_12']	今唯訓教，則四教俱經，言略意周，不竢餘說。	今唯訓教，則四教俱經，言略意周，不竢餘說。	Now, if it is only interpreted as teaching, then all four teachings are sutras. The meaning is complete in the brief statement, without needing other explanations.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a08_3']	「餘疏」，即指《普門玄義》也。	「餘疏」，即指《普門玄義》也。	Other commentaries refers to the Profound Meaning of the Universal Gate.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a09_1']	然雖指彼，不無小異，辨體不同已如前記。	然雖指彼，不無小異，辨體不同已如前記。	Although it refers to that, there are still slight differences. The difference in the explanation of the essence is already recorded above.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a10_15']	又彼此雖俱感應為宗，彼是《法華》，正約圓機感於圓應，雖明三教，意在開權；	又彼此雖俱感應為宗，彼是《法華》，正約圓機感於圓應，雖明三教，意在開權；	Moreover, although both take sympathetic response as the main principle, that is the Lotus Sutra, which is about the perfect capacity responding to the perfect response. Although it clarifies the three teachings, the intention is in revealing the provisional.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a11_4']	今經方等，帶偏明矣。	今經方等，帶偏明矣。	This sutra is Vaipulya, and the biased is already clear.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a12_4']	彼明普門示現，乃以慈悲為用，則與拔雙明；	彼明普門示現，乃以慈悲為用，則與拔雙明；	That clarifies the universal gate's manifestations, which takes compassion as its function, clearly illuminating both saving and benefiting.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a13_4']	此顯舍離求救，乃以救危為用，則拔苦為正。	此顯舍離求救，乃以救危為用，則拔苦為正。	This shows seeking salvation in Shali, which takes saving from danger as its function, taking saving from suffering as the main point.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a14_13']	彼明教相即偏而圓，此明教相偏圓相隔，宜在區別，無得雷同。	彼明教相即偏而圓，此明教相偏圓相隔，宜在區別，無得雷同。	The characteristics of the teachings in that text are biased but perfect, while the characteristics of the teachings in this text are biased and perfect, with a clear distinction. It is appropriate to make a distinction, without confusing them.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a18_9']	四義既指餘疏，而復辨感應之宗者，以今經以感應為要，機通十界、應通四教，各備四句其相難知，故此略示四句者，一冥機冥應、二冥機顯應、三顯機顯應、四顯機冥應。	四義既指餘疏，而復辨感應之宗者，以今經以感應為要，機通十界、應通四教，各備四句其相難知，故此略示四句者，一冥機冥應、二冥機顯應、三顯機顯應、四顯機冥應。	Since the four meanings are pointed out in other commentaries, and yet the principle of stimulus and response is still discussed, it is because in this sutra, stimulus and response are essential. The stimulus is common to the ten realms, and the response is common to the four teachings, each with four statements whose characteristics are difficult to know. Therefore, this briefly shows the four statements: 1. The stimulus is hidden and the response is hidden, 2. The stimulus is hidden and the response is manifest, 3. The stimulus is manifest and the response is manifest, 4. The stimulus is manifest and the response is hidden.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a19_14']	若過去善修三業，現在未運身口藉往善力，名為冥機也。	若過去善修三業，現在未運身口藉往善力，名為冥機也。	If in the past one cultivated the three karmas well, and in the present one does not yet use body and speech, but relies on the power of past good deeds, this is called the hidden stimulus.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a21_5']	雖不現見靈應，而密為法身所益，不見不聞而覺而知，是為冥益也。	雖不現見靈應，而密為法身所益，不見不聞而覺而知，是為冥益也。	Although one does not presently see spiritual responses, one is secretly benefited by the Dharma body, without seeing or hearing, yet one is aware and knows, this is the hidden benefit.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a22_19']	二冥機顯應者，過去植善而冥機已成，便得值佛聞法現前獲利，是為顯益。	二冥機顯應者，過去植善而冥機已成，便得值佛聞法現前獲利，是為顯益。	2. The hidden stimulus and manifest response means that in the past one planted goodness and the hidden stimulus was already accomplished, one then gets to meet the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and presently obtains benefits, this is the manifest benefit.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a23_19']	如佛初出世，最初得度之人，現在何甞修行？	如佛初出世，最初得度之人，現在何甞修行？	Like when the Buddha first appeared in the world, the first person to be liberated, what practice did he ever do in the present?
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a24_16']	諸佛照其宿種，自往度之，即其義也。	諸佛照其宿種，自往度之，即其義也。	The Buddhas illuminate his past seeds and go to liberate him, this is the meaning of it.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a26_6']	三顯機顯應者，現前身口精勤而能感降，故月蓋曲躬，聖居門閫。	三顯機顯應者，現前身口精勤而能感降，故月蓋曲躬，聖居門閫。	Third, the manifest stimulus and response means that one can arouse the descent by diligently using body and speech in the present, so the moon-covered one bends his body and the sage dwells at the door threshold.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a27_6']	又如行人道場禮懺，能感靈應，是顯機顯應也。	又如行人道場禮懺，能感靈應，是顯機顯應也。	Also, like a practitioner in the ritual arena who bows and repents, able to arouse spiritual responses, this is the manifest stimulus and response.
['ZH_T39_1801_002:0984a29_1']	四顯機冥應，如人一世勤苦，現善濃積而不顯，感冥有其利，此是顯機冥益。	四顯機冥應，如人一世勤苦，現善濃積而不顯，感冥有其利，此是顯機冥益。	Fourth, the manifest stimulus and obscure response is like a person who diligently practices in one lifetime, accumulating much present goodness without manifesting, secretly benefiting, this is the manifest stimulus and obscure benefit.

This principle is manifested right in these five skandhas, named the five nirvāṇas.
