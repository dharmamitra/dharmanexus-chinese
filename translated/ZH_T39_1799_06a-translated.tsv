Arising is movement. Since the characteristic of movement is lost, stillness also does not arise. This is because movement and stillness are what the ear takes.

These characteristics of the able to hear are the hearing wisdom. The able and the taken are both silent, therefore it is said the hearing of the able to hear is exhausted. This eliminates the hearing wisdom.
