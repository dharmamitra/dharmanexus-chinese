['ZH_T37_1763_008:0410a23_1']	慈之為濟，無制戒律，令不作諸惡、然使行善，以之極也。	慈之為濟，無制戒律，令不作諸惡、然使行善，以之極也。	Compassion's way of saving is not to restrain people from doing evil through the precepts, but to make them do good, which is the ultimate.
['ZH_T37_1763_008:0410a23_18']	既制戒律，有罪必治，即事如似無慈。	既制戒律，有罪必治，即事如似無慈。	Since the precepts have been established, if there is a crime, it must be punished, which seems to be like lacking compassion.

The reason for discussing the power of the sūtra based on the name of the sūtra to ask about liberation is for two meanings:

['ZH_T37_1763_008:0412b05_2']	二者明近遠解脫皆是經力，近則能滅因中三障、遠則能辨果地解脫，是以問言「云何於此經」即是問名問力也，「究竟到彼岸」即是問解脫也。	二者明近遠解脫皆是經力，近則能滅因中三障、遠則能辨果地解脫，是以問言「云何於此經」即是問名問力也，「究竟到彼岸」即是問解脫也。	Second, it clarifies that both proximate and distant liberation are the power of the sūtra. Proximate means it can eliminate the three hindrances in the cause, and distant means it can clarify the liberation of the fruition ground. Therefore, the question How is it in this sūtra? is asking about the name and power of the sūtra. Ultimately reaching the other shore is asking about liberation.
