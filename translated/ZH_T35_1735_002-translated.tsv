['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509b24_0', 'ZH_T35_1735_002:0509b25_0']	唐清涼山大華嚴寺沙門澄觀撰🔽第四立四教者，略有四家：一梁朝光宅法	唐清涼山大華嚴寺沙門澄觀撰 第四立四教者，略有四家：一梁朝光宅法	002	Compiled by Śramaṇa Chengguan of the Great Huayan Monastery on Mount Qingliang in the Tang Dynasty
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509b27_5']	師，依《法華》第二立四乘教，謂臨門三車即是權教三乘；	師，依《法華》第二立四乘教，謂臨門三車即是權教三乘；	002	The fourth is the establishment of four teachings, which can be summarized into four schools: First, the Dharma Master Guangzhai of the Liang Dynasty, based on the second chapter of the Lotus Sutra, established the four teachings of the four vehicles, namely, the three vehicles at the gate are the provisional teachings of the three vehicles;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509b29_14']	四衢等賜即實教大乘，以臨門牛車亦同羊鹿俱不得故、並無體故、諸子皆索故，是知三皆虛指以為方便。	四衢等賜即實教大乘，以臨門牛車亦同羊鹿俱不得故、並無體故、諸子皆索故，是知三皆虛指以為方便。	002	The equal bestowal at the crossroads is the true teaching of the Mahayana. Because the ox cart at the gate is also the same as the sheep and deer, both are not obtained, because they have no substance, and because all the children ask for it, we know that the three are all false indications as skillful means.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c01_14']	此則前三是三乘、後一是一乘，無乖教理。	此則前三是三乘、後一是一乘，無乖教理。	002	This means that the first three are the three vehicles, and the last one is the One Vehicle, without contradicting the teachings and principles.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c04_15']	若唯說《法華》為實，則抑諸《般若》及諸大乘了義之經，是知昔大亦有權實，《法華》但會昔權，故說三皆虛指昔實，不滯方便故不會之。	若唯說《法華》為實，則抑諸《般若》及諸大乘了義之經，是知昔大亦有權實，《法華》但會昔權，故說三皆虛指昔實，不滯方便故不會之。	002	If only the Lotus Sutra is said to be true, then it suppresses all the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras and the Mahayana sutras of definitive meaning. We know that the Mahayana of the past also has provisional and true aspects. The Lotus Sutra only unifies the provisional teachings of the past, so it says that the three are all false indications. The true aspects of the past do not stagnate in skillful means, so it does not unify them.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c05_11']	若約會權歸實，即是會三為一。	若約會權歸實，即是會三為一。	002	If it is about reconciling the provisional and returning to the real, it is reconciling the three into one.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c06_6']	若破小顯大，即是會二歸一。	若破小顯大，即是會二歸一。	002	If it is about breaking the small and revealing the great, it is reconciling the two and returning to one.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c07_3']	若開權顯實，則三是一，更無別一。	若開權顯實，則三是一，更無別一。	002	If it is about revealing the provisional and revealing the real, then the three are one, and there is no separate one.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c08_7']	故彼經云「汝等所行是菩薩道，先所出內是子所知。	故彼經云「汝等所行是菩薩道，先所出內是子所知。	002	Therefore, that sutra says, The path you are practicing is the bodhisattva path. What was previously given out is what the child knows.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c10_2']	」若廢權立實，義說為四，如攬三點以成一伊，點別非伊、伊具三點。	」若廢權立實，義說為四，如攬三點以成一伊，點別非伊、伊具三點。	002	If the provisional is abandoned and the real is established, it is explained as four, like grasping the three dots to form the letter i. The dots are not separate from the i, and the i possesses the three dots.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c10_12']	昔三既別，實不兼權；	昔三既別，實不兼權；	002	Since the three of the past were already separate, the real did not include the provisional;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c11_2']	今一全兼，成四無爽。	今一全兼，成四無爽。	002	Now the one completely includes, forming four without error.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c13_6']	若依昔未顯說一切具有如來知見，根敗之種今並說成，則今昔有異，於文有據，義亦極成。	若依昔未顯說一切具有如來知見，根敗之種今並說成，則今昔有異，於文有據，義亦極成。	002	If it is based on the past when it was not yet revealed that all possess the knowledge and vision of the Tathagata, the ruined seeds are now all said to be accomplished, then there is a difference between the past and present, and in the text there is a basis, and the meaning is also extremely established.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c14_9']	二陳隋二代天台智者，承南岳思大師，立四教云：	二陳隋二代天台智者，承南岳思大師，立四教云：	002	Second, the Tiantai Zhizhe of the Chen and Sui dynasties, inheriting the Southern Peak Master Si, established four teachings, saying:
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c15_17']	一三藏教，此教明因緣生滅四真諦理，正教小乘、旁化菩薩。	一三藏教，此教明因緣生滅四真諦理，正教小乘、旁化菩薩。	002	First, the Tripiṭaka Teaching. This teaching clarifies the principle of the four truths of arising and ceasing through causes and conditions, and it directly teaches the Lesser Vehicle while indirectly transforming bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c16_14']	二者通教，通者同也，三乘同稟故。	二者通教，通者同也，三乘同稟故。	002	Second, the Shared Teaching. Shared means the same, because the Three Vehicles equally receive it.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c18_7']	此教明因緣即空無生四真諦理，是摩訶衍之初門，正為菩薩、旁通二乘。	此教明因緣即空無生四真諦理，是摩訶衍之初門，正為菩薩、旁通二乘。	002	This teaching clarifies the principle of the four truths of non-arising and emptiness through causes and conditions. It is the initial gateway to the Mahāyāna, and it directly benefits bodhisattvas while indirectly benefiting the Two Vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c19_8']	《大品》云「欲得聲聞乘，當學般若波羅蜜」等。	《大品》云「欲得聲聞乘，當學般若波羅蜜」等。	002	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, If one wishes to attain the vehicle of the śrāvakas, one should study prajñā-pāramitā.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c20_16']	然教理智斷、行位因果皆通，淺深不同，於共般若唯共於淺。	然教理智斷、行位因果皆通，淺深不同，於共般若唯共於淺。	002	However, the teaching, wisdom, severing of afflictions, practice, stages, causes, and effects are all shared, but they differ in depth. Among the shared prajñā, it is only shared in the shallow aspects.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c21_14']	三別教，別即不共，不共二乘人說故。	三別教，別即不共，不共二乘人說故。	002	Third, the Distinct Teaching. Distinct means not shared, because it is not taught to those of the Two Vehicles.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c23_12']	此教正明因緣假名無量四真諦理，的化菩薩、不涉二乘，故聲聞在座如聾如盲。	此教正明因緣假名無量四真諦理，的化菩薩、不涉二乘，故聲聞在座如聾如盲。	002	This teaching directly clarifies the principle of the four truths of immeasurable provisional names through causes and conditions, and it specifically transforms bodhisattvas without involving the Two Vehicles. Therefore, śrāvakas sitting in the assembly are like the deaf and the blind.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c25_15']	不名不共而云別者，兼欲揀非圓故，以一因逈出、一果不融，歷別而修，不得因果圓融故。	不名不共而云別者，兼欲揀非圓故，以一因逈出、一果不融，歷別而修，不得因果圓融故。	002	It is not called exclusive, but is said to be separate, because it also distinguishes it from the perfect. Because the one cause is unique and the one fruit is not fused, it is cultivated separately and does not attain the perfect fusion of cause and effect.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c26_6']	四圓教，圓以不偏為義。	四圓教，圓以不偏為義。	002	Fourth, the perfect teaching. Perfect means not biased.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c28_7']	此教正明不思議因緣二諦中道，事理具足、不偏不別，但化最上利根之人，故名為圓。	此教正明不思議因緣二諦中道，事理具足、不偏不別，但化最上利根之人，故名為圓。	002	This teaching correctly clarifies the inconceivable dependent origination, the two truths, and the middle way. Its phenomena and principles are complete, not biased or separate. It only transforms those with the highest sharp faculties, and is therefore called perfect.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c29_5']	《華嚴經》云「顯現自在力，為說圓滿經。	《華嚴經》云「顯現自在力，為說圓滿經。	002	The Huayan Sutra says, Manifesting the power of freedom, expounding the perfect sutra.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0509c29_19']	無量諸眾生，悉受菩提記」等。	無量諸眾生，悉受菩提記」等。	002	Immeasurable sentient beings all receive the prediction of enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a01_14']	別則教理等皆別，圓則教等皆圓。	別則教理等皆別，圓則教等皆圓。	002	Separate means that the teachings, principles, etc. are all separate, while perfect means that the teachings, etc. are all perfect.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a03_1']	又此四教由三觀起，從假入空，析體異故，有初二教；	又此四教由三觀起，從假入空，析體異故，有初二教；	002	Moreover, these four teachings arise from the three contemplations. From the false entering the empty, analyzing and understanding differently, there are the first two teachings;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a03_16']	從空入假，從假入中，有別教起；	從空入假，從假入中，有別教起；	002	From the empty entering the false, from the false entering the middle, the separate teaching arises;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a04_9']	三觀一心中得，有圓教起。	三觀一心中得，有圓教起。	002	The three contemplations are attained in one mind, and the perfect teaching arises.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a05_10']	又此四教，不局定一部，一部之中容有多故。	又此四教，不局定一部，一部之中容有多故。	002	Moreover, these four teachings are not limited to a single scripture, because within a single scripture there may be many [teachings].
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a06_13']	又更以四種化儀收之，謂頓、漸、不定、祕密。	又更以四種化儀收之，謂頓、漸、不定、祕密。	002	Furthermore, they are subsumed by four kinds of methods of conversion, namely sudden, gradual, indeterminate, and secret.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a06_21']	頓、漸同前岌公；	頓、漸同前岌公；	002	Sudden and gradual are the same as the previous master Rujing;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a08_6']	後二謂一音異解，若互相知名為不定，互不相知即名祕密。	後二謂一音異解，若互相知名為不定，互不相知即名祕密。	002	The latter two refer to one sound with different understandings. If they mutually know each other, it is called indeterminate. If they do not mutually know each other, it is called secret.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a09_16']	此師立義理致圓備，但三藏教名義似小濫，以餘三教亦有三故。	此師立義理致圓備，但三藏教名義似小濫，以餘三教亦有三故。	002	This master's establishment of the teachings is complete in principle, but the name of the Tripiṭaka teaching seems slightly confused, because the other three teachings also have three [parts].
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a11_1']	所以爾者，良以《智論》之中多詺小乘為三藏故。	所以爾者，良以《智論》之中多詺小乘為三藏故。	002	The reason for this is that the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom often refers to the Hīnayāna as the Tripiṭaka.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a12_11']	《成實論》中亦自說云「我今欲說三藏中實義故、初對舊醫戒定慧故。	《成實論》中亦自說云「我今欲說三藏中實義故、初對舊醫戒定慧故。	002	The Treatise on the Establishment of Truth also says, I now wish to explain the true meaning in the Tripiṭaka, because it is the beginning, and the precepts, concentration, and wisdom are for the sake of the old doctors.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a14_15']	」立此三事迢然不同，異後三教，通教意融三故、別教依一法性而顯三故、圓教三一無障礙故。	」立此三事迢然不同，異後三教，通教意融三故、別教依一法性而顯三故、圓教三一無障礙故。	002	Establishing these three matters is distinctly different, unlike the latter three teachings. The meaning of the Shared Teaching is to merge the three, the meaning of the Distinct Teaching is to reveal the three based on the one Dharma nature, and the meaning of the Perfect Teaching is that the three and one are unobstructed.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a16_10']	所以不名小乘教者，此教亦有大乘，六度菩薩三十四心斷結成真佛故。	所以不名小乘教者，此教亦有大乘，六度菩薩三十四心斷結成真佛故。	002	The reason it is not called the Hīnayāna teaching is because this teaching also has the Mahāyāna. Bodhisattvas of the six perfections attain true Buddhahood by severing bonds in thirty-four mental states.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a18_5']	故藏通別圓之義四教互有，而覈其定實，餘三不成，唯成當教中義耳。	故藏通別圓之義四教互有，而覈其定實，餘三不成，唯成當教中義耳。	002	Therefore, the meanings of the Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, and Perfect teachings are mutually present in the four teachings, but if one examines their true reality, the other three are not established, and only the meanings within the corresponding teachings are established.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a20_4']	但判華嚴兼於圓別，以就登地已上約寄位行布為別義故，名異義同亦無大過。	但判華嚴兼於圓別，以就登地已上約寄位行布為別義故，名異義同亦無大過。	002	However, the Huayan Sūtra is classified as both the Perfect and Distinct teachings, because for those above the grounds, it is taught in terms of the Distinct meaning of provisional stages of practice. The names are different but the meanings are the same, so there is no great error.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a21_1', 'ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a21_16']	三唐初海東元曉法師，亦立四教：🔽一三乘別教，如四諦、緣起經等；	三唐初海東元曉法師，亦立四教： 一三乘別教，如四諦、緣起經等；	002	Third, the Dharma Master Wonhyo of the Eastern Sea during the Tang Dynasty also established four teachings:🔽1. The Tripiṭaka Teaching, such as the Four Treatises and the Pratītyasamutpāda Sūtra, etc.;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a22_14']	二三乘通教，如《般若》、《深密經》等；	二三乘通教，如《般若》、《深密經》等；	002	2. The Shared Teaching, such as the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras and the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, etc.;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a23_3']	三一乘分教，如《梵網經》等；	三一乘分教，如《梵網經》等；	002	Third, the partially complete teaching of the One Vehicle, such as the Brahma Net Sutra;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a23_17']	四一乘滿教，如《華嚴經》等。	四一乘滿教，如《華嚴經》等。	002	Fourth, the perfect and complete teaching of the One Vehicle, such as the Flower Ornament Sutra.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a26_1']	然三乘共學名三乘教，於中未明法空名別相教，說諸法空是為通教，不共二乘名一乘教。	然三乘共學名三乘教，於中未明法空名別相教，說諸法空是為通教，不共二乘名一乘教。	002	However, the teaching shared by the Three Vehicles is called the teaching of the Three Vehicles. Within it, the emptiness of phenomena is not yet clarified, so it is called the teaching of distinct characteristics. The teaching of the emptiness of all phenomena is called the universal teaching. The teaching not shared with the Two Vehicles is called the teaching of the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a27_4']	於中未顯普法名隨分教，具明普法名圓滿教。	於中未顯普法名隨分教，具明普法名圓滿教。	002	Within it, the universal Dharma is not yet revealed, so it is called the partially complete teaching. The complete clarification of the universal Dharma is called the perfect and complete teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a28_4']	然此大同天台，但合別圓，加一乘分耳。	然此大同天台，但合別圓，加一乘分耳。	002	However, this is largely the same as Tiantai, but it combines the distinct and perfect teachings and adds the partially complete teaching of the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a28_7']	自言：	自言：	002	He himself said:
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510a29_12']	「且依乘門略立四種，非謂此四遍攝一切」，故無有失。	「且依乘門略立四種，非謂此四遍攝一切」，故無有失。	002	For now, I rely on the approach of the vehicles to briefly establish four kinds. It is not that these four completely encompass everything, so there is no mistake.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b01_12']	四賢首弟子宛公，依《寶性論》立四種教。	四賢首弟子宛公，依《寶性論》立四種教。	002	The fourth, the disciple Wan Gong of Xian-shou, relies on the Ratnagotravibhāga to establish four kinds of teachings.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b02_10']	論云「有四種眾生，不識如來藏，如生盲人：	論云「有四種眾生，不識如來藏，如生盲人：	002	The treatise says: There are four kinds of sentient beings who do not recognize the tathāgatagarbha, like those born blind:
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b03_14']	一者凡夫、二者聲聞、三者辟支佛、四者初心菩薩。	一者凡夫、二者聲聞、三者辟支佛、四者初心菩薩。	002	First, ordinary beings; second, śrāvakas; third, pratyekabuddhas; fourth, beginner bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b04_11']	言四教者，一迷真異執教，當彼凡夫；	言四教者，一迷真異執教，當彼凡夫；	002	As for the four teachings, the first is the teaching of deluded attachment to the true nature, which corresponds to ordinary beings;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b05_4']	二真一分半教，當彼二乘；	二真一分半教，當彼二乘；	002	the second is the teaching of the true nature in one part and half, which corresponds to the two vehicles;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b05_18']	三真一分滿教，當彼初心菩薩；	三真一分滿教，當彼初心菩薩；	002	the third is the teaching of the true nature in one part and full, which corresponds to beginner bodhisattvas;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b06_15']	四真具分滿教，即當彼識如來藏者。	四真具分滿教，即當彼識如來藏者。	002	the fourth is the teaching of the true nature in full with all parts, which corresponds to those who know the tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b07_13']	」初教謂諸外道迷於真理，廣起異計。	」初教謂諸外道迷於真理，廣起異計。	002	The first teaching refers to the non-Buddhists who are deluded about the true nature and give rise to various false views.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b09_15']	二謂小乘，於真如隨緣不變二分義中，唯說生空所顯之理，故名為半，如《涅槃》半字。	二謂小乘，於真如隨緣不變二分義中，唯說生空所顯之理，故名為半，如《涅槃》半字。	002	The second refers to the Hīnayāna, which only explains the principle manifested by the emptiness of beings within the two aspects of the true nature's adaptability and immutability, and is therefore called half, like the half-letter in the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b10_11']	三謂但得不變，不得隨緣，故名一分；	三謂但得不變，不得隨緣，故名一分；	002	The third refers to only attaining immutability and not adaptability, and is therefore called one part;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b11_3']	而雙辯二空，故名為滿。	而雙辯二空，故名為滿。	002	but it discusses both kinds of emptiness, and is therefore called full.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b11_18']	四由具隨緣不變二義，故名具分。	四由具隨緣不變二義，故名具分。	002	The fourth is called with all parts because it includes both the aspects of adaptability and immutability.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b12_4']	廣如彼說。	廣如彼說。	002	It is explained in detail there.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b12_15']	然今判聖教，那參邪說？	然今判聖教，那參邪說？	002	However, now that you are judging the scriptures, why do you mix in heretical teachings?

['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b15_8']	又依《涅槃》為半滿者，後二既滿，不應復有一分之言；	又依《涅槃》為半滿者，後二既滿，不應復有一分之言；	002	Moreover, if you rely on the Nirvana Sutra to divide into half and full, since the last two are already full, you should not speak of them again as one part;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0510b16_3']	既但得不變一分，豈名為滿？	既但得不變一分，豈名為滿？	002	since you only obtain the unchanging one part, how can it be called full?

['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b19_1']	言五教者，一小乘教、二大乘始教、三終教、四頓教、五圓教。	言五教者，一小乘教、二大乘始教、三終教、四頓教、五圓教。	002	As for the five teachings, the first is the Hīnayāna teaching, the second is the initial Mahāyāna teaching, the third is the final teaching, the fourth is the sudden teaching, and the fifth is the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b19_8']	初即天台藏教。	初即天台藏教。	002	The first is the Tripiṭaka Master's teaching of the Hīnayāna.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b21_10']	二始教者，亦名分教，以《深密》第二第三時教，同許定性二乘俱不成佛，故今合之總為一教。	二始教者，亦名分教，以《深密》第二第三時教，同許定性二乘俱不成佛，故今合之總為一教。	002	As for the second initial teaching, it is also called the partial teaching. The second and third periods of teachings in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra both agree that those of fixed Hīnayāna potential will not attain Buddhahood, so they are now combined into one teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b22_6']	此既未盡大乘法理，故立為初。	此既未盡大乘法理，故立為初。	002	Since this teaching has not yet exhausted the principles of the Mahāyāna Dharma, it is established as the first.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b22_16']	有不成佛，故名為分。	有不成佛，故名為分。	002	Since there are those who do not attain Buddhahood, it is called partial.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b23_6']	三終教者，亦名實教。	三終教者，亦名實教。	002	As for the third final teaching, it is also called the true teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b24_15']	定性二乘、無性闡提悉當成佛，方盡大乘至極之說，故立為終。	定性二乘、無性闡提悉當成佛，方盡大乘至極之說，故立為終。	002	Those of fixed Hīnayāna potential and those of no potential will all attain Buddhahood, which is the ultimate teaching of the Mahāyāna, so it is established as the final.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b25_6']	以稱實理，故名為實。	以稱實理，故名為實。	002	Since it accords with true principles, it is called true.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b26_5']	上二教並依地位漸次修成，故總名為漸。	上二教並依地位漸次修成，故總名為漸。	002	The above two teachings both rely on gradual cultivation through the stages of spiritual development, so they are collectively called gradual.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b27_16']	四頓教者，但一念不生即名為佛，不依地位漸次而說，故立為頓。	四頓教者，但一念不生即名為佛，不依地位漸次而說，故立為頓。	002	The fourth is the sudden teaching, which states that a single thought of enlightenment is itself called Buddhahood, and does not rely on gradual stages of spiritual levels. Therefore, it is established as sudden.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512b29_1']	如《思益》云「得諸法正性者，不從一地至於一地。	如《思益》云「得諸法正性者，不從一地至於一地。	002	As the Sutra of Contemplating the Buddha says, One who attains the true nature of all dharmas does not go from one stage to another stage.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c01_1']	」《楞伽》云「初地即為八，乃至無所有，何次」等。	」《楞伽》云「初地即為八，乃至無所有，何次」等。	002	The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra says, The first stage is the eighth, and so on, up to the non-existent. What sequence is there?
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c02_6']	不同前漸次位修行、不同於後圓融具德，故立名頓。	不同前漸次位修行、不同於後圓融具德，故立名頓。	002	It is different from the gradual cultivation of spiritual levels in the previous [teachings], and different from the perfect and harmonious virtues in the following [teachings]. Therefore, it is named sudden.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c02_16']	頓詮此理，故名頓教。	頓詮此理，故名頓教。	002	The sudden teaching expounds this principle, and is therefore called the sudden teaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c03_15']	天台所以不立者，以四教中皆有一絕言故。	天台所以不立者，以四教中皆有一絕言故。	002	The reason why Tiantai does not establish [the sudden teaching] is because there is a transcendence of words in all four teachings.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c05_2']	今乃開者，頓顯絕言，別為一類離念機故，即順禪宗。	今乃開者，頓顯絕言，別為一類離念機故，即順禪宗。	002	Now, in opening [the sudden teaching], it suddenly reveals the transcendence of words, specifically for the type of practitioners who are free from thoughts, which accords with the Chan School.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c06_17']	五圓教者，明一位即一切位、一切位即一位，是故十信滿心即攝五位成正覺等。	五圓教者，明一位即一切位、一切位即一位，是故十信滿心即攝五位成正覺等。	002	The fifth is the perfect teaching, which clarifies that a single stage is all stages, and all stages are a single stage. Therefore, at the completion of the mind of the ten faiths, the five stages are included and perfect enlightenment is attained, and so on.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c08_5']	依普賢法界帝網重重主伴具足，故名圓教，如此經等說。	依普賢法界帝網重重主伴具足，故名圓教，如此經等說。	002	Relying on the net of Indra's jewels, with the host and retinue complete, it is called the perfect teaching, as explained in this sutra and others.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c10_3']	若約所說法相者，初小乘中，但說七十五法、但說人空，縱少說法空，亦不明顯。	若約所說法相者，初小乘中，但說七十五法、但說人空，縱少說法空，亦不明顯。	002	If we discuss it in terms of the characteristics of the teachings, in the initial Hinayana, it only explains the seventy-five dharmas and only explains the emptiness of persons. Even if it occasionally explains the emptiness of dharmas, it is still not clear.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c12_11']	但依六識三毒，建立染淨根本，故《阿含》云「貪恚愚癡是世間根本」等，未盡法源，故多諍論，部執不同。	但依六識三毒，建立染淨根本，故《阿含》云「貪恚愚癡是世間根本」等，未盡法源，故多諍論，部執不同。	002	It only establishes the root of defilement and purity based on the six consciousnesses and the three poisons. Therefore, the Agamas say, Greed, anger, and delusion are the root of the world. Since it has not exhausted the source of the Dharma, there are many disputes and different sectarian views.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c13_6']	二始教中，廣說法相，少說法性。	二始教中，廣說法相，少說法性。	002	In the initial teaching, it extensively explains the characteristics of dharmas and briefly explains the nature of dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c14_11']	所說法性即法相數，說有百法決擇分明，故少諍論。	所說法性即法相數，說有百法決擇分明，故少諍論。	002	The nature of dharmas explained is the number of characteristics of dharmas. It explains the one hundred dharmas with clear discrimination, so there are few disputes.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c16_15']	說有八識唯是生滅，依生滅識建立生死及涅槃因，法爾種子有無永別，是故五性決定不同。	說有八識唯是生滅，依生滅識建立生死及涅槃因，法爾種子有無永別，是故五性決定不同。	002	It explains that the eight consciousnesses are only arising and ceasing. It establishes the causes of samsara and nirvana based on the consciousnesses of arising and ceasing. The seeds of dharmatā are eternally separate from existence and nonexistence. Therefore, the five natures are definitely not the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c18_2']	既所立識唯業惑生，故所立真如常恒不變，不許隨緣。	既所立識唯業惑生，故所立真如常恒不變，不許隨緣。	002	Since the established consciousnesses are only born from karma and afflictions, the established true suchness is eternally unchanging and does not allow for following conditions.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c19_2']	依他起性似有不無，非即無性真空圓成。	依他起性似有不無，非即無性真空圓成。	002	The dependent nature appears to exist but not not exist, and is not the naturelessness of true emptiness and perfect accomplishment.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c19_12']	說經空義，但約所執。	說經空義，但約所執。	002	The meaning of emptiness in the sūtras is only about the imagined.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c21_1']	既言三性五性不同，故說一分眾生決不成佛，名生界不減。	既言三性五性不同，故說一分眾生決不成佛，名生界不減。	002	Since it is said that the three natures and five natures are different, it is said that a portion of sentient beings will definitely not become Buddhas, and it is called the realm of sentient beings does not decrease.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c22_11']	真俗二諦，迢然不同，非斷非常，果生因滅，同時四相，滅表後無。	真俗二諦，迢然不同，非斷非常，果生因滅，同時四相，滅表後無。	002	The two truths of truth and convention are far apart and not the same. It is not annihilation or permanence. The effect is born and the cause ceases. The four characteristics at the same time. Cessation indicates non-existence after.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c24_10']	根本、後得，緣境斷惑，義說雙觀決定別照，以有為智證無為理，義說不異而實非一。	根本、後得，緣境斷惑，義說雙觀決定別照，以有為智證無為理，義說不異而實非一。	002	The fundamental and subsequently attained [wisdoms] sever delusions by relying on objects. The meaning is that they both contemplate and definitely illuminate separately. Using conditioned wisdom to realize the unconditioned truth, the meaning is said to be no different but is actually not one.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c26_3']	既出世智依生滅識種，故四智心品為相所遷，佛果報身有為無漏。	既出世智依生滅識種，故四智心品為相所遷，佛果報身有為無漏。	002	Since supramundane wisdom relies on the seeds of the consciousness of arising and ceasing, the class of mind of the four wisdoms is moved by characteristics. The retribution body of the Buddha is conditioned and uncontaminated.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0512c27_4']	如是義類廣有眾多，具如《瑜伽》、《雜集》等說。	如是義類廣有眾多，具如《瑜伽》、《雜集》等說。	002	There are many such meanings and categories, as explained in detail in the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra and the Abhidharmasamuccaya.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a02_2']	三終教中，少說法相，多說法性，所說法相亦會歸性，所立八識通如來藏隨緣成立，不生滅與生滅和合，而成非一非異，一切眾生平等一性，但是真如隨緣成立。	三終教中，少說法相，多說法性，所說法相亦會歸性，所立八識通如來藏隨緣成立，不生滅與生滅和合，而成非一非異，一切眾生平等一性，但是真如隨緣成立。	002	Third, in the definitive teaching, it explains few characteristics of phenomena and many of the nature of phenomena. The characteristics of phenomena explained are also subsumed and return to the nature. The eight consciousnesses established are all the tathāgatagarbha, which arises through conditions and is established. The non-arising and non-ceasing merges with arising and ceasing, and thus forms neither one nor different. All sentient beings are equally one nature, which is merely true suchness arising through conditions and established.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a03_8']	依他無性即是圓成，一理齊平，故說生界佛界不增不減。	依他無性即是圓成，一理齊平，故說生界佛界不增不減。	002	The naturelessness of the dependent is precisely the perfected, and the one principle is equal. Therefore, it is said that the realm of sentient beings and the realm of buddhas do not increase or decrease.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a05_11']	第一義空該通真妄，真非俗外，即俗而真故，雖空不斷、雖有不常，四相同時，體性即滅。	第一義空該通真妄，真非俗外，即俗而真故，雖空不斷、雖有不常，四相同時，體性即滅。	002	The emptiness of ultimate truth encompasses both truth and falsehood. Truth is not outside of convention; it is precisely convention as truth. Therefore, although empty, it is not cut off; although existent, it is not permanent. The four characteristics are simultaneous, and their essence is precisely cessation.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a06_1']	緣境斷惑，不二而二；	緣境斷惑，不二而二；	002	Cessation of delusion through contemplating the object is non-dual, yet dual;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a06_16']	有能所斷，二而不二，說為內證。	有能所斷，二而不二，說為內證。	002	There is the ability to cut off, and the cutting off is dual, yet non-dual. This is called internal realization.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a07_6']	照惑無本，即是智體；	照惑無本，即是智體；	002	Illuminating that delusion has no basis is precisely the essence of wisdom;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a07_16']	照體無自，即是證如。	照體無自，即是證如。	002	Illuminating that the essence of wisdom is not self-existent is precisely realizing suchness.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a08_6']	非智外如，為智所證；	非智外如，為智所證；	002	It is not that apart from wisdom there is suchness that is realized by wisdom;
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a08_16']	非如外智，能證於如。	非如外智，能證於如。	002	It is not that apart from suchness there is wisdom that can realize suchness.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a11_1']	世出世智，依如來藏，始本不二，則有為無為非一非異，故佛化身即常即法，不墮諸數，況於報體。	世出世智，依如來藏，始本不二，則有為無為非一非異，故佛化身即常即法，不墮諸數，況於報體。	002	The worldly and supramundane wisdoms rely on the tathāgatagarbha. The primordial and the fundamental are non-dual. Then the conditioned and the unconditioned are neither one nor different. Therefore, the Buddha's transformation body is both permanent and the Dharma, not falling into any categories. How much more so for the reward body.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a11_11']	即體之智，非相所遷。	即體之智，非相所遷。	002	The wisdom that is identical to the essence is not changed by characteristics.

There are also no distinctions in the eight consciousnesses. All that exists is only false imagination, and the entire Dharma realm is only beyond words.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a19_2']	五法三自性俱空，八識二無我雙遣，訶教勸離、毀相泯心，生心即妄、不生即佛，亦無佛無不佛、無生無不生，如淨名默住顯不二等，是其意也。	五法三自性俱空，八識二無我雙遣，訶教勸離、毀相泯心，生心即妄、不生即佛，亦無佛無不佛、無生無不生，如淨名默住顯不二等，是其意也。	002	The five dharmas and three natures are both empty, the eight consciousnesses and two kinds of no-self are both eliminated, one is admonished to leave behind the teachings, destroy characteristics, and obliterate the mind, the arising of thought is delusion, non-arising is Buddha, there is no Buddha and no non-Buddha, no arising and no non-arising, like Vimalakīrti's silent sitting to manifest non-duality, this is its meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513a22_1']	五圓教中，所說唯是無盡法界，性海圓融、緣起無礙、相即相入，如因陀羅網重重無際，微細相容、主伴無盡，十十法門各攝法界。	五圓教中，所說唯是無盡法界，性海圓融、緣起無礙、相即相入，如因陀羅網重重無際，微細相容、主伴無盡，十十法門各攝法界。	002	In the fifth perfect teaching, what is expounded is only the inexhaustible Dharma realm, the perfect fusion of the nature ocean, the unobstructed conditioned arising, the mutual inclusion of characteristics, like the Indra's net with layers upon layers without end, the subtle mutual containment, the host and companions being inexhaustible, the ten sets of ten Dharma gates each subsuming the Dharma realm.

['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513b02_14']	二對權顯實，前則二是三乘、後三為一乘，則不違《法華》四乘。	二對權顯實，前則二是三乘、後三為一乘，則不違《法華》四乘。	002	Second, contrasting the provisional to reveal the real. The former are the three vehicles, and the latter three are the one vehicle, then it does not contradict the four vehicles of the Lotus Sūtra.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513b05_7']	三者三四二教雖則泯二異前，而對三顯一曲巧順機，後一直顯本法一向不共，如《智論》說，此同印公平道屈曲。	三者三四二教雖則泯二異前，而對三顯一曲巧順機，後一直顯本法一向不共，如《智論》說，此同印公平道屈曲。	002	Third, although the two teachings of three and four eliminate the two and differ from the previous, in contrasting the three to reveal the one, they skillfully follow the capacities. The latter directly reveals the fundamental Dharma, which is always not shared, like the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says. This is the same as the flat and winding of the seal.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513b06_9']	三或分為三，初一小乘、次一三乘、後三一乘。	三或分為三，初一小乘、次一三乘、後三一乘。	002	Third, they may be divided into three, the first is the small vehicle, the next is the three vehicles, and the last three are the one vehicle.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0513b08_1']	或唯後一是不共一乘，《智論》指此以為不共，《大品》等經共二乘說故。	或唯後一是不共一乘，《智論》指此以為不共，《大品》等經共二乘說故。	002	Or, only the last one is the uncommon One Vehicle. The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom points to this as the uncommon, because the sutras such as the Great Perfection of Wisdom are taught in common with the two vehicles.

['ZH_T35_1735_002:0514b06_4']	由上二義互該徹故，皆同一性，故〈出現品〉云「如來成正覺時，於其身中普見一切眾生成正覺，乃至普見一切眾生入涅槃，皆同一性，所謂無性。	由上二義互該徹故，皆同一性，故〈出現品〉云「如來成正覺時，於其身中普見一切眾生成正覺，乃至普見一切眾生入涅槃，皆同一性，所謂無性。	002	Because of these two meanings mutually penetrating each other, they are all of the same nature. Therefore, the Appearance of the Tathagata Chapter says, When the Tathagata attains perfect enlightenment, he universally sees all sentient beings attaining perfect enlightenment in his body, up to universally seeing all sentient beings entering nirvana, all of the same nature, which is called no nature.

['ZH_T35_1735_002:0517b01_1']	二事既如理能包，亦如理廣遍而不壞陜相故，有廣陜純雜無礙門。	二事既如理能包，亦如理廣遍而不壞陜相故，有廣陜純雜無礙門。	002	Second, since events are able to contain according to principle, they are also as vast and pervasive as principle without destroying the narrow characteristics, thus there is the unobstructed gate of vastness, narrowness, purity, and mixture.
['ZH_T35_1735_002:0517b01_16']	又性常平等故純，普攝諸法故雜。	又性常平等故純，普攝諸法故雜。	002	Moreover, because the nature is always equal, it is pure; because it universally includes all dharmas, it is mixed.
