['ZH_T35_1734_001:0496c24_7']	不離昇天，是重化故；	不離昇天，是重化故；	Not leaving the heaven, this is a repeated transformation.
['ZH_T35_1734_001:0496c25_3']	以釋迦異名名盧舍那，非別報身故。	以釋迦異名名盧舍那，非別報身故。	Because Śākyamuni's different name is Vairocana, not a separate reward body.

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0496c28_2']	下第七會初歎佛有彼二十一種殊勝功德，是實報也；	下第七會初歎佛有彼二十一種殊勝功德，是實報也；	At the beginning of the seventh assembly below, praising the Buddha's twenty-one kinds of supreme merits, this is the true reward.

This can be seen by analogy.

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b06_13']	又有釋言，不起是法身，昇天是化用。	又有釋言，不起是法身，昇天是化用。	There is another explanation that not rising refers to the Dharma body, and ascending to heaven refers to the transformative function.
['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b07_6']	此恐非理，豈可法身坐道樹耶？	此恐非理，豈可法身坐道樹耶？	This is probably unreasonable. How can the Dharma body sit under the bodhi tree?

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b09_5']	不往即往故，所以昇天也。	不往即往故，所以昇天也。	Because not going is precisely going, therefore one ascends to heaven.
['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b09_17']	如不來相而來，名善來等。	如不來相而來，名善來等。	It is like the non-coming aspect coming, which is called welcome and so forth.

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b15_1']	然先未用此天宮處，今欲於中說法用故，說為昇也。	然先未用此天宮處，今欲於中說法用故，說為昇也。	However, this place of the heavenly palace was not used before, now wanting to use it to speak the Dharma, therefore it is said to be ascending.
['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b15_16']	又相即故，不起門別，故有昇也。	又相即故，不起門別，故有昇也。	Also, because of the mutual inclusion, without rising, there is a separate gate, therefore there is ascending.

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b17_17']	謂此坐樹王下之佛身，即遍法界一切處故，是故佛身本來在彼忉利等處，故不待起也。	謂此坐樹王下之佛身，即遍法界一切處故，是故佛身本來在彼忉利等處，故不待起也。	It means that the Buddha's body sitting under the tree king is universally in all places in the Dharma realm, therefore the Buddha's body is originally in the places such as the Heaven of the Thirty-three, therefore it does not need to rise.
['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b18_14']	今欲用此忉利門中之佛，故曰昇也。	今欲用此忉利門中之佛，故曰昇也。	Now wanting to use the Buddha in the gate of the Heaven of the Thirty-three, therefore it is said to be ascending.

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b23_7']	是故此佛坐樹下時、昇天去時、到天處時，一一時皆遍法界，攝前後際盡，即知坐樹下時永無起時，故云不起也。	是故此佛坐樹下時、昇天去時、到天處時，一一時皆遍法界，攝前後際盡，即知坐樹下時永無起時，故云不起也。	Therefore, when this Buddha sits under the tree, ascends to heaven, and reaches the heavenly abode, each time pervades the Dharma realm, encompassing the past and future, and one knows that the time of sitting under the tree is forever without arising, so it is said to be non-arising.
['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b25_8']	若正去時，亦如此故唯有去，無餘也，皆念念不相至，各各收法界，如是緣起門，無礙恒不離。	若正去時，亦如此故唯有去，無餘也，皆念念不相至，各各收法界，如是緣起門，無礙恒不離。	If it is the time of going, it is also like this, so there is only going, nothing else. Each moment does not reach the other, and each encompasses the Dharma realm. Such a dependent origination gate is unobstructed and always inseparable.

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497b27_7']	以彼樹下坐等，亦不異真，故同真如。	以彼樹下坐等，亦不異真，故同真如。	Because sitting under the tree and so forth are also not different from the true, they are the same as true suchness.

['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497c08_1']	謂後會必具前，故不捨前而成後。	謂後會必具前，故不捨前而成後。	That is to say, the later assembly must possess the previous, and therefore one does not abandon the previous to accomplish the later.
['ZH_T35_1734_001:0497c09_1']	若捨前則壞緣起，是故不起前而昇後也。	若捨前則壞緣起，是故不起前而昇後也。	If one abandons the previous, then one destroys dependent arising. Therefore, without rising from the previous, one ascends to the later.
