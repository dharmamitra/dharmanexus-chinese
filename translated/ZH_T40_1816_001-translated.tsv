Initially, it is named after the superior, therefore it is pointed out separately next, as it is in the question.

Tathāgata is the first title. Beginning from the end and including the beginning, the middle is omitted. Therefore, the Sutra of Cutting Off says, Up to the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One. By mentioning the last one, the middle six are omitted, and the first three are reached. The remaining text is all omitted, up to the ten titles. As explained in the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra fascicle 82.

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0719c08_14']	又此欲歎佛希有攝、付，乃言云何，翻成問佛，非是歎詞，深為乖角。	又此欲歎佛希有攝、付，乃言云何，翻成問佛，非是歎詞，深為乖角。	001	Moreover, this is to praise the Buddha's rare skillful means and entrustment, yet it says how does. On the contrary, it becomes asking the Buddha, not a phrase of praise. It is deeply discordant.

The remaining text only says well protected, well remembered, etc. The text below then opens up the first and well, with two different meanings.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0719c11_18']	最勝之言，其具第一、善二義故，此能攝受法，下論自解。	最勝之言，其具第一、善二義故，此能攝受法，下論自解。	001	The word supreme has two meanings: first, it is the best; second, it is good. This can embrace the Dharma, as will be explained below in the treatise.

Combining the sutra and two treatises, there are six meanings of embracing and entrusting: First, the one who can embrace and entrust is only the Tathāgata in the stage of fruition. The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra states that there are six who can accomplish [the Dharma]: first, bodhisattvas on the stage of practicing with resolve; second, bodhisattvas on the stage of pure superior intention; third, bodhisattvas on the stage of practicing correctly; fourth, bodhisattvas on the stage of following certainty; fifth, bodhisattvas on the stage of definite practice; sixth, bodhisattvas on the stage of reaching the ultimate.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0719c18_8']	彼在因位，此說果位，說一切位，極深妙法，非餘能故。	彼在因位，此說果位，說一切位，極深妙法，非餘能故。	001	They are in the stage of causes, while this speaks of the stage of fruition. It is said that the most profound and wonderful Dharma is not something that others can do.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0719c19_16']	又此說法王，彼說佛在世時及佛無後能成熟者，故不相違。	又此說法王，彼說佛在世時及佛無後能成熟者，故不相違。	001	Moreover, this speaks of the Dharma King, while that speaks of when the Buddha was in the world and after the Buddha's passing, there was no one else who could bring it to maturity. Therefore, there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a03_1']	二、所攝、付者，謂諸菩薩雖所成就通有四乘，行二利行，通他三乘，餘解不能故，此唯菩薩。	二、所攝、付者，謂諸菩薩雖所成就通有四乘，行二利行，通他三乘，餘解不能故，此唯菩薩。	001	Second, as for those who are to be guided and entrusted, although bodhisattvas have accomplished the four vehicles, they practice the two kinds of benefiting others, which are common to the three vehicles, and others are unable to understand. Therefore, this is only for bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a03_11']	此上二種，經文自有。	此上二種，經文自有。	001	These two kinds are found in the sutra text itself.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a05_11']	三、攝、付之時，此中論云，於佛證正覺轉法輪時，以五義中菩薩乘法化根已熟，名為善攝；	三、攝、付之時，此中論云，於佛證正覺轉法輪時，以五義中菩薩乘法化根已熟，名為善攝；	001	Third, as for the time of guiding and entrusting, the treatise states that when the Buddha realized perfect enlightenment and turned the wheel of the Dharma, he used the five meanings to guide those whose faculties were already ripe in the bodhisattva vehicle, which is called guiding well;
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a06_15']	於佛涅槃時，亦以五義化已得攝受菩薩，名善付囑。	於佛涅槃時，亦以五義化已得攝受菩薩，名善付囑。	001	When the Buddha entered nirvana, he also used the five meanings to guide and entrust the bodhisattvas who had already been accepted, which is called entrusting well.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a08_11']	四、所攝、付類，天親論云，善攝化根已熟，善付化根未熟，此中二時俱化根熟。	四、所攝、付類，天親論云，善攝化根已熟，善付化根未熟，此中二時俱化根熟。	001	Fourth, as for the types of those to be guided and entrusted, the treatise by Vasubandhu states: Guiding well those whose faculties are already ripe, entrusting well those whose faculties are not yet ripe. Here, at both times, those whose faculties are already ripe are guided.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a10_9']	一解，二論義同，此中意說，根熟菩薩，佛初成道，佛自攝受，令依教行，稟於佛訓。	一解，二論義同，此中意說，根熟菩薩，佛初成道，佛自攝受，令依教行，稟於佛訓。	001	One interpretation is that the two treatises have the same meaning. The meaning here is explained as follows: For the bodhisattvas whose faculties are already ripe, when the Buddha first attained enlightenment, the Buddha himself accepted them, causing them to practice in accordance with the teachings and receive the Buddha's instructions.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a12_8']	佛入滅時，佛化既無，無能攝付，但以佛法，付根已熟，令根未熟於彼受化，名善付囑。	佛入滅時，佛化既無，無能攝付，但以佛法，付根已熟，令根未熟於彼受化，名善付囑。	001	When the Buddha enters extinction, since the Buddha's transformations are no more, there is no one to take charge and entrust. He simply entrusts the Buddha's teachings to those whose faculties are already ripe, so that those whose faculties are not yet ripe may receive transformation from them. This is called good entrustment.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a15_1']	故此說言，已得攝受菩薩於佛滅時，亦以五義而建立之，非是二時俱以五菩薩法建立已熟名善付囑，故二論同。	故此說言，已得攝受菩薩於佛滅時，亦以五義而建立之，非是二時俱以五菩薩法建立已熟名善付囑，故二論同。	001	Therefore, this says that the bodhisattvas who have already been accepted, even at the time of the Buddha's extinction, establish themselves through the five meanings. It is not that both times are established through the five bodhisattva dharmas. Those whose faculties are already ripe are called well entrusted, so the two treatises are the same.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a16_1']	由佛若在，未熟菩薩亦自攝、付，劣故隱之。	由佛若在，未熟菩薩亦自攝、付，劣故隱之。	001	Because if the Buddha is present, even the immature bodhisattvas will take charge and entrust themselves, but because they are inferior, this is concealed.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a16_16']	或此中付論遇佛皆熟，名善攝受；	或此中付論遇佛皆熟，名善攝受；	001	Or, in this case, those who encounter the Buddha are all mature, and are called well accepted;

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a19_4']	故真諦經云，善攝受者由無上利益故，善付囑者由無上教故。	故真諦經云，善攝受者由無上利益故，善付囑者由無上教故。	001	Therefore, the Satyasiddhi-śāstra says, Well accepted is because of the unsurpassed benefit, well entrusted is because of the unsurpassed teaching.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a21_16']	二解，兩論意別，此依二時俱依根熟，已顯攝、付，佛在所化，當來之世成能化故，根未熟者，非當能化，故略不說。	二解，兩論意別，此依二時俱依根熟，已顯攝、付，佛在所化，當來之世成能化故，根未熟者，非當能化，故略不說。	001	The two explanations have different intentions in the two treatises. This [treatise] relies on the two times being both based on those with mature faculties. It has already shown the inclusion and entrustment, with the Buddha being in the world to transform, because in the future world he will accomplish the ability to transform. Those with immature faculties are not able to transform in the future, so it is omitted.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a22_20']	彼依一時、當來能化、所化二類，以分攝、付，各聖義別。	彼依一時、當來能化、所化二類，以分攝、付，各聖義別。	001	That [treatise] relies on one time, with the ability to transform and the transformed in the future divided into inclusion and entrustment, each with a different holy meaning.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a23_9']	彼所無者，此便解之。	彼所無者，此便解之。	001	What is not in that [treatise] is explained here.

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720a25_6']	或有解云，謂五乘法中菩薩之法。	或有解云，謂五乘法中菩薩之法。	001	Some explain it as saying, The bodhisattva Dharma among the dharmas of the five vehicles.

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b02_19', 'ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b05_1']	今為二解，一云，即下重釋前之玄宗之巨委中，釋布施云，自此已後，餘住處中，有五種隨所相應而解釋，一、依義，二、說相，三、攝持，四、安立，五、顯現，即是經中所明，理事二行，善惡二門，菩薩修斷之法，是佛二時所攝、付法。🔽二云，即前七義句中，後五句義所明菩薩行法，前二門問，後五佛答，是正所明能攝、付法。	今為二解，一云，即下重釋前之玄宗之巨委中，釋布施云，自此已後，餘住處中，有五種隨所相應而解釋，一、依義，二、說相，三、攝持，四、安立，五、顯現，即是經中所明，理事二行，善惡二門，菩薩修斷之法，是佛二時所攝、付法。 二云，即前七義句中，後五句義所明菩薩行法，前二門問，後五佛答，是正所明能攝、付法。	001	Now there are two explanations: The first says that below, in the detailed explanation of the profound principles, in the explanation of giving, it says, From here on, in the other stages, there are five kinds that correspond to the explanation, namely, 1. based on meaning, 2. speaking of characteristics, 3. embracing, 4. establishing, 5. manifesting, which is what is clarified in the sutra, the two practices of principle and phenomena, the two gates of good and evil, the Dharma of bodhisattvas' cultivation and elimination, which is the Dharma that the Buddha has taken in and entrusted during the two periods.🔽The second says that among the seven meanings and phrases above, the Dharma of bodhisattva practice clarified in the latter five phrases, the former two gates are questions, and the latter five are the Buddha's answers, which is the Dharma that is to be taken in and entrusted.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b07_2']	天親釋此能攝、付法，彼云，護念是此攝受，攝受根熟有二，一、與智慧力，令自成就佛法；	天親釋此能攝、付法，彼云，護念是此攝受，攝受根熟有二，一、與智慧力，令自成就佛法；	001	Asanga explains this Dharma that is to be taken in and entrusted, saying, Protection and remembrance is the taking in and accepting of this. There are two kinds of taking in and accepting those with mature faculties: 1. Giving them the power of wisdom, enabling them to accomplish the Buddha Dharma by themselves;
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b07_19']	二、與教化力，即是大悲令攝取眾生。	二、與教化力，即是大悲令攝取眾生。	001	Second, bestowing the power of teaching and transforming, which is precisely the great compassion that causes one to embrace sentient beings.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b09_15']	付囑中，彼論有二，一、總解云，謂根未熟，於得、未得功德中，懼其退失，付授智者。	付囑中，彼論有二，一、總解云，謂根未熟，於得、未得功德中，懼其退失，付授智者。	001	In the entrustment, the treatise has two parts. First, the general explanation states: Those whose faculties are not yet mature, fearing regression and loss regarding the virtues they have attained and those they have not yet attained, entrust them to the wise.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b10_13']	二、別解云，又得不退者，不捨大乘故。	二、別解云，又得不退者，不捨大乘故。	001	Second, the specific explanation states: Moreover, those who have attained non-regression do not abandon the Mahayana.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b12_6']	此所付法，謂十住第六住已前所已得法，未得不退，於大乘中欲令勝進故；	此所付法，謂十住第六住已前所已得法，未得不退，於大乘中欲令勝進故；	001	The Dharma entrusted here refers to the Dharma already attained before the sixth stage of the ten abodes. Those who have not attained non-regression, in order to cause them to progress in the Mahayana,
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b13_2']	此所付法，第七住後所未得法。	此所付法，第七住後所未得法。	001	The Dharma entrusted here refers to the Dharma not yet attained after the seventh stage.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b15_9']	此中總顯根熟菩薩在七住後不退位中，未熟菩薩在六住前可退位內故，《瑜伽論》說，能成熟有六種住。	此中總顯根熟菩薩在七住後不退位中，未熟菩薩在六住前可退位內故，《瑜伽論》說，能成熟有六種住。	001	Here, it generally shows that bodhisattvas whose faculties are mature, after the seventh stage, are in the stage of non-regression, while bodhisattvas whose faculties are not yet mature, before the sixth stage, are in the stage of possible regression. Therefore, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that there are six kinds of abodes that can bring about maturity.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b16_14']	又勝解行位亦名能熟，即是此中在七住後所善攝者；	又勝解行位亦名能熟，即是此中在七住後所善攝者；	001	Moreover, the stage of resolute practice is also called that which can bring about maturity. This is precisely what is well-embraced by those after the seventh stage here;
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b18_8']	六住已前即是此中所付囑者，由以位可退，令不捨大乘，攝、付囑故。	六住已前即是此中所付囑者，由以位可退，令不捨大乘，攝、付囑故。	001	Those below the sixth stage are those entrusted here, because they can regress in their stages and are prevented from abandoning the Great Vehicle and are included in and entrusted with it.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b19_6']	又此意言說，不捨大乘定信，非不捨位。	又此意言說，不捨大乘定信，非不捨位。	001	Moreover, this means that they do not abandon faith in the Great Vehicle, not that they do not abandon their stages.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b21_11']	若作此解，十信之中，第六已前名根未熟，專信大乘猶未定故，第六心已後名根已熟，信決定故。	若作此解，十信之中，第六已前名根未熟，專信大乘猶未定故，第六心已後名根已熟，信決定故。	001	If we interpret it this way, the first five of the ten faiths are called immature faculties because their faith in the Great Vehicle is still not definite, while the sixth stage of faith and beyond are called mature faculties because their faith is definite.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b24_2']	又不論定故，若全未信名根未熟，猶住劫外，若起信心名根已熟，即入劫內，故《瑜伽》言，能成就者，通勝解行。	又不論定故，若全未信名根未熟，猶住劫外，若起信心名根已熟，即入劫內，故《瑜伽》言，能成就者，通勝解行。	001	Moreover, it is not discussed in terms of definiteness. If they have not yet fully believed, they are called immature faculties and still abide outside the kalpa. If they arouse faith, they are called mature faculties and immediately enter the kalpa. Therefore, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says that those who can accomplish it are both those of resolve and practice.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b26_6']	上來且說三位二類，初地、八地證行二種，有退、不退兩位二類，亦應分別，上化下故，下稟上故。	上來且說三位二類，初地、八地證行二種，有退、不退兩位二類，亦應分別，上化下故，下稟上故。	001	The above discussion has only mentioned the two types of three stages. The two types of two stages of non-regression in the first ground and eighth ground should also be distinguished, because the higher teaches the lower and the lower receives from the higher.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720b27_14']	下文已成就有三品，其所善攝、付囑在此明之二類隨應當知。	下文已成就有三品，其所善攝、付囑在此明之二類隨應當知。	001	The text below has already accomplished three grades, and the well-received entrustment is explained here. The two categories should be known as appropriate.

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c02_1']	上六義中，經文有二，一、能攝、付者，二、所攝、付者。	上六義中，經文有二，一、能攝、付者，二、所攝、付者。	001	Among the above six meanings, the sūtra text has two parts: first, the one who receives and entrusts; second, the one who is received and entrusted.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c03_9']	無著論有二全一少分，二全者，一、攝付之時，二、所攝付相；	無著論有二全一少分，二全者，一、攝付之時，二、所攝付相；	001	Asaṅga's treatise has two complete and one partial. The two complete ones are: first, the time of receiving and entrusting; second, the characteristics of what is received and entrusted;
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c03_19']	一少分者，所攝付法。	一少分者，所攝付法。	001	The one partial one is the method of receiving and entrusting.

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c09_9']	天親論以一頌頌前文義，《菩薩地》說，菩薩已成就有三品，初劫名下品，第二劫名中品，第三劫名上品，唯三品前名未熟。	天親論以一頌頌前文義，《菩薩地》說，菩薩已成就有三品，初劫名下品，第二劫名中品，第三劫名上品，唯三品前名未熟。	001	The treatise by Vasubandhu uses one verse to summarize the meaning of the previous text. The Bodhisattva Stage says that bodhisattvas who have already accomplished the three grades are called the lower grade in the first eon, the middle grade in the second eon, and the upper grade in the third eon. Only the three grades before are called immature.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c13_4']	二發起行相者，發起了於行，謂般若行解，即慧體名相，以無相故，非是相狀，如十六行慧勝得名，三問皆因慧行相，佛所正答，是慧行相。	二發起行相者，發起了於行，謂般若行解，即慧體名相，以無相故，非是相狀，如十六行慧勝得名，三問皆因慧行相，佛所正答，是慧行相。	001	As for the second, the characteristics of the aroused practice, the aroused refers to the aroused practice, namely the practice of prajñā, which is the essence of wisdom and is called characteristics. Because it is without characteristics, it is not a specific form, just as the wisdom of the sixteen aspects is given the name of excellence. The three questions are all due to the characteristics of the practice of wisdom. The correct answer given by the Buddha is the characteristics of the practice of wisdom.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c14_6']	今為問起，名發起於行相，能起佛說慧行相故。	今為問起，名發起於行相，能起佛說慧行相故。	001	Now, the question is called the arousal of the characteristics of practice, because it can arouse the Buddha's explanation of the characteristics of the practice of wisdom.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c16_4']	或此三問皆問所修行之體狀，名為行相，於中修慧雖標總稱，而得自名，別名修行。	或此三問皆問所修行之體狀，名為行相，於中修慧雖標總稱，而得自名，別名修行。	001	Or, the three questions all ask about the specific form of the essence of the practice that is cultivated, which is called the characteristics of practice. Within that, although the cultivation of wisdom is given the general name, it obtains its own name, and the specific name is cultivation.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c19_14']	若依前解，雖諸福智、有無為等皆所修諸法，慧為般若之體，獨得其名，若依後解，唯在有為，無為非行，便成大過，以問有為行，無為自證，亦無有失。	若依前解，雖諸福智、有無為等皆所修諸法，慧為般若之體，獨得其名，若依後解，唯在有為，無為非行，便成大過，以問有為行，無為自證，亦無有失。	001	If based on the former explanation, although all merits, wisdom, unconditioned dharmas, etc. are all the dharmas cultivated, wisdom alone is called prajñā because it is the essence of prajñā. If based on the latter explanation, it only exists in conditioned [dharmas]. Unconditioned [dharmas] are not practices, and it becomes a great error. Because the question is about conditioned practices, and unconditioned [dharmas] are realized by oneself, there is also no fault.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0720c20_23']	以此理微，前解有典據，文有三，初、指文，次、釋三，後、結。	以此理微，前解有典據，文有三，初、指文，次、釋三，後、結。	001	Because this principle is subtle, the former explanation has canonical evidence. The text has three parts: first, pointing out the text; second, explaining; third, concluding.

Samādhi is called samāpatti, which is only concentration, not distraction. It is not common to have or not have mind. This distinguishes it as only taking non-discriminating concentration, not distraction or mindless, correctly cultivating wisdom and dharmas associated with samāpatti. Wisdom associated with non-discriminating concentration is correctly called samādhi and samāpatti.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721a08_3']	有放逸分別生如實覺悟，雖住散位，非無分別，亦不生執，尋當攝念，通等持位及等至位，名降伏心。	有放逸分別生如實覺悟，雖住散位，非無分別，亦不生執，尋當攝念，通等持位及等至位，名降伏心。	001	If careless discrimination arises, although one abides in a distracted state, it is not without discrimination, and one also does not give rise to grasping. One should soon gather one's thoughts, and the states of samādhi and samāpatti are called subduing the mind.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721a10_17']	下文云，乍觀此論，在此文明之，觀此文意，初一聞、思，次一修慧，後一若放逸生心，尋還入定，制之一處，無事不辨。	下文云，乍觀此論，在此文明之，觀此文意，初一聞、思，次一修慧，後一若放逸生心，尋還入定，制之一處，無事不辨。	001	The text below says, At first glance, this treatise is explained in this chapter. Observing the meaning of this text, the first is hearing and thinking, the next is cultivation wisdom, and the last is if careless thoughts arise, one should return to concentration and control them in one place, and nothing will not be discerned.

For this reason, hearing and contemplation are both called able cutters because they subdue.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721a15_10']	又在修位學勝慧時，最初證得心平等性，次後證得明心正直性，最後證得心無功用住性，故為三問。	又在修位學勝慧時，最初證得心平等性，次後證得明心正直性，最後證得心無功用住性，故為三問。	001	Moreover, when one is learning superior wisdom in the stage of cultivation, one first realizes the equality of the mind, next one realizes the clarity and uprightness of the mind, and finally one realizes the effortless abiding of the mind. Therefore, there are three questions.

However, these are only in the causal stage, not in the stage of the Buddha.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721a20_1']	信行地中，三皆有漏；	信行地中，三皆有漏；	001	Among the stage of faith and practice, the three are all with outflows;

Therefore, there is no separate arousing of superior progress. In a single instant, externally there is no negligence in bodily and verbal action. Therefore, this stage is endowed with three kinds of practice.

These are the causes of the transformation body, the reward body, and the Dharma body.

The self-vehicle lineage of bodhisattvas is the first kind of upholding of the nature of being able to endure, because with this as a basis, one is able to realize great enlightenment;

The meanings of the three upholdings are different, not in sequence with this distribution of the text.

How could it also not be possible?
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721b26_9']	天親菩薩明此道理，不得別作無相觀故，修行但說散布施等，三輪清淨修無相行，不說入等至；	天親菩薩明此道理，不得別作無相觀故，修行但說散布施等，三輪清淨修無相行，不說入等至；	001	Bodhisattva Vasubandhu clarifies this principle, because one cannot separately contemplate without characteristics, the cultivation only speaks of the scattering of giving and so forth, and the cultivation of the practice without characteristics of the purification of the three spheres, not speaking of entering meditative absorption;
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721b27_16']	無著菩薩以總觀作無相觀等，說勝解行位，亦作無相等至。	無著菩薩以總觀作無相觀等，說勝解行位，亦作無相等至。	001	Bodhisattva Asanga, because one can generally contemplate without characteristics and so forth, speaks of the stage of resolute practice also performing meditative absorption without characteristics and so forth.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721c02_4']	即以此理，天親菩薩住心初發，修行次生，後降心斷障，方作無相觀，斷分別故，初二聞、思伏，後方修慧斷，故答三問，前後別，文別，修行別別位故。	即以此理，天親菩薩住心初發，修行次生，後降心斷障，方作無相觀，斷分別故，初二聞、思伏，後方修慧斷，故答三問，前後別，文別，修行別別位故。	001	Thus, Asanga Bodhisattva first generates the mind, then practices, and later subdues the afflictions and cuts off the hindrances. Only then does he cultivate the signless contemplation to eliminate discrimination. Therefore, the first two [stages] subdue through hearing and contemplation, and only later does cultivation wisdom eliminate [afflictions]. Thus, the three questions are answered in sequence, the texts are separate, and the practices are separate due to being in different stages.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721c04_8']	無著菩薩以總得作無相觀，修折伏、正斷，俱名為斷，隨應位位皆運得作，故於文文皆答三問。	無著菩薩以總得作無相觀，修折伏、正斷，俱名為斷，隨應位位皆運得作，故於文文皆答三問。	001	Vasubandhu Bodhisattva, on the other hand, takes the attainment of the signless contemplation as a whole, and both the cultivation of subduing and the elimination [of afflictions] are called elimination. He applies this to each stage as appropriate. Therefore, in each text he answers the three questions.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721c06_1']	以有二義故，二論主各各別解，各據一義，亦不相違，合二論義方是。	以有二義故，二論主各各別解，各據一義，亦不相違，合二論義方是。	001	Because there are two meanings, the two commentators each explain separately, each taking one meaning, and they are not contradictory. The combined meaning of the two treatises is correct.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721c09_11']	由此順古，無著一周為利根一人，久修行者樂聞凡夫、十地及佛三位者說，天親二周為鈍根一人，初修者未聞凡夫發心、修行、斷障有疑者說，亦不相違。	由此順古，無著一周為利根一人，久修行者樂聞凡夫、十地及佛三位者說，天親二周為鈍根一人，初修者未聞凡夫發心、修行、斷障有疑者說，亦不相違。	001	Thus, following the ancient interpretation, Asanga taught one cycle for the sake of a single person of sharp faculties who has practiced for a long time and wishes to hear about the stages of ordinary beings, the ten grounds, and the stage of buddhahood, while Vasubandhu taught two cycles for the sake of a single person of dull faculties who is a beginner and has doubts about the mind generation, practice, and elimination of hindrances of ordinary beings that have not been heard. This is also not contradictory.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721c12_17']	由不樂聞十地等行，合說二義，方周備故，經然今給審觀，天親論主作兩周說，讀者自錯，應以無著成就天親，天親義𨷂無著方解，但是捨迷。	由不樂聞十地等行，合說二義，方周備故，經然今給審觀，天親論主作兩周說，讀者自錯，應以無著成就天親，天親義𨷂無著方解，但是捨迷。	001	Because of not delighting in hearing about the practices of the ten grounds, etc., the two meanings are combined and taught, which is complete. However, now carefully examining, the author of the Vasubandhu treatise taught two cycles. The reader is mistaken. It should be that Asanga accomplished Vasubandhu, and only after Vasubandhu's meaning was established did Asanga explain. This is merely abandoning delusion.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0721c13_18']	天親論頌，彌勒所說，無著菩薩豈與相違？	天親論頌，彌勒所說，無著菩薩豈與相違？	001	The verses of Vasubandhu's treatise were spoken by Maitreya. How could Asanga Bodhisattva contradict them?

Those with sharp faculties reach the end in the first and last two times, without attachment in one week, and with two weeks for Vasubandhu. The two treatises have different explanations because they are based on different perspectives.

The text seems to be repeated and confused, and at first it seems to be two weeks, but according to the later explanation of the sutra, there is absolutely no repetition.

Because one attains the ultimate transformation of the basis, it is called the wondrous body. This means that the unconditioned Dharma body is called the attained body, and the reward and transformation bodies are called the accomplished body. Alternatively, the true suchness of one's own enjoyment is called the attained body.

Because they give rise to hindrances in those stages, the stages of severing them, whether innate or conceptual, correspond to them. The ability to subdue them is different from the stages that give rise to them. The hindrances to the stage of Buddhahood arise in the ten grounds. Those before the eighth ground are called giving rise to them. The purity of the lands in the stage of Buddhahood and so forth are common to the three kinds of Buddha lands. Each of these should be fully understood.

They take the objects of enjoyment and the body that enjoys them as one enjoyment. This takes the realm of objects as the enjoyment, and the body and feelings as the enjoyer, distinguishing them separately as the enjoyment and faults, because the body that enjoys and the feelings of the body are all faults.

The correct meaning is according to the second contemplation of enjoyment. Taking the objects of attachment as the beginning, and then speaking of the experiencer, therefore it is known that in the contemplation of self-nature characteristics it is also like this, taking characteristics as the beginning and taking seeing as the next.

The characteristics of views are considered false nature, and the characteristics of consciousness are considered ordinary nature. Attachment to the taste of abiding, and following faults, specifically clarify two types. Not knowing the cause of birth or karma, due to the five external sense objects being what is tasted and attached to, the body that is able to rely on, and the feeling that is able to use, causes faults to arise. Attachment to permanence, self, etc., due to the ability to experience and enjoy, accords with the arising of the three kinds of suffering, but they do not know this.

This is the text below the sutra. This is the treatise's explanation of suffering. Because suffering arises, it is the suffering of suffering. Because pleasant feeling is destroyed, it is the suffering of change. The two kinds of impermanence that are not separate from the previous two are the suffering of conditioned existence.

For this reason, only nine metaphors are explained, neither more nor less, which differ from the eight metaphors and five metaphors, and should be reconciled and explained.

This treatise, in the upper part of the later scroll, in the section on seeking the Buddha-land, says, If a bodhisattva says, 'I accomplish the adornment of the land,' then he is not a bodhisattva.

In this treatise, they are often referred to as the wrong practices of the mind, because they give rise to such thoughts and mental discriminations.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0723b14_14']	第二住處中應行布施，是耶行對治故，共見正行對治方是二執，見謂分別故，分別執著是菩薩煩惱，正是所除。	第二住處中應行布施，是耶行對治故，共見正行對治方是二執，見謂分別故，分別執著是菩薩煩惱，正是所除。	001	In the second stage, one should practice giving, because it is the antidote to wrong practices. The antidote to the two attachments is only the correct practices that are commonly seen. Seeing refers to discrimination, and discrimination and attachment are the afflictions of bodhisattvas, which are precisely what should be eliminated.

First, the answer is: Because the fruits of the three vehicles' enlightenment are each different, only asking about the great one who arouses the mind of the Great Vehicle, because the ultimate fruit of the supreme vehicle is the one to which it ultimately goes, and because it can greatly benefit, not asking about the other two.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0726c13_15']	二答，以能化法化所化生，後得果時，有三身果別，若問發行菩薩乘者，能以三乘法化所化生，令得三菩提，二乘不能，故不為問。	二答，以能化法化所化生，後得果時，有三身果別，若問發行菩薩乘者，能以三乘法化所化生，令得三菩提，二乘不能，故不為問。	001	Second, the answer is that when the Dharma of transformation transforms the beings to be transformed and later attains the fruition, there are three bodies of fruition that are different. If one asks those who set out on the bodhisattva vehicle, they can transform the beings to be transformed with the Dharma of the Three Vehicles and enable them to attain the three kinds of enlightenment. The two vehicles cannot do this, so it is not asked.

This is because it is mixed up in the words.

It is not the fruit of separation, because its essence is attained through causes. Even without a Buddha, it can still be attained. Because it is not ultimate, it is not wished to be given.

Next, the answer says it is because it is a shared fruit. That nirvana with remainder, whether there is a body that is the basis of suffering or not, is all attained together.

The reason for not explaining the nirvāṇa of skillful means is explained by two causes. Because it is not one-sided, the reason for not explaining the nirvāṇa with remainder is explained by one cause, namely, that worldly beings attain that partial nirvāṇa not only by the power of the fruit of the man of great capacity, but also because of past karma and frequent practice as a cause, they are able to enter it in the present, like spontaneously attaining it at the time of the destruction of the eon.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729b18_11']	又如下地曾習次上地定，退生次下地，生已彼下地，由宿習力，任運漸習，上定現前。	又如下地曾習次上地定，退生次下地，生已彼下地，由宿習力，任運漸習，上定現前。	001	Moreover, it is like the case of having previously practiced the concentration of the next higher stage in the lower stages. Having regressed and been reborn in the next lower stage, due to the power of past practice, one spontaneously gradually practices and the concentration of the higher stage appears in the present.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729b19_1']	豈無餘滅亦宿業得？	豈無餘滅亦宿業得？	001	How is it that the nirvāṇa without remainder is also attained due to past karma?
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729b20_19']	其無餘涅槃要由外緣聞法力等，值佛說得，不同彼分方便涅槃不待佛說，方便而得。	其無餘涅槃要由外緣聞法力等，值佛說得，不同彼分方便涅槃不待佛說，方便而得。	001	As for nirvāṇa without remainder, it is necessary to rely on external conditions, such as the power of hearing the Dharma, and to encounter the Buddha's teaching in order to attain it. It is not the same as the nirvāṇa with remainder attained through skillful means, which does not depend on the Buddha's teaching but is attained through skillful means.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729b24_3']	又無餘涅槃一得已後，圓滿安樂，更無微苦，其有餘涅槃，惑業雖盡，苦依未除，而非一向果，「身苦有餘故」，故但說無餘，不說二涅槃。	又無餘涅槃一得已後，圓滿安樂，更無微苦，其有餘涅槃，惑業雖盡，苦依未除，而非一向果，「身苦有餘故」，故但說無餘，不說二涅槃。	001	Moreover, after attaining nirvāṇa without remainder, one is in perfect peace and bliss, with no trace of suffering. As for nirvāṇa with remainder, although afflictions and karma are exhausted, the basis of suffering has not yet been removed, and it is not a one-sided fruition. Because the body suffers with remainder, therefore only nirvāṇa without remainder is mentioned, and not the two nirvāṇas.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729b26_9']	此通三乘二涅槃義，若依佛位，有漏身智無名無餘依涅槃，無漏身智在名為有餘滅，便無是義。	此通三乘二涅槃義，若依佛位，有漏身智無名無餘依涅槃，無漏身智在名為有餘滅，便無是義。	001	This is the meaning of the two nirvāṇas common to the three vehicles. If based on the stage of a Buddha, the contaminated body and wisdom are not called nirvāṇa without remainder, and the uncontaminated body and wisdom remaining is called nirvāṇa with remainder. Then this meaning does not exist.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c01_6']	上來已說不說彼分、有餘所由，細料簡者，由度三乘，不說令得大般涅槃及無住處及三別相、自性清淨并大菩提，論中以經說發大心所度令得三乘通化，故但簡二。	上來已說不說彼分、有餘所由，細料簡者，由度三乘，不說令得大般涅槃及無住處及三別相、自性清淨并大菩提，論中以經說發大心所度令得三乘通化，故但簡二。	001	The above has already explained the reasons for not explaining the aspects and having remainder. The subtle analysis is due to crossing over the three vehicles, not explaining the attainment of great parinirvāṇa, the abode of non-abiding, and the three distinct characteristics, the nature of purity, and great enlightenment. In the treatise, it is said in the sūtra that those who give rise to the great mind are crossed over and made to attain the three vehicles in common. Therefore, only two are distinguished.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c02_9']	今彼如有餘，三乘通得，餘非涅槃，論亦自說非究竟。	今彼如有餘，三乘通得，餘非涅槃，論亦自說非究竟。	001	Now, as it is said to have remainder, the three vehicles are attained in common. The remainder is not nirvāṇa. The treatise also says itself that it is not ultimate.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c04_5']	第四結釋不說二涅槃所以，初、牒二涅槃，次、別以四因結，後、總結是故說無餘。	第四結釋不說二涅槃所以，初、牒二涅槃，次、別以四因結，後、總結是故說無餘。	001	The fourth concludes and explains the reason for not explaining the two nirvāṇas. First, it cites the two nirvāṇas. Next, it concludes with four reasons. Finally, it concludes by saying therefore, it is said to have remainder.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c06_10']	一、「丈夫力果故」，二、「非究竟果故」，即前習業果，其究竟果必加行因得故，此二因結釋不說方便涅槃。	一、「丈夫力果故」，二、「非究竟果故」，即前習業果，其究竟果必加行因得故，此二因結釋不說方便涅槃。	001	The first is because it is the fruit of the power of the hero. The second is because it is not the ultimate fruit. This is the previously cultivated karmic fruit. The ultimate fruit must be attained through the cause of added effort. These two reasons conclude and explain the non-explanation of the nirvāṇa of skillful means.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c07_20']	一、是「共果故」，二、「非一向果故」，此二因結釋不說方便、有餘涅槃。	一、是「共果故」，二、「非一向果故」，此二因結釋不說方便、有餘涅槃。	001	First, because it is a common fruit, second, because it is not a one-sided fruit. These two reasons conclude and explain why the nirvana with remainder and without skillful means is not mentioned.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c10_3']	總結是故，但說無餘，便無是過，其無住處及大般涅槃，大乘得，二乘定性皆所不得，亦不說與。	總結是故，但說無餘，便無是過，其無住處及大般涅槃，大乘得，二乘定性皆所不得，亦不說與。	001	The general conclusion is therefore only speaking of the nirvana without remainder, which is without fault. As for the abode of no-abode and the great parinirvāṇa, the Mahāyāna attains both, while the two vehicles with fixed natures do not attain either, and it is also not said that they attain them.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c12_15']	然《菩薩地》及《善戒經》第一卷，初發心願大般涅槃及大菩提，與此全別，此同《華嚴經》初發心位願得無餘，略有三解。	然《菩薩地》及《善戒經》第一卷，初發心願大般涅槃及大菩提，與此全別，此同《華嚴經》初發心位願得無餘，略有三解。	001	However, the Bodhisattva Stage and the Sutra of Good Admonitions, volume one, initially vowing for the great parinirvāṇa and great enlightenment, are completely different from this. This is the same as the initial stage of vowing to attain the nirvana without remainder in the Flower Ornament Sutra. There are roughly three explanations.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c14_1']	一云，彼即同此說，大乘無餘涅槃勝故，影彰亦得菩提。	一云，彼即同此說，大乘無餘涅槃勝故，影彰亦得菩提。	001	One says that they are the same as this explanation, because the nirvana without remainder of the Mahāyāna is superior, and it is indirectly indicated that one also attains enlightenment.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c14_19']	二云，此依種性，非皆得佛，故得無餘。	二云，此依種性，非皆得佛，故得無餘。	001	Second, this is based on the spiritual capacities, and not all attain Buddhahood, therefore they attain the nirvana without remainder.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c15_13']	彼說意，想願作佛，亦不相違。	彼說意，想願作佛，亦不相違。	001	The intention of that explanation is to think and vow to become a Buddha, which is also not contradictory.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c16_6']	三云，初猶未解，彼願皆得。	三云，初猶未解，彼願皆得。	001	The third says, At first they still do not understand, but they all attain that vow.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c18_13']	此依種性不說菩提，此皆發願故略不問，亦不願得自性清淨涅槃，彼已舊成，不須問說，故但簡二。	此依種性不說菩提，此皆發願故略不問，亦不願得自性清淨涅槃，彼已舊成，不須問說，故但簡二。	001	This relies on the spiritual lineage and does not speak of enlightenment. This is all making vows, so it is not asked in brief, and also does not vow to attain the intrinsically pure nirvana. That has already been accomplished for a long time, so there is no need to ask or speak about it, so it only distinguishes the two.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0729c20_13']	第三段解常心中分三，初、解經牒已所度生，次、正顯常行，後、釋成常義。	第三段解常心中分三，初、解經牒已所度生，次、正顯常行，後、釋成常義。	001	The third section explains the mind of permanence and divides it into three parts. First, it explains the sutra's citation of the beings already liberated. Next, it reveals the constant practice. Finally, it establishes the meaning of permanence.

Although he liberates and enters cessation, it is like the bodhisattva's own body entering nirvana. He does not see any sentient beings separate from his body, so it is a constant practice.

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0730a10_4']	下解證道等中，由諸菩薩證真智，後得攝諸有情同自性意，令初發心設雖未證亦依此解，由無此彼，不生勞倦，故能常度。	下解證道等中，由諸菩薩證真智，後得攝諸有情同自性意，令初發心設雖未證亦依此解，由無此彼，不生勞倦，故能常度。	001	Below, in the explanation of the path of realization, etc., due to the bodhisattvas realizing true wisdom, the subsequent attainment of taking in all sentient beings the same as their own nature, causing the initial generation of the mind, although not yet realized, also relies on this understanding, because without this they do not give rise to weariness, therefore they are always able to liberate.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0730a11_14']	若見身外有別眾生，無同體意，執生勞倦，便不能度，設度不常。	若見身外有別眾生，無同體意，執生勞倦，便不能度，設度不常。	001	If seeing outside the body there are separate sentient beings, without the intention of the same essence, grasping gives rise to weariness, then they are not able to liberate, even if liberating it is not constant.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0730a14_4']	故《辨中邊》十六空中畢竟空云，「為常益有情」，由觀有情畢竟皆空，故能常益，此亦如是，不見身外有眾生故。	故《辨中邊》十六空中畢竟空云，「為常益有情」，由觀有情畢竟皆空，故能常益，此亦如是，不見身外有眾生故。	001	Therefore the Discernment of the Middle Way says in the sixteen emptinesses, ultimate emptiness means for the sake of constantly benefiting sentient beings. Because contemplating sentient beings are ultimately all empty, therefore able to constantly benefit, this is also like this, because not seeing outside the body there are sentient beings.

Later, in the Xianqing era, the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was translated at Yuhua Monastery, and compared with four Sanskrit versions, all of which only spoke of four.

Based on this, it is known that the sutra itself has extensive, concise, and intermediate differences. Du Xingyi's extensive version, the text of the Prajñāpradīpa Commentary is concise, the Khotanese version and Kumārajīva's text are the same, and the intermediate one is the Indian version, the same as Paramārtha's and Jñānagupta's versions. The Yuhua Monastery's retranslation also has a similar text.

What was done in the past, I fear, is extremely erroneous. Later, when hidden in Yuhua, it was translated again. Therefore, the various versions have different additions and deletions. Learners should know this.

How can he be called a bodhisattva?

Not means no. Because bodhisattvas have no grasping and clinging to sentient beings, etc., there is no self, others, or one who transforms and those to be transformed. This is the meaning of the sutra, and therefore it is not inverted.

Above, the desire and vow do not even abide in attachment. The samādhi and samāpatti that gather and disperse are also like this. One should be like the initial non-abiding in giving. Therefore, there is the word like. Or, based on true reality, because the nature is without attachment, the thought of giving should not abide in accordance with reality.

Because of craving for merit and virtue, they are able to practice giving.

The giving that does not abide in characteristics, when one attains the fruit later, its form is high above, because the uncontaminated dharmas transcend the three realms, and its form is vast horizontally, because it fills the ten directions;

Having just heard of the pure giving of the three wheels without characteristics, they give rise to doubt. For example, since the body of Śākyamuni Buddha has the characteristics of arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing, it is known that the cause of giving with characteristics will still produce a fruit with characteristics. Therefore,

If one practices giving with characteristics and attains it, and practices without characteristics and does not abide in the cause of the Dharma, one should still attain the fruit of non-abiding without characteristics. How can one attain the fruit of birth and cessation?

In order to eliminate this pride, the following sutra passage is presented.

The three bodies of the Buddha's fruition and the causes of merit and wisdom are all included in the Dharma body. The spoken teachings of sound are not the Dharma body. The causes of the Dharma body are also called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0735b01_7']	如說般若，實相、觀照正是般若，文字般若能生、能顯般若，亦名般若。	如說般若，實相、觀照正是般若，文字般若能生、能顯般若，亦名般若。	001	It is like speaking of prajñā. The true aspect and contemplation are the actual prajñā. The written prajñā can give rise to and reveal prajñā, and is also called prajñā.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0735b02_10']	此亦如是，文字能顯、能生法身，故稱言說亦名法身。	此亦如是，文字能顯、能生法身，故稱言說亦名法身。	001	This is also like this. The written [teachings] can reveal and give rise to the Dharma body, and therefore the spoken [teachings] are also called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0735b05_3']	文字般若從能詮辨能依作用以立其名，言說法身從能詮表所依、能依體用和合以立其名，聲名等合名言說故。	文字般若從能詮辨能依作用以立其名，言說法身從能詮表所依、能依體用和合以立其名，聲名等合名言說故。	001	The prajñā of letters is named based on its ability to expound and its dependent function, while the dharma body of speech is named based on its ability to reveal the union of the essence and function of the dependent and the supported, because speech is the combination of sound, words, and so forth.

['ZH_T40_1816_001:0735b11_1']	由此欲得色身等已下文，不名離障，但名欲得，非疑極障，故說欲得色身是慢障法。	由此欲得色身等已下文，不名離障，但名欲得，非疑極障，故說欲得色身是慢障法。	001	For this reason, the text below wanting to attain the form body is not called free from obstacles, but only wanting to attain, because doubt is not the ultimate obstacle, so it is said that wanting to attain the form body is the dharma of the obstacle of pride.

It means that the previously mentioned non-abiding practice of giving is the profound meaning of the cause, and next it is said that the Dharma body is not the characteristic of the conditioned is the profound meaning of the effect. The cause is profound and the effect is distant, and the meaning is difficult to know.

In the evil world of the final Dharma, if there is no faith or confusion, it only asks whether or not faith can be generated when the semblance Dharma is about to perish.

Because it is not the final Dharma, because there are practices such as upholding precepts, concentration, and wisdom, they are all not superior, so this is questioned. Because in the final Dharma there are none who cultivate the three learnings, therefore it is not asked about.

This treatise, based on the cause, desires to speak of the Dharma body and to realize the basis of the attainment of the Dharma body, which will circulate in the world in the future, and will give rise to the subsequent sūtra, therefore there is no contradiction.

Subhūti hears that the profound and wondrous true reality is difficult to know. It is acceptable for the Buddha to be present, and many people have faith. The superior can be known through the time, capacity, illness, and practice. After the Buddha's passing, can there still be faith?

It means that the nature of this ultimate truth is beyond words, neither empty nor not empty. Grasping it as empty existence is called a sign. Now, it is denied in both ways, so it is said to be signless. It shows that this true principle cannot be said to have the signs of existence or emptiness.

If one turns the mind to the stage of no-more-learning, the grasping of self is already absent, and the grasping of dharmas is now subdued.

Even if at this stage, in the mind grasping dharmas, there is no actual grasping of the self, it is still followed by the seeds of grasping the self, and will definitely manifest later. This is called having the grasping of the self.

This is because they are coarse and easy to subdue. However, due to the existence of the seeds of the thought of grasping the self, which have not been eliminated, and because of following the grasping of dharmas, it is also called having the grasping of the self.
['ZH_T40_1816_001:0738b18_13']	故天親云，「但有無明使，無現行麁煩惱，示無我見」，無我見者，現行不起也。	故天親云，「但有無明使，無現行麁煩惱，示無我見」，無我見者，現行不起也。	001	Therefore, Vasubandhu says, There is only the latent tendency of ignorance, not the actual coarse afflictions. It shows the absence of the view of self. The view of self means that it does not arise in the present moment.

Therefore, this treatise says, Because conceptualization and its support do not occur, the existence of their seeds is called having latent tendencies, also called afflictions, and called having the grasping of self, etc.

This is not explained in terms of the noble ones in training, etc., because they do not exist at that time. Therefore, it says, If one grasps the grasping of dharmas, etc., it is called the grasping of self, etc. It is only explained in terms of the evil times of ordinary beings, etc. Therefore, we know that the afflictive obstructions take the grasping of dharmas as their basis.
