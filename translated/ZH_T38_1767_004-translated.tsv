['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a09_17']	一切眾生即是理常，聞大涅槃解知佛性即名字常，知性能修即觀行常，如夜見杌即相似常，金錍抉眼三指分明即分真常，無上大覺即究竟常。	一切眾生即是理常，聞大涅槃解知佛性即名字常，知性能修即觀行常，如夜見杌即相似常，金錍抉眼三指分明即分真常，無上大覺即究竟常。	004	All sentient beings are the principle permanence. Hearing the great nirvana and understanding the Buddha-nature is the permanence of names and words. Knowing the nature can be cultivated is the permanence of contemplation. Like seeing a stump at night is the permanence of similarity. The golden spatula opens the eyes and the three fingers are distinct, which is the permanence of partial truth.

['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a17_14']	初一難具論自他，後四難唯論於自。	初一難具論自他，後四難唯論於自。	004	The first difficulty is fully discussed in terms of self and others, while the latter four difficulties are only discussed in terms of self.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a18_18']	此難本明受者福他，初既備舉後不煩文，是故略之。	此難本明受者福他，初既備舉後不煩文，是故略之。	004	This difficulty originally clarifies the blessings of the recipient for others. Since the first one has already been fully presented, the later ones are not elaborated in the text. Therefore, they are omitted.

['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a19_19']	至理寂滅無大無小；	至理寂滅無大無小；	004	The ultimate truth is tranquil extinction, neither great nor small;
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a21_13']	若垂迹化物，緣有利鈍、應有勝劣，小緣所見初後俱劣、大緣所見初後俱勝。	若垂迹化物，緣有利鈍、應有勝劣，小緣所見初後俱劣、大緣所見初後俱勝。	004	If one manifests traces to transform beings, there are sharp and dull capacities, and there are superior and inferior responses. Those with small capacities see the beginning and end as both inferior, while those with great capacities see the beginning and end as both superior.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a23_1']	若始坐樹下受牧女乳麋食，此食已十力充滿，此小緣劣見。	若始坐樹下受牧女乳麋食，此食已十力充滿，此小緣劣見。	004	If one first sits under the tree and accepts the milk gruel from the cowherd woman, after eating this, the ten powers are filled. This is seen by those with small capacities and inferior views.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a26_13']	若始坐華臺，眷屬菩薩悉坐華葉，十方諸佛放眉間光入華臺頂，諸佛眷屬放眉間光入華葉頂，華臺菩薩三昧受職成於報佛，華葉菩薩成於應佛，此大緣見勝。	若始坐華臺，眷屬菩薩悉坐華葉，十方諸佛放眉間光入華臺頂，諸佛眷屬放眉間光入華葉頂，華臺菩薩三昧受職成於報佛，華葉菩薩成於應佛，此大緣見勝。	004	If one begins sitting on the flower platform, the bodhisattvas in the retinue all sit on the flower petals. The buddhas of the ten directions emit light from between their eyebrows and enter the crown of the flower platform. The buddhas in the retinue emit light from between their eyebrows and enter the crowns of the flower petals. The bodhisattvas on the flower platform attain the position of the reward buddha through samādhi and acceptance of the position, while the bodhisattvas on the flower petals attain the position of the response buddha. This is the superior view of the great causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058a28_4']	當知牧女與諸佛不同，乳麋與光明永異，此即大小二佛最初受施。	當知牧女與諸佛不同，乳麋與光明永異，此即大小二佛最初受施。	004	One should know that the cowherd woman is not the same as the buddhas, and the gruel is completely different from the light. This is the first time the buddhas, large and small, accept offerings.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b01_2']	若見佛自行乞食，到純陀舍食檀耳羹，中夜入滅輿向雙林以火焚身，此小緣劣見。	若見佛自行乞食，到純陀舍食檀耳羹，中夜入滅輿向雙林以火焚身，此小緣劣見。	004	If one sees the Buddha personally begging for food, eating a soup of mushrooms at Cunda's house, entering nirvana in the middle of the night, and being carried to the twin trees to be cremated, this is the inferior view of the small causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b03_9']	若見純陀悲感，但獻八斛四斗不思議供充飽一切，見十方佛遣大弟子鉢盛香飯奉佛涅槃，大緣見勝。	若見純陀悲感，但獻八斛四斗不思議供充飽一切，見十方佛遣大弟子鉢盛香飯奉佛涅槃，大緣見勝。	004	If one sees Cunda's sorrowful offering of eight bushels and four pecks of inconceivable offerings that satisfy everyone, and sees the buddhas of the ten directions sending their great disciples with fragrant food in their bowls to offer to the Buddha in nirvana, this is the superior view of the great causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b05_2']	當知乞食與送食不同，香飯與檀耳永異，大小二佛最後受施其相若此。	當知乞食與送食不同，香飯與檀耳永異，大小二佛最後受施其相若此。	004	One should know that begging for food is different from having food delivered, and fragrant rice is completely different from agaric. The appearances of the two Buddhas, great and small, receiving offerings for the last time are like this.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b05_16']	例推智斷，乃至五果亦應各異。	例推智斷，乃至五果亦應各異。	004	By analogy, wisdom and elimination, up to the five fruits, should also be different.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b08_3']	純陀芰角將大緣之後並小緣之初構差別之難，佛約大緣所見初後無差以答，則涇渭皎然、初後不二。	純陀芰角將大緣之後並小緣之初構差別之難，佛約大緣所見初後無差以答，則涇渭皎然、初後不二。	004	Pure Giving, like a unicorn, is at the end of the great affinity and the beginning of the small affinity, raising the difficulty of discrimination. The Buddha, based on the great affinity, sees no difference between the beginning and end, and answers with this. Then the Jing and Wei are clearly distinguished, and the beginning and end are not two.

['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b14_15']	前後既現四相不同，例推智斷，乃至五果亦應各異。	前後既現四相不同，例推智斷，乃至五果亦應各異。	004	Since the four appearances are manifested differently before and after, by analogy, wisdom, elimination, and even the five fruits should also be different.

['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b17_7']	凡法未離不得聖號，苦行體羸外須雜食；	凡法未離不得聖號，苦行體羸外須雜食；	004	The Dharma of an ordinary person is not yet free and does not receive the title of sage. The body of austerities is weak and needs external nourishment.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b18_2']	無漏未發內有煩惱，果縛尚在；	無漏未發內有煩惱，果縛尚在；	004	The uncontaminated has not yet arisen, and internally there are afflictions. The bondage of the fruit still exists.
['ZH_T38_1767_004:0058b18_16']	是後邊身必歸磨滅，是無常身。	是後邊身必歸磨滅，是無常身。	004	This is the final body and will surely return to destruction. This is an impermanent body.

Constancy is the head of this teaching, therefore it is surpassed and answered.
