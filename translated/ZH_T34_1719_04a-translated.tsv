['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a12_2']	何在？	何在？	In the explanation, first explaining the principles, it says The principles are true suchness to being real. Where is the reality of the principles?

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a16_8']	「集起名心，思量名意，了別名識」，在彼一向全無即理，若大乘中八識名心，七識名意，六識名識，彼教為迷又無即理，故偏小教；	「集起名心，思量名意，了別名識」，在彼一向全無即理，若大乘中八識名心，七識名意，六識名識，彼教為迷又無即理，故偏小教；	The accumulation and arising is called mind, the deliberation is called thought, and the discrimination is called consciousness. In that [teaching], if it is completely non-existent, it is the principles. If it is the eight consciousnesses in the Mahayana, the seventh consciousness is called thought, and the sixth consciousness is called consciousness. That teaching is also non-existent in the principles for the deluded. Therefore, it is the biased and small teaching;
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a18_12']	有漏之法全無性淨，即常住理知之者寡，故知有漏雖緣淨等，同屬於事，具如事理不二門明。	有漏之法全無性淨，即常住理知之者寡，故知有漏雖緣淨等，同屬於事，具如事理不二門明。	The dharmas with outflows completely lack the nature of purity, which is the principle of permanence. Those who know this are few. Therefore, it is known that although the dharmas with outflows rely on purity, etc., they belong to phenomena together. It is fully explained in the chapter on the non-duality of phenomena and principles.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a21_9']	故所以中云「非理無以立事，事有顯理之功」，故稱歎方便，誰肯以三界有漏心等，以為如來之所稱歎〈方便品〉耶？	故所以中云「非理無以立事，事有顯理之功」，故稱歎方便，誰肯以三界有漏心等，以為如來之所稱歎〈方便品〉耶？	Therefore, in the Reasons section it says, Without principle, events cannot be established. Events have the function of revealing principle. Therefore, it praises skillful means. Who would dare to take the defiled mind of the three realms and so forth as what the Tathāgata praises in the chapter on skillful means?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a22_3']	若不爾者，為令眾生其義安在？	若不爾者，為令眾生其義安在？	If it were not so, where would the meaning of causing sentient beings lie?

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a24_19']	初云「總前事理」者，合前理惑也。	初云「總前事理」者，合前理惑也。	First, it says combining the previous events and principle combines the previous principle and delusion.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a27_1']	故知無明法性乃至界外一切諸法皆是所詮，此心意識名之與體，具足一切界外法故。	故知無明法性乃至界外一切諸法皆是所詮，此心意識名之與體，具足一切界外法故。	Therefore, know that ignorance, the nature of dharmas, and all dharmas outside the realms are all that is expounded. This mind, thought, and consciousness, the name and essence, are fully endowed with all dharmas outside the realms.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a27_19']	誰知《法華》之教，以此等法而為所詮？	誰知《法華》之教，以此等法而為所詮？	Who knows that the teaching of the Lotus Sūtra takes these dharmas as what is expounded?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215a28_17']	若不爾者，邪見嚴王、惡逆調達從何而得？	若不爾者，邪見嚴王、惡逆調達從何而得？	If it were not so, from where would the king of wrong views and the evil-reverse Devadatta have come?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b06_9']	次舉例者，此即舉解以例於迷，解理之時真俗俱諦解由迷得，故於迷中且名事理，由詮此理而得成教，以理望教教名為權，理在於迷迷亦名實，故權實之名非一處得，果教譚此能詮亦權，故知其教秖詮其理，是故如來稱歎此教，自非今經誰肯歎此詮迷之教為方便品？	次舉例者，此即舉解以例於迷，解理之時真俗俱諦解由迷得，故於迷中且名事理，由詮此理而得成教，以理望教教名為權，理在於迷迷亦名實，故權實之名非一處得，果教譚此能詮亦權，故知其教秖詮其理，是故如來稱歎此教，自非今經誰肯歎此詮迷之教為方便品？	Next, in the example, this is using understanding to exemplify delusion. When understanding the principle, both the true and the mundane are truths. Understanding is obtained through delusion, so in delusion it is provisionally called phenomena and principle. Due to expounding this principle, the teaching is accomplished. From the perspective of the teaching, the teaching is called provisional. The principle in delusion is also called real. Therefore, the names provisional and real are not obtained in one place. The fruition teaching discusses this expounder as also provisional. Therefore, know that the teaching only expounds the principle. For this reason, the Tathāgata praises this teaching. If it were not for the present sūtra, who would be willing to praise this teaching that expounds delusion as the chapter on skillful means?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b07_5']	若不爾者，從三昧起所歎者何？	若不爾者，從三昧起所歎者何？	If it were not so, what would be praised after arising from samādhi?

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b08_7']	圓漸者何？	圓漸者何？	What is the perfect and gradual?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b10_14']	謂七方便，還指漸漸即是圓漸，故教定行移、行權教實，故言「教無進趣」，況教詮實相，實相之理無復淺深。	謂七方便，還指漸漸即是圓漸，故教定行移、行權教實，故言「教無進趣」，況教詮實相，實相之理無復淺深。	That is, the seven approaches are still pointed out as gradual, which is the same as perfect gradual. Therefore, the teaching is fixed and the practice is provisional. Therefore, it is said that the teaching has no progress. Moreover, the teaching explains the true aspect, and the principle of the true aspect has no shallow or deep.

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b11_10']	若無淺深，應當無復詮行教耶？	若無淺深，應當無復詮行教耶？	If there is no shallow or deep, then there should be no teaching that explains practice, right?

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b13_8']	教有二種，詮理之教無二，表行之教自分，秖緣行有差殊，致詮行教小別。	教有二種，詮理之教無二，表行之教自分，秖緣行有差殊，致詮行教小別。	There are two kinds of teachings. The teaching that explains principle is non-dual. The teaching that expresses practice is divided. It is precisely because there are differences in practice that the teaching that explains practice is slightly different.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b14_7']	又能詮教亦無進趣，所詮之行自階差耳。	又能詮教亦無進趣，所詮之行自階差耳。	Moreover, the teaching that can be expressed also has no progress. The practice that is expressed itself has levels.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b15_6']	若不爾者，如來方便波羅蜜等何所證耶？	若不爾者，如來方便波羅蜜等何所證耶？	If it were not so, then what would the Tathāgata's skillful means pāramitās and so forth be realized?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b16_15']	次縛脫者，行名猶通仍兼違順，故以縛脫而甄權實，名為縛脫。	次縛脫者，行名猶通仍兼違順，故以縛脫而甄權實，名為縛脫。	Next, as for bondage and liberation, the name practice is still general and still involves opposition and compliance. Therefore, bondage and liberation are used to distinguish the provisional and the real. The name is called bondage and liberation.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b17_15']	又通昔者，諸經地前尚自違理，未開權故；	又通昔者，諸經地前尚自違理，未開權故；	Moreover, in the past, in various sūtras, those below the ground stage were still in opposition to principle, because the provisional had not yet been revealed.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b18_10']	此經彈指無非佛因，以顯實故。	此經彈指無非佛因，以顯實故。	Every snap of the fingers in this sutra is a cause of Buddhahood, because it reveals the truth.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b19_9']	誰知此經，佛以惡行亦得名為善巧方便？	誰知此經，佛以惡行亦得名為善巧方便？	Who would have known that the Buddha considers even evil conduct to be skillful means?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b20_10']	死屍之譬遍通一切，具如修性不二門明。	死屍之譬遍通一切，具如修性不二門明。	The analogy of the corpse applies to everything, as explained in detail in the chapter on the non-duality of cultivation and nature.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b20_15']	因果中三：	因果中三：	There are three parts in the section on cause and effect:
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b21_17']	初正釋，次「無果」下所以，三「二觀」下釋成。	初正釋，次「無果」下所以，三「二觀」下釋成。	First, the correct explanation; second, the reason why there is no effect; third, the explanation of the two contemplations.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b23_15']	釋成中云「二觀為方便」者，且約法示相、借權例顯，一一重中通攝諸教，豈可定局別二觀耶？	釋成中云「二觀為方便」者，且約法示相、借權例顯，一一重中通攝諸教，豈可定局別二觀耶？	In the explanation, it says the two contemplations are used as skillful means. This is just using the Dharma to show the characteristics and borrowing the provisional to illustrate. Each layer includes all teachings. How can it be limited to the two separate contemplations?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b25_14']	如體用漸頓開合通別中，亦有諸教體用等法，從體起用、從頓開漸、從漸合頓等。	如體用漸頓開合通別中，亦有諸教體用等法，從體起用、從頓開漸、從漸合頓等。	In the section on the essence, function, gradual, sudden, opening, merging, common, and distinct, there are also the teachings on the essence, function, etc. of the Dharma. The function arises from the essence, the gradual is opened from the sudden, the sudden is merged from the gradual, and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b27_2']	次體用者，還指初住為隨分果，此果即有百界之用。	次體用者，還指初住為隨分果，此果即有百界之用。	Next, the essence and function refers to the initial stage of abiding as the partial effect. This effect has the function of the hundred realms.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215b29_3']	言「立一切法」者，前事理中即以染緣為一切法，此中即是淨緣諸法，具如染淨不二門明。	言「立一切法」者，前事理中即以染緣為一切法，此中即是淨緣諸法，具如染淨不二門明。	As for establishing all dharmas, in the previous principle and phenomena, one takes defiled conditions as all dharmas. Here, it is the pure conditions of various dharmas, which are fully explained in the chapter on the non-duality of defilement and purity.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c02_7']	次漸頓中，一者自他俱有漸頓，二者化他起用義兼權實並體內權，為此利他權實法故須明開合。	次漸頓中，一者自他俱有漸頓，二者化他起用義兼權實並體內權，為此利他權實法故須明開合。	Next, in gradual and sudden, first, there is gradual and sudden in terms of oneself and others. Second, in terms of transforming others, the arising of function is inclusive of provisional and real, both of which are provisional within the essence. For the sake of this Dharma of provisional and real for benefiting others, it is necessary to clarify the distinctions and unity.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c03_7']	開合者，漸自不合者，藏通兩教不廢小故；	開合者，漸自不合者，藏通兩教不廢小故；	As for distinctions and unity, the gradual is not united in itself. This is because the two teachings of the Tripiṭaka and Shared do not discard the Small Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c04_4']	亦不合頓者，三教菩薩不入實故。	亦不合頓者，三教菩薩不入實故。	It is also not united with the sudden, because the bodhisattvas of the three teachings do not enter the real.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c06_11']	次通別者，前漸頓門漸中雖有半教，半在漸初今半通後，悉檀即是判前體用乃至通別，准前以釋。	次通別者，前漸頓門漸中雖有半教，半在漸初今半通後，悉檀即是判前體用乃至通別，准前以釋。	Next, in terms of common and distinct, although the half teaching is included in the gradual in the previous gradual and sudden approach, the other half is at the beginning of the gradual. Now the general principle is after the half, and the four siddhāntas are precisely the judgment of the previous essence and function, up to the common and distinct, following the previous to explain.

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c14_18']	初簡意者簡通從別，十雙一一具諸教味，若有不明事理乃至悉檀者，信非佛教，且從相待故簡通從別。	初簡意者簡通從別，十雙一一具諸教味，若有不明事理乃至悉檀者，信非佛教，且從相待故簡通從別。	First, distinguishing the meaning is to distinguish the general from the specific. Each of the ten pairs is fully endowed with the various teachings and flavors. If there is any lack of understanding of phenomena and principles, up to the upāya, it is not believed to be the Buddha's teachings. For now, it is distinguished from the general to the specific.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c16_2']	次正引者，初事理中云「不如三界」者，謂不同也。	次正引者，初事理中云「不如三界」者，謂不同也。	Next, the correct citation, first in the phenomena and principles, it says not like the three realms, meaning not the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c16_16']	始自二乘並異三界，未足辨今；	始自二乘並異三界，未足辨今；	Starting from the two vehicles, all are different from the three realms, but this is not sufficient to distinguish the present;
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c19_4']	今從上句「非如非異」來成此文，故與方便教事理不同，理教中理云寂滅者，真俗二理不可說故。	今從上句「非如非異」來成此文，故與方便教事理不同，理教中理云寂滅者，真俗二理不可說故。	Now, from the previous sentence neither the same nor different comes to form this text, so it is different from the expedient teachings in terms of phenomena and principles. In the principle of the teachings, the principle of quiescent extinction is because the two principles of truth and conventionality cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c22_14']	次教中舉「五比丘」者，從漸初說，亦應須云「若無性者為說人天，乃至脩羅為下品善，乃至為說無作四諦」，故知從理俱不可說，從事大小俱可得說。	次教中舉「五比丘」者，從漸初說，亦應須云「若無性者為說人天，乃至脩羅為下品善，乃至為說無作四諦」，故知從理俱不可說，從事大小俱可得說。	Next, in the teachings, mentioning the five bhikshus is speaking from the beginning of the gradual [teachings]. It should also be said, If there are those without [the capacity for] the nature [of Buddhahood], [the Buddha] speaks of humans and gods, up to asuras, for the sake of the lower grade of goodness, up to speaking of the four noble truths without [the need for] practice. Therefore, it is known that from the principle, [the teachings] are both not able to be spoken of, but from the phenomena, [the teachings] are both able to be spoken of in terms of the greater and lesser [vehicles].
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c23_12']	證教行者，若聞證教、善行證行。	證教行者，若聞證教、善行證行。	As for the practice of realizing the teachings, if one hears the teachings of realization, one skillfully practices the practice of realization.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c25_17']	「汝等」下二文並皆證行，應廣約此經以明善行作佛之相，種種之言義含教行，以有今昔因緣故也。	「汝等」下二文並皆證行，應廣約此經以明善行作佛之相，種種之言義含教行，以有今昔因緣故也。	In the two texts below you all, both [the Buddha] certifies and practices. It should be extensively explained based on this sutra to clarify the characteristics of skillful practice that lead to becoming a Buddha. The word various contains the meanings of teachings and practices, because there are causes and conditions of the present and the past.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c29_3']	次「但離」下證縛脫者，但離等者小中離妄名為解脫，即以虛妄名之為縛，小雖解脫非一切脫，小脫於大仍名為縛，故云「未得此證」。	次「但離」下證縛脫者，但離等者小中離妄名為解脫，即以虛妄名之為縛，小雖解脫非一切脫，小脫於大仍名為縛，故云「未得此證」。	Next, below but leaving, it proves bondage and liberation. But leaving and so forth, leaving delusion in the small is called liberation, and using false names as bondage. Although liberated in the small, it is not liberation from everything. Liberation in the small is still called bondage in the great, therefore it says not yet attaining this realization.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0215c29_15']	大小俱有縛脫，唯今名脫。	大小俱有縛脫，唯今名脫。	Both the small and great have bondage and liberation, only now is it called liberation.

Below all buddhas, it correctly cites. It is necessary to explain each one, making the meaning correspond with the ten pairs, and harmonize with the meaning of this sūtra.

Because self-realization is true, it is said to be inconceivable. Because it follows the provisional for others, it is said to be language.

Since the fruition is accomplished through the ordinary, the meaning is also the same.

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0217a05_11']	以自通他無別法故，還以自十通利於他，是故文中但列十耳。	以自通他無別法故，還以自十通利於他，是故文中但列十耳。	Because there is no separate method in using one's own to penetrate others, one still uses one's own ten to penetrate and benefit others. Therefore, the text only lists ten.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0217a07_4']	或三十所以著「或言」者，表不定故，故自他一或無本數，指自他故。	或三十所以著「或言」者，表不定故，故自他一或無本數，指自他故。	As for thirty, the reason for using the word or is to show indefiniteness. Therefore, the one or of oneself and others has no original number, pointing to oneself and others.

Therefore, the one family's manifestation of the wonderful must preserve the five flavors in order to accomplish the wonderful.

If the four are grouped into two, each teaching has four as two. For example, in one's own, the provisional and real are grouped into one reality, and in others, the provisional and real are grouped into one provisional, thus forming only two.

In the beginning, the three baskets are considered others. Next, the two teachings are considered others. Finally, the three teachings are considered others, but in the end, the perfect is considered one's own.

The common has the uncommon, so it is the same as the distinct. The distinct is based on the meaning of the common, so it is the same as the Tripiṭaka.

Next, the original is gathered into the real, and the traces are gathered into the provisional. Then the coarse and wonderful in the traces are both coarse compared to the original, and the coarse and wonderful in the original are both wonderful compared to the traces.

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219b29_18']	初有背有向即世界，觀寂定生即為人，背生死惡即對治，寂滅有理即第一義。	初有背有向即世界，觀寂定生即為人，背生死惡即對治，寂滅有理即第一義。	First, having a back and having a direction is the world, contemplating quiescence and concentration is for the sake of people, turning away from the evil of birth and death is the antidote, and quiescence has principle is the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c03_3']	次約教中不淨觀成灼然初教，與空相應豈非通教，為分別故豈非別教，實相即是圓教意也。	次約教中不淨觀成灼然初教，與空相應豈非通教，為分別故豈非別教，實相即是圓教意也。	Next, in the teachings, the accomplishment of the contemplation of impurity is clearly the initial teaching, how could it not be the teaching of emptiness? It is for the sake of discrimination, how could it not be the separate teaching? The true aspect is the meaning of the perfect teaching.

['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c05_22']	「有身根九事，十事有餘根」。	「有身根九事，十事有餘根」。	The body faculty has nine substances, the remaining faculties have ten substances.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c07_13']	言九事者，即能造四大地水火風，及以所造色香味觸，并身根一，故云九事。	言九事者，即能造四大地水火風，及以所造色香味觸，并身根一，故云九事。	As for the nine substances, they are the four primary elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, as well as the four derivative forms of color, smell, taste, and touch, along with the body faculty, thus making nine substances.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c09_11']	言十事者，餘眼等根皆具十事，如眼根上有能造四及所造四，眼及身根故成十也。	言十事者，餘眼等根皆具十事，如眼根上有能造四及所造四，眼及身根故成十也。	As for the ten substances, the remaining eye faculties and so forth all have ten substances. For example, the eye faculty has the four primary elements and the four derivative forms, along with the eye and body faculties, thus making ten.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c10_1']	眼等覺觸即身根性。	眼等覺觸即身根性。	The eye faculty and the other faculties are of the nature of the body faculty.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c10_18']	「非三種化他」者，非三教中權實也。	「非三種化他」者，非三教中權實也。	Not the three kinds of transformations for others refers to the provisional and real in the three teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c13_16']	前已多重釋品，且約一種，以三屬化他為權，圓為自行屬實，故前文釋自他等三，約諦釋中作三節釋，第三節釋三俱屬化他。	前已多重釋品，且約一種，以三屬化他為權，圓為自行屬實，故前文釋自他等三，約諦釋中作三節釋，第三節釋三俱屬化他。	The chapter has already been explained many times, but for now, the three are considered provisional transformations for others, and the perfect teaching is considered real for one's own practice. Therefore, the previous text explains the three of self, other, etc., in terms of the four truths, and the third section explains the three as all belonging to transformations for others.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c14_17']	「深高橫度」者，於中法、譬、合，以此例後。	「深高橫度」者，於中法、譬、合，以此例後。	Deep, lofty, and horizontal crossing - in this, there is the principle, the analogy, and the combination. This is used as an example for what follows.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c16_10']	今釋實既周窮橫竪，下釋權理應深極，下當釋權預述其相，故注「云云」。	今釋實既周窮橫竪，下釋權理應深極，下當釋權預述其相，故注「云云」。	Now that the explanation of the real has been completely exhausted in terms of horizontal and vertical, the explanation of the provisional should correspond to the profound principle below, which will be explained below. Therefore, the commentary says and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c17_15']	「其智慧門」者，其乃指前實果因智，若智慧即門，門是權也。	「其智慧門」者，其乃指前實果因智，若智慧即門，門是權也。	As for the gate of wisdom, the refers to the previous fruition of the real and the wisdom of the cause, if wisdom is the gate, the gate is provisional.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c18_6']	若智慧之門，智即果也。	若智慧之門，智即果也。	If it is the gate of wisdom, wisdom is the fruition.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c20_4']	「蓋是」等者，此中須以十地為道前，妙覺為道中，證後為道後，故知文意在因之位。	「蓋是」等者，此中須以十地為道前，妙覺為道中，證後為道後，故知文意在因之位。	As for this is... and so on, here it is necessary to take the ten grounds as being before the path, wondrous enlightenment as being on the path, and the realization after as being after the path. Therefore, it is known that the meaning of the text is in the stage of the cause.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c21_13']	除真如外，凡有修入皆屬於權，唯以果位真如究滿，為清涼池。	除真如外，凡有修入皆屬於權，唯以果位真如究滿，為清涼池。	Except for true suchness, all that is cultivated and entered belongs to the provisional. Only the perfect completion of the true suchness of the fruition stage is the cool pond.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c22_15']	此約自行因果相望以釋，即釋品中第五重也。	此約自行因果相望以釋，即釋品中第五重也。	This explains from the perspective of the mutual comparison of the cause and effect of one's own practice, which is the fifth layer in the explanation of the chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c23_14']	若通餘九此則不然，豈以道前而無實耶？	若通餘九此則不然，豈以道前而無實耶？	If it is applied to the other nine, this is not so. How can it be that there is no reality before the path?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c24_4']	即初四雙中實也。	即初四雙中實也。	It is the reality within the first four pairs.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c24_13']	豈有道後而無權耶？	豈有道後而無權耶？	How could there be a path without skillful means?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c25_2']	即後五雙中權也。	即後五雙中權也。	It is the skillful means among the next five pairs.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c27_1']	「難解難入」等者，略歎道前因位始末，次從「不謀而了」去，即於因中仍指事用為權也。	「難解難入」等者，略歎道前因位始末，次從「不謀而了」去，即於因中仍指事用為權也。	Difficult to understand, difficult to enter and so on briefly praises the beginning and end of the causal stage before the path. Next, from accomplished without planning, it still points to the skillful means of function within the causes.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c28_10']	以此因權並是真因，即知此權由證實理，文中從用從因別歎。	以此因權並是真因，即知此權由證實理，文中從用從因別歎。	These causal skillful means are all true causes, so it is known that this skillful means is due to realizing the true principle. In the text, the function and causes are separately praised.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0219c29_11']	「十住始解」者，解是開之異名，故將名以對位。	「十住始解」者，解是開之異名，故將名以對位。	The ten abodes begin to understand - understanding is a different name for opening, so it is used to correspond with the stages.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a02_8']	《論》中此前更有三句，謂難見、難覺、難知，今謂此是難解方便，亦可以對聞思修三。	《論》中此前更有三句，謂難見、難覺、難知，今謂此是難解方便，亦可以對聞思修三。	In the treatise, there are three more sentences before this, namely difficult to see, difficult to realize, and difficult to know. Now it is said that this is the skillful means of difficulty in understanding, and it can also correspond to the three of hearing, thinking, and cultivation.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a05_15']	「法身本意」者，若望十方無時不應，今準此方未設化前，乃至久遠未結緣來，於此段眾生並名在法身，無有欲以小化之義，故云「擬之」。	「法身本意」者，若望十方無時不應，今準此方未設化前，乃至久遠未結緣來，於此段眾生並名在法身，無有欲以小化之義，故云「擬之」。	As for the original meaning of the Dharma body, if we look at it from the perspective of the ten directions, it is always appropriate. Now, based on this world, before the establishment of the teaching, and even from a long time ago before the formation of affinities, all beings in this period are called in the Dharma body. There is no meaning of wanting to transform them with the small, therefore it says intended for.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a06_15']	「無機」等者，此從結緣已後為言，其時猶寬。	「無機」等者，此從結緣已後為言，其時猶寬。	As for no capacity and so on, this is said from after the formation of affinities, and that time is still broad.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a07_7']	從「華嚴」下今世設化。	從「華嚴」下今世設化。	From Huayan below is the establishment of the teaching in this world.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a08_10']	「今大機」至「不知」者，大機擊於大應，故云「啟發」。	「今大機」至「不知」者，大機擊於大應，故云「啟發」。	As for the great capacity up to not knowing, the great capacity strikes the great response, therefore it says to initiate.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a08_20']	應言欲發，何以云啟？	應言欲發，何以云啟？	It should be said wanting to initiate, why does it say to initiate?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a09_9']	由大瑞已彰，故且云啟。	由大瑞已彰，故且云啟。	Because the great auspiciousness has already manifested, therefore it is provisionally called to initiate.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a11_15']	次重釋門中「光宅」等者，以五停等名小乘方便，若論化意散心彈指尚得是門，何獨小乘方便非門？	次重釋門中「光宅」等者，以五停等名小乘方便，若論化意散心彈指尚得是門，何獨小乘方便非門？	Next, in the section on the repeated explanation, Guangzhai and so on, the names such as the five cessations are the expedient means of the Small Vehicle. If we discuss the meaning of the transformation, even a distracted mind snapping one's fingers can still be the gate, how much more so are the expedient means of the Small Vehicle not the gate?
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a12_17']	光宅之意未必全然，不可全奪，故云「與奪」。	光宅之意未必全然，不可全奪，故云「與奪」。	The meaning of Guangzhai is not necessarily complete, and it cannot be completely denied, so it says give and take.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a14_2']	先明奪者未能入大，為佛所破，既不能知，門義不成。	先明奪者未能入大，為佛所破，既不能知，門義不成。	First, it clarifies the denial that one who has not yet entered the great is destroyed by the Buddha, and since one is unable to know, the meaning of the gate is not established.
['ZH_T34_1719_04a:0220a16_6']	所言與者，三教並是能通之門，二乘亦得能中少分，既未能入猶失於能，尚未成能永不識所。	所言與者，三教並是能通之門，二乘亦得能中少分，既未能入猶失於能，尚未成能永不識所。	As for what is given, the three teachings are all gates that can lead to the truth, and the two vehicles also obtain a small part of the ability.

One cannot replace this buddha with another buddha, nor can one explain the prediction of the disciples with the intention of different times. The intention of delight can explain the long-lasting traces and origins. Even if one uses it, one can only say that those who were not delighted before are just those who are suitable for the thought of extinction and the expedient means of the near.

How can profundity be only based on reality, and how can difficulty in understanding be only based on the provisional?

Because of one's own practice, both skillful means and reality are real; because of benefiting others, both skillful means and reality are skillful means.
