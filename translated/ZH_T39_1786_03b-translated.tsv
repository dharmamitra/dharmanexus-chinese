This Dharma-body includes the reward body and the response body as the above three virtues, and therefore it is said that by contemplating one, one sees the three Buddhas.

['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0117c08_16']	若不爾者，則信相本性與佛天殊，佛之應用非信相感也。	若不爾者，則信相本性與佛天殊，佛之應用非信相感也。	If it were not so, then the inherent nature of Faith and Understanding would be vastly different from the Buddha, and the Buddha's applications would not be the inspiration of Faith and Understanding.

The body has innumerable forms, the forms have innumerable characteristics, the characteristics have innumerable excellent qualities, and the abode and fruition also have innumerable kinds, with various adornments as they are manifested. They are boundless, inexhaustible, and free from limited characteristics. As appropriate, they are always able to abide and uphold without destruction or loss, all accomplished through the perfuming of the pāramitās and the inconceivable perfuming of the uncontaminated practices.

The response body is the present birth body, and the reward body is the present majestic and special body as well as the Dharma nature body.

['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c10_4']	若業識見，即無有邊、不可窮盡、離分齊相，名為尊特，屬於報身。	若業識見，即無有邊、不可窮盡、離分齊相，名為尊特，屬於報身。	If the seeing of karmic consciousness is boundless, inexhaustible, and free from limited characteristics, it is called the majestic and sublime body, which belongs to the reward body.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c12_11']	此如今經別所歎相在三十二，以金龍尊就佛四德微妙寂滅而為總讚，以總顯別，故三十二無非祕藏。	此如今經別所歎相在三十二，以金龍尊就佛四德微妙寂滅而為總讚，以總顯別，故三十二無非祕藏。	This is like the distinct praises in the present sutra, which are among the thirty-two. The Golden Dragon Venerable praises the Buddha's four virtues of subtlety and tranquility as a general praise, and uses the general to reveal the specific, so the thirty-two are all the secret treasury.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c13_11']	故一一相離於分齊，如空無邊、常住不毀。	故一一相離於分齊，如空無邊、常住不毀。	Therefore, each characteristic is free from limitations, like the boundless sky, eternally abiding and indestructible.

How can the thirty-two with a halo of one fathom be called the majestic and sublime body?
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c17_13']	言真中感應者，良以如來現應化身，示住徧真，說於生滅及無生法，被藏通機。	言真中感應者，良以如來現應化身，示住徧真，說於生滅及無生法，被藏通機。	As for the true and provisional感應, it is because the Tathagata manifests the transformation body, shows abiding in the universal truth, speaks of the arising and ceasing and the unborn Dharma, and is the device for the hidden and revealed teachings.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c18_17']	現尊特身，住於中道，宣說無量及無作法，被別圓機。	現尊特身，住於中道，宣說無量及無作法，被別圓機。	Manifesting the superior and special body, abiding in the middle way, proclaiming immeasurable and unconditioned dharmas, and being the object of the distinct and perfect capacities.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c19_12']	故《文句》云「丈六身佛住真諦」。	故《文句》云「丈六身佛住真諦」。	Therefore the Wenju says: The Buddha with the twelve-foot body abides in ultimate truth.

The Buddha with the superior and special body abides in both conventional truth and the middle way. The Buddha with the Dharma body abides in the middle way.

['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c23_14']	如《法華》歎佛，經文顯云「三十二相八十種好」，法身具故、嚴法身故，是尊特相。	如《法華》歎佛，經文顯云「三十二相八十種好」，法身具故、嚴法身故，是尊特相。	As for praising the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, the text clearly says the thirty-two marks and eighty minor marks, because the Dharma body is endowed with them and adorns the Dharma body, they are the marks of the superior and special body.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c24_14']	是故荊谿類同《華嚴》，一一相好與虛空等。	是故荊谿類同《華嚴》，一一相好與虛空等。	Therefore Jingxi classifies them as the same as the Huayan Sutra, with each mark and excellent quality being equal to empty space.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c25_11']	又云「一一相皆法界海，一一好無非名海。	又云「一一相皆法界海，一一好無非名海。	It also says: Each mark is the ocean of the Dharma realm, and each excellent quality is not apart from the ocean of names.

This is completely different from the ninety-seven names in the Huayan Sutra, and each one is the same as the thirty-two marks and eighty minor marks in the Fa jie ci di.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0123c29_13']	又〈懺悔品〉讚佛三十二相八十種好，豈龍尊昔讚與今金鼓所讚優劣？	又〈懺悔品〉讚佛三十二相八十種好，豈龍尊昔讚與今金鼓所讚優劣？	Moreover, the chapter on repentance praises the Buddha's thirty-two marks and eighty minor marks. How could the praise by the dragon king in the past be superior or inferior to the praise by the golden drum now?
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0124a02_3']	故知秖就中道感應稱為尊特，非是加添相好之數方名尊特。	故知秖就中道感應稱為尊特，非是加添相好之數方名尊特。	Therefore, it should be known that it is only called the superior response based on the middle way, not that the number of marks and minor marks added is called the superior response.
['ZH_T39_1786_03b:0124a03_14']	故《華嚴》中，業報眾生等十種之身皆盧舍那，舍那非報、報非尊特耶？	故《華嚴》中，業報眾生等十種之身皆盧舍那，舍那非報、報非尊特耶？	Therefore, in the Huayan Sutra, the ten kinds of bodies such as the karmic retribution of sentient beings are all Vairocana. Is Vairocana not retribution, and retribution not the superior response?
