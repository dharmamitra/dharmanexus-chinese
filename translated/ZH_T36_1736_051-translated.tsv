['ZH_T36_1736_051:0396c22_17']	一有無不二即一合相，以同如故；	一有無不二即一合相，以同如故；	First, existence and non-existence are not two, which is the single combined appearance, because they are the same as suchness;

They have already been cited in the first assembly. The differences in the five vehicles are only due to the differences in wisdom. Therefore, the wisdom of good observation is used to oppose the grasses and trees.
['ZH_T36_1736_051:0397a17_2']	疏「第二三願明果滿三德」者，能斷是般若，所斷是解脫，智周法界即法身取所證故。	疏「第二三願明果滿三德」者，能斷是般若，所斷是解脫，智周法界即法身取所證故。	As for the second three vows clarify the perfection of the three virtues of the fruit, the ability to cut is prajñā, and what is cut is liberation.

['ZH_T36_1736_051:0397b27_18']	一眾生性空，故無可滅。	一眾生性空，故無可滅。	First, the nature of sentient beings is empty, so there is no one to be liberated.
['ZH_T36_1736_051:0397b29_4']	二菩薩後得智同體悲，離自身外無別眾生，即無他體。	二菩薩後得智同體悲，離自身外無別眾生，即無他體。	Second, the subsequent wisdom and universal compassion of bodhisattvas are of the same essence. Apart from their own bodies, there are no separate sentient beings, so there is no other essence.

['ZH_T36_1736_051:0397c07_4']	眾生與佛同一法界，豈於此理度眾生哉？	眾生與佛同一法界，豈於此理度眾生哉？	Sentient beings and Buddhas are the same in the dharma realm. How can one liberate sentient beings based on this principle?
['ZH_T36_1736_051:0397c08_5']	故《淨名》云「眾聖賢亦如也，至於彌勒亦如也。	故《淨名》云「眾聖賢亦如也，至於彌勒亦如也。	Therefore, the Vimalakīrti Sūtra says, The multitude of sages and worthies are also thus, up to Maitreya is also thus.
['ZH_T36_1736_051:0397c09_4']	若彌勒得受記者，一切眾生亦應受記。	若彌勒得受記者，一切眾生亦應受記。	If Maitreya receives the prediction, then all sentient beings should also receive the prediction.
['ZH_T36_1736_051:0397c09_19']	」以同一如不應別故，斯理特深。	」以同一如不應別故，斯理特深。	Because of being the same suchness, they should not be separate. This principle is especially profound.

The meaning of the treatise is that the profound distinguishes worldly wisdom, and the subtle distinguishes the śrāvakas.
