['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a14_10']	身智盡竟，向前涅槃轉名無餘。	身智盡竟，向前涅槃轉名無餘。	When the body and wisdom are completely extinguished, the nirvāṇa that turns forward is called without remainder.
['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a15_13']	非身智滅即名涅槃，以身智起已謝滅是無常故。	非身智滅即名涅槃，以身智起已謝滅是無常故。	The extinction of the body and wisdom is not called nirvāṇa, because the arising and passing away of the body and wisdom is impermanent.
['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a16_14']	若斷因故令後不起，是非擇滅，故非涅槃。	若斷因故令後不起，是非擇滅，故非涅槃。	If it is called nirvāṇa because the causes are severed and future [births] do not arise, then it is a non-analytical cessation and therefore not nirvāṇa.

['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a19_15']	由有宗中要道親斷方稱擇滅，身口二業及生死果非道親斷，故不取之。	由有宗中要道親斷方稱擇滅，身口二業及生死果非道親斷，故不取之。	In the Sarvâstivāda, only that which is directly severed by the path is called an analytical cessation. The two karmas of body and speech and the fruits of birth and death are not directly severed by the path, and therefore they are not taken [as nirvāṇa].
['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a21_4']	《成實》由斷煩惱，餘不起故、見修斷故，亦得擇滅，故名涅槃。	《成實》由斷煩惱，餘不起故、見修斷故，亦得擇滅，故名涅槃。	According to the Satyasiddhi Śāstra, because one severs afflictions, the rest do not arise, and because they are severed by the path of insight and cultivation, one also attains an analytical cessation, and therefore it is called nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a22_1']	然望大乘，皆名有餘，有餘變易故。	然望大乘，皆名有餘，有餘變易故。	However, compared to the Mahāyāna, they are all called with remainder, because there is the remainder of the transformed and changeable [body].

['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a26_5']	三云分段因果及變易因盡名曰有餘，變易果滅名曰無餘；	三云分段因果及變易因盡名曰有餘，變易果滅名曰無餘；	Third, it is said that when the causes and effects of the segmented [realm] and the causes of the transformed [realm] are exhausted, it is called with remainder, and when the effects of the transformed [realm] cease, it is called without remainder;
['ZH_T36_1736_081:0633a27_7']	四者唯就變易因果為二，分段因果屬小乘故。	四者唯就變易因果為二，分段因果屬小乘故。	Fourth, it is said that only the causes and effects of the transformed [realm] are considered the two [types of nirvana]. The causes and effects of the segmented [realm] belong to the Hīnayāna.

Although there is still subtle suffering, the basis has not yet ceased, but the obstacles are eternally quiescent, so it is called nirvāṇa.

Due to this, one does not abide in either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, and benefits and delights sentient beings to the end of the future. Functioning while always quiescent is called nirvāṇa.
