['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c12_13']	以此八種因緣，知有阿羅耶識。	以此八種因緣，知有阿羅耶識。	001	Based on these eight kinds of reasons, we know there is an ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c13_8']	若離此識，根有執持，實無此理。	若離此識，根有執持，實無此理。	001	If apart from this consciousness, the faculties have grasping, this is not actually the case.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c13_13']	執持有五：	執持有五：	001	Grasping has five aspects:
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c15_12']	一者阿羅耶識持先世業，復從現因後諸識生，如佛阿毘曇說「因根塵心業諸識得生」。	一者阿羅耶識持先世業，復從現因後諸識生，如佛阿毘曇說「因根塵心業諸識得生」。	001	First, the ālaya consciousness holds the karma of past lives, and then the various consciousnesses arise from present causes, as the Buddha's Abhidharma says, The various consciousnesses arise due to the causes of faculties, objects, mind, and karma.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c16_3']	二者善不善等六識得生。	二者善不善等六識得生。	001	Second, the six consciousnesses such as good and bad are able to arise.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c17_11']	三者於六識中若有一無記識而獨是執所攝持者，無有是處。	三者於六識中若有一無記識而獨是執所攝持者，無有是處。	001	Third, if there is a single indeterminate consciousness among the six consciousnesses that is alone grasped and sustained, there is no such possibility.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c18_15']	四者諸識各依根生，隨生一識根有執持，餘根應無。	四者諸識各依根生，隨生一識根有執持，餘根應無。	001	Fourth, the various consciousnesses each arise based on their respective faculties. If one consciousness arises and its faculty grasps and sustains it, the other faculties should be without [this function].
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c19_8']	五者諸根數執持，義則不然。	五者諸根數執持，義則不然。	001	Fifth, it is unreasonable for the faculties to grasp and sustain in turn.

['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c21_4']	執持本者，從初諸識不得俱生，亦無是處。	執持本者，從初諸識不得俱生，亦無是處。	001	As for the original grasping and sustaining, it is impossible for the various consciousnesses to arise simultaneously from the beginning.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c21_9']	若人問言：	若人問言：	001	If someone asks:
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c21_20']	有阿羅耶識，諸識俱生？	有阿羅耶識，諸識俱生？	001	Does the ālaya consciousness arise simultaneously with the various consciousnesses?

['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c23_7']	有實義故、如阿含故。	有實義故、如阿含故。	001	Because there is a real meaning and because it accords with the scriptures.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c23_17']	二識俱生，何以知之？	二識俱生，何以知之？	001	How do we know that the two consciousnesses arise simultaneously?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c25_19']	如有一人欲得見聞，乃至於知諸識各各自根塵，心欲無異、根塵無異，一識得生，餘者何妨。	如有一人欲得見聞，乃至於知諸識各各自根塵，心欲無異、根塵無異，一識得生，餘者何妨。	001	It is like a single person who wishes to see, hear, and so on, up to cognize various objects. Each of the consciousnesses has its own faculties and objects. The mind's desires are no different, and the faculties and objects are no different. When one consciousness arises, what prevents the others from arising?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c26_8']	此為實義，阿含後說。	此為實義，阿含後說。	001	This is the true meaning, as explained in the later teachings of the Āgamas.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c27_1']	分明者，諸識不俱，取境不了。	分明者，諸識不俱，取境不了。	001	As for clear, the various consciousnesses do not arise simultaneously, and the grasping of objects is not clear.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c27_19']	若以心識與眼識等為伴取境，是則分明。	若以心識與眼識等為伴取境，是則分明。	001	If the mind consciousness and eye consciousness, etc. are companions in grasping objects, then it is clear.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c28_3']	何以故？	何以故？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1018c29_8']	曾行諸塵，然後追思，多不明了，識識不俱，意獨緣故。	曾行諸塵，然後追思，多不明了，識識不俱，意獨緣故。	001	Having previously experienced various objects, when one subsequently recollects them, they are often not clear, because the various consciousnesses do not arise simultaneously, and the mind alone is the support.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a01_7']	不如緣現則易明了，識識俱故，故知俱生。	不如緣現則易明了，識識俱故，故知俱生。	001	Unlike when experiencing the present, which is easily clear, because the various consciousnesses arise simultaneously. Therefore, we know they arise simultaneously.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a02_11']	種本者，若離阿羅耶識，眼等六識互為本者，則無是處。	種本者，若離阿羅耶識，眼等六識互為本者，則無是處。	001	As for the fundamental seeds, if the six consciousnesses such as the eye consciousness mutually serve as the fundamental seeds, apart from the ālaya consciousness, this is impossible.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a02_16']	云何知耶？	云何知耶？	001	How do we know this?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a04_4']	善識滅時不善心生，不善識滅善心復生，善不善滅無記心生；	善識滅時不善心生，不善識滅善心復生，善不善滅無記心生；	001	When a wholesome consciousness ceases, an unwholesome mind arises. When an unwholesome consciousness ceases, a wholesome mind arises again. When wholesome and unwholesome cease, an indeterminate mind arises;
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a05_12']	下界心滅中界識生，中界心滅上識即生，上識亦滅下心還生；	下界心滅中界識生，中界心滅上識即生，上識亦滅下心還生；	001	When the mind of the lower realm ceases, the consciousness of the middle realm arises. When the mind of the middle realm ceases, the upper consciousness immediately arises. When the upper consciousness also ceases, the lower mind arises again.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a06_11']	有漏識滅無漏心生，無漏心滅有漏還生。	有漏識滅無漏心生，無漏心滅有漏還生。	001	When the contaminated consciousness ceases, the uncontaminated mind arises. When the uncontaminated mind ceases, the contaminated one arises again.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a08_7']	故知六識不互為本，如次第心滅，於無數劫還更得生，故知阿羅耶識以為種本。	故知六識不互為本，如次第心滅，於無數劫還更得生，故知阿羅耶識以為種本。	001	Therefore, we know that the six consciousnesses do not mutually serve as the basis. Just as the mind ceases in sequence and can still arise again after countless eons, we know that the ālaya consciousness serves as the fundamental cause.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a09_2']	非是事者，諸識不俱則無此事。	非是事者，諸識不俱則無此事。	001	This is not the case for the other consciousnesses, because the consciousnesses do not occur simultaneously.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a09_6']	何以故？	何以故？	001	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a09_11']	此有四事：	此有四事：	001	This has four aspects:
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a09_16']	一者器事；	一者器事；	001	First, the aspect of the receptacle;
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a10_1']	二者捉身事；	二者捉身事；	001	Second, the aspect of grasping the body;
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a10_8']	三者言是我事；	三者言是我事；	001	Third, the aspect of thinking this is me;
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a10_14']	四者於塵事。	四者於塵事。	001	Fourth, the aspect of objects.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a11_3']	如此四事，念念俱生。	如此四事，念念俱生。	001	These four aspects arise simultaneously in every moment.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a12_2']	若言一識於一念中知四事者，無有是處。	若言一識於一念中知四事者，無有是處。	001	If it is said that a single consciousness knows these four aspects in a single moment, this is not possible.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a13_3']	言身受者，若離阿羅耶識有身受者，則無此義。	言身受者，若離阿羅耶識有身受者，則無此義。	001	As for bodily feeling, if there is bodily feeling apart from the ālaya consciousness, then this is not the case.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a13_8']	云何知耶？	云何知耶？	001	How do we know this?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a14_7']	猶如有人若實心作、不實心作，要先思惟。	猶如有人若實心作、不實心作，要先思惟。	001	It is like a person who, whether with a sincere or insincere mind, must first contemplate.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a15_15']	若定心、不定心諸受，於身種種多生諸受得生，故知有阿羅耶識。	若定心、不定心諸受，於身種種多生諸受得生，故知有阿羅耶識。	001	If the mind is determined or undetermined, various feelings arise in the body, and many feelings are produced. Therefore, we know there is an ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a16_6']	有無識定，亦無此義。	有無識定，亦無此義。	001	If there is no consciousness, this meaning does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a16_11']	何以知之？	何以知之？	001	How do we know this?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a17_12']	若入無想定、入無識定者，六識皆滅，此人應死。	若入無想定、入無識定者，六識皆滅，此人應死。	001	If one enters the concentration of non-perception or the concentration of no-thought, the six consciousnesses all cease, and this person should die.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a18_6']	如佛所說「入無心定而識不滅」。	如佛所說「入無心定而識不滅」。	001	As the Buddha said, Entering the concentration of no-thought, yet consciousness does not cease.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a19_8']	言非氣絕者，若離阿羅耶識有氣絕者，無有是處。	言非氣絕者，若離阿羅耶識有氣絕者，無有是處。	001	It is said that this is not like fainting. If apart from the ālaya consciousness there were fainting, there would be no such case.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a19_13']	云何知耶？	云何知耶？	001	How do we know this?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a21_2']	如善惡二人臨命終時，善人足冷煖上至頂，頂若冷時人命即滅；	如善惡二人臨命終時，善人足冷煖上至頂，頂若冷時人命即滅；	001	When two people, one good and one evil, are about to die, for the good person the cold reaches the top of the head from the feet, and when the head is cold the person's life ends;
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a22_2']	惡人死時從頂冷至足，煖氣滅時此人命終。	惡人死時從頂冷至足，煖氣滅時此人命終。	001	for the evil person, when dying, the cold starts from the head and reaches the feet. When the warm energy ceases, this person's life ends.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a22_16']	意識常在身，阿羅耶識持身故。	意識常在身，阿羅耶識持身故。	001	The mental consciousness is always in the body, because the ālaya consciousness holds the body.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a23_12']	阿羅耶識滅，而身即冷，便不覺觸。	阿羅耶識滅，而身即冷，便不覺觸。	001	When the ālaya consciousness ceases, the body immediately becomes cold and no longer feels touch.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a24_10']	此冷煖二事，不由意識，故知有阿羅耶識。	此冷煖二事，不由意識，故知有阿羅耶識。	001	These two things of cold and warmth are not due to the mental consciousness, therefore we know that there is an ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a25_3']	欝陀南：	欝陀南：	001	Udāna:
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a26_0']	境界相賴起，　　更互為因緣，	境界相賴起，　　更互為因緣，	001	The characteristics of objects arise in dependence on each other, mutually serving as causes and conditions,
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a27_13']	得共相應生，　　與煩惱俱滅。	得共相應生，　　與煩惱俱滅。	001	Able to arise in association, together with the afflictions ceasing.

['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019a29_11']	一種現有滅境界者，阿羅耶識因二境生：	一種現有滅境界者，阿羅耶識因二境生：	001	One kind is the present cessation of the existing object. The ālaya consciousness arises due to two objects:
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b01_1']	一者在內持事故；	一者在內持事故；	001	First, internally it holds the matter of the self;
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b01_17']	二者在外持器，不能分別諸相貌故。	二者在外持器，不能分別諸相貌故。	001	Second, externally it holds the receptacle world, but it is unable to discriminate various characteristics and appearances.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b03_7']	此內持者，執著邪我見習勢力，與根色俱時而執持者，即為境界。	此內持者，執著邪我見習勢力，與根色俱時而執持者，即為境界。	001	This internal holding is the power of the habit energy of the view of a false self, which simultaneously holds together with the sense faculties and form, and becomes the object.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b04_8']	此欲、色界有，無色界中唯有執著邪我見習勢力。	此欲、色界有，無色界中唯有執著邪我見習勢力。	001	This exists in the desire realm and form realm, but in the formless realm there is only the power of the habit energy of the view of a false self.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b05_17']	二者在外持器不分像貌者，在內為阿羅耶識所持，即持外界。	二者在外持器不分像貌者，在內為阿羅耶識所持，即持外界。	001	Second, the outer container does not distinguish appearances, but internally it is held by the ālaya consciousness, which holds the external world.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b06_10']	譬燈持炷油在於內而有外照；	譬燈持炷油在於內而有外照；	001	It is like a lamp holding a wick and oil inside while illuminating outside;
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b07_2']	阿羅耶識事內外亦爾。	阿羅耶識事內外亦爾。	001	The functions of the ālaya consciousness are also like this inside and outside.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b08_13']	此境界者甚深妙細，若以世中多聞智人，亦不能了此境是恒而有異。	此境界者甚深妙細，若以世中多聞智人，亦不能了此境是恒而有異。	001	This object is very profound and subtle. Even a person of much learning in the world cannot understand that this object is constant yet changing.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b08_18']	云何無異？	云何無異？	001	How is it unchanging?
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b13_13']	從初一念來被持境，乃至於死生一味事，阿羅耶識於境界中念念生滅，在欲界中取境微小，於色界中取境廣大，於無色界無量空處、無量識處取無量境，於無所有處取微細境，於非有想非無想取境甚深微妙。	從初一念來被持境，乃至於死生一味事，阿羅耶識於境界中念念生滅，在欲界中取境微小，於色界中取境廣大，於無色界無量空處、無量識處取無量境，於無所有處取微細境，於非有想非無想取境甚深微妙。	001	From the first moment until death, the object is held in a single flavor. The ālaya consciousness arises and ceases moment by moment within the object. In the desire realm, it takes a small object. In the form realm, it takes a vast object. In the formless realm, in the sphere of infinite space and the sphere of infinite consciousness, it takes immeasurable objects. In the sphere of nothingness, it takes a subtle object. In the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, it takes a very profound and subtle object.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b16_6']	此兩境故、微妙故、一味故、念念滅故、微小境故、廣大境故、無量境故、微細境故、甚深微妙境故，知有阿羅耶識事。	此兩境故、微妙故、一味故、念念滅故、微小境故、廣大境故、無量境故、微細境故、甚深微妙境故，知有阿羅耶識事。	001	Because of these two objects, subtlety, single flavor, momentariness, small objects, vast objects, immeasurable objects, subtle objects, and extremely profound and subtle objects, we know there is the matter of ālaya consciousness.
['ZH_T30_1584_001:1019b17_6']	相賴起者，阿羅耶識與五心數法相賴得生。	相賴起者，阿羅耶識與五心數法相賴得生。	001	As for arising in dependence on characteristics, ālaya consciousness arises in dependence on the five mental factors.
