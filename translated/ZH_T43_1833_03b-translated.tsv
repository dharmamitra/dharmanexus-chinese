['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877b28_11']	即當生果五蘊之因。	即當生果五蘊之因。	03b	It is the cause of the five aggregates of the future fruit.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877b29_9']	由今第八持當果因方有結生當果相續。	由今第八持當果因方有結生當果相續。	03b	Because the eighth consciousness now holds the cause of the future fruit, there is rebirth and the continuation of the future fruit.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c01_1']	故說第八名為執取。	故說第八名為執取。	03b	Therefore, the eighth consciousness is called grasping and clinging.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c02_3']	結生相續即取之執名為執取　二云由種子故。	結生相續即取之執名為執取　二云由種子故。	03b	Rebirth and continuation is the grasping of grasping, called grasping and clinging. Second, it is said that due to seeds,
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c02_16']	現行第八受一期生名為執取。	現行第八受一期生名為執取。	03b	The present eighth consciousness experiences a lifetime of birth, called grasping and clinging.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c03_7']	故世親攝論第一云。	故世親攝論第一云。	03b	Therefore, the first chapter of Vasubandhu's Mahāyānasaṃgrahabhāṣya says:
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c04_12']	由阿賴耶識中一期自體熏習位故彼體起故說名彼生。	由阿賴耶識中一期自體熏習位故彼體起故說名彼生。	03b	Because the state of perfuming of the body for a period of time in the ālaya consciousness is the cause of the arising of that body, it is said to be born from that body.🔽Because it experiences the birth of that body, it is said to grasp the birth of that body.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c05_11']	受彼生故名取彼生　三云取謂能取。	受彼生故名取彼生　三云取謂能取。	03b	The third explanation is that grasping is the ability to grasp.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c06_8']	由今現八執彼當生因果等種故。	由今現八執彼當生因果等種故。	03b	Because it now grasps the seeds of the causes and effects of that future birth.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c06_17']	故有結生當相續義。	故有結生當相續義。	03b	Therefore, there is the meaning of rebirth and subsequent continuity.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c07_7']	執即是取名為執取。	執即是取名為執取。	03b	Grasping is itself grasping, and is therefore called grasping.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c07_12']	故攝論云。	故攝論云。	03b	Therefore the Mahāyānasaṃgraha says:
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c08_10']	又於相續正結生時取彼生故執受自體。	又於相續正結生時取彼生故執受自體。	03b	Moreover, at the very moment of rebirth in a continuum, it grasps that birth and grasps the body.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c09_11']	是故此識名阿陀那　世親所釋如第二引。	是故此識名阿陀那　世親所釋如第二引。	03b	Therefore this consciousness is called ālaya. Vasubandhu's explanation is the same as the second citation.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c10_2']	經是一文義意通二。	經是一文義意通二。	03b	The sūtra is one text, but the meaning and intention are both included in the two.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c10_11']	第二三釋俱以為證。	第二三釋俱以為證。	03b	The second three explanations are all taken as evidence.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c11_7']	證意可悉　言結生時而有四釋。	證意可悉　言結生時而有四釋。	03b	The meaning of the evidence can be fully understood. The four explanations of the moment of rebirth are as follows.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c11_16', 'ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c12_11']	一云結生是潤生也。🔽若生無色命終之位名為結生。	一云結生是潤生也。 若生無色命終之位名為結生。	03b	The first says that rebirth is the stage of nourishing rebirth.🔽If one is born in the formless realm, the moment of death is called rebirth.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c13_7']	若生欲．色中有末心名為結生。	若生欲．色中有末心名為結生。	03b	If one is born in the desire or form realms, the last moment of the intermediate state of existence is called rebirth.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c13_12']	故攝論云。	故攝論云。	03b	Therefore the Mahāyānasaṃgraha says:
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c14_7']	依中有位起染意識結生相續。	依中有位起染意識結生相續。	03b	When the intermediate state of existence is relied upon, defiled mental consciousness arises and the continuity of rebirth is established.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c14_10']	又云。	又云。	03b	It also says:
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c15_12']	中有沒心名結生心　二云正受生時名為結生。	中有沒心名結生心　二云正受生時名為結生。	03b	The mind that perishes in the intermediate state is called the mind of rebirth.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c16_1']	故瑜伽第一云。	故瑜伽第一云。	03b	Therefore, the first chapter of the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says:🔽At this time, it is said that consciousness has already entered and established the continuity of rebirth. This is called the kalala stage.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c17_16']	於此時中說識已住結生相續即此名為羯邏藍位　三云合前二義名結生也。	於此時中說識已住結生相續即此名為羯邏藍位　三云合前二義名結生也。	03b	The third interpretation combines the previous two meanings and calls it rebirth.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c19_2']	𨷂一不可　四即命終心及中有末心俱名結生。	𨷂一不可　四即命終心及中有末心俱名結生。	03b	The first interpretation is untenable. The fourth interpretation calls both the mind at the end of death and the end of the intermediate state rebirth.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c19_7']	皆能潤故。	皆能潤故。	03b	Because both can moisten.

['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a16_14']	既許前後多識雖異而類是同。	既許前後多識雖異而類是同。	03b	Since it is allowed that the many consciousnesses of the past and future, although different, are the same in class,
