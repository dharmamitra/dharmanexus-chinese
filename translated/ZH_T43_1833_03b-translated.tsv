['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877b28_11']	即當生果五蘊之因。	即當生果五蘊之因。	It is the cause of the five aggregates of the future fruit.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877b29_9']	由今第八持當果因方有結生當果相續。	由今第八持當果因方有結生當果相續。	Because the eighth consciousness now holds the cause of the future fruit, there is rebirth and the continuation of the future fruit.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c01_1']	故說第八名為執取。	故說第八名為執取。	Therefore, the eighth consciousness is called grasping and clinging.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c02_3']	結生相續即取之執名為執取　二云由種子故。	結生相續即取之執名為執取　二云由種子故。	Rebirth and continuation is the grasping of grasping, called grasping and clinging. Second, it is said that due to seeds,
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c02_16']	現行第八受一期生名為執取。	現行第八受一期生名為執取。	The present eighth consciousness experiences a lifetime of birth, called grasping and clinging.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c03_7']	故世親攝論第一云。	故世親攝論第一云。	Therefore, the first chapter of Vasubandhu's Mahāyānasaṃgrahabhāṣya says:
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c04_12']	由阿賴耶識中一期自體熏習位故彼體起故說名彼生。	由阿賴耶識中一期自體熏習位故彼體起故說名彼生。	Because the state of perfuming of the body for a period of time in the ālaya consciousness is the cause of the arising of that body, it is said to be born from that body.🔽Because it experiences the birth of that body, it is said to grasp the birth of that body.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c05_11']	受彼生故名取彼生　三云取謂能取。	受彼生故名取彼生　三云取謂能取。	The third explanation is that grasping is the ability to grasp.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c06_8']	由今現八執彼當生因果等種故。	由今現八執彼當生因果等種故。	Because it now grasps the seeds of the causes and effects of that future birth.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c06_17']	故有結生當相續義。	故有結生當相續義。	Therefore, there is the meaning of rebirth and subsequent continuity.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c07_7']	執即是取名為執取。	執即是取名為執取。	Grasping is itself grasping, and is therefore called grasping.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c07_12']	故攝論云。	故攝論云。	Therefore the Mahāyānasaṃgraha says:
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c08_10']	又於相續正結生時取彼生故執受自體。	又於相續正結生時取彼生故執受自體。	Moreover, at the very moment of rebirth in a continuum, it grasps that birth and grasps the body.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c09_11']	是故此識名阿陀那　世親所釋如第二引。	是故此識名阿陀那　世親所釋如第二引。	Therefore this consciousness is called ālaya. Vasubandhu's explanation is the same as the second citation.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0877c10_2']	經是一文義意通二。	經是一文義意通二。	The sūtra is one text, but the meaning and intention are both included in the two.

['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a07_12']	故無性論第二云。	故無性論第二云。	Therefore the second chapter of the Satyākāravāda section of the Rnam par shes pa'i sde pa'i brjed byang (Vijñānavādin Smṛtyupasthāna) says:
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a08_3']	若言依止種類句義。	若言依止種類句義。	If it is said that the meaning of the class of phrases is based on

['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a09_6']	由異品故有相熏習。	由異品故有相熏習。	because of being of a different kind, there is perfuming.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a09_14']	非一切者　釋曰。	非一切者　釋曰。	Not all means not all.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a10_9']	前後識別能所熏異名為異品。	前後識別能所熏異名為異品。	The preceding and subsequent consciousnesses are different in terms of what is perfumed and what perfumes, and are called different classes.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a11_4']	又謂隣次前後相熏不說一切。	又謂隣次前後相熏不說一切。	Moreover, it is said that they perfume each other in immediate succession, not that all do so.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a12_12']	云非一切　問但識熏類何得云互　答假實能所形待名互。	云非一切　問但識熏類何得云互　答假實能所形待名互。	Why is it said that not all do so? It is asked: If only consciousness perfumes, how can it be said that they perfume each other? It is answered: The real and the provisional, what perfumes and what is perfumed, are called each other in relation to each other.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a13_4']	亦如世言父子相生。	亦如世言父子相生。	It is also like the worldly saying that father and son give birth to each other.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a14_3']	又類既一後識熏時亦得名為熏前念也。	又類既一後識熏時亦得名為熏前念也。	Moreover, since the class is the same, when the subsequent consciousness perfumes, it can also be called perfuming the preceding moment.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a15_10']	如前熏後識義意同也　或可彼許類．識相熏同此論說。	如前熏後識義意同也　或可彼許類．識相熏同此論說。	It is the same as the meaning of the preceding moment perfuming the subsequent moment. Or it may be that they allow the class and consciousness to perfume each other, the same as this treatise explains.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a16_1']	不爾云何名為互耶。	不爾云何名為互耶。	If it were not so, how could it be called each other?
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a16_14']	既許前後多識雖異而類是同。	既許前後多識雖異而類是同。	Since it is allowed that the many consciousnesses of the past and future, although different, are the same in class,
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a17_8']	故前熏後前凡後聖類同識異。	故前熏後前凡後聖類同識異。	Therefore, the preceding perfumes the subsequent. The preceding ordinary person and the subsequent noble one are the same in class but different in consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a18_10']	何不同彼前熏後耶　問若爾但可難自前後。	何不同彼前熏後耶　問若爾但可難自前後。	Why is it not the same as the preceding perfuming of the subsequent? It is asked: If so, it can only be difficult to understand the past and future of oneself.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a19_13']	如何難令異身相熏　答自識前後異類同得相熏。	如何難令異身相熏　答自識前後異類同得相熏。	How is it difficult to understand that the different bodies perfume each other? It is answered: The past and future of one's own consciousness, although different in class, can perfume each other.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a20_1']	他身類亦同。	他身類亦同。	The same is true for the class of other bodies.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a20_7']	故難更熏習。	故難更熏習。	Therefore, it is difficult to be perfumed again.
['ZH_T43_1833_03b:0881a20_13']	故無性論云。	故無性論云。	Therefore, the *Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi-śāstra says:
