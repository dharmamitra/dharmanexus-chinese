Only the universal taking of the five is called that which is cultivated here.
['ZH_T29_1562_061:0677c16_2']	彼居此中修四行相，總觀一切身受心法，所謂無常苦空無我。	彼居此中修四行相，總觀一切身受心法，所謂無常苦空無我。	They cultivate four aspects of contemplation while dwelling here, generally contemplating all bodies, feelings, thoughts, and dharmas, namely impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self.

['ZH_T29_1562_061:0677c21_16']	或有欲令先觀緣起，此後引起緣三義觀。	或有欲令先觀緣起，此後引起緣三義觀。	Some wish to have one first contemplate dependent origination, and then arouse the contemplation of the three meanings.

Because one becomes skilled in the seven kinds of wholesome states, one is able to establish the sequence of cause and effect in the previously seen objects and contemplate them.

['ZH_T29_1562_061:0677c28_8']	彼由聞慧於八諦中初起如斯十六行觀，如隔薄絹覩見眾色，齊此名為聞慧圓滿，思所成慧准此應說。	彼由聞慧於八諦中初起如斯十六行觀，如隔薄絹覩見眾色，齊此名為聞慧圓滿，思所成慧准此應說。	Through the wisdom of hearing, one first gives rise to this contemplation of the sixteen aspects within the eight truths, like seeing various colors through a thin silk cloth. This is called the perfection of the wisdom of hearing. The wisdom accomplished through thinking should be explained in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1562_061:0678a02_5']	次於生死深生厭患，欣樂涅槃寂靜功德，此後多引厭觀現前方便勤修漸增漸勝，引起如是能順決擇思所成攝最勝善根。	次於生死深生厭患，欣樂涅槃寂靜功德，此後多引厭觀現前方便勤修漸增漸勝，引起如是能順決擇思所成攝最勝善根。	Next, one deeply gives rise to disgust with birth and death, and delights in the tranquil virtues of nirvana. After this, one often induces the contemplation of disgust to manifest. Diligent cultivation gradually increases and becomes superior, giving rise to such supreme wholesome roots that accord with and are accomplished through thinking, which can lead to decisive understanding.

This is a distinction of the mindfulness of dharmas that generally takes the common characteristics as its object. It is the future cultivation that can burn the firewood of afflictions, the prior appearance of the fire of the holy path. Just as when drilling for fire, the initial appearance of heat arises. The dharma is the same as heat, so it is called the dharma of heat.

If one has previously separated from the defilements of the desire realm, then the wisdom that is cultivated and perfected, which is included in the form realm, is disgusted with samsara and delights in nirvana. The attention that is associated with much disgust can subsequently give rise to the good roots of heat.
['ZH_T29_1562_061:0678a20_1']	諸有先時未離欲染，依思所成慧引煖善根生，故彼不應作一向執。	諸有先時未離欲染，依思所成慧引煖善根生，故彼不應作一向執。	Those who have not previously separated from the defilements of the desire realm give rise to the good roots of heat by means of the wisdom that is perfected by thought. Therefore, one should not make a one-sided assertion.

Not all those who lack the dharma of heat are called those who violate.

They have already attained peace on the ancient sages' well-trodden path. If they diligently cultivate, they will certainly attain victory in this very life;
['ZH_T29_1562_061:0678b04_17']	以彼違越法毘柰耶，於諸勝利皆悉退失，下至煖法亦不能證。	以彼違越法毘柰耶，於諸勝利皆悉退失，下至煖法亦不能證。	because they violate the Dharma and Vinaya, they lose all the victories, and even the dharma of heat they are unable to realize.
['ZH_T29_1562_061:0678b06_15']	是故諸有遇佛出家，同此二人不能起煖，方名違越法毘柰耶，非諸無煖皆名違越。	是故諸有遇佛出家，同此二人不能起煖，方名違越法毘柰耶，非諸無煖皆名違越。	Therefore those who encounter the Buddha and leave the home-life, like these two people, are unable to generate heat, and are said to violate the Dharma and Vinaya. Those who do not have heat are not all said to violate.

In accordance with the Buddha's teachings on suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path, he gives rise to faith, and observes that all existence is constantly being burned by a raging fire.

The next good roots that arise, which are cultivated and accomplished, are called the dharma of the peak, which is a distinction of the mindfulness of dharmas that generally takes shared characteristics as objects.

The two movable ones are called heat and summit, because they are movable and of the highest degree.

This is because this stage is similar to the path of insight, because the path of insight is only the application of mindfulness to dharmas.

The weak and medium grades are the same as the summit of the class, that is, one is equipped with the contemplation of the realm of the four noble truths and is able to cultivate the sixteen aspects of the truths.

That is, the yogin contemplates the suffering of the realm of desire with four aspects and calls it one kind of mind. In this way, he next contemplates the suffering of the realms of form and of the formless, and he also contemplates the truths of origination, cessation, and the path in the same way, completing the contemplation of the eight kinds of mind, called the weak grade of patience.

This means that the practitioner contemplates the suffering of the desire realm with four aspects, up to fully contemplating the path of the desire realm with four aspects. In the higher realms, one reduces one aspect of the path. From this point on, it is called the beginning of the middle forbearance.

This is called the completion of the middle forbearance.
