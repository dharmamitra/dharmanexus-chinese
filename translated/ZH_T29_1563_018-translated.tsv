['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c07_17']	5 辯業品1辯業品第五之一此中一類隨順造惡，怯難論者作如是言：	5 辯業品1辯業品第五之一此中一類隨順造惡，怯難論者作如是言：	018	The proponents of the theory of fear and difficulty say:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c09_14']	如上所陳，諸內外事多種差別非業為因，現見世間果石等物眾多差別無異因故。	如上所陳，諸內外事多種差別非業為因，現見世間果石等物眾多差別無異因故。	018	The various internal and external things mentioned above are not caused by karma, because it is seen in the world that many different fruits such as stones and so forth are produced without a different cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c10_14']	謂從一種有多果生，無種為先有石等異。	謂從一種有多果生，無種為先有石等異。	018	That is to say, from one kind, many fruits are produced, and without seeds as a prior condition, there are differences such as stones.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c11_4']	為對彼執，故立宗言。	為對彼執，故立宗言。	018	In order to counter that view, the thesis is established.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c11_7']	頌曰：	頌曰：	018	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c12_0']	世別由業生，　　思及思所作，	世別由業生，　　思及思所作，	018	The differences in the world arise from karma, which is volition and what is produced by volition.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c13_13']	思即是意業，　　所作謂身語。	思即是意業，　　所作謂身語。	018	Volition is precisely mental karma, and what is produced refers to bodily and verbal [karma].
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c14_2']	論曰：	論曰：	018	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c15_1']	定由有情淨不淨業，諸內外事種種不同。	定由有情淨不淨業，諸內外事種種不同。	018	It is definitely due to the pure and impure karma of sentient beings that the various internal and external things have different characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c15_6']	云何知然？	云何知然？	018	How do we know this?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c15_11']	見業用故。	見業用故。	018	Because we see the function of karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c16_8']	謂世現見愛非愛果，差別生時定由業用。	謂世現見愛非愛果，差別生時定由業用。	018	That is to say, the world presently sees that when the differences in desirable and undesirable fruits are produced, it is definitely due to the function of karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c17_7']	如農夫類由勤正業，有稼穡等可愛果生；	如農夫類由勤正業，有稼穡等可愛果生；	018	It is like the case of farmers who, by their correct work, produce such desirable fruits as grain.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c18_6']	有諸愚夫行盜等業，便招非愛殺縛等果。	有諸愚夫行盜等業，便招非愛殺縛等果。	018	There are also fools who, by such actions as stealing, invite undesirable fruits such as being killed or bound.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c19_5']	復見亦有從初處胎，不由現因有樂有苦；	復見亦有從初處胎，不由現因有樂有苦；	018	We also see that from the first moment of the new existence in the womb, there is pleasure or pain without a present cause.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c20_13']	既見現在要業為先，方能引得愛非愛果，知前樂苦必業為先。	既見現在要業為先，方能引得愛非愛果，知前樂苦必業為先。	018	Since we see that in the present life, desirable or undesirable fruits are attracted only by means of previous action, we know that the previous pleasure or pain must have been due to action.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c21_11']	故非無因，諸內外事自然而有種種差別。	故非無因，諸內外事自然而有種種差別。	018	Therefore, internal and external things do not exist naturally, without causes, and the various distinctions are due to action.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c22_2']	別所由業，其體是何？	別所由業，其體是何？	018	What is the substance of this action that is the cause of distinctions?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c22_11']	謂心所思及思所作。	謂心所思及思所作。	018	It is volition and what is produced by volition.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c22_16']	故契經說：	故契經說：	018	A scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c23_11']	有二種業，一者思業、二思已業。	有二種業，一者思業、二思已業。	018	There are two kinds of action: first, the action of volition; second, the action that is the result of volition.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c24_10']	思已業者，謂思所作，即是由思所等起義。	思已業者，謂思所作，即是由思所等起義。	018	The action that is the result of volition is what is produced by volition, that is, what is produced by volition.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c25_8']	應知思者即是意業，思所作者即身語業。	應知思者即是意業，思所作者即身語業。	018	You must understand that volition is mental action, and what is produced by volition is bodily and vocal action.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c26_12']	如是二業於契經中，世尊說為三，謂身、語、意業。	如是二業於契經中，世尊說為三，謂身、語、意業。	018	The World-Honored One has explained these two kinds of karma in the sutras as three: bodily karma, verbal karma, and mental karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c27_12']	如是三業隨其次第，由所依自性等起故建立。	如是三業隨其次第，由所依自性等起故建立。	018	These three karmas are established according to their basis, intrinsic nature, and origination, in that order.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c28_7']	此中已說意業自性，謂即是思。	此中已說意業自性，謂即是思。	018	Among them, the intrinsic nature of mental karma has already been explained, namely, it is volition.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c28_12']	思如前辯。	思如前辯。	018	Volition has been discussed above.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c29_1']	身語二業自性云何？	身語二業自性云何？	018	What is the intrinsic nature of bodily and verbal karma?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0859c29_4']	頌曰：	頌曰：	018	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a01_13']	此身語二業，　　俱表無表性。	此身語二業，　　俱表無表性。	018	These bodily and verbal karmas are both indicative and non-indicative in nature.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a02_2']	論曰：	論曰：	018	Treatise:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a03_3']	應知如是所說諸業中，身語二業俱表無表性。	應知如是所說諸業中，身語二業俱表無表性。	018	It should be known that among the various karmas explained above, bodily and verbal karmas are both indicative and non-indicative in nature.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a03_8']	故本論言：	故本論言：	018	Therefore the Abhidharma treatise states:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a03_13']	云何身業：	云何身業：	018	What is bodily karma?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a04_2']	謂身所有表及無表。	謂身所有表及無表。	018	It refers to the indication and non-indication of the body.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a04_7']	云何語業？	云何語業？	018	What is verbal karma?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a04_16']	謂語所有表及無表。	謂語所有表及無表。	018	It refers to the indication and non-indication of speech.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a05_15']	復有何緣，唯身語業表無表性，意業不然？	復有何緣，唯身語業表無表性，意業不然？	018	What is the reason that only bodily and verbal karmas are indicative and non-indicative in nature, while mental karma is not?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a06_5']	以意業中無彼相故。	以意業中無彼相故。	018	Because mental karma lacks those characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a07_13']	謂能表示故名為表，表示自心令他知故，思無是事故不名表。	謂能表示故名為表，表示自心令他知故，思無是事故不名表。	018	Because it is able to indicate, it is called indication. It indicates one's own mind, causing others to know. Volition does not do this, so it is not called indication.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a09_6']	由此但言，身語二業能表非意，意無表故無表亦無，以無表名遮相似故。	由此但言，身語二業能表非意，意無表故無表亦無，以無表名遮相似故。	018	For this reason, it is only said that bodily and verbal actions are able to indicate, not the mind. Because the mind is without indication, there is also no non-indication. Because the term non-indication excludes what is similar.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a10_1']	是表種類，然不能表立無表名。	是表種類，然不能表立無表名。	018	This is a type of indication, but it is not able to indicate, so it is given the name non-indication.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a10_21']	《順正理》中別釋無理，謂無相續所依心故。	《順正理》中別釋無理，謂無相續所依心故。	018	In the Correct Explanation of the Principles, there is no reason for a separate explanation, saying that because there is no mind that is the support of a continuum.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a11_8']	為身語動是表業耶？	為身語動是表業耶？	018	Is the movement of the body and speech the indicated action?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a11_11']	不爾。	不爾。	018	No, it is not so.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a11_14']	云何？	云何？	018	How is it?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a11_17']	頌曰：	頌曰：	018	The verse says:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a12_0']	身表許別形，　　非行有為法，	身表許別形，　　非行有為法，	018	Bodily indication is considered to be a particular shape, not a composite or conditioned dharma.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a13_0']	有剎那盡故，　　應無無因故，	有剎那盡故，　　應無無因故，	018	Because it perishes in a moment, there should be no cause,
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a14_0']	生因應滅故，　　無決定因故，	生因應滅故，　　無決定因故，	018	because the cause of arising should be destroyed, there is no definite cause,
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a15_0']	地等無異故，　　了相有別故，	地等無異故，　　了相有別故，	018	because earth, etc. are not different, because the characteristics are different,
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a16_0']	取不待餘故，　　相違因別故，	取不待餘故，　　相違因別故，	018	because grasping does not depend on others, because the causes of opposition are different,
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a17_0']	有滅不滅故，　　許別有微故，	有滅不滅故，　　許別有微故，	018	Because there is both cessation and non-cessation, because it is admitted that there are subtle particles,
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a18_13']	非二根取故，　　彼定意境故。	非二根取故，　　彼定意境故。	018	Because it is not grasped by the two sense faculties, because it is the object of concentration and intention.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a19_0']	分別堅等已，　　長等智方生，	分別堅等已，　　長等智方生，	018	After distinguishing solidity, etc., the cognition of length, etc. arises.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a20_13']	一面觸多生，　　比知有長等。	一面觸多生，　　比知有長等。	018	Many arise from touching one side, inferring that there is length, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a21_0']	於多觸聚中，　　定有長等故，	於多觸聚中，　　定有長等故，	018	Because there is definitely length, etc. in a mass of many contacts,
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a22_13']	同故過同故，　　語表許言聲。	同故過同故，　　語表許言聲。	018	Because of similarity, because of the same error, verbal expression is admitted to be the sound of speech.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a23_2']	論曰：	論曰：	018	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a24_18']	髮毛等聚總名為身，於此身中有心所起四大種果形色差別，能表示心名為身表。	髮毛等聚總名為身，於此身中有心所起四大種果形色差別，能表示心名為身表。	018	The aggregate of hair, fur, etc. is collectively called the body. In this body, there is a difference in shape and color that is the effect of the four great elements produced by the mind, which can express the mind and is called bodily expression.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a25_18']	如思自體，雖剎那滅而立意業，於理無違。	如思自體，雖剎那滅而立意業，於理無違。	018	Just as the essence of volition, although momentary and ceasing, is established as mental action, there is no contradiction in principle.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a27_17']	如是身形立為身業，不立顯色及大種等為身表者，表通三性，此等皆唯，無記性故。	如是身形立為身業，不立顯色及大種等為身表者，表通三性，此等皆唯，無記性故。	018	In this way, the bodily form is established as bodily action. The manifest color and the great elements, etc. are not established as bodily expression, because expression is common to the three natures, while these are all only indeterminate natures.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860a29_10']	又顯色等不隨作者欲樂生故，又設離心亦得生故，表必待心方得生故。	又顯色等不隨作者欲樂生故，又設離心亦得生故，表必待心方得生故。	018	Also, because form, etc., do not arise according to the desires of the agent, and also because they can arise even apart from mind, while expression necessarily arises only in dependence on mind.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b02_9']	若大種等一心所生，如體有差別，法亦應爾故，然不可謂一心所生有差別體成差別性。	若大種等一心所生，如體有差別，法亦應爾故，然不可謂一心所生有差別體成差別性。	018	If the great elements, etc., are produced by a single mind, then just as their substance is different, so too should their dharmas be. However, it is not possible to say that what is produced by a single mind has a different substance and becomes a different nature.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b03_4']	復云何知身語二業有善不善？	復云何知身語二業有善不善？	018	How do we know that bodily and verbal karma can be wholesome or unwholesome?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b03_9']	契經說故。	契經說故。	018	Because it is said in the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b03_14']	如契經言：	如契經言：	018	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b05_6']	諸有染污眼耳所識法，彼具壽為非諸有清淨眼耳所識法，說亦如是。	諸有染污眼耳所識法，彼具壽為非諸有清淨眼耳所識法，說亦如是。	018	The defiled dharmas cognized by the eye and ear, are they not the pure dharmas cognized by the eye and ear of the long-lived ones? It is said to be the same.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b05_19']	復云何知四大種等唯無記性？	復云何知四大種等唯無記性？	018	How do we know that the great elements, etc., are only indeterminate?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b06_4']	亦由經說。	亦由經說。	018	Also because it is said in the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b06_9']	如契經言：	如契經言：	018	As a scripture says:
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b07_4']	或有一類身住十年，乃至廣說。	或有一類身住十年，乃至廣說。	018	There may be a type of person who dwells in the body for ten years, and so on at length.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b08_3']	說心意識異滅異生，故大種等唯無記性。	說心意識異滅異生，故大種等唯無記性。	018	It is said that mind, thought, and cognition are different in cessation and different in arising, therefore the great elements, etc., are only indeterminate.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b09_10']	雖諸行法因果無間異方生時，約世俗說名為行動亦名表業。	雖諸行法因果無間異方生時，約世俗說名為行動亦名表業。	018	Although the cause and effect of conditioned dharmas arise in different places without interval, it is conventionally said that there is movement and that this is bodily manifest karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b10_19']	而身表業必是勝義，非一切行實有行動，以有為法有剎那故。	而身表業必是勝義，非一切行實有行動，以有為法有剎那故。	018	But bodily manifest karma must be ultimate, not all conditioned dharmas that really move, because conditioned dharmas have moments.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b12_7']	非諸行體轉至餘方乃有滅義，以有為法是處纔生即還謝滅。	非諸行體轉至餘方乃有滅義，以有為法是處纔生即還謝滅。	018	The substance of conditioned dharmas does not move to another place and then perish, because conditioned dharmas are born in a place and then perish there.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b12_12']	剎那何謂？	剎那何謂？	018	What is a moment?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b13_6']	謂極少時，此更無容前後分析。	謂極少時，此更無容前後分析。	018	It is the shortest time, which cannot be further divided into an earlier and a later part.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b13_11']	時復何謂？	時復何謂？	018	What is time?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b14_14']	謂有過去未來現在分位不同，由此數知諸行差別。	謂有過去未來現在分位不同，由此數知諸行差別。	018	It is the different states of the past, future, and present, and it is by means of it that we know the differences among conditioned dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b15_8']	於中極少諸行分位名為剎那。	於中極少諸行分位名為剎那。	018	The shortest state of conditioned dharmas is called a moment.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b16_3']	故如是說，時之極促故名剎那。	故如是說，時之極促故名剎那。	018	Therefore it is said that the shortest time is called a moment.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b18_3']	此中剎那但取諸法有作用位，謂唯現在，即現在法有住分量名有剎那，如有月子。	此中剎那但取諸法有作用位，謂唯現在，即現在法有住分量名有剎那，如有月子。	018	Here, a moment is taken as the state in which dharmas have activity, that is, the present. Present dharmas have a duration and are therefore said to have moments, just as the moon has a crescent phase.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b20_1']	或能滅壞故名剎那，是能為因滅諸法義，謂無常相能滅諸法，此俱行法名有剎那。	或能滅壞故名剎那，是能為因滅諸法義，謂無常相能滅諸法，此俱行法名有剎那。	018	Or, because they are able to destroy, they are called momentary. This means that the characteristic of impermanence is able to destroy dharmas, and the dharmas that accompany it are called momentary.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b20_18']	復如何知諸有為法皆剎那滅必不久住？	復如何知諸有為法皆剎那滅必不久住？	018	How do we know that all conditioned dharmas are momentary and do not remain long?
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b21_17']	以諸有為後必盡故，現有滅法有待客因。	以諸有為後必盡故，現有滅法有待客因。	018	Because conditioned dharmas must eventually be exhausted. The present dharmas that are subject to cessation depend on adventitious causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b22_11']	既不待客因，纔生已即滅。	既不待客因，纔生已即滅。	018	Since they do not depend on adventitious causes, they cease as soon as they arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b23_10']	若初不滅，後亦應然，以後與初主因等故。	若初不滅，後亦應然，以後與初主因等故。	018	If they did not cease at the beginning, they would not cease later, because the later [moments] are the same as the primary cause at the beginning.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b24_2']	既見後有盡，知前念念滅。	既見後有盡，知前念念滅。	018	Since we see that later [moments] are exhausted, we know that the previous [moments] cease moment by moment.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b25_20']	若謂不然，世現見故，謂世現見薪等先有，由後與火客因合時，便致滅無，不復見故。	若謂不然，世現見故，謂世現見薪等先有，由後與火客因合時，便致滅無，不復見故。	018	If you say this is not so, because it is seen in the world, you say that the world is seen as follows: fuel, etc. exist first, and later, when they combine with fire, an adventitious cause, they are destroyed and no longer seen.
['ZH_T29_1563_018:0860b27_1']	定無餘量過現量者，故非諸法滅，皆不待客因。	定無餘量過現量者，故非諸法滅，皆不待客因。	018	There is definitely no other means of knowledge that surpasses direct perception, therefore the destruction of dharmas does not all depend on adventitious causes.

There is also no error of two forms of manifest form simultaneously arising in a single set of primary elements, because the bodily expression has a separate, equal flow of primary elements that are newly generated as its support.
