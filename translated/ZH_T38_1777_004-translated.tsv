['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b13_0']	第四、約圓教明位，釋淨、無垢、稱義者，此教詮	第四、約圓教明位，釋淨、無垢、稱義者，此教詮	004	Fourth, explaining the meaning of pure, stainless, and equal in terms of the perfect teaching. This teaching explains
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b15_8']	因緣即一實諦、不思議解脫、虛空佛性、大般涅槃、諸佛法界之理。	因緣即一實諦、不思議解脫、虛空佛性、大般涅槃、諸佛法界之理。	004	the principle of dependent origination as the one true reality, inconceivable liberation, the Buddha-nature of empty space, great parinirvāṇa, and the Dharma realm of all buddhas.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b16_13']	若菩薩稟此教門，理雖非深非淺，而證者不無深淺之位。	若菩薩稟此教門，理雖非深非淺，而證者不無深淺之位。	004	If bodhisattvas receive this teaching, although the principle is neither profound nor shallow, there are still profound and shallow stages in their realization.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b18_3']	今明此教入道，亦具有四門，而諸大乘經多用「非空非有門」也。	今明此教入道，亦具有四門，而諸大乘經多用「非空非有門」也。	004	Now, explaining the entry into the path in this teaching, it also has four approaches, and the various Mahāyāna sūtras often use the approach of neither empty nor existent.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b20_10']	正如此經諸菩薩各說「入不二法門」，一往雖同，細檢不無四門之別，而多用「非空非有門」入不思議解脫也。	正如此經諸菩薩各說「入不二法門」，一往雖同，細檢不無四門之別，而多用「非空非有門」入不思議解脫也。	004	Just like in this sūtra, the various bodhisattvas each explain the gate of entering the non-dual Dharma. Although they seem the same at first, upon closer examination there are distinctions between the four approaches, and they often use the approach of neither empty nor existent to enter inconceivable liberation.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b21_6']	此義在下，自當可見，就此略為三意：	此義在下，自當可見，就此略為三意：	004	This meaning will be evident later on, and here it is briefly explained in three points:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b21_19']	一，簡別、圓兩教明位不同；	一，簡別、圓兩教明位不同；	004	First, distinguishing the different ways of explaining stages in the Distinct and Perfect Teachings;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b22_6']	二，正明此教辨位；	二，正明此教辨位；	004	Second, correctly explaining the stages in this teaching;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b22_22']	三，約圓教位，釋淨、無、垢稱義。	三，約圓教位，釋淨、無、垢稱義。	004	Third, using the stages of the Perfect Teaching to explain the meaning of Pure, Unstained, and Renowned.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b24_18']	第一、簡別圓兩教明位不同者，圓教既詮圓理，略明圓義有八，異於八別，已如前說；	第一、簡別圓兩教明位不同者，圓教既詮圓理，略明圓義有八，異於八別，已如前說；	004	First, distinguishing the different ways of explaining stages in the Distinct and Perfect Teachings: Since the Perfect Teaching explains the perfect truth, it briefly explains the perfect meaning in eight ways, which are different from the eight distinctions, as explained above;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b25_12']	今但約斷無明、判位高下不同也。	今但約斷無明、判位高下不同也。	004	Now, it only discusses the differences in the high and low stages based on severing ignorance.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b28_1']	若別教明，三十心斷界內結，即伏界外無明，至迴向後心，發真智，見佛性中道之理，斷一品無明，名登初地；	若別教明，三十心斷界內結，即伏界外無明，至迴向後心，發真智，見佛性中道之理，斷一品無明，名登初地；	004	If the Distinct Teaching is explained, the thirty minds sever the bonds within the realms, and subdue the ignorance outside the realms. When the mind of the later stage of turning the will towards enlightenment arises, one realizes the truth of the middle way of the Buddha-nature, and severs one level of ignorance, called ascending to the first ground;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b28_14']	乃至斷十品無明，名為十地；	乃至斷十品無明，名為十地；	004	Up to severing ten levels of ignorance, called the ten grounds;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b29_4']	等覺後心，斷無明方盡；	等覺後心，斷無明方盡；	004	After the mind of the stage of enlightenment, the ignorance is completely severed;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540b29_17']	妙覺蕭然累外，此如前分別。	妙覺蕭然累外，此如前分別。	004	The wondrous enlightenment is aloof from the outside world, as explained above.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c02_19']	若圓教所明，從初假名發心即一心三觀，修隨喜心，入十信位，斷界內惑盡，即伏界外無明；	若圓教所明，從初假名發心即一心三觀，修隨喜心，入十信位，斷界內惑盡，即伏界外無明；	004	If it is explained according to the perfect teaching, from the initial stage of generating the mind of the provisional name, one immediately cultivates the three contemplations in one mind, enters the stage of the ten faiths by cultivating the mind of rejoicing, and exhausts the afflictions within the realm of desire, thereby subduing the ignorance outside the realm of desire;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c03_15']	十住初心，發圓真智慧，斷無明初品；	十住初心，發圓真智慧，斷無明初品；	004	In the initial stage of the ten abodes, one generates the perfect true wisdom and severs the first stage of ignorance;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c04_14']	從此四十心，皆斷無明，至等覺後心方盡；	從此四十心，皆斷無明，至等覺後心方盡；	004	From here, the forty stages all sever ignorance, and only at the final stage of the stage of equal enlightenment is it exhausted;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c05_15']	妙覺極地，蕭然累外，名究竟菩提無上大涅槃也。	妙覺極地，蕭然累外，名究竟菩提無上大涅槃也。	004	In the ultimate stage of wondrous enlightenment, one is completely free from the entanglements of the world, and it is called the ultimate enlightenment and the unsurpassed great nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c06_19']	此則判位，高下殊別，故有別、圓兩教明位不同也。	此則判位，高下殊別，故有別、圓兩教明位不同也。	004	This then distinguishes the high and low stages, and thus there are the two teachings of the distinct and perfect teachings that explain the stages differently.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c08_1']	第二、正明圓教位者，亦還約七位，明五十二位不同：	第二、正明圓教位者，亦還約七位，明五十二位不同：	004	Second, correctly explaining the stages of the perfect teaching also still uses the seven stages to explain the fifty-two stages differently:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c08_6']	一，十信；	一，十信；	004	1. The ten faiths;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c08_11']	二，十住；	二，十住；	004	2. The ten abodes;

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c09_13']	七，妙覺地。	七，妙覺地。	004	7. The stage of wondrous enlightenment.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c10_19']	但解者不同，有師言「圓教頓悟，一悟即是佛，無復位別之殊。	但解者不同，有師言「圓教頓悟，一悟即是佛，無復位別之殊。	004	However, the understandings differ. Some teachers say that in the perfect teaching, sudden enlightenment means that upon one enlightenment, one becomes a buddha, and there are no distinctions in stages.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c11_10']	說十地位者，為鈍根人耳。	說十地位者，為鈍根人耳。	004	The explanation of the ten stages is only for those with dull faculties.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c13_14']	如《思益經》云『如此學者，即不從一地至一地』」，又有師解言「圓教既是頓悟，初心一悟，即究竟圓極。	如《思益經》云『如此學者，即不從一地至一地』」，又有師解言「圓教既是頓悟，初心一悟，即究竟圓極。	004	As the Sutra of the Meaning of Thought says, Those who study in this way do not go from one stage to another stage. There are also teachers who explain that since the perfect teaching is sudden enlightenment, upon the initial enlightenment, it is ultimately perfect and complete.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c14_16']	而有四十二位者，但是化物方便，立淺深之名耳。	而有四十二位者，但是化物方便，立淺深之名耳。	004	But there are forty-two stages, this is just a skillful means to transform beings, establishing names of shallow and deep.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c15_15']	故《楞伽經》云『初地即二地，二地即三地。	故《楞伽經》云『初地即二地，二地即三地。	004	Therefore, the Sutra of the Lankavatara says, The first stage is the second stage, and the second stage is the third stage.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c17_1']	』寂滅真如，有何次也」，又有師言「圓教頓悟，至十住即是十地；	』寂滅真如，有何次也」，又有師言「圓教頓悟，至十住即是十地；	004	In the true suchness of quiescence, how can there be sequence? There are also teachers who say that in the perfect teaching, sudden enlightenment means that upon reaching the ten abodes, one is already at the ten stages;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c18_10']	而說有十行、十迴向、十地者，此是重說」，意謂此諸解釋，悉是偏取。	而說有十行、十迴向、十地者，此是重說」，意謂此諸解釋，悉是偏取。	004	But it explains that there are ten practices, ten dedications, and ten stages, this is a repetition. The meaning is that all these explanations are biased.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c19_11']	但平等法界，尚不論悟與不悟，孰論淺之與深？	但平等法界，尚不論悟與不悟，孰論淺之與深？	004	But in the realm of the Dharma-realm of equality, there is no discussion of enlightenment or non-enlightenment, let alone shallow or deep.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c20_7']	不悟而論悟者，不淺不深論淺深也。	不悟而論悟者，不淺不深論淺深也。	004	To discuss enlightenment without enlightenment is to discuss shallow and deep without shallow and deep.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c22_14']	尋諸大乘經明理究竟，無過《華嚴》、《大集》、《大品》、《法華》、《涅槃》明法界平等，無說無示，而菩薩位行，終自炳然。	尋諸大乘經明理究竟，無過《華嚴》、《大集》、《大品》、《法華》、《涅槃》明法界平等，無說無示，而菩薩位行，終自炳然。	004	Examining the ultimate principles in the Mahayana sutras, none surpass the Huayan, the Great Collection, the Great Perfection of Wisdom, the Lotus Sutra, and the Nirvana Sutra in clarifying the equality of the Dharma-realm, which is beyond words and explanations, yet the stages and practices of the bodhisattvas are still clearly revealed.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c23_12']	是以今還約七位，以明圓教菩薩之位也。	是以今還約七位，以明圓教菩薩之位也。	004	Therefore, I will now discuss the stages of the bodhisattvas of the perfect teaching based on the seven stages.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c25_4']	一、十信者，若利根頓悟，深妙善根，聞說「一切眾生即大涅槃，不可復滅；	一、十信者，若利根頓悟，深妙善根，聞說「一切眾生即大涅槃，不可復滅；	004	First, the ten faiths: If one has sharp faculties, suddenly awakens, and has profound and wonderful wholesome roots, hearing the teaching that all sentient beings are the great nirvana, which cannot be extinguished again;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c27_3']	一切眾生悉菩提相」，即發大慈大悲，緣無作四實諦，起四弘誓願，是名圓教發菩提心。	一切眾生悉菩提相」，即發大慈大悲，緣無作四實諦，起四弘誓願，是名圓教發菩提心。	004	all sentient beings have the characteristics of bodhi, one immediately gives rise to great compassion and great kindness, takes the four true realities without characteristics as the object, and gives rise to the four immeasurable vows. This is called giving rise to the bodhi mind in the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c28_11']	信心者，信一切眾生即是真性解脫，具足一體三寶，一心三觀；	信心者，信一切眾生即是真性解脫，具足一體三寶，一心三觀；	004	Faith means to believe that all sentient beings are the true nature of liberation, endowed with the one essence of the Three Jewels, and the three contemplations of one mind;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0540c29_14']	觀二諦、三諦理，通達無閡，成隨喜心，五品弟子因；	觀二諦、三諦理，通達無閡，成隨喜心，五品弟子因；	004	Contemplating the principles of the two truths and three truths, penetratingly understanding without obstruction, accomplishing the mind of rejoicing, the cause of the five categories of disciples;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a01_17']	是若得三昧，及陀羅尼六根清淨，即是入十信之位也；	是若得三昧，及陀羅尼六根清淨，即是入十信之位也；	004	If one attains samādhi and dhāraṇī, the purification of the six sense faculties, then one enters the stage of the ten abodes;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a04_11']	若得十信成就，即能見真諦理，斷界內見思，亦能見俗諦理，分別十法界法，心無謬亂，生相似中道之解，伏界外無明。	若得十信成就，即能見真諦理，斷界內見思，亦能見俗諦理，分別十法界法，心無謬亂，生相似中道之解，伏界外無明。	004	If one attains the accomplishment of the ten abodes, then one can see the principle of true reality, sever the views and thoughts within the realm, and also see the principle of conventional reality, discerning the dharmas of the ten dharma realms, the mind free from error or confusion, giving rise to the understanding of the semblance middle way, and subduing the ignorance outside the realm.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a04_19']	故《仁王經》云：	故《仁王經》云：	004	Therefore, the Renwang Jing says:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a05_14']	「十善菩薩發大心，長別三界苦輪海。	「十善菩薩發大心，長別三界苦輪海。	004	The bodhisattvas of the ten wholesome deeds give rise to the great mind, forever parting from the suffering of the three realms.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a06_6']	」《法華經》明意根清淨云：	」《法華經》明意根清淨云：	004	The Lotus Sutra clarifies the purification of the mind faculty, saying:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a07_6']	「雖未得菩薩無漏智慧，而其意根清淨如此。	「雖未得菩薩無漏智慧，而其意根清淨如此。	004	Although they have not yet attained the untainted wisdom of the bodhisattvas, their mind faculty is purified like this.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a07_20']	」二、明十住位者，即為二意：	」二、明十住位者，即為二意：	004	Second, clarifying the ten abodes. There are two points:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a08_6']	一，略釋初發心住；	一，略釋初發心住；	004	First, briefly explaining the initial stage of generating the mind of enlightenment;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a08_13']	二，類通九住。	二，類通九住。	004	Second, classifying the other nine abodes.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a10_1']	一、正釋初發心住位者，所言發心住者，三種心發故，名發心住；	一、正釋初發心住位者，所言發心住者，三種心發故，名發心住；	004	First, correctly explaining the initial stage of generating the mind of enlightenment. As for the stage of generating the mind of enlightenment, it is called generating the mind of enlightenment because three kinds of minds are generated;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a10_11']	三德涅槃，名為住也。	三德涅槃，名為住也。	004	The three virtues of nirvana are called abiding.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a10_20']	云何名為三種心發？	云何名為三種心發？	004	What are called the three kinds of minds being generated?
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a11_8']	一者，緣因善心發；	一者，緣因善心發；	004	First, the wholesome mind of the enabling cause is generated;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a11_17']	二者，了因慧心發；	二者，了因慧心發；	004	Second, the mind of wisdom of the penetrating cause is generated;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a12_4']	三者，正因理心發。	三者，正因理心發。	004	Third, the principle mind of the direct cause is generated.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a15_13']	一、緣因善心發者，眾生無量劫來，所有低頭、合掌，彈指、散華，發菩提心，慈悲、誓願，布施、持戒、忍辱、精進、禪定等，一切善根，一時開發，一心具足萬行諸波羅密也。	一、緣因善心發者，眾生無量劫來，所有低頭、合掌，彈指、散華，發菩提心，慈悲、誓願，布施、持戒、忍辱、精進、禪定等，一切善根，一時開發，一心具足萬行諸波羅密也。	004	First, as for the wholesome mind of the enabling cause being generated, sentient beings, over innumerable eons, have all bowed their heads, joined their palms, snapped their fingers, scattered flowers, generated the mind of enlightenment, had compassion and vows, practiced giving, upholding precepts, patience, vigor, and meditation, and all wholesome roots are developed at once, with a single mind fully endowed with the myriad practices and perfections.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a18_8']	二、了因慧心發者，眾生無量劫來，聞大乘乃至一句偈，受持、讀、誦、解說、書寫，觀行修習，所有智慧，一時開發，成真無漏也。	二、了因慧心發者，眾生無量劫來，聞大乘乃至一句偈，受持、讀、誦、解說、書寫，觀行修習，所有智慧，一時開發，成真無漏也。	004	Second, the arising of the discerning mind of the discerning cause: Sentient beings, over innumerable eons, have heard the Mahāyāna, even a single verse, and have received and upheld, read and recited, explained, copied, contemplated, and cultivated it. All their wisdom is suddenly awakened and becomes true and uncontaminated.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a20_13']	三、正因理心發者，眾生無始以來，佛性真心常為無明之所隱覆，緣、了兩因力破無明暗，豁然圓顯也。	三、正因理心發者，眾生無始以來，佛性真心常為無明之所隱覆，緣、了兩因力破無明暗，豁然圓顯也。	004	Third, the arising of the principle mind of the direct cause: Since beginningless time, the Buddha-nature and true mind of sentient beings have always been obscured by ignorance. The power of the two causes of conditions and discernment breaks through the darkness of ignorance and suddenly manifests completely.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a21_6']	此三種心開發，故名發心。	此三種心開發，故名發心。	004	Because these three kinds of minds are awakened, it is called arousing the mind.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a21_16']	住者，住三德涅槃也。	住者，住三德涅槃也。	004	Abiding means abiding in the three virtues of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a22_7']	一、法身，二、般若，三、解脫。	一、法身，二、般若，三、解脫。	004	First, the Dharma body; second, prajñā; third, liberation.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a23_2']	此三不縱不橫，如世「伊」字，名祕密藏。	此三不縱不橫，如世「伊」字，名祕密藏。	004	These three are neither sequential nor lateral, like the character i in the world, called the secret treasury.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a23_12', 'ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a24_1']	真實心發，即是法身；🔽了因心發，即是般若；	真實心發，即是法身； 了因心發，即是般若；	004	The arising of the true mind is precisely the Dharma body;🔽The arising of the discerning mind of the discerning cause is precisely prajñā;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a24_11']	緣因心發，即是解脫。	緣因心發，即是解脫。	004	The arising of the mind of the conditional cause is precisely liberation.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a26_15']	三心若發，同世「伊」字，假名行人，以不住法住此三心，即是住於三德涅槃祕密之藏，故言初發心住也。	三心若發，同世「伊」字，假名行人，以不住法住此三心，即是住於三德涅槃祕密之藏，故言初發心住也。	004	When these three minds arise, they are like the Chinese character I in the world. The practitioner is provisionally named based on these three minds, abiding in the non-abiding Dharma. This is precisely abiding in the secret treasury of the three virtues of nirvana. Therefore, it is called the initial stage of generating the mind.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541a28_17']	若住三德，即是住不思議解脫，即是住於大乘，即是以不住法住般若，即是住首楞嚴三昧；	若住三德，即是住不思議解脫，即是住於大乘，即是以不住法住般若，即是住首楞嚴三昧；	004	If one abides in the three virtues, then one abides in inconceivable liberation, abides in the Great Vehicle, and abides in prajñā through the Dharma of non-abiding. This is precisely abiding in the śūraṃgama samādhi;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541b05_3']	修持於心，猶如虛空，即是住法性，即是住實相，即是住如如，即是住如來藏，即是住中道第一義諦，即是住法界，即是住畢竟空，即是住大慈大悲、十力、四無畏、十八不共法，即是住四無閡智、神通、四攝、諸波羅密、一切三昧陀羅尼門。	修持於心，猶如虛空，即是住法性，即是住實相，即是住如如，即是住如來藏，即是住中道第一義諦，即是住法界，即是住畢竟空，即是住大慈大悲、十力、四無畏、十八不共法，即是住四無閡智、神通、四攝、諸波羅密、一切三昧陀羅尼門。	004	Cultivating and upholding the mind, which is like empty space, is precisely abiding in the nature of dharmas, abiding in the true aspect, abiding in suchness, abiding in the tathāgatagarbha, abiding in the Middle Way of ultimate truth, abiding in the Dharma realm, abiding in ultimate emptiness, abiding in great compassion, the ten powers, the four forms of fearlessness, and the eighteen distinctive abilities of the Buddha, abiding in the four forms of unobstructed cognition, spiritual powers, the four means of magnetizing, the perfections, and all samādhis and dhāraṇī gateways.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0541b06_2']	舉要言之，即是住真、應二身，一切佛法也。	舉要言之，即是住真、應二身，一切佛法也。	004	To summarize, it is precisely the two bodies of reality and response, and all the Buddha's teachings.

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545b15_12']	由處有跡，尋跡得處。	由處有跡，尋跡得處。	004	Because there is a place, there are traces, and by following the traces, one can find the place.

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545b24_17']	一、約理事明本迹者，此經云「從無住本，立一切法」，今明不思議理事為本迹者，「理」即不思議真諦之理為本，「事」即不思議俗諦之事為迹。	一、約理事明本迹者，此經云「從無住本，立一切法」，今明不思議理事為本迹者，「理」即不思議真諦之理為本，「事」即不思議俗諦之事為迹。	004	First, in terms of principle and phenomena, the scripture says, From the unmoving basis, all dharmas are established. Now, in terms of the inconceivable principle and phenomena as the basis and traces, principle refers to the inconceivable truth of ultimate reality as the basis, and phenomena refers to the inconceivable conventional reality of phenomenal appearances as the traces.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545b26_18']	由不思議真諦之理本，故有不思議俗諦之事迹，尋不思議俗諦之事迹，得不思議真諦之理本。	由不思議真諦之理本，故有不思議俗諦之事迹，尋不思議俗諦之事迹，得不思議真諦之理本。	004	Because of the inconceivable truth of ultimate reality as the basis, there are the inconceivable conventional reality of phenomenal appearances as the traces. By investigating the inconceivable conventional reality of phenomenal appearances as the traces, one attains the inconceivable truth of ultimate reality as the basis.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545b27_12']	是則本迹雖殊，不思議一也。	是則本迹雖殊，不思議一也。	004	This means that although the basis and traces are different, the inconceivable is one.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c01_13']	二、約理教明本迹者，此經云「三轉法輪於大千，其輪本來常清淨」，今言不思議之理本，即是不思議二諦之理事，通名為理，理即本也。	二、約理教明本迹者，此經云「三轉法輪於大千，其輪本來常清淨」，今言不思議之理本，即是不思議二諦之理事，通名為理，理即本也。	004	Second, in terms of principle and teachings, the scripture says, Turning the wheel of Dharma in the great trichiliocosm, that wheel is originally always pure. Now, the inconceivable truth as the basis refers to the inconceivable two truths of principle and phenomena, which are collectively called principle, and principle is the basis.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c03_3']	不思議之教迹者，即是大聖八音敷演不思議能詮二諦之教迹也。	不思議之教迹者，即是大聖八音敷演不思議能詮二諦之教迹也。	004	The inconceivable teaching traces refer to the eight sounds of the Great Sage expounding the inconceivable teaching traces that can expound the two truths.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c03_18']	所詮不思議二諦之理，即是理本；	所詮不思議二諦之理，即是理本；	004	The inconceivable principle of the two truths that is expounded is the principle basis;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c04_8']	能詮之教，即是事迹。	能詮之教，即是事迹。	004	The teaching that can expound it is the phenomenal traces.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c05_6']	是則由理本故有教迹，尋教迹以得理本。	是則由理本故有教迹，尋教迹以得理本。	004	This means that because there is the principle basis, there are the teaching traces; by investigating the teaching traces, one attains the principle basis.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c05_17']	本迹雖殊，不思議一也。	本迹雖殊，不思議一也。	004	Although the basis and traces are different, the inconceivable is one.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c08_16']	三、約理行明本迹者，如《法華經》云「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相，佛子行道已，來世得作佛」，今明不思議理本者，即是理教也，故此經云：	三、約理行明本迹者，如《法華經》云「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相，佛子行道已，來世得作佛」，今明不思議理本者，即是理教也，故此經云：	004	Third, in terms of principle and practice, clarifying the basis and traces, it is as the Lotus Sutra says: All dharmas from the beginning are always characterized by quiescent extinction. The Buddha's disciples, having practiced the Way, will become Buddhas in the future world. Now, clarifying the inconceivable principle basis is precisely the principle teaching. Therefore, this sutra says:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c09_6']	「無離文字，說解脫相；	「無離文字，說解脫相；	004	Apart from words, there is no explanation of the characteristic of liberation;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c09_17']	文字性離，即解脫也」。	文字性離，即解脫也」。	004	The nature of words is detached, which is liberation.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c10_12']	不思議行迹者，即是不思議觀行之事迹。	不思議行迹者，即是不思議觀行之事迹。	004	The inconceivable practice traces refer to the phenomenal traces of inconceivable contemplation practice.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c11_14']	由不思議理教之理本，得修不思議觀行之事迹；	由不思議理教之理本，得修不思議觀行之事迹；	004	The inconceivable principle and teaching are the fundamental, and the practice of inconceivable contemplation is the trace;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c13_8']	修觀行不思議事迹，能契不思議之理本，故曰「本迹雖殊，不思議一也」。	修觀行不思議事迹，能契不思議之理本，故曰「本迹雖殊，不思議一也」。	004	The practice of inconceivable contemplation is able to accord with the inconceivable principle, therefore it is said the fundamental and the trace are different, but the inconceivability is one.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c14_8']	四、約體用明本迹者，即是法身為體，應身為用。	四、約體用明本迹者，即是法身為體，應身為用。	004	Fourth, explaining the fundamental and trace in terms of essence and function, the Dharma body is the essence, and the response body is the function.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c15_4']	故《金光明經》云「佛真法身，由如虛空；	故《金光明經》云「佛真法身，由如虛空；	004	Therefore the Golden Light Sūtra says The true Dharma body of the Buddha is like empty space;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c16_15']	應物現形，如水中月」，正由虛空有實月之本體，故有一切水月之影用。	應物現形，如水中月」，正由虛空有實月之本體，故有一切水月之影用。	004	Responding to beings and manifesting form is like the moon in water. Precisely because empty space has the real moon as its fundamental essence, there are the functions of all the reflections of the moon in water.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c18_8']	今明理行合為不思議法身之理本，由此法身，故能垂不思議應用之迹；	今明理行合為不思議法身之理本，由此法身，故能垂不思議應用之迹；	004	Now, explaining the principle and practice combined as the fundamental principle of the inconceivable Dharma body, based on this Dharma body, one is able to manifest the traces of inconceivable responsive function;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c18_18']	由此應用，能顯法身。	由此應用，能顯法身。	004	Based on this responsive function, one is able to reveal the Dharma body.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c20_12']	故肇師云「非本無以垂迹，非迹無以顯本」，本迹雖殊，不思議一，即其義也。	故肇師云「非本無以垂迹，非迹無以顯本」，本迹雖殊，不思議一，即其義也。	004	Therefore, Master ZHAO said, Without the root, there would be no manifestation of the traces; without the traces, there would be no revelation of the root. Although the root and traces are different, they are one in the inconceivable. This is the meaning.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c22_1']	五、約權實明本迹者，實則齊位，證得真應二身，即是理實之本也。	五、約權實明本迹者，實則齊位，證得真應二身，即是理實之本也。	004	Fifth, regarding the distinction of root and traces in terms of provisional and actual, the actual is the attainment of the two bodies of reality and response at the same stage, which is the root of principle and reality.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c23_15']	權化方便，現真應二身，或高或下，此即是事隨物情，故名事迹也，故此經云：	權化方便，現真應二身，或高或下，此即是事隨物情，故名事迹也，故此經云：	004	The provisional transformation manifests the two bodies of reality and response, either high or low, which is the trace that follows the feelings of beings. Therefore, this sutra says:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c24_14']	「雖復示現成道，起轉法輪，而不捨菩薩行。	「雖復示現成道，起轉法輪，而不捨菩薩行。	004	Although he manifests the attainment of enlightenment, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma, he does not abandon the bodhisattva practices.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c26_5']	」今明若不由不思議位證真、應二身，理實之本，豈能垂高下真應兩迹！	」今明若不由不思議位證真、應二身，理實之本，豈能垂高下真應兩迹！	004	Now, if one does not attain the two bodies of reality and response through the inconceivable stage, how can one manifest the high and low traces of reality and response?
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c27_11']	若不垂真、應之事迹，豈能令物同己入位，得真、應二身！	若不垂真、應之事迹，豈能令物同己入位，得真、應二身！	004	If one does not manifest the traces of reality and response, how can one cause beings to enter the stage and attain the two bodies of reality and response?
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c28_3']	是則本迹雖殊，不思議一也。	是則本迹雖殊，不思議一也。	004	This means that although the root and traces are different, they are one in the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0545c29_1']	第三、辨本迹高下者，正約圓教以明也。	第三、辨本迹高下者，正約圓教以明也。	004	Third, distinguishing the high and low of the fundamental and traces, is precisely about clarifying it based on the perfect teaching.

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547a04_18']	即用此約佛法學問、坐禪、一切行人心行高下，自行化他得失，具作四句分別：	即用此約佛法學問、坐禪、一切行人心行高下，自行化他得失，具作四句分別：	004	It is precisely using this to distinguish the high and low of the mind and conduct of those who study the Buddha's teachings, sit in meditation, and engage in all practices, as well as the gains and losses of self-cultivation and teaching others, by making a fourfold distinction:
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547a05_11']	一、本迹俱高，即是實行之人；	一、本迹俱高，即是實行之人；	004	First, the original and trace are both lofty, which is the person of true practice;

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547a13_20']	或用三藏通教本迹，入空開化國王、長者；	或用三藏通教本迹，入空開化國王、長者；	004	Or using the original and subsequent of the Tripiṭaka and Shared Teachings, entering emptiness to transform the king and elder;

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547a17_5']	二、通室內者，室內託疾興教，示於病行，同一切眾生之實病。	二、通室內者，室內託疾興教，示於病行，同一切眾生之實病。	004	Second, the general explanation of the inner room: in the inner room, the teaching is raised based on the illness, demonstrating the practice of illness, the same as the actual illness of all sentient beings.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547a18_4']	眾生之疾，雖有多塗，論其正意，不出四種。	眾生之疾，雖有多塗，論其正意，不出四種。	004	Although the illnesses of sentient beings have many paths, discussing their main points, they do not go beyond four kinds.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547a19_17']	今以四種之迹病行，同四種之實病，即是現病行之迹，為〈問疾品〉也。	今以四種之迹病行，同四種之實病，即是現病行之迹，為〈問疾品〉也。	004	Now, using the four kinds of traces of the practice of illness, the same as the four kinds of actual illnesses, this is the manifestation of the traces of the practice of illness, which is the chapter on Inquiring about Illness.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547a20_21']	次下五品皆從此品出，若通〈問疾品〉，下五品皆自通也。	次下五品皆從此品出，若通〈問疾品〉，下五品皆自通也。	004	The next five chapters all come from this chapter. If the chapter on Inquiring about Illness is understood, the following five chapters are all understood.

Although this Dharma cannot be spoken, it is spoken in accordance with conditions using the four siddhāntas;
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547b01_6']	佛亦於不可說，用四悉檀赴緣說此三淨之法；	佛亦於不可說，用四悉檀赴緣說此三淨之法；	004	The Buddha also, in the unspeakable, uses the four siddhāntas to speak this Dharma of the three purities in accordance with conditions;

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547b03_15']	淨名說三淨之法，即是說佛三淨之法，故此經云「觀身實相，觀佛亦然」。	淨名說三淨之法，即是說佛三淨之法，故此經云「觀身實相，觀佛亦然」。	004	Vimalakīrti's explanation of the three pure dharmas is precisely the Buddha's explanation of the three pure dharmas, so this sūtra says, Contemplate the true characteristics of the body, and contemplate the Buddha in the same way.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547b07_2']	復次，淨名說自法，非但即是說佛法，亦即是說一切眾生法也，故下文云「眾生、賢聖、彌勒，一切法，一如無二如」也，《華嚴經》云「心佛及眾生，是三無差別」。	復次，淨名說自法，非但即是說佛法，亦即是說一切眾生法也，故下文云「眾生、賢聖、彌勒，一切法，一如無二如」也，《華嚴經》云「心佛及眾生，是三無差別」。	004	Furthermore, Vimalakīrti's explanation of his own Dharma is not only the Buddha's Dharma, but also the Dharma of all sentient beings, so the text below says, Sentient beings, sages, Maitreya, and all dharmas are one suchness, without a second suchness. The Huayan Sūtra says, The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are without distinction.
['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547b08_3']	今但說淨名法，即是說佛法，亦即說眾生法也。	今但說淨名法，即是說佛法，亦即說眾生法也。	004	Now, simply explaining Vimalakīrti's Dharma is explaining the Buddha's Dharma and also explaining the Dharma of sentient beings.

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547b12_2']	淨名說自法門，即是說於佛法，即是說眾生法。	淨名說自法門，即是說於佛法，即是說眾生法。	004	Vimalakirti expounds his own Dharma gate, which is expounding the Buddha Dharma, which is expounding the Dharma of sentient beings.

['ZH_T38_1777_004:0547b16_6']	如《大智論》云「若佛弟子、化人、諸天、仙人所說，為佛所印，皆稱為經」，此經佛為寶積開宗，辨於佛國因果，命諸弟子皆述往日為大士所訶，佛默印之；	如《大智論》云「若佛弟子、化人、諸天、仙人所說，為佛所印，皆稱為經」，此經佛為寶積開宗，辨於佛國因果，命諸弟子皆述往日為大士所訶，佛默印之；	004	As the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says, If it is spoken by the Buddha's disciples, transformed beings, various gods, or sages, and is approved by the Buddha, it is all called a sutra. In this sutra, the Buddha opens the school for Ratnasaṃbhava and discusses the causes and effects of the Buddha lands, and then instructs his disciples to recount how they were reprimanded by the great beings in the past, and the Buddha silently approves of it;
