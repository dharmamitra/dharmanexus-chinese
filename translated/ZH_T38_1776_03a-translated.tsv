Therefore, the sūtra proclaims that the two dharmas of birth and death are the tathāgatagarbha, the aggregates are buddha-nature, the twelve links of dependent arising are buddha-nature, and so forth. Exhausting the understanding of this nature is true liberation, therefore it is sought in the mental activities of sentient beings.
