The remaining impure dharmas are eliminated by the path of cultivation. All pure dharmas are not eliminated.

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0790c16_7']	一離縛斷、二離境斷。	一離縛斷、二離境斷。	The first is the severing of bonds, and the second is the severing of objects.

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0790c21_18']	若法是結及一果等對治生時，於彼得斷，名自性斷。	若法是結及一果等對治生時，於彼得斷，名自性斷。	When the antidote to a dharma that is a bond and a single fruit, etc. arises, one attains severing with regard to it, called natural severing.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0790c23_7']	由彼斷故，於所緣事便得離繫，不必於中得不成就，名所緣斷。	由彼斷故，於所緣事便得離繫，不必於中得不成就，名所緣斷。	Due to the severing of that [bond], one attains disjunction with regard to the objective realm, but one does not necessarily attain non-accomplishment with regard to it, called objective severing.

When the fetters are gradually eliminated, at the time of the arising of the disjunction [achievements] on the individual natures of each category, those fetters and one fruit and so forth are all called already eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a01_17']	彼不染污有漏無色及有漏色并彼諸得生等法上，諸離繫得爾時未起，未名為斷，由彼諸法唯隨彼地最後無間道所斷故，非諸見道能隨地別漸次離欲。	彼不染污有漏無色及有漏色并彼諸得生等法上，諸離繫得爾時未起，未名為斷，由彼諸法唯隨彼地最後無間道所斷故，非諸見道能隨地別漸次離欲。	The disjunction achievements on the uncontaminated formless [aggregates], defiled form, and the dharmas such as birth that arise with them, have not yet arisen at that time, and are not yet called eliminated, because those dharmas are only eliminated by the final uninterrupted paths of each stage, and the path of seeing cannot gradually eliminate desire by distinguishing the stages.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a02_15']	云何能斷不染等法非六生法非見斷者？	云何能斷不染等法非六生法非見斷者？	How can one eliminate the uncontaminated and other dharmas, but not the dharmas born of the six [sense bases] and those eliminated by seeing?
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a03_6']	緣色等境外門轉故。	緣色等境外門轉故。	Because they revolve externally, taking form and so forth as objects.

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a07_0']	眼見色同分，　　非識見因故，	眼見色同分，　　非識見因故，	The eye sees the same kind of form, not the consciousness, because it is the cause of seeing.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a08_13']	識類無別故，　　不觀障色故。	識類無別故，　　不觀障色故。	Because the classes of consciousness are not different, and because it does not observe obstructed form.

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a16_14']	此中眼根如前已說，世共了故、觀照性故、闇相違故、用明利故，說眼名見。	此中眼根如前已說，世共了故、觀照性故、闇相違故、用明利故，說眼名見。	The eye faculty has already been explained above, because it is commonly understood in the world, because its nature is that of illumination, because it is in opposition to darkness, and because its function is that of clear vision. Therefore, it is said that the eye sees.

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a19_17']	無學正見，謂無學身中決度無漏慧。	無學正見，謂無學身中決度無漏慧。	Correct views of those no longer learning refer to the uncontaminated wisdom of those who have attained final liberation in the body of those no longer learning.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a20_6']	一正見言具攝三種。	一正見言具攝三種。	The word correct view includes all three types.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a21_14']	別開三者，為顯異生、學、無學地三見別故，又顯漸次修習生故。	別開三者，為顯異生、學、無學地三見別故，又顯漸次修習生故。	The reason for distinguishing them into three is to show the differences between the views of ordinary beings, those still learning, and those no longer learning, and also to show that they arise through gradual practice.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a22_4']	如是諸見總類有五：	如是諸見總類有五：	These various views can be divided into five general categories:

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791a26_20']	染污類中五見是見，餘染污慧悉皆非見，謂貪、瞋、慢、不共無明、疑俱生慧，餘染污法亦皆非見。	染污類中五見是見，餘染污慧悉皆非見，謂貪、瞋、慢、不共無明、疑俱生慧，餘染污法亦皆非見。	In the defiled class, the five views are seeing, but the other defiled wisdoms are not seeing, namely, the wisdoms associated with craving, hatred, pride, unique ignorance, and doubt, and the other defiled dharmas are also not seeing.

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b02_16']	有餘師說，意識相應善有漏慧亦有非見，謂五識身所引發慧、發有表慧、命終時慧。	有餘師說，意識相應善有漏慧亦有非見，謂五識身所引發慧、發有表慧、命終時慧。	Other masters say that the wholesome and contaminated wisdom associated with mental consciousness is also not seeing, namely, the wisdom elicited by the five sense consciousnesses, the wisdom that gives rise to intimation, and the wisdom at the moment of death.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b03_14']	又於此善有漏類中，五識俱生慧亦非見。	又於此善有漏類中，五識俱生慧亦非見。	Also, in this class of wholesome and contaminated dharmas, the wisdom co-arising with the five sense consciousnesses is also not seeing.

The other mental activities are not views. Only discernment with these characteristics can judge and determine, because it evolves in a state of thorough consideration of its object.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b08_9']	非所遮慧能於所緣審慮決度，是故非見。	非所遮慧能於所緣審慮決度，是故非見。	The discernment that is excluded above is not able to thoroughly consider and judge and determine its object, and therefore it is not a view.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b09_8']	言決度者，謂於境界審慮為先決擇究竟。	言決度者，謂於境界審慮為先決擇究竟。	The term judge and determine means that, with regard to an object, one first thoroughly considers it and then finally decides on it.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b10_7']	非五識身相應諸慧於已了境能審了知。	非五識身相應諸慧於已了境能審了知。	The discernment associated with the five consciousnesses is not able to thoroughly know an object that has already been perceived.

['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b12_10']	意識中慧，能於境界審慮為先決擇究竟，可名為見。	意識中慧，能於境界審慮為先決擇究竟，可名為見。	Discernment in the sixth or mental consciousness is able to thoroughly consider an object, decide on it, and therefore can be called seeing.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b13_13']	其五識身無分別故，彼相應慧無此功能，故不名見。	其五識身無分別故，彼相應慧無此功能，故不名見。	The five consciousnesses are devoid of discrimination and, therefore, the discernment associated with them is not capable of this and, therefore, is not called seeing.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b14_8']	若爾，眼根既無此相，應不名見。	若爾，眼根既無此相，應不名見。	If this is so, then since the eye does not have this characteristic, it should not be called seeing.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b15_17']	豈不先說，世共了故、觀照性故、闇相違故、用明利故，眼亦名見。	豈不先說，世共了故、觀照性故、闇相違故、用明利故，眼亦名見。	Didn't we say earlier that it is called seeing because it is commonly understood as such, because it has the nature of illumination, because it is opposed to darkness, and because its function is clear and sharp?
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b16_1']	契經亦言：	契經亦言：	A scripture also says:
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b16_15']	眼見諸色，故說眼根能見諸色。	眼見諸色，故說眼根能見諸色。	The eye sees various forms, therefore it is said that the eye faculty can see various forms.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b17_8']	若眼見者，何不同時得一切境？	若眼見者，何不同時得一切境？	If the eye sees, why doesn't it simultaneously obtain all objects?
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b18_3']	無斯過失，許少分眼能見色故。	無斯過失，許少分眼能見色故。	There is no such fault, because it is admitted that a small part of the eye can see forms.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b18_8']	少分者何？	少分者何？	What is this small part?
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b18_18']	謂同分眼、同分眼根。	謂同分眼、同分眼根。	It refers to the homogeneous eye, the homogeneous eye faculty.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b19_12']	如前已說，識所住持乃成同分。	如前已說，識所住持乃成同分。	As explained before, it becomes homogeneous when it is sustained by consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b20_11']	非一切根同時自識各所住持，故無斯咎。	非一切根同時自識各所住持，故無斯咎。	Not all faculties simultaneously sustain their own consciousnesses, therefore there is no fault in this.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b21_15']	若爾，即應彼能依識是見非眼，要眼識生方能見故。	若爾，即應彼能依識是見非眼，要眼識生方能見故。	If this is so, then the consciousness that depends on it should be seeing, not the eye, because it is only when eye consciousness arises that there can be seeing.
['ZH_T29_1563_004:0791b22_10']	不爾，眼識力所住持，勝用生故。	不爾，眼識力所住持，勝用生故。	This is not so, because the eye consciousness is powerfully sustained and its superior function arises.
