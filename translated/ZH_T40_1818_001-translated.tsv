['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786a21_4']	「經曰歸命一切諸佛菩薩」，前歸敬申造論意請威靈加護，此歸敬集經者欲出佛經亦請威靈加護。	「經曰歸命一切諸佛菩薩」，前歸敬申造論意請威靈加護，此歸敬集經者欲出佛經亦請威靈加護。	The sutra says: 'I take refuge in all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.'

['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786a24_18']	一辨二經同異、二敘斯論製作之方。	一辨二經同異、二敘斯論製作之方。	The first is to distinguish the similarities and differences between the two sutras, and the second is to describe the method of composition of this treatise.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786a26_11']	二經同異者，即羅什所譯經及留支所出帶論之經，其文不同凡有五種：	二經同異者，即羅什所譯經及留支所出帶論之經，其文不同凡有五種：	As for the similarities and differences between the two sutras, there are five main differences between the sutra translated by Kumarajiva and the sutra with commentary brought by Dharmaraksha:
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786a29_16']	一者舊經略、論經廣，如舊經歎羅漢德唯有五句、論經有十六句，或可梵本廣略不同，或可聲聞常眾無會不集處處歎之，故羅什略歎其德也。	一者舊經略、論經廣，如舊經歎羅漢德唯有五句、論經有十六句，或可梵本廣略不同，或可聲聞常眾無會不集處處歎之，故羅什略歎其德也。	First, the old sūtra is concise while the treatise sūtra is extensive. For example, the old sūtra praises the merits of the arhats with only five phrases, while the treatise sūtra has sixteen phrases. It may be that the Sanskrit originals differ in length, or it may be that the śrāvakas always gather in assemblies and are praised everywhere, so Kumārajīva concisely praises their merits.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b02_2']	天親欲示解一經歎德，令譏眾經歎德之意，故廣說也。	天親欲示解一經歎德，令譏眾經歎德之意，故廣說也。	Vasubandhu wishes to show the understanding of praising the merits of a single sūtra, and to convey the meaning of praising the merits of many sūtras, so he explains it extensively.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b03_11']	二舊經廣而論經略，如〈方便品〉，舊經為十句，謂如是相如是性等。	二舊經廣而論經略，如〈方便品〉，舊經為十句，謂如是相如是性等。	Second, the old sūtra is extensive while the treatise sūtra is concise. For example, in the chapter on skillful means, the old sūtra has ten phrases, such as such characteristics, such natures, and so forth.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b04_10']	論經唯有五門，當是天親以略攝廣故也。	論經唯有五門，當是天親以略攝廣故也。	The treatise sūtra only has five aspects. This is probably because Vasubandhu summarizes the extensive in the concise.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b05_5']	三二經同無廣略，如歎菩薩德。	三二經同無廣略，如歎菩薩德。	Third, the two sūtras are the same without being extensive or concise. For example, in praising the merits of the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b06_2']	四品次前後，舊經〈屬累〉在〈藥王〉之前。	四品次前後，舊經〈屬累〉在〈藥王〉之前。	Fourth, the sequence of chapters is different. The old sūtra places the chapter on entrusting to the chapter on the Medicine King.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b06_12']	論經在〈普賢〉之後。	論經在〈普賢〉之後。	The treatise sūtra places it after the chapter on Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b07_2']	羅什依於義意，是故在前；	羅什依於義意，是故在前；	Kumārajīva follows the meaning, and therefore places it first;
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b07_14']	天親同經常法，所以在後。	天親同經常法，所以在後。	Vasubandhu's usual method is the same, so he is placed later.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b09_6']	五名義不同，舊經稱六十二億恒河沙菩薩、論經稱六十二億恒河沙佛。	五名義不同，舊經稱六十二億恒河沙菩薩、論經稱六十二億恒河沙佛。	Fifth, the names and meanings are different. The old sūtra says sixty-two koṭīs of nayutas of Ganges sands of bodhisattvas, while the treatise sūtra says sixty-two koṭīs of nayutas of Ganges sands of Buddhas.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b09_19']	羅什依經文譯之，故云菩薩；	羅什依經文譯之，故云菩薩；	Kumārajīva translated it based on the sūtra text, so it says bodhisattvas;
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b12_13']	論取義意歎釋其福正等，顯初地菩薩得真如法身故即是佛，以觀音與六十二億法身不二，故言福平等，所以稱佛。	論取義意歎釋其福正等，顯初地菩薩得真如法身故即是佛，以觀音與六十二億法身不二，故言福平等，所以稱佛。	The treatise takes the meaning to praise and explain that their blessings are exactly equal, showing that the bodhisattvas of the first ground attain the true suchness Dharma body and are therefore Buddhas. Since Avalokiteśvara and the sixty-two koṭīs of Dharma bodies are non-dual, it says their blessings are equal, so it calls them Buddhas.
['ZH_T40_1818_001:0786b14_2']	次明論製作不同者，如龍樹釋經，不預開章門，至後追詺於前。	次明論製作不同者，如龍樹釋經，不預開章門，至後追詺於前。	Next, clarifying the differences in the composition of the treatise. Nāgārjuna's interpretation of the sūtra does not include opening the chapter headings, but at the end he gives them retroactively.

The Prajnaparamita Sutra, the Surangama Sutra, and the Lion's Roar Sutra, if according to such texts, then the One Vehicle is also the cause, and there is no difference with the great.

When it reaches this sutra, the two effects are not ultimate, only the Buddha's effect is ultimate. Therefore, the One Vehicle is biased towards the Buddha's effect.
