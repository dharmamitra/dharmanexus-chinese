['ZH_T36_1736_033:0254c12_10']	」謂若不造業，識不成種，如穀不入田，終不生故。	」謂若不造業，識不成種，如穀不入田，終不生故。	It means that if karma is not created, consciousness cannot become seeds, just as grains will never grow if not planted in fields.

['ZH_T36_1736_033:0254c15_3']	今但約本識含於種子能起現行，故以本識為田。	今但約本識含於種子能起現行，故以本識為田。	Now, it is only in terms of the fundamental consciousness containing seeds and being able to give rise to actual dharmas, so the fundamental consciousness is taken as the field.
['ZH_T36_1736_033:0254c17_3']	若初地中，亦云「於三界田中復生苦芽」，則約當果生處亦得名田，顯義無方也。	若初地中，亦云「於三界田中復生苦芽」，則約當果生處亦得名田，顯義無方也。	If it is said in the first ground that in the field of the three realms, the sprouts of suffering are born again, then it is also taken as the field in terms of the place where the future fruit is born, showing that the meaning is unrestricted.
['ZH_T36_1736_033:0254c17_13']	成不相知，類前可解。	成不相知，類前可解。	The establishment of mutual non-awareness can be understood by analogy with the previous explanation.
