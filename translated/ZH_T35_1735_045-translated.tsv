['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b08_9']	初明來意，先辨會來。	初明來意，先辨會來。	First, explaining the reason for coming. First, distinguishing the reason for the assembly.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b08_14']	會來有二：	會來有二：	There are two reasons for the assembly:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b10_1', 'ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b11_14']	一約圓融，謂前明普門中所具差別正位，故寄歷人天；🔽今明位後德用不離普門，是則會別入普有此會來，重會普光意在斯矣。	一約圓融，謂前明普門中所具差別正位，故寄歷人天； 今明位後德用不離普門，是則會別入普有此會來，重會普光意在斯矣。	First, in terms of perfect interfusion, it means that the previous explanation of the universally manifested gates includes the differentiated correct positions, therefore it is entrusted to the human and heavenly realms;
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b12_11']	等妙二位，全同如來普光明智故。	等妙二位，全同如來普光明智故。	Now, it explains that the virtues and functions after the positions do not leave the universally manifested gates. This is the assembly of entering the universal from the specific. The reason for the assembly is in this. The two positions of equal and wondrous are completely the same as the Tathāgata's universally manifested wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b13_11']	二約次第，前明十地，今顯等妙二覺故來。	二約次第，前明十地，今顯等妙二覺故來。	Second, in terms of sequence, it means that the previous explanation of the ten grounds now reveals the two awakenings of equal and wondrous, therefore it comes.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b14_7']	以極果由於始信，故重會普光。	以極果由於始信，故重會普光。	Because the ultimate fruit comes from the initial faith, therefore it reassembles at the universally manifested.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b15_15']	謂前依本不動智體起差別之位，今位極成果不離本智之因。	謂前依本不動智體起差別之位，今位極成果不離本智之因。	It means that previously, based on the essence of the immovable wisdom, the differentiated positions are produced. Now, the ultimate position in fruition does not leave the original wisdom as the cause.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b16_17']	後出現因果，因是果中之因，得果不捨因故；	後出現因果，因是果中之因，得果不捨因故；	Later, the cause and effect of manifestation, the cause is the cause within the effect, because the effect is attained without abandoning the cause;
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b17_11']	果是果中之果，大用無涯故。	果是果中之果，大用無涯故。	The effect is the effect within the effect, because the great function is boundless.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b18_8']	二品來者，為答第二會中十定問故。	二品來者，為答第二會中十定問故。	The two chapters come because they answer the question of the ten samādhis in the second assembly.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b18_13']	第二釋名。	第二釋名。	Second, explaining the names.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b18_18']	會名有二：	會名有二：	There are two names for the assembly:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b20_8']	約處，名重會普光明殿會，由第二會已曾會此故，重意如前。	約處，名重會普光明殿會，由第二會已曾會此故，重意如前。	In terms of the location, it is called the second assembly in the Hall of Universal Light, because the second assembly has already been held here, and the meaning of second is as explained above.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b20_17']	約法，明說普法會。	約法，明說普法會。	In terms of the Dharma, it is called the assembly for explaining the universal Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b23_7']	二品名者，定謂心一境性，十是數之圓極，以普賢深定妙用無涯，寄十以顯無盡，故云十定品，即帶數釋。	二品名者，定謂心一境性，十是數之圓極，以普賢深定妙用無涯，寄十以顯無盡，故云十定品，即帶數釋。	As for the names of the two chapters, samādhi refers to the mind being focused on one object, and ten is the perfect culmination of numbers. Using Samantabhadra's profound samādhi and boundless wondrous function, it relies on the ten to manifest infinity, thus it is called the chapter on the ten samādhis, which is a compound word.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b25_9']	若依梵本，具云「如來十三昧品」，以等覺三昧上同佛故，三世諸佛之所行，故云如來三昧。	若依梵本，具云「如來十三昧品」，以等覺三昧上同佛故，三世諸佛之所行，故云如來三昧。	If following the Sanskrit text, it is fully called the chapter on the Tathāgata's samādhi, because the samādhi of the stage of supreme enlightenment is the same as that of the Buddha, and it is practiced by the buddhas of the three times, thus it is called the Tathāgata's samādhi.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b26_5']	譯家以義通因果，故略如來二字。	譯家以義通因果，故略如來二字。	The translators have omitted the word Tathāgata for the sake of brevity, as the meaning includes both cause and effect.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b27_16']	然三昧為定，雖非敵對，由等持心至一境故，義旨相順，從略云定。	然三昧為定，雖非敵對，由等持心至一境故，義旨相順，從略云定。	Although samādhi and concentration are not exact equivalents, since the mind of equipoise reaches a single object, the meaning is consistent, so it is abbreviated as concentration.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b28_20']	又別行本名「等目菩薩所問三昧經」，皆人法雙舉。	又別行本名「等目菩薩所問三昧經」，皆人法雙舉。	Moreover, the separately circulated edition is titled The Sūtra on Samādhi Asked by Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, which mentions both the person and the Dharma.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840b29_13']	梵本是依主釋，別行即依士釋。	梵本是依主釋，別行即依士釋。	The Sanskrit version is a compound of the dominant and dependent, while the separately circulated edition is a compound of the dependent and dominant.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c02_1']	三宗趣者，會以普賢因果德用圓備為宗，令物證入為趣。	三宗趣者，會以普賢因果德用圓備為宗，令物證入為趣。	As for the purport and significance, the assembly takes the perfection of Samantabhadra's causal and resultant virtues and functions as its purport, and taking sentient beings to realize it as its significance.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c03_3']	品以普賢三昧無礙自在無邊大用而為宗趣。	品以普賢三昧無礙自在無邊大用而為宗趣。	The chapter takes Samantabhadra's unobstructed, sovereign, and boundless great functions as its purport and significance.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c03_8']	次正釋文。	次正釋文。	Next, the text is explained.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c03_19']	此會有十一品經，分二：	此會有十一品經，分二：	This assembly has eleven chapters of sūtra, divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c04_11']	前六明因圓、後五明果滿。	前六明因圓、後五明果滿。	The first six clarify the perfection of causes, and the latter five clarify the perfection of results.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c05_13']	若依古德，前九明生解因果、後二明平等因果。	若依古德，前九明生解因果、後二明平等因果。	If following the ancient masters, the first nine clarify the causes and results of generating understanding, and the latter two clarify the causes and results of equality.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c05_18']	前中亦二：	前中亦二：	The former is also divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c06_17']	前六品明位後因相、後三品明差別果相。	前六品明位後因相、後三品明差別果相。	The first six chapters clarify the characteristics of the subsequent causes of the stages, while the last three chapters clarify the characteristics of the differentiated results.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c08_2']	然六品之因，若約次第，與前五會俱是差別之因。	然六品之因，若約次第，與前五會俱是差別之因。	However, as for the causes in the six chapters, if we discuss them in terms of sequence, they are all causes of differentiation along with the previous five assemblies.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c10_7']	若約圓融，等同果相故與果同會，果是對因之果與因同會，平等因果由差別成，亦與此同會。	若約圓融，等同果相故與果同會，果是對因之果與因同會，平等因果由差別成，亦與此同會。	If we discuss them in terms of perfect interfusion, they are the same as the characteristics of the results, and therefore they are the same assembly as the results. The results are results in response to causes, and they are the same assembly as the causes. Equalized causes and results are formed through differentiation, and they are also the same assembly as this.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c12_17']	今初，此因即是等覺，然文有等覺之義而無等覺之名者，以此等覺亦即十地之勝進故，是以諸教開合不同。	今初，此因即是等覺，然文有等覺之義而無等覺之名者，以此等覺亦即十地之勝進故，是以諸教開合不同。	Now, at the beginning, this cause is precisely equal enlightenment. However, there is the meaning of equal enlightenment in the text but not the name of equal enlightenment, because this equal enlightenment is also precisely the superior progress of the ten grounds. Therefore, the various teachings differ in their combination and division.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c15_17']	《仁王經》等合此勝進入於十地，是以不立等覺，故〈教化品〉中約五忍分位，於寂滅忍唯有上下，下忍中行名為菩薩，即第十地；	《仁王經》等合此勝進入於十地，是以不立等覺，故〈教化品〉中約五忍分位，於寂滅忍唯有上下，下忍中行名為菩薩，即第十地；	The Benevolent Kings Sūtra and other sūtras combine this superior progress into the ten grounds, and therefore they do not establish equal enlightenment. Therefore, in the chapter on teaching and transforming, they divide the stages according to the five forbearances. Within the forbearance of quiescent extinction, there is only superior and inferior. The practice in the inferior forbearance is called a bodhisattva, which is the tenth ground;
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c16_12']	上忍中行為薩婆若，此謂如來。	上忍中行為薩婆若，此謂如來。	The middle stage of the upper patience is for sarvajña, which refers to the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c17_12']	若依《瓔珞》，開此勝進為無垢地，即是等覺。	若依《瓔珞》，開此勝進為無垢地，即是等覺。	If we rely on the Ornament of the Scriptures on the Stages of the Bodhisattva Path, this superior progress is divided into the stage of no outflows, which is equivalent to the stage of equivalence enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c18_4']	然等覺照寂、妙覺寂照。	然等覺照寂、妙覺寂照。	However, the stage of equivalence enlightenment illuminates quiescence, while the wondrous enlightenment is the quiescence of illumination.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c19_5']	又〈賢聖學觀品〉中說六種性，及六堅、六忍等。	又〈賢聖學觀品〉中說六種性，及六堅、六忍等。	Moreover, in the chapter on the contemplation of sages and saints, it speaks of six kinds of natures, six kinds of firmness, six kinds of patience, and so forth.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c19_14']	《瑜伽》具有二義：	《瑜伽》具有二義：	The Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra has both meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c23_2']	七十八引《深密經》說十一地，第十法雲、十一說名佛地，唯有二十二愚，得佛地時由斷二愚，一於一切所知境極微細著愚，即俱生極微細所知障種；	七十八引《深密經》說十一地，第十法雲、十一說名佛地，唯有二十二愚，得佛地時由斷二愚，一於一切所知境極微細著愚，即俱生極微細所知障種；	The seventy-eighth chapter cites the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, which speaks of eleven stages, with the tenth being the cloud of dharmas and the eleventh being called the stage of the Buddha. There are only twenty-two kinds of foolishness. When one attains the stage of the Buddha, by eliminating two kinds of foolishness, one, the foolishness of extremely subtle attachment to all objects of knowledge, which is the seeds of the extremely subtle obstacle to that which is to be known that is innate;
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c23_18']	二極微細礙愚，即是任運煩惱障種。	二極微細礙愚，即是任運煩惱障種。	two, the foolishness of extremely subtle obstruction, which is the seeds of the innate obstacle of the passions.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c24_16']	斷此便能證大菩提，更不別說等覺斷證。	斷此便能證大菩提，更不別說等覺斷證。	Eliminating these, one is then able to realize great enlightenment. It does not separately speak of the elimination and realization of equivalence enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c25_8']	論復有文，亦立等覺。	論復有文，亦立等覺。	The treatise also has passages that establish equivalence enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c27_4']	又〈菩薩地〉云「此菩薩雖已修行功德海滿，由未能捨三種法故，不名妙覺。	又〈菩薩地〉云「此菩薩雖已修行功德海滿，由未能捨三種法故，不名妙覺。	Moreover, the Bodhisattva Stage says: Although this bodhisattva has already cultivated the ocean of merits and virtues, he is not called 'wondrously enlightened' because he has not yet abandoned three kinds of dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0840c29_6']	一由未捨劣無漏法、二由未捨白淨無記法、三由未捨有漏善法，至妙覺位方捨此三。	一由未捨劣無漏法、二由未捨白淨無記法、三由未捨有漏善法，至妙覺位方捨此三。	First, because he has not yet abandoned the inferior pure dharmas; second, because he has not yet abandoned the pure and indeterminate dharmas; third, because he has not yet abandoned the defiled wholesome dharmas. Only at the stage of wondrous enlightenment does he abandon these three.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a01_6']	」今經欲顯開合無礙，故存其義不彰其名。	」今經欲顯開合無礙，故存其義不彰其名。	Now, this sutra wishes to show the unobstructed interpenetration of the open and the closed, so it retains the meaning but does not display the names.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a02_15']	下〈離世間品〉智慧助道具中既云隨順六堅固法，有等覺明矣。	下〈離世間品〉智慧助道具中既云隨順六堅固法，有等覺明矣。	In the chapter on the wisdom and skillful means for leaving the world, it says that one should follow the six firm and solid dharmas, which clearly shows the stage of equal enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a03_2']	文中分二：	文中分二：	The text is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a03_18']	前三品正答前問、後三品總顯深廣。	前三品正答前問、後三品總顯深廣。	The first three chapters directly answer the previous question, while the last three chapters comprehensively reveal the profound and vast.

['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a05_3']	前二品明業用廣大、後一品明智慧深玄。	前二品明業用廣大、後一品明智慧深玄。	The first two chapters discuss the vastness of karmic activity, while the last chapter discusses the profoundness of wisdom.

['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a09_4']	初總顯三成就、二「始成」下別顯三成就、三「與十佛剎」下別顯眾成就。	初總顯三成就、二「始成」下別顯三成就、三「與十佛剎」下別顯眾成就。	First, generally revealing the three accomplishments; second, from just accomplished revealing the three accomplishments; third, from together with the buddhas of ten buddha-lands revealing the accomplishment of the assembly.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a09_9']	二中分三：	二中分三：	The second is divided into three:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a10_20']	初約主顯時、二「於普光明」下約主彰處、三「入剎那」下就德顯主。	初約主顯時、二「於普光明」下約主彰處、三「入剎那」下就德顯主。	First, about the host revealing the time; second, from in the universal light about the host manifesting the place; third, from entering the instant using virtue to reveal the host.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a12_11']	於中十句，即攝二十一種功德中二十別句，總句即前始成正覺故。	於中十句，即攝二十一種功德中二十別句，總句即前始成正覺故。	Among them, there are ten sentences, which include twenty separate sentences among the twenty-one merits, and the general sentence is the just accomplished perfect enlightenment mentioned above.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a13_7']	一入剎那際三昧者，即窮法真源。	一入剎那際三昧者，即窮法真源。	First, entering the instant samādhi is precisely exhausting the true source of dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a14_7']	謂時之極促名曰剎那，窮彼剎那時相都寂。	謂時之極促名曰剎那，窮彼剎那時相都寂。	That is to say, the extreme brevity of time is called an instant, exhausting that instant, the characteristics of time are completely still.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a15_14']	無際之際名剎那際，即攝二句，謂二行永絕及達無相法。	無際之際名剎那際，即攝二句，謂二行永絕及達無相法。	The limit of no limit is called the instant limit, which includes two sentences, namely the two practices forever severed and penetrating to the dharma of no characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a16_15']	若有二行則有剎那，二行既絕則剎那無際。	若有二行則有剎那，二行既絕則剎那無際。	If there were two activities, then there would be a moment. Since the two activities are already cut off, the moment is without limit.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a18_11']	由達清淨真如本無相故，所以此中特名入剎那際者，為顯將說等覺位故。	由達清淨真如本無相故，所以此中特名入剎那際者，為顯將說等覺位故。	Because one penetrates the pure true suchness that is originally without characteristics, therefore this is specifically called entering the moment. It is in order to reveal what is about to be explained as the stage of equal enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a19_13']	菩薩地盡唯有果累無常，生相未寂猶名識藏。	菩薩地盡唯有果累無常，生相未寂猶名識藏。	At the end of the stage of the bodhisattva, there is only the result of accumulation, which is impermanent. The appearance of birth is not yet tranquil, and is still called the storehouse of consciousness.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a21_3']	若以無間智覺心初起，心無初相，遠離微細念故，即無剎那。	若以無間智覺心初起，心無初相，遠離微細念故，即無剎那。	If one uses uninterrupted cognition to awaken to the mind's initial arising, the mind has no initial characteristic, and is far removed from subtle thoughts, therefore there is no moment.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a22_8']	若入此際，即見心性常住，名究竟覺，故云諸佛三昧。	若入此際，即見心性常住，名究竟覺，故云諸佛三昧。	If one enters this moment, then one sees the nature of the mind as always abiding, and is called ultimate enlightenment. Therefore it is said to be the samādhi of all buddhas.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a23_5']	亦顯差別歷位不離最初剎那際故。	亦顯差別歷位不離最初剎那際故。	It also reveals that the various stages are not apart from the initial moment.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a24_7']	二以一切智自神通力現如來身者，依通起用。	二以一切智自神通力現如來身者，依通起用。	Second, using the power of one's own spiritual powers of omniscience to manifest the body of a tathāgata is based on spiritual powers to give rise to function.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a24_12']	此攝二句：	此攝二句：	This includes two phrases:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a26_5']	一切智通即住於佛住，謂由一切智無有功用自神通力常作佛事故；	一切智通即住於佛住，謂由一切智無有功用自神通力常作佛事故；	The spiritual powers of omniscience are abiding in the abode of the buddhas. It means that due to the power of one's own spiritual powers of omniscience without effort, one always performs the affairs of the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a27_13']	次現如來身，即攝得佛平等，謂依上一切智現身利樂有情故。	次現如來身，即攝得佛平等，謂依上一切智現身利樂有情故。	Next, manifesting the Tathāgata's body, one immediately attains the equality of the Buddha, meaning that based on the above omniscience, one manifests the body to benefit and delight sentient beings.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a28_13']	三清淨無礙，攝三句，謂清淨攝二句：	三清淨無礙，攝三句，謂清淨攝二句：	Third, purity and unobstruction encompass three phrases, namely, purity encompasses two phrases:
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841a29_16']	一攝到無障處，謂慣習覺慧永斷所治，故云清淨。	一攝到無障處，謂慣習覺慧永斷所治，故云清淨。	First, encompassing reaching the unobstructed state, meaning that through habitual wisdom one permanently cuts off what is to be eliminated, thus it is called purity.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841b01_14']	二攝不可轉法，由清淨故，他不能轉。	二攝不可轉法，由清淨故，他不能轉。	Second, encompassing the Dharma that cannot be turned back, because of purity, others cannot turn it back.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841b02_13']	無礙者即所行無礙，世間八法不能礙故。	無礙者即所行無礙，世間八法不能礙故。	Unobstructed means the activity is unobstructed, because the eight worldly dharmas cannot obstruct it.
['ZH_T35_1735_045:0841b03_11']	四無所依止無有攀緣，即立不思議。	四無所依止無有攀緣，即立不思議。	Fourth, without support and without grasping, this establishes the inconceivable.
