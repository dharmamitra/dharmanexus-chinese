['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b18_1']	若於爾時不施設有補特伽羅，還同前過。	若於爾時不施設有補特伽羅，還同前過。	If at that time one does not designate a pudgala, then one falls into the same error as before.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b18_19']	般涅槃者既不可得，是故決定無實涅槃。	般涅槃者既不可得，是故決定無實涅槃。	Since one who enters nirvāṇa is unobtainable, therefore nirvāṇa definitely does not exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b21_6']	以於世間都未曾見無貪等者有貪等故，設復計有涅槃所依，是則涅槃有所依故，應如貪等其性無常。	以於世間都未曾見無貪等者有貪等故，設復計有涅槃所依，是則涅槃有所依故，應如貪等其性無常。	Because in the world we have never seen those who are free from greed, etc., to have greed, etc. Even if one imagines that nirvana has a basis, then because nirvana would have a basis, it should be impermanent by nature, like greed, etc.

['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b24_12']	言涅槃者，永滅眾相離諸散動。	言涅槃者，永滅眾相離諸散動。	Nirvana is the eternal cessation of characteristics and the abandonment of all discursive thoughts.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b26_10']	」此經義言，一切世間散動妄見皆永離故，彼所發起所取能取相永滅故，證得涅槃。	」此經義言，一切世間散動妄見皆永離故，彼所發起所取能取相永滅故，證得涅槃。	 The meaning of this sutra says that because all the discursive thoughts and false views of the world are eternally abandoned, the characteristics of the grasped and grasper that arise from them are eternally extinguished, and one realizes nirvana.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b27_8']	是故涅槃決定非是一切有執所依緣處。	是故涅槃決定非是一切有執所依緣處。	Therefore, nirvana is definitely not a basis or object for all attachments to existence.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b28_16']	有說二句知其次第，涅槃永滅所緣眾相，永離一切能緣散動。	有說二句知其次第，涅槃永滅所緣眾相，永離一切能緣散動。	Some say that the two phrases indicate the sequence: nirvana is the eternal cessation of the characteristics as objects, eternally abandoning all discursive thoughts as subjects.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192b29_15']	涅槃既絕眾相散動，不可以有而取涅槃。	涅槃既絕眾相散動，不可以有而取涅槃。	Since nirvāṇa is utterly devoid of the scattering and agitation of characteristics, nirvāṇa cannot be grasped as existent.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c01_14']	然經說有涅槃界等，為破撥無涅槃者見。	然經說有涅槃界等，為破撥無涅槃者見。	However, the sūtras speak of the realm of nirvāṇa, etc., in order to destroy the view that denies the existence of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c04_6']	有執生死無始無終，決定無有般涅槃界，故佛說有煩惱眾苦熾火永滅般涅槃界，無生無滅無相無為究竟安樂。	有執生死無始無終，決定無有般涅槃界，故佛說有煩惱眾苦熾火永滅般涅槃界，無生無滅無相無為究竟安樂。	There are those who cling to the idea that saṃsāra has no beginning and no end, and that there definitely is no realm of nirvāṇa. Therefore the Buddha spoke of the realm of nirvāṇa, where the blazing fire of afflictions and suffering is extinguished forever, which is unborn, unceasing, devoid of characteristics, unconditioned, and ultimately peaceful and blissful.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c06_4']	此立道理，顯生死火非常相續永無滅期，從眾緣生有損惱故，猶如世間山林熾火。	此立道理，顯生死火非常相續永無滅期，從眾緣生有損惱故，猶如世間山林熾火。	This establishes the principle and shows that the fire of saṃsāra is not a permanent continuity, and that there is never a time when it is extinguished. Because it arises from various conditions and causes harm, it is like the blazing fire in a mountain forest in the world.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c09_10']	謂生死苦雖無始來依眾緣生相續無斷，若遇善友聞法修行，無漏聖道現在前時，滅諸煩惱不起諸業，後苦不續，名曰涅槃，譬如世間薪盡火滅。	謂生死苦雖無始來依眾緣生相續無斷，若遇善友聞法修行，無漏聖道現在前時，滅諸煩惱不起諸業，後苦不續，名曰涅槃，譬如世間薪盡火滅。	That is to say, although the suffering of saṃsāra has arisen from various conditions since beginningless time and continues without interruption, if one encounters a good friend and hears the Dharma, when the uncontaminated holy path appears, one extinguishes the afflictions and does not create karma, and the subsequent suffering does not continue, which is called nirvāṇa, like the extinction of a fire when the firewood is exhausted in the world.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c10_17']	然此涅槃聖道所證，究竟寂滅離諸性相，永絕一切分別戲論。	然此涅槃聖道所證，究竟寂滅離諸性相，永絕一切分別戲論。	However, this nirvāṇa is realized by the holy path, the ultimate quiescence, free from all natures and characteristics, forever transcending all conceptual proliferation and disputation.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c11_16']	所以契經種種宣說，皆為方便除妄見執。	所以契經種種宣說，皆為方便除妄見執。	Therefore, the sūtras expound it in various ways, all as skillful means to eliminate false views and attachments.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c12_15']	諸有智者應正覺知，勿謂涅槃是有無等。	諸有智者應正覺知，勿謂涅槃是有無等。	The wise should correctly understand that nirvāṇa is not existence, non-existence, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c13_14']	若於生死起諸分別，易作方便令其斷除。	若於生死起諸分別，易作方便令其斷除。	If one gives rise to various discriminations regarding saṃsāra, it is easy to employ skillful means to eliminate them.
['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c15_3']	若於涅槃起諸分別，其病深固難可救療，是故不應執有無等。	若於涅槃起諸分別，其病深固難可救療，是故不應執有無等。	If one gives rise to various discriminations regarding nirvāṇa, the illness is deep and solid, difficult to cure. Therefore, one should not cling to existence, non-existence, etc.

['ZH_T30_1571_002:0192c18_9']	為破彼執，故說頌曰：	為破彼執，故說頌曰：	To refute this attachment, a verse is spoken:

In this way, the two things are not separate from desire. In order to fulfill desire, the sense faculties and objects unite, and according to the appearing objects, thought immediately experiences them.
