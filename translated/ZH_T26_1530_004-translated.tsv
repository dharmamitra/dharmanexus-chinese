The meaning of this analogy is that just as the great void pervades all forms, accommodating form and not being separated from it, but always transforming accordingly, although forms appear to arise and disappear, the nature of space is neither arising nor disappearing.
['ZH_T26_1530_004:0306c18_16']	如是如來清淨法界遍一切境，含容一切智所變化利眾生事，不相捨離一向隨轉，智等雖有現生現滅，而淨法界無生無滅。	如是如來清淨法界遍一切境，含容一切智所變化利眾生事，不相捨離一向隨轉，智等雖有現生現滅，而淨法界無生無滅。	In the same way, the pure dharma realm of the Tathāgata pervades all objects, accommodating all the transformations of wisdom that benefit sentient beings, without being separated from them, but always transforming accordingly.

The transformations of wisdom in the pure dharma realm that benefit sentient beings are also like this.

Since this was mostly the case before a thousand years, it is said that the true Dharma of the Buddha lasts only a thousand years, but the teachings of the Buddha do not remain only for a thousand years.

Only after a thousand years did the two different theories of emptiness and existence arise.
['ZH_T26_1530_004:0307a11_18']	是故說言如來正法但經千載，而淨法界無增無減者，如來聖教就世俗理有增有減，非就勝義法界為性，無增減故。	是故說言如來正法但經千載，而淨法界無增無減者，如來聖教就世俗理有增有減，非就勝義法界為性，無增減故。	Therefore, it is said that the Tathāgata's true Dharma lasts only a thousand years. As for the pure dharma realm having no increase or decrease, the Tathāgata's holy teachings have increase and decrease in terms of conventional truth, but not in terms of ultimate truth, because the dharma realm has no increase or decrease as its nature.

Having the dharma realm as their nature, they have no increase or decrease. In terms of ultimate truth, they are like empty space, having no characteristics of increase or decrease.

In terms of conventional truth, consciousness and so forth appear to have increase and decrease, but not in terms of the true nature of the pure dharma realm, because form and other dharmas are all apart from the characteristics of conceptual proliferation and discrimination.

Therefore, the various forms therein are also boundless and inexhaustible.

They cause the cognition to give rise to an image that appears to be combined with form, etc. Because it is seen in the world that all causes and effects, although not combined or separated, can be causes. Therefore, there is no definite combination of the two characteristics of cause and effect.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
