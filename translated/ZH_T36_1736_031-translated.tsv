['ZH_T36_1736_031:0233a12_9']	然賢首意，始教別開信位。	然賢首意，始教別開信位。	However, the meaning of the Xian-bei is to separately open the stage of faith in the distinct teaching.

['ZH_T36_1736_031:0233a18_1']	」又彼論及《佛性論》皆云地前修四種行，謂十信修信樂大乘行、十解修般若行、十行修三昧行、十迴向修大悲行，如其次第即是四位故。	」又彼論及《佛性論》皆云地前修四種行，謂十信修信樂大乘行、十解修般若行、十行修三昧行、十迴向修大悲行，如其次第即是四位故。	 Moreover, both that treatise and the Buddha Nature Treatise all say that one cultivates four kinds of practices before the grounds, namely the ten faiths cultivate the practice of believing and delighting in the Great Vehicle, the ten understandings cultivate the practice of prajñā, the ten practices cultivate the practice of samādhi, and the ten dedications cultivate the practice of great compassion, which are the four stages in order.
['ZH_T36_1736_031:0233a20_13']	又為除四類障正使故，即此四位，謂初除闡提不信障、二除外道我執障、三除聲聞畏苦障、四除獨覺捨大悲障。	又為除四類障正使故，即此四位，謂初除闡提不信障、二除外道我執障、三除聲聞畏苦障、四除獨覺捨大悲障。	Moreover, it is in order to eliminate the four kinds of obstacles and their latent tendencies, which are precisely these four stages, namely the first eliminates the obstacle of unbelief of icchantikas, the second eliminates the obstacle of self-attachment of non-Buddhists, the third eliminates the obstacle of fear of suffering of śrāvakas, and the fourth eliminates the obstacle of abandoning great compassion of pratyekabuddhas.
