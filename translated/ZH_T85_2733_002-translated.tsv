['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a27_1']	即說彼情名一合執情所執境名一合相。	即說彼情名一合執情所執境名一合相。	It is said that the consciousness of those beings is called the consciousness of grasping a single whole, and the object grasped by that consciousness is called the appearance of a single whole.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a27_12']	又釋此執行相相執無別。	又釋此執行相相執無別。	Another explanation says that the characteristics of the consciousness and the grasping of characteristics are not separate.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a28_1']	言即非一合相者。	言即非一合相者。	As for saying it is not the appearance of a single whole,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a28_10']	以勝義中情有理無。	以勝義中情有理無。	it is because in the ultimate truth, the consciousness of beings is reasonable but non-existent.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b07_11']	貞觀云。	貞觀云。	Zhenguan says:

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b09_14']	此何所顯示。	此何所顯示。	What does this reveal?
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b10_1']	世諦言說故。	世諦言說故。	Because of the conventional expressions of the worldly truth,

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b13_1']	經。	經。	The sūtra says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b13_14']	但凡夫之人貪著其事　演曰。	但凡夫之人貪著其事　演曰。	Only ordinary beings are attached to those things. The commentary says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b14_12']	明俗諦有凡夫不了法體無故妄生法執。	明俗諦有凡夫不了法體無故妄生法執。	It clarifies that the conventional truth exists. Because ordinary beings do not understand that the substance of phenomena is nonexistent, they falsely give rise to the grasping of phenomena.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b15_7']	法執起故我執亦生增愛貪等。	法執起故我執亦生增愛貪等。	Because of the arising of dharma-attachment, self-attachment also arises, increasing craving and so forth.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b16_5']	彼小兒凡夫如言說取非第一義。	彼小兒凡夫如言說取非第一義。	Those childish ordinary beings grasp according to words, not the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b16_16']	彼論妄執意亦同此頌云。	彼論妄執意亦同此頌云。	The meaning of the treatise's false attachment is also the same as this verse, which says:

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b18_10']	釋意以彼聚集無物可取。	釋意以彼聚集無物可取。	The meaning of the explanation is that since the collection has no substance to be grasped,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b19_5']	但隨於聲虛妄分別故是顛倒。	但隨於聲虛妄分別故是顛倒。	it is only according to sounds, falsely discriminated, and therefore upside down.
