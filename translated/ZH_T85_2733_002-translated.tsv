['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a06_14']	若世界若微塵界故。	若世界若微塵界故。	002	Because of the world and the atom world.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a10_11']	冥然一故但名一摶。	冥然一故但名一摶。	002	Vaguely one, therefore only called one grasping.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a11_1']	微塵眾多執為一摶。	微塵眾多執為一摶。	002	Many atoms are grasped as one grasping,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a11_12']	實有差別故名差別摶取。	實有差別故名差別摶取。	002	Actually having distinctions, therefore called grasping as distinctions.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a12_6']	一及差別此中總名為一合相。	一及差別此中總名為一合相。	002	One and distinctions are generally called the appearance of one combination in this context.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a13_5']	經言世界似唯名身其一合相即兼微塵。	經言世界似唯名身其一合相即兼微塵。	002	The sutra says the world is like only the name-body, and the appearance of one combination also includes atoms.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a16_4']	亦同小乘心心所實皆是法執。	亦同小乘心心所實皆是法執。	002	It is also the same as the Hinayana, where mind and mental factors are all real and are all the grasping of dharmas.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a17_1']	彼論第三破界實有故。	彼論第三破界實有故。	002	Because in the third chapter of that treatise, the reality of the realms is refuted.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a19_18']	法身無相總界亦無法喻相似。	法身無相總界亦無法喻相似。	002	The Dharma body is without characteristics, and in general, realms also have no similar metaphors.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a20_8']	又界若實有可喻塵異。	又界若實有可喻塵異。	002	Moreover, if the realms really existed, they could be used as a metaphor for the difference in dust.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a22_17']	如來說一合相至是名一合相　演曰。	如來說一合相至是名一合相　演曰。	002	The Tathagata speaks of the characteristics of a single combination, and this is called the characteristics of a single combination.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a23_17']	後佛重成。	後佛重成。	002	and later the Buddha reaffirms it.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a24_1']	此初也。	此初也。	002	This is the first.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a24_13']	梁唐本名一合執據能執心。	梁唐本名一合執據能執心。	002	The Liang and Tang editions call it the grasping of a single combination, based on the grasping mind.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a25_3']	此但言相依所執境。	此但言相依所執境。	002	This only speaks of characteristics based on the grasped objects.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a25_12']	言如來說一合相者。	言如來說一合相者。	002	It says the Tathagata speaks of the characteristics of a single combination.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a26_2']	於俗諦中有言說故。	於俗諦中有言說故。	002	Because in the conventional truth there is verbal expression.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a27_1']	即說彼情名一合執情所執境名一合相。	即說彼情名一合執情所執境名一合相。	002	It is said that the consciousness of those beings is called the consciousness of grasping a single whole, and the object grasped by that consciousness is called the appearance of a single whole.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a27_12']	又釋此執行相相執無別。	又釋此執行相相執無別。	002	Another explanation says that the characteristics of the consciousness and the grasping of characteristics are not separate.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a28_1']	言即非一合相者。	言即非一合相者。	002	As for saying it is not the appearance of a single whole,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a28_10']	以勝義中情有理無。	以勝義中情有理無。	002	it is because in the ultimate truth, the consciousness of beings is reasonable but non-existent.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048a29_1']	成真諦中情亦非有故。	成真諦中情亦非有故。	002	It is because the consciousness in the true reality is also non-existent.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b01_2']	論云此上座須菩提安立第一義故結文可知。	論云此上座須菩提安立第一義故結文可知。	002	The treatise says that this Upāsaka Subhūti establishes the ultimate truth, and the concluding text can be understood.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b02_15']	彼論第四存假謂顯如來說一合相大千界等非有實體但相無差名一合耳。	彼論第四存假謂顯如來說一合相大千界等非有實體但相無差名一合耳。	002	That treatise's fourth section on preserving the provisional says that the Tathāgata's teaching of the appearance of a single whole in the great trichiliocosm, etc., is not a real substance, but is only called a single whole because of the undifferentiated appearance.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b03_1']	經。	經。	002	Sūtra:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b04_1']	佛言須菩提一合相者即是不可說　演曰。	佛言須菩提一合相者即是不可說　演曰。	002	The Buddha said, Subhūti, the appearance of a single whole is precisely the inexpressible. Commentary:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b04_8']	後佛重成有二。	後佛重成有二。	002	Later, the Buddha reiterates it in two ways.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b04_14']	初明勝義無。	初明勝義無。	002	First, he clarifies the non-existence in the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b04_20']	後明俗諦有。	後明俗諦有。	002	Later, he clarifies the existence in the conventional truth.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b05_4']	此即初也。	此即初也。	002	This is the first part.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b07_7']	謂佛了達色及名身摶取之相勝義中無不可以言說說及分別戲論心之所分別以心言路絕故。	謂佛了達色及名身摶取之相勝義中無不可以言說說及分別戲論心之所分別以心言路絕故。	002	It means that the Buddha thoroughly understands that the characteristics of grasping form and names do not exist in the ultimate truth, and cannot be spoken of with words or discriminated by the mind of conceptual proliferation, because the mind and speech are cut off.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b07_11']	貞觀云。	貞觀云。	002	Zhenguan says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b08_1']	不可言說不可戲論。	不可言說不可戲論。	002	It cannot be spoken of and cannot be conceptually proliferated.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b08_5']	此論云。	此論云。	002	This treatise says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b08_18']	世尊成就如是義故說摶取者。	世尊成就如是義故說摶取者。	002	Because the World-Honored One has accomplished such meanings, he speaks of grasping.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b09_8']	即是不可以言說說等。	即是不可以言說說等。	002	This is precisely what cannot be spoken of with words, etc.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b09_14']	此何所顯示。	此何所顯示。	002	What does this reveal?
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b10_1']	世諦言說故。	世諦言說故。	002	Because of the conventional expressions of the worldly truth,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b10_10']	有彼摶取第一義故。	有彼摶取第一義故。	002	there is that grasping. Because of the ultimate truth,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b10_14']	不可說。	不可說。	002	it cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b11_5']	彼論第二如來釋成有二。	彼論第二如來釋成有二。	002	That treatise's second explanation of the Tathāgata has two parts.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b11_10']	初體實無。	初體實無。	002	The first is the absence of an actual substance.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b11_15']	後妄執有。	後妄執有。	002	The latter is the false grasping of existence.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b11_19']	此初也。	此初也。	002	This is the first.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b12_11']	以聚集相無實體性故不可說。	以聚集相無實體性故不可說。	002	Because the characteristics of aggregation have no real substance, they cannot be spoken of.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b13_1']	經。	經。	002	The sūtra says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b13_14']	但凡夫之人貪著其事　演曰。	但凡夫之人貪著其事　演曰。	002	Only ordinary beings are attached to those things. The commentary says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b14_12']	明俗諦有凡夫不了法體無故妄生法執。	明俗諦有凡夫不了法體無故妄生法執。	002	It clarifies that the conventional truth exists. Because ordinary beings do not understand that the substance of phenomena is nonexistent, they falsely give rise to the grasping of phenomena.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b15_7']	法執起故我執亦生增愛貪等。	法執起故我執亦生增愛貪等。	002	Because of the arising of dharma-attachment, self-attachment also arises, increasing craving and so forth.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b15_10']	論云。	論云。	002	The treatise says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b16_5']	彼小兒凡夫如言說取非第一義。	彼小兒凡夫如言說取非第一義。	002	Those childish ordinary beings grasp according to words, not the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b16_16']	彼論妄執意亦同此頌云。	彼論妄執意亦同此頌云。	002	The meaning of the treatise's false attachment is also the same as this verse, which says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b17_0']	但隨於音聲　　凡夫取顛倒	但隨於音聲　　凡夫取顛倒	002	Only according to sounds, ordinary beings grasp upside down.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b18_10']	釋意以彼聚集無物可取。	釋意以彼聚集無物可取。	002	The meaning of the explanation is that since the collection has no substance to be grasped,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b19_5']	但隨於聲虛妄分別故是顛倒。	但隨於聲虛妄分別故是顛倒。	002	it is only according to sounds, falsely discriminated, and therefore upside down.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b19_14']	若有實者即是正見。	若有實者即是正見。	002	If there were true reality, it would be right view.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b20_4']	上來彼論非但喻顯。	上來彼論非但喻顯。	002	Up to this point, the treatise not only illustrates with metaphors,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b21_7']	真化一異亦是因破我法二見所緣境無即同此論。	真化一異亦是因破我法二見所緣境無即同此論。	002	the oneness or difference of the true and the transformed is also a reason to refute the object-condition of the two views of self and dharmas, which is the same as this treatise.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b21_18']	此論第一無所見方便訖。	此論第一無所見方便訖。	002	This treatise's first expedient of nothing to be seen is finished.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b23_12']	即無能見。	即無能見。	002	This is the absence of the able seer.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b24_6']	前破我法所緣之境令知不實。	前破我法所緣之境令知不實。	002	Previously, the object-condition of self and dharmas was refuted, causing one to know it is not real.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b25_5', 'ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b25_15']	今破能緣我法見心見心乃是所起分別。🔽今翻令作無分別心故。	今破能緣我法見心見心乃是所起分別。 今翻令作無分別心故。	002	Now, the mind that sees the self and dharmas that are able to be the objects of cognition is the discriminating mind that arises.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b26_4']	言如所不分別也。	言如所不分別也。	002	Now, it is overturned to make it a non-discriminating mind, therefore it is said as it is, not discriminating.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b26_7']	論云。	論云。	002	The treatise says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b26_15']	已說無所見方便。	已說無所見方便。	002	The expedient means of having nothing to see has already been explained.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b27_1']	破義未說。	破義未說。	002	The meaning of destruction has not yet been explained.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b27_15']	無所見等入相應三昧時不分別。	無所見等入相應三昧時不分別。	002	When entering the samādhi of non-seeing and so forth, one does not discriminate.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b28_4']	謂如所不分別等。	謂如所不分別等。	002	It is said as it is, not discriminating and so forth.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b28_18']	云何得顯示如外道說我如來說。	云何得顯示如外道說我如來說。	002	How is it shown? As the non-Buddhists say, the Tathāgata speaks of self.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048b29_9']	為我見故安置人無我。	為我見故安置人無我。	002	For the sake of the view of self, he establishes the non-self of persons.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c01_5']	又為說有此我見故安置法無我。	又為說有此我見故安置法無我。	002	And because he speaks of the existence of this view of self, he establishes the non-self of dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c01_15']	若有彼我見是見所攝。	若有彼我見是見所攝。	002	If there is that view of self, it is included in views.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c02_14']	菩薩入相應三昧時不復分別。	菩薩入相應三昧時不復分別。	002	when the bodhisattva enters the samādhi of non-discrimination, he no longer discriminates.

['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c03_4']	為入方便。	為入方便。	002	is the expedient means for entering.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c03_7']	演曰。	演曰。	002	The commentary says:
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c03_12']	由執我者。	由執我者。	002	Because of grasping the self,
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c04_6']	說彼為見明人無我名無我見也。	說彼為見明人無我名無我見也。	002	it is said to be a view. Clarifying the non-self of persons is called the view of non-self.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c05_4']	執有此見名為法執明見亦是法無我。	執有此見名為法執明見亦是法無我。	002	Grasping at the existence of this view is called grasping at dharmas. Clearly seeing is also the selflessness of dharmas.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c05_17']	彼論自下明其法合文亦為二。	彼論自下明其法合文亦為二。	002	The treatise below clarifies the correspondence with the Dharma. The text is also divided into two parts.
['ZH_T85_2733_002:0048c06_3']	初離我執。	初離我執。	002	The first is the abandonment of grasping at self.
