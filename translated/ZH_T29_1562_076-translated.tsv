The unobstructed eloquence of dharmas, 2. The unobstructed eloquence of meanings, 3. The unobstructed eloquence of words, and 4. The unobstructed eloquence of discernment. These four are generally said to be, in order, the knowledge of the non-retrogression of the path of names, meanings, expressions, and eloquence, which takes them as its essence.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751a07_2']	謂無退智緣能詮法名句文身立為第一，趣所詮義說之為名，即是表召法自性義。	謂無退智緣能詮法名句文身立為第一，趣所詮義說之為名，即是表召法自性義。	076	That is, the first is established on the basis of names, phrases, and syllables that are the means of expression. The second is established on the basis of the meaning that is expressed.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751a08_1']	辯所詮義說之為句，即是辯了法差別義。	辯所詮義說之為句，即是辯了法差別義。	076	The third is established on the basis of the phrases that express the meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751a09_8']	不待義聲獨能為覺生所依託說之為文，即是迦遮吒多波等。	不待義聲獨能為覺生所依託說之為文，即是迦遮吒多波等。	076	Syllables are able to serve as the basis for the arising of cognition without depending on the sound of the meaning.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751a10_16']	理應有覺不待義聲，此覺不應無所緣境，此所緣境說之為文。	理應有覺不待義聲，此覺不應無所緣境，此所緣境說之為文。	076	It is reasonable that there should be cognition that does not depend on the sound of the meaning. This cognition should not be without an object. This object is called a syllable.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751a12_14']	文謂不能親目於義，但與名句為詮義依，此三能持諸所詮義及軌生解，故名為法。	文謂不能親目於義，但與名句為詮義依，此三能持諸所詮義及軌生解，故名為法。	076	A syllable is unable to directly indicate the meaning. It only serves as the basis for the expression of meaning by names and phrases. These three are able to hold all the expressed meanings and give rise to understanding. Therefore, they are called dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751a13_13']	即三自性說之為身，自性體身名差別故。	即三自性說之為身，自性體身名差別故。	076	The three intrinsic natures are called bodies, because the intrinsic nature and body are different names.

It is difficult to know their distinct characteristics when they give rise to cognition as objects. Therefore, the word body is used to show that they have a separate substance.

['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751a22_9']	謂此但取依語起名、名所顯義，非取汎爾心之所行說名為義。	謂此但取依語起名、名所顯義，非取汎爾心之所行說名為義。	076	That is, it only grasps the meaning that is manifested by names that arise based on words, and it does not grasp the meaning that is the object of the mind in general.

This knowledge is called the unobstructed understanding of eloquence.

['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751b25_10']	契經略舉此數及名，諸對法中廣顯其相。	契經略舉此數及名，諸對法中廣顯其相。	076	The scriptures briefly mention these numbers and names, while the Abhidharma treatises extensively reveal their characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751b27_17']	又經列此先義後法，諸對法中先法後義，此為顯示二智生時，或義因名、或名因義，故經與論作差別說。	又經列此先義後法，諸對法中先法後義，此為顯示二智生時，或義因名、或名因義，故經與論作差別說。	076	Moreover, the scriptures list them first by meaning and then by dharma, while the Abhidharma treatises list them first by dharma and then by meaning. This is to show that when the two knowledges arise, either the meaning is based on the name or the name is based on the meaning. Therefore, the scriptures and treatises make distinctions in their explanations.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c01_4']	謂聽法者先分別名，既正知名次尋其義，正知義已欲為他說，次必應求無滯說智，依此次第故名在先。	謂聽法者先分別名，既正知名次尋其義，正知義已欲為他說，次必應求無滯說智，依此次第故名在先。	076	That is to say, the listener first distinguishes the name. Having correctly known the name, he next seeks its meaning. Having correctly known the meaning, he wishes to explain it to others. Next, he must seek the knowledge of explaining without obstruction. Based on this sequence, the name comes first.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c02_3']	然此四中義智最勝，餘是助伴，故義在先。	然此四中義智最勝，餘是助伴，故義在先。	076	However, among these four, the knowledge of meaning is the most excellent, while the others are its auxiliaries. Therefore, meaning comes first.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c04_10']	謂於義中若正了達，次應方便尋究其名，既已知名欲為他說，次應於說求巧便智，是故此四次第如是。	謂於義中若正了達，次應方便尋究其名，既已知名欲為他說，次應於說求巧便智，是故此四次第如是。	076	That is to say, if one correctly understands the meaning, he should next use skillful means to investigate its name. Having already known the name, he wishes to explain it to others. Next, he should seek the knowledge of skillful explanation. Therefore, the sequence of these four is as follows.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c05_8']	辯無礙解若緣說時，何異第三詞無礙解？	辯無礙解若緣說時，何異第三詞無礙解？	076	If the unobstructed understanding of explanation takes speech as its object when arising, how is it different from the third unobstructed understanding of speech?
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c06_16']	第三了達訓釋言詞，如有變礙故名色等，此達應理無滯礙說。	第三了達訓釋言詞，如有變礙故名色等，此達應理無滯礙說。	076	The third is the understanding of the etymological explanations of words, such as that which is capable of obstruction is called form, etc. This understanding is unobstructed in explaining in accordance with reason.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c06_19']	有說：	有說：	076	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c07_15']	詞詮諸法自性，辯能顯示諸法差別。	詞詮諸法自性，辯能顯示諸法差別。	076	Words express the intrinsic natures of dharmas, and discernment is able to reveal the distinctions among dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c07_18']	有說：	有說：	076	Some say:
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c09_4']	於法直說名詞，展轉無滯分析名辯，緣此二種三四有別。	於法直說名詞，展轉無滯分析名辯，緣此二種三四有別。	076	Directly speaking about dharmas is called words, and the uninterrupted analysis of them is called discernment. The two are distinguished by the four.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c10_12']	四中法詞俗智為性，非無漏智緣名身等，及世言詞事境界故。	四中法詞俗智為性，非無漏智緣名身等，及世言詞事境界故。	076	Among the four, the nature of the unobstructed understanding of dharmas and words is worldly cognition, not pure cognition, because it takes as its object the collection of names, etc., and worldly expressions.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c12_10']	法無礙解通依五地，謂依欲界、四本靜慮，上地中無名身等故，彼不別緣下名等故。	法無礙解通依五地，謂依欲界、四本靜慮，上地中無名身等故，彼不別緣下名等故。	076	The unobstructed understanding of dharmas is based on five stages, namely the desire realm and the four fundamental meditations, because above those stages there are no collections of names, etc., and because they do not separately take as their object the names, etc., of lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c14_7']	詞無礙解唯依二地，謂依欲界、初本靜慮，上諸地中無尋伺故，彼地必無自語言故。	詞無礙解唯依二地，謂依欲界、初本靜慮，上諸地中無尋伺故，彼地必無自語言故。	076	The unobstructed understanding of words is based only on two stages, namely the desire realm and the first fundamental meditation, because above those stages there is no investigation and analysis, and because there are definitely no self-expressions in those stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c14_12']	此因非理。	此因非理。	076	This reason is unreasonable.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c14_17']	所以者何？	所以者何？	076	Why is it so?
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c16_5']	非發語智名無礙解，勿無礙解定中無故，由此不應作如是說。	非發語智名無礙解，勿無礙解定中無故，由此不應作如是說。	076	The knowledge that produces speech is not called unimpeded understanding, because it is not present in samādhi. Therefore you should not make such statements.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c17_4']	無尋伺故上地中無，無斯過失，因義異故。	無尋伺故上地中無，無斯過失，因義異故。	076	Because the meaning of the causes is different, there is no error in saying that it is absent in the upper stages because it is free of applied and sustained thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c17_9']	何謂因義？	何謂因義？	076	What is the meaning of the causes?
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c19_2']	謂此意言尋伺二法能發語故，相不寂靜自性麁動，上無此故寂靜微細。	謂此意言尋伺二法能發語故，相不寂靜自性麁動，上無此故寂靜微細。	076	It means that the two dharmas of applied and sustained thought in the manas produce speech, and their characteristics are not calm and their nature is coarse and agitated. The upper stages are free of these, and therefore they are calm and subtle.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c20_10']	詞無礙解緣外言詞，亦不寂靜麁動類攝，是故此解上地中無。	詞無礙解緣外言詞，亦不寂靜麁動類攝，是故此解上地中無。	076	Unimpeded understanding of elocution has as its object external elocution, which is also not calm and is categorized as coarse and agitated. Therefore this understanding is absent in the upper stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_076:0751c21_17']	初靜慮中亦有尋伺，故於定內亦有此解，由此極成但依二地。	初靜慮中亦有尋伺，故於定內亦有此解，由此極成但依二地。	076	Because applied and sustained thought exist in the first trance state, this understanding also exists within samādhi. Consequently, it is definitely established that it is supported by only two stages.

The support of the supernormal knowledge of the extinction of contamination is only the samādhi of cessation, because it is the most excellent. The supernormal knowledge of the extinction of contamination is also not supported by the formless realm, because all stages can eliminate contamination, because it does not depend on the contemplation of form as does the supernormal knowledge of the extinction of contamination.

Therefore, in the cultivation of the supernormal knowledge of the minds of others, form is the door. Therefore, in the cultivation of the supernormal knowledge of past existences, one gradually recollects the differences in states and only then attains fulfillment. This is because in the added efforts one necessarily contemplates form. Therefore, the formless realm does not have this ability.

They hold that sentient beings die and are annihilated. They see sentient beings born in the desire and form realms but do not know where they come from. They then hold that sentient beings did not exist previously but now exist.

But they may have been born in a higher realm, and not have died at the end of their life span. In this way, for eighty thousand eons they do not see where they are, and they think that they have died and been born in the sphere of neither conceptualization nor nonconceptualization.

Therefore, when the buddhas speak, it is not necessary that the transformed beings also speak. The sound, the words, and the meaning may be different.
