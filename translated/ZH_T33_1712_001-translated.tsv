['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a14_0']	夫以真源素範，冲漠隔於筌罤，妙覺玄猷，	夫以真源素範，冲漠隔於筌罤，妙覺玄猷，	The true source and original model are vast and distant from the realm of words and symbols, and the profound teaching of wondrous enlightenment
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a16_7']	奧頤超於言象，雖真俗雙泯，二諦恒存，空有兩亡，一味常顯。	奧頤超於言象，雖真俗雙泯，二諦恒存，空有兩亡，一味常顯。	Is deeply mysterious and transcends verbal expression and images. Although the two truths are both obliterated, the two truths always exist; emptiness and existence are both absent, and the single flavor is always revealed.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a17_18']	良以真空未甞不有，即有以辨於空，幻有未始不空，即空以明於有。	良以真空未甞不有，即有以辨於空，幻有未始不空，即空以明於有。	This is because true emptiness is never not existent, and existence is used to discern emptiness; illusory existence is never not empty, and emptiness is used to clarify existence.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a19_11']	有空有故不有，空有空故不空，不空之空空而非斷，不有之有有而不常；	有空有故不有，空有空故不空，不空之空空而非斷，不有之有有而不常；	Because existence is empty, it is not existent; because emptiness exists, it is not empty. Emptiness that is not empty is empty but not annihilated; existence that is not existent exists but is not permanent;
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a20_11']	四執既亡，百非斯遣，般若玄旨，斯之謂歟？	四執既亡，百非斯遣，般若玄旨，斯之謂歟？	Once the four attachments are gone, the hundred negations are dispelled. This is what is called the profound purport of prajñā?
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a23_2']	若歷事備陳，言過二十萬頌，若撮其樞要，理盡一十四行，是知詮真之教，乍廣略而隨緣，超言之宗，性圓通而俱現。	若歷事備陳，言過二十萬頌，若撮其樞要，理盡一十四行，是知詮真之教，乍廣略而隨緣，超言之宗，性圓通而俱現。	If one were to fully present the events, the words would exceed two hundred thousand verses. If one were to grasp its essential points, the principle is contained in fourteen lines. One should know that the teachings that expound the truth sometimes expand and sometimes abbreviate according to conditions. The essence of the teachings that transcend words is of perfect and unobstructed nature, manifesting simultaneously.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a24_14']	「般若心經」者，實謂曜昏衢之高炬，濟苦海之迅航，拯物導迷，莫斯最為。	「般若心經」者，實謂曜昏衢之高炬，濟苦海之迅航，拯物導迷，莫斯最為。	The Heart Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom is truly the bright torch that illuminates the dark path, the swift boat that crosses the ocean of suffering. In rescuing beings and guiding the deluded, none surpasses it.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a27_12']	然則「般若」以神鑒為體，「波羅蜜多」以到彼岸為功，「心」顯要妙所歸，「經」乃貫穿言教，從法就喻，詮旨為目，故言「般若波羅蜜多心經」。	然則「般若」以神鑒為體，「波羅蜜多」以到彼岸為功，「心」顯要妙所歸，「經」乃貫穿言教，從法就喻，詮旨為目，故言「般若波羅蜜多心經」。	Now, the Perfection of Wisdom takes spiritual insight as its essence, and crossing to the other shore as its function. Heart reveals the essential subtlety to which one returns. Sutra means to penetrate the spoken teachings. Taking the Dharma as the metaphor, the meaning is expressed as the title, thus it is called the Heart Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552a29_9']	將釋此經，五門分別，一、教興，二、藏攝，三、宗趣，四、釋題，五、解文。	將釋此經，五門分別，一、教興，二、藏攝，三、宗趣，四、釋題，五、解文。	In explaining this sutra, it is analyzed in five aspects: 1. The rise of the teaching, 2. The canon to which it belongs, 3. The purport and essence, 4. Explaining the title, 5. Explaining the text.

['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b11_2']	第二、藏攝者，謂三藏之中契經藏攝，二藏之內菩薩藏收，權實教中實教所攝。	第二、藏攝者，謂三藏之中契經藏攝，二藏之內菩薩藏收，權實教中實教所攝。	Second, in terms of the canon, it is included in the canon of sutras, and within the two canons it is included in the bodhisattva canon, and among the provisional and true teachings it is included in the true teaching.

However, first generally and then specifically, the three kinds of prajña are taken as the purport.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b13_10']	一、實相，謂所觀真性；	一、實相，謂所觀真性；	First, the true aspect, which refers to the true nature that is observed;

['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b17_4']	二、境、智一對，以真空境為宗，觀照智為趣；	二、境、智一對，以真空境為宗，觀照智為趣；	Second, the one pair of objects and wisdom, taking the true emptiness of objects as the purport and the wisdom of contemplation as the goal;
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b18_5']	三、因、果一對，以菩提因行為宗，菩提果德為趣。	三、因、果一對，以菩提因行為宗，菩提果德為趣。	Third, the one pair of causes and effects, taking the bodhisattva practices as causes as the purport and the merits and virtues of the bodhi effect as the goal.

['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b22_2']	「經」之一字是能詮之教，即能詮般若之經，依義立名。	「經」之一字是能詮之教，即能詮般若之經，依義立名。	The word sūtra is the teaching that can expound, namely the sūtra that can expound prajñā, named according to the meaning.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b25_4']	二、就所詮義中，法、喻分二，謂「般若」等是所詮之法，「心」之一字是所引之喻，即般若內統要衷之妙義，況人心藏為主、為要，統極之本。	二、就所詮義中，法、喻分二，謂「般若」等是所詮之法，「心」之一字是所引之喻，即般若內統要衷之妙義，況人心藏為主、為要，統極之本。	Second, within the expounded meaning, dividing into principle and analogy, prajñā and so forth are the principle to be expounded, and the word heart is the analogy to be drawn, namely the marvelous meaning that governs and is essential within prajñā, likened to the heart of a person that is the master and the essential, the fundamental extreme.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b27_1']	三、就前法中有體用分二，謂「般若」是體，此云智慧，即神悟玄奧、妙證真源也；	三、就前法中有體用分二，謂「般若」是體，此云智慧，即神悟玄奧、妙證真源也；	Third, within the previous principle, dividing into essence and function, prajñā is the essence, which means wisdom, namely the spiritual understanding of the profound and marvelous realization of the true source;
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552b29_8']	「波羅蜜多」是用，此云到彼岸，即由斯妙慧翻生死過盡，至真空之際，即簡不到彼岸之慧，故以為名。	「波羅蜜多」是用，此云到彼岸，即由斯妙慧翻生死過盡，至真空之際，即簡不到彼岸之慧，故以為名。	Pāramitā is the function, which means reaching the other shore. It is precisely by means of this wondrous wisdom that one turns away from the faults of birth and death and arrives at the realm of ultimate truth. It distinguishes from the wisdom that does not reach the other shore, and therefore it is used as the name.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552c01_9']	謂體即用故，法之喻故，義之教故，立斯名耳。	謂體即用故，法之喻故，義之教故，立斯名耳。	It means that the essence is precisely the function, the dharma is the analogy, and the meaning is the teaching. It is for these reasons that this name is established.

Avalokitêśvara Bodhisattva is the person who can contemplate. It means that in the realm of unobstructed principle and phenomena, contemplation and understanding are free, thus establishing this name.
['ZH_T33_1712_001:0552c15_7', 'ZH_T33_1712_001:0552c15_17']	又觀機往救，自在無閡，故以為名焉。🔽前釋就智，後釋就悲。	又觀機往救，自在無閡，故以為名焉。 前釋就智，後釋就悲。	Moreover, contemplating and rescuing according to capacity, freely and unobstructed, is why it is named.🔽The former explanation is based on wisdom, while the latter explanation is based on compassion.
