['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a05_9']	身境不定，大種造色俱為境故，所以後說。	身境不定，大種造色俱為境故，所以後說。	003	The object of the body consciousness is not fixed, because it can take either the four great elements or derivative form as its object, and therefore it is mentioned last.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a08_1']	或時身根唯取大種，或時身根唯取所造，或時身根俱取二種，是故身識，有說極多緣五觸起，謂四大種滑等隨一；	或時身根唯取大種，或時身根唯取所造，或時身根俱取二種，是故身識，有說極多緣五觸起，謂四大種滑等隨一；	003	Sometimes the body faculty only grasps the four great elements, sometimes it only grasps derivative form, and sometimes it grasps both. Therefore, some say that the most that body consciousness can be based on five contacts, namely, the four great elements and one of the smooth, etc.,

['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a12_9']	又眼用速，先遠見人撞擊鍾鼓後聞聲故。	又眼用速，先遠見人撞擊鍾鼓後聞聲故。	003	Also, the eye is faster, since one can see a person striking a bell or drum but not hear the sound.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a14_7']	鼻舌兩根用俱非遠，先說鼻者，由速明故，如對香美諸飲食時，鼻先嗅香舌後甞味。	鼻舌兩根用俱非遠，先說鼻者，由速明故，如對香美諸飲食時，鼻先嗅香舌後甞味。	003	The two faculties of nose and tongue are both not used for distant objects, but the nose is mentioned first because it is faster and clearer. When one encounters fragrant and delicious food, the nose first smells the fragrance and the tongue later tastes the flavor.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a15_6']	如是且約境定不定，用遠速明辯根次第。	如是且約境定不定，用遠速明辯根次第。	003	Thus, the order of the faculties is determined based on whether their objects are definite or indefinite, and whether their use is distant or fast and clear.

['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a17_18']	耳鼻舌根依處漸下，身處多下；	耳鼻舌根依處漸下，身處多下；	003	The locations of the ear, nose, and tongue faculties are gradually lower, and the body faculty is mostly lower.

['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a21_13']	理實應爾，然經主意，就根依處假說如此。	理實應爾，然經主意，就根依處假說如此。	003	This is indeed reasonable, but the main point of the sutra is to provisionally speak like this based on the locations of the faculties.

['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a26_13']	如本論言：	如本論言：	003	As the Abhidharma-śāstra says:
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a27_7']	色等五境，五識先受，意識後知。	色等五境，五識先受，意識後知。	003	The five sense objects such as form are first cognized by the five consciousnesses, and then known by the mental consciousness.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a28_5']	為自識依及取自境，應知俱是眼等功用。	為自識依及取自境，應知俱是眼等功用。	003	One should know that both being the support for their own consciousness and grasping their own objects are the functions of the eye, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786a29_4']	於五根中初二用遠，境不合故，所以先說。	於五根中初二用遠，境不合故，所以先說。	003	Among the five faculties, the first two have distant function, because their objects are not in contact. Therefore, they are mentioned first.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b01_3']	二中眼用復遠於耳，引事如前，是故先說。	二中眼用復遠於耳，引事如前，是故先說。	003	Among the two, the function of the eye is even more distant than that of the ear. The reason is as before. Therefore, it is mentioned first.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b02_2']	鼻等三用初二分明，故鼻居先，舌次身後。	鼻等三用初二分明，故鼻居先，舌次身後。	003	The function of the first two of the three, such as the nose, is clear. Therefore, the nose is mentioned first, followed by the tongue and body.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b03_1']	如鼻於香能取微細，舌於甘苦則不如是。	如鼻於香能取微細，舌於甘苦則不如是。	003	Just as the nose can grasp subtle smells, the tongue cannot do so with sweetness and bitterness.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b03_19']	如舌於味能取微細，身於冷煖則不如是。	如舌於味能取微細，身於冷煖則不如是。	003	Just as the tongue can perceive subtle tastes, the body cannot perceive cold and warmth in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b04_8']	隨處次第釋不異前。	隨處次第釋不異前。	003	The order of the sense bases is explained according to their location, just as before.

['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b08_0']	為差別最勝，　　攝多增上法，	為差別最勝，　　攝多增上法，	003	Because of distinction, supremacy, inclusion, and predominance of dharmas,
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b09_13']	故一處名色，　　一名為法處。	故一處名色，　　一名為法處。	003	One sense base is called form, and one is called the mental object sense base.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b10_2']	論曰：	論曰：	003	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b11_1']	雖十二處十色皆法，而為差別一立總名。	雖十二處十色皆法，而為差別一立總名。	003	Although the twelve sense bases and the ten forms are all mental objects, one is given a general name for the sake of distinction.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b11_11']	言差別者，謂各別處。	言差別者，謂各別處。	003	Distinction means each sense base.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b12_8']	若色法性等故名同，是則處名應二或一。	若色法性等故名同，是則處名應二或一。	003	If they are called the same because of the nature of form, then the sense bases should be either two or one.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b13_8']	諸弟子等，由此總名唯應總知，不了別相。	諸弟子等，由此總名唯應總知，不了別相。	003	The disciples would only understand the general name and not the specific characteristics.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b14_7']	為令了知境及有境種種差別，故立異名。	為令了知境及有境種種差別，故立異名。	003	The name is established in order to make one understand the various distinctions between objects and the possessor of objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b15_19']	由是如來於其聲等眼等色上立別義名，色處更無別義名故，總名即別。	由是如來於其聲等眼等色上立別義名，色處更無別義名故，總名即別。	003	Therefore, the Tathāgata established different names for sound, etc., and eye, etc., on the basis of form, because the name of the form realm has no other meaning, and the general name is the specific name.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b16_13']	如能作因諸立別名，為顯別義。	如能作因諸立別名，為顯別義。	003	Just as the name is established for the efficient cause in order to manifest the specific meaning.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b17_8']	此顯別義，故即別名，法處亦爾。	此顯別義，故即別名，法處亦爾。	003	This manifests the specific meaning, and therefore it is the specific name. The dharma realm is also like this.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b18_6']	言最勝者，由二因緣，唯色處中色相最勝：	言最勝者，由二因緣，唯色處中色相最勝：	003	As for the most excellent, for two reasons, only in the form realm is the form characteristic most excellent:
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b19_1']	一有見故，可示在此在彼差別；	一有見故，可示在此在彼差別；	003	First, because it can be seen, it can be shown as having distinctions of being here or there;
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b19_15']	二有對故，手等觸時即便變壞。	二有對故，手等觸時即便變壞。	003	Second, because it has resistance, when touched by the hand, etc., it immediately changes and is destroyed.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b20_12']	又多種故，三眼境故，世共於此立色名。	又多種故，三眼境故，世共於此立色名。	003	Also, because there are many kinds, and because it is the object of the three eyes, the world generally establishes the name form for it.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b21_12']	故諸大論師，非於聲等立色名故，唯一名色；	故諸大論師，非於聲等立色名故，唯一名色；	003	Therefore, the great śāstra masters do not establish the name form for sound, etc., and therefore there is only one name form;
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b22_11']	於法處中攝受想等眾多法故，應立通名。	於法處中攝受想等眾多法故，應立通名。	003	In the dharma realm, because it includes many dharmas such as conceptualization, etc., it should establish a general name.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b23_9']	若離通名，云何能攝多別相法同為一處？	若離通名，云何能攝多別相法同為一處？	003	If we leave aside the general name, how can we include many different dharmas in one place?
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b24_9']	又於此中攝多品類，法名諸法，故立法名。	又於此中攝多品類，法名諸法，故立法名。	003	Moreover, many categories are included here, and the name of dharmas is the dharmas of all dharmas, therefore the name of dharmas is established.
['ZH_T29_1563_003:0786b27_1']	謂擇法、覺支法、智法、隨念法、證淨法、念住法、無礙解法、寶法，歸此等法名有無量種，一切攝在此法處中，故獨名法。	謂擇法、覺支法、智法、隨念法、證淨法、念住法、無礙解法、寶法，歸此等法名有無量種，一切攝在此法處中，故獨名法。	003	Namely, the dharma of selecting dharmas, the dharma of the factors of enlightenment, the dharma of knowledge, the dharma of recollection, the dharma of the four reliances, the dharma of the four establishments of mindfulness, the dharma of the four unobstructed understandings, the dharma of the seven treasures, and the dharma of the three refuges. There are innumerable kinds of these dharmas, all included in this dharma realm, therefore it is uniquely called the dharma realm.

They say that the aggregates of dharmas are all included in the aggregate of mental activities, because names are by nature not associated with the mind.
