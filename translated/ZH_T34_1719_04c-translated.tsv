['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a22_0']	次菩薩中二：先總述意，次「又其意」下別出所	次菩薩中二：先總述意，次「又其意」下別出所	04c	Next, in the bodhisattvas, there are two parts: first, a general statement of the meaning; second, starting from Moreover, its meaning, it specifically brings out what is
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a23_0']	以。其意有三：初明無，次意或有或無，易故	以。其意有三：初明無，次意或有或無，易故	04c	meant. There are three meanings: First, it clarifies non-existence; second, the meaning is sometimes existent and sometimes non-existent, because it is easy to
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a25_2']	則無故云「處處有文」，準理合有故云「梵文」等也。	則無故云「處處有文」，準理合有故云「梵文」等也。	04c	understand, it is non-existent, therefore it says there are texts everywhere; according to principle, it should exist, therefore it says Brahma texts and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a26_14']	三明有中云「菩薩位行」等者，菩薩實位極至妙覺，仍異於別故名為深。	三明有中云「菩薩位行」等者，菩薩實位極至妙覺，仍異於別故名為深。	04c	Third, in the existence, it says the stages and practices of bodhisattvas and so on. The actual stage of bodhisattvas is ultimately up to the wondrous enlightenment, but it is still different from the separate [vehicle], therefore it is called deep.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a27_12']	新入實者猶非所及，故名為「絕」。	新入實者猶非所及，故名為「絕」。	04c	Those who newly enter the truth are still not able to reach it, therefore it is called cut off.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a28_3']	始從權來，故名為「新」。	始從權來，故名為「新」。	04c	Starting from the provisional [teachings], it is called new.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a28_14']	昔權位下故名為「小」。	昔權位下故名為「小」。	04c	The lower stages of the provisional [teachings] of the past are called small.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228a29_13']	「說壽量」等者，據理迹中具合有領，新小自不敢耳。	「說壽量」等者，據理迹中具合有領，新小自不敢耳。	04c	As for explaining the lifespan and so on, according to principle, in the traces [teaching] there should be both understanding and new small [vehicles], but they themselves do not dare.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b01_2']	故下總領頌云：	故下總領頌云：	04c	Therefore, the general understanding and praise below says:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b05_12']	「佛說希有法，昔所未曾聞，世尊有大力，壽命不可量，無數諸佛子，聞世尊分別，說得法利者」，乃至「或無礙樂說，餘有一生在」等，即是補處總為領解，八相易領故聲聞領之，法身記難非淺所領。	「佛說希有法，昔所未曾聞，世尊有大力，壽命不可量，無數諸佛子，聞世尊分別，說得法利者」，乃至「或無礙樂說，餘有一生在」等，即是補處總為領解，八相易領故聲聞領之，法身記難非淺所領。	04c	The Buddha speaks of rare dharmas, never heard before, the World-Honored One has great power, with immeasurable lifespan, countless Buddha's disciples, hearing the World-Honored One's distinctions, those who attain the benefits of the Dharma, up to or with unobstructed eloquence, with only one more birth remaining, and so on, this is the general understanding of the one who will be the next Buddha, because the eight aspects are easy to understand, the voice-hearers understand it, but the prediction of the Dharma body is difficult and not understood by the shallow.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b07_7']	言「更求何物云云」者，應更責問者，汝唯知聲聞別領，而不見菩薩通領耶？	言「更求何物云云」者，應更責問者，汝唯知聲聞別領，而不見菩薩通領耶？	04c	As for saying what else do they seek? and so on, one should further question, You only know the voice-hearers' individual understanding, but do you not see the bodhisattvas' general understanding?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b09_3']	故此三釋其義猶通，初意通指三教菩薩，通皆求佛，雖是權人執易轉故；	故此三釋其義猶通，初意通指三教菩薩，通皆求佛，雖是權人執易轉故；	04c	Therefore, these three explanations still have a general meaning. The first meaning generally refers to the bodhisattvas of the three teachings, all seeking Buddhahood. Although they are provisional people, their grasping is easily turned.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b11_8']	第二三意雖云處處有文，及小菩薩等，故應分別，小在三權、悟大語略，故注「云云」良由於此。	第二三意雖云處處有文，及小菩薩等，故應分別，小在三權、悟大語略，故注「云云」良由於此。	04c	The second three meanings, although it is said that there are texts everywhere, and small bodhisattvas, etc., therefore should be distinguished, the small are in the three provisional, and the understanding of the great is concise, therefore the annotation and so on is precisely due to this.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b13_8']	第七得記不得記者，亦是古計，先徵起，次正釋中緣覺如前入聲聞數，故但對菩薩亦為三。	第七得記不得記者，亦是古計，先徵起，次正釋中緣覺如前入聲聞數，故但對菩薩亦為三。	04c	The seventh, those who receive predictions and those who do not receive predictions, is also an ancient calculation. First, it raises the issue, and next, it correctly explains. The causes and conditions of pratyekabuddhas are the same as those of śrāvakas, therefore it only corresponds to bodhisattvas, which is also divided into three.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b15_12']	初文即具用向領解有無中初意，義兼第二，若同初二即同第三，即是初文並用前三義也。	初文即具用向領解有無中初意，義兼第二，若同初二即同第三，即是初文並用前三義也。	04c	The first text fully uses the first meaning in the previous understanding of acceptance and non-existence, and it also covers the second. If it is the same as the first two, it is the same as the third, which is the first text that uses all three meanings.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b16_2']	有記即有領解故也。	有記即有領解故也。	04c	There is a prediction because there is an understanding of acceptance.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b17_13']	言「如前云云」者，一者如前領解，第二中少梵文或有，但云「隨要」。	言「如前云云」者，一者如前領解，第二中少梵文或有，但云「隨要」。	04c	As for like the previous and so on, the first is like the previous understanding of acceptance. In the second, there is little Sanskrit text, or it just says according to the essentials.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b19_11']	第二意者義同前第三，但前文通、今具通別，龍女別，法師通，既彰灼記，何妨領解？	第二意者義同前第三，但前文通、今具通別，龍女別，法師通，既彰灼記，何妨領解？	04c	The second meaning is the same as the third in the previous text, but the previous text is general while this one is both general and specific. The dragon girl is specific, while the Dharma teachers are general. Since it is clearly recorded, how can it be prevented from being understood?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b20_15']	第三意者據近遠別，近非所欣、遠記亦在分別功德。	第三意者據近遠別，近非所欣、遠記亦在分別功德。	04c	The third meaning is based on the distinction between near and far. The near is not what is delighted in, while the far is also included in the distinction of merits.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b21_13']	言「壽量」者，重聞於〈壽量〉故得記也。	言「壽量」者，重聞於〈壽量〉故得記也。	04c	As for life span, it is because of hearing the life span again that one can receive the prediction.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b22_13']	望前第三但所對別，前對小菩薩、此小乘人。	望前第三但所對別，前對小菩薩、此小乘人。	04c	Compared with the previous third, it is only the distinction of the object. The previous one is for the small bodhisattvas, while this one is for the people of the Lesser Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b24_2']	次問意者，何不直云過若干劫得妙覺法身，但云初住八相？	次問意者，何不直云過若干劫得妙覺法身，但云初住八相？	04c	Next, the question is: Why not directly say that after so many kalpas one attains the wonderful Dharma body of enlightenment, but only say that one attains the eight characteristics of the initial stage?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b24_17']	此是一家教意正文，而人多不悟。	此是一家教意正文，而人多不悟。	04c	This is the main text of the teaching of a single school, yet many people do not understand it.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b25_2']	答意有二：	答意有二：	04c	The answer has two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b26_14']	一者明須八相，二者後與法身，以後形前知是初住，且橫指法身本也。	一者明須八相，二者後與法身，以後形前知是初住，且橫指法身本也。	04c	First, it clarifies the need for the eight characteristics. Second, it is given after the Dharma body. Since it is later than the previous, it is known to be the initial stage. It simply points horizontally to the original Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b28_3']	故知二乘兩處得益，且與八相記者，更令與物結淨土因。	故知二乘兩處得益，且與八相記者，更令與物結淨土因。	04c	Therefore, it is known that the two vehicles gained benefits in two places. As for the prediction of the eight aspects, it further causes them to establish the causes for the Pure Land with sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b29_7']	菩薩已於多劫利物隨熟隨脫，不假八相淺近之記；	菩薩已於多劫利物隨熟隨脫，不假八相淺近之記；	04c	Bodhisattvas have already benefited sentient beings for many kalpas, liberating them as they mature. They do not need the shallow prediction of the eight aspects.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228b29_17']	二乘不爾，是故須之。	二乘不爾，是故須之。	04c	The two vehicles are not like this, therefore they need it.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c01_16']	第八悟有淺深者，此無古師，於中又四：	第八悟有淺深者，此無古師，於中又四：	04c	The eighth, the understanding has shallow and deep levels, this has no ancient masters. Within it, there are four parts:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c02_12']	初略明所以，辨有淺深有明晦故。	初略明所以，辨有淺深有明晦故。	04c	First, briefly clarifying the reason, discerning that there are shallow and deep levels, there is brightness and obscurity.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c04_10']	次「初開」下釋淺深意，既云初聞法說已入佛慧，佛慧之語住中不專一品故也。	次「初開」下釋淺深意，既云初聞法說已入佛慧，佛慧之語住中不專一品故也。	04c	Next, below first opening, explaining the meaning of shallow and deep. Since it is said that hearing the Dharma explanation first has already entered the Buddha's wisdom, the phrase Buddha's wisdom is not exclusive to one chapter in the middle.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c05_14']	或唯初住，或二三四乃至十地，三節增進理實如然。	或唯初住，或二三四乃至十地，三節增進理實如然。	04c	Either only the initial abode, or the second, third, fourth, up to the tenth ground, the three sections of progress are indeed like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c07_6']	如釋惟忖中云先入今入，故今入之言該於四節，即三周壽量也。	如釋惟忖中云先入今入，故今入之言該於四節，即三周壽量也。	04c	As explained in the contemplation of the mind, it says first entering, now entering, therefore the phrase now entering encompasses the four sections, which are the three periods of the life span.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c08_8']	但先入者顯密不同，恐不了前意，故重云耳。	但先入者顯密不同，恐不了前意，故重云耳。	04c	But the earlier entry is different in exoteric and esoteric, fearing that the previous meaning is not understood, so it is mentioned again.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c10_13']	三「如聽」下舉凡況聖、舉麁況細，若再聞無益，初亦徒聞，四節加功理應增進，或至一生良由此也。	三「如聽」下舉凡況聖、舉麁況細，若再聞無益，初亦徒聞，四節加功理應增進，或至一生良由此也。	04c	Third, below like listening, it cites the ordinary to illustrate the sagely, and the coarse to illustrate the subtle. If listening again is useless, the first time was also in vain. If one adds effort in the four sections, the principle should be advanced, or even in one lifetime, it is due to this.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c11_11']	四「單複」下引事，如寒得衣重重漸勝。	四「單複」下引事，如寒得衣重重漸勝。	04c	Fourth, below single and complex, it cites examples, like the cold getting clothes, layer upon layer gradually surpassing.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c12_1']	「厚薄」者釋單複也。	「厚薄」者釋單複也。	04c	Thick and thin explains single and complex.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c12_3']	問：	問：	04c	Question:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c12_19']	若爾，何故前云此真位人無復淺深？	若爾，何故前云此真位人無復淺深？	04c	If so, why did it say earlier that a person in this true stage has no shallow or deep [understanding]?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c12_21']	答：	答：	04c	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c14_7']	一往同位實無淺深，細論明晦及明升入，既登後位理有增進。	一往同位實無淺深，細論明晦及明升入，既登後位理有增進。	04c	Broadly speaking, the same stage indeed has no shallow or deep [understanding], but in detail, there is brightness and obscurity, and the bright one advances. Having ascended to the later stage, the principle has advancement.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c15_1']	第九明權實得益者，為六：	第九明權實得益者，為六：	04c	The ninth, clarifying the benefits obtained by the provisional and the real, has six parts:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c16_6']	初出舊解，言「一云」者，舊應多釋，其一違文故且云一。	初出舊解，言「一云」者，舊應多釋，其一違文故且云一。	04c	First, presenting the old explanations, saying one says means the old should have many explanations, but one contradicts the text, so it is simply called one.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c16_15']	次「今明」下正釋。	次「今明」下正釋。	04c	Next, below now clarifying, it is the correct explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c17_15']	言「隣圓」者，「圓」謂圓滿，近於滿位隣妙覺也。	言「隣圓」者，「圓」謂圓滿，近於滿位隣妙覺也。	04c	As for neighboring the perfect, perfect means complete, close to the state of completion, neighboring the wondrous enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c18_6']	言「際極」者，顯隣圓耳。	言「際極」者，顯隣圓耳。	04c	As for reaching the extreme, it only shows neighboring the perfect.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c18_18']	三「所以」下明得益由國。	三「所以」下明得益由國。	04c	Third, below Therefore it clarifies that the benefit is due to the country.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c19_3']	「文云」下引證。	「文云」下引證。	04c	Below The text says it cites evidence.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c20_16']	言「化功」者，影響迹時已有化益，前後增道即是深利，權人處處得益深故。	言「化功」者，影響迹時已有化益，前後增道即是深利，權人處處得益深故。	04c	As for the merit of transformation, the traces of the responsive and transformative have already benefited, the deepening of the path before and after is precisely the profound benefit, because the provisional people benefit deeply everywhere.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c22_2']	五「故一音」下立理，不必併須待至〈壽量〉，故云「一音」。	五「故一音」下立理，不必併須待至〈壽量〉，故云「一音」。	04c	Fifth, below Therefore, the one sound it establishes the principle, not necessarily all waiting until the chapter on Lifespan, therefore it says one sound.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c23_8']	又密益者宜聞長遠，時處不同顯密各異，故注「云云」。	又密益者宜聞長遠，時處不同顯密各異，故注「云云」。	04c	Moreover, the secret benefit is suitable to hear the long and distant, the time and place are different, the manifest and secret are each different, therefore the commentary says and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c24_11']	六「又我」下正證影響得益之文，若於己無益何謂欲得？	六「又我」下正證影響得益之文，若於己無益何謂欲得？	04c	Sixth, below Moreover, I it directly proves the text of the responsive and transformative obtaining benefit. If there is no benefit for oneself, what is meant by wanting to obtain?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c26_6']	第十明待時不待時者，初正釋中先大判，次「若就」下就三周及本委論待等。	第十明待時不待時者，初正釋中先大判，次「若就」下就三周及本委論待等。	04c	Tenth, clarifying whether it waits for the time or not. In the initial correct explanation, it is first broadly divided, and then below If it is based on, it specifically discusses waiting and so forth based on the three periods and the original.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c28_10']	三周之中自論密者，如法說時密聞大車及大通事而得益者，即不待時，中周密聞準說可見。	三周之中自論密者，如法說時密聞大車及大通事而得益者，即不待時，中周密聞準說可見。	04c	In the three periods, it discusses the secret by itself. For example, when the Dharma was being explained, those who secretly heard about the great vehicle and the matter of Great Brightness attained benefits, then it does not wait for the time. The secret hearing in the middle period can be seen based on the explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c28_12']	問：	問：	04c	Question:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c29_15']	三周及本有密說者，《玄》文那云「法華唯顯」？	三周及本有密說者，《玄》文那云「法華唯顯」？	04c	In the three periods and the original, there is secret explanation. Why does the Profound Text say The Lotus Sūtra is only manifest?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0228c29_17']	答：	答：	04c	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a04_12']	言顯密者，爾前遍圓互不相知，今至此經同入一圓，雖密而顯純一味故，但於一座有待不待，但知彰灼授記二乘，顯露分明說長遠壽，於茲一座無不聞知，故名為顯。	言顯密者，爾前遍圓互不相知，今至此經同入一圓，雖密而顯純一味故，但於一座有待不待，但知彰灼授記二乘，顯露分明說長遠壽，於茲一座無不聞知，故名為顯。	04c	As for the manifest and secret, before this, the universal and perfect [teachings] did not mutually know each other. Now, having reached this sūtra, they equally enter the one perfect [teaching]. Although it is secret, it is purely one flavor, therefore, there is only waiting and not waiting at one seat. Only knowing the clearly revealed prediction of the two vehicles, and the clearly revealed explanation of the long distant life, at this one seat there is none who does not hear and know it, therefore it is called manifest.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a06_16']	問云「非顯非密」者，謂決定性，於前四時既無密益，不至法華復無顯得，二處無益名失時不？	問云「非顯非密」者，謂決定性，於前四時既無密益，不至法華復無顯得，二處無益名失時不？	04c	Question: As for neither revealed nor secret, this refers to the undetermined nature. Since there is no secret benefit in the previous four periods, and they do not reach the Lotus Sutra to receive the revealed benefit, are they said to have missed the opportunity and not benefited in both places?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a09_16']	答「餘經」等者，謂前四時既云永滅，諸聲聞等不知變易，故《淨名》中迦葉自敘云「皆應號泣聲震三千，於此大乘已如敗種」。	答「餘經」等者，謂前四時既云永滅，諸聲聞等不知變易，故《淨名》中迦葉自敘云「皆應號泣聲震三千，於此大乘已如敗種」。	04c	Answer: Other sutras and so forth. This means that since the previous four periods are said to be eternally extinguished, the śrāvakas and others do not know about the transformation and change. Therefore, in the Vimalakīrti Sutra, Kāśyapa recounts, We should all weep with voices shaking the three thousand worlds. In this great vehicle, we are like seeds that have failed.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a10_15']	準彼經判，敗種豈生來至法華咸受佛記？	準彼經判，敗種豈生來至法華咸受佛記？	04c	According to that sutra, how can failed seeds be reborn to reach the Lotus Sutra and all receive the Buddha's predictions?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a13_14']	若爾，佛於爾時何不即記，而使稽滯來至法華，顯密不同如前已釋，若將永滅權論用釋開會實經，經既已生，論何能滅？	若爾，佛於爾時何不即記，而使稽滯來至法華，顯密不同如前已釋，若將永滅權論用釋開會實經，經既已生，論何能滅？	04c	If so, why did the Buddha not predict them at that time, but let them linger until the Lotus Sutra? The differences between the revealed and secret teachings have already been explained above. If using the eternally extinguished provisional teachings to explain the sutra of the real teaching of opening and revealing, since the sutra has already been born, how can the treatise extinguish it?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a14_13']	但以滅者於彼得聞，餘經不說，況通經論？	但以滅者於彼得聞，餘經不說，況通經論？	04c	It is only because those who are extinguished can hear it there, but it is not explained in other sutras, let alone in sutras and treatises in common?
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a16_4']	故失顯密亦非失時，但弘教者曲將釋此，是釋者過非論咎也。	故失顯密亦非失時，但弘教者曲將釋此，是釋者過非論咎也。	04c	Therefore, the loss of exoteric and esoteric [teachings] is also not a loss of opportunity. It is just that the propagators of the teachings have twistedly explained this. This is the fault of the expounders, not the fault of the treatise.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a18_2']	「五千起去」等者，無四時之密益，失此會之顯功，此化失時彼土非冀，故應失時。	「五千起去」等者，無四時之密益，失此會之顯功，此化失時彼土非冀，故應失時。	04c	As for five thousand people leaving and so on, they have no secret benefits of the four periods, and they lose the manifest merits of this assembly. This teaching loses its opportunity, and that land is not hoped for, so it should lose its opportunity.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a18_5']	答云：	答云：	04c	The answer is:
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a18_12']	滅後益者是也。	滅後益者是也。	04c	The benefit after extinction is it.
['ZH_T34_1719_04c:0229a18_14']	問：	問：	04c	Question:

The others who were not yet enlightened still universally invited. Since they universally invited and universally spoke, how can it be said that the Buddha spoke for each of them?

At the beginning of the chapter on parables, it is universally for the middle and lower capacities, and therefore the heavenly beings understand.

The capacities of beings are autonomous. Those of medium and lower capacities were still unclear, so it was repeated for those of medium and lower capacities. The Buddha also universally explained for those of medium and lower capacities in the parable, so among the 1,200 disciples, those of the lowest capacity were outside the four [disciples]. Therefore, the Buddha discerned their capacities and did not need to request again. He then immediately agreed, saying I will now explain the causes and conditions from the past.

As in the parable, the great vehicle compared to the small vehicle is also appropriate. As in the teaching of the Dharma, compared to the three vehicles it is the past, and the one vehicle is also the present.

The first sentence is Śāriputra's narration of the 1,200 not knowing. I now... below, at the beginning of the doctrinal explanation, he narrates his own lack of knowledge.

One should know that it is just in contrast to the time of hearing the Buddha's speech that it is said that they did not know.

Those who are confused are both called not understanding. If one understands the meaning of the transformation, then both are called understanding. In the past, it was necessary to say that they did not form attachments, but from the perspective of the present, it becomes a fault.

This is because the opening and not opening of the teachings of the Great and Small Vehicles are all common to the three periods of time.

If one is confused about the real and adheres to the provisional, the fault is not small. If one forgets the provisional and adheres to the real, the transgression is still slight. Since one is expounding the true teaching, one must say that it is definitely accomplished. People do not see this and vainly cite the provisional canon to prove the true teaching.

First, harmonization. Although there are two beginnings, the great beginning is for determination. How can one take the small attachment to the small extinction as a standard from the middle?

Knowing that the Buddha appears in the world, there are still those who come down from the heavens to draw near the Buddha and so forth. If it is the one going upstream, even if they reach the formless realm or attain parinirvāṇa in the formless realm, there are still those who manifest in the desire realm and come to see the Buddha. If they do not see the Buddha, it is also possible that at the time of the remaining parinirvāṇa, they are also called pratyekabuddhas. Therefore, it says the two fruits and three fruits are the same.

These people, in the past, under the Buddhas of the Ganges sands, practiced the six perfections but gave rise to attached thoughts, had repentant minds, and had retrogressed. They will have to undergo hardships again and again. Even after a thousand Buddhas have passed, they still have not attained liberation. Although these people cultivate the bodhisattva path, they will never be able to attain Buddhahood, just like a person who wants to build a house in the sky, which is ultimately impossible.

If one hears the three bodies, one will give rise to slander. In the vehicle of the Shared, the meaning of slander is less. Therefore, one should know that even if a person now wants to give rise to the aspiration, if they do not distinguish between the limited and the perfect and do not understand the realm of vows, how can they avoid slander when hearing the Dharma in the future?

Now it is also temporarily based on the end of the gradual teachings and the beginning of the small vehicle to explain now the buddhas to selecting and sending away.
