['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b19_0']	五約譬中二：初敘傍正意，次正明用譬。	五約譬中二：初敘傍正意，次正明用譬。	In the fifth section on using parables, there are two parts: first, introducing the main and secondary meanings; second, correctly explaining the use of parables.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b21_8']	初言「兼明」等者，三獸二珠約開合為喻，黃石中金約破會為譬；	初言「兼明」等者，三獸二珠約開合為喻，黃石中金約破會為譬；	The first part, also clarifying, etc., uses the three animals and two pearls as parables for opening and closing, and the gold in the yellow stone as a parable for breaking and gathering;
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b22_1']	雖此二意，正為顯體。	雖此二意，正為顯體。	although there are these two meanings, the main purpose is to reveal the essence.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b22_9']	次正明用譬中二：	次正明用譬中二：	In the second part, correctly explaining the use of parables, there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b23_6']	先正釋三譬，次「引此」下明用三譬意。	先正釋三譬，次「引此」下明用三譬意。	first, correctly explaining the three parables; second, explaining the meaning of using the three parables below drawing this.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b24_3']	初釋中文自為三，初借三獸中三：	初釋中文自為三，初借三獸中三：	In the first explanation, there are three parts, the first borrowing the three animals, there are three:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b25_2']	初正釋，次「如是」下示體，三「此約」下結示。	初正釋，次「如是」下示體，三「此約」下結示。	first, correctly explaining; second, showing the essence below like this; third, concluding and showing below this is about.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b25_7']	初文又二：	初文又二：	The first text has two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b26_16']	初三獸之譬本譬於通，通真諦中有空有中，取象不空為今經體。	初三獸之譬本譬於通，通真諦中有空有中，取象不空為今經體。	First, the parable of the three animals originally illustrates the common, the true reality within the common has emptiness, existence, and the middle, taking the non-empty as the essence of the present sūtra.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b28_11']	次從「到又二種」去亦約教道重簡，但中仍為小象，圓教不空方名大象。	次從「到又二種」去亦約教道重簡，但中仍為小象，圓教不空方名大象。	Next, from There are also two kinds onwards, it again distinguishes based on the path of teaching, but the middle is still considered a small elephant, and only the non-empty of the perfect teaching is called a great elephant.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934b29_15']	次「如是」下示於圓中異於通別，正顯今經不思議體。	次「如是」下示於圓中異於通別，正顯今經不思議體。	Next, below Thus, it shows that within the perfect, it is different from the common and distinct, and correctly reveals the inconceivable essence of the present sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c05_11']	三從「此約」下結譬本意，本借三獸以譬通教，故重結云「約共真諦」，真諦既含一真二中，是故須簡偏真但中非今經體，此約圓別入通以簡經體，故知他人解釋尚不識小象不空，況能辨於大象不空？	三從「此約」下結譬本意，本借三獸以譬通教，故重結云「約共真諦」，真諦既含一真二中，是故須簡偏真但中非今經體，此約圓別入通以簡經體，故知他人解釋尚不識小象不空，況能辨於大象不空？	Third, from This is based on onwards, it concludes the original intention of the parable. The original borrowing of the three beasts is used to illustrate the common truth, and therefore it is repeatedly concluded that it is based on the common true reality. Since the true reality includes the one true reality and the two middles, it is necessary to distinguish the biased true reality and the mere middle, which are not the essence of the present sutra. This is based on the perfect and distinct entering the common to distinguish the essence of the sutra. Therefore, it should be known that others' explanations do not even recognize the non-empty of the small elephant, let alone be able to discern the non-empty of the great elephant?
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c06_5']	況能知於二中合在真諦中耶？	況能知於二中合在真諦中耶？	Let alone being able to know that the two middles are combined within the true reality?
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c06_14']	但知大象一概大乘。	但知大象一概大乘。	They only know that the great elephant is universally the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c07_7']	次更借二珠譬者，又二：	次更借二珠譬者，又二：	Next, the borrowing of the two jewels as a metaphor is also twofold:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c08_4']	先正約二珠，次復獨約一如意珠譬。	先正約二珠，次復獨約一如意珠譬。	First, it correctly uses the two jewels, and next, it exclusively uses the metaphor of the one wish-fulfilling jewel.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c08_9']	初文又二：	初文又二：	The first part is further divided into two:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c08_19']	初正釋，次結示經體。	初正釋，次結示經體。	The first is the correct explanation, and the second is the conclusion showing the essence of the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c12_2']	初云不能雨寶名為但空，能雨寶者名一切法空，空含二義是故須簡，空名不殊故云「相似」，但空唯空故云「但空」，此是通教偏真但空。	初云不能雨寶名為但空，能雨寶者名一切法空，空含二義是故須簡，空名不殊故云「相似」，但空唯空故云「但空」，此是通教偏真但空。	The first says that not being able to rain treasures is called emptiness, and being able to rain treasures is called the emptiness of all dharmas. Emptiness contains two meanings, so it must be distinguished. The name emptiness is not different, so it is said to be similar. But emptiness is only empty, so it is called but emptiness. This is the emptiness of the common teaching's biased truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c13_19']	對別教俗諦中空不具諸法，故云「但空不能雨寶」，亦空亦雨即是即中即假故也。	對別教俗諦中空不具諸法，故云「但空不能雨寶」，亦空亦雨即是即中即假故也。	Opposed to the emptiness in the conventional truth of the separate teaching, which does not possess all dharmas, it is called but emptiness, unable to rain treasures. Both emptiness and raining are precisely the middle and the provisional, therefore.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c16_12']	但空非空教道權說，故以能雨正譬實中，此是圓教入別之說，別教有無共為俗諦，圓入即以兩中為真，是故真中。	但空非空教道權說，故以能雨正譬實中，此是圓教入別之說，別教有無共為俗諦，圓入即以兩中為真，是故真中。	But emptiness is not emptiness, the provisional teaching is said to be able. Therefore, being able to rain is used to correctly illustrate the reality of the middle. This is the teaching of entering the separate in the perfect teaching. The separate teaching takes existence and non-existence together as the conventional truth. The perfect entry takes both middles as the truth. Therefore, in the truth,
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c17_17']	簡却但中非今經體，是故重喻如意摩尼，以辨得失。	簡却但中非今經體，是故重喻如意摩尼，以辨得失。	The mere middle is excluded, not the essence of this sutra. Therefore, the analogy of the wish-fulfilling mani is used to distinguish gain and loss.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c19_7']	是則前三獸喻約別圓入通，故須於其能入之中簡却次第中也。	是則前三獸喻約別圓入通，故須於其能入之中簡却次第中也。	This then is the previous three animal analogies, which are about entering the Shared from the Distinct and the Perfect, and therefore must be distinguished within the ability to enter, excluding the gradual.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c20_6']	約能所合說，故云空中合為真諦簡也。	約能所合說，故云空中合為真諦簡也。	Speaking of the ability and the object together, it is said that emptiness and existence combined are the truth of ultimate truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c21_17']	今亦如是，約所入邊即別教中道，但簡所入能入盡妙，正是經體。	今亦如是，約所入邊即別教中道，但簡所入能入盡妙，正是經體。	Now it is also like this, speaking of the object of entry, it is the middle way of the Distinct Teaching, but only distinguishing the object of entry, the ability to enter is all wonderful, which is precisely the essence of the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c23_7']	今亦能所合論，所入仍語俗者為辨異前，故云有無合為俗簡。	今亦能所合論，所入仍語俗者為辨異前，故云有無合為俗簡。	Now speaking of the ability and the object together, still speaking of existence as the object of entry is to distinguish it from the previous, and therefore it is said that existence and nonexistence combined are the truth of conventional existence.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c24_5']	次更約如意為譬，亦二，先釋，次結。	次更約如意為譬，亦二，先釋，次結。	Next, using the analogy of a wish-fulfilling jewel, there are also two parts: first explaining, then concluding.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c25_10']	釋中亦是如意名同，如二空名同，故云含中真諦簡也。	釋中亦是如意名同，如二空名同，故云含中真諦簡也。	In the explanation, it is also a wish-fulfilling jewel with the same name, like the two emptinesses having the same name, and therefore it is said that it contains the middle truth.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c26_6']	與前二象大意不殊，今重顯耳。	與前二象大意不殊，今重顯耳。	The general meaning is no different from the previous two elephants, but it is now being restated.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c27_5']	向借二喻，並約教道，故分二象及以二珠；	向借二喻，並約教道，故分二象及以二珠；	The previous two analogies are both about the path of teaching, and therefore the two elephants and the two jewels are distinguished;
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c28_6']	此中約理，理本無二，由機緣取，致有真中。	此中約理，理本無二，由機緣取，致有真中。	Here, in terms of principle, principle is originally non-dual, but due to the reception of the faculties and conditions, there are true and middle [realms].
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0934c29_5']	故知真中本同一實，故喻如意珠體不殊。	故知真中本同一實，故喻如意珠體不殊。	Therefore, know that the true and middle are originally one reality, so the analogy is like the essence of the wish-fulfilling jewel which is not different.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a01_14']	此重約前別圓入通，真諦之中含二中者，人有得失，非理爾也。	此重約前別圓入通，真諦之中含二中者，人有得失，非理爾也。	This again discusses the entry into the common from the distinct and perfect, and the middle of the true realm contains the two middles. People have gains and losses, but it is not so for the principle.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a02_14']	雖復重約如意為譬，同成第二珠譬義耳。	雖復重約如意為譬，同成第二珠譬義耳。	Although it again discusses the wish-fulfilling jewel as an analogy, it is the same as forming the second analogy of the wish-fulfilling jewel.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a03_19']	第三譬者，教理共論，是故通約一切凡聖及以教法。	第三譬者，教理共論，是故通約一切凡聖及以教法。	The third analogy discusses the teachings and principles together, and therefore generally discusses all ordinary beings, sages, and the teachings.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a04_4']	於中為二：	於中為二：	Within this, there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a04_14']	初約機異，次判同異。	初約機異，次判同異。	First, discussing the differences in faculties, next, distinguishing the similarities and differences.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a05_1']	初機異又三：	初機異又三：	The first discussion of differences in faculties has three parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a05_13']	初譬，次合，三結示經體。	初譬，次合，三結示經體。	First, the analogy, next, the correspondence, third, concluding by demonstrating the essence of the sutra.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a07_3']	此四人中第二含於兩教二乘及通菩薩，三藏菩薩亦同凡夫故也。	此四人中第二含於兩教二乘及通菩薩，三藏菩薩亦同凡夫故也。	Among these four people, the second one includes the two vehicles of the two teachings and the bodhisattvas of the common teaching, because the bodhisattvas of the three vehicles are also the same as ordinary beings.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a07_8']	次文中二：	次文中二：	Next, in the text, there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a07_15']	先判，次結意。	先判，次結意。	First, the distinction, next, concluding the meaning.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a08_15']	言「與奪破會」者，金體不殊，故云「與」也。	言「與奪破會」者，金體不殊，故云「與」也。	As for giving and taking away, breaking and unifying, the essence of gold is no different, so it is called giving.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a09_19']	凡夫其實未得果理，與而言之，云理不二，是故云「與」。	凡夫其實未得果理，與而言之，云理不二，是故云「與」。	Ordinary beings in reality have not yet attained the principle of fruition, but in terms of giving, it is said that the principle is non-dual, so it is called giving.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a10_18']	理雖不二，凡實未有果上之用，是故云「奪」。	理雖不二，凡實未有果上之用，是故云「奪」。	Although the principle is non-dual, ordinary beings in reality do not yet have the function of fruition, so it is called taking away.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a11_7', 'ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a12_8']	估客金匠，準此說之。🔽所言「破」者，若廢權立實，丹尚異器，何況金石？	估客金匠，準此說之。 所言「破」者，若廢權立實，丹尚異器，何況金石？	The merchant and the goldsmith are explained based on this.🔽As for breaking, if the provisional is abandoned and the real is established, the bronze is still different from the vessel, let alone gold and stone.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a13_6']	若會權歸實，體既不殊，豈簡金石？	若會權歸實，體既不殊，豈簡金石？	If the provisional is unified and returns to the real, since the essence is no different, how can it distinguish gold and stone?
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a13_16']	凡夫亦然，準說可見。	凡夫亦然，準說可見。	Ordinary beings are also like this, the explanation can be seen based on this.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a14_5']	次明用譬意中又三：	次明用譬意中又三：	Next, clarifying the meaning of using the analogy, there are three parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a15_15']	初正明三意，次「今明」下結成三法，三「如此」下結成一乘三軌。	初正明三意，次「今明」下結成三法，三「如此」下結成一乘三軌。	First, directly clarifying the three meanings; next, below Now, it is explained, concluding the three dharmas; third, below Like this, concluding the one vehicle and three tracks.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a15_20']	初文中三：	初文中三：	In the first text, there are three parts:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a17_6']	初意云「約根性」等者，二乘淺、菩薩深，其利根者又得其中。	初意云「約根性」等者，二乘淺、菩薩深，其利根者又得其中。	The initial meaning says based on the capacities of sentient beings and so on, with the two vehicles being shallow and bodhisattvas being deep, and those with sharp faculties again being in between.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a18_15']	次言「三情」者，亦約三人，三情各別，故初人從假入空但求出苦；	次言「三情」者，亦約三人，三情各別，故初人從假入空但求出苦；	Next, it says three emotions, which is also based on three people, with the three emotions each being different, so the first person, from the provisional entering emptiness, only seeks to leave suffering;
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a19_5']	次別人地前歷別；	次別人地前歷別；	Next, the individual stage before the ground is sequential;
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a20_10']	後人方能於別但中見一切法中，故云「後者廣大」。	後人方能於別但中見一切法中，故云「後者廣大」。	The last person is only able to see all dharmas in the provisional and middle, therefore it says the last is vast.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a21_6']	後喻三方便者，凡夫全無，置而不說。	後喻三方便者，凡夫全無，置而不說。	The last metaphor of the three skillful means, ordinary beings do not have them at all, so they are not discussed.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a21_15']	次結成三法中，問：	次結成三法中，問：	In the conclusion of the three dharmas, it is asked:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a23_9']	前三譬中皆云今經體也，又復三義本為顯體，何得此中乃云三譬以對三法？	前三譬中皆云今經體也，又復三義本為顯體，何得此中乃云三譬以對三法？	In the previous three parables, it is said that they are the essence of the present sūtra, and moreover, the three meanings are originally to reveal the essence. How can it be said here that the three parables correspond to the three dharmas?
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a23_11']	答：	答：	The answer:
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a24_6']	義有傍正，正顯體已復順此三。	義有傍正，正顯體已復順此三。	The meaning has secondary and primary. After directly revealing the essence, it again accords with these three.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a26_2']	若爾即是用所依體，體能成用，亦宗所顯體，體能成宗，故以三譬，復對三法。	若爾即是用所依體，體能成用，亦宗所顯體，體能成宗，故以三譬，復對三法。	If so, then it is using the substance of the basis. The substance can accomplish the function, and also the substance that is manifested by the thesis can accomplish the thesis. Therefore, the three metaphors correspond to the three dharmas.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935a28_17']	第三意中云「如此三譬即是三德」者，象譬法身以得底故，珠譬解脫以能雨故，仙譬般若住妙空故，此約別說故作此對。	第三意中云「如此三譬即是三德」者，象譬法身以得底故，珠譬解脫以能雨故，仙譬般若住妙空故，此約別說故作此對。	In the third meaning, it says these three metaphors are precisely the three virtues. The elephant metaphor is the Dharma body because it reaches the bottom. The pearl metaphor is liberation because it can rain. The immortal metaphor is prajñā because it abides in the wondrous emptiness. This is a separate explanation, so this correspondence is made.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b01_10', 'ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b02_7']	若一一譬各為三者，「得堅」譬法身，「以水」譬般若，「至岸」譬解脫；🔽珠體譬法身，珠空譬般若，雨寶譬解脫；	若一一譬各為三者，「得堅」譬法身，「以水」譬般若，「至岸」譬解脫； 珠體譬法身，珠空譬般若，雨寶譬解脫；	If each metaphor has three, obtaining firmness is a metaphor for the Dharma body, using water is a metaphor for prajñā, and reaching the other shore is a metaphor for liberation;🔽the substance of the pearl is a metaphor for the Dharma body, the emptiness of the pearl is a metaphor for prajñā, and raining treasures is a metaphor for liberation;
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b03_7']	「脩治」譬般若，「金體」譬法身，「成仙」譬解脫。	「脩治」譬般若，「金體」譬法身，「成仙」譬解脫。	cultivating and polishing is a metaphor for prajñā, the substance of gold is a metaphor for the Dharma body, and becoming an immortal is a metaphor for liberation.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b05_12']	皆取法身以為經體，恐體濫故，故約三德簡出二德剋取法身，若據顯體，亦秖應是法身德耳。	皆取法身以為經體，恐體濫故，故約三德簡出二德剋取法身，若據顯體，亦秖應是法身德耳。	All take the Dharma body as the essence of the sūtra, fearing that the essence may be confused, therefore, it distinguishes the two virtues based on the three virtues and takes the Dharma body as the essence. If based on revealing the essence, it should only be the virtue of the Dharma body.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b06_8']	今言三德，意亦如前，思之可見。	今言三德，意亦如前，思之可見。	Now, the three virtues are also as explained above, one can see it by thinking about it.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b09_17']	約悟簡者，所以須此悟簡者，如釋十妙自有從因至果自行化他，故不須論悟，尚一一文下皆須觀心，及至釋經亦立觀心一門，經是教法故也。	約悟簡者，所以須此悟簡者，如釋十妙自有從因至果自行化他，故不須論悟，尚一一文下皆須觀心，及至釋經亦立觀心一門，經是教法故也。	The reason why this understanding needs to be distinguished is that in explaining the ten marvels, there is already going from the cause to the fruition, self-practice, and benefiting others, therefore, it does not need to discuss understanding. Each and every text still needs to contemplate the mind, and when explaining the sūtra, it also establishes the one gate of contemplating the mind, because the sūtra is the teaching Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b11_4']	今明體中須約悟者，體通凡鄙，其名猶通是故須簡。	今明體中須約悟者，體通凡鄙，其名猶通是故須簡。	Now, explaining the essence needs to be based on understanding, because the essence is common to the vulgar, its name is still common, therefore, it needs to be distinguished.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b12_15']	下文明用，用是果上之法，宗是因果，不悟無果，故並不須約悟簡也。	下文明用，用是果上之法，宗是因果，不悟無果，故並不須約悟簡也。	The explanation below clarifies the function, the function is the Dharma above the fruition, the purport is the cause and effect, without understanding there is no fruition, therefore, they do not all need to be distinguished based on understanding.
['ZH_T33_1717_017:0935b13_5']	是故約悟唯在此中。	是故約悟唯在此中。	Therefore, distinguishing based on understanding is only in this section.
