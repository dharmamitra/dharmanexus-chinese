['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a06_8']	此品名目未應在此。	此品名目未應在此。	004	The title of this chapter should not be here.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a06_13']	何以知之？	何以知之？	004	How do we know this?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a08_17']	譬喻之意本為中根人譬說開三顯一，但法說開三顯一化上根人猶自未竟，云何已是譬喻說耶？	譬喻之意本為中根人譬說開三顯一，但法說開三顯一化上根人猶自未竟，云何已是譬喻說耶？	004	The meaning of the parables is originally to use parables to explain the revealing of the One in the three for those of middling faculties. However, the explanation of the revealing of the One in the three in the teaching for those of superior faculties is not yet finished, so how can this already be the parable explanation?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a11_11']	所以題品在中者，蓋是出經者分卷令調，故割法說之餘安置此中，不欲令卷有大小，是故移譬喻品名置第二卷初。	所以題品在中者，蓋是出經者分卷令調，故割法說之餘安置此中，不欲令卷有大小，是故移譬喻品名置第二卷初。	004	The reason the chapter title is in the middle is that the compiler of the sutra divided the scrolls to make them balanced, so he cut out the remainder of the teaching and placed it here, not wanting the scrolls to be too large or too small. Therefore, he moved the title of the Parable Chapter to the beginning of the second scroll.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a13_9']	若實論品處，正從「舍利弗白佛言，世尊我今無復疑悔」以下，此處方是〈譬喻品〉也。	若實論品處，正從「舍利弗白佛言，世尊我今無復疑悔」以下，此處方是〈譬喻品〉也。	004	If we discuss the location of the chapter based on the actual text, it should start from Śāriputra said to the Buddha, 'World-Honored One, I now have no more doubts or regrets,' which is where the Parable Chapter actually begins.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a14_14']	若用此法說四段准下譬說化中根人四段者，亦應具四品：	若用此法說四段准下譬說化中根人四段者，亦應具四品：	004	If we use the four sections of the teaching to correspond to the four sections of the parable explanation for transforming those of middling faculties below, there should also be four chapters:
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a16_7', 'ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a17_13', 'ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a18_20']	第一正法說之處即應言法說品，無異下化中根人中〈譬喻品〉也。🔽若是領解段即應言領解品，無異下化中根人〈信解品〉也。🔽若是述誠段即應言述誠品，無異下化中根人有〈藥草品〉也。	第一正法說之處即應言法說品，無異下化中根人中〈譬喻品〉也。 若是領解段即應言領解品，無異下化中根人〈信解品〉也。 若是述誠段即應言述誠品，無異下化中根人有〈藥草品〉也。	004	If it were the section on correct understanding, it should be called the Chapter on Correct Understanding, no different from the Chapter on Correct Understanding in the section on transforming those of middling faculties below.🔽If it were the section on expressing sincerity, it should be called the Chapter on Expressing Sincerity, no different from the Chapter on Medicinal Herbs in the section on transforming those of middling faculties below.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a20_12']	若是受記段即應言受記品，無異下化中根人有〈四大弟子受記品〉也。	若是受記段即應言受記品，無異下化中根人有〈四大弟子受記品〉也。	004	If it were the section on receiving predictions, it should be called the Chapter on Receiving Predictions, no different from the Chapter on the Four Great Disciples Receiving Predictions in the section on transforming those of middling faculties below.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a21_12']	今法說四段所以無有如此品者，有三義因緣：	今法說四段所以無有如此品者，有三義因緣：	004	The reason why the four sections of the Dharma explanation do not have such chapters is due to three meanings and causes:
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a24_10']	其第一意正以下類上，下譬說中既有四品，今以下類上其義可求，若以上類下，下亦應無四品，是故互相映發有無意趣自顯。	其第一意正以下類上，下譬說中既有四品，今以下類上其義可求，若以上類下，下亦應無四品，是故互相映發有無意趣自顯。	004	The first meaning is to use the following to classify the above. Since there are four chapters in the parable explanation below, now using the following to classify the above, the meaning can be sought. If using the above to classify the below, the below should also not have four chapters. Therefore, they mutually reflect each other, and the meaning of existence and non-existence is self-evident.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a26_11']	第二義言但法說文句少故不復立四品，第三義亦可是出經者深取佛意止作二十七品。	第二義言但法說文句少故不復立四品，第三義亦可是出經者深取佛意止作二十七品。	004	The second interpretation says that because the Dharma teaching only has a few phrases, it does not establish four chapters again. The third interpretation can also be that the compiler deeply grasped the Buddha's intention and stopped at twenty-seven chapters.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611a28_7', 'ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b01_8']	于時時眾感悟所宜，如脫更立於時眾無益，然他方異土亦何啻二十七品也。🔽但法說開三顯一化上根中本有四段，從此以下盡偈是第二段，明上根舍利弗等領解也。	于時時眾感悟所宜，如脫更立於時眾無益，然他方異土亦何啻二十七品也。 但法說開三顯一化上根中本有四段，從此以下盡偈是第二段，明上根舍利弗等領解也。	004	At that time, the assembly was moved and enlightened as appropriate. If it were changed again, it would be of no benefit to the assembly at that time. However, in other lands and places, how could it be only twenty-seven chapters?🔽But the Dharma teaching opens up the three and reveals the One, transforming those with the highest faculties. There are four sections. From here on, up to the end of the verse, is the second section, clarifying that those with the highest faculties, such as Śāriputra, have understood.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b04_3']	前判法說四段之中，例開為二，今此領解段中有二者，第一是經家敘舍利弗得解之相，第二正是舍利弗領解之辭。	前判法說四段之中，例開為二，今此領解段中有二者，第一是經家敘舍利弗得解之相，第二正是舍利弗領解之辭。	004	In the previous analysis of the Dharma teaching into four sections, it is divided into two by analogy. In this section on understanding, there are two. The first is the narrator's description of Śāriputra's understanding, and the second is Śāriputra's actual words of understanding.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b05_5']	又就此兩段中各開為二，初經家敘中有二者：	又就此兩段中各開為二，初經家敘中有二者：	004	Moreover, in these two sections, each is divided into two. The first, the narrator's description, has two parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b06_20']	第一先明經家敘內心歡喜，第二經家敘外形恭敬，從「即起合掌」下是也。	第一先明經家敘內心歡喜，第二經家敘外形恭敬，從「即起合掌」下是也。	004	First, it clarifies the joy in the mind described by the sūtra author, second, it describes the external form of respect described by the sūtra author, from immediately rising with palms joined and below.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b08_15']	「而白佛言」以下是第二正領解之辭，亦有二者，第一是長行，第二是偈頌也。	「而白佛言」以下是第二正領解之辭，亦有二者，第一是長行，第二是偈頌也。	004	And addressed the Buddha, saying and below is the second, the words of the correct understanding, which also has two parts, the first is the prose, the second is the verse.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b11_14']	今且就長行中自有三段，第一正明舍利弗自陳得解故歡喜，第二從「是我等咎非世尊也」下竟「思惟取證」，詺為悔過自責也。	今且就長行中自有三段，第一正明舍利弗自陳得解故歡喜，第二從「是我等咎非世尊也」下竟「思惟取證」，詺為悔過自責也。	004	Now, in the prose, there are three sections, the first correctly clarifies Śāriputra's self-declaration of understanding and therefore joy, the second from It is our fault, not the World-Honored One's to contemplating and attaining realization, is called repentance and self-reproach.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b12_9']	第三「我從昔來」下訖長行，結領解也。	第三「我從昔來」下訖長行，結領解也。	004	The third, from I and so forth from the past to the end of the prose, is the conclusion of understanding.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b14_9']	又就此三段中各開為二，又就各開為二中，初重例皆不開，第二重中例復各開為二也。	又就此三段中各開為二，又就各開為二中，初重例皆不開，第二重中例復各開為二也。	004	Moreover, within these three sections, each is divided into two, and within each division into two, the first two are not further divided, and in the second two, each is further divided into two.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b17_8']	今初段中二者，第一正領解，第二從「所以者何」下，舉昔日之憂形釋今日之喜，昔日既有悔有疑故恒憂，今日疑悔除故所以喜也。	今初段中二者，第一正領解，第二從「所以者何」下，舉昔日之憂形釋今日之喜，昔日既有悔有疑故恒憂，今日疑悔除故所以喜也。	004	In the first part, there are two sections: the first is the correct understanding, and the second, from Why is it so? below, uses the form of the worries of the past to explain the joy of the present. Since there was regret and doubt in the past, it was always worried. Since the doubts and regrets have been removed today, this is why there is joy.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b18_16']	就此第二釋中例皆開二者，第一舉昔日悔，第二舉昔日疑。	就此第二釋中例皆開二者，第一舉昔日悔，第二舉昔日疑。	004	In this second explanation, there are two parts in each case: the first is the regret of the past, and the second is the doubt of the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b21_2']	「所以者何」下竟「失於如來無量知見」，是第一詺為舉昔日之悔形釋今日之喜，是則顯今日得解之相。	「所以者何」下竟「失於如來無量知見」，是第一詺為舉昔日之悔形釋今日之喜，是則顯今日得解之相。	004	From Why is it so? below, up to losing the Tathāgata's immeasurable knowledge and insight, is the first part, which is called using the form of the regrets of the past to explain the joy of the present. This then reveals the aspect of understanding attained today.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b21_7']	何以知然？	何以知然？	004	How can this be known?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b23_4']	昔日《大品》座時親見菩薩受學大乘受記成佛，而我不豫斯例，悔不取大可感可傷。	昔日《大品》座時親見菩薩受學大乘受記成佛，而我不豫斯例，悔不取大可感可傷。	004	In the past, at the seat of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, I personally saw bodhisattvas receiving the study of the Mahāyāna and receiving the prediction of becoming a buddha. But I was not included in this example. Regretting not taking the great, it is touching and lamentable.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b24_13']	「無量知見」者即是佛果，然此佛果是昔日所不取，是所悔之事也。	「無量知見」者即是佛果，然此佛果是昔日所不取，是所悔之事也。	004	Immeasurable knowledge and insight refers to the fruition of Buddhahood. However, this fruition of Buddhahood was not attained in the past, and it is the matter of regret.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b27_15']	從「世尊我常獨處」下竟「而見濟度」是第二舉昔日疑形釋今日喜，既實有大乘之法、我等同入無生之理，云何如來以小乘度我、以大乘度彼？	從「世尊我常獨處」下竟「而見濟度」是第二舉昔日疑形釋今日喜，既實有大乘之法、我等同入無生之理，云何如來以小乘度我、以大乘度彼？	004	From World-Honored One, I always dwell alone to and see the rescue and liberation, is the second part, which uses the form of doubts from the past to explain the joy of the present. Since there is truly the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, and we all enter the principle of non-arising, why did the Tathāgata use the Lesser Vehicle to liberate us and the Great Vehicle to liberate others?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611b28_8']	此則以理惑教生此疑心也。	此則以理惑教生此疑心也。	004	This then uses principle to confuse the teachings and gives rise to this doubt.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c01_2']	第二悔過自責中二者，第一「然是我等咎非世尊也」，正總悔過自責也。	第二悔過自責中二者，第一「然是我等咎非世尊也」，正總悔過自責也。	004	In the second part of confessing one's faults and blaming oneself, there are two parts. The first, However, this is our fault, not the World-Honored One's, is the general confession and blaming of oneself.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c02_1']	第二「所以者何」以下，舉別釋總悔過之意。	第二「所以者何」以下，舉別釋總悔過之意。	004	The second, from Why is it so? below, uses specific explanations to illustrate the meaning of the general confession.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c03_9']	昔日恒言我等同入法性，云何如來以小乘度我、以大乘度彼？	昔日恒言我等同入法性，云何如來以小乘度我、以大乘度彼？	004	In the past, it was always said that we all enter the nature of dharmas, so why did the Tathāgata use the Lesser Vehicle to liberate us and the Great Vehicle to liberate others?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c03_18']	常怨世尊無平等心。	常怨世尊無平等心。	004	We always resented the World-Honored One for lacking an impartial mind.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c05_5']	今日方知我自昔無堪受大乘心，致使如來方便說小也。	今日方知我自昔無堪受大乘心，致使如來方便說小也。	004	Only now do I realize that I have long been incapable of receiving the Mahāyāna mind, which has caused the Tathāgata to skillfully expound the Hīnayāna.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c06_14']	然此釋中例有二者，第一先明悔昔不取大，第二明悔取小也。	然此釋中例有二者，第一先明悔昔不取大，第二明悔取小也。	004	However, in this explanation there are also two parts. The first is first clarifying regret for not accepting the Great in the past, and the second is clarifying regret for accepting the Small.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c07_7']	今者第一悔昔日不取大。	今者第一悔昔日不取大。	004	Now, the first is regretting not accepting the Great in the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c08_7']	從「所以者何」下竟「必得大乘而得度脫」者也。	從「所以者何」下竟「必得大乘而得度脫」者也。	004	From Why is it so? up to will surely attain the Great Vehicle and attain liberation.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c09_11']	所因者，今據無上佛果望萬行，萬行是佛果家所因也。	所因者，今據無上佛果望萬行，萬行是佛果家所因也。	004	As for the cause, now based on the unsurpassed Buddha fruit looking at the myriad practices, the myriad practices are the cause for the Buddha fruit.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c10_12']	復據萬行望大乘教，大乘教即是萬行所因。	復據萬行望大乘教，大乘教即是萬行所因。	004	Furthermore, based on the myriad practices looking at the Mahāyāna teaching, the Mahāyāna teaching is precisely the cause for the myriad practices.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c10_17']	何以知然？	何以知然？	004	How can this be known?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c12_13']	秖由大乘教故生萬行，由萬行故感佛果，今此中言所因者秖詺大乘教作因也。	秖由大乘教故生萬行，由萬行故感佛果，今此中言所因者秖詺大乘教作因也。	004	It is precisely because of the Mahāyāna teaching that the myriad practices arise, and because of the myriad practices one experiences the Buddha fruit. The so-called cause mentioned here simply refers to the Mahāyāna teaching as the cause.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c14_11']	然三乘別教亦次第說，鹿苑說四諦，王舍城中說十二因緣，後說《優婆塞戒經》。	然三乘別教亦次第說，鹿苑說四諦，王舍城中說十二因緣，後說《優婆塞戒經》。	004	However, the separate teachings of the three vehicles are also explained in sequence. At the Deer Park, the four truths were explained, in Rājagṛha the twelve links of dependent arising were explained, and later the Upāsaka Precepts Sūtra was explained.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c16_8']	身子自言，我昔日何不待如來說大乘教，於中修行可不得大乘解，而怱怱受三乘小教。	身子自言，我昔日何不待如來說大乘教，於中修行可不得大乘解，而怱怱受三乘小教。	004	Śāriputra himself said, Why did I not wait for the Tathāgata to explain the Mahāyāna teachings in the past, practice them, and attain the understanding of the Mahāyāna, but instead hastily accept the teachings of the three vehicles and the Hīnayāna?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c16_18']	此則悔昔日不取大也。	此則悔昔日不取大也。	004	This is regretting not taking the great [vehicle] in the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c18_1']	然「我等不解方便」此下是第二悔昔日取小也。	然「我等不解方便」此下是第二悔昔日取小也。	004	We did not understand the skillful means and below is the second regret for taking the small [vehicle] in the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c18_19']	我若解如來昔日教是方便者，豈復取小？	我若解如來昔日教是方便者，豈復取小？	004	If I had understood that the Tathāgata's teachings in the past were skillful means, how could I have taken the small [vehicle]?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c20_1']	秖由未解如來昔日方便權教，故仍於中信受。	秖由未解如來昔日方便權教，故仍於中信受。	004	It is precisely because I did not understand the Tathāgata's skillful and provisional teachings in the past that I still believed and accepted them.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c20_10']	此則悔昔日取小也。	此則悔昔日取小也。	004	This is regretting taking the small [vehicle] in the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c22_2']	第三結領解二者，第一「我從昔來」下竟「每自悔責」，先結昔日之憂。	第三結領解二者，第一「我從昔來」下竟「每自悔責」，先結昔日之憂。	004	The third is the conclusion of understanding. The first part, from I have been like this to always regretting and blaming myself, first concludes the worries of the past.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c22_20']	第二「而今從佛」下，結今日得解故喜。	第二「而今從佛」下，結今日得解故喜。	004	The second part, from Now, hearing from the Buddha what I have never heard before, concludes with joy because of attaining understanding today.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c24_13']	例有二者，第一從「而今從佛聞所未聞」竟「快得安隱」，此詺為惡事去故喜也。	例有二者，第一從「而今從佛聞所未聞」竟「快得安隱」，此詺為惡事去故喜也。	004	There are also two examples. The first, from Now, hearing from the Buddha what I have never heard before to I have quickly attained peace and security, refers to joy because of the removal of bad things.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c25_14']	第二「今日乃知真是佛子」下，詺為好事來故喜。	第二「今日乃知真是佛子」下，詺為好事來故喜。	004	The second, from Today I know that I am truly the Buddha's disciple, refers to joy because of the arrival of good things.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c26_16']	昔日謂二乘必不成佛、不能紹繼佛種，故非佛子；	昔日謂二乘必不成佛、不能紹繼佛種，故非佛子；	004	In the past, it was said that the two vehicles would definitely not become Buddhas and would not continue the Buddha's lineage, so they were not the Buddha's disciples;
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c28_2']	今既言汝等所行是菩薩道、必紹繼佛種，故言真佛子也。	今既言汝等所行是菩薩道、必紹繼佛種，故言真佛子也。	004	Now that it is said that what you practice is the bodhisattva path and you will definitely continue the Buddha's lineage, it is said that you are true disciples of the Buddha.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0611c29_13']	「而說偈言」，向言正領解中有二，第一是長行，此下是第二偈頌也。	「而說偈言」，向言正領解中有二，第一是長行，此下是第二偈頌也。	004	And spoke in verse - it was said above that in the correct understanding there are two parts: the first is the prose section, and below this is the second part in verse.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0612a01_4']	但上長行中本有三段：	但上長行中本有三段：	004	But in the above prose section there were originally three parts:
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0612a02_3']	一正自陳得解，二悔過自責，三結領解也。	一正自陳得解，二悔過自責，三結領解也。	004	First, directly expressing one's own understanding; second, repenting and blaming oneself; third, concluding with understanding.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0612a04_2']	今就此二十五行半偈中分為四段，初有十一行半偈，頌上長行中第一正自陳得解也。	今就此二十五行半偈中分為四段，初有十一行半偈，頌上長行中第一正自陳得解也。	004	Now, in this twenty-five and a half line verse, it is divided into four sections. The first eleven and a half lines of verse praise the first part of the above prose, which is the correct self-declaration of understanding.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0612a05_7']	第二從「我本著邪見」下有五行偈，頌上第二悔過自責也。	第二從「我本著邪見」下有五行偈，頌上第二悔過自責也。	004	The second, from I originally adhered to wrong views below, has five lines of verse, praising the second part of the above, which is the repentance and self-reproach.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0612a06_14']	第三從「初聞佛所說」下有六行半偈，頌義出，不頌上長行。	第三從「初聞佛所說」下有六行半偈，頌義出，不頌上長行。	004	The third, from Hearing what the Buddha said for the first time below, has six and a half lines of verse, praising the meaning that comes out, not praising the above prose.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0612a08_2']	上長行中直明昔日疑悔形今日喜也，不言今日有新疑除；	上長行中直明昔日疑悔形今日喜也，不言今日有新疑除；	004	In the above prose, it directly clarifies that the doubts and regrets of the past take shape as joy today, not saying that there are new doubts to be removed today;

For this reason, the mind of doubt and regret arises. Although there are doubts and regrets in the great assembly, there are also doubts and regrets in the mountains and valleys, regretting that I did not seek the Great Vehicle, and giving rise to doubts, thinking that since we have all entered the nature of dharmas, why did the Tathāgata use the Small Vehicle to deliver me and the Great Vehicle to deliver them?

Hesitating between the principle and the teaching, therefore it is said to be a loss and not a loss. This is what it means.

It is precisely because of seeing the Tathāgata's praise of the bodhisattvas in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra, saying their virtues are lofty and their practices are excellent, and they will all attain Buddhahood, that this matter gives rise to doubt.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0612c05_13']	「今聞佛音聲」一偈是第三明今日得解，故昔日疑除，即有二意，上半偈明解開三，下半偈明解顯一，此意即顯昔日以理惑教之是、以教惑理之非，今無漏難思議之力眾生至道場，此語果與昔日以理惑教相應也。	「今聞佛音聲」一偈是第三明今日得解，故昔日疑除，即有二意，上半偈明解開三，下半偈明解顯一，此意即顯昔日以理惑教之是、以教惑理之非，今無漏難思議之力眾生至道場，此語果與昔日以理惑教相應也。	004	Now hearing the Buddha's voice - this one verse is the third, clarifying that today's understanding removes yesterday's doubts. There are two meanings here. The first half of the verse clarifies understanding the disclosure of the three, and the second half of the verse clarifies understanding the revelation of the one. This meaning reveals that yesterday's confusion of principle with teaching was right, and the confusion of teaching with principle was wrong. Today, with the power of the inconceivable Dharma, sentient beings reach the site of enlightenment. This statement accords with yesterday's confusion of principle with teaching.

Now that the upper has already attained understanding first, how can it be directly placed in the same kind without understanding the meaning of returning to the same?
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0613c06_5']	為此意故請佛為說也。	為此意故請佛為說也。	004	For this reason, he requests the Buddha to explain it for them.

In their own practice, they seek the fruit of Buddhahood far away, and in transforming others, they widely deliver sentient beings. Being equipped with these two meanings, they therefore repeatedly request the Buddha to explain it for the people of the middle and lower faculties.

In order to request the Buddha to explain again the meaning of revealing the one in the three for the people of the middle faculties, first, he personally declares his own understanding. It is precisely because he understands the principle of returning to the same that he receives the prediction of attaining bodhi.

The first is the illustrative explanation of dependent origination. The second, from If there are countries, cities, or villages up to the one hundred lines of verse, is the actual illustrative explanation of revealing the One in the teaching of the Three to transform those of middling faculties. However, since those of middling faculties have already understood the principle of returning to the One, they know for themselves that they will definitely attain Buddhahood. Therefore, the third, from You, Śāriputra, I will now explain this Dharma seal up to the end of the chapter, with sixty-five lines of verse, is the encouragement and exhortation for those of middling faculties to accept and practice.

Since I am a disciple of the Buddha, therefore I rebuke like this. Therefore, the second [part] begins with Śāriputra, I will now further explain this meaning with parables.

At that time, he had already created the conditions for their liberation, but when the conditions they responded to were exhausted, the Tathāgata taught and transformed them in other places. However, sentient beings again gave rise to the afflictions of the three poisons, not what he originally intended, so it is said that the fire suddenly arose.

At that time, he had already created the causes for their liberation. Since then, he has again greedily attached to the five sense objects and widely given rise to afflictions, losing the understanding from the past.

['ZH_T33_1715_004:0616b11_13']	如來在世雖復言滿三千、形遍六道，大而為論不出誡、勸兩途，是故出世之始，仍言諸惡莫作眾善奉行，眾善奉行即是大慈勸善，諸惡莫作即是大悲誡惡，是故慈欲與樂勸令行善，悲能拔苦誡令斷惡，故如昔說苦集兩諦，即是大悲誡惡，次明滅道二理，即是大慈勸善。	如來在世雖復言滿三千、形遍六道，大而為論不出誡、勸兩途，是故出世之始，仍言諸惡莫作眾善奉行，眾善奉行即是大慈勸善，諸惡莫作即是大悲誡惡，是故慈欲與樂勸令行善，悲能拔苦誡令斷惡，故如昔說苦集兩諦，即是大悲誡惡，次明滅道二理，即是大慈勸善。	004	Although the Tathāgata was in the world and his words filled the three thousand [worlds] and his form pervaded the six destinies, if we discuss it broadly, it does not go beyond the two paths of admonition and exhortation. Therefore, at the beginning of his appearance in the world, he still said, Do not do any evil, practice all that is good. Practicing all that is good is precisely the great compassion exhorting to do good, and not doing any evil is precisely the great compassion admonishing against evil. Therefore, compassion desires to give happiness and exhorts one to practice good, while compassion can remove suffering and admonishes one to cut off evil. Thus, as was said in the past, the two truths of suffering and accumulation are precisely the great compassion admonishing against evil, and next clarifying the two principles of cessation and the path are precisely the great compassion exhorting to do good.

The first is first using the exhortation to teach and make it suitable, the second is clarifying that the children have no capacity to accept the exhortation, and the third is ceasing the exhortation.

This is using the Great Vehicle to suit their capacities.

First, it clarifies the elder using his body and hands to rescue and save. Internally, it clarifies the Tathāgata's contemplation that the Dharma body has the function of responding and wisdom has the power to deliver and save.
['ZH_T33_1715_004:0616b25_16']	第二言「當以衣裓若以机案從舍出之」，此正明慈念彌至，欲以衣裓裹子，欲以机案擎之，內合如來正用大乘勸教擬宜，衣裓譬大乘因，机案譬大乘果，欲明如來既有智慧身手以大乘因與眾生，欲以大乘果與眾生令出也。	第二言「當以衣裓若以机案從舍出之」，此正明慈念彌至，欲以衣裓裹子，欲以机案擎之，內合如來正用大乘勸教擬宜，衣裓譬大乘因，机案譬大乘果，欲明如來既有智慧身手以大乘因與眾生，欲以大乘果與眾生令出也。	004	The second says to carry them out of the house on a cloth or a table, which directly shows the utmost compassion and desire to wrap the children in a cloth and carry them out on a table. Internally, it corresponds to the Tathāgata's proper use of the exhortive skillful means of the Great Vehicle, with the cloth symbolizing the causes of the Great Vehicle and the table symbolizing the fruits of the Great Vehicle. It clarifies that since the Tathāgata already has the wisdom body and hands, he wishes to give the causes of the Great Vehicle to sentient beings and use the fruits of the Great Vehicle to deliver sentient beings.

Because of their destruction of the Dharma and lack of faith, they would fall into the three evil paths. I would rather not teach the Dharma and quickly enter nirvana.

There are those who encounter the small and give rise to the broad, and there are those who encounter the great and give rise to the narrow.

['ZH_T33_1715_004:0621c23_10']	就第一中自有三：	就第一中自有三：	004	In the first part there are three:

It is precisely because the Tathāgata uses skillful means to guide and transform them that he allows the wholesome roots of wisdom and vows of the Mahayana to be unbroken, and the precious life of wisdom is preserved, let alone the light and insignificant small fruits.
