['ZH_T41_1821_021:0319a12_11']	滅．道諦下非遍見結即是邪見。	滅．道諦下非遍見結即是邪見。	The non-pervasive fetter of views under the truths of cessation and the path is precisely wrong views.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0319a25_5']	此名物等　言取等者。	此名物等　言取等者。	This is called the same substance, etc. As for the statement grasping at the same,
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0319a25_16']	於五見中三見等是所取。	於五見中三見等是所取。	among the five views, the three views are the grasped.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b01_2']	謂於所緣斷彼隨增不名有隨增眠。	謂於所緣斷彼隨增不名有隨增眠。	That is to say, with regard to the objects, abandoning their increase [in number] is not called having latent afflictions that increase [in number].
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b01_11']	以疎遠故故名永斷。	以疎遠故故名永斷。	Because they are distant, they are called permanently abandoned.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b07_4']	容令於境不復生故說之為斷。	容令於境不復生故說之為斷。	Because it is possible to cause them not to arise again with respect to an object, they are said to be cut off.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b07_13']	過去諸惑是已生法。	過去諸惑是已生法。	Past afflictions are already arisen dharmas.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b08_8']	不可令其不復生故云何說斷。	不可令其不復生故云何說斷。	Because it is impossible to cause them not to arise again, how can they be said to be cut off?
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b08_17']	若謂頌說從所緣言。	若謂頌說從所緣言。	If it is said that the verse speaks of the object,

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b10_4']	非於所緣不復起故名之為斷。	非於所緣不復起故名之為斷。	It is not because they do not arise again with respect to the object that they are said to be cut off.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b11_4']	但知諸惑所緣之時即名斷者此亦非理。	但知諸惑所緣之時即名斷者此亦非理。	If it is said that when the objects of the afflictions are known, they are then said to be cut off, this is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b11_9']	不決定故。	不決定故。	Because it is not definite.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0325b12_1']	以斷苦．集他界遍行。	以斷苦．集他界遍行。	Because when suffering and its causes are cut off, the universal [afflictions] of other realms,

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0327b02_7']	如先離欲依未至地入見諦者起法忍智。	如先離欲依未至地入見諦者起法忍智。	For example, one who has previously abandoned desire and enters the path of seeing based on the stage of non-defilement gives rise to the cognition of dharmas and patience.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0327b09_11']	但自治生若起若修兼斷治者有離繫得。	但自治生若起若修兼斷治者有離繫得。	But only the path of self-subjugation gives rise to the attainment of separation when it arises or is cultivated. The path that subdues the eliminated that is combined with it has the attainment of separation.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0327b12_1']	但云得離繫得有由自治生。	但云得離繫得有由自治生。	It is only said that there is the attainment of the attainment of separation due to the arising of the path of self-subjugation.

The above is the text. According to this, it is included in the antidotes of aversion and distance. If that is so, it contradicts the explanation of the place of antidotes. The explanation says that in the explanation of the antidotes, it only says the antidote of elimination, which is the uninterrupted [path].
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0327b22_10', 'ZH_T41_1821_021:0327b22_18']	持治謂解脫。🔽不言無間必斷治。	持治謂解脫。 不言無間必斷治。	Possession refers to liberation.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a12_9']	又應簡言依未至定入見諦者。	又應簡言依未至定入見諦者。	Moreover, one should distinguish and say that this refers to one who enters the truth of the path based on the stage of not yet having attained.

It cannot be said that one abandons what was not previously obtained.🔽The Abhidharma-kośa master rescues [the position] by saying:🔽At the time of the cognition of the class of the path refers to

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a20_3']	謂捨前五得五順下分結盡遍知。	謂捨前五得五順下分結盡遍知。	That is to say, one abandons the previous five and obtains the thorough understanding of the exhaustion of the five lower fetters.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a20_17']	此中有說六地見道捨．得皆爾。	此中有說六地見道捨．得皆爾。	Among them, some say that in the path of seeing of the six stages, the abandoning and obtaining are all like this.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a21_2']	有說後五。	有說後五。	Some say it is the latter five.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a22_4']	三法智位不得遍知　婆沙既言道類智生時。	三法智位不得遍知　婆沙既言道類智生時。	In the stage of the cognition of the law, one does not obtain the thorough understanding. The Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra says that when the cognition of the class of the path arises,
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a22_11']	明知非在現在。	明知非在現在。	it is clear that it is not in the present.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a24_3']	謂六地中後五地。	謂六地中後五地。	That is to say, the latter five stages among the six stages.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a24_12']	婆沙兩說後師為正。	婆沙兩說後師為正。	The later master's explanation is correct in the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a25_6']	以後五地不修欲界斷治故。	以後五地不修欲界斷治故。	This is because in the latter five stages, the antidote to the elimination of the desire realm is not cultivated.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a26_7']	故於欲見三種遍智皆不得也　前師非正。	故於欲見三種遍智皆不得也　前師非正。	Therefore, in the desire realm and the three views, the three kinds of complete knowledge are all not obtained. The former master is not correct.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a26_12']	同妙音故。	同妙音故。	Because it is the same as the wonderful sound.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a27_6']	後五亦修欲斷對治　又云。	後五亦修欲斷對治　又云。	The latter five are also the cultivation of the desire realm to eliminate the antidote. It is also said.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a27_10']	應簡言。	應簡言。	It should be distinguished and said.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a27_15']	亦不須簡。	亦不須簡。	It is also not necessary to distinguish.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a28_6']	言捨前五顯依未至。	言捨前五顯依未至。	It is said that the first five are abandoned to show that they are based on the preliminary stage of concentration.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a28_16']	若依根本即捨二得一。	若依根本即捨二得一。	If based on the fundamental stage, then two are abandoned and one is obtained.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332a29_10']	言捨六者至得離欲時者。	言捨六者至得離欲時者。	It is said that the sixth is abandoned when attaining freedom from desire.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332b01_7']	謂未離欲所有聖者。	謂未離欲所有聖者。	This refers to the noble ones who have not yet been free from desire.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332b01_16']	得離染時成不還果。	得離染時成不還果。	When attaining freedom from defilements, they accomplish the fruit of non-returner.
['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332b02_3']	捨前六故。	捨前六故。	Because the previous six are abandoned.

['ZH_T41_1821_021:0332b05_6']	得三得四對捨說故。	得三得四對捨說故。	Because obtaining three and obtaining four are explained in contrast to abandoning.
