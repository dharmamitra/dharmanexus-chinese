In the state of the good destinies, one often regresses and advances, and it is called the undetermined. From the stage of the practice of faith, the stage does not regress, and it is called the correct determination.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158a25_16']	如其二乘外凡常沒名為邪定，前六方便名為不定，忍法以上名為正定。	如其二乘外凡常沒名為邪定，前六方便名為不定，忍法以上名為正定。	According to the two vehicles, ordinary beings are always submerged and are called the heterodox determination. The first six practices are called the undetermined. The stage of patience and above is called the correct determination.

There is definitely not this meaning, therefore.

['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b10_10']	今即餘教所說三乘皆是穢土，有此三乘故。	今即餘教所說三乘皆是穢土，有此三乘故。	Now, the three vehicles taught in other scriptures are all defiled lands, because these three vehicles exist there.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b12_15']	若生淨土，不問凡聖定向涅槃、定趣善行、定生善道、定行六度，定得解脫故，唯有正定聚而無餘二也。	若生淨土，不問凡聖定向涅槃、定趣善行、定生善道、定行六度，定得解脫故，唯有正定聚而無餘二也。	If one is born in the Pure Land, regardless of being an ordinary person or saint, one definitely heads towards nirvana, definitely engages in wholesome practices, definitely takes rebirth in good destinies, definitely practices the six perfections, and definitely attains liberation. Therefore, there is only the group of those with definite goodness and not the other two groups.

['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b15_10']	諸佛說既共歎，聞名欲生，必得往生故。	諸佛說既共歎，聞名欲生，必得往生故。	Since the buddhas all praise it together, hearing the name and wishing to be born will definitely result in rebirth.

The Guanjing includes those born in the group with wrong views, so even those who commit the five heinous crimes can be reborn there.

['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b20_11']	若不能修十六觀者，雖作餘善必不得生，故此經除之。	若不能修十六觀者，雖作餘善必不得生，故此經除之。	If one is unable to cultivate the sixteen contemplations, even if one performs other good deeds, one will definitely not attain rebirth. Therefore, this sutra excludes them.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b20_16']	此亦非也。	此亦非也。	This is also incorrect.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b21_12']	下品下生亦修十六觀，必違彼經故。	下品下生亦修十六觀，必違彼經故。	Even those of the lowest grade of the lowest level cultivate the sixteen contemplations, which would contradict that sutra.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b22_7']	今即此文，前已釋故，不須更解。	今即此文，前已釋故，不須更解。	This has already been explained in the previous text, so there is no need to explain it again.

['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b28_13']	「假使不能作功德」是假設故，十念亦是《彌勒所問》之所說故。	「假使不能作功德」是假設故，十念亦是《彌勒所問》之所說故。	Even if one is unable to perform meritorious deeds is a hypothetical case, and the ten thoughts are also taught in the Sutra of Maitreya's Questions.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b28_16']	非也。	非也。	No, it is not so.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158b29_10']	假使之言，縱餘功德令發菩提心故。	假使之言，縱餘功德令發菩提心故。	The phrase suppose is used to allow for other merits that may cause one to give rise to the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c01_7']	經言假使，應如餘言，亦是實說故。	經言假使，應如餘言，亦是實說故。	The sutra says suppose, which should be understood like other statements, because it is also a true statement.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c02_13']	又若十念，即非凡夫念，如何於上中二輩不說，唯在下輩故。	又若十念，即非凡夫念，如何於上中二輩不說，唯在下輩故。	Moreover, if the ten recitations are not the recitations of ordinary beings, why are they not mentioned in the upper and middle groups, but only in the lower group?
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c04_18']	今即合彼九品為此三輩，故其義無異，不應難言彼經中上中中二品皆作沙門，亦見真佛不發大心；	今即合彼九品為此三輩，故其義無異，不應難言彼經中上中中二品皆作沙門，亦見真佛不發大心；	Now, combining those nine grades into these three groups, their meaning is no different. It is inappropriate to argue that in that sutra, the upper and middle groups of the middle group all become monks, also see the true Buddha but do not give rise to the great mind;
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c05_17']	中下一生不作沙門，都不見佛不發大心。	中下一生不作沙門，都不見佛不發大心。	while in the lower group of the middle group, in one life they do not become monks, do not see the Buddha at all, and do not give rise to the great mind.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c07_3']	而此中輩非作沙門，亦見化佛發菩提心，義必相違者。	而此中輩非作沙門，亦見化佛發菩提心，義必相違者。	And in this middle group, they do not become monks, also see the transformed Buddha and give rise to the bodhi mind, and the meaning must be contradictory.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c08_2']	中輩之內自有多類，二經各談，其一無違。	中輩之內自有多類，二經各談，其一無違。	Within the middle group, there are many types, and each sutra discusses one of them, without contradiction.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c09_10']	而言當發菩提心者，欲顯生彼必發大心，以簡定性不得生故。	而言當發菩提心者，欲顯生彼必發大心，以簡定性不得生故。	As for saying should give rise to the bodhi mind, it is to show that being born there necessarily gives rise to the great mind, in order to distinguish those of fixed potential who cannot be born there.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c09_20']	餘相違文，皆此類也。	餘相違文，皆此類也。	The other contradictory texts are all of this type.

Even though they cultivate various merits with doubts in their minds, they also believe in the retribution of good and evil, and cultivate the roots of goodness with little aspiration to be born in that land. Because of their uncertain faith, they are not in the first six grades. Because of their little cultivation of blessings, they are also not in the last three. For this reason, they are not included in the nine grades.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c13_16']	此亦不然。	此亦不然。	This is also not correct.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c16_9']	帛謙皆云「中輩之人狐疑不信，雖生彼土，在其城中於五百年不見佛、不聞經、不見聖」，必不可言疑智凡夫不在九品故。	帛謙皆云「中輩之人狐疑不信，雖生彼土，在其城中於五百年不見佛、不聞經、不見聖」，必不可言疑智凡夫不在九品故。	Both the silk and the humble say: People of the middle grade have doubts and disbelief. Even if they are born there, they are in the city for five hundred years without seeing the Buddha, hearing the sutras, or seeing the sages. It is absolutely not acceptable to say that ordinary people with doubts about the five knowledges are not in the nine grades.

['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c18_5']	不決四疑，雖生彼國而在邊地，別是一類非九品攝，是故不應妄生疑惑。	不決四疑，雖生彼國而在邊地，別是一類非九品攝，是故不應妄生疑惑。	The four kinds of uncertainty, although born in that land, are in the border regions, a separate class not included in the nine grades. Therefore, one should not give rise to doubt.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c18_10']	此亦不然。	此亦不然。	This is also not so.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c20_8']	二經所說中下之屬，所止寶城既五百，應如此經，疑智凡夫所在寶宮殿亦是邊地故。	二經所說中下之屬，所止寶城既五百，應如此經，疑智凡夫所在寶宮殿亦是邊地故。	The precious cities where the middle and lower classes mentioned in the two sutras dwell are five hundred, and should be like this sutra. The precious palaces where ordinary people with doubts about the Buddha's wisdom dwell are also border regions.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c22_8']	不爾，便違經云「所居舍宅在地，不能令隨意高大在虛空中，復去阿彌陀佛甚大遠」故。	不爾，便違經云「所居舍宅在地，不能令隨意高大在虛空中，復去阿彌陀佛甚大遠」故。	Otherwise, it contradicts the sutra which says, The houses they dwell in are on the ground, unable to make them rise high in the sky as they wish, and are very far from Amitâbha Buddha.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c25_8']	有說疑佛智人，即此中輩《觀經》中品，故帛謙經中輩云「持戒布施、飯食沙門、作寺起塔，後疑不信，其人暫信暫不信，續結其善願得往生。	有說疑佛智人，即此中輩《觀經》中品，故帛謙經中輩云「持戒布施、飯食沙門、作寺起塔，後疑不信，其人暫信暫不信，續結其善願得往生。	Some say that those who doubt the Buddha's wisdom are the middle grade in this class in the Guanjing. Therefore, the middle grade in the silk-cotton sutra says, Upholding precepts, giving alms, feeding monks, building temples and stupas, later doubting and not believing, that person sometimes believes and sometimes does not believe, continuing to form good wishes and attaining rebirth.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c27_11']	雖生彼國，不得前至無量壽佛所，還道見佛國界邊自然寶城，於五百歲不得見佛聞法」等故。	雖生彼國，不得前至無量壽佛所，還道見佛國界邊自然寶城，於五百歲不得見佛聞法」等故。	Although born in that land, they do not immediately reach the place of Amitâbha Buddha, but on the way they see a natural jeweled city at the border of the Buddha land, and for five hundred years they do not get to see the Buddha or hear the Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c28_4']	不應非法護經中疑佛智人故。	不應非法護經中疑佛智人故。	One should not doubt the Buddha's wisdom in the Fahua Xuanyi.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0158c28_9']	此亦不然。	此亦不然。	This is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0159a01_2']	帛謙下輩亦在路城，於五百年不得見佛，如何疑智唯在中輩而非下耶？	帛謙下輩亦在路城，於五百年不得見佛，如何疑智唯在中輩而非下耶？	In the Fahua Xuanyi, the lower grade also goes to the city on the way, and for five hundred years does not get to see the Buddha. How can one doubt that the wisdom of the middle grade is not the lower grade?
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0159a03_2']	若言中輩疑智修因相似故，故雖屬中品而非下者，亦可下輩受果似中品故攝疑佛智。	若言中輩疑智修因相似故，故雖屬中品而非下者，亦可下輩受果似中品故攝疑佛智。	If it is said that the lower grade is similar to the middle grade in cultivating the causes of doubt and wisdom, therefore although it belongs to the middle grade it is not the lower grade, then it can also be said that the lower grade is similar to the middle grade in receiving the fruits, therefore the doubt and wisdom of the Buddha is included.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0159a04_1']	果雖相似不攝疑智，因雖復同何容疑智？	果雖相似不攝疑智，因雖復同何容疑智？	Although the fruits are similar, the doubt and wisdom are not included. Although the causes are the same, how can the doubt and wisdom be tolerated?
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0159a04_19']	又彼所言九品之內屬於中上，理必不然。	又彼所言九品之內屬於中上，理必不然。	Moreover, what they say about belonging to the middle and upper grades within the nine grades is definitely unreasonable.
['ZH_T37_1748_003:0159a06_3']	《觀經》中中上、此經疑智，華開見佛聞法獲利皆不同故。	《觀經》中中上、此經疑智，華開見佛聞法獲利皆不同故。	In the Guanjing, the middle and upper grades, and the doubt and wisdom of this sutra, the opening of the flowers, seeing the Buddha, hearing the Dharma, and gaining benefits are all different.

Those who stop at the jeweled city and dwell on the ground far from the Buddha are the middling and lower.

Those who wish to be born in that land, hang various silks and brocades, build Buddha temples and stupas, and offer food to monks, should sever love and anger, observe the precepts purely, single-mindedly contemplate the Buddha for ten days without interruption, and are only the lower grade.

The doubts of wise people are shown later as faults.

Consequently, they criticize other schools' interpretation that the five pains are experienced in the human realm, and the five burnings are in hell, saying that this is a great mistake in interpreting the sutra, harming the text and injuring the meaning. This is simply due to not understanding that pain is painful feeling and burning is the instruments of suffering. It is impossible to experience pain in the human realm without the instruments of suffering, and hell has the instruments of suffering but not pain.

Because the sutra says that the retribution of flowers should be considered false words.
