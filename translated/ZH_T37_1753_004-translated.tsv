['ZH_T37_1753_004:0270c26_13']	一明世尊隨機顯益意密難知，非佛自問自徵無由得解。	一明世尊隨機顯益意密難知，非佛自問自徵無由得解。	004	First, it clarifies that the World-Honored One's intention to reveal benefits according to the capacity of beings is difficult to know, and without the Buddha himself asking and investigating, there is no way to understand.

['ZH_T37_1753_004:0270c28_5']	「一者至誠心」，至者真，誠者實。	「一者至誠心」，至者真，誠者實。	004	First, the sincere mind. To means true, sincere means real.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a03_12']	欲明一切眾生身口意業所修解行，必須真實心中作，不得外現賢善精進之相，內懷虛假，貪瞋邪偽奸詐百端，惡性難侵事同蛇蝎，雖起三業，名為雜毒之善，亦名虛假之行，不名真實業也。	欲明一切眾生身口意業所修解行，必須真實心中作，不得外現賢善精進之相，內懷虛假，貪瞋邪偽奸詐百端，惡性難侵事同蛇蝎，雖起三業，名為雜毒之善，亦名虛假之行，不名真實業也。	004	It is to clarify that all sentient beings' physical, verbal, and mental actions and cultivated practices must be done with a true and sincere mind. One cannot outwardly display the appearance of being virtuous and diligent, while inwardly harboring deceit, greed, hatred, and a hundred kinds of evil schemes, with a bad temper difficult to approach, like a scorpion. Although one may engage in the three karmas, it is called good with mixed poisons or deceptive practices, and is not called true and sincere karma.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a05_15']	若作如此安心起行者，縱使苦勵身心，日夜十二時急走急作，如炙頭燃者，眾名雜毒之善。	若作如此安心起行者，縱使苦勵身心，日夜十二時急走急作，如炙頭燃者，眾名雜毒之善。	004	If one practices with such a mind, even if one strenuously exerts body and mind, rushing and working day and night for twelve hours, like one with a burning head, it is called good with mixed poisons.

['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a07_5']	何以故？	何以故？	004	Why is it so?
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a09_13']	正由彼阿彌陀佛因中行菩薩行時，乃至一念一剎那三業所修皆是真實心中作，凡所施為趣求亦皆真實。	正由彼阿彌陀佛因中行菩薩行時，乃至一念一剎那三業所修皆是真實心中作，凡所施為趣求亦皆真實。	004	It is precisely because when Amitâbha Buddha was practicing the bodhisattva path, even a single thought or instant of the three karmas he cultivated was done with a true and sincere mind, and everything he did and sought was also true and sincere.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a10_2']	又真實有二種：	又真實有二種：	004	Moreover, there are two kinds of truth:

['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a13_10']	一者真實心中制捨自他諸惡及穢國等，行住坐臥想同一切菩薩制捨諸惡，我亦如是也。	一者真實心中制捨自他諸惡及穢國等，行住坐臥想同一切菩薩制捨諸惡，我亦如是也。	004	First, in the true mind, one restrains and abandons all evils and defiled lands of oneself and others. In thought, action, standing, walking, sitting, and lying down, one thinks the same as all bodhisattvas in restraining and abandoning all evils, and thinks, I am also like this.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a14_7']	二者真實心中勤修自他凡聖等善。	二者真實心中勤修自他凡聖等善。	004	Second, in the true mind, one diligently cultivates the ordinary and holy virtues of oneself and others.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a15_8']	真實心中口業，讚歎彼阿彌陀佛及依正二報。	真實心中口業，讚歎彼阿彌陀佛及依正二報。	004	In the true mind, one's verbal actions praise the Amitābha Buddha and the two kinds of rewards of his dependent and correct [realms].
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a18_8']	又真實心中口業，毀厭三界六道等自他依正二報苦惡之事，亦讚歎一切眾生三業所為善，若非善業者敬而遠之，亦不隨喜也。	又真實心中口業，毀厭三界六道等自他依正二報苦惡之事，亦讚歎一切眾生三業所為善，若非善業者敬而遠之，亦不隨喜也。	004	Moreover, in the true mind, one's verbal actions despise and detest the suffering and evil matters of the two kinds of rewards of oneself and others in the three realms and six paths, and also praise the good deeds of the three actions of all sentient beings. If it is not a good deed, one respectfully keeps away from it and does not rejoice in it.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a19_17']	又真實心中身業，合掌禮敬四事等供養彼阿彌陀佛及依正二報。	又真實心中身業，合掌禮敬四事等供養彼阿彌陀佛及依正二報。	004	Moreover, in the true mind, one's bodily actions join palms, pay homage, and make offerings of the four things and so forth to the Amitābha Buddha and the two kinds of rewards of his dependent and correct [realms].
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a21_6']	又真實心中身業，輕慢厭捨此生死三界等自他依正二報。	又真實心中身業，輕慢厭捨此生死三界等自他依正二報。	004	Moreover, in the mind of truth, the bodily action is to despise and abandon this birth and death, the three realms, and so forth, the two rewards of self and others' dependent and correct [rebirths].
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a22_17']	又真實心中意業，思想觀察憶念彼阿彌陀佛及依正二報，如現目前。	又真實心中意業，思想觀察憶念彼阿彌陀佛及依正二報，如現目前。	004	Moreover, in the mind of truth, the mental action is to contemplate and observe, and to recollect that Amitâbha Buddha and the two rewards of the dependent and correct [rebirths] are like what is presently before one's eyes.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a24_18']	又真實心中意業，輕賤厭捨此生死三界等自他依正二報，不善三業必須真實心中捨。	又真實心中意業，輕賤厭捨此生死三界等自他依正二報，不善三業必須真實心中捨。	004	Moreover, in the mind of truth, the mental action is to despise and abandon this birth and death, the three realms, and so forth, the two rewards of self and others' dependent and correct [rebirths], and the three unwholesome actions must be abandoned in the mind of truth.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a26_16']	又若起善三業者，必須真實心中作，不簡內外明闇，皆須真實，故名至誠心。	又若起善三業者，必須真實心中作，不簡內外明闇，皆須真實，故名至誠心。	004	Moreover, if one gives rise to the three wholesome actions, one must perform them in the mind of truth. Whether it is internal or external, bright or dark, they must all be true, and therefore it is called the mind of utmost sincerity.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a27_15']	二者深心，言深心者，即是深信之心也。	二者深心，言深心者，即是深信之心也。	004	Second is the profound mind. As for the profound mind, it is the mind of profound faith.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a28_1']	亦有二種。	亦有二種。	004	There are also two kinds.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271a29_16']	一者決定深信，自身現是罪惡生死凡夫，曠劫已來常沒常流轉，無有出離之緣。	一者決定深信，自身現是罪惡生死凡夫，曠劫已來常沒常流轉，無有出離之緣。	004	First, the profound faith of certainty. One's own present self is an ordinary person with sin and evil, birth and death. For vast eons, one has always been submerged and constantly transmigrates, without conditions for liberation.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271b02_13']	二者決定深信，彼阿彌陀佛四十八願攝受眾生，無疑無慮，乘彼願力定得往生。	二者決定深信，彼阿彌陀佛四十八願攝受眾生，無疑無慮，乘彼願力定得往生。	004	Second, have deep and certain faith that Amitābha Buddha's forty-eight vows embrace all beings, without doubt or worry, and by the power of those vows, one will definitely attain rebirth.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271b04_13']	又決定深信，釋迦佛說此《觀經》三福九品定散二善，證讚彼佛依正二報，使人欣慕。	又決定深信，釋迦佛說此《觀經》三福九品定散二善，證讚彼佛依正二報，使人欣慕。	004	Moreover, have deep and certain faith in Śākyamuni Buddha's teachings in the Contemplation Sutra, the three kinds of merit, the nine grades of good and evil, the two kinds of good for the definite and the scattered, and the verification and praise of that Buddha's two kinds of rewards of the fundamental and the derivative, causing people to yearn for them.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271b06_3']	又決定深信，《彌陀經》中十方恒沙諸佛證勸，一切凡夫決定得生。	又決定深信，《彌陀經》中十方恒沙諸佛證勸，一切凡夫決定得生。	004	Moreover, have deep and certain faith in the teachings of the Amitābha Sutra, where the Buddhas of the ten directions and the sands of the Ganges attest and encourage all ordinary beings to definitely attain rebirth.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271b07_13']	又深信者，仰願一切行者等，一心唯信佛語，不顧身命，決定依行。	又深信者，仰願一切行者等，一心唯信佛語，不顧身命，決定依行。	004	Moreover, those with deep faith should aspire that all practitioners will single-mindedly believe only the Buddha's words, disregard their bodies and lives, and definitely practice according to them.
['ZH_T37_1753_004:0271b10_3']	佛遣捨者即捨，佛遣行者即行，佛遣去處即去，是名隨順佛教、隨順佛意，是名隨順佛願，是名真佛弟子。	佛遣捨者即捨，佛遣行者即行，佛遣去處即去，是名隨順佛教、隨順佛意，是名隨順佛願，是名真佛弟子。	004	If the Buddha tells them to abandon something, they should abandon it; if the Buddha tells them to practice something, they should practice it; if the Buddha tells them to go somewhere, they should go there. This is called following the Buddha's teachings, following the Buddha's intentions, following the Buddha's vows, and being a true disciple of the Buddha.
