['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a14_10']	為顯邪執我我所事性相皆空，方便開示三解脫門，故造斯論。	為顯邪執我我所事性相皆空，方便開示三解脫門，故造斯論。	In order to show that the self and its belongings grasped by wrong views are all empty in nature and characteristics, [the treatise] skillfully reveals the three gates of liberation, and thus this treatise is composed.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a16_8']	執見事性為方便故起相分別，隨取事相為依止故生邪願樂，既顯事空，二即非有。	執見事性為方便故起相分別，隨取事相為依止故生邪願樂，既顯事空，二即非有。	Because grasping the nature of perceived objects as a skillful means, one gives rise to discrimination of characteristics. Following the grasping of the characteristics of perceived objects as a basis, one gives rise to wrong aspirations and enjoyments. Since the emptiness of perceived objects is shown, the two [i.e., discrimination and wrong aspirations/enjoyments] are then non-existent.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a17_2']	其我所事略有二種，謂常、無常。	其我所事略有二種，謂常、無常。	The perceived objects of its belongings are roughly of two kinds, namely, permanent and impermanent.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a18_5']	常住事勝寂靜安樂，眾生聞樂清曠無為多生欣樂。	常住事勝寂靜安樂，眾生聞樂清曠無為多生欣樂。	The superior, tranquil, and blissful state of permanent abiding - when sentient beings hear of the bliss, peace, and effortless nature of this state, they often give rise to delight and joy.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a19_8']	無常事劣能引諸苦，眾生見苦熾火所燒多生厭離。	無常事劣能引諸苦，眾生見苦熾火所燒多生厭離。	Impermanent things are inferior and can lead to suffering. Sentient beings, seeing suffering like being burned by a raging fire, often give rise to aversion.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a19_17']	由是論初先破常事。	由是論初先破常事。	Therefore, the treatise first refutes permanent things.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a24_19']	諸有世間鄙執他論，所說種種常住句義，多越現量所行境界，以能生果比量安立。	諸有世間鄙執他論，所說種種常住句義，多越現量所行境界，以能生果比量安立。	The various worldly contemptible doctrines and the various meanings of permanence spoken by others often go beyond the scope of direct perception, being established by inference through their ability to produce effects.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a25_18']	既能生果，亦應比度從緣而生，如麁色等。	既能生果，亦應比度從緣而生，如麁色等。	Since they can produce effects, they should also be inferred to arise from conditions, like gross forms and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a26_18']	若非緣生，無勝體用，應不能生，如空花等。	若非緣生，無勝體用，應不能生，如空花等。	If they do not arise from conditions, lacking superior substance and function, they should be unable to produce, like space flowers and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a27_16']	若許彼義從緣而生，即定滅壞，如所生果。	若許彼義從緣而生，即定滅壞，如所生果。	If it is accepted that their meaning arises from conditions, then they would definitely be destroyed, like the effects that are produced.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a28_15']	所以佛說諸行無常，從緣生滅，如苦樂等。	所以佛說諸行無常，從緣生滅，如苦樂等。	Therefore, the Buddha said that all conditioned things are impermanent, arising and ceasing from conditions, like pleasure, pain, and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187a29_18']	是故唯佛無顛倒說，得名如來，見一切境無罣礙故。	是故唯佛無顛倒說，得名如來，見一切境無罣礙故。	Therefore, only the Buddha's teachings are free from error, and he is called the Tathāgata because he sees all objects without obstruction.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b02_7']	若爾所餘無生果用此應是常，既不生果，不可比度，從緣生故。	若爾所餘無生果用此應是常，既不生果，不可比度，從緣生故。	If that is so, the other unproduced fruits and functions should be permanent, since they do not produce fruits, they cannot be inferred to arise from conditions.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b03_6']	雖爾既無能生果用，如永滅無，應比非有。	雖爾既無能生果用，如永滅無，應比非有。	Although that is so, since they lack the ability to produce fruits, they are like complete cessation and do not exist, as can be inferred.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b07_17']	諸有性法，定從緣生，如苦樂等。	諸有性法，定從緣生，如苦樂等。	All dharmas with a nature definitely arise from conditions, like suffering, happiness, and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b08_12']	若非緣生，定無有性，如空花等。	若非緣生，定無有性，如空花等。	If they are not produced from conditions, they definitely have no nature, like space flowers and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b09_3']	此若有性，應從緣生。	此若有性，應從緣生。	If this [unproduced dharma] has a nature, it should arise from conditions.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b09_18']	若從緣生，滅必隨逐，無容常住。	若從緣生，滅必隨逐，無容常住。	If it arises from conditions, cessation will definitely follow, and it cannot be allowed to abide permanently.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b11_3']	或復諸法必依緣生方知有性，如現在法。	或復諸法必依緣生方知有性，如現在法。	Or, perhaps all dharmas are known to have a nature only when they definitely arise in dependence on conditions, like present dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b11_18']	若非緣生，即非有性，如未來法。	若非緣生，即非有性，如未來法。	If they do not arise in dependence on conditions, then they do not have a nature, like future dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b12_13']	為辨此義，故說無有時方等言。	為辨此義，故說無有時方等言。	In order to explain this meaning, the words time, place, etc. are spoken.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b13_3']	此顯所說其理決定。	此顯所說其理決定。	This shows that the principle being discussed is certain.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b14_3']	若時若方若物差別，遍一切處皆無諍論。	若時若方若物差別，遍一切處皆無諍論。	Whether in terms of time, place, or the distinctions of things, everywhere there is no dispute.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b15_6']	如說菩薩住循法觀，於諸法中不見少法出緣生外。	如說菩薩住循法觀，於諸法中不見少法出緣生外。	As it is said, The bodhisattva abides in the contemplation of dharmas, and in all dharmas he does not see a single dharma that goes beyond dependent arising.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b19_2']	彼雖方便慇懃立常，而竟不能說有道理。	彼雖方便慇懃立常，而竟不能說有道理。	Although they earnestly apply their ingenuity to establish permanence, in the end they are unable to speak of any principle.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b20_2']	如是句義，所立能立一分所依不極成故。	如是句義，所立能立一分所依不極成故。	In this way, the meaning of the statement is that one part of the basis of the proof is not established.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b21_1']	既不許有餘同類義，同喻闕故，比量不成。	既不許有餘同類義，同喻闕故，比量不成。	Since they do not admit the existence of other similar meanings, the example lacks a common property, and the inference is not established.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b21_11']	設復強說，終成非理。	設復強說，終成非理。	Even if one were to forcibly speak of it, it would still be unreasonable.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b24_19']	縱彼強說常性有因，既許有因，即非常性，如苦熾火相應所生，此因便能違害根本。	縱彼強說常性有因，既許有因，即非常性，如苦熾火相應所生，此因便能違害根本。	Even if one were to forcibly speak of permanence having a cause, since it is admitted that there is a cause, it is not a permanent nature. Like the characteristics produced by a blazing fire of suffering, this cause can contradict the basis.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b25_18']	雖無生因而有了因，有因總故，即為極成。	雖無生因而有了因，有因總故，即為極成。	Although there is no cause of arising, there is a cause of existence. Because of the general existence of causes, it is established.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b27_9']	復次有執一切性皆是常，若立一切皆無常性，俱闕同喻，比量不成。	復次有執一切性皆是常，若立一切皆無常性，俱闕同喻，比量不成。	Furthermore, there is the grasping that all natures are permanent. If one establishes that all are impermanent, both lack a similar example, and the inference is not established.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187b27_19']	此亦不然，同前過故。	此亦不然，同前過故。	This is also not so, because of the same error as before.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187c01_6']	又彼雖立隱性為常，而立顯相有其生滅，由此足能顯無常性、遮破常性，彼論遮破顯相是常及非有故。	又彼雖立隱性為常，而立顯相有其生滅，由此足能顯無常性、遮破常性，彼論遮破顯相是常及非有故。	Moreover, although they establish the hidden nature as permanent, they establish that the manifest characteristics have arising and ceasing. Because of this, it is sufficient to manifest the nature of impermanence and refute the nature of permanence. Because that treatise refutes the manifest characteristics as being permanent and non-existent.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187c02_6']	若說顯相亦無生滅，前位無減、後位無增。	若說顯相亦無生滅，前位無減、後位無增。	If it is said that the manifest characteristics also have no arising and ceasing, with no decrease in the previous state and no increase in the later state.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187c03_17']	若謂諸法雖有隱顯而無生滅，此亦不然。	若謂諸法雖有隱顯而無生滅，此亦不然。	If it is said that although dharmas have concealment and manifestation, they have no arising and ceasing, this is also not so.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187c04_17']	前後兩位若無差別，便無增減，有何隱顯？	前後兩位若無差別，便無增減，有何隱顯？	If there is no difference between the two periods of time before and after, then there is no increase or decrease. What concealment and manifestation are there?
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187c05_16']	又離體外無別有位，位有隱顯，體亦應然。	又離體外無別有位，位有隱顯，體亦應然。	Moreover, apart from the substance, there is no separate time. If time has concealment and manifestation, the substance should also be so.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187c06_15']	汝雖不欲體有生滅，理所逼故，必應信受。	汝雖不欲體有生滅，理所逼故，必應信受。	Although you do not wish for the substance to have arising and ceasing, because of the pressure of reason, you must necessarily believe and accept it.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0187c08_13']	如是所立前後兩位，隱顯非常為同法喻，由此我立不與汝同，立常同喻定非有故。	如是所立前後兩位，隱顯非常為同法喻，由此我立不與汝同，立常同喻定非有故。	In this way, the established two periods of time, concealment and manifestation, are not permanent, serving as a similar example. Because of this, my establishment is not the same as yours, because the established permanent similar example definitely does not exist.

Views are causes of doubt, so the means of knowledge that they depend on are all difficult to believe and accept.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191a28_19']	要依前後方分差別起取捨用，乃名為行。	要依前後方分差別起取捨用，乃名為行。	One must rely on the distinction of the former and latter to give rise to the function of taking and abandoning, which is then called activity.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191a29_9']	離方分行，所未曾見。	離方分行，所未曾見。	Apart from the activity of distinction, we have never seen it.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191b01_7']	極微既是行用所依，故知極微定有方分。	極微既是行用所依，故知極微定有方分。	Since the ultimate atom is the basis of activity, we know that the ultimate atom definitely has distinction.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191b02_6']	若無所行行用差別，是則應撥行者為無。	若無所行行用差別，是則應撥行者為無。	If there is no distinction in the activity of the object of activity, then one should deny that the active person exists.

If so, although active, one should be like something unmoving.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191b06_17']	若汝撥無行處行用，是則所依行者亦無，執此極微便著邪見。	若汝撥無行處行用，是則所依行者亦無，執此極微便著邪見。	If you deny the activity of the object of activity, then the active person as the basis also does not exist. Grasping these ultimate atoms, one then falls into wrong views.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191b07_16']	又諸極微若無行用，則不能造有方分果。	又諸極微若無行用，則不能造有方分果。	Moreover, if the ultimate atoms have no activity, then they cannot produce effects with distinction.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191b10_4']	若無所造有方分果，即諸天眼亦無所見，是則所立一切句義，越諸根境頓絕名言，云何自立句義差別？	若無所造有方分果，即諸天眼亦無所見，是則所立一切句義，越諸根境頓絕名言，云何自立句義差別？	If there is a result with spatial parts that is not produced, then the divine eye also sees nothing. Then all the established meanings would transcend the objects of the senses and be completely cut off from words. How can one establish the distinctions of meanings oneself?

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191b19_16']	是則極微越諸根境，不為一切眼所觀見，自他推撿都不可得，是故不應計為實有。	是則極微越諸根境，不為一切眼所觀見，自他推撿都不可得，是故不應計為實有。	Then the extreme atom would transcend the objects of the senses and not be seen by any eye. It would be completely unobtainable when examined by oneself or others. Therefore, it should not be considered to be truly existent.

Since they mutually enter each other, the parts are separated, just as separated things do not produce effects together. Then there would be no coarse things at all.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c04_4']	又若同彼有諸細分，即應如彼體是無常。	又若同彼有諸細分，即應如彼體是無常。	Moreover, if they are like that and have subtle parts, then they should be impermanent like that.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c05_3']	若許如後自說極微，體有變壞何待徵難？	若許如後自說極微，體有變壞何待徵難？	If you admit the latter, you yourself say that atoms have substance and change. Why wait for questioning and difficulty?
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c07_1']	若並不許，應許極微互相障隔因果別處，以有礙物處必不同，如非因果諸有礙物。	若並不許，應許極微互相障隔因果別處，以有礙物處必不同，如非因果諸有礙物。	If you do not admit either, you should admit that atoms mutually obstruct each other, and cause and effect are in separate places, because obstructed things cannot be in the same place, just like non-cause and effect obstructed things.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c12_8']	對礙與常互相違反，二法同體理所不然。	對礙與常互相違反，二法同體理所不然。	Obstruction and permanence are mutually contradictory, and it is unreasonable for two dharmas to have the same substance.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c13_8']	餘物共合變壞生因，名為有對。	餘物共合變壞生因，名為有對。	The cause of the arising of change and destruction through the combination of other objects is called obstruction.

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c17_12']	若謂極微障礙餘物，他不全許，故須別立餘物共合變壞生因，比度極微是無常者，是則但應以能生義證極微性定是無常，何以頌中說為有對？	若謂極微障礙餘物，他不全許，故須別立餘物共合變壞生因，比度極微是無常者，是則但應以能生義證極微性定是無常，何以頌中說為有對？	If it is said that atoms obstruct other objects, but others do not fully accept this, therefore it is necessary to separately establish the cause of the arising of change and destruction through the combination of other objects, and infer that atoms are impermanent, then it should only be possible to prove the nature of atoms as definitely impermanent by the meaning of being able to produce them. Why is it said to be obstruction in the verse?
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c18_2']	故知此言是有礙義。	故知此言是有礙義。	Therefore, we know that this statement means having obstruction.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c19_1']	雖不全許，而因義成，彼許極微礙餘物故。	雖不全許，而因義成，彼許極微礙餘物故。	Although it is not fully accepted, the meaning of the cause is established because they accept that atoms obstruct other objects.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c20_18']	既破極微方亦隨壞，因極微果證實有方，極微既無，果則非有，何緣而立方實常耶？	既破極微方亦隨壞，因極微果證實有方，極微既無，果則非有，何緣而立方實常耶？	Since atoms are refuted, space is also destroyed. The cause of atoms is the proof of the true existence of space. Since atoms do not exist, the effect does not exist. On what basis is space established as real and permanent?
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c21_17']	又方不定待緣而立，假施設有，非實非常。	又方不定待緣而立，假施設有，非實非常。	Moreover, direction is not established in dependence on conditions, it is provisionally established as existing, not real and not permanent.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c23_5']	由上所說諸因緣故，極微是常，佛未曾說，但言諸行皆是無常。	由上所說諸因緣故，極微是常，佛未曾說，但言諸行皆是無常。	For the above reasons, the ultimate atom is permanent. The Buddha has never said that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent.
['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c26_2']	唯我大師獨稱覺者，於一切境智見無礙，所說無倒真號如來，愍彼邪徒不能歸信諸行無常，誠哉佛說無為非行，何廢常耶？	唯我大師獨稱覺者，於一切境智見無礙，所說無倒真號如來，愍彼邪徒不能歸信諸行無常，誠哉佛說無為非行，何廢常耶？	Only our Great Master, the Sole Awakened One, has unobstructed knowledge and insight into all realms. What he says is unmistaken, truly called the Tathāgata. He pities those in wrong paths who are unable to believe and return to the impermanence of all conditioned phenomena. Indeed, the Buddha said that the unconditioned is not a conditioned phenomenon. How can it be abandoned as permanent?

['ZH_T30_1571_001:0191c28_1']	若有所作非謂無為，若無所作但有名想。	若有所作非謂無為，若無所作但有名想。	If it has function, it is not called unconditioned. If it has no function, it is merely a nominal concept.
