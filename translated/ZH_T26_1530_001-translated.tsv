['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291b14_5']	《佛地經》者，具一切智、一切種智，離煩惱障及所知障，於一切法、一切種相能自開覺，亦能開覺一切有情，如睡夢覺、如蓮花開，故名為佛地。	《佛地經》者，具一切智、一切種智，離煩惱障及所知障，於一切法、一切種相能自開覺，亦能開覺一切有情，如睡夢覺、如蓮花開，故名為佛地。	001	The Buddha-bhumi Sutra is endowed with omniscience and knowledge of all modes, free from the afflictive obstructions and the obstructions to knowledge. It is able to awaken oneself to all dharmas and all modes of characteristics, and also able to awaken all sentient beings, like awakening from a dream or like a lotus flower opening, therefore it is called the stage of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291b17_14']	謂所依、所行、所攝，即當所說清淨法界大圓鏡智、平等性智、妙觀察智、成所作智受用和合一味事等，是佛所依、所行、所攝，故名佛地，能貫能攝，故名為經。	謂所依、所行、所攝，即當所說清淨法界大圓鏡智、平等性智、妙觀察智、成所作智受用和合一味事等，是佛所依、所行、所攝，故名佛地，能貫能攝，故名為經。	001	That is, the basis, the activity, and what is included, which correspond to the pure Dharma realm, the great perfect mirror cognition, the cognition of equality, the cognition of marvelous observation, and the cognition accomplishing the task, as well as the enjoyment and unification of a single flavor, etc. This is what the Buddha relies on, what he practices, and what he includes, and is therefore called the stage of the Buddha. Because it can penetrate and include, it is called a sutra.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291b20_9']	以佛聖教貫穿攝持，所應說義所化生故，應知此中宣說佛地饒益有情，依所詮義名「佛地經」，如《緣起經》，如《集寶論》。	以佛聖教貫穿攝持，所應說義所化生故，應知此中宣說佛地饒益有情，依所詮義名「佛地經」，如《緣起經》，如《集寶論》。	001	Because the Buddha's holy teachings penetrate and include the meaning to be explained and the beings to be transformed, one should know that here it proclaims the stage of the Buddha for the benefit of beings. It is called the Sutra of the Buddha Stage based on the meaning it expresses, like the Sutra of Dependent Origination and the Treatise on Collecting Treasures.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291b23_18']	略說此經所攝義者，謂顯世尊佛土圓滿、功德圓滿、眷屬圓滿，安立佛地五法總別受用和合一味事智，依淨法界具諸功德三身差別。	略說此經所攝義者，謂顯世尊佛土圓滿、功德圓滿、眷屬圓滿，安立佛地五法總別受用和合一味事智，依淨法界具諸功德三身差別。	001	As for the meaning included in this sutra, it shows the perfect land of the World-Honored Buddha, his perfect merits, and his perfect retinue. It establishes the five dharmas of the stage of the Buddha, the general and specific enjoyment and unification of a single flavor, and the cognition of things, based on the pure Dharma realm endowed with all merits and the distinctions of the three bodies.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291b25_12']	此則次第示現，如來居如是處、具如是德、如是眾俱安立、如是地義差別。	此則次第示現，如來居如是處、具如是德、如是眾俱安立、如是地義差別。	001	This then sequentially manifests the Tathāgata's dwelling in such a place, possessing such virtues, the assembly of such beings, and the distinctions in the meaning of such a ground.

['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291b29_3']	如是眾者，謂無數量諸大聲聞、摩訶薩眾，成就種種微妙功德。	如是眾者，謂無數量諸大聲聞、摩訶薩眾，成就種種微妙功德。	001	As for such an assembly, it refers to the innumerable great śrāvakas and the assembly of mahāsattvas, who have accomplished various subtle and wonderful virtues.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c01_11']	地義別者，謂大覺地五法總別受用和合一味事等，後當廣說。	地義別者，謂大覺地五法總別受用和合一味事等，後當廣說。	001	As for the distinctions in the meaning of the ground, it refers to the ground of great enlightenment, the general and specific characteristics of the five dharmas, the unified and single-flavored enjoyment, and so forth, which will be extensively explained later.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c02_8']	於此經中總有三分：	於此經中總有三分：	001	In this sūtra, there are a total of three parts:

Specifically, it shows the teacher of the teaching and the place where the teaching arose. The teaching's being directed to beings is the cause and condition for the teaching's arising, therefore it is called the section on the causes and conditions for the teaching's arising.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c06_13']	正顯聖教所說法門品類差別故，名聖教所說分。	正顯聖教所說法門品類差別故，名聖教所說分。	001	It clearly shows the various types of Dharma gates taught in the holy teaching, therefore it is called the section on what is taught in the holy teaching.

['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c16_17']	或許可言，是事如是有義，此中唯依許可。	或許可言，是事如是有義，此中唯依許可。	001	Or the words of permission may be, This matter exists like this. In this case, it only relies on permission.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c17_11']	謂結集時諸菩薩眾咸共請言：	謂結集時諸菩薩眾咸共請言：	001	That is to say, when compiling the teachings, the assembly of bodhisattvas all jointly requested, saying:
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c18_2']	「如汝所聞當如是說。	「如汝所聞當如是說。	001	You should speak in this way according to what you have heard.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c18_12']	」傳法菩薩便許彼言：	」傳法菩薩便許彼言：	001	The bodhisattva who transmitted the teachings then permitted them, saying:
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c19_10']	「如是當說如我所聞，又如是言信可審定。	「如是當說如我所聞，又如是言信可審定。	001	I will speak in this way according to what I have heard. Moreover, these words can be ascertained as trustworthy.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c20_13']	」謂如是法，我昔曾聞，此事如是，齊此當說定無有異。	」謂如是法，我昔曾聞，此事如是，齊此當說定無有異。	001	That is to say, this Dharma I have heard like this in the past. This matter is like this. I will speak up to this point. It is definitely without error.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c21_3']	有義此中亦依問答。	有義此中亦依問答。	001	According to one interpretation, this also relies on question and answer.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c21_8']	謂有問言：	謂有問言：	001	That is to say, there is a question, saying:

['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c22_19']	」有義，此中通依四種：	」有義，此中通依四種：	001	There is an interpretation that this [phrase] refers to four kinds of [teachings]:
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c23_15']	依譬喻者，謂當所說如是文句，如我昔聞。	依譬喻者，謂當所說如是文句，如我昔聞。	001	[First,] according to the proponents of similes, it means that the following words and phrases are like what I heard in the past.

['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c24_18']	餘如前說。	餘如前說。	001	The rest is as explained above.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c26_6']	我謂諸蘊世俗假者，聞謂耳根發識聽受，廢別就總故說我聞。	我謂諸蘊世俗假者，聞謂耳根發識聽受，廢別就總故說我聞。	001	I refers to the conventional designation of the aggregates. Heard means the ear faculty producing consciousness and receiving what is heard. Omitting the specific, it is said in general that I heard.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0291c29_8']	有義，如來慈悲本願增上緣力，聞者識上文義相生，此文義相雖親依自善根力起，而就強緣名為佛說，由耳根力自心變現，故名我聞。	有義，如來慈悲本願增上緣力，聞者識上文義相生，此文義相雖親依自善根力起，而就強緣名為佛說，由耳根力自心變現，故名我聞。	001	There is an interpretation that by the power of the Tathāgata's original vow of compassion, the images of words and meanings are produced in the consciousness of the listener. Although these images of words and meanings arise based on the power of one's own wholesome roots, they are called the Buddha's teachings based on the dominant condition. Because they are transformed by one's own mind through the power of the ear faculty, they are called what I heard.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a02_10']	有義，聞者善根本願增上緣力，如來識上文義相生，此文義相是佛利他善根所起，名為佛說。	有義，聞者善根本願增上緣力，如來識上文義相生，此文義相是佛利他善根所起，名為佛說。	001	There is an interpretation by Sthiramati that by the power of the fundamental consciousness of the listener, which is good, and the power of his fundamental vow, images of words and meanings are produced in the consciousness of the Tathāgata. These images of words and meanings are produced by the good roots of the Tathāgata for the benefit of others and are therefore called the Buddha’s teaching.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a03_15']	聞者識心雖不取得，然似彼相分明顯現，故名我聞。	聞者識心雖不取得，然似彼相分明顯現，故名我聞。	001	Even though the consciousness of the listener does not grasp them, still they appear clearly as images similar to them, and for that reason they are called what I have heard.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a07_14']	應知說此如是我聞，意避增減異分過失，謂如是法我從佛聞，非他展轉顯示聞者，有所堪能，諸有所聞皆離增減異分過失，非如愚夫無所堪能，諸有所聞或不能離增減異分。	應知說此如是我聞，意避增減異分過失，謂如是法我從佛聞，非他展轉顯示聞者，有所堪能，諸有所聞皆離增減異分過失，非如愚夫無所堪能，諸有所聞或不能離增減異分。	001	You should know that the statement, “Thus have I heard,” is intended to avoid the errors of addition, subtraction, and alteration. It means that I have heard this teaching from the Buddha and not from another person. It shows that the listener is capable, and that whatever he has heard is free from the errors of addition, subtraction, and alteration. It is not like the case of a foolish person who is incapable and whatever he hears may be subject to the errors of addition, subtraction, or alteration.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a10_2']	結集法時傳佛教者，依如來教初說此言，為令眾生恭敬信受，言如是法我從佛聞，文義決定無所增減。	結集法時傳佛教者，依如來教初說此言，為令眾生恭敬信受，言如是法我從佛聞，文義決定無所增減。	001	When the teachings were compiled, the transmitter of the Buddha’s teachings relied on the teachings of the Tathāgata and at the beginning said these words in order to cause sentient beings to respectfully believe and accept them. He said, “The words and meanings of this teaching I have heard from the Buddha, and they are certain and free from the errors of addition or subtraction.”
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a11_1']	是故聞者應正聞已，如理思惟當勤修學。	是故聞者應正聞已，如理思惟當勤修學。	001	Therefore, those who hear it should listen correctly and then contemplate it according to the principles, and diligently cultivate and study it.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a12_10']	言一時者，謂說聽時，此就剎那相續無斷，說聽究竟總名一時。	言一時者，謂說聽時，此就剎那相續無斷，說聽究竟總名一時。	001	As for the phrase at one time, it refers to the time of speaking and listening. This is based on the uninterrupted continuity of moments, and the overall completion of speaking and listening is called at one time.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a13_10']	若不爾者，字名句等說聽時異，云何言一？	若不爾者，字名句等說聽時異，云何言一？	001	If it were not so, since the spoken words, names, and phrases would be different from the heard ones, how could it be called at one time?
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a14_18']	或能說者得陀羅尼，於一字中一剎那頃能持能說一切法門。	或能說者得陀羅尼，於一字中一剎那頃能持能說一切法門。	001	Or, the speaker may attain dhāraṇī, and in one moment be able to uphold and speak all Dharma gates within one word.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a16_16']	或能聽者得淨耳根，一剎那頃聞一字時，於餘一切皆無障礙悉能領受，故名一時。	或能聽者得淨耳根，一剎那頃聞一字時，於餘一切皆無障礙悉能領受，故名一時。	001	Or, the listener may attain a purified ear faculty, and when hearing one word in one moment, be unobstructed with regard to all else and be able to receive it all, thus it is called at one time.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a18_5']	或相會遇時分無別，故名一時，即是說聽共相會遇同一時義。	或相會遇時分無別，故名一時，即是說聽共相會遇同一時義。	001	Or, the time of meeting is no different, thus it is called at one time, which means that the speaker and listener meet together at the same time.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a20_7']	時者，即是有為法上假立分位，或是心上分位影像，依色心等總假立故，是不相應行蘊所攝。	時者，即是有為法上假立分位，或是心上分位影像，依色心等總假立故，是不相應行蘊所攝。	001	Time is the temporary state of conditioned dharmas, or the reflected image of temporary states in the mind. It is generally established based on form, mind, etc., and is included in the aggregate of mental activities not directly associated with mind.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a20_12']	何不別顯？	何不別顯？	001	Why is it not separately indicated?
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a21_15']	如下處等，但說一時晝夜時分，諸方不定不可別說。	如下處等，但說一時晝夜時分，諸方不定不可別說。	001	Just as below, above, etc., only speak of one time, day and night, the directions are indefinite and cannot be separately spoken of.
['ZH_T26_1530_001:0292a23_4']	又義不定，或一剎那或復相續不可定說，是故總相但說一時。	又義不定，或一剎那或復相續不可定說，是故總相但說一時。	001	Moreover, the meaning is indefinite, either one moment or a continuum, it cannot be definitely spoken of. Therefore, the general characteristic only speaks of one time.
