['ZH_T39_1795_01b:0537c02_19']	二、大乘權教，明異熟賴耶名為一心，遮無境故；	二、大乘權教，明異熟賴耶名為一心，遮無境故；	01b	Second, the provisional teachings of the Mahāyāna clarify the ālaya-vijñāna of karmic retribution as being called the one mind, in order to refute the absence of objects;
['ZH_T39_1795_01b:0537c03_20']	三、大乘實教，說如來藏以為一心，理無二故；	三、大乘實教，說如來藏以為一心，理無二故；	01b	Third, the true teachings of the Mahāyāna speak of the tathāgatagarbha as being the one mind, because principle is non-dual;
['ZH_T39_1795_01b:0537c04_21']	四、一乘頓教，泯絕染淨，但是一心，破諸數故；	四、一乘頓教，泯絕染淨，但是一心，破諸數故；	01b	Fourth, the sudden teachings of the One Vehicle obliterate defilement and purity, and are merely the one mind, in order to destroy all distinctions;

['ZH_T39_1795_01b:0537c08_20']	然皆說一心，有斯異者，蓋以經隨機說、論逐經通、人隨論執，致令末代固守淺權。	然皆說一心，有斯異者，蓋以經隨機說、論逐經通、人隨論執，致令末代固守淺權。	01b	However, they all speak of the one mind, with these differences, because the sūtras speak according to the capacities of the audience, the treatises follow the sūtras, and people follow the treatises in their understanding, leading to the later generations stubbornly adhering to the shallow and provisional.

['ZH_T39_1795_01b:0537c12_12']	初約所詮，逆次順法，從四至一展轉起末，謂本唯非染非淨一法界心，由不覺之名如來藏，與生滅合成阿梨耶識。	初約所詮，逆次順法，從四至一展轉起末，謂本唯非染非淨一法界心，由不覺之名如來藏，與生滅合成阿梨耶識。	01b	First, regarding the expressed meaning, it goes against the sequence of the Dharma, from four to one, and the branches are gradually produced. That is to say, the root is the non-defiled and non-pure one mind of the Dharma realm, which is called the Tathāgatagarbha due to non-enlightenment, and together with arising and ceasing, it forms the ālaya consciousness.

Because of the seeing, it appears as if external objects, and because of grasping this appearance as definite and real, various individual karmas and shared karmas are created.

['ZH_T39_1795_01b:0537c23_17']	三、能詮所詮逆順本末皆無障礙，由稱法性直，譚不逐機，宜異說故，即圓教也。	三、能詮所詮逆順本末皆無障礙，由稱法性直，譚不逐機，宜異說故，即圓教也。	01b	Third, the expounding and the expounded, going against and following the fundamental and the branches, are all unobstructed, due to directly discussing the Dharma nature and not following the different teachings for the faculties, which is the perfect teaching.

['ZH_T39_1795_01b:0537c25_16']	況此標為義本，如何不盡源流？	況此標為義本，如何不盡源流？	01b	Moreover, this is taken as the basis of the meaning. How can one not exhaust the source and flow?
