['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155a27_1']	破執我品第九之二若唯五取蘊名補特伽羅，何故世尊作如是說：	破執我品第九之二若唯五取蘊名補特伽羅，何故世尊作如是說：	030	Chapter 9, Part 2: Refuting the Attachment to the Self If only the five appropriated aggregates are called pudgala, why did the World-Honored One say:
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155a28_1']	吾今為汝說諸重擔、取捨重擔、荷重擔者。	吾今為汝說諸重擔、取捨重擔、荷重擔者。	030	I will now explain to you the heavy burden, the taking up of the heavy burden, and the one who bears the heavy burden.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155a28_10']	何緣於此佛不應說？	何緣於此佛不應說？	030	What reason is there for the Buddha not to speak of this?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155a29_1']	不應重擔即名能荷。	不應重擔即名能荷。	030	The heavy burden should not be called the bearer itself.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155a29_6']	所以者何？	所以者何？	030	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155a29_11']	曾未見故。	曾未見故。	030	Because it has never been seen.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b01_1']	不可說事亦不應說。	不可說事亦不應說。	030	What cannot be spoken of should also not be spoken of.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b01_6']	所以者何？	所以者何？	030	Why is this?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b01_11']	亦未見故。	亦未見故。	030	Because it has also never been seen.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b02_11']	又取重擔應非蘊攝，重擔自取，曾未見故。	又取重擔應非蘊攝，重擔自取，曾未見故。	030	Moreover, taking up the heavy burden should not be included in the aggregates, because the burden itself takes it up, and this has never been seen.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b04_1']	然經說愛名取擔者，既即蘊攝，荷者應然，即於諸蘊立數取趣。	然經說愛名取擔者，既即蘊攝，荷者應然，即於諸蘊立數取趣。	030	However, the sutra says that craving is called the one who takes up the burden. Since it is included in the aggregates, the bearer should be the same. The individual is established based on the aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b05_8']	然恐謂此補特伽羅是不可說常住實有，故此經後佛自釋言：	然恐謂此補特伽羅是不可說常住實有，故此經後佛自釋言：	030	However, fearing that this pudgala is an inexpressible, permanently abiding real entity, the Buddha himself explained after this sutra:
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b06_9']	但隨世俗，說此具壽有如是名，乃至廣說。	但隨世俗，說此具壽有如是名，乃至廣說。	030	But in accordance with worldly convention, it is said that this person has such and such a name, and so on.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b07_17']	如上所引人經文句，為令了此補特伽羅，可說無常非實有性。	如上所引人經文句，為令了此補特伽羅，可說無常非實有性。	030	The passage from the sūtra on humans cited above is to make it clear that this pudgala can be said to be impermanent, not that it really exists.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b08_12']	即五取蘊自相逼害得重擔名。	即五取蘊自相逼害得重擔名。	030	The five appropriated aggregates themselves are oppressed by their own characteristics and are called the heavy burden.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b09_16']	前前剎那引後後故名為荷者，故非實有補特伽羅。	前前剎那引後後故名為荷者，故非實有補特伽羅。	030	Because each preceding moment leads to the subsequent moment, it is called the bearer of the burden. Therefore, there is no really existing pudgala.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b11_7']	補特伽羅定應實有，以契經說諸有撥無化生有情邪見攝故。	補特伽羅定應實有，以契經說諸有撥無化生有情邪見攝故。	030	Pudgala must definitely really exist, because a sūtra says that those who deny the existence of sentient beings born through transformation are included in wrong views.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b11_16']	誰言無有化生有情？	誰言無有化生有情？	030	Who says that there are no sentient beings born through transformation?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b12_3']	如佛所言：	如佛所言：	030	As the Buddha said:
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b12_8']	我說有故。	我說有故。	030	Because I say they exist.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b13_9']	謂蘊相續能往後世，不由胎卵濕名化生有情。	謂蘊相續能往後世，不由胎卵濕名化生有情。	030	It means that the continuity of the aggregates can go to the next world, not by womb, egg, or moisture, but is called sentient beings born through transformation.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b14_1']	撥此為無，故邪見攝。	撥此為無，故邪見攝。	030	Denying their existence is therefore included in wrong views.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b14_11']	化生諸蘊，理實有故。	化生諸蘊，理實有故。	030	Because the aggregates born through transformation really exist.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b15_2']	又許此邪見謗補特伽羅。	又許此邪見謗補特伽羅。	030	Moreover, it is admitted that this wrong view denies pudgala.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b15_12']	汝等應言，是何所斷？	汝等應言，是何所斷？	030	You should say, which [kind of] elimination is it?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b15_17']	見修所斷。	見修所斷。	030	The person is neither eliminated by the path of insight nor by the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b17_1']	理並不然，補特伽羅非諦攝故，邪見不應修所斷故。	理並不然，補特伽羅非諦攝故，邪見不應修所斷故。	030	This is not reasonable, because the person is not included among the truths, and because wrong views are not eliminated by the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b19_12']	若謂經說有一補特伽羅生在世間，應非蘊者，亦不應理，此於總中假說一故，如世間說一麻一米一聚一言。	若謂經說有一補特伽羅生在世間，應非蘊者，亦不應理，此於總中假說一故，如世間說一麻一米一聚一言。	030	If you claim that the scripture that says that there is a person who is born in the world cannot refer to the aggregates, this is not reasonable, because the word one is used metaphorically in reference to the totality, just as one grain of sand, one grain of rice, one heap, one word.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b20_14']	或補特伽羅應許有為攝，以契經說生世間故。	或補特伽羅應許有為攝，以契經說生世間故。	030	Or else, you must admit that the person is included among the created dharmas, because a scripture says that it is born in the world.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b21_14']	非此言生如蘊新起，依何義說生在世間？	非此言生如蘊新起，依何義說生在世間？	030	This does not mean that it is born in the same way that the aggregates are newly created. In reference to what can it be said that it is born in the world?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b23_7']	依此今時取別蘊義，如世間說能祠者生、記論者生，取明論故。	依此今時取別蘊義，如世間說能祠者生、記論者生，取明論故。	030	It means that it is born in the sense that it now appropriates different aggregates, just as one says that a priest is born or a logician is born, because they have mastered certain scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b24_8']	又如世說有苾芻生、有外道生，取儀式故。	又如世說有苾芻生、有外道生，取儀式故。	030	Or else, it is like the expression, a bhikṣu is born or a heretic is born, because they have taken on certain observances.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b25_8']	或如世說有老者生，有病者生，取別位故。	或如世說有老者生，有病者生，取別位故。	030	Or else, it is like the expression, an old man is born or a sick man is born, because they are in a different state.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b25_18']	佛已遮故，此救不成。	佛已遮故，此救不成。	030	This is not a valid refutation, because the Buddha has already refuted this.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b26_7']	如勝義空契經中說：	如勝義空契經中說：	030	The Sūtra on the Emptiness of Ultimate Reality says:
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b27_1']	有業有異熟，作者不可得。	有業有異熟，作者不可得。	030	There is action and there is retribution, but the doer is not apprehended.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b27_18']	謂能捨此蘊，及能續餘蘊，唯除法假。	謂能捨此蘊，及能續餘蘊，唯除法假。	030	That is to say, the one who abandons this aggregate and who continues the other aggregates is only the designation of a dharma.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b28_4']	故佛已遮。	故佛已遮。	030	Therefore the Buddha has already refuted this.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b28_13']	頗勒具那契經亦說：	頗勒具那契經亦說：	030	The Sūtra for Pārāyaṇika also says:
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155b29_4']	我終不說有能取者。	我終不說有能取者。	030	I never say that there is a grasper.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c01_4']	故定無一補特伽羅能於世間取捨諸蘊。	故定無一補特伽羅能於世間取捨諸蘊。	030	Therefore there definitely is no pudgala that can grasp and abandon the aggregates in the world.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c02_3']	又汝所引祠者等生，其體是何而能喻此？	又汝所引祠者等生，其體是何而能喻此？	030	Also, what is the substance of the one born from the sacrifice that you cite as an analogy?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c02_13']	若執是我，彼不極成。	若執是我，彼不極成。	030	If you hold that it is a self, that is not established for you.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c03_13']	若心心所，彼念念滅、新新生故，取捨不成。	若心心所，彼念念滅、新新生故，取捨不成。	030	If it is mind and mental activities, they are momentary and newly born in each moment, and therefore grasping and abandoning are not established.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c04_3']	若許是身，亦如心等。	若許是身，亦如心等。	030	If you admit that it is the body, it is also like mind and so on.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c05_4']	又如明等與身有異，蘊亦應異補特伽羅。	又如明等與身有異，蘊亦應異補特伽羅。	030	Also, just as light and so on differ from the body, the aggregates must also differ from the pudgala.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c06_12']	老病二身各與前別，數論轉變如前已遣，故彼所引為喻不成。	老病二身各與前別，數論轉變如前已遣，故彼所引為喻不成。	030	The two bodies of old age and sickness are each different from the former. The Sāṃkhyas’ transformation has already been refuted above. Therefore the analogy that they cite is not established.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c07_12']	又許蘊生非數取趣，則定許此異蘊及常。	又許蘊生非數取趣，則定許此異蘊及常。	030	Also, if you admit that the aggregates are produced but not the pudgala, you must definitely admit that this pudgala is different from the aggregates and is eternal.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c08_12']	又此唯一，蘊體有五，寧不說此與蘊有異？	又此唯一，蘊體有五，寧不說此與蘊有異？	030	Also, if this pudgala is one and the substance of the aggregates is five, why not say that this pudgala is different from the aggregates?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c09_12']	大種有四，造色唯一，寧言造色不異大種？	大種有四，造色唯一，寧言造色不異大種？	030	The four great elements are four, but derivative form is one. Why do you say that derivative form is not different from the great elements?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c09_17']	是彼宗過。	是彼宗過。	030	This is an error in your theory.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c10_3']	何謂彼宗？	何謂彼宗？	030	What is this theory?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c10_12']	諸計造色即大種論。	諸計造色即大種論。	030	It is the theory of those who maintain that derivative form is the great elements.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c11_3']	設如彼見，應作是質：	設如彼見，應作是質：	030	If you hold this view, you should be questioned as follows:
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c12_5']	如諸造色即四大種，亦應即五蘊立補特伽羅。	如諸造色即四大種，亦應即五蘊立補特伽羅。	030	Just as derivative form is the four great elements, so also the pudgala should be established as the five aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c13_6']	若補特伽羅即諸蘊者，世尊何不記命者即身？	若補特伽羅即諸蘊者，世尊何不記命者即身？	030	If the pudgala is the aggregates, why did the World Honored One not answer that the life-principle is the body?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c13_15']	觀能問者阿世耶故。	觀能問者阿世耶故。	030	Because he considered the intention of the questioner.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c15_6']	問者執一內用士夫體實非虛名為命者，依此問佛與身一異。	問者執一內用士夫體實非虛名為命者，依此問佛與身一異。	030	The questioner held that there is a single internal active person whose substance is real and not empty, and he called this the life-principle. Based on this, he asked the Buddha whether it is the same as or different from the body.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c16_6']	此都無故，一異不成，如何與身可記一異？	此都無故，一異不成，如何與身可記一異？	030	Since this [pudgala] does not exist at all, sameness and difference are not established. How can it be said to be the same as or different from the body?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c17_8']	如不可記龜毛䩕軟，古昔諸師已解斯結。	如不可記龜毛䩕軟，古昔諸師已解斯結。	030	It is like the question of whether a turtle's hair is rough or smooth. The ancient masters have already unraveled this knot.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c18_8']	昔有大德名曰龍軍，三明六通具八解脫。	昔有大德名曰龍軍，三明六通具八解脫。	030	In the past, there was a great virtuous one named Nāgârjuna, who had the three insights, the six spiritual powers, and was endowed with the eight liberations.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c19_8']	于時有一畢隣陀王，至大德所作如是說：	于時有一畢隣陀王，至大德所作如是說：	030	At that time, there was a king named Pṛthivībandhu who went to where the great virtuous one was and said like this:
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c19_17']	我今來意欲請所疑。	我今來意欲請所疑。	030	I now come with the intention of asking about my doubts.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c20_18']	然諸沙門性好多語，尊能直答，我當請問。	然諸沙門性好多語，尊能直答，我當請問。	030	However, śramaṇas tend to speak a lot. If the Venerable One can answer directly, I will ask a question.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c21_4']	大德受請。	大德受請。	030	The great virtuous one accepted the request.

['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c23_8']	今何異言不答所問？	今何異言不答所問？	030	Why is it now that you answer differently and do not answer the question?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0155c23_13']	大德質曰：	大德質曰：	030	The great virtuous one asked in return:

['ZH_T29_1558_030:0156a01_6']	佛何不說命者都無？	佛何不說命者都無？	030	Why didn't the Buddha say that the life-force is completely non-existent?
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0156a01_15']	亦觀問者阿世耶故。	亦觀問者阿世耶故。	030	It is also because he observed the intention of the questioner.

['ZH_T29_1558_030:0156a03_16']	世尊若答命者都無，彼墮邪見，故佛不說。	世尊若答命者都無，彼墮邪見，故佛不說。	030	If the World-Honored One answered that the life-force is completely non-existent, he would fall into wrong views, so the Buddha did not say it.
['ZH_T29_1558_030:0156a05_1']	彼未能了緣起理故，非受正法器，不為說假有。	彼未能了緣起理故，非受正法器，不為說假有。	030	Because he has not yet understood the principle of dependent origination, he is not a vessel for receiving the true Dharma, and the Buddha did not tell him that it is provisionally existent.
