['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482b20_18']	此經玄音始唱歎佛智甚深，多寶讚善稱大慧平等，故文雖七軸宗歸一乘。	此經玄音始唱歎佛智甚深，多寶讚善稱大慧平等，故文雖七軸宗歸一乘。	When the profound sound of this sutra first resounds, it praises the Buddha's wisdom as being very profound. Multi-treasure praises goodness and calls the great wisdom equal. Therefore, although the text has seven scrolls, the main point returns to the One Vehicle.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482b23_11']	將欲顯一乘為真實，必須前明三乘為方便，若不前明三乘為方便，即不得顯一乘為真實。	將欲顯一乘為真實，必須前明三乘為方便，若不前明三乘為方便，即不得顯一乘為真實。	In order to manifest the One Vehicle as the truth, it is necessary to first explain the Three Vehicles as skillful means. If one does not first explain the Three Vehicles as skillful means, then one cannot manifest the One Vehicle as the truth.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482b24_8']	故此經云「開方便門示真實相」也。	故此經云「開方便門示真實相」也。	Therefore, this sutra says, Opening the gate of skillful means and revealing the true aspect.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482b25_12']	《注經》云「既唱擬一之端，宜前辨分三之意」，並其證也。	《注經》云「既唱擬一之端，宜前辨分三之意」，並其證也。	The commentary on the sutra says, Since the beginning of the intention to unify is proclaimed, it is appropriate to first discern the meaning of dividing into three. This is the evidence.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482b27_9']	釋名門者，外國稱傴和拘舍羅，傴和稱為方便，拘舍羅名為勝智，謂方便勝智也。	釋名門者，外國稱傴和拘舍羅，傴和稱為方便，拘舍羅名為勝智，謂方便勝智也。	As for the chapter on explaining the name, in a foreign country it is called upa-yakṣa-upāya, where upa is called skillful, and yakṣa-upāya is called supreme wisdom, referring to skillful supreme wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482b27_19']	但方便之名有離有合。	但方便之名有離有合。	However, the name skillful means has both separation and combination.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482b28_8']	所言離者凡有三義：	所言離者凡有三義：	As for separation, there are generally three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c01_7']	一者、就理教釋之，理正曰方，言巧稱便，即是其義深遠、其語巧妙，文義合舉故云方便。	一者、就理教釋之，理正曰方，言巧稱便，即是其義深遠、其語巧妙，文義合舉故云方便。	First, from the perspective of principle and teaching, principle is called fang, and skillful speech is called bian, which is the meaning of profound and far-reaching, and skillful and wonderful language. Since the text and meaning are combined, it is called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c02_1']	此釋通於大小，不專據三乘。	此釋通於大小，不專據三乘。	This explanation applies to both the great and small vehicles, not just based on the three vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c04_4']	二者、眾生所緣之域為方，如來適化之法稱便，蓋欲因病授藥，籍方施便，機教兩舉故名方便。	二者、眾生所緣之域為方，如來適化之法稱便，蓋欲因病授藥，籍方施便，機教兩舉故名方便。	Second, the realm of sentient beings' objects is called fang, and the Tathāgata's adaptive teaching is called bian. It is intended to prescribe medicine according to the illness, and use the method according to the situation. Since the teaching is based on the capacity, it is called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c04_18']	此亦通於大小，非專據於三乘。	此亦通於大小，非專據於三乘。	This also applies to both the great and small vehicles, not just based on the three vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c08_4']	三者、履嶮得安稱方，稟教獲利稱便，五濁之嶮非三乘則不安，故云履嶮得安，稟三乘教則便獲利，故以教為方以益為便，教益雙舉故云方便。	三者、履嶮得安稱方，稟教獲利稱便，五濁之嶮非三乘則不安，故云履嶮得安，稟三乘教則便獲利，故以教為方以益為便，教益雙舉故云方便。	Third, reaching safety when traversing treacherous paths refers to receiving the teaching and gaining benefits. The treacherous paths of the five turbidities cannot be traversed without the Three Vehicles, so it is said reaching safety when traversing treacherous paths. Receiving the teaching of the Three Vehicles then conveniently gains benefits, so the teaching is considered the path and the benefit is considered convenient. The teaching and benefit are both mentioned, so it is called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c08_17']	此亦通於大小，非專據三乘。	此亦通於大小，非專據三乘。	This also applies to both the Great and Small Vehicles, not just the Three Vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c09_7']	次合釋者凡有三義：	次合釋者凡有三義：	Next, the combined explanation has three meanings:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c10_5']	一者、方便是善巧之名，善巧者智用也。	一者、方便是善巧之名，善巧者智用也。	First, skillful means is the name for skillful wisdom, and skillful wisdom is the function of wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c11_4']	理實無三，以方便力是故說三，故名善巧。	理實無三，以方便力是故說三，故名善巧。	In reality there are not three, but because of the power of skillful means, therefore three are spoken of, so it is called skillful.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c11_6']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c11_17']	無三說三，云何名善巧？	無三說三，云何名善巧？	If there are not three but three are spoken of, how is it called skillful?
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c11_19']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c12_15']	由無三說三眾生遂得實益，故名善巧。	由無三說三眾生遂得實益，故名善巧。	Because of not three but three being spoken of, sentient beings thereby attain true benefit, so it is called skillful.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c12_17']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c13_13']	既得實益應名為實，云何乃言方便？	既得實益應名為實，云何乃言方便？	Since they attain true benefit, it should be called true, so why is it said to be skillful means?
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c13_15']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c15_5']	就益而言亦得稱實，今望理實無三假名說三，據理望教故名方便。	就益而言亦得稱實，今望理實無三假名說三，據理望教故名方便。	From the perspective of benefit, it can also be called true. Now, in terms of the truth of principle, there are no three vehicles, but they are provisionally taught as three. From the perspective of principle and teaching, they are therefore called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c16_19']	二者、說於三乘為令眾生悟入一乘，故此三乘為趣一乘之由漸，故名方便。	二者、說於三乘為令眾生悟入一乘，故此三乘為趣一乘之由漸，故名方便。	Second, the teaching of the three vehicles is for sentient beings to awaken and enter the One Vehicle. Therefore, these three vehicles are the gradual cause for entering the One Vehicle, and are therefore called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c19_2']	如下文云「我設是方便令得入佛慧」，又云「我此九部法入大乘為本」，故說三乘為一乘之方便也。	如下文云「我設是方便令得入佛慧」，又云「我此九部法入大乘為本」，故說三乘為一乘之方便也。	As the text below says, I set up this skillful means to enable them to enter the Buddha's wisdom, and also says, These nine divisions of my teachings enter the Mahayana as their basis. Therefore, the teaching of the three vehicles is a skillful means for the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c21_1']	三者、合前二義圓成一旨，所以無三說三者，欲令因三悟不三，是以二言合成一意也。	三者、合前二義圓成一旨，所以無三說三者，欲令因三悟不三，是以二言合成一意也。	Third, combining the previous two meanings to form a perfect and complete principle. The reason for teaching the three vehicles even though there are not three is to enable beings to awaken to the non-tripartism through the three. Therefore, the two statements combine to form a single meaning.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c21_11']	三乘方便有幾種？	三乘方便有幾種？	How many kinds of skillful means are there for the three vehicles?
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c21_13']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c21_18']	凡有三種：	凡有三種：	There are generally three kinds:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c22_18']	一、身方便，如現作二乘及垢衣長者、樹王之佛。	一、身方便，如現作二乘及垢衣長者、樹王之佛。	First, bodily skillful means, such as manifesting as the two vehicles, the dusty robe elder, or the Buddha of the king of trees.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c23_19']	二、口方便，則無三說三，謂虛指門外明有三車。	二、口方便，則無三說三，謂虛指門外明有三車。	Second, the expedient means of speech, which is the absence of the three statements of three, referring to the empty finger outside the gate indicating there are three carts.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c24_11']	三、意方便，則二思惟也：	三、意方便，則二思惟也：	Third, the expedient means of thought, which are the two contemplations:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c24_21']	一、思惟尋念過去佛；	一、思惟尋念過去佛；	First, contemplating and recollecting the Buddhas of the past;
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c25_9']	二、思惟我出濁惡世。	二、思惟我出濁惡世。	Second, contemplating that I have emerged in a defiled and evil world.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c26_16']	此則上同古佛下順眾生，二種因緣起方便智，謂意方便也。	此則上同古佛下順眾生，二種因緣起方便智，謂意方便也。	This is the upper same as the ancient Buddhas, the lower in accordance with sentient beings, the two kinds of causes and conditions arise expedient wisdom, which is the expedient means of thought.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c27_4']	同異門者，問：	同異門者，問：	As for the gate of sameness and difference, the question is asked:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c28_3']	舊亦明三乘為方便、一乘為真實，與今何異？	舊亦明三乘為方便、一乘為真實，與今何異？	The old also clarify that the three vehicles are expedient and the one vehicle is true, how is it different from now?
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c28_5']	答：	答：	The answer is:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c28_15']	今序經始終凡有四意：	今序經始終凡有四意：	Now, the preface of the sutra has four meanings in general:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0482c29_10']	一、以三乘為方便以、一乘為真實。	一、以三乘為方便以、一乘為真實。	First, taking the three vehicles as expedient and the one vehicle as true.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a03_1']	所以立此義者，昔稟教之人執三為實，不知三是方便，為欲行之故，明三是方便、一為真實，令捨三以入一乘也。	所以立此義者，昔稟教之人執三為實，不知三是方便，為欲行之故，明三是方便、一為真實，令捨三以入一乘也。	The reason for establishing this meaning is that people who received the teaching in the past took the three as real, not knowing that the three are expedient. In order to practice it, it is clarified that the three are expedient and the one is true, so that they may abandon the three and enter the one vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a05_10']	二者、稟教之徒雖復捨三遂封一實，麁惑雖去細染尋生，為對彼故明三之與一皆是方便、非三非一乃稱為實。	二者、稟教之徒雖復捨三遂封一實，麁惑雖去細染尋生，為對彼故明三之與一皆是方便、非三非一乃稱為實。	Second, even though those who receive the teaching may abandon the three and seal the one truth, coarse delusions may be removed but subtle defilements will arise again. In order to counter that, it is explained that the three and the one are all expedient means, and neither three nor one is called true.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a08_10']	三者、稟教之流乃識二是方便，更封兩非為理極，是故今明三一為二、非三非一名為不二，二與不二皆是方便、非二非不二乃是為真實。	三者、稟教之流乃識二是方便，更封兩非為理極，是故今明三一為二、非三非一名為不二，二與不二皆是方便、非二非不二乃是為真實。	Third, those who receive the teaching may recognize that the two are expedient means, but they may still seal the two negations as the ultimate principle. Therefore, it is now explained that the three and the one are two, and neither three nor one is called non-dual. Both the two and the non-dual are expedient means, and neither two nor non-dual is the true reality.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a10_17']	四者、二與不二乃至非二非不二猶是四句，未免名言，並稱方便，諸法寂滅相不可以言宣乃為真實也。	四者、二與不二乃至非二非不二猶是四句，未免名言，並稱方便，諸法寂滅相不可以言宣乃為真實也。	Fourth, the two and the non-dual, up to neither two nor non-dual, are still the four propositions, and have not yet escaped verbal expression, all being called expedient means. The quiescent and extinguished characteristic of all dharmas cannot be proclaimed with words, which is the true reality.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a12_3']	乘方便、乘真實既有四階，身方便、身真實亦有四句也。	乘方便、乘真實既有四階，身方便、身真實亦有四句也。	Since there are four levels of expedient means of the vehicle and true reality of the vehicle, there are also four propositions for expedient means of the body and true reality of the body.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a12_16']	一、以短為方便、長為真實。	一、以短為方便、長為真實。	First, taking the short as expedient means and the long as true reality.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a13_13']	二者、以長短並為方便、非長非短為真實。	二者、以長短並為方便、非長非短為真實。	Second, long and short are both expedient, and neither long nor short is the truth.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a15_8']	三者、長短為二、非長非短為不二，二與不二並是方便、非二非不二乃名真實。	三者、長短為二、非長非短為不二，二與不二並是方便、非二非不二乃名真實。	Third, long and short are two, and neither long nor short is non-dual. Dual and non-dual are both expedient, and neither dual nor non-dual is called the truth.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a17_13']	四者、二與不二非二非不二猶是四句，未離名言，並名方便，如來法身四句斯忘百非皆絕乃稱真實。	四者、二與不二非二非不二猶是四句，未離名言，並名方便，如來法身四句斯忘百非皆絕乃稱真實。	Fourth, dual, non-dual, neither dual nor non-dual are still four propositions, not yet free from words, all called expedient. The Dharma body of the Tathāgata forgets these four propositions and transcends a hundred negations, which is called the truth.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a19_5']	故〈壽量品〉釋法身云「非實非虛非如非異，具足十不」，如彼文說之。	故〈壽量品〉釋法身云「非實非虛非如非異，具足十不」，如彼文說之。	Therefore, the explanation of the Dharma body in the Chapter on Life-span says, Neither real nor false, neither so nor different, endowed with ten negations, as explained in that text.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a21_5']	通別門者，據別而言，正以三乘為方便，就通論之，方便是善巧為義，善巧通今昔也。	通別門者，據別而言，正以三乘為方便，就通論之，方便是善巧為義，善巧通今昔也。	As for the general and specific approach, based on the specific, it is precisely the three vehicles that are expedient. From the general perspective, expedient means skillful means. Skillful means extends to the present and the past.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a25_4']	今欲融會三一之所由，稱歎諸佛之善巧，所以然者，昔辨三教、今說一乘，前後相違義成鉾楯，則物不生信，故會釋云，所以昔三今一者，蓋是深照物機善巧施教，故不相違也。	今欲融會三一之所由，稱歎諸佛之善巧，所以然者，昔辨三教、今說一乘，前後相違義成鉾楯，則物不生信，故會釋云，所以昔三今一者，蓋是深照物機善巧施教，故不相違也。	Now, I wish to harmonize the reasons for the three and the one, and praise the skillful means of the buddhas. The reason for this is that the three teachings were distinguished in the past, and the One Vehicle is now taught. The meanings of the past and present contradict each other, like a spear and a shield, and people do not give rise to faith. Therefore, the reconciliation explains, The reason for the three in the past and the one now is that it is the skillful teaching bestowed by deeply illuminating the capacities of beings, and therefore there is no contradiction.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a26_12']	故方便是三一之總名，今昔之通稱，是以命初題「方便品」。	故方便是三一之總名，今昔之通稱，是以命初題「方便品」。	Therefore, skillful means is the general name for the three and the one, and the common term for the past and present. Thus, the first chapter is named Chapter on Skillful Means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a27_4']	但此義難明，今以四句顯之：	但此義難明，今以四句顯之：	However, this meaning is difficult to understand. Now, it is revealed using four statements:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a27_12']	一者、昔開今覆。	一者、昔開今覆。	First, in the past it was revealed, but now it is concealed.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a27_21']	謂昔開三、今覆三。	謂昔開三、今覆三。	It refers to revealing the three in the past, but concealing the three now.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a28_7']	二者、昔覆今開。	二者、昔覆今開。	Second, in the past it was concealed, but now it is revealed.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a28_16']	謂昔覆一、今開一。	謂昔覆一、今開一。	It refers to concealing the One in the past, but revealing the One now.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a29_2']	三者、今昔俱覆。	三者、今昔俱覆。	Third, in the past and present it is concealed together.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a29_10']	昔覆一、今覆三。	昔覆一、今覆三。	In the past it concealed the One, and now it conceals the three.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483a29_18']	四者、今昔俱開。	四者、今昔俱開。	Fourth, in the past and present it is revealed together.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b01_3']	昔開三、今開一。	昔開三、今開一。	In the past it revealed the three, and now it reveals the One.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b02_16']	所以有此四句者，皆是如來知機識法善巧為緣，無相違背，故悉名方便。	所以有此四句者，皆是如來知機識法善巧為緣，無相違背，故悉名方便。	The reason there are these four statements is that they are all the skillful means of the Tathāgata's knowledge of the capacities and understanding of the Dharma, without any contradiction, and are therefore all called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b03_6']	所以方便通今昔也。	所以方便通今昔也。	This is why skillful means extends to both the past and the present.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b03_17']	次舉無方便四句對顯之：	次舉無方便四句對顯之：	Next, the four statements of lacking skillful means are brought up to illustrate this:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b04_17']	一者、昔緣執三覆佛一，不知說三為開一。	一者、昔緣執三覆佛一，不知說三為開一。	First, in the past, clinging to the three concealed the Buddha's one, not knowing that the teaching of the three was to reveal the one.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b05_17']	二者、今緣執一覆佛三，不知雖一不失三。	二者、今緣執一覆佛三，不知雖一不失三。	Second, in the present, clinging to the one conceals the Buddha's three, not knowing that although there is one, the three are not lost.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b06_13']	三者、執自性三覆佛因緣之一三。	三者、執自性三覆佛因緣之一三。	Third, clinging to the three of intrinsic nature conceals the Buddha's one of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b07_9']	四者、執自性一覆佛因緣之三一。	四者、執自性一覆佛因緣之三一。	Fourth, clinging to the one of intrinsic nature conceals the Buddha's three of causes and conditions.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b08_11']	如此昔執皆是無方便，故無方便亦通今昔也。	如此昔執皆是無方便，故無方便亦通今昔也。	Such past clinging is all lacking skillful means, and therefore lacking skillful means also extends to both the past and the present.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b08_13']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b09_4']	何文明方便通今昔耶？	何文明方便通今昔耶？	What scriptures clarify that skillful means extends to both the past and the present?
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b09_6']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b12_15']	下三請文云「諸佛第一方便」，夫三乘是方便不名第一，一乘是第一不名方便，今言第一方便，則知是諸佛善巧智名第一方便，有此巧智故能說一三也。	下三請文云「諸佛第一方便」，夫三乘是方便不名第一，一乘是第一不名方便，今言第一方便，則知是諸佛善巧智名第一方便，有此巧智故能說一三也。	The text of the third request says the foremost skillful means of the buddhas. The three vehicles are skillful means and not called foremost, the One Vehicle is foremost and not called skillful means. Now, saying foremost skillful means, it is known that this is the buddhas' skillful wisdom called foremost skillful means. Because there is this skillful wisdom, it can expound the One and the Three.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b20_2']	如《百論》依空捨福，而《論》文云「用無相捨福」，釋言以是方便則能捨福，若捨有而滯空不名為方便，捨有不著空故名為方便。	如《百論》依空捨福，而《論》文云「用無相捨福」，釋言以是方便則能捨福，若捨有而滯空不名為方便，捨有不著空故名為方便。	As the Hundred Treatise relies on emptiness to abandon merit, the treatise text says using signlessness to abandon merit. The explanation says that by this skillful means one can abandon merit. If one abandons existence and becomes attached to emptiness, it is not called skillful means. Abandoning existence and not being attached to emptiness is called skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b22_9']	《智度論》云「破常而著無常名無方便無常，破常不著無常名有方便無常」，又云「破二不著一是名為法忍」。	《智度論》云「破常而著無常名無方便無常，破常不著無常名有方便無常」，又云「破二不著一是名為法忍」。	The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom says, Destroying permanence and becoming attached to impermanence is called having no skillful means and being impermanent. Destroying permanence and not being attached to impermanence is called having skillful means and being impermanent. It also says, Destroying duality and not being attached to oneness is called the acceptance of the Dharma.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0483b25_17']	所以然者，生死以取相為源，入道用無著為本，故下文云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著」。	所以然者，生死以取相為源，入道用無著為本，故下文云「我以無數方便引導眾生令離諸著」。	The reason for this is that birth and death take grasping at signs as its source, and entering the Way takes non-attachment as its basis. Therefore the text below says, I use countless skillful means to guide sentient beings, causing them to abandon all attachments.

Combining vehicles and opening wisdom, like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra generally saying that all vehicles enter the Great Vehicle, like the chapter on Uniting the Teachings says whether it is the Dharma of the Buddha, the Dharma of the bodhisattvas, or the Dharma of the two vehicles, they all enter the Mahāyāna, therefore it is called combining vehicles.

In this way, one and three, permanence and impermanence, up to the attachment to even a single hair, are all coarse dharmas and are not called wonderful.

Correct contemplation is subtle, therefore it is called the Wonderful Dharma. The Tathāgata uses this as his body, therefore it is called the Dharma Body. The Buddhas take this as their nature, therefore it is called Buddha-Nature. Being unique and independent, it is called the One Vehicle. There is no object that is not illuminated, therefore it is called Prajñā. There is no affliction that is not quiescent, therefore it is called Nirvāṇa. Therefore it is said, Prajñā is one Dharma, the Buddha speaks of it with various names, according to the various types of sentient beings, he establishes different names for it.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0485c10_11']	蓮華者以其臺葉具足如德無不圓，清淨無染如累無不盡，故云「是乘微妙清淨第一」，故以果乘為正。	蓮華者以其臺葉具足如德無不圓，清淨無染如累無不盡，故云「是乘微妙清淨第一」，故以果乘為正。	A lotus flower has a full platform and leaves, like virtues that are all perfect, and is pure and unstained, like afflictions that are all exhausted. Therefore, it is said to be this vehicle is subtle, pure, and supreme, so the fruit vehicle is taken as the main point.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0485c12_1']	因乘德猶未圓累未盡故不得稱妙，闕斯兩義故不得喻如蓮華也。	因乘德猶未圓累未盡故不得稱妙，闕斯兩義故不得喻如蓮華也。	The virtues of the causal vehicle are still not perfect and the afflictions are not yet exhausted, so it cannot be called wonderful. Lacking these two meanings, it cannot be likened to a lotus flower.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0485c14_5']	二者、初分之經正明二乘果是方便，故明一佛乘為真實，則令捨小果求大乘果，故明果乘為正也。	二者、初分之經正明二乘果是方便，故明一佛乘為真實，則令捨小果求大乘果，故明果乘為正也。	Second, the main point of the first part of the sutra is to clarify that the fruits of the two vehicles are expedient, so it clarifies the one Buddha vehicle as the truth, causing one to abandon the small fruit and seek the great fruit of the vehicle, so it clarifies the fruit vehicle as the main point.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0485c15_16']	既明一佛果乘，則以二乘之果攝屬因乘，令彼修於佛因以求佛果也。	既明一佛果乘，則以二乘之果攝屬因乘，令彼修於佛因以求佛果也。	Since it clarifies the fruition vehicle of a single Buddha, it includes the fruits of the two vehicles within the causal vehicle, causing them to cultivate the causes of Buddhahood in order to seek the fruition of Buddhahood.

However, the grasp of the three has been long-standing, and it has not yet been extensively clarified. For now, the three are briefly revealed and the one is manifested in order to shake the grasp and give rise to doubt.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0485c22_9']	稟教之流忽聞非常之說，故執動疑生、申疑致請。	稟教之流忽聞非常之說，故執動疑生、申疑致請。	Those who receive the teaching suddenly hear of the extraordinary teaching, and therefore the grasp shakes, doubt arises, and the doubts are presented and requests are made.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0485c24_17']	執動有可除之義，疑生有可解之理，既其有請故受請廣說，破彼三執、斷其一疑、生於信解，此一周說竟。	執動有可除之義，疑生有可解之理，既其有請故受請廣說，破彼三執、斷其一疑、生於信解，此一周說竟。	Holding that there is a meaning of removable agitation, and giving rise to doubt that there is a principle of resolvable confusion, since there was a request, the request was accepted and explained extensively, refuting those three attachments, severing that one doubt, and giving rise to faith and understanding. This first week of teaching is finished.

Now, in order to enlighten beings and cut off doubts, it praises the Buddha's two knowledges, which are not known by the two vehicles.

Sometimes it is only the wisdom of one fruition, called the wisdom of suchness, because in the causal stage, afflictions have not yet been exhausted and what is illuminated is not yet true, but on the fruition stage, there is no affliction that is not purified, so there is no wisdom that is not true.

However, ordinary beings, the two vehicles, and bodhisattvas are unable to fathom the source and bottom of the Buddha's wisdom, thus it is called extremely profound.

He does not say that there are actually three vehicles that are ultimate. You still insist on grasping the three vehicles as being ultimate, and therefore do not understand the Buddha's intention. Therefore, above it says, difficult to understand and difficult to enter.

As their narrow mind gradually changes, the Buddha ultimately teaches them the Mahayana. This person hears the Lotus Sutra and also has faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b05_4']	三者、本學大乘而後聞說大乘便退取小，如《大品》六十菩薩成羅漢。	三者、本學大乘而後聞說大乘便退取小，如《大品》六十菩薩成羅漢。	Third, those who originally studied the Mahayana but later heard the teaching of the Mahayana and then retreated to accept the lesser, like the sixty bodhisattvas in the Great Treatise who became arhats.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b06_2']	又至《涅槃經》，雖聞有佛性而猶成羅漢。	又至《涅槃經》，雖聞有佛性而猶成羅漢。	Moreover, in the Nirvana Sutra, although they heard about buddha-nature, they still became arhats.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b09_13']	四者、有始學小乘而終聞說大，此人多不生信，以其習小乘日久，若聞大乘乖其本心故不生信也。	四者、有始學小乘而終聞說大，此人多不生信，以其習小乘日久，若聞大乘乖其本心故不生信也。	Fourth, there are those who first study the Hinayana but eventually hear the teaching of the Mahayana. This type of person often does not give rise to faith, because they have been studying the Hinayana for a long time. If they hear the Mahayana, it goes against their original mind, so they do not give rise to faith.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b16_9']	所以明此四門者，靈山之會大機已熟應聞大法，故辨一乘真實門；	所以明此四門者，靈山之會大機已熟應聞大法，故辨一乘真實門；	The reason for explaining these four sections is that at the assembly on Vulture Peak, the great capacity was already ripe and should hear the great Dharma, so the section on the true vehicle of the One Vehicle is discussed;
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b17_14']	既示今一乘為真實，宜開昔三為方便，故辨三乘方便門。	既示今一乘為真實，宜開昔三為方便，故辨三乘方便門。	Since the present One Vehicle is shown to be true, it is appropriate to open the past three as expedient, so the section on the expedient vehicles of the three vehicles is discussed.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b21_1']	初門明今一乘真實，後門序昔三為方便，蓋是明一化始終理無不極，若能信一實三權則是得非失，如其不信則是失非得，故有第三得失門也。	初門明今一乘真實，後門序昔三為方便，蓋是明一化始終理無不極，若能信一實三權則是得非失，如其不信則是失非得，故有第三得失門也。	The first section clarifies the true vehicle of the One Vehicle in the present, and the latter section introduces the past three as expedient, which is the clarification of the principle of the beginning and end of the one teaching without omission. If one can believe in the one true and the three expedient, then it is gain and not loss. If one does not believe it, then it is loss and not gain, so there is the third section on gains and losses.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b22_8']	得失之理既彰，次勸捨失從得信受奉持，故有第四勸信門也。	得失之理既彰，次勸捨失從得信受奉持，故有第四勸信門也。	The principle of gains and losses being manifested, next it encourages abandoning loss and following gain, believing and upholding, so there is the fourth section on encouraging faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b24_14']	又有此四門者，一乘真實門謂根本法輪，諸佛出世但為明一大事因緣，謂一道清淨則根本法輪也。	又有此四門者，一乘真實門謂根本法輪，諸佛出世但為明一大事因緣，謂一道清淨則根本法輪也。	As for the four approaches, the first is the approach of the true one vehicle, which refers to the fundamental Dharma wheel. The reason why all Buddhas appear in the world is solely to elucidate the one great matter of the cause and effect of the path, which is the fundamental Dharma wheel.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b26_7']	但眾生薄福鈍根不堪受一道，是故於一佛乘方便說三，謂支末法輪。	但眾生薄福鈍根不堪受一道，是故於一佛乘方便說三，謂支末法輪。	However, because sentient beings have little merit and dull faculties, they are unable to accept the one path. Therefore, the one Buddha vehicle is expediently taught as the three, which are the branch Dharma wheels.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494b29_2']	既從一起三還欲令籍三通一，若能知三為歸一則是得非失，如其保三不受一是失而非得，故得失門明收末歸本法輪。	既從一起三還欲令籍三通一，若能知三為歸一則是得非失，如其保三不受一是失而非得，故得失門明收末歸本法輪。	Since the three arise from the one, it is still hoped that the three can lead to the one. If one can know that the three are for the sake of returning to the one, then it is a gain and not a loss. If one clings to the three and does not accept the one, then it is a loss and not a gain. Therefore, the approach of gain and loss clarifies the Dharma wheel of gathering the branches and returning to the root.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c01_12']	既序始終一化三輪事周，然後始得勸物信受，故有第四勸信門也。	既序始終一化三輪事周，然後始得勸物信受，故有第四勸信門也。	Having outlined the beginning and end of the three Dharma wheels in the one teaching, it is then possible to exhort beings to have faith and acceptance. Therefore, there is the fourth approach of exhorting faith.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c02_4']	就一乘真實門又開三別：	就一乘真實門又開三別：	Within the approach of the true one vehicle, there are also three distinctions:

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c03_12']	二、引諸佛證釋門；	二、引諸佛證釋門；	Second, the approach of citing the testimony of all Buddhas;

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c06_5']	所以有此三門者，釋迦當今教主故前自開宗，恐物不信故引諸佛為證，證明事竟然後始得順同也。	所以有此三門者，釋迦當今教主故前自開宗，恐物不信故引諸佛為證，證明事竟然後始得順同也。	The reason for these three approaches is that Shakyamuni is the current teacher, so he first opens his own doctrine. Fearing that people may not believe it, he cites the Buddhas as evidence. After verifying the matter, he then conforms with the same.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c06_15']	就初章之內又開三門：	就初章之內又開三門：	Within the first chapter, it is further divided into three approaches:

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c07_14']	三、顯教意門。	三、顯教意門。	Third, the approach of revealing the meaning of the teaching.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c08_18']	所以有此三門者，讚歎令生信解，不虛抑其誹謗，開解杜惑。	所以有此三門者，讚歎令生信解，不虛抑其誹謗，開解杜惑。	The reason for these three approaches is to praise and generate faith and understanding, to suppress false accusations, and to open up understanding and block delusions.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c09_11']	緣由既竟，故正明顯教意也。	緣由既竟，故正明顯教意也。	Since the conditions have ended, the correct meaning of the teaching is then revealed.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c12_9']	一者、體妙，謂非一非三言忘慮絕。	一者、體妙，謂非一非三言忘慮絕。	First, the wonderful essence, which is neither one nor three, beyond words and thoughts.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c13_17']	二者、用妙，非三非一，不知何以美之，為對昔三強歎為一。	二者、用妙，非三非一，不知何以美之，為對昔三強歎為一。	Second, the wonderful function is neither three nor one, and I do not know how to praise it. For the sake of opposing the old three, it is strongly praised as one.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c15_5']	故《注法華經》云「非三非一盡相為妙，非大非小通物為法」也。	故《注法華經》云「非三非一盡相為妙，非大非小通物為法」也。	Therefore, the commentary on the Lotus Sutra says, The wonderful appearance is neither three nor one, and the Dharma that penetrates all things is neither great nor small.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c15_18']	蓋是什肇舊宗，非今新釋也。	蓋是什肇舊宗，非今新釋也。	This is the old tenet of Kumārajīva and Jizang, not the new interpretation of today.

Therefore, it is known as rare.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0494c20_15']	「如優曇鉢華時一現耳」者，此譬上時乃說之言也。	「如優曇鉢華時一現耳」者，此譬上時乃說之言也。	Like the udumbara flower, which appears only once in a while, this metaphor illustrates the phrase it is only spoken at this time.

Therefore, the spiritual auspicious flower is a sign of the wheel-turning king, and the Lotus Sūtra is a portent of becoming a buddha.

The reason it is difficult to understand is because although the words are three, the meaning is not three. The words are near but the meaning is far, and this is why the meaning is difficult to understand.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495a11_10']	又意若住不三，亦不名難解，今言不三者，明其非是三，非謂是非三，斯則心無所寄乃契玄宗，故名難解。	又意若住不三，亦不名難解，今言不三者，明其非是三，非謂是非三，斯則心無所寄乃契玄宗，故名難解。	Moreover, if the mind abides in the non-three, it is also not called difficult to understand. Now, the statement not three clarifies that it is not the three, not that it is not the non-three. This means that when the mind has no reference point, it accords with the profound principle, and thus it is called difficult to understand.

This is because the capacities and natures of sentient beings are not the same, and each has their own reasons for entering the path, and thus it is said various causes and conditions.

The dharmas he expounds all reach the stage of omniscience. Those who receive the teachings of the Three Vehicles think and discriminate the Three, but they will never understand the meaning of the Three Teachings.

The next three phrases realize the previous principle and give rise to the three kinds of wisdom, therefore there is demonstrating, realizing, and entering.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b14_17']	所言「開」者，明無上義，唯除如來一切智能更無餘事，故言開佛知見，令眾生知得清淨故。	所言「開」者，明無上義，唯除如來一切智能更無餘事，故言開佛知見，令眾生知得清淨故。	As for what is said to be revealing, it clarifies the unsurpassed meaning. Except for the Tathāgata's omniscience, there is no other matter, therefore it is said to reveal the Buddha's wisdom and insight, causing sentient beings to know and attain purity.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b15_14']	如來知見者，謂如來能證如實義故。	如來知見者，謂如來能證如實義故。	The knowledge and vision of the Tathāgata refers to the Tathāgata's ability to realize the truth.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b18_10']	如〈壽量品〉云「如來如實知見三界之相，無有生死若退若出，亦無在世及滅度者，非實非虛非如非異」，此則如來法界也。	如〈壽量品〉云「如來如實知見三界之相，無有生死若退若出，亦無在世及滅度者，非實非虛非如非異」，此則如來法界也。	As the Chapter on the Duration of the Teaching says, The Tathāgata truly knows and sees the characteristics of the three realms, which have no birth and death, no regression or emergence, and also no existence or nirvāṇa. He is neither real nor false, neither as it seems nor different. This is the Dharma realm of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b19_12']	所言「示」者，明同義，謂聲聞、辟支佛及佛法身平等。	所言「示」者，明同義，謂聲聞、辟支佛及佛法身平等。	As for demonstration, it clarifies the meaning of sameness, referring to the equality of the Dharma bodies of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b20_10']	法身平等者，三乘佛性法身更無差別故。	法身平等者，三乘佛性法身更無差別故。	The equality of Dharma bodies means that the Dharma bodies of the buddhas of the three vehicles are no different.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b22_4']	所言「悟」者，明不知義，以二乘人不知究竟唯一佛乘，故今欲令知故言悟。	所言「悟」者，明不知義，以二乘人不知究竟唯一佛乘，故今欲令知故言悟。	As for realization, it clarifies the meaning of unknowing, because those of the two vehicles do not know that ultimately there is only the One Buddha Vehicle. Therefore, now wanting to make them know, it is said realization.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b23_6']	所言「入」者，為令證不退轉地示現與無量智業故。	所言「入」者，為令證不退轉地示現與無量智業故。	As for entry, it is in order to make them realize the stage of nonretrogression and manifest the bestowal of immeasurable wisdom and karmic activity.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b23_18']	詳論此意，四門則為次第：	詳論此意，四門則為次第：	In detail, the meaning of this is that the four gates are in sequence:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b24_14']	初明開佛知見，則歎佛知見為無上；	初明開佛知見，則歎佛知見為無上；	First, it clarifies the opening of the Buddha's wisdom and insight, praising the Buddha's wisdom and insight as unsurpassed;
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b27_15']	雖歎佛知見為無上，或謂獨佛有此知見二乘所無，是故第二次明三乘人同有佛性法身，但佛悟佛性故名法身，二乘猶隱故稱佛性；	雖歎佛知見為無上，或謂獨佛有此知見二乘所無，是故第二次明三乘人同有佛性法身，但佛悟佛性故名法身，二乘猶隱故稱佛性；	Although it praises the Buddha's wisdom and insight as unsurpassed, some may think that only the Buddha has this wisdom and insight, which the two vehicles lack. Therefore, the second time it clarifies that the people of the three vehicles equally possess Buddha-nature and the Dharma body. But because the Buddha awakens to Buddha-nature, it is called the Dharma body. The two vehicles are still hidden, so it is called Buddha-nature;
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495b29_16']	雖三乘人同有佛性法身，但二乘人不知唯有一乘無有二乘，今欲令知故次說悟佛知見；	雖三乘人同有佛性法身，但二乘人不知唯有一乘無有二乘，今欲令知故次說悟佛知見；	Although the people of the three vehicles equally possess Buddha-nature and the Dharma body, but the two vehicles do not know that there is only one vehicle and no second vehicle. Now, wanting to make them know, it next explains the awakening to the Buddha's wisdom and insight;
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c02_3']	既知唯一佛性無有二乘則證不退轉，故次說入佛知見。	既知唯一佛性無有二乘則證不退轉，故次說入佛知見。	Since they know that there is only one Buddha-nature and no second vehicle, they will attain irreversibility. Therefore, it next explains the entry into the Buddha's wisdom and insight.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c02_14']	《論》又兩番釋後三句：	《論》又兩番釋後三句：	The treatise also explains the last three sentences in two ways:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c03_14']	所言示者，為諸菩薩有疑心者令知如實修行故。	所言示者，為諸菩薩有疑心者令知如實修行故。	As for what is called demonstration, it is for the sake of those bodhisattvas who have doubts, wanting to make them know the true practice.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c05_3']	又復入者，未發菩提心者令發心故，已發心者令入大法故。	又復入者，未發菩提心者令發心故，已發心者令入大法故。	Moreover, as for entry, it is for the sake of those who have not yet given rise to the aspiration for enlightenment, wanting to make them give rise to the aspiration, and for those who have already given rise to the aspiration, wanting to make them enter the great Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c05_19']	又復入者，令捨聲聞果入大菩提故。	又復入者，令捨聲聞果入大菩提故。	Furthermore, entering means causing one to abandon the fruits of the śrāvakas and enter into great enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c06_14']	又復悟者，令外道眾生生覺悟故。	又復悟者，令外道眾生生覺悟故。	Furthermore, awakening means causing sentient beings of the non-Buddhist paths to give rise to enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c08_3']	此釋意與前異者，前四句並約化聲聞，今意明化菩薩及外道。	此釋意與前異者，前四句並約化聲聞，今意明化菩薩及外道。	The meaning of this explanation is different from the previous one. The previous four phrases are all about transforming the śrāvakas, while the present meaning clarifies transforming the bodhisattvas and non-Buddhists.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c09_15']	此經正化聲聞，次化菩薩并及外道，化此三人則總收一切令同歸佛乘也。	此經正化聲聞，次化菩薩并及外道，化此三人則總收一切令同歸佛乘也。	This sūtra correctly transforms the śrāvakas, next transforming the bodhisattvas and non-Buddhists. Transforming these three people comprehensively includes all and causes them to return to the Buddha's vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c11_17']	今次依《智度論》及《涅槃經》，言雖有四句不出二門，初之二句明能化門，後之二句明所化門。	今次依《智度論》及《涅槃經》，言雖有四句不出二門，初之二句明能化門，後之二句明所化門。	Next, relying on the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra and the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra, although there are four phrases, they do not go beyond two gates. The first two phrases clarify the gate of the able to transform, and the last two phrases clarify the gate of the transformed.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c13_13']	能化門中有大開之與曲示，所化門中有始悟之與終入，故此四門無義不攝。	能化門中有大開之與曲示，所化門中有始悟之與終入，故此四門無義不攝。	Within the gate of the able to transform, there is the great opening and the curved demonstration. Within the gate of the transformed, there is the initial awakening and the final entry. Therefore, these four gates encompass all meanings.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c14_14']	所言開者，眾生佛性名佛知見，佛性亦名一乘。	所言開者，眾生佛性名佛知見，佛性亦名一乘。	What is called opening is the Buddha's knowledge and insight, which is named the Buddha-nature of sentient beings, and the Buddha-nature is also called the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c15_6']	《涅槃經》言「畢竟有二種：	《涅槃經》言「畢竟有二種：	The Nirvana Sutra says, There are two kinds of ultimate:
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c15_20']	一者莊嚴畢竟，二者究竟畢竟。	一者莊嚴畢竟，二者究竟畢竟。	One is the ultimate of adornment, and the other is the ultimate of consummation.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c17_6']	莊嚴畢竟者謂六波羅蜜，究竟畢竟者一切眾生所得一乘。	莊嚴畢竟者謂六波羅蜜，究竟畢竟者一切眾生所得一乘。	The ultimate of adornment refers to the six perfections, and the ultimate of consummation is the One Vehicle attained by all sentient beings.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c19_11']	一乘者名為佛性，以是義故我說一切眾生悉有佛性、一切眾生悉有一乘，以無明覆故不能得見。	一乘者名為佛性，以是義故我說一切眾生悉有佛性、一切眾生悉有一乘，以無明覆故不能得見。	The One Vehicle is called Buddha-nature. For this reason, I say that all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature and all sentient beings possess the One Vehicle, but they cannot see it because it is covered by ignorance.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c21_18']	」為眾生故說佛性名之為開，既為眾生說則是為眾生開，所以開佛性者，令眾生除無明煩惱、使得清淨。	」為眾生故說佛性名之為開，既為眾生說則是為眾生開，所以開佛性者，令眾生除無明煩惱、使得清淨。	For the sake of sentient beings, the Buddha-nature is called 'revealed.' Since it is taught for the sake of sentient beings, it is 'revealed' for sentient beings. The reason for revealing the Buddha-nature is to enable sentient beings to eliminate ignorance and afflictions and attain purity.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c22_19']	開佛性，則是德無不圓，使得清淨謂累無不盡。	開佛性，則是德無不圓，使得清淨謂累無不盡。	Revealing the Buddha-nature means that virtues are all complete, and attaining purity means that all afflictions are exhausted.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c23_18']	所言示者，曲示五性差別之義，故名為示。	所言示者，曲示五性差別之義，故名為示。	As for 'demonstrating,' it means demonstrating the meaning of the distinctions between the five natures, and thus it is called 'demonstrating.'
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c25_3']	如《涅槃》云「掘出金藏故，普示眾生諸覺寶藏」，故名示也。	如《涅槃》云「掘出金藏故，普示眾生諸覺寶藏」，故名示也。	As the Nirvana Sutra says, Because it unearths the golden treasury, it universally reveals to sentient beings the treasury of enlightenment jewels, therefore it is called revealing.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c26_18']	所言悟者，大開曲示二門既竟，今次知有佛性名之為悟，修行證之故稱為入。	所言悟者，大開曲示二門既竟，今次知有佛性名之為悟，修行證之故稱為入。	As for understanding, after the two gates of greatly opening and revealing are finished, now next knowing that there is buddha-nature is called understanding, and cultivating and realizing it is called entering.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c28_4']	知有佛性謂十信以上也，證入佛性謂妙覺地已還也。	知有佛性謂十信以上也，證入佛性謂妙覺地已還也。	Knowing that there is buddha-nature refers to those above the ten stages of faith, and realizing and entering buddha-nature refers to those on the stage of wondrous enlightenment and below.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0495c28_13']	舉始及終位無不攝。	舉始及終位無不攝。	It includes all the stages from beginning to end.

['ZH_T34_1721_003:0496a06_14']	言一切種智者，雖知本來寂滅，於眾生常不寂滅，故於道未始二、於緣未始一。	言一切種智者，雖知本來寂滅，於眾生常不寂滅，故於道未始二、於緣未始一。	As for knowledge of all modes, although knowing the original quiescent extinction, it is always not quiescent extinction in sentient beings, therefore, the Way is never dual and the conditions are never singular.
['ZH_T34_1721_003:0496a07_6']	於道未始二，故六道常法身；	於道未始二，故六道常法身；	Since the Way is never dual, the six realms are always the Dharma body;
