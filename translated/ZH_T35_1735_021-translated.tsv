['ZH_T35_1735_021:0655c14_3']	謂圓成是依他體性，遍計但橫執依他，又迷真似現故，即依三性說三無性。	謂圓成是依他體性，遍計但橫執依他，又迷真似現故，即依三性說三無性。	021	That is to say, the perfect is the intrinsic nature of the other-dependent, and the imagined merely horizontally grasps the other-dependent. Moreover, it is because of delusion regarding the true and the appearance of the false. The three non-natures are explained based on the three natures.

Existence and non-existence are not two, forming the one true nature. Existence and non-existence negate each other, and nature is also not nature. Therefore, in the one dependent on others, one cultivates all contemplations.

If there were a place of coming, then it would already exist, like a bird coming to perch on a tree, how can it be said to be produced?
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0655c22_19']	次句因空。	次句因空。	021	The next line is the emptiness of causes.

['ZH_T35_1735_021:0655c27_14']	又初句非先有而生、次句非先無而生、次句非半有半無，三義各以末句息妄成觀。	又初句非先有而生、次句非先無而生、次句非半有半無，三義各以末句息妄成觀。	021	Moreover, the first sentence is not produced from what already exists, the second sentence is not produced from what does not exist beforehand, and the third sentence is not produced from half existing and half not existing. The three meanings each use the last sentence to cease delusion and accomplish contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0655c28_10']	次偈以無生釋無滅，略有三義：	次偈以無生釋無滅，略有三義：	021	The next verse uses non-arising to explain non-cessation, which has three meanings:

['ZH_T35_1735_021:0656a02_14']	後偈觀成利益，經云「無生即是佛」，故論云「若見因緣法，則為能見佛」，依他因緣即無生故。	後偈觀成利益，經云「無生即是佛」，故論云「若見因緣法，則為能見佛」，依他因緣即無生故。	021	The last verse observes the benefits of accomplishment. The sutra says, Non-arising is precisely the Buddha, therefore the treatise says, If one sees the principle of conditioned arising, then one is able to see the Buddha, because the other-dependent conditioned arising is precisely non-arising.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0656a04_18']	次二偈約依他兼修勝義無自性性觀中，前偈遣所觀，上半辨觀、下半明益，各含二義故致兼言。	次二偈約依他兼修勝義無自性性觀中，前偈遣所觀，上半辨觀、下半明益，各含二義故致兼言。	021	Next, the two verses are about the other-dependent, which also includes the contemplation of the superior ultimate nature of non-self. The first verse eliminates what is contemplated. The first half explains the contemplation, and the second half clarifies the benefits. Each contains two meanings, therefore it is said to be combined.

['ZH_T35_1735_021:0656a06_12']	所生法體從緣無性，即無所有。	所生法體從緣無性，即無所有。	021	the nature of the produced dharma is without essence due to conditions, thus it is non-existent.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0656a07_6']	此顯依他無生是圓成性益。	此顯依他無生是圓成性益。	021	This shows that the non-arising of the dependent is the benefit of the perfected nature.

['ZH_T35_1735_021:0656a09_8']	云深者，真性不立故。	云深者，真性不立故。	021	Why is it profound? Because the true nature is not established.

['ZH_T35_1735_021:0656a13_10']	二是正遣能了，既無所了亦無能了，能所兩亡為究竟解。	二是正遣能了，既無所了亦無能了，能所兩亡為究竟解。	021	Second, it directly dispels cognition. Since there is nothing to be cognized, there is also no cognition. The mutual absence of subject and object is the ultimate understanding.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0656a14_13']	後二偈明相無自性性觀中，初偈正明、後偈總結。	後二偈明相無自性性觀中，初偈正明、後偈總結。	021	The latter two verses clarify the observation of the nature of the absence of characteristics. The first verse clarifies it, and the latter verse concludes it.

['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c21_1']	後五業相無依成事喻，喻佛難思現用德，於中二，三偈喻、二偈合。	後五業相無依成事喻，喻佛難思現用德，於中二，三偈喻、二偈合。	021	The latter five metaphors of the characteristics of karma without support and accomplishing things illustrate the Buddha's inconceivable virtue of present function. Within this, there are two parts: three verses of metaphor and two verses of combination.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c21_12']	前中，初一明業果互依。	前中，初一明業果互依。	021	In the former, the first verse clarifies the mutual support of karma and its fruits.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c23_2']	次偈明相依無性，業不離生故業性空，因業有生故生無來處。	次偈明相依無性，業不離生故業性空，因業有生故生無來處。	021	The next verse clarifies that the mutual support is without nature. Since karma is not apart from arising, the nature of karma is empty. Because there is arising due to karma, arising has no place of coming.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c23_14']	後偈雙結難思，顯成真觀。	後偈雙結難思，顯成真觀。	021	The last verse concludes the inconceivability and manifests true contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c25_10']	若逆推其本，業復有因卒至無住，無住無本故無所見，無見之見方了業空。	若逆推其本，業復有因卒至無住，無住無本故無所見，無見之見方了業空。	021	If one traces back to its origin, karma also has a cause that suddenly arrives without abiding. Since there is no abiding and no origin, there is nothing to be seen. The seeing of non-seeing is precisely understanding the emptiness of karma.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c26_9']	二頌合中，初偈難思普應，合上業果互依。	二頌合中，初偈難思普應，合上業果互依。	021	In the two verses of combination, the first verse combines the mutual support of karma and its fruits with the inconceivability and universal response.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c27_5']	次二句以互不相是，合互依無性。	次二句以互不相是，合互依無性。	021	The next two lines combine the mutual non-nature with the mutual non-nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c27_19']	身若是佛，轉輪王等即是如來；	身若是佛，轉輪王等即是如來；	021	If the body were the Buddha, wheel-turning kings and so forth would be the Tathagata;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c28_13']	佛若是身，正覺之心應同色相。	佛若是身，正覺之心應同色相。	021	If the Buddha were the body, the mind of right enlightenment should be the same as form and appearance.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0657c29_16']	後二句結示真體唯如唯智，合第三偈難思達本。	後二句結示真體唯如唯智，合第三偈難思達本。	021	The last two lines conclude by indicating that the true essence is only thusness and only cognition, combining with the third verse to reach the unfathomable source.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a02_9']	二有三偈明見實中，初頌見佛即了法，以見佛稱性，不疑同體故。	二有三偈明見實中，初頌見佛即了法，以見佛稱性，不疑同體故。	021	In the second section, there are three verses on seeing reality. The first verse says seeing the Buddha is understanding the Dharma, because seeing the Buddha accords with the essence and there is no doubt about the same essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a03_12']	次偈見法即見佛，了法即性淨，知佛不住性相故。	次偈見法即見佛，了法即性淨，知佛不住性相故。	021	The next verse says seeing the Dharma is seeing the Buddha, because understanding the Dharma is the pure essence, and knowing the Buddha does not abide in essence or characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a05_2']	後偈明了正修行，照了無相心寂分別，寂照雙流故名正念。	後偈明了正修行，照了無相心寂分別，寂照雙流故名正念。	021	The last verse clarifies the correct practice, illuminating the signless mind, tranquil and discriminating, with tranquil illumination flowing together, called correct mindfulness.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a05_14']	則從佛法生，是法王子故。	則從佛法生，是法王子故。	021	Then it arises from the Buddha's Dharma, because it is the Dharma Prince.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a07_10']	又上三偈，初知離名為法、次知法名為佛、後知無名為僧，窮見三寶之實體也。	又上三偈，初知離名為法、次知法名為佛、後知無名為僧，窮見三寶之實體也。	021	Moreover, the above three verses first know leaving names is the Dharma, next know knowing the Dharma is the Buddha, and later know non-existence is the Sangha, exhausting the true essence of seeing the Three Jewels.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a08_4']	第九照心本末名為覺林。	第九照心本末名為覺林。	021	The ninth is illuminating the mind's origin and end, called the forest of enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a08_18']	十頌顯於具分唯識，大分為二：	十頌顯於具分唯識，大分為二：	021	Ten verses reveal the complete aspect of consciousness only, divided into two main parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a09_13']	前五約喻顯法、後五法合成觀。	前五約喻顯法、後五法合成觀。	021	The first five use analogies to illustrate the Dharma, and the last five synthesize the Dharma into contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a09_17']	前中二：	前中二：	021	Within the first, there are two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a10_8']	前二約事、後三約心。	前二約事、後三約心。	021	The first two are about phenomena, the latter three are about mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a11_4']	乍觀此喻，似前喻所作、後喻能作；	乍觀此喻，似前喻所作、後喻能作；	021	At first glance, this metaphor seems to show the former as that which is produced and the latter as that which produces;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a12_9']	細尋喻意，前喻却親，故喻真妄依持、後喻心境依持。	細尋喻意，前喻却親，故喻真妄依持、後喻心境依持。	021	but if one carefully considers the meaning of the metaphor, the former metaphor is actually more intimate, so it illustrates the support of the true and false, while the latter metaphor illustrates the support of mind and objects.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a15_2']	然依生滅八識但有心境依持，而即如來藏心故有真妄依持，以會緣入實差別相盡唯真如門，即前喻所顯；	然依生滅八識但有心境依持，而即如來藏心故有真妄依持，以會緣入實差別相盡唯真如門，即前喻所顯；	021	However, in the eight consciousnesses that arise and cease, there is only the support of mind and objects, but because they are the mind of the Tathāgata's essence, there is the support of the true and false. By unifying conditions and entering reality, all distinctions of characteristics are exhausted, which is the gate of true suchness, which is illustrated by the former metaphor;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a16_3']	攝境從心不壞相故是生滅門，即後喻所明。	攝境從心不壞相故是生滅門，即後喻所明。	021	absorbing objects into mind and not destroying characteristics is the arising and ceasing gate, which is illustrated by the latter metaphor.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a17_11']	存壞不二、唯一緣起，二門無礙唯是一心，故下合中但明心造；	存壞不二、唯一緣起，二門無礙唯是一心，故下合中但明心造；	021	Preservation and destruction are not two, but are a single dependent arising. The two gates are unobstructed and are only one mind. Therefore, in the following synthesis, it only clarifies that mind produces.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a18_9']	欲分義別，喻顯二門，是名具分唯識。	欲分義別，喻顯二門，是名具分唯識。	021	If one wishes to distinguish the separate meanings, the metaphors illustrate the two gates. This is called the complete form of consciousness only.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a19_9']	今初，二偈真妄依持即真如門，攝一切法也。	今初，二偈真妄依持即真如門，攝一切法也。	021	Now, the first two verses on the support of the true and false are the gate of true suchness, which includes all dharmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a22_1']	初偈，初句總喻一心、次句喻隨緣熏變成依他也、次句不了依他故成遍計、第四句喻依他相盡體即圓成。	初偈，初句總喻一心、次句喻隨緣熏變成依他也、次句不了依他故成遍計、第四句喻依他相盡體即圓成。	021	The first verse: the first line is a general metaphor for the one mind, the next line metaphors the transformation of becoming the dependent on conditions, the next line is not understanding the dependent, therefore becoming the universal, the fourth line metaphors the exhaustion of the characteristics of the dependent, the essence is the perfect.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a24_5']	後偈喻依圓真妄非即離義，上半不即能所異故、大種中無色身所觸故、色中無大種眼所見故。	後偈喻依圓真妄非即離義，上半不即能所異故、大種中無色身所觸故、色中無大種眼所見故。	021	The later verse metaphors the meaning of the perfect and true, the false not being identical or separate. The upper half is not identical because the subject and object are different, because the great elements do not have the body that is touched, and because the form does not have the great elements that are seen by the eyes.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a25_15']	又能造無異畫色差別故、喻妄依真能所異故、性無差別相不同故。	又能造無異畫色差別故、喻妄依真能所異故、性無差別相不同故。	021	Moreover, the creator does not have the difference of the painted form, metaphorically the false depending on the true, the subject and object are different, therefore, the nature is without difference, the characteristics are not the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a28_3']	下半不離義，謂所造青等離能造地等無別體故、假必依實同聚現故、喻妄必依真性相交徹故。	下半不離義，謂所造青等離能造地等無別體故、假必依實同聚現故、喻妄必依真性相交徹故。	021	The lower half is the meaning of not being separate. It is said that the created blue, etc. is separate from the creator, the great elements, and does not have a separate essence. The false must depend on the true, the nature and characteristics interpenetrate.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658a29_15']	然大必能造色，非色能造大，喻妄必依真起，真不依妄生，故不云也。	然大必能造色，非色能造大，喻妄必依真起，真不依妄生，故不云也。	021	However, the great elements must be able to create form, and form cannot create the great elements. The false must depend on the true to arise, the true does not depend on the false to be born, therefore it is not said.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b01_8']	然不離於色，有大種可得。	然不離於色，有大種可得。	021	However, apart from the colors, the great elements can still be obtained.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b02_5']	後三約心者，喻於唯識心生滅門。	後三約心者，喻於唯識心生滅門。	021	The last three are about the mind, which is a metaphor for the mind and its arising and ceasing in the only-consciousness doctrine.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b03_15']	於中，初一亦明心境不即離義，上半不即，心中無彩畫，不可見故。	於中，初一亦明心境不即離義，上半不即，心中無彩畫，不可見故。	021	Among them, the first one also clarifies the meaning of the mind and objects not being identical or separate. The upper half is not identical. There is no painting in the mind because it cannot be seen.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b04_17']	彩畫中無心，無慮知故，喻能變所變見相別故。	彩畫中無心，無慮知故，喻能變所變見相別故。	021	There is no mind in the painting because it has no thoughts. The metaphor is that the seeing and appearances of the transforming and the transformed are separate.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b06_1']	下半不離，隨心安布故，喻離心則無境界相故。	下半不離，隨心安布故，喻離心則無境界相故。	021	The lower half is not separate. Because it is arranged according to the mind, the metaphor is that apart from the mind, there are no appearances of objects.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b07_6']	要由心變於境，非是境能變心，故云唯識，不言唯境；	要由心變於境，非是境能變心，故云唯識，不言唯境；	021	It is only because the mind transforms the objects, not because the objects can transform the mind. Therefore, it is said to be only consciousness, not only objects;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b08_14']	但云然不離於心有彩畫可得，不言然不離於畫而有心可得。	但云然不離於心有彩畫可得，不言然不離於畫而有心可得。	021	It is only said that apart from the mind, the painting can still be obtained, not that apart from the painting, the mind can still be obtained.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b10_2']	次一偈喻能所變之行相，明畫師巧思不住，變態多端。	次一偈喻能所變之行相，明畫師巧思不住，變態多端。	021	The next verse is a metaphor for the characteristics of the transforming and the transformed. It clarifies that the skillful thoughts of the painter do not abide, and the changes are numerous.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b10_14']	所畫非心誰相知者，法合。	所畫非心誰相知者，法合。	021	Who knows the characteristics of the painting that is not the mind? The Dharma is combined with this.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b11_5']	彼心者，真妄和合心也。	彼心者，真妄和合心也。	021	That mind refers to the mind that is a combination of the true and the false.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b12_1']	恒言遮斷，不住遮常，如瀑流故。	恒言遮斷，不住遮常，如瀑流故。	021	The word always excludes cessation, and abiding excludes permanence, because it is like a rushing stream.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b12_12']	含一切種，故云無量相。	含一切種，故云無量相。	021	Because it contains all seeds, it is said to have immeasurable characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b13_1']	甚深細，名難思議。	甚深細，名難思議。	021	Being very deep and subtle, it is called difficult to conceive.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b13_8']	次句頓現萬境。	次句頓現萬境。	021	The next line suddenly manifests myriad realms.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b14_1']	下句喻所變境離心無體。	下句喻所變境離心無體。	021	The last line uses a metaphor to show that the transformed realms have no substance apart from the mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b14_13']	又常不住者，無住為本故。	又常不住者，無住為本故。	021	Moreover, always not abiding means that non-abiding is the basis.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b15_3']	無量難思，總標深廣。	無量難思，總標深廣。	021	Immeasurable and difficult to conceive generally indicates its profundity and vastness.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b15_18']	下二句釋，示現一切，廣故難思；	下二句釋，示現一切，廣故難思；	021	The next two lines explain and demonstrate all, which is vast and therefore difficult to conceive;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b16_7']	各不相知，深故難思。	各不相知，深故難思。	021	each not knowing the other, it is profound and therefore difficult to conceive.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b16_20']	三一偈，重喻上來不相知義。	三一偈，重喻上來不相知義。	021	The next three lines reiterate the meaning of mutual non-knowing above.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b18_4']	謂非唯所畫之法自不相知，喻所變之境無有體性。	謂非唯所畫之法自不相知，喻所變之境無有體性。	021	It means that not only do the painted phenomena themselves not know each other, the metaphor shows that the transformed realms have no substance.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b20_5']	能畫之心念念生滅，自不相知故，亦不能知於所畫，雙喻心境皆無自性，各不相知故。	能畫之心念念生滅，自不相知故，亦不能知於所畫，雙喻心境皆無自性，各不相知故。	021	The painting mind arises and ceases moment by moment, and itself does not know itself, therefore it also cannot know what is painted, the double metaphor shows that both mind and objects have no self-nature and do not know each other.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b20_18']	言不能知自心，而由心故畫。	言不能知自心，而由心故畫。	021	It is said that the mind cannot know itself, but it is because of the mind that it draws.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b22_9']	又雖不知畫心，而由心能畫，喻眾生雖迷心現量，而心變於境。	又雖不知畫心，而由心能畫，喻眾生雖迷心現量，而心變於境。	021	Moreover, although it does not know the mind that draws, it is because of the mind that it can draw, which is analogous to sentient beings, although deluded about the mind's direct experience, the mind transforms the objective realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b24_6']	又由不能知所畫，但畫於自心，故能成所畫，喻眾生由迷境，唯心方能現妄境。	又由不能知所畫，但畫於自心，故能成所畫，喻眾生由迷境，唯心方能現妄境。	021	Moreover, because it cannot know what is drawn, it only draws its own mind, and therefore it can accomplish what is drawn, which is analogous to sentient beings, because of delusion about the objective realm, the mind only manifests false objects.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b25_7']	又喻正由無性方成萬境，故云諸法性如是。	又喻正由無性方成萬境，故云諸法性如是。	021	Moreover, the analogy is precisely because of having no nature that myriad realms are accomplished, and therefore it is said that the nature of all dharmas is like this.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b25_16']	第二五偈合中分四：	第二五偈合中分四：	021	The second five verses are divided into four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b26_2']	初一偈合。	初一偈合。	021	The first verse is the synthesis.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b27_2']	初二句，初句合最初句心者，即總相之心也。	初二句，初句合最初句心者，即總相之心也。	021	The first two lines, the first line synthesizes the first line mind, which is the mind of general characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b28_4']	下三句合第二句諸世間者，即諸彩色，此句為總。	下三句合第二句諸世間者，即諸彩色，此句為總。	021	The next three lines synthesize the second line all worldly realms, which is the various colors, and this line is the general one.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b29_3']	下出諸相，即蘊界處，故云無法不造故。	下出諸相，即蘊界處，故云無法不造故。	021	The following brings out the various characteristics, which are the aggregates, realms, and sense bases, and therefore it says there is no dharma that is not created.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658b29_19']	晉譯云造種種五蘊，《正法念》云：	晉譯云造種種五蘊，《正法念》云：	021	The Jin translation says creating the various five aggregates. The Samantapāsādikā says:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c02_9']	心如畫師手，畫出五彩，黑青赤黃白及白白，故上文云「布諸彩色」。	心如畫師手，畫出五彩，黑青赤黃白及白白，故上文云「布諸彩色」。	021	The mind is like a painter's hand, painting out the five colors - black, blue, red, yellow, white, and pure white, thus the above text says spreading out the various colors.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c03_13']	畫手，譬心六色，如次喻地獄、鬼、畜、修羅、人、天。	畫手，譬心六色，如次喻地獄、鬼、畜、修羅、人、天。	021	The painting hand is a metaphor for the mind's six colors, which in turn are compared to the hells, hungry ghosts, animals, asuras, humans, and gods.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c04_8']	若言種種則十法界，五蘊等法皆心所造。	若言種種則十法界，五蘊等法皆心所造。	021	If it is said to be various, then the ten dharma realms, the five aggregates, and so forth are all created by the mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c05_3']	次二頌合前初偈下半，於中二：	次二頌合前初偈下半，於中二：	021	Next, two verses combine the latter half of the first verse. Within this, there are two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c06_14']	初一舉例以合，由成前諸言，謂如世五蘊從心而造，諸佛五蘊亦然。	初一舉例以合，由成前諸言，謂如世五蘊從心而造，諸佛五蘊亦然。	021	First, one verse raises an example to combine, based on the previous words, which means that just as the worldly five aggregates are created from the mind, the five aggregates of the buddhas are also like this.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c07_14']	如佛五蘊，餘一切眾生亦然，皆從心造。	如佛五蘊，餘一切眾生亦然，皆從心造。	021	As with the five aggregates of the buddhas, all other sentient beings are also like this, all created from the mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c08_9']	然心是總相，悟之名佛，成淨緣起；	然心是總相，悟之名佛，成淨緣起；	021	However, the mind is the general characteristic. Understanding it is called buddhahood, forming pure dependent arising;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c09_1']	迷作眾生，成染緣起。	迷作眾生，成染緣起。	021	Delusion creates sentient beings, forming defiled dependent arising.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c10_13']	緣起雖有染淨，心體不殊，佛果契心同真無盡，妄法有極故不言之。	緣起雖有染淨，心體不殊，佛果契心同真無盡，妄法有極故不言之。	021	Although dependent arising has defilement and purity, the essence of the mind is not different. The Buddha's fruition accords with the mind, the same as the inexhaustible truth. Deluded dharmas have an end, so it is not said of them.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c11_12']	若依舊譯，云心佛與眾生，是三無差別。	若依舊譯，云心佛與眾生，是三無差別。	021	If based on the old translation, it says mind, Buddha, and sentient beings, these three are no different.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c12_8']	則三皆無盡，無盡即是無別之相。	則三皆無盡，無盡即是無別之相。	021	Then all three are inexhaustible. Inexhaustible is precisely the characteristic of no difference.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c13_4']	應云心佛與眾生，體性皆無盡。	應云心佛與眾生，體性皆無盡。	021	It should be said mind, Buddha, and sentient beings, their essence is all inexhaustible.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c14_13']	以妄體本真故亦無盡，是以如來不斷性惡，亦猶闡提不斷性善。	以妄體本真故亦無盡，是以如來不斷性惡，亦猶闡提不斷性善。	021	Because the essence of delusion is originally true, it is also inexhaustible. Therefore, the Tathāgata does not cut off the nature of evil, just as the icchantika does not cut off the nature of goodness.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c15_3']	又上三各有二義：	又上三各有二義：	021	Moreover, each of the above three has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c15_15']	總心二義者，一染、二淨。	總心二義者，一染、二淨。	021	The two meanings of mind are: first, defilement; second, purity.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c16_11']	佛二義者，一應機隨染、二平等違染。	佛二義者，一應機隨染、二平等違染。	021	The two meanings of Buddha are: first, responding to capacities and following defilement; second, equality and contradicting defilement.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c17_8']	眾生二者，一隨流背佛、二機熟感佛。	眾生二者，一隨流背佛、二機熟感佛。	021	The two of sentient beings are: first, following the current and turning one's back on the Buddha; second, when capacities are ripe, one arouses the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c19_2']	各以初義成順流無差，各以後義為反流無差，則無差之言含盡無盡。	各以初義成順流無差，各以後義為反流無差，則無差之言含盡無盡。	021	Each uses the first meaning to form the non-difference of following the current, and each uses the latter meaning as the non-difference of going against the current. Then the words no difference contain both the inexhaustible and the exhausted.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c20_3']	又三中二義，各全體相收，此三無差成一緣起。	又三中二義，各全體相收，此三無差成一緣起。	021	Moreover, within the three, the two meanings each completely include the essence of the other, and these three are without distinction, forming one dependent origination.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c20_8']	上約橫論。	上約橫論。	021	Above, it is discussed horizontally.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c22_4']	若約一人，心即總相，佛即本覺、眾生即不覺，乃本覺隨緣而成此二，為生滅門；	若約一人，心即總相，佛即本覺、眾生即不覺，乃本覺隨緣而成此二，為生滅門；	021	If it is discussed in terms of one person, mind is the general characteristic, Buddha is original enlightenment, and sentient beings are non-enlightenment. This is original enlightenment following conditions to form these two, which is the door of arising and ceasing;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c23_16']	下半此二體性無盡，即真如門，隨緣不失自真性故，正合前文大種無差。	下半此二體性無盡，即真如門，隨緣不失自真性故，正合前文大種無差。	021	The lower half of this verse states that the essence of these two is inexhaustible, which is the door of suchness, because following conditions does not lose one's true nature. It directly corresponds to the previous text that the great elements are without distinction.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c25_1']	若謂心佛眾生三有異者，即是虛妄取異色也。	若謂心佛眾生三有異者，即是虛妄取異色也。	021	If it is said that the three, mind, Buddha, and sentient beings, are different, then this is a false grasping of difference in form.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c27_1']	後一偈反勢合，謂妄取異色則不知心行，若知心行普造世間則無虛妄，便了真實。	後一偈反勢合，謂妄取異色則不知心行，若知心行普造世間則無虛妄，便了真實。	021	The last verse combines the two meanings in reverse order. It states that if one falsely grasps difference in form, then one does not know the activity of the mind. If one knows the activity of the mind that universally creates the world, then there is no falsehood, and one will understand the truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c27_14']	即正合大種無差，兼明觀益。	即正合大種無差，兼明觀益。	021	This directly corresponds to the great elements being without distinction, and it also clarifies the benefits of contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0658c28_2']	三一偈有二義：	三一偈有二義：	021	The third verse has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a01_6']	一雙合前真妄心境不即離義，上半合前二三偈之上半，即前互無不即之義，心即能變及心體故。	一雙合前真妄心境不即離義，上半合前二三偈之上半，即前互無不即之義，心即能變及心體故。	021	The first couplet combines the previous meaning of the true and false mind and objects not being identical or separate. The first half combines the first three and a half verses, which is the meaning of mutual absence not being identical, because the mind is the transformer and the essence of the mind.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a02_6']	身即所變，謂有根身是識相分及性之相故。	身即所變，謂有根身是識相分及性之相故。	021	The body is the transformed, referring to the body with faculties, which is the appearance portion and the characteristics of the consciousness.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a04_14']	下半雙合前兩偈下半不離之義，謂雖不相住，而依心現境，依體起用作諸佛事，體用不礙，為未曾有。	下半雙合前兩偈下半不離之義，謂雖不相住，而依心現境，依體起用作諸佛事，體用不礙，為未曾有。	021	The second half combines the meaning of non-separation in the second half of the two previous verses, which means that although they do not abide in each other, the objects appear based on the mind, and the function arises based on the essence to perform the Buddha's work. The essence and function are unobstructed, which is unprecedented.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a06_14']	二又將合前第四偈，謂上半合前恒不住義，及各不相知而能作佛事，合示現一切色。	二又將合前第四偈，謂上半合前恒不住義，及各不相知而能作佛事，合示現一切色。	021	Second, it will combine the fourth verse, which means that the first half combines the meaning of always not abiding and each not knowing each other but being able to perform the Buddha's work, combining to show all forms.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a08_11']	自在未曾有，合無量難思議，為兼此義，不以互無言之而言不住，譯之妙也；	自在未曾有，合無量難思議，為兼此義，不以互無言之而言不住，譯之妙也；	021	The freedom and unprecedented combine the immeasurable and difficult to conceive, which is also included in this meaning. It does not use the words of mutual absence but speaks of not abiding. The translation is wonderful;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a09_12']	晉經但云心亦非是身，但得前文互無之義。	晉經但云心亦非是身，但得前文互無之義。	021	The Jin text only says that the mind is also not the body, and only obtains the meaning of mutual non-existence in the previous text.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a10_10']	末後一偈結勸，即反合前畫師不知心喻。	末後一偈結勸，即反合前畫師不知心喻。	021	The last verse concludes with an exhortation, which is a reverse combination of the painter not knowing the mind metaphor.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a11_2']	若不知心，常畫妄境；	若不知心，常畫妄境；	021	If one does not know the mind, one always paints false objects;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a11_12']	觀唯心造，則了真佛。	觀唯心造，則了真佛。	021	Contemplating the creation of the mind only, one understands the true Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a12_2']	上半有機、下半示觀。	上半有機、下半示觀。	021	The upper half has conditions, and the lower half shows the contemplation.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a12_7']	然有二釋。	然有二釋。	021	However, there are two explanations.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a12_10']	一云：	一云：	021	The first says:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a13_3']	若欲了佛者，應觀法界性。	若欲了佛者，應觀法界性。	021	If one wishes to understand the Buddha, one should contemplate the nature of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a14_2']	上一切差別皆唯心作，以見法即見佛故。	上一切差別皆唯心作，以見法即見佛故。	021	All distinctions above are created by the mind only, because seeing the Dharma is seeing the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a15_8']	二觀法界性是真如門，觀唯心造即生滅門，是雙結也。	二觀法界性是真如門，觀唯心造即生滅門，是雙結也。	021	The second explains that contemplating the nature of the Dharma realm is the true suchness aspect, and contemplating the creation of the mind only is the arising and ceasing aspect, which is a double conclusion.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a18_12']	又一是真如實觀、一是唯心識觀，大乘觀要不出此二，觀此二門唯是一心，皆各總攝一切法盡，二諦雙融無礙一味，三世諸佛證此為體故。	又一是真如實觀、一是唯心識觀，大乘觀要不出此二，觀此二門唯是一心，皆各總攝一切法盡，二諦雙融無礙一味，三世諸佛證此為體故。	021	Moreover, one is the true suchness contemplation, and the other is the mind-only consciousness contemplation. The essentials of Mahayana contemplation do not go beyond these two. Contemplating these two gates is only one mind, and they each comprehensively include all dharmas. The two truths are both fused without obstruction, and the Buddhas of the three times realize this as their essence, therefore.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a19_16']	欲知彼者，應當觀此既為妙極，是以暫持能破地獄。	欲知彼者，應當觀此既為妙極，是以暫持能破地獄。	021	If one wishes to know them, one should contemplate this as the most wonderful and ultimate. Therefore, temporarily upholding it can destroy the hells.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a21_1']	第十鑒達諸佛逈超色聲，心言路絕，故云智林。	第十鑒達諸佛逈超色聲，心言路絕，故云智林。	021	The tenth is to discern that all Buddhas are far beyond form and sound, with the path of mind and words cut off, therefore called the forest of wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a21_11']	頌顯此德，十頌分二：	頌顯此德，十頌分二：	021	The verses manifest this virtue, with ten verses divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a22_1']	初一標章、後九解釋。	初一標章、後九解釋。	021	The first verse summarizes the chapter, and the following nine explain it.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a22_4']	今初。	今初。	021	Now, the first.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a23_6']	若準晉本，第四句云所思不可思，則四句皆標章。	若準晉本，第四句云所思不可思，則四句皆標章。	021	If following the Jin edition, the fourth line says the thoughts are inconceivable, then all four lines summarize the chapter.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a25_3']	今經則上三句標章、第四句總結，謂標章遮過令不依識，明佛三業非凡境故；	今經則上三句標章、第四句總結，謂標章遮過令不依識，明佛三業非凡境故；	021	The current sūtra has the first three lines summarizing the chapter, and the fourth line concluding in general, meaning that the summary of the chapter blocks the faults and prevents reliance on consciousness, clarifying that the three karmas of the Buddha are not the realm of ordinary beings;
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a26_17']	第四總結顯德示智入門，謂若了唯一真心，言思斯絕，則合菩提之體故。	第四總結顯德示智入門，謂若了唯一真心，言思斯絕，則合菩提之體故。	021	The fourth concludes by summarizing the virtues and revealing the entrance to the wisdom of the gate, which means that if one understands that it is only the one true mind, words and thoughts are cut off, then one will accord with the essence of enlightenment.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a28_3']	梵本第四句云於不思何思，即是以一真心而成三業。	梵本第四句云於不思何思，即是以一真心而成三業。	021	The fourth line of the Sanskrit text says What thought is there in the unthinkable? This means using the one true mind to form the three karmas.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659a29_4']	三業不離一真，形奪相融，不可以一多思也。	三業不離一真，形奪相融，不可以一多思也。	021	The three karmas are not separate from the one truth, they mutually negate and interpenetrate, and cannot be thought of as one or many.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b01_14']	又非唯佛之三業同一真心，亦與觀者真心非異非一，故難思議。	又非唯佛之三業同一真心，亦與觀者真心非異非一，故難思議。	021	Moreover, it is not only that the three karmas of the Buddha are the same as the one true mind, but also that the true mind of the observer is neither different nor the same. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b02_14']	若能離於思議，則終日見聞亦無所見聞矣。	若能離於思議，則終日見聞亦無所見聞矣。	021	If one can transcend imagination, then even if one sees and hears all day, there is nothing seen or heard.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b03_7']	後九別釋中，即分三別：	後九別釋中，即分三別：	021	Later, in the nine specific explanations, there are three distinctions:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b04_9']	初二釋不可取、次四釋不可見、後三釋不可聞。	初二釋不可取、次四釋不可見、後三釋不可聞。	021	The first two explain the inexpressible, the next four explain the invisible, and the last three explain the inaudible.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b05_11']	今初也，初半偈奪以正釋、後一偈半縱以生過。	今初也，初半偈奪以正釋、後一偈半縱以生過。	021	Now, the first half verse refutes and correctly explains, while the last one and a half verses affirm and give rise to faults.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b06_12']	然有量等實通三業，為對下二，且就智明。	然有量等實通三業，為對下二，且就智明。	021	However, having measure and so forth actually pervades the three karmas. In order to correspond with the two below, it is just based on wisdom to explain.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b07_11']	有如理智不可言量，有如量智不可言無。	有如理智不可言量，有如量智不可言無。	021	There is the wisdom of suchness which cannot be said to have measure, and there is the wisdom of measure which cannot be said to be nonexistent.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b08_13']	又一智即是一切智故，眾智所用不相雜故。	又一智即是一切智故，眾智所用不相雜故。	021	Moreover, one wisdom is precisely all wisdom, and therefore the functions of the many wisdoms are not mixed.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b09_10']	後縱中，初半縱其令取，必無果利；	後縱中，初半縱其令取，必無果利；	021	In the latter concession, the first half concedes that if one must take it without any beneficial results,
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b09_18']	後一偈顯取之失。	後一偈顯取之失。	021	the latter one verse reveals the loss of taking it.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b12_9']	夫說法者當如法說，法無所得而欲取得，心計有說執石為寶是謂自欺，理無謂有是為自誑，終不契理。	夫說法者當如法說，法無所得而欲取得，心計有說執石為寶是謂自欺，理無謂有是為自誑，終不契理。	021	The expounder of the Dharma should expound the Dharma as it is. The Dharma is without attainment, yet one desires to attain it. Mentally reckoning there is expounding, grasping a stone and taking it to be a jewel, this is called deceiving oneself. The principle is without saying there is, this is called deceiving oneself. In the end, it does not accord with principle.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b13_9']	故云「己事不成，污他心識」，故不令眾喜。	故云「己事不成，污他心識」，故不令眾喜。	021	Therefore it is said, One's own affairs are not accomplished, and one defiles the minds of others. Therefore it does not cause the assembly to rejoice.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b14_11']	又以量無量取，則墮斷常，自損損他，故皆不可。	又以量無量取，則墮斷常，自損損他，故皆不可。	021	Moreover, taking it with measure and without measure, one falls into annihilationism and eternalism, harming oneself and harming others. Therefore it is all not permissible.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b15_10']	第二有四偈，歎佛色身深奧，釋不可見章。	第二有四偈，歎佛色身深奧，釋不可見章。	021	The second has four verses, praising the Buddha's form body as profound and mysterious, explaining the chapter on what cannot be seen.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b15_15']	文分為二：	文分為二：	021	The text is divided into two parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b16_6']	初一法說、後三喻況。	初一法說、後三喻況。	021	The first is a doctrinal explanation, and the latter three are analogies.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b16_9']	今初。	今初。	021	Now, the first.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b16_19']	非色現色，故稱為妙。	非色現色，故稱為妙。	021	Not being form, yet manifesting as form, it is called wonderful.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b17_7']	物感斯現，是曰無邊。	物感斯現，是曰無邊。	021	Responding to beings, it manifests, thus it is called boundless.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b17_18']	又色即空，故邊即無邊。	又色即空，故邊即無邊。	021	Moreover, form is precisely emptiness, thus the boundary is precisely boundless.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b19_3']	又淨識所現空色相融，故身分總別乃至一毛皆無邊量。	又淨識所現空色相融，故身分總別乃至一毛皆無邊量。	021	Moreover, the pure consciousness manifests form and emptiness merging, thus the body's parts, both general and specific, down to a single hair, are all of boundless extent.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b19_18']	攝德無盡具上三義，豈可以盡言？	攝德無盡具上三義，豈可以盡言？	021	Embracing virtues without end possesses the above three meanings. How can it be described as exhausted?
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b20_6']	次三喻中分二：	次三喻中分二：	021	Next, among the three analogies, it is divided into two:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b21_17']	初一摩尼隨映喻，喻佛地實無異色，隨感便現，故言無色而現色。	初一摩尼隨映喻，喻佛地實無異色，隨感便現，故言無色而現色。	021	The first, the analogy of the maṇi jewel reflecting, illustrates that in the Buddha's stage, there is actually no different form, but it manifests according to the response. Therefore, it says without form, yet manifesting form.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b22_12']	喻全似法，故但合云佛亦如是。	喻全似法，故但合云佛亦如是。	021	The analogy completely resembles the Dharma, thus it only combines to say the Buddha is also like this.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b24_1']	後二偈淨空現色喻，喻佛法身體非是色，能現麁妙一切諸色。	後二偈淨空現色喻，喻佛法身體非是色，能現麁妙一切諸色。	021	The latter two verses are the analogy of pure emptiness manifesting form, which illustrates that the Buddha's Dharma body is not form, yet it can manifest all coarse and subtle forms.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b24_9']	初偈喻、後偈合。	初偈喻、後偈合。	021	The first verse is the analogy, and the latter verse is the combination.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b25_8']	四句對前，但二三前却，此是分喻，故委合之。	四句對前，但二三前却，此是分喻，故委合之。	021	The four phrases correspond to the previous two and three, but the order is reversed. This is a partial analogy, so it is specifically combined.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b26_16']	以空但不可眼見而可心知，佛所現色心行處絕，故為分喻。	以空但不可眼見而可心知，佛所現色心行處絕，故為分喻。	021	Emptiness can only be known by the mind, not seen by the eyes. The form manifested by the Buddha transcends the realm of mind and action, so it is a partial analogy.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b27_18']	心眼尚不能見，況肉眼哉，此即見中絕思議也。	心眼尚不能見，況肉眼哉，此即見中絕思議也。	021	The mind-eye cannot see it, let alone the physical eye. This is the transcendence of conceptual thought within seeing.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b28_1']	問：	問：	021	Question:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b28_8']	二喻豈不違經？	二喻豈不違經？	021	How do the two analogies not contradict the sutra?
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659b29_5']	上云有無邊妙色，今云非色無色耶？	上云有無邊妙色，今云非色無色耶？	021	Above it says there are boundless wondrous forms, but now it says they are neither form nor not form?
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c01_1']	亦違諸論，佛有妙色為增上緣。	亦違諸論，佛有妙色為增上緣。	021	It also contradicts the treatises, which say the Buddha's wondrous form is the dominant condition.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c01_5']	古德云：	古德云：	021	An ancient worthy said:
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c01_17']	若約初教大乘，義如前說。	若約初教大乘，義如前說。	021	If it is about the initial teaching of Mahayana, the meaning is as explained above.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c03_12']	若實教大乘，佛地無此色聲麁相功德，但有大智大悲大定大願諸功德等。	若實教大乘，佛地無此色聲麁相功德，但有大智大悲大定大願諸功德等。	021	If it is about the true teaching of Mahayana, the Buddha ground does not have these coarse qualities of form and sound, but only the qualities of great wisdom, great compassion, great concentration, and great vows.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c04_16']	然諸功德等並同證真如，若眾生機感即現色無盡。	然諸功德等並同證真如，若眾生機感即現色無盡。	021	However, all the qualities are the same in realizing suchness. If sentient beings are inspired, then form is manifested endlessly.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c05_14', 'ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c07_3']	既無不應機時，故所現色亦無斷絕。🔽此以隨他為自，更無別他自，約此為有，故云無邊妙色。	既無不應機時，故所現色亦無斷絕。 此以隨他為自，更無別他自，約此為有，故云無邊妙色。	021	Since there is never a time when it does not accord with the capacities, therefore the manifested form is also uninterrupted.🔽This takes following others as self, and there is no other self apart from this. It is based on this that it is said to be boundless wondrous form.
['ZH_T35_1735_021:0659c08_2']	今約自說，不約隨他，故云無色非色也。	今約自說，不約隨他，故云無色非色也。	021	Now, it is explained from the perspective of self, not from the perspective of following others, therefore it is said there is no form or non-form.

This meaning is fully explained in the Sutra of the Adornment of Wisdom.

Therefore, the two analogies complement each other before and after.🔽The mani manifesting form is only said to be without form, and non-existence is merely the absence of other, not the absence of its own substance.

These two are non-dual and constitute the true body of the Buddha. Therefore, the following sutra says, The Buddha takes the Dharma as his body, pure like empty space. The various forms and appearances he manifests cause one to enter this Dharma.

Therefore, sound is not the Tathāgata, and the responding does not differ from the capacity.

Therefore, using sound to grasp is to practice a deviant path. If one grasps by separating from sound, one is not yet free from annihilation and nonexistence.
