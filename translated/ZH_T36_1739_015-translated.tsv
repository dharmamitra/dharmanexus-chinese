['ZH_T36_1739_015:0818b11_6']	一釋品名目者，此品名〈光明覺品〉，為明因如來放十信中足輪下光照燭十方，初云一三千大千，以次增廣，至不可說法界虛空界，為明無盡，令信心者了心境廣大無盡無礙，與法界虛空界等。	一釋品名目者，此品名〈光明覺品〉，為明因如來放十信中足輪下光照燭十方，初云一三千大千，以次增廣，至不可說法界虛空界，為明無盡，令信心者了心境廣大無盡無礙，與法界虛空界等。	First, explaining the chapter title, this chapter is called the Chapter on the Illumination of Enlightenment. It clarifies that in the tenth stage of faith, the light emitted from the soles of the feet illuminates the ten directions, initially saying one great trichiliocosm, and then increasing in breadth to the inconceivable Dharma realm and the realm of space, to illustrate the inexhaustible. It causes those with faith to understand that the mind and its objects are vast, inexhaustible, and unobstructed, equal to the Dharma realm and the realm of space.
['ZH_T36_1739_015:0818b13_9']	明其自己法身智身願行亦等故，以光所照覺悟信心令修行故，以是因緣，名〈光明覺品〉。	明其自己法身智身願行亦等故，以光所照覺悟信心令修行故，以是因緣，名〈光明覺品〉。	It clarifies that one's own Dharma body, wisdom body, and vows and practices are also equal, and therefore the light illuminates and awakens those with faith, causing them to cultivate practice. For this reason, it is called the Chapter on the Illumination of Enlightenment.

Therefore, it is called the treasury that illuminates the ten directions.

Therefore, in this chapter, it again emits the light that entered below the Tathāgata's feet in the first assembly, in order to establish the ten faiths.
