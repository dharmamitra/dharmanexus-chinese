['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165a24_0']	釋列眾中，初辨次第。言「多爾」者，亦有經中	釋列眾中，初辨次第。言「多爾」者，亦有經中	01c	In explaining the assembly, first the sequence is distinguished. Mostly so means that in some sutras
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165a25_0']	菩薩後列，各有所表。如《華嚴經》不列聲聞，	菩薩後列，各有所表。如《華嚴經》不列聲聞，	01c	the bodhisattvas are listed last, each with something they represent. Like the Huayan Sutra, which does not list the shravakas,
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165a26_4']	純無雜故。	純無雜故。	01c	because it is pure and unmixed.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165a27_13']	舊解者多是光宅，與《大論》意同故無別破，但總結云似兩解耳。	舊解者多是光宅，與《大論》意同故無別破，但總結云似兩解耳。	01c	The old explanations are mostly from Guangzhai, which is the same as the meaning of the Treatise, so there is no separate refutation, but it is concluded that it is similar to the two explanations.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165a29_2']	注「云云」者，事似因緣須具四悉，義似約教復須論八。	注「云云」者，事似因緣須具四悉，義似約教復須論八。	01c	The annotation and so on means that the matter seems like the four conditions of dependent origination, and the meaning seems like the four siddhantas.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b01_11']	事即身也，故云親疎，義即諦理，故云涅槃等，形服異故即世界。	事即身也，故云親疎，義即諦理，故云涅槃等，形服異故即世界。	01c	The matter is the body, so it is said to be close or distant. The meaning is the principle of truth, so it is said to be nirvana, etc. The difference in appearance and clothing is the world.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b02_10']	親者生善，疎者破惡，不親不疎即第一義。	親者生善，疎者破惡，不親不疎即第一義。	01c	The close generates good, the distant destroys evil, and the neither close nor distant is the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b04_6']	於有義中既以三諦，以諦對教則四可識，於藏等四辨漸等四，其義可知。	於有義中既以三諦，以諦對教則四可識，於藏等四辨漸等四，其義可知。	01c	Since the three truths are used in the meaningful, and the truths are matched with the teachings, the four can be recognized. In the four such as the Tripiṭaka, the four such as the gradual are distinguished, and the meaning can be known.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b06_12']	又兩二義並欣涅槃，及四菩薩並不欣不著故皆居中，唯詣實理兼能利人，故居中求宗超彼凡聖。	又兩二義並欣涅槃，及四菩薩並不欣不著故皆居中，唯詣實理兼能利人，故居中求宗超彼凡聖。	01c	Moreover, both pairs of two meanings are delighted with nirvana, and the four bodhisattvas are neither delighted nor attached, so they all abide in the middle. Only those who seek the ultimate truth and are able to benefit others dwell in the middle, surpassing both ordinary beings and sages.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b07_15']	若以入中為菩薩，即指別教地上、圓教始終。	若以入中為菩薩，即指別教地上、圓教始終。	01c	If entering the middle is considered bodhisattva, then it refers to the stages above the separate teaching and the beginning and end of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b07_19']	注家云：	注家云：	01c	The annotator says:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b09_12']	聲聞學疎敦之於內，菩薩道親忘之於外，此但得事而失義，似迹而迷本。	聲聞學疎敦之於內，菩薩道親忘之於外，此但得事而失義，似迹而迷本。	01c	The śrāvakas are estranged from the inner, while the bodhisattvas are distant from the outer. This only obtains the events but loses the meaning, resembling the traces but being confused about the origin.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b10_2']	況復觀心、因緣耶？	況復觀心、因緣耶？	01c	Moreover, what about contemplating the mind and causes and conditions?
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b12_11']	約本迹中，此經列眾超出群經，故人天二乘能引之人本非下地，所引之眾堪通別記，語通意兼，故云內祕。	約本迹中，此經列眾超出群經，故人天二乘能引之人本非下地，所引之眾堪通別記，語通意兼，故云內祕。	01c	In terms of the original and traces, this sūtra's assembly surpasses the assemblies of many sūtras, so the two kinds of people and the two vehicles who can lead are originally not of the lower stages. The assembly that is led is able to receive the prophecies of the shared and distinct teachings. The words are shared but the meaning is combined, so it says secretly.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b13_11']	皆大薩埵，既能迹引二邊判非凡小，故云薩埵。	皆大薩埵，既能迹引二邊判非凡小，故云薩埵。	01c	All are great beings. Since they can lead to the two extremes and judge them as not being ordinary or small, they are called beings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b14_12']	菩薩濫本故且不論，應知亦且約體用論也。	菩薩濫本故且不論，應知亦且約體用論也。	01c	Bodhisattvas are confused with the basis, so they are not discussed for the time being. It should be known that they are also discussed in terms of essence and function for the time being.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b16_1']	觀解後「云云」者，亦應更約因緣明觀諸教開顯及本迹觀。	觀解後「云云」者，亦應更約因緣明觀諸教開顯及本迹觀。	01c	The contemplation interpretation, after and so on, should also further discuss the contemplation of the various teachings revealed through causes and conditions, as well as the contemplation of the original and traces.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b17_2']	釋列聲聞，準《法華論》以八義故，先列聲聞：	釋列聲聞，準《法華論》以八義故，先列聲聞：	01c	In explaining the listing of the śrāvakas, according to the Fahua lun, it is listed first for eight reasons:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b17_13']	一、為顯親聞後不謗故；	一、為顯親聞後不謗故；	01c	First, to show that they heard it directly and will not slander it later;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b18_5']	二、攝不定性迴心入大故；	二、攝不定性迴心入大故；	01c	Second, to include those of indeterminate nature who turn their minds and enter the great;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b18_16']	三、除尊貴慢非究竟故；	三、除尊貴慢非究竟故；	01c	Third, to eliminate the arrogance of the noble ones, because it is not ultimate;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b19_3']	四、常隨佛故；	四、常隨佛故；	01c	Fourth, because they always follow the Buddha;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b19_10']	五、形儀同故；	五、形儀同故；	01c	Fifth, because their appearance is the same;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b19_19']	六、令內眷捨欲故；	六、令內眷捨欲故；	01c	Sixth, to cause the inner retinue to abandon desire;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b20_5']	七、令菩薩敬故；	七、令菩薩敬故；	01c	Seventh, to cause the bodhisattvas to respect;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b20_13']	八、令眾生信故。	八、令眾生信故。	01c	Eighth, to cause sentient beings to have faith.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b23_1']	然《論》中八義唯第二一半獨屬今經，以不定性此土得故，仍少一半，若定性者彼土得故、未來得故；	然《論》中八義唯第二一半獨屬今經，以不定性此土得故，仍少一半，若定性者彼土得故、未來得故；	01c	However, among the eight meanings in the treatise, only the first half of the second one belongs to the present sūtra, because those of indeterminate nature attain it in this land, but it still lacks half. If those of determinate nature, they attain it in that land and will attain it in the future;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b23_15']	餘之七義論眾前後，通諸經故。	餘之七義論眾前後，通諸經故。	01c	The remaining seven meanings are discussed in the assemblies in sequence, because they are common to all sūtras.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b25_5']	以第二義入餘七中，使七一一皆有第二，方令八義全在今經。	以第二義入餘七中，使七一一皆有第二，方令八義全在今經。	01c	By using the second meaning to enter the other seven, causing each of the seven to have the second, only then does the eighth meaning remain entirely in the present sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b25_14']	若依今意更有三義：	若依今意更有三義：	01c	If following the present meaning, there are three more meanings:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b27_1']	欲別記故、別開權故、先顯本故，故令餘義永殊昔教。	欲別記故、別開權故、先顯本故，故令餘義永殊昔教。	01c	Because of wanting to record separately, because of separately revealing the provisional, because of first manifesting the original, therefore causing the remaining meanings to be forever different from the former teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b27_15']	故論文意諸經多爾，所以通釋。	故論文意諸經多爾，所以通釋。	01c	Therefore the meaning of the treatise is that many sūtras are like this, and thus they are explained in common.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b28_14']	今使諸教雖共復殊，方等先列，以四義故：	今使諸教雖共復殊，方等先列，以四義故：	01c	Now causing the teachings, although shared, to be different, the vaipulya first lists, because of four meanings:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165b29_14']	欲斥奪故、欲密引故、令體信故，令味變故。	欲斥奪故、欲密引故、令體信故，令味變故。	01c	Because of wanting to rebuke and take away, because of wanting to secretly lead, because of causing them to trust, because of causing the flavor to change.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c01_1']	般若亦四：	般若亦四：	01c	Prajñā also has four:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c02_2']	欲洮汰故、欲委業故、密引進故、成熟酥故。	欲洮汰故、欲委業故、密引進故、成熟酥故。	01c	Because of wanting to wash and refine, because of wanting to entrust the teachings, because of secretly leading and advancing, because of maturing the ghee.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c03_2']	故知《論》文通前二味，如向各四，又異前後。	故知《論》文通前二味，如向各四，又異前後。	01c	Therefore it should be known that the treatise text is common to the former two flavors, like the four each mentioned above, and also different from before and after.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c03_8']	《論》又云：	《論》又云：	01c	The treatise also says:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c03_17']	先僧次尼亦有八義：	先僧次尼亦有八義：	01c	First the monks, then the nuns, also have eight meanings:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c04_1']	一、男尊女卑；	一、男尊女卑；	01c	First, men are superior and women are inferior;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c04_8']	二、入道先後；	二、入道先後；	01c	Second, the sequence of entering the Way;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c04_15']	三、師弟不同；	三、師弟不同；	01c	Third, the difference between teachers and disciples;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c04_22']	四、傳法能不；	四、傳法能不；	01c	Fourth, whether or not one is able to transmit the Dharma;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c05_6']	五、結集進退；	五、結集進退；	01c	Fifth, advancing and retreating in the compilation of the canon;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c05_13']	六、同住得不；	六、同住得不；	01c	Sixth, whether or not one can abide together;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c05_20']	七、多少推讓；	七、多少推讓；	01c	Seventh, pushing and yielding based on seniority;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c06_3']	八、得歎有無。	八、得歎有無。	01c	Eighth, whether or not one can praise.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c06_17']	此八全通前之三味，多在酪教。	此八全通前之三味，多在酪教。	01c	These eight are completely applicable to the first three flavors, and are mostly in the milk teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c07_12']	若準同是聲聞，仍少第二意也。	若準同是聲聞，仍少第二意也。	01c	If it is based on being the same as the śrāvakas, it still lacks the second meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c09_1']	於今別中唯除委業，準義仍有，以同比丘聞轉教故也。	於今別中唯除委業，準義仍有，以同比丘聞轉教故也。	01c	In the present distinction, only the entrustment of the teachings is excluded. According to the meaning, it still exists, because it is the same as the bhikṣus hearing the transmitted teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c10_14']	故委業時非全無分，自餘諸義並同比丘，於五味中漸教當眾其義不異。	故委業時非全無分，自餘諸義並同比丘，於五味中漸教當眾其義不異。	01c	Therefore, at the time of entrusting the teachings, it is not completely without a share. The remaining meanings are the same as the bhikṣus. In the five flavors, the gradual teachings are the same as the assembly, and the meaning is no different.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c11_11']	次出舊解，云大小名聞者，意云：	次出舊解，云大小名聞者，意云：	01c	Next, the old explanations say that the names of the great and small are known. The meaning is as follows:
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c12_15']	名即己名、聞即他聞，所以名大故聞大、名小故聞小。	名即己名、聞即他聞，所以名大故聞大、名小故聞小。	01c	The name is one's own name, and the hearing is the hearing of others. The reason is that because the name is great, the hearing is great. The name is small, so the hearing is small.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c13_6']	今但依文故，破其無據。	今但依文故，破其無據。	01c	Now, I will simply rely on the text to refute his lack of basis.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c14_5']	言「依文」者，但約所列多少以明所識多少。	言「依文」者，但約所列多少以明所識多少。	01c	As for relying on the text, I will simply use the number of people listed to clarify the number of people known.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c14_18']	前列萬二千，又云眾所知識；	前列萬二千，又云眾所知識；	01c	Previously, it was listed as 12,000, and it also said known to the multitude;
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c16_9']	後云二千，又無知識，縱以名聞用釋知識，後文全無，何小之有？	後云二千，又無知識，縱以名聞用釋知識，後文全無，何小之有？	01c	Later, it said 2,000, and there was no mention of knowledge. Even if fame is used to explain knowledge, the later text does not have it at all, so how small is it?
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c16_18']	況復大小一向無憑。	況復大小一向無憑。	01c	Moreover, the distinction between great and small is completely without basis.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c18_3']	初釋類中先通釋五字，次「釋論」下別釋四義，比丘合故。	初釋類中先通釋五字，次「釋論」下別釋四義，比丘合故。	01c	In the initial explanation of the category, the five characters are first explained in general, and then the four meanings are explained separately under the Treatise on Great Wisdom, combining the bhikṣus.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c19_15']	初通釋中五字通收諸有德者，所與之徒既標於大，豈唯異於下眾而已。	初通釋中五字通收諸有德者，所與之徒既標於大，豈唯異於下眾而已。	01c	In the initial general explanation, the five characters comprehensively include all those with virtue. Since the disciples are already labeled as great, how can they only be distinguished from the lower assembly?
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c21_15']	於比丘中其例復多，四門三脫析體通智辨空之例，秖得且云高譽德行，何可具論？	於比丘中其例復多，四門三脫析體通智辨空之例，秖得且云高譽德行，何可具論？	01c	In the bhikṣus, there are many more examples. The examples of the four gates, the three liberations, the analysis of essence, the liberation of wisdom, and the discernment of emptiness, can only be said to be of high reputation and virtue for now. How can they be discussed in detail?
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c22_6']	今云如貴類之班輩也。	今云如貴類之班輩也。	01c	Now it is said to be like the ranks of the noble class.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c23_12']	次別釋四義者，初「釋論」下別釋「與」字，初文即因緣釋。	次別釋四義者，初「釋論」下別釋「與」字，初文即因緣釋。	01c	Next, the specific explanation of the four meanings. The first, below the Treatise explains, specifically explains the character yu. The first text is the causal condition explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c25_1']	若於此七為四悉者，時處世界，戒是為人，心見對治，道脫第一義。	若於此七為四悉者，時處世界，戒是為人，心見對治，道脫第一義。	01c	If the seven are divided into the four siddhāntas, time and place are the world, precepts are for the person, mind and views are the counteractive, and the path of liberation is the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c26_7']	若準前三，在昔教者則七義唯三，道脫等俱屬對治意也。	若準前三，在昔教者則七義唯三，道脫等俱屬對治意也。	01c	If according to the previous three, in the former teachings then the seven meanings are only three, and the path of liberation and so forth all belong to the counteractive meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0165c28_3']	圓教七一俱屬圓四，約教雖別究竟唯圓，雖七而同故七名一，一即共也。	圓教七一俱屬圓四，約教雖別究竟唯圓，雖七而同故七名一，一即共也。	01c	In the perfect teaching, the seven and one all belong to the perfect four. Although the teachings are different, the ultimate is only perfect. Although seven, they are the same, so the seven are called one, and one is the common.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a03_17']	四教不同通在五味，具如諸經不可遍述，且準歎德在三藏教者，同感佛時、同鹿苑處、同別脫戒、同一切智心、同無漏正見、同三十七道、同有餘脫、為同聞人，入通序時已得記者，全成圓人七一故也。	四教不同通在五味，具如諸經不可遍述，且準歎德在三藏教者，同感佛時、同鹿苑處、同別脫戒、同一切智心、同無漏正見、同三十七道、同有餘脫、為同聞人，入通序時已得記者，全成圓人七一故也。	01c	The four teachings are not the same, but they are all included in the five flavors. They are fully described in various sūtras and cannot be fully recounted here. For now, based on the praise of virtues in the Tripiṭaka Teaching, they have the same feeling for the Buddha, the same place in the Deer Park, the same precepts of individual liberation, the same mind of omniscience, the same undefiled right view, the same thirty-seven factors of the path, the same remaining liberation, and the same people who have heard the same thing. When entering the general introduction, they have already received predictions and completely become perfect people with the seven ones.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a07_3']	同妙感應時、同見妙依處、同得究竟戒、同證種智心、同無作正見、同圓實道品、同不思議脫，得授記已即同菩薩，安得復以聲聞歎德？	同妙感應時、同見妙依處、同得究竟戒、同證種智心、同無作正見、同圓實道品、同不思議脫，得授記已即同菩薩，安得復以聲聞歎德？	01c	They have the same wonderful response to the times, the same view of the wonderful依處, the same attainment of ultimate precepts, the same realization of the mind of various knowledges, the same unconditioned right view, the same perfect and real factors of the path, and the same inconceivable liberation. After receiving the prediction, they are the same as the bodhisattvas. How can they still be praised as śrāvakas?
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a07_12']	豈結集者謬抑德耶？	豈結集者謬抑德耶？	01c	How could the compiler mistakenly belittle their virtues?
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a09_1']	故知在四味時隨味而變，經家從本列在聲聞，故依本歎。	故知在四味時隨味而變，經家從本列在聲聞，故依本歎。	01c	Therefore, we know that when they were in the four flavors, they changed according to the flavor. The sūtra compiler lists them as śrāvakas based on their original status, so he praises them based on their original status.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a12_1']	若不仍本，焉知聲聞有權有實，實者得記知有所從，聞《法華》時大小別故，故約教判須通始終，故三教七，或本是三，或是轉入。	若不仍本，焉知聲聞有權有實，實者得記知有所從，聞《法華》時大小別故，故約教判須通始終，故三教七，或本是三，或是轉入。	01c	If one does not return to the original, how can one know that the śrāvakas have provisional and real? The real ones receive predictions and know where they come from. When hearing the Lotus Sūtra, there is a distinction between the small and the great. Therefore, the teachings must be divided into beginning and end. Therefore, there are three teachings and seven. Or they are originally three, or they are turned into.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a12_15']	初約三藏一七一者，生滅同故。	初約三藏一七一者，生滅同故。	01c	First, according to the Tripiṭaka, there is one seven. This is because the arising and ceasing are the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a14_6']	通教二者，分利鈍故，利兼圓別，應云三七，且通總說同為一例。	通教二者，分利鈍故，利兼圓別，應云三七，且通總說同為一例。	01c	In the Shared Teaching, there are two. This is because they are divided into sharp and dull faculties. The sharp ones are equal to the Distinct and Perfect. It should be said that there are three sevens. For now, they are generally said to be the same as one example.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a15_14']	別云為無量者，自行化他橫豎皆四門，門門四悉入者不同。	別云為無量者，自行化他橫豎皆四門，門門四悉入者不同。	01c	The Distinct Teaching is said to be immeasurable. This is because in one's own practice and teaching others, both horizontal and vertical, there are four gates. The different ways of entering the four aspects of teaching are not the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0166a16_8']	圓教一者，發心畢竟二不別故。	圓教一者，發心畢竟二不別故。	01c	The Perfect Teaching is one. This is because the initial resolve and the final accomplishment are not different.

Therefore, it is known that the two assemblies of the great and small are listed as the assembly that hears together, and one should not expect to receive predictions.

The Avatamsaka Sutra simultaneously indicates the able and the responsive. The able refers to the wisdom of the able response, and the true refers to the principle of the responsive. Because the person responds to the principle with wisdom, it is said to respond to the true.

['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0168a22_16']	「不生於生」者，取無為證生於界外，不生是生故不令生。	「不生於生」者，取無為證生於界外，不生是生故不令生。	01c	Not giving birth to birth means giving rise to the realization of the unconditioned in the external realms. Not giving birth is giving birth, so it does not allow birth.

The first uses the three meanings of the small, and next uses the three virtues of the great.🔽Previously, the traces were entrusted to express the original and traces, and next, the original name was used to penetrate to the traces. It is to clarify that the name is common but the meaning is distinct.

['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0168b05_9']	又前釋三義以通昔，後釋三德而唯今。	又前釋三義以通昔，後釋三德而唯今。	01c	Moreover, the previous explanation uses the three meanings to penetrate the past, and the later explanation uses the three virtues to be only in the present.

Therefore, the two vehicles are combined with humans and gods, and asuras are further omitted, while bodhisattvas are still distinguished. It is also possible that the first ground is the dharma realm of the Buddha. The various texts combine and omit according to the meaning, and one should understand accordingly.

First, demonstrating the division of one's own practice and transforming others, because in the Distinct Teaching there are no nine inherent virtues, one's own and others' sever [delusions], and one separately cultivates conditions and wisdom to adorn the originally existent eternally abiding dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0171b01_16']	次「依於」下依境起行，亦指但理為九界覆而為所依，法界秖是法性，復是迷悟所依。	次「依於」下依境起行，亦指但理為九界覆而為所依，法界秖是法性，復是迷悟所依。	01c	Next, based on refers to the arising of practice based on objects. It also points to the nine realms covered by principle alone as the basis. The Dharma realm is simply the nature of dharmas, which is also the basis of delusion and enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0171b04_11']	於中亦應云從無住本立一切法，無明覆理能覆所覆俱名無住，但即不即異而分教殊，今背迷成悟專緣理性而破九界。	於中亦應云從無住本立一切法，無明覆理能覆所覆俱名無住，但即不即異而分教殊，今背迷成悟專緣理性而破九界。	01c	In this, it should also be said that all dharmas are established based on the unmoving ground. Ignorance covering principle, both the concealer and the concealed, are called unmoving. It is only the difference between being identical and not identical that distinguishes the teachings. Now, turning away from delusion to achieve enlightenment, exclusively contemplating the principle of reality, one destroys the nine realms.

Therefore, both the form and image of cultivation and nature are endowed with the ten realms, and they do not go beyond the mirror of the principle of the Dharma-nature. Seeing the illumination, form, and image of cultivation and nature as originally thus, the inside and outside of the mirror are one, free from the conceptual thoughts of the three teachings. In general, using the non-dual wisdom of non-discrimination, relying on principle to universally obliterate the mind, realm, brightness, and darkness, therefore it is said not contemplating.

Because the bodhisattva and buddha uses are opposed to the small, it is called small and large. All are obliterated, therefore they are all called non-existent, and are no longer distinguished as either nature or cultivation.
['ZH_T34_1719_01c:0171b26_4']	「但緣」下泯前心境，以法性實相即是三諦三觀，一切佛法之大都，若泯若照無非法性，法性之體離泯照故全泯照是。	「但緣」下泯前心境，以法性實相即是三諦三觀，一切佛法之大都，若泯若照無非法性，法性之體離泯照故全泯照是。	01c	But conditions below obliterates the previous mind and objects. Because the true nature of dharmas and the true aspect of reality are precisely the three truths and three contemplations, the great essentials of all buddha-dharmas, whether obliterating or illuminating, there is nothing that is not the true nature of dharmas. Because the essence of the true nature of dharmas is apart from obliteration and illumination, the entire obliteration and illumination is.
