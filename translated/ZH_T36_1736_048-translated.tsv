['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c17_16']	況燈光明為能成，類前亦成蓋等。	況燈光明為能成，類前亦成蓋等。	Moreover, if the light of lamps is used to accomplish, it is also like the previous accomplishment of canopies and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c19_6']	以燈光明成燈光明，此之光上難具楯等，故云不全通於蓋等。	以燈光明成燈光明，此之光上難具楯等，故云不全通於蓋等。	If the light of lamps is used to accomplish the light of lamps, it is difficult for this light to have railings and so forth, and therefore it says They do not completely apply to canopies and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c20_17']	以能成中有燈光明，所成之中復有燈光明，故略舉燈光以示無楯等。	以能成中有燈光明，所成之中復有燈光明，故略舉燈光以示無楯等。	Because it can accomplish the light of the lamp in the intermediate state, and the light of the lamp in the intermediate state that is accomplished also has the light of the lamp, therefore, the light of the lamp is briefly mentioned to show the absence of a fence, etc.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c21_14']	例且如香河，河裏如何安前楯等？	例且如香河，河裏如何安前楯等？	For example, how can a fence, etc., be placed in a fragrant river?

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c25_12']	欲將離相無得導前隨相之有故。	欲將離相無得導前隨相之有故。	It is in order to use the detachment and non-attainment to guide the existence of following characteristics.

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c27_3']	此意是生後，亦不住於離相故。	此意是生後，亦不住於離相故。	This meaning is the arising of the later, also because it does not abide in the characteristics of detachment.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c27_20']	疏「準大般若」下，例釋無得為方便。	疏「準大般若」下，例釋無得為方便。	The commentary states: According to the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra, it is explained by analogy that non-attainment is a skillful means.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0372c28_16']	如清淨歷一切法，則以清淨為方便也。	如清淨歷一切法，則以清淨為方便也。	Just as purity pervades all dharmas, purity is the skillful means.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a02_7']	若云無生，即云行般若波羅蜜時知一切法無生，所謂色無生、受想行識無生，眼無生、耳鼻舌身意無生等。	若云無生，即云行般若波羅蜜時知一切法無生，所謂色無生、受想行識無生，眼無生、耳鼻舌身意無生等。	If it is said to be unborn, then it is said that when practicing prajñā-pāramitā, one knows that all dharmas are unborn, namely, form is unborn, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are unborn, the eyes are unborn, the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are unborn, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a05_4']	今此猶是略舉能入方便，廣更有多，故復有等言，等取無依無作、清淨、不增不減、不垢不淨、不可取不可見、不可動不可壞等。	今此猶是略舉能入方便，廣更有多，故復有等言，等取無依無作、清淨、不增不減、不垢不淨、不可取不可見、不可動不可壞等。	Now this is still a brief mention of the means of entry. There are many more in detail, so there is the word etc. again. Etc. includes being without support, without action, pure, neither increasing nor decreasing, neither defiled nor pure, ungraspable, invisible, unmovable, indestructible, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a05_17']	疏「謂事法既虛」下，分二：	疏「謂事法既虛」下，分二：	The commentary says The dharmas of events are already empty and so forth, which is divided into two parts:

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a06_13']	此有二意：	此有二意：	This has two meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a08_6']	一正以緣生即空破權小見，顯業不能為因招果，果亦不能為果酬因。	一正以緣生即空破權小見，顯業不能為因招果，果亦不能為果酬因。	First, it directly uses dependent origination as emptiness to refute the views of the provisional and the small, revealing that karma cannot act as a cause to attract results, and results also cannot act as results to repay causes.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a08_17']	二兼破外道因中有果等。	二兼破外道因中有果等。	Second, it also refutes the non-Buddhist teachings that the effect exists within the cause, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a10_15']	彼計因中有果者，如乳是酪因，乳中有酪，成酪之後亦有於乳，故曰果中有因。	彼計因中有果者，如乳是酪因，乳中有酪，成酪之後亦有於乳，故曰果中有因。	As for their theory of cause containing effect, it is like milk being the cause of yogurt, with yogurt contained in milk. Even after becoming yogurt, there is still milk, so it is said that effect contains cause.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a12_1']	疏「若約觀心」者，上約法理通境及智，今約觀心。	疏「若約觀心」者，上約法理通境及智，今約觀心。	As for if it is about contemplating the mind, above it was about the principle of dharmas, the common realm and wisdom. Now it is about contemplating the mind.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a13_5']	但一是非有即名為寂，亦無心於事理方稱為寂。	但一是非有即名為寂，亦無心於事理方稱為寂。	But if there is no existence, it is called quiescence. If there is no mind in phenomena and principles, it is called quiescence.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a14_6']	不失於照故名為用，不取用相即用常寂。	不失於照故名為用，不取用相即用常寂。	Because it does not lose illumination, it is called function. If one does not grasp the characteristics of function, then function is always quiescent.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a15_11']	疏「此與初句但事理之異」者，初句約理，無入而入。	疏「此與初句但事理之異」者，初句約理，無入而入。	The commentary states, This is only different from the first phrase in terms of phenomena and principles. The first phrase is about principle, without entering yet entering.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a16_20']	今約事上，無入能入，以諸法即事而能深入，故云「即事入玄」。	今約事上，無入能入，以諸法即事而能深入，故云「即事入玄」。	Now it is about phenomena, without entering yet able to enter. Because all dharmas are phenomena that can deeply enter, it is called immediately using phenomena to enter the profound.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a17_18']	疏「大般若云」下，引此文者，揀義不同。	疏「大般若云」下，引此文者，揀義不同。	The commentary states, The Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra says... The reason for citing this passage is to distinguish the different meanings.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a18_9']	謂般若意，却是即用而寂。	謂般若意，却是即用而寂。	That is to say, the meaning of prajñā is rather using while being quiescent.

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a21_2']	」此偈則先正後反，《大般若》則先反後正。	」此偈則先正後反，《大般若》則先反後正。	This verse first affirms and then negates, while the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra first negates and then affirms.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a21_18']	今此中意，明理不礙事，故意別也。	今此中意，明理不礙事，故意別也。	The meaning here is to clarify that principle does not obstruct phenomena, so the intention is different.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a23_4']	疏「末句不有能所見」者，以文言不有於法，法通能所見也。	疏「末句不有能所見」者，以文言不有於法，法通能所見也。	The commentary says the last line does not have the seer and the seen because the text does not have dharmas, and dharmas encompass the seer and the seen.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a23_14']	何以得知法是能所見？	何以得知法是能所見？	How can it be known that dharmas are the seer and the seen?
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a24_18']	以下句云「悉知見故」，即同金剛如來悉知悉見。	以下句云「悉知見故」，即同金剛如來悉知悉見。	Because the following line says because of knowing and seeing all, which is the same as the vajra-like samādhi where the Tathāgata knows and sees all.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a25_19']	疏「待對假言故皆不可得」者，出絕事理之意。	疏「待對假言故皆不可得」者，出絕事理之意。	The commentary says because of the provisional words of mutual dependence, they are all unobtainable explains the meaning of transcending phenomena and principle.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a26_15']	一相待門，謂待事說理、待理說事。	一相待門，謂待事說理、待理說事。	The first is the gate of mutual dependence, which means depending on phenomena to speak of principle, and depending on principle to speak of phenomena.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a27_9']	如因長有短，短不可得等。	如因長有短，短不可得等。	It is like because of length there is shortness, but shortness cannot be obtained, and so forth.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a28_6']	二云假言者，諸法寂滅，本絕名言。	二云假言者，諸法寂滅，本絕名言。	The second says provisional words because all dharmas are quiescent and originally transcend names and words.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a29_1']	今云事理皆假名耳，故皆雙絕。	今云事理皆假名耳，故皆雙絕。	Now it says that both phenomena and principle are provisional names, and therefore both are utterly transcendent.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373a29_15']	上是疏家釋成，下句經自釋成。	上是疏家釋成，下句經自釋成。	The above is the commentary's explanation, and the following sentence is the sutra's own explanation.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b01_11']	疏「良以事虛」下，出事理無礙之相。	疏「良以事虛」下，出事理無礙之相。	The commentary below The reason is that phenomena are empty presents the characteristics of the unobstructedness of phenomena and principle.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b02_16']	是總意，亦十門中相即門，是三義中無礙義也，廣如上說。	是總意，亦十門中相即門，是三義中無礙義也，廣如上說。	This is the general meaning, and also the interpenetration of phenomena and principle among the ten gates, which is the unobstructed meaning among the three meanings, as explained above in detail.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b03_8']	疏「上四句」下，總融前四。	疏「上四句」下，總融前四。	The commentary below The above four sentences comprehensively integrates the previous four.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b04_5']	言「有未曾損」者，法即是空，非法滅空故。	言「有未曾損」者，法即是空，非法滅空故。	It says there has never been any harm because the dharma is emptiness, not because the dharma ceases to be empty.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b05_2']	「有未始存」者，即空之有，有相虛故。	「有未始存」者，即空之有，有相虛故。	There has never been any existence means that existence is emptiness, because the characteristics of existence are void.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b06_12']	言「無隱無顯」者，事存則空隱，理存則空顯，今由兩亡故非隱顯。	言「無隱無顯」者，事存則空隱，理存則空顯，今由兩亡故非隱顯。	It says neither hidden nor revealed because when phenomena exist, emptiness is hidden, and when principle exists, emptiness is revealed. Now, because both are absent, it is neither hidden nor revealed.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b07_17']	言「存沒同時」者，空不礙有故存，有不礙空故沒。	言「存沒同時」者，空不礙有故存，有不礙空故沒。	As for existence and non-existence occurring simultaneously, emptiness does not obstruct existence, so there is existence; existence does not obstruct emptiness, so there is non-existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b08_17']	然隱顯皆就理明，存沒並約事說，亦影略耳。	然隱顯皆就理明，存沒並約事說，亦影略耳。	However, concealing and revealing are both explained in terms of principle, while existence and non-existence are both discussed in terms of phenomena, which is also a kind of ellipsis.

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b10_13']	此則非唯離前隨相，亦離離相，真無礙也，真實際也。	此則非唯離前隨相，亦離離相，真無礙也，真實際也。	This not only goes beyond the previous characteristics, but also goes beyond the characteristics of detachment, truly unobstructed, truly the ultimate reality.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b11_11']	疏「因緣故有」者，然通相說，總有四義：	疏「因緣故有」者，然通相說，總有四義：	The commentary's because of causes and conditions, there is generally has four meanings:
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b12_15']	一緣生故有、二無性故空、三緣生故空、四無性故有。	一緣生故有、二無性故空、三緣生故空、四無性故有。	1. Because of arising from conditions, there is; 2. Because of having no nature, it is empty; 3. Because of arising from conditions, it is empty; 4. Because of having no nature, there is.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b13_14']	今但取因緣二句，謂法從緣生，安得言無？	今但取因緣二句，謂法從緣生，安得言無？	Now, only the two statements of causes and conditions are taken, namely, since dharmas arise from conditions, how can it be said that they do not exist?
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b14_6']	二從緣無性，故名為空。	二從緣無性，故名為空。	Second, because of having no nature from conditions, it is called empty.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b14_14']	上二即空有二門。	上二即空有二門。	The above two are the two approaches of emptiness and existence.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b15_11']	從因緣故不有者，即明中道亦從因緣。	從因緣故不有者，即明中道亦從因緣。	Because of causes and conditions, there is not clarifies the middle way also arises from causes and conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b16_3']	謂既緣有，有即不有；	謂既緣有，有即不有；	It means that since there is existence from conditions, existence is not existence;
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b16_13']	既從緣空，空即不空。	既從緣空，空即不空。	Since it is empty from conditions, emptiness is not empty.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b17_4']	合前二句，即亦空亦有。	合前二句，即亦空亦有。	Combining the previous two sentences, it is both empty and existent.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b17_13']	四門之理皆從因緣。	四門之理皆從因緣。	The principle of the four approaches all arise from causes and conditions.

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b19_11']	例上所明義，略舉綱要耳。	例上所明義，略舉綱要耳。	It is a general example of what was explained above, merely bringing up the main points.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b20_6']	疏「故中論云」下，引證皆從因緣。	疏「故中論云」下，引證皆從因緣。	The commentary below Therefore, the Madhyamaka-śāstra says... cites evidence that all arise from causes and conditions.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b22_2']	然論此偈前有一偈云「因緣所生法，我說即是空，亦為是假名，亦是中道義。	然論此偈前有一偈云「因緣所生法，我說即是空，亦為是假名，亦是中道義。	However, before this verse in the treatise, there is a verse that says: The dharmas produced by causes and conditions, I say are precisely empty, and are also provisional names, and are also the meaning of the middle way.
['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b23_7']	未曾有一法，不從因緣生，是故一切法，無不是空者。	未曾有一法，不從因緣生，是故一切法，無不是空者。	There has never been a single dharma that does not arise from causes and conditions, Therefore, all dharmas are not not empty.

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373b28_10']	而論略結云「是故一切法無不是空者」，亦合云「未曾有一法不從因緣生」，是故一切法無不是假者，又是故一切法無不是中者，今此但取一切法從緣之義耳。	而論略結云「是故一切法無不是空者」，亦合云「未曾有一法不從因緣生」，是故一切法無不是假者，又是故一切法無不是中者，今此但取一切法從緣之義耳。	And the treatise briefly concludes by saying Therefore, all dharmas are not not empty, which should also be combined with There has never been a single dharma that is not produced from causes and conditions, so Therefore, all dharmas are not not provisional, and Therefore, all dharmas are not not the Middle. Now, this only takes the meaning of all dharmas arising from conditions.

['ZH_T36_1736_048:0373c04_5']	虛空如來佛性不從緣生，是故名常，則無為非因緣。	虛空如來佛性不從緣生，是故名常，則無為非因緣。	Space, the Tathagata, and Buddha-nature do not arise from conditions, therefore they are called permanent, and are unconditioned and not causes and conditions.
