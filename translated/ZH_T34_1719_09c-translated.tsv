['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b10_11']	近代翻譯法報不分、三二莫辯，自古經論許有三身，若言毘盧與舍那不別，則法身即是報身；	近代翻譯法報不分、三二莫辯，自古經論許有三身，若言毘盧與舍那不別，則法身即是報身；	09c	In recent translations, Dharma-body and Reward-body are not distinguished, and the three and two bodies are not clearly distinguished. The sūtras and śāstras of the past allow for the existence of three bodies. If it is said that Vairocana and Śākyamuni are not different, then the Dharma-body is the same as the Reward-body.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b11_16']	若即是者，一切眾生無不圓滿，若法身有說眾生亦然。	若即是者，一切眾生無不圓滿，若法身有說眾生亦然。	09c	If they are the same, then all sentient beings are already perfect. If the Dharma-body preaches, then sentient beings do so as well.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b12_9']	若果滿方說，滿從報立。	若果滿方說，滿從報立。	09c	If it is said that one preaches only after attaining Buddhahood, then perfection is established based on the Reward-body.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b13_4']	若言不離，三身俱然，何獨法報？	若言不離，三身俱然，何獨法報？	09c	If it is said that they are not separate, then the three bodies are all so. Why only the Dharma-body and Reward-body?
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b13_14']	生佛無二，豈唯三身？	生佛無二，豈唯三身？	09c	If Buddhas and sentient beings are non-dual, then it is not only the three bodies.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b16_20']	故存三身，法定不說，報通二義應化定說，若其相即俱說俱不說，若但從理非說非不說，事理相對無說即說、即說無說，情通妙契、諍計咸失。	故存三身，法定不說，報通二義應化定說，若其相即俱說俱不說，若但從理非說非不說，事理相對無說即說、即說無說，情通妙契、諍計咸失。	09c	Therefore, the three bodies are maintained. The Dharma-body definitely does not preach. The Reward-body has two meanings. The Response-body definitely preaches. If they are mutually inclusive, then both preaching and not preaching exist. If one only follows principle, then there is neither preaching nor not preaching. When principle and phenomena are opposed, non-preaching is preaching, and preaching is non-preaching. If one's feelings accord with the wondrous, then one attains. If one disputes and clings, then one loses.

Sentient beings transmigrate like the burning stone, and are not satisfied with the burning of the five desires. Only the Buddha can save them, and therefore it is said.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b25_4']	前二身名一切常定，故應身名十方各有不可說佛剎微塵名號，故彼品中新經云「釋迦如來亦名毘盧遮那」，舊經云「亦名盧舍那」，舊經意明應身異名，故總彼二經三名具足其體本一。	前二身名一切常定，故應身名十方各有不可說佛剎微塵名號，故彼品中新經云「釋迦如來亦名毘盧遮那」，舊經云「亦名盧舍那」，舊經意明應身異名，故總彼二經三名具足其體本一。	09c	The names of the first two bodies are all permanent, so the name of the reward body is that in the ten directions there are innumerable buddha lands and dusts with names, and therefore the chapter says that Shakyamuni Tathagata is also called Vairocana, and the old sutra says he is also called Vairocana. The meaning of the old sutra is to clarify that the reward body has different names, and therefore the two sutras together have three names in full, and their essence is originally one.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b26_11']	但新經意以毘盧為舍那，舊經直舉他受用報，義復何失？	但新經意以毘盧為舍那，舊經直舉他受用報，義復何失？	09c	But the meaning of the new sutra is to take Vairocana as Vairocana, and the old sutra directly mentions the other-enjoyment reward body. What is wrong with this meaning?

['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330b29_2']	引經中二：	引經中二：	09c	In citing the sutras, there are two:
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c01_7']	先引《大經》者，意明三德秖是三身，三身具如諸文所釋。	先引《大經》者，意明三德秖是三身，三身具如諸文所釋。	09c	First, citing the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, the meaning is to clarify that the three virtues are precisely the three bodies. The three bodies are fully explained in various texts.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c04_15']	引《梵網》等三結經者，以義大旨與三經同，而義意撮要，若《華嚴》中十方臺葉互為主伴，此《梵網經》唯一臺葉，故天台戒疏判云，華臺華葉本迹之殊。	引《梵網》等三結經者，以義大旨與三經同，而義意撮要，若《華嚴》中十方臺葉互為主伴，此《梵網經》唯一臺葉，故天台戒疏判云，華臺華葉本迹之殊。	09c	Citing the Brahmā's Net Sūtra and other three concluding sutras, the great purport of the meaning is the same as the three sutras, and the meaning is summarized. If in the Huayan, the platforms and leaves in the ten directions mutually serve as the primary and secondary, this Brahmā's Net Sūtra only has one platform and leaf, therefore Tiantai's commentary on the precepts judges it as the difference between the original and trace of the flower platform and flower leaves.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c06_7']	所以華臺華葉本迹定者，被緣雖別道理恒同，所結既同能結豈別？	所以華臺華葉本迹定者，被緣雖別道理恒同，所結既同能結豈別？	09c	The reason why the original and trace of the flower platform and flower leaves are determined is that although the circumstances are different, the principle is always the same. Since the conclusion is the same, how can the means of conclusion be different?
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c07_2']	《像法決疑》意亦同於所結故也。	《像法決疑》意亦同於所結故也。	09c	The meaning of the Sutra of Resolving Doubts in the Semblance Dharma is also the same as the conclusion.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c07_14']	「普賢觀云」，準上可知。	「普賢觀云」，準上可知。	09c	The Universal Worthy Contemplation Sutra says - the standard can be known from above.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c08_2']	結與釋妨，文相可知。	結與釋妨，文相可知。	09c	The conclusion and the explanation of difficulties, the text can be understood.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c10_3']	「若但」下約修性縱、橫、不縱不橫以判圓別者，即是約教，於中先別、次圓，後以藏通況之。	「若但」下約修性縱、橫、不縱不橫以判圓別者，即是約教，於中先別、次圓，後以藏通況之。	09c	If only below, it is about the vertical, horizontal, neither vertical nor horizontal of cultivation and nature to distinguish the perfect and the separate, which is the same as the teaching. In it, first the separate, then the perfect, and finally the hidden meaning of the Tripitaka and Shared teachings.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c10_17']	言「修縱性橫」者，非圓妙也。	言「修縱性橫」者，非圓妙也。	09c	It is said that cultivation is vertical and nature is horizontal is not the perfect subtlety.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c12_11']	性德之名名通別教，別教雖有性德之語，三皆在性而不互融，故成別義。	性德之名名通別教，別教雖有性德之語，三皆在性而不互融，故成別義。	09c	The name of the nature virtue is named in the separate teaching. Although the separate teaching has the words of nature virtue, the three are all in the nature and do not interpenetrate, so it becomes the separate meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c13_19']	若三皆在修，前後而得，道理成縱，具如《止觀》第三及記。	若三皆在修，前後而得，道理成縱，具如《止觀》第三及記。	09c	If the three are all in cultivation, they are obtained before and after, and the principle becomes vertical, as fully explained in the third chapter of the Mohezhiguan and its commentary.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c14_18']	故知今經不說縱橫，若性若修三皆圓妙云云。	故知今經不說縱橫，若性若修三皆圓妙云云。	09c	Therefore, it is known that the present sutra does not speak of vertical or horizontal, whether in nature or cultivation, the three are all perfectly subtle.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c15_10']	「又法華」下明本迹也。	「又法華」下明本迹也。	09c	Moreover, the Lotus Sutra below clarifies the fundamental and traces.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c17_12']	先正示同異，爾前非不明圓三佛，但與法華迹門義同，非今品之三如來也，故云「永異」。	先正示同異，爾前非不明圓三佛，但與法華迹門義同，非今品之三如來也，故云「永異」。	09c	First, correctly demonstrating the similarities and differences, before this, it is not that the three Buddhas of the perfect teaching were not clarified, but they are the same as the traces of the Lotus Sutra, not the three Tathagatas of this chapter, therefore it says permanently different.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c17_14']	問：	問：	09c	Question:
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c19_2']	《論》中但指報為久遠，應指伽耶法非今昔，如何三佛悉指於本？	《論》中但指報為久遠，應指伽耶法非今昔，如何三佛悉指於本？	09c	In the treatise, it only points to the reward [body] as being distant, it should point to the Dharma of Gayā as not being of the present or past, how can all three Buddhas be pointed to as being the original?
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c19_4']	答：	答：	09c	Answer:
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c20_3']	《論》雖互指，理必咸通，豈昔有報而無餘二？	《論》雖互指，理必咸通，豈昔有報而無餘二？	09c	Although the treatise mutually points to them, the principle must be universally applicable. How could there be only the reward [body] in the past without the other two?
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c20_12']	豈今但應而無法報？	豈今但應而無法報？	09c	How could there be only the response [body] in the present without the Dharma and reward [bodies]?
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c22_11']	以中間今日悉具三身但自實成，望於中間今日所現身處，通屬應化故且對之。	以中間今日悉具三身但自實成，望於中間今日所現身處，通屬應化故且對之。	09c	Because the middle and present [bodies] all possess the three bodies, but only the true accomplishment, in relation to the places where the bodies manifested in the middle and present, they are all categorized as response and transformation, therefore they are simply opposed to each other.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c24_3']	又法身雖即不當今昔，約修相望還分近遠，下釋壽量可以準知。	又法身雖即不當今昔，約修相望還分近遠，下釋壽量可以準知。	09c	Moreover, although the Dharma body is not of the present or past, in terms of the characteristics of cultivation, it is still divided into near and far. The explanation of the life span can be understood by analogy.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c24_13']	故今日中間節節具三。	故今日中間節節具三。	09c	Therefore, the middle and present [bodies] all possess the three [bodies] in each stage.

['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0330c28_1']	故釋壽量中各具足三義，於中先略釋壽，次廣釋量，此是壽家之量，故廣釋量即是廣壽。	故釋壽量中各具足三義，於中先略釋壽，次廣釋量，此是壽家之量，故廣釋量即是廣壽。	09c	Therefore, in explaining the life span, each is fully endowed with the three meanings. First, briefly explaining life, next, extensively explaining the measure, this is the measure of life, therefore, extensively explaining the measure is the same as extensively explaining life.

In reality, it still needs to be distinguished as the same or different. Because the vajra and ordinary people are different at each stage, the response body is the third sentence.
['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0331b14_13']	言「通途」者，欲以四句收一切故，故以第一句自金剛來，通及凡夫，故非佛之言所攝該廣，況復凡夫亦得以為三身之本，故入初句。	言「通途」者，欲以四句收一切故，故以第一句自金剛來，通及凡夫，故非佛之言所攝該廣，況復凡夫亦得以為三身之本，故入初句。	09c	As for general route, it is because it wants to include everything with four sentences, so the first sentence itself comes from the vajra, and extends to ordinary people.

['ZH_T34_1719_09c:0331b24_7']	言「別教」者，三身別別各對句故，故是別教分別之相。	言「別教」者，三身別別各對句故，故是別教分別之相。	09c	As for separate teaching, the three bodies are separately and individually corresponding to the phrases, so this is the aspect of discrimination in the separate teaching.

Moreover, the three bodies of inherent virtues are fully endowed with all the statements.

It discusses the general and specific based on sequence and non-sequence. Whether general or specific, they are both inconceivable. It is just that the appearance and usage of the provisional teachings are different, resulting in the general and specific.

The small are in these three and do not need the three evils either, so it is temporarily cited as the same.

Seeing a part of the Dharma body, one should naturally be able to hear the long-distant [attainment of Buddhahood]. Therefore, the previous text says that those on the grounds and above can hear the eternal, so the eternal is just different from other times, and therefore it is discussed again.

In the gradual, the sharp and dull are only called the Tripiṭaka and Shared means that the gradual universally includes the four.

As for saying the result of impermanence is manifest, from the perspective of the middle, both kinds of death are impermanent.

These four phrases all form a double negation. This statement of double negation, if concluded as such, forms a comprehensive statement.
