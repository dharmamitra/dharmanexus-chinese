Using this gate of the essence and function of the fundamental wisdom of all buddhas and all sentient beings, it serves as the essence and function of the cause and effect for all faithful ones, causing them to rely on the basis.

It is only because of the habitual familiarity with beginningless ignorance that it is difficult to suddenly accord with the pure and mature principle, so there is gradual progress.

It clarifies that the east governs the Zhen hexagram, which is thunderous movement, the beginning of awakening from hibernation and giving birth. It clarifies that this sublime wisdom is the beginning of the thunderous movement and giving rise to the ten faiths. Therefore, it is also called the Bodhisattva of Sublime Birth, in order to clarify that all buddhas are born from this wisdom and the ten faith-understandings, and so forth, up to the fulfillment of the ocean of all vows and practices of enlightenment.

Like an echo responding to sound, there is no location or form that can be obtained, which is called wisdom.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0823b01_1', 'ZH_T36_1739_016:0823b03_4', 'ZH_T36_1739_016:0823b04_10']	無可取捨故，名為不動。🔽三配當位因果者，妙慧為因，不動智為果，亦互為因果。🔽若以妙慧善簡擇法顯智故，即以妙慧為因，不動智為果。	無可取捨故，名為不動。 三配當位因果者，妙慧為因，不動智為果，亦互為因果。 若以妙慧善簡擇法顯智故，即以妙慧為因，不動智為果。	There is nothing to accept or reject, so it is called unmoving.🔽Third, matching the causal stage and fruition stage, wondrous wisdom is the cause, and unmoving wisdom is the fruition, which are also mutually causal.🔽If one uses wondrous wisdom to skillfully discern dharmas to manifest wisdom, then wondrous wisdom is the cause and unmoving wisdom is the fruition.

['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825b06_10']	二者能止方便，謂慚愧悔過，能止一切惡法不令增長，隨順法性離諸過故。	二者能止方便，謂慚愧悔過，能止一切惡法不令增長，隨順法性離諸過故。	Second, the skillful means of cessation, which means feeling shame and remorse, able to cease all unwholesome dharmas and prevent them from increasing, because in accordance with the nature of dharmas one is free from faults.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825b09_5']	三者發起善根增長方便，謂勤供養禮拜三寶，讚歎隨喜勸請諸佛，以愛敬三寶淳厚心故信得增長，乃能志求無上之道。	三者發起善根增長方便，謂勤供養禮拜三寶，讚歎隨喜勸請諸佛，以愛敬三寶淳厚心故信得增長，乃能志求無上之道。	Third, the expedient of arousing and increasing wholesome roots, which means diligently making offerings, prostrations, and praises to the Three Jewels, rejoicing in and requesting the Buddhas, because of the sincere mind of loving respect for the Three Jewels, faith increases and one is able to aspire to the unsurpassed way.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825b10_16']	又因佛法僧力所護故，能消業障、善根不退，以隨順法性離癡障故。	又因佛法僧力所護故，能消業障、善根不退，以隨順法性離癡障故。	Moreover, because of being protected by the power of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, one is able to eliminate karmic hindrances and wholesome roots do not regress, because of being in accord with the nature of dharmas and being free from the hindrances of delusion.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825b12_14']	四者大願平等方便，所謂發願盡於未來化度一切眾生使無有餘，皆令究竟無餘涅槃。	四者大願平等方便，所謂發願盡於未來化度一切眾生使無有餘，皆令究竟無餘涅槃。	Fourth, the expedient of great vows and equality, which means making vows to exhaust the future, liberating all sentient beings without remainder, and causing them all to ultimately attain nirvāṇa without remainder.

When the mind of initial resolve is first given rise to, it is based on the fruition of the Tathāgata's initial perfect enlightenment in the first assembly, and the inexhaustible layers of the Dharma realm and pores of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, and gives rise to the mind of faith in accordance with the fruition of practice based on fundamental wisdom, believing in the fruition attained by other buddhas.

The chapter on the four noble truths immediately clarifies the Dharma gates spoken by the buddhas of the three times, pervading the realm of sentient beings and following the different names of the realms. The chapter on the enlightenment of light immediately clarifies the realm of the wisdom and light of the tathagatas, pervading the Dharma realm without end, causing those who give rise to the mind of faith to contemplate it with contemplation, causing the mind to be as vast as the realm of the buddhas.

['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825c11_12']	此〈賢首品〉明十信心所欣佛果功德無有盡極，明初發十信心誦持此品功德，勝過供養十佛剎微塵數佛經於一劫，何況隨其解行而已修治。	此〈賢首品〉明十信心所欣佛果功德無有盡極，明初發十信心誦持此品功德，勝過供養十佛剎微塵數佛經於一劫，何況隨其解行而已修治。	This chapter on the head of the sages clarifies the inexhaustible merits of the Buddha-fruit that is delighted in by the ten stages of faith, and clarifies the merits of reciting and upholding this chapter from the initial arousal of the ten stages of faith, which surpass the merits of making offerings to buddhas equal to the dust motes in ten buddha-fields for an eon, let alone cultivating according to one's understanding and practice.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825c12_16']	如此經十住初心纔發心時，法爾身遍十方示成正覺。	如此經十住初心纔發心時，法爾身遍十方示成正覺。	In this sutra, the initial arousal of the mind in the ten abodes of faith is the dharma of the body pervading the ten directions and manifesting perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825c13_20']	在十住位〈發心功德品〉中，至位方明，文繁不引。	在十住位〈發心功德品〉中，至位方明，文繁不引。	In the chapter on the merits of arousing the mind in the ten abodes, it is clarified upon reaching that stage, but the text is omitted due to verbosity.

It simply gives rise to the mind of enlightenment without relying on anything.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825c21_4']	但以一切智發菩提心，不如三乘依猗物故發菩提心，不依三祇劫後有佛果故發菩提心，不依現在三世有佛果故發菩提心。	但以一切智發菩提心，不如三乘依猗物故發菩提心，不依三祇劫後有佛果故發菩提心，不依現在三世有佛果故發菩提心。	It simply gives rise to the mind of enlightenment with omniscience, unlike the three vehicles that give rise to the mind of enlightenment relying on and leaning on things. It does not give rise to the mind of enlightenment relying on the Buddha-fruit after three incalculable eons, and it does not give rise to the mind of enlightenment relying on the Buddha-fruit in the present three times.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825c21_19']	以是義故，入此信者皆無有退故。	以是義故，入此信者皆無有退故。	For this reason, those who enter this faith all have no regression.

['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825c26_15']	以十方諸佛無依住智幻住莊嚴門，等法界虛空界，法性恒遍十方，如影對現色身，同自身故、本不二故、體無差別故。	以十方諸佛無依住智幻住莊嚴門，等法界虛空界，法性恒遍十方，如影對現色身，同自身故、本不二故、體無差別故。	Using the gate of the illusory adornments of the non-abiding wisdom of the Buddhas of the ten directions, equal to the Dharma realm and the realm of space, the Dharma nature always pervades the ten directions, like a shadow appearing in response to form, because it is the same as one's own body, because it is originally non-dual, and because the essence is without distinction.
['ZH_T36_1739_016:0825c27_18']	十方諸佛智身如影、所言如響，如是信解當得成佛。	十方諸佛智身如影、所言如響，如是信解當得成佛。	The wisdom body of the Buddhas of the ten directions is like a shadow, and what is said is like an echo. Having such faith and understanding, one will attain Buddhahood.
