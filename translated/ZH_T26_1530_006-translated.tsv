It also assists the Tathāgata's wisdom of accomplishing activities as the dominant condition.

['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317a17_8']	如是如來妙觀察智，五趣因果為境界故，似其五趣因果二相差別顯現，非生五趣。	如是如來妙觀察智，五趣因果為境界故，似其五趣因果二相差別顯現，非生五趣。	In the same way, the wondrous observation knowledge of a Tathāgata, because the causes and effects of the five destinies are its objects, manifests the two aspects of the causes and effects of the five destinies in a way that is similar to them, but it does not produce the five destinies.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317a18_12']	諸阿素洛種類不定，或天或鬼，或復傍生，故不別說。	諸阿素洛種類不定，或天或鬼，或復傍生，故不別說。	The various kinds of asuras are not fixed as either gods, ghosts, or animals, and therefore they are not mentioned separately.

['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317a28_9']	此中世界通情非情，謂有情世界及器世界。	此中世界通情非情，謂有情世界及器世界。	Herein, the world includes both sentient and insentient beings, namely the world of sentient beings and the world of the container.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b01_3']	若不爾者，不應於中有無色界，以彼唯有定所生色，無業生色、無方處故。	若不爾者，不應於中有無色界，以彼唯有定所生色，無業生色、無方處故。	If it were not so, then in the formless realm there should not be the formless realm, because it only has form produced by concentration, not form produced by karma, and because it has no location.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b02_12']	於世界中，隨其所應建立三界，謂器世界中但有欲色情非情界。	於世界中，隨其所應建立三界，謂器世界中但有欲色情非情界。	In the world, according to what is appropriate, the three realms are established. In the world of the container, there are only the realms of desire and form, both sentient and insentient.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b04_15']	有情界中具有三種，唯有情界以器世界通持有情及非情界，有情世界唯能任持有情界故。	有情界中具有三種，唯有情界以器世界通持有情及非情界，有情世界唯能任持有情界故。	Sentient beings have all three kinds of worlds. Only the world of sentient beings can contain both sentient and nonsentient beings, because the world of sentient beings can contain only sentient beings.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b07_3']	如是如來妙觀察智，三界因果為境界故，似其三界因果二相差別顯現，非生三界因果，同前二種分別。	如是如來妙觀察智，三界因果為境界故，似其三界因果二相差別顯現，非生三界因果，同前二種分別。	Thus the wondrous observation knowledge of a Tathāgata, because the three worlds of cause and effect are its object, manifests images of the two aspects of the three worlds of cause and effect, but it does not produce the three worlds of cause and effect, unlike the previous two kinds of knowledge.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b09_14']	此中意說，妙觀察智普能觀察一切境故，遍似一切諸界趣生，煩惱業等所感諸行成熟所攝心心法等因果相現。	此中意說，妙觀察智普能觀察一切境故，遍似一切諸界趣生，煩惱業等所感諸行成熟所攝心心法等因果相現。	The meaning here is that because wondrous observation knowledge universally observes all objects, it universally manifests images of all the worlds, destinies, and lives, and the causes and effects of mind and mental activities that are included in the maturation of all practices produced by passions, actions, etc.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b14_1']	謂諸如來大圓鏡智，增上所生妙觀察智，雖無所取能取執著，遠離一切煩惱所知二垢障故，觀察一切因果等事，及能說故，如淨圓鏡現眾影像，一切境相皆現其中，然無鏡智無差別過。	謂諸如來大圓鏡智，增上所生妙觀察智，雖無所取能取執著，遠離一切煩惱所知二垢障故，觀察一切因果等事，及能說故，如淨圓鏡現眾影像，一切境相皆現其中，然無鏡智無差別過。	That is, the great perfect mirror cognition of the tathāgatas, which is the marvelous observing cognition that arises from the dominant condition, although it is free from the attachment of the grasped and grasper, and is far removed from the two hindrances of the afflictions and the knowable because it observes all things such as causes and effects and is able to expound them, is like a pure perfect mirror that manifests many images. All the characteristics of objects are manifested within it, yet mirror cognition is without the fault of discrimination.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b15_12']	大圓鏡智以於一切皆不愚故，雖能顯現一切影像任運轉故而無分別。	大圓鏡智以於一切皆不愚故，雖能顯現一切影像任運轉故而無分別。	Because the great perfect mirror cognition is not ignorant of anything, although it is able to manifest all images it functions spontaneously and is without discrimination.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b17_11']	此智能現一切境相亦有分別，若無分別則不能觀因果等事，及為眾會說法斷疑。	此智能現一切境相亦有分別，若無分別則不能觀因果等事，及為眾會說法斷疑。	This cognition is able to manifest all the characteristics of objects and is also discriminating. If it were without discrimination, then it would be unable to observe things such as causes and effects, and to expound the Dharma to the assembly and resolve doubts.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b19_4']	此文定證無漏心等亦有相分，如來智上五趣三界無邊因果具足現故。	此文定證無漏心等亦有相分，如來智上五趣三界無邊因果具足現故。	This text definitely proves that even the pure mind, etc., also has an image part, because the boundless causes and effects of the five destinies and three realms are completely manifested in the cognition of the Tathāgata.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b21_11']	有說，如來智明淨故，一切境相雖現其中，而此境相非智所變，不清淨故，但是眾生心等所變諸法影像。	有說，如來智明淨故，一切境相雖現其中，而此境相非智所變，不清淨故，但是眾生心等所變諸法影像。	Some say that because the wisdom of a Tathāgata is clear and pure, although all objective images appear within it, these objective images are not transformed by wisdom, because they are not pure. They are only the images of dharmas transformed by the minds, etc., of sentient beings.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b23_1']	此不應理，如是影像若是眾生心等所變，云何在佛智上顯現？	此不應理，如是影像若是眾生心等所變，云何在佛智上顯現？	This is unreasonable, because if these images are transformed by the minds, etc., of sentient beings, how can they appear in the wisdom of a Buddha?
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b23_15']	不可他因生他心相，違正理故。	不可他因生他心相，違正理故。	It is impossible for the images of one mind to arise from the causes of another mind, because this contradicts correct reasoning.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b24_6']	如餘心相，此亦應爾。	如餘心相，此亦應爾。	They must be like the images of other minds.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b25_17']	然此境相如來無漏心所變現，如明鏡中糞穢影像，雖似不淨實非不淨。	然此境相如來無漏心所變現，如明鏡中糞穢影像，雖似不淨實非不淨。	However, these objective images are manifested by the pure, transformed mind of a Tathāgata, just as the images of filth in a bright mirror, although appearing to be impure, are in reality not impure.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b26_7']	心及心法緣境法爾。	心及心法緣境法爾。	It is the nature of mind and mental activities to have objects as their objects.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b28_1']	若緣他境，非如鉗燈，無動作故，但如明鏡性本淨故，變似境相而能緣慮。	若緣他境，非如鉗燈，無動作故，但如明鏡性本淨故，變似境相而能緣慮。	If they have the objects of another as their objects, they are not like a pair of tongs or a lamp, because they have no movement. They are only like a bright mirror, because their nature is originally pure. They transform and resemble the images of objects and are able to be aware of them.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317b29_15']	若諸境相非心上現，彼雖有力生心心所，如五根等不名所緣，如餘處說。	若諸境相非心上現，彼雖有力生心心所，如五根等不名所緣，如餘處說。	If the characteristics of objects do not appear in the mind, even though they have the power to generate mind and mental activities, they are not called objects, like the five organs, etc., as explained elsewhere.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c01_5']	無分別智亦定爾耶？	無分別智亦定爾耶？	Is it definitely the same with nondiscriminative knowledge?
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c01_19']	所緣真如不離智體，不可定爾。	所緣真如不離智體，不可定爾。	The object, true suchness, is not separate from the substance of knowledge, so it cannot be definitely the same.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c03_12']	後得俗智雖不離真，有分別故不證真體，但自變作真相而緣，故不可難。	後得俗智雖不離真，有分別故不證真體，但自變作真相而緣，故不可難。	Subsequently acquired knowledge of the conventional, although not separate from the true, is not able to realize the substance of the true because it is discriminative. It only transforms itself into the characteristics of the true and takes that as an object. Therefore it cannot be criticized.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c05_2']	如諸異生心緣無漏心上所有無漏境相，雖似無漏實是有漏。	如諸異生心緣無漏心上所有無漏境相，雖似無漏實是有漏。	It is like the minds of ordinary beings that take as objects the characteristics of the pure object that exist in the pure mind. Although they resemble the pure, they are actually impure.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c06_9']	此亦應爾，唯識道理決定如是，心所變相雖相似有而實無體。	此亦應爾，唯識道理決定如是，心所變相雖相似有而實無體。	This is also the case with subsequently acquired knowledge. The principle of consciousness only is definitely like this. Although the characteristics of the objects transformed by mind and mental activities are similar and existent, they are actually without substance.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c07_9']	若不爾者，應有色等如心心法，不成唯識。	若不爾者，應有色等如心心法，不成唯識。	If this were not so, there would be form, etc., like mind and mental activities, and consciousness only would not be established.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c09_7']	若彼實有但不離識名唯識者，心及心法亦不離彼色等諸相，應名唯境，便成大過。	若彼實有但不離識名唯識者，心及心法亦不離彼色等諸相，應名唯境，便成大過。	If it is said that they are real but not separate from consciousness, and therefore only consciousness exists, then mind and mental factors are also not separate from their characteristics such as form, etc., and should be called only objects, which would be a grave error.

['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c12_8']	如是如來觀察智上，諸佛菩薩威神所引，廣大甚深教法可得。	如是如來觀察智上，諸佛菩薩威神所引，廣大甚深教法可得。	In the same way, in the Tathāgata's observation wisdom, the vast and profound teachings can be obtained, drawn by the spiritual powers of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

These teachings reveal the spiritual powers of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and are also able to draw forth their spiritual powers. Therefore, they are said to be drawn by the spiritual powers of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c20_18']	此說如來妙觀察智能發鏡智相應識上教法影像，或自能現教法影像，由此為緣善根成熟所化有情自心變現。	此說如來妙觀察智能發鏡智相應識上教法影像，或自能現教法影像，由此為緣善根成熟所化有情自心變現。	This explains that the Tathāgata's marvelous observation wisdom can give rise to the reflection-like images of the teachings on the consciousnesses associated with mirror wisdom, or it can itself manifest the reflection-like images of the teachings, and on this basis, the wholesome roots of those to be converted mature and their own minds manifest.

['ZH_T26_1530_006:0317c28_8']	法界則是空無相理，說法界理名法界教。	法界則是空無相理，說法界理名法界教。	The Dharma realm is precisely the principle of emptiness and signlessness. Expounding the principle of the Dharma realm is called the teachings of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T26_1530_006:0318a01_7']	諸外道等皆依諸見，法界空理對治諸見離諸見趣，是故空教彼不能測，不能傾動。	諸外道等皆依諸見，法界空理對治諸見離諸見趣，是故空教彼不能測，不能傾動。	All non-Buddhists rely on various views. The principle of emptiness of the dharma realm counteracts various views and is free from the tendencies of various views. Therefore, the teaching of emptiness cannot be fathomed by them and cannot be shaken.

This dharma realm teaching, because the dharma realm is extremely profound, is likened to a great ocean. The wonderful observation cognition is the cause that can reveal and illuminate all realms, and therefore it can give rise to the teaching of all dharmas. The brief explanation of the superior ones.
