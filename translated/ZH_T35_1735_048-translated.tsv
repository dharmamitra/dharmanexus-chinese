Using the person to manifest the Dharma is the practice of Samantabhadra;

['ZH_T35_1735_048:0870b08_2']	三遠通差別因果，雖有圓融之義，以五位漸次因果殊分，逐機就病未盡法源故名少分，則顯下平等因果逐法性說，因果圓融，名廣大說。	三遠通差別因果，雖有圓融之義，以五位漸次因果殊分，逐機就病未盡法源故名少分，則顯下平等因果逐法性說，因果圓融，名廣大說。	Three, it extends to the differentiated causes and effects, although there is the meaning of perfect interfusion, as the causes and effects of the five stages are distinguished in sequence, and the teachings are not yet complete according to the capacities and illnesses of sentient beings, so it is called lesser. It then shows that the following equal causes and effects are explained according to the nature of phenomena, with the perfect interfusion of causes and effects called extensive explanation.
['ZH_T35_1735_048:0870b08_11']	二徵釋中，徵意云：	二徵釋中，徵意云：	In the second part, the question is:

The reason why the Buddhas appear in the world is because sentient beings have the ten faults such as ignorance, and it is not yet appropriate to explain them in detail, so the distinctions, etc. are explained first.
['ZH_T35_1735_048:0870b13_9']	二者生後，謂眾生既過滋多、障累無盡，則一治一切治、一現一切現，眾生無盡，因果亦窮未來際。	二者生後，謂眾生既過滋多、障累無盡，則一治一切治、一現一切現，眾生無盡，因果亦窮未來際。	Second, it gives rise to the following. It means that since the faults of sentient beings are already numerous and their hindrances are inexhaustible, then one treatment is all treatments, one appearance is all appearances, and sentient beings are inexhaustible, and cause and effect also extends to the end of the future.
['ZH_T35_1735_048:0870b14_1']	前之所隨，由未盡故。	前之所隨，由未盡故。	The preceding faults have not yet been exhausted.
