['ZH_T29_1563_035:0946c19_2']	諸忍正起推度意樂，加行猛利故非智攝，而名見者，推度性故。	諸忍正起推度意樂，加行猛利故非智攝，而名見者，推度性故。	035	Because the intention of investigation is active when patience is being produced, and the effort is intense, it is not categorized as knowledge. It is called seeing because its nature is that of investigation.

['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a01_16']	餘解脫等非全息求，所起加行非極奢緩，以皆於後有所作故。	餘解脫等非全息求，所起加行非極奢緩，以皆於後有所作故。	035	The remaining paths of liberation, etc., do not completely stop seeking, and the practice that they generate is neither extremely relaxed, because they all have something to be done later.

['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a07_13']	此亦不然，不應許故、非決定故、契經說故。	此亦不然，不應許故、非決定故、契經說故。	035	This is not so, because it should not be admitted, because it is not certain, and because it is so stated in the scriptures.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a09_1']	謂不應許，唯內門轉方是見性，勿聖慧中外身念住非見性攝。	謂不應許，唯內門轉方是見性，勿聖慧中外身念住非見性攝。	035	That is, it should not be admitted that only that which evolves internally is of the nature of views, lest the mindfulness of the external body in holy wisdom not be categorized as views.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a09_6']	然契經說：	然契經說：	035	However, a scripture says,
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a09_17']	於外身循身觀是見性攝。	於外身循身觀是見性攝。	035	“The contemplation of the body in the external body is categorized as views.”
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a10_10']	亦非決定如五識身所引意識。	亦非決定如五識身所引意識。	035	It is also not certain that the mind consciousness that is elicited is of the same nature as the five consciousnesses that elicit it,
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a12_14']	如是性轉，以彼善等所引意識有時亦是不善等故，由此不應所引意識同能引五識是無分別性。	如是性轉，以彼善等所引意識有時亦是不善等故，由此不應所引意識同能引五識是無分別性。	035	because sometimes the mind consciousness elicited by good, etc., is not good, etc. Consequently, the mind consciousness that is elicited is not necessarily of the same nature as the five consciousnesses that elicit it and is not of the nature of non-discrimination.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a13_1']	如契經說：	如契經說：	035	As a scripture says,

['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a14_13']	善心心所故說所有意地善慧皆見性攝，於理為善。	善心心所故說所有意地善慧皆見性攝，於理為善。	035	Therefore it is said that all good mental activities are included in the category of seeing. This is good reasoning.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a15_12']	如是所說聖有漏慧，皆擇法故並慧性攝。	如是所說聖有漏慧，皆擇法故並慧性攝。	035	The holy wisdom that has been discussed above, whether impure or pure, is all included in the category of discernment, because it discerns and selects dharmas.

['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a24_11']	如是十智總唯二種，有漏、無漏性差別故。	如是十智總唯二種，有漏、無漏性差別故。	035	These ten knowledges are generally of two kinds, because of the difference of being impure or pure.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a25_10']	如是二智相別有三，謂世俗智、法智、類智。	如是二智相別有三，謂世俗智、法智、類智。	035	These two knowledges are distinguished as three: conventional knowledge, knowledge of dharmas, and inferential knowledge.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947a26_16']	前有漏智總名世俗，瓶衣等物性可毀壞，顯在俗情故名世俗。	前有漏智總名世俗，瓶衣等物性可毀壞，顯在俗情故名世俗。	035	The former contaminated knowledge is generally called conventional, because things such as vases and clothing are by nature subject to destruction and appear in worldly minds, and so are called conventional.

['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b08_8']	或復此智於一切境能遍映發，得世俗名，獨能遍緣一切法故。	或復此智於一切境能遍映發，得世俗名，獨能遍緣一切法故。	035	Or, it is called conventional knowledge because it is able to illuminate all objects, because it is the only one that is able to universally take all dharmas as objects.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b09_7']	後無漏智分為二種，法、類二名所目別故。	後無漏智分為二種，法、類二名所目別故。	035	The last pure knowledge is divided into two kinds, because it is referred to by the two names of knowledge of dharmas and knowledge of species.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b09_17']	此二名義，如前已釋。	此二名義，如前已釋。	035	The meanings of these two names have already been explained above.

['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b12_5']	無漏於境行相明利，彼有漏智與此相違。	無漏於境行相明利，彼有漏智與此相違。	035	Pure knowledge is clear and sharp in its activity with regard to objects, while impure knowledge is the opposite.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b13_4']	如朅地羅餘木二炭，於所燒煉勢用不同。	如朅地羅餘木二炭，於所燒煉勢用不同。	035	It is like the difference in the power of burning between black and white charcoal.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b14_12']	及勝劣香能熏用別，炎鐵草火熱勢有殊，二智相望差別亦爾。	及勝劣香能熏用別，炎鐵草火熱勢有殊，二智相望差別亦爾。	035	and superior and inferior smells have different perfuming functions. The heat of burning iron and grass fires is different. The difference between the two knowledges is also like this.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b15_12']	或俗智後起增上慢，無漏不然，故有差別。	或俗智後起增上慢，無漏不然，故有差別。	035	Or, after worldly knowledge, one gives rise to conceit, but the pure [knowledge] is not so, so there is a difference.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b16_10']	又世俗智與法類智，境有寬陜故有差別。	又世俗智與法類智，境有寬陜故有差別。	035	Also, worldly knowledge and knowledge of dharmas and kinds have different scopes of objects, so there is a difference.
['ZH_T29_1563_035:0947b17_9']	謂世俗智遍以一切有為無為為所緣境。	謂世俗智遍以一切有為無為為所緣境。	035	That is to say, worldly knowledge universally takes all conditioned and unconditioned dharmas as its objects.

Therefore it definitely cannot have as its special object the mind and mental activities of another and thus constitute the knowledge of others’ minds.

Having generally seen or heard it, one is also interested in taking it as a specific object.

When it is of the middle grade, it can also know the mind of its own stage that is of the middle grade. When it is of the upper grade, it can know the three kinds of minds of its own stage and the lower stage.

There is not even one person who accomplishes two grades of faculties, much less three. Therefore there is a difference.

The same is true of the relationship between the various stages and faculties.

When the knowledge of cessation and of the path with regard to the desire realm arises, it can universally cause the mind to be separated from the defilements of the three realms.

A small part of the knowledge of the dharma has the ability to eliminate the higher realms, but the knowledge of the species definitely has no ability to eliminate the desire realm. One must have completed one's own work in one's own realm before one can also do the work for other realms. When the knowledge of the species has accomplished its own task, there is no meaning of needing to assist in the task of others that has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, there is no knowledge of the species that eliminates the dharmas of the desire realm.

['ZH_T29_1563_035:0949b13_9']	將斷欲惑，類智不行。	將斷欲惑，類智不行。	035	When one is about to eliminate the afflictions of the desire realm, the knowledge of the species does not operate.

Consequently, the knowledge of the class of the desire realm is not able to counteract the desire realm.
