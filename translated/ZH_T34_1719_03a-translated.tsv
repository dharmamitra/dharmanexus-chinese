Although establishing the producer and the born together is called immeasurable, it is still not acceptable;
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b10_1']	若對異名能生之法名為實相，斯則可矣。	若對異名能生之法名為實相，斯則可矣。	If it is compared to a different name, the producing dharma is called the true aspect, then this is acceptable.

['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b11_19']	「無量義者從一法生」，生即所生，一法能生即實相也。	「無量義者從一法生」，生即所生，一法能生即實相也。	The immeasurable meaning arises from one dharma. The born is the born, and the one dharma that can produce is the true aspect.

['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b12_19']	故《論》云：	故《論》云：	Therefore, the treatise says:
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b16_10']	「此是如來欲說法時至成就」，既云「欲說」，非即全同，若其全同即是已說，故《論》存序，乃云欲說，意兼於正則為異名，論其二途今釋準彼，亦順下文三昧為歎。	「此是如來欲說法時至成就」，既云「欲說」，非即全同，若其全同即是已說，故《論》存序，乃云欲說，意兼於正則為異名，論其二途今釋準彼，亦順下文三昧為歎。	This is when the Tathagata's desire to speak the Dharma has been accomplished. Since it says desire to speak, it is not exactly the same. If it were exactly the same, then it would be the same as already spoken. Therefore, the treatise preserves the preface and says desire to speak. The meaning includes the correct and becomes a different name. Discussing the two paths, the present explanation is based on that, and also follows the praise of samadhi below.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b18_16']	若所入三昧唯依所生列名，秖應但云「無量」，故知經名文在所生，意兼能出，所入三昧義必雙含。	若所入三昧唯依所生列名，秖應但云「無量」，故知經名文在所生，意兼能出，所入三昧義必雙含。	If the samādhi one enters only lists the name based on what is produced, it should only be called immeasurable. Therefore, we know that the name of the sūtra is in what is produced, but the meaning includes both what is produced and what produces it.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b20_17']	所以前消論云「欲說此經先入此定」，今從經所表邊，復以義處歎之，及引文證全在此經。	所以前消論云「欲說此經先入此定」，今從經所表邊，復以義處歎之，及引文證全在此經。	The reason for the previous explanation of the treatise saying before expounding this sūtra, one first enters this samādhi is that now, from the perspective of what is indicated by the sūtra, it is praised with the meaning of the realm of truth, and the text is cited as evidence, all of which is in this sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b22_13']	「佛護念」者，果人所護既是能生無量義處，復是佛所證得，豈佛所證而非實相？	「佛護念」者，果人所護既是能生無量義處，復是佛所證得，豈佛所證而非實相？	The Buddha's protection and remembrance means that what is protected by the fruition person is already able to produce the realm of immeasurable meanings, and is also realized by the Buddha. How could what is realized by the Buddha not be the true aspect of reality?
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b23_4']	故引自住而以為證。	故引自住而以為證。	Therefore, he cites his own abiding as evidence.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b24_4']	昔未說故名之為護，約法約機皆護念故。	昔未說故名之為護，約法約機皆護念故。	Because it has not been expounded in the past, it is called protection. It is protected in terms of the Dharma and in terms of the capacity of beings.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b26_9']	從「雖欲」下明護念意，佛意本欲唯說能生，故說《無量義》時機仍未發，隱而不說，故云「護念」。	從「雖欲」下明護念意，佛意本欲唯說能生，故說《無量義》時機仍未發，隱而不說，故云「護念」。	From although he wishes below, it clarifies the meaning of protection and remembrance. The Buddha's original intention is only to expound what is able to produce, therefore, when expounding the Immeasurable Meaning, the capacity of beings has still not been aroused, and it is concealed and not expounded, thus it is called protection and remembrance.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b28_12']	「故無量義」下一護念言亦成兩向，但彼經文雖云從一出多，未云從多歸一，猶是覆相名為護念。	「故無量義」下一護念言亦成兩向，但彼經文雖云從一出多，未云從多歸一，猶是覆相名為護念。	Therefore, the phrase 'being mindful' in the chapter on Immeasurable Meanings also forms two directions, but the text of that sutra only says that one arises from many, and does not say that many return to one. It is still a concealed teaching called being mindful.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194b29_11']	若不爾者，則已說《法華》，何名為序？	若不爾者，則已說《法華》，何名為序？	If it were not so, then the Lotus Sutra would have already been taught, so how could it be called a preface?
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c01_5']	以未說故，故云「雖欲開示」等也。	以未說故，故云「雖欲開示」等也。	Because it has not yet been taught, it says although wanting to reveal and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c01_20']	以未說故「護」，未暢故「念」。	以未說故「護」，未暢故「念」。	Because it has not yet been taught, it is protected; because it has not yet been fully expressed, it is remembered.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c02_8']	言「久默」者，自昔至今。	言「久默」者，自昔至今。	As for keeping silent for a long time, it refers to the time from the past up to the present.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c02_19']	「斯要」等意思之可知。	「斯要」等意思之可知。	The meaning of this essential and so on can be understood.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c04_6']	若唯從所生非專佛護，在昔通說無時不然，故《法華論》云：	若唯從所生非專佛護，在昔通說無時不然，故《法華論》云：	If it only refers to what is produced, it is not exclusively the Buddha's protection. In the past, it was commonly said that there was nothing wrong with that. Therefore, the Fahua Lun says:
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c04_12']	「蓮華二義：	「蓮華二義：	The lotus has two meanings:
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c04_22']	一者出水，二者開敷。	一者出水，二者開敷。	First, emerging from the water; second, blooming.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c06_7']	」彼如出水、此若開敷，所以仍名為蓮故華，但有未開當開之別。	」彼如出水、此若開敷，所以仍名為蓮故華，但有未開當開之別。	That is like emerging from the water, while this is like blooming. The reason it is still called a lotus is because it is a flower. There is only a difference between not yet blooming and about to bloom.

['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c08_17']	先結入意，次「非禪」下釋結意，三「疑者」下釋疑。	先結入意，次「非禪」下釋結意，三「疑者」下釋疑。	First, it concludes the meaning of entry. Next, below not concentration, it explains the meaning of the conclusion. Third, below doubters, it explains doubts.

['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c11_12']	次明相即，即定慧體。	次明相即，即定慧體。	Next, it clarifies their mutual identity, which is the essence of concentration and wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c14_7']	初相成者，先說後定且從序說，先定後說如下釋疑，佛居果位必無先後，為順化儀現有先後，究而論之其體相即。	初相成者，先說後定且從序說，先定後說如下釋疑，佛居果位必無先後，為順化儀現有先後，究而論之其體相即。	The initial mutual accomplishment is that the explanation comes first and the concentration comes later, for the time being following the sequence of the preface. The concentration comes first and the explanation comes later, as will be explained below in resolving doubts. The Buddha resides in the fruition stage and must be without priority or posteriority, but in order to accord with the sequence of the teaching, he manifests priority and posteriority. If one investigates and discusses it, their essence is mutually identical.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c15_18']	次立疑者，且依序問，凡諸化儀，皆先定後說，此中何以先說後定？	次立疑者，且依序問，凡諸化儀，皆先定後說，此中何以先說後定？	Next, establishing doubts is for the time being based on the sequence of the questions. In all the sequences of the teaching, concentration always comes first and the explanation comes later. Why is it that in this case the explanation comes first and the concentration comes later?
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c17_16']	答中先順問答佛之常儀，次申定意，欲明一定義分兩途，次「說此」下述為序意。	答中先順問答佛之常儀，次申定意，欲明一定義分兩途，次「說此」下述為序意。	In the answer, first顺問答 the Buddha's usual method, next 申定意, wanting to clarify that one definite meaning is divided into two paths. Next, expounding this below describes the meaning of the preface.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c18_5']	今時何故先說後定？	今時何故先說後定？	Why is it that now, first expounding and then entering concentration?
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c19_13']	常儀說已即應眾散，更入此定肅其現眾，眾既不散得為今序。	常儀說已即應眾散，更入此定肅其現眾，眾既不散得為今序。	The usual method of expounding should immediately disperse the assembly, further entering this concentration to solemnize the present assembly. Since the assembly does not disperse, it can be the present preface.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c22_4']	次「何者」下述為正意，以一定中義兼二意，意雖復二，時眾但見無量義後即便入定，不知所入為是何定？	次「何者」下述為正意，以一定中義兼二意，意雖復二，時眾但見無量義後即便入定，不知所入為是何定？	Next, what is it? below describes the meaning of the main point. Using one definite meaning, the meaning is兼 two meanings. Although the meaning is two, the assembly only sees that after the Immeasurable Meaning, [the Buddha] immediately enters concentration, not knowing what concentration he enters.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c22_13']	不知定後為說何法？	不知定後為說何法？	Not knowing what Dharma he will expound after concentration.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c24_4']	故結集者復符佛旨，述所說經但云無量，述所入定即加其處。	故結集者復符佛旨，述所說經但云無量，述所入定即加其處。	Therefore, the compiler again follows the Buddha's meaning, describing the expounded sutra as only immeasurable, describing the entered concentration as immediately adding its location.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c24_18']	若從義處以出無量，顯成序意；	若從義處以出無量，顯成序意；	If from the meaning location, manifesting the immeasurable, it clarifies the preface meaning;

['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c26_5']	雖加義處眾亦莫知。	雖加義處眾亦莫知。	Although he added the meaning of the realm of phenomena, the assembly still did not know.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0194c28_5']	言「若作次第」等者，亦順化儀辨定先後，即以不次第而論次第，於佛內照豈可分張。	言「若作次第」等者，亦順化儀辨定先後，即以不次第而論次第，於佛內照豈可分張。	As for saying if one makes a sequence and so forth, it also distinguishes the priority in accordance with the method of transformation, and discusses the sequence in an unsequential manner. How can it be divided in the Buddha's internal illumination?
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0195a01_10']	「若明文」等者，謂如來當時不先示定體，故使彌勒勤勤置問，乃是經家於別序中且覆別以從通。	「若明文」等者，謂如來當時不先示定體，故使彌勒勤勤置問，乃是經家於別序中且覆別以從通。	As for saying if one clarifies the text and so forth, it means that at that time the Tathāgata did not first demonstrate the essence of samādhi, causing Maitreya to repeatedly ask questions. This is the compiler of the sūtra, who in the introductory section first covers the specific to follow the general.

['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0195a07_16']	故使今佛序定兼正，即成先定後說也。	故使今佛序定兼正，即成先定後說也。	Therefore, it causes the Buddha's introduction of concentration to be both preliminary and main, which then forms the sequence of concentration first and teaching later.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0195a08_7']	智定相成前後何在？	智定相成前後何在？	Wisdom and concentration mutually accomplish each other, how can there be a sequence of first and later?

First, it clarifies the reason for immobility, because attaining the perceived true aspect causes the body and mind to be unmoving.

Thus, the fundamental source and rational nature are both called the realm. In contrast to the provisional designation of body and mind, the Tathāgata truly realizes that form and mind are one. This form and mind are the three virtues. In order to explain the eternally wondrous and constant sutra that originally exists, he first uses the non-movement of form and mind to represent it.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0195a19_15']	又身之與心俱表示迹，今以迹表本故云「虛空常寂」。	又身之與心俱表示迹，今以迹表本故云「虛空常寂」。	Moreover, both the body and mind are provisional manifestations. Now, using the provisional to represent the fundamental, it is said to be always quiescent like empty space.

Those who study this school may sometimes also be confused by the four wheels in the Garland Sutra being the meaning of borrowing the separate [stages].

If one definitely determines, then before abiding it belongs to the wise. If one distinguishes with four phrases, it is only a matter of establishing the name of mutual attainment.

Although it is said to be one cause, one should recognize the essence of the cause. The bodhisattvas of the four teachings each look up to their Buddha, and they are all one cause. Because the causes of the one cause are different, the Xuanwen of the tenth chapter opens one from one and returns one to one.

It is also said to represent the One Vehicle, but this does not know that the Buddha acts without scheming, and by intentionally emitting it, it attributes the Buddha's effort.

The Buddha's wisdom has not yet been opened, so it is shown by the light illuminating the opening. The opening is specifically in the initial abode.

The text here takes this light-emitting passage to encompass both, so its textual force also includes long and short. If taken short, it is as listed above. If taken long, it must go to the Heaven of No Strife. Still, take this sixth as the general for others. If it is the general for others, it also has long and short. It should be understood by analogy.

This is because the meaning of stimulus and response is common to the three pairs. It is different from the first two pairs in this land, which are both in the response. Therefore, the third pair can be said to be stimulus and response.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0197b18_18']	又彼土瑞至第三雙生起中云「行始必終」者，但互舉耳，明菩薩有始而必終、如來已終而有始。	又彼土瑞至第三雙生起中云「行始必終」者，但互舉耳，明菩薩有始而必終、如來已終而有始。	Moreover, in the auspicious signs of that land, when it reaches the third pair in the arising, it says the beginning of practice must end. This is just a mutual reference, clarifying that the bodhisattva has a beginning but must end, and the Tathāgata has already ended but has a beginning.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0197b20_15']	又人法雙中雖人通鹿苑之未，法唯乳味之初，然法必有人、人必對法，故且對辨。	又人法雙中雖人通鹿苑之未，法唯乳味之初，然法必有人、人必對法，故且對辨。	Moreover, although the pair of person and Dharma in the person and Dharma pair is generally the person of the Deer Park who has not yet, the Dharma is only the initial taste of milk, the Dharma must have a person, and the person must correspond to the Dharma, so it is discussed by comparison.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0197b23_13']	又上下雙中雖上說被下，而被物未顯，即雖未顯始末由之，故得對之以論上下，況凡諸取對皆是一往，是故更須求其始終。	又上下雙中雖上說被下，而被物未顯，即雖未顯始末由之，故得對之以論上下，況凡諸取對皆是一往，是故更須求其始終。	Moreover, although the pair of above and below in the pair of above and below is said to be covered by the below, the manifestation of the covered objects is not yet evident. This means that although the beginning and end are not yet evident, they are based on it. Therefore, it can be discussed by comparison to discuss above and below. Moreover, all the comparisons are one-sided. Therefore, one must further seek its beginning and end.

The light represents enlightened wisdom. The light illuminates this and that, first representing the two kinds of enlightenment, and next representing the three kinds of sameness.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0197b27_17']	於三同中二：	於三同中二：	In the three kinds of sameness, there are two:

Although this is so, even if one sees the prediction given to the small [vehicles] and the long lifespan, this assembly still has doubts, not knowing whether the śrāvakas of this land are included in the prediction or not?

Although the appearance of erecting stupas represents the two sūtras, the appearance of the Lotus Sūtra is still not clear, therefore it only forms the two similarities of the past and future, and the three similarities of this land are still not established.
['ZH_T34_1719_03a:0197c14_10']	言「二土出世意同」者，同五濁故故施等不殊，開權即是《法華》之相，息化即是《涅槃》之徵。	言「二土出世意同」者，同五濁故故施等不殊，開權即是《法華》之相，息化即是《涅槃》之徵。	As for the intention of appearing in the two lands is the same, it is the same because of the five turbidities, therefore the giving and so forth are not different. Opening the provisional is precisely the appearance of the Lotus Sūtra, and ceasing the transformation is precisely the sign of the Nirvana Sūtra.

It is only within the One that sudden and gradual arise. Therefore, it is now said to be not sudden but sudden.

Therefore, it says after the Tripiṭaka, because the Prajñāpāramitā section is the practice of bodhisattvas.

Causes and conditions refer to the distinctions in stimulus and response. Faith and understanding refer to the differences in the ability to stimulate. Characteristics refer to the differences in practice after faith. Although there are these differences, they are all called various. Although they take different paths, they do not go beyond the two flavors. Stimulus and response have each other's closeness and distance, so it is called causes and conditions.

Although there are various kinds, they all reach the Lotus Sutra without any other characteristics. However, since they have not yet seen the Lotus Sutra assembly, it is indicated by entering nirvana, so it is only said that there is one cause and one condition, etc.
