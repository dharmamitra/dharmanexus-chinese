['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b05_0']	敘數論等我中云汝所執我等。敘宗立量	敘數論等我中云汝所執我等。敘宗立量	02a	In the section on the number of theories, it says you claim that the self, etc. that you grasp exist. It summarizes the school's tenets and establishes the logical argument.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b06_0']	及出彼過如疏．樞要。然樞要中與第一量	及出彼過如疏．樞要。然樞要中與第一量	02a	And points out their errors as in the commentary and the Essentials of the Three Points. However, in the Essentials of the Three Points, it makes the first logical argument
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b07_9', 'ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b08_5']	作有法差別相違因過。🔽失解亦有有法自相相違因過。	作有法差別相違因過。 失解亦有有法自相相違因過。	02a	a logical error of contradicting the distinguishing characteristic of the subject.🔽There is also a logical error of contradicting the intrinsic nature of the subject.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b08_14']	執我有法正所諍故。	執我有法正所諍故。	02a	Because the subject of the thesis, the self, is the object of dispute.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b09_4']	虛空非我故　量云。	虛空非我故　量云。	02a	Because space is not the self. The logical argument is as follows:
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b09_9']	汝所執我。	汝所執我。	02a	The self that you grasp
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b09_14']	應非是我。	應非是我。	02a	Should not be the self.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b10_1']	許無初後故。	許無初後故。	02a	Because it is accepted as having no beginning or end.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b10_7']	如空　又解。	如空　又解。	02a	Like space. Another interpretation is:
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b10_16']	雖對敵立諍我有無。	雖對敵立諍我有無。	02a	Although the opponent establishes the dispute over whether the self exists or not,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b11_3']	猶無同喻。	猶無同喻。	02a	There is still no similar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b11_13']	故方便顯我常．遍等。	故方便顯我常．遍等。	02a	Therefore, it is expediently shown that the self is permanent, omnipresent, etc.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b12_4']	若許常．遍即離識有。	若許常．遍即離識有。	02a	If permanence and omnipresence are accepted, then it exists apart from consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b12_17']	准此即有有法自相相違之過。	准此即有有法自相相違之過。	02a	According to this, there is then the error of contradicting the intrinsic nature of the subject.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b13_12']	餘皆准思　第三量中樞要云。	餘皆准思　第三量中樞要云。	02a	The rest should be understood by analogy. In the third logical argument, the Essentials of the Three Points says:
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b14_3']	隨身之因隨一不成。	隨身之因隨一不成。	02a	The reason that follows the body is inconclusive.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b14_16']	於同喻空上不有即不共不定。	於同喻空上不有即不共不定。	02a	If it does not exist in the similar example of space, it is a special kind of indefinite reason.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b15_7']	常．遍之宗空為同喻。	常．遍之宗空為同喻。	02a	The thesis of permanence and ubiquity has space as the similar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b15_12']	瓶為異喻。	瓶為異喻。	02a	A pot is the dissimilar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b16_1']	隨身造業等因。	隨身造業等因。	02a	The reason because it creates karma according to the body🔽is not present in either the similar or dissimilar examples.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b16_14']	於同異喻二俱非有　要集云。	於同異喻二俱非有　要集云。	02a	The Yijang ũi says:
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b17_5']	此不共不定其相難解。	此不共不定其相難解。	02a	The characteristics of this special kind of indefinite reason are difficult to understand.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b17_15']	共許虛空體遍．常故。	共許虛空體遍．常故。	02a	Because space is commonly accepted as having a pervasive and permanent substance,🔽it cannot be criticized as being a dissimilar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b18_13']	不可難令以為異喻　彼由不識草瓶字。	不可難令以為異喻　彼由不識草瓶字。	02a	They mistakenly take the character grass in the word pot
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b19_2', 'ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b19_15']	謂是草難字。🔽即謂樞要難彼虛空還為異喻。	謂是草難字。 即謂樞要難彼虛空還為異喻。	02a	to be the character criticize.🔽They then criticize the pivot of the argument, saying that space is still a dissimilar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b20_10']	即難樞要云不可將空為同喻。	即難樞要云不可將空為同喻。	02a	They criticize the pivot of the argument, saying that space cannot be used as a similar example,🔽and again criticize it as being a dissimilar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b21_6']	復難為異喻　又二喻不並。	復難為異喻　又二喻不並。	02a	Moreover, the two examples are not parallel.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b21_14']	如何說言二俱無。	如何說言二俱無。	02a	How can it be said that both are absent?
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b22_8']	故應云此是喻中能立不成。	故應云此是喻中能立不成。	02a	Therefore, it should be said that this is a case where the proof in the example is not established.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b23_1']	以此為定　此不曾思。	以此為定　此不曾思。	02a	This is taken as a definitive conclusion. This has never been considered.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b23_13']	不知字錯故枉劬勞　又云。	不知字錯故枉劬勞　又云。	02a	Because they do not know that the character is mistaken, they waste their efforts. It also says:
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b23_16']	或可。	或可。	02a	Or perhaps.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b24_2']	虛空同喻。	虛空同喻。	02a	Space is the similar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b24_11']	餘色等法以為異喻。	餘色等法以為異喻。	02a	The remaining dharmas such as form are used as the dissimilar example.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b24_17']	隨身作受因。	隨身作受因。	02a	The reason is because it is the cause of the experience of the body.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b25_3']	異品有非有。	異品有非有。	02a	The dissimilar class is both existent and non-existent.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b25_13']	故成相違　今謂不爾。	故成相違　今謂不爾。	02a	Therefore, it becomes contradictory. The present [author] says this is not so.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b25_18']	若望數論。	若望數論。	02a	If it is in reference to the Sāṃkhya,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b26_7']	應云隨處受苦樂。	應云隨處受苦樂。	02a	it should be said because it experiences suffering and pleasure according to the place,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b26_13']	不得言作業。	不得言作業。	02a	and it cannot be said because it creates karma.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b27_2']	他宗不許故。	他宗不許故。	02a	This is because the other school does not accept it.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b27_12']	除我已外餘非受苦樂。	除我已外餘非受苦樂。	02a	Except for the self, the rest do not experience suffering and pleasure.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b28_7']	若勝論師唯我造業及受苦樂。	若勝論師唯我造業及受苦樂。	02a	If the Vaiśeṣika say that only the self creates karma and experiences suffering and pleasure,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b28_12']	色等亦非。	色等亦非。	02a	and form and so forth are not,

['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681b29_15']	前樞要說有法差別。	前樞要說有法差別。	02a	The previous Essentials of the Eight Categories says that the distinction of the property-possessor
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681c01_1']	雖是一師。	雖是一師。	02a	is although it is one teacher,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681c01_10']	若依別師所說稍異。	若依別師所說稍異。	02a	if it is based on the slightly different explanations of other teachers,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681c02_2']	謂若法．有法言顯宗者。	謂若法．有法言顯宗者。	02a	it is said that if the words property and property-possessor indicate the thesis,

['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681c12_17']	若亦取非有有緣性為差別。	若亦取非有有緣性為差別。	02a	If the non-production of a condition is also taken as the distinction,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681c13_10']	非有有緣性不唯有法上。	非有有緣性不唯有法上。	02a	The non-production of a condition is not only on the subject.

['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0681c29_13']	必有俱生增上別依。	必有俱生增上別依。	02a	Must have a simultaneously arisen dominant and separate support.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a01_3']	極成六識隨一攝故。	極成六識隨一攝故。	02a	Because it is included in one of the most commonly accepted six consciousnesses.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a01_8']	猶如五識。	猶如五識。	02a	Just like the five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a01_17']	此因是法差別相違。	此因是法差別相違。	02a	This reason contradicts the distinguishing characteristics of dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a02_2']	相違量云。	相違量云。	02a	The contradictory inference is:

['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a02_17']	不用第七為俱有別依。	不用第七為俱有別依。	02a	Does not take the seventh as its simultaneous and separate support.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a03_7']	極成六識隨一攝故。	極成六識隨一攝故。	02a	because they are included in one of the first six consciousnesses,

['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a04_1']	不以第七為別依。	不以第七為別依。	02a	The sixth consciousness does not take the seventh as its special support,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a04_6']	通第八故。	通第八故。	02a	because it is common to the eighth consciousness.🔽This is a distinction of dharmas.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a05_2']	是法差別　若准因明為他用難。	是法差別　若准因明為他用難。	02a	If, following the rules of Buddhist logic, you object that the reason is not established,
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a05_7']	此亦不成。	此亦不成。	02a	this is also not correct.
['ZH_T43_1832_02a:0682a06_2']	應云以非第七識為俱有別依。	應云以非第七識為俱有別依。	02a	You should say that the reason is not established because the sixth consciousness does not take the seventh as its special simultaneous support,
