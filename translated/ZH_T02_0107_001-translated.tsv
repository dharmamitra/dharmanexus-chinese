Having a dissipated mind, one will then experience suffering. Having experienced suffering, one will not attain concentration. Having not attained concentration, one will not know the truth. Having not known the truth, one will not see things as they are. Having not known and not seen things as they are, one will not abandon bonds and will not transcend doubts. Having not abandoned bonds and not transcended doubts, one will then be subject to other conditions, knowing differently and having different knowledge, one will then suffer and be uneasy.

Having a non-agitated mind, one experiences pleasure. Having experienced pleasure, one attains concentration. Having attained concentration, one realizes the truth as it is, with knowledge and insight. Having realized the truth as it is, with knowledge and insight, one abandons afflictions and transcends doubts. One then becomes free from lack of faith and lack of sincerity. One attains wisdom and mental peace and comfort. The same is said for the other six faculties. This is called guarding oneself.
