The past cause has ceased, so it also cannot be found. The future has not yet arrived, so it also cannot be found.
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007a22_6']	如是橫豎求身畢竟不可得，即是無，此無亦不可得，亦有亦無亦不可得，非有非無亦不可得，但有名字名之為身。	如是橫豎求身畢竟不可得，即是無，此無亦不可得，亦有亦無亦不可得，非有非無亦不可得，但有名字名之為身。	002	Thus, seeking the body horizontally and vertically, it is ultimately unobtainable, which is non-existence.

['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007a24_1']	不在中間，非色心合故。	不在中間，非色心合故。	002	It is not in between, because it is not a combination of form and mind.
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007a24_13']	亦不常自有，非離色心故。	亦不常自有，非離色心故。	002	It also does not always exist by itself, because it is not separate from form and mind.
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007a25_19']	當知名無召物之功、物無應名之實，假實既空，名物安在？	當知名無召物之功、物無應名之實，假實既空，名物安在？	002	It should be known that the name has no function of summoning objects, and objects have no reality of responding to the name. Since the provisional and the real are both empty, where can the name and object be?
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007a26_14']	如此觀身是觀實相，實相即是金。	如此觀身是觀實相，實相即是金。	002	Contemplating the body in this way is contemplating the true aspect, and the true aspect is gold.

['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007b02_3']	次觀煩惱道者，煩惱與業皆是身因，今且取煩惱為身因而起觀也。	次觀煩惱道者，煩惱與業皆是身因，今且取煩惱為身因而起觀也。	002	Next, contemplating the path of afflictions, afflictions and karma are all causes of the body. Now, taking afflictions as the cause of the body and giving rise to contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007b03_6']	《淨名》云「不壞身因而隨一相」者，應作四句分別：	《淨名》云「不壞身因而隨一相」者，應作四句分別：	002	The Vimalakirti Sutra says not destroying the cause of the body and following the single characteristic, one should make four statements to distinguish:

Not receiving a later body is called destroying the effect of the body.
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007b10_8']	凡俗之流，名衣好食長養五陰，縱心適性放逸貪恚癡，自惱惱他。	凡俗之流，名衣好食長養五陰，縱心適性放逸貪恚癡，自惱惱他。	002	The vulgar crowd, with fine clothes and good food, nurtures the five aggregates, indulging the mind, adapting to nature, and indulging in greed, anger, and delusion, harming oneself and others.
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007b11_15']	一身死壞復受一身，因果相續無有邊際，是名因果俱不壞。	一身死壞復受一身，因果相續無有邊際，是名因果俱不壞。	002	When one body perishes, one receives another body. Cause and effect continue on without end. This is called cause and effect both being indestructible.
['ZH_T39_1783_002:0007b13_10']	如犯王憲付旃陀羅，如怨對者自害其體，身既爛壞四陰亦盡，是為壞果。	如犯王憲付旃陀羅，如怨對者自害其體，身既爛壞四陰亦盡，是為壞果。	002	Like violating the king's laws and being handed over to the executioner, like an enemy harming one's own body. When the body is already rotten and the four aggregates are also exhausted, this is called destroying the effect.
