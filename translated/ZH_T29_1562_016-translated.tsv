['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422a28_12']	故知色法無同類因。	故知色法無同類因。	Therefore, we know that form dharmas have no similar causes.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b10_18']	部謂五部，謂見苦所斷乃至修所斷。	部謂五部，謂見苦所斷乃至修所斷。	Category refers to the five categories, namely those abandoned by seeing suffering up to those abandoned by cultivation.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b13_17']	此中欲界見苦所斷還與欲界見苦所斷為同類因，如是乃至欲界修所斷還與欲界修所斷為因。	此中欲界見苦所斷還與欲界見苦所斷為同類因，如是乃至欲界修所斷還與欲界修所斷為因。	Here, those abandoned by seeing suffering in the desire realm are homogeneous causes for those abandoned by seeing suffering in the desire realm. In this way, up to those abandoned by cultivation in the desire realm are causes for those abandoned by cultivation in the desire realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b15_7']	如說欲界五部所斷，靜慮無色各四地中，隨其所應皆如是說。	如說欲界五部所斷，靜慮無色各四地中，隨其所應皆如是說。	As it is said for the five categories abandoned in the desire realm, so it is said for the four stages in the dhyanas and formless [realms] as appropriate.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b18_15']	唯說前生與後生果為同類因，於義便闕，不說與未生為同類因故。	唯說前生與後生果為同類因，於義便闕，不說與未生為同類因故。	If one only says that the prior one is a homogeneous cause for the subsequent one that has arisen, there is a deficiency in the meaning, because it does not say that it is a homogeneous cause for that which has not yet arisen.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b20_6']	唯說過去與未來現在為同類因等，於義亦闕，不說過去有因果故。	唯說過去與未來現在為同類因等，於義亦闕，不說過去有因果故。	If one only says that the past is a homogeneous cause for the future and present, there is also a deficiency in the meaning, because it does not say that the past has a cause and effect.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b22_4']	若如前說，通攝本論所說前生與後生法，及說過去為現未因，現在但為未來因義。	若如前說，通攝本論所說前生與後生法，及說過去為現未因，現在但為未來因義。	If, as stated above, one generally includes the prior one that is explained in the treatise as a homogeneous cause for the subsequent dharma that has arisen, and explains that the past is a cause for the present and future, and the present is only a cause for the future,
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b22_13']	未來何故無同類因？	未來何故無同類因？	why does the future not have a homogeneous cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b23_3']	彼無前後次第義故。	彼無前後次第義故。	Because it lacks the meaning of prior and subsequent sequence.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b25_18']	又異熟因於未來世亦應非有，由異熟果望異熟因無前後故。	又異熟因於未來世亦應非有，由異熟果望異熟因無前後故。	Also, the cause of retribution would not exist in the future, because the effect of retribution is not prior to or simultaneous with the cause of retribution.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b27_8']	要依前後立同類因，非正生時，已越後位未有作用，如餘未來。	要依前後立同類因，非正生時，已越後位未有作用，如餘未來。	The similar cause is established on the basis of priority and posteriority, but when a dharma is in the process of being born, it has already passed through the future and has not yet had the activity of a present dharma. It is like other future dharmas.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b28_7']	過去唯前、未來唯後、現通前後，約世定故。	過去唯前、未來唯後、現通前後，約世定故。	Past dharmas are only prior, future dharmas are only posterior, and present dharmas are both prior and posterior, because they are definitely established in terms of time.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422b29_5']	過去諸法雖皆是前，而取果時已定前後。	過去諸法雖皆是前，而取果時已定前後。	Although all past dharmas are prior, when they take an effect, they are already definitely prior or posterior.

It must reach the present and the stage of having been born in order to exclude future dharmas and make them into a posterior stage. It takes as its effect that which it has already taken as its activity.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c05_15']	既互為因應互為果，互為因果與理相違。	既互為因應互為果，互為因果與理相違。	If they are causes for each other, they should be results for each other, and it is unreasonable for cause and result to be mutually interchangeable.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c07_15']	既無理能遮互為果，則應許有果在因先，亦有二心互為因義，是則違害《發智論》文。	既無理能遮互為果，則應許有果在因先，亦有二心互為因義，是則違害《發智論》文。	If there is no principle that can prevent them from being results for each other, then we must admit that results can precede their causes, and that there can be a relationship of mutual causality between two minds. This would contradict the text of the Abhidharmapāda.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c08_12']	彼異熟因與果相別，雖離前後而無上過。	彼異熟因與果相別，雖離前後而無上過。	The cause of retribution and its result are separate, even though they are not separated by past and future. There is no error in this.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c09_7']	故同類因，就位建立，未來非有；	故同類因，就位建立，未來非有；	Therefore, the similar cause is established on the basis of state, and does not exist in the future.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c10_1']	若異熟因，就相建立，未來非無。	若異熟因，就相建立，未來非無。	If the cause of retribution is established on the basis of characteristics, it does not not exist in the future.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c12_19']	許故無失，約位非體，由和合作用位果非體果，和合作用是法差別因緣和合，法行異位。	許故無失，約位非體，由和合作用位果非體果，和合作用是法差別因緣和合，法行異位。	We admit this, but there is no error. It is based on state, not on essence. The result of state is not the result of essence, because the combination of causes and conditions and the function of causes and conditions are the causes of the differences in dharmas. The function of dharmas is different in different states.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c14_7']	法行異位非離體成，然異位行亦非即體，如是異位從異位生。	法行異位非離體成，然異位行亦非即體，如是異位從異位生。	The function of dharmas in different states is not accomplished apart from essence. However, the function in different states is also not identical to essence. In this way, different states arise from different states.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c15_8']	同類果因名為異位，故和合作用位果非體果。	同類果因名為異位，故和合作用位果非體果。	The effect of the same category is called “different states,” and therefore the state of the combination of causes and effects is the effect of state, not the effect of essence.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c16_3']	理雖無過，文而有違，如本論說：	理雖無過，文而有違，如本論說：	Although this principle is without error, the text is in contradiction. As the Abhidharmasamuccaya says:
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c16_19']	若法與彼法為因，無時此法非彼因。	若法與彼法為因，無時此法非彼因。	“If a dharma is a cause for another dharma, there is no time when this dharma is not a cause for that dharma.”
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c17_18']	豈不過現與彼為因、未來非因，便違此說。	豈不過現與彼為因、未來非因，便違此說。	How can it be that the present is a cause for that dharma, but the future is not a cause?
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c19_2']	無違此過，此依俱有、相應、異熟通三世因，密意說故。	無違此過，此依俱有、相應、異熟通三世因，密意說故。	There is no error in contradicting this, because this is said with an implied meaning, namely, that the causes of the three time periods of coexistent, associated, and retributive causes are causes.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c21_17']	未來雖無，而此意說能為因後無時非因。	未來雖無，而此意說能為因後無時非因。	Although they do not exist in the future, this means that they are able to be causes in the future, and there is no time when they are not causes.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c23_7']	又此未來亦定應有，謂有為法於正生時定能為因，殄諸障故。	又此未來亦定應有，謂有為法於正生時定能為因，殄諸障故。	Moreover, these future must definitely exist, because dharmas in the present moment of arising are definitely able to be causes, because they eliminate obstacles.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c23_16']	依此密說無時非因。	依此密說無時非因。	This is the implied meaning of the statement that there is no time when they are not causes.

['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c25_4']	彼非善釋，以未來法正生位前非同類因，後方成故。	彼非善釋，以未來法正生位前非同類因，後方成故。	This is not a good explanation, because future dharmas are not homogeneous causes before the stage of arising, but only become so later.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c26_3']	如是過難，前已釋通，謂非未來有前後故。	如是過難，前已釋通，謂非未來有前後故。	This fault has already been explained, namely, because the future does not have a sequence of earlier and later.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c27_2']	就三世說無時非因，意顯更無第四時故。	就三世說無時非因，意顯更無第四時故。	It is said that there is no time when it is not a cause in terms of the three time periods, in order to show that there is no fourth time.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c27_13']	若爾，等無間應同此說。	若爾，等無間應同此說。	If that is so, the similar and immediately antecedent condition should be explained in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1562_016:0422c28_3']	然本論不許，故本論言：	然本論不許，故本論言：	However, the Abhidharma does not allow this, and therefore the Abhidharma says:
