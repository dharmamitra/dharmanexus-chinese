By obtaining these ten meanings to resolve the various differences, one can be at ease without error. Therefore, it first praises the wisdom that can rely on, which is the expedient and real of the five Buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222a25_11']	權實何依？	權實何依？	04b	What does expedient and real rely on?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222a25_16']	所謂妙境。	所謂妙境。	04b	It is called the wondrous realm.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222a27_14']	境不稱智尚非佛智，況無境可論直云對等，何能曉此難思妙智，是以廣破諸師。	境不稱智尚非佛智，況無境可論直云對等，何能曉此難思妙智，是以廣破諸師。	04b	If the realm does not match the wisdom, it is still not the wisdom of the Buddha, let alone having no realm to discuss and simply say it corresponds, how can one understand this difficult to conceive wondrous wisdom? Therefore, it extensively refutes the various masters.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b01_12', 'ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b01_17']	次廣建立，《玄》及《止觀》以此為主，一家用義大括包富者莫不由此，恐後輩猶亡其所歸，故慇懃煩重，親見尋斯教者猶昧故耳。🔽故須思之！	次廣建立，《玄》及《止觀》以此為主，一家用義大括包富者莫不由此，恐後輩猶亡其所歸，故慇懃煩重，親見尋斯教者猶昧故耳。 故須思之！	04b	Next, the extensive establishment is based on the Profound and the Cessation and Contemplation. The most inclusive and rich meaning used by the one school is all due to this. Fearing that later generations will still lose their return, it is therefore earnest and repetitive. Those who personally see and seek this teaching are still confused.🔽Therefore, it is necessary to contemplate it!
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b02_3']	故須思之！	故須思之！	04b	Therefore, it is necessary to contemplate it!
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b03_9']	若迷此意，諸教之蹊徑任運失趣，一化之條流於茲枯竭。	若迷此意，諸教之蹊徑任運失趣，一化之條流於茲枯竭。	04b	If one is confused about this meaning, the paths of all teachings will naturally lose their direction, and the branches and streams of the one teaching will dry up here.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b05_1']	光宅云「三三」者，謂人教因，昔無果義故，三乘各三、一理非虛故。	光宅云「三三」者，謂人教因，昔無果義故，三乘各三、一理非虛故。	04b	Guangzhai says three threes means that people, teachings, and causes lacked the meaning of fruition in the past, so each of the three vehicles has three, and the one principle is not empty.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b06_4']	言「實相」者，應云非虛故實、非相為相，故名實相。	言「實相」者，應云非虛故實、非相為相，故名實相。	04b	As for real appearance, it should be said that because it is not empty, it is real, and because it is not appearance, it is called the real appearance.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b08_16']	「四一之中偏舉理」者，準光宅意，既同舊人，不立理一，但云理是四一之本，故四俱名一，此不及今文云四中之一。	「四一之中偏舉理」者，準光宅意，既同舊人，不立理一，但云理是四一之本，故四俱名一，此不及今文云四中之一。	04b	As for among the four ones, it is biased to bring up principle, according to Guangzhai's meaning, since it is the same as the old people, it does not establish the oneness of principle, but only says that principle is the basis of the four ones, so the four are all called one. This is not as good as the present text saying one among the four.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b09_12']	此去訖「北師」並是光宅釋也。	此去訖「北師」並是光宅釋也。	04b	From here to Northern Teacher are all Guangzhai's explanations.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b11_11']	「菩薩以六度為體」者，光宅亦立三祇菩薩，以為三乘之中菩薩，即今文三藏菩薩也。	「菩薩以六度為體」者，光宅亦立三祇菩薩，以為三乘之中菩薩，即今文三藏菩薩也。	04b	As for bodhisattvas take the six pāramitās as their essence, Guangzhai also establishes the bodhisattvas of three asaṃkhyeya kalpas as the bodhisattvas among the three vehicles, which are the bodhisattvas of the Tripiṭaka in the present text.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b14_2']	近代以來此義全棄，五百所集須歸五天，若但會退，大自歸佛、道不關此者，何但定性永滅，亦乃菩薩空談。	近代以來此義全棄，五百所集須歸五天，若但會退，大自歸佛、道不關此者，何但定性永滅，亦乃菩薩空談。	04b	In recent times, this meaning has been completely abandoned. The five hundred collected must return to the five heavens. If it is only said that the great one retreats and returns to the Buddha, and the path has nothing to do with this, not only will the determined nature be eternally extinguished, but the bodhisattvas will also be empty talk.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b14_20']	「云云」者，應明支佛聲聞以諦緣為體。	「云云」者，應明支佛聲聞以諦緣為體。	04b	As for and so on, it should clarify that pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas take the four noble truths and conditioned arising as their essence.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b16_13']	「實境有四一，以四廣其一理」者，因緣等四判為實境，故以此等廣談理一。	「實境有四一，以四廣其一理」者，因緣等四判為實境，故以此等廣談理一。	04b	The real realm has four, using the four to expand the one principle means that the four such as causes and conditions are judged to be the real realm, so these are used to extensively discuss the one principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b19_8']	暢師但約佛上唯立一實而無三權，對十力者非無此理，望今四釋佛乘，一釋尚自未周，以無究竟空假中等故也。	暢師但約佛上唯立一實而無三權，對十力者非無此理，望今四釋佛乘，一釋尚自未周，以無究竟空假中等故也。	04b	The teacher Chang only establishes one reality on the Buddha's side and no three provisional [vehicles]. Facing the ten powers, this principle is not non-existent, but in terms of the present four explanations of the Buddha vehicle, even one explanation is still incomplete, because there is no ultimate emptiness, falsity, and so forth.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b22_1']	於中相是總舉十力之相，次是別對性等體為根本，最後云「總」者，約前八力釋處非處，即以本末總收前九。	於中相是總舉十力之相，次是別對性等體為根本，最後云「總」者，約前八力釋處非處，即以本末總收前九。	04b	Among them, the characteristics are the general indication of the characteristics of the ten powers. Next, the nature and so forth are specifically opposed as the fundamental substance. The last one says general because the eight powers are used to explain the proper and improper, and the fundamental and branches are generally included in the previous nine.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b23_17']	「上來諸釋非不一途」者，諸釋可見，望今家釋各得十界十如中之少分，故云一途。	「上來諸釋非不一途」者，諸釋可見，望今家釋各得十界十如中之少分，故云一途。	04b	The above explanations are not the only way means that the explanations can be seen. Compared to the explanations of this household, each obtains a small part among the ten realms and ten suchnesses, so it is said to be one way.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b25_4']	光宅雖似自得四聖而但立九，又分擗九五權四實；	光宅雖似自得四聖而但立九，又分擗九五權四實；	04b	Although Guangzhai seems to have attained the four sages by himself, he only establishes nine, and further divides the nine into five provisional and four real.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b26_8']	北瑤二師雖具立十而不分判，但在三乘又無一實。	北瑤二師雖具立十而不分判，但在三乘又無一實。	04b	Although the two masters of the Northern and Southern dynasties established ten [aspects], they did not divide them, and within the three vehicles there is also no one reality.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b28_4']	然攢眾釋既許三乘及以一乘，三一俱有性相等十，何為不語六道十耶？	然攢眾釋既許三乘及以一乘，三一俱有性相等十，何為不語六道十耶？	04b	However, since the collective interpretation allows for both the three vehicles and the one vehicle, both the three and the one have the ten such as nature and characteristics, why not speak of the ten in the six destinies?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222b29_13']	四聖是事從因至果，六道亦事亦應例然，因果既同十義寧闕？	四聖是事從因至果，六道亦事亦應例然，因果既同十義寧闕？	04b	The four holy ones are phenomena that go from cause to effect, and the six destinies are also phenomena, so they should be the same. Since cause and effect are the same, how can the ten meanings be lacking?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c02_10']	四聖是能照、六道是所照，十界是所照、佛乘是能照，故佛智照十界十如三諦具足。	四聖是能照、六道是所照，十界是所照、佛乘是能照，故佛智照十界十如三諦具足。	04b	The four holy ones are the illuminator, and the six destinies are the illuminated. The ten realms are the illuminated, and the Buddha vehicle is the illuminator. Therefore, the Buddha's wisdom illuminates the ten realms, the ten suchnesses, and the three truths are complete.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c04_1']	究竟等言其理宛爾，何故諸佛各據一途，使佛境智不具足耶？	究竟等言其理宛爾，何故諸佛各據一途，使佛境智不具足耶？	04b	The words ultimate and so on have their principle intact. Why do the various Buddhas each rely on one path, causing the realm and wisdom of the Buddhas to be incomplete?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c05_4']	今師不能細斥，但總破光宅，云「文理不通」等也。	今師不能細斥，但總破光宅，云「文理不通」等也。	04b	The present master is unable to refute in detail, but only generally refutes Guangzhai, saying the text and principle do not penetrate and so on.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c06_11']	「理」謂道理，「文」即現文，初文可見，次破理中先以十中四五對難。	「理」謂道理，「文」即現文，初文可見，次破理中先以十中四五對難。	04b	Principle refers to principles, text refers to the present text. The first text can be seen. Next, in refuting the principles, first using four and five of the ten to create difficulties.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c07_7']	「因果」者，因緣是因，果報是果。	「因果」者，因緣是因，果報是果。	04b	Cause and effect means causes and conditions are the cause, and karmic retribution is the effect.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c08_14']	「若實」下約人對破且依四五，若依今文應約十界以論有無。	「若實」下約人對破且依四五，若依今文應約十界以論有無。	04b	If it is real and below, discussing people to refute, for now relying on four and five. If according to the present text, it should discuss existence and non-existence based on the ten realms.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c09_3']	次「義不」下結破。	次「義不」下結破。	04b	Next, the meaning is not and below, concluding the refutation.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c11_8']	文云諸法須收十界，界界十如，實相是界如之體，若唯一但四，體外尚遺九五，況復十十皆如？	文云諸法須收十界，界界十如，實相是界如之體，若唯一但四，體外尚遺九五，況復十十皆如？	04b	The text says all dharmas must include the ten realms, with ten suchnesses in each realm. The true aspect is the essence of the realms and suchnesses. If there is only one, it is only four. Even the essence is still missing nine and five, let alone the ten tens are all suchnesses?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c12_4']	今欲正解，先引《大論》即達磨所用。	今欲正解，先引《大論》即達磨所用。	04b	Now wanting to correctly explain, first citing the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra is the method used by Nāgârjuna.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c13_1']	引《論》意者但泛為類例，非的同也。	引《論》意者但泛為類例，非的同也。	04b	The meaning of citing the śāstra is just a general example, not exactly the same.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c17_4']	《論》既云一一法各有九種，故知光宅不應以四五別判，諸師不應以三一各據，故知但依十界十法，則諸家咸壞，況復四釋冠絕古今，如此消文方契經旨，諸師分擗理趣在何？	《論》既云一一法各有九種，故知光宅不應以四五別判，諸師不應以三一各據，故知但依十界十法，則諸家咸壞，況復四釋冠絕古今，如此消文方契經旨，諸師分擗理趣在何？	04b	Since the treatise says that each dharma has nine kinds, we know that Guangzhai should not distinguish them with four or five, and the various masters should not each take them with three or one. Therefore, we know that they only rely on the ten realms and ten dharmas, then all the families are destroyed. Moreover, the four explanations surpass the past and present. If the text is explained like this, it will accord with the meaning of the sutra. In what principle do the various masters' divisions lie?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c18_20']	此達磨欝多羅是《雜心論》主，《婆沙》有法救論師，是《雜心論》主所承，從師為名。	此達磨欝多羅是《雜心論》主，《婆沙》有法救論師，是《雜心論》主所承，從師為名。	04b	This Dharmatrāta is the author of the Abhidharma-samuccaya-vyākhyā. In the *Mahāvibhāṣā, there is the master *Dharmatrāta, who is the successor of the author of the Abhidharma-samuccaya-vyākhyā. He is named after his teacher.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c20_19']	既依《大論》不別分張，今一一句中皆云即是《法華》中如是相等，縱不委細免上諸非。	既依《大論》不別分張，今一一句中皆云即是《法華》中如是相等，縱不委細免上諸非。	04b	Since he relies on the *Mahāvibhāṣā and does not divide them separately, now in each sentence he says that they are the same as the characteristics, etc. in the Lotus Sutra. Even if he does not go into detail, he avoids the above criticisms.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c22_2']	次「今明」下正解中，先述標章，次正釋中文為三意：	次「今明」下正解中，先述標章，次正釋中文為三意：	04b	Next, under Now Clarifying, in the correct explanation, he first discusses the chapter headings, and then correctly explains the text, which has three meanings:

['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c25_8']	引證文中初二文可見，次引離合中云「止止不須說」等者，以此十法隨自隨他，唯佛決了，故云「我法妙難思」。	引證文中初二文可見，次引離合中云「止止不須說」等者，以此十法隨自隨他，唯佛決了，故云「我法妙難思」。	04b	In the citation section, the first two texts are evident. Next, in the citation of combination and separation, it says Stop, stop, do not speak and so on. This is because these ten dharmas follow oneself and others, and only the Buddha can decide them, so it is said my Dharma is wonderfully difficult to conceive.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c26_11']	但引合文義兼於離，既云難思方能遍逗，故須離也。	但引合文義兼於離，既云難思方能遍逗，故須離也。	04b	But citing the combined text also implies separation. Since it is said to be difficult to conceive, it can only be used to guide everywhere, so separation is necessary.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c28_1']	引約位中云「唯佛與佛等」者，三德極理非七方便所知故也。	引約位中云「唯佛與佛等」者，三德極理非七方便所知故也。	04b	In the citation of the position, it says only the Buddha and the Buddha, etc. This is because the ultimate principle of the three virtues is not known by the seven expedient means.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c29_1']	雖復不知諸位法爾，故分此十所屬不同。	雖復不知諸位法爾，故分此十所屬不同。	04b	Although it is not known, the various positions are as they are, so this division of the ten is different.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0222c29_13']	三正釋者，初十界中為十：	三正釋者，初十界中為十：	04b	Third, in the correct explanation, there are ten in the first ten realms:
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a03_9']	先標列，次「法雖」下界如攝法，三「如地獄」下示相，四「故毘曇」下以小例大，五「當知」下以理準例知有界如，六「若照」下判。	先標列，次「法雖」下界如攝法，三「如地獄」下示相，四「故毘曇」下以小例大，五「當知」下以理準例知有界如，六「若照」下判。	04b	First, the enumeration is listed. Next, below although the Dharma, the realm is like the Dharma. Third, below like hell, the characteristics are shown. Fourth, below therefore, the Abhidharma, the small is used as an example of the great. Fifth, below one should know, the principle is used as a standard to know that there is a realm like. Sixth, below if illuminated, it is judged.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a10_8']	言「自位」者，雖明十界界界各十，且照當界以九為權、以一為實，故須結云一中無量，一界具十，一一十如，若自若他、若因若果在一心故，故云無量中一、一中無量，不可以一說、不可以多說，不可以權說、不可以實說，因果善惡空有大小、凡聖漸頓開合心法依正，一多自在，一切諸法悉皆如是。	言「自位」者，雖明十界界界各十，且照當界以九為權、以一為實，故須結云一中無量，一界具十，一一十如，若自若他、若因若果在一心故，故云無量中一、一中無量，不可以一說、不可以多說，不可以權說、不可以實說，因果善惡空有大小、凡聖漸頓開合心法依正，一多自在，一切諸法悉皆如是。	04b	As for in its own position, although it clarifies the ten realms, each realm having ten, it still illuminates the present realm, using the nine as provisional and the one as real. Therefore, it must be concluded that in the one there are innumerable, with each realm having ten, each ten being like this, whether in oneself or others, whether cause or effect, because they are in one mind. Therefore, it is said that in the innumerable there is one, and in the one there are innumerable. It cannot be said in one, it cannot be said in many, it cannot be said in provisional, and it cannot be said in real. Cause, effect, good, evil, emptiness, existence, large, small, ordinary, holy, gradual, sudden, opening and closing, mind, dharma, dependent origination, self, many, free and easy, all dharmas are all like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a11_12']	是知譚法界者未窮斯妙，致使惑果事而迷因理。	是知譚法界者未窮斯妙，致使惑果事而迷因理。	04b	Know that those who discuss the dharma realm have not yet reached this subtlety, causing them to be confused by the events of the effect and deluded about the principle of the cause.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a13_1']	七「若照六道」下兼破光宅，光宅既無十界，今且依彼破之。	七「若照六道」下兼破光宅，光宅既無十界，今且依彼破之。	04b	7. If one illuminates the six realms, etc., also refutes Guangzhai. Since Guangzhai has no ten realms, now I will rely on him to refute.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a14_1']	縱依十界各具十如，當分歷歷思議境耳。	縱依十界各具十如，當分歷歷思議境耳。	04b	Even if the ten realms each possess the ten suchnesses, they are only the objects of thought in the individual realms.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a14_14']	況復光宅但在四聖四五不同。	況復光宅但在四聖四五不同。	04b	Moreover, Guangzhai's interpretation is only about the four holy ones having different numbers of five [suchnesses].
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a15_15']	八「所以」下結位，先重立境云「一中無量」。	八「所以」下結位，先重立境云「一中無量」。	04b	The eighth section on therefore concludes the stages. First, it reiterates the realm, saying immeasurable in one.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a17_13']	「凡夫絕理」等者，自鄙無分故云「絕理」，隨想異見故云「情迷」，既絕且迷徒具何益？	「凡夫絕理」等者，自鄙無分故云「絕理」，隨想異見故云「情迷」，既絕且迷徒具何益？	04b	Ordinary beings are cut off from truth and so on. Because they despise themselves as having no share, it says cut off from truth. Because their thoughts and views differ, it says deluded emotions. Since they are both cut off and deluded, what benefit is there in merely possessing [the ten suchnesses]?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a19_2']	「二乘」等者，即二教二乘，三道即是捨而不觀，避空求空反資小脫。	「二乘」等者，即二教二乘，三道即是捨而不觀，避空求空反資小脫。	04b	The two vehicles refers to the two teachings of the two vehicles. The three paths are what they abandon and do not contemplate, avoiding emptiness and seeking emptiness, which in turn supports their minor liberation.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a21_11']	「菩薩」等者，藏通照六、別照次第，故云不周，皆迷己界不達佛界，不了了言尚該十地，故今應指別地及因。	「菩薩」等者，藏通照六、別照次第，故云不周，皆迷己界不達佛界，不了了言尚該十地，故今應指別地及因。	04b	Bodhisattvas refers to the six contemplations of the Tripiṭaka and Shared [Teachings], and the sequential contemplations of the Distinct [Teaching]. Therefore it says not comprehensive. They all are deluded about their own realm and do not reach the Buddha realm. The phrase not fully understanding still encompasses the ten grounds, so now it should refer to the distinct grounds and causes.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223a23_2']	「橫竪具足」者，一中無量為橫，無量即一為竪，多一相即故云具足。	「橫竪具足」者，一中無量為橫，無量即一為竪，多一相即故云具足。	04b	Horizontal and vertical completeness means that the immeasurable is in one, which is horizontal, and one is the immeasurable, which is vertical. Because many and one are mutually inclusive, it is called completeness.

Now, it is only fruition and does not extend to deluded causes. Therefore, each dharma uses both negations, neither characteristics nor provisional, neither non-characteristics nor emptiness. Although it comes from the double negation, the meaning lies in the three truths. The following nine can be understood in the same way, up to the ultimate end. Such is called the ultimate Buddha vehicle. Therefore, they are all concluded with the text of the great vehicle.

The words of a single verse or line are even more believable. The teachings of the three virtues and three tracks are as clear as before one's eyes.

In terms of this, it is said to attain one eye. Bodhisattvas from the first stage up to equal enlightenment still have ignorance.

The power is in the five ranks, and the action is in the six sense faculties. The causes and conditions are precisely the cultivation and attainment of conditions and knowledge above the initial abode, and the retribution is precisely the ultimate fruit of bodhi and nirvāṇa.

Therefore, the power and below belong to cultivation and to the fruits. The reason why the stage of contemplation and practice investigates this nature realm has the power to remove coarse delusions and the creation of similar practices.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223c08_3']	若入分真對彼性三合名為正，乃以具助名為因緣，至究竟位，菩提名果、涅槃名報。	若入分真對彼性三合名為正，乃以具助名為因緣，至究竟位，菩提名果、涅槃名報。	04b	If one enters the true and opposes those three natures, it is collectively called the correct. Then, the complete assistance is called the causes and conditions. At the ultimate stage, enlightenment is called the fruit and nirvana is called the retribution.

['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0223c24_2']	若望止觀互用寬狹，今具四釋則此寬彼狹，此但正報不語三千則此狹彼寬，名目雖然理必齊等，因必具果、正必有依。	若望止觀互用寬狹，今具四釋則此寬彼狹，此但正報不語三千則此狹彼寬，名目雖然理必齊等，因必具果、正必有依。	04b	If compared to the mutual use of breadth and narrowness in the Calming and Contemplation, now with the four explanations this is broad and the other is narrow. This only discusses the correct retribution and does not speak of the three thousand, so this is narrow and the other is broad. Although the names are like this, the principle must be equal, the cause must include the effect, and the correct must have a basis.

['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a10_5']	次異中云「開合」者，上長行中人法俱開，故諸佛中並二智各明歎釋結故云「開」，今但云世雄故云「合」。	次異中云「開合」者，上長行中人法俱開，故諸佛中並二智各明歎釋結故云「開」，今但云世雄故云「合」。	04b	As for the second difference, saying opening and closing, in the above prose, both the person and the Dharma are opened, so in all buddhas, both knowledges are clearly praised, explained, and concluded, thus called opening. Now it only says hero of the world, thus called closing.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a10_17']	人必兼法故云「人總」也。	人必兼法故云「人總」也。	04b	Since the person must also include the Dharma, it is said to be general in the person.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a12_6']	言「法別」者，被物時異故有權實，此別仍合無歎等三，故第三異。	言「法別」者，被物時異故有權實，此別仍合無歎等三，故第三異。	04b	As for specific in the Dharma, it is because the Dharma is manifested at different times, there is provisional and actual. This specificity is still combined without the three such as praise, therefore the third is different.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a14_7']	云「二乘」及「一切眾生」者，同是不知之人尚未足異，應云上人法並舉，故云其智慧門法也。	云「二乘」及「一切眾生」者，同是不知之人尚未足異，應云上人法並舉，故云其智慧門法也。	04b	Saying two vehicles and all sentient beings are the same in being those who do not know, and are not yet different enough. It should be said that the superior person and Dharma are both mentioned, therefore it is said that the Dharma is the gate of wisdom.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a14_18']	「一切聲聞」等，人也。	「一切聲聞」等，人也。	04b	All śrāvakas and so on are the person.

['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a19_1']	又上文不分四佛但云「諸佛」，故今前行但云「世雄」即當諸佛，後行但云「佛力」不云「吾今」，以前文中釋迦權智具有力無畏等，知是頌釋迦也。	又上文不分四佛但云「諸佛」，故今前行但云「世雄」即當諸佛，後行但云「佛力」不云「吾今」，以前文中釋迦權智具有力無畏等，知是頌釋迦也。	04b	Moreover, the previous text does not distinguish the four buddhas but only says all buddhas, therefore the previous practice only says heroic among the world which corresponds to all buddhas, and the later practice only says Buddha's power and does not say I now, because in the previous text Śākyamuni's provisional wisdom fully possesses power, fearlessness, and so on, it is known to be a praise of Śākyamuni.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a22_15']	又前文有「諸佛」字，則可分為四佛，今但云「世雄」似非諸佛，然以義分，以「世雄」句有「世」字故可屬三世，世必有方故知是頌諸佛，後行直云「佛」灼然可屬釋迦。	又前文有「諸佛」字，則可分為四佛，今但云「世雄」似非諸佛，然以義分，以「世雄」句有「世」字故可屬三世，世必有方故知是頌諸佛，後行直云「佛」灼然可屬釋迦。	04b	Moreover, the previous text has the word buddhas, so it can be divided into four buddhas. Now it only says hero of the world, which does not seem to be the buddhas. However, from the meaning, since the phrase hero of the world has the word world, it can be attributed to the three worlds. Since there must be a direction in the world, it is known to be a praise of the buddhas. The following line simply says buddha, which is clearly attributable to Śākyamuni.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a24_11']	言「佛力無畏是權智」者，前長行中指於因權，此中既云功德，功德之言亦多在因。	言「佛力無畏是權智」者，前長行中指於因權，此中既云功德，功德之言亦多在因。	04b	As for saying the Buddha's powers and fearlessnesses are expedient wisdom, the previous prose section points to the expedient causes. Since it is said here that the merits are also mostly in the causes.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a27_4']	「餘法」等者，前力無畏但是自行從因之權，是故餘法為化他權，此之化他非指權法名為化他，但對自因名化他耳。	「餘法」等者，前力無畏但是自行從因之權，是故餘法為化他權，此之化他非指權法名為化他，但對自因名化他耳。	04b	As for the other dharmas and so forth, the previous powers and fearlessnesses are only the expedient from the causes for one's own benefit. Therefore, the other dharmas are the expedient for benefiting others. This benefiting others does not point to the expedient dharmas and call them benefiting others. It is only in contrast to one's own causes that it is called benefiting others.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225a28_20']	「但舉初後」者，仍先舉後二却舉初二，故先云「大果報」，次云「性相義」也。	「但舉初後」者，仍先舉後二却舉初二，故先云「大果報」，次云「性相義」也。	04b	Only mentioning the first and last means first mentioning the last two and then mentioning the first two. Therefore, it first says great fruition and then says nature and characteristics.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225b01_4']	「義字」等者，「義」謂義理，秖一究竟之言，有空假中義理故也。	「義字」等者，「義」謂義理，秖一究竟之言，有空假中義理故也。	04b	The character yi and so on. Yi means meaning and principle. It is only the word ultimate that has the meanings of emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225b04_1']	「大與種種」等者，具如《玄》文破光宅中，彼云「大故知是實，種種故知是實」，今文意云，權實互有，豈果報唯大、性相唯種種耶？	「大與種種」等者，具如《玄》文破光宅中，彼云「大故知是實，種種故知是實」，今文意云，權實互有，豈果報唯大、性相唯種種耶？	04b	Great and various and so on. It is as explained in the Discourse on the Profound Meaning in the section on refuting Guangzhai. It says because it is great, it is known to be real. Because it is various, it is known to be real. The meaning of this text is saying, since the provisional and the real have each other, how can the fruition only be great and the nature and characteristics only be various?
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225b04_14']	又釋妙中大妙相望以為六句。	又釋妙中大妙相望以為六句。	04b	Moreover, in explaining the wonderful, the great and the wonderful are compared to form six statements.

['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225b08_14']	云「生出四種解釋，已如上」者，指上四番釋十如也。	云「生出四種解釋，已如上」者，指上四番釋十如也。	04b	The four kinds of explanations arise, as already mentioned above refers to the above four explanations of the ten suchnesses.

['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0225b10_18']	「逮」者及也。	「逮」者及也。	04b	Attaining means reaching.

If it is in the three and a half verses, it means that this brief opening moves their old attachments and causes new doubts to arise. Therefore, the prose text is also called raising doubts and making requests. Since the attachments are moved, doubts arise. Now, doubts are first raised and then requests are made. Therefore, this text is used in both directions and is not confused.

Because the previous gives rise to doubts, so doubts arise. Since doubts have arisen, now only requests are made. Therefore, the beginning of the chapter only says raising doubts and making requests.

['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0228a04_17']	古師意者，元是菩薩，初周聞法得成法身，至〈壽量〉中增道損生。	古師意者，元是菩薩，初周聞法得成法身，至〈壽量〉中增道損生。	04b	The intention of the ancient masters is that they were originally bodhisattvas. In the first chapter, they heard the Dharma and attained the Dharma body. In the chapter on life-span, they increased the path and reduced birth.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0228a06_14']	今云聲聞至後雖通是菩薩，或有未得無生忍者，不名增道，故但云「無生」。	今云聲聞至後雖通是菩薩，或有未得無生忍者，不名增道，故但云「無生」。	04b	Now it is said that although the śrāvakas reach the end and are all bodhisattvas, some have not yet attained the forbearance of non-arising, and are not called increasing the path, so it is only said non-arising.
['ZH_T34_1719_04b:0228a09_10']	今師前難古人者，本是菩薩尚有至彼方得無生，如初釋惟忖中，先得十住等自是一途，豈令菩薩盡先於法說得無生耶？	今師前難古人者，本是菩薩尚有至彼方得無生，如初釋惟忖中，先得十住等自是一途，豈令菩薩盡先於法說得無生耶？	04b	The present master's previous criticism of the ancients is that they were originally bodhisattvas, but still had to reach there to attain non-arising. As in the initial explanation of the contemplation, first attaining the ten abodes and so forth is one approach. How can it be required that all bodhisattvas first attain non-arising in the Dharma teaching?
