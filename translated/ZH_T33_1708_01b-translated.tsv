['ZH_T33_1708_01b:0385b03_16']	所以者何？	所以者何？	01b	Why is this?
['ZH_T33_1708_01b:0385b04_5']	前七地中自有二義：	前七地中自有二義：	01b	The first seven grounds have two meanings:
['ZH_T33_1708_01b:0385b05_7']	一受分段生，故《智度論》云「七地菩薩受虫身肉身。	一受分段生，故《智度論》云「七地菩薩受虫身肉身。	01b	One is to experience the compounded birth, thus the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, The bodhisattva of the seventh ground experiences the body of insects and the body of flesh.

['ZH_T33_1708_01b:0385b07_17']	八地以上，一切煩惱不現前故，唯受變易。	八地以上，一切煩惱不現前故，唯受變易。	01b	Because above the eighth ground, all afflictions do not manifest, one only experiences the transformation.

Therefore, it says the remaining karmic results of the habitual tendencies of ignorance are empty.
['ZH_T33_1708_01b:0385b11_4']	若具分別，廣如別章。	若具分別，廣如別章。	01b	If one wishes to distinguish them in detail, it is as extensively explained in other chapters.

The innate afflictions are the companions that assist in their arising. At that time, they are forever without subsequent existence, and therefore it is said to be the latent tendency of the companion-destroyer.
