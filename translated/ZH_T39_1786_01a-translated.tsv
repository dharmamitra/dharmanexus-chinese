['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c20_18']	前釋四教，通真含中得名理深；	前釋四教，通真含中得名理深；	Previously, the four teachings were explained, and the true [teaching] that includes the middle is called the profound principle;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c21_11']	今結四教，別教乃云破淺明深。	今結四教，別教乃云破淺明深。	Now, the four teachings are concluded, and the distinct teaching is said to refute the shallow and clarify the profound.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c22_1']	豈可通教真中俱淺？	豈可通教真中俱淺？	How can the true [teaching] of the common [teaching] be both shallow and profound?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c22_3']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c23_1']	通理雖深，為攝二乘及鈍菩薩，故兼淺理。	通理雖深，為攝二乘及鈍菩薩，故兼淺理。	Although the principle of the common [teaching] is profound, it is in order to include the two vehicles and dull bodhisattvas, and therefore it also includes shallow principles.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c24_13']	今結別教，獨菩薩法、唯談深理，故以唯深破於兼淺，與前列釋義不相違。	今結別教，獨菩薩法、唯談深理，故以唯深破於兼淺，與前列釋義不相違。	Now, the distinct teaching is concluded, which is exclusively the Dharma for bodhisattvas and only discusses the profound principle, and therefore it refutes the shallow by means of the profound alone, and it does not contradict the meaning of the previous explanation.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c25_3']	三、「此經」下，示部具四。	三、「此經」下，示部具四。	Third, below this sūtra, it shows that the four [teachings] are complete in this text.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c26_15']	以圓三觀觀於陰等，修惡之心即是性惡，名惡法界，無法不收。	以圓三觀觀於陰等，修惡之心即是性惡，名惡法界，無法不收。	Using the three contemplations of the perfect teaching to contemplate the aggregates and so forth, the mind of cultivated evil is precisely the nature of evil, called the Dharma realm of evil, with no Dharma not included.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c27_4']	體是三德，復名三諦。	體是三德，復名三諦。	Its essence is the three virtues, also called the three truths.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c27_19']	稱諦而照，觀境不異，故名為如。	稱諦而照，觀境不異，故名為如。	In accordance with the truth, the contemplation of the realm is no different, thus it is called suchness.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0085c29_18']	境即正觀者，境是本覺，起為始覺，雖分新舊，覺體不殊，故得名為境即正觀，是義方成。	境即正觀者，境是本覺，起為始覺，雖分新舊，覺體不殊，故得名為境即正觀，是義方成。	The realm is precisely right contemplation means that the realm is original enlightenment, which gives rise to subsequent enlightenment. Although there is a distinction between the new and old, the essence of enlightenment is not different, thus it can be called the realm is precisely right contemplation, and this meaning is then established.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a01_12']	若不爾者，境照境等四句豈立？	若不爾者，境照境等四句豈立？	If it were not so, how could the four statements such as the realm illuminating the realm and so forth be established?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a02_17']	經言「等」者，若觀頑境偏小忘心，假立真如等，皆名邪觀。	經言「等」者，若觀頑境偏小忘心，假立真如等，皆名邪觀。	The sūtra says and so forth. If one contemplates an insentient realm or a biased and small forgetting of the mind, provisionally establishing true suchness and so forth, all are called wrong contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a05_2']	今茲正觀雖非約行，行人若欲攝事成理、即聞而修，必須於所觀心簡於十境，陰境常有、餘九待發。	今茲正觀雖非約行，行人若欲攝事成理、即聞而修，必須於所觀心簡於十境，陰境常有、餘九待發。	Now, although this right contemplation is not about practice, if a practitioner wishes to subsume events to form principle and practice immediately upon hearing, they must select from the ten realms within the contemplated mind. The realm of the aggregates always exists, while the other nine await arising.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a06_7']	於能觀觀須識十乘，上根修一、中根至七、下根具七。	於能觀觀須識十乘，上根修一、中根至七、下根具七。	In contemplating the contemplator, one must understand the ten approaches. Those of superior faculties cultivate one, those of middling faculties cultivate up to seven, and those of inferior faculties cultivate all seven.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a08_5']	若自未解摩訶止觀，當依師友一一咨詢，明識藥病方可修之，勿謂一句修行即足。	若自未解摩訶止觀，當依師友一一咨詢，明識藥病方可修之，勿謂一句修行即足。	If one does not yet understand the Great Calming and Contemplation, one should rely on teachers and friends to inquire about each point, clearly understand the medicine for illnesses, and then cultivate it. Do not think that a single phrase of practice is sufficient.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a08_15']	下去觀解，准此應知。	下去觀解，准此應知。	The contemplation and understanding below should be understood in accordance with this.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a10_12']	外人我見故多師心，阿難師佛故唱我聞。	外人我見故多師心，阿難師佛故唱我聞。	Because outsiders have the view of self, they often follow the mind of the teacher. Ananda followed the Buddha as his teacher, so he proclaimed I hear.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a10_17']	二、真諦。	二、真諦。	Second, True Recompense.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a11_11']	我能受持佛所說法，故是器義。	我能受持佛所說法，故是器義。	I am able to receive and uphold the Dharma spoken by the Buddha, so it is the meaning of being a vessel.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a12_1']	簡三非器，顯成三慧。	簡三非器，顯成三慧。	It distinguishes the three that are not vessels and reveals the accomplishment of the three kinds of wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a12_19']	雖未分於四教慧別，然釋我聞尤過舊解。	雖未分於四教慧別，然釋我聞尤過舊解。	Although it does not yet distinguish the differences in wisdom of the four teachings, the explanation of I hear is still superior to the old explanations.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a13_6']	三、《釋謂》。	三、《釋謂》。	Third, the commentary says.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a14_3']	彼明耳識從四緣生，一空、二根、三境、四作意。	彼明耳識從四緣生，一空、二根、三境、四作意。	That passage clarifies that ear consciousness arises from four conditions: space, faculties, objects, and attention.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a15_7']	今云不壞是根、可聞處是境、諦聽是作意，唯闕空緣。	今云不壞是根、可聞處是境、諦聽是作意，唯闕空緣。	Now it says undistorted is the faculty, audible is the object, and listen carefully is attention, lacking only the condition of space.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a15_21']	下云「因緣和合」，義可兼之。	下云「因緣和合」，義可兼之。	The passage below says the combination of causes and conditions, which can include that meaning.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a16_8']	即四緣和合方發耳識。	即四緣和合方發耳識。	Only when the four conditions combine does ear consciousness arise.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a17_4']	不言耳聞稱我聞者，我是耳主故。	不言耳聞稱我聞者，我是耳主故。	It does not say ear hears but I hear because I am the master of the ear.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a17_20']	新云耳識九緣生，備於《唯識》也。	新云耳識九緣生，備於《唯識》也。	The new explanation is that ear consciousness arises from nine conditions, which is fully explained in the Vijñaptimātratā.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a18_12']	二、「師釋」下，今釋，二：	二、「師釋」下，今釋，二：	Second, the present explanation, which has two parts:

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a19_1']	初、我聞各釋，二：	初、我聞各釋，二：	First, the individual explanations of I and hear, which has two parts:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a19_7']	初、明四我。	初、明四我。	First, clarifying the four kinds of I.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a20_3']	此我我等，例於《大經》生生等四句而立。	此我我等，例於《大經》生生等四句而立。	This I and I are exemplified by the four propositions of born from birth and so on in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a20_14']	然我是假名，攬陰而有。	然我是假名，攬陰而有。	However, this I is a provisional name, formed by grasping the aggregates.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a21_12']	陰法既有生生等四，我隨實法豈不然乎？	陰法既有生生等四，我隨實法豈不然乎？	Since the dharmas of the aggregates have the four propositions of born from birth and so on, how could the I not be the same as the actual dharmas?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a23_12']	如釋生生云「大生生小生」，此乃生滅生於生滅，攬生滅法成生滅我，故例生生成於我我。	如釋生生云「大生生小生」，此乃生滅生於生滅，攬生滅法成生滅我，故例生生成於我我。	As it is said that the great birth gives rise to the small birth, this is the birth and death giving rise to birth and death, grasping the dharmas of birth and death to form the self of birth and death, therefore it is given as an analogy for birth and death giving rise to the self.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a24_11']	雖是空觀而非體空，是故三藏當於初句。	雖是空觀而非體空，是故三藏當於初句。	Although this is the contemplation of emptiness, it is not the contemplation of the essence of emptiness, therefore the Tripiṭaka [Teaching] is to be placed in the first phrase.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a25_19']	又復應知假實生滅，眾生本爾而不覺知，今稟此教稱本而觀。	又復應知假實生滅，眾生本爾而不覺知，今稟此教稱本而觀。	Moreover, one should know that the arising and ceasing of the provisional and real [selves] is the original state of sentient beings, yet they are unaware of it. Now, receiving this teaching, one contemplates in accordance with the original [nature].
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a26_4']	豈唯此教？	豈唯此教？	How could this teaching be the only one?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a26_9']	下三皆爾。	下三皆爾。	The three lower [teachings] are all like this.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a27_13']	通教實法生即不生，故陰中我即無我也，故屬次句。	通教實法生即不生，故陰中我即無我也，故屬次句。	In the Shared Teaching, the arising of real dharmas is precisely non-arising, therefore the self within the aggregates is precisely non-self, thus it belongs to the second phrase.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086a28_12']	別人知陰不生而生，是故觀於無我而我。	別人知陰不生而生，是故觀於無我而我。	The Distinct Teaching knows that the aggregates are non-arising yet arising, therefore one contemplates non-self yet self.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b01_15']	蓋由此教元知真我，見慢盛故，初觀無我、次破無我，建立於我、後入真我，是故此教當第三句。	蓋由此教元知真我，見慢盛故，初觀無我、次破無我，建立於我、後入真我，是故此教當第三句。	This is because this teaching originally knows the true self, but due to the arrogance of views, one first contemplates non-self, then destroys non-self, establishes self, and later enters the true self, therefore this teaching is to be placed in the third phrase.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b02_17']	圓人即達現前假實不生不生，攬常住陰而成真我。	圓人即達現前假實不生不生，攬常住陰而成真我。	The perfect teaching immediately understands that the present provisional and real are unborn and not unborn, and forms the true self by embracing the eternally abiding aggregates.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b04_10']	我既即中，二諦皆趣，故云我無我而不二真我義，是故此教當第四句。	我既即中，二諦皆趣，故云我無我而不二真我義，是故此教當第四句。	Since the self is precisely the middle, both truths are directed towards it, therefore it is said that self and non-self are not two. The meaning of the true self is thus. Therefore, this teaching corresponds to the fourth statement.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b05_18']	教本被機，故四我義配四根性，令後說者如上分別，故注云云。	教本被機，故四我義配四根性，令後說者如上分別，故注云云。	Since the teaching is originally given to those with faculties, the four meanings of self are matched with the four kinds of faculties, causing later expounders to distinguish as above. Therefore, the commentary says and so on.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b06_3']	二、明四聞。	二、明四聞。	Second, clarifying the four kinds of hearing.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b07_2']	我是聞主、聞是我用，主是假人、用是實法。	我是聞主、聞是我用，主是假人、用是實法。	Self is the master of hearing, and hearing is the function of self. The master is a provisional person, and the function is a real dharma.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b07_14']	然若解生義，則聞義自顯。	然若解生義，則聞義自顯。	However, if one understands the meaning of arising, then the meaning of hearing will be revealed by itself.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b08_15']	但生是總論緣起，聞乃別從說聽，不無少異。	但生是總論緣起，聞乃別從說聽，不無少異。	It's just that arising is a general discussion of dependent origination, while hearing is specifically from speaking and listening, there is a slight difference.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b09_10']	從聞因緣而有餘聞，故曰聞聞。	從聞因緣而有餘聞，故曰聞聞。	There is hearing from the causes and conditions of hearing, therefore it is called hearing hearing.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b10_5']	既從緣生，終歸壞滅，此聞生滅也。	既從緣生，終歸壞滅，此聞生滅也。	Since it arises from conditions, it will eventually return to destruction. This is the arising and ceasing of hearing.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b11_7']	聞無四性，當處無聞，故曰聞不聞，此聞無生也。	聞無四性，當處無聞，故曰聞不聞，此聞無生也。	Hearing the four natures are nonexistent, there is no hearing in the present moment, so it is said hearing is not hearing. This is the unborn nature of hearing.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b12_8']	真雖不聞，俗中有聞，故曰不聞聞，此聞無量也。	真雖不聞，俗中有聞，故曰不聞聞，此聞無量也。	Although the truth is not heard, there is hearing in the conventional. Therefore, it is said not hearing is hearing. This is the immeasurable nature of hearing.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b12_18']	二諦即中，故云不聞；	二諦即中，故云不聞；	The two truths are the middle way, so it is said not hearing;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b13_8']	中亦叵得，復云不聞。	中亦叵得，復云不聞。	The middle way is also unobtainable, so it is said not hearing.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b14_6']	四十九年不說一字，何有中邊而可聞耶？	四十九年不說一字，何有中邊而可聞耶？	For forty-nine years, not a single word was spoken. How could there be a middle or edge to be heard?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b14_12']	此聞無作也。	此聞無作也。	This is the unconditioned nature of hearing.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b14_17']	注意同前。	注意同前。	Pay attention as before.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b15_12']	二、「有四」下，我聞共釋，三：	二、「有四」下，我聞共釋，三：	Second, below there are four, the common explanation of I hear has three parts:

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b16_13']	三藏教中，阿難一身而有四德，故受四名。	三藏教中，阿難一身而有四德，故受四名。	In the Tripiṭaka teachings, Ānanda has four virtues in one body, so he receives four names.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b17_8']	典藏出《阿含》，餘三出《正法念》。	典藏出《阿含》，餘三出《正法念》。	The canon of treasures comes from the Āgamas, the other three come from the Samantapāsādikā.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b18_1']	今演小名對於四教，義與名合。	今演小名對於四教，義與名合。	Now the small name is applied to the four teachings, the meaning matches the name.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b18_11']	阿難梵語，歡喜華言。	阿難梵語，歡喜華言。	Ānanda is a Sanskrit word, meaning joy in Chinese.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b19_6']	佛成道夜生，舉國歡喜，因以為名。	佛成道夜生，舉國歡喜，因以為名。	He was born on the night the Buddha attained enlightenment, and the whole country rejoiced, thus he was named.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b20_6']	從緣立名，符生滅法，傳持三藏，宜用此名。	從緣立名，符生滅法，傳持三藏，宜用此名。	Establishing names based on conditions accords with the dharma of arising and ceasing. To transmit the Tripiṭaka, this name is appropriate.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b21_4']	通教所說體事即理，異凡俗見，宜用賢名。	通教所說體事即理，異凡俗見，宜用賢名。	The essence of phenomena taught in the Shared Teaching is principle, different from the views of ordinary people. It is appropriate to use the name virtuous.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b22_3']	別教五談塵沙佛法，多所主領，宜典藏名。	別教五談塵沙佛法，多所主領，宜典藏名。	The five discussions of the Distinct Teaching on the dust-like Buddha Dharma, which are mostly presided over, are appropriate to be called treasury.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b23_2']	圓教始終詮法界理，既深且廣，宜用海名。	圓教始終詮法界理，既深且廣，宜用海名。	The principle of the Dharma realm expounded from beginning to end in the Perfect Teaching is both profound and vast. It is appropriate to use the name ocean.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b23_17']	二、「歡喜」下，能承四佛，四：	二、「歡喜」下，能承四佛，四：	Second, joy and below, able to receive the four Buddhas, four:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b23_22']	初、三藏。	初、三藏。	First, Tripiṭaka.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b24_16']	此教析法，空不含中，故見佛身唯是丈六。	此教析法，空不含中，故見佛身唯是丈六。	This teaching analyzes phenomena, emptiness does not contain the middle, therefore seeing the Buddha's body is only six feet tall.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b25_4']	二、「賢阿」下，通教。	二、「賢阿」下，通教。	Second, virtuous and below, Shared Teaching.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b25_19']	觀既體法，顯二種空，謂但不但。	觀既體法，顯二種空，謂但不但。	Contemplation is already the essence of phenomena, revealing two kinds of emptiness, namely, only and not only.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b27_1']	鈍根菩薩同二乘人唯見但空，無中實故，非色心本。	鈍根菩薩同二乘人唯見但空，無中實故，非色心本。	Dull-faculty bodhisattvas are the same as those of the two vehicles, only seeing the emptiness of only, without the middle reality, therefore not the basis of form and mind.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086b28_10']	故佛元由誓無殘習，幻出身智終歸灰滅，色有分齊故云丈六。	故佛元由誓無殘習，幻出身智終歸灰滅，色有分齊故云丈六。	Therefore, the Buddha originally has no remaining habits, and his illusory body and wisdom will eventually return to ashes and disappear. The form has a limited extent, so it is called the sixteen-foot Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c02_7']	若利菩薩，受別圓接解不但空，空是本覺中實之體，是妙色心佛位證得，所有身智稱體無邊，故名尊特尊崇奇特，亦名報身。	若利菩薩，受別圓接解不但空，空是本覺中實之體，是妙色心佛位證得，所有身智稱體無邊，故名尊特尊崇奇特，亦名報身。	If a bodhisattva of sharp faculties receives the separate and perfect teachings, he understands that emptiness is not just empty. It is the essence of the fundamentally enlightened mind, which is the wondrous form and mind attained by the Buddha's stage. The body and wisdom are in accordance with the boundless essence, and therefore it is called the majestic and special body, also called the reward body.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c03_6']	秖一佛身，由利鈍機見二種狀，故云合身。	秖一佛身，由利鈍機見二種狀，故云合身。	This is just one Buddha body, seen in two different ways due to the faculties of sharp and dull. Therefore, it is said to be a combined body.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c03_15']	通教佛身須作此辯。	通教佛身須作此辯。	The Buddha body of the Shared Teaching must be explained in this way.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c05_7']	應了鈍根見佛，縱高十里乃至百億，以依但空，亦非尊特，有分齊故。	應了鈍根見佛，縱高十里乃至百億，以依但空，亦非尊特，有分齊故。	One must understand that the dull-facultied see the Buddha, even if he is ten li or even a billion li tall, because he relies on mere emptiness, it is also not the majestic and special body, because it has a limited extent.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c07_13']	若利人見丈六八尺，既依中道亦無分齊，是故下文金龍尊王偈讚三十二相，《文句》解云正歎尊特。	若利人見丈六八尺，既依中道亦無分齊，是故下文金龍尊王偈讚三十二相，《文句》解云正歎尊特。	If a person of sharp faculties sees the sixteen-foot or eight-foot Buddha, since he relies on the Middle Way, it is also without limited extent. Therefore, the verse praised by King Golden Dragon in the following text praises the thirty-two marks. The Explanation of the Text says it is correctly praising the majestic and special body.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c10_2']	此教初心便聞但中，中雖不具九界依正，非無佛界妙色妙心，是故見佛唯無分齊尊特身也。	此教初心便聞但中，中雖不具九界依正，非無佛界妙色妙心，是故見佛唯無分齊尊特身也。	In this teaching, beginners immediately hear only the Middle. Although the Middle does not fully include the nine realms of依正, it is not without the wondrous form and wondrous mind of the Buddha realm. Therefore, seeing the Buddha is only the boundless majestic body.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c11_2']	此教始終不共二乘及住空菩薩修證故也。	此教始終不共二乘及住空菩薩修證故也。	This teaching is not shared with the two vehicles or with bodhisattvas who abide in emptiness from beginning to end.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c11_12']	四、「海」下，圓教。	四、「海」下，圓教。	Fourth, below ocean, is the Perfect Teaching.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c12_6']	此教所說世間相常，故一切法無非中道。	此教所說世間相常，故一切法無非中道。	The characteristics of the world spoken of in this teaching are constant, and therefore all dharmas are none other than the Middle Way.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c13_11']	雖與別人同見尊特，彼兼別修、此皆性具，故龍女云：	雖與別人同見尊特，彼兼別修、此皆性具，故龍女云：	Although it is the same as the Distinct Teaching in seeing the majestic body, that teaching also cultivates the distinct, while this teaching is all endowed with the nature. Therefore, the Dragon Princess says:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c14_2']	「微妙淨法身，具相三十二。	「微妙淨法身，具相三十二。	The subtle, wondrous, pure Dharma body, endowed with the thirty-two marks.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c14_17']	」欲彰全性，是故從勝特名法身。	」欲彰全性，是故從勝特名法身。	In order to show that it is all the nature, therefore it takes the superior majestic body as the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c17_1']	故此教人觀性德苦樂而興與拔，以即理毒害為所消伏，修德三因名性德行，報應二身即名法身。	故此教人觀性德苦樂而興與拔，以即理毒害為所消伏，修德三因名性德行，報應二身即名法身。	Therefore, the people of this teaching contemplate the suffering and happiness of the nature-born virtues and arouse the giving and taking, taking the poison and harm that are identical with principle as what is to be subdued and pacified. The three causes of cultivated virtues are called the practice of nature-born virtues, and the two bodies of reward and response are called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c18_19']	蓋欲以性而泯於修，苦則即拔無拔、毒則即消無消、行乃即修無修、佛乃即證無證。	蓋欲以性而泯於修，苦則即拔無拔、毒則即消無消、行乃即修無修、佛乃即證無證。	It seems to want to use nature to obliterate cultivation, so suffering is then extracted without extraction, poison is then dissolved without dissolution, practice is then cultivated without cultivation, and Buddhahood is then realized without realization.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c20_3']	阿難傳此無作四諦，即說無說，是故親承法身佛也。	阿難傳此無作四諦，即說無說，是故親承法身佛也。	Ānanda transmitted this unconditioned four truths, which is to speak without speaking, and therefore he personally received from the Dharma-body Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c20_15']	三、「此」下，部有四機。	三、「此」下，部有四機。	Third, below this, there are four capacities in the text.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c22_11']	以三乘中聲聞緣覺須論藏通，若明菩薩須該四教。	以三乘中聲聞緣覺須論藏通，若明菩薩須該四教。	Because within the three vehicles, the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas must discuss the Tripiṭaka and Shared, while if clarifying the bodhisattvas, it must encompass the four teachings.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c23_11']	三乘總論、四教別辨，聽既三乘，說必四佛；	三乘總論、四教別辨，聽既三乘，說必四佛；	The three vehicles are discussed in general, and the four teachings are distinguished in detail. Since the listeners are of the three vehicles, the speakers must be the four Buddhas;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c24_2']	既一音各解，亦一身異見。	既一音各解，亦一身異見。	Since there is understanding with a single sound, there is also different views with a single body.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c26_12']	攀上等者，是有漏禪六行觀也。	攀上等者，是有漏禪六行觀也。	Grasping at the higher and so forth refers to the six kinds of contemplation in contaminated meditation.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c27_13']	攀上淨妙離，厭下苦麁障，約於九地迭論上下。	攀上淨妙離，厭下苦麁障，約於九地迭論上下。	Grasping at the higher as pure, wonderful, and free from, and despising the lower as suffering, coarse, and obstructed, are discussed in terms of the nine grounds mutually considering higher and lower.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0086c29_15']	我我聞聞是三藏中生滅俗境，前約三乘知解生滅觀之入理，今就凡夫不知而修但成世禪。	我我聞聞是三藏中生滅俗境，前約三乘知解生滅觀之入理，今就凡夫不知而修但成世禪。	I and hearing are the conditioned and changing conventional realms within the Tripiṭaka. Previously, in terms of the realization and understanding of the Three Vehicles, they are contemplated as arising and ceasing, and one enters the principle. Now, in terms of ordinary beings who do not know, they are cultivated but only become worldly meditations.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a01_17']	既是俗境，知與不知法本生滅，故當生生句。	既是俗境，知與不知法本生滅，故當生生句。	Since they are conventional realms, whether one knows or not, the dharmas are originally arising and ceasing, so they correspond to the phrase arising of arising.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a03_3']	今宗解之，或從所化機、或約能觀觀，析體二觀，俗異真同。	今宗解之，或從所化機、或約能觀觀，析體二觀，俗異真同。	Now, in the Zong (school), it is explained that either from the perspective of the transformed capacities or in terms of the contemplating contemplation, the two contemplations of analysis and essence, the conventional is different while the true is the same.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a03_17']	前約俗異，故將析法別對初句；	前約俗異，故將析法別對初句；	Previously, in terms of the difference in the conventional, therefore, the contemplation of analyzing dharmas is specifically matched with the first phrase;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a05_1']	今就真同，故以析體共對次句，後之二觀不殊前對。	今就真同，故以析體共對次句，後之二觀不殊前對。	Now, in terms of the sameness of the true, therefore, the contemplation of analyzing and essence is matched together with the next phrase. The latter two contemplations are no different from the previous matches.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a05_15']	又前約教，我聞四句可對四人；	又前約教，我聞四句可對四人；	Moreover, previously in terms of the teachings, the four phrases of I hear can be matched with four kinds of people;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a07_16']	今論修觀，須就一人一念而照，故《釋籤》一心三觀於一念心見四四諦，尚具四趣，豈闕世禪？	今論修觀，須就一人一念而照，故《釋籤》一心三觀於一念心見四四諦，尚具四趣，豈闕世禪？	Now, discussing the cultivation of contemplation, it is necessary to illuminate it based on one person and one thought. Therefore, the Shiqian says that the three contemplations of one mind see the four four truths in one thought, and it still includes the four destinies. How could it lack worldly meditation?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a08_8']	故說必次第，約人辨相故；	故說必次第，約人辨相故；	Therefore, it is said that there must be a sequence, because it distinguishes the characteristics based on people;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a08_19']	修無前後，唯成圓觀故。	修無前後，唯成圓觀故。	but there is no sequence in cultivation, because it only forms the perfect contemplation.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a14_16']	若謂眾生心不高下中平之時，即是與佛合一時也，故云平時即是一時。	若謂眾生心不高下中平之時，即是與佛合一時也，故云平時即是一時。	If it is said that when the minds of sentient beings are neither lofty nor low, but level and even, that is the same time as the Buddha, therefore it is said that the level time is the same time.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a20_1']	下謂耽戀五欲荒迷不捨，何能受道？	下謂耽戀五欲荒迷不捨，何能受道？	Low refers to being addicted to the five desires, confused and not letting go, how can one receive the Way?

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a27_2']	智即是機、諦即是應，智諦合時名感應一。	智即是機、諦即是應，智諦合時名感應一。	Wisdom is the stimulus, and truth is the response. When wisdom and truth come together, it is called the oneness of stimulus and response.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a28_3']	佛以三諦而為其體，不以此體應於眾生。	佛以三諦而為其體，不以此體應於眾生。	The Buddha takes the three truths as his essence, and does not use this essence to respond to sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087a29_11']	眾生無由智合於諦，如須菩提石室觀空，釋迦歎言得見我身。	眾生無由智合於諦，如須菩提石室觀空，釋迦歎言得見我身。	Sentient beings have no way to unite with truth through wisdom. For example, when Subhuti contemplated emptiness in a stone chamber, Shakyamuni praised him, saying he saw his body.

When sentient beings cultivate wholesome dharmas and see the truth, it is the time when the response of the Buddha and the receptivity of sentient beings coincide.

['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087b22_20']	佛既翻覺，而有三身，即是三種覺智所成。	佛既翻覺，而有三身，即是三種覺智所成。	Since Buddha is translated as enlightened, and there are three bodies, they are all accomplished by the three kinds of enlightened wisdom.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087b24_11']	若一切智成於三藏丈六佛，依道種智有二佛者，此智論於界內外故。	若一切智成於三藏丈六佛，依道種智有二佛者，此智論於界內外故。	If the wisdom of all modes accomplishes the Buddha of the three hidden teachings, and the wisdom of the path of the various aspects has two Buddhas, this wisdom is in terms of the internal and external realms.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087b25_15']	界內道種成於通教但空丈六，以鈍菩薩為空出假故；	界內道種成於通教但空丈六，以鈍菩薩為空出假故；	The path of the various aspects in the internal realm accomplishes the Buddha of emptiness of the hidden teachings, using dull bodhisattvas for emptiness and leaving behind the provisional;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087b27_1']	界外道種成於通別但中尊特，以二菩薩為中出假故；	界外道種成於通別但中尊特，以二菩薩為中出假故；	The path of the various aspects in the external realm accomplishes the Buddha of the middle of the hidden and distinct teachings, using the two bodhisattvas for the middle and leaving behind the provisional;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087b28_4']	一切種智成於圓教及通別教諸法趣中，法身佛也。	一切種智成於圓教及通別教諸法趣中，法身佛也。	The wisdom of the path of the various aspects accomplishes the Buddha of the perfect teachings and the various dharmas leading to the middle, the Dharma body Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087b28_14']	雖被四機，秖是三佛。	雖被四機，秖是三佛。	Although there are four kinds of capacities, they are only the three Buddhas.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087b29_10']	此之三佛不可定一，無差即差故；	此之三佛不可定一，無差即差故；	These three Buddhas cannot be definitely one, because without distinction there is distinction;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c01_1']	不可定異，差即無差故。	不可定異，差即無差故。	they cannot be definitely different, because with distinction there is no distinction.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c01_12']	須忘一異，是祕密藏故；	須忘一異，是祕密藏故；	One must forget about one and different, because this is the secret treasury;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c02_2']	而論一異，跨節當分故。	而論一異，跨節當分故。	yet one discusses one and different, because it is across the joints and within the division.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c02_7']	二、約觀。	二、約觀。	Second, in terms of contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c03_4']	三觀所覺皆云諸法者，一一覺於三諦也。	三觀所覺皆云諸法者，一一覺於三諦也。	The various dharmas that are realized by the three contemplations are each realized in the three truths.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c04_6']	故空覺三諦，差別情忘，名第一義空，故曰一相。	故空覺三諦，差別情忘，名第一義空，故曰一相。	Therefore, the three truths realized through emptiness, with the forgetting of discriminating emotions, are called the ultimate emptiness, thus it is said one characteristic.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c05_5']	假覺三諦，皆能立法，名如來藏，故曰種種相。	假覺三諦，皆能立法，名如來藏，故曰種種相。	The three truths realized through the provisional, all able to establish principles, are called the Tathāgatagarbha, thus it is said various characteristics.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c06_12']	中覺三諦，遮照同時，名第一義理，故曰無一異相亦一異相。	中覺三諦，遮照同時，名第一義理，故曰無一異相亦一異相。	The three truths realized through the middle, with the simultaneous concealment and revelation, are called the ultimate principle, thus it is said without characteristics of one or different, yet with characteristics of one and different.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c07_10']	前約教釋，故以三智別示三身攝於四教；	前約教釋，故以三智別示三身攝於四教；	Previously, in the explanation in terms of teachings, the three wisdoms were specifically shown to include the four teachings;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c08_1']	今既約觀，須唯在圓。	今既約觀，須唯在圓。	now, since it is in terms of contemplation, it must be only in the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c09_4']	圓觀若成，四教三身不求自獲，塵去鑑淨像現隨形。	圓觀若成，四教三身不求自獲，塵去鑑淨像現隨形。	If the perfect contemplation is accomplished, the three bodies of the four teachings will be attained without seeking. When the dust is removed and the mirror is clean, the reflection appears according to the form.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c09_14']	令此分別，故注云云。	令此分別，故注云云。	This distinction is made, hence the annotation says and so on.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c10_3']	五、「住者」下，住處，二：	五、「住者」下，住處，二：	Fifth, under abode, there are two parts to the abode:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c10_8']	初、雙標。	初、雙標。	First, a double indication.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c10_15']	佛，能住人也。	佛，能住人也。	The Buddha is the person who abides.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c10_23']	城山，所住處也。	城山，所住處也。	The city and mountain are the places where he abides.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c11_9']	人必有法，以為能住。	人必有法，以為能住。	People must have the Dharma as that which enables them to abide.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c12_3']	如世惡人，必以惡法住於家舍；	如世惡人，必以惡法住於家舍；	Just as evil people in the world must use evil dharmas to abide in their homes;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c12_13']	善人善法，住舍亦然。	善人善法，住舍亦然。	Good people and good dharmas abide in houses in the same way.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c13_17']	今云佛住王城耆山，豈得不以首楞嚴定為能住法耶？	今云佛住王城耆山，豈得不以首楞嚴定為能住法耶？	Now, if it is said that the Buddha abides in the king's city and Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, how could it not be that the Śūraṃgama Samādhi is the Dharma that enables him to abide?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c15_4']	故《普賢觀》云「釋迦牟尼名毘盧遮那，此佛住處名常寂光。	故《普賢觀》云「釋迦牟尼名毘盧遮那，此佛住處名常寂光。	Therefore, the Samantabhadra Contemplation Sutra says, Śākyamuni is called Vairocana. The place where this Buddha abides is called the eternally quiescent light.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c16_7']	」牟尼是人、寂光是法，此之人法自可分於能住所住。	」牟尼是人、寂光是法，此之人法自可分於能住所住。	Muni refers to the person, and eternally quiescent light refers to the Dharma. This person and Dharma can be distinguished as that which enables abiding and that which is to be abided in.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c16_17']	若望山城，俱為能住；	若望山城，俱為能住；	If we look at the mountain and city, they are both that which enables abiding;
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c17_7']	山望寂光，為所住處。	山望寂光，為所住處。	The mountain is contemplated as the Land of Ultimate Bliss, which is the place of abiding.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c18_14']	處隨法轉，其猶還丹、點鐵成金，故摩竭提阿蘭若處名寂滅場。	處隨法轉，其猶還丹、點鐵成金，故摩竭提阿蘭若處名寂滅場。	The place follows the transformation of the Dharma, just as the elixir transforms iron into gold. Therefore, the place of tranquility and cessation in Magadha is called the field of ultimate cessation.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c19_4']	今之城山豈其不爾？	今之城山豈其不爾？	How could the present city and mountain not be so?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c20_15']	故知不辨能住心法，但云色身住於土石，則大小心境之談便成無用。	故知不辨能住心法，但云色身住於土石，則大小心境之談便成無用。	Therefore, it should be known that if one does not distinguish the mind and Dharma that can abide, but only says that the physical body abides in soil and stone, then the teachings on the mind and objects of the Great and Small Vehicles would become useless.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c21_11']	是以雙標能住所住，其有旨乎！	是以雙標能住所住，其有旨乎！	Therefore, the reason for simultaneously indicating both that which can abide and that which is abided in must have a profound meaning!
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c21_24']	二、「真諦」下，雙釋，二：	二、「真諦」下，雙釋，二：	Second, the explanation of both, which is twofold:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c22_8']	初、明能住法，二：	初、明能住法，二：	First, clarifying the Dharma that can abide, which is twofold:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c22_15']	初、舊解，二：	初、舊解，二：	First, the old interpretations, which are twofold:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c22_20']	初、真諦。	初、真諦。	First, Zhendi.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c23_17']	此師釋住，不但色質住於城山，故明八種能住之法：	此師釋住，不但色質住於城山，故明八種能住之法：	This master's interpretation of abiding not only means that the physical body abides in the city and mountain, but also clarifies the eight kinds of Dharma that can abide:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c24_9']	一住大千，顯能住化廣。	一住大千，顯能住化廣。	First, abiding in the great trichiliocosm, showing that the ability to transform widely can abide.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c24_19']	二住依止，顯今能住。	二住依止，顯今能住。	Second, abiding in the basis, showing that the present ability to abide.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c25_12']	三住五分，顯於能住無漏五陰。	三住五分，顯於能住無漏五陰。	Third, abiding in the five parts, showing that the ability to abide is the pure five aggregates.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c28_9']	五分者，謂戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見，謂無學道共戒、滅盡定、無生慧、有餘解脫、照解脫智眼名為知見，謂自知是初果乃至四果也。	五分者，謂戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見，謂無學道共戒、滅盡定、無生慧、有餘解脫、照解脫智眼名為知見，謂自知是初果乃至四果也。	The five parts refer to precepts, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge and vision of liberation. The precepts shared by the path of no-more-learning, the concentration of cessation, the wisdom of non-arising, the remaining liberation, and the knowledge and vision of the eye of liberation are called the knowledge and vision. It means knowing oneself to be the first fruit up to the fourth fruit.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0087c29_4']	是則前三并在於果，方名法身。	是則前三并在於果，方名法身。	This is then the first three, which are only called the Dharma body when they are in the fruit.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a02_14']	言壽命現在者，以入無餘則五分滅故，灰身則戒、定、有餘解脫滅，滅智則慧及知見滅，故壽命現在五分得住。	言壽命現在者，以入無餘則五分滅故，灰身則戒、定、有餘解脫滅，滅智則慧及知見滅，故壽命現在五分得住。	As for the present life span, entering no-remainder means the five parts cease, so the ashes of the body mean the precepts, concentration, and remaining liberation cease, and the cessation of knowledge means wisdom and the knowledge and vision cease, so the present life span of the five parts can remain.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a03_13']	四住威儀，行住坐臥皆有法則，故能利物。	四住威儀，行住坐臥皆有法則，故能利物。	The four dwelling deportments, walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, all have rules, so one can benefit beings.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a05_2']	五天住，住禪定者，禪則四禪、定謂四空，是色無色二界天法故。	五天住，住禪定者，禪則四禪、定謂四空，是色無色二界天法故。	The fifth is the heavenly dwelling, dwelling in meditation. Meditation refers to the four meditations, and concentration refers to the four formless concentrations. This is the Dharma of the heavens of the form and formless realms.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a05_21']	六梵住，住四等，眾生無量、我心常等故。	六梵住，住四等，眾生無量、我心常等故。	The sixth is the Brahma dwelling, dwelling in the four equalities, because beings are immeasurable, and one's mind is always equal.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a06_17']	四禪加修慈悲喜捨生梵天王，故云梵住。	四禪加修慈悲喜捨生梵天王，故云梵住。	In the fourth dhyāna, by cultivating loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, one is born as Brahmā Heaven King, thus it is called the abode of Brahmā.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a07_7']	文無喜捨，略也。	文無喜捨，略也。	The text lacks joy and equanimity, it is abbreviated.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a08_14']	七聖住，住三三昧，謂空、無相、無願，此三聖人所修，故云聖住。	七聖住，住三三昧，謂空、無相、無願，此三聖人所修，故云聖住。	The seven holy abodes refer to abiding in the three samādhis, namely emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. Since these three are cultivated by holy beings, they are called the holy abodes.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a09_15']	八大處住，即常寂光，言慮已絕，故云第一義也。	八大處住，即常寂光，言慮已絕，故云第一義也。	The eight great abodes refer to the eternally quiescent light. Since thoughts and considerations have already ceased, it is called the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a10_8']	此之八義，皆是如來能住法也。	此之八義，皆是如來能住法也。	These eight meanings are all the dharmas that the Tathāgata is able to abide in.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a10_15']	二、《釋論》。	二、《釋論》。	Second, the commentary.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a12_1']	《大品》云「佛住王舍城」，龍樹約四義釋能住法，謂天、梵、聖、佛也。	《大品》云「佛住王舍城」，龍樹約四義釋能住法，謂天、梵、聖、佛也。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says that the Buddha abides in Rājagṛha. Nāgârjuna explains the dharma of being able to abide in terms of four meanings, namely heavenly, brahma, holy, and buddha.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a13_1']	真諦八法不出此四，是故大師以四攝之。	真諦八法不出此四，是故大師以四攝之。	The eight dharmas of Satyasiddhi do not go beyond these four, therefore the great master includes them with four.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a14_18']	論中天梵與真諦師天梵二住名義全同，而言定者，四等定也，此則以二攝於二也。	論中天梵與真諦師天梵二住名義全同，而言定者，四等定也，此則以二攝於二也。	In the treatise, the heavenly and brahma are completely the same in meaning as the two abodes of heavenly and brahma in the teachings of Satyasiddhi. As for concentration, it refers to the four equalities. This then includes two with two.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a16_9']	聖住，與真諦聖住名義全同，而更攝得五分壽命，此則以一攝二也。	聖住，與真諦聖住名義全同，而更攝得五分壽命，此則以一攝二也。	Holy abiding and abiding in true reality have the same meaning, but it also includes the five parts of lifespan, so it includes two with one.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a17_18']	佛住與真諦大處住名異義同，以一攝一，此則論四已攝彼五也。	佛住與真諦大處住名異義同，以一攝一，此則論四已攝彼五也。	Buddha's abiding and abiding in the great place of true reality have different names but the same meaning, including one with one. This means that the four in the treatise already include the five in the commentary.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a19_3']	而論復云「於四住法中住聖住、佛住法，憐憫眾生故。	而論復云「於四住法中住聖住、佛住法，憐憫眾生故。	The treatise also says, Among the four dharmas of abiding, abiding in the holy abode and the Buddha's abode is out of compassion for sentient beings.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a19_15']	」王舍城住，今云迹住也。	」王舍城住，今云迹住也。	The abode in Rājagṛha is now called the abode of traces.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a20_12']	此義復攝真諦三住，以王城是依止處故。	此義復攝真諦三住，以王城是依止處故。	This meaning also includes the three abodes in the commentary, because the royal city is the place of reliance.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a21_11']	王城在大千界內故，四威儀不離王城故。	王城在大千界內故，四威儀不離王城故。	Because the royal city is within the great trichiliocosm, and the four deportments are not apart from the royal city.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a21_13']	問：	問：	Question:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a22_13']	佛能住法是首楞嚴，論何須說聖、梵、天三？	佛能住法是首楞嚴，論何須說聖、梵、天三？	The dharma that the Buddha can abide in is the śūraṃgama samādhi. Why does the treatise also speak of the holy, brahma, and heavenly abodes?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a22_15']	答：	答：	Answer:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a23_11']	如來自行實在楞嚴，為利他故住餘三法。	如來自行實在楞嚴，為利他故住餘三法。	The Tathāgata's own practice truly resides in the śūraṃgama samādhi, but in order to benefit others he abides in the other three dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a24_10']	心若不住梵天等法，口豈能說四禪四等？	心若不住梵天等法，口豈能說四禪四等？	If the mind does not abide in the dharmas of Brahma Heaven and so forth, how can the mouth speak of the four dhyanas and four immeasurable minds?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a25_12']	是故妙樂明論四住云「從廣之狹、將勝攝劣故。	是故妙樂明論四住云「從廣之狹、將勝攝劣故。	Therefore, the Wondrous Joy Sutra clearly states the four abodes: From broad to narrow, taking the superior to include the inferior.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a26_13']	天攝機寬，佛攝最狹，中二迭論，故云從廣之狹。	天攝機寬，佛攝最狹，中二迭論，故云從廣之狹。	The heavens' scope of attracting beings is broad, while the Buddha's is the most narrow. Discussing the middle two alternately, it says 'from broad to narrow.'
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a27_16']	佛住既勝，無善不攝，故聖等三是凡小善，明所攝耳。	佛住既勝，無善不攝，故聖等三是凡小善，明所攝耳。	Since the Buddha's abode is superior, there is no goodness it does not include. Therefore, the holy, equal, and other three are merely the goodness of ordinary beings and lesser vehicles, which are clarified as what is included.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a28_3']	」二、今釋，二：	」二、今釋，二：	Second, the explanation, in two parts:
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a28_7']	初、教。	初、教。	First, the teachings.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088a29_16']	論明四住，其義猶總，是故今家明四教佛住於三諦，復論兼獨住法明矣。	論明四住，其義猶總，是故今家明四教佛住於三諦，復論兼獨住法明矣。	The treatise clarifies the four abodes, whose meaning is still general. Therefore, our school clarifies the four teachings' Buddhas abiding in the three truths, and further discusses the shared and exclusive abodes of the Dharma.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b01_19']	三藏所詮析法觀拙，故成佛唯丈六身，但住真諦。	三藏所詮析法觀拙，故成佛唯丈六身，但住真諦。	The subtle contemplation of analyzing dharmas expounded in the Tripiṭaka only results in the Buddha's form being only six feet tall, abiding only in the truth of suffering.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b04_16']	通教所詮體法觀巧，能證二空，故所成佛隨利鈍機一身兩見，丈六住真尊特住中、別教詮中修次第觀，故所成佛唯一尊特。	通教所詮體法觀巧，能證二空，故所成佛隨利鈍機一身兩見，丈六住真尊特住中、別教詮中修次第觀，故所成佛唯一尊特。	The common teaching explains the skillful contemplation of the essence of dharmas, which can realize the two emptinesses. Therefore, the Buddha accomplished according to the sharp and dull capacities of sentient beings, with one body appearing differently to each. The six-foot Buddha abides in truth, the majestic and special Buddha abides in the middle. The separate teaching explains the gradual contemplation of the middle way, therefore the Buddha accomplished is only the majestic and special Buddha.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b05_15']	以須別修緣了莊嚴，故使此佛雙住俗中。	以須別修緣了莊嚴，故使此佛雙住俗中。	Because it is necessary to separately cultivate the conditions and antidotes to adorn, this causes this Buddha to abide in the middle of the conventional.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b07_19']	圓教詮中，中具諸法，因中萬行不修而修、果上萬德成無所成，故即報應名為法身，唯住中道。	圓教詮中，中具諸法，因中萬行不修而修、果上萬德成無所成，故即報應名為法身，唯住中道。	The perfect teaching explains the middle way, which is endowed with all dharmas. In the cause, the myriad practices are cultivated without cultivation, and in the fruition, the myriad virtues are accomplished without accomplishment. Therefore, the reward and response bodies are called the Dharma body, and only abide in the middle way.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b08_8']	前三教佛豈離法身？	前三教佛豈離法身？	How could the Buddhas of the previous three teachings be apart from the Dharma body?
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b09_11']	今就當分，明四差別，是故四佛各以住法住於城山。	今就當分，明四差別，是故四佛各以住法住於城山。	Now, according to their respective divisions, the four distinctions are clarified. Therefore, the four Buddhas each abide in the Dharma they abide in, in the city and on the mountain.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b09_15']	二、觀。	二、觀。	Second, contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1786_01a:0088b10_18']	於一心中圓修三觀、住於三諦，以此住法住所居處。	於一心中圓修三觀、住於三諦，以此住法住所居處。	In a single thought, one fully cultivates the three contemplations and abides in the three truths. This abiding Dharma abides in the place one dwells.
