These three dharmas are neither sequential nor simultaneous, neither parallel nor separate, and form the secret treasury.

The true aspect is the Dharma body, as the chapter on the adamantine body in the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra clarifies.

It is like a person with eyes, illuminated by the light of the sun, seeing various colors. This is the cause. All characteristics are non-characteristics. This is the effect. This cause and effect are the same in terms of the true aspect.

All kinds of fixation are called attachments. Breaking through the afflictions of various characteristics reveals its power. It is also unobstructed itself, which is its power and function.

['ZH_T33_1698_001:0075a27_17']	次廣解釋，言《金剛般若》，此乃摧萬有於性空，蕩一無於畢竟，甚堅甚銳名曰金剛。	次廣解釋，言《金剛般若》，此乃摧萬有於性空，蕩一無於畢竟，甚堅甚銳名曰金剛。	Next, it extensively explains the Vajra Prajñāpāramitā. This is the destruction of myriad existences in nature emptiness, the emptying of even the slightest in the ultimate, called the vajra because it is extremely firm and sharp.
['ZH_T33_1698_001:0075a29_12']	智名決斷，慧曰解知，萬像雖繁，物我無相，有為斯絕，寂其機照，故假名般若。	智名決斷，慧曰解知，萬像雖繁，物我無相，有為斯絕，寂其機照，故假名般若。	Wisdom is called decisive, and discernment is called understanding. Although myriad forms are abundant, there is no distinction between things and self. Existence is cut off here, and its functioning is tranquil. Therefore, it is provisionally named prajñā.

This is neither solid nor sharp, what is meant by solid and sharp?

['ZH_T33_1698_001:0075b13_7']	此一例語，任運不畏斯難，般若如大火聚，四邊不可觸，豈可定作體用耶？	此一例語，任運不畏斯難，般若如大火聚，四邊不可觸，豈可定作體用耶？	This is a single example, effortlessly not fearing this difficulty. Prajñā is like a great mass of fire, the four sides cannot be touched, how can it be definitely made into essence and function?
['ZH_T33_1698_001:0075b14_19']	體用因緣不一不異，體堅用亦堅，體利用亦利，既其不一，假名義辨。	體用因緣不一不異，體堅用亦堅，體利用亦利，既其不一，假名義辨。	Essence and function are neither the same nor different. The essence is solid and the function is also solid. The essence is useful and the function is also sharp. Since they are not the same, they are provisionally named and explained.
['ZH_T33_1698_001:0075b21_19']	若說體堅即說用利，此是假名義一邊之說，離用無體、離體無用，用即寂、寂即用，無別有無用之體主於用也，亦無別有無體之用主於體也，不一亦不異，有因緣故亦可說一說異，為破一說異、破異說一，假說一異，令眾生悟非一非異，秖名此因緣不一不異，離斷常戲論，戲論不得入即是堅，能破斷常即是利也。	若說體堅即說用利，此是假名義一邊之說，離用無體、離體無用，用即寂、寂即用，無別有無用之體主於用也，亦無別有無體之用主於體也，不一亦不異，有因緣故亦可說一說異，為破一說異、破異說一，假說一異，令眾生悟非一非異，秖名此因緣不一不異，離斷常戲論，戲論不得入即是堅，能破斷常即是利也。	If one speaks of the essence as solid, one speaks of the function as sharp. This is a one-sided statement of provisional meaning. Apart from the function there is no essence, apart from the essence there is no function. The function is precisely quiescence, quiescence is precisely the function. There is no separate essence that is not a function, nor is there a separate function that is not an essence. It is neither the same nor different. Because there are causes and conditions, one can also speak of sameness and difference. In order to refute sameness and difference, and to refute difference and sameness, provisional sameness and difference are spoken of, causing sentient beings to realize that it is neither the same nor different. This cause and condition is precisely called neither the same nor different, apart from the disputes of annihilation and permanence. The disputes cannot enter, which is precisely solidity. Being able to break through annihilation and permanence is precisely sharpness.

In explaining the phrase 'inconceivable,' it says that 'inconceivable' refers to wisdom. This is measuring the perfection of giving, which cannot be measured without wisdom. Therefore, it is called 'inconceivable wisdom,' which is the true aspect of prajñā-pāramitā.

The wisdom of bodhisattvas in the causal stage cannot measure the prajñā of the Buddha's fruition ground. This is because the wisdom of the causal stage is shallow and cannot measure the prajñā of the fruition ground. How can one mistakenly cite the untranslatable [Sanskrit] terms?
