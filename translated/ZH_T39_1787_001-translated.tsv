The supreme person transcends thought, yet responds when there is a connection. The great expedient means adapts to the capacities of beings and preaches accordingly. Therefore, the four buddhas manifest in the room and proclaim the purport of permanence. Bodhisattvas are moved to dream and speak the method of repentance. This also includes the two wholesome dharmas and encompasses the myriad practices. The fruition is to ascend to spiritual enlightenment with a lifespan equal to empty space.

The four heavenly kings praise the merit of protecting the sūtra. Relying on the sūtra to expound and speak, obstacles and difficulties dissipate. Relying on the Dharma to make wishes, blessings and joy follow the mind. Therefore, this sūtra takes the middle way of the true Dharma as its essence, and the three dots and four virtues as its main point.
