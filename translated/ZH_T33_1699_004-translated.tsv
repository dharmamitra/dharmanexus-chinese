['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b09_12']	前於《大品》中雖善吉已悟，而中下根人未悟，今同其未悟，故云未曾得聞；	前於《大品》中雖善吉已悟，而中下根人未悟，今同其未悟，故云未曾得聞；	Although Subhūti had already realized it in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, those of middling and lower faculties had not yet realized it. Now, he shares in their non-realization, so he says he has never heard it before;
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b10_15']	中下根人於今得悟，故同其得悟，故言今始得聞耳。	中下根人於今得悟，故同其得悟，故言今始得聞耳。	Those of middling and lower faculties will realize it now, so he shares in their realization, thus he says he has only now begun to hear it.

Therefore, the teacher and disciple alternate in encouraging faith and realization.

['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b15_17']	「則生實相」者，他云世諦生、真諦不生，即問：	「則生實相」者，他云世諦生、真諦不生，即問：	Will give rise to the true appearance - others say that it arises in conventional truth but does not arise in true reality, so they ask:
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b16_14']	實相即是真諦，既生實相，何不生真諦耶？	實相即是真諦，既生實相，何不生真諦耶？	The true aspect is precisely true suchness. Since the true aspect is born, why is true suchness not born?
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b16_18']	彼釋云：	彼釋云：	Their explanation says:
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b17_4']	生實相之慧耳。	生實相之慧耳。	It is merely the wisdom that gives rise to the true aspect.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b18_16']	實相不可生，但慧從境作名，稱為實慧，境從慧作名，故生慧言生境耳。	實相不可生，但慧從境作名，稱為實慧，境從慧作名，故生慧言生境耳。	The true aspect cannot be born. But wisdom takes its name from the object, and is called true wisdom. The object takes its name from the wisdom, and therefore the phrase giving rise to wisdom means giving rise to the object.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b19_16']	今明二諦俱生不生，如義中釋，斯文即證也。	今明二諦俱生不生，如義中釋，斯文即證也。	Now, it is explained that the two truths are both born and unborn. As explained in the meaning, this text is the evidence.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b21_17']	但一師有觀發中、中發觀義，此明生實相即是觀發中，正觀明了則實相現前，故名生實相。	但一師有觀發中、中發觀義，此明生實相即是觀發中，正觀明了則實相現前，故名生實相。	But one master has the meaning of contemplation giving rise to the middle, and the middle giving rise to contemplation. This clarifies that giving rise to the true aspect is precisely contemplation giving rise to the middle. When right contemplation is clear, the true aspect appears, and therefore it is called giving rise to the true aspect.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b23_7']	此約迷悟為論，於迷者不現前名實相不生，悟者現前名為生實相。	此約迷悟為論，於迷者不現前名實相不生，悟者現前名為生實相。	This is discussed in terms of delusion and enlightenment. For the deluded one, it does not appear and is called the true aspect not being born. For the enlightened one, it appears and is called giving rise to the true aspect.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b24_12']	令生實相既爾，佛性等例然，至論實相未曾生不生也。	令生實相既爾，佛性等例然，至論實相未曾生不生也。	Giving rise to the true aspect is like this. Buddha-nature and so forth are the same. In reality, the true aspect has never been born or unborn.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b27_7']	「是實相者則非實相」者，他還以二諦釋此文如常彈，今依論釋簡成實相義，「是實相」者，獨佛法大乘有此實相，故云實相。	「是實相者則非實相」者，他還以二諦釋此文如常彈，今依論釋簡成實相義，「是實相」者，獨佛法大乘有此實相，故云實相。	This true reality is not true reality - others still use the two truths to explain this passage as usual, now relying on the treatise to explain and distinguish the meaning of true reality. This true reality refers to the true reality that exists only in the Buddha's teachings and the Mahayana, hence it is called true reality.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b28_7']	「即非實相」者，天魔外道無實相，故言非實相。	「即非實相」者，天魔外道無實相，故言非實相。	It is not true reality means that non-Buddhists and non-Mahāyānists do not have true reality, hence it is said to be not true reality.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114b29_18']	「是名實相」者，論經長有一句云「實相實相」，此句簡二乘實相有二種：	「是名實相」者，論經長有一句云「實相實相」，此句簡二乘實相有二種：	This is called true reality - the treatise's version of the sūtra has an extra sentence saying true reality, true reality. This sentence distinguishes the two types of true reality of the two vehicles:
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c01_3']	一、大乘實相；	一、大乘實相；	1. The true reality of the Mahayana;
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c01_10']	二、小乘實相。	二、小乘實相。	2. The true reality of the Hinayana.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c02_10']	今明是大乘實相、非二乘實相，故云實相實相。	今明是大乘實相、非二乘實相，故云實相實相。	Now it is clarified that it is the true reality of the Mahayana, not the true reality of the two vehicles, hence it is said true reality, true reality.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c03_4']	前句簡外實相，此句簡內實相。	前句簡外實相，此句簡內實相。	The previous sentence distinguishes the true reality of non-Buddhists, this sentence distinguishes the true reality of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c04_17']	所以二簡者，以獨佛法有實相，及獨大乘有實相生實相之慧，方是希有耳。	所以二簡者，以獨佛法有實相，及獨大乘有實相生實相之慧，方是希有耳。	The reason for the two distinctions is that only the Buddha's teachings have the true nature, and only the Mahayana has the wisdom that gives rise to the true nature of the true nature, which is truly rare.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c05_16']	「世尊我今得聞」下，第三、述自悟為易。	「世尊我今得聞」下，第三、述自悟為易。	World-Honored One, I now have been able to hear - third, describing one's own realization as easy.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c05_21']	所以易者：	所以易者：	The reason it is easy is:
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c06_10']	一者、明過去久殖三多；	一者、明過去久殖三多；	First, it clarifies planting the three muchnesses in the past;
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c07_12']	二者、現在者值佛，內因外緣具足，故信受為易也。	二者、現在者值佛，內因外緣具足，故信受為易也。	Second, in the present one encounters the Buddha, with both internal causes and external conditions complete, so it is easy to have faith and acceptance.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c09_3']	又就迹中為論，須菩提是大阿羅漢，如《大品》云「般若甚深，誰能信解？	又就迹中為論，須菩提是大阿羅漢，如《大品》云「般若甚深，誰能信解？	Moreover, discussing it in terms of the traces, Subhūti is a great arhat, as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says, Prajñā is profound, who can believe and understand it?
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c09_6']	答云：	答云：	The answer says:
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c09_20']	正見成就人，漏盡阿羅漢能信。	正見成就人，漏盡阿羅漢能信。	One who has accomplished right views, an arhat whose defilements are exhausted, can have faith.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c10_16']	」今須菩提既是羅漢，所以信解不難也。	」今須菩提既是羅漢，所以信解不難也。	Now that Subhūti is an arhat, the reason he has faith and understanding is not difficult.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c12_12']	若就本為論，須菩提內祕菩薩行，或可是往古如來示同眾迷，所以悟解為易。	若就本為論，須菩提內祕菩薩行，或可是往古如來示同眾迷，所以悟解為易。	If we discuss it from the basis, Subhūti secretly practices bodhisattva conduct, and may be the ancient Tathāgata manifesting as confused with the masses, so his realization and understanding is easy.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c13_7']	「若當來世」下，第四、陳他悟為難。	「若當來世」下，第四、陳他悟為難。	If in the future... is the fourth, stating that others' realization is difficult.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c14_5']	所以難者，良由生在末世後五百歲故也。	所以難者，良由生在末世後五百歲故也。	The reason it is difficult is precisely because one is born in the latter five hundred years of the Dharma-ending age.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c14_10']	叡法師云：	叡法師云：	Master Rui said:

['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c17_10']	後五百歲不信者多、信者為少。	後五百歲不信者多、信者為少。	in the latter five hundred years, those who do not believe are many, while those who believe are few.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c18_9']	是以前五百年名正法，後五百年名像法。	是以前五百年名正法，後五百年名像法。	Therefore, the first five hundred years is called the True Dharma, and the latter five hundred years is called the Semblance Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c19_2']	」能於像法中信，所以為難也。	」能於像法中信，所以為難也。	Being able to believe in the Semblance Dharma is why it is difficult.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c20_16']	又明此時眾生不久殖三多、不久值佛，無內因外緣，能於中生信，是故為難。	又明此時眾生不久殖三多、不久值佛，無內因外緣，能於中生信，是故為難。	Moreover, it clarifies that at this time sentient beings will not have cultivated the three muchnesses for a long time, will not have encountered the Buddha for a long time, and will not have internal causes and external conditions, able to give rise to faith within this, therefore it is difficult.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c21_9']	「何以故」下，此釋信為難意也。	「何以故」下，此釋信為難意也。	Why is it so? below, this explains the meaning of faith being difficult.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c23_1']	若言有人能信、般若所信，則是人法之見，不名為信也，此信亦不難也。	若言有人能信、般若所信，則是人法之見，不名為信也，此信亦不難也。	If it is said that there are people who can have faith and what prajñā believes, then this is the view of person and dharmas, and it cannot be called faith, and this faith is also not difficult.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c24_2']	明若不見我是能信，即是人空，即是無有人見；	明若不見我是能信，即是人空，即是無有人見；	It is clarified that if one does not see that I am the one who has faith, then this is the emptiness of person, and this is the absence of the view of a person;
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0114c25_1']	不見般若是所信，即是法空，即是無法見。	不見般若是所信，即是法空，即是無法見。	Not seeing that prajñā is what is believed, this is the emptiness of dharmas, and this is the absence of the view of dharmas.

['ZH_T33_1699_004:0115a01_7']	又道理若實有我人之相則不可離，以道理實無我人之相，但眾生妄謂為有，故我相可離多，故云我相即是非相也。	又道理若實有我人之相則不可離，以道理實無我人之相，但眾生妄謂為有，故我相可離多，故云我相即是非相也。	Moreover, if the characteristics of self and person truly exist, they cannot be separated. Since the characteristics of self and person are actually non-existent, but beings mistakenly think they exist, therefore the characteristics of self can be separated. Since there are many, it is said that the characteristics of self are not characteristics.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0115a03_5']	《大品》云「眾生所著，若有一毫末之可有，則不可離，以所著處無如毛髮許有可離也。	《大品》云「眾生所著，若有一毫末之可有，則不可離，以所著處無如毛髮許有可離也。	The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says: If there were even a speck of dust's worth of attachment in beings, then it could not be separated. Since there is not even a hair's breadth of attachment that can be separated in the place of attachment.

['ZH_T33_1699_004:0115a05_4']	如所謂陽炎是無，能謂之心是有。	如所謂陽炎是無，能謂之心是有。	It is like the so-called mirage being non-existent, but the mind that can be called existent is existent.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0115a05_18']	今明能謂之心，如所謂不異也。	今明能謂之心，如所謂不異也。	Now, it is explained that the mind that can be called is no different from the so-called.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0115a06_12']	若依論釋者，此明人、法兩空。	若依論釋者，此明人、法兩空。	If we rely on the commentary, this clarifies the emptiness of both person and dharmas.

Now it reiterates the reason for believing the Buddha's words, because the Buddha's words are not false.🔽True words means speaking in accordance with ultimate truth.

['ZH_T33_1699_004:0116b09_10']	初引如來說一切相則非相，說一切眾生則非眾生，此勸菩薩捨人法見，令信無所住教。	初引如來說一切相則非相，說一切眾生則非眾生，此勸菩薩捨人法見，令信無所住教。	First, citing the Tathāgata's statement that all characteristics are not characteristics, and that all sentient beings are not sentient beings, this encourages bodhisattvas to abandon views of persons and phenomena, and to believe in the teaching of non-abiding.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0116b10_13']	次引五語證佛語不虛，勸菩薩信佛說無所住教也。	次引五語證佛語不虛，勸菩薩信佛說無所住教也。	Next, citing the five statements to prove that the Buddha's words are not false, this encourages bodhisattvas to believe in the Buddha's teaching of non-abiding.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0116b12_18']	今第三引佛所證得法，復勸信無所住教，以佛親依無所住教證得菩提，故菩薩須信無所住教門也。	今第三引佛所證得法，復勸信無所住教，以佛親依無所住教證得菩提，故菩薩須信無所住教門也。	Now, third, citing the Dharma that was realized by the Buddha, it again encourages belief in the teaching of non-abiding, because the Buddha personally relied on the teaching of non-abiding to realize enlightenment, so bodhisattvas must believe in the teaching of non-abiding.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0116b14_11']	論經長有一句，謂「如來所得法，如來所說法」，如來所得法，釋已如向也。	論經長有一句，謂「如來所得法，如來所說法」，如來所得法，釋已如向也。	The sutra has one sentence, namely the Dharma that the Tathagata has attained, the Dharma that the Tathagata has spoken. The Dharma that the Tathagata has attained has been explained above.

The correct path transcends words, if one clings to the words then one loses the path, therefore the words are not real. It is not that the path is not indicated through words, therefore the words are not false. The analogy of pointing at the moon is precisely this matter.

Above, it only clarifies that the treasures of the trichiliocosm are not as good as upholding the four lines of the sutra. Now, it clarifies that even a hundredth part is not as good as one.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0121c18_5']	依論，經有四種勝：	依論，經有四種勝：	According to the treatise, the sutra has four kinds of superiority:
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0121c19_17']	一者云百分不及一乃至百千分不及一，此是數勝，持經福不可數也。	一者云百分不及一乃至百千分不及一，此是數勝，持經福不可數也。	First, it says that a hundredth part is not as good as one, up to a hundred thousandth part is not as good as one. This is the superiority in number. The merit of upholding the sutra cannot be counted.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0121c21_4']	二者、歌羅分不及一，此是力用勝，明經力用勝七寶施力用；	二者、歌羅分不及一，此是力用勝，明經力用勝七寶施力用；	Second, a kalā is not as good as one. This is the superiority in power and function. It clarifies that the power and function of the sutra surpasses the power and function of giving the seven treasures;
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0121c23_18']	三者、優婆尼沙陀分不及一，此云不相似數勝，此是數中微細之數，乃至持經少許福德數，無有與此數相似，故云數勝。	三者、優婆尼沙陀分不及一，此云不相似數勝，此是數中微細之數，乃至持經少許福德數，無有與此數相似，故云數勝。	Third, it is not equal to a fraction of the number of upaniṣad divisions, which means it is not similar to the number of upaniṣads. This is the most subtle number among numbers, up to the number of blessings and virtues from upholding even a small part of the sūtra, which is not similar to this number, thus it is called the number of upaniṣads.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0121c24_15']	四者、因果勝，此經因果勝餘因果也。	四者、因果勝，此經因果勝餘因果也。	Fourth, it is the supremacy of cause and effect, which means this sūtra's cause and effect are superior to other causes and effects.

The treatise says: From the above, enlightenment has no high or low. If there is no high, then buddhas are not high. The Buddha is not the one who crosses over.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0121c27_13']	若無有下，則眾生非下，不下度眾生。	若無有下，則眾生非下，不下度眾生。	If there is no low, then sentient beings are not low. The Buddha does not cross over sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0121c29_2']	而佛是能度故佛為高，眾生是所度故眾生為下，不應無高下也。	而佛是能度故佛為高，眾生是所度故眾生為下，不應無高下也。	Because the Buddha is the one who crosses over, the Buddha is high. Because sentient beings are the ones who are crossed over, sentient beings are low. It should not be that there is no high or low.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0122a02_3']	」又從上為他說四句生者，時會既聞為他說四句功德無邊，便謂有眾生可為，故今破之也。	」又從上為他說四句生者，時會既聞為他說四句功德無邊，便謂有眾生可為，故今破之也。	Moreover, the four phrases arising from speaking for others above means that when the assembly heard that the merit of speaking the four phrases for others is boundless, they considered that there are sentient beings to be spoken for, so now it is refuted.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0122a04_1']	前文止於疑念，次「何以故」，釋止疑念所以，明實無眾生可度，汝不應念佛度眾生也。	前文止於疑念，次「何以故」，釋止疑念所以，明實無眾生可度，汝不應念佛度眾生也。	The previous text only stops at doubt and thought, next why is it so explains the reason for stopping doubt and thought, clarifying that there are truly no sentient beings to be liberated, and you should not think that the Buddha liberates sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0122a05_12']	「若有眾生如來度者」，此是反釋，若見有眾生可度，佛則有取我之過也。	「若有眾生如來度者」，此是反釋，若見有眾生可度，佛則有取我之過也。	If there were sentient beings that the Tathāgata liberated, this is a reverse explanation, if one sees there are sentient beings to be liberated, then the Buddha would have the fault of grasping at a self.
['ZH_T33_1699_004:0122a06_16']	以眾生見眾生、眾生名眾生，不能自度，何能度眾生？	以眾生見眾生、眾生名眾生，不能自度，何能度眾生？	Because sentient beings see sentient beings, and the name sentient beings cannot liberate themselves, how can they liberate sentient beings?
