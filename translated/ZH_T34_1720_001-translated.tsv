Moreover, Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in a thousand worlds of the lower direction emerge from the ground and fill the space in the ten directions.

As stated in the beginning of the chapter on Distinguishing Merits, there are twelve kinds of benefits, starting from immeasurable Ganges-river-sands of bodhisattvas realizing the forbearance of the non-arising of dharmas, and ending with sentient beings equal to the dust motes in eight buddha-realms giving rise to the bodhi mind.

For example, the person who hears the sūtra from the fiftieth person and joyfully follows it for a single thought surpasses the merit of giving all kinds of pleasures to the sentient beings of the six destinies in four hundred and ten thousand koṭīs of nayutas of asamkhyeyas of worlds and enabling them to attain the path of arhatship. How much more so for the immeasurable merit of upholding, reciting, and understanding liberation, therefore the merits are inconceivable.

['ZH_T34_1720_001:0365a22_15']	餘教不明此經獨有，謂身不思議也。	餘教不明此經獨有，謂身不思議也。	Other teachings do not clarify this, but this sutra alone has it, saying that the body is inconceivable.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0365a24_10']	以有如是十種難思事，持說之人累滅於內、瑞獲于外，僧弼廣載豈徒然哉。	以有如是十種難思事，持說之人累滅於內、瑞獲于外，僧弼廣載豈徒然哉。	Because there are these ten kinds of difficult-to-conceive matters, the person who upholds and recites it destroys karmic hindrances within and obtains auspicious benefits without.

['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b15_11']	初釋〈方便品〉「唯佛與佛究竟諸法實相」，諸法實相者，謂如來藏法身之體不變，故佛性亦名如來藏，故云隱名如來藏、顯名為法身。	初釋〈方便品〉「唯佛與佛究竟諸法實相」，諸法實相者，謂如來藏法身之體不變，故佛性亦名如來藏，故云隱名如來藏、顯名為法身。	First, explaining the Skillful Means Chapter: Only the Buddhas and Buddhas ultimately understand the true characteristics of all dharmas. The true characteristics of all dharmas refer to the unchanging essence of the Tathagata's womb and Dharma body. Therefore, Buddha-nature is also called the Tathagata's womb. Therefore, it is said that when it is hidden, it is called the Tathagata's womb, and when it is revealed, it is called the Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b16_5']	《大經》云「我者即是如來藏義」。	《大經》云「我者即是如來藏義」。	The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: The self is the meaning of the Tathāgata's womb.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b17_10']	次第二文釋〈法師品〉云「知佛性水不違，得成三菩提」。	次第二文釋〈法師品〉云「知佛性水不違，得成三菩提」。	The second text explains the Dharma Teacher Chapter and says: Knowing that the water of Buddha-nature is unobstructed, one can attain the three kinds of enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b17_18']	此序方便品意竟。	此序方便品意竟。	This concludes the meaning of the Skillful Means Chapter.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b18_6']	復次欲結束融會。	復次欲結束融會。	Next, I will summarize and integrate.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b19_17']	釋迦一化始終凡有七門，今三乘人未得悟者皆得領解，故說是經。	釋迦一化始終凡有七門，今三乘人未得悟者皆得領解，故說是經。	From beginning to end, Śākyamuni's teachings have seven aspects. Now, those of the three vehicles who have not yet attained enlightenment will all be able to understand, so this sūtra is taught.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b21_4']	一者序歎中道法身門，謂如來法身無一切累、具一切德。	一者序歎中道法身門，謂如來法身無一切累、具一切德。	First, the chapter on praising the middle way and Dharma body, which refers to the Tathāgata's Dharma body being free from all afflictions and possessing all virtues.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b21_14']	無一切累，不可為有；	無一切累，不可為有；	Without any afflictions, it cannot be said to exist;
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b22_15']	具一切德，不可為無，非有非無即是中道法身。	具一切德，不可為無，非有非無即是中道法身。	Endowed with all virtues, it cannot be said to be nonexistent. Neither existent nor nonexistent, it is precisely the middle way and Dharma body.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b24_11']	是故經云「如來於諸怖畏衰惱憂患無明闇弊永盡無餘」，此謂無一切累也；	是故經云「如來於諸怖畏衰惱憂患無明闇弊永盡無餘」，此謂無一切累也；	Therefore, the sūtra says, The Tathāgata has completely eliminated without remainder all fear, decline, suffering, and the darkness of ignorance, referring to the absence of all afflictions;
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b25_12']	「而悉成就無量知見力無所畏等」，此具一切德。	「而悉成就無量知見力無所畏等」，此具一切德。	And has fully accomplished immeasurable knowledge and insight, powers, fearlessness, and so forth, referring to the endowment with all virtues.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b26_18']	所以明此二者，良以無患故能救物患，有一切德故濟物無德。	所以明此二者，良以無患故能救物患，有一切德故濟物無德。	The reason for clarifying these two is precisely because of being free from suffering, one is able to save others from suffering, and because of possessing all virtues, one is able to benefit others who lack virtues.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b27_13']	是以將明起化，故前歎化本也。	是以將明起化，故前歎化本也。	Therefore, in order to clarify the arising of transformation, the basis of transformation is first praised.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367b28_16']	二者大悲門，謂如來在法身地，見二種眾生起大悲心：	二者大悲門，謂如來在法身地，見二種眾生起大悲心：	Second, the gate of great compassion refers to the Tathāgata, while dwelling in the stage of the Dharma body, seeing two kinds of sentient beings and giving rise to a mind of great compassion:
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c01_3']	一者昔曾受佛化而先觀招苦，二者未經高道受三界煮燒。	一者昔曾受佛化而先觀招苦，二者未經高道受三界煮燒。	First, those who have previously received the Buddha's transformation but are now seen to be undergoing suffering; second, those who have not yet experienced the lofty path and are being boiled and burned in the three realms.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c02_18']	此二眾生具一切患、無一切德，故有佛所無、無佛所有，為此眾生起大悲心也。	此二眾生具一切患、無一切德，故有佛所無、無佛所有，為此眾生起大悲心也。	These two kinds of beings are endowed with all afflictions and lack all virtues, so they have what those with Buddhas lack and lack what those with Buddhas have. For these beings, one gives rise to the mind of great compassion.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c04_5']	三者垂應門，既起大悲心，故應入生死，為度物起八相成道。	三者垂應門，既起大悲心，故應入生死，為度物起八相成道。	Third, the gate of responding. Since one has given rise to the mind of great compassion, one should enter saṃsāra and, in order to deliver beings, manifest the eight aspects of the path to enlightenment.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c05_4']	是故經云「而生三界朽故火宅」，即其事也。	是故經云「而生三界朽故火宅」，即其事也。	Therefore, the sūtra says, And are born in the decaying and decrepit burning house of the three realms. This is the matter.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c07_6']	四者實化不得門，既起大悲心為物成道，而初成道時即欲以大悲拔其有累、大慈濟其無德。	四者實化不得門，既起大悲心為物成道，而初成道時即欲以大悲拔其有累、大慈濟其無德。	Fourth, the gate of not being able to deliver through reality. Having already given rise to the mind of great compassion and attained the path for the sake of beings, when one first attains the path, one immediately wishes to use great compassion to eliminate their entanglements and use great kindness to benefit their lack of virtue.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c08_5']	但聖雖能授，而凡不能受，故息於實化也。	但聖雖能授，而凡不能受，故息於實化也。	However, although the sages are able to bestow, the ordinary beings are unable to receive, and thus they cease the real teaching.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c10_5']	五者權化得門，雖一乘化之不從，而大悲不捨，欲漸引諸子，故於一說三，謂權誘門也。	五者權化得門，雖一乘化之不從，而大悲不捨，欲漸引諸子，故於一說三，謂權誘門也。	Fifth, the gate of being able to deliver through skillful means. Although the teaching of the One Vehicle is not accepted, great compassion does not abandon them. Wishing to gradually lead the children, they teach the three vehicles within the One Vehicle. This is the gate of skillful guidance.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c11_15']	六者實化得門，小執將傾、大機欲動，故會三歸一，謂實化得門也。	六者實化得門，小執將傾、大機欲動，故會三歸一，謂實化得門也。	Sixth is the gate of attaining the real transformation, where small attachments are about to collapse and the great capacity is about to move, thus reconciling the three into one, which is called the gate of attaining the real transformation.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c13_7']	七者不虛門，許三與一似若相乖，以深見物機故無虛妄，謂不虛門也。	七者不虛門，許三與一似若相乖，以深見物機故無虛妄，謂不虛門也。	Seventh is the gate of non-falseness, where the promise of three and the bestowal of one seem to contradict each other, but there is no falsehood because of deeply seeing the capacity of beings, which is called the gate of non-falseness.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c13_16']	束此七義可為六雙：	束此七義可為六雙：	These seven meanings can be summarized into six pairs:
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c14_14']	初一是自門、後六化他門，自他一雙也。	初一是自門、後六化他門，自他一雙也。	The first is the gate of self, and the latter six are the gate of transforming others. This is the first pair of self and others.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c15_11']	前二是法身、後五為應迹，本迹一雙也。	前二是法身、後五為應迹，本迹一雙也。	The first two are the Dharma body, and the latter five are the response traces. This is the second pair of the fundamental and traces.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c17_7']	復五之中，初一節非但釋迦具斯七事，亦是舍那化即是釋迦化，二佛一雙也。	復五之中，初一節非但釋迦具斯七事，亦是舍那化即是釋迦化，二佛一雙也。	Furthermore, among the five, the first not only explains that Śākyamuni is endowed with these seven things, but also that the transformation of Mahāvairocana is precisely the transformation of Śākyamuni. This is the third pair of the two buddhas.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c18_12']	復四之中，初一頓化不得、後三漸化得子，謂頓漸一雙也。	復四之中，初一頓化不得、後三漸化得子，謂頓漸一雙也。	Furthermore, among the four, the first is the failure of sudden transformation, and the latter three are the gradual transformation of attaining the disciples. This is the fourth pair of sudden and gradual.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c19_13']	後三之中，初一說三、後二明一，三一一雙也。	後三之中，初一說三、後二明一，三一一雙也。	Among the latter three, the first explains the three, and the latter two clarify the one. This is the fifth pair of the three and the one.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c21_10']	後二之中，初正明一、次融會，一切諸佛教皆同然三一不虛，謂教及會教一雙也。	後二之中，初正明一、次融會，一切諸佛教皆同然三一不虛，謂教及會教一雙也。	Among the latter two, the first correctly clarifies the one, and the next integrates and harmonizes. All Buddhist teachings are the same. The one and three are not false, referring to the pair of teachings and harmonized teachings.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c22_4']	此釋〈譬喻〉意果〈方便品〉末也。	此釋〈譬喻〉意果〈方便品〉末也。	This explains the meaning of the Parable Chapter, which ends with the chapter on skillful means.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c22_15']	復次欲說如來十種大恩。	復次欲說如來十種大恩。	Next, I wish to explain the Tathāgata's ten kinds of great kindness.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c24_1']	今已悟之人心得堅明，未解之者因此改執，故說此經也。	今已悟之人心得堅明，未解之者因此改執，故說此經也。	Now, those who have already awakened have a firm and bright mind, and those who have not yet understood will change their attachments based on this, and thus this sūtra is spoken.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c26_3']	一者釋迦過去初發心時，結四弘誓願欲普濟六道，法華之緣已入斯願，是為第一通弘誓恩。	一者釋迦過去初發心時，結四弘誓願欲普濟六道，法華之緣已入斯願，是為第一通弘誓恩。	First, when Śākyamuni first gave rise to the aspiration in the past, he made the four great vows and wished to universally deliver the six destinies. The conditions for the Lotus Sūtra were already included in this vow, which is the first general vow of great kindness.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0367c27_18']	二者過去世時曾為此緣已說大法，而此眾生曾高大化，是為第二別結緣恩也。	二者過去世時曾為此緣已說大法，而此眾生曾高大化，是為第二別結緣恩也。	Second, in the past lives, he had already expounded the great Dharma for the sake of these conditions, and these sentient beings had already received the great transformation. This is the second specific vow of kindness.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a01_3']	三者此無量眾生罪重鈍根，背化起惑流浪六趣，菩薩隨入生死方便誘化，乃至今種五乘種子。	三者此無量眾生罪重鈍根，背化起惑流浪六趣，菩薩隨入生死方便誘化，乃至今種五乘種子。	Third, these immeasurable sentient beings have heavy offenses and dull faculties, turn their backs on transformation, give rise to afflictions, and wander in the six destinies. Bodhisattvas follow them into birth and death, skillfully guiding and transforming them, and now plant the seeds of the five vehicles.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a02_16']	自從背化已後、訖未成道之前，經無數劫隨逐化之，是為第三隨逐化恩。	自從背化已後、訖未成道之前，經無數劫隨逐化之，是為第三隨逐化恩。	From the time of turning their backs on transformation until before they attain the Way, they pass through countless kalpas following and transforming them. This is the third kindness of following and transforming.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a04_4']	四者釋迦雖久已成佛，為此眾生大機將熟起故更示成道。	四者釋迦雖久已成佛，為此眾生大機將熟起故更示成道。	Fourth, although Śākyamuni had long since attained Buddhahood, he manifested becoming a Buddha again because the great capacity of these sentient beings was about to mature.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a05_13']	是故經云「中止一城乃至脫珍御服著垢膩衣」，謂隱本示迹恩。	是故經云「中止一城乃至脫珍御服著垢膩衣」，謂隱本示迹恩。	Therefore the sūtra says, Stopping in a city... taking off precious garments and wearing soiled clothes, referring to the kindness of concealing the original and manifesting the trace.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a09_2']	五者初成道時種種思惟方便救濟，或欲現通、或欲說法、或勸或誡同入一乘，但佛慧甚深、眾生根鈍，雖有欲化之功而無從救之理，是為第五思濟恩。	五者初成道時種種思惟方便救濟，或欲現通、或欲說法、或勸或誡同入一乘，但佛慧甚深、眾生根鈍，雖有欲化之功而無從救之理，是為第五思濟恩。	Fifth, when first attaining the Way, he contemplated various skillful means to save and deliver. Either wanting to manifest spiritual powers, or wanting to expound the Dharma, either encouraging or admonishing to enter the One Vehicle together, but the Buddha's wisdom is extremely profound and sentient beings' faculties are dull. Although there is the merit of wanting to transform them, there is no principle of being able to save them. This is the fifth kindness of contemplating and delivering.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a10_18']	六者子雖捨父，父不捨子，故隱窮深佛慧至道而開極淺人天之樂，謂隱深說淺恩。	六者子雖捨父，父不捨子，故隱窮深佛慧至道而開極淺人天之樂，謂隱深說淺恩。	Sixth, although the child abandons the father, the father does not abandon the child. Therefore, he hides the profound wisdom and ultimate way of the Buddha and reveals the most shallow pleasures of humans and gods. This is called the kindness of hiding the profound and speaking of the shallow.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a12_8']	故文云「冷水灑面令得醒悟」，謂成道已後鹿苑之前說人天教也。	故文云「冷水灑面令得醒悟」，謂成道已後鹿苑之前說人天教也。	Therefore, the text says, Sprinkling cold water on the face to make them wake up. This refers to the teachings of humans and gods before attaining enlightenment and after the Deer Park.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a13_17']	七者五戒十善暫息三途，次虛指二乘令出五趣，謂權誘恩也。	七者五戒十善暫息三途，次虛指二乘令出五趣，謂權誘恩也。	Seventh, the five precepts and ten wholesome deeds temporarily stop the three evil paths, and then point to the two vehicles to leave the five destinies. This is the kindness of provisional encouragement.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a16_6']	八者雖以小乘攝化，而密欲以大法教之，故說《波若》付財之教，但根鈍之徒猶未悟解，是為第八密化恩也。	八者雖以小乘攝化，而密欲以大法教之，故說《波若》付財之教，但根鈍之徒猶未悟解，是為第八密化恩也。	Eighth, although he uses the lesser vehicle to guide and transform, he secretly wishes to teach them with the great Dharma. Therefore, he expounds the teaching of entrusting the wealth of prajñā. However, those with dull faculties still do not understand. This is the eighth kindness of secret transformation.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a19_5']	九者從《波若》已後《法華》之前，中間說諸方等，現菩薩神變或說大士法門，種種方鼓動其情，令稍鄙小心欣慕大道，謂陶練小心恩。	九者從《波若》已後《法華》之前，中間說諸方等，現菩薩神變或說大士法門，種種方鼓動其情，令稍鄙小心欣慕大道，謂陶練小心恩。	Ninth, from the Prajnaparamita Sutra up to the Lotus Sutra, in the middle, it expounds various vaipulya sutras, manifesting the spiritual transformations of bodhisattvas or expounding the Dharma gates of great beings, using various methods to move their minds, causing them to gradually despise the small mind and yearn for the great way, which is called tempering the small mind.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a19_20']	故文云「復經小時」，即其事也。	故文云「復經小時」，即其事也。	Therefore, the text says after passing a period of time, which is exactly this matter.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368a22_10']	第十小志遂移、大機將動，為說《法華》會父子天性，今二乘之人令入一道，現在受記未來作佛，是為第十畢竟恩也。	第十小志遂移、大機將動，為說《法華》會父子天性，今二乘之人令入一道，現在受記未來作佛，是為第十畢竟恩也。	Tenth, the small mind is finally changed, and the great capacity is about to move. For them, the Lotus Sutra is expounded to unite the nature of father and son. Now, the teachings of the two vehicles are made to enter the one path. In the present, they receive predictions and in the future, they become buddhas. This is the tenth ultimate kindness.

Who can repay it? Therefore, it generally describes Shakyamuni's journey from his initial resolve up to this assembly, beginning and end, twists and turns, accumulating kalpas of hardships.

This is to make those who have already understood firm in the great and small, and those who are not yet enlightened to change from believing in the three to believing in the one.

['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368b04_5']	雖隨分受潤而不覺知，能覺知者是為希有。	雖隨分受潤而不覺知，能覺知者是為希有。	Although they receive moisture according to their capacity, they are not aware of it. Those who are aware of it are rare.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368b06_2']	如來慈身普覆法界、等潤五乘，眾生隨分受益而不覺知，若能覺知亦為希有也。	如來慈身普覆法界、等潤五乘，眾生隨分受益而不覺知，若能覺知亦為希有也。	The Tathagata's compassionate body universally covers the Dharma realm and equally moistens the five vehicles. Sentient beings receive benefits according to their capacity but are not aware of it. If they are able to be aware of it, that is also rare.

['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368b09_4']	不知異者，不知五乘眾生隨根成異。	不知異者，不知五乘眾生隨根成異。	Not knowing the different means not knowing that beings of the five vehicles achieve differences according to their faculties.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0368b10_12']	如草木不知一雲一雨謂不知同，不自知上中下差別謂不知異。	如草木不知一雲一雨謂不知同，不自知上中下差別謂不知異。	It is like grasses and trees not knowing that one cloud and one rain are the same, which means not knowing the same, and not knowing themselves to be of superior, middling, and inferior distinctions, which means not knowing the different.

Like the many treasures, although extinguished, not extinguished, it manifests that Shakyamuni, although born, is not born. Not born and not extinguished is called the original body, not born and showing birth, not extinguished and showing extinction is called the traces body.

Therefore, the later section is based on the spiritual powers wheel.
['ZH_T34_1720_001:0370c15_4']	故下文云「汝今諦聽如來祕密神通之力」，又云「神通力如是於阿僧祇劫」也。	故下文云「汝今諦聽如來祕密神通之力」，又云「神通力如是於阿僧祇劫」也。	Therefore, the text below says, You should now listen attentively to the Tathāgata's secret power of spiritual penetrations, and also says, The power of spiritual penetrations is like this for asaṃkhyeya kalpas.

Therefore, the chapter on Life Span extensively clarifies the meaning of near and far, and the long realization of the Dharma body from immeasurable eons ago.
