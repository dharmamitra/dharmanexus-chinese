For example, offering to a hundred stream-enterers is not as good as offering to one or two non-returners, up to the arhat.

He truly does not intentionally calculate, measure, or plan in sequence before bestowing this response.
['ZH_T34_1728_002:0932b09_11']	既無分別，亦無前後，任運成就，譬如明鏡隨對即現，一時等應，故言三業不護也。	既無分別，亦無前後，任運成就，譬如明鏡隨對即現，一時等應，故言三業不護也。	Since there is no discrimination, there is also no sequence.

Therefore, it is said to be understanding.

In the Dharma, one is impartial, and in wealth, one is also impartial. Giving like this is precisely giving the Dharma.

If one gives rise to the mind of true suchness, it is equal to the 84,000 dharma gates, which are also the 84,000 pāramitās, and also the 84,000 gates of afflictions, because they become the seeds of the Tathāgata.
