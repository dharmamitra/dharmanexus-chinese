['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c16_10']	以是樂道起時易故。	以是樂道起時易故。	Because it is easy to arouse the path of joy.
['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c17_1']	不起未至．中間．無色。	不起未至．中間．無色。	One does not arouse the preliminary stage, intermediate stage, or formless realm.
['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c17_10']	以是苦道起艱辛故。	以是苦道起艱辛故。	Because it is difficult to arouse the path of suffering.
['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c18_1']	得無學已亦不能起。	得無學已亦不能起。	After attaining the state of no learning, one is also unable to arouse it.

['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c22_13']	生已簡異中般。	生已簡異中般。	After being born distinguishes them from those of intermediate nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c23_7']	具二道故簡異有行．無行。	具二道故簡異有行．無行。	Because they are endowed with the two paths, they are distinguished from those of the type with exertion and those of the type without exertion.
['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c23_18']	此生般中所說般涅槃者。	此生般中所說般涅槃者。	The parinirvāṇa that is explained in this type of birth parinirvāṇa

['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c25_7']	故約有餘以釋生般不據無餘。	故約有餘以釋生般不據無餘。	Therefore, in explaining birth parinirvāṇa, it is based on that with remaining support, not on that without remaining support.
['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c26_3']	前中般中所以不別釋涅槃者。	前中般中所以不別釋涅槃者。	The reason why parinirvāṇa is not separately explained in the previous type of intermediate parinirvāṇa
['ZH_T41_1821_024:0360c26_8']	相不顯故。	相不顯故。	is because its characteristics are not evident.
