['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925a20_18']	德」有三十二行經，於此段中復分為七段。	德」有三十二行經，於此段中復分為七段。	The sixth section, from Furthermore, Bodhisattva Universal Eye, having heard the Tathagata praise Universal Worthy's pure merits and virtues, has thirty-two lines of scripture. Within this section, it is further divided into seven parts.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925a23_3']	一「爾時普眼菩薩」已下至「俱亦不見」有三行經，明普眼菩薩以十不可說三昧求覓普賢亦不能見分。	一「爾時普眼菩薩」已下至「俱亦不見」有三行經，明普眼菩薩以十不可說三昧求覓普賢亦不能見分。	1. From At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Eye to they also could not be seen, there are three lines of scripture, clarifying the part where Bodhisattva Universal Eye used the ten inexpressible samādhis to search for Universal Worthy but still could not see him.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925a25_12']	二「時普眼菩薩」已下至「悉皆不見」可有三行半經，明普眼菩薩從三昧起，白佛不見普賢菩薩身語意業及座分。	二「時普眼菩薩」已下至「悉皆不見」可有三行半經，明普眼菩薩從三昧起，白佛不見普賢菩薩身語意業及座分。	2. From At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Eye to they all could not be seen, there are about three and a half lines of scripture, clarifying the part where Bodhisattva Universal Eye, having arisen from samādhi, told the Buddha that he could not see Bodhisattva Universal Worthy's body, speech, mental activities, or seat.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925a28_6']	三「佛言如是」已下至「至於法界究竟邊際」有十二行經，明佛為普眼稱歎普賢三業甚深，不可以能出能入三昧能見分。	三「佛言如是」已下至「至於法界究竟邊際」有十二行經，明佛為普眼稱歎普賢三業甚深，不可以能出能入三昧能見分。	3. From The Buddha said, 'It is like this' to reaching the ultimate limit of the Dharma realm, there are twelve lines of scripture, clarifying the part where the Buddha praised Universal Worthy for Universal Worthy's three karmas being extremely profound, and that one cannot see him by emerging from or entering samādhi.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b01_8']	四「善男子」已下至「無空過者」有三行半經，明佛為歎見聞親近承事普賢菩薩利益無空過分。	四「善男子」已下至「無空過者」有三行半經，明佛為歎見聞親近承事普賢菩薩利益無空過分。	From Good men and women to none will be wasted, there are three and a half lines of text, clarifying the Buddha praising the benefits of seeing, hearing, being close to, and serving Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, with none being wasted.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b03_14', 'ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b06_12']	五「爾時普眼」已下至「頭頂禮敬」可有三行經，明普眼等及諸菩薩皆渴仰普賢，三稱南無頭頂禮敬分。🔽六「爾時佛告普眼」已下至「即當得見普賢菩薩」有六行半經，明佛更勸普眼等大眾更致禮敬，遍想法界推求普賢菩薩如對目前分。	五「爾時普眼」已下至「頭頂禮敬」可有三行經，明普眼等及諸菩薩皆渴仰普賢，三稱南無頭頂禮敬分。 六「爾時佛告普眼」已下至「即當得見普賢菩薩」有六行半經，明佛更勸普眼等大眾更致禮敬，遍想法界推求普賢菩薩如對目前分。	From At that time Samantabhadra to bowed his head in reverence, there are about three lines of text, clarifying Samantabhadra and the other bodhisattvas all yearning for Samantabhadra, thrice calling out namo and bowing their heads in reverence.🔽From At that time the Buddha told Samantabhadra to you will immediately see Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, there are six and a half lines of text, clarifying the Buddha further encouraging Samantabhadra and the great assembly to make prostrations, pervading the Dharma realm and searching for Samantabhadra Bodhisattva as if he were right before their eyes.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b09_3']	七「是時」已下至「皆見普賢大士」有一行半經，明普眼及諸菩薩大眾依佛勸勅更加禮敬，普賢知時欲為現身分。	七「是時」已下至「皆見普賢大士」有一行半經，明普眼及諸菩薩大眾依佛勸勅更加禮敬，普賢知時欲為現身分。	From At that time to all saw the great being Samantabhadra, there is one and a half lines of text, clarifying Samantabhadra and the great assembly of bodhisattvas, following the Buddha's instructions to make even more prostrations, with Samantabhadra knowing the time and wishing to manifest his body.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b11_10']	已上三十三行中七段經不見普賢菩薩，意明普眼等諸菩薩以出入三昧不得見普賢三業及座境界故。	已上三十三行中七段經不見普賢菩薩，意明普眼等諸菩薩以出入三昧不得見普賢三業及座境界故。	In the above thirty-three lines of text, there are seven sections where Samantabhadra Bodhisattva is not seen. The meaning is that Samantabhadra's three karmas and the realm of his seat cannot be seen by Samantabhadra and other bodhisattvas entering and exiting samādhi.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b13_6']	舉幻術文字中種種幻相所住處喻，明幻術文字之體了無處所，如何求之？	舉幻術文字中種種幻相所住處喻，明幻術文字之體了無處所，如何求之？	The analogy of the various illusory forms residing in the illusory spells and letters is used to illustrate that the essence of illusory spells and letters has no location at all, so how can one seek it?
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b15_11']	不可將出入三昧處所求之，去彼沈寂生滅却令想念，明想念動用自體遍周用而常寂，非更滅也。	不可將出入三昧處所求之，去彼沈寂生滅却令想念，明想念動用自體遍周用而常寂，非更滅也。	One cannot seek it in the location of entering and exiting samādhi. One should abandon the stillness and cessation of coming and going and allow thoughts to arise. It is explained that the self-nature of the movement and use of thoughts is universally pervasive. The use is always still, not extinguished again.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b18_6']	以是普賢以金剛慧普入法界，於一切世界無所行無所住，如一切眾生身皆非身無去無來，得無斷盡無差別自在神通。	以是普賢以金剛慧普入法界，於一切世界無所行無所住，如一切眾生身皆非身無去無來，得無斷盡無差別自在神通。	For this reason, Samantabhadra uses vajra wisdom to universally enter the Dharma realm. In all worlds, he has no activity and no abode. Like the bodies of all sentient beings are all non-bodies, without going and coming, he attains inexhaustible and undifferentiated spiritual powers.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b18_18']	此明任物自真，稱之為神。	此明任物自真，稱之為神。	This explains that entrusting things to their own truth is called spiritual.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b20_10']	不為不思、不定不亂、不來不去，任智遍周利生自在知根應現，名之為通。	不為不思、不定不亂、不來不去，任智遍周利生自在知根應現，名之為通。	It is not non-thought, not fixed, not confused, not coming, not going. It freely pervades and benefits beings, knowing the faculties and manifesting accordingly. This is called spiritual power.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b21_14']	萬法如是，無出入定亂，方稱普賢所行三業作用及座。	萬法如是，無出入定亂，方稱普賢所行三業作用及座。	The myriad dharmas are like this, without entering or exiting, being confused or not confused. Only then can it be called the activity of the three karmas and the seat practiced by Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b22_16']	如十地菩薩座體，但言滿三千大千世界之量。	如十地菩薩座體，但言滿三千大千世界之量。	Like the seat of the bodhisattvas of the ten grounds, it is only said to fill the realm of the trichiliocosm.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b23_17']	此普賢座量等虛空，一切法界大蓮華藏故。	此普賢座量等虛空，一切法界大蓮華藏故。	This seat of Samantabhadra is equal to the vastness of space, the great lotus treasury of all the Dharma realms.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b27_3']	明知十地菩薩智量猶隔，以此來昇此位，如許乖宜入出、如許不可說三昧之門，猶有寂用有限障，未得十地果位後普賢菩薩大自在故。	明知十地菩薩智量猶隔，以此來昇此位，如許乖宜入出、如許不可說三昧之門，猶有寂用有限障，未得十地果位後普賢菩薩大自在故。	It is clear that the wisdom realm of the bodhisattvas of the ten grounds still has limitations. By coming to ascend to this stage, it is like the inappropriateness of entering and exiting, like the inexpressible samādhi gate, still having limited obstructions between stillness and activity, not yet attaining the great freedom of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra in the fruition stage of the ten grounds.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925b28_3']	故三求普賢、三重昇進，却生想念，方始現身。	故三求普賢、三重昇進，却生想念，方始現身。	Therefore, seeking Samantabhadra in three ways and progressing in three stages, giving rise to thoughts, only then does he manifest his body.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c01_8']	及說十三昧境界之事，意責彼十地中猶有求於出世習，在於世間生死境界未得等於十方任用自在。	及說十三昧境界之事，意責彼十地中猶有求於出世習，在於世間生死境界未得等於十方任用自在。	And speaking of the matters of the realm of samādhi, the intention is to reproach them that even in the ten grounds there is still seeking for transcendence, and they are in the realm of worldly birth and death, not yet able to be equal to the unrestricted mastery of the ten directions.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c03_11']	以此如來教令却生想念，去彼十地中染習出世淨心故，此明治十地緣真俗出世餘習氣惑故。	以此如來教令却生想念，去彼十地中染習出世淨心故，此明治十地緣真俗出世餘習氣惑故。	For this reason, the Tathāgata instructs them to give rise to thoughts and remove the defiled habits of transcendence from the ten grounds, therefore this subdues the remaining habitual propensities of the ten grounds' discrimination of the mundane and supramundane.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c05_14']	已上意明治十地菩薩緣真俗二習未亡、寂亂二習未盡，於諸三昧有出入習故，未得寂入生死。	已上意明治十地菩薩緣真俗二習未亡、寂亂二習未盡，於諸三昧有出入習故，未得寂入生死。	Above, the intention is to subdue the remaining habits of the ten grounds' discrimination of the two truths, and the remaining habits of quiescence and disturbance, because in the various samādhis there are habits of entering and exiting, and one has not yet attained quiescent entry into birth and death.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c07_8']	猶如虛空性無作者而常普遍，非限量所收，一切眾生及以境界以之為體。	猶如虛空性無作者而常普遍，非限量所收，一切眾生及以境界以之為體。	It is just like the nature of space, which is without an agent and is always all-pervading, not included within any measure, with all sentient beings and their realms taken as its essence.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c08_7']	普賢之智猶如虛空，一切眾生以為其體。	普賢之智猶如虛空，一切眾生以為其體。	The wisdom of Samantabhadra is just like space, with all sentient beings taken as its essence.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c12_1']	有諸眾生自迷智者名為無明，普賢菩薩隨彼迷事，十方世界對現色身，以智無體猶如虛空，非造作性、無有去來、非生非滅，但以等虛空之智海，於一切處啟迷。	有諸眾生自迷智者名為無明，普賢菩薩隨彼迷事，十方世界對現色身，以智無體猶如虛空，非造作性、無有去來、非生非滅，但以等虛空之智海，於一切處啟迷。	There are sentient beings who are themselves deluded about wisdom, which is called ignorance. Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, in accordance with those deluded phenomena, manifests his physical body in the worlds of the ten directions. With wisdom having no substance, like empty space, not of a fabricated nature, without going or coming, neither arising nor ceasing, he merely uses the wisdom ocean equal to empty space to open up delusion everywhere.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c12_19']	智無體相，能隨等法界虛空界之大用故。	智無體相，能隨等法界虛空界之大用故。	Because wisdom, having no substance or characteristics, can accord with the great function of the Dharma realm and the realm of empty space.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c14_6']	豈將十地之位諸菩薩，以出入三昧有所推求，云何得見？	豈將十地之位諸菩薩，以出入三昧有所推求，云何得見？	How can the bodhisattvas of the ten grounds, by entering and exiting samādhi and seeking through investigation, see [Samantabhadra]?
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c15_9']	是故如來為諸菩薩說，幻術文字求其體相有可得不？	是故如來為諸菩薩說，幻術文字求其體相有可得不？	Therefore, the Tathāgata teaches the bodhisattvas, Do you seek the substance and characteristics of illusory techniques and written words?
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c16_8']	求幻之心尚不可得，如何有彼幻相可求？	求幻之心尚不可得，如何有彼幻相可求？	Even the mind seeking the illusion cannot be obtained, so how can there be the illusory phenomena that can be sought?
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c18_2']	是故將出入三昧及以求心而求普賢大用無依善巧智身，了無可得。	是故將出入三昧及以求心而求普賢大用無依善巧智身，了無可得。	Therefore, using the mind of entering and exiting samādhi and seeking, to seek Samantabhadra's great function, the skillful wisdom body without support, is completely unobtainable.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c21_2']	是故如來教諸菩薩却生想念，慇懃三禮普賢菩薩，方以神通力如應現身，明智身不可以三昧處所求，為智體無所住無所依故。	是故如來教諸菩薩却生想念，慇懃三禮普賢菩薩，方以神通力如應現身，明智身不可以三昧處所求，為智體無所住無所依故。	Therefore, the Tathāgata instructs the bodhisattvas to give rise to thoughts and earnestly bow three times to Samantabhadra, and only then does he manifest his body through the power of spiritual penetrations as appropriate. It is clear that the wisdom body cannot be sought in the location of samādhi, because the essence of wisdom is without abiding and without support.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c23_7']	若想念願樂，即如應現化，無有處所依止故，猶如谷響但有應物之音，若有所求即無有處所可得。	若想念願樂，即如應現化，無有處所依止故，猶如谷響但有應物之音，若有所求即無有處所可得。	If one gives rise to thoughts of aspiration and joy, then he will manifest transformations as appropriate, because there is no location or support. It is just like an echo that only has the sound of responding to things. If there is something sought, then there is no location that can be obtained.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c25_14']	佛言普賢菩薩今現在此道場眾會親近我住初無動移者，明以根本智性自無依，名為現在此道場故。	佛言普賢菩薩今現在此道場眾會親近我住初無動移者，明以根本智性自無依，名為現在此道場故。	The Buddha says that Samantabhadra Bodhisattva is now present in the assembly of this Dharma assembly, intimately dwelling near me without ever moving. This clarifies that the nature of fundamental wisdom itself has no reliance, and is called being present in this Dharma assembly.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c27_17']	為能治有所得諸見蘊故，以無礙總別同異普光明智與十方一切諸佛大用體同，名為眾會故。	為能治有所得諸見蘊故，以無礙總別同異普光明智與十方一切諸佛大用體同，名為眾會故。	In order to treat the views and aggregates that are attained, using the unobstructed, universal, and distinct same and different universally illuminating wisdom, the essence of the great function is the same as that of all buddhas in the ten directions, and is called the assembly.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0925c29_14']	無邊差別智海一時等用，不移根本智體無依住智，名為親近我住初無動移故。	無邊差別智海一時等用，不移根本智體無依住智，名為親近我住初無動移故。	The ocean of wisdom with boundless distinctions is used equally at one time, without moving from the fundamental wisdom essence, the wisdom of non-abiding, and is called approaching. I abide in the initial state without movement.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a01_9']	云稱南無者，明歸命信順故。	云稱南無者，明歸命信順故。	As for calling out namo, it clarifies taking refuge and being in accord with faith.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a02_11']	約法以南為离，為离中虛，以虛無故即明离為日。	約法以南為离，為离中虛，以虛無故即明离為日。	In terms of the Dharma, the south is associated with Li (the trigram for fire), which is the emptiness within Li. Because of emptiness, it clarifies that Li is the sun.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a04_5']	离主心，以心達虛無之理，即心智明，故云南無，表歸命信順虛無之理智故。	离主心，以心達虛無之理，即心智明，故云南無，表歸命信順虛無之理智故。	Li governs the mind. Using the mind to penetrate the principle of emptiness is the illumination of the wisdom of the mind, so it calls out namo, expressing taking refuge and being in accord with the principle of the wisdom of emptiness.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a05_2']	是故善財南方詢友者，義亦如然。	是故善財南方詢友者，義亦如然。	Therefore, Sudhana's seeking of friends in the south is also like this in meaning.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a05_14']	龍女南方成佛，義亦如之。	龍女南方成佛，義亦如之。	The dragon girl's enlightenment in the south is also like this in meaning.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a06_8']	但達虛無之理智，十方總南無。	但達虛無之理智，十方總南無。	But if one penetrates the principle of emptiness, the ten directions are all namo.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a07_4']	若執諸法作實有者，十方總北故。	若執諸法作實有者，十方總北故。	If one grasps all dharmas as real existences, the ten directions are all not namo.

['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a11_7']	一「爾時普賢菩薩」已下至「示現一切三世諸佛」有七行經，明普賢菩薩如應現身分。	一「爾時普賢菩薩」已下至「示現一切三世諸佛」有七行經，明普賢菩薩如應現身分。	The first, from At that time, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra to manifesting all buddhas of the three times, has seven lines of text, clarifying the part where Bodhisattva Samantabhadra manifests his body as appropriate.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a13_17']	二「是時普眼菩薩」已下至「如見十方一切諸佛」有兩行半經，明菩薩大眾得見普賢，菩薩歡喜如見十方諸佛分。	二「是時普眼菩薩」已下至「如見十方一切諸佛」有兩行半經，明菩薩大眾得見普賢，菩薩歡喜如見十方諸佛分。	The second, from At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Eye to seeing all buddhas of the ten directions as if they were present, has two and a half lines of text, clarifying the part where the great assembly of bodhisattvas sees Samantabhadra, and the bodhisattvas rejoice as if seeing the buddhas of the ten directions.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a16_8']	三「是時」已下可有十行經，明諸菩薩信解力、普賢菩薩本願，興雲供養，光明普照息三惡趣，令諸菩薩入普賢行分。	三「是時」已下可有十行經，明諸菩薩信解力、普賢菩薩本願，興雲供養，光明普照息三惡趣，令諸菩薩入普賢行分。	The third, from At that time, has about ten lines of text, clarifying the part where the power of the bodhisattvas' faith and understanding, and the original vow of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, give rise to clouds of offerings, with light shining everywhere to end the three evil destinies, causing the bodhisattvas to enter the practice of Samantabhadra.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a18_10']	如普賢菩薩如應現身即見故，將出入三昧求即不得見，明無出入智不可作出入三昧求故。	如普賢菩薩如應現身即見故，將出入三昧求即不得見，明無出入智不可作出入三昧求故。	Because if one sees the body of Samantabhadra as it should be, one will immediately see it. If one seeks to enter or exit samādhi, one will not be able to see it. This clarifies that the wisdom of neither entering nor exiting cannot be sought through the samādhi of entering and exiting.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a19_3']	自非位合道同，智自會矣。	自非位合道同，智自會矣。	If one does not personally accord with the Way and unite with wisdom, one will not understand.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a20_5']	想念而見，且是如應現身故，然後方會其本身也。	想念而見，且是如應現身故，然後方會其本身也。	If one sees it through thought and recollection, it is because the body appears as it should be. Only then will one meet its true body.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a20_12']	餘義如文自具。	餘義如文自具。	The other meanings are complete in the text itself.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a21_17']	意明無依住智是普賢之大體，如應現身是普賢之大用。	意明無依住智是普賢之大體，如應現身是普賢之大用。	The meaning clarifies that the wisdom of non-abiding is Samantabhadra's great essence, and the body appearing as it should be is Samantabhadra's great function.
['ZH_T36_1739_030:0926a24_2']	第八「爾時普眼菩薩」已下一段九行半經，明普眼歎普賢十種廣大住，如來歎普賢十廣大功德。	第八「爾時普眼菩薩」已下一段九行半經，明普眼歎普賢十種廣大住，如來歎普賢十廣大功德。	The section from At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Eye onwards, in nine and a half lines of text, clarifies Universal Eye praising Samantabhadra's ten kinds of vast abodes, and the Tathāgata praising Samantabhadra's ten vast merits.
