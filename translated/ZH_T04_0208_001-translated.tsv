['ZH_T04_0208_001:0531b13_1']	黠慧之人明識火勢，火未至時急出財物，舍雖燒盡財寶全在，更修屋宅廣開利業。	黠慧之人明識火勢，火未至時急出財物，舍雖燒盡財寶全在，更修屋宅廣開利業。	A wise person clearly recognizes the power of fire. Before the fire reaches, they quickly take out their wealth. Although the house burns down, the treasures are preserved, and they repair the house again and expand their profitable business.
['ZH_T04_0208_001:0531b16_5']	智人植福勤修布施亦復如是，知身危脆財物無常，遇值福田及時布施，亦如彼人火中出物，後世受樂，亦如彼人更修宅業福利自慰。	智人植福勤修布施亦復如是，知身危脆財物無常，遇值福田及時布施，亦如彼人火中出物，後世受樂，亦如彼人更修宅業福利自慰。	The wise person planting blessings and diligently practicing giving is also like this. Knowing that the body is fragile and wealth is impermanent, they encounter the field of blessings and give at the right time, also like that person taking things out of the fire. In the next life, they experience happiness, also like that person repairing the house and benefiting themselves with blessings.
['ZH_T04_0208_001:0531b19_10']	愚惑之人但知惜念，怱怱營救狂惑失智，不量火勢猛風絕燄土石俱燋，須臾之頃蕩然滅盡，屋既不救財物喪失，飢寒凍餓憂苦畢世。	愚惑之人但知惜念，怱怱營救狂惑失智，不量火勢猛風絕燄土石俱燋，須臾之頃蕩然滅盡，屋既不救財物喪失，飢寒凍餓憂苦畢世。	Foolish and deluded people only know how to be stingy and immediately rush to save, losing their wisdom in confusion.

The house is not saved, and the wealth and belongings are lost. They suffer from hunger and cold for the rest of their lives.

They do not know that life and body are impermanent and cannot be preserved for a moment. They hoard and guard their belongings, cherishing them. When death comes unexpectedly and they suddenly pass away, their body is like a piece of wood and their wealth is abandoned. It is also like the foolish person who worries and loses his plan.
