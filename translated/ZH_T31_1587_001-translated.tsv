The object here refers to the object of consciousness-only, and the distraction of consciousness-only is due to the absence of objects, so consciousness is absent.
['ZH_T31_1587_001:0063c17_9']	此識既無，能緣唯識之心亦無，故云二不顯現。	此識既無，能緣唯識之心亦無，故云二不顯現。	Since this consciousness is already absent, the mind that takes consciousness-only as its object is also absent. Therefore, it is said that the two do not manifest.
['ZH_T31_1587_001:0063c18_1']	此二但談二識所現前境。	此二但談二識所現前境。	These two only discuss the objects that manifest in front of the two consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1587_001:0063c18_17']	前境先已無故，是名識轉品究竟也。	前境先已無故，是名識轉品究竟也。	Since the previous object has already been absent, this is called the culmination of the stage of the transformation of consciousness.
