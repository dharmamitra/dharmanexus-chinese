Above, it clarifies that the meaning of the Tathāgata's phrase does not fall into the four propositions. Fearing those who have not yet realized it would say that the meaning of the Tathāgata's phrase is also not the true nature, it therefore uses an analogy to illustrate.

['ZH_T39_1789_04a:0404b09_20']	故又以喻顯，如牛但有牛之性而無馬性，馬但有馬之性而無牛性，故云「非有非無。	故又以喻顯，如牛但有牛之性而無馬性，馬但有馬之性而無牛性，故云「非有非無。	Therefore, it is also illustrated with a metaphor. A cow only has the nature of a cow and not the nature of a horse. A horse only has the nature of a horse and not the nature of a cow. Therefore, it is said, neither existent nor nonexistent.
['ZH_T39_1789_04a:0404b10_10']	」謂彼各有自性而無他性。	」謂彼各有自性而無他性。	It means that each has its own nature and not the nature of the other.
