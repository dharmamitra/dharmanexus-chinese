All of them were arhats, their outflows exhausted, free from afflictions, their work done, their heavy burden laid down, their own goal attained, all bonds of existence ended, their minds well liberated. Only two people were exceptions: the Venerable Ānanda and the Venerable Rāhula.🔽At that time, the World-Honored One, in the last month of summer, on the fifteenth day, entered the samādhi of the lion's play. Sitting in the cross-legged position, his body was straight, and he single-mindedly focused his mind. With the power of samādhi, he emitted light from his body, illuminating the trichiliocosm, and the light then returned and entered the crown of his head.
