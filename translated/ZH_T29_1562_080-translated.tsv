['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b17_17']	八中前三無貪為性，近治貪故。	八中前三無貪為性，近治貪故。	Among the eight, the first three have non-greed as their nature, because they are close to the antidote of greed.

['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b19_1']	想觀者想觀增故，如宿住念除去色想。	想觀者想觀增故，如宿住念除去色想。	The perceiver of conceptualization is because conceptualization increases, just as the recollection of past lives removes the conceptualization of form.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b19_19']	三中初二不淨相轉，作青瘀等諸行相故。	三中初二不淨相轉，作青瘀等諸行相故。	Among the three, the first two are the transformation of the characteristics of impurity, because they take on the characteristics of various activities such as blue, rotting, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b20_17']	第三解脫清淨相轉，作淨光鮮行相轉故。	第三解脫清淨相轉，作淨光鮮行相轉故。	The third liberation is the transformation of the characteristics of purity, because it transforms into the characteristics of pure radiance.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b21_8']	三并助伴，皆五蘊性。	三并助伴，皆五蘊性。	When the three are combined with their auxiliaries, they all have the nature of the five aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b22_15']	初二解脫一一通依初二靜慮，能治欲界初靜慮中顯色貪故。	初二解脫一一通依初二靜慮，能治欲界初靜慮中顯色貪故。	The first two liberations are both based on the first two meditations, because they can counteract the greed for visible form in the desire realm and the first meditation.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b23_14']	初二通攝近分中間，五地皆能起初二故。	初二通攝近分中間，五地皆能起初二故。	The first two comprehensively include the preliminary stages and the intermediate state, because they can arise in the five stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b25_11']	欲及初定有顯色貪，由眼識身所引起故，為解脫彼，初二定中建立初二不淨解脫。	欲及初定有顯色貪，由眼識身所引起故，為解脫彼，初二定中建立初二不淨解脫。	The desire realm and the first trance state have craving for visible form, because they are attracted by the body of visual consciousness. In order to be liberated from them, the first two pure liberations are established in the first two trance states.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b27_3']	二三定中眼識無故，亦無所引緣顯色貪故，三四定中無不淨解脫。	二三定中眼識無故，亦無所引緣顯色貪故，三四定中無不淨解脫。	In the second and third trance states, there is no visual consciousness, and there is also no craving for visible form that is attracted by it. Therefore the first two pure liberations do not exist in the third and fourth trance states.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771b29_2']	初二解脫相似善根，雖欲界中亦容得有，而為欲界貪所𣣋雜，故不建立二解脫名。	初二解脫相似善根，雖欲界中亦容得有，而為欲界貪所𣣋雜，故不建立二解脫名。	Although the two roots of good similar to the first two liberations may exist in the desire realm, they are mixed with the craving of the desire realm, and therefore the name of the two liberations is not established.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c01_15']	三四定中雖亦得有，去所治遠勢力微劣，又樂淨伏，故不得名第三解脫。	三四定中雖亦得有，去所治遠勢力微劣，又樂淨伏，故不得名第三解脫。	Although they may exist in the third and fourth trance states, they are far removed from their objects of abandonment and are weak in power, and they are also subdued by pleasure and purity. Therefore they are not given the name of the third liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c02_9']	依後靜慮離八災患，心澄淨故。	依後靜慮離八災患，心澄淨故。	It is established on the basis of the fourth trance state, because the mind is clear and pure, free from the eight faults.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c03_1']	第四并近分，立後靜慮名。	第四并近分，立後靜慮名。	The fourth trance state and its preliminary concentration are given the name of the fourth trance state.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c05_16']	相似善根下地雖有，非增上故不名解脫，欲界欲貪所𣣋雜故，初二定中不淨伏故，第三定中樂所迷故，又並八災所擾亂故。	相似善根下地雖有，非增上故不名解脫，欲界欲貪所𣣋雜故，初二定中不淨伏故，第三定中樂所迷故，又並八災所擾亂故。	Although similar wholesome roots exist in the lower stages, they are not called liberations because they are not dominant. Because they are mixed with the desire realm's desire and greed, because the first two concentrations are suppressed by impurity, because the third concentration is deluded by bliss, and because they are all disturbed by the eight calamities.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c07_6']	次四解脫如其次第，以四無色定善為性，非無記染，非解脫故；	次四解脫如其次第，以四無色定善為性，非無記染，非解脫故；	The next four liberations are, in their order, by nature the wholesome of the four formless concentrations. They are neither indeterminate nor defiled, because they are not liberations.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c07_16']	亦非散善，性羸劣故。	亦非散善，性羸劣故。	They are also not scattered wholesome [roots], because their nature is weak.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c08_4']	彼散善者，如命終心。	彼散善者，如命終心。	Those scattered wholesome [roots] are like the mind at the end of life.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c09_3']	有說餘時亦有散善，唯生得善無聞思故。	有說餘時亦有散善，唯生得善無聞思故。	Some say that at other times there are also scattered wholesome [roots], but only innate wholesome [roots] are without hearing and thinking.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c10_14']	諸近分地九無間道、八解脫道亦非解脫，不背下地故，緣下道雜故。	諸近分地九無間道、八解脫道亦非解脫，不背下地故，緣下道雜故。	The nine uninterrupted paths and eight liberation paths of the preliminary stages are also not liberations, because they do not turn their backs on the lower stages, because they are mixed with the paths of the lower stages,
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c11_12']	又未全脫下地染故，契經說彼超過下故。	又未全脫下地染故，契經說彼超過下故。	and because they have not completely freed themselves from the defilements of the lower stages. A scripture says that they transcend the lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c12_11']	有說近分諸解脫道亦名解脫，背下地故。	有說近分諸解脫道亦名解脫，背下地故。	Some say that the liberation paths of the preliminary stages are also called liberations, because they turn their backs on the lower stages.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c13_12']	然於餘處唯說根本者，以近分中非全解脫故。	然於餘處唯說根本者，以近分中非全解脫故。	However, in other places it is said that only the fundamental samādhi is the support of the samādhi of cessation, because in the preliminary concentrations there is not complete liberation.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c15_1']	第八解脫即滅盡定，厭背受想而起此故，或總厭背有所緣故。	第八解脫即滅盡定，厭背受想而起此故，或總厭背有所緣故。	The eighth liberation is the samādhi of cessation. It is produced by turning away from and despising feeling and conceptualization, or it is produced by turning away from and despising all objects of sense and understanding.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c15_6']	然上座言：	然上座言：	However, the elder Dharmatrāta says,
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c15_19']	即諸有情相續分位名滅盡定。	即諸有情相續分位名滅盡定。	The state of the continuity of sentient beings is called the samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c16_18']	此亦非理，前已廣辯，此滅盡定實有體故。	此亦非理，前已廣辯，此滅盡定實有體故。	This is also unreasonable, because we have already discussed this at length. The samādhi of cessation must have a real substance.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c18_8']	又不可說此定有心，曾不見有心無受想思故，無容於此越路而行。	又不可說此定有心，曾不見有心無受想思故，無容於此越路而行。	Also, it cannot be said that this samādhi has mind, because we have never seen mind without feeling, conceptualization, and volition. It is impossible to go beyond the path.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c20_14']	如說此中受想等滅寂靜安樂，阿羅漢等乃有如是殊勝解脫，非無義本相續及心可說名為安樂寂靜。	如說此中受想等滅寂靜安樂，阿羅漢等乃有如是殊勝解脫，非無義本相續及心可說名為安樂寂靜。	It is said that in this samādhi, feeling, conceptualization, etc., are extinguished, and it is peaceful and happy. The arhat, etc., have such a superior liberation. If it has no substance, how can the continuity of mind and its activities be said to be peaceful and happy?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c21_9']	阿羅漢等殊勝解脫如何計度？	阿羅漢等殊勝解脫如何計度？	How can the superior liberation of the arhat, etc., be imagined?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c22_4']	有一類心無有所緣離行相轉。	有一類心無有所緣離行相轉。	There is a kind of mind that has no object and evolves apart from the characteristics of activity.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c23_3']	有所緣者理必有觸，若許有觸寧無受果？	有所緣者理必有觸，若許有觸寧無受果？	If there is an object, there must be contact. If you admit that there is contact, how can there be no feeling as a result?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c23_12']	應言何礙受等不生？	應言何礙受等不生？	What prevents feeling, etc., from arising?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c24_2']	故滅定中無有心理。	故滅定中無有心理。	Therefore there is no mental activity in the samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c25_1']	非迷正理，纔覽經文便能會通聖教深趣。	非迷正理，纔覽經文便能會通聖教深趣。	Those who are confused about the correct principles of the scriptures and who merely skim the texts are unable to understand the profound purport of the holy teachings.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c26_2']	識非永滅言不離身，如病未永除，暫息亦名有。	識非永滅言不離身，如病未永除，暫息亦名有。	The statement that consciousness is not eternally extinguished and does not leave the body is like the case where a disease is not yet permanently cured, and a temporary remission is still called having the disease.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c27_19']	微微心後此定現前，前對想心已名微細，此更微細故曰微微，次如是心入滅盡定。	微微心後此定現前，前對想心已名微細，此更微細故曰微微，次如是心入滅盡定。	This samādhi appears after the mind of the second and third formless realms, and the mind of the peak of existence is called subtle, and this is even more subtle, and is therefore called very subtle. Next, a mind like this enters the samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0771c29_7']	謂有頂地心有三品，即想、微細及微微心，由上中下品類別故。	謂有頂地心有三品，即想、微細及微微心，由上中下品類別故。	That is, the mind of the peak of existence has three grades, namely, the mind of conceptualization, the subtle mind, and the very subtle mind, because of the distinction of superior, middling, and inferior grades.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a01_6']	要下品後滅定現前，故次微微入滅盡定。	要下品後滅定現前，故次微微入滅盡定。	The samādhi of cessation appears only after the inferior grade, and therefore after the very subtle mind one enters the samādhi of cessation.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a03_11']	從滅定出或起有頂淨定心，或即能起無所有處無漏心，如是入心唯是有漏，通從有漏無漏心出。	從滅定出或起有頂淨定心，或即能起無所有處無漏心，如是入心唯是有漏，通從有漏無漏心出。	When one emerges from the samādhi of cessation, one either produces a pure thought of the peak of existence or one produces a thought of the sphere of nothingness that is pure and uncontaminated. The thought that enters this samādhi is only contaminated, but one emerges from it through a contaminated or an uncontaminated thought.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a04_20']	八中前三唯以欲界色處為境，有差別者，二取不淨、一取淨相。	八中前三唯以欲界色處為境，有差別者，二取不淨、一取淨相。	Among the eight liberations, the first three only take the form base of the desire realm as their object. There is a difference in that two take the impure as their object and one takes the pure as its object.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a06_1']	既諸色中亦有淨界，總觀為不淨，寧非顛倒攝？	既諸色中亦有淨界，總觀為不淨，寧非顛倒攝？	Since there is also a pure realm among all forms, when one generally views them as impure, why are they not categorized as perversions?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a06_10']	如於苦法計樂成倒。	如於苦法計樂成倒。	It is like the case of taking impermanent dharmas as a self, which is a perversion.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a07_17']	謂諸行中亦有苦雜，一向計樂成顛倒故，第三取淨為難亦爾。	謂諸行中亦有苦雜，一向計樂成顛倒故，第三取淨為難亦爾。	That is, since there is also suffering mixed in among the conditioned dharmas, taking them as only pleasure is a perversion. The third liberation, which takes the pure as its object, is also a perversion.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a08_8']	此非過失，是所許故。	此非過失，是所許故。	This is not a mistake, because it is accepted.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a08_17']	謂亦許此是倒思惟。	謂亦許此是倒思惟。	That is, it is also accepted that this is a perverted thought.

['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a09_15']	此是離染所得果故。	此是離染所得果故。	It is the result obtained by the separation from the passions.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a10_7']	既不稱實，何能違染？	既不稱實，何能違染？	Since it does not accord with reality, how can it be able to oppose the passions?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a10_16']	令順生貪作意遠故。	令順生貪作意遠故。	Because the attention that produces it is distant.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a12_13']	如未離欲，於淨不淨思惟淨相能順生貪，非此淨中見於淨相，不顛倒故可善性攝。	如未離欲，於淨不淨思惟淨相能順生貪，非此淨中見於淨相，不顛倒故可善性攝。	For example, one who is not yet free from desire, when contemplating the pure characteristics of the impure, can give rise to craving. This is not seeing the pure characteristics in the pure, because it is not a mistaken view and can be categorized as wholesome.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a14_11']	如是離欲，於淨不淨思惟不淨能遠離貪，非此淨中見不淨相，是顛倒故不善性攝。	如是離欲，於淨不淨思惟不淨能遠離貪，非此淨中見不淨相，是顛倒故不善性攝。	In the same way, one who is free from desire, when contemplating the impurity of the pure and the impure, can become detached from craving. This is not seeing the impure characteristics in the pure, because it is a mistaken view and is categorized as unwholesome.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a15_1']	亦應例釋不淨見淨。	亦應例釋不淨見淨。	One should also explain the case of seeing the impure as pure in the same way.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a16_9']	或此非謂顛倒思惟，諸不淨法總有二種，一者自體、二者相雜。	或此非謂顛倒思惟，諸不淨法總有二種，一者自體、二者相雜。	Or this is not called mistaken contemplation. All impure dharmas are generally of two kinds: first, the substance itself; second, that which is mixed with them.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a17_17']	諸清淨法雜不淨故亦名不淨，世所極成，故此思惟不名顛倒。	諸清淨法雜不淨故亦名不淨，世所極成，故此思惟不名顛倒。	Because pure dharmas are mixed with the impure, they are also called impure. This is universally recognized in the world, and therefore this contemplation is not called mistaken.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a18_7']	不淨雜淨，例亦應爾。	不淨雜淨，例亦應爾。	The impure mixed with the pure should be the same.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a21_15']	然觀行者初修觀時，非亦於淨界取不淨相，但於不淨界取不淨相，令心極厭惡違逆行相轉，後漸增廣違逆行相，普於欲界色處境中總起厭心不生貪染。	然觀行者初修觀時，非亦於淨界取不淨相，但於不淨界取不淨相，令心極厭惡違逆行相轉，後漸增廣違逆行相，普於欲界色處境中總起厭心不生貪染。	However, when a practitioner of contemplation first cultivates contemplation, he does not take the aspect of impurity in the pure realm, but only takes the aspect of impurity in the impure realm, causing the mind to turn to the aspect of extreme disgust and opposition. Later, gradually increasing and expanding the aspect of opposition, he universally arouses a mind of disgust in the objects of the form realm in the desire realm and does not give rise to defiled craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a22_17']	若於純淨界色界色聚中，勝解無能取不淨相。	若於純淨界色界色聚中，勝解無能取不淨相。	If in a pure realm, a form aggregate in the form realm, one's resolve would be unable to take the aspect of impurity.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a24_14']	既唯欲界諸色聚中勝解方能取不淨相，故知欲界諸色聚中決定亦有不淨界性。	既唯欲界諸色聚中勝解方能取不淨相，故知欲界諸色聚中決定亦有不淨界性。	Since one's resolve is only able to take the aspect of impurity in the form aggregates in the desire realm, one should know that in the form aggregates in the desire realm there definitely also exists the nature of the impure realm.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a25_14']	既如不淨作不淨解，如何可言是顛倒性？	既如不淨作不淨解，如何可言是顛倒性？	Since it is like taking impurity and forming the understanding of impurity, how can it be said to be the nature of error?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a26_4']	第三取淨，例此應知。	第三取淨，例此應知。	The third, taking purity, should be understood as an example of this.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a27_3']	此於所緣既如實轉，如何說是勝解作意？	此於所緣既如實轉，如何說是勝解作意？	Since this turns to the object as it really is, how is it said to be the attention of resolve?
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a28_2']	由勝解力此於境生，故說此為勝解作意。	由勝解力此於境生，故說此為勝解作意。	Because this arises toward the object by the power of resolve, it is said to be the attention of resolve.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772a29_1']	即由此故得解脫名，勝解解脫義相隣故。	即由此故得解脫名，勝解解脫義相隣故。	For this reason it is called liberation, because the meanings of “superior resolve” and “liberation” are similar.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772b01_2']	或於少事由勝解力漸漸增益觀，名勝解作意。	或於少事由勝解力漸漸增益觀，名勝解作意。	Or, in regard to a small object, by the power of superior resolve one gradually increases it and observes it, which is called attention accompanied by superior resolve.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772b02_1']	謂於少淨漸增益觀，因此便生無量貪染。	謂於少淨漸增益觀，因此便生無量貪染。	That is, one gradually increases and observes a small pure object, and because of this one produces an immeasurable amount of defiled craving.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772b02_19']	此既生已，心於所緣遂被拘執不自在轉。	此既生已，心於所緣遂被拘執不自在轉。	When this craving is produced, the mind is constrained by the object and does not function freely.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0772b03_17']	於少不淨漸增益觀，與前相違增諸善本。	於少不淨漸增益觀，與前相違增諸善本。	One gradually increases and observes a small impure object, and the opposite occurs, and one increases the roots of good.

['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775a29_13']	有持說行者，　　此便住世間。	有持說行者，　　此便住世間。	As long as there are those who uphold, expound, and practice it, it will remain in the world.

['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b01_18']	世尊正法，體有二種，一教、二證。	世尊正法，體有二種，一教、二證。	The World-Honored One's true Dharma has two aspects as its essence: first, the teachings; second, realization.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b02_15']	教謂契經、調伏對法，證謂三乘諸無漏道。	教謂契經、調伏對法，證謂三乘諸無漏道。	The teachings refer to the sutras, vinaya, and abhidharma; realization refers to the uncontaminated paths of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b03_13']	若證正法住在世間，此所弘持教法亦住。	若證正法住在世間，此所弘持教法亦住。	If the realized true Dharma abides in the world, then the taught Dharma that is propagated and upheld will also abide.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b05_2']	理必應爾，現見東方證法衰微教多隱沒，北方證法猶增盛故。	理必應爾，現見東方證法衰微教多隱沒，北方證法猶增盛故。	This must necessarily be so. It is currently seen that in the east the realized Dharma is declining and the teachings are mostly disappearing, while in the north the realized Dharma is still flourishing.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b07_8']	世尊正教流布尚多，由此如來無上智境眾聖栖宅，阿毘達磨無倒實義此國盛行，非東方等所能傳習。	世尊正教流布尚多，由此如來無上智境眾聖栖宅，阿毘達磨無倒實義此國盛行，非東方等所能傳習。	The World-Honored One's true teachings are still widely disseminated. For this reason, the unsurpassed realm of wisdom of the Tathagata, the abode of the sages, and the unerring true meaning of abhidharma are flourishing in this country, and cannot be transmitted and studied in the east and other places.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b08_16']	二中教法多分依止持者說者得住世間，證正法住唯依行者。	二中教法多分依止持者說者得住世間，證正法住唯依行者。	Of these two, the Dharma of teaching mostly depends on the holders and expounders for its continuance in the world, while the realization of the true Dharma depends only on practitioners.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b09_15']	然非行者唯證法依，教法亦應依行者故。	然非行者唯證法依，教法亦應依行者故。	However, the Dharma of realization is not only based on practitioners, the Dharma of teaching should also be based on practitioners.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b11_13']	謂有無倒修行法者，能令證法久住世間，證法住時教法亦住，故教法住由持說行。	謂有無倒修行法者，能令證法久住世間，證法住時教法亦住，故教法住由持說行。	This is because those who practice the Dharma without error can cause the realized Dharma to remain in the world for a long time. When the realized Dharma abides, the Dharma of teaching also abides. Therefore, the continuance of the Dharma of teaching is due to the practice of upholding and expounding.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b13_2']	但由行者令證法住，故佛正法隨此三人住爾所時便住於世。	但由行者令證法住，故佛正法隨此三人住爾所時便住於世。	However, it is only through practitioners that the realized Dharma is made to abide. Therefore, the true Dharma of the Buddha abides in the world for as long as these three types of people remain.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b14_1']	阿毘達磨此論所依，此攝彼中真實要義。	阿毘達磨此論所依，此攝彼中真實要義。	The Abhidharma is the basis of this treatise. It includes the true and essential meaning of that.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b14_19']	彼論中義釋有多途，今此論中依何理釋？	彼論中義釋有多途，今此論中依何理釋？	The meaning in that treatise has many interpretations. Based on what principle is this treatise interpreted?

['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b16_0']	迦濕彌羅議理成，　　我多依彼釋對法，	迦濕彌羅議理成，　　我多依彼釋對法，	The reasoning established by the Kashmiri scholars, I mostly rely on that to explain the Abhidharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b17_17']	少有貶量為我失，　　判法正理在牟尼。	少有貶量為我失，　　判法正理在牟尼。	There are few deprecations, which are my faults. The correct principle of judging dharmas lies with the Sage.

['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b19_12']	迦濕彌羅國毘婆沙師議阿毘達磨理善成立，我多依彼釋對法宗。	迦濕彌羅國毘婆沙師議阿毘達磨理善成立，我多依彼釋對法宗。	The Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīra have discussed the principles of Abhidharma and established them well. I rely on them extensively in explaining the tenets of Abhidharma.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b22_17']	經主此中述己本意，言依此國諸善逝子議對法理大毘婆沙，發起正勤如理觀察，為令正法久住世間，饒益有情故造斯論，多言顯示少有異途。	經主此中述己本意，言依此國諸善逝子議對法理大毘婆沙，發起正勤如理觀察，為令正法久住世間，饒益有情故造斯論，多言顯示少有異途。	Here the author of the treatise states his original intention, saying that he has discussed the principles of Abhidharma based on the Mahāvibhāṣā of the sons of the Well-Gone Ones of this country, aroused right effort, and contemplated in accordance with principle, in order to cause the true Dharma to abide in the world for a long time and benefit sentient beings, and thus composed this treatise. The word many shows that there are few differences.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b23_7']	謂形像色去來世等。	謂形像色去來世等。	Namely, the colors of images, the past and future worlds, etc.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b26_4']	然諸法性廣大甚深，如實說者甚為難遇，自惟覺慧極為微劣，不能勤求如實說者，故於廣論所立理中，少有貶量為我過失。	然諸法性廣大甚深，如實說者甚為難遇，自惟覺慧極為微劣，不能勤求如實說者，故於廣論所立理中，少有貶量為我過失。	However, the nature of dharmas is vast and profound. It is extremely difficult to explain it as it truly is. I myself realize that my understanding is extremely shallow, and I am unable to diligently seek to explain it as it truly is. Therefore, in the principles established in the extensive treatises, there are few deprecations, which is my fault.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b28_2']	諸法正理廣大甚深，要昔曾於無量佛所親近修習真智資糧，方於智境一切無惑。	諸法正理廣大甚深，要昔曾於無量佛所親近修習真智資糧，方於智境一切無惑。	The true principles of dharmas are vast and profound. One must have long since been close to and cultivated the true wisdom provisions under innumerable Buddhas in order to be without any doubts regarding the realm of wisdom.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775b29_10']	麟喻獨覺尚於法相不能決判，況諸聲聞，彼所證法隨他教故。	麟喻獨覺尚於法相不能決判，況諸聲聞，彼所證法隨他教故。	Even pratyekabuddhas who are like rhinoceroses cannot decisively judge the characteristics of dharmas, let alone śrāvakas, because the dharmas they realize follow the teachings of others.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775c01_8']	由此決判諸法正理，唯在真實大牟尼尊。	由此決判諸法正理，唯在真實大牟尼尊。	Therefore, the decisive judgment of the correct principles of dharmas is solely in the true and great sage.
['ZH_T29_1562_080:0775c02_18']	是故定知阿毘達磨，真是佛說，應隨信受，無倒修行，勤求解脫。	是故定知阿毘達磨，真是佛說，應隨信受，無倒修行，勤求解脫。	Therefore, it is definitely known that the Abhidharma is truly spoken by the Buddha, and one should follow it with faith and practice it without error, diligently seeking liberation.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
