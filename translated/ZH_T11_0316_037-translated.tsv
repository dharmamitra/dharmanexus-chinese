['ZH_T11_0316_037:0877a23_17']	謂諸菩薩以聖慧眼得見諸法，於中入解，乃至菩提道場觀諸法性，如微塵許悉無所見。	謂諸菩薩以聖慧眼得見諸法，於中入解，乃至菩提道場觀諸法性，如微塵許悉無所見。	It means that the bodhisattvas, with the eye of holy wisdom, see all dharmas, understand them, and up to the terrace of enlightenment, contemplate the nature of dharmas, not seeing even a particle.
['ZH_T11_0316_037:0877a26_10']	若空解脫即無相解脫、無願解脫、不起解脫、無生解脫、無作解脫、無性解脫、緣生解脫，而諸菩薩於一切法應如是觀。	若空解脫即無相解脫、無願解脫、不起解脫、無生解脫、無作解脫、無性解脫、緣生解脫，而諸菩薩於一切法應如是觀。	If the liberation of emptiness is the liberation of signlessness, the liberation of wishlessness, the liberation of non-arising, the liberation of non-birth, the liberation of non-action, the liberation of non-nature, and the liberation of conditioned arising, then the bodhisattvas should contemplate all dharmas in this way.

They transcend the Dharma of liberation and the path to bodhi, attain unobstructed liberation, and do not give rise to the thought of great compassion that views sentient beings with affection.

['ZH_T11_0316_037:0877b10_1']	如是念處諸法平等，猶如虛空。	如是念處諸法平等，猶如虛空。	In this way, the mindfulness of dharmas is equal, just like empty space.

One does not delight in the dharmas of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, but is determined to abide in the mindfulness of the buddhas, never forgetting or being confused, up to the final limit of dharmas. The mindfulness of dharmas is able to expound the immeasurable, uncommon realm, equally penetrating and understanding all buddha-dharmas, causing sentient beings' minds to be filled with joy, naturally understanding all buddha-dharmas.
