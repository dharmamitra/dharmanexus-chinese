The bodhisattvas in the five abodes eliminate desire and love, extinguish the unwholesome roots, and abide in the desire realm. They uphold the receptivity to suffering and contemplate the root of suffering with wisdom. In the formless realm, the formless body cannot contemplate the rootlessness of suffering. Therefore, the bodhisattvas do not eliminate the dharmas of the desire realm in the formless realm. There are ninety unwholesome roots, and the medicine of uncontaminated wisdom also has ninety. Using the ten essential dharmas, they counter the unwholesome roots and the subtle defilements of desire and love in the desire realm. The remaining eighty dharmas eliminate the eighty unwholesome fundamental roots, although they are not completely exhausted, they are gradually made subtle.
