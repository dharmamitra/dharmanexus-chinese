['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a09_0']	唐海東新羅國沙門元曉述	唐海東新羅國沙門元曉述	001	Expounded by the Tang Dynasty Monk Wonhyo of the Kingdom of Silla in the East
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a10_0']	將釋此經，三門分別：初述大意；次釋經宗致；	將釋此經，三門分別：初述大意；次釋經宗致；	001	In explaining this sūtra, there are three aspects to be distinguished: First, stating the general meaning; second, explaining the purport of the sūtra;
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a11_9']	其第三者，則入文釋。	其第三者，則入文釋。	001	The third is entering the text and explaining it.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a13_11']	第一述大意者，夫眾生心之為心也，離相離性如海如空，如空之故無相不融，何有東西之處？	第一述大意者，夫眾生心之為心也，離相離性如海如空，如空之故無相不融，何有東西之處？	001	As for the first, stating the general meaning, the mind of sentient beings is a mind that is free from characteristics and nature, like the ocean and like the sky. Because it is like the sky, there are no characteristics that are not merged, so how can there be a place of east and west?
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a14_8']	如海之故無性是守，豈無動靜之時？	如海之故無性是守，豈無動靜之時？	001	Because it is like the ocean, there is no nature that is not preserved, so how can there be a time without movement and stillness?
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a15_2']	爾乃或因染業，隨五濁而長流；	爾乃或因染業，隨五濁而長流；	001	Then, it may be due to defiled karma, following the five turbidities and flowing for a long time;
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a15_14']	或承淨緣，絕四流而永寂。	或承淨緣，絕四流而永寂。	001	Or relying on pure conditions, cutting off the four streams and eternally still.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a16_12']	若斯動靜皆是大夢，以覺望之無流無寂。	若斯動靜皆是大夢，以覺望之無流無寂。	001	Such movement and stillness are all great dreams, viewed from the perspective of awakening there is no flowing and no stillness.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a18_11']	穢土淨國本來一心，生死涅槃終無二際，然無二之覺取之良難，迷一之夢去之不易。	穢土淨國本來一心，生死涅槃終無二際，然無二之覺取之良難，迷一之夢去之不易。	001	The defiled land and the pure country are originally one mind, and birth and death and nirvāṇa ultimately have no two ends. However, the realization of non-duality is truly difficult, and the dream of being deluded about the one is not easily removed.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a20_11']	所以大聖垂迹有遐有邇，所陳言教或褒或貶，至如牟尼善逝現此穢土，誡五濁而勸往；	所以大聖垂迹有遐有邇，所陳言教或褒或貶，至如牟尼善逝現此穢土，誡五濁而勸往；	001	Therefore, the Great Sage manifested traces, some far and some near, and the teachings he presented were either exalted or depreciated. As for the Muni and Sugata appearing in this defiled land, they admonished the five turbidities and encouraged going [to the Pure Land];
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a21_8']	彌陀如來御彼淨國，引三輩而導生。	彌陀如來御彼淨國，引三輩而導生。	001	Amitâbha Tathāgata governs that pure country, leading the three classes and guiding beings to be born there.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a23_5']	今是經者，斯乃兩尊出世之大意，四輩入道之要門，示淨土之可願、讚妙德而可歸。	今是經者，斯乃兩尊出世之大意，四輩入道之要門，示淨土之可願、讚妙德而可歸。	001	This sūtra is precisely the great intention of the two Honored Ones appearing in the world, and the essential gateway for the four groups to enter the Way. It shows that the Pure Land is worth aspiring to and praises the wonderful virtues that are worth returning to.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348a25_10']	妙德可歸者，耳聞經名則入一乘而無反，口誦佛號則出三界而不還，何況禮拜專念讚詠觀察者哉！	妙德可歸者，耳聞經名則入一乘而無反，口誦佛號則出三界而不還，何況禮拜專念讚詠觀察者哉！	001	As for the wonderful virtues that are worth returning to, if one hears the name of the sūtra, one will enter the One Vehicle without turning back; if one recites the Buddha's name, one will leave the three realms without returning. How much more so for those who pay homage, single-mindedly contemplate, praise, and observe!
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b01_17']	淨土可願者，浴於金妙蓮池則離有生之染因，遊玉樹檀林則向無死之聖果，加復見佛光入無相、聞梵響悟無生，然後乃從第五門出，回轡生死之苑、憩煩惱之林，不從一步普遊十方世界，不舒一念遍現無邊三世，其為樂也可勝度乎！	淨土可願者，浴於金妙蓮池則離有生之染因，遊玉樹檀林則向無死之聖果，加復見佛光入無相、聞梵響悟無生，然後乃從第五門出，回轡生死之苑、憩煩惱之林，不從一步普遊十方世界，不舒一念遍現無邊三世，其為樂也可勝度乎！	001	As for the Pure Land being worth aspiring to, bathing in the golden, wondrous lotus pond is to be free from the defiled causes of birth and existence, wandering in the sandalwood forest of jade trees is to head towards the holy fruit of immortality. Moreover, seeing the Buddha's light enter the signless and hearing the Brahma sounds awaken to non-arising, then one can emerge from the fifth gate, turn the reins in the garden of birth and death, and rest in the forest of afflictions. Without taking a single step, one can universally roam the worlds of the ten directions, without extending a single thought, one can manifest the boundless three times. Can the joy of this surpass the joy of liberation?
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b02_7']	極樂之稱豈虛也哉！	極樂之稱豈虛也哉！	001	How can the name Land of Ultimate Bliss be false?
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b03_6']	言「佛說」者，從金口之所出，千代不刊之教。	言「佛說」者，從金口之所出，千代不刊之教。	001	As for saying spoken by the Buddha, it comes from the golden mouth, the teachings that will not be erased for a thousand generations.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b05_6']	「阿彌陀」者，含實德之所立，萬劫無盡之名，能所合舉以標題目，故言「佛說阿彌陀經」也。	「阿彌陀」者，含實德之所立，萬劫無盡之名，能所合舉以標題目，故言「佛說阿彌陀經」也。	001	Amitābha is established based on the true virtues, the name that will never end for ten thousand kalpas. Combining the doer and the deed, it is used to title the text, thus it says The Sutra Spoken by the Buddha on Amitābha.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b07_10']	第二辨經宗致者，此經直以超過三界二種清淨以為其宗，令諸眾生於無上道得不退轉以為意致。	第二辨經宗致者，此經直以超過三界二種清淨以為其宗，令諸眾生於無上道得不退轉以為意致。	001	Second, in discerning the main purport of the sūtra, this sūtra directly takes the two kinds of purity that transcend the three realms as its main purport, and takes the non-retrogression of sentient beings from the unsurpassed path as its intended meaning.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b08_1']	何者名為二種清淨？	何者名為二種清淨？	001	What is called the two kinds of purity?
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b08_13']	如論說言，此清淨有二種：	如論說言，此清淨有二種：	001	As the treatise says, this purity is of two kinds:
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b09_1']	一者、器世間清淨；	一者、器世間清淨；	001	First, the purity of the vessel world;
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b09_17']	二者、眾生世間清淨，乃至廣說故。	二者、眾生世間清淨，乃至廣說故。	001	Second, the purity of the sentient beings' world, and so forth.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b10_6']	然入此清淨有其四門：	然入此清淨有其四門：	001	However, there are four approaches to entering this purity:
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b11_9']	一、圓滿門，唯佛如來得入此門，如《本業經》說；	一、圓滿門，唯佛如來得入此門，如《本業經》說；	001	First, the perfect approach, which only the Buddha Tathāgatas can enter, as stated in the Benye Sutra;
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b12_12']	二、一向門，八地已上菩薩得入此門，如《攝大乘論》說；	二、一向門，八地已上菩薩得入此門，如《攝大乘論》說；	001	Second, the one-sided approach, which only Bodhisattvas on the eighth ground and above can enter, as stated in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha;
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b14_1']	三、純淨門，唯有第三極歡喜地已上菩薩得入此門，如《解深密經》說；	三、純淨門，唯有第三極歡喜地已上菩薩得入此門，如《解深密經》說；	001	Third, the pure approach, which only Bodhisattvas on the third ground of Extreme Joy and above can enter, as stated in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra;
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b15_11']	四、正定聚門，唯無退者得入此門，無邪定聚及不定聚，如兩卷經說。	四、正定聚門，唯無退者得入此門，無邪定聚及不定聚，如兩卷經說。	001	Fourth, the gate of the assembly of those with right concentration, only those without retrogression can enter this gate, there are no those with wrong concentration or those with indeterminate concentration, as the two-fascicle sūtra explains.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b16_3']	通論極樂世界，具此四門。	通論極樂世界，具此四門。	001	In general, the Land of Ultimate Bliss is endowed with these four gates.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b17_14']	今此經宗二種清淨，正示第四正定聚門不定聲聞及說凡夫亦得生故。	今此經宗二種清淨，正示第四正定聚門不定聲聞及說凡夫亦得生故。	001	The main purport of this sūtra, with its two kinds of purity, correctly demonstrates the fourth gate of the assembly of those with right concentration, because it explains that even ordinary beings can be born there, not to mention the indeterminate śrāvakas.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b18_13']	論說二乘種不生，決定種性不得生故。	論說二乘種不生，決定種性不得生故。	001	The treatise states that the two vehicles are not born there because those of fixed spiritual lineage cannot be born there.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b18_20']	《聲王經》說：	《聲王經》說：	001	The Sūtra of the King of Sound states:
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b20_1']	安樂世界阿彌陀佛有父母者，是變化女非實報女。	安樂世界阿彌陀佛有父母者，是變化女非實報女。	001	The Buddha Amitābha of the Land of Bliss has parents, but these are transformation females, not real reward females.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b21_4']	論說女人不生彼者，無實女故，知變鳥此亦如是故。	論說女人不生彼者，無實女故，知變鳥此亦如是故。	001	The treatise states that women are not born there because there are no real women. It should be known that the transformed birds are also like this.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b22_5']	又復雖有父母而非胎生，寔是化生假為父母。	又復雖有父母而非胎生，寔是化生假為父母。	001	Moreover, even though there are parents, they are not born from the womb, but are truly born by transformation, and only provisionally have parents.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b22_10']	如彼經言：	如彼經言：	001	As that sūtra says:
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b25_3']	若四眾能正受彼佛之名號，以此功德，臨命終時阿彌陀佛，即與大眾往此人所令其得見，見已尋生慶悅倍增功德。	若四眾能正受彼佛之名號，以此功德，臨命終時阿彌陀佛，即與大眾往此人所令其得見，見已尋生慶悅倍增功德。	001	If the four assemblies are able to properly receive the name of that Buddha, with this merit, when their life is about to end, Amitâbha Buddha will go to that person together with the great assembly, causing them to see, and upon seeing, they will immediately give rise to joy, and their merit will be greatly increased.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b27_14']	以是因緣，所生之處永離胞胎穢欲之形，純處鮮妙寶蓮華中自然化生，具大神通光明赫奕，當知父母假寄之耳。	以是因緣，所生之處永離胞胎穢欲之形，純處鮮妙寶蓮華中自然化生，具大神通光明赫奕，當知父母假寄之耳。	001	By these causes and conditions, wherever they are reborn, they will forever leave behind the defiled body of the womb and desire, and purely dwell in a wonderful jeweled lotus flower, naturally born by transformation, with great spiritual powers and radiant light. One should know that the parents are merely a temporary entrustment.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b27_19']	又彼經言：	又彼經言：	001	Moreover, that sūtra says:
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348b29_18']	阿彌陀佛與聲聞俱，如來、應供、正遍知其國號曰清泰，聖王所住，其城縱廣十千由旬。	阿彌陀佛與聲聞俱，如來、應供、正遍知其國號曰清泰，聖王所住，其城縱廣十千由旬。	001	Amitâbha Buddha is together with the śrāvakas, the Tathāgata, the Worthy of Offerings, the Perfectly Enlightened One. His country is called Pure and Peaceful, the abode of the Sage King. The city is ten thousand yojanas long and wide.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c01_5']	而《觀經》說：	而《觀經》說：	001	The Guanjing (Contemplation Sūtra) says:
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c04_8']	彼佛身高六十萬億那由他恒河沙由旬，城小身大不相當者，當知彼佛有眾多城，隨眾大小城亦大小，大城之中示以大身，小城之中現以小身。	彼佛身高六十萬億那由他恒河沙由旬，城小身大不相當者，當知彼佛有眾多城，隨眾大小城亦大小，大城之中示以大身，小城之中現以小身。	001	The height of that Buddha is 600,000 koṭīs of nayutas of Ganges sands of yojanas. The city is small but the body is large, not corresponding. One should know that Buddha has many cities, and according to the size of the assembly, the city is also large or small. In the large city, he shows a large body, and in the small city, he manifests a small body.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c05_16']	《聲王經》十千由旬者，是與聲聞俱住之城，當知佛身相當而住。	《聲王經》十千由旬者，是與聲聞俱住之城，當知佛身相當而住。	001	The ten thousand yojanas mentioned in the Sūtra of the Sound King are the city where he dwells together with the śrāvakas. One should know that the Buddha's body is proportionate to the city.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c07_5']	《觀經》所說身高大者，當知其城亦隨廣大，與諸大眾俱住處故。	《觀經》所說身高大者，當知其城亦隨廣大，與諸大眾俱住處故。	001	The height of the Buddha's body mentioned in the Contemplation Sūtra should be known to be the city where he dwells together with the great assembly.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c09_14']	如兩卷經及此經中，池中蓮華大小懸殊，隨池有大小其華亦大小，當知城身大小亦爾，其餘相違準此而通。	如兩卷經及此經中，池中蓮華大小懸殊，隨池有大小其華亦大小，當知城身大小亦爾，其餘相違準此而通。	001	Just as the lotus flowers in the two-fascicle sūtra and this sūtra are vastly different in size, according to the size of the pond, the flowers are also large or small. One should know that the size of the city and the body is also like this. The other discrepancies should be understood according to this.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c10_16']	或說，《聲王經》中說有父母，是顯彼佛所住穢土。	或說，《聲王經》中說有父母，是顯彼佛所住穢土。	001	It is said that in the Sūtra of the Sound King, there are parents, which shows that the Buddha dwells in a defiled land.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c11_1']	是義不然。	是義不然。	001	This interpretation is not correct.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c12_8']	所以然者，彼經既說，寶蓮華中自然化生，具大神通光明赫奕。	所以然者，彼經既說，寶蓮華中自然化生，具大神通光明赫奕。	001	The reason is this: since that sutra says that one is spontaneously born in a jeweled lotus flower, endowed with great spiritual powers and radiant light,
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c12_17']	又下文言有二菩薩：	又下文言有二菩薩：	001	and the text below says there are two bodhisattvas:
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c13_4']	一、名觀世音；	一、名觀世音；	001	one named Avalokitêśvara;
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c13_11']	二、名大勢至。	二、名大勢至。	001	two, named Mahāsthāmaprāpta.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c14_19']	此二菩薩侍立左右，此等悉是淨土相故，不異《觀經》之所說故。	此二菩薩侍立左右，此等悉是淨土相故，不異《觀經》之所說故。	001	These two bodhisattvas stand to the left and right, these are all the characteristics of the Pure Land, because they are not different from what is said in the Contemplation Sutra.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c17_12']	當知彼經所說提婆達多及魔王等，悉於淨土變化所作，不由此等為非淨土，如化畜生非穢土故，且止乘論還釋本文。	當知彼經所說提婆達多及魔王等，悉於淨土變化所作，不由此等為非淨土，如化畜生非穢土故，且止乘論還釋本文。	001	One should know that the Devadatta and Māra kings spoken of in that sutra are all created by transformation in the Pure Land, not because of these being impure lands, just as transformed animals are not defiled lands. Let us stop discussing the vehicle and return to explaining the main text.
['ZH_T37_1759_001:0348c18_1']	此下第三入文解釋。	此下第三入文解釋。	001	Below this is the third section, explaining the text.

Therefore it is said that one is not born in that land through the causes and conditions of a small amount of wholesome roots and merit.

This meaning correctly says that although those born in that land are of nine grades, they are all equal in the wholesome roots of arousing the mind of enlightenment in the Great Vehicle, and therefore they are all without the name of reproach.

It is precisely because the seeds of the previously aroused great mind are not lost that one is able to take them as causes to be born in that land, but the presently practiced mind of the great vehicle regresses, so one is born in that land and attains the lesser fruit.
