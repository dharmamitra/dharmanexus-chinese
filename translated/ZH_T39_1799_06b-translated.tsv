Its essence is originally coarse and its nature is obstructive, unable to be clear and penetrating. How can this unclear and non-penetrating dharma be used to attain perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c12_4']	二、聲境。	二、聲境。	2. The Realm of Sound.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c14_3']	「音聲雜語言，但伊名句味，一非含一切，云何獲圓通？	「音聲雜語言，但伊名句味，一非含一切，云何獲圓通？	Sound is mixed with language, merely names, phrases, and flavors, each not containing all. How can it attain perfect penetration?

['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c21_13']	」香嚴童子宴晦清齋，聞香入鼻，觀此無生，來無所從、去無所至。	」香嚴童子宴晦清齋，聞香入鼻，觀此無生，來無所從、去無所至。	The youth Fragrant Adornment quietly contemplated in the Pure Abode. Smelling fragrances entering the nose, he observed their non-arising, coming from nowhere and going nowhere.

['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c23_11']	四、味境。	四、味境。	Fourth, the sense of taste.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c25_3']	「味性非本然，要以味時有，其覺不恒一，云何獲圓通？	「味性非本然，要以味時有，其覺不恒一，云何獲圓通？	The nature of taste is not originally so. It is only when tasting that it exists. Its perception is not always the same. How can it lead to perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c26_8']	」藥王、藥上因嘗眾味，了味無生，非即身心，非離身心。	」藥王、藥上因嘗眾味，了味無生，非即身心，非離身心。	Yaowang and Yaoshang, while tasting various flavors, realized that flavors have no origin, are neither the body and mind, nor separate from the body and mind.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c26_18']	由味覺明，位登菩薩。	由味覺明，位登菩薩。	By the clear awareness of flavors, they attained the stage of bodhisattvas.

['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c28_1']	味性本無，待根方覺，無根無味，故非圓通。	味性本無，待根方覺，無根無味，故非圓通。	The nature of flavors is originally non-existent, and is only cognized in dependence on the faculties. Without the faculties, there are no flavors. Therefore, it is not a gateway to perfect penetration.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c28_9']	味時者，嘗時也。	味時者，嘗時也。	The time of flavors refers to the time of tasting.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0908c28_14']	五、觸境。	五、觸境。	Fifth, the object of touch.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a01_3']	「觸以所觸明，無所不明觸，合離性非定，云何獲圓通？	「觸以所觸明，無所不明觸，合離性非定，云何獲圓通？	Touch is manifested by what is touched. There is nothing that is not touched. The nature of contact and separation is not definite. How can it lead to perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a03_2']	」跋陀婆羅忽悟水因，既不洗塵，亦不洗體，中間安然得無所有，妙觸宣明，由是證果。	」跋陀婆羅忽悟水因，既不洗塵，亦不洗體，中間安然得無所有，妙觸宣明，由是證果。	Baluopoluo suddenly realized the cause of water. Since it does not wash away dust, nor does it wash the body, in the middle, he peacefully attained the absence of anything, and the wonderful touch was clearly manifested, thereby realizing the fruit.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a04_11']	今明此觸因所觸身而得顯發，無所不顯，性非常定，故不圓通。	今明此觸因所觸身而得顯發，無所不顯，性非常定，故不圓通。	Now it is explained that this touch is manifested by the body that is touched, and there is nothing that is not manifested. The nature is not permanently fixed, so it is not a gateway to perfect penetration.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a04_16']	六、法境。	六、法境。	Sixth, the object of dharmas.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a06_3']	「法稱為內塵，憑塵必有所，能所非遍涉，云何獲圓通？	「法稱為內塵，憑塵必有所，能所非遍涉，云何獲圓通？	The Dharma is called the inner dust. Relying on the dust, there must be something. The subject and object do not pervade everywhere. How can it lead to perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a07_17']	」摩訶迦葉因觀世間六塵變壞，唯以空寂修於滅盡，妙法宣明，銷滅諸漏。	」摩訶迦葉因觀世間六塵變壞，唯以空寂修於滅盡，妙法宣明，銷滅諸漏。	Mahākāśyapa, because of observing the six dusts of the world changing and decaying, only cultivated extinction through emptiness and tranquility, and the wonderful Dharma was revealed, eliminating all defilements.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a09_14']	今揀雖稱妙法，乃是內塵，憑仗此修，豈越能所，覺非能所，故非圓通，遍圓涉通也。	今揀雖稱妙法，乃是內塵，憑仗此修，豈越能所，覺非能所，故非圓通，遍圓涉通也。	Now, although it is called the wonderful Dharma, it is the inner dust. Relying on this cultivation, how can it transcend the subject and object? Enlightenment is not the subject and object, so it is not perfect penetration, which means pervasively and perfectly penetrating through.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a10_4']	二、依根證入門，五：	二、依根證入門，五：	2. The five approaches of the gate of evidence based on the faculties:
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a10_9']	一、眼根。	一、眼根。	1. The eye faculty.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a12_3']	「見性雖洞然，明前不明後，四維虧一半，云何獲圓通？	「見性雖洞然，明前不明後，四維虧一半，云何獲圓通？	Although the nature of seeing is penetrating, it is bright in front but not behind. The four corners are missing half. How can it lead to perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a13_8']	」阿那律陀因修樂見照明三昧，旋見循元，由斯得證。	」阿那律陀因修樂見照明三昧，旋見循元，由斯得證。	Aniruddha, because of cultivating the samādhi of joyfully seeing illumination, revolving the seeing and returning to the origin, thus he attained evidence.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a15_12']	今云見性雖有洞然照了之義，而又前方全明，後方全暗，左右傍觀三分之二，故云四維虧一半也。	今云見性雖有洞然照了之義，而又前方全明，後方全暗，左右傍觀三分之二，故云四維虧一半也。	Now it is said that although the nature of seeing has the meaning of being completely illuminating, the front is completely bright while the back is completely dark, and when viewed from the sides, two-thirds are obscured, therefore it is said that half of the four directions is missing.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a15_17']	二、鼻根。	二、鼻根。	Second, the nose faculty.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a17_3']	「鼻息出入通，現前無交氣，支離匪涉入，云何獲圓通？	「鼻息出入通，現前無交氣，支離匪涉入，云何獲圓通？	The breath coming in and out is unobstructed, with no mingling of the exhaled and inhaled air in the present moment. The branches are separated and do not interpenetrate - how can it lead to perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a18_13']	」周利槃特因作數息，微細窮盡生住異滅，返息循空，因是得道。	」周利槃特因作數息，微細窮盡生住異滅，返息循空，因是得道。	Because Zhouli Pandi focused on counting the breath, he exhaustively reached the arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing of subtle and fine [breaths]. Reversing the breath and following emptiness, he thereby attained the Way.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a20_1']	今云鼻息雖通出入，出入各據而不相交，支分既離，豈成圓觀。	今云鼻息雖通出入，出入各據而不相交，支分既離，豈成圓觀。	Now it is said that although the breath coming in and out is unobstructed, the exhaled and inhaled [breaths] each occupy their own place and do not mingle, and since the branches are separated, how can it form a perfect observation?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a20_6']	三、舌根。	三、舌根。	Third, the tongue faculty.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a22_3']	「舌非入無端，因味生覺了，味亡了無有，云何獲圓通？	「舌非入無端，因味生覺了，味亡了無有，云何獲圓通？	The tongue is not a sense organ without a basis. It gives rise to awareness due to taste. When taste is gone, awareness also ceases to exist - how can it lead to perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a23_8']	」憍梵鉢提觀味之知非體非物，還味旋知，成無學果。	」憍梵鉢提觀味之知非體非物，還味旋知，成無學果。	Because Gaojian Botti observed that the awareness of taste is neither the substance nor the object, he returned the taste to the awareness and attained the fruit of no more learning.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a24_19']	今云舌入非是無端自有，由味、境合方有覺知，境滅知亡，未為通貫。	今云舌入非是無端自有，由味、境合方有覺知，境滅知亡，未為通貫。	Now it is said that the tongue faculty is not without basis, but arises from the combination of taste and object, and only then is there awareness. When the object ceases, awareness is lost, and this is not yet all-pervading.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a25_4']	四、身根。	四、身根。	Fourth, the body faculty.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a27_3']	「身與所觸同，各非圓覺觀，涯量不冥會，云何獲圓通？	「身與所觸同，各非圓覺觀，涯量不冥會，云何獲圓通？	The body and what it touches are the same, each not a perfect enlightened observation. The limits and extent do not merge and unite. How can it attain perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909a28_14']	」畢陵伽婆蹉因觀痛覺，覺清淨心無覺無痛，遺身純覺，獲無學果。	」畢陵伽婆蹉因觀痛覺，覺清淨心無覺無痛，遺身純覺，獲無學果。	Pilindavatsa, because of observing painful awareness, realized the pure mind without awareness and without pain, and his body became pure awareness, attaining the fruit of no-more-learning.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b02_3']	今云能覺身根與所覺觸互相假有，各無自性，義例相類，俱非圓觀，知無知異各有涯量，互不相冥，故為所揀。	今云能覺身根與所覺觸互相假有，各無自性，義例相類，俱非圓觀，知無知異各有涯量，互不相冥，故為所揀。	Now it is said that the able-to-know body faculty and the known touches mutually depend on each other and each lacks self-nature. The meaning and examples are similar. They are both not perfect observations. Knowing and not knowing are different and each has limits and extent. They do not mutually merge, and therefore are rejected.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b02_8']	五、意根。	五、意根。	Fifth, the mind faculty.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b04_3']	「知根雜亂思，湛了終無見，想念不可脫，云何獲圓通？	「知根雜亂思，湛了終無見，想念不可脫，云何獲圓通？	The knowing faculty is mixed with chaotic thoughts. In deep clarity, there is ultimately no seeing. Thoughts and ideas cannot be escaped. How can it attain perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b06_6']	」須菩提曠劫已來心得無礙，由是觀察十方成空，空性圓明，頓入如來寶明空海，同佛知見。	」須菩提曠劫已來心得無礙，由是觀察十方成空，空性圓明，頓入如來寶明空海，同佛知見。	Subhuti, for a long time, has attained unobstructed mind. Based on this, he observes the ten directions as empty, and the nature of emptiness is perfectly bright. He suddenly enters the treasure-like bright empty ocean of the Tathagata, and shares the Buddha's knowledge and insight.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b07_9']	今謂意根雜亂思念，若以寂定湛旋，畢竟無有知見。	今謂意根雜亂思念，若以寂定湛旋，畢竟無有知見。	Now he says that the mind faculty is mixed with chaotic thoughts. If one uses tranquil concentration to return to the stillness, there will ultimately be no knowledge or insight.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b07_19']	依此修行，想念何逃？	依此修行，想念何逃？	Relying on this practice, how can thoughts escape?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b09_10']	亦可若望湛覺真明，必無知見，即無知覺明也，應知有知見者未脫妄想。	亦可若望湛覺真明，必無知見，即無知覺明也，應知有知見者未脫妄想。	It can also be said that if one looks to the tranquil awareness of true brightness, there must be no knowledge or insight, which is the bright awareness without knowledge. One should know that those who have knowledge and insight have not yet escaped from conceptual thoughts.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b09_20']	三、依識修斷門，六：	三、依識修斷門，六：	3. The door of cultivation and elimination based on consciousness, in six parts:
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b10_4']	一、眼識。	一、眼識。	1. Eye consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b12_3']	「識見雜三和，詰本稱非相，自體先無定，云何獲圓通？	「識見雜三和，詰本稱非相，自體先無定，云何獲圓通？	Consciousness sees mixed with the three unities. When questioned, it is called non-appearance. The self-nature originally has no fixed state. How can it attain perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b13_12']	」舍利弗曠劫已來心見清淨，由遇佛故，見覺明圓，光極知見。	」舍利弗曠劫已來心見清淨，由遇佛故，見覺明圓，光極知見。	For a long time, Shariputra's mind and vision have been pure. Because he encountered the Buddha, his vision and awareness are perfectly bright, and his light reaches knowledge and insight.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b15_2']	今揀眼識雜在三和之內，窮其本性無相可得，自體不常，如何圓遍。	今揀眼識雜在三和之內，窮其本性無相可得，自體不常，如何圓遍。	Now, distinguishing the eye consciousness mixed within the three unities, exhausting its fundamental nature, no characteristics can be obtained. Its own body is not constant, how can it be perfect and pervasive?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b15_7']	二、耳識。	二、耳識。	Second, the ear consciousness.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b17_4']	「心聞洞十方，生于大因力，初心不能入，云何獲圓通？	「心聞洞十方，生于大因力，初心不能入，云何獲圓通？	The mind-hearing penetrates the ten directions, born from the power of great causes. Beginners cannot enter it, how can it be perfect and penetrating?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b18_9']	」普賢菩薩本用心聞，分別眾生所有知見，得大自在。	」普賢菩薩本用心聞，分別眾生所有知見，得大自在。	Samantabhadra Bodhisattva originally used mind-hearing to distinguish the knowledge and views possessed by sentient beings and attained great freedom.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b21_3']	今揀太高，收機不盡，既法界為體，心聞為用，故洞十方，此由普賢因修大行之所感，故中下之機於斯絕分，故云不能入。	今揀太高，收機不盡，既法界為體，心聞為用，故洞十方，此由普賢因修大行之所感，故中下之機於斯絕分，故云不能入。	Now, distinguishing it as too lofty, not fully encompassing the capacities, since the Dharma realm is the essence and mind-hearing is the function, therefore it penetrates the ten directions. This is due to Samantabhadra's cultivation of great practices in the past, therefore those of middling and lower capacities have no share in this, therefore it is said that they cannot enter.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b22_10']	以眾生心中發明普賢行者方現其身，非同觀音觸物隨現。	以眾生心中發明普賢行者方現其身，非同觀音觸物隨現。	Only those who give rise to the practice of Samantabhadra in the minds of sentient beings will manifest his body, not the same as Avalokitesvara who appears in response to all things.

['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b24_3']	「鼻想本權機，秖令攝心住，住成心所住，云何獲圓通？	「鼻想本權機，秖令攝心住，住成心所住，云何獲圓通？	The thought of the nose is originally a skillful means, only to make the mind concentrate and abide. Abiding becomes what the mind abides in, how can it attain perfect penetration?
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b25_18']	」孫陀羅難陀觀鼻端白，見出入息化為光明，身心內明，圓洞世界遍成空淨。	」孫陀羅難陀觀鼻端白，見出入息化為光明，身心內明，圓洞世界遍成空淨。	Sundarananda observed the white tip of the nose, and saw the exhaled and inhaled breath transform into light, with the body and mind internally illuminated, and the entire world becoming pure emptiness.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b26_12']	今揀觀鼻非為究竟，故云權機。	今揀觀鼻非為究竟，故云權機。	Now, the observation of the nose is not considered ultimate, so it is said to be a skillful means.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b27_12']	若令攝心，必成所住，真元無住，所住便非。	若令攝心，必成所住，真元無住，所住便非。	If one is made to concentrate the mind, it will certainly become what it abides in. The true origin is originally without abiding, and what is abided in is then not it.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909b28_3']	經云「若心有住則為非住。	經云「若心有住則為非住。	The sutra says, If the mind has abiding, then it is not abiding.

['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909c02_7']	」富樓那辯才無礙，祕密法門微妙開示，得無所畏。	」富樓那辯才無礙，祕密法門微妙開示，得無所畏。	Purna's eloquence is unobstructed, and he subtly reveals the secret Dharma gates, attaining fearlessness.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909c03_16']	今揀說法不離聲名句文，所開悟人須先成熟，不由無種便能入道。	今揀說法不離聲名句文，所開悟人須先成熟，不由無種便能入道。	Now, speaking Dharma is not apart from sounds, names, phrases, and sentences. Those who are enlightened must be already accomplished, and cannot enter the Way by having no seeds.
['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909c04_12']	若散心說，但成有漏，非曰圓通。	若散心說，但成有漏，非曰圓通。	If one speaks with a distracted mind, one only achieves contaminated [attainments], not perfect penetration.

['ZH_T39_1799_06b:0909c06_3']	「持犯但束身，非身無所束，元非遍一切，云何獲圓通？	「持犯但束身，非身無所束，元非遍一切，云何獲圓通？	Observing precepts only restrains the body, without the body there is nothing to restrain, originally not pervading everywhere, how can it achieve perfect penetration?
