['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b12_13']	《瑜伽》云「前地雖能多住無相作意，而未能令無相作意無間無缺，多修習住為令滿故，次有此來。	《瑜伽》云「前地雖能多住無相作意，而未能令無相作意無間無缺，多修習住為令滿故，次有此來。	The Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra says, Although one is able to abide in the intention of signlessness in the previous ground, one is still unable to make the intention of signlessness uninterrupted and complete, and to abide in much cultivation. In order to fulfill it, this [ground] comes next.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b13_7']	」又前功用未滿，今令滿故。	」又前功用未滿，今令滿故。	Moreover, the previous effort has not been fulfilled, and now it is to be fulfilled.

['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b15_17']	」此有三義，同於本分，已如前釋。	」此有三義，同於本分，已如前釋。	This has three meanings, the same as in the original chapter, already explained above.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b17_10']	《解深密》云「能遠證入無缺無間無相作意，與清淨地共相隣接，故名遠行。	《解深密》云「能遠證入無缺無間無相作意，與清淨地共相隣接，故名遠行。	The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra says, Able to enter far and deeply, without interruption or gaps, with a non-conceptualized mind, neighboring the pure grounds, it is called far-reaching.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b17_16']	」此有二義：	」此有二義：	This has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b18_14']	初義即三中無相，揀異前地，云無間缺；	初義即三中無相，揀異前地，云無間缺；	The first meaning is the non-conceptualization among the three, distinguishing it from the previous ground, saying it is without interruption or gaps;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b19_8']	後義由隣後地，即能遠去故。	後義由隣後地，即能遠去故。	The latter meaning is because it neighbors the subsequent ground, it is able to go far.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b20_2']	故下經云「二界中間此能過故。	故下經云「二界中間此能過故。	Therefore, the sūtra below says, Because it can transcend the middle of the two realms.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b20_11']	」亦是前行、後遠。	」亦是前行、後遠。	It is also the previous practice and the subsequent distance.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b21_8']	《攝大乘》云至功用行最後邊者，但是一義。	《攝大乘》云至功用行最後邊者，但是一義。	The Mahāyānasaṃgraha says it is the final limit of applied practices, which is just one meaning.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b23_11']	世親釋云「雖一切相不能動搖，而於無相猶名有行者，此解功用之言，謂起功用住無相故。	世親釋云「雖一切相不能動搖，而於無相猶名有行者，此解功用之言，謂起功用住無相故。	Vasubandhu's commentary says, Although all characteristics cannot move or shake it, it is still called practice within non-characteristics. This explains the word 'applied.' It means giving rise to applied practices and abiding in non-characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b24_18']	」《金光明經》同《深密》初義，《莊嚴論》中同《深密》後義。	」《金光明經》同《深密》初義，《莊嚴論》中同《深密》後義。	The Suvarṇa-prabhāsa-sūtra has the same meaning as the initial meaning in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, while the Suvarṇa-prabhāsa-vyākhyāna has the same meaning as the latter meaning in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b25_9']	雖有四義，然通有二義立遠行名：	雖有四義，然通有二義立遠行名：	Although there are four meanings, generally speaking there are two meanings for establishing the name Far-reaching:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b26_15']	一從前遠來至功用邊、二此功用行邊能遠去後位故。	一從前遠來至功用邊、二此功用行邊能遠去後位故。	The first is coming from far away in the past to the limit of effort; the second is being able to go far away to the subsequent stage from this limit of effort.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b27_18']	《十住論》云「去三界遠，近法王位，故名遠地。	《十住論》云「去三界遠，近法王位，故名遠地。	The Dasheng xichan yaozhi lun says: Going far away from the three realms, close to the position of the Dharma King, therefore it is called the Far-reaching Ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b28_10']	」《仁王》名遠達地者，亦通二義。	」《仁王》名遠達地者，亦通二義。	The Renwang jing calls it the Far-reaching Ground, which also encompasses both meanings.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814b29_4']	然其能遠去行，正是無相故。	然其能遠去行，正是無相故。	However, the practice of being able to go far away is precisely the characteristic of signlessness.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c01_7']	所離障離細相現行障，謂六地執生滅細相現行故。	所離障離細相現行障，謂六地執生滅細相現行故。	The obstacle to be eliminated is the obstacle of subtle characteristics appearing, which refers to the subtle characteristics of arising and ceasing grasped in the sixth ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c01_16']	此生滅相即是二愚：	此生滅相即是二愚：	These characteristics of arising and ceasing are precisely two kinds of delusion:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c02_16']	一細相現行愚，謂執有緣生流轉細生相故；	一細相現行愚，謂執有緣生流轉細生相故；	The first is the delusion of subtle characteristics appearing, which refers to grasping the subtle characteristics of arising in conditioned arising;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c03_16']	二純作意求無相愚，即執有細還滅相故。	二純作意求無相愚，即執有細還滅相故。	The second is the delusion of purely intending to seek signlessness, which refers to grasping the subtle characteristics of ceasing.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c05_8']	以純作意於無相勤求，未能空中起有勝行，至此地中方能斷之。	以純作意於無相勤求，未能空中起有勝行，至此地中方能斷之。	Because of purely intending to diligently seek signlessness, one is still unable to give rise to superior practices in emptiness. One is able to eliminate these [delusions] upon reaching this ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c09_7']	以常在無相故不執生，更不作意勤求無相，故能證得法無差別真如，以了種種教法同真無相故，以能空中起有勝行故成方便度，二行雙行乃至亦得無相之果。	以常在無相故不執生，更不作意勤求無相，故能證得法無差別真如，以了種種教法同真無相故，以能空中起有勝行故成方便度，二行雙行乃至亦得無相之果。	Because they are always in the signless, they do not grasp arising, and they do not intentionally diligently seek the signless, thus they are able to realize the suchness of the non-differentiation of dharmas, because they understand the various teachings to be the same as suchness and signless. Because they are able to give rise to superior practices in emptiness, they accomplish the perfection of skillful means. The two practices are practiced together, and they also attain the fruit of signlessness.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c10_7']	故知以純無相不礙起行，為此地別義。	故知以純無相不礙起行，為此地別義。	Therefore, know that using pure signlessness to unobstructedly give rise to practices is the distinct meaning of this ground.

['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c11_19']	前中分四：	前中分四：	Within the first, there are four parts:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c12_7']	初二天眾讚說主；	初二天眾讚說主；	The first two are the heavenly beings praising the speaker;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c13_5']	次一天主光雲供佛，表智契法身故；	次一天主光雲供佛，表智契法身故；	Next, one heavenly being uses light clouds as offerings to the Buddha, symbolizing the wisdom in accord with the Dharma body;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c13_14']	三有一頌天眾慶聞；	三有一頌天眾慶聞；	Third, there is one verse of the heavenly beings rejoicing in hearing;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c14_7']	四有六頌天女樂音讚佛。	四有六頌天女樂音讚佛。	Fourth, there are six verses of heavenly maidens using music to praise the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c15_5']	於中，初一顯聲因緣、餘五正顯讚詞。	於中，初一顯聲因緣、餘五正顯讚詞。	Within this, the first reveals the causes and conditions of the sound, and the remaining five directly reveal the words of praise.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c15_16']	於中，初四讚寂用無礙；	於中，初四讚寂用無礙；	Among them, the first four praise the unobstructedness of quiescence and function;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c17_3']	後一明起用所由，即悲智無礙將說雙行，故承力讚此。	後一明起用所由，即悲智無礙將說雙行，故承力讚此。	The last one clarifies the reason for the arising of function, which is the unobstructedness of compassion and wisdom. It will be explained that the two are practiced together, so the power is received and this is praised.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c17_8']	後請可知。	後請可知。	The request at the end can be understood.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c17_17']	第二正說分，中二：	第二正說分，中二：	The second part on the correct explanation is divided into two:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c18_2']	先行、後果。	先行、後果。	First, practice; second, fruition.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c18_11']	行中有五種相差別：	行中有五種相差別：	Within the practice, there are five kinds of distinctions:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c20_12']	一樂無作行對治差別、二彼障對治差別、三雙行勝差別、四前上地勝差別、五彼果差別。	一樂無作行對治差別、二彼障對治差別、三雙行勝差別、四前上地勝差別、五彼果差別。	First, the distinction of the practice of effortless counteraction; second, the distinction of the counteraction to its obstacles; third, the distinction of the supremacy of the two practices; fourth, the distinction of the supremacy of the higher grounds; fifth, the distinction of its fruition.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c21_8']	五中，初一是趣地方便，即當入心；	五中，初一是趣地方便，即當入心；	Among the five, the first is the expedient for entering the ground, which is the mind of entry;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c21_17']	餘四為住出心在果。	餘四為住出心在果。	The remaining four are for abiding and emerging, and are within the fruition.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c23_11']	又住中，初一即初住地、次一正住地、次一說雖在後義該始終、後一地滿。	又住中，初一即初住地、次一正住地、次一說雖在後義該始終、後一地滿。	Moreover, within abiding, the first is the initial abiding in the ground, the next one is the correct abiding in the ground, the next one is said to be in the latter but its meaning encompasses the beginning and end, and the last one is the completion of the ground.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c25_7']	初言樂無作者，樂著般若觀空故，即細相現行障，此地隨有不著為能對治；	初言樂無作者，樂著般若觀空故，即細相現行障，此地隨有不著為能對治；	The first says that there is no creator of pleasure, because one delights in prajñā and observes emptiness, which is the obstacle of subtle characteristics manifesting. This ground's non-attachment is the antidote.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c27_10']	二謂向雖能治前地樂空之心，以其有量有功用，即復是障故，修無量無功用行以為對治；	二謂向雖能治前地樂空之心，以其有量有功用，即復是障故，修無量無功用行以為對治；	The second says that although one can treat the previous ground's delight in emptiness, since it has measure and effort, it is again an obstacle, so one cultivates immeasurable and effortless practices as the antidote.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c28_3']	三垢障既盡故，止觀雙行；	三垢障既盡故，止觀雙行；	The third says that since the obstacles of defilements are exhausted, calming and insight are practiced together.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c29_6']	四明此地功用過前六地、勝後三地，上即後也；	四明此地功用過前六地、勝後三地，上即後也；	The fourth clarifies that the effort of this ground surpasses the previous six grounds and is superior to the latter three grounds, which is the latter part.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0814c29_17']	五由地滿故，說雙行果。	五由地滿故，說雙行果。	The fifth says that because the ground is fulfilled, the result of practicing together is spoken.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a01_4']	今初分中有四：	今初分中有四：	Now, the first part has four sections:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a03_3']	初結前標後、二「何等」下徵顯其相、三「菩薩以如是」下結行功能、四「入已」下彰其分齊。	初結前標後、二「何等」下徵顯其相、三「菩薩以如是」下結行功能、四「入已」下彰其分齊。	First, concluding the previous and introducing the next; second, from What are they? below, questioning and revealing its characteristics; third, from The bodhisattva, with such... below, concluding the function of the practice; fourth, from Having entered... below, demonstrating its extent.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a04_7']	今初，具足六地行已，即是結前義含所治無相行故。	今初，具足六地行已，即是結前義含所治無相行故。	Now, the first, having fulfilled the practices of the sixth ground, is concluding the previous meaning, which implicitly includes the practice of signlessness to be treated.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a05_7']	以般若無相行滿，於此生著非增上行故。	以般若無相行滿，於此生著非增上行故。	Because prajñā is the fulfillment of formless practice, attachment to this life is not a superior practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a05_18']	次「欲入」下明其標後。	次「欲入」下明其標後。	Next, below wanting to enter, it clarifies the indication of what follows.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a07_9']	十種方便即是能治，謂前樂無作不名方便，不能起增上行非殊勝道。	十種方便即是能治，謂前樂無作不名方便，不能起增上行非殊勝道。	The ten kinds of skillful means are precisely the remedies, referring to the previous enjoyment of non-action not being called skillful means, because it cannot give rise to superior practices and is not a distinguished path.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a09_17']	今以十種不捨眾生法無我智以為能治，治前樂心，名方便慧，便能攝取增上行故，名起殊勝道。	今以十種不捨眾生法無我智以為能治，治前樂心，名方便慧，便能攝取增上行故，名起殊勝道。	Now, using the ten kinds of not abandoning sentient beings and the wisdom of the non-self of dharmas as the remedies, treating the previous enjoyment of mind, is called the skillful means of prajñā, and is able to embrace superior practices, called the distinguished path of arising.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a10_16']	是則即有修空故不住空，是空中方便慧；	是則即有修空故不住空，是空中方便慧；	This then has the cultivation of emptiness, therefore not abiding in emptiness, which is the skillful means of prajñā within emptiness;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a11_14']	即空涉有故不住有，是有中殊勝道。	即空涉有故不住有，是有中殊勝道。	directly engaging with existence within emptiness, therefore not abiding in existence, which is the distinguished path of existence.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a12_10']	道即行也，所行殊勝故名增上。	道即行也，所行殊勝故名增上。	The path is precisely practice, because the practice is distinguished, it is called superior.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a12_15', 'ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a13_12']	於何增上？🔽謂前所寄世出世中即空，故勝於世間；	於何增上？ 謂前所寄世出世中即空，故勝於世間；	Superior to what?🔽It refers to the previously entrusted mundane and supramundane, which is empty, therefore superior to the world;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a14_4']	即能涉有，故勝出世間。	即能涉有，故勝出世間。	directly able to engage with existence, therefore superior to the supramundane.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a16_2']	前六地中雖亦修悲不住於無，而在寂不能、出空方作，故不得方便殊勝之名；	前六地中雖亦修悲不住於無，而在寂不能、出空方作，故不得方便殊勝之名；	Although in the first six grounds one also cultivates compassion and does not dwell in emptiness, one is unable to act in quiescence and must emerge from emptiness in order to act, so one does not obtain the name of superior skillful means.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a17_1']	雖行空行有而多著空，但名樂無作治。	雖行空行有而多著空，但名樂無作治。	Although one practices the conduct of emptiness, one still mostly clings to emptiness and is only called one who delights in the remedy of non-action.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a18_4']	二徵顯中，所以勝行得增上無勝者，由下十義故。	二徵顯中，所以勝行得增上無勝者，由下十義故。	In the second, the reason why the superior practices obtain supremacy is due to the following ten meanings.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a18_20']	義各二句，皆上句觀空、下句涉有。	義各二句，皆上句觀空、下句涉有。	Each meaning has two sentences, both with the contemplation of emptiness in the upper sentence and the engagement with existence in the lower sentence.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a19_13']	上句得下句，即成空中方便慧；	上句得下句，即成空中方便慧；	The upper sentence obtains the lower sentence, which then forms the wisdom of skillful means within emptiness;
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a20_9']	下句得上句，即成有中殊勝行。	下句得上句，即成有中殊勝行。	The lower sentence obtains the upper sentence, which then forms the superior practices within existence.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a20_19']	不滯空有，並致雖言。	不滯空有，並致雖言。	Not stagnating in either emptiness or existence, both are referred to with the word although.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a22_2']	論主攝十為四種功德，謂前三各一、後七為一故。	論主攝十為四種功德，謂前三各一、後七為一故。	The treatise author summarizes the ten into four kinds of merits, namely the first three each being one and the last seven being one.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a22_12']	一初句即護惡行因事。	一初句即護惡行因事。	The first sentence is the matter of guarding against the causes of evil conduct.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a23_3']	菩薩惡行有其二種：	菩薩惡行有其二種：	There are two kinds of evil conduct for bodhisattvas:
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a23_14']	一不樂利樂、二起愛見。	一不樂利樂、二起愛見。	One is not delighting in benefiting and bringing happiness, and the other is giving rise to attachment and views.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a24_12']	今由上句故無愛見，由下句故能利樂。	今由上句故無愛見，由下句故能利樂。	Now, due to the upper phrase, there is no attachment or view, and due to the lower phrase, one is able to benefit and bring joy.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a26_3']	若二中互闕皆有惡行，今由二句護之，為無愛見之悲因事。	若二中互闕皆有惡行，今由二句護之，為無愛見之悲因事。	If either of the two is lacking, there will be evil conduct. Now, the two phrases protect against it, being the cause and condition for the compassion that is free from attachment and views.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a26_12']	二即財及身勝因事。	二即財及身勝因事。	The second is the cause and condition for the superior wealth and body.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a27_3']	由供佛故，獲財及身。	由供佛故，獲財及身。	Due to making offerings to the Buddha, one attains wealth and a body.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a28_12']	由得平等故，二事皆勝，勝財則隨物所須、勝身隨意取其何類。	由得平等故，二事皆勝，勝財則隨物所須、勝身隨意取其何類。	Due to attaining equality, both matters are superior. Superior wealth means providing what beings need, and the superior body means taking on whatever form one wishes.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815a29_1']	三護善根因事。	三護善根因事。	The third is the cause and condition for protecting wholesome roots.
['ZH_T35_1735_041:0815b02_14']	善根即勤集福德為菩提資糧，今以即空智而集，是得彼勝因增上，令所集功德法皆成增上波羅蜜行，名之為護。	善根即勤集福德為菩提資糧，今以即空智而集，是得彼勝因增上，令所集功德法皆成增上波羅蜜行，名之為護。	Wholesome roots refer to diligently accumulating merit and virtue as provisions for enlightenment. Now, using the wisdom of emptiness to accumulate, this is the supreme cause and condition for attaining them, causing all accumulated meritorious virtues and dharmas to become the supreme pāramitā practices, which is called protection.
