Using the oneness to show many demonstrates the characteristic of conventional existence. Using the many to show one demonstrates the characteristic of emptiness. Using neither one nor many to demonstrate shows the characteristic of the middle.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036a15_6']	於一念心而論三相，不前不後亦不一時。	於一念心而論三相，不前不後亦不一時。	005	Within one thought, discussing the three characteristics, neither before nor after, and also not at the same time.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036a18_2']	若在空前，即生死假。	若在空前，即生死假。	005	If it is before emptiness, then it is the conventional existence of birth and death.

Therefore, in the three contemplations, the provisional is shown first.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036a22_7']	日夜常生無量眾生者，謂一業成，百千萬生受報不盡，一一果報皆有假名。	日夜常生無量眾生者，謂一業成，百千萬生受報不盡，一一果報皆有假名。	005	Constantly giving rise to immeasurable beings day and night means that for every completed karma, one receives retribution in hundreds of thousands of lives without end. Each retribution has a provisional name.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036a24_9', 'ZH_T39_1784_005:0036a25_3']	十二因緣，喻如鉤鎖相續無際，故云一心一切心。🔽此生死假，即建立中所治之病。	十二因緣，喻如鉤鎖相續無際，故云一心一切心。 此生死假，即建立中所治之病。	005	The twelve links of dependent origination are like a chain, continuing without end. Therefore, it is said that one mind is all minds.🔽This provisional of birth and death is the illness to be treated in the establishment.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036a28_7']	須約四性，檢一念心生滅叵得，一心既空一切安有？	須約四性，檢一念心生滅叵得，一心既空一切安有？	005	One must examine a single thought according to the four natures, and the arising and ceasing cannot be obtained. Since the one mind is empty, how can anything else exist?
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b01_9']	故舉小火小珠喻一心空，燒薪澄海喻一切空，故云能觀心空，從心所生一切諸心無不即空。	故舉小火小珠喻一心空，燒薪澄海喻一切空，故云能觀心空，從心所生一切諸心無不即空。	005	Therefore, a small fire and a small pearl are used as analogies for the emptiness of the one mind. Burning firewood and a clear ocean are used as analogies for the emptiness of everything. Therefore, it is said that if one contemplates the emptiness of the mind, all the various minds that arise from the mind are none other than emptiness.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b02_8']	欲明空觀其相顯故，故寄二乘分齊而說。	欲明空觀其相顯故，故寄二乘分齊而說。	005	In order to clarify the characteristics of the contemplation of emptiness, it is explained in terms of the limits of the two vehicles.

Ordinary people and those of the two vehicles rely on it, attached to the two kinds of pleasure of existence and emptiness.

Therefore, it belongs to the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b10_4']	佛及菩薩達二邊中，故名求理；	佛及菩薩達二邊中，故名求理；	005	The buddhas and bodhisattvas penetrate both extremes and the middle, therefore it is called seeking the principle.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b19_11']	《大經》依智，智體如是，初心依止即名佛行。	《大經》依智，智體如是，初心依止即名佛行。	005	The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra relies on wisdom, and the essence of wisdom is like this. The initial mind that relies on it is called the practice of the Buddha.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b23_5']	但今假觀列於空後，復明藥病是建立假。	但今假觀列於空後，復明藥病是建立假。	005	But now the contemplating of the provisional is listed after emptiness, and it again clarifies the medicine and illness, which is the establishing of the provisional.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b24_13']	又前般若體是三智，但於一念略明修相，不須借義示於觀法。	又前般若體是三智，但於一念略明修相，不須借義示於觀法。	005	Moreover, the previous prajñā is the essence of the three knowledges, but only briefly clarifies the characteristics of cultivation in a single thought, and does not need to borrow the meaning to demonstrate the method of contemplation.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b25_4']	今菩提翻道，是能通義。	今菩提翻道，是能通義。	005	Now, bodhi is translated as path, which means being able to penetrate through.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b29_8']	」四皆度生，令三觀中皆云度心數之眾生，乃是借彼度他生義，成今三觀度已眾生，故知附法含託事義。	」四皆度生，令三觀中皆云度心數之眾生，乃是借彼度他生義，成今三觀度已眾生，故知附法含託事義。	005	All four are about liberating sentient beings, and in the three contemplations it all says to liberate the multitude of sentient beings in the mental activities. This is borrowing the meaning of liberating other sentient beings to accomplish the three contemplations of liberating one's own sentient beings in the present. Therefore, one should know that it is attached to the Dharma and includes the meaning of relying on events.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036b29_13']	文自為三：	文自為三：	005	The text itself has three parts:

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036c04_13']	起非次第，故交橫繚亂，乃舉四物喻繚亂相，如絲之亂、如沙之多、如蠶自縛、如蛾自然，此四喻於世間因果，是故總云為苦為惱。	起非次第，故交橫繚亂，乃舉四物喻繚亂相，如絲之亂、如沙之多、如蠶自縛、如蛾自然，此四喻於世間因果，是故總云為苦為惱。	005	Arising in a non-sequential manner, they are intertwined and chaotic. Four objects are used as metaphors for the chaotic appearances, like the confusion of silk, the abundance of sand, the self-binding of silkworms, and the natural self-immolation of moths. These four metaphors are about the causes and effects in the world. Therefore, it is said in general that they are suffering and afflictions.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036c05_8']	次若知下，正明即空菩提心觀。	次若知下，正明即空菩提心觀。	005	Next, if one understands... is the correct explanation of the contemplation of the mind of enlightenment that is emptiness.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0036c13_1']	此空心數望彼見思，而得名智。	此空心數望彼見思，而得名智。	005	This mind that is empty, when compared to the views and attachments, can be called wisdom.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040a27_3']	是前文已用教觀釋其讖譯三字題訖，今復用教觀解真諦譯帝王二字，何曾但附讖譯三字之法，而約真諦二字明觀？	是前文已用教觀釋其讖譯三字題訖，今復用教觀解真諦譯帝王二字，何曾但附讖譯三字之法，而約真諦二字明觀？	005	This is because the previous text has already used the teachings and contemplation to explain the three characters of the title translated by the prophecy, and now it is using the teachings and contemplation to explain the two characters of the emperor translated by Paramārtha. How could it have only attached the method of the three characters translated by the prophecy, and explained the contemplation based on the two characters of Paramārtha?
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040a27_13']	若觀此破尚讀文不委。	若觀此破尚讀文不委。	005	If one contemplates this refutation, one still does not thoroughly understand the text.

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b01_4']	以真諦所譯文雖標二、義合具三，如世帝王豈不具慧？	以真諦所譯文雖標二、義合具三，如世帝王豈不具慧？	005	Although the text translated by Paramārtha indicates two, the meaning combines to have three, how could the emperors of the world not possess wisdom?
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b01_16']	故云今明帝王應具三義也。	故云今明帝王應具三義也。	005	Therefore, it says that now it is explained that the emperor should possess three meanings.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b03_6']	立此三義為能詮名，以召所詮十種三法，以三召三令理可識。	立此三義為能詮名，以召所詮十種三法，以三召三令理可識。	005	These three meanings are established as the able to expound name, in order to summon the ten kinds of three dharmas that are to be expounded, using the three to summon the three so that the principle can be recognized.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b05_8']	至唐義淨重譯此經，名最勝王，果符大師所立三義，極尊釋帝與最義同，慧之聖神與勝義合。	至唐義淨重譯此經，名最勝王，果符大師所立三義，極尊釋帝與最義同，慧之聖神與勝義合。	005	When Yijing of the Tang dynasty retranslated this sūtra, it was named the Supreme King, and the result corresponds to the three meanings established by the great master. The supreme emperor is the same as the meaning of supreme, and wisdom and sagacity correspond with the meaning of victorious.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b05_18']	以新譯驗，三義宛然。	以新譯驗，三義宛然。	005	Examining with the new translation, the three meanings are clearly present.

In order to make the meaning clear, it adds the phrase each person does not believe under each person's anger and dispute, and under the loss of property it further adds the phrase losing propriety.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b09_16']	何不破擅加二句，使令文句成訛說耶？	何不破擅加二句，使令文句成訛說耶？	005	Why not refute the addition of two phrases, causing the text to become a distorted explanation?

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b12_6']	以十三法唯有三寶，佛在於初，八種皆同三德次第。	以十三法唯有三寶，佛在於初，八種皆同三德次第。	005	The thirteen dharmas only have the Three Jewels, with the Buddha at the beginning, and the eight kinds all the same as the sequence of the three virtues.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b13_20']	今欲準此，帝詮法身、慧詮般若、王詮解脫，順所詮故，故安慧字居二之間。	今欲準此，帝詮法身、慧詮般若、王詮解脫，順所詮故，故安慧字居二之間。	005	Now wanting to follow this, the emperor explains the Dharma body, wisdom explains prajñā, and the king explains liberation, following what is explained, therefore placing the wisdom character between the two.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b15_7']	大師宣揚多從義便，釋妙法則先法次妙，釋觀世則先世後觀。	大師宣揚多從義便，釋妙法則先法次妙，釋觀世則先世後觀。	005	The great master's proclamation and praise often follows the convenience of meaning. Explaining the wonderful Dharma first explains the Dharma and then the wonderful, explaining the observation of the world first explains the world and then the observation.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b17_1']	以今重明帝等三義，乃是法性當體之名，尚非譬喻，安得全同皇帝尊號？	以今重明帝等三義，乃是法性當體之名，尚非譬喻，安得全同皇帝尊號？	005	Now, the three meanings of emperor and so forth are the names of the essence of the Dharma, which are not even metaphors, so how can they be completely the same as the imperial title?
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b18_14']	況復自云帝王合具慧義，非謂令將經題添於慧字，那忽掩其義而責其字？	況復自云帝王合具慧義，非謂令將經題添於慧字，那忽掩其義而責其字？	005	Moreover, it is said that the emperor possesses the meaning of wisdom, not that the title of the sutra should be supplemented with the word wisdom. How can you obscure its meaning and blame its characters?

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b23_10']	釋其四者，若謂解釋帝等三義，非經史子集，即後人擅加者，且如懺摩梵語、悔過華言，今經文句不分華梵，直以首釋於懺、伏釋於悔，及黑白等五義釋之，又以鑑義訓於梵音，此等出何經論典籍？	釋其四者，若謂解釋帝等三義，非經史子集，即後人擅加者，且如懺摩梵語、悔過華言，今經文句不分華梵，直以首釋於懺、伏釋於悔，及黑白等五義釋之，又以鑑義訓於梵音，此等出何經論典籍？	005	As for explaining the four, if it is said that the explanation of the three meanings of emperor and so forth is not found in the classics, histories, and literary collections, and is therefore added by later people, then as for confession being a Sanskrit term and repentance being a Chinese term, the text of the sutra does not distinguish between Sanskrit and Chinese, but directly explains confession with 首 and repentance with 伏, and explains it with the five meanings such as black and white, and also explains the Sanskrit sound with the meaning of 鑑. From which sutras, treatises, and classics do these come from?
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b24_4']	何不責其文無所出令皆成謬？	何不責其文無所出令皆成謬？	005	Why not blame the text for having no source and thus be all wrong?

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040b27_4']	又既云智者聖師也，所說名教固非凡情俗學所能逮及，安得齊我之聞見斥聖之辯才？	又既云智者聖師也，所說名教固非凡情俗學所能逮及，安得齊我之聞見斥聖之辯才？	005	Moreover, since it is said that the wise ones are sages, the names and teachings they expound are certainly not something that ordinary people and worldly scholars can comprehend. How can you compare my knowledge and vision to the sagely eloquence?

Why is it necessary to again use the ten kinds of three dharmas to explain the emperor's wisdom and power?
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040c04_1']	且尊重名金、照了名光、應益名明，與今貴義、慧義及朝會義道理無殊，何須用此重對十法，豈非繁芿？	且尊重名金、照了名光、應益名明，與今貴義、慧義及朝會義道理無殊，何須用此重對十法，豈非繁芿？	005	Moreover, respect is called gold, illumination is called light, and response and benefit are called brightness. The principle is no different from the meaning of nobility, wisdom, and morning assembly in the present. Why is it necessary to repeatedly match these with the ten dharmas? Isn't this redundant?

['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040c12_11']	觀心十法雖從當體，而非約教，是故今釋顯從教示，一一三法即貴義、慧義及朝會義，皆是當體，名帝慧王。	觀心十法雖從當體，而非約教，是故今釋顯從教示，一一三法即貴義、慧義及朝會義，皆是當體，名帝慧王。	005	Although the ten dharmas of contemplating the mind follow the essential nature, they are not based on the teachings. Therefore, the current explanation shows that they follow the teachings, and each of the three dharmas is the meaning of preciousness, the meaning of wisdom, and the meaning of the morning assembly. They are all the essential nature, called the emperor's wisdom king.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040c13_20']	雖帝慧王與金光明三義稍同，而前從譬喻、今從當體，義勢天殊。	雖帝慧王與金光明三義稍同，而前從譬喻、今從當體，義勢天殊。	005	Although the emperor's wisdom king and the three meanings of gold, light, and brightness are slightly similar, the previous one follows the parable and the current one follows the essential nature, and the meaning is completely different.
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040c15_9']	縱使前後皆從當體，而前文自釋金等三義，今釋帝等，何曾重述？	縱使前後皆從當體，而前文自釋金等三義，今釋帝等，何曾重述？	005	Even if all the previous and later [explanations] follow the essence, the previous text itself explains the three meanings of gold, etc., and now explains the three meanings of emperor, etc., how could it ever repeat what was said before?
['ZH_T39_1784_005:0040c17_11']	又諸三法若也各具帝慧王義，則令人深信一一三法皆是經王，以即在題，非遠取義故也。	又諸三法若也各具帝慧王義，則令人深信一一三法皆是經王，以即在題，非遠取義故也。	005	Moreover, if each of the three dharmas possesses the meanings of emperor, wisdom, and king, then it will cause people to deeply believe that each of the three dharmas is the king of the sūtras, because it is right in the title, not taking the meaning from afar.
