Therefore, based on the grasper, there is the grasped, and because of the grasped, there is the grasper. This is not the ultimate truth.

['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b07_2']	若離自體有力能者，即有所得相違，譬如離於泥團可有瓶邪？	若離自體有力能者，即有所得相違，譬如離於泥團可有瓶邪？	If apart from their own substance they have the ability, then there is contradiction in what is obtained, just as if apart from the lump of clay there can be a pot.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b08_6']	物體分位法中所起，此說即是瓶生泥團，譬如瓶水。	物體分位法中所起，此說即是瓶生泥團，譬如瓶水。	The arising in the dharmas of the state of substance is called the production of the pot from the lump of clay, like the water in the pot.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b09_18']	無彼別異分位性故，亦非瓶如木故，又非泥團分位即說有瓶，猶如別瓶。	無彼別異分位性故，亦非瓶如木故，又非泥團分位即說有瓶，猶如別瓶。	Because there is no separate state nature, and also because the pot is not like wood, and also because the state of the lump of clay is not said to have a pot, just like a separate pot.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b10_12']	若自力能而有所得，此即相違。	若自力能而有所得，此即相違。	If by its own power there is something obtained, this is contradictory.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b12_4']	若樂等法因有力能即有樂等果法，樂等有故即樂等差別有所發起。	若樂等法因有力能即有樂等果法，樂等有故即樂等差別有所發起。	If the dharmas of pleasure, etc. have powerful ability as causes, then there are the dharmas of pleasure, etc. as effects. Because pleasure, etc. exist, then the distinctions of pleasure, etc. are produced.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b13_3']	此中所說有所得者，此說亦無少法相違。	此中所說有所得者，此說亦無少法相違。	Here, what is said to be obtained, this is also said to be without contradicting any dharmas.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b14_10']	若離因果而有力能說所成者，如是決定彼無力能成其因果。	若離因果而有力能說所成者，如是決定彼無力能成其因果。	If apart from cause and effect there is powerful ability to say what is accomplished, then in this way it is certain that they lack the ability to accomplish cause and effect.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b15_18']	此即或成顛倒計執、或成決定，不共因中相違離因無體故。	此即或成顛倒計執、或成決定，不共因中相違離因無體故。	This either accomplishes an inverted conceptual attachment, or it accomplishes a definite non-common cause, because in the midst of contradiction apart from cause there is no substance.
['ZH_T30_1567_007:0153b16_9']	若不共因，非一向成故。	若不共因，非一向成故。	If the non-common cause is not accomplished in one direction,
