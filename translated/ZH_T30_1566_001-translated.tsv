['ZH_T30_1566_001:0050c08_4']	借燈為名者，無分別智有寂照之功也。	借燈為名者，無分別智有寂照之功也。	The reason for borrowing the name light is that non-discriminating wisdom has the function of tranquil illumination.
['ZH_T30_1566_001:0050c09_2']	舉中標目者，鑑亡緣觀，等離二邊也。	舉中標目者，鑑亡緣觀，等離二邊也。	The reason for using middle as the title is to reflect the equality of dharmas, free from the two extremes of existence and non-existence.
['ZH_T30_1566_001:0050c10_11']	然則燈本無心、智也亡照，法性平等，中義在斯，故寄論以明之也。	然則燈本無心、智也亡照，法性平等，中義在斯，故寄論以明之也。	Therefore, the light originally has no mind, and wisdom is beyond illumination. The equality of dharmalakṣaṇa is the meaning of middle. Thus, it is explained through the treatise.
['ZH_T30_1566_001:0050c12_14']	若夫尋詮滯旨、執俗迷真，顛沛斷常之間、造次有無之內，守名喪實、攀葉亡根者，豈欲爾哉？	若夫尋詮滯旨、執俗迷真，顛沛斷常之間、造次有無之內，守名喪實、攀葉亡根者，豈欲爾哉？	If one is attached to the meaning while following the teachings, clings to the conventional while being deluded about the true, falls into the extremes of annihilation and permanence, or creates existence and non-existence in vain, loses the substance while clinging to the name, and abandons the root while grasping at the leaves, is this really what one wishes to do?
['ZH_T30_1566_001:0050c12_19']	蓋有由矣！	蓋有由矣！	There must be a reason for this.

['ZH_T30_1566_001:0050c19_13']	若乃搆分別之因、招虛妄之果，惑業熏其內識、惡友結其外緣，致令慢聳崇山、見深滄海、恚火難觸、詞鋒罕當，聞說有而快心、聽談空而起謗，六種偏執各謂非偏、五百論師爭興異論，或將邪亂正，或以偽齊真，識似悟而翻迷、教雖通而更壅，可謂捐珠翫石、棄寶負薪，觀畫怖龍、尋跡怯象。	若乃搆分別之因、招虛妄之果，惑業熏其內識、惡友結其外緣，致令慢聳崇山、見深滄海、恚火難觸、詞鋒罕當，聞說有而快心、聽談空而起謗，六種偏執各謂非偏、五百論師爭興異論，或將邪亂正，或以偽齊真，識似悟而翻迷、教雖通而更壅，可謂捐珠翫石、棄寶負薪，觀畫怖龍、尋跡怯象。	If one constructs the causes of discrimination and invites the fruits of falsehood, afflictions and karma will permeate one's inner consciousness, and evil friends will form external conditions, causing arrogance to tower like a mountain, views to be as deep as the ocean, anger to be hard to approach, and words to be rarely applicable. Hearing talk of existence, one delights in it; listening to discussions of emptiness, one gives rise to slander. Each of the six biased attachments considers itself unbiased, and five hundred debaters argue over different theories, either confusing wrong with right or equating false with true. One's understanding seems to awaken but turns to delusion, and although the teachings are transmitted, they become even more obstructed. This can be said to be like discarding a pearl to play with a stone, abandoning a treasure to carry firewood, being frightened by a painting of a dragon, or being timid in seeking the tracks of an elephant.

He received the prophecy of the Sole Honored One and ignited the torch of the Dharma in Jambudvīpa. Moreover, his ground surpassed the initial stage of reliance, and his merit surpassed the stage of subjugation. He exhausted the one reality and investigated the two abilities. Wearing the two seals, he determined the hundred schools, and mixed the three emptinesses with the myriad things. He marked the number of dust-like eons and tested through various difficulties. Grieving over the deluded masses, he composed this treatise, with profound text and subtle meaning, skillful refutation and promotion. Those of dull faculties, upon encountering it, often give rise to fear and retreat.
['ZH_T30_1566_001:0050c28_6']	有分別明菩薩者，大乘法將，體道居衷，遐覽真言，為其釋論，開祕密藏、賜如意珠，略廣相成、師資互顯。	有分別明菩薩者，大乘法將，體道居衷，遐覽真言，為其釋論，開祕密藏、賜如意珠，略廣相成、師資互顯。	There was a bodhisattva named Vibhajyālokara, a great vehicle general, who embodied the Way and resided in the middle. He extensively perused the true words and wrote a treatise to explain them, opening the secret treasury and bestowing the wish-fulfilling jewel. The brief and extensive complement each other, and the teacher and disciple mutually illuminate.
['ZH_T30_1566_001:0051a01_15']	至若自乘異執欝起千端、外道殊計紛然萬緒，驢乘競馳於駕駟、螢火爭耀於龍燭，莫不標其品類、顯厥師宗。	至若自乘異執欝起千端、外道殊計紛然萬緒，驢乘競馳於駕駟、螢火爭耀於龍燭，莫不標其品類、顯厥師宗。	As for the different doctrines of their own vehicles, they give rise to a thousand branches, and the various theories of non-Buddhists are confused with myriad strands. Donkeys compete with horses in speed, and fireflies vie with dragons for radiance. They all mark their categories and reveal their teachers' tenets.
['ZH_T30_1566_001:0051a02_4']	玉石既分，玄黃已判。	玉石既分，玄黃已判。	Once jade and stone are distinguished, the profound and the variegated are already divided.

He unifies the six directions and penetrates the three powers, embraces the four forms of life and promotes the ten wholesome deeds. He reveres the foundation, rests the branches, and rules the world without doing anything. He guards the mother and preserves the son, governing without speaking. He is also focused on the Buddhist canon and thinks of the ultimate truth from afar. He thinks that the sacred teachings have flowed eastward for several hundred years, but many of the billions of meanings are still lacking. He eagerly listens to what he has not heard before, laboring in his sleep.

He lost his self and delighted in the mind, searched for the profound to nourish his nature. Traveling to various places was on his mind, and benefiting beings was his intention. Therefore, he was able to attach himself to a stake to transmit his body, and raise smoke to summon companions. He braved the ice and frost to cross the Pamir Mountains, and endured the wind and heat to cross the sandy river.
