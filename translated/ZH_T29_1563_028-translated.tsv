['ZH_T29_1563_028:0908c23_10']	隨煩惱中嫉等六種，一切皆與憂根相應，以慼行轉唯意地故。	隨煩惱中嫉等六種，一切皆與憂根相應，以慼行轉唯意地故。	Among the secondary afflictions, the six kinds such as jealousy are all associated with the faculty of sorrow, because they operate with a downcast demeanor and are only in the mental realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0908c23_15', 'ZH_T29_1563_028:0908c24_10', 'ZH_T29_1563_028:0908c25_4']	有餘師說：🔽惱喜相應，見取等流應歡行故。🔽慳喜相應，以歡行轉唯意地故。	有餘師說： 惱喜相應，見取等流應歡行故。 慳喜相應，以歡行轉唯意地故。	Some other teachers say:🔽Vexation is associated with joy, because it should be the mode of delight as the outflow of the view of holding to an extreme.🔽Stinginess is associated with joy, because it operates with a delighted demeanor and is only in the mental realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0908c25_18']	歡行轉者，慳相與貪極相似故。	歡行轉者，慳相與貪極相似故。	As for operating with a delighted demeanor, the appearance of stinginess is extremely similar to greed.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0908c26_17']	諂誑眠覆憂喜相應，歡慼行轉唯意地故。	諂誑眠覆憂喜相應，歡慼行轉唯意地故。	Deceit, hypocrisy, torpor, and the two obstructions are associated with sorrow and joy, because they occur in the modes of elation and depression and evolve only in the realm of manas.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0908c28_6']	歡慼行者，謂或有時以歡喜心而行諂等，或時有以憂慼心行。	歡慼行者，謂或有時以歡喜心而行諂等，或時有以憂慼心行。	Sometimes they occur in the mode of elation with a joyful mind, and sometimes they occur in the mode of depression with a sorrowful mind.

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a01_5']	既說誑是貪等流故，但應歡行，不應說與憂根相應，是歡等流不應慼故。	既說誑是貪等流故，但應歡行，不應說與憂根相應，是歡等流不應慼故。	since it is said that hypocrisy is a result of craving, it should only occur in the mode of elation and should not be associated with the faculty of sorrow. As a result of elation, it should not be depressed.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a02_5']	又正誑時不應慼故，或應說誑是癡等流。	又正誑時不應慼故，或應說誑是癡等流。	Also, when one is actually being hypocritical, he should not be depressed. Or it should be said that hypocrisy is a result of delusion.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a03_17']	憍喜樂相應，歡行唯意故，在第三靜慮與樂相應，若在下諸地與喜相應。	憍喜樂相應，歡行唯意故，在第三靜慮與樂相應，若在下諸地與喜相應。	Arrogance is associated with joy and satisfaction, because it occurs in the mode of elation and evolves only in the realm of manas. It is associated with satisfaction in the third trance state, and if it is in stages below that, it is associated with joy.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a05_15']	此上所說諸隨煩惱，一切皆與捨受相應，相續斷時皆住捨故，有通行在唯捨地故。	此上所說諸隨煩惱，一切皆與捨受相應，相續斷時皆住捨故，有通行在唯捨地故。	All the secondary passions mentioned above are associated with the faculty of indifference, because when their continuity is cut off, they all rest in indifference, and because there is a universal activity that occurs only in the stage of indifference.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a06_14']	捨於一切相應無遮，譬如無明遍相應故。	捨於一切相應無遮，譬如無明遍相應故。	Indifference is not prohibited in any association, because it is like nescience, which is associated with all.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a08_16']	餘無慚愧、惛沈、掉舉，四皆遍與五受相應，前二是大不善地法攝故，後二是大煩惱地法攝故。	餘無慚愧、惛沈、掉舉，四皆遍與五受相應，前二是大不善地法攝故，後二是大煩惱地法攝故。	The remaining four, shamelessness, torpor, and restlessness, are all associated with the five feelings, because the first two are included in the category of great demerit, and the last two are included in the category of great affliction.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a09_6', 'ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a11_14']	說二及聲顯難及釋。🔽謂於惱誑設難如前，理應釋言果因相別，如無慚掉雖貪等流，而與憂苦有相應義，故知所說與受相應。	說二及聲顯難及釋。 謂於惱誑設難如前，理應釋言果因相別，如無慚掉雖貪等流，而與憂苦有相應義，故知所說與受相應。	The words “two” and “etc.” indicate difficulty and explanation.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a13_3']	不唯同因但據相別許有憂慼而行誑者，情有所憂而行誑故。	不唯同因但據相別許有憂慼而行誑者，情有所憂而行誑故。	That is, if someone objects to the above explanation of affliction and deception, it should be explained that the characteristics of effect and cause are different. For example, although shamelessness and restlessness are the outflow of craving, etc., they can still be associated with sorrow and suffering. Therefore, we know that what is said about being associated with feelings is not only the same cause, but also according to the difference in characteristics. It is allowed that there is sorrow and dejection, because those who engage in deception have something to worry about.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a14_7']	所說煩惱隨煩惱中，有依異門佛說為蓋，今次應辯。	所說煩惱隨煩惱中，有依異門佛說為蓋，今次應辯。	Among the afflictions and secondary afflictions that have been explained, the Buddha has spoken of them as hindrances from another perspective. We should now explain them.

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a18_2']	如契經言，若說五蓋為不善聚，是為正說。	如契經言，若說五蓋為不善聚，是為正說。	A scripture says, If it is said that the five hindrances are a mass of evil, this is correct.

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a19_2']	如是五種純是圓滿不善聚故。	如是五種純是圓滿不善聚故。	Because these five are a pure and complete mass of evil.

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a20_10']	一欲貪蓋、二瞋恚蓋、三惛眠蓋、四掉悔蓋、五疑蓋。	一欲貪蓋、二瞋恚蓋、三惛眠蓋、四掉悔蓋、五疑蓋。	The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of malice, the hindrance of torpor and sleep, the hindrance of restlessness and regret, and the hindrance of doubt.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a21_10']	契經既說蓋唯不善，故知唯在欲，非色無色界。	契經既說蓋唯不善，故知唯在欲，非色無色界。	Since a scripture says that the hindrances are only unwholesome, we know that they exist only in the realm of desire and not in the realm of form or the formless realm.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a22_18', 'ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a24_16']	由此為證，知惛掉疑體雖皆通欲色無色，而但欲界有得蓋名。🔽為顯惛沈、掉舉二種唯欲界者有立為蓋，故與眠悔和合而立，眠悔唯是欲界繫故。	由此為證，知惛掉疑體雖皆通欲色無色，而但欲界有得蓋名。 為顯惛沈、掉舉二種唯欲界者有立為蓋，故與眠悔和合而立，眠悔唯是欲界繫故。	On the basis of this evidence, we know that torpor, restlessness, and doubt, although all universal in the three realms, are called hindrances only in the realm of desire.🔽In order to show that torpor and restlessness exist as hindrances only in the realm of desire, they are established as hindrances in combination with sleep and regret, because sleep and regret are only bound to the realm of desire.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a26_14']	為顯眠悔唯染污者有得蓋名，故與惛沈掉舉二種和合而立，惛掉唯是染污性故。	為顯眠悔唯染污者有得蓋名，故與惛沈掉舉二種和合而立，惛掉唯是染污性故。	In order to show that sleep and regret are called hindrances only when they are defiled, they are established as hindrances in combination with torpor and restlessness, because torpor and restlessness are only of defiled natures.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a27_4']	疑准前四，在欲可知。	疑准前四，在欲可知。	Doubt is the same as the above four, and it should be understood that it exists in the realm of desire.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909a29_2']	何緣欲貪瞋恚疑蓋各於一體別立蓋名，而彼惛眠掉悔二蓋各於二體合立蓋名？	何緣欲貪瞋恚疑蓋各於一體別立蓋名，而彼惛眠掉悔二蓋各於二體合立蓋名？	Why are the hindrances of desire, anger, and doubt each established as a separate hindrance based on a single substance, while the two hindrances of torpor and sleep, and agitation and regret, are each established as a single hindrance combining two substances?
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b01_1']	欲貪瞋疑食治各別，是故一一別立蓋名。	欲貪瞋疑食治各別，是故一一別立蓋名。	The food, objects, and antidotes of desire, anger, and doubt are each different, therefore each is established as a separate hindrance.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b02_8']	由惛與眠及掉與悔，所食能治事用皆同，故體雖殊俱合立一。	由惛與眠及掉與悔，所食能治事用皆同，故體雖殊俱合立一。	Because the food, objects, and antidotes of torpor and sleep, and agitation and regret, are all the same, therefore although their substances are different, they are combined and established as a single hindrance.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b03_7']	欲貪蓋食謂可愛相，此蓋對治謂不淨想。	欲貪蓋食謂可愛相，此蓋對治謂不淨想。	The food of the hindrance of desire is the characteristic of what is lovely. The antidote to this hindrance is the thought of impurity.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b04_6']	瞋恚蓋食謂可憎相，此蓋對治謂慈善根。	瞋恚蓋食謂可憎相，此蓋對治謂慈善根。	The food of the hindrance of anger is the characteristic of what is detestable. The antidote to this hindrance is the root of goodness of loving-kindness.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b04_18']	疑蓋食謂三世，如契經說：	疑蓋食謂三世，如契經說：	The food of the hindrance of doubt is the three periods of time, as a scripture teaches:

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b09_8']	惛眠蓋食謂五種法，一𧄼瞢、二不悅、三頻申、四食不平性、五心昧劣性，此蓋對治謂光明想，此蓋事用謂俱能令心性沈昧。	惛眠蓋食謂五種法，一𧄼瞢、二不悅、三頻申、四食不平性、五心昧劣性，此蓋對治謂光明想，此蓋事用謂俱能令心性沈昧。	The nutriments of the hindrances of torpor and sleep are five dharmas: 1) lassitude, 2) dissatisfaction, 3) yawning, 4) an unbalanced condition of food, and 5) a dull and weak state of mind. The antidote to this hindrance is the idea of light. The function of this hindrance is to cause the nature of mind to be dull and confused.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b12_15']	掉悔蓋食謂四種法，一親里尋、二國土尋、三不死尋、四隨念昔種種所更笑戲歡娛承奉等事，此蓋對治謂奢摩他，此蓋事用謂俱能令心不寂靜。	掉悔蓋食謂四種法，一親里尋、二國土尋、三不死尋、四隨念昔種種所更笑戲歡娛承奉等事，此蓋對治謂奢摩他，此蓋事用謂俱能令心不寂靜。	The nutriments of the hindrance of agitation and regret are four dharmas: 1) discursive thought about relatives, 2) discursive thought about one’s country, 3) discursive thought about immortality, and 4) recollection of past events, such as laughter, play, joy, and service. The antidote to this hindrance is śamatha. The function of this hindrance is to cause the mind to be not tranquil.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b13_14']	由此說食治用同故，惛眠掉悔二合為一。	由此說食治用同故，惛眠掉悔二合為一。	For this reason, it is said that the nutriments, antidotes, and functions are the same, and torpor and sleep and agitation and regret are combined into one.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b14_14']	或貪瞋疑是滿煩惱，一一能荷一覆蓋用。	或貪瞋疑是滿煩惱，一一能荷一覆蓋用。	Or, craving, hatred, and doubt are full afflictions, each able to bear the function of a single cover.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b15_14']	惛眠掉悔非滿煩惱，二合方荷一覆蓋用。	惛眠掉悔非滿煩惱，二合方荷一覆蓋用。	Torpor, sleep, and agitation and regret are not full afflictions, and only when combined do they bear the function of a single cover.

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b17_3']	謂決定能覆障聖道聖道加行，故立蓋名。	謂決定能覆障聖道聖道加行，故立蓋名。	Because they can definitely cover and obstruct the holy path and the practice of the holy path, they are established as hindrances.

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b22_18']	理實應爾，然佛世尊於立蓋門唯說五者，唯此於五蘊能為勝障故。	理實應爾，然佛世尊於立蓋門唯說五者，唯此於五蘊能為勝障故。	In reality, it should be so. However, the Buddha, the World-Honored One, only spoke of five in establishing the hindrances because only these five can be the supreme obstructions among the five aggregates.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b23_17', 'ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b24_18']	謂貪恚蓋能障戒蘊，如次令遠離欲惡故。🔽惛沈睡眠能障慧蘊，此二俱令遠毘鉢舍那故。	謂貪恚蓋能障戒蘊，如次令遠離欲惡故。 惛沈睡眠能障慧蘊，此二俱令遠毘鉢舍那故。	The hindrances of craving and anger can obstruct the aggregate of morality, because they respectively cause one to be far from renouncing desires and evil.🔽Dullness and sleepiness can obstruct the aggregate of wisdom, because both of them cause one to be far from vipaśyanā.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b25_17']	掉舉惡作能障定蘊，此俱令遠奢摩他故。	掉舉惡作能障定蘊，此俱令遠奢摩他故。	Agitation and remorse can obstruct the aggregate of concentration, because both of them cause one to be far from śamatha.

Because of this, later on, one gives rise to doubt regarding the four fruits of action. Because of doubt, one is able to cause even liberation and the knowledge and vision of liberation to not arise.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0909b28_14']	故唯此五建立為蓋。	故唯此五建立為蓋。	Therefore, only these five are established as hindrances.

This, based on subduing and eliminating, says that the gates of vipaśyanā and śamatha separately counter the two hindrances of torpor and distraction and remorse;

The passions of the two upper realms that have as their object the two lower realms are also eliminated by the complete knowledge of the object-field, because the two upper realms are universally eliminated by the two kinds of knowledge of suffering and its cause that are produced in the class of superior faculties.

The antidote of elimination, which is the path that directly eliminates the attainment of various delusions, namely the uninterrupted path.🔽2. The antidote of upholding, which is the path that initially arises together with the attainment of elimination, namely the path of liberation.

['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c13_10']	諸惑永斷定從所緣，以於所緣遍知力故，令惑永斷如前已說。	諸惑永斷定從所緣，以於所緣遍知力故，令惑永斷如前已說。	The permanent elimination of the passions definitely comes from the object, because the power of thorough knowledge of the object causes the passions to be eternally eliminated. This has been explained previously.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c14_8']	然惑所緣總有二種，謂有繫事及無繫事。	然惑所緣總有二種，謂有繫事及無繫事。	However, there are two kinds of objects of the passions: objects that are bound to the three realms and objects that are unbound.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c15_16']	緣有繫事為境諸惑，及從此惑力所引生不緣此事為境諸惑。	緣有繫事為境諸惑，及從此惑力所引生不緣此事為境諸惑。	Passions whose objects are bound to the three realms and passions whose objects are unbound but that are attracted and generated by the power of those passions.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c16_16']	如是二惑，於一有情現相續中引起諸得。	如是二惑，於一有情現相續中引起諸得。	In this way, the two kinds of passions that are present in the stream of consciousness of a single sentient being give rise to various acquisitions.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c18_5']	設無染污心現在前，此得恒行無有間斷，為去來世諸惑果因。	設無染污心現在前，此得恒行無有間斷，為去來世諸惑果因。	Even when a nondefiled mind is present, these acquisitions always continue and are not interrupted, and they are the cause of the passions and their effects in the future.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c20_12']	如是應知，緣無繫事為境諸惑，及因此惑勢力所引隨從現行，不緣此事為境諸惑，所引起得類亦同前。	如是應知，緣無繫事為境諸惑，及因此惑勢力所引隨從現行，不緣此事為境諸惑，所引起得類亦同前。	In this way, it should be understood that the passions that have as their objects the unassociated dharmas and the passions that are attracted and follow as a result of these passions, but which do not have these dharmas as objects, give rise to acquisitions that are the same as the above.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c22_6']	言為去來惑果因者，謂此諸得現在世時，是過去惑等流性故，說之為果；	言為去來惑果因者，謂此諸得現在世時，是過去惑等流性故，說之為果；	As for the phrase that they are the cause of the effects of the passions of the past and future, it means that when these acquisitions are present, they are the nature of the outflow of past passions and are therefore called effects.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c23_1']	是未來惑生緣性故，說之為因。	是未來惑生緣性故，說之為因。	They are the nature of the condition as cause of future passions and are therefore called causes.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c25_7']	然此諸得與斷對治等流諸得現行相違，能持去來所得諸惑，故令一切緣此事惑及緣餘惑相續而轉。	然此諸得與斷對治等流諸得現行相違，能持去來所得諸惑，故令一切緣此事惑及緣餘惑相續而轉。	However, these acquisitions are opposed to the present functioning of the acquisitions of the antidote that eliminates the passions, and they maintain the passions that are acquired in the past and future and cause the passions that have these dharmas as objects and those that have other objects as objects to continue in a series.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0910c27_14']	緣此事境諸斷對治等流起時惑得便絕，所得諸惑於自所緣雖體猶有，而由因果得永絕故可說名斷。	緣此事境諸斷對治等流起時惑得便絕，所得諸惑於自所緣雖體猶有，而由因果得永絕故可說名斷。	When the antidote of elimination is generated in regard to this object, the power of the passions is cut off. Although the passions that have been acquired still exist in regard to their objects, because the cause and effect are forever cut off, one can say that they are eliminated.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0911a01_3']	以於少境若未遍知緣此境惑，及因此惑力所引起緣餘境惑，所引去來惑果因得，現相續中無間而轉。	以於少境若未遍知緣此境惑，及因此惑力所引起緣餘境惑，所引去來惑果因得，現相續中無間而轉。	Because if one has not yet fully known a small object, the passions that have it as an object and the passions that have other objects as objects, which are attracted by the power of these passions, and the results and causes of the passions of the past and future are uninterrupted in the present series.
['ZH_T29_1563_028:0911a02_11']	若於少境得遍知時，惑所引得便不復轉，故知惑斷定從所緣。	若於少境得遍知時，惑所引得便不復轉，故知惑斷定從所緣。	When one has fully known a small object, the acquisition attracted by the passions is not again active. Therefore we know that the elimination of the passions definitely results from the object.

That is to say, the elimination of passions that are eliminated by seeing the four truths in the desire realm, and the elimination of passions that are eliminated by seeing the three truths in the form and formless realms, the attainment of the elimination of passions is complete in six situations.

There are two kinds of times: the time of the arising of the antidote and the time of the acquisition of the fruit. These two make six times.

One definitely does not generate the pure antidote to these bonds, because the path of the candidate for the fruit of the second stage of once-returning subsumes the path of the candidate for the fruit of the first stage of stream-winner. When one is abiding in the fruit of the first stage, one does not generate the path of the candidate for the fruit of the second stage, because one who abides in a superior fruit does not generate an inferior fruit.

It is not the case that what was not previously acquired can be said to be abandoned now.
