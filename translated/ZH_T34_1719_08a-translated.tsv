However, are there not bodhisattvas who first contradict and later accord? Therefore, it is known that the current predictions for the śrāvakas must exclude the general explanation.

In the beginning, the text generally raises the question. Next, below Vimalakīrti, specifically cite three sūtras. First, citing the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, since Maitreya received the prediction and will become the next Buddha, he will be born in Tuṣita Heaven and become the lord of that heaven. The celestial sons there will come in advance to pay respects. Maitreya explains for them that receiving the prediction is due to the stage of nonretrogression;

['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0295c26_10']	初文言「此見須破」等者，意云有見須破、願記須與，豈可專引《淨名》等耶？	初文言「此見須破」等者，意云有見須破、願記須與，豈可專引《淨名》等耶？	The first passage says this view must be destroyed and so on. The meaning is that the view of existence must be destroyed and the prediction must be given. How can one only quote the Vimalakirti Sutra and so on?

However, these five meanings must be discussed in terms of this sutra to distinguish it from other sutras, or slow like the śrāvakas, or fast like the dragon girl.

In this chapter, it only predicts the eight appearances, as explained before and after.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a13_8']	「瓔珞八記」者，今經已眾無不知者，故前四句中，今經唯有第三句，純顯露故，於中不必在第七地，如不輕中一句通記，故他經記深。	「瓔珞八記」者，今經已眾無不知者，故前四句中，今經唯有第三句，純顯露故，於中不必在第七地，如不輕中一句通記，故他經記深。	The eight predictions in the Garland Sutra - in the present sutra, the assembly has no ignorance, so among the first four sentences, the present sutra only has the third sentence, because it is purely revealed. Within it, it is not necessarily in the seventh ground, like in the one sentence in the chapter on the one who is not lightly regarded. Therefore, the predictions in other sutras are profound.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a15_9']	後四句中，初句雖云遠處不覺，化道同故亦非不覺，故今經有第三句義同初三二句也。	後四句中，初句雖云遠處不覺，化道同故亦非不覺，故今經有第三句義同初三二句也。	In the last four sentences, although the first sentence says not aware in the distant place, the way of transformation is the same, so it is also not unaware. Therefore, the present sutra has the meaning of the third sentence, which is the same as the first three sentences.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a16_1']	故知諸經實義未暢。	故知諸經實義未暢。	Therefore, it should be known that the true meaning of the various sutras has not yet been fully understood.

In the teachings of the Distinct and Perfect Vehicles, one is called non-attached upon first entering the grounds and abodes, or it is only in the Distinct Teaching from the perspective of the teaching path.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a19_10']	入無功用方無著故，據空觀成秖合在通。	入無功用方無著故，據空觀成秖合在通。	Only when one enters the effortless stage is one truly non-attached. Based on the completion of the contemplation of emptiness, one should only be in the comprehensive teaching.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a20_11']	言「七地」者，在於通教，以過二乘堪與記故。	言「七地」者，在於通教，以過二乘堪與記故。	As for the phrase seven grounds, it is in the comprehensive teaching, because one surpasses the two vehicles and is worthy of receiving the prediction.

The regressing from the great [vehicle] and the manifested [bodhisattvas] receive the prediction, while the superior and determined [śrāvakas] do not receive it.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a22_9']	有人救云，決定亦記。	有人救云，決定亦記。	Some people rescue [the treatise] by saying that the determined [śrāvakas] also receive the prediction.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a22_14']	此亦不然。	此亦不然。	This is also not correct.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a24_14']	他計決定即是定性永不發心，須指經文雖生滅想，彼土得聞，彼義自壞，何須別求？	他計決定即是定性永不發心，須指經文雖生滅想，彼土得聞，彼義自壞，何須別求？	Others calculate that the determined [śrāvakas] are those of fixed nature who will never give rise to the mind [of enlightenment]. It is necessary to point to the sūtra text that says although they give rise to the thought of extinction, they will be able to hear it in that land. Their meaning is self-contradictory, so why is it necessary to seek elsewhere?
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a25_14']	但以滅想者作凡夫釋，曲會經文令成己義。	但以滅想者作凡夫釋，曲會經文令成己義。	They simply explain the thought of extinction as an ordinary person, and twist the sūtra text to make it conform to their own meaning.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a26_15']	又《寶性論》秖云聲聞出界根鈍不云根敗。	又《寶性論》秖云聲聞出界根鈍不云根敗。	Moreover, the Baoxing lun only says that śrāvakas leave the realm due to their dull faculties, not that their faculties are ruined.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a27_12']	言根敗者，迦葉於方等即是其人。	言根敗者，迦葉於方等即是其人。	As for those with ruined faculties, Kāśyapa is precisely such a person in the Vaipulya [sutras].
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296a28_12']	若至法華敗根還復，若入滅者出界方生。	若至法華敗根還復，若入滅者出界方生。	If he reaches the Lotus Sutra, his ruined faculties will be restored. If he enters nirvāṇa, he will be reborn in the realm after leaving.

Although it is said to be without land, it is not without land. Without body or name, yet body and name surpass existence. Therefore, the names and titles of the country accord with the beings, but it is not enough to draw them in.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296b02_16']	若得今意但云八相誘物。	若得今意但云八相誘物。	If one attains the present meaning, it is said that the eight appearances guide beings.

If pratyekabuddhas are included in the śrāvaka category, they are the same as śrāvakas, appearing in a world without a Buddha, the same as those of fixed potential.

['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296b10_5']	世界中二者，初約機應相對，次單約物機，雖義云單終成機應，機感相稱如歡喜也。	世界中二者，初約機應相對，次單約物機，雖義云單終成機應，機感相稱如歡喜也。	In the world, the first is about the correspondence between the responsive and the responsive, and the next is about the objects alone. Although the meaning is said to be single, it ultimately forms the responsive and the responsive. The correspondence between the stimulus and the response is like joy.
['ZH_T34_1719_08a:0296b11_4']	為人中二者，初文改小入大已生己善。	為人中二者，初文改小入大已生己善。	In the second of the four siddhāntas, the first text changes the small to enter the great, which has already produced one's own good.

For example, within the counteractive, it is entirely directed towards others, and within the benefit for others, the first one also includes self and others, while the latter is only others.

Therefore, Nanyue used the meaning of the Samantabhadra Contemplation to say that the six sense faculties will at most not leave the three lifetimes.

It can be due to the carriage being opposed, causing the three realms to be separated from nirvana, and it can be due to the city being opposed, causing the three realms to be far from nirvana.

It is to be discussed together with the previous question about similarities and differences. Therefore, the present text says, The road ahead is still far, now wanting to turn back.

It should also be said that it is like an illusory person speaking to an illusory person. The vehicle is also called transformation, but in the middle way, speaking of the two nirvanas, the city is also the teaching. Therefore, it is known that it cannot be grasped by mutually relying on the analogy.

To prevent each from having their own calculations, it further extensively refutes fixed calculations in five places. In explaining the disclosure of skillful means, it says that although each has their own teachings, practices, people, principles, and knowledge or ignorance, it is just a one-sided explanation following the textual characteristics.
