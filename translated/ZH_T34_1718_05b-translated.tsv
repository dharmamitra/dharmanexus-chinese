Although this is an incomplete statement, it clarifies that the Buddha, with the power of wisdom, is able to seek the correct teachings and see the truths explained, and is not endangered by the five turbidities and eight sufferings, so it is called safe; the violent winds of the four inverted views cannot move it, so it is called hidden; aloof from worldly entanglements, it is called escape.

Not understanding that fire is a hot phenomenon is called not knowing. Since one does not know the heat of fire, one is not afraid of being burned, which is called not being alarmed. Not considering it a threat to one's life is called not being afraid. Sentient beings are completely unaware of the five aggregates and eight sufferings, do not know the four inverted views and three poisons, and since they do not recognize afflictions, how can they worry?

Being unaware of suffering in this way, not knowing the causes of suffering, not being alarmed at injuring the path, and not being afraid of losing cessation, not hearing the teachings on the four truths means lacking the wisdom of hearing, which is called unawareness. Not attaining the wisdom of contemplation is called unknowing;

The essence is afflicted by the four inverted views, but one does not know or realize it.
['ZH_T34_1718_05b:0068a15_4']	「心不厭患」者，不厭無常之苦，不患煩惱之集也。	「心不厭患」者，不厭無常之苦，不患煩惱之集也。	The mind is not disgusted means not being disgusted with the suffering of impermanence, and not being troubled by the accumulation of afflictions.

Play illustrates the turbidity of views, games illustrate the turbidity of afflictions, not being aware or knowing, not being startled or frightened illustrates the turbidity of sentient beings, the fire coming and the body being in pain illustrates the turbidity of life, the mind not being disgusted and having no intention of seeking to leave illustrates the turbidity of the eon.

Next, it combines the Tathāgata's initial teaching of the three vehicles to guide, and then only using the Great Vehicle. This combines the explanation and does not contradict the original intention, as stated above, First having this thought, I use skillful means to cause the children to come out.

The previous meaning is to cause the children to come out, not being concerned with the three. Since they have come out, not giving them is also not false.
['ZH_T34_1718_05b:0074b26_7']	今明如來出世，本欲說大，但為小智樂著三界，故以方便誘引既已，得出還與大乘，即稱本心，故言能與眾生大乘之法但不盡能受也。	今明如來出世，本欲說大，但為小智樂著三界，故以方便誘引既已，得出還與大乘，即稱本心，故言能與眾生大乘之法但不盡能受也。	Now, it is explained that the Tathāgata's appearance in the world originally intended to expound the Great Vehicle, but because those of small wisdom delight in and become attached to the three realms, he used skillful means to guide them. Once they have escaped, he gives them the Great Vehicle again, which accords with their original minds, thus it is said that he can give sentient beings the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, but not all of them are able to receive it.

The three are due to sentient beings, not the Buddha's original intention. Therefore, this explanation accomplishes not contradicting the original mind and not being empty.Here is the corrected and aligned text:
