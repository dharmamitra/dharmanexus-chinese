['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885a27_12']	為遮一性、異性非有邊故，大師但依假施設事而宣法要，欲令有情方便趣入，如理作意、遠離邪宗，永斷煩惱。	為遮一性、異性非有邊故，大師但依假施設事而宣法要，欲令有情方便趣入，如理作意、遠離邪宗，永斷煩惱。	In order to avoid the extremes of oneness and difference, the Great Master only relies on the hypothetical positing of events to proclaim the essential teachings, wishing to enable sentient beings to expediently enter into proper contemplation, to distance themselves from wrong views, and to permanently sever afflictions.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885a28_6']	如是三邊，皆有過故，我當開釋。	如是三邊，皆有過故，我當開釋。	Because these three extremes all have faults, I will now explain.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885a28_18']	此中取因假設，略有三種：	此中取因假設，略有三種：	Here, there are roughly three kinds of hypothetical positing of causes of grasping:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885a29_14']	一者總聚、二者相續、三者分位差別。	一者總聚、二者相續、三者分位差別。	First, aggregation; second, continuity; third, distinctions in states.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b02_2']	言總聚者，謂於一時有多法聚，隨順世間以一性說，如身林等。	言總聚者，謂於一時有多法聚，隨順世間以一性說，如身林等。	As for aggregation, it means that at one time there is a collection of many dharmas, which is spoken of as a single nature in accordance with the world, like a body, a forest, and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b04_3']	言相續者，謂於異時因果不絕，以一性說，如羯羅羅等位名之為人，芽等轉異名之為穀。	言相續者，謂於異時因果不絕，以一性說，如羯羅羅等位名之為人，芽等轉異名之為穀。	As for continuity, it means that at different times, cause and effect are uninterrupted, and is spoken of as a single nature, like the stages of kalala and so forth being called a person, and the transformations of sprouts and so forth being called grains.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b06_9']	言分位差別者，謂於一事有其多性，異不異時而為建立，如色生位異無常性、有見有對、業具性故等。	言分位差別者，謂於一事有其多性，異不異時而為建立，如色生位異無常性、有見有對、業具性故等。	As for the distinction of states, it means that there are many natures in one thing, which are established as different or non-different at different times, such as the difference between the arising state of form and impermanence, having visibility, having resistance, and having the nature of being an object of action, etc.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b07_7']	由此三義，密意說有補嗢揭羅及證圓寂。	由此三義，密意說有補嗢揭羅及證圓寂。	Based on these three meanings, the Buddha spoke of the existence of pudgala and the realization of nirvana with a hidden intention.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b08_16']	然此三義但是假設，不可說為一性、異性及總無性，有過失故。	然此三義但是假設，不可說為一性、異性及總無性，有過失故。	However, these three meanings are merely hypothetical and cannot be said to be of the same nature, a different nature, or completely non-existent, because there are errors.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b09_10']	此中且辨總聚、有聚無異性言。	此中且辨總聚、有聚無異性言。	Here, we will first discuss the general aggregate and the statement of non-difference in the aggregate.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b11_6']	事唯二種，為當許有此二自性，遮其性別，謂於有聚、總聚不別，名無異耶？	事唯二種，為當許有此二自性，遮其性別，謂於有聚、總聚不別，名無異耶？	Are these two natures of things only admitted to have these two natures, and their different natures are denied, that is, in the aggregate and the general aggregate there is no difference, called non-difference?
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b11_16']	為但無餘，說名無異？	為但無餘，說名無異？	Or is it simply the absence of the rest, called non-difference?
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b12_1']	此有何過？	此有何過？	What error is there in this?
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b12_4']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b13_17']	若無異性體無別，　　有聚更互成無異；	若無異性體無別，　　有聚更互成無異；	If there is no different nature, the substance is not separate, and the aggregate again mutually becomes non-difference;
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b14_17']	或於總聚別事殊，　　此復便成多種體。	或於總聚別事殊，　　此復便成多種體。	Or if they are different from the collection, they would again become multiple substances.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b15_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b17_7']	若許手等自性與身是一名無異者，此即於身無別性故，手等更互成無差別，手便成足，違世間故。	若許手等自性與身是一名無異者，此即於身無別性故，手等更互成無差別，手便成足，違世間故。	If you allow that the intrinsic nature of the hand and so forth is the same as the body, and are called non-different, then since there is no separate intrinsic nature from the body, the hand and so forth would become indistinguishable from each other, and the hand would become the foot, contradicting worldly convention.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b19_4']	或復說彼別別支分非身自性，於聚集時說為身者，此即全無總聚自體少分可得。	或復說彼別別支分非身自性，於聚集時說為身者，此即全無總聚自體少分可得。	Or if you say that each individual part is not the intrinsic nature of the body, and when they are assembled they are called the body, then there is absolutely no partially obtained total collection substance.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b19_14']	為異前義，故置或言。	為異前義，故置或言。	In order to distinguish from the previous meaning, the word or is placed.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b20_13']	若於別事非是總聚自性者，即是自性差別；	若於別事非是總聚自性者，即是自性差別；	If they are not the intrinsic nature of the total collection from individual events, then they are the distinctions of intrinsic nature;
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b21_15']	由別性故，於聚集時云何與彼無別自性得成應理？	由別性故，於聚集時云何與彼無別自性得成應理？	because of having a separate intrinsic nature, how could it be reasonable for them to become the same intrinsic nature as that when assembled?
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b22_6']	不由總聚捨自性故。	不由總聚捨自性故。	It is not because the total collection abandons its intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b23_5']	此復便成多種體性，總聚於多無異性故。	此復便成多種體性，總聚於多無異性故。	This would again become multiple intrinsic natures, because the total collection has no different intrinsic nature from the many.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b24_4']	若別若總是無異性，由非總別捨自性故；	若別若總是無異性，由非總別捨自性故；	Whether distinct or identical, there is no nature of difference, because neither the general nor the specific abandons its own nature.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b25_3']	若頓若漸皆成多性，望彼諸事無異性故。	若頓若漸皆成多性，望彼諸事無異性故。	Whether sudden or gradual, they all become many natures, because in relation to those various events there is no nature of difference.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b25_12']	如是且辨二計過失。	如是且辨二計過失。	This is how we distinguish the errors of the two theories.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b25_15']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b26_17']	若言唯遮餘有性，　　二種非有汝成過；	若言唯遮餘有性，　　二種非有汝成過；	If it is said that only the existence of other is denied, the two kinds of non-existence become your error.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b27_17']	若一有性是所遮，　　非無別故兩相似。	若一有性是所遮，　　非無別故兩相似。	If the existence of one is what is denied, it is not non-existent, so the two are similar.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885b28_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c01_5']	「若言唯遮餘有性，二種非有汝成過」者，若於有聚無別總聚名無異者，此即更互相待成無異性。	「若言唯遮餘有性，二種非有汝成過」者，若於有聚無別總聚名無異者，此即更互相待成無異性。	If it is said that only the existence of other is denied, the two kinds of non-existence become your error means that if in an existent aggregate there is no separate general aggregate, and it is said to be without difference, then this again mutually depends on each other to become the nature of non-difference.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c02_8']	若於一處有無異義，第二亦爾，云何汝得免斯過失？	若於一處有無異義，第二亦爾，云何汝得免斯過失？	If in one place there is the meaning of non-difference, the second is also like this. How can you avoid this error?
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c02_18']	如無總聚，有聚亦無。	如無總聚，有聚亦無。	Just as there is no general aggregate, so too there is no existent aggregate.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c03_12']	若異此者，無異之言便成無用。	若異此者，無異之言便成無用。	If it were otherwise, the words without difference would become useless.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c05_15']	若一有性是所遮者，縱許如是於他所執有分實事唯遮於此名無異者，此亦不然，事無別故。	若一有性是所遮者，縱許如是於他所執有分實事唯遮於此名無異者，此亦不然，事無別故。	If you are refuting the existence of a single nature, then even though you allow that the existence of the parts is as we have explained, and that you are only refuting the existence of something else, this is still not correct, because the parts are not different.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c07_9']	兩處相似由無異言，一處既爾，於餘亦然，如初無異言故，汝不應但遮一處。	兩處相似由無異言，一處既爾，於餘亦然，如初無異言故，汝不應但遮一處。	The similarity of the two cases is due to the fact that they are not different. Just as the first case is so, so is the second. Because of the first statement that they are not different, you should not refute only one of the two cases.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c09_2']	若言意許唯遮彼者，應可但言無其有分，勿言無異，彼之有性是不樂故。	若言意許唯遮彼者，應可但言無其有分，勿言無異，彼之有性是不樂故。	If you claim that you only intend to refute the existence of the parts, then you should only say that the parts do not exist, and should not say that they are not different, because you do not accept the existence of the parts.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c10_5']	若其許彼體性是有不許異者，說無異言方成應理。	若其許彼體性是有不許異者，說無異言方成應理。	If you claim that you accept the existence of the nature of the parts, but do not accept that they are different, then it would be reasonable to say that they are not different.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c12_16']	又有異義，非無別故兩相似者，如離手等更無別身，是有分故，如是手等亦待指等成其有分，手等如身亦成非有。	又有異義，非無別故兩相似者，如離手等更無別身，是有分故，如是手等亦待指等成其有分，手等如身亦成非有。	If you claim that the meaning of difference is not the same as the meaning of separate, and that the two cases are similar because there is no difference, then just as there is no body apart from the hands and so on, because the hands and so on are the parts of the body, in the same way the hands and so on also depend on the fingers and so on to be parts, and the hands and so on would be like the body and also not exist.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c14_6']	如是乃至極微待於聲等，聲等復待薩埵等，薩埵等復待喜等。	如是乃至極微待於聲等，聲等復待薩埵等，薩埵等復待喜等。	In the same way, the ultimate atom depends on sound, etc., and sound, etc. depend on sattva, etc., and sattva, etc. depend on joy, etc.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c15_13']	待異功能此即分，與有分同有分性故，汝所執便成非有。	待異功能此即分，與有分同有分性故，汝所執便成非有。	The different functions depend on the parts, because the parts and the whole have the same nature. Therefore, what you grasp is not existent.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c16_7']	如是且辨許無異性有二種過。	如是且辨許無異性有二種過。	In this way, it is first determined that if one admits that there is no difference, there are two kinds of errors.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c16_10']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c17_0']	異性亦爾以一邊，　　於支分處別別轉，	異性亦爾以一邊，　　於支分處別別轉，	The same is true for different natures. One part moves separately in different places of the parts,
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c18_17']	一邊便有無窮過，　　或非是一及全無。	一邊便有無窮過，　　或非是一及全無。	One part would then have the error of infinity, or it would not be one and would be completely nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c19_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c20_16']	「異性亦爾」者，有二過言流至於此，由彼於自支分轉時，或別別轉、或復遍轉。	「異性亦爾」者，有二過言流至於此，由彼於自支分轉時，或別別轉、或復遍轉。	The same is true for different natures. The words there are two errors apply to this. Because when it moves in its own parts, it either moves separately or moves everywhere.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c21_5']	此中且辨別別轉義。	此中且辨別別轉義。	Here, it is first determined that the meaning of separate movement is as follows.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c22_18']	若以一邊於手等處有分轉時，彼亦一邊猶如手等復更應有一邊隨起。	若以一邊於手等處有分轉時，彼亦一邊猶如手等復更應有一邊隨起。	If one part moves in the places of the hands, etc., it is also one part, just like the hands, etc. It should further give rise to another part.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c23_8']	如是展轉有無窮過。	如是展轉有無窮過。	In this way, there would be an infinite regress.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c24_4']	「或非是一」者，異無窮過，故置或言。	「或非是一」者，異無窮過，故置或言。	Or it is not one means that there is no infinite regress of difference, so the word or is used.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c25_14']	若言身分一邊更不轉者，此即應無一有分義，便成有分唯有一邊。	若言身分一邊更不轉者，此即應無一有分義，便成有分唯有一邊。	If it is said that one side of the body part does not turn again, then there would be no meaning of having parts, and it would be established that having parts only has one side.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c26_17']	若爾，應許唯有手等，何煩黨執於己支分有分轉耶？	若爾，應許唯有手等，何煩黨執於己支分有分轉耶？	In that case, it should be admitted that there are only hands and so forth. Why bother to insist that having parts turns on one's own limbs?
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c27_19']	「及全無」者，一邊無窮，及更有過，故置及言。	「及全無」者，一邊無窮，及更有過，故置及言。	And completely without means that there is an infinite regress of one side, and there is another fault, so the word and is used.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0885c29_9']	以此一邊於分轉時，此即全無有分可得，由非有分如手足等有其一邊。	以此一邊於分轉時，此即全無有分可得，由非有分如手足等有其一邊。	When this one side turns on the part, then it is completely without having parts that can be obtained, because having parts is not like hands and feet that have one side.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a01_10']	若言有分離手等時無別支分，有分體一故。	若言有分離手等時無別支分，有分體一故。	If it is said that when the whole is separated from the hands and so forth, there are no separate limbs, because the substance of having parts is one,
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a02_8']	若如是者，便成於彼別支分處各各遍轉。	若如是者，便成於彼別支分處各各遍轉。	if it is like this, then it is established that it turns completely on each of those separate limbs.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a03_3']	唯此二計，更無第三分別執故。	唯此二計，更無第三分別執故。	There are only these two calculations, and there is no third discrimination or insistence, so
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a03_6']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a04_0']	若遍彼成多種性，　　及於手等互無差，	若遍彼成多種性，　　及於手等互無差，	And there would be no difference between the hands and so forth,
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a05_17']	或此非彼故便成，　　諸事皆同一微性。	或此非彼故便成，　　諸事皆同一微性。	Or it would be non-existent there, thus all things would have the same subtle nature.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a06_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a07_16']	若言遍者，所許有分與支分量同，於一一處皆周遍故，彼即便成多種體性。	若言遍者，所許有分與支分量同，於一一處皆周遍故，彼即便成多種體性。	If it is said to be all-pervading, the accepted whole would have the same size as the parts, because it is all-pervading in each place. It would then have many kinds of natures.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a08_7']	更有異義，故置及言。	更有異義，故置及言。	There is another interpretation, therefore the word and is used.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a10_8']	由於一處遍皆有故，由不許彼別處性故，及餘支分更互無差，由彼和合同一處時事無別故。	由於一處遍皆有故，由不許彼別處性故，及餘支分更互無差，由彼和合同一處時事無別故。	Because it exists all-pervasively in one place, because it is not accepted to have a different nature in other places, and because there is no difference between the other parts, because when they are combined into one place, the things are not separate.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a11_7']	此則手處應許有足，便違世間共許道理。	此則手處應許有足，便違世間共許道理。	This would mean that the place of the hands should be accepted as the feet, thus contradicting the commonly accepted principles of the world.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a12_3']	「或此非彼」者，更有異計，故置或言。	「或此非彼」者，更有異計，故置或言。	Or it is non-existent there means there is another theory, therefore the word or is used.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a14_10']	為避前過，云有分體於足轉時，非於手等有分別轉，此則無有於餘支分同處過者，此同捺癭反出眼睛。	為避前過，云有分體於足轉時，非於手等有分別轉，此則無有於餘支分同處過者，此同捺癭反出眼睛。	In order to avoid the previous error, they say that the body has a part that moves from the feet to the hands, but there is no discrimination of movement. This then has no error of the same place in the other limbs, but this is like a goiter spitting out the eyes.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a17_2']	若如是者，一切有分成一實事，是故諸事成一極微，由彼有分於自支分展轉起時，乃至唯有一實極微住處可得。	若如是者，一切有分成一實事，是故諸事成一極微，由彼有分於自支分展轉起時，乃至唯有一實極微住處可得。	If it is like this, all the parts of the body become one real thing. Therefore, all the parts become one atom, because when the parts of the body arise in succession from their own limbs, there is only one real atom that can be found as a dwelling place.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a17_16']	此一支分，便與有分同一極微。	此一支分，便與有分同一極微。	This one limb then has the same atom as the body.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a18_10']	此有分執理成無用，及違自宗。	此有分執理成無用，及違自宗。	This attachment to the body becomes unreasonable and contradicts one's own doctrine.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a20_5']	若言離於色等別有極微，即無如前所說之過，由彼不於色等處轉故無此失。	若言離於色等別有極微，即無如前所說之過，由彼不於色等處轉故無此失。	If it is said that apart from form and so forth there is a separate atom, then there is no error as previously stated, because it does not arise in the place of form and so forth, so there is no error.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a20_19']	理亦不然，於此亦有二執過故。	理亦不然，於此亦有二執過故。	Reason also does not allow this, because there are two attachments in this case.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a21_13']	故應許此有別方分、或無方分。	故應許此有別方分、或無方分。	Therefore, one should allow that this has a separate direction or no direction.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a21_19']	若爾，何過？	若爾，何過？	If so, what is the error?
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a22_1']	頌曰：	頌曰：	The verse says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a23_7']	有方分性非極微。	有方分性非極微。	Those with spatial division are not ultimate atoms.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a24_17']	　　為遮一性異性故，或無方分多不聚，　　或復眾同於一微。	　　為遮一性異性故，或無方分多不聚，　　或復眾同於一微。	In order to refute the natures of oneness and difference, or without spatial division, many do not aggregate, or many are the same in one atom.
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a25_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1622_001:0886a26_1']	由非如是所執極微理得成就，有方分故。	由非如是所執極微理得成就，有方分故。	Because the ultimate atoms as conceived in this way are not established logically, they have spatial division.
