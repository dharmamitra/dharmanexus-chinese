['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c07_12']	汝先言滅三心名滅諦。	汝先言滅三心名滅諦。	012	You previously said that the extinction of the three minds is called the truth of cessation.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c08_14']	已知滅假名心因緣，今何謂法心，云何當滅？	已知滅假名心因緣，今何謂法心，云何當滅？	012	We already understand the extinction of the mind of provisional names and conditions. What is the mind of dharma now, and how should it be extinguished?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c08_17']	答曰：	答曰：	012	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c09_7']	有實五陰心名為法心。	有實五陰心名為法心。	012	The real five aggregates are called the mind of dharma.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c10_3']	善修空智見五陰空，法心則滅。	善修空智見五陰空，法心則滅。	012	Cultivating the wisdom of emptiness well, seeing the five aggregates as empty, the mind of dharma will then be extinguished.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c10_6']	問曰：	問曰：	012	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c11_18']	行者觀五陰空，謂五陰中無常法、定法、不壞法、不變法、我我所法。	行者觀五陰空，謂五陰中無常法、定法、不壞法、不變法、我我所法。	012	When practitioners contemplate the emptiness of the five aggregates, they think that within the five aggregates there are no permanent dharmas, definite dharmas, indestructible dharmas, unchanging dharmas, or dharmas of self and what belongs to self.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c12_11']	以無此法故言其空，非不見五陰。	以無此法故言其空，非不見五陰。	012	Because these dharmas do not exist, it is said to be empty, not that the five aggregates are not seen.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c12_14']	答曰：	答曰：	012	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c13_3']	行者亦不見五陰。	行者亦不見五陰。	012	Practitioners also do not see the five aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c13_8']	所以者何？	所以者何？	012	Why is it so?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c14_17']	行者斷有為緣心，得無為緣心，是故行者不見五陰，但見陰滅。	行者斷有為緣心，得無為緣心，是故行者不見五陰，但見陰滅。	012	The practitioner cuts off the mind that takes conditioned things as objects and attains the mind that takes unconditioned things as objects. Therefore, the practitioner does not see the five aggregates, but only sees the cessation of the aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c16_7']	又若見五陰，則不名為空，以陰不空故，如是空智則不具足。	又若見五陰，則不名為空，以陰不空故，如是空智則不具足。	012	Moreover, if one sees the five aggregates, it cannot be called emptiness, because the aggregates are not empty. In this way, the wisdom of emptiness is not complete.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c16_10']	問曰：	問曰：	012	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c17_7']	行者見色，以無我故空，如經中說：	行者見色，以無我故空，如經中說：	012	The practitioner sees form as empty because of the absence of self. As it is said in the sutra:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c18_2']	行者見此色空乃至見此識空。	行者見此色空乃至見此識空。	012	The practitioner sees this form as empty, up to seeing this consciousness as empty.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c18_11']	當知非無色等諸陰。	當知非無色等諸陰。	012	One should know that it is not the absence of form and other aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c18_14']	答曰：	答曰：	012	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c19_6']	有如是言，但非清淨。	有如是言，但非清淨。	012	There are such words, but they are not pure.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c19_15']	如《法印經》中說：	如《法印經》中說：	012	As the Dharma Seal Sutra says:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c21_3']	行者見色等無常敗壞虛誑厭離之相，是亦名空，但未是清淨。	行者見色等無常敗壞虛誑厭離之相，是亦名空，但未是清淨。	012	The practitioner sees the characteristics of impermanence, decay, falsity, and detachment in form and so forth. This is also called emptiness, but it is not yet pure.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c22_5']	是人於後見五陰滅，是觀乃淨，故知見諸陰滅。	是人於後見五陰滅，是觀乃淨，故知見諸陰滅。	012	This person later sees the cessation of the five aggregates. This contemplation is then pure. Therefore, one should know that one sees the cessation of the aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c22_8']	問曰：	問曰：	012	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c23_2']	以有為緣智何故不得清淨？	以有為緣智何故不得清淨？	012	Why is the wisdom that takes conditioned things as objects not able to attain purity?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c23_5']	答曰：	答曰：	012	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c24_13']	行者或時起五陰相，故假名心還生，是故有為緣心不得清淨。	行者或時起五陰相，故假名心還生，是故有為緣心不得清淨。	012	The practitioner may sometimes give rise to the characteristics of the five aggregates, and therefore the nominal mind is reborn. Therefore, the conditioned mind that takes the five aggregates as its object cannot be purified.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c26_6']	若證諸陰滅，則五陰不復現前，成假名因緣滅故，假名想則不隨逐。	若證諸陰滅，則五陰不復現前，成假名因緣滅故，假名想則不隨逐。	012	If one realizes the cessation of the five aggregates, then the five aggregates will no longer appear before one. Because the causes and conditions for the nominal designation cease, the conceptualization of nominal designation will no longer follow.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c27_16']	譬如有樹，剪伐焚燒灰炭都盡，樹想乃滅不復隨逐，是事亦爾。	譬如有樹，剪伐焚燒灰炭都盡，樹想乃滅不復隨逐，是事亦爾。	012	It is like a tree that is cut down, burned, and reduced to ashes and charcoal, and the concept of a tree ceases and does not follow again. This matter is also like this.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c28_3']	又佛語羅陀：	又佛語羅陀：	012	Moreover, the Buddha said to Revata:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c28_15']	汝破裂散壞眾生令不現在。	汝破裂散壞眾生令不現在。	012	You should break up and destroy sentient beings so that they do not appear.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0332c29_3']	又一經說：	又一經說：	012	Also, a sutra says:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a01_2']	汝羅陀破裂散壞色乃至識令不現在。	汝羅陀破裂散壞色乃至識令不現在。	012	You, Revata, should break up and destroy form and so on up to consciousness so that they do not appear.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a02_4']	故知若壞眾生是假名空，若破壞色是名法空。	故知若壞眾生是假名空，若破壞色是名法空。	012	Therefore, we know that if one destroys sentient beings, it is the emptiness of nominal designation. If one destroys form, it is called the emptiness of dharmas.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a02_16']	又二種觀，空觀、無我觀。	又二種觀，空觀、無我觀。	012	Moreover, there are two kinds of contemplation: the contemplation of emptiness and the contemplation of non-self.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a03_5']	空觀者，不見假名眾生。	空觀者，不見假名眾生。	012	The contemplation of emptiness is not seeing nominal sentient beings.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a04_9']	如人見瓶以無水故空，如是見五陰中無人故空。	如人見瓶以無水故空，如是見五陰中無人故空。	012	It is like a person seeing a vase as empty because it is without water. In the same way, one sees the five aggregates as empty because there is no person in them.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a05_1']	若不見法，是名無我。	若不見法，是名無我。	012	If one does not see dharmas, this is called no-self.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a05_6']	又經中說：	又經中說：	012	Moreover, a sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a05_15']	得無我智則正解脫。	得無我智則正解脫。	012	Attaining the wisdom of no-self is true liberation.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a07_2']	故知色性滅、受想行識性滅，是名無我，無我即是無性。	故知色性滅、受想行識性滅，是名無我，無我即是無性。	012	Therefore, know that the cessation of the nature of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness is called no-self, and no-self is precisely no-nature.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a07_5']	問曰：	問曰：	012	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a08_2']	若以無性名無我者，今五陰實無耶？	若以無性名無我者，今五陰實無耶？	012	If using no-nature is called no-self, are the five aggregates now truly non-existent?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a08_5']	答曰：	答曰：	012	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a08_16']	五陰實無，以世諦故有。	五陰實無，以世諦故有。	012	The five aggregates are truly non-existent, but exist due to conventional truth.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a09_1']	所以者何？	所以者何？	012	Why is this?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a10_6']	佛說諸行盡皆如幻如化，以世諦故有，非實有也。	佛說諸行盡皆如幻如化，以世諦故有，非實有也。	012	The Buddha said that all conditioned phenomena are like illusions and transformations, existing due to conventional truth, not truly existing.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a11_12']	又經中說第一義空，此義以第一義諦故空，非世諦故空。	又經中說第一義空，此義以第一義諦故空，非世諦故空。	012	Moreover, a sūtra says about ultimate truth emptiness, this meaning is empty due to ultimate truth, not empty due to conventional truth.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a12_13']	第一義者，所謂色空無所有，乃至識空無所有。	第一義者，所謂色空無所有，乃至識空無所有。	012	Ultimate truth refers to the emptiness and non-existence of form, up to the emptiness and non-existence of consciousness.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a13_13']	是故若人觀色等法空，是名見第一義空。	是故若人觀色等法空，是名見第一義空。	012	Therefore, if a person observes the emptiness of dharmas such as form, this is called seeing ultimate truth emptiness.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a13_16']	問曰：	問曰：	012	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a14_17']	若五陰以世諦故有，何故說色等法是真諦耶？	若五陰以世諦故有，何故說色等法是真諦耶？	012	If the five aggregates exist due to conventional truth, why is it said that form and other dharmas are ultimate truth?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a15_2']	答曰：	答曰：	012	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a15_8']	為眾生故說。	為眾生故說。	012	It is said for the sake of sentient beings.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a16_14']	有人於五陰中生真實想，為是故說五陰以第一義故空。	有人於五陰中生真實想，為是故說五陰以第一義故空。	012	There are people who give rise to the conception of true reality within the five aggregates. For this reason, it is said that the five aggregates are empty in the ultimate sense.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a16_17']	問曰：	問曰：	012	Question:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a17_16']	經中不說有業有果報，但作者不可得耶？	經中不說有業有果報，但作者不可得耶？	012	In the sutras, is it not said that there is karma and there are karmic retributions, but that the doer cannot be apprehended?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a18_1']	答曰：	答曰：	012	Answer:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a19_1']	此因諸法說作者不可得，是說假名空。	此因諸法說作者不可得，是說假名空。	012	This is based on the dharmas, saying that the doer cannot be apprehended, which is the teaching of the emptiness of provisional names.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a19_6']	如經中說：	如經中說：	012	As it is said in the sutras:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a19_13']	諸法但假名字。	諸法但假名字。	012	All dharmas are merely provisional names.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a20_15']	假名字者，所謂無明因緣諸行乃至老死諸苦集滅。	假名字者，所謂無明因緣諸行乃至老死諸苦集滅。	012	The provisional names refer to the arising of old age and death through the conditions of ignorance, up to the arising of the collection and cessation of suffering.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a21_12']	以此語故，知五陰亦第一義故無。	以此語故，知五陰亦第一義故無。	012	For this reason, it is known that the five aggregates also do not exist in the ultimate sense.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a21_21']	又《大空經》中說：	又《大空經》中說：	012	Moreover, in the Mahāśūnyatā-sūtra it is said:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a23_13']	若人言此老死、某老死，若人說身即是神、若說身異神異，此言異而義同。	若人言此老死、某老死，若人說身即是神、若說身異神異，此言異而義同。	012	If someone says this old age and death, or that old age and death, or if someone says the body is the self, or if they say the body is different from the self, these statements are different but the meaning is the same.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a24_9']	若有此見，非我弟子、非梵行者。	若有此見，非我弟子、非梵行者。	012	If one has this view, they are not my disciples and are not practitioners of the holy life.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a25_11']	若遮某老死則破假名，遮此老死則破五陰。	若遮某老死則破假名，遮此老死則破五陰。	012	If one denies old age and death of a certain person, then one destroys conventional truth. If one denies this old age and death, then one destroys the five aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a27_6']	又說生緣老死名為中道，當知第一義故說無老死，世諦故說生緣老死。	又說生緣老死名為中道，當知第一義故說無老死，世諦故說生緣老死。	012	Moreover, it is said that birth being a condition for old age and death is called the middle way. One should know that it is because of ultimate truth that there is no old age and death, and it is because of conventional truth that birth is said to be a condition for old age and death.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a28_17']	又如過瓶相則第一義故無瓶，如是過色等法則第一義故無色。	又如過瓶相則第一義故無瓶，如是過色等法則第一義故無色。	012	Moreover, just as the characteristics of a past pot are non-existent because of ultimate truth, in the same way, form and so forth are non-existent because of ultimate truth.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333a29_4']	又經中說：	又經中說：	012	Moreover, a sūtra says:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b01_3']	若法是誑即是虛妄，若法非誑即名為實。	若法是誑即是虛妄，若法非誑即名為實。	012	If a dharma is deceptive, then it is false. If a dharma is not deceptive, then it is called real.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b02_11']	諸有為法皆變異，故悉名為誑，誑故虛妄，虛妄故非真實有。	諸有為法皆變異，故悉名為誑，誑故虛妄，虛妄故非真實有。	012	Because conditioned dharmas all change, they are all called deceptive. Because they are deceptive, they are false. Because they are false, they do not truly exist.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b02_15']	如偈說：	如偈說：	012	As a verse says:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b03_0']	「世間虛妄縛，　　狀如決定相，	「世間虛妄縛，　　狀如決定相，	012	The world is bound by falsehood, appearing as if with definite characteristics,
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b04_13']	實無見似有，　　深觀則皆無。	實無見似有，　　深觀則皆無。	012	Truly seen to be non-existent, deeply contemplated, all are non-existent.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b05_6']	」當知諸陰亦空。	」當知諸陰亦空。	012	One should know that the aggregates are also empty.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b06_12']	又見滅諦故說名得道，故知滅是第一義有，非諸陰也。	又見滅諦故說名得道，故知滅是第一義有，非諸陰也。	012	Also, because of seeing the truth of cessation, it is said that one attains the path. Therefore, we know that cessation exists as the ultimate truth, not the aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b08_4']	若諸陰實有，行者亦應見而得道，而實不然，故知五陰非第一義有。	若諸陰實有，行者亦應見而得道，而實不然，故知五陰非第一義有。	012	If the aggregates truly exist, practitioners should also see them and attain the path. But this is not so in reality. Therefore, we know that the five aggregates do not exist as the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b09_12']	又以陰滅為實，故知諸陰非實，不可言諸陰是實、無陰亦實。	又以陰滅為實，故知諸陰非實，不可言諸陰是實、無陰亦實。	012	Moreover, because the cessation of the aggregates is taken as real, we know that the aggregates are not real. It cannot be said that the aggregates are real and the absence of aggregates is also real.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b10_15']	又所有見法皆以癡故，如人眼不可誑則不見幻。	又所有見法皆以癡故，如人眼不可誑則不見幻。	012	Moreover, all views of dharmas are due to delusion. Just as a person whose eyes cannot be deceived does not see illusions.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b12_3']	如是若無愚癡則不見諸陰，是故諸陰非第一義有。	如是若無愚癡則不見諸陰，是故諸陰非第一義有。	012	In the same way, if there were no delusion, one would not see the aggregates. Therefore, the aggregates do not exist as the ultimate truth.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b12_8']	又經中說：	又經中說：	012	Moreover, a sutra says:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b13_3']	隨有我即是動處，而陰中有我。	隨有我即是動處，而陰中有我。	012	Wherever there is a self, there is movement. But there is a self within the aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b13_8']	如阿難說：	如阿難說：	012	As Ananda said:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b14_3']	因法成我，謂因色陰乃至識陰。	因法成我，謂因色陰乃至識陰。	012	The self is formed based on dharmas, namely based on the form aggregate up to the consciousness aggregate.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b14_15']	又如諸上座比丘問差摩伽：	又如諸上座比丘問差摩伽：	012	Also, as the elder bhikshus asked Dharmagupta:
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b15_4']	汝說何事為我？	汝說何事為我？	012	What do you say is the self?
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b15_9']	差摩伽言：	差摩伽言：	012	Dharmagupta said:🔽The self is the five aggregates.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b17_4']	我不說色是我、不說離色是我，乃至識亦如是，但於五陰中我慢未斷。	我不說色是我、不說離色是我，乃至識亦如是，但於五陰中我慢未斷。	012	I do not say that form is the self, nor do I say that apart from form there is the self, and so on up to consciousness. It is only that the conceit of 'I' and 'mine' has not yet been eliminated.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b18_17']	此經意以學人或時散亂念故則起我慢，若攝心念，五陰滅我慢即滅。	此經意以學人或時散亂念故則起我慢，若攝心念，五陰滅我慢即滅。	012	The meaning of this sutra is that the practitioner sometimes gives rise to the conceit of 'I' and 'mine' due to scattered thoughts, but if the mind is concentrated and mindful, the five aggregates cease and the conceit of 'I' and 'mine' also ceases.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b19_16']	如花非但根莖枝葉為華，亦不離此為華。	如花非但根莖枝葉為華，亦不離此為華。	012	It is like a flower that is not the flower by means of the root, stem, branches, and leaves, nor is it the flower apart from these.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b20_14']	如是非色等是我，亦不離色等是我。	如是非色等是我，亦不離色等是我。	012	It is like this: form, etc. are not the self, nor is the self apart from form, etc.
['ZH_T32_1646_012:0333b21_16']	如是滅我因緣則我慢不起，故知諸陰亦空。	如是滅我因緣則我慢不起，故知諸陰亦空。	012	In this way, when the causes of the conceit of 'I' and 'mine' cease, the conceit of 'I' and 'mine' does not arise. Therefore, we know that the aggregates are also empty.

It is not said that the five factors are the nature of the first dhyāna. Because there is this initial and sustained thought in the proximate stage of the first dhyāna, it is called a factor.

['ZH_T32_1646_012:0340c23_15']	覺觀亦爾，是初禪因。	覺觀亦爾，是初禪因。	012	Reflection and investigation are also like this, being the causes of the first dhyāna.

The second dhyāna also does not give rise to reflection and investigation in sequence.

It arises next to reflection and investigation from the first dhyāna, and because it is mixed with reflection and investigation, it is called together.

['ZH_T32_1646_012:0341a11_19']	又無別猗法，但喜生時身心無麁重法，柔軟調適，故名曰猗。	又無別猗法，但喜生時身心無麁重法，柔軟調適，故名曰猗。	012	Moreover, there is no separate dharma of serenity. It is only when joy arises that the body and mind are free from the dharma of coarseness and heaviness, and become pliable and comfortable, so it is called serenity.

Therefore, there is no separate dharma of serenity.

['ZH_T32_1646_012:0341a22_7']	故知初禪應有覺觀。	故知初禪應有覺觀。	012	Therefore, we know that the first dhyāna should have initial and sustained thought.
