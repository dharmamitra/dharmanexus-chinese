['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0759c02_12']	五十九文據正潤說。	五十九文據正潤說。	the text of the fifty-ninth [chapter] speaks from the perspective of proper nourishing.🔽There is no contradiction.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0759c03_5']	亦不相違　如實義者。	亦不相違　如實義者。	According to the true meaning,
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0759c03_15']	凡夫二果俱種．現潤。	凡夫二果俱種．現潤。	ordinary beings and those of the two fruits both nourish with seeds and actual [attachment].🔽The text is as explained above.

['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0759c07_15']	為於二位俱起二愛。	為於二位俱起二愛。	Does one give rise to two kinds of craving in both states?
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0759c08_11']	為不爾耶　答潤中有起自體愛。	為不爾耶　答潤中有起自體愛。	Or is it not so? The answer is: In moistening the intermediate state, one gives rise to craving for one's own body.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0759c09_3']	潤生有起境界愛。	潤生有起境界愛。	In moistening the state of birth, one gives rise to craving for external objects.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0759c09_12']	以於死有不見中有。	以於死有不見中有。	Because in the state of death, one does not see the intermediate state.

Answer: Because they are spoken of according to the general categories, they are only divided into three grades. Question: According to the severing of the nine grades of afflictions,
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c09_4']	有九無間九解脫道。	有九無間九解脫道。	there are nine uninterrupted paths and nine paths of liberation.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c10_1']	何故但三名為斷耶　答有二解。	何故但三名為斷耶　答有二解。	Why are they only called three in terms of severing? Answer: There are two explanations.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c10_12']	一云此三作意各各斷三。	一云此三作意各各斷三。	The first says that each of these three intentions severs three [grades of afflictions].
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c11_3']	行相品類皆相似故。	行相品類皆相似故。	Because the aspects and categories are all similar,
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c11_8']	論不別說。	論不別說。	the treatise does not explain them separately.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c12_2']	一云惑雖九品但三品斷。	一云惑雖九品但三品斷。	The second says that although the afflictions are nine grades, they are only severed in three grades,
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c12_11']	以其世道有三品故。	以其世道有三品故。	because the worldly path has three grades.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c13_3']	諸論皆唯說三品斷。	諸論皆唯說三品斷。	All the treatises only speak of severing in three grades,
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c14_1']	非九品故　問依前說中斷下品惑。	非九品故　問依前說中斷下品惑。	not in nine grades. Question: According to the previous explanation, in severing the lower grade of afflictions,
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c14_14']	復分三品斷第三品可名究竟。	復分三品斷第三品可名究竟。	Furthermore, they are divided into three grades. The third grade of afflictions that are eliminated can be called ultimate.🔽What is meant by ultimate in the elimination of the first and middle two grades of afflictions?
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c15_16']	斷初中二何名究竟　答非望自類三品而說。	斷初中二何名究竟　答非望自類三品而說。	It is not said with reference to the three grades of afflictions of the same type.

['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c16_17']	下三總是下品故名究竟。	下三總是下品故名究竟。	The lower three grades are all of the lower grade, therefore it is called ultimate.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c18_2']	不爾何故瑜伽．雜集俱但說究竟斷下品惑耶。	不爾何故瑜伽．雜集俱但說究竟斷下品惑耶。	Otherwise, why do the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra and the Abhidharmasamuccaya only speak of the ultimate elimination of the lower grade of afflictions?🔽If we rely on the second interpretation, there is no problem here.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c19_4']	依第二解即無此妨　問斷下品中前二品惑。	依第二解即無此妨　問斷下品中前二品惑。	In the elimination of the lower grade of afflictions, the first two grades of afflictions,🔽what kind of mental state is used as the path of liberation?

['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c26_1']	為三無間二解脫道。	為三無間二解脫道。	It serves as the two uninterrupted paths and two paths of liberation.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c26_10']	以名體同論不別說。	以名體同論不別說。	Because the name and essence are the same, the treatise does not discuss them separately.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c26_14']	此應好。	此應好。	This is the better explanation.🔽The mental state of delight in seclusion can be the four paths for severing the three grades [of afflictions].

['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0760c29_14']	上下二品俱說加行及解脫道。	上下二品俱說加行及解脫道。	The paths of preparation and liberation are discussed for both the upper and lower grades.
['ZH_T43_1832_05b:0761a01_5']	故於中品略而不說。	故於中品略而不說。	Therefore, it is omitted in the middle grade.
