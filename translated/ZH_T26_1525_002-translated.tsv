Although they are oppressed by the sufferings of the world, they do not abandon the tasks of benefiting sentient beings. They sever the root of afflictions such as the view of a real self. At that time, they attain irreversibility from anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.

Seeing that the three realms are burned by the fire of afflictions such as greed and oppressed by impermanence, they become disgusted with the three realms as if their body were burning in a fire. Contemplating the impermanence and other conditioned activities of the five aggregates, they eventually become free from the bonds of the three realms, then eliminate afflictions such as greed, gradually becoming less intense and transcending the three realms.
['ZH_T26_1525_002:0238c14_1']	菩薩之人得深心故，常樂利益一切世間，為諸眾生作利益行。	菩薩之人得深心故，常樂利益一切世間，為諸眾生作利益行。	002	Bodhisattvas, having attained the profound mind, always delight in benefiting the entire world and perform beneficial practices for sentient beings.
['ZH_T26_1525_002:0238c15_18']	雖為世間苦惱所逼，以成就方便智慧力故，雖能如實修行聲聞道，而不證聲聞道。	雖為世間苦惱所逼，以成就方便智慧力故，雖能如實修行聲聞道，而不證聲聞道。	002	Although they are oppressed by the sufferings of the world, because they have accomplished the power of skillful means and wisdom, although they are able to practice the path of the śrāvakas in accordance with reality, they do not realize the path of the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T26_1525_002:0238c16_10']	以先斷所障取聲聞位法故。	以先斷所障取聲聞位法故。	002	Because they have already eliminated the dharmas that obstruct the attainment of the stage of the śrāvakas.
['ZH_T26_1525_002:0238c17_1']	何者是取聲聞位法？	何者是取聲聞位法？	002	What are the dharmas that lead to the attainment of the stage of the śrāvakas?
['ZH_T26_1525_002:0238c17_16']	謂捨大悲心，不能增長大悲等行。	謂捨大悲心，不能增長大悲等行。	002	It refers to abandoning the mind of great compassion and being unable to increase the practices such as great compassion.
['ZH_T26_1525_002:0238c19_4']	若諸菩薩得深心等修行菩提心眷屬等法，能作證菩提位因。	若諸菩薩得深心等修行菩提心眷屬等法，能作證菩提位因。	002	If bodhisattvas attain the dharmas that are the retinue of the mind of enlightenment such as the profound mind and so forth, they are able to realize the causes for the stage of enlightenment.
['ZH_T26_1525_002:0238c20_16']	彼時菩薩見一切法故，能增長菩提心力，方便推求利益一切眾生之事。	彼時菩薩見一切法故，能增長菩提心力，方便推求利益一切眾生之事。	002	At that time, because the bodhisattvas see all dharmas, they are able to increase the power of the mind of enlightenment and skillfully seek the matters that benefit all sentient beings.

Because they see the dharma realm, they immediately distance themselves from all the afflictions that are to be eliminated by the path of seeing, and they attain the mind of great enlightenment that is ultimately irreversible.

Because the bodhisattva-mahāsattva always practices with a profound mind for the benefit of others, he thus, at the time of seeing the path, cuts off all afflictions in the three realms, while śrāvakas and others have not previously cultivated the skillful means of loving-kindness and compassion. Therefore, they lack the practice of benefiting others and gradually cut off afflictions, later attaining arhatship.
