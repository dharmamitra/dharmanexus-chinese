['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b07_15']	復次分別生滅相者，有二種。	復次分別生滅相者，有二種。	Next, as for distinguishing the characteristics of arising and ceasing, there are two kinds.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b08_2']	云何為二？	云何為二？	What are the two?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b09_3']	一者麁與心相應故、二者細與心不相應故。	一者麁與心相應故、二者細與心不相應故。	First, the coarse, because it is associated with the mind; second, the subtle, because it is not associated with the mind.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b10_17']	又麁中之麁凡夫境界，麁中之細及細中之麁菩薩境界，細中之細是佛境界。	又麁中之麁凡夫境界，麁中之細及細中之麁菩薩境界，細中之細是佛境界。	Moreover, the coarsest of the coarse is the realm of ordinary beings, the coarsest of the subtle and the subtlest of the coarse are the realms of bodhisattvas, and the subtlest of the subtle is the realm of buddhas.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b12_2']	此二種生滅，依於無明熏習而有，所謂依因、依緣。	此二種生滅，依於無明熏習而有，所謂依因、依緣。	These two kinds of arising and ceasing exist due to the perfuming of ignorance, namely, depending on causes and depending on conditions.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b12_11']	依因者，不覺義故；	依因者，不覺義故；	As for depending on causes, it is because of the meaning of non-enlightenment;
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b13_2']	依緣者，妄作境界義故。	依緣者，妄作境界義故。	as for depending on conditions, it is because of the meaning of falsely creating objects.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b14_6']	若因滅則緣滅，因滅故不相應心滅，緣滅故相應心滅。	若因滅則緣滅，因滅故不相應心滅，緣滅故相應心滅。	If the cause ceases, then the conditions cease. Because the cause ceases, the unassociated mind ceases. Because the conditions cease, the associated mind ceases.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b14_9']	問曰：	問曰：	Question:
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b14_19']	若心滅者，云何相續？	若心滅者，云何相續？	If the mind is extinguished, how can there be continuity?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b15_10']	若相續者，云何說究竟滅？	若相續者，云何說究竟滅？	If there is continuity, how can it be said to be ultimately extinguished?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b15_13']	答曰：	答曰：	The answer is:
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b16_8']	所言滅者，唯心相滅，非心體滅。	所言滅者，唯心相滅，非心體滅。	What is called extinction is only the extinction of the mind's characteristics, not the extinction of the mind's essence.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b17_13']	如風依水而有動相，若波水滅者，則風斷絕無所依止。	如風依水而有動相，若波水滅者，則風斷絕無所依止。	Just as wind relies on water to have a moving appearance, if the waves and water were extinguished, then the wind would be cut off and have no basis to rely on.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b18_18']	以水不滅風相相續，唯風滅故動相隨滅，非是水滅。	以水不滅風相相續，唯風滅故動相隨滅，非是水滅。	Because the water is not extinguished, the wind's appearance continues. It is only because the wind is extinguished that the moving appearance follows and is extinguished, not because the water is extinguished.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0632b21_9']	無明亦爾，依心體而動，若心體滅則眾生斷絕無所依止，以體不滅心得相續，唯癡滅故心相隨滅，非心智滅。	無明亦爾，依心體而動，若心體滅則眾生斷絕無所依止，以體不滅心得相續，唯癡滅故心相隨滅，非心智滅。	Ignorance is also like this. It relies on the mind's essence to move. If the mind's essence were extinguished, then sentient beings would be cut off and have no basis to rely on. Because the essence is not extinguished, the mind can continue. It is only because delusion is extinguished that the mind's characteristics follow and are extinguished, not because the mind's wisdom is extinguished.

One part of the karma-consciousness is taken as its own object, as the root text says, “the coarse within the subtle and the subtle within the coarse are the realm of the bodhisattvas.”

['ZH_T32_1668_005:0636a09_16']	以此力故，即熏習真如性，自信佛性入十信位，知心虛妄入十解位，知境界空入十行位，修出向法入十向位。	以此力故，即熏習真如性，自信佛性入十信位，知心虛妄入十解位，知境界空入十行位，修出向法入十向位。	Because of this power, one perfumes the nature of suchness, and one has confidence in one's own buddha-nature and enters the stage of the ten faiths. Knowing that the mind is illusory, one enters the stage of the ten understandings. Knowing that the objective realm is empty, one enters the stage of the ten practices. Cultivating the methods of progress, one enters the stage of the ten dedications.

Without grasping at nirvāṇa, without thinking of saṃsāra, one enters the stage of extreme joy and so forth up to the vajra stage.

Because the fundamental black category and its branches are nonexistent, one attains the nirvāṇa of the Dharma body and accomplishes the activities and functions of response and transformation. This is called the beginning stage.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0636a16_9']	如本以熏習因緣力故，則令妄心厭生死苦、樂求涅盤。	如本以熏習因緣力故，則令妄心厭生死苦、樂求涅盤。	As the scripture says, By the power of the causes and conditions of perfuming, it causes the deluded mind to be weary of the suffering of birth and death and joyfully seek nirvāṇa.

Because of truly knowing the absence of a prior realm, one gives rise to practices in accordance with various expedient means, not grasping or thinking, and so forth. Because of the power of long-distance perfuming, ignorance then ceases. Because of the cessation of ignorance, the mind does not arise. Because of non-arising, the realm ceases accordingly. Because of the cessation of both causes and conditions, the characteristics of the mind are all exhausted, and it is called attaining nirvana and accomplishing natural karma.

['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638b24_6']	此別說中即有三門。	此別說中即有三門。	Within these separate explanations, there are three approaches.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638b24_11']	云何為三？	云何為三？	What are the three?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638b26_3']	一者緣闕單因無力門、二者因闕單緣無力門、三者因緣具足圓成門。	一者緣闕單因無力門、二者因闕單緣無力門、三者因緣具足圓成門。	First, the approach of the single cause lacking conditions and being powerless; second, the approach of the single condition lacking causes and being powerless; third, the approach of the causes and conditions being complete and perfect.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638b28_2']	緣闕單因無力門者，譬如雖木中火性從本已來有伏藏火，而不假方便，無以得火。	緣闕單因無力門者，譬如雖木中火性從本已來有伏藏火，而不假方便，無以得火。	As for the approach of the single cause lacking conditions and being powerless, it is like how although the nature of fire has existed in wood from the beginning, without relying on skillful means, fire cannot be obtained.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c01_3']	如是雖無明藏中如來之性，從本已來有自性清淨心，而不待修行之功無以得佛故。	如是雖無明藏中如來之性，從本已來有自性清淨心，而不待修行之功無以得佛故。	In the same way, although the nature of the Tathāgata exists in the storehouse of ignorance, the intrinsically pure mind has existed from the beginning, but without relying on the power of cultivation, Buddhahood cannot be attained.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c03_10']	如本雖有正因熏習之力，若不遇諸佛菩薩善知識等以之為緣，能自斷煩惱入涅槃者則無是處故。	如本雖有正因熏習之力，若不遇諸佛菩薩善知識等以之為緣，能自斷煩惱入涅槃者則無是處故。	As the treatise states, Although there is the power of perfuming from the correct cause, if one does not encounter the conditions of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and good and virtuous friends, one will not be able to sever afflictions and enter nirvāṇa by oneself. This is impossible.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c05_8']	因闕單緣無力門者，譬如有人雖具足方便，而彼木中若無火性，終不得火。	因闕單緣無力門者，譬如有人雖具足方便，而彼木中若無火性，終不得火。	As for the cause lacking the single condition of the powerless gate, it is like a person who, although fully endowed with skillful means, if there is no fire nature in the wood, they will never obtain fire.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c07_7']	如是一切行者，雖具修行無量方便，而眾生心中若無本覺佛性，終不得佛故。	如是一切行者，雖具修行無量方便，而眾生心中若無本覺佛性，終不得佛故。	In the same way, although all practitioners are fully endowed with the practice of immeasurable skillful means, if there is no originally enlightened Buddha nature in the minds of sentient beings, they will never attain Buddhahood.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c09_9']	如本若雖有外緣之力，而內淨法未有熏習力者，亦不能究竟厭生死苦、樂求涅盤故。	如本若雖有外緣之力，而內淨法未有熏習力者，亦不能究竟厭生死苦、樂求涅盤故。	As the treatise states: Even if there is the power of external conditions, if the power of inner pure dharmas has not yet been cultivated, one will still be unable to ultimately detest the suffering of birth and death and delight in seeking nirvana.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c11_2']	因緣具足圓成門者，譬如木中有火性亦具方便，火炎出現燒木無餘。	因緣具足圓成門者，譬如木中有火性亦具方便，火炎出現燒木無餘。	As for the gate of perfect completion with the full complement of causes and conditions, it is like the fire nature within the wood also being fully endowed with skillful means, with the fire flames appearing and burning the wood without remainder.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c13_15']	因緣具足者亦復如是，內中有本覺之佛性、外中具修行之功能，圓百行之因、滿萬德之果，三智俱行、四德雙開。	因緣具足者亦復如是，內中有本覺之佛性、外中具修行之功能，圓百行之因、滿萬德之果，三智俱行、四德雙開。	It is the same with the full complement of causes and conditions: within there is the Buddha nature of original enlightenment, and without there is the functional ability of practice, perfecting the causes of the hundred practices and fulfilling the fruits of the myriad virtues, with the three knowledges proceeding together and the four virtues opening up in tandem.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c17_17']	如本若因緣具足者，所謂自有熏習之力，又為諸佛菩薩等慈悲願護故，能起厭苦之心，信有涅盤修習善根，以修善根成就則值諸佛菩薩示教利喜，乃能進趣向涅盤道故。	如本若因緣具足者，所謂自有熏習之力，又為諸佛菩薩等慈悲願護故，能起厭苦之心，信有涅盤修習善根，以修善根成就則值諸佛菩薩示教利喜，乃能進趣向涅盤道故。	As the text says, When the conditions are complete, namely, one has the power of one's own perfuming, and is also protected by the compassionate vows of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, one is able to give rise to the mind that is weary of suffering, to believe in the existence of nirvana, and to cultivate the roots of goodness. By perfecting the cultivation of goodness, one then encounters the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who instruct, benefit, and delight one, and one is thus able to progress and head towards the path of nirvana.

['ZH_T32_1668_005:0638c29_17']	一者能緣之人、二者所緣之境。	一者能緣之人、二者所緣之境。	First, the person who conditions; second, the objects that are conditioned.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a01_7']	能緣人者其分齊云何？	能緣人者其分齊云何？	What is the scope of the person who conditions?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a02_11']	所謂發心以為其初，如來之地以為其後，能作此緣。	所謂發心以為其初，如來之地以為其後，能作此緣。	It refers to those who arouse the mind of enlightenment at the beginning and attain the stage of Tathāgata at the end, and are able to create these conditions.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a03_2']	所緣境者其分齊云何？	所緣境者其分齊云何？	What is the scope of the objects that are conditioned?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a04_8']	所謂通於邪定、不定二種眾生故，復次通於正定聚故。	所謂通於邪定、不定二種眾生故，復次通於正定聚故。	It is said that it is because it penetrates both the heterodox and indeterminate types of sentient beings, and also because it penetrates the correct determination category.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a10_3']	如本差別緣者，此人依於諸佛菩薩等，從初發意始求道時乃至得佛於中，若見若念，或為眷屬父母諸親、或為給使、或為知友、或為怨家、或起四攝，乃至一切所作無量行緣，以起大悲熏習之力，能令眾生增長善根，若見若聞得利益故故。	如本差別緣者，此人依於諸佛菩薩等，從初發意始求道時乃至得佛於中，若見若念，或為眷屬父母諸親、或為給使、或為知友、或為怨家、或起四攝，乃至一切所作無量行緣，以起大悲熏習之力，能令眾生增長善根，若見若聞得利益故故。	As the treatise states, The discriminating conditions refer to this person relying on the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and so forth. From the initial arousal of the intention to seek the Way until attaining buddhahood, in the meantime, whether seeing or thinking of them, sometimes as relatives, parents, or kin, sometimes as servants, sometimes as acquaintances, sometimes as enemies, sometimes giving rise to the four means of gathering [disciples], and so forth, up to all the immeasurable conditioned conditions, by giving rise to the power of the perfuming of great compassion, it is able to cause sentient beings to increase their roots of goodness, whether seeing or hearing, and attain benefit.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a12_6']	自此已下明善根已成熟未成熟之差別，謂有眾生善根已熟，應化之身即便應時速令得度。	自此已下明善根已成熟未成熟之差別，謂有眾生善根已熟，應化之身即便應時速令得度。	From here below clarifies the distinction between those whose roots of goodness are already mature and those whose roots of goodness are not yet mature. It means that there are sentient beings whose roots of goodness are already mature, and the body that should transform them will immediately respond in a timely manner to quickly enable them to attain liberation.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a13_10']	亦有眾生善根未熟，應化之身時節久遠令使得度。	亦有眾生善根未熟，應化之身時節久遠令使得度。	There are also sentient beings whose roots of goodness are not yet mature, and the body that should transform them will do so over a long period of time to enable them to attain liberation.

['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a15_5']	一者近緣速得度故、二者遠緣久遠得度故故。	一者近緣速得度故、二者遠緣久遠得度故故。	First, proximate conditions that quickly lead to liberation, and second, distant conditions that lead to liberation after a long time.

['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a23_9']	云何為二？	云何為二？	What are the two?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a23_19']	一者是總、二者是別。	一者是總、二者是別。	First, the general, and second, the specific.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a26_6']	總說中言平等緣者，一切諸佛菩薩皆願度脫一切眾生，自然熏習恒常不捨者，即是慈悲願力緣焉。	總說中言平等緣者，一切諸佛菩薩皆願度脫一切眾生，自然熏習恒常不捨者，即是慈悲願力緣焉。	In the general explanation, the phrase equally conditioned means that all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas vow to deliver all sentient beings, and naturally pervade them, never abandoning them. This refers to the conditioning of compassion, vows, and power.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639a29_8']	所謂一切諸佛菩薩，於一切時、於一切處，常恒熏習一切無量諸眾生中而能作境，發起伏藏善根之氣常不捨故，以同體智力故。	所謂一切諸佛菩薩，於一切時、於一切處，常恒熏習一切無量諸眾生中而能作境，發起伏藏善根之氣常不捨故，以同體智力故。	That is to say, all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, at all times and in all places, always pervade the immeasurable sentient beings, able to act as objects, giving rise to the latent good roots, and never abandoning them, due to the power of the same essence wisdom.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639b04_1']	隨應見聞而現作業者，即是實行，所謂應化上佛，以隨轉自在無礙之力故，隨時隨處隨宜隨事隨樂，順順如如顯示八種利益之業，教化眾生無有餘故。	隨應見聞而現作業者，即是實行，所謂應化上佛，以隨轉自在無礙之力故，隨時隨處隨宜隨事隨樂，順順如如顯示八種利益之業，教化眾生無有餘故。	According to what should be seen and heard, manifesting activity refers to actual practice. That is to say, the superior Buddha of response and transformation, using the power of unimpeded mastery of transformation, according to time, place, suitability, matter, and inclination, in accordance with suchness, displays the eight kinds of beneficial activities, teaching and transforming sentient beings without remainder.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639b08_5']	所謂眾生依於三昧乃得平等見諸佛故者，即是顯示觀佛正法，謂一切諸佛出現眾生界中，譬如角中毛，重重無數不可說劫，如是雖有無量無邊，而若不修奢摩他者終不見佛。	所謂眾生依於三昧乃得平等見諸佛故者，即是顯示觀佛正法，謂一切諸佛出現眾生界中，譬如角中毛，重重無數不可說劫，如是雖有無量無邊，而若不修奢摩他者終不見佛。	As for sentient beings rely on samādhi to attain the equality of seeing all buddhas, this reveals the correct Dharma of contemplating the buddhas, which means that all buddhas appear in the realm of sentient beings, like hair in a horn, with countless and indescribable kalpas, thus, although there are immeasurable and boundless [buddhas], if one does not cultivate śamatha, one will never see the buddhas.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639b11_15']	是故發心已去一切諸菩薩等，以三昧力觀見諸佛法性之身，平等平等無有差別，同一真如同一法身，異唯見自，我自無別，是故說言平等見佛。	是故發心已去一切諸菩薩等，以三昧力觀見諸佛法性之身，平等平等無有差別，同一真如同一法身，異唯見自，我自無別，是故說言平等見佛。	Therefore, all bodhisattvas who have given rise to the aspiration to enlightenment use the power of samādhi to contemplate and see the dharmakāya of all buddhas, equal and equal, without distinction, the same true nature, the same dharma-body, different only in seeing one's own self, with no other self, and therefore it is said that they see the buddhas equally.

['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639b21_3']	云何名為已入正位？	云何名為已入正位？	What is meant by having entered the correct position?
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639b23_9']	謂十地菩薩內得正智外得後智，一分智用與如來等，唯本熏力自然修行，增長真如能滅無明故。	謂十地菩薩內得正智外得後智，一分智用與如來等，唯本熏力自然修行，增長真如能滅無明故。	It refers to bodhisattvas of the ten stages who internally attain correct wisdom and externally attain subsequent wisdom, whose partial wisdom function is equal to that of the Tathāgata, who naturally cultivate according to the power of the fundamental perfuming, and who increase true suchness and can extinguish ignorance.
['ZH_T32_1668_005:0639b26_13']	如本二者已相應，謂法身菩薩得無分別心，與諸佛自體相應故，得自在業修行與智用相應，唯依法力自然修行熏習真如滅無明故。	如本二者已相應，謂法身菩薩得無分別心，與諸佛自體相應故，得自在業修行與智用相應，唯依法力自然修行熏習真如滅無明故。	As the treatise states, Second, those who are already in accord refer to bodhisattvas of the Dharma body who have attained the mind of non-discrimination, because they are in accord with the essence of the buddhas themselves. They attain the practice of sovereign activity and are in accord with the function of wisdom. They only cultivate and habituate true suchness by relying on the power of the Dharma and extinguishing ignorance.
