['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751a29_14']	初四偈總顯地智微妙、二有一偈類地行微、三有一頌寄對彰微、四有一頌喻顯地微。	初四偈總顯地智微妙、二有一偈類地行微、三有一頌寄對彰微、四有一頌喻顯地微。	033	The first four verses generally reveal the subtle wisdom of the stages, the second has one verse comparing the subtle practices of the stages, the third has one verse using analogies to show the subtlety, and the fourth has one verse using metaphors to reveal the subtlety of the stages.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b01_2']	今初，分二：	今初，分二：	033	Now, the first part is divided into two:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b01_16']	初二總顯地獄、後二別顯微相。	初二總顯地獄、後二別顯微相。	033	The first two verses generally reveal the hells, and the latter two specifically reveal the subtle characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b02_8']	今初，正顯地智微妙之相。	今初，正顯地智微妙之相。	033	Now, the first part correctly reveals the subtle characteristics of the wisdom of the stages.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b03_1']	故論云「此偈依何義說？	故論云「此偈依何義說？	033	Therefore, the treatise says, What meaning does this verse rely on to speak?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b03_6']	依智地故。	依智地故。	033	It relies on the stage of wisdom.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b03_12']	」依者據也。	」依者據也。	033	Rely means to depend on.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b03_19']	云何知依智地？	云何知依智地？	033	How do we know it relies on the stage of wisdom?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b06_16']	上來本分、請分皆依智地，後說分中亦說智地，即今此中第六偈云「智起佛境界」亦依智地，明知此顯地智微妙，非別明佛果。	上來本分、請分皆依智地，後說分中亦說智地，即今此中第六偈云「智起佛境界」亦依智地，明知此顯地智微妙，非別明佛果。	033	The preceding section on the fundamental and the section on request both rely on the stage of wisdom. In the section on explanation, the stage of wisdom is also explained. The sixth verse here says The arising of wisdom is the realm of Buddhas also relies on the stage of wisdom. It is clear that this reveals the subtlety of the wisdom of the stages, not separately clarifying the fruition of Buddhahood.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b07_6']	於中論經但有六句：	於中論經但有六句：	033	Among them, the treatise and sūtra only have six sentences:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b08_9']	初二句即此初偈，彼云微難知聖道，非分別離念。	初二句即此初偈，彼云微難知聖道，非分別離念。	033	The first two sentences are this first verse. They say subtle and difficult to know, the holy path, not conceptual, free from thought.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b09_10']	言微妙者，二偈總相，即前地智超言念故。	言微妙者，二偈總相，即前地智超言念故。	033	As for the subtle, the two verses are general characteristics, because the previous stage of wisdom transcends words and thought.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b10_11']	餘皆是別，別中初句是微體，餘皆是微所以。	餘皆是別，別中初句是微體，餘皆是微所以。	033	The rest are all specific. Among the specific, the first sentence is the essence of subtlety, and the rest are all reasons for subtlety.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b10_17']	於中難可知。	於中難可知。	033	Among them, difficult to know.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b11_11']	總顯所以，下六句別顯所以。	總顯所以，下六句別顯所以。	033	Generally reveals the reason, the following six sentences specifically reveal the reason.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b11_18']	論云「云何微？	論云「云何微？	033	The treatise says: What is subtle?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b12_6']	偈言難知聖道故。	偈言難知聖道故。	033	The verse says: because it is difficult to know the holy path.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b13_3']	」此即雙指，謂聖道是體，難知故微也。	」此即雙指，謂聖道是體，難知故微也。	033	This is a double indication. That is to say, the holy path is the essence, and because it is difficult to know, it is subtle.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b13_22']	故《淨名》云「微妙是菩提，諸法難知故。	故《淨名》云「微妙是菩提，諸法難知故。	033	Therefore the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra says, Subtle is bodhi, because dharmas are difficult to know.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b14_4']	」云何難知？	」云何難知？	033	How are they difficult to know?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b14_9']	此有二義：	此有二義：	033	This has two meanings:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b15_3']	一說時難知，口欲辯而辭喪故。	一說時難知，口欲辯而辭喪故。	033	First, when speaking, it is difficult to know, because when the mouth wants to express it, the words are lost.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b15_17']	二證時難知，心將緣而慮息故。	二證時難知，心將緣而慮息故。	033	Second, when realizing it, it is difficult to know, because when the mind is about to contemplate it, thoughts cease.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b16_13']	上大仙道是所證說，大仙是佛故。	上大仙道是所證說，大仙是佛故。	033	The above great sage's path is what is realized and spoken. Because the great sage is the Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b17_16']	言微妙道者是因，修行證智之因，得大仙果故。	言微妙道者是因，修行證智之因，得大仙果故。	033	Subtle path refers to the cause. It is the cause for cultivating and realizing wisdom, because it attains the fruit of the great sage.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b18_14']	六句別顯微所以中，初句即說時難知。	六句別顯微所以中，初句即說時難知。	033	Among the six phrases that specifically illustrate the reason for subtlety, the first phrase is the difficulty of knowing when speaking.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b19_14']	言非念者，非有念慮分別心者之境界故。	言非念者，非有念慮分別心者之境界故。	033	Not thought means it is not the realm of those who have thoughts, considerations, and discriminating minds.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b20_5']	何以非是念慮境耶？	何以非是念慮境耶？	033	Why is it not the realm of thoughts and considerations?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b21_4']	以此地智自體無念故，故云離諸念也。	以此地智自體無念故，故云離諸念也。	033	Because the essence of the wisdom of this ground itself is without thought, therefore it is said to be apart from all thoughts.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b21_18']	由上二義，如是聖道名為甚微。	由上二義，如是聖道名為甚微。	033	Due to the above two meanings, this holy path is called extremely subtle.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b22_16']	下之五句明證時甚微，於中復有總別。	下之五句明證時甚微，於中復有總別。	033	The following five phrases clarify the extreme subtlety of realization, within which there is also a general and specific distinction.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b24_4']	初句為總，求欲證見難證得故，以無見無得方能證故。	初句為總，求欲證見難證得故，以無見無得方能證故。	033	The first sentence is the general statement, seeking to realize the difficult to realize, because only without seeing and attaining can one realize it.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b24_13']	下四句別有四甚微：	下四句別有四甚微：	033	The following four sentences are specific and have four kinds of subtlety:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b25_14']	第一觀行、第二依止、第三清淨、第四功德。	第一觀行、第二依止、第三清淨、第四功德。	033	The first is the subtle observation of practice, the second is the subtle basis, the third is the subtle purity, and the fourth is the subtle merit.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b26_2']	初句即功德甚微。	初句即功德甚微。	033	The first sentence is the subtle merit.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b26_12']	不生者，契理出世故。	不生者，契理出世故。	033	Not arising means in accord with principle and transcending the world.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b28_4']	不滅者，非一往滅，不捨利益眾生事故，即無住涅槃寂用無礙功德。	不滅者，非一往滅，不捨利益眾生事故，即無住涅槃寂用無礙功德。	033	Not ceasing means not ceasing in one direction, not abandoning the matter of benefiting sentient beings, which is the merit of the unobstructed function of quiescence in the nirvāṇa of no abiding.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751b29_12']	次句即清淨甚微，性離煩惱，非先有染後時離故，名為性淨。	次句即清淨甚微，性離煩惱，非先有染後時離故，名為性淨。	033	The next sentence is the subtle purity, the nature being free from afflictions, not first having defilements and then later being free, thus called inherently pure.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c01_13']	如此則無不離時，故恒寂然，即性淨涅槃。	如此則無不離時，故恒寂然，即性淨涅槃。	033	In this way, there is never a time of not being free, thus always quiescent, which is the inherent purity of nirvāṇa.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c03_8']	言離垢者，即觀行甚微，謂觀智中離無明垢故，不同世間八禪為無明雜故。	言離垢者，即觀行甚微，謂觀智中離無明垢故，不同世間八禪為無明雜故。	033	Free from defilements refers to the subtle observation of practice, meaning being free from the defilements of ignorance within the wisdom of observation, thus unlike the eight worldly dhyānas which are mixed with ignorance.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c04_1']	「聰慧人」下即依止甚微。	「聰慧人」下即依止甚微。	033	Wise people and below immediately rely on the extremely subtle.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c05_4']	聰慧人者，登地已上有智之者，彼人之智能行地智。	聰慧人者，登地已上有智之者，彼人之智能行地智。	033	Wise people refer to those with wisdom who have ascended to the grounds. Their wisdom can practice the wisdom of the grounds.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c05_9']	何智能行？	何智能行？	033	What wisdom can practice?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c06_5']	若就總就實，唯一實智，見一實諦故。	若就總就實，唯一實智，見一實諦故。	033	If based on the general and the real, there is only one real wisdom, because they see the one real truth.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c06_15']	若就別兼權則通三智：	若就別兼權則通三智：	033	If based on the specific and also the provisional, it generally includes three wisdoms:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c07_9']	一加行智，增上善勝解故；	一加行智，增上善勝解故；	033	First, the wisdom of added effort, because of the superior good understanding;
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c08_10']	二根本智，增上善寂滅故，謂滅諸惑證寂理故；	二根本智，增上善寂滅故，謂滅諸惑證寂理故；	033	Second, the fundamental wisdom, because of the superior good quiescence, that is, because of extinguishing afflictions and realizing the principle of quiescence;
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c09_2']	三後得智，隨聞明了故。	三後得智，隨聞明了故。	033	Third, the subsequent wisdom, because of the clear understanding according to what is heard.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c09_7']	云何行處？	云何行處？	033	What is the place of practice?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c10_1']	此之地智是彼證智，自證知故。	此之地智是彼證智，自證知故。	033	This wisdom of the grounds is the wisdom they realize, because they realize it themselves.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c11_6']	依彼地智說證智生故說為行，非正證時有能所行也。	依彼地智說證智生故說為行，非正證時有能所行也。	033	Based on that ground wisdom, it is said that the wisdom of realization arises, so it is said to be practiced. It is not that at the time of true realization there is an agent and an object of practice.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c12_11']	上四微中功德異小，觀行異凡，依止清淨揀異外道。	上四微中功德異小，觀行異凡，依止清淨揀異外道。	033	Among the four subtle merits above, the practice is different from the small, and the contemplation is different from the ordinary. Relying on the pure grounds distinguishes it from the non-Buddhists.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c13_3']	自尊之者，以智斷異故。	自尊之者，以智斷異故。	033	Those who revere themselves are different in terms of wisdom and cessation.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c14_9']	前清淨微是斷德，不同彼有見惑及滅心想，為清淨故。	前清淨微是斷德，不同彼有見惑及滅心想，為清淨故。	033	The previous purity and subtlety are the virtue of cessation, unlike that which has the seen afflictions and the thought of cessation, for the sake of purity.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c15_8']	依止即是智德，不同彼以六行而伏惑故。	依止即是智德，不同彼以六行而伏惑故。	033	The basis is precisely the virtue of wisdom, unlike that which subdues afflictions through the six practices.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c16_4']	上依增勝，若通說者並異凡小。	上依增勝，若通說者並異凡小。	033	The above relies on the superior, if speaking generally, both are different from ordinary and small.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c16_13']	第二兩頌別顯微相。	第二兩頌別顯微相。	033	The second two verses specifically reveal the subtle characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c17_7']	故論云「此甚微智復有何相？	故論云「此甚微智復有何相？	033	Therefore, the treatise says: This extremely subtle wisdom has what characteristics?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c17_14']	」此徵體相也。	」此徵體相也。	033	This investigates the essence and characteristics.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c18_1']	是智有二相：	是智有二相：	033	This wisdom has two characteristics:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c18_14']	初二句明同相，智體空寂故；	初二句明同相，智體空寂故；	033	The first two lines clarify the common characteristic, because the essence of wisdom is empty and tranquil;
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c19_7']	後六句不同相，智位差別故。	後六句不同相，智位差別故。	033	The latter six lines are the uncommon characteristics, because the stages of wisdom are differentiated.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c19_21']	今初，同中，上句總、下句別。	今初，同中，上句總、下句別。	033	Now, first, in the common, the upper line is general, and the lower line is specific.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c20_7']	總中，此是誰相？	總中，此是誰相？	033	In the general, whose characteristics are these?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c20_17']	彼智相故，故言自體。	彼智相故，故言自體。	033	Because they are the characteristics of that wisdom, therefore it is said to be its own essence.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c21_5']	此智自體以何為相？	此智自體以何為相？	033	What are the characteristics of this wisdom's own essence?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c21_10']	謂本空寂。	謂本空寂。	033	Namely, originally empty and tranquil.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c21_15']	何以言同？	何以言同？	033	Why is it said to be common?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c22_8']	此即性淨涅槃，上同諸佛；	此即性淨涅槃，上同諸佛；	033	This is precisely the pure nirvana, above the same as all Buddhas;
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c23_3']	下同眾生，一切眾生皆有此故。	下同眾生，一切眾生皆有此故。	033	Below, it is the same as sentient beings, because all sentient beings have this.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c23_13']	橫同諸法，諸法如故。	橫同諸法，諸法如故。	033	Horizontally, it is the same as all dharmas, because the suchness of all dharmas is the same.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c24_12']	此如即是自體空故，一切皆以空為自性。	此如即是自體空故，一切皆以空為自性。	033	This suchness is precisely the emptiness of self-nature, therefore all have emptiness as their intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c25_12']	智性色性本無差故，一切皆有安樂性故。	智性色性本無差故，一切皆有安樂性故。	033	The nature of cognition and the nature of form are originally without difference, therefore all have the nature of bliss.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c26_12']	下句別者，論經加一有字，云有不二不盡。	下句別者，論經加一有字，云有不二不盡。	033	The last phrase is different. The treatise adds the word existence in the sūtra, saying existence, non-duality, and inexhaustibility.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c26_15']	釋云：	釋云：	033	The commentary says:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c27_6']	此智空寂，其相云何？	此智空寂，其相云何？	033	What are the characteristics of this cognition that is empty and tranquil?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c27_18']	謂離三種空攝，是真空相。	謂離三種空攝，是真空相。	033	It is said to be free from the three kinds of emptiness, which are the characteristics of true emptiness.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0751c29_16']	三種空者，即地前空亂意菩薩，一疑空滅色，取斷滅空，此失空如來藏，則損減也；	三種空者，即地前空亂意菩薩，一疑空滅色，取斷滅空，此失空如來藏，則損減也；	033	The three kinds of emptiness are: First, bodhisattvas before the grounds who are confused about emptiness doubt that emptiness destroys form and grasp emptiness as annihilation, losing the emptiness of the tathāgatagarbha, which is a loss;
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a01_8']	二疑空異色，取色外空；	二疑空異色，取色外空；	033	Second, they doubt that emptiness is different from form and grasp emptiness as external to form;
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a01_19']	三疑空是物，取空為有。	三疑空是物，取空為有。	033	Third, they doubt that emptiness is an entity and grasp emptiness as existent.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a03_1']	今云有者，即初離謗攝，不謂斷滅如兔角故。	今云有者，即初離謗攝，不謂斷滅如兔角故。	033	Now, the word existence means being free from the first kind of slander and not referring to annihilation like the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a04_4']	言不二者，即離異攝，不謂異此空智更有異空。	言不二者，即離異攝，不謂異此空智更有異空。	033	As for non-dual, it means free from the inclusion of difference, not that apart from this empty wisdom there is another kind of emptiness.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a05_9']	言不盡者，離盡滅攝，不謂有彼此自體，彼此轉滅故。	言不盡者，離盡滅攝，不謂有彼此自體，彼此轉滅故。	033	As for inexhaustible, it means free from the inclusion of exhaustion and cessation, not that there is a self-nature here and there that transforms and ceases.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a06_15']	此明非滅有體之智成有體之空，亦非空有物可轉滅也。	此明非滅有體之智成有體之空，亦非空有物可轉滅也。	033	This clarifies that the wisdom of non-extinction of an existent nature forms an existent nature of emptiness, and it is also not that there is an existent thing that can transform and cease.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a07_13']	離此三空，即見自性本空空如來藏。	離此三空，即見自性本空空如來藏。	033	Being free from these three kinds of emptiness, one then sees the originally empty nature of suchness, which is the empty tathāgatagarbha.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a08_4']	今闕有字，如何會通？	今闕有字，如何會通？	033	Now, the character existence is missing. How can it be understood?
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a08_9']	此有二意：	此有二意：	033	There are two meanings to this:
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a09_11']	一以不盡攝之，謂有體故不盡，無則異於斷滅。	一以不盡攝之，謂有體故不盡，無則異於斷滅。	033	First, it is included in inexhaustible, meaning that because it has an existent nature it is inexhaustible, and without it would be different from annihilation.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a10_8']	若無可盡滅則非有物，義如前說。	若無可盡滅則非有物，義如前說。	033	If there is nothing that can be exhausted or ceased, then it is not an existent thing. The meaning is as explained above.
['ZH_T35_1735_033:0752a12_4']	二者西域之經自有二本，故論云「有二種頌，一有不二不盡，二定不二不盡。	二者西域之經自有二本，故論云「有二種頌，一有不二不盡，二定不二不盡。	033	Second, the sūtras of the Western Regions themselves have two versions.
