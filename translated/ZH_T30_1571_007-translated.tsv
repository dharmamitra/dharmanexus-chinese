['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222a23_8']	根是了別境界所依，將欲破根先除其境，境既除已根亦隨亡。	根是了別境界所依，將欲破根先除其境，境既除已根亦隨亡。	The senses are the basis for distinguishing objects. Before refuting the senses, one should first eliminate their objects. Once the objects are eliminated, the senses will also disappear.

['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222a24_12']	瓶衣等物唯色等成，諸根所行體是實有。	瓶衣等物唯色等成，諸根所行體是實有。	Things like pots and clothes are only composed of form, etc., and the substance of what the senses perceive truly exists.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222a25_2']	為破此計，故說頌曰：	為破此計，故說頌曰：	In order to refute this view, a verse is spoken:
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222a26_14']	「於瓶諸分中，　　可見唯是色；	「於瓶諸分中，　　可見唯是色；	Among the parts of a pot, only form can be seen;

['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222a28_2']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise states:🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222a29_20']	汝宗自說眼等諸根各取自境不相雜亂，眼唯見色、瓶通四塵，豈見色時全見瓶體？	汝宗自說眼等諸根各取自境不相雜亂，眼唯見色、瓶通四塵，豈見色時全見瓶體？	Your school itself says that the various faculties such as the eyes each take their own objects and do not mix up with each other. The eyes only see form, while a vase has four elements. How can it be that when one sees form one completely sees the substance of the vase?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b01_18']	此顯瓶體非眼所見，非唯色故，猶如聲等。	此顯瓶體非眼所見，非唯色故，猶如聲等。	This shows that the substance of the vase is not seen by the eyes, because it is not only form, just like sound and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b02_7']	豈不瓶體亦是色耶？	豈不瓶體亦是色耶？	Isn't the substance of the vase also form?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b03_15']	我不言瓶體唯非色，但言瓶體非唯色成，故所立因無不成失。	我不言瓶體唯非色，但言瓶體非唯色成，故所立因無不成失。	I do not say that the substance of the vase is only not form, but only that the substance of the vase is not only form, so the reason you give is not fallacious.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b04_15']	汝於現事既有乖違，而言悟真，此何可信？	汝於現事既有乖違，而言悟真，此何可信？	Since you are already in disagreement with what is right before your eyes, how can we believe what you say about realizing the truth?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b05_9']	如眼所見唯色非瓶，香等亦然。	如眼所見唯色非瓶，香等亦然。	Just as the eyes only see form and not the vase, so it is with smell and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b05_14']	故次頌曰：	故次頌曰：	Therefore the next verse says:

['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b09_10']	鼻舌身根其境各異，全取瓶體義亦不成，瓶非三根所取境界。	鼻舌身根其境各異，全取瓶體義亦不成，瓶非三根所取境界。	The objects of the faculties of nose, tongue, and body are each different. The meaning of completely taking the substance of the vase is also not established, because the vase is not the object taken by the three faculties.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b10_17']	一一比量如前應知，聲既非恒故此不說，類其色等聲亦應然。	一一比量如前應知，聲既非恒故此不說，類其色等聲亦應然。	Each inference should be understood as before. Since sound is not eternal, it is not mentioned here. Sound should be the same as form and so forth.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b12_10']	如是一切瓶衣車等，皆非色根所取境界，非定意識取於外境必隨色根。	如是一切瓶衣車等，皆非色根所取境界，非定意識取於外境必隨色根。	In this way, all pots, clothes, carts, and so forth are not objects perceived by the sense faculties. The determinate mental consciousness does not necessarily perceive external objects, but must follow the sense faculties.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b13_6']	瓶等既非色根境界，意亦應爾。	瓶等既非色根境界，意亦應爾。	Since pots and so forth are not objects of the sense faculties, the mind should also be the same.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b14_5']	若不爾者，盲聾等人亦應了別色等外境。	若不爾者，盲聾等人亦應了別色等外境。	If it were not so, then even blind and deaf people would be able to perceive external objects such as form.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b15_4']	如是瓶等非根所行，皆是自心分別所起。	如是瓶等非根所行，皆是自心分別所起。	In this way, pots and so forth are not within the scope of the sense faculties, but are all arisen from the mind's own discrimination.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b17_6']	若言瓶等與色等法體無異故，眼等諸根如取自境亦取瓶等，是故諸根亦能漸次取瓶等境。	若言瓶等與色等法體無異故，眼等諸根如取自境亦取瓶等，是故諸根亦能漸次取瓶等境。	If it is said that because pots and so forth are not different in substance from form and so forth, the sense faculties such as the eyes also perceive pots and so forth just as they perceive their own objects, therefore the sense faculties can also gradually perceive objects such as pots.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b18_19']	若爾瓶等應是一切色根所行，即違諸根各取自境，或一瓶等體應成多。	若爾瓶等應是一切色根所行，即違諸根各取自境，或一瓶等體應成多。	If that were so, then pots and so forth would be within the scope of all the sense faculties, contradicting the fact that each sense faculty perceives its own objects, or the substance of a single pot would become multiple.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b19_17']	或許諸根不取瓶等，唯色等體是根境故。	或許諸根不取瓶等，唯色等體是根境故。	Perhaps the various faculties do not apprehend vases, etc., because only form, etc., are the substance of the faculties and objects.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b20_16']	色等各別既非是瓶，如何合時成實瓶體？	色等各別既非是瓶，如何合時成實瓶體？	Since form, etc., individually are not vases, how, when combined, do they form the real substance of a vase?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b22_5']	若言瓶等眾分合成，見一分時言見瓶等，如見城分亦名見城。	若言瓶等眾分合成，見一分時言見瓶等，如見城分亦名見城。	If it is said that vases, etc., are formed by the combination of many parts, and when one part is seen it is said that one sees the vase, etc., just as when one sees a part of a city it is also called seeing the city,
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b23_13']	此亦不然，城非實故，城體是假，眾分合成，見一分時不名全見。	此亦不然，城非實故，城體是假，眾分合成，見一分時不名全見。	this is also not so, because a city is not real. The substance of a city is a conceptual fiction formed by the combination of many parts. When one part is seen, it is not called seeing the whole.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b24_12']	瓶等若爾是假非真，汝等云何執實可見？	瓶等若爾是假非真，汝等云何執實可見？	If vases, etc., are like this, they are conceptual fictions, not real. How can you insist that they are real and can be seen?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b25_12']	又見一分言可見者，其理不然，故次頌曰：	又見一分言可見者，其理不然，故次頌曰：	Moreover, as for saying that when one part is seen it can be seen, this principle is not so. Therefore the next verse says:
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b26_14']	「若唯見瓶色，　　即言見瓶者；	「若唯見瓶色，　　即言見瓶者；	If one only sees the color of a vase and says one sees the vase,
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b27_13']	既不見香等，　　應名不見瓶。	既不見香等，　　應名不見瓶。	since one does not see smell, etc., one should be called not seeing the vase.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222b28_2']	」論曰：	」論曰：	The treatise states:
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c02_18']	若和合中有眾多分，由一分故全得其名，謂於一瓶有色等分，由見色故言見瓶者，所餘香等既不可見，應從多分言不見瓶，亦不應言色體是勝，瓶一分故，猶如香等。	若和合中有眾多分，由一分故全得其名，謂於一瓶有色等分，由見色故言見瓶者，所餘香等既不可見，應從多分言不見瓶，亦不應言色體是勝，瓶一分故，猶如香等。	If a composite whole is said to be perceived by a part of it, then a pot should be said to be seen when its color is seen, since color is a part of the pot. The other parts such as smell, etc., are not seen, so it should be said that the pot is not seen, since the majority of its parts are not seen. It should not be said that color is the most important part of the pot, since it is only a part of the pot, just like smell, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c03_16']	色等於瓶既無勝劣，應從香等名不可見。	色等於瓶既無勝劣，應從香等名不可見。	Since color, etc., are neither the most important nor the least important parts of the pot, the pot should be said to be invisible, since it is a part of smell, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c05_14']	世間立名，或從多分、或就最勝，色上全無、香等有一，是故瓶等應從香等名不可見。	世間立名，或從多分、或就最勝，色上全無、香等有一，是故瓶等應從香等名不可見。	The world gives names to things either according to the majority of their parts or according to their most important part. Color is totally absent in smell, etc., but smell, etc., are present in color. Therefore, pots, etc., should be said to be invisible, since they are a part of smell, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c07_8']	是則外色亦應非實，是可見性，是瓶衣等不可見法一分攝故，猶如香等。	是則外色亦應非實，是可見性，是瓶衣等不可見法一分攝故，猶如香等。	Then external color should also not be real, since it is a visible nature that is a part of the invisible pot, clothing, etc., just like smell, etc.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c08_6']	世間共知瓶色可見，云何得立不可見耶？	世間共知瓶色可見，云何得立不可見耶？	How can it be said that the color of a pot is invisible, since the world commonly knows that the color of a pot is visible?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c10_9']	世間所知隨自心變，假說可見非外實色，今遮心外實有可見，故不相違不可見法，無所有故。	世間所知隨自心變，假說可見非外實色，今遮心外實有可見，故不相違不可見法，無所有故。	The visible forms that are known in the world are said to be visible only because they are transformations of one's own mind. They are not external real forms. Now, in order to refute the existence of real forms outside the mind, it is said that they are not visible. This does not contradict the fact that invisible dharmas do not exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c10_14']	應不可說。	應不可說。	It should not be said.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c10_19']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c11_16']	可見無故名不可見，無法都無如何可說？	可見無故名不可見，無法都無如何可說？	Because the visible does not exist, it is called invisible. How can something that is completely nonexistent be spoken of?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c12_10']	可見之法以有體故可為他說。	可見之法以有體故可為他說。	Visible dharmas, because they have substance, can be spoken of for others.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c12_15']	此亦不然。	此亦不然。	This is also not so.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c13_19']	無體之法亦是說因，若不爾者，不可見言現應無有。	無體之法亦是說因，若不爾者，不可見言現應無有。	Dharmas without substance are also the cause of speech. If it were not so, the word invisible would not exist.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c14_17']	又見於色都無所益，何故說色以為可見？	又見於色都無所益，何故說色以為可見？	Moreover, seeing form does not benefit at all. Why is form said to be visible?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c15_3']	非不可見。	非不可見。	It is not invisible.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c15_8']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c17_1']	非由能見及不能見令色有異，云何由見說色可見，非由不見說不可見？	非由能見及不能見令色有異，云何由見說色可見，非由不見說不可見？	It is not because of the ability to see or the inability to see that form has differences. How can it be said that form is visible because of seeing, and not said to be invisible because of not seeing?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c18_18']	如瓶上色是可見故說瓶可見，瓶上香等不可見故，亦應說瓶為不可見，其理等故。	如瓶上色是可見故說瓶可見，瓶上香等不可見故，亦應說瓶為不可見，其理等故。	Just as the color on the top of a pot is visible, so the pot is said to be visible. The fragrance, etc., on the pot are not visible, so the pot should also be said to be invisible, because the reasoning is the same.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c20_7']	又眼見時說色可見，眼不見時亦應說色為不可見，其理等故。	又眼見時說色可見，眼不見時亦應說色為不可見，其理等故。	Moreover, when the eye sees, it is said that form is visible. When the eye does not see, it should also be said that form is invisible, because the reasoning is the same.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c21_14']	瓶之與色既有可見不可見義，何故今者偏破可見立不可見？	瓶之與色既有可見不可見義，何故今者偏破可見立不可見？	Since the pot and form both have the meaning of being visible and invisible, why is it now only refuted that they are visible and established that they are invisible?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c22_17']	可見起執，遮可見故言不可見，非立瓶色為不可見。	可見起執，遮可見故言不可見，非立瓶色為不可見。	Because the attachment to visibility is stopped, it is said to be invisible, not establishing the pot or form as invisible.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c23_16']	又色亦非全體可見，如何由色而說見瓶？	又色亦非全體可見，如何由色而說見瓶？	Moreover, form is also not entirely visible. How can the seeing of the pot be due to form?

['ZH_T30_1571_007:0222c29_10']	所有諸色，雖見一分而不見餘，故應如瓶名不可見。	所有諸色，雖見一分而不見餘，故應如瓶名不可見。	Although one sees a part of all forms, one does not see the rest, and therefore they should be called invisible like a pot.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a01_13']	於諸分中此分非勝，餘分為多，此應從多名不可見。	於諸分中此分非勝，餘分為多，此應從多名不可見。	Among the parts, this part is not superior, and the other parts are more numerous. It should be called invisible according to the majority.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a03_7']	麁色漸析未至極微常有多分，若至極微非色根境，是故諸色皆不可見。	麁色漸析未至極微常有多分，若至極微非色根境，是故諸色皆不可見。	Coarse form gradually becomes smaller until it reaches the ultimate atom. It is always composed of many parts. If it reaches the ultimate atom, it is not the object of the material faculties. Therefore all forms are invisible.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a04_11']	豈不極微外面傍布無所障隔，相隣而住全可見耶？	豈不極微外面傍布無所障隔，相隣而住全可見耶？	Isn't it the case that the outer surface of the ultimate atom is spread out without obstruction, and it abides side by side with others, all visible?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a06_14']	眾微總相是假非實，一一別相非色根境，有礙極微面有彼此，如何得立色法實有全體可見？	眾微總相是假非實，一一別相非色根境，有礙極微面有彼此，如何得立色法實有全體可見？	The general characteristics of many atoms are provisional and not real. The specific characteristics of each individual atom are not the objects of the material faculties. The surface of an obstructed ultimate atom has this and that. How can it be established that the substance of form really exists and is entirely visible?
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a07_13']	雖諸極微總相是假，一一別住實不可見。	雖諸極微總相是假，一一別住實不可見。	Although the general characteristics of all ultimate atoms are provisional, each individual atom abiding separately really cannot be seen.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a09_7']	然諸極微和合相助不可分析，面有彼此，故一一微其體實有，全分可見。	然諸極微和合相助不可分析，面有彼此，故一一微其體實有，全分可見。	However, the extremely subtle particles combine and assist each other, and cannot be analyzed. The front and back sides have each other, therefore each subtle particle has a real substance, and can be seen in its entirety.

In the chapter on refuting permanence, it has already been explained that the subtle particle has parts and is not real.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a14_13']	極微一一既不可見，云何和合相助可見？	極微一一既不可見，云何和合相助可見？	Since each subtle particle cannot be seen, how can the combination and assistance be seen?

Therefore, it cannot be used as evidence to prove that all form is real and can be seen.
['ZH_T30_1571_007:0223a21_1']	如色由前所說道理，有分無實非色根境，如是一切有質礙法，皆眾分成非色根境。	如色由前所說道理，有分無實非色根境，如是一切有質礙法，皆眾分成非色根境。	Just as form, due to the previously explained principles, has parts and is not real and is not the object of the form sense faculty, in the same way, all phenomena with resistance are composed of many and are not the objects of the form sense faculty.
