['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c05_10']	答：	答：	The answer is:
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c09_12']	彼旃延章，總有五句，初之四句名藏義通，後之一句名通四教，義局衍門，結歸之文既通圓別，故前四句現結成通不關圓別，彼之一句雖結成通仍通圓別，今從通義故得成圓。	彼旃延章，總有五句，初之四句名藏義通，後之一句名通四教，義局衍門，結歸之文既通圓別，故前四句現結成通不關圓別，彼之一句雖結成通仍通圓別，今從通義故得成圓。	In the chapter on Chandayana, there are five sentences in total. The first four sentences are called the meaning of the canon is通(penetrating), and the last one is called 通(penetrating) the four teachings, with the meaning limited to the advanced teachings. The text of the conclusion is both 通(penetrating) and distinct, so the first four sentences are concluded as 通(penetrating) and not related to the distinct and perfect teachings. Although the last sentence concludes as 通(penetrating), it is still 通(penetrating) and distinct. Now following the meaning of 通(penetrating), it can be made perfect.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c10_9']	若得此意諸句可明，故略引之。	若得此意諸句可明，故略引之。	If one understands this meaning, the various sentences can be clarified. Therefore, it is briefly quoted.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c11_4']	「法本不生故無可滅」，是寂滅義。	「法本不生故無可滅」，是寂滅義。	The Dharma is originally unborn, so there is nothing to be extinguished, is the meaning of quiescent extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c13_6']	云「唱滅」者，此唱寂滅，是滅生之滅非即生之滅，即生之滅是不滅故，當知此滅名為不滅。	云「唱滅」者，此唱寂滅，是滅生之滅非即生之滅，即生之滅是不滅故，當知此滅名為不滅。	As for announcing extinction, this is announcing quiescent extinction, which is the extinction of birth and not the extinction of birth itself. The extinction of birth itself is non-extinction, so one should know that this extinction is called non-extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c14_6']	法身常住無滅不滅，今言寂滅義當唱滅。	法身常住無滅不滅，今言寂滅義當唱滅。	The Dharma body is eternally abiding, without extinction or non-extinction. Now, speaking of quiescent extinction corresponds to announcing extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c15_14']	「何者」下釋唱滅意，為不了者而云寂滅，若了寂滅還指於生。	「何者」下釋唱滅意，為不了者而云寂滅，若了寂滅還指於生。	What is it? below explains the meaning of announcing extinction. For those who do not understand, it is said to be quiescent extinction. If one understands quiescent extinction, it still points to birth.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c16_14']	若全指於生，於懈怠者無利，故須唱滅。	若全指於生，於懈怠者無利，故須唱滅。	If one completely points to the arising, there is no benefit for the lazy, so extinction must be proclaimed.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c19_8']	然彼經中以照寂為等覺，以寂照為妙覺，彼約別教教道以說，故分二句以對二位。	然彼經中以照寂為等覺，以寂照為妙覺，彼約別教教道以說，故分二句以對二位。	However, in that sutra, illuminating quiescence is considered to be equal enlightenment, and quiescent illumination is considered to be wondrous enlightenment. It is explained based on the teaching path of the separate teaching, so two phrases are divided to correspond to the two stages.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c20_12']	今借別教極果之名，以通初後而釋圓教不滅而滅。	今借別教極果之名，以通初後而釋圓教不滅而滅。	Now, borrowing the name of the ultimate fruit of the separate teaching, it is used to explain the perfect teaching of non-extinction and extinction from beginning to end.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c21_6']	四「夫法身」下，釋唱滅義。	四「夫法身」下，釋唱滅義。	Fourth, below the Dharma body, it explains the meaning of proclaiming extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c22_5']	由唱滅故智生惑滅，此約事理相對論也。	由唱滅故智生惑滅，此約事理相對論也。	Due to the proclamation of extinction, wisdom arises and delusions are extinguished. This is discussed in terms of the correspondence between phenomena and principle.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c23_7']	「若迷心」等者，一往觀語似同報身，其意則別。	「若迷心」等者，一往觀語似同報身，其意則別。	If one is confused about the mind and so on, the words seem the same as the reward body when viewed from one perspective, but the meaning is different.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c25_1']	此中正明所滅之惑為法身體，體有生滅良由於智，故寄能顯以彰所顯。	此中正明所滅之惑為法身體，體有生滅良由於智，故寄能顯以彰所顯。	Here, it is correctly explained that the delusions to be extinguished are the essence of the Dharma body. The essence has arising and ceasing due to wisdom, so it is entrusted to the able to manifest to show the manifested.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c25_13']	五「滅惑」下，次判圓別。	五「滅惑」下，次判圓別。	Fifth, below extinguishing delusions, it next distinguishes the perfect and separate.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c27_10']	別教尚屬無常之滅，以十住中同於小乘，滅三界惑方生出假俗智之解，入中亦然。	別教尚屬無常之滅，以十住中同於小乘，滅三界惑方生出假俗智之解，入中亦然。	The Distinct Teaching is still subject to the cessation of impermanence, because in the Ten Abodes it is the same as the Lesser Vehicle, extinguishing the delusions of the Three Realms and only then giving rise to the understanding of the conventional wisdom of leaving behind [the world of] appearances. Entering the Middle is also like this.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c28_1']	今約圓教故唱寂滅。	今約圓教故唱寂滅。	Now, because it is about the Perfect Teaching, it proclaims cessation and extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c29_6']	「此之」等者，雖別圓不同並名生滅，雖俱生滅悉約理性。	「此之」等者，雖別圓不同並名生滅，雖俱生滅悉約理性。	This and so on means that although the Distinct and Perfect are different, they are both called arising and ceasing. Although they are both arising and ceasing, they are all about the principle of reality.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0337c29_20']	六「若無」等者，明唱滅之緣。	六「若無」等者，明唱滅之緣。	Sixth, If there were no and so on clarifies the conditions for proclaiming cessation.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a02_13']	從迷從解故云「迷解」，剋論但以解為唱緣，別圓俱是從迷生解故也。	從迷從解故云「迷解」，剋論但以解為唱緣，別圓俱是從迷生解故也。	Following delusion and following understanding is called delusion and understanding. In terms of the actual, it is only using understanding as the condition for proclaiming [cessation]. Both the Distinct and Perfect are about giving rise to understanding from delusion.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a06_6']	三「此總」下結報身體，明即是智、暗即無明，體性全是故無相除，既無相除即不滅也。	三「此總」下結報身體，明即是智、暗即無明，體性全是故無相除，既無相除即不滅也。	Third, below this is the general is the conclusion of the retribution body, clarifying that it is precisely wisdom, and darkness is precisely ignorance. Since the essence is entirely so, there is no elimination of characteristics. Since there is no elimination of characteristics, it is not extinguished.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a12_1']	次「又法身」下明三身不滅中，初法身不滅中言「當體」者，不望餘身，以餘二身須望法耳。	次「又法身」下明三身不滅中，初法身不滅中言「當體」者，不望餘身，以餘二身須望法耳。	Next, below Furthermore, the Dharma body is clarifying the non-extinction of the three bodies. In the initial non-extinction of the Dharma body, it says the essence refers to not looking at the other bodies, because the other two bodies must be based on the Dharma.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a12_12']	若將體望用，用却成滅。	若將體望用，用却成滅。	If one takes the essence to look at the function, the function then becomes extinguished.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a13_3']	次約報身不滅者為二：	次約報身不滅者為二：	Next, in the non-extinction of the retribution body, there are two parts:

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a14_7']	不滅即是報稱於法，法既不滅報亦不滅。	不滅即是報稱於法，法既不滅報亦不滅。	Non-extinction is the retribution corresponding to the Dharma. Since the Dharma is non-extinguishing, the retribution is also non-extinguishing.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a16_7']	次「以理」下約事理相對以釋，先約理無滅，次「就有」下約事有滅，從約理邊即是不滅。	次「以理」下約事理相對以釋，先約理無滅，次「就有」下約事有滅，從約理邊即是不滅。	Next, below using principle, it is explained by contrasting principle and phenomena. First, it is about the non-extinction of principle. Next, below in terms of existence, it is about the extinction of phenomena. From the side of principle, it is precisely non-extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a18_6']	初約理中云「為到故」等者，於其惑智四句檢責，還約體檢，惑尚不滅、智體無破。	初約理中云「為到故」等者，於其惑智四句檢責，還約體檢，惑尚不滅、智體無破。	In the beginning, in terms of principle, it says in order to reach and so on. It examines the four statements of delusion and wisdom, and again examines the essence. Delusion is not extinguished, and the essence of wisdom is not destroyed.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a20_18']	若言智慧能破煩惱，為到故破？	若言智慧能破煩惱，為到故破？	If it is said that wisdom can destroy afflictions, is it destroyed by reaching?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a21_5']	為不到能破？	為不到能破？	Or is it destroyed without reaching?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a21_15']	若到故破，凡夫能破。	若到故破，凡夫能破。	If it is destroyed by reaching, ordinary people can destroy it.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a22_6']	若不到破，初念應破。	若不到破，初念應破。	If it is destroyed without reaching, the first thought should destroy it.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a22_17']	若初念不破，後亦不破。	若初念不破，後亦不破。	If the first thought is not destroyed, the later is also not destroyed.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a23_9']	若到不到破者，是義不然。	若到不到破者，是義不然。	If it is said that reaching or not reaching destroys, this is not reasonable.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a24_4']	如是推求，誰有智慧能破煩惱？	如是推求，誰有智慧能破煩惱？	Thus, who has wisdom that can destroy afflictions?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a24_14']	言「共獨」者，佛言：	言「共獨」者，佛言：	As for together or alone, the Buddha said:
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a25_11']	如一盲人不能見色，雖伴眾盲亦不能見。	如一盲人不能見色，雖伴眾盲亦不能見。	Just as one blind person cannot see forms, even a group of blind people cannot see.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a26_3']	慧定共別準說可知。	慧定共別準說可知。	The distinction between wisdom and concentration can be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a26_12']	此即報智不能滅惑。	此即報智不能滅惑。	This means that the wisdom of retribution cannot destroy afflictions.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338a28_2']	次「就有智慧」等者，復更約事而定判之，智能滅惑智不名滅。	次「就有智慧」等者，復更約事而定判之，智能滅惑智不名滅。	Next, as for those with wisdom, etc., further determines it based on events, and the ability to destroy afflictions is not called destruction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b01_6']	三約應身明不滅者，亦望法報，報約於法故前法身但云「當體」，今此應身利物不斷亦是不滅。	三約應身明不滅者，亦望法報，報約於法故前法身但云「當體」，今此應身利物不斷亦是不滅。	Third, clarifying non-destruction in terms of the responsive body, also in terms of the Dharma-body and retribution-body. The retribution-body is based on the Dharma-body, so the previous Dharma-body only speaks of the essence. Now, this responsive body benefits beings without interruption, which is also non-destruction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b02_5']	故云「常然應用不絕」者，三身相稱故也。	故云「常然應用不絕」者，三身相稱故也。	Therefore, it says the application of the three bodies is always uninterrupted, because the three bodies are commensurate.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b03_18']	法報遍故應體亦遍，機自在無應法恒爾，若不爾者，雖釋圓常還同生滅。	法報遍故應體亦遍，機自在無應法恒爾，若不爾者，雖釋圓常還同生滅。	Because the Dharma and reward bodies are all-pervading, the responding body is also all-pervading. When the capacities of sentient beings are free, the responding Dharma is always so. If it were not so, even if one explains the perfect and eternal, it would still be the same as arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b05_6']	言「眾生不盡即不滅度」者，滅度之時生實未盡，其義何耶？	言「眾生不盡即不滅度」者，滅度之時生實未盡，其義何耶？	As for the statement sentient beings are not exhausted, so I do not attain nirvana, when attaining nirvana, sentient beings are actually not exhausted. What is the meaning of this?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b05_11']	應反質云：	應反質云：	One should counter-question:
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b07_2']	驗生未盡則不滅度，故唱滅度為不生於難遭想者，非為生盡。	驗生未盡則不滅度，故唱滅度為不生於難遭想者，非為生盡。	Examining that sentient beings are not exhausted, one does not attain nirvana. Therefore, proclaiming the attainment of nirvana is to prevent the arising of the thought of difficulty in encountering [the Buddha], not because sentient beings are exhausted.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b07_16']	故知應身常在不滅，何獨法耶？	故知應身常在不滅，何獨法耶？	Therefore, one should know that the responding body always abides without extinction. How can it be unique to the Dharma?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b08_10']	若不了者法報亦滅，何獨應耶？	若不了者法報亦滅，何獨應耶？	If one does not understand this, the Dharma and reward bodies also perish. How can it be unique to the response?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b09_10']	三明三身不生不滅者，法身同前不當生滅。	三明三身不生不滅者，法身同前不當生滅。	Third, clarifying that the three bodies are non-arising and non-ceasing means that the Dharma body is the same as before and should not be subject to arising and ceasing.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b11_4']	報身者，智自了智無能滅者，智屬於能既不生滅，豈能令惑若生若滅。	報身者，智自了智無能滅者，智屬於能既不生滅，豈能令惑若生若滅。	As for the reward body, the wisdom that understands itself cannot be extinguished. Since the wisdom belongs to the able one and is not subject to arising and ceasing, how can it cause afflictions to arise or cease?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b11_20']	應身者，相續故不生、相續故不滅。	應身者，相續故不生、相續故不滅。	As for the responding body, it does not arise because it continues, and it does not cease because it continues.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b13_16']	三身但云「不生滅」者，「不」字貫下「滅」字，即不生不滅，逐語便故但云「不生滅」耳。	三身但云「不生滅」者，「不」字貫下「滅」字，即不生不滅，逐語便故但云「不生滅」耳。	As for the three bodies, it only says non-arising and non-ceasing. The character non extends to the following ceasing, which is non-arising and non-ceasing. It only says non-arising and non-ceasing for the sake of convenience in expression.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b14_13']	「云云」者，釋出三身不生滅意，以互融故。	「云云」者，釋出三身不生滅意，以互融故。	And so on explains the meaning of the non-arising and non-ceasing of the three bodies, because they mutually subsume each other.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b17_3']	此因應身非滅唱滅一句之文，廣開三身有滅、不滅、不生不滅，若不爾者，生滅則定，何名三身不即不離？	此因應身非滅唱滅一句之文，廣開三身有滅、不滅、不生不滅，若不爾者，生滅則定，何名三身不即不離？	This passage, The reason for the response body is not ceasing but proclaiming ceasing, extensively explains that the three bodies have ceasing, non-ceasing, and neither arising nor ceasing. If it were not so, arising and ceasing would be fixed. How could it be said that the three bodies are neither identical nor separate?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0338b21_8']	若得此意，遍一代教但聞一句唱滅之言，即識一切滅不滅義，具身多少滅不滅異，方達本地本不生滅，方達中間今日化道有滅不滅，以本地化中間今日一切迹教，不出三身四句故也。	若得此意，遍一代教但聞一句唱滅之言，即識一切滅不滅義，具身多少滅不滅異，方達本地本不生滅，方達中間今日化道有滅不滅，以本地化中間今日一切迹教，不出三身四句故也。	If one understands this meaning, then hearing just one statement of ceasing in the entire teaching, one will recognize the meaning of all ceasing and non-ceasing. One will be fully aware of the differences in the number of bodies and the distinctions in ceasing and non-ceasing, and only then will one understand the original ground of neither arising nor ceasing, and only then will one understand the ceasing and non-ceasing of the transformative path in the present. This is because the original ground, the present, and the transformative teachings of the present are not beyond the four statements of the three bodies.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c09_19']	《論》以地前為損生，則無增道。	《論》以地前為損生，則無增道。	The treatise takes the stages before the grounds as diminishing birth, then there is no increasing of the path.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c10_14']	光宅以七地已上為損生，安得無增道？	光宅以七地已上為損生，安得無增道？	Guangzhai takes the seventh ground and above as diminishing birth, how can there be no increasing of the path?

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c13_13']	從「但約」下即是今意，但約智斷相對以明增損。	從「但約」下即是今意，但約智斷相對以明增損。	From but only below is the present meaning, but only in terms of wisdom and elimination to clarify increase and decrease.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c14_9']	「約法身」下釋向增損，月喻準知。	「約法身」下釋向增損，月喻準知。	In terms of the Dharma body below explains the increase and decrease above, and the moon metaphor can be understood accordingly.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c15_7']	故他不了，見有「減生」之言，判為損生；	故他不了，見有「減生」之言，判為損生；	Therefore, others do not understand. Seeing the words reducing birth classifies it as reducing birth;

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c20_9']	具足應從無生已去，言世及念等以跨多位及以八位不可，即云四十二念等，故寄後位譚之。	具足應從無生已去，言世及念等以跨多位及以八位不可，即云四十二念等，故寄後位譚之。	It should be fully explained from non-birth, speaking of the world, thought, and so on, in order to span many stages and eight stages, which is impossible. It is said to be forty-two thoughts and so on, so it is provisionally explained from the later stage.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c23_5']	經文雖略據位必八，文中一往雖從地判，然超越人增損無定，故云「八世」等，具足應如文中屬對，此則正破因生果生。	經文雖略據位必八，文中一往雖從地判，然超越人增損無定，故云「八世」等，具足應如文中屬對，此則正破因生果生。	Although the text is brief, according to the stages there must be eight. Although the text provisionally divides based on the stages, those who transcend have indeterminate increases and decreases, so it says eight worldly... and so on. It should be fully as corresponding to the text, this then directly refutes the arising of causes and the arising of effects.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c25_10']	今文處處不違《論》文，唯留餘殘脩多羅半品入正，及此授記一向不用，故知凡有去取並不徒然。	今文處處不違《論》文，唯留餘殘脩多羅半品入正，及此授記一向不用，故知凡有去取並不徒然。	The present text everywhere does not contradict the treatise text, only leaving the remaining half chapter of sutra to enter the correct, and this bestowal of prophecy is completely unused. Therefore it is known that there is always a reason for accepting and rejecting.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0341c27_1']	然諸《論》文，無生忍文多在初地，唯《華嚴》、《起信》彰灼明文十住八相。	然諸《論》文，無生忍文多在初地，唯《華嚴》、《起信》彰灼明文十住八相。	However, the treatise texts have many passages on the forbearance of non-arising in the first ground, only the Huayan and the Awakening of Faith clearly state the eight appearances in the ten abodes.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a02_4']	「捃拾」指《涅槃》文，《涅槃》自指八千聲聞於《法華》中得授記莂，如秋收冬藏更無所作，故知大穫須在《法華》，故《大經》中得道眾者，如〈梵行品〉末云：	「捃拾」指《涅槃》文，《涅槃》自指八千聲聞於《法華》中得授記莂，如秋收冬藏更無所作，故知大穫須在《法華》，故《大經》中得道眾者，如〈梵行品〉末云：	Gleaning refers to the Nirvana Sutra. The Nirvana Sutra itself points out that the 8,000 voice-hearers received predictions in the Lotus Sutra, like autumn harvest and winter storage with nothing more to do. Therefore, we know that the great harvest must be in the Lotus Sutra. Thus, the assembly that attained the Way in the Nirvana Sutra, like the end of the Chapter on Pure Practices, says:

Although deep and numerous, compared to the dust of the four continents and the dust of the trichiliocosm in this sūtra, they are not worth mentioning.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a13_6']	今經正宗三周及以本門得益，並不與諸經同也。	今經正宗三周及以本門得益，並不與諸經同也。	The main teaching of this sūtra, the three periods and the chapter on the original state, the benefits obtained are not the same as in other sūtras.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a16_2']	況流通中自〈藥王〉下六品，品品之中皆有結得道者，皆過八萬，〈勸發品〉中大千界塵人具普賢道，故知捃拾今經之餘。	況流通中自〈藥王〉下六品，品品之中皆有結得道者，皆過八萬，〈勸發品〉中大千界塵人具普賢道，故知捃拾今經之餘。	Moreover, in the chapter on circulation, from the chapter on Bhaiṣajya-rāja down to the last six chapters, in each chapter there are those who attain the Way, all over eighty thousand. In the chapter on encouragement and inspiration, people as numerous as the dust motes in the great trichiliocosm fully possess the path of Samantabhadra. Therefore, we know that this is the gleaning of the remainder of this sūtra.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a21_7']	雖然，爾前諸味之權文，為今經之方便，爾後《涅槃》捃拾此機，乃至扶律明一乘常住，得此經旨，一毫行一句法無非法界，十方佛法起平等見，而常分別諸佛化儀，方稱斯經一乘之旨，應思我等為何所依方稱此經弘宣之相。	雖然，爾前諸味之權文，為今經之方便，爾後《涅槃》捃拾此機，乃至扶律明一乘常住，得此經旨，一毫行一句法無非法界，十方佛法起平等見，而常分別諸佛化儀，方稱斯經一乘之旨，應思我等為何所依方稱此經弘宣之相。	However, the provisional teachings of the previous flavors are the skillful means for this sutra, and the Nirvana Sutra later gathers up this potential, up to supporting the precepts and clarifying the eternal One Vehicle. If one understands the meaning of this sutra, even a single hair or a single phrase of Dharma is the Dharma realm, and one gives rise to an equal view of the Buddhas' teachings in the ten directions, while always distinguishing the Buddhas' methods of transformation, only then does one live up to the meaning of the One Vehicle in this sutra. One should contemplate what we rely on in order to live up to the appearance of promoting this sutra.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a22_10']	「上迹門菩薩」等者，準上開章，此中正當領解段也。	「上迹門菩薩」等者，準上開章，此中正當領解段也。	The bodhisattvas in the chapter on the traces above and so on, according to the above outline, this is precisely the section on understanding in this chapter.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a23_4']	前分別門即是第二授記段也。	前分別門即是第二授記段也。	The previous section on distinctions is precisely the second section on receiving the prediction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a24_13']	所以迹門雖記二乘，佛旨未周收機未盡，故諸菩薩未陳領解；	所以迹門雖記二乘，佛旨未周收機未盡，故諸菩薩未陳領解；	Although the traces chapter predicts the two vehicles, the Buddha's meaning is not yet complete and the potential has not yet been exhausted, so the bodhisattvas have not yet expressed their understanding;
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342a29_7']	今以供養而表領解，故迹門中諸天領解亦申供養，諸聲聞人久修自行，但直領解而無供養，聞本門已與諸菩薩，同申供養重表領解，以聞本後薄修行願，俱成菩薩同獻供養，隨其位行以供表之。	今以供養而表領解，故迹門中諸天領解亦申供養，諸聲聞人久修自行，但直領解而無供養，聞本門已與諸菩薩，同申供養重表領解，以聞本後薄修行願，俱成菩薩同獻供養，隨其位行以供表之。	Now, by making offerings, he expresses his understanding. Therefore, in the chapter on the traces, the heavenly beings also make offerings to express their understanding. The śrāvaka disciples have long cultivated their own practices, so they only express their understanding without making offerings. After hearing the chapter on the origin, they, together with the bodhisattvas, make offerings to express their understanding again. They wish to cultivate the practices of the origin and become bodhisattvas together, so they offer their offerings. According to their stages and practices, they express it through offerings.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b01_16']	故云「次第」及「番番」等，別立品目，是故文中以陳供養作所表釋。	故云「次第」及「番番」等，別立品目，是故文中以陳供養作所表釋。	Therefore, it is said in order and in turn, and so on. This is why the chapter titles are established separately. Therefore, in the text, the offerings are made as an explanation of what is expressed.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b03_12']	「南師從此為流通」者，意以四信信解功德，亦屬流通，不須必到滅後五品。	「南師從此為流通」者，意以四信信解功德，亦屬流通，不須必到滅後五品。	The Southern Master takes this as the circulation means that the merit of faith and understanding of the four kinds of faith also belongs to the circulation, and it is not necessary to reach the five categories after the Buddha's extinction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b05_2']	「文殊」等者，如迹門後文殊入海教化通經，豈必在於佛滅後耶？	「文殊」等者，如迹門後文殊入海教化通經，豈必在於佛滅後耶？	Mañjuśrī and so on means that after the chapter on the traces, Mañjuśrī enters the ocean to teach and spread the sūtra. How could it necessarily be after the Buddha's extinction?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b05_12']	故進退二途並可承用。	故進退二途並可承用。	Therefore, both approaches can be accepted.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b06_16']	準此文意，三周之後文殊方始入海教化，義亦未失。	準此文意，三周之後文殊方始入海教化，義亦未失。	According to this passage, after the three periods, Mañjuśrī then entered the ocean to teach and transform. The meaning is also not lost.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b08_3']	但菩薩事迹不可思議，勿以凡情而商度之，已如前說。	但菩薩事迹不可思議，勿以凡情而商度之，已如前說。	But the traces of the bodhisattva are inconceivable, do not use ordinary emotions to discuss them, as already explained above.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b10_12']	況準迹門，無領記後猶屬正者，故依南方初品果者，且以五品對於相似，一往說耳，分果遠果仍須指後。	況準迹門，無領記後猶屬正者，故依南方初品果者，且以五品對於相似，一往說耳，分果遠果仍須指後。	Moreover, according to the traces gate, there is still the main part after the acceptance of the record, therefore, relying on the first fruit of the southern direction, it is said that the five categories correspond to similarity, just a rough explanation. The divided fruit and distant fruit still need to be pointed out later.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b11_3']	「如上說」者指授記文。	「如上說」者指授記文。	As explained above refers to the text of the prediction.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b11_16']	「云何四信」者，問意兩兼：	「云何四信」者，問意兩兼：	What are the four kinds of faith? The meaning of the question is twofold:
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b12_3']	一問云何但立四數？	一問云何但立四數？	First, it asks why only four numbers are established.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b12_12']	二問云何四俱名信？	二問云何四俱名信？	Second, it asks why all four are called faith.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b12_20']	「略解」去釋也。	「略解」去釋也。	Brief explanation is the explanation.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b14_3']	四人通名為信，則二義俱成，攝五成四不須至五。	四人通名為信，則二義俱成，攝五成四不須至五。	If the four people are generally called faith, then both meanings are accomplished. Including five and forming four, there is no need to reach five.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b14_14']	又名從初得，故俱名信。	又名從初得，故俱名信。	Moreover, the name is obtained from the beginning, so they are all called faith.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b16_16']	「略解三人」者，去通從別則受別名，廣及觀成必有略故，故略通三人唯除初信，初無解故。	「略解三人」者，去通從別則受別名，廣及觀成必有略故，故略通三人唯除初信，初無解故。	Briefly explaining three types of people means that if we remove the general and follow the specific, we receive the specific name. The extensive and the accomplishment of contemplation must have the brief, therefore the brief is common to the three types of people, only excluding the initial faith, because the initial one has no understanding.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b17_16']	「廣說二人」除略解者，廣局第三不通前二。	「廣說二人」除略解者，廣局第三不通前二。	Explaining the extensive to two types of people excludes those with brief understanding. The extensive is limited to the third and does not extend to the first two.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b19_11']	「觀成一人」復除廣解不通餘三，除信一事餘不通四，唯信解四名為四信。	「觀成一人」復除廣解不通餘三，除信一事餘不通四，唯信解四名為四信。	The accomplishment of contemplation to one type of person further excludes those with extensive understanding and does not extend to the remaining three. Excluding one matter of faith, the rest do not extend to the four. Only the four types of faith and understanding are called the four faiths.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b21_11']	若一念信解未有下三，乃是初信最局，略具初信、廣具初二、觀必具三，故後漸寬。	若一念信解未有下三，乃是初信最局，略具初信、廣具初二、觀必具三，故後漸寬。	If there is momentary faith and understanding without the following three, this is the initial faith, which is the most limited. The brief possesses the initial faith, the extensive possesses the first two, and the contemplation necessarily possesses the three, therefore the latter gradually expands.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342b22_6']	但後後者勝於前前，故成後局。	但後後者勝於前前，故成後局。	But the latter is superior to the former, therefore it becomes limited in the latter.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342c02_18']	又信如來化功長遠，是人能知本迹妙理是佛本證；	又信如來化功長遠，是人能知本迹妙理是佛本證；	And believing that the Tathāgata's transformative power is long-lasting, this person is able to know the wondrous principle of the original and traces, which is the Buddha's original realization;
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342c04_7']	若但秖信事中遠壽，何能令此諸菩薩等增道損生至於極位？	若但秖信事中遠壽，何能令此諸菩薩等增道損生至於極位？	If one only believes in the distant longevity in the events, how can it cause these bodhisattvas to increase the path, reduce birth, and reach the ultimate stage?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342c05_13']	故信解本地難思境智，信心初轉自在無礙，方名為力。	故信解本地難思境智，信心初轉自在無礙，方名為力。	Therefore, believing and understanding the inconceivable realm and wisdom of the original ground, the initial turning of the mind of faith is free and unobstructed, and is then called power.
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342c06_8']	尚能增進以至一生，況信力耶？	尚能增進以至一生，況信力耶？	One is still able to make progress and reach the stage of one life, let alone the power of faith?
['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342c06_20']	「罣」者，戶卦切，礙也。	「罣」者，戶卦切，礙也。	Gui is pronounced as hu gua, meaning obstruction.

['ZH_T34_1719_10a:0342c09_1']	釋成者，謂能達九界非道，純佛法界妙道之用。	釋成者，謂能達九界非道，純佛法界妙道之用。	Explanation means being able to reach the wonderful function of the Dharma realm of the pure Buddha, which is not the path of the nine realms.

However, upholding the precepts is not yet the aspect of upholding the eighty thousand precepts of the Brahma's Net. It is just that the vessels in this land are inferior, and for now, the small precepts assist in forming the great precepts. One should still understand the reasons for revealing and concealing, the light and heavy causes and effects, the gradual and sudden establishment of causes and effects, the meaning of abandoning or not, the division of seating order, the difference in repentance methods, and whether the seven assemblies are the same or different. Only then can one, in one's own practice, measure one's level and take what is appropriate for the time. Some admire the great principles but are oblivious to existence and nonexistence, while some rely on small texts but are confused about the path of contemplation.
