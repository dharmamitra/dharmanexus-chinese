['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853a16_5']	但斯經文約義富、意遠義深，略闡未彰、廣敷似現，故博採南北、捃拾古今，復撿經論，微加檀思，實有過半之功，庶免徒勞之弊。	但斯經文約義富、意遠義深，略闡未彰、廣敷似現，故博採南北、捃拾古今，復撿經論，微加檀思，實有過半之功，庶免徒勞之弊。	However, the text of this sutra is concise in meaning but rich, and the meaning is far-reaching and profound. It has not been fully revealed in brief explanations, but seems to be present in extensive expositions. Therefore, I have extensively collected from the north and south, gathered from ancient times to the present, and examined sutras and treatises, adding a little thought, truly having more than half the merit, hoping to avoid the harm of vain labor.

The ultimate truth is inexpressible, yet the profound teachings spread everywhere. Therefore, know that there is no form yet nothing is not formed, no words yet nothing is not spoken.

The extensive teaching is divided into three sections - the inconceivable liberation of Vimalakīrti, 1. The original inconceivable liberation of Vimalakīrti refers to the non-dual Dharma gate.
['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853b19_17']	所以然者，由體不二之道，故有無二之智；	所以然者，由體不二之道，故有無二之智；	The reason for this is that because the essence is the way of non-duality, there is the wisdom of non-duality;
['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853b20_10']	由無二之智，故能適化無方。	由無二之智，故能適化無方。	Because there is the wisdom of non-duality, it is able to adapt and transform without bounds.

['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853c01_13']	二文殊雖明不二無言，而猶言於無言，所謂中也。	二文殊雖明不二無言，而猶言於無言，所謂中也。	Second, although Mañjuśrī clarifies that non-duality is beyond words, he still speaks of the absence of words, which is the middle level.
['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853c02_17']	三淨名𭇃默鑒不二無言，而能無言於無言，所謂上也。	三淨名𭇃默鑒不二無言，而能無言於無言，所謂上也。	Third, the silence of Vimalakīrti's contemplation is the non-duality of no words, yet he can be wordless in the absence of words, which is called the highest.
['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853c03_12']	良以道超四句，故至聖以之沖默。	良以道超四句，故至聖以之沖默。	It is precisely because the Way transcends the four propositions that the ultimate sage is tranquil and silent through it.

['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853c06_17']	既云至趣無言、玄藉彌布，即是言於無言，乃見文殊之言深、淨名之默淺。	既云至趣無言、玄藉彌布，即是言於無言，乃見文殊之言深、淨名之默淺。	Since it is said that the ultimate approach is wordless, yet the profound scriptures spread everywhere, this is precisely speaking of the absence of words, and only then can we see that Mañjuśrī's words are profound and Vimalakīrti's silence is shallow.

['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853c14_19']	文殊雖唱理無言，而猶言於至理，亦未稱理。	文殊雖唱理無言，而猶言於至理，亦未稱理。	Although Manjushri proclaims the non-verbalization of the principle, he still speaks of the ultimate principle, so he has not yet attained the principle.

['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853c22_20']	蓋是以教惑理，故謂相違。	蓋是以教惑理，故謂相違。	It is because the teaching confuses the principle, so it is said to be contradictory.
['ZH_T38_1780_001:0853c23_11']	若識理一教三，則有如符契。	若識理一教三，則有如符契。	If one understands that the principle is one and the teaching is three, then it is like a tally and a contract.
