['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781a29_20']	如處處經中世尊說三業，謂身業、語業、意業。	如處處經中世尊說三業，謂身業、語業、意業。	001	As it is said in various sūtras, the World-Honored One spoke of three kinds of karma, namely, bodily karma, verbal karma, and mental karma.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b02_16']	此中有說身所造業故名身業，語即是業故名語業，此二皆用表與無表為其自性。	此中有說身所造業故名身業，語即是業故名語業，此二皆用表與無表為其自性。	001	Among them, some say that because it is created by the body, it is called bodily karma. Because speech itself is karma, it is called verbal karma. Both of these take both revealing and non-revealing [karma] as their intrinsic nature.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b03_15']	意相應業故名意業，此業但以思為自性。	意相應業故名意業，此業但以思為自性。	001	Because it is karma associated with the mind, it is called mental karma. This karma is only by its intrinsic nature of volition.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b04_5']	今於此中何法名表？	今於此中何法名表？	001	What dharma is called revealing [karma] here?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b05_4']	且身表業形色為性，緣此為境心等所生。	且身表業形色為性，緣此為境心等所生。	001	First, bodily revealing karma takes shape and color as its nature. It is born from the mind that takes this as its object.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b05_13']	誰之形色謂身形色？	誰之形色謂身形色？	001	Whose shape and color? It means the shape and color of the body.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b06_11']	若身形色，何故前言身所造業故名身業？	若身形色，何故前言身所造業故名身業？	001	If it is the shape and color of the body, why was it said earlier that because it is created by the body, it is called bodily karma?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b07_7']	謂總名身一分攝故，名身形色。	謂總名身一分攝故，名身形色。	001	It means because it is included in one part of the body as a whole, it is called the shape and color of the body.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b08_1']	依身大種而發生故，名身所造。	依身大種而發生故，名身所造。	001	Because it arises in dependence on the great elements of the body, it is called created by the body.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b08_19']	以總身言於別亦轉，如世間說居邑住林。	以總身言於別亦轉，如世間說居邑住林。	001	When speaking of the body as a whole, it also applies to the individual parts, just as the world says that one dwells in a town or in a forest.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b09_12']	何緣復說緣此為境心等所生？	何緣復說緣此為境心等所生？	001	Why is it also said that the mind, etc., that arises taking this as its object?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b11_2']	為欲簡彼脣等形色，彼非緣彼心等所生，以緣言音心等生故。	為欲簡彼脣等形色，彼非緣彼心等所生，以緣言音心等生故。	001	In order to distinguish it from the shape and color of the lips, etc., which are not produced by the mind, etc., that takes them as its object, because it is produced by the mind, etc., that takes sound as its object.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b12_14']	又為簡彼宿願心等所引形色，彼非緣彼心等所生，餘異熟因心等生故。	又為簡彼宿願心等所引形色，彼非緣彼心等所生，餘異熟因心等生故。	001	It is also in order to distinguish it from the shape and color that is attracted by the mind, etc., of a previous vow, which is not produced by the mind, etc., that takes it as its object, because it is produced by the mind, etc., that is the cause of retribution for something else.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b12_19']	何故名表？	何故名表？	001	Why is it called indication?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b13_12']	此能表示自發業心令他知故。	此能表示自發業心令他知故。	001	Because it can indicate the mind that produces its own action and cause others to know it.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b14_3']	為顯此義，故說頌言：	為顯此義，故說頌言：	001	In order to show this meaning, a verse is spoken:
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b15_0']	由外發身語，　　表內心所思，	由外發身語，　　表內心所思，	001	By externally emitting body and speech, it indicates the thought that arises internally in the mind,
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b16_13']	譬彼潛淵魚，　　鼓波而自表。	譬彼潛淵魚，　　鼓波而自表。	001	Just like a fish hidden in the deep water, it beats the waves and indicates itself.

['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b18_3']	謂於彼生長等名想。	謂於彼生長等名想。	001	It refers to the names and concepts of long, etc., that arise in relation to it.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b18_9']	此攝在何處？	此攝在何處？	001	In which category is this included?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b18_15']	謂色處所攝。	謂色處所攝。	001	It is included in the sense field of form.

['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b20_13']	為別一物遍色等聚？	為別一物遍色等聚？	001	Or is it a separate entity that pervades aggregates such as form, etc.?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b20_18']	設爾何失？	設爾何失？	001	If so, what is wrong?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b22_7']	長等若是極微差別，應如顯色，諸色聚中一一細分，長等可取。	長等若是極微差別，應如顯色，諸色聚中一一細分，長等可取。	001	If length, etc. were distinctions of atoms, then in each subtle part of a mass of form, length, etc. could be apprehended, just as with visible form.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b23_10']	若是極微差別積聚，此與顯色極微積聚有何差別？	若是極微差別積聚，此與顯色極微積聚有何差別？	001	If they were accumulations of distinctions of atoms, what would be the difference between them and the accumulation of atoms of visible form?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b24_5']	即諸顯色積聚差別應成長等。	即諸顯色積聚差別應成長等。	001	The distinction of the accumulation of visible form itself should be length, etc.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b25_19']	若別一物遍色等聚，一故遍故，一一分中應全可取，於一切分皆具有故；	若別一物遍色等聚，一故遍故，一一分中應全可取，於一切分皆具有故；	001	If it is a separate entity that pervades aggregates such as form, etc., then because it is unitary and pervasive, it should be wholly apprehensible in each part, because it exists in all parts;
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b26_13']	或應非一，於諸分中各別住故。	或應非一，於諸分中各別住故。	001	or it should not be unitary, because it abides separately in the parts.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b27_7']	又壞自宗十處皆是極微積集。	又壞自宗十處皆是極微積集。	001	Moreover, it contradicts one's own doctrine that the ten bases are all accumulations of atoms.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781b28_6']	又應朋助食米齊宗執實有分遍諸分故。	又應朋助食米齊宗執實有分遍諸分故。	001	Moreover, one should support the doctrine of the Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr, because they hold that real unities pervade their parts.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c05_8']	即於和合諸聚色中，見一面多便起長覺、見一面少便起短覺、見四面等便起方覺、見諸面滿便起圓覺、見中凸出便起高覺、見中坳凹便起下覺、見面齊平起於正覺、見面參差起不正覺，如旋轉輪觀錦繡時便生種種異形類覺，不應實有異類形色同在一處如諸顯色。	即於和合諸聚色中，見一面多便起長覺、見一面少便起短覺、見四面等便起方覺、見諸面滿便起圓覺、見中凸出便起高覺、見中坳凹便起下覺、見面齊平起於正覺、見面參差起不正覺，如旋轉輪觀錦繡時便生種種異形類覺，不應實有異類形色同在一處如諸顯色。	001	In the case of all the various colors that are combined, when one side is seen to be long, one produces the notion of long. When one side is seen to be short, one produces the notion of short. When the four sides are seen to be equal, one produces the notion of square. When all the sides are seen to be full, one produces the notion of round. When the center is seen to be convex, one produces the notion of high. When the center is seen to be concave, one produces the notion of low. When the sides are seen to be even, one produces the notion of correct. When the sides are seen to be uneven, one produces the notion of incorrect. When one sees a spinning wheel or brocade, one produces various notions of different forms. But there should not really be different kinds of colored forms existing in the same place, like the various colors.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c06_5']	若許爾者，應於一一處起一切形覺。	若許爾者，應於一一處起一切形覺。	001	If one admits this, then one should produce all notions of form in regard to each individual place.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c08_7', 'ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c08_12']	然無是事，是故形色無別有體，即諸顯色於諸方面安布不同起長等覺，如樹蟻等行列無過。🔽若爾云何？	然無是事，是故形色無別有體，即諸顯色於諸方面安布不同起長等覺，如樹蟻等行列無過。 若爾云何？	001	But this is not the case. Therefore form does not have a separate substance. It is just the various colors that, when arranged differently in the various directions, produce the notions of long, etc., just as there is no error in the case of trees, ants, etc., being arranged in a line.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c09_7']	於遠闇處不了顯色，了形色耶？	於遠闇處不了顯色，了形色耶？	001	If this is so, then how is it that when one is far away or in the dark, one does not perceive the colors but perceives the form?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c10_5']	如何不了樹等形色，而能了彼行列形耶？	如何不了樹等形色，而能了彼行列形耶？	001	How can one perceive the shape of a row without perceiving the shape of the trees?
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c12_13']	然離樹等無別行列，或於遠闇諸聚色中若顯若形俱不能了，雖復能取而不分明，疑是何物、此何所見？	然離樹等無別行列，或於遠闇諸聚色中若顯若形俱不能了，雖復能取而不分明，疑是何物、此何所見？	001	However, apart from the trees there is no separate row. Or, in the case of distant or dark masses of color, if the manifestation or shape cannot be perceived, although one is able to grasp it, it is not clear, and one doubts what it is or what one is seeing.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c14_1']	由是應知但取顯色，由遠闇故見不分明，故表是形理不成立。	由是應知但取顯色，由遠闇故見不分明，故表是形理不成立。	001	Therefore, one should know that one only grasps manifest color. Because of distance and darkness, one sees unclearly. Therefore, the theory that indication is shape is not established.

['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c16_11']	何緣復說緣此為境心等所生？	何緣復說緣此為境心等所生？	001	Why is it also said that it is produced by mind and so forth, taking this as its object?

['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c20_3']	謂差別相不可知故。	謂差別相不可知故。	001	Because the specific characteristics cannot be known.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c22_2']	此理不然，如熟變物，雖纔觸火，光雪酢等諸熟變緣即有差別，而不可知彼差別相。	此理不然，如熟變物，雖纔觸火，光雪酢等諸熟變緣即有差別，而不可知彼差別相。	001	This reasoning is not correct. It is like a cooked object. Although when it is just touched by fire, light, snow, vinegar, and other conditions of cooking, there are differences, but their specific characteristics cannot be known.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c22_16']	然彼前後非無有異，此亦應然。	然彼前後非無有異，此亦應然。	001	However, there are differences between them before and after. This should also be so.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c24_4']	如長薪草眾分相似，各別生焰雖有差別，而不可知彼差別相。	如長薪草眾分相似，各別生焰雖有差別，而不可知彼差別相。	001	It is like a long piece of firewood or grass. Although the flames produced by each part are different due to their similarities, their specific characteristics cannot be known.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c24_18']	然彼眾分非無有異，此亦應然。	然彼眾分非無有異，此亦應然。	001	However, there are differences between those parts. This should also be so.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c26_11']	若熟變物纔觸緣時諸熟變相不即生者，彼於後時亦應不生，緣無異故。	若熟變物纔觸緣時諸熟變相不即生者，彼於後時亦應不生，緣無異故。	001	If the characteristics of cooking of a cooked object do not arise immediately when it is just touched by conditions, they should also not arise later, because the conditions are no different.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0781c28_8']	若長薪草眾分相似非分分中別生焰者，彼焰應無，由彼別故形量照明焰熱差別。	若長薪草眾分相似非分分中別生焰者，彼焰應無，由彼別故形量照明焰熱差別。	001	If the parts of a long piece of firewood or grass are similar and the flames do not arise separately in each part, then those flames should not exist, because they are different in shape, size, illumination, and the differences of flames and heat.
['ZH_T31_1609_001:0782a01_2']	是故不應以差別相不可知故，便謂即此轉至餘方，應審了知彼差別相。	是故不應以差別相不可知故，便謂即此轉至餘方，應審了知彼差別相。	001	Therefore, you should not say that because the specific characteristics of the transformation are not known, it is the same dharma that moves to another place. You should carefully understand the specific characteristics of that transformation.

['ZH_T31_1609_001:0782a11_1']	然焰聲滅不待風手，薪等亦然不應為難。	然焰聲滅不待風手，薪等亦然不應為難。	001	But the flame and the sound are extinguished without the wind or the hand, and the same is true of fuel, etc. This should not be a problem.

Two mutually contradictory dharmas are not produced by the same cause, as is well established in the world.
