The question is: Can the wholesome mind of added effort give rise to precepts? The teacher Kong has three explanations: First, the wholesome mind of added effort cannot give rise to precepts.
['ZH_T41_1821_017:0265a19_17']	戒是斷善捨。	戒是斷善捨。	Precepts are abandoned when one cuts off the wholesome roots.

['ZH_T41_1821_017:0265a23_14']	將斷善時。	將斷善時。	When about to sever good roots,
['ZH_T41_1821_017:0265a24_5']	必先作法捨彼戒故。	必先作法捨彼戒故。	one must first perform the rite to abandon those precepts.
