The fundamental practice is established in order to know others' minds. Although when it is perfected it also knows mental factors, it is established as the name of the knowledge of others' minds based on the practice.

['ZH_T29_1558_026:0135c09_11']	苦等四智一一各有緣自諦境四種行相。	苦等四智一一各有緣自諦境四種行相。	026	Each of the four knowledges of suffering, etc., has four aspects that take as their object the truth of suffering, etc., respectively.
['ZH_T29_1558_026:0135c11_2']	他心智中，若無漏者唯有緣道四種行相，由此即是道智攝故；	他心智中，若無漏者唯有緣道四種行相，由此即是道智攝故；	026	As for the knowledge of other’s minds, if it is pure, it has only the four aspects of the truth of the path, because it is categorized as the knowledge of the path.

['ZH_T29_1558_026:0135c13_2']	如境自相行相亦爾，故此非前十六所攝。	如境自相行相亦爾，故此非前十六所攝。	026	The aspects are like the self-characteristics of the object, and therefore this knowledge is not included in the previous sixteen.
