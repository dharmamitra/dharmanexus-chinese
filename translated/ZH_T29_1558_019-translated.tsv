['ZH_T29_1558_019:0098c20_11']	無違經失，并隨眠者并隨縛故。	無違經失，并隨眠者并隨縛故。	019	There is no fault of contradicting the sūtras, because together with the latent tendencies means together with the bonds.

['ZH_T29_1558_019:0098c23_2']	阿毘達磨依實相說，即諸煩惱說名隨眠，由此隨眠是相應法。	阿毘達磨依實相說，即諸煩惱說名隨眠，由此隨眠是相應法。	019	The Abhidharma teaches in accordance with the real characteristics, which is to say that the afflictions themselves are called the latent tendencies. For this reason, the latent tendencies are associated dharmas.

In the state of sleep of the passions, they are called latent afflictions, and in the state of awakening, they are called entanglements.

['ZH_T29_1558_019:0099a16_20']	言貪分二，謂欲、有貪。	言貪分二，謂欲、有貪。	019	It is said that craving is divided into two: craving for desire and craving for existence.

['ZH_T29_1558_019:0099a18_16']	彼貪多託內門轉故。	彼貪多託內門轉故。	019	Because that craving often arises from the internal sense bases.
['ZH_T29_1558_019:0099a20_6']	謂彼二界多起定貪，一切定貪於內門轉，故唯於彼立有貪名。	謂彼二界多起定貪，一切定貪於內門轉，故唯於彼立有貪名。	019	It is said that in the two realms, craving for meditative absorption often arises. All craving for meditative absorption arises from the internal sense bases. Therefore, only for them is the name craving for existence established.
['ZH_T29_1558_019:0099a22_16']	又由有人於上二界起解脫想，為遮彼故，謂於上界立有貪名，顯彼所緣非真解脫，此中自體立以有名。	又由有人於上二界起解脫想，為遮彼故，謂於上界立有貪名，顯彼所緣非真解脫，此中自體立以有名。	019	Moreover, there are people who give rise to the notion of liberation in the two upper realms. In order to refute them, it is said that in the upper realms, the name craving for existence is established. It is shown that the objects of that craving are not true liberation. Here, the name existence is established based on its own essence.
['ZH_T29_1558_019:0099a24_6']	彼諸有情多於等至及所依止深生味著，故說彼唯味著自體；	彼諸有情多於等至及所依止深生味著，故說彼唯味著自體；	019	Because sentient beings often deeply cling to meditative absorption and its basis, it is said that they only cling to their own essence.
['ZH_T29_1558_019:0099a25_7']	非味著境，離欲貪故，由此唯彼立有貪名。	非味著境，離欲貪故，由此唯彼立有貪名。	019	Because they are free from craving for objects of taste, therefore only they are called craving for existence.
['ZH_T29_1558_019:0099a26_16']	既說有貪在上二界，義准欲界貪名欲貪，故於頌中不別顯示。	既說有貪在上二界，義准欲界貪名欲貪，故於頌中不別顯示。	019	Since it is said that craving for existence exists in the two upper realms, by implication craving in the desire realm is called craving for desire, therefore it is not separately indicated in the verse.
