In this way, thirty days make a month, twelve months make a year, and in this way, in a hundred thousand myriad years, they give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment and see the Tathāgata once. In this way, the number of Buddhas they give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment and see is like the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River.
