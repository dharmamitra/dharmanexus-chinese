['ZH_T37_1751_004:0216b22_3']	故《大經》二十二云「菩薩所得清淨天眼，異於聲聞緣覺所得。	故《大經》二十二云「菩薩所得清淨天眼，異於聲聞緣覺所得。	004	Therefore, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, fascicle 22, says: The pure heavenly eye obtained by bodhisattvas is different from that obtained by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218b29_23']	初、分科。	初、分科。	004	First, the division of topics.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c01_1']	二、隨釋，四：	二、隨釋，四：	004	Second, following the explanation, in four parts:
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c02_13']	初「漸想」者，轉於氷想用表瑠璃，雖復觀地種種莊嚴，未稱彼佛勝應所居。	初「漸想」者，轉於氷想用表瑠璃，雖復觀地種種莊嚴，未稱彼佛勝應所居。	004	First, gradual thought means transforming the thought of ice to express lapis lazuli. Although one contemplates the various adornments of the earth, it is not yet in accord with the abode of the Buddha's supreme manifestation.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c03_15']	良以三觀尚微，猶兼假想，故於彼地名為粗見。	良以三觀尚微，猶兼假想，故於彼地名為粗見。	004	This is because the three contemplations are still subtle and still involve false imagination, so it is called roughly seeing in that ground.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c04_2']	二、「若得」下，實觀。	二、「若得」下，實觀。	004	Second, If one attains and below is the true contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c05_10']	妙觀功著三昧有成，見彼勝身所依之地，莊嚴之相豈可具陳。	妙觀功著三昧有成，見彼勝身所依之地，莊嚴之相豈可具陳。	004	The wonderful contemplation is accomplished, and samādhi is attained. Seeing the land that is the basis of the supreme body, how can the characteristics of the adornments be fully described?
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c06_4']	應了同居橫具三土，其相非少。	應了同居橫具三土，其相非少。	004	One should understand that the same abode horizontally possesses the three lands, and its characteristics are not few.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c07_15']	如諸經說，凡小善行迴向求生，縱依大乘仍是散善，故感養淨相猶劣。	如諸經說，凡小善行迴向求生，縱依大乘仍是散善，故感養淨相猶劣。	004	As the sutras say, ordinary and inferior wholesome practices that are dedicated and aspire to rebirth, even if based on the Mahayana, are still scattered wholesome [actions]. Therefore, the appearance of the pure land that is experienced is still inferior.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c08_15']	若今頓教心觀妙宗，所見淨相永異他部。	若今頓教心觀妙宗，所見淨相永異他部。	004	If one now uses the wonderful principles of the mind's contemplation in the sudden teachings, the appearance of the pure land that is seen is forever different from other schools.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c10_4']	如修妙觀於同居穢，尚見尊特及實報土，豈淨同居身土一槩？	如修妙觀於同居穢，尚見尊特及實報土，豈淨同居身土一槩？	004	Just as cultivating the wonderful contemplation sees the honored and special, as well as the land of true recompense, even in the defiled same-dwelling [land]. How could the body and land of the pure same-dwelling [land] be the same in all aspects?
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c11_3']	故今地想妙三昧成，見莊嚴事不可具說。	故今地想妙三昧成，見莊嚴事不可具說。	004	Therefore, now that the wonderful samādhi of the earth contemplation is accomplished, the adorned things that are seen cannot be fully described.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c11_15']	三、「佛告」下，明利益。	三、「佛告」下，明利益。	004	Third, from The Buddha said is the explanation of the benefits.

It is only a conceptualization, so it is called a rough seeing.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c13_19']	今成三昧，實見彼地，則名實觀。	今成三昧，實見彼地，則名實觀。	004	Now that the samādhi is accomplished, one truly sees that ground, and it is then called a real contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c15_5']	言假想不能滅罪，斯是大師順經策進，令其行者速成三昧；	言假想不能滅罪，斯是大師順經策進，令其行者速成三昧；	004	It is said that conceptualization cannot eliminate offenses. This is the great teacher following the sutra to encourage progress, causing practitioners to quickly accomplish the samādhi;
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c15_14']	非是假想全不滅罪。	非是假想全不滅罪。	004	it is not that conceptualization does not eliminate offenses at all.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c15_19']	何以知然？	何以知然？	004	How do we know this?
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c17_3']	日觀尚類下品下生滅罪之數，豈粗見地全不除愆？	日觀尚類下品下生滅罪之數，豈粗見地全不除愆？	004	The sun contemplation is still similar to the number of sins eliminated by the lowest of the low grade of rebirth. How could the shallow seeing of the ground completely eliminate offenses?
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c17_15']	四、「作此」下，顯邪正。	四、「作此」下，顯邪正。	004	Fourth, from doing this below, it shows the correct and the deviant.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c18_6']	觀與經合則稱性見，名為正觀。	觀與經合則稱性見，名為正觀。	004	Contemplation that accords with the sutra is seeing in accordance with the nature, and is called correct contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c18_20']	見相乖經是發魔事，故名邪觀。	見相乖經是發魔事，故名邪觀。	004	Seeing that deviates from the sutra is giving rise to demonic activities, and is therefore called deviant contemplation.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c19_4']	下去皆然。	下去皆然。	004	The same applies to what follows.

Still, one understands that the contemplation itself is originally endowed with this Dharma, relying on the objective realm to form the contemplation, causing the inherent Dharma to manifest in the mind's eye. Therefore, the mental contemplation and the characteristics that arise are all threefold.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0218c26_17']	故知通論皆得有境。	故知通論皆得有境。	004	Therefore, one should know that in general discussion, all can have an objective realm.

All this is due to the wonderful contemplation turning deeper, and thus the objects of contemplation become increasingly excellent.

['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b16_20']	初義者，謂出定憶持。	初義者，謂出定憶持。	004	The first meaning refers to recollecting while coming out of concentration.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b18_4']	定中聞法，須與經中所說符契，故云「令與教法相應」。	定中聞法，須與經中所說符契，故云「令與教法相應」。	004	The Dharma heard in concentration must correspond with what is explained in the sutra, thus it says to make it correspond with the teachings.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b19_9']	次意者，謂心雖出定，對彼五塵須息愛憎，淨乎身口三業。	次意者，謂心雖出定，對彼五塵須息愛憎，淨乎身口三業。	004	The next meaning refers to the mind, although coming out of concentration, still needing to cease love and hatred in the face of the five sense objects and purify the three karmas of body, speech, and mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b20_14']	若爾，雖不住定亦聞法音，故云「出定入定常聞妙法」。	若爾，雖不住定亦聞法音，故云「出定入定常聞妙法」。	004	If so, although not abiding in concentration, one still hears the sound of the Dharma, thus it says constantly hearing the wonderful Dharma whether coming out of or entering concentration.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b21_19']	言「與十二部經教合」者，以十二部總稱修多羅，同名為經。	言「與十二部經教合」者，以十二部總稱修多羅，同名為經。	004	As for corresponding with the teachings of the twelve divisions of the canon, the twelve divisions are collectively called sutras and are all called sutras.

Therefore, the sūtras are called concentration.

If it is definitely not in accord with the sutra, or if it is not in accord with concentration, it all gives rise to demonic activities, and is completely not the meditation of contemplating the image, therefore it is called false imagination.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b27_12']	若已合名麁想見極樂界者，謂以經驗定無差、出定與在定相似，得名麁想見彼國界。	若已合名麁想見極樂界者，謂以經驗定無差、出定與在定相似，得名麁想見彼國界。	004	If it is already in accord, it is called a coarse thought seeing the realm of Ultimate Bliss. This means that through experience, one knows that the concentration is without error, and coming out of concentration is similar to being in concentration, and one can be called having a coarse thought seeing that country's realm.

['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b28_15']	以像望真，須分麁妙。	以像望真，須分麁妙。	004	Comparing the image to the true, one must distinguish between coarse and wonderful.
['ZH_T37_1751_004:0221b29_12']	此想乃是佛觀方便，豈可全同真佛觀邪？	此想乃是佛觀方便，豈可全同真佛觀邪？	004	This thought is a skillful means for contemplating the Buddha. How can it be completely the same as the true contemplation of the Buddha?
