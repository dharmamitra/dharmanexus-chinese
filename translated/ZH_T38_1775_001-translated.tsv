['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327a15_3']	之稱也。	之稱也。	001	The preface to the Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra states that it is the ultimate expression of the exhaustion of subtle transformations and the transcendence of wondrousness.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327a18_4']	其旨淵玄、非言象所測，道越三空、非二乘所議，超群數之表、絕有心之境，眇莾無為而無不為、罔知所以然而能然者，不思議也。	其旨淵玄、非言象所測，道越三空、非二乘所議，超群數之表、絕有心之境，眇莾無為而無不為、罔知所以然而能然者，不思議也。	001	Its purport is profound and mysterious, beyond the comprehension of words and images. The Way surpasses the three emptinesses and is not discussed by the two vehicles. It transcends the realm of numbers and cuts off the realm of the mind of existence. It is vast and non-action, yet there is nothing it does not do. It is unknown why it is so, yet it can be so. This is the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327a18_7']	何則？	何則？	001	Why is it so?
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327a23_13']	夫聖智無知而萬品俱照、法身無象而殊形並應，至韻無言而玄籍彌布、冥權無謀而動與事會，故能統濟群方、開物成務，利見天下、於我無為，而惑者覩感照因謂之智、觀應形則謂之身、覿玄籍便謂之言、見變動而謂之權。	夫聖智無知而萬品俱照、法身無象而殊形並應，至韻無言而玄籍彌布、冥權無謀而動與事會，故能統濟群方、開物成務，利見天下、於我無為，而惑者覩感照因謂之智、觀應形則謂之身、覿玄籍便謂之言、見變動而謂之權。	001	The sage's wisdom is without knowledge yet illuminates myriad things, the Dharma body is without form yet responds to all appearances, the ultimate melody is without words yet the profound scriptures spread far and wide, the hidden power is without plans yet its movements accord with events. Therefore, it can unify the myriad approaches, reveal things and accomplish tasks, benefiting the world without doing anything for itself. Yet the confused see the illuminating response and call it wisdom, observe the responding form and call it the body, encounter the profound scriptures and call it words, see the changes and call it power.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327a24_15']	夫道之極者，豈可以形言權智而語其神域哉！	夫道之極者，豈可以形言權智而語其神域哉！	001	How can the ultimate of the Way be spoken of in terms of form, words, power, and wisdom, and discussed in terms of its spiritual realm?
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327a27_8']	然群生長寢、非言莫曉，道不孤運、弘之由人，是以如來命文殊於異方、召維摩於他土，爰集毘耶，共弘斯道。	然群生長寢、非言莫曉，道不孤運、弘之由人，是以如來命文殊於異方、召維摩於他土，爰集毘耶，共弘斯道。	001	Nevertheless, sentient beings have long been asleep, and without words they cannot be awakened. The Way is not self-propagating, its propagation depends on people. Therefore, the Tathāgata commanded Mañjuśrī from a different land and summoned Vimalakīrti from another country. They gathered in Vimalakīrti's room and together propagated this Way.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b01_1']	此經所明，統萬行則以權智為主、樹德本則以六度為根、濟蒙惑則以慈悲為首、語宗極則以不二為門。	此經所明，統萬行則以權智為主、樹德本則以六度為根、濟蒙惑則以慈悲為首、語宗極則以不二為門。	001	The sutra clarifies that, in unifying myriad practices, skillful wisdom is the main principle; in establishing the foundation of virtue, the six perfections are the root; in rescuing the ignorant and deluded, compassion is the foremost; in speaking of the ultimate, non-duality is the gateway.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b01_14']	凡此眾說，皆不思議之本也；	凡此眾說，皆不思議之本也；	001	All these teachings are the basis of the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b03_4']	至若借座燈王、請飯香土、手接大千、室包乾象，不思議之迹也。	至若借座燈王、請飯香土、手接大千、室包乾象，不思議之迹也。	001	As for borrowing the seat from the Lamp King, inviting food from the fragrant land, receiving the great trichiliocosm with the hand, and the room containing the images of the universe, these are the traces of the inconceivable.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b03_15']	然幽關難啟，聖應不同。	然幽關難啟，聖應不同。	001	However, the profound gate is difficult to open, and the sage's response is not the same.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b05_13']	非本無以垂跡、非跡無以顯本，本跡雖殊而不思議一也，故命侍者標以為名焉。	非本無以垂跡、非跡無以顯本，本跡雖殊而不思議一也，故命侍者標以為名焉。	001	Without the basis, there would be no manifestation of traces; without the traces, there would be no revelation of the basis. Although the basis and traces are different, they are not separate in the inconceivable. Therefore, the attendant was ordered to name it.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b08_1']	大秦天王俊神超世、玄心獨悟，弘至治於萬機之上、揚道化於千載之下，每尋翫茲典，以為棲神之宅；	大秦天王俊神超世、玄心獨悟，弘至治於萬機之上、揚道化於千載之下，每尋翫茲典，以為棲神之宅；	001	The King of the Great Qin Dynasty, with his outstanding spirit surpassing the world and profound mind uniquely enlightened, propagated the supreme governance above the myriad affairs and elevated the Way's transformation below the thousand years. He always studied and enjoyed this canon, regarding it as the abode for the mind to dwell.

['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b09_14']	北天之運，運通有在也。	北天之運，運通有在也。	001	The operation of the Northern Heaven, the operation of communication, has its existence.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b12_7']	以弘始八年歲次鶉火，一命大將軍常山公右將軍安成侯與義學沙門千二百人，於長安大寺請羅什法師重譯正本。	以弘始八年歲次鶉火，一命大將軍常山公右將軍安成侯與義學沙門千二百人，於長安大寺請羅什法師重譯正本。	001	In the eighth year of Hongshi, in the year of Chunhuo, he ordered the Great General Changshan Gong, the Right General Ancheng Hou, and 1,200 monks who studied the meaning of the scriptures, to invite Master Kumarajiva to retranslate the correct text at a large temple in Chang'an.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b16_3']	什以高世之量冥心真境，既盡環中又善方言，時手執梵文口自宣譯，道俗虔虔一言三復，陶冶精求務存聖意，其文約而詣、其旨婉而彰，微遠之言於茲顯然矣。	什以高世之量冥心真境，既盡環中又善方言，時手執梵文口自宣譯，道俗虔虔一言三復，陶冶精求務存聖意，其文約而詣、其旨婉而彰，微遠之言於茲顯然矣。	001	Kumarajiva, with his lofty mind, contemplated the true realm. Having exhausted the center, he was also good at languages. At that time, he held the Sanskrit text in his hand and translated it himself. The monks and laypeople were pious, repeating each word three times. They refined and sought, focusing on the holy meaning. The text was concise yet effective, and the meaning was subtle yet clear. The subtle and distant words became evident here.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b18_16']	余以闇短時預聽次，雖思乏參玄，然麁得文意，輒順所聞為之注解，略記成言述而無作，庶將來君子異世同聞焉。	余以闇短時預聽次，雖思乏參玄，然麁得文意，輒順所聞為之注解，略記成言述而無作，庶將來君子異世同聞焉。	001	I, being ignorant and short-sighted, was in the listening group at that time. Although I thoughtlessly participated in the profound, I roughly understood the meaning of the text. I immediately followed what I heard and annotated it, briefly recording the completed words as a record without creation, hoping that gentlemen of the future, hearing it in a different world, would be the same.

['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b23_3']	從妙喜國來遊此境，所應既周將還本土，欲顯其淳德以澤群生，顯迹悟時要必有由，故命同志詣佛而獨不行。	從妙喜國來遊此境，所應既周將還本土，欲顯其淳德以澤群生，顯迹悟時要必有由，故命同志詣佛而獨不行。	001	He came from the Land of Wonderful Joy to visit this realm, and after his duties were completed, he was about to return to his homeland. He wanted to manifest his pure virtue and benefit sentient beings. Manifesting his traces and awakening the times must have a reason, so he ordered his companions to visit the Buddha but did not go himself.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b23_13']	獨不行則，知其疾也。	獨不行則，知其疾也。	001	Not going himself, it is known that he was ill.

['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327b28_8']	然則此經始終所由，良有在也。	然則此經始終所由，良有在也。	001	Thus, the reason for the beginning and end of this sūtra truly lies in this.
['ZH_T38_1775_001:0327c01_7']	若自說而觀則眾聖齊功、自本而尋則功由淨名，源其所由，故曰維摩詰所說也。	若自說而觀則眾聖齊功、自本而尋則功由淨名，源其所由，故曰維摩詰所說也。	001	If one observes from one's own explanation, then the myriad sages have equal merit. If one seeks from the basis, then the merit is due to Vimalakīrti. Tracing its source, it is called Spoken by Vimalakīrti.

He manifests in this Saha world from the wonderful joy of the Pure Land. The reason for harmonizing with the dust and mundane world and using the path to teach the Dharma is that he always travels with Ratnasaṃbhava, as a companion in the Dharma city.

This is why he initiated the topic of inquiring about illness and established the beginning of subtle words. The wonderful singing came from there, so it speaks of his teachings.
