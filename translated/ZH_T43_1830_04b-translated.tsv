['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0376c21_16']	謂彼頌說恒轉如流。	謂彼頌說恒轉如流。	04b	That is, the verse says it constantly transforms like a stream.

The answer is that this is the intention of the author of the treatise and should not be questioned. Or it is a method of ellipsis.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0376c25_8']	謂初能變但釋所緣。	謂初能變但釋所緣。	04b	That is to say, the first transformation only explains the objects.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0376c25_17']	故前頌言執受處是。	故前頌言執受處是。	04b	Therefore the previous verse says perceptions and locations.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0376c26_8']	第三能變唯釋所依。	第三能變唯釋所依。	04b	The third transformation only explains the basis.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0376c26_17']	故後頌言依止本識。	故後頌言依止本識。	04b	Therefore the later verse says dependent on the fundamental consciousness.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0376c27_8']	第二能變依．緣俱顯。	第二能變依．緣俱顯。	04b	The second transformation shows both the basis and the conditions.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0376c28_12']	欲令學者可知一隅三隅返故　或謂本識諸法之本。	欲令學者可知一隅三隅返故　或謂本識諸法之本。	04b	It is in order to make the learner know one corner and the other three corners will be reversed. Or it is said that the fundamental consciousness is the basis of all dharmas.

['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a01_18']	故下論云。	故下論云。	04b	Therefore the treatise below says:
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a02_6']	此所緣．及別依。	此所緣．及別依。	04b	These objects and specific bases,
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a02_16']	麁顯．極成故此不說。	麁顯．極成故此不說。	04b	because they are coarse, obvious, and well-known, are not explained here.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a03_3']	第七依．緣俱隱。	第七依．緣俱隱。	04b	The seventh consciousness has both basis and conditions hidden.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a03_9']	根．境合釋。	根．境合釋。	04b	The faculties and objects are explained together.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a03_18']	所以作論三種不同。	所以作論三種不同。	04b	This is why the treatise is composed with three different explanations.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a05_15']	非但說所緣而無依等　何故本識不出界繫　論主略故　或言異熟即是界繫。	非但說所緣而無依等　何故本識不出界繫　論主略故　或言異熟即是界繫。	04b	Not only is the object of perception said to be without support, etc. Why does the root consciousness not fall into the realms? The author of the treatise is concise. Or it is said that the karmic retribution itself is falling into the realms.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a06_4']	隨何界異熟。	隨何界異熟。	04b	According to which realm the karmic retribution is in,
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a06_15']	即彼界繫故　此亦應然。	即彼界繫故　此亦應然。	04b	it is bound to that realm. Therefore this is also so.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a07_11']	言染俱已即隨彼繫　此不為例。	言染俱已即隨彼繫　此不為例。	04b	It is said that when it is defiled, it is bound according to that. This is not an analogy.
['ZH_T43_1830_04b:0377a08_7']	謂前六識起與本識非必同繫。	謂前六識起與本識非必同繫。	04b	It means that when the first six consciousnesses arise, they are not necessarily the same as the root consciousness in falling into the realms.
