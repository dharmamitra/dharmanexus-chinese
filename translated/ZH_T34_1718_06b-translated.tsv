['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0082b05_2']	以此善根能扣佛慈悲，故言「遇到父舍」。	以此善根能扣佛慈悲，故言「遇到父舍」。	06b	Using these wholesome roots, one can knock on the Buddha's compassionate means, thus it is said arriving at the father's house.

Because there is the great capacity, it is said seeing the father from afar, and because there is the small capacity, it is said staying by the side of the gate.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0082b09_2']	若唯小無大則應不見尊特之身，父不應言「我財物庫藏今有所付」；	若唯小無大則應不見尊特之身，父不應言「我財物庫藏今有所付」；	06b	If there were only the small and no large, then one would not see the majestic body, and the father should not say, I now entrust my wealth and property.

The two contemplations as skillful means are the two sides of the gate. The audience with perfect capacity is directly seen at the gate. The two vehicles' biased truth is called the side of the gate. The samādhi of mere emptiness and the biased wisdom-eye of the truth only glimpse the Dharma body.

The elder who is compared, the attendants and guards, the kshatriyas and brahmins who respectfully surround him, all point to the retinue in the Flower Ornament Sutra, all without difference. The characteristics of the Dharma that is expounded, as clarified in that sutra, are also without distinction.

This is exploring the Buddha's intention. Although the Buddha's encouragement method did not resonate with the audience, his intention was still not to stop. He further used the admonition method to try to reach them. Only then did he stop the manifestation of the Dharma, as he had no choice.

Wisdom is the sender, and the teachings are what is sent. The principle is the main point, while the teachings are secondary. From the Buddha, the twelve divisions of the Mahayana teachings emerged, intended for sentient beings, but those without the capacity to receive them did not accept them. This is like milk, hence it says sent a messenger.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0083c08_5']	又傍人者，傍臣佐等也，即是遣法身菩薩為說大乘，如《華嚴》中令四菩薩說四十地，即是遣傍人也。	又傍人者，傍臣佐等也，即是遣法身菩薩為說大乘，如《華嚴》中令四菩薩說四十地，即是遣傍人也。	06b	Moreover, a messenger refers to a minister or aide, which means sending Dharma-body Bodhisattvas to expound the Mahayana teachings. In the Flower Ornament Sutra, it is said that the four Bodhisattvas expound the forty stages, which is also like sending a messenger.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0083c10_3']	「疾走往捉」者，大乘明義顯露正直，用此赴機疾趣菩提，故大車中云其疾如風；	「疾走往捉」者，大乘明義顯露正直，用此赴機疾趣菩提，故大車中云其疾如風；	06b	Run quickly to catch him means that the teaching of the Mahayana is revealed and straightforward, using this to quickly reach enlightenment in accordance with the capacity of beings, so it is said in the great vehicle that it is as fast as the wind;

Suddenly hearing the great teaching, it goes against his mind, so he is frightened, and not recognizing it, he is startled.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0083c16_8']	「稱怨大喚」者，小乘以煩惱為怨、生死為苦，若勸煩惱即菩提，即大喚稱怨枉，若聞生死即涅槃，即大喚稱苦痛。	「稱怨大喚」者，小乘以煩惱為怨、生死為苦，若勸煩惱即菩提，即大喚稱怨枉，若聞生死即涅槃，即大喚稱苦痛。	06b	He cried out in resentment means that the Hinayana takes afflictions as resentment and birth and death as suffering. If one exhorts afflictions to be enlightenment, then he cries out in resentment and injustice. If he hears that birth and death is nirvana, then he cries out in great pain.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0083c16_17']	無機不受，勸門也。	無機不受，勸門也。	06b	Without capacity, he does not accept the exhortative teaching.

Because sentient beings have crimes, they enter the prison of birth and death. Bodhisattvas also enter the prison with the same crime. Those of the two vehicles lack great compassion, which is called having no crime.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0083c26_18']	令入生死，即是而被囚執也，無大方便而入生死，必當永失三乘慧命，故言必死。	令入生死，即是而被囚執也，無大方便而入生死，必當永失三乘慧命，故言必死。	06b	Causing them to enter birth and death is being imprisoned. Lacking great skillful means and entering birth and death, one will certainly forever lose the wisdom life of the three vehicles, thus it is said certain death.

In the Vimalakīrti Sutra, it says, Subdue your bodily fragrance so as not to cause those sentient beings to give rise to deluded attachment.

Therefore, it is said that for this reason, for twenty years he is always made to remove excrement.

Once familiar with the family business and fully understanding it, one then accomplishes great aspirations. Because the will is unobstructed, one can be entrusted with the family business. Because of being entrusted with the family business, one is then delighted. Because there is near and far, if one is not first taught to work for wages and given a day's pay, how can one mutually trust and entrust the business and hand over the wealth?

First, sending a bystander, what the bystander says is likened to the perfect and sudden teaching of the Flower Ornament Sutra. This teaching is the earliest. The bystander is likened to the ox, what is said is likened to milk. Internally, it corresponds to the twelve divisions of the canon coming from the Buddha. This is the first flavor. This is used to match the people of the two vehicles. Without the capacity, they do not accept it and are confused and fall to the ground. In their entirety, it is like the milk flavor.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0086b18_15']	次明密遣二人說除糞法，此譬息大之後鹿苑說三，於小即信革凡成聖，如轉乳為酪，內合從十二部出修多羅，即第二味也。	次明密遣二人說除糞法，此譬息大之後鹿苑說三，於小即信革凡成聖，如轉乳為酪，內合從十二部出修多羅，即第二味也。	06b	Next, it clarifies secretly sending two people to speak the method of removing excrement. This metaphor is after ceasing the great, speaking the three in the Deer Park. In the small, they immediately believe and transform from ordinary to sage, like turning milk into yogurt. Internally, it corresponds to the sutras coming from the twelve divisions. This is the second flavor.

The Two Vehicles do not slander when hearing the Great Vehicle, and do not regress when the Lesser Vehicle is disparaged. This is because those who have severed the bonds in the Tripiṭaka take the daily wage and can endure the praise and disparagement. If one has not yet severed the bonds, one cannot hear the praise of the Great Vehicle, like before not accepting the encouragement. One also cannot hear the disparagement of the Lesser Vehicle, like before not accepting the admonition. But now, not slandering and not regressing, is because of mutual trust in the mental state.

Since one has obtained the wage of nirvāṇa, one can endure the disparagement without anger. Although it is not one's own matter, one does not doubt or slander it. This mental state is mature, like curds coming from milk, which is the third taste coming from the sūtras, corresponding to the Vaipulya sūtras.
['ZH_T34_1718_06b:0086c05_6']	次明「長者自知將死不久」下，譬方等心相體信入出無難已後委以家業，使其領教為大菩薩說摩訶般若，既領知眾物貫統法門，心明口辯彌益慕樂，但恨住小非是己分，脫更開許豈不樂哉，於是心漸通泰成就大志，如似生蘇出於熟蘇，是從方等出摩訶般若，第四味也。	次明「長者自知將死不久」下，譬方等心相體信入出無難已後委以家業，使其領教為大菩薩說摩訶般若，既領知眾物貫統法門，心明口辯彌益慕樂，但恨住小非是己分，脫更開許豈不樂哉，於是心漸通泰成就大志，如似生蘇出於熟蘇，是從方等出摩訶般若，第四味也。	06b	Next, from the elder knowing that his death is near, the analogy of the Vaipulya teachings is given. The elder's mind is like the father's trust in his son, entering and leaving without difficulty, and then entrusting him with the family business. He has the great bodhisattvas expound the Mahāprajñāpāramitā. Having understood the various objects and mastered the Dharma gates, his mind is clear, his speech is eloquent, and his admiration and delight increase. He only regrets that the Hīnayāna is not his own share. If he were to open it up again, how could he not be delighted? Thus his mind gradually becomes open and at ease, accomplishing the great aspiration, like raw ghee coming from ripe ghee. This is the fourth flavor, coming from the Vaipulya teachings and into the Mahāprajñāpāramitā.

The Buddha's knowledge and insight is revealed, the true nature is shown, the bodhisattvas' doubts are removed, and the shravakas become buddhas. All are liberated through the Tathagata's nirvana, like going from ripe ghee to the best ghee. This comes from mahayana prajna and enters great nirvana, which is the fifth flavor.

They still remained in the state of arhats and did not say that in the future they would attain Buddhahood. This refers to the teaching of raw curd in the Great Collection and Vimalakīrti sūtras. From at that time the elder became ill, the second is entrusting the family business, which refers to the teaching of ripe curd in the Great Prajñāpāramitā sūtra where the Buddha ordered them to turn the teachings and cultivate prajñā.
