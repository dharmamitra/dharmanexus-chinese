['ZH_T41_1822_016:0666a15_11']	緣假有情非名色等　麁惡語但緣有情發語。	緣假有情非名色等　麁惡語但緣有情發語。	It takes sentient beings as its object, not name-and-form, etc. Harsh speech only takes sentient beings as its object in order to express words.

['ZH_T41_1822_016:0666a19_16']	即是於他眾具起他物想　邪行謂於妻．妾等。	即是於他眾具起他物想　邪行謂於妻．妾等。	This is the property of others. Wrong sexual activity means even with one's wife or concubines,
['ZH_T41_1822_016:0666a20_11']	亦是眾具　貪謂他物屬己想。	亦是眾具　貪謂他物屬己想。	it is also a property. Covetousness means the property of others is thought to belong to oneself.

['ZH_T41_1822_016:0666a21_15']	故三業道眾具處起　邪見業道撥無因果。	故三業道眾具處起　邪見業道撥無因果。	Therefore, the three karmic paths arise in the realm of property. The karmic path of wrong view denies cause and effect.

['ZH_T41_1822_016:0666a24_12']	故言名身等處起。	故言名身等處起。	Therefore, it is said to arise in the realm of the collection of names, etc.
