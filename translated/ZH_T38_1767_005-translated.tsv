The exhortation also includes the previous two exhortations and the two reprimands.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063b17_12']	此領前合譬中似解之意，故言因緣。	此領前合譬中似解之意，故言因緣。	This includes the meaning of the apparent understanding in the previous combined parable, so it is called causes and conditions.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063b18_14']	能知如來是常住法者，此領前合譬中分真之解。	能知如來是常住法者，此領前合譬中分真之解。	Being able to know that the Tathagata is the Dharma of permanence includes the understanding of the true aspect in the previous combined parable.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063b19_8']	善覆如來，此領後合譬似解也。	善覆如來，此領後合譬似解也。	Well-covering the Tathagata includes the apparent understanding in the later combined parable.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063b21_3']	若領真似二解，即是兼領六位之意。	若領真似二解，即是兼領六位之意。	If one understands both the true and provisional interpretations, then one also understands the meaning of the six stages.

Mañjuśrī did not argue at all, but instead praised him. This is because what Cunda said accords with the teachings and the capacities of the audience.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063b25_14']	聖人但說己法不說他法，驗知純陀是分真位，是故文殊還以分真美其言行，即是發純陀五戒之迹顯分真之本。	聖人但說己法不說他法，驗知純陀是分真位，是故文殊還以分真美其言行，即是發純陀五戒之迹顯分真之本。	The sages only speak their own Dharma and do not speak the Dharma of others. Examining this, we know that Cunda is in the stage of partial truth. Therefore, Mañjuśrī uses partial truth to praise his words and actions, which reveals Cunda's traces of the five precepts and manifests his foundation of partial truth.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063b28_14']	言時會者，乃是新眾。	言時會者，乃是新眾。	As for the assembly at that time, it refers to the new assembly.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c01_5']	一代教門彈斥洮汰已會毫善，豈執如來定入涅槃同於初小？	一代教門彈斥洮汰已會毫善，豈執如來定入涅槃同於初小？	The teachings of the Buddha have already been used to criticize and refine away all subtle faults. How can you insist that the Tathāgata definitely enters nirvāṇa, the same as in the beginning when he was still a small child?
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c02_12']	正為未來鈍根小習而執於小，故《法華》云「除佛滅後」。	正為未來鈍根小習而執於小，故《法華》云「除佛滅後」。	It is precisely for the sake of future dull faculties and those with small practices that they cling to the small. Therefore, the Lotus Sūtra says, Except after the Buddha's extinction.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c05_8']	若不爾者，豈有如前幢旛妙供人天雜類菩薩聲聞皆默不受，而於城中工巧微供彰言納受，因茲普領時會之供，復能難佛為佛所歎？	若不爾者，豈有如前幢旛妙供人天雜類菩薩聲聞皆默不受，而於城中工巧微供彰言納受，因茲普領時會之供，復能難佛為佛所歎？	If it were not so, how could there be such as before, with the wonderful offerings of banners and flags, humans, gods, various kinds of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas all silently not accepting, while in the city, with the small offerings of craftsmanship, expressing acceptance, and from this universally receiving the offerings of the assembly, and also being able to challenge the Buddha and be praised by the Buddha?
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c06_7']	又與文殊旁論往復，故知純陀非聊爾人。	又與文殊旁論往復，故知純陀非聊爾人。	Moreover, together with Mañjuśrī, they discuss back and forth. Therefore, know that Cunda is not an ordinary person.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c10_12']	雖終日說有不能盡其用，終日說無不能罄其極，言所不洎，絕而置之。	雖終日說有不能盡其用，終日說無不能罄其極，言所不洎，絕而置之。	Although one speaks of existence all day long, one cannot exhaust its function; although one speaks of nonexistence all day long, one cannot reach its ultimate. Words cannot describe it, so it is set aside.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c11_6']	又言置者，指廣置略，即世界置。	又言置者，指廣置略，即世界置。	Moreover, set aside means to set aside the brief for the extensive, which is the world.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c11_21']	涅槃正體，非體非用、非為無為。	涅槃正體，非體非用、非為無為。	The true essence of nirvana is neither essence nor function, neither conditioned nor unconditioned.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c15_14']	有為無為乃是旁論，今此正以獻供為宗，置旁復宗，故言且置，即為人置。	有為無為乃是旁論，今此正以獻供為宗，置旁復宗，故言且置，即為人置。	The conditioned and unconditioned are secondary discussions. The main point here is to offer the food. Setting aside the secondary and returning to the main point is called setting aside for now, which is the meaning of set aside for the individual.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c16_8']	次從「汝可隨時」去，是復宗論。	次從「汝可隨時」去，是復宗論。	Next, from You may offer it at any time is the discussion of returning to the main point.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c21_12']	勸時者，如初行時、初到時、病時、物新熟時，今最後供，是初去時。	勸時者，如初行時、初到時、病時、物新熟時，今最後供，是初去時。	Encouraging in a timely manner means like when first setting out, when first arriving, when sick, when things are newly ripe. Now the final offering is at the time of first departure.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c22_11']	二勸速者，古佛道法過中不食，今速赴此時。	二勸速者，古佛道法過中不食，今速赴此時。	Second, encouraging speed means that the ancient Buddha's way is not to eat after noon, so now quickly attend to this time.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c23_6']	三勸奉佛者，正為最後供佛涅槃。	三勸奉佛者，正為最後供佛涅槃。	Third, encouraging to serve the Buddha means precisely to make the final offering to the Buddha's nirvana.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c26_8']	非時索施，理涉於貪。	非時索施，理涉於貪。	Asking for a non-timely offering involves greed in principle.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0063c28_10']	三不知佛者，汝謂如來實須食耶？	三不知佛者，汝謂如來實須食耶？	Third, not knowing the Buddha means do you think the Tathagata really needs to eat?
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a01_1']	文殊同他見謂須雜食，純陀申已解食即不食，故訶文殊墮三不知。	文殊同他見謂須雜食，純陀申已解食即不食，故訶文殊墮三不知。	Manjushri shares the view of others, thinking he needs to eat ordinary food, while Cunda expresses his understanding that eating is not eating, so he rebukes Manjushri for falling into the three kinds of unknowing.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a01_19']	次「爾時佛告」去，如來印讚成前起後。	次「爾時佛告」去，如來印讚成前起後。	Next, from at that time the Buddha told... the Tathagata affirms and praises to complete the previous and initiate the next.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a04_19']	一偏慶悅可、二破偏悅可、三並悅可、四解悅可、五寂絕悅可。	一偏慶悅可、二破偏悅可、三並悅可、四解悅可、五寂絕悅可。	First, partial celebration and approval, second, refuting partial approval, third, approval in both aspects, fourth, approval through understanding, fifth, approval through complete detachment.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a09_11']	三、文殊作兩番關並先定之，若定悅可一切眾生，我說有為亦應悅可；	三、文殊作兩番關並先定之，若定悅可一切眾生，我說有為亦應悅可；	Third, Mañjuśrī sets up two rounds of arguments, first determining [the issue], saying, If it is determined to delight all sentient beings, then my talk of the conditioned should also delight [the Buddha].
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a11_3']	若不悅我圓悅，則破一切之義，是則不成還是偏悅，成佛愛憎，即作伏並。	若不悅我圓悅，則破一切之義，是則不成還是偏悅，成佛愛憎，即作伏並。	If it does not delight my perfect [view], then the meaning of 'all' is refuted, and it is still not perfect, but biased delight, which would mean the Buddha has love and hatred, and so [Mañjuśrī] sets up a counter-argument.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a11_17']	四、純陀覺其伏並，還解兩關：	四、純陀覺其伏並，還解兩關：	Fourth, Cunda realizes [Mañjuśrī's] counter-argument and resolves two issues:
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a12_9']	一無偏染悅可、二有普淨悅可。	一無偏染悅可、二有普淨悅可。	First, there is no biased, tainted delight; second, there is universal, pure delight.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a15_5']	次從「等視一切」去，明有普淨悅可，即是如來境界，非我爾所知云云。	次從「等視一切」去，明有普淨悅可，即是如來境界，非我爾所知云云。	Next, from viewing all equally, it clarifies the universally pure delight and approval, which is the realm of the Tathāgata, not what I know.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a16_4']	五、從「國王」去，明寂絕悅可，不應作偏普籌量。	五、從「國王」去，明寂絕悅可，不應作偏普籌量。	Fifth, from king onward, it clarifies the delight and approval of tranquility and cessation, which should not be unilaterally measured.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a17_7']	上文殊明有為無為且共置之，即是絕言不可說悅。	上文殊明有為無為且共置之，即是絕言不可說悅。	In the above, Mañjuśrī clarifies that conditioned and unconditioned are for now to be set aside, which is the delight that cannot be spoken of through cessation of words.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a18_14']	此中意明有悅無悅是佛境界，不可籌量，即是絕思悅可。	此中意明有悅無悅是佛境界，不可籌量，即是絕思悅可。	The meaning here clarifies that delight and non-delight are the realm of the Buddha, which cannot be measured, which is the delight and approval of cessation of thought.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a19_3']	初譬分智不及究竟。	初譬分智不及究竟。	First, the analogy clarifies that the wisdom of distinction does not reach the ultimate.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a20_2']	王家駕駟譬究竟智，群下驢乘譬分真智。	王家駕駟譬究竟智，群下驢乘譬分真智。	The royal family's four-horse chariot is an analogy for ultimate wisdom, while the commoners' donkey cart is an analogy for the wisdom of distinction.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a20_11']	後譬分斷不及究竟。	後譬分斷不及究竟。	Later, the analogy clarifies that the severing of distinctions does not reach the ultimate.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a21_10']	龜龍在水喻有無明，菩薩行故見不了了。	龜龍在水喻有無明，菩薩行故見不了了。	The tortoise and dragon in the water are metaphors for the presence of ignorance, because the bodhisattva practices and sees unclearly.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a22_8']	金翅騰空譬無明盡，佛不行故見則了了。	金翅騰空譬無明盡，佛不行故見則了了。	The garuḍa soaring in the sky is a metaphor for the exhaustion of ignorance, because the Buddha does not practice and sees clearly.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a23_6']	前是下不知上，後是上能知下。	前是下不知上，後是上能知下。	The former is the lower not knowing the higher, while the latter is the higher being able to know the lower.

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a24_15']	靈味云：	靈味云：	Lingwei says:

['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a26_9']	讚純陀之說，故言如是如是。	讚純陀之說，故言如是如是。	Praising Cunda's statement, thus saying it is so, it is so.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a27_6']	其既高推佛境不可度量，是故讚美。	其既高推佛境不可度量，是故讚美。	Since he highly pushes the Buddha's realm as immeasurable, therefore he praises and admires it.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a27_17']	發者，拂我執一塗之義。	發者，拂我執一塗之義。	Elucidation means brushing aside the meaning of a single path of self-attachment.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a28_14']	因汝試我，試則非實，故言有為非有為。	因汝試我，試則非實，故言有為非有為。	Because you test me, testing is not real, thus saying conditioned is not conditioned.
['ZH_T38_1767_005:0064a29_6']	汝推未詳，故言無為非無為。	汝推未詳，故言無為非無為。	You push without fully understanding, thus saying unconditioned is not unconditioned.
