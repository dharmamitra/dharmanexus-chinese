Therefore, the Bodhisattva Grounds Sutra says, Bodhisattvas on the tenth ground perceive the reflected images of conditioned objects, like a person with clear eyes looking through a light veil.

['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993b25_32']	故《法花》云「假使滿世間，皆如舍利弗，盡思共度量，不能知佛智。	故《法花》云「假使滿世間，皆如舍利弗，盡思共度量，不能知佛智。	01a	Therefore, the Lotus Sutra says, Even if the world were filled with Shariputra-like ones, using their utmost thought to measure together, they would not be able to know the Buddha's wisdom.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993b25_44']	」下文未知，中人亦未了。	」下文未知，中人亦未了。	01a	The text below is still unknown, and the average person is also not yet clear.

He transforms the two vehicles and ordinary beings, using the wondrous functions of the transformation body to accord with the capacities of beings and manifest realization. He manifests a wondrous and great body to transform the bodhisattvas of the ten grounds, using the wondrous functions of the body of enjoyment for others.

['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c02_1']	故下經云「眾會瞻仰大牟尼，靡不心生清淨信，各見世尊在其前，斯則如來不共相。	故下經云「眾會瞻仰大牟尼，靡不心生清淨信，各見世尊在其前，斯則如來不共相。	01a	Therefore, the sutra below says, The assembly looks up to the Great Sage, and none do not give rise to pure faith. Each sees the World-Honored One before them. This is the unique characteristic of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c03_19']	」身既無異、隨宜說三，法亦無差、住機成四，如如意珠隨求雨寶、猶天帝鼓應念發聲。	」身既無異、隨宜說三，法亦無差、住機成四，如如意珠隨求雨寶、猶天帝鼓應念發聲。	01a	Since the body is no different, the three are taught according to suitability. The Dharma is also without distinction, and according to the capacities of beings, it becomes four. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel that rains treasures according to one's wishes, or like the heavenly emperor's drum that emits sounds in response to thoughts.

['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c06_13']	隨理所修，因之為行。	隨理所修，因之為行。	01a	In accordance with the principle, what is cultivated is called practice.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c07_2']	因修所證，號之為果。	因修所證，號之為果。	01a	What is realized through cultivation is called the fruition.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c08_2']	然此四種各自無二，任緣有異並通三乘。	然此四種各自無二，任緣有異並通三乘。	01a	However, these four each have their own non-duality, and there are differences based on conditions. They are all common to the three vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c10_1']	故下經言「佛以一音演說法，眾生各各隨所解，普得受用獲其利，斯即如來不共相。	故下經言「佛以一音演說法，眾生各各隨所解，普得受用獲其利，斯即如來不共相。	01a	Therefore, the sutra below says, The Buddha expounds the Dharma with one voice, and sentient beings each understand according to their own way. They all obtain benefit and gain its advantage. This is the uncommon characteristic of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c12_9']	」此乃教一任緣通三，亦即《法花》一雨普潤三乘三草，二聖二木生長不同，此乃教同而機有異，成三乘法。	」此乃教一任緣通三，亦即《法花》一雨普潤三乘三草，二聖二木生長不同，此乃教同而機有異，成三乘法。	01a	This means that the teaching is one, and the conditions allow for the commonality of the three vehicles. It is also the one rain of the Lotus Sutra that universally moistens the three vehicles and the three types of grass and two types of trees grow differently. This means that the teaching is the same, but the capacities are different, forming the Dharma of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c14_6']	此經又云「佛以一音演說法，或有恐畏或歡喜，或生厭離或斷疑，斯則如來不共相。	此經又云「佛以一音演說法，或有恐畏或歡喜，或生厭離或斷疑，斯則如來不共相。	01a	This sutra also says, The Buddha expounds the Dharma with one voice, and some are fearful, some are joyful, some give rise to disgust, and some resolve their doubts. This is the uncommon characteristic of the Tathagata.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c14_16']	」此亦理一任緣通三。	」此亦理一任緣通三。	01a	This is also reasonable, allowing the conditions to be common to the three.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c15_14']	《寶性論》之河性無差，兔馬象三渡之有別。	《寶性論》之河性無差，兔馬象三渡之有別。	01a	In the Treasure Nature Treatise, the nature of the river is undifferentiated, but the crossing of the rabbit, horse, and elephant is distinct.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c16_9']	此乃理同而證有異，成三乘義。	此乃理同而證有異，成三乘義。	01a	This is the same principle but with different realizations, establishing the meaning of the three vehicles.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c18_2']	《法花經》中，衣裓机案，唯有一門，出處雖殊，離諸災難，及取牛車之因是等。	《法花經》中，衣裓机案，唯有一門，出處雖殊，離諸災難，及取牛車之因是等。	01a	In the Lotus Sutra, the lap robe, table, and chair are only one gate. Although the places of exit are different, they are free from all calamities and take the cause of the ox cart.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c19_18']	《勝鬘》又言「正法住、正法滅、波羅提木叉、毘尼、出家、受具足，此六法為大乘。	《勝鬘》又言「正法住、正法滅、波羅提木叉、毘尼、出家、受具足，此六法為大乘。	01a	The Śrīmālā-sūtra also says, The abiding of the true Dharma, the extinction of the true Dharma, the Prātimokṣa, the Vinaya, going forth, and receiving the full precepts - these six dharmas are for the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:0993c20_14']	」故諸經論二藏，善蓋名住、除障名滅。	」故諸經論二藏，善蓋名住、除障名滅。	01a	Therefore, in the sūtras and treatises, the two piṭakas are called abiding and extinction respectively.

['ZH_T38_1782_01a:1002c11_14']	」說觀法身如來等品。	」說觀法身如來等品。	01a	It explains the chapter on contemplating the Tathāgata's Dharma body and so forth.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:1002c12_19']	後因鶖子請問，方說淨名從阿閦佛國來，不唯明阿閦佛。	後因鶖子請問，方說淨名從阿閦佛國來，不唯明阿閦佛。	01a	Later, due to Śāriputra's inquiry, it explains how Vimalakīrti came from Akṣobhya Buddha's land, not only clarifying Akṣobhya Buddha.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:1002c14_2']	今唯言阿閦佛，失彼品經宗之意，何但違於梵音。	今唯言阿閦佛，失彼品經宗之意，何但違於梵音。	01a	Now, only mentioning Akṣobhya Buddha loses the main purport of that chapter's sūtra. How is it not just contrary to the Sanskrit?
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:1002c15_6']	但以方言隔正理虧，義既乖其本宗，名亦如何不謬也。	但以方言隔正理虧，義既乖其本宗，名亦如何不謬也。	01a	It is only because the spoken language differs that the correct principle is flawed. Since the meaning deviates from its original purport, how can the name also not be mistaken?

Since it describes the causes for arising, the first part is called the introduction.

['ZH_T38_1782_01a:1002c22_18']	經旨既深，恐不能傳習，讚過去藥王如來等事，勸授末代，故後二品名流通分。	經旨既深，恐不能傳習，讚過去藥王如來等事，勸授末代，故後二品名流通分。	01a	Since the purport of the sūtra is profound, it may not be able to be transmitted and practiced. Praising the past events of the Medicine King Tathāgata and others encourages transmission to future generations, so the last two chapters are called the transmission.
['ZH_T38_1782_01a:1002c23_9']	緣起分中，四種圓滿：	緣起分中，四種圓滿：	01a	Within the causes and conditions, there are four kinds of perfection:

The Buddha said that the two benefits are the cause for adornment and purification.
