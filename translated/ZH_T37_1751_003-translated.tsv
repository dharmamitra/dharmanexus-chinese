['ZH_T37_1751_003:0208c12_16']	是故解釋通別二名，無不義具教行理三。	是故解釋通別二名，無不義具教行理三。	003	Therefore, explaining the general and specific two names, none of them do not have the meaning of the three of teaching, practice, and principle.
['ZH_T37_1751_003:0208c15_7']	能說之佛既具三身，所說觀境各具於三，故云釋名總於三法，體章別在法身，宗用別當餘二，教相一章分別總別。	能說之佛既具三身，所說觀境各具於三，故云釋名總於三法，體章別在法身，宗用別當餘二，教相一章分別總別。	003	Since the Buddha who can speak already possesses the three bodies, the contemplated objects that are spoken each possess the three. Therefore, it is said that explaining the name is general to the three dharmas, the chapter on essence is specifically about the Dharma body, the purport and function are specifically about the other two, and the chapter on teaching characteristics distinguishes the general and specific.

The provisional and middle are all empty, therefore the three belong to the purport. The middle and emptiness are all provisional, therefore the three belong to the function.

Therefore, from the Distinct Teaching down to the dharmas of the six destinies, all have the aspects of subject, object, mind, etc., and what Māra can speak of is all called demonic matters.

The mind is easy to understand in terms of possessing, while form is difficult to comprehend. Therefore, the Mohe Zhiguan says, The cause is easy to recognize, but the effect is difficult to know. Therefore, whether contemplating oneself or others, one cultivates the contemplation of the mind.
['ZH_T37_1751_003:0210b13_7']	今觀淨土須求於心，心能具故、心能造故，心垢土垢、心淨土淨，此猶通示，未是的論。	今觀淨土須求於心，心能具故、心能造故，心垢土垢、心淨土淨，此猶通示，未是的論。	003	Now, contemplating the Pure Land requires seeking in the mind, because the mind can possess and the mind can create. When the mind is defiled, the land is defiled; when the mind is pure, the land is pure. This is still a general indication, not the definitive discussion.

In the conclusion of the essence, it says the wondrous contemplation of cultivating the mind can elicit the Pure Land.

The response to the defiled through the contemplation of analysis is found in the Tripiṭaka teachings. The response to the pure through the contemplation of essence is not exclusive to the teachings of the Shared and Distinct. The three teachings of the Shared, Distinct, and Perfect in the teachings of the Mahāyāna, in contrast to the contemplation of analysis in the Tripiṭaka teachings, all clarify the contemplation of the essence of dharmas. The Shared teaching only contemplates emptiness, the Distinct teaching contemplates in sequence, and the Perfect teaching contemplates without sequence. The three types of people, when born there, all respond to the pure characteristics.
['ZH_T37_1751_003:0210c03_15']	圓人最淨如《觀音疏》，別向圓修，圓七信去，見彼依正同於實報，住行及通見相俱劣。	圓人最淨如《觀音疏》，別向圓修，圓七信去，見彼依正同於實報，住行及通見相俱劣。	003	The people of the Perfect teaching are the purest, as explained in the commentary on the Guan Wuliangshoufo jing. Those of the Distinct teaching who practice towards the Perfect, from the seventh stage of faith onwards, see the dependent and the principal to be the same as in the Reward of the Real. Those of the stages of Abiding and Practice, as well as those of the Shared teaching, see the characteristics to be inferior.
['ZH_T37_1751_003:0210c06_4']	今經妙體須異三人，故同居有餘所明淨相，文通意別，須以前後頓觀之文、妙宗之語，解此通文令歸的趣。	今經妙體須異三人，故同居有餘所明淨相，文通意別，須以前後頓觀之文、妙宗之語，解此通文令歸的趣。	003	The wondrous essence of this sutra must be different from that of the three types of people. Therefore, the pure characteristics explained in the Shared and Distinct teachings are general in text but specific in meaning. One must use the texts of the sudden contemplation before and after, as well as the words of the Wondrous Summit, to understand this general text and return to the specific purport.

The three ranks of sages and ten stages of saints borrow the names of the separate teaching, while the stage of fruition and reward is named the stage of the perfect teaching.
['ZH_T37_1751_003:0211a28_1']	三賢既與十聖同住果報，驗是實報。	三賢既與十聖同住果報，驗是實報。	003	Since the three ranks of sages are the same as the ten stages of saints in abiding in the fruition and reward, this verifies that it is the reward of reality.

If a person abandons their body and falls into that realm, they become the same as those ghosts, not shared by others.

When it comes to the Lotus Sūtra, Kāśyapa recounts hearing about the bodhisattvas' Dharma and playing with spiritual powers in the past, and does not give rise to a single thought of delight.

Permanence and self are the Dharma body, bliss is liberation, and purity is prajñā.
