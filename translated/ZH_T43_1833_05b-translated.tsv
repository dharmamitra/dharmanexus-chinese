['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c04_3']	一顯後非。	一顯後非。	First, it reveals the later as not correct.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c06_7']	除既一品明無九類　二明後是。	除既一品明無九類　二明後是。	Second, it clarifies the later as correct.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c07_3']	如上界惑體雖無記得有九品。	如上界惑體雖無記得有九品。	Like the afflictions of the upper realms, although the substance is neutral, there are nine grades.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c09_12']	無有染污至方自在故者。	無有染污至方自在故者。	Because there is no defiled attachment, up to the mastery of the realm.

The question is: After attaining the fundamental meditative absorption, do the defilements of the preliminary stage actually arise or not? There are two interpretations.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c16_2']	云下地諸法若生上地不現在前　答異地不爾。	云下地諸法若生上地不現在前　答異地不爾。	The first interpretation allows for their arising. If so, why does the Abhidharma-kośa say: The dharmas of the lower stages, if born in the upper stages, do not appear? The answer is: The different stages are not so.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c16_7']	同地容起。	同地容起。	The same stage may give rise to them.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c16_16']	未至亦是初禪攝故。	未至亦是初禪攝故。	Because the preliminary stage is also included in the first meditative absorption.🔽Moreover, there is no contradiction in the body of the lower stage attaining the fundamental first [meditative absorption] and giving rise to the defilements of the preliminary stage.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c18_3']	又下地身得初根本起未至惑亦復無違　二不得起。	又下地身得初根本起未至惑亦復無違　二不得起。	The second interpretation is that they cannot arise.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c18_8']	無所須故。	無所須故。	Because there is no need for them.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c20_11']	得勝捨劣故　若爾畢竟無有起義何用有為　答如三無色得有見道無漏第八餘九地有。	得勝捨劣故　若爾畢竟無有起義何用有為　答如三無色得有見道無漏第八餘九地有。	Because one obtains the superior and abandons the inferior. If so, there is ultimately no arising. What is the use of having conditioned factors? Answer: Just as the three formless realms can have the path of seeing and the eighth consciousness without outflows, and the remaining nine realms have it.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0922c21_3']	雖無起義地法得有。	雖無起義地法得有。	Although there is no arising, the attainment of the realms and factors exists.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0923a17_4']	故知世道不能伏彼迷理所引所有事惑。	故知世道不能伏彼迷理所引所有事惑。	Therefore, it is known that the worldly path cannot subdue the manifest afflictions of the realm of form and formless realm that are attracted by delusion of the principle.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0923a24_4']	由道劣故不能斷修。	由道劣故不能斷修。	Because the path is inferior, they are unable to eliminate the passions that are eliminated by cultivation.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0923a26_14']	次第不還能依未至斷修惑故。	次第不還能依未至斷修惑故。	Because those who gradually eliminate passions can still rely on the preliminary stage to eliminate the passions that are eliminated by cultivation.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926b28_18']	所言蓋者按對法第七云。	所言蓋者按對法第七云。	As for the hindrances, according to the seventh chapter of the Abhidharma-samuccaya,
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926b29_11']	能令善品不得顯了是蓋義。	能令善品不得顯了是蓋義。	they are able to prevent wholesome states from becoming manifest, this is the meaning of hindrance.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c03_1']	覆蔽其心障諸善品令不轉故　問於何等位障諸善法　答於樂出家位．覺正行位．止舉捨位。	覆蔽其心障諸善品令不轉故　問於何等位障諸善法　答於樂出家位．覺正行位．止舉捨位。	They cover and obscure the mind, obstructing wholesome states and preventing their occurrence. As for in what states they obstruct wholesome dharmas, the answer is: in the state of delighting in leaving the home life, in the state of realizing right practice, and in the state of quiescence, exertion, and equanimity.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c03_13']	謂於樂出家時貪欲蓋為障。	謂於樂出家時貪欲蓋為障。	That is to say, when delighting in leaving the home life, the hindrance of greed is an obstruction.

The hindrances of lethargy, sleep, agitation, and remorse obstruct both the states of calming and uplifting.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c08_6']	如前所說能引沈沒及散亂故。	如前所說能引沈沒及散亂故。	As explained above, they lead to sinking and distraction.

The explanation in the commentary is slightly different in words but the meaning is the same as this. Question: What is the meaning of combining the four hindrances of lethargy, etc. into two?
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c11_11']	遠離決定不能捨故　疏中所辨言中少別意同於此　問惛沈等四合為二蓋其意云何　答惛沈．睡眠行相相似。	遠離決定不能捨故　疏中所辨言中少別意同於此　問惛沈等四合為二蓋其意云何　答惛沈．睡眠行相相似。	Answer: The modes of activity of lethargy and sleep are similar.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c12_17']	故瑜伽論第十一云。	故瑜伽論第十一云。	Therefore the eleventh chapter of the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says:
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c13_7']	無堪任性名惛沈。	無堪任性名惛沈。	Lack of adaptability is called lethargy.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c13_17']	惛昧心極略性名睡眠。	惛昧心極略性名睡眠。	Dullness and extreme contraction of the mind is called sleep.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c14_11']	由此惛沈生諸煩惱隨煩惱時。	由此惛沈生諸煩惱隨煩惱時。	Because of this, when lethargy generates the afflictions and secondary afflictions,

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c18_5']	掉舉．惡作俱因親屬尋思國等昔所經事而起之也。	掉舉．惡作俱因親屬尋思國等昔所經事而起之也。	Agitation and remorse both arise from thinking about relatives, one's country, and past events.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c18_10']	故總結云。	故總結云。	Therefore, it concludes:
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0926c19_9']	由前掉舉與此惡作處所等故合說一蓋。	由前掉舉與此惡作處所等故合說一蓋。	Because the location of agitation is the same as that of remorse, they are combined to form one hindrance.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b15_17']	由有尋有伺諸識種子隨逐無尋無伺三摩地故。	由有尋有伺諸識種子隨逐無尋無伺三摩地故。	Because the seeds of consciousness with applied thought and sustained thought follow the samādhi without applied thought and sustained thought,
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b16_8']	從彼起已此得現前。	從彼起已此得現前。	after arising from it, this [samādhi] can manifest.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b16_17']	又此起已識現行時。	又此起已識現行時。	Moreover, when this [samādhi] arises and the manifest activity of consciousness occurs,
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b17_14']	復為無尋無伺三摩地種子之所隨逐。	復為無尋無伺三摩地種子之所隨逐。	it is again followed by the seeds of the samādhi without applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b18_9']	是故此地非是一向無尋無伺。	是故此地非是一向無尋無伺。	Therefore, this stage is not unilaterally without applied thought and sustained thought.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b19_9']	由彼有情於諸尋．伺以性離欲而離欲故。	由彼有情於諸尋．伺以性離欲而離欲故。	Because those beings are detached from applied thought and sustained thought through the detachment of the nature [of the samādhi].
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b20_1']	彼地雖名無尋無伺。	彼地雖名無尋無伺。	Although that ground is called without applied thought and without sustained thought,

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b22_12']	雖無自性至亦有尋伺者。	雖無自性至亦有尋伺者。	Although they do not have their own nature of applied thought and sustained thought,

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b24_2']	然對法論說彼自性即是有相。	然對法論說彼自性即是有相。	the Abhidharma-samuccaya says that their own nature is precisely having characteristics.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b24_12']	有相瑜伽說是尋．伺。	有相瑜伽說是尋．伺。	Having characteristics is said by the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra to be applied thought and sustained thought.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b26_7']	顯多由彼起。	顯多由彼起。	It is evident that they arise mostly due to that.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b26_12']	疏有二解。	疏有二解。	There are two explanations in the commentary.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b27_2']	有義彈彼第二解云。	有義彈彼第二解云。	There is an interpretation that criticizes the second explanation, saying:
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b28_2']	疏說生上必尋．伺引方能起下眼等識者。	疏說生上必尋．伺引方能起下眼等識者。	The commentary says that when one is born in a higher realm, they must be drawn by applied thought and sustained thought in order to be able to produce the eye consciousness and so forth of a lower realm.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b28_12']	豈起五識要下意引生。	豈起五識要下意引生。	How can it be that in order to produce the five consciousnesses, they must be drawn by the manas of a lower realm?
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927b29_6']	在下地尚用上定能引五識。	在下地尚用上定能引五識。	Even while in a lower realm, one can use the samādhi of a higher realm to draw the five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c01_2']	如何生上要起下界尋．伺識引。	如何生上要起下界尋．伺識引。	How, when born in a higher realm, must one draw on the consciousnesses of applied thought and sustained thought of a lower realm?
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c01_7']	未必盡理。	未必盡理。	This is not necessarily the complete principle.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c02_6']	然將起上諸地意識能引下眼識等為勝。	然將起上諸地意識能引下眼識等為勝。	However, when about to generate the mental consciousness of the higher stages, it can attract the eye consciousness, etc. of the lower stages as superior.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c03_7']	如大菩薩豈不能以上諸地心引下五識起。	如大菩薩豈不能以上諸地心引下五識起。	How could a great bodhisattva not be able to attract the five consciousnesses of the lower stages with the mind of the higher stages?
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c04_9']	故五十六云從無尋伺三摩地起已此得現前。	故五十六云從無尋伺三摩地起已此得現前。	Therefore, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra says, “After arising from the samādhi of no-thought, this [mental consciousness] appears.”
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c05_1']	不言更起下地心故。	不言更起下地心故。	It does not say that one generates the mind of a lower stage again.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c05_11']	此論且依前後引生說。	此論且依前後引生說。	This treatise only relies on attraction in sequence to explain.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c06_1']	從定起此得現前。	從定起此得現前。	After arising from samādhi, this [mental consciousness] appears.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c07_1']	理實八地已去菩薩於諸地心具五識故。	理實八地已去菩薩於諸地心具五識故。	In reality, bodhisattvas from the eighth stage and above possess the five consciousnesses of all stages.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c07_17']	故多由言亦在生上而起下者　詳曰。	故多由言亦在生上而起下者　詳曰。	Therefore, the word “mostly” also includes those who generate [the five consciousnesses] while in the upper stages.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c08_8']	若許上意引下眼等。	若許上意引下眼等。	If it is allowed that the mental consciousness of the upper stages attracts the eye consciousness, etc. of the lower stages,
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c08_18']	二定上意尋．伺不有。	二定上意尋．伺不有。	then the mental consciousness of the two samādhis of no-thought and no discrimination does not have applied thought and sustained thought.

['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c10_4']	又五十六不云出定更起下心。	又五十六不云出定更起下心。	Moreover, the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra does not say that after arising from samādhi one generates the mind of a lower stage again.
['ZH_T43_1833_05b:0927c10_13']	便證上心引下識者。	便證上心引下識者。	How can this be taken as evidence that the mind of the upper stages attracts the consciousnesses of the lower stages?
