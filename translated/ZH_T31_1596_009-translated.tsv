['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c18_10']	於方便無分別智中有三種，謂因緣、引攝、數習等出生差別故。	於方便無分別智中有三種，謂因緣、引攝、數習等出生差別故。	Within the expedient non-discriminating cognition, there are three kinds, namely, the distinctions of arising from causes and conditions, attraction, and frequent practice.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c19_16']	無分別智亦有三種，謂知足、不顛倒、無戲論等無分別故。	無分別智亦有三種，謂知足、不顛倒、無戲論等無分別故。	Non-discriminating cognition is also of three kinds, namely, non-discrimination due to contentment, non-inversion, and non-playfulness.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c21_5']	無分別後得智有五種，謂通達、憶念、成立、和合、如意等顯示差別。	無分別後得智有五種，謂通達、憶念、成立、和合、如意等顯示差別。	The subsequently attained cognition of non-discrimination is of five kinds, namely, the distinctions of manifestation through realization, recollection, establishment, combination, and as one wishes.

['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c23_13']	因緣引攝數習等出生差別故者，此是方便無分別三種，由或以種性力、或以現前數習力故得生。	因緣引攝數習等出生差別故者，此是方便無分別三種，由或以種性力、或以現前數習力故得生。	Arising from causes and conditions, attraction, and frequent practice, etc. This refers to the three kinds of expedient non-discrimination, which arise either by the power of the spiritual lineage or by the power of frequent practice in the present.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c24_8']	於中種性力者，即是從因得生。	於中種性力者，即是從因得生。	Among them, the power of the spiritual lineage is precisely the arising from causes.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c25_8']	數習力者，即是現在身丈夫力作，非從因生。	數習力者，即是現在身丈夫力作，非從因生。	The power of repeated practice refers to the power of the present body and manliness, which is not produced from causes.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c28_1']	知足無顛倒不戲論無分別故者，於中知足無分別者，應知是聞思體究竟，由滿足故、不復分別故，名知足無分別。	知足無顛倒不戲論無分別故者，於中知足無分別者，應知是聞思體究竟，由滿足故、不復分別故，名知足無分別。	Because of contentment, absence of delusion, non-disputation, and non-discrimination, among them, the absence of discrimination due to contentment should be known as the culmination of the essence of hearing and contemplation, because of being satisfied and no longer discriminating, it is called the absence of discrimination due to contentment.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0309c29_14']	於聞思位究竟時，自知得到究竟處，此菩薩住在凡夫地生滿足心，作是念：	於聞思位究竟時，自知得到究竟處，此菩薩住在凡夫地生滿足心，作是念：	When reaching the culmination of the stages of hearing and contemplation, one knows for oneself that one has reached the ultimate point. This bodhisattva abides in the stage of ordinary beings and gives rise to a mind of satisfaction, thinking:
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a01_4']	聞思事只齊於此。	聞思事只齊於此。	The matters of hearing and contemplation end here.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a01_17']	以是義故，說為知足無分別。	以是義故，說為知足無分別。	For this reason, it is called the absence of discrimination due to contentment.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a04_2']	復次應知有世間知足無分別，若得於有頂處見為涅槃，生知足心，謂更無餘處，故名知足無分別。	復次應知有世間知足無分別，若得於有頂處見為涅槃，生知足心，謂更無餘處，故名知足無分別。	Moreover, it should be known that there is a worldly absence of discrimination due to contentment. If one attains the view of the peak of existence as nirvāṇa and gives rise to a mind of contentment, thinking there are no other places, it is called the absence of discrimination due to contentment.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a06_11']	不顛倒無分別者，應知是聲聞等，由諸聲聞通達真實故，得無常等四無倒智，於常等四倒相中不復顛倒分別。	不顛倒無分別者，應知是聲聞等，由諸聲聞通達真實故，得無常等四無倒智，於常等四倒相中不復顛倒分別。	As for the absence of inverted discrimination, one should know that this refers to the śrāvakas and others, because the śrāvakas realize the truth and thus attain the four kinds of non-inverted cognition such as impermanence, and no longer discriminate in an inverted manner regarding the four inversions such as permanence.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a08_16']	無戲論無分別者，應知是諸菩薩，由諸菩薩知一切法乃至菩提，無戲論、無分別，故不復分別。	無戲論無分別者，應知是諸菩薩，由諸菩薩知一切法乃至菩提，無戲論、無分別，故不復分別。	As for the absence of conceptual proliferation and discrimination, one should know that this refers to the bodhisattvas, because the bodhisattvas know that all dharmas up to enlightenment are free from conceptual proliferation and discrimination, and thus no longer discriminate.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a10_7']	無戲論者，謂出語言道過世間智，由此智非言語所說亦非世智所知故。	無戲論者，謂出語言道過世間智，由此智非言語所說亦非世智所知故。	As for being free from conceptual proliferation, this refers to transcending the path of language and surpassing worldly cognition, because this cognition is not expressed by language nor known by worldly cognition.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a14_2']	復次無分別後得智有五種差別應知，謂通達、憶念、成立、和合、如意等顯示差別故者，於中通達顯示、憶念顯示、成立顯示、和合顯示、如意顯示等五種差別。	復次無分別後得智有五種差別應知，謂通達、憶念、成立、和合、如意等顯示差別故者，於中通達顯示、憶念顯示、成立顯示、和合顯示、如意顯示等五種差別。	Furthermore, it should be known that the subsequently attained cognition free from discrimination has five kinds of distinctions, namely, the distinctions of realization, recollection, establishment, unification, and displaying as one wishes, etc. Among them, there are five kinds of distinctions: the distinction of realization, the distinction of recollection, the distinction of establishment, the distinction of unification, and the distinction of displaying as one wishes, etc.

['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a16_18']	憶念顯示者，若出定已，憶念言：	憶念顯示者，若出定已，憶念言：	The manifestation of recollection means that, having emerged from concentration, one recollects and says:
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a17_6']	我已通達無分別也。	我已通達無分別也。	I have already penetrated non-discrimination.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a18_2']	成立顯示者，如所通達，為他解說。	成立顯示者，如所通達，為他解說。	The manifestation of establishment means explaining to others what has been penetrated.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a19_12']	和合顯示者，以一切法為一摶相總相攀緣智，由此觀智即得轉依。	和合顯示者，以一切法為一摶相總相攀緣智，由此觀智即得轉依。	The manifestation of unification means the wisdom that takes all dharmas as a single lump and general characteristic as its object. By this insight wisdom, one attains the transformation of the basis.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a21_3']	如意顯示者，由此轉依故即得如意顯示，由隨心所念一切自在。	如意顯示者，由此轉依故即得如意顯示，由隨心所念一切自在。	The manifestation of wish means that by this transformation of the basis, one attains the manifestation of wish, because of mastery over all mental intentions.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a23_1']	由此自在，若以地等為金等即得成就，由顯示故，為此如意故顯示故，名如意顯示。	由此自在，若以地等為金等即得成就，由顯示故，為此如意故顯示故，名如意顯示。	By this mastery, if one takes earth, etc. as gold, etc., one attains accomplishment, because of manifestation, because of manifesting for this wish, it is called the manifestation of wish.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a23_5']	何以故？	何以故？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a23_9']	由經說：	由經說：	Because it is said in the sutra:
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310a23_17']	以顯示及如意故。	以顯示及如意故。	In order to demonstrate and accord with one's wishes.

['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b10_9']	此中鬼畜人天等各隨其所應者，畜生以為水，餓鬼為高原；	此中鬼畜人天等各隨其所應者，畜生以為水，餓鬼為高原；	Among them, animals think of water, hungry ghosts think of high plateaus;
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b11_6']	如人見糞為穢，猪等畜生見為淨妙；	如人見糞為穢，猪等畜生見為淨妙；	Just as humans see feces as filthy, animals see it as pure and wonderful;
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b12_3']	如人見飲食為淨，於諸天見為不淨。	如人見飲食為淨，於諸天見為不淨。	Just as humans see food and drink as pure, gods see it as impure.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b13_14']	以此道理，顯示於一物中各隨其意見有差別，是故應知義無所有故。	以此道理，顯示於一物中各隨其意見有差別，是故應知義無所有故。	Using this principle, it shows that in one thing, each person's opinion is different. Therefore, one should know that meanings do not exist.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b15_1']	彼等所取既不成就，若爾義無所有故，識應不緣境而生。	彼等所取既不成就，若爾義無所有故，識應不緣境而生。	Since what they grasp is not established, if so, because meanings do not exist, consciousness should not arise without an object.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b17_1']	答亦有識不緣境而生，如夢及過去未來等無實攀緣，即自體攀緣，如鏡像及定境亦爾。	答亦有識不緣境而生，如夢及過去未來等無實攀緣，即自體攀緣，如鏡像及定境亦爾。	The answer is: There is also consciousness that arises without an object, such as dreams and the past, future, etc. without real objects, it takes itself as its object, like reflections in a mirror and objects in meditation.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b18_13']	次以偈顯示過去等及夢，此偈者於中後半偈釋前半偈，如其次第應知。	次以偈顯示過去等及夢，此偈者於中後半偈釋前半偈，如其次第應知。	Next, it is shown by verse in the past, etc., and dreams. In this verse, the latter half explains the former half. It should be known in sequence.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b21_5']	由無實攀緣故無攀緣，非無攀緣即自攀緣故，謂自心為境而攀緣故，即是過去未來及夢并二影像等次第相應。	由無實攀緣故無攀緣，非無攀緣即自攀緣故，謂自心為境而攀緣故，即是過去未來及夢并二影像等次第相應。	Because there is no real object of cognition, there is no object of cognition. It is not that there is no object of cognition, but rather that it is the object of cognition itself. That is to say, because the mind itself is the object and is cognized, it is the sequence of the past, future, and dreams, as well as the two images, etc.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b22_10']	若義成為境無無分別智者，若義有自性則無無分別智。	若義成為境無無分別智者，若義有自性則無無分別智。	If the meaning becomes the object, there is no non-discriminating cognition. If the meaning has self-nature, then there is no non-discriminating cognition.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b23_17']	若汝言無無分別智有何失者，此智若不有，佛果無可得。	若汝言無無分別智有何失者，此智若不有，佛果無可得。	If you say that there is no non-discriminating cognition, what is the loss? If this cognition does not exist, the fruit of Buddhahood cannot be attained.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b25_2']	若無分別智不有則不能得佛果，是故決定應有應知。	若無分別智不有則不能得佛果，是故決定應有應知。	If non-discriminating cognition does not exist, then the fruit of Buddhahood cannot be attained. Therefore, it must definitely exist and be known.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b27_14']	得自在菩薩者，謂已得自在力故勝解自在故者，得樂欲自在故如念地等成者，謂欲以地等諸物成金等相即能成故。	得自在菩薩者，謂已得自在力故勝解自在故者，得樂欲自在故如念地等成者，謂欲以地等諸物成金等相即能成故。	The bodhisattvas who have attained mastery refer to those who have already attained the power of mastery and the mastery of resolve. Because they can transform earth and so forth according to their thoughts, that is, if they wish to transform earth and other things into gold and other forms, they can do so.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b28_14']	得定者亦爾者，謂得定人及餘聲聞等故。	得定者亦爾者，謂得定人及餘聲聞等故。	Those who have attained concentration are also like this, referring to those who have attained concentration and other śrāvakas and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310b29_11']	成就觀行人者，謂成就毘鉢舍那故。	成就觀行人者，謂成就毘鉢舍那故。	Those who have accomplished the practice of contemplation refer to those who have accomplished vipaśyanā.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c01_1']	智人者，即是諸菩薩。	智人者，即是諸菩薩。	The wise ones are precisely the bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c01_13']	得寂靜者，謂得三摩提故。	得寂靜者，謂得三摩提故。	Those who have attained tranquility refer to those who have attained samādhi.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c05_5']	思惟一切法如其義顯現者，由諸菩薩於如是如是修多羅等法義思念時如念顯現，若念佛時隨所思念，於彼彼法中佛義顯現，如是色受等義顯現亦爾故。	思惟一切法如其義顯現者，由諸菩薩於如是如是修多羅等法義思念時如念顯現，若念佛時隨所思念，於彼彼法中佛義顯現，如是色受等義顯現亦爾故。	Contemplating all dharmas as their meanings manifest as they are means that when bodhisattvas contemplate the meanings of the dharmas such as the sūtras in this way and as they are, they manifest as they are contemplated. If they contemplate the Buddha, then as they contemplate him, the meaning of the Buddha manifests in those various dharmas. The manifestation of the meanings of form, feeling, and so forth is also like this.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c07_1']	智行無分別一切義不現者，智正行無分別時，由一切義不現故，即知義無有。	智行無分別一切義不現者，智正行無分別時，由一切義不現故，即知義無有。	When the correct practice of wisdom is without discrimination, because all meanings do not appear, one knows that meanings do not exist.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c07_15']	由義無所有故，識亦成無所有。	由義無所有故，識亦成無所有。	Because meanings do not exist, consciousness also becomes nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c08_6']	此識無所有，今當顯示。	此識無所有，今當顯示。	The nonexistence of this consciousness will now be demonstrated.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c09_12']	識亦不得有者，所識既不有，能識則不成，是故應知無所有。	識亦不得有者，所識既不有，能識則不成，是故應知無所有。	Consciousness also cannot exist. Since the cognized does not exist, the cognizing is not established. Therefore, one should know that it does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c10_4']	此義應知相中已具解釋。	此義應知相中已具解釋。	This meaning should be understood as already explained in the characteristics section.

['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c14_2']	云何不住相應而得滿足？	云何不住相應而得滿足？	How does one attain fulfillment through being in accord with non-abiding?
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c18_5']	謂遠離五種住處故，一遠離外道我執處故、二遠離不見真實菩薩分別處故、三遠離生死涅槃二邊處故、四遠離唯斷煩惱障生知足處故、五遠離捨眾生利益事住無餘涅槃界處故。	謂遠離五種住處故，一遠離外道我執處故、二遠離不見真實菩薩分別處故、三遠離生死涅槃二邊處故、四遠離唯斷煩惱障生知足處故、五遠離捨眾生利益事住無餘涅槃界處故。	It is said that because it is far removed from five kinds of abodes: first, because it is far removed from the abode of the self-attachment of non-Buddhists; second, because it is far removed from the discrimination of bodhisattvas who have not yet seen the truth; third, because it is far removed from the two extremes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa; fourth, because it is far removed from the abode of being content with merely eliminating the afflictive hindrances; fifth, because it is far removed from the abode of abandoning the task of benefiting sentient beings and abiding in the realm of nirvāṇa without remainder.

['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c20_9']	由經說住般若波羅蜜中已，與不住相應，如是等。	由經說住般若波羅蜜中已，與不住相應，如是等。	Because the sūtra says that having already abided in the perfection of wisdom, one accords with non-abiding, and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c21_17']	為欲令知此義故，以經文顯示如是住不住相應中滿足餘波羅蜜。	為欲令知此義故，以經文顯示如是住不住相應中滿足餘波羅蜜。	In order to make one understand this meaning, the sūtra text displays how, within this non-abiding accord with abiding, the other perfections are fulfilled.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c23_4']	遠離外道我執處者，如外道住般若中有我執，念云：	遠離外道我執處者，如外道住般若中有我執，念云：	As for far removed from the abode of the self-attachment of non-Buddhists, it is like how non-Buddhists, abiding in the perfection of wisdom, have self-attachment, thinking:
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c23_15']	我住般若中，此是般若。	我住般若中，此是般若。	I abide in the perfection of wisdom, this is the perfection of wisdom.
['ZH_T31_1596_009:0310c24_17']	菩薩遠離如是外道住相故，得住無住相應般若中。	菩薩遠離如是外道住相故，得住無住相應般若中。	Because bodhisattvas are far removed from such external views and dwelling in characteristics, they are able to abide in the non-abiding corresponding to prajñā.
