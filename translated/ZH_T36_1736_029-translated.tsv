['ZH_T36_1736_029:0218a11_12']	今體即如，如外無苦，何所捨耶？	今體即如，如外無苦，何所捨耶？	029	Now, the essence is thusness, and outside of thusness there is no suffering, so what is there to abandon?
['ZH_T36_1736_029:0218a12_1']	此句言如，如尚似空；	此句言如，如尚似空；	029	This sentence mentions thusness, and thusness is still similar to emptiness;

['ZH_T36_1736_029:0218b15_5']	故上疏云「而文義包博言含性相」，相即生滅及與無量，性即無生及與無作。	故上疏云「而文義包博言含性相」，相即生滅及與無量，性即無生及與無作。	029	Therefore, the commentary above says: But the text and meaning are vast, and the words contain nature and characteristics. Characteristics refer to arising and ceasing, as well as the immeasurable, while nature refers to non-arising and non-action.
['ZH_T36_1736_029:0218b16_5']	相以廣狹成二四諦，性以空實成二四諦。	相以廣狹成二四諦，性以空實成二四諦。	029	Characteristics form two sets of four truths based on vastness and narrowness, while nature forms two sets of four truths based on emptiness and reality.
['ZH_T36_1736_029:0218b18_12']	經宗必融，舉一收四方是經旨，以四種四諦義出諸師，故疏闇用使合經文，不標名目，恐驚常聽。	經宗必融，舉一收四方是經旨，以四種四諦義出諸師，故疏闇用使合經文，不標名目，恐驚常聽。	029	The essence of the sutra must be fused. Raising one to encompass the four directions is the purport of the sutra. The meaning of the four kinds of four truths comes from various masters. Therefore, the commentary uses them in obscurity to match the sutra text, without listing the names, fearing it would startle the usual listeners.
['ZH_T36_1736_029:0218b19_17']	結歸二對順常經論，或名有作無作、或名有量無量。	結歸二對順常經論，或名有作無作、或名有量無量。	029	It concludes by returning to the two pairs, following the usual sutras and treatises, which are sometimes called with-outflows and without-outflows, or sometimes called with-measure and without-measure.

Now the truth of cessation is the principle, and the twelve links of dependent origination are called extensive phenomena but brief.
