In the fifth ground, the counteraction to the conceit of discriminating the purity of the body has already been explained. Now, in the sixth ground, the counteraction to the conceit of discriminating the defiled and pure dharmas is explained, because of the ten equal dharmas.

['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b04_16']	是菩薩觀世間生滅已，作是念：	是菩薩觀世間生滅已，作是念：	008	This bodhisattva, observing the arising and ceasing of the world, thinks like this:
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b06_7']	世間所有受身生處差別，皆以貪著我故，若離著我則無世間生處。	世間所有受身生處差別，皆以貪著我故，若離著我則無世間生處。	008	The various places where beings take birth in the world are all due to attachment to the self. If one is free from attachment to the self, there are no worldly places of birth.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b06_14']	菩薩復作是念：	菩薩復作是念：	008	The bodhisattva further thinks:
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b10_2']	此諸凡夫愚癡所盲貪著於我，無智闇障常求有無，恒隨邪念妄行邪道，集起妄行，罪行、福行、不動行，以是行故起心種子，有漏有取想故。	此諸凡夫愚癡所盲貪著於我，無智闇障常求有無，恒隨邪念妄行邪道，集起妄行，罪行、福行、不動行，以是行故起心種子，有漏有取想故。	008	These ordinary beings are blinded by ignorance and attached to the self. Lacking wisdom, they are always obscured, constantly seeking existence and non-existence, always following wrong thoughts and mistakenly practicing wrong paths. They give rise to false practices, sinful practices, meritorious practices, and immovable practices. Due to these practices, they give rise to the seeds of the mind. Because of contaminated and grasping thoughts,
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b12_8']	起未來生老死身，復生後有，業為地、無明覆蔽、愛水為潤、我心溉灌、種種見網令得增長，生名色牙。	起未來生老死身，復生後有，業為地、無明覆蔽、愛水為潤、我心溉灌、種種見網令得增長，生名色牙。	008	They give rise to future birth, old age, death, and the body. They further give rise to future existence. Karma is the ground, ignorance covers and obscures, the water of craving moistens, the mind of self-grasping irrigates, and the various nets of views cause it to grow. The sprout of name-and-form is born.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b15_11']	生已增長，名色增長已成諸根，諸根成已迭互相對生觸，觸相對生受，受後所悕生愛，以有愛故生取，取增長已生有，有成已生五陰身。	生已增長，名色增長已成諸根，諸根成已迭互相對生觸，觸相對生受，受後所悕生愛，以有愛故生取，取增長已生有，有成已生五陰身。	008	After birth, there is growth. Name-and-form grows and the faculties are formed. When the faculties are formed, they interact and give rise to contact. Contact gives rise to feeling. After feeling, there is craving. Because of craving, grasping arises. Grasping increases and gives rise to becoming. Becoming forms and gives rise to the five aggregates.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b17_1']	五陰身增長已，於五道中漸漸衰變名為老，衰老變滅名為死。	五陰身增長已，於五道中漸漸衰變名為老，衰老變滅名為死。	008	The five aggregates grow and gradually decay in the five destinies, which is called aging. The transformation and cessation of aging is called death.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b18_3']	死後生諸熱惱，因熱惱故生一切憂悲苦惱聚。	死後生諸熱惱，因熱惱故生一切憂悲苦惱聚。	008	After death, there arises distress. Because of distress, all the aggregates of sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and distress arise.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b19_7']	是因緣集，無有集者自然而集，無有滅者自然而滅。	是因緣集，無有集者自然而集，無有滅者自然而滅。	008	This is the collection of causes and conditions. There is no collector, yet it collects by itself. There is no cessation, yet it ceases by itself.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b20_2']	是菩薩如是隨順觀因緣集。	是菩薩如是隨順觀因緣集。	008	The bodhisattva contemplates the collection of causes and conditions in this way.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b21_2']	論曰：	論曰：	008	The treatise says:
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b22_16']	是中世間所有受身生處差別者，五道中所有生死差別，是名世間所有差別。	是中世間所有受身生處差別者，五道中所有生死差別，是名世間所有差別。	008	Herein, the various differences in the places where one receives a body and is born in the world refer to the differences in birth and death in the five destinies. This is called the various differences in the world.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b23_9']	此因緣集有三種觀門應知：	此因緣集有三種觀門應知：	008	This collection of causes and conditions should be known to have three aspects of contemplation:

['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b24_19']	云何成差別？	云何成差別？	008	What are the distinctions in accomplishment?
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b27_10']	初明唯因緣集，釋無我義，成一切世間所有受身生處皆以貪著我故，若離著我則無世間生處，即無我義成。	初明唯因緣集，釋無我義，成一切世間所有受身生處皆以貪著我故，若離著我則無世間生處，即無我義成。	008	First, it clarifies that it is only the accumulation of causes and conditions, explaining the meaning of no-self, and accomplishing that all the bodies and places of rebirth in the world are due to attachment to self. If one is free from attachment to self, then there are no places of rebirth in the world, and the meaning of no-self is accomplished.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168b29_6']	若第一義中實有我相者，著我之心即是第一義智，不應在世間受身生處生。	若第一義中實有我相者，著我之心即是第一義智，不應在世間受身生處生。	008	If in ultimate truth there really were characteristics of self, then the mind attached to self would be the wisdom of ultimate truth, and one should not be reborn in the world to receive a body and be born in a place.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c01_12']	又復若第一義中實有我相者，若離著我則應常生世間。	又復若第一義中實有我相者，若離著我則應常生世間。	008	Moreover, if in ultimate truth there really were characteristics of self, then if one were free from attachment to self, one should always be reborn in the world.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c03_14']	顯示此義，如經「世間所有受身生處差別，皆以貪著我故，若離著我則無世間生處」故。	顯示此義，如經「世間所有受身生處差別，皆以貪著我故，若離著我則無世間生處」故。	008	To reveal this meaning, it is as the sūtra says: The distinctions in the bodies and places of rebirth in the world are all due to attachment to self. If one is free from attachment to self, then there are no places of rebirth in the world.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c04_1']	云何答差別？	云何答差別？	008	What are the distinctions in the answer?
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c04_11']	若實無我，云何著我？	若實無我，云何著我？	008	If there really is no self, how can one be attached to self?
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c04_18']	此中應有是難。	此中應有是難。	008	Here there should be a question.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c05_12']	即自答言，愚癡所盲貪著於我。	即自答言，愚癡所盲貪著於我。	008	He himself answers, blinded by ignorance, attached to the self.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c06_5']	此示現，如經「菩薩復作是念：	此示現，如經「菩薩復作是念：	008	This is shown, as the sutra says, The bodhisattva further thinks:

['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c08_8']	如是實無有我，有何次第貪著於我，得有世間受身生處？	如是實無有我，有何次第貪著於我，得有世間受身生處？	008	Thus, there is no self, so what sequence is there in being attached to the self, and how can there be worldly rebirth?
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c09_15']	成此示現，如經「無智闇障常求有無」故，如是答難差別。	成此示現，如經「無智闇障常求有無」故，如是答難差別。	008	This is shown, as the sutra says, Without the light of wisdom, always seeking existence and non-existence. The answer to this question is distinguished in this way.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c12_8']	是中無智有無者悕求常斷，此示無明、有愛是二有支根本故，恒隨邪念妄行邪道，集起妄行罪行福行不動行。	是中無智有無者悕求常斷，此示無明、有愛是二有支根本故，恒隨邪念妄行邪道，集起妄行罪行福行不動行。	008	Here, the ignorance of existence refers to the desire for permanence and annihilation. This shows that ignorance and craving for existence are the fundamental causes of the two branches of existence. One always follows wrong thoughts and mistakenly practices the wrong path, accumulating false practices, sinful practices, meritorious practices, and immovable practices.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c13_2']	恒隨邪念者，示無明因故。	恒隨邪念者，示無明因故。	008	Always following wrong thoughts shows the cause of ignorance.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c13_18']	妄行邪道者，示於解脫處不正行故。	妄行邪道者，示於解脫處不正行故。	008	Mistakenly practicing the wrong path shows the incorrect practice in the place of liberation.
['ZH_T26_1522_008:0168c15_5']	集起妄行者，示菩薩勝義故，菩薩雖行於有不名妄行。	集起妄行者，示菩薩勝義故，菩薩雖行於有不名妄行。	008	Accumulation of false practices shows the supreme meaning for bodhisattvas, because although bodhisattvas practice existence, it is not called false practice.
