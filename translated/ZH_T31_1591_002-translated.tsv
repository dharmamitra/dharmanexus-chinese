['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081b24_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081b25_5']	復言處時定如夢者，謂如諸覺雖無其境共許有定。	復言處時定如夢者，謂如諸覺雖無其境共許有定。	As for saying that place and time are definite like in a dream, it means that even though there is no object, it is commonly accepted that there is definiteness.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081b26_13']	若時決定而有方處，見村園等復有定時現前可得，然非彼有。	若時決定而有方處，見村園等復有定時現前可得，然非彼有。	If there is a definite time and a definite place, seeing a village, garden, etc., there is also a definite time when it can be obtained, but it does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081b29_1']	斯言為顯雖有決定時處之覺而無境故，彼於他成因無用故，即彼因云諸無境者便成時處不決定故。	斯言為顯雖有決定時處之覺而無境故，彼於他成因無用故，即彼因云諸無境者便成時處不決定故。	This statement is to show that even though there is a definite time and place, there is no object. Therefore, that reason is useless for establishing the other party. The reason is: because those without an object become indefinite in terms of time and place.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c02_7']	由斯道理，既有其定，故知所言彼之決定非顯有言，欲令成彼境無非有，不應道理，此即全無宗之過也。	由斯道理，既有其定，故知所言彼之決定非顯有言，欲令成彼境無非有，不應道理，此即全無宗之過也。	Due to this principle, since there is definiteness, it should be known that what is said about their definiteness does not show existence. The statement that it is desired to establish that the object does not exist is unreasonable, and this is a fault of the thesis itself.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c02_16']	又成立時能有功能。	又成立時能有功能。	Moreover, when establishing, it can have the function.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c03_2']	有功能說。	有功能說。	It is said to have the function.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c04_10']	所立既無能立非有，能遍無故所遍亦無，方能與他出其宗過。	所立既無能立非有，能遍無故所遍亦無，方能與他出其宗過。	Since the established [reason] does not exist, the means of establishing [it] do not exist. Since the universal does not exist, the particular also does not exist. Only then can one point out the faults of others' theses.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c05_4']	猶如於秤無其重故，無別有分。	猶如於秤無其重故，無別有分。	Just as on a scale, since there is no heaviness, there are no separate parts.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c05_18']	此既共許，說無重故便捨別物。	此既共許，說無重故便捨別物。	Since this is commonly accepted, by saying there is no heaviness one abandons separate entities.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c07_7']	然非於此翻彼便成時處定故能得成立令境是有，無隨成故。	然非於此翻彼便成時處定故能得成立令境是有，無隨成故。	However, it is not the case that by overturning this one immediately establishes the existence of objects, because of the restriction of time and place. There is no following establishment.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c08_5']	猶如耳識所聽聞性，不能成立聲是其常。	猶如耳識所聽聞性，不能成立聲是其常。	Just as the nature of what is heard by the ear consciousness cannot establish that sound is permanent.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c08_17']	雖無不聞性，然不遮無常。	雖無不聞性，然不遮無常。	Although there is no nature of not being heard, it does not negate impermanence.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c10_13']	他所成立外境是有，今欲顯其是不定因，縱非外事於情亦復見其時處有決定義。	他所成立外境是有，今欲顯其是不定因，縱非外事於情亦復見其時處有決定義。	The established external objects that exist, now in order to show that this is an indeterminate reason, even if not external events, in the mind one also sees the meaning of the restriction of time and place.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c12_9']	有說由心惑亂遂乃便生時處定解，然於夢中無其實境決定可得，故世共許。	有說由心惑亂遂乃便生時處定解，然於夢中無其實境決定可得，故世共許。	Some say that because of the confusion of the mind one then gives rise to the understanding of the restriction of time and place, but in a dream there is no real object that can be definitely obtained, therefore the world commonly accepts.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c13_3']	如何將此比餘定事為作過耶？	如何將此比餘定事為作過耶？	How can you take this as a fault compared to other established facts?
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c14_2']	若此夢想欲同覺者，理應夢心便是錯解。	若此夢想欲同覺者，理應夢心便是錯解。	If you want to equate this dream-like imagination with true cognition, then the mind in a dream would be a mistaken cognition.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c15_5']	斯則但是判在自應而為嚼咽，實不能知他之本意。	斯則但是判在自應而為嚼咽，實不能知他之本意。	This is just a case of judging for yourself what is appropriate and then swallowing it, and you are truly unable to understand the original intention of others.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c16_11']	非是他不許事，於此更令置其差別而難於他，成正理故。	非是他不許事，於此更令置其差別而難於他，成正理故。	It is not that others do not accept this matter, but they further require that distinctions be made and then fault others, because this constitutes correct reasoning.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c18_8']	此已於前善為通訖，由此所有時處定心外境非有，不應致難心帶相生何不合理？	此已於前善為通訖，由此所有時處定心外境非有，不應致難心帶相生何不合理？	This has already been well explained before. Therefore, all minds and objects that are restricted by time and place do not exist externally. One should not fault the mind that arises bearing characteristics as being unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c20_11']	又向所說，應言惑亂為定解者，許離識外無定時處，曾無非假遂令簡彼，安能別言望所餘事？	又向所說，應言惑亂為定解者，許離識外無定時處，曾無非假遂令簡彼，安能別言望所餘事？	Moreover, what was said before, that one should say that delusion is the established cognition, allows that there is no established time or place apart from consciousness. Since it has never been non-provisional, it finally causes one to select that. How can one separately say that it is hoped that other matters will be distinguished?
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c20_16']	斯為應理。	斯為應理。	This is reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c22_2']	然許如斯色類咸非外境，何須非處令安能別為出其過？	然許如斯色類咸非外境，何須非處令安能別為出其過？	However, it is accepted that these kinds of things are all not external objects. Why is it necessary to say that they are not in the proper place and then separately point out their faults?
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c22_17']	爾者於彼夢中實亦無其處時決定。	爾者於彼夢中實亦無其處時決定。	In that case, in the dream there is also no definite place and time.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c23_7']	相狀在心由何得知？	相狀在心由何得知？	How can the appearance be known to be in the mind?
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c23_12']	如有頌言：	如有頌言：	As a verse says:
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c24_0']	若眠於夜裏，　　見日北方生，	若眠於夜裏，　　見日北方生，	If one dreams at night, seeing the sun rising in the north,
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c25_13']	參差夢時處，　　如何有定心？	參差夢時處，　　如何有定心？	How can there be a definite mind in a dream with different places?
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c26_17']	此但不委前後所述，朋黨旨趣空愛巧詞。	此但不委前後所述，朋黨旨趣空愛巧詞。	This is just not understanding the meaning of the previous and later statements, vainly loving clever words.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c28_16']	由於時處不許，但言唯於此處，故不應詰處時決定，於他所許不相應故，如前已述。	由於時處不許，但言唯於此處，故不應詰處時決定，於他所許不相應故，如前已述。	Because time and place are not allowed, it is said that there is only in this place, so it should not be questioned that the place and time are definite, because it is not appropriate for what is accepted by others, as stated before.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c29_1']	復有立言：	復有立言：	There are also those who argue:
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c29_11']	夢心有境，是其念故。	夢心有境，是其念故。	The dreaming mind has an object, because it is recollection.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0081c29_20']	准知處等是其決定。	准知處等是其決定。	It should be known that the place, etc. are definite.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a01_17']	此即緣彼曾境起故，於其夢中多有所見。	此即緣彼曾境起故，於其夢中多有所見。	This is because it arises in dependence on that previously experienced object, so in the dream there is much that is seen.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a03_6']	設在空中見其流水、或於宏海都大火然，此亦是其昔時曾見。	設在空中見其流水、或於宏海都大火然，此亦是其昔時曾見。	Even if one sees flowing water in the sky, or a great fire burning in the vast ocean, this is also what was seen in the past.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a04_19']	若水若空、或炎或海，各於別處觀斷事物，夢中起念為一處解，執為空河。	若水若空、或炎或海，各於別處觀斷事物，夢中起念為一處解，執為空河。	Whether it is water, space, flames, or the ocean, each observes the severed things in different places. In a dream, one gives rise to thoughts and understands them as one place, grasping them as an empty river.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a05_13']	若不爾者，應許生盲憶青等故。	若不爾者，應許生盲憶青等故。	If it were not so, one would have to admit that the blind from birth can remember blue and so forth.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a07_6']	若不許此，於其夢中是憶念者，生盲之人應憶青蒨，凡為憶念是曾受故。	若不許此，於其夢中是憶念者，生盲之人應憶青蒨，凡為憶念是曾受故。	If this is not admitted, then in a dream, the one who remembers is the blind from birth who should remember blue. In general, memory is because of having received it before.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a08_1']	此輩於青不能生想，應成道理。	此輩於青不能生想，應成道理。	It would be reasonable for this group to be unable to give rise to the thought of blue.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a09_9']	又復夢中自觀斬首，此亦是念，合其餘事而有功能，如向陳說。	又復夢中自觀斬首，此亦是念，合其餘事而有功能，如向陳說。	Moreover, in a dream, one sees oneself having one's head cut off. This is also memory, combining with other things to have the ability, as explained above.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a11_7']	或中有位親見自身被他斫截，觀彼前身作自心解，曾受而捨今時尚憶，此固無違。	或中有位親見自身被他斫截，觀彼前身作自心解，曾受而捨今時尚憶，此固無違。	Or, in the intermediate state, one personally sees one's own body being cut by another, observing that previous body and understanding it as one's own mind. Having received it before and now still remembering it, this is certainly not contradictory.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a13_4']	豈不如先所經之物名為憶念，彼便夢中生其異見，非同昔時所觀之物，非不定故。	豈不如先所經之物名為憶念，彼便夢中生其異見，非同昔時所觀之物，非不定故。	Isn't it just like what was previously experienced being called memory? That person then gives rise to a different view in a dream, not the same as the thing observed in the past, not because it is indeterminate.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a15_16']	非唯一向曾所領事生憶念耶，即如多年曾所學業所有書疏，後起憶時，或倒次第、或復增言、或於其文而有忘失。	非唯一向曾所領事生憶念耶，即如多年曾所學業所有書疏，後起憶時，或倒次第、或復增言、或於其文而有忘失。	Is it not that memory arises only from things that have been previously experienced? For example, in the case of learning and writing over many years, when memory arises later, it may be in reverse order, or with added words, or with forgetting of the text.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a18_2']	若爾，此之憶念便成非有，憶念之境遂是空無，非餘實物別事相屬，於其決定實事想心而為施設。	若爾，此之憶念便成非有，憶念之境遂是空無，非餘實物別事相屬，於其決定實事想心而為施設。	If so, then this memory would become non-existent, and the object of memory would be empty and non-existent, not belonging to other real things and separate events, and would be established in the mind that conceives of real things.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a19_1']	如於馬首曾不觀角，然於憶時見其境事。	如於馬首曾不觀角，然於憶時見其境事。	For example, one has never seen horns on the head of a horse, but when one has a memory of it, one sees its object.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a19_19']	如曾領受為自解相，於其念處生其異解。	如曾領受為自解相，於其念處生其異解。	It is like the characteristic of understanding that has been experienced, which gives rise to a different understanding in the basis of memory.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a21_3']	不緣外境，然於夢中見馬有角如牛角者，准此應知。	不緣外境，然於夢中見馬有角如牛角者，准此應知。	It does not depend on external objects, but when one sees a horse with horns in a dream, like the horns of a cow, one should understand it in the same way.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a22_11']	於寤所見，遂在夢中起顛倒想，成立空河生其憶念，此亦如是。	於寤所見，遂在夢中起顛倒想，成立空河生其憶念，此亦如是。	In a dream, one sees what one has seen while awake, and then gives rise to an inverted thought, establishing an empty river and giving rise to memory, and this is also like that.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a24_2']	縱有非倒之見，於彼夢內相續識中而生其執，所見之相固非識外。	縱有非倒之見，於彼夢內相續識中而生其執，所見之相固非識外。	Even if there is a non-inverted view, it arises in the continuity of consciousness within that dream, and the seen characteristics are certainly not outside of consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a25_1']	是故當知，夢中憶念有真實境，道理不成。	是故當知，夢中憶念有真實境，道理不成。	Therefore, one should know that the recollection of real objects in a dream is not logically possible.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a26_16']	然復夢者所見之事，如在目前覩江山等，然非寤時所有憶念能得如斯分明顯著。	然復夢者所見之事，如在目前覩江山等，然非寤時所有憶念能得如斯分明顯著。	Moreover, the things seen by the dreamer, like seeing rivers and mountains right before one's eyes, are not like the recollections that exist during the waking state, which can be so clearly and distinctly perceived.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a27_8']	既無異相，何意不同？	既無異相，何意不同？	Since there is no difference in characteristics, why is it not the same?
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082a29_9']	於其夢內被睡亂心所生憶念，於境分明見在目前，然非於夢覺寤之後平善心中得有斯見。	於其夢內被睡亂心所生憶念，於境分明見在目前，然非於夢覺寤之後平善心中得有斯見。	The recollection produced by the mind disturbed by sleep in a dream clearly sees the object right before one's eyes, but it is not seen in the mind that is at peace after waking from the dream.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b01_17']	由如是故，而於夢中分明顯現彼此決斷，猶如覺時見境明白。	由如是故，而於夢中分明顯現彼此決斷，猶如覺時見境明白。	For this reason, the clear and distinct perception in a dream is like the clear perception of objects in the waking state.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b03_11']	准彼夢心所見之物非關憶念，先於夢中曾見有物，後時夢內憶前夢事。	准彼夢心所見之物非關憶念，先於夢中曾見有物，後時夢內憶前夢事。	According to that dream mind, the things seen are not related to recollection. Previously, in the dream, there were things seen, and later, within the dream, one recollects the previous dream events.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b05_4']	然斯夢憶，如彼覺人雖念其境狀似障隔，處遙遠時不能顯著觀其色等。	然斯夢憶，如彼覺人雖念其境狀似障隔，處遙遠時不能顯著觀其色等。	However, this dream memory, like the person who is awake, although remembering the appearance of the object, it is as if obstructed, distant, and unable to clearly observe its colors, etc.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b06_13']	又如所言，生盲之類於其夢中無所覩見，雖有巧詞，理應不成。	又如所言，生盲之類於其夢中無所覩見，雖有巧詞，理應不成。	Moreover, as it is said, the blind from birth do not see anything in their dreams. Although there are skillful words, the principle should not be established.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b07_15']	此亦隨其自種功能至成就位，遂於心上夢觀青等。	此亦隨其自種功能至成就位，遂於心上夢觀青等。	This also follows its own species' potential, reaching the stage of accomplishment, and then dreams of observing blue, etc. on the mind.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b09_4']	然此未曾而作計會，如餘流類雖夢青等，遂令言說啟發無由。	然此未曾而作計會，如餘流類雖夢青等，遂令言說啟發無由。	However, this has never been made into a theory, like the rest of the class. Although dreaming of blue, etc., it does not allow speech to be developed.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b10_12']	又夢所見多是今生不曾經事而現在前，是故夢心不關憶念。	又夢所見多是今生不曾經事而現在前，是故夢心不關憶念。	Moreover, what is seen in dreams is mostly things of the present life that have not been experienced before, therefore the dreaming mind is not related to memory.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b11_12']	縱令是念緣過境故，此則成立念境空無。	縱令是念緣過境故，此則成立念境空無。	Even if it is said to be memory because it conditions past objects, this then establishes that the objects of memory are empty and nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b12_7']	過去未來非現在故，猶如非有。	過去未來非現在故，猶如非有。	Because the past and future are not present, they are like what does not exist.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b14_17']	據實事故，此中意言其能緣覺境雖非有，然而時處決定可得，故知所許以境為先方能見者，未能於我作無利事。	據實事故，此中意言其能緣覺境雖非有，然而時處決定可得，故知所許以境為先方能見者，未能於我作無利事。	In reality, the meaning here is that although the objects of cognition do not exist, the time and place are definite and can be obtained. Therefore, it is known that those who accept that seeing occurs only after the object exists have not yet done anything beneficial for me.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b15_3']	有餘復言：	有餘復言：	Others say:
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b16_12']	由夢障心有力用故，於其別事暫時生起，識體清淨無礙現前。	由夢障心有力用故，於其別事暫時生起，識體清淨無礙現前。	Because the mind is obstructed by dreams, it has power and function, so it temporarily arises from other things, and the pure consciousness manifests unobstructed.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b17_11']	猶如定者三摩地力，清淨光明觀無礙故。	猶如定者三摩地力，清淨光明觀無礙故。	It is like the power of samādhi of one in samādhi, because the pure light observes without obstruction.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b18_10', 'ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b20_14']	如於小室夢覿象群，及覩諸餘廣大之物。🔽又夢見自身於別界趣等在彼託生，然不能言於彼餘體非執受身為我身解，如非夢時受用之體。	如於小室夢覿象群，及覩諸餘廣大之物。 又夢見自身於別界趣等在彼託生，然不能言於彼餘體非執受身為我身解，如非夢時受用之體。	It is like dreaming of a herd of elephants in a small room, and seeing other vast things.🔽Also, in a dream one sees oneself reborn in another realm or destiny, etc., but one cannot say that the body not grasped by that other is understood as one's own body, like the body experienced at a time not dreaming.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b22_11']	然非不捨此趣之身更執餘處得有斯理，復非此時有其生死便成見有亡屍之過。	然非不捨此趣之身更執餘處得有斯理，復非此時有其生死便成見有亡屍之過。	However, it is not the case that one abandons the body of this realm and grasps another, and there is this principle. Moreover, it is not the case that at this time there is death and rebirth, which would result in the fault of seeing a dead body.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b24_14']	又復縱許有其生死，然於重生有其違害，後時覺寤，其舊體曾無毫釐虧損處。	又復縱許有其生死，然於重生有其違害，後時覺寤，其舊體曾無毫釐虧損處。	Moreover, even if we allow that there is birth and death, there is still the contradiction of being reborn, because when one awakens later, the old body is not the slightest bit damaged.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b26_3']	又於臥時，傍人不曾見身有異，然此漸頓於受生時有相違失。	又於臥時，傍人不曾見身有異，然此漸頓於受生時有相違失。	Moreover, when one is lying down, those beside one never see the body as different. However, there is the fault of contradiction in gradual or sudden rebirth.
['ZH_T31_1591_002:0082b28_1']	由此應知，但唯是識於彼熏習功能現時，即便觀見種種相貌分明在心，斯為應理。	由此應知，但唯是識於彼熏習功能現時，即便觀見種種相貌分明在心，斯為應理。	For this reason, one should understand that it is only consciousness, when the power of perfuming in that [consciousness] appears, that one immediately sees various appearances clearly in the mind. This is reasonable.

How can it not be necessary for the extremely evil jailors and so forth to be established as non-existent before they can be taken as the established events?

However, when evil beings are born there, they experience that suffering together, because they are born in that place due to common karma.
