['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873b29_17']	辯業品第五之四如是已說得律儀等，捨律儀等今次當說。	辯業品第五之四如是已說得律儀等，捨律儀等今次當說。	021	Chapter 5, Part 4: Discrimination of Action, on relinquishing the prātimokṣa restraint, etc. Thus far the prātimokṣa restraint, etc., have been explained. Now the relinquishment of the prātimokṣa restraint, etc., will be explained next.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c01_8']	且云何捨別解脫律儀？	且云何捨別解脫律儀？	021	First, how is the prātimokṣa restraint relinquished?

['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c02_0']	捨別解調伏，　　由故捨命終，	捨別解調伏，　　由故捨命終，	021	The prātimokṣa restraint is relinquished by intentionally abandoning it, death,
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c03_13']	及二形俱生，　　斷善根夜盡。	及二形俱生，　　斷善根夜盡。	021	The arising of both sexes, severing the wholesome roots, and the end of the night.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c04_13']	有說由犯重，　　餘說由法滅；	有說由犯重，　　餘說由法滅；	021	Some say it is by committing a grave offense, others say by the Dharma's disappearance;

['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c07_1']	調伏聲顯律儀異名，由此能令根調伏故。	調伏聲顯律儀異名，由此能令根調伏故。	021	The term taming indicates a different name for the restraint, because it can tame the faculties.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c07_10']	由五緣捨別解律儀：	由五緣捨別解律儀：	021	The prātimokṣa restraint is relinquished by five causes:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c09_8']	一由故捨，謂於律儀由阿世耶不懷欣慕，為捨學處，對有解人發起相違表業差別。	一由故捨，謂於律儀由阿世耶不懷欣慕，為捨學處，對有解人發起相違表業差別。	021	First, by intentionally abandoning it. That is, by not cherishing the intention for the restraint, for the sake of abandoning the precepts, one generates a contradictory expression of action towards one who understands.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c10_7']	非但由起捨學處心，如得律儀心無能故。	非但由起捨學處心，如得律儀心無能故。	021	It is not only by the arising of the thought of abandoning the precepts, because the thought of obtaining the precepts is powerless.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c10_16', 'ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c11_15']	又在夢中捨不成故。🔽非但由起表業差別，忿癲狂等捨不成故。	又在夢中捨不成故。 非但由起表業差別，忿癲狂等捨不成故。	021	Also, abandoning in a dream is not valid.🔽It is not only by the arising of the differences in the manifest actions, because abandoning by anger, insanity, etc. is not valid.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c12_14']	非但由二對傍生等起心發表，捨不成故。	非但由二對傍生等起心發表，捨不成故。	021	It is not only by the arising of the thought and the manifest action toward animals, etc., because abandoning is not valid.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c13_12']	二由命終，謂眾同分增上勢力得律儀故。	二由命終，謂眾同分增上勢力得律儀故。	021	Second, by death, because the precepts are obtained by the power of the increase of the common portion.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c15_2']	三由依止二形俱生，謂身變時心隨變故，又二形者非增上故。	三由依止二形俱生，謂身變時心隨變故，又二形者非增上故。	021	Third, by the simultaneous arising of the two organs, because when the body changes, the mind also changes, and also because one with two organs is not superior.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c16_3']	四由斷滅所因善根，謂表無表業等起心斷故。	四由斷滅所因善根，謂表無表業等起心斷故。	021	Fourth, by the annihilation of the wholesome roots that are the cause, because the manifest actions, unmanifest actions, and the arising thought are annihilated.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c17_2']	是此律儀因緣斷義，捨盡壽戒由上四緣。	是此律儀因緣斷義，捨盡壽戒由上四緣。	021	This is the meaning of the annihilation of the causes of these precepts. The precepts for the duration of life are abandoned by the above four conditions.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c18_9']	近住律儀亦由夜盡，謂近住戒由上四緣及夜盡捨過期限故。	近住律儀亦由夜盡，謂近住戒由上四緣及夜盡捨過期限故。	021	The precepts of the upavāsa are also abandoned by the end of the night, because the precepts of the upavāsa are abandoned by the above four conditions and by the end of the night, because the period is exceeded.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c19_8']	夜盡者，謂明相出時，諸軌範師多分共許。	夜盡者，謂明相出時，諸軌範師多分共許。	021	When the night ends means when the dawn appears, this is generally accepted by the masters.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c20_16']	如是五種捨律儀緣，有餘部師執，隨犯一感墮重罪捨出家戒。	如是五種捨律儀緣，有餘部師執，隨犯一感墮重罪捨出家戒。	021	Regarding these five causes of relinquishing the prātimokṣa restraint, some other schools hold that when one commits a grave offense leading to an infraction, one relinquishes the restraint of leaving the household life.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c22_12']	有餘部執，正法滅時別解律儀無不皆捨，以諸學處結界羯磨所有聖教皆息滅故。	有餘部執，正法滅時別解律儀無不皆捨，以諸學處結界羯磨所有聖教皆息滅故。	021	Some other schools hold that when the true Dharma perishes, all prātimokṣa restraints are not relinquished, because all the precepts, boundary-marking karman, and the holy teachings all cease.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c23_3']	對法諸師作如是說：	對法諸師作如是說：	021	The masters of the Abhidharma say:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c24_4']	爾時雖無得未得律儀，而先得律儀無有捨義。	爾時雖無得未得律儀，而先得律儀無有捨義。	021	At that time, although there is no obtaining of the restraint that has not yet been obtained, there is no relinquishment of the previously obtained restraint.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c25_6']	迦濕彌羅國毘婆沙師蘊理教於心，作如是說：	迦濕彌羅國毘婆沙師蘊理教於心，作如是說：	021	The Kāśmīri Vaibhāṣikas, who hold the teachings and principles in their minds, say:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c26_4']	非犯隨一根本罪時，一切律儀皆有捨義。	非犯隨一根本罪時，一切律儀皆有捨義。	021	When one commits any one of the fundamental offenses, all the restraints are not necessarily relinquished.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c27_5']	然犯重者有二種名，一名具尸羅、二名犯戒者。	然犯重者有二種名，一名具尸羅、二名犯戒者。	021	However, one who commits a grave offense has two kinds of names: one is called one who possesses morality, and the other is called one who violates the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c28_4']	若於所犯應可悔除，發露悔除唯名具戒。	若於所犯應可悔除，發露悔除唯名具戒。	021	If one repents and confesses the offense, one is only called one who possesses morality.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0873c29_13']	如有財者負他債時，名為富人及負債者，若還債已但名富人。	如有財者負他債時，名為富人及負債者，若還債已但名富人。	021	It is like a wealthy person who owes another a debt being called both wealthy and one who owes a debt. If the debt is repaid, he is then called only wealthy.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a01_3']	此亦應然，故非捨戒。	此亦應然，故非捨戒。	021	This is also so for the relinquishment of precepts.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a01_18']	靜慮、無漏二律儀等，云何當捨？	靜慮、無漏二律儀等，云何當捨？	021	How are the two types of restraint of dhyana and pure precepts relinquished?

['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a03_0']	捨定生善法，　　由易地退等，	捨定生善法，　　由易地退等，	021	The wholesome dharmas born of dhyana are relinquished by changing stages or regressing, etc.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a04_13']	捨諸無漏善，　　由得果退失。	捨諸無漏善，　　由得果退失。	021	All pure wholesome dharmas are relinquished by attaining fruition or regressing.

['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a05_16']	諸靜慮地所繫善法，由二緣捨：	諸靜慮地所繫善法，由二緣捨：	021	The wholesome dharmas associated with the stages of dhyana are relinquished by two causes:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a06_6']	一由易地，謂上下生；	一由易地，謂上下生；	021	First, by changing stages, referring to being born above or below;
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a06_16']	二由退失，謂退勝定。	二由退失，謂退勝定。	021	Second, by regressing, referring to regressing from superior samādhi.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a07_14']	捨眾同分及離染時，亦捨暖等及退分定。	捨眾同分及離染時，亦捨暖等及退分定。	021	When relinquishing the same life-stream and when free from defilements, one also relinquishes the warmth, etc., and the fixed samādhi of the stage of regression.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a08_6']	為攝此故，復說等言。	為攝此故，復說等言。	021	In order to include these, the word etc. is again used.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a09_4']	如捨色善由易地退，及離染三無色亦爾。	如捨色善由易地退，及離染三無色亦爾。	021	Just as wholesome dharmas of the form realm are relinquished by changing stages, regressing, and being free from defilements, so it is for the three formless realms.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a09_13']	捨無漏善由二種緣：	捨無漏善由二種緣：	021	Pure wholesome dharmas are relinquished by two kinds of causes:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a10_13']	一由得果總捨前道、二由退失捨諸勝道。	一由得果總捨前道、二由退失捨諸勝道。	021	First, one abandons the previous path by attaining the fruit. Second, one abandons the superior paths by falling back.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a11_4']	此或是果，或勝果攝。	此或是果，或勝果攝。	021	This is either the fruit or the fruit of a superior fruit.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a11_13']	我於此中應少分別。	我於此中應少分別。	021	Here I should make a brief distinction.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a13_4']	若捨見道及道類智、當知但由得果非退，道類智果攝亦必無退故。	若捨見道及道類智、當知但由得果非退，道類智果攝亦必無退故。	021	If one abandons the path of insight and the path of insight into the nature of things, one should know that it is only by attaining the fruit, not by falling back, because the fruit of the path of insight into the nature of things is also necessarily without falling back.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a13_13']	退所練根亦有退義。	退所練根亦有退義。	021	The faculties that have been cultivated by falling back also have the meaning of falling back.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a14_12']	若不動法無學俱無，所餘無漏容具二種。	若不動法無學俱無，所餘無漏容具二種。	021	For the immovable dharma, both learners and post-learners are both without. The remaining uncontaminated [precepts] may have both kinds.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a15_2']	如是已說捨諸律儀。	如是已說捨諸律儀。	021	Thus far, the abandonment of various precepts has been explained.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a15_9']	不律儀云何捨？	不律儀云何捨？	021	How is the non-restraint abandoned?
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a15_12']	頌曰：	頌曰：	021	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a16_13']	捨惡戒由死，　　得戒二形生。	捨惡戒由死，　　得戒二形生。	021	Non-restraint is abandoned by death, obtaining precepts, or the appearance of two genders.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a17_2']	論曰：	論曰：	021	Treatise:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a17_12']	諸不律儀，由三緣捨：	諸不律儀，由三緣捨：	021	Non-restraint is abandoned by three causes:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a18_10']	一者由死捨所依故，眾同分力得律儀故。	一者由死捨所依故，眾同分力得律儀故。	021	First, by death, because the basis is abandoned. Because the power of the same species obtains the precepts.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a20_8']	二由得戒，謂若受得別解律儀，或由獲得靜慮律儀，惡戒便捨，對治力勝捨不律儀。	二由得戒，謂若受得別解律儀，或由獲得靜慮律儀，惡戒便捨，對治力勝捨不律儀。	021	Second, by obtaining morality, that is, if one obtains the morality of individual liberation, or if one obtains the morality of meditation, then the evil morality is abandoned, because the power of the antidote is superior and one abandons the non-restraint.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a21_7']	三由相續二形俱起，以於爾時所依變故。	三由相續二形俱起，以於爾時所依變故。	021	Third, by the two organs of the continuity arising together, because at that time the basis changes.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a22_18']	不律儀者受近住戒，至夜盡位捨律儀時，為得不律儀、為名處中者？	不律儀者受近住戒，至夜盡位捨律儀時，為得不律儀、為名處中者？	021	When one who is unrestrained receives the precepts of the upavāsa and, at the end of the night, abandons the restraint, does one obtain the non-restraint, or is one called neutral?
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a23_3']	有餘師說：	有餘師說：	021	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a24_6']	得不律儀，惡阿世耶非永捨故，如停熱鐵赤滅青生。	得不律儀，惡阿世耶非永捨故，如停熱鐵赤滅青生。	021	One obtains the non-restraint, because the evil intention is not permanently abandoned, just as when a heated iron cools and turns red, and then turns blue.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a24_11']	有餘師言：	有餘師言：	021	Other masters say:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a25_14']	若不更作，無緣令彼得不律儀，以不律儀依表得故。	若不更作，無緣令彼得不律儀，以不律儀依表得故。	021	If one does not commit again, there is no condition for one to obtain the non-restraint, because the non-restraint is obtained based on the expression.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a27_3']	前說應理，先受戒時惡阿世耶非永捨故，依前表業惡戒還起。	前說應理，先受戒時惡阿世耶非永捨故，依前表業惡戒還起。	021	The former explanation is reasonable, because at the time of first receiving the precepts, the evil intention is not permanently abandoned, and the evil morality arises again based on the previous expression.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a27_12']	處中無表捨復云何？	處中無表捨復云何？	021	How is the neutral indeterminate form abandoned again?
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a27_15']	頌曰：	頌曰：	021	Verse:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a28_13']	捨中由受勢，　　作事壽根斷。	捨中由受勢，　　作事壽根斷。	021	In the middle, by the power of feeling, by action, by the end of life.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a29_2']	論曰：	論曰：	021	The treatise says:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874a29_12']	處中無表，捨由六緣：	處中無表，捨由六緣：	021	The indeterminate form of the middle is abandoned by six conditions:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b01_19']	一由受心斷壞故捨，謂先誓受，恒於某時敬禮制多及讚頌等。	一由受心斷壞故捨，謂先誓受，恒於某時敬禮制多及讚頌等。	021	First, by the abandonment of the mind of acceptance. This refers to the vow to always respectfully pay homage to stupas and chant praises at a certain time.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b02_4']	今作是念：	今作是念：	021	Now, one thinks:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b02_9']	後不更為。	後不更為。	021	I will not do it again later.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b03_7']	彼阿世耶從茲便息，由彼棄捨本意樂故。	彼阿世耶從茲便息，由彼棄捨本意樂故。	021	Their intention ceases from this point on, because they abandon their original intention.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b04_15']	或復別作勢用增強，與先現行相違事業，本意樂息無表便斷。	或復別作勢用增強，與先現行相違事業，本意樂息無表便斷。	021	Or else, they do something else whose power is stronger, which contradicts the previous action. The original intention ceases, and the indeterminate form is cut off.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b07_3']	二由勢力斷壞故捨，謂由淨信、煩惱勢力所引無表，彼二限勢若斷壞時無表便捨，如所放箭及陶家輪。	二由勢力斷壞故捨，謂由淨信、煩惱勢力所引無表，彼二限勢若斷壞時無表便捨，如所放箭及陶家輪。	021	Second, by the abandonment of power. This refers to the indeterminate form attracted by the power of pure faith and afflictions. When the limit of their power is cut off, the indeterminate form is abandoned, like an arrow shot or a potter's wheel.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b07_12']	故軌範師作如是說：	故軌範師作如是說：	021	Therefore, the teachers say:
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b09_18']	由等起力所引發故，雖捨加行及阿世耶，無表或容盡壽隨轉，乃至發起極猛利纏捶擊禽獸應知亦爾。	由等起力所引發故，雖捨加行及阿世耶，無表或容盡壽隨轉，乃至發起極猛利纏捶擊禽獸應知亦爾。	021	Because it is attracted and produced by the power of the initial thought, even though one abandons the added effort and the intention, the noninformative may still continue to function for the rest of one’s life. This is also the case when one arouses a very strong fetter and strikes a bird or beast.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b10_17']	或先立限齊爾所時，今限勢過無表便斷。	或先立限齊爾所時，今限勢過無表便斷。	021	Or, one may have previously established a limit, such as, “I will do this for a certain period of time,” and when the force of the limit is exhausted, the noninformative is also cut off.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b12_15']	三由作業斷壞故捨，謂雖不捨根本受心，然更不為所受作業，唯除忘念而不作者。	三由作業斷壞故捨，謂雖不捨根本受心，然更不為所受作業，唯除忘念而不作者。	021	Third, one abandons the noninformative by cutting off the action that constitutes the basis for it, that is, even though one does not abandon the fundamental attitude that constitutes the basis, one no longer performs the action that was undertaken, with the exception of the case where one forgets to perform it.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b13_15']	以此無表期加行生，絕加行時無表便捨。	以此無表期加行生，絕加行時無表便捨。	021	This is because this noninformative action is generated by the added effort of a vow, and when the added effort is cut off, the noninformative action is also cut off.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b16_3']	四由事物斷壞故捨，謂所捨施制多園林，及所施為罝網等事，本由彼事引無表生，彼事壞時無表便捨。	四由事物斷壞故捨，謂所捨施制多園林，及所施為罝網等事，本由彼事引無表生，彼事壞時無表便捨。	021	Fourth, one abandons the noninformative by cutting off the thing that constitutes the basis for it, that is, one gives up a gift to a caitya, a garden, a forest, or other thing, or one cuts off a net or other device that one had previously established. The noninformative action that was generated by that thing is cut off when the thing is destroyed.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b17_2']	五由壽命斷壞故捨，謂所依止有轉易故。	五由壽命斷壞故捨，謂所依止有轉易故。	021	Fifth, one abandons the noninformative by cutting off the life that constitutes the basis for it, because the support has changed.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b18_10']	六由依根斷壞故捨，謂起加行斷善惡時，各捨彼根所引無表。	六由依根斷壞故捨，謂起加行斷善惡時，各捨彼根所引無表。	021	Sixth, by the severing of the organ, that is, when one generates the practice of severing good or evil, one abandons the nonmanifest action attracted by that organ.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b20_7']	非至斷善、得靜慮時方捨處中善惡無表，以羸劣故，起加行時便捨處中善惡無表。	非至斷善、得靜慮時方捨處中善惡無表，以羸劣故，起加行時便捨處中善惡無表。	021	When one severs the nonconcentrated good or evil nonmanifest action of the realm of desire, one abandons it by the arising of the antidote.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0874b20_16']	所言根者通善惡根。	所言根者通善惡根。	021	The word organ here refers to the good or evil organs.

Therefore, the two types of karma that are conducive to rebirth and conducive to continuation are excluded. In the place where one is reborn, one can create karma that is conducive to the experience of the present life. One can also create indeterminate karma. There is no prohibition against this in any place.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0876a23_12']	然諸聖者若於欲界及有頂處已得離染，雖有退墮而亦不造順生後業，從彼退者必退果故。	然諸聖者若於欲界及有頂處已得離染，雖有退墮而亦不造順生後業，從彼退者必退果故。	021	However, if the noble one has already become detached from the realm of desire and the peak of existence, even though he retrogresses, he still does not create karma that is conducive to rebirth or conducive to continuation. This is because one who retrogresses from this stage necessarily retrogresses from the fruit.

The supreme tranquil merit adorns one's body and becomes the basis for the growth of sincere and pure thoughts.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0876c22_15']	二從無諍出，謂此定中已能永拔一切煩惱災患相續，有緣一切有情為境，所起無邊增上意樂、無諍功德積集熏身，從此出時彼心相續，不為一切世間定心及不定心之所勝伏，是福非福近果勝田。	二從無諍出，謂此定中已能永拔一切煩惱災患相續，有緣一切有情為境，所起無邊增上意樂、無諍功德積集熏身，從此出時彼心相續，不為一切世間定心及不定心之所勝伏，是福非福近果勝田。	021	Second, when one emerges from the concentration of non-conflict, one is able to forever eliminate the continuity of all afflictions and calamities.

['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b06_1']	謂地獄異熟唯不善業感，故順彼受名純黑業。	謂地獄異熟唯不善業感，故順彼受名純黑業。	021	Because the retribution of hell is produced only by unwholesome karma, karma whose results are to be experienced in hell is called pure black karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b07_10']	唯除地獄，餘欲界中異熟皆通善惡業感，故順彼受名黑白業。	唯除地獄，餘欲界中異熟皆通善惡業感，故順彼受名黑白業。	021	With the exception of hell, the retributions of the other destinies of the realm of desire are produced by both wholesome and unwholesome karma, and therefore karma whose results are to be experienced in these destinies is called mixed black and white karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b08_8']	如是所說前已遮遣，謂善無能雜不善故。	如是所說前已遮遣，謂善無能雜不善故。	021	The above explanation is refuted by the following passage: Wholesome karma is not mixed with unwholesome karma.

['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b09_16']	欲見所斷及欲界中所有餘業，如次名為純黑俱業。	欲見所斷及欲界中所有餘業，如次名為純黑俱業。	021	karma to be eliminated by the path of insight in the realm of desire and all other karma of the realm of desire are called, respectively, pure black karma and mixed black and white karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b11_5']	謂見所斷無善雜故名純黑業，欲修所斷有善不善故名俱業。	謂見所斷無善雜故名純黑業，欲修所斷有善不善故名俱業。	021	Because karma to be eliminated by the path of insight is not mixed with wholesome karma, it is called pure black karma. Because karma to be eliminated by the path of cultivation in the realm of desire is both wholesome and unwholesome, it is called mixed black and white karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b12_6']	此亦非理，二所斷中俱有業不能感異熟果故。	此亦非理，二所斷中俱有業不能感異熟果故。	021	This explanation is also unreasonable, because both of these kinds of karma are incapable of producing retribution.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b13_16']	若謂此中所說三業據有異熟說非無異熟者，不應簡言欲見所滅。	若謂此中所說三業據有異熟說非無異熟者，不應簡言欲見所滅。	021	If you claim that the three kinds of karma mentioned in the above passage refer to karma that has retribution and not to karma that lacks retribution, then you should not specify that karma to be eliminated by the path of insight in the realm of desire is pure black karma.
['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b16_18']	又強力業理必不應為力劣者之所𣣋雜，是故不應說修所斷諸不善業亦得離名，亦不應言欲界有善力勝不善𣣋伏惡業，非所許故。	又強力業理必不應為力劣者之所𣣋雜，是故不應說修所斷諸不善業亦得離名，亦不應言欲界有善力勝不善𣣋伏惡業，非所許故。	021	Moreover, it is logically impossible for powerful karma to be mixed with that of inferior power. Therefore, it should not be said that unwholesome karma to be eliminated by cultivation also attains the name of being dissociated. It should also not be said that in the desire realm, wholesome karma is more powerful than unwholesome karma, suppressing unwholesome karma, because this is not accepted.

['ZH_T29_1563_021:0878b18_3']	以欲界善非數行故，無有能感一劫果故。	以欲界善非數行故，無有能感一劫果故。	021	Because wholesome karma in the desire realm is not frequently practiced, and cannot produce results for one eon.🔽Here is the corrected and aligned text:
