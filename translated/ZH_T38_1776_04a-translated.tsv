['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501b21_15']	解有四義：	解有四義：	There are four explanations:
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501b22_10']	一、前者念坐通為大小，故前等告。	一、前者念坐通為大小，故前等告。	First, in the previous case, he thought of the sitting as being for both the great and small, so he universally told them.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501b23_13']	今此念食，偏為菩薩，恐彼聲聞不敢取食，故偏告之。	今此念食，偏為菩薩，恐彼聲聞不敢取食，故偏告之。	Here he thought of the food as being specifically for the bodhisattvas, fearing that the śrāvakas would not dare to take the food, so he specifically told them.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501b24_8']	第二、床坐大小通須，故所通告。	第二、床坐大小通須，故所通告。	Second, the bed and sitting are both necessary for both the great and small, so he universally told them.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501b25_11']	食中聲聞別有乞法，於此所取無心欲食，故偏告之。	食中聲聞別有乞法，於此所取無心欲食，故偏告之。	In the food, the śrāvakas have a separate begging method. They have no intention of eating what they take, so he specifically told them.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501b27_13']	第三義者，前所取坐至極高大，通此人量，須教菩薩變身如坐，須教聲聞禮佛而坐，為是通告。	第三義者，前所取坐至極高大，通此人量，須教菩薩變身如坐，須教聲聞禮佛而坐，為是通告。	The third explanation is that the previously taken sitting is extremely high and large, universally accommodating human size. He needed to teach the bodhisattvas to transform their bodies to be like the sitting, and he needed to teach the śrāvakas to bow to the Buddha and sit. For this reason, he universally told them.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501b29_2']	今所取食至少不多，聲聞心局畏少不足，無心欲食，為是次告。	今所取食至少不多，聲聞心局畏少不足，無心欲食，為是次告。	The food that is now taken is little and not much. The śrāvakas' minds are narrow, fearing that it is little and not enough, and they have no intention of eating. For this reason, he next told them.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501c01_2']	菩薩意廣，知少竟多，不慮不食，是故不告。	菩薩意廣，知少竟多，不慮不食，是故不告。	The bodhisattvas' minds are vast, knowing that a little is actually much, and not worrying about not eating, therefore they did not announce it.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501c02_1']	第四義者，向前取坐不簡大小，故前通告。	第四義者，向前取坐不簡大小，故前通告。	The fourth meaning is that previously when taking seats, they did not discriminate between large and small, therefore it was announced in a general way.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501c04_17']	今此取食，云言此樂小法者得弘大道，彼佛與食意亦如之，良以聲聞正是所為，故今偏告，欲使共食，知飯無盡，發心願求。	今此取食，云言此樂小法者得弘大道，彼佛與食意亦如之，良以聲聞正是所為，故今偏告，欲使共食，知飯無盡，發心願求。	Now when taking this food, it is said that those who enjoy the lesser teachings can attain the great path. The Buddha's intention in giving them food is also like this. Since the śrāvakas are precisely the intended recipients, now it is announced in a biased way, wishing for them to eat together, knowing that the food is inexhaustible, and to give rise to the aspiration to seek it.
['ZH_T38_1776_04a:0501c05_1']	義意如是。	義意如是。	The meaning is like this.
