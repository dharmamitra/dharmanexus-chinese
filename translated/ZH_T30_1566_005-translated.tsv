In this way, the one who is attached and attachment, etc., in the conventional truth are like an illusion, a mirage, a dream, and a gandharva city, not in the ultimate truth.

['ZH_T30_1566_005:0073a28_16']	又染者起染，終無得義。	又染者起染，終無得義。	005	Moreover, the arising of defilement by the defiled one is ultimately without the meaning of attainment.
