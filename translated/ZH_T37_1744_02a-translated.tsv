['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c02_8']	故《涅槃》云「發心畢竟二不別」，《大品》云「菩薩從初發心即行無所得」，故知起自初發心即行無所得，故知起自初心。	故《涅槃》云「發心畢竟二不別」，《大品》云「菩薩從初發心即行無所得」，故知起自初發心即行無所得，故知起自初心。	02a	Therefore, the Nirvana Sutra says, The initial aspiration and the final stage are not different, and the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says, The bodhisattva from the initial aspiration practices the attainment of nothing, therefore it is known that the initial aspiration is the initial mind.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c04_8']	但成在初地，故前文云「若忘失正法，不得越凡夫地」，故知不忘正法便能越凡，即初地也。	但成在初地，故前文云「若忘失正法，不得越凡夫地」，故知不忘正法便能越凡，即初地也。	02a	But it is accomplished in the first ground, therefore the previous text says, If one forgets the true Dharma, one cannot transcend the stage of ordinary beings, therefore it is known that not forgetting the true Dharma can transcend the ordinary, which is the first ground.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c05_11']	《仁王》云「初地一心具八萬波羅蜜」，故知成在初地。	《仁王》云「初地一心具八萬波羅蜜」，故知成在初地。	02a	The Benevolent Kings' Sutra says, In the first ground, one mind possesses eighty thousand perfections, therefore it is known that it is accomplished in the first ground.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c06_1']	任運現前，則居八地也；	任運現前，則居八地也；	02a	Spontaneously appearing, one abides in the eighth ground.

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c09_17']	顯證在心，名為攝受。	顯證在心，名為攝受。	02a	The manifestation of realization in the mind is called acceptance.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c10_13']	今謂錄法在心為攝，如法領證為受。	今謂錄法在心為攝，如法領證為受。	02a	The present explanation says: Recording the Dharma in the mind is acceptance, and receiving it according to the Dharma is acceptance.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c11_10']	大宗猶是悟解於理，與理相應名攝。	大宗猶是悟解於理，與理相應名攝。	02a	The great principle is still the understanding and realization of the principle, and being in accord with the principle is called acceptance.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c12_6']	攝受之德，妙出心言，名不思議。	攝受之德，妙出心言，名不思議。	02a	The virtue of acceptance is wonderfully beyond the realm of mind and words, and is called inconceivable.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c12_19']	即是心行處滅、言語道斷也。	即是心行處滅、言語道斷也。	02a	This is the cessation of the realm of mental activity and the cutting off of verbal expression.

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c19_4']	今欲為眾談上地之法，是故稱說。	今欲為眾談上地之法，是故稱說。	02a	Now, I wish to discuss the dharmas of the upper grounds for the assembly, and therefore it is called expounding.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c19_18']	就說法中有十章經，大開為二：	就說法中有十章經，大開為二：	02a	Within the expounding of the Dharma, there are ten chapters of sūtra, which are broadly divided into two parts:

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c21_10']	然行由境成，應前境而後行；	然行由境成，應前境而後行；	02a	However, practice is accomplished through the realm, and should follow the realm before practice;
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c22_16']	但為攝上願行之因，明攝受一乘之果，是故前行後境。	但為攝上願行之因，明攝受一乘之果，是故前行後境。	02a	But in order to include the causes of the vows and practices above, and clarify the fruition of the subsumption of the One Vehicle, therefore practice comes before the realm.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c23_5']	就境行各開為二。	就境行各開為二。	02a	Within the realm and practice, each is divided into two parts.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c24_7']	行中二者，攝受明廣大出生、一乘辨無二收入。	行中二者，攝受明廣大出生、一乘辨無二收入。	02a	The two parts of practice are: subsumption clarifies vastness and origination, and the One Vehicle distinguishes non-duality and inclusion.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c25_7']	佛法雖曠，此二網羅，無義不盡，後當具說。	佛法雖曠，此二網羅，無義不盡，後當具說。	02a	Although the Buddha Dharma is vast, these two encompass it, leaving no meaning unexhausted, which will be fully explained later.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c25_18']	就攝受一章，大開為二：	就攝受一章，大開為二：	02a	Within the one chapter on subsumption, it is broadly divided into two parts:

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c27_16']	又略說明收入義，謂攝一切諸願悉入一願；	又略說明收入義，謂攝一切諸願悉入一願；	02a	Moreover, the brief explanation clarifies the meaning of inclusion, which means that all vows are included in one vow;
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0027c29_2']	廣說辨出生義，明攝受正法出生八萬法藏恒沙法門。	廣說辨出生義，明攝受正法出生八萬法藏恒沙法門。	02a	The extensive explanation clarifies the meaning of giving rise, which clarifies that the Dharma gate of the ocean-like sand of the eighty thousand Dharma-treasuries arises from embracing the true Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a01_1']	又初明攝受正法體，正體外更無有法；	又初明攝受正法體，正體外更無有法；	02a	Moreover, the former clarifies the essence of embracing the true Dharma, outside of the true essence there is no other Dharma;
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a01_17']	次明攝受正法用，更無有出正法用。	次明攝受正法用，更無有出正法用。	02a	Next, it clarifies the function of embracing the true Dharma, there is no function that surpasses the true Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a03_9']	又前明攝受正法願、後明攝受正法行，欲顯攝受正法總攝一切願行也。	又前明攝受正法願、後明攝受正法行，欲顯攝受正法總攝一切願行也。	02a	Moreover, the former clarifies the vow of embracing the true Dharma, and the latter clarifies the practice of embracing the true Dharma, wishing to show that embracing the true Dharma comprehensively includes all vows and practices.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a04_12']	前三章明初行後願，以歸戒為本，方以大願扶持。	前三章明初行後願，以歸戒為本，方以大願扶持。	02a	The first three chapters clarify practice first and vow later, taking the precepts as the basis, and then using great vows to support them.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a05_16']	今印述他行，成前三願，故前明願攝、後明行攝也。	今印述他行，成前三願，故前明願攝、後明行攝也。	02a	Now, it praises the practices of others, accomplishing the previous three vows, therefore, it first clarifies the vow of embracing and then the practice of embracing.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a06_5']	就此二章各開為四。	就此二章各開為四。	02a	In these two chapters, each is divided into four parts.

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a08_13']	「勝鬘」者，說法之人也。	「勝鬘」者，說法之人也。	02a	Śrīmālā refers to the person who expounds the Dharma.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a09_1']	「白佛言」者，諮啟上聖也。	「白佛言」者，諮啟上聖也。	02a	She addressed the Buddha, saying means to consult with the superior sage.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a10_12']	「我今當復承佛威神」者，夫弟子說法，大聖在座，要假佛威神方乃得說；	「我今當復承佛威神」者，夫弟子說法，大聖在座，要假佛威神方乃得說；	02a	I will now further rely on the Buddha's majestic spiritual power means that when a disciple expounds the Dharma, the great sage is seated, and must rely on the Buddha's majestic spiritual power in order to be able to speak;
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a11_16']	不蒙教輒爾而言，即是慢相，故言當承佛力說也。	不蒙教輒爾而言，即是慢相，故言當承佛力說也。	02a	if one speaks without receiving permission, it is a sign of arrogance, so it is said that one should rely on the Buddha's power to speak.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a11_19']	又解：	又解：	02a	Another explanation:
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a12_14']	前三願是勝鬘自力能辨，不假佛威；	前三願是勝鬘自力能辨，不假佛威；	02a	The first three vows are what Śrīmālā can accomplish by her own power, without relying on the Buddha's majesty;
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a14_5']	今欲說上地深法，非己分力所能，要假如來神力加被然後得說也。	今欲說上地深法，非己分力所能，要假如來神力加被然後得說也。	02a	Now, wishing to speak of the profound Dharma of the higher grounds, which is not within her own power, she must rely on the Tathāgata's spiritual power to be able to speak.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a14_7']	問：	問：	02a	Question:
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a14_17']	佛既有力，何不自說？	佛既有力，何不自說？	02a	If the Buddha already has the power, why does he not speak himself?
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a15_10']	勝鬘無力，承於佛力而欲說耶？	勝鬘無力，承於佛力而欲說耶？	02a	Does Śrīmālā have no power, and does she want to speak by relying on the Buddha's power?
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a15_12']	答：	答：	02a	Answer:
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a15_17']	凡有二義。	凡有二義。	02a	There are generally two meanings.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a17_8']	一者勝鬘當今教主，機屬在其人、不屬在佛，故無力而說、有力不說。	一者勝鬘當今教主，機屬在其人、不屬在佛，故無力而說、有力不說。	02a	First, Śrīmālā is now the teacher. The capacity belongs to her, not to the Buddha. Therefore, she has no power to speak, and one with power does not speak.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a19_8']	二者眾生若聞佛自說者，則謂法是甚深唯佛能說，則唯佛能知非我所解，則便自絕。	二者眾生若聞佛自說者，則謂法是甚深唯佛能說，則唯佛能知非我所解，則便自絕。	02a	Second, if sentient beings hear the Buddha speaking himself, they will think that the Dharma is very profound and only the Buddha can speak it. Then only the Buddha can understand it, not what I can comprehend, and they will then cut themselves off.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a20_7']	以今勝鬘承佛神力能說，則我亦同然。	以今勝鬘承佛神力能說，則我亦同然。	02a	Now that Śrīmālā can speak by relying on the Buddha's spiritual power, then I am also the same.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a20_14']	故須勝鬘說也。	故須勝鬘說也。	02a	Therefore, Śrīmālā must speak.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a21_12', 'ZH_T37_1744_02a:0028a22_10']	此與《地經》金剛藏說增菩薩力，其義大同。🔽又勝鬘欲令聽眾生信，故言承佛神力。	此與《地經》金剛藏說增菩薩力，其義大同。 又勝鬘欲令聽眾生信，故言承佛神力。	02a	This is largely the same as Vajragarbha's explanation in the Treatise on the Stages of Yoga Practice to increase the power of bodhisattvas.🔽Moreover, Śrīmālā wants to make the audience give rise to faith, so she says she relies on the Buddha's spiritual power.

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0041c03_17']	如《法華》前三乘教意，佛於三乘教中若說三乘眾生空，即說無三人，即密說三人同歸一乘。	如《法華》前三乘教意，佛於三乘教中若說三乘眾生空，即說無三人，即密說三人同歸一乘。	02a	As for the meaning of the teachings of the three vehicles in the Lotus Sutra, if the Buddha speaks of the emptiness of the three vehicles' sentient beings within the teachings of the three vehicles, he then speaks of the non-existence of the three persons, thus secretly speaking of the three persons' common return to the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0041c05_4']	又昔於三乘法中說三乘法空，亦是密說三乘法同歸一乘。	又昔於三乘法中說三乘法空，亦是密說三乘法同歸一乘。	02a	Moreover, in the past, within the teachings of the three vehicles, speaking of the emptiness of the three vehicles' dharmas is also the secret speaking of the three vehicles' dharmas' common return to the One Vehicle.

Although they study the Mahāyāna, when they hear the teaching of the three vehicles, their minds still waver, thinking either of advancing to become bodhisattvas or of retreating to become śrāvakas. Therefore, it is taught that there is one and not two. Because there is no two, there is no retreating. Because there is one, there is only advancing. It is for this kind of bodhisattva that the One Vehicle is taught.

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0041c18_2']	故《法華》云「佛昔於菩薩前毀呰聲聞樂小法者，然佛實以大乘教化。	故《法華》云「佛昔於菩薩前毀呰聲聞樂小法者，然佛實以大乘教化。	02a	Therefore, the Lotus Sutra says, The Buddha formerly in front of the bodhisattvas reviled the śrāvakas who delight in the small teaching, but the Buddha truly teaches and transforms with the Great Vehicle.

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0042a19_4']	所以命說者，以前善說攝受正法，深稱聖心，如來讚述，因即勸之說於一乘。	所以命說者，以前善說攝受正法，深稱聖心，如來讚述，因即勸之說於一乘。	02a	The reason for the command to speak is because the previous good explanation of the acceptance of the true Dharma deeply matched the holy mind, and the Tathāgata praised it, and then encouraged her to speak of the One Vehicle.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0042a20_8']	又復一乘是佛果德，懼彼勝鬘不敢宣說，故命令說。	又復一乘是佛果德，懼彼勝鬘不敢宣說，故命令說。	02a	Moreover, the One Vehicle is the fruition virtues of the Buddha. Fearing that Śrīmālā would not dare to proclaim it, he commanded her to speak.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0042a21_9']	又前請事多，不敢復請更有所說，須命乃說。	又前請事多，不敢復請更有所說，須命乃說。	02a	Furthermore, she had already requested many things before and did not dare to request to speak again. She needed to be commanded before she would speak.

['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0042a24_2']	以攝受即一乘，故仍前名命其說。	以攝受即一乘，故仍前名命其說。	02a	Because the acceptance is precisely the One Vehicle, it still uses the previous name to command her to speak.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0042a25_15']	前已說竟今更說者，以攝受有二義，前雖明出生、未辨收入，故云更說。	前已說竟今更說者，以攝受有二義，前雖明出生、未辨收入，故云更說。	02a	Although it has already been explained, it is explained again now, because there are two meanings of embracing. Although the previous chapter clarified giving birth, it did not discuss taking in, so it says explained again.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0042a27_6']	又上已說攝受德行廣大，今欲令其說此行德顯異二乘，故言更說。	又上已說攝受德行廣大，今欲令其說此行德顯異二乘，故言更說。	02a	Moreover, the previous chapter has already explained the vastness of the virtues and practices of embracing, and now it wants to make the explanation of these virtues and practices appear different from the two vehicles, so it says explained again.
['ZH_T37_1744_02a:0042a28_12']	所說攝受，乃是十方三世諸佛同說，故言更說諸佛所說也。	所說攝受，乃是十方三世諸佛同說，故言更說諸佛所說也。	02a	The explanation of embracing is precisely what the Buddhas of the ten directions and three periods all explain together, so it says explained again, what is explained by all Buddhas.
