['ZH_T31_1585_009:0047c24_17']	若有三性，如何世尊說一切法皆無自性？	若有三性，如何世尊說一切法皆無自性？	If there are three natures, how is it that the World-Honored One says that all dharmas are without self-nature?

['ZH_T31_1585_009:0047c28_0']	２４初即相無性，　　次無自然性，	２４初即相無性，　　次無自然性，	The next is without the nature of arising by itself,

['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a05_10']	即依此前所說三性，立彼後說三種無性，謂即相、生、勝義無性，故佛密意說一切法皆無自性，非性全無。	即依此前所說三性，立彼後說三種無性，謂即相、生、勝義無性，故佛密意說一切法皆無自性，非性全無。	It is precisely based on the previously explained three natures to establish those subsequently explained three kinds of naturelessness, namely, the naturelessness of characteristics, arising, and the ultimate. Therefore the Buddha secretly intends to say that all dharmas are without self-nature, but it is not that natures are completely nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a08_2']	說密意言，顯非了義，謂後二性雖體非無，而有愚夫於彼增益妄執實有我法自性，此即名為遍計所執。	說密意言，顯非了義，謂後二性雖體非無，而有愚夫於彼增益妄執實有我法自性，此即名為遍計所執。	The Buddha’s words are said to be of implicit meaning and not explicit meaning, because although the last two natures are not nonexistent, there is a class of foolish people who superimpose upon them the false notion that they are the natures of real selves and dharmas. This is called the imagined nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a09_3']	為除此執，故佛世尊於有及無總說無性。	為除此執，故佛世尊於有及無總說無性。	In order to eliminate this false notion, the Buddha taught in a general way that both existence and nonexistence are natureless.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a09_12']	云何依此而立彼三？	云何依此而立彼三？	How are the three kinds of naturelessness established on the basis of the three natures?
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a11_3']	謂依此初遍計所執立相無性，由此體相畢竟非有，如空華故。	謂依此初遍計所執立相無性，由此體相畢竟非有，如空華故。	The first, imagined nature, is established as natureless in terms of characteristics, because its characteristics are absolutely nonexistent, like the horns of a rabbit.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a13_5']	依次依他立生無性，此如幻事託眾緣生，無如妄執自然性故，假說無性非性全無。	依次依他立生無性，此如幻事託眾緣生，無如妄執自然性故，假說無性非性全無。	The second, dependent on others, is established as natureless in terms of production, because it is produced by conditions in the same way that a magician’s tricks are produced by conditions, and because it does not have a nature of its own as falsely imagined. It is said to be natureless, but it is not that it is totally nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a16_7']	依後圓成實立勝義無性，謂即勝義由遠離前遍計所執我法性故，假說無性，非性全無，如太虛空雖遍眾色而是眾色無性所顯。	依後圓成實立勝義無性，謂即勝義由遠離前遍計所執我法性故，假說無性，非性全無，如太虛空雖遍眾色而是眾色無性所顯。	The third, the perfected, is established as natureless in terms of the ultimate truth, because it is the ultimate truth and is by nature far removed from the self and dharmas imagined above. It is said to be natureless, but it is not that it is totally nonexistent, just as space, although it is the absence of form, is not nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a17_16']	雖依他起非勝義故，亦得說為勝義無性，而濫第二故此不說。	雖依他起非勝義故，亦得說為勝義無性，而濫第二故此不說。	Although the dependent on others is not the ultimate truth, it is said to be the nature that is the ultimate truth, but this is not mentioned here because it would be confused with the second nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a18_16']	此性即是諸法勝義，是一切法勝義諦故。	此性即是諸法勝義，是一切法勝義諦故。	This nature is the ultimate truth of dharmas, because it is the truth of ultimate truth of all dharmas.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a19_6']	然勝義諦略有四種：	然勝義諦略有四種：	There are, however, four kinds of ultimate truth in brief:
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a19_18']	一世間勝義，謂蘊處界等；	一世間勝義，謂蘊處界等；	1) mundane ultimate truth, i.e., the aggregates, sense bases, sense fields, etc.;
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a20_11']	二道理勝義，謂苦等四諦；	二道理勝義，謂苦等四諦；	2) ultimate truth as principle, i.e., the four holy truths of suffering, etc.;
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a21_3']	三證得勝義，謂二空真如；	三證得勝義，謂二空真如；	3) ultimate truth as attainment, i.e., the two kinds of emptiness and suchness;
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a21_15']	四勝義勝義，謂一真法界。	四勝義勝義，謂一真法界。	4) ultimate truth as ultimate truth, i.e., the one true Dharma realm.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a22_13']	此中勝義依最後說，是最勝道所行義故。	此中勝義依最後說，是最勝道所行義故。	Here, ultimate truth is based on the last of these, because it is the meaning practiced by the most excellent path.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a26_4']	為簡前三故作是說，此諸法勝義亦即是真如，真謂真實顯非虛妄，如謂如常表無變易，謂此真實於一切位常如其性故曰真如，即是湛然不虛妄義。	為簡前三故作是說，此諸法勝義亦即是真如，真謂真實顯非虛妄，如謂如常表無變易，謂此真實於一切位常如其性故曰真如，即是湛然不虛妄義。	In order to distinguish it from the first three, this is said. This ultimate truth of dharmas is also suchness. Suchness is said to be true, which manifests as not false, and as such, which indicates as unchanging. It is said to be suchness because it is always, in all states, the nature of suchness, which is the meaning of being calm and not false.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a27_13']	亦言顯此復有多名，謂名法界及實際等，如餘論中隨義廣釋。	亦言顯此復有多名，謂名法界及實際等，如餘論中隨義廣釋。	The word also indicates that it has many other names, such as the realm of the Dharma, the ultimate reality, etc., as explained in other treatises.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a28_12']	此性即是唯識實性，謂唯識性略有二種：	此性即是唯識實性，謂唯識性略有二種：	This nature is the true nature of consciousness only. The nature of consciousness only is of two kinds:
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a29_3']	一者虛妄，謂遍計所執；	一者虛妄，謂遍計所執；	one is false, which is the imagined nature;
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048a29_14']	二者真實，謂圓成實性。	二者真實，謂圓成實性。	the other is real, which is the perfected nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b01_4']	為簡虛妄，說實性言。	為簡虛妄，說實性言。	In order to distinguish it from the false, the words true nature are used.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b01_9']	復有二性：	復有二性：	There are two other natures:
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b01_19']	一者世俗，謂依他起；	一者世俗，謂依他起；	one is conventional, which is the dependent on others nature;
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b02_9']	二者勝義，謂圓成實。	二者勝義，謂圓成實。	the other is ultimate, which is the perfected nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b03_1']	為簡世俗，故說實性。	為簡世俗，故說實性。	In order to distinguish it from the conventional, it is called the true nature.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b04_16']	三頌總顯諸契經中說無性言非極了義，諸有智者不應依之總撥諸法都無自性。	三頌總顯諸契經中說無性言非極了義，諸有智者不應依之總撥諸法都無自性。	These three verses in summary show that the statements in the scriptures about the absence of natures are not the ultimate truth, and the wise should not rely on them to deny in a general way that all dharmas are devoid of self-natures.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b05_17']	如是所成唯識相性，誰於幾位如何悟入？	如是所成唯識相性，誰於幾位如何悟入？	In what states and how do those who are provided with the two lineages of the Mahayana gradually penetrate the characteristics and natures of consciousness only that have been established above?
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b06_16']	謂具大乘二種姓者，略於五位漸次悟入。	謂具大乘二種姓者，略於五位漸次悟入。	Those who are provided with the two lineages of the Mahayana gradually penetrate in five states.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b07_7']	何謂大乘二種種姓？	何謂大乘二種種姓？	What are the two kinds of great vehicle lineages?
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b08_12']	一本性住種姓，謂無始來依附本識法爾所得無漏法因；	一本性住種姓，謂無始來依附本識法爾所得無漏法因；	The first is the naturally abiding lineage, which refers to the cause of the uncontaminated dharmas that one obtains from beginningless time by relying on the fundamental consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b10_1']	二習所成種姓，謂聞法界等流法已，聞所成等熏習所成。	二習所成種姓，謂聞法界等流法已，聞所成等熏習所成。	The second is the lineage that is cultivated, which refers to that which is accomplished by the perfuming of hearing the dharmas that flow out of the Dharma realm.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b11_1']	要具大乘此二種姓，方能漸次悟入唯識。	要具大乘此二種姓，方能漸次悟入唯識。	One must possess these two kinds of great vehicle lineages in order to gradually realize consciousness only.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b11_10']	何謂悟入唯識五位？	何謂悟入唯識五位？	What are the five stages of realizing consciousness only?
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b12_5']	一資糧位，謂修大乘順解脫分；	一資糧位，謂修大乘順解脫分；	The first is the stage of equipment, which refers to the cultivation of the aids to liberation of the great vehicle.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b12_19']	二加行位，謂修大乘順決擇分；	二加行位，謂修大乘順決擇分；	The second is the stage of added effort, which refers to the cultivation of the aids to penetration of the great vehicle.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b13_13']	三通達位，謂諸菩薩所住見道；	三通達位，謂諸菩薩所住見道；	The third is the stage of thorough understanding, which refers to the path of insight in which the bodhisattva abides.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b14_7']	四修習位，謂諸菩薩所住修道；	四修習位，謂諸菩薩所住修道；	The fourth is the stage of cultivation, which refers to the path of cultivation in which the bodhisattva abides.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b15_2']	五究竟位，謂住無上正等菩提。	五究竟位，謂住無上正等菩提。	The fifth is the stage of culmination, which refers to abiding in supreme perfect enlightenment.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b15_11']	云何漸次悟入唯識？	云何漸次悟入唯識？	How does one gradually realize consciousness only?
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b20_10']	謂諸菩薩於識相性資糧位中能深信解，在加行位能漸伏除所取能取引發真見，在通達位如實通達，修習位中如所見理數數修習伏斷餘障，至究竟位出障圓明，能盡未來化有情類復令悟入唯識相性。	謂諸菩薩於識相性資糧位中能深信解，在加行位能漸伏除所取能取引發真見，在通達位如實通達，修習位中如所見理數數修習伏斷餘障，至究竟位出障圓明，能盡未來化有情類復令悟入唯識相性。	That is, bodhisattvas in the stage of equipment are able to believe and understand the nature and characteristics of consciousness only, in the stage of added effort they are able to gradually subdue the grasped and the grasper and induce the true view, in the stage of insight they thoroughly penetrate reality as it truly is, in the stage of cultivation they cultivate repeatedly the principles they have seen and subdue the remaining obstacles, and in the stage of culmination they emerge from the obstacles and perfect their understanding and are able to exhaust the future and transform the various kinds of sentient beings and cause them to realize and enter consciousness only and its nature and characteristics.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b21_1']	初資糧位其相云何？	初資糧位其相云何？	What are the characteristics of the stage of equipment?
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b21_4']	頌曰：	頌曰：	A verse says:
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b22_0']	２６乃至未起識，　　求住唯識性，	２６乃至未起識，　　求住唯識性，	Seeking to abide in the nature of consciousness only,
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b23_13']	於二取隨眠，　　猶未能伏滅。	於二取隨眠，　　猶未能伏滅。	Still unable to subdue the propensities of the two graspings.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b24_2']	論曰：	論曰：	The treatise says:
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b26_2']	從發深固大菩提心，乃至未起順決擇識，求住唯識真勝義性，齊此皆是資糧位攝。	從發深固大菩提心，乃至未起順決擇識，求住唯識真勝義性，齊此皆是資糧位攝。	From the time of generating the profound, firm, great thought of enlightenment until the time of generating the consciousnesses that conform to discernment, seeking to abide in the true ultimate reality of consciousness only, all this is included in the stage of equipment.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048b28_2']	為趣無上正等菩提，修習種種勝資糧故，為有情故勤求解脫，由此亦名順解脫分。	為趣無上正等菩提，修習種種勝資糧故，為有情故勤求解脫，由此亦名順解脫分。	In order to cultivate various kinds of superior provisions for the sake of supreme perfect enlightenment, and in order to seek liberation for the sake of sentient beings, this stage is also called the stage of the factors that contribute to liberation.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c03_1']	此位菩薩依因善友作意資糧四勝力故，於唯識義雖深信解，而未能了能所取空，多住外門修菩薩行，故於二取所引隨眠猶未有能伏滅功力令彼不起二取現行。	此位菩薩依因善友作意資糧四勝力故，於唯識義雖深信解，而未能了能所取空，多住外門修菩薩行，故於二取所引隨眠猶未有能伏滅功力令彼不起二取現行。	Even though the bodhisattva of this stage has deep faith and understanding of the meaning of consciousness only on the basis of the four powers of causes, good friends, attention, and provisions, he still is not able to understand the emptiness of the grasped and grasper, and he dwells mostly in the external practices of a bodhisattva. Therefore, he is still not able to subdue the propensities of the two graspings that are drawn out by the two graspings and prevent them from generating the actual mode of the two graspings.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c04_1']	此二取言顯二取取，執取能取所取性故。	此二取言顯二取取，執取能取所取性故。	The words TWO GRASPINGS indicate the two graspings of the two graspings, because they grasp the natures of the grasper and the grasped.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c05_19']	二取習氣名彼隨眠，隨逐有情眠伏藏識，或隨增過故名隨眠，即是所知煩惱障種。	二取習氣名彼隨眠，隨逐有情眠伏藏識，或隨增過故名隨眠，即是所知煩惱障種。	The HABIT ENERGY of the two graspings is called THEIR PROPENsities. They follow sentient beings and lie hidden in store consciousness, or they are called propensities because they increase faults. They are seeds of the obstacle to that which is to be known and the obstacle of the passions.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c09_2']	煩惱障者，謂執遍計所執實我薩迦耶見而為上首百二十八根本煩惱，及彼等流諸隨煩惱，此皆擾惱有情身心，能障涅槃，名煩惱障。	煩惱障者，謂執遍計所執實我薩迦耶見而為上首百二十八根本煩惱，及彼等流諸隨煩惱，此皆擾惱有情身心，能障涅槃，名煩惱障。	The obstacle of the passions is made up of the one hundred and twenty-eight fundamental passions and their numerous secondary passions, with the false view of a self as their head. These passions disturb the body and mind of sentient beings and obstruct nirvāṇa. They are called the obstacle of the passions.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c11_14']	所知障者，謂執遍計所執實法薩迦耶見而為上首見疑無明愛恚慢等，覆所知境無顛倒性，能障菩提，名所知障。	所知障者，謂執遍計所執實法薩迦耶見而為上首見疑無明愛恚慢等，覆所知境無顛倒性，能障菩提，名所知障。	The obstacle to that which is to be known is made up of the false views of a self and dharmas as their head, along with the passions of doubt, ignorance, craving, hatred, pride, etc., that cover the nonerroneous nature of the knowable and obstruct bodhi. They are called the obstacle to that which is to be known.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c13_13']	此所知障決定不與異熟識俱，彼微劣故，不與無明慧相應故，法空智品與俱起故。	此所知障決定不與異熟識俱，彼微劣故，不與無明慧相應故，法空智品與俱起故。	This obstacle to that which is to be known is definitely not associated with the eighth consciousness, because it is weak and not associated with ignorance and wisdom, and because the class of knowledge of the emptiness of the person is already present.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c14_12']	七轉識內隨其所應，或少或多如煩惱說。	七轉識內隨其所應，或少或多如煩惱說。	As for the seven evolving consciousnesses, there are some that are associated with passions, as explained above, and some that are not.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c16_2']	眼等五識無分別故，法見疑等定不相應，餘由意力皆容引起。	眼等五識無分別故，法見疑等定不相應，餘由意力皆容引起。	The first five consciousnesses are devoid of imagination and therefore are definitely not associated with false views, doubt, etc., but the others are aroused by the power of manas.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c18_1']	此障但與不善無記二心相應，論說無明唯通不善無記性故，癡無癡等不相應故。	此障但與不善無記二心相應，論說無明唯通不善無記性故，癡無癡等不相應故。	This obstacle is only associated with the two kinds of minds, good and indeterminate, because a treatise says that ignorance is only of the natures of being good and indeterminate, and because it is not associated with delusion and nondelusion, etc.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c19_1']	煩惱障中此障必有，彼定用此為所依故。	煩惱障中此障必有，彼定用此為所依故。	This obstacle must exist in the obstacle of the passions, because it definitely uses the former as a support.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c20_9']	體雖無異而用有別，故二隨眠隨聖道用有勝有劣斷惑前後。	體雖無異而用有別，故二隨眠隨聖道用有勝有劣斷惑前後。	Although there is no difference in substance, there is a difference in function. Therefore, the two propensities are superior or inferior according to the function of the holy paths, and the passions are eliminated either earlier or later.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c22_8']	此於無覆無記性中是異熟生，非餘三種，彼威儀等勢用薄弱，非覆所知障菩提故。	此於無覆無記性中是異熟生，非餘三種，彼威儀等勢用薄弱，非覆所知障菩提故。	This obstacle is born of retribution among the indeterminate dharmas that are not karmic results, and not the other three kinds. The latter, such as the category of deportment, are weak in power and do not conceal knowledge and obstruct bodhi.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c23_1']	此名無覆，望二乘說；	此名無覆，望二乘說；	This obstacle is called nondefiled, from the point of view of the two vehicles.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c23_11']	若望菩薩，亦是有覆。	若望菩薩，亦是有覆。	If we consider the bodhisattvas, it is also defiled.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c24_14']	若所知障有見疑等，如何此種契經說為無明住地？	若所知障有見疑等，如何此種契經說為無明住地？	If the obstacle to that which is to be known has views, doubt, etc., why does a scripture say that its seeds are the stage of nescience?
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c26_17']	無明增故總名無明，非無見等，如煩惱種立見一處，欲色有愛四住地名，豈彼更無慢無明等？	無明增故總名無明，非無見等，如煩惱種立見一處，欲色有愛四住地名，豈彼更無慢無明等？	Because ignorance increases, they are all called ignorance, but this is not to say that views and so on are absent, just as the seeds of the passions are classified as the one place called views, and the four stages of the propensities of desire, form, and formlessness and of the passion for the holy life are called attachment, but this is not to say that pride, ignorance, and so on are absent.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c28_2']	如是二障，分別起者見所斷攝，任運起者修所斷攝。	如是二障，分別起者見所斷攝，任運起者修所斷攝。	As for these two obstacles, that which is produced by discrimination is categorized as being eliminated by the path of insight, and that which is produced spontaneously is categorized as being eliminated by the path of cultivation.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0048c29_14']	二乘但能斷煩惱障，菩薩俱斷永斷二種，唯聖道能伏二現行通有漏道。	二乘但能斷煩惱障，菩薩俱斷永斷二種，唯聖道能伏二現行通有漏道。	The two vehicles are only able to eliminate the obstacle of the passions, while bodhisattvas eliminate both eternally.

Because of this, the passions are not aware of their activity.

In order to eliminate this, one produces the path of liberation and realizes the cessation that is a nonengendering of that class.

It is like the elimination of the faculty of suffering when one enters the second samādhi. Although the faculty of suffering that is eliminated is neither the present nor the seeds, it is called coarseness. This is also so.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c10_3']	後麁重言例此應釋。	後麁重言例此應釋。	The later word coarseness should be explained by analogy with this.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c12_5']	雖初地所斷實通二障，而異生性障意取所知，說十無明非染污故，無明即是十障品愚。	雖初地所斷實通二障，而異生性障意取所知，說十無明非染污故，無明即是十障品愚。	Although the elimination in the first stage actually penetrates both obstacles, the nature of ordinary beings is taken as the obstacle of the knowable, because it is said that the ten kinds of ignorance are not defiled. Ignorance is precisely the delusion in the class of the ten obstacles.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c13_4']	二乘亦能斷煩惱障，彼是共故非此所說。	二乘亦能斷煩惱障，彼是共故非此所說。	The two vehicles are also able to eliminate the obstacle of the passions, but because that is common to both vehicles, it is not mentioned here.

['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c15_14']	雖此位中亦伏煩惱斷彼麁重而非正意，不斷隨眠，故此不說。	雖此位中亦伏煩惱斷彼麁重而非正意，不斷隨眠，故此不說。	Even though in this stage one also subdues the passions and eliminates their grossness, this is not the main point, and one does not eliminate the propensities, and therefore this is not mentioned.

The elimination in the following nine stages should be understood in accordance with this.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c19_2']	住滿地中時既淹久，理應進斷所應斷障，不爾三時道應無別。	住滿地中時既淹久，理應進斷所應斷障，不爾三時道應無別。	When one dwells in a perfected stage for a long time, one must eliminate the obstacles that are to be eliminated. If it were not so, the three periods of the path would be without distinction.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c22_10']	故說菩薩得現觀已，復於十地修道位中唯修永滅所知障道，留煩惱障助願受生，非如二乘速趣圓寂，故修道位不斷煩惱將成佛時方頓斷故。	故說菩薩得現觀已，復於十地修道位中唯修永滅所知障道，留煩惱障助願受生，非如二乘速趣圓寂，故修道位不斷煩惱將成佛時方頓斷故。	Therefore it is said that when the bodhisattva has attained discernment, he then in the stage of the path of cultivation of the ten stages cultivates only the path that eternally eliminates the obstacle to that which is to be known. He retains the obstacle of the passions and, with the aid of vows, takes on birth. He is not like those of the two vehicles who quickly enter complete quiescence. Therefore, in the stage of the path of cultivation, he does not eliminate the passions, because he will suddenly eliminate them at the time of becoming a Buddha.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c23_15']	二邪行障，謂所知障中俱生一分及彼所起悞犯三業。	二邪行障，謂所知障中俱生一分及彼所起悞犯三業。	The second is the obstacle of false action, which is a part of the obstacle of the knowable that is innate and the three actions of body, speech, and mind that are erroneously transgressed that are generated by it.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c24_15']	彼障二地極淨尸羅，入二地時便能永斷。	彼障二地極淨尸羅，入二地時便能永斷。	That obstacle is to the extreme purity of morality of the second stage. Upon entry into the second stage, it is eternally eliminated.

['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c26_7']	一微細悞犯愚，即是此中俱生一分；	一微細悞犯愚，即是此中俱生一分；	The first is the delusion of subtle transgressions, which is a part of the innate nature of the second delusion.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0052c27_13']	二種種業趣愚，即彼所起悞犯三業，或唯起業不了業愚。	二種種業趣愚，即彼所起悞犯三業，或唯起業不了業愚。	The second is the delusion of the various destinies of action, which is the three actions of transgression that are produced by the second delusion, or it is the delusion that produces action but does not understand action.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a01_7']	三闇鈍障，謂所知障中俱生一分令所聞思修法忘失，彼障三地勝定總持及彼所發殊勝三慧，入三地時便能永斷。	三闇鈍障，謂所知障中俱生一分令所聞思修法忘失，彼障三地勝定總持及彼所發殊勝三慧，入三地時便能永斷。	The third is the obstacle of dullness, which is a part of the innate nature of the obstacle to that which is to be known that causes one to forget the teachings that are heard, contemplated, and cultivated. It obstructs the superior samādhi, dhāraṇī, and the special three discernments that are generated by them of the third stage. Upon entry into the third stage, it is eternally eliminated.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a02_3']	由斯三地說斷二愚及彼麁重：	由斯三地說斷二愚及彼麁重：	Consequently, the third stage is said to eliminate two delusions and their coarseness.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a05_5']	一欲貪愚，即是此中能障勝定及修慧者，彼昔多與欲貪俱故名欲貪愚，今得勝定及修所成，彼既永斷欲貪隨伏，此無始來依彼轉故；	一欲貪愚，即是此中能障勝定及修慧者，彼昔多與欲貪俱故名欲貪愚，今得勝定及修所成，彼既永斷欲貪隨伏，此無始來依彼轉故；	The first is the delusion of desire and greed, which is the part of the obstacle to that which is to be known that is innate that obstructs superior samādhi and the discernment that is cultivated. It is called the delusion of desire and greed because it is associated with desire and greed in the past. Now, upon acquiring superior samādhi and the discernment that is cultivated, it is eternally eliminated. Desire and greed are subdued because they have always evolved supported by it.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a06_9']	二圓滿聞持陀羅尼愚，即是此中能障總持聞思慧者。	二圓滿聞持陀羅尼愚，即是此中能障總持聞思慧者。	The second, the ignorance of perfect retention of what one has heard, is that which in this treatise is said to obstruct the retention of what one has heard and reflection on it.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a09_2']	四微細煩惱現行障，謂所知障中俱生一分第六識俱身見等攝，最下品故，不作意緣故，遠隨現行故，說名微細。	四微細煩惱現行障，謂所知障中俱生一分第六識俱身見等攝，最下品故，不作意緣故，遠隨現行故，說名微細。	The fourth is the obstacle of the manifestation of the subtle propensities of the passions, that is, a part of the obstacle to that which is to be known that is innate that is included in the view of a self, etc., associated with the sixth consciousness. It is called subtle because it is the lowest grade of passions, because it is not aroused by attention, and because it has been active from long ago.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a10_2']	彼障四地菩提分法，入四地時便能永斷。	彼障四地菩提分法，入四地時便能永斷。	It obstructs the factors that contribute to enlightenment in the fourth stage. Upon entry into the fourth stage, it is eternally eliminated.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a11_9']	彼昔多與第六識中任運而生執我見等同體起故說煩惱名。	彼昔多與第六識中任運而生執我見等同體起故說煩惱名。	It is said to be a passion because it has long been associated with the view of a self, etc., that arises spontaneously in the sixth consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a12_19']	今四地中既得無漏菩提分法，彼便永滅，此我見等亦永不行。	今四地中既得無漏菩提分法，彼便永滅，此我見等亦永不行。	Now, in the fourth stage, since one has attained the pure factors that contribute to enlightenment, it is eternally eliminated, and the view of a self, etc., are also eternally inactive.
['ZH_T31_1585_009:0053a14_17']	初二三地行施戒修相同世間，四地修得菩提分法方名出世，故能永害二身見等。	初二三地行施戒修相同世間，四地修得菩提分法方名出世，故能永害二身見等。	In the first, second, and third stages, the practice of giving, morality, and cultivation is the same as that of the worldly man. In the fourth stage, one cultivates and attains the factors that contribute to enlightenment, which are then called supramundane, and therefore one is able eternally to destroy the two kinds of views of a self, etc.
