['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101a26_4']	既得住立，故修行萬行，所以次問修行。	既得住立，故修行萬行，所以次問修行。	002	Since one has already attained abiding, one then practices the myriad practices, so the next question asks about practice.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b02_9']	然佛歎善吉者，良由善吉歎得時宜、問復會道，故佛歎之。	然佛歎善吉者，良由善吉歎得時宜、問復會道，故佛歎之。	002	The reason the Buddha praises Subhuti is because Subhuti's praise is timely and his question accords with the Way, so the Buddha praises him.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b03_15']	又善吉是聲聞人，今遂能問菩薩事，此為希有，故復歎之。	又善吉是聲聞人，今遂能問菩薩事，此為希有，故復歎之。	002	Moreover, Subhuti is a Shravaka, yet he is now able to ask about Bodhisattva matters, which is rare, so the Buddha praises him again.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b05_6']	又時會恐菩薩道深，小乘智淺，問容僻謬，故印歎之，令眾尊人重法也。	又時會恐菩薩道深，小乘智淺，問容僻謬，故印歎之，令眾尊人重法也。	002	Furthermore, the assembly may fear that the Bodhisattva Way is profound and the wisdom of the Lesser Vehicle is shallow, and the question may be biased and erroneous, so the Buddha seals and praises it, causing the assembly to respect the person and revere the Dharma.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b06_2']	「汝今諦聽」下，此第二句許答其問。	「汝今諦聽」下，此第二句許答其問。	002	Now listen attentively is the second sentence promising to answer the question.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b11_8']	自下一切修多羅中斷生疑心。	自下一切修多羅中斷生疑心。	002	From here on, all the sūtras resolve doubts that arise.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b15_5']	明此三者，既稱般若波羅蜜經，故前明般若體；	明此三者，既稱般若波羅蜜經，故前明般若體；	002	As this is called the Prajnaparamita Sutra, the essence of prajna is clarified first;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b16_5']	既明般若體竟，必有信受人，故次明信受門；	既明般若體竟，必有信受人，故次明信受門；	002	Having clarified the essence of prajna, there must be people who believe and accept it, so the gate of belief and acceptance is clarified next;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b17_1']	信持則獲福無盡，故次明格量門。	信持則獲福無盡，故次明格量門。	002	If one believes and upholds it, one will obtain inexhaustible blessings, so the gate of evaluation is clarified next.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b17_15']	又前就因果說般若，即是法門；	又前就因果說般若，即是法門；	002	Moreover, the previous explanation of prajna in terms of cause and effect is the Dharma gate;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b18_9']	次就信受門說般若，即是人門；	次就信受門說般若，即是人門；	002	Next, the explanation of prajna in terms of the gate of belief and acceptance is the gate of people;

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b19_15']	就前門為二：	就前門為二：	002	In the previous gate, there are two parts:
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b20_6']	一、答其四問，即明因門；	一、答其四問，即明因門；	002	First, answering the four questions clarifies the gate of causes;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b20_17']	二、斷眾疑，次辨果門。	二、斷眾疑，次辨果門。	002	Second, resolving doubts, next clarifies the gate of effects.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b22_8']	因即無依無住，果則無相無為，般若未曾因果，為眾生故，故作因果名說。	因即無依無住，果則無相無為，般若未曾因果，為眾生故，故作因果名說。	002	Causes are non-dependent and non-abiding, and effects are signless and unconditioned. Prajna is originally neither cause nor effect. For the sake of sentient beings, it is taught using the names of cause and effect.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b24_7']	就明因門答其四問，唯有兩章經文，由來舊釋初章經非答菩提心門，乃是答降伏心問；	就明因門答其四問，唯有兩章經文，由來舊釋初章經非答菩提心門，乃是答降伏心問；	002	In the section on clarifying the causes, there are only two chapters of sutra text to answer the four questions. The old explanations say that the first chapter of sutra is not an answer to the question on the gate of the bodhi mind, but rather an answer to the question on subduing the mind;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b24_15']	次章經答其住問；	次章經答其住問；	002	The next chapter of sutra answers the question on abiding;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b25_6']	後舉佛果答菩提心問。	後舉佛果答菩提心問。	002	And the Buddha's fruition is mentioned to answer the question on the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b25_12']	北地論師云：	北地論師云：	002	The Northern school masters say:
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b26_5']	初答其住問，不答菩提心問。	初答其住問，不答菩提心問。	002	The first answers the question on abiding, but does not answer the question on the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101b27_19']	今謂并不然，若言此中遍度四生，非答菩提心問者，汝復以何法名菩提心？	今謂并不然，若言此中遍度四生，非答菩提心問者，汝復以何法名菩提心？	002	I now say that is also not so. If it is said that the all-pervading liberation of the four kinds of birth in this section is not an answer to the question on the bodhi mind, then by what method do you call it the bodhi mind?
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c02_4']	又下第二周中善吉更發三問，佛答發菩提心者當生如是心，滅度一切眾生而無滅度，此即是牒菩提心問而解釋之，云何言非答菩提心耶？	又下第二周中善吉更發三問，佛答發菩提心者當生如是心，滅度一切眾生而無滅度，此即是牒菩提心問而解釋之，云何言非答菩提心耶？	002	Moreover, in the second round below, Subhūti again asks three questions. The Buddha answers, One who gives rise to the bodhi mind should give rise to such a mind, to liberate all beings while there is no liberation. This is precisely a restatement of the question on the bodhi mind and an explanation of it. How can it be said that it is not an answer to the question on the bodhi mind?
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c02_16']	今明經雖兩章，共酬四問：	今明經雖兩章，共酬四問：	002	Now it is clarified that although the sutra has two chapters, they together answer the four questions:
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c03_12']	初一章經答住問，即是答菩提心問；	初一章經答住問，即是答菩提心問；	002	The first chapter of the sutra answers the question of abiding, which is the answer to the question of the mind of enlightenment;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c04_11']	次一章經答修行問，即是答降伏心問也。	次一章經答修行問，即是答降伏心問也。	002	The next chapter of the sutra answers the question of practice, which is the answer to the question of the mind of subjugation.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c05_7']	云何答其住問，即是答菩提心耶？	云何答其住問，即是答菩提心耶？	002	How does answering the question of abiding answer the question of the mind of enlightenment?
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c05_10']	解云：	解云：	002	Explanation:
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c06_3']	由發菩提心故，得住大乘法。	由發菩提心故，得住大乘法。	002	Because one gives rise to the mind of enlightenment, one can abide in the Dharma of the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c06_16']	若不發菩提心，則不住大乘。	若不發菩提心，則不住大乘。	002	If one does not give rise to the mind of enlightenment, then one does not abide in the Great Vehicle.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c07_12']	故論云「利益深心住，此乘功德滿。	故論云「利益深心住，此乘功德滿。	002	Therefore the treatise says: Abiding in the profound mind of benefiting, the merit of this vehicle is fulfilled.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c08_17']	第一、對於善吉總勸菩薩發菩提心；	第一、對於善吉總勸菩薩發菩提心；	002	The first is exhorting bodhisattvas to give rise to the mind of enlightenment in general for Subhūti;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c09_6']	二者、正明發心之義。	二者、正明發心之義。	002	The second is correctly clarifying the meaning of giving rise to the mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c09_11']	初則如文。	初則如文。	002	The first is as the text states.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c10_10']	今正辨菩提心，寧言如是降伏其心？	今正辨菩提心，寧言如是降伏其心？	002	Now that we are correctly discerning the mind of enlightenment, why speak of subjugating the mind in this way?
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c10_12']	答：	答：	002	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c11_13']	以發一菩提心故，不起凡夫及二乘心，即是降伏。	以發一菩提心故，不起凡夫及二乘心，即是降伏。	002	Because of giving rise to the one mind of enlightenment, one does not give rise to the mind of ordinary beings or the two vehicles, which is precisely subjugation.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c12_12']	初明遍度眾生，故異二乘心，降伏二乘；	初明遍度眾生，故異二乘心，降伏二乘；	002	First, it clarifies the universal salvation of sentient beings, thus differing from the minds of the two vehicles and subduing the two vehicles;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c13_6']	後明度無所度，是降伏凡夫心也。	後明度無所度，是降伏凡夫心也。	002	Later, it clarifies the salvation of the unsalvageable, which is the subduing of the minds of ordinary beings.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c13_18']	降伏二乘，即是以他降自；	降伏二乘，即是以他降自；	002	Subduing the two vehicles is precisely using the other to subdue oneself;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c14_12']	降伏凡夫心，即是以無降有也。	降伏凡夫心，即是以無降有也。	002	Subduing the minds of ordinary beings is precisely using the non-existent to subdue the existent.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c16_19']	又降伏二乘，亦得是以有降無，二乘無慈悲心、菩薩有慈悲心，故是以有降無，復以無降有，如前說也。	又降伏二乘，亦得是以有降無，二乘無慈悲心、菩薩有慈悲心，故是以有降無，復以無降有，如前說也。	002	Moreover, subduing the two vehicles can also be using the existent to subdue the non-existent, as the two vehicles lack the mind of compassion while bodhisattvas have the mind of compassion, thus using the existent to subdue the non-existent, and also using the non-existent to subdue the existent, as explained above.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c18_1']	又此中明大慈大悲，即降伏貪瞋煩惱，故名降伏。	又此中明大慈大悲，即降伏貪瞋煩惱，故名降伏。	002	Moreover, this clarifies great kindness and great compassion, which is precisely the subduing of the afflictions of greed and anger, thus called subduing.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c19_5']	又菩薩雖度眾生，實無眾生可度，即是降伏眾生見也。	又菩薩雖度眾生，實無眾生可度，即是降伏眾生見也。	002	Moreover, although bodhisattvas save sentient beings, there are actually no sentient beings to be saved, which is precisely the subduing of the view of sentient beings.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c20_2']	又菩薩若言有眾生可度，即是常見；	又菩薩若言有眾生可度，即是常見；	002	Moreover, if bodhisattvas say there are sentient beings to be saved, this is the view of permanence;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c20_15']	若言無眾生可度，則見斷見。	若言無眾生可度，則見斷見。	002	If they say there are no sentient beings to be saved, this is the view of annihilation.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c21_12']	今雖度眾生，實無所度，故降伏常見；	今雖度眾生，實無所度，故降伏常見；	002	Although now saving sentient beings, there is actually no one to save, thus subduing the view of permanence;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c22_9']	雖無所度，而常度眾生，故降伏斷見也。	雖無所度，而常度眾生，故降伏斷見也。	002	Although there is no one to save, always saving sentient beings, thus subduing the view of annihilation.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c23_10']	「所有一切眾生之類」下，此第二、正明發菩提心。	「所有一切眾生之類」下，此第二、正明發菩提心。	002	All kinds of sentient beings - this second part correctly clarifies the arising of the bodhi mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c24_17']	論偈云「廣大第一常，其心不顛倒，利益深心住，此乘功德滿。	論偈云「廣大第一常，其心不顛倒，利益深心住，此乘功德滿。	002	The treatise verse says: Vast, foremost, constant, the mind free from perversion, abiding in the mind of benefiting, the merit of this vehicle is fulfilled.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c25_7']	」故用於四心釋此經文。	」故用於四心釋此經文。	002	Therefore, using the four minds to explain this sutra text.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c25_11', 'ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c25_17']	四心者：🔽一、廣大心；	四心者： 一、廣大心；	002	The four minds are:🔽First, the vast mind;

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c26_16']	四者、不顛倒心。	四者、不顛倒心。	002	Fourth, the non-perverted mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c26_18']	問：	問：	002	Question:
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c27_3']	何因緣建乎四心？	何因緣建乎四心？	002	What causes and conditions give rise to the four minds?
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c27_5']	答：	答：	002	Answer:
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c27_22']	凡為菩薩，異凡夫、二乘，自調自度。	凡為菩薩，異凡夫、二乘，自調自度。	002	In general, being a bodhisattva is different from ordinary beings and the two vehicles who regulate themselves and save themselves.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c28_13']	今言遍度三界六道，名廣大心。	今言遍度三界六道，名廣大心。	002	Now, speaking of universally saving the three realms and six paths, is called the vast mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0101c29_16']	雖復遍度眾生，若遍與眾生人天之樂，名為下心；	雖復遍度眾生，若遍與眾生人天之樂，名為下心；	002	Although they may deliver sentient beings everywhere, if they give sentient beings the bliss of humans and gods everywhere, it is called a lesser mind;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a01_11']	若遍與眾生二乘之樂，名曰中心；	若遍與眾生二乘之樂，名曰中心；	002	if they give sentient beings the bliss of the two vehicles everywhere, it is called a middling mind;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a02_7']	今遍與眾生大涅槃樂，名第一心。	今遍與眾生大涅槃樂，名第一心。	002	now, giving sentient beings the bliss of great nirvāṇa everywhere is called the foremost mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a04_6']	菩薩雖復遍與眾生大涅槃樂，或時休息，生死道長、眾生性多，云何可遍度之令得常樂？	菩薩雖復遍與眾生大涅槃樂，或時休息，生死道長、眾生性多，云何可遍度之令得常樂？	002	Although bodhisattvas may give sentient beings the bliss of great nirvāṇa everywhere, they may sometimes rest. The path of birth and death is long and the nature of sentient beings is numerous. How can they deliver them all to attain constant bliss?
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a04_17']	是故於生死中起疲厭心。	是故於生死中起疲厭心。	002	Therefore, they give rise to a weary mind within birth and death.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a07_11']	今明生死邊如虛空、眾生性邊亦如虛空，是中無生死往來亦無解脫者，故能菩薩常度眾生、誨而不倦，名為常心。	今明生死邊如虛空、眾生性邊亦如虛空，是中無生死往來亦無解脫者，故能菩薩常度眾生、誨而不倦，名為常心。	002	Now, the limit of birth and death is like empty space, and the limit of the nature of sentient beings is also like empty space. Within this, there is no coming and going of birth and death, and there is also no one who is liberated. Therefore, bodhisattvas are always able to deliver sentient beings and instruct them without weariness. This is called the constant mind.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a08_12']	雖度眾生，而不見眾生可度，是名菩薩不顛倒心。	雖度眾生，而不見眾生可度，是名菩薩不顛倒心。	002	Although they deliver sentient beings, they do not see any sentient beings to be delivered. This is called the non-inverted mind of bodhisattvas.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a09_19']	以建此四心，住菩薩道，得大利益，故論云「利益深心住」。	以建此四心，住菩薩道，得大利益，故論云「利益深心住」。	002	Establishing these four minds, abiding in the bodhisattva path, and attaining great benefits, therefore the treatise says deeply benefiting mind abides.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a11_2']	是故建此四心，則菩提心滿足，故論云「此乘功德滿」。	是故建此四心，則菩提心滿足，故論云「此乘功德滿」。	002	Therefore, establishing these four minds, then the bodhi mind is fulfilled, therefore the treatise says this vehicle's merit is full.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0102a14_2']	雖有四心，不出慈悲般若，前三是慈悲心、後一是般若心，前是功德、後是智慧，前亦是方便、後名為實慧，故發心即具福慧，亦即具二慧。	雖有四心，不出慈悲般若，前三是慈悲心、後一是般若心，前是功德、後是智慧，前亦是方便、後名為實慧，故發心即具福慧，亦即具二慧。	002	Although there are four minds, they do not go beyond compassion and prajñā. The first three are the compassionate mind, and the last one is the prajñā mind. The former is merit, and the latter is wisdom. The former is also skillful means, and the latter is called true wisdom. Therefore, giving rise to the mind is endowed with merit and wisdom, and is also endowed with the two wisdoms.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0103a07_5', 'ZH_T33_1699_002:0103a07_18']	故《大論》云「慈悲與實相合行」。🔽大悲雖拔其苦，而實無所拔；	故《大論》云「慈悲與實相合行」。 大悲雖拔其苦，而實無所拔；	002	Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra says: Kindness and compassion are practiced in accordance with the true characteristics.🔽Although great compassion rescues from suffering, there is actually nothing to rescue;
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0103a08_10']	大慈雖與其樂，而實無所與。	大慈雖與其樂，而實無所與。	002	although great kindness bestows bliss, there is actually nothing to bestow.

Therefore, compassion is never not empty, and emptiness is never not compassionate.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0103a15_7']	今明修行亦與實相合行，故雖修萬行而實無所行、雖無所行而常修萬行，故行無所行，無所行故，具二慧也。	今明修行亦與實相合行，故雖修萬行而實無所行、雖無所行而常修萬行，故行無所行，無所行故，具二慧也。	002	Now, it is explained that cultivation is also in accord with the practice of true reality. Therefore, although one cultivates myriad practices, one actually has nothing to practice. Although one has nothing to practice, one always cultivates myriad practices.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0104a19_10']	若斷生疑心，則是廣說般若，故論云「自下一切修多羅中斷生疑心」，故知說經皆是斷生疑故也。	若斷生疑心，則是廣說般若，故論云「自下一切修多羅中斷生疑心」，故知說經皆是斷生疑故也。	002	If one cuts off the arising of doubt, this is extensively explaining prajñā.

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0104b07_19']	今明不可以諸相得見如來，即是諸佛空。	今明不可以諸相得見如來，即是諸佛空。	002	Now, explaining that the Tathāgata cannot be seen through various characteristics, is the emptiness of all buddhas.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0104b08_11']	故眾生無所有，則非眾生；	故眾生無所有，則非眾生；	002	Therefore, sentient beings having nothing, are not sentient beings;

['ZH_T33_1699_002:0104b10_6']	故非眾生非佛，非生死非涅槃，故眾生與佛本來不二。	故非眾生非佛，非生死非涅槃，故眾生與佛本來不二。	002	Thus, not sentient beings, not buddhas, not birth and death, not nirvāṇa, therefore sentient beings and buddhas are originally non-dual.
['ZH_T33_1699_002:0104b10_17']	然為破二見，故云不二。	然為破二見，故云不二。	002	However, in order to break the two views, it is said to be non-dual.
