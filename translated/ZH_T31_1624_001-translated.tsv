['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b08_12']	諸有欲令眼等五識以外色作所緣緣者，或執極微許有實體，能生識故；	諸有欲令眼等五識以外色作所緣緣者，或執極微許有實體，能生識故；	Those who wish to make external form the condition as object for the five consciousnesses such as the eye, either grasp the atom as having a real substance, because it can produce consciousness;
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b09_6']	或執和合，以識生時帶彼相故。	或執和合，以識生時帶彼相故。	Or they grasp the aggregate, because when consciousness arises, it takes on its appearance.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b09_11']	二俱非理。	二俱非理。	Both are unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b09_16']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b10_0']	極微於五識，　　設緣非所緣，	極微於五識，　　設緣非所緣，	The atom is a condition for the five consciousnesses, but not the object,
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b11_13']	彼相識無故，　　猶如眼根等。	彼相識無故，　　猶如眼根等。	Because the consciousness without its appearance is like the eye faculty, etc.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b13_7']	所緣緣者，謂能緣識帶彼相起，及有實體令能緣識託彼而生。	所緣緣者，謂能緣識帶彼相起，及有實體令能緣識託彼而生。	The condition as object is that which produces the consciousness that takes on its appearance, and which has a real substance that causes the consciousness to depend on it to arise.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b15_5']	色等極微，設有實體能生五識，容有緣義，然非所緣，如眼根等於眼等識無彼相故。	色等極微，設有實體能生五識，容有緣義，然非所緣，如眼根等於眼等識無彼相故。	Even if the atoms of form, etc. have a real substance that can produce the five consciousnesses, they may have the meaning of being a condition, but they are not the object, because like the eye faculty, etc., they do not have its appearance in the eye consciousness, etc.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b15_18']	如是極微於眼等識無所緣義。	如是極微於眼等識無所緣義。	In this way, the atom has no meaning as the object for the eye consciousness, etc.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b16_0']	和合於五識，　　設所緣非緣，	和合於五識，　　設所緣非緣，	The combination of the five consciousnesses, even if it is the object, is not the condition.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b17_13']	彼體實無故，　　猶如第二月。	彼體實無故，　　猶如第二月。	Because its substance is actually non-existent, like the second moon.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b19_2']	色等和合於眼識等有彼相故，設作所緣，然無緣義。	色等和合於眼識等有彼相故，設作所緣，然無緣義。	Because the combination of form, etc. has their characteristics in the eye consciousness, etc., even if it is the object, it does not have the meaning of being the condition.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b20_14']	如眼錯亂見第二月，彼無實體不能生故，如是和合於眼等識無有緣義。	如眼錯亂見第二月，彼無實體不能生故，如是和合於眼等識無有緣義。	Just as when the eyes are confused and see a second moon, it has no real substance and cannot produce [consciousness], so the combination does not have the meaning of being the condition for the eye consciousness, etc.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b21_13']	故外二事於所緣緣互闕一支，俱不應理。	故外二事於所緣緣互闕一支，俱不應理。	Therefore, the two external things lack one branch each in the object condition, and both are unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b23_6']	有執色等各有多相，於中一分是現量境，故諸極微相資各有一和集相。	有執色等各有多相，於中一分是現量境，故諸極微相資各有一和集相。	There is a view that form, etc. each have many characteristics, and one part of them is the object of direct perception. Therefore, each of the ultimate atoms has a combined characteristic.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b24_10']	此相實有，各能發生似己相識，故與五識作所緣緣。	此相實有，各能發生似己相識，故與五識作所緣緣。	This characteristic is real and each can produce a consciousness that resembles itself, so it acts as the object condition for the five consciousnesses.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b24_15']	此亦非理。	此亦非理。	This is also unreasonable.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b24_20']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is it so?
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b25_0']	和集如堅等，　　設於眼等識，	和集如堅等，　　設於眼等識，	The combination, like solidity, etc., even if it is in the eye consciousness, etc.,
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b26_13']	是緣非所緣，　　許極微相故。	是緣非所緣，　　許極微相故。	It is a condition but not an object, because it is admitted that the characteristics of atoms are so.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b28_12']	如堅等相雖是實有，於眼等識容有緣義，而非所緣，眼等識上無彼相故。	如堅等相雖是實有，於眼等識容有緣義，而非所緣，眼等識上無彼相故。	Although the characteristics of solidity, etc., are real, they are conditions for visual consciousness, etc., but are not objects, because they do not exist in visual consciousness, etc.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888b29_15']	色等極微諸和集相理亦應爾，彼俱執為極微相故。	色等極微諸和集相理亦應爾，彼俱執為極微相故。	The same should be the case with the characteristics of the aggregation of material atoms, etc. They are all admitted as being the characteristics of atoms.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c01_14']	執眼等識能緣極微諸和集相，復有別失。	執眼等識能緣極微諸和集相，復有別失。	If you insist that visual consciousness, etc., can have as objects the characteristics of the aggregation of atoms, there is another error.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c02_0']	瓶甌等覺相，　　彼執應無別，	瓶甌等覺相，　　彼執應無別，	The characteristics of the awareness of a pot and a bowl, etc., should not be different, because of the nondifference of form.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c03_13']	非形別故別，　　形別非實故。	非形別故別，　　形別非實故。	They are not different because of the difference of form, because the difference of form is not real.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c05_7']	瓶甌等物大小等者，能成極微多少同故，緣彼覺相應無差別。	瓶甌等物大小等者，能成極微多少同故，緣彼覺相應無差別。	The pot, bowl, etc., are the same in size, etc., because the number of atoms that can form them is the same. Therefore the characteristics of the awareness of them should not be different.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c06_7']	若謂彼物形相別故覺相別者，理亦不然。	若謂彼物形相別故覺相別者，理亦不然。	If you claim that the characteristics of awareness are different because the forms of those things are different, this is not reasonable.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c07_7']	頂等別形唯在瓶等假法上有，非極微故。	頂等別形唯在瓶等假法上有，非極微故。	The difference of form, such as the top, etc., exists only in the nominal things such as pots, etc., and not in atoms.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c08_1']	彼不應執極微亦有差別形相。	彼不應執極微亦有差別形相。	You should not insist that atoms also have different forms.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c08_6']	所以者何？	所以者何？	Why is this?
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c09_0']	極微量等故，　　形別惟在假，	極微量等故，　　形別惟在假，	Because the quantity of the most subtle atom is the same, and the difference of form exists only in the conventional.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c10_13']	析彼至極微，　　彼覺定捨故。	析彼至極微，　　彼覺定捨故。	When it is analyzed and reduced to the most subtle atom, the perception of it definitely ceases.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c12_7']	非瓶甌等能成極微有形量別捨微圓相，故知別形在假非實。	非瓶甌等能成極微有形量別捨微圓相，故知別形在假非實。	It is not that the pot, bowl, etc., which form the most subtle atoms, have a different quantity of form, and abandon the characteristics of subtlety and roundness. Therefore, we know that the difference of form exists in the conventional and is not real.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c13_2']	又形別物析至極微，彼覺定捨。	又形別物析至極微，彼覺定捨。	Moreover, when the different forms are analyzed and reduced to the most subtle atoms, the perception of them definitely ceases.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c13_16']	非青等物析至極微，彼覺可捨。	非青等物析至極微，彼覺可捨。	It is not that when the blue, etc., things are analyzed and reduced to the most subtle atoms, the perception of them can cease.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c15_13']	由此形別唯世俗有，非如青等亦在實物，是故五識所緣緣體非外色等，其理極成。	由此形別唯世俗有，非如青等亦在實物，是故五識所緣緣體非外色等，其理極成。	For this reason, the difference of form exists only in the conventional, and is not like the blue, etc., which also exist in real things. Therefore, the substance of the condition as object of the five consciousnesses is not external form, etc., and the principle is completely established.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c16_3']	彼所緣緣豈全不有？	彼所緣緣豈全不有？	How can it be that the condition as object of those [five consciousnesses] is completely nonexistent?
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c16_8']	非全不有。	非全不有。	It is not completely nonexistent.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c16_14', 'ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c17_0']	若爾，云何？🔽內色如外現，　　為識所緣緣，	若爾，云何？ 內色如外現，　　為識所緣緣，	If that is so, then what?🔽Internal form appears as external, and becomes the condition as object of consciousness,
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c18_13']	許彼相在識，　　及能生識故。	許彼相在識，　　及能生識故。	Because it is admitted that its characteristics exist in consciousness, and because it is able to produce consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c19_17']	外境雖無，而有內色似外境現為所緣緣。	外境雖無，而有內色似外境現為所緣緣。	Although external objects do not exist, there is internal form that appears resembling external objects and serves as the condition as object.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c20_16']	許眼等識帶彼相起及從彼生，具二義故。	許眼等識帶彼相起及從彼生，具二義故。	It is admitted that eye consciousness, etc., arise with the appearance of that form and from that form, because they possess two meanings.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c21_15']	此內境相既不離識，如何俱起能作識緣？	此內境相既不離識，如何俱起能作識緣？	Since the appearance of the internal object is not separate from consciousness, how can it arise simultaneously with consciousness and serve as its condition?
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c22_13']	決定相隨故，　　俱時亦作緣；	決定相隨故，　　俱時亦作緣；	Because the appearance definitely follows consciousness, it can also serve as a condition simultaneously;
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c23_13']	或前為後緣，　　引彼功能故。	或前為後緣，　　引彼功能故。	Or the former serves as a condition for the latter, because it attracts the power of the latter.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c24_17']	境相與識定相隨故，雖俱時起亦作識緣。	境相與識定相隨故，雖俱時起亦作識緣。	Because the appearance of the object definitely follows consciousness, even though it arises simultaneously with consciousness, it can also serve as a condition for consciousness.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c25_3']	因明者說：	因明者說：	Logicians say:
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c26_6']	若此與彼有無相隨，雖俱時生，而亦得有因果相故。	若此與彼有無相隨，雖俱時生，而亦得有因果相故。	If this and that are mutually dependent in existence, even though they are born simultaneously, they can still have the relationship of cause and effect.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c27_14']	或前識相為後識緣，引本識中生似自果功能令起，不違理故。	或前識相為後識緣，引本識中生似自果功能令起，不違理故。	Or the appearance of a former consciousness serves as a condition for a subsequent consciousness, attracting the power in the fundamental consciousness to produce an effect that resembles itself and causing it to arise, because this does not contradict reason.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c28_13']	若五識生唯緣內色，如何亦說眼等為緣？	若五識生唯緣內色，如何亦說眼等為緣？	If the five consciousnesses are born with only internal form as their object, how can it be said that the eye, etc., are conditions?
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0888c29_0']	識上色功能，　　名五根應理，	識上色功能，　　名五根應理，	The power of form in consciousness is properly called the five organs.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0889a01_13']	功能與境色，　　無始互為因。	功能與境色，　　無始互為因。	Function and objective form have been mutually causal since beginningless [time].
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0889a04_6']	以能發識比知有根，此但功能，非外所造，故本識上五色功能名眼等根亦不違理，功能發識理無別故。	以能發識比知有根，此但功能，非外所造，故本識上五色功能名眼等根亦不違理，功能發識理無別故。	Inferring the existence of the faculties by their ability to generate consciousness, they are merely functions and not external creations. Therefore, the five colors of function on the fundamental consciousness named eye, etc., are also not contrary to reason, because the principle of generating consciousness by function is no different.
['ZH_T31_1624_001:0889a05_14']	在識在餘雖不可說，而外諸法理非有故，定應許此在識非餘。	在識在餘雖不可說，而外諸法理非有故，定應許此在識非餘。	Although it cannot be said whether they are in consciousness or elsewhere, still, because external dharmas are not reasonable, one must definitely admit that they are in consciousness and not elsewhere.

These five internal objective forms are again able to induce the five faculties of function on the consciousness as retribution.
