['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c16_13']	此等皆能生福，如世之田。	此等皆能生福，如世之田。	These are all able to produce blessings, like fields in the world.

['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c18_12']	故《智論》十四云「一憐愍施，謂於貧窮下賤及畜生。	故《智論》十四云「一憐愍施，謂於貧窮下賤及畜生。	Therefore, the Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom, fascicle 14, says: First, compassionate giving, referring to the poor, the lowly, and animals.

['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c21_18']	其非敬非悲，亦悲田攝，無德可敬故。	其非敬非悲，亦悲田攝，無德可敬故。	That which is neither respected nor pitied is also categorized as a field of compassion, because there is no virtue to be respected.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c23_14']	」然此二田，以理御心則等無優劣，故《淨名》云「最下乞人猶如如來福田無異。	」然此二田，以理御心則等無優劣，故《淨名》云「最下乞人猶如如來福田無異。	However, if one uses principle to govern the mind in relation to these two fields, they are equal and without superiority or inferiority. Therefore, the Vimalakīrti Sūtra says, The lowest beggar is like the Tathāgata, and the field of merit is no different.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c24_6']	」無所分別，等于大悲。	」無所分別，等于大悲。	Without discrimination, they are equal in great compassion.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c25_15']	若直就境論，則敬強悲劣，以恩深德厚故，如《校量功德經》說。	若直就境論，則敬強悲劣，以恩深德厚故，如《校量功德經》說。	If we discuss it directly in terms of the object, then respect is stronger and compassion is weaker, because the kindness is deeper and the virtue is greater. As the Sūtra on the Comparison of Merits says.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c26_10']	若就於心，即悲田為勝，親引悲故。	若就於心，即悲田為勝，親引悲故。	If we discuss it in terms of the mind, then the field of compassion is superior, because it directly induces compassion.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c28_1']	故敬則田強而悲心弱，悲則田弱而悲心強，各有其美，俱為良田。	故敬則田強而悲心弱，悲則田弱而悲心強，各有其美，俱為良田。	Therefore, in respect, the field is strong but the compassionate mind is weak, and in compassion, the field is weak but the compassionate mind is strong. Each has its beauty and is a good field.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0716c29_10']	若等是敬田，恩則勝德，故《校量經》云「供百羅漢不及一生身父母。	若等是敬田，恩則勝德，故《校量經》云「供百羅漢不及一生身父母。	If they are equally fields of respect, then kindness is superior to virtue. Therefore, the Sūtra on the Comparison of Merits says, It is not as good as supporting one's parents in one's lifetime.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a01_12']	」《阿含》中說供養父母，共一生補處功德齊等。	」《阿含》中說供養父母，共一生補處功德齊等。	The Āgamas say that supporting one's parents is equal in merit to supporting one who is about to become a Buddha.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a03_7']	若同是恩田，在家人則父母恩勝，出家則師僧恩勝，如《舍利弗請問經》說。	若同是恩田，在家人則父母恩勝，出家則師僧恩勝，如《舍利弗請問經》說。	If they are all fields of blessings, then for laypeople the blessings of parents are superior, and for those who have left the household life the blessings of teachers and the monastic community are superior, as explained in the Śāriputra Questions Sutra.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a04_5']	或約生色身及生法身，則優劣可知矣。	或約生色身及生法身，則優劣可知矣。	Or, in terms of giving rise to the physical body and giving rise to the Dharma body, the superiority and inferiority can be known.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a05_3']	等是德田，別不如普，故《梵網經》說：	等是德田，別不如普，故《梵網經》說：	As for being fields of virtue, specific is not as good as universal, so the Brahma Net Sutra says:
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a06_3']	別請五百羅漢菩薩僧，不如僧次一凡夫僧。	別請五百羅漢菩薩僧，不如僧次一凡夫僧。	Inviting five hundred arhats and bodhisattvas is not as good as inviting an ordinary monk in the monastic community.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a07_6']	又由主財田異，感報勝劣種種不同，恐繁不載。	又由主財田異，感報勝劣種種不同，恐繁不載。	Moreover, due to the differences in the host, wealth, and field, the rewards they give rise to are various and different, but for fear of being too verbose, I will not list them all here.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a10_15']	然今此中菩薩施心，悲智齊於虛空、事物窮乎法界，施田凡聖盡於十方故，三事性空深無底、三事殊特勝無比、三事廣大遍無涯、三事相融俱無礙。	然今此中菩薩施心，悲智齊於虛空、事物窮乎法界，施田凡聖盡於十方故，三事性空深無底、三事殊特勝無比、三事廣大遍無涯、三事相融俱無礙。	However, in this case, the bodhisattva's mind of giving is equal to empty space in compassion and wisdom, and the things and objects extend to the Dharma realm. The fields of giving, whether ordinary or holy, extend to the ten directions, so the three aspects are empty in nature, profound and bottomless, the three aspects are unique and superior, incomparable, the three aspects are vast and pervasive, and the three aspects are mutually inclusive, without obstruction.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a12_2']	二迴向行中，初一果地、餘九因地，各相似義，如理應思。	二迴向行中，初一果地、餘九因地，各相似義，如理應思。	In the second, the practice of dedication, the first is the fruition ground, the remaining nine are the causal ground, each with a corresponding meaning, as should be contemplated according to reason.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a12_9']	四十八施僮僕。	四十八施僮僕。	48. Giving servants.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a12_19']	少美曰僮，以擬瞻侍。	少美曰僮，以擬瞻侍。	Young and handsome are called servants, suitable for attending and serving.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a13_9']	執守曰僕，以備勞役。	執守曰僕，以備勞役。	Those who are held and guarded are called servants, to be employed in hard labor.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a15_10']	然不放之從良而施與人，還令成僕者，以菩薩行海無善不修，若唯放從良，有三義缺：	然不放之從良而施與人，還令成僕者，以菩薩行海無善不修，若唯放從良，有三義缺：	However, not releasing them to become good people but giving them to others, still making them servants, is because the bodhisattva's practice ocean has no goodness not cultivated. If only releasing them to become good people, there are three meanings lacking:
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a16_15']	一行海不具、二彼僕本願不滿、三佛果缺此應機之德。	一行海不具、二彼僕本願不滿、三佛果缺此應機之德。	1. The practice ocean is not complete, 2. The original vow of those servants is not fulfilled, 3. The Buddha fruition lacks this virtue of responding to capacities.
['ZH_T35_1735_029:0717a17_1']	餘可知。	餘可知。	The rest can be known.
